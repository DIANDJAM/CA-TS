43 BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WARD AND

01:01:50.373 --> 01:01:52.608
OTHERS RELATIVE TO LESBIAN, GAY,

01:01:52.675 --> 01:01:54.077
BISEXUAL, TRANSGENDER, AND QUEER

01:01:54.143 --> 01:01:55.845
PRIDE MONTH ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:01:55.912 --> 01:01:57.713
WARD. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK

01:01:57.780 --> 01:01:59.682
YOU, MR. SPEAKER, AND MEMBERS.

01:01:59.749 --> 01:02:00.783
AS CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:02.718
LEGISLATIVE LGBTQ CAUCUS, I RISE

01:02:02.785 --> 01:02:05.288
TODAY TO PRESENT H.R. 43 TO

01:02:05.354 --> 01:02:07.323
OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZE JUNE 2025

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:09.559
AS LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,

01:02:09.625 --> 01:02:11.027
TRANSGENDER, AND QUEER PRIDE

01:02:11.094 --> 01:02:12.762
MONTH. EACH YEAR, PRIDE MONTH

01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:14.897
REMINDS US OF OUR COLLECTIVE

01:02:14.964 --> 01:02:16.332
RESPONSIBILITY TO SUPPORT OUR

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:18.067
LGBTQ COMMUNITY MEMBERS,

01:02:18.134 --> 01:02:19.669
CELEBRATE THE BEAUTY OF OUR

01:02:19.735 --> 01:02:20.970
DIVERSITY, AND AFFIRM THAT

01:02:21.037 --> 01:02:22.071
EVERYONE DESERVES TO LIVE OPENLY

01:02:22.138 --> 01:02:23.940
AND AUTHENTICALLY WITHOUT FEAR

01:02:24.006 --> 01:02:27.210
OR SILENCE. PRIDE IS BOTH

01:02:27.276 --> 01:02:29.011
CELEBRATION AND CONFRONTATION,

01:02:29.078 --> 01:02:31.114
EQUAL PARTS JOY AND JUSTICE, AND

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:32.415
HONORS OUR JOURNEY AND DEMANDS

01:02:32.482 --> 01:02:34.684
THAT WE PROTECT OUR FUTURE. THAT

01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:36.552
CHARGE FEELS HEAVIER AND MORE

01:02:36.619 --> 01:02:38.287
URGENT THIS YEAR MORE THAN EVER.

01:02:38.354 --> 01:02:39.956
AS WE GATHER IN PRIDE THIS YEAR,

01:02:40.022 --> 01:02:42.258
WE DO SO UNDER THE WEIGHT OF

01:02:42.325 --> 01:02:43.192
HOSTILITY TOWARDS OUR COMMUNITY,

01:02:43.259 --> 01:02:45.094
ESPECIALLY TARGETING OUR

01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:46.195
TRANSGENDER, NON-BINARY AND

01:02:46.262 --> 01:02:49.098
INTERSEX SIBLINGS. NEARLY 600

01:02:49.165 --> 01:02:51.334
ANTI LGBTQ BILLS HAVE BEEN

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:52.301
INTRODUCED IN STATE LEGISLATURES

01:02:52.368 --> 01:02:54.137
ACROSS THIS COUNTRY THIS YEAR,

01:02:54.203 --> 01:02:56.706
SEEKING TO RESTRICT EXISTING

01:02:56.772 --> 01:02:58.241
EQUAL RIGHTS FOR LGBTQ PEOPLE,

01:02:58.307 --> 01:03:00.109
IN PARTICULAR OUR TRANSGENDER

01:03:00.176 --> 01:03:01.644
SIBLINGS AND THEIR FAMILIES. LET

01:03:01.711 --> 01:03:04.247
US BE CLEAR THESE AREN'T

01:03:04.313 --> 01:03:05.281
ISOLATED INCIDENTS. THEY ARE

01:03:05.348 --> 01:03:06.949
PART OF A COORDINATED EFFORT TO

01:03:07.016 --> 01:03:09.452
PUSH US BACK INTO THE SHADOWS.

01:03:09.519 --> 01:03:11.154
HOWEVER, AS ONE OF OUR LESBIAN

01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:13.556
ELDERS WHO MARCHED AT PRIDE IN

01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:15.625
1973 RECENTLY REMINDED US, WE

01:03:15.691 --> 01:03:17.493
ARE AT ANOTHER TURNING POINT.

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:18.861
AND LIKE THOSE WHO STOOD AT

01:03:18.928 --> 01:03:21.230
STONEWALL AND THOSE WHO ROSE UP

01:03:21.297 --> 01:03:22.165
AT COMPTON'S CAFETERIA THREE

01:03:22.231 --> 01:03:23.599
YEARS EARLIER, WE MUST MEET THIS

01:03:23.666 --> 01:03:25.401
MOMENT NOT WITH RETREAT, BUT

01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:28.271
WITH RESOLVE, BECAUSE PRIDE WAS

01:03:28.337 --> 01:03:29.705
NEVER ABOUT PERMISSION. IT WAS

01:03:29.772 --> 01:03:32.542
NEVER ABOUT COMFORT. PRIDE IS

01:03:32.608 --> 01:03:33.643
DEFIANCE. PRIDE IS REMEMBERING

01:03:33.709 --> 01:03:35.178
THAT THE RAINBOW FLAG WAS SEWN

01:03:35.244 --> 01:03:37.613
IN RESISTANCE, THAT MARCHES ARE

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:40.082
BORN FROM MOVEMENTS, THAT LGBTQ

01:03:40.149 --> 01:03:41.984
HISTORIC LEADERS MATTER, AND SO

01:03:42.051 --> 01:03:44.020
DO THE STORIES BEHIND THOSE WHO

01:03:44.086 --> 01:03:47.223
ROSE WITH THEM. WE NOW SEE HOW

01:03:47.290 --> 01:03:49.559
EVEN THE DISPLAY OF A FLAG CAN

01:03:49.625 --> 01:03:52.094
SPARK PROTEST, BUT THAT TELLS US

01:03:52.161 --> 01:03:54.463
SOMETHING IMPORTANT PRIDE STILL

01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:57.300
HAS POWER. THAT POWER CANNOT BE

01:03:57.366 --> 01:03:59.101
LEGISLATED AWAY. IT CANNOT BE

01:03:59.168 --> 01:04:01.037
BANNED, ERASED, OR CANCELED NO

01:04:01.103 --> 01:04:03.539
MATTER HOW MANY TIMES THEY TRY.

01:04:03.606 --> 01:04:04.907
YES, WE'VE MADE MEANINGFUL

01:04:04.974 --> 01:04:05.942
PROGRESS. EMPLOYEES ARE NO

01:04:06.008 --> 01:04:07.810
LONGER FIRED FOR WHO THEY LOVE.

01:04:07.877 --> 01:04:09.212
MARRIAGE EQUALITY IS LEGALIZED

01:04:09.278 --> 01:04:11.214
HERE FOR NOW AND IN COUNTRIES

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:13.716
AROUND THE GLOBE, LGBTQ FAMILIES

01:04:13.783 --> 01:04:15.451
ARE BEING RECOGNIZED SIMILAR TO

01:04:15.518 --> 01:04:16.919
OUR STRAIGHT COUNTERPARTS. AND

01:04:16.986 --> 01:04:18.221
THAT BEING SAID, MEMBERS, IT'S

01:04:18.287 --> 01:04:20.089
NOT LOST ON US THAT THESE GAINS

01:04:20.156 --> 01:04:22.491
ARE NOT GUARANTEED. NONE ARE

01:04:22.558 --> 01:04:25.061
PERMANENT UNLESS WE DEFEND THEM.

01:04:25.127 --> 01:04:26.229
TRANSGENDER SERVICE MEMBERS ARE

01:04:26.295 --> 01:04:27.597
BEING EXPELLED FROM THE

01:04:27.663 --> 01:04:29.065
MILITARY. FAMILIES ARE LOSING

01:04:29.131 --> 01:04:30.132
THEIR RIGHT TO PROVIDE THE

01:04:30.199 --> 01:04:31.601
NECESSARY HEALTH CARE FOR THEIR

01:04:31.667 --> 01:04:33.736
KIDS. EFFORTS ARE UNDERWAY TO

01:04:33.803 --> 01:04:34.804
ROLL BACK MARRIAGE EQUALITY

01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:36.639
RIGHTS AND FORCE LGBTQ PEOPLE

01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:38.841
INTO CONVERSION THERAPY. THIS IS

01:04:38.908 --> 01:04:41.077
WHY PRIDE MONTH STILL MATTERS.

01:04:41.143 --> 01:04:43.412
IT'S A TIME TO SHOW UP, TO SPEAK

01:04:43.479 --> 01:04:45.881
OUT, TO STAND FIRM. WE CANNOT

01:04:45.948 --> 01:04:47.783
WAVER IN OUR CELEBRATION, AND WE

01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:49.986
WILL NOT SHRINK IN OUR

01:04:50.052 --> 01:04:50.953
VISIBILITY TO MAKE OTHERS

01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:52.722
COMFORTABLE. TO OUR COLLEAGUES

01:04:52.788 --> 01:04:54.423
WHO ARE NOT MEMBERS OF OUR

01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:56.125
CAUCUS, YOUR PRESENCE AND

01:04:56.192 --> 01:04:57.493
SUPPORT DURING THIS MONTH

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:59.362
MATTERS. WE NEED ALLIES, OLD AND

01:04:59.428 --> 01:05:01.130
NEW TO STAND BESIDE US,

01:05:01.197 --> 01:05:02.198
ESPECIALLY AS THESE ATTACKS

01:05:02.265 --> 01:05:04.367
BECOME MORE STRATEGIC, MORE

01:05:04.433 --> 01:05:06.535
VICIOUS AND MORE PERSONAL,

01:05:06.602 --> 01:05:08.037
BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENS

01:05:08.104 --> 01:05:10.106
WHEN WE CHOOSE SILENCE. AND AS

01:05:10.172 --> 01:05:11.774
SUCH, WE WON'T LET HISTORY

01:05:11.841 --> 01:05:13.609
REPEAT ITSELF. WE ALSO KNOW THAT

01:05:13.676 --> 01:05:15.211
THIS MONTH OFFERS SOMETHING

01:05:15.278 --> 01:05:17.413
POWERFUL COMMUNITY, A REMINDER

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:19.248
THAT WE ARE NOT ALONE IN OUR

01:05:19.315 --> 01:05:20.916
STRUGGLE AND IN OUR JOY. PRIDE

01:05:20.983 --> 01:05:22.685
IS WHAT IS WHERE MANY OF US

01:05:22.752 --> 01:05:24.553
FIRST SAW PEOPLE WHO LOVE LIKE

01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:27.023
US, PEOPLE WHO LOOKED LIKE US,

01:05:27.089 --> 01:05:28.724
AND PEOPLE WHO DREAMT LIKE US.

01:05:28.791 --> 01:05:31.260
IT IS WHERE WE FOUND FAMILY AND

01:05:31.327 --> 01:05:33.829
IT IS WHERE WE FOUND HOPE. SO I

01:05:33.896 --> 01:05:35.698
SAY TO OUR LGBTQ COMMUNITY

01:05:35.765 --> 01:05:37.433
MEMBERS THAT YOU ARE SEEN,

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:39.201
VALUED AND LOVED NOT JUST THIS

01:05:39.268 --> 01:05:41.170
MONTH, BUT EVERY MONTH. AND TO

01:05:41.237 --> 01:05:43.306
THOSE WHO WOULD RATHER SEE US, A

01:05:43.372 --> 01:05:44.774
RACE WILL NEVER GIVE UP. WE'RE

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:46.809
NOT GOING TO REGRESS, AND WE'RE

01:05:46.876 --> 01:05:48.811
NOT GOING TO GO BACK INTO THE

01:05:48.878 --> 01:05:50.046
CLOSET. ON BEHALF OF THE

01:05:50.112 --> 01:05:51.113
CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE LGBTQ

01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:53.015

01:08:51.894 --> 01:08:53.729
DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE,

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:55.331
DOCTOR RACHEL LEVINE, ASSISTANT

01:08:55.397 --> 01:08:56.966
SECRETARY FOR HEALTH OF THE

01:08:57.032 --> 01:08:57.900
UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF

01:08:57.967 --> 01:08:59.768
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND

01:08:59.835 --> 01:09:01.971
THE FIRST TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUAL

01:09:02.037 --> 01:09:03.772
TO HOLD A FEDERAL POSITION THAT

01:09:03.839 --> 01:09:06.308
REQUIRES SENATE CONFIRMATION.

01:09:06.375 --> 01:09:08.844
AND, OF COURSE, OUR VERY OWN

01:09:08.911 --> 01:09:10.446
CO-CHAIR OF THE JEWISH CAUCUS,

01:09:10.513 --> 01:09:12.381
SENATOR SCOTT WIENER. WE ARE

01:09:12.448 --> 01:09:13.883
PROUD TO HAVE DOUBLED THE SIZE

01:09:13.949 --> 01:09:16.285
OF THE LGBTQ CONTINGENCY IN OUR

01:09:16.352 --> 01:09:18.521
JEWISH CAUCUS AND LOOK FORWARD

01:09:18.587 --> 01:09:19.622
TO INCREASING OUR SIZE FURTHER

01:09:19.688 --> 01:09:21.857
IN THE COMING YEARS. WELL, THIS

01:09:21.924 --> 01:09:23.959
IS A TIME FOR CELEBRATION. WE

01:09:24.026 --> 01:09:25.594
MUST ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS

01:09:25.661 --> 01:09:28.063
YEAR IS DIFFERENT. WE ARE

01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:29.598
FEELING A REVERSAL OF THE

01:09:29.665 --> 01:09:31.767
PROGRESS TOWARDS LGBTQ, PLUS

01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:33.235
RIGHTS THAT HAVE TAKEN DECADES

01:09:33.302 --> 01:09:36.038
AND GENERATIONS TO OBTAIN. THE

01:09:36.105 --> 01:09:37.306
AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION

01:09:37.373 --> 01:09:41.210
IS CURRENTLY TRACKING NEARLY 600

01:09:41.277 --> 01:09:42.278
ANTI-LGBTQ+ BILLS ACROSS THE

01:09:42.344 --> 01:09:44.246
UNITED STATES. FEDERAL EFFORTS

01:09:44.313 --> 01:09:46.382
ARE ALSO UNDERWAY TO DISAPPEAR.

01:09:46.448 --> 01:09:48.751
BOTH LGBTQ PLUS INDIVIDUALS AND

01:09:48.817 --> 01:09:51.287
THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE. THE

01:09:51.353 --> 01:09:53.389
WHITE HOUSE HAS REFUSED TO

01:09:53.455 --> 01:09:55.090
ACKNOWLEDGE PRIDE MONTH THIS

01:09:55.157 --> 01:09:58.127
YEAR. SO, TOO, THE NAVY HAS

01:09:58.193 --> 01:10:00.963
ANNOUNCED PLANS TO RENAME A SHIP

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:03.399
NAMED AFTER ONE OF OUR HEROES,

01:10:03.465 --> 01:10:05.834
HARVEY MILK, A MILITARY VETERAN

01:10:05.901 --> 01:10:08.537
WHO BECAME THE FIRST OPENLY GAY

01:10:08.604 --> 01:10:10.205
CALIFORNIA POLITICIAN WHO WAS

01:10:10.272 --> 01:10:12.908
ALSO PROUDLY JEWISH. THE MESSAGE

01:10:12.975 --> 01:10:14.843
IS CLEAR THEY WANT TO PRETEND

01:10:14.910 --> 01:10:17.112
THE COMMUNITY DOESN'T EXIST OR

01:10:17.179 --> 01:10:19.648
THAT IT ISN'T WORTHY OF HONOR,

01:10:19.715 --> 01:10:21.050
AS OUR JEWISH COMMUNITY IS

01:10:21.116 --> 01:10:23.953
INTIMATELY AWARE, THIS RHETORIC

01:10:24.019 --> 01:10:25.821
WILL LEAD TO VIOLENCE IF, IF

01:10:25.888 --> 01:10:27.957
LEFT UNCHECKED, WE MUST DO

01:10:28.023 --> 01:10:29.458
EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO

01:10:29.525 --> 01:10:31.193
ENSURE EQUALITY FOR EVERYONE, TO

01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:32.861
UPLIFT THE HEROISM AND STRENGTH

01:10:32.928 --> 01:10:34.730
OF DIVERSE COMMUNITIES, AND

01:10:34.797 --> 01:10:36.065
AFFIRM THAT EVERY PERSON

01:10:36.131 --> 01:10:38.033
DESERVES AND WILL BE GRANTED THE

01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:39.935
JUST AND EQUAL TREATMENT THAT IS

01:10:40.002 --> 01:10:42.071
OUR NATION'S PROMISE. THERE IS

01:10:42.137 --> 01:10:43.505
STILL SO MUCH TO BE DONE, BUT

01:10:43.572 --> 01:10:45.274
THE JEWISH CAUCUS WILL STAND

01:10:45.341 --> 01:10:47.042
STRONG AND PROUD WITH THE LGBTQ

01:10:47.109 --> 01:10:49.912

01:10:56.418 --> 01:10:57.419

DISCRIMINATION AND ADVANCE THE

01:11:27.483 --> 01:11:30.219

US ALL OF THE POWER OF UNITY AND

01:11:32.888 --> 01:11:35.057
THE IMPORTANCE OF STANDING

01:11:35.124 --> 01:11:36.659
TOGETHER, ESPECIALLY IN THESE

01:11:36.725 --> 01:11:38.761
CHALLENGING TIMES. COLLEAGUES,

LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF

H.R. 43, WHICH DESIGNATES JUNE

01:12:01.817 --> 01:12:03.719
AS PRIDE MONTH. PRIDE MONTH IS A

01:12:03.786 --> 01:12:05.187
VIBRANT, INCLUSIVE, AND DEEPLY

01:12:05.254 --> 01:12:07.356
MEANINGFUL TIME TO HONOR THE

01:12:07.423 --> 01:12:09.391
LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY. OUR RICH

01:12:09.458 --> 01:12:10.626
HISTORY, REMARKABLE

01:12:10.693 --> 01:12:11.827
ACHIEVEMENTS, AND THE CONTINUED

01:12:11.894 --> 01:12:13.629
FIGHT FOR EQUALITY. THE VERY

01:12:13.696 --> 01:12:16.065
FIRST PRIDE WAS NOT A PARADE. IT

01:12:16.131 --> 01:12:18.133
WAS A PROTEST. THE STONEWALL

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:19.902
UPRISING IN 1969 SPARKED A

01:12:19.968 --> 01:12:22.471
GLOBAL MOVEMENT LED BY LGBTQ

01:12:22.538 --> 01:12:24.606
PLUS INDIVIDUALS, ESPECIALLY

01:12:24.673 --> 01:12:26.208
TRANSGENDER WOMEN OF COLOR, WHO

01:12:26.275 --> 01:12:27.543
STOOD UP AGAINST POLICE VIOLENCE

01:12:27.609 --> 01:12:29.712
AND DISCRIMINATION. THEY BRAVELY

01:12:29.778 --> 01:12:31.113
LAID THE FOUNDATION FOR THE

01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:32.114
PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE AND THE

01:12:32.181 --> 01:12:34.383
STRIDES WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE

01:12:34.450 --> 01:12:35.751
TODAY. PRIDE BRINGS TOGETHER

01:12:35.818 --> 01:12:37.119
INDIVIDUALS, ORGANIZATIONS AND

01:12:37.186 --> 01:12:38.287
ENTIRE COMMUNITIES TO CELEBRATE

01:12:38.353 --> 01:12:39.822
HOW FAR WE'VE COME AND TO

01:12:39.888 --> 01:12:41.490
RECOMMIT OURSELVES TO THE WORK

01:12:41.557 --> 01:12:43.125
THAT STILL LIES AHEAD. IT'S A

01:12:43.192 --> 01:12:44.893
MOMENT OF SOLIDARITY FOR ALL OF

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:45.861
US WHO BELIEVE IN HUMAN DIGNITY,

01:12:45.928 --> 01:12:48.097
CIVIL RIGHTS, AND THE POWER OF

01:12:48.163 --> 01:12:49.465
LOVE OVER HATE. AS WE FLY THE

01:12:49.531 --> 01:12:51.266
RAINBOW FLAG OVER OUR STATE

01:12:51.333 --> 01:12:52.267
CAPITOL, LET US REMEMBER WHAT

01:12:52.334 --> 01:12:54.770
THE COLORS STAND FOR LIFE,

01:12:54.837 --> 01:12:57.072
HEALING, SUNLIGHT, NATURE,

01:12:57.139 --> 01:12:59.074
SERENITY, AND SPIRIT. THE

01:12:59.141 --> 01:13:00.275
SYMBOLISM BEHIND THESE COLORS

01:13:00.342 --> 01:13:01.643
REPRESENT REAL PEOPLE, REAL

01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:04.146
LIVED EXPERIENCES, AND CONTINUED

01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:05.981
REPRESSION. PRIDE MONTH SERVES

01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:07.883
AS A POWERFUL REMINDER OF THE

01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:09.218
IMPORTANCE OF ACCEPTANCE,

01:13:09.284 --> 01:13:11.053
DIVERSITY, AND LOVE. WE MUST

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:12.221
RESPECT THESE VALUES IN

01:13:12.287 --> 01:13:13.989
CELEBRATION, BUT IN POLICY,

01:13:14.056 --> 01:13:15.858
REPRESENTATION AND HOW WE TREAT

01:13:15.924 --> 01:13:16.792
ONE ANOTHER. WITH THAT, I

01:13:16.859 --> 01:13:19.128
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE.

01:13:19.194 --> 01:13:19.895
COLLEAGUES, THANK YOU, ASSEMBLY

01:13:19.962 --> 01:13:23.332
MEMBER LEE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MARK

01:13:23.398 --> 01:13:24.700
GONZALEZ, YOU'RE RECOGNIZED.

01:13:24.767 --> 01:13:26.001
THANK YOU, MADAM SPEAKER. TODAY

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:27.603
I RISE ON BEHALF OF THE

01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:28.704
CALIFORNIA LATINO LEGISLATIVE

01:13:28.771 --> 01:13:30.539
CAUCUS AS A PROUD PRINCIPAL

01:13:30.606 --> 01:13:32.975
COAUTHOR OF H.R. 43. AS I

01:13:33.041 --> 01:13:34.143
PREPARED THESE REMARKS TODAY, I

01:13:34.209 --> 01:13:35.911
FOUND MYSELF REFLECTING NOT JUST

01:13:35.978 --> 01:13:37.613
ON HOW FAR WE'VE COME, BUT ON

01:13:37.679 --> 01:13:38.781
THE CRISIS THAT WE ARE LIVING

01:13:38.847 --> 01:13:41.016
THROUGH AS A NATION TODAY.

01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:43.218
BECAUSE PRIDE, REAL PRIDE IS NOT

01:13:43.285 --> 01:13:44.920
ABOUT GLITTER OR RAINBOWS OR

01:13:44.987 --> 01:13:46.688
PARADES. IT'S NOT ABOUT PARTIES

01:13:46.755 --> 01:13:48.891
OR DANCING AT THE PINK PONY.

01:13:48.957 --> 01:13:50.159
PRIDE, AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN

01:13:50.225 --> 01:13:52.561
JOSE SAID, HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND

01:13:52.628 --> 01:13:55.264
WILL EVER, FOREVER BE A PROTEST.

01:13:55.330 --> 01:13:57.366
OVER 50 YEARS AGO WITH THE

01:13:57.432 --> 01:13:58.600
STONEWALL INN, OUR LGBTQ PLUS

01:13:58.667 --> 01:14:00.269
SIBLINGS STOOD UP AGAINST

01:14:00.335 --> 01:14:01.837
BRUTALITY, AGAINST

01:14:01.904 --> 01:14:03.205
DISCRIMINATION, AND AGAINST A

01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:04.640
GOVERNMENT THAT TARGETED THEM

01:14:04.706 --> 01:14:07.843
SIMPLY FOR EXISTING. THEY ROSE

01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:09.778
UP TOGETHER AND SPARKED A

01:14:09.845 --> 01:14:11.947
MOVEMENT THAT WOULD CHANGE THE

01:14:12.014 --> 01:14:12.948
COURSE OF HISTORY AS WE KNOW IT.

01:14:13.015 --> 01:14:15.150
FROM THE UPRISING CAME PROGRESS.

01:14:15.217 --> 01:14:17.019
WHEN THEN MAYOR GAVIN NEWSOM,

01:14:17.085 --> 01:14:18.754
MAKING PROGRESS IN HISTORY WITH

01:14:18.821 --> 01:14:20.122
MARRIAGE EQUALITY IN SAN

01:14:20.189 --> 01:14:21.990
FRANCISCO, THE SUPREME COURT

01:14:22.057 --> 01:14:23.025
AFFIRMING THE RIGHT TO MARRY WHO

01:14:23.091 --> 01:14:24.827
YOU LOVE HARD WON ACCESS TO

01:14:24.893 --> 01:14:27.396
HEALTH CARE FOR THE COMMUNITY,

01:14:27.462 --> 01:14:28.897
GENERATIONAL INVESTMENTS IN HIV,

01:14:28.964 --> 01:14:30.599
AIDS PREVENTION, AND SO MUCH

01:14:30.666 --> 01:14:33.035
MORE. IN PARTICULAR, LATINOS AND

01:14:33.101 --> 01:14:34.203
ESPECIALLY QUEER

01:14:34.269 --> 01:14:34.970
MEXICAN-AMERICANS HAVE ALWAYS

01:14:35.037 --> 01:14:37.172
BEEN PART OF THE LGBT+ HISTORY

01:14:37.239 --> 01:14:38.907
AND THE STRUGGLE. EVEN WHEN OUR

01:14:38.974 --> 01:14:40.609
STORIES WEREN'T TOLD FROM

01:14:40.676 --> 01:14:43.078
ACTIVISTS LIKE SYLVIA RIVERA,

01:14:43.145 --> 01:14:44.980
JOSE SARRIA TO THE COUNTLESS

01:14:45.047 --> 01:14:46.515
UNNAMED QUEER CHICANOS WHO

01:14:46.582 --> 01:14:48.784
RISKED EVERYTHING JUST TO LIVE

01:14:48.851 --> 01:14:50.619
AND LOVE OPENLY, OUR COMMUNITY

01:14:50.686 --> 01:14:52.955
HAS ALWAYS STOOD WITH PRIDE,

01:14:53.021 --> 01:14:55.390
EVEN IN THE FACE OF ERASURE. BUT

01:14:55.457 --> 01:14:57.259
LET'S BE HONEST, THAT YELLOW

01:14:57.326 --> 01:14:59.828
BRICK ROAD WAS PAVED BY RISK, BY

01:14:59.895 --> 01:15:01.163
RESISTANCE, AND BY RELENTLESS

01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:03.065
LOVE. AND TODAY WE FIND

01:15:03.131 --> 01:15:04.933
OURSELVES AT ANOTHER CROSSROADS.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.301
BECAUSE DESPITE THE PROGRESS,

01:15:06.368 --> 01:15:08.337
DESPITE THE SACRIFICE, THE

01:15:08.403 --> 01:15:09.271
ATTACKS ARE BACK AND THEY'RE

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:12.474
COMING IN FAST. THIS FEDERAL

01:15:12.541 --> 01:15:13.775
ADMINISTRATION IS WAGING A FULL

01:15:13.842 --> 01:15:15.777
SCALE CAMPAIGN TO ROLL BACK

01:15:15.844 --> 01:15:18.213
DECADES OF CIVIL RIGHTS GAINS.

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:19.348
LAST WEEK, THEY CANCELED

01:15:19.414 --> 01:15:21.016
MILLIONS IN SUICIDE PREVENTION

01:15:21.083 --> 01:15:23.385
FUNDING FOR LGBTQ PLUS YOUTH.

01:15:23.452 --> 01:15:25.721
LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN THEY ARE

01:15:25.787 --> 01:15:28.323
CUTTING LIFESAVING SUPPORT FOR

01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:30.058
CHILDREN CHILDREN TO SCORE

01:15:30.125 --> 01:15:32.060
POLITICAL POINTS. THIS IS NOT

01:15:32.127 --> 01:15:35.163
POLICY. THIS IS CRUELTY. AND AS

01:15:35.230 --> 01:15:37.065
THEY ATTEMPT TO ERASE THE LGBTQ

01:15:37.132 --> 01:15:38.567
PLUS COMMUNITY UNDER THE GUISE

01:15:38.634 --> 01:15:42.004

ADMINISTRATION'S ATTACKS ON THE

BREAKING THROUGH TO CREATE SPACE

01:17:40.122 --> 01:17:42.024
AND UPLIFT VOICES, EVEN IN THE

01:17:42.090 --> 01:17:43.892
FACE OF TREMENDOUS AND OFTEN

01:17:43.959 --> 01:17:45.594
VIOLENT OPPOSITION. FOLKS LIKE

AND STILL LOVE EACH OTHER UNLESS

01:18:06.681 --> 01:18:08.817
OUR DISAGREEMENT IS ROOTED IN MY

01:18:08.884 --> 01:18:11.053
OPPRESSION AND THE DENIAL OF MY

01:18:11.119 --> 01:18:15.690
HUMANITY AND MY RIGHT TO EXIST.

01:18:15.757 --> 01:18:18.160
ANOTHER IMPORTANT PART OF PRIDE

01:18:18.226 --> 01:18:21.396
IS JOY. JOY IN THE FORM OF

01:18:21.463 --> 01:18:23.398
RESISTANCE. JOY IN THE FACE OF

01:18:23.465 --> 01:18:25.834
INJUSTICE. JOY IS A POWERFUL

01:18:25.901 --> 01:18:28.503
TOOL TO FIGHT OPPRESSION, JOY,

01:18:28.570 --> 01:18:31.239
AND DEFIANCE. PRIDE MONTH IS

01:18:31.306 --> 01:18:32.140
ABOUT THAT JOY. THE CELEBRATION

01:18:32.207 --> 01:18:35.143
AND REMEMBRANCE. IT'S ALSO AN

01:18:35.210 --> 01:18:36.611
OPPORTUNITY FOR VISIBILITY,

01:18:36.678 --> 01:18:38.346
SELF-EXPRESSION, BEING PROUD OF

01:18:38.413 --> 01:18:40.615
WHO YOU ARE TODAY. WE EMBRACE

01:18:40.682 --> 01:18:42.517
THAT JOY AND WE EMBRACE THAT

01:18:42.584 --> 01:18:44.986
PRIDE. WE EMBRACE OUR LESBIAN,

GAY, BISEXUAL, QUEER, AND GENDER

01:18:47.722 --> 01:18:50.058
NONCONFORMING SIBLINGS, AND WE

01:18:50.125 --> 01:18:50.625
UNEQUIVOCALLY STAND WITH OUR

01:18:50.692 --> 01:18:53.562
TRANSGENDER BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

01:18:53.628 --> 01:18:55.597
ON BEHALF OF THE BLACK CAUCUS, I

01:18:55.664 --> 01:18:57.365

01:19:10.278 --> 01:19:13.615
OPPORTUNITY. THAT'S THE BEST I

01:19:13.682 --> 01:19:16.284
CAN SAY ABOUT THIS RESOLUTION. A

01:19:16.351 --> 01:19:18.987
MISSED OPPORTUNITY, THE WORST I

01:19:19.054 --> 01:19:21.656
CAN SAY ABOUT THE RESOLUTION IS

01:19:21.723 --> 01:19:24.359
THAT IT'S INFLAMMATORY. IT IS

01:19:24.426 --> 01:19:29.564
DISHONEST. IT IS DIVISIVE. AND

01:19:29.631 --> 01:19:32.334
IT IS A SHAME. I'VE SAID TIME

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:34.035
AND TIME AGAIN ON THIS FLOOR

01:19:34.102 --> 01:19:35.971
THAT I WILL NEVER VOTE IN FAVOR

01:19:36.037 --> 01:19:37.906
OF ONE OF THESE HONORARY

01:19:37.973 --> 01:19:41.343
RESOLUTIONS IF IT CONTAINS

01:19:41.409 --> 01:19:43.912
DISHONESTY, IF IT DIVIDES US, OR

01:19:43.979 --> 01:19:45.647
IF IT SPEAKS IN A MANNER THAT

01:19:45.714 --> 01:19:49.384
DOES NOT REFLECT THE VIEWS OF MY

01:19:49.451 --> 01:19:52.187
CONSTITUENTS. MY CONSTITUENTS,

01:19:52.254 --> 01:19:54.022
THE CAUCUS. I'M A MEMBER OF THE

01:19:54.089 --> 01:19:56.491
REPUBLICAN CAUCUS AND ALL

01:19:56.558 --> 01:20:00.595
CALIFORNIANS. WE VALUE, WE

01:20:00.662 --> 01:20:03.965
RESPECT, WE AFFIRM OUR LGBT

01:20:04.032 --> 01:20:06.101
COMMUNITY MEMBERS. THAT IS A

01:20:06.168 --> 01:20:07.903
FACT. NOTWITHSTANDING SOME OF

01:20:07.969 --> 01:20:11.206
THE INFLAMMATORY RHETORIC I'VE

01:20:11.273 --> 01:20:13.208
HEARD TO THE CONTRARY. BUT

01:20:13.275 --> 01:20:14.276
THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS RESOLUTION

01:20:14.342 --> 01:20:17.345
DOES. THIS RESOLUTION DOESN'T

01:20:17.412 --> 01:20:20.348
AFFIRM VALUE AND RESPECT THE

01:20:20.415 --> 01:20:23.685
LGBT COMMUNITY. WHAT THIS

01:20:23.752 --> 01:20:27.455
RESOLUTION DOES IS IT GOES MUCH

01:20:27.522 --> 01:20:29.991
FURTHER THAN THAT TO ENDORSE

01:20:30.058 --> 01:20:31.693

WHERE REPUBLICAN POLITICIANS AND

01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:07.555
DEMOCRAT POLITICIANS WILL

FACT THAT THIS RESOLUTION LETS

01:23:10.552 --> 01:23:12.020

01:23:12.087 --> 01:23:13.722
COULD HAVE ACHIEVED A HISTORIC

01:23:13.788 --> 01:23:16.257
VOTE TODAY. IT WILL BE

01:23:16.324 --> 01:23:17.692
MISREPRESENTED THAT REPUBLICANS

01:23:23.565 --> 01:23:24.866
QUOTE, DISAPPEAR LGBT PEOPLE.

01:23:24.933 --> 01:23:27.001
THEY WANT TO ENACT LAWS TO FORCE

01:23:27.068 --> 01:23:28.370
GAYS INTO CONVERSION THERAPY.

01:23:28.436 --> 01:23:31.072
THOSE THESE ARE QUOTES FROM THE

01:23:31.139 --> 01:23:31.906
COMMENTS JUST MADE ON THIS

01:23:31.973 --> 01:23:35.777
FLOOR. THEY'RE ALSO LIES

01:23:35.844 --> 01:23:38.580
DESIGNED TO INSTILL FEAR IN THE

01:23:38.646 --> 01:23:39.748
HEARTS OF LGBT COMMUNITY MEMBERS

01:23:39.814 --> 01:23:41.750
AT A TIME WHEN THIS COUNTRY,

01:23:41.816 --> 01:23:43.518
THIS STATE, WE SHOULD BE

01:23:43.585 --> 01:23:45.286
CELEBRATING WITH PRIDE. REAL

01:23:45.353 --> 01:23:48.556
PRIDE. THE FACT THAT AMERICANS,

01:23:48.623 --> 01:23:53.294
CALIFORNIANS THAT WE'VE ACHIEVED

01:23:53.361 --> 01:23:56.030
THE EMBRACE OF THE LGBT

01:23:56.097 --> 01:23:57.532
COMMUNITY WITHOUT QUESTION. NOW,

01:23:57.599 --> 01:23:58.800
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE'RE

01:23:58.867 --> 01:24:00.902
GOING TO AGREE ON LAWS LIKE

01:24:00.969 --> 01:24:03.571
ENDING GIRLS SPORTS OR TAKING

01:24:03.638 --> 01:24:07.442
AWAY PARENTS RIGHTS, OR HAVING A

01:24:07.509 --> 01:24:10.578
STANDARD THAT A FOSTER PARENT

01:24:10.645 --> 01:24:13.515
HAS TO AGREE TO A SEX CHANGE

01:24:13.581 --> 01:24:14.482
OPERATION, WHICH ARE

01:24:14.549 --> 01:24:16.284
CONTROVERSIAL POSITIONS THAT

01:24:16.351 --> 01:24:18.153
UNFORTUNATELY ARE REFERENCED AND

01:24:18.219 --> 01:24:19.988
IMPLIED IN THIS RESOLUTION. MR.

01:24:20.054 --> 01:24:21.456
DEMAIO, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO

01:24:21.523 --> 01:24:22.957
INTERRUPT YOU ONE MORE TIME, IF

01:24:23.024 --> 01:24:23.858
YOU DON'T MIND, SIR. IF YOU

01:24:23.925 --> 01:24:25.627
WOULDN'T MIND WAITING. MR.

01:24:25.693 --> 01:24:27.061
CLARK, CAN YOU HOLD THIS TIME?

01:24:27.128 --> 01:24:27.796

01:24:27.862 --> 01:24:29.330
AWARE, BUT TOMORROW IS MR.

01:24:43.378 --> 01:24:46.581

01:24:46.648 --> 01:24:49.384
DEMAIO. YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE AND

01:24:49.451 --> 01:24:50.018
FOUR SECONDS REMAINING. MEMBERS,

01:24:50.084 --> 01:24:52.987
YOUR DECORUM. PLEASE. PLEASE

01:24:53.054 --> 01:24:56.558
CONTINUE, MR. DE MAYO. IF ANYONE

01:24:56.624 --> 01:24:58.293
HAD ANY QUESTIONS AS TO WHETHER

01:24:58.359 --> 01:25:00.228
THIS IS POLITICAL THEATER AND

01:25:00.295 --> 01:25:02.197
CIRCUS, ALL YOU HAD TO DO IS

01:25:02.263 --> 01:25:04.399
WATCH THE INTERRUPTIONS FOR

01:25:04.466 --> 01:25:05.266
BIRTHDAYS. NOTWITHSTANDING THE

01:25:05.333 --> 01:25:06.601
FACT THAT WE CELEBRATE YOUR

01:25:06.668 --> 01:25:08.136
BIRTHDAYS. BUT I THINK

01:25:08.203 --> 01:25:09.571
CALIFORNIA VOTERS OF ALL

01:25:09.637 --> 01:25:11.172
STRIPES, DEMOCRAT, REPUBLICAN

01:25:11.239 --> 01:25:13.208
AND IN BETWEEN, UNDERSTAND WHAT

01:25:13.274 --> 01:25:15.343
I'M SAYING TODAY IS TRUE. THIS

01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:17.312
IS NOT ABOUT AFFIRMING THE LGBT

01:25:17.378 --> 01:25:18.413
COMMUNITY. IT'S ABOUT USING THEM

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:20.715
AS A POLITICAL PAWN TO DIVIDE

01:25:20.782 --> 01:25:24.252
US. 30S WHEN YOU HAD AN

01:25:24.319 --> 01:25:25.687
OPPORTUNITY TO UNITE US, YOU

01:25:25.753 --> 01:25:27.889
CHOSE DIVISION. YOU'RE OUT OF

01:25:27.956 --> 01:25:30.258
ORDER, MR. DEMAIO, YOU ARE OUT

01:25:30.325 --> 01:25:34.295
OF ORDER. WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY

01:25:34.362 --> 01:25:36.831
FOR A UNANIMOUS VOTE ON A

01:25:36.898 --> 01:25:37.966
RESOLUTION WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN

01:25:38.032 --> 01:25:40.468
QUITE HISTORIC, QUITE

01:25:40.535 --> 01:25:42.504
REMARKABLE. AND YET THIS

01:25:42.570 --> 01:25:44.739
MAJORITY CHOSE TO TAKE THAT

01:25:44.806 --> 01:25:47.442
CIVIL RIGHTS ACHIEVEMENT AND SET

01:25:47.509 --> 01:25:51.012
IT ASIDE. I WILL BE VOTING NO ON

01:25:51.079 --> 01:25:52.447
THE CONTENTS OF THIS RESOLUTION.

01:25:52.514 --> 01:25:53.414
NOT BECAUSE I DON'T SUPPORT

01:25:53.481 --> 01:25:55.250
PRIDE OR MY OWN COMMUNITY, BUT

01:25:55.316 --> 01:25:58.253
BECAUSE I DO NOT. I DO NOT

01:25:58.319 --> 01:26:00.355
SUPPORT DIVISION. I DO NOT.

01:26:00.421 --> 01:26:01.556
THANK YOU, MR. DEMAIO.

01:26:01.623 --> 01:26:04.792
DISHONESTY. SEEING AND HEARING

01:26:04.859 --> 01:26:06.394
NO FURTHER DEBATE.

01:26:06.461 --> 01:26:07.762
ASSEMBLYMEMBER WARD, YOU MAY

01:26:07.829 --> 01:26:09.130
CLOSE. THANK YOU, MADAM SPEAKER.

01:26:09.197 --> 01:26:12.000
I WANT TO THANK ALL MY

SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITIES. MY

01:26:17.605 --> 01:26:18.506
OPENING REMARKS. IT'S CRITICALLY

01:26:18.573 --> 01:26:19.340
IMPORTANT THAT WE STAND TOGETHER

01:26:19.407 --> 01:26:21.042
AGAINST SO MANY OF THESE

01:26:21.109 --> 01:26:22.010
INJUSTICES. AND TO MY NEIGHBOR

AS WELL, I DO APPRECIATE OUR

01:26:25.547 --> 01:26:27.048
CONVERSATIONS LAST WEEK THAT WE

01:26:27.115 --> 01:26:28.883
HAD TO BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE SOME

01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:30.885
OF THE POINTS OF VIEW THAT YOU

01:26:30.952 --> 01:26:32.954
HAVE ABOUT WHAT SHOULD OR SHOULD

01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:33.755
NOT GO INTO A RESOLUTION THAT

01:26:33.821 --> 01:26:37.091
SAID. WHILE THE AMENDMENTS TODAY

01:26:37.158 --> 01:26:39.193
ARE NOT PART OF THIS RESOLUTION,

01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:40.929
ARE NOT UP FOR DEBATE THAT YOU

01:26:40.995 --> 01:26:42.096
HAVE BROUGHT THEM UP, WE SHOULD

01:26:42.163 --> 01:26:43.498
CHARACTERIZE THEM REALLY IN

01:26:43.565 --> 01:26:45.567
TWOFOLD. ONE, A SERIES OF

01:26:45.633 --> 01:26:47.302
OMISSIONS WHERE YOU SELECTIVELY

01:26:47.368 --> 01:26:49.637
CHOSE TO BE ABLE TO OMIT

01:26:49.704 --> 01:26:51.439
HISTORICAL FACTS THAT GAVIN

01:26:51.506 --> 01:26:53.107
NEWSOM, WHEN HE WAS MAYOR OF THE

01:26:53.174 --> 01:26:54.576
CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN

01:26:54.642 --> 01:26:56.544
FRANCISCO, LED THE WAY TO TURN

01:26:56.611 --> 01:26:58.980
THE TIDE AND BE ABLE TO PUT US

01:26:59.047 --> 01:26:59.514
ON A PATHWAY FOR MARRIAGE

01:26:59.581 --> 01:27:00.748
EQUALITY THAT PRESIDENT BARACK

01:27:00.815 --> 01:27:02.951
OBAMA IN 2012, WHEN HE CAME OUT

01:27:03.017 --> 01:27:03.685
FOR MARRIAGE EQUALITY, WAS ABLE

01:27:03.751 --> 01:27:05.086
TO START TO CHANGE HEARTS AND

01:27:05.153 --> 01:27:07.121
MINDS. THAT WAS ULTIMATELY

01:27:07.188 --> 01:27:08.890
SUCCESSFUL IN THE 2015 SUPREME

01:27:08.957 --> 01:27:10.792
COURT CASE THAT WE ARE NOW ABLE

01:27:10.858 --> 01:27:14.062
TO ENJOY THE OUTCOMES OF THE

01:27:14.128 --> 01:27:15.863
PRESIDENT. JOE BIDEN IN 2021,

01:27:15.930 --> 01:27:17.999
WAS THE FIRST PRESIDENT IN THE

01:27:18.066 --> 01:27:19.067
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY TO

01:27:19.133 --> 01:27:20.835
RECOGNIZE TRANSGENDER DAY OF

01:27:20.902 --> 01:27:24.973
VISIBILITY, AND TWO PAGES WORTH

01:27:25.039 --> 01:27:28.409
OF STRIKE OUT THAT NEARLY

01:27:28.476 --> 01:27:31.379
LITERALLY ERASED WHAT WE ARE

01:27:31.446 --> 01:27:32.747
STRUGGLING FOR. THE CHALLENGES

01:27:32.814 --> 01:27:34.549
OUR COMMUNITY ARE FACING TODAY,

01:27:34.616 --> 01:27:37.552
WHICH ARE REAL. THEY ARE NOT

01:27:37.619 --> 01:27:38.519
INFLAMMATORY. THEY ARE NOT

01:27:38.586 --> 01:27:40.121
DIVISIVE. THEY ARE THE STRUGGLES

01:27:40.188 --> 01:27:41.522
AND THE CHALLENGES THAT WE ARE

01:27:41.589 --> 01:27:42.690
HEARING FROM OUR COMMUNITY

01:27:42.757 --> 01:27:44.492
MEMBERS. AND THEY MUST BE

01:27:44.559 --> 01:27:45.093
MEMORIALIZED BECAUSE THEY ARE

01:27:45.159 --> 01:27:47.161
GOING TO BE OUR PATHWAY TO BREAK

01:27:47.228 --> 01:27:48.463
THROUGH THESE MOMENTS AND TO BE

01:27:48.529 --> 01:27:50.932
ABLE TO CREATE A MORE JUST AND

01:27:50.999 --> 01:27:52.133
EQUAL FUTURE FOR ALL. FOR THOSE

01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:53.368
REASONS, I LOOK FORWARD TO

01:27:53.434 --> 01:27:55.136
