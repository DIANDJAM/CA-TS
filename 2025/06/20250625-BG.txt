00:50:50.781 --> 00:50:52.182
CAN'T IMAGINE DRAFTING THOSE IN

00:50:52.249 --> 00:50:53.717
THE FIRST PLACE. BUT I JUST

00:50:53.784 --> 00:50:55.218
SIMPLY REVIEWING THEM TAKES A

00:50:55.285 --> 00:50:58.221

HEARTS ARE IN THE RIGHT SPOT.

00:51:12.302 --> 00:51:14.171

THE LEGISLATURE AS IDENTIFIED AT

00:51:41.598 --> 00:51:43.366
THE MAY REVISION. CALIFORNIA WAS

00:51:43.433 --> 00:51:45.469
AND CONTINUES TO FACE UNCERTAIN

00:51:45.535 --> 00:51:47.537
ECONOMIC AND FISCAL TIMES. AFTER

00:51:47.604 --> 00:51:49.172
TWO YEARS OF SOLVING FOR

00:51:49.239 --> 00:51:50.907
MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET

00:51:50.974 --> 00:51:51.908
DEFICITS, WE ARE ONCE AGAIN

00:51:51.975 --> 00:51:53.677
DEALING WITH A SITUATION THAT

00:51:53.743 --> 00:51:55.679
REQUIRES ADDITIONAL SOLUTIONS TO

00:51:55.745 --> 00:51:57.481
BALANCE OUR BUDGET. WE HAVE

00:51:57.547 --> 00:51:59.216
PULLED BACK A LOT OF OUR ONE

00:51:59.282 --> 00:52:00.984
TIME INVESTMENTS AS AS WELL AS

00:52:01.051 --> 00:52:01.618
MADE OTHER REDUCTIONS, WITH THE

00:52:01.685 --> 00:52:03.420
GOAL TO MAINTAIN OUR PRIORITY

00:52:03.487 --> 00:52:05.255
INVESTMENTS. PROGRAM COSTS HAVE

00:52:05.322 --> 00:52:06.857
CONTINUED TO OUTPACE REVENUES.

00:52:06.923 --> 00:52:08.091
AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE FACE

00:52:08.158 --> 00:52:09.526
THE THREAT OF SIGNIFICANT

00:52:09.593 --> 00:52:11.061
REDUCTIONS IN FEDERAL SUPPORT,

00:52:11.127 --> 00:52:12.529
AND THEREFORE, WE HAD TO MAKE

00:52:12.596 --> 00:52:13.997
VERY DIFFICULT DECISIONS TO

00:52:14.064 --> 00:52:15.699
BALANCE THIS BUDGET IN THE NEXT

00:52:15.765 --> 00:52:17.234
FISCAL YEAR, AS WELL AS ADDRESS

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:19.302
GROWING COSTS. THE BUDGET

00:52:19.369 --> 00:52:20.737

00:52:20.804 --> 00:52:22.239
ONGOING REDUCTIONS TO SOME OF

00:52:22.305 --> 00:52:23.974
THE COSTLIEST OF OUR STATE

00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:25.342
PROGRAMS. HOWEVER, IT MAINTAINS

00:52:25.408 --> 00:52:26.409
INVESTMENTS TO THE CORE OF OUR

00:52:26.476 --> 00:52:28.245
HEALTH AND SAFETY NET PROGRAMS

00:52:28.311 --> 00:52:29.679
THAT SUPPORT SUPPORT

00:52:29.746 --> 00:52:31.181
CALIFORNIANS THAT NEED THEM THE

00:52:31.248 --> 00:52:32.382
MOST. IT TAKES A BALANCED

00:52:32.449 --> 00:52:33.984
APPROACH, GIVEN THE ECONOMIC

00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:35.785
UNCERTAINTY DRIVEN BY FEDERAL

00:52:35.852 --> 00:52:38.522
POLICIES. WITH THAT, MR. CHAIR,

00:52:38.588 --> 00:52:40.156
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO BEGIN WITH

00:52:40.223 --> 00:52:43.927

SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS. I'LL

01:22:11.226 --> 01:22:12.727
DONE, AND DIFFERENT TRIBAL

01:22:12.794 --> 01:22:15.297
LEADERS CAME IN AND OTHERS ALSO

01:22:15.363 --> 01:22:17.699
WERE NEGOTIATING IN

01:22:17.766 --> 01:22:18.667
NEGOTIATIONS. WE ALWAYS DON'T

01:22:18.733 --> 01:22:21.303
GET EVERYTHING WE WANT, BUT THIS

01:22:21.369 --> 01:22:23.538
IS A GREAT STEP FORWARD. IT DOES

01:22:23.605 --> 01:22:25.573
NOT SOLVE ALL ISSUES, BUT IT IS

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:27.909
A GREAT COMPROMISE THAT ALLOWS

01:22:27.976 --> 01:22:29.911
THE STATE TO MOVE FORWARD, TO

01:22:29.978 --> 01:22:31.713
FULFILL THE STATE'S

01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:32.881
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE

01:22:32.947 --> 01:22:34.249
AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO THOSE IN

01:22:34.316 --> 01:22:36.751
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:22:36.818 --> 01:22:38.853
COMPONENTS AGREED UPON WITH

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:42.524
INPUT FROM TRIBES INCLUDE AREAS

01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:44.826
TO PROTECT AB 52 PROCESS WITH

01:22:44.893 --> 01:22:46.861
SOME ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS.

01:22:46.928 --> 01:22:48.596
WHILE THERE ARE SOME WHO FEEL WE

01:22:48.663 --> 01:22:51.433
DIDN'T GO FAR ENOUGH, WE ALSO

01:22:51.499 --> 01:22:53.335
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE

01:22:53.401 --> 01:22:55.503
NEGOTIATE ISSUES, NEGOTIATION IS

01:22:55.570 --> 01:22:57.605
A PROCESS OF GIVE AND TAKE. AND

01:22:57.672 --> 01:23:00.141
AS A MEMBER, AS A MEMBER OF A

01:23:00.208 --> 01:23:02.010
CALIFORNIA INDIAN TRIBE WHO

01:23:02.077 --> 01:23:04.512
STILL CONDUCTS REBURIALS, WE

01:23:04.579 --> 01:23:05.947
KNOW THAT THAT VOICE IS

01:23:06.014 --> 01:23:07.515
IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR

01:23:07.582 --> 01:23:09.517
VOICES ARE BEING HEARD. WHEN

01:23:09.584 --> 01:23:11.319
FOUR WEEKS AGO, WE WEREN'T EVEN

01:23:11.386 --> 01:23:13.521
ACKNOWLEDGED IN THIS BILL. TODAY

01:23:13.588 --> 01:23:15.657
WE HAVE COMPONENTS THAT MOVED

01:23:15.724 --> 01:23:17.125
FORWARD, AND WE BELIEVE WE

01:23:17.192 --> 01:23:18.960
ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES MOVING

01:23:19.027 --> 01:23:21.429
FORWARD, WHICH WAS ONLY DONE

01:23:21.496 --> 01:23:22.497
WHEN WE ACTUALLY COME TOGETHER

01:23:22.564 --> 01:23:25.400
AND START TO WORK IN AREAS THAT

01:23:25.467 --> 01:23:28.303
WE WORKED ON, INCLUDING IN THIS

01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:30.472
AREA, IN THE OVERVIEWS HAVE

01:23:30.538 --> 01:23:32.006
BINDING CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL

01:23:32.073 --> 01:23:33.608
WHEN THESE PROJECTS MOVE

01:23:33.675 --> 01:23:35.143
FORWARD, WHICH INCLUDE, FOR THE

01:23:35.210 --> 01:23:37.278
FIRST TIME, TRIBAL MONITORING

01:23:37.345 --> 01:23:39.080
THAT WOULD BE PAID BY THE

01:23:39.147 --> 01:23:41.182
DEVELOPER PROJECT, PROJECT

01:23:41.249 --> 01:23:42.784
APPLICANT WOULD PAY FOR THESE

01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:44.319
MONITORING COSTS. AVOIDANCE OF

01:23:44.386 --> 01:23:46.588
TRIBAL CULTURAL RESOURCES WHERE

01:23:46.654 --> 01:23:48.623
FEASIBLE, CULTURAL APPROPRIATE

01:23:48.690 --> 01:23:51.226
TREATMENT AND DOCUMENTATION.

01:23:51.292 --> 01:23:53.061
MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE RECORD

01:23:53.128 --> 01:23:55.397
SEARCH ARE BEING DONE AND TO

01:23:55.463 --> 01:23:56.931
ADHERE TO THE SACRED LANDS

01:23:56.998 --> 01:23:58.500
INVENTORY REQUEST TO THE NATIVE

01:23:58.566 --> 01:24:00.368
AMERICAN HERITAGE COMMISSION.

01:24:00.435 --> 01:24:01.302
COMPLIANCE WITH HEALTH AND

01:24:01.369 --> 01:24:03.671
SAFETY CODE FOR HUMAN REMAINS

01:24:03.738 --> 01:24:06.374
AND REBURIALS. WE STILL CONDUCT

01:24:06.441 --> 01:24:08.576
REBURIALS FOR OUR TRIBE. I DID A

01:24:08.643 --> 01:24:10.044
REBURIAL WHEN WE WERE ON SPRING

01:24:10.111 --> 01:24:11.479
BREAK. SO THESE ARE THINGS THAT

01:24:11.546 --> 01:24:13.715
ARE VERY, VERY CLOSE TO ME AND

01:24:13.782 --> 01:24:16.151
PERSONAL. AND THE APPLICATION OF

01:24:16.217 --> 01:24:18.686
TRIBAL ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE IN

01:24:18.753 --> 01:24:20.789
HABITAT, HABITAT RESTORATION.

01:24:20.855 --> 01:24:22.957
THERE IS A CONSULTATION TIME

01:24:23.024 --> 01:24:24.392
FRAME THAT STARTS TO MOVE

01:24:24.459 --> 01:24:25.560
FORWARD BECAUSE IT IS A

01:24:25.627 --> 01:24:28.263
STREAMLINING COMPONENT. ONE ONCE

01:24:28.329 --> 01:24:30.398
APPROVED FROM THE LOCAL AGENCY,

01:24:30.465 --> 01:24:32.167
THEY HAVE 14 DAYS. THE DEVELOPER

01:24:32.233 --> 01:24:35.236
HAS 14 DAYS TO NOTIFY TRIBES AND

01:24:35.303 --> 01:24:37.772
FORMALLY NOTIFY THEM OF THE

01:24:37.839 --> 01:24:40.241
PROJECT. THE TRIBES THEN HAVE 60

01:24:40.308 --> 01:24:42.310
DAYS TO RESPOND, AND I BELIEVE

01:24:42.377 --> 01:24:44.546
THAT 60 DAYS UP FRONT GIVES US

01:24:44.612 --> 01:24:46.347
ALL A BETTER CHANCE TO NEGOTIATE

01:24:46.414 --> 01:24:48.917
THINGS MOVING FORWARD AND

01:24:48.983 --> 01:24:51.386
INITIATION WITHIN 30 DAYS OF

01:24:51.453 --> 01:24:53.455
CONSULTATION IS REQUESTED, AND

01:24:53.521 --> 01:24:56.057
THEN CONCLUSION OF THOSE

01:24:56.124 --> 01:24:58.326
TREATMENTS WITHIN 45 TO 60 DAYS,

01:24:58.393 --> 01:25:01.095
WHERE THE TRIBE HAS A 15 DAY

01:25:01.162 --> 01:25:04.332
EXTENSION SOLELY ON THEIR PART.

01:25:04.399 --> 01:25:06.568
THESE AREAS. WE BELIEVE THAT IF

01:25:06.634 --> 01:25:08.636
THERE IS ONGOING DISCUSSION, CAN

01:25:08.703 --> 01:25:10.605
MOVE FORWARD AND BE ABLE TO HAVE

01:25:10.672 --> 01:25:13.374
THE VOICES MOVING FORWARD. THESE

01:25:13.441 --> 01:25:14.776
AREAS ARE THINGS THAT WE WORKED

01:25:14.843 --> 01:25:16.945
ON. WELL, SOME MIGHT SAY IT

01:25:17.011 --> 01:25:19.447
DIDN'T GO FAR ENOUGH. WE DO HAVE

01:25:19.514 --> 01:25:22.417
SUPPORT FROM THOSE THROUGHOUT

01:25:22.484 --> 01:25:24.519
TRIBAL COMMUNITIES. TRIBAL

01:25:24.586 --> 01:25:26.020
SUPPORT THAT'S THERE THAT

01:25:26.087 --> 01:25:27.555
INCLUDE LETTERS OF SUPPORT FROM

01:25:27.622 --> 01:25:29.290
THE YUROK TRIBE, THE LARGEST

01:25:29.357 --> 01:25:31.025
TRIBE IN THE STATE OF

01:25:31.092 --> 01:25:32.727
CALIFORNIA. TABLE MOUNTAIN

01:25:32.794 --> 01:25:35.363
RANCHERIA, TULE RIVER INDIAN

01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:38.933
TRIBE OF CALIFORNIA, THE

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.268

01:25:56.451 --> 01:25:57.919
THERE IS ONGOING SUPPORT FOR THE

01:25:57.986 --> 01:26:00.488
THINGS THAT WE CAME TOGETHER ON.

01:26:00.555 --> 01:26:02.957
AGAIN, THERE WAS NO MENTION OF

01:26:03.024 --> 01:26:04.659
PROTECTION OF RESOURCES FOR

01:26:04.726 --> 01:26:06.528
WEEKS AGO, BUT TODAY WE REACHED

01:26:06.594 --> 01:26:08.463
A COMPROMISE. DOES IT DO

01:26:08.530 --> 01:26:10.298
EVERYTHING THAT WE WANT IN

01:26:10.365 --> 01:26:12.333
COMPROMISE AND NEGOTIATION? NO

01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:14.636
ONE EVER GETS 100%, BUT I

01:26:14.702 --> 01:26:17.005
BELIEVE IT IS A STEP IN THE

01:26:17.071 --> 01:26:18.106
RIGHT DIRECTION TO PRESERVE

01:26:18.172 --> 01:26:19.274
CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLE AND TO

01:26:19.340 --> 01:26:21.543
MAKE SURE THAT MONITORS ARE PAID

01:26:21.609 --> 01:26:23.344
FOR BY THE DEVELOPERS TO ENSURE

01:26:23.411 --> 01:26:24.746
THAT INADVERTENT DISCOVERY OF

01:26:24.812 --> 01:26:27.448
HUMAN REMAINS. THERE'S A PROCESS

01:26:27.515 --> 01:26:30.785
FOR REBURIAL. THANK YOU, THANK

01:27:27.175 --> 01:27:30.345
POINT IS THAT THEY WORK HOUR

AFTER HOUR TRYING TO TAKE IN

01:27:32.146 --> 01:27:35.083

ADMINISTRATION, AND WE ARE, AS

01:27:43.391 --> 01:27:45.860
WAS NOTED BY MY COLLEAGUE, WE

01:27:45.927 --> 01:27:47.295
DON'T GET EVERYTHING WE WANT IN

01:27:47.362 --> 01:27:49.797
A BUDGET AND WE FIGHT FOR MUCH.

01:27:49.864 --> 01:27:52.300
AND WITH THAT, WE ARE CERTAINLY

01:27:52.367 --> 01:27:55.536
HAPPY TO HAVE MOVED THE NEEDLE

01:27:55.603 --> 01:27:57.271
ON HOUSING AND HOMELESS DOLLARS

01:27:57.338 --> 01:27:59.641
THIS YEAR, WHERE WE STARTED OUT

01:27:59.707 --> 01:28:03.077
WITH A00 DOLLARS PUT INTO

01:28:03.144 --> 01:28:06.014
HOUSING, AND WE HIGHLY DISAGREED

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:10.418
WITH THAT INITIAL NUMBER AND ARE

01:28:10.485 --> 01:28:13.154
PLEASED TO SEE OVER A BILLION

01:28:13.221 --> 01:28:15.690
AND A HALF DOLLARS PUT BACK INTO

01:28:15.757 --> 01:28:17.992
HOUSING, INCLUDING FUNDING FOR

01:28:18.059 --> 01:28:20.028
THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX

01:28:20.094 --> 01:28:21.896
CREDIT, FUNDING FOR THE

01:28:21.963 --> 01:28:25.466

01:28:25.533 --> 01:28:29.404
DOLLARS INCLUDED IN THE 2026

01:28:29.470 --> 01:28:30.838
BUDGET. WE KNOW THAT THERE'S

01:28:30.905 --> 01:28:33.741
STILL A LOT OF WORK TO DO. EVERY

01:28:33.808 --> 01:28:35.843
POLL OUT THERE SHOWS

01:28:35.910 --> 01:28:38.346
CALIFORNIANS SAYING HOUSING IS

01:28:38.413 --> 01:28:42.450
JUST TOO DARN HIGH, AND THIS IS

01:28:42.517 --> 01:28:45.953
TAKING A MAJORITY OF THEIR OWN

01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:48.322
BUDGETS. AND SO WE MUST BUILD.

01:28:48.389 --> 01:28:49.991
WE MUST BUILD FASTER. THERE'S

01:28:50.058 --> 01:28:52.093
NOT ALWAYS AGREEMENT ON EVERY

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:55.730
PIECE OF LANGUAGE, BUT CERTAINLY

01:28:55.797 --> 01:28:58.199
WE KNOW THAT ACROSS THE

01:28:58.266 --> 01:29:00.401
SPECTRUM, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

01:29:00.468 --> 01:29:02.203
AFFORDABILITY, CALIFORNIA

01:29:02.270 --> 01:29:03.471
CALIFORNIANS ARE SAYING WE WANT

01:29:03.538 --> 01:29:05.440
TO STAY HERE, WE WANT TO WORK

01:29:05.506 --> 01:29:07.642
HERE, BUT WE NEED HOUSING AND WE

01:29:07.709 --> 01:29:09.811
NEED IT FASTER. SO WE ARE

01:29:09.877 --> 01:29:13.381
PLEASED WITH THE MOVEMENT ON

01:29:13.448 --> 01:29:14.816
STREAMLINING. WE KNOW THERE'S

01:29:14.882 --> 01:29:16.250
NOT ALWAYS AGREEMENT THERE, BUT

01:29:16.317 --> 01:29:18.853
WE CERTAINLY WANT TO SEE HOUSING

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:23.057
BUILT AT A QUICKER PACE. WITH

01:29:23.124 --> 01:29:25.426
THAT, IT WAS ALSO MENTIONED WE

01:29:25.493 --> 01:29:28.096
WERE ABLE TO FINALLY MAKE SOME

01:29:28.162 --> 01:29:31.799
RELIEF FOR RETIRED VETERANS TO

01:29:31.866 --> 01:29:34.502
GET SOME TYPE OF RESPONSE FOR

01:29:34.569 --> 01:29:36.104
THE RETIREMENT. WE KNOW THAT

01:29:36.170 --> 01:29:38.539
THEY SERVE. WE HAVE BIG BASES

01:29:38.606 --> 01:29:40.842
HERE WITH PENDLETON, AND WE WANT

01:29:40.908 --> 01:29:42.543
THEM TO STAY IN CALIFORNIA. SO

01:29:42.610 --> 01:29:44.746
WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE PROGRESS

01:29:44.812 --> 01:29:48.850
THERE. ANOTHER MAJOR AREA THAT

01:29:48.916 --> 01:29:50.752
WE'VE MADE SOME PROGRESS WE WANT

01:29:50.818 --> 01:29:53.321
TO SEE MORE PROGRESS IS ON

01:29:53.387 --> 01:29:55.123
CANNABIS. EARLY ON IN OUR BUDGET

01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:57.325
COMMITTEE, WE HAD INFORMATIONAL

01:29:57.391 --> 01:29:59.093
HEARINGS THAT TALKED ABOUT THE

01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:01.362
STATE OF CANNABIS. AND SOME OF

01:30:01.429 --> 01:30:03.765
YOU MAY NOT FOLLOW IT, BUT

01:30:03.831 --> 01:30:05.600
CERTAINLY WE THERE WAS

01:30:05.666 --> 01:30:07.401
PREDICTIONS THAT WE WOULD HAVE

01:30:07.468 --> 01:30:09.103
MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS COMING

01:30:09.170 --> 01:30:10.972
IN THE STATE THAT, IN FACT HAS

01:30:11.038 --> 01:30:14.175
NOT HAPPENED. AND WE KNOW THAT

01:30:14.242 --> 01:30:15.777
FROM THE PANDEMIC LEVELS WHERE

01:30:15.843 --> 01:30:17.512
THERE WAS MUCH HIGHER USE, AS

01:30:17.578 --> 01:30:19.747
YOU CAN IMAGINE, IT HAS DROPPED

01:30:19.814 --> 01:30:21.682
OFF SIGNIFICANTLY. BUT THE

01:30:21.749 --> 01:30:24.252
PROGRESS THAT WE HAVE MADE IS

01:30:24.318 --> 01:30:26.587
ENFORCEMENT, AND WE WANT TO SEE

01:30:26.654 --> 01:30:28.956
THIS ENFORCEMENT SO THAT THE

01:30:29.023 --> 01:30:32.226
LEGAL CANNABIS OWNERS CAN HAVE

01:30:32.293 --> 01:30:34.395
SOME SUCCESS. WE STILL HAVE WORK

01:30:34.462 --> 01:30:37.999
TO DO ON THAT, BUT WE CERTAINLY

01:30:38.065 --> 01:30:41.135
ARE PLEASED WITH THAT OUTCOME.

01:30:41.202 --> 01:30:43.004
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU MAY

01:30:43.070 --> 01:30:44.972
NOT KNOW AS BUDGET SUB CHAIRS IS

01:30:45.039 --> 01:30:47.375
NOT ONLY DO WE WORK IN OUR OWN

01:30:47.441 --> 01:30:49.377
SUB CHAIR, BUT WE ALSO WORK WITH

01:30:49.443 --> 01:30:52.380
THE OTHER SUB CHAIRS, NOT ONLY

01:30:52.446 --> 01:30:54.448
HAVING REGULAR MEETINGS, BUT

01:30:54.515 --> 01:30:57.018
ALSO GOING TO THEM AND TALKING

01:30:57.084 --> 01:30:58.886
ABOUT OUR PRIORITIES. AND SO I'M

01:30:58.953 --> 01:31:02.423
PLEASED TO SEE THE WORK UNDER

01:31:02.490 --> 01:31:04.592
PUBLIC SAFETY. WE THANK THE

01:31:04.659 --> 01:31:08.729
BUDGET CHAIR FOR LISTENING TO

01:31:08.796 --> 01:31:11.866
THE WOMEN, THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS,

01:31:11.933 --> 01:31:13.634
WHO SAID THAT WOMEN

01:31:13.701 --> 01:31:15.837
INCARCERATION ARE AN AREA THAT

01:31:15.903 --> 01:31:18.039
WE WANT TO BE VERY INTENTIONAL

01:31:18.105 --> 01:31:20.675
ABOUT, AND WE ARE PLEASED THAT

01:31:20.741 --> 01:31:24.011
HE DID A HOSTED A INFORMATIONAL

01:31:24.078 --> 01:31:25.513
HEARING. AND NOW THERE ARE

01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:28.015
DOLLARS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE

01:31:28.082 --> 01:31:30.284
PENDING ISSUES IN OUR TWO

01:31:30.351 --> 01:31:32.286
CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S PRISON,

01:31:32.353 --> 01:31:34.088
PARTICULARLY AROUND SEXUAL

01:31:34.155 --> 01:31:36.657
ASSAULT. AS WE KNOW, THAT IS

01:31:36.724 --> 01:31:39.493
ABSOLUTELY NOT ACCEPTABLE. IN

01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:43.231
ADDITION, WE I PERSONALLY, AS AN

01:31:43.297 --> 01:31:45.700
EDUCATOR FOR ALMOST 30 YEARS,

01:31:45.766 --> 01:31:47.401
I'M VERY HAPPY TO SEE SOME

01:31:47.468 --> 01:31:49.837
PROGRESS ON THE COLA FOR CHILD

01:31:49.904 --> 01:31:52.874
CARE. WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE WORK

01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:56.944
TO DO ON THE CHILD CARE SLOTS,

01:31:57.011 --> 01:31:59.313
BUT CERTAINLY THE COLA IS

01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:01.849
SOMETHING THAT THAT OUR CHILD

01:32:01.916 --> 01:32:04.085
CARE PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN ASKING

01:32:04.151 --> 01:32:08.022
FOR. AND THIS IS IMPORTANT AS WE

01:32:08.089 --> 01:32:10.424
KNOW THAT IN ORDER TO SUSTAIN

01:32:10.491 --> 01:32:12.627
CALIFORNIA AS THE FOURTH LARGEST

01:32:12.693 --> 01:32:15.196
ECONOMY, WE NEED TO HAVE GOOD,

01:32:15.263 --> 01:32:18.466
SAFE CHILD CARE. BUT WITH THAT,

01:32:18.532 --> 01:32:20.968
AGAIN, I'M PLEASED TO HAVE THIS

01:32:21.035 --> 01:32:22.737
OPPORTUNITY TO ROLL AND ROLL, TO

01:32:22.803 --> 01:32:26.040
WORK UNDER SOME VERY INVESTED

01:32:26.107 --> 01:32:27.275
SUB CHAIRS AND OF COURSE, UNDER

01:32:27.341 --> 01:32:30.945

HANDLING SOME VERY TOUGH ISSUES

01:32:38.753 --> 01:32:39.654
THIS YEAR. I THINK IT'S BEEN

01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:41.122
CLEAR TO ANYONE WHO'S BEEN

01:32:41.188 --> 01:32:42.523
WATCHING OUR BUDGET PROCESS OVER

01:32:42.590 --> 01:32:44.692
THE LAST TWO YEARS THAT HOUSING

01:32:44.759 --> 01:32:45.293
AND HOMELESSNESS AND MAKING

01:32:45.359 --> 01:32:46.360
PROGRESS ON THOSE ISSUES ARE A

01:32:46.427 --> 01:32:48.396
TOP PRIORITY FOR THE ASSEMBLY.

01:32:48.462 --> 01:32:49.063
YOU HAVE REALLY BEEN OUR LEADER

01:32:49.130 --> 01:32:50.464
AND OUR CHAMPION IN THAT

01:32:50.531 --> 01:32:52.833
RESPECT. AND AS I HAVE TOLD YOU

01:32:54.669 --> 01:32:57.305
THE WORK TO MOVE US IN, IN A IN

01:32:57.371 --> 01:32:58.940
A BETTER DIRECTION ON HOUSING,

01:32:59.006 --> 01:32:59.607
AND PARTICULARLY THE FUNDING FOR

01:32:59.674 --> 01:33:01.309
SOME REALLY CRITICAL AFFORDABLE

01:33:01.375 --> 01:33:02.243
HOUSING PROGRAMS TO MAKE SURE

01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:04.278
THAT WE MAKE PROGRESS ON THAT.

01:33:04.345 --> 01:33:06.614
SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR GOOD WORK

01:33:06.681 --> 01:33:08.049
THERE, AND ALSO FOR YOUR

01:33:08.115 --> 01:33:08.983
COLLABORATION WITH THE OTHER SUB

01:33:09.050 --> 01:33:10.318
CHAIRS. WITH THAT NEXT ON MY

01:33:10.384 --> 01:33:12.219
LIST, I HAVE MR. LEE. THANK YOU,

01:33:12.286 --> 01:33:14.221
MR. CHAIR. I HAVE A QUICK

01:33:14.288 --> 01:33:16.490
COMMENTS AND THEN I HAVE TWO

01:33:16.557 --> 01:33:17.391
QUESTIONS ON TWO DIFFERENT TOPIC

01:33:17.458 --> 01:33:19.727
AREAS. SO BE PREPARED. DOV. SO I

01:33:19.794 --> 01:33:21.028
JUST WANT TO THANK OF COURSE,

OUR BUDGET TEAM SO MUCH FOR YOUR

CONSTANT ROUND THE CLOCK WORK,

01:33:24.365 --> 01:33:26.300
AS WELL AS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

01:33:26.367 --> 01:33:27.368
AND SUPPORTING GETTING THE THREE

01:33:27.435 --> 01:33:28.970
PARTY AGREEMENT. SO TO OUR

01:33:29.036 --> 01:33:30.304
BUDGET SUB CHAIRS AND OUR BUDGET

01:33:30.371 --> 01:33:32.306
CHAIR FOR THE ABLE LEADERSHIP, I

01:33:32.373 --> 01:33:33.274
AM VERY PLEASED TO SEE THAT THE

01:33:33.341 --> 01:33:34.475
WRITE GRANTS AND THE HIGHER

01:33:34.542 --> 01:33:36.444
PROGRAM AND THE FUNDING FOR

01:33:36.510 --> 01:33:37.078
INCARCERATED FIREFIGHTERS MADE

01:33:37.144 --> 01:33:38.212
IT INTO THE THREE PARTY

01:33:38.279 --> 01:33:39.146
AGREEMENT, WHICH WAS A BIG

01:33:39.213 --> 01:33:40.114
PRIORITY FOR THE LEGISLATIVE

01:33:40.181 --> 01:33:41.682
PROGRESSIVE CAUCUS IN MAKING

01:33:41.749 --> 01:33:43.017
SURE THAT WE ARE SUPPORTING

01:33:43.084 --> 01:33:43.684
FOLKS LEAVING THE CARCERAL

01:33:43.751 --> 01:33:44.919
SYSTEM AND REINTEGRATING INTO

01:33:44.986 --> 01:33:45.786
SOCIETY TO BECOME PRODUCTIVE

01:33:45.853 --> 01:33:47.355
MEMBERS OF SOCIETY. IT'S REALLY

01:33:47.421 --> 01:33:48.556
IMPORTANT THAT THOSE FUNDING,

01:33:48.622 --> 01:33:50.191
WHILE RELATIVELY SMALL IN THE

01:33:50.257 --> 01:33:52.026
BUDGET, WAS ABLE TO SUPPORT

01:33:52.093 --> 01:33:53.427
FOLKS THAT PRODUCTIVE LIVES

01:33:53.494 --> 01:33:54.996
LEAVING OUR CARCERAL SYSTEM. SO

01:33:55.062 --> 01:33:56.998
I'M REALLY PLEASED TO SEE,

01:33:57.064 --> 01:33:58.265
OVERALL THE MOVEMENT WE HAVE IN

01:33:58.332 --> 01:34:00.334
THE BUDGET. I DO HAVE TWO

01:34:00.401 --> 01:34:02.103
QUESTIONS. MY FIRST ONE IS ABOUT

01:34:02.169 --> 01:34:05.306
AB ONE SB, AB 130 ON THE HOUSING

01:34:05.373 --> 01:34:07.875
BOND HOUSING MEASURE, WHICH I

01:34:07.942 --> 01:34:09.410
BROADLY OVERALL HAVE BEEN VERY

01:34:09.477 --> 01:34:10.378
SUPPORTIVE OF ALL THE POLICY

01:34:10.444 --> 01:34:12.580
MEASURES PUT IN THERE. IT IS THE

01:34:12.646 --> 01:34:14.415
FIRST TIME I'VE EVER SEEN THE

01:34:14.482 --> 01:34:16.050
ENTIRE BUDGET BILL CONTINGENT ON

01:34:16.117 --> 01:34:17.818
BEING ENACTED ON TWO POLICY

01:34:17.885 --> 01:34:19.420
BILLS ABOUT HOUSING, BUT IT

01:34:19.487 --> 01:34:21.188
SHOWS HOW SERIOUS IT IS WE ARE

01:34:21.255 --> 01:34:22.723
ABOUT GETTING MORE HOUSING BUILT

01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:24.091
AND HOW DIRE THE HOUSING CRISIS

01:34:24.158 --> 01:34:25.893
IS. HOWEVER, I DID NOTICE WHILE

01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:27.061
AGAIN, I'M REITERATING THAT I'M

01:34:27.128 --> 01:34:28.396
VERY BROADLY SUPPORTIVE OF MOST

01:34:28.462 --> 01:34:30.364
OF THE THINGS IN THERE, AND I AM

01:34:30.431 --> 01:34:32.099
COAUTHOR ON SEVERAL OF THESE

01:34:32.166 --> 01:34:33.167
BILLS. I NOTICED THAT THERE ARE

01:34:33.234 --> 01:34:35.936
NEW CONSTRUCTION MINIMUM WAGE

01:34:36.003 --> 01:34:37.371
STANDARDS PUT IN THERE THAT I

01:34:37.438 --> 01:34:39.607
HAVE NOT SEEN BEFOREHAND, AND I

01:34:39.673 --> 01:34:41.308
NOTICED THAT MY COUNTIES ARE THE

01:34:41.375 --> 01:34:43.144
HIGHEST MINIMUM WAGE, WHICH IS

01:34:43.210 --> 01:34:44.912
GOOD IN THAT REGARD. BUT I

01:34:44.979 --> 01:34:46.047
WANTED TO UNDERSTAND THE

01:34:46.113 --> 01:34:48.282
RATIONALE FOR CREATING Ã UNDER

01:34:48.349 --> 01:34:50.651
THE GUISE OF THIS SEQUA

01:34:50.718 --> 01:34:51.786
STREAMLINING MEASURE. WHAT IS

01:34:51.852 --> 01:34:53.654
MINIMUM WAGE RATIONALE IS HOW

01:34:53.721 --> 01:34:55.156
MUCH DOES IT DEVIATE FROM WHAT

01:34:55.222 --> 01:34:56.557
THE WAGES ARE. I JUST DON'T

01:34:56.624 --> 01:34:58.959
UNDERSTAND WHERE THE 60% AND

01:34:59.026 --> 01:35:00.094
BREAKING IT BY COUNTIES COMES

01:35:00.161 --> 01:35:01.362
FROM, AND WHAT THE LOGIC AND

01:35:01.429 --> 01:35:03.697
RATIONALE THAT IS. SO IF I CAN

01:35:03.764 --> 01:35:05.066
ASK YOU TO EXPLAIN THAT

01:35:05.132 --> 01:35:06.934
RATIONALE FOR US SO I CAN BETTER

01:35:07.001 --> 01:35:09.470
UNDERSTAND. YES. THANK YOU.

01:35:09.537 --> 01:35:10.838
ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEGAN TOKUNAGA

01:35:10.905 --> 01:35:13.107
EBCLC DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE

01:35:13.174 --> 01:35:14.842
WAGE RATES THAT YOU'RE REFERRING

01:35:14.909 --> 01:35:18.846
TO ARE RELATED TO A NEW SEQUA

01:35:18.913 --> 01:35:20.147
STREAMLINING OPTION. SO THESE

01:35:20.214 --> 01:35:21.849
ARE FOR MARKET RATE DEVELOPMENTS

01:35:21.916 --> 01:35:23.184
THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY PAYING

01:35:23.250 --> 01:35:24.952
PREVAILING WAGES. OTHERWISE, IT

01:35:25.019 --> 01:35:26.654
CREATES AN OPTION FOR DEVELOPERS

01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:29.990
TO USE AND GO THROUGH CEQA

01:35:30.057 --> 01:35:30.925
STREAMLINING. AND SO THESE

01:35:30.991 --> 01:35:32.526
PROJECTS WOULD OTHERWISE BE

01:35:32.593 --> 01:35:35.296
PAYING SET MARKET RATES. AND THE

01:35:35.362 --> 01:35:37.198
RATES THAT YOU REFER TO ARE

01:35:37.264 --> 01:35:39.133
HIGHER THAN THE MARKET WOULD PAY

01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:40.267
OTHERWISE. IF A PROJECT IS

01:35:40.334 --> 01:35:41.135
ALREADY REQUIRED TO PAY

01:35:41.202 --> 01:35:42.603
PREVAILING WAGES, THIS NEW

01:35:42.670 --> 01:35:44.038
PROPOSAL DOES NOT EXEMPT THEM

01:35:44.105 --> 01:35:46.140
FROM THOSE EXISTING WAGE

01:35:46.207 --> 01:35:47.241
REQUIREMENTS. SORRY, CAN YOU

01:35:47.308 --> 01:35:48.609
REPEAT THAT LAST PART? WHAT YOU

01:35:48.676 --> 01:35:50.277
WHAT YOU JUST SAID? IF A PROJECT

01:35:50.344 --> 01:35:51.612
IS ALREADY REQUIRED TO PAY

01:35:51.679 --> 01:35:52.713
PREVAILING WAGES, THE PROPOSAL

01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:54.615
BEFORE YOU DOES NOT EXEMPT THEM

01:35:54.682 --> 01:35:55.216
FROM THOSE EXISTING

01:35:55.282 --> 01:35:57.985
REQUIREMENTS. OKAY. BUT CAN YOU

01:35:58.052 --> 01:35:59.420
ALSO EXPLAIN? I JUST DON'T

01:35:59.487 --> 01:36:01.622
UNDERSTAND THE 60% RATIONALE. SO

01:36:01.689 --> 01:36:02.723
IF THESE ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF

01:36:02.790 --> 01:36:04.225
PROJECTS, WHERE DOES THE NUMBER

01:36:04.291 --> 01:36:05.659
COME FROM FOR THE COUNTIES AND

01:36:05.726 --> 01:36:07.628
WHY IS IT LIKE 60% OF THE

01:36:07.695 --> 01:36:09.263
WORKFORCE IS JUST THIS IS ALL

01:36:09.330 --> 01:36:11.031
VERY NEW POLICY TO ME. SURE. SO

01:36:11.098 --> 01:36:12.399
THE INTENT WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:36:12.466 --> 01:36:14.602
THE WAGES THAT ARE SET ARE

01:36:14.668 --> 01:36:16.036
HIGHER THAN MARKET RATES. AND SO

01:36:16.103 --> 01:36:18.139
THERE'S TWO THRESHOLDS AS PART

01:36:18.205 --> 01:36:20.641
OF THE BILL. FIRST IS A 60%. AND

01:36:20.708 --> 01:36:23.944
THEN SO THE REQUIREMENT FOR THE

01:36:24.011 --> 01:36:25.713
HIGHEST WAGE COUNTIES IS THAT

01:36:25.779 --> 01:36:26.881
60% OF THE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS

01:36:26.947 --> 01:36:29.083
WILL BE PAID A RATE OF NO LESS

01:36:29.150 --> 01:36:31.218
THAN $40 PER HOUR. AND THAT 100%

01:36:31.285 --> 01:36:32.987
OF THE WORKERS WOULD BE PAID A

01:36:33.053 --> 01:36:34.722
RATE OF $27 PER HOUR. AND THEN

01:36:34.788 --> 01:36:35.589
THERE'S A TIERING SYSTEM FOR

01:36:35.656 --> 01:36:37.758
OTHER COUNTIES THAT ARE NOT THE

01:36:37.825 --> 01:36:39.026
HIGHEST LEVEL. AND THEN THERE'S

01:36:39.093 --> 01:36:40.895
THREE TIERS OVERALL. RIGHT. AND

01:36:40.961 --> 01:36:43.097
I UNDERSTAND THAT IS THE $40

01:36:43.164 --> 01:36:45.232
RATE FOR MY COUNTIES THAT I LIVE

01:36:45.299 --> 01:36:47.168
IN AND I REPRESENT AS WELL. IF I

01:36:47.234 --> 01:36:48.202
WOULD JUST APPRECIATE OFFLINE TO

01:36:48.269 --> 01:36:49.370
JUST GETTING MORE INFORMATION

01:36:49.436 --> 01:36:52.072
ABOUT THIS LOGIC BEHIND THIS

01:36:52.139 --> 01:36:53.908
POLICY RATIONALE. AND SO BETTER

01:36:53.974 --> 01:36:55.543
UNDERSTAND THAT. SO THAT WOULD

01:36:55.609 --> 01:36:56.911
BE REALLY APPRECIATED. BUT IT IS

01:36:56.977 --> 01:36:58.345
SURPRISING TO ME TO SEE IN THE

01:36:58.412 --> 01:36:59.647
BILL LANGUAGE, BECAUSE IT WASN'T

01:36:59.713 --> 01:37:01.415
PRESENT IN OTHER HOUSING BILLS

01:37:01.482 --> 01:37:02.983
THAT I HAD PREVIOUSLY VOTED FOR.

01:37:03.050 --> 01:37:04.985
THE SECOND THING I WANTED TO ASK

01:37:05.052 --> 01:37:06.787
ABOUT MOVING ON TO A DIFFERENT

01:37:06.854 --> 01:37:08.656
TOPIC ALTOGETHER IS THE FILM TAX

01:37:08.722 --> 01:37:09.356
CREDIT. SO NOW THAT WE ARE, AS I

01:37:09.423 --> 01:37:11.058
UNDERSTAND IT, FOR THE FILM TAX

01:37:11.125 --> 01:37:12.493
CREDIT 4.0, ARE WE DOUBLING IT

01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:14.695
FROM WHAT WE HAD IN THE PREVIOUS

01:37:14.762 --> 01:37:19.099
PROPOSAL FROM 330 EVERY YEAR TO

01:37:19.166 --> 01:37:21.769
770, OR IS THAT THE AGREEMENT

01:37:21.835 --> 01:37:22.836
FROM BEFORE THAT WE WERE GOING

01:37:22.903 --> 01:37:27.408
TO GO TO 770. JACOB KERN

01:37:27.474 --> 01:37:30.911
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SO IN THE

01:37:30.978 --> 01:37:34.148
2023 BUDGET ACT, THE PROGRAM 4.0

01:37:34.215 --> 01:37:38.919
WAS ESTABLISHED TO RUN FROM 2526

01:37:38.986 --> 01:37:42.389
TO 2930 AT $330 MILLION A YEAR.

01:37:42.456 --> 01:37:43.591
THIS PROPOSAL IN THE BUDGET IS

01:37:43.657 --> 01:37:47.194
JUST TO INCREASE THAT 330

01:37:47.261 --> 01:37:48.495
MILLION TO 750 MILLION FOR THOSE

01:37:48.562 --> 01:37:50.831
FIVE YEARS. THE PROGRAM 4.0 IS

01:37:50.898 --> 01:37:52.533
IN EFFECT, OKAY. AND OVER THE

01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:54.335
TIME OF THE. SO WE'RE NOT

01:37:54.401 --> 01:37:55.536
CHANGING THE TIME IN WHICH 4.0

01:37:55.603 --> 01:37:56.604
IS DURATION. SO IT'D STILL

01:37:56.670 --> 01:37:58.672
TECHNICALLY EXPIRE IN THE 2030.

01:37:58.739 --> 01:37:59.573
CORRECT. THAT'S RIGHT. YEAH. SO

01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:01.175
OVER THAT TIME PERIOD NOW WITH

01:38:01.242 --> 01:38:02.476
THE NEW NUMBER, HOW MUCH WOULD

01:38:02.543 --> 01:38:06.647
THAT COST? CALIFORNIA. SO WITHIN

01:38:06.714 --> 01:38:11.252
THE BUDGET WINDOW IT'S SCORED AT

01:38:11.318 --> 01:38:14.888
LESS THAN 20 MILLION. THERE IS

01:38:14.955 --> 01:38:18.592
THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY THERE'S 20

01:38:18.659 --> 01:38:19.693
MILLION OR 20 BILLION,

01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:21.395
20,000,000 MILLION OKAY. BECAUSE

01:38:21.462 --> 01:38:24.131
THE FISCAL IMPACT IS DELAYED.

01:38:24.198 --> 01:38:27.134
YOU'VE GOT ROUNDS OF AWARDS

01:38:27.201 --> 01:38:28.669
GIVEN OUT. AND THEN THOSE AWARDS

01:38:28.736 --> 01:38:30.571
TAKE SOME AMOUNT OF TIME FOR THE

01:38:30.638 --> 01:38:32.439
PRODUCTION TO HAPPEN, FOR THE

01:38:32.506 --> 01:38:33.507
AWARD TO GET CERTIFIED. AND THEN

01:38:33.574 --> 01:38:36.043
THERE'S OFTEN A DELAY AFTER THAT

01:38:36.110 --> 01:38:37.945
AS WELL, IN TERMS OF WHEN THE

01:38:38.012 --> 01:38:39.246
PRODUCTION COMPANY CAN ACTUALLY

01:38:39.313 --> 01:38:42.983
CLAIM THE AWARD, BUT THE TOTAL

01:38:43.050 --> 01:38:44.718
COST OVER THE COURSE OF THE

01:38:44.785 --> 01:38:47.588
PROGRAM WOULD BE ABOUT 2 BILLION

01:38:47.655 --> 01:38:50.090
IN ADDITIONAL COST. FROM THIS

01:38:50.157 --> 01:38:53.294
INCREASE, FROM 330 TO 752

01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:55.195
BILLION OVER THE DURATION UNTIL

01:38:55.262 --> 01:38:56.463
THE END OF THIS DECADE,

01:38:56.530 --> 01:38:59.667
BASICALLY, YEAH, TECHNICALLY

01:38:59.733 --> 01:39:01.302
THERE ARE SOME SMALL COSTS OUT

01:39:01.368 --> 01:39:03.804
INTO THE 2040S, BUT THE MAJORITY

01:39:03.871 --> 01:39:07.675
OF THE COSTS ARE WITHIN THE NEXT

01:39:07.741 --> 01:39:09.543
TEN YEARS. THE YEARS OF HIGHEST

01:39:09.610 --> 01:39:15.783
COST ARE 28, 29, 29, 30, 30, 31

01:39:15.849 --> 01:39:20.354
AND THEN 31, 32. AND IT'S ABOUT

01:39:20.421 --> 01:39:21.889
250 MILLION IN THOSE YEARS.

01:39:21.955 --> 01:39:23.357
OKAY. I DON'T KNOW IF OUR

01:39:23.424 --> 01:39:25.159
THROUGH THE CHAIR IF OUR BUDGET

01:39:25.225 --> 01:39:26.193
STAFF WANTED TO COMMENT I DON'T

01:39:26.260 --> 01:39:28.329
KNOW IF. NO NO COMMENT. OKAY. I

01:39:28.395 --> 01:39:29.963
WOULD JUST DIRECT YOU TO PAGE 63

01:39:30.030 --> 01:39:31.365
OF THE ANALYSIS THAT SHOWS THE

01:39:31.432 --> 01:39:32.833
OUTYEAR COSTS ON IT. YEAH. SO

01:39:32.900 --> 01:39:35.502
YOU SEE SIX ON 63. IT SHOWS HOW

01:39:35.569 --> 01:39:38.405
IT GROWS OVER TIME. WHAT HE WAS

01:39:38.472 --> 01:39:39.139
EXPLAINING. THE BIGGER COSTS ARE

01:39:39.206 --> 01:39:41.675
IN 20 2030 OKAY. CORRECT. THANK

01:39:41.742 --> 01:39:43.644
YOU. WELL I AM GLAD TO SEE THAT.

01:39:43.711 --> 01:39:45.612
OF COURSE WE ARE PRIORITIZING

01:39:45.679 --> 01:39:47.781
OUR CULTURAL CAPITAL AND FACTORY

01:39:47.848 --> 01:39:49.883
OF HOLLYWOOD TO MAKE SURE WE'RE

01:39:49.950 --> 01:39:51.218
PRIORITIZING THAT IN CALIFORNIA.

01:39:51.285 --> 01:39:52.319
I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT

01:39:52.386 --> 01:39:54.722
WHILE WE ARE GROWING THIS TAX

01:39:54.788 --> 01:39:56.056
CREDIT, WE STILL HAVE SUSPENDED.

01:39:56.123 --> 01:39:57.358
AND I'VE HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS

01:39:57.424 --> 01:39:59.393
WITH MY COLLEAGUES, BUT WE STILL

01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:00.994
HAVE THE SUSPENSION OF THE R&amp;D

01:40:01.061 --> 01:40:02.329
TAX CREDIT, WHICH IS A BROAD

01:40:02.396 --> 01:40:03.397
SWATH OF INDUSTRY WHERE WE ALSO

01:40:03.464 --> 01:40:05.065
LEAD IN. SO I THINK IT'S

01:40:05.132 --> 01:40:06.200
SOMETHING WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT

01:40:06.266 --> 01:40:08.035
AS WE MAKE LOTS OF DIFFERENT

01:40:08.102 --> 01:40:08.702
CHOICES, THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE

01:40:08.769 --> 01:40:10.237
TO EXPLORE ALL OUR OPTIONS

01:40:10.304 --> 01:40:11.672
HOLISTICALLY. SO I APPRECIATE

01:40:11.739 --> 01:40:12.406
THE ANSWERS AND ALL THOSE

01:40:12.473 --> 01:40:14.408
THINGS. AND THANK YOU, MR.

01:40:14.475 --> 01:40:15.776
CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:40:15.843 --> 01:40:19.780
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. WE WILL NOW GO

01:40:19.847 --> 01:40:21.849
STEPPED OUT. OKAY. THEN WE ARE

01:40:21.915 --> 01:40:24.518
GOING TO GO TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:40:24.585 --> 01:40:27.588
PETRIE-NORRIS. THANK YOU, MR.

01:40:27.654 --> 01:40:30.624
CHAIR. I ALSO HAVE SOME

01:40:30.691 --> 01:40:34.695
QUESTIONS REGARDING AB, SB 130,

01:40:34.762 --> 01:40:37.698
THE HOUSING TRAILER BILL. SOME

01:40:37.765 --> 01:40:40.901
FOLLOW UPS RELATED TO MR. LEE'S

01:40:40.968 --> 01:40:46.640
QUESTIONS. OKAY, SO. I THINK I

01:40:46.707 --> 01:40:49.143
THINK THAT YOU SAID IN RESPONSE

01:40:49.209 --> 01:40:51.378
TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEE'S

01:40:51.445 --> 01:40:54.648
QUESTIONS THAT THE GOAL OF THESE

01:40:54.715 --> 01:40:57.651
NEW WAGE STANDARDS WAS TO

01:40:57.718 --> 01:41:00.854
ADDRESS SORT OF A GAP IN THE

01:41:00.921 --> 01:41:02.122
MARKET WHERE CURRENTLY NEITHER

01:41:02.189 --> 01:41:04.358
PREVAILING WAGE REQUIREMENTS OR

01:41:04.425 --> 01:41:05.826
SKILLED AND TRAINED REQUIREMENTS

01:41:05.893 --> 01:41:07.761
WOULD APPLY, I BELIEVE, IS WHAT

01:41:07.828 --> 01:41:10.164
YOU SAID. YES. MEGAN TOKUNAGA

01:41:10.230 --> 01:41:11.198
EBCLC DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

01:41:11.265 --> 01:41:12.299
TYPICALLY, PROJECTS THAT ARE

01:41:12.366 --> 01:41:14.268
MARKET RATE ARE NOT SUBJECT TO

01:41:14.334 --> 01:41:14.868
PREVAILING WAGE REQUIREMENTS,

01:41:14.935 --> 01:41:16.670
AND THIS IS CREATING A PATH FOR

01:41:16.737 --> 01:41:17.304
A EXEMPTION FOR PROJECTS

01:41:17.371 --> 01:41:20.340
OTHERWISE NOT ABLE. I, I

01:41:20.407 --> 01:41:21.041
UNDERSTAND I UNDERSTAND THAT'S

01:41:21.108 --> 01:41:22.843
THE INTENT. AND I THINK THAT'S

01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:24.511
ALSO I THINK THAT'S OUR INTENT.

01:41:24.578 --> 01:41:27.381
BUT THE LANGUAGE IS DRAFTED. I

01:41:27.448 --> 01:41:29.249
IT'S NOT AT ALL CLEAR TO ME THAT

01:41:29.316 --> 01:41:31.718
THAT'S WHAT IT DOES, BECAUSE WE

01:41:31.785 --> 01:41:34.621
NOW HAVE A TOTALLY NEW WAGE

01:41:34.688 --> 01:41:36.890
SCALE THAT CAN BE APPLIED TO

01:41:36.957 --> 01:41:38.225
PROJECTS, WHICH RIGHT NOW, IN

01:41:38.292 --> 01:41:40.027
ORDER TO RECEIVE A CEQA

01:41:40.093 --> 01:41:41.895
EXEMPTION, WOULD NEED TO PAY

01:41:41.962 --> 01:41:44.631
PREVAILING WAGE OR SKILLED AND

01:41:44.698 --> 01:41:46.133
TRAINED, SKILLED AND TRAINED

01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:48.268
REQUIREMENTS. CORRECT.

01:41:48.335 --> 01:41:49.470
TYPICALLY, PREVAILING WAGE RATES

01:41:49.536 --> 01:41:51.572
APPLY TO PROJECTS THAT ARE

01:41:51.638 --> 01:41:53.373
RECEIVING PUBLIC SUBSIDY, AND IF

01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:55.876
A PROJECT IS SET TO PAY THOSE

01:41:55.943 --> 01:41:57.110
PREVAILING WAGES, OTHERWISE THEY

01:41:57.177 --> 01:42:00.647
HAVE TO PAY THOSE AND STILL

01:42:00.714 --> 01:42:01.315
RECEIVE THE STREAMLINING. RIGHT.

01:42:01.381 --> 01:42:03.150
BUT THIS LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED

01:42:03.217 --> 01:42:05.752
BILLS THAT REQUIRE PRIVATE

01:42:05.819 --> 01:42:07.321
DEVELOPERS TO PAY MEET

01:42:07.387 --> 01:42:08.889
PREVAILING WAGE REQUIREMENTS IN

01:42:08.956 --> 01:42:10.290
ORDER TO RECEIVE A CEQA

01:42:10.357 --> 01:42:12.426
EXEMPTION. SO AND CAN YOU JUST

01:42:12.493 --> 01:42:15.295
WALK US THROUGH WHAT THESE NEW

01:42:15.362 --> 01:42:16.697
MINIMUM WAGE REQUIREMENTS WOULD

01:42:16.763 --> 01:42:22.903
BE? CERTAINLY. SO THE BILL

01:42:22.970 --> 01:42:25.005
BEFORE YOU SETS DOLLAR WAGE

01:42:25.072 --> 01:42:27.307

WORKERS, THE RATE OF $36

01:43:01.408 --> 01:43:03.210

WOULD THAT 6,040% POSSIBLY BE

01:43:21.628 --> 01:43:27.301
DETERMINED OR ENFORCED? THERE?

01:43:27.367 --> 01:43:28.302
EXCUSE ME, GENEVIEVE MORALES,

130, SECTION 57. THERE IS A

01:43:36.476 --> 01:43:38.045
NOTWITHSTANDING CLAUSE IN THERE

01:43:38.111 --> 01:43:39.880
THAT PROTECTS THE CURRENT

01:43:39.947 --> 01:43:41.682
PREVAILING WAGE RATES. AND

01:43:41.748 --> 01:43:43.150
SECOND, TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION

01:43:43.216 --> 01:43:44.418
ON ON THAT SECOND PIECE OF THAT

01:43:44.484 --> 01:43:46.453
QUESTION, IS THERE IS A

01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:47.387
CALCULATION THAT IS DONE TO

01:43:47.454 --> 01:43:49.623
DETERMINE THE PREVAILING WAGE

01:43:49.690 --> 01:43:53.260
RATE RATE. SORRY, THE PREVAILING

01:43:53.327 --> 01:43:55.596
WAGE RATE IN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

01:43:55.662 --> 01:43:57.264
THERE'S THAT CALCULATION THAT'S

01:43:57.331 --> 01:43:58.665
DONE. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT

01:43:58.732 --> 01:44:01.134
TAKES OUT THE HOUSING COMPONENT

01:44:01.201 --> 01:44:03.103
OF IT AND THEN ALLOWS THEM TO

01:44:03.170 --> 01:44:05.439
CALCULATE THE RATE WITHOUT THAT

01:44:05.505 --> 01:44:07.975
HOUSING PIECE ON IT AND IT AND,

01:44:08.041 --> 01:44:10.544
AND THEREBY SETS THE FLOORS

01:44:10.611 --> 01:44:12.379
BASED ON THE NUMBERS THAT ARE IN

01:44:12.446 --> 01:44:13.347
THERE. SO EVERYTHING THAT YOU

01:44:13.413 --> 01:44:15.148
SEE IN THE LANGUAGE IS, IS SET,

01:44:15.215 --> 01:44:16.883
IT SETS FLOORS AND THE

01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:19.152
CALCULATION IS DONE WITHOUT THE

01:44:19.219 --> 01:44:21.288
HOUSING ELEMENT, THE HOUSING

01:44:21.355 --> 01:44:24.324
COMPONENT IN IT. THAT MAKES THIS

01:44:24.391 --> 01:44:25.225
CALCULATION A LITTLE BIT

01:44:25.292 --> 01:44:27.494
DIFFERENT. THAT WOULD CHANGE IT

01:44:27.561 --> 01:44:28.862
CHANGES IT BASED ON WHERE YOU

01:44:28.929 --> 01:44:30.664
ARE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. SO

01:44:30.731 --> 01:44:31.531
THAT'S THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE.

01:44:31.598 --> 01:44:33.233
BUT THERE IS A NOTWITHSTANDING

01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:34.301
CLAUSE THAT WOULDN'T AFFECT

01:44:34.368 --> 01:44:36.069
OTHER PREVAILING WAGE RATES. AND

01:44:36.136 --> 01:44:37.871
THAT IS IN SECTION 57. SO THAT'S

01:44:37.938 --> 01:44:39.606
HOW WE ENSURE THAT WE DON'T MESS

01:44:39.673 --> 01:44:41.942
UP CALCULATIONS FROM LAWS THAT

01:44:42.009 --> 01:44:43.644
WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST. SO I

01:44:43.710 --> 01:44:44.878
WOULD DIRECT YOU BACK TO THAT,

01:44:44.945 --> 01:44:47.214
TO THAT LANGUAGE. AND THEN IT

01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:49.783
ALSO PROVIDES, IF I'M READING IT

01:44:49.850 --> 01:44:51.184
CORRECTLY, SOME SORT OF

01:44:51.251 --> 01:44:54.521
DEDUCTION FOR HEALTH CARE

01:44:54.588 --> 01:44:56.156
CONTRIBUTIONS. CORRECT. WHICH

01:44:56.223 --> 01:44:57.791
HAVE WE EVER DONE THAT BEFORE

01:44:57.858 --> 01:45:00.961
THAT THAT SEEMED UNUSUAL TO ME.

01:45:01.028 --> 01:45:02.129
LET ME GET YOU AN ANSWER ON THAT

01:45:02.195 --> 01:45:04.131
ONE, AND I WILL FOLLOW UP ON

01:45:04.197 --> 01:45:06.400
THAT ON THAT PIECE OF IT. OKAY.

01:45:06.466 --> 01:45:07.968
AND THEN I THINK IT ALSO DOES

01:45:08.035 --> 01:45:09.836
SOMETHING. IT DOES CHANGE

01:45:09.903 --> 01:45:13.140
REQUIREMENTS FOR PROJECTS OVER

01:45:13.206 --> 01:45:24.818
85FT. CORRECT.

01:45:24.885 --> 01:45:25.786
I DON'T HAVE THAT AT MY

01:45:25.852 --> 01:45:27.287
FINGERTIPS. I CAN FOLLOW UP AND

01:45:27.354 --> 01:45:28.989
GET BACK TO YOU. APOLOGIES.

01:45:29.056 --> 01:45:30.490
OKAY. AND I THINK JUST TO BE

01:45:30.557 --> 01:45:32.426
CLEAR, IN TERMS OF MY LINE OF

01:45:32.492 --> 01:45:34.928
QUESTIONING, I THINK THAT THAT I

01:45:34.995 --> 01:45:35.529
AND I IMAGINE OTHERS ON THE

01:45:35.595 --> 01:45:36.997
COMMITTEE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:45:37.064 --> 01:45:38.965
THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE

01:45:39.032 --> 01:45:41.501
IMPLICATIONS OF ANY CHANGES THAT

01:45:41.568 --> 01:45:44.871
WE ARE MAKING TO LABOR

01:45:44.938 --> 01:45:47.374
STANDARDS, TO WAGE STANDARDS, IF

01:45:47.441 --> 01:45:50.210
THE GOAL IS TO KIND OF PROVIDE,

01:45:50.277 --> 01:45:52.045
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY SORT OF A

01:45:52.112 --> 01:45:53.447
BACKSTOP FOR A SECTION OF

01:45:53.513 --> 01:45:55.215
HOUSING FOR WHICH THERE IS NONE.

01:45:55.282 --> 01:45:57.751
I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE. IF WE'RE

01:45:57.818 --> 01:45:59.986
UNRAVELING, YOU KNOW, LONG

01:46:00.053 --> 01:46:01.354
STANDING LABOR PROTECTIONS AND

01:46:01.421 --> 01:46:03.557
STANDARDS. I THINK THAT THAT'S

01:46:03.623 --> 01:46:05.325
CONCERNING. I THINK I THINK THE

01:46:05.392 --> 01:46:06.660
GOAL IS WHAT YOU STATED

01:46:06.727 --> 01:46:08.361
CURRENTLY, AND I THINK THAT THE

01:46:08.428 --> 01:46:09.229
LANGUAGE THAT'S INCLUDED IN

01:46:09.296 --> 01:46:12.165
LABOR SECTION 17 70.1, I THINK

01:46:12.232 --> 01:46:15.936
IT'S SECTION 54, IS THERE TO

01:46:16.002 --> 01:46:16.870
PROTECT THOSE LONG STANDING

01:46:16.937 --> 01:46:18.405
LABOR STANDARDS THAT ARE THERE.

01:46:18.472 --> 01:46:20.974
SO I WOULD DIRECT YOU THERE IF

01:46:21.041 --> 01:46:21.608
YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS,

01:46:21.675 --> 01:46:23.243
WE'RE HAPPY TO HELP YOU. ALL

01:46:23.310 --> 01:46:25.178
RIGHT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. OKAY.

01:46:25.245 --> 01:46:28.115
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GO NOW TO

01:46:28.181 --> 01:46:31.284
MR. ALVAREZ. ALVAREZ, THANK YOU

01:46:31.351 --> 01:46:33.553
VERY MUCH. AND THANK YOU ALL FOR

01:46:33.620 --> 01:46:35.622
THE WORK THAT YOU DO. REALLY,

01:46:35.689 --> 01:46:37.891
REALLY APPRECIATE YOU. I THINK

01:46:37.958 --> 01:46:39.226
I'LL MAKE SOME VERY BRIEF

01:46:39.292 --> 01:46:42.062
REMARKS ABOUT THE EDUCATION

01:46:42.129 --> 01:46:46.366
BUDGET AS PRESENTED TODAY. WE

01:46:46.433 --> 01:46:48.135
TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE

01:46:48.201 --> 01:46:49.669
PRIORITIES IN THE LAST HEARING

01:46:49.736 --> 01:46:51.471
WHEN WE DISCUSSED BUDGET. SO I

01:46:51.538 --> 01:46:53.640
WON'T GO INTO DETAILS. I THINK

01:46:53.707 --> 01:46:54.841
ONE OF THE THINGS, AS I'VE

01:46:54.908 --> 01:46:56.943
TALKED TO SEVERAL

01:46:57.010 --> 01:46:59.346
SUPERINTENDENTS OF EDUCATION

01:46:59.412 --> 01:47:00.614
FROM THROUGHOUT DIFFERENT PARTS

01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:02.983
OF THE STATE, ACTUALLY ON THEIR

01:47:03.049 --> 01:47:05.185
CONCERNS WITH THE FUNDING FOR

01:47:05.252 --> 01:47:07.721
EDUCATION. I THINK THIS BUDGET

01:47:07.788 --> 01:47:08.355
CERTAINLY IS REFLECTIVE OF THOSE

01:47:08.421 --> 01:47:09.456
CHANGES, BUT I THINK IT'S

01:47:09.523 --> 01:47:10.824
IMPORTANT FOR ME TO SAY HERE

01:47:10.891 --> 01:47:12.959
TODAY, AS I MENTIONED TO EACH OF

01:47:13.026 --> 01:47:15.162
THEM INDIVIDUALLY, WHILE THIS IS

01:47:15.228 --> 01:47:17.164
MOST DEFINITELY A VERY STRONG

01:47:17.230 --> 01:47:20.133
BUDGET FOR EDUCATION, THE YEARS

01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:22.002
AHEAD ARE GOING TO BE

01:47:22.068 --> 01:47:23.837
CHALLENGING AND THERE ARE FUNDS

01:47:23.904 --> 01:47:27.107
IN THIS BUDGET THAT SHOULD BE

01:47:27.174 --> 01:47:29.576
SPENT WISELY, THOUGHTFULLY, AND

01:47:29.643 --> 01:47:32.212
NOT WITH THE ANTICIPATION THAT

01:47:32.279 --> 01:47:34.915
THIS IS LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE

01:47:34.981 --> 01:47:36.683
BECAUSE YEARS AHEAD ARE

01:47:36.750 --> 01:47:38.485
DIFFICULT. AND SO I JUST WANT TO

01:47:38.552 --> 01:47:40.620
MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S

01:47:40.687 --> 01:47:41.221
ACKNOWLEDGED, BECAUSE THAT'S

01:47:41.288 --> 01:47:42.322
IMPORTANT. I HAVE A COUPLE OF

01:47:42.389 --> 01:47:44.724
QUESTIONS ABOUT A FEW OTHER

01:47:44.791 --> 01:47:45.892
THINGS, THOUGH, THAT I'D LIKE TO

01:47:45.959 --> 01:47:47.394
ASK, AND I'M TRYING TO IDENTIFY

01:47:47.460 --> 01:47:50.864
WHICH BILL IT IS, BUT I HAVEN'T

01:47:50.931 --> 01:47:54.134
BEEN ABLE TO. OUR SUMMARY

01:47:54.201 --> 01:47:57.704
MENTIONS THAT THERE IS FUNDING

01:47:57.771 --> 01:48:02.375
FOR. CHILD YOUTH BEHAVIORAL

01:48:02.442 --> 01:48:05.512
INITIATIVE, WHICH WAS FUNDED

01:48:05.579 --> 01:48:07.447
QUITE SUBSTANTIALLY A FEW YEARS

01:48:07.514 --> 01:48:11.017
AGO. AND I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHAT

01:48:11.084 --> 01:48:12.452
THIS FUNDING IS PARTICULARLY

01:48:12.519 --> 01:48:15.655
ABOUT. AND I'M MORE CONCERNED

01:48:15.722 --> 01:48:17.757
ABOUT THE STATUS OF WHAT I KEEP

01:48:17.824 --> 01:48:19.326
HEARING FROM OUR SCHOOLS THAT

01:48:19.392 --> 01:48:21.862
THIS FUNDING IS ACTUALLY NOT THE

01:48:21.928 --> 01:48:23.663
FUNDING FROM A FEW YEARS AGO

01:48:23.730 --> 01:48:25.065
WAS, HAS NOT BEEN, HAS NOT

01:48:25.131 --> 01:48:27.267
REACHED SCHOOLS, WHICH MEANS I

01:48:27.334 --> 01:48:29.636
THINK ALL OF US HAVE HEARD THAT

01:48:29.703 --> 01:48:30.503
MENTAL HEALTH FOR OUR CHILDREN

01:48:30.570 --> 01:48:32.906
IS BECOMING A BIGGER AND BIGGER

01:48:32.973 --> 01:48:34.374
CHALLENGE IN OUR SCHOOLS. AND IT

01:48:34.441 --> 01:48:36.209
SOUNDS LIKE THIS FUNDING HAS NOT

01:48:36.276 --> 01:48:37.444
BEEN DEPLOYED YET. SO I'D LIKE

01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:39.613
TO KNOW WHAT THIS FUNDING IN

01:48:39.679 --> 01:48:41.147
THIS YEAR'S BUDGET AND WHAT'S

01:48:41.214 --> 01:48:43.683
THE STATUS OF THE PRIOR YEAR'S

01:48:43.750 --> 01:48:45.085
ALLOCATIONS. CAN I PLEASE

01:48:45.151 --> 01:48:47.721
CLARIFY, CHAIR ALVAREZ, ARE YOU

01:48:47.787 --> 01:48:49.022
REFERRING TO THE 20 MILLION FOR

01:48:49.089 --> 01:48:51.358
THE CI AND THE. NO. I'M LOOKING

01:48:51.424 --> 01:48:55.595
I'M LOOKING AT THE SUMMARY PAGE

01:48:55.662 --> 01:48:57.030
TWO FOR AGENDA ITEM NUMBER 11

01:48:57.097 --> 01:48:59.833
UNDER THE HEALTH. SO THAT WOULD

01:48:59.900 --> 01:49:02.202
PROBABLY BE THE RIGHT SENATE

01:49:02.269 --> 01:49:04.838
BILL. BUT THE HEALTH SUMMARY

01:49:04.905 --> 01:49:08.008
NUMBER 11 PROVIDES $127 MILLION

01:49:08.074 --> 01:49:09.843
IN 2526 FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

01:49:09.910 --> 01:49:12.412
VIRTUAL SERVICES PLATFORM. I

01:49:12.479 --> 01:49:13.914
DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:17.384
PLATFORM. AND THEN IT SAYS UNDER

01:49:17.450 --> 01:49:19.152
THE CHILDREN YOUTH BEHAVIORAL

01:49:19.219 --> 01:49:20.820
HEALTH INITIATIVE. LARA

01:49:20.887 --> 01:49:23.323
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. YES, THE

01:49:23.390 --> 01:49:26.559
BUDGET MAINTAINS FUNDING FOR THE.

01:49:26.626 --> 01:49:28.361
IT'S CALLED THE VIRTUAL

01:49:28.428 --> 01:49:30.063
PLATFORM. AND IT WAS PART OF THE

01:49:30.130 --> 01:49:31.131
CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL

01:49:31.197 --> 01:49:32.265
HEALTH INITIATIVE THAT WAS

01:49:32.332 --> 01:49:34.067
IMPLEMENTED A FEW YEARS BACK.

01:49:34.134 --> 01:49:36.169
AND THAT INCLUDES A FEW

01:49:36.236 --> 01:49:37.971
DIFFERENT CONTRACTS. BUT

01:49:38.038 --> 01:49:40.140
PRIMARILY THERE'S TWO CONTRACTS

01:49:40.206 --> 01:49:42.442
THAT PROVIDE VIRTUAL BEHAVIORAL

01:49:42.509 --> 01:49:46.079
HEALTH SERVICES AND COACHING TO

01:49:46.146 --> 01:49:48.581
FOR CHILDREN. I'M FAMILIAR WITH

01:49:48.648 --> 01:49:50.383
THOSE. SO I THINK I KNOW WHAT

01:49:50.450 --> 01:49:51.851
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. WHAT IS

01:49:51.918 --> 01:49:53.687
THE STATUS OF THE ACTUAL REST OF

01:49:53.753 --> 01:49:55.221
THE FUNDING, THE NON-VIRTUAL,

01:49:55.288 --> 01:49:56.423
THE FUNDING THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO

01:49:56.489 --> 01:49:58.858
BE DEPLOYED SO THAT STUDENTS HAD

01:49:58.925 --> 01:50:01.561
ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

01:50:01.628 --> 01:50:04.331
AT SCHOOLS. THE I THINK YOU'RE

01:50:04.397 --> 01:50:08.902
REFERRING TO THE SCHOOL, THE

01:50:08.969 --> 01:50:11.838
VENDOR FOR THE SCHOOL FEE

01:50:11.905 --> 01:50:13.707
SCHEDULE. AND THAT IS SOMETHING

01:50:13.773 --> 01:50:14.808
THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH

01:50:14.874 --> 01:50:16.309
CARE SERVICES IS CONTINUING TO

01:50:16.376 --> 01:50:19.179
WORK WITH SCHOOLS AND THE VENDOR

01:50:19.245 --> 01:50:22.048
ON IN ORDER TO REIMBURSE FOR

01:50:22.115 --> 01:50:24.718
THOSE CLAIMS. I'M ALSO REFERRING

01:50:24.784 --> 01:50:26.453
TO THE CHILDREN'S BEHAVIORAL

01:50:26.519 --> 01:50:27.921
HEALTH INITIATIVE GENERALLY,

01:50:27.988 --> 01:50:30.256
WHICH I UNDERSTAND IS NOT BEEN

01:50:30.323 --> 01:50:32.325
DEPLOYED TO SCHOOLS. IS THAT

01:50:32.392 --> 01:50:33.893
CORRECT? THERE ARE MANY

01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:36.663
DIFFERENT PIECES OF THE CHILDREN

01:50:36.730 --> 01:50:38.031
AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

01:50:38.098 --> 01:50:39.332
INITIATIVE. SO I THINK YOU'RE

01:50:39.399 --> 01:50:41.701
REFERRING TO SPECIFICALLY THE

01:50:41.768 --> 01:50:43.937
FUNDING TO REIMBURSE THE

01:50:44.004 --> 01:50:46.139
SERVICES FOR SCHOOLS. AND I

01:50:46.206 --> 01:50:48.608
WOULD SAY THAT OVERALL, I THINK

01:50:48.675 --> 01:50:50.577
THAT A SMALL PORTION HAS GONE

01:50:50.643 --> 01:50:52.245
OUT. BUT THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:50:52.312 --> 01:50:53.213
HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS

01:50:53.279 --> 01:50:54.881
CONTINUING TO WORK WITH SCHOOLS.

01:50:54.948 --> 01:50:55.448
AND THAT WAS BUDGETED. WHICH

01:50:55.515 --> 01:51:00.720
YEAR, I BELIEVE IT WAS IN 2022

01:51:00.787 --> 01:51:04.891
AROUND THERE. OKAY, I WANT TO

01:51:04.958 --> 01:51:05.792
RAISE A SERIOUS CONCERN ABOUT

01:51:05.859 --> 01:51:07.327
THAT AT THIS MOMENT GOING

01:51:07.394 --> 01:51:09.763
FORWARD. IT'S BEEN THREE YEARS

01:51:09.829 --> 01:51:11.231
OF THAT ALLOCATION AND I JUST

01:51:11.297 --> 01:51:13.133
KEEP HEARING FROM ALL SCHOOL

01:51:13.199 --> 01:51:14.267
DISTRICTS, YOU KNOW, THE ONE

01:51:14.334 --> 01:51:15.835
TIME MONEY'S GONE AWAY. WE NEED

01:51:15.902 --> 01:51:17.670
TO PROVIDE HEALTH, MENTAL HEALTH

01:51:17.737 --> 01:51:19.305
SERVICES TO OUR STUDENTS AND WE

01:51:19.372 --> 01:51:21.307
HAVE NO FUNDING TO DO SO. THAT'S

01:51:21.374 --> 01:51:22.409
WHY THEY PUSHED SO HARD TO ALL

01:51:22.475 --> 01:51:24.377
THE FUNDING THAT WE HAVE IN

01:51:24.444 --> 01:51:26.413
EDUCATION IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET,

01:51:26.479 --> 01:51:27.113
IN ORDER TO ALLOW THAT THE 20

01:51:27.180 --> 01:51:28.281
MILLION ALLOCATION WHICH THE

01:51:28.348 --> 01:51:30.450
LEGISLATURE PUT IN IS TO SUPPORT

01:51:30.517 --> 01:51:33.353
THAT. I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING

01:51:33.420 --> 01:51:34.854
WE NEED TO JUST PAY CLOSER

01:51:34.921 --> 01:51:36.089
ATTENTION TO AND MAKE SURE IT

01:51:36.156 --> 01:51:37.457
GETS DEPLOYED AND THAT SCHOOLS

01:51:37.524 --> 01:51:40.093
ARE RECEIVING THESE SERVICES. WE

01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:42.595
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND JUST WANTED

01:51:42.662 --> 01:51:43.596
TO FLAG THAT. WE ARE WORKING

01:51:43.663 --> 01:51:45.799
WITH LEGISLATIVE STAFF ON

01:51:45.865 --> 01:51:49.035
ADDITIONAL TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE

01:51:49.102 --> 01:51:50.203
TO INCREASE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR

01:51:50.270 --> 01:51:51.604
THE VENDOR TO GET THOSE THOSE

01:51:51.671 --> 01:51:52.972

01:51:53.039 --> 01:51:54.874
IT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR

01:51:54.941 --> 01:51:57.343
GIVING US THAT INFORMATION ON

01:51:57.410 --> 01:52:01.014
SENATE BILL 124. I ASSUME THIS

01:52:01.081 --> 01:52:02.148
IS WHERE I WOULD FIND AND I

01:52:02.215 --> 01:52:05.285
COULD BE WRONG. THERE WAS A

01:52:05.351 --> 01:52:09.923
PREVIOUSLY EXEMPTIONS TO SYRIA

01:52:09.989 --> 01:52:13.593
SENATE BILL FROM 2011. I BELIEVE

01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:15.728
THAT'S NO LONGER IN IN THE

01:52:15.795 --> 01:52:17.464
BUDGET FROM WHAT I'M READING IT.

01:52:17.530 --> 01:52:19.833
CAN I JUST GET THAT CONFIRMATION

01:52:19.899 --> 01:52:25.572
FROM STAFF? I BELIEVE YOU'RE

01:52:25.638 --> 01:52:27.340
REFERRING TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY

01:52:27.407 --> 01:52:29.843
TRAILER BILL. IT IT PROBABLY

01:52:29.909 --> 01:52:31.478
WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE

01:52:31.544 --> 01:52:35.148
RESOURCES, I ASSUME SHY ASSEMBLY

01:52:35.215 --> 01:52:37.016
BUDGET COMMITTEE. THERE ARE NO

01:52:37.083 --> 01:52:38.218
EXEMPTIONS TO SYRIA IN THIS

01:52:38.284 --> 01:52:40.153
BUDGET PACKAGE. OKAY. THANK YOU

01:52:40.220 --> 01:52:42.555
FOR THAT CLARITY. AND I WANT TO

01:52:42.622 --> 01:52:43.857
THANK MEMBERS OF THE PROBLEM

01:52:43.923 --> 01:52:44.858
SOLVERS CAUCUS. WE'VE BEEN

01:52:44.924 --> 01:52:46.292
WORKING ON TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

01:52:46.359 --> 01:52:47.527
HOW TO CREATE MORE

01:52:47.594 --> 01:52:48.995
ACCOUNTABILITY. AND I THINK

01:52:49.062 --> 01:52:49.996
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PROCESS. SO

01:52:50.063 --> 01:52:53.399
THANK YOU FOR CONFIRMING THAT.

01:52:53.466 --> 01:52:55.969
MY NEXT QUESTION IS ON THE CLEAN

01:52:56.035 --> 01:52:57.604
CARS FOR ALL. SO I MAY HAVE TO

01:52:57.670 --> 01:52:59.339
MAKE YOU COME RIGHT BACK UP. I'M

01:52:59.405 --> 01:53:03.510
SORRY, I SHOULD HAVE SAID THAT.

01:53:03.576 --> 01:53:05.745
ITEM NUMBER EIGHT IN THE SUMMARY

01:53:05.812 --> 01:53:07.914
EXPANDS THE REQUIREMENTS FOR

01:53:07.981 --> 01:53:09.415
CLEAN CARS FOR ALL. AND THERE'S

01:53:09.482 --> 01:53:12.418
A 21 TO 22 MENTION. CAN YOU TELL

01:53:12.485 --> 01:53:15.121
ME, IS THIS BECAUSE THERE'S

01:53:15.188 --> 01:53:17.957
RESOURCES FROM 2122 THAT HAVE

01:53:18.024 --> 01:53:19.225
NOT BEEN DEPLOYED YET? PEOPLE

01:53:19.292 --> 01:53:21.127
ARE NOT UTILIZING THIS PROGRAM.

01:53:21.194 --> 01:53:24.063
IS THAT THE REASON WHY? AGAIN,

01:53:24.130 --> 01:53:26.199
ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE? THAT

01:53:26.266 --> 01:53:27.901
IS CORRECT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

01:53:27.967 --> 01:53:29.469
THERE IS MONEY THAT WAS

01:53:29.536 --> 01:53:31.237
APPROPRIATED IN 2021 AND 2022.

01:53:31.304 --> 01:53:34.474
THAT CARB IS STILL ROLLING OUT

01:53:34.541 --> 01:53:36.009
CARBS, HAS SOME MONEY ALREADY

01:53:36.075 --> 01:53:37.410
COMMITTED. IT HAS NOT FULLY

01:53:37.477 --> 01:53:38.811
COMMITTED YET. AND SO THERE ARE

01:53:38.878 --> 01:53:39.913
STAKEHOLDERS AND ASSEMBLY

01:53:39.979 --> 01:53:41.314
MEMBERS WHO WANTED THAT TO BE

01:53:41.381 --> 01:53:43.183
AVAILABLE TO BE SHIFTED TO THE

01:53:43.249 --> 01:53:44.617
DISTRICT BASED CLEAN CARS FOR

01:53:44.684 --> 01:53:46.386
ALL PROGRAMS. SO THIS LANGUAGE

01:53:46.452 --> 01:53:48.188
WOULD ENABLE THAT TO HAPPEN IF

01:53:48.254 --> 01:53:49.556
CARB CHOOSES TO DO THAT THROUGH

01:53:49.622 --> 01:53:50.723
THEIR PUBLIC PROCESS LATER IN

01:53:50.790 --> 01:53:53.159
THE YEAR. HOW MUCH FUNDING ARE

01:53:53.226 --> 01:53:55.328
WE TALKING ABOUT FINANCE IN THIS

01:53:55.395 --> 01:53:58.898
PROGRAM? AARON CARSON DEPARTMENT

01:53:58.965 --> 01:54:00.400
OF FINANCE I HAVE TO GET BACK TO

01:54:00.466 --> 01:54:02.268
YOU WITH EXACT NUMBERS ON WHAT

01:54:02.335 --> 01:54:03.336
FUNDING IS STILL REMAINING FROM

01:54:03.403 --> 01:54:05.271
PRIOR YEARS. OKAY. DO YOU HAPPEN

01:54:05.338 --> 01:54:08.107
TO KNOW THAT I'LL NEED TO GET

01:54:08.174 --> 01:54:09.375
BACK TO YOU WITH CERTAINTY, BUT

01:54:09.442 --> 01:54:12.111
I BELIEVE IT'S AROUND $260

01:54:12.178 --> 01:54:13.379
MILLION, AND THAT FUNDING HAS

01:54:13.446 --> 01:54:14.781
ALREADY TECHNICALLY BEEN

01:54:14.847 --> 01:54:15.748
ENCUMBERED AND HAS BEEN GIVEN TO

01:54:15.815 --> 01:54:18.518
THE THIRD PARTY IMPLEMENTER TO

01:54:18.585 --> 01:54:19.752
IMPLEMENT. BUT IT'S INDIVIDUAL

01:54:19.819 --> 01:54:22.255
CAR PURCHASERS. AND GIVEN THAT

01:54:22.322 --> 01:54:23.423
THEY'RE LOW INCOME AND THERE ARE

01:54:23.489 --> 01:54:24.490
LOTS OF REQUIREMENTS, THIS

01:54:24.557 --> 01:54:26.593
PROGRAM, IT DOES TAKE A LONG

01:54:26.659 --> 01:54:27.460
TIME FOR THEM TO CHOOSE THE

01:54:27.527 --> 01:54:29.629
PERSON, GET THE CAR, DO THE

01:54:29.696 --> 01:54:31.130
GRANT AGREEMENTS, ETC. AND

01:54:31.197 --> 01:54:32.832
THAT'S ALREADY ONGOING AT CARB,

01:54:32.899 --> 01:54:35.368
WHICH IS WHY THE LANGUAGE THAT

01:54:35.435 --> 01:54:35.969
WE ADOPTED IS THE WAY THAT WE

01:54:36.035 --> 01:54:37.437
ADOPTED IT. THANK YOU.

01:54:37.503 --> 01:54:38.338
APPRECIATE YOU BOTH. JUST

01:54:38.404 --> 01:54:39.472
COMMENT FOR US. I THINK ANY

01:54:39.539 --> 01:54:41.140
PROGRAM THAT'S, YOU KNOW,

01:54:41.207 --> 01:54:42.575
REACHING FIVE YEAR MILESTONE AND

01:54:42.642 --> 01:54:43.643
WE STILL HAVE HUNDREDS OF

01:54:43.710 --> 01:54:44.544
MILLION DOLLARS, I THINK THERE'S

01:54:44.611 --> 01:54:47.947
SOMETHING TO BE REVISITED THERE.

01:54:48.014 --> 01:54:49.716
MY LAST QUESTION IS ON THE

01:54:49.782 --> 01:54:53.119
CALIFORNIA FILM AND TAX, FILM

01:54:53.186 --> 01:54:55.221
AND TELEVISION TAX CREDIT

01:54:55.288 --> 01:55:00.093
EXPANSION. I'D BE INTERESTED IN

01:55:00.159 --> 01:55:03.062
UNDERSTANDING WHETHER THIS

01:55:03.129 --> 01:55:07.734
EXPANSION IS GOING TO INCLUDE AN

01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:11.104
INCREASE TO THE OUT OF MARKET

01:55:11.170 --> 01:55:12.705
PRODUCERS AND ALSO TO THE

01:55:12.772 --> 01:55:14.874
INDEPENDENT PRODUCERS. IS THAT

01:55:14.941 --> 01:55:19.612
PART OF THIS BUDGET TODAY? JACOB

01:55:19.679 --> 01:55:21.547
KERN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SO

01:55:21.614 --> 01:55:23.950
THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL ONLY

01:55:24.017 --> 01:55:28.354
INCREASES THE INCREASE FROM 330

01:55:28.421 --> 01:55:30.056
MILLION TO 750 MILLION IN YEARLY

01:55:30.123 --> 01:55:31.491
ALLOCATIONS. IT DOESN'T INCLUDE

01:55:31.557 --> 01:55:33.993
ANY OTHER PROGRAMMATIC CHANGES.

01:55:34.060 --> 01:55:35.295
I ASSUME BY OUT OF MARKET, YOU

01:55:35.361 --> 01:55:37.630
MEAN OUTSIDE OF THE LA REGION,

01:55:37.697 --> 01:55:38.998
CORRECT? YEAH, THAT IS NOT IN

01:55:39.065 --> 01:55:42.669
HERE. SO IF THOSE CHANGES DO NOT

01:55:42.735 --> 01:55:44.804
OCCUR, THIS PROGRAM WILL

01:55:44.871 --> 01:55:46.572
CONTINUE TO OFFER THE TAX

01:55:46.639 --> 01:55:48.908
CREDITS AS IS. THAT'S CORRECT.

01:55:48.975 --> 01:55:52.745
YEAH. IS THERE AN INTENT TO MAKE

01:55:52.812 --> 01:55:54.380
CHANGES TO THIS PROGRAM THAT ARE

01:55:54.447 --> 01:55:55.615
GOING TO BE COMING FORWARD TO

01:55:55.682 --> 01:55:58.051
THE LEGISLATURE? SO THE

01:55:58.117 --> 01:56:00.353
ADMINISTRATION, YOU KNOW, WHEN

01:56:00.420 --> 01:56:03.122
DRAFTING THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL,

01:56:03.189 --> 01:56:05.458
KEPT IN MIND THAT IN THE 2023

01:56:05.525 --> 01:56:08.161
BUDGET ACT, THE PROGRAM 4.0 WAS

01:56:08.227 --> 01:56:09.162
ESTABLISHED AND SOME CHANGES

01:56:09.228 --> 01:56:11.364
WERE MADE TO THE PROGRAM AT THAT

01:56:11.431 --> 01:56:13.633
TIME, INCLUDING ADDING A PARTIAL

01:56:13.700 --> 01:56:15.468
REFUNDABILITY OPTION TO THE TAX

01:56:15.535 --> 01:56:18.237
CREDITS, INTRODUCING SOME NEW

01:56:18.304 --> 01:56:22.308
DIVERSITY REQUIREMENTS, AND

01:56:22.375 --> 01:56:23.343
GIVEN THAT THOSE CHANGES HAVEN'T

01:56:23.409 --> 01:56:25.712
GONE INTO EFFECT YET, WE THOUGHT

01:56:25.778 --> 01:56:28.047
THE BEST APPROACH WAS TO WAIT

01:56:28.114 --> 01:56:31.818
UNTIL THE PROGRAM COULD BEGIN IN

01:56:31.884 --> 01:56:33.186
ORDER TO SEE WHAT THE EFFECT OF

01:56:33.252 --> 01:56:34.921
THOSE WOULD BE ON THE PROGRAM

01:56:34.987 --> 01:56:36.723
AND IF CHANGES WERE STILL

01:56:36.789 --> 01:56:38.891
NEEDED. THAT BEING SAID, YOU

01:56:38.958 --> 01:56:40.226
KNOW, WE ARE AWARE OF A FEW

01:56:40.293 --> 01:56:41.761
POLICY BILLS THAT MAKE SOME OF

01:56:41.828 --> 01:56:45.732
THOSE CHANGES. AND WE'RE WE'RE

01:56:45.798 --> 01:56:46.999
WATCHING THOSE AND WE'RE, YOU

01:56:47.066 --> 01:56:48.468
KNOW, THE ADMINISTRATION'S

01:56:48.534 --> 01:56:51.237
INTERESTED IN. BUT THERE'S PART

01:56:51.304 --> 01:56:52.605
OF THE NEGOTIATIONS. THERE'S NO

01:56:52.672 --> 01:56:54.040
SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS TO

01:56:54.107 --> 01:56:55.108
ADDRESSING THOSE CHANGES THAT

01:56:55.174 --> 01:56:57.677
THE LEGISLATURE IS SEEKING, NOT

01:56:57.744 --> 01:57:01.948
IN THE BUDGET. NO. OKAY. THANK

01:57:02.014 --> 01:57:05.585
YOU, MR. CHAIR. THANK YOU. THANK

01:57:05.651 --> 01:57:07.220

JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR

01:57:08.888 --> 01:57:10.923
VERY ABLE LEADERSHIP OF THE

01:57:10.990 --> 01:57:12.925
SUBCOMMITTEE AND ALSO FOR YOUR

01:57:12.992 --> 01:57:14.827
SINCERE AND OBVIOUS COMMITMENT

01:57:14.894 --> 01:57:16.629
TO OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY

01:57:16.696 --> 01:57:18.097
AND MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE

01:57:18.164 --> 01:57:19.632
DOING THE BEST THAT WE CAN WITH

01:57:19.699 --> 01:57:21.267
SCARCE RESOURCES. SO THANK YOU

01:57:21.334 --> 01:57:23.102
VERY MUCH. MEMBER. I WANT TO GO

01:57:23.169 --> 01:57:24.504
NOW TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER. I KNOW

01:57:24.570 --> 01:57:26.205
HE HAS ANOTHER COMMITTEE HE

01:57:26.272 --> 01:57:27.273
NEEDS TO BE IN. THANK YOU, MR.

01:57:27.340 --> 01:57:29.308
CHAIR. I DO HAVE TO GO TO THE

01:57:29.375 --> 01:57:31.110
SENATE LABOR COMMITTEE AND

01:57:31.177 --> 01:57:32.445
PRESENT A BILL THAT I HAVE. BUT

01:57:32.512 --> 01:57:33.479
I DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE WITHOUT

01:57:33.546 --> 01:57:35.615
MAKING A QUICK COMMENT. FIRST

01:57:35.681 --> 01:57:36.416
AND FOREMOST, I WANT TO AMPLIFY

01:57:36.482 --> 01:57:38.384
THE WORK THAT THE BUDGET

01:57:38.451 --> 01:57:39.452
COMMITTEE AND MISTER CHAIR HAS

01:57:39.519 --> 01:57:40.620
DONE WITH THE HEALTH CARE, WITH

01:57:40.686 --> 01:57:41.287
EDUCATION, OBVIOUSLY, PRIORITIES

01:57:41.354 --> 01:57:43.289
FOR CALIFORNIA VALUES. AND I

01:57:43.356 --> 01:57:44.357
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL

01:57:44.424 --> 01:57:45.191
CALIFORNIANS FEEL SUPPORTED BY

01:57:45.258 --> 01:57:47.026
OUR STATE. I DID HAVE A CONCERN

01:57:47.093 --> 01:57:48.928
REGARDING, YOU KNOW, THE HOUSING

01:57:48.995 --> 01:57:50.696
TRAILER BILL. I'VE EXPRESSED

01:57:50.763 --> 01:57:53.065
SOME CONCERN. THE, YOU KNOW, THE

01:57:53.132 --> 01:57:55.835
BUILDING TRADES HAVE SHARED SOME

01:57:55.902 --> 01:57:58.404
CONCERNS WITH ME. I KNOW MR. LEE

01:57:58.471 --> 01:58:00.206
AND OTHER FOLKS HAVE ASKED

01:58:00.273 --> 01:58:01.374
QUESTIONS, BUT DEFINITELY IF

01:58:01.441 --> 01:58:02.508
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A

01:58:02.575 --> 01:58:03.342
CONVERSATION LATER TODAY ABOUT

01:58:03.409 --> 01:58:05.278
THIS BECAUSE I KNOW WE HAVE A

01:58:05.344 --> 01:58:07.413
BUDGET TO APPROVE ON FRIDAY, I

01:58:07.480 --> 01:58:08.381
WANT TO BE PART OF THOSE

01:58:08.448 --> 01:58:09.615
CONVERSATIONS. IT'S CONFUSING TO

01:58:09.682 --> 01:58:11.384
ME THE FORMULA, AND I DO ALL

01:58:11.451 --> 01:58:12.985
RESPECT TO ALL THE AMAZING STAFF

01:58:13.052 --> 01:58:14.187
THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE

01:58:14.253 --> 01:58:15.555
WORKING ON THIS. IT'S CONFUSING

01:58:15.621 --> 01:58:16.956
TO ME. THE PERCENT OF WORKERS

01:58:17.023 --> 01:58:18.958
EARNING DIFFERENT WAGES, IT'S

01:58:19.025 --> 01:58:20.293
JUST THE COUNTIES. I JUST

01:58:20.359 --> 01:58:21.828
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME. IT

01:58:21.894 --> 01:58:23.296
SOUNDS LIKE A LOGISTICAL

01:58:23.362 --> 01:58:24.697
NIGHTMARE, TO BE HONEST WITH

01:58:24.764 --> 01:58:26.732
YOU. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, YOU

01:58:26.799 --> 01:58:28.601
KNOW, WE'RE CREATING, YOU KNOW,

01:58:28.668 --> 01:58:32.939
A SLIPPERY SLOPE AND THE WAGE

01:58:33.005 --> 01:58:34.040
CONVERSATION. SO AGAIN, BEING

01:58:34.106 --> 01:58:35.374
RESPECTFUL OF THE PROCESS, I

01:58:35.441 --> 01:58:37.376
WANT TO MAKE SURE I LEARN MORE

01:58:37.443 --> 01:58:39.045
AND UNDERSTAND IT MORE. BUT AS

01:58:39.111 --> 01:58:40.346
WE HAVE TO APPROVE THIS ON

01:58:40.413 --> 01:58:42.348
FRIDAY, I WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:58:42.415 --> 01:58:43.316
THAT, YOU KNOW, SOME OF MY MORE

01:58:43.382 --> 01:58:44.350
QUESTIONS ARE DETAILED ARE

01:58:44.417 --> 01:58:46.252
ANSWERED. I KNOW THAT MR. LEE

01:58:46.319 --> 01:58:47.386
AND OTHERS ALREADY ASKED

01:58:47.453 --> 01:58:48.187
QUESTIONS, BUT I AM CONCERNED

01:58:48.254 --> 01:58:49.622
THAT WE'RE CREATING POSSIBLE A

01:58:49.689 --> 01:58:50.690
NIGHTMARE FOR OUR BUILDING

01:58:50.756 --> 01:58:52.425
TRADES AND OUR EMPLOYEES. AND,

01:58:52.492 --> 01:58:53.292
YOU KNOW, THIS IS OVER 100,

01:58:53.359 --> 01:58:55.127
ALMOST 100 YEARS OF PREVAILING

01:58:55.194 --> 01:58:56.729
WAGE THAT WE'VE ALWAYS

01:58:56.796 --> 01:58:57.830
RESPECTED. I KNOW MOST OF US,

01:58:57.897 --> 01:59:00.399
WHEN WE RUN FOR OFFICE, WE TALK

01:59:00.466 --> 01:59:01.033
ABOUT PREVAILING WAGE AND THE

01:59:01.100 --> 01:59:02.435
IMPORTANCE OF THAT. AND SO I'VE

01:59:02.502 --> 01:59:03.870
BEEN IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT FOR 21

01:59:03.936 --> 01:59:05.204
YEARS, AND WE'VE ALWAYS

01:59:05.271 --> 01:59:07.573
RESPECTED, YOU KNOW, OUR OUR

01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:09.408
QUALITY OF WORK THAT WE BRING TO

01:59:09.475 --> 01:59:11.210
OUR PROJECTS, OUR CONSTRUCTION

01:59:11.277 --> 01:59:12.979
BUILDING PROJECTS AND OUR

01:59:13.045 --> 01:59:14.380
COMMUNITIES. AND SO I WANT TO

01:59:14.447 --> 01:59:15.681
MAKE SURE THAT THAT PROCESS IS

01:59:15.748 --> 01:59:17.083
RESPECTED. AND AGAIN, I JUST

01:59:17.149 --> 01:59:19.018
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I

01:59:19.085 --> 01:59:19.619
UNDERSTAND IT MORE. SO I LOOK

01:59:19.685 --> 01:59:20.353
FORWARD TO ADDITIONAL

01:59:20.419 --> 01:59:21.487
CONVERSATIONS TODAY AND THANK

01:59:21.554 --> 01:59:22.722
AGAIN THE PROCESS OF THIS

01:59:22.788 --> 01:59:24.991
COMMITTEE. I KNOW THAT THE STATE

01:59:25.057 --> 01:59:26.292
HAS A LOT MORE THAN, THAN THAN

01:59:26.359 --> 01:59:27.026
THIS CONVERSATION, AND THAT'S

01:59:27.093 --> 01:59:29.128
WHY I WANT TO THANK THE PROCESS.

01:59:29.195 --> 01:59:30.663
BUT I DEFINITELY WANT TO ADD MY

01:59:30.730 --> 01:59:32.164
CONCERNS OF THIS PART. AND, YOU

01:59:32.231 --> 01:59:34.100
KNOW, WE DO SUCH A GREAT WORK IN

01:59:34.166 --> 01:59:35.668
COMMITTEE IN SPACE AND ADDING IT

01:59:35.735 --> 01:59:37.069
TO THE BUDGET TRAILER. IT'S A

01:59:37.136 --> 01:59:39.205
NEW PROJECT FOR ME, AND IT'S A

01:59:39.272 --> 01:59:40.373
LITTLE CONFUSING. SO I JUST WANT

01:59:40.439 --> 01:59:42.108
TO UNDERSTAND THAT. AND AGAIN,

01:59:42.174 --> 01:59:43.309
HOPEFULLY WE CAN IRON THIS OUT

01:59:43.376 --> 01:59:44.610
AND NOT AFFECT OUR OUR

01:59:44.677 --> 01:59:46.479
EMPLOYEES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU,

01:59:46.546 --> 01:59:48.214
MR. CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:59:48.281 --> 01:59:50.182
I APPRECIATE THAT. NOW WE ARE

01:59:50.249 --> 01:59:53.786
GOING TO GO TO MR. WARD. GREAT.

01:59:53.853 --> 01:59:56.822
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR, AND TO OUR

HARD WORK ON THIS. THERE'S A LOT

02:00:01.127 --> 02:00:02.328
HERE TO SIFT THROUGH AND

02:00:02.395 --> 02:00:04.230
CERTAINLY WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO

02:00:04.297 --> 02:00:05.498
AHEAD OF OUR VOTES THIS COMING

02:00:05.565 --> 02:00:07.400
WEEK. FIRST, I JUST WANTED TO

TRAILER BILLS WANT TO BE

ATTENTION AND THE NEEDS THAT WE

02:00:21.447 --> 02:00:22.114
HAVE SPECIFICALLY TO THE

02:00:22.181 --> 02:00:23.816
CHALLENGES THAT OUR COMMUNITY IS

02:00:23.883 --> 02:00:25.251
FACING IN AREAS OF HEALTH CARE

02:00:25.318 --> 02:00:26.786

COMMUNITY ARE FACING, AND I

02:00:34.527 --> 02:00:36.162
APPRECIATE OUR BUDGET COMMITTEE,

02:00:36.228 --> 02:00:37.597
ESPECIALLY WITH OUR CHAIR AND

02:00:37.663 --> 02:00:38.898
OUR BUDGET STAFF, FOR HEARING

02:00:38.965 --> 02:00:42.268
THOSE REQUESTS. I IS ALSO CHAIR

02:00:42.335 --> 02:00:44.437
OF THE ASSEMBLY'S ARTS,

02:00:44.503 --> 02:00:45.137
ENTERTAINMENT, SPORTS AND

02:00:45.204 --> 02:00:46.305
TOURISM COMMITTEE. WANT TO

02:00:46.372 --> 02:00:47.673
COMMEND AND THANK SEVERAL

02:00:47.740 --> 02:00:48.774
ELEMENTS HERE FOR, YOU KNOW, THE

02:00:48.841 --> 02:00:49.775
ASSISTANCE FOR OUR UPCOMING

02:00:49.842 --> 02:00:51.410
MAJOR SPORTS EVENTS IN THE GAMES

02:00:51.477 --> 02:00:52.745
AND THE PLANNING AND THE SAFETY

02:00:52.812 --> 02:00:54.847
THAT NEED TO GO INTO THOSE FOR

02:00:54.914 --> 02:00:56.115
THE RESPECTIVE HOME COMMUNITIES

02:00:56.182 --> 02:00:58.050
ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND FOR THE

02:00:58.117 --> 02:01:00.286
WORK ON THE FILM TAX CREDIT AS

02:01:00.353 --> 02:01:01.253
WELL. THAT HAS BEEN ITERATIVE

02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:02.922
AND ONGOING, BUT I THINK WE'LL

02:01:02.989 --> 02:01:04.156
COME TO A REALLY HEALTHY CLOSE

02:01:04.223 --> 02:01:06.192
HERE AS WE AS WE APPROVE THIS

02:01:06.258 --> 02:01:07.360
BILL COMING UP FORWARD IN THE

02:01:07.426 --> 02:01:10.429
COMING DAYS AS WELL. I WANT TO

02:01:10.496 --> 02:01:11.664
COMMEND AS WELL THE LEADERSHIP

02:01:11.731 --> 02:01:13.966
OF ASSEMBLYMAN RAMOS FOR HIS

02:01:14.033 --> 02:01:15.635
WORK ON MILITARY RETIREMENT

02:01:15.701 --> 02:01:16.602
EXCLUSION, AND THAT WE'RE ABLE

02:01:16.669 --> 02:01:17.670
TO MAKE SOME SIGNIFICANT

02:01:17.737 --> 02:01:19.271
PROGRESS HERE. IT'S NOT

02:01:19.338 --> 02:01:20.139
EVERYTHING THAT I THINK WE'D

02:01:20.206 --> 02:01:21.574
HOPED TO GET THROUGH. I THINK

02:01:21.641 --> 02:01:23.509
HIS EFFORT AND THE BILL AND THE

02:01:23.576 --> 02:01:25.177
WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON

02:01:25.244 --> 02:01:27.246
FOR SEVERAL YEARS, BUT IT IS A

02:01:27.313 --> 02:01:28.681
MEANINGFUL STEP TO HELP TO GET

02:01:28.748 --> 02:01:30.216
CALIFORNIA IN THE DIRECTION THAT

02:01:30.282 --> 02:01:31.484
IS BETTER IN ALIGNMENT WITH WHAT

02:01:31.550 --> 02:01:33.386
MOST STATES ARE ABLE TO DO FOR

02:01:33.452 --> 02:01:34.420
VETERANS AND THOSE THAT HAVE

02:01:34.487 --> 02:01:37.023
SERVED OUR COUNTRY AND THE

02:01:37.089 --> 02:01:38.824
DESERVEDNESS THAT THEY NEED FOR

02:01:38.891 --> 02:01:40.159
BEING ABLE TO HAVE, I THINK,

02:01:40.226 --> 02:01:41.927
PARITY IN THAT EXCLUSION AND

02:01:41.994 --> 02:01:43.062
IMPORTANTLY, TO BE ABLE TO KEEP

02:01:43.129 --> 02:01:44.296
THEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO WE

02:01:44.363 --> 02:01:45.965
DON'T LOSE THEM TO OTHER

02:01:46.032 --> 02:01:48.100
COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

02:01:48.167 --> 02:01:51.303
I'VE GOT ONE, TWO SPECIFIC

02:01:51.370 --> 02:01:52.838
QUESTIONS, AND THEN I WANT TO

02:01:52.905 --> 02:01:55.007
COME BACK AND CLOSE IN ON ON THE

02:01:55.074 --> 02:01:55.608
HOUSING CONVERSATION AS WELL.

02:01:55.675 --> 02:01:58.477
UNDER SB 128 AND THE

02:01:58.544 --> 02:02:00.312
TRANSPORTATION TRAILER BILL, I'M

02:02:00.379 --> 02:02:03.315
CURIOUS ABOUT THE DELAY OF AB

02:02:03.382 --> 02:02:06.452
THREE FROM 2021 THAT WOULD DELAY

02:02:06.519 --> 02:02:08.287
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

02:02:08.354 --> 02:02:11.524
ABILITY TO PROSECUTE SIDESHOW

02:02:11.590 --> 02:02:12.358
ACTIVITIES. THAT WAS SOMETHING

02:02:12.425 --> 02:02:13.693
THAT I REMEMBER VOTING ON AS

02:02:13.759 --> 02:02:15.528
WELL. AND I'M JUST CURIOUS WHY

02:02:15.594 --> 02:02:17.730
WE ARE EXTENDING THAT NOW TO

02:02:17.797 --> 02:02:19.799
2029. YEAH. AYMAN ALBIN,

02:02:19.865 --> 02:02:21.567
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SO AB

02:02:21.634 --> 02:02:23.002
THREE IS PROPOSED WOULD REQUIRE

02:02:23.069 --> 02:02:24.737
DMV TO BUILD A NEW IT SYSTEM

02:02:24.804 --> 02:02:27.306
OUTSIDE OF ITS CORE LEGACY

02:02:27.373 --> 02:02:28.374
SYSTEM AND RESULTING IN

02:02:28.441 --> 02:02:30.276
ADDITIONAL COSTS FOR THE MVA

02:02:30.342 --> 02:02:31.744
THAT COULDN'T BE SUPPORTED AT

02:02:31.811 --> 02:02:33.479
THE MOMENT. SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE

02:02:33.546 --> 02:02:34.280
PROPOSING THE DELAY RIGHT NOW,

02:02:34.346 --> 02:02:36.482
TO GIVE THEM TIME TO BUILD THEIR

02:02:36.549 --> 02:02:38.117
CORE OR BUILD THE REPLACEMENT OF

02:02:38.184 --> 02:02:39.752
THE CORE LEGACY SYSTEM, WHICH IS

02:02:39.819 --> 02:02:41.353
THROUGH DXP, AND THEN ADD ON

02:02:41.420 --> 02:02:43.823
THIS FUNCTIONALITY. HOW DOES

02:02:43.889 --> 02:02:47.193
THAT RELATE, THOUGH, TO

02:02:47.259 --> 02:02:48.661
ENFORCEMENT OF VIOLATIONS

02:02:48.728 --> 02:02:51.130
RELATED TO SIDESHOWS? CHAU

02:02:51.197 --> 02:02:52.465
FORBES ASSEMBLY BUDGET

02:02:52.531 --> 02:02:53.966
COMMITTEE. SO THEY NEED TO

02:02:54.033 --> 02:02:55.434
COMPLETE THE DATA SYSTEM

02:02:55.501 --> 02:02:56.802
UPGRADE, WHICH IS ON DRIVER'S

02:02:56.869 --> 02:02:57.970
LICENSES, BEFORE THEY CAN

02:02:58.037 --> 02:02:59.472
IMPLEMENT THE LEGISLATION. THERE

02:02:59.538 --> 02:03:01.140
WERE THREE PIECES OF LEGISLATION

02:03:01.207 --> 02:03:02.641
IN THAT TRAILER BILL THAT WERE

02:03:02.708 --> 02:03:03.476
DELAYED BECAUSE OF THAT DATA

02:03:03.542 --> 02:03:05.511
SYSTEM DELAY. SO IT'S NOT A

02:03:05.578 --> 02:03:07.313
POLICY DECISION. IT'S JUST THAT

02:03:07.379 --> 02:03:08.380
WE HAVEN'T COMPLETED THE TECH

02:03:08.447 --> 02:03:09.849
PROJECT THAT'S NEEDED BEFORE WE

02:03:09.915 --> 02:03:11.217
CAN FULLY IMPLEMENT THAT BILL.

02:03:11.283 --> 02:03:12.551
SINCE IT DEALS WITH DRIVER'S

02:03:12.618 --> 02:03:13.352
LICENSES, IT'S SUSPENDING THE

02:03:13.419 --> 02:03:14.854
PERSON'S DRIVER'S LICENSE IF

02:03:14.920 --> 02:03:16.956
THEY ARE INVOLVED IN SIDESHOW

02:03:17.022 --> 02:03:18.357
ACTIVITY. AND ADDITIONALLY,

02:03:18.424 --> 02:03:20.192
THERE WERE FOUR OTHER SIDESHOW

02:03:20.259 --> 02:03:21.761
BILLS THAT PASSED SINCE THEN

02:03:21.827 --> 02:03:23.229
THAT ARE FULLY IMPLEMENTED THAT

02:03:23.295 --> 02:03:25.030
ARE NOT IMPLICATED IN THAT DATA

02:03:25.097 --> 02:03:27.066
SYSTEM, THAT ARE FULLY ON TRACK.

02:03:27.133 --> 02:03:28.667
GOOD TO HEAR. OKAY. THANK YOU

02:03:28.734 --> 02:03:30.336
FOR THE CLARIFICATION. THAT'S AN

02:03:30.402 --> 02:03:33.506
IMPORTANT CONTEXT. BACK TO SB

02:03:33.572 --> 02:03:36.776
120 ON EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION.

02:03:36.842 --> 02:03:38.310
IT'S SOMETHING I WANT TO DIG

02:03:38.377 --> 02:03:39.712
INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE AS WELL.

02:03:39.779 --> 02:03:40.813
THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:42.982
HERE TO WORKERS AND INDUSTRY

02:03:43.048 --> 02:03:45.217
THAT IS SEVERELY IMPACTED. AND I

02:03:45.284 --> 02:03:46.685
WONDER IF YOU COULD JUST

02:03:46.752 --> 02:03:47.720
ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT MORE WHEN

02:03:47.787 --> 02:03:49.455
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW,

02:03:49.522 --> 02:03:51.991
ON ONE HAND, YOU KNOW, NOT

02:03:52.057 --> 02:03:52.992
SUSPENDING A COST OF LIVING

02:03:53.058 --> 02:03:55.227
ALLOWANCE, BUT ON ANOTHER HAND,

02:03:55.294 --> 02:03:56.962
PROVIDING A COST OF LIVING

02:03:57.029 --> 02:03:59.198
ALLOWANCE FOR CERTAIN CHILD CARE

02:03:59.265 --> 02:04:01.233
AND PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS. CAN YOU

02:04:01.300 --> 02:04:03.702
MAYBE JUST BROADLY SUMMARIZE THE

02:04:03.769 --> 02:04:05.704
IMPACT THAT WE HAVE TO WORKERS

02:04:05.771 --> 02:04:08.774
HERE THROUGH THIS TRAILER BILL,

02:04:08.841 --> 02:04:10.676
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SO THE

02:04:10.743 --> 02:04:12.378
CRUX OF THE ISSUE IS THAT THERE

02:04:12.444 --> 02:04:13.879
IS AN EXISTING REQUIREMENT UNDER

02:04:13.946 --> 02:04:15.381
STATE LAW FOR IMPLEMENTING THE

02:04:15.447 --> 02:04:17.082
COLON A VERY PARTICULAR WAY. IN

02:04:17.149 --> 02:04:18.684
PAST YEARS, THERE'S BEEN CONCERN

02:04:18.751 --> 02:04:19.552
EXPRESSED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND

02:04:19.618 --> 02:04:21.654
THE WAY CURRENT LAW DISTRIBUTES

02:04:21.720 --> 02:04:23.355
THE COLA FUNDING. AND SO WHAT

02:04:23.422 --> 02:04:24.657
THIS DOES IS IT SUSPENDS THE

02:04:24.723 --> 02:04:26.091
CURRENT LAW, COLA, AND ALLOCATES

02:04:26.158 --> 02:04:27.560
SORT OF A SIMILAR AMOUNT OF

02:04:27.626 --> 02:04:30.062
MONEY FOR COLA IN A NEW WAY THAT

02:04:30.129 --> 02:04:32.598
RESULTS IN MORE RATE INCREASES

02:04:32.665 --> 02:04:36.535
ACROSS PROVIDERS. OKAY. SO WHEN

02:04:36.602 --> 02:04:38.270
I GO BACK AND I TALK TO MY CHILD

02:04:38.337 --> 02:04:40.139
CARE WORKERS IN THE DISTRICT, WE

02:04:40.206 --> 02:04:41.307
COULD AFFIRMATIVELY SAY THAT WE

02:04:41.373 --> 02:04:43.075
ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SEE

02:04:43.142 --> 02:04:44.343
MODEST SUPPORT FOR THEM IN THE

02:04:44.410 --> 02:04:46.445
COMING YEAR BECAUSE OF THIS. I

02:04:46.512 --> 02:04:47.413
JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE ONE

02:04:47.479 --> 02:04:48.981
ELEMENT OF THIS TRAILER. BILL,

02:04:49.048 --> 02:04:50.549
CANCEL SOMETHING ELSE OUT THAT

02:04:50.616 --> 02:04:51.684
IS GOING TO SET THEM BACK

02:04:51.750 --> 02:04:52.585
FURTHER. SO ACROSS THE

02:04:52.651 --> 02:04:54.587
DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES

02:04:54.653 --> 02:04:55.221
AND CTE PROGRAMS, THERE'S ABOUT

02:04:55.287 --> 02:04:56.989
88 MILLION FOR COST OF LIVING

02:04:57.056 --> 02:04:57.890
ADJUSTMENTS IN THE BUDGET YEAR.

02:04:57.957 --> 02:05:01.427
OKAY. GREAT TO HEAR. AND THEN ON

02:05:01.493 --> 02:05:02.428
ONE OF THE BIGGER TOPICS OF

02:05:02.494 --> 02:05:03.495
CONVERSATION THAT'S GOING TO BE

02:05:03.562 --> 02:05:05.998
COMING UP, I WANT TO FOCUS ON SB

02:05:06.065 --> 02:05:07.233
130. BUT FIRST I WANTED TO JUMP

02:05:07.299 --> 02:05:09.268
AHEAD TO SB 131, WHICH WE

02:05:09.335 --> 02:05:10.769
HAVEN'T DISCUSSED MUCH HERE. I

02:05:10.836 --> 02:05:12.905
KNOW IT'S NOT IN PRINT, AND I'M

02:05:12.972 --> 02:05:14.740
WONDERING WHAT CONTENT WE CAN

02:05:14.807 --> 02:05:16.508
EXPECT TO SEE. GIVEN THAT

02:05:16.575 --> 02:05:17.509
ESPECIALLY WE ARE ALSO

02:05:17.576 --> 02:05:19.078
CONSIDERING DOUBLE JOINTING

02:05:19.144 --> 02:05:21.247
LANGUAGE ON FRIDAY THAT WOULD

02:05:21.313 --> 02:05:22.581
INVALIDATE THE ENTIRE BUDGET IF

02:05:22.648 --> 02:05:24.416
BOTH OF THESE ARE NOT APPROVED,

02:05:24.483 --> 02:05:25.918
BUT THIS MAY NOT BE IN PRINT

02:05:25.985 --> 02:05:28.020
UNTIL FRIDAY. AND WHILE I'M

02:05:28.087 --> 02:05:30.522
HIGHLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE NEED

02:05:30.589 --> 02:05:32.658
FOR HOUSING SUPPORT AND REFORMS,

02:05:32.725 --> 02:05:35.561
IT IS A LITTLE BIT TENUOUS. I

02:05:35.628 --> 02:05:38.130
THINK IN OUR RESPONSIBILITY, WE

02:05:38.197 --> 02:05:40.065
REALLY NEED TO GET SOME CLARITY

02:05:40.132 --> 02:05:41.267
ON WHAT'S COMING FORWARD BEFORE

02:05:41.333 --> 02:05:44.536
US. MEGAN TOKUNAGA, EBCLC

02:05:44.603 --> 02:05:48.173
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO WE CAN

02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:50.776
EXPECT AB, SB 131 TO INCLUDE TWO

02:05:50.843 --> 02:05:53.679
GENERAL COMPONENTS. ONE IS A

02:05:53.746 --> 02:05:55.481
FUTURE HOMELESS HOUSING

02:05:55.547 --> 02:05:57.049
ASSISTANCE PROGRAM ALLOCATION

02:05:57.116 --> 02:06:00.052
OKAY, WITH SOME ACCOUNTABILITY

02:06:00.119 --> 02:06:01.954
MEASURES OUTLINED. AND THE

02:06:02.021 --> 02:06:04.056
SECOND IS FURTHER CEQA

02:06:04.123 --> 02:06:06.292
STREAMLINING IN THE VEIN OF SB

02:06:06.358 --> 02:06:07.493
607, AS THE GOVERNOR IDENTIFIED

02:06:07.559 --> 02:06:09.094
AS A KEY PRIORITY BACK WHEN THE

02:06:09.161 --> 02:06:12.264
MAY REVISION WAS RELEASED. OKAY,

02:06:12.331 --> 02:06:14.466
SO THAT'S SB 607 COMPONENT. I'M

02:06:14.533 --> 02:06:15.968
AWARE OF THE HAP CONVERSATION

02:06:16.035 --> 02:06:18.871
BECAUSE THAT ALSO IS REFLECTED

02:06:18.938 --> 02:06:22.107
IN SB 102. IS THAT CORRECT? IT

02:06:22.174 --> 02:06:24.276
WAS IT WAS ONE OF THESE ONE OF

02:06:24.343 --> 02:06:26.745
THESE, IF I CAN CLARIFY, THOSE

02:06:26.812 --> 02:06:27.479
ARE THE TWO HOUSING ELEMENTS

02:06:27.546 --> 02:06:28.280
THAT WE'RE EXPECTING AS PART OF

02:06:28.347 --> 02:06:30.416
THAT FUTURE LEGISLATION. GOT IT

02:06:30.482 --> 02:06:32.851
FOR SB 131. GOT IT. SO ON ON SB

02:06:32.918 --> 02:06:34.353
130, YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF

02:06:34.420 --> 02:06:35.688
INFORMATION NOW THAT IS COMING

02:06:35.754 --> 02:06:37.323
BEFORE US AS WELL THAT WE NEED

02:06:37.389 --> 02:06:38.924
TO RECONCILE AND DECIDE WHETHER

02:06:38.991 --> 02:06:41.193
OR NOT THE FACTS ARE RIGHT. I

02:06:41.260 --> 02:06:42.394
APPRECIATE, AND I THINK I ALIGN

02:06:42.461 --> 02:06:43.762
MY COMMENTS VERY STRONGLY WITH

02:06:43.829 --> 02:06:45.831
SOME MEMBER, LEE AND OTHERS.

02:06:45.898 --> 02:06:47.666
THAT ONE. THIS SEEMS VERY

02:06:47.733 --> 02:06:50.569
REFLECTIVE OF AB 609, WHICH THE

02:06:50.636 --> 02:06:52.638
ASSEMBLY HAS ALREADY PASSED

02:06:52.705 --> 02:06:54.473
OVERWHELMINGLY. AND IS THERE

02:06:54.540 --> 02:06:57.710
ANYTHING ELSE IN ADDITION TO THE

02:06:57.776 --> 02:06:59.211
POLICY AND THE SUBSTANCE THAT IS

02:06:59.278 --> 02:07:01.313
HERE IN SB 130 THAT WAS NOT

02:07:01.380 --> 02:07:05.250
CONSIDERED BY AB 609 WITH

02:07:05.317 --> 02:07:07.086
RESPECT TO THE CEQA EXEMPTIONS?

02:07:07.152 --> 02:07:08.187
YEAH. GENEVIEVE MORALES,

02:07:08.253 --> 02:07:09.321
ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE, THERE

02:07:09.388 --> 02:07:10.422
ARE THE TWO COMPONENTS THAT ARE

02:07:10.489 --> 02:07:12.291
DIFFERENT FROM 609 THAT RAN

02:07:12.358 --> 02:07:14.360
THROUGH THE POLICY COMMITTEE AND

02:07:14.426 --> 02:07:15.728
WAS VOTED OFF THE FLOOR. AND

02:07:15.794 --> 02:07:17.329
WHAT YOU SEE IN 130 AND THE TWO

02:07:17.396 --> 02:07:19.365
ELEMENTS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IS

02:07:19.431 --> 02:07:20.232
THE PREVAILING WAGES AND ALSO

02:07:20.299 --> 02:07:22.201
THE TRIBAL CONSULTATION THAT'S

02:07:22.267 --> 02:07:23.802
INCLUDED IN THERE. SO THOSE ARE

02:07:23.869 --> 02:07:25.137
THE TWO DIFFERENCES THAT WERE

02:07:25.204 --> 02:07:26.171
NEGOTIATED AFTER THE BILL WENT

02:07:26.238 --> 02:07:28.340
OFF OF THE FLOOR THAT ARE

02:07:28.407 --> 02:07:29.575
INCLUDED IN SB 130, THE POLICY

02:07:29.641 --> 02:07:30.442
CONSIDERATION. THE EXEMPTION IS

02:07:30.509 --> 02:07:32.244
CONSISTENT WITH 609. YES. AND

02:07:32.311 --> 02:07:33.445
THAT YOU'VE ALREADY ANSWERED THE

02:07:33.512 --> 02:07:35.047
QUESTION AS WELL TO THAT WITH

02:07:35.114 --> 02:07:36.081
THE NOTWITHSTANDING CLAUSE IN

02:07:36.148 --> 02:07:38.484
THIS LANGUAGE HERE, TOO, THAT WE

02:07:38.550 --> 02:07:39.885
COULD AFFIRMATIVELY SAY THAT

02:07:39.952 --> 02:07:41.620
THIS IS NOT GOING TO EXEMPT

02:07:41.687 --> 02:07:43.455
EXISTING CRITERIA FOR PREVAILING

02:07:43.522 --> 02:07:45.457
WAGE AND OTHER EXISTING PROGRAMS

02:07:45.524 --> 02:07:48.093
THAT ARE OUT THERE, BUT RATHER

02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:49.228
FOR ADDITIONAL PROJECTS HERE

02:07:49.294 --> 02:07:50.596
THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THIS

02:07:50.662 --> 02:07:52.364
NEW CEQA EXEMPTION, THAT WE ARE

02:07:52.431 --> 02:07:54.199
LIFTING THE FLOOR FOR PREVAILING

02:07:54.266 --> 02:07:55.768
WAGES THAT DON'T EXIST TODAY.

02:07:55.834 --> 02:07:58.137
WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE

02:07:58.203 --> 02:07:59.972
DIALING BACK ANY OTHER EXISTING

02:08:00.039 --> 02:08:01.140
PREVAILING WAGE REQUIREMENTS IN

02:08:01.206 --> 02:08:03.575
CERTAIN COUNTIES THAT ARE

02:08:03.642 --> 02:08:04.977
CURRENTLY AT A MORE APPROPRIATE

02:08:05.044 --> 02:08:07.513
AND HIGHER LEVEL. YEAH, WE'RE WE

02:08:07.579 --> 02:08:09.715
THE INTENT OF THAT IS TO SET

02:08:09.782 --> 02:08:10.716
FLOORS FOR MARKET RATE

02:08:10.783 --> 02:08:13.419
DEVELOPMENT THAT DON'T EXIST

02:08:13.485 --> 02:08:16.889
CURRENTLY AND THAT ALSO TO TRY

02:08:16.955 --> 02:08:18.390
TO UNIONIZE WHERE THERE HAVE

02:08:18.457 --> 02:08:20.559
BEEN UNIONS BEFORE TO MAKE SURE

02:08:20.626 --> 02:08:22.361
THAT WHEN WE MOVE FORWARD, ALL

02:08:22.428 --> 02:08:24.063
OF THESE GOOD COMPONENTS THAT WE

02:08:24.129 --> 02:08:27.433
HAVE ARE IN THAT THAT APPLY TO

02:08:27.499 --> 02:08:28.834
PREVAILING WAGES ARE STARTED IN

02:08:28.901 --> 02:08:30.969
THAT MARKET RATE SPACE. AND WHAT

02:08:31.036 --> 02:08:33.105
IS THE RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS

02:08:33.172 --> 02:08:37.009
ABOUT ENFORCEMENT OF THIS, OF

02:08:37.076 --> 02:08:39.211
THESE NEW PROVISIONS THAT IT'S

02:08:39.278 --> 02:08:40.746
BEEN ALLEGED THAT THAT THAT

02:08:40.813 --> 02:08:44.616
THERE'S NO THERE'S A BROAD

02:08:44.683 --> 02:08:46.485
INABILITY FOR US TO BE ABLE TO

02:08:46.552 --> 02:08:48.554
ENFORCE AND TRACK COMPLIANCE

02:08:48.620 --> 02:08:50.756
WITH THESE WITH WITH THIS LEVEL

02:08:50.823 --> 02:08:52.624
OF PREVAILING WAGE REQUIREMENTS.

02:08:52.691 --> 02:08:54.793
I THINK, I THINK THE GOAL IS TO

02:08:54.860 --> 02:08:56.528
GET TO THAT ENFORCEMENT IN THIS

02:08:56.595 --> 02:08:58.464
SPACE. AND I WOULD HAVE TO GET

02:08:58.530 --> 02:09:00.466
BACK TO YOU ON THE SPECIFIC

02:09:00.532 --> 02:09:01.300
REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE THERE, IF

02:09:01.366 --> 02:09:02.868
THEY EXIST IN THIS TRAILER BILL

02:09:02.935 --> 02:09:04.103
AND ON THE ENFORCEMENT PIECE OF

02:09:04.169 --> 02:09:06.271
IT, BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IT OFF

02:09:06.338 --> 02:09:07.539
THE TOP OF MY HEAD. OKAY. I

02:09:07.606 --> 02:09:09.141
THINK THESE ARE ALL IMPORTANT

02:09:09.208 --> 02:09:11.643
DOTS TO CONNECT AS WELL, TO MAKE

02:09:11.710 --> 02:09:12.578
SURE THAT WE'RE ALL OPERATING

02:09:12.644 --> 02:09:14.146
OFF OF SIMILAR FACTS. BUT I

02:09:14.213 --> 02:09:14.713
REMAIN VERY INTERESTED IN

02:09:14.780 --> 02:09:15.447
RECEIVING A LOT OF THIS

02:09:15.514 --> 02:09:17.382
INFORMATION TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:09:17.449 --> 02:09:18.517
WE'RE GETTING THIS RIGHT. WE

02:09:18.584 --> 02:09:19.318
KNOW SOMETIMES THINGS CAN GO

02:09:19.384 --> 02:09:21.353
AWRY IN A BUDGET TRAILER BILL.

02:09:21.420 --> 02:09:23.188
AND THIS IS IMPORTANT. IT IS

02:09:23.255 --> 02:09:24.456
IMPORTANT TO GET RIGHT. AND IT

02:09:24.523 --> 02:09:26.058
WOULD HAVE MAJOR IMPACT AS WELL

02:09:26.125 --> 02:09:27.459
ON OUR ABILITY TO PRODUCE MORE

02:09:27.526 --> 02:09:28.961
HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES HERE IN

02:09:29.027 --> 02:09:30.329
CALIFORNIA. BUT I THINK THAT

02:09:30.395 --> 02:09:31.530
WE'RE GOING TO BE ALL HANDS ON

02:09:31.597 --> 02:09:33.966
DECK RIGHT NOW, TRYING TO MAKE

02:09:34.032 --> 02:09:35.734
SURE THAT WE DOT ALL OF OUR I'S

02:09:35.801 --> 02:09:37.202
ACROSS ALL OF OUR T'S AND THAT

02:09:37.269 --> 02:09:38.537
WE'RE FAITHFUL, I THINK, TO THE

02:09:38.604 --> 02:09:40.038
PRINCIPLES THAT I THINK ALL OF

02:09:40.105 --> 02:09:42.241
US ARE TRYING TO BE ABLE TO

02:09:42.307 --> 02:09:44.209
EXERCISE HERE THROUGH THESE

02:09:44.276 --> 02:09:44.977
DECISIONS. SO I WANT TO THANK

02:09:45.043 --> 02:09:46.612
YOU FOR A LOT OF THIS HARD WORK.

02:09:46.678 --> 02:09:48.380
I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH

02:09:48.447 --> 02:09:49.848
YOU IN THE COMING DAYS. THANK

02:09:49.915 --> 02:09:51.250
YOU VERY MUCH. I THINK WE'RE

02:09:51.316 --> 02:09:52.384
GOING TO GO ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:09:52.451 --> 02:09:54.486
BENNETT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

02:09:54.553 --> 02:09:55.854
CHAIR. GABRIEL. I'LL BE VERY

02:09:55.921 --> 02:09:58.056
BRIEF. WE'VE ALREADY REACHED A

02:09:58.123 --> 02:09:59.925
TIPPING POINT WHEN IT COMES TO

02:09:59.992 --> 02:10:01.693
WILDFIRES AS A RESULT OF CLIMATE

02:10:01.760 --> 02:10:04.129
CHANGE. BUT THERE WILL COME A

02:10:04.196 --> 02:10:06.598
MOMENT WHEN IN CALIFORNIA, WE

02:10:06.665 --> 02:10:08.167
WILL REACH A TIPPING POINT WHERE

02:10:08.233 --> 02:10:10.969
WE WILL HAVE THE YOUNGER

02:10:11.036 --> 02:10:13.539
GENERATION SAYING TO US, DID YOU

02:10:13.605 --> 02:10:14.873
DO ENOUGH? DID WE DO OUR PART?

02:10:14.940 --> 02:10:17.543
DID WE DO OUR SHARE TO TRY TO

02:10:17.609 --> 02:10:18.977
ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE? AND I

02:10:19.044 --> 02:10:20.812
THINK THAT THE NUMBER ONE

02:10:20.879 --> 02:10:22.147
ACTIVITY THAT WE'RE DOING IN

02:10:22.214 --> 02:10:23.982
CALIFORNIA TO TRY TO DO THAT IS

02:10:24.049 --> 02:10:26.151
WITH A CAP AND TRADE FUND AND

02:10:26.218 --> 02:10:27.953
THE REVENUES THAT ARE GENERATED

02:10:28.020 --> 02:10:30.989
FROM THAT. THE FUNDS, AS WE

02:10:31.056 --> 02:10:34.593
REFER THEM, TO THE EXTENT THAT

02:10:34.660 --> 02:10:36.728
THOSE THAT THE CAP AND TRADE

02:10:36.795 --> 02:10:39.665
PROGRAM AND THE FUNDS COLLECTED

02:10:39.731 --> 02:10:42.701
FROM THAT ARE THE MAJOR EFFORT

02:10:42.768 --> 02:10:45.103
THAT CALIFORNIA IS MAKING TO DO

02:10:45.170 --> 02:10:47.906
OUR SHARE TO ADDRESS CLIMATE

02:10:47.973 --> 02:10:50.175
CHANGE AND TO ADDRESS CARBON

02:10:50.242 --> 02:10:51.610
EMISSIONS TO THE EXTENT THAT

02:10:51.677 --> 02:10:54.780
THAT IS BEING UNDERMINED BY

02:10:54.846 --> 02:10:58.016
MOVING THOSE FUNDS TO FUND THE

02:10:58.083 --> 02:10:59.384
NORMAL OPERATIONS AND ACTIVITIES

02:10:59.451 --> 02:11:02.387
OF CAL FIRE. I THINK IT REDUCES

02:11:02.454 --> 02:11:04.223
THE ABILITY FOR US TO SAY WE

02:11:04.289 --> 02:11:05.958
HAVE DONE THE APPROPRIATE THINGS

02:11:06.024 --> 02:11:07.859
AND TAKEN THE APPROPRIATE STEPS.

02:11:07.926 --> 02:11:09.528
SO I LOOK FORWARD AND I WANT TO

02:11:09.595 --> 02:11:11.330
JUST TRY TO HIGHLIGHT THE FACT

02:11:11.396 --> 02:11:17.502
THAT WE DO HAVE A $1.25 BILLION

02:11:17.569 --> 02:11:22.107
GOING INTO COMING FROM THE FUND

02:11:22.174 --> 02:11:23.909
TO FUND THE NORMAL OPERATIONS OF

02:11:23.976 --> 02:11:25.811
CAL FIRE, AND WE SHOULD AS

02:11:25.877 --> 02:11:28.714
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE REVERSE THAT

02:11:28.780 --> 02:11:31.216
AND MOVE BACK TO NORMAL

02:11:31.283 --> 02:11:33.085
OPERATIONS WHERE WE FUND CAL

02:11:33.151 --> 02:11:35.087
FIRE, WHICH IS AN ESSENTIAL

02:11:35.153 --> 02:11:36.488
CALIFORNIA SERVICE THROUGH THE

02:11:36.555 --> 02:11:38.757
GENERAL FUND. AND WE DO THE

02:11:38.824 --> 02:11:39.758
APPROPRIATE ACTIVITIES SO THAT

02:11:39.825 --> 02:11:41.360
WE CAN LOOK OUR GRANDCHILDREN IN

02:11:41.426 --> 02:11:43.795
THE FACE AND SAY, WHILE WE HAD

02:11:43.862 --> 02:11:45.897
THE ABILITY TO DO SOMETHING, WE

02:11:45.964 --> 02:11:48.867
DID DO WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN

02:11:48.934 --> 02:11:50.969
DOING TO TRY TO PROTECT US FROM

02:11:51.036 --> 02:11:52.437
THE RAVAGES OF CLIMATE CHANGE.

02:11:52.504 --> 02:11:54.606
IF CALIFORNIA DOESN'T DO OUR

02:11:54.673 --> 02:11:56.608
SHARE, WE CAN'T EXERCISE WORLD

02:11:56.675 --> 02:11:58.477
LEADERSHIP TO TRY TO HAVE OTHER

02:11:58.543 --> 02:12:00.479
PEOPLE DO THEIR SHARE. THANK YOU

02:12:00.545 --> 02:12:06.485

ASSEMBLYMEMBER LACKEY. THANK

02:12:09.821 --> 02:12:12.224
YOU, MR. CHAIR. IT DOES LOOK

02:12:12.291 --> 02:12:14.059
LIKE THERE'S LESS FUNDING IN THE

02:12:14.126 --> 02:12:15.527
BUDGET NOW DEDICATED TO

02:12:15.594 --> 02:12:17.362
IMPLEMENTING THE VOTERS WILL, AS

02:12:17.429 --> 02:12:19.798
IT RELATES TO PROPOSITION 36.

02:12:19.865 --> 02:12:21.600
AND I JUST WONDERED IN GENERAL

02:12:21.667 --> 02:12:24.136
TERMS, HOW MUCH DOES THIS BUDGET

02:12:24.202 --> 02:12:25.637
PACKAGE INCLUDE AND FOR WHAT

02:12:25.704 --> 02:12:43.588
PROGRAMS ARE BEING ADDRESSED?

02:12:46.191 --> 02:12:48.226
HØI ASSEMBLYMEMBER JENNIFER KIM

02:12:48.293 --> 02:12:50.028
WITH THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET

02:12:50.095 --> 02:12:53.598
COMMITTEE, THERE'S $50 MILLION

02:12:53.665 --> 02:12:55.233
FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FOR GRANTS

02:12:55.300 --> 02:12:57.569
TO THE COUNTIES. THERE'S AN

02:12:57.636 --> 02:12:59.504
ADDITIONAL $20 MILLION FOR

02:12:59.571 --> 02:13:01.506
COURTS TO ADDRESS JUDICIAL

02:13:01.573 --> 02:13:03.408
WORKLOAD, AND THERE'S $15

02:13:03.475 --> 02:13:05.410
MILLION FOR PRETRIAL SERVICES

02:13:05.477 --> 02:13:07.679
THAT PRIMARILY WILL SUPPORT

02:13:07.746 --> 02:13:09.614
PROBATION. OKAY. SO IN TOTAL,

02:13:09.681 --> 02:13:13.018
WHAT DOES THAT ABOUT AMOUNT TO

02:13:13.085 --> 02:13:14.753
APPROXIMATELY $85 MILLION, AS

02:13:14.820 --> 02:13:17.189
OPPOSED TO THE PROPOSED 400

02:13:17.255 --> 02:13:19.191
MILLION THAT WAS WE WERE TOLD IT

02:13:19.257 --> 02:13:21.393
WOULD TAKE TO FUND THIS THIS

02:13:21.460 --> 02:13:22.828
PROPOSITION. I DON'T EXPECT YOU

02:13:22.894 --> 02:13:24.629
TO MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT THAT.

02:13:24.696 --> 02:13:26.465
THAT'S MY JOB. BUT I WILL TELL

02:13:26.531 --> 02:13:28.066

02:13:28.133 --> 02:13:29.634
DISAPPOINTING. AND FINALLY, MY

02:13:29.701 --> 02:13:31.737
LAST POINT IS WHAT, IF ANYTHING,

DOES THIS NEGOTIATED BUDGET

02:13:34.339 --> 02:13:37.909
PACKAGE DO TO REDUCE GAS PRICES

02:13:37.976 --> 02:13:40.479
AND AVOID THE $8 GALLON GAS

02:13:40.545 --> 02:13:43.348
PRICE THAT WE BELIEVE IS COMING?

02:13:43.415 --> 02:14:01.366
IS THERE ANYTHING?

02:14:01.433 --> 02:14:02.401

IF ANYTHING, DOES THIS

02:14:08.907 --> 02:14:10.242
NEGOTIATED BUDGET PACKAGE DO TO

02:14:10.308 --> 02:14:12.811
REDUCE GAS PRICES AND AVOID THE

02:14:12.878 --> 02:14:16.882
$8 GALLON PRICE THAT'S LOOMING?

02:14:16.948 --> 02:14:18.216
THERE'S NOTHING IN THE BUDGET

02:14:18.283 --> 02:14:19.418
RIGHT NOW THAT ADDRESSES THAT.

02:14:19.484 --> 02:14:22.154
ZERO. THANK YOU. THAT'S ALL I

02:14:22.220 --> 02:14:25.690
GOT. OKAY, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:14:31.029 --> 02:14:32.964
AND I WANT TO ALIGN THEM WITH

02:14:33.031 --> 02:14:34.633
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE

02:14:34.699 --> 02:14:35.333
ALREADY BEEN SAID AND MAYBE JUST

02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:37.335
BE VERY DIRECT ABOUT IT. I

02:14:37.402 --> 02:14:39.070
DIDN'T COME TO SACRAMENTO TO CUT

02:14:39.137 --> 02:14:40.906
PEOPLE'S WAGES. I DIDN'T SIT

02:14:40.972 --> 02:14:42.274
THROUGH MONTHS OF BUDGET

02:14:42.340 --> 02:14:43.508
COMMITTEE HEARINGS TALKING ABOUT

02:14:43.575 --> 02:14:44.776
HOW TO PRESERVE OUR SOCIAL

02:14:44.843 --> 02:14:46.311
SAFETY NET, TO THEN, AT THE 11TH

02:14:46.378 --> 02:14:47.779
HOUR, POTENTIALLY KICK MORE

02:14:47.846 --> 02:14:50.282
PEOPLE ON TO IT. AND WHEN WE

TALK ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:14:51.850 --> 02:14:53.485
AND THE HOUSING CRISIS IN THE

02:14:53.552 --> 02:14:55.520
STATE, WE CAN'T SOLVE THAT

02:14:55.587 --> 02:14:57.122
PROBLEM. IF THE PEOPLE BUILDING

02:14:57.189 --> 02:14:59.691
THE HOUSES ARE THE ONES WHO

02:14:59.758 --> 02:15:01.426
QUALIFY FOR THEM. I KNOW THAT

02:15:01.493 --> 02:15:02.928
THERE'S CONTINUED CONVERSATION

02:15:02.994 --> 02:15:04.963
THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. I'M

02:15:05.030 --> 02:15:06.164
HEARING THAT PERHAPS THERE'S

02:15:06.231 --> 02:15:07.933
SOME MISINFORMATION ABOUT IT.

02:15:07.999 --> 02:15:09.034
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU

02:15:09.100 --> 02:15:10.502
DROP A BILL LIKE THIS AT THE

02:15:10.569 --> 02:15:11.603
LAST MINUTE AND DON'T INVOLVE

02:15:11.670 --> 02:15:13.672
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IMPACTED. SO

02:15:13.738 --> 02:15:15.040
IF WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT THIS

02:15:15.106 --> 02:15:16.942
IS GOING TO BE REALLY GOOD FOR

02:15:17.008 --> 02:15:18.176
CALIFORNIA'S WORKERS, BUT THE

02:15:18.243 --> 02:15:19.978
LABOR FED AND THE BUILDING

02:15:20.045 --> 02:15:21.279
TRADES WEREN'T INVITED TO THE

02:15:21.346 --> 02:15:22.647

INSTEAD HAVE CONCERNS AND SAY

02:15:23.849 --> 02:15:25.250
THAT IT'S GOING TO IMPACT THEIR

02:15:25.317 --> 02:15:26.518
WORKERS, THEN I DON'T BELIEVE

02:15:26.585 --> 02:15:28.920
YOU. SO SPEND SOME TIME, HAVE

02:15:28.987 --> 02:15:30.755
THOSE CONVERSATIONS. DON'T TRY

02:15:30.822 --> 02:15:32.624
TO PUT MEMBERS IN A POSITION

02:15:32.691 --> 02:15:33.825
WHERE WE HAVE TO DECIDE BETWEEN

02:15:33.892 --> 02:15:35.293
PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD HOUSING

02:15:35.360 --> 02:15:37.195
AND PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD

02:15:37.262 --> 02:15:38.897
GROCERIES. AND LET'S ACTUALLY

02:15:38.964 --> 02:15:41.032

TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT

02:16:37.188 --> 02:16:38.690
KICKED OFF MEDI-CAL BECAUSE THEY

02:16:38.757 --> 02:16:41.192

THAT THEY ARE GETTING THAT HELP

02:16:55.941 --> 02:16:58.276
IS IMPORTANT THAT WE DO NOT EVER

LEAVE THEM OUT. TITLE TEN FAMILY

02:17:02.380 --> 02:17:04.082

BURNING FOR 20 YEARS AND IS

02:17:17.896 --> 02:17:23.368
MAKING THEM SICK. AND YOU KNOW,

PROP 36 FUNDING. DISAPPOINTED TO

SEE THAT THAT WAS REDUCED. AND

02:17:30.108 --> 02:17:31.443
YOU KNOW, I KNOW THAT THIS IS

02:17:31.509 --> 02:17:33.478
NOT A PERFECT BUDGET. BUT I ALSO

02:17:33.545 --> 02:17:35.914
WANT TO, YOU KNOW, IN A

02:17:35.981 --> 02:17:38.416
DIFFICULT YEAR. BUT I ALSO WANT

02:17:38.483 --> 02:17:40.518
TO SHARE THE CONCERNS OF MY

02:17:40.585 --> 02:17:42.387
COLLEAGUE, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:17:42.454 --> 02:17:44.222
ROGERS JUST EXPRESSED. AND, YOU

02:17:44.289 --> 02:17:45.624
KNOW, AS SOMEONE WHO WORKED FOR

02:17:45.690 --> 02:17:47.792
20 YEARS IN THE LABOR MOVEMENT

02:17:47.859 --> 02:17:49.995
AND HAS FOUGHT FOR PREVAILING

02:17:50.061 --> 02:17:52.130
WAGE, YOU KNOW, THIS IS ONE OF

02:17:52.197 --> 02:17:54.299
THE REASONS WE DON'T LIKE TO DO

02:17:54.366 --> 02:17:56.801
POLICY IN THE BUDGET. AND IT'S

02:17:56.868 --> 02:17:59.337
INCREDIBLY PROBLEMATIC THAT THE

02:17:59.404 --> 02:18:00.772
TRADES HAVE NOT BEEN AT THE

02:18:00.839 --> 02:18:03.308
TABLE IN THIS CONVERSATION, AND

02:18:03.375 --> 02:18:06.177
IT DOES NOT FEEL LIKE THERE ARE

02:18:06.244 --> 02:18:08.213
SAFEGUARDS. I YOU KNOW, WE'VE

02:18:08.279 --> 02:18:10.749
ALL FOUGHT AND SUPPORTED LIFTING

02:18:10.815 --> 02:18:13.284
THE FLOOR, FIGHTING FOR MINIMUM

02:18:13.351 --> 02:18:15.153
WAGES, ALL OF THOSE THINGS. BUT

02:18:15.220 --> 02:18:16.888
THE OTHER PIECES MAKE IT FEEL

02:18:16.955 --> 02:18:20.392
VERY, VERY TENUOUS WHEN, YOU

02:18:20.458 --> 02:18:21.893
KNOW, IF THERE'S A REQUIREMENT

02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:25.130
FOR HEALTH CARE, DO WE KNOW WHAT

02:18:25.196 --> 02:18:26.431
STANDARD OF HEALTH CARE THAT

02:18:26.498 --> 02:18:27.666
THERE'S A REQUIREMENT FOR? HOW

02:18:27.732 --> 02:18:29.467
MUCH IS THE OUT-OF-POCKET GOING

02:18:29.534 --> 02:18:31.269
TO BE? I MEAN, IT COULD BE A

02:18:31.336 --> 02:18:32.971
SITUATION WHERE YOU'RE GETTING

02:18:33.038 --> 02:18:34.539
$40 AN HOUR, BUT YOU'RE HAVING

02:18:34.606 --> 02:18:35.573
TO PAY SO MUCH FOR HEALTHCARE,

02:18:35.640 --> 02:18:37.876
YOU'RE BARELY MAKING MORE THAN A

02:18:37.942 --> 02:18:41.413
FAST FOOD WORKER. AND THE WHOLE

02:18:41.479 --> 02:18:43.515
POINT OF, YOU KNOW, US MAKING

02:18:43.581 --> 02:18:44.849
SURE THAT THERE ARE LIVING AND

02:18:44.916 --> 02:18:47.419
PREVAILING WAGES FOR PEOPLE IN

02:18:47.485 --> 02:18:48.553
CONSTRUCTION IS THAT THEY CAN

02:18:48.620 --> 02:18:49.721
ACTUALLY AFFORD THE HOUSING THAT

02:18:49.788 --> 02:18:52.824
THEY'RE BUILDING. AND SO, YOU

02:18:52.891 --> 02:18:55.360
KNOW, I, I SHARE THE CONCERNS

02:18:55.427 --> 02:18:56.628
THAT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED TODAY.

02:18:56.695 --> 02:18:58.563
I THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT THE

02:18:58.630 --> 02:19:00.398
TRADES ARE IN THIS CONVERSATION

02:19:00.465 --> 02:19:02.200
AND THAT WE GO BACK TO WORK ON

02:19:02.267 --> 02:19:05.737
THIS PIECE BECAUSE WE CANNOT DO

02:19:05.804 --> 02:19:08.306
SOMETHING THAT REALLY UNDERCUTS

02:19:08.373 --> 02:19:11.242
WHERE WHERE FOLKS ARE GOING TO

02:19:11.309 --> 02:19:13.111
BE IN TERMS OF PREVAILING WAGES

02:19:13.178 --> 02:19:14.446
AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY CAN

02:19:14.512 --> 02:19:16.715
PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. IN MY

02:19:16.781 --> 02:19:17.415
DISTRICT ALREADY, PEOPLE ARE

02:19:17.482 --> 02:19:19.217
HAVING TO LIVE SO FAR AWAY FROM

02:19:19.284 --> 02:19:20.185
WHERE THEY'RE WORKING AND

02:19:20.251 --> 02:19:22.454
DRIVING, YOU KNOW, ONE AND TWO

02:19:22.520 --> 02:19:25.290
OR MORE HOURS A DAY JUST TO GET

02:19:25.356 --> 02:19:26.524
TO WORK AND THEN HAVING TO DO

02:19:26.591 --> 02:19:28.860
THE SAME THING AGAIN. MORE THAN

02:19:28.927 --> 02:19:30.428
HALF OF THEIR DAYS SOMETIMES

02:19:30.495 --> 02:19:32.530
SPENT IN THE CAR TO DRIVE

02:19:32.597 --> 02:19:33.431
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO

02:19:33.498 --> 02:19:35.333
LIVE IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT

02:19:35.400 --> 02:19:36.868
THEY'RE WORKING IN. AND, YOU

02:19:36.935 --> 02:19:39.504
KNOW, THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS

02:19:39.571 --> 02:19:40.105
THAT WE HAVE AN AFFORDABILITY

02:19:40.171 --> 02:19:43.308
CRISIS. AND WE I APPRECIATE THAT

02:19:43.375 --> 02:19:45.143
THERE'S AN EFFORT TO KIND OF BE

02:19:45.210 --> 02:19:47.212
A PART OF THAT SOLUTION, BUT IT

02:19:47.278 --> 02:19:48.747
DOES NOT FEEL LIKE, AT LEAST IN

02:19:48.813 --> 02:19:50.148
TERMS OF CLARITY AND

02:19:50.215 --> 02:19:51.683
UNDERSTANDING, THAT WE ARE THERE

02:19:51.750 --> 02:19:54.753
YET. AND I HOPE THAT, YOU KNOW,

02:19:54.819 --> 02:19:57.922
THERE ARE ARE IMPORTANT

02:19:57.989 --> 02:19:58.723
CONVERSATIONS THAT INCLUDE ALL

02:19:58.790 --> 02:20:00.291
OF THE VOICES, AND ESPECIALLY

02:20:00.358 --> 02:20:02.627
THOSE WHO ARE GOING TO BE

02:20:02.694 --> 02:20:03.728
IMPACTED BY THIS IN FIGURING OUT

02:20:03.795 --> 02:20:06.264
THE RIGHT BALANCE AND MAKING

02:20:06.331 --> 02:20:08.500
SURE THAT WE GET IT RIGHT. SO I

02:20:08.566 --> 02:20:11.302
WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

02:20:11.369 --> 02:20:12.403

JUST WANT TO ADD MY VOICE TO THE

02:20:24.783 --> 02:20:26.417
QUESTIONS THAT MEMBERS HAVE HAD

02:20:26.484 --> 02:20:28.720
ABOUT THE SECTIONS OF 130

02:20:28.787 --> 02:20:30.021
RELATING TO THE TRADES AND THE

02:20:30.088 --> 02:20:31.222
PREVAILING WAGE ISSUES. YOU

02:20:31.289 --> 02:20:32.657
KNOW, THERE'S A LOT OF POLICY

02:20:32.724 --> 02:20:36.494
THAT HAS TO BE CONFIRMED IN THE

02:20:36.561 --> 02:20:37.996
CONVERSATIONS THAT MEMBERS HAVE

02:20:38.062 --> 02:20:38.963
RAISED, THE QUESTIONS THAT

02:20:39.030 --> 02:20:41.266
MEMBERS HAVE RAISED ABOUT THE

02:20:41.332 --> 02:20:42.400
APPLICABILITY OF THIS, IS IT

02:20:42.467 --> 02:20:43.868
REALLY GOING TO APPLY TO NEW

02:20:43.935 --> 02:20:45.336
PROJECTS THAT HAVEN'T PREVIOUSLY

02:20:45.403 --> 02:20:46.905
BEEN SUBJECT TO PREVAILING WAGE,

02:20:46.971 --> 02:20:48.773
OR IS IT GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT

02:20:48.840 --> 02:20:50.909
ON THE PROTECTIONS THAT WE

02:20:50.975 --> 02:20:52.877
EXPECT? THERE'S ALSO A PROVISION

02:20:52.944 --> 02:20:55.647
IN THIS SECTION OF THE BUDGET

02:20:55.713 --> 02:20:57.782
TWO THAT AFFECTS BUILDERS REMEDY

02:20:57.849 --> 02:21:00.051
PROJECTS IN MY DISTRICT THAT ARE

02:21:00.118 --> 02:21:03.188
REALLY, I THINK, DRAMATICALLY

02:21:03.254 --> 02:21:05.356
WRONG. THEY ARE NOT DESIGNED TO

02:21:05.423 --> 02:21:06.658
PROVIDE HOUSING TO FOLKS. THEY

02:21:06.724 --> 02:21:09.194
ARE THEY ARE REALLY ABUSES OF

02:21:09.260 --> 02:21:11.029
THE PROCESS. AND THE ONLY

02:21:11.095 --> 02:21:12.597
PROTECTION THAT THE LOCAL

02:21:12.664 --> 02:21:13.431
GOVERNMENTS IN MY DISTRICT HAVE

02:21:13.498 --> 02:21:15.466
IS THE SECRET PROCESS THAT LOOKS

02:21:15.533 --> 02:21:17.268
LIKE IT IS GOING TO BE EXEMPT

02:21:17.335 --> 02:21:18.636
FROM. AND I'M VERY CONCERNED

02:21:18.703 --> 02:21:20.972
ABOUT THAT AS IT PERTAINS

02:21:21.039 --> 02:21:22.740
SPECIFICALLY TO MY DISTRICT. FOR

02:21:22.807 --> 02:21:24.108
THOSE BUILDERS REMEDY PROJECTS

02:21:24.175 --> 02:21:28.279
UNDER FIVE. UNDER FIVE ACRES.

02:21:28.346 --> 02:21:30.548
AND SO I WANT TO HAVE SOME

02:21:30.615 --> 02:21:32.450
GREATER CLARITY ABOUT THAT AS WE

02:21:32.517 --> 02:21:38.523
MOVE FORWARD. THANK. DID YOU

02:21:38.590 --> 02:21:41.693
WANT RESPONSE? I KNOW THAT'S

02:21:41.759 --> 02:21:42.927
VERY FINE GRAINED QUESTION, BUT

02:21:42.994 --> 02:21:45.496
IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD

02:21:45.563 --> 02:21:51.836
OTHERWISE WE CAN GET IT HERE.

02:21:51.903 --> 02:21:53.171
MEGAN TOKUNAGA BLOCK DEPARTMENT

02:21:53.238 --> 02:21:55.540
OF FINANCE I DON'T HAVE THAT

02:21:55.607 --> 02:21:56.741
DETAIL AT MY FINGERTIPS, BUT WE

02:21:56.808 --> 02:21:59.677
CAN FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR STAFF.

02:21:59.744 --> 02:22:01.279
ALL RIGHT. WE WILL WE WILL

02:22:01.346 --> 02:22:04.382
CIRCLE BACK ON THAT ONE MEMBER.

02:22:04.449 --> 02:22:08.019
PATEL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AS A

02:22:08.086 --> 02:22:09.621

02:23:00.738 --> 02:23:03.474

SPOKEN WITH MANY ACROSS SAN

DIEGO, HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE

02:23:09.280 --> 02:23:10.315
FUNDING THAT THEY THOUGHT WOULD

02:23:10.381 --> 02:23:12.050
BE COMING THEIR WAY. AND IT'S

02:23:12.116 --> 02:23:14.285
CRUCIAL FUNDING AS THE COVID

02:23:14.352 --> 02:23:15.687
INTERVENTION DOLLARS GOT WOUND

02:23:15.753 --> 02:23:17.789

02:23:17.855 --> 02:23:18.990
BUCKETS OF FUNDING. THEY WERE

02:23:19.057 --> 02:23:20.758
REALLY HOPING TO FILL THOSE GAPS

02:23:20.825 --> 02:23:22.527
WITH THE YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

02:23:22.593 --> 02:23:23.394

02:23:34.072 --> 02:23:35.306
THIS IS ONE OF THE MAIN

02:23:35.373 --> 02:23:37.175
QUESTIONS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE

02:23:37.241 --> 02:23:38.576
ASKING IS, WHERE IS THAT MONEY?

02:23:38.643 --> 02:23:40.411
AND HOW CAN WE GET OUR CHILDREN

02:23:40.478 --> 02:23:41.612

02:23:41.679 --> 02:23:42.714
SUPPORTS AND SERVICES THAT THEY

02:23:42.780 --> 02:23:44.716
SO DESPERATELY NEED?

02:23:44.782 --> 02:23:46.651
ADDITIONALLY, I WANT TO

02:23:46.718 --> 02:23:47.885
HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE CONCERNS

02:23:47.952 --> 02:23:50.254
AROUND THE PREVAILING WAGE AND

02:23:50.321 --> 02:23:51.689
MAKING SURE THAT OUR WORKERS ARE

02:23:51.756 --> 02:23:53.458
AT THE TABLE WHEN WE'RE TALKING

02:23:53.524 --> 02:23:54.559
ABOUT MAKING CHANGES TO THE WAY

02:23:54.625 --> 02:23:57.428
THAT OUR WORKERS RECEIVE

02:23:57.495 --> 02:23:58.997
COMPENSATION FOR CONTRIBUTING TO

02:23:59.063 --> 02:24:00.631
OUR STRONG ECONOMIES AND OUR

02:24:00.698 --> 02:24:02.934
STRONG COMMUNITIES ALSO WANT TO

02:24:03.001 --> 02:24:07.238
ECHO CONCERNS AROUND

02:24:07.305 --> 02:24:08.139
AFFORDABILITY. WHEN WE TALK

02:24:08.206 --> 02:24:09.040
ABOUT AFFORDABILITY FROM THE

02:24:09.107 --> 02:24:10.141
DAIS, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

02:24:10.208 --> 02:24:11.142
AFFORDABILITY IN OUR

02:24:11.209 --> 02:24:14.045
COMMUNITIES, IT TIES INTO A HUGE

02:24:14.112 --> 02:24:15.480
WEB OF CONTRIBUTIONS FROM

02:24:15.546 --> 02:24:16.981
DIFFERENT WORKERS OF DIFFERENT

02:24:17.048 --> 02:24:18.249
CLASSES. IT INCLUDES THE

02:24:18.316 --> 02:24:20.051
CHILDCARE SECTOR. IT INCLUDES

02:24:20.118 --> 02:24:22.587
THE IN-HOME HEALTH SERVICES,

02:24:22.653 --> 02:24:25.757
IN-HOME HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS

02:24:25.823 --> 02:24:27.425
AND ALL OF THESE THINGS. WHEN WE

02:24:27.492 --> 02:24:28.726
LOOK AT THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE

02:24:28.793 --> 02:24:30.828
IN THE BUDGET HERE, WE'RE SEEING

02:24:30.895 --> 02:24:32.663
SOME, BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH. IF WE

02:24:32.730 --> 02:24:34.699
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF

02:24:34.766 --> 02:24:36.300
OUR WORKERS CAN REALIZE ALL OF

02:24:36.367 --> 02:24:37.168
THEIR POTENTIAL, WE NEED TO MAKE

02:24:37.235 --> 02:24:38.536
SURE THAT OUR BUDGET REFLECTS

02:24:38.603 --> 02:24:40.238
THAT, AND THEY'RE RECEIVING ALL

02:24:40.304 --> 02:24:41.906
THE SUPPORTS THAT THEY NEED TO

02:24:41.973 --> 02:24:43.808
DO IT EFFECTIVELY. SO I'M HOPING

02:24:43.875 --> 02:24:45.676
TO SEE SOME MOVEMENT IN THAT

02:24:45.743 --> 02:24:47.178
DIRECTION, IF AT ALL POSSIBLE,

02:24:47.245 --> 02:24:48.880
BUT CERTAINLY FOCUS AROUND THE

TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN PARTNER

02:24:54.852 --> 02:24:55.319
AND GET THE SERVICES AND

02:24:55.386 --> 02:24:57.889

02:25:57.048 --> 02:25:58.616
HAVE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS JUST

02:25:58.683 --> 02:26:01.018
ON THE LANGUAGE THAT HAS BEEN

02:26:01.085 --> 02:26:03.154
PUT FORTH. AND SO I JUST WANT TO

02:26:03.221 --> 02:26:04.188
UPLOAD THOSE COMMENTS, BUT

02:26:04.255 --> 02:26:05.656
REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK AND

02:26:05.723 --> 02:26:07.725
EFFORTS OF OUR CHAIR AND TO

02:26:07.792 --> 02:26:08.292
LEADERSHIP AND TO EVERYONE.

02:26:08.359 --> 02:26:11.529
THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU SO

02:26:11.596 --> 02:26:14.198
MUCH, MAYOR CONNOLLY. THANK YOU

02:26:14.265 --> 02:26:16.033
CHAIR. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE.

02:26:16.100 --> 02:26:17.635
APOLOGIES FOR BEING AT A COUPLE

02:26:17.702 --> 02:26:18.569
OTHER HEARINGS, BUT HAVE BEEN

02:26:18.636 --> 02:26:21.539
KIND OF KEEPING TRACK OF THE

02:26:21.606 --> 02:26:23.474
ROBUST DISCUSSION THAT HAS BEEN

02:26:23.541 --> 02:26:25.076
GOING ON AROUND THIS AND JUST

02:26:25.143 --> 02:26:28.579
REALLY WANTED TO ECHO SOME OF

02:26:28.646 --> 02:26:30.081
THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN

02:26:30.148 --> 02:26:34.051
RAISED IN MY CASE, SOME OF THOSE

02:26:34.118 --> 02:26:35.520
CONCERNS STARTED WITH THE

02:26:35.586 --> 02:26:38.623
ORIGINAL BILL, AB 609, ON THE

02:26:38.689 --> 02:26:41.893
MERITS, IN CONVERSATIONS WITH

02:26:41.959 --> 02:26:45.196
THE AUTHOR, WITH INTERESTED

02:26:45.263 --> 02:26:48.432
STAKEHOLDERS. MY HOPE WAS THAT

02:26:48.499 --> 02:26:50.468
THAT WAS GOING TO CONTINUE

02:26:50.535 --> 02:26:52.503
THROUGH THE POLICY PROCESS, THAT

02:26:52.570 --> 02:26:56.307
WE COULD CONTINUE TO TALK

02:26:56.374 --> 02:26:57.842
THROUGH THE ISSUES IN KIND OF A

02:26:57.909 --> 02:27:00.344
MORE ROBUST WAY. BUT WE FIND

02:27:00.411 --> 02:27:03.047
OURSELVES NOW AGAIN LOOKING AT

02:27:03.114 --> 02:27:07.084
THE PROSPECT OF ENACTING OR

02:27:07.151 --> 02:27:08.886
DECIDING ON SERIOUS POLICY

02:27:08.953 --> 02:27:11.422
THROUGH A BUDGET TRAILER

02:27:11.489 --> 02:27:13.758
PROCESS. AND IN THIS CASE, WITH

02:27:13.824 --> 02:27:17.161
JUST HOURS OF REVIEW AND

02:27:17.228 --> 02:27:20.198
QUESTIONING POSSIBLE, I FIND

02:27:20.264 --> 02:27:22.233
THAT INADEQUATE, TO SAY THE

02:27:22.300 --> 02:27:24.735
LEAST. SO I'M GOING TO CONTINUE

02:27:24.802 --> 02:27:27.672
TO BE THINKING THROUGH THOSE

02:27:27.738 --> 02:27:30.274
CONCERNS. THOSE INCLUDE, AS I

02:27:30.341 --> 02:27:32.343
THINK IT WAS, ASSEMBLYMEMBER

02:27:32.410 --> 02:27:35.146
HART MENTIONED, SEQUA AND KIND

02:27:35.213 --> 02:27:38.849
OF THE ABILITY OF LOCAL

02:27:38.916 --> 02:27:40.985
COMMUNITIES TO BE HEARD ON

02:27:41.052 --> 02:27:47.158
RELEVANT ISSUES. I FULLY SUPPORT

02:27:47.225 --> 02:27:48.893
COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE SPOKEN UP,

02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:49.760
AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE HAVE

02:27:49.827 --> 02:27:53.998
BEEN MANY ON THE ISSUE OF WAGES.

02:27:54.065 --> 02:27:56.467
THIS PROPOSAL, I WILL SAY NOW,

02:27:56.534 --> 02:27:58.369
NOT HAVING EVEN HAD A CHANCE TO

02:27:58.436 --> 02:28:00.438
READ IT IN FULL, IS CONFUSING AT

02:28:00.504 --> 02:28:02.506
BEST, AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE

02:28:02.573 --> 02:28:04.709
ARE REAL CONCERNS THAT IT COULD

02:28:04.775 --> 02:28:07.211
RESULT IN SUBSTANDARD WAGES, OR

02:28:07.278 --> 02:28:10.481
CERTAINLY NOT PREVAILING WAGES,

02:28:10.548 --> 02:28:14.185
WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT GOAL THAT

02:28:14.252 --> 02:28:16.754
WE WANT TO ACHIEVE. SO I'M GOING

02:28:16.821 --> 02:28:18.422
TO LEAVE IT AT THAT RIGHT NOW. I

02:28:18.489 --> 02:28:21.692
KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO

02:28:21.759 --> 02:28:24.528
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS,

02:28:24.595 --> 02:28:26.764
BUT JUST WANT TO AT LEAST BE ON

02:28:26.831 --> 02:28:29.267
RECORD AS CONVEYING THOSE

02:28:29.333 --> 02:28:31.035
CONCERNS AT THIS TIME. THANK

02:28:31.102 --> 02:28:33.204
YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY

02:28:33.271 --> 02:28:36.107
OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE?

02:28:36.173 --> 02:28:41.545
OH, YES. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WHAT

02:28:41.612 --> 02:28:44.115
I, WHAT I FOR ME, I WANT TO ECHO

02:28:44.181 --> 02:28:45.416
THE SENTIMENTS OF ALL OF MY

02:28:45.483 --> 02:28:47.184
COLLEAGUES IN REGARDS TO HOW

02:28:47.251 --> 02:28:48.386
WE'RE MOVING FORWARD AND

02:28:48.452 --> 02:28:51.889
PARTICULARLY LOOKING AT AB, SB

02:28:51.956 --> 02:28:53.724
ONE 130. BUT I WANT TO SAY IS

02:28:53.791 --> 02:28:56.294
THAT IF OUR BUDGET IS TRULY A

02:28:56.360 --> 02:28:58.396
REFLECTION OF OUR VALUES, THEN

02:28:58.462 --> 02:29:00.231
OUR PROCESS IN CREATING THE

02:29:00.298 --> 02:29:02.099
BUDGET MUST BE AN ALL INCLUSIVE

02:29:02.166 --> 02:29:03.434
PROCESS. I'VE SAID THAT FROM

02:29:03.501 --> 02:29:04.535
TIME AND TIME AGAIN THAT

02:29:04.602 --> 02:29:06.404
EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE A SEAT AT

02:29:06.470 --> 02:29:08.105
THE TABLE AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE

02:29:08.172 --> 02:29:09.874
FORWARD AND TO HEAR THAT NUMBER

02:29:09.940 --> 02:29:11.709
OF OUR WORKERS VOICES HAVE BEEN

02:29:11.776 --> 02:29:13.577
DELIBERATELY KEPT OUT OF

02:29:13.644 --> 02:29:15.413
CONVERSATIONS AS IT AS IT DEALS

02:29:15.479 --> 02:29:18.582
WITH THEIR PAY, I FIND IT TO BE

02:29:18.649 --> 02:29:19.216
APPALLING AND SOMETHING THAT IS

02:29:19.283 --> 02:29:20.384
NOT ACCEPTABLE. NOW. WE JUST

02:29:20.451 --> 02:29:22.787
RECENTLY RELEASED A REPORT FROM

02:29:22.853 --> 02:29:24.855
THE POLICY AND RESEARCH DIVISION

02:29:24.922 --> 02:29:26.357
AND TALK ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY.

02:29:26.424 --> 02:29:27.458
WE'LL TALK ABOUT AFFORDABILITY

02:29:27.525 --> 02:29:29.193
WITHIN ITSELF AND THE RISING

02:29:29.260 --> 02:29:31.295
COST OF LIVING WITHIN THE STATE

02:29:31.362 --> 02:29:32.196
OF CALIFORNIA. THAT REPORT

02:29:32.263 --> 02:29:34.031
CLEARLY, CLEARLY HIGHLIGHTS 20

02:29:34.098 --> 02:29:36.233
COUNTIES, ALONG WITH ANOTHER 14

02:29:36.300 --> 02:29:37.635
COUNTIES, BASED ON THE MINIMUM

02:29:37.702 --> 02:29:40.171
WAGE ITSELF AND THE AMOUNT THAT

02:29:40.237 --> 02:29:41.806
IT TAKES FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE. I

02:29:41.872 --> 02:29:43.541
WANT US TO GO BACK TO LOOK AT

02:29:43.607 --> 02:29:45.076
THOSE, YOU KNOW, THAT ACTUAL

02:29:45.142 --> 02:29:46.877
REPORT THAT WAS GIVEN TO ALL OF

02:29:46.944 --> 02:29:48.112
MY COLLEAGUES. AND THEN AS WE

02:29:48.179 --> 02:29:50.281
CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD TO HAVE

02:29:50.348 --> 02:29:50.915
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE BUDGET

02:29:50.981 --> 02:29:52.416
AND PREVAILING WAGES AND MINIMUM

02:29:52.483 --> 02:29:54.251
WAGE, NO ONE UNDERSTAND THAT THE

02:29:54.318 --> 02:29:55.252
REPORTS, IT ACTUALLY SAYS THAT

02:29:55.319 --> 02:29:57.388
OUR CURRENT WAGES IS NOT ENOUGH

02:29:57.455 --> 02:29:59.256
AT ALL FOR PEOPLE TO SURVIVE

02:29:59.323 --> 02:30:00.324
HERE WITHIN THE STATE OF

02:30:00.391 --> 02:30:01.726
CALIFORNIA. SO WHEN WE HAVE

02:30:01.792 --> 02:30:03.561
THESE DIALOGS, KEEP PEOPLE IN

02:30:03.627 --> 02:30:05.062
MIND. BE SURE TO HUMANIZE THE

02:30:05.129 --> 02:30:06.530
CURRENT SITUATION AND MAKE SURE

02:30:06.597 --> 02:30:07.832
THAT WE ARE KEEPING PEOPLE AT

02:30:07.898 --> 02:30:11.068
THE FOREFRONT AND STICK TO

02:30:11.135 --> 02:30:12.503
EXACTLY WHAT ALL WE ARE TALKING

02:30:12.570 --> 02:30:14.572
ABOUT. MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN

02:30:14.638 --> 02:30:15.339
MAKE CALIFORNIA AFFORDABLE AND

02:30:15.406 --> 02:30:17.575
KEEPING PEOPLE ABLE TO KEEP FOOD

02:30:17.641 --> 02:30:18.609
ON THEIR TABLE, BE ABLE TO

02:30:18.676 --> 02:30:20.277
AFFORD CHILDCARE, BE ABLE TO

02:30:20.344 --> 02:30:23.013
AFFORD THE GAS PRICES AND ETC. I

02:30:23.080 --> 02:30:25.149
AM A PROUD UNION MEMBER AS WELL,

02:30:25.216 --> 02:30:27.318
AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL

02:30:27.385 --> 02:30:29.019
OF US, ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES AND

02:30:29.086 --> 02:30:30.488
EVERYONE ELSE DEFINITELY HAVE A

02:30:30.554 --> 02:30:33.524
SEAT AT THE TABLE AT ALL TIMES.

02:30:33.591 --> 02:30:34.925
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ASSEMBLY

02:30:34.992 --> 02:30:37.128
MEMBER. ANY. ALL RIGHT, MR.

02:30:37.194 --> 02:30:38.763
SCHULTZ, THANK YOU VERY MUCH,

02:30:38.829 --> 02:30:41.031
MR. CHAIR. JUST WANTED TO ECHO

02:30:41.098 --> 02:30:42.433
THE COMMENTS OF MY OF MY

02:30:42.500 --> 02:30:44.268
COLLEAGUES BEFORE I DO, I JUST

02:30:44.335 --> 02:30:45.736
WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR

02:30:45.803 --> 02:30:47.638
STAFF. I KNOW IT'S BEEN QUITE A

02:30:47.705 --> 02:30:49.306
LIFT TO GET TO THIS POINT. I

02:30:49.373 --> 02:30:51.275
ALSO WANT TO THANK MY BUDGET SUB

02:30:51.342 --> 02:30:52.209
CHAIR, ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS. I

02:30:52.276 --> 02:30:54.378
WILL JUST SAY ON THAT NOTE, IN

02:30:54.445 --> 02:30:55.780
TERMS OF SUB SIX, I KNOW THAT

02:30:55.846 --> 02:30:57.515
THAT WHILE IT'S A RELATIVELY

02:30:57.581 --> 02:30:58.949
SMALLER PORTION OF THE BUDGET, A

02:30:59.016 --> 02:31:01.152
SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR IN BALANCING

02:31:01.218 --> 02:31:02.653
OR ATTEMPTING TO BALANCE THE

02:31:02.720 --> 02:31:04.355
BUDGET IS THE COST SAVINGS THAT

02:31:04.422 --> 02:31:06.490
CDCR IS SEEKING TO IMPLEMENT.

02:31:06.557 --> 02:31:08.325
AND I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY

02:31:08.392 --> 02:31:09.827
THAT THEY DID NOT ACHIEVE THE

02:31:09.894 --> 02:31:12.396
COST SAVINGS IN THE LAST BUDGET

02:31:12.463 --> 02:31:13.197
THAT THEY SET OUT TO DO. SO I

02:31:13.264 --> 02:31:15.199
JUST WANT TO PUT CDCR ON ON

02:31:15.266 --> 02:31:16.467
NOTICE THAT NEXT YEAR, AS WE

02:31:16.534 --> 02:31:18.068
APPROACH THAT BUDGET, I WILL BE

02:31:18.135 --> 02:31:19.403
LOOKING TO SEE IF THEY ARE

02:31:19.470 --> 02:31:20.404
ACTUALLY FOLLOWING THROUGH ON

02:31:20.471 --> 02:31:21.839
THE COST SAVINGS THAT THEY

02:31:21.906 --> 02:31:22.440
PROMISE, BECAUSE THEIR ABILITY

02:31:22.506 --> 02:31:24.475
TO DO THAT, OR THEIR FAILURE TO

02:31:24.542 --> 02:31:27.111
DO THAT, IS GOING TO DRIVE WHAT

02:31:27.178 --> 02:31:27.745
NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET LOOKS LIKE.

02:31:27.812 --> 02:31:29.914
SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WHEN

02:31:29.980 --> 02:31:30.481
WE SET TARGETS FOR REDUCING

02:31:30.548 --> 02:31:32.082
COST, REDUCING EXPENSE OR SAVING

02:31:32.149 --> 02:31:32.650
COSTS, THAT WE ARE MAKING

02:31:32.716 --> 02:31:33.951
MEANINGFUL STRIDES TO ACHIEVE

02:31:34.018 --> 02:31:36.020
THAT. WITH REGARDS TO WHAT SO

02:31:36.086 --> 02:31:37.621
MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID

02:31:37.688 --> 02:31:40.024
SO ELOQUENTLY, I HAVE A CONCERN

02:31:40.090 --> 02:31:42.693
ABOUT ABOUT PROCESS. I WILL

02:31:42.760 --> 02:31:44.462
CONTINUE TO BE LOOKING CLOSELY

02:31:44.528 --> 02:31:47.731
AT BILL NUMBER 130, SB 130. I

02:31:47.798 --> 02:31:49.099
JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT MY

02:31:49.166 --> 02:31:50.267
CONCERN FROM PROCESS COMES FROM

02:31:50.334 --> 02:31:52.269
THE FACT THAT SB 130 INCLUDES

02:31:52.336 --> 02:31:54.171
PROVISIONS OF MY BILL, AB 306,

02:31:54.238 --> 02:31:56.273
AND YET I FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS

02:31:56.340 --> 02:31:58.008
INCLUDED IN SB 130 WHEN

02:31:58.075 --> 02:31:59.176
ENVIRONMENTAL VOTERS CALLED ME

02:31:59.243 --> 02:32:01.178
TO SAY, HEY, YOUR BILLS IN SB

02:32:01.245 --> 02:32:03.113
130. AND I THINK THE POINT I'M

02:32:03.180 --> 02:32:04.615
TRYING TO MAKE IS THAT CLEARLY

02:32:04.682 --> 02:32:06.050
THERE NEEDS TO BE BETTER

02:32:06.116 --> 02:32:06.984
COMMUNICATION IN THE DAYS AHEAD.

02:32:07.051 --> 02:32:08.853
WE HAVE LESS THAN 48 HOURS

02:32:08.919 --> 02:32:10.354
BEFORE A FLOOR VOTE, AND I

02:32:10.421 --> 02:32:11.388
STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THE

02:32:11.455 --> 02:32:12.056
ADMINISTRATION TO BE WORKING

02:32:12.122 --> 02:32:13.924
WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS. I THINK

02:32:13.991 --> 02:32:15.359
THAT WHAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM

02:32:15.426 --> 02:32:17.161
THE DÍAS UP HERE IS A LOT OF

02:32:17.228 --> 02:32:18.496
QUESTIONS AND A LOT OF CONCERNS,

02:32:18.562 --> 02:32:20.598
AND I THINK THE PROCESS COULD

02:32:20.664 --> 02:32:21.765
HAVE BEEN IMPROVED. BUT WITH

02:32:21.832 --> 02:32:23.567
THAT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

02:32:23.634 --> 02:32:24.869
YOUR LEADERSHIP, MR. CHAIR.

02:32:24.935 --> 02:32:25.736
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANYBODY

02:32:25.803 --> 02:32:27.137
ELSE? ONCE, TWICE. ALL RIGHT.

02:32:27.204 --> 02:32:29.673
WITH THAT, I WILL THANK ALL OF

02:32:29.740 --> 02:32:31.041
MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR

02:32:31.108 --> 02:32:32.977
THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS, QUESTIONS

02:32:33.043 --> 02:32:34.845
FOR ALL OF THE HARD WORK. I KNOW

02:32:34.912 --> 02:32:36.380
THAT IT HAS BEEN QUITE A

02:32:36.447 --> 02:32:38.649
JOURNEY, AND I JUST AGAIN, WANT

02:32:38.716 --> 02:32:39.783
TO APPRECIATE EVERYBODY WHO HAS

02:32:39.850 --> 02:32:41.385
SAT THROUGH THE MANY BUDGET

02:32:41.452 --> 02:32:42.586
SUBCOMMITTEE HEARINGS, THE MANY

02:32:42.653 --> 02:32:45.122
HOURS OF PUBLIC COMMENT AND ALL

02:32:45.189 --> 02:32:47.358
THE HARD WORK TO BRING US TO

02:32:47.424 --> 02:32:49.093
THIS POINT. SO WITH THAT, WE ARE

02:32:49.159 --> 02:32:50.327
GOING TO GO NOW TO THE PUBLIC

ENVIRONMENTAL VOTERS I'M GOING

02:33:06.710 --> 02:33:08.279
TO TALK QUICKLY BECAUSE A LOT TO

02:33:08.345 --> 02:33:09.179
SAY, WE ARE, OF COURSE,

02:33:09.246 --> 02:33:10.781
CONCERNED ABOUT THE USE OF $1

02:33:10.848 --> 02:33:11.682
BILLION FROM GRF TO GENERAL

02:33:11.749 --> 02:33:13.617
FUND, AND THE OUTYEAR SHIFTS TO

02:33:13.684 --> 02:33:15.719
FROM GRF TO GENERAL FUND. I WANT

02:33:15.786 --> 02:33:17.154
TO POINT OUT THE CONNECTION

02:33:17.221 --> 02:33:18.355
BETWEEN THE CLAWING BACK OF

02:33:18.422 --> 02:33:20.157
FEDERAL FUNDING FOR HEALTH CARE

02:33:20.224 --> 02:33:20.991
AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

02:33:21.058 --> 02:33:22.259
FUNDING, EVEN AT THE STATE

02:33:22.326 --> 02:33:23.661

FUNDING FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND

02:33:26.630 --> 02:33:28.232
HEALTH PROTECTIONS, THOSE THINGS

02:33:28.299 --> 02:33:29.700
ARE CONNECTED VERY MUCH TO HUMAN

02:33:29.767 --> 02:33:31.835
HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE. SO

02:33:31.902 --> 02:33:32.369
REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE

02:33:32.436 --> 02:33:33.837
CONTINUE TO FUND THOSE THINGS.

02:33:33.904 --> 02:33:35.205
THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY HAS

02:33:35.272 --> 02:33:37.942
PROPOSED SOLUTIONS FOR THOSE

02:33:38.008 --> 02:33:39.843
SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT SB

02:33:39.910 --> 02:33:41.712
607 BEING PART OF THE BUDGET,

02:33:41.779 --> 02:33:44.114
AND THAT AB 3131 HAS NOT GONE

02:33:44.181 --> 02:33:46.317
INTO PRINT YET. WE WERE WORKING

02:33:46.383 --> 02:33:48.586
WITH THE AUTHOR ON AMENDMENTS.

02:33:48.652 --> 02:33:50.454
WE HAD A AMENDED POSITION ON

02:33:50.521 --> 02:33:53.223
THAT, AND WE ARE JUST, YOU KNOW,

02:33:53.290 --> 02:33:54.325
WAITING FOR THAT LANGUAGE TO GO

02:33:54.391 --> 02:33:56.393
INTO PRINT. AND WE'LL BE GETTING

02:33:56.460 --> 02:33:57.761
BACK TO YOU ON OUR POSITION IF

02:33:57.828 --> 02:33:58.429
THAT WARRANTS AN OPPOSED

02:33:58.495 --> 02:34:00.631
POSITION. ALTHOUGH THIS IS THE

02:34:00.698 --> 02:34:02.132
LAST PART, PART, WE CAN COMMENT.

02:34:02.199 --> 02:34:03.400
SO WE'LL SAY THAT. ONE LAST

02:34:03.467 --> 02:34:04.602
THING I WANT TO APPRECIATE

02:34:04.668 --> 02:34:05.402
ASSEMBLY MEMBER SCHULTZ FOR WHAT

02:34:05.469 --> 02:34:07.404
HE SAID. AND WE ARE CONCERNED

02:34:07.471 --> 02:34:09.039
ABOUT AB 306 GOING INTO THE

02:34:09.106 --> 02:34:10.474
BUDGET PROCESS. WE DO OPPOSE THE

02:34:10.541 --> 02:34:11.442
INCLUSION OF THAT IN THE BUDGET.

02:34:11.508 --> 02:34:14.411
AND AB 130 AND WE WERE IN ACTIVE

02:34:14.478 --> 02:34:15.112
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT VERY

02:34:15.179 --> 02:34:17.848
REASONABLE CHANGES TO THAT. AND

02:34:17.915 --> 02:34:20.517
SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH,

02:34:20.584 --> 02:34:21.518

AND THE ELEVATOR CONSTRUCTORS

02:34:36.400 --> 02:34:39.837
UNION. IN MY 37 YEARS, I HAVE

02:34:39.903 --> 02:34:41.672
NEVER SEEN A MINIMUM WAGE

02:34:41.739 --> 02:34:43.507
ADOPTED FOR THE PURPOSES OF

02:34:43.574 --> 02:34:45.676
SUPPRESSING WAGES, NOT LIFTING

02:34:45.743 --> 02:34:48.946
WORKERS UP. WE HAVE NEVER HAD A

02:34:49.013 --> 02:34:51.782

02:34:51.849 --> 02:34:54.251

WITHOUT HAVING A SAY OR

02:34:59.123 --> 02:35:01.792
REPRESENTATION. THIS IS THE MOST

02:35:01.859 --> 02:35:03.661
OUTRAGEOUS ABUSE OF PROCESS THAT

02:35:03.727 --> 02:35:05.929
I'VE EVER WITNESSED. MAKE NO

02:35:05.996 --> 02:35:07.264
MISTAKE, THIS BILL WAS AMENDED

02:35:07.331 --> 02:35:09.433
THIS LATE AND CONNECTED TO THE

02:35:09.500 --> 02:35:11.969
BUDGET WITH A POISON PILL TO

02:35:12.036 --> 02:35:13.704
FORCE EVERY MEMBER OF THIS

02:35:13.771 --> 02:35:15.639
LEGISLATURE TO VOTE FOR THINGS

02:35:15.706 --> 02:35:16.206
THAT THEIR CONSCIENCE WOULD

02:35:16.273 --> 02:35:17.775
NEVER ALLOW THEM TO DO.

02:35:17.841 --> 02:35:20.044
OTHERWISE. IT'S SHAMEFUL, AND IT

02:35:20.110 --> 02:35:22.680
WILL LEAVE A BLACK MARK ON THIS

02:35:22.746 --> 02:35:23.847
LEGISLATURE AND ANYBODY WHO

02:35:23.914 --> 02:35:26.450

02:35:26.517 --> 02:35:33.691

FOR TODAY, WHICH BASICALLY

02:35:46.603 --> 02:35:47.938
IMPREGNATES ALL OF YOU WITHOUT

02:35:48.005 --> 02:35:51.308

OR YOU'LL LOSE COMMITTEE

02:36:03.087 --> 02:36:05.289
ASSIGNMENTS OR WHATEVER. SO WE

02:36:05.355 --> 02:36:08.459
OPPOSE AB 102 AND THAT OR THAT

02:36:08.525 --> 02:36:11.028
PROVISION OF AB 102. AND WE

02:36:11.095 --> 02:36:14.231
OPPOSE AB 130. WE WILL OPPOSE AB

02:36:14.298 --> 02:36:17.534

02:36:17.601 --> 02:36:20.871

LINDA HèA WITH WESTERN CENTER ON

02:36:22.606 --> 02:36:24.475
LAW AND POVERTY. WE APPRECIATE

02:36:24.541 --> 02:36:26.543
SOME PIECES OF THE BUDGET,

02:36:26.610 --> 02:36:28.145
SPECIFICALLY THE REJECTION OF

02:36:28.212 --> 02:36:29.813
CUTS TO OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE

02:36:29.880 --> 02:36:31.849
WITH DISABILITIES THROUGH

02:36:31.915 --> 02:36:33.117
REINSTATEMENT OF THE ASSET LIMIT

02:36:33.183 --> 02:36:35.052
AT A MORE REASONABLE AMOUNT,

02:36:35.119 --> 02:36:36.987
REJECTION OF THE CUTS TO IHSS

02:36:37.054 --> 02:36:40.524
AND LONG TERM CARE, AS WELL AS

02:36:40.591 --> 02:36:42.426
EFFORTS TO REIMAGINE CALWORKS TO

02:36:42.493 --> 02:36:44.461
MAKE MORE FAMILY CENTERED.

02:36:44.528 --> 02:36:46.263
HOWEVER, OVERALL, THE BUDGET

02:36:46.330 --> 02:36:49.500
STILL BALANCES ON THE BACKS OF

02:36:49.566 --> 02:36:52.002
LOW INCOME IMMIGRANT FAMILIES.

02:36:52.069 --> 02:36:53.871
IN PARTICULAR, THE BUDGET CUTS

02:36:53.937 --> 02:36:55.906
MAKES DISCRIMINATORY MEDI-CAL

02:36:55.973 --> 02:36:57.741
CUTS TO IMMIGRANT FAMILIES,

02:36:57.808 --> 02:36:59.510
CREATING A TWO TIER MEDI-CAL

02:36:59.576 --> 02:37:02.513
SYSTEM, WHICH WILL RESULT IN

02:37:02.579 --> 02:37:04.314
PEOPLE LOSING HEALTH COVERAGE

02:37:04.381 --> 02:37:07.151

02:47:02.412 --> 02:47:03.046
CALIFORNIANS ARE FACING AN

02:47:03.113 --> 02:47:04.080
ONSLAUGHT OF FEDERAL POLICY

02:47:04.147 --> 02:47:05.749
SPECIFICALLY TARGETED AT THE

DISENFRANCHISEMENT OF PEOPLE OF

02:47:11.354 --> 02:47:11.888
URGENTLY NEED OUR STATE LEVEL

02:47:11.955 --> 02:47:13.056
REPRESENTATIVES TO STAND UP FOR

02:47:13.123 --> 02:47:13.790
DEMOCRACY. WE ARE INCREDIBLY

02:47:13.857 --> 02:47:15.091
CONCERNED ABOUT ANTICIPATED

02:47:15.158 --> 02:47:15.959
BUDGET TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE

02:47:16.025 --> 02:47:17.694
THAT WOULD FUNDAMENTALLY DESTROY

02:47:17.761 --> 02:47:18.895
THE PROTECTIONS OF THE

02:47:18.962 --> 02:47:19.729
CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY

02:47:19.796 --> 02:47:21.798

SINGLE PUBLIC HEARING ON THE

02:47:22.565 --> 02:47:24.401

02:47:24.467 --> 02:47:25.802
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PUBLIC TO

WEIGH IN BEYOND HOUSING,

02:47:27.103 --> 02:47:28.505
ANTICIPATED BUT STILL UNKNOWN

02:47:28.571 --> 02:47:30.006
PROPOSALS WOULD HAVE GRAVE

02:47:30.073 --> 02:47:31.508
CONSEQUENCES FOR A WIDE SWATH OF

02:47:31.574 --> 02:47:32.575
PROJECT TYPES THAT WOULD GO

02:47:32.642 --> 02:47:34.377
WITHOUT NEEDED REVIEW, EVEN WITH

02:47:34.444 --> 02:47:35.078
ESTABLISHED POTENTIAL HARMS.

02:47:35.145 --> 02:47:36.112
THIS IS DEVASTATING FOR THE

02:47:36.179 --> 02:47:37.614
ENVIRONMENT, PARTICULARLY FOR

02:47:37.680 --> 02:47:38.681
COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO ARE HAVING

02:47:38.748 --> 02:47:40.483
THEIR SOLE OPPORTUNITY FOR

02:47:42.018 --> 02:47:42.986
LOCAL DEMOCRATIC DECISION

02:47:43.052 --> 02:47:44.721

02:47:44.788 --> 02:47:46.589
A NONTRANSPARENT STATE LEVEL

02:47:49.025 --> 02:47:50.260
REASONS WE OPPOSE EFFORTS TO

SIMILAR COMMENTS TO MY COLLEAGUE

02:48:03.306 --> 02:48:04.340
BEFORE ME. WE STRONGLY OPPOSE

02:48:04.407 --> 02:48:06.042
EFFORTS TO ROLL BACK SEQUA IN

02:48:06.109 --> 02:48:07.944

EXPRESSING CONCERN WITH THIS

02:48:12.215 --> 02:48:13.650
PROCESS EQUALLY, IF NOT MORE,

02:48:13.716 --> 02:48:14.751
CONCERNING, IS THE PROCESS

02:48:14.818 --> 02:48:16.853
AROUND SB, AB 131, WHICH STILL

02:48:16.920 --> 02:48:18.855
ISN'T IN PRINT AND WE ANTICIPATE

02:48:18.922 --> 02:48:20.056
WILL INCLUDE ADDITIONAL MAJOR

02:48:20.123 --> 02:48:21.891
ROLLBACKS TO SEQUA AND WILL NOT

02:48:21.958 --> 02:48:23.226
HAVE NONE OF THE KEY

02:48:23.293 --> 02:48:24.360
STAKEHOLDERS HAVE BEEN INVOLVED

02:48:24.427 --> 02:48:26.196
IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS AS WELL.

02:48:26.262 --> 02:48:28.198
AND THIS IS THE LAST HEARING

02:48:28.264 --> 02:48:29.866
WHERE WE WOULD EVEN HAVE A

02:48:29.933 --> 02:48:30.533
CHANCE TO DISCUSS WHAT WOULD BE

02:48:30.600 --> 02:48:32.635
INCLUDED IN THEIR SXL IS ALL

02:48:32.702 --> 02:48:33.236
ABOUT PUBLIC PROCESS. THIS

02:48:33.303 --> 02:48:33.870

JUSTICE COMMUNITIES A VOICE.

02:48:35.738 --> 02:48:37.607
THIS IS HOW WE BUILD TRUST IN

02:48:37.674 --> 02:48:38.475
PROJECTS. THIS TYPE OF BACKDOOR

02:48:38.541 --> 02:48:40.610
DEAL IS EXACTLY AN EXAMPLE OF

02:48:40.677 --> 02:48:42.779
WHY WHAT THE MISTRUST THAT CAN

02:48:42.846 --> 02:48:44.147
COME IF WE DON'T HAVE

02:48:44.214 --> 02:48:45.315
STAKEHOLDERS AT THE TABLE. WE

02:48:45.381 --> 02:48:47.584
DON'T HAVE A PUBLIC PROCESS

02:48:47.650 --> 02:48:48.284
AROUND BIG, BIG CHANGES. FOR

02:48:48.351 --> 02:48:50.720
THESE REASONS, WE OPPOSE EFFORTS

02:48:50.787 --> 02:48:52.922
TO ROLL BACK SEQUA IN THE STATE

02:48:52.989 --> 02:48:55.658

ON BEHALF OF LEADERSHIP COUNCIL

02:48:57.126 --> 02:48:58.528
FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY.

02:48:58.595 --> 02:49:00.797
WE VEHEMENTLY OPPOSE EFFORTS TO

02:49:00.864 --> 02:49:02.398
ROLL BACK BEDROCK ENVIRONMENTAL

02:49:02.465 --> 02:49:05.068
LAW IN CALIFORNIA. SEQUA BEHIND

02:49:05.134 --> 02:49:06.369
CLOSED DOORS AT THE LAST MINUTE

02:49:06.436 --> 02:49:08.338
THROUGH THE STATE BUDGET

02:49:08.404 --> 02:49:09.272
PROCESS, MAKING FUNDING OF

02:49:09.339 --> 02:49:11.207
CRITICAL STATE RESOURCES LIKE

02:49:11.274 --> 02:49:12.242
HEALTHCARE AND AFFORDABLE

02:49:12.308 --> 02:49:14.043
HOUSING DEPENDENT ON GUTTING

02:49:14.110 --> 02:49:15.478
SEQUA HARMS LOW INCOME

02:49:15.545 --> 02:49:16.713
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THAT NEED

02:49:16.779 --> 02:49:18.381
THAT FUNDING THE MOST, AND THAT

02:49:18.448 --> 02:49:20.617
NEED SEQUA TO HAVE ANY SEAT AT

02:49:20.683 --> 02:49:21.551
THE TABLE ON THE POLLUTING OR

02:49:21.618 --> 02:49:23.119
RISKY DEVELOPMENTS THAT

02:49:23.186 --> 02:49:24.420
DISPROPORTIONATELY FALL IN THEIR

02:49:24.487 --> 02:49:25.922
NEIGHBORHOODS. A ROLLBACK OF SXL

02:49:25.989 --> 02:49:28.124
WILL COME AT GREAT COST OF

02:49:28.191 --> 02:49:29.158
CALIFORNIA'S RIGHT TO KNOW ABOUT

02:49:29.225 --> 02:49:30.960
THE IMPACTS OF DEVELOPMENT THAT

02:49:31.027 --> 02:49:32.362
WILL HAVE ON THEIR HEALTH, A

02:49:32.428 --> 02:49:33.796
COST THAT WE WILL BEAR

02:49:33.863 --> 02:49:34.931
IMMEDIATELY AND OVER THE LONG

02:49:34.998 --> 02:49:36.032
TERM, WITH RESULTING

02:49:36.099 --> 02:49:37.433
ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION THAT

02:49:37.500 --> 02:49:39.502
WILL BE EXTREMELY COSTLY, IF NOT

02:49:39.569 --> 02:49:41.371
IMPOSSIBLE, TO UNDO. FURTHER,

02:49:41.437 --> 02:49:42.872
CEQA DOES NOT HOLD BACK

02:49:42.939 --> 02:49:43.840
DEVELOPMENT, THE LARGEST BATTERY

02:49:43.907 --> 02:49:45.542
STORAGE FACILITY IN THE COUNTRY

02:49:45.608 --> 02:49:46.910
AND THE LARGEST SOLAR FARM IN

02:49:46.976 --> 02:49:48.678
STATE HISTORY, WENT THROUGH FULL

02:49:48.745 --> 02:49:50.079
ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW IN JUST

02:49:50.146 --> 02:49:51.180
EIGHT MONTHS. HOWEVER, THAT

02:49:51.247 --> 02:49:52.982
REVIEW WAS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT

02:49:53.049 --> 02:49:54.017
FOR SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES TO

02:49:54.083 --> 02:49:55.485
ENSURE THE PROJECT IS BUILT

02:49:55.552 --> 02:49:56.886
SAFELY. FOR THESE REASONS, WE

02:49:56.953 --> 02:49:59.322
OPPOSE EFFORTS TO ROLL BACK CEQA

02:49:59.389 --> 02:50:02.992
IN THE STATE BUDGET. THANK YOU.

02:50:03.059 --> 02:50:04.727
GOOD MORNING. CHAIR MEMBERS

GABRIELLA FAZIO WITH SIERRA CLUB

02:50:06.596 --> 02:50:08.197
CALIFORNIA. I'M HERE TO STRONGLY

02:50:08.264 --> 02:50:09.265
OPPOSE EFFORTS TO ROLL BACK CEQA

02:50:09.332 --> 02:50:10.633
AND FREEZE BUILDING CODE

02:50:10.700 --> 02:50:11.634
STATEWIDE IN THE STATE BUDGET

02:50:11.701 --> 02:50:13.369
AND THE INCLUSION OF THIS

02:50:13.436 --> 02:50:14.571
LANGUAGE IN ACCOMPANYING BUDGET

02:50:14.637 --> 02:50:16.406
TRAILER BILLS. CEQA IS NOT THE

02:50:16.472 --> 02:50:18.207
REASON FOR THE DELAYS IN

02:50:18.274 --> 02:50:18.841
DEVELOPMENT, AND BUILDING CODES

02:50:18.908 --> 02:50:20.209
ARE NOT THE REASON FOR RISING

02:50:20.276 --> 02:50:21.711
HOUSING COSTS. GUTTING CEQA AND

02:50:21.778 --> 02:50:23.479
THE PLACING OF A MORATORIUM ON

02:50:23.546 --> 02:50:24.213
BUILDING CODES WILL MAKE

02:50:24.280 --> 02:50:25.748
REACHING AFFORDABILITY IN THE

02:50:25.815 --> 02:50:27.817
LONG TERM EXTREMELY DIFFICULT,

02:50:27.884 --> 02:50:28.885
AND STRIP COMMUNITIES FROM

02:50:28.952 --> 02:50:30.420
HAVING THEIR VOICES AND CONCERNS

02:50:30.486 --> 02:50:32.155
HEARD IN PROJECTS THAT

02:50:32.221 --> 02:50:33.289
DISPROPORTIONATELY LAND IN THEIR

02:50:33.356 --> 02:50:35.391
NEIGHBORHOODS. IT IS EXTREMELY

02:50:35.458 --> 02:50:36.859
DISAPPOINTING AND UNACCEPTABLE

02:50:36.926 --> 02:50:37.927
THAT THESE MAJOR STATEWIDE

02:50:37.994 --> 02:50:39.295
POLICY DECISIONS ARE BEING

02:50:39.362 --> 02:50:40.930
PUSHED THROUGH THE BACK DOOR OF

02:50:40.997 --> 02:50:42.198
THE BUDGET PROCESS WITH NO

02:50:42.265 --> 02:50:44.033
POLICY HEARING, NO STAKEHOLDER

02:50:44.100 --> 02:50:46.102
INPUT AND NO PUBLIC DEBATE.

02:50:46.169 --> 02:50:47.570
CALIFORNIANS DESERVE

02:50:47.637 --> 02:50:49.138
TRANSPARENCY. AT THE VERY LEAST,

02:50:49.205 --> 02:50:50.907
THIS LANGUAGE MUST BE PULLED

02:50:50.974 --> 02:50:51.774
FROM THE BUDGET AND RETURN TO

02:50:51.841 --> 02:50:53.042
THE REGULAR POLICY PROCESS,

02:50:53.109 --> 02:50:55.612
WHERE IT CAN BE DEBATED IN THE

02:50:55.678 --> 02:50:56.980
LIGHT OF DAY. DO NOT. DON'T LET

02:50:57.046 --> 02:50:58.114
THIS SET A PRECEDENT FOR

02:50:58.181 --> 02:51:00.583
OVERRIDING PUBLIC INPUT ON MAJOR

02:51:00.650 --> 02:51:02.652
CLIMATE AND HOUSING POLICY. FOR

02:51:02.719 --> 02:51:03.586
THESE REASONS, WE STRONGLY

02:51:03.653 --> 02:51:04.587
OPPOSE A ROLLBACK OF CEQA AND

02:51:04.654 --> 02:51:07.090
THE FREEZE ON STATEWIDE BUILDING

02:51:07.156 --> 02:51:08.491

02:51:17.834 --> 02:51:18.968
THE LEGISLATURE FOR RECOGNIZING

02:51:19.035 --> 02:51:22.505
THE NEED TO FUND PROPOSITION 36.

02:51:22.572 --> 02:51:24.841
WE ARE, HOWEVER, DISAPPOINTED

02:51:24.907 --> 02:51:27.243
THAT IN THE FINAL PACKAGE, NO

02:51:27.310 --> 02:51:29.145
FUNDING WAS PROVIDED FOR

02:51:29.212 --> 02:51:30.813
SUPERVISION, WHICH IS A KEY

02:51:30.880 --> 02:51:32.615
COMPONENT TO ENSURING PEOPLE

02:51:32.682 --> 02:51:34.484
COMPLETE COURT MANDATED

02:51:34.550 --> 02:51:36.419
TREATMENT. WE HAVE DEEP CONCERNS

02:51:36.486 --> 02:51:38.855
ABOUT THE LOCAL MATCH

02:51:38.921 --> 02:51:39.522
REQUIREMENT, GIVEN THE

02:51:39.589 --> 02:51:41.290
SIGNIFICANT FUNDING CUTS THAT

02:51:41.357 --> 02:51:43.459
COUNTIES FACE FROM THE FEDERAL

02:51:43.526 --> 02:51:45.962
GOVERNMENT, AND WE LOOK FORWARD

02:51:46.029 --> 02:51:47.864
TO FURTHER DISCUSSING ALL OF

02:51:47.930 --> 02:51:55.605
THIS IN THE FALL. HI, MY NAME IS

02:51:55.672 --> 02:51:57.407
JOHN MCCUE. I'M A MECHANICAL

02:51:57.473 --> 02:51:59.742
ENGINEER. I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN

02:51:59.809 --> 02:52:01.511
THE LAST 30 YEARS OF DEVELOPING

02:52:01.577 --> 02:52:06.582
ENERGY CODES IN AMERICA, CANADA,

02:52:06.649 --> 02:52:09.819
AS WELL AS IN CALIFORNIA. I'M

02:52:09.886 --> 02:52:12.255
DISAPPOINTED TO SEE THAT AB 130

02:52:12.321 --> 02:52:13.690
APPEARS TO CIRCUMVENT THE DUE

02:52:13.756 --> 02:52:15.024
DILIGENCE AT THE SENATE HOUSING

02:52:15.091 --> 02:52:16.626
COMMITTEE AND SENATE LOCAL

02:52:16.693 --> 02:52:17.493
GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE SHOULD BE

02:52:17.560 --> 02:52:20.463
PROVIDING ON AB 306 IN THE STATE

02:52:20.530 --> 02:52:21.964
BUILDING STANDARDS. THE TEXT OF

02:52:22.031 --> 02:52:25.568
AB 306 IS BURIED IN SECTIONS 29

02:52:25.635 --> 02:52:29.439
THROUGH 41 OF AB 130. A

02:52:29.505 --> 02:52:30.606
RECOMMENDATION IS TO STRIKE

02:52:30.673 --> 02:52:33.176
THOSE SECTIONS FROM AB 130 AND

02:52:33.242 --> 02:52:34.944
ACTUALLY HAVE A FULL ACCOUNTING

02:52:35.011 --> 02:52:37.080
OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THAT

02:52:37.146 --> 02:52:39.348
STANDARD. THERE IS NO EMERGENCY

02:52:39.415 --> 02:52:41.017
IN TERMS OF THE TIMING, AS THIS

02:52:41.084 --> 02:52:42.885
AFFECTS LOCAL GOVERNMENT CODES

02:52:42.952 --> 02:52:45.188
ADOPTED AFTER OCTOBER 1ST AND

02:52:45.254 --> 02:52:47.223
THE FUTURE. TITLE 24, PART SIX

02:52:47.290 --> 02:52:50.059
ENERGY CODE THAT IS EFFECTIVE

02:52:50.126 --> 02:52:52.562
JANUARY 1ST, 2029. WE WERE

02:52:52.628 --> 02:52:54.464
SUPPOSED TO HAVE A HEARING ON

02:52:54.530 --> 02:52:56.866
THIS NEXT WEEK FOR THE SENATE

02:52:56.933 --> 02:52:58.267
HOUSING COMMITTEE, AND THEN I

02:52:58.334 --> 02:53:00.403
THINK IT WAS A WEEK LATER FOR

02:53:00.470 --> 02:53:03.406
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THE RUSH TO

02:53:03.473 --> 02:53:05.208
JUDGMENT IS NOT IN THE STATE OF

02:53:05.274 --> 02:53:07.009
CALIFORNIA'S BEST INTEREST. LET

02:53:07.076 --> 02:53:08.745
THE SENATE COMMITTEES ADVISE ON

02:53:08.811 --> 02:53:11.214
THE ADVISABILITY OF THESE

02:53:11.280 --> 02:53:15.218
SECTIONS. THIS THIS STANDARD IS

02:53:15.284 --> 02:53:16.385
AND THESE SECTIONS ARE BASED ON

02:53:16.452 --> 02:53:18.054
A MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE COSTS

02:53:18.121 --> 02:53:21.090
AND BENEFIT OF ENERGY CODES. THE

02:53:21.157 --> 02:53:23.092
PROPONENTS FACT SHEET ON AB 306

02:53:23.159 --> 02:53:24.660
CLAIMS THAT STATE POLICIES OVER

02:53:24.727 --> 02:53:28.865
THE PAST 15 YEARS RESULT IN

02:53:28.931 --> 02:53:30.633
50,000 TO $100,000 OF COST.

02:53:30.700 --> 02:53:32.902
HOWEVER, IF YOU LOOK AT THE CBO

02:53:32.969 --> 02:53:34.704
ESTIMATES THAT THIS WAS BASED ON

02:53:34.771 --> 02:53:36.205
ENERGY CODES, WHICH IS THE ONLY

02:53:36.272 --> 02:53:38.174
THING THAT THIS IS AFFECTING,

02:53:38.241 --> 02:53:39.742
HAD A $20,000 COST. AND OVER

02:53:39.809 --> 02:53:41.611
THAT SAME TIME PERIOD, THE COST

02:53:41.677 --> 02:53:45.481
OF HOUSING INCREASED $500,000.

02:53:45.548 --> 02:53:48.017
SO THE IDEA THAT SOMETHING THAT

02:53:48.084 --> 02:53:52.355
HAS A 3% COST IMPACT AFFECTS,

02:53:52.421 --> 02:53:54.090
I'M INFORMED WE HAVE A BUNCH OF

02:53:54.157 --> 02:53:55.458
FOLKS OUTSIDE BEHIND YOU, SO WE

02:53:55.525 --> 02:53:56.959
APPRECIATE IT. I KNOW THAT

02:53:57.026 --> 02:53:58.127
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE

02:53:58.194 --> 02:53:59.328
THAT WANT TO SHARE THEIR

02:53:59.395 --> 02:54:01.397
OPINION. SO JUST JUST WANT TO BE

02:54:01.464 --> 02:54:02.799
FAIR TO EVERYBODY IN TERMS OF

02:54:02.865 --> 02:54:04.700
TIME. YEAH. WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO

02:54:04.767 --> 02:54:06.636
IS THEN I HAVE A DETAILED

02:54:06.702 --> 02:54:07.270
COMMENTS THAT I'D LIKE TO PASS

02:54:07.336 --> 02:54:09.739
ON TO YOUR STAFF, AND I'D LOVE

02:54:12.074 --> 02:54:12.441
INDIVIDUALLY AT YOUR

CLASS WORKERS ALREADY FACE

02:54:33.296 --> 02:54:34.397
CHALLENGING TIMES TO KEEP UP

02:54:34.463 --> 02:54:35.798
WITH AFFORDABILITY. IN

EVERY DAY TO SUPPORT OUR

02:54:38.434 --> 02:54:39.602

02:54:39.669 --> 02:54:42.004
TO BE ABLE TO SEND OUR KIDS TO

02:54:42.071 --> 02:54:42.939
COLLEGE. ALL THIS WHILE

02:54:43.005 --> 02:54:44.740
CHALLENGING ALL THIS WILL BE

02:54:44.807 --> 02:54:46.509
CHALLENGING WHEN WE ARE ALREADY

02:54:46.576 --> 02:54:47.677
FACING OPPOSITION IN INDUSTRIAL

02:54:47.743 --> 02:54:48.945
SECTORS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND

02:54:49.011 --> 02:54:50.513
NOW THERE'S THIS BILL WHICH IS

02:54:50.580 --> 02:54:52.715
LOOKING TO REDUCE OUR WAGES. THE

02:54:52.782 --> 02:54:53.816
AVERAGE BLUE COLLAR WORKER CAN

02:54:53.883 --> 02:54:55.351
AFFORD TO HAVE THEIR JOBS IN

02:54:55.418 --> 02:54:56.752
INDUSTRIAL SECTORS CUT, BUT THEY

02:54:56.819 --> 02:54:58.521
ALSO HAVE THEIR WAGES REDUCED IN

02:54:58.588 --> 02:54:59.922
THE INDUSTRIAL, THE RESIDENTIAL

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY

02:55:05.595 --> 02:55:08.497
PUTS YOU AT ABOUT $74,000 A

02:55:08.564 --> 02:55:09.966
YEAR, WHICH TECHNICALLY IS

02:55:10.032 --> 02:55:11.334
CONSIDERED LOW INCOME FOR A

02:55:44.634 --> 02:55:46.502
NOT, AT THE END OF THE DAY,

02:55:46.569 --> 02:55:48.437
PREVAILING WAGE SETS THE

02:55:48.504 --> 02:55:49.572
STANDARD FOR ALL WORKERS ACROSS

EVERY TIME THAT WE TALK ABOUT

02:55:55.144 --> 02:55:55.678
COMPASSION, WE TALK ABOUT LOW

02:55:55.745 --> 02:55:57.246
INCOME HOUSING. HOW DO WE MAKE

02:55:57.313 --> 02:55:58.347
THE PRECEDENTS OF CALIFORNIA

02:55:58.414 --> 02:56:00.182
BEING THE BEST STATE IN THE

02:56:00.249 --> 02:56:03.519
UNION? WELL, I OPPOSE AB 130. IT

02:56:03.586 --> 02:56:05.721
LITERALLY BRINGS US ALL THE WAY

02:56:05.788 --> 02:56:07.290
DOWN TO $24 AN HOUR. LET ME LET

02:56:07.356 --> 02:56:08.624
ME JUST HIT THAT REAL QUICK.

02:56:08.691 --> 02:56:10.559
THAT'S $49,000 A YEAR, WHICH

02:56:10.626 --> 02:56:13.029
PUTS YOU AT 50% OF THE AMI IN

02:56:13.095 --> 02:56:14.297
OUR REGION. IS THAT REALLY

02:56:14.363 --> 02:56:16.132
HELPING OUT OUR COMMUNITY? IT

02:56:16.198 --> 02:56:18.367
ISN'T. WE WILL BE ROLLING BACK

02:56:18.434 --> 02:56:20.236
DECADES AND DECADES OF UNION

02:56:20.303 --> 02:56:21.170

AND THE REPUBLICANS, TO SET THE

02:56:24.874 --> 02:56:25.641
STANDARD FOR THE WORKERS THAT

BUILD THIS GREAT STATE AND WHERE

02:56:27.410 --> 02:56:28.778
OUR PEOPLE WILL LIVE THERE. SO I

02:56:28.844 --> 02:56:30.479
URGE YOU TO HAVE SOME LEADERSHIP

02:56:30.546 --> 02:56:32.581
STAND STRONG AND DEMAND THAT

02:56:32.648 --> 02:56:34.550
THESE PREVAILING WAGES ARE

02:56:34.617 --> 02:56:36.686
ACTUALLY MEETING LIVING WAGES SO

02:56:36.752 --> 02:56:38.220

02:56:38.287 --> 02:56:39.622
THEY CAN THRIVE AND REACH A LOT

02:56:39.689 --> 02:56:41.257

NAME IS SEAN ELLIS, COMMUNITY

02:56:42.658 --> 02:56:45.094

02:56:50.466 --> 02:56:51.334
GOOD MORNING, MR. CHAIR, AND

02:56:51.400 --> 02:56:52.969
MEMBERS OF GRACIELA CASTILLO

02:56:53.035 --> 02:56:54.403
HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA

02:56:54.470 --> 02:56:56.238
HOUSING CONSORTIUM, ALL HOME

02:56:56.305 --> 02:56:57.640
ENTERPRISE COMMUNITY PARTNERS,

02:56:57.707 --> 02:56:59.075
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO DISAGREE

02:56:59.141 --> 02:57:00.977
WITH SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF THE

02:57:01.043 --> 02:57:02.979
PUBLIC. WE ACTUALLY THINK THAT

02:57:03.045 --> 02:57:03.512
THIS IS AN IMPROVEMENT FOR

02:57:03.579 --> 02:57:05.181
ACTUAL WORKERS. REMEMBER, THIS

02:57:05.247 --> 02:57:07.049
ACTUAL PROVISION IS FOR MARKET

02:57:07.116 --> 02:57:08.117
RATE DEVELOPMENT THAT CURRENTLY

02:57:08.184 --> 02:57:10.686
DOES NOT ACTUALLY PAY PREVAILING

02:57:10.753 --> 02:57:11.587
WAGE. WE THINK THAT THEY SHOULD

02:57:11.654 --> 02:57:13.522
PAY MORE. IT MIGHT NOT BE

02:57:13.589 --> 02:57:14.323
PREVAILING WAGE, BUT THIS IS A

02:57:14.390 --> 02:57:16.492
NEW STANDARD THAT CAN PUT MORE

02:57:16.559 --> 02:57:18.361
PEOPLE INTO WORK AND ALSO CREATE

02:57:18.427 --> 02:57:19.228
THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE WANT.

02:57:19.295 --> 02:57:20.363
WORKERS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE

02:57:20.429 --> 02:57:22.231
DRIVING TWO HOURS BECAUSE THAT'S

02:57:22.298 --> 02:57:23.132
ALL THEY CAN AFFORD. THEY

02:57:23.199 --> 02:57:24.433
ACTUALLY SHOULD BE ABLE TO WALK

02:57:24.500 --> 02:57:26.102
TO WORK. THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO

02:57:26.168 --> 02:57:28.437
COME HOME AND PUT THEIR KIDS TO

02:57:28.504 --> 02:57:30.072
BED. AND WE THINK THAT THE

02:57:30.139 --> 02:57:31.741
SOLUTIONS ARE IN 130. SO THANK

02:57:31.807 --> 02:57:33.075

02:57:33.142 --> 02:57:33.909

02:57:56.432 --> 02:57:57.733
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY TYPE OF

02:57:57.800 --> 02:57:59.035

02:58:06.876 --> 02:58:07.810

03:09:34.396 --> 03:09:36.765
ENOUGH AT THE TIME, THEY ALL HAD

03:10:40.896 --> 03:10:42.230
DIFFERENT AMOUNTS THROUGHOUT THE

03:11:23.104 --> 03:11:26.241
TO THAT WOULD HAVE A LOWER WAGE

03:11:26.308 --> 03:11:28.043
THAN THE MINIMUM WAGE FOR FAST

03:11:28.109 --> 03:11:29.911

CALIFORNIA, A LOWER WAGE THAN

03:11:32.447 --> 03:11:34.482
HEALTH CARE WORKERS. THE STATE

03:11:34.549 --> 03:11:35.884
BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADES

03:11:35.951 --> 03:11:37.452
COUNCIL SUPPORTS RAISING THE

03:11:37.519 --> 03:11:39.921
MINIMUM WAGE FOR ALL WORKERS IN

03:11:39.988 --> 03:11:42.057
CALIFORNIA. WE SUPPORT THOSE IN

03:11:42.123 --> 03:11:43.892
DIFFERENT SECTORS IF THEY THINK

03:11:43.959 --> 03:11:45.694
THAT WOULD UPLIFT WORKERS.

03:11:45.760 --> 03:11:47.462
SETTING A TWO TIERED WAGE

03:11:47.529 --> 03:11:49.631
SCHEDULE THAT THERE'S NO WAY TO

03:11:49.698 --> 03:11:51.433
ENFORCE UNTIL AFTER THE JOB IS

03:11:51.499 --> 03:11:52.400
OVER, BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW HOW

03:11:52.467 --> 03:11:54.469
MANY WORKERS, WE DON'T KNOW

03:11:54.536 --> 03:11:55.303
WHETHER IT'S WORKERS, WHETHER

03:11:55.370 --> 03:11:57.205
IT'S HOURS FIT INTO THE 60%, FIT

03:11:57.272 --> 03:11:59.341
INTO THE 40%. THERE'S NO

03:11:59.407 --> 03:12:02.244
CRITERIA TO DEDUCTING WAGES FOR

03:12:02.310 --> 03:12:04.813
HEALTH CARE, HEALTH CARE THAT

03:12:04.880 --> 03:12:06.681
FAMILIES NEED. PEOPLE NEED TO BE

03:12:06.748 --> 03:12:08.183
HEALTHY IN THE STATE OF

03:12:08.250 --> 03:12:09.451
CALIFORNIA, A VALUE OF THE STATE

03:12:09.517 --> 03:12:11.286
OF CALIFORNIA. WE'RE GOING TO

03:12:11.353 --> 03:12:11.853
LET EMPLOYERS DEDUCT. WE'RE

03:12:11.920 --> 03:12:13.488
GOING TO LET EMPLOYERS AND

03:12:13.555 --> 03:12:15.323
DEVELOPERS CHOOSE WHO GETS THE

03:12:15.390 --> 03:12:16.992
HIGHER WAGE, WHO GETS THE LOWER

03:12:17.058 --> 03:12:18.526
WAGE BASED ON WHAT I DON'T KNOW

03:12:18.593 --> 03:12:20.295
WHAT. IT'S NOT BASED ON THE

03:12:20.362 --> 03:12:21.496
TRADE. IT'S NOT BASED ON THE

03:12:21.563 --> 03:12:24.199
SKILL. IT'S BASED ON ARBITRARY

03:12:24.266 --> 03:12:25.600
THINGS. COULD IT BE BASED ON THE

03:12:25.667 --> 03:12:27.602
COLOR OF YOUR HAIR, THE COLOR OF

03:12:27.669 --> 03:12:31.339
YOUR EYES, YOUR GENDER, YOUR

03:12:31.406 --> 03:12:33.875
AGE, YOUR OLDER WORKER? YOU'RE A

03:12:33.942 --> 03:12:36.811
YOUNGER WORKER, YOUR SEXUAL

03:12:36.878 --> 03:12:39.314
ORIENTATION, WHETHER YOU'RE A

03:12:39.381 --> 03:12:40.448
DEMOCRAT, WHETHER YOU'RE A

03:12:40.515 --> 03:12:41.816
REPUBLICAN, WHETHER YOU SUPPORT

03:12:41.883 --> 03:12:44.319
A UNION, WHETHER YOU'RE NOT,

03:12:44.386 --> 03:12:48.023
WHETHER YOU'RE A COMPANY PERSON.

03:12:48.089 --> 03:12:49.724
WHETHER YOU FEAR FOR YOUR STATUS

03:12:49.791 --> 03:12:52.594
IN THIS COUNTRY. WE TRY TO PUSH

03:12:52.661 --> 03:12:54.029
BACK ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

03:12:54.095 --> 03:12:55.363
BREAKING UP FAMILIES, BREAKING

03:12:55.430 --> 03:12:57.299
UP COMMUNITIES. THIS BILL WILL

03:12:57.365 --> 03:12:59.634
SET UP A MINIMUM WAGE STRUCTURE

03:12:59.701 --> 03:13:01.603
THAT WILL ALLOW EMPLOYERS TO

03:13:01.670 --> 03:13:03.505
PUNISH WORKERS, WORKERS THAT ARE

03:13:03.571 --> 03:13:05.407
AFRAID OF THEIR STATUS, WORKERS

03:13:05.473 --> 03:13:07.108
THAT ARE AFRAID TO GET ON THAT

03:13:07.175 --> 03:13:09.878
NEXT JOB, TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A

03:13:09.945 --> 03:13:11.746
LIVING. WORKERS THAT WOULD

03:13:11.813 --> 03:13:12.814
BENEFIT FROM REGISTERED

03:13:12.881 --> 03:13:14.215
APPRENTICESHIP, LEARNING THEIR

03:13:14.282 --> 03:13:15.984
CRAFT SO THAT THEY COULD BE

03:13:16.051 --> 03:13:18.320
PRODUCTIVE BEYOND A TASK OR ONE

03:13:18.386 --> 03:13:20.789
PROJECT FOR THEIR CAREER. IT IS

03:13:20.855 --> 03:13:22.123
INSULTING. AND WHY IS THE

03:13:22.190 --> 03:13:23.425
BUILDING TRADES NOT AT THE

03:13:23.491 --> 03:13:24.926
TABLE? BECAUSE WE DEMAND

03:13:24.993 --> 03:13:27.429
PREVAILING WAGE AS A FLOOR. THE

03:13:27.495 --> 03:13:28.596
CRAFTS THAT HAVE RESIDENTIAL

03:13:28.663 --> 03:13:30.465
PREVAILING WAGE, REGISTERED

03:13:30.532 --> 03:13:31.599
APPRENTICESHIP. THAT'S THE

03:13:31.666 --> 03:13:32.467
FLOOR. WE'RE NOT AT THE TABLE

03:13:32.534 --> 03:13:34.336
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE.

03:13:34.402 --> 03:13:36.638
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH PROFIT TO

03:13:36.705 --> 03:13:38.406
COMPLETELY BYPASS ENVIRONMENTAL

03:13:38.473 --> 03:13:39.507
LAW. WHETHER THAT'S SMART OR

03:13:39.574 --> 03:13:41.776
NOT, I WOULD ARGUE IT'S NOT

03:13:41.843 --> 03:13:43.712
SMART, BUT THAT IS INSULTING FOR

03:13:43.778 --> 03:13:45.981
ME TO BE ABLE TO REPRESENT OUR

03:13:46.047 --> 03:13:47.649
MEMBERSHIP IN PUBLIC COMMENT.

03:13:47.716 --> 03:13:49.517
FACING A MINIMUM WAGE THAT WE

03:13:49.584 --> 03:13:51.019
HAVEN'T ASKED FOR, WE DO NOT

03:13:51.086 --> 03:13:53.555
SUPPORT AND WILL NOT HELP UPLIFT

03:13:53.621 --> 03:13:56.091
WORKERS. IT WILL PERPETUATE

03:13:56.157 --> 03:13:57.826
DISCRIMINATION. IT WILL HARM

03:13:57.892 --> 03:13:59.561
OPPORTUNITIES. AND I'M GOING TO

03:13:59.627 --> 03:14:01.096
CLOSE WITH THIS BILL SHOULD BE

03:14:01.162 --> 03:14:02.831
VOTED DOWN. THIS BILL SHOULD BE

03:14:02.897 --> 03:14:04.432
PULLED AND IT SHOULD NOT COME

03:14:04.499 --> 03:14:06.101
BACK UP FOR DISCUSSION. WE

03:14:06.167 --> 03:14:07.702
SHOULDN'T HAVE A MORE ROBUST

03:14:07.769 --> 03:14:10.405
DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW TO SUPPRESS

03:14:10.472 --> 03:14:12.140
WAGES, HOW TO PREVENT

03:14:12.207 --> 03:14:13.742
OPPORTUNITIES AND BYPASS

03:14:13.808 --> 03:14:16.511
THOUGHTFUL STREAMLINING THAT WAS

03:14:16.578 --> 03:14:18.346
BUILT AROUND TRANSIT CENTERS,

03:14:18.413 --> 03:14:19.781
BUILT IN INFILL DEVELOPMENTS TO

03:14:19.848 --> 03:14:21.483
REDUCE TRAFFIC AND EFFECTS IN

03:14:21.549 --> 03:14:22.684
THE ENVIRONMENT AND UPLIFT

03:14:22.751 --> 03:14:23.852
WORKERS, AND INCLUDE AFFORDABLE

03:14:23.918 --> 03:14:25.353
HOUSING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU

03:14:25.420 --> 03:14:27.422
VERY MUCH. I KNOW WE HAVE A LOT

03:14:27.489 --> 03:14:29.057
OF STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT THIS.

03:14:29.124 --> 03:14:31.493
I'M JUST GOING TO I WANT TO I

03:14:31.559 --> 03:14:32.761
WANT TO BE FAIR TO EVERYBODY ON

03:14:32.827 --> 03:14:34.295
ALL SIDES. SO JUST ASKING PEOPLE

03:14:34.362 --> 03:14:35.430
TO BE MINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT

03:14:35.497 --> 03:14:38.133
WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS TO

03:14:38.199 --> 03:14:39.167
MAKE PUBLIC COMMENT. SO THANK

03:14:39.234 --> 03:14:41.036
YOU ALL AND THANK YOU ALL FOR

03:14:41.102 --> 03:14:41.603
BEING HERE. MIKE HARTLEY,

03:14:41.669 --> 03:14:43.304
CALIFORNIA STATE PIPE TRADES

03:14:43.371 --> 03:14:43.972
COUNCIL I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH

03:14:44.039 --> 03:14:45.240
EVERYTHING CHRIS SAID, BUT

03:14:45.306 --> 03:14:46.307
THERE'S SOMETHING HERE. I ALSO

03:14:46.374 --> 03:14:48.109
WANT TO SAY THAT HE DIDN'T BRING

03:14:48.176 --> 03:14:50.445
UP. YOU SAY THIS IS TO HELP FOR

03:14:50.512 --> 03:14:51.312
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AFFORDABLE

03:14:51.379 --> 03:14:52.414
FOR WHO? WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO

03:14:52.480 --> 03:14:53.848
LOWER THE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS,

03:14:53.915 --> 03:14:55.283
WAGE THE HOUSES THAT THEY BUILD,

03:14:55.350 --> 03:14:56.484
THEY CAN'T AFFORD BECAUSE YOU'RE

03:14:56.551 --> 03:14:58.520
GOING TO LOWER THE WAGE. THAT'S

03:14:58.586 --> 03:14:59.387
NOT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THAT'S

03:14:59.454 --> 03:15:01.623
NOT HELPING ANYBODY IN THE

03:15:01.689 --> 03:15:02.991
ENTIRE COMMUNITY. BECAUSE IF

03:15:03.058 --> 03:15:04.459
EVERYBODY'S GETTING LESS WAGES

03:15:04.526 --> 03:15:06.161
THAN EVERYBODY'S PAYING FOR LESS

03:15:06.227 --> 03:15:08.763
THINGS, RIGHT? WE HAVE A LOT OF

03:15:08.830 --> 03:15:09.364
OTHER PROBLEMS AND A LOT OF

03:15:09.431 --> 03:15:11.566
OTHER ISSUES. THIS MAKES NO

03:15:11.633 --> 03:15:13.735
SENSE TO ME WHY WE'RE BEING

03:15:13.802 --> 03:15:15.537
INVOLVED. OUR ASSEMBLY IS

03:15:15.603 --> 03:15:17.639
GETTING INVOLVED IN SETTING

03:15:17.705 --> 03:15:21.042
RESIDENTIAL HOUSING WAGES. THANK

03:15:21.109 --> 03:15:27.549
YOU. PLEASE REFRAIN FROM ALOHA.

03:15:27.615 --> 03:15:28.416

IRONWORKERS IN OPPOSITION TO AB

03:15:32.587 --> 03:15:34.622
130. THIS IS A BAD BILL. IT'S

03:15:34.689 --> 03:15:36.424
HALF BAKED. THE ENFORCEMENT OF

03:15:36.491 --> 03:15:38.893
THE WAGES IS NOT ENFORCEABLE. IF

03:15:38.960 --> 03:15:40.495
YOU WERE A WORKER, YOU'RE NOT

03:15:40.562 --> 03:15:42.163
GOING TO GET AHEAD UNDER THESE

03:15:42.230 --> 03:15:43.598
NEW WAGES. NO HOUSES ARE GOING

03:15:43.665 --> 03:15:45.834
TO GET BUILT THAT ANY OF THESE

03:15:45.900 --> 03:15:47.602
WORKERS CAN ACTUALLY LIVE IN.

03:15:47.669 --> 03:15:49.537
THIS, AT THE END OF THE DAY, IS

03:15:49.604 --> 03:15:50.905
A CORPORATE GIVEAWAY ON THE

03:15:50.972 --> 03:15:54.476
BACKS OF WORKERS DISGUISED AS

03:15:54.542 --> 03:15:59.547
BEING AFFORDABLE, VOTED DOWN.

CONSTRUCTION WORKERS AND

03:16:18.533 --> 03:16:19.834
HOUSING. WE DO SEE THIS AS A

03:16:19.901 --> 03:16:21.035
ROLLBACK OF EXISTING PREVAILING

03:16:21.102 --> 03:16:22.871
WAGE THAT APPLIES TO CURRENTLY

03:16:22.937 --> 03:16:24.205
TO STREAMLINE HOUSING. AND WE DO

03:16:24.272 --> 03:16:25.773
NOT THINK THAT THE HOUSING

03:16:25.840 --> 03:16:26.574
CRISIS SHOULD BE SOLVED ON THE

03:16:26.641 --> 03:16:28.409
BACKS OF WORKERS WHO ARE

03:16:28.476 --> 03:16:29.277
EXPECTED TO FIX THE HOUSING

03:16:29.344 --> 03:16:31.045
CRISIS. WE URGE YOUR OPPOSITION.

ARE COMPRISED OF WOMEN, PEOPLE

03:16:43.925 --> 03:16:45.660

FROM THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND

03:16:48.396 --> 03:16:50.798
VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE ABLE

03:16:50.865 --> 03:16:51.733
TO PROVIDE THEM WITH

03:16:51.799 --> 03:16:53.334
APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING AND

03:16:53.401 --> 03:16:55.670
LIVABLE WAGES. THEY SHOULD HAVE

03:16:55.737 --> 03:16:57.372
THE RIGHT TO LIVE IN THE

03:16:57.438 --> 03:16:58.606
COMMUNITIES AND WHERE THEY WORK,

03:16:58.673 --> 03:16:59.607
AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH

03:16:59.674 --> 03:17:02.110
THEY BUILD. ÁP 130 WOULD PREVENT

03:17:02.177 --> 03:17:04.746
THIS AND HINDER THAT PROCESS. SO

03:17:04.812 --> 03:17:06.347
WE URGE YOU TO OPPOSE THIS.

03:30:36.690 --> 03:30:38.926
WERE TO PASS AS IN PRINT, IT

03:30:38.993 --> 03:30:40.794
WOULD EFFECTIVELY MAKE OUR

03:30:40.861 --> 03:30:42.329
CONTRACTORS NO LONGER

03:30:42.396 --> 03:30:45.265
COMPETITIVE AND PROHIBITIVE OF

THEIR ABILITY TO BID THESE

03:30:47.935 --> 03:30:49.169
PROJECTS. UNTIL THOSE AGREEMENTS

03:30:49.236 --> 03:30:51.505
EITHER ARE TERMINATED OR

03:30:51.572 --> 03:30:53.374
EXPIRED, WHICH WOULD BE TO THE

03:30:53.440 --> 03:30:54.775
DETRIMENT OF OUR UNION

03:30:54.842 --> 03:30:56.977
EMPLOYEES. SO FOR THOSE REASONS,

03:30:57.044 --> 03:30:58.312
WE URGE YOUR NO VOTE ON THAT

03:30:58.379 --> 03:31:01.548
PROVISION. THANK YOU. HELLO, MR.

OVERTIME PAY FOR IHSS. THAT

03:31:18.665 --> 03:31:22.436
WOULD HAVE BEEN REALLY BAD. BAD

03:31:22.503 --> 03:31:23.604
POLICY MOVE. SO THANK YOU FOR

03:31:23.670 --> 03:31:24.938

REGARDING STATEWIDE BARGAINING.

03:31:36.984 --> 03:31:38.185
IN FACT, IT WOULD TAKE US

03:31:38.252 --> 03:31:39.653
BACKWARD. WE DON'T NEED TO STUDY

03:31:39.720 --> 03:31:41.321

ARE OPEN AND RUNNING AND SERVING

03:32:08.248 --> 03:32:09.216
OUR CONSTITUENTS, BOTH DURING

03:32:09.283 --> 03:32:10.417

RESPECT OF OPPOSITION TO AB 130,

03:32:19.426 --> 03:32:20.194
SPECIFICALLY, THE PROVISIONS

03:32:20.260 --> 03:32:21.595
THAT INCORPORATE THE BUILDING

03:32:21.662 --> 03:32:22.896

AND THE SPEAKER'S OFFICE OVER

03:32:27.768 --> 03:32:29.303
THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS TO

03:32:29.369 --> 03:32:31.105
EXPRESS OUR CONCERNS AND HOW

03:32:31.171 --> 03:32:31.738
THIS WE THINK THIS WILL RAISE

03:32:31.805 --> 03:32:33.640
COSTS AND WILL ACTUALLY HAMPER

03:32:33.707 --> 03:32:35.042
EFFORTS TO TRANSITION HOME

03:32:35.109 --> 03:32:36.877
HEATING APPLIANCES TO CLEANER

03:32:36.944 --> 03:32:39.446
ALTERNATIVES. AND SO WE URGE THE

03:32:39.513 --> 03:32:40.848
LEGISLATURE TO RETURN THAT TO

03:32:40.914 --> 03:32:42.850
THE REGULAR POLICY PROCESS. BUT

03:32:42.916 --> 03:32:47.354
THANK YOU. HI. MY NAME IS

03:32:47.421 --> 03:32:48.755
MICHAEL MCGAFFIGAN. I'M A VICE

03:32:48.822 --> 03:32:50.591
PRESIDENT WITH A COMPANY CALLED

03:32:50.657 --> 03:32:51.725
ENERGY SOLUTIONS. WE ARE

03:32:51.792 --> 03:32:53.060
CALIFORNIA BASED, MISSION DRIVEN

03:32:53.127 --> 03:32:55.229
COMPANY WORKING ON EQUITABLE

03:32:55.295 --> 03:32:56.163
DECARBONIZATION AND GREENHOUSE

03:32:56.230 --> 03:32:58.866
GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS

03:32:58.932 --> 03:33:00.767
PROGRAMS. AND I AM HERE TO

03:33:00.834 --> 03:33:03.237
OPPOSE AB 130, UNLESS AMENDED,

03:33:03.303 --> 03:33:05.038
TO REMOVE LANGUAGE FROM AB 306

03:33:05.105 --> 03:33:06.006
RELATED TO BUILDING CODE

03:33:06.073 --> 03:33:08.308
DEVELOPMENT. WE SUPPORT THE

03:33:08.375 --> 03:33:10.377
GOALS OF INCREASED HOUSING AND

03:33:10.444 --> 03:33:11.512
SUPPORTING FIRE REBUILDS. BUT

03:33:11.578 --> 03:33:12.846
PAUSING THE STATE'S BUILDING

03:33:12.913 --> 03:33:14.548
ENERGY CODE WILL NOT ACCOMPLISH

03:33:14.615 --> 03:33:16.583
THOSE GOALS. ENERGY CODES

03:33:16.650 --> 03:33:18.519
ACTUALLY REDUCE ENERGY USE AND

03:33:18.585 --> 03:33:20.821
UTILITY BILL INCREASE UTILITY

03:33:20.888 --> 03:33:24.491
BILL SAVINGS. SO, AS WRITTEN,

03:33:24.558 --> 03:33:26.593
THIS BILL WILL INCREASE COSTS

03:33:26.660 --> 03:33:27.794
FOR CALIFORNIANS AND WORSEN OUR

03:33:27.861 --> 03:33:30.364
ENERGY AFFORDABILITY CRISIS. IT

03:33:30.430 --> 03:33:32.332
WILL ALSO RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT

03:33:32.399 --> 03:33:33.734
INCREASES IN GREENHOUSE GAS

03:33:33.800 --> 03:33:35.369
EMISSIONS, REQUIRE THE STATE TO

03:33:35.435 --> 03:33:37.371
ADD POWER PLANTS TO THE GRID.

03:33:37.437 --> 03:33:39.139
IT'S ALSO A SIGNIFICANT POLICY

03:33:39.206 --> 03:33:40.541
PROPOSAL BEING CONSIDERED

03:33:40.607 --> 03:33:42.476
THROUGH A BUDGET BILL, WHICH IS

03:33:42.543 --> 03:33:44.278
WE DO NOT SUPPORT THAT PROCESS

03:33:44.344 --> 03:33:47.481
EITHER. SO RESPECTFULLY, WE

03:33:47.548 --> 03:33:49.316
STRONGLY OPPOSE THE ADDITION OF

03:33:49.383 --> 03:33:52.619
LANGUAGE FROM AB 306 IN AB 130.

03:33:52.686 --> 03:33:54.288
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE

03:33:54.354 --> 03:33:57.958

03:34:28.956 --> 03:34:30.057
HOWEVER, WE'VE GOT SERIOUS

03:34:30.123 --> 03:34:31.491
THREATS COMING DOWN FROM THE

03:34:31.558 --> 03:34:33.493
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COMING AFTER

03:34:33.560 --> 03:34:35.429

03:37:26.500 --> 03:37:27.501
CONCERNS AROUND THE CLEAN CARS

03:37:27.567 --> 03:37:29.236
FOR ALL CHANGES. WE ARE A

03:37:29.302 --> 03:37:30.604
PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR FOR TWO OF

03:37:30.670 --> 03:37:32.272
THE AIR DISTRICTS AS WELL AS

03:37:32.339 --> 03:37:33.774
WITH THE STATEWIDE PROGRAM. WE

03:37:33.840 --> 03:37:35.409
DON'T THINK THAT THE PROGRAM

03:37:35.475 --> 03:37:36.443
SHOULD BE CANNIBALIZING EACH

03:37:36.510 --> 03:37:37.477
OTHER, OR WE RISK HAVING CLEAN

03:37:37.544 --> 03:37:40.480
CARS FOR SOME, AND WE WANT TO

03:37:40.547 --> 03:37:41.148
AVOID THAT. THE FINANCING

03:37:41.214 --> 03:37:42.249
ASSISTANCE STATEWIDE HAS PROVED

03:37:42.315 --> 03:37:44.084
TO BE VERY POPULAR. WE BELIEVE

03:37:44.151 --> 03:37:45.752
THAT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

03:37:45.819 --> 03:37:46.787
LIKELY TO TAKE AWAY ELECTRIC

03:37:46.853 --> 03:37:48.088
VEHICLE TAX CREDITS, THIS IS

03:37:48.155 --> 03:37:50.056
GOING TO BE THE LARGEST

03:37:50.123 --> 03:37:51.091
INCENTIVE THAT WE HAVE LEFT IN

03:37:51.158 --> 03:37:52.592
THE STATE. AND WE BELIEVE THAT

03:37:52.659 --> 03:37:53.727
YOU SHOULD DEVOTE MORE

03:37:53.794 --> 03:37:55.896
GREENHOUSE GAS FUND MONIES TO

03:37:55.962 --> 03:37:57.330
MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP THESE

03:37:57.397 --> 03:37:59.266
PROGRAMS STRONG AT THE STATE

03:37:59.332 --> 03:38:01.101
LEVEL AND AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL.

03:38:01.168 --> 03:38:03.336
THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON. MY

03:38:03.403 --> 03:38:04.371
NAME IS TIMOTHY BURR, AND I'M

03:38:04.438 --> 03:38:06.573
HERE ON BEHALF OF A COALITION OF

03:38:06.640 --> 03:38:07.474
PRIVATE DUTY NURSING PROVIDERS

03:38:07.541 --> 03:38:09.309
SUCH AS MAXAM HEALTHCARE, AVIANA

03:38:09.376 --> 03:38:10.544
HEALTHCARE AND PRIME HOME

03:38:10.610 --> 03:38:12.479
HEALTH. MEDI-CAL RATES FOR PCN

03:38:12.546 --> 03:38:14.214
IN CALIFORNIA ARE SOME OF THE

03:38:14.281 --> 03:38:15.582
LOWEST IN THE WESTERN UNITED

03:38:15.649 --> 03:38:16.116
STATES, PUTTING MEDICALLY

03:38:16.183 --> 03:38:17.818
FRAGILE CHILDREN AT RISK, MANY

03:38:17.884 --> 03:38:19.519
OF WHOM REQUIRE VENTILATORS OR

03:38:19.586 --> 03:38:21.154
TRACHEOSTOMY CARE TO SURVIVE. WE

03:38:21.221 --> 03:38:22.489
ARE DISAPPOINTED THIS BUDGET

03:38:22.556 --> 03:38:24.357
DOES NOT INCLUDE AN INVESTMENT

03:38:24.424 --> 03:38:26.193
IN PTEN AND PROVIDE A PATH TO

03:38:26.259 --> 03:38:27.093
BRING THESE KIDS HOME. MISTER

03:38:27.160 --> 03:38:29.396
CHAIR AND MEMBERS, WE HAVE AN

03:38:29.463 --> 03:38:30.697
OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE THE STATE

03:38:30.764 --> 03:38:32.065
MONEY IN THIS DIFFICULT

03:38:32.132 --> 03:38:33.700
BUDGETARY YEAR. WE CAN MOVE

03:38:33.767 --> 03:38:34.568
MEDICALLY FRAGILE CHILDREN OUT

03:38:34.634 --> 03:38:36.436
OF THE HOSPITALS AND SAVE THE

03:38:36.503 --> 03:38:38.972
STATE $175 MILLION ANNUALLY.

03:38:39.039 --> 03:38:41.508
I'LL SAY IT AGAIN A 40%

03:38:41.575 --> 03:38:43.009
REIMBURSEMENT RATE INCREASE FOR

03:38:43.076 --> 03:38:45.946
PCN WILL SAVE CALIFORNIA $175

03:38:46.012 --> 03:38:47.614
MILLION ANNUALLY, AND THE STATE

03:38:47.681 --> 03:38:49.182
WILL RECEIVE A RETURN ON THIS

03:38:49.249 --> 03:38:50.851
INVESTMENT IN JUST EIGHT MONTHS.

03:38:50.917 --> 03:38:52.719
LAST YEAR, THE CALIFORNIA

03:38:52.786 --> 03:38:54.154
LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR

03:38:54.221 --> 03:38:55.222
RECOGNIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF

03:38:55.288 --> 03:38:57.324
THIS INVESTMENT IN PTEN AND

03:38:57.390 --> 03:38:58.825
INCLUDED A $62 MILLION

03:38:58.892 --> 03:39:00.360
INVESTMENT IN THE BUDGET TO HELP

03:39:00.427 --> 03:39:02.062
KEEP CHILDREN OUT OF THE

03:39:02.128 --> 03:39:03.230
HOSPITAL AND AT HOME WITH THEIR

03:39:03.296 --> 03:39:05.265
FAMILIES. THE PASSAGE OF PROP 35

03:39:05.332 --> 03:39:06.700
NULLIFIED THIS INCREASE. THERE

03:39:06.766 --> 03:39:08.468
ARE OVER 1000 KIDS IN CALIFORNIA

03:39:08.535 --> 03:39:09.936
EITHER WAITING IN HOSPITALS FOR

03:39:10.003 --> 03:39:12.172
PTEN SERVICES AT HOME OR AT

03:39:12.239 --> 03:39:13.507
HOME. WITHOUT THIS CRITICAL

03:39:13.573 --> 03:39:15.475
CARE, KIDS DO NOT DESERVE TO

03:39:15.542 --> 03:39:17.210
SPEND THE REST OF THEIR LIVES IN

03:39:17.277 --> 03:39:19.045
HOSPITALS AS A STATE CHOOSES A

03:39:19.112 --> 03:39:20.380
MORE COSTLY ALTERNATIVE.

03:39:20.447 --> 03:39:22.849
INVESTING IN PTEN IS FISCALLY

03:39:22.916 --> 03:39:26.119
AND MORALLY SOUND. THANK YOU.

03:39:26.186 --> 03:39:27.988
MR. CHAIR AND MEMBERS. MATTHEW

03:39:28.054 --> 03:39:28.755
SEIBERLING, ON BEHALF OF THE LOS

03:39:28.822 --> 03:39:29.756
ANGELES PROBATION OFFICERS

03:39:29.823 --> 03:39:31.958
UNION, ASKED ME LOCAL 685. WE

03:39:32.025 --> 03:39:33.693
STAND HERE TODAY OPPOSED TO A

03:39:33.760 --> 03:39:35.529
NEW LANGUAGE ADDED TO ASSEMBLY

03:39:35.595 --> 03:39:36.630
BILL 118, WHICH DEALS WITH THE

03:39:36.696 --> 03:39:37.998
SUITABILITY OF JUVENILE

03:39:38.064 --> 03:39:40.534
FACILITIES FOR PROBATIONERS.

03:39:40.600 --> 03:39:42.135
BASICALLY, THE PREVIOUS VERSIONS

03:39:42.202 --> 03:39:43.436
OF THIS BILL CONTAIN LANGUAGE WE

03:39:43.503 --> 03:39:45.138
ACTUALLY ACTIVELY SUPPORTED,

03:39:45.205 --> 03:39:46.306
WHICH WOULD HAVE PROVIDED

03:39:46.373 --> 03:39:47.574
CONSEQUENCES AND INCENTIVES FOR

03:39:47.641 --> 03:39:49.543
COUNTIES TO ACTUALLY COMPLY WITH

03:39:49.609 --> 03:39:50.377
RECOMMENDATIONS AND DIRECTIVES

03:39:50.443 --> 03:39:51.478
FOUND THROUGH AUDITS ON

03:39:51.545 --> 03:39:53.146
SUITABILITY OF FACILITIES. THE

03:39:53.213 --> 03:39:55.048
NEW BILL ESSENTIALLY JUST CUTS

03:39:55.115 --> 03:39:57.751
OFF THE FUNDING ALTOGETHER,

03:39:57.817 --> 03:39:59.553
ULTIMATELY HARMING THE CLIENTS

03:39:59.619 --> 03:40:01.721
THAT WE SERVE IN THE PROBATION

03:40:01.788 --> 03:40:05.091
SYSTEM AND WE OPPOSE. THANK YOU.

03:40:05.158 --> 03:40:06.526
GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS JOHN

03:40:06.593 --> 03:40:08.295
HERSHEY WITH UA LOCAL 447

03:40:08.361 --> 03:40:09.796
PLUMBERS AND PIPEFITTERS HERE IN

03:40:09.863 --> 03:40:11.531
SACRAMENTO. I JUST WANT TO SAY

03:40:11.598 --> 03:40:13.667
THAT WE ARE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO

03:40:13.733 --> 03:40:15.502
EXPRESS HOW MUCH WE ARE OPPOSED

03:40:15.569 --> 03:40:17.304
TO AB 130, BUT I JUST WANT TO

03:40:17.370 --> 03:40:18.338
HIGHLIGHT, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

03:40:18.405 --> 03:40:20.473
SAID THAT THE PROVISIONS THAT

03:40:20.540 --> 03:40:22.309
EXEMPT PROJECTS FROM PREVAILING

03:40:22.375 --> 03:40:23.610
WAGE COVERAGE ARE THAT THEY'RE

03:40:23.677 --> 03:40:25.612
UNDER OR THAT THEY'RE UNDER 85FT

03:40:25.679 --> 03:40:28.815
IN HEIGHT, THAT ARE NOT 100%

03:40:28.882 --> 03:40:30.617
LOW, LOW INCOME HOUSING. NOW,

03:40:30.684 --> 03:40:32.152
YOUR TYPICAL FIVE OVER ONE

03:40:32.218 --> 03:40:34.888
APARTMENT BUILDING DOESN'T REACH

03:40:34.955 --> 03:40:36.289
85FT, AND THAT WOULD PRETTY MUCH

03:40:36.356 --> 03:40:38.525
EXEMPT MOST PUBLIC WORKS HOUSING

03:40:38.592 --> 03:40:39.926
PROJECTS FROM PREVAILING WAGE

03:40:39.993 --> 03:40:42.462
LAWS, WHICH ALSO IMPACT

03:40:42.529 --> 03:40:43.630
APPRENTICESHIP COLLECTION FOR

03:40:43.697 --> 03:40:46.099
THAT COULD IMPACT THE CALIFORNIA

03:40:46.166 --> 03:40:46.933
APPRENTICESHIP COUNCIL, WHICH

03:40:47.000 --> 03:40:49.002
THEN FUNDS UNILATERAL AND JOINT

03:40:49.069 --> 03:40:49.703
APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING

03:40:49.769 --> 03:40:51.438
COMMITTEES ACROSS THE STATE. AND

03:40:51.504 --> 03:40:53.173
SO THE UNFORESEEN KNOCK ON

03:40:53.239 --> 03:40:54.774
EFFECTS HAVE NOT BEEN REALLY

03:40:54.841 --> 03:40:57.577
REALIZED IN THIS LEGISLATION.

03:40:57.644 --> 03:40:59.446
ADDITIONALLY, THE FLAT RATES DO

03:40:59.512 --> 03:41:02.382
NOT INCLUDE ANY MENTION TO

03:41:02.449 --> 03:41:03.717
APPRENTICESHIP OR THOSE PAYMENTS

03:41:03.783 --> 03:41:05.085
AND IS NOT CONGRUENT TO ANY

03:41:05.151 --> 03:41:06.252
EXISTING BUILDING TRADES

03:41:06.319 --> 03:41:07.320
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM,

03:41:07.387 --> 03:41:10.590
INCLUDING RATIOS. WE STRONGLY

03:41:10.657 --> 03:41:12.559
OPPOSE THIS BILL AS IT EXISTS.

03:41:12.626 --> 03:41:15.629
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD

03:41:15.695 --> 03:41:17.430

WESTERN CENTER COLLEAGUE AND

03:41:25.839 --> 03:41:27.407
SOME OF OUR PARTNERS ON THE END

03:41:27.474 --> 03:41:28.908
CHILD POVERTY CALIFORNIA

03:41:28.975 --> 03:41:30.343
COALITION. WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL

03:41:30.410 --> 03:41:32.979
FOR THE REJECTION OF MANY OF THE

03:41:33.046 --> 03:41:34.247
CUTS IN THE MAY REVISION, BUT WE

03:41:34.314 --> 03:41:35.348
REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT THE CUTS

03:41:35.415 --> 03:41:36.650
THAT WOULD STILL SIGNIFICANTLY

03:41:36.716 --> 03:41:38.284
IMPACT IMMIGRANT CALIFORNIANS

03:41:38.351 --> 03:41:39.486
WHO ARE ALREADY UNDER ATTACK

03:41:39.552 --> 03:41:40.787
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT,

03:41:40.854 --> 03:41:42.622
INCLUDING CUTS TO MEDI-CAL. WE

03:41:42.689 --> 03:41:44.758

WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE

03:41:50.263 --> 03:41:51.631
LEGISLATURE'S LEADERSHIP IN

03:41:51.698 --> 03:41:53.066
INVESTING IN CHILDREN AND

03:41:53.133 --> 03:41:54.801

THE EFFORTS TO MAXIMIZE

03:42:07.080 --> 03:42:08.148
UTILIZATION OF THE UNIVERSAL

BOOKS TO PREVENT CHILD HUNGER.

03:42:14.354 --> 03:42:16.056
WE'RE ALSO EXCITED ABOUT THE

03:42:16.122 --> 03:42:16.756
LEGISLATURE'S PLAN TO FURTHER

03:42:16.823 --> 03:42:18.191
STREAMLINE AND REIMAGINE

03:42:18.258 --> 03:42:19.526

TO PROGRESSIVELY RAISE REVENUES.

03:42:30.570 --> 03:42:31.871
BUT THIS BUDGET STILL NEGLECTS

03:42:31.938 --> 03:42:33.740
TO ADOPT THE NECESSARY REVENUE

03:42:33.807 --> 03:42:35.275
SOLUTIONS TO EFFECTIVELY SUPPORT

03:42:35.341 --> 03:42:37.644

CRITICALLY CHALLENGED OPERATORS

03:43:15.181 --> 03:43:16.716
RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF THEIR

REALLY HINGE ON THE TIMELINE FOR

03:45:17.971 --> 03:45:19.372

PROVISIONS OF THAT BILL THAT

03:45:34.587 --> 03:45:37.023
WERE INSTALLED INTO AB 130 BE

03:45:37.090 --> 03:45:38.391
RECONSTRUCTED AND PUT INTO A

OPPOSITION TO THE LABOR TRAILER

03:45:55.608 --> 03:45:58.845
BILL 129. UNFORTUNATELY, WHILE

03:45:58.912 --> 03:46:00.747
WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE 3.3

03:46:00.813 --> 03:46:02.482
MILLION INCLUSION INTO THE

03:46:02.548 --> 03:46:04.317
BUDGET FOR STATEWIDE COLLECTIVE

03:46:04.384 --> 03:46:05.718
BARGAINING, THE LANGUAGE THAT'S

03:46:05.785 --> 03:46:07.353
CAPTURED IN 129 THE LABOR

03:46:07.420 --> 03:46:09.455
TRAILER BILL IS NOT IT. WE HAVE

03:46:09.522 --> 03:46:10.623
NOT AGREED TO THAT LANGUAGE.

03:46:10.690 --> 03:46:12.458
WE'RE NOT THERE YET. I'M HOPEFUL

03:46:12.525 --> 03:46:14.527
THAT WE CAN GET THERE, BUT WE

03:46:14.594 --> 03:46:16.429
NEED A LITTLE BIT OF TIME IN

03:46:16.496 --> 03:46:17.664
ORDER TO GET THERE. SO THE

03:46:17.730 --> 03:46:19.132
REQUEST WOULD BE FOR YOU GUYS TO

03:46:19.198 --> 03:46:20.266
HOLD 129 THE LABOR BILL IN

03:46:20.333 --> 03:46:22.602
COMMITTEE, ALLOWING US THE

03:46:22.669 --> 03:46:23.503
OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO FLESH

03:46:23.569 --> 03:46:24.704
OUT THAT LANGUAGE RELATED TO

03:46:24.771 --> 03:46:25.338
STATEWIDE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING.

03:46:25.405 --> 03:46:28.841
THANK YOU SO MUCH. MR. CHAIRMAN.

DANNY CURTIN WITH THE CALIFORNIA

03:46:30.310 --> 03:46:32.478
COUNCIL OF CARPENTERS AND

03:46:32.545 --> 03:46:33.880
REMAINING MEMBERS HERE. THANK

03:46:33.947 --> 03:46:35.748
YOU FOR HANGING IN. BEAR WITH ME

03:46:35.815 --> 03:46:38.184
FOR A MINUTE. I WON'T TAKE LONG,

03:46:38.251 --> 03:46:39.585
BUT I DO THINK I HAVE TO ADDRESS

03:46:39.652 --> 03:46:41.521
A COUPLE OF THE ISSUES. FIRST OF

03:46:41.587 --> 03:46:42.455
ALL, THANK YOU FOR KEEPING

03:46:42.522 --> 03:46:44.390
HOUSING AS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE.

03:46:44.457 --> 03:46:45.959
IT IS THE MOST DESTABILIZING

03:46:46.025 --> 03:46:47.527
ISSUE THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE

03:46:47.593 --> 03:46:49.228
RIGHT NOW. AND IT'S A VERY

03:46:49.295 --> 03:46:52.598
COMPLICATED PROBLEM. I DO WANT

03:46:52.665 --> 03:46:54.067
TO RESPECT THE POSITION THAT

03:46:54.133 --> 03:46:56.069
MANY OF THE MEMBERS ARE

03:46:56.135 --> 03:46:57.170
AFFILIATES AND COLLEAGUES OF

03:46:57.236 --> 03:46:58.938
MINE TOOK ON BEHALF OF

03:46:59.005 --> 03:47:01.174
PREVAILING WAGES HERE, BUT I

03:47:01.240 --> 03:47:03.609
WANT TO SAY I'VE BEEN DOING THIS

03:47:03.676 --> 03:47:07.313
SINCE 1985. I KNOW SOME OF YOU

03:47:07.380 --> 03:47:08.648
MIGHT HAVE REMEMBERED THAT, BUT

03:47:08.715 --> 03:47:11.217
WE HAVE THE MOST SUBSTANTIAL

03:47:11.284 --> 03:47:13.019
PREVAILING WAGE LAWS IN THE

03:47:13.086 --> 03:47:15.254
COUNTRY, AND WE HAVE BEEN A PART

03:47:15.321 --> 03:47:16.656
OF THAT. THE CARPENTERS ACTUALLY

03:47:16.723 --> 03:47:18.024
PASSED MANY OF THESE BILLS WITH

03:47:18.091 --> 03:47:19.559
THE SUPPORT OF THE TRADES, IN

03:47:19.625 --> 03:47:21.995
SOME CASES NOT SO MUCH, BUT JUST

03:47:22.061 --> 03:47:23.730
DEFINITELY. AND WE WOULDN'T BE

03:47:23.796 --> 03:47:25.665
UP HERE. TRUST ME, I WOULD NOT

03:47:25.732 --> 03:47:27.633
BE HERE SAYING THAT THIS IS A

03:47:27.700 --> 03:47:29.402
BILL WE SUPPORT AND IT MIGHT

03:47:29.469 --> 03:47:31.070
HURT PREVAILING WAGES. IT WILL

03:47:31.137 --> 03:47:32.505
NOT. AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE

03:47:32.572 --> 03:47:33.339
THAT'S PERFECTLY CLEAR IN THE

03:47:33.406 --> 03:47:35.208
BILL ITSELF. IT SAYS THE WAGES

03:47:35.274 --> 03:47:36.542
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WILL

03:47:36.609 --> 03:47:38.277
NOT BE UTILIZED IN THE

03:47:38.344 --> 03:47:39.345
DETERMINATION OF PREVAILING

03:47:39.412 --> 03:47:40.780
WAGES. AND I COULD EXPLAIN ALL

03:47:40.847 --> 03:47:42.648
THAT, BUT IT TAKES FOREVER, AND

03:47:42.715 --> 03:47:44.717
I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. I

03:47:44.784 --> 03:47:48.321
AM HERE TO SAY, THOUGH, THERE'S

03:47:48.388 --> 03:47:49.756
350,000 WORKING PEOPLE IN

03:47:49.822 --> 03:47:51.958
CALIFORNIA WHO BUILD HOMES,

03:47:52.025 --> 03:47:54.527
MAYBE MORE, MAYBE AS MUCH AS

03:47:54.594 --> 03:47:56.329
400,000. THAT'S LARGER THAN

03:47:56.396 --> 03:47:57.697
UNIONIZED CONSTRUCTION

03:47:57.764 --> 03:48:00.199
WORKFORCE. AND I ASK YOU TO LOOK

03:48:00.266 --> 03:48:01.300
INTO THE NUMBERS ON THAT, BUT

03:48:01.367 --> 03:48:02.568
IT'S NOT THE POINT. THEY DON'T

03:48:02.635 --> 03:48:04.570
HAVE REPRESENTATION HERE. NONE

03:48:04.637 --> 03:48:06.506
OF THE PEOPLE WHO GOT UP HERE

03:48:06.572 --> 03:48:07.807
REPRESENTING WORKERS ACTUALLY

03:48:07.874 --> 03:48:09.575
REPRESENT THOSE WORKERS. IT'S A

03:48:09.642 --> 03:48:11.711
VIRTUALLY NONUNION INDUSTRY. IT

03:48:11.778 --> 03:48:15.815
IS A CRIME SCENE WITH LAWS

03:48:15.882 --> 03:48:18.618
BROKEN RAMPANT ACCORDING BY IN A

03:48:18.684 --> 03:48:19.318
RAMPANT FASHION, ACCORDING TO

03:48:19.385 --> 03:48:20.987
THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL

03:48:21.054 --> 03:48:22.855
RELATIONS, INCLUDING WAGES NØ

03:48:22.922 --> 03:48:24.690
PAYROLL RECORDS. HOWEVER YOU

03:48:24.757 --> 03:48:27.593
WANT TO LOOK AT IT, YOU HAVE THE

03:48:27.660 --> 03:48:29.762
ABILITY TO GIVE THOSE PEOPLE A

03:48:29.829 --> 03:48:31.597
SUBSTANTIAL, MODEST, BUT

03:48:31.664 --> 03:48:33.132
SUBSTANTIAL AND IMPORTANT RAISE.

03:48:33.199 --> 03:48:35.034
I KNOW THE UNION MEMBERS, THE

03:48:35.101 --> 03:48:36.803
UNION LEADERS, ARE POOH POOHING

03:48:36.869 --> 03:48:39.105
THAT BECAUSE PREVAILING WAGE IS

03:48:39.172 --> 03:48:41.274
TWO, THREE, FOUR TIMES THAT

03:48:41.340 --> 03:48:43.576
RATE. WE HAVE TRIED THAT WAY. WE

03:48:43.643 --> 03:48:46.112
WERE HERE FOR 2011. WE HELPED

03:48:46.179 --> 03:48:47.613
WITH 2011. IN FACT, WE GENERATED

03:48:47.680 --> 03:48:49.916
IT IN THE BEGINNING. IT'S NOT

03:48:49.982 --> 03:48:51.417
WORKING THE WAY IT NEEDS TO

03:48:51.484 --> 03:48:53.586
WORK. IT DOESN'T ERASE 2011, BUT

03:48:53.653 --> 03:48:55.688
IT GIVES AN OPTION. I'LL BE DONE

03:48:55.755 --> 03:48:58.925
IN JUST A MOMENT. SO THE ISSUE

03:48:58.991 --> 03:49:01.427
IS THERE'S 350,000 WORKERS, A

03:49:01.494 --> 03:49:03.729
GOOD PORTION OF WHOM WILL

03:49:03.796 --> 03:49:05.698
RECEIVE A SUBSTANTIAL WAGE

03:49:05.765 --> 03:49:07.800
INCREASE. HOW DO YOU ENFORCE

03:49:07.867 --> 03:49:09.402
THIS? IT'S NOT ENFORCEABLE. WE

03:49:09.469 --> 03:49:12.138
SAY, WELL, THE WAGE ISSUES, THE

03:49:12.205 --> 03:49:14.040
LABOR ISSUES IN CONSTRUCTION ARE

03:49:14.107 --> 03:49:15.508
BARELY ENFORCED. NOW, YOU COULD

03:49:15.575 --> 03:49:16.976
ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL

03:49:17.043 --> 03:49:19.011
RELATIONS. THEY ARE OVERWHELMED.

03:49:19.078 --> 03:49:20.113
ONE OF THE ISSUES WE'VE

03:49:20.179 --> 03:49:21.581
DEVELOPED OVER THE YEARS IS THE

03:49:21.647 --> 03:49:23.816
ABILITY FOR UNIONS TO ACTUALLY

03:49:23.883 --> 03:49:26.352
DO ENFORCEMENT ON WAGE ISSUES IN

03:49:26.419 --> 03:49:27.987
CONSTRUCTION. THIS BILL WILL

03:49:28.054 --> 03:49:30.957
GIVE US MORE AUTHORITY TO

03:49:31.023 --> 03:49:33.025
ENFORCE THE WAGE LAWS, THE LABOR

03:49:33.092 --> 03:49:35.361
LAWS, THE WORKERS COMP LAWS, THE

03:49:35.428 --> 03:49:37.497
TAX PAYMENTS, YOU NAME IT. BUT

03:49:37.563 --> 03:49:39.332
THE UNIONS HAVE TO STEP IN AND

03:49:39.398 --> 03:49:42.168
STEP UP TO DO THIS. SO THE

03:49:42.235 --> 03:49:44.036
WORKFORCE IN HOUSING WILL

03:49:44.103 --> 03:49:46.038
RECEIVE A DECENT WAGE, NOT

03:49:46.105 --> 03:49:47.473
ANYTHING NEAR WHAT THEY EARN AND

03:49:47.540 --> 03:49:49.275
THEY SHOULD EARN. BUT WE THEN

03:49:49.342 --> 03:49:51.110
HAVE TO DO THE ENFORCEMENT ON

03:49:51.177 --> 03:49:52.945
THAT. SO THIS IS NOT JUST A

03:49:53.012 --> 03:49:54.413
SIMPLE, OH, WE CAN'T DO IT.

03:49:54.480 --> 03:49:55.781
YEAH. THERE'S COMPLICATIONS. I

03:49:55.848 --> 03:49:56.883
APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS THAT

03:49:56.949 --> 03:49:59.385
WERE RAISED. ASSEMBLYMAN AND

03:49:59.452 --> 03:50:02.288
OTHERS. IT NEEDS A LITTLE BIT OF

03:50:02.355 --> 03:50:03.055
WORK. BUT THE PREMISE IS WE'RE

03:50:03.122 --> 03:50:04.857
NOT CUTTING WAGES. THIS IS A

03:50:04.924 --> 03:50:06.225
NONUNION WORKFORCE IN THE

03:50:06.292 --> 03:50:08.027
PRIVATE SECTOR. THIS WILL

03:50:08.094 --> 03:50:11.230
ACTUALLY ENHANCE PUBLIC SECTOR

03:50:11.297 --> 03:50:14.300
HOUSING BECAUSE OF THE VMT

03:50:14.367 --> 03:50:15.635
MITIGATION FUND THAT WILL

03:50:15.701 --> 03:50:17.003
TRIGGER PREVAILING WAGES AND

03:50:17.069 --> 03:50:19.272
PUBLIC WORKS. BUT IN PRIVATE

03:50:19.338 --> 03:50:21.741
SECTOR WE NEED HOUSING. THAT IS

03:50:21.807 --> 03:50:25.111
THE CRISIS OF THE DAY. AND TO

03:50:25.178 --> 03:50:27.180
INSIST THAT EVERYBODY MUST MAKE

03:50:27.246 --> 03:50:28.481
UNION WAGES IN AN INDUSTRY THAT

03:50:28.548 --> 03:50:30.983
THERE IS VIRTUALLY, MAYBE NOT

03:50:31.050 --> 03:50:32.885
COMPLETELY, BUT VIRTUALLY NO

03:50:32.952 --> 03:50:34.654
UNION PRESENCE IN THE PRIVATE

03:50:34.720 --> 03:50:36.956
SECTOR HOUSING INDUSTRY. WE GOT

03:50:37.023 --> 03:50:38.624
TO GET PAST THAT. THAT WAS WHY

03:50:38.691 --> 03:50:41.127
WE DECIDED TO WORK WITH PEOPLE

03:50:41.194 --> 03:50:42.795
WHO ARE DEALING WITH THIS, TO

03:50:42.862 --> 03:50:44.497
SAY, RAISE THE WAGES. ARE THEY

03:50:44.564 --> 03:50:45.464
WHERE WE WOULD WANT THEM? YEAH,

03:50:45.531 --> 03:50:47.300
MAYBE YES MAYBE NO. COULD THEY

03:50:47.366 --> 03:50:48.734
BE BETTER? MAYBE YES MAYBE NO.

03:50:48.801 --> 03:50:50.903
WE NEED HOUSING. SO WE ASK YOU

03:50:50.970 --> 03:50:52.538

03:51:02.848 --> 03:51:04.684
UP. AND EVENTUALLY THINGS WILL

03:51:04.750 --> 03:51:06.752

OTHER COMMITTEES EARLIER THIS

MORNING AND THAT I HAD TO

03:52:20.593 --> 03:52:22.328
PRESENT BILLS ON, AND LIKE MANY

03:52:22.395 --> 03:52:23.562
OF MY OTHER COLLEAGUES, I WAS

03:52:23.629 --> 03:52:25.998
NOT MADE AWARE OF THIS LANGUAGE

03:52:26.065 --> 03:52:31.003
IN AB 130 UNTIL IT WAS IN PRINT

03:52:31.070 --> 03:52:34.473
LATE YESTERDAY. SO I'M NOT GOING

03:52:35.875 --> 03:52:37.510
OR THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE

03:52:37.576 --> 03:52:39.545
ALREADY MADE BY MY COLLEAGUES.

03:52:39.612 --> 03:52:42.481
AND IN EXPRESSING SERIOUS,

03:52:42.548 --> 03:52:45.685
SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT'S

03:52:45.751 --> 03:52:48.921
BEEN LAID IN THIS TRAILER BILL,

03:52:48.988 --> 03:52:51.490
I WILL MAKE TWO COMMENTS AND

03:52:51.557 --> 03:52:53.693
THEN ASK ONE QUESTION. THE FIRST

03:52:53.759 --> 03:52:55.528
COMMENT IS EARLIER I HEARD A

03:52:55.594 --> 03:52:58.030
WORKER SAY THAT YOU KNOW THIS.

03:52:58.097 --> 03:52:59.699
THIS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WILL

03:52:59.765 --> 03:53:03.069
SET THE CEILING AT $24 AN HOUR.

03:53:03.135 --> 03:53:05.371
IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO SET THE

03:53:05.438 --> 03:53:09.508
CEILING AT $18 AN HOUR. I DON'T

03:53:09.575 --> 03:53:11.577
KNOW A PERSON IN THE STATE OF

03:53:11.644 --> 03:53:13.112
CALIFORNIA WHO CAN PURCHASE A

03:53:13.179 --> 03:53:20.920
HOME WITH $18 AN HOUR. SECONDLY,

03:53:20.986 --> 03:53:23.789
THIS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS

03:53:23.856 --> 03:53:27.126
GOING TO HURT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

03:53:27.193 --> 03:53:30.730
BUILDING THESE HOMES. AS I

03:53:30.796 --> 03:53:36.736
STATED EARLIER, MAKING LESS. IN

03:53:36.802 --> 03:53:38.371
A TIME WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO

03:53:38.437 --> 03:53:40.840
ADDRESS AN AFFORDABILITY CRISIS

03:53:40.906 --> 03:53:43.709
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE BUILDING THE

03:53:43.776 --> 03:53:44.276
HOUSING THAT WE DESPERATELY

03:53:44.343 --> 03:53:51.283
NEED, IS A REAL CONCERN. YOU

03:53:51.350 --> 03:53:53.452
KNOW, AND I'VE BEEN THINKING A

03:53:53.519 --> 03:53:58.491
LOT ABOUT A FORMER GOVERNOR,

03:53:58.557 --> 03:54:02.395
PETE WILSON. ESPECIALLY DURING

03:54:02.461 --> 03:54:04.964
THESE TIMES WHERE WE'RE SEEING

03:54:05.030 --> 03:54:06.999
IMMIGRATION RATES ACROSS THE

03:54:07.066 --> 03:54:09.602
STATE AND THE RHETORIC THAT HE

03:54:09.668 --> 03:54:13.205
USED. BUT I NEVER THOUGHT THAT I

03:54:13.272 --> 03:54:15.040
WOULD BE THINKING ABOUT HIM

03:54:15.107 --> 03:54:17.610
AGAIN THIS YEAR WHEN IT COMES TO

03:54:17.676 --> 03:54:19.578
PREVAILING WAGE, BECAUSE HE WAS

03:54:19.645 --> 03:54:22.248
THE LAST PERSON WHO TRIED TO DO

03:54:22.314 --> 03:54:26.185
SOMETHING LIKE THIS. SO I WANT

03:54:26.252 --> 03:54:28.988
TO ASK THE COMMITTEE OR THE

03:54:29.054 --> 03:54:32.224
CONSULTANTS A QUESTION EARLIER

03:54:32.291 --> 03:54:34.693
IN THE COMMITTEE, AND FORGIVE ME

03:54:34.760 --> 03:54:39.765
IF I GET THIS WRONG. BUT AN AB

03:54:39.832 --> 03:54:42.701
130, THERE'S LANGUAGE IN THERE

03:54:42.768 --> 03:54:44.570
THAT REFERENCES A DIFFERENT

03:54:44.637 --> 03:54:49.175
LABOR CODE THAT SAYS AS SUCH, IT

03:54:49.241 --> 03:54:51.677
HAS NO EFFECT ON WORKERS WHO

03:54:51.744 --> 03:54:53.512
CURRENTLY MAKE THE PREVAILING

03:54:53.579 --> 03:54:56.715
WAGE AND OTHER SECTORS, OR EVEN

03:54:56.782 --> 03:54:58.517
ON PROJECTS WHERE IT IS

03:54:58.584 --> 03:55:02.154
REQUIRED. SO CURRENTLY THAT

03:55:02.221 --> 03:55:04.023
MEANS FOR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

03:55:04.089 --> 03:55:05.391
AGREEMENTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN

03:55:05.458 --> 03:55:08.561
PLACE, THIS WOULD NOT GO

03:55:08.627 --> 03:55:11.764
BACKWARDS OR DO ANYTHING. GO

03:55:11.831 --> 03:55:12.998
LOOKING AT THOSE CURRENTLY. SO

03:55:13.065 --> 03:55:14.366
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE FUTURE

03:55:14.433 --> 03:55:15.801
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

03:55:15.868 --> 03:55:18.103
AGREEMENTS? GENEVIEVE MORALES,

03:55:18.170 --> 03:55:19.171
ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE IT IS

03:55:19.238 --> 03:55:20.873
MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT

03:55:20.940 --> 03:55:24.243
LANGUAGE IN 17 70.1 IS TO

03:55:24.310 --> 03:55:26.278
PROTECT CURRENT AND FUTURE

03:55:26.345 --> 03:55:29.615
FUTURE WORKERS, AND WE WILL GET

03:55:29.682 --> 03:55:31.317
CLARIFICATION TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:55:31.383 --> 03:55:33.219
IS THE CASE. BUT THAT IS MY

03:55:33.285 --> 03:55:34.320
UNDERSTANDING. SO YEAH, I WOULD

03:55:34.386 --> 03:55:35.654
LIKE CLARIFICATION BECAUSE I'M

03:55:35.721 --> 03:55:37.523
REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE

03:55:37.590 --> 03:55:40.726
FUTURE OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

03:55:40.793 --> 03:55:46.465
AGREEMENTS IN THIS STATE. ALL

03:55:46.532 --> 03:55:47.867
RIGHT. WITH THAT. THANK YOU

03:55:47.933 --> 03:55:50.035
EVERYBODY WHO JOINED US FOR THE

03:55:50.102 --> 03:55:51.804
THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATION. AND

03:55:51.871 --> 03:55:53.472
WITH THAT, THIS HEARING IS

03:55:53.539 --> 03:56:08.554
ADJOURNED.
