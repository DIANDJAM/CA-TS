THIS CHOICE WAS MADE IN PART

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:05.229
BECAUSE JUDGES ARE PROHIBITED

00:46:05.295 --> 00:46:06.964
FROM PROVIDING LEGAL ADVICE AND

YEARS, HOWEVER, SOME JUDGES HAVE

00:46:19.977 --> 00:46:22.179
BEEN DEVIATING FROM THE REQUIRED

LANGUAGE IN PENAL CODE SECTION

00:46:24.648 --> 00:46:26.016

00:46:30.721 --> 00:46:32.222
WORDING MISINTERPRETS THE LAW,

00:46:32.289 --> 00:46:33.557
CAUSES CONFUSION, AND MAY

00:46:33.624 --> 00:46:34.925
DISCOURAGE INDIVIDUALS FROM

SECTION TEN 16.5 SINCE ITS

00:46:49.473 --> 00:46:51.775
INCEPTION IN 1977. THE BILL DOES

RETROACTIVELY IN ANY LEGAL

00:47:20.437 --> 00:47:21.438
THAT JUDGES SHOULD PROVIDE THE

00:47:21.505 --> 00:47:23.307
STATUTORY LANGUAGE VERBATIM.

00:47:23.373 --> 00:47:24.741
THIS WILL ENSURE CONSISTENCY

00:47:24.808 --> 00:47:26.577
ACROSS THE STATE AS WHAT IS

00:47:26.643 --> 00:47:28.645
INTENDED BY THE 1977

00:47:28.712 --> 00:47:29.780
LEGISLATURE. TESTIFYING IN

00:47:29.846 --> 00:47:31.582
SUPPORT OF SB 281 TODAY IS

00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:34.484
REPRESENTS THE CALIFORNIA

00:47:34.551 --> 00:47:37.221
ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE.

00:47:37.287 --> 00:47:39.489
THANK YOU. YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES.

00:47:42.125 --> 00:47:43.427
BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA

00:47:43.493 --> 00:47:44.094
ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE,

00:47:44.161 --> 00:47:45.229
STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION OF

00:47:45.295 --> 00:47:46.096
CRIMINAL DEFENSE LAWYERS, WE ARE

00:47:46.163 --> 00:47:49.099
THE SPONSORS OF THIS MEASURE. AS

00:47:49.166 --> 00:47:51.702
THE ASSEMBLYMEMBER MENTIONED, WE

00:47:51.768 --> 00:47:52.803
SPECIFICALLY BROUGHT THIS BILL

00:47:52.869 --> 00:47:54.605
BECAUSE IN RECENT YEARS, JUDGES

00:47:54.671 --> 00:47:57.207
HAVE BEGUN GOING OFF SCRIPT AND

00:47:57.274 --> 00:48:00.043
NOT FOLLOWING THE LANGUAGE OF

00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:01.411
THE ADVISEMENT THAT WAS ADOPTED

00:48:01.478 --> 00:48:03.680
IN 1977. AND LET ME POINT OUT

00:48:03.747 --> 00:48:05.749
THAT THE LANGUAGE OF THE STATUTE

00:48:05.816 --> 00:48:08.252
HAS READ SINCE 1977, QUOTE, THE

00:48:08.318 --> 00:48:09.820
COURT SHALL ADMINISTER THE

00:48:09.886 --> 00:48:11.488
FOLLOWING ADVISEMENT ON THE

00:48:11.555 --> 00:48:13.724
RECORD TO THE DEFENDANT WITH

00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:15.525
COLON, AND THEN IT DESCRIBES

00:48:15.592 --> 00:48:17.628
EXACTLY WHAT SHOULD BE SAID.

00:48:17.694 --> 00:48:18.695
UNFORTUNATELY, WHEN THE JUDGES

00:48:18.762 --> 00:48:20.530
GO OFF SCRIPT, IT HAS CREATED A

00:48:20.597 --> 00:48:23.033
NUMBER OF ISSUES. CONFUSION AS

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:26.370
THE ASSEMBLYMEMBER MENTIONED, AS

00:48:26.436 --> 00:48:27.671
WELL AS SOMETIMES CONFLICT

00:48:27.738 --> 00:48:29.139
BETWEEN WHAT THE JUDGE SAYS AND

00:48:29.206 --> 00:48:30.941
WHAT THE ATTORNEY IS TELLING HIS

00:48:31.008 --> 00:48:34.044
OR HER CLIENT. AND SO THAT

00:48:34.111 --> 00:48:35.646
CONFUSION NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED.

00:48:35.712 --> 00:48:37.147
WE HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS FOR

00:48:37.214 --> 00:48:39.049
QUITE A WHILE, THAT JUDGES NEED

00:48:39.116 --> 00:48:40.717
TO FOLLOW THE LAW BY INSERTING

00:48:40.784 --> 00:48:42.719
ONE WORD INTO STATUTE VERBATIM.

00:48:42.786 --> 00:48:43.920
WE HOPE THAT JUDGES WILL

00:48:43.987 --> 00:48:45.322
ACTUALLY FOLLOW THE LAW. LET ME

00:48:45.389 --> 00:48:46.823
JUST MENTION THAT THE OPPOSITION

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:49.693
WILL BRING UP THAT FOLLOWING THE

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:51.795
LAWS THAT'S BEEN IN 1977 CREATES

00:48:51.862 --> 00:48:54.264
PROBLEMS ON A MOTION TO VACATE.

00:48:54.331 --> 00:48:56.099
OUR BILL DOES NOTHING TO CHANGE

00:48:56.166 --> 00:48:58.035
THE STATUTE ON THE MOTION TO

00:48:58.101 --> 00:49:00.404
VACATE. IN FACT, I WAS INVOLVED

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:01.004
WITH A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS,

00:49:01.071 --> 00:49:02.939
INCLUDING SOME OF THE DA'S, IN

00:49:03.006 --> 00:49:04.741
DRAFTING THAT BILL IN 2015 AND

00:49:04.808 --> 00:49:07.477
ALSO AMENDMENT IN 2018. WE DO

00:49:07.544 --> 00:49:09.112
NOT CHANGE ANYTHING. THE

00:49:09.179 --> 00:49:10.681
CONFUSION IN THOSE MOTIONS TO

00:49:10.747 --> 00:49:13.717
VACATE COMES UP BECAUSE SOME

00:49:13.784 --> 00:49:16.253
D.A.S ARE USING THE MISSTATEMENT

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:17.754
BY JUDGES OF WILL HAVE

00:49:17.821 --> 00:49:19.923
IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES AND

00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:21.892
TRYING TO IMPUTE LEGAL KNOWLEDGE

00:49:21.958 --> 00:49:23.560
THAT IS A REQUIREMENT IN THAT

00:49:23.627 --> 00:49:25.595
MOTION. THAT IS NOT WHAT THE

00:49:25.662 --> 00:49:28.131
INTENT OF THIS STATUTE HAS BEEN

00:49:28.198 --> 00:49:30.400
SINCE 1977. THE DA'S ARE TRYING

00:49:30.467 --> 00:49:32.469
TO, AS I'VE BEEN SAYING, TRYING

00:49:32.536 --> 00:49:34.538
TO TREAT A TRICYCLE LIKE A LIKE

00:49:34.604 --> 00:49:37.541
A ESCALADE. THAT IS NOT THE SAME

00:49:37.607 --> 00:49:38.909
THING. THIS ADVISEMENT WAS

00:49:38.975 --> 00:49:40.510
SUPPOSED TO BE GENERAL

00:49:40.577 --> 00:49:42.212
ADVISEMENT, NOT LEGAL ADVICE,

00:49:42.279 --> 00:49:44.014
NOT CASE SPECIFIC, AND

00:49:44.081 --> 00:49:46.216
DEFINITELY NOT USED AGAINST

00:49:46.283 --> 00:49:47.351
SOMEONE WHO IS FACING

00:49:47.417 --> 00:49:48.719
IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES AND NOW

00:49:48.785 --> 00:49:50.220
WANTS TO WITHDRAW THEIR PLEA

00:49:50.287 --> 00:49:51.355
BECAUSE THEY LEGITIMATELY DID

00:49:51.421 --> 00:49:53.023
NOT KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES.

00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:55.192
BECAUSE PERHAPS THE LAW CHANGED

00:49:55.258 --> 00:49:57.294
AS IT'S CHANGING NOW WEEKLY. SO

00:49:57.361 --> 00:49:59.196
WE JUST WANT TO TREAT THE LAW AS

00:49:59.262 --> 00:50:01.398
IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN. IT'S A

00:50:01.465 --> 00:50:03.667
TRICYCLE. IT'S NOT AN ESCALADE.

00:50:03.734 --> 00:50:05.001
AND FOR THOSE REASONS, WE ASK

00:50:05.068 --> 00:50:08.171

00:50:08.238 --> 00:50:10.941

I AM THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF

MODOC COUNTY. I'M HERE ON BEHALF

00:51:29.753 --> 00:51:30.854
OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT

00:51:30.921 --> 00:51:32.789
ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION. IT IS

00:51:32.856 --> 00:51:35.325
WITH RESPECT THAT WE OPPOSE,

00:51:35.392 --> 00:51:37.427
UNLESS AMENDED, ON THIS BILL,

00:51:37.494 --> 00:51:39.029
THE. ALTHOUGH IT SEEMS INNOCUOUS

00:51:39.095 --> 00:51:41.031
IN THE LANGUAGE, THE EFFECT OF

00:51:41.097 --> 00:51:45.402
IT WOULD BE HUGE IN RESULTING IN

00:51:45.469 --> 00:51:47.838
ADVERSE AND APPEALED DECISIONS

00:51:47.904 --> 00:51:50.006
ON OTHERWISE VALID CONVICTIONS.

00:51:50.073 --> 00:51:51.775
WE STRONGLY SUPPORT WHAT HAS

00:51:51.842 --> 00:51:53.577
BEEN PROPOSED BY THE LOS ANGELES

00:51:53.643 --> 00:51:54.945
DISTRICT ATTORNEY, WHICH WAS

00:51:55.011 --> 00:51:57.948
LANGUAGE THAT WAS SENT TO THE

00:51:58.014 --> 00:51:59.783
CHAIR IN THEIR OPPOSITION

00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:02.319
LETTER, WHICH THEY DID AMEND AND

00:52:02.385 --> 00:52:03.687
PUT IN LANGUAGE THAT WOULD

00:52:03.753 --> 00:52:05.622
ENSURE THE RIGHTS OF THE ACCUSED

00:52:05.689 --> 00:52:07.023
AND THE DEFENDANT AS THEY PLEAD,

00:52:07.090 --> 00:52:08.725
BUT ALSO STRIKE A BALANCE WITH

PUBLIC SAFETY AND UPHOLDING

00:52:12.095 --> 00:52:13.363
CONVICTIONS ON APPEAL. SO WE

WOULD STRONGLY ASK THAT FOR A NO

00:52:15.899 --> 00:52:17.834
VOTE, UNLESS AMENDED TO REFLECT

00:52:17.901 --> 00:52:20.604
THE LANGUAGE HAS PROPOSED BY THE

00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:21.338
LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT

00:52:21.404 --> 00:52:24.474
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. GOOD MORNING,

00:52:24.541 --> 00:52:27.511
CHAIR AND MEMBERS. MY NAME IS

00:52:27.577 --> 00:52:29.279
TAMAR TALCOTT. I'M HERE ON

00:52:29.346 --> 00:52:31.281
BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY

00:52:31.348 --> 00:52:32.182
DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. WE

00:52:32.249 --> 00:52:33.250
ARE RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION

00:52:33.316 --> 00:52:36.019
TO SB 281 UNLESS IT IS AMENDED.

00:52:36.086 --> 00:52:37.554
WE DO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THE

00:52:37.621 --> 00:52:38.989
RECENT AMENDMENT, FOR THE

00:52:39.055 --> 00:52:40.123
CLARIFICATION, FOR THE

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:42.259
RETROACTIVITY ISSUE, BUT THERE

00:52:42.325 --> 00:52:44.461
ARE STILL OTHER SERIOUS CONCERNS

00:52:44.528 --> 00:52:47.464
THAT WE HOPE TO WE HOPE TO

00:52:47.531 --> 00:52:48.732
ADDRESS IN LOS ANGELES. IN THE

00:52:48.798 --> 00:52:50.500
LAST FEW YEARS ALONE, WE HAVE

00:52:50.567 --> 00:52:52.702
HAD SEVERAL CASES WHERE VALID

00:52:52.769 --> 00:52:54.170
CONVICTIONS WERE REVERSED, YEARS

00:52:54.237 --> 00:52:55.639
AFTER THE DEFENDANT HAD ALREADY

00:52:55.705 --> 00:52:57.340
PLED GUILTY, BECAUSE YEARS LATER

00:52:57.407 --> 00:52:59.109
HE MADE A MOTION TO WITHDRAW HIS

00:52:59.175 --> 00:53:00.110
PLEA, CLAIMING THAT WHEN THE

00:53:00.176 --> 00:53:02.512
COURT HAD TOLD HIM THAT HE MAY

00:53:02.579 --> 00:53:04.014
FACE IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES,

00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:04.581
HE DIDN'T THINK THAT WOULD

00:53:04.648 --> 00:53:07.384
ACTUALLY APPLY TO HIM OR HAPPEN

00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:08.218
TO HIM. AND SOME OF THESE CASES

00:53:08.285 --> 00:53:10.353
INCLUDE SEXUAL ASSAULT, CHILD

00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:12.389
MOLESTATION, EVEN MURDER. WHEN

00:53:12.455 --> 00:53:13.590
DEFENDANTS ARE ALLOWED TO

00:53:13.657 --> 00:53:15.659
WITHDRAW THEIR PLEA. IN THESE

00:53:15.725 --> 00:53:17.460
CASES, THERE ARE SERIOUS

00:53:17.527 --> 00:53:18.862
CONSEQUENCES FOR THE VICTIMS AND

00:53:18.929 --> 00:53:21.431
SURVIVING FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE

00:53:21.498 --> 00:53:22.365
RETRAUMATIZED WHEN THEY THOUGHT

00:53:22.432 --> 00:53:24.801
THEY HAD CLOSURE YEARS AGO.

00:53:24.868 --> 00:53:26.269
THAT'S ASSUMING WE CAN EVEN TAKE

00:53:26.336 --> 00:53:28.305
THE CASE TO TRIAL. IF WE CAN'T

00:53:28.371 --> 00:53:30.206
TAKE THE CASE TO TRIAL, BECAUSE

00:53:30.273 --> 00:53:31.575
YEARS HAVE PASSED AND NOW WE'RE

00:53:31.641 --> 00:53:33.310
MISSING WITNESSES OR OTHER

00:53:33.376 --> 00:53:34.377
EVIDENCE. THAT MEANS THAT

00:53:34.444 --> 00:53:35.812
SOMEONE WHO COMMITTED A HEINOUS

00:53:35.879 --> 00:53:37.681
CRIME WILL HAVE NO CONVICTION.

00:53:37.747 --> 00:53:39.115
THAT REFLECTS WHAT THEY DID, AND

00:53:39.182 --> 00:53:41.585
NO CONSEQUENCES THAT FLOW

00:53:41.651 --> 00:53:42.719
THEREAFTER. THAT MEANS, FOR

00:53:42.786 --> 00:53:43.787
EXAMPLE, THAT SOMEONE WHO

00:53:43.853 --> 00:53:45.622
OTHERWISE SHOULDN'T HAVE GUNS

00:53:45.689 --> 00:53:48.091
CAN NOW HAVE THE RIGHT TO OWN

00:53:48.158 --> 00:53:50.226
GUNS. OR IF THEIR CRIME WAS

00:53:50.293 --> 00:53:52.062
SOMETHING LIKE A RAPE, THEY

00:53:52.128 --> 00:53:53.797
WON'T HAVE TO REGISTER AS A SEX

00:53:53.863 --> 00:53:54.998
OFFENDER. THERE ARE PUBLISHED

00:53:55.065 --> 00:53:56.399
CALIFORNIA APPELLATE AND SUPREME

00:53:56.466 --> 00:53:58.234
COURT CASES, WHERE COURTS HAVE

00:53:58.301 --> 00:53:59.736
FOUND THAT ADVISING DEFENDANTS

00:53:59.803 --> 00:54:01.037
THAT THEIR PLEA MAY HAVE

00:54:01.104 --> 00:54:03.740
IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES WAS

00:54:03.807 --> 00:54:05.241
SUFFICIENT, PARTICULARLY IN

00:54:05.308 --> 00:54:06.309
CASES WHERE THE DEFENDANT

00:54:06.376 --> 00:54:08.144
COMMITTED A CRIME CONSIDERED

00:54:08.211 --> 00:54:09.713
DEPORTABLE UNDER FEDERAL

00:54:09.779 --> 00:54:11.414
IMMIGRATION LAWS. SO WHEN COURTS

00:54:11.481 --> 00:54:13.516
OR DA'S TAKING THE PLEA ADVISE

00:54:13.583 --> 00:54:15.318
DEFENDANTS THAT THERE WILL BE

00:54:15.385 --> 00:54:16.953
CONSEQUENCES, IT'S NOT DONE TO

00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:18.254
GIVE IMMIGRATION ADVICE. IT'S

00:54:18.321 --> 00:54:20.056
NOT JUST DONE HAPHAZARDLY OR

00:54:20.123 --> 00:54:21.091
WILLFULLY. IN FACT, EVEN THE

00:54:21.157 --> 00:54:23.627
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS REFERS TO

00:54:23.693 --> 00:54:25.095
SOME CASES, APPELLATE COURT

00:54:25.161 --> 00:54:26.496
CASES THAT SAID THAT THE COURT

00:54:26.563 --> 00:54:28.298
SHOULD HAVE SAID THIS WILL

00:54:28.365 --> 00:54:29.766
HAPPEN, NOT THAT THIS MAY

00:54:29.833 --> 00:54:31.935
HAPPEN. SO THIS IS AS A RESULT

00:54:32.002 --> 00:54:34.104
OF THE APPELLATE CASES THAT HAVE

00:54:34.170 --> 00:54:36.139
COME DOWN. AND THAT'S BECAUSE

00:54:36.206 --> 00:54:38.008
THE EXISTING STATUTE, EVEN

00:54:38.074 --> 00:54:40.310
THOUGH IT'S BEEN ON THE BOOKS

00:54:40.377 --> 00:54:40.910
FOR MANY YEARS, IT WAS NEVER

00:54:40.977 --> 00:54:42.912
VERBATIM AND IT'S BEEN DEEMED,

00:54:42.979 --> 00:54:45.248
YOU KNOW, AN INADEQUATE

00:54:45.315 --> 00:54:46.683
ADVISEMENT OVER THE YEARS. SO

00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:48.818
WHAT PUBLIC SAFETY GOAL WOULD BE

00:54:48.885 --> 00:54:50.654
SERVED BY MANDATING THAT IT NOW

00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:53.823
BE RECITED VERBATIM? WE

00:54:53.890 --> 00:54:55.191
ABSOLUTELY SHARE THE AUTHORS

00:54:55.258 --> 00:54:57.527
GOAL OF ENSURING THAT DEFENDANTS

00:54:57.594 --> 00:54:58.528
UNDERSTAND ALL OF THEIR RIGHTS

00:54:58.595 --> 00:55:00.363
AND CONSEQUENCES WHEN ENTERING A

00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:01.965
PLEA. WE'RE NOT TRYING TO KILL

00:55:02.032 --> 00:55:03.933
THIS BILL. WE'RE JUST TRYING TO

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.735
HELP FIX IT BY STRENGTHENING THE

00:55:05.802 --> 00:55:06.903
EXISTING ADVISEMENT, IF IT IS TO

00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:08.938
BE GIVEN VERBATIM. SO TO THAT

00:55:09.005 --> 00:55:11.207
END, WE HAVE PROVIDED THE

00:55:11.274 --> 00:55:12.175
COMMITTEE AND THE AUTHOR WITH

00:55:12.242 --> 00:55:13.677
OUR PROPOSED AMENDMENTS, WHICH

00:55:13.743 --> 00:55:15.512
ARE INTENDED TO ADDRESS BOTH THE

00:55:15.578 --> 00:55:17.814
AUTHOR'S CONCERNS AND OURS, AND

00:55:17.881 --> 00:55:19.049
WE THANK EVERYBODY FOR THEIR

00:55:19.115 --> 00:55:22.085
CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU. DO WE

00:55:22.152 --> 00:55:24.187
HAVE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE

00:55:24.254 --> 00:55:27.090
TO LINE UP AND PROVIDE? PLEASE

00:55:27.157 --> 00:55:28.892
STATE YOUR NAME AND YOUR

00:55:28.958 --> 00:55:29.993
ORGANIZATION. HI, MY NAME IS

00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:32.062
DAVID BULLOCK. I'M SPEAKING ON

00:55:32.128 --> 00:55:32.595
BEHALF OF A COALITION OF

00:55:32.662 --> 00:55:33.663
COMMUNITY, WOMEN'S RIGHTS,

00:55:33.730 --> 00:55:34.698
MENTAL HEALTH, RELIGIOUS AND

00:55:34.764 --> 00:55:36.466
LEGAL SUPPORT GROUPS. WHILE WE

00:55:36.533 --> 00:55:37.801
APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THE

00:55:37.867 --> 00:55:39.736
BILL AND WE THINK IT'S GREAT, WE

00:55:39.803 --> 00:55:41.705
DO HAVE OBJECTIONS TO REPLACING

00:55:41.771 --> 00:55:42.939
HIS OR HER WITH THEIRS. WE FEEL

00:55:43.006 --> 00:55:45.542
THAT IS THE FURTHER OF DENYING

00:55:45.608 --> 00:55:47.510
SEX BASED WOMEN'S RIGHTS IN

00:55:47.577 --> 00:55:48.611
CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU, THANK

00:55:48.678 --> 00:55:51.915
YOU. ALL RIGHT. I'M GOING TO

00:55:51.981 --> 00:55:54.050
TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES.

00:55:54.117 --> 00:55:56.586
DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS? YES.

00:55:56.653 --> 00:55:59.055
BECKY. YEAH. I DON'T HAVE ANY

00:55:59.122 --> 00:56:00.557
REAL QUESTIONS. I JUST WANT TO

00:56:00.623 --> 00:56:03.660
CLARIFY MY POSITION THAT I

00:56:03.727 --> 00:56:04.994
UNDERSTAND THE INTENT BEHIND

00:56:05.061 --> 00:56:06.262
THIS. AND IT'S SOMEWHAT NOBLE.

00:56:06.329 --> 00:56:08.798
BUT THERE THE OPPOSITION HAS

00:56:08.865 --> 00:56:11.201
EXPRESSED MY POSITION THAT IT'S

00:56:11.267 --> 00:56:13.069
IF YOU TOOK THE AMENDMENTS AS

00:56:13.136 --> 00:56:17.807
PROPOSED BY THE LA PROSECUTOR.

00:56:17.874 --> 00:56:19.843
IT'S SUPPORTABLE. BUT RETRO

00:56:19.909 --> 00:56:20.677
RETROACTIVITY WOULD BE

00:56:20.744 --> 00:56:22.479
COMPLETELY UNREASONABLE AND

00:56:22.545 --> 00:56:25.014
WOULD CAUSE ABSOLUTE CHAOS. AND

00:56:25.081 --> 00:56:28.585
I'VE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE AUTHOR

00:56:28.651 --> 00:56:32.555
HAS DIFFICULTY CHANGING THAT,

00:56:32.622 --> 00:56:33.923
THAT IT WAS PROPOSED IN THE

00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:35.892
SENATE SIDE AND THERE WAS SOME

00:56:35.959 --> 00:56:36.993
STRONG RESERVATIONS. BUT WE'LL

00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:40.063
SEE. I YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE IN

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:42.632
TRUST, BUT VERIFY IS REALLY

00:56:42.699 --> 00:56:44.067
IMPORTANT. SO IF IT'S IN THE

00:56:44.134 --> 00:56:46.402
BILL AND IT'S AMENDED, THERE

00:56:46.469 --> 00:56:48.138
WOULD BE SOME TEMPTATION TO

00:56:48.204 --> 00:56:51.241
SUPPORT THIS THING. BUT THE

00:56:51.307 --> 00:56:52.742
OPPOSITION IS ALSO INDICATED TO

00:56:52.809 --> 00:56:56.346
THAT THE TERM MAY IS A BIT

00:56:56.412 --> 00:56:58.982
PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE IT'S TOO

00:56:59.048 --> 00:57:00.717
SUBJECTIVE AND IT'S EASILY

00:57:00.784 --> 00:57:01.484
MISUNDERSTOOD. SO I THINK

00:57:01.551 --> 00:57:02.886
THERE'S SOME PROBLEMS THERE AS

00:57:02.952 --> 00:57:05.755
WELL. SO IN ITS CURRENT FORM I'M

00:57:05.822 --> 00:57:07.290
NOT ABLE TO SUPPORT IT. THANK

00:57:07.357 --> 00:57:09.626
YOU, ASSEMBLY MEMBER NGUYEN.

00:57:09.692 --> 00:57:12.162
THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR. JUST A

00:57:12.228 --> 00:57:13.596
COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. SHE HAD

00:57:13.663 --> 00:57:14.330
INDICATED A COUPLE OF THINGS

00:57:14.397 --> 00:57:15.999
ABOUT SOME OF THESE HEINOUS

00:57:16.065 --> 00:57:17.767
CRIMES. AND I'M WONDERING, SINCE

00:57:17.834 --> 00:57:19.202
YOU'VE WORKED ON THIS FOR SUCH A

00:57:19.269 --> 00:57:20.904
LONG TIME, IF YOU CAN SPEAK TO

00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:22.305
SOME OF THAT AND ANSWER SOME,

00:57:22.372 --> 00:57:24.107
AND YOU MAY DO THAT IN YOUR

00:57:24.174 --> 00:57:25.842
CLOSING, I JUST WASN'T SURE IF

00:57:25.909 --> 00:57:27.110
YOU WERE GOING TO ADDRESS SOME

00:57:27.177 --> 00:57:28.444
OF THE ISSUES THAT THEY BROUGHT

00:57:28.511 --> 00:57:31.114
UP. YEAH, I'LL JUST THANK YOU

00:57:31.181 --> 00:57:32.081
VERY MUCH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:57:32.148 --> 00:57:33.650
NGUYEN, I HAVE JUST A BRIEF

00:57:33.716 --> 00:57:34.984
RESPONSE, AND I'M GOING TO TURN

00:57:35.051 --> 00:57:37.053
IT OVER TO OUR TECHNICAL EXPERT

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:39.289
FROM MY YEARS IN PRACTICE.

00:57:39.355 --> 00:57:40.123
OBVIOUSLY, IT'S A BIG DEAL WHEN

00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:41.624
SOMEONE ATTEMPTS TO WITHDRAW A

00:57:41.691 --> 00:57:43.459
PLEA. THERE ARE VERY SERIOUS

00:57:43.526 --> 00:57:44.894
PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS, AND I

00:57:44.961 --> 00:57:46.596
SHARE WHAT WAS ECHOED BY THE

00:57:46.663 --> 00:57:47.330
OPPOSITION WITNESSES. WHAT I

00:57:47.397 --> 00:57:49.532
WOULD SAY, THOUGH, IS IT'S NOT

00:57:49.599 --> 00:57:50.667
NECESSARILY EASY TO WITHDRAW A

00:57:50.733 --> 00:57:52.202
PLEA. YOU DO HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE

00:57:52.268 --> 00:57:53.603
THAT THERE WAS PREJUDICE TO YOUR

00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:56.105
CASE. SO IF THE COURT DIDN'T SAY

00:57:56.172 --> 00:57:57.540
SOMETHING EXACTLY THE WAY THAT

00:57:57.607 --> 00:57:58.174
YOU THAT YOU THOUGHT IT SHOULD

00:57:58.241 --> 00:58:00.243
HAVE BEEN SAID, THAT DOESN'T

00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:01.211
MEAN BY DEFAULT YOU GET TO

00:58:01.277 --> 00:58:03.279
WITHDRAW YOUR PLEA. THE COURT

00:58:03.346 --> 00:58:03.947
HAS TO MAKE THAT ASSESSMENT OF

00:58:04.013 --> 00:58:05.415
WAS THERE PREJUDICE ESSENTIALLY,

00:58:05.481 --> 00:58:07.217
DID YOU NOT UNDERSTAND WITH FULL

00:58:07.283 --> 00:58:09.085
EXTENT AND SCOPE THE WEIGHT OF

00:58:09.152 --> 00:58:10.386
THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE PLEA?

00:58:10.453 --> 00:58:12.288
YOU WERE ABOUT TO ENTER ALL THE

00:58:12.355 --> 00:58:13.323
POTENTIAL ATTENDANT

00:58:13.389 --> 00:58:14.090
CONSEQUENCES? I'VE SEEN MANY

00:58:14.157 --> 00:58:15.458
TIMES WHERE EVEN THOUGH THAT

00:58:15.525 --> 00:58:16.359
CONCERN HAS BEEN RAISED, THE

00:58:16.426 --> 00:58:18.361
COURT HAS FOUND THAT THERE WAS

00:58:18.428 --> 00:58:20.363
NO PREJUDICE AND NOT ALLOWED THE

00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:21.030
PLEA TO BE WITHDRAWN. I'VE ALSO

00:58:21.097 --> 00:58:22.966
SEEN IT GO THE OTHER WAY. WITH

00:58:23.032 --> 00:58:24.267
THAT SAID, I'D LIKE TO TURN IT

00:58:24.334 --> 00:58:25.969
OVER TO OUR TECHNICAL EXPERT. TO

00:58:26.035 --> 00:58:27.437
MORE SPECIFICALLY ANSWER YOUR

00:58:27.503 --> 00:58:28.271
QUESTION. I WILL JUST MENTION,

00:58:28.338 --> 00:58:29.906
THOUGH, MR. LACKEY, I HAVE

00:58:29.973 --> 00:58:31.641
SPOKEN DIRECTLY WITH THE AUTHOR.

00:58:31.708 --> 00:58:32.242
I TOO SHARED THE CONCERN OF

00:58:32.308 --> 00:58:33.343
RETROACTIVITY. I HAVE GOTTEN

00:58:33.409 --> 00:58:34.043
THAT CONCESSION AND THAT

00:58:34.110 --> 00:58:36.045
COMMITMENT FROM SENATOR PEREZ TO

00:58:36.112 --> 00:58:37.480
BAKE THIS IN THE BILL. AND BASED

00:58:37.547 --> 00:58:39.082
ON ALL OF MY YEARS OF WORKING

00:58:39.148 --> 00:58:41.017
WITH HER, I KNOW SHE'S A PERSON

00:58:41.084 --> 00:58:43.519
OF HER WORD. SO I HAVE NO

00:58:43.586 --> 00:58:44.520
RESERVATIONS THERE. BUT I DID

00:58:44.587 --> 00:58:45.622
WANT TO MAKE IT EXTRAORDINARILY

00:58:45.688 --> 00:58:46.689
CLEAR SHE HAS AGREED TO CLARIFY

00:58:46.756 --> 00:58:48.992
THE BILL, THAT IT WILL NOT BE

00:58:49.058 --> 00:58:51.694
RETROACTIVE. YEAH. THANK YOU.

00:58:51.761 --> 00:58:54.030
JUST ONE ADDENDUM TO THE

00:58:54.097 --> 00:58:55.031
RETROACTIVITY. I'VE ACTUALLY

00:58:55.098 --> 00:58:56.299
DRAFTED LANGUAGE. I'VE GONE BACK

00:58:56.366 --> 00:58:58.101
AND FORTH WITH THE COMMITTEE AND

00:58:58.167 --> 00:58:59.903
SHARED IT WITH A COUPLE OF

00:58:59.969 --> 00:59:01.571
OFFICES. SO THE COMMITMENT IS

00:59:01.638 --> 00:59:02.205
THERE. WE JUST HAVE TO FINALIZE

00:59:02.272 --> 00:59:04.374
THE LANGUAGE. SOME MEMBER THANK

00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:05.275
YOU FOR BRINGING THAT UP. AS FAR

00:59:05.341 --> 00:59:07.176
AS HOW THE ADVISEMENT APPLIES,

00:59:07.243 --> 00:59:09.445
WHEN IT WAS ADOPTED IN 1977, THE

00:59:09.512 --> 00:59:11.314
STATUTE SAYS VERY SPECIFICALLY,

00:59:11.381 --> 00:59:14.317
THIS ADVISEMENT IS GIVEN TO

00:59:14.384 --> 00:59:15.618
EVERY CASE THAT IS NOT AN

00:59:15.685 --> 00:59:17.387
INFRACTION. SO MISDEMEANORS AND

00:59:17.453 --> 00:59:18.855
FELONIES. SO THE MOST SERIOUS

00:59:18.922 --> 00:59:20.690
FELONIES TO THE LOWEST LEVEL

00:59:20.757 --> 00:59:22.492
MISDEMEANORS ALL RECEIVE THIS

00:59:22.558 --> 00:59:24.327
ADVISEMENT. YOUR QUESTION AS TO

00:59:24.394 --> 00:59:27.130
I THINK THE MOTION TO VACATE A

00:59:27.196 --> 00:59:31.067
PLEA AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:59:31.134 --> 00:59:32.135
MENTIONED, THERE IS A PRETTY

00:59:32.201 --> 00:59:35.305
RIGOROUS PROCESS TO FILE A

00:59:35.371 --> 00:59:37.006
MOTION AND TO GET IT. GRANTED,

00:59:37.073 --> 00:59:38.608
THERE HAS TO BE PREJUDICE, THE

00:59:38.675 --> 00:59:39.842
STANDARDS ACTUALLY THE TOTALITY

00:59:39.909 --> 00:59:41.611
OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES. SO

00:59:41.678 --> 00:59:43.613
EVERYTHING IS LOOKED AT VERY

00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:45.815
CAREFULLY. I WOULD SAY THAT IN

00:59:45.882 --> 00:59:47.383
CASES INVOLVING MURDER, FOR

00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:49.819
EXAMPLE, AS WAS BROUGHT UP, I'VE

00:59:49.886 --> 00:59:51.688
SEEN CASE LAW THAT SAYS WHEN

00:59:51.754 --> 00:59:53.389
IT'S MURDER, PEOPLE ARE PRETTY

00:59:53.456 --> 00:59:54.190
MUCH UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S

00:59:54.257 --> 00:59:56.025
GOING TO BE ADVERSE IMMIGRATION

00:59:56.092 --> 00:59:57.460
CONSEQUENCES BECAUSE IT IS THE

00:59:57.527 --> 00:59:59.128
MOST SEVERE. SO I'VE SEEN THOSE

00:59:59.195 --> 01:00:00.596
MOTIONS DENIED ON THAT BASIS. SO

01:00:00.663 --> 01:00:03.900
THE MOST MORE SERIOUS THE

01:00:03.967 --> 01:00:05.301
OFFENSE, THE WHAT I HAVE SEEN

01:00:05.368 --> 01:00:07.904
AGAIN, THIS IS DON'T TAKE IT FOR

01:00:07.971 --> 01:00:09.906
EXPERT OPINION, BUT JUST FOR MY

01:00:09.973 --> 01:00:11.407
EXPERIENCE, I'VE SEEN THAT THE

01:00:11.474 --> 01:00:12.408
MORE SERIOUS THE OFFENSE, THE

01:00:12.475 --> 01:00:13.843
MORE DIFFICULT IT IS TO WITHDRAW

01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:15.345
THAT PLEA. I ALSO WANT TO POINT

01:00:15.411 --> 01:00:17.213
OUT, AS THE OPPOSITION POINTED,

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.281
THAT THESE CASES ARE NOT

01:00:18.348 --> 01:00:19.315
OVERTURNED, THE CONVICTIONS ARE

01:00:19.382 --> 01:00:20.383
NOT OVERTURNED, THE PLEA

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:21.784
AGREEMENTS ARE WITHDRAWN, AND

01:00:21.851 --> 01:00:22.986
THEN THEY EITHER HAVE TO GO TO

01:00:23.052 --> 01:00:24.954
TRIAL OR THEY HAVE TO ENTER INTO

01:00:25.021 --> 01:00:27.623
A PLEA OF GUILTY OR NO CONTEST

01:00:27.690 --> 01:00:28.624
TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE DA'S. SO

01:00:28.691 --> 01:00:29.859
THOSE CASES ARE NOT DISMISSED. I

01:00:29.926 --> 01:00:32.061
JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR.

01:00:32.128 --> 01:00:33.229
AND AGAIN, IF THERE'S DISCUSSION

01:00:33.296 --> 01:00:34.864
ON THE MOTION TO VACATE IS NOT,

01:00:34.931 --> 01:00:36.332
YOU KNOW, NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED

01:00:36.399 --> 01:00:38.134
OR CHANGED, WE'RE HAPPY TO

01:00:38.201 --> 01:00:40.236
ENGAGE. WE WERE PART OF THE A

01:00:40.303 --> 01:00:41.004
GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS THAT

01:00:41.070 --> 01:00:42.672
DRAFTED THAT, INCLUDING DAS. AND

01:00:42.739 --> 01:00:43.806
WE'D HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. BUT

01:00:43.873 --> 01:00:46.342
THIS BILL IS JUST TRYING TO STAY

01:00:46.409 --> 01:00:47.543
CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WAS DRAFTED

01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:49.579
IN 1977. I ACTUALLY PULLED THE

01:00:49.645 --> 01:00:52.115
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS FROM 1977 TO

01:00:52.181 --> 01:00:54.017
MAKE SURE WHEN I SAY THAT WAS

01:00:54.083 --> 01:00:56.052
THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE BILL,

01:00:56.119 --> 01:00:57.687
IT WAS IN FACT, I BEEN WORKING

01:00:57.754 --> 01:00:58.321
ON LEGISLATION HERE FOR A LONG

01:00:58.388 --> 01:01:00.223
TIME. I WASN'T HERE IN 1977, BUT

01:01:00.289 --> 01:01:02.125
I DID WANT TO CONFIRM. AND

01:01:02.191 --> 01:01:03.026
THAT'S WHY WE DRAFTED THE BILL

01:01:03.092 --> 01:01:05.128
VERY NARROWLY, AND WE DID NOT

01:01:05.194 --> 01:01:07.030
WANT TO PUT OUR FINGER ON THE

01:01:07.096 --> 01:01:07.997
SCALE FOR THOSE MOTIONS TO

01:01:08.064 --> 01:01:09.766
VACATE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. WE

01:01:09.832 --> 01:01:10.867
WERE VERY CAREFUL IN DRAFTING

01:01:10.933 --> 01:01:13.403
THE BILL THAT WAY. SO THANK YOU

01:01:13.469 --> 01:01:14.404
FOR THE QUESTION. THANK YOU. AND

01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:16.139
IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S STILL

01:01:16.205 --> 01:01:16.806
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CHAIR AND

01:01:16.873 --> 01:01:18.341
SOME SOME WORK THROUGH THAT

01:01:18.408 --> 01:01:21.477
NEEDS TO GET DONE. POSSIBLY

01:01:21.544 --> 01:01:22.045
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. AND I WOULD

01:01:22.111 --> 01:01:23.813
JUST LIKE TO TAKE THIS

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:24.947
OPPORTUNITY TO THANK THE LOS

01:01:25.014 --> 01:01:25.748
ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT

01:01:25.815 --> 01:01:27.050
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. A LOT OF

01:01:27.116 --> 01:01:28.618
TIMES WE GET OPPOSITION AND WE

01:01:28.684 --> 01:01:29.919
DON'T HAVE A LOT OF FRUITFUL

01:01:29.986 --> 01:01:31.454
IDEAS TO SORT OF MEET FOLKS IN

01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:33.489
THE MIDDLE. I REALLY APPRECIATE

01:01:33.556 --> 01:01:34.624
THAT THIS OFFICE CAME UP WITH

01:01:34.690 --> 01:01:36.392
SOME LANGUAGE THAT THEY FELT

01:01:36.459 --> 01:01:37.760
TRIES TO STRIKE THE BALANCE. I

01:01:37.827 --> 01:01:38.861
LOOKED AT IT AND, YOU KNOW, I

01:01:38.928 --> 01:01:40.663
PRACTICED IN TWO STATES. NOW,

01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:41.564
USING MY OWN EXPERIENCE. I

01:01:41.631 --> 01:01:42.799
DIDN'T FIND THE LANGUAGE TO BE

01:01:42.865 --> 01:01:44.000
THAT RIGHT BALANCE. THAT WAS

01:01:44.067 --> 01:01:45.868
JUST MY PERSONAL TAKE. BUT THIS

01:01:45.935 --> 01:01:47.136
IS REALLY A DECISION THAT THE

01:01:47.203 --> 01:01:49.472
AUTHOR AND THE L.A. COUNTY DA'S

01:01:49.539 --> 01:01:50.106
OFFICE WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE

01:01:50.173 --> 01:01:51.541
IN. I THINK THAT THERE IS

01:01:51.607 --> 01:01:52.308
DEFINITELY ROOM THAT THEY CAN

01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:54.143
MEET IN THE MIDDLE AND FINE TUNE

01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:56.546
THIS LANGUAGE. I THINK WE CAN

01:01:56.612 --> 01:01:57.313
ALL AGREE THAT IT CAN BE

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:58.181
BOLSTERED, IT CAN BE

01:01:58.247 --> 01:02:00.283
STRENGTHENED. AND I WANT TO JUST

01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:00.883
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY TOOK THE

01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:03.219
TIME TO AT LEAST COME UP WITH

01:02:03.286 --> 01:02:04.487
SOME ALTERNATIVE. AND I REALLY

01:02:04.554 --> 01:02:05.888
HOPE THAT SENATOR PEREZ AND I

01:02:05.955 --> 01:02:07.356
BELIEVE THAT SHE WILL SERIOUSLY

01:02:07.423 --> 01:02:08.357
LOOK AT THAT PROPOSAL. AND

01:02:08.424 --> 01:02:10.760
PERHAPS THE TWO CAN MEET IN THE

01:02:10.827 --> 01:02:11.427
MIDDLE BY THE END OF THIS THING.

01:02:11.494 --> 01:02:13.262
OKAY. PERFECT. THANK YOU. SURE.

01:02:13.329 --> 01:02:14.163
THANK YOU. JUST VERY BRIEFLY.

01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:15.431
YEAH, WE LOOKED AT THAT LANGUAGE

01:02:15.498 --> 01:02:17.800
AS WELL. AND, YOU KNOW, THERE'S

01:02:17.867 --> 01:02:19.202
TWO THINGS. ONE IS WHEN WE

01:02:19.268 --> 01:02:21.437
INTRODUCED THE BILL, WE DID NOT

01:02:21.504 --> 01:02:22.338
WANT TO CHANGE ANY LANGUAGE IN

01:02:22.405 --> 01:02:23.873
THE ADVISEMENT BECAUSE WE DIDN'T

01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:25.875
WANT TO DISRUPT. AND KIND OF AS

01:02:25.942 --> 01:02:27.243
SOMEONE HAS SAID, OPEN THE

01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:28.377
PANDORA'S BOX ON THAT. SO THAT'S

01:02:28.444 --> 01:02:29.879
WHY WE KEPT IT VERBATIM, WHICH

01:02:29.946 --> 01:02:31.814
WE ACTUALLY THINK THE STATUTE

01:02:31.881 --> 01:02:32.882
ALREADY MEANS VERBATIM. SO

01:02:32.949 --> 01:02:33.883
THAT'S WHY WE DID IT VERY

01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:34.450
NARROWLY. IN REVIEWING THE

01:02:34.517 --> 01:02:36.052
LANGUAGE OF THE LÀ, THERE ARE

01:02:36.119 --> 01:02:37.420
PORTIONS OF IT THAT FRANKLY,

01:02:37.487 --> 01:02:39.188
MAKE SENSE. I DON'T KNOW IF WE

01:02:39.255 --> 01:02:40.957
WOULD AGREE TO PUT IT IN THE

01:02:41.023 --> 01:02:42.291
BILL, BECAUSE WE HAVE TO LOOK AT

01:02:42.358 --> 01:02:44.460
WHAT THE LEGAL CONSEQUENCES ARE,

01:02:44.527 --> 01:02:45.761
BUT PART OF IT DOES MAKE SENSE.

01:02:45.828 --> 01:02:47.029
THE PORTION OF IT THAT WE HAVE

01:02:47.096 --> 01:02:49.699
PROBLEMS WITH IS WHEN IT SAYS

01:02:49.765 --> 01:02:50.333
THAT YOU MUST ASSUME THAT YOU

01:02:50.399 --> 01:02:51.901
WILL BE DEPORTED, THAT THEN

01:02:51.968 --> 01:02:52.702
IMPUTES LEGAL KNOWLEDGE, WHICH

01:02:52.768 --> 01:02:54.370
IS A REQUIREMENT IN THE MOTION

01:02:54.437 --> 01:02:56.139
TO VACATE. WE DO NOT WANT TO PUT

01:02:56.205 --> 01:02:57.840
OUR FINGER ON THE SCALE OF

01:02:57.907 --> 01:02:58.975
MOTION TO VACATE, LET ALONE A

01:02:59.041 --> 01:03:01.110
HAND ON THAT. THAT IS THE

01:03:01.177 --> 01:03:02.011
PORTION OF THE SUGGESTION THAT

01:03:02.078 --> 01:03:03.312
COMPLETELY CHANGES IT IN WHAT I

01:03:03.379 --> 01:03:04.914
WAS SAYING, CHANGES IT FROM A

01:03:04.981 --> 01:03:06.482
TRICYCLE TO AN ESCALADE. THAT IS

01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:08.684
A VERY DIFFERENT BILL AND VERY

01:03:08.751 --> 01:03:09.285
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT, 1977? SO

01:03:09.352 --> 01:03:10.887
THAT PORTION OF IT IS THE ONE

01:03:10.953 --> 01:03:13.756
THAT WE HAVE THE MOST PROBLEMS

01:03:13.823 --> 01:03:14.390
WITH. BUT OTHERWISE WE'RE OPEN

01:03:14.457 --> 01:03:15.358
TO THAT DISCUSSION AND HAVE GOOD

01:03:15.424 --> 01:03:18.928
FAITH DISCUSSIONS GOING FORWARD.

01:03:18.995 --> 01:03:20.296
ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR

01:03:20.363 --> 01:03:23.566
COMMENTS? OKAY. SEEING NONE,

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:25.635
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE? YES,

01:03:25.701 --> 01:03:27.703
VERY BRIEFLY, MADAM CHAIR. JUST

01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:29.739
WANT TO THANK NOT ONLY THE

01:03:29.805 --> 01:03:30.907
SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL, BUT I

01:03:30.973 --> 01:03:33.075
WANT TO THANK THE OPPOSITION FOR

01:03:33.142 --> 01:03:34.010
ENGAGING. I KNOW THAT SENATOR

01:03:34.076 --> 01:03:35.444
PEREZ IS A THOUGHTFUL AND

01:03:35.511 --> 01:03:36.279
COLLABORATIVE LEADER, AND I HAVE

01:03:36.345 --> 01:03:37.747
FULL EXPECTATION THAT SHE'LL

01:03:37.813 --> 01:03:39.048
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU TO

01:03:39.115 --> 01:03:41.317
MAKE THIS A MORE PERFECT BILL. I

01:03:41.384 --> 01:03:43.386
WILL BE HUMBLY ASKING FOR AN AYE

01:03:43.452 --> 01:03:44.453
VOTE ON BEHALF OF SENATOR PEREZ,

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:46.522
AND I JUST WANTED TO CLOSE WITH

01:03:46.589 --> 01:03:47.790
SAYING THAT WHAT SHE IS

01:03:47.857 --> 01:03:49.525
ATTEMPTING TO DO IN REQUIRING A

01:03:49.592 --> 01:03:50.760
VERBATIM ADVISEMENT UNDER THE

01:03:50.826 --> 01:03:52.828
LAW IS NOT NECESSARILY NOVEL OR

01:03:52.895 --> 01:03:54.063
UNIQUE. I WOULD JUST GIVE YOU

01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:55.631
TWO QUICK EXAMPLES. UNDER

01:03:55.698 --> 01:03:58.167
VEHICLE CODE SECTION 250 593,

01:03:58.234 --> 01:03:59.635
JUDGES ARE ALREADY REQUIRED TO

01:03:59.702 --> 01:04:01.037
PROVIDE A VERBATIM ADVISEMENT

01:04:01.103 --> 01:04:02.471
REGARDING THE POTENTIAL

01:04:02.538 --> 01:04:04.307
CONSEQUENCES OF FUTURE DUI

01:04:04.373 --> 01:04:06.209
OFFENSES AND EVEN THE PASSAGE OF

01:04:06.275 --> 01:04:08.377
PROPOSITION 36 INCLUDES WHAT I

01:04:08.444 --> 01:04:10.813
WOULD CATEGORIZE AS A VERBATIM

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:13.316
ADVISEMENT. IN THE NEWLY CREATED

01:04:13.382 --> 01:04:14.417
STATUTE, WE HAVE VERBATIM

01:04:14.483 --> 01:04:15.785
LANGUAGE FOR A VERY PARTICULAR

01:04:15.851 --> 01:04:16.986
REASON, AND I WILL JUST SAY THAT

01:04:17.053 --> 01:04:19.455
AS A PROSECUTOR, WHEN I WAS IN

01:04:19.522 --> 01:04:21.224
COURT AND GIVING ADVISEMENT TO A

01:04:21.290 --> 01:04:22.391
DEFENDANT, WHETHER IT WAS

01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:23.859
REGARDING IMMIGRATION

01:04:23.926 --> 01:04:25.228
CONSEQUENCES, REPEATED DUI

01:04:25.294 --> 01:04:28.164
OFFENSE, I ALWAYS KNEW THAT IF I

01:04:28.231 --> 01:04:28.764
WAS READING WHAT WAS IN THE

01:04:28.831 --> 01:04:30.166
STATUTE, THAT MY CONDUCT WAS

01:04:30.233 --> 01:04:31.334
COVERED, AND THAT THE DEFENDANT

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:33.169
HAD A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THE

01:04:33.236 --> 01:04:34.403
POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT

01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:37.106
THEY WERE ABOUT TO DO. AND QUITE

01:04:37.173 --> 01:04:37.707
FRANKLY, THAT STRENGTHENS OUR

01:04:37.773 --> 01:04:38.708
ABILITY TO DEFEND THESE

01:04:38.774 --> 01:04:39.942
CONVICTIONS. THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:04:40.009 --> 01:04:41.410
JUSTICE WHEN THEY COME ON

01:04:41.477 --> 01:04:42.378
APPEAL. SO WITH THAT, I HUMBLY

01:04:42.445 --> 01:04:45.314
ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU

01:04:45.381 --> 01:04:47.550
SO MUCH. OH, AND THE CHAIR IS

01:04:47.617 --> 01:04:49.552
RECOMMENDING AND I WAS JUST

01:04:49.619 --> 01:04:50.786
ABOUT TO SAY THAT THAT OUR CHAIR

01:04:50.853 --> 01:04:53.422
IS RECOMMENDING I VOTE AT THIS

01:04:53.489 --> 01:04:55.091
TIME. WE'LL GO AHEAD AND CALL

01:04:55.157 --> 01:04:55.958
THE ROLL. OH, I'M SORRY, I NEED

01:04:56.025 --> 01:04:58.327
A MOTION. SEE? WE'VE BEEN OUT SO

01:04:58.394 --> 01:05:00.563
LONG. CAN WE HAVE A MOTION TO

01:05:48.377 --> 01:06:01.991
OKAY. THANK YOU.

THAT'S RIGHT. YOU KNOW. I HOPE

01:06:09.732 --> 01:06:12.835
YOU ALL ENJOYED AS MUCH AS I DID

01:06:12.902 --> 01:06:14.236
WATCHING DOCTOR SHARPE COLLINS

01:06:14.303 --> 01:06:16.072
RUN THAT MEETING. THAT'S NOW

01:06:16.138 --> 01:06:17.473
THAT'S HOW A CHAIR REALLY WORKS.

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:20.376
WELL DONE, MY FRIEND. BEFORE WE

01:06:20.443 --> 01:06:22.211
MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT ITEM OF

01:06:22.278 --> 01:06:24.480
BUSINESS, I WOULD JUST LIKE TO

01:06:24.547 --> 01:06:25.081
NOTE AND CALL UPON ASSEMBLY

01:06:25.147 --> 01:06:26.449
MEMBER LACKEY. I SEE THAT THE

01:06:26.515 --> 01:06:27.917
VICE CHAIR HAS FINALLY DECIDED

01:06:27.983 --> 01:06:30.419
TO JOIN US. MR. BIRTHDAY BOY.

01:06:30.486 --> 01:06:33.022
MR. LACKEY, COULD I TROUBLE YOU

01:06:33.089 --> 01:06:34.023
TO LEAD US IN A HAPPY BIRTHDAY

NOW, BACK TO THE MORE SERIOUS

01:07:21.570 --> 01:07:29.044
MATTERS. OH, YES. ABSOLUTELY.

01:07:29.111 --> 01:07:30.980
ALL RIGHT. BACK TO THE ORDER OF

01:07:31.046 --> 01:07:33.149
BUSINESS. I SEE WE HAVE SENATOR

01:07:33.215 --> 01:07:34.817
MENGIBAR HERE. SO NEXT WE'LL

01:07:34.884 --> 01:07:36.419
TAKE UP ITEM NUMBER FIVE. THIS

01:07:36.485 --> 01:07:38.587
IS SENATE BILL 337 BY STATE

01:07:38.654 --> 01:07:39.922
SENATOR CAROLINE MENGIBAR,

01:07:39.989 --> 01:07:42.124
ENTITLED PRISONS. SENATOR, YOU

PRESENT, AS WILL YOUR WITNESSES

01:07:45.027 --> 01:07:46.662
AND SUPPORT, AND WE'LL GO FROM

01:07:46.729 --> 01:07:51.834
THERE. YOU RUN A TIGHT SHIP, MR.

01:07:51.901 --> 01:07:54.970
CHAIR. ALL RIGHT. FIRST I HAVE

01:07:55.037 --> 01:07:56.806
TO SAY, ASSEMBLY MEMBER, YOU'RE

01:07:56.872 --> 01:07:58.174
YOU'RE NICER THAN ME. I HAVEN'T

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:00.743
WORKED ON MY BIRTHDAY FOR THE

01:08:00.810 --> 01:08:01.811
PAST TEN YEARS. I REFUSE Ó GOOD

01:08:01.877 --> 01:08:03.379
FOR YOU. GOOD FOR YOU. LINE OF

01:08:03.446 --> 01:08:05.781
WORK. I USUALLY DID HAVE A

01:08:05.848 --> 01:08:07.583
CHOICE, MR. CHAIR. COLLEAGUES,

01:08:07.650 --> 01:08:09.919
I'M PRESENTING TO YOU SB 337.

01:08:09.985 --> 01:08:11.454
THAT AS YOU SAW IN THE ANALYSIS,

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:14.190
THERE WERE ABOUT 26 PROVISIONS

01:08:14.256 --> 01:08:15.724
OF WHAT THIS BILL IS LOOKING TO

01:08:15.791 --> 01:08:17.726
DO. IT'S REALLY ROBUST AND

01:08:17.793 --> 01:08:19.361
LOOKING TO CHANGE THE NATURE OF

01:08:19.428 --> 01:08:21.363
OUR PRISONS, PREDOMINANTLY,

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:22.665
PREDOMINANTLY OUR WOMEN PRISONS.

01:08:22.731 --> 01:08:24.366
I'M NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH

01:08:24.433 --> 01:08:25.034
EVERY SINGLE PROVISION OF WHAT

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:27.036
THIS BILL DOES, BUT JUST COVER

01:08:27.102 --> 01:08:29.305
THE UMBRELLA OF IT YOU'VE SEEN

01:08:29.371 --> 01:08:31.140
IN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS,

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:32.174
ARTICLE AFTER ARTICLE, ABOUT

01:08:32.241 --> 01:08:33.876
PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN PUT IN PLACE

01:08:33.943 --> 01:08:35.344
TO PROTECT, ESPECIALLY OUR WOMEN

01:08:35.411 --> 01:08:38.714
WHO WHO ARE INCARCERATED, BETRAY

01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:41.183
THAT TRUST FROM INDIVIDUALS WHO

01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:44.086
WERE CHARGED FOR UPWARDS OF 50

01:08:44.153 --> 01:08:46.255
COUNTS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT,

01:08:46.322 --> 01:08:48.390
SEXUAL ASSAULT OF WOMEN TO, MOST

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:50.025
RECENTLY, THE SOLE GYNECOLOGIST

01:08:50.092 --> 01:08:52.027
OF THE WOMEN'S PRISON ALSO NOW

01:08:52.094 --> 01:08:54.497
BEING CHARGED. IT'S IN AN

01:08:54.563 --> 01:08:56.298
ONGOING ISSUE AND THE SYSTEM

01:08:56.365 --> 01:08:58.367
NEEDS TO CHANGE. SO THIS BILL IS

01:08:58.434 --> 01:08:59.201
LOOKING TO ADDRESS THAT RIGHT

01:08:59.268 --> 01:09:00.970
NOW. CURRENTLY, THERE'S NO

01:09:01.036 --> 01:09:02.204
DOCUMENTATION THAT TAKES PLACE.

01:09:02.271 --> 01:09:05.274
IF AN OFFICER LOOKS TO SEARCH AN

01:09:05.341 --> 01:09:06.775
INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL, IT'S A

01:09:06.842 --> 01:09:08.244
HE SAID, SHE SAID KIND OF STORY.

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:10.679
WE WANT TO CHANGE THAT. WE WANT

01:09:10.746 --> 01:09:12.414
DOCUMENTATION TO HAPPEN. WE WANT

01:09:12.481 --> 01:09:14.016
TO HAVE A TRACK. WE WANT TO

01:09:14.083 --> 01:09:16.385
TRACK EVERY KIND OF INTERACTION.

01:09:16.452 --> 01:09:18.120
AND THIS KIND OF WORK IS JUST

01:09:18.187 --> 01:09:20.222
BUILDING OFF OF THE WORK THAT

01:09:20.289 --> 01:09:21.223
I'VE DONE PREVIOUSLY. AND THANK

01:09:21.290 --> 01:09:21.991
YOU. THANK THE ANALYSIS FOR

01:09:22.057 --> 01:09:23.392
ANNOTATING A PREVIOUS BILL THAT

01:09:23.459 --> 01:09:25.394
WAS PASSED. AND WE'RE LOOKING TO

01:09:25.461 --> 01:09:26.829
BUILD ON TO ON TO THAT. WE WANT

01:09:26.896 --> 01:09:32.301
TO MAKE SURE. GIVE ME ONE SECOND

01:09:32.368 --> 01:09:34.803
HERE. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:36.438
WE EXTEND THE GRIEVANCE FILING

01:09:36.505 --> 01:09:37.706
WINDOW FOR INCARCERATED

01:09:37.773 --> 01:09:39.909
INDIVIDUALS FROM 60 TO 120 DAYS,

01:09:39.975 --> 01:09:41.610
BECAUSE WE KNOW IT TAKES A WHILE

01:09:41.677 --> 01:09:43.379
TO GET OVER A TRAUMA. AND WE

01:09:43.445 --> 01:09:45.114
WANT WE DON'T WANT TO PUSH THEM

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:46.148
UNTIL THEY'RE READY TO COME

01:09:46.215 --> 01:09:48.951
FORWARD. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:49.518
THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING THESE

01:09:49.585 --> 01:09:50.119
GRIEVANCES ANONYMOUSLY BECAUSE

01:09:50.185 --> 01:09:51.420
WE KNOW RETALIATION IS REAL. WE

01:09:51.487 --> 01:09:53.856
WANT TO PROHIBIT HIRING CDCR

01:09:53.923 --> 01:09:55.291
STAFF OR APPLICANTS FOUND GUILTY

01:09:55.357 --> 01:09:57.860
OF VIOLENT OR SEXUAL CRIMES. AND

01:09:57.927 --> 01:09:59.728
WE WANT TO MANDATE THE

01:09:59.795 --> 01:10:00.996
TERMINATION AND PERMANENT

01:10:01.063 --> 01:10:02.865
ELIGIBILITY FOR REHIRE OF

01:10:02.932 --> 01:10:04.800
INDIVIDUALS WHO COMMIT SUCH

01:10:04.867 --> 01:10:06.168
CRIMES. IF YOU'RE WORKING IN AN

01:10:06.235 --> 01:10:07.870
ALL WOMEN'S PRISON AND YOU JUST

01:10:07.937 --> 01:10:10.139
WERE CHARGED WITH BEATING YOUR

01:10:10.205 --> 01:10:12.041
WIFE, YOU SHOULDN'T BE WORKING

01:10:12.107 --> 01:10:14.577
IN A PRISON THAT IS ONLY WOMEN.

01:10:14.643 --> 01:10:16.145
YOU HAVE A BIAS OR SOME KIND OF

01:10:16.211 --> 01:10:18.380
HATE TOWARDS THAT, THAT SEX AND

01:10:18.447 --> 01:10:20.082
THAT GENDER. AND WE WANT TO MAKE

01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:21.617
SURE THAT WHEN AN INVESTIGATION

01:10:21.684 --> 01:10:22.985
HAPPENS, THE CDCR LEAD

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:24.553
INVESTIGATOR DISCLOSES ANY

01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:26.255
PERSONAL CONNECTION TO THE

01:10:26.322 --> 01:10:28.490
PERSON THAT'S BEING ACCUSED OF

01:10:28.557 --> 01:10:29.425
SUCH CRIME. IF THEY'RE THEIR

01:10:29.491 --> 01:10:30.926
ROOMMATE, THEIR BROTHER, THEIR

01:10:30.993 --> 01:10:32.528
SISTER, WHAT HAVE YOU, THEY

01:10:32.595 --> 01:10:34.163
SHOULD RECUSE THEMSELVES FROM

01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:35.631
THAT. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:10:35.698 --> 01:10:37.900
THAT THEY'RE THAT CDCR ADOPTS

01:10:37.967 --> 01:10:39.201
AND UPDATES REGULARLY. THE

01:10:39.268 --> 01:10:41.203
PRISON RAPE ELIMINATION POLICY

01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:43.172
AND MAKE CLEAR THAT CDCR

01:10:43.238 --> 01:10:44.773
MAINTAINS A ZERO TOLERANCE

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:46.542
POLICY FOR ANY TYPE OF VIOLENCE,

01:10:46.609 --> 01:10:48.143
REGARDLESS OF WHO IS THE

01:10:48.210 --> 01:10:49.078
PERPETRATOR. BUT SO BASICALLY,

01:10:49.144 --> 01:10:50.679
WE'RE JUST CLOSING SOME

01:10:50.746 --> 01:10:53.082
LOOPHOLES. THIS IS A WORK THAT

01:10:53.148 --> 01:10:54.216
THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS HAS BEEN

01:10:54.283 --> 01:10:56.385
LEADING WITH, AND I FEEL PROUD

01:10:56.452 --> 01:10:57.886
TO BE PART OF THAT WORKING GROUP

01:10:57.953 --> 01:10:59.421
TO BRING FORWARD SOMETHING THAT

01:10:59.488 --> 01:11:00.055
IS GOING TO DRASTICALLY CHANGE

01:11:00.122 --> 01:11:02.024
THE LIVES OF WOMEN IN PRISON OR

01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:02.925
ANYONE IN PRISON. MR. CHAIR,

01:11:02.992 --> 01:11:05.194
NOW, I'D LIKE TO TURN OVER TO MY

01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:06.328

01:11:08.998 --> 01:11:10.366
YOU, CHAIR AND COMMITTEE

01:11:10.432 --> 01:11:12.001
MEMBERS. I AM APRIL GRAYSON, THE

01:11:12.067 --> 01:11:13.369
POLITICAL DIRECTOR OF SISTER

01:11:13.435 --> 01:11:15.437
FREEDOM COALITION. ON BEHALF OF

01:11:15.504 --> 01:11:17.072
THE CO-SPONSORS AND THE SEXUAL

01:11:17.139 --> 01:11:18.474
ABUSE RESPONSE AND PREVENTION

01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:21.076
WORKING GROUP. I SPEAK IN STRONG

01:11:21.143 --> 01:11:24.079
SUPPORT OF SB 337 BY SENATOR. SB

01:11:24.146 --> 01:11:25.781
337 MAKES IMPORTANT CHANGES TO

01:11:25.848 --> 01:11:27.783
THE REPORTING, INVESTIGATIONS

01:11:27.850 --> 01:11:29.218
AND DISCIPLINARY PROCESS THAT

01:11:29.284 --> 01:11:31.754
TAKES PLACE AFTER STAFF ABUSE

01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:34.023
OCCURS. ADDRESSING WELL-FOUNDED

01:11:34.089 --> 01:11:35.691
FEARS AND RETALIATION AND

01:11:35.758 --> 01:11:37.292
PREVENTING ABUSERS, INCLUDING

01:11:37.359 --> 01:11:39.828
MEDICAL STAFF, FOR PERPETRATING

01:11:39.895 --> 01:11:42.631
FURTHER HARM. BUT SB 337 ALSO

01:11:42.698 --> 01:11:43.599
INCLUDES CRITICAL MEASURES TO

01:11:43.666 --> 01:11:45.200
PREVENT SEXUAL ABUSE FROM

01:11:45.267 --> 01:11:46.635
OCCURRING IN THE FIRST PLACE. BY

01:11:46.702 --> 01:11:49.071
INCREASING OVERSIGHT, WE

01:11:49.138 --> 01:11:49.838
CONSISTENTLY HEAR FROM

01:11:49.905 --> 01:11:50.906
INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS ABOUT

01:11:50.973 --> 01:11:53.075
THE IMPROPER AND FREQUENT

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:54.810
DEACTIVATION OF BODY CAMERAS BY

01:11:54.877 --> 01:11:56.679
CUSTODY STAFF, OFTEN DURING

01:11:56.745 --> 01:11:58.113
INCIDENTS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT OR

01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:00.549
OTHER MISCONDUCT, BY CLOSING

01:12:00.616 --> 01:12:02.618
LOOPHOLES IN CDCR'S POLICY THAT

01:12:02.685 --> 01:12:03.952
ALLOW STAFF TO EVADE DETECTION

01:12:04.019 --> 01:12:06.055
OF THEIR ABUSE. THIS BILL OFFERS

01:12:06.121 --> 01:12:07.890
A STEP TOWARDS GREATER

01:12:07.956 --> 01:12:08.891
TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY

01:12:08.957 --> 01:12:11.994
WITHIN THESE FACILITIES. SB 337

01:12:12.061 --> 01:12:13.328
ALSO SEEKS TO ADDRESS THE

01:12:13.395 --> 01:12:14.630
INCREDIBLY PROBLEMATIC PRACTICE

01:12:14.697 --> 01:12:16.365
OF BODY SEARCHES, WHICH CAN BE

01:12:16.432 --> 01:12:18.167
ORDERED BY OFFICERS AT ANY TIME

01:12:18.233 --> 01:12:18.967
AND ARE REQUIRED FOR

01:12:19.034 --> 01:12:20.469
INCARCERATED PEOPLE TO BE ABLE

01:12:20.536 --> 01:12:22.571
TO VISIT THEIR FAMILY. EXCESSIVE

01:12:22.638 --> 01:12:23.906
AND TRAUMATIZING STRIP SEARCHES

01:12:23.972 --> 01:12:25.774
ARE A COMMON EXPERIENCE. WE

01:12:25.841 --> 01:12:26.842
FREQUENTLY HEAR HORRIFYING

01:12:26.909 --> 01:12:28.277
STORIES ABOUT NEVER ENDING STRIP

01:12:28.343 --> 01:12:29.545
SEARCHES AND INVASIVE PAT DOWNS

01:12:29.611 --> 01:12:31.547
THAT LEAD INDIVIDUALS TO STOP

01:12:31.613 --> 01:12:33.215
ACCEPTING ANY VISITS FROM THEIR

01:12:33.282 --> 01:12:33.949
LOVED ONES BECAUSE THEY FEAR A

01:12:34.016 --> 01:12:36.518
REPEAT EXPERIENCE. SB 337 WILL

01:12:36.585 --> 01:12:38.153
REQUIRE DOCUMENTATION OF EVERY

01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:39.521
SEARCH AND SCAN, CREATING A

01:12:39.588 --> 01:12:41.657
PAPER TRAIL OF ABUSIVE SEARCHES

01:12:41.724 --> 01:12:42.825
AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR AN

01:12:42.891 --> 01:12:44.059
ADVOCATE TO BE REQUESTED. ADDING

01:12:44.126 --> 01:12:46.361
REAL TIME OVERSIGHT TO A VERY

01:12:46.428 --> 01:12:47.763
VULNERABLE AND TRAUMATIZING

01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:49.832
SITUATION. WE APPRECIATE SENATOR

01:12:49.898 --> 01:12:51.467
SENATOR DRIVER'S CONTINUED

01:12:51.533 --> 01:12:52.768
LEADERSHIP AND HER WILLINGNESS

01:12:52.835 --> 01:12:53.435
TO INCORPORATE KEY

01:12:53.502 --> 01:12:54.636
RECOMMENDATIONS FROM OUR WORKING

01:12:54.703 --> 01:12:56.438
GROUP'S REPORT, WHICH WAS BASED

01:12:56.505 --> 01:12:58.273
ON OUTREACH TO OVER 700

01:12:58.340 --> 01:12:59.975
INCARCERATED PEOPLE IN CDCR'S

01:13:00.042 --> 01:13:02.411
WOMEN'S DESIGNATED PRISONS. SB

01:13:02.478 --> 01:13:04.213
337 DIRECTLY ADDRESSES THEIR

01:13:04.279 --> 01:13:05.380
CONCERNS, AND WE FIRMLY BELIEVE

01:13:05.447 --> 01:13:06.849
THAT THESE MEASURES WILL

01:13:06.915 --> 01:13:08.584
SIGNIFICANTLY, SIGNIFICANTLY

01:13:08.650 --> 01:13:10.486
ENHANCE THE SAFETY OF BOTH

PRISONS, REGARDLESS OF HOW THEY

01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:45.747
IDENTIFY. THIS BILL HAS A

01:14:45.814 --> 01:14:48.050
COMMENDABLE GOAL OF ZERO

01:14:48.116 --> 01:14:49.818

CRIMES. SINCE SB 132 HAS BEEN IN

01:15:03.932 --> 01:15:06.835
EFFECT, 45 MEN MASQUERADING AS

01:15:06.902 --> 01:15:08.337
WOMEN HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO

01:15:08.403 --> 01:15:10.105
FEMALE PRISONS. AND ACCORDING TO

01:15:10.172 --> 01:15:12.574
THE CDC REPORT FROM THIS PAST

01:15:12.641 --> 01:15:14.643

INMATES SEEKING TRANSFER IS A

01:15:27.122 --> 01:15:28.657
REGISTERED SEX OFFENDER. THAT'S

A TOTAL OF 1151 MALES COULD BE

01:15:31.326 --> 01:15:33.428
PLACED INTO THE FEMALE PRISON

01:15:33.495 --> 01:15:34.830
SYSTEM, AND THERE ARE CURRENTLY

01:15:34.897 --> 01:15:37.299
ABOUT 4000 FEMALE PRISONERS. SO

01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:40.269
THAT MEANS UP TO 25% OF THE

01:15:40.335 --> 01:15:42.004
INMATES HELD IN FEMALE PRISONS

01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:44.539

01:15:44.606 --> 01:15:47.809
SINK IN. HOW MANY MURDERS,

01:15:47.876 --> 01:15:49.444
RAPES, SEXUAL ASSAULTS, BEATINGS

01:15:49.511 --> 01:15:51.747
AND PREGNANCIES DO YOU THINK

01:15:51.813 --> 01:15:52.514
WILL OCCUR AS MORE MALES POUR

01:15:52.581 --> 01:15:55.450
INTO OUR FEMALE PRISONS? IF YOU

01:15:55.517 --> 01:15:57.753
THINK THIS BILL IS GOOD ENOUGH

01:15:57.819 --> 01:15:59.821
BECAUSE MOST SEXUAL ASSAULTS ARE

01:15:59.888 --> 01:16:03.592
COMMITTED BY GUARDS, ASK A RAPE

01:16:03.659 --> 01:16:05.761
VICTIM IS IT LESS OF A RAPE

01:16:05.827 --> 01:16:08.497
BECAUSE THE RAPIST WAS A MALE

01:16:08.563 --> 01:16:10.499
INMATE INSTEAD OF A GUARD? IF

01:16:10.565 --> 01:16:12.301
TRANS IDENTIFIED MALE HARMED IN

01:16:12.367 --> 01:16:14.136
MALE PRISONS, THE PROBLEM SHOULD

01:16:14.202 --> 01:16:17.339
BE ADDRESSED THERE. WOMEN ARE

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:19.274
NOT HUMAN SHIELDS FOR MALE ON

01:16:19.341 --> 01:16:21.777
MALE VIOLENCE VIOLENCE. I URGE A

PAUSE YOUR TIME BECAUSE THERE

A CHANCE TO RESPOND. MY

01:19:12.047 --> 01:19:13.115
UNDERSTANDING IS EVERYTHING THAT

WE JUST HEARD HAS HAS NOTHING TO

01:19:14.516 --> 01:19:16.051
DO WITH THIS BILL. IT'S NOT

01:19:16.118 --> 01:19:17.385
GERMANE TO THIS BILL. I'M NOT

01:19:17.452 --> 01:19:20.055
SURE WHAT WHAT THE PURPOSE OF

01:19:20.122 --> 01:19:21.857
THE OPPOSITION TESTIMONY WAS,

01:19:21.923 --> 01:19:23.291
BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE BILL

01:19:23.358 --> 01:19:24.960
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING

01:19:25.026 --> 01:19:27.062
WE JUST HEARD. IS THAT CORRECT?

01:19:27.129 --> 01:19:28.196
THAT THAT'S CORRECT. ASSEMBLY

01:19:28.263 --> 01:19:29.998
MEMBER. AND, YOU KNOW, AS AS

01:19:30.065 --> 01:19:31.933
BACKGROUND INFORMATION AS FAR

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.369
BACK AS 2011, 2012, DOJ DID

01:19:34.436 --> 01:19:36.171
THEIR OWN RESEARCH AND FOUND

01:19:36.238 --> 01:19:40.208
THAT CLOSE TO 60% OF 58.9% OF

01:19:40.275 --> 01:19:42.110
THE RAPE CASES IN OUR PRISONS

01:19:42.177 --> 01:19:43.945
WERE DONE BY STAFF ONTO THE

01:19:44.012 --> 01:19:45.380
INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL. MOST

01:19:45.447 --> 01:19:48.049
RECENT REPORT CAME OUT OF 2023

01:19:48.116 --> 01:19:50.485
BY CDCR'S OWN REPORT, THAT NOW

01:19:50.552 --> 01:19:53.455
HAS JUMPED TO 68% OF THE CASES

01:19:53.522 --> 01:19:56.324
OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT OR SEXUAL

01:19:56.391 --> 01:19:58.827
ASSAULT IS COMING FROM STAFF. SO

01:19:58.894 --> 01:20:00.562
MY BILL, AS YOU'VE HEARD, IS

01:20:00.629 --> 01:20:02.731
DEALING WITH THAT MAJORITY OF

01:20:02.797 --> 01:20:04.699
THE CASES THERE AND WANTS TO

01:20:04.766 --> 01:20:07.102
BRING SOME REPRIEVE TO THE

01:20:07.169 --> 01:20:08.570
INDIVIDUALS IN THESE PRISONS,

01:20:08.637 --> 01:20:10.539
THE ISSUES THAT THE OPPOSITION

01:20:10.605 --> 01:20:12.174
HAVE BROUGHT UP. I'M NEVER GOING

01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:13.975
TO TAKE AWAY RAPE IS A RAPE. I'M

01:20:14.042 --> 01:20:16.511
I WILL NEVER RANK A RAPE IN A

01:20:16.578 --> 01:20:18.146
HIERARCHY. I THINK THEY ALL HAVE

01:20:18.213 --> 01:20:20.448
VALUE TO IT, AND I RECOGNIZE THE

01:20:20.515 --> 01:20:21.750
ISSUES THAT THEY'RE BRINGING UP.

01:20:21.816 --> 01:20:23.652
BUT MY BILL IS FOCUSING ON THE

01:20:23.718 --> 01:20:26.221
BIGGER PICTURE OF OUR PRISONS.

01:20:26.288 --> 01:20:27.489
AND YOU'RE RIGHT, ASSEMBLY

01:20:27.556 --> 01:20:30.125
MEMBER HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SB

01:20:30.192 --> 01:20:31.126
132. THANK YOU. APPRECIATE IT.

01:20:31.193 --> 01:20:33.261
I'LL MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU.

01:20:33.328 --> 01:20:34.896
ALL RIGHT. BEFORE WE GO ON, I

01:20:34.963 --> 01:20:36.431
HAVE A MOTION FROM IS THERE A

01:20:36.498 --> 01:20:38.033
SECOND SECOND. CAN WE HAVE A

01:20:38.099 --> 01:20:40.101
SECOND BY DOCTOR SHARPE COLLINS

01:20:40.168 --> 01:20:41.002
AND A THIRD BY MR. GONZALEZ.

01:20:41.069 --> 01:20:42.103
WE'LL CONTINUE WITH QUESTIONS

01:20:42.170 --> 01:20:43.405
AND COMMENTS. WOULD ANYONE ELSE

01:20:43.471 --> 01:20:45.207
LIKE TO GO? YES. MR. GONZALEZ,

01:20:45.273 --> 01:20:46.174
TO THE WITNESSES THAT ARE HERE,

01:20:46.241 --> 01:20:48.810
I'M JUST A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED.

01:20:48.877 --> 01:20:49.511
SO THE BILL THAT THE SENATOR

01:20:49.578 --> 01:20:50.745
BROUGHT FORWARD ESTABLISHES FOUR

01:20:50.812 --> 01:20:52.480
THINGS, WHICH IS GUARDRAILS FOR

01:20:52.547 --> 01:20:53.114
THE OPERATIONS OF BODY CAMERAS

01:20:53.181 --> 01:20:55.016
AND PRISONS, REQUIRING

01:20:55.083 --> 01:20:55.917
INCARCERATED PERSONS TO BE

01:20:55.984 --> 01:20:57.152
GRANTED AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE

01:20:57.219 --> 01:20:58.553
AN ADVOCATE WHEN BEING CAVITY

01:20:58.620 --> 01:20:59.721
SEARCH, STRIP SEARCHED AND BODY

01:20:59.788 --> 01:21:00.789
SCANNED CONTRACTS. HIRING

01:21:00.855 --> 01:21:02.057
PROMOTIONS CANNOT BE MADE WITH

01:21:02.123 --> 01:21:02.824
PEOPLE CONVICTED OF SEXUAL

01:21:02.891 --> 01:21:03.858
ASSAULT AND ESTABLISHES A

01:21:03.925 --> 01:21:05.160
GRIEVANCE PROCESS FOR

01:21:05.227 --> 01:21:06.161
INCARCERATED FOLKS TO ACCESS

01:21:06.228 --> 01:21:07.696
REPORT OF MISCONDUCT. I DON'T

01:21:07.762 --> 01:21:09.064
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEANT BY

01:21:09.130 --> 01:21:10.799
MASQUERADING AS A MEN. MEN HAD

01:21:10.865 --> 01:21:12.200
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS. I FIND

01:21:12.267 --> 01:21:13.034
THAT INCREDIBLY OFFENSIVE. AND

01:21:13.101 --> 01:21:14.769
YOU'RE HIJACKING THIS MOMENT TO

01:21:14.836 --> 01:21:16.104
PUT FORWARD YOUR OWN AGENDA

01:21:16.171 --> 01:21:17.973
AGAINST THE LGBTQ PLUS

01:21:18.039 --> 01:21:19.808
COMMUNITY. SO I'M NOT SURE WHAT

01:21:19.874 --> 01:21:21.943
ANY OF WHAT YOU SAID WAS ABOUT

01:21:22.010 --> 01:21:24.145
IS ACCURATE AND IT'S COMPLETELY

01:21:24.212 --> 01:21:25.413
OFFENSIVE. IT'S NOT A QUESTION.

01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:27.415
IT'S A STATEMENT WE CAN MOVE ON.

01:21:27.482 --> 01:21:28.617
THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. OTHER

01:21:28.683 --> 01:21:30.252
DOCTOR SHARPE. COLLINS, PLEASE.

01:21:30.318 --> 01:21:32.320
THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK

01:21:32.387 --> 01:21:34.122
SENATOR MENJIVAR SO MUCH FOR

01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:34.990
BRINGING FORTH THIS THIS BILL. I

01:21:35.056 --> 01:21:37.425
WOULD LIKE TO COME ON AS A

01:21:37.492 --> 01:21:39.761
COAUTHOR AND I YES, THE REPORTS

01:21:39.828 --> 01:21:41.129
SHOW THAT ASSAULT HAS BEEN DONE

01:21:41.196 --> 01:21:42.397
BY OUR STAFF AND OUR WOMEN

01:21:42.464 --> 01:21:44.666
DESERVE TO BE HEARD, BELIEVED,

01:21:44.733 --> 01:21:45.500
PROTECTED, REGARDLESS OF THEM

01:21:45.567 --> 01:21:49.904
BEING HELD. YOU KNOW, BEING IN

01:21:49.971 --> 01:21:52.173
INCARCERATED. WHAT I DO WANT TO

01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:52.774
SAY IS THAT DOCUMENTATION IS

01:21:52.841 --> 01:21:54.309
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AS WE PUSH

01:21:54.376 --> 01:21:55.143
FOR LEGISLATION, WE KEEP TALKING

01:21:55.210 --> 01:21:56.811
ABOUT DOCUMENTING TO MAKE SURE

01:21:56.878 --> 01:21:57.979
THAT WE HAVE DATA TO SUPPORT

01:21:58.046 --> 01:21:59.347
RESEARCH AND SO FORTH. AND WHAT

01:21:59.414 --> 01:22:01.349
THIS BILL TO ME IS GOING TO DO

01:22:01.416 --> 01:22:02.751
IS ENSURE CLARITY, ENSURE THAT

01:22:02.817 --> 01:22:04.452
WE HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY,

01:22:04.519 --> 01:22:06.187
EFFICIENCY AND ALSO PREVENTION.

01:22:06.254 --> 01:22:08.023
ANOTHER THING IS THAT I SEE THAT

01:22:08.089 --> 01:22:09.858
THIS BILL SUPPORTS VICTIMS

01:22:09.924 --> 01:22:11.526
OVERALL WELL-BEING, BUT ALSO

01:22:11.593 --> 01:22:12.994
EMPOWERING THEM. AND THIS IS

01:22:13.061 --> 01:22:13.995
SOMETHING THAT IS IMPORTANT TO

01:22:14.062 --> 01:22:16.298
ME. THIS BILL PROMOTES JUSTICE

01:22:16.364 --> 01:22:18.900
AND TO ME, A HEALING PROCESS FOR

01:22:18.967 --> 01:22:20.135
SURVIVORS AS A, YOU KNOW, AS

01:22:20.201 --> 01:22:22.203
THEY CONTINUE TO GO THROUGH THIS

01:22:22.270 --> 01:22:23.838
PROCESS. SO I HAVE THE UTMOST

01:22:23.905 --> 01:22:25.040
RESPECT FOR YOU FOR BRINGING

01:22:25.106 --> 01:22:25.974
FORTH THIS BILL, AND I

01:22:26.041 --> 01:22:27.309
APPRECIATE YOU CONTINUING TO

01:22:27.375 --> 01:22:28.910
MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE

01:22:28.977 --> 01:22:29.778
DOCUMENTATION FOR THESE CASES

01:22:29.844 --> 01:22:31.313
AND THAT JUSTICE IS DONE. SO

01:22:31.379 --> 01:22:33.248
THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU,

01:22:33.315 --> 01:22:33.848
DOCTOR SHARPE. COLLINS, OTHER

01:22:33.915 --> 01:22:36.418
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ALL

01:22:36.484 --> 01:22:38.353
RIGHT. WITHOUT THERE BEING

01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:40.188
FURTHER QUESTION OR COMMENTS,

01:22:40.255 --> 01:22:41.623
FIRST OF ALL, SENATOR, I'LL GIVE

01:22:41.690 --> 01:22:43.058
YOU A CHANCE TO CLOSE AND THEN

01:22:43.124 --> 01:22:44.793
I'LL GIVE MY RECOMMENDATION.

01:22:44.859 --> 01:22:45.860
THANK THANK YOU, MISTER CHAIR.

01:22:45.927 --> 01:22:48.129
LISTEN, IF IT WAS UP TO ME, I

01:22:48.196 --> 01:22:49.230
WOULD ERADICATE RAPE ACROSS NOT

01:22:49.297 --> 01:22:51.166
JUST OUR PRISONS, BUT THE ENTIRE

01:22:51.232 --> 01:22:52.967
WORLD. I THINK THAT IS ONE OF

01:22:53.034 --> 01:22:54.903
THE MOST, IF NOT THE MOST

01:22:54.969 --> 01:22:56.638
TRAUMATIZING THING A PERSON CAN

01:22:56.705 --> 01:22:58.473
GO THROUGH. AND WE RECOGNIZE

01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:00.175
THAT WOMEN ARE PREDOMINANTLY AT

01:23:00.241 --> 01:23:02.310
THE RECEIVING END OF THAT ACT.

01:23:02.377 --> 01:23:04.145
NOW, WOMEN WHO ARE INCARCERATED

01:23:04.212 --> 01:23:05.814
HAVE ALREADY BEEN TRAUMATIZED,

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:08.216
AND REPORTS SHOW THAT A LOT OF

01:23:08.283 --> 01:23:10.452
TIMES THEY COME IN FOR A CHARGE

01:23:10.518 --> 01:23:12.854
AND THEY HAVE HISTORY OF SEXUAL

01:23:12.921 --> 01:23:13.988
ASSAULT. WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE

01:23:14.055 --> 01:23:16.057
BEING RETRAUMATIZED IN OUR

01:23:16.124 --> 01:23:18.693
PRISONS. I DO AGAIN WANT TO

01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:22.497
ELEVATE THE ISSUES AND NOT

01:23:22.564 --> 01:23:24.332
DEVALUE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT

01:23:24.399 --> 01:23:25.166
THE OPPOSITION DID MENTION,

01:23:25.233 --> 01:23:27.035
BECAUSE, AGAIN, RAPE IS RAPE. AT

01:23:27.102 --> 01:23:29.504
THE END OF THE DAY, WE NEED TO

01:23:29.571 --> 01:23:30.772
MOVE THE NEEDLE CLOSER TO SURE,

01:23:30.839 --> 01:23:31.840
ENSURING THE SAFETY OF THE

01:23:31.906 --> 01:23:33.274
INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT

01:23:33.341 --> 01:23:35.143
UNDER OUR CARE IN THE STATE OF

01:23:35.210 --> 01:23:35.977
CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL MOVES IN

01:23:36.044 --> 01:23:38.346
THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND GETS US

01:23:38.413 --> 01:23:40.215
CLOSER TO BRINGING SOME JUSTICE

01:23:40.281 --> 01:23:41.049
TO INDIVIDUALS. I THINK IT'S

01:23:41.116 --> 01:23:43.184
IMPORTANT TO HAVE A THIRD PARTY

01:23:43.251 --> 01:23:43.885
ADVOCATE. WHENEVER YOU'RE

01:23:43.952 --> 01:23:45.320
GETTING SEARCHED, YOU WANT TO

01:23:45.387 --> 01:23:46.187
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE SOMEBODY

01:23:46.254 --> 01:23:48.256
THAT'S GOING TO BE ON YOUR SIDE.

01:23:48.323 --> 01:23:49.157
WITH YOUR SUPPORT, WE CAN MAKE

01:23:49.224 --> 01:23:52.060
SURE WE CAN GET TO THAT SAFER

01:23:52.127 --> 01:23:53.762
ENVIRONMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS

01:23:53.828 --> 01:23:54.562
UNDER THEIR CARE. RESPECTFULLY

01:23:54.629 --> 01:23:57.632
ASKING FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK

01:23:57.699 --> 01:23:59.267
YOU, SENATOR MENGIBAR

01:23:59.334 --> 01:24:00.301
COLLEAGUES, THE CHAIR IS

01:24:00.368 --> 01:24:01.803
RECOMMENDING AN AYE. I WOULD

01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:04.372
LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR

01:24:04.439 --> 01:24:04.973
BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD. I

01:24:05.039 --> 01:24:05.774
ESPECIALLY APPRECIATED YOUR

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:06.741
COMMENTS AND YOUR CLOSING.

01:24:06.808 --> 01:24:08.243
MA'AM, I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE

01:24:08.309 --> 01:24:09.744
THAT SEXUAL ABUSE, SEXUAL

01:24:09.811 --> 01:24:11.646
ASSAULT IN OUR STATE PRISONS, IT

01:24:11.713 --> 01:24:13.381
IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO

01:24:13.448 --> 01:24:14.215
ERADICATE. I WISH I COULD SAY

01:24:14.282 --> 01:24:16.017
THAT ONE BILL IS GOING TO SOLVE

01:24:16.084 --> 01:24:17.952
THE ENTIRE PROBLEM. THIS IS A

01:24:18.019 --> 01:24:19.387
SUBSTANTIAL AND GOOD START TO

01:24:19.454 --> 01:24:20.889
MOVE THE NEEDLE. AS YOU SAID.

01:24:20.955 --> 01:24:23.491
SENATOR MENGIBAR, WHAT I WOULD

01:24:23.558 --> 01:24:26.294
JUST NOTE IS THAT IN 2024, OVER

01:24:26.361 --> 01:24:29.364
130 PEOPLE, WOMEN, YES, WHO WERE

01:24:29.431 --> 01:24:30.999
INCARCERATED AT CALIFORNIA

01:24:31.065 --> 01:24:32.100
INSTITUTION FOR WOMEN AND THE

01:24:32.167 --> 01:24:33.535
CENTRAL CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S

01:24:33.601 --> 01:24:35.236
FACILITY FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST

01:24:35.303 --> 01:24:37.672
CDCR ALLEGING SEXUAL ABUSE BY 30

01:24:37.739 --> 01:24:39.174
CURRENT AND FORMER CORRECTIONAL

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:41.075
OFFICERS. THIS ISN'T SOME

01:24:41.142 --> 01:24:42.510
ABSTRACT OR THEORETICAL

01:24:42.577 --> 01:24:43.878
EXERCISE. THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT

01:24:43.945 --> 01:24:45.380
EXISTS IN OUR STATE PRISON RIGHT

01:24:45.447 --> 01:24:47.515
NOW. I ALSO SIT ON BUDGET SUB

01:24:47.582 --> 01:24:49.050
SIX, AND WE HAD A CHANCE TO DIVE

01:24:49.117 --> 01:24:51.286
DEEP ON THIS ISSUE. AND I HAVE

01:24:51.352 --> 01:24:52.821
TO SAY, I AM NOT CONVINCED

01:24:52.887 --> 01:24:55.023
WHATSOEVER THAT CDCR HAS A HAS A

01:24:55.089 --> 01:24:56.224
HANDLE ON THE SITUATION OR IS

01:24:56.291 --> 01:24:57.258
REALLY WORKING TO THE AT LEAST

01:24:57.325 --> 01:24:58.927
TO MY SATISFACTION, TO REMEDY

01:24:58.993 --> 01:25:01.196
THE PROBLEM. SENATOR BILL,

01:25:01.262 --> 01:25:03.364
HOWEVER, DOES IT IS A

01:25:03.431 --> 01:25:04.432
SUBSTANTIAL EFFORT TO PUT IN

01:25:04.499 --> 01:25:05.834
PLACE MORE PROTECTIONS AND TO DO

01:25:05.900 --> 01:25:08.036
WHAT WE CAN TO LIMIT WHAT IS

01:25:08.102 --> 01:25:09.003
HAPPENING IN OUR STATE PRISONS.

01:25:09.070 --> 01:25:10.505
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THERE'S

01:25:10.572 --> 01:25:12.207
GOING TO BE MORE LEGISLATION TO

01:25:12.273 --> 01:25:13.908
FOLLOW, BUT I THINK THIS IS

01:25:13.975 --> 01:25:14.476
ABSOLUTELY SOMETHING THAT WE

01:25:14.542 --> 01:25:16.911
NEED TO MOVE FORWARD TODAY. AND

01:25:16.978 --> 01:25:17.479

DON'T SEE ANYONE HERE. SO DOING

PROBLEMATIC FOR MY DISTRICT. THE

01:47:39.419 --> 01:47:42.522
SVP PLACEMENT SYSTEM. WE'VE HAD

01:47:42.589 --> 01:47:45.158
A LOT OF CONTROVERSY AND I'VE

01:47:45.225 --> 01:47:48.361

01:47:49.729 --> 01:47:52.299
IN COURT. AND FOR EXAMPLE, WE'VE

01:47:52.365 --> 01:47:55.202
HAD A PERSON I WON'T MENTION HIS

01:47:55.268 --> 01:47:56.536
NAME, BUT HE WAS KNOWN AS THE

01:47:56.603 --> 01:48:01.575
CAPE RACIST RAPIST. AND HE HE'S

01:48:01.641 --> 01:48:04.544
A VERY TOXIC MAN, AND HE'S BEEN

01:48:04.611 --> 01:48:07.147
PLACED TWICE IN OUR DISTRICT.

01:48:07.214 --> 01:48:10.317

01:48:10.383 --> 01:48:13.086
NEEDS HELP. AND WE PUT PEOPLE IN

01:48:13.153 --> 01:48:15.088
JEOPARDY FOR NO, NO REASON AT

01:48:16.556 --> 01:48:18.158
JUSTIFICATION OTHER THAN I LIVE

01:48:18.225 --> 01:48:20.660

UNDERLYING CONDUCT, WHICH MAY

01:51:56.676 --> 01:51:58.244
HAVE PROMPTED THE CR A HEARING

01:51:58.311 --> 01:51:59.913
TO BE INSTIGATED IN THE FIRST

01:51:59.979 --> 01:52:02.215
PLACE, HOWEVER, IS STILL FAIR

01:52:02.282 --> 01:52:04.984
GAME AND CAN BE USED IN THE

01:52:05.051 --> 01:52:05.819
ADMINISTRATIVE, EMPLOYMENT AND

01:52:05.885 --> 01:52:07.420
POST DECERTIFICATION CONTEXT. IN

01:52:07.487 --> 01:52:10.757
OTHER WORDS, PUT IN A DIFFERENT

01:52:10.824 --> 01:52:12.892
CONTEXT. NOTHING IN THIS BILL

01:52:12.959 --> 01:52:14.527
CHANGES HOW OR WHEN DEFENDANTS

01:52:14.594 --> 01:52:16.930
CAN RAISE CLAIMS OR THE TYPES OF

01:52:16.996 --> 01:52:19.866
REMEDIES A DEFENDANT CAN RECEIVE

01:52:19.933 --> 01:52:22.669
UNDER THE CR. WE WERE VERY

01:52:22.735 --> 01:52:23.570
CAREFUL NOT TO CHANGE THAT

01:52:23.636 --> 01:52:27.540
PROCESS. SB 734 SIMPLY PROVIDES

01:52:27.607 --> 01:52:29.542
DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS FOR LAW

01:52:29.609 --> 01:52:31.010
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. AND AS YOU

01:52:31.077 --> 01:52:35.682
KNOW THAT THE PROCESS NOW

01:52:35.748 --> 01:52:37.617
REQUIRES YOU TO HAVE TO BE IN

01:52:37.684 --> 01:52:40.253
GOOD STANDING AND TO BE

01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:43.156
LICENSED, IF YOU WILL, BY POST.

01:52:43.223 --> 01:52:45.225
AND SO THAT'S THE REASON THAT

01:52:45.291 --> 01:52:48.561
THIS PROCESS HAS TO BE

01:52:48.628 --> 01:52:50.296
SEPARATED, BECAUSE IF YOU'RE

01:52:50.363 --> 01:52:52.031
GOING TO TAKE AWAY THE

01:52:52.098 --> 01:52:52.799
LIVELIHOOD OF AN INDIVIDUAL,

01:52:52.866 --> 01:52:54.400
THEY SHOULD HAVE THE DUE PROCESS

01:52:54.467 --> 01:52:56.536
RIGHTS THAT ARE AFFORDED TO

01:52:56.603 --> 01:52:58.738
EVERYONE IN TERMS OF AN

01:52:58.805 --> 01:53:01.241
EMPLOYMENT SETTING. SO WITH ME

01:53:01.307 --> 01:53:02.942
TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE

01:53:03.009 --> 01:53:04.410
BILL ARE TIM TALBERT AND RANDY

01:53:04.477 --> 01:53:05.545
PERRY, REPRESENTING THE PEACE

01:53:05.612 --> 01:53:07.247
OFFICERS RESEARCH ASSOCIATION OF

01:53:07.313 --> 01:53:08.781
CALIFORNIA. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR

01:53:08.848 --> 01:53:11.951
YOUR VOTE. READY FOR YOU

01:53:12.018 --> 01:53:13.186
WHENEVER YOU ARE. THANK YOU. BY

01:53:13.253 --> 01:53:15.555
THE WAY, SENATOR, MISTER CHAIR

01:53:15.622 --> 01:53:16.523
MEMBERS, RANDY PERRY, ON BEHALF

01:53:16.589 --> 01:53:19.592
OF PORAC, THE STATEMENT

01:53:19.659 --> 01:53:20.960
BASICALLY SAID IT ALL, SO

01:53:21.027 --> 01:53:22.462
THERE'S NOT MUCH LEFT. I WOULD

01:53:22.529 --> 01:53:25.331
JUST ADD THAT WE WERE IN

01:53:25.398 --> 01:53:26.699
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE

01:53:26.766 --> 01:53:27.901
OPPOSITION, WORKED WITH THEM,

01:53:27.967 --> 01:53:30.303
TOOK MANY AMENDMENTS TO THE

01:53:30.370 --> 01:53:32.472
BILL, AND I BELIEVE REMOVED

01:53:32.539 --> 01:53:35.375
NEARLY ALL OF IT. WE JUST WANT

01:53:35.441 --> 01:53:37.577
TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE BILL

01:53:37.644 --> 01:53:39.345
AND KEEP WORKING ON ANY OF THE

01:53:39.412 --> 01:53:42.582
ISSUES. AGAIN, THE MAIN ISSUE IS

01:53:42.649 --> 01:53:45.385
THAT WE DO NOT TOUCH THE CR IN

01:53:45.451 --> 01:53:47.120
ANY WAY. WE JUST SIMPLY AND BY

01:53:47.187 --> 01:53:49.088
THE WAY, THIS HAS PRECEDENCE

01:53:49.155 --> 01:53:51.558
WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT'S CALLED A

01:53:51.624 --> 01:53:53.726
BRADY SITUATION. THERE'S

01:53:53.793 --> 01:53:54.761
LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED BY

01:53:54.827 --> 01:53:57.630
THIS BODY THAT SAID THAT THE

01:53:57.697 --> 01:54:00.233
BRADY, THE BRADY ISSUE ITSELF IN

01:54:00.300 --> 01:54:03.136
AND OF ITSELF IS NOT AN ISSUE

01:54:03.203 --> 01:54:05.471
THAT WILL BE USED AS DISCIPLINE

01:54:05.538 --> 01:54:08.875
OR AN SB TWO VIOLATION IN

01:54:08.942 --> 01:54:10.710
ITSELF. BUT THE UNDERLYING ACT

01:54:10.777 --> 01:54:12.478
CAN BE WE DO NOT TOUCH THAT.

01:54:12.545 --> 01:54:14.180
THEY CAN STILL BE INVESTIGATED,

01:54:14.247 --> 01:54:17.116
STILL BE DISCIPLINED, STILL BE

01:54:17.183 --> 01:54:18.918
EVEN SENT AND DECERTIFIED UNDER

01:54:18.985 --> 01:54:22.555
THE BILL. THESE TWO LEAVE ME

01:54:22.622 --> 01:54:25.124
WITH VERY LITTLE TO ADD, SO I'LL

01:54:25.191 --> 01:54:27.293
TRY TO BE BRIEF. I THINK THE

01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:28.695
SENATOR IDENTIFIED EXACTLY WHAT

01:54:28.761 --> 01:54:31.931
THE ISSUE IS, IS SEPARATE THE

01:54:31.998 --> 01:54:33.366
FORUMS AND ENSURE THAT THE PEACE

01:54:33.433 --> 01:54:34.834
OFFICER IS AFFORDED ALL THE DUE

01:54:34.901 --> 01:54:36.970
PROCESS PROTECTIONS WITH RESPECT

01:54:37.036 --> 01:54:38.805
TO ONE THEIR EMPLOYMENT AND TWO,

01:54:38.871 --> 01:54:40.974
PROBABLY MOST IMPORTANTLY, THEIR

01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:42.342
CERTIFICATION AS A PEACE

01:54:42.408 --> 01:54:44.577
OFFICER. THOSE FORUMS PROVIDE

01:54:44.644 --> 01:54:46.279
ROBUST, ROBUST INVESTIGATIVE

01:54:46.346 --> 01:54:48.448
PROCESSES. AS A SENATOR SAID,

01:54:48.514 --> 01:54:51.317
THE BILL EXPRESSLY RETAINS THE

01:54:51.384 --> 01:54:52.952
ABILITY OF BOTH THE EMPLOYING

01:54:53.019 --> 01:54:55.054
AGENCY AND POST TO TAKE WHATEVER

01:54:55.121 --> 01:54:56.823
ACTION IS APPROPRIATE BASED ON

01:54:56.889 --> 01:54:58.891
THE FINDINGS THERE. AND THE

01:54:58.958 --> 01:55:01.861
CHALLENGE IS, IS THAT IN THESE

01:55:01.928 --> 01:55:04.264
HEARINGS, THE OFFICER WHO IS

01:55:04.330 --> 01:55:06.132
ACCUSED OF SOME SORT OF BIAS MAY

01:55:06.199 --> 01:55:07.934
NOT EVEN BE PRESENT, MAY NOT

01:55:08.001 --> 01:55:10.503
KNOW, AND CERTAINLY IS NOT A

01:55:10.570 --> 01:55:11.304
PARTY TO THE PROCEEDING WHERE

01:55:11.371 --> 01:55:12.972
THEY CAN ACTIVELY DEFEND

01:55:13.039 --> 01:55:14.407
THEMSELVES OR REFUTE OR REBUT

01:55:14.474 --> 01:55:16.276
THOSE ACCUSATIONS. AND SO A

01:55:16.342 --> 01:55:17.710
FINDING BY THE JUDGE FOR

01:55:17.777 --> 01:55:19.879
PURPOSES OF THE RJ SERVES THE

01:55:19.946 --> 01:55:22.015
PURPOSE AS TO THAT CRIMINAL

01:55:22.081 --> 01:55:23.383
DEFENDANT, BUT LEAVES THE

01:55:23.449 --> 01:55:25.618
OFFICER AND OTHERS. ACTUALLY, IT

01:55:25.685 --> 01:55:27.153
APPLIES TO ANY JUDICIAL OFFICER

01:55:27.220 --> 01:55:29.055
IN THOSE PROCEEDINGS, LEAVES

01:55:29.122 --> 01:55:32.158
THEM WITHOUT ANY RECOURSE TO

01:55:32.225 --> 01:55:33.893
DEFEND THEMSELVES IN THAT

01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:35.361
PROCESS. AND WHAT WE'RE JUST

01:55:35.428 --> 01:55:36.296
TRYING TO SAY IS, LOOK, IF

01:55:36.362 --> 01:55:38.731
YOU'RE GUILTY OF BIAS, THOSE

01:55:38.798 --> 01:55:41.000
OTHER TWO INVESTIGATORY

01:55:41.067 --> 01:55:43.169
PROCESSES WILL ROOT THAT OUT AND

01:55:43.236 --> 01:55:44.871
WE'LL TAKE THE APPROPRIATE

01:55:44.937 --> 01:55:46.439
ACTION. BUT YOU HAVE TO BE

01:55:46.506 --> 01:55:47.006

CHAIR. AND MEMBERS, I'M VERY

01:58:06.479 --> 01:58:09.015
PLEASED TO BE HERE PRESENTING SB

01:58:09.081 --> 01:58:11.284
551. NATIONAL RESEARCH HAS SHOWN

01:58:11.350 --> 01:58:13.719
THAT INCARCERATION NEGATIVELY

01:58:13.786 --> 01:58:14.787
IMPACTS THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL

01:58:14.854 --> 01:58:17.290
HEALTH OF CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS,

01:58:17.356 --> 01:58:19.058
DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS STAFF,

01:58:19.125 --> 01:58:21.294
AND INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS

01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:22.628
THEMSELVES. THE AVERAGE LIFE

01:58:22.695 --> 01:58:24.096
EXPECTANCY OF CORRECTIONAL

01:58:24.163 --> 01:58:27.700
OFFICERS TODAY IS 59 YEARS OLD,

01:58:27.767 --> 01:58:29.836
16 YEARS SHORTER THAN THOSE NOT

01:58:29.902 --> 01:58:31.604
WORKING IN CORRECTIONS. SUICIDE

01:58:31.671 --> 01:58:32.905
RATES FOR CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS

01:58:32.972 --> 01:58:35.575
ARE 39% HIGHER THAN NATIONAL

01:58:35.641 --> 01:58:38.544
WORKING AGE POPULATION AMONG

01:58:38.611 --> 01:58:39.679
INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS. EVERY

01:58:39.745 --> 01:58:41.614
YEAR OF IMPRISONMENT DECREASES

01:58:41.681 --> 01:58:43.115
THEIR LIFE EXPECTANCY BY TWO

01:58:43.182 --> 01:58:45.518
YEARS. AS OF 2022, THE SUICIDE

01:58:45.585 --> 01:58:47.487
RATE OF INCARCERATED PEOPLE

01:58:47.553 --> 01:58:52.725
INCREASED 4.6% TO 19.6 DEATHS

01:58:52.792 --> 01:58:55.394
PER 100,000 RESIDENTS. LET ME

01:58:55.461 --> 01:58:59.398
CORRECT THAT 4.6 POINTS ON THE

01:58:59.465 --> 01:59:01.567
SCALE. IT'S 19.6 DEATHS PER

01:59:01.634 --> 01:59:04.136
100,000 RESIDENTS. SO SB 551

01:59:04.203 --> 01:59:06.172
FORMALLY CODIFIES THE PRINCIPLES

01:59:06.239 --> 01:59:08.274
OF NORMALIZATION AND DYNAMIC

01:59:08.341 --> 01:59:10.142
SECURITY TO FOSTER A SAFER

01:59:10.209 --> 01:59:12.478
REHABILITATIVE CULTURE WITHIN

01:59:12.545 --> 01:59:14.447
CDCR. THESE PRINCIPLES ARE KEY

01:59:14.514 --> 01:59:15.615
COMPONENTS OF THE SAFEST PRISONS

01:59:15.681 --> 01:59:17.683
IN THE WORLD, AND ENCOURAGE AN

01:59:17.750 --> 01:59:19.085
OVERALL HEALTHIER ENVIRONMENT

01:59:19.151 --> 01:59:20.186
THROUGH THE USE OF ONGOING,

01:59:20.253 --> 01:59:21.854
RESPECTFUL COMMUNICATION BETWEEN

01:59:21.921 --> 01:59:23.322
STAFF AND RESIDENTS, REDUCING

01:59:23.389 --> 01:59:24.790
THE RISK OF STRESS, VIOLENCE,

01:59:24.857 --> 01:59:26.325
AND RECIDIVISM FOR INCREASED

01:59:26.392 --> 01:59:28.528
PUBLIC SAFETY. ALTHOUGH LIFE IN

01:59:28.594 --> 01:59:30.963
PRISON CAN NEVER BE THE SAME AS

01:59:31.030 --> 01:59:32.665
LIFE IN FREE SOCIETY, ACTIVE

01:59:32.732 --> 01:59:33.900
STEPS SHOULD BE TAKEN TO MAKE

01:59:33.966 --> 01:59:37.103
CONDITIONS IN PRISON AS CLOSE TO

01:59:37.169 --> 01:59:40.006
NORMAL LIFE AS POSSIBLE FOR

01:59:40.072 --> 01:59:41.340
SUCCESSFUL PERSONAL GROWTH AND

01:59:41.407 --> 01:59:43.943
SAFE REENTRY INTO SOCIETY. ASIDE

01:59:44.010 --> 01:59:45.411
FROM THE LACK OF LIBERTY ITSELF,

01:59:45.478 --> 01:59:47.146
OF COURSE, BY CODIFYING

01:59:47.213 --> 01:59:48.648
PRINCIPLES ALREADY KNOWN TO AND

01:59:48.714 --> 01:59:51.517
PRACTICED BY SOME OF OUR PRISON

01:59:51.584 --> 01:59:53.219
INSTITUTIONS, SB 551 WILL BRING

01:59:53.286 --> 01:59:55.121
CALIFORNIA CLOSER TO A PRISON

01:59:55.187 --> 01:59:56.455
CULTURE THAT PROMOTES

01:59:56.522 --> 01:59:57.490
ACCOUNTABILITY, REHABILITATION,

01:59:57.557 --> 01:59:59.825
AND SUCCESSFUL REENTRY. THANK

01:59:59.892 --> 02:00:01.494
YOU. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR

02:00:01.561 --> 02:00:04.096
YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH,

02:00:04.163 --> 02:00:05.431
SENATOR. BEFORE WE TAKE THE

02:00:05.498 --> 02:00:06.933
METOOS, ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES

02:00:06.999 --> 02:00:09.769
IN SUPPORT HOPING TO TESTIFY?

02:00:09.835 --> 02:00:11.103
OKAY, THEN ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD

02:00:39.298 --> 02:00:41.100
MUCH. IS THERE ANYONE HERE

02:00:41.167 --> 02:00:42.201
HOPING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION

02:00:42.268 --> 02:00:44.737
TO THE BILL? I SEE NO RESPONSE.

02:00:44.804 --> 02:00:46.339
ANYONE ELSE HOPING TO REGISTER

02:00:46.405 --> 02:00:49.408
AN OPINION ON THE BILL AT ALL?

02:00:49.475 --> 02:00:52.678
OKAY THEN THAT WILL BE QUICK.

02:00:52.745 --> 02:00:53.279
TURN IT BACK TO THE DAIS. ARE

02:00:53.346 --> 02:00:54.580
THERE ANY QUESTIONS, COMMENTS OR

02:00:54.647 --> 02:00:58.851
MOTIONS? I HAVE A PROBLEM. ALL

02:00:58.918 --> 02:01:00.186
RIGHT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY.

02:01:00.252 --> 02:01:03.489
YEAH, I'M. I'M CLEARLY NOT A

02:01:03.556 --> 02:01:04.991
THIS IS MORE JUST A STATEMENT.

02:01:05.057 --> 02:01:08.194
IT'S NOT A QUESTION. I'M FOR

02:01:08.260 --> 02:01:09.595
HUMANE TREATMENT AND PRISONS FOR

02:01:09.662 --> 02:01:13.833
SURE, BUT. PRISONS ARE SUPPOSED

02:01:13.899 --> 02:01:16.569
TO SERVE A PURPOSE OF PUNISHMENT

02:01:16.636 --> 02:01:18.204
THAT IS PART OF THE PUNITIVE

02:01:18.270 --> 02:01:20.973
SYSTEM AND AS CLOSE TO NORMAL

02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:23.509
LIFE AS POSSIBLE, I THINK,

02:01:23.576 --> 02:01:26.979
EXCEEDS HUMANITY. AND THE

02:01:27.046 --> 02:01:30.750
INTENTION OF PRISON AND

02:01:30.816 --> 02:01:35.187
INCARCERATION IS NOT REWARD. AND

02:01:35.254 --> 02:01:36.155
SOME OF THE PEOPLE,

02:01:36.222 --> 02:01:37.223
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT ARE ENGAGED

02:01:37.289 --> 02:01:39.759
IN CRIMINAL CONDUCT HAVE VERY

02:01:39.825 --> 02:01:41.560
DEPLORABLE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT

02:01:41.627 --> 02:01:44.597
HAVE PUT THEM IN ENCOURAGING

02:01:44.664 --> 02:01:46.332
SITUATIONS THAT HAVE LED TO

02:01:46.399 --> 02:01:51.137
TRAGEDY AND NORMAL LIFE TO ONE

02:01:51.203 --> 02:01:53.139
IS MUCH DIFFERENT THAN NORMAL

02:01:53.205 --> 02:01:54.874
LIFE TO ANOTHER. SO IT'S AN

02:01:54.940 --> 02:01:55.708
IMPOSSIBLE STANDARD. FIRST OF

02:01:55.775 --> 02:01:58.778
ALL, IN MY OPINION. AND

02:01:58.844 --> 02:02:01.147
SECONDLY, IT DOES NEED TO

02:02:01.213 --> 02:02:04.283
ACCOMPLISH A PUNITIVE ATMOSPHERE

02:02:04.350 --> 02:02:06.452
NOW OVERLY PUNITIVE. WE CAN

02:02:06.519 --> 02:02:08.254
DEBATE THAT ALL DAY LONG, AND I

02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:10.089
THINK WE SHOULD DEBATE THAT TO

02:02:10.156 --> 02:02:12.058
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT OVERLY

02:02:12.124 --> 02:02:13.726
PUNITIVE, BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE

02:02:13.793 --> 02:02:16.195
THAT HUMANE TREATMENT IS

02:02:16.262 --> 02:02:21.267
EXPECTED, BUT TO CREATE A HOME

02:02:21.333 --> 02:02:23.135
LIKE ATMOSPHERE, A LOT OF LOT OF

02:02:23.202 --> 02:02:25.004
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN PRISON

02:02:25.071 --> 02:02:26.972
HAVE NEVER HAD THAT. AND IT'S

02:02:27.039 --> 02:02:28.874
UNFORTUNATE, BUT IT'S A REALITY.

02:02:28.941 --> 02:02:31.110
AND SO WE DON'T WANT TO IMPROVE

02:02:31.177 --> 02:02:32.445
THEIR CONDITION. I MEAN, THAT'S

02:02:32.511 --> 02:02:33.512
CERTAINLY I WOULD HOPE THAT

02:02:33.579 --> 02:02:35.314
THAT'S NOT THE INTENTION OF THIS

02:02:35.381 --> 02:02:37.483
BILL, BUT NONETHELESS, I, I FEEL

02:02:37.550 --> 02:02:39.185
LIKE IT'S A NOBLE UNDERTAKING TO

02:02:39.251 --> 02:02:41.754
TRY TO NOT BE INHUMANE, BUT I

02:02:41.821 --> 02:02:44.590
THINK THIS EXCEEDS THAT. SO I'M

02:02:44.657 --> 02:02:47.693
NOT ABLE TO SUPPORT IT. ALL

02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:48.494
RIGHT. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

02:02:48.561 --> 02:02:49.762
MEMBER. ARE THERE ANY OTHER

02:02:49.829 --> 02:02:50.996
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE

02:02:51.063 --> 02:02:57.303
DAIS? ALL RIGHT THEN. ALL RIGHT

02:02:57.369 --> 02:02:59.071
COLLEAGUES, I CAN CALL FOR IT

02:02:59.138 --> 02:03:00.973
AFTERWARDS, BUT WE WILL NEED A

02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:01.941
MOTION. BUT BEFORE I CALL FOR

02:03:02.007 --> 02:03:03.075
IT, SENATOR CORTEZ, WOULD YOU

02:03:03.142 --> 02:03:04.944
LIKE TO PROVIDE A BRIEF CLOSING

02:03:05.010 --> 02:03:06.378
STATEMENT? YES. THANK YOU VERY

02:03:06.445 --> 02:03:08.080
MUCH, I APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY

02:03:08.147 --> 02:03:09.448
MEMBER LACKEY'S COMMENTS. HE AND

02:03:09.515 --> 02:03:13.552
I WERE AT LANCASTER PRISON NOT

02:03:13.619 --> 02:03:15.554
SO LONG AGO, WHERE MR. LACKEY

02:03:15.621 --> 02:03:18.758
PRESIDED OVER THE GRADUATION OF

02:03:18.824 --> 02:03:20.259
STUDENTS WHO WERE, IN SOME

02:03:20.326 --> 02:03:23.863
CASES, ELWA STUDENTS. ARGUABLY,

02:03:23.929 --> 02:03:24.964
IF THEIR SENTENCE STAYED THE

02:03:25.030 --> 02:03:26.832
SAME, THEY WOULDN'T REALLY NEED

02:03:26.899 --> 02:03:29.535
TO BE PREPARED FOR OUTSIDE

02:03:29.602 --> 02:03:31.170
SOCIETY OR RETURNING TO A

02:03:31.237 --> 02:03:32.138
NEIGHBORHOOD. BUT BECAUSE OF

02:03:32.204 --> 02:03:34.406
THAT PROGRAM THERE, WHICH I KNOW

02:03:34.473 --> 02:03:37.309
MR. LACKEY SUPPORTS, SOME OF

02:03:37.376 --> 02:03:42.181
THOSE ELWA GRADUATES OF THAT

02:03:42.248 --> 02:03:45.551
PROGRAM. ONE HAS BEEN

02:03:45.618 --> 02:03:47.019
RESENTENCED AND OTHERS ARE BEING

02:03:47.086 --> 02:03:48.754
CONSIDERED FOR RESENTENCING

02:03:48.821 --> 02:03:50.556
BECAUSE JUDGES BELIEVE THAT THEY

02:03:50.623 --> 02:03:53.159
ARE NOW PREPARED TO ENTER BACK

02:03:53.225 --> 02:03:55.227
INTO SOCIETY AFTER YEARS AND

02:03:55.294 --> 02:03:58.164
YEARS OF IMPRISONMENT. THAT'S

02:03:58.230 --> 02:04:00.966
REALLY KIND OF AN EXTREME CASE

02:04:01.033 --> 02:04:02.768
HERE. THIS BILL DOESN'T MANDATE

02:04:02.835 --> 02:04:03.836
ANYTHING LIKE THAT. ALL THIS

02:04:03.903 --> 02:04:06.806
BILL, ALL THIS BILL DOES IS, IS

02:04:06.872 --> 02:04:08.941
MAKE A DECLARATION, IF YOU WILL,

02:04:09.008 --> 02:04:13.579
OF THE LEGISLATURE'S DESIRE TO

02:04:13.646 --> 02:04:15.748
SEE THESE TWO PARTICULAR

02:04:15.815 --> 02:04:17.483
PRINCIPLES, WHICH HAVE TO DO

02:04:17.550 --> 02:04:19.952
WITH HOW HOW CORRECTIONAL

02:04:20.019 --> 02:04:23.322
OFFICERS AND, AND THE PRISONERS

02:04:23.389 --> 02:04:25.624
THEMSELVES INTERACT. AND AGAIN,

02:04:25.691 --> 02:04:27.259
IT DOESN'T EVEN MANDATE THAT

02:04:27.326 --> 02:04:29.929
BEHAVIOR, BUT IT SIMPLY SAYS,

02:04:29.995 --> 02:04:31.197
THIS IS WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO

02:04:31.263 --> 02:04:33.465
SEE. WITH ABOUT 85% OF OUR

02:04:33.532 --> 02:04:35.601
PRISONERS RETURNING BACK TO OUR

02:04:35.668 --> 02:04:36.202
NEIGHBORHOODS, WE WOULD LIKE

02:04:36.268 --> 02:04:38.704
THEM TO BE PREPARED AS POSSIBLE

02:04:38.771 --> 02:04:40.339
FOR THAT REENTRY. AND SOMETIMES

02:04:40.406 --> 02:04:41.974
THAT NEEDS TO START WELL INTO

02:04:42.041 --> 02:04:44.310
THE PRISON PROCESS, NOT TWO

02:04:44.376 --> 02:04:45.811
WEEKS AFTER THEY GET OUT. THANK

02:04:45.878 --> 02:04:47.112
YOU. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR

02:04:47.179 --> 02:04:49.515
AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH,

02:04:49.582 --> 02:04:51.050
SENATOR. COLLEAGUES, THE CHAIR

02:04:51.116 --> 02:04:52.952
IS RECOMMENDING AN EYE ON THIS

02:04:53.018 --> 02:04:55.154
ONE. I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR

02:04:55.221 --> 02:04:56.856
FOR BRINGING FORWARD WHAT I FIND

02:04:56.922 --> 02:04:58.157
TO BE A VERY GOOD INTENTIONED

02:04:58.224 --> 02:05:01.260
AND COMMON SENSE MEASURE TO MY

02:05:01.327 --> 02:05:02.795
COLLEAGUE FROM PALMDALE. I WOULD

02:05:02.862 --> 02:05:04.129
SIMPLY SAY THAT WHEN I LOOK AT

02:05:04.196 --> 02:05:05.364
THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

02:05:05.431 --> 02:05:06.765
CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION,

02:05:06.832 --> 02:05:07.833
THERE ARE TWO GOALS THAT WE'RE

02:05:07.900 --> 02:05:09.668
TRYING TO SERVE. CERTAINLY, THE

02:05:09.735 --> 02:05:10.903
PUNITIVE ASPECT OF CORRECTIONS

02:05:10.970 --> 02:05:12.738
AND DETERRENCE IS CERTAINLY ONE

02:05:12.805 --> 02:05:14.039
WORTHY GOAL OF OUR JUSTICE

02:05:14.106 --> 02:05:16.342
SYSTEM, BUT I DON'T THINK WE'VE

02:05:16.408 --> 02:05:17.243
MADE THE INVESTMENT WE NEED TO

02:05:17.309 --> 02:05:18.444
DO IN REHABILITATION AND REALLY

02:05:18.510 --> 02:05:19.778
SETTING PEOPLE UP TO REINTEGRATE

02:05:19.845 --> 02:05:21.380
AND REENTER OUR SOCIETY. AND

02:05:21.447 --> 02:05:23.115
WHEN WE FAIL TO DO THAT, WE SEE

02:05:23.182 --> 02:05:24.917
THE RESULT PLAYING OUT ON OUR

02:05:24.984 --> 02:05:26.218
STREETS EVERY DAY. PEOPLE THAT

02:05:26.285 --> 02:05:28.020
HAVE NO CONNECTION TO HOUSING,

02:05:28.087 --> 02:05:28.854
NO CONNECTION TO JOB PLACEMENT,

02:05:28.921 --> 02:05:30.522
THEY FALL INTO HOMELESSNESS.

02:05:30.589 --> 02:05:31.624
THEY RE-OFFEND. IT IS INHUMANE.

02:05:31.690 --> 02:05:33.525
IT IS CONTRARY TO THE GOALS OF

02:05:33.592 --> 02:05:35.327
OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND I WOULD

02:05:35.394 --> 02:05:37.396
ALSO ARGUE THAT IT LEADS TO LESS

02:05:37.463 --> 02:05:38.497
SAFE COMMUNITIES. SO, SENATOR, I

02:05:38.564 --> 02:05:40.099
THINK THIS IS A GREAT MEASURE

02:05:40.165 --> 02:05:42.334
I'M PROUD TO RECOMMEND AND I AND

02:05:42.401 --> 02:05:43.402
SHOULD IT GET OUT OF COMMITTEE

02:05:43.469 --> 02:05:45.771
TODAY, I'D BE HAPPY TO JUMP ON

02:05:45.838 --> 02:05:47.206
AS A COAUTHOR WITH YOU. YES, I

02:05:47.273 --> 02:05:49.041
WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU AS A

02:05:49.108 --> 02:05:51.477
COAUTHOR. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR.

02:05:51.543 --> 02:05:52.111
THANK YOU SENATOR. WITH THAT,

02:05:52.177 --> 02:05:52.711
COLLEAGUES, IT DOES REQUIRE A

02:05:52.778 --> 02:05:54.780
MOTION. IS THERE A MOTION? ALL

02:05:54.847 --> 02:05:56.415
RIGHT. WE HAVE A MOTION BY

02:05:56.482 --> 02:05:57.283

THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SENATOR.
