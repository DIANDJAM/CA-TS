SB 477 SENATOR BLAKE SPEER.

00:39:11.082 --> 00:39:14.385
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. WELL

THANK YOU CHAIR. HELLO, MEMBERS.

00:39:16.253 --> 00:39:20.758
GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU FOR THE

00:39:20.825 --> 00:39:23.661
OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SB 477.

00:39:23.728 --> 00:39:25.396
THIS BILL WOULD CLARIFY LANGUAGE

00:39:25.463 --> 00:39:26.831
IN THE CALIFORNIA FAIR

00:39:26.897 --> 00:39:28.632
EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT OR

00:39:28.699 --> 00:39:31.569
FIFA. SORRY FOR SO THAT THE

00:39:31.635 --> 00:39:32.970
CIVIL RIGHTS DEPARTMENT CAN MORE

00:39:33.037 --> 00:39:34.438
EFFECTIVELY INVESTIGATE AND

00:39:34.505 --> 00:39:35.806
PROSECUTE DISCRIMINATION,

00:39:35.873 --> 00:39:36.340
HARASSMENT AND OTHER CIVIL

00:39:36.407 --> 00:39:39.543
RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. SINCE IT WAS

00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:42.213
ENACTED IN 1959, FIFA HAS

00:39:42.279 --> 00:39:43.647
PROTECTED CALIFORNIANS FROM

00:39:43.714 --> 00:39:44.749
WORKPLACE AND HOUSING

00:39:44.815 --> 00:39:46.083
DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:48.419
BASED ON VARIOUS PROTECTED

00:39:48.486 --> 00:39:49.787
CHARACTERISTICS. THESE INCLUDE

00:39:49.854 --> 00:39:52.123
RACE, RELIGION, DISABILITY,

00:39:52.189 --> 00:39:53.724
GENDER, REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH,

00:39:53.791 --> 00:39:55.926
DECISION MAKING, AND VETERAN

00:39:55.993 --> 00:39:58.763
STATUS UNDER THE CIVIL RIGHTS

00:39:58.829 --> 00:40:01.065
DEPARTMENT, OR CRT, INVESTIGATES

00:40:01.132 --> 00:40:02.366
THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS EVERY

00:40:02.433 --> 00:40:03.801
YEAR. HOWEVER, CURRENT LAW

00:40:03.868 --> 00:40:05.336
CREATES CHALLENGES, INCLUDING

00:40:05.402 --> 00:40:07.438
STRICT DEADLINES TO COMPLETE AN

00:40:07.505 --> 00:40:08.506
INVESTIGATION EVEN WHEN ALL

00:40:08.572 --> 00:40:10.441
PARTIES AGREE THAT MORE TIME IS

00:40:10.508 --> 00:40:12.176
NEEDED. FEDERAL AND STATE LAW

00:40:12.243 --> 00:40:13.644
ALSO USE DIFFERENT TERMS TO

00:40:13.711 --> 00:40:15.045
DESCRIBE CASES IN WHICH

00:40:15.112 --> 00:40:16.747
DISCRIMINATION HAPPENS TO MORE

00:40:16.814 --> 00:40:17.982
THAN ONE PERSON. TO BETTER

00:40:18.048 --> 00:40:19.784
PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF OUR FELLOW

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:21.185
CALIFORNIANS, CRT MUST BE

00:40:21.252 --> 00:40:22.520
EMPOWERED TO WORK AS EFFICIENTLY

00:40:22.586 --> 00:40:25.055
AS POSSIBLE. SB 477 WOULD

00:40:25.122 --> 00:40:26.924
RESOLVE ADMINISTRATIVE

00:40:26.991 --> 00:40:28.993
INEFFICIENCIES AND STATUTORY

00:40:29.059 --> 00:40:31.262
INCONSISTENCIES BY ALLOWING CRT

00:40:31.328 --> 00:40:32.429
TO TOLL DEADLINES WHEN THE

00:40:32.496 --> 00:40:34.865
PARTIES ALL AGREE, UPDATING THE

00:40:34.932 --> 00:40:36.534
DEFINITION OF QUOTE GROUP OR

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.769
CLASS COMPLAINTS, AND EXTENDING

00:40:38.836 --> 00:40:40.604
THE DEADLINE FOR A COMPLAINANT

00:40:40.671 --> 00:40:42.406
TO FILE A CASE IN COURT DURING

00:40:42.473 --> 00:40:44.909
CRDS APPEAL PROCESS, CRT

00:40:44.975 --> 00:40:45.876
BELIEVES THESE CHANGES WOULD

00:40:45.943 --> 00:40:47.745
HAVE A POSITIVE FISCAL IMPACT,

00:40:47.812 --> 00:40:49.280
ULTIMATELY SAVING TAXPAYERS

00:40:49.346 --> 00:40:50.648
MONEY AND STRENGTHENING OUR

00:40:50.714 --> 00:40:51.715
COMMITMENT TO CALIFORNIA'S

00:40:51.782 --> 00:40:53.184
VALUES. AND WITH THAT, I

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:54.251
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

00:40:54.318 --> 00:40:58.022
AND I HAVE NO WITNESSES. THANK

00:40:58.088 --> 00:41:01.492
YOU. HAVE A MOTION. OH, WAIT A

00:41:01.559 --> 00:41:04.261
NEVERMIND. I TAKE MY MOTION.

00:41:04.328 --> 00:41:06.197
THERE'S A MOTION ON THE TABLE TO

00:41:06.263 --> 00:41:09.366
TABLE. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE HERE

00:41:09.433 --> 00:41:12.436
IN SUPPORT OF SB 477? ANYONE

00:41:12.503 --> 00:41:15.506
HERE IN OPPOSITION TO SB 477?

00:41:15.573 --> 00:41:18.976
ANYONE HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB

00:41:19.043 --> 00:41:20.177
477? ANYONE HERE IN OPPOSITION

00:41:20.244 --> 00:41:22.646
TO SB 477? ANY QUESTIONS OR

00:41:22.713 --> 00:41:25.549
COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS? MADAM

00:41:25.616 --> 00:41:27.318
VICE CHAIR, THANK YOU, MR.

00:41:27.384 --> 00:41:31.789
CHAIR. THIS BILL PROPOSES TO

00:41:31.856 --> 00:41:33.791
UPSET OR UPEND LONG STANDING

00:41:33.858 --> 00:41:36.160
PRACTICE WHERE A LEGAL MATTER

00:41:36.227 --> 00:41:37.862
WOULD BE RESOLVED IN THE

00:41:37.928 --> 00:41:39.530
RESIDENCY OF WHERE THE ACTION IS

00:41:39.597 --> 00:41:41.365
TAKING PLACE. AND SO THIS WOULD

00:41:41.432 --> 00:41:43.934
CREATE A AN INCONVENIENCE, I

00:41:44.001 --> 00:41:45.736
GUESS, AT THE MOST TO BE IN

00:41:45.803 --> 00:41:47.037
DIFFERENT DISTRICTS. AND THE

00:41:47.104 --> 00:41:49.273
PARTIES ARE NOT IN THEIR LOCAL

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:52.009
LOCALE, DISTRICT OR THE NEAREST

00:41:52.076 --> 00:41:52.576
LOCATION FOR THEM. COULD YOU

00:41:52.643 --> 00:41:55.713
EXPLAIN THAT? I DON'T THINK WE

00:41:55.779 --> 00:41:57.548
PERCEIVE THAT TO BE A PROBLEM

00:41:57.615 --> 00:41:59.416
THAT'S CREATED BY THIS BILL. I

00:41:59.483 --> 00:42:01.452
MEAN, THESE ARE THESE ARE CLEAN

00:42:01.518 --> 00:42:03.420
UP MEASURES THAT ARE SUPPORTED

00:42:03.487 --> 00:42:05.589
AND REQUESTED BY THE DEPARTMENT

00:42:05.656 --> 00:42:08.726
THAT'S MANAGING THESE. SO WELL.

00:42:08.792 --> 00:42:11.262
THE DEPARTMENT VERSUS THE

00:42:11.328 --> 00:42:13.464
SUBJECTS OF THE ACTION. I MEAN,

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:15.266
WHO'S CONVENIENCE ARE WE TALKING

00:42:15.332 --> 00:42:17.835
ABOUT? RIGHT. WELL, IT'S FOR

00:42:17.902 --> 00:42:21.572
BOTH. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. MY

00:42:21.639 --> 00:42:23.173
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THAT THE

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:24.608
CURRENT PRACTICE IS THAT, THAT

00:42:24.675 --> 00:42:26.577
YOU RESOLVE THESE LEGAL MATTERS

00:42:26.644 --> 00:42:28.245
IN THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH YOU

00:42:28.312 --> 00:42:29.914
RESIDE. SO THIS WOULD CHANGE

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:34.151
THAT. IS THAT CORRECT? IT DOES

00:42:34.218 --> 00:42:38.656
TO SOME DEGREE. OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

00:42:38.722 --> 00:42:43.694
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

00:42:43.761 --> 00:42:45.162

00:55:01.364 --> 00:55:03.033
GIVEN THE EVER CHANGING NATURE

00:55:10.573 --> 00:55:12.042
COMPLETELY CLEAR IN STATUTE AND

00:55:12.108 --> 00:55:13.543
REAFFIRM CALIFORNIA'S

00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:14.644

ADOPTION PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:18.214
CONFIRMATORY ADOPTIONS. IN CASES

00:55:18.281 --> 00:55:19.649
WHERE THE FAMILIES NO LONGER

00:55:19.716 --> 00:55:21.851
LIVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA, THEY

00:55:21.918 --> 00:55:23.520
MOVED, BUT THE INDIVIDUAL THE

00:55:23.586 --> 00:55:25.288
CHILD THAT IS BEING ADOPTED WAS

00:55:25.355 --> 00:55:27.957
BORN IN CALIFORNIA. WITH RECENT

00:55:28.024 --> 00:55:29.726
AMENDMENTS, THIS BILL WILL ALSO

00:55:29.793 --> 00:55:31.661
REQUIRE ALL LEGAL PARENTS TO BE

00:55:31.728 --> 00:55:33.329
LISTED ON THE ADOPTION ORDER TO

00:55:33.396 --> 00:55:35.098
ENSURE THERE IS NO CONFUSION IN

00:55:35.165 --> 00:55:36.700
CASES WHERE AN EXISTING PARENT

00:55:36.766 --> 00:55:38.735
IS RETAINING THE PARENTAL RIGHT,

00:55:38.802 --> 00:55:40.170
BUT CONFIRMING THE PARENTAL

00:55:40.236 --> 00:55:42.005
RIGHT OF THEIR PARTNER, WHICH IS

00:55:42.072 --> 00:55:44.174
ESPECIALLY THE CASE IN

00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:45.942
CONFIRMATORY ADOPTIONS. THIS

00:55:46.009 --> 00:55:47.243
ENSURES THAT IF A FAMILY NEEDS

00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:48.945
TO MOVE OUT OF CALIFORNIA FOR

00:55:49.012 --> 00:55:50.280
WHATEVER REASON, NOW RESIDES IN

00:55:50.346 --> 00:55:51.648
A LESS SUPPORTIVE STATE, THE

00:55:51.715 --> 00:55:52.615
LEGAL PARENT CHILD RELATIONSHIPS

00:55:52.682 --> 00:55:53.917
ARE PROTECTED AND MITIGATES

00:55:53.983 --> 00:55:56.319
LEGAL UNCERTAINTY FOR FAMILIES

00:55:56.386 --> 00:55:57.620
HERE TO TESTIFY. MISTER CHAIR

00:55:57.687 --> 00:55:59.289
AND COLLEAGUES, I HAVE TWO

00:55:59.355 --> 00:56:00.824
WITNESSES ON BEHALF OF SB 450.

WITH YOUR PERMISSION, I'D LIKE

00:56:01.825 --> 00:56:03.793
TO NOW TURN OVER TO THEM. THANK

00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:05.762
YOU. WE'LL START WITH CRAIG.

00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:07.263
GOOD MORNING, CRAIG PAULSON, ON

00:56:07.330 --> 00:56:08.264
BEHALF OF EQUALITY CALIFORNIA,

00:56:08.331 --> 00:56:09.899
PROUD CO-SPONSOR. LIKE THE

00:56:09.966 --> 00:56:11.534
SENATOR SAID, THIS BILL SIMPLY

00:56:11.601 --> 00:56:13.036
CLARIFIES AND REAFFIRMS

00:56:13.103 --> 00:56:14.003
CALIFORNIA'S LONGSTANDING

00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:15.538
JURISDICTION OVER ADOPTION

00:56:15.605 --> 00:56:16.339
PROCEEDINGS FOR ALL FAMILIES

00:56:16.406 --> 00:56:17.707
WHOSE CHILDREN WERE BORN IN THE

00:56:17.774 --> 00:56:19.576
STATE, EVEN IF THEY NO LONGER

00:56:19.642 --> 00:56:20.844
LIVE HERE. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL

00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:22.679
YEARS, AS MANY OF YOU KNOW,

00:56:22.746 --> 00:56:24.481
WE'VE WITNESSED GROWING ATTACKS

00:56:24.547 --> 00:56:25.048
ON THE LEGAL RIGHTS OF LGBTQ

00:56:25.115 --> 00:56:26.616
PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY, AND

00:56:26.683 --> 00:56:28.451
MANY PARENTS ARE UNDERSTANDABLY

00:56:28.518 --> 00:56:29.486
CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THESE

00:56:29.552 --> 00:56:30.920
THREATS WILL IMPACT THEIR

00:56:30.987 --> 00:56:32.388
FAMILIES. ONE OF THE MOST

00:56:32.455 --> 00:56:34.190
IMPORTANT THING LGBTQ PARENTS IN

00:56:34.257 --> 00:56:35.892
PARTICULAR, CAN DO TO PROTECT

00:56:35.959 --> 00:56:37.193
THEIR FAMILIES IS TO SECURE A

00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:38.628
COURT ORDERED ADOPTION DECREE,

00:56:38.695 --> 00:56:40.330
WHICH MUST BE RECOGNIZED IN ALL

00:56:40.396 --> 00:56:42.499
50 STATES. THIS ENSURES THAT IF,

00:56:42.565 --> 00:56:43.867
FOR WHATEVER REASON, THE FAMILY

00:56:43.933 --> 00:56:45.034
RELOCATES TO ANOTHER STATE,

00:56:45.101 --> 00:56:46.503
THEIR LEGAL RELATIONSHIP WITH

00:56:46.569 --> 00:56:48.238
THEIR CHILD WILL REMAIN

00:56:48.304 --> 00:56:49.639
PROTECTED. UNFORTUNATELY,

00:56:49.706 --> 00:56:50.907
THERE'S CURRENTLY A LACK OF

00:56:50.974 --> 00:56:51.875
CLARITY UNDER EXISTING LAWS TO

00:56:51.941 --> 00:56:54.310
WHETHER LGBTQ PARENTS CAN ACCESS

00:56:54.377 --> 00:56:55.745
THE STATE STREAMLINED

00:56:55.812 --> 00:56:57.313
CONFIRMATORY ADOPTIONS PROCESS

00:56:57.380 --> 00:57:00.517
IF THEIR CHILD WAS BORN IN

00:57:00.583 --> 00:57:03.787
CALIFORNIA BUT THEY NO LONGER

00:57:03.853 --> 00:57:04.254
RESIDE HERE. AND THIS

00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:04.921
STREAMLINED PROCESS IS IMPORTANT

00:57:04.988 --> 00:57:05.488
BECAUSE IT ALLOWS SAME SEX

00:57:05.555 --> 00:57:06.222
COUPLES TO SECURE LEGAL

00:57:06.289 --> 00:57:08.424
RECOGNITION OF PARENTAGE WITHOUT

00:57:08.491 --> 00:57:10.627
REQUIRING HOME STUDIES OR OTHER

00:57:10.693 --> 00:57:12.762
UNNECESSARY BARRIERS. SO SB 450

00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:14.497
IS A STRAIGHTFORWARD MEASURE. IT

00:57:14.564 --> 00:57:16.699
SIMPLY AMENDS THE FAMILY CODE TO

00:57:16.766 --> 00:57:18.067
CLARIFY CALIFORNIA'S

00:57:18.134 --> 00:57:19.135

00:57:19.202 --> 00:57:21.304
PROCEEDINGS. AND IMPORTANTLY,

00:57:21.371 --> 00:57:23.139
THIS BILL WILL NOT AFFECT THE

00:57:23.206 --> 00:57:24.941

CUSTODY JURISDICTION AND

00:57:31.481 --> 00:57:32.882
ENFORCEMENT ACT. THIS IS AN

00:57:32.949 --> 00:57:33.917
IMPORTANT MEASURE TO PROTECT

00:57:33.983 --> 00:57:35.718
CALIFORNIA FAMILIES AND

00:57:35.785 --> 00:57:37.220
RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE.

AND ASSISTED REPRODUCTION

00:57:47.597 --> 00:57:49.365
TECHNOLOGY LAWYERS. THIS IS AN

00:57:49.432 --> 00:57:50.533
ORGANIZATION THAT PROVIDES

00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:52.202

ADOPTION, ASSISTED REPRODUCTION,

00:57:54.537 --> 00:57:56.239
GUARDIANSHIP, AND FOSTER CARE,

00:57:56.306 --> 00:57:58.441
AN IMPORTANT PROTECTION FOR

00:57:58.508 --> 00:58:00.243
LGBTQ FAMILIES IS THE ABILITY TO

00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:02.011
SECURE THIS COURT ORDERED

00:58:02.078 --> 00:58:03.446

AND AGAIN, BECAUSE OF THE

00:58:11.721 --> 00:58:12.755
CHANGING NATIONAL CLIMATE,

00:58:12.822 --> 00:58:14.190
PARENTS ARE INCREASINGLY

00:58:14.257 --> 00:58:16.025
CONCERNED WHEN THEY MOVE OUT OF

00:58:16.092 --> 00:58:17.093
CALIFORNIA. BUT THEIR CHILD WAS

00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:19.095
BORN HERE. CALIFORNIA COURTS

00:58:19.162 --> 00:58:20.330
HAVE BEEN EXERCISING

00:58:20.396 --> 00:58:22.832
JURISDICTION OVER THESE CASES

00:58:22.899 --> 00:58:25.468
HISTORICALLY, AND SB 450 SIMPLY

00:58:25.535 --> 00:58:28.671
AMENDS THAT CURRENT PRACTICE OF

UNNECESSARY LEGAL BARRIERS, AND

00:58:36.613 --> 00:58:38.681

COAUTHOR. I JUST WANT TO THANK

00:59:30.233 --> 00:59:31.501
THE AUTHOR. I MEAN, ONE OF THE

00:59:31.567 --> 00:59:34.103
THINGS THAT THE AUTHOR HAS DONE

00:59:34.170 --> 00:59:35.238
HAS BEEN REALLY FOCUSED A LOT OF

00:59:35.305 --> 00:59:37.006
ATTENTION ON MAKING SURE THAT

00:59:37.073 --> 00:59:38.141
ALL FAMILIES ARE PROTECTED AND

00:59:38.207 --> 00:59:40.576
HAVE THE RIGHTS THAT THEY HAVE

00:59:40.643 --> 00:59:42.845
TO DO THE THINGS THAT ALL

00:59:42.912 --> 00:59:43.880
PARENTS DO WITH THEIR KIDS,

00:59:43.947 --> 00:59:45.615
RIGHT. WHICH IS BEING ABLE TO

00:59:45.682 --> 00:59:47.417
LOVE THEM, PROVIDE FOR THEM,

00:59:47.483 --> 00:59:49.319
KEEP THEM TOGETHER, AND HAVE THE

00:59:49.385 --> 00:59:51.521
RIGHTS THAT THEY NEED. AND, YOU

00:59:51.587 --> 00:59:53.222
KNOW, I THINK A FEW YEARS AGO

00:59:53.289 --> 00:59:54.958
WHEN I WAS AT EQUALITY

00:59:55.024 --> 00:59:56.459
CALIFORNIA, WE WERE ALWAYS

00:59:56.526 --> 01:00:02.999
FOCUSED ON HOW DO WE. PRESERVE

01:00:03.066 --> 01:00:05.735
RIGHTS IN, IN A MUCH LESS

01:00:05.802 --> 01:00:08.738
HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT. BUT TODAY

01:00:08.805 --> 01:00:11.641
WE KNOW THAT WE DON'T HAVE SORT

01:00:11.708 --> 01:00:13.776
OF JUST A LACK OF RIGHTS IN SOME

01:00:13.843 --> 01:00:15.578
STATES. IT'S NOT SORT OF A

01:00:15.645 --> 01:00:16.679
NEUTRAL PLAYING FIELD. WE

01:00:16.746 --> 01:00:18.848
ACTUALLY HAVE ABSOLUTE HOSTILITY

01:00:18.915 --> 01:00:20.283
TO LGBTQ FAMILIES IN MANY

01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:22.552
STATES. AND SO IT REALLY IS

01:00:22.618 --> 01:00:23.886
IMPORTANT THAT THERE IS A FORUM

01:00:23.953 --> 01:00:26.356
WHERE PARENTS CAN ACTUALLY

01:00:26.422 --> 01:00:28.291
AFFIRM THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS FOR

01:00:28.358 --> 01:00:30.326
THEIR KIDS. AND THESE KIDS HAVE

01:00:30.393 --> 01:00:32.128
A NEXUS TO CALIFORNIA. THEY WERE

01:00:32.195 --> 01:00:34.964
BORN HERE. AND IT'S SOMETHING

01:00:35.031 --> 01:00:38.234
THAT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT THING

01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:40.837
FOR LGBTQ FAMILIES AND THE AND

01:00:40.903 --> 01:00:42.672
OUR KIDS. SO I JUST WANT TO

01:00:42.739 --> 01:00:44.407
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:46.142
STRONGLY IN SUPPORT, AND I WANT

01:00:46.209 --> 01:00:47.610
TO THANK THE BILL SPONSORS AS

01:00:47.677 --> 01:00:50.113
WELL. THANK YOU. MEMBER.

01:00:50.179 --> 01:00:52.315
ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAUER-KAHAN.

01:00:52.382 --> 01:00:54.083
THANK YOU. I JUST WANT TO CONCUR

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:55.885
WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA

01:00:55.952 --> 01:00:58.087
MONICA AND THANK THE AUTHOR OF

01:00:58.154 --> 01:00:59.822
THIS. MY SISTER HAD HER CHILDREN

01:00:59.889 --> 01:01:01.724
IN A FOREIGN STATE. SHE AND HER

01:01:01.791 --> 01:01:03.493
WIFE HAD TO GO THROUGH THE

01:01:03.559 --> 01:01:05.661
PROCESS OF THE HOME VISITS, THE

01:01:05.728 --> 01:01:08.131
LONG ADOPTION COURT PROCESS, AND

01:01:08.197 --> 01:01:10.566
IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST PAINFUL

01:01:10.633 --> 01:01:12.802
THINGS TO WATCH. TWO MOTHERS,

01:01:12.869 --> 01:01:14.270
THE ONLY MOTHERS THESE GIRLS HAD

01:01:14.337 --> 01:01:16.339
EVER KNOWN, SO LOVING, SO

01:01:16.406 --> 01:01:18.574
WONDERFUL, AND YET BEING

01:01:18.641 --> 01:01:19.642
INSPECTED AND QUESTIONED IN A

01:01:19.709 --> 01:01:21.878
WAY THAT NO STRAY PARENTS WOULD

01:01:21.944 --> 01:01:23.913
EVER EXPERIENCE. AND THE

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:25.848
INEQUALITY AND THE LACK OF

01:01:25.915 --> 01:01:28.518
HUMANITY IN THAT PROCESS WAS SO

01:01:28.584 --> 01:01:30.620
DIFFICULT. AND I THINK YOU'RE

01:01:30.686 --> 01:01:31.754
REALLY DOING SOMETHING

01:01:31.821 --> 01:01:33.556
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. THEY WERE

01:01:33.623 --> 01:01:35.658
MY NIECES WERE BOTH ADOPTED, AND

01:01:35.725 --> 01:01:36.559
NOW THEY'RE BOTH THEIR LEGAL

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:39.695
PARENTS. BUT THE FACT THAT THAT

01:01:39.762 --> 01:01:40.797
WAS EVEN A QUESTION IS SOMETHING

01:01:40.863 --> 01:01:42.298
THAT SHOULD NEVER BE. AND SO I

01:01:42.365 --> 01:01:43.866
THINK THAT THIS IS SO CRITICALLY

01:01:43.933 --> 01:01:45.101
IMPORTANT, AND I'M SO GRATEFUL

01:01:45.168 --> 01:01:46.335
YOU'RE DOING IT SO THAT

01:01:46.402 --> 01:01:47.470
EVERYBODY CAN HAVE TWO LOVING

01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:48.838
PARENTS, JUST LIKE MY NIECES

01:01:48.905 --> 01:01:50.173
WITHOUT THAT PROCESS. AND I WILL

01:01:50.239 --> 01:01:52.475
SAY TO THE CREDIT OF A LOT OF

01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:54.243
THE SOCIAL WORKERS WHO HAD TO DO

01:01:54.310 --> 01:01:55.311
IT, THEY WOULD APOLOGIZE. BUT IT

01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:57.613
WAS WHAT THE LAW DEMANDED. AND

01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:59.182

PRESENTING YOUR BILL. I WAS

THE OTHER HOUSE AND SHARING

01:02:34.817 --> 01:02:36.052
PERSONAL STORIES. I THINK THIS

01:02:36.119 --> 01:02:37.920
IS REALLY IMPACTFUL. IF OTHER

01:02:37.987 --> 01:02:39.522

GOOD MORNING, CHAIR AND MEMBERS.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OF COURSE,

01:14:02.104 --> 01:14:04.940
I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT SB 683,

01:14:05.007 --> 01:14:06.675
WHICH STRENGTHENS STRENGTHENS

01:14:06.742 --> 01:14:07.843
PROTECTIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO

01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:09.645
HAVE HAD THEIR NAME, IMAGE OR

01:14:09.711 --> 01:14:12.114
LIKENESS USURPED. I'LL BE

01:14:12.181 --> 01:14:13.182

01:14:13.248 --> 01:14:14.616
AMENDMENTS AS OUTLINED ON PAGE

01:14:14.683 --> 01:14:16.418
SIX OF THE ANALYSIS, AND I

01:14:16.485 --> 01:14:17.386
REALLY WANT TO THANK THE

01:14:17.452 --> 01:14:20.756
COMMITTEE STAFF FOR YOUR WORK ON

01:14:20.823 --> 01:14:21.857
THIS. IT'S BEEN A JOY WORKING

01:14:21.924 --> 01:14:24.426
WITH THE COMMITTEE ON SOMETHING

01:14:24.493 --> 01:14:26.762
LIKE THIS THAT IS REALLY ABOUT

01:14:26.829 --> 01:14:29.031
LEGAL REMEDIES. EXISTING LAW

01:14:29.097 --> 01:14:30.465
PROHIBITS THE UNAUTHORIZED USE

01:14:30.532 --> 01:14:32.267
OF ANOTHER'S NAME, VOICE,

01:14:32.334 --> 01:14:33.702
SIGNATURE, PHOTOGRAPH, OR

01:14:33.769 --> 01:14:35.504
LIKENESS IN ANY MANNER WITHOUT

01:14:35.571 --> 01:14:38.106
CONSENT. YET WE CONTINUE TO SEE

01:14:38.173 --> 01:14:39.842
PREVALENT MISUSE. AND I SHOULD

01:14:39.908 --> 01:14:42.978
NOTE THAT LAW HAS BEEN AROUND

01:14:43.045 --> 01:14:45.614
FOR NEARLY FOUR DECADES. THE

01:14:45.681 --> 01:14:46.748
EXPLOITATION OF ONE'S LIKENESS

01:14:46.815 --> 01:14:47.916
CAN HAVE SERIOUS SOCIAL, MENTAL,

01:14:47.983 --> 01:14:49.484
AND ECONOMIC RAMIFICATIONS,

01:14:49.551 --> 01:14:51.019
GIVEN THE INCREASING

01:14:51.086 --> 01:14:52.487
SOPHISTICATION OF ADVERTISING,

01:14:52.554 --> 01:14:53.655
IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT THE LAW

01:14:53.722 --> 01:14:55.390
PROVIDE IMMEDIATE INDIVIDUAL

01:14:55.457 --> 01:14:57.226
PROTECTION WITH THIS BILL. DOES

01:14:57.292 --> 01:14:59.328
IS IT CLARIFIES THAT AN

01:14:59.394 --> 01:15:00.762
INDIVIDUAL SEEKING RELIEF FOR

01:15:00.829 --> 01:15:02.030
VIOLATION MAY SEEK AN INJUNCTION

01:15:02.097 --> 01:15:03.899
OR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER.

01:15:03.966 --> 01:15:06.435
ORDER, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS A

01:15:06.501 --> 01:15:09.338
TRO, SO THE TRO BE GRANTED. THE

01:15:09.404 --> 01:15:11.273
RESPONDENT MUST COMPLY WITHIN

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:12.307
TWO BUSINESS DAYS FROM THE DATE

01:15:12.374 --> 01:15:13.809
THE ORDER IS SERVED, UNLESS

01:15:13.876 --> 01:15:16.245
OTHERWISE SPECIFIED, SO IT COULD

01:15:16.311 --> 01:15:18.747
BE SOONER. THIS STATUTE HAS NOT

01:15:18.814 --> 01:15:21.383
BEEN UPDATED IN OVER 40 YEARS.

01:15:21.450 --> 01:15:24.519
AS I ALLUDED, THE ORIGINAL

01:15:24.586 --> 01:15:25.888
INTENT STILL STANDS TRUE. OUR

01:15:25.954 --> 01:15:27.456
LAWS MUST PROVIDE PROTECTION

01:15:27.522 --> 01:15:29.892
FROM INVASION OF PRIVACY. NOT

01:15:29.958 --> 01:15:31.727
ONLY ARE CONSUMERS MISLED,

01:15:31.793 --> 01:15:33.328
MISLED BY UNAUTHORIZED MATERIAL,

01:15:33.395 --> 01:15:35.297
BUT THE PERSON DEPICTED CAN LOSE

01:15:35.364 --> 01:15:36.632
COMPENSATION, CAREER

01:15:36.698 --> 01:15:37.833
OPPORTUNITIES AND POTENTIALLY

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:39.268
THEIR REPUTATION. AS I THINK WE

01:15:39.334 --> 01:15:41.436
ALL KNOW. THANK YOU AND I

01:15:41.503 --> 01:15:43.272
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

01:15:43.338 --> 01:15:45.874
THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE

01:15:45.941 --> 01:15:53.382

01:16:09.932 --> 01:16:11.266

IN TERMS OF OUR CONCERNS ABOUT

01:16:23.912 --> 01:16:26.081
THE FIRST AMENDMENT, BUT I'M

THE BILL CAN BE IMPROVED WITH

01:16:53.942 --> 01:16:55.210
CLARIFYING LANGUAGE TO STATE

COALITION IN OPPOSITION, WANT TO

THANK THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF

CONFUSED BY THIS BILL ON THE ONE

01:17:46.028 --> 01:17:48.163
HAND. SO WHAT WHAT MPA IS

01:17:48.230 --> 01:17:50.032
ARGUING IS THAT SECTION CIVIL

01:17:50.098 --> 01:17:53.168
CODE, SECTION 527 ALREADY

01:17:53.235 --> 01:17:54.603

ADDITIONAL INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

01:18:04.713 --> 01:18:06.448

PROBLEM YOU'RE TRYING TO

01:18:08.784 --> 01:18:12.154

01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:14.189
UNDERLYING ISSUE ABOUT MAKING

01:18:14.256 --> 01:18:16.191

ON ONE HAND, IF INJUNCTIVE

01:18:23.765 --> 01:18:25.267
RELIEF IS ALREADY AVAILABLE, WHY

01:18:25.333 --> 01:18:27.736
ARE WE ADDING A SECOND KIND OF

01:18:27.803 --> 01:18:28.703
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF? IT DIDN'T

01:18:28.770 --> 01:18:31.306
LOOK TO ME LIKE, OTHER THAN THE

01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:33.775
TWO DAY PERIOD OF TIME, THAT IT

01:18:33.842 --> 01:18:34.910
WOULD BE DIFFERENT FROM ANY

01:18:34.976 --> 01:18:36.478
OTHER INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER

01:18:36.545 --> 01:18:39.247
THE GENERAL STATUTE. AND THEN I

01:18:39.314 --> 01:18:41.783
GUESS THE SECOND QUESTION IS WHY

01:18:41.850 --> 01:18:45.387
THE TWO DAYS AS WELL? IN SOME

01:18:45.454 --> 01:18:47.189
CASES, IT SEEMS LIKE YOU MIGHT

01:18:47.255 --> 01:18:48.223
WANT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. THAT

01:18:48.290 --> 01:18:49.858
WOULD I MEAN, WHY WOULD YOU TAKE

01:18:49.925 --> 01:18:51.059
THE DISCRETION OF THE COURT

01:18:51.126 --> 01:18:53.328
AWAY? I MEAN, IN SOME CASES YOU

01:18:53.395 --> 01:18:54.596
SHOULD IT SHOULD BE IMMEDIATE.

01:18:54.663 --> 01:18:55.497
SOMETIMES SOME CASES IT MIGHT BE

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:59.334
MIGHT TAKE LONGER FOR AN ENTITY,

01:18:59.401 --> 01:19:00.836
A MOTION PICTURE PRODUCER, TO

01:19:00.902 --> 01:19:03.171
ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING THAT IS TO

01:19:03.238 --> 01:19:05.507
COMPLY WITH THE LAW. SO I'M

01:19:05.574 --> 01:19:06.441
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. SO I DON'T

01:19:06.508 --> 01:19:08.043
KNOW IF YOU CAN RESPOND TO IT.

01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:10.212
SURE I CAN. FIRST OF ALL, YOU

01:19:10.278 --> 01:19:11.413
KNOW, A CLOSE READING OF THE

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:13.815
BILL WILL INDICATE THAT THE 48

01:19:13.882 --> 01:19:15.684
HOURS IS A DEFAULT AND IT'S 48

01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:17.719
HOURS OR SOONER. SO THERE'S NO

01:19:17.786 --> 01:19:19.121
JUDICIAL DISCRETION TAKEN AWAY.

01:19:19.187 --> 01:19:22.023
IF A JUDGE ORDERS IMMEDIATE

01:19:22.090 --> 01:19:23.425
TAKEDOWN. AND THAT'S WHAT

01:19:23.492 --> 01:19:26.661
HAPPENS. WE THERE'S NOTHING IN

01:19:26.728 --> 01:19:28.163
THIS GOING TO THE OTHER

01:19:28.230 --> 01:19:29.231
QUESTION. THERE'S NOTHING IN

01:19:29.297 --> 01:19:32.200
THIS IN THIS BILL THAT ATTEMPTS

01:19:32.267 --> 01:19:34.636
TO ALTER 3344 IN ANY WAY, SHAPE

01:19:34.703 --> 01:19:36.805
OR FORM. SO THERE'S NO FIRST

01:19:36.872 --> 01:19:37.606
AMENDMENT ISSUES THAT WE'RE

01:19:37.672 --> 01:19:39.474
CREATING. IT'S A REMEDY, BILL.

01:19:39.541 --> 01:19:40.775
AND TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION

01:19:40.842 --> 01:19:43.378
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHY? WHY DRAG

01:19:43.445 --> 01:19:49.117
THE 527 SECTION, YOU KNOW, INTO

01:19:49.184 --> 01:19:51.219
3344 TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT A TRO

01:19:51.286 --> 01:19:53.722
IS AVAILABLE IS JUST TO MAKE IT

01:19:53.788 --> 01:19:54.956
CLEAR THAT A TRO IS AVAILABLE.

01:19:55.023 --> 01:19:56.892
SO, TO BE VERY CANDID, YOU KNOW,

01:19:56.958 --> 01:19:59.861
THE BILL DOESN'T DO A LOT IN

01:19:59.928 --> 01:20:01.263
TERMS OF ADDING REMEDIES, BUT I

01:20:01.329 --> 01:20:04.933
THINK IT CREATES A CLEAR ROADMAP

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.434
FOR IN THIS CASE, WHAT WOULD BE

01:20:06.501 --> 01:20:09.404
PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL TO WHO AS, AS

01:20:09.471 --> 01:20:10.605
YOU KNOW, AS AN ATTORNEY AS I

01:20:10.672 --> 01:20:12.641
KNOW, AS AN ATTORNEY, MAYBE

01:20:12.707 --> 01:20:14.276
SHEPARDIZING MAYBE KEYWORD

01:20:14.342 --> 01:20:16.111
SEARCHING AND LOOKING FOR AN

01:20:16.178 --> 01:20:18.680
OPPORTUNITY TO, YOU KNOW, FOR

01:20:18.747 --> 01:20:21.583
SOME KIND OF RAPID TAKEDOWN OF,

01:20:21.650 --> 01:20:24.486
OF MATERIAL. AND, YOU KNOW, THIS

01:20:24.553 --> 01:20:26.888
IS REALLY GOING TO JUST ALLOW

01:20:26.955 --> 01:20:30.492
VERY CLEARLY FOR, YOU KNOW,

01:20:30.559 --> 01:20:33.028
COUNSEL TO IN EFFECT, IT KIND OF

01:20:33.094 --> 01:20:34.629
CREATES A SHORTCUT FOR THEM TO

01:20:34.696 --> 01:20:36.264
SEE VERY CLEARLY THAT NOT ONLY

01:20:36.331 --> 01:20:37.399
DO THEY HAVE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

01:20:37.465 --> 01:20:40.168
AVAILABLE, BUT THAT 527 REMEDIES

01:20:40.235 --> 01:20:42.037
ARE AVAILABLE, THAT A TRO IS

01:20:42.103 --> 01:20:44.172
AVAILABLE. AND IF THEY'RE IN A

01:20:44.239 --> 01:20:46.007
REAL HURRY AND THEY'RE

01:20:46.074 --> 01:20:47.142
FORTUNATE, THEY MIGHT GET THE

01:20:47.209 --> 01:20:49.211
JUDGE TO TAKE IT DOWN EVEN

01:20:49.277 --> 01:20:51.546
SOONER. BUT WE WANTED TO MAKE

01:20:51.613 --> 01:20:53.548
SURE THERE WAS A 48 HOUR DEFAULT

01:20:53.615 --> 01:20:56.084
SO THAT IT THERE WASN'T

01:20:56.151 --> 01:20:57.652
AMBIGUITY. ONCE A TRO WAS ISSUED

01:20:57.719 --> 01:21:01.756
AS TO HOW MUCH TIME A RESPONDENT

01:21:01.823 --> 01:21:03.992
HAS, YOU KNOW, TO ACTUALLY

01:21:04.059 --> 01:21:05.360
COMPLY, WHICH WOULD JUST

01:21:05.427 --> 01:21:06.861
OBVIOUSLY, AGAIN, AS YOU KNOW,

01:21:06.928 --> 01:21:08.597
RESULT IN ANOTHER LONG MOTION

01:21:08.663 --> 01:21:11.032
HEARING AND, YOU KNOW, AND A LOT

01:21:11.099 --> 01:21:12.601
MORE BICKERING, IT'S REALLY JUST

01:21:12.667 --> 01:21:15.937
A CLARIFYING BILL. SO WHAT HAVE

01:21:16.004 --> 01:21:21.977
YOU HAD EXAMPLES OF COURTS

01:21:22.043 --> 01:21:22.644
REFUSING TO ISSUE INJUNCTIONS IN

01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:28.817
THIS AREA. WE HAVE I'M NOT GOING

01:21:28.883 --> 01:21:31.987
TO CITE ANY EXAMPLES, YOU KNOW,

01:21:32.053 --> 01:21:36.324
TODAY OF THAT HAPPENING. BUT

01:21:36.391 --> 01:21:39.327
AGAIN, YOU KNOW, I THINK, YOU

01:21:39.394 --> 01:21:40.762
KNOW, I'M NOT PUTTING THIS AT

01:21:40.829 --> 01:21:42.097
YOUR DOORSTEP, BUT I THINK

01:21:42.163 --> 01:21:43.765
OPPOSITION IS KIND OF TRYING TO

01:21:43.832 --> 01:21:45.700
HAVE IT BOTH WAYS, SAYING, LOOK,

01:21:45.767 --> 01:21:47.202
THIS BILL DOESN'T DO A LOT IN

01:21:47.269 --> 01:21:48.436
TERMS OF CHANGING THE REMEDIES,

01:21:48.503 --> 01:21:50.372
BUT WE'RE OPPOSED BECAUSE YOU'RE

01:21:50.438 --> 01:21:51.840
EMBEDDING THE REMEDIES IN THE

01:21:51.906 --> 01:21:54.709
BILL. SO AT THE END OF THE DAY,

01:21:54.776 --> 01:21:55.443
WHAT'S THE IMBALANCE HERE?

01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:57.812
WHAT'S THE CONCERN HERE? I MEAN,

01:21:57.879 --> 01:21:59.648
I'M TOTALLY CONFUSED. I'M I'M

01:21:59.714 --> 01:22:01.182
TOTALLY CONFUSED ABOUT THE BILL

01:22:01.249 --> 01:22:03.418
BECAUSE ON ONE HAND, WHY DO WE

01:22:03.485 --> 01:22:05.553
NEED IT IF YOU ALREADY HAVE

01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:06.554
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AVAILABLE? ON

01:22:06.621 --> 01:22:08.757
THE OTHER HAND, WHY IS THERE A

01:22:08.823 --> 01:22:09.791
PROBLEM WITH HAVING INJUNCTIVE

01:22:09.858 --> 01:22:12.360
RELIEF IN THIS AREA UNLESS IT'S

01:22:12.427 --> 01:22:13.428
DIFFERENT SOMEHOW? AND THE

01:22:13.495 --> 01:22:15.630
THINGS THAT I SEE ARE THE TWO

01:22:15.697 --> 01:22:18.600
DAY ISSUE. AND I CAN SEE MAYBE

01:22:18.667 --> 01:22:21.403
WITH MPA THAT YOU MIGHT THERE

01:22:21.469 --> 01:22:22.771
MAY BE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE A

01:22:22.837 --> 01:22:25.807
JUDGE MAY WANT TO GIVE LONGER

01:22:25.874 --> 01:22:26.741
THAN TWO DAYS. SO I'M JUST

01:22:26.808 --> 01:22:28.209
COMPLETELY CONFUSED ABOUT WHY WE

01:22:28.276 --> 01:22:30.145
NEED THE BILL, BUT ALSO WHY

01:22:30.211 --> 01:22:34.249
THERE'S OPPOSITION TO THE BILL.

01:22:34.316 --> 01:22:35.383
THERE SHOULDN'T BE OPPOSITION TO

01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:37.485
THE BILL UNLESS, YOU KNOW, MPAS

01:22:37.552 --> 01:22:39.387
REALLY JOCKEYING FOR, YOU KNOW,

01:22:39.454 --> 01:22:40.855
A CARVE OUT. FRANKLY, I'LL JUST

01:22:40.922 --> 01:22:43.658
BE VERY CANDID. IN A CLOSE

01:22:43.725 --> 01:22:45.560
READING OF THEIR OPPOSITION

01:22:45.627 --> 01:22:47.529
LETTER REALLY KIND OF INDICATES,

01:22:47.595 --> 01:22:49.130
HEY, THIS THIS BILL ON THE ONE

01:22:49.197 --> 01:22:51.566
HAND, DOESN'T DO A LOT IN TERMS

01:22:51.633 --> 01:22:52.634
OF CHANGING REMEDIES. SO WHY ARE

01:22:52.701 --> 01:22:55.170
WE DOING IT? ON THE OTHER HAND,

01:22:55.236 --> 01:22:58.139
OUR, YOU KNOW, OUR INDUSTRY IS,

01:22:58.206 --> 01:23:00.141
YOU KNOW, CONCERNED. AND, YOU

01:23:00.208 --> 01:23:02.043
KNOW, THOSE ARE KIND OF CODE

01:23:02.110 --> 01:23:04.312
WORDS FOR WHY DON'T YOU TRY TO

01:23:04.379 --> 01:23:06.481
HELP OUR INDUSTRY. SO WE'RE,

01:23:06.548 --> 01:23:07.482
WE'RE WE'RE TALKING TO THEM.

01:23:07.549 --> 01:23:09.384
WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM AS MUCH

01:23:09.451 --> 01:23:10.952
AS WE CAN GET RESPONSES BACK IN

01:23:11.019 --> 01:23:12.087
TERMS OF WHAT AMENDMENT, YOU

01:23:12.153 --> 01:23:13.588
KNOW, WE'VE ALL BEEN THROUGH

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:14.222
THIS, BUT WHAT AMENDMENT WOULD

01:23:14.289 --> 01:23:16.491
YOU LIKE? I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING

01:23:16.558 --> 01:23:17.625
LIKE THAT ON THE TABLE. AND

01:23:17.692 --> 01:23:18.960
WE'RE HAPPY WITH THE BILL THE

01:23:19.027 --> 01:23:20.328
WAY IT IS. SO UNTIL, YOU KNOW,

01:23:20.395 --> 01:23:22.030
WE CAN OPPOSITION TO PUT

01:23:22.097 --> 01:23:23.131
SOMETHING ON THE TABLE IN TERMS

01:23:23.198 --> 01:23:24.766
OF A PROPOSED AMENDMENT, YOU

01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:26.167
KNOW, WE'RE KIND OF GOING TO BE

01:23:26.234 --> 01:23:28.470
IN THIS, YOU KNOW, IN THIS NO

01:23:28.536 --> 01:23:30.972
MAN'S LAND, NO PERSON'S LAND

01:23:31.039 --> 01:23:33.775
THAT YOU AND I ARE IN RIGHT NOW.

01:23:33.842 --> 01:23:35.810
MR. CHAIRMAN, MAY I ASK FOR THE

01:23:35.877 --> 01:23:37.045
OPPOSITION WITNESS TO COME BACK

01:23:37.112 --> 01:23:40.415
UP AND ASK A QUESTION? SURE.

01:23:40.482 --> 01:23:42.584
THEY WANT TO COME BACK IF THEY

01:23:42.650 --> 01:23:46.254
WANT TO. YEAH. OPPOSITION. HAVE

01:23:46.321 --> 01:23:48.690
ANY COMMENTS? I THINK SENATOR

01:23:48.757 --> 01:23:49.824
ROSENBERG WANTS TO ASK A

01:23:49.891 --> 01:23:53.828
QUESTION AS WELL. MAY I, MR.

01:23:53.895 --> 01:23:55.163
ZIPPER? YES. I'M NOT PREPARED

01:23:55.230 --> 01:23:57.031
TODAY TO TAKE ON THE FIRST

01:23:57.098 --> 01:23:57.832
AMENDMENT CONCERNS AT THE MOTION

01:23:57.899 --> 01:23:59.734
PICTURE ASSOCIATION, HAS IT, BUT

01:23:59.801 --> 01:24:01.636
WE ARE HAPPY TO CONTINUE THE

01:24:01.703 --> 01:24:03.438
CONVERSATION. AND FORTUNATELY,

01:24:03.505 --> 01:24:07.041
TODAY WE'LL REST ON THE MEMO

01:24:07.108 --> 01:24:09.010
ONLY IN OUR POSITION. I SHOULD

01:24:09.077 --> 01:24:11.679
CLARIFY THAT THIS 3344 APPLIES

01:24:11.746 --> 01:24:14.215
ONLY TO COMMERCIAL, COMMERCIAL.

01:24:14.282 --> 01:24:17.152
SPEECH. COMMERCIAL PUBLICATIONS.

01:24:17.218 --> 01:24:20.088
SO AGAIN, WE NEED TO GET TO

01:24:20.155 --> 01:24:21.489
WHERE AND WHEN. I'M NOT SAYING

01:24:21.556 --> 01:24:23.158
IT DOESN'T EXIST. YOU KNOW, IN

01:24:23.224 --> 01:24:24.526
THE INDUSTRY THAT THE OPPOSITION

01:24:24.592 --> 01:24:25.760
IS REPRESENTING. BUT WE NEED TO

01:24:25.827 --> 01:24:27.595
HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT SO WE CAN

01:24:27.662 --> 01:24:29.431
SEE IF THERE'S SOMETHING WE CAN

01:24:29.497 --> 01:24:31.132
DO ABOUT IT IN THE BILL. BUT

01:24:31.199 --> 01:24:31.900
YOU'RE YOU'RE COMMITTED TO

01:24:31.966 --> 01:24:34.102
WORKING WITH THEM IF THEY COME

01:24:34.169 --> 01:24:34.969
UP WITH PROPOSED AMENDMENTS.

01:24:35.036 --> 01:24:35.603
ABSOLUTELY. WE'VE WE'VE ALREADY

01:24:35.670 --> 01:24:37.005
STARTED AND I REALLY APPRECIATE

01:24:37.071 --> 01:24:37.572
THEIR RESPECTFUL APPROACH

01:24:37.639 --> 01:24:39.174
BECAUSE I THINK THEY'VE COME IN

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:40.141
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT WE'VE

01:24:40.208 --> 01:24:41.676
ALREADY, YOU KNOW, BEGUN THE

01:24:41.743 --> 01:24:42.844
DIALOG AND IT'S BEEN SERIOUS.

01:24:42.911 --> 01:24:44.312
AND I'VE YOU KNOW, WE HAVE OUR

01:24:44.379 --> 01:24:46.414
BEST PEOPLE ON IT IN THE OFFICE.

01:24:46.481 --> 01:24:48.183
YEAH. I MEAN, THE ONLY REASON

01:24:48.249 --> 01:24:49.517
I'M SAYING THIS IS THE LAST

01:24:49.584 --> 01:24:51.052
THING I'LL SAY IS, YOU KNOW,

01:24:51.119 --> 01:24:53.087
JUST SORT OF CONFUSED ABOUT THE

01:24:53.154 --> 01:24:54.489
BILL. IT JUST ON ONE HAND, IT

01:24:54.556 --> 01:24:55.690
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT DOES VERY

01:24:55.757 --> 01:24:57.058
MUCH OTHER THAN SOME OF THESE

01:24:57.125 --> 01:24:58.293
LIMITATIONS. SO I DON'T

01:24:58.359 --> 01:25:00.595
UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S NEEDED. ON

01:25:00.662 --> 01:25:01.429
THE OTHER HAND, I DON'T

01:25:01.496 --> 01:25:01.896
UNDERSTAND WHY THERE'S

01:25:01.963 --> 01:25:03.231
OPPOSITION TO IT, BUT I DO SORT

01:25:03.298 --> 01:25:05.166
OF CARE ABOUT FOR ME, WHEN YOU

01:25:05.233 --> 01:25:07.101
ARE REDUCING DISCRETION OF THE

01:25:07.168 --> 01:25:09.370
JUDGE, I TEND TO BE NERVOUS

01:25:09.437 --> 01:25:12.841
ABOUT IT BECAUSE IN SOME CASES

01:25:12.907 --> 01:25:14.609
AND IN IN FACT, IF IT'S, YOU

01:25:14.676 --> 01:25:17.679
KNOW, HARMING A MAJOR INDUSTRY

01:25:17.745 --> 01:25:20.415
IN MY AREA, I CARE ABOUT MAKING

01:25:20.482 --> 01:25:22.984
SURE THAT THAT WE DON'T DO

01:25:23.051 --> 01:25:24.719
SOMETHING THAT'S INADVERTENTLY

01:25:24.786 --> 01:25:25.954
HARMFUL. THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY

01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:26.788
NEEDED. BUT I'LL SUPPORT THE

01:25:26.855 --> 01:25:29.123
BILL TODAY, GIVEN THE COMMITMENT

01:25:29.190 --> 01:25:30.592
THAT YOU'LL CONTINUE WORKING

01:25:30.658 --> 01:25:33.528
WITH THEM IF THEY COME UP WITH

01:25:33.595 --> 01:25:34.629
PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. SO THANK

01:25:34.696 --> 01:25:37.232
YOU, SENATOR BAUER. KHN. THANK

01:25:37.298 --> 01:25:38.600
YOU, MR. CHAIR. AND THANK YOU,

01:25:38.666 --> 01:25:40.201
SENATOR. AND I'M JUST HAPPY THAT

01:25:40.268 --> 01:25:42.136
I'M NOT THE ONLY SUBJECT OF MP'S

01:25:42.203 --> 01:25:43.705
IRE IN THIS SPACE. SO THERE WE

01:25:43.771 --> 01:25:46.741
GO. THAT'S MY HAPPINESS ON THIS

01:25:46.808 --> 01:25:49.410
BILL. SO I DO SHARE SOME OF THE

01:25:49.477 --> 01:25:50.745
CONCERNS OF MY COLLEAGUE, IN

01:25:50.812 --> 01:25:52.514
PART BECAUSE I THINK THAT IN THE

01:25:52.580 --> 01:25:53.648
COMMERCIAL SETTING, IT WOULD BE

01:25:53.715 --> 01:25:54.883
INCREDIBLY HARD TO SHOW

01:25:54.949 --> 01:25:56.184
IRREPARABLE HARM. I MEAN, I

01:25:56.251 --> 01:25:58.353
THINK THAT YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO

01:25:58.419 --> 01:25:59.554
GET DAMAGES FOR THAT SUCH THAT A

01:25:59.621 --> 01:26:01.489
COURT IS NOT LIKELY TO GRANT A

01:26:01.556 --> 01:26:04.826
TRO IN THIS SETTING. AND SO I, I

01:26:04.893 --> 01:26:07.595
HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS. ONE IS,

01:26:07.662 --> 01:26:08.763
YOU KNOW, I THINK IT IS

01:26:08.830 --> 01:26:09.898
APPROPRIATE FOR THIS COMMITTEE

01:26:09.964 --> 01:26:11.566
TO BE DEALING WITH THE FIRST

01:26:11.633 --> 01:26:12.567
AMENDMENT ISSUES, THIS BEING THE

01:26:12.634 --> 01:26:15.236
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. SO I AM

01:26:15.303 --> 01:26:17.639
WONDERING IF WE CAN TRY TO FLESH

01:26:17.705 --> 01:26:18.273
THOSE OUT A LITTLE BIT. AND I'M

01:26:18.339 --> 01:26:20.008
WONDERING IF THE FIRST AMENDMENT

01:26:20.074 --> 01:26:21.776
COALITION WANTS TO COME UP AND

01:26:21.843 --> 01:26:23.211
WEIGH IN TO EXPAND ON THAT, IF

01:26:23.278 --> 01:26:25.680
THAT'S OKAY WITH THE CHAIR. IF

01:26:25.747 --> 01:26:28.449
THEY IF THEY HAVE FEEDBACK THAT

01:26:28.516 --> 01:26:31.886
THEY'D LIKE TO OFFER TO YOUR

01:26:31.953 --> 01:26:35.356
COMMENT. SURE. YEAH. I WILL SAY

01:26:35.423 --> 01:26:38.626
AGAIN THAT I DO APPRECIATE THE

01:26:38.693 --> 01:26:39.661
CONVERSATION THAT WE'VE HAD WITH

01:26:39.727 --> 01:26:42.230
THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE. WE DON'T

01:26:42.297 --> 01:26:44.766
WE'RE NOT OPENLY OPPOSED TO THE

01:26:44.832 --> 01:26:46.634
BILL. I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, AS

01:26:46.701 --> 01:26:48.369
OTHERS HAVE SAID, IF I CAN

01:26:48.436 --> 01:26:50.505
REFERENCE THE LETTER, YOU KNOW,

01:26:50.572 --> 01:26:54.342
THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE HERE

01:26:54.409 --> 01:26:55.977
WOULD BE THE ALLOWING OF A

01:26:56.044 --> 01:26:57.378
PLAINTIFF TO SEEK A TEMPORARY

01:26:57.445 --> 01:26:58.680
RESTRAINING ORDER OR PRELIMINARY

01:26:58.746 --> 01:26:59.881
INJUNCTION TO COMPEL THE

01:26:59.948 --> 01:27:02.817
TAKEDOWN OF A NAME OR LIKENESS

01:27:02.884 --> 01:27:04.919
ON THE ALLEGATION THAT THE

01:27:04.986 --> 01:27:06.788
PUBLICATION IS FOR IMPROPER

01:27:06.854 --> 01:27:11.092
COMMERCIAL USE. WE WE'RE NOT

01:27:11.159 --> 01:27:12.794
OUTRIGHT OPPOSED TO THE BILL,

01:27:12.860 --> 01:27:16.064
BUT DO THINK THAT THE BILL IS

01:27:16.130 --> 01:27:17.699
FUNDAMENTALLY NOT NOT REALLY

01:27:17.765 --> 01:27:18.900
MOVING THE BALL FORWARD. I'LL

01:27:18.967 --> 01:27:21.502
SAY THAT. YEAH. SO THAT'S A

01:27:21.569 --> 01:27:23.638
CONCERN SO THAT IT IS A CONCERN.

01:27:23.705 --> 01:27:26.541
THANK YOU. SO GIVEN THAT I MEAN

01:27:26.608 --> 01:27:31.212
I THINK. AGAIN THIS IS

01:27:31.279 --> 01:27:34.849
COMMERCIAL SPEECH AND I THINK IT

01:27:34.916 --> 01:27:36.250
IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT THE

01:27:36.317 --> 01:27:37.952
COURT HAS DISCRETION. SO I WANT

01:27:38.019 --> 01:27:39.020
TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THAT

01:27:39.087 --> 01:27:40.688
AMENDMENT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S

01:27:40.755 --> 01:27:41.422
REALLY IMPORTANT. MY MAIN

01:27:41.489 --> 01:27:42.256
CONCERN WAS ACTUALLY SETTING A

01:27:42.323 --> 01:27:43.358
PRECEDENT WHERE WE SET A

01:27:43.424 --> 01:27:44.425
TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER

01:27:44.492 --> 01:27:46.361
COULD GO FOR 48 HOURS, BECAUSE

01:27:46.427 --> 01:27:47.095
WHERE YOU'RE SHOWING IRREPARABLE

01:27:47.161 --> 01:27:49.664
HARM, 48 HOURS CAN BE A VERY

01:27:49.731 --> 01:27:50.932
LONG TIME. AND MOST HEROES ARE

01:27:50.999 --> 01:27:52.734
IMMEDIATE FOR A REASON. I THINK

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:54.602
WE'RE IN A SETTING WHERE, YOU

01:27:54.669 --> 01:27:56.437
KNOW, OBVIOUSLY TECHNOLOGY IS

01:27:56.504 --> 01:27:57.405
DIFFICULT. SO I THINK THAT'S WHY

01:27:57.472 --> 01:27:59.173
YOU'RE GIVING THEM A LITTLE MORE

01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:00.642
TIME. BUT I THINK THE JUDGE IS

01:28:00.708 --> 01:28:02.276
IN THE BEST POSITION TO DECIDE

01:28:02.343 --> 01:28:03.578
WHAT THE SOONEST POSSIBLE MOMENT

01:28:03.645 --> 01:28:05.446
IS, AND THAT'S WHAT THE JUDGE

01:28:05.513 --> 01:28:06.848
SHOULD, SHOULD DO IN A GIVEN. IF

01:28:06.914 --> 01:28:09.450
YOU'VE MET THIS STANDARD, THEN

01:28:09.517 --> 01:28:11.152
THE LAST QUESTION I HAD FOR YOU

01:28:11.219 --> 01:28:13.621
WAS MOST OF YOUR SUPPORT IS FROM

01:28:13.688 --> 01:28:15.423
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ORGANIZATIONS.

01:28:15.490 --> 01:28:17.025
THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING

01:28:17.091 --> 01:28:18.359
TO ME BECAUSE, AGAIN, COMMERCIAL

01:28:18.426 --> 01:28:20.495
SETTINGS ONLY FOR THIS BILL. SO

01:28:20.561 --> 01:28:22.897
I DO UNDERSTAND HOW DEEPFAKES

01:28:22.964 --> 01:28:27.368
CAN BE USED IN MANY WAYS TO

01:28:27.435 --> 01:28:29.237
HARASS, TO THREATEN IN A

01:28:29.303 --> 01:28:31.706
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SETTING. BUT

01:28:31.773 --> 01:28:33.474
IT SURPRISED ME THAT THAT WOULD

01:28:33.541 --> 01:28:34.609
BE TRUE UNDER THIS BILL WHERE

01:28:34.676 --> 01:28:36.511
IT'S COMMERCIAL IN NATURE. CAN

01:28:36.577 --> 01:28:38.246
YOU TOUCH ON THAT A LITTLE BIT?

01:28:38.312 --> 01:28:39.647
THE LETTERS DIDN'T. I THINK

01:28:39.714 --> 01:28:41.816
THERE CAN BE TRY THAT OUT. I

01:28:41.883 --> 01:28:44.719
THINK UNDER COMMERCIAL SPEECH OR

01:28:44.786 --> 01:28:46.821
PURE POLITICAL SPEECH OR ANY

01:28:46.888 --> 01:28:47.689
OTHER SPEECH THAT'S COVERED

01:28:47.755 --> 01:28:49.924
UNDER THE FIRST AMENDMENT, YOU

01:28:49.991 --> 01:28:51.559
CAN HAVE EXPLOITATION AS ONE OF

01:28:51.626 --> 01:28:53.294
THE TYPES OF EXPRESSION THAT

01:28:53.361 --> 01:28:55.096
OCCURS. AND I THINK DOMESTIC

01:28:55.163 --> 01:28:57.231
VIOLENCE ADVOCATES SEE THAT AND

01:28:57.298 --> 01:29:00.902
FEEL THAT. 3344 AGAIN, WHICH HAS

01:29:00.968 --> 01:29:02.670
BEEN AROUND SINCE JOHN

01:29:02.737 --> 01:29:03.705
VASCONCELLOS WAS HERE AND WROTE

01:29:03.771 --> 01:29:08.776
THE BILL IS A COMMERCIAL SPEECH

01:29:08.843 --> 01:29:12.714
BILL. SO I THINK MANY OF US IN

01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:13.347
THE LEGISLATURE ARE, YOU KNOW,

01:29:13.414 --> 01:29:15.516
TAKING I DON'T WANT TO SAY BABY

01:29:15.583 --> 01:29:17.351
STEPS, BUT THE STEPS THAT WE CAN

01:29:17.418 --> 01:29:19.320
TAKE TO MAKE SURE THAT REMEDIES

01:29:19.387 --> 01:29:21.656
ARE CLEAR AND ARE AS IMMEDIATE

01:29:21.723 --> 01:29:23.458
AS POSSIBLE. AGAIN, THIS AS YOU

01:29:23.524 --> 01:29:25.993
AS YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THIS BILL, IT

01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:27.895
REALLY CREATES A BACKSTOP AT 48

01:29:27.962 --> 01:29:31.099
HOURS, BUT DOESN'T PRECLUDE

01:29:31.165 --> 01:29:32.500
JUDICIAL DISCRETION ON THE SPEED

01:29:32.567 --> 01:29:34.969
OF THE REMEDY, THE TRO TRO. NOR

01:29:35.036 --> 01:29:37.238
DOES IT. AND I THINK THIS IS THE

01:29:37.305 --> 01:29:39.107
MOST IMPORTANT THING I'LL SAY IS

01:29:39.173 --> 01:29:40.641
IT TAKES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AWAY

01:29:40.708 --> 01:29:44.779
FROM FROM THE JUDGE IN TERMS OF

01:29:44.846 --> 01:29:47.648
MAKING THE BASELINE JUDGMENT AS

01:29:47.715 --> 01:29:50.151
TO WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A

01:29:50.218 --> 01:29:51.185
CONTENT ISSUES, FIRST AMENDMENT

01:29:51.252 --> 01:29:52.820
ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE PROTECTED

01:29:52.887 --> 01:29:53.821
OR NOT, WHETHER THERE'S IMMINENT

01:29:53.888 --> 01:29:57.391
HARM OR NOT. BUT I DON'T THINK

01:29:57.458 --> 01:29:58.893
IT'S HARD TO COME UP WITH

01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:01.329
EXAMPLES OF COMMERCIAL SPEECH.

01:30:01.395 --> 01:30:02.864
YOU KNOW, I THINK EVEN MAYBE

01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:06.367
MORE SO TODAY THAN 40 YEARS AGO,

01:30:06.434 --> 01:30:08.503
WHERE YOU HAVE IT IS COMMERCIAL

01:30:08.569 --> 01:30:09.971
SPEECH BECAUSE IT'S EMBEDDED

01:30:10.037 --> 01:30:11.839
WITH WITH PROMOTION, WITH

01:30:11.906 --> 01:30:13.441
ADVERTISING AND SO FORTH. AND,

01:30:13.508 --> 01:30:15.409
AND, YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY'S,

01:30:15.476 --> 01:30:18.212
SOMEBODY'S IMAGE IS AS PART OF

01:30:18.279 --> 01:30:22.183
THAT. I'M RELUCTANT TO GIVE

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:23.584
SPECIFIC EXAMPLES BECAUSE THE

01:30:23.651 --> 01:30:25.453
BILL IS NOT ABOUT ANY ONE

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:28.856
SPECIFIC EXAMPLE OR PLATFORM OR

01:30:28.923 --> 01:30:30.792
MEDIUM. BUT I MEAN, IT'S PRETTY.

01:30:30.858 --> 01:30:34.762
I SEE IT, YOU KNOW, I DO I DO

01:30:34.829 --> 01:30:36.964
TEN MINUTES OF LOOKING AT

01:30:37.031 --> 01:30:38.566
COMMERCIAL SPEECH JUST ABOUT

01:30:38.633 --> 01:30:41.269
EVERY NIGHT. AND YOU HAVE A LOT

01:30:41.335 --> 01:30:43.671
OF RESTRAINT, SENATOR. THAT'S A

01:30:43.738 --> 01:30:45.540
LOT OF RESTRAINT TO BE ON SOCIAL

01:30:45.606 --> 01:30:46.340
MEDIA FOR TEN MINUTES

01:30:46.407 --> 01:30:47.475
NECESSARILY. SOCIAL MEDIA, YOU

01:30:47.542 --> 01:30:49.677
KNOW, AS WE KNOW, ALL YOU HAVE

01:30:49.744 --> 01:30:50.745
TO DO IS TURN ON A STREAMING.

01:30:50.812 --> 01:30:52.880
BUT THIS THIS BILL DOESN'T YOU

01:30:52.947 --> 01:30:54.715
KNOW, IT'S NOT NECESSARILY ABOUT

01:30:54.782 --> 01:30:57.151
THAT OR ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT I

01:30:57.218 --> 01:30:58.619
SEE OR WHAT EXAMPLES I COULD

01:30:58.686 --> 01:31:01.155
COME UP WITH. I JUST THINK THE

01:31:01.222 --> 01:31:02.290
EXAMPLES ARE UBIQUITOUS AT THIS

01:31:02.356 --> 01:31:05.059
POINT. AND, AND, YOU KNOW,

01:31:05.126 --> 01:31:06.894
PLAINTIFFS AND PLAINTIFFS

01:31:06.961 --> 01:31:08.196
COUNSEL, I THINK WILL BE WELL

01:31:08.262 --> 01:31:09.730
SERVED, YOU KNOW, TO HAVE US, IN

01:31:09.797 --> 01:31:12.400
EFFECT, PUT A LITTLE BIT OF A

01:31:12.466 --> 01:31:14.402
MARQUEE UP IN 33, 44 AND SAY,

01:31:14.468 --> 01:31:17.705
YOU KNOW, A TRO IS AVAILABLE TO

01:31:17.772 --> 01:31:19.507
YOU UNDER THE RIGHT

01:31:19.574 --> 01:31:21.342
CIRCUMSTANCES. YOU DON'T NEED TO

01:31:21.409 --> 01:31:23.811
DO A LOT OF FURTHER RESEARCH OR

01:31:23.878 --> 01:31:24.579
SHEPARDIZING TRYING TO FIGURE

01:31:24.645 --> 01:31:27.548
OUT HOW TO GET TO A TRO. IF YOUR

01:31:27.615 --> 01:31:28.382
CLIENT, WHETHER THEY'RE FROM

01:31:28.449 --> 01:31:30.017
HOLLYWOOD OR ANYWHERE ELSE, YOU

01:31:30.084 --> 01:31:33.354
KNOW, HAS BEEN USURPED SIDE BY

01:31:33.421 --> 01:31:36.624
SIDE, YOU KNOW, WITH, YOU KNOW,

01:31:36.691 --> 01:31:38.960
WITH, WITH WITH, WITH, WITH WHAT

01:31:39.026 --> 01:31:39.760
OTHERWISE WOULD BE, YOU KNOW,

01:31:39.827 --> 01:31:41.696
SOME KIND OF MAINSTREAM

01:31:41.762 --> 01:31:42.563
ADVERTISING. OKAY. WELL, THANK

01:31:42.630 --> 01:31:43.931
YOU, SENATOR, FOR ANSWERING THE

01:31:43.998 --> 01:31:45.266
QUESTIONS. I SAW THOSE LETTERS

01:31:45.333 --> 01:31:48.569
AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK. I

01:31:48.636 --> 01:31:49.136
APPRECIATE IT. THANKS. AND I

01:31:49.203 --> 01:31:49.704
TAKE SERIOUSLY THE DOMESTIC

01:31:49.770 --> 01:31:51.739
VIOLENCE ADVOCATES, AND I THINK

01:31:51.806 --> 01:31:53.007
THIS NEW AGE OF TECHNOLOGY DOES

01:31:53.074 --> 01:31:55.142
MAKE SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC

01:31:55.209 --> 01:31:56.878
VIOLENCE MORE VULNERABLE. SO I

01:31:56.944 --> 01:31:57.712
WANTED TO ADDRESS THAT A LITTLE

01:31:57.778 --> 01:31:59.413
BIT, BUT APPRECIATE IT. I'LL BE

01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:01.883
SUPPORTING IT AS WELL, BECAUSE I

01:32:01.949 --> 01:32:02.984
CONCUR WITH MY COLLEAGUE THAT I

01:32:03.050 --> 01:32:04.585
THINK THIS IS ALREADY THE LAW. I

01:32:04.652 --> 01:32:06.320
THINK YOU'VE SAID THAT ACTUALLY,

01:32:06.387 --> 01:32:07.388
AND SAYING THAT YOU'RE JUST

01:32:07.455 --> 01:32:09.357
PUTTING UP A MARQUEE. AND I

01:32:09.423 --> 01:32:10.558
THINK THAT REMEDIES COURTS ARE

01:32:10.625 --> 01:32:12.360
BEST POISED TO DECIDE WHAT THE

01:32:12.426 --> 01:32:13.427
APPROPRIATE REMEDY IS, AND THIS

01:32:13.494 --> 01:32:16.130
IS ONE OF THEM. AND SO I THINK I

01:32:16.197 --> 01:32:16.697
DON'T SEE IT BEING APPLIED

01:32:16.764 --> 01:32:18.332
OFTEN, GIVEN THAT I THINK OFTEN

01:32:18.399 --> 01:32:19.500
BESIDES THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:32:19.567 --> 01:32:20.768
SETTING, PERHAPS, WHICH IS WHY I

01:32:20.835 --> 01:32:22.069
THOUGHT THOSE LETTERS WERE OF

01:32:22.136 --> 01:32:24.538
NOTE, THERE WOULD BE IRREPARABLE

01:32:24.605 --> 01:32:26.240
HARM. I THINK IN OTHER CASES YOU

01:32:26.307 --> 01:32:27.975
COULD JUST COMPENSATE THE

01:32:28.042 --> 01:32:29.310
INDIVIDUAL. SO WITH THAT, I

01:32:29.377 --> 01:32:30.845
DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BEEN MOVED,

01:32:30.912 --> 01:32:32.246
BUT I WOULD. IF NOT, I WOULD

01:32:32.313 --> 01:32:36.384
MOVE IT. MOTION. YES, WE HAVE A

01:32:36.450 --> 01:32:37.818
MOTION. IS THERE A SECOND. IS

01:32:37.885 --> 01:32:40.354
THERE A SECOND? I'LL SECOND.

01:32:40.421 --> 01:32:42.390
OKAY. WE HAVE A SECOND. AND

01:32:42.456 --> 01:32:43.891
BEFORE WE GO TO FURTHER COMMENTS

01:32:43.958 --> 01:32:45.359
I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT AS HAS

01:32:45.426 --> 01:32:46.994
BEEN INDICATED, THE AUTHOR DID

01:32:47.061 --> 01:32:48.329
ACCEPT AMENDMENTS TO GIVE THE

01:32:48.396 --> 01:32:49.730
COURTS JUDICIAL DISCRETION IF

01:32:49.797 --> 01:32:53.167
THEY DETERMINE THAT THE TRO

01:32:53.234 --> 01:32:54.702
NEEDS TO BE PUT IN PLACE

01:32:54.769 --> 01:32:55.937
IMMEDIATELY, THEY CAN DO SO.

01:32:56.003 --> 01:32:57.405
ALSO, I WOULD JUST NOTE ON PAGES

01:32:57.471 --> 01:32:59.573
FIVE AND SIX YOU'LL SEE THE

01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:01.309
EXCELLENT STAFF ANALYSIS. THE

01:33:01.375 --> 01:33:02.376
OPPOSITION CAME IN JUST A FEW

01:33:02.443 --> 01:33:04.612
DAYS AGO, SO THERE HASN'T BEEN

01:33:04.679 --> 01:33:06.414
MUCH TIME FOR THE AUTHOR TO

01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:07.281
ABSORB IT OR FOR WORK TOGETHER

01:33:07.348 --> 01:33:09.283
WITH OPPOSITION. BUT AS WE HEARD

01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:10.685
FROM OPPOSITION, THEY'RE ALL

01:33:10.751 --> 01:33:12.386
EAGER TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH

01:33:12.453 --> 01:33:14.188
THE SENATOR, WHICH IS GOOD.

01:33:14.255 --> 01:33:16.457
ASSEMBLY MEMBER PACHECO. YES.

01:33:16.524 --> 01:33:18.259
THANK YOU. I THINK I'M ON THE

01:33:18.326 --> 01:33:20.428
SAME PAGE AS MY COLLEAGUE.

01:33:20.494 --> 01:33:22.163
ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S A LITTLE

01:33:22.229 --> 01:33:25.866
CONFUSED AS TO THE OPPOSITION. I

01:33:25.933 --> 01:33:27.335
CAN UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE DOING

01:33:27.401 --> 01:33:28.736
IT. I KNOW THE COURTS ALREADY

01:33:28.803 --> 01:33:31.906
HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO TRO OR

01:33:31.973 --> 01:33:36.110
AN INJUNCTION. OR INJUNCTIVE

01:33:36.177 --> 01:33:40.915
RELIEF. SORRY, BUT I'M CURIOUS.

01:33:40.982 --> 01:33:43.184
MAYBE OPPOSITION COULD SAY IS

01:33:43.250 --> 01:33:46.687
ONE OF THE REASONS TO OPPOSE

01:33:46.754 --> 01:33:49.290
BECAUSE MORE TIME IS NEEDED. I

01:33:49.357 --> 01:33:50.691
WAS ACTUALLY READING THE MEMO

01:33:50.758 --> 01:33:53.160
RIGHT NOW AND SO IS MORE TIME

01:33:53.227 --> 01:33:55.730
NEEDED. I KNOW IN THE BILL

01:33:55.796 --> 01:33:58.933
CURRENTLY IT'S TWO DAYS AND

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:02.203
MOTION PICTURES, I DON'T KNOW. I

01:34:02.269 --> 01:34:05.106
KNOW WITH THE OTHER OPPOSITION

01:34:05.172 --> 01:34:06.941
IT'S YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE

01:34:07.008 --> 01:34:09.010
IMMEDIATE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. IS

01:34:09.076 --> 01:34:12.947
THAT WHAT IT IS? WITH THE

01:34:13.014 --> 01:34:14.749
CHAIRPERSON, TONY GONZALEZ, ON

01:34:14.815 --> 01:34:16.250
BEHALF OF THE RECORDING INDUSTRY

01:34:16.317 --> 01:34:17.351
ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA? FIRST, I

01:34:17.418 --> 01:34:18.786
HAVE TO APOLOGIZE. WE DID NOT

01:34:18.853 --> 01:34:20.187
SUBMIT A LETTER. WE'VE BEEN

01:34:20.254 --> 01:34:21.722
TRYING TO SECURE A MEETING WITH

01:34:21.789 --> 01:34:23.457
THE SENATOR FOR ABOUT A MONTH,

01:34:23.524 --> 01:34:24.558
AND THAT HASN'T HAPPENED YET.

01:34:24.625 --> 01:34:26.093
BUT HERE WE ARE TODAY. OUR

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:28.095
CONCERN REALLY IS JUST THAT THE

01:34:28.162 --> 01:34:30.531
TWO DAY DEFAULT IN THE STATUTE

01:34:30.598 --> 01:34:32.099
IS ADVERSE TO THE INTERESTS OF

01:34:32.166 --> 01:34:34.235
THE RIGHTSHOLDERS, AND THAT THE

01:34:34.301 --> 01:34:35.636
IF THE WORD IMMEDIATE IS

01:34:35.703 --> 01:34:37.238
OFFENSIVE, THAT WE WOULD BE

01:34:37.304 --> 01:34:39.206
HAPPY TO PROPOSE INSTEAD

01:34:39.273 --> 01:34:40.741
TECHNICALLY AND PRACTICALLY

01:34:40.808 --> 01:34:42.243
FEASIBLE, WHICH IS MY

01:34:42.309 --> 01:34:43.544
UNDERSTANDING, IS COMMON IN

01:34:43.611 --> 01:34:45.346
FEDERAL LAW IN THIS REGARD. OUR

01:34:45.413 --> 01:34:47.281
INTEREST IS IN SECURING THE

01:34:47.348 --> 01:34:48.983
PROTECTING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS

01:34:49.050 --> 01:34:52.319
RIGHTS. AND IF IT'S NOT

01:34:52.386 --> 01:34:53.654
TECHNICALLY AND PRACTICALLY

01:34:53.721 --> 01:34:55.689
FEASIBLE WITHIN THREE DAYS OR

01:34:55.756 --> 01:34:57.291
FIVE DAYS, AS DETERMINED BY

01:34:57.358 --> 01:34:59.360
COURT, FINE. BUT IF IT'S

01:34:59.427 --> 01:35:00.561
TECHNICALLY AND PRACTICALLY

01:35:00.628 --> 01:35:02.463
FEASIBLE IMMEDIATELY, THAT

01:35:02.530 --> 01:35:03.731
SHOULD BE THE STANDING ORDER. SO

01:35:03.798 --> 01:35:06.867
I UNDERSTAND THE FRAMEWORK OF

01:35:06.934 --> 01:35:09.170
THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE BILL.

01:35:09.236 --> 01:35:11.839
IMMEDIATE OR THAT THE COURT

01:35:11.906 --> 01:35:13.140
WOULD HAVE UP TO TWO DAYS OR

01:35:13.207 --> 01:35:15.276
GRANT UP TO TWO DAYS. BUT WE

01:35:15.342 --> 01:35:17.211
THINK THAT UP TO TWO DAYS WOULD

01:35:17.278 --> 01:35:19.013
BECOME THE DEFAULT AND WOULD BE

01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:20.081
ADVERSE TO THE INTEREST OF

01:35:20.147 --> 01:35:21.749
ARTISTS. AND, YOU KNOW, THE,

01:35:21.816 --> 01:35:22.817
THE, THE CELEBRATED

01:35:22.883 --> 01:35:24.318
CIRCUMSTANCES, WHETHER IT'S

01:35:24.385 --> 01:35:27.188
TAYLOR SWIFT HAVING HER IMAGE

01:35:27.254 --> 01:35:29.090
MISUSED FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES

01:35:29.156 --> 01:35:31.192
IN OFFENSIVE WAYS, OR SONGS

01:35:31.258 --> 01:35:33.694
BEING USED FOR POLITICAL

01:35:33.761 --> 01:35:34.695
CAMPAIGNS, AND I THINK WE'RE

01:35:34.762 --> 01:35:36.530
FAMILIAR WITH THAT, WHERE AN

01:35:36.597 --> 01:35:38.299
INJUNCTION WAS GRANTED AND WAS

01:35:38.365 --> 01:35:40.134
ENFORCED IMMEDIATELY, WE THINK

01:35:40.201 --> 01:35:42.002
THAT SHOULD BE THE DEFAULT. BUT

01:35:42.069 --> 01:35:43.604
IF I'M READING THE BILL

01:35:43.671 --> 01:35:45.473
CORRECTLY, IT SAYS THAT THE

01:35:45.539 --> 01:35:47.374
COURT CAN REQUIRE FASTER

01:35:47.441 --> 01:35:50.411
COMPLIANCE CAN, BUT UP TO TWO

01:35:50.478 --> 01:35:52.346
DAYS. AND WE'RE CONCERNED THAT

01:35:52.413 --> 01:35:53.714
UP TO TWO DAYS WOULD BE THE

01:35:53.781 --> 01:35:55.015
STANDING DEFAULT. AND WE'RE NOT

01:35:55.082 --> 01:35:57.118
SURE WHY. WHY TWO DAYS? WHY NOT

01:35:57.184 --> 01:35:58.119
TECHNICALLY AND PRACTICALLY

01:35:58.185 --> 01:35:59.787
FEASIBLE, WHICH COULD BE ONE

01:35:59.854 --> 01:36:02.323
MINUTE, ONE HOUR OR TEN DAYS.

01:36:02.389 --> 01:36:03.691
AND IN OUR WORLD THIS IS REALLY

01:36:03.757 --> 01:36:06.327
IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE, THE, THE

01:36:06.393 --> 01:36:09.196
STATUS OF SOME OF THESE ARTISTS

01:36:09.263 --> 01:36:11.165
AND WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH THEIR

01:36:11.232 --> 01:36:13.634
IMAGE OR THEIR SONGS IN THAT

01:36:13.701 --> 01:36:15.169
PERIOD OF TIME IN WHICH THEY'RE

01:36:15.236 --> 01:36:17.905
BEING MISAPPROPRIATED. OKAY. AND

01:36:17.972 --> 01:36:19.740
I'M CURIOUS TO HEAR FROM THE

01:36:19.807 --> 01:36:21.408
MOTION PICTURE ASSOCIATION

01:36:21.475 --> 01:36:23.844
WHETHER THE MOTION PICTURE

01:36:23.911 --> 01:36:25.579
ASSOCIATION ALSO AGREES WITH

01:36:25.646 --> 01:36:30.885
THESE COMMENTS. AGAIN, ASSEMBLY

01:36:30.951 --> 01:36:32.520
MEMBER, MY APOLOGIES. WE ARE

01:36:32.586 --> 01:36:33.787
HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS.

01:36:33.854 --> 01:36:35.823
WE'RE TRYING TO ALIGN OUR

01:36:35.890 --> 01:36:37.691
CONCERNS WITH SOME OF THE OTHER

01:36:37.758 --> 01:36:38.759
STAKEHOLDERS, AND I PROMISE THAT

01:36:38.826 --> 01:36:40.161
WE'RE EAGER TO HAVE THIS

01:36:40.227 --> 01:36:41.562
CONVERSATION, BUT I'M NOT

01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:43.464
PREPARED TODAY TO DO THAT. OKAY.

01:36:43.531 --> 01:36:45.299
WELL, THANK YOU FOR BRINGING

01:36:45.366 --> 01:36:46.667
THIS BILL FORWARD. I KNOW

01:36:46.734 --> 01:36:48.235
OPPOSITION CAME IN LATE, EVEN

01:36:48.302 --> 01:36:49.703
THOUGH YOU ALREADY MADE IT

01:36:49.770 --> 01:36:52.573
THROUGH THE SENATE. SO I'M

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:53.874
HOPEFUL THAT CONVERSATIONS WILL

01:36:53.941 --> 01:36:56.043
CONTINUE. I'M A LITTLE BAFFLED

01:36:56.110 --> 01:36:58.546
AS TO THE OPPOSITION. AND SO I

01:36:58.612 --> 01:37:00.281
AM SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY.

01:37:00.347 --> 01:37:05.920
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THANK YOU,

01:37:05.986 --> 01:37:08.489
MADAM VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU, MR.

01:37:08.556 --> 01:37:11.859
CHAIR. I'M KIND OF BAFFLED BY

01:37:11.926 --> 01:37:14.128
THIS DISCUSSION. HAVING SAT

01:37:14.195 --> 01:37:15.496
THROUGH MANY HEARINGS IN THE

01:37:15.563 --> 01:37:18.432
LAST YEAR ON PRIVACY AND MISUSE

01:37:18.499 --> 01:37:20.534
OF PERSONAL INFORMATION AND

01:37:20.601 --> 01:37:22.336
REMEDIES. RELATED TO THAT, I

01:37:22.403 --> 01:37:24.939
FIND THIS COMPELLINGLY POWERFUL

01:37:25.005 --> 01:37:26.674
BECAUSE IT'S SO SIMPLE. IF YOU

01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:29.276
HAVE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS

01:37:29.343 --> 01:37:31.979
AND YOU HAVE THE COLLEGE

01:37:32.046 --> 01:37:33.881
PLAYERS, ATHLETES INVOLVED,

01:37:33.948 --> 01:37:35.649
THERE'S A PROBLEM HERE

01:37:35.716 --> 01:37:37.451
SOMEWHERE. AND IF I UNDERSTAND

01:37:37.518 --> 01:37:40.387
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS JUST

01:37:40.454 --> 01:37:42.223
IF YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN

01:37:42.289 --> 01:37:43.357
INJUNCTION AND IF IT'S NOT A

01:37:43.424 --> 01:37:45.526
PERMANENT INJUNCTION, GIVE 20,

01:37:45.593 --> 01:37:46.527
48 HOURS TO JUST REVIEW AND SEE

01:37:46.594 --> 01:37:48.696
IF THERE'S MERIT TO THE PLEA. SO

01:37:48.762 --> 01:37:50.431
I THINK IT'S A SMART BILL,

01:37:50.497 --> 01:37:51.966
FRANKLY, BECAUSE IT IS SIMPLE

01:37:52.032 --> 01:37:54.368
AND STRAIGHTFORWARD. I AGREE, I

01:37:54.435 --> 01:37:57.171
DON'T KNOW WHAT WHY THE

01:37:57.238 --> 01:37:58.739
OPPOSITION WOULD BE OPPOSED, BUT

01:37:58.806 --> 01:38:00.808
I HAVING SEEN ALL THE

01:38:00.874 --> 01:38:03.711
COMPLEXITIES ON PLATFORMS AND

01:38:03.777 --> 01:38:06.313
ISSUES RELATED TO PLATFORMS AND

01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:07.815
ALL THE THINGS THAT WE'RE

01:38:07.881 --> 01:38:08.515
DEALING WITH IN PRIVACY AND

01:38:08.582 --> 01:38:10.217
THESE KINDS OF ISSUES, I THINK

01:38:10.284 --> 01:38:11.318
THIS IS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD. I

01:38:11.385 --> 01:38:13.487
WILL SUPPORT THE BILL. I'M JUST

01:38:13.554 --> 01:38:14.521
TRYING TO SEE LISTENING TO ALL

01:38:14.588 --> 01:38:16.690
THIS, WHAT DON'T I UNDERSTAND?

01:38:16.757 --> 01:38:19.126
BUT I THINK I DO. SO THANK YOU.

01:38:19.193 --> 01:38:20.494
I'LL BE SUPPORTING IT. THANK

01:38:20.561 --> 01:38:21.962
YOU. THANK YOU, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:38:22.029 --> 01:38:23.364
PEPIN I JUST THANK YOU FOR THE

01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:25.966
BILL. I JUST I TOO AM A LITTLE

01:38:26.033 --> 01:38:28.235
CONFUSED. HAS THERE BEEN

01:38:28.302 --> 01:38:29.069
TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDERS

01:38:29.136 --> 01:38:30.371
THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED? AND

01:38:30.437 --> 01:38:31.839
THERE'S BEEN A DEARTH OF

01:38:31.905 --> 01:38:33.007
SPECIFICITY OUT THERE? I CAN'T

01:38:33.073 --> 01:38:34.908
EVEN SAY IT, LET ALONE HAVE IT

01:38:34.975 --> 01:38:37.011
EXIST, BUT NONETHELESS, BECAUSE,

01:38:37.077 --> 01:38:38.579
YOU KNOW, USUALLY JUDGES ARE

01:38:38.646 --> 01:38:40.047
EXERCISING THEIR DISCRETION AND

01:38:40.114 --> 01:38:42.249
SAYING, THIS IS WHAT I THINK IS

01:38:42.316 --> 01:38:43.817
FAIR WITH WITH HOW YOU SHOULD

01:38:43.884 --> 01:38:45.953
COMPLY WITH IT. AND AGAIN, AS

01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:49.123
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE

01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:51.158
TO PLEAD FOR WHAT YOU WHAT YOU

01:38:51.225 --> 01:38:54.395
WANT. I MEAN, IT'S A RARE JUDGE

01:38:54.461 --> 01:38:56.330
THAT YOU GO INTO LAW IN MOTION

01:38:56.397 --> 01:38:58.565
WITH, WITH A GENERAL REQUEST FOR

01:38:58.632 --> 01:39:00.100
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF THAT, YOU

01:39:00.167 --> 01:39:03.570
KNOW, COMES BACK AND LANDS, YOU

01:39:03.637 --> 01:39:04.972
KNOW, RIGHTS, THE REMEDY FOR

01:39:05.039 --> 01:39:06.340
YOU. SO WE'RE JUST, AGAIN,

01:39:06.407 --> 01:39:08.876
TRYING TO TELEGRAPH TO FOLKS.

01:39:08.942 --> 01:39:10.678
WE'VE WE'VE I TELL YOU WHAT I

01:39:10.744 --> 01:39:13.747
HAVE HEARD, YOU KNOW, I IF I

01:39:13.814 --> 01:39:15.249
HAVE TO IN THIS COMMITTEE, I'LL

01:39:15.316 --> 01:39:16.450
GIVE THE NAME OF THE FAMILY. BUT

01:39:16.517 --> 01:39:18.385
I'VE HAD FAMILIES COME TO US

01:39:18.452 --> 01:39:19.520
FROM SANTA CLARA COUNTY, FROM

01:39:19.586 --> 01:39:21.955
THE CHAIR OF SAME COUNTY WHO

01:39:22.022 --> 01:39:25.192
HAVE LOST YOUNG PEOPLE AS YOUNG

01:39:25.259 --> 01:39:28.329
AS 15 YEARS OLD WHO HAVE SAID

01:39:28.395 --> 01:39:30.864
THE PROBLEM, WHAT CAUSED WHAT

01:39:30.931 --> 01:39:32.700
CAUSED THE SUICIDE, WHAT CAUSED

01:39:32.766 --> 01:39:33.367
THE SELF-INFLICTION IS WE

01:39:33.434 --> 01:39:34.702
COULDN'T GET IT DOWN RIGHT. WE

01:39:34.768 --> 01:39:37.071
COULDN'T GET IT DOWN. AND WHEN

01:39:37.137 --> 01:39:38.472
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN PUSH BACK ON

01:39:38.539 --> 01:39:40.240
THAT, LIKE WE'RE ALL DOING HERE

01:39:40.307 --> 01:39:41.508
AS ATTORNEYS AND SAY, WELL,

01:39:41.575 --> 01:39:42.276
PROBABLY YOU COULD HAVE GOTTEN

01:39:42.343 --> 01:39:44.378
IT DOWN HAD YOU HAD THE RIGHT

01:39:44.445 --> 01:39:46.613
ATTORNEY AND GONE IN FOR

01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:47.247
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ASKED FOR

01:39:47.314 --> 01:39:48.515
A 527 RELIEF. AND, YOU KNOW,

01:39:48.582 --> 01:39:49.850
SAID, I NEED THIS DOWN

01:39:49.917 --> 01:39:51.418
IMMEDIATELY. IT'S MY 15 YEAR OLD

01:39:51.485 --> 01:39:54.154
KID, YOU KNOW, BUT THE FACT THAT

01:39:54.221 --> 01:39:55.589
PEOPLE AREN'T FINDING THAT

01:39:55.656 --> 01:39:57.858
REMEDY AND DON'T KNOW IT EXISTS

01:39:57.925 --> 01:39:59.259
AND ARE SITTING THERE FLAILING,

01:39:59.326 --> 01:40:01.128
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT, CAN THE DA

01:40:01.195 --> 01:40:02.930
OR SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING ABOUT

01:40:02.996 --> 01:40:05.799
THIS WHEN THEY HAVE A PLAIN,

01:40:05.866 --> 01:40:07.034
SPECIFIC REMEDY AVAILABLE TO

01:40:07.101 --> 01:40:08.635
THEM UNDER 527? WE'RE JUST

01:40:08.702 --> 01:40:10.738
TRYING TO PUT THAT THERE IN THE

01:40:10.804 --> 01:40:12.239
BILL. ON THE COMMERCIAL SPEECH

01:40:12.306 --> 01:40:13.807
SIDE, AT LEAST, THAT, YOU KNOW,

01:40:13.874 --> 01:40:15.542
THAT WOULD PROTECT THEM IF IT

01:40:15.609 --> 01:40:18.045
WAS COMMERCIAL SPEECH AND, YOU

01:40:18.112 --> 01:40:20.547
KNOW, AND JUST NO MORE NO MORE

01:40:20.614 --> 01:40:21.915
GUESSING ABOUT WHAT'S AVAILABLE

01:40:21.982 --> 01:40:23.317
TO YOU. AND THEN THE QUESTION

01:40:23.384 --> 01:40:25.119
BECOMES, I THINK, YOU KNOW, IN

01:40:25.185 --> 01:40:27.020
TERMS OF OPPOSITION, I RESPECT

01:40:27.087 --> 01:40:29.189
THEIR INDUSTRY'S NOT THE SAME

01:40:29.256 --> 01:40:30.858
AS, AS EVERY FACT PATTERN THAT'S

01:40:30.924 --> 01:40:33.727
GOING TO COME UP. BUT YOU KNOW,

01:40:33.794 --> 01:40:37.097
HOW LONG IS TOO LONG, YOU KNOW,

01:40:37.164 --> 01:40:38.799
IN THOSE KIND OF CIRCUMSTANCES,

01:40:38.866 --> 01:40:41.001
YOU KNOW, WHERE A MINOR, FOR

01:40:41.068 --> 01:40:43.904
EXAMPLE, HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF

01:40:43.971 --> 01:40:46.373
WHAT WOULD BE, IN EFFECT, A 33,

01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:48.175
44 VIOLATION. SHOULD WE WAIT A

01:40:48.242 --> 01:40:50.344
WEEK TO TAKE THAT DOWN? WHAT IF

01:40:50.411 --> 01:40:52.913
IT'S ILLICIT? YOU KNOW, HOW LONG

01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:55.382
SHOULD WE LEAVE THAT UP? SO I

01:40:55.449 --> 01:40:57.551
THINK THE BILL STRIKES A BALANCE

01:40:57.618 --> 01:41:00.354
BETWEEN SAYING, LOOK, IN TODAY'S

01:41:00.421 --> 01:41:02.289
WORLD, IN TWO BUSINESS DAYS, YOU

01:41:02.356 --> 01:41:04.658
SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET IT DOWN. I

01:41:04.725 --> 01:41:05.492
HAVEN'T HEARD ANYBODY ACTUALLY

01:41:05.559 --> 01:41:08.128
SHOW US, YOU KNOW, LOGISTICALLY

01:41:08.195 --> 01:41:10.564
WHY THAT CAN'T HAPPEN. BUT IF

01:41:10.631 --> 01:41:13.033
SOMEONE CAN, YOU KNOW, IN, YOU

01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:14.668
KNOW, IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE

01:41:14.735 --> 01:41:16.637
WE'RE NOT DISRUPTING THE STREAM

01:41:16.703 --> 01:41:18.172
OF COMMERCE OR PRACTICALITY, WE

01:41:18.238 --> 01:41:20.441
SHOULD PROBABLY TAKE A LOOK AT

01:41:20.507 --> 01:41:21.575
THAT. THEY JUST NEED TO BE

01:41:21.642 --> 01:41:23.744
SPECIFIC AND SAY, YOU KNOW,

01:41:23.811 --> 01:41:26.747
WHERE DOES THAT OCCUR IN TODAY'S

01:41:26.814 --> 01:41:28.182
WORLD THAT YOU CAN'T SOMETHING

01:41:28.248 --> 01:41:30.384
THAT YOU PUT UP IN A MATTER OF

01:41:30.451 --> 01:41:31.385
SECONDS YOU CAN'T TAKE DOWN IN

01:41:31.452 --> 01:41:35.389
TWO BUSINESS DAYS. THANK YOU.

01:41:35.456 --> 01:41:38.859
ASSEMBLY MEMBERS OF BURR. SO

01:41:38.926 --> 01:41:40.561
SORRY TO BELABOR THIS. I'VE JUST

01:41:40.627 --> 01:41:42.262
BEEN LOOKING AT THE AT THE

01:41:42.329 --> 01:41:44.965
DOCUMENTS, I MEAN, I SO FIRST OF

01:41:45.032 --> 01:41:46.967
ALL, I THINK THE GENESIS OF THE

01:41:47.034 --> 01:41:48.068
BILL IS OBVIOUSLY WORTHWHILE. I

01:41:48.135 --> 01:41:50.037
MEAN, PEOPLE, PEOPLE, YOU KNOW,

01:41:50.103 --> 01:41:51.972
DO DEEPFAKES AND USING PEOPLE'S

01:41:52.039 --> 01:41:53.307
LIKENESSES, ESPECIALLY WITH

01:41:53.373 --> 01:41:55.175
KIDS, YOU KNOW, I UNDERSTAND WHY

01:41:55.242 --> 01:41:59.513
YOU WOULD WANT TO FLAG THE

01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:01.315
ABILITY TO SEEK INJUNCTIVE

01:42:01.381 --> 01:42:04.485
RELIEF. YOU KNOW, IN LOOKING AT

01:42:04.551 --> 01:42:07.688
THIS, THOUGH, YOU KNOW, I AM

01:42:07.754 --> 01:42:09.590
CONCERNED ABOUT THE TWO DAY

01:42:09.656 --> 01:42:11.692
PERIOD FROM BOTH BOTH SIDES. AND

01:42:11.758 --> 01:42:12.960
WE'VE GOT THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS

01:42:13.026 --> 01:42:14.595
WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT TWO DAYS

01:42:14.661 --> 01:42:15.829
BECOMING A PRESUMPTIVE AMOUNT OF

01:42:15.896 --> 01:42:17.798
TIME WHEN IT SHOULD BE SHORTER.

01:42:17.865 --> 01:42:20.000
I, I ASSUME THAT YOU'VE GOT THE

01:42:20.067 --> 01:42:22.202
MOTION PICTURE ASSOCIATION

01:42:22.269 --> 01:42:24.671
LOOKING AT AT LIMITING THE

01:42:24.738 --> 01:42:26.840
JUDGE'S DISCRETION, WHERE YOU

01:42:26.907 --> 01:42:29.076
MIGHT HAVE A TRO THAT BECOMES

01:42:29.142 --> 01:42:30.210
IMMEDIATE, BUT THE THINGS THAT

01:42:30.277 --> 01:42:31.512
ARE THEY'RE ORDERED TO DO MAY

01:42:31.578 --> 01:42:33.747
TAKE LONGER THAN TWO DAYS. AND

01:42:33.814 --> 01:42:35.682
SO I WOULD URGE YOU TO TRY TO

01:42:35.749 --> 01:42:36.617
CONFORM THIS TO THE NORMAL

01:42:36.683 --> 01:42:38.085
STANDARDS FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.

01:42:38.151 --> 01:42:40.220
AND THEN I'D JUST LIKE TO HAVE

01:42:40.287 --> 01:42:41.889
A, YOU KNOW, THE OTHER SET OF

01:42:41.955 --> 01:42:43.423
ISSUES THAT THEY'RE RAISING. AND

01:42:43.490 --> 01:42:45.492
THIS IS NOT AN AREA THAT I KNOW

01:42:45.559 --> 01:42:46.894
AT ALL, BUT, YOU KNOW, IS

01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:48.095
RELATED TO PRIOR RESTRAINTS ON

01:42:48.161 --> 01:42:50.564
SPEECH, WHICH I DO THINK ARE

01:42:50.631 --> 01:42:53.767
DIFFERENT, BOTH FOR THE

01:42:53.834 --> 01:42:55.702
COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND THE MPAA.

01:42:55.769 --> 01:42:57.104
AND FRANKLY, PROBABLY WHAT

01:42:57.170 --> 01:42:58.672
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO, GIVEN SORT

01:42:58.739 --> 01:43:00.274
OF WHO ELSE IS SUPPORTING THIS.

01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:03.577
SO I JUST WANT TO ASK AGAIN,

01:43:03.644 --> 01:43:05.779
YOUR COMMITMENT TO BOTH WORK ON

01:43:05.846 --> 01:43:06.780
THE FREE SPEECH ISSUES AND

01:43:06.847 --> 01:43:07.948
CONFORMING THE INJUNCTIVE

01:43:08.015 --> 01:43:10.517
RELIEF. I THINK IF YOU KNOW, IF

01:43:10.584 --> 01:43:11.518
THE THING THAT IS COMPELLING TO

01:43:11.585 --> 01:43:13.186
ME IS ACTUALLY HIGHLIGHTING THE

01:43:13.253 --> 01:43:15.522
AVAILABILITY TO THIS, BUT I AM

01:43:15.589 --> 01:43:17.090
CONCERNED ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES

01:43:17.157 --> 01:43:19.693
BETWEEN THE STANDARD AND

01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:21.261
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. AND SO

01:43:21.328 --> 01:43:23.330
I URGE YOU TO TRY TO CONFORM

01:43:23.397 --> 01:43:26.300
THIS TO THE NORMAL PROCEDURES.

01:43:26.366 --> 01:43:27.200
ABSOLUTELY. YOU KNOW, WE'LL KEEP

01:43:27.267 --> 01:43:29.002
LOOKING AT IT. MY UNDERSTANDING

01:43:29.069 --> 01:43:31.071
OF MY OWN BILL IS THAT THE JUDGE

01:43:31.138 --> 01:43:32.773
HAS DISCRETION, AGAIN, AS

01:43:32.839 --> 01:43:34.141
AMENDED, AS DISCRETION EVEN OVER

01:43:34.207 --> 01:43:38.478
THE 48 HOURS. SO I THINK THAT'S,

01:43:38.545 --> 01:43:40.647
YOU KNOW, I HOPE I DIDN'T LEAN

01:43:40.714 --> 01:43:43.317
IN TOO HARD ON THE 48 HOURS AS A

01:43:43.383 --> 01:43:45.586
BACKSTOP AND MISLEAD ANYBODY.

01:43:45.652 --> 01:43:47.187
BUT THE WAY THE BILL IS AMENDED

01:43:47.254 --> 01:43:49.923
NOW IS COMPLETELY UP TO THE

01:43:49.990 --> 01:43:53.293
JUDGE, YOU KNOW, BUT IT

01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:54.227
CERTAINLY ENCOURAGES THE

01:43:54.294 --> 01:43:57.364
PLAINTIFF TO, TO WALK INTO LAW

01:43:57.431 --> 01:43:59.833
IN MOTION AND MAKE THAT PLEA. I

01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:01.234
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT'S WHAT I'M

01:44:01.301 --> 01:44:03.470
TRYING TO DO. JUDGE, WE NEED 48

01:44:03.537 --> 01:44:04.338
HOURS. BUT THE WAY THE BILL'S

01:44:04.404 --> 01:44:06.473
WRITTEN, THE JUDGE STILL GETS TO

01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:08.642
SAY NO. I THINK IT SHOULD BE

01:44:08.709 --> 01:44:10.110
FOUR DAYS. YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE

01:44:10.177 --> 01:44:12.813
WAY WE LEFT IT. SO I THINK BUT I

01:44:12.879 --> 01:44:14.114
AS A COMMITMENT TO YOU AND YOUR

01:44:14.181 --> 01:44:15.616
CONCERN, WHICH I FEEL IS

01:44:15.682 --> 01:44:17.517
OBVIOUSLY VERY GENUINE, WE'LL GO

01:44:17.584 --> 01:44:19.987
BACK AND REREAD AND MAKE SURE

01:44:20.053 --> 01:44:21.154
AND ACTUALLY COME BACK TO

01:44:21.221 --> 01:44:22.155
COMMITTEE STAFF. THAT'S OKAY

01:44:22.222 --> 01:44:24.324
WITH THE CHAIR AND, AND MAKE

01:44:24.391 --> 01:44:25.926
SURE WE'VE GOT IT EXACTLY RIGHT.

01:44:25.993 --> 01:44:27.194
THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS

01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:29.329
OR COMMENTS? WELL, FOR A BILL

01:44:29.396 --> 01:44:30.764
THAT PURPORTEDLY DOESN'T DO A

01:44:30.831 --> 01:44:32.633
WHOLE LOT, WE HAD A WHOLE LOT OF

01:44:32.699 --> 01:44:33.867
CONVERSATION. BUT IN ALL

01:44:33.934 --> 01:44:36.103
SERIOUSNESS, I DO THINK THIS IS

01:44:36.169 --> 01:44:36.737
A VERY IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION.

01:44:36.803 --> 01:44:37.838
AND THE STAKEHOLDERS YOU'RE

01:44:37.904 --> 01:44:38.905
REPRESENTING DON'T HAVE

01:44:38.972 --> 01:44:40.340
LOBBYISTS AND ALL WHAT HAVE YOU.

01:44:40.407 --> 01:44:41.942
AND I DO APPRECIATE THE

01:44:42.009 --> 01:44:43.677
OPPOSITION BEING HERE AND

01:44:43.744 --> 01:44:44.645
RAISING THESE CONCERNS. AS A

01:44:44.711 --> 01:44:45.879
COLLEAGUE MENTIONED, THIS DID

01:44:45.946 --> 01:44:47.280
MAKE IT THROUGH THE SENATE AND

01:44:47.347 --> 01:44:49.616
IT'S HERE NOW. BUT AT THE END OF

01:44:49.683 --> 01:44:50.951
THE DAY, IT LOOKS LIKE

01:44:51.018 --> 01:44:52.419
OPPOSITION AND YOU, YOU KNOW,

01:44:52.486 --> 01:44:53.453
ARE ALL WILLING TO CONTINUE TO

01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:55.188
WORK ON SOME OF THE DETAILS THAT

01:44:55.255 --> 01:44:57.290
MAY BE UNIQUE TO CERTAIN

01:44:57.357 --> 01:44:58.392
INDUSTRIES, WHICH IS NOT

01:44:58.458 --> 01:44:59.026
NECESSARILY THE FOCUS OF WHAT

01:44:59.092 --> 01:45:00.327
YOU YOUR INTENTIONS ARE. BUT WE

01:45:00.394 --> 01:45:02.195
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT CONCERNS

01:45:02.262 --> 01:45:04.364
ARE DEALT WITH IN AN APPROPRIATE

01:45:04.431 --> 01:45:06.600
MANNER. THIS IS A SPACE THAT I

01:45:06.667 --> 01:45:07.267
KNOW OUR CHAIR OF PRIVACY,

01:45:07.334 --> 01:45:09.569
MYSELF AND OTHERS HAVE DONE SOME

01:45:09.636 --> 01:45:11.071
WORK IN, SO I REALLY APPRECIATE

01:45:11.138 --> 01:45:14.041
YOU LEANING IN ON ON AN ISSUE

01:45:14.107 --> 01:45:15.909
THAT THAT WHOSE FOCUS IS REALLY

01:45:15.976 --> 01:45:17.711
THOSE VICTIMS THAT, THAT DON'T

01:45:17.778 --> 01:45:19.780
HAVE FOLKS TO STAND UP FOR THEM

01:45:19.846 --> 01:45:20.781
OFTENTIMES. SO I REALLY

01:45:20.847 --> 01:45:22.449
APPRECIATE THAT. SENATOR, WOULD

01:45:22.516 --> 01:45:24.151

ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU.

THANK YOU AGAIN. AND THE MOTION

01:45:27.154 --> 01:45:28.555
IS DO PASS, AS AMENDED, TO

01:45:28.622 --> 01:45:30.457
PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION.

01:45:30.524 --> 01:45:33.326
CALLER I, CALLER I. DIXON. DIXON

UNANIMOUSLY. THANK YOU. YEAH.

RESOLUTION. HE'S ALSO. YEAH. SO

01:46:04.991 --> 01:46:07.527
I BELIEVE SENATOR UMBERG WILL BE

SCR 66 FIRST. OKAY. WE HAVE A

01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:22.609
MOTION. IS THERE A SECOND AND A

01:46:22.676 --> 01:46:24.644
SECOND? OH, YOU KNOW WHAT? I DO

01:46:35.989 --> 01:46:37.290
MOTION SITTING AROUND ON THE

01:46:37.357 --> 01:46:38.458
TABLE SOMEWHERE, AND WE'LL COME

01:46:38.525 --> 01:46:41.595
BACK TO SB 11. ALL RIGHT, SB 11,

01:46:41.661 --> 01:46:43.830
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ABUSE.

01:46:43.897 --> 01:46:45.632
AS YOU MENTIONED, MR. CHAIR, I

01:46:45.699 --> 01:46:47.367
AM PRESENTING THE BILL THIS

01:46:47.434 --> 01:46:50.203
MORNING FOR SENATOR ASHBY, WHO

01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:54.007
UNFORTUNATELY COULD NOT BE HERE.

01:46:54.074 --> 01:46:54.941
I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE

01:46:55.008 --> 01:46:57.144
COMMITTEE'S AMENDMENTS. THE AI

01:46:57.210 --> 01:46:58.712
ABUSE PROTECTION ACT ESTABLISHES

01:46:58.779 --> 01:47:00.380
A LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR REGULATING

01:47:00.447 --> 01:47:02.215
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, VOICE,

01:47:02.282 --> 01:47:04.251
IMAGE AND VIDEO CLONING

01:47:04.317 --> 01:47:06.486
TECHNOLOGY. IT REQUIRES A

01:47:06.553 --> 01:47:09.656
WARNING WHEN SOMEONE IS

01:47:09.723 --> 01:47:11.892
BASICALLY PURVEYING AN

01:47:11.958 --> 01:47:14.795
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MODEL

01:47:14.861 --> 01:47:16.863
THAT SAYS, HEY, THIS COULD BE

01:47:16.930 --> 01:47:20.500
MISUSED. IT ALSO REQUIRES THAT

01:47:20.567 --> 01:47:23.303
THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL DEVELOP

01:47:23.370 --> 01:47:25.505
STANDARDS FOR REGULATING

01:47:25.572 --> 01:47:27.307
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN

01:47:27.374 --> 01:47:29.242
CONNECTION WITH EVIDENCE. WITH

01:47:29.309 --> 01:47:31.978
ME HERE TO TESTIFY IS DOCTOR

01:47:32.045 --> 01:47:35.916
SLASH PROFESSOR J. JOSEMA I,

01:47:35.982 --> 01:47:37.751
DEVELOPER AND CO-FOUNDER OF

01:47:37.818 --> 01:47:40.053
TRANSPARENCY COALITION. THANK

01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:42.722
YOU. CHAIR PLEASE. THANK YOU

01:47:42.789 --> 01:47:43.590
CHAIR. AND MEMBERS OF THE

01:47:43.657 --> 01:47:46.526
COMMITTEE. THANK YOU, SENATOR

01:47:46.593 --> 01:47:49.563
HOLMBERG. WE'RE AN INDEPENDENT

01:47:49.629 --> 01:47:50.831
NONPROFIT WHICH ADVOCATES FOR

01:47:50.897 --> 01:47:52.199
INCREASED TRANSPARENCY AND

01:47:52.265 --> 01:47:54.034
ACCOUNTABILITY IN GENERATIVE AI.

01:47:54.100 --> 01:47:56.036
AND HERE ARE THE REASONS WHY I

01:47:56.102 --> 01:47:58.371
THINK YOU SHOULD SUPPORT SB 11.

01:47:58.438 --> 01:48:01.208
I THINK, AS WE ALL KNOW, THAT

01:48:01.274 --> 01:48:02.209
THERE'S CLEAR EVIDENCE OF

01:48:02.275 --> 01:48:03.977
CONSUMER HARM FROM THE CREATION

01:48:04.044 --> 01:48:06.179
OR ABUSE OF THESE TOOLS. THE

01:48:06.246 --> 01:48:07.981
SECOND IS THAT AI MODEL

01:48:08.048 --> 01:48:09.182
DEVELOPERS HAVE A DUTY OF CARE

01:48:09.249 --> 01:48:11.151
THAT THEY ARE NOT FULFILLING.

01:48:11.218 --> 01:48:13.720
THEY'RE ABLE TO PRODUCE IMAGES

01:48:13.787 --> 01:48:15.622
BECAUSE WHEN THESE MODELS ARE

01:48:15.689 --> 01:48:17.724
BEING DEVELOPED OR TESTED,

01:48:17.791 --> 01:48:19.659
PROPER CARE IS NOT BEING

01:48:19.726 --> 01:48:22.395
EXERCISED. AND THERE'S ALSO

01:48:22.462 --> 01:48:24.598
THIRD EVIDENCE THAT CONSUMER

01:48:24.664 --> 01:48:26.800
WARNINGS CAN AFFECT BEHAVIOR.

01:48:26.867 --> 01:48:29.202
AND OBVIOUSLY THERE'S STATE OF

01:48:29.269 --> 01:48:31.137
CALIFORNIA IS A LEADER IN

01:48:31.204 --> 01:48:33.874
DEPLOYING THEM AND STRONG. WE

01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:35.008
ALSO BELIEVE THAT STRONG

01:48:35.075 --> 01:48:36.243
PENALTIES AND LEGAL RECOURSE

01:48:36.309 --> 01:48:37.911
WILL ENCOURAGE MODEL DEVELOPERS

01:48:37.978 --> 01:48:40.747
TO EXERCISE GREATER CARE,

01:48:40.814 --> 01:48:42.515
ESPECIALLY WITH A PENAL CODE

01:48:42.582 --> 01:48:45.886
VIOLATION AND A CIVIL LITIGATION

01:48:45.952 --> 01:48:46.553
PROVISION. WE THINK THAT THAT'S

01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:49.089
A VERY IMPORTANT PROVISION. I

01:48:49.155 --> 01:48:50.690
THINK THE LAST THING WE WANT TO

01:48:50.757 --> 01:48:52.692
SAY ABOUT THIS IS THAT THE

01:48:52.759 --> 01:48:54.527
JUDICIAL COUNCIL GUIDELINES ARE

01:48:54.594 --> 01:48:55.662
SUPER IMPORTANT. THERE'S A LOT

01:48:55.729 --> 01:48:57.631
OF CONCERN AROUND THE INTEGRITY

01:48:57.697 --> 01:48:59.099
OF JUDICIAL EVIDENCE, AND

01:48:59.165 --> 01:49:02.569
THERE'S TECHNOLOGIES AVAILABLE

01:49:02.636 --> 01:49:04.537
TO PROPERLY LABEL AND ENSURE

01:49:04.604 --> 01:49:06.539
THAT THE DATA IS SECURE ALL THE

01:49:06.606 --> 01:49:08.508
WAY THROUGH TO CONSIDERATION. SO

01:49:08.575 --> 01:49:10.810
BUT I THINK MAKING THAT CLEAR IN

01:49:10.877 --> 01:49:12.779
THE LAW WOULD BE SUPER HELPFUL

01:49:12.846 --> 01:49:15.015
IN THIS BILL CALLS FOR THAT. SO

01:49:15.081 --> 01:49:17.183
IT'S REALLY THANK YOU FOR THE

01:49:17.250 --> 01:49:20.153
OPPORTUNITY AND URGE THE

01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:22.622
COMMITTEE TO PASS WITH A STRONG

01:49:22.689 --> 01:49:24.424
RECOMMENDATION. THANK YOU. IS

01:49:24.491 --> 01:49:27.227

01:50:07.133 --> 01:50:08.702

OF US HAVE ALSO DONE WORK IN.

01:50:11.938 --> 01:50:15.575
AND IT'S VERY COMPLICATED. YET I

01:50:15.642 --> 01:50:17.210
KNOW THAT YOU AND YOUR TEAM HAVE

01:50:17.277 --> 01:50:19.079

01:50:29.155 --> 01:50:32.225
CHOLERA. CHOLERA I. DIXON.

EISENBERG. I, I THANK YOU. THAT

01:50:51.611 --> 01:50:53.313
BILL IS OUT. SO THANK SENATOR

01:50:53.380 --> 01:50:56.016
ASHBY AND HER TEAM FOR THEIR

01:50:56.082 --> 01:50:57.550
WORK ON THAT. AND I THANK YOU

01:50:57.617 --> 01:50:58.685
FOR PRESENTING SENATOR UMBERG.

01:50:58.752 --> 01:51:03.156
AND THEN YOU HAVE SCR 66. WELL,

01:51:03.223 --> 01:51:06.159
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. TYPICALLY

01:51:06.226 --> 01:51:08.161
A LAW DAY RESOLUTION WOULD BE

01:51:08.228 --> 01:51:09.863
LIKE RECOGNIZING CALIFORNIA'S

01:51:09.929 --> 01:51:11.931
POTATO GROWERS. NOT PARTICULARLY

01:51:11.998 --> 01:51:13.800
CONTROVERSIAL, NOT SO MUCH THIS

01:51:13.867 --> 01:51:17.804
YEAR. THIS RECOGNIZES MAY 1ST AS

01:51:17.871 --> 01:51:19.472
LAW DAY. I KNOW WE PASSED MAY

01:51:19.539 --> 01:51:21.408
1ST, BUT IT'S STILL AN IMPORTANT

01:51:21.474 --> 01:51:22.475
RESOLUTION. IT'S AN IMPORTANT

01:51:22.542 --> 01:51:24.577
RESOLUTION TO RECOGNIZE MAY 1ST.

01:51:24.644 --> 01:51:26.479
THE REASON THAT WE HAVE LAW DAY

01:51:26.546 --> 01:51:28.548
ON MAY 1ST IS BECAUSE PRESIDENT

01:51:28.615 --> 01:51:33.620
EISENHOWER NOTICED THAT IN THE

01:51:33.686 --> 01:51:35.088
WHAT IS NOW THE FORMER SOVIET

01:51:35.155 --> 01:51:37.857
UNION AND IN MANY EASTERN BLOC

01:51:37.924 --> 01:51:38.958
COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS OTHER

01:51:39.025 --> 01:51:41.294
COUNTRIES THAT ARE CONTROLLED BY

01:51:41.361 --> 01:51:42.262
COMMUNIST DICTATORSHIPS, THAT

01:51:42.328 --> 01:51:43.730
THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT DAY. IT

01:51:43.797 --> 01:51:45.465
WAS A DAY OF CELEBRATION, MUCH

01:51:45.532 --> 01:51:48.868
LIKE OUR 4TH OF JULY. AND TO

01:51:48.935 --> 01:51:50.537
COUNTERPOSE WHAT WE DO IN THE

01:51:50.603 --> 01:51:51.604
UNITED STATES. HE ESTABLISHED

01:51:51.671 --> 01:51:54.107
LAW DAY TO RECOGNIZE THE RULE OF

01:51:54.174 --> 01:51:55.742
LAW AND THE IMPORTANCE IN TERMS

01:51:55.809 --> 01:51:58.011
OF MAINTAINING DEMOCRACY. I

01:51:58.078 --> 01:51:59.913
THINK THAT THAT THAT ISSUE HAS

01:51:59.979 --> 01:52:01.581
BEEN CHARACTERIZED AS FAIRLY

01:52:01.648 --> 01:52:03.583
ESOTERIC. IN FACT, DID A RECENT

01:52:03.650 --> 01:52:04.818
MEETING WITH SOME OF MY

01:52:04.884 --> 01:52:07.120
CONSTITUENTS, PERSON ASKED ME,

01:52:07.187 --> 01:52:09.055
SAID, WHAT DOES THE RULE OF LAW

01:52:09.122 --> 01:52:10.557
DO TO THE PRICE OF EGGS? WHY DO

01:52:10.623 --> 01:52:13.693
I CARE ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW IN

01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:14.294
CONNECTION WITH THE PRICE OF

01:52:14.360 --> 01:52:16.196
EGGS? AND THE RESPONSE IS THE

01:52:16.262 --> 01:52:17.530
REASON YOU CARE ABOUT THE RULE

01:52:17.597 --> 01:52:19.332
OF LAW AND THE PRICE OF EGGS IS

01:52:19.399 --> 01:52:20.633
BECAUSE WITHOUT THE RULE OF LAW,

01:52:20.700 --> 01:52:22.802
WE DON'T HAVE EGGS. WITHOUT THE

01:52:22.869 --> 01:52:24.070
RULE OF LAW, WE DON'T HAVE

01:52:24.137 --> 01:52:25.905
DEMOCRACY. IT'S AN ESOTERIC

01:52:25.972 --> 01:52:26.973
TOPIC, BUT WE HAVE NOT DONE. AND

01:52:27.040 --> 01:52:28.041
I'LL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY MYSELF

01:52:28.108 --> 01:52:29.342
FOR COMMUNICATING TO OUR

01:52:29.409 --> 01:52:29.976
CONSTITUENTS THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:52:30.043 --> 01:52:31.911
THE RULE OF LAW, PARTICULARLY

01:52:31.978 --> 01:52:33.346
IMPORTANT TODAY WITH WHAT'S

01:52:33.413 --> 01:52:35.882
GOING ON IN AND AROUND

01:52:35.949 --> 01:52:37.283
CALIFORNIA AND THE UNITED

01:52:37.350 --> 01:52:40.186
STATES. THE CHALLENGE THAT WE

01:52:40.253 --> 01:52:44.224
HAVE IS THAT THERE ARE SOME WHO

01:52:44.290 --> 01:52:46.726
DON'T RECOGNIZE THE RULE OF LAW

01:52:46.793 --> 01:52:49.329
AS OTHERS MIGHT. SO, FOR

01:52:49.395 --> 01:52:51.831
EXAMPLE, WHERE YOU BASICALLY TRY

01:52:51.898 --> 01:52:53.933
TO PUT LAW FIRMS OUT OF BUSINESS

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:55.268
BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE THEIR

01:52:55.335 --> 01:52:56.769
CLIENTS OR YOU DON'T LIKE THE

01:52:56.836 --> 01:52:57.837
INDIVIDUALS THAT MAY BE

01:52:57.904 --> 01:53:00.340
ASSOCIATED OR INVOLVED OR

01:53:00.406 --> 01:53:01.841
EMPLOYED BY THAT LAW FIRM. YOU

01:53:01.908 --> 01:53:03.376
BASICALLY ATTEMPT TO PUT THEM

01:53:03.443 --> 01:53:05.078
OUT OF BUSINESS. AND THIS

01:53:05.145 --> 01:53:06.513
RESOLUTION COMMENDS THOSE LAW

01:53:06.579 --> 01:53:07.747
FIRMS THAT HAVE STOOD UP AND

01:53:07.814 --> 01:53:10.383
SAID, LOOK AT THIS IS AN

01:53:10.450 --> 01:53:11.618
ABROGATION OF WHAT WE STOOD FOR

01:53:11.684 --> 01:53:15.255
THE LAST COUPLE CENTURIES AND

01:53:15.321 --> 01:53:17.223
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR THOSE OF

01:53:17.290 --> 01:53:19.826
US IN THE PROFESSION TO STAND UP

01:53:19.893 --> 01:53:22.295
FOR THE RULE OF LAW. AND I COUNT

01:53:22.362 --> 01:53:23.663
EIGHT MEMBERS OF THE PROFESSION

01:53:23.730 --> 01:53:24.931
HERE ON THIS COMMITTEE, WHICH IS

01:53:24.998 --> 01:53:26.733
MORE THAN EXISTS IN THE ENTIRE

01:53:26.799 --> 01:53:29.269
STATE SENATE. SO I HOPE THAT

01:53:29.335 --> 01:53:31.371
YOU'LL JOIN WITH ME. YOU'LL JOIN

01:53:31.437 --> 01:53:33.806
WITH ME IN RECOGNIZING MAY 1ST

01:53:33.873 --> 01:53:39.212
AS LAW DAY AND ESTABLISHING OUR

01:53:39.279 --> 01:53:41.414
SUPPORT FOR THE RULE OF LAW.

01:53:41.481 --> 01:53:43.616
WITH THAT, I URGE, AND I VOTE.

01:53:43.683 --> 01:53:49.422
ALL RIGHT. IS THERE IS THERE

01:53:49.489 --> 01:53:51.191
ANYONE ELSE HERE IN SUPPORT OF

01:53:51.257 --> 01:53:54.294
SCR SIX? ANYONE HERE IN

01:53:54.360 --> 01:53:57.430
OPPOSITION TO SCR 66 COMMITTEE?

01:53:57.497 --> 01:53:59.032
WE ALREADY HAVE A MOTION. ANY

01:53:59.098 --> 01:54:00.066
OTHER FURTHER QUESTIONS OR

01:54:00.133 --> 01:54:00.633
COMMENTS? ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:54:00.700 --> 01:54:02.669
PACHECO I WOULD LOVE TO BE ADDED

01:54:02.735 --> 01:54:06.272
AS A COAUTHOR. HAPPY TO DO SO.

01:54:06.339 --> 01:54:07.640
THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:54:07.707 --> 01:54:10.610
O'BRIEN NO, I THINK THIS IS

01:54:10.677 --> 01:54:11.644
INCREDIBLY TIMELY, SENATOR. I

01:54:11.711 --> 01:54:13.346
THINK IT PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE

01:54:13.413 --> 01:54:14.981
SAILED THROUGH ON CONSENT, BUT I

01:54:15.048 --> 01:54:16.583
THINK THINGS THAT MAKE A LOT OF

01:54:16.649 --> 01:54:18.184
COMMON SENSE SEEM TO BE

01:54:18.251 --> 01:54:19.018
CONTROVERSIAL IN THE CURRENT

01:54:19.085 --> 01:54:20.987
MOMENT. I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE IT

01:54:21.054 --> 01:54:23.256
WAS PRESIDENT EISENHOWER WHO

01:54:23.323 --> 01:54:26.526
SINGLED OUT MAY 1ST. HE'S BEEN A

01:54:26.593 --> 01:54:27.860
VERY INTERESTING TOPIC AS OF

01:54:27.927 --> 01:54:30.163
LATE FOR HIS WILLINGNESS TO

01:54:30.230 --> 01:54:31.998
FOLLOW THE DIRECTIVES OF THE

01:54:32.065 --> 01:54:33.366
SUPREME COURT IN REGARDS TO

01:54:33.433 --> 01:54:34.801
BROWN VERSUS BOARD OF EDUCATION

01:54:34.867 --> 01:54:35.935
AND OTHER IMPORTANT RULINGS THAT

01:54:36.002 --> 01:54:39.138
THEY HAD. HE ALSO WAS ONE OF THE

01:54:39.205 --> 01:54:41.541
VERY FEW PRESIDENTS WHO

01:54:41.608 --> 01:54:42.408
COMMANDEERED THE NATIONAL GUARD

01:54:42.475 --> 01:54:43.643
OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS, I

01:54:43.710 --> 01:54:47.313
BELIEVE, TO OVERRULE GEORGE

01:54:47.380 --> 01:54:49.115
WALLACE, GOVERNOR WALLACE, AND

01:54:49.182 --> 01:54:50.617
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO WERE

01:54:50.683 --> 01:54:51.918
PREVENTING BLACK CHILDREN FROM

01:54:51.985 --> 01:54:53.686
INTEGRATING SCHOOLS AND GETTING

01:54:53.753 --> 01:54:56.723
EQUAL ACCESS TO EDUCATION,

01:54:56.789 --> 01:54:57.457
DECISIVELY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT

01:54:57.523 --> 01:54:59.425
WE'RE SEEING HERE IN CALIFORNIA

01:54:59.492 --> 01:55:01.027
IN THIS EXACT MOMENT, WITH A

01:55:01.094 --> 01:55:03.830
CASE BEING HEARD TODAY ABOUT THE

01:55:03.896 --> 01:55:04.464
CONSTITUTIONALITY AND THE RULE

01:55:04.530 --> 01:55:06.299
OF LAW UNDER THE ACTIONS OF THE

01:55:06.366 --> 01:55:08.101
CURRENT PRESIDENT. SO I JUST

01:55:08.167 --> 01:55:09.269
WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING

01:55:09.335 --> 01:55:10.703
THIS RESOLUTION FORWARD. I THINK

01:55:10.770 --> 01:55:12.071
SOMETIMES THINGS HAPPEN AT THE

01:55:12.138 --> 01:55:13.640
TIME AND SPEED IN WHICH THEY'RE

01:55:13.706 --> 01:55:15.441
SUPPOSED TO. AND SO EVEN THOUGH

01:55:15.508 --> 01:55:16.576
WE'VE MISSED MAY 1ST, I THINK

01:55:16.643 --> 01:55:19.012
IT'S I'M GRATEFUL TO BE HEARING

01:55:19.078 --> 01:55:19.646
THIS TODAY. AND YOU DEFINITELY

01:55:19.712 --> 01:55:22.649
HAVE MY SUPPORT. SENATOR BARBARA

01:55:22.715 --> 01:55:24.717
KHN, THANK YOU, SENATOR, FOR

01:55:24.784 --> 01:55:27.153
BRINGING THIS. AND I THINK THAT

01:55:27.220 --> 01:55:29.422
ALL OF US WHO PRACTICED LAW ARE

01:55:29.489 --> 01:55:31.658
REFLECTING ON WHAT THE LAW MEANS

01:55:31.724 --> 01:55:34.093
AT THIS MOMENT. MY FIRST

01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:35.695
INTERNSHIP IN LAW SCHOOL WAS AT

01:55:35.762 --> 01:55:37.263
THE ACLU. I REMEMBER THEY WERE

01:55:37.330 --> 01:55:40.633
AT THE TIME, WORKING ON A CASE

01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:41.034
FOR PROTECTING THE

01:55:41.100 --> 01:55:41.567
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF

01:55:41.634 --> 01:55:42.735
NEO-NAZIS. AS THE GRANDDAUGHTER

01:55:42.802 --> 01:55:43.803
OF HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS, THAT

01:55:43.870 --> 01:55:45.471
MADE ME INCREDIBLY

01:55:45.538 --> 01:55:46.739
UNCOMFORTABLE. BUT I ALSO

01:55:46.806 --> 01:55:48.374
UNDERSTOOD THAT THE RULE OF LAW

01:55:48.441 --> 01:55:50.943
IS THE RULE OF LAW, AND A

01:55:51.010 --> 01:55:51.444
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT IS

01:55:51.511 --> 01:55:51.978
MEANINGLESS UNLESS IT'S

01:55:52.045 --> 01:55:53.379
PROTECTED FOR EVERYBODY. I THEN

01:55:53.446 --> 01:55:55.715
WENT ON TO WORK AT A BIG LAW

01:55:55.782 --> 01:55:57.750
FIRM. MANY OF OUR CLIENTS,

01:55:57.817 --> 01:55:58.985
PEOPLE THOUGHT, WERE NOT FOLKS

01:55:59.052 --> 01:56:00.920
WHO YOU WOULD WANT TO BE ALIGNED

01:56:00.987 --> 01:56:02.155
WITH, AND I DON'T THINK WE

01:56:02.221 --> 01:56:03.990
BELIEVED WE WERE ALIGNED WITH

01:56:04.057 --> 01:56:05.391
THEM. WE BELIEVED THAT THE

01:56:05.458 --> 01:56:07.260
JUDICIAL SYSTEM ONLY WORKS WHEN

01:56:07.327 --> 01:56:08.594
EVERYBODY HAS ACCESS TO COUNSEL,

01:56:08.661 --> 01:56:10.229
AND THAT IT WAS OUR JOB TO

01:56:10.296 --> 01:56:11.831
REPRESENT FAITHFULLY OUR CLIENTS

01:56:11.898 --> 01:56:14.067
AND FOR THE OTHER SIDE TO DO THE

01:56:14.133 --> 01:56:16.135
SAME, AND FOR THE COURTS TO FIND

01:56:16.202 --> 01:56:17.303
JUSTICE WHERE APPROPRIATE. AND I

01:56:17.370 --> 01:56:18.638
FIND IT INCREDIBLY FRIGHTENING

01:56:18.705 --> 01:56:20.840
AT THIS MOMENT THAT WE WOULD

01:56:20.907 --> 01:56:24.143
HAVE ATTORNEYS WHO WOULD CHOOSE

01:56:24.210 --> 01:56:25.578
CLIENTS FOR ANY OTHER REASON

01:56:25.645 --> 01:56:26.813
THAN THEY DESERVE

01:56:26.879 --> 01:56:27.680
REPRESENTATION, BECAUSE THAT IS

01:56:27.747 --> 01:56:28.881
WHAT WILL MAKE THE JUDICIAL

01:56:28.948 --> 01:56:33.853
SYSTEM, I THINK, CRUMBLE. AND SO

01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:35.288
I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS, AND I

01:56:35.355 --> 01:56:36.723
KNOW THERE ARE SO MANY LAWYERS

01:56:36.789 --> 01:56:38.691
OUT THERE WHO RIGHT NOW ARE

01:56:38.758 --> 01:56:39.625
STANDING UP AND SPEAKING OUT

01:56:39.692 --> 01:56:41.394
LOUDLY TO YOUR POINT, TO DEFEND

01:56:41.461 --> 01:56:42.962
THE RULE OF LAW, TO DEFEND THE

01:56:43.029 --> 01:56:47.166
JUDICIARY. BUT IT IS NOT ABOUT

01:56:47.233 --> 01:56:48.768
WHETHER WE AGREE OR DISAGREE ON

01:56:48.835 --> 01:56:50.370
THE MERITS OF A CASE. IT IS

01:56:50.436 --> 01:56:53.439
ABOUT ALLOWING FOR THE LAW TO DO

01:56:53.506 --> 01:56:56.209
ITS THING AND DECIDE WHERE THE

01:56:56.275 --> 01:56:58.711
CHIPS FALL. AT THE END OF VERY

01:56:58.778 --> 01:57:01.347
DIFFICULT ARGUMENTS, LONG CASES,

01:57:01.414 --> 01:57:03.049
AND THEN COMPLYING, BECAUSE THAT

01:57:03.116 --> 01:57:04.784
IS WHAT ALLOWS OUR SOCIETY TO

01:57:04.851 --> 01:57:06.619
STAND UP, WHICH YOU'VE SO DEFTLY

01:57:06.686 --> 01:57:07.620
TALKED ABOUT. AND SO I THINK

01:57:07.687 --> 01:57:09.622
THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT AT THIS

01:57:09.689 --> 01:57:10.890
MOMENT, AND I HOPE THAT, YOU

01:57:10.957 --> 01:57:12.492
KNOW, WE CAN ALL SORT OF TAKE A

01:57:12.558 --> 01:57:14.494
MOMENT TO PAUSE AND REALIZE WHAT

01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:16.028
OUR ROLE IS AT THIS MOMENT IN

01:57:16.095 --> 01:57:18.097
PROTECTING LAW AND THE JUDICIARY

01:57:18.164 --> 01:57:20.600
SO THAT WE HAVE A DEMOCRACY THAT

01:57:20.666 --> 01:57:22.368
IS AS STRONG AS IT NEEDS TO BE.

01:57:22.435 --> 01:57:24.470
SO I APPRECIATE THAT. AND I'D

01:57:24.537 --> 01:57:26.205
ALSO LIKE TO ADD AS A COAUTHOR.

01:57:26.272 --> 01:57:29.275
ALL RIGHT. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR

01:57:29.342 --> 01:57:31.144
QUESTIONS WOULD YOU LIKE TO

01:57:31.210 --> 01:57:32.445
CLOSE? THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I

01:57:32.512 --> 01:57:34.547
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AT THIS

01:57:34.614 --> 01:57:36.449
POINT ALSO TO RECOGNIZE AND

01:57:36.516 --> 01:57:38.050
COMMEND THOSE WHO HAVE THE

01:57:38.117 --> 01:57:40.052
COURAGE TO STAND UP FOR THE RULE

01:57:40.119 --> 01:57:43.022

JUDICIAL REVIEW PROCESS WHEN A

LOCAL HOUSING PERMIT APPLICATION

02:00:15.174 --> 02:00:16.976
IS DENIED IN VIOLATION OF STATE

02:00:17.043 --> 02:00:19.111
LAW. CALIFORNIA, AS YOU ALL

02:00:19.178 --> 02:00:21.213
KNOW, FACES A HOUSING

02:00:21.280 --> 02:00:22.481
AFFORDABILITY CRISIS FUELED IN

02:00:22.548 --> 02:00:23.783
LARGE PART BY OUR STATE'S

02:00:23.849 --> 02:00:25.718
HOUSING SHORTAGE AND THE

02:00:25.785 --> 02:00:27.420
INABILITY TO BUILD NEW HOUSING.

02:00:27.486 --> 02:00:28.821
AS A BODY, THIS LEGISLATURE HAS

02:00:28.888 --> 02:00:30.423
TAKEN ACTION TO ENCOURAGE

02:00:30.489 --> 02:00:31.757
HOUSING PRODUCTION THROUGH

02:00:31.824 --> 02:00:33.192
VARIOUS LEGISLATIVE AND

02:00:33.259 --> 02:00:35.394
INVESTMENT STRATEGIES. WE'VE

02:00:35.461 --> 02:00:36.429
STREAMLINED PERMITTING

02:00:36.495 --> 02:00:37.563
PROCESSES. WE'VE DECREASED

02:00:37.630 --> 02:00:40.132
INCREASED DENSITY. WE'VE CREATED

02:00:40.199 --> 02:00:41.167
BY RIGHT PROCESSES. WE'VE

02:00:41.233 --> 02:00:42.168
REQUIRED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO

02:00:42.234 --> 02:00:44.403
USE TRANSPARENT PROCESSES TO

02:00:44.470 --> 02:00:46.238
EVALUATE HOUSING PROPOSAL, AND

02:00:46.305 --> 02:00:47.940
WE HAVE INVESTED BILLIONS OF

02:00:48.007 --> 02:00:49.108
DOLLARS OVER THE COURSE OF THE

02:00:49.175 --> 02:00:51.210
LAST DECADE. DESPITE THESE

02:00:51.277 --> 02:00:52.712
POLICY AND BUDGET EFFORTS, OUR

02:00:52.778 --> 02:00:54.680
HOUSING SUPPLY IS STILL WOEFULLY

02:00:54.747 --> 02:00:56.682
INADEQUATE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF

02:00:56.749 --> 02:00:58.184
OUR RESIDENTS. SOME LOCAL

02:00:58.250 --> 02:01:00.086
AGENCIES, IN AN ATTEMPT TO BLOCK

02:01:00.152 --> 02:01:01.287
PROJECTS FROM MOVING FORWARD,

02:01:01.354 --> 02:01:02.955
KNOWINGLY DENY HOUSING PERMITS

02:01:03.022 --> 02:01:05.224
IN VIOLATION OF STATE LAW. WHILE

02:01:05.291 --> 02:01:06.325
HOUSING DEVELOPERS HAVE THE

02:01:06.392 --> 02:01:08.427
ABILITY TO CONTEST AN

02:01:08.494 --> 02:01:09.862
IMPERMISSIBLE, IMPERMISSIBLE

02:01:09.929 --> 02:01:12.164
PERMIT DENIAL VIA LITIGATION.

02:01:12.231 --> 02:01:14.166
THE FACT IS THAT MOST OF THESE

02:01:14.233 --> 02:01:15.968
PROJECTS DENIALS WILL NEVER GO

02:01:16.035 --> 02:01:17.436
TO COURT BECAUSE OF THE TIME AND

02:01:17.503 --> 02:01:19.605
COST ASSOCIATED WITH LEGAL

02:01:19.672 --> 02:01:21.407
ACTION. AND EVEN THOUGH THE

02:01:21.474 --> 02:01:23.342
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE ALSO

02:01:23.409 --> 02:01:25.044
HAS THE AUTHORITY TO CONTEST

02:01:25.111 --> 02:01:26.545
IMPROPER HOUSING DENIALS, THEY

02:01:26.612 --> 02:01:27.647
SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY

02:01:27.713 --> 02:01:29.382
TO BRING THESE CHALLENGES. WHEN

02:01:29.448 --> 02:01:31.550
LOCAL AGENCIES DENY HOUSING

02:01:31.617 --> 02:01:33.386
PROJECTS, THEY DON'T ONLY HARM

02:01:33.452 --> 02:01:34.887
DEVELOPERS AND HOUSING PROJECTS,

02:01:34.954 --> 02:01:36.555
BUT THEY ALSO EXACERBATE OUR

02:01:36.622 --> 02:01:39.191
STATE'S AFFORDABILITY CRISIS. TO

02:01:39.258 --> 02:01:41.060
ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS, SB 808

02:01:41.127 --> 02:01:42.662
WOULD CREATE AN EXPEDITED

02:01:42.728 --> 02:01:44.897
JUDICIAL REVIEW TO BRING SWIFT

02:01:44.964 --> 02:01:46.799
RESOLUTION TO THESE CASES, TO

02:01:46.866 --> 02:01:49.435
ALLOW PROJECTS TO MOVE QUICKLY,

02:01:49.502 --> 02:01:50.336
AND WILL INCENTIVIZE LOCAL

02:01:50.403 --> 02:01:52.071
GOVERNMENTS TO PROCESS

02:01:52.138 --> 02:01:53.239
APPLICATIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH

02:01:53.305 --> 02:01:55.274
STATE LAW WITHOUT ALTERING THE

02:01:55.341 --> 02:01:57.009
AUTHORITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

02:01:57.076 --> 02:01:58.911
WITH ME TO TESTIFY TODAY IN

02:01:58.978 --> 02:02:00.346
SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS SOSA

02:02:00.413 --> 02:02:03.215
SOSA, REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA

02:02:03.282 --> 02:02:04.784
YIMBY AND DEPUTY ATTORNEY

02:02:04.850 --> 02:02:06.819
GENERAL JANET STANFORD,

02:02:06.886 --> 02:02:08.387
LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR

02:02:08.454 --> 02:02:10.456
ATTORNEY GENERAL ROB BONTA.

02:02:10.523 --> 02:02:12.625
ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE ALEX FISH,

02:02:12.692 --> 02:02:14.093
SPECIAL ASSISTANT ATTORNEY

02:02:14.160 --> 02:02:15.494
GENERAL FOR HOUSING, AVAILABLE

02:02:15.561 --> 02:02:16.996
TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL

02:02:17.063 --> 02:02:18.264
QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK

02:02:18.330 --> 02:02:20.132
YOU, THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING,

02:02:20.199 --> 02:02:21.300
MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE

02:02:21.367 --> 02:02:22.635
MEMBERS, JANET STANFORD FOR THE

02:02:22.702 --> 02:02:24.103
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. I

02:02:24.170 --> 02:02:25.504
WANT TO START BY THANKING

02:02:25.571 --> 02:02:26.839
SENATOR CABALLERO FOR AUTHORING

02:02:26.906 --> 02:02:28.040
THIS IMPORTANT BILL, WHICH THE

02:02:28.107 --> 02:02:30.576
AG IS PROUD TO SPONSOR. AG BONTA

02:02:30.643 --> 02:02:31.711
IS COMMITTED TO USING ALL THE

02:02:31.777 --> 02:02:32.845
TOOLS AVAILABLE TO THE

02:02:32.912 --> 02:02:34.880
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO ADVANCE

02:02:34.947 --> 02:02:36.382
HOUSING ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY

02:02:36.449 --> 02:02:38.884
AND EQUITY IN CALIFORNIA. HE

02:02:38.951 --> 02:02:39.852
UNDERSTANDS THAT CALIFORNIANS

02:02:39.919 --> 02:02:41.353
ARE COUNTING ON THEIR ELECTED

02:02:41.420 --> 02:02:42.555
OFFICIALS TO BRING THE COST OF

02:02:42.621 --> 02:02:44.423
LIVING DOWN, AND WE KNOW THAT

02:02:44.490 --> 02:02:46.459
LACK OF HOUSING SUPPLY IS

02:02:46.525 --> 02:02:47.560
LEADING TO SKYROCKETING HOUSING

02:02:47.626 --> 02:02:49.295
PRICES. THE LEGISLATURE HAS

02:02:49.361 --> 02:02:51.163
PASSED LAWS TO ENSURE THAT LOCAL

02:02:51.230 --> 02:02:52.331
GOVERNMENTS WILL APPROVE LAWFUL

02:02:52.398 --> 02:02:53.632
HOUSING PROJECTS AND USE QUICK

02:02:53.699 --> 02:02:55.468
AND CLEAR PROCESSES TO MAKE

02:02:55.534 --> 02:02:56.869
DECISIONS ABOUT HOUSING

02:02:56.936 --> 02:02:57.570
PROPOSALS IN ACCORDANCE WITH

02:02:57.636 --> 02:02:59.071
THEIR OWN PLANS AND WITH STATE

02:02:59.138 --> 02:03:00.606
LAW. BUT SOMETIMES THERE'S STILL

02:03:00.673 --> 02:03:02.274
RESISTANCE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL,

02:03:02.341 --> 02:03:03.743
AND SOMETIMES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

02:03:03.809 --> 02:03:05.444
STILL FORCE BUILDERS TO CHOOSE

02:03:05.511 --> 02:03:06.746
BETWEEN ASSERTING THEIR RIGHTS

02:03:06.812 --> 02:03:08.380
IN COURT OR JUST WALKING AWAY

02:03:08.447 --> 02:03:09.181
FROM BUILDING HOUSING THAT'S

02:03:09.248 --> 02:03:10.249
SUPPOSED TO BE ALLOWED BY STATE

02:03:10.316 --> 02:03:12.718
LAW. LITIGATION DELAY CAN KILL A

02:03:12.785 --> 02:03:14.220
PROJECT ALTOGETHER. IT ALSO

02:03:14.286 --> 02:03:15.721
DRIVES UP THE COST OF BUILDING

02:03:15.788 --> 02:03:16.722
HOUSING, WHICH ESPECIALLY

02:03:16.789 --> 02:03:17.690
IMPACTS SMALLER BUILDERS, AND

02:03:17.757 --> 02:03:19.625
SMALLER PROJECTS WHICH CAN'T

02:03:19.692 --> 02:03:20.860
SUPPORT THE COST OF MONTHLY

02:03:20.926 --> 02:03:22.428
LEGAL BILLS AND INTEREST

02:03:22.495 --> 02:03:24.597
PAYMENTS. SO LITIGATION DELAY

02:03:24.663 --> 02:03:25.931
BECOMES A REAL BARRIER TO

02:03:25.998 --> 02:03:27.800
BUILDING HOMES. SB 808 WOULD

02:03:27.867 --> 02:03:29.568
CREATE AN EXPEDITED WRIT

02:03:29.635 --> 02:03:31.904
PROCEDURE TO SPEED UP PROCESSING

02:03:31.971 --> 02:03:32.505
OF HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT

02:03:32.571 --> 02:03:34.406
AND MINISTERIAL APPROVAL LAW

02:03:34.473 --> 02:03:36.075
CASES, WHICH ARE BROUGHT AS WRIT

02:03:36.142 --> 02:03:37.710
ACTIONS UNDER A CODE OF CIVIL

02:03:37.777 --> 02:03:40.446
PROCEDURE TEN, 94.5 OR 1085. WE

02:03:40.513 --> 02:03:42.081
WANT TO AVOID PROJECTS FOLDING

02:03:42.148 --> 02:03:43.315
DURING THE LITIGATION PROCESS,

02:03:43.382 --> 02:03:44.450
AND INCENTIVIZE LOCAL

02:03:44.517 --> 02:03:45.451
GOVERNMENTS TO DO THE RIGHT

02:03:45.518 --> 02:03:47.253
THING. WITHOUT LITIGATION,

02:03:47.319 --> 02:03:48.621
THERE'S ALREADY EXPEDITED

02:03:48.687 --> 02:03:49.822
JUDICIAL REVIEW FOR OTHER

02:03:49.889 --> 02:03:51.257
HOUSING LAWS, INCLUDING HOUSING

02:03:51.323 --> 02:03:52.958
ELEMENT CASES AND CERTAIN FIRST

02:03:53.025 --> 02:03:54.126
AMENDMENT RELATED HOUSING

02:03:54.193 --> 02:03:56.262
PERMITTING DISPUTES. WE THINK IT

02:03:56.328 --> 02:03:57.730
MAKES A LOT OF SENSE, ESPECIALLY

02:03:57.797 --> 02:04:00.699
IN THIS VERY DIRE HOUSING CRISIS

02:04:00.766 --> 02:04:01.901
THAT'S MAKING LIFE UNAFFORDABLE

02:04:01.967 --> 02:04:03.569
FOR SO MANY CALIFORNIANS, TO

02:04:03.636 --> 02:04:04.804
ALSO EXPEDITE JUDICIAL REVIEW OF

02:04:04.870 --> 02:04:06.505
THESE PROJECT LEVEL DISPUTES

02:04:06.572 --> 02:04:08.140
WHERE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE

02:04:08.207 --> 02:04:09.642
FAILED TO FOLLOW THE LAW AND

02:04:09.708 --> 02:04:12.678
PROCESS AND APPROVE APPLICATIONS

02:04:12.745 --> 02:04:13.479
TO BUILD HOUSING. WE

02:04:13.546 --> 02:04:15.080
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

02:04:15.147 --> 02:04:17.082
THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING, CHAIR

02:04:17.149 --> 02:04:19.018
AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. SO

02:04:19.084 --> 02:04:20.452
I'M HERE TODAY SPEAKING IN

02:04:20.519 --> 02:04:22.621
SUPPORT OF SB 808 ON BEHALF OF

02:04:22.688 --> 02:04:24.423
CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA IS A

02:04:24.490 --> 02:04:25.658
STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION OF OVER

02:04:25.724 --> 02:04:27.326
80,000 NEIGHBORS DEDICATED TO

02:04:27.393 --> 02:04:29.094
MAKING OUR STATE A MORE

02:04:29.161 --> 02:04:30.496
AFFORDABLE PLACE TO LIVE, WORK,

02:04:30.563 --> 02:04:33.332
AND RAISE A FAMILY. SB 808

02:04:33.399 --> 02:04:34.900
TACKLES A FRUSTRATING AND ALL

02:04:34.967 --> 02:04:36.168
TOO COMMON PROBLEM IN

02:04:36.235 --> 02:04:36.902
CALIFORNIA. HOUSING PROJECTS

02:04:36.969 --> 02:04:38.771
THAT COMPLY WITH LOCAL PLANS AND

02:04:38.838 --> 02:04:39.839
COMPLY WITH STATE LAW, BUT ARE

02:04:39.905 --> 02:04:41.574
STILL DENIED BY LOCAL

02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:42.508
GOVERNMENTS FOR REASONS THAT

02:04:42.575 --> 02:04:44.076
DON'T HOLD UP IN COURT. THESE

02:04:44.143 --> 02:04:45.578
DENIALS ARE NOT JUST WRONG, BUT

02:04:45.644 --> 02:04:47.513
AFFECT THE STATE'S PROGRESS

02:04:47.580 --> 02:04:48.781
TOWARDS REACHING ITS HOUSING

02:04:48.848 --> 02:04:51.350
GOALS. EVERY UNLAWFUL DELAY

02:04:51.417 --> 02:04:52.618
MEANS MORE FAMILIES ARE PRICED

02:04:52.685 --> 02:04:54.119
OUT, MORE WORKERS ARE COMMUTING

02:04:54.186 --> 02:04:56.021
HOURS TO THEIR JOBS, AND MORE

02:04:56.088 --> 02:04:56.655
CHILDREN ARE GROWING UP WITHOUT

02:04:56.722 --> 02:04:58.891
A SECURE PLACE TO CALL HOME.

02:04:58.958 --> 02:05:00.759
WHEN DEVELOPERS, ESPECIALLY

02:05:00.826 --> 02:05:02.194
SMALLER LOCAL BUILDERS, TRY TO

02:05:02.261 --> 02:05:03.562
FIGHT IN COURT FOR AUTHORITY TO

02:05:03.629 --> 02:05:05.030
BUILD MORE HOMES, THEY FACE

02:05:05.097 --> 02:05:06.799
YEARS OF COSTLY LITIGATION.

02:05:06.866 --> 02:05:08.267
OFTEN, THIS LITIGATION PREVENTS

02:05:08.334 --> 02:05:09.768
PROJECTS FROM EVER BREAKING

02:05:09.835 --> 02:05:13.005
GROUND. SB 808 CREATES A FASTER,

02:05:13.072 --> 02:05:15.241
MORE EFFICIENT JUDICIAL PROCESS

02:05:15.307 --> 02:05:17.209
TO RESOLVE THESE DISPUTES. IT

02:05:17.276 --> 02:05:18.677
DOESN'T STRIP LOCAL CONTROL. IT

02:05:18.744 --> 02:05:20.913
SIMPLY STATES THAT IF A DENIAL

02:05:20.980 --> 02:05:21.847
VIOLATES STATE LAW, THAT ISSUE

02:05:21.914 --> 02:05:23.749
SHOULD BE RESOLVED SWIFTLY,

02:05:23.816 --> 02:05:25.451
FAIRLY, AND WITHOUT UNNECESSARY

02:05:25.517 --> 02:05:28.454
DELAY. WE HAVE FOUND WAYS TO

02:05:28.520 --> 02:05:29.889
EXPEDITE JUDICIAL REVIEW IN

02:05:29.955 --> 02:05:31.257
OTHER AREAS THROUGHOUT THE STATE

02:05:31.323 --> 02:05:32.424
ON OTHER POLICIES, AND WE

02:05:32.491 --> 02:05:33.692
BELIEVE IT'S TIME TO APPLY THAT

02:05:33.759 --> 02:05:35.327
SAME URGENCY TO THE HOUSING

02:05:35.394 --> 02:05:36.729
CRISIS. WITH THAT, I

02:05:36.795 --> 02:05:38.297
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

02:05:38.364 --> 02:05:40.633
THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE

02:05:40.699 --> 02:05:49.742
HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB 808? MR.

02:05:49.808 --> 02:05:51.610
CHAIR MEMBERS BOB NEELY,

02:05:51.677 --> 02:05:53.012
REPRESENTING FIELDSTEAD AND

02:05:53.078 --> 02:05:54.113
COMPANY. THAT'S HOWARD AHMANSON

02:05:54.179 --> 02:05:57.683
JUNIOR IN ORANGE COUNTY AND

02:05:57.750 --> 02:05:58.217
PHILANTHROPIST AND STRONG

02:05:58.284 --> 02:06:00.586
SUPPORT. THANK YOU. GOOD

02:06:00.653 --> 02:06:01.954
MORNING, MR. CHAIR. AND MEMBERS.

02:06:02.021 --> 02:06:02.621
RAYMOND CONTRERAS WITH

02:06:02.688 --> 02:06:03.856
LIGHTHOUSE PUBLIC AFFAIRS ON

02:06:03.923 --> 02:06:05.124
BEHALF OF BUCKEYE PROPERTIES,

02:06:05.190 --> 02:06:07.059
COUNCIL OF INFILL BUILDERS,

02:06:07.126 --> 02:06:08.327
HABITAT FOR HUMANITY CALIFORNIA,

02:06:08.394 --> 02:06:11.030
LENNAR ABUNDANT HOUSING LOS

02:06:11.096 --> 02:06:11.697
ANGELES AND SPUR, ALL IN STRONG

02:06:11.764 --> 02:06:14.733
SUPPORT. THANK YOU. IS THERE

02:06:14.800 --> 02:06:16.468
ANYONE HERE IN OPPOSITION TO SB

02:06:16.535 --> 02:06:29.181
888? OF COURSE. THE SECOND.

02:06:29.248 --> 02:06:31.784
HELLO, MR. CHAIR AND MEMBERS,

02:06:31.850 --> 02:06:33.319
THE CHAIR IS HERE WITH THE

02:06:33.385 --> 02:06:34.787
JUDICIAL COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA

02:06:34.853 --> 02:06:36.789
IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION. THE

02:06:36.855 --> 02:06:38.324
JUDICIAL COUNCIL DOES APPRECIATE

02:06:38.390 --> 02:06:39.959
AND UNDERSTAND AND SYMPATHIZE

02:06:40.025 --> 02:06:42.328
WITH THE DESIRE TO ADD HOUSING.

02:06:42.394 --> 02:06:44.263
HOWEVER, DUE TO THE ADROITLY

02:06:44.330 --> 02:06:46.799
WRITTEN ANALYSIS, THE COMMITTEE

02:06:46.865 --> 02:06:48.434
OR EXCUSE ME, THE COUNCIL IS

02:06:48.500 --> 02:06:50.069
OPPOSED AS THIS BILL WOULD

02:06:50.135 --> 02:06:52.004
ESTABLISH AN UNREASONABLE,

02:06:52.071 --> 02:06:53.405
EXPEDITED JUDICIAL REVIEW

02:06:53.472 --> 02:06:56.775
PROCESS. IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE

02:06:56.842 --> 02:06:58.110
THE COURT TO HEAR MATTERS AND

02:06:58.177 --> 02:06:59.812
ISSUE DECISIONS WITHIN A

02:06:59.878 --> 02:07:01.580
REASONABLE TIME FRAMES, AND IT

02:07:01.647 --> 02:07:03.382
REQUIRES TEMPORARY ASSIGNMENT OF

02:07:03.449 --> 02:07:04.883
JUDICIAL OFFICERS, WHICH SOUNDS

02:07:04.950 --> 02:07:06.752
LIKE A RELIEF GAP. BUT IT REALLY

02:07:06.819 --> 02:07:08.587
IS NOT AS THOUGH THAT BECAUSE

02:07:08.654 --> 02:07:10.923
THERE ARE NOT OTHER JUDGES IN

02:07:10.990 --> 02:07:13.592
WHICH US TO REASSIGN. SO FOR

02:07:13.659 --> 02:07:15.327
THOSE REASONS, THE COUNCIL IS

02:07:15.394 --> 02:07:17.930
OPPOSED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

02:07:17.997 --> 02:07:18.630
IS THERE ANYONE ELSE HERE IN

02:07:18.697 --> 02:07:25.704
OPPOSITION TO SB EIGHT? ME TO.

02:07:25.771 --> 02:07:27.239
DAVID BULLOCK ON BEHALF OF

02:07:27.306 --> 02:07:28.307
MYSELF AND OPPOSITION. THANK

02:07:28.374 --> 02:07:32.978
YOU. THANK YOU. DO A MOTION. WE

02:07:33.045 --> 02:07:34.346
ALREADY HAVE A MOTION ON THE

02:07:34.413 --> 02:07:36.115
TABLE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR

02:07:36.181 --> 02:07:38.283
COMMENTS? ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S B¢O

02:07:38.350 --> 02:07:40.119
KHN. I WANT TO THANK THE

02:07:40.185 --> 02:07:43.022
SENATOR FOR THIS BILL. AND I

02:07:43.088 --> 02:07:44.723
VENTURED ACTUALLY TO SOMETHING

02:07:44.790 --> 02:07:45.624
THAT I THINK SHE MIGHT AGREE

02:07:45.691 --> 02:07:47.760
WITH. BUT WE KEEP EXPEDITING

02:07:47.826 --> 02:07:48.794
THINGS IN THE COURTS, AND I

02:07:48.861 --> 02:07:50.229
AGREE THIS SHOULD BE EXPEDITED,

02:07:50.295 --> 02:07:51.497
BUT I ALSO THINK IT JUST

02:07:51.563 --> 02:07:52.998
HIGHLIGHTS A MAJOR PROBLEM IN

02:07:53.065 --> 02:07:54.733
OUR COURTS. AND EVERY TIME WE

02:07:54.800 --> 02:07:56.402
FAST TRACK SOMETHING, IT MEANS

02:07:56.468 --> 02:07:57.836
SOMEBODY ELSE WHO NEEDS ACCESS

02:07:57.903 --> 02:07:58.837
TO JUSTICE IS BEING PUSHED

02:07:58.904 --> 02:08:00.639
FURTHER BACK IN LINE. AND SO I

02:08:00.706 --> 02:08:02.107
SUPPORT THE BILL. I'M HAPPY TO

02:08:02.174 --> 02:08:04.910
VOTE FOR IT. BUT I THINK IN

02:08:04.977 --> 02:08:06.311
ADDITION TO THIS, WE ALSO NEED

02:08:06.378 --> 02:08:06.945
TO MAKE SURE WE'RE WORKING ON

02:08:07.012 --> 02:08:08.781
GETTING OUR COURTS TO A PLACE

02:08:08.847 --> 02:08:10.282
WHERE EVERYONE HAS EXPEDITED

02:08:10.349 --> 02:08:10.916
ACCESS TO JUSTICE, BECAUSE THAT

02:08:10.983 --> 02:08:12.317
IS WHAT JUSTICE MEANS. SO THANK

02:08:12.384 --> 02:08:13.952
YOU. THANK YOU, MADAM VICE

02:08:14.019 --> 02:08:16.488
CHAIR. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR.

02:08:16.555 --> 02:08:18.991
YEAH, I'M OF TWO MINDS. I

02:08:19.058 --> 02:08:20.859
CERTAINLY AM A STRONG ADVOCATE

02:08:20.926 --> 02:08:22.428
FOR HOUSING. WE ALL KNOW THAT

02:08:22.494 --> 02:08:25.431
WITHOUT EVEN SPEAKING ABOUT IT.

02:08:25.497 --> 02:08:26.565
HOWEVER, AS LONG AS WE'VE BEEN

02:08:26.632 --> 02:08:28.133
SPEAKING ABOUT IT AND COMING

02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:29.368
FROM THE LOCAL PERSPECTIVE,

02:08:29.435 --> 02:08:30.769
SERVING ON CITY COUNCIL, WHEN

02:08:30.836 --> 02:08:32.304
ALL THESE BILLS STARTING IN

02:08:32.371 --> 02:08:34.406
2016, 17, 18, 19 TO THE PRESENT

02:08:34.473 --> 02:08:36.241
TIMES HAVE BEEN COMING AND

02:08:36.308 --> 02:08:37.943
STRIPPING AWAY LOCAL CONTROL, A

02:08:38.010 --> 02:08:40.579
LOT OF IT HAS ALREADY HAPPENED.

02:08:40.646 --> 02:08:44.850
TAKING AWAY LOCAL CONTROL. AND

02:08:44.917 --> 02:08:47.486
WHILE WE DO ALL THESE BILLS TO

02:08:47.553 --> 02:08:49.354
EXPEDITE, TO STRIP AWAY, TO GIVE

02:08:49.421 --> 02:08:51.490
POWER TO THE STATE, THE END OF

02:08:51.557 --> 02:08:53.592
THE DAY, THE ELEPHANT IN THE

02:08:53.659 --> 02:08:56.161
ROOM IS SEQUA. AND ONE OF THE

02:08:56.228 --> 02:08:57.796
SPEAKERS WERE TALKING ABOUT THE

02:08:57.863 --> 02:09:00.332
COSTLY LITIGATION. DEVELOPERS

02:09:00.399 --> 02:09:03.235
TODAY GO THROUGH EXTREMELY LONG

02:09:03.302 --> 02:09:05.003
DELAYS DEALING WITH CEQA, AND I

02:09:05.070 --> 02:09:07.840
THINK THIS IS A BIPARTISAN

02:09:07.906 --> 02:09:09.675
ISSUE. I KNOW A CERTAIN ASSEMBLY

02:09:09.741 --> 02:09:11.810
MEMBERS ALSO HAVE SPOKEN WHO

02:09:11.877 --> 02:09:12.678
HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE

02:09:12.744 --> 02:09:15.214
HOUSING ISSUE, HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT

02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:18.016
CEQA AND TO MY COLLEAGUE'S

02:09:18.083 --> 02:09:19.451
COMMENTS ABOUT THE COURT DELAYS.

02:09:19.518 --> 02:09:21.253
ALSO IN I THINK IN THE CURRENT

02:09:21.320 --> 02:09:22.488
BUDGET, SOMEONE COULD CORRECT ME

02:09:22.554 --> 02:09:25.524
IF I'M WRONG THAT THE JUDICIAL

02:09:25.591 --> 02:09:28.160
COUNCIL'S RECOMMENDATION FOR

02:09:28.227 --> 02:09:30.596
ADDITIONAL MANPOWER AND

02:09:30.662 --> 02:09:31.763
COURTROOMS HAS BEEN DENIED IN

02:09:31.830 --> 02:09:33.966
THE CURRENT BUDGET. SO WE'RE

02:09:34.032 --> 02:09:35.601
SQUEEZING THE COURT SYSTEM. AND

02:09:35.667 --> 02:09:39.138
THE REAL PROBLEM IS CEQA. AND I

02:09:39.204 --> 02:09:40.772
UNDERSTAND IF THERE'S A LAW THAT

02:09:40.839 --> 02:09:42.541
THE CITY SHOULD COMPLY. SO I'M

02:09:42.608 --> 02:09:44.943
I'M NOT DEFENDING CITIES,

02:09:45.010 --> 02:09:46.845
DISOBEYING THE LAW. BUT I THINK

02:09:46.912 --> 02:09:48.981
THE REAL PROBLEM BEING THRUST

02:09:49.047 --> 02:09:51.150
UPON CITIES IS THAT CEQA IS

02:09:51.216 --> 02:09:53.685
CREATING THE COST. CITIES ARE

02:09:53.752 --> 02:09:55.287
BEING BLAMED OR HELD RESPONSIBLE

02:09:55.354 --> 02:09:57.322
WHEN THE REAL COSTS FOR HOUSING

02:09:57.389 --> 02:10:00.893
AND THE STATISTICS EXIST TEN

02:10:00.959 --> 02:10:03.729
$20,000 PER HOUSING UNIT IS

02:10:03.795 --> 02:10:05.564
PASSED ON FROM A DEVELOPER AFTER

02:10:05.631 --> 02:10:07.599
HAVING SPENT YEARS AND YEARS AND

02:10:07.666 --> 02:10:09.234
YEARS AND YEARS IN COURT

02:10:09.301 --> 02:10:12.037
BATTLING CEQA. AND YET NOW THE

02:10:12.104 --> 02:10:13.839
CITIES ARE SAYING THEY'RE THE

02:10:13.906 --> 02:10:15.207
BAD GUYS BECAUSE THEY'RE SLOWING

02:10:15.274 --> 02:10:16.441
THINGS DOWN. I ACTUALLY THOUGHT

02:10:16.508 --> 02:10:18.310
IN ONE OF THESE LAWS THAT WERE

02:10:18.377 --> 02:10:20.679
PASSED DURING MY TIME ON THE

02:10:20.746 --> 02:10:22.314
CITY COUNCIL, I CAN'T REMEMBER

02:10:22.381 --> 02:10:23.282
WHAT YEAR IT WAS, BUT MAYBE THE

02:10:23.348 --> 02:10:25.951
LAST 6 OR 7 YEARS THAT THERE WAS

02:10:26.018 --> 02:10:27.152
A LIMIT PUT ON THE NUMBER OF

02:10:27.219 --> 02:10:28.921
HEARINGS THAT A HOUSING

02:10:28.987 --> 02:10:31.056
DEVELOPMENT COULD BE HEARD

02:10:31.123 --> 02:10:32.824
BEFORE A LOCAL AGENCY. SO THERE

02:10:32.891 --> 02:10:35.027
IS A CAP ON THE NUMBER OF

02:10:35.093 --> 02:10:36.361
HEARINGS, AND I THINK THERE IS A

02:10:36.428 --> 02:10:37.763
TIME PERIOD. SO I'M TRYING TO

02:10:37.829 --> 02:10:39.731
UNDERSTAND WHY WE'RE PUTTING

02:10:39.798 --> 02:10:42.034
LITTLE FIXES WHEN THE BIGGER

02:10:42.100 --> 02:10:45.837
PROBLEM IS CEQA, AS WELL AS THE,

02:10:45.904 --> 02:10:50.576
THE. PROBLEM. AND IT'S GOING TO

02:10:50.642 --> 02:10:51.810
OCCUR IN THE COURT SYSTEM.

02:10:51.877 --> 02:10:53.779
THAT'S VERY THAT MEANS A LOT TO

02:10:53.845 --> 02:10:55.614
ME BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT THE

02:10:55.681 --> 02:10:57.749
COURTS ARE OVERLOADED. SO I HAVE

02:10:57.816 --> 02:10:58.750
GREAT RESPECT FOR THE JUDICIAL

02:10:58.817 --> 02:11:00.552
COUNCIL'S POINT OF VIEW. SO I

02:11:00.619 --> 02:11:03.488
I'M TWO MINDS ON THIS. THE LOCAL

02:11:03.555 --> 02:11:04.890
CONTROL, THE COURTROOMS, THE

02:11:04.957 --> 02:11:06.358
CEQA ISSUES. I DON'T THINK THIS

02:11:06.425 --> 02:11:08.293
IS THE ANSWER TO WHAT WE NEED TO

02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:10.596
DO. AND I'M HEARING IT ALL THESE

02:11:10.662 --> 02:11:11.763
YEARS. I'M GETTING MORE BILLS,

02:11:11.830 --> 02:11:14.032
MORE BILLS, MORE BILLS, AND WE

02:11:14.099 --> 02:11:14.666
STILL HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS. WHY

02:11:14.733 --> 02:11:16.435
DON'T WE GET TO THE CORE OF THE

02:11:16.501 --> 02:11:18.403
PROBLEM? AND THAT'S MY COMMENT.

02:11:18.470 --> 02:11:20.005
SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU,

02:11:20.072 --> 02:11:23.208
ASSEMBLYMEMBER BRIAN. THANK YOU,

02:11:23.275 --> 02:11:28.247
MR. CHAIR. THERE'S A LOT TO

02:11:28.313 --> 02:11:31.316
UNPACK IN THAT. FIRST, I WANT TO

02:11:31.383 --> 02:11:32.618
THANK THE WITNESSES FOR BEING

02:11:32.684 --> 02:11:34.419
HERE. I FOUND IT PARTICULARLY

02:11:34.486 --> 02:11:36.188
COMPELLING. THE WITNESS WHO

02:11:36.255 --> 02:11:38.090
FORMERLY SERVED AS THE MAYOR OF

02:11:38.156 --> 02:11:41.360
CULVER CITY AND THE AND A GOOD

02:11:41.426 --> 02:11:43.862
FRIEND, LOCAL FRIEND, WAS ONE OF

02:11:43.929 --> 02:11:45.297
THE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT

02:11:45.364 --> 02:11:46.632
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION LAW WE

02:11:46.698 --> 02:11:49.468
HAVE ON THE BOOKS. IT HAS ALSO

02:11:49.534 --> 02:11:51.637
CAUSED DELAYS AT TIMES. AND YOU

02:11:51.703 --> 02:11:54.172
HAVE YOU HAVE SEEN NO TIME IN

02:11:54.239 --> 02:11:55.407
CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY WHEN

02:11:55.474 --> 02:11:56.441
THERE'S BEEN GREATER CEQA

02:11:56.508 --> 02:11:58.510
REFORM. THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO

02:11:58.577 --> 02:12:00.145
WITH CEQA. THIS HAS TO DO WITH

02:12:00.212 --> 02:12:02.147
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS DENYING

02:12:02.214 --> 02:12:04.416
IMPROPERLY USING EXISTING LAW TO

02:12:04.483 --> 02:12:06.084
STOP HOUSING THAT THEY ALSO

02:12:06.151 --> 02:12:07.586
DON'T WANT TO BUILD. THIS IS

02:12:07.653 --> 02:12:09.288
ABOUT BAD ACTORS AT THE LOCAL

02:12:09.354 --> 02:12:11.857
LEVEL AND DELAY TACTICS TO STALL

02:12:11.923 --> 02:12:13.759
OUT HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS

02:12:13.825 --> 02:12:16.161
AND PROVIDING EXPEDITED REVIEW.

02:12:16.228 --> 02:12:17.763
THAT'S IMPORTANT. THAT'S ONE OF

02:12:17.829 --> 02:12:19.831
THE MAIN TWEAKS WE DO TO CEQA AS

02:12:19.898 --> 02:12:21.199
EXPEDITED JUDICIAL REVIEW. SO IT

02:12:21.266 --> 02:12:23.468
CAN'T BE USED TO DELAY INCREASED

02:12:23.535 --> 02:12:25.237
COSTS OR STOP DEVELOPMENTS

02:12:25.304 --> 02:12:26.772
ALTOGETHER. THIS IS A SMART AND

02:12:26.838 --> 02:12:28.140
SENSIBLE BILL, AND I WANT TO

02:12:28.206 --> 02:12:29.274
THANK THE AUTHOR, WHO ALWAYS

02:12:29.341 --> 02:12:31.310
BRINGS SMART AND SENSIBLE BILLS.

02:12:31.376 --> 02:12:33.111
AND IF THERE'S NOT A MOTION, I'D

02:12:33.178 --> 02:12:35.414
BE HAPPY TO MAKE ONE. WE DO HAVE

02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:38.216
A MOTION, ASSEMBLYMAN PACHECO.

02:12:38.283 --> 02:12:40.085
THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU,

02:12:40.152 --> 02:12:41.119
SENATOR, FOR BRINGING THIS BILL

02:12:41.186 --> 02:12:42.954
FORWARD. I DO UNDERSTAND, AND I

02:12:43.021 --> 02:12:45.524
COULD BE CORRECTED. JUDICIAL

02:12:45.590 --> 02:12:48.160
COUNCIL JUST RECENTLY SUBMITTED

02:12:48.226 --> 02:12:49.828
THEIR OPPOSITION LETTER. RIGHT.

02:12:49.895 --> 02:12:51.797
IT WASN'T SUBMITTED IN THE

02:12:51.863 --> 02:12:54.433
SENATE. AND IS THAT CORRECT? I

02:12:54.499 --> 02:12:55.567
DON'T KNOW IF THE OPPOSITION

02:12:55.634 --> 02:12:58.036
WANTS TO CHIME IN THROUGH THE

02:12:58.103 --> 02:13:01.907
CHAIR. I BELIEVE WE SUBMITTED IN

02:13:01.973 --> 02:13:03.075
APPROPRIATIONS IN THE FIRST

02:13:03.141 --> 02:13:04.743
HOUSE. YEAH, WE WE'VE HAD

02:13:04.810 --> 02:13:06.345
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS FOR A

02:13:06.411 --> 02:13:07.746
WHILE, BUT I DON'T REMEMBER IF

02:13:07.813 --> 02:13:09.147
THERE WAS A LETTER TO TELL YOU

02:13:09.214 --> 02:13:11.616
THE TRUTH. BUT BUT WE KNEW THAT

02:13:11.683 --> 02:13:12.751
THERE WAS OPPOSITION BY THE

02:13:12.818 --> 02:13:15.821
JUDICIAL COUNCIL. AND WITH ALL

02:13:15.887 --> 02:13:18.156
DUE RESPECT TO THE JUDICIAL

02:13:18.223 --> 02:13:20.759
COUNCIL, THEY ALWAYS OBJECT TO

02:13:20.826 --> 02:13:23.895
EVERY EXPEDITED REVIEW. SO IT'S

02:13:23.962 --> 02:13:25.297
KIND OF LIKE PAR FOR THE COURSE,

02:13:25.364 --> 02:13:27.132
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, REALLY,

02:13:27.199 --> 02:13:29.334
HONESTLY, BECAUSE I ALSO

02:13:29.401 --> 02:13:33.772
RECOGNIZE THAT THAT. IN DURING

02:13:33.839 --> 02:13:35.440
TOUGH BUDGET TIMES, IT'S EASY TO

02:13:35.507 --> 02:13:37.209
SAY NO TO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL

02:13:37.275 --> 02:13:39.344
AS OPPOSED TO, YOU KNOW, FEEDING

02:13:39.411 --> 02:13:41.113
PEOPLE AND MAKING SURE KIDS GET

02:13:41.179 --> 02:13:42.481
TO SCHOOL AND ALL THAT KIND OF

02:13:42.547 --> 02:13:45.083
GOOD STUFF. SO I, I REALLY DO

02:13:45.150 --> 02:13:46.952
RESPECT THE POSITION, WHICH IS

02:13:47.018 --> 02:13:49.821
THAT THEY NEED RESOURCES. AND I

02:13:49.888 --> 02:13:51.022
COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT. AND

02:13:51.089 --> 02:13:52.591
I THINK FROM READING THE

02:13:52.657 --> 02:13:54.526
ANALYSIS, THERE'S A WAY TO GET

02:13:54.593 --> 02:13:57.429
TO A POINT WHERE THE COURTS

02:13:57.496 --> 02:14:00.165
WOULD BE OKAY WITH THIS BILL. SO

02:14:00.232 --> 02:14:02.000
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE

02:14:02.067 --> 02:14:02.768
CONVERSATIONS THAT YOU HAVE WITH

02:14:02.834 --> 02:14:04.636
JUDICIAL COUNCIL, ESPECIALLY

02:14:04.703 --> 02:14:07.873
SINCE THEY'RE, YOU KNOW, LATE IN

02:14:07.939 --> 02:14:09.408
SUBMITTING A LETTER, MAYBE AN

02:14:09.474 --> 02:14:11.810
APPROACH IN THE SENATE. SO I'M

02:14:11.877 --> 02:14:13.211
LOOKING FORWARD TO THE

02:14:13.278 --> 02:14:14.613
CONVERSATIONS THAT WILL BE HELD.

02:14:14.679 --> 02:14:16.448
LOOK, LOOKING FORWARD TO THE

02:14:16.515 --> 02:14:19.117
FINAL VERSION OF THIS BILL AND I

02:14:19.184 --> 02:14:19.718
WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY.

02:14:19.785 --> 02:14:22.020
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU,

02:14:22.087 --> 02:14:22.988
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. ANY OTHER

02:14:23.054 --> 02:14:25.490
QUESTION OR COMMENT? I WANT TO

02:14:25.557 --> 02:14:26.725
THANK YOU, SENATOR, FOR BRINGING

02:14:26.792 --> 02:14:28.760
THIS FORWARD. AND I'M DEFINITELY

02:14:28.827 --> 02:14:29.795
SENSITIVE TO THE CONCERNS FROM

02:14:29.861 --> 02:14:31.296
JUDICIAL COUNCIL. YOU KNOW,

02:14:31.363 --> 02:14:34.132
WHENEVER ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ADD

02:14:34.199 --> 02:14:35.534
EXPEDITED PROCESSES, IT DOES

02:14:35.600 --> 02:14:37.369
REQUIRE RESOURCES. AT THE SAME

02:14:37.436 --> 02:14:38.937
TIME, THEY'RE GOING TO BE I

02:14:39.004 --> 02:14:41.573
GUESS, OTHER THE SOME OF THE

02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:43.175
CASES THAT MAY MAY HAVE BEEN

02:14:43.241 --> 02:14:44.910
EXTENDED FOR MANY MONTHS OR

02:14:44.976 --> 02:14:46.344
YEARS, BUT ALSO, I GUESS, REDUCE

02:14:46.411 --> 02:14:49.181
SOME OF THE WORK IN THE COURTS

02:14:49.247 --> 02:14:51.416
ON THE BACK END. BUT IT'S THAT

02:14:51.483 --> 02:14:52.417
SHORT END COST OF MAKING SURE

02:14:52.484 --> 02:14:55.754
THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH JUDGES AND

02:14:55.821 --> 02:14:57.355
COURT STAFF TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE

02:14:57.422 --> 02:14:59.458
IT. AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO

02:14:59.524 --> 02:15:00.659
CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS THERE.

02:15:00.725 --> 02:15:02.861
AT THE END OF THE DAY, THERE'S

02:15:02.928 --> 02:15:03.495
ONLY THERE'S A LIMITATION AS TO

02:15:03.562 --> 02:15:06.031
WHAT THE COURTS CAN DO UNLESS WE

02:15:06.097 --> 02:15:07.432
GIVE THEM MORE RESOURCES

02:15:07.499 --> 02:15:09.334
COLLECTIVELY. AND I THINK ALL OF

02:15:09.401 --> 02:15:10.302
US SUPPORT DOING THAT. IT'S JUST

02:15:10.368 --> 02:15:12.437
HOW DO WE DO IT IN THE BUDGET

02:15:12.504 --> 02:15:13.371
ENVIRONMENT? WE HAVE TO, I

02:15:13.438 --> 02:15:15.207
THINK, ALWAYS UNDERSTAND THAT

02:15:15.273 --> 02:15:18.643
THE COURT SYSTEM IS NOT A

02:15:18.710 --> 02:15:21.046
DEPARTMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT OR

02:15:21.112 --> 02:15:23.381
THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. IT'S A

02:15:23.448 --> 02:15:24.516
SEPARATE BRANCH OF THE

02:15:24.583 --> 02:15:26.284
GOVERNMENT THAT WE NEED TO BE

02:15:26.351 --> 02:15:28.320
VERY RESPECTFUL OF IN TERMS OF

02:15:28.386 --> 02:15:28.753
ENSURING THAT WE'RE

02:15:28.820 --> 02:15:29.621
APPROPRIATELY FUNDING SO THAT

02:15:29.688 --> 02:15:30.989
SOME OF THE IMPORTANT WORK

02:15:31.056 --> 02:15:33.391
THAT'S BEING DONE BY, BY YOU AND

02:15:33.458 --> 02:15:35.393
OTHERS CAN BE DONE IN A WAY THAT

02:15:35.460 --> 02:15:37.762
WE INTEND. WOULD YOU LIKE TO

02:15:37.829 --> 02:15:39.698
CLOSE? YES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH,

02:15:39.764 --> 02:15:42.968
MR. CHAIR. I APPRECIATE ALL THE

02:15:43.034 --> 02:15:45.337
COMMENTS. I IT IS MY HOPE AND

02:15:45.403 --> 02:15:50.375
YOU KNOW ONE. WHEN YOU CREATE A

02:15:50.442 --> 02:15:52.010
SOLUTION THAT'S GOING TO

02:15:52.077 --> 02:15:55.947
EXPEDITE A PROCESS, THE FIRST

02:15:56.014 --> 02:15:57.315
FEW CASES THAT GO THROUGH ARE

02:15:57.382 --> 02:15:59.050
THE PAINFUL ONES. AND AFTER

02:15:59.117 --> 02:16:01.319
THAT, I BELIEVE THAT THE CITIES

02:16:01.386 --> 02:16:02.954
AND THE COUNTIES ARE GOING TO

02:16:03.021 --> 02:16:04.422
RECOGNIZE THAT WITH AN EXPEDITED

02:16:04.489 --> 02:16:05.690
PROCESS, THEY MIGHT AS WELL MOVE

02:16:05.757 --> 02:16:06.858
THINGS ALONG, BECAUSE OTHERWISE

02:16:06.925 --> 02:16:08.460
YOU'RE PAYING EXPENSIVE

02:16:08.527 --> 02:16:12.364
LITIGATION DEFENSES THAT THAT

02:16:12.430 --> 02:16:15.634
WILL IMPACT. I MEAN, I THINK THE

02:16:15.700 --> 02:16:17.435
IMPACT ON THE COURT IS NOT GOING

02:16:17.502 --> 02:16:19.304
TO BE AS BAD AS THEY THINK IT'S

02:16:19.371 --> 02:16:21.306
GOING TO BE. BUT BUT I ALSO

02:16:21.373 --> 02:16:22.974
RECOGNIZE THAT WE NEED TO FUND

02:16:23.041 --> 02:16:24.776
THEM. AND IT MAY MAKE SENSE TO

02:16:24.843 --> 02:16:26.077
PUT A SPECIAL CADRE OF JUDGES

02:16:26.144 --> 02:16:28.747
THAT HAVE EXPERTISE IN HOUSING

02:16:28.813 --> 02:16:29.748
LAW, BECAUSE THE CHALLENGE IS,

02:16:29.814 --> 02:16:31.449
IS YOU'VE GOT TO COME UP TO

02:16:31.516 --> 02:16:32.984
SPEED WITH WHAT THE HOUSING LAW

02:16:33.051 --> 02:16:34.653
SAYS IN ORDER TO EVALUATE

02:16:34.719 --> 02:16:36.888
WHETHER THEY'RE THE CITY OR THE

02:16:36.955 --> 02:16:38.356
COUNTY IS BEING RECALCITRANT AND

02:16:38.423 --> 02:16:40.125
NOT FOLLOWING THE LAW IN, IN

02:16:40.191 --> 02:16:42.260
THEIR PROCESSES. SO IT'S MY

02:16:42.327 --> 02:16:43.962
BELIEF THAT IT WON'T IT WILL

02:16:44.029 --> 02:16:45.797
NOT. THERE WILL NOT BE AS MANY

02:16:45.864 --> 02:16:49.034
CASES AS, AS PROJECTED BY THE

02:16:49.100 --> 02:16:52.637
JUDICIAL COUNCIL. THANK YOU.

02:16:52.704 --> 02:16:54.072

02:22:31.910 --> 02:22:33.344
GROUP BEHIND THE DOX, WHICH WAS

02:22:33.411 --> 02:22:34.746
NEVER CAUGHT, CONTINUED TO

02:22:34.812 --> 02:22:36.281
SPREAD THIS INFORMATION ONLINE

02:22:36.347 --> 02:22:38.283
WITH POSTS LIKE, QUOTE, THESE

02:22:38.349 --> 02:22:39.384
PEOPLE ARE FINALLY LEARNING. WE

02:22:39.450 --> 02:22:40.818
DON'T WANT TO SEE THEIR

02:22:40.885 --> 02:22:42.287
DEGENERATE AND HOMOSEXUAL

02:22:42.353 --> 02:22:44.856
IDEOLOGY ANYMORE, UNQUOTE.

02:22:44.923 --> 02:22:46.591
CONCLUDING EACH POST WITH QUOTE

02:22:46.658 --> 02:22:49.394
F. THEY EVEN ESCALATED TO

02:22:49.460 --> 02:22:51.596
SENDING THINGS TO MY HOME. THE

02:22:51.663 --> 02:22:53.431
DAY THAT I RECEIVED MY COURT

02:22:53.498 --> 02:22:54.499
APPROVED NAME CHANGE WAS ONE OF

02:22:54.565 --> 02:22:56.668
THE BEST DAYS OF MY LIFE. BEING

02:22:56.734 --> 02:22:58.136
ABLE TO UPDATE MY IDS AND MY

02:22:58.202 --> 02:22:59.804
VOTER REGISTRATION WAS AN

02:22:59.871 --> 02:23:02.006
INCREDIBLE FREEDOM. SINCE I WAS

02:23:02.073 --> 02:23:04.175
DOXED, THAT JOY HAS BEEN TAINTED

02:23:04.242 --> 02:23:06.077
WITH FEAR AND CONCERN FOR MY

02:23:06.144 --> 02:23:09.514
SAFETY. PLEASE PASS SB, SB 59

02:23:09.580 --> 02:23:11.049
AND HELP OTHER TRANS PEOPLE BE

02:23:11.115 --> 02:23:13.184
SAFE FROM EXPERIENCES LIKE MINE.

02:23:13.251 --> 02:23:14.686
AT A TIME WHEN THE TRANSGENDER

02:23:14.752 --> 02:23:16.054
COMMUNITY IS UNDER ATTACK,

02:23:16.120 --> 02:23:17.288
ALLOWING TRANS PEOPLE TO CHOOSE

02:23:17.355 --> 02:23:19.590
WHEN AND HOW THEY DECIDE TO

02:23:19.657 --> 02:23:20.425
SHARE THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION

02:23:20.491 --> 02:23:22.593
IS VITAL TO PROTECT THEIR SAFETY

02:23:22.660 --> 02:23:23.394
AND WELL-BEING. WE ALL HAVE A

02:23:23.461 --> 02:23:25.029
RIGHT TO BASIC DIGNITY AND

02:23:25.096 --> 02:23:27.732
PRIVACY. THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

02:23:27.799 --> 02:23:29.734
GOOD MORNING, MISTER CHAIR.

02:23:29.801 --> 02:23:32.236
JONATHAN CLAY HERE. THIS ON.

02:23:32.303 --> 02:23:34.372

TO BE CO-SPONSORS ON SB 59.

02:23:42.280 --> 02:23:43.414
SENATOR WIENER AND CONAN DID A

02:23:43.481 --> 02:23:45.249
GREAT JOB OF HIGHLIGHTING THE

02:23:45.316 --> 02:23:46.584
ISSUES FACING TRANSGENDER PEOPLE

02:23:46.651 --> 02:23:48.353
THESE DAYS. AND I'D LIKE TO KIND

02:23:48.419 --> 02:23:50.955
OF GET INTO THE WEEDS A LITTLE

02:23:51.022 --> 02:23:52.390
BIT ABOUT WHY HAVING THE CHANGES

02:23:52.457 --> 02:23:54.192
EMBODIED IN SB 59 ARE SO

02:23:54.258 --> 02:23:56.561
IMPORTANT, ESPECIALLY FOR OUR

02:23:56.627 --> 02:23:58.529
THE FAMILIES THAT ARE USING THE

02:23:58.596 --> 02:24:00.732
SERVICES OF TRANS FAMILY SUPPORT

02:24:00.798 --> 02:24:02.533
SERVICES. AS SENATOR WIENER

02:24:02.600 --> 02:24:03.634
MENTIONED, THE LEGISLATURE

02:24:03.701 --> 02:24:07.972
PASSED HB TWO TWO 3 IN 2023,

02:24:08.039 --> 02:24:08.973
PROVIDING LEVELS OF

02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:10.475
CONFIDENTIALITY AND PROTECTION

02:24:10.541 --> 02:24:12.543
FOR THOSE YOUTH GOING THROUGH

02:24:12.610 --> 02:24:14.112
NAME AND GENDER CHANGE. THIS WAS

02:24:14.178 --> 02:24:15.313
BECAUSE OF THE THREATS THOSE

02:24:15.380 --> 02:24:17.482
PEOPLE WERE FACING, AS WELL AS

02:24:17.548 --> 02:24:18.616
FAMILIES WANTING TO PROTECT

02:24:18.683 --> 02:24:21.085
THEIR OWN PRIVACY. ONE OF THE

02:24:21.152 --> 02:24:22.387
ISSUES BEING ADDRESSED IN SB 59

02:24:22.453 --> 02:24:24.455
IS THAT ANYONE THAT WENT THROUGH

02:24:24.522 --> 02:24:26.190
THIS PROCESS PRIOR TO AB 223

02:24:26.257 --> 02:24:27.792
BECOMING LAW DON'T HAVE THOSE

02:24:27.859 --> 02:24:29.594
SAME PROTECTIONS, THE

02:24:29.660 --> 02:24:30.661
LEGISLATURE SAID. THIS IS THE

02:24:30.728 --> 02:24:32.563
POLICY OF THE STATE, BUT YET A

02:24:32.630 --> 02:24:34.232
WHOLE CLASS OF PEOPLE DON'T HAVE

02:24:34.298 --> 02:24:36.000
THOSE PROTECTIONS OR AN EASY WAY

02:24:36.067 --> 02:24:38.903
TO BE ABLE TO GET THOSE. IF YOU

02:24:38.970 --> 02:24:42.640
WANT TO TRY AND GET

02:24:42.707 --> 02:24:43.274
CONFIDENTIALITY FOR A NAME AND

02:24:43.341 --> 02:24:44.509
GENDER CHANGE THAT HAPPENED

02:24:44.575 --> 02:24:47.578
BEFORE 223 TOOK EFFECT, YOU HAVE

02:24:47.645 --> 02:24:49.047
TO BASICALLY HIRE ATTORNEY, GO

02:24:49.113 --> 02:24:50.348
THROUGH THE COURT PROCESS, HAVE

02:24:50.415 --> 02:24:52.617
A HEARING BEFORE A JUDGE. THIS

02:24:52.683 --> 02:24:54.485
IS AN EXPENSIVE AND DIFFICULT

02:24:54.552 --> 02:24:56.788
PROCESS TO NAVIGATE. IF YOU

02:24:56.854 --> 02:24:58.356
DON'T HAVE THE EXPERIENCE IN SB

02:24:58.423 --> 02:25:00.158
59 IS ATTEMPTING TO BRING THE

02:25:00.224 --> 02:25:02.160
SAME LEVEL OF MINISTERIAL

02:25:02.226 --> 02:25:03.528
ACTIONS THAT WERE DONE FOR TWO,

02:25:03.594 --> 02:25:05.430
TWO, THREE TO ANYONE THAT WENT

02:25:05.496 --> 02:25:08.800
THROUGH THAT PROCESS PRIOR AND

02:25:08.866 --> 02:25:10.201
SPECIFIC TO THE CURRENT COURT

02:25:10.268 --> 02:25:11.636
PROCESS. WE'VE HAD FAMILIES GO

02:25:11.702 --> 02:25:13.838
THROUGH THE PROCESS IN THE SAME

02:25:13.905 --> 02:25:15.540
REGIONAL COURT, BUT YET HAVE HAD

02:25:15.606 --> 02:25:16.774
DIFFERENT OUTCOMES, EVEN THOUGH

02:25:16.841 --> 02:25:18.042
THEY'VE HAD THE SAME DOCUMENTS

02:25:18.109 --> 02:25:20.511
BASED ON JUST THE JUDGE. AND YOU

02:25:20.578 --> 02:25:23.114
KNOW HOW THAT PROCESS GOES. SO

02:25:23.181 --> 02:25:25.650
SB 59 WOULD ALSO THEN BE ABLE TO

02:25:25.716 --> 02:25:28.953
BRING KIND OF A EQUALIZING OF

02:25:29.020 --> 02:25:29.520
HOW PEOPLE EXPERIENCE GOING

02:25:29.587 --> 02:25:33.624
THROUGH THAT PROCESS. HAPPY TO

02:25:33.691 --> 02:25:35.393
ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR

02:25:35.460 --> 02:25:36.494
ABOUT THE PROCESS. THANK YOU.

02:25:36.561 --> 02:25:38.396

FOR THE ACLU, CURRENT MEMBER OF

OUR DUTY AND A MEMBER OF THE GAY

02:27:20.731 --> 02:27:23.367
COMMUNITY. SB 59 AUTOMATICALLY

02:27:23.434 --> 02:27:25.136
SEALS SEX MARKER AND NAME

02:27:25.203 --> 02:27:27.605
CHANGES BOTH PROSPECTIVELY AND

02:27:27.672 --> 02:27:28.506
RETROACTIVELY, WHILE IMPOSING

02:27:28.573 --> 02:27:30.975
SEVERE PENALTIES OF AT LEAST

02:27:31.042 --> 02:27:32.710
$5,000 PLUS ATTORNEY'S FEES ON

02:27:32.777 --> 02:27:35.279
ANYONE WHO DISCLOSES THIS

02:27:35.346 --> 02:27:36.581
INFORMATION, EVEN WITHOUT A

02:27:36.647 --> 02:27:38.482
SHOWING OF ACTUAL HARM. THE BILL

02:27:38.549 --> 02:27:40.051
THIS BILL VIOLATES THE FIRST

02:27:40.117 --> 02:27:41.385
AMENDMENT. JUDICIAL RECORDS ARE

02:27:41.452 --> 02:27:43.321
PRESUMPTIVELY PUBLIC COURTS SEAL

02:27:43.387 --> 02:27:45.189
THEM ONLY IN RARE CIRCUMSTANCES.

02:27:45.256 --> 02:27:47.725
AFTER CAREFUL REVIEW, SB 59

02:27:47.792 --> 02:27:49.627
CREATES A BLANKET DISCLOSURE BAN

02:27:49.694 --> 02:27:51.028
WITHOUT ANY COURT FINDING THIS

02:27:51.095 --> 02:27:53.564
IS BLATANTLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

02:27:53.631 --> 02:27:54.899
THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES THAT

02:27:54.966 --> 02:27:56.467
THE SEALING OF PUBLIC RECORDS

02:27:56.534 --> 02:27:58.502
SERVE A COMPELLING INTEREST

02:27:58.569 --> 02:28:01.572
THROUGH NARROWLY TAILORED MEANS.

02:28:01.639 --> 02:28:02.773
UNDER THIS BILL, NEITHER OF

02:28:02.840 --> 02:28:04.308
THOSE REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE

02:28:04.375 --> 02:28:06.644
FULFILLED. THE PREMISE OF THIS

02:28:06.711 --> 02:28:09.113
BILL IS ALSO FAULTY. IN 2023,

02:28:09.180 --> 02:28:11.315
ONLY TWO OF THE 26 TRANS

02:28:11.382 --> 02:28:12.316
IDENTIFIED MURDER VICTIMS WERE

02:28:12.383 --> 02:28:14.185
KILLED BECAUSE OF THEIR

02:28:14.252 --> 02:28:15.253
IDENTIFICATION AS TRANS,

02:28:15.319 --> 02:28:18.122
ACCORDING TO THE FBI. MEANWHILE,

02:28:18.189 --> 02:28:19.490
A SINGLE TRANS IDENTIFIED

02:28:19.557 --> 02:28:20.591
INDIVIDUAL, AUDREY HALE,

02:28:20.658 --> 02:28:22.493
MURDERED SIX PEOPLE, INCLUDING

02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:23.527
THREE CHILDREN, AT A CHRISTIAN

02:28:23.594 --> 02:28:25.496
SCHOOL. CHRISTIANS FACE HATE

02:28:25.563 --> 02:28:27.865
CRIMES AT FOUR TIMES THE RATE OF

02:28:27.932 --> 02:28:30.001
TRANS IDENTIFIED PEOPLE. THE

02:28:30.067 --> 02:28:31.269
PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THIS

02:28:31.335 --> 02:28:33.671
BILL ARE SEVERE. WOMEN FIGHTING

02:28:33.738 --> 02:28:35.072
FOR TITLE NINE PROTECTIONS WOULD

02:28:35.139 --> 02:28:36.974
NOT BE ABLE TO PRESENT CRUCIAL

02:28:37.041 --> 02:28:38.476
EVIDENCE. RESEARCHERS WOULDN'T

02:28:38.542 --> 02:28:41.178
BE ABLE TO STUDY POLICY IMPACTS.

02:28:41.245 --> 02:28:42.913
LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATIONS

02:28:42.980 --> 02:28:44.649
WOULD BE COMPROMISED. CHILDREN

02:28:44.715 --> 02:28:46.517
COULD BE FOREVER LOST TO

02:28:46.584 --> 02:28:47.184
TRAFFICKERS WITH THEIR

02:28:47.251 --> 02:28:50.087
IDENTITIES ERASED. THIS BILL

02:28:50.154 --> 02:28:50.688
PRIORITIZES POLITICAL THEATER

02:28:50.755 --> 02:28:53.157
OVER TRANSPARENCY,

02:28:53.224 --> 02:28:54.892
ACCOUNTABILITY, AND PUBLIC

02:28:54.959 --> 02:28:58.195
SAFETY. VOTE NO ON SB 59. THANK

02:28:58.262 --> 02:29:02.433
YOU. MY TURN. YES. OKAY. MY NAME

02:29:02.500 --> 02:29:04.869
IS LILA JANE. I'M A CALIFORNIA

02:29:04.935 --> 02:29:06.470
DETRANSITIONERS ONE OF THOUSANDS

02:29:06.537 --> 02:29:08.839
SB 59 IS BASED UPON A FALSE

02:29:08.906 --> 02:29:10.141
PREMISE. NO HUMAN HAS EVER

02:29:10.207 --> 02:29:11.776
CHANGED OR WILL EVER CHANGE SEX,

02:29:11.842 --> 02:29:13.411
AND A PIECE OF PAPER, EVEN ONE

02:29:13.477 --> 02:29:14.445
FILED WITH THE GOVERNMENT WILL

02:29:14.512 --> 02:29:17.048
NOT ALTER THAT FACT. THE UK'S

02:29:17.114 --> 02:29:18.316
HIGHEST COURT HAS UNANIMOUSLY

02:29:18.382 --> 02:29:20.151
RULED THAT WAY AS WELL. OUR

02:29:20.217 --> 02:29:22.019
SUPREME COURT SOON. IT TURNS OUT

02:29:22.086 --> 02:29:23.587
THAT TRANS WOMEN ARE MALES AND

02:29:23.654 --> 02:29:25.323
TRANS MEN ARE FEMALES. I KNOW

02:29:25.389 --> 02:29:27.091
THIS FIRSTHAND. WHEN I WAS 11

02:29:27.158 --> 02:29:28.926
YEARS OLD, I WAS CONVINCED BY

02:29:28.993 --> 02:29:30.361
ALL MY MEDICAL PROVIDERS THAT I

02:29:30.428 --> 02:29:32.797
COULD BECOME A BOY. ALL I NEEDED

02:29:32.863 --> 02:29:34.131
WAS PUBERTY BLOCKERS, HORMONES,

02:29:34.198 --> 02:29:35.766
AND TO CHOP MY BREASTS OFF AND

02:29:35.833 --> 02:29:38.135
PRESTO, I WOULD BE A REAL BOY.

02:29:38.202 --> 02:29:39.070
JUST LIKE IN THE STORY OF

02:29:39.136 --> 02:29:40.438
PINOCCHIO, I FOLLOWED THE

02:29:40.504 --> 02:29:41.439
DOCTOR'S ADVICE. I ENDURED

02:29:41.505 --> 02:29:43.107
MENOPAUSE AS A CHILD, THICKENED

02:29:43.174 --> 02:29:44.742
MY VOCAL CORDS, IRREVERSIBLY,

02:29:44.809 --> 02:29:46.243
GREW HAIR LIKE A MALE, BROADENED

02:29:46.310 --> 02:29:48.112
MY SHOULDERS AND WREAKED HAVOC

02:29:48.179 --> 02:29:50.514
ON MY UTERUS. AND FINALLY, MY

02:29:50.581 --> 02:29:51.749
HEALTHY BREASTS WERE AMPUTATED

02:29:51.816 --> 02:29:53.517
JUST AFTER I TURNED 13, LEAVING

02:29:53.584 --> 02:29:55.252
ME WITH PHANTOM PAIN AND

02:29:55.319 --> 02:29:56.854
NUMBNESS. I MIGHT NEVER BE ABLE

02:29:56.921 --> 02:29:58.422
TO CARRY A CHILD, AND I

02:29:58.489 --> 02:29:59.290
CERTAINLY WON'T BE ABLE TO

02:29:59.357 --> 02:30:01.258
BREASTFEED ONE. LOOK AT ME. AM I

02:30:01.325 --> 02:30:03.828
A MAN? OF COURSE NOT. I AM A

02:30:03.894 --> 02:30:05.429
WOMAN WHOSE BODY IS MARKED WITH

02:30:05.496 --> 02:30:07.865
THE SCARS OF A LIE. EVEN IF I

02:30:07.932 --> 02:30:09.300
KEPT INJECTING THOSE SYRINGES OF

02:30:09.367 --> 02:30:09.900
TESTOSTERONE INTO MY BODY, I

02:30:09.967 --> 02:30:12.470
WOULD NEVER CHANGE SEX. SB 59

02:30:12.536 --> 02:30:13.904
PERPETUATES THIS LIE. THE LIE

02:30:13.971 --> 02:30:15.773
THAT NOT ONLY HURTS KIDS AND

02:30:15.840 --> 02:30:17.041
WOMEN, BUT THOSE WHO MAY SPEND

02:30:17.108 --> 02:30:18.442
THEIR LIVES WAKING UP EVERY DAY

02:30:18.509 --> 02:30:21.145
TO DON A COSTUME, HOPING THAT NO

02:30:21.212 --> 02:30:22.413
ONE CLOCKS THEM AS A SEX THEY

02:30:22.480 --> 02:30:24.682
TRULY ARE AND ALWAYS WILL BE.

02:30:24.749 --> 02:30:25.483
VOTE NO ON SB 59. GOVERNMENTS

02:30:25.549 --> 02:30:27.118
SHOULD NOT COLLUDE WITH A LIE.

02:30:27.184 --> 02:30:30.087
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IS THERE

THANK THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL.

02:32:08.385 --> 02:32:10.120
YOU KNOW, THIS IS INCREDIBLY,

02:32:10.187 --> 02:32:14.091
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. I HEAR

02:32:14.158 --> 02:32:16.961
EVERY WEEK FROM PEOPLE IN THE

02:32:17.027 --> 02:32:18.829
LGBTQ COMMUNITY MORE BROADLY,

02:32:18.896 --> 02:32:22.099
AND TRANS PEOPLE AND PARENTS AND

02:32:22.166 --> 02:32:25.469
KIDS, AND IN PARTICULAR, ABOUT

02:32:25.536 --> 02:32:27.771
THE EXTREME LEVEL OF FEAR THAT

02:32:27.838 --> 02:32:31.742
THEY ARE LIVING IN NOW AND AT A

02:32:31.809 --> 02:32:34.678
LEVEL THAT I HAVE NEVER SEEN IN

02:32:34.745 --> 02:32:37.481
MY LIFETIME. YOU KNOW, THE SAD

02:32:37.548 --> 02:32:39.450
THING IS THAT I'M NOT SURPRISED

02:32:39.517 --> 02:32:42.386
BY THE STORY THAT YOU CONVEYED

02:32:42.453 --> 02:32:44.288
NOW. AND I JUST WANT TO THANK

02:32:44.355 --> 02:32:45.789
YOU FOR YOUR BRAVERY IN COMING

02:32:45.856 --> 02:32:47.224
FORTH AND TELLING THAT STORY.

02:32:47.291 --> 02:32:48.659
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, THAT'S A

02:32:48.726 --> 02:32:50.661
STORY THAT MANY TRANS PEOPLE ARE

02:32:50.728 --> 02:32:54.298
ABLE TO TELL. NOW, MANY OF US

02:32:54.365 --> 02:32:58.769
WHO ARE IN THIS COMMUNITY

02:32:58.836 --> 02:33:02.640
UNDERSTAND THE RISK OF DOXING OF

02:33:02.706 --> 02:33:04.308
PEOPLE, ANYONE WHO'S HIGH

02:33:04.375 --> 02:33:07.444
PROFILE, I THINK HAS HAS FACED

02:33:07.511 --> 02:33:10.247
AT CERTAIN TIMES DEATH THREATS

02:33:10.314 --> 02:33:12.783
BECAUSE OF THEIR LGBTQ AND IN

02:33:12.850 --> 02:33:15.219
PARTICULAR TRANS STATUS. THIS IS

02:33:15.286 --> 02:33:17.588
AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO

02:33:17.655 --> 02:33:19.356
MAINTAIN THE SAFETY OF TRANS

02:33:19.423 --> 02:33:21.392
PEOPLE. NOW, IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT

02:33:21.458 --> 02:33:22.793
TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE CAN GET

02:33:22.860 --> 02:33:25.529
THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED IN

02:33:25.596 --> 02:33:27.031
JUST NORMAL LIFE. I MEAN, WE'RE

02:33:27.097 --> 02:33:28.966
SEEING HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS

02:33:29.033 --> 02:33:32.036
SHUT DOWN GENDER AFFIRMING CARE

02:33:32.102 --> 02:33:34.572
BECAUSE OF THE PRACTICE AREAS

02:33:34.638 --> 02:33:35.940
ARE BEING SHUT DOWN BECAUSE OF

02:33:36.006 --> 02:33:38.409
THE FOCUS OF THE FEDERAL

02:33:38.475 --> 02:33:39.243
GOVERNMENT IN SHUTTING THESE

02:33:39.310 --> 02:33:41.712
THINGS DOWN. THOSE FOLKS NEED TO

02:33:41.779 --> 02:33:43.447
FIND OTHER KINDS OF CARE

02:33:43.514 --> 02:33:46.150
GENERALLY IN AT INSTITUTIONS

02:33:46.216 --> 02:33:47.451
WHERE THAT'S NOT FOCUSED. AND

02:33:47.518 --> 02:33:50.621
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THAT

02:33:50.688 --> 02:33:52.423
THEY'RE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THE

02:33:52.489 --> 02:33:53.757
PRIVACY THAT THEY NEED TO OBTAIN

02:33:53.824 --> 02:33:56.660
THE SERVICES, THAT SERVICES THAT

02:33:56.727 --> 02:33:58.829
WE ALL NEED. YOU KNOW, MEDICAL

02:33:58.896 --> 02:34:02.499
CARE, BEING ABLE TO RENT, RENT A

02:34:02.566 --> 02:34:04.735
HOUSE, BUY A HOUSE, I MEAN,

02:34:04.802 --> 02:34:06.837
EVERYTHING THAT, YOU KNOW, WE'RE

02:34:06.904 --> 02:34:09.306
HEADING INTO, WE ARE IN A PERIOD

02:34:09.373 --> 02:34:11.375
NOW WHERE THE FEDERAL

02:34:11.442 --> 02:34:13.277
GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY IS TO TRY

02:34:13.344 --> 02:34:16.480
TO RACE TRANS PEOPLE, AND WE

02:34:16.547 --> 02:34:19.083
NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO

02:34:19.149 --> 02:34:20.250
PROTECT THEM. SO I JUST WANT TO

02:34:20.317 --> 02:34:22.419
THANK THE AUTHOR. I WANT TO

02:34:22.486 --> 02:34:24.421
THANK THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL.

02:34:24.488 --> 02:34:25.789
I WANT TO THANK THE WITNESS

02:34:25.856 --> 02:34:26.323
TODAY. THIS IS INCREDIBLY

02:34:26.390 --> 02:34:28.792
IMPORTANT AND OBVIOUSLY IN

02:34:28.859 --> 02:34:29.627
STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL.

02:34:29.693 --> 02:34:31.662
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

02:34:31.729 --> 02:34:35.232
MEMBER BAUER-KAHAN. THANK YOU. I

02:34:35.299 --> 02:34:37.167
WANT TO START BY THANKING THE

02:34:37.234 --> 02:34:38.235
AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL,

02:34:38.302 --> 02:34:40.237
AND I WANT TO THANK ALL THE

02:34:40.304 --> 02:34:41.405
WITNESSES FOR BEING HERE. AND I

02:34:41.472 --> 02:34:43.307
I'M REALLY BAD AT NAMES, SO I

02:34:43.374 --> 02:34:44.274
DON'T REMEMBER ANYBODY'S NAMES.

02:34:44.341 --> 02:34:46.010
SO I APOLOGIZE ABOUT THAT. BUT I

02:34:46.076 --> 02:34:47.745
WANT TO THANK BOTH OF YOU FOR

02:34:47.811 --> 02:34:50.047
BEING HERE. I WANT TO LIVE IN A

02:34:50.114 --> 02:34:51.015
STATE WHERE EVERYBODY GETS TO

02:34:51.081 --> 02:34:52.216
LIVE THEIR TRUTH, NO MATTER WHAT

02:34:52.282 --> 02:34:54.084
THAT TRUTH LOOKS LIKE. AND

02:34:54.151 --> 02:34:54.652
PRIVACY IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT

02:34:54.718 --> 02:34:57.755
PIECE OF THAT. AND THAT'S WHAT

02:34:57.821 --> 02:34:59.023
THIS BILL IS FUNDAMENTALLY

02:34:59.089 --> 02:35:01.759
ABOUT. AND SO I THINK IT'S

02:35:01.825 --> 02:35:03.494
REALLY CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT

02:35:03.560 --> 02:35:06.697
WE DO THAT. I REALLY WANTED TO

02:35:06.764 --> 02:35:08.399
SPEAK IN PART BECAUSE ONE OF THE

02:35:08.465 --> 02:35:11.602
THINGS YOU SAID, YOU SAID ONLY

02:35:11.669 --> 02:35:12.736
TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE TRANS WERE

02:35:12.803 --> 02:35:14.338
KILLED BECAUSE OF THEIR TRANS

02:35:14.405 --> 02:35:16.707
STATUS, AND I WAS SHOOK BY THE

02:35:16.774 --> 02:35:21.111
WORD ONLY I'M JEWISH. AND I HAD

02:35:21.178 --> 02:35:22.413
SOMEONE RECENTLY SAY TO ME, ONLY

02:35:22.479 --> 02:35:23.814
ONE PERSON WAS BEAT BECAUSE

02:35:23.881 --> 02:35:24.982
THEY'RE JEWISH. THE WORD ONLY

02:35:25.049 --> 02:35:26.750
SHOULD NEVER GO BEFORE THAT

02:35:26.817 --> 02:35:29.987
SENTENCE. ONE PERSON IS TOO

02:35:30.054 --> 02:35:33.223
MANY. AND SO I JUST WANTED TO

02:35:33.290 --> 02:35:34.658
SAY THAT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK

02:35:34.725 --> 02:35:37.661
WE NEED TO COMPARE HATE CRIMES.

02:35:37.728 --> 02:35:39.296
THE HARMS YOU DESCRIBED AGAINST

02:35:39.363 --> 02:35:41.899
CHRISTIAN INDIVIDUALS ARE ALSO

02:35:41.965 --> 02:35:43.200
HORRIFIC, AND EVERY SINGLE ONE

02:35:43.267 --> 02:35:44.568
OF THOSE SHOULD BE PREVENTED,

02:35:44.635 --> 02:35:45.769
AND EVERY CRIME AGAINST TRANS

02:35:45.836 --> 02:35:47.171
PEOPLE SHOULD BE PREVENTED. AND

02:35:47.237 --> 02:35:49.707
NOBODY SHOULD EVER BE HURT OR

02:35:49.773 --> 02:35:50.808
KILLED BECAUSE OF THEIR

02:35:50.874 --> 02:35:53.110
IDENTITY. FULL STOP. AND SO I

02:35:53.177 --> 02:35:54.812
JUST DIDN'T WANT THAT TO GO

02:35:54.878 --> 02:35:58.449
WITHOUT BEING SAID, BECAUSE

02:35:58.515 --> 02:35:59.683
NEVER SHOULD WE ALLOW SOMEONE TO

02:35:59.750 --> 02:36:01.652
SAY ONLY TWO OF ANYBODY WAS

02:36:01.719 --> 02:36:03.120
KILLED BECAUSE THOSE WERE

02:36:03.187 --> 02:36:04.521
PRECIOUS LIVES. AND I KNOW I

02:36:04.588 --> 02:36:06.390
THINK YOU AGREE WITH ME THAT

02:36:06.457 --> 02:36:08.158
EVERY LIFE IS PRECIOUS AND THAT,

02:36:08.225 --> 02:36:10.294
YOU KNOW, MY FAITH TEACHES ME

02:36:10.360 --> 02:36:13.664
THAT. AND SO, YOU KNOW, I JUST

02:36:13.731 --> 02:36:15.365
WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THOSE

02:36:15.432 --> 02:36:16.266
LIVES LOST WERE TOO MANY AND

02:36:16.333 --> 02:36:19.036
THAT IF THIS BILL SAVES EVEN ONE

02:36:19.103 --> 02:36:21.071
LIFE, THAT TO ME, THAT IS

02:36:21.138 --> 02:36:21.572
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND

02:36:21.638 --> 02:36:23.607
VALUABLE AND I'M HAPPY TO

02:36:23.674 --> 02:36:26.176
SUPPORT IT TODAY. ASSEMBLYMEMBER

02:36:26.243 --> 02:36:28.412
STEPHANIE, THANK YOU, CHAIR, AND

02:36:28.479 --> 02:36:30.647
I WANT TO THANK, SENATOR, FOR

02:36:30.714 --> 02:36:31.882
BRINGING THIS BILL. I DON'T WANT

02:36:31.949 --> 02:36:34.318
TO GET EMOTIONAL, BUT I HAVE A

02:36:34.384 --> 02:36:36.653
TRANS BROTHER. AND THE FACT THAT

02:36:36.720 --> 02:36:39.123
YOU STAND UP FOR TRANS PEOPLE

02:36:39.189 --> 02:36:45.129
AND THE HATRED THAT IS OUT THERE

02:36:45.195 --> 02:36:48.198
IS JUST SO DEVASTATING TO ME. I

02:36:48.265 --> 02:36:50.667
THINK BASED ON WHAT YOU SAID,

02:36:50.734 --> 02:36:52.002
ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAUER-KAHAN,

02:36:52.069 --> 02:36:55.038
THAT WE SHOULD ALL REALLY

02:36:55.105 --> 02:36:56.473
EXAMINE OURSELVES AND TRY SO

02:36:56.540 --> 02:36:58.142
MUCH HARDER TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER

02:36:58.208 --> 02:37:01.445
FOR WHO WE ARE, WHATEVER THAT

02:37:01.512 --> 02:37:03.814
IS. AND WHAT I'M SEEING IN

02:37:03.881 --> 02:37:05.349
TODAY'S SOCIETY IS JUST

02:37:05.415 --> 02:37:06.483
DEVASTATING TO ME. AND I THINK

02:37:06.550 --> 02:37:07.751
I'M EMOTIONAL BECAUSE MY STEPMOM

02:37:07.818 --> 02:37:11.488
JUST PASSED AWAY AND THIS IS MY

02:37:11.555 --> 02:37:14.658
TRANS BROTHER. IT'S HIS MOM, AND

02:37:14.725 --> 02:37:17.828
I SEE THE DAMAGE THAT CAN BE

02:37:17.895 --> 02:37:20.931
DONE WHEN PEOPLE HATE PEOPLE FOR

02:37:20.998 --> 02:37:22.833
WHO THEY NEED TO BE AND WHO THEY

02:37:22.900 --> 02:37:26.270
ARE. AND I JUST AM SO TIRED OF

02:37:26.336 --> 02:37:30.374
IT. AND I JUST THANK YOU SO MUCH

02:37:30.440 --> 02:37:31.542
FOR EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO FOR

02:37:31.608 --> 02:37:32.476
PEOPLE. AND I'M SORRY THAT

02:37:32.543 --> 02:37:34.411
PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS

02:37:34.478 --> 02:37:35.712
ABOUT IT, BUT JUST TRY HARDER TO

02:37:35.779 --> 02:37:37.080
LOVE PEOPLE FOR JUST WHO THEY

02:37:37.147 --> 02:37:39.616
ARE. THAT MESSAGE NEEDS TO GET

02:37:39.683 --> 02:37:43.120
OUT. AND I'M JUST I'M DEVASTATED

02:37:43.187 --> 02:37:45.455
BY THE ACTS OF HATE THAT I SEE

02:37:45.522 --> 02:37:47.424
IN THIS THAT ARE DIRECTED

02:37:47.491 --> 02:37:48.959
TOWARDS THIS COMMUNITY. IT JUST

02:37:49.026 --> 02:37:50.661
DEVASTATES ME FOR MY BROTHER AND

02:37:50.727 --> 02:37:53.630
IT DEVASTATES ME FOR EVERYONE.

02:37:53.697 --> 02:37:54.765
SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

02:37:54.832 --> 02:37:58.335
BRINGING THIS FORWARD. SO THANK

02:37:58.402 --> 02:38:00.137
YOU, MR. CHAIR. THANK YOU TO THE

02:38:00.204 --> 02:38:02.272
AUTHOR. THANK YOU TO ALL THE

02:38:02.339 --> 02:38:03.040
TESTIFYING WITNESSES AND

02:38:03.106 --> 02:38:04.808
OBVIOUSLY MY COLLEAGUES FOR VERY

02:38:04.875 --> 02:38:05.976
POWERFUL STATEMENTS. I WANTED TO

02:38:06.043 --> 02:38:07.477
CIRCLE BACK ON ONE POINT THAT

02:38:07.544 --> 02:38:08.979
WAS RAISED AND JUST ALLOW THE

02:38:09.046 --> 02:38:10.781
AUTHOR TO ADDRESS IT. THE PUBLIC

02:38:10.848 --> 02:38:13.350
SAFETY ASPECTS OF

02:38:13.417 --> 02:38:14.952
CONFIDENTIALITY, I WOULD ASSUME.

02:38:15.018 --> 02:38:16.386
AND I THINK IT GOES WITHOUT

02:38:16.453 --> 02:38:18.856
SAYING, THAT THERE IS ALWAYS A

02:38:18.922 --> 02:38:21.458
BURDEN THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT

02:38:21.525 --> 02:38:23.160
THERE WERE A PUBLIC SAFETY

02:38:23.227 --> 02:38:25.295
CONCERN, SOME SORT OF

02:38:25.362 --> 02:38:26.530
INVESTIGATION, THE

02:38:26.597 --> 02:38:28.265
CONFIDENTIALITY COULD BE LIFTED

02:38:28.332 --> 02:38:29.766
IF NECESSARY. SO I WANTED TO

02:38:29.833 --> 02:38:31.568
GIVE YOU THAT OPPORTUNITY TO

02:38:31.635 --> 02:38:32.436
RESPOND JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:38:32.502 --> 02:38:34.671
EVERYONE WAS ON THE SAME PAGE.

02:38:34.738 --> 02:38:35.405
YEAH. YOU KNOW, UNFORTUNATELY,

02:38:35.472 --> 02:38:36.907
WE SEE A NARRATIVE ABOUT TRANS

02:38:36.974 --> 02:38:38.942
PEOPLE THAT IT'S ALL LIKE LIKE A

02:38:39.009 --> 02:38:40.744
SCAM, FRAUDULENT. AND IT'S

02:38:40.811 --> 02:38:43.614
REALLY, YOU KNOW, OFFENSIVE AND

02:38:43.680 --> 02:38:44.848
HARMFUL. BUT THANK YOU FOR

02:38:44.915 --> 02:38:46.116
RAISING THIS BECAUSE THE BILL

02:38:46.183 --> 02:38:47.985
DOES NOT PRECLUDE IF YOU HAVE

02:38:48.051 --> 02:38:50.220
WHETHER IT'S A LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:38:50.287 --> 02:38:52.689
INVESTIGATION OR EVEN LIKE A

02:38:52.756 --> 02:38:54.625
CREDITOR OR IT CAN BE WITH A

02:38:54.691 --> 02:38:57.327
MOTION, IT CAN BE LIFTED. AND SO

02:38:57.394 --> 02:38:59.029
THIS IS IT BECOMES CONFIDENTIAL.

02:38:59.096 --> 02:39:00.631
BUT IF THERE'S A IF THERE'S A

02:39:00.697 --> 02:39:03.033
LEGAL REASON THAT IT NEEDS TO BE

02:39:03.100 --> 02:39:06.103
LIFTED, THAT CAN HAPPEN VIA A

02:39:06.169 --> 02:39:09.439
MOTION. YEAH. THANK YOU, MADAM

02:39:09.506 --> 02:39:12.242
VICE CHAIR. YES, SENATOR. I JUST

02:39:12.309 --> 02:39:14.645
HAVE A QUICK QUESTION ON THE

02:39:14.711 --> 02:39:16.346
IMPLEMENTATION. SO THE JUDICIAL

02:39:16.413 --> 02:39:18.982
COUNCIL HAS STATED, I THINK IN

02:39:19.049 --> 02:39:21.385
THEIR LETTER THAT AND I THINK

02:39:21.451 --> 02:39:23.687
YOU'VE AMENDED IT TO GO BACK

02:39:23.754 --> 02:39:24.721
ONLY FIVE YEARS. IS THAT

02:39:24.788 --> 02:39:26.556
CORRECT? FIVE YEARS. AND THEN WE

02:39:26.623 --> 02:39:28.325
GAVE THEM MORE TIME PER THE

02:39:28.392 --> 02:39:29.059
COMMITTEE'S AMENDMENTS. YEAH.

02:39:29.126 --> 02:39:30.794
OKAY. SO I'M JUST LOOKING AT THE

02:39:30.861 --> 02:39:33.330
PRACTICAL ASPECTS OF OPENING UP

02:39:33.397 --> 02:39:35.632
EVERY NAME CHANGE DOCUMENT OR

02:39:35.699 --> 02:39:37.367
HOW DO WHAT WHAT ARE YOU

02:39:37.434 --> 02:39:38.802
TARGETING. BECAUSE HOW DO YOU

02:39:38.869 --> 02:39:41.471
IDENTIFY THAT PARTICULAR FILE.

02:39:41.538 --> 02:39:43.173
YEAH I MEAN WE THINK THEY CAN DO

02:39:43.240 --> 02:39:44.508
IT. WE UNDERSTAND I RESPECT THE

02:39:44.574 --> 02:39:46.009
JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND OBVIOUSLY

02:39:46.076 --> 02:39:48.879
IT IS, YOU KNOW, SOME WORK THAT

02:39:48.946 --> 02:39:51.081
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO. BUT

02:39:51.148 --> 02:39:52.683
WE DID MAKE AMENDMENTS TO LIMIT

02:39:52.749 --> 02:39:54.985
IT TO THE FIVE YEARS OF

02:39:55.052 --> 02:39:56.586
RETROACTIVITY INSTEAD OF, YOU

02:39:56.653 --> 02:39:58.989
KNOW, NO LIMITATION. AND THEN

02:39:59.056 --> 02:40:01.024
THE PER THE AMENDMENTS SAY

02:40:01.091 --> 02:40:02.559
GETTING UNTIL I THINK IT'S THE

02:40:02.626 --> 02:40:06.096
END OF 26 OR THE END OF 2026.

02:40:06.163 --> 02:40:08.398
AND SO WE TRIED, YOU KNOW, WE'VE

02:40:08.465 --> 02:40:11.168
BEEN FLEXIBLE IN THAT REGARD.

02:40:11.234 --> 02:40:12.769
AND WE'RE TRYING TO STRIKE A

02:40:12.836 --> 02:40:14.972
BALANCE. WE WANT TO BE MINDFUL

02:40:15.038 --> 02:40:15.605
OF THEIR OF THEIR WORKLOAD AND

02:40:15.672 --> 02:40:17.774
NOT PUT UNREASONABLE BURDENS ON

02:40:17.841 --> 02:40:19.776
THEM, BUT ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT

02:40:19.843 --> 02:40:22.079
THIS IS IMPACTING REAL PEOPLE,

02:40:22.145 --> 02:40:25.015
REAL LIVES. AND I ALSO WE YOU

02:40:25.082 --> 02:40:26.249
KNOW, I SAID THIS AT THE

02:40:26.316 --> 02:40:28.085
BEGINNING, WE HAVE TO ALSO BE

02:40:28.151 --> 02:40:29.586
CONSCIOUS OF THE TIME PERIOD

02:40:29.653 --> 02:40:33.824
THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW WITH,

02:40:33.890 --> 02:40:35.292
YOU KNOW, THE ATTACKS THAT ARE

02:40:35.359 --> 02:40:37.094
BEING LAUNCHED DAILY AGAINST

02:40:37.160 --> 02:40:38.195
TRANS PEOPLE. I MEAN, THE

02:40:38.261 --> 02:40:40.397
PRESIDENT JUST POSTED YESTERDAY,

02:40:40.464 --> 02:40:43.600
HIS POST WAS ABOUT ESCALATING

02:40:43.667 --> 02:40:45.035
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT AND

02:40:45.102 --> 02:40:46.670
SEVERAL CITIES ANNOUNCING THAT

02:40:46.737 --> 02:40:49.439
HE WAS DOING THAT AND THEN FELT

02:40:49.506 --> 02:40:52.142
THE NEED TO TAKE A POT SHOT AT

02:40:52.209 --> 02:40:53.243
TRANS PEOPLE AS PART OF THAT. I

02:40:53.310 --> 02:40:54.845
MEAN, IN A WAY THAT LITERALLY

02:40:54.911 --> 02:40:57.347
WAS COMPLETELY UNRELATED TO WHAT

02:40:57.414 --> 02:40:59.516
HE WAS POSTING ABOUT IN TERMS OF

02:40:59.583 --> 02:41:00.517
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT. SO HE

02:41:00.584 --> 02:41:03.120
IS LIKE THIS CULTURE WAR AGAINST

02:41:03.186 --> 02:41:05.222
TRANS PEOPLE TO DEHUMANIZE THEM

02:41:05.288 --> 02:41:06.423
BECAUSE IT'S LIKE RED MEAT FOR

02:41:06.490 --> 02:41:08.091
THE BASE OR WHATEVER. HIS

02:41:08.158 --> 02:41:11.294
RATIONALE IS THAT HAS REAL

02:41:11.361 --> 02:41:13.997
IMPACT ON PEOPLE'S LIVES, CAUSES

02:41:14.064 --> 02:41:15.999
PEOPLE TO LIVE IN FEAR, PUTS

02:41:16.066 --> 02:41:17.768
PEOPLE AT RISK. THE DOXING YOU

02:41:17.834 --> 02:41:20.337
JUST HEARD ABOUT THAT?

02:41:20.404 --> 02:41:23.273
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT'S A COMMON

02:41:23.340 --> 02:41:24.775
OCCURRENCE AND I SEE IT ONLINE.

02:41:24.841 --> 02:41:26.943
I'M NOT TRANS, BUT I SEE IT

02:41:27.010 --> 02:41:29.913
ONLINE AND IT IS IT'S REALLY

02:41:29.980 --> 02:41:31.481
SCARY. SO WE'RE TRYING TO STRIKE

02:41:31.548 --> 02:41:33.283
THAT BALANCE. AND I THINK WE DID

02:41:33.350 --> 02:41:34.418
THAT WITH THIS BILL OKAY. ALL

02:41:34.484 --> 02:41:37.587
RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELL

02:41:37.654 --> 02:41:39.523
I WANT TO THANK YOU, SENATOR,

02:41:39.589 --> 02:41:41.691
AND FOR THE COMMENTS FROM OUR

02:41:41.758 --> 02:41:43.060
COLLEAGUES, YOU KNOW, VALIDATING

02:41:43.126 --> 02:41:44.294
EVERYONE THAT'S COME HERE TO

02:41:44.361 --> 02:41:46.696
SPEAK TODAY. AND I THINK THAT,

02:41:46.763 --> 02:41:48.665
YOU KNOW, THE SUGGESTION THAT

02:41:48.732 --> 02:41:52.402
SOMEONE WOULD FEIGN A TRANS

02:41:52.469 --> 02:41:55.605
IDENTITY FOR IN ORDER TO COMMIT

02:41:55.672 --> 02:41:57.474
SOME CRIME OR FRAUD OR WHATEVER

02:41:57.541 --> 02:42:00.210
IT MIGHT BE, I THINK THAT IS

02:42:00.277 --> 02:42:05.982
LUDICROUS. THE AMOUNT OF HATRED

02:42:06.049 --> 02:42:09.286
AND AS MENTIONED BY OUR AUTHOR,

02:42:09.352 --> 02:42:11.354
EVEN COMING FROM THE HIGHEST

02:42:11.421 --> 02:42:13.190
PLACES, IT MAKES IT REALLY

02:42:13.256 --> 02:42:14.391
CHALLENGING AND DIFFICULT, A

02:42:14.458 --> 02:42:15.792
DIFFICULT MOMENT FOR OUR TRANS

02:42:15.859 --> 02:42:17.260
COMMUNITY. BUT I KNOW THAT THOSE

02:42:17.327 --> 02:42:19.463
THAT ENDURE DO IT BECAUSE THEY

02:42:19.529 --> 02:42:20.497
DO WANT TO LIVE THEIR TRUE

02:42:20.564 --> 02:42:22.399
SELVES. THEY WANT TO LIVE THEIR

02:42:22.466 --> 02:42:24.301
TRUE. THEY WANT TO BE THEIR TRUE

02:42:24.367 --> 02:42:25.669
SELVES. AND ANY OPPORTUNITY WE

02:42:25.735 --> 02:42:27.704
HAVE TO CREATE SOME SOME SENSE

02:42:27.771 --> 02:42:29.506
OF COMFORT IN THAT, SOME SENSE

02:42:29.573 --> 02:42:31.341
OF SECURITY IN THAT WE SHOULD

02:42:31.408 --> 02:42:33.076
DO. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE

02:42:33.143 --> 02:42:34.811
HAVE HERE TODAY. AND SO I'M VERY

02:42:34.878 --> 02:42:36.580
GRATEFUL, SENATOR WIENER, FOR

02:42:36.646 --> 02:42:38.782

02:42:41.151 --> 02:42:42.419
PIECE OF LEGISLATION FORWARD

02:42:42.486 --> 02:42:43.954
THAT ALLOWS TO GIVE, ALLOWS SOME

02:42:44.020 --> 02:42:46.356
SENSE OF COMFORT OR SECURITY OR

02:42:46.423 --> 02:42:48.091
SPACE THAT SHOULD BE THE

02:42:48.158 --> 02:42:49.826
OBLIGATION OF THE STATE TO DO.

02:42:49.893 --> 02:42:52.929
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE? I THINK

02:42:52.996 --> 02:42:53.563

02:42:53.630 --> 02:42:54.197

CONTAINS VARIOUS INFORMATION

02:44:52.148 --> 02:44:53.850
ABOUT DIFFERENT KINDS OF

02:44:53.917 --> 02:44:55.685
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, TYPICALLY

02:44:55.752 --> 02:44:57.420
CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES LIKE

02:44:57.487 --> 02:44:59.456
OPIOIDS. AND IT'S DESIGNED TO BE

02:44:59.522 --> 02:45:01.424
ABLE TO MONITOR IF THERE'S

02:45:01.491 --> 02:45:03.960
OVERPRESCRIPTION HAPPENING, ETC.

02:45:04.027 --> 02:45:10.300
AS IN OCTOBER 2024, WE. LEARNED

02:45:10.367 --> 02:45:13.236
THAT TESTOSTERONE PRESCRIPTION

02:45:13.303 --> 02:45:16.006
DATA WAS ACCESSIBLE TO LAW

02:45:16.072 --> 02:45:17.107
ENFORCEMENT THROUGHOUT THE

02:45:17.173 --> 02:45:19.276
COUNTRY WITHOUT ANY SAFEGUARDS,

02:45:19.342 --> 02:45:21.745
NO WARRANT, NO SUBPOENA IN

02:45:21.811 --> 02:45:25.815
NEARLY HALF OF STATES. AND

02:45:25.882 --> 02:45:26.783
CALIFORNIA IS AMONG THOSE STATES

02:45:26.850 --> 02:45:30.353
THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE A WARRANT.

02:45:30.420 --> 02:45:32.255
WE KNOW THAT TESTOSTERONE IS

02:45:32.322 --> 02:45:34.224
FREQUENTLY PRESCRIBED FOR

02:45:34.291 --> 02:45:35.558
CONDITIONS UNRELATED TO GENDER

02:45:35.625 --> 02:45:38.061
AFFIRMING CARE. HOWEVER, IT IS

02:45:38.128 --> 02:45:40.997
PRESCRIBED FOR TRANS PEOPLE. NOT

02:45:41.064 --> 02:45:46.136
ALL, BUT SOME WHO TRANSITION. WE

02:45:46.202 --> 02:45:47.404
TALKED ABOUT THE CHALLENGES

02:45:47.470 --> 02:45:49.239
TRANS PEOPLE FACE. WE NEED TO

02:45:49.306 --> 02:45:51.708
MAKE THIS INFORMATION

02:45:51.775 --> 02:45:52.842
CONFIDENTIAL SO THAT IT CANNOT

02:45:52.909 --> 02:45:57.947
BE ABUSED. AND THEN WE ARE

02:45:58.014 --> 02:45:59.582
EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF SB 107,

02:45:59.649 --> 02:46:02.585
WHICH WE PASSED IN 2022 TO

02:46:02.652 --> 02:46:05.455
ADDRESS RED STATE ATTACKS ON

02:46:05.522 --> 02:46:06.823
TRANS PEOPLE, CRIMINALIZING

02:46:06.890 --> 02:46:08.692
TRANS PEOPLE, AND MAKING CLEAR

02:46:08.758 --> 02:46:10.560
THAT IN CALIFORNIA, WE'RE NOT

02:46:10.627 --> 02:46:12.162
GOING TO BE ADOPTING AND

02:46:12.228 --> 02:46:14.698
ENFORCING THESE HATEFUL LAWS

02:46:14.764 --> 02:46:16.232
FROM OTHER STATES, AND THAT

02:46:16.299 --> 02:46:18.134
PEOPLE CAN COME HERE AND EXIST

02:46:18.201 --> 02:46:19.769
HERE AND RECEIVE HEALTH CARE

02:46:19.836 --> 02:46:23.273
HERE. AND UNLESS WE ARE REQUIRED

02:46:23.340 --> 02:46:24.574
BY THE UNITED STATES

02:46:24.641 --> 02:46:25.875
CONSTITUTION, WE'RE NOT GOING TO

02:46:25.942 --> 02:46:28.912
BE A PARTY TO THEIR

02:46:28.978 --> 02:46:30.013
CRIMINALIZATION. SO I

02:46:30.080 --> 02:46:31.948
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE

02:46:32.015 --> 02:46:34.918
WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IS MARI

02:46:34.984 --> 02:46:37.020

SUPPORT SERVICES IN SUPPORT OF

02:46:46.796 --> 02:46:49.265
SB 497. AS WE'VE MENTIONED TODAY,

02:46:49.332 --> 02:46:51.101
ACROSS THE COUNTRY, WE'VE SEEN A

02:46:51.167 --> 02:46:52.969
DRASTIC RISE IN ANTI-TRANS

02:46:53.036 --> 02:46:54.003
LEGISLATION THAT TARGETS TRANS

02:46:54.070 --> 02:46:55.872
EXISTENCE FROM EVERY ANGLE

02:46:55.939 --> 02:46:57.273
ACCESS TO GENDER AFFIRMING CARE,

02:46:57.340 --> 02:46:58.675
THE ABILITY TO PLAY IN SPORTS,

02:46:58.742 --> 02:46:59.809
ACCURATE IDENTIFICATION

02:46:59.876 --> 02:47:01.644
DOCUMENTS, AND SO MUCH MORE.

02:47:01.711 --> 02:47:03.446
THESE BILLS CLAIM TO BE ABOUT

02:47:03.513 --> 02:47:04.514
PROTECTION AND SAFETY, BUT AS

02:47:04.581 --> 02:47:06.216
TRANS PEOPLE, WE SEE THE REALITY

02:47:06.282 --> 02:47:08.051
THAT THEY'RE ABOUT PUSHING US

02:47:08.118 --> 02:47:09.152
OUT OF SPACES THAT WE HAVE EVERY

02:47:09.219 --> 02:47:10.220
RIGHT TO EXIST IN.

02:47:10.286 --> 02:47:11.221
UNFORTUNATELY, WE'RE NOW SEEING

02:47:11.287 --> 02:47:12.455
THIS APPLY DIRECTLY TO THE

02:47:12.522 --> 02:47:14.057
PLACES WHERE TRANS PEOPLE CAN

02:47:14.124 --> 02:47:14.891
LIVE, BUILD COMMUNITY, AND RAISE

02:47:14.958 --> 02:47:16.226
FAMILIES. A FEDERAL EXECUTIVE

02:47:16.292 --> 02:47:18.128
ORDER AIMS TO BAN GENDER

02:47:18.194 --> 02:47:18.762
AFFIRMING CARE NATIONWIDE, AND

02:47:18.828 --> 02:47:19.729
OVER 20 STATES HAVE ALREADY

02:47:19.796 --> 02:47:21.364
ENACTED RESTRICTIONS ON TRANS

02:47:21.431 --> 02:47:22.298
HEALTHCARE. THE RESULT HAS BEEN

02:47:22.365 --> 02:47:25.034
A MASS MIGRATION OF OVER 130,000

02:47:25.101 --> 02:47:26.169
TRANS PEOPLE FLEEING THEIR HOME

02:47:26.236 --> 02:47:27.837
STATES IN SEARCH OF SAFETY AND

02:47:27.904 --> 02:47:29.472
AFFIRMING HEALTH CARE.

02:47:29.539 --> 02:47:30.340
CALIFORNIA HAS LONG BEEN A

02:47:30.407 --> 02:47:32.075
BEACON OF HOPE FOR THOSE SEEKING

02:47:32.142 --> 02:47:33.576
REFUGE. WE'VE LED THE WAY IN

02:47:33.643 --> 02:47:34.744
PROVIDING PROTECTIONS FOR THE

02:47:34.811 --> 02:47:35.745
MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IN

02:47:35.812 --> 02:47:37.147
SB 497 ALLOWS US TO REINFORCE

02:47:37.213 --> 02:47:38.815
OUR ROLE AS A TRUE SANCTUARY

02:47:38.882 --> 02:47:40.216
STATE, NOT JUST AN IDEOLOGY, BUT

02:47:40.283 --> 02:47:42.685
A POLICY TO. WHEN WE SAY THAT

02:47:42.752 --> 02:47:43.887
GENDER AFFIRMING CARE IS LIFE

02:47:43.953 --> 02:47:45.221
SAVING CARE, WE'RE NOT BEING

02:47:45.288 --> 02:47:46.556
HYPERBOLIC. ACCESS TO PUBERTY

02:47:46.623 --> 02:47:47.657
BLOCKERS, HORMONES, AND

02:47:47.724 --> 02:47:48.825
AFFIRMING SURGERIES NOT ONLY

02:47:48.892 --> 02:47:50.126
LOWERS THE RISK OF SELF-HARM AND

02:47:50.193 --> 02:47:51.661
SUICIDAL IDEATION, BUT IT ALSO

02:47:51.728 --> 02:47:52.962
CREATES THE SPACES THAT TRANS

02:47:53.029 --> 02:47:54.564
PEOPLE NEED TO THRIVE. AS

02:47:54.631 --> 02:47:55.398
SOMEONE WHO'S EXPERIENCED

02:47:55.465 --> 02:47:56.633
SUICIDAL IDEATION MYSELF, THE

02:47:56.699 --> 02:47:58.201
FIRST TIME I GOT TO AFFIRM MY

02:47:58.268 --> 02:48:00.303
GENDER THROUGH MY CLOTHES, NAME,

02:48:00.370 --> 02:48:01.571
AND PRONOUNS, I FELT LIKE I HAD

02:48:01.638 --> 02:48:03.940
A REASON TO LIVE. THE FIRST TIME

02:48:04.007 --> 02:48:05.308
I WAS ABLE TO TAKE CONTROL OF MY

02:48:05.375 --> 02:48:06.576
OWN MEDICAL DECISIONS, I FELT

02:48:06.643 --> 02:48:08.511
LIKE I HAD ACCESS TO A FUTURE.

02:48:08.578 --> 02:48:10.280
THIS BILL IS VITAL BECAUSE IT

02:48:10.346 --> 02:48:10.880
PREVENTS THE WEAPONIZATION OF

02:48:10.947 --> 02:48:12.148
OUR PERSONAL HEALTH INFORMATION

02:48:12.215 --> 02:48:13.183
WITHOUT SAFEGUARDS. THIS DATA

02:48:13.249 --> 02:48:14.517
CAN BE USED AS A TOOL TO HARASS,

02:48:14.584 --> 02:48:16.352
FORCIBLY OUT, AND OTHERWISE HARM

02:48:16.419 --> 02:48:17.487
TRANS PEOPLE, THEIR FAMILIES,

02:48:17.554 --> 02:48:18.455
AND THEIR MEDICAL PROVIDERS. SB

02:48:18.521 --> 02:48:19.789
497 ESTABLISHES THE NECESSARY

02:48:19.856 --> 02:48:20.623
PROTECTIONS TO ENSURE THAT

02:48:20.690 --> 02:48:22.225
CALIFORNIA IS NOT COMPLICIT IN

02:48:22.292 --> 02:48:23.827
THIS HARM. IT SENDS THE MESSAGE

02:48:23.893 --> 02:48:25.128
THAT TRANS PEOPLE ARE SAFE HERE,

02:48:25.195 --> 02:48:26.830
OUR CARE IS PROTECTED AND OUR

02:48:26.896 --> 02:48:28.264
IDENTITIES WILL NOT BE USED

02:48:28.331 --> 02:48:30.133
AGAINST US. TRANS PEOPLE ARE NOT

02:48:30.200 --> 02:48:31.701
ABSTRACT NUMBERS OR TALKING

02:48:31.768 --> 02:48:32.535
POINTS. WE ARE PEOPLE WITH

02:48:32.602 --> 02:48:34.404
LIVES, FAMILIES AND FUTURES. IF

02:48:34.471 --> 02:48:36.039
YOUR GOAL IS TRULY ABOUT

02:48:36.105 --> 02:48:37.273
PROTECTION AND SAFETY, THEN IT

02:48:37.340 --> 02:48:38.875
HAS TO START WITH PROTECTING US.

02:48:38.942 --> 02:48:40.944
SO FOR THAT REASON, I URGE YOUR

02:48:41.010 --> 02:48:42.545
SUPPORT OF SB 497. THANK YOU.

02:48:42.612 --> 02:48:44.080
GOOD MORNING, CHAIR AND MEMBERS,

02:48:53.523 --> 02:48:55.658
TRANS YOUTH AND THEIR FAMILIES,

02:48:55.725 --> 02:48:56.659
PROTECTING THEM FROM STATES THAT

02:48:56.726 --> 02:48:57.794
WERE CRIMINALIZING GENDER

02:48:57.861 --> 02:48:59.596
AFFIRMING CARE. AS WE'VE BEEN

02:48:59.662 --> 02:49:01.097
DISCUSSING, THESE ATTACKS HAVE

02:49:01.164 --> 02:49:02.232
ESCALATED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE

02:49:02.298 --> 02:49:04.434

ESPECIALLY WITHIN THE LAST SIX

02:49:05.969 --> 02:49:08.271

02:49:08.338 --> 02:49:10.139
MEASURE TO ENSURE THAT

02:49:10.206 --> 02:49:11.975

ACCESS OR DISCLOSURE OF THAT

02:49:29.592 --> 02:49:31.227

02:49:31.294 --> 02:49:33.463
ALSO INCLUDES A NUMBER OF

02:49:33.530 --> 02:49:34.197
PROVISIONS TO PROHIBIT

THE OPPOSITE. SB 497 BUILDS ON

02:52:27.837 --> 02:52:30.139

TO BE FULLY CHALLENGED IN COURT.

02:52:35.645 --> 02:52:37.714
SB 107 ENTICES CHILDREN WHOSE

MEDICALLY TRANSITION TO RUN AWAY

02:52:41.284 --> 02:52:43.086
TO CALIFORNIA. IT ALSO PERMITS A

02:52:43.152 --> 02:52:44.487
NON-CUSTODIAL PARENT TO ABSCOND

02:52:44.554 --> 02:52:45.855

AUTHORITY. THE BILL ANALYSIS

02:52:58.968 --> 02:53:00.403
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE

CONSTITUTIONALITY OF SB 497

02:53:02.939 --> 02:53:04.373
HINGES ON APPLYING THE PUBLIC

02:53:04.440 --> 02:53:05.541
POLICY EXCEPTION TO THE FULL

02:53:05.608 --> 02:53:07.110
FAITH AND CREDIT CLAUSE, WHICH

02:53:07.176 --> 02:53:08.277
REQUIRES STATES TO HONOR EACH

OTHER'S PUBLIC ACTS AND JUDICIAL

02:53:10.546 --> 02:53:12.248
PROCEEDINGS. THE PUBLIC POLICY

02:53:12.315 --> 02:53:13.816
EXCEPTION IS NARROW, HOWEVER,

02:53:13.883 --> 02:53:15.618
AND ONLY ALLOWS ONE STATE TO

02:53:15.685 --> 02:53:17.320
DISREGARD ANOTHER'S LAWS WHEN

02:53:17.386 --> 02:53:18.821
ENFORCING THEM WOULD VIOLATE A

02:53:18.888 --> 02:53:20.123
CLEAR, DOMINANT PUBLIC POLICY

02:53:20.189 --> 02:53:22.024
GROUNDED IN CORE VALUES. THE

02:53:22.091 --> 02:53:23.326
PUBLIC POLICY EXCEPTION DOESN'T

02:53:23.392 --> 02:53:25.228
APPLY WHEN THE STATE INVOKING IT

02:53:25.294 --> 02:53:26.629
DEMONSTRATES A POLICY OF

02:53:26.696 --> 02:53:27.430
HOSTILITY TOWARDS OTHER STATES,

02:53:27.497 --> 02:53:30.199
AS CALIFORNIA HAS HERE. ATTORNEY

02:53:30.266 --> 02:53:32.068
GENERAL ROB BONTA HAS AUTHORED

02:53:32.135 --> 02:53:33.402

REMOVING THEIR HEALTHY BODY

02:53:42.445 --> 02:53:44.247
PARTS. THIS DEMONSTRATES THAT

02:53:44.313 --> 02:53:45.548
CALIFORNIA IS HOSTILE TOWARDS

02:53:45.615 --> 02:53:47.016
STATES THAT WANT TO PROTECT

02:53:47.083 --> 02:53:48.684
CHILDREN'S ABILITY TO GROW UP

02:53:48.751 --> 02:53:51.087
NATURALLY. TRANSGENDERISM IS A

02:53:51.154 --> 02:53:52.588
HOMOPHOBIC IDEOLOGY AND

02:53:52.655 --> 02:53:54.390

02:53:54.457 --> 02:53:55.391
KIDS STRAIGHT BY MEDICALLY

02:53:55.458 --> 02:53:57.426

02:53:57.493 --> 02:53:59.295
THAT AS YOU CONTINUE TO PUSH

02:53:59.362 --> 02:54:00.897
TRANSGENDERISM AND STERILIZE

02:54:00.963 --> 02:54:05.902

DELIBERATELY MISLED INTO

CATEGORICALLY FALSE, A

02:54:25.788 --> 02:54:27.089

02:57:57.433 --> 02:57:59.368

02:58:21.223 --> 02:58:24.593
RESPECT TO HEALTH CARE IS REAL.

02:58:24.660 --> 02:58:27.596
HEARING JUST IN THE LAST FEW

02:58:27.663 --> 02:58:30.900
WEEKS, TRANS KIDS LOSING THEIR

02:58:30.966 --> 02:58:32.968
HEALTH CARE BECAUSE INSTITUTIONS

02:58:33.035 --> 02:58:35.571
ARE JUST SEIZING SERVICES,

02:58:35.638 --> 02:58:37.206
BECAUSE WE HAVE FOLKS FROM THE

02:58:37.273 --> 02:58:38.741
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND RISKS OF

02:58:38.808 --> 02:58:41.310
THOSE COMING FROM OUT OF STATE

02:58:41.377 --> 02:58:43.612
REALLY TRYING TO ELIMINATE

02:58:43.679 --> 02:58:45.147
HEALTH CARE, GENDER AFFIRMING

02:58:45.214 --> 02:58:49.151
CARE FOR TRANSGENDER AND LGBTQ

02:58:49.218 --> 02:58:50.686
PEOPLE. IT IS REAL. IT'S

02:58:50.753 --> 02:58:53.422
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. AND WHY IT

02:58:53.489 --> 02:58:55.257
IS EVEN APPROPRIATE FOR SOMEONE

02:58:55.324 --> 02:58:56.759
FROM OUT OF STATE TO BE

02:58:56.826 --> 02:58:58.494
ACCESSING SOMEONE'S MEDICAL

02:58:58.561 --> 02:58:59.862
RECORDS, WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE

02:58:59.929 --> 02:59:02.998
TRANS IS THE FIRST QUESTION. BUT

02:59:03.065 --> 02:59:04.967
WE ALSO KNOW THAT THIS COMMUNITY

02:59:05.034 --> 02:59:07.870
IS AT VERY, VERY HIGH RISK. AND

02:59:07.937 --> 02:59:09.371
SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT

02:59:09.438 --> 02:59:12.441
ONLY IMPORTANT, IT'S URGENT. WE

02:59:12.508 --> 02:59:15.511
ARE SEEING THE FOCUSED ATTEMPT

02:59:15.578 --> 02:59:17.546
BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO

02:59:17.613 --> 02:59:20.483
SHUT DOWN HEALTH CARE FOR TRANS

02:59:20.549 --> 02:59:22.284
PEOPLE AND PEOPLE IN THE LGBTQ

02:59:22.351 --> 02:59:24.153
COMMUNITY. AND SO I JUST WANT TO

AS A MORAL PANIC IN THIS SPACE.

02:59:54.350 --> 02:59:56.452
AND IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR A

02:59:56.519 --> 02:59:59.355
WHILE. THE PRESIDENT, DURING HIS

02:59:59.421 --> 03:00:00.256
CAMPAIGN, I THINK, DURING ONE OF

03:00:00.322 --> 03:00:01.924
THE DEBATES, ESCALATED WHEN HE

03:00:01.991 --> 03:00:03.692
TALKED ABOUT, SAID THAT THERE

03:00:03.759 --> 03:00:06.262
WAS A CHILD THAT WENT TO SCHOOL,

03:00:06.328 --> 03:00:07.830
ONE GENDER HAD, I GUESS, SURGERY

03:00:07.897 --> 03:00:09.098
AT SCHOOL AND THEN CAME HOME A

03:00:09.165 --> 03:00:11.300
DIFFERENT GENDER. I MEAN, JUST

03:00:11.367 --> 03:00:13.335
LIKE, YOU KNOW, CREATING, LIKE

03:00:13.402 --> 03:00:16.305
JUST LYING TO TRY TO SCARE

03:00:16.372 --> 03:00:19.942
PEOPLE. AND SINCE TAKING OFFICE,

03:00:20.009 --> 03:00:21.110
EVEN THOUGH, YOU KNOW, HE'S

03:00:21.177 --> 03:00:24.213
TALKED ABOUT YOUTH, THEY'RE

03:00:24.280 --> 03:00:26.515
TRYING TO ELIMINATE HEALTH CARE

03:00:26.582 --> 03:00:28.017
FOR ALL TRANS PEOPLE, FOR ADULTS

03:00:28.083 --> 03:00:31.387
AS WELL. THEY'RE REALLY NOT EVEN

03:00:31.453 --> 03:00:32.021
DISTINGUISHING. THEY'RE TRYING

03:00:32.087 --> 03:00:34.056
TO JUST TAKE A WRECKING BALL TO

03:00:34.123 --> 03:00:36.859
THAT HEALTH CARE ACCESS. WE ALSO

03:00:36.926 --> 03:00:38.961
NEED TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THE

03:00:39.028 --> 03:00:41.697
ACTUAL FACTS. THE VAST MAJORITY

03:00:41.764 --> 03:00:44.300
OF TRANS IDENTIFYING KIDS DO NOT

03:00:44.366 --> 03:00:46.835
EVEN RECEIVE A DIAGNOSIS, LET

03:00:46.902 --> 03:00:48.404
ALONE ACTUAL CARE. THEY'RE JUST

03:00:48.470 --> 03:00:50.139
LIVING THEIR BEST LIVES AND

03:00:50.206 --> 03:00:52.041
BEING WHO THEY ARE, AND THE

03:00:52.107 --> 03:00:53.008
SMALL MINORITY WHO ACTUALLY

03:00:53.075 --> 03:00:57.413
RECEIVE CARE. THEY ARE. OR

03:00:57.479 --> 03:00:59.315
EXCUSE ME, OF THOSE WHO RECEIVE

03:00:59.381 --> 03:01:00.749
A DIAGNOSIS, A LARGE MAJORITY

03:01:00.816 --> 03:01:02.518
STILL DON'T RECEIVE ANY PHYSICAL

03:01:02.585 --> 03:01:04.386
CARE. AND THEN OF THE SMALL

03:01:04.453 --> 03:01:06.088
NUMBER WHO ARE RECEIVING

03:01:06.155 --> 03:01:08.824
PHYSICAL CARE, MICROSCOPIC

03:01:08.891 --> 03:01:10.759
PERCENTAGE ARE RECEIVING SURGERY

03:01:10.826 --> 03:01:13.629
UNDER THE AGE OF 18. AND I SAY

03:01:13.696 --> 03:01:16.498
THIS. AND FOR THE FOR THE KIDS

03:01:16.565 --> 03:01:17.299
WHO ARE RECEIVING THAT CARE, IT

03:01:17.366 --> 03:01:18.968
IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND THEY

03:01:19.034 --> 03:01:20.102
SHOULD HAVE FULL ACCESS TO IT.

03:01:20.169 --> 03:01:21.804
BUT THERE IS THIS NOTION THAT

03:01:21.870 --> 03:01:23.572
THAT IT'S JUST EVERYONE IS

03:01:23.639 --> 03:01:26.508
GETTING SURGERY. AND THAT IS NOT

03:01:26.575 --> 03:01:29.078
TRUE. IT IS A HUGE SPECTRUM. AND

03:01:29.144 --> 03:01:30.779
FOR THE KIDS WHO ARE RECEIVING

03:01:30.846 --> 03:01:34.116
CARE, THEY'RE DOING IT

03:01:34.183 --> 03:01:35.284
OVERWHELMINGLY WITH THE CONSENT

03:01:35.351 --> 03:01:36.952
AND PARTICIPATION OF THEIR

03:01:37.019 --> 03:01:38.220
PARENTS, BECAUSE IN CALIFORNIA,

03:01:38.287 --> 03:01:40.155
UNDER THE AGE OF 18, WITH VERY

03:01:40.222 --> 03:01:42.224
FEW EXCEPTIONS, GETTING MEDICAL

03:01:42.291 --> 03:01:43.726
CARE REQUIRES THE CONSENT OF THE

03:01:43.792 --> 03:01:45.194
PARENTS UNLESS YOU'RE

03:01:45.261 --> 03:01:47.363
EMANCIPATED. AND SO THIS THIS

03:01:47.429 --> 03:01:49.098
MORAL PANIC THAT HAS TURNED INTO

03:01:49.164 --> 03:01:51.367
AN ENTIRE POLITICAL MOVEMENT TO

03:01:51.433 --> 03:01:53.102
TRY TO DEHUMANIZE TRANS PEOPLE

03:01:53.168 --> 03:01:54.637
AND ELIMINATE THEIR ACCESS TO

03:01:54.703 --> 03:01:57.239
HEALTH CARE, IT IS

03:01:57.306 --> 03:01:58.774
REPREHENSIBLE. AND THIS BILL IS

03:01:58.841 --> 03:02:00.109
ONE STEP IN TRYING TO PROTECT
