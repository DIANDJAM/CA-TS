CALIFORNIA FILM AND TELEVISION

02:18:21.626 --> 02:18:24.129
TAX CREDIT. IT'S A FALSE CHOICE

02:18:24.195 --> 02:18:25.797
FOR ANYONE TO SAY THAT

02:18:25.864 --> 02:18:27.265
CALIFORNIA HAS TO CHOOSE BETWEEN

02:18:27.332 --> 02:18:28.500
RETAINING AND GROWING JOBS IN

02:18:28.566 --> 02:18:30.368

FILM INDUSTRY CAN AND MUST DO

02:18:35.907 --> 02:18:37.676
BOTH. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS BILL

02:18:37.742 --> 02:18:39.310
DOES NOT CONTAIN LANGUAGE FROM

02:18:39.377 --> 02:18:41.079
EITHER. MY COLLEAGUE FROM

DEVELOPED AND SUBMIT TO THE

02:18:56.661 --> 02:18:58.763
CALIFORNIA FILM COMMISSION. IT'S

02:18:58.830 --> 02:19:00.565
SIMPLE MATH. IF THE STUDIOS

02:19:00.632 --> 02:19:02.867
CHOOSE TO APPLY FOR ADDITIONAL

02:19:02.934 --> 02:19:04.636

02:19:04.703 --> 02:19:06.337
TO DO THE WORK THEY ARE

02:19:06.404 --> 02:19:07.839
COMMITTED TO DO. CURRENTLY,

02:19:07.906 --> 02:19:09.240
STUDIOS ONLY HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE

02:19:09.307 --> 02:19:11.142
A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO

02:19:13.645 --> 02:19:15.714
ADDITIONAL TAX CREDITS. AND

02:19:15.780 --> 02:19:17.916
FRANKLY, THAT'S JUST NOT GOOD

02:19:17.982 --> 02:19:20.452
ENOUGH. MEMBERS, WE HAVE TO DO

02:19:20.518 --> 02:19:22.520
BETTER. WE DO NOT HAVE TO CHOOSE

02:19:22.587 --> 02:19:23.388
BETWEEN RETAINING AND GROWING

02:19:23.455 --> 02:19:25.423
JOBS IN THE FILM AND TELEVISION

02:19:25.490 --> 02:19:27.559
INDUSTRY, AND INCREASING THE

02:19:27.625 --> 02:19:29.227

02:22:30.508 --> 02:22:32.744
CANNABIS MARKET, BAD ACTORS WHO

02:22:32.810 --> 02:22:34.646
ARE TARGETING KIDS AND POLLUTING

02:22:34.712 --> 02:22:36.347
THE ENVIRONMENT. THE DEPARTMENT

02:22:36.414 --> 02:22:38.116

SUBCOMMITTEE. WE HAVE DISCUSSED

02:22:41.886 --> 02:22:43.454
THE ISSUE ENFORCEMENT OF THE

02:22:46.324 --> 02:22:47.425
WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT THIS

02:22:47.492 --> 02:22:49.627
APPROACH. APPROACH. THE LEGAL

02:22:49.694 --> 02:22:51.663
CANNABIS MARKET IS MORE THAN

02:22:51.729 --> 02:22:52.397
EIGHT TIMES THE SIZE OF THE

02:22:52.463 --> 02:22:54.599
LEGAL MARKET. IT IS NOT

02:22:54.666 --> 02:22:56.301
REASONABLE TO REQUIRE LEGAL

02:22:56.367 --> 02:22:58.937
CANNABIS BUSINESS BUSINESSES TO

02:22:59.003 --> 02:23:00.672
SHOULDER A CRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT

02:23:00.738 --> 02:23:02.941
BURDEN OF THIS SIZE. WE NEED

02:23:03.007 --> 02:23:04.809
GREATER ENFORCEMENT OF ILLICIT

02:23:04.876 --> 02:23:06.811

02:23:06.878 --> 02:23:08.212
WILL PROVIDE THE NECESSARY TOOLS

02:23:08.279 --> 02:23:10.515
AND RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THE

02:23:10.581 --> 02:23:12.383
ISSUE. OPPONENTS ARGUE THAT WE

02:23:12.450 --> 02:23:13.952
SHOULD SIMPLY INCREASE

02:23:14.018 --> 02:23:15.787
REGULATORY FEES ON LEGAL

02:23:15.853 --> 02:23:17.388
CANNABIS INDUSTRY, BUT THIS

02:23:17.455 --> 02:23:19.424
WOULD ONLY SHRINK THE INDUSTRY

02:23:19.490 --> 02:23:21.492
FURTHER AND AS A RESULT, REDUCE

02:23:21.559 --> 02:23:24.362
CANNABIS TAX REVENUE. WITHOUT A

HEALTHY, SUSTAINABLE LICENSED

02:23:26.297 --> 02:23:27.498
CANNABIS MARKET, THERE WILL BE

02:23:27.565 --> 02:23:29.901
NO REVENUE TO FUND THE SECONDARY

02:23:29.968 --> 02:23:31.970

02:23:32.036 --> 02:23:34.205

WHO IS EXPECTING HIS FIRST CHILD

02:29:56.287 --> 02:29:58.723

CONSULTANT ON OUR ASSEMBLY

02:30:01.492 --> 02:30:02.226
HEALTH COMMITTEE. SHE WAS

02:30:02.293 --> 02:30:03.861
ACTUALLY DUE TO GIVE BIRTH FIVE

02:30:03.928 --> 02:30:05.830
DAYS AGO. AND SO WE'VE BEEN

02:30:05.896 --> 02:30:07.231
HAVING A DEBATE IN OUR OFFICE

02:30:07.298 --> 02:30:08.766
ABOUT WHICH WOULD COME FIRST,

02:30:08.833 --> 02:30:10.534
BUDGET OR BABY. AND SO RIGHT NOW

02:30:10.601 --> 02:30:12.169
IT LOOKS LIKE BUDGET IS GOING TO

02:30:12.236 --> 02:30:15.906
WIN, BUT WE WANT TO EXPECT THEM.

02:30:15.973 --> 02:30:18.142

EXCUSE ME, AB 102, WHICH AMENDS

02:30:35.693 --> 02:30:37.795
SB 101 AND REFLECTS OUR FINAL

02:30:37.862 --> 02:30:39.163
THREE PARTY AGREEMENT WITH THE

02:30:39.230 --> 02:30:40.698
GOVERNOR. COLLEAGUES, I'M PROUD

02:30:40.765 --> 02:30:42.566
TO REPORT THAT THIS BILL IN IN

02:30:42.633 --> 02:30:43.934
LARGE SENSE, MIRRORS OUR

02:30:44.001 --> 02:30:44.668
LEGISLATIVE BUDGET IN SOME

02:30:44.735 --> 02:30:45.903
REALLY IMPORTANT WAYS. THE

02:30:45.970 --> 02:30:47.071
BUDGET, THE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET

02:30:47.138 --> 02:30:49.573
PLAN THAT WE PASSED A FEW WEEKS

02:30:49.640 --> 02:30:51.442
AGO. MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT IS

02:30:51.509 --> 02:30:53.344
GROUNDED IN OUR TWIN GOALS OF

02:30:53.411 --> 02:30:55.179
COMPASSION AND FISCAL

02:30:55.246 --> 02:30:56.480
RESPONSIBILITY, WHICH WE HAVE

02:30:56.547 --> 02:30:57.848
STUCK, TO WHICH WE HAVE

02:30:57.915 --> 02:30:59.016
ENDEAVORED TO BALANCE THIS YEAR.

02:30:59.083 --> 02:31:00.418
IT REFLECTS THE ARCHITECTURE

02:31:00.484 --> 02:31:02.186
THAT THE LEGISLATURE PUT FORWARD

02:31:02.253 --> 02:31:04.889
OF MAKING TOUGH CHOICES AND

02:31:04.955 --> 02:31:06.190
STRETCHING OUR DOLLARS, BUT ALSO

02:31:06.257 --> 02:31:07.758
DOING THAT IN A WAY THAT

02:31:07.825 --> 02:31:09.193
PROTECTED OUR KEY SAFETY NET

02:31:09.260 --> 02:31:10.261
PROGRAMS AND PRESERVE

02:31:10.327 --> 02:31:11.662
FLEXIBILITY FOR THE CHALLENGES

02:31:11.729 --> 02:31:14.031
AHEAD. AND I'M PROUD THAT THIS

02:31:14.098 --> 02:31:14.865
BILL INCORPORATES KEY

02:31:14.932 --> 02:31:16.700
INVESTMENTS CHAMPIONED BY THE BY

02:31:16.767 --> 02:31:18.536
THE ASSEMBLY, MOST NOTABLY

02:31:18.602 --> 02:31:19.870
HOUSING, HEALTH CARE, CHILD

02:31:19.937 --> 02:31:21.705
CARE, EDUCATION, WILDFIRE

02:31:21.772 --> 02:31:23.574
RESILIENCE AND PUBLIC SAFETY.

02:31:23.641 --> 02:31:25.376
AND AS WE TALKED ABOUT TWO WEEKS

02:31:25.443 --> 02:31:27.545
AGO AND WE TALKED ABOUT IN OUR

02:31:27.611 --> 02:31:28.446
BUDGET COMMITTEE, THIS WAS A

02:31:28.512 --> 02:31:29.280
PAINFUL PROCESS, OFTEN WITH

02:31:29.346 --> 02:31:30.548
DIFFICULT AND AGONIZING CHOICES,

02:31:30.614 --> 02:31:31.916
AS WE SOUGHT TO BALANCE

02:31:31.982 --> 02:31:33.184
COMPASSION AND FISCAL

02:31:33.250 --> 02:31:34.952
RESPONSIBILITY. BUT I AM REALLY

02:31:35.019 --> 02:31:36.387
CONFIDENT THAT OUR, OUR CHAIRS

02:31:36.454 --> 02:31:38.055
AND OUR COMMITTEE MET THAT

02:31:38.122 --> 02:31:39.056
CHALLENGE HEAD ON, AND I'M

02:31:39.123 --> 02:31:40.458
REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THEIR HARD

02:31:40.524 --> 02:31:42.092
WORK. I'M PROUD OF HOW FAR WE

02:31:42.159 --> 02:31:44.028
MOVED THIS BUDGET FROM THE MAY

02:31:44.094 --> 02:31:45.830
REVISE TO THE FINAL, TO THE

02:31:45.896 --> 02:31:47.598
FINAL PRODUCT THAT WE HAVE

02:31:47.665 --> 02:31:48.766
BEFORE US TODAY. IT'S THE

02:31:48.833 --> 02:31:50.267
PRODUCT OF TOUGH AND COMPLICATED

02:31:50.334 --> 02:31:51.602
AND DIFFICULT NEGOTIATIONS, BUT

02:31:51.669 --> 02:31:53.904
I WANT TO THANK OUR PARTNERS IN

02:31:53.971 --> 02:31:54.505
THOSE NEGOTIATIONS, BECAUSE I

02:31:54.572 --> 02:31:55.706
BELIEVE TODAY THAT WE HAVE A

02:31:55.773 --> 02:31:56.841
BUDGET THAT MORE CLOSELY

02:31:56.907 --> 02:31:58.843
REFLECTS OUR VALUES. WE KNOW, WE

02:31:58.909 --> 02:31:59.844
KNOW COLLEAGUES, THAT WE ARE

02:31:59.910 --> 02:32:01.145
FACING UNPRECEDENTED THREATS

02:32:01.212 --> 02:32:02.780
FROM WASHINGTON, D.C. SO THIS IS

02:32:02.847 --> 02:32:05.349
A JOURNEY THAT IS NOT OVER. WE

02:32:05.416 --> 02:32:06.984
KNOW THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK

02:32:07.051 --> 02:32:08.252
AHEAD OF US. UNFORTUNATELY, THEY

02:32:08.319 --> 02:32:08.853
ARE CONTEMPLATING CHOICES IN

02:32:08.919 --> 02:32:10.287
WASHINGTON THAT COULD THAT COULD

02:32:10.354 --> 02:32:11.522
FORCE US TO COME BACK AND

02:32:11.589 --> 02:32:13.224
CONTINUE TO DO WORK ON THIS

02:32:13.290 --> 02:32:15.493
BUDGET, BUT WE WILL BE PREPARED

02:32:15.559 --> 02:32:17.194
TO MEET THOSE TWO. I FEEL THAT

02:32:17.261 --> 02:32:18.095
VERY CONFIDENTLY, BECAUSE OF THE

02:32:18.162 --> 02:32:19.196
ABLE WORK OF OUR BUDGET

02:32:19.263 --> 02:32:20.431
SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIRS AND OUR

02:32:20.498 --> 02:32:21.432
BUDGET COMMITTEE, WE ARE GOING

02:32:21.499 --> 02:32:22.466
TO MEET WHATEVER THE MOMENT

02:32:22.533 --> 02:32:24.235
REQUIRES OF US. SO WITH THAT,

02:32:24.301 --> 02:32:25.803
AND WITH GRATITUDE FOR THE WORK

02:32:25.870 --> 02:32:27.004
THAT WAS DONE TO BALANCE

02:32:27.071 --> 02:32:28.372
COMPASSION AND FISCAL

02:32:28.439 --> 02:32:29.106
RESPONSIBILITY, RESPECTFULLY

02:32:29.173 --> 02:32:31.509
REQUEST AND I VOTE ON AB 102.

02:32:31.575 --> 02:32:33.043
THANK YOU, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:32:33.110 --> 02:32:34.345
GABRIEL. MR. FLOOR LEADER, YOU

02:32:34.411 --> 02:32:35.946
ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MR.

02:32:36.013 --> 02:32:38.015
SPEAKER. I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO

02:32:38.082 --> 02:32:39.450
AB 102, CONTINUES UNSUSTAINABLE

02:32:39.517 --> 02:32:40.985
SPENDING LEVELS AND PROVIDES

02:32:41.051 --> 02:32:42.419
INSUFFICIENT FUNDING FOR PROP

02:32:42.486 --> 02:32:44.522
36, PROVIDES NO FUNDING FOR

02:32:44.588 --> 02:32:46.090
WILDFIRE PREVENTION OR SURFACE

02:32:46.156 --> 02:32:47.424
WATER STORAGE. PROVIDES NO

02:32:47.491 --> 02:32:48.893
FUNDING OR POLICY CHANGES TO

02:32:48.959 --> 02:32:51.128
PREVENT HIGH GAS PRICES. AND I

02:32:51.195 --> 02:32:52.129
THINK ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING

02:32:52.196 --> 02:32:54.465
THAT'S MISSING IN 102 IS OVER

02:32:54.532 --> 02:32:55.833
THE LAST FEW YEARS, OUR AIR

02:32:55.900 --> 02:32:57.501
AMBULANCE SERVICES HAVE NOT HAD

02:32:57.568 --> 02:32:59.336
AN INCREASE IN THEIR

02:32:59.403 --> 02:32:59.870
REIMBURSEMENT. CURRENTLY,

02:32:59.937 --> 02:33:00.838
THEY'RE GETTING REIMBURSED ABOUT

02:33:00.905 --> 02:33:02.840
20% OF WHAT THEY NEED. IF THIS

02:33:02.907 --> 02:33:04.375
CONTINUES, I KNOW THERE'S A TIME

02:33:04.441 --> 02:33:05.776
FRAME OUT IN THE FUTURE, ABOUT

02:33:05.843 --> 02:33:07.311
FOUR AND A HALF YEARS FROM NOW

02:33:07.378 --> 02:33:09.680
THAT THAT WILL GO UP, BUT I'M

02:33:09.747 --> 02:33:10.381
NOT SURE THEY CAN STAY IN

02:33:10.447 --> 02:33:12.416
BUSINESS UNTIL THEN. SO I THINK

02:33:12.483 --> 02:33:13.551
THAT IS SOMETHING WE TRULY NEED

02:33:13.617 --> 02:33:15.085
TO ADDRESS AND GET THOSE

02:33:15.152 --> 02:33:16.453
REIMBURSEMENT RATES A BIT HIGHER

THERE WERE NO DOLLARS ALLOCATED

FIGURE IT OUT WHEN WE REALIZE

02:34:52.516 --> 02:34:54.251
THAT THERE WAS NO SUPPORT FOR

02:34:54.318 --> 02:34:55.285
THIS VERY IMPORTANT SEGMENT OF

02:34:55.352 --> 02:34:57.788

I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU.

ASSEMBLY MEMBER RANSOM, ASSEMBLY

02:35:03.661 --> 02:35:04.828
MEMBER DAVIS, YOU ARE

02:35:04.895 --> 02:35:07.131
RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MR.

02:35:07.197 --> 02:35:10.634
SPEAKER. I RISE IN OPPOSITION. I

02:35:10.701 --> 02:35:13.537
HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT I'M SO

02:35:13.604 --> 02:35:14.304
DISAPPOINTED WHEN IT COMES TO

02:35:14.371 --> 02:35:15.639
THIS, ESPECIALLY WHEN WE TALK

02:35:15.706 --> 02:35:18.175
ABOUT PROP 36. THE VOTERS, AT

02:35:18.242 --> 02:35:21.845
LEAST 70% VOTED TO HAVE PROP 36.

02:35:21.912 --> 02:35:24.515
BUT WHAT GOOD IS IT IF YOU'RE

02:35:24.581 --> 02:35:25.582
NOT GOING TO FUND IT? AND NOT

02:35:25.649 --> 02:35:26.517
ONLY ARE YOU NOT REALLY FUNDING

02:35:26.583 --> 02:35:28.786
IT, WE EVEN REDUCED WHAT THE

02:35:28.852 --> 02:35:30.521
FUNDING WAS TO BEGIN WITH. YOU

02:35:30.587 --> 02:35:32.322
HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND, IF WE

02:35:32.389 --> 02:35:33.557
DON'T HAVE THE MONEY FOR

02:35:33.624 --> 02:35:34.825
PROBATION OFFICERS OR

02:35:34.892 --> 02:35:35.726
TREATMENTS, YOU HAVE PEOPLE

02:35:35.793 --> 02:35:38.295
LINED UP RIGHT NOW NEEDING HELP

02:35:38.362 --> 02:35:39.963
AND WAITING A YEAR. WAITING TWO

02:35:40.030 --> 02:35:41.999
YEARS DOESN'T DO IT. YOU HAVE SO

02:35:42.066 --> 02:35:44.535
MANY SUICIDES THAT COME UP SO

02:35:44.601 --> 02:35:46.670
QUICKLY. I HAD AN AMENDMENT TO

02:35:46.737 --> 02:35:49.206
FULLY FUND THIS WITH $400

02:35:49.273 --> 02:35:50.641
MILLION, BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT

02:35:50.708 --> 02:35:52.543
WASN'T HEARD AND DIDN'T GO

02:35:52.609 --> 02:35:54.178
FORWARD. BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:35:54.244 --> 02:35:57.147
WATER. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FIRE

02:35:57.214 --> 02:35:58.515
PREVENTION. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:35:58.582 --> 02:36:02.086
MENTAL ILLNESS. THOSE ARE NOT

02:36:02.152 --> 02:36:05.055
EXTRA LUXURY ITEMS. THOSE ARE

02:36:05.122 --> 02:36:06.790
NECESSITIES. AND YET WE STILL

02:36:06.857 --> 02:36:08.625
PUSH THIS FORWARD. SO HOW ARE WE

02:36:08.692 --> 02:36:10.427
SUPPOSED TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE

02:36:10.494 --> 02:36:11.228
THAT NEED TREATMENT? WE'RE NOT

02:36:11.295 --> 02:36:13.297
GOING TO FUND IT. YOU KNOW,

02:36:13.363 --> 02:36:15.499
WE'RE DEFINITELY LETTING DOWN

02:36:15.566 --> 02:36:17.334
CALIFORNIANS. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO

02:36:17.401 --> 02:36:19.203
REPRESENT THEIR VOICE. BUT THIS

02:36:19.269 --> 02:36:20.871
DOES NOT DO THAT. YOU BASICALLY

02:36:20.938 --> 02:36:22.372
JUST SAID, WELL, YEAH, WE KNOW

02:36:22.439 --> 02:36:24.408
YOU LIKED IT AND YOU KNOW YOU

02:36:24.475 --> 02:36:26.043
WANTED THIS, BUT WE'RE NOT GOING

02:36:26.110 --> 02:36:27.277
TO FUND IT. AND THAT IS OUR

02:36:27.344 --> 02:36:29.213
RESPONSIBILITY WHEN THEY VOTE ON

02:36:29.279 --> 02:36:31.648
SOMETHING. SO I ASK FOR

02:36:31.715 --> 02:36:33.517
OPPOSITION VOTE. THANK YOU.

02:36:33.584 --> 02:36:35.619
THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:36:35.686 --> 02:36:36.320
DAVIS, ASSEMBLY MEMBER DIXON,

02:36:36.386 --> 02:36:39.923
YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU,

02:36:39.990 --> 02:36:42.893
MR. SPEAKER. I RISE TODAY ALSO

02:36:42.960 --> 02:36:45.496
TO OPPOSE SENATE BILL 102. THIS

02:36:45.562 --> 02:36:48.165
MEASURE HAS INDEED HAS A LOT OF

02:36:48.232 --> 02:36:50.033
A LOT OF PROVISIONS PACKED INTO

02:36:50.100 --> 02:36:51.835
IT. BUT I HAVE SEVERAL CONCERNS.

02:36:51.902 --> 02:36:53.270
PRIMARILY, IT DOES NOT PROVIDE

02:36:53.337 --> 02:36:54.705
ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR THE

02:36:54.772 --> 02:36:56.507
IMPLEMENTATION OF PROP 36, WHICH

02:36:56.573 --> 02:36:59.042
WAS, WE ALL KNOW, SUPPORTED BY

02:36:59.109 --> 02:37:02.613
HISTORIC 70% OF CALIFORNIANS, IS

02:37:02.679 --> 02:37:05.048
REALLY IN EFFECT, IS A BUDGET

02:37:05.115 --> 02:37:07.251
VETO FRANKLY INSULTING TO THOSE

02:37:07.317 --> 02:37:08.852
70% OF CALIFORNIA VOTERS? WE

02:37:08.919 --> 02:37:12.022
COULD HAVE FOUND SOME FUNDS TO

02:37:12.089 --> 02:37:13.824
GET THIS PROPOSITION IMPLEMENTED

02:37:13.891 --> 02:37:15.793
TO SAVE OUR COMMUNITIES. ALSO,

02:37:15.859 --> 02:37:17.427
IT LACKS NO NEW FUNDING FOR

02:37:17.494 --> 02:37:18.929
PROBATION DEPARTMENTS TO

02:37:18.996 --> 02:37:19.863
SUPERVISE AND CONNECT

02:37:19.930 --> 02:37:21.465
INDIVIDUALS TO TREATMENT. THIS

02:37:21.532 --> 02:37:23.901
IS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE SUPPORT

02:37:23.967 --> 02:37:25.002
FOR COMMUNITY LEVEL

02:37:25.068 --> 02:37:26.069
INTERVENTIONS, HOUSE ARRESTS,

02:37:26.136 --> 02:37:28.539
AND COUNTY JAIL AND IN CUSTODY

02:37:28.605 --> 02:37:30.340
TREATMENT. THIS IS ABOUT

02:37:30.407 --> 02:37:31.675
REHABILITATION. IT ALSO IS

02:37:31.742 --> 02:37:33.510
NEEDED TO PARTNER WITH SERVICE

02:37:33.577 --> 02:37:35.412
PROVIDERS. COURTS WILL

02:37:35.479 --> 02:37:37.514
ADDITIONALLY RECEIVE $10 MILLION

02:37:37.581 --> 02:37:39.750
LESS THAN THE LEGISLATURE

02:37:39.817 --> 02:37:40.784
APPROVED. WHEN THERE'S

02:37:40.851 --> 02:37:42.553
INCREASING WORKLOAD ON OUR CIVIL

02:37:42.619 --> 02:37:44.421
AND CRIMINAL COURT SYSTEM, WE

02:37:44.488 --> 02:37:46.323
KNOW THAT THEY'RE IN DIRE NEED

02:37:46.390 --> 02:37:47.958
OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO KEEP

02:37:48.025 --> 02:37:49.827
OUR COURT SYSTEM SMOOTHLY

02:37:49.893 --> 02:37:51.695
RUNNING. IT IS IMPERATIVE WE

02:37:51.762 --> 02:37:53.030
ADDRESS THE WILL OF THE VOTERS

02:37:53.096 --> 02:37:55.098
AND FULLY FUND RESOURCES FOR LAW

02:37:55.165 --> 02:37:57.401
ENFORCEMENT TO ENSURE PEOPLE ARE

02:37:57.467 --> 02:37:58.735
GETTING THE TREATMENT THEY NEED

02:37:58.802 --> 02:38:01.038
AND THE VOTERS ARE BEING

02:38:01.104 --> 02:38:02.739
LISTENED TO. I RESPECTFULLY

02:38:02.806 --> 02:38:04.908

FROM MEMBERS THAT ARE ASKING FOR

SPECIFIC FUNDING, MEETING AND

MAKING SURE VOICES ARE HEARD. AT

02:39:12.643 --> 02:39:14.478
THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR AND

02:39:14.544 --> 02:39:18.749
THE JANUARY BUDGET IN RELATED TO

HOUSING, THERE WAS $0 PUT FORTH,

02:39:22.419 --> 02:39:24.888
AND WE KNOW THAT HOUSING AND

02:39:24.955 --> 02:39:26.657
HOMELESSNESS REMAIN THE TOP

02:39:26.723 --> 02:39:29.559
CONCERNS FOR CALIFORNIANS. FOR

02:39:29.626 --> 02:39:30.928
CALIFORNIANS, WE KNOW

02:39:30.994 --> 02:39:33.130
AFFORDABILITY IS A MAJOR CONCERN

02:39:33.196 --> 02:39:35.632
RELATED TO HOUSING, AND THIS

02:39:35.699 --> 02:39:38.835
BUDGET RESTORES SOME OF THIS

02:39:38.902 --> 02:39:42.105
FUNDING. WE WERE ABLE TO INCLUDE

02:39:42.172 --> 02:39:43.273
500 MILLION FOR THE LOW INCOME

02:39:43.340 --> 02:39:48.111

THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

THIS FUNDING, AND WE ARE

02:40:06.630 --> 02:40:08.498
EXTREMELY PROUD TO RETAIN SOME

02:40:08.565 --> 02:40:10.200
OF THIS FUNDING. WE KNOW THERE

02:40:10.267 --> 02:40:12.803
WERE DIFFICULT CUTS. WE KNOW

02:40:12.869 --> 02:40:18.075
THAT THERE ARE MANY THAT WILL

02:40:18.141 --> 02:40:20.377
NOT HAVE AS MANY RESOURCES AS WE

02:40:20.444 --> 02:40:22.879
HAVE ADVOCATED FOR, BUT IN A

02:40:22.946 --> 02:40:24.648
SLIM BUDGET. I'M PROUD THAT WE

02:40:24.715 --> 02:40:26.750
WERE ABLE TO ADD THOSE DOLLARS.

02:40:26.817 --> 02:40:29.987
THIS BUDGET AGAIN, DIFFICULT FOR

02:40:30.053 --> 02:40:31.788
ALL OF US. IT RETAINS THE

02:40:31.855 --> 02:40:34.224
LEGISLATORS VALUE VALUES OF

02:40:34.291 --> 02:40:36.093
PROTECTING THE MOST VULNERABLE,

02:40:36.159 --> 02:40:37.995
HONORING OUR COMMITMENTS TO

02:40:38.061 --> 02:40:40.464
WORKERS AND VETERANS, SUPPORTING

02:40:40.530 --> 02:40:42.632
HOUSING AND INFRASTRUCTURE, AND

02:40:42.699 --> 02:40:45.035
PROMOTING FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY

02:40:45.102 --> 02:40:47.704
WHILE REJECTING FALSE CHOICES.

02:40:47.771 --> 02:40:49.373
WITH THAT, I ASK FOR YOUR

02:40:49.439 --> 02:40:51.508
SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

02:40:51.575 --> 02:40:53.310

02:40:54.611 --> 02:40:58.415
RECOGNIZED. COLLEAGUES, I TOO

02:40:58.482 --> 02:41:01.585
RISE IN STRONG OPPOSITION NOT

02:41:01.651 --> 02:41:04.087
BECAUSE OF WHAT'S NOT FUNDED.

02:41:04.154 --> 02:41:06.723
WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT PROP 36,

02:41:06.790 --> 02:41:09.126
BUT BECAUSE WHAT IS FUNDED AND

02:41:09.192 --> 02:41:11.628
SOME OF THE CBOS THAT I ACTUALLY

02:41:11.695 --> 02:41:14.197
DECIDED TO DO A DEEP DIVE INTO,

02:41:14.264 --> 02:41:16.700
ONE THAT I GOT THAT I FOUND OUT

02:41:16.767 --> 02:41:19.236
IN THIS RESEARCH, $7.5 MILLION

02:41:19.302 --> 02:41:20.871
FOR AN ORGANIZATION CALLED

02:41:20.937 --> 02:41:22.672
SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURS FOR

02:41:22.739 --> 02:41:24.875
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. WHAT DO

02:41:24.941 --> 02:41:27.310
YOU HAVE TO DO AND WHAT IS ONE

02:41:27.377 --> 02:41:28.845
OF THE REQUIREMENTS TO QUALIFY

02:41:28.912 --> 02:41:32.649
FOR THIS $7.5 MILLION? IT SAYS

02:41:32.716 --> 02:41:35.252
ON THEIR WEBSITE, INDIVIDUALS

02:41:35.318 --> 02:41:38.722
WHO ARE NEITHER US CITIZENS NOR

02:41:38.789 --> 02:41:42.392
LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENTS,

02:41:42.459 --> 02:41:45.195
MONEY FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE

02:41:45.262 --> 02:41:49.166
ILLEGAL. WHAT A SLAP IN THE FACE

02:41:49.232 --> 02:41:51.334
TO THE 20% OF RATEPAYERS WHO

02:41:51.401 --> 02:41:54.905
CAN'T AFFORD THEIR RATES. THE

02:41:54.971 --> 02:41:56.306
CALIFORNIANS WHO CAN'T AFFORD

02:41:56.373 --> 02:41:58.508
GROCERIES AND SERVICES. HERE,

02:41:58.575 --> 02:42:01.411
WE'RE ALLOCATING MORE MONEY FOR

02:42:01.478 --> 02:42:04.047
THE FOR OTHER FAMILIES. INSTEAD

02:42:04.114 --> 02:42:06.783
OF PRIORITIZING CALIFORNIANS.

02:42:06.850 --> 02:42:09.686
ANOTHER ORGANIZATION THAT I WAS

02:42:09.753 --> 02:42:12.122
ABLE TO LOOK INTO IS $2 MILLION

02:42:12.189 --> 02:42:13.290
FOR INITIATING CHANGE IN OUR

02:42:13.356 --> 02:42:14.691
NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITY

02:42:14.758 --> 02:42:16.526
DEVELOPMENT. THIS MORNING, I

02:42:16.593 --> 02:42:19.062
SPENT TIME ON THAT WEBSITE, AND

02:42:19.129 --> 02:42:21.498
WHAT WAS IT? I FILLED OUT THE

02:42:21.565 --> 02:42:23.100
DOCUMENT AND I GOT TO FIND OUT

02:42:23.166 --> 02:42:25.902
THAT IT'S CASH ASSISTANCE FOR

02:42:25.969 --> 02:42:29.539
THOSE FAMILIES THAT ALSO WERE

02:42:29.606 --> 02:42:31.308
INVOLVED WITH ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT

02:42:31.374 --> 02:42:34.778
ACTIVITIES. WHAT ABOUT THE

02:42:34.845 --> 02:42:36.346
CALIFORNIA FAMILIES THAT ARE

02:42:36.413 --> 02:42:40.283
BEGGING US, BEGGING US TO DO

02:42:40.350 --> 02:42:42.052
SOMETHING TO FIX THEIR COST OF

02:42:42.119 --> 02:42:45.755
LIVING? I THINK ABOUT, AGAIN, MY

02:42:45.822 --> 02:42:47.891
FAMILY, MY MOTHER, WHICH ALL OF

02:42:47.958 --> 02:42:52.529
YOU HAVE MET MAKES $24,000 A

02:42:52.596 --> 02:42:55.031
YEAR AFTER LOSING MY FATHER LAST

02:42:55.098 --> 02:42:57.601
YEAR. THE ONLY WAY WE MAKE ENDS

02:42:57.667 --> 02:43:01.004
MEET IS I SEND OUR TEAM TO GO

02:43:01.071 --> 02:43:03.406
AND PAY FOR GROCERIES. I JUST

02:43:03.473 --> 02:43:07.310
PAID THE TAXES ON OUR PROPERTY.

02:43:07.377 --> 02:43:10.614
WHAT ABOUT THOSE FAMILIES? WHAT

02:43:10.680 --> 02:43:13.049
ABOUT THE CALIFORNIANS THAT ARE

02:43:13.116 --> 02:43:15.218
DEMANDING THAT WE NEED MORE

02:43:15.285 --> 02:43:17.454
SERVICES BEFORE EXPANDING IT TO

02:43:17.521 --> 02:43:21.057
SO MANY OTHERS THAT WE ARE

02:43:21.124 --> 02:43:22.459
PRIORITIZING FUNDING? AND NOT

02:43:22.526 --> 02:43:26.396
ONLY THAT, CREATING BARRIERS FOR

02:43:26.463 --> 02:43:28.965
LEGAL CALIFORNIANS, FOR

02:43:29.032 --> 02:43:31.501
GENERATIONAL CALIFORNIANS THAT

02:43:31.568 --> 02:43:34.671
DON'T QUALIFY FOR THIS FUNDING.

02:43:34.738 --> 02:43:38.708
WHAT INSANITY. THIS BUDGET IS A

02:43:38.775 --> 02:43:41.044
REFLECTION OF OUR PRIORITIES,

02:43:41.111 --> 02:43:41.912
AND UNFORTUNATELY, IT DOESN'T

02:43:41.978 --> 02:43:43.346
PRIORITIZE CALIFORNIANS. AND I

02:43:43.413 --> 02:43:45.448
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO

02:43:45.515 --> 02:43:46.516
VOTE. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

02:43:46.583 --> 02:43:48.218
MEMBER, ASSEMBLY MEMBER DE MAYO,

02:43:48.285 --> 02:43:50.187
YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU,

02:43:50.253 --> 02:43:52.656
MR. SPEAKER. I ASK FOR A NO VOTE

02:43:52.722 --> 02:43:54.457
ON ASSEMBLY BILL 102. THERE'S

02:43:54.524 --> 02:43:56.359
BEEN A LOT OF CONGRATULATIONS

02:43:56.426 --> 02:43:59.896
TODAY, AND I GUESS I'LL GIVE YOU

02:43:59.963 --> 02:44:02.766
A RECOGNITION FOR EFFORT. BUT

02:44:02.832 --> 02:44:05.468
THE RESULT IS NOT A REAL BUDGET.

02:44:05.535 --> 02:44:08.471
YOU KNOW IT. AND SOON OUR

02:44:08.538 --> 02:44:10.373
CONSTITUENTS WILL KNOW IT. THIS

02:44:10.440 --> 02:44:12.108
IS A PHONY BUDGET. IT'S A BUDGET

02:44:12.175 --> 02:44:13.944
WITH ACCOUNTING GIMMICKS. IT'S A

02:44:14.010 --> 02:44:16.379
BUDGET BASED ON RATING RESERVES.

02:44:16.446 --> 02:44:18.848
IT'S NOT BALANCED WHEN YOU TAKE

02:44:18.915 --> 02:44:20.417
YOUR RESERVES, WHEN YOU PRETEND

02:44:20.483 --> 02:44:21.785
LIKE BILLS ARE ACTUALLY NOT

02:44:21.851 --> 02:44:24.020
GOING TO COME IN THIS YEAR,

02:44:24.087 --> 02:44:25.689
THAT'S A PHONY BUDGET. IT'S

02:44:25.755 --> 02:44:29.125
SOMETHING THAT ENRON WOULD DO.

02:44:29.192 --> 02:44:30.627
WE HAVE ENRON STYLE ACCOUNTING

02:44:30.694 --> 02:44:32.395
IN THIS BUDGET. WE KNOW THAT

02:44:32.462 --> 02:44:34.431
WE'RE GOING TO BE COMING BACK IN

02:44:34.497 --> 02:44:36.633
A MATTER OF WEEKS OR MONTHS

02:44:36.700 --> 02:44:38.301
SAYING, OOPS, IT LOOKS LIKE WE

02:44:38.368 --> 02:44:39.869
HAVE A DEFICIT. WELL, THE

02:44:39.936 --> 02:44:42.439
DEFICIT IS HIDDEN IN PLAIN

02:44:42.505 --> 02:44:43.807
SIGHT. WITH THESE ACCOUNTING

02:44:43.873 --> 02:44:46.309
GIMMICKS. WE OUGHT TO STAY AND

02:44:46.376 --> 02:44:48.445
MAKE THE TOUGH DECISIONS TO DO

02:44:48.511 --> 02:44:50.947
RIGHT BY CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS.

02:44:51.014 --> 02:44:53.250
NOW, WE COULD EASILY BALANCE THE

02:44:53.316 --> 02:44:56.786
BUDGET TODAY IF WE ELIMINATED

02:44:56.853 --> 02:44:59.456
THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS 12.5

02:44:59.522 --> 02:45:00.724
BILLION IN HEALTH CARE BENEFITS

02:45:00.790 --> 02:45:03.560
ALONE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:45:03.627 --> 02:45:04.494
NONCITIZENS, PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT

02:45:04.561 --> 02:45:07.230
HERE LEGALLY. NOW, WHILE YOU'RE

02:45:07.297 --> 02:45:09.666
FUNDING $12.5 BILLION IN ILLEGAL

02:45:09.733 --> 02:45:11.034
IMMIGRANT HEALTH CARE UNDER

02:45:11.101 --> 02:45:12.902
MEDI-CAL, PUTTING THE SYSTEM IN

02:45:12.969 --> 02:45:15.872
JEOPARDY, YOU ARE CUTTING HEALTH

02:45:15.939 --> 02:45:18.375
SERVICES FOR THE NEEDIEST

02:45:18.441 --> 02:45:20.877
CALIFORNIANS. YOU ALSO ARE

02:45:20.944 --> 02:45:22.112
UNDERFUNDING HEALTH CARE

02:45:22.178 --> 02:45:24.514
BENEFITS FOR STATE GOVERNMENT

02:45:24.581 --> 02:45:27.050
EMPLOYEES. I KNOW THAT MANY IN

02:45:27.117 --> 02:45:29.519
THIS CHAMBER HAVE EXPRESSED

02:45:29.586 --> 02:45:32.188
THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE LABOR

02:45:32.255 --> 02:45:33.723
UNIONS, FOR STATE GOVERNMENT

02:45:33.790 --> 02:45:36.326
EMPLOYEES, THIS BUDGET DOESN'T

02:45:36.393 --> 02:45:37.761
SUPPORT THEM BECAUSE IT

02:45:37.827 --> 02:45:40.463
LITERALLY DOESN'T FUND THEIR

02:45:40.530 --> 02:45:44.234
HEALTH BENEFITS UNDER OPEB. WE

02:45:44.301 --> 02:45:46.036
ALSO ARE SEEING HUNDREDS OF

02:45:46.102 --> 02:45:48.571
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR FAR LEFT

02:45:48.638 --> 02:45:50.674
WING POLITICAL GROUPS. AGAIN, I

02:45:50.740 --> 02:45:52.542
HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THEM

02:45:52.609 --> 02:45:54.010
RAISING PRIVATE MONEY. IT'S A

02:45:54.077 --> 02:45:56.112
FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT THAT EACH

02:45:56.179 --> 02:45:58.148
GROUP HAS. BUT AS MY COLLEAGUE

02:45:58.214 --> 02:46:01.151
FROM FRESNO POINTS OUT, WITH

02:46:01.217 --> 02:46:02.786
$8.5 MILLION GOING JUST TO TWO

02:46:02.852 --> 02:46:05.121
GROUPS, THE NUMBER IS ACTUALLY

02:46:05.188 --> 02:46:08.024
NORTHWARD OF $400 MILLION GOING

02:46:08.091 --> 02:46:10.026
TO LEFT WING GROUPS. AND WE'RE

02:46:10.093 --> 02:46:11.528
STILL COUNTING ALL THAT SHOULD

02:46:11.594 --> 02:46:12.696
BE ELIMINATED. NOW, WHAT WOULD

02:46:12.762 --> 02:46:15.699
WE BE ABLE TO DO IF WE GOT RID

02:46:15.765 --> 02:46:16.733
OF $400 MILLION FOR LEFT WING

02:46:16.800 --> 02:46:18.835
GROUPS, MANY OF WHICH ARE

02:46:18.902 --> 02:46:20.670
ATTACKING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND

02:46:20.737 --> 02:46:22.439
ORGANIZING PROTESTS, WE COULD

02:46:22.505 --> 02:46:24.140
ACTUALLY FULFILL THE COMMITMENT

02:46:24.207 --> 02:46:26.576
VOTERS MADE TO PUBLIC SAFETY BY

02:46:26.643 --> 02:46:30.046
FULLY FUNDING PROP 36. I

02:46:30.113 --> 02:46:31.648
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MY COLLEAGUES

02:46:31.715 --> 02:46:33.316
ON THE OTHER SIDE DID A MUCH

02:46:33.383 --> 02:46:34.684
BETTER JOB THAN THE GOVERNOR AT

02:46:34.751 --> 02:46:36.820
PROP 36 BY PROVIDING $85

02:46:36.886 --> 02:46:39.055
MILLION, BUT WE KNOW THE REAL

02:46:39.122 --> 02:46:42.158
COST IS AT LEAST $400 MILLION,

02:46:42.225 --> 02:46:43.660
AND WE OUGHT TO RESPECT THE

02:46:43.727 --> 02:46:47.330
VOTES OF CALIFORNIANS FOR PROP

02:46:47.397 --> 02:46:50.300
36 BY FULLY FUNDING IT. WE PROP

02:46:50.367 --> 02:46:51.768
UP THE FAILED HIGH SPEED RAIL

02:46:51.835 --> 02:46:54.371
PROJECT WITH $1 BILLION

02:46:54.437 --> 02:46:55.905
COMMITMENT THIS YEAR, AND THEN

02:46:55.972 --> 02:46:57.807
WE ALLOW THE GOVERNOR TO PROCEED

02:46:57.874 --> 02:46:59.843
FORWARD WITH HIS SCHEME, HIS

02:46:59.909 --> 02:47:03.146
SCAM TO TIE THE HANDS OF FUTURE

02:47:03.213 --> 02:47:05.315
LEGISLATORS, TO TIE THE HANDS OF

02:47:05.382 --> 02:47:08.151
FUTURE TAXPAYERS WITH A BOND

02:47:08.218 --> 02:47:11.020
PROGRAM SO THAT HIGH SPEED RAIL

02:47:11.087 --> 02:47:13.156
WILL CONTINUE ON INTO THE FUTURE

02:47:13.223 --> 02:47:15.425
WITHOUT ANY SORT OF OVERSIGHT OR

02:47:15.492 --> 02:47:17.627
INPUT FROM THIS BODY, WE WON'T

02:47:17.694 --> 02:47:21.097
BE ABLE TO STOP IT. AND FINALLY,

02:47:21.164 --> 02:47:22.198
WE KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE

02:47:22.265 --> 02:47:25.168
COMING BACK IN A FEW WEEKS OR

02:47:25.235 --> 02:47:26.469
MONTHS UNDER THE GUISE THAT

02:47:26.536 --> 02:47:28.772
DONALD TRUMP MADE US DO IT, THAT

02:47:28.838 --> 02:47:29.606
IT'S ALL TRUMP'S FAULT. THE

02:47:29.672 --> 02:47:31.908
BUDGET WAS NOT, YOU KNOW, A

02:47:31.975 --> 02:47:33.309
PROBLEM UNTIL DONALD TRUMP DID

02:47:33.376 --> 02:47:34.677
THIS, THAT OR THE OTHER THING,

02:47:34.744 --> 02:47:36.379
WHEN IN FACT, WE'VE HAD A FISCAL

02:47:36.446 --> 02:47:37.747
CRISIS FOR FIVE, SIX, SEVEN

02:47:37.814 --> 02:47:40.583
YEARS. THE COVID 19 BAILOUTS IN

02:47:40.650 --> 02:47:43.420
2020 AND 2021 JUST MASKED IT AND

02:47:43.486 --> 02:47:46.055
GAVE US A LIFELINE FOR A FEW FEW

02:47:46.122 --> 02:47:48.491
YEARS. BUT NOW THE BAR TAB IS

02:47:48.558 --> 02:47:51.027
COMING DUE. THE HANGOVER IS

02:47:51.094 --> 02:47:54.063
BEING FELT AND YOU KNOW TRUMP

02:47:54.130 --> 02:47:55.899
ISN'T GOING TO BAIL YOU OUT. SO

02:47:55.965 --> 02:47:57.500
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? YOU'RE

02:47:57.567 --> 02:47:59.169
GOING TO TURN TO THE CALIFORNIA

02:47:59.235 --> 02:48:00.837
TAXPAYERS AND SAY THAT IT'S TIME

02:48:00.904 --> 02:48:03.506
FOR A MASSIVE TAX INCREASE. I'M

02:48:03.573 --> 02:48:04.874
JUST SAYING IT TODAY SO THAT

02:48:04.941 --> 02:48:07.210
WHEN WE PULL THIS CLIP LATER ON,

02:48:07.277 --> 02:48:08.678
WE CAN SAY, WE TOLD YOU SO. YOU

02:48:08.745 --> 02:48:11.848
CAN'T BLAME TRUMP 30S IT WAS ALL

02:48:11.915 --> 02:48:13.716
YOUR OWN DOING. WITH A BAD

02:48:13.783 --> 02:48:16.820
BUDGET. ADOPTED ON JUNE 27TH,

02:48:16.886 --> 02:48:19.389
2025, OAN IT. IT'S NOW YOUR

02:48:19.456 --> 02:48:21.191
BUDGET CRISIS. I ASK FOR A NO

02:48:21.257 --> 02:48:23.026
VOTE ON AB 102. THANK YOU.

THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. I HAD NO

02:48:29.299 --> 02:48:30.934
PLANS TO SPEAK TODAY. I WAS

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:32.435
REALLY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS

02:48:32.502 --> 02:48:34.270
PROCESS. OUR CHAIR AND ALL THE

02:48:34.337 --> 02:48:35.538
GREAT WORK THAT HAS HAPPENED IN

02:48:35.605 --> 02:48:39.275
THIS PROCESS. BUT TODAY I RISE

02:48:39.342 --> 02:48:40.677
BECAUSE AS I VOTE FOR THIS

02:48:40.743 --> 02:48:44.280
SPECIFIC PART OF THE BUDGET, I

02:48:44.347 --> 02:48:48.251
REPRESENT A HIGH IMMIGRANT, HIGH

02:48:48.318 --> 02:48:50.753
UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITY. AND WHAT

02:48:50.820 --> 02:48:53.923
I DON'T FORGET IS MY LIVED

02:48:53.990 --> 02:48:56.226
EXPERIENCE. MY MOTHER, WHO I

02:48:56.292 --> 02:48:59.429
LOST FIVE YEARS AGO THIS AUGUST,

02:48:59.496 --> 02:49:05.869
WAS ONCE A DOCUMENTED MY MOTHER.

02:49:05.935 --> 02:49:08.171
IS ONE OF THE PEOPLE REPRESENTED

02:49:08.238 --> 02:49:11.374
IN THIS BUDGET. TODAY. MY MOTHER

02:49:11.441 --> 02:49:13.443
TOOK ME TO DENTIST APPOINTMENTS

02:49:13.510 --> 02:49:17.413
ON MEDICAL, ON MEDI-CAL. MY

02:49:17.480 --> 02:49:21.351
PARENTS ARE HARD WORKERS. THEY

02:49:21.417 --> 02:49:23.953
BENEFITED FROM AMNESTY. MY MOM

02:49:24.020 --> 02:49:26.689
WENT TO SCHOOL, LEARNED ENGLISH,

02:49:26.756 --> 02:49:28.157
AND WAS SO PROUD OF LEARNING

02:49:28.224 --> 02:49:30.393
ABOUT OUR HISTORY AND TOOK THAT

02:49:30.460 --> 02:49:32.829
EXAM AND BECAME A US CITIZEN.

02:49:32.896 --> 02:49:35.365
BUT BEFORE THAT, SHE WAS

02:49:35.431 --> 02:49:37.867
UNDOCUMENTED. SHE WAS A HUMAN

02:49:37.934 --> 02:49:42.572
BEING WHO LOVED HER CHILD, HER

02:49:42.639 --> 02:49:45.441
LITTLE JOSESITO, WHATEVER SHE

02:49:45.508 --> 02:49:50.079
CALLED ME. A SON OF IMMIGRANT

02:49:50.146 --> 02:49:52.482
PARENTS, PARENTS THAT LIVE IN

02:49:52.549 --> 02:49:55.618
LYNWOOD, CALIFORNIA, BELLFLOWER,

02:49:55.685 --> 02:49:58.421

MY DISTRICT YESTERDAY. AND I

02:50:04.994 --> 02:50:07.096
JUST WAS REMINDED OF WHO I

02:50:07.163 --> 02:50:08.898
REPRESENT EVERY SINGLE DAY. BUT

02:50:08.965 --> 02:50:10.700
STAYING FOCUSED ON TODAY'S

02:50:10.767 --> 02:50:13.169
CONVERSATION, I PROUDLY

02:50:13.236 --> 02:50:15.305
REPRESENT A COMUNIDAD WITH A LOT

02:50:15.371 --> 02:50:17.106
OF HEART THAT WHEN THEY GO TO

02:50:17.173 --> 02:50:19.409
THE CLINIC, THEY JUST WANT

02:50:19.475 --> 02:50:21.044
SERVICE. THEY WANT TO ATTEND

02:50:21.110 --> 02:50:23.479
THEIR CHILDREN'S MEDICAL NEEDS.

02:50:23.546 --> 02:50:26.883
THEIR GRANDPARENTS, THEIR, THEIR

02:50:26.950 --> 02:50:29.419
NEIGHBOR. SO TODAY, AS I VOTE

02:50:29.485 --> 02:50:30.820
FOR THIS BUDGET, MISTER CHAIR

02:50:30.887 --> 02:50:32.155
AND COLLEAGUES, I THINK OF MY

02:50:32.221 --> 02:50:35.224
MOM WHO WAS ONCE DOCUMENTED

02:50:35.291 --> 02:50:36.593
UNDOCUMENTED. BUT BEFORE SHE

02:50:36.659 --> 02:50:39.095
LEFT THIS WORLD, SHE WAS A PROUD

02:50:39.162 --> 02:50:42.198
AMERICAN AND SHE LOVED TO VOTE

02:50:42.265 --> 02:50:45.301
EVERY SINGLE TIME SHE COULD. SHE

02:50:45.368 --> 02:50:47.036
EARNED HER WAY TO WHERE SHE HAD

02:50:47.103 --> 02:50:49.939
BEFORE SHE LEFT, FROM

02:50:50.006 --> 02:50:52.408
UNDOCUMENTED TO A CITIZEN OF

02:50:52.475 --> 02:50:53.242
THIS BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY GAVE HER

02:50:53.309 --> 02:50:56.746
THAT OPPORTUNITY. AND SO AS

02:50:56.813 --> 02:50:59.682
PEOPLE LIKE TO USE OTHER TERMS,

02:50:59.749 --> 02:51:02.185
I RESPECTFULLY ASK MY COLLEAGUES

02:51:02.251 --> 02:51:05.054
THAT LET'S NOT FORGET THAT WE

02:51:05.121 --> 02:51:07.357
WERE ALL UNDOCUMENTED OR FROM

02:51:07.423 --> 02:51:09.392
ANOTHER COUNTRY ONE DAY. I WISH

02:51:09.459 --> 02:51:11.394
WE WERE ALL PURE NATIVE

02:51:11.461 --> 02:51:15.531
AMERICANS, BUT WE'RE NOT. WE'RE

02:51:15.598 --> 02:51:17.333
BEAUTIFUL. WE'RE DIFFERENT.

02:51:17.400 --> 02:51:18.635
WE'RE SHORT, WE'RE TALL, WE'RE

02:51:18.701 --> 02:51:21.471
FLUFFY, WE'RE SKINNY, WE'RE ALL

02:51:21.537 --> 02:51:23.439
BEAUTIFUL. AND AS I VOTE ON THIS

02:51:23.506 --> 02:51:25.008
BILL TODAY, IT'S NOT PERFECT.

02:51:25.074 --> 02:51:27.677
IT'S NOT LORD KNOWS IT'S NOT

02:51:27.744 --> 02:51:29.512
PERFECT. BUT WE HAVE A

02:51:29.579 --> 02:51:31.047
RESPONSIBILITY. AND I WILL

02:51:31.114 --> 02:51:33.116
PROUDLY CAST MY VOTE ON THAT

02:51:33.182 --> 02:51:34.550
GREEN BUTTON TODAY FOR MY

02:51:34.617 --> 02:51:37.320
MOTHER, FOR THAT GRANDMOTHER

02:51:37.387 --> 02:51:40.957
LIVES IN MY DISTRICT FOR EVERY

ALMOST 500,000 PEOPLE THAT I

02:51:42.592 --> 02:51:43.559
REPRESENT IN MY COMMUNITY,

02:51:43.626 --> 02:51:45.928
REGARDLESS OF HOW THEY IDENTIFY.

02:51:45.995 --> 02:51:46.929
BECAUSE AT THE END, THEY'RE

02:51:46.996 --> 02:51:47.864

SPEAKER. AND COLLEAGUES. I'LL BE

02:52:05.415 --> 02:52:07.316
VERY QUICK. FIRST, I WANT TO

02:52:07.383 --> 02:52:07.850
THANK OUR COLLEAGUE FROM

02:52:07.917 --> 02:52:09.318
PARAMOUNT FOR ALWAYS BEING HIS

02:52:09.385 --> 02:52:12.021
AUTHENTIC SELF AND REMINDING US

02:52:12.088 --> 02:52:13.690
OF OUR SHARED HUMANITY. I ALSO

02:52:13.756 --> 02:52:15.758
WANT TO THANK OUR COLLEAGUE FROM

02:52:15.825 --> 02:52:17.760
SAN DIEGO FOR REMINDING US THAT

02:52:17.827 --> 02:52:18.461
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE CLIP, AND

02:52:18.528 --> 02:52:20.496
BEING ABLE TO RUN IT BACK LATER.

02:52:20.563 --> 02:52:22.098
THAT WAS NOT SURPRISING TO US AT

02:52:22.165 --> 02:52:24.133
ALL. OF COURSE, OUR BUDGET IS

02:52:24.200 --> 02:52:24.667
IMPACTED BY THIS. FEDERAL

02:52:24.734 --> 02:52:26.135
ADMINISTRATION. FOR THE FIRST

02:52:26.202 --> 02:52:27.503
TIME IN THREE YEARS, THE US GDP

02:52:27.570 --> 02:52:29.238
HAS CONTRACTED DURING THE FIRST

02:52:29.305 --> 02:52:30.139
THREE MONTHS OF THIS PRESIDENCY.

02:52:30.206 --> 02:52:31.174
THERE ARE MANY, MANY FACTORS,

02:52:31.240 --> 02:52:32.742
INCLUDING THE TARIFFS, THE

02:52:32.809 --> 02:52:34.177
HAPHAZARD WASTE. LET'S NOT TALK

02:52:34.243 --> 02:52:35.611
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN LOS

02:52:35.678 --> 02:52:37.413
ANGELES. I RESENT THAT FROM

02:52:37.480 --> 02:52:38.548
SOMEBODY WHO HASN'T BEEN TO LOS

02:52:38.614 --> 02:52:40.116
ANGELES ALL YEAR, ESPECIALLY

02:52:40.183 --> 02:52:40.983
WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS

02:52:41.050 --> 02:52:41.884
SPENDING HUNDREDS OF MILLION

02:52:41.951 --> 02:52:43.686
DOLLARS THAT WE COULD BE

02:52:43.753 --> 02:52:45.488
SPENDING ON THE PEOPLE OF LOS

02:52:45.555 --> 02:52:46.122
ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, STEPPING UP

02:52:46.189 --> 02:52:47.223
TO FILL THOSE GAPS. AND ABOUT

02:52:47.290 --> 02:52:49.058
PROP 36, I HOPE OUR BUDGET CHAIR

02:52:49.125 --> 02:52:50.626
TALKS ABOUT THE FUNDING FOR PROP

02:52:50.693 --> 02:52:52.128
36 THAT'S IN THIS BUDGET,

02:52:52.195 --> 02:52:53.229
BECAUSE I AM GOING TO VOTE

02:52:53.296 --> 02:52:55.231
TODAY. BUT I DISAGREE WITH IT

02:52:55.298 --> 02:52:57.333
BECAUSE TAXPAYERS WERE LIED TO

02:52:57.400 --> 02:52:58.901
ALL. LAST YEAR DURING PROP 36,

02:52:58.968 --> 02:53:00.770
WE BLAMED POOR PEOPLE FOR

02:53:00.837 --> 02:53:01.904
STEALING TOOTHPASTE AND

02:53:01.971 --> 02:53:03.106
DEODORANT AND SUGGESTED THE

02:53:03.172 --> 02:53:04.474
SOLUTION WAS TO PUT THEM IN

02:53:04.540 --> 02:53:05.875
CAGES WITHOUT ANY FUNDING IN THE

02:53:05.942 --> 02:53:07.110
MEASURE WHATSOEVER. THE MEASURE

02:53:07.176 --> 02:53:09.112
DID NOT CALL FOR A SINGLE PENNY

02:53:09.178 --> 02:53:10.980
OF FUNDING, AND WE WARNED ABOUT

02:53:11.047 --> 02:53:13.216
THIS. WE SAID THIS WAS GOING TO

02:53:13.282 --> 02:53:14.484
COME OFF THE BACKS OF CHILDREN

02:53:14.550 --> 02:53:15.852
AND FAMILIES WHO ARE STRUGGLING.

02:53:15.918 --> 02:53:17.453
ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WE CAMPAIGNED

02:53:17.520 --> 02:53:18.821
ACROSS THE STATE TALKING ABOUT

02:53:18.888 --> 02:53:20.857
HOW RIGHTEOUS IT WAS TO PROTECT

02:53:20.923 --> 02:53:22.558
THE EVERYDAY AFFORDABILITY NEEDS

02:53:22.625 --> 02:53:24.127
OF FAMILIES AND NOT WASTE THAT

02:53:24.193 --> 02:53:25.695
MONEY PUTTING PEOPLE IN A CYCLE

02:53:25.762 --> 02:53:27.463
OF INCARCERATION THAT'S GOING TO

02:53:27.530 --> 02:53:28.598
PUT THEM RIGHT BACK OUT ON OUR

02:53:28.664 --> 02:53:29.632
STREETS, STRUGGLING. BUT VOTERS

02:53:29.699 --> 02:53:31.434
CHOSE DIFFERENTLY, AND WE'RE

02:53:31.501 --> 02:53:32.635
RESPECTING THAT. AND EVEN THOUGH

02:53:32.702 --> 02:53:34.537
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD PUT A

02:53:34.604 --> 02:53:35.505
PENNY TOWARDS THE IMPLEMENTATION

02:53:35.571 --> 02:53:37.140
OF PROP 36 BECAUSE WE SHOULD BE

02:53:37.206 --> 02:53:38.508
INVESTING IN FAMILIES, THIS

02:53:38.574 --> 02:53:40.877
BUDGET DOES IT NONETHELESS,

02:53:40.943 --> 02:53:41.778
BECAUSE WE HAVE A COLLABORATIVE

02:53:41.844 --> 02:53:43.379
CAUCUS AND BRILLIANT LEADERSHIP

02:53:43.446 --> 02:53:45.782
BY OUR BUDGET CHAIR. I HOPE HE

02:53:45.848 --> 02:53:46.415
GOES INTO THOSE DETAILS IN HIS

02:53:46.482 --> 02:53:48.918
CLOTHES, AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK

02:53:48.985 --> 02:53:49.786
FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU,

02:53:49.852 --> 02:53:51.654
ASSEMBLY MEMBER BRIAN. SEEING

02:53:51.721 --> 02:53:53.689
AND HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE.

02:53:53.756 --> 02:53:55.158
EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME, MR.

02:53:55.224 --> 02:53:56.259
PATTERSON. MR. PATTERSON, YOU

02:53:56.325 --> 02:53:59.162
ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU. I

02:53:59.228 --> 02:54:01.297
THINK I'M GOING TO START OFF

02:54:01.364 --> 02:54:01.831
WITH THE OBLIGATORY WHAT

02:54:01.898 --> 02:54:04.200
EVERYBODY ELSE SAYS. I WASN'T

02:54:04.267 --> 02:54:06.002
PLANNING ON SPEAKING, BUT ONCE

02:54:06.068 --> 02:54:07.837
MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES

02:54:07.904 --> 02:54:09.939
STOOD UP, IT IT SPARKED SOME

02:54:10.006 --> 02:54:12.408
IDEAS IN MY HEAD. SO THEY'RE NOT

02:54:12.475 --> 02:54:18.848
FINELY TUNED. YOU KNOW? TALK A

02:54:18.915 --> 02:54:20.683
SOME OF US LIKE TO SPEAK NOT

02:54:20.750 --> 02:54:22.585
ONLY BECAUSE WE MAKE CLIPS. BY

02:54:22.652 --> 02:54:24.020
THE WAY, IT'S NOT OUR CAUCUS,

02:54:24.086 --> 02:54:26.422
YOU KNOW, WITH CAMERAMEN ON THE

02:54:26.489 --> 02:54:29.058
FLOOR ZOOMING IN TO MAKE VIDEOS

02:54:29.125 --> 02:54:33.029
OF US. BUT, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A

02:54:33.095 --> 02:54:34.730
RIGHT TO OBVIOUSLY SHARE WITH

02:54:34.797 --> 02:54:35.832
OUR CONSTITUENTS THE VIDEOS THAT

02:54:35.898 --> 02:54:39.535
WE MAKE. BUT BUT BEYOND THAT, I

02:54:39.602 --> 02:54:40.903
DON'T THINK THE VOTERS WERE LIED

02:54:40.970 --> 02:54:43.906
TO WHEN IT CAME TO PROP 36

02:54:43.973 --> 02:54:45.741
UNLESS THEY WERE LIED TO. WITH

02:54:45.808 --> 02:54:47.743
EVERY STORE THEY WENT TO, THEY

02:54:47.810 --> 02:54:49.779
SAW SIMPLE ITEMS LOCKED UP

02:54:49.846 --> 02:54:51.414
UNLESS THEY WERE LIED TO.

02:54:51.480 --> 02:54:54.116
DRIVING DOWN THE STREET OF

02:54:54.183 --> 02:54:56.519
BASICALLY EVERY CITY AND SAW

02:54:56.586 --> 02:54:59.655
PEOPLE WHO NEEDED HELP, SOME

02:54:59.722 --> 02:55:02.992
PEOPLE WHO NEEDED ACCOUNTABILITY

02:55:03.059 --> 02:55:04.861
FOR THEIR ACTIONS. THOSE AREN'T

02:55:04.927 --> 02:55:07.263
LIES. PEOPLE SAW IT WITH THEIR

02:55:07.330 --> 02:55:11.033
OWN EYES. YOU KNOW, AND I AND I

02:55:11.100 --> 02:55:12.468
ALSO WAS LISTENING TO MY

02:55:12.535 --> 02:55:16.105
COLLEAGUE FROM PARAMOUNT, AND I,

02:55:16.172 --> 02:55:18.407
WE'LL SHARE A CONVERSATION

02:55:18.474 --> 02:55:20.076
SEPARATELY ABOUT IT. AND I

02:55:20.142 --> 02:55:21.010
UNDERSTAND WHAT HE'S TALKING

02:55:21.077 --> 02:55:22.278
ABOUT. LIKE I'VE MENTIONED

02:55:22.345 --> 02:55:23.746
BEFORE, THAT MY STEPDAD

02:55:23.813 --> 02:55:25.615
IMMIGRATED HERE FROM MEXICO AND

02:55:25.681 --> 02:55:28.718
HE TOO, NOW IS A CITIZEN OF THIS

02:55:28.784 --> 02:55:29.886
COUNTRY. AND ACTUALLY, HE'S

02:55:29.952 --> 02:55:32.455
LEAVING TODAY TO GO BACK TO HIS

02:55:32.521 --> 02:55:34.924
HOMETOWN OR HIS HOME STATE,

02:55:34.991 --> 02:55:37.460
GUANAJUATO, RIGHT NOW, ACTUALLY,

02:55:37.526 --> 02:55:40.196
WITH MY BROTHERS. BUT I THINK

02:55:40.263 --> 02:55:42.064
THE PROBLEM WITH MEDI-CAL AND I

02:55:42.131 --> 02:55:44.500
MEAN, WE HAVE A ANOTHER ITEM

02:55:44.567 --> 02:55:47.036
COMING UP ON OUR HEALTH CARE IS

02:55:47.103 --> 02:55:50.706
THAT WE ALREADY WEREN'T PROPERLY

02:55:50.773 --> 02:55:52.174
FUNDING MEDI-CAL IN THE FIRST

02:55:52.241 --> 02:55:55.077
PLACE, AND WE JUST ADDED

02:55:55.144 --> 02:55:56.445
MILLIONS OF MORE PEOPLE TO IT.

02:55:56.512 --> 02:55:58.414
RIGHT OR WRONG, YOU CAN DISAGREE

02:55:58.481 --> 02:56:00.716
OR AGREE WITH THE POLICY OF US

02:56:00.783 --> 02:56:03.319
DOING THAT, BUT EVERYBODY NOW IS

02:56:03.386 --> 02:56:06.555
GETTING LACKLUSTER SUPPORT FROM

02:56:06.622 --> 02:56:07.857
MEDI-CAL. WE'VE UNDERFUNDED

02:56:07.924 --> 02:56:09.825
MEDI-CAL FOR DECADES. ACTUALLY,

02:56:09.892 --> 02:56:11.560
WHEN I WAS A STAFF PERSON HERE

02:56:11.627 --> 02:56:13.796
20 YEARS AGO, IT WAS WHAT WE

02:56:13.863 --> 02:56:15.898
WERE TALKING ABOUT. BUT NOT ONLY

02:56:15.965 --> 02:56:16.666
ARE WE UNDERFUNDING IT, WE DON'T

02:56:16.732 --> 02:56:18.901
HAVE ENOUGH PROVIDERS. AND SO

02:56:18.968 --> 02:56:21.437
THE ACCESS FOR EVERYBODY, EVEN

02:56:21.504 --> 02:56:22.805
PEOPLE WITH HEALTH INSURANCE

02:56:22.872 --> 02:56:23.806
THAT ARE PAYING FOR IT THROUGH

02:56:23.873 --> 02:56:25.574
THEIR EMPLOYER, YOU CAN'T FIND A

02:56:25.641 --> 02:56:27.109
PROVIDER, GO THROUGH MEDI-CAL

02:56:27.176 --> 02:56:28.911
DIRECTORY AND TRY TO FIND A

02:56:28.978 --> 02:56:30.613
DOCTOR, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE AN

02:56:30.680 --> 02:56:32.214
INDIVIDUAL WITH A DISABILITY OR

02:56:32.281 --> 02:56:34.283
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. BUT I THINK

02:56:34.350 --> 02:56:36.519
IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO ARGUE

02:56:36.585 --> 02:56:38.220
TO ADD A LOT OF PEOPLE TO THE

02:56:38.287 --> 02:56:40.089
MEDI-CAL SYSTEM WHEN WE WEREN'T

02:56:40.156 --> 02:56:41.590
WERE NOT PROVIDING THE CARE THAT

02:56:41.657 --> 02:56:43.359
WE NEED ALL THE WAY. AND THAT'S

02:56:43.426 --> 02:56:45.661
THE FAIR. THAT'S A FAIR DEBATE.

02:56:45.728 --> 02:56:47.229
THAT'S A DEBATE WE SHOULD HAVE

02:56:47.296 --> 02:56:48.664
IN THIS STATE, NO MATTER WHAT.

02:56:48.731 --> 02:56:49.465
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT ADDING

02:56:49.532 --> 02:56:50.967
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO THE ROLLS.

02:56:51.033 --> 02:56:53.703
SO I DON'T REALLY LIKE THAT TO

02:56:53.769 --> 02:56:55.571
BE DISMISSED. AND NOT SAYING MY

02:56:55.638 --> 02:56:56.672
COLLEAGUE FROM PARAMOUNT WAS

02:56:56.739 --> 02:56:57.740
DISMISSING THAT CONCERN, BUT

02:56:57.807 --> 02:56:59.875
THAT'S A REAL DISCUSSION WE NEED

02:56:59.942 --> 02:57:03.245
TO HAVE IF THIS BODY INTENDS TO

02:57:03.312 --> 02:57:05.281
CONTINUE TO ADD PEOPLE TO

02:57:05.348 --> 02:57:07.316
MEDI-CAL ROLLS. WITH THAT, I

02:57:07.383 --> 02:57:08.617
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE.

02:57:08.684 --> 02:57:10.019
THANK YOU, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:57:10.086 --> 02:57:11.887

HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE,

02:57:13.022 --> 02:57:14.557
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL, DO YOU

02:57:14.623 --> 02:57:15.725
WISH TO CLOSE? YEAH, THANK YOU

02:57:15.791 --> 02:57:17.526
VERY MUCH, MR. SPEAKER. I WANT

02:57:17.593 --> 02:57:19.328
TO THANK SO MANY OF OUR

02:57:19.395 --> 02:57:20.796
COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR FOR THEIR

02:57:20.863 --> 02:57:21.897
THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS. I WANT TO

02:57:21.964 --> 02:57:23.966
THANK OUR COLLEAGUE FROM LINWOOD

02:57:24.033 --> 02:57:25.067
FOR SHARING SUCH HEARTFELT

02:57:25.134 --> 02:57:25.935
REMARKS. I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE

02:57:26.002 --> 02:57:28.270
HOW PROUD YOUR MOM MUST BE OF

02:57:28.337 --> 02:57:29.372
YOU. AND KNOWING THAT YOU'RE

02:57:29.438 --> 02:57:30.406
HERE ON THE FLOOR, REPRESENTING

02:57:30.473 --> 02:57:31.807
YOUR COMMUNITY SO ABLY. SO THANK

02:57:31.874 --> 02:57:33.376
YOU FOR THAT. THANK YOU ALSO TO

02:57:33.442 --> 02:57:35.378
OUR COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES.

02:57:35.444 --> 02:57:38.047
SINCE SINCE THE PROP 36

02:57:38.114 --> 02:57:39.615
CONVERSATION CAME UP. I DO THINK

02:57:39.682 --> 02:57:41.283
IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE I THINK

02:57:41.350 --> 02:57:41.917
THERE'S A NARRATIVE OUT THERE,

02:57:41.984 --> 02:57:43.819
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO OUR

02:57:43.886 --> 02:57:44.553
COLLEAGUES FROM ORANGE COUNTY,

02:57:44.620 --> 02:57:45.955
THAT IS SIMPLY NOT ACCURATE.

02:57:46.022 --> 02:57:48.591
IT'S NOT IT IS NOT CONSISTENT

02:57:48.657 --> 02:57:50.493
WITH WHAT'S IN THIS BUDGET. AND,

02:57:50.559 --> 02:57:52.395
YOU KNOW, AS OUR COLLEAGUE

02:57:52.461 --> 02:57:53.763
MENTIONED, THERE ARE THERE WERE

02:57:53.829 --> 02:57:54.630
DIFFERENCES OF OPINION IN THE

02:57:54.697 --> 02:57:55.598
DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS ABOUT

02:57:55.664 --> 02:57:57.233
PROPOSITION 36 AND THAT TOOK

02:57:57.299 --> 02:57:59.268
PLACE OUTSIDE THE BUILDING. BUT

02:57:59.335 --> 02:58:00.503
WHAT IS WHAT IS SINCERE IS A

02:58:00.569 --> 02:58:01.637
COMMITMENT TO HONOR THE WILL OF

02:58:01.704 --> 02:58:04.340
THE VOTERS AND TO DEEPLY HONOR

02:58:04.407 --> 02:58:05.441
THE WILL OF THE VOTERS. AND

02:58:05.508 --> 02:58:07.510
THAT'S WHY THIS BUDGET HAS ABOUT

02:58:07.576 --> 02:58:08.744
$350 MILLION IN IT IN VARIOUS

02:58:08.811 --> 02:58:09.979
WAYS THAT ARE LINKED TO

02:58:10.046 --> 02:58:11.147
PROPOSITION 36. THAT INCLUDES 50

02:58:11.213 --> 02:58:12.481
MILLION FOR COUNTY BEHAVIORAL

02:58:12.548 --> 02:58:14.450
HEALTH GRANTS, $20 MILLION FOR

02:58:14.517 --> 02:58:16.952
INCREASED JUDICIAL WORKLOAD, 15

02:58:17.019 --> 02:58:18.320
MILLION FOR PRETRIAL SERVICES,

02:58:18.387 --> 02:58:21.223
30 MILLION FOR CDCR, 127 MILLION

02:58:21.290 --> 02:58:23.325
TO THE BOARD OF STATE AND

02:58:23.392 --> 02:58:23.893
COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS GRANT

02:58:23.959 --> 02:58:25.227
FUNDING THAT HAS ALREADY GONE

02:58:25.294 --> 02:58:27.396
OUT IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR. I

02:58:27.463 --> 02:58:27.997
KNOW THAT OUR PUBLIC SAFETY

02:58:28.064 --> 02:58:29.131
CHAIR TALKED ABOUT THAT IN

02:58:29.198 --> 02:58:30.266
COMMITTEE. THE MONEY THAT'S

02:58:30.332 --> 02:58:31.367
ALREADY GONE OUT AND ANOTHER 90

02:58:31.434 --> 02:58:33.369
MILLION THAT'S GOING TO GO OUT

02:58:33.436 --> 02:58:34.537
FOR GRANTS NEXT YEAR FOR

02:58:34.603 --> 02:58:35.538
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AND

02:58:35.604 --> 02:58:36.539
MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT

02:58:36.605 --> 02:58:37.640
PROGRAMS. SO YOU ARE ENTITLED TO

02:58:37.706 --> 02:58:39.308
YOUR OWN OPINIONS, BUT YOU'RE

02:58:39.375 --> 02:58:40.543
NOT ENTITLED TO YOUR OWN SET OF

02:58:40.609 --> 02:58:42.445
FACTS. AND THE FACTS ARE CLEAR

02:58:42.511 --> 02:58:43.646
IN THIS BUDGET THAT THERE IS

02:58:43.712 --> 02:58:45.514
FUNDING FOR PROPOSITION 36. THAT

02:58:45.581 --> 02:58:45.981
IS SOMETHING THAT THE

02:58:46.048 --> 02:58:47.116
LEGISLATURE DID, DID, DID THE

02:58:47.183 --> 02:58:49.385
WORK OF PUTTING INTO THE BUDGET.

02:58:49.452 --> 02:58:50.753
AND I REALLY HOPE PEOPLE WILL

02:58:50.820 --> 02:58:51.821
TAKE THE TIME TO EDUCATE

02:58:51.887 --> 02:58:52.455
THEMSELVES ON WHAT IS IN THIS

02:58:52.521 --> 02:58:53.756
BUDGET, BECAUSE IS IT

02:58:53.823 --> 02:58:55.291
IRRESPONSIBLE AND NOT ACCURATE

02:58:55.357 --> 02:58:56.759
TO GO OUT AND TELL PEOPLE

02:58:56.826 --> 02:58:57.660
SOMETHING THAT SIMPLY ISN'T

02:58:57.726 --> 02:59:00.196
TRUE? WITH THAT, LET ME SPEAK

02:59:00.262 --> 02:59:01.564
MORE BROADLY. I KNOW THERE'S

02:59:01.630 --> 02:59:03.432
BEEN A LOT OF CONVERSATION. THIS

02:59:03.499 --> 02:59:05.401
HAS BEEN A TOUGH AND CHALLENGING

02:59:05.468 --> 02:59:06.569
PROCESS. AND AGAIN, OUR

02:59:06.635 --> 02:59:07.736
COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES

02:59:07.803 --> 02:59:08.838
HIGHLIGHTED THE FACT THAT WHAT

02:59:08.904 --> 02:59:10.372
HAS MADE THIS PROCESS INHERENTLY

02:59:10.439 --> 02:59:11.907
TOUGHER IS THE THREATS FROM

02:59:11.974 --> 02:59:12.975
WASHINGTON THAT HAVE ALREADY

02:59:13.042 --> 02:59:14.577
IMPACTED US. WE HAVE ALL WATCHED

02:59:14.643 --> 02:59:16.745
THE CHAOS, THE ECONOMIC CHAOS

02:59:16.812 --> 02:59:18.080
AND THE POLITICAL CHAOS IN

02:59:18.147 --> 02:59:19.849
WASHINGTON, D.C. SOMEBODY

02:59:19.915 --> 02:59:21.250
ANNOUNCES TARIFFS IN THE MORNING

02:59:21.317 --> 02:59:23.085
AND BY LUNCH, WE'RE IN A TOTALLY

02:59:23.152 --> 02:59:24.520
DIFFERENT DIRECTION. AND THE WAY

02:59:24.587 --> 02:59:25.754
THAT HAS IMPACTED THE CALIFORNIA

02:59:25.821 --> 02:59:27.556
ECONOMY, THE WAY THAT HAS

02:59:27.623 --> 02:59:28.457
IMPACTED THE US ECONOMY, THE WAY

02:59:28.524 --> 02:59:29.992
THAT HAS IMPACTED OUR REVENUES,

02:59:30.059 --> 02:59:32.027
IS A CHALLENGE. AND WE KNOW IF

02:59:32.094 --> 02:59:33.629
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PROTECTING

02:59:33.696 --> 02:59:35.464
CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS, THEN THE

02:59:35.531 --> 02:59:36.398
SINGLE GREATEST THING THAT YOU

02:59:36.465 --> 02:59:38.601
CAN DO IS GO TO WASHINGTON AND

02:59:38.667 --> 02:59:39.802
TELL THEM NOT TO PASS THE

02:59:39.869 --> 02:59:41.137
LEGISLATION THAT THEY ARE

02:59:41.203 --> 02:59:41.804
CONTEMPLATING, BECAUSE THAT WILL

02:59:41.871 --> 02:59:43.639
FORCE US TO COME BACK AND REDO

02:59:43.706 --> 02:59:45.541
THIS BUDGET. IT WILL DEVASTATE

02:59:45.608 --> 02:59:46.876
COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA,

02:59:46.942 --> 02:59:48.344
BY THE WAY. IT WILL DEVASTATE A

02:59:48.410 --> 02:59:50.212
LOT OF RED COMMUNITIES. IT WILL

02:59:50.279 --> 02:59:51.313
DEVASTATE A LOT OF YOUR

02:59:51.380 --> 02:59:52.414
CONSTITUENTS. AND I KNOW THAT

02:59:52.481 --> 02:59:54.383
YOU ALL KNOW THAT. SO IF YOU

02:59:54.450 --> 02:59:55.651
CARE ABOUT CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS,

02:59:55.718 --> 02:59:57.286
YOU WILL TALK TO YOUR YOUR

02:59:57.353 --> 02:59:58.053
COLLEAGUES IN WASHINGTON AND BEG

02:59:58.120 --> 02:59:59.922
THEM AND PLEAD WITH THEM NOT TO

02:59:59.989 --> 03:00:00.856
MOVE FORWARD WITH WHAT THEY'RE

03:00:00.923 --> 03:00:02.691
DOING, BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IT

03:00:02.758 --> 03:00:04.260
IS NOT WASHINGTON THAT'S BAILING

03:00:04.326 --> 03:00:06.462
OUT CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA HAS

03:00:06.529 --> 03:00:08.264
BEEN BAILING OUT WASHINGTON,

03:00:08.330 --> 03:00:10.232
D.C. WE ARE THE LARGEST DONOR

03:00:10.299 --> 03:00:13.235
STATE BY BY MANY ORDERS OF

03:00:13.302 --> 03:00:14.603
MAGNITUDE. HARDWORKING

03:00:14.670 --> 03:00:16.572
CALIFORNIANS ARE PAYING TAXES

03:00:16.639 --> 03:00:17.406
THAT FOLKS IN WASHINGTON ARE

03:00:17.473 --> 03:00:19.241
SENDING TO OTHER STATES. SO I

03:00:19.308 --> 03:00:21.610
HOPE THAT YOU WILL JOIN WITH US

03:00:21.677 --> 03:00:22.144
IN OPPOSING WHAT FOLKS IN

03:00:22.211 --> 03:00:24.313
WASHINGTON ARE TRYING TO DO AND

03:00:24.380 --> 03:00:25.614
MAKE SURE THAT TOGETHER, WE'RE

03:00:25.681 --> 03:00:26.315
STANDING UP FOR COMMUNITIES

03:00:26.382 --> 03:00:27.416
ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

03:00:27.483 --> 03:00:28.884

ADVANTAGE OF HAVING ALL THESE

MINI BILLS IS THAT WE CAN HAVE A

03:02:54.697 --> 03:02:56.265

TOP LINES WITH ASSEMBLY BILL

03:03:00.202 --> 03:03:01.770
102. BUT ON 116, AS WE TALK

03:03:01.837 --> 03:03:03.505
ABOUT THESE HEALTH CARE ISSUES,

03:03:03.572 --> 03:03:05.307

HOLD MORE SEATS THAN OUR CAUCUS

03:03:23.926 --> 03:03:27.496
DOES. YOU HAVE THE VOTES. BUT

03:03:27.563 --> 03:03:30.499
THAT DOES NOT MEAN WE GET TO BE

03:03:30.566 --> 03:03:33.702
DEPRIVED OF A VOICE. AND

03:03:33.769 --> 03:03:36.271
FRANKLY, I HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO

03:03:36.338 --> 03:03:39.875

IS WHAT WE CALL A DEMOCRACY. AND

03:03:49.651 --> 03:03:51.286
I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE THROW

03:03:51.353 --> 03:03:53.155
THAT TERM AROUND. WE HAVE A

03:03:53.222 --> 03:03:54.223
DEMOCRACY. LOOK WHAT LOOK AT THE

03:03:54.289 --> 03:03:55.891
PEOPLE IN THE STREETS ARE DOING.

03:03:55.958 --> 03:03:57.726
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE THIS IS A

03:03:57.793 --> 03:04:00.763
DEMOCRACY. WE SHOULD DEFEND IT.

03:04:00.829 --> 03:04:01.797
ABSOLUTELY. AS LONG AS THEY

03:04:01.864 --> 03:04:03.866
REMAIN PEACEFUL, THEY HAVE A

03:04:03.932 --> 03:04:05.334
FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT TO VOICE

03:04:05.401 --> 03:04:07.836
THEIR POINT OF VIEW, EVEN IF I

03:04:07.903 --> 03:04:09.671
DISAGREE WITH THEM. I HAVE

03:04:09.738 --> 03:04:13.275
ALWAYS HELD THAT POINT OF VIEW.

03:04:13.342 --> 03:04:15.310
MY HOPE IS THAT SOME OF YOU WILL

03:04:15.377 --> 03:04:18.046
DO THE SAME, AND I DON'T KNOW IF

03:04:18.113 --> 03:04:19.748
IT WILL SET IN. AND AGAIN,

03:04:19.815 --> 03:04:22.050
THAT'S NOT UP TO ME. IT'S

03:04:22.117 --> 03:04:23.585
ULTIMATELY UP TO YOUR VOTERS

03:04:23.652 --> 03:04:24.386
WHEN THEY HEAR THE OPPOSITION

03:04:24.453 --> 03:04:25.687
VOICE A CONCERN ABOUT SOMETHING

03:04:25.754 --> 03:04:28.757
THAT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN IS OUR

03:04:28.824 --> 03:04:30.359
OBLIGATION TO SPEAK UP AND VOICE

03:04:30.426 --> 03:04:31.660
THAT CONCERN, WHETHER YOU LIKE

03:04:31.727 --> 03:04:33.595
IT OR NOT, WHETHER YOU TAKE IT

03:04:33.662 --> 03:04:35.631
INTO ACCOUNT OR NOT, I DON'T

03:04:35.697 --> 03:04:37.499
KNOW, BUT IT IS MY JOB AND I'M

03:04:37.566 --> 03:04:38.834
GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO MY JOB.

03:04:38.901 --> 03:04:41.770
AND YES, I HOPE THAT CALIFORNIA

03:04:41.837 --> 03:04:44.273
VOTERS AND RESIDENTS PAY MORE

03:04:44.339 --> 03:04:45.407
ATTENTION TO WHAT'S HAPPENING

03:04:45.474 --> 03:04:47.576
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS IN THIS

03:04:47.643 --> 03:04:48.877
BUILDING BECAUSE IT HAS A

03:04:48.944 --> 03:04:51.180
PROFOUND IMPACT ON THEIR LIVES

03:04:51.246 --> 03:04:55.083
DAY IN AND DAY OUT. WIENER POINT

03:04:55.150 --> 03:04:56.919
ASSEMBLY MEMBER WILSON. THANK

03:04:56.985 --> 03:04:59.488
YOU. MR. THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER.

03:04:59.555 --> 03:05:02.057
I'VE YET TO HEAR MY COLLEAGUE

03:05:02.124 --> 03:05:04.526
SPEAK TO THE MERITS OF THE BILL.

03:05:04.593 --> 03:05:06.061
AND SO IF YOU CAN STICK TO AB

03:05:06.128 --> 03:05:07.763
116, I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT.

03:05:07.830 --> 03:05:09.431
THANK YOU, MR. DE MAYO. THANK

03:05:09.498 --> 03:05:12.334
YOU. THANK YOU. MR. YOUR POINT

03:05:12.401 --> 03:05:13.502
IS WELL TAKEN, BUT I THINK

03:05:13.569 --> 03:05:15.804
YOU'RE GETTING TO THE POINT.

03:05:15.871 --> 03:05:17.406
CORRECT, MR. DE MAYO YES, THANK

03:05:17.473 --> 03:05:18.140
YOU, MR. SPEAKER. I'M JUST

03:05:18.207 --> 03:05:19.441
RESPONDING TO SOME OF THE OTHER

03:05:19.508 --> 03:05:21.877
POINTS RAISED ON AB 102 SINCE

03:05:21.944 --> 03:05:23.512
THIS IS AN OVERALL PACKAGE OF

03:05:23.579 --> 03:05:28.317
BILLS FOR THE BUDGET. I WANT

03:05:28.383 --> 03:05:29.284
CALIFORNIANS TO PAY MORE

03:05:29.351 --> 03:05:30.419
ATTENTION TO WHAT'S GOING ON IN

03:05:30.486 --> 03:05:32.287
THIS BUILDING. AND THAT'S WHY I

03:05:32.354 --> 03:05:35.791
DO REFERENCE CLIPS, BECAUSE THEY

03:05:35.858 --> 03:05:37.092
NEED TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON

03:05:37.159 --> 03:05:38.994
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. AND MANY

03:05:39.061 --> 03:05:39.761
TIMES THEY'RE BUSY WITH THEIR

03:05:39.828 --> 03:05:41.563
LIVES. AND THAT'S AGAIN, THAT'S

03:05:41.630 --> 03:05:44.066
THEIR RIGHT. IT'S OUR JOB TO DO

03:05:44.132 --> 03:05:45.200
THIS. BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT

03:05:45.267 --> 03:05:47.169
THAT THEY KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING

03:05:47.236 --> 03:05:49.371
ON THEIR BEHALF IN THIS

03:05:49.438 --> 03:05:49.905
BUILDING. AND I WILL NOT

03:05:49.972 --> 03:05:51.607
APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. AND IF YOU

03:05:51.673 --> 03:05:53.742
WANT TO CRITICIZE ME FOR THAT,

03:05:53.809 --> 03:05:54.843
THAT'S AGAIN, YOU'RE RIGHT. AS

03:05:54.910 --> 03:05:56.979
IT RELATES TO ASSEMBLY BILL 116

03:05:57.045 --> 03:05:59.414
ON HEALTH CARE, I RAISED MY

03:05:59.481 --> 03:06:00.649
POINTS ABOUT THE ILLEGAL

03:06:00.716 --> 03:06:02.618
IMMIGRANT HEALTH CARE FUNDING TO

03:06:02.684 --> 03:06:05.220
MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES.

03:06:05.287 --> 03:06:07.723
WE HAVE ALL EXPRESSED OUR

03:06:07.789 --> 03:06:09.291
SUPPORT FOR IMMIGRANTS. LET'S BE

03:06:09.358 --> 03:06:11.126
VERY CLEAR. THIS IS NOT ABOUT

03:06:11.193 --> 03:06:12.461
WHETHER YOU SUPPORT OR OPPOSE

03:06:12.528 --> 03:06:13.929
IMMIGRANTS. WE ARE A NATION OF

03:06:13.996 --> 03:06:16.131
IMMIGRANTS. WE VALUE THAT WE ARE

03:06:16.198 --> 03:06:18.667
STRONGER BECAUSE OF IT. WHAT

03:06:18.734 --> 03:06:20.469
THIS IS ABOUT IS WHETHER SOMEONE

03:06:20.536 --> 03:06:22.070
SHOULD BE ABLE TO COME HERE

03:06:22.137 --> 03:06:24.673
ILLEGALLY, NOT GO THROUGH THE

03:06:24.740 --> 03:06:28.310
PROCESS, AND THEN BE GIVEN

03:06:28.377 --> 03:06:30.812
TAXPAYER FUNDS. THAT'S WHAT THIS

03:06:30.879 --> 03:06:32.614
DEBATE IS ABOUT. IT'S NOT

03:06:32.681 --> 03:06:34.049
WHETHER WE VALUE YOUR YOUR

03:06:34.116 --> 03:06:35.384
MOTHER, WHETHER WE VALUE

03:06:35.450 --> 03:06:37.352
IMMIGRANTS. WE DO. AND LET'S BE

03:06:37.419 --> 03:06:39.721
VERY CLEAR ABOUT THIS. BUT I

03:06:39.788 --> 03:06:41.623
THINK A LOT OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE

03:06:41.690 --> 03:06:43.825
CONCERNS ABOUT PRIORITIZING

03:06:43.892 --> 03:06:46.695
NONCITIZENS WITH SCARCE TAXPAYER

03:06:46.762 --> 03:06:47.863
RESOURCES. AT THE SAME TIME THAT

03:06:47.930 --> 03:06:50.299
WE'RE CUTTING SERVICES FOR THE

03:06:50.365 --> 03:06:52.067
NEEDIEST CITIZENS IN OUR

03:06:52.134 --> 03:06:53.101
COMMUNITIES, THAT IS WHAT OUR

03:06:53.168 --> 03:06:54.636
CONCERN IS ABOUT. IF THAT'S

03:06:54.703 --> 03:06:56.438
BEING LOST IN TRANSLATION, I

03:06:56.505 --> 03:06:59.308
WANT TO RISE AND SAY ON THIS

03:06:59.374 --> 03:07:01.076
BILL, WE DO NOT AGREE THAT WE

03:07:01.143 --> 03:07:03.078
SHOULD BE GIVING $12 BILLION IN

03:07:03.145 --> 03:07:06.648
THIS BILL, ASSEMBLY BILL 116 TO

03:07:06.715 --> 03:07:07.516
NONCITIZENS FOR FREE HEALTH

03:07:07.583 --> 03:07:09.484
CARE. BECAUSE WHAT IT MEANS IS

03:07:09.551 --> 03:07:11.353
THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A

03:07:11.420 --> 03:07:12.621
DEFICIT. WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT

03:07:12.688 --> 03:07:14.122
MEDI-CAL PUT AT RISK. WHAT IT

03:07:14.189 --> 03:07:15.891
MEANS IS THAT, AS MR. PATTERSON

03:07:15.958 --> 03:07:17.526
POINTS OUT, PEOPLE WILL HAVE A

03:07:17.593 --> 03:07:18.860
LONGER WAIT TIME FOR LIFE SAVING

03:07:18.927 --> 03:07:20.596
MEDICAL CARE. WHAT IT MEANS IS

03:07:20.662 --> 03:07:22.764
THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE BACK

03:07:22.831 --> 03:07:24.232
CUTTING MORE HEALTH CARE

03:07:24.299 --> 03:07:25.167
SERVICES, AND WHAT IT MEANS IS

03:07:25.233 --> 03:07:26.435
THAT WE ALREADY ARE CUTTING

03:07:26.501 --> 03:07:28.103
HEALTH CARE SERVICES. 30S AS AN

03:07:28.170 --> 03:07:31.340
EXAMPLE, IN AB 116, AND I'M

03:07:31.406 --> 03:07:33.675
HOPING THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO

03:07:33.742 --> 03:07:36.311
FIX THIS. WE REQUIRE PRIOR

03:07:36.378 --> 03:07:38.313
AUTHORIZATION FOR HOSPICE. WHAT

03:07:38.380 --> 03:07:40.382
IT MEANS IS THAT A DYING PATIENT

03:07:40.449 --> 03:07:43.385
IN A HOSPITAL WILL BE TOLD, STAY

03:07:43.452 --> 03:07:45.387
IN THAT HOSPITAL ROOM AT A MUCH

03:07:45.454 --> 03:07:47.522
HIGHER COST TO MEDI-CAL, A MUCH

03:07:47.589 --> 03:07:50.792
HIGHER COST TO TAXPAYERS. WHILE

03:07:50.859 --> 03:07:52.327
BUREAUCRATS DEBATE WHETHER WE'RE

03:07:52.394 --> 03:07:53.662
GOING TO GIVE AUTHORIZATION FOR

03:07:53.729 --> 03:07:55.364
HOSPICE, THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT

03:07:55.430 --> 03:07:56.932
GOOD BUDGET PRACTICE. IT'S GOING

03:07:56.999 --> 03:07:59.468
TO COST US MORE MONEY, BUT

03:07:59.534 --> 03:08:01.136
WORSE, WHEN YOUR LOVED ONE IS

03:08:01.203 --> 03:08:04.106
DYING, YOU DON'T WANT TO BE IN A

03:08:04.172 --> 03:08:04.906
HOSPITAL ROOM. YOU WANT THEM TO

03:08:04.973 --> 03:08:07.342
BE COMFORTABLE AT HOME. AND

03:08:07.409 --> 03:08:08.777
THAT'S WHAT THIS PROVISION IS

03:08:08.844 --> 03:08:10.345
GOING TO TAKE AWAY FROM THOSE

03:08:10.412 --> 03:08:12.080
FAMILIES AND THOSE DYING

03:08:12.147 --> 03:08:13.281
PATIENTS. THANK YOU. MR. I URGE

03:08:13.348 --> 03:08:15.450
YOU TO GO BACK AND REVISIT THAT

03:08:15.517 --> 03:08:17.152
PROVISION. I KNOW THAT WE'RE NOT

03:08:17.219 --> 03:08:18.420
GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IT TODAY

03:08:18.487 --> 03:08:20.389
BECAUSE OF THE ACTION BY THE

03:08:20.455 --> 03:08:22.224
SENATE, BUT I URGE YOU TO PLEASE

03:08:22.290 --> 03:08:23.892
RAISE THIS WITH THE GOVERNOR.

03:08:23.959 --> 03:08:25.427
PLEASE RAISE IT WITH BUDGET

03:08:25.494 --> 03:08:26.061
DISCUSSIONS AS WE COME BACK AND

03:08:26.128 --> 03:08:27.529
ADJUST THE BUDGET THROUGHOUT THE

03:08:27.596 --> 03:08:28.463
YEAR. THANK YOU, ASSEMBLYMEMBER,

03:08:28.530 --> 03:08:29.765
AND A KIND REMINDER TO PLEASE

03:08:29.831 --> 03:08:31.900
REFER TO MEMBERS BY THEIR

03:08:31.967 --> 03:08:33.035
DISTRICTS AS OPPOSED TO THEIR

03:08:33.101 --> 03:08:34.903
NAMES. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RANSOM,

03:08:34.970 --> 03:08:36.471
YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU,

03:08:36.538 --> 03:08:39.007
MR. SPEAKER. I THINK IT'S VERY

03:08:39.074 --> 03:08:40.042
IMPORTANT AS WE'RE HAVING THESE

03:08:40.108 --> 03:08:41.176
CONVERSATIONS AND WE'RE TALKING

03:08:41.243 --> 03:08:42.811
ABOUT CLIPS, THAT WE PAINT A

03:08:42.878 --> 03:08:45.781
FULL PICTURE. WE HAVE A REALLY

03:08:45.847 --> 03:08:47.349
TOUGH JOB AND REALLY TOUGH

03:08:47.416 --> 03:08:49.518
DECISIONS THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE,

03:08:49.584 --> 03:08:50.185
AND WE'RE TRYING TO BALANCE THE

03:08:50.252 --> 03:08:53.021
BUDGET. WHILE PEOPLE AT HOME ARE

03:08:53.088 --> 03:08:53.588
STRUGGLING TO BALANCE THEIR

03:08:53.655 --> 03:08:54.956
BUDGET AS WELL. WHEN WE HEAR THE

03:08:55.023 --> 03:08:56.558
CONVERSATIONS HERE ON THE FLOOR,

03:08:56.625 --> 03:08:58.860
WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT THE

03:08:58.927 --> 03:09:00.262
UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE AND THEIR

03:09:00.328 --> 03:09:01.663
IMPACT. BUT WE'RE NOT TALKING

03:09:01.730 --> 03:09:04.466
ABOUT THE TENS OF BILLIONS OF

03:09:04.533 --> 03:09:06.635
DOLLARS THAT ARE BEING PAID IN

03:09:06.702 --> 03:09:08.537
TAXES FOR PEOPLE WHO CANNOT

03:09:08.603 --> 03:09:11.006
ACCESS SERVICES. WE ONLY TALK

03:09:11.073 --> 03:09:13.275
ABOUT THIS ONE WAY. WE TALK

03:09:13.341 --> 03:09:15.377
ABOUT THE UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE

03:09:15.444 --> 03:09:17.846
AND THEIR IMPACTS ON OUR SYSTEM.

03:09:17.913 --> 03:09:19.448
SO AS WE VOTE ON THIS BUDGET,

03:09:19.514 --> 03:09:20.882
WE'VE MADE TOUGH CUTS THAT GO

03:09:20.949 --> 03:09:23.251
ALL THE WAY AROUND. AND WHILE

03:09:23.318 --> 03:09:23.885
MANY OF THESE ARE NECESSARY TO

03:09:23.952 --> 03:09:25.821
KEEP THE LIGHTS ON AND TO KEEP,

03:09:25.887 --> 03:09:28.390
YOU KNOW, KEEP PEOPLE SAFE,

03:09:28.457 --> 03:09:30.258
THERE ARE CONCERNING CUTS TO

03:09:30.325 --> 03:09:31.927
MEDI-CAL THAT I THINK PEOPLE

03:09:31.993 --> 03:09:34.362
SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT WE'VE

03:09:34.429 --> 03:09:38.500
MADE SOMETHING BETTER. NOT BEST.

03:09:38.567 --> 03:09:40.402
WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A WORK IN

03:09:40.469 --> 03:09:41.970
PROGRESS. WE DEFINITELY NEED TO

03:09:42.037 --> 03:09:44.473
DO SOME WORK. BUT THIS BILL

03:09:44.539 --> 03:09:47.342
FREEZES ENROLLMENT FOR MEDI-CAL

03:09:47.409 --> 03:09:49.211
FOR UNDOCUMENTED INDIVIDUALS 19

03:09:49.277 --> 03:09:52.481
AND OLDER. BEGINNING IN 2026. IT

03:09:52.547 --> 03:09:54.182
ALLOWS A THREE MONTH GRACE AND

03:09:54.249 --> 03:09:56.051
CURE PERIOD AND STILL CREATES A

03:09:56.118 --> 03:09:58.120
BARRIER TO CARE FOR THE PEOPLE

03:09:58.186 --> 03:09:59.688
THAT SOME PEOPLE JUST DON'T WANT

03:09:59.755 --> 03:10:02.891
TO SEE SERVED. THIS BILL

03:10:02.958 --> 03:10:04.659
REINSTATES THE MEDI-CAL ASSET

03:10:04.726 --> 03:10:08.096
TEST $130,000 FOR SINGLE PERSON,

03:10:08.163 --> 03:10:10.031
WITH $65,000 ADDED FOR EACH

03:10:10.098 --> 03:10:12.167
HOUSEHOLD MEMBER. THERE ARE SOME

03:10:12.234 --> 03:10:14.436
REALLY TOUGH THINGS THAT HAD TO

03:10:14.503 --> 03:10:16.471
HAPPEN. IT ALSO PENALIZES LOW

03:10:16.538 --> 03:10:18.874
INCOME FAMILIES FOR TRYING TO

03:10:18.940 --> 03:10:21.042
SAVE FOR STABILITY. BUT THESE

03:10:21.109 --> 03:10:22.677
ARE THE TOUGH CHOICES THAT WE

03:10:22.744 --> 03:10:24.446
HAVE TO MAKE. SO BEGINNING JULY

03:10:24.513 --> 03:10:26.681
1ST, THE STATE WILL IMPOSE A $30

03:10:26.748 --> 03:10:28.884
OR $30 A MONTH PREMIUM ON

03:10:28.950 --> 03:10:30.318
UNDOCUMENTED MEDI-CAL

03:10:30.385 --> 03:10:32.387
RECIPIENTS. THIS IS A NEW COST

03:10:32.454 --> 03:10:35.257
BURDEN ON FOLKS WHO ARE OFTEN

03:10:35.323 --> 03:10:37.125
CONTRIBUTING TO OUR COMMUNITY

03:10:37.192 --> 03:10:38.527
STRUGGLING TO AFFORD BASICS.

03:10:38.593 --> 03:10:40.328
EVEN WORSE, FULL SCOPE DINNER,

03:10:40.395 --> 03:10:42.430
DENTAL COVERAGE FOR UNDOCUMENTED

03:10:42.497 --> 03:10:44.132
INDIVIDUALS AGED 18 AND OLDER

03:10:44.199 --> 03:10:46.067
WILL BE ELIMINATED THROUGH THIS

03:10:46.134 --> 03:10:47.869
BILL. AND WHILE WE ALL

03:10:47.936 --> 03:10:49.070
UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE IN

03:10:49.137 --> 03:10:51.540
FINANCIAL TROUBLE, WE ARE

03:10:51.606 --> 03:10:53.341
SENDING A MESSAGE THAT WE ARE

03:10:53.408 --> 03:10:54.976
CONSIDERING EVERYONE. WE'RE

03:10:55.043 --> 03:10:56.678
BALANCING THE NEEDS OF EVERYONE

03:10:56.745 --> 03:10:59.080
ACROSS OUR STATE, AND

03:10:59.147 --> 03:11:01.149
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT EVERYONE IS

03:11:01.216 --> 03:11:03.451
BEING HIT, INCLUDING

03:11:03.518 --> 03:11:04.386
UNDOCUMENTED, WHO ARE PAYING

03:11:04.452 --> 03:11:06.154
TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS HERE

03:11:06.221 --> 03:11:08.423
IN OUR COMMUNITY. THIS BILL ALSO

03:11:08.490 --> 03:11:09.524
REPEALS THE COMMUNITY HEALTH

03:11:09.591 --> 03:11:11.026
WORKER CERTIFICATE, WHICH HAS

03:11:11.092 --> 03:11:13.528
BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN HELPING

03:11:13.595 --> 03:11:15.063
NON-ENGLISH PEOPLE. NON-ENGLISH

03:11:15.130 --> 03:11:17.365
SPEAKING CALIFORNIANS, NAVIGATE

03:11:17.432 --> 03:11:19.534
ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE WHEN THEY

03:11:19.601 --> 03:11:21.770
NEED IT. AND SO IF WE ARE REALLY

03:11:21.837 --> 03:11:23.638
LOOKING TO HAVE A HEALTHY,

03:11:23.705 --> 03:11:24.906
SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY, WE NEED

03:11:24.973 --> 03:11:26.875
PEOPLE WHO WORK HERE, PEOPLE WHO

03:11:26.942 --> 03:11:28.643
LIVE HERE, PEOPLE WHO ARE

03:11:28.710 --> 03:11:30.745
NAVIGATING THE DOCUMENT

03:11:30.812 --> 03:11:31.780
DOCUMENTATION PROCESS. WE NEED

03:11:31.847 --> 03:11:33.682
THOSE PEOPLE TO BE HEALTHY,

03:11:33.748 --> 03:11:35.150
ESPECIALLY IF WE WANT THEM TO

03:11:35.217 --> 03:11:36.651
SHOW UP TO THE JOBS THAT THEY

03:11:36.718 --> 03:11:39.020
ARE SHOWING UP TO PAY TAXES TO.

03:11:39.087 --> 03:11:40.388
FINALLY, I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE

03:11:40.455 --> 03:11:41.523
POINT THAT WE ARE CHOOSING TO

03:11:41.590 --> 03:11:44.025
DELAY COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS FOR

03:11:44.092 --> 03:11:45.327
INFERTILITY DIAGNOSIS AND

03:11:45.393 --> 03:11:47.229
FERTILITY TREATMENT, PUSHING THE

03:11:47.295 --> 03:11:49.898
EFFECTIVE DATE FROM 2025 TO

03:11:49.965 --> 03:11:51.566
2026. SO FOR MANY FAMILIES

03:11:51.633 --> 03:11:53.401
HOPING TO GROW, THIS DELAY IS

03:11:53.468 --> 03:11:55.237
MORE THAN BUREAUCRATIC. IT'S

03:11:55.303 --> 03:11:56.571
PERSONAL. SO WE'RE TELLING ALL

03:11:56.638 --> 03:11:59.774
OF OUR CONSTITUENTS WHO AREN'T

03:11:59.841 --> 03:12:01.009
INDEPENDENTLY WEALTHY ENOUGH TO

03:12:01.076 --> 03:12:03.912
AFFORD TREATMENT THAT WE ALL

03:12:03.979 --> 03:12:06.181
HAVE TO GIVE IN THIS PROCESS.

03:12:06.248 --> 03:12:09.885
AND SO THIS BUDGET IS NOT US

03:12:09.951 --> 03:12:12.420
TAKING AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE

03:12:12.487 --> 03:12:14.055
DOCUMENTED AND GIVING TO PEOPLE

03:12:14.122 --> 03:12:16.057
WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED. THIS IS

03:12:16.124 --> 03:12:18.260
FINDING BALANCE AS WE ARE MAKING

03:12:18.326 --> 03:12:19.794
REALLY TOUGH CHOICES. AND I

03:12:19.861 --> 03:12:22.063
THINK IF WE'RE GOING TO TELL THE

03:12:22.130 --> 03:12:24.532
STORY, WE NEED TO TELL THE WHOLE

03:12:24.599 --> 03:12:25.767
STORY. THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER.

03:12:25.834 --> 03:12:27.335
THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

03:12:27.402 --> 03:12:29.504
RANSOM. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAYNES,

03:12:29.571 --> 03:12:35.810
YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I WAS NOT

03:12:35.877 --> 03:12:37.345
PREPARED TO SPEAK TODAY, BUT

03:12:37.412 --> 03:12:39.381
I'VE HEARD A LOT OF CRAZY THINGS

03:12:39.447 --> 03:12:40.916
ON THIS FLOOR. AND LET ME

03:12:40.982 --> 03:12:41.883
REITERATE ONE THING THAT

03:12:41.950 --> 03:12:44.185
EVERYONE KEEPS FORGETTING. HI,

03:12:44.252 --> 03:12:47.422
I'M A DOCTOR. I SEE MEDICAID

03:12:47.489 --> 03:12:48.823
PATIENTS. I WAS THERE ON SUNDAY

03:12:48.890 --> 03:12:50.525
ACTUALLY PROVIDING HEALTH CARE.

03:12:50.592 --> 03:12:52.661
SO A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO TALK

03:12:52.727 --> 03:12:55.297
ABOUT HEALTH CARE SAVING HEALTH

03:12:55.363 --> 03:12:56.932
CARE. EVERYBODY HAS AN OPINION

03:12:56.998 --> 03:12:59.467
ON HOW TO SAVE HEALTH CARE. HOW

03:12:59.534 --> 03:13:01.670
ABOUT YOU SPEND A DAY WITH ME IN

03:13:01.736 --> 03:13:03.271
MY CLINIC? OPEN INVITATION.

03:13:03.338 --> 03:13:04.973
BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF

03:13:05.040 --> 03:13:06.474
OPINIONS ON THIS FLOOR ON HOW

03:13:06.541 --> 03:13:08.243
WE'RE GOING TO SAVE HEALTH CARE

03:13:08.310 --> 03:13:09.577
WHEN YOU HAVE ZERO EXPERIENCE.

03:13:09.644 --> 03:13:10.779
AND I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE NOT

03:13:10.845 --> 03:13:12.414
GOING TO BECOME A PHYSICIAN

03:13:12.480 --> 03:13:13.682
OVERNIGHT BECAUSE IT TAKES 11

03:13:13.748 --> 03:13:16.985
YEARS. THIS IS MY ENTIRE CAREER.

03:13:17.052 --> 03:13:18.320
I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT,

03:13:18.386 --> 03:13:20.388
AND I AM SICK AND TIRED AS A

03:13:20.455 --> 03:13:22.857
WOMAN BEING TOLD, YOU DON'T KNOW

03:13:22.924 --> 03:13:24.793
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. GUESS

03:13:24.859 --> 03:13:27.362
WHAT? I SPENT 11 YEARS OF MY

03:13:27.429 --> 03:13:29.898
LIFE STUDYING TO BECOME A

03:13:29.965 --> 03:13:31.666
DOCTOR. I AM SPENDING MY

03:13:31.733 --> 03:13:34.836
WEEKENDS PROVIDING HEALTH CARE.

03:13:34.903 --> 03:13:37.839
ONE THING THAT IS NOT GOING TO

03:13:37.906 --> 03:13:39.908
CHANGE, AND PEOPLE NEED TO

03:13:39.975 --> 03:13:42.377
UNDERSTAND PROVIDING EARLY

03:13:42.444 --> 03:13:46.047
PREVENTATIVE SERVICES DECREASES

03:13:46.114 --> 03:13:49.985
HEALTHCARE COSTS ALL AROUND,

03:13:50.051 --> 03:13:52.220
MAKING SURE PEOPLE CAN GET INTO

03:13:52.287 --> 03:13:55.824
A CLINIC AND GETTING THINGS LIKE

03:13:55.890 --> 03:13:57.625
ACCESS TO VALLEY FEVER TREATMENT

03:13:57.692 --> 03:13:59.361
INSTEAD OF THEM SHOWING UP TO

03:13:59.427 --> 03:14:00.395
THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND COSTING

03:14:00.462 --> 03:14:04.032
$1 MILLION IN AN ICU STAY.

03:14:04.099 --> 03:14:05.767
THAT'S CALLED HUMAN DECENCY,

03:14:05.834 --> 03:14:07.235
GUYS. AND GUESS WHAT? IT TURNS

03:14:07.302 --> 03:14:09.404
OUT IT ACTUALLY DECREASES HEALTH

03:14:09.471 --> 03:14:12.607
CARE COSTS. SO YES, YOU WANT TO

03:14:12.674 --> 03:14:15.510
TALK ABOUT THE SOLVENCY OF

03:14:15.577 --> 03:14:17.312
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. HOW ABOUT WE

03:14:17.379 --> 03:14:19.247
STOP TELLING THE DOCTOR IN THE

03:14:19.314 --> 03:14:21.282
ROOM TO SHUT UP AND LISTEN TO

03:14:21.349 --> 03:14:24.519
HER, AND MAYBE SPEND A DAY WITH

03:14:24.586 --> 03:14:26.955
HER ON SUNDAY AS SHE PROVIDES

03:14:27.022 --> 03:14:29.224
HEALTH CARE IN HER HOMETOWN OF

03:14:29.290 --> 03:14:31.826
DELANO, ACROSS THE STREET FROM

03:14:31.893 --> 03:14:34.529
WHERE SHE WENT TO PRESCHOOL,

03:14:34.596 --> 03:14:35.964
ACROSS THE STREET FROM WHERE SHE

03:14:36.031 --> 03:14:37.799
FIRST LEARNED TO READ AT THE

03:14:37.866 --> 03:14:40.735
LIBRARY ACROSS THE STREET FROM

03:14:40.802 --> 03:14:42.537
WHERE THESE RIDICULOUS

03:14:42.604 --> 03:14:45.740
IMMIGRATION RAIDS STARTED IN

03:14:45.807 --> 03:14:49.611
CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU, ASSEMBLY

03:14:49.677 --> 03:14:52.213
MEMBER. BAINES, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

03:14:52.280 --> 03:14:55.784
TANGPA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK

03:14:55.850 --> 03:14:57.218
YOU, MR. SPEAKER. AND I TOO,

03:14:57.285 --> 03:15:01.556
RISE TO LIVE IN REALITY. A

03:15:01.623 --> 03:15:03.358
QUESTION THAT I WAS ABLE TO ASK

03:15:03.425 --> 03:15:04.859
MEMBERS WHO ANALYZED THE BUDGET,

03:15:04.926 --> 03:15:06.561
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE, THE

03:15:06.628 --> 03:15:10.465
LAO ONE QUESTION COULD WE EVEN

03:15:10.532 --> 03:15:14.202
VOTE ON THIS BUDGET IN THREE

03:15:14.269 --> 03:15:17.005
YEARS WITH OUR CURRENT RESERVES?

03:15:17.072 --> 03:15:20.842
AND THE ANSWER IS NO, NOT WITH

03:15:20.909 --> 03:15:22.877
THE EXPECTED PROJECTIONS, NOT

03:15:22.944 --> 03:15:24.612
WITH THE COST OF SPENDING, AND

03:15:24.679 --> 03:15:26.047
NOT WITH THE CURRENT TRAJECTORY

03:15:26.114 --> 03:15:28.883
THAT WE ARE ON RIGHT NOW. SO

03:15:28.950 --> 03:15:30.718
OUTSIDE OF THE ARGUMENTS OF

03:15:30.785 --> 03:15:32.353
ALTRUISM AND COMPASSION AND

03:15:32.420 --> 03:15:35.423
WHETHER WE LOVE OUR MAMA OR NOT,

03:15:35.490 --> 03:15:38.259
I LIVE IN REALITY AND HOSPITALS

03:15:38.326 --> 03:15:41.463
ARE SHUTTING DOWN IN MY DISTRICT

03:15:41.529 --> 03:15:44.365
LEFT AND RIGHT, BECAUSE WE HAVE

03:15:44.432 --> 03:15:47.335
NOT FIXED THE REIMBURSEMENT

03:15:47.402 --> 03:15:49.504
RATES BEFORE WE EXPAND THEM TO

03:15:49.571 --> 03:15:51.606
MORE AND TO OTHER PEOPLE. WE

03:15:51.673 --> 03:15:53.408
TALK ABOUT LABOR AND DELIVERY.

03:15:53.475 --> 03:15:55.176
THERE'S NOT A SINGLE PLACE IN

03:15:55.243 --> 03:15:58.346
THE COUNTY OF MADERA THAT

03:15:58.413 --> 03:16:00.248
APPLIES LABOR AND DELIVERY. YOU

03:16:00.315 --> 03:16:03.885
CAN'T HAVE A BABY THERE, AND ITS

03:16:03.952 --> 03:16:06.421
INFLOWING INTO FRESNO COUNTY AND

03:16:06.488 --> 03:16:08.456
PUTTING OTHER HOSPITALS AT RISK.

03:16:08.523 --> 03:16:10.992
AND IT IS A SNOWBALL EFFECT THAT

03:16:11.059 --> 03:16:13.495
WE WILL ALL HAVE TO REALIZE

03:16:13.561 --> 03:16:16.764
SOONER OR LATER TO LIVE IN

03:16:16.831 --> 03:16:18.967
REALITY, THAT THE SYSTEM IS

03:16:19.033 --> 03:16:21.035
COLLAPSING BECAUSE OUR

03:16:21.102 --> 03:16:23.304
RESPONSIBILITY IS TO MAKE SURE

03:16:23.371 --> 03:16:25.540
THAT WE CAN BALANCE THE BUDGET,

03:16:25.607 --> 03:16:26.808
THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THE SERVICES

03:16:26.875 --> 03:16:29.377
AVAILABLE FOR ALL PRIOR TO

03:16:29.444 --> 03:16:31.146
EXPANDING, BECAUSE MORE AND MORE

03:16:31.212 --> 03:16:33.615
HOSPITALS ARE COLLAPSING. I

03:16:33.681 --> 03:16:35.316
THINK ABOUT FIXING THE

03:16:35.383 --> 03:16:36.151
ENFORCEMENT, THE REIMBURSEMENT

03:16:36.217 --> 03:16:38.586
RATES FIRST, BECAUSE AIR MEDICAL

03:16:38.653 --> 03:16:41.623
IS SO VITALLY IMPORTANT TO MY

03:16:41.689 --> 03:16:44.893
DISTRICT, AND YET WE'RE NOT

03:16:44.959 --> 03:16:46.261
FIXING THEIR REIMBURSEMENT

03:16:46.327 --> 03:16:48.563
RATES, WHICH WILL LEAD TO A

03:16:48.630 --> 03:16:50.598
CONSOLIDATION AND CLOSURES OF

03:16:50.665 --> 03:16:54.235
MORE, WHICH IS LIFE SAVING

03:16:54.302 --> 03:16:55.470
TRANSPORTATION THAT HAPPENS IN

03:16:55.537 --> 03:16:58.173
THE RURAL COUNTIES IN AREAS OF

03:16:58.239 --> 03:16:59.240
CALIFORNIA. WE HAVEN'T FIXED

03:16:59.307 --> 03:17:03.578
THAT YET. IT'S COLLAPSING. THE

03:17:07.115 --> 03:17:09.651
WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT,

03:17:09.717 --> 03:17:15.156
WHETHER WE FEEL ONE WAY OR NOT.

03:17:15.223 --> 03:17:18.059
IT'S NUMBERS. IT'S DATA. YOU CAN

03:17:18.126 --> 03:17:20.128
ARGUE WITH THAT, BUT WE CANNOT

03:17:20.195 --> 03:17:22.297
KEEP GOING DOWN THIS PATH. AND

03:17:22.363 --> 03:17:24.666
AGAIN, UNTIL WE FIX THE PROBLEMS

03:17:24.732 --> 03:17:26.301
IN FRONT OF US, UNTIL WE MAKE

03:17:26.367 --> 03:17:29.070
SURE THAT THE RATES LEAVE,

03:17:29.137 --> 03:17:32.006
HOSPITALS THAT DON'T SHUT DOWN.

03:17:32.073 --> 03:17:33.908

03:36:18.398 --> 03:36:21.368
EMERGENCY SERVICES. NONE. COPPER

03:36:21.435 --> 03:36:22.703
LANDLINE PHONES HAVE SERVED THE

03:36:22.769 --> 03:36:24.838
PUBLIC FOR GENERATIONS, BUT NO

03:36:24.905 --> 03:36:26.740
LONGER MEET THE MODERN

03:36:26.807 --> 03:36:28.475
TELECOMMUNICATIONS NEEDS. OF THE

03:36:28.542 --> 03:36:30.510
40 MILLION PEOPLE THAT CALL

03:36:30.577 --> 03:36:32.846
CALIFORNIA HOME, JUST AS

03:36:32.913 --> 03:36:34.214
TELECOMMUNICATION NEEDS ARE

03:36:34.281 --> 03:36:36.750
EVOLVING, IT IS TIME FOR OUR

03:36:36.817 --> 03:36:38.018
TELECOMMUNICATION LAWS TO

03:36:38.085 --> 03:36:40.220
EVOLVE. AB 47 CREATES A

03:36:40.287 --> 03:36:42.456
FRAMEWORK TO FACILITATE THE

03:36:42.522 --> 03:36:44.725
LARGEST PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN

03:36:44.791 --> 03:36:46.526
ADVANCED FIBER OPTIC NETWORKS IN

03:36:46.593 --> 03:36:48.562
THE STATE HISTORY, AND TO ENSURE

03:36:48.628 --> 03:36:50.597
THAT ALL CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS

03:36:50.664 --> 03:36:52.933
WILL CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE

03:36:52.999 --> 03:36:55.035
AFFORDABLE, RELIABLE TELEPHONE

03:36:55.102 --> 03:36:57.304
CALLS AND CONNECT WITH EMERGENCY

03:36:57.371 --> 03:36:59.106
SERVICES WHEN THEY NEED IT.

03:36:59.172 --> 03:37:00.741
MEMBERS. CUSTOMER DEMAND IS

03:37:00.807 --> 03:37:03.043
DRIVING THIS TECHNOLOGY

03:37:03.110 --> 03:37:05.145
EVOLUTION, WITH LESS THAN 5% OF

03:37:05.212 --> 03:37:06.947
CALIFORNIANS STILL USING COPPER

03:37:07.013 --> 03:37:08.749
LINES AND MOST RESIDENTS USING

03:37:08.815 --> 03:37:10.884
EITHER A WIRELESS PHONE SERVICE

03:37:10.951 --> 03:37:13.854
OR A FIBER BASED VOIP PHONE

03:37:13.920 --> 03:37:15.555
SERVICE FOR TELECOMMUNICATION

03:37:15.622 --> 03:37:18.525
NEEDS, THAT MEANS 5% OF

03:37:18.592 --> 03:37:20.260
CALIFORNIANS DO NOT HAVE A HOME

03:37:20.327 --> 03:37:23.230
PHONE. MEMBERS AB 470 WILL

03:37:23.296 --> 03:37:25.031
CHANGE TELECOMMUNICATION IN

03:37:25.098 --> 03:37:26.867
CALIFORNIA AND IT WILL CHANGE IT

03:37:26.933 --> 03:37:28.402
FOR THE BETTER. A MORE

03:37:28.468 --> 03:37:30.303

03:37:30.370 --> 03:37:32.572
ECONOMIC ECONOMY IS NEEDED NOW

03:37:32.639 --> 03:37:34.641
MORE THAN EVER IN CALIFORNIA.

03:37:34.708 --> 03:37:37.210
LET US NOT BE LIMITED BY OUR

03:37:37.277 --> 03:37:38.578
RELIANCE ON OBSOLETE

03:37:38.645 --> 03:37:40.514
TECHNOLOGIES OF THE PAST. LET US

03:37:40.580 --> 03:37:42.749
LOOK TO THE FUTURE AND BUILD A

03:37:42.816 --> 03:37:44.551
FUTURE THAT WILL KEEP ALL

03:37:44.618 --> 03:37:46.086
CALIFORNIANS CONNECTED. I WANT

03:37:46.153 --> 03:37:48.321
TO THANK THE SPEAKER FOR LEADING

03:37:48.388 --> 03:37:50.157
NEGOTIATIONS THAT LED TO RURAL

03:37:50.223 --> 03:37:53.026

URBAN COUNTY CAUCUS TO ALL

03:37:59.666 --> 03:38:02.068
REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION. I HAVE

03:38:02.135 --> 03:38:04.838
ALSO I'VE ALSO HAD PRODUCTIVE

03:38:04.905 --> 03:38:06.673
CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR LABOR

03:38:06.740 --> 03:38:08.141
PARTNERS AND LOOK FORWARD TO

03:38:08.208 --> 03:38:09.609
CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS WITH

03:38:09.676 --> 03:38:11.678
LABOR, LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE

03:38:11.745 --> 03:38:13.580
BUSINESS COMMUNITIES TO BUILD ON

03:38:13.647 --> 03:38:16.082
THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. I AM

03:38:16.149 --> 03:38:18.652
COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT

03:38:18.718 --> 03:38:20.420
LABOR WILL DO THE WORK ON THE

03:38:20.487 --> 03:38:23.790
BUILD OUT OF FIBER IN THE

03:38:23.857 --> 03:38:25.525
UNDERSERVED AND ECONOMICALLY

03:38:25.592 --> 03:38:26.560
DISADVANTAGED AREAS OF THE STATE

03:38:26.626 --> 03:38:29.396
OF CALIFORNIA. AND WITH THAT, I

03:38:29.463 --> 03:38:30.730
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE

03:38:30.797 --> 03:38:34.468
ON AB 470 AND REQUEST IMMEDIATE

03:38:34.534 --> 03:38:36.002
TRANSMITTAL TO THE STATE SENATE.

03:38:36.069 --> 03:38:38.171
THANK YOU. THANK YOU, ASSEMBLY

03:38:38.238 --> 03:38:39.973
MEMBER ASSEMBLYMEMBER BERNER,

03:38:40.040 --> 03:38:42.075
YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. GOOD

03:38:42.142 --> 03:38:43.210
MORNING, MR. SPEAKER. AND

03:38:43.276 --> 03:38:44.711
MEMBERS, TODAY I RISE IN SUPPORT

03:38:44.778 --> 03:38:46.346
OF AS CHAIR OF COMMUNICATIONS

03:38:46.413 --> 03:38:47.814
AND CONVEYANCE. I WANTED TO

03:38:47.881 --> 03:38:49.349
REMIND MEMBERS ABOUT THE AMOUNT

03:38:49.416 --> 03:38:52.185
OF WORK THAT WENT INTO THIS BILL

03:38:52.252 --> 03:38:53.887
TO STRIKE A BALANCE AND MOVE THE

03:38:53.954 --> 03:38:56.022
POLICY FORWARD. WHEN THIS BILL

03:38:56.089 --> 03:38:57.924
PASSED OUT OF C AND C, THE FIRST

03:38:57.991 --> 03:38:58.892
GO AROUND, I BELIEVE OUR

03:38:58.959 --> 03:39:00.494
COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS PUT THIS

03:39:00.560 --> 03:39:02.596
BILL ON THE RIGHT TRACK. WE

03:39:02.662 --> 03:39:05.432
REQUIRED PROCESS, WE INCLUDED

03:39:05.499 --> 03:39:06.566
GUIDELINES, AND WE ENSURED THAT

03:39:06.633 --> 03:39:07.901
THERE WOULD BE A COMMITMENT TO

03:39:07.968 --> 03:39:10.036
PUBLIC BENEFITS AS PART OF THE

03:39:10.103 --> 03:39:11.505
PROCESS. SINCE THEN, THE AUTHOR,

03:39:11.571 --> 03:39:12.806
THE SPEAKER STAFF AND THE

03:39:12.873 --> 03:39:14.341
COMMITTEE STAFF HAVE ONLY

03:39:14.407 --> 03:39:15.976
CONTINUED TO WORK WITH THE

03:39:16.042 --> 03:39:17.677
OPPOSITION TO MAKE THIS AN EVEN

03:39:17.744 --> 03:39:19.045
BETTER BILL. WHILE I UNDERSTAND

03:39:19.112 --> 03:39:20.480
THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT

03:39:20.547 --> 03:39:21.348
CALIFORNIANS GETTING LEFT BEHIND

03:39:21.414 --> 03:39:22.682
IN THIS TRANSITION, I BELIEVE WE

03:39:22.749 --> 03:39:25.485
HAVE STRONG GUARDRAILS IN PLACE

03:39:25.552 --> 03:39:26.620
TO ENSURE THAT THIS DOES NOT

03:39:26.686 --> 03:39:29.422
HAPPEN. AND ALSO PROCEDURES

03:39:29.489 --> 03:39:31.424
SHOULD IT HAPPEN. CALIFORNIANS

03:39:31.491 --> 03:39:33.059
WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE ACCESS TO

03:39:33.126 --> 03:39:34.160
MULTIPLE OPTIONS UNDER THIS

03:39:34.227 --> 03:39:36.029
BILL. SOME TELECOMMUNICATION

03:39:36.096 --> 03:39:37.397
TELEPHONE CORPORATIONS MAY GET

03:39:37.464 --> 03:39:39.232
RELIEF OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS AND

03:39:39.299 --> 03:39:42.035
THE PUBLIC WILL BENEFIT MOVING

03:39:42.102 --> 03:39:43.603
FORWARD. I KNOW THE AUTHOR IS

03:39:43.670 --> 03:39:44.571
COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH OUR

03:39:44.638 --> 03:39:46.840
FRIENDS IN THE LABOR MOVEMENT. I

03:39:46.907 --> 03:39:48.208
KNOW THAT THEY REMAIN OPPOSED

03:39:48.275 --> 03:39:49.509
RIGHT NOW, BUT I'M ENCOURAGED

03:39:49.576 --> 03:39:51.278
THAT THEY ARE NOW COMING TO THE

03:39:51.344 --> 03:39:53.013
TABLE WITH SUGGESTIONS THAT I

03:39:53.079 --> 03:39:55.515
BELIEVE ONLY MAKE THIS BILL MORE

03:39:55.582 --> 03:39:58.051
ROBUST IN ENSURING A JUST

03:39:58.118 --> 03:39:59.319
TRANSITION. WHAT I HAVE SAID

03:39:59.386 --> 03:40:00.820
BEFORE IS THIS TRANSITION AWAY

03:40:00.887 --> 03:40:03.156
FROM COPPER NETWORKS TO ADVANCE

03:40:03.223 --> 03:40:03.857
TELECOMMUNICATIONS

03:40:03.924 --> 03:40:05.592
INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT HAPPENING,

03:40:05.659 --> 03:40:08.094
IS NOT HAPPENING BECAUSE OF THIS

03:40:08.161 --> 03:40:10.597
BILL. IT IS HAPPENING DESPITE

03:40:10.664 --> 03:40:12.666
THIS BILL. HOWEVER, IF WE WANT

03:40:12.732 --> 03:40:14.801
TO ENSURE THE PUBLIC AND WORKERS

03:40:14.868 --> 03:40:15.869
BENEFIT, I CONTINUE TO BELIEVE

03:40:15.936 --> 03:40:18.338
THAT LEGISLATION IS NECESSARY TO

03:40:18.405 --> 03:40:20.740
ENSURE THAT WE REACH THIS GOAL.

03:40:20.807 --> 03:40:23.577
THIS BILL CAN BE A WIN WIN FOR

03:40:23.643 --> 03:40:24.811
ALL PARTIES, AND I'M CONFIDENT

03:40:24.878 --> 03:40:26.046
THERE IS A PATH FORWARD TOWARDS

03:40:26.112 --> 03:40:27.380
THAT END. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY

03:40:27.447 --> 03:40:29.316
MORE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE

03:40:29.382 --> 03:40:31.718
IN THE SENATE, BUT I'M

03:40:31.785 --> 03:40:32.352
CONFIDENT, BASED ON WHERE THIS

03:40:32.419 --> 03:40:34.054
BILL IS TODAY, THAT IT IS WORTH

03:40:34.120 --> 03:40:35.589
MOVING FORWARD AND THIS BILL AND

03:40:35.655 --> 03:40:36.590
THE WORK WILL CONTINUE. THIS IS

03:40:36.656 --> 03:40:38.191
JUST THE FIRST HOUSE, AND WE

03:40:38.258 --> 03:40:39.593
WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

03:40:39.659 --> 03:40:40.894
REVIEW THE POLICY. ON

03:40:40.961 --> 03:40:43.396
CONCURRENCE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK

03:40:43.463 --> 03:40:46.633
FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU.

03:40:46.700 --> 03:40:48.668
ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERNER. ASSEMBLY

03:40:48.735 --> 03:40:50.170

03:40:50.236 --> 03:40:51.605
RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU SO MUCH,

03:40:51.671 --> 03:40:53.807
MR. SPEAKER. WHEN THIS BILL

03:40:53.873 --> 03:40:55.141
FIRST CAME TO THE COMMUNICATIONS

03:40:55.208 --> 03:40:56.710
AND CONVEYANCE COMMITTEE, I WAS

03:40:56.776 --> 03:40:59.279
ONE OF THE MEMBERS WHO COULDN'T

03:40:59.346 --> 03:41:00.580
SUPPORT IT. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

03:41:00.647 --> 03:41:02.449
THE DIVIDE BETWEEN URBAN AND

03:41:02.515 --> 03:41:04.351
RURAL AREAS AND THE WAY THAT

03:41:04.417 --> 03:41:06.119
THAT PLAYS INTO TELECOM, WE'RE

03:41:06.186 --> 03:41:07.454
OFTENTIMES TALKING ABOUT MY

03:41:07.520 --> 03:41:08.822
DISTRICT GOING FROM SONOMA

03:41:08.888 --> 03:41:10.190
COUNTY ALL THE WAY UP TO OREGON.

03:41:10.256 --> 03:41:13.259
WE TALKED EXTENSIVELY ABOUT THE

03:41:13.326 --> 03:41:14.961
IMPORTANCE OF CARRIER, OF LAST

03:41:15.028 --> 03:41:16.796
RESORT, AND HOW THAT WAS MORE OR

03:41:16.863 --> 03:41:19.633
LESS A PROXY FOR LACK OF

03:41:19.699 --> 03:41:21.334
INVESTMENT IN THE AREA AND LACK

03:41:21.401 --> 03:41:23.970
OF KEEPING PROMISES THAT HAD

03:41:24.037 --> 03:41:25.705
BEEN MADE TO AREAS FOR BROADBAND

03:41:25.772 --> 03:41:28.408
SERVICE. AND I WASN'T ABLE TO

03:41:28.475 --> 03:41:31.444
SUPPORT. BUT I WILL SAY MY

03:41:31.511 --> 03:41:33.380
COLLEAGUE FROM INGLEWOOD NOT

03:41:33.446 --> 03:41:35.515
ONLY TOOK THE TIME TO MEET WITH

03:41:35.582 --> 03:41:38.485
MY SUPERVISORS AND TO TALK TO

03:41:38.551 --> 03:41:40.487
FOLKS FROM RURAL AREAS, TO ASK

03:41:40.553 --> 03:41:42.322
THEM, NOT JUST ABOUT HOW HER

03:41:42.389 --> 03:41:43.923
BILL AS CRAFTED WOULD IMPACT

03:41:43.990 --> 03:41:46.026
THEM, BUT WHAT THEY NEED MOVING

03:41:46.092 --> 03:41:47.460
FORWARD TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT

03:41:47.527 --> 03:41:48.995
INVESTMENT IN THEIR COMMUNITY.

03:41:49.062 --> 03:41:50.463
SHE REALLY LISTENED, AND I WANT

03:41:50.530 --> 03:41:51.765
TO THANK HER FOR THE AMENDMENTS

03:41:51.831 --> 03:41:53.299
THAT SHE TOOK. THAT'S PART OF

03:41:53.366 --> 03:41:55.935
THE REASON, I THINK, THAT OUR

03:41:56.002 --> 03:41:57.504
CRC END UP GOING NEUTRAL WAS

03:41:57.570 --> 03:41:58.271
THAT FOCUS AND THAT ATTENTION ON

03:41:58.338 --> 03:41:59.439
DELIVERING FOR FOLKS. I KNOW

03:41:59.506 --> 03:42:01.508
THAT SHE'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO

03:42:01.574 --> 03:42:03.576
WORK WITH OUR LABOR PARTNERS WHO

03:42:03.643 --> 03:42:04.344
CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS. SO

03:42:04.411 --> 03:42:05.712
WHEN IT CAME BACK TO OUR

03:42:05.779 --> 03:42:06.613
COMMITTEE EARLIER THIS WEEK, I

03:42:06.680 --> 03:42:09.149
WAS ABLE TO SUPPORT IT, BRING IT

03:42:09.215 --> 03:42:10.116
TO THIS FLOOR, AND I'LL BE

03:42:10.183 --> 03:42:11.351

03:42:11.418 --> 03:42:13.453

03:42:15.188 --> 03:42:15.789
DILIGENCE ON THIS, TO MAKE SURE

03:42:15.855 --> 03:42:17.624
THAT RURAL VOICES WERE NOT

03:42:17.691 --> 03:42:18.491
SIDELINED AGAIN, BUT RATHER TOOK

03:42:18.558 --> 03:42:19.826
THEM INTO ACCOUNT AND ACTUALLY

03:42:19.893 --> 03:42:21.294
PRODUCED SOMETHING THAT SHOULD

03:42:21.361 --> 03:42:22.529
HELP THEM MOVING FORWARD. THANK

WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE MEMBER
