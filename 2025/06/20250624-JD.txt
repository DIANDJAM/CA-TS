SUBCOMMITTEE AND START WITH

00:35:44.842 --> 00:35:47.512
SENATOR UMBERG, WHO HAS SEVERAL

00:35:47.578 --> 00:35:49.447
BILLS BEFORE US. I BELIEVE,

00:35:49.514 --> 00:35:50.515
SENATOR, YOU'RE GOING TO BE

00:35:50.581 --> 00:35:53.084
STARTING WITH ITEM THREE, SB

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:54.852
253, IS THAT CORRECT? THAT'S

00:35:54.919 --> 00:36:01.959
CORRECT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU,

00:36:02.026 --> 00:36:04.495
MR. CHAIR. AND MEMBERS. I HAVE

00:36:04.562 --> 00:36:07.164
BEFORE YOU SB 253, WHICH IS THE

00:36:07.231 --> 00:36:10.101
ANNUAL STATE BAR FEE BILL. WE

00:36:10.167 --> 00:36:12.169
ARE NOT INCREASING FEES THIS

00:36:12.236 --> 00:36:13.471
YEAR, BUT WE ARE CHANGING THE

00:36:13.538 --> 00:36:15.373
LAW A BIT WITH RESPECT TO THE

00:36:15.439 --> 00:36:18.409
STATE BAR, AS I THINK YOU KNOW,

00:36:18.476 --> 00:36:19.443
STATE BAR HAS HAD SOME

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:20.778
CHALLENGES. THEY'VE HAD SOME

00:36:20.845 --> 00:36:22.146
CHALLENGES WITH RESPECT TO THE

00:36:22.213 --> 00:36:23.514
DISCIPLINE SYSTEM THAT YOU AND I

00:36:23.581 --> 00:36:25.182
HAVE WORKED ON FOR THE LAST FEW

00:36:25.249 --> 00:36:27.685
YEARS, MR. CHAIR. AND THIS PAST

00:36:27.752 --> 00:36:30.254
FEBRUARY, THERE WAS A COMPLETE

00:36:30.321 --> 00:36:31.622
MELTDOWN IN TERMS OF THE

00:36:31.689 --> 00:36:32.623
ADMINISTRATION OF THE STATE'S

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:36.193
BAR EXAM. IN THAT VEIN, THIS

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:39.130
BILL ALSO PROVIDES, IN ADDITION

00:36:39.196 --> 00:36:41.999
TO A FEE, WHICH IS THE SAME AS

00:36:42.066 --> 00:36:43.734
LAST YEAR, IT PROVIDES THAT

00:36:43.801 --> 00:36:45.503
CHANGING OF VENDOR OF THE

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:46.637
MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS

00:36:46.704 --> 00:36:48.539
CONSTITUTES A SUBSTANTIAL

00:36:48.606 --> 00:36:49.640
MODIFICATION. THE BAR EXAM AND

00:36:49.707 --> 00:36:51.776
ANY SUCH CHANGE REQUIRES TWO

00:36:51.842 --> 00:36:53.778
YEAR NOTICE TO THE PUBLIC. AND

00:36:53.844 --> 00:36:55.513
IT ALSO SAYS THAT WE'RE GOING TO

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.915
GO BACK TO THE OLD SCHOOL METHOD

00:36:57.982 --> 00:36:59.750
OF DELIVERING THE STATE BAR

00:36:59.817 --> 00:37:01.352
EXAM, PARTICULARLY FOR THE BAR

00:37:01.419 --> 00:37:04.288
EXAM THAT'S COMING UP NEXT, NEXT

00:37:04.355 --> 00:37:06.123
MONTH. THESE CHANGES ARE

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:07.558
INTENDED TO PROVIDE SOME

00:37:07.625 --> 00:37:09.327
STABILITY AND SOME CLARITY,

00:37:09.393 --> 00:37:11.862
PARTICULARLY FOR APPLICANTS.

00:37:11.929 --> 00:37:14.999
SADLY, THERE WERE A NUMBER OF

00:37:15.066 --> 00:37:17.568
INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE VICTIMIZED

00:37:17.635 --> 00:37:19.870
AND REMEDIES ARE VERY, VERY

00:37:19.937 --> 00:37:21.539
LIMITED AS TO WHAT WE CAN DO FOR

00:37:21.606 --> 00:37:22.740
THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED.

00:37:22.807 --> 00:37:25.276
MY HEART IS AS A MEMBER OF THE

00:37:25.343 --> 00:37:27.845
PROFESSION, MY HEART GOES OUT TO

00:37:27.912 --> 00:37:29.480
THEM AND I KNOW THE BAR HAS

00:37:29.547 --> 00:37:32.083
TAKEN SOME STEPS TO AMELIORATE

00:37:32.149 --> 00:37:35.219
OR MITIGATE, BUT THERE ARE ONLY

00:37:35.286 --> 00:37:36.687
CERTAIN THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE.

00:37:36.754 --> 00:37:39.256
AND WITH THAT, MR. CHAIR, I URGE

00:37:39.323 --> 00:37:41.659
AND I VOTE. THANK YOU. IS THERE

00:37:41.726 --> 00:37:42.860
ANYONE ELSE HERE IN SUPPORT OF

00:37:42.927 --> 00:37:54.038
SB 253?

00:37:54.105 --> 00:37:58.342
NO. OKAY. EVERYONE'S AFRAID.

00:37:58.409 --> 00:38:01.045
YEAH. IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN

00:38:01.112 --> 00:38:06.217

BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE. ANY

00:38:08.019 --> 00:38:10.221

FEDERAL ANTITRUST LAW UNDER THE

HART-SCOTT-RODINO ACT REQUIRES

00:40:08.439 --> 00:40:10.107

TO THESE NOTICES, ANTITRUST

00:40:24.655 --> 00:40:26.023
AGENCIES ARE BETTER ABLE TO

DURING THE MERGER REVIEW PROCESS

00:40:29.193 --> 00:40:30.561
BY ALLOWING THE AGENCIES TO

ACCESS TO THESE NOTICES BECAUSE

00:40:39.003 --> 00:40:40.304
OF THE CONFIDENTIALITY

REQUIREMENT OF

00:40:41.806 --> 00:40:43.073

UPFRONT RATHER THAN LATER ON.

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:13.070
THIS ACTUALLY, IF THE MERGER IS

00:41:13.137 --> 00:41:14.572
APPROPRIATE, EXPEDITES THE

00:41:14.638 --> 00:41:15.706

00:41:26.884 --> 00:41:28.519
GOOD MORNING. SO I'M DAN

00:41:28.586 --> 00:41:29.987
ROBBINS, I'M A COMMISSIONER ON

00:41:30.054 --> 00:41:31.889
THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION FOR

00:41:31.956 --> 00:41:34.458
UNIFORM STATE LAWS AND ALSO THE

00:41:34.525 --> 00:41:36.493
IMMEDIATE PAST PRESIDENT OF THE

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.429
NATIONAL UNIFORM LAW COMMISSION.

00:41:38.495 --> 00:41:39.697
WE'VE WE BROUGHT YOU BILLS IN

00:41:39.763 --> 00:41:42.233
THE PAST, THE UNIFORM COMMERCIAL

00:41:42.299 --> 00:41:44.401
CODE, UNIFORM TRADE SECRETS ACT,

00:41:44.468 --> 00:41:47.037
AND MANY OTHER SUCCESSFUL BILLS.

00:41:47.104 --> 00:41:48.672
AS THE SENATOR EXPLAINED, YOU

00:41:48.739 --> 00:41:51.542
KNOW, TODAY, THE STATE AND THE

00:41:51.609 --> 00:41:53.811
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE EQUAL

00:41:53.878 --> 00:41:55.946
FOOTING TO ENFORCE OUR FEDERAL

00:41:56.013 --> 00:41:57.848
MERGER LAW, THE CLAYTON ACT. BUT

00:41:57.915 --> 00:42:00.384
THE STATE DOESN'T GET THE

00:42:00.451 --> 00:42:01.285
HART-SCOTT-RODINO FILINGS THE

00:42:01.352 --> 00:42:03.454
SENATOR MENTIONED. SO WE'RE AT A

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:05.656
SIGNIFICANT DISADVANTAGE TO

00:42:05.723 --> 00:42:08.759
PROTECTING OUR CITIZENS. WE

00:42:08.826 --> 00:42:09.927
DON'T GET THE NOTICES, SO WE

00:42:09.994 --> 00:42:11.729
MIGHT FIND OUT ABOUT THESE

00:42:11.795 --> 00:42:13.998
TRANSACTIONS MONTHS LATE. A LONG

00:42:14.064 --> 00:42:15.699
TIME AGO, I WAS AT THE AG'S

00:42:15.766 --> 00:42:17.601
OFFICE WHERE WE FOUND OUT ABOUT

00:42:17.668 --> 00:42:19.470
A MERGER BETWEEN THE NUMBER ONE

00:42:19.536 --> 00:42:21.772
AND NUMBER FOUR SUPERMARKETS OF

00:42:21.839 --> 00:42:23.941
OUR STATE. YOU MIGHT REMEMBER

00:42:24.008 --> 00:42:25.709
LUCKY AND ALPHA-BETA, THE

00:42:25.776 --> 00:42:27.278
FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION MADE A

00:42:27.344 --> 00:42:29.046
DEAL THAT WE WEREN'T PART OF, SO

00:42:29.113 --> 00:42:31.215
WE HAD TO COMMENCE A LAWSUIT,

00:42:31.282 --> 00:42:32.516
WENT TO THE SUPREME COURT. WE

00:42:32.583 --> 00:42:34.418
SPENT A LOT OF TAXPAYER MONEY,

00:42:34.485 --> 00:42:37.021
GOT A GOOD RESULT, BUT IT WAS

00:42:37.087 --> 00:42:38.355
COMPLETELY WASTEFUL AND

00:42:38.422 --> 00:42:40.557
UNNECESSARY. THE SENATOR'S BILL

00:42:40.624 --> 00:42:42.493
RESOLVES THOSE PROBLEMS BY

00:42:42.559 --> 00:42:44.862
REQUIRING ANY PARTY TO A MERGER

00:42:44.929 --> 00:42:46.664
THAT HAS ITS PRINCIPAL PLACE OF

00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:48.799
BUSINESS IN OUR STATE, OR DOES

00:42:48.866 --> 00:42:51.635
MORE THAN 24 MILLION IN NET

00:42:51.702 --> 00:42:52.469
SALES IN OUR STATE TO SHARE

00:42:52.536 --> 00:42:54.204
THOSE FILINGS WITH OUR AG'S

00:42:54.271 --> 00:42:56.507
OFFICE SO WE CAN BE PART OF THE

00:42:56.573 --> 00:42:58.275
PROCESS EARLY ON. LASTLY, THE

00:42:58.342 --> 00:43:00.277
BILL HAS CONFIDENTIALITY

00:43:00.344 --> 00:43:01.745
PROTECTIONS THAT ARE STRONG

00:43:01.812 --> 00:43:02.880
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THIS

00:43:02.947 --> 00:43:05.015
BUSINESS INFORMATION IN THE LA

00:43:05.082 --> 00:43:07.217
TIMES OR SOME OTHER NEWSPAPER.

00:43:07.284 --> 00:43:09.620
SO THE AG'S OFFICE IS REQUIRED

00:43:09.687 --> 00:43:11.155
TO TAKE A NUMBER OF STEPS TO

00:43:11.221 --> 00:43:12.990
PRESERVE THAT CONFIDENTIALITY.

00:43:13.057 --> 00:43:15.526
AND SO, IN CLOSING, BOTH THE

00:43:15.592 --> 00:43:16.760
CALIFORNIA COMMISSION AND THE

00:43:16.827 --> 00:43:18.495
UNIFORM LAW COMMISSION STRONGLY

00:43:18.562 --> 00:43:20.631
SUPPORT SB 25. THANK YOU. THANK

00:43:20.698 --> 00:43:23.200
YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE HERE

00:43:23.267 --> 00:43:27.938
IN SUPPORT OF SB 25? IS THERE

00:43:28.005 --> 00:43:29.907
ANYONE HERE IN OPPOSITION TO SB

00:43:29.974 --> 00:43:38.849
25? ALL RIGHT. GOOD MORNING,

00:43:38.916 --> 00:43:42.419
PEYMAN ROSHAN HERE. THERE'S A

00:43:42.486 --> 00:43:44.421
RECENT US SUPREME COURT OPINION

00:43:44.488 --> 00:43:48.592
THAT OCCURRED. WILLIAMS V REED.

00:43:48.659 --> 00:43:49.560
APOLOGIES FOR BEING A LITTLE OUT

00:43:49.626 --> 00:43:54.331
OF BREATH. THAT WAS IN FEBRUARY.

00:43:54.398 --> 00:43:57.534
NOW WE PRESENTED TO THE SENATE

00:43:57.601 --> 00:44:00.504
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AN ANALYSIS

00:44:00.571 --> 00:44:03.207
THAT SHOWS THAT THAT SUPREME

00:44:03.273 --> 00:44:06.610
COURT OPINION HAS RENDERED THE

00:44:06.677 --> 00:44:10.347
STATE BAR'S PROCEDURE. WE'RE ON

00:44:10.414 --> 00:44:14.184
A DIFFERENT BILL. NØ, THIS IS SB

00:44:14.251 --> 00:44:16.653
25. THAT'S OKAY. THANK YOU.

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:18.255
ANYONE ELSE? ALL RIGHT. WE'LL

00:44:18.322 --> 00:44:20.257
BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE. ANY

00:44:20.324 --> 00:44:22.893
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS? YES,

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:27.131
MADAM VICE CHAIR, PUTTING ON MY

00:44:27.197 --> 00:44:28.766
HAT FROM MY CORPORATE EXPERIENCE

00:44:28.832 --> 00:44:29.700
AND GOING THROUGH SEVERAL

00:44:29.767 --> 00:44:31.568
MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS FOR

00:44:31.635 --> 00:44:33.303
COMPANY HEADQUARTERED CORPORATE

00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:34.671
HEADQUARTERED IN DELAWARE BUT

00:44:34.738 --> 00:44:35.639
HEADQUARTERED ALSO IN THE STATE

00:44:35.706 --> 00:44:39.043
OF CALIFORNIA. GOING THROUGH THE

00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:40.344
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, FEDERAL

00:44:40.411 --> 00:44:41.545
TRADE COMMISSION. THAT'S NORMAL

00:44:41.612 --> 00:44:44.348
COURSE. THAT TOOK LONG ENOUGH.

00:44:44.415 --> 00:44:46.617
IS THIS BILL GOING TO JUST ADD

00:44:46.683 --> 00:44:48.652
ANOTHER LAYER OF REVIEW AND

00:44:48.719 --> 00:44:51.855
FILINGS AND FEES, AND HOW

00:44:51.922 --> 00:44:53.023
WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:54.491
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE OR THE

00:44:54.558 --> 00:44:55.826
FEDERAL TRADE AND OR THE FEDERAL

00:44:55.893 --> 00:44:57.394
TRADE COMMISSION, IS THAT GOING

00:44:57.461 --> 00:44:59.963
TO BE IN CONCERT? SO I'LL I'LL

00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:01.031
RESPOND. THEN I'LL LET MR.

00:45:01.098 --> 00:45:03.667
ROBBINS CORRECT ME. WHAT THIS

00:45:03.734 --> 00:45:05.135
BILL DOES IS IT DOESN'T ADD

00:45:05.202 --> 00:45:07.071
ANOTHER LAYER OF BUREAUCRACY TO

00:45:07.137 --> 00:45:08.839
THE PROCESS. WHAT IT DOES IS IT

00:45:08.906 --> 00:45:11.809
SAYS THAT YOU GO THROUGH

00:45:11.875 --> 00:45:13.610
BASICALLY BOTH PROCESSES AT THE

00:45:13.677 --> 00:45:15.813
SAME TIME. SO THE STATE AG GETS

00:45:15.879 --> 00:45:17.714
NOTICE AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE

00:45:17.781 --> 00:45:18.382
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GETS NOTICE

00:45:18.449 --> 00:45:19.983
IS THEY'RE DOING THEIR ANALYSIS.

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:22.553
THE STATE CAN DO ITS ANALYSIS

00:45:22.619 --> 00:45:24.054
VERSUS THE CURRENT PROCEDURE. IS

00:45:24.121 --> 00:45:25.656
THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, THE

00:45:25.722 --> 00:45:27.124
FTC, DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, THEY

00:45:27.191 --> 00:45:29.693
DO THEIR ANALYSIS. THEY SAY IT'S

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.328
OKAY. PRESUMABLY. THEN THE STATE

00:45:31.395 --> 00:45:33.330
SAYS, OKAY, LET US TAKE A LOOK

00:45:33.397 --> 00:45:35.599
AT IT. LET US TAKE ANOTHER YEAR

00:45:35.666 --> 00:45:38.402
TO REVIEW. SO THE THEORY IS THAT

00:45:38.469 --> 00:45:40.337
IF BOTH ARE NOTIFIED AT NEARLY

00:45:40.404 --> 00:45:42.372
THE SAME TIME, THAT THEY CAN DO

00:45:42.439 --> 00:45:45.342
THEM IN TANDEM. I'LL ASK MR.

00:45:45.409 --> 00:45:47.244
ROBBINS TO CORRECT ME NOW. SO,

00:45:47.311 --> 00:45:48.946
NO, THAT THAT'S ENTIRELY

00:45:49.012 --> 00:45:50.581
ACCURATE. AND FROM A FROM A

00:45:50.647 --> 00:45:52.182
BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE, WHEN

00:45:52.249 --> 00:45:53.550
YOU'RE ENTERING INTO A MERGER OR

00:45:53.617 --> 00:45:55.385
DOING AN ACQUISITION, WHAT YOU

00:45:55.452 --> 00:45:56.787
WANT IS CERTAINTY. YOU WANT IT

00:45:56.854 --> 00:45:58.155
TO BE COMPLETE. YOU DON'T WANT

00:45:58.222 --> 00:45:59.756
TO MAKE YOUR OMELET AND THEN

00:45:59.823 --> 00:46:01.558
HAVE SOMEBODY COME AND TELL YOU

00:46:01.625 --> 00:46:02.559
TO UNSCRAMBLE IT. AND SO WHAT

00:46:02.626 --> 00:46:04.995
WE'RE DOING HERE IS TO TRY TO

00:46:05.062 --> 00:46:07.564
HAVE ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE

00:46:07.631 --> 00:46:09.333
AUTHORITY TO CHALLENGE IT

00:46:09.399 --> 00:46:11.268
INVOLVED AT ONCE AND GET ONE

00:46:11.335 --> 00:46:13.070
DECISION. IT'S SORT OF IN

00:46:13.137 --> 00:46:14.371
CONTRAST TO WHAT HAPPENED IN THE

00:46:14.438 --> 00:46:16.306
CASE I MENTIONED IS FROM THE

00:46:16.373 --> 00:46:18.742
LATE 80S, BUT THE LUCKY ALPHA

00:46:18.809 --> 00:46:20.277
BETA MERGER, WE, YOU KNOW, FROM

00:46:20.344 --> 00:46:21.912
THEIR PERSPECTIVE, THEY GOT

00:46:21.979 --> 00:46:23.380
THEIR APPROVAL FROM THE FEDERAL

00:46:23.447 --> 00:46:24.348
TRADE COMMISSION AND THEY

00:46:24.414 --> 00:46:26.717
THOUGHT THEY WERE DONE. AND THEN

00:46:26.783 --> 00:46:28.785
CALIFORNIA SUED LATER THAT YEAR,

00:46:28.852 --> 00:46:30.721
AND THAT CASE WENT TO THE US

00:46:30.787 --> 00:46:32.723
SUPREME COURT. TWO YEARS OF

00:46:32.789 --> 00:46:34.391
ADDITIONAL UNCERTAINTY. IT'S NOT

00:46:34.458 --> 00:46:35.425
GOOD FOR THEM. THEY WANT TO KNOW

00:46:35.492 --> 00:46:37.861
THEIR DEAL IS DONE. THEY WANT TO

00:46:37.928 --> 00:46:39.129
INTEGRATE ALL THEIR ASSETS AND

00:46:39.196 --> 00:46:40.964
MOVE FORWARD AND COMPETE AS ONE,

00:46:41.031 --> 00:46:42.599
ONE ENTITY. SO I THINK THERE'S

00:46:42.666 --> 00:46:44.768
BENEFITS FOR BOTH SIDES. IT

00:46:44.835 --> 00:46:46.837
REDUCES THE DUPLICATION. WELL

00:46:46.904 --> 00:46:48.572
OKAY. JUST PLAYING THIS OUT. SO

00:46:48.639 --> 00:46:50.841
IF THE US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

00:46:50.908 --> 00:46:51.575
SUPPORTS THE MERGER AND THE

00:46:51.642 --> 00:46:52.843
FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION

00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:53.577
SUPPORTS THE MERGER, BUT THE

00:46:53.644 --> 00:46:55.312
STATE OF CALIFORNIA EVEN GOING

00:46:55.379 --> 00:46:57.014
THROUGH A PARALLEL PROCESS

00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:58.615
SIMULTANEOUSLY SAYS, WELL, WE'RE

00:46:58.682 --> 00:47:00.384
NOT SO SURE. SO THEY COULD STILL

00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:02.319
ACT UNILATERALLY TO DELAY THE

00:47:02.386 --> 00:47:04.555
MERGER. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:47:04.621 --> 00:47:05.956
YEAH. WHAT HAPPENED? SO GOING

00:47:06.023 --> 00:47:07.324
BACK TO OUR CASE, WHAT HAPPENED

00:47:07.391 --> 00:47:10.527
IN OUR CASE IS WE I WAS JUST A

00:47:10.594 --> 00:47:12.329
CLERK AT THE AG'S OFFICE IN THE

00:47:12.396 --> 00:47:14.731
80S, BUT WE WANTED SOME

00:47:14.798 --> 00:47:15.999
ADDITIONAL DIVESTITURES OF

00:47:16.066 --> 00:47:17.367
CERTAIN STORES SO THERE'D BE

00:47:17.434 --> 00:47:18.769
MORE COMPETITION IN SOME

00:47:18.835 --> 00:47:20.604
CALIFORNIA TOWNS. AND THE

00:47:20.671 --> 00:47:22.272
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEGLECTED TO

00:47:22.339 --> 00:47:24.675
DO THAT. SO ONCE, YOU KNOW,

00:47:24.741 --> 00:47:26.376
EVENTUALLY WE GOT THAT. BUT I

00:47:26.443 --> 00:47:27.911
THINK IF WE WERE TOGETHER, WE

00:47:27.978 --> 00:47:29.246
WOULD HAVE SAID, LOOK, YOU KNOW,

00:47:29.313 --> 00:47:30.514
THIS IS OUR STATE. HERE'S A

00:47:30.581 --> 00:47:32.149
COUPLE PLACES YOU MAY NOT BE

00:47:32.216 --> 00:47:33.750
AWARE OF. WE NEED DIVESTITURES

00:47:33.817 --> 00:47:35.419
IN THOSE STATES TO ENSURE THAT

00:47:35.485 --> 00:47:36.453
THERE'S MORE THAN ONE

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:39.389
SUPERMARKET IN THE TOWN. AND THE

00:47:39.456 --> 00:47:41.291
GOAL IS THAT THE FEDERAL

00:47:41.358 --> 00:47:42.426
GOVERNMENT WOULD WORK WITH US

00:47:42.492 --> 00:47:43.727
AND WE'D COME UP WITH ONE

00:47:43.794 --> 00:47:45.562
ANSWER. BUT BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:47:45.629 --> 00:47:46.897
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT WE MIGHT NOT

00:47:46.964 --> 00:47:48.732
AGREE WITH THE FEDERAL

00:47:48.799 --> 00:47:50.567
GOVERNMENT, AND THE STATE WOULD

00:47:50.634 --> 00:47:52.469
STILL BE ABLE TO SUE TO BLOCK

00:47:52.536 --> 00:47:53.770
THE MERGER IF THAT WERE THE

00:47:53.837 --> 00:47:55.205
CASE. BUT, YOU KNOW, GOING BACK

00:47:55.272 --> 00:47:57.741
TO THE CASE I MENTIONED, I THINK

00:47:57.808 --> 00:47:58.842
IF WE HAD BEEN INVOLVED, ALL

00:47:58.909 --> 00:48:00.210
THAT EXPENSE WOULD HAVE BEEN

00:48:00.277 --> 00:48:01.612
AVOIDED AND THE DEAL WOULD HAVE

00:48:01.678 --> 00:48:03.180
CLOSED A LOT SOONER BECAUSE WE

00:48:03.247 --> 00:48:05.048
DID ALLOW THE DEAL TO CLOSE.

00:48:05.115 --> 00:48:06.683
IT'S JUST THERE WERE SOME THINGS

00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:07.818
THAT THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:48:07.884 --> 00:48:10.254
HAD MISSED IN OUR VIEW. OKAY. SO

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:11.588
YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING THIS FOR

00:48:11.655 --> 00:48:13.190
ALL THESE YEARS SINCE THAT CASE

00:48:13.257 --> 00:48:14.391
AND HOPING THAT THERE WOULD BE

00:48:14.458 --> 00:48:15.792
SOME REFORM AND THIS COULD

00:48:15.859 --> 00:48:18.629
POSSIBLY BE THE ANSWER TO THAT.

00:48:18.695 --> 00:48:20.297
OKAY. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY

00:48:20.364 --> 00:48:22.165
MUCH. SO THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR.

00:48:22.232 --> 00:48:23.667
JUST TO BUILD ON THAT, I DO

00:48:23.734 --> 00:48:25.402
THINK THAT THE VICE CHAIRS

00:48:25.469 --> 00:48:27.304
QUESTION IS A GOOD ONE, AND I'M

00:48:27.371 --> 00:48:29.306
NOT SURE THAT YOUR ANSWER FULLY

00:48:29.373 --> 00:48:30.474
DELVED INTO WHAT SHE WAS GETTING

00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:32.909
AT. I THINK THAT, TO BE CLEAR,

00:48:32.976 --> 00:48:35.245
THIS IS MERELY MAKING SURE THAT

00:48:35.312 --> 00:48:36.880
THE DOCUMENTS THAT ARE BEING

00:48:36.947 --> 00:48:37.981
PROVIDED TO THE FEDERAL

00:48:38.048 --> 00:48:39.082
GOVERNMENT ARE BEING PROVIDED TO

00:48:39.149 --> 00:48:40.417
THE STATE AG'S OFFICE. HOWEVER,

00:48:40.484 --> 00:48:41.685
THE STATE AG'S OFFICE DOES NOT

00:48:41.752 --> 00:48:43.754
HAVE ANY STATUTORY OR

00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:45.389
CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO

00:48:45.455 --> 00:48:47.391
BLOCK A MERGER, THE SAME

00:48:47.457 --> 00:48:48.625
AUTHORITY THAT THE FEDERAL

00:48:48.692 --> 00:48:50.527
GOVERNMENT, THE FTC, FTC, HAS.

00:48:50.594 --> 00:48:53.163
CORRECT. NO, NO, WE. THAT'S

00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:55.299
INCORRECT. WE OKAY, SO THE

00:48:55.365 --> 00:48:57.467
FEDERAL LAW IS THE CLAYTON ACT.

00:48:57.534 --> 00:49:00.137
AND WHEN IT WAS WRITTEN IN 1914,

00:49:00.203 --> 00:49:01.905
THE AUTHORS ACTUALLY PUT

00:49:01.972 --> 00:49:03.674
DIRECTLY IN IT THAT THE FEDERAL

00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:04.975
GOVERNMENT CAN ENFORCE AND THE

00:49:05.042 --> 00:49:07.177
STATES CAN ENFORCE AS WELL. SO

00:49:07.244 --> 00:49:08.745
WE'RE ON EQUAL FOOTING WITH THE

00:49:08.812 --> 00:49:10.080
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UNDER THE

00:49:10.147 --> 00:49:11.548
UNDER THE FEDERAL LAW. IT'S JUST

00:49:11.615 --> 00:49:13.817
THAT WE DON'T GET THE BACKGROUND

00:49:13.884 --> 00:49:15.519
MATERIALS TO DO OUR JOB. IF

00:49:15.585 --> 00:49:17.154
THAT'S THE CASE, WHY DO YOU HAVE

00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:19.189
TO FILE A LAWSUIT? WHY DOES THE

00:49:19.256 --> 00:49:21.325
STATE AG HAVE TO FILE A LAWSUIT

00:49:21.391 --> 00:49:22.326
TO DO THAT, WHEREAS THE FEDERAL

00:49:22.392 --> 00:49:23.427
GOVERNMENT MERELY JUST DOESN'T

00:49:23.493 --> 00:49:24.027
APPROVE THE MERGER? NO. THEY

00:49:24.094 --> 00:49:25.796
WOULD HAVE TO FILE A LAWSUIT

00:49:25.862 --> 00:49:28.198
TOO. SO THE WAY IT WORKS AT THE

00:49:28.265 --> 00:49:29.299
FEDERAL AGENCIES IS YOU SUBMIT

00:49:29.366 --> 00:49:32.302
YOUR MATERIALS AND, YOU KNOW,

00:49:32.369 --> 00:49:35.272
98% OF THE TIME, THEY SAY, FINE,

00:49:35.339 --> 00:49:37.374
2% OF THE TIME THEY ASK FOR MORE

00:49:37.441 --> 00:49:39.209
MATERIALS. AND THEN IN SOME

00:49:39.276 --> 00:49:40.711
SUBSET, LIKE FOR EXAMPLE,

00:49:40.777 --> 00:49:42.112
KROGER, ALBERTSONS, THEY

00:49:42.179 --> 00:49:44.948
ACTUALLY SUE. AND SO BUT TO

00:49:45.015 --> 00:49:46.717
ENFORCE THE CLAYTON ACT, THEY

00:49:46.783 --> 00:49:48.385
ACTUALLY HAVE TO GO TO COURT.

00:49:48.452 --> 00:49:50.087
AND THIS THIS ALLOWS THE PARTIES

00:49:50.153 --> 00:49:51.922
DUE PROCESS AND THE ABILITY TO

00:49:51.988 --> 00:49:53.290
DEFEND THEMSELVES AND SAY, HEY,

00:49:53.357 --> 00:49:54.224
THIS THIS IS ACTUALLY

00:49:54.291 --> 00:49:55.425
COMPETITIVE AND THIS WILL HELP

00:49:55.492 --> 00:49:56.760
CONSUMERS AND WORKERS. YOU'RE

00:49:56.827 --> 00:49:59.096
MISSING THE POINT. SO AS PART OF

00:49:59.162 --> 00:50:01.198
THEIR DUE PROCESS RIGHTS, THEY

00:50:01.264 --> 00:50:02.566
CAN THEY CAN GO TO COURT. GOT

00:50:02.632 --> 00:50:04.434
IT. YEAH. THAT WELL THANK YOU

00:50:04.501 --> 00:50:05.602
FOR CLARIFYING. I THOUGHT THAT

00:50:05.669 --> 00:50:08.505
ACTUALLY HSR APPROVAL WAS AN

00:50:08.572 --> 00:50:10.140
ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTION TO WHERE

00:50:10.207 --> 00:50:12.442
IT'S EITHER GIVEN OR IT ISN'T.

00:50:12.509 --> 00:50:13.377
AND YOU ACTUALLY DIDN'T HAVE TO

00:50:13.443 --> 00:50:15.245
FILE A CLAIM. THE FEDERAL

00:50:15.312 --> 00:50:16.380
GOVERNMENT DIDN'T ACTUALLY HAVE

00:50:16.446 --> 00:50:17.180
TO FILE A CLAIM. THEY WOULD JUST

00:50:17.247 --> 00:50:19.750
NOT APPROVE IT. SO I APPRECIATE

00:50:19.816 --> 00:50:20.350
THE QUESTION. JUST WANT TO

00:50:20.417 --> 00:50:22.052
FOLLOW UP TO MAKE SURE THAT I

00:50:22.119 --> 00:50:23.420
UNDERSTOOD IT. SO I AM GOING TO

00:50:23.487 --> 00:50:25.222
SUPPORT THE BILL AND I

00:50:25.288 --> 00:50:26.690
APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY. SO

00:50:26.757 --> 00:50:27.324
THANK YOU. WELL, THANK YOU VERY

00:50:27.391 --> 00:50:29.326
MUCH. AGAIN, I THINK WE NEED ONE

00:50:29.393 --> 00:50:30.627
MORE TO IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH

00:50:30.694 --> 00:50:33.630
QUORUM, AND WE CAN TAKE UP ANY

00:50:33.697 --> 00:50:34.431
MOTIONS. THEN WOULD YOU LIKE TO

00:50:34.498 --> 00:50:35.999
CLOSE, SIR? I URGE AND I VOTE

00:50:36.066 --> 00:50:38.201
THANK YOU. AND THEN YOU HAVE

00:50:38.268 --> 00:50:42.172
ITEM TWO, SB 36. SB 36 IS THE

00:50:42.239 --> 00:50:43.807
BILL THAT STRENGTHENS

00:50:43.874 --> 00:50:44.808
CALIFORNIA'S PRICE GOUGING LAWS.

00:50:44.875 --> 00:50:47.978
I WANT TO THANK SHARON ZOHAR AND

00:50:48.044 --> 00:50:49.679
THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK ON

00:50:49.746 --> 00:50:53.517
THIS BILL. THIS, BY THE WAY, I

00:50:53.583 --> 00:50:54.584
WILL ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE'S

00:50:54.651 --> 00:50:56.353
AMENDMENTS IN THE WAKE OF THE

00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:57.687
DEVASTATING FIRESTORM THAT SWEPT

00:50:57.754 --> 00:50:59.156
THROUGH SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN

00:50:59.222 --> 00:51:00.924
JANUARY OF 2025, THERE ARE

00:51:00.991 --> 00:51:02.392
REPORTS OF PRICE GOUGING. THERE

00:51:02.459 --> 00:51:04.661
ARE LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF

00:51:04.728 --> 00:51:06.663
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO CAME AND

00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:07.764
ASSISTED AND AIDED, BUT THERE

00:51:07.831 --> 00:51:10.267
WERE A FEW WHO TOOK ADVANTAGE OF

00:51:10.333 --> 00:51:11.768
THIS DISASTER AND ENGAGED IN

00:51:11.835 --> 00:51:12.869
PRICE GOUGING, PARTICULARLY AS

00:51:12.936 --> 00:51:15.639
IT RELATES TO SHELTERING

00:51:15.705 --> 00:51:17.474
OPPORTUNITIES AND HOUSING

00:51:17.541 --> 00:51:18.341
OPPORTUNITIES. MUCH LIKE DURING

00:51:18.408 --> 00:51:21.745
THE PANDEMIC, FOLKS EXPLOITED

00:51:21.812 --> 00:51:24.748
THE CIRCUMSTANCE TO BE ABLE TO

00:51:24.815 --> 00:51:27.517
RAISE PRICES BEYOND THAT WHICH

00:51:27.584 --> 00:51:29.753
WOULD BE CONSCIONABLE. AND WHAT

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:31.855
THIS DOES IS IT REQUIRES, FOR

00:51:31.922 --> 00:51:33.256
EXAMPLE, LISTING PLATFORMS,

00:51:33.323 --> 00:51:34.791

PROPERTIES TO IF THEY KNOW THAT

00:51:37.727 --> 00:51:39.796
THERE'S PRICE GOUGING THAT IS

00:51:39.863 --> 00:51:41.231
OCCURRING, THEY'RE REQUIRED TO

00:51:41.298 --> 00:51:43.066
ALERT LOCAL, REGIONAL OR STATE

00:51:43.133 --> 00:51:45.836
LAW ENFORCEMENT AS TO THE PRICE

00:51:45.902 --> 00:51:48.772
GOUGING. IT ALSO PROVIDES

00:51:48.839 --> 00:51:50.173
CONSUMERS THE ABILITY TO FILE

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:52.042
ACTIONS AGAINST PRICE GOUGERS,

00:51:52.108 --> 00:51:53.510
AND AUTHORIZES PUBLIC

00:51:53.577 --> 00:51:54.444
PROSECUTORS THE ABILITY TO

OBTAIN WARRANTS FOR PRICE

00:51:55.245 --> 00:51:56.880

HOUSING, LODGING, AND RENTAL

00:51:58.548 --> 00:52:00.016
VIOLATIONS. WITH ME TO TESTIFY

HERE TO EXPRESS OUR STRONG

00:52:11.161 --> 00:52:13.530
SUPPORT FOR SB 36. CALIFORNIA'S

00:52:13.597 --> 00:52:14.431
COMMUNITIES ARE FACING

00:52:14.498 --> 00:52:16.500
COMPOUNDING DISASTERS, FROM

00:52:16.566 --> 00:52:17.968
WILDFIRES TO FLOODS. AND IN THE

00:52:18.034 --> 00:52:18.635
AFTERMATH, WE'RE SEEING

00:52:18.702 --> 00:52:20.170
VULNERABLE RESIDENTS EXPLOITED

00:52:20.237 --> 00:52:21.571
BY EXTREME HOUSING PRICE

00:52:21.638 --> 00:52:23.573
GOUGING. SOME FAMILIES HAVE BEEN

00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:24.474
CHARGED THOUSANDS OF STANDARD

00:52:24.541 --> 00:52:25.442
RENT WHEN THEY'RE ALREADY

00:52:25.509 --> 00:52:27.811
DISPLACED IN A CRISIS. SB 36 IS

00:52:27.878 --> 00:52:29.479
A CRITICAL RESPONSE. IT

00:52:29.546 --> 00:52:30.881
STRENGTHENS CIVIL PENALTIES,

00:52:30.947 --> 00:52:32.716
EMPOWERS VICTIM TO TAKE LEGAL

00:52:32.782 --> 00:52:33.950

REQUIREMENTS AND COORDINATES

00:52:36.286 --> 00:52:38.054
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. IT ALSO

00:52:38.121 --> 00:52:40.423
EXPANDS PROTECTIONS TO

00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:41.258
DISPLACEMENT THAT OFTEN PUSHES

00:52:41.324 --> 00:52:42.425
PEOPLE OUT TO OTHER COUNTIES.

00:52:42.492 --> 00:52:43.760
THESE ARE SMART, TARGETED

00:52:43.827 --> 00:52:44.895
REFORMS THAT CLOSE DANGEROUS

00:52:44.961 --> 00:52:45.996
LOOPHOLES AND ENSURE

00:52:46.062 --> 00:52:47.297
CALIFORNIANS AREN'T VICTIMIZED

00:52:47.364 --> 00:52:49.699

URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU.

00:52:51.067 --> 00:52:52.836

CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. THANK

00:53:05.916 --> 00:53:12.989
OPPOSITION TO SB 36? MR.

00:53:13.056 --> 00:53:14.124
CHAIRMAN, HORACIO GONZALEZ, ON

00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:15.592
BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA'S BUSINESS

00:53:15.659 --> 00:53:16.560
ROUNDTABLE, WE DO APOLOGIZE TO

00:53:16.626 --> 00:53:18.061
THE AUTHOR AND THE COMMITTEE.

00:53:18.128 --> 00:53:20.931
OUR LETTER WAS NOT IN ON TIME TO

00:53:20.997 --> 00:53:22.032
BE REFLECTED IN THE ANALYSIS,

00:53:22.098 --> 00:53:22.499
BUT WE ARE RESPECTFUL

00:53:22.566 --> 00:53:24.167
OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. THANK

00:53:24.234 --> 00:53:28.505
YOU. BACK TO COMMITTEE. ANY

00:53:28.572 --> 00:53:31.875
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS? AS A

00:53:31.942 --> 00:53:35.045
MEMBER, JUST WANT TO THANK THE

00:53:35.111 --> 00:53:37.213
AUTHOR FOR THE BILL, OBVIOUSLY

00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:38.548
REPRESENTING ONE OF THE AREAS

00:53:38.615 --> 00:53:40.283
AFFECTED BY THE FIRES. LET'S BE

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:42.619
TOTALLY CLEAR, PRICE GOUGING HAS

00:53:42.686 --> 00:53:44.054
OCCURRED FROM DAY ONE. IT IS

00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:46.489
STILL OCCURRING, AND THERE HAVE

00:53:46.556 --> 00:53:48.592
BEEN VERY FEW WAYS FOR CONSUMERS

00:53:48.658 --> 00:53:50.360
WHO ARE BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF

00:53:50.427 --> 00:53:51.828
IN THE HOUSING MARKET OR

00:53:51.895 --> 00:53:52.629
OTHERWISE, TO ACTUALLY

00:53:52.696 --> 00:53:54.764
AMELIORATE THE SITUATION AND GET

00:53:54.831 --> 00:53:56.333
RELIEF. THIS BILL HELPS. I THINK

00:53:56.399 --> 00:53:58.768
IT'S A IT'S A VERY IT'S A VERY

00:53:58.835 --> 00:54:00.170
ELEGANT SOLUTION. I THINK WE

00:54:00.236 --> 00:54:02.305
NEED TO DO MORE. AND I DO THINK

00:54:02.372 --> 00:54:03.506
THE PROBLEM, AND I'VE SAID IT

00:54:03.573 --> 00:54:04.641
BEFORE WITH SIMILAR BILLS, IS

00:54:04.708 --> 00:54:06.276
THERE IS A PERVERSE INCENTIVE

00:54:06.343 --> 00:54:08.044
BECAUSE THOSE BEING VICTIMIZED

00:54:08.111 --> 00:54:10.280
NEED THE HOUSING, THEY NEED THE

00:54:10.347 --> 00:54:10.947
SERVICE, WHATEVER THEY'RE PAYING

00:54:11.014 --> 00:54:14.017
FOR. AND THEY HAVE THIS CHOICE

00:54:14.084 --> 00:54:16.252
OF EITHER FORGOING THE HOUSE,

00:54:16.319 --> 00:54:19.689
WHICH THEY'RE BEING GOUGED ON,

00:54:19.756 --> 00:54:21.858
AND TRYING TO FIND A PLACE FOR

00:54:21.925 --> 00:54:24.094
THEM AND THEIR AND THEIR KIDS TO

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:25.762
SLEEP, OR TAKING THE PRICE,

00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:27.964
WHICH IS UNFAIR. AND I THINK

00:54:28.031 --> 00:54:30.100
THAT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY

00:54:30.166 --> 00:54:32.202
IN WHICH MORE OF THE CASES OF

00:54:32.268 --> 00:54:34.104
GOUGING ARE REPORTED AND ACTED

00:54:34.170 --> 00:54:36.439
UPON BY THE WHICHEVER AUTHORITY

00:54:36.506 --> 00:54:38.341
NEEDS TO ACT UPON IT, WHERE IT

00:54:38.408 --> 00:54:40.176
ISN'T INCUMBENT ON THE VICTIM,

00:54:40.243 --> 00:54:41.411
NECESSARILY TO GIVE UP THE

00:54:41.478 --> 00:54:43.146
SERVICE OR OR THE PLACE THAT

WE'RE DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT THIS

01:11:36.925 --> 01:11:38.594

01:12:06.955 --> 01:12:07.823
COMMITTEE FOR ANY MOTIONS,

01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:11.093
QUESTIONS, CONCERNS. MADAM VICE

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:14.463
CHAIR. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. I

01:12:14.530 --> 01:12:16.665
SHARE THOSE COMMENTS FROM THE

01:12:16.732 --> 01:12:18.901
OPPOSITION. THE CONFIDENTIALITY

01:12:18.967 --> 01:12:20.969
OF THE JUVENILES OR ANYONE, BUT

01:12:21.036 --> 01:12:24.073
ESPECIALLY JUVENILES AS A GROW

01:12:24.139 --> 01:12:25.808
INTO BEING ADULT TO HAVE THEIR

01:12:25.874 --> 01:12:27.843
JUVENILE RECORD OPENED AND NOT

01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:30.112
SUPERVISED BY THE COURT. THAT'S

01:12:30.179 --> 01:12:34.783
A CONCERN THAT I HAVE. WHEN JUST

01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:36.852
TO ASK YOU, IF I MAY, A

01:12:36.919 --> 01:12:38.320
QUESTION, YOU TALK ABOUT THE

01:12:38.387 --> 01:12:39.088
PLAINTIFFS WHO ARE THE

01:12:39.154 --> 01:12:41.490
PLAINTIFFS IN THIS CASE. SO THE

01:12:41.557 --> 01:12:43.659
PLAINTIFFS WOULD BE A YOUTH,

01:12:43.726 --> 01:12:45.060
FORMER YOUTH THAT WAS IN THE

01:12:45.127 --> 01:12:46.095
SYSTEM, PERHAPS THEIR PARENT OR

01:12:46.161 --> 01:12:49.098
THEIR GUARDIAN. SOMETIMES IT'S A

01:12:49.164 --> 01:12:52.668
SIBLING, BUT WE ENSURE THROUGH

01:12:52.735 --> 01:12:55.137
THE BILL AND 827 ITSELF THAT ALL

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:56.905
OF THE MANDATORY REDACTIONS

01:12:56.972 --> 01:12:59.208
WOULD BE MADE. SO THINGS LIKE

01:12:59.274 --> 01:13:01.276
THEIR ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

01:13:01.343 --> 01:13:03.145
REPORTING, PARTY INFORMATION,

01:13:03.212 --> 01:13:04.179
HEALTH, MENTAL HEALTH

01:13:04.246 --> 01:13:05.347
INFORMATION, THINGS LIKE THAT

01:13:05.414 --> 01:13:07.382
ARE ALL REDACTED BEFORE THE

01:13:07.449 --> 01:13:09.518
RECORDS ARE RELEASED. COULD ANY

01:13:09.585 --> 01:13:12.121
OTHER PARTY TO THAT CASE ACCESS

01:13:12.187 --> 01:13:13.756
THESE JUVENILE RECORDS WITHOUT

01:13:13.822 --> 01:13:17.159
THE PERMISSION OF THE COURT? SO

01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:18.827
THE PARTIES THEMSELVES ARE

01:13:18.894 --> 01:13:21.196
NORMALLY ENTITLED UNDER 827

01:13:21.263 --> 01:13:22.097
THEMSELVES TO ACCESS THE

01:13:22.164 --> 01:13:23.732
RECORDS. SO THE MINOR, THE

01:13:23.799 --> 01:13:25.033
PARENT, THE CHILD WELFARE AGENCY

01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:26.368
OR THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT,

01:13:26.435 --> 01:13:28.237
THEY ARE AUTOMATICALLY ENTITLED

01:13:28.303 --> 01:13:30.172
UNDER WILK 827. ALREADY IT'S

01:13:30.239 --> 01:13:31.907
JUST THE ATTORNEYS FOR THE

01:13:31.974 --> 01:13:34.009
PARTIES IN THE CIVIL LITIGATION

01:13:34.076 --> 01:13:36.545
THAT RIGHT NOW UNDER 827, NEED

01:13:36.612 --> 01:13:37.980
TO PETITION. THE JUVENILE COULD

01:13:38.046 --> 01:13:41.650
BE ANOTHER PARTY, BUT NOT THE

01:13:41.717 --> 01:13:44.553
JUVENILE. IN ON THE RECORD. I

01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:46.388
MEAN, IT COULD BE SOMEBODY ELSE,

01:13:46.455 --> 01:13:47.823
ANOTHER ATTORNEY, BUT IT'S GOING

01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:49.825
TO BE UNSUPERVISED. ACCESS TO

01:13:49.892 --> 01:13:51.593
THAT INFORMATION IS

01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:53.061
UNSUPERVISED. SO THE ACCESS TO

01:13:53.128 --> 01:13:54.329
THE INFORMATION WOULD BE ONLY

01:13:54.396 --> 01:13:56.031
FOR THE ATTORNEYS IN

01:13:56.098 --> 01:13:57.099
REPRESENTING PARTIES IN THE

01:13:57.166 --> 01:13:58.967
PARTICULAR CIVIL LITIGATION. AND

01:13:59.034 --> 01:14:00.302
THAT LITIGATION HAS TO BE

01:14:00.369 --> 01:14:02.171
BROUGHT BY THE SUBJECT OF THE

01:14:02.237 --> 01:14:04.940
JUVENILE CASE FILE HAS TO NAME

01:14:05.007 --> 01:14:06.475
THE CHILD WELFARE DEPARTMENT OR

01:14:06.542 --> 01:14:07.876
PROBATION DEPARTMENT OR THEIR

01:14:07.943 --> 01:14:11.146
EMPLOYEE AS A DEFENDANT. AND THE

01:14:11.213 --> 01:14:12.514
PARTIES TO THAT LITIGATION ARE

01:14:12.581 --> 01:14:14.216
THE ATTORNEYS FOR THOSE PARTIES

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:15.784
WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THIS

01:14:15.851 --> 01:14:18.287
HEAVILY REDACTED VERSIONS OF THE

01:14:18.353 --> 01:14:19.788
DOCUMENTS AND BE ALLOWED TO USE

01:14:19.855 --> 01:14:22.524
THEM IN THE CIVIL PROCEEDING. IF

01:14:22.591 --> 01:14:24.059
ANYONE OTHER THAN THE SUBJECT OF

01:14:24.126 --> 01:14:26.695
THOSE RECORDS WOULD HAVE TO FILE

01:14:26.762 --> 01:14:27.996
ANY DOCUMENTS WITH THE COURT

01:14:28.063 --> 01:14:29.932
WITH AN APPLICATION OR MOTION TO

01:14:29.998 --> 01:14:32.067
SEAL THOSE DOCUMENTS, THAT GIVES

01:14:32.134 --> 01:14:34.303
THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE SUBJECT

01:14:34.369 --> 01:14:37.673
OF THE RECORDS TO OBJECT TO THAT

01:14:37.739 --> 01:14:38.307
SEALING, BECAUSE SOMETIMES THEY

01:14:38.373 --> 01:14:40.242
DO WANT THEIR RECORDS TO BE

01:14:40.309 --> 01:14:41.210
PUBLIC, OR THEY WANT TO BE ABLE

01:14:41.276 --> 01:14:43.545
TO USE THEM FOR OTHER INSTANCES.

01:14:43.612 --> 01:14:44.780
BUT WE THAT'S AN EXTRA

01:14:44.847 --> 01:14:46.882
PROTECTION THAT'S ADDED UNDER SB

01:14:46.949 --> 01:14:48.584
413. OKAY. THANK YOU. MAY I ASK

01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:51.620
THIS WITNESS TO LIKE TO RESPOND

01:14:51.687 --> 01:14:53.956
TO THOSE COMMENTS? YEAH, I THINK

01:14:54.022 --> 01:14:56.091
I CAN GIVE A COUPLE OF REAL LIFE

01:14:56.158 --> 01:14:58.493
EXAMPLES. SO FOR INSTANCE, OUR

01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:00.662
OUR LAW FIRM HAS REPRESENTED

01:15:00.729 --> 01:15:02.631
YOUTH WHO HAVE BEEN UNFAIRLY PUT

01:15:02.698 --> 01:15:05.167
IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT. AND OUR

01:15:05.234 --> 01:15:07.936
CONCERN REALLY IS THAT THAT THIS

01:15:08.003 --> 01:15:10.439
OPENS WITHOUT THE JUVENILE COURT

01:15:10.505 --> 01:15:12.007
REVIEWING WHAT SHOULD BE

01:15:12.074 --> 01:15:13.508
REDACTED AND WHAT SHOULD NOT BE

01:15:13.575 --> 01:15:15.644
REDACTED TO EXPEDITE THE BACKLOG

01:15:15.711 --> 01:15:18.513
OF CASES. WE ARE WE'RE BYPASSING

01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:20.582
THE COURT. WE'RE WE'RE THAT IS A

01:15:20.649 --> 01:15:22.150
PROTECTION FOR YOUTH. AND WHAT

01:15:22.217 --> 01:15:23.852
HAPPENS IS, IF THE COURT IS NOT

01:15:23.919 --> 01:15:25.387
REVIEWING IT, INFORMATION THAT

01:15:25.454 --> 01:15:27.155
SHOULDN'T BE IN THERE IS BEING

01:15:27.222 --> 01:15:29.191
EXPOSED TO THE PARTY. SO IT MAY

01:15:29.258 --> 01:15:31.260
BE THAT THE YOUTH HAD A BEHAVIOR

01:15:31.326 --> 01:15:33.562
AT AGE EIGHT THAT IS IN THEIR

01:15:33.629 --> 01:15:35.030
JUVENILE CASE FILE THAT THEN,

01:15:35.097 --> 01:15:36.798
YOU KNOW, IS COMPLETELY

01:15:36.865 --> 01:15:37.900
IRRELEVANT TO THE CASE BEFORE

01:15:37.966 --> 01:15:39.968
THEM OF BEING HARMED AND CARE.

01:15:40.035 --> 01:15:41.336
THIS IS ALSO DEEPLY PERSONAL TO

01:15:41.403 --> 01:15:43.105
ME BECAUSE I HAVE A FOSTER YOUTH

01:15:43.171 --> 01:15:45.841
IN MY IN MY CARE WHO WHO HAS WHO

01:15:45.908 --> 01:15:47.976
WE HAVE HAD TO SUE FOR HARM. AND

01:15:48.043 --> 01:15:49.544
SO IF YOU'RE ATTACHING THE

01:15:49.611 --> 01:15:50.913
JUVENILE CASE FILE WITHOUT GOING

01:15:50.979 --> 01:15:52.781
TO THE COURT, INFORMATION THAT

01:15:52.848 --> 01:15:54.416
IS IRRELEVANT TO THE CASE CAN BE

01:15:54.483 --> 01:15:57.152
USED AGAINST THE MINOR. OKAY.

01:15:57.219 --> 01:15:59.821
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU,

01:15:59.888 --> 01:16:01.390
MR. CHAIR. I'LL MOVE THE BILL

01:16:01.456 --> 01:16:04.726
SECOND, SECOND, SECOND. AND.

01:16:04.793 --> 01:16:06.361
YEAH, AND I APPRECIATE THE

01:16:06.428 --> 01:16:06.962
AUTHOR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS,

01:16:07.029 --> 01:16:08.463
BUT I DO THINK NARROW IT

01:16:08.530 --> 01:16:09.965
SOMEWHAT. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE

01:16:10.032 --> 01:16:13.468
SEALING REQUIREMENTS. I THINK,

01:16:13.535 --> 01:16:16.138
YOU KNOW, THE FIT, THE

01:16:16.204 --> 01:16:17.606
INTENTIONS OF THE BILL. WHILE I

01:16:17.673 --> 01:16:19.308
HOPE AT LEAST LAYING SOME OF THE

01:16:19.374 --> 01:16:20.575
CONCERNS THAT HAVE APPROPRIATELY

01:16:20.642 --> 01:16:21.877
BEEN BROUGHT BY OPPOSITION. SO I

01:16:21.944 --> 01:16:22.945
APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR FOR

01:16:23.011 --> 01:16:24.379
ACCEPTING THOSE AMENDMENTS. AND

01:16:24.446 --> 01:16:26.581
I'M HOPEFUL. AND OF COURSE, YOU

01:16:26.648 --> 01:16:29.418
KNOW, WE'LL SEE MOVING FORWARD.

01:16:29.484 --> 01:16:30.919
YOU KNOW, HOW IT'S IMPLEMENTED.

01:16:30.986 --> 01:16:32.287
BUT I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE'VE

01:16:32.354 --> 01:16:33.555
STRUCK THE RIGHT BALANCE THROUGH

01:16:33.622 --> 01:16:35.290
THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE AND

01:16:35.357 --> 01:16:38.727
THE AUTHOR SO THAT THAT THE

01:16:38.794 --> 01:16:40.295
RECORDS ARE APPROPRIATELY CARED

01:16:40.362 --> 01:16:42.731
FOR AND PROTECTED AND USED JUST

01:16:42.798 --> 01:16:44.566
FOR THE PURPOSES AS LAID OUT IN

01:16:44.633 --> 01:16:46.101
THE LEGISLATION. WOULD YOU LIKE

01:16:46.168 --> 01:16:47.669
TO CLOSE? I KNOW, THANK YOU.

01:16:47.736 --> 01:16:49.871
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE OUR

01:16:49.938 --> 01:16:51.073
DISCUSSIONS WITH THE OPPOSITION.

01:16:51.139 --> 01:16:53.408
WE'VE ALREADY GOT A NUMBER OF

01:16:53.475 --> 01:16:54.810
SIMILARLY SITUATED GROUPS OF

01:16:54.876 --> 01:16:55.711
OPPOSITION, AND WE'RE CERTAINLY

01:16:55.777 --> 01:16:57.279
GOING TO CONTINUE THE

01:16:57.346 --> 01:16:59.081
CONVERSATION. BUT THIS IS

01:16:59.147 --> 01:17:00.248
ULTIMATELY ABOUT, YOU KNOW, A

01:17:00.315 --> 01:17:01.883
VERY LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES WITH

01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:03.819
WHICH THESE FILES CAN BE

01:17:03.885 --> 01:17:05.354
ACCESSED. AND WE THINK WE'VE

01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:08.156
STRUCK A REASONABLE BALANCE. AND

01:17:08.223 --> 01:17:09.491
BUT WE'LL KEEP WORKING ON IT.

01:17:09.558 --> 01:17:11.827
AND WITH THAT, I RESPECTFULLY

01:17:11.893 --> 01:17:12.627

01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:50.465
DIFFERENT TOPIC. THAT'S THE FUN

01:17:50.532 --> 01:17:54.136
THING ABOUT JUDICIARY. YEAH. SO

01:17:54.202 --> 01:17:56.438
THIS LET'S SWITCH GEARS FROM

01:17:56.505 --> 01:18:00.709
COURT PROCEEDINGS TO, TO CAR

01:18:00.776 --> 01:18:03.278
CHARGING. ALL RIGHT. SO OUR

01:18:03.345 --> 01:18:06.081
STATE AS YOU KNOW, HAS ADOPTED

01:18:06.148 --> 01:18:08.350
AMBITIOUS GOALS TO ADDRESS THE

01:18:08.417 --> 01:18:10.018
URGENCY OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS

01:18:10.085 --> 01:18:12.254
AND AIR POLLUTION CHALLENGES.

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:14.056
AND ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE

01:18:14.122 --> 01:18:20.495
HAVE AS WE TRY TO HELP FOLKS GET

01:18:20.562 --> 01:18:22.964
EVS IS THE LACK OF CHARGING

01:18:23.031 --> 01:18:24.833
INFRASTRUCTURE, RIGHT? WE YOU

01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:26.201
KNOW, I THINK OUR CALIFORNIA

01:18:26.268 --> 01:18:27.502
ENERGY, SEVERAL OF YOU WERE AT

01:18:27.569 --> 01:18:30.305
THE TRANSPORTATION, YOU KNOW,

01:18:30.372 --> 01:18:32.074
CONFERENCE LAST WEEK. YOU KNOW,

01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:33.708
THE ENERGY COMMISSION ESTIMATES

01:18:33.775 --> 01:18:35.477
THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED OVER 2

01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:36.344
MILLION CHARGING STATIONS TO

01:18:36.411 --> 01:18:38.814
SUPPORT EV DEMAND, WITH THE

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:40.015
REQUIREMENT THAT ALL NEW CARS

01:18:40.082 --> 01:18:41.817
SOLD IN CALIFORNIA WILL BE ZERO

01:18:41.883 --> 01:18:44.586
EMISSION BY 2035. AND THE SAD

01:18:44.653 --> 01:18:45.687
TRUTH IS, AND WE'VE ALL BEEN

01:18:45.754 --> 01:18:47.122
DISCUSSING THIS ON BOTH SIDES OF

01:18:47.189 --> 01:18:48.890
THE AISLE, SOMETHING LIKE 8% OF

01:18:48.957 --> 01:18:51.426
THE TOTAL NEED HAS BEEN

01:18:51.493 --> 01:18:54.596
INSTALLED AS OF LAST YEAR. SO

01:18:54.663 --> 01:18:58.266
EVEN IF THINGS GO HAYWIRE WITH

01:18:58.333 --> 01:19:00.769
THE REQUIREMENT AND, YOU KNOW,

01:19:00.836 --> 01:19:03.338
AND STILL WE KNOW THAT WE'RE,

01:19:03.405 --> 01:19:07.142
WE'RE WE'RE WOEFULLY UNDER

01:19:07.209 --> 01:19:08.877
RESOURCE WITH REGARDS TO THE

01:19:08.944 --> 01:19:09.878
CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE

01:19:09.945 --> 01:19:12.214
NEED RIGHT NOW. SO THE PRICE OF

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:13.815
EVS HAS BEEN DECREASING. BUT THE

01:19:13.882 --> 01:19:14.716
ACCESSIBILITY OF EV CHARGING

01:19:14.783 --> 01:19:16.585
STATIONS CAN CONTINUE TO BE AN

01:19:16.651 --> 01:19:18.186
ISSUE. AND ESPECIALLY FOR

01:19:18.253 --> 01:19:19.154
RESIDENTS OF MULTI-FAMILY

01:19:19.221 --> 01:19:21.323
HOUSING. YOU KNOW, I'M FORTUNATE

01:19:21.389 --> 01:19:24.226
ENOUGH TO HAVE MY OWN STANDALONE

01:19:24.292 --> 01:19:27.062
GARAGE AT MY TOWNHOUSE WHERE I

01:19:27.129 --> 01:19:29.865
CAN PLUG IN MY, MY CAR. BUT YOU

01:19:29.931 --> 01:19:31.399
HAVE SITUATIONS WHERE FOLKS WHO

01:19:31.466 --> 01:19:33.535
LIVE IN HOAS AND CONDOMINIUM

01:19:33.602 --> 01:19:35.370
COMPLEXES THAT ARE IN

01:19:35.437 --> 01:19:36.571
PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT

01:19:36.638 --> 01:19:37.305
SITUATIONS, SOMETIMES TO MAKE

01:19:37.372 --> 01:19:39.007
THE SWITCH, BECAUSE THEY MAY

01:19:39.074 --> 01:19:41.042
NEED TO USE COMMON AREA SPACES

01:19:41.109 --> 01:19:43.011
TO INSTALL A CHARGER. AGAIN, IN

01:19:43.078 --> 01:19:44.713
MY HOA, WE HAVE OUR OWN PERSONAL

01:19:44.779 --> 01:19:46.515
PARKING SPACES THAT WE HAVE SOME

01:19:46.581 --> 01:19:48.850
CONTROL OVER. BUT. BUT THERE ARE

01:19:48.917 --> 01:19:50.919
A LOT OF PLACES WHERE FOLKS

01:19:50.986 --> 01:19:53.522
SHARE THE PARKING SITUATION. SO

01:19:53.588 --> 01:19:55.123
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I TRIED TO

01:19:55.190 --> 01:19:56.791
ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. I AUTHORED

01:19:56.858 --> 01:20:00.095
SB 1016 TO REMOVE SOME OF THE

01:20:00.162 --> 01:20:00.595
BURDENSOME POLICIES THAT

01:20:00.662 --> 01:20:01.196
PREVENTED INSTALLATION OF EV

01:20:01.263 --> 01:20:03.865
CHARGERS IN HOMES. BUT THE BILL

01:20:03.932 --> 01:20:05.333
DID NOT REMOVE A REQUIREMENT

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:06.968
THAT THE HOMEOWNER OBTAIN AN

01:20:07.035 --> 01:20:08.069
INSURANCE POLICY THAT NAMES THE

01:20:08.136 --> 01:20:10.639
HOA AS AN ADDITIONAL INSURED,

01:20:10.705 --> 01:20:12.741
AND THAT WAS A, I THINK,

01:20:12.807 --> 01:20:13.775
SOMETHING THAT WE DIDN'T QUITE

01:20:13.842 --> 01:20:15.744
UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS OF

01:20:15.810 --> 01:20:17.345
AT THE TIME. IT'S PART OF WHY

01:20:17.412 --> 01:20:18.880
I'M BACK WITH THIS BILL, THE

01:20:18.947 --> 01:20:20.182
CHALLENGE THAT WE'VE RUN INTO IS

01:20:20.248 --> 01:20:22.551
THAT REQUIRING THE HOA TO BE

01:20:22.617 --> 01:20:24.052
NAMED AS AN ADDITIONAL INSURED

01:20:24.119 --> 01:20:26.154
UNDER THE POLICY ENDS UP

01:20:26.221 --> 01:20:27.789
CONFUSING EV DRIVERS AND HOAS

01:20:27.856 --> 01:20:29.457
ALIKE AS THEY TRY TO UNDERSTAND

01:20:29.524 --> 01:20:30.358
WHAT INSURANCE THEY'RE SUPPOSED

01:20:30.425 --> 01:20:32.360
TO HAVE. AND THE BIG CHALLENGE

01:20:32.427 --> 01:20:34.095
THAT WE'VE RUN INTO IS THAT

01:20:34.162 --> 01:20:35.230
THESE TYPES OF POLICIES HAVE

01:20:35.297 --> 01:20:36.398
BEEN PROVEN DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN,

01:20:36.464 --> 01:20:38.066
PARTLY BECAUSE THE MARKET IS

01:20:38.133 --> 01:20:40.235
JUST GETTING STARTED. WE'VE HAD

01:20:40.302 --> 01:20:41.670
SOME SITUATIONS, SOME CONSUMERS

01:20:41.736 --> 01:20:42.904
THAT HAVE REPORTED CONTACTING

01:20:42.971 --> 01:20:44.506
OVER A DOZEN INSURANCE AGENTS

01:20:44.573 --> 01:20:45.874
WITHOUT FINDING THAT ANY WOULD

01:20:45.941 --> 01:20:47.209
PROVIDE A POLICY THAT NAMES THE

01:20:47.275 --> 01:20:49.277
HOA AS AN ADDITIONAL INSURED.

01:20:49.344 --> 01:20:50.445
OTHERS HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THEIR

01:20:50.512 --> 01:20:52.147
PREMIUMS WOULD MORE THAN DOUBLE

01:20:52.214 --> 01:20:53.415
JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE PUTTING IN

01:20:53.481 --> 01:20:55.317
PLACE THIS EV CHARGER WITH NO

01:20:55.383 --> 01:20:57.085
GOOD EXPLANATION AS TO WHY. I

01:20:57.152 --> 01:20:59.754
MEAN, THE TRUTH IS, WHEN WE

01:20:59.821 --> 01:21:01.890
FIRST ROLLED OUT THE EV CHARGING

01:21:01.957 --> 01:21:02.524
INFRASTRUCTURE, I THINK NOBODY

01:21:02.591 --> 01:21:04.993
KNEW WHAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE

01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:05.994
LIKE. THERE HAVE BEEN NO

01:21:06.061 --> 01:21:08.163
INCIDENCES OF DANGEROUS

01:21:08.230 --> 01:21:10.031
SITUATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH EV

01:21:10.098 --> 01:21:12.300
CHARGERS. YOU KNOW, AT THE MOST

01:21:12.367 --> 01:21:13.468
WHAT WE'VE HEARD IS THAT SOMEONE

01:21:13.535 --> 01:21:15.704
COULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT SOMEONE

01:21:15.770 --> 01:21:17.272
LEAVING THE CHARGER ON THE

01:21:17.339 --> 01:21:18.240
GROUND, MAYBE SOMEONE TRIPPING

01:21:18.306 --> 01:21:21.142
OVER THE CORD. I MEAN, THESE

01:21:21.209 --> 01:21:22.744
ARE, THESE ARE THESE ARE COMMON

01:21:22.811 --> 01:21:23.345
SITUATIONS THAT YOU HAVE WHEN

01:21:23.411 --> 01:21:25.480
PEOPLE ARE IN AND OUT OF PARKING

01:21:25.547 --> 01:21:27.515
LOTS AND THEY LEAVE THINGS

01:21:27.582 --> 01:21:28.316
BEHIND. AND THE PROBLEM THAT

01:21:28.383 --> 01:21:30.118
WE'VE RUN INTO IS THAT WITHOUT

01:21:30.185 --> 01:21:30.719
THE REQUIRED INSURANCE, HOA

01:21:30.785 --> 01:21:31.886
RESIDENTS ARE SAYING, YOU KNOW,

01:21:31.953 --> 01:21:33.355
I JUST CAN'T BUY, I CAN'T GET A

01:21:33.421 --> 01:21:35.690
CAR, I CAN'T GET AN EV BECAUSE

01:21:35.757 --> 01:21:37.692
I'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO CHARGE AT

01:21:37.759 --> 01:21:39.961
HOME. SO THAT'S WHAT THIS THIS

01:21:40.028 --> 01:21:42.030
BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS. I'M

01:21:42.097 --> 01:21:43.465
LOOKING FORWARD TO A GOOD

01:21:43.531 --> 01:21:44.499
DISCUSSION. I KNOW YOU'RE GOING

01:21:44.566 --> 01:21:46.334
TO HEAR FROM OUR FRIEND, FRIENDS

01:21:46.401 --> 01:21:47.736
FROM HOA WHO'VE GOT SOME

01:21:47.802 --> 01:21:51.106
CONCERNS, BUT BUT HERE TO

01:21:51.172 --> 01:21:52.274
TESTIFY AND SUPPORT. WE HAVE

01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:54.342
BRANDON WONG FROM CAL START.

01:21:54.409 --> 01:21:55.443
PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD MORNING,

01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:57.412
MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE

01:21:57.479 --> 01:21:58.413
COMMITTEE. HONESTLY, THE SENATOR

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:00.181
KIND OF TOOK IT AWAY. HE KIND OF

01:22:00.248 --> 01:22:01.916
HIT ALL THE MAIN POINTS. RIGHT?

01:22:01.983 --> 01:22:04.019
AND SO BRANDON WONG, ON BEHALF

01:22:04.085 --> 01:22:04.653
OF CAL START, WHERE CALIFORNIA

01:22:04.719 --> 01:22:05.987
BASED GLOBAL NONPROFIT, WE DO

01:22:06.054 --> 01:22:07.555
EVERYTHING WHEN IT COMES TO ZERO

01:22:07.622 --> 01:22:08.757
EMISSION VEHICLES. AND SO THAT

01:22:08.823 --> 01:22:10.158
SPANS THE GAMUT BETWEEN VEHICLE

01:22:10.225 --> 01:22:11.226
INCENTIVES. RIGHT. AND SO A LOT

01:22:11.293 --> 01:22:12.193
OF TIMES IT'S A HEAVY DUTY

01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:13.928
TRUCKING INCENTIVES. THAT

01:22:13.995 --> 01:22:14.596
TECHNOLOGY IS REALLY EXPENSIVE.

01:22:14.663 --> 01:22:15.530
BUT IT'S ALSO ADDRESSING POLICY

01:22:15.597 --> 01:22:17.032
BARRIERS. RIGHT. AND SO IN THE

01:22:17.098 --> 01:22:18.433
PAST THAT'S INCLUDED PUBLIC

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:19.634
PERMITTING BARRIERS FOR LIKE

01:22:19.701 --> 01:22:20.502
PUBLIC CHARGING STATIONS. AND WE

01:22:20.568 --> 01:22:21.670
REALLY VIEW THIS TYPE OF

01:22:21.736 --> 01:22:22.337
INSURANCE BARRIER AS ONE OF

01:22:22.404 --> 01:22:24.272
THOSE EXAMPLES THAT MAKE IT

01:22:24.339 --> 01:22:25.674
HARDER FOR REGULAR PEOPLE TO

01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:28.143
SWITCH OVER TO AN EV. AND SO THE

01:22:28.209 --> 01:22:29.210
SENATOR ACTUALLY ALLUDED TO IT

01:22:29.277 --> 01:22:29.978
DURING HIS COMMENTS, BUT WE'VE

01:22:30.045 --> 01:22:31.079
ACTUALLY RECEIVED A LOT OF

01:22:31.146 --> 01:22:32.380
PUBLIC FEEDBACK THROUGH JUST OUR

01:22:32.447 --> 01:22:34.015
GENERAL INBOX EMAILS OF PEOPLE

01:22:34.082 --> 01:22:35.650
SEEING THAT, YOU KNOW, OUR GROUP

01:22:35.717 --> 01:22:36.785
SUPPORTED THE SENATOR'S PREVIOUS

01:22:36.851 --> 01:22:38.353
LEGISLATION IN 2018, AND THEY

01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:39.688
WERE SAYING, HEY, WE'RE

01:22:39.754 --> 01:22:40.855
CONTINUING TO HAVE THESE

01:22:40.922 --> 01:22:42.991
PROBLEMS. AND, YOU KNOW, IN SOME

01:22:43.058 --> 01:22:43.658
CASES, THE POLICIES, THE

01:22:43.725 --> 01:22:45.460
PREMIUMS ARE DOUBLING IN PRICE.

01:22:45.527 --> 01:22:46.528
SOMETIMES THEY'RE JUST RUNNING

01:22:46.594 --> 01:22:47.696
AROUND EVERYWHERE AND THEY CAN'T

01:22:47.762 --> 01:22:49.097
FIGURE IT OUT. AND SO WE PUT A

01:22:49.164 --> 01:22:51.199
FEELER OUT ACTUALLY TO OUR OWN

01:22:51.266 --> 01:22:52.500
STAFF IN, IN HOUSE. AND IT

01:22:52.567 --> 01:22:53.535
HAPPENED. SO WE ACTUALLY DID

01:22:53.601 --> 01:22:55.637
HAVE AN EMPLOYEE BASED IN WEST

01:22:55.704 --> 01:22:56.905
SACRAMENTO WHO WAS DEALING WITH

01:22:56.971 --> 01:22:58.006
ESSENTIALLY THIS EXACT PROBLEM.

01:22:58.073 --> 01:22:59.474
RIGHT. AND SO THIS PROBLEM IS

01:22:59.541 --> 01:23:00.475
ACTUALLY PRETTY WIDESPREAD. IT'S

01:23:00.542 --> 01:23:02.410
A LOT MORE COMMONPLACE THAN WE

01:23:02.477 --> 01:23:03.311
MAY HAVE ANTICIPATED. AND LIKE

01:23:03.378 --> 01:23:05.013
THE SENATOR MENTIONED, IT'S

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:05.880
LARGELY ENFORCED, LARGELY

01:23:05.947 --> 01:23:07.082
UNNECESSARY IN THE SENSE THAT A

01:23:07.148 --> 01:23:08.550
LOT OF THESE CHARGERS, YOU CAN

01:23:08.616 --> 01:23:11.419
BUY THEM AT HOME DEPOT, RIGHT?

01:23:11.486 --> 01:23:11.986
THEY'RE ABOUT 200 OR $300.

01:23:12.053 --> 01:23:12.620
THEY'RE LARGELY SAFE. WE DON'T

01:23:12.687 --> 01:23:15.256
SEE A LOT OF ISSUES. A LOT OF

01:23:15.323 --> 01:23:15.790
CITIES HAVE VERY RIGOROUS

01:23:15.857 --> 01:23:16.658
PERMITTING AND SAFETY STANDARDS

01:23:16.725 --> 01:23:18.460
AT THE POINT OF INSTALLATION.

01:23:18.526 --> 01:23:19.594
AND WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A,

01:23:19.661 --> 01:23:21.429
YOU KNOW, A PANEL UPGRADE OR

01:23:21.496 --> 01:23:22.597
ELECTRICAL UPGRADE, A LOT OF

01:23:22.664 --> 01:23:24.032
THAT IS REQUIRED TO BE DONE BY

01:23:24.099 --> 01:23:25.834
LICENSED ELECTRICIANS AND DOES

01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:27.569
MEET DIFFERENT RIGOROUS SAFETY

01:23:27.635 --> 01:23:28.503
REQUIREMENTS. AND SO WHEN WE'RE

01:23:28.570 --> 01:23:30.071
TALKING ABOUT THIS ADDED

01:23:30.138 --> 01:23:32.207
INSURANCE REQUIREMENT, IN LARGE

01:23:32.273 --> 01:23:34.209
PART IT IS JUST AN UNDUE COMPLEX

01:23:34.275 --> 01:23:35.443
BARRIER THAT PEOPLE JUST DON'T

01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:36.911
KNOW HOW THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO

01:23:36.978 --> 01:23:38.413
NAVIGATE IT, BECAUSE ONE, THEY

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:39.447
OFTENTIMES DON'T EVEN KNOW THEY

01:23:39.514 --> 01:23:40.615
HAVE THAT REQUIREMENT. AND TWO,

01:23:40.682 --> 01:23:42.250
WHEN THEY GO TO AN INSURANCE

01:23:42.317 --> 01:23:43.017
AGENT, THEY'RE JUST THE

01:23:43.084 --> 01:23:45.253
INSURANCE AGENTS DON'T EVEN KNOW

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:45.887
WHAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO DO.

01:23:45.954 --> 01:23:48.189
RIGHT. AND SO IN THIS CASE, WHEN

01:23:48.256 --> 01:23:49.491
SOMEONE PULLS UP TO THEIR LOT

01:23:49.557 --> 01:23:51.126
AND THEY WANT TO BUY THE EV, THE

01:23:51.192 --> 01:23:52.727
FLASHY, FAST NEW EV THAT THEY'VE

01:23:52.794 --> 01:23:54.329
BEEN WAITING AND DYING TO BUY,

01:23:54.396 --> 01:23:55.930
RIGHT? THEY ALSO WANT TO BE ABLE

01:23:55.997 --> 01:23:57.332
TO CHARGE IT AT HOME. AND SO AT

01:23:57.399 --> 01:23:59.501
THE END OF THE DAY, THAT'S WHY

01:23:59.567 --> 01:24:01.503
WE'RE HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB 770.

01:24:01.569 --> 01:24:03.338
REALLY, IT'S JUST AS SIMPLE AS

01:24:03.405 --> 01:24:04.739
MAKING SURE PEOPLE CAN CHARGE IN

01:24:04.806 --> 01:24:05.306
THEIR GARAGE, EVEN THE NON

01:24:05.373 --> 01:24:07.409
FLASHY ONES. EVEN THE NON FLASHY

01:24:07.475 --> 01:24:08.343
ONES. YEAH. ALL RIGHT. THANK

CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE ACTION

01:24:41.443 --> 01:24:42.444
COMMITTEE. SO THE BOARD OF

01:24:42.510 --> 01:24:43.478

ASSOCIATIONS. SO AS THE SENATOR

01:24:45.380 --> 01:24:46.714
SAID, THIS BILL WOULD ACTUALLY

01:24:46.781 --> 01:24:47.816
REMOVE THE HOMEOWNERS THAT

01:24:47.882 --> 01:24:49.617
INSTALL EV CHARGERS TO NAME THE

01:24:49.684 --> 01:24:50.752
ASSOCIATION AS AN ADDITIONAL

01:24:50.819 --> 01:24:52.620
INSURED. THIS SHIFTS LIABILITY

01:24:52.687 --> 01:24:53.688
FROM THE INDIVIDUAL TO THE

01:24:53.755 --> 01:24:55.757
ENTIRE ASSOCIATION, POTENTIALLY

01:24:55.824 --> 01:24:57.025
RAISING INSURANCE PREMIUMS FOR

01:24:57.091 --> 01:24:58.326
ALL RESIDENTS, EVEN THOSE WHO

01:24:58.393 --> 01:25:00.361
DON'T HAVE AN EV CHARGER OR EV

01:25:00.428 --> 01:25:02.997
CAR. WHETHER FLASHY OR NOT, FOR

01:25:03.064 --> 01:25:05.066
YEARS, HOMEOWNERS HAVE BEEN ABLE

01:25:05.133 --> 01:25:06.568
TO GET THIS COVERAGE. WE HAVE

01:25:06.634 --> 01:25:08.102
BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM AT LEAST

01:25:08.169 --> 01:25:09.170
THREE MAJOR CARRIERS HERE IN

01:25:09.237 --> 01:25:10.171
CALIFORNIA WHO PROVIDE THIS

01:25:10.238 --> 01:25:12.740
COVERAGE. SO THIS ISN'T ABOUT

01:25:12.807 --> 01:25:14.909
ACCESS. WE THINK THIS IS ABOUT

01:25:14.976 --> 01:25:15.577
SHIFTING RESPONSIBILITY FROM THE

01:25:15.643 --> 01:25:18.079
INDIVIDUAL TO THE ASSOCIATION.

01:25:18.146 --> 01:25:19.214
WITHOUT PROPER PROTECTIONS FOR

01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:21.316
THE ASSOCIATION, THEY CAN FACE

01:25:21.382 --> 01:25:23.184
LEGAL AND FINANCIAL RISKS FROM

01:25:23.251 --> 01:25:24.953
ACCIDENTS, WHETHER THAT TRIP AND

01:25:25.019 --> 01:25:26.087
FALL INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS.

01:25:26.154 --> 01:25:28.189
THERE'S ABOUT I THINK 60% OF OUR

01:25:28.256 --> 01:25:29.357
ASSOCIATIONS ARE OLDER. THEY

01:25:29.424 --> 01:25:30.325
DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:25:30.391 --> 01:25:32.427
SO THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO GET AN

01:25:32.494 --> 01:25:33.962
ELECTRICIAN, POSSIBLY DIG UP

01:25:34.028 --> 01:25:34.963
PROPERTY, DIG UP PARKING LOTS IN

01:25:35.029 --> 01:25:36.898
THESE AREAS. THAT CAN BE COSTLY,

01:25:36.965 --> 01:25:38.233
AND THOSE WILL BE BORNE

01:25:38.299 --> 01:25:40.969
ESSENTIALLY BY BY OTHER

01:25:41.035 --> 01:25:41.603
HOMEOWNERS, AGAIN BY THOSE THAT

01:25:41.669 --> 01:25:43.905
DON'T EVEN HAVE AN EV. SO SHOULD

01:25:43.972 --> 01:25:45.139
THIS BILL COME OUT OF THE

01:25:45.206 --> 01:25:46.641
COMMITTEE TODAY, WE COMMIT TO

01:25:46.708 --> 01:25:48.276
WORKING WITH THE SENATOR BECAUSE

01:25:48.343 --> 01:25:49.644
WE THINK THIS IS MORE OF AN

01:25:49.711 --> 01:25:50.645
INSURANCE ISSUE, NOT NECESSARILY

01:25:50.712 --> 01:25:52.747
HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION ISSUE. SO

01:25:52.814 --> 01:25:54.015
FOR THOSE REASONS, WE STILL

01:25:54.082 --> 01:25:55.483
OPPOSE. THANK YOU. OKAY. VERY

01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:57.952
GOOD. ANY OTHER SPEAKERS IN

01:25:58.019 --> 01:25:59.120
OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD

01:25:59.187 --> 01:26:02.757
TO THE MICROPHONE. ALL RIGHT.

01:26:02.824 --> 01:26:05.460
SEEING NONE COME TO THE DÍAS THE

01:26:05.527 --> 01:26:07.028
COMMITTEE Þ QUESTIONS. MR.

01:26:07.095 --> 01:26:09.163
HERMITIAN. JUST REALLY QUICKLY

01:26:09.230 --> 01:26:10.598
FOR THE OPPOSITION. SO THE

01:26:10.665 --> 01:26:13.468
INSURANCE RISK AND I UNDERSTAND

01:26:13.535 --> 01:26:15.370
THE INSTALLATION COULD COULD

01:26:15.436 --> 01:26:17.272
INVOLVE SOME INFRASTRUCTURE KIND

01:26:17.338 --> 01:26:18.973
OF MODIFICATION. BUT IS THE

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:21.809
INSURANCE RISK MOSTLY BECAUSE OF

01:26:21.876 --> 01:26:23.678
FIRE OR WHAT'S THE I GUESS, WHAT

01:26:23.745 --> 01:26:25.547
IS THE RISK THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:26:25.613 --> 01:26:27.382
INSURE AGAINST. WELL, IT COULD

01:26:27.448 --> 01:26:28.349
BE A NUMBER OF THINGS. IT COULD

01:26:28.416 --> 01:26:29.450
BE, AGAIN, JUST THE ANNOYING

01:26:29.517 --> 01:26:31.519
LONG EXTENSION OF THE COURT. IT

01:26:31.586 --> 01:26:32.620
COULD BE A POTENTIAL FIRE FROM

01:26:32.687 --> 01:26:34.289
AN EV CHARGING STATION NOT BEING

01:26:34.355 --> 01:26:35.490
INSTALLED CORRECTLY. IT COULD BE

01:26:35.557 --> 01:26:37.559
THE CAR ITSELF. I MEAN, THOSE

01:26:37.625 --> 01:26:39.127
ARE SOME OF THE RISKS. AS IT WAS

01:26:39.193 --> 01:26:40.795
STATED EARLIER, A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:26:40.862 --> 01:26:43.298
ARE LOOKING TO MOVE INTO A MORE

01:26:43.364 --> 01:26:45.133
EV, LESS RELIANT ON GAS POWERED

01:26:45.199 --> 01:26:47.335
VEHICLES. SO EVS ARE JUST GOING

01:26:47.402 --> 01:26:48.303
TO CONTINUE TO COME. SO WE WANT

01:26:48.369 --> 01:26:50.371
TO MAKE SURE THAT IF THESE

01:26:50.438 --> 01:26:51.372
INSTALLATIONS HAPPEN, THAT THE

01:26:51.439 --> 01:26:52.674
ASSOCIATION IS COVERED WELL, I

01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:55.143
GUESS TWO OF TWO OF THOSE THREE

01:26:55.209 --> 01:26:55.810
YOU COULDN'T INSURE AGAINST. SO

01:26:55.877 --> 01:26:57.445
I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT.

01:26:57.512 --> 01:27:00.381
I MEAN, THE LENGTH OF THE CORD,

01:27:00.448 --> 01:27:01.849
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW HOW A

01:27:01.916 --> 01:27:03.184
POLICY COULD INSURE AGAINST

01:27:03.251 --> 01:27:05.153
THAT. SO I GUESS, DO YOU HAVE

01:27:05.219 --> 01:27:10.491
ANY EXAMPLES OF THIS LEADING TO

01:27:10.558 --> 01:27:11.159
SITUATIONS IN WHERE IN WHICH ANY

01:27:11.225 --> 01:27:14.696
OF YOUR CLIENTS, ANY HOA'S, WERE

01:27:14.762 --> 01:27:16.598
THEY EXPERIENCED DAMAGE OR HARM

01:27:16.664 --> 01:27:20.902
OR SOME SORT OF OUT-OF-POCKET?

01:27:20.969 --> 01:27:21.636
LIABILITY THAT THEY WEREN'T

01:27:21.703 --> 01:27:23.571
COVERED FOR? BECAUSE, LOOK, I

01:27:23.638 --> 01:27:26.507
AM, I GUESS, SYMPATHETIC IN A

01:27:26.574 --> 01:27:27.875
WAY. IF THIS IS AN ACTUAL

01:27:27.942 --> 01:27:29.544
PROBLEM, I DON'T SEE IT AS IT'S

01:27:29.611 --> 01:27:31.846
NOT CLEAR TO ME HOW IT COULD BE

01:27:31.913 --> 01:27:34.282
A PROBLEM. SO AND THANK YOU. IF

01:27:34.349 --> 01:27:36.117
YOU ANSWER THAT, THAT'S ALL I

01:27:36.184 --> 01:27:39.921
HAVE. THANK YOU, MR. TOWNSHIP.

01:27:39.988 --> 01:27:41.255
IF YOU CAN ANSWER THAT. OH. I'M

01:27:41.322 --> 01:27:42.957
SORRY. OH, OH, OH, SO IT WOULD.

01:27:43.024 --> 01:27:44.926
WE DON'T HAVE ANY WE DON'T HAVE

01:27:44.993 --> 01:27:47.862
ANY CASES THAT ARE IN COURT

01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:49.664
RIGHT NOW. BUT THE EXAMPLE THAT

01:27:49.731 --> 01:27:51.265
HAS BEEN GIVEN MORE AND MORE

01:27:51.332 --> 01:27:52.467
OFTEN THAN NOT IS SOMEONE TRIPS

01:27:52.533 --> 01:27:54.535
AND FALLS ON A CORD, BREAKS AN

01:27:54.602 --> 01:27:56.504
ELBOW, BREAKS AN ARM, GETS

01:27:56.571 --> 01:27:58.139
INJURED. THAT THAT IS THE

01:27:58.206 --> 01:27:59.907
EXAMPLE THAT WE'VE BEEN TOLD

01:27:59.974 --> 01:28:01.409
ABOUT BY INSURANCE COMPANIES AND

01:28:01.476 --> 01:28:02.610
THAT'S, YOU KNOW, IF THERE'S NO

01:28:02.677 --> 01:28:06.247
COVERAGE FOR THE WITH THIS BILL,

01:28:06.314 --> 01:28:08.282
THAT WOULD LEAVE THE ASSOCIATION

01:28:08.349 --> 01:28:10.184
LIABLE OR POTENTIALLY LIABLE IF

01:28:10.251 --> 01:28:12.020
THE COVERAGE WHICH IS ALREADY

01:28:12.086 --> 01:28:15.023
EXISTING WOULD COVER THAT UNDER

01:28:15.089 --> 01:28:15.857
THAT POLICY IS MY UNDERSTANDING.

01:28:15.923 --> 01:28:18.860
THANK YOU, MR. TOWNSHIP. THANK

01:28:18.926 --> 01:28:21.329
YOU. MORE ON THE INSURANCE

01:28:21.396 --> 01:28:22.430
ISSUE, BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE I

01:28:22.497 --> 01:28:24.065
THINK IT IS AS WELL. WOULD THE

01:28:24.132 --> 01:28:25.933
CASE BE LARGER ON MORE LIKE

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.735
THEFT AND VANDALISM? HAVE THEY

01:28:27.802 --> 01:28:30.071
SHARED WITH, YOU KNOW, IF THIS

01:28:30.138 --> 01:28:32.740
IS SHIFTED TOWARDS THE HOA OR

01:28:32.807 --> 01:28:34.609
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT, IF THERE

01:28:34.676 --> 01:28:36.644
ARE VANDALISM ISSUES WITH THE

01:28:36.711 --> 01:28:39.013
CHARGER, IS IT ON THE INSURANCE

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:41.082
COMPANIES TO REPLACE THAT? I'M

01:28:41.149 --> 01:28:43.651
NOT SURE THAT'S MORE OF AN

01:28:43.718 --> 01:28:46.120
INSURANCE QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR

01:28:46.187 --> 01:28:47.922
WITH WITH THIS SHIFTING THE

01:28:47.989 --> 01:28:49.357
BURDEN, IT WOULD DEPEND ON THE I

01:28:49.424 --> 01:28:51.325
MEAN THE POLICY. AND SO AND

01:28:51.392 --> 01:28:53.795
THAT'S WHERE I LOOK AT. AND THEN

01:28:53.861 --> 01:28:54.829
THERE'S A COUPLE OF CLARITY

01:28:54.896 --> 01:28:58.199
QUESTIONS BECAUSE. SO I TO LIVE

01:28:58.266 --> 01:29:01.102
IN A TOWNHOME HERE IN WEST SAC.

01:29:01.169 --> 01:29:03.504
IF I INSTALL AN INDIVIDUAL

01:29:03.571 --> 01:29:05.406
CHARGER IN MY PRIVATE GARAGE,

01:29:05.473 --> 01:29:06.774
THAT DOES NOT APPLY TO THIS,

01:29:06.841 --> 01:29:08.609
EVEN THOUGH THIS IS ONLY FOR

01:29:08.676 --> 01:29:10.578
AREAS WHERE FOLKS HAVE TO PARK

01:29:10.645 --> 01:29:12.914
IN A SHARED. SO IN A SHARED

01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:14.315
PARKING GARAGE SYSTEM. SO. AND

01:29:14.382 --> 01:29:17.652
WITH YOUR BILL SB 1016, THAT'S

01:29:17.719 --> 01:29:19.987
THE ONE WHERE THE INDIVIDUAL

01:29:20.054 --> 01:29:23.291
PROPERTY OR CONDO OWNER THEY

01:29:23.357 --> 01:29:25.026
WOULD PAY TO INSTALL THAT.

01:29:25.093 --> 01:29:27.228
RIGHT. BUT NOW THIS SHIFTS AFTER

01:29:27.295 --> 01:29:29.430
THEY PAID FOR THEIR INSTALLATION

01:29:29.497 --> 01:29:31.466
TOWARDS THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY

01:29:31.532 --> 01:29:33.134
DEVELOPMENT FOR THE COMMUNITY TO

01:29:33.201 --> 01:29:35.603
THEN FACTOR THAT INTO THEIR HOA.

01:29:35.670 --> 01:29:38.306
WELL, ONLY IF SO. SO ALL WE'RE

01:29:38.372 --> 01:29:40.208
DOING HERE IS SAYING THAT THAT

01:29:40.274 --> 01:29:44.679
THEY DON'T HAVE TO PUT THE HOA

01:29:44.746 --> 01:29:48.316
ON AS AN ADDITIONAL INSURED. SO

01:29:48.382 --> 01:29:51.052
TO THE EXTENT I MEAN, IT'S I,

01:29:51.119 --> 01:29:52.386
YOU KNOW, THIS IS KIND OF A

01:29:52.453 --> 01:29:54.322
WORST CASE SCENARIO TYPE OF TYPE

01:29:54.388 --> 01:29:56.357
OF ARGUMENT, WHICH IS YOUR JOB

01:29:56.424 --> 01:29:58.025
TO DO. RIGHT? THAT'S WHY WE'RE

01:29:58.092 --> 01:29:59.327
HERE. RIGHT. BUT BUT IN THE END

01:29:59.393 --> 01:30:01.696
OF THE DAY, HE'S SUGGESTING THAT

01:30:01.763 --> 01:30:03.998
IF THEY'RE NOT IF THE IF THE HOA

01:30:04.065 --> 01:30:05.099
IS NOT ADEQUATELY INSURED, THEN

01:30:05.166 --> 01:30:07.602
SOMEONE TRIPS AND FALLS ON A

01:30:07.668 --> 01:30:09.737
CORD AND THEN THEY COULD

01:30:09.804 --> 01:30:10.571
POTENTIALLY BE ON THE HOOK.

01:30:10.638 --> 01:30:12.306
THAT'S THAT'S I THINK THE

01:30:12.373 --> 01:30:13.608
ESSENTIAL CONCERN. YEAH. AND I

01:30:13.674 --> 01:30:15.009
UNDERSTAND ON THAT ONE ON THE

01:30:15.076 --> 01:30:16.244
LIABILITY SIDE, I MEAN I DON'T

01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:18.045
THINK THE TRIPPING PORTION OF IT

01:30:18.112 --> 01:30:19.514
IS REALLY WHAT I'M WORRIED

01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:21.482
ABOUT. I'M MORE WORRIED ON THE

01:30:21.549 --> 01:30:22.083
VANDALISM, COPPER THEFT, YOU

01:30:22.150 --> 01:30:23.151
KNOW, RISING CRIME THAT. DOES

01:30:23.217 --> 01:30:24.819
THE HOA HAVE TO REPLACE THAT

01:30:24.886 --> 01:30:26.788
BECAUSE THAT'S COVERED IN THEIR

01:30:26.854 --> 01:30:28.222
INSURANCE IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO

01:30:28.289 --> 01:30:30.124
THINK ABOUT. AND THE MAIN REASON

01:30:30.191 --> 01:30:32.160
WHY I THINK ABOUT IT A LOT, I

01:30:32.226 --> 01:30:33.194
JUST BELIEVE WE'RE IN AN

01:30:33.261 --> 01:30:34.362
INSURANCE CATASTROPHE IN THIS

01:30:34.428 --> 01:30:35.129
STATE. EXPANSIONS OF INSURANCE

01:30:35.196 --> 01:30:36.731
REALLY MAKE IT HARD. IT'S JUST

01:30:36.798 --> 01:30:39.467
IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SEE WHERE AN

01:30:39.534 --> 01:30:43.204
INDIVIDUAL WHO PUTS A CHARGING

01:30:43.271 --> 01:30:44.972
STATION IN A COMMON SHARED

01:30:45.039 --> 01:30:46.808
PARKING GARAGE. NOW THE

01:30:46.874 --> 01:30:49.343
INSURANCE SHIFTS OVER TO THE HOA

01:30:49.410 --> 01:30:51.379
OR THE KID. THAT'S THE PART

01:30:51.445 --> 01:30:53.614
WHERE I'M TRYING TO SEE, YOU

01:30:53.681 --> 01:30:55.783
KNOW, AND I UNDERSTAND STATE'S

01:30:55.850 --> 01:30:57.652
GOALS FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES, BUT

01:30:57.718 --> 01:30:59.720
IT REALLY SHIFTS THAT PORTION

01:30:59.787 --> 01:31:01.489
OVER TO EVERYBODY WHO WASN'T

01:31:01.556 --> 01:31:04.225
INVOLVED. YEAH, I MEAN, I'M IF

01:31:04.292 --> 01:31:07.328
THE CONCERN IS CONCERN IS COST

01:31:07.395 --> 01:31:08.596
COST FOR EVERYBODY INCREASING

01:31:08.663 --> 01:31:10.898
BECAUSE OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S

01:31:10.965 --> 01:31:13.868
INVESTMENT. YEAH. I MEAN THERE'S

01:31:13.935 --> 01:31:17.939
NOTHING STOPPING THE I MEAN, THE

01:31:18.005 --> 01:31:20.908
THING IS, IF SOMEONE VANDALIZES

01:31:20.975 --> 01:31:23.010
THAT'S NOT THE HOA'S

01:31:23.077 --> 01:31:25.313
RESPONSIBILITY, RIGHT? THE, THE

01:31:25.379 --> 01:31:27.815
PERSON WHO THE CAR OWNER WHO

01:31:27.882 --> 01:31:33.187
INSTALLED THE CHARGER CAN THEN

01:31:33.254 --> 01:31:34.255
REPORT THAT TO THE POLICE. THEY

01:31:34.322 --> 01:31:36.157
CAN GET THEY CAN TAKE OUT THEIR

01:31:36.224 --> 01:31:38.159
OWN INSURANCE. NOTHING'S

01:31:38.226 --> 01:31:38.993
STOPPING THEM FROM TAKING OUT

01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:39.760
THEIR OWN INSURANCE TO PROTECT

01:31:39.827 --> 01:31:41.929
AGAINST THEIR OWN LOSSES

01:31:41.996 --> 01:31:43.331
ASSOCIATED WITH WHAT YOU'RE

01:31:43.397 --> 01:31:45.967
DESCRIBING. SO IF THEY IF THEY

01:31:46.033 --> 01:31:47.969
WANT TO GO OUT AND FIND AN

01:31:48.035 --> 01:31:49.170
INSURANCE PRODUCT TO GUARD

01:31:49.237 --> 01:31:50.538
AGAINST OR PROTECT AGAINST THAT

01:31:50.605 --> 01:31:51.873
EXACT SCENARIO, THAT THAT'S

01:31:51.939 --> 01:31:54.175
THEIR OPTION. BUT THIS IS THE

01:31:54.242 --> 01:31:56.377
HOA WOULDN'T BE ON THE HOOK FOR

01:31:56.444 --> 01:32:00.114
A SUIT FROM THE FROM THE CAR

01:32:00.181 --> 01:32:02.650
OWNER FOR A THIRD PARTY

01:32:02.717 --> 01:32:06.721
VANDALIZING THE CHARGER. I MEAN,

01:32:06.787 --> 01:32:07.922
OBVIOUSLY, I MEAN, IF THE HOA

01:32:07.989 --> 01:32:09.690
WENT IN AND BANGED IT UP, YOU

01:32:09.757 --> 01:32:11.425
KNOW, BUT YOU KNOW, YOUR THE

01:32:11.492 --> 01:32:12.226
SCENARIO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:32:12.293 --> 01:32:13.761
DOESN'T REALLY INVOLVE THE HOA.

01:32:13.828 --> 01:32:14.762
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE? WELL, I'M

01:32:14.829 --> 01:32:17.265
JUST SAYING IF THE HOA COVERS

01:32:17.331 --> 01:32:18.633
LIKE THEIR IF THE HOA IS

01:32:18.699 --> 01:32:22.670
INSURANCE COVER, IF THEY WANT TO

01:32:22.737 --> 01:32:23.504
VANDALISM AND BUT BUT AGAIN

01:32:23.571 --> 01:32:26.540
AGAIN THAT WOULD BE THE HOA'S

01:32:26.607 --> 01:32:29.010
DISCRETION IF THEY IF THEY WANT

01:32:29.076 --> 01:32:31.279
TO COVER THAT SORT OF THING.

01:32:31.345 --> 01:32:32.713
WELL, ALL WE'RE DOING IS THIS IS

01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:34.181
A VERY PARTICULAR PART OF LAW

01:32:34.248 --> 01:32:39.754
THAT GOVERNS THE ACCESS OF EV,

01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:42.189
THE RIGHT OF, OF SOMEONE TO, TO

01:32:42.256 --> 01:32:43.658
INSTALL EV CHARGING

01:32:43.724 --> 01:32:46.227
INFRASTRUCTURE. BUT BUT IT'S

01:32:46.294 --> 01:32:48.596
MOVING THE INSURANCE TOWARDS THE

01:32:48.663 --> 01:32:50.464
HOA, THE, THE PERSONAL INSURANCE

01:32:50.531 --> 01:32:52.934
SIDE. THE CURRENT LAW REQUIRES

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.569
THE HOA TO BE INCLUDED AS AN

01:32:55.636 --> 01:32:57.838
ADDITIONAL INSURED. IF YOU WANT

01:32:57.905 --> 01:32:59.607
TO INSTALL THE CHARGER. AND

01:32:59.674 --> 01:33:01.108
WE'RE DOING WITH THIS BILL, WE

01:33:01.175 --> 01:33:02.476
SEEK TO DO AWAY WITH THAT

01:33:02.543 --> 01:33:04.578
EXPLICIT REQUIREMENT. DOES THAT

01:33:04.645 --> 01:33:06.380
MAKE SENSE? AND BUT THEN IT

01:33:06.447 --> 01:33:08.883
WOULD ONLY BE ON THE HOA, RIGHT?

01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:12.687
NO, NO. IF SOMEONE WERE TO IN

01:33:12.753 --> 01:33:14.755
YOUR SCENARIO RIGHT. SOMEONE

01:33:14.822 --> 01:33:16.157
COMES UP AND JUST LIKE

01:33:16.223 --> 01:33:20.161
SLEDGEHAMMERS THE ITEM. RIGHT.

01:33:20.227 --> 01:33:23.097
THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT THE HOA.

01:33:23.164 --> 01:33:24.098
THAT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE THE

01:33:24.165 --> 01:33:25.866
HOA KIND OF INSURANCE

01:33:25.933 --> 01:33:26.968
RESPONSIBILITY. NOW OF COURSE,

01:33:27.034 --> 01:33:28.502
IF THEY HAVE SOME SORT OF

01:33:28.569 --> 01:33:29.503
COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE, I

01:33:29.570 --> 01:33:32.239
SUPPOSE MAYBE THE MAYBE THE,

01:33:32.306 --> 01:33:33.975
THE, THE CAR OWNER COULD MAKE

01:33:34.041 --> 01:33:36.610
THE CASE. BUT BUT YEAH. SORRY

01:33:36.677 --> 01:33:37.745
MADAM CHAIR. YEAH, YEAH. SO

01:33:37.812 --> 01:33:40.047
UNDER THE HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS

01:33:40.114 --> 01:33:42.116
MASTER POLICY, ANYTHING IN THE

01:33:42.183 --> 01:33:44.418
COMMON AREA. SO MY UNDERSTANDING

01:33:44.485 --> 01:33:46.721
IS THAT IF THE ASSOCIATION WERE

01:33:46.787 --> 01:33:48.222
TO INSTALL EV CHARGERS FOR THE

01:33:48.289 --> 01:33:50.191
ENTIRE COMMUNITY, THEN YES, ANY

01:33:50.257 --> 01:33:52.259
TYPE OF VANDALISM OR ISSUE WOULD

01:33:52.326 --> 01:33:54.061
BE COVERED BY THAT. THIS BILL

01:33:54.128 --> 01:33:56.097
WOULD REMOVE. THAT IS MY

01:33:56.163 --> 01:33:58.399
UNDERSTANDING TO THE INDIVIDUAL.

01:33:58.466 --> 01:34:00.434
THE INDIVIDUAL IS INSTALLING AN

01:34:00.501 --> 01:34:02.636
EV CHARGER IN A COMMON AREA.

01:34:02.703 --> 01:34:04.138
REMOVING THE ASSOCIATION WOULD

01:34:04.205 --> 01:34:05.306
THEN, IF SOMETHING WERE TO

01:34:05.373 --> 01:34:07.708
HAPPEN TO THAT NØ EV CHARGER

01:34:07.775 --> 01:34:09.043
THAT'S ON THE ASSOCIATION THAT

01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:10.678
THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. IT

01:34:10.745 --> 01:34:12.446
WOULD REMOVE THE REQUIREMENT

01:34:12.513 --> 01:34:14.882
THAT THE HOA BE ADDED AS AN

01:34:14.949 --> 01:34:16.784
ADDITIONAL INSURED. IF A IF A IF

01:34:16.851 --> 01:34:18.486
A MEMBER OF THE OF THE

01:34:18.552 --> 01:34:19.653
ASSOCIATION WANTED TO INSTALL IT

01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:21.389
ON THEIR OWN. IF THE IF THE IF

01:34:21.455 --> 01:34:23.624
THE HOA WANTED TO GO AHEAD AND

01:34:23.691 --> 01:34:26.127
DO IT ON ITS OWN AND IT WANTED

01:34:26.193 --> 01:34:27.128
TO KEEP IT AS PART OF ITS

01:34:27.194 --> 01:34:28.129
BROADER INSURANCE POLICY,

01:34:28.195 --> 01:34:29.330
THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE THAT

01:34:29.397 --> 01:34:30.898
WOULD STOP THEM FROM DOING THAT.

01:34:30.965 --> 01:34:33.000
YEAH, OKAY. YOU KNOW. YEAH,

01:34:33.067 --> 01:34:34.802
YEAH, YEAH. ARE YOU FINISHED

01:34:34.869 --> 01:34:37.204
WITH YOUR QUESTION? ARE YOU

01:34:37.271 --> 01:34:38.172
FINISHED? I KNOW THIS IS TRICKY.

01:34:38.239 --> 01:34:41.442
IT'S VERY CONFUSING. THANK YOU

01:34:41.509 --> 01:34:43.044
FOR CLARITY. NO. IT'S GOOD. I

01:34:43.110 --> 01:34:44.979
THINK WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO

01:34:45.046 --> 01:34:45.746
CLARIFY YET FURTHER. NOTHING IN

01:34:45.813 --> 01:34:47.314
THIS BILL WOULD PREVENT AN HOA

01:34:47.381 --> 01:34:50.551
FROM SEEKING INDEMNITY FROM AN

01:34:50.618 --> 01:34:51.585
INDIVIDUAL'S CARRIER WHEN THAT

01:34:51.652 --> 01:34:52.953
INDIVIDUAL GETS THEIR INSURANCE.

01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:54.388
IN OTHER WORDS, YOU DON'T HAVE

01:34:54.455 --> 01:34:56.891
TO BE A NAMED INSURER IN ORDER

01:34:56.957 --> 01:34:57.658
TO GO TO THE PERSONALIZED

01:34:57.725 --> 01:34:59.026
HOMEOWNER AND SAY, WE NEED SOME

01:34:59.093 --> 01:35:00.995
INDEMNITY FROM YOUR CARRIER

01:35:01.062 --> 01:35:03.330
BECAUSE IN FACT, YOU MADE THE

01:35:03.397 --> 01:35:04.632
CORD TOO LONG, AND THAT'S WHY

01:35:04.698 --> 01:35:06.100
SOMEBODY TRIPPED AND IT REALLY

01:35:06.167 --> 01:35:08.002
WASN'T ON THE HOA TO MAINTAIN

01:35:08.069 --> 01:35:09.203
IT. IT WAS THE ACTUAL INDIVIDUAL

01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:11.038
HOMEOWNER. SO THE INDEMNITY IS

01:35:11.105 --> 01:35:12.440
STILL OUT THERE, EVEN THOUGH THE

01:35:12.506 --> 01:35:14.575
NAMED INSURED ISSUE, WHICH IS

01:35:14.642 --> 01:35:16.043
THE DIFFICULTY THAT HOMEOWNERS

01:35:16.110 --> 01:35:18.979
ARE HAVING THAT THAT PUT IN EV

01:35:19.046 --> 01:35:22.416
CHARGERS, THAT ISSUE IS THE

01:35:22.483 --> 01:35:24.385
PROBLEM. BUT ULTIMATE INDEMNITY

01:35:24.452 --> 01:35:26.120
NEVER GOES AWAY. THAT'S RIGHT,

01:35:26.187 --> 01:35:27.288
THAT'S RIGHT. OKAY. THAT'S

01:35:27.354 --> 01:35:29.256
RIGHT. THAT'S JUST WHAT I WANTED

01:35:29.323 --> 01:35:29.990
TO CLARIFY. SO WHATEVER THAT

01:35:30.057 --> 01:35:31.592
LIABILITY IS, IF IT'S YOU DIDN'T

01:35:31.659 --> 01:35:34.028
MAINTAIN A SAFE CONDITION OR

01:35:34.095 --> 01:35:35.563
WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE. YEAH, WE

01:35:35.629 --> 01:35:37.498
CAN ALWAYS GO AFTER THE OTHER

01:35:37.565 --> 01:35:38.099
CARRIER. AND CERTAINLY IF THE

01:35:38.165 --> 01:35:40.101
HOA WANTS TO PROVIDE A NO

01:35:40.167 --> 01:35:40.501
QUESTION CHARGING

01:35:40.568 --> 01:35:42.470
INFRASTRUCTURE, THEY CAN ADD IT

01:35:42.536 --> 01:35:43.471
TO THEIR INSURANCE POLICY, NO

01:35:43.537 --> 01:35:44.405
QUESTION. BUT THIS INDEMNITY

01:35:44.472 --> 01:35:46.307
FROM THE ACTUAL PERSON GETTING

01:35:46.373 --> 01:35:47.475
INSURANCE, WHO WILL BE GETTING

01:35:47.541 --> 01:35:49.243
INSURANCE, WHO WILL SAY, I PUT

01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:51.045
IN AN EV CHARGER AND I NEED TO

01:35:51.112 --> 01:35:52.379
GET THAT INSURED, RIGHT. THERE'S

01:35:52.446 --> 01:35:53.814
A DEEP POCKET THERE. SHOULD

01:35:53.881 --> 01:35:55.549
SHOULD THE HOA NEED IT. RIGHT.

01:35:55.616 --> 01:35:58.919
OKAY. ALL RIGHT. WE HAVE A FEW

01:35:58.986 --> 01:36:00.121
MORE QUESTIONS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S

01:36:00.187 --> 01:36:01.322
OVER. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

01:36:01.388 --> 01:36:03.390
BRINGING THIS BILL. I'D LOVE TO

01:36:03.457 --> 01:36:05.392
BE ADDED AS A COAUTHOR. I THINK

01:36:05.459 --> 01:36:06.560
IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT ONE TO

01:36:06.627 --> 01:36:07.561
HELP REMOVE BARRIERS THAT I

01:36:07.628 --> 01:36:09.196
THINK SO MANY PEOPLE ARE FACING

01:36:09.263 --> 01:36:11.065
AS THEY'RE TRYING TO NAVIGATE

01:36:11.132 --> 01:36:11.732
HOW THEY'RE GOING TO CHARGE

01:36:11.799 --> 01:36:14.001
THEIR CARS WHEN THEY GET HOME,

01:36:14.068 --> 01:36:14.635
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE LIVING

01:36:14.702 --> 01:36:17.171
IN IN MULTI-UNIT BUILDINGS. I

01:36:17.238 --> 01:36:20.407
HAD A QUESTION FOR THE OPPONENT.

01:36:20.474 --> 01:36:23.978
DOES IS IT YOUR POSITION THAT

01:36:24.044 --> 01:36:27.715
SOMEONE SHOULD HAVE TO TAKE GET

01:36:27.781 --> 01:36:29.083
INSURANCE ON THEIR OWN POLICY?

01:36:29.150 --> 01:36:31.285
IF THEY HAD A STORAGE UNIT NEXT

01:36:31.352 --> 01:36:33.821
TO THE NEXT TO THEIR PARKING

01:36:33.888 --> 01:36:35.623
SPOT? OR, I MEAN, IT JUST SEEMS

01:36:35.689 --> 01:36:37.057
LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS

01:36:37.124 --> 01:36:39.960
THAT PEOPLE DO IN A GARAGE AND

01:36:40.027 --> 01:36:40.794
THAT THEIR, YOU KNOW, THEIR

01:36:40.861 --> 01:36:42.163
STORAGE UNITS IN MANY APARTMENT

01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:43.931
BUILDINGS AND MANY CONDOMINIUMS,

01:36:43.998 --> 01:36:46.433
I'VE NEVER HEARD, WHICH PROBABLY

01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:48.135
CREATES SOME MINIMAL AMOUNT OF

01:36:48.202 --> 01:36:50.337
RISK. AND I SORT OF VIEW THIS AS

01:36:50.404 --> 01:36:52.139
SOMETHING WHERE THE CHARGER HAS

01:36:52.206 --> 01:36:55.009
REALLY MINIMAL RISK, SOMETHING

01:36:55.075 --> 01:36:56.610
WHERE WE WANT CHARGERS TO BE IN

01:36:56.677 --> 01:36:59.780
THESE PARKING SPACES, AND WHERE

01:36:59.847 --> 01:37:02.049
IT'S SORT OF AN ODD QUESTION TO

01:37:02.116 --> 01:37:04.118
GO TO AN INSURANCE COMPANY AND

01:37:04.185 --> 01:37:07.621
SAY, CAN I ADD AN ENTIRE CONDO

01:37:07.688 --> 01:37:09.223
ASSOCIATION ON BECAUSE I WANT TO

01:37:09.290 --> 01:37:11.692
PUT A CHARGER IN FOR MY CAR? IT

01:37:11.759 --> 01:37:12.593
WOULD BE LIKE COMING IN AND

01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:15.296
SAYING, OKAY, I USE A HOSE TO

01:37:15.362 --> 01:37:17.097
WASH MY CAR IN THE BUILDING, SO

01:37:17.164 --> 01:37:18.866
CAN YOU GIVE ME PUT THE CONDO

01:37:18.933 --> 01:37:21.402
ASSOCIATION ON BECAUSE I HAVE

01:37:21.468 --> 01:37:24.305
HOSES NEXT TO MY RIGHT, OR

01:37:24.371 --> 01:37:26.373
BECAUSE I HAVE A STORAGE UNIT

01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:28.475
NEXT TO IT? IT'S ALL THESE

01:37:28.542 --> 01:37:32.146
MODEST RISKS THAT ARE PART OF

01:37:32.213 --> 01:37:33.914
LIVING IN A MULTI-UNIT BUILDING.

01:37:33.981 --> 01:37:38.686
AND IT FEELS LIKE THIS IS BEING

01:37:38.752 --> 01:37:41.589
ISOLATED OUT WHEN AT LEAST IT'S

01:37:41.655 --> 01:37:43.390
THE PLAN IN THE STATE OF

01:37:43.457 --> 01:37:44.625
CALIFORNIA THAT MOST PEOPLE WILL

01:37:44.692 --> 01:37:45.793
BE CHARGING, WILL BE DRIVING

01:37:45.859 --> 01:37:47.228
ELECTRIC VEHICLES AT SOME POINT

01:37:47.294 --> 01:37:48.729
SOON, AND WE WANT TO ACCOMMODATE

01:37:48.796 --> 01:37:51.198
IT. I THINK WITH, YOU KNOW,

01:37:51.265 --> 01:37:53.634
FROM, YOU KNOW, SIMILAR TO THE

01:37:53.701 --> 01:37:56.203
COMMENTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE

01:37:56.270 --> 01:37:58.539
FROM PASADENA, YOU KNOW, IF THIS

01:37:58.606 --> 01:38:00.507
WAS SOMETHING WHERE THERE WAS

01:38:00.574 --> 01:38:02.376
SOME HUGE RISK INVOLVED, THAT

01:38:02.443 --> 01:38:03.644
WAS, YOU KNOW, THAT WAS

01:38:03.711 --> 01:38:04.845
IDENTIFIABLE AND UNDERSTANDABLE,

01:38:04.912 --> 01:38:06.714
I MIGHT HAVE A DIFFERENT

01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:07.781
PERSPECTIVE, BUT I JUST DON'T

01:38:07.848 --> 01:38:10.384
SEE ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE

01:38:10.451 --> 01:38:12.920
KINDS OF RISKS THAT LAWYERS SORT

01:38:12.987 --> 01:38:16.056
OF DREAM UP IN, IN THEIR OFFICES

01:38:16.123 --> 01:38:18.192
IN ORDER TO SORT OF ARGUE ABOUT

01:38:18.259 --> 01:38:20.194
HOW YOU CAN PREVENT SOMETHING

01:38:20.261 --> 01:38:21.395
FROM HAPPENING. SO WITH THAT, I

01:38:21.462 --> 01:38:23.030
DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO

01:38:23.097 --> 01:38:25.165
RESPOND TO THAT. I SAID A LOT,

01:38:25.232 --> 01:38:25.766
BUT, ASSEMBLYMEMBER, THANK YOU

01:38:25.833 --> 01:38:27.301
FOR THE QUESTION. I DON'T KNOW

01:38:27.368 --> 01:38:28.969
THE POLICIES FOR STORAGE UNITS.

01:38:29.036 --> 01:38:30.738
I'LL JUST SAY THAT EV CHARGERS

01:38:30.804 --> 01:38:32.539
ARE ALREADY BEING COVERED IN

01:38:32.606 --> 01:38:34.975
SOME POLICIES, SO I WOULD HAVE

01:38:35.042 --> 01:38:35.576
TO LOOK FURTHER INTO STORAGE

01:38:35.643 --> 01:38:38.112
UNITS OR HOSES. YEAH. ANYWAY,

01:38:38.178 --> 01:38:40.014
THANK YOU. I THINK IT'S A GOOD

01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:42.049
BILL. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT.

01:38:42.116 --> 01:38:43.317
AND I'LL BE SUPPORTING MEMBER,

01:38:43.384 --> 01:38:44.118
ASSEMBLY MEMBER PACHECO. THANK

01:38:44.184 --> 01:38:47.421
YOU. AND I KNOW A LOT OF THE

01:38:47.488 --> 01:38:48.022
QUESTIONS THAT WERE ACTUALLY

01:38:48.088 --> 01:38:49.390
ASKED ASKING ARE ACTUALLY LIKE

01:38:49.456 --> 01:38:50.524
INSURANCE TYPE OF RELATED

01:38:50.591 --> 01:38:52.192
QUESTIONS. AND I DO UNDERSTAND

01:38:52.259 --> 01:38:54.261
THAT THIS BILL IS GOING TO GO TO

01:38:54.328 --> 01:38:55.896
THE INSURANCE COMMITTEE NEXT.

01:38:55.963 --> 01:38:58.132
AND I'M SURE A LOT OF THESE

01:38:58.198 --> 01:39:00.668
ISSUES WILL BE RESOLVED IN THAT

01:39:00.734 --> 01:39:03.404
COMMITTEE. BUT IT DOESN'T. I'M

01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:05.072
READING THE ANALYSIS. IT DOESN'T

01:39:05.139 --> 01:39:07.808
LOOK LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE THE

01:39:07.875 --> 01:39:10.244
HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE CAN STILL

01:39:10.311 --> 01:39:12.479
RECOVER COMPENSATION. IS THAT

01:39:12.546 --> 01:39:14.481
CORRECT? OR COMPENSATION FOR ANY

01:39:14.548 --> 01:39:15.449
DAMAGES? THAT'S THE POINT THAT

01:39:15.516 --> 01:39:17.117
DIANE, WHICH IS YEAH. SO IT

01:39:17.184 --> 01:39:18.819
LOOKS LIKE THERE'S STILL AN

01:39:18.886 --> 01:39:20.954
ABILITY. BUT I UNDERSTAND

01:39:21.021 --> 01:39:23.624
THERE'S MAYBE CONCERNS. SO I'M

01:39:23.691 --> 01:39:25.392
LOOKING FORWARD TO CONVERSATIONS

01:39:25.459 --> 01:39:26.994
ON BOTH SIDES. BUT I'M SURE A

01:39:27.061 --> 01:39:29.496
LOT OF THESE CONCERNS WILL BE

01:39:29.563 --> 01:39:30.197
ADDRESSED IN INSURANCE. I AM

01:39:30.264 --> 01:39:32.566
VOTING FOR THE BILL TODAY, AND

01:39:32.633 --> 01:39:34.201
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO CONTINUED

01:39:34.268 --> 01:39:35.769
CONVERSATIONS AND SEEING WHAT

01:39:35.836 --> 01:39:37.304
COMES OUT OF COMMITTEE. SO I

01:39:37.371 --> 01:39:38.972
APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE AND

01:39:39.039 --> 01:39:41.575
ADDRESSING YOUR CONCERNS, AND

01:39:41.642 --> 01:39:43.310
HOPEFULLY WE COME OUT WITH

01:39:43.377 --> 01:39:45.346
SOMETHING GOOD. I KNOW A LOT OF

01:39:45.412 --> 01:39:47.614
A LOT OF US ARE GETTING ELECTRIC

01:39:47.681 --> 01:39:49.783
VEHICLES. I'M NOT THERE YET, BUT

01:39:49.850 --> 01:39:51.652
SOMEDAY I WILL BE. SO I

01:39:51.719 --> 01:39:53.821
APPRECIATE YOU COMING HERE.

01:39:53.887 --> 01:39:57.057
THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. DO WE HAVE

01:39:57.124 --> 01:39:58.726

THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SENATOR.

01:40:15.275 --> 01:40:16.777

BILL 436? YEAH. YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:40:57.050 --> 01:40:59.520
YOU GUYS MAKE THIS A VERY

01:40:59.586 --> 01:41:10.564
PLEASANT EXPERIENCE. WE TRY. ALL

01:41:10.631 --> 01:41:14.835
RIGHT? OKAY. PLEASE PROCEED.

01:41:14.902 --> 01:41:16.603
YEAH. DO YOU WANT OUR WITNESSES

01:41:16.670 --> 01:41:19.072
UP HERE? OR IF YOU HAVE ONE

01:41:19.139 --> 01:41:22.509
MORE, THAT'S SURE. DO WE HAVE

01:41:22.576 --> 01:41:27.047
ROOM? DO YOU HAVE ANY? YEAH.

01:41:27.114 --> 01:41:31.018
DON'T BE BASHFUL. AND IF THE

01:41:31.084 --> 01:41:34.655
OPPOSITION HAS, ONE OF YOU WILL

01:41:34.721 --> 01:41:42.129
STEP ASIDE. I MEAN. GOOD

01:41:42.196 --> 01:41:46.767
MORNING. ALL RIGHT. OKAY. PLEASE

01:41:46.834 --> 01:41:50.170
BEGIN. THANK YOU. I'M HERE TO

01:41:50.237 --> 01:41:52.940
PRESENT SB 436, WHICH IS A VERY

01:41:53.006 --> 01:41:55.142
SIMPLE BILL. IT BASICALLY

01:41:55.209 --> 01:41:56.944
EXTENDS THE PAYER MOVE OUT

01:41:57.010 --> 01:41:57.678
NOTICE FOR RESIDENTIAL RENTERS

01:41:57.744 --> 01:42:00.113
FROM THREE DAYS TO 14 DAYS. AND

01:42:00.180 --> 01:42:02.416
I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR, THERE'S

01:42:02.483 --> 01:42:04.184
ACTUALLY A NUMBER OF STATES WITH

01:42:04.251 --> 01:42:07.387
VARYING POLITICAL PARTY

01:42:07.454 --> 01:42:09.022
LEADERSHIP LIKE MASSACHUSETTS,

01:42:09.089 --> 01:42:11.725
NEW YORK, TENNESSEE, VERMONT,

01:42:11.792 --> 01:42:13.861
VIRGINIA, WASHINGTON AND OTHERS

01:42:13.927 --> 01:42:16.063
THAT ALL REQUIRE LANDLORDS TO

01:42:16.129 --> 01:42:18.599
PROVIDE A MINIMUM OF 14 DAY

01:42:18.665 --> 01:42:19.967
NOTICE BEFORE TERMINATING A

01:42:20.033 --> 01:42:22.736
TENANCY FOR NONPAYMENT. AND I

01:42:22.803 --> 01:42:25.172
WANT TO MAKE IT ALSO VERY CLEAR

01:42:25.239 --> 01:42:27.307
THAT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS

01:42:27.374 --> 01:42:28.842
AND SENATE JUDICIARY WERE DONE

01:42:28.909 --> 01:42:31.311
TO THE BENEFIT OF LANDLORDS AND

01:42:31.378 --> 01:42:32.179
TENANTS, GIVING TENANTS MORE

01:42:32.246 --> 01:42:35.015
TIME TO MAKE GOOD ON THEIR RENT

01:42:35.082 --> 01:42:36.183
REDUCES THE LIKELIHOOD OF

01:42:36.250 --> 01:42:38.719
LANDLORDS INCURRING COURT COSTS.

01:42:38.785 --> 01:42:40.387
THERE'S A NUMBER OF BENEFITS,

01:42:40.454 --> 01:42:41.989
YOU KNOW. FOR EXAMPLE, UNDER

01:42:42.055 --> 01:42:43.290
CURRENT LAW, TENANTS MAY AVOID

01:42:43.357 --> 01:42:44.725
EVICTION FOR NONPAYMENT OF RENT

01:42:44.791 --> 01:42:46.326
ONLY IF THEY ARE ABLE TO PAY ALL

01:42:46.393 --> 01:42:47.728
OF THEIR RENT DEMANDED BY THE

01:42:47.794 --> 01:42:49.763
LANDLORD WITHIN THREE DAYS OF A

01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:52.699
NOTICE TO PAY OR QUIT. BUT THE

01:42:52.766 --> 01:42:54.167
REALITY IS THAT ONCE THE SUN HAS

01:42:54.234 --> 01:42:55.702
SET ON THE THIRD BUSINESS DAY,

01:42:55.769 --> 01:42:57.037
THE TENANT'S RIGHT TO PRESERVE

01:42:57.104 --> 01:42:59.106
THE TENANCY AND AVOID EVICTION

01:42:59.172 --> 01:43:00.541
IS COMPLETELY EXTINGUISHED. THE

01:43:00.607 --> 01:43:02.376
STATE'S THREE DAY NOTICE PASSES

01:43:02.442 --> 01:43:03.777
FAR TOO QUICKLY FOR FAMILIES TO

01:43:03.844 --> 01:43:05.979
MAKE UP PAST DUE RENT OR RECEIVE

01:43:06.046 --> 01:43:07.881
FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. BEYOND

01:43:07.948 --> 01:43:09.182
IMMEDIATE DISPLACEMENT, THE

01:43:09.249 --> 01:43:10.384
NEGATIVE RIPPLE EFFECTS OF

01:43:10.450 --> 01:43:12.286
EVICTION OFTEN EXTEND TO THE

01:43:12.352 --> 01:43:14.221
LOSS OF POSSESSIONS, ACCESS TO

01:43:14.288 --> 01:43:16.723
WORK, HEALTH CARE, AND

01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:17.991
TRANSPORTATION. I ALSO WANT TO

01:43:18.058 --> 01:43:19.059
HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT WHEN YOU

01:43:19.126 --> 01:43:22.930
ARE A FORECLOSED ON, IT TAKES

01:43:22.996 --> 01:43:25.032
SEVERAL MONTHS TO HAVE A

01:43:25.098 --> 01:43:27.301
PROPERTY FORECLOSED ON. WE'VE

01:43:27.367 --> 01:43:29.202
CHANGED THE LAWS ALSO FOR

01:43:29.269 --> 01:43:31.638
FORECLOSURE AND THE NOTICE TO

01:43:31.705 --> 01:43:33.740
VACATE FOR HOMEOWNERS DURING THE

01:43:33.807 --> 01:43:35.576
GREAT RECESSION. BUT WE DID NOT

01:43:35.642 --> 01:43:37.578
DO THAT FOR RENTERS. IN FACT,

01:43:37.644 --> 01:43:39.212
THERE ARE MANY CITIES THAT

01:43:39.279 --> 01:43:41.815
PROVIDE RENTAL ASSISTANCE TO

01:43:41.882 --> 01:43:43.817
ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE HOUSED

01:43:43.884 --> 01:43:45.619
LONGER. RIGHT? THAT IS THE GOAL.

01:43:45.686 --> 01:43:47.487
WE TALK CONSTANTLY ABOUT THE

01:43:47.554 --> 01:43:49.590
FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE PAYCHECK TO

01:43:49.656 --> 01:43:53.126
PAYCHECK AND OUR FASTEST GROWING

01:43:53.193 --> 01:43:55.228
HOMELESS DEMOGRAPHIC IS OUR

01:43:55.295 --> 01:43:58.265
SENIORS, OUR SENIORS, THOSE THAT

01:43:58.332 --> 01:44:01.935
ARE PAST THEIR PRIME EARNING AGE

01:44:02.002 --> 01:44:03.537
AND ARE LITERALLY LIVING

01:44:03.604 --> 01:44:05.272
PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. WHEN WE

01:44:05.339 --> 01:44:07.674
HAVE THESE CONCERNS ABOUT, YOU

01:44:07.741 --> 01:44:09.509
KNOW, OUR SENIOR POPULATION, OUR

01:44:09.576 --> 01:44:10.911
GROWING HOMELESS POPULATION AND

01:44:10.978 --> 01:44:13.614
MUCH MORE. YES, THERE'S A LOT OF

01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:14.715
THINGS THAT THE STATE OF

01:44:14.781 --> 01:44:16.583
CALIFORNIA CAN DO AND SHOULD DO

01:44:16.650 --> 01:44:19.119
AND STILL DON'T DO. AND SO THIS

01:44:19.186 --> 01:44:22.222
IS A VERY SMALL ASK FROM THE

01:44:22.289 --> 01:44:25.525
STATE OF CALIFORNIA, VERY SMALL,

01:44:25.592 --> 01:44:27.928
TO ALLOW PEOPLE 14 DAYS TO

01:44:27.995 --> 01:44:29.129
EITHER ASK FOR FAMILY MEMBERS

01:44:29.196 --> 01:44:31.298
AND LOVED ONES TO GIVE THEM

01:44:31.365 --> 01:44:34.234
MONEY, TO STAY HOUSED, TO ASK

01:44:34.301 --> 01:44:36.269
THEIR CITIES OR ANY OF THE OTHER

01:44:36.336 --> 01:44:37.504
NONPROFITS THAT HELP PEOPLE WITH

01:44:37.571 --> 01:44:40.607
RENTAL ASSISTANCE STAY HOUSED,

01:44:40.674 --> 01:44:43.977
OR TO EVEN BE ABLE TO WAIT FOR

01:44:44.044 --> 01:44:44.778
THEIR CHECK. IMAGINE YOU BEING

01:44:44.845 --> 01:44:47.514
IN A HOSPITAL AND UNABLE TO

01:44:47.581 --> 01:44:49.383
ACTUALLY EARN ANY INCOME FOR

01:44:49.449 --> 01:44:51.485
THAT MOMENT, AND OR WAITING FOR

01:44:51.551 --> 01:44:53.654
YOUR CHECK. SO WHEN WE TALK

01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:55.522
ABOUT PEOPLE LIVING PAYCHECK TO

01:44:55.589 --> 01:44:57.724
PAYCHECK, WELL, WE CAN DO

01:44:57.791 --> 01:44:58.325
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT AND KEEP

01:44:58.392 --> 01:45:00.927
PEOPLE HOUSED LONGER. TODAY,

01:45:00.994 --> 01:45:02.429
EXTENDING THE NOTICE PERIOD TO

01:45:02.496 --> 01:45:03.997
14 DAYS ALLOWS A TENANT MORE

01:45:04.064 --> 01:45:05.799
TIME TO PAY BEFORE BEING TAKEN

01:45:05.866 --> 01:45:07.300
TO COURT. IT ALSO ALLOWS

01:45:07.367 --> 01:45:09.436
SOMEBODY TO AVOID AN EVICTION

01:45:09.503 --> 01:45:12.039
RECORD AND, YOU KNOW, MAKE SURE

01:45:12.105 --> 01:45:14.174
THAT THEY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO

01:45:14.241 --> 01:45:15.976
RENT IN THE FUTURE OR FIND

01:45:16.043 --> 01:45:17.477
SOMEWHERE ELSE THAT'S CHEAPER TO

01:45:17.544 --> 01:45:19.913
LIVE. IT'S IN THE PUBLIC'S BEST

01:45:19.980 --> 01:45:20.947
INTEREST TO SOLVE THE ISSUE OF

01:45:21.014 --> 01:45:21.915
HOMELESSNESS BY REDUCING

01:45:21.982 --> 01:45:24.518
UNNECESSARY EVICTIONS. BOTH MY

01:45:24.584 --> 01:45:25.752
COUNTIES THAT I REPRESENT HAVE

01:45:25.819 --> 01:45:27.788
THE HIGHEST AMOUNT OF EVICTIONS

01:45:27.854 --> 01:45:29.156
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND

01:45:29.222 --> 01:45:30.691
IN FACT, THIS PAST FRIDAY, I

01:45:30.757 --> 01:45:32.793
WENT TO A FACILITY THAT CATERS

01:45:32.859 --> 01:45:34.428
LARGELY TO SENIORS, AND THEY

01:45:34.494 --> 01:45:37.164
WERE LIVING IN IN A 2020

01:45:37.230 --> 01:45:38.932
DEVELOPED BUILDING WITH

01:45:38.999 --> 01:45:40.333
LITERALLY STUDS. PEOPLE ARE

01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:42.602
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF COMMUNITIES.

01:45:42.669 --> 01:45:46.173
IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY, 75,312

01:45:46.239 --> 01:45:47.708
PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING

01:45:47.774 --> 01:45:49.042
HOMELESSNESS, 40% OF THE

01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:50.911
HOMELESS POPULATION HAVE A

01:45:50.977 --> 01:45:53.714
DISABLING CONDITION. 54% OF

01:45:53.780 --> 01:45:55.982
NEWLY HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS IN LA

01:45:56.049 --> 01:45:57.350
COUNTY BECOME HOMELESS DUE TO

01:45:57.417 --> 01:45:59.886
ECONOMIC HARDSHIP. IN SAN MATEO

NUMBER OF FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN

01:46:05.358 --> 01:46:06.359
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS HAS

01:46:06.426 --> 01:46:11.898
INCREASED BY OVER 50% FROM 2022

01:46:11.965 --> 01:46:14.234
TO 2024. THESE HOUSEHOLDS ARE

01:46:14.301 --> 01:46:15.669
PREDOMINANTLY FEMALE WOMEN AND

01:46:15.736 --> 01:46:16.770
CHILDREN BEING FORCED INTO THE

01:46:16.837 --> 01:46:18.605
STREETS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T

01:46:18.672 --> 01:46:19.940
AFFORD RENT. IN SAN MATEO

01:46:20.006 --> 01:46:23.944
COUNTY, SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY,

LAST POINT IN TIME COUNT ARE

01:46:35.655 --> 01:46:38.325
FROM SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY, NOT

01:46:38.391 --> 01:46:40.127
TRANSPLANTS. PEOPLE ARE MADE

01:46:40.193 --> 01:46:42.329
HOMELESS WHERE THEY LIVE IN

01:46:42.395 --> 01:46:45.265
ORANGE COUNTY, 7322 HOMELESS

01:46:45.332 --> 01:46:47.100
PEOPLE, WITH ONE THIRD OF THE

01:46:47.167 --> 01:46:48.435
HOMELESS POPULATION IN ORANGE

01:46:48.502 --> 01:46:51.371
COUNTY HAVING A DISABILITY. 76%

01:46:51.438 --> 01:46:52.339
REPORTED THAT THEIR LAST

01:46:52.405 --> 01:46:53.940
PERMANENT ADDRESS WAS IN ORANGE

01:46:54.007 --> 01:46:56.643
COUNTY, AND 51% HAVE FAMILY IN

01:46:56.710 --> 01:46:59.913
THE SAME COUNTY. LITERALLY EVERY

01:46:59.980 --> 01:47:01.414
SINGLE COUNTY THAT WE HAVE

01:47:01.481 --> 01:47:04.317
TALKED ABOUT, THE NUMBER ONE

01:47:04.384 --> 01:47:05.519
CONSIDERATION THAT MANY OF THEM

01:47:05.585 --> 01:47:06.787
HAVE RESPONDED TO IN THESE

01:47:06.853 --> 01:47:09.089
SURVEYS IS TO SAY THAT IF THEY

01:47:09.156 --> 01:47:10.857
WERE ABLE TO STAY HOUSED LONGER,

01:47:10.924 --> 01:47:12.192
THEY WOULD HAVE AVOIDED

01:47:12.259 --> 01:47:14.060
HOMELESSNESS COMPLETELY. IT IS

01:47:14.127 --> 01:47:15.462
RENTAL ASSISTANCE THAT HELPS

01:47:15.529 --> 01:47:17.297
THEM. MANY OF THEM NEED A LITTLE

01:47:17.364 --> 01:47:18.799
BIT MORE TIME TO DO THE

01:47:18.865 --> 01:47:20.100
PAPERWORK THAT THE NONPROFITS

01:47:20.167 --> 01:47:21.601
REQUIRE, THE PAPERWORK THAT THE

01:47:21.668 --> 01:47:23.570
CITIES REQUIRE TO STAY HOUSED.

01:47:23.637 --> 01:47:25.172
AND I WILL SAY THIS BENEFITS

01:47:25.238 --> 01:47:27.674
LANDLORDS COMPLETELY. THEY HAVE

01:47:27.741 --> 01:47:29.242
MONTHS IF THEY ARE DEALING WITH

01:47:29.309 --> 01:47:31.311
A FORECLOSURE TO DEAL WITH THEIR

01:47:31.378 --> 01:47:33.480
FORECLOSURE. BUT TENANTS HAVE

01:47:33.547 --> 01:47:34.981
THREE DAYS, A NOTICE OF THREE

01:47:35.048 --> 01:47:37.450
DAYS TO GET YOUR AND GET OUT.

01:47:37.517 --> 01:47:39.553
THAT'S LITERALLY WHAT IT IS. SO

01:47:39.619 --> 01:47:41.788
IF WE CARE ABOUT HOMELESS

01:47:41.855 --> 01:47:44.224
PEOPLE, IF WE CARE ABOUT

01:47:44.291 --> 01:47:46.293
SENIORS, IF WE CARE ABOUT SINGLE

01:47:46.359 --> 01:47:48.195
PARENTS AND CHILDREN ON THE

01:47:48.261 --> 01:47:50.730
STREETS, YOU WILL VOTE FOR THIS

01:47:50.797 --> 01:47:52.532
AND UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS

01:47:52.599 --> 01:47:54.601
LITERALLY BALANCING THE SCALES

01:47:54.668 --> 01:47:57.938
AND NOT TO THE DEGREE THAT IT

01:47:58.004 --> 01:47:58.705
NEEDS TO BE BALANCED. SO WITH

01:47:58.772 --> 01:48:00.373
THAT, I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE MY

01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:01.908

CO-SPONSOR OF SB 436, EXTENDING

THE THREE DAY NOTICE TO PAY RENT

01:48:32.606 --> 01:48:34.741
OR MOVE OUT TO 14 DAYS WOULD

01:48:34.808 --> 01:48:36.509
HELP TO SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASE

01:48:36.576 --> 01:48:38.211
EVICTIONS AMONG LOW INCOME

01:48:38.278 --> 01:48:39.779
RENTERS, DISPROPORTIONATELY MADE

01:48:39.846 --> 01:48:40.947

01:48:41.014 --> 01:48:43.617

01:48:43.683 --> 01:48:44.784
CALIFORNIA LAW, CALIFORNIA

01:48:44.851 --> 01:48:46.186
RENTERS RECEIVE ONLY THREE DAYS

01:48:46.253 --> 01:48:47.554
TO PAY BEFORE THE LANDLORD CAN

01:48:47.621 --> 01:48:49.322
BEGIN THE FAST TRACK EVICTION

01:48:49.389 --> 01:48:50.457
COURT PROCESS TO FORCE THEM FROM

01:48:50.523 --> 01:48:52.659
THEIR HOME. MANY LOW INCOME

01:48:52.726 --> 01:48:54.461
FAMILIES DO NOT HAVE SAVINGS,

01:48:54.527 --> 01:48:56.730
AND SO A SINGLE UNEXPECTED

01:48:56.796 --> 01:48:59.165
EXPENSE CAN LEAD TO A LATE RENT

01:48:59.232 --> 01:49:00.200
PAYMENT. SB 436 WOULD GIVE

01:49:00.267 --> 01:49:01.701
RENTERS WITH NO OTHER HOUSING

01:49:01.768 --> 01:49:03.436
OPTIONS ADDITIONAL TIME TO GET

01:49:03.503 --> 01:49:05.939
HELP TO PAY AND STAY IN THEIR

01:49:06.006 --> 01:49:07.340

01:49:07.407 --> 01:49:10.944
WITH OVER 30%, WITH OVER HALF OF

01:49:11.011 --> 01:49:12.612
RENTERS SPENDING MORE THAN 30%

01:49:12.679 --> 01:49:14.514
OF THEIR INCOME ON HOUSING,

01:49:14.581 --> 01:49:15.482

01:49:15.548 --> 01:49:17.784
THEY CAN GET TO STAY STABLY

01:49:17.851 --> 01:49:18.885
HOUSED. THE EXTRA DAYS GIVE

01:49:18.952 --> 01:49:21.388
RENTERS TIME TO ACCESS PUBLIC

01:49:21.454 --> 01:49:22.789

PAYCHECK, SECURE A LOAN OR FIND

01:49:26.226 --> 01:49:28.962
A LAWYER AND AVOID EVICTION. 14

01:49:29.029 --> 01:49:30.463
DAYS IS REASONABLE, ESPECIALLY

01:49:30.530 --> 01:49:32.232
GIVEN THAT RENTERS HAVE NO RIGHT

01:49:32.299 --> 01:49:33.633
TO CURE BEYOND THIS INITIAL

01:49:33.700 --> 01:49:34.768
NOTICE PERIOD, AND WE KNOW IT

01:49:34.834 --> 01:49:36.136
WORKS IN OTHER STATES THAT

01:49:36.202 --> 01:49:38.505
REQUIRE 14 DAY NOTICE. EXTENDING

01:49:38.571 --> 01:49:39.806
THE NOTICE PERIOD WOULD ALSO

01:49:39.873 --> 01:49:42.008
ALLOW BOTH PARTIES TO AVOID THE

01:49:42.075 --> 01:49:42.709
EXPENSE OF AN UNNECESSARY

01:49:42.776 --> 01:49:44.844
EVICTION. WHEN THE TENANCY COULD

01:49:44.911 --> 01:49:45.578
BE RESCUED WITH JUST A FEW EXTRA

01:49:45.645 --> 01:49:49.149
DAYS TO PAY. SB 436 IS A

01:49:49.215 --> 01:49:51.251
HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION BILL. A

01:49:51.318 --> 01:49:52.852
2018 STUDY BY THE NATIONAL LAW

CENTER ON HOMELESSNESS AND

01:49:54.220 --> 01:49:55.588
POVERTY FOUND THAT EVICTIONS ARE

01:49:55.655 --> 01:49:57.857
A DIRECT CAUSE OF HOMELESSNESS,

01:49:57.924 --> 01:49:59.426
EITHER IMMEDIATELY OR AFTER

01:49:59.492 --> 01:50:01.094
SOCIAL SAFETY NETWORKS ARE

01:50:01.161 --> 01:50:03.229
EXHAUSTED. AS WE STRUGGLE WITH

01:50:03.296 --> 01:50:05.165
THE HIGHEST RATE OF UNSHELTERED

01:50:05.231 --> 01:50:06.366
HOMELESSNESS IN THE NATION. AT A

01:50:06.433 --> 01:50:08.268
TIME WHEN EVICTION FILINGS HAVE

01:50:08.335 --> 01:50:10.036
SURPASSED PRE-PANDEMIC LEVELS

01:50:10.103 --> 01:50:11.838
AND RISING RENTS ARE OUTPACING

01:50:11.905 --> 01:50:14.874
WAGES, WE MUST DO ALL WE CAN TO

01:50:14.941 --> 01:50:16.242
STABILIZE HOUSING. FOR THE 45%

01:50:16.309 --> 01:50:17.644
OF CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS ACROSS

01:50:17.711 --> 01:50:19.379
THE STATE WHO RENT. FOR ALL

01:50:19.446 --> 01:50:21.548
THESE REASONS, ON BEHALF OF THE

01:50:21.614 --> 01:50:23.183
SPONSORS AND MORE THAN 90

01:50:23.249 --> 01:50:24.951

GOOD. CAN YOU HEAR ME? GOOD

01:50:31.458 --> 01:50:32.792
MORNING, CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AS

01:50:32.859 --> 01:50:34.194
THE SENATOR SAID, I'M JULIET

01:50:34.260 --> 01:50:35.762
BRODY. I'M A PROFESSOR AT

01:50:35.829 --> 01:50:36.629
STANFORD LAW SCHOOL, WHERE I

01:50:36.696 --> 01:50:38.932
DIRECT THE COMMUNITY LAW CLINIC,

01:50:38.999 --> 01:50:41.267
AND I HAVE SUPERVISED STUDENTS

01:50:41.334 --> 01:50:42.869
AND MYSELF REPRESENTED THOUSANDS

01:50:42.936 --> 01:50:45.071
OF TENANTS WHO ARE BEING

01:50:45.138 --> 01:50:46.106
EVICTED, MOST OF THEM FOR

01:50:46.172 --> 01:50:47.807
NONPAYMENT OF RENT, PRINCIPALLY

01:50:47.874 --> 01:50:50.076
IN SAN MATEO COUNTY. I'M NOT

01:50:50.143 --> 01:50:52.178
GOING TO REITERATE THE MAJOR

01:50:52.245 --> 01:50:54.247
POINTS OF THIS BILL, BUT THE

01:50:54.314 --> 01:50:55.215
RATIONALES FOR THIS BILL. BUT I

01:50:55.281 --> 01:50:57.984
DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE A FEW

01:50:58.051 --> 01:51:00.120
THINGS. NUMBER ONE, I'VE THE

01:51:00.186 --> 01:51:01.221
OPPOSITION WILL TELL YOU THAT

01:51:01.287 --> 01:51:04.090
THIS GOES WAY TOO FAR AND PUTS

01:51:04.157 --> 01:51:05.492
LANDLORDS BEHIND THE EIGHT BALL

01:51:05.558 --> 01:51:07.761
IN A SORT OF UNREASONABLE WAY.

01:51:07.827 --> 01:51:08.428
AND I WANT TO ADDRESS THAT HEAD

01:51:08.495 --> 01:51:11.398
ON. FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO SAY

01:51:11.464 --> 01:51:12.832
RENT WILL STILL BE DUE ON THE

01:51:12.899 --> 01:51:14.434
FIRST OR WHATEVER DATE THE LEASE

01:51:14.501 --> 01:51:16.736
SAYS THE RENT IS DUE, SO THIS

01:51:16.803 --> 01:51:18.471
DOES NOT CHANGE THE TERMS OF THE

01:51:18.538 --> 01:51:20.974
LEASE IT DOES GIVE AS HOMEOWNERS

01:51:21.041 --> 01:51:22.842
HAVE SOME FORGIVENESS IN TERMS

01:51:22.909 --> 01:51:24.944
OF DELINQUENCY AND DEFAULT, BUT

01:51:25.011 --> 01:51:26.813
RENT IS STILL DUE AND LATE FEES

01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:28.782
WILL STILL ATTACH IF THEY'RE

01:51:28.848 --> 01:51:30.750
CALLED FOR UNDER THE LEASE AS OF

01:51:30.817 --> 01:51:33.219
ANY LATE PAYMENT, SO WILL ANY

01:51:33.286 --> 01:51:35.455
OTHER DAMAGES TO THE LANDLORD

01:51:35.522 --> 01:51:36.689
ATTRIBUTABLE TO LATENESS.

01:51:36.756 --> 01:51:38.258
THEY'RE NOT WAIVING A CAUSE OF

01:51:38.324 --> 01:51:39.759
ACTION, THEY'RE JUST NOT ABLE TO

01:51:39.826 --> 01:51:41.861
TERMINATE A TENANCY AND PROCEED

01:51:41.928 --> 01:51:44.030
TO SUMMARY PROCESS IMMEDIATELY.

01:51:44.097 --> 01:51:46.232
THEY'RE JUST HAVING TO GIVE THE

01:51:46.299 --> 01:51:48.034
TENANTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CURE

01:51:48.101 --> 01:51:49.402
THAT. HOMEOWNERS AND WE ALL

01:51:49.469 --> 01:51:51.938
ENJOY. AND OTHER BILL PAYING

01:51:52.005 --> 01:51:54.040
CONTEXT. SIMILARLY, CHRONIC

01:51:54.107 --> 01:51:55.708
NONPAYMENT OF RENT COULD STILL

01:51:55.775 --> 01:51:58.378
BE A BASIS FOR EVICTION. SO THE

01:51:58.445 --> 01:52:00.246
SCENARIO THAT LANDLORDS WILL

01:52:00.313 --> 01:52:01.681
TELL YOU THAT SOMEONE CAN JUST

01:52:01.748 --> 01:52:04.517
NOW PAY RENT EVERY MONTH ON THE

01:52:04.584 --> 01:52:06.352
15TH WITHOUT PENALTY IS NOT

01:52:06.419 --> 01:52:08.822
TRUE. THERE'S ALWAYS A BALANCE.

01:52:08.888 --> 01:52:11.424
THAT'S WHAT YOU ALL DO. YOU HAVE

01:52:11.491 --> 01:52:12.092
TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN

01:52:12.158 --> 01:52:13.927
INTERESTS. THREE DAYS. THERE'S

01:52:13.993 --> 01:52:15.495
NO REASON TO THINK THAT THREE

01:52:15.562 --> 01:52:17.897
DAYS IS MAGIC AND CORRECT. THREE

01:52:17.964 --> 01:52:21.768
DAYS WAS SET IN 1863 AND HAS NOT

01:52:21.835 --> 01:52:24.938
CHANGED SINCE. 14 IS NOT MAGIC

01:52:25.004 --> 01:52:26.473
EITHER. THE STATES THE SENATOR

01:52:26.539 --> 01:52:28.608
LISTED HAVE 14 OR MORE. THERE

01:52:28.675 --> 01:52:30.510
ARE STATES THAT HAVE MORE. YOU

01:52:30.577 --> 01:52:32.579
ALL HAVE TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE.

01:52:32.645 --> 01:52:34.080
THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK THAT

01:52:34.147 --> 01:52:37.383
THREE IS RIGHT. MAKE IT AT LEAST

01:52:37.450 --> 01:52:38.618
14. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. THANK

01:52:38.685 --> 01:52:40.553
YOU VERY MUCH. LET'S SPEAK TO

01:52:40.620 --> 01:52:44.124
THE OPPOSITION. ANYONE Ó OTHER

THANKS. ZUBIATE. GOOD MORNING,

01:55:13.506 --> 01:55:15.642
MR. CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS,

DEBORAH CARLTON WITH THE

01:55:16.876 --> 01:55:18.811
CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION

01:55:18.878 --> 01:55:21.347
HERE IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION.

01:55:21.414 --> 01:55:23.182
THIS BILL WILL ALLOW FOR ALL

01:55:23.249 --> 01:55:25.151
TENANTS TO PAY ON THE 14TH,

01:55:25.218 --> 01:55:27.587
DESPITE THEIR FINANCIAL NEED.

01:55:27.654 --> 01:55:29.255
OWNERS WILL HAVE TO SERVE ALL OF

01:55:29.322 --> 01:55:31.591
THESE TENANTS WITH A 14 DAY

01:55:31.658 --> 01:55:33.026
NOTICE. CHRONIC NONPAYMENT IS

01:55:33.092 --> 01:55:35.528
NOT ADDRESSED DESPITE THE

01:55:35.595 --> 01:55:38.398
SUPPORTERS COMMENTS. RENTAL

01:55:38.464 --> 01:55:39.499
PROPERTY OWNERS, OF COURSE,

01:55:39.565 --> 01:55:40.633
STILL HAVE TO PAY THEIR BILLS,

01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:43.169
THE MORTGAGE, THE INSURANCE,

01:55:43.236 --> 01:55:45.905
ETC. YOU'VE HEARD THAT OTHER

01:55:45.972 --> 01:55:48.141
STATES HAVE LONGER NOTICE. WHAT

01:55:48.207 --> 01:55:49.642
YOU DIDN'T HEAR, HOWEVER, IS

01:55:49.709 --> 01:55:51.911
THOSE OTHER STATES HAVE VERY

01:55:51.978 --> 01:55:53.479
STRONG DISINCENTIVES TO PAYING

01:55:53.546 --> 01:55:57.116
LATE. SOME ARE A 5% PER WEEK,

01:55:57.183 --> 01:56:00.186
SOME ARE A 20% OF THE RENT. IF

01:56:00.253 --> 01:56:01.487
IT IS NOT PAID, ALL OF THOSE

01:56:01.554 --> 01:56:03.256
THAT ARE LISTED HAVE THOSE

01:56:03.323 --> 01:56:05.124
STRONG DISINCENTIVES. THIS BILL

01:56:05.191 --> 01:56:08.294
DOES NOT. THE SUPPORTERS ALSO

01:56:08.361 --> 01:56:09.529
ARGUE THAT THE LANDLORD CAN

01:56:09.595 --> 01:56:11.164
CHARGE ANY LATE FEE. THIS IS

01:56:11.230 --> 01:56:13.099
JUST NOT TRUE. WHILE CALIFORNIA

01:56:13.166 --> 01:56:15.168
DOES NOT HAVE A SPECIFIC LATE

01:56:15.234 --> 01:56:17.970
FEE LAW, THE COURTS HAVE UPHELD

01:56:18.037 --> 01:56:19.806
ONLY THOSE LATE FEES THAT THEY

01:56:19.872 --> 01:56:21.908
CONSIDER TO BE UNREASONABLE, AND

01:56:21.974 --> 01:56:24.344
THAT HAS BEEN VERY INCONSISTENT.

01:56:24.410 --> 01:56:26.646
THE AMOUNT OF LATE FEE THAT WE

01:56:26.713 --> 01:56:28.715
HAVE SEEN IS TYPICALLY $25,

01:56:28.781 --> 01:56:30.683
WHICH OF COURSE, AS YOU CAN

01:56:30.750 --> 01:56:32.852
GUESS, DOES NOT PROVIDE A

01:56:32.919 --> 01:56:34.487
DISINCENTIVE TO PAY THEIR RENT

01:56:34.554 --> 01:56:36.189
ON TIME. IF TENANTS CANNOT PAY

01:56:36.255 --> 01:56:38.257
THEIR RENT ON TIME, THERE ARE

01:56:38.324 --> 01:56:39.659
LOCAL PROGRAMS THAT HELP PAY THE

01:56:39.726 --> 01:56:41.761
RENT. BANKS ALSO PROVIDE

01:56:41.828 --> 01:56:43.563
INTEREST FREE CREDIT CARDS

01:56:43.629 --> 01:56:45.431
IMMEDIATELY TO ANYBODY WHO NEEDS

01:56:45.498 --> 01:56:46.532
TO PAY, AND THOSE CREDIT CARDS

01:56:46.599 --> 01:56:48.668
PAY THE LANDLORD DIRECTLY. IF

01:56:48.735 --> 01:56:50.737
THE STATE DOES CARE, AS THE GOOD

01:56:50.803 --> 01:56:53.005
SENATOR HAS SAID, THEN WE HAVE

01:56:53.072 --> 01:56:53.840
SUGGESTED THAT THEY PROVIDE A

01:56:53.906 --> 01:56:55.041
LOAN PROGRAM THROUGH THE EYE

01:56:55.108 --> 01:56:57.176
BANK IF THEY CARE. THAT'S WHAT

01:56:57.243 --> 01:56:59.746
THE STATE SHOULD DO. OF COURSE,

01:56:59.812 --> 01:57:02.215
THROUGH CURRENT LEASES, YOU HAVE

01:57:02.281 --> 01:57:06.953
TYPICALLY A 3 TO 5 DAY DELAY.

01:57:07.019 --> 01:57:09.288
BUT OF COURSE NOW THE OWNERS ARE

01:57:09.355 --> 01:57:11.290
GOING TO ROLL THAT BACK BECAUSE

01:57:11.357 --> 01:57:12.692
OF COURSE WE WILL END UP WITH

01:57:12.759 --> 01:57:14.193
OTHER BILLS THAT ARE PENDING AS

01:57:14.260 --> 01:57:16.629
WELL. WE'RE GOING TO END UP WITH

01:57:16.696 --> 01:57:18.164
22 DAYS, NOT 14 DAYS. SO WITH

01:57:18.231 --> 01:57:19.399
ALL OF THAT, WE RESPECTFULLY ASK

01:57:19.465 --> 01:57:21.834
FOR YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU.

01:57:21.901 --> 01:57:22.735
GOOD MORNING, MR. CHAIR AND

01:57:22.802 --> 01:57:24.270
MEMBERS. AUDREY RATAJCZAK, ON

01:57:24.337 --> 01:57:26.172
BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA

IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO SB

01:57:29.742 --> 01:57:31.778
436. WHILE WE UNDERSTAND AND

01:57:31.844 --> 01:57:32.845
APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S INTENT

01:57:32.912 --> 01:57:34.313
TO HELP RESIDENTIAL TENANTS

01:57:34.380 --> 01:57:36.048
FACING HARDSHIP, WE BELIEVE THAT

01:57:36.115 --> 01:57:37.583
COMMERCIAL PROPERTY IS

01:57:37.650 --> 01:57:38.751
UNINTENTIONALLY CAPTURED IN SOME

01:57:38.818 --> 01:57:40.620
SECTIONS OF THE BILL. THERE ARE

01:57:40.686 --> 01:57:42.221
A FEW SECTIONS I WON'T LIST

01:57:42.288 --> 01:57:43.589
THEM, BUT THEY APPLY KIND OF

01:57:43.656 --> 01:57:45.458
BROADLY. AND AS WRITTEN, WE FEEL

01:57:45.525 --> 01:57:46.893
LIKE THAT WOULD EXTEND EVICTION

01:57:46.959 --> 01:57:47.560
TIMELINES FOR COMMERCIAL LEASES

01:57:47.627 --> 01:57:49.829
AS WELL. COMMERCIAL LEASES ARE

01:57:49.896 --> 01:57:51.898
NEGOTIATED BUSINESS TO BUSINESS

01:57:51.964 --> 01:57:53.499
CONTRACTS. SO FOR SMALL FAMILY

01:57:53.566 --> 01:57:55.101
AND MINORITY OWNED COMMERCIAL

01:57:55.168 --> 01:57:57.303
PROPERTY OWNERS, THE ABILITY TO

01:57:57.370 --> 01:57:58.838
ACT SWIFTLY WHEN RENT ISN'T PAID

01:57:58.905 --> 01:58:01.007
IS CRITICAL. EXTENDING NOTICE

01:58:01.073 --> 01:58:03.075
PERIODS TO 14 DAYS, EVEN IN

01:58:03.142 --> 01:58:04.477
CASES WHERE THE TENANT MAY

01:58:04.544 --> 01:58:06.112
SIMPLY CHOOSE TO WAIT, CAN CAUSE

01:58:06.179 --> 01:58:08.514
SERIOUS FINANCIAL HARM AND DELAY

01:58:08.581 --> 01:58:10.349
LAWFUL RECOURSE. AND WE ALSO

01:58:10.416 --> 01:58:11.384
WANT TO ECHO THE CONCERNS RAISED

01:58:11.451 --> 01:58:13.152
BY DEBORAH, THE APARTMENT

01:58:13.219 --> 01:58:14.754
ASSOCIATION. THE ANALYSIS CLAIMS

01:58:14.821 --> 01:58:16.322
THE BILL WOULD REDUCE THE BURDEN

01:58:16.389 --> 01:58:18.257
OF COURT PROCEEDINGS BY GIVING

01:58:18.324 --> 01:58:20.393
TENANTS MORE TIME TO PAY. BUT

01:58:20.460 --> 01:58:21.928
LANDLORDS CAN ALREADY CHOOSE TO

01:58:21.994 --> 01:58:23.729
WAIT. SO WE RESPECTFULLY ASK TO

01:58:23.796 --> 01:58:25.665
WORK WITH THE AUTHOR TO ENSURE

01:58:25.731 --> 01:58:26.933

01:58:26.999 --> 01:58:30.470

LANDLORD TENANCY CASES. AND I

01:59:47.613 --> 01:59:48.981
REMEMBER I USED TO REPRESENT

USED TO REPRESENT SENIORS. I

THAT HAD A HARD TIME SPEAKING

ENGLISH. SO SPANISH WAS THEIR

PRIMARY LANGUAGE. AND THIS WAS A

02:00:01.627 --> 02:00:03.029
VERY COMPLICATED PROCESS. AND

02:00:03.095 --> 02:00:05.898
WHAT I SAW WAS THAT THE EVICTION

02:00:05.965 --> 02:00:09.201
PROCESS COULD EASILY TAKE TWO

02:00:09.268 --> 02:00:10.703
MONTHS, THREE MONTHS, FOUR

02:00:10.770 --> 02:00:13.406
MONTHS, AND HAVING THE THREE DAY

02:00:13.472 --> 02:00:15.575
NOTICE TO PAY OR QUIT GAVE THE

02:00:15.641 --> 02:00:17.910
TENANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO PAY

02:00:17.977 --> 02:00:20.313
THEIR RENT. IF THE THIRD DAY

02:00:20.379 --> 02:00:22.315
FELL ON A SATURDAY OR A SUNDAY

02:00:22.381 --> 02:00:24.250
OR A HOLIDAY, IT GETS EXTENDED

02:00:24.317 --> 02:00:26.085
OUT. AND IT'S NOT LIKE THE THIRD

02:00:26.152 --> 02:00:28.454
DAY IS ALWAYS THE THIRD OF

02:00:28.521 --> 02:00:30.356
MONTH, BECAUSE THE TENANT HAS TO

02:00:30.423 --> 02:00:32.191
NOT HAVE PAID THEIR RENT FOR

02:00:32.258 --> 02:00:34.594
LIKE DAY ONE, DAY TWO, AND THEN

02:00:34.660 --> 02:00:36.429
AN EVICTION NOTICE WILL BE

02:00:36.495 --> 02:00:38.931
PROVIDED. AND SO I HAVE SEEN THE

02:00:38.998 --> 02:00:41.067
DELAYS THAT THE EVICTION PROCESS

02:00:41.133 --> 02:00:42.969
CAN LAST. HERE IN CALIFORNIA, I

02:00:43.035 --> 02:00:46.572
USED TO REPRESENT TENANTS IN LOS

02:00:46.639 --> 02:00:49.008
ANGELES COUNTY, AND SO I WORRY

02:00:49.075 --> 02:00:50.743
ABOUT THESE SMALL MOM AND POP

02:00:50.810 --> 02:00:52.979
LANDLORDS. I WORRY ABOUT THESE

02:00:53.045 --> 02:00:55.114
SENIORS WHO ARE GOING TO HAVE A

02:00:55.181 --> 02:00:56.983
HARDSHIP BECAUSE THEY RELY ON

02:00:57.049 --> 02:00:59.852
THIS MONEY FOR THEIR EXPENSES,

02:00:59.919 --> 02:01:01.621
FOR THEIR MORTGAGE, FOR WHATEVER

02:01:01.687 --> 02:01:03.089
THEY NEED. AND WE'RE PUTTING

02:01:03.155 --> 02:01:05.758
THEM IN A VERY BAD SITUATION.

02:01:05.825 --> 02:01:08.394
AND SO I DO CARE ABOUT SENIORS.

02:01:08.461 --> 02:01:09.962
I CARE ABOUT KEEPING THEM IN

02:01:10.029 --> 02:01:11.998
THEIR HOMES, AND I CARE ABOUT

02:01:12.064 --> 02:01:14.066
DOING WHAT'S BEST FOR THEM. AND

02:01:14.133 --> 02:01:18.204
SO I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS BILL.

02:01:18.270 --> 02:01:24.410
SO. YEAH, AND I, I TO ECHO THE

02:01:24.477 --> 02:01:25.478
STATEMENT FROM THE ASSEMBLYWOMAN

02:01:25.544 --> 02:01:27.813
FROM DOWNEY, A QUESTION FOR THE

AUTHOR. ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH

02:01:30.282 --> 02:01:32.585
THE AVERAGE PORTFOLIO OF A

02:01:32.652 --> 02:01:35.821
LANDLORD AND THE SIZE OF THAT

02:01:35.888 --> 02:01:36.489
PORTFOLIO? I'M SURE YOU WANT TO

02:01:36.555 --> 02:01:41.127
SHARE IT WITH ME. I DO. IT'S

02:01:41.193 --> 02:01:44.764
THREE. ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE

02:01:44.830 --> 02:01:46.232
AVERAGE AMOUNT OF PORTFOLIO THAT

02:01:46.298 --> 02:01:49.568
MAKE UP FROM MOM AND POP

02:01:49.635 --> 02:01:50.936
INDIVIDUALS WHO OWN THESE

02:01:51.003 --> 02:01:53.806
TENANTS, THESE UNITS, PLEASE,

02:01:53.873 --> 02:01:56.208
41% ARE SINGLE OWNERS OF THESE

02:01:56.275 --> 02:01:58.210
UNITS. AND SO. AND WHERE'S YOUR

02:01:58.277 --> 02:01:59.912
SOURCE? JP MORGAN ACTUALLY

02:01:59.979 --> 02:02:01.747
PROVIDED THAT IN 2023. AND IT'S

02:02:01.814 --> 02:02:03.149
FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR

02:02:03.215 --> 02:02:04.417
THE UNITED STATES, THE UNITED

02:02:04.483 --> 02:02:06.085
STATES. THEY WERE LOOKING AT IT

02:02:06.152 --> 02:02:07.553
AS A GENERAL. AND SO ABOUT I

02:02:07.620 --> 02:02:10.456
THINK IT'S ABOUT 41 41.8 MILLION

02:02:10.523 --> 02:02:13.059
ARE OWNED BY MOM AND POP. BUT

02:02:13.125 --> 02:02:15.061
NOW I CAN PROVIDE YOU MY

02:02:15.127 --> 02:02:16.462
PERSONAL SOURCE. I WORK IN REAL

02:02:16.529 --> 02:02:19.799
ESTATE. I'M ACTUALLY A LANDLORD

02:02:19.865 --> 02:02:21.967
MYSELF, AND I HAVE ONE UNIT THAT

02:02:22.034 --> 02:02:24.470
I MAKE $300 A MONTH ON THAT I

02:02:24.537 --> 02:02:26.305
RENT OUT TOWARDS STUDENTS TO

02:02:26.372 --> 02:02:28.340
HELP THEM OUT, SO THAT WAY THEY

02:02:28.407 --> 02:02:29.241
CAN HAVE AN AFFORDABLE RENTING

02:02:29.308 --> 02:02:30.643
SITUATION BECAUSE LESS THAN TEN

02:02:30.710 --> 02:02:32.378
YEARS AGO, I ENDED UP HOMELESS

02:02:32.445 --> 02:02:33.312
AND I WANTED TO PROVIDE THAT

02:02:33.379 --> 02:02:35.748
TYPE BECAUSE I DO CARE AS WELL.

02:02:35.815 --> 02:02:37.717
BUT THERE WAS A CASE BACK IN

02:02:37.783 --> 02:02:39.552
2021 THAT I WAS WORKING WITH TO

02:02:39.618 --> 02:02:44.156
SELL A HOME FROM A LANDLORD,

02:02:44.223 --> 02:02:47.093
BECAUSE WE PUT A AN EVICTION

02:02:47.159 --> 02:02:48.527
NOTICE THAT WE COULDN'T EVICT

02:02:48.594 --> 02:02:50.029
SOMEBODY, THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS

02:02:50.096 --> 02:02:52.765
ACTUALLY DID NOT PAY RENT FOR 12

02:02:52.832 --> 02:02:54.567
MONTHS, THAT THIS INDIVIDUAL IS

02:02:54.633 --> 02:02:57.203
NOW FORECLOSING ON HER RENTAL

02:02:57.269 --> 02:02:59.238
UNIT AND WAS CAUSING HER TO HAVE

02:02:59.305 --> 02:03:01.073
TO SELL IT AT SUCH A LARGE RATE,

02:03:01.140 --> 02:03:02.308
BECAUSE NOT ONLY DID THESE

02:03:02.374 --> 02:03:04.310
INDIVIDUALS NOT PAY RENT ON

02:03:04.376 --> 02:03:05.144
TIME, THEY STRIPPED THE ENTIRE

02:03:05.211 --> 02:03:06.545
PROPERTY DOWN, STOLE ALL THE

02:03:06.612 --> 02:03:08.314
COPPER WIRE, DESTROYED THE

02:03:08.380 --> 02:03:09.915
WALLS, AND NOW THAT THIS

02:03:09.982 --> 02:03:12.218
INDIVIDUAL IS OUT HER OWN

02:03:12.284 --> 02:03:15.221
RETIREMENT BECAUSE OF SOME OF

02:03:15.287 --> 02:03:16.322
THESE ISSUES THAT WE'VE HAD HERE

02:03:16.388 --> 02:03:18.090
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, NOT

02:03:18.157 --> 02:03:19.825
ONLY THAT, WE ARE THE MOST

02:03:19.892 --> 02:03:21.327
UNFRIENDLY STATE TO A LOT OF

02:03:21.393 --> 02:03:22.728
THESE LANDLORDS AND BUSINESSES

02:03:22.795 --> 02:03:24.296
THAT ARE JUST TRYING TO OPERATE

02:03:24.363 --> 02:03:26.232
AND PROVIDE THAT SAME THAT. I

02:03:26.298 --> 02:03:28.100
BELIEVE WE'RE EXAGGERATING THE

02:03:28.167 --> 02:03:29.335
ISSUE, ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE

02:03:29.401 --> 02:03:31.036
PUTTING THOSE SAME LANDLORDS IN

02:03:31.103 --> 02:03:32.171
THE POSITION OF THOSE WHO ARE

02:03:32.238 --> 02:03:33.606
JUST TRYING TO PROVIDE THEIR OWN

02:03:33.672 --> 02:03:35.374
STABLE HOUSING, THAT A LOT OF

02:03:35.441 --> 02:03:37.076
INDIVIDUALS THAT OWN ONE UNIT,

02:03:37.143 --> 02:03:42.047
ON AVERAGE, MAKE 300 TO $500 IF

02:03:42.114 --> 02:03:44.049
THEY STILL HAVE A MORTGAGE ON

02:03:44.116 --> 02:03:46.852
TOP OF IT. AND IT, YOU KNOW,

02:03:46.919 --> 02:03:49.655
THIS MAY SHIFT IT FROM 3 TO 14

02:03:49.722 --> 02:03:51.190
DAYS, BUT THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE

02:03:51.257 --> 02:03:52.658
30 DAYS TO KNOW WHEN THEIR THEIR

02:03:52.725 --> 02:03:55.094
BILL IS DUE. AND I UNDERSTAND

02:03:55.161 --> 02:03:57.229
THAT GROWING UP IN LOW INCOME

02:03:57.296 --> 02:03:59.698
COMMUNITIES, THERE'S GOT TO BE

02:03:59.765 --> 02:04:00.833
INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY AS

02:04:00.900 --> 02:04:02.601
WELL ON THOSE. I MEAN, I GREW UP

02:04:02.668 --> 02:04:04.003
IN LOW INCOME HOUSING, I

02:04:04.069 --> 02:04:08.741
UNDERSTAND IT THAT RIGHT NOW OUR

02:04:08.808 --> 02:04:12.011
LANDLORDS, MOST OF THEM MOM AND

02:04:12.077 --> 02:04:13.779
POP, OLDER INDIVIDUALS, THAT

02:04:13.846 --> 02:04:15.915
THEIR PROPERTY, THEIR SINGULAR

02:04:15.981 --> 02:04:17.383
PROPERTY IS THEIR ADDITIONAL

02:04:17.449 --> 02:04:19.585
INCOME, THAT THIS WOULD JUST ADD

02:04:19.652 --> 02:04:21.787
THE ADDITIONAL BURDEN AND REALLY

02:04:21.854 --> 02:04:25.324
HURT THEM AND RESPECTFULLY

02:04:25.391 --> 02:04:27.193
OPPOSE THIS. THANK YOU. I DO

02:04:27.259 --> 02:04:29.328
WANT TO HIGHLIGHT KEY WORDS HE

02:04:29.395 --> 02:04:31.697
USED WAS ADDITIONAL INCOME. SO

02:04:31.764 --> 02:04:32.865
IF THEY ARE SENIORS AND

02:04:32.932 --> 02:04:34.300
POTENTIALLY ON A FIXED INCOME, I

02:04:34.366 --> 02:04:36.101
DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT PEOPLE

02:04:36.168 --> 02:04:39.071
DON'T ALL HAVE THE LUXURY AND

02:04:39.138 --> 02:04:40.940
THE BENEFIT AND THE AFFLUENCE TO

02:04:41.006 --> 02:04:42.708
BE ABLE TO OWN A PROPERTY TO

02:04:42.775 --> 02:04:43.709
BEGIN WITH IN CALIFORNIA, LET

02:04:43.776 --> 02:04:45.077
ALONE SENIORS. I APPRECIATE THE

02:04:45.144 --> 02:04:46.278
DATA THAT YOU PROVIDED, AND I

02:04:46.345 --> 02:04:48.581
ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT IN

02:04:48.647 --> 02:04:49.815
CALIFORNIA, WE LACK DATA. EVERY

02:04:49.882 --> 02:04:51.617
SINGLE DATA, THAT EFFORT THAT

02:04:51.684 --> 02:04:53.052
HAS HAPPENED IN THE STATE OF

02:04:53.118 --> 02:04:55.554
CALIFORNIA TO IDENTIFY WHO OWNS

02:04:55.621 --> 02:04:57.656
WHAT PROPERTY AND TRANSPARENCY

02:04:57.723 --> 02:04:59.191
HAS BEEN KILLED IN THIS

02:04:59.258 --> 02:05:00.693
BUILDING. SO WHEN PEOPLE TALK

02:05:00.759 --> 02:05:01.994
ABOUT SMALL MOM AND POP

02:05:02.061 --> 02:05:03.162
LANDLORDS, AND I WANT TO

02:05:03.229 --> 02:05:04.930
HIGHLIGHT THIS AS MY OWN

02:05:04.997 --> 02:05:07.032
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE, IS THAT IN

02:05:07.099 --> 02:05:09.468
THE CITY OF HAYWARD, AS A CITY

02:05:09.535 --> 02:05:10.202
COUNCIL MEMBER, I WOULD GET

02:05:10.269 --> 02:05:11.871
EMAILS FROM PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT

02:05:11.937 --> 02:05:13.973
HOW THEY'RE A SMALL MOM AND POP

02:05:14.039 --> 02:05:15.074
LANDLORD. SMALL MOM AND POP AT A

02:05:15.140 --> 02:05:17.176
LOCAL LEVEL IS UNDER FIVE UNITS,

02:05:17.243 --> 02:05:18.978
AND THE REALITY WAS THAT THIS

02:05:19.044 --> 02:05:20.746
PARTICULAR LANDLORD HAD OVER

02:05:20.813 --> 02:05:22.248
1000 UNITS IN THE EAST BAY.

02:05:22.314 --> 02:05:23.949
RIGHT? BUT SAYING THAT THEY WERE

02:05:24.016 --> 02:05:25.851
A SMALL MOM AND POP. IN FACT,

02:05:25.918 --> 02:05:27.686
OUR RECORDS WHEN WE WERE DOING

02:05:27.753 --> 02:05:28.787
PROPERTY ASSESSMENTS AND MUCH

02:05:28.854 --> 02:05:31.223
MORE WHEN WE WERE CREATING A

02:05:31.290 --> 02:05:31.891
DATABASE IN THE CITY OF HAYWARD,

02:05:31.957 --> 02:05:34.460
SHOWED THAT THEY OWNED 89 UNITS.

02:05:34.526 --> 02:05:37.263
RIGHT. AND EACH PROPERTY IS

02:05:37.329 --> 02:05:40.199
UNDER A DIFFERENT LLC THAT

02:05:40.266 --> 02:05:42.034
COVERS AND HIDES WHO REALLY OWNS

02:05:42.101 --> 02:05:44.203
IT. SO THERE IS NO TRANSPARENCY

02:05:44.270 --> 02:05:46.639
ON GOOD ACTING AND BAD ACTING

02:05:46.705 --> 02:05:48.040
LANDLORDS. WE ALSO KNOW THAT

02:05:48.107 --> 02:05:49.875
THERE ARE MANY STORIES OF

02:05:49.942 --> 02:05:53.178
ABUSES, AND THE LANDLORDS OFTEN

02:05:53.245 --> 02:05:55.314
FOCUS ON EDGE CASES AND BRING UP

02:05:55.381 --> 02:05:56.482
THEORETICAL SCENARIOS OF THE

02:05:56.548 --> 02:05:58.150
WORST TENANTS. AND I FULLY AGREE

02:05:58.217 --> 02:06:00.019
WITH YOU. WHEN PEOPLE ARE

02:06:00.085 --> 02:06:02.922
STRIPPING A PROPERTY, TAKING

02:06:02.988 --> 02:06:04.056
COPPER OUT, WE'VE SEEN THIS,

02:06:04.123 --> 02:06:06.125
WE'VE SEEN IT IN THE NEWS AND SO

02:06:06.191 --> 02:06:07.493
FORTH. I DON'T SUPPORT THAT. I

02:06:07.559 --> 02:06:09.361
DON'T SUPPORT THAT AT ALL. BUT

02:06:09.428 --> 02:06:11.997
OUR ROLES AS POLICYMAKERS IS TO

02:06:12.064 --> 02:06:13.799
FIND THE BALANCE. AND IT'S

02:06:13.866 --> 02:06:15.067
REALLY THE BALANCE THAT I'M

02:06:15.134 --> 02:06:16.769
LOOKING FOR IN THIS. AND I THINK

02:06:16.835 --> 02:06:19.471
14 DAYS IS TRULY A BALANCE. AND

02:06:19.538 --> 02:06:21.907
I UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE A

02:06:21.974 --> 02:06:23.842
LEASE, I HAVE I HAVE TO RENT TWO

02:06:23.909 --> 02:06:25.544
PROPERTIES JUST BECAUSE OF THE,

02:06:25.611 --> 02:06:27.046
YOU KNOW, SACRAMENTO AND THE BAY

02:06:27.112 --> 02:06:29.181
AREA. I KNOW WHEN I HAVE TO PAY.

02:06:29.248 --> 02:06:31.550
I KNOW ALL OF THOSE THINGS. BUT

02:06:31.617 --> 02:06:33.085
I ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT

02:06:33.152 --> 02:06:35.621
THREE DAYS IS NOT ENOUGH. WE

02:06:35.688 --> 02:06:37.222
FIXED IT FOR HOMEOWNERS DURING

02:06:37.289 --> 02:06:39.291
THE GREAT RECESSION, BUT WE DID

02:06:39.358 --> 02:06:42.494
NOT FIX IT FOR APARTMENT

02:06:42.561 --> 02:06:44.363
RENTERS. AND I REALLY WANT TO

02:06:44.430 --> 02:06:45.798
HIGHLIGHT THAT BECAUSE OF THE

02:06:45.864 --> 02:06:47.266
FACT THAT THERE IS AN IMBALANCE

02:06:47.333 --> 02:06:48.934
AND TO FOCUS ON BAD TENANTS

02:06:49.001 --> 02:06:50.402
WITHOUT DISCUSSING THE BAD

02:06:50.469 --> 02:06:51.503
LANDLORDS AND NOT BEING ABLE TO

02:06:51.570 --> 02:06:53.305
HAVE THE DATA AND THE

02:06:53.372 --> 02:06:54.406
TRANSPARENCY, THAT IS A

02:06:54.473 --> 02:06:56.542
DISSERVICE TO ANY POLICY

02:06:56.608 --> 02:06:57.810
CONVERSATION RELATED TO TENANT

02:06:57.876 --> 02:06:59.578
AND LANDLORD CONCERNS. I'VE

02:06:59.645 --> 02:07:01.513
HEARD TIME AND TIME AGAIN THAT

02:07:01.580 --> 02:07:03.349
SMALL LANDLORDS ARE OFTEN MORE

02:07:03.415 --> 02:07:05.851
WILLING TO OFFER GRACE AND TIME

02:07:05.918 --> 02:07:07.252
EXTENSIONS AND MUCH MORE. AND I

02:07:07.319 --> 02:07:08.087
DO BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE THEY

02:07:08.153 --> 02:07:10.522
BUILD A RELATIONSHIP, THEY KNOW

02:07:10.589 --> 02:07:13.058
HOW IT IS TO POTENTIALLY BE A

02:07:13.125 --> 02:07:15.361
RENTER. AND THEY ARE NOT THESE

02:07:15.427 --> 02:07:16.628
BIG CORPORATE LANDLORDS THAT

02:07:16.695 --> 02:07:18.063
HAVE, YOU KNOW, SAVINGS AND MUCH

02:07:18.130 --> 02:07:19.898
MORE. BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER

02:07:19.965 --> 02:07:21.233
IS THAT THERE ARE LANDLORDS WHO

02:07:21.300 --> 02:07:23.135
WILL NOT WORK WITH THEIR TENANTS

02:07:23.202 --> 02:07:24.570
AND WHO DO NOT CARE THAT THEIR

02:07:24.636 --> 02:07:27.106
TENANT IS IN THE HOSPITAL, WHO

02:07:27.172 --> 02:07:29.375
MAY HAVE BEEN LAID OFF, WHO IS A

02:07:29.441 --> 02:07:30.642
SINGLE MOM, WHO IS STRUGGLING,

02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:33.178
WHO IS HAS A LATE PAYCHECK, OR

02:07:33.245 --> 02:07:34.780
FEDERAL WORKERS WHEN WE TALK

02:07:34.847 --> 02:07:35.714
ABOUT THEM AND SOMETIMES THE

02:07:35.781 --> 02:07:37.950
FREEZES AND MUCH MORE. WE HAVE

02:07:38.017 --> 02:07:39.752
TO AGAIN, AS POLICYMAKERS STRIKE

02:07:39.818 --> 02:07:41.520
A BALANCE. AND I DO WANT TO

02:07:41.587 --> 02:07:43.255
HIGHLIGHT THAT AS MUCH AS

02:07:43.322 --> 02:07:44.523
POSSIBLE AS WHY THIS IS

02:07:44.590 --> 02:07:48.260
IMPORTANT. THANK YOU, MADAM VICE

02:07:48.327 --> 02:07:50.896
CHAIR. THANK YOU. I JUST HAVE A

02:07:50.963 --> 02:07:54.099
QUICK QUESTION. WHAT IS TO AND

02:07:54.166 --> 02:07:57.536
I'M SYMPATHETIC TO MOM AND POP,

02:07:57.603 --> 02:07:59.138
AS YOU SAY, WHETHER THAT'S A

02:07:59.204 --> 02:08:00.305
EUPHEMISM FOR ALL LANDLORDS, I

02:08:00.372 --> 02:08:01.607
DON'T KNOW, BUT I PERSONALLY

02:08:01.673 --> 02:08:02.741
KNOW PEOPLE. IT'S NOT THEIR

02:08:02.808 --> 02:08:04.676
EXTRA INCOME, IT'S THEIR INCOME,

02:08:04.743 --> 02:08:05.811
THEIR SOLE INCOME. AND THAT'S

02:08:05.878 --> 02:08:07.579
HOW THEY PAY THE MORTGAGE FOR

02:08:07.646 --> 02:08:11.383
THE DUPLEX. BUT GETTING TO THE

02:08:11.450 --> 02:08:14.219
TERMS OF THE BILL, IS THERE

02:08:14.286 --> 02:08:16.055
ANYTHING THAT PREVENTS OR

02:08:16.121 --> 02:08:18.357
PROHIBITS TENANT TO DO THIS

02:08:18.424 --> 02:08:20.325
EVERY MONTH TO SAY, I'M GOING TO

02:08:20.392 --> 02:08:22.294
BE LATE AND GIVE ME 14 MORE

02:08:22.361 --> 02:08:24.897
DAYS? AND THEN THEY START THE

02:08:24.963 --> 02:08:26.565
PROCEEDINGS AFTER 14 DAYS AND

02:08:26.632 --> 02:08:28.100
THEN BUT TO YOU'RE USING YOUR

02:08:28.167 --> 02:08:30.936
OWN WORDS. YOU SAID EVERYBODY

02:08:31.003 --> 02:08:32.004
KNOWS WHEN THEY'RE RENTING, WHEN

02:08:32.071 --> 02:08:35.007
THE RENT IS DUE. AND HALFWAY

02:08:35.074 --> 02:08:36.341
INTO THE PRECEDING MONTH, THEY

02:08:36.408 --> 02:08:38.177
KNOW THAT IN TWO WEEKS THEY NEED

02:08:38.243 --> 02:08:41.213
TO PAY THE RENT. THIS IS JUST A

02:08:41.280 --> 02:08:44.249
VICIOUS CYCLE. AND TO GO 14 DAYS

02:08:44.316 --> 02:08:46.418
AND THEN RELIEF AND THEN THE

02:08:46.485 --> 02:08:48.253
EVICTION PROCESS STARTS AND

02:08:48.320 --> 02:08:51.857
COULD BE 2 OR 3 OR MORE MONTHS.

02:08:51.924 --> 02:08:53.225
I JUST I DON'T SEE ANY

02:08:53.292 --> 02:08:56.628
GUARDRAILS ON ON THIS. SO ARE

02:08:56.695 --> 02:08:58.230
THERE ANY I WAS GOING TO JUST

02:08:58.297 --> 02:09:03.001
YOU WANT TO ADDRESS SOMETHING.

02:09:03.068 --> 02:09:04.803
ACTUALLY I, I ALSO AGREE WITH

02:09:04.870 --> 02:09:06.338
YOU ON THAT. AND I DO BELIEVE

02:09:06.405 --> 02:09:07.873
THAT THERE SHOULD BE GUARDRAILS

02:09:07.940 --> 02:09:09.041
AND I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO

02:09:09.108 --> 02:09:10.876
COMMIT TO THAT. I ALSO HEARD

02:09:10.943 --> 02:09:12.244
FROM ONE OF THE OPPOSITION

02:09:12.311 --> 02:09:13.712
WITNESSES REGARDING THE

02:09:13.779 --> 02:09:16.215
COMMERCIAL PIECE. WE DO BELIEVE

02:09:16.281 --> 02:09:18.050
THAT OUR BILL IS SPECIFICALLY

02:09:18.117 --> 02:09:20.285
ABOUT RESIDENTIAL, BUT WE ARE

02:09:20.352 --> 02:09:23.222
WILLING TO CLARIFY BOTH THINGS.

02:09:23.288 --> 02:09:24.923
RIGHT? ONE, THE SAFEGUARDS THAT

02:09:24.990 --> 02:09:27.192
IS NEEDED. AND I FULLY, FULLY

02:09:27.259 --> 02:09:29.895
INTEND TO DO THAT, AS WELL AS TO

02:09:29.962 --> 02:09:30.896
CLARIFY THAT OUR INTENTION IS

02:09:30.963 --> 02:09:32.164
NOT TO CAPTURE THE COMMERCIAL

02:09:32.231 --> 02:09:33.265
PROPERTIES, BECAUSE THIS IS NOT

02:09:33.332 --> 02:09:35.400
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. AND SO I'M

02:09:35.467 --> 02:09:37.936
COMMITTED ON RECORD TO

02:09:38.003 --> 02:09:38.637
ADDRESSING THAT. OKAY. VERY

02:09:38.704 --> 02:09:42.274
GOOD. THANK YOU. SO THANK YOU,

02:09:42.341 --> 02:09:44.109
MR. CHAIR. FIRST OF ALL, I JUST

02:09:44.176 --> 02:09:46.111
WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THE

02:09:46.178 --> 02:09:47.346
PASSION AND THE FIGHT. I MEAN, I

02:09:47.412 --> 02:09:49.014
DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S A MORE

02:09:49.081 --> 02:09:50.048
PASSIONATE ADVOCATE ON THESE

02:09:50.115 --> 02:09:51.850
ISSUES THAN YOU. AND JUST

02:09:51.917 --> 02:09:54.186
WATCHING YOU DO YOUR WORK AND

02:09:54.253 --> 02:09:55.587
TESTIFY AND PUT YOUR HEART AND

02:09:55.654 --> 02:09:57.923
SOUL INTO IT IS ADMIRABLE. AND I

02:09:57.990 --> 02:09:59.491
AND I THINK THAT YOU AND I SHARE

02:09:59.558 --> 02:10:02.261
THE SAME GOAL, WHICH IS TO TRY

02:10:02.327 --> 02:10:03.395
TO AVOID EVICTIONS, TO KEEP

02:10:03.462 --> 02:10:05.297
PEOPLE IN THEIR HOUSE. I THINK

02:10:05.364 --> 02:10:06.698
WHERE WE DISAGREE IS WHETHER

02:10:06.765 --> 02:10:08.500
IT'S THE THREE DAY PAYER QUIT OR

02:10:08.567 --> 02:10:10.002
WHETHER THERE'S A BIGGER ISSUE,

02:10:10.068 --> 02:10:11.537
WHICH YOU ARE TRYING TO SOLVE.

02:10:11.603 --> 02:10:13.105
IN THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THIS

02:10:13.172 --> 02:10:14.907
BILL, WHICH WAS THE REDEMPTION,

02:10:14.973 --> 02:10:16.441
RIGHT, THE RIGHT TO REDEEM. TO

02:10:16.508 --> 02:10:18.310
ME, THAT IS WHERE I THINK A LOT

02:10:18.377 --> 02:10:20.445
OF THE CHANGE COMES. AND YOU'VE

02:10:20.512 --> 02:10:22.147
SEEN IN OTHER STATES WHERE

02:10:22.214 --> 02:10:23.282
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT'S A

02:10:23.348 --> 02:10:25.083
THREE DAY, A SEVEN DAY OR 14

02:10:25.150 --> 02:10:26.485
DAY, WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS

02:10:26.552 --> 02:10:28.687
DISINCENTIVIZE EVICTION ACTIONS.

02:10:28.754 --> 02:10:30.122
UNLAWFUL DETAINER ACTIONS KEEP

02:10:30.189 --> 02:10:31.823
PEOPLE IN THEIR HOUSES AND GIVE

02:10:31.890 --> 02:10:35.394
THEM A RIGHT TO COME FULLY, YOU

02:10:35.460 --> 02:10:37.896
KNOW, PAY OFF THEIR RENT. THE

02:10:37.963 --> 02:10:39.164
RIGHT TO REDEEM ALLOWS THEM TO

02:10:39.231 --> 02:10:41.533
DO THAT. I DON'T THINK THAT THE

02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:42.834
CURRENT STATE OF LAW IN

02:10:42.901 --> 02:10:44.570
CALIFORNIA IS FAIR ENOUGH FOR

02:10:44.636 --> 02:10:46.305
RENTERS. SO FOR ME, THE SOLUTION

02:10:46.371 --> 02:10:48.407
IS WHAT YOU WERE TRYING TO DO

02:10:48.473 --> 02:10:49.007
ORIGINALLY. AND IT'S TOO BAD

02:10:49.074 --> 02:10:51.410
BECAUSE IT COMES TO US IN A

02:10:51.476 --> 02:10:52.778
DIFFERENT FORM, A FORM THAT ONLY

02:10:52.844 --> 02:10:54.313
DEALS WITH A PORTION OF THE LAW.

02:10:54.379 --> 02:10:56.515
THAT, TO ME IS REALLY NOT WHERE

02:10:56.582 --> 02:10:58.450
I THINK THE CHANGE NEEDS TO BE

02:10:58.517 --> 02:10:59.651
DONE. I THINK THREE VERSUS 14, I

02:10:59.718 --> 02:11:00.686
THINK, FRANKLY, WE'RE KICKING

02:11:00.752 --> 02:11:02.521
THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD UNLESS

02:11:02.588 --> 02:11:03.689
WE'RE DOING A RIGHT TO

02:11:03.755 --> 02:11:05.390
REDEMPTION BILL. SO I CAN'T

02:11:05.457 --> 02:11:06.325
SUPPORT THIS BILL AS IT IS NOW,

02:11:06.391 --> 02:11:08.961
NOT BECAUSE YOU AND I DIFFER ON

02:11:09.027 --> 02:11:10.362
THE OUTCOMES. WE WANT TO AVOID

02:11:10.429 --> 02:11:11.797
EVICTIONS. I THINK THAT THE

02:11:11.863 --> 02:11:13.165
ORIGINAL VERSION OF THIS BILL

02:11:13.232 --> 02:11:14.700
AND ACTUALLY FOCUSING ON

02:11:14.766 --> 02:11:17.502
REDEMPTION IS WHERE I THINK THE

02:11:17.569 --> 02:11:19.037
LAW NEEDS TO BE CHANGED. SO I

02:11:19.104 --> 02:11:20.339
LOOK FORWARD TO YOU BRINGING

02:11:20.405 --> 02:11:22.541
BACK A BILL THAT THAT LOOKS MORE

02:11:22.608 --> 02:11:25.077
LIKE THE ORIGINAL ONE. BUT

02:11:25.143 --> 02:11:26.878
REGARDLESS, THANK YOU FOR YOUR

02:11:26.945 --> 02:11:27.479
FOR YOUR TIME HERE TODAY AND

02:11:27.546 --> 02:11:29.548
THANK YOU FOR THE BILL. I THINK

02:11:29.615 --> 02:11:32.351
THE AUTHORS ASKED ME TO RESPOND

02:11:32.417 --> 02:11:34.519
TO THAT, IF I MAY. WELL, I, OF

02:11:34.586 --> 02:11:35.854
COURSE, AGREE WITH YOU. AS

02:11:35.921 --> 02:11:37.356
SOMEONE WHO HAS WORKED ON THE

02:11:37.422 --> 02:11:39.458
RIGHT TO REDEEM, I WOULD LOVE TO

02:11:39.524 --> 02:11:40.759
SEE THAT BILL BROUGHT BEFORE

02:11:40.826 --> 02:11:43.295
THIS CHAMBER, THIS BODY. AND I

02:11:43.362 --> 02:11:45.330
AGREE WITH YOU. I DO WANT TO SAY

02:11:45.397 --> 02:11:48.500
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHY I THINK

02:11:48.567 --> 02:11:49.601
THE 14 DAYS ACTUALLY HELPS

02:11:49.668 --> 02:11:51.003
LANDLORDS MORE THAN THREE, AS

02:11:51.069 --> 02:11:52.838
MANY OF THE CASES THAT I

02:11:52.904 --> 02:11:55.007
REPRESENT, THEY END UP IN A

02:11:55.073 --> 02:11:56.441
JUDGMENT FOR EVICTION AGAINST

02:11:56.508 --> 02:11:58.710
THE TENANT WHO GETS EVICTED AND

02:11:58.777 --> 02:12:00.712
GETS A MONEY JUDGMENT ENTERED

02:12:00.779 --> 02:12:02.648
AGAINST THEM FOR THE AMOUNT THAT

02:12:02.714 --> 02:12:05.417
THEY OWED, AS THE LAW WOULD,

02:12:05.484 --> 02:12:07.252
WOULD DELIVER ONE MONTH, TWO

02:12:07.319 --> 02:12:08.520
MONTHS, THREE MONTHS, DEPENDING

02:12:08.587 --> 02:12:10.188
ON HOW LONG IT TAKES THAT CASE

02:12:10.255 --> 02:12:12.090
TO GET TO TRIAL. HOW MUCH RENT

02:12:12.157 --> 02:12:13.425
HAS ACCRUED BY THE TIME THE

02:12:13.492 --> 02:12:14.226
JUDGMENT IS ENTERED. DO

02:12:14.293 --> 02:12:16.261
LANDLORDS SEE THAT MONEY?

02:12:16.328 --> 02:12:19.064
ABSOLUTELY NOT. MY CLIENTS DON'T

02:12:19.131 --> 02:12:21.333
HAVE EXTRA MONEY. THEY ARE. SOME

02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:23.435
OF THEM ARE JUDGMENT PROOF. SOME

02:12:23.502 --> 02:12:25.537
LANDLORDS DO NOT SEE THAT MONEY.

02:12:25.604 --> 02:12:28.473
THERE IS RENTAL ASSISTANCE MONEY

02:12:28.540 --> 02:12:31.009
LOCALLY, NON, PRIVATELY AND

02:12:31.076 --> 02:12:33.612
PRIVATELY AND PUBLICLY THAT IS

02:12:33.679 --> 02:12:35.147
AVAILABLE FOR LANDLORDS TO FILL

02:12:35.213 --> 02:12:37.849
IN SOME OF THESE GAPS. THIS IS

02:12:37.916 --> 02:12:38.950
ACTUAL MONEY THAT WOULD GO TO

02:12:39.017 --> 02:12:41.186
ACTUAL LANDLORDS. BUT MY CLIENTS

02:12:41.253 --> 02:12:43.922
CANNOT GET THAT MONEY FLOWING IN

02:12:43.989 --> 02:12:45.457
THREE DAYS NOW. MAYBE THE

02:12:45.524 --> 02:12:47.292
LANDLORD WILL ACCEPT IT AFTER

02:12:47.359 --> 02:12:48.894
FILING THE ACTION, BUT THEY

02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:51.530
DON'T HAVE TO. AND IF WE'RE

02:12:51.596 --> 02:12:53.298
GOING TO DO YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO

02:12:53.365 --> 02:12:54.933
BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:56.168
LEGISLATING BY ANECDOTE, RIGHT?

02:12:56.234 --> 02:12:58.003
BECAUSE WE CAN HEAR ANECDOTES

02:12:58.070 --> 02:13:00.138
ABOUT THE HORRIBLE TENANTS. I

02:13:00.205 --> 02:13:02.074
CAN TELL YOU STORIES ABOUT

02:13:02.140 --> 02:13:04.076
LANDLORDS WHO WOULD ACCEPT THAT

02:13:04.142 --> 02:13:05.210
RENTAL ASSISTANCE, WHO WOULD

02:13:05.277 --> 02:13:08.146
ACCEPT THAT MONEY ON DAY 20,

02:13:08.213 --> 02:13:10.949
EXCEPT FOR RACIAL ANIMUS, EXCEPT

02:13:11.016 --> 02:13:12.551
FOR DISCRIMINATING AGAINST

02:13:12.617 --> 02:13:14.519
PEOPLE OF COLOR, PEOPLE WITH

02:13:14.586 --> 02:13:15.654
DISABILITIES? YOU'RE TOO MUCH

02:13:15.721 --> 02:13:17.222
TROUBLE. I DON'T WANT TO

02:13:17.289 --> 02:13:19.191
ACCOMMODATE YOUR DISABILITY. OH,

02:13:19.257 --> 02:13:21.059
GOTCHA. YOU WERE LATE ON YOUR

02:13:21.126 --> 02:13:23.195
RENT, AND IT'S DAY FOUR. YOU'RE

02:13:23.261 --> 02:13:25.731
GONE. THAT KIND OF PRETEXTUAL

02:13:25.797 --> 02:13:27.532
REFUSAL TO ACCEPT RENTAL

02:13:27.599 --> 02:13:29.301
ASSISTANCE OR OTHER FUNDS THAT

02:13:29.368 --> 02:13:31.103
THE LANDLORD HAS BEEN ABLE TO

02:13:31.169 --> 02:13:32.637
GATHER, THAT IS NOT THE BEHAVIOR

02:13:32.704 --> 02:13:34.806
THAT THIS LEGISLATURE WANTS TO

02:13:34.873 --> 02:13:37.242
INCENTIVIZE. AND 14 DAYS GIVES

02:13:37.309 --> 02:13:39.344
TIME FOR THAT MONEY TO FLOW. A

02:13:39.411 --> 02:13:40.912
LANDLORD DOESN'T END UP WITH AN

02:13:40.979 --> 02:13:42.714
ABSOLUTELY USELESS MONEY

02:13:42.781 --> 02:13:44.116
JUDGMENT, BUT INSTEAD GETS THE

02:13:44.182 --> 02:13:46.918
MONEY THAT YOU ALL AND OTHERS

02:13:46.985 --> 02:13:48.487
HAVE APPROPRIATED TO KEEP

02:13:48.553 --> 02:13:50.622
LANDLORDS IN BUSINESS. AND THIS

02:13:50.689 --> 02:13:53.525
14 DAYS IS BY NO MEANS, YOU

02:13:53.592 --> 02:13:55.627
KNOW, DOOMSDAY. IT'S WHAT MANY,

02:13:55.694 --> 02:13:57.963
MANY STATES DO, AND IT WILL MAKE

02:13:58.029 --> 02:14:01.466
MONEY FLOW TO LANDLORDS. I ALSO

02:14:01.533 --> 02:14:03.602
JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT, YOU

02:14:03.668 --> 02:14:05.670
KNOW, I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR, I

02:14:05.737 --> 02:14:08.607
HEAR EVERYBODY AND I HEAR WHAT

02:14:08.673 --> 02:14:10.742
YOU'VE SAID, AND I WILL

02:14:10.809 --> 02:14:11.743
HIGHLIGHT THAT THE ORIGINAL

02:14:11.810 --> 02:14:13.678
INTENT OF THIS BILL HAS BEEN

02:14:13.745 --> 02:14:16.515
WATERED DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY. AND,

02:14:16.581 --> 02:14:17.582
YOU KNOW, YOU MAY THINK IT'S

02:14:17.649 --> 02:14:19.518
KICKING THE CAN. AND FOR ME,

02:14:19.584 --> 02:14:21.686
IT'S CHIPPING AWAY AT THE BIGGER

02:14:21.753 --> 02:14:22.954
ISSUE. THE REALITY IS, DOING THE

02:14:23.021 --> 02:14:24.456
RIGHT THING IN THIS BUILDING

02:14:24.523 --> 02:14:25.657
SEEMS VERY DIFFICULT WHEN IT

02:14:25.724 --> 02:14:27.726
COMES TO TENANTS, RIGHT? WE HAVE

02:14:27.793 --> 02:14:29.127
THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT

02:14:29.194 --> 02:14:30.862
ASSOCIATION SPENDING MILLIONS OF

02:14:30.929 --> 02:14:33.398
DOLLARS ON SPECIFIC MEMBERS, ON

02:14:33.465 --> 02:14:35.133
MEMBERS THAT ARE SYMPATHETIC, ON

02:14:35.200 --> 02:14:36.835
PEOPLE THAT WANT TO DO THE RIGHT

02:14:36.902 --> 02:14:38.403
THING. AND I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT

02:14:38.470 --> 02:14:39.805
THAT BECAUSE THAT IS THE BIG

02:14:39.871 --> 02:14:42.374
ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM. RIGHT? DO

02:14:42.441 --> 02:14:44.843
WE DO ENOUGH FOR THE MOST

02:14:44.910 --> 02:14:46.378
VULNERABLE, THE PEOPLE THAT DO

02:14:46.445 --> 02:14:47.746
NOT HAVE THE AFFLUENCE OF TIME

02:14:47.813 --> 02:14:50.282
TO SHOW UP ON A TUESDAY MORNING

02:14:50.348 --> 02:14:51.750
TO ADVOCATE FOR THEMSELVES, WHO

02:14:51.817 --> 02:14:53.518
DO NOT HAVE THE AFFLUENCE OF

02:14:53.585 --> 02:14:55.153
FINANCIAL BACKING, TO BE ABLE TO

02:14:55.220 --> 02:14:57.422
TAKE A DAY OFF AND ADVOCATE.

02:14:57.489 --> 02:14:59.257
YOU'VE HEARD FROM A NUMBER OF

02:14:59.324 --> 02:15:01.526
DIFFERENT ADVOCATES THAT

02:15:01.593 --> 02:15:03.562
REPRESENT A LOT OF DIFFERENT

02:15:03.628 --> 02:15:05.030
STAKEHOLDERS SAYING THIS IS THE

02:15:05.096 --> 02:15:07.365
RIGHT THING TO DO, AND I

02:15:07.432 --> 02:15:08.667
UNDERSTAND THE HESITATION THAT

02:15:08.733 --> 02:15:10.469
PEOPLE HAVE. RIGHT. YOU KNOW, DO

02:15:10.535 --> 02:15:11.903
YOU REALLY WANT MILLIONS OF

02:15:11.970 --> 02:15:15.507
DOLLARS GOING AGAINST, YOU KNOW,

02:15:15.574 --> 02:15:17.342
AND I REALLY WANT TO HIGHLIGHT

02:15:17.409 --> 02:15:20.078
THE FACT THAT, AGAIN, AS

02:15:20.145 --> 02:15:21.646
POLICYMAKERS, THE WHOLE POINT OF

02:15:21.713 --> 02:15:23.715
HAVING THIS SEAT IS TO DO THE

02:15:23.782 --> 02:15:26.284
RIGHT THING BY ALL PEOPLE. AND

02:15:26.351 --> 02:15:28.320
SO I HAVE COMMITTED TO ENSURING

02:15:28.386 --> 02:15:30.755
THAT WE CLARIFY THAT WE ARE

02:15:30.822 --> 02:15:33.225
GOING TO PROTECT AS MANY PEOPLE

02:15:33.291 --> 02:15:35.660
AS POSSIBLE, INCLUDING THE SMALL

02:15:35.727 --> 02:15:36.728
MOM AND POP LANDLORD, BUT ALSO,

02:15:36.795 --> 02:15:38.263
YOU KNOW, MAKING SURE THAT WE

02:15:38.330 --> 02:15:39.498
REMOVE THE COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES

02:15:39.564 --> 02:15:42.167
AS ONE OF THE CONSIDERATIONS.

02:15:42.234 --> 02:15:43.668
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS

02:15:43.735 --> 02:15:45.170
KICKING THE CAN. I THINK THAT

02:15:45.237 --> 02:15:46.338
THIS IS TACKLING THE PROBLEM

02:15:46.404 --> 02:15:49.374
STEP BY STEP. AND IF WE CAN'T DO

02:15:49.441 --> 02:15:50.275
THE LITTLE THING RIGHT IN FRONT

02:15:50.342 --> 02:15:52.210
OF US, HOW ARE WE EVER GOING TO

02:15:52.277 --> 02:15:54.012
DO THE BIG THING? THAT'S THE

02:15:54.079 --> 02:15:55.847
HONEST TRUTH. ASSEMBLYMEMBER

02:15:55.914 --> 02:15:59.618
CONNELLY. I ALSO WANT TO THANK

02:15:59.684 --> 02:16:01.686
THE AUTHOR FOR COMING FORWARD.

02:16:01.753 --> 02:16:04.055
AND ACTUALLY THE QUALITY OF THE

02:16:04.122 --> 02:16:06.324
DISCUSSION THIS MORNING. A LOT

02:16:06.391 --> 02:16:09.361
OF MY WHAT I WOULD CALL CONCERNS

02:16:09.427 --> 02:16:12.364
ABOUT THE BILL HAVE BEEN AIRED.

02:16:12.430 --> 02:16:14.132
AND GOING TO MY COLLEAGUE'S

02:16:14.199 --> 02:16:15.367
POINT, KIND OF STRUGGLING WITH

02:16:15.433 --> 02:16:19.871
THE THREE VERSUS 14 AS A

02:16:19.938 --> 02:16:20.505
PRACTICING LAWYER, I HAD A

02:16:20.572 --> 02:16:23.508
LITTLE BIT OF EXPERIENCE IN THIS

02:16:23.575 --> 02:16:24.943
FIELD. DOESN'T SOUND LIKE AS

02:16:25.010 --> 02:16:26.678
MUCH AS MY DISTINGUISHED

02:16:26.745 --> 02:16:28.947
COLLEAGUE, BUT IT ALWAYS STRUCK

02:16:29.014 --> 02:16:32.551
ME THAT THREE DAYS SEEM BOTH

02:16:32.617 --> 02:16:36.154
STARTLINGLY QUICK AND SUDDEN.

02:16:36.221 --> 02:16:38.223
YET WHEN YOU GOT INTO THE

02:16:38.290 --> 02:16:40.559
PROCESS, INEVITABLY IT WAS GOING

02:16:40.625 --> 02:16:41.927
TO LAST SEVERAL MONTHS ANYWAY,

02:16:41.993 --> 02:16:45.196
SO I HAD A LOT OF SYMPATHY FOR

02:16:45.263 --> 02:16:47.732
SMALL MOM AND POP LANDLORDS

02:16:47.799 --> 02:16:50.201
NAVIGATING THAT AS WELL. SO I

02:16:50.268 --> 02:16:52.037
GUESS A QUESTION IS, AND I

02:16:52.103 --> 02:16:55.073
APPRECIATE THE WILLINGNESS TO

02:16:55.140 --> 02:16:56.741
KIND OF LOOK AT GUARDRAILS

02:16:56.808 --> 02:16:59.945
AROUND THIS CANNOT BE A DE FACTO

02:17:00.011 --> 02:17:02.547
TWO WEEK EXTENSION OF PAYMENT OF

02:17:02.614 --> 02:17:04.549
RENT. IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE

02:17:04.616 --> 02:17:06.785
LOOKING AT SOME OF THE OTHER

02:17:06.851 --> 02:17:07.686
CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED.

02:17:07.752 --> 02:17:10.722
BUT AT THE HEART OF IT, WHAT

02:17:10.789 --> 02:17:14.626
DOES THE Y 14 WHY NOT JUST

02:17:14.693 --> 02:17:19.431
DOUBLE IT TO LIKE 6 OR 7. SO

02:17:19.497 --> 02:17:21.199
YEAH WHAT WHAT'S BEHIND THAT.

02:17:21.266 --> 02:17:23.335
YOU KNOW, AND I THINK THAT WE'VE

02:17:23.401 --> 02:17:24.836
TALKED ABOUT NUMBERS. WE KNOW

02:17:24.903 --> 02:17:26.104
THAT THIS ENTIRE PROCESS OF

02:17:26.171 --> 02:17:27.606
EVICTION OR FORECLOSURE AND SO

02:17:27.672 --> 02:17:29.574
FORTH TAKES A LOT OF TIME. IT

02:17:29.641 --> 02:17:32.043
TAKES A LOT OF MONEY, IT TAKES A

02:17:32.110 --> 02:17:32.677
LOT OF COURT CONVERSATIONS AND

02:17:32.744 --> 02:17:34.679
MUCH MORE. THE HONEST TRUTH IS

02:17:34.746 --> 02:17:35.814
THAT MOST OF THE NONPROFITS AND

02:17:35.880 --> 02:17:37.415
THE CITIES THAT WE TALK TO,

02:17:37.482 --> 02:17:38.216
INCLUDING MY OWN CITY OF

02:17:38.283 --> 02:17:39.718
HAYWARD, HAS STATED THAT THAT

02:17:39.784 --> 02:17:41.353
GIVES ROUGHLY ENOUGH TIME FOR

02:17:41.419 --> 02:17:42.787
BOTH THE NONPROFIT OR THE CITY

02:17:42.854 --> 02:17:44.990
TO BE ABLE TO GATHER FUNDS,

02:17:45.056 --> 02:17:45.557
UTILIZE THE FUNDS THAT ARE

02:17:45.624 --> 02:17:48.593
ALREADY GUARANTEED TO FOLKS THE

02:17:48.660 --> 02:17:49.761
PAPERWORK, YOU KNOW, PROVING

02:17:49.828 --> 02:17:51.062
THIS, GETTING THE FUNDS OUT TO

02:17:51.129 --> 02:17:53.198
THE PERSON AND TO THE HANDS OF

02:17:53.264 --> 02:17:55.333
THE LANDLORD. YOU KNOW, WE CAN

02:17:55.400 --> 02:17:56.468
SAY THAT A LOT OF THE NUMBERS

02:17:56.534 --> 02:17:58.169
THAT WE'RE PUTTING OUT, WHETHER

02:17:58.236 --> 02:17:59.838
IT'S THE FORECLOSURE OF THE

02:17:59.904 --> 02:18:00.705
SEVERAL MONTHS OR EVEN THE

02:18:00.772 --> 02:18:02.207
EVICTION PROCESS OR ALL

02:18:02.273 --> 02:18:03.375
ARBITRARY. RIGHT? IT'S ALL BASED

02:18:03.441 --> 02:18:05.310
ON TIMELINES OF WHETHER IT'S THE

02:18:05.377 --> 02:18:07.212
JUDGE, WHETHER IT'S THE DATE, SO

02:18:07.278 --> 02:18:09.414
FORTH. SO A LOT OF THIS CAN BE

02:18:09.481 --> 02:18:11.483
ARGUED THAT WAY, HOWEVER, BASED

02:18:11.549 --> 02:18:13.418
ON BEST PRACTICES AND FROM THOSE

02:18:13.485 --> 02:18:15.153
SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS THAT WE

02:18:15.220 --> 02:18:16.988
TALKED TO, THEY SAID THAT THIS

02:18:17.055 --> 02:18:19.424
IS REASONABLE. AND IF I COULD

02:18:19.491 --> 02:18:20.558
JUST ADD, I WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:18:20.625 --> 02:18:21.593
EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THAT.

02:18:21.660 --> 02:18:23.762
EXACTLY AS YOU'RE SAYING, THIS

02:18:23.828 --> 02:18:25.563
THREE VERSUS 14 DAYS IS THE

02:18:25.630 --> 02:18:27.666
WINDOW OF TIME BEFORE THE

02:18:27.732 --> 02:18:28.900
SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT FOR

02:18:28.967 --> 02:18:30.902
UNLAWFUL DETAINER ARE FILED. SO

02:18:30.969 --> 02:18:32.771
THE EXTENSION THAT THE COUPLE OF

02:18:32.837 --> 02:18:35.240
MONTHS THAT IT MIGHT TAKE IS

02:18:35.306 --> 02:18:36.408
ONCE THAT LAWSUIT HAS BEEN

02:18:36.474 --> 02:18:38.576
FILED. AND THAT DOES DEPEND ON

02:18:38.643 --> 02:18:40.145
EVERY JUDGE'S CALENDAR AND HOW

02:18:40.211 --> 02:18:42.113
THE COUNTY AND HAS ARRANGED

02:18:42.180 --> 02:18:43.982
THEIR UD PRACTICE. BUT WHAT

02:18:44.049 --> 02:18:45.717
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THE PRE

02:18:45.784 --> 02:18:48.253
FILING 14 DAYS, AND THAT IS

02:18:48.319 --> 02:18:51.556
WHERE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CURE IS

02:18:51.623 --> 02:18:53.391
SO IMPORTANT AND CAN ACTUALLY,

02:18:53.458 --> 02:18:55.527
AS WE SAY, MAKE MONEY FLOW TO

02:18:55.593 --> 02:18:57.295
THE LANDLORD AND ALSO

02:18:57.362 --> 02:18:58.463
DISINCENTIVIZE THE LANDLORDS

02:18:58.530 --> 02:19:00.565
FROM INCURRING ATTORNEY'S FEES.

02:19:00.632 --> 02:19:02.300
I MEAN, THE ATTORNEYS WHO ARE

02:19:02.367 --> 02:19:04.936
JUST FILING, FILING, FILING

02:19:05.003 --> 02:19:06.371
DOZENS AND DOZENS OF THESE

02:19:06.438 --> 02:19:07.806
LAWSUITS A DAY, YOU KNOW, EVERY

02:19:07.872 --> 02:19:10.308
DAY IS DAY FOR SOMEBODY. LET'S

02:19:10.375 --> 02:19:12.510
MAKE IT DAY 15 AND MAKE FEWER OF

02:19:12.577 --> 02:19:14.913
THEM. AND I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT,

02:19:14.979 --> 02:19:15.747
FOR EXAMPLE, IMAGINE YOU WERE A

02:19:15.814 --> 02:19:19.017
SENIOR LIVING IN OAKLAND IN A,

02:19:19.084 --> 02:19:21.786
YOU KNOW, EVEN IN HAYWARD, AND

02:19:21.853 --> 02:19:25.423
YOUR MAILBOX WAS BROKEN INTO AND

02:19:25.490 --> 02:19:26.825
YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY CHECK WAS

02:19:26.891 --> 02:19:29.961
STOLEN. RIGHT. AND YOU WERE

02:19:30.028 --> 02:19:31.629
CALLING THE OFFICE TO SAY, HEY,

02:19:31.696 --> 02:19:34.632
I DIDN'T RECEIVE IT. AND ONE

02:19:34.699 --> 02:19:37.202
DAY, TWO DAYS, THREE DAYS PASSES

02:19:37.268 --> 02:19:38.303
BY, BUT THEY NEED TO SEND YOU

02:19:38.369 --> 02:19:42.240
ANOTHER CHECK OR YOU ARE WORKING

02:19:42.307 --> 02:19:44.576
AND YOU KNOW, YOU WEREN'T ABLE

02:19:44.642 --> 02:19:45.677
TO WORK OR SOMETHING HAPPENED

02:19:45.744 --> 02:19:47.345
WITH YOUR JOB AND YOU NEED A

02:19:47.412 --> 02:19:50.648
LITTLE BIT MORE TIME. SO THERE

02:19:50.715 --> 02:19:52.150
ARE THINGS LIKE WAGE THEFT.

02:19:52.217 --> 02:19:53.384
THERE ARE THINGS LIKE MISSING

02:19:53.451 --> 02:19:55.687
CHECKS. THERE ARE THINGS LIKE

02:19:55.754 --> 02:19:57.822
CONFUSION AND MUCH MORE. AND

02:19:57.889 --> 02:20:00.525
AGAIN, 14 DAYS IS REASONABLE.

02:20:00.592 --> 02:20:02.127
IT'S NOT A LOT. IT'S NOT THE

02:20:02.193 --> 02:20:04.529
WHOLE MONTH. IT'S LESS THAN HALF

02:20:04.596 --> 02:20:06.531
THE MONTH EVEN. AND WE WERE JUST

02:20:06.598 --> 02:20:07.665
TRYING TO STRIKE A BALANCE. IF

02:20:07.732 --> 02:20:10.368
YOU WILL APPRECIATE THAT. SO I'M

02:20:10.435 --> 02:20:11.736
GOING TO VOTE FOR THE BILL

02:20:11.803 --> 02:20:13.671
TODAY. BUT I REALLY DO VIEW THIS

02:20:13.738 --> 02:20:15.406
AS A WORK IN PROGRESS. THANK

02:20:15.473 --> 02:20:17.475
YOU. I THINK IT NEEDS TO YEAH.

02:20:17.542 --> 02:20:21.246
FURTHER CONSIDERATION TIGHTENING

02:20:21.312 --> 02:20:24.082
IT UP. SO APPRECIATE IT THOUGH.

02:20:24.149 --> 02:20:28.686
THANKS. SO. OKAY SO I VERY MUCH

02:20:28.753 --> 02:20:30.889
APPRECIATE WHAT THE BILL IS

02:20:30.955 --> 02:20:33.057
TRYING TO DO. AND I WE WILL ALL

02:20:33.124 --> 02:20:34.526
STIPULATE IN THIS ROOM THAT

02:20:34.592 --> 02:20:38.096
THERE IS A HOUSING CRISIS. AND I

02:20:38.163 --> 02:20:39.564
DON'T THINK THAT CAN BE

02:20:39.631 --> 02:20:43.201
DISPUTED. BUT I HAVE HAD A

02:20:43.268 --> 02:20:44.969
COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR.

02:20:45.036 --> 02:20:46.371
BUT I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW WHY.

02:20:46.437 --> 02:20:48.206
I'M NOT CRAZY ABOUT THE BILL. SO

02:20:48.273 --> 02:20:50.675
LET ME JUST TELL YOU, I DON'T

02:20:50.742 --> 02:20:53.311
SEE LANDLORDS AS BANKS. I DON'T

02:20:53.378 --> 02:20:56.047
SEE THEM AS COLLECTING,

02:20:56.114 --> 02:20:57.615
COLLECTING SAVINGS DEPOSITS SUCH

02:20:57.682 --> 02:21:06.157
THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO. ALLOW

02:21:06.224 --> 02:21:07.392
SUCH A GREAT PERIOD OF TIME. I

02:21:07.458 --> 02:21:09.227
KNOW YOU DON'T THINK IT'S A

02:21:09.294 --> 02:21:10.461
GREAT PERIOD OF TIME, BUT I'LL

02:21:10.528 --> 02:21:13.264
TELL YOU ONE THING ON THE 15TH,

02:21:13.331 --> 02:21:15.166
IF I DON'T PAY MY MORTGAGE, IT'S

02:21:15.233 --> 02:21:17.335
A LATE FEE. AND SO TO MY

02:21:17.402 --> 02:21:19.437
COLLEAGUE, FROM MARIN'S POINT,

02:21:19.504 --> 02:21:21.306
THAT MEANS SOMETHING TO ME. AND

02:21:21.372 --> 02:21:23.374
I JUST WONDER WHY WE ARE

02:21:23.441 --> 02:21:25.977
SHIFTING TO THE LANDLORD. AND

02:21:26.044 --> 02:21:27.679
I'M NOT SURE THAT THEY'RE THE

02:21:27.745 --> 02:21:30.915
RIGHT SEGMENT THAT SHOULD BE IN

02:21:30.982 --> 02:21:34.586
THAT POSITION OF DAMAGING THEIR

02:21:34.652 --> 02:21:37.155
CREDIT IF THEY CAN'T PAY THE

02:21:37.222 --> 02:21:38.590
MORTGAGE. BECAUSE WHEN I BUMP UP

02:21:38.656 --> 02:21:40.758
AGAINST 14, IF IN FACT, THE

02:21:40.825 --> 02:21:44.295
TENANT ISN'T ABLE TO PAY, THEN

02:21:44.362 --> 02:21:46.464
I'M UP AGAINST IT. AND THIS IDEA

02:21:46.531 --> 02:21:47.398
THAT, WELL, YOU KNOW, BY THE

02:21:47.465 --> 02:21:48.967
TIME A FORECLOSURE HAPPENS AND

02:21:49.033 --> 02:21:50.335
DURING THE GREAT RECESSION, WE

02:21:50.401 --> 02:21:52.904
GAVE WE, WE ALLOWED PEOPLE A

02:21:52.971 --> 02:21:54.439
LONGER PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE

02:21:54.505 --> 02:21:57.075
BANKS FORECLOSE. THAT MAY BE,

02:21:57.141 --> 02:21:59.210
BUT IT'S STILL A RISK TO ME. SO

02:21:59.277 --> 02:22:01.646
OR WHEN I CONSIDER THAT THAT DRY

02:22:01.713 --> 02:22:03.081
CLEANER IN LONG BEACH WHO CAME

02:22:03.147 --> 02:22:04.883
TO THIS COUNTRY WITH NOTHING AND

02:22:04.949 --> 02:22:06.184
DOESN'T HAVE A PENSION AND HAS

02:22:06.251 --> 02:22:08.620
BEEN PAYING YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT

02:22:08.686 --> 02:22:09.487
AND STILL CONTINUES WITH A

02:22:09.554 --> 02:22:11.456
MORTGAGE ON THE RENTAL PROPERTY,

02:22:11.522 --> 02:22:12.924
THOSE ARE SOME VERY LEAN TIMES.

02:22:12.991 --> 02:22:14.626
AND SO WHEN I COMBINE THAT

02:22:14.692 --> 02:22:16.261
NUMBER ONE WITH THE PRACTICAL

02:22:16.327 --> 02:22:17.595
WORLD OF YES, YOU GET SERVED

02:22:17.662 --> 02:22:19.564
WITH YOUR THREE DAY NOTICE. AND

02:22:19.631 --> 02:22:21.633
WE HAVE SOMEBODY HERE FROM

02:22:21.699 --> 02:22:23.468
STANFORD WHO WORKS IN PUBLIC

02:22:23.534 --> 02:22:29.007
LAW. WE KNOW THAT. IT WOULD TAKE

02:22:29.073 --> 02:22:31.276
A LONG TIME TO GET A JUDGMENT.

02:22:31.342 --> 02:22:33.111
AND SO I CAN APPRECIATE

02:22:33.177 --> 02:22:34.612
SOMEBODY. YOU HAVE A VERY GOOD

02:22:34.679 --> 02:22:36.781
POINT. A TENANT DOESN'T WANT A

02:22:36.848 --> 02:22:38.149
JUDGMENT ON THEIR RECORD EITHER.

02:22:38.216 --> 02:22:40.418
AND BY THE WAY, I'M NO FAN OF

02:22:40.485 --> 02:22:41.419
PENALTIES. JUST SO YOU KNOW, IN

02:22:41.486 --> 02:22:43.955
MY MIND, IF IT'S COLLECTIBLE,

02:22:44.022 --> 02:22:45.323
WHICH I WILL STIPULATE MOST OF

02:22:45.390 --> 02:22:47.125
THE TIME IT'S NOT COLLECTIBLE.

02:22:47.191 --> 02:22:49.327
BUT IF IT IS, THAT JUST PUTS

02:22:49.394 --> 02:22:50.295
PEOPLE FURTHER BEHIND. SO I

02:22:50.361 --> 02:22:52.063
DON'T SEE PENALTIES NECESSARILY

02:22:52.130 --> 02:22:55.333
AS THE ANSWER EITHER. BUT THIS

02:22:55.400 --> 02:22:57.001
IDEA THAT YOU GOT TO BUMP UP

02:22:57.068 --> 02:22:58.403
AGAINST WHEN THE MORTGAGE IS

02:22:58.469 --> 02:23:00.505
DUE. BUT I ALSO FEEL LIKE IN IN

02:23:00.571 --> 02:23:02.240
THE REAL WORLD, A LOT OF TIMES

02:23:02.307 --> 02:23:04.776
THESE THINGS ARE RESOLVED WITHIN

02:23:04.842 --> 02:23:06.711
14 DAYS. EVEN IF AN UNLAWFUL

02:23:06.778 --> 02:23:09.047
DETAINER ACTION IS FILED. AND I

02:23:09.113 --> 02:23:11.316
KNOW MOST LANDLORDS THAT I KNOW

02:23:11.382 --> 02:23:12.784
IF YOU CAN ULTIMATELY GET THAT

02:23:12.850 --> 02:23:14.519
MONEY BY THE 14TH OR THE 20TH

02:23:14.585 --> 02:23:19.991
WHEN IT TAKES THE A NONPROFIT TO

02:23:20.058 --> 02:23:21.759
PROVIDE MONEY FOR SOMEBODY OR

02:23:21.826 --> 02:23:24.095
EVEN 25 DAYS, YOU'RE NOT GOING

02:23:24.162 --> 02:23:25.997
TO HAVE A JUDGMENT BEFORE THAT

02:23:26.064 --> 02:23:27.332
TIME. I MEAN, THERE'S NO HOLD

02:23:27.398 --> 02:23:28.333
ON. THERE'S NO QUESTION PENDING.

02:23:28.399 --> 02:23:30.234
I'M SORRY. GIVE ME A CHANCE TO

02:23:30.301 --> 02:23:32.203
BE HEARD. SO I'M I WANT TO TALK

02:23:32.270 --> 02:23:33.871
ABOUT NOT ONLY OUR LANDLORDS.

02:23:33.938 --> 02:23:35.707
I'M NOT SURE THEY SHOULD BE MADE

02:23:35.773 --> 02:23:37.542
BANKS. AND I DON'T SEE THEM AS

02:23:37.608 --> 02:23:38.176
COLLECTING DEPOSITS SUCH THAT

02:23:38.242 --> 02:23:41.679
THEY CAN HANDLE THAT. BUT ALSO I

02:23:41.746 --> 02:23:44.816
DON'T I DON'T REALLY I'VE

02:23:44.882 --> 02:23:46.284
OPERATED IN THE REAL WORLD. I'VE

02:23:46.351 --> 02:23:48.319
I'VE DEALT WITH LANDLORD TENANT

02:23:48.386 --> 02:23:50.088
CASES. I JUST DON'T SEE IT

02:23:50.154 --> 02:23:51.756
THERE. SO I'M NOT SURE THIS IS

02:23:51.823 --> 02:23:53.324
THE ANSWER. AND I DO FEEL LIKE

02:23:53.391 --> 02:23:56.828
MOST LANDLORDS WOULD NOT WANT A

02:23:56.894 --> 02:23:58.396
TURNOVER AND AN EMPTY TIME IN

02:23:58.463 --> 02:24:00.231
THE PROPERTY, BECAUSE THEN THAT

02:24:00.298 --> 02:24:03.134
DOESN'T BENEFIT ANYBODY. AND I

02:24:03.201 --> 02:24:04.302
APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BY

02:24:04.369 --> 02:24:05.236
ANECDOTES, BUT I'M LISTENING TO

02:24:05.303 --> 02:24:07.105
YOUR ANECDOTES. ANECDOTES. I'D

02:24:07.171 --> 02:24:09.374
LIKE YOU TO HEAR SOME OF MINE

02:24:09.440 --> 02:24:10.008
TOO, AND I APPRECIATE THE DATA

02:24:10.074 --> 02:24:12.176
IS HARD TO COME BY, BUT I YEAH,

02:24:12.243 --> 02:24:13.978
I SERVED ON MY LOCAL CITY

02:24:14.045 --> 02:24:15.113
COUNCIL, MY FAVORITE, MY

02:24:15.179 --> 02:24:17.048
FAVORITE PERSON THAT CAME TO

02:24:17.115 --> 02:24:18.383
TESTIFY WAS AS FOLLOWS I DON'T

02:24:18.449 --> 02:24:20.218
KNOW HIS NAME, BUT HE WAS AN OLD

02:24:20.284 --> 02:24:22.220
GUY AND HE CAME UP AND HE GOES,

02:24:22.286 --> 02:24:24.055
LISTEN, YOU SPEND 30 YEARS

02:24:24.122 --> 02:24:25.456
PAYING OFF A BUILDING AND YOU

02:24:25.523 --> 02:24:27.058
HOPE TO GOD IT'S PAID OFF BEFORE

02:24:27.125 --> 02:24:29.193
YOU DIED. AND THEN HE SAT DOWN

02:24:29.260 --> 02:24:31.262
AND THAT WAS IT, YOU KNOW. SO I

02:24:31.329 --> 02:24:33.431
BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES OF THIS

02:24:33.498 --> 02:24:34.265
ISSUE FOR A LONG TIME, AND I'M

02:24:34.332 --> 02:24:35.333
SENSITIVE TO WHAT TENANTS GO

02:24:35.400 --> 02:24:36.467
THROUGH. BUT PRACTICALLY

02:24:36.534 --> 02:24:37.268
SPEAKING, MOST LANDLORDS WANT TO

02:24:37.335 --> 02:24:40.371
WORK WITH THEIR TENANTS TO WORK

02:24:40.438 --> 02:24:41.706
SOMETHING OUT. BUT I JUST DON'T

02:24:41.773 --> 02:24:43.641
FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THE

02:24:43.708 --> 02:24:44.909
LANDLORDS CREDIT, WHETHER IT'S A

02:24:44.976 --> 02:24:46.911
BONA FIDE FULL FORECLOSURE OR A

02:24:46.978 --> 02:24:48.913
LATE PENALTY. I'M JUST NOT THERE

02:24:48.980 --> 02:24:50.782
AND I'M NOT THERE TO SHIFT IT.

02:24:50.848 --> 02:24:53.284
AND SO I DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO

02:24:53.351 --> 02:24:55.520
TELL YOU WHY I WASN'T GOING TO

02:24:55.586 --> 02:24:57.288
BE VOTING FOR THE BILL. BUT HAVE

02:24:57.355 --> 02:24:59.257
AT IT. I'M READY FOR YOU. THANK

02:24:59.323 --> 02:25:00.691
YOU, THANK YOU. SO, ASSEMBLY

02:25:00.758 --> 02:25:02.727
MEMBER PAPIN AND I LOVE EXCUSE

02:25:02.794 --> 02:25:04.862
ME, SENATOR, WE ENJOY EACH

02:25:04.929 --> 02:25:07.398
OTHER'S COMPANY. SO ONE, I DO

02:25:07.465 --> 02:25:11.502
JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT 46.41% OF

02:25:11.569 --> 02:25:13.004
UNLAWFUL DETAINERS ARE RESOLVED

02:25:13.071 --> 02:25:15.339
WITHIN 14 DAYS OF FILING, RIGHT?

02:25:15.406 --> 02:25:16.507
THAT IS ONE DATA THAT WE

02:25:16.574 --> 02:25:19.277
RECEIVED FROM THE COURTS THAT

02:25:19.343 --> 02:25:21.412
ARE REALLY IN THIS. SO AGAIN,

02:25:21.479 --> 02:25:23.748
THE REASON WHY WE CHOSE 14 IS

02:25:23.815 --> 02:25:25.183
BECAUSE IT WAS THE MOST

02:25:25.249 --> 02:25:27.151
REASONABLE AMONGST ALL

02:25:27.218 --> 02:25:28.853
STAKEHOLDERS, RIGHT? WE ARE NOT

02:25:28.920 --> 02:25:30.154
LOOKING TO PENALIZE THE SMALL

02:25:30.221 --> 02:25:32.023
MOM AND POP LANDLORD. AND I HAVE

02:25:32.090 --> 02:25:33.491
JOKED MANY TIMES WITH OUR

02:25:33.558 --> 02:25:35.726
CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION

02:25:35.793 --> 02:25:37.862
REPRESENTATIVE AND OTHERS THAT

02:25:37.929 --> 02:25:39.330
ONE DAY I HOPE THAT, YOU KNOW,

02:25:39.397 --> 02:25:41.432
WE CAN ALL EVENTUALLY OWN A

02:25:41.499 --> 02:25:42.967
BUILDING AND BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

02:25:43.034 --> 02:25:45.937
HOUSING TO OTHER FOLKS. HERE'S

02:25:46.003 --> 02:25:47.271
THE REALITY. ALSO, WHEN WE'RE

02:25:47.338 --> 02:25:49.307
TALKING ABOUT CORPORATE

02:25:49.373 --> 02:25:50.808
LANDLORDS, RIGHT, THAT OWN

02:25:50.875 --> 02:25:52.844
HUNDREDS OF UNITS, THEY ALSO

02:25:52.910 --> 02:25:54.345
HAVE A PROPERTY MANAGER THAT

02:25:54.412 --> 02:25:55.580
SOMETIMES IS VERY DIFFICULT TO

02:25:55.646 --> 02:25:57.682
GET A HOLD OF, TO BE ABLE TO

02:25:57.748 --> 02:25:59.917
TALK TO, TO BE ABLE TO SAY THESE

02:25:59.984 --> 02:26:00.918
THINGS AND HAVE THESE CONCERNS

02:26:00.985 --> 02:26:04.322
AND REALLY TALK ABOUT IT. NOW,

02:26:04.388 --> 02:26:07.859
THIS IS ONE OF THE CONCERNS.

02:26:07.925 --> 02:26:08.693
THAT IS THE BALANCING ACT.

02:26:08.759 --> 02:26:11.095
RIGHT? SO YOU HAVE ROUGHLY 90

02:26:11.162 --> 02:26:13.631
DAYS FOR A PROPERTY OWNER TO

02:26:13.698 --> 02:26:14.599
POTENTIALLY GO INTO A

02:26:14.665 --> 02:26:16.801
FORECLOSURE TO POTENTIALLY DO

02:26:16.868 --> 02:26:18.769
ANYTHING LIKE THAT. AND THREE

02:26:18.836 --> 02:26:24.275
DAYS FOR A RENTER. RIGHT. AND

02:26:24.342 --> 02:26:26.110
ANYBODY CAN SEE THE IMBALANCE

02:26:26.177 --> 02:26:29.580
THERE. AND SO YES, THIS BILL IS

02:26:29.647 --> 02:26:31.782
A WORK IN PROGRESS. THIS BILL

02:26:31.849 --> 02:26:33.651
DOES DESERVE SOME OF THE

02:26:33.718 --> 02:26:35.086
GUARDRAILS THAT WERE BROUGHT UP.

02:26:35.153 --> 02:26:36.854
AND I AM NOT OPPOSED TO THESE

02:26:36.921 --> 02:26:40.091
GUARDRAILS AT ALL. RIGHT. BUT I

02:26:40.158 --> 02:26:41.726
ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO

02:26:41.792 --> 02:26:43.261
KEEP PUSHING THIS FORWARD

02:26:43.327 --> 02:26:45.863
WITHOUT LETTING A BILL, YOU

02:26:45.930 --> 02:26:47.665
KNOW, JUST BE TANKED BECAUSE

02:26:47.732 --> 02:26:49.700
IT'S THERE'S SO MANY CONCERNS.

02:26:49.767 --> 02:26:51.402
AND WE'RE GOING TO, YOU KNOW,

02:26:51.469 --> 02:26:52.436
SPEAK IN, YOU KNOW, A UTOPIA OF

02:26:52.503 --> 02:26:54.138
WHAT SHOULD BE, BUT NEVER GET

02:26:54.205 --> 02:26:55.473
THERE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT DOING

02:26:55.540 --> 02:26:59.110
THE WORK TODAY. RIGHT. AND SO I

02:26:59.177 --> 02:27:00.311
ALSO BELIEVE THAT, YOU KNOW,

02:27:00.378 --> 02:27:02.146
WHEN PEOPLE ARE PAYING FOR THEIR

02:27:02.213 --> 02:27:03.948
BUILDING, ESPECIALLY OUR SENIOR

02:27:04.015 --> 02:27:05.316
POPULATION, THEY WANT SOME

02:27:05.383 --> 02:27:07.418
GUARANTEES. RIGHT? AND I THINK

02:27:07.485 --> 02:27:08.519
THE GUARANTEE THAT IS IF YOU

02:27:08.586 --> 02:27:11.055
DON'T PAY WITHIN THESE DAYS, YOU

02:27:11.122 --> 02:27:13.558
WILL GET EVICTED. AND WE ARE NOT

02:27:13.624 --> 02:27:16.527
HERE TO SUPPORT SQUATTERS. WE

02:27:16.594 --> 02:27:18.429
ARE NOT INTERESTED IN ANY OF

02:27:18.496 --> 02:27:19.664
THIS. BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF

02:27:19.730 --> 02:27:21.799
HARD WORKING PEOPLE THAT JUST

02:27:21.866 --> 02:27:23.568
WANT TO STAY HOUSED AND NEED A

02:27:23.634 --> 02:27:25.603
LITTLE BIT MORE TIME. AND THAT'S

02:27:25.670 --> 02:27:27.405
REALLY WHAT THE BILL IS ABOUT,

02:27:27.471 --> 02:27:28.639
IS MAKING SURE PEOPLE STAY

02:27:28.706 --> 02:27:30.041
HOUSED, HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY.

02:27:30.107 --> 02:27:32.376
THEY DON'T WANT TO BE OUT ON THE

02:27:32.443 --> 02:27:33.978
STREET. THEY DON'T WANT TO TELL

02:27:34.045 --> 02:27:35.213
THEIR KID, HEY, YOU HAVE TO

02:27:35.279 --> 02:27:37.481
SLEEP IN THE CAR. IF I EVEN OWN

02:27:37.548 --> 02:27:39.150
A CAR, RIGHT? THIS IS AGAIN,

02:27:39.217 --> 02:27:41.285
JUST PUTTING HUMANITY BACK IN

02:27:41.352 --> 02:27:43.454
SOMETHING THAT IS TALKED ABOUT

02:27:43.521 --> 02:27:46.257
WITHOUT ANY HUMAN IMPACTS BEING

02:27:46.324 --> 02:27:47.692
DISCUSSED. AND THAT'S THE

02:27:47.758 --> 02:27:49.527
REALITY. OUR FASTEST GROWING

02:27:49.594 --> 02:27:51.195
HOMELESS POPULATION IS OUR

02:27:51.262 --> 02:27:53.664
SENIOR POPULATION, AND THE DATA

02:27:53.731 --> 02:27:55.566
IS NOT THERE WHEN WE'RE TALKING

02:27:55.633 --> 02:27:57.034
ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE REALLY

02:27:57.101 --> 02:27:58.936
LIVING NOW IN MULTIGENERATIONAL

02:27:59.003 --> 02:27:59.971
HOUSEHOLDS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T

02:28:00.037 --> 02:28:02.773
AFFORD RENT, PERIOD. RIGHT. AND

02:28:02.840 --> 02:28:04.442
SO I REALLY JUST WANT PEOPLE TO

02:28:04.508 --> 02:28:06.477
BRING THE HUMAN ASPECT BACK INTO

02:28:06.544 --> 02:28:08.312
IT. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A

02:28:08.379 --> 02:28:10.481
BUSINESS ASPECT INTO IT, AND I

02:28:10.548 --> 02:28:12.283
WANT TO RESPECT THAT, BUT I ALSO

02:28:12.350 --> 02:28:14.051
WANT TO STRIKE A BALANCE. AND

02:28:14.118 --> 02:28:17.655
THERE HAS NOT BEEN ANY STRONG

02:28:17.722 --> 02:28:19.757
LEGISLATION THAT HAS REALLY

02:28:19.824 --> 02:28:21.058
IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE NEEDS

02:28:21.125 --> 02:28:23.461
THAT RENTERS ALSO REQUIRE. AS

02:28:23.527 --> 02:28:25.496
SHE STATED, EVEN THE THREE DAYS

02:28:25.563 --> 02:28:28.366
IS NEARLY 100 YEARS OLD, RIGHT?

02:28:28.432 --> 02:28:31.402
WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO HELP

02:28:31.469 --> 02:28:33.170
PEOPLE TODAY AND IN TODAY'S TIME

02:28:33.237 --> 02:28:35.172
AND KEEP PEOPLE HOUSED. THAT IS

02:28:35.239 --> 02:28:39.176
ALL I'M ASKING FOR. THANK YOU,

02:28:39.243 --> 02:28:43.547
SENATOR ZIMMER. SO FIRST OF ALL,

02:28:43.614 --> 02:28:44.482
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. AS YOU

02:28:44.548 --> 02:28:46.584
KNOW, I'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH

02:28:46.651 --> 02:28:50.021
THIS BILL. YOU KNOW, I, YOU

02:28:50.087 --> 02:28:53.691
KNOW, APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT

02:28:53.758 --> 02:28:56.894
MANY, MANY, MANY FOLKS THAT ARE

02:28:56.961 --> 02:28:58.696
IN HOUSING NOW ARE STRUGGLING

02:28:58.763 --> 02:29:02.300
WITH PAYING THE RENT. THAT'S A

02:29:02.366 --> 02:29:06.737
THAT'S DUE TO POVERTY AND NEAR

02:29:06.804 --> 02:29:10.641
POVERTY IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND

02:29:10.708 --> 02:29:12.376
THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS

02:29:12.443 --> 02:29:14.478
OBVIOUSLY TO TRY TO KEEP AS MANY

02:29:14.545 --> 02:29:16.414
PEOPLE HOUSED FOR AS LONG AS

02:29:16.480 --> 02:29:17.815
POSSIBLE. AND I THINK THAT'S A

02:29:17.882 --> 02:29:19.817
LAUDABLE GOAL. THE REASON WHY

02:29:19.884 --> 02:29:21.786
I'VE BEEN STRUGGLING SO MUCH IS

02:29:21.852 --> 02:29:23.321
THAT, YOU KNOW, IT REALLY WASN'T

02:29:23.387 --> 02:29:24.755
UNTIL ABOUT 2 OR 3 YEARS AGO

02:29:24.822 --> 02:29:26.424
THAT I SORT OF VIEWED SOME OF

02:29:26.490 --> 02:29:28.526
THESE LANDLORD TENANT SORT OF

02:29:28.592 --> 02:29:30.361
ISSUES THAT COME BEFORE US

02:29:30.428 --> 02:29:35.800
THROUGH THE LENS OF, OF SMALL

02:29:35.866 --> 02:29:37.201
LANDLORDS. AND THE REASON FOR

02:29:37.268 --> 02:29:39.136
THAT IS BECAUSE AND I HAVEN'T

02:29:39.203 --> 02:29:41.539
SHARED THIS BEFORE, IS I HAVE A

02:29:41.605 --> 02:29:42.139
BROTHER WHO HAS STRUGGLED ALL

02:29:42.206 --> 02:29:44.475
HIS LIFE. MY MOM, BEFORE SHE

02:29:44.542 --> 02:29:46.243
PASSED AWAY, BOUGHT HIM A SMALL

02:29:46.310 --> 02:29:47.445
THREE UNIT APARTMENT BUILDING

02:29:47.511 --> 02:29:49.113
BECAUSE SHE KNEW THAT HE DIDN'T

02:29:49.180 --> 02:29:50.414
WOULDN'T HAVE A WAY TO SUPPORT

02:29:50.481 --> 02:29:57.355
HIMSELF, AND HE USES THE RENT ON

02:29:57.421 --> 02:30:00.358
THOSE OTHER TWO UNITS TO PAY ALL

02:30:00.424 --> 02:30:02.793
THE EXPENSES AND HIS LIVING

02:30:02.860 --> 02:30:04.695
EXPENSES. AND IF HE ACTUALLY

02:30:04.762 --> 02:30:07.298
LOSES A MONTH OF EVEN ONE MONTH

02:30:07.365 --> 02:30:10.434
OF RENT, IT PUTS HIM IN

02:30:10.501 --> 02:30:12.503
SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL HARDSHIP.

02:30:12.570 --> 02:30:16.307
AND SO, YOU KNOW WHAT THIS BILL

02:30:16.374 --> 02:30:18.676
MAKES ME WORRIED ABOUT IS THE

02:30:18.743 --> 02:30:21.278
FACT THAT FOR FOLKS LIKE. AND I

02:30:21.345 --> 02:30:23.681
DON'T THINK THAT WHILE HE MAY BE

02:30:23.748 --> 02:30:26.917
AT ONE END OF THE RANGE OF

02:30:26.984 --> 02:30:29.120
LANDLORDS, I DON'T THINK THAT

02:30:29.186 --> 02:30:31.522
MANY SMALL LANDLORDS ARE.

02:30:31.589 --> 02:30:32.823
THERE'S A LOT OF SMALL LANDLORDS

02:30:32.890 --> 02:30:34.225
THAT ARE NOT THAT FAR AWAY FROM

02:30:34.291 --> 02:30:37.328
THEM. YEAH. AND SO THAT'S WHEN

02:30:37.395 --> 02:30:40.197
WE GO DOWN THESE PATHS. I'D LIKE

02:30:40.264 --> 02:30:41.932
US TO BE LOOKING AT THIS MORE

02:30:41.999 --> 02:30:44.235
FROM BOTH PERSPECTIVES. I THINK

02:30:44.301 --> 02:30:46.670
WE FORGET ABOUT LOOKING AT IT

02:30:46.737 --> 02:30:48.239
FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THESE

02:30:48.305 --> 02:30:49.707
SMALL LANDLORDS, AND I'M NERVOUS

02:30:49.774 --> 02:30:51.742
THAT THIS HASN'T HIT THAT

02:30:51.809 --> 02:30:55.379
BALANCE. I'M NERVOUS THAT FOR

02:30:55.446 --> 02:30:57.615
FOLKS JUST LIKE WE HAVE GREAT

02:30:57.681 --> 02:30:58.582
LANDLORDS WHO I THINK WANT TO

02:30:58.649 --> 02:31:00.418
KEEP TENANTS IN THEIR BUILDINGS

02:31:00.484 --> 02:31:02.186
AND WOULD WORK WITH THEM. AND WE

02:31:02.253 --> 02:31:03.554
ALSO HAVE OTHER LANDLORDS THAT

02:31:03.621 --> 02:31:05.856
HAVE BAD MOTIVES FOR NOT WANTING

02:31:05.923 --> 02:31:07.691
TENANTS IN THEIR BUILDINGS. WE

02:31:07.758 --> 02:31:09.560
ALSO HAVE TENANTS, AND I DON'T

02:31:09.627 --> 02:31:11.362
THINK THEY'RE THE FOLKS THAT ARE

02:31:11.429 --> 02:31:12.663
LIVING IN POVERTY, BUT WE ALSO

02:31:12.730 --> 02:31:14.131
HAVE TENANTS THAT ARE GOING TO

02:31:14.198 --> 02:31:16.867
GAME SYSTEMS TOO. AND SO I WORRY

02:31:16.934 --> 02:31:18.469
ABOUT THE CASE WHERE WE HAVE A

02:31:18.536 --> 02:31:20.337
LOT OF FOLKS OUT THERE THAT NOW

02:31:20.404 --> 02:31:21.505
JUST THINK THAT THEY'VE GOT AN

02:31:21.572 --> 02:31:23.307
ADDITIONAL 14 DAYS TO NOT PAY

02:31:23.374 --> 02:31:25.576
THE RENT. AND HOW WE DEAL WITH

02:31:25.643 --> 02:31:28.512
THAT AND WHAT THAT HAS. AND IF

02:31:28.579 --> 02:31:30.281
YOU LOOK AT THE EQUITY OF

02:31:30.347 --> 02:31:32.483
PARTICULAR CASES, THEY STILL

02:31:32.550 --> 02:31:35.019
COULD RESULT IN INEQUITIES

02:31:35.085 --> 02:31:37.054
BETWEEN THOSE FOLKS THAT ARE

02:31:37.121 --> 02:31:38.422
JUST NOT THAT HAVE THE CAPACITY

02:31:38.489 --> 02:31:40.724
TO PAY THEIR RENT TO SOMEONE WHO

02:31:40.791 --> 02:31:42.159
REALLY NEEDS THE RENT AND

02:31:42.226 --> 02:31:43.360
THEY'RE NOT GETTING PAID THAT.

02:31:43.427 --> 02:31:45.062
SO THAT'S WHY I'VE HAD SO MUCH

02:31:45.129 --> 02:31:47.164
OF A PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL,

02:31:47.231 --> 02:31:48.098
BECAUSE I WANT TO JUST BLEND

02:31:48.165 --> 02:31:50.000
THAT WITH YOU. AND I HAVE BEEN

02:31:50.067 --> 02:31:51.669
COMMUNICATING WITH YOU ABOUT IT.

02:31:51.735 --> 02:31:53.037
I AM GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL

02:31:53.103 --> 02:31:54.939
TODAY TO GIVE YOU TIME TO WORK

02:31:55.005 --> 02:31:59.143
SOME OF THESE THINGS OUT. I. I

02:31:59.210 --> 02:32:01.645
HOPE YOU WILL LOOK AT IT FROM

02:32:01.712 --> 02:32:02.146
THE PERSPECTIVE REALLY

02:32:02.213 --> 02:32:03.247
CAREFULLY, FROM THE PERSPECTIVE

02:32:03.314 --> 02:32:05.649
OF A OF A LANDLORD THAT IS

02:32:05.716 --> 02:32:07.184
ACTUALLY STRUGGLING AND RELIES

02:32:07.251 --> 02:32:09.520
ON THE RENT TO PAY THEIR

02:32:09.587 --> 02:32:11.689
EXPENSES AND THEIR MORTGAGE. AND

02:32:11.755 --> 02:32:13.457
ALSO FROM THE PERSPECTIVE THAT I

02:32:13.524 --> 02:32:15.426
THINK, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU LOOK

02:32:15.493 --> 02:32:17.361
AT WHEN YOU MAKE THE COMPARISONS

02:32:17.428 --> 02:32:18.662
TO HAVING HELP FOR FOLKS WITH

02:32:18.729 --> 02:32:20.998
THEIR MORTGAGES, YOU KNOW, THAT

02:32:21.065 --> 02:32:23.534
SORT OF THE PERSON ON THE

02:32:23.601 --> 02:32:25.336
FINANCING END IS A LARGE

02:32:25.402 --> 02:32:26.670
FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. YEAH.

02:32:26.737 --> 02:32:27.905
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, IN

02:32:27.972 --> 02:32:29.406
THIS CASE, THE PERSON ON THE

02:32:29.473 --> 02:32:31.008
FINANCING END SOMETIMES IS A MOM

02:32:31.075 --> 02:32:32.276
AND POP OR SOMEONE LIKE MY

02:32:32.343 --> 02:32:35.079
BROTHER. YEAH. AND SO I GUESS

02:32:35.145 --> 02:32:36.614
I'D SORT OF SAY I'M NOT

02:32:36.680 --> 02:32:37.548
CONVINCED THAT THE 14 DAYS IS

02:32:37.615 --> 02:32:40.184
THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF TIME. I'M

02:32:40.251 --> 02:32:41.418
NOT GOING TO PRESCRIBE

02:32:41.485 --> 02:32:43.420
SOMETHING, BUT I'D LIKE YOU TO

02:32:43.487 --> 02:32:45.155
LOOK AT THAT. I'D LIKE YOU TO

02:32:45.222 --> 02:32:46.190
LOOK AT ISSUES LIKE REPEATED USE

02:32:46.257 --> 02:32:48.592
OF THIS SO THAT IT DOESN'T

02:32:48.659 --> 02:32:49.226
BECOME SOMETHING THAT IS USED

02:32:49.293 --> 02:32:52.596
EVERY MONTH AND JUST, YOU KNOW,

02:32:52.663 --> 02:32:55.332
AND I'D LIKE YOU TO SORT OF WORK

02:32:55.399 --> 02:32:56.667
WITH, YOU KNOW, WORK CLOSELY

02:32:56.734 --> 02:32:59.169
WITH, WITH REAL LANDLORDS AND

02:32:59.236 --> 02:33:02.373
TRY TO UNDERSTAND SORT OF THEIR

02:33:02.439 --> 02:33:03.874
PERSPECTIVE AS IT MOVES FORWARD.

02:33:03.941 --> 02:33:08.512
SO WITH THAT. I'M SUPPORTING

02:33:08.579 --> 02:33:10.381
TODAY, I WILL ALLOW YOU TO

02:33:10.447 --> 02:33:12.116
DEFINITELY. AND, AND I, I, I

02:33:12.182 --> 02:33:14.618
REALLY APPRECIATE AGAIN ALL THE

02:33:14.685 --> 02:33:15.753
CONVERSATION THAT WE'VE HAD ON

02:33:15.819 --> 02:33:18.389
THIS. AND I REALLY MEAN THAT

02:33:18.455 --> 02:33:20.190
BECAUSE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

02:33:20.257 --> 02:33:22.893
ISSUE FOR ME. THE GOAL OF THE

02:33:22.960 --> 02:33:24.728
BILLS THAT I REALLY BRING

02:33:24.795 --> 02:33:26.430
FORWARD IS NOT TO HARM ANYBODY.

02:33:26.497 --> 02:33:28.265
IT TRULY ISN'T, INCLUDING THE

02:33:28.332 --> 02:33:29.667
LANDLORDS. AND I'VE HAD MANY

02:33:29.733 --> 02:33:30.935
CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR

02:33:31.001 --> 02:33:34.572
COLLEAGUES HERE. I DON'T WANT TO

02:33:34.638 --> 02:33:35.906
INCENTIVIZE ANYBODY GAMING THE

02:33:35.973 --> 02:33:37.708
SYSTEM THAT THAT IS THE HONEST

02:33:37.775 --> 02:33:40.277
TRUTH. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE

02:33:40.344 --> 02:33:42.346
DEEPLY FOCUSED ON. AND I DO

02:33:42.413 --> 02:33:44.548
BELIEVE THAT MOST TENANTS DO NOT

02:33:44.615 --> 02:33:45.816
WANT TO RISK HAVING AN EVICTION

02:33:45.883 --> 02:33:47.117
ON THEIR RECORD, BECAUSE IT WILL

02:33:47.184 --> 02:33:48.485
PREVENT THEM FROM ACCESSING

02:33:48.552 --> 02:33:52.056
FUTURE RENTAL PROPERTIES. AND I

02:33:52.122 --> 02:33:55.125
ALSO THINK THAT MOST LANDLORDS

02:33:55.192 --> 02:33:56.961
WANT TO KEEP THE PROPERTY FILLED

02:33:57.027 --> 02:33:58.596
WITH SOMEBODY WHO IS PAYING

02:33:58.662 --> 02:34:01.832
THEIR RENT. I AM COMMITTED TO

02:34:01.899 --> 02:34:03.133
HAVING FURTHER CONVERSATIONS,

02:34:03.200 --> 02:34:05.336
BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT WE PUT

02:34:05.402 --> 02:34:07.938
IN SAFEGUARDS TO A ONE TIME

02:34:08.005 --> 02:34:10.140
EFFORT TO MAKING SURE THAT WE

02:34:10.207 --> 02:34:12.343
ARE TAKING CARE OF SOME OF THE

02:34:12.409 --> 02:34:13.277
GUARDRAILS REGARDING

02:34:13.344 --> 02:34:14.778
COMMERCIALS, PROPERTIES, AND

02:34:14.845 --> 02:34:16.447
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE

02:34:16.513 --> 02:34:17.982
TALKED ABOUT ALREADY. SO I KNOW

02:34:18.048 --> 02:34:20.150
THAT THIS IS A DIFFICULT BILL,

02:34:20.217 --> 02:34:22.419
BUT IT IS TRULY THE RIGHT THING

02:34:22.486 --> 02:34:23.354
TO DO TO HELP THE MAJORITY OF

02:34:23.420 --> 02:34:25.255
THE POPULATION THAT REALLY

02:34:25.322 --> 02:34:26.724
AREN'T ABLE TO COME HERE AND

02:34:26.790 --> 02:34:27.758
ADVOCATE FOR THEMSELVES. THESE

02:34:27.825 --> 02:34:30.194
ARE PEOPLE THAT TRULY JUST

02:34:30.260 --> 02:34:31.662
DESERVE A CHANCE. AND I THINK A

02:34:31.729 --> 02:34:33.497
COUPLE OF DAYS DOESN'T HURT

02:34:33.564 --> 02:34:36.367
ANYBODY. SO ANY OTHER QUESTIONS

02:34:36.433 --> 02:34:40.004
OR COMMENTS? I, YOU KNOW, I

02:34:40.070 --> 02:34:42.072
THINK ONE OF THE LEAST FORGOTTEN

02:34:42.139 --> 02:34:43.574
GROUPS IN THIS BUILDING ARE

02:34:43.641 --> 02:34:44.742
SMALL LANDLORDS. WE HEAR ABOUT

02:34:44.808 --> 02:34:46.210
SMALL LANDLORDS MORE THAN ALMOST

02:34:46.276 --> 02:34:49.480
ANY OTHER GROUP. AND IN FACT, IN

02:34:49.546 --> 02:34:50.948
CONVERSATION, IN PASSING, FOLKS

02:34:51.015 --> 02:34:52.916
SAY I GET AS TOUGH AS RENTERS,

02:34:52.983 --> 02:34:55.152
BUT THE SMALL THEN AS WELL AS A

02:34:55.219 --> 02:34:56.754
FAMILY. AND I KNOW I'VE SAID

02:34:56.820 --> 02:34:58.422
THIS A THOUSAND TIMES, THAT IS A

02:34:58.489 --> 02:34:59.723
SMALL MOM AND POP LANDLORD, OR

02:34:59.790 --> 02:35:03.627
MY FATHER IS A LANDLORD. I

02:35:03.694 --> 02:35:05.963
UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S LIKE WHEN

02:35:06.030 --> 02:35:08.198
PROPERTIES ARE LEFT IN DISREPAIR

02:35:08.265 --> 02:35:09.967
OR SOMEONE JUMPS OUT ON THE

02:35:10.034 --> 02:35:12.503
RENT. I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT A

02:35:12.569 --> 02:35:14.672
LOT OF THE PROPERTIES,

02:35:14.738 --> 02:35:15.606
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE YOUNGER

02:35:15.673 --> 02:35:16.707
GENERATION, THEY CANNOT AFFORD

02:35:16.774 --> 02:35:18.542
TO BUY HOMES. THEY'RE RENTERS

02:35:18.609 --> 02:35:20.377
BECAUSE A LOT OF THOSE IN THE

02:35:20.444 --> 02:35:22.179
PREVIOUS GENERATIONS WERE ABLE

02:35:22.246 --> 02:35:23.414
TO BUY HOMES 30, 40, 50 PLUS

02:35:23.480 --> 02:35:26.316
YEARS AGO THAT ARE COMPLETELY

02:35:26.383 --> 02:35:28.018
UNAFFORDABLE NOW. WAS THAT THEIR

02:35:28.085 --> 02:35:29.753
FAULT THEY WERE ABLE TO DO THAT?

02:35:29.820 --> 02:35:30.587
ABSOLUTELY NOT. IS IT THEIR

02:35:30.654 --> 02:35:32.489
FAULT THAT THEY NOW CAN RENT

02:35:32.556 --> 02:35:33.991
THOSE PROPERTIES OUT FOR A

02:35:34.058 --> 02:35:34.892
HANDSOME SUM? ABSOLUTELY NOT.

02:35:34.958 --> 02:35:36.293
BUT THAT'S THE REALITY OF THE

02:35:36.360 --> 02:35:38.328
SITUATION WE'RE IN. YOU KNOW, I

02:35:38.395 --> 02:35:40.130
DON'T BELIEVE LANDLORDS ARE

02:35:40.197 --> 02:35:41.498
BANKS. I ALSO DON'T BELIEVE THAT

02:35:41.565 --> 02:35:42.599
TENANTS ARE PROFIT CENTERS.

02:35:42.666 --> 02:35:44.902
THESE CONTRACTS ARE NOT NORMAL

02:35:44.968 --> 02:35:46.236
CONTRACTS. THESE CONTRACTS ARE

02:35:46.303 --> 02:35:48.372
GIVING SOMEONE A HOME, A ROOF

02:35:48.439 --> 02:35:50.507
OVER THEIR HEAD. WE CANNOT TREAT

02:35:50.574 --> 02:35:52.776
THEM IN THE SAME MANNER AS WE DO

02:35:52.843 --> 02:35:54.611
OTHER CONTRACTS, BECAUSE WE'RE

02:35:54.678 --> 02:35:57.748
IN A HOUSING CRISIS. WE'RE NOT

02:35:57.815 --> 02:35:59.049
JUST IN A HOUSE, WE'RE IN A

02:35:59.116 --> 02:36:00.751
RENTERS CRISIS. A REPORT JUST

02:36:00.818 --> 02:36:02.052
LAST MONTH FROM CONSUMER AFFAIRS

02:36:02.119 --> 02:36:03.854
SAYS CALIFORNIA IS THE WORST

02:36:03.921 --> 02:36:06.690
STATE IN THE NATION FOR RENTERS.

02:36:06.757 --> 02:36:08.258
AND THIS IS TALKING ABOUT WHEN

02:36:08.325 --> 02:36:10.327
THE I GET THE PROCESS. LIKE I

02:36:10.394 --> 02:36:12.296
SAID, MY FATHER'S HAD TO GET

02:36:12.362 --> 02:36:13.597
LAWYERS AND GO THROUGH THAT

02:36:13.664 --> 02:36:15.065
PROCESS. I KNOW IT CAN TAKE

02:36:15.132 --> 02:36:16.166
SEVERAL WEEKS. THIS HAS TO DO

02:36:16.233 --> 02:36:17.301
WHEN THE PROCESS IS TRIGGERED.

02:36:17.367 --> 02:36:19.002
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT EXTRA

02:36:19.069 --> 02:36:20.838
11 DAYS THAT ACTUALLY ALLOWS THE

02:36:20.904 --> 02:36:22.306
PROBLEM TO BE RESOLVED BEFORE

02:36:22.372 --> 02:36:24.108
YOU EVEN GET TO THAT PROCESS,

02:36:24.174 --> 02:36:26.110
WHICH IS TO EVERYONE'S BENEFIT.

02:36:26.176 --> 02:36:28.011
I LIKE SOME OF THE COMMENTS IN

02:36:28.078 --> 02:36:29.847
TERMS OF REPEAT USAGE OF IT. YOU

02:36:29.913 --> 02:36:30.981
KNOW, IF SOMEONE'S TAKING

02:36:31.048 --> 02:36:33.450
ADVANTAGE OF IT, IT'S NOT ABOUT

02:36:33.517 --> 02:36:34.051
GAMING THE SYSTEM. IF SOMEONE

02:36:34.118 --> 02:36:35.385
TEARS APART A HOME, THEY'RE NOT

02:36:35.452 --> 02:36:37.254
GOING TO CARE IF IT'S THREE

02:36:37.321 --> 02:36:38.188
DAYS, THREE HOURS OR 30 DAYS.

02:36:38.255 --> 02:36:39.389
THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE JUST

02:36:39.456 --> 02:36:41.992
NOT GOING TO BUY. WE'RE NOT

02:36:42.059 --> 02:36:42.626
TALKING ABOUT THOSE SITUATIONS

02:36:42.693 --> 02:36:44.161
BECAUSE THE LAW CLEARLY STATES

02:36:44.228 --> 02:36:45.863
THAT THOSE ARE THINGS THAT YOU

02:36:45.929 --> 02:36:46.497
CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT, EVEN IF

02:36:46.563 --> 02:36:48.532
IT TAKES A WHILE TO GET TO A

02:36:48.599 --> 02:36:50.300
RESOLUTION. 55% OF RENTERS IN

02:36:50.367 --> 02:36:52.102
CALIFORNIA ARE COST BURDEN, AND

02:36:52.169 --> 02:36:53.403
I THINK THAT NUMBER IS PRETTY

02:36:53.470 --> 02:36:55.439
LOW, ACTUALLY. I THINK IT'S MUCH

02:36:55.506 --> 02:36:56.507
HIGHER THAN THAT. BUT THAT'S

02:36:56.573 --> 02:36:59.276
RELATIVELY RECENT STUDIES, AND I

02:36:59.343 --> 02:37:02.146
GET IT'S TOUGH TO BE A LANDLORD

02:37:02.212 --> 02:37:03.881
AND IT CAN BE TOUGH, BUT THE

02:37:03.947 --> 02:37:05.115
RENTERS PROTECTIONS ARE THERE

02:37:05.182 --> 02:37:08.752
FOR A REASON. BECAUSE BECAUSE OF

02:37:08.819 --> 02:37:10.754
THE NATURE OF THE CONTRACT THAT

02:37:10.821 --> 02:37:11.455
EXISTS, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:37:11.522 --> 02:37:14.258
SOMEONE'S HOME. THE NUMBER ONE

02:37:14.324 --> 02:37:15.359
POPULATION ENTERING HOMELESSNESS

02:37:15.425 --> 02:37:18.395
ARE SENIORS. I JUST WISH THAT WE

02:37:18.462 --> 02:37:20.898
WOULD. AND I HAVE PLENTY OF

02:37:20.964 --> 02:37:22.466
ANECDOTES ON THE LANDLORD SIDE,

02:37:22.533 --> 02:37:23.834
BUT I ALSO REPRESENTED TENANTS

02:37:23.901 --> 02:37:25.769
IN LANDLORD TENANT COURT. AND TO

02:37:25.836 --> 02:37:27.070
EVERY ANECDOTE THERE IS FOR A

02:37:27.137 --> 02:37:29.139
LANDLORD, YOU CAN GIVE A

02:37:29.206 --> 02:37:30.040
THOUSAND HEARTBREAKING STORIES

02:37:30.107 --> 02:37:31.742
OF PEOPLE HAVING TO CARRY THEIR

02:37:31.809 --> 02:37:34.411
BABIES TO COURT, OR CAN'T EVEN

02:37:34.478 --> 02:37:36.113
MAKE IT TO COURT BECAUSE THEIR

02:37:36.180 --> 02:37:37.481
BOSS WON'T GIVE THEM THE DAY OFF

02:37:37.548 --> 02:37:39.817
TO GO TO COURT, AND SO THAT THEY

02:37:39.883 --> 02:37:41.218
GET A JUDGMENT AGAINST THEM.

02:37:41.285 --> 02:37:42.853
THESE EXTRA FEW DAYS GIVES THE

02:37:42.920 --> 02:37:44.254
FOLKS THAT ARE THE MOST

02:37:44.321 --> 02:37:46.089
VULNERABLE IN OUR STATE A

02:37:46.156 --> 02:37:48.625
LIFELINE, A BASIC 11 DAY

02:37:48.692 --> 02:37:50.527
LIFELINE TO TRY THEIR BEST TO

02:37:50.594 --> 02:37:51.895
MAKE IT RIGHT WITH THEIR

02:37:51.962 --> 02:37:53.730
LANDLORD, WHICH THEY WANT TO DO

02:37:53.797 --> 02:37:55.232
IF THEY DON'T WANT TO, THEY'RE

02:37:55.299 --> 02:37:56.466
GOING TO, WHETHER IT'S THREE

02:37:56.533 --> 02:37:58.468
DAYS OR 11 DAYS, 14 DAYS, THE

02:37:58.535 --> 02:37:59.403
EVICTION PROCESS IS GOING TO

02:37:59.469 --> 02:38:01.238
START. BUT FOR THOSE THAT REALLY

02:38:01.305 --> 02:38:03.507
MEANINGFULLY WANT TO THAT ARE

02:38:03.574 --> 02:38:05.275
WORKING TWO SHIFTS A DAY AND

02:38:05.342 --> 02:38:06.376
THAT THREE DAYS IS JUST NOT

02:38:06.443 --> 02:38:08.378
ENOUGH FOR THEM TO GET TO THAT

02:38:08.445 --> 02:38:09.413
NONPROFIT, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

02:38:09.479 --> 02:38:11.281
TALKING ABOUT HERE. WE'RE IN A

02:38:11.348 --> 02:38:12.516
HOUSING CRISIS. WE'RE IN A

02:38:12.583 --> 02:38:13.817
RENTERS CRISIS. WE'RE IN A

02:38:13.884 --> 02:38:15.219
HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. AND SO I

02:38:15.285 --> 02:38:16.220
JUST MENTIONED THAT BECAUSE WHEN

02:38:16.286 --> 02:38:19.223
I HEAR COMMENTS, ALL LEGITIMATE

02:38:19.289 --> 02:38:20.357
COMMENTS THAT EVERYBODY ON THIS

02:38:20.424 --> 02:38:22.459
DAY HAS MADE, I DON'T HEAR THE

02:38:22.526 --> 02:38:24.261
PLIGHT OF THE RENTER OTHER THAN

02:38:24.328 --> 02:38:26.430
FROM THE AUTHOR, NOT

02:38:26.496 --> 02:38:27.631
MEANINGFULLY NOT TALKING ABOUT

02:38:27.698 --> 02:38:29.366
THE ANECDOTES OF THE FOLKS IN

02:38:29.433 --> 02:38:31.134
YOUR DISTRICT, BECAUSE YOU KNOW

02:38:31.201 --> 02:38:32.336
WHAT? THEY DON'T SHOW UP TO YOUR

02:38:32.402 --> 02:38:34.338
COMMUNITY COFFEES. THEY DON'T

02:38:34.404 --> 02:38:39.376
HAVE TIME TO SEND LETTERS IN.

02:38:39.443 --> 02:38:41.311
THEY'RE TRYING TO SURVIVE. AND I

02:38:41.378 --> 02:38:43.313
THINK WE NEED TO ALSO HAVE THAT

02:38:43.380 --> 02:38:45.449
IN THE FRONT OF OUR MIND AS WE

02:38:45.515 --> 02:38:46.416
CONSIDER THESE KINDS OF POLICIES

02:38:46.483 --> 02:38:49.453
AS WELL. I HAVE AN AI

02:38:49.519 --> 02:38:51.388
RECOMMENDATION. WOULD YOU LIKE

02:38:51.455 --> 02:38:55.259
TO CLOSE? THANK YOU. I. I

02:38:55.325 --> 02:38:57.327
COULDN'T AGREE MORE THAN WHAT

02:38:57.394 --> 02:38:59.129
THE CHAIR JUST STATED RIGHT NOW.

02:38:59.196 --> 02:39:01.832
AND I AM AND I WAS THE ONLY

02:39:01.899 --> 02:39:04.268
RENTER IN THE SENATE. I CHAIR

02:39:04.334 --> 02:39:07.504
HOUSING THE FACT THAT LANDLORD

02:39:07.571 --> 02:39:09.773
ISSUES WITH TENANTS ARE IN

02:39:09.840 --> 02:39:10.741
JUDICIARY AND NOT IN HOUSING IS

02:39:10.807 --> 02:39:12.342
A CONCERN OF MINE TOO, JUST IN

02:39:12.409 --> 02:39:14.378
THE WAY THAT WE STRUCTURE THIS

02:39:14.444 --> 02:39:17.214
AND TO THE CHAIR'S POINT. WE

02:39:17.281 --> 02:39:18.749
DON'T TALK ABOUT RENTERS AND

02:39:18.815 --> 02:39:20.751
THEIR CONCERNS ENOUGH, AND I

02:39:20.817 --> 02:39:21.551
UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A

02:39:21.618 --> 02:39:24.087
BUSINESS TRANSACTION, BUT I ALSO

02:39:24.154 --> 02:39:25.122
WANT TO HIGHLIGHT SOMETHING FOR

02:39:25.188 --> 02:39:26.790
YOU ALL TO JUST CONSIDER AND

02:39:26.857 --> 02:39:28.659
JUST SEE AGAIN THE DIFFERENCE.

02:39:28.725 --> 02:39:30.861
WHEN WE PURCHASE A CAR, WE KNOW

02:39:30.928 --> 02:39:33.030
WHAT OUR CONTRACT IS GOING TO BE

02:39:33.096 --> 02:39:34.364
FOR FIVE YEARS AND KNOW OUR

02:39:34.431 --> 02:39:35.399
MONTHLY PAYMENT EVERY SINGLE

02:39:35.465 --> 02:39:37.668
MONTH FOR THOSE FIVE YEARS, BUT

02:39:37.734 --> 02:39:42.105
MOST RENTAL CONTRACTS ARE FOR A

02:39:42.172 --> 02:39:44.975
YEAR, AND EACH YEAR IT GOES UP

02:39:45.042 --> 02:39:46.343
EVERY SINGLE YEAR. AND THAT'S

02:39:46.410 --> 02:39:47.744
YOUR HOUSING. THAT IS LITERALLY

02:39:47.811 --> 02:39:50.047
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR

02:39:50.113 --> 02:39:52.516
MOST FAMILIES UP AND DOWN THE

02:39:52.582 --> 02:39:53.583
STATE, REGARDLESS OF WHAT CITY

02:39:53.650 --> 02:39:56.019
YOU BELONG TO, HOUSING AND

02:39:56.086 --> 02:39:58.622
HOMELESSNESS ARE THE NUMBER ONE

02:39:58.689 --> 02:40:01.091
ISSUES THAT ALL PEOPLE RATE IN

02:40:01.158 --> 02:40:03.527
THEIR POLLS. AND YET WE HAVE

02:40:03.593 --> 02:40:05.028
SOMETHING BEFORE US THAT, YES,

02:40:05.095 --> 02:40:06.897
DOESN'T SOLVE THE HOUSING

02:40:06.964 --> 02:40:08.565
CRISIS, DOESN'T SOLVE THE

02:40:08.632 --> 02:40:11.501
RENTERS ISSUES, BUT IT HELPS. IT

02:40:11.568 --> 02:40:13.303
HELPS IN A VERY MEANINGFUL WAY.

02:40:13.370 --> 02:40:16.306
AND I ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE TO

02:40:16.373 --> 02:40:18.041

BILL ALONG TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT.

GUYS HAVE RAISED TODAY, AND THAT

02:40:23.547 --> 02:40:25.349
WE HAVE ALSO THOUGHT ABOUT

02:40:25.415 --> 02:40:27.451
OURSELVES AND BRINGING THIS

02:40:27.517 --> 02:40:29.186
FORWARD TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

02:40:29.252 --> 02:40:32.189
PROTECTING LITERALLY MILLIONS OF

02:40:32.255 --> 02:40:33.523
CALIFORNIANS THAT ARE NOT IN

02:40:33.590 --> 02:40:34.658

SB 580 ENHANCES THE ATTORNEY

02:42:01.211 --> 02:42:03.013
GENERAL'S OFFICE MODEL, POLICIES

02:42:03.080 --> 02:42:04.581
AND DATA BASED GUIDELINES FOR

02:42:04.648 --> 02:42:06.383
STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES

02:42:06.450 --> 02:42:08.151
REGARDING CIVIL IMMIGRATION

02:42:08.218 --> 02:42:09.953
ENFORCEMENT. OVER 10 MILLION

02:42:10.020 --> 02:42:11.388
IMMIGRANTS LIVE IN CALIFORNIA,

02:42:11.455 --> 02:42:12.856
AND THEY CONTRIBUTE

02:42:12.923 --> 02:42:14.591
SIGNIFICANTLY TO OUR STATE.

02:42:14.658 --> 02:42:16.493
HOWEVER, THERE IS A THREAT OF

02:42:16.560 --> 02:42:18.528
CIVIL IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT,

02:42:18.595 --> 02:42:20.497
WHICH CREATES WIDESPREAD FEAR

02:42:20.564 --> 02:42:22.632
AND INSTABILITY IN OUR

02:42:22.699 --> 02:42:23.967
COMMUNITIES, ARE FORCED TO WEIGH

02:42:24.034 --> 02:42:25.869
DAILY DECISIONS, LIKE WHETHER

IN THIS ROLE, I INTERACT WITH A

02:43:59.696 --> 02:44:01.464
DIVERSE POPULATION. WE SCREEN

02:44:01.531 --> 02:44:03.466
AND RECORD EVERYONE WHO COMES TO

02:44:03.533 --> 02:44:04.301
THE HOSPITAL, BUT THERE ARE

02:44:04.367 --> 02:44:06.136
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO DO NOT

02:44:06.203 --> 02:44:07.837
SPEAK ENGLISH AND ARE OFTEN

02:44:07.904 --> 02:44:09.673

MEDICAL NEEDS, THESE INDIVIDUALS

02:44:12.976 --> 02:44:14.244
ARE MORE CONCERNED THAT WE WILL

02:44:14.311 --> 02:44:15.645
SHARE THEIR INFORMATION WITH ICE

02:44:15.712 --> 02:44:17.614

OUR HOSPITAL DATABASES, AND I AM

02:44:28.658 --> 02:44:29.826
KNOWS WHAT TO DO. IF ICE

02:44:29.893 --> 02:44:32.829

02:44:37.200 --> 02:44:38.935
TURNED OVER TO ICE AGENTS.

02:44:39.002 --> 02:44:40.403
PUBLIC AGENCIES EXIST TO HELP

02:44:40.470 --> 02:44:42.505
THE PEOPLE, NOT TO HELP ICE FIND

02:44:42.572 --> 02:44:44.207

02:47:44.053 --> 02:47:45.121
THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT AND

02:47:45.188 --> 02:47:47.657
COLLEAGUES HERE TO PRESENT SB

02:47:47.724 --> 02:47:51.194
709 LOOKING TO DO A FIRST IN THE

02:47:51.261 --> 02:47:53.863
IN THE STATE KIND OF APPROACH TO

02:47:53.930 --> 02:47:56.599
TRY TO RELEASE REAL IN SOME OF

02:47:56.666 --> 02:47:58.968
THE DECEPTIVE LOW RATES THAT ARE

02:47:59.035 --> 02:48:00.870
GRABBING CUSTOMERS INTO

02:48:00.937 --> 02:48:03.139
SELF-STORAGE UNITS BEFORE THEIR

02:48:03.206 --> 02:48:05.341
RATES ARE RAISED 30 TO 40% AND

02:48:05.408 --> 02:48:08.812
THEN ANOTHER 10 TO 15%. THIS

02:48:08.878 --> 02:48:09.712
BILL HAS BEEN DRASTICALLY

02:48:09.779 --> 02:48:11.414
REDUCED. AND TO COMMENT TO THE

02:48:11.481 --> 02:48:13.183
ANALYSIS IS THAT IS THIS GOING

02:48:13.249 --> 02:48:15.285
TO BENEFIT CUSTOMERS, CONSUMERS?

02:48:15.351 --> 02:48:16.820
IN FACT, THE FIRST ITERATION OF

02:48:16.886 --> 02:48:18.288
THE BILL REALLY WOULD HAVE

02:48:18.354 --> 02:48:19.589
DRASTICALLY IMPACTED CONSUMERS

02:48:19.656 --> 02:48:21.124
AS WE WERE LOOKING TO CAP THE

02:48:21.191 --> 02:48:23.993
RENT. BUT WHAT YOU SEE NOW IS

02:48:24.060 --> 02:48:25.128
SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT, BUT

02:48:25.195 --> 02:48:26.830
IT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT

02:48:26.896 --> 02:48:28.264
DIRECTION, BECAUSE EVEN MYSELF

02:48:28.331 --> 02:48:30.099
HERE HAVE HAD TO RENT A

02:48:30.166 --> 02:48:31.334
SELF-STORAGE. WE MOVE IN AND OUT

02:48:31.401 --> 02:48:33.403
OF OUR APARTMENTS ALL THE TIME.

02:48:33.470 --> 02:48:34.204
WE'RE GOING BACK HOME. WE DON'T

02:48:34.270 --> 02:48:36.606
WANT TO PAY DURING THE TIME THAT

02:48:36.673 --> 02:48:37.774
WE'RE NOT HERE, DURING THE FALL,

02:48:37.841 --> 02:48:39.275
INTERIM AND SO FORTH. AND DURING

02:48:39.342 --> 02:48:41.244
THE TIME THAT I HAD MY

02:48:41.311 --> 02:48:42.045
SELF-STORAGE FROM AROUND THE

02:48:42.111 --> 02:48:44.314
CORNER, MY RENT WAS RAISED 33%

02:48:44.380 --> 02:48:46.816
IN A MATTER OF SIX MONTHS FOR

02:48:46.883 --> 02:48:48.718
LESS THAN SIX MONTHS. THAT'S A

02:48:48.785 --> 02:48:50.954
DRASTIC HIKE. WE ARE MIDDLE

02:48:51.020 --> 02:48:53.189
INCOME EARNERS HERE. IMAGINE AN

02:48:53.256 --> 02:48:54.491
INDIVIDUAL THAT DOESN'T HAVE OUR

02:48:54.557 --> 02:48:56.392
SALARY. WHAT KIND OF AN INCREASE

02:48:56.459 --> 02:48:58.561
THAT COULD BE TO THEM? SO WE

02:48:58.628 --> 02:49:00.129
WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT, YES.

02:49:00.196 --> 02:49:01.965
MAYBE YOU WERE LURED IN ON $1 A

02:49:02.031 --> 02:49:02.565
MONTH. WE RECOGNIZE WE'RE NOT

02:49:02.632 --> 02:49:04.300
NAIVE THAT THAT'S NOT GOING TO

02:49:04.367 --> 02:49:06.135
BE OUR RENT FOR THE REST OF OUR

02:49:06.202 --> 02:49:08.171
OUR TIME WITH THE CONTRACT. BUT

02:49:08.238 --> 02:49:09.706
WE WANT TO KNOW HOW HIGH IS THE

02:49:09.772 --> 02:49:12.308
RENT ACTUALLY GOING TO BE. SO WE

02:49:12.375 --> 02:49:13.243
WANT CONTRACTS TO ACTUALLY PUT

02:49:13.309 --> 02:49:14.377
THE MAXIMUM RENTAL HIKE THAT

02:49:14.444 --> 02:49:15.245
COULD BE CHANGED DURING THE

02:49:15.311 --> 02:49:16.579
FIRST 12 MONTHS, WHETHER THE

02:49:16.646 --> 02:49:18.181
RENTAL RATE IS SUBJECT TO

02:49:18.248 --> 02:49:19.482
CHANGE, THE DURATION OF THE

02:49:19.549 --> 02:49:20.850
PROMOTIONAL PRICING, HOW THE

02:49:20.917 --> 02:49:22.185
CONSUMER CAN TERMINATE THE

02:49:22.252 --> 02:49:23.386
RENTAL AGREEMENT, AND ON A

02:49:23.453 --> 02:49:25.188
DIFFERENT PAGE, THE OWNER'S

02:49:25.255 --> 02:49:26.356
CONTACT INFORMATION. BEEN

02:49:26.422 --> 02:49:27.757
WORKING REALLY HARD WITH THE

02:49:27.824 --> 02:49:28.992
OPPOSITION. I KNOW WE HAVEN'T

02:49:29.058 --> 02:49:30.660
GOTTEN TO ALL THEIR CONCERNS,

02:49:30.727 --> 02:49:31.661
BUT I WANT TO ADDRESS THOSE

02:49:31.728 --> 02:49:33.596
RIGHT NOW. YOU'RE HEARING FROM

02:49:33.663 --> 02:49:36.332
THE OPPOSITION THAT AN AVERAGE

02:49:36.399 --> 02:49:38.201
RENTER, THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF A

02:49:38.268 --> 02:49:40.270
RENT OF A SELF-STORAGE IS MERELY

02:49:40.336 --> 02:49:42.071
SIX MONTHS. I TO THE DAY. I

02:49:42.138 --> 02:49:43.940
DON'T KNOW IF THE COMMITTEE HAS

02:49:44.007 --> 02:49:46.142
HAVEN'T RECEIVED ANY PROOF TO

02:49:46.209 --> 02:49:48.945
THAT NUMBER, BUT I HAVE. I CAN

02:49:49.012 --> 02:49:51.681
SUBMIT THREE AT MINIMUM THREE

02:49:51.748 --> 02:49:53.516
RESOURCES THAT SHOW AN AVERAGE

02:49:53.583 --> 02:49:56.786
RENT LENGTH OF TEN MONTHS, 14

02:49:56.853 --> 02:49:58.321
MONTHS AND TWO YEARS,

02:49:58.388 --> 02:49:59.389
RESPECTIVELY, FROM THREE

02:49:59.455 --> 02:50:01.157
DIFFERENT RESOURCES. IN FACT, IF

02:50:01.224 --> 02:50:02.458
YOU ALL WERE TO GOOGLE RIGHT

02:50:02.525 --> 02:50:04.093
NOW, THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF A

02:50:04.160 --> 02:50:05.862
RENTER OF A SELF-STORAGE, I

02:50:05.929 --> 02:50:08.464
WOULD TELL YOU 14 MONTHS THERE'S

02:50:08.531 --> 02:50:09.432
ACTUAL PROOF TO THE NUMBERS THAT

02:50:09.499 --> 02:50:11.267
I'M PRESENTING TO YOU

02:50:11.334 --> 02:50:12.468
COLLEAGUES, AND I HAVEN'T SEEN

02:50:12.535 --> 02:50:14.470
ANY DATA OR REPORT TO SAY THAT

02:50:14.537 --> 02:50:17.674
AN AVERAGE LENGTH IS SIX MONTHS.

02:50:17.740 --> 02:50:18.808
ADDITIONALLY, WHAT ABOUT THE

02:50:18.875 --> 02:50:22.512
ABILITY FOR THE COMPANIES TO

02:50:22.579 --> 02:50:24.514
PREDICT THE MARKET RATE? WELL,

02:50:24.581 --> 02:50:26.282
THEY'RE ABLE TO PREDICT THEIR

02:50:26.349 --> 02:50:29.986
GROWTH NOW. IN FACT, ACCORDING

02:50:30.053 --> 02:50:32.088
TO STORE ORGANIZE COM WHICH

02:50:32.155 --> 02:50:33.590
TRACKS THE WHOLE ENTIRE

02:50:33.656 --> 02:50:36.092
SELF-STORAGE INDUSTRY, THEY ARE

02:50:36.159 --> 02:50:37.560
PROJECTING THAT THEIR MARKET IS

02:50:37.627 --> 02:50:41.230
GOING TO STEADILY INCREASE 5.91%

02:50:41.297 --> 02:50:43.666
ALL THE WAY UP TO 2034. SO IF

02:50:43.733 --> 02:50:45.335
THEY CAN PREDICT HOW MUCH THEIR

02:50:45.401 --> 02:50:47.370
MARKET IS GOING TO INCREASE UP

02:50:47.437 --> 02:50:50.506
UNTIL 2034, AND THEIR CAN

02:50:50.573 --> 02:50:52.241
REFLECT THAT TO IMPACT THEIR

02:50:52.308 --> 02:50:54.811
RATES, WHY IS IT SO HARD TO

02:50:54.877 --> 02:50:57.647
PREDICT THE RATE UP TO 12 MONTHS?

02:50:57.714 --> 02:50:59.782
AGAIN, BRINGING SOME DATA TO THE

02:50:59.849 --> 02:51:01.250
CONVERSATION HERE THAT WE CAN

02:51:01.317 --> 02:51:04.020
POINT TO THAT IS BACKING UP OUR

02:51:04.087 --> 02:51:06.656
CLAIMS OF 12 MONTHS IS A IS A

02:51:06.723 --> 02:51:10.660
JUSTIFIABLE ADJUSTABLE AMOUNT TO

02:51:10.727 --> 02:51:13.129
PREDICT. AND ALSO THEY HAVE THE

02:51:13.196 --> 02:51:14.864
ABILITY TO DO IT. AND LASTLY

02:51:14.931 --> 02:51:16.733
I'LL SAY WHAT ABOUT THE CONCERN

02:51:16.799 --> 02:51:18.267
THAT IF THEY CAN'T PREDICT IT,

02:51:18.334 --> 02:51:19.936
THEY'RE JUST GOING TO INFLATE

02:51:20.003 --> 02:51:21.471
THE NUMBERS? WELL, TO THAT I

02:51:21.537 --> 02:51:23.239
WOULD SAY, ISN'T THAT THE

02:51:23.306 --> 02:51:24.107
PROBLEM WITHIN ITSELF THAT THAT

02:51:24.173 --> 02:51:25.375
THEY HAVE ABILITY TO JUST

02:51:25.441 --> 02:51:26.843
INFLATE WHENEVER THEY WANT

02:51:26.909 --> 02:51:28.177
WITHOUT HAVING NUMBERS TO BACK

02:51:28.244 --> 02:51:29.779
UP THE REASONS WHY THEY NEED TO

02:51:29.846 --> 02:51:31.147
INFLATE IT? THAT'S A BIGGER

02:51:31.214 --> 02:51:33.316
QUESTION THAT WE SHOULD LOOK TO

02:51:33.383 --> 02:51:35.518
ADDRESS LATER ON. LISTEN,

02:51:35.585 --> 02:51:37.220
MILITARY MEMBERS, 1.2 MILLION

02:51:37.286 --> 02:51:38.688
MILITARY VETERANS USE SELF

02:51:38.755 --> 02:51:40.823
STORAGE UNITS. INDIVIDUALS WHO

02:51:40.890 --> 02:51:43.026
ARE COMING OUT OF COLLEGE, GOING

02:51:43.092 --> 02:51:44.460
TO COLLEGE. I'VE HAD TO USE A

02:51:44.527 --> 02:51:46.362
SELF STORAGE THREE TIMES IN MY

02:51:46.429 --> 02:51:48.297
LIFE, AND THE FIRST TIME IT WAS

02:51:48.364 --> 02:51:49.532
BECAUSE OUR FAMILY GOT EVICTED

02:51:49.599 --> 02:51:50.466
FROM OUR HOME. THE SECOND TIME

02:51:50.533 --> 02:51:53.202
IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS COMING BACK

02:51:53.269 --> 02:51:54.303
OR BOTH COMING BACK AND GOING TO

02:51:54.370 --> 02:51:56.205
THE MILITARY WHERE I WAS GOING

02:51:56.272 --> 02:51:57.273
TO PUT MY PLACE, MY THINGS. AND

02:51:57.340 --> 02:51:59.575
NOW FOR THE FINAL TIME IS

02:51:59.642 --> 02:52:00.576
BECAUSE AS A LEGISLATOR, I DON'T

02:52:00.643 --> 02:52:02.311
WANT TO PAY FOR THE TIME. WE'RE

02:52:02.378 --> 02:52:04.414
NOT HERE. THESE STORIES ARE VERY

02:52:04.480 --> 02:52:05.481
SIMILAR TO SO MANY INDIVIDUALS

02:52:05.548 --> 02:52:07.083
THAT NEED A PLACE TO PUT THEIR

02:52:07.150 --> 02:52:08.251
STUFF. WHEN THEIR LIFE GETS A

02:52:08.317 --> 02:52:09.986
LITTLE DIFFICULT, WE JUST WANT

02:52:10.053 --> 02:52:11.187
TO BRING THEM A LITTLE BIT MORE

02:52:11.254 --> 02:52:13.056
OF UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THEY'RE

02:52:13.122 --> 02:52:14.691
GOING TO HAVE TO PAY. IF THIS

02:52:14.757 --> 02:52:16.526
REALLY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING FOR

02:52:16.592 --> 02:52:17.160
THE CONSUMER, THEN THE

02:52:17.226 --> 02:52:18.261
OPPOSITION WOULDN'T BE FIGHTING

02:52:18.327 --> 02:52:19.762
THIS BILL. BUT IT ACTUALLY DOES

02:52:19.829 --> 02:52:21.197
SOMETHING. AND I THINK

02:52:21.264 --> 02:52:23.032
TRANSPARENCY IS ALWAYS GOOD FOR

02:52:23.099 --> 02:52:25.568
EVERYBODY. WITH THAT, MR. CHAIR,

02:52:25.635 --> 02:52:27.170
I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO MY

02:52:27.236 --> 02:52:29.205
TWO KEY WITNESSES. GOOD MORNING,

02:52:29.272 --> 02:52:30.173
MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS,

02:52:30.239 --> 02:52:31.641
CHRISTOPHER SANCHEZ WITH THE

02:52:31.708 --> 02:52:33.176
GROUP HERE ON BEHALF OF THE

02:52:33.242 --> 02:52:34.711
SPONSOR OF THE CONSUMER

02:52:34.777 --> 02:52:35.645
FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA AND

02:52:35.712 --> 02:52:39.515
STRONG SUPPORT OF SB 709 2024

02:52:39.582 --> 02:52:41.084
REPORT REVEALED THAT ONE OF FIVE

02:52:41.150 --> 02:52:42.885
PEOPLE WHO RELY ON THE SELF

02:52:42.952 --> 02:52:43.820
STORAGE FOR VARIOUS REASONS,

02:52:43.886 --> 02:52:45.588
INCLUDING HOME RENOVATIONS,

02:52:45.655 --> 02:52:47.924
MOVING NATURAL DISASTERS, STATE

02:52:47.990 --> 02:52:49.959
OF EMERGENCIES, AND DOWNSIZING,

02:52:50.026 --> 02:52:52.128
AMONG OTHER THINGS. THE BIGGEST

02:52:52.195 --> 02:52:53.196
PROBLEM FACING CONSUMERS WHEN

02:52:53.262 --> 02:52:54.897
INTERACTING WITH THIS INDUSTRY

02:52:54.964 --> 02:52:56.199
IS ESSENTIALLY A BAIT AND SWITCH

02:52:56.265 --> 02:52:58.000
PROBLEM. WHEN CONSUMERS ARE

02:52:58.067 --> 02:52:59.936
PROVIDED A TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE

02:53:00.002 --> 02:53:01.437
DEAL, WHICH IS SOON FOLLOWED UP

02:53:01.504 --> 02:53:02.371
WITH A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE THAT

02:53:02.438 --> 02:53:04.774
COULD BE UP TO 300%. THIS

02:53:04.841 --> 02:53:06.209
PRACTICE IS COMMONLY KNOWN IN

02:53:06.275 --> 02:53:08.244
THE SELF STORAGE INDUSTRY AS THE

02:53:08.311 --> 02:53:10.079
EXISTING CONSUMER RATE INCREASE,

02:53:10.146 --> 02:53:11.414
WHICH ALLOWS FOR THESE COMPANIES

02:53:11.481 --> 02:53:13.416
TO PLACE CONSUMERS IN A

02:53:13.483 --> 02:53:14.550
SITUATION THAT TRAPS THEM INTO A

02:53:14.617 --> 02:53:16.519
PRICE THAT THEY'RE OFTEN LEADING

02:53:16.586 --> 02:53:18.121
THEM INTO TRYING TO BALANCE

02:53:18.187 --> 02:53:20.223
THEIR OWN PERSONAL FINANCES WITH

02:53:20.289 --> 02:53:22.425
THIS NEW, UNEXPECTED COST. ONE

02:53:22.492 --> 02:53:23.693
CASE WE WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT

02:53:23.760 --> 02:53:26.028
IS WHERE CONSUMER, WHO HAD A

02:53:26.095 --> 02:53:28.931
SIGNED CONTRACT FOR $45 RENTAL

02:53:28.998 --> 02:53:31.367
STORAGE UNIT, SAW HER INCREASE

02:53:31.434 --> 02:53:33.169
AFTER JUST TWO MONTHS, AND THEN

02:53:33.236 --> 02:53:34.670
AGAIN, ANOTHER INCREASE UNTIL

02:53:34.737 --> 02:53:36.773
HER MONTHLY RATE REACHED TO

02:53:36.839 --> 02:53:39.275
ABOUT $220. IN THIS CASE, WITH

02:53:39.342 --> 02:53:40.710
SIGNIFICANT INCREASES, SHE WAS

02:53:40.777 --> 02:53:42.812
FORCED TO BE. SHE WAS FORCED OUT

02:53:42.879 --> 02:53:45.181
BECAUSE SHE COULD NO LONGER TO

02:53:45.248 --> 02:53:46.716
AFFORD IT, FORCED OUT OF THE

02:53:46.783 --> 02:53:48.718
STORAGE UNIT. WITH THE AMOUNT OF

02:53:48.785 --> 02:53:49.418
CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE LIVING

02:53:49.485 --> 02:53:51.020
PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK AND ARE

02:53:51.087 --> 02:53:52.455
BARELY MAKING IT BY, WE WOULD,

02:53:52.522 --> 02:53:54.290
WE SHOULD ALL WANT TO ENSURE

02:53:54.357 --> 02:53:55.925
THAT CALIFORNIANS CONSUMERS ARE

02:53:55.992 --> 02:53:57.260
FULLY AWARE OF THE PRICES,

02:53:57.326 --> 02:53:58.728
ESPECIALLY IN MONTH LONG

02:53:58.795 --> 02:54:00.329
AGREEMENTS, SO THEY DON'T FALL

02:54:00.396 --> 02:54:01.597
VICTIM TO DEBT TRAPS THAT ARE

02:54:01.664 --> 02:54:04.167
WOULD MAKE THEM MAKE HORRIBLE

02:54:04.233 --> 02:54:05.334
DECISIONS FOR THEM OR THEIR

02:54:05.401 --> 02:54:07.603
FAMILIES. THAT'S WHY WE SUPPORT

02:54:07.670 --> 02:54:09.005
THIS BILL. AND FOR ALL THOSE

02:54:09.071 --> 02:54:10.840
REASONS, WE WOULD URGE YOUR

02:54:10.907 --> 02:54:11.908
VOTE. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING.

02:54:11.974 --> 02:54:13.843
MY NAME IS REBECCA GONZALEZ, AND

02:54:13.910 --> 02:54:15.311
I'M A POLICY ADVOCATE FOR THE

02:54:15.378 --> 02:54:16.746
WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND

02:54:16.813 --> 02:54:18.815
POVERTY. FOR OVER 55 YEARS, THE

02:54:18.881 --> 02:54:20.650
WESTERN CENTER HAS ADVOCATED ON

02:54:20.716 --> 02:54:22.118
BEHALF OF CALIFORNIANS

02:54:22.185 --> 02:54:23.920
EXPERIENCING POVERTY IN EVERY

02:54:23.986 --> 02:54:25.488
BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT, FROM THE

02:54:25.555 --> 02:54:26.956
COURTS TO THE LEGISLATURE,

02:54:27.023 --> 02:54:28.591
THROUGH THE LENS OF ECONOMIC AND

02:54:28.658 --> 02:54:30.560
RACIAL JUSTICE, WE LITIGATE,

02:54:30.626 --> 02:54:31.861
EDUCATE, AND ADVOCATE AROUND

02:54:31.928 --> 02:54:33.663
HOUSING, HEALTHCARE, AND PUBLIC

02:54:33.729 --> 02:54:36.265
BENEFITS AND ADMINISTRATION. WE

02:54:36.332 --> 02:54:37.266
SUPPORT THIS BILL AND WANT TO

02:54:37.333 --> 02:54:39.001
THANK THE AUTHOR FOR SHEDDING A

02:54:39.068 --> 02:54:40.770
SPOTLIGHT ON THE UNFAIR BUSINESS

02:54:40.837 --> 02:54:41.737
PRACTICES OF THIS INDUSTRY,

02:54:41.804 --> 02:54:44.106
WHICH IMPACTS PEOPLE IN POVERTY.

02:54:44.173 --> 02:54:46.642
A 2023 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE

02:54:46.709 --> 02:54:47.844
ARTICLE FOUND THAT A CONSUMER

02:54:47.910 --> 02:54:49.245
HAD RENTED A STORAGE UNIT FOR

02:54:49.312 --> 02:54:52.682
THE INITIAL RATE OF $197 A MONTH

02:54:52.748 --> 02:54:55.985
STARTING IN MAY 2018. RENT HIKES

02:54:56.052 --> 02:54:58.554
TO THE RENTAL UNIT WERE ADDED BY

02:54:58.621 --> 02:55:00.423
2023, RAISING THE RENT ON A NINE

02:55:00.489 --> 02:55:04.660
BY TEN FOOT UNIT TO $308, A 56%

02:55:04.727 --> 02:55:07.196
RATE INCREASE. DURING THAT SAME

02:55:07.263 --> 02:55:09.632
PERIOD, APARTMENT RENTS GREW 6%

02:55:09.699 --> 02:55:11.300
FOR STUDIOS AND ONE BEDROOMS,

02:55:11.367 --> 02:55:13.269
AND 9% FOR TWO BEDROOMS IN THE

02:55:13.336 --> 02:55:15.504
SAME AREA. THE GLOBAL SELF

02:55:15.571 --> 02:55:17.974
STORAGE MARKET IS VALUED AT 54

02:55:18.040 --> 02:55:19.775
BILLION AND PROJECTED TO

02:55:19.842 --> 02:55:23.246
INCREASE TO 83.6 BILLION IN

02:55:23.312 --> 02:55:25.147
2027, YET AGAIN ACCOUNTING THE

02:55:25.214 --> 02:55:26.916
THAT THE INDUSTRY IS MAINLY

02:55:26.983 --> 02:55:28.751
UNREGULATED, MEANING OWNERS CAN

02:55:28.818 --> 02:55:30.152
RAISE RATES TO WHATEVER THE

02:55:30.219 --> 02:55:32.622
MARKET CAN BEAR. CALIFORNIA ONLY

02:55:32.688 --> 02:55:34.156
REGULATES SELF STORAGE RENTAL

02:55:34.223 --> 02:55:36.092
FEES DURING A LOCAL STATE OF

02:55:36.158 --> 02:55:37.727
EMERGENCY, WHEN THEY ARE SUBJECT

02:55:37.793 --> 02:55:39.462
TO ANTI-GOUGING 10% CAP ON PRICE

02:55:39.528 --> 02:55:40.997
INCREASES FOR GOODS AND

02:55:41.063 --> 02:55:42.665
SERVICES. WE ARE INCREASINGLY

02:55:42.732 --> 02:55:44.300
LEARNING THAT THE UNHOUSED

02:55:44.367 --> 02:55:45.268
POPULATION IS STORING THEIR

02:55:45.334 --> 02:55:47.036
PERSONAL BELONGINGS. IMPORTANT

02:55:47.103 --> 02:55:49.238
DOCUMENTS SUCH AS THEIR DRIVER'S

02:55:49.305 --> 02:55:51.073

PAY, THEIR BELONGINGS ARE BEING

02:55:57.813 --> 02:55:59.348
SOLD OFF AND THEY CANNOT

02:55:59.415 --> 02:56:02.184
RECOVER. DOCTOR MARCO KUSHEL,

INITIATIVE, STATED THAT STORAGE

02:56:07.757 --> 02:56:09.091
PROBLEMS OFTEN COME UP IN

02:56:09.158 --> 02:56:10.126
INTERVIEWS, WITH MANY POINTING

02:56:10.192 --> 02:56:12.194
TO THE LOSS OF PERTINENT

02:56:12.261 --> 02:56:13.429
DOCUMENTATION THAT HAS KEPT THEM

02:56:13.496 --> 02:56:15.197
FROM SECURING HOUSING. THE

02:56:15.264 --> 02:56:16.632
BUSINESS PRACTICES OF THIS

02:56:16.699 --> 02:56:17.934

02:56:51.867 --> 02:57:08.017
THANK YOU.

02:57:11.854 --> 02:57:13.122
GOOD MORNING, MR. CHAIRMAN, AND

02:57:13.189 --> 02:57:14.390
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY

02:57:14.457 --> 02:57:15.992

ASSOCIATION IN ALEXANDRIA,

02:57:18.427 --> 02:57:20.296
VIRGINIA. WE ARE IN RESPECTFUL

02:57:20.363 --> 02:57:21.664
OPPOSITION UNLESS AMEND POSITION

02:57:21.731 --> 02:57:24.367
ON THIS BILL. WE APPRECIATE

02:57:24.433 --> 02:57:25.801
WORKING WITH SENATOR MENGIBAR TO

02:57:25.868 --> 02:57:27.603
ADDRESS MANY OF OUR CONCERNS. WE

02:57:27.670 --> 02:57:29.805
BELIEVE THAT BY AND LARGE,

02:57:29.872 --> 02:57:31.941
SENATE BILL 709, AS CURRENTLY IN

02:57:32.008 --> 02:57:33.376
PRINT, LANDS IN THE RIGHT PLACE

02:57:33.442 --> 02:57:34.877
BY ADDING DISCLOSURES SIMILAR TO

02:57:34.944 --> 02:57:36.879
THOSE IN THE AUTO RENEWAL LAW.

02:57:36.946 --> 02:57:38.681
WE ARE FULLY IN FAVOR OF

02:57:38.748 --> 02:57:40.483
TRANSPARENCY TO ENSURE THAT THE

02:57:40.549 --> 02:57:41.984
INDUSTRY HAS CONSISTENT

02:57:42.051 --> 02:57:43.719
PRACTICES AROUND PRICING AND

02:57:43.786 --> 02:57:45.154
PRICING DISCLOSURE TO THE

02:57:45.221 --> 02:57:47.089
CONSUMER. BUT WE DO HAVE THE ONE

02:57:47.156 --> 02:57:48.758
REMAINING CONCERN WITH OUR BILL

02:57:48.824 --> 02:57:51.160
ON THE DISCLOSURE OF THE MAXIMUM

02:57:51.227 --> 02:57:53.796
AMOUNT THAT THE TENANT COULD PAY

02:57:53.863 --> 02:57:56.332
AT 12 MONTHS. WE WOULD LIKE TO

02:57:56.399 --> 02:57:58.200
SEE THAT FIGURE AT SIX MONTHS,

02:57:58.267 --> 02:58:00.302
BUT I WILL GET BACK TO THAT AND

02:58:00.369 --> 02:58:01.670
LARGELY DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE

02:58:01.737 --> 02:58:03.639
HERE TO EXPLAIN OUR POSITION ON

02:58:03.706 --> 02:58:05.474
THAT. BUT I JUST WANT TO PROVIDE

02:58:05.541 --> 02:58:06.475
SOME ADDITIONAL INDUSTRY

02:58:06.542 --> 02:58:08.911
BACKGROUND. THE INDUSTRY HAS

02:58:08.978 --> 02:58:10.413
FLEXIBLE MONTH TO MONTH

02:58:10.479 --> 02:58:12.415
CONTRACTS THAT THE CONSUMER CAN

02:58:12.481 --> 02:58:14.417
USE, ALLOWING THE CONSUMER TO

02:58:14.483 --> 02:58:16.152
USE STORAGE FOR THE AMOUNT OF

02:58:16.218 --> 02:58:18.354
TIME THAT HE OR SHE NEEDS TO,

02:58:18.421 --> 02:58:21.524
AND THEN BASICALLY WALK AWAY

02:58:21.590 --> 02:58:23.793
WITH MINIMAL OR NO NOTICE WHEN

02:58:23.859 --> 02:58:26.262
THE CONSUMER'S NEED FOR

02:58:26.328 --> 02:58:28.030
SELF-STORAGE ENDS. THERE ARE NO

02:58:28.097 --> 02:58:29.465
CONSUMER CREDIT CHECKS IN SELF

02:58:29.532 --> 02:58:31.167
STORAGE. THERE ARE NO SECURITY

02:58:31.233 --> 02:58:32.635
DEPOSITS IN SELF STORAGE. IT'S

02:58:32.701 --> 02:58:34.870
MEANT TO BE AN EASY TO ACCESS

02:58:34.937 --> 02:58:36.439
REAL ESTATE PRODUCT FOR FOLKS

02:58:36.505 --> 02:58:38.207
WHO NEED IT, WHEN THEY NEED IT,

02:58:38.274 --> 02:58:40.409
AND THEN WHEN THEY NO LONGER

02:58:40.476 --> 02:58:41.977
NEED IT, THEY THEY NO LONGER

02:58:42.044 --> 02:58:43.145
NEED IT AND DON'T HAVE TO INCUR

02:58:43.212 --> 02:58:44.780
THE COST OF A LONG TERM

02:58:44.847 --> 02:58:46.649
AGREEMENT. I DO WANT TO ADDRESS

02:58:46.715 --> 02:58:48.617
THE SPECIFICALLY THE ISSUE OF

02:58:48.684 --> 02:58:50.820
THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF STAY. IT'S

02:58:50.886 --> 02:58:52.688
A QUESTION OF THE MEAN VERSUS

02:58:52.755 --> 02:58:55.024
THE MEDIAN. WE DO AGREE THAT THE

02:58:55.091 --> 02:58:56.592
AVERAGE LENGTH OF STAY FROM THE

02:58:56.659 --> 02:58:58.561
DATA WE'VE SEEN IS SIMILAR TO

02:58:58.627 --> 02:58:59.662
WHAT SENATOR MENGIBAR MENTIONED.

02:58:59.728 --> 02:59:02.164
IT'S AT 14 MONTHS, BUT THE

02:59:02.231 --> 02:59:04.834
MAJORITY OF CUSTOMERS RENT FOR

02:59:04.900 --> 02:59:07.670
SIX MONTHS OR LESS. IT'S THE

02:59:07.736 --> 02:59:09.438
TENANTS WHO THE CUSTOMERS WHO

02:59:09.505 --> 02:59:11.207
RENT FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF

02:59:11.273 --> 02:59:13.542
TIME SKEW THE FIGURE LONGER TO

02:59:13.609 --> 02:59:15.911
14 MONTHS. AND BECAUSE THE AND

02:59:15.978 --> 02:59:17.680
I'LL WRAP UP BECAUSE THE

02:59:17.746 --> 02:59:20.649
MAJORITY RENT FOR SIX MONTHS OR

02:59:20.716 --> 02:59:21.684
LESS, WE BELIEVE IT'S

02:59:21.750 --> 02:59:24.153
APPROPRIATE AND BENEFICIAL, MOST

02:59:24.220 --> 02:59:25.855
BENEFICIAL TO THOSE CONSUMERS TO

02:59:25.921 --> 02:59:27.389
HAVE A SIX MONTH DISCLOSURE

02:59:27.456 --> 02:59:29.158
RATHER THAN 12 MONTH DISCLOSURE.

02:59:29.225 --> 02:59:31.026
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. HI, I'M

02:59:31.093 --> 02:59:32.928
GARY SUGARMAN, CHAIRMAN OF THE

02:59:32.995 --> 02:59:33.896
CALIFORNIA SELF STORAGE

02:59:33.963 --> 02:59:35.598
ASSOCIATION. I'M ALSO A SELF

02:59:35.664 --> 02:59:37.833
STORAGE OWNER BASED IN SANTA

02:59:37.900 --> 02:59:39.835
MONICA, CALIFORNIA. THANKS FOR

02:59:39.902 --> 02:59:41.370
THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE

02:59:41.437 --> 02:59:43.405
TESTIMONY THIS MORNING REGARDING

02:59:43.472 --> 02:59:45.174
709. IT'S IMPORTANT TO CLEAR UP

02:59:45.241 --> 02:59:46.509
A COUPLE OF MISPERCEPTIONS THAT

02:59:46.575 --> 02:59:47.943
HAVE INFORMED THE DIALOG.

02:59:48.010 --> 02:59:49.612
HOWEVER, FIRST, SELF STORAGE HAS

02:59:49.678 --> 02:59:51.881
MOST CERTAINLY NOT BECOME LESS

02:59:51.947 --> 02:59:53.749
AFFORDABLE IN RECENT YEARS, AS

02:59:53.816 --> 02:59:55.818
HAS BEEN SUGGESTED. INDEED, THE

02:59:55.885 --> 02:59:57.786
OPPOSITE IS TRUE STORAGE PRICING

02:59:57.853 --> 02:59:59.088
HAS LAGGED INFLATION OVER THE

02:59:59.155 --> 03:00:00.890
PAST DECADE, AND THE AVERAGE

03:00:00.956 --> 03:00:02.358
RENT FOR STORAGE UNIT TODAY IS

03:00:02.424 --> 03:00:04.493
ACTUALLY CHEAPER THAN IT WAS TEN

03:00:04.560 --> 03:00:06.095
YEARS AGO, ADJUSTED FOR

03:00:06.162 --> 03:00:07.429
INFLATION. OUR POSITION,

03:00:07.496 --> 03:00:08.397
THEREFORE, CONTINUES TO BE THAT

03:00:08.464 --> 03:00:10.766
ANY PRICE CONTROL DISCUSSION FOR

03:00:10.833 --> 03:00:12.401
STORAGE IS MISPLACED AND

03:00:12.468 --> 03:00:14.136
INAPPROPRIATE. SECOND, PRICING

03:00:14.203 --> 03:00:15.971
PROMOTIONS NOW AND LOW

03:00:16.038 --> 03:00:17.806
INTRODUCTORY RATES ARE NOT

03:00:17.873 --> 03:00:19.875
INHERENTLY BAD THINGS, NOR

03:00:19.942 --> 03:00:21.610
NECESSARILY UNETHICAL. AS HAS

03:00:21.677 --> 03:00:23.546
BEEN SUGGESTED, MOST STORAGE

03:00:23.612 --> 03:00:25.347
CUSTOMERS ENJOY AND BENEFIT FROM

03:00:25.414 --> 03:00:27.183
THE LOW PRICES AND INCREDIBLE

03:00:27.249 --> 03:00:29.685
FLEXIBLE TERMS THAT OPERATORS

03:00:29.752 --> 03:00:31.487
PROVIDE. THE STORAGE INDUSTRY

03:00:31.554 --> 03:00:32.354
CONSISTENTLY DELIVERS BETTER

03:00:32.421 --> 03:00:34.590
THAN 98% SATISFACTION RATINGS

03:00:34.657 --> 03:00:37.259
FROM ITS CUSTOMERS. NONETHELESS,

03:00:37.326 --> 03:00:38.761
THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS

03:00:38.827 --> 03:00:41.764
PROPOSED BY 709 MAY SERVE TO

03:00:41.830 --> 03:00:44.166
INCENT OPERATORS TO BE EVEN MORE

03:00:44.233 --> 03:00:45.568
TRANSPARENT, WHICH IS A GOOD

03:00:45.634 --> 03:00:46.735
THING. HOWEVER, THE REQUIREMENT

03:00:46.802 --> 03:00:48.704
TO SET A 12 MONTH MAXIMUM PRICE

03:00:48.771 --> 03:00:50.172
UPFRONT VERSUS A SIX MONTH

03:00:50.239 --> 03:00:52.374
MAXIMUM, AS THE INDUSTRY HAS

03:00:52.441 --> 03:00:54.176
PROPOSED, WILL HURT THE VERY

03:00:54.243 --> 03:00:55.211
CUSTOMERS THE LEGISLATION

03:00:55.277 --> 03:00:57.012
INTENDS TO HELP BECAUSE THE

03:00:57.079 --> 03:00:58.614
MAJORITY OF STORAGE CUSTOMERS

03:00:58.681 --> 03:01:00.616
STAY FOR SIX MONTHS OR LESS,

03:01:00.683 --> 03:01:02.017
HAVING OPERATORS COMMIT TO A

03:01:02.084 --> 03:01:03.919
MAXIMUM PRICE ONE YEAR OUT

03:01:03.986 --> 03:01:05.321
FORCES THEM TO INCUR THE RISK

03:01:05.387 --> 03:01:07.189
THAT THEY'LL BE CAUGHT SHORT ONE

03:01:07.256 --> 03:01:08.624
YEAR DOWN THE ROAD, WITH UNDER

03:01:08.691 --> 03:01:10.826
MARKET PRICING, PROJECTING RATES

03:01:10.893 --> 03:01:12.661
ONE YEAR OUT IS WELL BEYOND THE

03:01:12.728 --> 03:01:14.330
PREDICTABLE HORIZON FOR STORAGE

03:01:14.396 --> 03:01:15.764
RATES, AND SO OPERATORS WILL

03:01:15.831 --> 03:01:17.199
NECESSARILY SET THESE MAXIMUM

03:01:17.266 --> 03:01:19.368
PRICES HIGH AND OTHERWISE

03:01:19.435 --> 03:01:21.237
COMPENSATE FOR THIS NEW RISK BY

03:01:21.303 --> 03:01:23.339
RAISING INTRODUCTORY RATES AND

03:01:23.405 --> 03:01:24.673
REDUCING THE ACCESS AND

03:01:24.740 --> 03:01:25.808
FLEXIBILITY THAT CUSTOMERS

03:01:25.874 --> 03:01:27.610
CURRENTLY ENJOY. THE

03:01:27.676 --> 03:01:28.811
SELF-STORAGE INDUSTRY

03:01:28.877 --> 03:01:29.745
RESPECTFULLY REQUESTS THAT THE

03:01:29.812 --> 03:01:31.614
12 MONTH MAXIMUM PRICE

03:01:31.680 --> 03:01:33.382
REQUIREMENT BE CHANGED TO SIX,

03:01:33.449 --> 03:01:35.651
AT WHICH POINT WE WOULD REMOVE

03:01:35.718 --> 03:01:37.052
OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. THANK

03:01:37.119 --> 03:01:39.855
YOU. IS ANYONE ELSE HERE IN

03:01:39.922 --> 03:01:44.193
OPPOSITION TO SB 709? CHAIR

03:01:50.666 --> 03:01:52.001
MR. CHAIRMAN ORACIO GONZALEZ, ON

BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA'S BUSINESS

03:01:53.602 --> 03:01:55.471
ROUNDTABLE. IN OPPOSITION. THANK

03:01:55.537 --> 03:01:57.940
YOU, DAVID. FIRST WORLD, FIRST

WORLD PROBLEMS. EXCESSIVE

03:01:59.908 --> 03:02:02.211
PROPERTY IS A LUXURY IN

03:02:02.278 --> 03:02:04.980
OPPOSITION. THANK YOU, MOIRA, ON

03:02:05.047 --> 03:02:07.249
BEHALF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY

03:02:07.316 --> 03:02:08.951
BUSINESS COUNCIL, IN OPPOSITION.

03:02:09.018 --> 03:02:12.021
THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. BRING IT

03:02:12.087 --> 03:02:14.123
BACK. WE DO HAVE A MOTION ON THE

03:02:14.189 --> 03:02:17.860
TABLE. VICE CHAIR, I HAVE A

03:02:17.926 --> 03:02:21.697
COMMENT. YEAH, PLEASE. HI. I

03:02:21.764 --> 03:02:23.599
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

03:02:23.666 --> 03:02:25.868
DO, SENATOR, AND I CERTAINLY

03:02:25.934 --> 03:02:28.270
HAVE EMPATHY FOR THOSE WHO ARE

03:02:28.337 --> 03:02:31.674
SHORT TERM STORAGE UNIT USERS.

03:02:31.740 --> 03:02:34.043
I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT I THINK

03:02:34.109 --> 03:02:36.679
YOUR SPEAKER USED REGULATING.

03:02:36.745 --> 03:02:39.281
THIS IS ONE AREA THAT'S NOT

03:02:39.348 --> 03:02:40.716
REGULATED. THAT'S KIND OF A

03:02:40.783 --> 03:02:42.651
ALARM BELL THAT GOES OFF IN MY

03:02:42.718 --> 03:02:43.552
MIND. ONE MORE REGULATION ON

03:02:43.619 --> 03:02:46.889
SOME CERTAIN TYPE OF INDUSTRY. I

03:02:46.955 --> 03:02:48.357
HOPE THAT THERE CAN BE A WORKOUT

03:02:48.424 --> 03:02:49.758
ON THE SIX MONTH. I'D BE

03:02:49.825 --> 03:02:50.392
SUPPORTIVE OF THAT, BUT

03:02:50.459 --> 03:02:52.194
OTHERWISE IT SPEAKS TO ME OF

03:02:52.261 --> 03:02:53.762
PRICE CONTROLS FOR STORAGE

03:02:53.829 --> 03:02:55.964
UNITS. I JUST THINK IT'S JUST

03:02:56.031 --> 03:02:59.168
NOT A GOOD DIRECTION TO FOR

03:02:59.234 --> 03:03:00.469
BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. SO I

03:03:00.536 --> 03:03:02.338
HOPE WE CAN WORK OUT. YOU CAN

03:03:02.404 --> 03:03:05.207
WORK OUT A SIX MONTH NOTICE, BUT

03:03:05.274 --> 03:03:07.009
A YEAR OUT THINGS CHANGE,

03:03:07.076 --> 03:03:08.610
INFLATION, ECONOMY. I THINK THAT

03:03:08.677 --> 03:03:10.979
PUTS A BURDEN ON THE BUSINESS.

03:03:11.046 --> 03:03:13.248
AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT INDUSTRY

03:03:13.315 --> 03:03:15.317
AND HELPS A LOT OF PEOPLE. I

03:03:15.384 --> 03:03:17.920
HAVE MY THINGS IN A STORAGE UNIT

03:03:17.986 --> 03:03:19.655
MYSELF AND I'VE EXPERIENCED

03:03:19.722 --> 03:03:22.958
PRICE INCREASES, BUT I I'M GLAD

03:03:23.025 --> 03:03:24.226
THAT THEY'RE THERE AND THEY'RE

03:03:24.293 --> 03:03:25.060
SAFE AND THEY'RE PROTECTED. SO

03:03:25.127 --> 03:03:27.229
THERE'S VALUE IN THAT

03:03:27.296 --> 03:03:29.431
ARRANGEMENT. SO I JUST I CAN'T

03:03:29.498 --> 03:03:31.166
BE SUPPORTING IT. BUT I HOPE YOU

03:03:31.233 --> 03:03:33.569
SEE A WAY TO AMEND IT TO LIMIT

03:03:33.635 --> 03:03:35.471
THAT EXPOSURE FOR THE COMPANY

03:03:35.537 --> 03:03:38.440
AND SATISFY THE SHORT TERM UNIT

03:03:38.507 --> 03:03:40.876
RENTERS. THANK YOU, SENATOR

03:03:40.943 --> 03:03:43.979
BURR. THANK YOU, SENATOR, FOR

03:03:44.046 --> 03:03:47.683
BRINGING THIS BILL. YOU KNOW, I,

03:03:47.750 --> 03:03:49.418
I ACTUALLY HAVE SOME QUESTIONS

03:03:49.485 --> 03:03:50.386
FOR THE OPPONENTS. I DON'T THINK

03:03:50.452 --> 03:03:52.187
THAT THIS SHOULD BE SOMETHING

03:03:52.254 --> 03:03:53.088
WHERE WE'RE BASICALLY REGULATING

03:03:53.155 --> 03:03:54.423
THESE PRICES. BUT ON THE OTHER

03:03:54.490 --> 03:03:56.892
HAND, THIS IS NOT ABOUT THAT.

03:03:56.959 --> 03:03:58.360
THIS IS ABOUT TRANSPARENCY. AND

03:03:58.427 --> 03:03:59.995
AT LEAST IT'S BEEN MY

03:04:00.062 --> 03:04:01.630
EXPERIENCE, AT LEAST IN CENTRAL

03:04:01.697 --> 03:04:03.265
PART OF LOS ANGELES, THAT PRICES

03:04:03.332 --> 03:04:06.468
HAVE GONE UP REALLY PRETTY

03:04:06.535 --> 03:04:09.304
EXTRAORDINARY. YOU KNOW,

03:04:09.371 --> 03:04:11.407
EXTRAORDINARILY I MEAN, I HAVE

03:04:11.473 --> 03:04:13.642
FOLKS IN THE PUBLIC STORAGE THAT

03:04:13.709 --> 03:04:15.778
ARE SORT OF BLOCKS FROM MY HOUSE

03:04:15.844 --> 03:04:17.546
WHO MY NEIGHBORS ARE COMPLAINING

03:04:17.613 --> 03:04:20.115
THAT TWO YEARS AGO THEY WERE

03:04:20.182 --> 03:04:21.283
PAYING ABOUT $300 A MONTH. THEN

03:04:21.350 --> 03:04:23.552
IT WENT UP TO 700 AND THE NEXT

03:04:23.619 --> 03:04:25.354
YEAR, AND NOW SOME OF THEM ARE

03:04:25.421 --> 03:04:26.555
PAYING $1,000 FOR SOMETHING THAT

03:04:26.622 --> 03:04:29.258
THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD BE

03:04:29.324 --> 03:04:30.392
PAYING 2 OR $300 A MONTH WHEN

03:04:30.459 --> 03:04:32.361
THEY RENTED THE UNIT. SO, I

03:04:32.428 --> 03:04:33.495
MEAN, THE SENATOR'S BILL DOESN'T

03:04:33.562 --> 03:04:36.598
EVEN GET TO THAT ISSUE. SO, YOU

03:04:36.665 --> 03:04:38.100
KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW, WHEN PEOPLE

03:04:38.167 --> 03:04:39.435
ARE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT THESE

03:04:39.501 --> 03:04:40.669
THINGS, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE GOING

03:04:40.736 --> 03:04:41.637
THROUGH THE EFFORT OF RENTING

03:04:41.703 --> 03:04:43.806
THE TRUCK, OF GOING THERE. THEY

03:04:43.872 --> 03:04:45.741
HAVE A BUNCH OF EXPENSES, AND IT

03:04:45.808 --> 03:04:47.209
IS A DIFFERENT THING. IF THEY'RE

03:04:47.276 --> 03:04:49.278
GOING TO SIT BACK AND, YOU KNOW,

03:04:49.344 --> 03:04:50.813
THEY NEED SOME PLACE TO STORE

03:04:50.879 --> 03:04:53.182
SOMETHING FOR, YOU KNOW, FOR A

03:04:53.248 --> 03:04:55.551
YEAR OR TWO YEARS BECAUSE THEIR

03:04:55.617 --> 03:04:56.785
HOUSE IS BEING WORKED ON OR

03:04:56.852 --> 03:04:59.321
THEY'RE BETWEEN PLACES. THEY

03:04:59.388 --> 03:05:00.556
SHOULD THEY SHOULD SORT OF KNOW

03:05:00.622 --> 03:05:02.658
WHAT THE COSTS ARE GOING TO BE,

03:05:02.724 --> 03:05:03.892
RATHER THAN PRICING SCHEMES THAT

03:05:03.959 --> 03:05:05.461
ALLOW YOU TO SORT OF HAVE A, A

03:05:05.527 --> 03:05:07.262
LOW AMOUNT, A LOW PRICE. AND

03:05:07.329 --> 03:05:09.398
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN SIX MONTHS

03:05:09.465 --> 03:05:10.532
LATER IT DOUBLES AND YOU'VE GOT

03:05:10.599 --> 03:05:12.634
TO BEAR THE EXPENSES OF RENTING

03:05:12.701 --> 03:05:14.069
A TRUCK AND GETTING AND, YOU

03:05:14.136 --> 03:05:15.304
KNOW, AND THE TIME TO MOVE ALL

03:05:15.370 --> 03:05:18.340
OF THAT. SO I GUESS THE QUESTION

03:05:18.407 --> 03:05:21.276
IS, I HEARD THAT THERE WAS A

03:05:21.343 --> 03:05:22.277
STATEMENT THAT THE PRICES

03:05:22.344 --> 03:05:23.745
HAVEN'T GONE UP OVER TIME. IS

03:05:23.812 --> 03:05:25.380
THAT DO YOU HAVE DATA FROM THE

03:05:25.447 --> 03:05:26.482
LOS ANGELES AREA? BECAUSE THAT'S

03:05:26.548 --> 03:05:29.117
NOT MY THE WHAT I'M HEARING FROM

03:05:29.184 --> 03:05:31.320
CONSTITUENTS. WE CAN I DON'T

03:05:31.386 --> 03:05:32.354
HAVE THE DATA WITH ME, BUT WE

03:05:32.421 --> 03:05:33.956
CERTAINLY WE CERTAINLY CAN

03:05:34.022 --> 03:05:37.493
PROVIDE THAT DATA. YOU KNOW, THE

03:05:37.559 --> 03:05:39.728
DATA IS SIMILAR IN LOS ANGELES

03:05:39.795 --> 03:05:41.430
AS IT IS NATIONALLY. I CAN

03:05:41.497 --> 03:05:42.865
PROVIDE GREEN STREET DATA. AND

03:05:42.931 --> 03:05:45.734
WE ALSO IN THE CALIFORNIA SELF

03:05:45.801 --> 03:05:47.503
STORAGE ASSOCIATION, WE

03:05:47.569 --> 03:05:49.738
COLLECTED DATA FROM A DIFFERENT

03:05:49.805 --> 03:05:51.473
REGIONS IN CALIFORNIA AND

03:05:51.540 --> 03:05:54.409
CALIFORNIA. OVERALL TO

03:05:54.476 --> 03:05:56.712
DEMONSTRATE THAT THAT IS THE

03:05:56.778 --> 03:05:58.113
CASE. SO WE CAN SHARE THAT.

03:05:58.180 --> 03:06:00.916
THANK YOU. WELL, THANK THANK

03:06:00.983 --> 03:06:02.351
YOU. I MEAN I'LL BE SUPPORTING

03:06:02.417 --> 03:06:04.820
THE BILL TODAY. I WOULD ACTUALLY

03:06:04.887 --> 03:06:06.154
ENCOURAGE YOU TO KEEP THE 12

03:06:06.221 --> 03:06:07.823
MONTH PERIOD ON. I MEAN, I THINK

03:06:07.890 --> 03:06:10.158
IT'S I THINK IT'S NECESSARY. I

03:06:10.225 --> 03:06:11.894
MEAN, SOMEONE WANTS TO RENT A

03:06:11.960 --> 03:06:14.229
UNIT. MOST PEOPLE THAT ARE

03:06:14.296 --> 03:06:15.497
RENTING UNITS ARE NOT DOING IT

03:06:15.564 --> 03:06:17.399
FOR SHORT AMOUNTS OF TIME. I

03:06:17.466 --> 03:06:18.166
THINK THERE'S, THERE'S A,

03:06:18.233 --> 03:06:19.501
THERE'S A SUB MARKET OF THAT,

03:06:19.568 --> 03:06:21.069
BUT THERE'S FOLKS THAT ARE

03:06:21.136 --> 03:06:22.638
RENTING FOR LONGER PERIODS OF

03:06:22.704 --> 03:06:23.405
TIME. AND IF THEY'RE MAKING

03:06:23.472 --> 03:06:24.540
DECISIONS ABOUT WHERE THEY'RE

03:06:24.606 --> 03:06:25.974
GOING TO GO, THEY SHOULD AT

03:06:26.041 --> 03:06:27.509
LEAST BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND SORT

03:06:27.576 --> 03:06:29.444
OF WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST FOR A

03:06:29.511 --> 03:06:31.313
YEAR. AND IF THE, YOU KNOW, IF

03:06:31.380 --> 03:06:32.247
THE INTENT, IF THERE ARE PRICING

03:06:32.314 --> 03:06:34.283
SCHEMES THAT ARE COMMON, WHERE

03:06:34.349 --> 03:06:35.617
YOU'RE BASICALLY LO, YOU KNOW,

03:06:35.684 --> 03:06:36.518
YOU'VE GOT COST LEADERS THAT ARE

03:06:36.585 --> 03:06:38.387
COMING IN FOR A FEW MONTHS AND

03:06:38.453 --> 03:06:40.489
THEN IT'S GOING TO PUMP UP FOR A

03:06:40.556 --> 03:06:42.991
LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. YOU KNOW,

03:06:43.058 --> 03:06:44.560
FOLKS SHOULD KNOW THAT, I THINK.

03:06:44.626 --> 03:06:46.929
SO WITH THAT, I THANK YOU FOR

03:06:46.995 --> 03:06:48.830
BRINGING THE BILL AND PLAN TO

03:06:48.897 --> 03:06:52.367
SUPPORT IT TODAY. YEAH, I ALSO

03:06:52.434 --> 03:06:54.803
WANT TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER PACHECO.

03:06:54.870 --> 03:06:57.573
SO I HAD A QUESTION. I KNOW THE

03:06:57.639 --> 03:06:59.508
OPPOSITION. THE ARGUMENT IS THAT

03:06:59.575 --> 03:07:02.044
THE REASON WHY SIX MONTHS IS

03:07:02.110 --> 03:07:05.347
NECESSARY IS BECAUSE THAT'S THE

03:07:05.414 --> 03:07:07.015
AMOUNT OF TIME THAT NORMALLY

03:07:07.082 --> 03:07:09.585
PEOPLE RENT STORAGE UNITS, BUT

03:07:09.651 --> 03:07:11.019
THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT RENT IT

03:07:11.086 --> 03:07:13.221
FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME. WHAT

03:07:13.288 --> 03:07:14.790
IS THE ISSUE BETWEEN SIX MONTHS

03:07:14.856 --> 03:07:17.693
AND A YEAR? BESIDES THE ARGUMENT

03:07:17.759 --> 03:07:19.995
THAT MOST PEOPLE RENT IT FOR SIX

03:07:20.062 --> 03:07:21.597
MONTHS, IS THERE ANOTHER

03:07:21.663 --> 03:07:23.398
RATIONALE FOR SIX MONTHS VERSUS

03:07:23.465 --> 03:07:24.766
A YEAR? WELL, IT MOSTLY HAS TO

03:07:24.833 --> 03:07:27.502
DO WITH THE ACTUAL EXPERIENCE

03:07:27.569 --> 03:07:29.071
AND THE DATA SET. SO SELF

03:07:29.137 --> 03:07:33.475
STORAGE RATES CHANGE DAILY BASED

03:07:33.542 --> 03:07:35.510
UPON MARKET FACTORS SUPPLY AND

03:07:35.577 --> 03:07:37.346
DEMAND. SO NOT MUCH DIFFERENT

03:07:37.412 --> 03:07:41.249
THAN AIRLINE PRICING HOTEL

03:07:41.316 --> 03:07:44.252
PRICING IN ANY GIVEN MARKET

03:07:44.319 --> 03:07:46.088
THERE THERE ARE FIVE BY FIVES,

03:07:46.154 --> 03:07:48.223
FIVE BY TENS, TEN BY TENS, SEVEN

03:07:48.290 --> 03:07:49.591
BY TENS. THERE'S A WHOLE HOST OF

03:07:49.658 --> 03:07:51.627
DIFFERENT SIZE GROUPINGS THAT

03:07:51.693 --> 03:07:53.862
COMPETE IN A 3 TO 5 MILE

03:07:53.929 --> 03:07:56.298
MARKETPLACE WITH THOSE SAME SIZE

03:07:56.365 --> 03:07:59.935
GROUPINGS AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER

03:08:00.002 --> 03:08:02.804
DIFFERENT ECONOMIC FACTORS

03:08:02.871 --> 03:08:06.842
AFFECT WHAT THE PRICE SHOULD BE

03:08:06.908 --> 03:08:08.910
IN ANY ONE OF THOSE GIVEN SIZE

03:08:08.977 --> 03:08:10.779
GROUPINGS ON A DAY TO DAY, MONTH

03:08:10.846 --> 03:08:13.281
TO MONTH BASIS. SO IT'S A FAIRLY

03:08:13.348 --> 03:08:15.083
COMPLEX EXERCISE IN THE DATA SET

03:08:15.150 --> 03:08:17.653
IS NECESSARILY LIMITED TO THE

03:08:17.719 --> 03:08:19.388
ACTUAL EXPERIENCE WHERE THE

03:08:19.454 --> 03:08:20.922
MAJORITY OF CUSTOMERS ARE THERE

03:08:20.989 --> 03:08:23.992
SIX MONTHS OR LESS. SO THE

03:08:24.059 --> 03:08:25.794
ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND WHERE

03:08:25.861 --> 03:08:27.929
PRICING IS GOING TO BE A YEAR

03:08:27.996 --> 03:08:30.298
OUT IS A MUCH RISKIER PROSPECT

03:08:30.365 --> 03:08:32.134
THAN SIX MONTHS, WHICH IS WHERE

03:08:32.200 --> 03:08:35.570
THE DATA LIVES. AND WE CAN

03:08:35.637 --> 03:08:37.305
CERTAINLY SET THOSE PRICES. THE

03:08:37.372 --> 03:08:39.341
ARGUMENT IS NOT THAT YOU CAN'T

03:08:39.408 --> 03:08:41.376
HAVE A 12 MONTH CAP, IS THAT IF

03:08:41.443 --> 03:08:43.211
YOU DO HAVE IMPOSE A 12 MONTH

03:08:43.278 --> 03:08:44.946
CAP, THAT YOU'RE ASKING

03:08:45.013 --> 03:08:46.381
OPERATORS TO TAKE THAT

03:08:46.448 --> 03:08:48.150
ADDITIONAL RISK, AND WE SEE HOW

03:08:48.216 --> 03:08:50.719
THE MARKET FLUCTUATIONS IMPACT

03:08:50.786 --> 03:08:52.487
PRICES EVERY DAY. IF YOU'RE

03:08:52.554 --> 03:08:54.222
ASKING ME TO MAKE THAT GUESS A

03:08:54.289 --> 03:08:56.558
YEAR OUT, I NEED TO GUESS HIGH

03:08:56.625 --> 03:08:58.226
BECAUSE I CAN'T BE I CAN'T BE

03:08:58.293 --> 03:09:00.729
CAUGHT SHORT. AND AS A RESULT, I

03:09:00.796 --> 03:09:03.832
NEED TO CHARGE YOU MORE MONEY UP

03:09:03.899 --> 03:09:07.069
FRONT IN ORDER TO PROTECT OFFSET

03:09:07.135 --> 03:09:09.304
THAT RISK. AND I NEED TO PRICE

03:09:09.371 --> 03:09:10.706
THAT CAP HIGH, WHICH DOESN'T

03:09:10.772 --> 03:09:13.041
REALLY DO ANYBODY TERRIBLY MUCH

03:09:13.108 --> 03:09:16.211
GOOD. SO WE'RE WE ARE CONCERNED

03:09:16.278 --> 03:09:18.113
THAT IT'S GOING TO NEGATIVELY

03:09:18.180 --> 03:09:20.615
IMPACT OUR CONSUMER EXPERIENCE

03:09:20.682 --> 03:09:24.252
BECAUSE YOU'LL HAVE A HIGH CAP

03:09:24.319 --> 03:09:25.987
AND A HIGHER INTRODUCTORY RATE,

03:09:26.054 --> 03:09:27.389
BECAUSE OPERATORS WON'T BE ABLE

03:09:27.456 --> 03:09:29.958
TO TAKE THE RISK OF OFFERING AN

03:09:30.025 --> 03:09:31.326
AGGRESSIVELY LOW PROMOTIONAL

03:09:31.393 --> 03:09:33.595
RATE, WHICH MOST PEOPLE ENJOY

03:09:33.662 --> 03:09:34.563
BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE ARE SHORTER

03:09:34.629 --> 03:09:37.933
TERM RENTERS. AND THEN YOU CAN

03:09:37.999 --> 03:09:40.102
PREDICT FOR A SIX MONTH, WE CAN

03:09:40.168 --> 03:09:41.970
PREDICT BETTER. WE'D PREFER NOT

03:09:42.037 --> 03:09:44.039
TO HAVE TO PREDICT SIX MONTHS,

03:09:44.106 --> 03:09:45.774
BUT THIS IS A DISCUSSION AND

03:09:45.841 --> 03:09:47.909
THERE'S BACK AND FORTH. WE WE'RE

03:09:47.976 --> 03:09:49.778
MUCH BETTER AT PREDICTING SIX

03:09:49.845 --> 03:09:51.847
MONTHS BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF

03:09:51.913 --> 03:09:54.015
OUR CUSTOMERS HISTORICALLY STAY

03:09:54.082 --> 03:09:57.018
SIX MONTHS OR LESS. GOING OUT 12

03:09:57.085 --> 03:09:59.521
MONTHS IS A MUCH RISKIER,

03:09:59.588 --> 03:10:00.856
RISKIER PROSPECT. AND WHEN YOU

03:10:00.922 --> 03:10:02.290
SAY MAJORITY LIKE IS THERE A

03:10:02.357 --> 03:10:03.492
CERTAIN PERCENTAGE, WOULD YOU

03:10:03.558 --> 03:10:06.661
SAY 50, 60, 70%? YEAH, IT

03:10:06.728 --> 03:10:09.965
ACTUALLY IS IT EXACTLY IN THAT

03:10:10.031 --> 03:10:11.500
AREA? IT DIFFERS SLIGHTLY. WHEN

03:10:11.566 --> 03:10:13.769
WE DID OUR SURVEYS THAT I WAS

03:10:13.835 --> 03:10:14.636
REFERRING TO EARLIER IN

03:10:14.703 --> 03:10:15.971
CALIFORNIA, IT DIFFERS SLIGHTLY

03:10:16.037 --> 03:10:19.674
AMONG OPERATORS, BUT THE AVERAGE

03:10:19.741 --> 03:10:26.148
IS 60 TO 65% OF CUSTOMERS LEAVE

03:10:26.214 --> 03:10:28.316
BEFORE THEY HIT THEIR SIX MONTH

03:10:28.383 --> 03:10:30.018
ANNIVERSARY. AND WOULD YOU SAY

03:10:30.085 --> 03:10:31.219
THAT IT'S DIFFERENT WITHIN

03:10:31.286 --> 03:10:32.921
DIFFERENT PARTS OF CALIFORNIA?

03:10:32.988 --> 03:10:35.123
LIKE, DO YOU SEE A HIGHER

03:10:35.190 --> 03:10:36.625
PROPENSITY OF USERS OF. BECAUSE

03:10:36.691 --> 03:10:40.529
MY MOM USES ONE AND SHE'S BEEN

03:10:40.595 --> 03:10:41.496
THERE FOR SEVERAL YEARS. STORAGE

03:10:41.563 --> 03:10:43.932
FACILITY. GENERALLY, THE URBAN

03:10:43.999 --> 03:10:48.036
CENTERS HAVE SHORTER TERM STAYS,

03:10:48.103 --> 03:10:50.839
AND THE SUBURBAN AND MORE RURAL

03:10:50.906 --> 03:10:52.707
CENTERS HAVE LONGER TERM STAYS,

03:10:52.774 --> 03:10:54.910
BIGGER UNITS, LONGER TERM STAYS.

03:10:54.976 --> 03:10:57.045
AND AS YOU GET MORE DENSELY

03:10:57.112 --> 03:10:58.079
POPULATED, SMALLER UNITS,

03:10:58.146 --> 03:11:00.282
SHORTER TERM STAYS. AND I'M JUST

03:11:00.348 --> 03:11:01.716
CURIOUS, I JUST WANT TO HEAR

03:11:01.783 --> 03:11:04.252
FROM THE AUTHOR BECAUSE I THINK

03:11:04.319 --> 03:11:06.655
THIS IS IMPORTANT. BUT I'M

03:11:06.721 --> 03:11:08.490
CURIOUS TO HEAR, IS THERE A

03:11:08.557 --> 03:11:11.026
REASON WHY SIX MONTHS VERSUS OR

03:11:11.092 --> 03:11:12.828
A YEAR VERSUS SIX MONTHS?

03:11:12.894 --> 03:11:14.196
ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU. AND YOU

03:11:14.262 --> 03:11:16.631
KNOW, I HAVE DATA TO PROVE. I'M

03:11:16.698 --> 03:11:18.466
NOT JUST TALKING TO TALK. I HAVE

03:11:18.533 --> 03:11:20.368
DATA THAT I CAN POINT TO AND

03:11:20.435 --> 03:11:22.237
SHOW THESE NUMBERS. IN FACT,

03:11:22.304 --> 03:11:23.505
JUST LAST YEAR AND I'M GETTING

03:11:23.572 --> 03:11:25.407
THE YEAR CORRECT. BUT THE

03:11:25.473 --> 03:11:28.343
LEADERS IN THIS INDUSTRY HELD A

03:11:28.410 --> 03:11:31.012
CONFERENCE, HELD A CONFERENCE IN

03:11:31.079 --> 03:11:33.081
LAS VEGAS TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

03:11:33.148 --> 03:11:35.250
AND ONE OF THE PANELISTS SAID,

03:11:35.317 --> 03:11:36.551
WE DON'T IT DOESN'T MATTER IF WE

03:11:36.618 --> 03:11:40.355
DO THE $1 PROMOTIONAL, AS LONG

03:11:40.422 --> 03:11:42.791
AS THEY STAY NINE MONTHS, WE

03:11:42.858 --> 03:11:44.259
MAKE UP FOR IT. SO THEY'RE

03:11:44.326 --> 03:11:45.560
ALREADY ASSUMING THE MAJORITY OF

03:11:45.627 --> 03:11:47.762
THE RENTERS ARE GOING TO BE

03:11:47.829 --> 03:11:48.563
THERE FOR NINE MONTHS. THAT'S

03:11:48.630 --> 03:11:50.332
HOW THEY MAKE THEIR MONEY'S

03:11:50.398 --> 03:11:53.368
WORTH FOR DOING THE $1. THIS IS

03:11:53.435 --> 03:11:53.969
STRAIGHT FROM THE LEADERS IN

03:11:54.035 --> 03:11:55.570
THIS CONFERENCE THAT LA TIMES

03:11:55.637 --> 03:11:57.539
AND THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE

03:11:57.606 --> 03:11:59.341
DID AN ARTICLE ON THIS. THEY

03:11:59.407 --> 03:12:00.542
TALK ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THEY

03:12:00.609 --> 03:12:02.644
KNOW THEY'LL STAY HERE LONG.

03:12:02.711 --> 03:12:05.046
IT'S ALSO AND WE DON'T I KNOW

03:12:05.113 --> 03:12:06.481
SENATOR DIXON TALKED ABOUT

03:12:06.548 --> 03:12:07.716
REGULATION. THAT'S A TRIGGER FOR

03:12:07.782 --> 03:12:09.517
HER. BUT WITHOUT REGULATION AND

03:12:09.584 --> 03:12:11.453
WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF DATA. SO

03:12:11.519 --> 03:12:13.121
I HAVE ANOTHER REPORT FROM 2015,

03:12:13.188 --> 03:12:15.156
WHICH IS FROM THE ACTUAL

03:12:15.223 --> 03:12:16.558
SELF-STORAGE ASSOCIATION

03:12:16.625 --> 03:12:19.494
THEMSELVES. AND THEIR REPORT HAS

03:12:19.561 --> 03:12:21.496
70% OF THEIR RENTERS SEVEN

03:12:21.563 --> 03:12:26.334
MONTHS AND ABOVE 18% FOR 7 TO 12

03:12:26.401 --> 03:12:28.970
MONTHS, 22% FOR 1 TO 2 YEARS AND

03:12:29.037 --> 03:12:30.805
30% FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS.

03:12:30.872 --> 03:12:32.440
THAT'S THE MAJORITY OF RENTERS

03:12:32.507 --> 03:12:35.310
ABOVE SIX MONTHS. I MEAN, I HAVE

03:12:35.377 --> 03:12:35.944
DATA, RESPECTFULLY, YOU ASK THE

03:12:36.011 --> 03:12:38.446
QUESTION TO THE OPPOSITION. THE

03:12:38.513 --> 03:12:40.081
RESPONSE WAS, OH, IT'S IN THE

03:12:40.148 --> 03:12:42.617
BALLPARK WITHOUT POINTED TO

03:12:42.684 --> 03:12:44.452
ACTUAL REPORTS HERE. SO THAT'S

03:12:44.519 --> 03:12:46.488
WHERE WE GOT THIS NUMBER OF 12,

03:12:46.554 --> 03:12:47.489
BECAUSE THAT'S THE THAT'S WHAT

03:12:47.555 --> 03:12:50.158
WE'RE SEEING OF THESE NUMBERS

03:12:50.225 --> 03:12:51.960
INITIALLY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LET'S

03:12:52.027 --> 03:12:53.528
THINK ABOUT THE DISASTERS THAT

03:12:53.595 --> 03:12:56.231
KEEP HAPPENING. MORE PEOPLE ARE

03:12:56.298 --> 03:12:57.999
UTILIZING SELF-STORAGE NOT FOR

03:12:58.066 --> 03:13:01.069
EXCESS FOR OF LUXURY. AS SOMEONE

03:13:01.136 --> 03:13:02.637
POINTED OUT IN THE OPPOSITION

03:13:02.704 --> 03:13:03.738
BEHIND. BUT IT'S FOR A

03:13:03.805 --> 03:13:05.073
NECESSITY. SO LET'S THINK OF THE

03:13:05.140 --> 03:13:06.274
PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE HOMES

03:13:06.341 --> 03:13:08.076
BECAUSE OF THE FIRES, THE

03:13:08.143 --> 03:13:09.377
FLOODS, WHO ARE NOW GOING TO BE

03:13:09.444 --> 03:13:10.345
TURNING TO THESE ENTITIES. SO

03:13:10.412 --> 03:13:12.681
I'M COMING TO YOU, COLLEAGUES,

03:13:12.747 --> 03:13:13.782
WITH DATA SUPPORTING OUR

03:13:13.848 --> 03:13:17.018
POSITION HERE, NOT JUST SPEAKING

03:13:17.085 --> 03:13:19.621
TO JUST SPEAK. AND I'M CURIOUS,

03:13:19.688 --> 03:13:21.890
YOU ACTUALLY DID PROVIDE

03:13:21.957 --> 03:13:23.658
SPECIFIC INFORMATION, SPECIFIC

03:13:23.725 --> 03:13:26.261
DATA AS TO THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE

03:13:26.328 --> 03:13:27.662
UTILIZING THESE STORAGE

03:13:27.729 --> 03:13:28.997
FACILITIES. I'M CURIOUS WHAT

03:13:29.064 --> 03:13:30.932
YOUR INPUT IS AS TO THE NUMBERS

03:13:30.999 --> 03:13:32.534
THAT THE AUTHOR JUST MENTIONED.

03:13:32.600 --> 03:13:34.002
YEAH, IT'S WHAT MY COLLEAGUE

03:13:34.069 --> 03:13:36.237
REFERENCED. THE DIFFERENCES

03:13:36.304 --> 03:13:37.973
BETWEEN MEDIAN AND MEAN. SO WHEN

03:13:38.039 --> 03:13:42.644
WE TALK ABOUT THE AVERAGE, THERE

03:13:42.711 --> 03:13:44.512
ARE SOME CUSTOMERS WHO STAY VERY

03:13:44.579 --> 03:13:46.614
LONG TIME THAT SKEWS THE DATA.

03:13:46.681 --> 03:13:49.784
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE MEDIAN OF

03:13:49.851 --> 03:13:51.586
WHERE CUSTOMERS ARE, THE

03:13:51.653 --> 03:13:53.421
MAJORITY OF THE NUMBER OF

03:13:53.488 --> 03:13:55.223
CUSTOMERS WHO RENT SELF-STORAGE,

03:13:55.290 --> 03:13:57.425
SAY SIX MONTHS OR LESS, THE

03:13:57.492 --> 03:13:59.894
AVERAGE LENGTH OF STAY OF ALL

03:13:59.961 --> 03:14:01.863
CUSTOMERS IS QUITE A BIT LONGER,

03:14:01.930 --> 03:14:04.599
BUT THE AMOUNT OF CUSTOMERS THAT

03:14:04.666 --> 03:14:08.169
STAY IS LESS THAN SIX MONTHS ON

03:14:08.236 --> 03:14:10.405
AVERAGE. IT'S THE MEDIAN VERSUS

03:14:10.472 --> 03:14:15.744
MEAN AND INTERESTING. SO I'M

03:14:15.810 --> 03:14:17.278
ACTUALLY I'M GOING TO BE

03:14:17.345 --> 03:14:19.180
SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY. I

03:14:19.247 --> 03:14:20.548
WOULD STILL LIKE TO SEE

03:14:20.615 --> 03:14:22.283
CONVERSATIONS HAPPENING. MY VOTE

03:14:22.350 --> 03:14:23.685
MAY CHANGE WHEN IT GETS ON THE

03:14:23.752 --> 03:14:27.589
FLOOR. AND IF THERE'S ANY

03:14:27.655 --> 03:14:29.424
ADDITIONAL DATA THAT CAN BE

03:14:29.491 --> 03:14:31.259
PROVIDED TO ME, I WOULD LOVE TO

03:14:31.326 --> 03:14:34.195
SEE THAT DATA, BECAUSE I THINK

03:14:34.262 --> 03:14:36.998
THE SENATOR HERE DID PROVIDE

03:14:37.065 --> 03:14:38.166
INFORMATION. SHE STATED ON THE

03:14:38.233 --> 03:14:39.968
RECORD WHAT HER INFORMATION IS.

03:14:40.035 --> 03:14:41.836
SO IF THERE'S ANY INFORMATION

03:14:41.903 --> 03:14:43.905
THAT THE OPPOSITION WOULD LIKE

03:14:43.972 --> 03:14:45.140
TO PROVIDE ME AND TO MY OFFICE,

03:14:45.206 --> 03:14:47.509
I WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE IT.

03:14:47.575 --> 03:14:49.044
BUT I AM SUPPORTING THE BILL

03:14:49.110 --> 03:14:52.113
TODAY. SENATOR PEPPIN, REAL

03:14:52.180 --> 03:14:53.515
QUICK, WHAT IS YOUR

03:14:53.581 --> 03:14:54.682
UNDERSTANDING AS TO WHY THERE

03:14:54.749 --> 03:14:57.652
ARE FLUCTUATIONS IN FLUCTUATIONS

03:14:57.719 --> 03:15:00.455
OF PRICES? WHY RAISES? YEAH, WHY

03:15:00.522 --> 03:15:02.657
GOES UP? WHY IT MIGHT GO DOWN

03:15:02.724 --> 03:15:04.659
WITHIN THAT YEAR. I MEAN, I

03:15:04.726 --> 03:15:07.162
DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN RENT

03:15:07.228 --> 03:15:09.731
DECREASE. WHATEVER IT IS, WHAT

03:15:09.798 --> 03:15:11.232
GOES IN, WHAT IS FACTORED INTO

03:15:11.299 --> 03:15:13.368
THAT TO MAKE IT GO UP. IT'S JUST

03:15:13.435 --> 03:15:15.336
GOING UP FOR THE HECK OF IT. OR

03:15:15.403 --> 03:15:17.138
ARE THERE REASONS BEHIND IT? I

03:15:17.205 --> 03:15:18.073
THINK THAT QUESTION MIGHT BE

03:15:18.139 --> 03:15:19.607
BETTER POSED FOR. WELL, I JUST

03:15:19.674 --> 03:15:21.209
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOUR

03:15:21.276 --> 03:15:22.310
UNDERSTANDING IS OF IT. I THINK

03:15:22.377 --> 03:15:24.512
THAT'S JUST PART OF BUSINESS OR

03:15:24.579 --> 03:15:25.680
ANY KIND OF BUSINESS, RIGHT? WE

03:15:25.747 --> 03:15:26.948
RAISE MONEY. IT'S THE HUGE

03:15:27.015 --> 03:15:28.416
DEMAND. THIS IS ONE OF THE

03:15:28.483 --> 03:15:29.484
GROWING ONE OF THE NUMBER ONE

03:15:29.551 --> 03:15:31.519
GROWING COMMERCIAL MARKETS THAT

03:15:31.586 --> 03:15:33.088
EVEN A GLOBAL COMMERCIAL REAL

03:15:33.154 --> 03:15:35.323
ESTATE COMPANY, CUSHMAN AND

03:15:35.390 --> 03:15:37.158
WAKEFIELD HAS POINTED TO AS A

03:15:37.225 --> 03:15:38.827
REALLY BOOMING INDUSTRY. SO IF

03:15:38.893 --> 03:15:41.062
THE DEMAND IS THERE, I THINK

03:15:41.129 --> 03:15:43.198
THAT'S JUST A SUPPLY DEMAND KIND

03:15:43.264 --> 03:15:44.299
OF APPROACH. BUT I WOULD

03:15:44.365 --> 03:15:45.733
RESPECTFULLY, I THINK, AND I'LL

03:15:45.800 --> 03:15:47.535
GET TO THEM. I JUST WANTED TO

03:15:47.602 --> 03:15:49.104
KNOW WHAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING,

03:15:49.170 --> 03:15:50.205
BECAUSE THEIR CONTENTION IS THIS

03:15:50.271 --> 03:15:51.806
IS VERY SPECULATIVE FOR THEM.

03:15:51.873 --> 03:15:53.875
AND SO I WONDERED, IRRESPECTIVE

03:15:53.942 --> 03:15:56.177
OF LENGTH OF TIME, WHAT ARE THE

03:15:56.244 --> 03:15:57.979
FACTORS THAT ARE GOING INTO THIS

03:15:58.046 --> 03:16:00.849
SORT OF SPECULATIVE FEATURE OF

03:16:00.915 --> 03:16:04.519
HOW MUCH? AND SO I WILL ASK

03:16:04.586 --> 03:16:07.722
THEM, BUT THE ONLY THING I CAN

03:16:07.789 --> 03:16:08.423
POINT TO IS THAT IN THE ONGOING

03:16:08.490 --> 03:16:09.724
CONVERSATION THAT ALSO HAPPENED

03:16:09.791 --> 03:16:10.925
AT THIS LAS VEGAS CONFERENCE IN

03:16:10.992 --> 03:16:13.261
THIS INDUSTRY, IS THE FACT THAT

03:16:13.328 --> 03:16:15.630
IT'S REALLY HARD FOR CUSTOMERS

03:16:15.697 --> 03:16:17.132
TO LEAVE ONCE THEY GET HOOKED

03:16:17.198 --> 03:16:19.634
IN. I KNOW IT'S A FLEXIBLE MONTH

03:16:19.701 --> 03:16:21.369
TO MONTH, AND ON PAPER IT IS

03:16:21.436 --> 03:16:23.404
VERY EASY. YOU CAN JUST YOU GIVE

03:16:23.471 --> 03:16:25.340
A 30 DAYS NOTICE AND YOU HAVE TO

03:16:25.406 --> 03:16:27.108
LEAVE. BUT I MEAN, I HAD TO PAY

03:16:27.175 --> 03:16:28.943
FOR $100 FOR A MOVING COMPANY

03:16:29.010 --> 03:16:30.078
JUST TO MOVE MY STUFF INTO

03:16:30.145 --> 03:16:31.579
STORAGE. YOU DON'T MAKE THAT

03:16:31.646 --> 03:16:33.681
THAT DECISION LIGHTLY. IF

03:16:33.748 --> 03:16:34.315
SOMEONE IF THEY TELL YOU, HEY,

03:16:34.382 --> 03:16:36.618
YOUR RENT IS BEING HIKED 30%,

03:16:36.684 --> 03:16:38.953
YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE ALL THE

03:16:39.020 --> 03:16:41.856
OTHER COSTS INTO INTO

03:16:41.923 --> 03:16:43.358
CALCULATION IF YOU WANT TO MOVE.

03:16:43.424 --> 03:16:45.894
SO ONCE THE CONSUMER IS HOOKED,

03:16:45.960 --> 03:16:46.895
THEY'RE ABLE TO INCREASE. AND

03:16:46.961 --> 03:16:48.196
THERE'S A PHRASE FOR THAT. IN

03:16:48.263 --> 03:16:50.165
FACT IT'S CALLED THE EXISTING

03:16:50.231 --> 03:16:52.333
CUSTOMER RATE INCREASE. IT'S A

03:16:52.400 --> 03:16:54.169
PHENOMENON BETTER KNOWN AS IT'S

03:16:54.235 --> 03:16:55.603
EASY FOR THEM TO INCREASE PRICES

03:16:55.670 --> 03:16:57.739
ONCE A CONSUMER IS IN THERE AND

03:16:57.805 --> 03:16:59.340
HOOKED FOR THE YOU'RE PAYING FOR

03:16:59.407 --> 03:17:01.576
THE INCONVENIENCE OF HAVING TO

03:17:01.643 --> 03:17:03.178
UNDERSTAND. SO YOU DESCRIBED IT

03:17:03.244 --> 03:17:04.579
RELATIVELY OPAQUE PROCESS, MR.

03:17:04.646 --> 03:17:06.314
SUGARMAN. SO I'D LIKE TO HEAR

03:17:06.381 --> 03:17:07.982
FROM YOU AS TO WHAT ARE THE

03:17:08.049 --> 03:17:08.650
FLUCTUATING RATES. MY EXPERIENCE

03:17:08.716 --> 03:17:11.419
HAS BEEN, AS I DON'T KNOW ABOUT

03:17:11.486 --> 03:17:12.620
SIZE, BUT CERTAINLY THE FARTHER

03:17:12.687 --> 03:17:14.088
OUT OF AN URBAN AREA YOU ARE,

03:17:14.155 --> 03:17:17.192
THE CHEAPER IT IS TO LAND IS

03:17:17.258 --> 03:17:18.426
CHEAPER. THERE ARE A LOT OF

03:17:18.493 --> 03:17:20.662
THINGS THAT GO INTO IT, BUT THAT

03:17:20.728 --> 03:17:21.529
DOESN'T CHANGE NECESSARILY ON ON

03:17:21.596 --> 03:17:23.431
A SIX MONTH, NINE MONTH, ONE

03:17:23.498 --> 03:17:26.201
YEAR BASIS, YOU, YOU KNOW HOW

03:17:26.267 --> 03:17:28.336
WHAT THE SIZES ARE AND THE LAND

03:17:28.403 --> 03:17:30.805
ISN'T. I THINK YOU GAVE A YOU

03:17:30.872 --> 03:17:32.240
COMPARED TO HOW MUCH RENTS WENT

03:17:32.307 --> 03:17:35.577
UP AND THEN HOW MUCH STORAGE

03:17:35.643 --> 03:17:37.412
FEES WENT UP. AND I ACUTELY

03:17:37.478 --> 03:17:39.480
LISTENED TO THAT. SO IF YOU

03:17:39.547 --> 03:17:41.416
COULD DESCRIBE FOR US WHAT IS

03:17:41.482 --> 03:17:42.784
BEING TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT INTO

03:17:42.850 --> 03:17:46.754
THIS DAILY FLUCTUATION OF RENTS,

03:17:46.821 --> 03:17:49.257
IT'S ALL SUPPLY DEMAND. SO IN A

03:17:49.324 --> 03:17:51.693
GIVEN MARKET, SAY THERE ARE X

03:17:51.759 --> 03:17:55.063
NUMBER OF TEN BY TENS AND

03:17:55.129 --> 03:17:56.864
THERE'S A CALLING FOR TEN BY

03:17:56.931 --> 03:17:58.700
TENS. SO IT'S ALL A MATTER OF

03:17:58.766 --> 03:18:00.068
WHAT KIND OF ACTIVITY THERE IS

03:18:00.134 --> 03:18:02.303
ON TEN BY TENS. IF I GET 100

03:18:02.370 --> 03:18:05.073
CALLS A DAY ON TEN BY TENS, AND

03:18:05.139 --> 03:18:07.542
I HAVE ONE LEFT, I INCREASE THE

03:18:07.609 --> 03:18:10.111
PRICE OF THAT ONE BECAUSE I WANT

03:18:10.178 --> 03:18:12.447
TO BE EFFICIENT AND I WANT TO

03:18:12.513 --> 03:18:15.183
CAPITALIZE ON THAT. THAT DEMAND

03:18:15.250 --> 03:18:17.318
JUST THE REVERSE. WE LOWER

03:18:17.385 --> 03:18:19.187
PRICES AS FREQUENTLY, IF NOT

03:18:19.254 --> 03:18:21.055
MORE, THAN WE RAISE PRICES,

03:18:21.122 --> 03:18:23.558
BECAUSE IF THERE'S TOO MUCH

03:18:23.625 --> 03:18:26.828
SUPPLY, THE BIGGEST CONCERN THAT

03:18:26.894 --> 03:18:29.631
SELF STORAGE HAS IS NEW

03:18:29.697 --> 03:18:30.164
DEVELOPMENTS IN ANY GIVEN

03:18:30.231 --> 03:18:32.834
MARKET. NEW DEVELOPMENT

03:18:32.900 --> 03:18:34.402
INTRODUCES A THOUSAND MORE UNITS

03:18:34.469 --> 03:18:36.537
INTO A MARKET. THOSE THOUSAND

03:18:36.604 --> 03:18:38.640
UNITS NEED TO RENT UP. THEY'RE

03:18:38.706 --> 03:18:40.275
GOING TO OFFER LOW PRICING IN

03:18:40.341 --> 03:18:42.110
ORDER TO GET CUSTOMERS IN THE

03:18:42.176 --> 03:18:44.545
SEATS. AND MY PRICES NEED TO GO

03:18:44.612 --> 03:18:46.114
DOWN IN ORDER TO BE COMPETITIVE.

03:18:46.180 --> 03:18:48.316
SO IT'S ALL SIMPLY A MATTER OF

03:18:48.383 --> 03:18:51.552
SUPPLY DEMAND. WELL, THE LATTER

03:18:51.619 --> 03:18:53.321
EXAMPLE IS CERTAINLY A SLOWER

03:18:53.388 --> 03:18:55.923
MOVING EXAMPLE. BUILD UNITS AND

03:18:55.990 --> 03:18:59.494
BRING THEM ON TARGET. WELL, IF

03:18:59.560 --> 03:19:00.728
WE REALLY GOT TO TRY TO FINISH

03:19:00.795 --> 03:19:02.730
BEFORE NOON. SO IF YOU GUYS WANT

03:19:02.797 --> 03:19:04.132
TO HAVE I'M HAPPY TO ALLOW

03:19:04.198 --> 03:19:06.000
FURTHER CONVERSATION. BUT YEAH,

03:19:06.067 --> 03:19:08.369
ASK A FOLLOW UP QUESTION ABOUT

03:19:08.436 --> 03:19:10.805
WHAT THIS MIGHT DO TO STORAGE

03:19:10.872 --> 03:19:12.073
WARS, BUT I THINK I'VE GOT TO GO

03:19:12.140 --> 03:19:13.141
PRESENT ANOTHER COMMITTEE. SO I

03:19:13.207 --> 03:19:14.709
WOULD JUST SAY THAT THE AUTHOR

03:19:14.776 --> 03:19:16.511
HAS MOVED ON THIS. IT STARTED

03:19:16.577 --> 03:19:17.912
WITH THE RENT CAP, BASICALLY

03:19:17.979 --> 03:19:20.114
MOVED ON EVERYTHING I AGREE WITH

03:19:20.181 --> 03:19:22.216
THE SUMMER 12 MONTHS IS ENTIRELY

03:19:22.283 --> 03:19:23.618
REASONABLE. I RENT FROM THESE

03:19:23.685 --> 03:19:25.053
PLACES. RENT WENT UP TWO TIMES

03:19:25.119 --> 03:19:26.754
IN LESS THAN THREE YEARS BECAUSE

03:19:26.821 --> 03:19:27.922
THERE'S NO ACCOUNTABILITY. THIS

03:19:27.989 --> 03:19:29.457
HAS NOT CHANGED THAT. AND WHAT'S

03:19:29.524 --> 03:19:31.225
GOING TO FORCE THEM TO NOT PUT

03:19:31.292 --> 03:19:33.328
TOO HIGH OF A ONE YEAR INCREASE,

03:19:33.394 --> 03:19:35.563
I THINK IS A BASIC CONSUMER

03:19:35.630 --> 03:19:36.698
TRANSPARENCY BILL. YOU SHOULD

03:19:36.764 --> 03:19:38.066
KNOW IN ONE YEAR HOW MUCH CAN

03:19:38.132 --> 03:19:39.400
THEY RAISE IT, WHAT'S GOING TO

03:19:39.467 --> 03:19:42.070
FORCE IT TO KEEP IT FROM GOING

03:19:42.136 --> 03:19:43.237
THROUGH THE ROOF IS MARKET

03:19:43.304 --> 03:19:44.372
COMPETITION. IF THEY CAN GO DOWN

03:19:44.439 --> 03:19:46.040
THE STREET AND SAY, WELL, THE

03:19:46.107 --> 03:19:48.343
MAXIMUM THAT ONE'S GOING IS X

03:19:48.409 --> 03:19:48.976
PERCENT AND THAT'S WHAT'S GOING

03:19:49.043 --> 03:19:50.645
TO DO IT. BUT ANYWAY, I SUPPORT

03:19:50.712 --> 03:19:51.612
THE BILL. WOULD YOU LIKE TO

03:19:51.679 --> 03:19:53.247
CLOSE? I THINK THE ROBUST

03:19:53.314 --> 03:19:54.182
CONVERSATION REALLY DID THE

03:19:54.248 --> 03:19:55.750
CLOSE FOR ME. I REALLY

03:19:55.817 --> 03:19:58.086
APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS AND

03:19:58.152 --> 03:20:00.521
CONVERSATIONS, JUST RESPECTFULLY

03:20:00.588 --> 03:20:01.422
ASKING FOR MY VOTE. THANK YOU.

03:20:01.489 --> 03:20:03.925

OUT. ALL RIGHT. OUR LAST BILL IS

03:20:33.955 --> 03:20:37.892
SENATOR RUBIO'S SENATE BILL 841.

03:20:37.959 --> 03:20:41.229
THE BILL? REBECCA, I THINK I

03:20:41.295 --> 03:20:43.965
HEARD MOVE THE BILL. YES. YOU

03:20:44.031 --> 03:20:45.166
HAVE A SECOND. I WILL SECOND

03:20:45.233 --> 03:20:50.304
THAT IDIOT. OKAY. OUR LAST BILL,

03:20:50.371 --> 03:20:54.442
SENATOR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU

03:20:54.509 --> 03:20:59.046
FOR YOUR PATIENCE. OKAY. THANK

03:20:59.113 --> 03:21:03.618
YOU. GOT IT. THANK YOU. HI.

03:21:03.684 --> 03:21:07.355
THANK YOU. WHOEVER IS VICE CHAIR

03:21:07.422 --> 03:21:09.123
AT THIS POINT. BUT THERE YOU

03:21:09.190 --> 03:21:11.225
ARE, DIANE. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

03:21:11.292 --> 03:21:12.427
AND THANK YOU, MEMBERS. I KNOW

03:21:12.493 --> 03:21:14.128
YOU GUYS ARE ALREADY TIRED, BUT

03:21:14.195 --> 03:21:15.163
TODAY I'M REALLY HONORED TO

03:21:15.229 --> 03:21:18.065
PRESENT SB 841, THE KEEP SAFE

03:21:18.132 --> 03:21:20.101
SPACES SAFE ACT. AS A SURVIVOR

03:21:20.168 --> 03:21:21.469
OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND AS A

03:21:21.536 --> 03:21:23.104
VICTIMS ADVOCATE, I KNOW HOW

03:21:23.171 --> 03:21:25.072
IMPORTANT IT IS FOR VICTIMS TO

03:21:25.139 --> 03:21:27.108
HAVE A SAFE PLACE TO GO AND

03:21:27.175 --> 03:21:28.276
ALWAYS FEEL LIKE THEY'RE GOING

03:21:28.342 --> 03:21:30.311
TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. AND THIS

03:21:30.378 --> 03:21:32.046
BILL IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT

03:21:32.113 --> 03:21:32.647
BECAUSE IT REALLY DOES SEND A

03:21:32.713 --> 03:21:34.248
MESSAGE TO VICTIMS THAT WE STAND

03:21:34.315 --> 03:21:36.317
WITH THEM. PLACES LIKE DOMESTIC

03:21:36.384 --> 03:21:38.186
VIOLENCE SHELTERS, HOMELESS

03:21:38.252 --> 03:21:40.455
SHELTERS, RAPE CRISIS CENTERS,

03:21:40.521 --> 03:21:42.123
FAMILY JUSTICE CENTERS, AND

03:21:42.190 --> 03:21:43.958
HUMAN TRAFFICKING SERVICE

03:21:44.025 --> 03:21:45.993
PROVIDERS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO

03:21:46.060 --> 03:21:47.895
WORRY THAT IF THEY GO TO ONE OF

03:21:47.962 --> 03:21:48.996
THESE FACILITIES, THAT THEY MAY

03:21:49.063 --> 03:21:51.866
BE DISRUPTED BY SOMEONE

03:21:51.933 --> 03:21:54.302
ENTERING. AND SO THESE LOCATIONS

03:21:54.368 --> 03:21:56.103
ARE MEANT TO BE SAFE SPACES OF

03:21:56.170 --> 03:21:57.805
HEALING. THEY'RE MEANT TO BE

03:21:57.872 --> 03:21:59.040
PLACES OF RECOVERY. AND PEOPLE

03:21:59.106 --> 03:22:02.276
GOING TO THESE CENTERS VERY

03:22:02.343 --> 03:22:04.378
VULNERABLE WITH A LOT OF TRAUMA.

03:22:04.445 --> 03:22:06.881
SO TODAY, THIS IS EVEN MORE

03:22:06.948 --> 03:22:08.683
IMPORTANT BECAUSE SOME VICTIMS

03:22:08.749 --> 03:22:10.518
ARE NOT GOING BECAUSE OF FEAR OF

03:22:10.585 --> 03:22:12.386
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT. AND SO

03:22:12.453 --> 03:22:14.455
THAT'S KEEPING THEM AWAY. AND I

03:22:14.522 --> 03:22:16.691
FEEL THAT IF WE DON'T ALLOW

03:22:16.757 --> 03:22:18.192
VICTIMS TO GO INTO THESE PLACES,

03:22:18.259 --> 03:22:20.261
WE'VE ALREADY FAILED THEM AS

03:22:20.328 --> 03:22:22.830
ADVOCATES. ABUSERS USUALLY WILL

03:22:22.897 --> 03:22:25.800
USE DIFFERENT THINGS TO KEEP

03:22:25.867 --> 03:22:27.635
THEIR VICTIMS IN HARM'S WAY. AND

03:22:27.702 --> 03:22:29.604
SO ABUSERS IN PARTICULAR WILL

03:22:29.670 --> 03:22:31.138
USE IMMIGRATION, FOR EXAMPLE, AS

03:22:31.205 --> 03:22:32.974
A WEAPON TO KEEP THEM COERCED.

03:22:33.040 --> 03:22:34.442
THEY THREATEN THE VICTIMS THAT

03:22:34.509 --> 03:22:36.277
THEY'RE GOING TO CALL EYES OR

03:22:36.344 --> 03:22:38.312
WE'LL GET THEM DEPORTED. AND SO

03:22:38.379 --> 03:22:40.848
THEY HAVE A MUCH HARDER TIME

03:22:40.915 --> 03:22:42.550
ESCAPING THEIR ABUSE. SO THIS IS

03:22:42.617 --> 03:22:43.985
NOT HYPOTHETICAL. WE'VE SEEN

03:22:44.051 --> 03:22:46.287
MANY CASES RECENTLY. IT'S

03:22:46.354 --> 03:22:47.889
HAPPENING AS I GET REPORTS OFTEN

03:22:47.955 --> 03:22:49.457
OF WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE

03:22:49.524 --> 03:22:51.259
GROUND LEVEL. SO JUST RECENTLY I

03:22:51.325 --> 03:22:53.528
HAD ONE CASE IN WHICH A DOMESTIC

03:22:53.594 --> 03:22:55.296
VIOLENCE VICTIM WAS SUPPOSED TO

03:22:55.363 --> 03:22:57.398
GO WITH THEIR SERVICE PROVIDER

03:22:57.465 --> 03:23:00.668
TO GET HELP. AND AFTER THE

03:23:00.735 --> 03:23:02.336
ABUSER THREATENED THIS PERSON,

03:23:02.403 --> 03:23:04.639
THEY WERE GOING TO CALL ICE AND

03:23:04.705 --> 03:23:05.706
GET DEPORTED. THE SERVICE

03:23:05.773 --> 03:23:06.774
PROVIDER NEVER HEARD FROM THE

03:23:06.841 --> 03:23:08.409
VICTIM AGAIN, SO MOST LIKELY

03:23:08.476 --> 03:23:09.810
THEY WENT BACK WITH THE ABUSER

03:23:09.877 --> 03:23:11.178
AND THEY'RE STILL THEY'RE

03:23:11.245 --> 03:23:13.614
TRAPPED AND MOST LIKELY BEING

03:23:13.681 --> 03:23:16.150
ASSAULTED. SO SB 841 WILL

03:23:16.217 --> 03:23:18.486
PROTECT ALL VICTIMS FROM THIS

03:23:18.553 --> 03:23:19.820
TYPE OF COERCIVE CONTROL AND

03:23:19.887 --> 03:23:22.290
WILL PROTECT NOT ONLY DOMESTIC

03:23:22.356 --> 03:23:23.691
VIOLENCE, AS I MENTIONED, BUT

03:23:23.758 --> 03:23:25.026
FIVE OTHER CRITICAL LOCATIONS

03:23:25.092 --> 03:23:26.694
THAT ARE ALSO IMPORTANT TO

03:23:26.761 --> 03:23:28.663
ENSURE THAT PEOPLE STAY SAFE SO

03:23:28.729 --> 03:23:30.264
THAT PEOPLE WHO NEED TO ACCESS

03:23:30.331 --> 03:23:32.733
THESE LOCATIONS DON'T FEAR THE

03:23:32.800 --> 03:23:35.202
TRAUMA, WHICH IS OFTEN CAUSED

03:23:35.269 --> 03:23:38.039
BY, YOU KNOW, ENFORCEMENT

03:23:38.105 --> 03:23:39.907
AGENCIES GOING INTO THESE

03:23:39.974 --> 03:23:42.310
FACILITIES. SB 841 ACCOMPLISHES

03:23:42.376 --> 03:23:44.478
THIS BY JUST CLARIFYING SIMPLY

03:23:44.545 --> 03:23:46.147
THAT EMPLOYEES AT THESE FIVE

03:23:46.213 --> 03:23:47.715
CRITICAL LOCATIONS MUST REFUSE

03:23:47.782 --> 03:23:50.051
ACCESS TO A NONPUBLIC AREA FOR

03:23:50.117 --> 03:23:51.485
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT

03:23:51.552 --> 03:23:53.187
ACTIVITIES UNLESS THEY'RE

03:23:53.254 --> 03:23:54.589
PRESENTED WITH A VALID, YOU

03:23:54.655 --> 03:23:56.857
KNOW, ENFORCEMENT DOCUMENTATION,

03:23:56.924 --> 03:23:59.327
VALID IDENTIFICATION, A WRITTEN

03:23:59.393 --> 03:24:01.429
STATEMENT OF PURPOSE AND A VALID

03:24:01.495 --> 03:24:03.664
JUDICIAL WARRANT OR COURT ORDER.

03:24:03.731 --> 03:24:05.499
I OFTEN THINK OF NOT ONLY THE

03:24:05.566 --> 03:24:06.400
VICTIMS, BUT THE CHILDREN THAT

03:24:06.467 --> 03:24:08.436
ARE WITH THEM. AND, YOU KNOW, AS

03:24:08.502 --> 03:24:10.137
A TEACHER, I CAN SHARE WITH YOU

03:24:10.204 --> 03:24:11.339
ALL THE STORIES THAT WE'RE

03:24:11.405 --> 03:24:13.374
HEARING ABOUT OUR STUDENTS BEING

03:24:13.441 --> 03:24:14.475
TRAUMATIZED BY WHAT THEY'RE

03:24:14.542 --> 03:24:16.310
SEEING. AND SO WE DON'T NEED

03:24:16.377 --> 03:24:19.113
THESE FAMILIES WHO ARE ALREADY

03:24:19.180 --> 03:24:22.783

03:25:37.625 --> 03:25:38.726
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND

03:25:38.793 --> 03:25:42.263

03:25:42.329 --> 03:25:44.632
EXTREMELY VALUABLE AND IS NEEDED

03:25:44.699 --> 03:25:45.933

CONNECTION TO RESOURCES THAT

03:25:50.671 --> 03:25:52.807

SPACES SAFE ACT AUTHORED BY

03:25:59.413 --> 03:26:02.416
SENATOR RUBIO, SB 841 RECOGNIZES

03:26:02.483 --> 03:26:04.285
THAT IMMIGRANT SURVIVORS ALREADY

03:26:04.351 --> 03:26:06.020
FACE MAJOR BARRIERS WHEN

03:26:06.087 --> 03:26:08.122
ACCESSING CARE AFTER AND AFTER

03:26:08.189 --> 03:26:10.024
RECENT POLICY CHANGES. THEY

03:26:10.091 --> 03:26:11.358
MIGHT BE EVEN LESS LIKELY TO

03:26:11.425 --> 03:26:13.360
SEEK OUT ASSISTANCE DUE TO FEAR

03:26:13.427 --> 03:26:16.197
OF DETENTION AND DEPORTATION.

03:26:16.263 --> 03:26:18.632
WE'VE SEEN THESE EFFECTS

03:26:18.699 --> 03:26:19.734
FIRSTHAND OVER THE LAST FEW

03:26:19.800 --> 03:26:21.469
WEEKS ALONE. WE HAVE SEEN A

03:26:21.535 --> 03:26:23.003
SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN CALLS

03:26:23.070 --> 03:26:25.539
FROM IMMIGRANT SURVIVORS. WE'VE

03:26:25.606 --> 03:26:27.608
ALSO HEARD CLIENTS SKIPPING

03:26:27.675 --> 03:26:28.943
RESTRAINING ORDER, RESTRAINING

03:26:29.009 --> 03:26:30.911
ORDER COURTS AND AVOIDING FAMILY

03:26:30.978 --> 03:26:32.580
LAW COURT AS A WHOLE. THEY ARE

03:26:32.646 --> 03:26:34.415
ALSO REFUSING TO CALL LAW

03:26:34.482 --> 03:26:35.816
ENFORCEMENT OUT OF FEAR OF THEIR

03:26:35.883 --> 03:26:37.752
INFORMATION BEING TURNED OVER TO

03:26:37.818 --> 03:26:39.153
ICE. ADDITIONALLY, MANY OF THESE

03:26:39.220 --> 03:26:40.888
FOLKS, MANY OF THESE MOM DADS

03:26:40.955 --> 03:26:43.124
AND CHILDREN ARE ISOLATING

03:26:43.190 --> 03:26:44.558
THEMSELVES FURTHER, TOO AFRAID

03:26:44.625 --> 03:26:46.360
TO LEAVE THEIR HOME OR ACCESS

03:26:46.427 --> 03:26:48.496
RESOURCES CLOSE TO THEM. I'D

03:26:48.562 --> 03:26:50.030
LIKE TO SHARE A FEW OF THE

03:26:50.097 --> 03:26:51.599
THINGS I'VE HEARD DIRECTLY FROM

03:26:51.665 --> 03:26:53.200
OUR CLIENTS. I HAVE A MOM WHO

03:26:53.267 --> 03:26:54.668
SHARED THAT SHE'S NOT FOLLOWED

03:26:54.735 --> 03:26:56.070
UP ON REFERRALS BECAUSE OF OUR

03:26:56.137 --> 03:26:58.572
PROXIMITY TO THE COURT. ANOTHER

03:26:58.639 --> 03:27:00.808
FAMILY HAS BEEN HESITANT ON

03:27:00.875 --> 03:27:02.209
FILING AND CALLING LAW

03:27:02.276 --> 03:27:03.344
ENFORCEMENT FOR VARIOUS

03:27:03.410 --> 03:27:05.146
RESTRAINING ORDER VIOLATIONS DUE

03:27:05.212 --> 03:27:07.648
TO FEAR OF INVOLVING THE POLICE.

03:27:07.715 --> 03:27:09.250
WE HAVE FAMILIES WHO HAVE ALSO

03:27:09.316 --> 03:27:11.118
SHARED THEIR HALTING U-VISA

03:27:11.185 --> 03:27:12.386
APPLICATIONS, AS THEY'RE TOO

03:27:12.453 --> 03:27:13.721
AFRAID TO APPEAR IN COURT

03:27:13.788 --> 03:27:15.189
THEMSELVES. OTHERS SHARE THAT

03:27:15.256 --> 03:27:18.826
THEY ARE AFRAID OF BEING HAVING

03:27:18.893 --> 03:27:20.961
THESE SERVICES SEEN AS PUBLIC

03:27:21.028 --> 03:27:22.363
CHARGES. SO THE ANXIETY RUNS

03:27:22.429 --> 03:27:24.198
DEEP AND WE ARE SEEING THESE

03:27:24.265 --> 03:27:25.633
LASTING EFFECTS ON FAMILIES AND

03:27:25.699 --> 03:27:27.468
CHILDREN, AND AS SUCH ARE

03:27:27.535 --> 03:27:28.903
HEARING THE RUMORS OF ICE

03:27:28.969 --> 03:27:30.437
ACTIVITY SPREADING. AND IT IS

03:27:30.504 --> 03:27:32.106
HARD TO REASSURE CLIENTS THAT

03:27:32.173 --> 03:27:34.008
THEY ARE SAFE, EVEN IN OUR

03:27:34.074 --> 03:27:35.876
CENTERS. AS SUCH. I URGE YOUR

03:27:35.943 --> 03:27:38.679
AYE VOTE ON SB 841. THANK YOU.

03:27:38.746 --> 03:27:40.114

IMMIGRANT RIGHTS. AND WE ARE

03:27:48.255 --> 03:27:49.323
PROUD CO-SPONSOR OF THIS BILL,

03:27:49.390 --> 03:27:51.091
WHICH PROVIDE PROTOCOLS FOR

03:27:51.158 --> 03:27:52.459
SHELTERS TO FOLLOW SHOULD THEY

03:27:52.526 --> 03:27:53.928
BE SUBJECT TO IMMIGRATION

03:27:53.994 --> 03:27:55.696
ENFORCEMENT. THIS BILL NOT ONLY

03:27:55.763 --> 03:27:57.064
ENSURES STATEWIDE UNIFORMITY,

03:27:57.131 --> 03:27:58.632
BUT ALSO ENHANCES PUBLIC SAFETY

03:27:58.699 --> 03:28:00.467
FOR ALL CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS AND

03:28:00.534 --> 03:28:01.836
ENSURES THAT EXTREMELY

03:28:01.902 --> 03:28:03.304
VULNERABLE CAN SEEK SHELTER WHEN

03:28:03.370 --> 03:28:04.405

PRACTICING IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY,

ALMOST 30 YEARS IN PRACTICE, AND

03:28:09.510 --> 03:28:11.345
WE HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE

03:28:11.412 --> 03:28:12.613
THE MOMENT THAT WE'RE LIVING IN

03:28:12.680 --> 03:28:13.981
RIGHT NOW. THE UNPRECEDENTED

03:28:14.048 --> 03:28:15.916
ATTACKS, AN ALL OUT WAR AGAINST

03:28:15.983 --> 03:28:18.252
IMMIGRANTS IS REALLY IS

03:28:18.319 --> 03:28:20.387
HAPPENING HERE ON THE GROUND

03:28:20.454 --> 03:28:21.355
HERE IN LOS ANGELES. AND I CAN

03:28:21.422 --> 03:28:23.390
SAFELY SAY THAT FOLKS ARE

03:28:23.457 --> 03:28:25.292
REALLY, REALLY FEEL A LOT OF

03:28:25.359 --> 03:28:26.293
MISTRUST WITH LOCAL LAW

03:28:26.360 --> 03:28:28.896
ENFORCEMENT, AS WE SEE NOT ONLY

03:28:28.963 --> 03:28:30.698
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT, BUT WE

03:28:30.764 --> 03:28:34.602
ALSO SEE LAPD. OUT ON THE

03:28:34.668 --> 03:28:38.973
STREETS ALONG WITH, YOU KNOW,

03:28:39.039 --> 03:28:43.410
THE FBI, ATF, DEA, US MARSHALS

03:28:43.477 --> 03:28:46.881
AND OTHER ENTITIES SPECIFICALLY

03:28:46.947 --> 03:28:49.817
TARGETING RAIDS AND FOLKS WITHIN

03:28:49.884 --> 03:28:51.652
OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES ON THE

03:28:51.719 --> 03:28:53.587
STREETS OF LOS ANGELES, AS WELL

03:28:53.654 --> 03:28:55.322
AS PLACES LIKE NURSING HOMES AND

03:28:55.389 --> 03:28:57.324
OTHER FACILITIES. AND SO IT'S

03:28:57.391 --> 03:28:58.392
REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND

03:28:58.459 --> 03:29:00.561
SORT OF WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THE

03:29:00.628 --> 03:29:01.996
GROUND RIGHT NOW IN LOS ANGELES

03:29:02.062 --> 03:29:02.630
AS WE'RE HERE TODAY. IT'S IT

03:29:02.696 --> 03:29:04.198
WOULD IT'S IT BEHOOVES ME TO

03:29:04.265 --> 03:29:06.066
SPEAK TO THIS JUST BECAUSE WE

03:29:06.133 --> 03:29:07.935
CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT, THIS

03:29:08.002 --> 03:29:08.535
CONTEXT WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING

03:29:08.602 --> 03:29:09.737
THE IMPORTANCE AND SIGNIFICANCE

03:29:09.803 --> 03:29:11.705
OF THIS BILL. WE REALLY DO NEED

03:29:11.772 --> 03:29:13.107
TO UNDERSTAND THAT VICTIMS OF

03:29:13.173 --> 03:29:14.208
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, AS WELL AS

03:29:14.275 --> 03:29:17.578
OTHER FOLKS, DO NEED TO CALL,

03:29:17.645 --> 03:29:19.613
OFTEN NEED TO RESORT TO CALLING

03:29:19.680 --> 03:29:20.781
LAW ENFORCEMENT. YET THIS

03:29:20.848 --> 03:29:22.549
MOMENT, THAT TRUST IS REALLY

03:29:22.616 --> 03:29:23.651
ERODED, GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE

03:29:23.717 --> 03:29:25.686
ARE SEEING MILITARIZED

03:29:25.753 --> 03:29:26.887
ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS ON THE

03:29:26.954 --> 03:29:29.356
GROUND TO DATE, THE

03:29:29.423 --> 03:29:30.024
ADMINISTRATION, THE TRUMP

03:29:30.090 --> 03:29:31.892
ADMINISTRATION HAS OVER 240

03:29:31.959 --> 03:29:33.294
POLICY ACTIONS THAT THEY HAVE

03:29:33.360 --> 03:29:34.595
TAKEN TO TARGET IMMIGRANTS IN

03:29:34.662 --> 03:29:36.430
ONE OF THE LARGEST DEPORTATION

03:29:36.497 --> 03:29:38.065
EFFORTS IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY.

03:29:38.132 --> 03:29:39.967
RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE OVER 51,000

03:29:40.034 --> 03:29:42.069
FOLKS IN DETENTION WITH PLANS TO

03:29:42.136 --> 03:29:43.771
EXPAND CAPACITY IN PLACES LIKE

03:29:43.837 --> 03:29:46.640
KERN AND ADELANTO. FOR THESE

03:29:46.707 --> 03:29:48.409
REASONS, AS STATED PREVIOUSLY,

03:29:48.475 --> 03:29:49.777
IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE

03:29:49.843 --> 03:29:51.412
REBUILD THE TRUST. IT IS GOING

03:29:51.478 --> 03:29:53.180
TO TAKE GENERATIONS TO REBUILD

03:29:53.247 --> 03:29:54.915
THE TRUST THAT IMMIGRANT

03:29:54.982 --> 03:29:56.450
COMMUNITIES HAVE NOW FEAR,

03:29:56.517 --> 03:29:58.485
BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT WE ARE

03:29:58.552 --> 03:29:59.286
SEEING IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT

03:29:59.353 --> 03:30:01.055
TAKE PLACE ON THE GROUND. AND SO

03:30:01.121 --> 03:30:03.590
THESE PROTOCOLS ARE, AS I

03:30:03.657 --> 03:30:04.959

03:30:54.775 --> 03:30:57.578
YES, MADAM. PACHECO, PLEASE.

03:30:57.644 --> 03:31:00.381
THANK YOU. AND, SENATOR, THANK

03:31:00.447 --> 03:31:01.949
YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS

03:31:02.016 --> 03:31:04.518
BILL FORWARD. I'M SEEING IT IN

03:31:04.585 --> 03:31:06.520
MY ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. ALL THESE

03:31:06.587 --> 03:31:09.556
ICE RAIDS HAPPENING. I'M IN THE

03:31:09.623 --> 03:31:10.958
64TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT, WHICH IS

03:31:11.025 --> 03:31:13.327
PARTS OF L.A. COUNTY, AND A

03:31:13.394 --> 03:31:15.262
LITTLE BIT OF ORANGE COUNTY. AND

03:31:15.329 --> 03:31:17.631
I LIVE AND REPRESENT THE CITY OF

03:31:17.698 --> 03:31:20.200
DOWNEY. AND WE HAVE SEEN RAIDS

03:31:20.267 --> 03:31:23.871
AT CHURCHES, CAR WASHES, HOME

03:31:23.937 --> 03:31:27.274
DEPOTS, NEAR SCHOOLS. ALSO, I

03:31:27.341 --> 03:31:29.676
JUST RECENTLY HEARD ABOUT KAISER

03:31:29.743 --> 03:31:32.179
IN DOWNEY, SO IT FEELS LIKE

03:31:32.246 --> 03:31:34.181
THERE'S NO SAFE PLACE AND

03:31:34.248 --> 03:31:36.116
THEY'RE GOING EVERYWHERE. AND

03:31:36.183 --> 03:31:37.284
THERE ARE PEOPLE ARE JUST

03:31:37.351 --> 03:31:38.919
GETTING STOPPED BECAUSE THEY'RE

03:31:38.986 --> 03:31:40.621
BROWN AND THEY'RE BEING ASKED IF

03:31:40.687 --> 03:31:43.590
THEY'RE CITIZENS. IT'S INSANE.

03:31:43.657 --> 03:31:45.626
THE WORLD THAT WE ARE LIVING IN,

03:31:45.692 --> 03:31:48.729
AND I COULDN'T EVEN IMAGINE IN

03:31:48.796 --> 03:31:51.098
MY WILDEST DREAMS THAT WE'D BE

03:31:51.165 --> 03:31:53.033
IN THE SITUATION THAT WE'RE IN.

03:31:53.100 --> 03:31:55.069
AND IT'S REALLY SAD BECAUSE

03:31:55.135 --> 03:31:56.370
THERE'S MEMBERS IN MY COMMUNITY,

03:31:56.437 --> 03:31:59.506
I REPRESENT CLOSE TO 75% LATINO.

03:31:59.573 --> 03:32:00.841
THERE'S MEMBERS IN MY COMMUNITY

03:32:00.908 --> 03:32:04.278
WHO ARE AFRAID TO GO SHOPPING TO

03:32:04.344 --> 03:32:06.213
GO TO THE GROCERY STORE. AND SO

03:32:06.280 --> 03:32:08.082
I HAVE COUNCIL MEMBERS WITHIN MY

03:32:08.148 --> 03:32:10.284
ASSEMBLY DISTRICT WHO ARE DOING

03:32:10.350 --> 03:32:12.553
FOOD DELIVERIES SO THAT PEOPLE

03:32:12.619 --> 03:32:14.221
CAN GET WHATEVER THEY NEED FROM

03:32:14.288 --> 03:32:16.457
THE STORE. SO I COMMEND YOU FOR

03:32:16.523 --> 03:32:17.424
HAVING THIS BILL, FOR BRINGING

03:32:17.491 --> 03:32:19.226
THIS BILL FORWARD, AND I WOULD

03:32:19.293 --> 03:32:21.328
LOVE TO BE ADDED AS A COAUTHOR.

03:32:21.395 --> 03:32:23.931
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER

03:32:23.997 --> 03:32:29.670
SPEAKERS FROM THE COMMITTEE? MR.

03:32:29.736 --> 03:32:31.605
LU N? I JUST HAD A JUST A COUPLE

03:32:31.672 --> 03:32:35.409
OF CLARITY QUESTIONS. SURE. SO

03:32:35.476 --> 03:32:37.377
WHAT HAPPENS? AND I DO BELIEVE

03:32:37.444 --> 03:32:39.079
SOME OF IT IS ADDRESSED. BUT IF

03:32:39.146 --> 03:32:41.281
YOU CAN EXPLAIN IT TO ME, WHAT

03:32:41.348 --> 03:32:44.051
HAPPENS IF AN EMPLOYEE DOES LET

03:32:44.118 --> 03:32:45.919
FEDERAL AGENT IN? OR MAYBE

03:32:45.986 --> 03:32:48.555
THEY'RE WORRIED ON THEIR END,

03:32:48.622 --> 03:32:51.091
WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM? WELL, LET

03:32:51.158 --> 03:32:53.160
ME JUST GO BACK A LITTLE BIT ON

03:32:53.227 --> 03:32:55.596
THE HISTORY. SO TRADITIONALLY

03:32:55.662 --> 03:32:57.798
THIS THESE WERE DESIGNATED SAFE

03:32:57.865 --> 03:33:00.300
SPACES. YOU KNOW, EVERY OTHER

03:33:00.367 --> 03:33:01.768
ADMINISTRATION TRADITIONALLY

03:33:01.835 --> 03:33:04.671
ALWAYS DESIGNATED THESE PLACES

03:33:04.738 --> 03:33:06.073
SAFE BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, NOT ONLY

03:33:06.140 --> 03:33:07.207
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS

03:33:07.274 --> 03:33:08.509
REALLY SIDING WITH THE CRIMINAL.

03:33:08.575 --> 03:33:09.943
WE WANT TO HOLD PERPETRATORS

03:33:10.010 --> 03:33:11.245
ACCOUNTABLE AND NOT GIVE THEM

03:33:11.311 --> 03:33:12.913
ANOTHER TOOL TO TERRORIZE THEIR

03:33:12.980 --> 03:33:15.415
VICTIMS. SO IN JANUARY, THE NEW

03:33:15.482 --> 03:33:16.483
ADMINISTRATION RESCINDED

03:33:16.550 --> 03:33:18.685
SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN IN PLACE

03:33:18.752 --> 03:33:19.786
TRADITIONALLY. SO THIS IS

03:33:19.853 --> 03:33:20.687
SOMETHING THAT'S NEVER BEEN

03:33:20.754 --> 03:33:22.489
DONE. WE'RE TRYING TO IMPLEMENT

03:33:22.556 --> 03:33:25.726
THIS TO ENSURE THAT THEY DON'T.

03:33:25.792 --> 03:33:28.795
THERE ARE NO NECESSARILY ALIGNED

03:33:28.862 --> 03:33:29.530
CONSEQUENCES HERE, BUT THEY

03:33:29.596 --> 03:33:31.899
SHOULD NOT. AND I THINK THAT

03:33:31.965 --> 03:33:33.167
THIS IS IN PLACE. IT WILL

03:33:33.233 --> 03:33:34.434
CONTINUE TO FUNCTION THE WAY

03:33:34.501 --> 03:33:36.270
IT'S FUNCTIONED FOR YEARS AND

03:33:36.336 --> 03:33:38.172
YEARS UNTIL JANUARY WHEN THE

03:33:38.238 --> 03:33:39.973
POLICY WAS RESCINDED. SO THIS

03:33:40.040 --> 03:33:41.341
WASN'T AN ISSUE BEFORE. SO I

03:33:41.408 --> 03:33:42.342
HOPE THAT ONCE WE IMPLEMENT IT

03:33:42.409 --> 03:33:44.678
BACK AS ITS TRADITIONAL FORM, IT

03:33:44.745 --> 03:33:46.713
WILL CONTINUE BEING A NON-ISSUE.

03:33:46.780 --> 03:33:48.182
YEAH. AND I JUST WANTED TO

03:33:48.248 --> 03:33:49.716
ADDRESS IT BECAUSE I JUST WORRY

03:33:49.783 --> 03:33:50.617
ABOUT SOME SOME OF THOSE

03:33:50.684 --> 03:33:52.119
COMMUNITIES THAT, YOU KNOW, WHEN

03:33:52.186 --> 03:33:53.720
WE HAVE CONFLICTING LAWS BOTH ON

03:33:53.787 --> 03:33:55.322
THE FEDERAL SIDE AND THEN ON THE

03:33:55.389 --> 03:33:57.257
STATE SIDE, I AGREE THAT I THINK

03:33:57.324 --> 03:33:59.860
IT DOES CREATE KIND OF THIS

03:33:59.927 --> 03:34:04.131
MESSY SITUATION, YOU KNOW, WHERE

03:34:04.198 --> 03:34:05.365
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:34:05.432 --> 03:34:07.968
THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE

03:34:08.035 --> 03:34:08.468
PROVIDING THESE AMAZING

03:34:08.535 --> 03:34:09.403
SERVICES, THEY'RE NOT CAUGHT UP

03:34:09.469 --> 03:34:11.872
WITH IT BECAUSE OF CONFLICTING

03:34:11.939 --> 03:34:13.607
FEDERAL LAW WITH CONFLICTING

03:34:13.674 --> 03:34:15.275
STATE LAW. AND I THINK THAT

03:34:15.342 --> 03:34:16.543
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE KIND OF SEEN,

03:34:16.610 --> 03:34:18.145
ESPECIALLY WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING

03:34:18.212 --> 03:34:19.846
WITH IMMIGRATION HERE IN THIS

03:34:19.913 --> 03:34:21.982
STATE, IS THAT THERE ISN'T

03:34:22.049 --> 03:34:23.250
COORDINATION BETWEEN THE FEDERAL

03:34:23.317 --> 03:34:24.551
AND THE STATE. THE STATE IS

03:34:24.618 --> 03:34:26.320
DRAWING A HARD LINE SAYING, WE

03:34:26.386 --> 03:34:28.055
WILL NOT WORK WITH FEDERAL

03:34:28.121 --> 03:34:29.256
GOVERNMENT. THEN THE FEDERAL

03:34:29.323 --> 03:34:30.824
GOVERNMENT HERE IN THIS STATE

03:34:30.891 --> 03:34:32.559
HAS TO CAST THESE BROAD NETS,

03:34:32.626 --> 03:34:35.362
WHICH ARE INCORPORATING SO MANY

03:34:35.429 --> 03:34:36.663
INDIVIDUALS THAT THEY PROBABLY

03:34:36.730 --> 03:34:38.865
WEREN'T INTENDED TO GO FOR. I

03:34:38.932 --> 03:34:40.033
MEAN, THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

03:34:40.100 --> 03:34:41.201
RESEARCH THAT IS BEING DONE

03:34:41.268 --> 03:34:44.004
RIGHT NOW. ON WHY HOME DEPOT HAS

03:34:44.071 --> 03:34:45.439
TO BE TARGETED. BECAUSE IF

03:34:45.505 --> 03:34:47.608
THEY'RE GOING AFTER SOMEBODY WHO

03:34:47.674 --> 03:34:51.912
IS A CHILD MOLESTER OR A RAPIST,

03:34:51.979 --> 03:34:53.680
THAT THEY THEN HAVE TO PRETTY

03:34:53.747 --> 03:34:56.617
MUCH LOOK THROUGH THE ENTIRE

03:34:56.683 --> 03:34:58.385
PROCESS BECAUSE THERE'S NO

03:34:58.452 --> 03:34:59.753
ADDITIONAL COORDINATION WITH

03:34:59.820 --> 03:35:01.655
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO HELP

03:35:01.722 --> 03:35:03.223
THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S

03:35:03.290 --> 03:35:04.291
TARGETED. SO IT CREATES THESE

03:35:04.358 --> 03:35:05.626
BROAD NETS, WHICH IS REALLY

03:35:05.692 --> 03:35:07.494
CREATING THIS VERY MESSY

03:35:07.561 --> 03:35:09.529
SITUATION THAT WE SEE. I ALSO

03:35:09.596 --> 03:35:10.998
JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:35:11.064 --> 03:35:12.099
WE'RE NOT MAKING INDIVIDUALS WHO

03:35:12.165 --> 03:35:14.501
ARE WORKING IN THESE AMAZING

03:35:14.568 --> 03:35:16.103
COMMUNITIES GET CAUGHT UP IN

03:35:16.169 --> 03:35:18.605
THIS MESSY SITUATION. SO I

03:35:18.672 --> 03:35:19.506
APPRECIATE THE CLARITY ON THAT

03:35:19.573 --> 03:35:21.508
ONE. CAN I OFFER SOMETHING?

03:35:21.575 --> 03:35:24.645
WELL, THANK YOU FOR APPRECIATING

03:35:24.711 --> 03:35:26.246
THE BILL. I AGREE WITH YOU. AND

03:35:26.313 --> 03:35:28.482
I THINK WHAT WE CAN DO IS MAYBE

03:35:28.548 --> 03:35:30.083
OFFER A SENTENCE OR TWO, MAYBE

03:35:30.150 --> 03:35:30.851
ADVISING SOME OF THESE

03:35:30.917 --> 03:35:33.353
FACILITIES TO SORT OF RETRAIN,

03:35:33.420 --> 03:35:35.422
YOU KNOW, THEIR THEIR EMPLOYEES

03:35:35.489 --> 03:35:36.590
TO UNDERSTAND THE NEW LAW AND

03:35:36.657 --> 03:35:38.358
WHAT'S EXPECTED OF THEM. I MEAN,

03:35:38.425 --> 03:35:40.093
I'M A TEACHER BY, YOU KNOW, BY

03:35:40.160 --> 03:35:41.862
TRADE. SO, YOU KNOW, WE GET

03:35:41.928 --> 03:35:42.929
BRIEFINGS ALL THE TIME OF

03:35:42.996 --> 03:35:44.398
CHANGING LAWS AND WHAT'S

03:35:44.464 --> 03:35:45.632
EXPECTED OF US. IT'S THE SAME

03:35:45.699 --> 03:35:47.668
THING OF ME NOT FOLLOWING

03:35:47.734 --> 03:35:49.136
PROTOCOL IN MY SCHOOL SETTING. I

03:35:49.202 --> 03:35:50.937
MEAN, I SHOULD BE DISCIPLINED

03:35:51.004 --> 03:35:53.073
FOR GOING CONTRARY TO WHAT MY

03:35:53.140 --> 03:35:54.808
PRINCIPLE OR MY SCHOOL DISTRICT

03:35:54.875 --> 03:35:56.710
EXPECTS OF ME. SO I COULD ADD A

03:35:56.777 --> 03:35:59.913
LINE OR TWO TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:35:59.980 --> 03:36:02.049
THERE IS SOME KIND OF BRIEFING

03:36:02.115 --> 03:36:03.183
FOR EMPLOYEES. SO THEY

03:36:03.250 --> 03:36:04.318
UNDERSTAND VERY CLEARLY WHAT THE

03:36:04.384 --> 03:36:06.053
LAW IS. BECAUSE I'M WITH YOU, WE

03:36:06.119 --> 03:36:07.187
DON'T WANT ANYONE TO BE CAUGHT

03:36:07.254 --> 03:36:09.323
UP WITH NOT KNOWING WHAT'S

03:36:09.389 --> 03:36:10.390
EXPECTED OF THEM. YEAH. AND

03:36:10.457 --> 03:36:12.426
THAT'S THAT'S THE PART THAT I,

03:36:12.492 --> 03:36:13.660
YOU KNOW, WHERE IT WOULD COME

03:36:13.727 --> 03:36:14.628
IN. JUST HOPEFUL THAT THE

03:36:14.695 --> 03:36:16.163
RETRAINING DOESN'T TRAIN THEM

03:36:16.229 --> 03:36:17.597
TO. YES. THEY COME INTO

03:36:17.664 --> 03:36:18.665
COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LAW, BUT

03:36:18.732 --> 03:36:20.200
IT MAKES THEM OUT OF COMPLIANCE

03:36:20.267 --> 03:36:22.669
OR IMPEDE FEDERAL OFFICERS. BUT

03:36:22.736 --> 03:36:24.271
CAN I SHARE WITH YOU REAL

03:36:24.338 --> 03:36:25.339
QUICKLY? IT IS VERY CLEAR HERE.

03:36:25.405 --> 03:36:27.607
IT'S NOT SAYING DO NOT LET THEM

03:36:27.674 --> 03:36:29.776
IN OBSTRUCT OR IMPEDE. THIS VERY

03:36:29.843 --> 03:36:32.045
CLEARLY STATES THAT THEY CAN

03:36:32.112 --> 03:36:33.347
ENTER. BUT AS WE'VE SEEN, YOU

03:36:33.413 --> 03:36:34.548
KNOW, LATELY, THEY'RE JUST

03:36:34.614 --> 03:36:35.515
GRABBING PEOPLE WITHOUT EVEN

03:36:35.582 --> 03:36:37.317
HAVING IDENTIFYING MARKERS ON

03:36:37.384 --> 03:36:39.786
THEIR VEST OR THEIR CARS OR, OR

03:36:39.853 --> 03:36:41.321
ANY WARRANTS. SO THIS JUST

03:36:41.388 --> 03:36:43.056
SIMPLY SAYS WE NEED TO GO BACK

03:36:43.123 --> 03:36:44.524
TO OUR TRADITIONAL WAY OF DOING

03:36:44.591 --> 03:36:46.460
THINGS. AND THAT IS YOU HAVE A

03:36:46.526 --> 03:36:48.962
FORMAL WARRANT WITH THE PROPER

03:36:49.029 --> 03:36:50.364
DOCUMENTATION AND PROPER

03:36:50.430 --> 03:36:51.031
IDENTIFICATION. THERE'S NO

03:36:51.098 --> 03:36:52.632
REASON WHY ANYONE SHOULD STOP

03:36:52.699 --> 03:36:54.101
THEM. THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO

03:36:54.167 --> 03:36:55.268
COMPLY. PERFECT. AND THAT'S WHY

03:36:55.335 --> 03:36:57.237
I JUST WANTED TO CLEAR, JUST TO

03:36:57.304 --> 03:36:58.472
MAKE SURE THAT THE INDIVIDUALS

03:36:58.538 --> 03:37:00.006
AND THE EMPLOYEES THERE, LIKE

03:37:00.073 --> 03:37:01.508
THERE WAS NO REPERCUSSIONS ON

03:37:01.575 --> 03:37:03.610
THEM FOR, YOU KNOW, POTENTIALLY

03:37:03.677 --> 03:37:05.512
ALLOWING THEM IN OR EVEN MAKING

03:37:05.579 --> 03:37:07.547
THAT MISTAKE ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL

03:37:07.614 --> 03:37:09.049
JUST NOT KNOWING. OH,

03:37:09.116 --> 03:37:10.817
ABSOLUTELY. I AGREE WITH YOU.

03:37:10.884 --> 03:37:12.386
WE'LL MAKE SURE TO ADD A LINE OR

03:37:12.452 --> 03:37:15.689
TWO ON THAT. THANK YOU. ANY

03:37:15.756 --> 03:37:19.593
OTHER QUESTIONS? NO, MA'AM. ALL

03:37:19.659 --> 03:37:23.663
RIGHT. I WISH I. WOULD. YOU LIKE

03:37:23.730 --> 03:37:25.699
TO MAKE YOUR CLOSING STATEMENT,

03:37:25.766 --> 03:37:26.400
PLEASE? WELL, YOU KNOW, I'LL

03:37:26.466 --> 03:37:28.201
JUST SAY THIS AS A VICTIM'S

03:37:28.268 --> 03:37:29.569
ADVOCATE, AS A VICTIM MYSELF, I

03:37:29.636 --> 03:37:31.405
THINK THAT IF YOU'RE NOT VOTING

03:37:31.471 --> 03:37:32.606
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS, YOU ARE
