00:59:27.397 --> 00:59:28.564
TECHNOLOGIES. WITH PUBLIC SAFETY

00:59:28.631 --> 00:59:31.467
IN MIND, I CONTINUE TO SUPPORT

00:59:31.534 --> 00:59:32.568
MODERNIZING THE PUBLIC SAFETY

00:59:32.635 --> 00:59:34.203
NEED TO TRANSITION FROM AN

00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:36.072
OUTDATED LANDLINE SYSTEM TO

00:59:36.139 --> 00:59:37.874
FIBER BASED NETWORKS IN AN

00:59:37.941 --> 00:59:39.008
APPROPRIATE AND ORDERLY, PHASED

00:59:39.075 --> 00:59:40.843
IN APPROACH, BECAUSE NO ONE

00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:42.211
SHOULD BE LEFT WITHOUT ACCESS TO

00:59:42.278 --> 00:59:44.380
COMMUNICATIONS OR 12-1 SERVICES,

00:59:44.447 --> 00:59:46.816
ESPECIALLY DURING AN EMERGENCY.

00:59:46.883 --> 00:59:48.685
THE RECENT AMENDMENTS GUARANTEES

00:59:48.751 --> 00:59:49.919
THAT THE MODERNIZATION PROCESS

00:59:49.986 --> 00:59:52.555
WILL BE OVERSEEN BY CPUC IN

00:59:52.622 --> 00:59:54.223
CONSULTATION WITH CAL OES, WHO

00:59:54.290 --> 00:59:56.659
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY

00:59:56.726 --> 00:59:57.527
COMMUNICATIONS AND TO ENSURE

00:59:57.593 --> 00:59:59.095
THAT PUBLIC SAFETY AND FIRST

00:59:59.162 --> 01:00:01.297
RESPONDERS INPUT IS REFLECTED IN

01:00:01.364 --> 01:00:03.766
ANY PROCESS THAT IS ADOPTED.

01:00:03.833 --> 01:00:05.101
ADDITIONALLY, THE COMMITMENT TO

01:00:05.168 --> 01:00:06.869
DEPLOY MODERN NETWORKS REQUIRED

01:00:06.936 --> 01:00:08.538
BY THE CALLER OF LAST RESORT

01:00:08.604 --> 01:00:10.173
SEEKING TO AMEND THEIR STATUS

01:00:10.239 --> 01:00:12.475

01:00:12.542 --> 01:00:14.477
SPECIFIC EMPHASIS PUT ON

01:00:14.544 --> 01:00:16.446
DEPLOYING FIBER IN AREAS THAT

01:00:16.512 --> 01:00:19.549
NEED IT MOST. THIS PUTS A

01:00:19.615 --> 01:00:21.117
QUANTIFIABLE INVESTMENT IN

01:00:21.184 --> 01:00:23.186
CALIFORNIA'S SHORT AND LONG TERM

01:00:23.252 --> 01:00:24.620
FUTURE, EXPANDING ACCESS TO THE

01:00:24.687 --> 01:00:26.489

LARGEST CARRIER OF LAST RESORT.

I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER

MCKINNON AND HER STAFF FOR THEIR

01:02:08.391 --> 01:02:09.759

01:02:09.826 --> 01:02:11.694
SPEAKER RIVAS AND HIS STAFF,

01:02:11.761 --> 01:02:13.696
CHAIR BURNER AND THE COMMITTEE

01:02:13.763 --> 01:02:15.198

01:02:15.264 --> 01:02:17.066
DEDICATION TO THIS IMPORTANT

01:02:17.133 --> 01:02:19.535
LEGISLATION. AB 470 REPRESENTS A

01:02:19.602 --> 01:02:20.903
THOUGHTFUL AND COMPREHENSIVE

01:02:20.970 --> 01:02:22.805
PATH TOWARD MODERNIZING

01:02:22.872 --> 01:02:24.207
CALIFORNIA'S OUTDATED VOICE

01:02:24.273 --> 01:02:26.075
COMMUNICATIONS POLICY. OUR

01:02:26.142 --> 01:02:27.777
CURRENT REGULATORY SYSTEM,

01:02:27.844 --> 01:02:29.712
ROOTED IN A MONOPOLY ERA MODEL,

01:02:29.779 --> 01:02:31.013
MANDATES THAT CARRIERS OF LAST

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:33.916
RESORT MAINTAIN LEGACY NETWORKS

01:02:33.983 --> 01:02:35.551
EVEN WHEN CUSTOMERS NO LONGER

01:02:35.618 --> 01:02:38.521
USE THEM. THIS POLICY NO LONGER

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:39.856
REFLECTS THE REALITY OF TODAY'S

01:02:39.922 --> 01:02:41.724
COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE.

01:02:41.791 --> 01:02:43.493
CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE

01:02:43.559 --> 01:02:45.294
AT&amp;T SERVES THAT STILL ENFORCES

01:02:45.361 --> 01:02:47.430
THIS OUTDATED REQUIREMENT. ALL

01:02:47.497 --> 01:02:49.232
OTHERS HAVE MOVED FORWARD,

01:02:49.298 --> 01:02:50.666
RECOGNIZING THE MODERN SERVICES

01:02:50.733 --> 01:02:52.268
LIKE FIBER BASED BROADBAND

01:02:52.335 --> 01:02:54.971
BETTER MEET CONSUMER NEEDS. OVER

01:02:55.037 --> 01:02:56.839
95% OF OUR CALIFORNIA CUSTOMERS

01:02:56.906 --> 01:02:58.074
HAVE ALREADY TRANSITIONED TO

01:02:58.141 --> 01:03:00.743
MODERN NETWORKS. AB 470 ENSURES

01:03:00.810 --> 01:03:02.945
THE REMAINING CUSTOMERS RETAIN

01:03:03.012 --> 01:03:05.047
SERVICE UNTIL WIRED AFFORDABLE

01:03:05.114 --> 01:03:06.649
ALTERNATIVE IS AVAILABLE. WITH

01:03:06.716 --> 01:03:08.317
STRONG CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN

01:03:08.384 --> 01:03:11.154
PLACE. AB 470 RECOGNIZES THAT

01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:12.989
NOT ALL AREAS OF THE STATE ARE

01:03:13.055 --> 01:03:14.724
WELL SERVED. THAT IS WHY THIS

01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:17.026
BILL ONLY PROVIDES A PATH TO

01:03:17.093 --> 01:03:18.327
REFORM IN AREAS OF THE STATE

01:03:18.394 --> 01:03:20.429
THAT ARE WELL SERVED BY OTHER

01:03:20.496 --> 01:03:22.465
PROVIDERS OR HAVE NO POPULATION.

01:03:22.532 --> 01:03:24.200
WITH THESE LATEST AMENDS, WHICH

01:03:24.267 --> 01:03:25.635
PLACES PROCESS FIRMLY WITHIN THE

01:03:25.701 --> 01:03:27.770
AUTHORITY OF THE PUC AND TRIPLE

01:03:27.837 --> 01:03:28.971
THE FIBER INVESTMENT

01:03:29.038 --> 01:03:30.072
REQUIREMENTS OF THE CORE

01:03:30.139 --> 01:03:31.841
COMPANY, THIS BILL GUARANTEES A

01:03:31.908 --> 01:03:33.242
PLAN THAT PROVIDES A PUBLIC

01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:34.577
BENEFIT WHILE MAINTAINING

01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:35.811
RELIABLE VOICE SERVICES FOR

01:03:35.878 --> 01:03:38.214
EVERY CALIFORNIAN. I

01:03:38.281 --> 01:03:39.215
RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT

01:03:39.282 --> 01:03:44.654
FOR THIS BILL. THANK YOU. THANK

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.088
YOU FOR THAT TESTIMONY. I

01:03:46.155 --> 01:03:49.392
BELIEVE WE ALREADY DID OTHER

01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:50.927
WITNESSES IN SUPPORT, SO WE'LL

01:03:50.993 --> 01:03:53.196
NOW BE MOVING ON TO THE TWO

01:03:53.262 --> 01:03:56.132
PRIMARY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION.

01:03:56.199 --> 01:03:58.601
REGINA COSTA WITH TURN AND A

01:03:58.668 --> 01:04:02.905
REPRESENTATIVE FROM CW. A PLEASE

01:04:02.972 --> 01:04:12.348
COME FORWARD. AND GO AHEAD AND

01:04:12.415 --> 01:04:19.388
BEGIN WHEN READY. GOOD

01:04:19.455 --> 01:04:20.456
AFTERNOON, MADAM CHAIR. MEMBERS

01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:21.791
OF THE COMMITTEE, I'M REGINA

01:04:21.857 --> 01:04:23.693
COSTA ON BEHALF OF TURN. FOR

01:04:23.759 --> 01:04:25.194
MORE THAN 50 YEARS, TURN HAS

01:04:25.261 --> 01:04:27.496
BEEN AN ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF

01:04:27.563 --> 01:04:29.498
RATEPAYERS, INCLUDING THE AT&amp;T

01:04:29.565 --> 01:04:31.334
APP ON THE AT&amp;T APPLICATION AND

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:32.535
THE CURRENT COACHELLA PROCEEDING

01:04:32.602 --> 01:04:34.670
AT THE COMMISSION. AND I LED THE

01:04:34.737 --> 01:04:36.505
TEAM THAT'S ADDRESSING THOSE

01:04:36.572 --> 01:04:38.040
ISSUES AND THE INTEREST OF TIME.

01:04:38.107 --> 01:04:39.442
I WILL SIMPLY LIST SOME OF THE

01:04:39.508 --> 01:04:41.644
MANY PROBLEMS WITH THIS BILL, AS

01:04:41.711 --> 01:04:43.312
AMENDED. WE APPRECIATE INCLUDING

01:04:43.379 --> 01:04:45.715
THE CPUC PROCESS IN THIS BILL.

01:04:45.781 --> 01:04:47.350
HOWEVER, THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT

01:04:47.416 --> 01:04:48.517
TO HOLD PUBLIC HEARINGS BEFORE

01:04:48.584 --> 01:04:50.419
THE MANDATED DATE OF DECEMBER

01:04:50.486 --> 01:04:53.356
15TH, 2026. SECOND LIFELINE IS A

01:04:53.422 --> 01:04:55.725
SUBSIDY PROGRAM FOR LOW INCOME

01:04:55.791 --> 01:04:57.093
CUSTOMERS. THE DEFINITION OF

01:04:57.159 --> 01:04:59.195
WELL SERVED ONLY REQUIRES ONE

01:04:59.262 --> 01:05:00.763
LIFELINE OPTION, WHICH COULD

01:05:00.830 --> 01:05:02.365
RESULT IN THE LOSS OF THE

01:05:02.431 --> 01:05:04.166
SUBSIDY FEE FOR SOME CUSTOMERS,

01:05:04.233 --> 01:05:06.002
AND BROADBAND DOES NOT CURRENTLY

01:05:06.068 --> 01:05:08.571
HAVE A LIFELINE SUBSIDY. THE

01:05:08.638 --> 01:05:11.040
CPUC IS REQUIRED TO ADOPT MAPS,

01:05:11.107 --> 01:05:12.875
BUT IT IS ALSO REQUIRED TO

01:05:12.942 --> 01:05:14.176
INCLUDE DATA FROM THE VERY

01:05:14.243 --> 01:05:15.945
FAULTY MAPS THAT DEAL WITH

01:05:16.012 --> 01:05:17.713
BROADBAND AND WIRELESS COVERAGE.

01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:19.315
MOST IMPORTANTLY, THERE IS NO

01:05:19.382 --> 01:05:21.550
REQUIREMENT FOR ON THE GROUND

01:05:21.617 --> 01:05:22.952
CERTIFICATION THAT A WIRELESS

01:05:23.019 --> 01:05:25.254
COVERAGE ACTUALLY EXISTS. THIS

01:05:25.321 --> 01:05:27.456
MANDATE IS IN THE OREGON

01:05:27.523 --> 01:05:29.892
REQUIREMENTS, BUT NOT IN AB 470.

01:05:29.959 --> 01:05:31.260
THERE ARE MAJOR CONCERNS THAT

01:05:31.327 --> 01:05:33.529
THE SERVICES REPORTED IN THESE

01:05:33.596 --> 01:05:35.364
MAPS DO NOT PROVIDE CUSTOMERS

01:05:35.431 --> 01:05:38.501
WITH ACCURATE 911 CALLING. THE

01:05:38.567 --> 01:05:40.436
INDIVIDUAL CHALLENGE PROCESS

01:05:40.503 --> 01:05:42.471
COMES AFTER THE CPUC ADOPTS

01:05:42.538 --> 01:05:44.373
RULES AND MAPS, WHICH MEANS THAT

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.075
CUSTOMERS HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A

01:05:46.142 --> 01:05:47.176
WAY TO FIGHT THE TELEPHONE

01:05:47.243 --> 01:05:49.278
COMPANY ON THEIR OWN, AND WHO

01:05:49.345 --> 01:05:51.314
HAS THE RESOURCES TO DO THAT.

01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:54.116
WHILE THERE IS A CPUC PROCESS TO

01:05:54.183 --> 01:05:55.718
DEVELOP RULES, THE BILL DOESN'T

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:58.287
REQUIRE A CPUC HEARING TO REVIEW

01:05:58.354 --> 01:06:00.523
APPLICATIONS OR TO TERMINATE THE

01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:02.158
OBLIGATION. INSTEAD, THAT'S

01:06:02.224 --> 01:06:03.793
ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH A NON

01:06:03.859 --> 01:06:04.894
EVIDENTIARY ADVICE LETTER THAT

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:07.163
IS SUBMITTED TO STAFF, NOT THE

01:06:07.229 --> 01:06:08.831
COMMISSION OR TO AN

01:06:08.898 --> 01:06:10.099
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE. THE

01:06:10.166 --> 01:06:11.500
BILL NEEDS MORE STAKEHOLDER

01:06:11.567 --> 01:06:13.336
INPUT AND IT NEEDS A LOT MORE

01:06:13.402 --> 01:06:15.604
TIME. I DON'T THINK YOUR

01:06:15.671 --> 01:06:16.572
CONSTITUENTS ARE CALLING FOR THE

01:06:16.639 --> 01:06:19.041
END OF COACHELLA, SO WE DON'T

01:06:19.108 --> 01:06:20.176
UNDERSTAND THE URGENCY. THANK

01:06:20.242 --> 01:06:22.812
YOU, THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS

01:06:22.878 --> 01:06:24.613
PLEASE. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR.

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:25.981
MEMBERS IGNACIO HERNANDEZ, ON

01:06:26.048 --> 01:06:27.283
BEHALF OF THE COMMUNICATION

01:06:27.350 --> 01:06:28.417
WORKERS OF AMERICA, DISTRICT

01:06:28.484 --> 01:06:30.319
NINE, WHICH IS THE HEADQUARTERS

01:06:30.386 --> 01:06:31.754
FOR CALIFORNIA, NEVADA AND

01:06:31.821 --> 01:06:32.621
HAWAII. WE ARE STRONGLY OPPOSED

01:06:32.688 --> 01:06:35.925
TO THE BILL. KOHLER IS, AMONG

01:06:35.991 --> 01:06:37.893
OTHER THINGS, A MANDATE FOR

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:39.495
UNIVERSAL SERVICE. IF SOMEONE

01:06:39.562 --> 01:06:40.863
REQUESTS HOME PHONE SERVICE,

01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:42.465
THEY GET IT. THAT MEANS NOT ONLY

01:06:42.531 --> 01:06:44.500
IS THEIR SERVICE, BUT THERE IS

01:06:44.567 --> 01:06:46.168
AN OBLIGATION TO REPAIR. THERE'S

01:06:46.235 --> 01:06:47.970
AN OBLIGATION TO KEEP UP THE

01:06:48.037 --> 01:06:50.940
INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THAT ALSO

01:06:51.006 --> 01:06:51.807
MEANS THAT CUSTOMERS ARE

01:06:51.874 --> 01:06:52.975
CONNECTED, BUT ALSO MEANS

01:06:53.042 --> 01:06:54.944
WORKERS HAVE JOBS. WE HAVE SEEN

01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:56.345
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, MORE

01:06:56.412 --> 01:06:58.180
AND MORE OF OUR WORKERS LOSE

01:06:58.247 --> 01:07:00.149
THEIR JOBS. AND IF THERE'S A

01:07:00.216 --> 01:07:01.751
CONTINUED SHRINKING OF THE

01:07:01.817 --> 01:07:03.652
FOOTPRINT IN CALIFORNIA, WE'RE

01:07:03.719 --> 01:07:05.187
JUST GOING TO LOSE MORE AND MORE

01:07:05.254 --> 01:07:07.022
JOBS. THE WAY THIS BILL IS

01:07:07.089 --> 01:07:09.158
DRAFTED, THERE'S LITTLE, IF ANY,

01:07:09.225 --> 01:07:11.327
PROTECTIONS AND GUARANTEES FOR

01:07:11.394 --> 01:07:13.229
THE WORKFORCE TO NOT ONLY STAY

01:07:13.295 --> 01:07:15.731
AT ITS CURRENT LEVEL, BUT TO

01:07:15.798 --> 01:07:18.601
INCREASE. WE DO APPRECIATE THE

01:07:18.667 --> 01:07:19.602
LANGUAGE IN THERE ABOUT A BUILD

01:07:19.668 --> 01:07:21.771
OUT. BUT LET'S BE CLEAR NOTHING

01:07:21.837 --> 01:07:23.572
IN THE BILL REQUIRES THE BUILD

01:07:23.639 --> 01:07:26.475
OUT TO BE DONE BY UNION WORKERS

01:07:26.542 --> 01:07:28.210
OR WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA.

01:07:28.277 --> 01:07:30.045
THERE'S NO LANGUAGE ABOUT WHO

01:07:30.112 --> 01:07:31.180
WILL DO THE WORK. WHATEVER THE

01:07:31.247 --> 01:07:33.282
PRACTICE HAS BEEN IN THE PAST,

01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:35.751
WE ALL KNOW IF IT'S NOT IN THE

01:07:35.818 --> 01:07:36.952
BILL, THEN THERE'S NO GUARANTEE.

01:07:37.019 --> 01:07:38.754
WE LEARNED OUR LESSON AS CWA

01:07:38.821 --> 01:07:40.489
WHEN THE BILL PASSED ABOUT TEN

01:07:40.556 --> 01:07:42.091
YEARS AGO, ACTUALLY, ABOUT 20

01:07:42.158 --> 01:07:43.559
YEARS AGO NOW, THERE WERE

01:07:43.626 --> 01:07:45.294
PROMISES OF JOBS THAT NEVER

01:07:45.361 --> 01:07:46.529
DELIVERED. SO WE'RE VERY

01:07:46.595 --> 01:07:48.063
CONCERNED THE WAY IT'S

01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:49.532
STRUCTURED. WE'RE VERY CONCERNED

01:07:49.598 --> 01:07:51.600
WITH THE CPUC PROCESS, WHICH

01:07:51.667 --> 01:07:53.469
NEEDS TO BE STRONGER. WE'RE VERY

01:07:53.536 --> 01:07:54.870
CONCERNED THAT IF SOMEBODY WANTS

01:07:54.937 --> 01:07:56.539
TO KEEP THEIR CURRENT LANDLINE,

01:07:56.605 --> 01:07:58.073
THEY ONLY GET TO KEEP IT FOR 12

01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:00.342
MORE MONTHS AND THAT'S IT. SO

01:08:00.409 --> 01:08:03.446
GOING FORWARD, WE HAVE PROVIDED

01:08:03.512 --> 01:08:04.914
THREE PAGES OF ANALYSIS AND

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:06.081
SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS ABOUT A

01:08:06.148 --> 01:08:08.250
MONTH AGO ON THIS BILL. AND WE

01:08:08.317 --> 01:08:09.652
HAVE ALWAYS SAID WE'RE WILLING

01:08:09.718 --> 01:08:11.787
TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS. BUT THIS

01:08:11.854 --> 01:08:14.423
BILL, AS IT'S CURRENTLY IN ITS

01:08:14.490 --> 01:08:15.524
CURRENT FORM, IS NOT WHERE IT

01:08:15.591 --> 01:08:18.160
NEEDS TO BE. WE THINK WE NEED TO

01:08:18.227 --> 01:08:19.128
TAKE A FEW MORE MONTHS TO SIT

01:08:19.195 --> 01:08:20.763
DOWN WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS AND

01:08:20.830 --> 01:08:23.199
NEGOTIATE SOMETHING THAT IS

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:25.100
BETTER FOR EVERYONE. THANK YOU,

01:08:25.167 --> 01:08:27.369

01:15:25.687 --> 01:15:27.556
BILL HAS COME A LONG WAY SINCE

01:15:27.623 --> 01:15:28.957
IT WAS FIRST INTRODUCED. I KNOW

01:15:29.024 --> 01:15:31.793
IT'S GONE THROUGH SEVERAL

01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:33.896
ITERATIONS TO TRY AND REALLY

01:15:33.962 --> 01:15:37.032
BRING TOGETHER THE VOICES AND

01:15:37.099 --> 01:15:40.335
CONCERNS FROM A LOT OF DIFFERENT

01:15:40.402 --> 01:15:44.673
AREAS AND REALLY APPRECIATE THE

PATIENCE FROM ALL OF THE

01:15:46.575 --> 01:15:48.043
STAKEHOLDERS AND TRYING TO GET

01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:50.078
THIS RIGHT. I APPRECIATE I WAS

01:15:50.145 --> 01:15:52.581
READING OVER A LOT OF AMENDMENTS

01:15:52.648 --> 01:15:54.950
THAT WERE TAKEN OVER LAST NIGHT

01:15:55.017 --> 01:15:57.252
AND THIS MORNING, AND IT REALLY

01:15:57.319 --> 01:16:00.289
IS VERY EVIDENT HOW MUCH EFFORT

01:16:00.355 --> 01:16:03.558
THAT YOU'VE PUT IN AND HOW MUCH

01:16:03.625 --> 01:16:06.295
CONCERN AND CARE THAT YOU HAVE

01:16:06.361 --> 01:16:08.163
FOR TRYING TO GET THIS RIGHT.

01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:09.431

LISTENING AND CONTINUE TO LISTEN

01:16:11.099 --> 01:16:14.269
TO THE VOICES OF LABOR AND, AND

01:16:14.336 --> 01:16:16.772
ANYONE ELSE WHO'S WILLING TO

01:16:16.838 --> 01:16:19.274
COME TO THE, TO THE TABLE TO

01:16:19.341 --> 01:16:21.043
ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. AND SO,

01:16:21.109 --> 01:16:22.978
YOU KNOW, I WOULD LIKE TO, TO

01:16:23.045 --> 01:16:25.447
MOVE THE BILL AND WOULD LOVE TO

01:16:25.514 --> 01:16:27.916
HEAR FROM MY OTHER COLLEAGUES.

01:16:27.983 --> 01:16:30.886
BUT AS IS WITH THE PREVIOUS

01:16:30.953 --> 01:16:32.554
ITERATION, I WILL BE SUPPORTING

01:16:32.621 --> 01:16:35.524
THIS. WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THE

01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:39.695
BILL. A SECOND ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

01:16:39.761 --> 01:16:43.098
ROGERS, THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND

01:16:43.165 --> 01:16:44.800
UNLIKE MY COLLEAGUE, I DIDN'T

01:16:44.866 --> 01:16:46.301
SUPPORT THE PREVIOUS ITERATION

01:16:46.368 --> 01:16:48.170
OF THE BILL, AND AT THE TIME, WE

01:16:48.236 --> 01:16:51.707
TALKED A LOT ABOUT MY DISTRICT

01:16:51.773 --> 01:16:53.608
FROM SONOMA COUNTY UP TO OREGON,

01:16:53.675 --> 01:16:55.410
THE CONCERNS THAT FOLKS HAVE.

01:16:55.477 --> 01:16:56.745
AND I REALLY WANT TO PUNCTUATE

01:16:56.812 --> 01:16:58.213
THE POINT THAT THAT MY COLLEAGUE

01:16:58.280 --> 01:16:59.414
MADE ABOUT ALL OF THE EFFORT

01:16:59.481 --> 01:17:02.417
THAT YOU'VE MADE. THE AUTHOR DID

01:17:02.484 --> 01:17:04.152
A ZOOM MEETING WITH SUPERVISORS

01:17:04.219 --> 01:17:05.821
FROM MY DISTRICT TO TALK ABOUT

01:17:05.887 --> 01:17:08.390
THEIR SPECIFIC CONCERNS, EVEN

01:17:08.457 --> 01:17:09.758
KNOWING THAT THEY WERE UNLIKELY

01:17:09.825 --> 01:17:10.759
TO REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION AT

01:17:10.826 --> 01:17:12.394
THE TIME, BUT JUST THOUGHT THAT

01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:14.196
IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO TO

01:17:14.262 --> 01:17:16.064
HEAR THOSE VOICES. AND I THINK

01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:17.332
THAT THE BILL HAS COME A LONG

01:17:17.399 --> 01:17:19.334
WAY. I DO HEAR THE CONCERNS FROM

01:17:19.401 --> 01:17:21.069
CWA STILL, AND I HOPE YOU'LL

01:17:21.136 --> 01:17:22.471
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM ON

01:17:22.537 --> 01:17:23.438
THAT, PARTICULARLY THINGS THAT

01:17:23.505 --> 01:17:24.539
HAVE WORKED IN OTHER STATES TO

01:17:24.606 --> 01:17:26.808
TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE

01:17:26.875 --> 01:17:27.709
CONCERNS. BUT I'VE GOT TO BE

01:17:27.776 --> 01:17:29.277
HONEST, I DON'T KNOW THAT I'VE

01:17:29.344 --> 01:17:30.712
SEEN ANY OTHER BILL THIS YEAR

01:17:30.779 --> 01:17:32.614
THAT HAS HAD AN AUTHOR THAT'S

01:17:32.681 --> 01:17:33.749
JUMPED THROUGH SO MANY HOOPS

01:17:33.815 --> 01:17:36.051
TRYING TO MAKE IT WORK, AND I

01:17:36.118 --> 01:17:36.985
PARTICULARLY APPRECIATE THAT

01:17:37.052 --> 01:17:38.920
EVEN EVEN JUST AS RECENTLY AS A

01:17:38.987 --> 01:17:40.188
COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, I CAME TO

01:17:40.255 --> 01:17:42.424
YOU AND I SAID, WELL, I THINK

01:17:42.491 --> 01:17:43.458
THAT THERE'S A DRAFTING ERROR.

01:17:43.525 --> 01:17:45.327
HE SAID, DON'T WORRY, WE'LL FIX

01:17:45.394 --> 01:17:46.528
IT. AND YOU DID. AND SO I'M

01:17:46.595 --> 01:17:48.330
HAPPY TO SUPPORT TO LET IT OUT

01:17:48.397 --> 01:17:50.298
OF THE COMMITTEE TODAY. I KNOW

01:17:50.365 --> 01:17:51.533
YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.168
AND TO CONTINUE TO HEAR THOSE

01:17:53.235 --> 01:17:54.770
VOICES, BUT I JUST SINCERELY

01:17:54.836 --> 01:17:56.471
WANT TO THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE

01:17:56.538 --> 01:17:58.940
TIME TO GET TO KNOW MY DISTRICT

01:17:59.007 --> 01:17:59.908
AND THE WAY THAT IT WOULD IMPACT

01:17:59.975 --> 01:18:00.942
MY DISTRICT, AND TO ADDRESS

01:18:01.009 --> 01:18:02.577
THOSE CONCERNS. THANK YOU. I DO,

01:18:02.644 --> 01:18:06.448
AND I DO PLAN ON WORKING WITH

01:18:06.515 --> 01:18:09.451
CWA IN THE FUTURE WITH THIS

01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:11.286
BILL. I WANT TO CONTINUE TO

01:18:11.353 --> 01:18:12.854
WORK. I HEAR THEM, I HEAR YOU

01:18:12.921 --> 01:18:14.556
WHEN YOU'RE SAYING THAT THAT YOU

01:18:14.623 --> 01:18:16.425
DON'T SEE A GUARANTEE IN THE

01:18:16.491 --> 01:18:18.026
BILL. SO I DO HEAR YOU AND

01:18:18.093 --> 01:18:19.594
RECEIVE THAT, AND I AM WILLING

01:18:19.661 --> 01:18:21.496
TO GO BACK AND WORK ON THAT,

01:18:21.563 --> 01:18:23.932
BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:18:23.999 --> 01:18:25.033
THE WORKERS ARE WORKING. WE HAVE

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:27.069
NOW A 3 TO 1 BUILD OUT, WHICH IS

01:18:27.135 --> 01:18:30.305
A LOT OF FIBER WORK. AND SO WE

01:18:30.372 --> 01:18:33.275
WANT THAT TO BE UNION WORKERS.

01:18:33.341 --> 01:18:36.211
AND SO I AM DEFINITELY WILLING

01:18:36.278 --> 01:18:40.715
TO WORK WITH CWA ON THAT.

01:18:40.782 --> 01:18:42.851
ASSEMBLYMEMBER RUBIO, THANK YOU.

01:18:42.918 --> 01:18:44.219
ASSEMBLYMEMBER MCKINLEY. I KNOW

01:18:44.286 --> 01:18:46.588
HOW HARD THIS HAS BEEN AND HOW

01:18:46.655 --> 01:18:48.023
MUCH WORK YOU'VE PUT INTO IT.

01:18:48.090 --> 01:18:50.859
AND I DO HEAR THE CWA WORKERS,

01:18:50.926 --> 01:18:53.261
BUT I KNOW THAT SOMETIMES JUST

01:18:53.328 --> 01:18:54.763
OPPOSING A BILL BECAUSE YOU

01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:57.265
OPPOSE IT DOESN'T HELP IN, YOU

01:18:57.332 --> 01:18:58.834
KNOW, ACTUALLY PRESENTING THINGS

01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:00.302
THAT NEED TO BE FIXED. SO THAT'S

01:19:00.368 --> 01:19:02.571
WHY I HAVE FULL CONFIDENCE. I

01:19:02.637 --> 01:19:03.238
KNOW YOU WERE WORKING ON IT LAST

01:19:03.305 --> 01:19:05.407
NIGHT AND THIS MORNING, AND I DO

01:19:05.474 --> 01:19:07.676
HAVE THE CONFIDENCE THAT YOU

01:19:07.742 --> 01:19:08.443
WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH CWA

01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:09.778
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR CONCERNS

01:19:09.845 --> 01:19:12.013
ARE HEARD. AND SO REALLY

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:14.282
APPRECIATE ALL OF THE WORK THAT

01:19:14.349 --> 01:19:14.950
YOU'VE DONE. AND, ASSEMBLYMEMBER

01:19:15.016 --> 01:19:16.418
ROGERS, I HAVE SEEN OTHER FOLKS

01:19:16.485 --> 01:19:19.621
THAT HAVE WORKED ON BILLS REALLY

01:19:19.688 --> 01:19:21.389
HARD. SO YOU KNOW VERY WELL HOW

01:19:21.456 --> 01:19:24.392
HARD IT IS TO TRY AND BRING ALL

01:19:24.459 --> 01:19:25.727
SIDES TOGETHER. SO I REALLY DO

01:19:25.794 --> 01:19:28.530
APPRECIATE IT. AND I AGAIN, I DO

01:19:28.597 --> 01:19:29.598
ENCOURAGE AND I KNOW IT'S GOING

01:19:29.664 --> 01:19:31.900
TO THE SENATE NOW TO YOU KNOW,

01:19:31.967 --> 01:19:34.402
THEY'LL BE FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS

01:19:34.469 --> 01:19:36.071
AND COMPROMISES. SO I REALLY

01:19:36.138 --> 01:19:37.873
APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU. AND

01:19:37.939 --> 01:19:40.909
I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:19:40.976 --> 01:19:42.744
UNDERSTAND THAT THIS AGAIN IS

01:19:42.811 --> 01:19:45.247
NOT A BROADBAND BILL. THIS IS A

01:19:45.313 --> 01:19:46.548
TELECOMMUNICATION BILL. I JUST

01:19:46.615 --> 01:19:47.349
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE I'M

01:19:47.415 --> 01:19:49.618
GOING TO SAY THAT AGAIN THIS IS

01:19:49.684 --> 01:19:51.953
IT'S NOT A BROADBAND BILL. THANK

01:19:52.020 --> 01:19:54.823
YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER BONTA, I

01:19:54.890 --> 01:19:56.124
WANT TO OF COURSE, APPRECIATE

01:19:56.191 --> 01:19:58.093
THE AUTHOR FOR CONTINUING TO

01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:00.996
WORK ON THIS BILL. AS YOU ALL

01:20:01.062 --> 01:20:02.430
WILL REMEMBER WHEN WE FIRST

01:20:02.497 --> 01:20:06.368
HEARD THIS BILL, I WAS NOT I

01:20:06.434 --> 01:20:08.770
VOTED FOR IT ON THE CONDITION

01:20:08.837 --> 01:20:10.071
THAT THERE WOULD BE CONTINUED

01:20:10.138 --> 01:20:12.140
WORK ON THIS. I HAD SEVERAL

01:20:12.207 --> 01:20:13.675
AREAS OF CONCERN, SOME OF WHICH

01:20:13.742 --> 01:20:15.410
HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED BY THE

01:20:15.477 --> 01:20:16.478
AMENDMENTS, SOME THAT ARE KIND

01:20:16.545 --> 01:20:18.747
OF STILL OUTSTANDING. SO I JUST

01:20:18.813 --> 01:20:20.382
WANTED TO ASK, WHILE WE ARE IN

01:20:20.448 --> 01:20:22.083
POLICY CONVERSATION AROUND SOME

01:20:22.150 --> 01:20:24.452
OF THOSE AREAS OF CONCERN, I'LL

01:20:24.519 --> 01:20:27.422
START IF IT'S OKAY WITH THE WITH

01:20:27.489 --> 01:20:31.393
THE ISSUE OF THE CW, THE SOURCE

01:20:31.459 --> 01:20:36.464
OF CW PRIMARY CONCERNS, WHICH I

01:20:36.531 --> 01:20:38.366
THINK, YOU KNOW, THERE'S A

01:20:38.433 --> 01:20:40.869
PATHWAY TO POTENTIAL RELIEF

01:20:40.936 --> 01:20:42.070
AROUND THAT, WHICH HAS TO DO

01:20:42.137 --> 01:20:43.872
WITH THE BUILD OUT AND

01:20:43.939 --> 01:20:45.640
UNDERSTANDING THAT. SO JUST

01:20:45.707 --> 01:20:46.741
CAPTURING THE COMMENT THAT WAS

01:20:46.808 --> 01:20:50.011
MADE BY THE OPPOSITION AROUND

01:20:50.078 --> 01:20:51.646
WHETHER THERE IS AN ABILITY TO

01:20:51.713 --> 01:20:55.850
BE ABLE TO, IN STATUTE, BE VERY

01:20:55.917 --> 01:20:57.152
SPECIFIC ABOUT THE WAYS IN WHICH

01:20:57.219 --> 01:20:59.287
THERE WOULD EITHER BE A JUST

01:20:59.354 --> 01:21:01.790
TRANSITION FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:21:01.856 --> 01:21:05.227
CURRENTLY EMPLOYED BY AT&amp;T, CWA

01:21:05.293 --> 01:21:09.130
MEMBERS, AND TO WHAT EXTENT

01:21:09.197 --> 01:21:11.600
THERE IS AN ABILITY TO ACTUALLY

01:21:11.666 --> 01:21:14.169
HAVE CWA MEMBERS PARTICIPATE IN

01:21:14.236 --> 01:21:16.571
THE BUILD OUT. SO I WANT TO ASK

01:21:16.638 --> 01:21:18.106
THAT QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR, BUT

01:21:18.173 --> 01:21:19.808
THEN ALSO GIVE OPPOSITION AN

01:21:19.874 --> 01:21:21.710
OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO

01:21:21.776 --> 01:21:25.513
WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS A PATH

01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:27.882
FOR CWA MEMBERS TO BE TO BE ABLE

01:21:27.949 --> 01:21:29.484
TO PARTICIPATE IN THE BUILD OUT.

01:21:29.551 --> 01:21:33.622
YES. AT&amp;T IS THE ONLY

01:21:33.688 --> 01:21:34.956
TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY THAT

01:21:35.023 --> 01:21:37.392
HAS LABOR. THAT'S LABOR. AM I

01:21:37.459 --> 01:21:39.628
CORRECT ON THAT? THAT'S UNION.

01:21:39.694 --> 01:21:42.130
AND SO I IN THEIR IN THEIR

01:21:42.197 --> 01:21:43.632
CONTRACT. I DON'T THINK THAT

01:21:43.698 --> 01:21:45.500
THEIR CONTRACT WAS LIKE THEY HAD

01:21:45.567 --> 01:21:47.569
TO BE BUILT IN KOLAR. BUT I AM

01:21:47.636 --> 01:21:49.571
WILLING TO GO IN AND, AND LOOK

01:21:49.638 --> 01:21:51.640
AT THAT AND AMEND THE BILL TO

01:21:51.706 --> 01:21:53.341
MAKE SURE THAT THEY, THAT

01:21:53.408 --> 01:21:54.976
THEY'RE IN THE BILL, THAT

01:21:55.043 --> 01:21:56.511
THEY'RE DOING THE WORK AND

01:21:56.578 --> 01:21:58.246
THEY'RE IN THE BILL. AND SO I AM

01:21:58.313 --> 01:22:00.215
WILLING TO SIT DOWN WITH THEM

01:22:00.282 --> 01:22:01.783
AND GET LANGUAGE DÃ° LANGUAGE ON

01:22:01.850 --> 01:22:03.418
THAT. NO PROBLEM. I'VE ALREADY

01:22:03.485 --> 01:22:04.452
STARTED LOOKING AT LANGUAGE

01:22:04.519 --> 01:22:05.754
ALREADY BEFORE I EVEN HAD A

01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:08.390
CHANCE FOR US TO MEET AGAIN. I

01:22:08.456 --> 01:22:10.325
ON LAST WEEK WEEKEND I WAS OUR

01:22:10.392 --> 01:22:12.427
LAST FRIDAY. I WAS LOOKING AT

01:22:12.494 --> 01:22:14.329
LANGUAGE TO PUT IN AROUND THIS

01:22:14.396 --> 01:22:16.131
BECAUSE I NEVER THOUGHT THAT

01:22:16.197 --> 01:22:17.332
THEY WEREN'T GOING TO DO THE

01:22:17.399 --> 01:22:19.267
WORK, AND AT&amp;T NEVER SAID THAT

01:22:19.334 --> 01:22:21.169
THEY WERE NOT GOING TO DO THE

01:22:21.236 --> 01:22:23.271
WORK. AND SO THEY ALREADY HAVE A

01:22:23.338 --> 01:22:24.239
FOUR YEAR CONTRACT. THEY JUST

01:22:24.306 --> 01:22:25.807
SIGNED THEIR CONTRACT WITH AT&amp;T.

01:22:25.874 --> 01:22:27.475
AND SO I DON'T THINK IN THE

01:22:27.542 --> 01:22:29.044
CONTRACT IT SAYS KOEHLER, I

01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:30.178
DON'T I'M NOT SURE BECAUSE I

01:22:30.245 --> 01:22:31.579
HAVEN'T SEEN THEIR CONTRACT. SO

01:22:31.646 --> 01:22:34.416
I WASN'T I ASSUMED THAT THEY

01:22:34.482 --> 01:22:36.618
WOULD JUST TRANSACTION. SO SINCE

01:22:36.685 --> 01:22:38.386
SINCE I WOULD MAKE SURE THAT I

01:22:38.453 --> 01:22:39.421
WORK WITH THEM TO GO FORWARD SO

01:22:39.487 --> 01:22:41.356
THAT THEY CAN BE COMFORTABLE

01:22:41.423 --> 01:22:42.824
WITH THE LANGUAGE, I'LL SEND THE

01:22:42.891 --> 01:22:46.928
LANGUAGE TO THEM. YEAH. IF I

01:22:46.995 --> 01:22:49.497
MAY, MADAM CHAIR. SORRY. YES,

01:22:49.564 --> 01:22:51.733
PLEASE. PLEASE RESPOND. YEAH. SO

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:53.835
A FEW THINGS IN RESPONSE. JUST

01:22:53.902 --> 01:22:56.037
TO CLARIFY OUR POSITION. ONE IS

01:22:56.104 --> 01:22:57.772
OF COURSE AROUND THE BUILD OUT,

01:22:57.839 --> 01:23:00.141
WHICH IN OUR THREE PAGE DOCUMENT

01:23:00.208 --> 01:23:01.343
THAT WE SUBMITTED A MONTH AGO,

01:23:01.409 --> 01:23:02.844
THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS

01:23:02.911 --> 01:23:04.946
INCLUDED IN THERE ON THE BUILD

01:23:05.013 --> 01:23:06.214
OUT, AND ALSO MAKING SURE THAT

01:23:06.281 --> 01:23:07.215
THE BUILD OUT IS ACTUALLY ABOVE

01:23:07.282 --> 01:23:09.050
BUILD OUT. THAT IS ALREADY

01:23:09.117 --> 01:23:09.884
PLANNED BECAUSE OTHERWISE

01:23:09.951 --> 01:23:11.319
THERE'S NO ADDED VALUE. WE

01:23:11.386 --> 01:23:12.554
UNDERSTAND THE COMPANY IS

01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:13.621
ALREADY PLANNING TO DO SOME

01:23:13.688 --> 01:23:15.557
BUILD OUT, SO IF IT'S JUST GOING

01:23:15.623 --> 01:23:16.458
TO MIRROR THAT, THEN THERE'S

01:23:16.524 --> 01:23:18.993
REALLY NO GAIN. THE SECOND THING

01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:21.563
THAT WE PUT IN THERE WAS ABOUT

01:23:21.629 --> 01:23:23.298
THE REQUIREMENT GOING FORWARD.

01:23:23.365 --> 01:23:25.166
THE BILL AS WE READ IT,

01:23:25.233 --> 01:23:28.069
POTENTIALLY PROHIBITS ANY

01:23:28.136 --> 01:23:30.238
ALTERNATIVE PROVIDER COMING IN

01:23:30.305 --> 01:23:31.639
FOR BEING FROM ASSUMING ANY OF

01:23:31.706 --> 01:23:33.108
THE REQUIREMENTS, MEANING THAT

01:23:33.174 --> 01:23:34.509
THEY WOULD NOT HAVE A MANDATE TO

01:23:34.576 --> 01:23:36.244
SERVE EVERYBODY. THAT'S

01:23:36.311 --> 01:23:37.212
CONCERNING FOR US, BECAUSE WHAT

01:23:37.278 --> 01:23:39.414
WE HAVE SEEN IN THE BROADBAND,

01:23:39.481 --> 01:23:40.515
AND IT'S NOT A BROADBAND BILL,

01:23:40.582 --> 01:23:42.117
BUT WE'VE SEEN WHAT HAS HAPPENED

01:23:42.183 --> 01:23:43.818
IN BROADBAND, IS THAT COMPANIES

01:23:43.885 --> 01:23:44.552
PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH

01:23:44.619 --> 01:23:45.620
COMMUNITIES TO SERVE. AND THAT'S

01:23:45.687 --> 01:23:46.721
CONCERNING FOR US BECAUSE FEWER

01:23:46.788 --> 01:23:48.156
CONNECTIONS, FEWER PEOPLE BEING

01:23:48.223 --> 01:23:50.291
SERVED IS BAD. AND THAT ALSO

01:23:50.358 --> 01:23:51.826
MEANS FEWER JOBS FOR FOLKS. SO

01:23:51.893 --> 01:23:53.294
HAVING SOMETHING IN THERE TO

01:23:53.361 --> 01:23:55.063
GUARANTEE THAT THAT WILL THAT

01:23:55.130 --> 01:23:57.499
THERE'LL BE SOME MANDATE FOR

01:23:57.565 --> 01:23:58.600
SERVICE, BECAUSE THAT MEANS

01:23:58.666 --> 01:24:00.402
MANDATED REPAIR, MANDATED

01:24:00.468 --> 01:24:02.203
MAINTENANCE OF THE

01:24:02.270 --> 01:24:04.406
INFRASTRUCTURE GOING FORWARD.

01:24:04.472 --> 01:24:06.207
THE OTHER THING IS, AS FAR AS

01:24:06.274 --> 01:24:07.475
CWA, LAST ONE I'LL MENTION AND

01:24:07.542 --> 01:24:09.077
THEN I'LL ANSWER ANY OTHER

01:24:09.144 --> 01:24:13.014
QUESTIONS, IS THERE ALSO NEEDS

01:24:13.081 --> 01:24:14.883
TO BE A REVIEW OF THE

01:24:14.949 --> 01:24:16.918
ALTERNATIVE PROVIDERS? THE

01:24:16.985 --> 01:24:17.852
DEFINITION OF WELL SERVE SAYS

01:24:17.919 --> 01:24:19.354
THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE 2 OR 3

01:24:19.421 --> 01:24:21.456
BOXES THAT NEED TO BE CHECKED,

01:24:21.523 --> 01:24:23.625
BUT THERE'S NO LANGUAGE IN THERE

01:24:23.691 --> 01:24:25.160
THAT DOES ANY ASSESSMENT

01:24:25.226 --> 01:24:27.429
ANALYSIS OF WHETHER OR NOT THOSE

01:24:27.495 --> 01:24:29.164
ALTERNATIVE PROVIDERS ARE

01:24:29.230 --> 01:24:31.065
WORKERS, IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE

01:24:31.132 --> 01:24:31.633
USING EMPLOYEES, IF THEY'RE

01:24:31.699 --> 01:24:33.201
GOING TO BE USING UNION WORKERS,

01:24:33.268 --> 01:24:35.370
OR IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE USING

01:24:35.437 --> 01:24:36.404
CONTRACTORS. WE HAVE SEEN A LOT

01:24:36.471 --> 01:24:37.739
OF CONTRACTORS, AND INCREASINGLY

01:24:37.806 --> 01:24:39.607
SO IN THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS

01:24:39.674 --> 01:24:41.109
SPACE THAT IT CONTINUES. AND WE

01:24:41.176 --> 01:24:42.777
ARE VERY, VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

01:24:42.844 --> 01:24:44.446
THAT. AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING

01:24:44.512 --> 01:24:45.713
THAT SHOULD BE LOOKED AT AS

01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:47.215
WELL. SO LIKE WHO ARE THESE

01:24:47.282 --> 01:24:48.283
ALTERNATIVE PROVIDERS? AND JUST

01:24:48.349 --> 01:24:50.752
TO CLARIFY, WE CWA DOES HAVE

01:24:50.819 --> 01:24:52.787
SOME MEMBERS. I CAN'T GIVE YOU

01:24:52.854 --> 01:24:54.055
EXACTLY WHAT THE ROLES ARE, BUT

01:24:54.122 --> 01:24:56.157
WE DO HAVE SOME MEMBERS IN

01:24:56.224 --> 01:24:58.326
VERIZON FRONTIER AND FRONTIER.

01:24:58.393 --> 01:24:59.694
ALL RIGHT. NOW JUST FOR

01:24:59.761 --> 01:25:01.463
CLARIFICATION. BUT YOU KNOW,

01:25:01.529 --> 01:25:03.531
AGAIN, WE NEED TO SEE A LITTLE

01:25:03.598 --> 01:25:05.033
BIT MORE THAN THAT. AND WE'VE

01:25:05.099 --> 01:25:06.434
PROVIDED SOME OF THIS IN OUR

01:25:06.501 --> 01:25:08.870
MEMO FROM A MONTH AGO. AND SO TO

01:25:08.937 --> 01:25:10.405
ANSWER SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS,

01:25:10.472 --> 01:25:12.974
NUMBER ONE, AN UNDERSERVED AREA

01:25:13.041 --> 01:25:15.543
IS SOMEONE THAT HAS AN AREA THAT

01:25:15.610 --> 01:25:18.546
HAS THREE PROVIDERS, TWO OTHER

01:25:18.613 --> 01:25:19.614
WHICH THEY ALREADY THEY HAVE TO

01:25:19.681 --> 01:25:21.349
HAVE THEM NOW. WELL, SIR, WELL

01:25:21.416 --> 01:25:22.517
SERVED I'M SORRY. WELL SERVED.

01:25:22.584 --> 01:25:24.552
THEY HAVE TO HAVE THREE OTHER

01:25:24.619 --> 01:25:25.753
PROVIDERS WHICH THEY HAVE TO

01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:27.388
HAVE IT NOW. NOT LIKE IN THE

01:25:27.455 --> 01:25:29.290
FUTURE. THEY HAVE TO HAVE THREE

01:25:29.357 --> 01:25:32.126
OTHER PROVIDERS, TWO WIRELESS,

01:25:32.193 --> 01:25:34.095
ONE HARD LINE. AND IF I'M NOT

01:25:34.162 --> 01:25:36.130
MISTAKEN, IT CAN'T BE AT&amp;T IS

01:25:36.197 --> 01:25:38.600
THAT CAN'T BE INDEPENDENT

01:25:38.666 --> 01:25:41.469
INFRASTRUCTURE. AND SO THE

01:25:41.536 --> 01:25:42.904
PROVIDERS ARE THERE. AND SO WE

01:25:42.971 --> 01:25:44.339
WOULDN'T BE IT DOESN'T SAY THAT

01:25:44.405 --> 01:25:47.242
WE PROHIBIT THEM FROM HAVING

01:25:47.308 --> 01:25:50.478
UNION LABOR USING A UNION

01:25:50.545 --> 01:25:51.880
WORKERS. THE OTHER PROVIDERS CAN

01:25:51.946 --> 01:25:53.248
DO WHATEVER THEY WANT. THIS BILL

01:25:53.314 --> 01:25:55.550
DOES NOT PROHIBIT ANY COMPANY

01:25:55.617 --> 01:25:57.752
FROM FROM UNIONIZING. BUT WHAT

01:25:57.819 --> 01:26:00.555
WHAT I CAN'T DO IN IN OTHER THAN

01:26:00.622 --> 01:26:02.757
WITH AT&amp;T AND THE BUILD OUT, I

01:26:02.824 --> 01:26:04.692
CANNOT GO IN AND UNIONIZE

01:26:04.759 --> 01:26:06.427
THROUGH MY BILL. AND SO WE WON'T

01:26:06.494 --> 01:26:09.230
I WON'T BE LIKE MAKING LIKE

01:26:09.297 --> 01:26:11.733
SPECTRUM OR T-MOBILE OR ANY

01:26:11.799 --> 01:26:14.202
OTHER TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANY

01:26:14.269 --> 01:26:16.104
UNIONIZED. I THAT'S NOT WHAT

01:26:16.170 --> 01:26:17.872
THIS BILL DOES, BUT IT DOESN'T

01:26:17.939 --> 01:26:20.341
PROHIBIT IT. SO IF, IF, IF THE

01:26:20.408 --> 01:26:21.943
WORKERS WANT TO UNIONIZE IN

01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:23.344
THOSE IN THOSE INDUSTRIES, THEY

01:26:23.411 --> 01:26:25.013
COULD DO THAT. I MEAN, WE DON'T

01:26:25.079 --> 01:26:26.548
PROHIBIT THEM FROM DOING THAT.

01:26:26.614 --> 01:26:28.216
AND SO I WANTED TO MAKE SURE

01:26:28.283 --> 01:26:29.617
THAT WE SAID THAT AND WE'RE NOT

01:26:29.684 --> 01:26:33.321
LEAVING ANY, ANY TELEPHONE, ANY

01:26:33.388 --> 01:26:36.925
CITIZENS WITHOUT TELEPHONE, 99%

01:26:36.991 --> 01:26:39.494
OF FOLKS, 99.9% OF FOLKS WILL

01:26:39.561 --> 01:26:41.696
HAVE A TELEPHONE, BECAUSE WE

01:26:41.763 --> 01:26:43.698
WILL MAKE SURE THAT THE WELL

01:26:43.765 --> 01:26:45.600
SERVED PEOPLE HAVE THE THREE

01:26:45.667 --> 01:26:47.001
OTHER CARRIERS, WHICH THEY

01:26:47.068 --> 01:26:48.469
ALREADY HAVE, AND THEY WON'T

01:26:48.536 --> 01:26:50.338
PULL OUT IF THEY DON'T HAVE

01:26:50.405 --> 01:26:52.006
THIS. AND SO THEY'LL STILL HAVE

01:26:52.073 --> 01:26:53.875
AT&amp;T IF IT'S LIKE IN THE RURAL

01:26:53.942 --> 01:26:55.543
COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY HAVE ONE

01:26:55.610 --> 01:26:57.045
SERVICE PROVIDER, THEY WON'T BE

01:26:57.111 --> 01:26:59.747
PULLING OUT OF OUT OF THOSE

01:26:59.814 --> 01:27:01.916
AREAS. SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE

01:27:01.983 --> 01:27:04.686
SURE THAT WE YOU WANT TO ADD

01:27:04.752 --> 01:27:05.420
ANYTHING, MADAM CHAIR, COULD I

01:27:05.486 --> 01:27:07.655
CLARIFY REAL QUICKLY, JUST VERY

01:27:07.722 --> 01:27:08.990
QUICKLY, I THINK ASSEMBLYMEMBER

01:27:09.057 --> 01:27:11.125
BONTA HAS MORE QUESTIONS. DID

01:27:11.192 --> 01:27:12.927
YOU WANT TO CLARIFY? YEAH. GO

01:27:12.994 --> 01:27:13.861
AHEAD AND CLARIFY. THANK YOU

01:27:13.928 --> 01:27:15.863
MA'AM. JUST CLARIFICATION. WHAT

01:27:15.930 --> 01:27:17.498
I WAS TALKING ABOUT. WHAT'S

01:27:17.565 --> 01:27:20.134
PROHIBITED IS NOT THE USE OF

01:27:20.201 --> 01:27:21.402
UNION WORKERS. JUST TO CLARIFY,

01:27:21.469 --> 01:27:24.739
WE WERE SAYING THAT IMPOSING A

01:27:24.806 --> 01:27:26.507
MANDATED UNIVERSAL SERVICE

01:27:26.574 --> 01:27:28.343
REQUIREMENT ON AN ALTERNATIVE

01:27:28.409 --> 01:27:29.477
PROVIDER IS PROHIBITED BY THE

01:27:29.544 --> 01:27:31.512
BILL OR COULD BE ARGUED TO BE

01:27:31.579 --> 01:27:32.981
PROHIBITED BY THE BILL. AND

01:27:33.047 --> 01:27:33.514
THAT'S CONCERNING FOR US,

01:27:33.581 --> 01:27:35.416
BECAUSE THAT MEANS THAT THE

01:27:35.483 --> 01:27:36.484
OTHER COMPANIES COMING IN,

01:27:36.551 --> 01:27:37.418
WHETHER IT'S THE WIRELESS OR

01:27:37.485 --> 01:27:39.320
WIRELINE, IF THEY DO NOT HAVE A

01:27:39.387 --> 01:27:41.489
MANDATE TO SERVE EVERYONE, THEN

01:27:41.556 --> 01:27:43.358
THEY CAN PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH

01:27:43.424 --> 01:27:44.258
COMMUNITIES TO SERVE. AND THERE

01:27:44.325 --> 01:27:46.561
MAY BE MAYBE 1% OR MAYBE 10%

01:27:46.628 --> 01:27:48.262
THAT THEY CHOOSE NOT TO SERVE.

01:27:48.329 --> 01:27:49.697
THAT'S BAD FOR CONSUMERS AND

01:27:49.764 --> 01:27:51.199
THAT'S BAD FOR THE WORKERS. SO I

01:27:51.265 --> 01:27:53.401
JUST WANT TO CLARIFY WHAT WE

01:27:53.468 --> 01:27:54.569
WERE NOT SAYING MANDATING UNION,

01:27:54.636 --> 01:27:56.304
BUT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:27:56.371 --> 01:27:57.438
THE ALTERNATIVE PROVIDERS PUT UP

01:27:57.505 --> 01:27:59.340
INFORMATION BEFORE WHEN IT'S

01:27:59.407 --> 01:28:01.509
LOOKED AT WHO ARE THEIR WORKERS

01:28:01.576 --> 01:28:02.844
AND WHAT ARE THEY PROVIDING.

01:28:02.910 --> 01:28:04.278
THAT SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT IS

01:28:04.345 --> 01:28:06.180
LOOKED AT. I DON'T THINK THAT'S

01:28:06.247 --> 01:28:07.749
HAPPENING NOW. AND THOSE

01:28:07.815 --> 01:28:09.350
PROVIDERS ARE IN THERE. THEY'RE

01:28:09.417 --> 01:28:11.252
LIKE SPECTRUM'S THERE,

01:28:11.319 --> 01:28:13.087
T-MOBILE'S THERE, VERIZON'S

01:28:13.154 --> 01:28:14.422
THERE. AND THAT IS SOMETHING

01:28:14.489 --> 01:28:15.923
THAT'S NOT HAPPENING AT THIS

01:28:15.990 --> 01:28:17.759
POINT. BUT WE THEY STILL CAN'T

01:28:17.825 --> 01:28:20.328
PULL OUT WITHOUT IF THEY THEY

01:28:20.395 --> 01:28:21.729
CAN'T PULL OUT OF AN AREA THAT

01:28:21.796 --> 01:28:24.198
IS NOT WELL SERVED. IT HAS TO BE

01:28:24.265 --> 01:28:26.734
WELL SERVED. SO NO, EXCUSE ME.

01:28:26.801 --> 01:28:28.136
IF SOMEONE'S PICKING AND

01:28:28.202 --> 01:28:29.937
CHOOSING, AT&amp;T HAS TO STAY

01:28:30.004 --> 01:28:31.406
THERE. IF THEY DON'T HAVE THOSE

01:28:31.472 --> 01:28:33.908
OTHER THREE, THOSE OTHER THREE

01:28:33.975 --> 01:28:36.411
PROVIDERS, AT&amp;T HAS TO STAY IN

01:28:36.477 --> 01:28:38.846
THE COMMUNITY. AND MAYBE AT THIS

01:28:38.913 --> 01:28:40.481
POINT, SORRY, ASSEMBLYMEMBER, I

01:28:40.548 --> 01:28:42.250
WAS JUST GOING TO SAY ON THIS

01:28:42.316 --> 01:28:44.552
POINT, YOU MIGHT WANT TO TALK

01:28:44.619 --> 01:28:45.086
ABOUT MY CRAZY DOOMSDAY

01:28:45.153 --> 01:28:46.688
SCENARIO. AND THEN BECAUSE WE

01:28:46.754 --> 01:28:47.321
THOUGHT ABOUT THIS, YES, THIS.

01:28:47.388 --> 01:28:49.757
AND THEN THERE'S THE. SURE,

01:28:49.824 --> 01:28:52.593
SURE. THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR, AS

01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:54.028
YOU KNOW. WELL, BECAUSE IT WAS

01:28:54.095 --> 01:28:55.530
YOUR DIRECTIVE AND YOUR

01:28:55.596 --> 01:28:57.398
COMMITTEE, THERE IS A PROVISION

01:28:57.465 --> 01:28:59.067
IN THE BILL THAT PROVIDES AN

01:28:59.133 --> 01:29:02.303
ADDITIONAL SAFETY NET EVEN AFTER

01:29:02.370 --> 01:29:03.171
RELINQUISHMENT IN THE STATE AND

01:29:03.237 --> 01:29:04.472
KHÃ RELINQUISHMENT AT THE

01:29:04.539 --> 01:29:07.108
FEDERAL LEVEL FOR TEN YEARS. AND

01:29:07.175 --> 01:29:09.210
SO IN THE EVENT THAT A WELL

01:29:09.277 --> 01:29:11.345
SERVED HOUSEHOLD BECOMES NO

01:29:11.412 --> 01:29:13.748
LONGER WELL SERVED FOR VARIOUS

01:29:13.815 --> 01:29:15.349
REASONS, DOOMSDAY SCENARIOS,

01:29:15.416 --> 01:29:17.118
MAYBE SOME COMPANY GOES BELLY

01:29:17.185 --> 01:29:19.754
UP, AT&amp;T IS ON THE HOOK TO COME

01:29:19.821 --> 01:29:21.389
BACK AND PROVIDE VOICE SERVICES

01:29:21.456 --> 01:29:24.992
FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS,

01:29:25.059 --> 01:29:25.893
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WE HAVE A

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:29.097
COAL OR OBLIGATION.

01:29:29.163 --> 01:29:30.465
ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S MORE QUESTIONS.

01:29:30.531 --> 01:29:33.034
YES. SO I THINK THE OTHER AREA

01:29:33.101 --> 01:29:34.068
OF CONCERN THAT I RAISED, AND

01:29:34.135 --> 01:29:36.204
SEEMS TO STILL NOT BE QUITE

01:29:36.270 --> 01:29:41.609
FULLY ADDRESSED, IS AROUND THE

01:29:41.676 --> 01:29:45.146
ISSUE AROUND MAP, THE MAPPING

01:29:45.213 --> 01:29:46.314
AND THE MAP REQUIREMENTS, THE

01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:49.183
MAP MAKING PROCESS. SO JUST TO

01:29:49.250 --> 01:29:51.619
PICK UP ON THE COMMENT MADE BY

01:29:51.686 --> 01:29:54.522
TURN OPPOSITION, THE

01:29:54.589 --> 01:29:56.324
VERIFICATION PROCESS AROUND

01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:57.859
DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT

01:29:57.925 --> 01:30:00.027
SOMEBODY HAS SERVICE, WHETHER

01:30:00.094 --> 01:30:01.796
THEY ARE UNSERVED OR

01:30:01.863 --> 01:30:02.630
WELL-SERVED, IS SOMETHING THAT

01:30:02.697 --> 01:30:04.298
WE ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH WITHIN

01:30:04.365 --> 01:30:05.733
THE CONTEXT OF BROADBAND. IT WAS

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:08.603
A POINT OF GREAT CONSTERNATION

01:30:08.669 --> 01:30:12.573
WHEN ESSENTIALLY THE ISP

01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:15.843
PROVIDERS WERE ALLOWED TO

01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:16.811
SELF-CERTIFY ESSENTIALLY, THAT

01:30:16.878 --> 01:30:19.747
AN AREA WOULD BE WOULD BE

01:30:19.814 --> 01:30:22.817
SERVED. IT SEEMS LIKE THIS BILL

01:30:22.884 --> 01:30:25.853
ESSENTIALLY MIRRORS THAT, THAT

01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:27.955
PRACTICE. RIGHT. SO I WANTED TO

01:30:28.022 --> 01:30:31.292
JUST AROUND THE MAPMAKING

01:30:31.359 --> 01:30:32.860
PROCESS, WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK

01:30:32.927 --> 01:30:35.997
LIKE? AND IS THERE AN

01:30:36.063 --> 01:30:38.065
OPPORTUNITY TO BRING IN THE

01:30:38.132 --> 01:30:40.268
PIECE THAT WAS MENTIONED, WHICH

01:30:40.334 --> 01:30:41.636
IS ENSURING THAT THERE IS AN ON

01:30:41.702 --> 01:30:44.605
THE GROUND CERTIFICATION THAT

01:30:44.672 --> 01:30:45.640
VALIDATES THAT MAP MAKING

01:30:45.706 --> 01:30:48.576
PROCESS SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE

01:30:48.643 --> 01:30:50.978
THAT DEFINITION OF WELL SERVED

01:30:51.045 --> 01:30:53.114
OR UNSERVED, BASICALLY BEING

01:30:53.181 --> 01:30:55.616
SELF-REPORTED BY THE CARRIER OF

01:30:55.683 --> 01:30:58.319
LAST RESORT, WHO IS SEEKING TO

01:30:58.386 --> 01:31:00.421
GET OUT OF THAT RESPONSIBILITY?

01:31:00.488 --> 01:31:02.990
WELL, SURE. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

01:31:03.057 --> 01:31:04.725
MEMBER. WITH THE NEW AMENDMENTS

01:31:04.792 --> 01:31:07.995
IN THE BILL, THE PUC HAS TAKEN

01:31:08.062 --> 01:31:09.831
COMPLETE AUTHORITY OVER THE

01:31:09.897 --> 01:31:11.566
CHALLENGE AND MAPPING PROCESS.

01:31:11.632 --> 01:31:13.601
SO THEY HAVE UNTIL DECEMBER 16TH

01:31:13.668 --> 01:31:17.371
OF 2026 UPON BILL ENACTMENT, TO

01:31:17.438 --> 01:31:18.739
ESTABLISH THEIR OWN WELL SERVED

01:31:18.806 --> 01:31:21.742
MAP FOR RELINQUISHMENT. THEY MAY

01:31:21.809 --> 01:31:24.512
USE FCC DATA, CPUC DATA,

01:31:24.579 --> 01:31:26.080
EXISTING BE DATA THAT'S ALREADY

01:31:26.147 --> 01:31:28.816
BEEN APPROVED BY THE CPUC,

01:31:28.883 --> 01:31:30.151
ESSENTIALLY THE MOST UP TO DATE

01:31:30.218 --> 01:31:32.854
AND AVAILABLE DATA THAT EXISTS,

01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:34.288
WHICH HAS ALSO BEEN THROUGH ITS

01:31:34.355 --> 01:31:35.289
OWN SERIES OF CHALLENGE

01:31:35.356 --> 01:31:36.524
PROCESSES, BOTH AT THE FEDERAL

01:31:36.591 --> 01:31:38.292
AND STATE LEVEL, TO MAKE THEIR

01:31:38.359 --> 01:31:40.361
OWN MAPS. SO THE MAPPING IS NOW

01:31:40.428 --> 01:31:41.462
COMPLETELY AT THE DISCRETION OF

01:31:41.529 --> 01:31:43.531
THE PUC. AND IN ADDITION, THE

01:31:43.598 --> 01:31:45.800
CHALLENGE PROCESS IS NOW

01:31:45.867 --> 01:31:47.835
GOVERNED, SELECTED, CONTROLLED

01:31:47.902 --> 01:31:50.471
AND VERIFIED BY THE PUC USING A

01:31:50.538 --> 01:31:52.406
THIRD PARTY. THE ONLY ROLE FOR

01:31:52.473 --> 01:31:54.141
THE COMPANY IS TO REIMBURSE THEM

01:31:54.208 --> 01:31:56.244
FOR THE COSTS OF THE CHALLENGE

01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:58.379
PROCESS. JUST IN ADDITION TO

01:31:58.446 --> 01:32:00.915
THAT, THE AMENDMENTS ADD 180

01:32:00.982 --> 01:32:03.918
DAYS ELIGIBILITY FOR CHALLENGES

01:32:03.985 --> 01:32:06.254
IN WELL SERVED AREAS SO THAT

01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:09.156
UPON NOTIFICATION OF INTENDED

01:32:09.223 --> 01:32:10.992
RELINQUISHMENT, CONSUMER

01:32:11.058 --> 01:32:13.127
CUSTOMER WOULD HAVE SIX MONTHS

01:32:13.194 --> 01:32:15.229
TO RAISE THEIR HAND AND

01:32:15.296 --> 01:32:16.597
CHALLENGE. I JUST UNDERSTAND

01:32:16.664 --> 01:32:18.766
ALSO THAT THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE,

01:32:18.833 --> 01:32:21.769
THE INDEPENDENT AGENT THAT IS

01:32:21.836 --> 01:32:23.871
SET TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE

01:32:23.938 --> 01:32:26.474
PUC, IS STILL IN OPPOSITION TO

01:32:26.540 --> 01:32:28.342
THIS BILL, WITH THAT, WITH EVEN

01:32:28.409 --> 01:32:30.244
WITH THE AMENDMENTS. AND I THINK

01:32:30.311 --> 01:32:31.812
IT LARGELY RELATES TO THIS

01:32:31.879 --> 01:32:33.514
PARTICULAR ASPECT OF BOTH THE

01:32:33.581 --> 01:32:36.250
MAP MAKING PROCESS AND THE

01:32:36.317 --> 01:32:37.952
CHALLENGE PROCESS. SO JUST

01:32:38.019 --> 01:32:39.153
AGAIN, BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE

01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:41.255
SURE THAT WE'RE ALL ABLE TO HEAR

01:32:41.322 --> 01:32:43.224
THIS FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE.

01:32:43.291 --> 01:32:45.159
DOES THE OPPOSITION HAVE ANY

01:32:45.226 --> 01:32:46.794
COMMENT AROUND THE EITHER THE

01:32:46.861 --> 01:32:48.062
MAP MAKING PROCESS OR THE

01:32:48.129 --> 01:32:49.931
CHALLENGE PROCESS FOR US TO TAKE

01:32:49.997 --> 01:32:53.367
UNDER CONSIDERATION? YES. THANK

01:32:53.434 --> 01:32:55.703
YOU. SOME MEMBER VERY BRIEFLY ON

01:32:55.770 --> 01:32:57.538
THE MAPS, THE LANGUAGE OF THE

01:32:57.605 --> 01:33:01.075
BILL REQUIRES THE CPUC TO

01:33:01.142 --> 01:33:03.477
INCLUDE THE DATA FROM THE MAPS

01:33:03.544 --> 01:33:05.746
AND FROM THE FEDERAL WIRELESS

01:33:05.813 --> 01:33:07.882
MAPS. THAT IS MANDATORY TO BE

01:33:07.949 --> 01:33:09.250
INCLUDED IN THE MAPS. IT'S

01:33:09.317 --> 01:33:10.251
UNCLEAR WHAT THAT MEANS. DOES

01:33:10.318 --> 01:33:12.219
THAT MEAN THAT THE MAPS HAVE TO

01:33:12.286 --> 01:33:13.721
STAY WITHIN THE FOUR CORNERS OF

01:33:13.788 --> 01:33:15.523
THOSE, OR IS IT A DIFFERENT MAP?

01:33:15.589 --> 01:33:17.658
SO WE'RE VERY CONCERNED THAT

01:33:17.725 --> 01:33:19.060
THAT BROADBAND MAP AND THAT

01:33:19.126 --> 01:33:20.561
WIRELESS MAP WOULD BE IN THERE.

01:33:20.628 --> 01:33:23.030
AND I BELIEVE, IF I'M NOT

01:33:23.097 --> 01:33:23.631
MISTAKEN, I COULD BE WRONG, I

01:33:23.698 --> 01:33:24.799
APOLOGIZE, THERE'S SOME LANGUAGE

01:33:24.865 --> 01:33:28.002
IN THERE ABOUT REFERENCING

01:33:28.069 --> 01:33:29.136
BROADBAND AVAILABILITY. THERE'S

01:33:29.203 --> 01:33:30.738
BEEN LOTS OF CONCERNS WITH THE

01:33:30.805 --> 01:33:32.473
MAPS, AS WE KNOW. I THINK THIS

01:33:32.540 --> 01:33:33.307
COMMITTEE HAD AN INFORMATIONAL

01:33:33.374 --> 01:33:35.309
HEARING ON THE FIRST VERSION,

01:33:35.376 --> 01:33:36.811
BUT THERE'S BEEN SERIOUS

01:33:36.877 --> 01:33:37.445
CONCERNS ABOUT THE FEDERAL MAPS

01:33:37.511 --> 01:33:39.780
AS FAR AS WIRELESS AS RECENTLY

01:33:39.847 --> 01:33:41.983
AS I THINK A MONTH OR TWO AGO,

01:33:42.049 --> 01:33:44.185
THERE WAS A FEDERAL ENTITY THAT

01:33:44.251 --> 01:33:46.087
ISSUED A STATEMENT REPORT THAT

01:33:46.153 --> 01:33:48.823
STATED THE WIRELESS MAPS, THAT

01:33:48.889 --> 01:33:52.126
INDUSTRY IS OVERSTATING THE

01:33:52.193 --> 01:33:53.394
APPLICATION OR THE AVAILABILITY

01:33:53.461 --> 01:33:55.229
OF COVERAGE, AND THAT THE

01:33:55.296 --> 01:33:56.430
FEDERAL MAPS ARE VERY

01:33:56.497 --> 01:33:57.498
PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE OF THAT,

01:33:57.565 --> 01:33:58.966
THAT IT MAY SAY THAT THERE'S

01:33:59.033 --> 01:34:00.067
COVERAGE THERE FOR WIRELESS, BUT

01:34:00.134 --> 01:34:02.370
THERE REALLY ISN'T. AND HAPPY TO

01:34:02.436 --> 01:34:04.705
I KNOW I'VE TALKED TO TURN ABOUT

01:34:04.772 --> 01:34:06.240
THAT BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW, I ALSO

01:34:06.307 --> 01:34:07.808
WORK FOR TURN. THEY HAVE. BUT WE

01:34:07.875 --> 01:34:09.176
CAN PROVIDE THAT REPORT TO THE

01:34:09.243 --> 01:34:10.378
COMMITTEE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AND

01:34:10.444 --> 01:34:12.213
THAT JUST CAME OUT, I THINK, IN

01:34:12.279 --> 01:34:14.315
APRIL, IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN. FACT

01:34:14.382 --> 01:34:14.882
WE HAVE IT RIGHT HERE, APRIL

01:34:14.949 --> 01:34:16.450
2025, AND IT WAS THE GENERAL

01:34:16.517 --> 01:34:22.289
ACCOUNTING OFFICE. I WANT TO

01:34:22.356 --> 01:34:24.258
MAKE SURE ASSEMBLYMEMBER BONTA

01:34:24.325 --> 01:34:25.693
IS COMPLETE. BEFORE WE GO ON, I

01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:28.262
HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION. OH,

01:34:28.329 --> 01:34:30.231
OKAY. JUST ON THE CPUC. SO WHAT

01:34:30.297 --> 01:34:32.099
WE'RE SAYING IS THAT WE DON'T

01:34:32.166 --> 01:34:33.467
TRUST THE CPUC TO DO THE CORRECT

01:34:33.534 --> 01:34:35.803
MAPS, BECAUSE I IS THAT WHAT

01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:37.938
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING? JUST IT'S

01:34:38.005 --> 01:34:38.706
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAN THAT.

01:34:38.773 --> 01:34:40.241
SOME MEMBER THANK YOU FOR THE

01:34:40.307 --> 01:34:41.742
QUESTION. THE LANGUAGE OF THE

01:34:41.809 --> 01:34:44.078
BILL MANDATES, I'LL PULL UP IN A

01:34:44.145 --> 01:34:45.980
SECOND, MANDATES THAT THE MAPS

01:34:46.047 --> 01:34:49.283
AND THE FEDERAL WIRELESS MAPS,

01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:52.353
THAT DATA BE INCLUDED IN THE MAP

01:34:52.420 --> 01:34:54.355
THAT IS PRODUCED BY THE CPUC. SO

01:34:54.422 --> 01:34:56.924
IT IS NOT A FREE REIN FOR THE

01:34:56.991 --> 01:34:58.025
CPUC TO DEVELOP A MAP. SOMEHOW

01:34:58.092 --> 01:34:59.427
THEY HAVE TO INCLUDE THOSE TWO.

01:34:59.493 --> 01:35:01.262
IT'S REALLY UNCLEAR TO US WHAT

01:35:01.328 --> 01:35:02.663
THAT MEANS. DOES THAT MEAN THAT

01:35:02.730 --> 01:35:03.464
THE MAPS COMMISSION COMES UP

01:35:03.531 --> 01:35:05.699
WITH ONLY HAS TO BE LIKE THOSE

01:35:05.766 --> 01:35:07.635
MAPS, OR CAN IT BE SOMETHING

01:35:07.701 --> 01:35:08.335
DIFFERENT? SO THAT'S SO IT'S NOT

01:35:08.402 --> 01:35:10.704
SO MUCH WE DON'T TRUST THE CÃ°C.

01:35:10.771 --> 01:35:13.374
IT'S A MATTER OF THE MAPS THAT

01:35:13.441 --> 01:35:15.276
ARE REFERENCED IN THIS BILL THAT

01:35:15.342 --> 01:35:16.744
ARE MANDATED TO BE INCLUDED.

01:35:16.811 --> 01:35:18.345
THAT DATA HAS TO BE INCLUDED IN

01:35:18.412 --> 01:35:20.214
THE MAPS THAT THE CPC COMES UP

01:35:20.281 --> 01:35:22.249
WITH UNDER THIS BILL. THAT'S OUR

01:35:22.316 --> 01:35:23.417
CONCERN, THAT MANDATE. BUT I

01:35:23.484 --> 01:35:25.086
ALSO HEARD THAT IT'S THAT THE

01:35:25.152 --> 01:35:27.254
DISCRETION IS WHAT THE CPU WILL

01:35:27.321 --> 01:35:28.222
SEE. THAT'S ALSO INCLUDED IN

01:35:28.289 --> 01:35:29.590
THAT IS INCLUDED IN THE BILL.

01:35:29.657 --> 01:35:31.959
THAT'S A DISCRETION OF THE CPUC.

01:35:32.026 --> 01:35:34.595
THE DATA. I'M TRYING TO

01:35:34.662 --> 01:35:35.863
UNDERSTAND THAT. YEAH, I THINK

01:35:35.930 --> 01:35:36.597
THAT'S WHERE SOME OF THE

01:35:36.664 --> 01:35:38.132
CONFUSION IS BECAUSE THE

01:35:38.199 --> 01:35:40.167
LANGUAGE SAYS THE COMMISSION

01:35:40.234 --> 01:35:42.303
MUST I CAN PULL UP A SECOND.

01:35:42.369 --> 01:35:43.637
THEY MUST INCLUDE THE DATA FROM

01:35:43.704 --> 01:35:45.139
THE BEAD AND THE FEDERAL

01:35:45.206 --> 01:35:46.974
WIRELESS MAPS. THAT IS NOT

01:35:47.041 --> 01:35:48.442
DISCRETIONARY. THAT IS

01:35:48.509 --> 01:35:49.710
MANDATORY. THE QUESTION WE HAVE

01:35:49.777 --> 01:35:52.079
IS WHAT IS THE DISCRETION OF THE

01:35:52.146 --> 01:35:53.614
CPUC TO DEVELOP MAPS, IF, IN

01:35:53.681 --> 01:35:55.583
FACT, THAT THOSE TWO MAPS ARE

01:35:55.649 --> 01:35:57.218
MANDATED TO BE THAT DATA IS

01:35:57.284 --> 01:35:59.019
INCLUDED TO BE THERE. SO WE'RE

01:35:59.086 --> 01:36:00.121
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT

01:36:00.187 --> 01:36:01.722
MEANS. SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

01:36:01.789 --> 01:36:03.257
THOUGH, THAT THOSE MAPS ARE NOT

01:36:03.324 --> 01:36:04.325
GOOD. SO WHAT WHAT OTHER

01:36:04.391 --> 01:36:05.593
INFORMATION WOULD YOU LIKE? WHAT

01:36:05.659 --> 01:36:07.261
OTHER INFORMATION OR WHAT OTHER

01:36:07.328 --> 01:36:09.997
MAPS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE CPUC

01:36:10.064 --> 01:36:11.765
TO USE? SORRY, I JUST WANT TO

01:36:11.832 --> 01:36:13.000
FOLLOW. YEAH, NO, THANK YOU FOR

01:36:13.067 --> 01:36:14.435
THE QUESTION. THOSE ARE THINGS

01:36:14.502 --> 01:36:16.537
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO NOW THAT

01:36:16.604 --> 01:36:17.271
THE LANGUAGE CAME OUT ON

01:36:17.338 --> 01:36:18.239
THURSDAY. THAT'S SOME OF THE

01:36:18.305 --> 01:36:19.373
STUFF THAT WE'VE BEEN STARTING

01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:21.275
TO LOOK AT AND FIGURE OUT WHAT

01:36:21.342 --> 01:36:22.776
THE ALTERNATIVES ARE. BUT BUT

01:36:22.843 --> 01:36:24.078
REQUIRING THAT DATA TO BE IN

01:36:24.145 --> 01:36:25.079
THERE. OUR INITIAL READING.

01:36:25.146 --> 01:36:26.247
THAT'S MY QUESTION THOUGH. DO

01:36:26.313 --> 01:36:28.382
YOU KNOW IF THERE IS ANOTHER WAY

01:36:28.449 --> 01:36:30.117
TO DEVELOP THOSE MAPS? I THINK

01:36:30.184 --> 01:36:31.752
THE QUESTION THAT I WAS ASKING

01:36:31.819 --> 01:36:33.053
ALSO ASKED FOR YOU ALL TO TALK

01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:35.122
MORE ABOUT THIS ON THE GROUND

01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:36.357
CERTIFICATION PROCESS, WHICH IS

01:36:36.423 --> 01:36:38.359
AN ALTERNATIVE WAY TO AT LEAST

01:36:38.425 --> 01:36:41.228
VALIDATE THE SELF-REPORTED

01:36:41.295 --> 01:36:42.396
INFORMATION THAT GOES THROUGH

01:36:42.463 --> 01:36:44.498
THE BEAD AND THE KIND OF THE

01:36:44.565 --> 01:36:46.433
FEDERAL PROCESS, SO THAT THAT IS

01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:49.003
AN ADDITIONAL WAY. OKAY. DO YOU

01:36:49.069 --> 01:36:50.838
ALL WANT TO SPEAK TO THAT? YEAH,

01:36:50.905 --> 01:36:52.206
IT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE

01:36:52.273 --> 01:36:54.308
AS WE'VE SEEN, THE MAPS AT THE

01:36:54.375 --> 01:36:55.743
FCC ARE VERY, VERY INACCURATE.

01:36:55.809 --> 01:36:58.679
AND THAT IS WHY OREGON HAS THE

01:36:58.746 --> 01:36:59.747
BOOTS ON THE GROUND VERIFICATION

01:36:59.813 --> 01:37:00.814
AS PART OF THEIR COLA

01:37:00.881 --> 01:37:02.683
REQUIREMENT, PARTICULARLY IN

01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:03.751
CALIFORNIA, WHEN IT'S UNCERTAIN

01:37:03.817 --> 01:37:05.152
WHERE A LOT OF THE SERVICE

01:37:05.219 --> 01:37:07.655
ACTUALLY EXISTS. AND IF IT'S NOT

01:37:07.721 --> 01:37:09.790
VERIFIED TO DEEM A PLACE WELL

01:37:09.857 --> 01:37:11.625
SERVED, EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVEN'T

01:37:11.692 --> 01:37:14.595
ACTUALLY VERIFIED THAT IT IS

01:37:14.662 --> 01:37:17.398
SERVED, IS A MISTAKE. SO THAT'S

01:37:17.464 --> 01:37:19.066
WHAT THE CHALLENGE PROCESS IS

01:37:19.133 --> 01:37:22.369
FOR. BECAUSE IF WE DON'T HAVE WE

01:37:22.436 --> 01:37:24.205
CAN'T JUST SAY NO, OUR

01:37:24.271 --> 01:37:26.106
INFRASTRUCTURE IS BREAKING DOWN.

01:37:26.173 --> 01:37:28.509
AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:37:28.576 --> 01:37:29.210
WE'RE UPDATING. THAT'S THE

01:37:29.276 --> 01:37:31.245
INTENT OF THIS BILL IS TO UPDATE

01:37:31.312 --> 01:37:32.913
OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. AND SO WE

01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:34.982
HAVE TO START WE THAT'S WHAT THE

01:37:35.049 --> 01:37:36.417
CHALLENGE PROCESS IS FOR. THAT'S

01:37:36.483 --> 01:37:38.519
WHAT THE CPUC IS FOR. THAT'S WHY

01:37:38.586 --> 01:37:39.920
WE'RE GOING WE'RE PUTTING IT

01:37:39.987 --> 01:37:42.957
BEFORE THEM. AND SO THAT'S THE

01:37:43.023 --> 01:37:44.458
UP TO DATE MAPS THAT WE HAVE

01:37:44.525 --> 01:37:48.128
RIGHT NOW. BUT THERE'S I DON'T

01:37:48.195 --> 01:37:49.396
KNOW IF I'M ALLOWED TO I'M

01:37:49.463 --> 01:37:51.332
SORRY. OKAY. YEAH I APPRECIATE

01:37:51.398 --> 01:37:53.167
THAT. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:37:53.234 --> 01:37:57.605
I THINK MY TAKE LIKE IT'S

01:37:57.671 --> 01:38:01.575
SOMETHING WHEN SO MANY

01:38:01.642 --> 01:38:02.776
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE ARE

01:38:02.843 --> 01:38:05.212
DEEPLY FOCUSED ON DIGITAL EQUITY

01:38:05.279 --> 01:38:07.715
ARE STILL STANDING IN OPPOSITION

01:38:07.781 --> 01:38:12.486
TO THIS BILL, IT. AT LEAST CALLS

01:38:12.553 --> 01:38:14.154
FOR US TO ASK THE QUESTION

01:38:14.221 --> 01:38:17.191
AROUND WHETHER OR NOT THE

01:38:17.258 --> 01:38:18.425
REPLACEMENTS THAT WE ARE MOVING

01:38:18.492 --> 01:38:20.027
TOWARDS. I'M NOT OPPOSED TO I'M

01:38:20.094 --> 01:38:21.629
NOT TRYING TO HAVE US JUST SAY

01:38:21.695 --> 01:38:24.265
NO, BUT I AM SEEKING TO MAKE

01:38:24.331 --> 01:38:26.000
SURE THAT WE'RE PUTTING

01:38:26.066 --> 01:38:27.134
SOMETHING IN PLACE THAT WILL

01:38:27.201 --> 01:38:31.639
ENSURE A TRANSITION THAT WILL

01:38:31.705 --> 01:38:33.741
NOT IMPACT OUR MOST VULNERABLE

01:38:33.807 --> 01:38:35.142
CALIFORNIANS, AND THAT DON'T

01:38:35.209 --> 01:38:37.711
DOESN'T HAVE A PATH FOR THE

01:38:37.778 --> 01:38:40.914
WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN PRIMARILY

01:38:40.981 --> 01:38:43.417
SUPPORTING THIS INFRASTRUCTURE

01:38:43.484 --> 01:38:45.219
TO NOT BE HANDLED. SO THOSE ARE

01:38:45.286 --> 01:38:46.654
I MEAN, THAT THAT'S REALLY THE

01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:49.123
SOURCE OF MY QUESTIONING. AND

01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:52.326
YOU KNOW THAT FROM ME, I THINK

01:38:52.393 --> 01:38:55.396
THE ISSUE THAT I HAVE WITH THE

01:38:55.462 --> 01:38:56.930
CHALLENGE PROCESS IS THAT THAT

01:38:56.997 --> 01:38:58.232
CHALLENGE PROCESS IS EX POST,

01:38:58.299 --> 01:38:59.533
RIGHT? THE DAMAGE HAS ALREADY

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:02.903
BEEN DONE. YOU HAVE TO RELY ON

01:39:02.970 --> 01:39:05.439
SOMEBODY TO HAVE THE ABILITY,

01:39:05.506 --> 01:39:09.343
FACILITY CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO

01:39:09.410 --> 01:39:13.881
JUMP IN AND, AND, AND INDICATE

01:39:13.947 --> 01:39:15.582
THAT THEY HAVE A PROBLEM. AND

01:39:15.649 --> 01:39:17.251
THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THE

01:39:17.318 --> 01:39:19.853
MOST VULNERABLE WHO DON'T HAVE

01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:21.455
THE RESOURCES THAT MANY DO TO BE

01:39:21.522 --> 01:39:23.490
ABLE TO COME FORWARD AND DO

01:39:23.557 --> 01:39:24.992
THAT. SO I'M THE QUESTIONS I'M

01:39:25.059 --> 01:39:27.094
ASKING AROUND THE DEVELOPMENT OF

01:39:27.161 --> 01:39:29.096
THE PROCESS ARE JUST IS IT

01:39:29.163 --> 01:39:30.864
COMPLETE ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO

01:39:30.931 --> 01:39:33.867
KEEP FEWER CHALLENGES FROM BEING

01:39:33.934 --> 01:39:35.669
MADE? AND THAT'S KIND OF THE

01:39:35.736 --> 01:39:39.106
NATURE OF MY QUESTION ON THAT

01:39:39.173 --> 01:39:42.843
LAST QUESTION FOR ME IS RELATED

01:39:42.910 --> 01:39:45.646
TO THE OVERALL. THE OTHER ISSUE

01:39:45.713 --> 01:39:47.214
I HAD WAS AROUND COMMUNITY

01:39:47.281 --> 01:39:51.452
BENEFIT. AND, AND I UNDERSTAND

01:39:51.518 --> 01:39:54.288
THAT THE AMENDMENTS NOW DOUBLE

01:39:54.355 --> 01:39:58.392
THE AMOUNT OF REINVESTMENTS, BUT

01:39:58.459 --> 01:39:59.827
ALSO EXTEND THE TIMELINE FOR

01:39:59.893 --> 01:40:03.397
THAT REINVESTMENT TO HAPPEN OVER

01:40:03.464 --> 01:40:07.234
SIX YEARS. WITHIN THAT TIME

01:40:07.301 --> 01:40:09.069
PERIOD. MY SPECIFIC QUESTION IS,

01:40:09.136 --> 01:40:11.672
IS THERE AN OPPORTUNITY REALLY

01:40:11.739 --> 01:40:15.576
TO UNDERSTAND OR KNOW WHETHER

01:40:15.642 --> 01:40:17.611
NEW COMMUNITIES THAT MAY COME

01:40:17.678 --> 01:40:19.513
ONLINE WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO

01:40:19.580 --> 01:40:23.117
HAVE LIFELINE OFFERED TO THEM,

01:40:23.183 --> 01:40:27.488
SO THAT OR MORE SPECIFICALLY,

01:40:27.554 --> 01:40:29.656
WHERE THE REINVESTMENT IS

01:40:29.723 --> 01:40:31.058
ACTUALLY HAPPENING. I THINK THE

01:40:31.125 --> 01:40:32.860
OPPOSITION RAISED SOMETHING, A

01:40:32.926 --> 01:40:36.363
CONCERN AROUND IS IT GOING TO BE

01:40:36.430 --> 01:40:37.931
REMEDYING EXISTING

01:40:37.998 --> 01:40:41.769
INFRASTRUCTURE, OR IS THE COUNT

01:40:41.835 --> 01:40:42.736
FOR ADDITIONAL BUILDS REALLY

01:40:42.803 --> 01:40:45.038
GOING TO GO TOWARDS THE WORK

01:40:45.105 --> 01:40:47.908
THAT THE CARRIER WOULD HAVE

01:40:47.975 --> 01:40:50.944
ALREADY BEEN DOING ANYWAY TO

01:40:51.011 --> 01:40:53.814
EXPAND THEIR FIBER NETWORK? NO,

01:40:53.881 --> 01:40:56.717
THIS IS A 3 TO 1 WHEN THEY PULL

01:40:56.784 --> 01:40:58.051
OUT OF ONE HOUSEHOLD, THEY'LL

01:40:58.118 --> 01:40:59.953
BUILD OUT THREE. THAT WASN'T A

01:41:00.020 --> 01:41:03.090
THAT WASN'T PREEXISTING, BUT

01:41:03.157 --> 01:41:05.459
WHICH HOUSEHOLDS I THINK IS THE

01:41:05.526 --> 01:41:07.094
QUESTION FOR ME. SURE. THANK

01:41:07.161 --> 01:41:09.696
YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. SO WHAT

01:41:09.763 --> 01:41:11.465
THESE AMENDMENTS DO IS TRIPLE

01:41:11.532 --> 01:41:13.066
THE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT

01:41:13.133 --> 01:41:14.868
REQUIRED PER COACHELLA

01:41:14.935 --> 01:41:17.070
RELINQUISHMENT, PER RESIDENTIAL

01:41:17.137 --> 01:41:18.872
RELINQUISHMENT LINE. AS FAR AS

01:41:18.939 --> 01:41:22.543
AN ANALYSIS ON SORT OF COST AND

01:41:22.609 --> 01:41:24.244
INVESTMENT, AS YOU ALLUDED TO,

01:41:24.311 --> 01:41:28.649
IS IT'S DIFFICULT TO DO.

01:41:28.715 --> 01:41:30.384
CERTAINLY IT'S WELL BEYOND WHAT

01:41:30.451 --> 01:41:31.852
OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURE

01:41:31.919 --> 01:41:33.020
INVESTMENT HAS BEEN IN THE PAST

01:41:33.086 --> 01:41:34.221
FEW YEARS. SO IT'S ABOVE AND

01:41:34.288 --> 01:41:36.123
BEYOND. ABSOLUTELY. TO GIVE YOU

01:41:36.190 --> 01:41:37.558
AN EXACT NUMBER IS SOMEWHAT

01:41:37.624 --> 01:41:39.126
DIFFICULT BECAUSE IT'S DEPENDENT

01:41:39.193 --> 01:41:40.894
UPON THE PUC AND THE STATE

01:41:40.961 --> 01:41:43.063
ACTUALLY APPROVING COACHELLA

01:41:43.130 --> 01:41:44.865
RELINQUISHMENT. SO FOR EVERY

01:41:44.932 --> 01:41:46.767
LINE THAT WE RECEIVE, COACHELLA

01:41:46.834 --> 01:41:48.469
RELINQUISHMENT ON AT&amp;T WILL

01:41:48.535 --> 01:41:51.338
BUILD ESSENTIALLY THREE MORE.

01:41:51.405 --> 01:41:53.173
BUT IT'S TIED TO THAT. SO IT'S

01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:55.309
HARD TO GIVE A FIRM NUMBER WHEN

01:41:55.375 --> 01:41:57.311
THERE'S A VERY EXTENSIVE PROCESS

01:41:57.377 --> 01:41:59.246
IN FRONT OF YOU AT THE PUC

01:41:59.313 --> 01:42:01.782
THAT'S GOING TO TAKE AT LEAST

01:42:01.849 --> 01:42:03.150
PROBABLY 2 TO 3 YEARS TO EVEN

01:42:03.217 --> 01:42:06.019
BEGIN. IT'S HARD TO DO AN

01:42:06.086 --> 01:42:07.654
ANALYSIS ON EXACT LINES UNTIL WE

01:42:07.721 --> 01:42:09.556
CAN OPERATIONALIZE THE PROCESS.

01:42:09.623 --> 01:42:11.091
THAT EVEN WOULD LEAD THE STATE

01:42:11.158 --> 01:42:12.559
TO APPROVING COACHELLA

01:42:12.626 --> 01:42:13.994
RELINQUISHMENT. SO I WOULD I

01:42:14.061 --> 01:42:15.195
HOPE THAT IT'S AN INCENTIVE FOR

01:42:15.262 --> 01:42:18.365
THE STATE TO APPROVE COACHELLA

01:42:18.432 --> 01:42:20.400
RELINQUISHMENT. BUT THOSE LINES

01:42:20.467 --> 01:42:23.604
ARE ARE REALLY BUILT UPON THE

01:42:23.670 --> 01:42:24.771
RELINQUISHMENT WHEN IT'S

01:42:24.838 --> 01:42:27.708
GRANTED, IF THAT MAKES SENSE. I

01:42:27.774 --> 01:42:29.510
DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.

01:42:29.576 --> 01:42:31.211
I WILL JUST SAY I VERY MUCH

01:42:31.278 --> 01:42:32.679
APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S

01:42:32.746 --> 01:42:34.815
CONTINUED WORK ON THIS BILL, AND

01:42:34.882 --> 01:42:38.118
FOR HEARING MY CONCERNS, BECAUSE

01:42:38.185 --> 01:42:41.021
THERE ARE SO MANY DIGITAL EQUITY

01:42:41.088 --> 01:42:42.756
ADVOCACY GROUPS WHO STILL HAVE

01:42:42.823 --> 01:42:45.325
SERIOUS CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL.

01:42:45.392 --> 01:42:47.394
AND BECAUSE WE HAVE OPPOSITION

01:42:47.461 --> 01:42:49.763
FROM BOTH THE CWA AND THE

01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:51.832
CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION IN

01:42:51.899 --> 01:42:53.267
ITS CURRENT FORM, I'M NOT GOING

01:42:53.333 --> 01:42:55.402
TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL

01:42:55.469 --> 01:42:56.937
TODAY, ALTHOUGH I'M PRETTY SURE

01:42:57.004 --> 01:42:59.806
YOU HAVE THE VOTES TO BE ABLE TO

01:42:59.873 --> 01:43:00.574
MOVE THIS, MOVE THIS BILL

01:43:00.641 --> 01:43:03.010
FORWARD. BUT AND I KNOW THAT YOU

01:43:03.076 --> 01:43:08.048
WILL. TAKE INTO ACCOUNT MY

01:43:08.115 --> 01:43:11.285
ONGOING CONCERNS, I APPRECIATE

01:43:11.351 --> 01:43:12.619
THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO.

01:43:12.686 --> 01:43:14.922
YES. FOLLOWING UP ON ON, WE

01:43:14.988 --> 01:43:15.989
TALKED ABOUT ALL THE ADVOCACY

01:43:16.056 --> 01:43:17.758
GROUPS THAT ARE HERE. AND I ALSO

01:43:17.824 --> 01:43:19.660
HEARD THE WORD BOOTS ON THE

01:43:19.726 --> 01:43:23.230
GROUND. YOU HAVE ALLOWED OR PART

01:43:23.297 --> 01:43:24.998
OF THE BILL IS THAT ONE PERSON

01:43:25.065 --> 01:43:27.834
CAN CAN BASICALLY SAY, YOU KNOW,

01:43:27.901 --> 01:43:30.003
WE WANT TO REVIEW THE PROCESS.

01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:31.305
CORRECT. IF THAT'S THE CASE, WE

01:43:31.371 --> 01:43:33.273
HAVE MANY ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS

01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:35.142
HERE THAT CAN STEP IN AND SAY,

01:43:35.208 --> 01:43:37.578
HEY, I'M THE ONE PERSON OR WE'RE

01:43:37.644 --> 01:43:38.312
THE ONE ORGANIZATION THAT'S

01:43:38.378 --> 01:43:39.880
OPPOSING. SO YOU'VE ALLOWED FOR

01:43:39.947 --> 01:43:41.648
180 DAYS AND ONE PERSON, ONE

01:43:41.715 --> 01:43:45.118
PERSON CAN CAN OPPOSE WHATEVER

01:43:45.185 --> 01:43:50.724
THE CPUC IS PROPOSING. IS THAT

01:43:50.791 --> 01:43:54.328
CORRECT? YES. I WAS ACTUALLY

01:43:54.394 --> 01:43:56.163
DISCUSSED QUITE A BIT IN THE

01:43:56.229 --> 01:43:58.432
NEGOTIATIONS, AND SOME OF THE

01:43:58.498 --> 01:44:00.300
PARTIES WERE ADVOCATING, AND IT

01:44:00.367 --> 01:44:03.503
WAS BUILT INTO THE BILL WHERE A

01:44:03.570 --> 01:44:04.838
PERSON IN THAT CENSUS BLOCK OR

01:44:04.905 --> 01:44:07.441
IN THAT AREA COULD CHALLENGE THE

01:44:07.507 --> 01:44:09.209
PROCESS, OR AN ENTITY ON BEHALF

01:44:09.276 --> 01:44:10.611
OF THAT PERSON COULD CHALLENGE

01:44:10.677 --> 01:44:13.113
THE PROCESS. AND KHÃ

01:44:13.180 --> 01:44:14.615
RELINQUISHMENT CANNOT BE GRANTED

01:44:14.681 --> 01:44:16.383
UNTIL ALL CHALLENGES ARE

01:44:16.450 --> 01:44:18.585
RESOLVED. SO, NO, THERE'S NO

01:44:18.652 --> 01:44:22.155
SORT OF DAMAGE OR ANYTHING DONE.

01:44:22.222 --> 01:44:23.924
NO COLOR CAN BE GRANTED

01:44:23.991 --> 01:44:25.092
RELINQUISHMENT UNTIL ALL

01:44:25.158 --> 01:44:26.126
CHALLENGES ARE RESOLVED. OKAY,

01:44:26.193 --> 01:44:27.995
SO THEN FOR ME, THAT MAKES ME

01:44:28.061 --> 01:44:30.897
FEEL COMFORTABLE BECAUSE ONE

01:44:30.964 --> 01:44:32.032
PERSON OR ONE ENTITY CAN

01:44:32.099 --> 01:44:33.033
CHALLENGE IT. AND YOU'VE

01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:35.135
EXTENDED THE, THE, I GUESS THE

01:44:35.202 --> 01:44:37.437
TIMELINE TO 180 DAYS TO BE ABLE

01:44:37.504 --> 01:44:38.872
TO CHALLENGE THAT. SO I'M

01:44:38.939 --> 01:44:39.640
COMFORTABLE WITH THAT BECAUSE

01:44:39.706 --> 01:44:41.208
THAT GIVES THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:44:41.274 --> 01:44:42.709
ALL OUR ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS

01:44:42.776 --> 01:44:44.378
AND CWA TO BE ABLE TO CHALLENGE.

01:44:44.444 --> 01:44:47.147
IF, IN FACT, THERE'S SOMETHING

01:44:47.214 --> 01:44:51.318
THAT IS NOT, YOU KNOW, CLEAR FOR

01:44:51.385 --> 01:44:53.854
THEM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU,

01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:55.856
ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROGERS. THANK

01:44:55.922 --> 01:44:57.758
YOU SO MUCH, CHAIR. SO THE

01:44:57.824 --> 01:44:59.226
QUESTION ON THE MAPPING, I THINK

01:44:59.292 --> 01:45:01.595
IS A REALLY GOOD ONE. MY

01:45:01.662 --> 01:45:02.262
PREDECESSOR ACTUALLY HAD A BILL,

01:45:02.329 --> 01:45:05.399
AB 286 THAT IT MAY BE WORTH

01:45:05.465 --> 01:45:06.500
LOOKING AT WHAT THAT PROCESS

01:45:06.566 --> 01:45:07.934
THAT WAS ESTABLISHED FOR THE

01:45:08.001 --> 01:45:09.302
MAPS ARE. MY UNDERSTANDING IS

01:45:09.369 --> 01:45:11.705
THAT THE BILL DIDN'T HAVE A

01:45:11.772 --> 01:45:12.873
TIMELINE FOR IMPLEMENTATION NOR

01:45:12.939 --> 01:45:14.374
FUNDING FOR IT THROUGH THE CPUC,

01:45:14.441 --> 01:45:16.643
BUT IT MIGHT BE WORTH LOOKING AT

01:45:16.710 --> 01:45:17.978
THAT AND SEEING WHETHER ADDING

01:45:18.045 --> 01:45:20.514
IN A TIMELINE COULD RESOLVE SOME

01:45:20.580 --> 01:45:23.083
OF THOSE CONCERNS THAT EXIST OUT

01:45:23.150 --> 01:45:29.156
THERE. THANK YOU. OKAY, SO I

01:45:29.222 --> 01:45:30.123
HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE

01:45:30.190 --> 01:45:31.358
OPPOSITION SPECIFICALLY

01:45:31.425 --> 01:45:33.060
REGARDING THE MAPS. WE SPENT A

01:45:33.126 --> 01:45:34.461
LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT MAPS.

01:45:34.528 --> 01:45:36.029
AND WHILE I HEAR YOUR CONCERNS

01:45:36.096 --> 01:45:37.431
THAT THEY'RE NOT COMPLETELY

01:45:37.497 --> 01:45:39.599
ACCURATE, DO YOU AGREE THAT BOTH

01:45:39.666 --> 01:45:41.068
THE MAPS AND THE FCC MAPS ARE

01:45:41.134 --> 01:45:42.736
THE MOST ROBUST, GRANULAR, AND

01:45:42.803 --> 01:45:45.706
SCRUTINIZED MAPS OF ANY

01:45:45.772 --> 01:45:49.643
BROADBAND AVAILABILITY THAT WE

01:45:49.710 --> 01:45:52.846
HAVE IN THE STATE TO DATE? DO

01:45:52.913 --> 01:45:54.915
YOU MIND REPEATING THAT, MADAM

01:45:54.981 --> 01:45:59.486
CHAIR? DO YOU AGREE THAT THE

01:45:59.553 --> 01:46:01.421
BEAD AND FCC MAPS ARE THE MOST

01:46:01.488 --> 01:46:02.856
ROBUST, GRANULAR, AND

01:46:02.923 --> 01:46:06.593
SCRUTINIZED MAPS OF BROADBAND

01:46:06.660 --> 01:46:09.763
AVAILABILITY TO DATE? ARE THERE

01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:11.832
BETTER MAPS? SINCE IT'S

01:46:11.898 --> 01:46:15.068
REFERENCING BROAD BAND? I DON'T

01:46:15.135 --> 01:46:18.338
KNOW. SO BEAD IS BROADBAND.

01:46:18.405 --> 01:46:20.540
YEAH. SO THE BEAD MAPS AND THE

01:46:20.607 --> 01:46:22.242
IDEA OF THIS BILL IS YOU START

01:46:22.309 --> 01:46:24.478
WITH THE MOST, IN MY OPINION,

01:46:24.544 --> 01:46:26.413
SCRUTINIZE GRANULAR MAPS WE HAVE

01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:28.081
AND THAT'S WHY THEY'RE IN THE

01:46:28.148 --> 01:46:29.449
BILL. THEY'RE THE STARTING

01:46:29.516 --> 01:46:32.052
POINT. I'VE NEVER SEEN THE CPUC

01:46:32.119 --> 01:46:34.621
NOT TAKE DISCRETION AND I'M NOT

01:46:34.688 --> 01:46:37.691
SURE WHY THEY WOULD START NOW.

01:46:37.758 --> 01:46:39.292
SOMETIMES WE LIKE WHEN THEY TAKE

01:46:39.359 --> 01:46:40.260
DISCRETION. SOMETIMES WE DON'T

01:46:40.327 --> 01:46:41.661
LIKE WHEN THEY TAKE DISCRETION.

01:46:41.728 --> 01:46:43.463
BUT I WOULD SAY THEY WOULD BE

01:46:43.530 --> 01:46:46.166
TRUE TO FORM. AND THE DATA ON

01:46:46.233 --> 01:46:49.136
THE MAPS HAS BEEN REVIEWED BY

01:46:49.202 --> 01:46:51.738
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. THERE WERE

01:46:51.805 --> 01:46:54.274
2 MILLION ERRORS AND THERE WERE

01:46:54.341 --> 01:46:56.109
2 MILLION CORRECTIONS TO THE

01:46:56.176 --> 01:46:58.712
MAPS. SO THEY ARE OUR MOST

01:46:58.779 --> 01:47:00.046
GRANULAR, OUR MOST SCRUTINIZED

01:47:00.113 --> 01:47:02.482
MAPS. ARE THEY PERFECT? NO,

01:47:02.549 --> 01:47:04.017
THEY'RE NOT PERFECT. BUT THAT'S

01:47:04.084 --> 01:47:05.585
WHY THEY'RE THE STARTING POINT.

01:47:05.652 --> 01:47:09.322
THEY'RE NOT THE END POINT. AND

01:47:09.389 --> 01:47:13.093
SO WHEN WE LOOK WHEN THE CPUC

01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:14.361
OPENS THEIR NEW RULEMAKING,

01:47:14.427 --> 01:47:16.229
THEY'RE ONCE AGAIN BE AN

01:47:16.296 --> 01:47:17.531
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PUBLIC TO

01:47:17.597 --> 01:47:18.799
PROVIDE INPUT ON THOSE MAPS

01:47:18.865 --> 01:47:20.600
BEFORE IT'S ADOPTED BY THE CPUC.

01:47:20.667 --> 01:47:23.103
AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY,

01:47:23.170 --> 01:47:25.105
ADOPTING THE MAPS BY THE CPUC

01:47:25.172 --> 01:47:26.840
WAS AN AMENDMENT THAT THIS

01:47:26.907 --> 01:47:29.342
COMMITTEE MADE TO THE BILL. WE

01:47:29.409 --> 01:47:30.277
SAID, START WITH THAT, BUT

01:47:30.343 --> 01:47:32.045
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO

01:47:32.112 --> 01:47:33.180
THROUGH THAT. AND IT'S HARD

01:47:33.246 --> 01:47:34.781
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE

01:47:34.848 --> 01:47:36.349
WANT TO TAKE THE EXISTING MAPS,

01:47:36.416 --> 01:47:37.651
BUT WE'RE LIKE, NO, WE DON'T

01:47:37.717 --> 01:47:40.253
WANT TO LEAVE ANYBODY BEHIND.

01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:41.988
NOBODY WANTS TO LEAVE ANYBODY

01:47:42.055 --> 01:47:44.391
BEHIND. IF THERE'S ONE HOUSEHOLD

01:47:44.457 --> 01:47:46.393
THAT COULD BE LEFT BEHIND, THEY

01:47:46.459 --> 01:47:47.961
WILL NOT GET COLA RELIEF. AND

01:47:48.028 --> 01:47:49.162
JUST REMEMBER, THIS IS A BILL

01:47:49.229 --> 01:47:50.463
ABOUT COLA RELIEF. AND WE HAVE

01:47:50.530 --> 01:47:52.132
AT&amp;T HERE. THE REASON FRONTIER

01:47:52.199 --> 01:47:53.533
FRONTIER IS THE OTHER CARRIER OF

01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:56.937
LAST RESORT IN THE STATE OF

01:47:57.003 --> 01:47:58.471
CALIFORNIA. SO THIS PROCESS

01:47:58.538 --> 01:47:59.840
WOULD APPLY TO FRONTIER TWO

01:47:59.906 --> 01:48:01.341
SHOULD THEY EVER SEEK COLA

01:48:01.408 --> 01:48:04.211
RELIEF. SO WE TALK ABOUT IT THAT

01:48:04.277 --> 01:48:06.279
WAY. BUT WHAT WE WANT IS THAT

01:48:06.346 --> 01:48:09.683
BIGGER PICTURE. AND ON THE BACK

01:48:09.749 --> 01:48:10.617
END, THERE WILL ALSO BE A

01:48:10.684 --> 01:48:12.152
CHALLENGE PROCESS FOR ANY

01:48:12.219 --> 01:48:12.853
INDIVIDUAL HOUSEHOLD TO

01:48:12.919 --> 01:48:14.988
CHALLENGE THEIR DESIGNATION AS

01:48:15.055 --> 01:48:17.190
WELL SERVED. AND WE REQUIRE

01:48:17.257 --> 01:48:19.292
THERE BE A TEN DAY, TEN YEAR

01:48:19.359 --> 01:48:21.494
DOOMSDAY SCENARIO TO PREVENT

01:48:21.561 --> 01:48:24.364
EXACTLY THE SCENARIO WHERE ONE

01:48:24.431 --> 01:48:26.132
HOUSEHOLD IS LEFT BEHIND THERE

01:48:26.199 --> 01:48:28.134
COULD, YOU KNOW, THEY DIDN'T

01:48:28.201 --> 01:48:30.670
KNOW A WIRELESS PROVIDER OR A

01:48:30.737 --> 01:48:33.206
WIRELINE PROVIDER GOES BELLY UP.

01:48:33.273 --> 01:48:35.742
THEY NO LONGER SERVE THAT AREA.

01:48:35.809 --> 01:48:37.644
AT&amp;T WILL COME BACK IN AND

01:48:37.711 --> 01:48:40.113
PROVIDE VOICE FOR THOSE

01:48:40.180 --> 01:48:42.482
HOUSEHOLDS. THERE IS THE IDEA OF

01:48:42.549 --> 01:48:44.117
THIS BILL. WHEN IT LEFT, OUR

01:48:44.184 --> 01:48:45.619
COMMITTEE WAS THERE'S BACKUP

01:48:45.685 --> 01:48:48.154
UPON BACKUP UPON BACKUP, BECAUSE

01:48:48.221 --> 01:48:50.423
WE WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO

01:48:50.490 --> 01:48:52.726
VOICE. AND THE BROADBAND MAPS

01:48:52.792 --> 01:48:54.294
WERE AN INDICATION THEY'RE NOT

01:48:54.361 --> 01:48:55.962
PERFECT BECAUSE IT'S NOT VOICE.

01:48:56.029 --> 01:48:57.497
MANY MORE PEOPLE PROBABLY HAVE

01:48:57.564 --> 01:48:59.966
VOICE THAN THEY HAVE BROADBAND.

01:49:00.033 --> 01:49:03.503
SO IT'S A STARTING POINT, AND I

01:49:03.570 --> 01:49:05.105
THINK IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO

01:49:05.171 --> 01:49:06.406
REINVENT THE WHEEL WHEN WE

01:49:06.473 --> 01:49:07.841
ALREADY HAVE A GREAT STARTING

01:49:07.908 --> 01:49:10.043
POINT. AND THE CPUC WILL

01:49:10.110 --> 01:49:12.178
HOPEFULLY MAKE IT BETTER. AND

01:49:12.245 --> 01:49:14.214
NOTHING IN THIS BILL PRECLUDES

01:49:14.281 --> 01:49:16.549
THE CPUC FROM MAKING UPDATES TO

01:49:16.616 --> 01:49:19.853
THE MAP. AND THE INTEREST OF

01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:24.157
ACCURACY. SO ARE THERE ANY MORE

01:49:24.224 --> 01:49:32.365
QUESTIONS? OH, OKAY. WE HAVE A.

01:49:32.432 --> 01:49:35.502
WE HAVE A MOTION BY A SECOND BY

01:49:35.568 --> 01:49:37.504
RUBIO. ASSEMBLYMEMBER KENNER,

01:49:37.570 --> 01:49:39.205
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE? YES. I

01:49:39.272 --> 01:49:41.708
WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY TO MY

01:49:41.775 --> 01:49:45.712
COLLEAGUES AND TO, TO THE

01:49:45.779 --> 01:49:47.147
PUBLIC, MY RECORD SHOWS THAT I

01:49:47.213 --> 01:49:48.682
HAVE ALWAYS LOOKED OUT FOR THE

01:49:48.748 --> 01:49:50.450
LEAST OF THOSE. IF YOU GO

01:49:50.517 --> 01:49:52.652
THROUGH MY THREE YEARS HERE AT

01:49:52.719 --> 01:49:55.021
THE IN THE LEGISLATURE, MY VOTE

01:49:55.088 --> 01:49:57.490
SHOW THAT I AM A PERSON THAT

01:49:57.557 --> 01:49:59.726
WILL NEVER LEAVE ANYONE BEHIND.

01:49:59.793 --> 01:50:03.096
AND IT ALSO SHOWS THAT I AM 100%

01:50:03.163 --> 01:50:07.367
LABOR VOTER. I WILL. I WORKED

01:50:07.434 --> 01:50:09.436
FOR LABOR AND I LOOK OUT FOR

01:50:09.502 --> 01:50:10.503
LABOR, I LOOK OUT FOR WORKERS.

01:50:10.570 --> 01:50:13.406
AND SO I MEAN, AND MOST OF MY

01:50:13.473 --> 01:50:15.108
COLLEAGUES HAVE SERVED WITH ME

01:50:15.175 --> 01:50:17.010
THESE THREE YEARS KNOW THAT. AND

01:50:17.077 --> 01:50:18.912
SO THIS THIS DOESN'T THINGS

01:50:18.979 --> 01:50:20.780
DON'T CHANGE. I STILL I'M STILL

01:50:20.847 --> 01:50:22.048
LOOKING OUT FOR THE LEAST OF

01:50:22.115 --> 01:50:23.950
THOSE AND I'M STILL LOOKING OUT

01:50:24.017 --> 01:50:25.051
FOR WORKERS. BUT WHAT I AM

01:50:25.118 --> 01:50:27.654
CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT ONLY 5%

01:50:27.721 --> 01:50:29.656
OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE THESE

01:50:29.723 --> 01:50:33.460
COPPER LINE PHONES. 5%. THAT'S A

01:50:33.526 --> 01:50:35.962
PROBLEM. AND COPPER IS IT'S

01:50:36.029 --> 01:50:38.898
BECOMING OBSOLETE. IF WE DON'T

01:50:38.965 --> 01:50:39.666
DO SOMETHING LIKE THE REST OF

01:50:39.733 --> 01:50:41.001
OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE STATE

01:50:41.067 --> 01:50:43.370
OF CALIFORNIA, OUR

01:50:43.436 --> 01:50:44.337
TELECOMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE

01:50:44.404 --> 01:50:46.606
WILL BE HARMED. PEOPLE WILL NOT

01:50:46.673 --> 01:50:48.641
BE ABLE TO USE THESE COPPER

01:50:48.708 --> 01:50:50.210
LINES. THEY WILL NOT LAST

01:50:50.276 --> 01:50:51.644
FOREVER. IF YOU LOOK AT NEW

01:50:51.711 --> 01:50:53.613
JERSEY AND NEW JERSEY NEAR THE

01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:54.748
AIRPORT, THE COPPER LINES CAUGHT

01:50:54.814 --> 01:50:57.417
ON FIRE, WHICH DELAYED THE

01:50:57.484 --> 01:50:59.019
PLANES FOR ABOUT TWO HOURS. AND

01:50:59.085 --> 01:51:00.520
SO WHAT DID THEY DO? THEY'RE

01:51:00.587 --> 01:51:02.455
TALKING ABOUT PUTTING IN FIBER

01:51:02.522 --> 01:51:04.224
BECAUSE FIBER OPTICS IS WHAT'S

01:51:04.290 --> 01:51:06.292
HAPPENED. WHAT'S WHAT'S THE NEW

01:51:06.359 --> 01:51:08.628
THE NEW TECHNOLOGY AT THE TIME.

01:51:08.695 --> 01:51:11.164
AND WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:51:11.231 --> 01:51:12.332
WE WORKED WITH A COMPANY THAT

01:51:12.399 --> 01:51:13.833
WOULD WOULD INVEST IN

01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:15.001
CALIFORNIA, WOULD INVEST IN

01:51:15.068 --> 01:51:17.103
FIBER, WOULD UPGRADE OUR

01:51:17.170 --> 01:51:18.438
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM. AND

01:51:18.505 --> 01:51:21.374
WITH THAT, I ASK FOR YOUR AYE

01:51:21.441 --> 01:51:25.745
VOTE. OKAY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:51:25.812 --> 01:51:27.647
MCHENRY, YOUR BILL ENJOYS A DUE

01:51:27.714 --> 01:51:29.015
PASS RECOMMENDATION. WHEN THIS

01:51:29.082 --> 01:51:31.418
BILL PASSED THE CNC THE FIRST GO

01:51:31.484 --> 01:51:32.852
AROUND, I BELIEVE OUR COMMITTEE

01:51:32.919 --> 01:51:34.521
AMENDMENTS PUT THIS BILL ON THE

01:51:34.587 --> 01:51:36.523
RIGHT TRACK. WE REQUIRE PROCESS,

01:51:36.589 --> 01:51:39.059
WE INCLUDE A GUARDRAILS, AND WE

01:51:39.125 --> 01:51:40.360
ENSURED THAT THERE WOULD BE A

01:51:40.427 --> 01:51:41.828
COMMITMENT TO PUBLIC BENEFITS AS

01:51:41.895 --> 01:51:43.897
PART OF THE PROCESS. SINCE THEN,

01:51:43.963 --> 01:51:45.165
I KNOW YOU HAVE CONTINUED TO

01:51:45.231 --> 01:51:47.067
WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION AS YOU

01:51:47.133 --> 01:51:49.636
PROMISED YOU WOULD. AND WHILE I

01:51:49.702 --> 01:51:50.937
UNDERSTAND THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT

01:51:51.004 --> 01:51:52.038
CALIFORNIANS GETTING LEFT BEHIND

01:51:52.105 --> 01:51:53.540
IN THIS TRANSITION, I BELIEVE WE

01:51:53.606 --> 01:51:55.975
HAVE STRONG GUARDRAILS IN PLACE

01:51:56.042 --> 01:51:57.343
TO ENSURE THAT THIS DOES NOT

01:51:57.410 --> 01:52:01.548
HAPPEN. AND ALSO PROCEDURES IN

01:52:01.614 --> 01:52:02.882
THE HOPEFULLY THE CASE. WE WILL

01:52:02.949 --> 01:52:05.418
NEVER HAVE TO USE THAT. IT DOES.

01:52:05.485 --> 01:52:06.586
CALIFORNIANS WILL CONTINUE TO

01:52:06.653 --> 01:52:08.021
HAVE ACCESS TO MULTIPLE OPTIONS

01:52:08.088 --> 01:52:10.423
UNDER THIS BILL. SOME TELEPHONE

01:52:10.490 --> 01:52:12.192
CORPORATIONS MAY GET RELIEF OF

01:52:12.258 --> 01:52:14.494
THEIR OBLIGATIONS AND THE PUBLIC

01:52:14.561 --> 01:52:17.230
WILL BENEFIT MOVING FORWARD. I

01:52:17.297 --> 01:52:18.832
KNOW YOU'RE ALSO COMMITTED TO

01:52:18.898 --> 01:52:20.867
WORKING WITH OUR FRIENDS IN THE

01:52:20.934 --> 01:52:22.402
LABOR MOVEMENT. I KNOW THAT THEY

01:52:22.469 --> 01:52:23.136
REMAINED OPPOSED RIGHT NOW, BUT

01:52:23.203 --> 01:52:25.538
I ENCOURAGE THAT THEY ARE NOW,

01:52:25.605 --> 01:52:26.906
AND I AM ENCOURAGED THAT THEY'LL

01:52:26.973 --> 01:52:28.475
NOW BE COMING TO THE THAT THEY

01:52:28.541 --> 01:52:30.143
WILL NOW COME TO THE TABLE,

01:52:30.210 --> 01:52:32.112
HOPEFULLY WITH SUGGESTIONS THAT

01:52:32.178 --> 01:52:33.680
I BELIEVE CAN ONLY MAKE THIS

01:52:33.746 --> 01:52:35.348
BILL MORE ROBUST AND ENSURING

01:52:35.415 --> 01:52:37.684
THAT JUST TRANSITION. WHAT I'VE

01:52:37.750 --> 01:52:39.252
SAID BEFORE IS THAT THIS

01:52:39.319 --> 01:52:40.653
TRANSITION AWAY FROM COPPER

01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:42.489
NETWORKS TO ADVANCE

01:52:42.555 --> 01:52:43.189
TELECOMMUNICATIONS

01:52:43.256 --> 01:52:44.457
INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT HAPPENING

01:52:44.524 --> 01:52:46.860
BECAUSE OF THIS BILL. IT'S

01:52:46.926 --> 01:52:49.796
HAPPENING DESPITE THIS BILL.

01:52:49.863 --> 01:52:50.396
HOWEVER, IF WE WANT TO ENSURE

01:52:50.463 --> 01:52:52.098
THE PUBLIC AND WORKERS BENEFIT,

01:52:52.165 --> 01:52:53.867
I CONTINUE TO BELIEVE

01:52:53.933 --> 01:52:55.802
LEGISLATION IS NECESSARY TO

01:52:55.869 --> 01:52:57.570
ENSURE THAT WE REACH THAT GOAL.

01:52:57.637 --> 01:53:00.406
THIS BILL CAN BE A WIN WIN FOR

01:53:00.473 --> 01:53:01.841
ALL PARTIES, AND I AM CONFIDENT

01:53:01.908 --> 01:53:03.877
THAT THERE'S A PATH FORWARD TO

01:53:03.943 --> 01:53:05.411
THAT END. WITH THAT, I'M

01:53:05.478 --> 01:53:07.413
RECOMMENDING AN AYE VOTE AND WE

01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:09.849
HAVE A MOTION MEMBERS. THERE'S

01:53:09.916 --> 01:53:11.484
BEEN A MOTION AND A SECOND, THE

01:53:11.551 --> 01:53:13.553
MOTION ON AB 470 BY ASSEMBLY

THIS CONCLUDES THE WORK OF THE

01:53:56.829 --> 01:53:57.597
ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON

01:53:57.664 --> 01:53:59.566
