00:54:40.644 --> 00:54:42.779

00:54:50.453 --> 00:54:52.222
CONFIDENTIAL. THIS SUBMITTER

00:54:52.288 --> 00:54:54.290
ALSO INCLUDES A CONFIDENTIALITY

00:54:54.357 --> 00:54:55.792
DECLARATION THAT DESCRIBES THE

00:54:55.859 --> 00:54:58.228
LEGAL BASIS FOR NON-DISCLOSURE,

00:54:58.294 --> 00:54:59.729
FOR EXAMPLE ON TRADE SECRET OR

00:54:59.796 --> 00:55:01.865
PRIVACY GROUNDS. IF THE

00:55:01.931 --> 00:55:02.932
COMMISSION'S PROCEDURES HAVE

00:55:02.999 --> 00:55:04.768
BEEN PROPERLY FOLLOWED, THAT

00:55:04.834 --> 00:55:06.202
INFORMATION IS PRELIMINARILY

00:55:06.269 --> 00:55:08.672
TREATED AS CONFIDENTIAL. WHEN

00:55:08.738 --> 00:55:10.106
INFORMATION IS REQUESTED, SUCH

00:55:10.173 --> 00:55:12.342
AS THROUGH A PUBLIC RECORDS ACT

00:55:12.409 --> 00:55:13.743
REQUEST, THE COMMISSION'S LEGAL

00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:14.944

00:55:15.011 --> 00:55:17.380
SUBSTANCE OF THE CLAIMS

00:55:17.447 --> 00:55:19.049
INFORMATION DETERMINED TO HAVE A

00:55:19.115 --> 00:55:20.583
LAWFUL BASIS OF CONFIDENTIALITY

00:55:20.650 --> 00:55:22.719
WILL NOT BE RELEASED. IF THE

00:55:22.786 --> 00:55:24.921
LEGAL ANALYSIS DETERMINES

00:55:24.988 --> 00:55:26.356
CONFIDENTIALITY, CLAIMS ARE NOT

00:55:26.423 --> 00:55:27.590
VALID AND THE INFORMATION SHOULD

00:55:27.657 --> 00:55:29.626
BE RELEASED, THE COMMISSION WILL

00:55:29.693 --> 00:55:30.960
ADDRESS THE CLAIMS VIA A

00:55:31.027 --> 00:55:33.196
RESOLUTION OR OTHER COMMISSION

00:55:33.263 --> 00:55:36.566
ORDER PRIOR TO DISCLOSURE. NEXT

00:55:36.633 --> 00:55:40.336
SLIDE PLEASE. THE COMMISSION HAS

00:55:40.403 --> 00:55:41.738
ISSUED SEVERAL DECISIONS

00:55:41.805 --> 00:55:43.139
RELATING TO THE CONFIDENTIALITY

00:55:43.206 --> 00:55:45.842
OF THE TNC DATA, FINDING THAT

00:55:45.909 --> 00:55:47.944
MOST TNC DATA SHOULD BE

00:55:48.011 --> 00:55:49.879
DISCLOSED. OVER THE PAST FIVE

00:55:49.946 --> 00:55:51.181
YEARS, THESE DECISIONS HAVE

00:55:51.247 --> 00:55:52.682
ELIMINATED AUTOMATIC

00:55:52.749 --> 00:55:53.683
CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT OF TNC

DATA AND ADDRESSED REHEARING

00:55:55.618 --> 00:55:57.987
APPLICATIONS FROM THE TNCS,

00:55:58.054 --> 00:55:59.789
AFFIRMING MOST DATA SHOULD BE

00:55:59.856 --> 00:56:00.957
DISCLOSED AND IN SOME CASES,

00:56:01.024 --> 00:56:03.026
AGGREGATED BEFORE DISCLOSURE.

00:56:03.093 --> 00:56:05.261
THIS REPRESENTS A SHIFT TOWARD

00:56:05.328 --> 00:56:06.930
PUBLIC ACCESS TO DATA, WHICH IS

00:56:06.996 --> 00:56:08.765
ON PAR WITH SEVERAL OTHER

00:56:08.832 --> 00:56:10.567
JURISDICTIONS THAT USE DATA.

00:56:10.633 --> 00:56:13.002
DATA REPORTING IS A KEY PART OF

00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:13.770
THEIR REGULATORY OVERSIGHT

00:56:13.837 --> 00:56:20.744

00:56:22.312 --> 00:56:24.447
I'D LIKE TO BRIEFLY TAKE A STEP

BACK FROM THE DATA REPORTING TO

00:56:26.249 --> 00:56:27.150
HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE

00:56:27.217 --> 00:56:28.318
COMMISSION'S RECENT WORK TO

00:56:28.384 --> 00:56:30.487
ADVANCE PASSENGER SAFETY IN TNC

00:56:32.122 --> 00:56:34.023
ACTIVITY HAS ADDRESSED TWO

00:56:34.090 --> 00:56:36.226
IMPORTANT SAFETY ISSUES THE

00:56:36.292 --> 00:56:37.560

MINORS. THIS SUPPORTS SAFER

00:56:58.982 --> 00:57:00.717
TRANSPORTATION FOR MINORS IN

00:57:00.784 --> 00:57:02.185

ALL TNCS IN THE STATE. ANNUAL

00:57:07.924 --> 00:57:09.659
COMMISSION STAFF TO MONITOR

00:57:09.726 --> 00:57:10.794

00:57:15.498 --> 00:57:16.866
ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS TO

00:57:22.639 --> 00:57:24.140
ROBUST REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

CONSISTENT WITH OUR REGULATORY

00:57:35.185 --> 00:57:36.419
MISSION AND AUTHORITY AFFIRMED

00:57:36.486 --> 00:57:39.589
BY THE LEGISLATURE IN 2014, WE

00:57:39.656 --> 00:57:41.324
CONTINUE TO MONITOR TNC SERVICE

00:57:41.391 --> 00:57:43.259
AND ENGAGE WITH THE INDUSTRY TO

00:57:43.326 --> 00:57:46.462
ADDRESS EMERGING ISSUES AS THEY

00:57:46.529 --> 00:57:49.365
ARISE. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THANK

00:57:49.432 --> 00:57:51.167

BRIEF YOU THIS AFTERNOON, AND WE

00:57:55.104 --> 00:57:56.306
LOOK FORWARD TO HELPING ANSWER

ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. THANK

00:57:58.408 --> 00:57:59.676
YOU. AND I WANT TO RECOGNIZE

00:57:59.742 --> 00:58:00.743
THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER MIA BONTA

00:58:00.810 --> 00:58:03.346
HAS JOINED US. I WOULD LIKE TO

00:58:03.413 --> 00:58:04.747
OPEN UP TO MY COMMITTEE MEMBERS

00:58:04.814 --> 00:58:06.783
FOR ANY QUESTIONS BEFORE I

00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:11.554
LAUNCH INTO A SERIES OF MONNING.

00:58:11.621 --> 00:58:13.256
ASSEMBLYMEMBER ROGERS, I'D BE

00:58:13.323 --> 00:58:15.058
DISAPPOINTED IF YOU DIDN'T RAISE

00:58:15.124 --> 00:58:16.559
YOUR HAND. FIRST OF ALL, THANKS

00:58:16.626 --> 00:58:20.296
FOR THE PRESENTATION. YOU KIND

00:58:20.363 --> 00:58:22.665
OF YOU TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

00:58:22.732 --> 00:58:24.067
HOW WE GOT TO THE REGULATORY

00:58:24.133 --> 00:58:25.468
ASPECT THAT WE'RE AT IN THE

00:58:25.535 --> 00:58:26.402
ENABLING STATUTE. DOES IT

00:58:26.469 --> 00:58:27.770
SPECIFY WHICH DATA YOU'RE ABLE

00:58:27.837 --> 00:58:29.606
TO COLLECT OR DID THAT COME FROM

00:58:29.672 --> 00:58:31.074
RULEMAKING, AND CAN IT BE

00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:33.009
CHANGED VIA RULEMAKING SHOULD

00:58:33.076 --> 00:58:36.479
YOU SEE A NEED. SO THE

00:58:36.546 --> 00:58:37.847
REQUIREMENTS FOR PUBLIC

00:58:37.914 --> 00:58:39.682
DISCLOSURE OF DATA IS NOT

00:58:39.749 --> 00:58:43.186
SPECIFIC TO TNCS ALL ALL

00:58:43.253 --> 00:58:45.421
REQUESTS FOR CONFIDENTIAL DATA

00:58:45.488 --> 00:58:47.523
TREATMENT GOES THROUGH OUR

00:58:47.590 --> 00:58:49.325
REGULATORY PROCESS OF GENERAL

00:58:49.392 --> 00:58:52.262
ORDER 66. SO REGARDLESS OF THE

00:58:52.328 --> 00:58:54.397
INDUSTRY THAT IT IS RELATED TO.

00:58:54.464 --> 00:58:57.333
SO SHORT ANSWER TO THE QUESTION

00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:59.469
IS THAT IT WAS NOT SET OUT IN

00:58:59.535 --> 00:59:03.206
THE 2014 STATUTE. AND OUR RULES

00:59:03.273 --> 00:59:06.342
ARE PURSUANT TO BOTH STATUTE

00:59:06.409 --> 00:59:08.778
THAT GOVERNS THE TREATMENT OF

00:59:08.845 --> 00:59:11.981
DATA AT THE COMMISSION, AS WELL

00:59:12.048 --> 00:59:13.883
AS THE CPRA. SO KIND OF BROADLY

00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:14.984
SPEAKING, THEN, DO YOU FEEL LIKE

00:59:15.051 --> 00:59:17.220
YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY YOU NEED

00:59:17.287 --> 00:59:18.588
TO PROPERLY REGULATE THE

00:59:18.655 --> 00:59:24.327
INDUSTRY? WE HAVE? WELL, I THINK

00:59:24.394 --> 00:59:26.462
THE AUTHORITY THAT WE HAVE IS

00:59:26.529 --> 00:59:30.233
THE AUTHORITY THAT WE USE TO DO

00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:32.702
THE REGULATIONS. IT'S AT A STAFF

00:59:32.769 --> 00:59:34.203
AT THE COMMISSION. IT'S REALLY

00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:35.738
KIND OF NOT OUR ROLE TO

00:59:35.805 --> 00:59:37.040
DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT

00:59:37.106 --> 00:59:38.041
SOMETHING IS OR IS NOT

00:59:38.107 --> 00:59:39.309
APPROPRIATE. WE KIND OF LOOK AT

00:59:39.375 --> 00:59:41.311
THE RULES AS THEY ARE, AND

00:59:41.377 --> 00:59:43.046
THAT'S WHAT WE DO WITH IT. SO

00:59:43.112 --> 00:59:45.782
YOU ONE OF THE DATA POINTS THAT

00:59:45.848 --> 00:59:47.050
YOU GET ARE COMPLAINTS THAT COME

00:59:47.116 --> 00:59:50.086
IN FROM FOLKS. WHAT CURRENTLY

00:59:50.153 --> 00:59:51.688
KIND OF IN THE LAST COUPLE OF

00:59:51.754 --> 00:59:54.891
YEARS, DOES THAT DATA TREND LOOK

00:59:54.958 --> 00:59:55.692
LIKE THAT? MOST OF THE

00:59:55.758 --> 00:59:59.662
COMPLAINTS ARE GEARED TOWARDS? I

00:59:59.729 --> 01:00:02.465
DON'T HAVE A ANSWER AS TO THE

01:00:02.532 --> 01:00:03.499
SPECIFIC COMPLAINTS, JUST

01:00:03.566 --> 01:00:05.368
BECAUSE COMPLAINTS COME IN FROM

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:07.403
A LOT OF DIFFERENT CHANNELS. SO

01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:09.272
IF THEY COME IN THROUGH THE

01:00:09.339 --> 01:00:12.275
ANNUAL REPORT, THEN THOSE

01:00:12.342 --> 01:00:14.043
COMPLAINTS ARE SORT OF DELAYED

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:15.979
IN TERMS OF HOW THEY'RE REPORTED

01:00:16.045 --> 01:00:17.280
TO US. RIGHT. WE GET IT IN

01:00:17.347 --> 01:00:19.816
JANUARY OF THE NEXT YEAR, BUT WE

01:00:19.882 --> 01:00:22.618
ALSO GET COMPLAINTS DIRECTLY

01:00:22.685 --> 01:00:24.654
FROM WE HAVE A COMPLAINT PAGE

01:00:24.721 --> 01:00:26.689
WHERE PEOPLE SUBMIT COMPLAINTS

01:00:26.756 --> 01:00:29.525
OR FILE INFORMAL COMPLAINTS WHEN

01:00:29.592 --> 01:00:31.327
THOSE INFORMAL COMPLAINTS COME

01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:34.497
IN, EVERY SINGLE COMPLAINT IS

01:00:34.564 --> 01:00:37.100
ASSIGNED TO AN ANALYST IN OUR

01:00:37.166 --> 01:00:37.734
TRANSPORTATION ENFORCEMENT

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.969
BRANCH, AND THEY CONTACT THE

01:00:40.036 --> 01:00:42.739
COMPLAINANT. THEY FIND OUT WHAT

01:00:42.805 --> 01:00:43.840
HAPPENED, TNCS OR OTHERWISE.

01:00:43.906 --> 01:00:46.476
REALLY EVERY TRANSPORTATION

01:00:46.542 --> 01:00:48.478
SERVICE THAT IS UNDER OUR

01:00:48.544 --> 01:00:52.882
REGULATION AND THERE ARE MANY

01:00:52.949 --> 01:00:55.318
RESOLUTION PATHS. SOMETIMES WE

01:00:55.385 --> 01:00:59.722
CONTACT THE TNCS OR NOT. ALL

01:00:59.789 --> 01:01:01.090
COMPLAINANTS ACTUALLY WILL

01:01:01.157 --> 01:01:04.127
RESPOND WHEN THEY ARE CONTACTED,

01:01:04.193 --> 01:01:05.895
AND THERE ARE SOME TIMES WHEN

01:01:05.962 --> 01:01:07.697
THE COMPLAINT NEEDS TO BE

01:01:07.764 --> 01:01:09.399
REFERRED TO OUTSIDE LAW

01:01:09.465 --> 01:01:11.868
ENFORCEMENT OR OTHER AGENCIES.

01:01:11.934 --> 01:01:13.403
THAT'S REALLY HELPFUL BECAUSE I

01:01:13.469 --> 01:01:16.873
THINK EVEN TAKING A STEP BACK,

01:01:16.939 --> 01:01:18.474
YOU COLLECT THE DATA, YOU YOU

01:01:18.541 --> 01:01:20.043
HAVE THE DATA THAT'S PROVIDED

01:01:20.109 --> 01:01:21.944
FOR YOU. HOW DO YOU USE THAT

01:01:22.011 --> 01:01:24.881
DATA? I THINK JUST SORT OF AT A

01:01:24.947 --> 01:01:28.084
MACRO LEVEL. OKAY, I CAN START

01:01:28.151 --> 01:01:31.087
AND THEN TARA WILL BE THE

01:01:31.154 --> 01:01:32.889
SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT ON SORT OF

01:01:32.955 --> 01:01:35.792
SPECIFIC USES ON THESE, BUT FOR

01:01:35.858 --> 01:01:36.826
EXAMPLE, ON THE COMPLAINT DATA,

01:01:36.893 --> 01:01:39.562
WE DO DO AN EVALUATION OF

01:01:39.629 --> 01:01:41.230
TRENDS. I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE

01:01:41.297 --> 01:01:43.299
THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE, BUT

01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:46.035
WE HAVE USED THAT INFORMATION TO

01:01:46.102 --> 01:01:50.873
INFORM. FOR EXAMPLE, RECENTLY WE

01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:52.642
SELECTED THE OKAY, WE HAVE

01:01:52.708 --> 01:01:54.410
SELECTED THE OKAY. WE HAVE

01:01:54.477 --> 01:01:55.745
RECENTLY SELECTED A CONTRACTOR

01:01:55.812 --> 01:01:59.449
WHO WILL HELP US IMPLEMENT THE

01:01:59.515 --> 01:02:01.984
DEVELOPING A TAXONOMY FOR SEXUAL

01:02:02.051 --> 01:02:03.786
ASSAULT THAT OCCURS AND

01:02:03.853 --> 01:02:05.254
COMPLAINTS OF ASSAULT THAT

01:02:05.321 --> 01:02:08.191
HAPPENS ON THE PLATFORM. SO PART

01:02:08.257 --> 01:02:10.293
OF THAT REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND

01:02:10.359 --> 01:02:13.162
IN OUR EVALUATION OF THE BIDDERS

01:02:13.229 --> 01:02:14.297
WAS INFORMED BY THE COMPLAINTS

01:02:14.363 --> 01:02:17.567
THAT HAVE COME IN AS PART OF THE

01:02:17.633 --> 01:02:20.236
ANNUAL REPORTS. YEAH. AND I

01:02:20.303 --> 01:02:22.805
WOULD JUST ADD TO THAT TO, I

01:02:22.872 --> 01:02:24.173
THINK, CATEGORIZE THE WAY WE USE

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.342
THE DATA INTO MAYBE THREE MAIN

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:29.645
TYPES OF USES. AND ACCORDING TO

01:02:29.712 --> 01:02:30.780
KIND OF OUR CORE

01:02:30.847 --> 01:02:32.482
RESPONSIBILITIES. SO ONE OF THE

01:02:32.548 --> 01:02:33.249
CORE RESPONSIBILITIES WE HAVE

01:02:33.316 --> 01:02:34.217
WITH STAFF IS TO ADVISE THE

01:02:34.283 --> 01:02:36.519
COMMISSION ON POLICY MAKING. AS

01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:39.021
YOU KNOW, THERE'S A CURRENTLY

01:02:39.088 --> 01:02:41.057
OPEN RULEMAKING PROCEEDING

01:02:41.124 --> 01:02:43.092
RELATING TO TNCS. AND SO ONE OF

01:02:43.159 --> 01:02:45.094
THE USES IS TO PROVIDE DATA

01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:46.662
DRIVEN ADVICE TO OUR

01:02:46.729 --> 01:02:48.164
COMMISSIONERS IN SETTING POLICY

01:02:48.231 --> 01:02:50.199
AND SPOTTING ISSUES THAT THEY

01:02:50.266 --> 01:02:53.069
MAY WANT TO ADDRESS. THE SECOND

01:02:53.136 --> 01:02:55.304
PIECE IS RELATED TO OUR PROGRAM

01:02:55.371 --> 01:02:57.807
IMPLEMENTATION. AND SO THE TWO

01:02:57.874 --> 01:02:59.942
KEY EXAMPLES THERE ARE

01:03:00.009 --> 01:03:02.812
IMPLEMENTING THE CLEAN MILE

01:03:02.879 --> 01:03:04.147
STANDARD AND ACCESS FOR ALL

01:03:04.213 --> 01:03:06.115
PROGRAMS ESTABLISHED BY THE

01:03:06.182 --> 01:03:09.519
LEGISLATURE. AND THOSE ANNUAL

01:03:09.585 --> 01:03:11.387
REPORT DATA HAVE BEEN REALLY

01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:13.890
CRITICAL TO PROVIDING A SOLID

01:03:13.956 --> 01:03:15.024
GROUNDING FOR THE POLICY

01:03:15.091 --> 01:03:16.792
DECISIONS IN THOSE PROGRAMS. AND

01:03:16.859 --> 01:03:20.029
THEN LASTLY, THE REPORTING

01:03:20.096 --> 01:03:21.898
PROVIDES A COMPONENT OF OUR

01:03:21.964 --> 01:03:24.734
COMPLIANCE OVERSIGHT. AND SO

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:27.203
THERE ARE BASELINE RULES THAT

01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:28.738
TNCS AND ALL OF OUR PASSENGER

01:03:28.804 --> 01:03:29.739
PASSENGER TRANSPORTATION

01:03:29.805 --> 01:03:31.941
CARRIERS HAVE TO FOLLOW. AND SO

01:03:32.008 --> 01:03:33.342
ANALYSIS OF THIS DATA CAN

01:03:33.409 --> 01:03:35.244
PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO COMPLIANCE

01:03:35.311 --> 01:03:36.646
WITH SOME OF THOSE RULES AS

01:03:36.712 --> 01:03:39.148
WELL. SO IN GENERAL, DO YOU FEEL

01:03:39.215 --> 01:03:42.251
LIKE THE TNC COMPANIES LARGELY

01:03:42.318 --> 01:03:45.288
PROVIDE THE DATA THAT YOU

01:03:45.354 --> 01:03:47.356
REQUEST? AND IS THERE ANY

01:03:47.423 --> 01:03:48.891
ADDITIONAL DATA THAT WOULD BE

01:03:48.958 --> 01:03:51.127
HELPFUL FOR YOU IN THAT END THAT

01:03:51.194 --> 01:03:53.563
YOU ARE NOT CURRENTLY ABLE TO

01:03:53.629 --> 01:03:56.098
CAPTURE, OR THAT HASN'T BEEN

01:03:56.165 --> 01:03:57.333
CONTEMPLATED THROUGH RULEMAKING

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:59.669
OR STATUTE? YEAH, I WOULD SAY BY

01:03:59.735 --> 01:04:01.504
AND LARGE, WE ARE ABLE TO GET

01:04:01.571 --> 01:04:03.406
THE DATA THAT WE NEED, AND THE

01:04:03.472 --> 01:04:04.840
TNCS HAVE BEEN RESPONSIVE BOTH

01:04:04.907 --> 01:04:06.676
TO THE REQUIREMENTS AND TO DATA

01:04:06.742 --> 01:04:09.645
REQUESTS THAT WE ISSUE. THERE

01:04:09.712 --> 01:04:11.747
ARE SOME ISSUES THAT COME UP

01:04:11.814 --> 01:04:13.749
JUST IN TERMS OF OPERATIONAL

01:04:13.816 --> 01:04:15.985
CONSTRAINT AND BEING ABLE TO FOR

01:04:16.052 --> 01:04:17.620
THE TNCS TO PROVIDE DATA, BUT I

01:04:17.687 --> 01:04:19.422
THINK THEY SHOULD SPEAK DIRECTLY

01:04:19.488 --> 01:04:22.391
TO THAT. BUT OVERALL, I THINK WE

01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:24.360
HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO REQUEST

01:04:24.427 --> 01:04:26.295
DATA THAT WE NEED AND HAVE BEEN

01:04:26.362 --> 01:04:29.098
USING IT EFFECTIVELY. GREAT.

01:04:29.165 --> 01:04:31.767
THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU.

01:04:31.834 --> 01:04:37.406
ANYBODY ELSE? OKAY. SO I'M VERY

01:04:37.473 --> 01:04:40.610
INTERESTED TO KNOW HOW TNC

01:04:40.676 --> 01:04:43.179
SORRY, HOW TNCS AFFECT OUR

01:04:43.246 --> 01:04:44.647
CLIMATE AND EMISSIONS. CAN YOU

01:04:44.714 --> 01:04:46.549
SPEAK IN A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:04:46.616 --> 01:04:47.850
DETAIL ABOUT HOW THE CLEAN MILE

01:04:47.917 --> 01:04:49.619
STANDARD PROGRAM IS REDUCING

01:04:49.685 --> 01:04:51.387
EMISSIONS IN THE SECTOR, AND

01:04:51.454 --> 01:04:53.889
WHAT THE SPECIFIC GOALS OF THE

01:04:53.956 --> 01:04:57.226
PROGRAM ARE? ABSOLUTELY. YEAH.

01:04:57.293 --> 01:04:59.428
YES. SENATOR SKINNER AUTHORED

01:04:59.495 --> 01:05:01.063
LEGISLATION IN 2018 TO ESTABLISH

01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:03.733
THIS PROGRAM, AND THAT STATUTE

01:05:03.799 --> 01:05:05.401
DIRECTED THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD

01:05:05.468 --> 01:05:07.336
TO WORK TOGETHER WITH THE CPUC

01:05:07.403 --> 01:05:09.772
IN IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAM.

01:05:09.839 --> 01:05:12.275
SPECIFICALLY, IT TASKED THE AIR

01:05:12.341 --> 01:05:13.809
RESOURCES BOARD WITH

01:05:13.876 --> 01:05:15.945
ESTABLISHING TARGETS FOR THE

01:05:16.012 --> 01:05:18.414
EMISSIONS REDUCTION IN TNC

01:05:18.481 --> 01:05:21.384
FLEETS AND FOR THE CPUC TO

01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:23.586
IMPLEMENT THOSE TARGETS. SINCE

01:05:23.653 --> 01:05:25.588
THAT TIME, CARB HAS ESTABLISHED

01:05:25.655 --> 01:05:28.591
TARGETS WHICH RELATE TO

01:05:28.658 --> 01:05:29.925
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS PER

01:05:29.992 --> 01:05:31.827
PASSENGER MILE, WITH A TARGET TO

01:05:31.894 --> 01:05:37.166
REDUCE THAT TO ZERO BY 2030 AND

01:05:37.233 --> 01:05:39.735
TO INCREASE THE FRACTION OF

01:05:39.802 --> 01:05:41.170
VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED IN THESE

01:05:41.237 --> 01:05:43.306
FLEETS PROVIDED BY ZERO EMISSION

01:05:43.372 --> 01:05:46.208
VEHICLES TO 90% BY 2030. SO

01:05:46.275 --> 01:05:47.743
THOSE ARE THE UNDERLYING

01:05:47.810 --> 01:05:49.845
TARGETS. AND OUR WORK TO

01:05:49.912 --> 01:05:51.147
IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM IS

01:05:51.213 --> 01:05:53.716
ONGOING. WE HAVE OPEN RULEMAKING

01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:56.919
CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS. WE HAVE

01:05:56.986 --> 01:05:59.188
ALSO ESTABLISHED WHAT WE CALL A

01:05:59.255 --> 01:06:00.756
DRIVER'S ASSISTANCE PROGRAM THAT

01:06:00.823 --> 01:06:03.059
IS GOING TO PROVIDE INCENTIVES

01:06:03.125 --> 01:06:04.493
TO LOW AND MODERATE INCOME

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:06.362
DRIVERS TO HELP THEM TRANSITION

01:06:06.429 --> 01:06:10.666
THEIR PERSONALLY OWNED VEHICLES

01:06:10.733 --> 01:06:11.300
TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES USED

01:06:11.367 --> 01:06:14.270
IN THE TNC FLEETS. AND CAN WE

01:06:14.337 --> 01:06:15.237
EXPECT THAT THE CPUC WILL

01:06:15.304 --> 01:06:17.640
PUBLISH AN ANALYSIS OR REPORT TO

01:06:17.707 --> 01:06:19.642
EVALUATE THE PROGRAM? AND WHICH

01:06:19.709 --> 01:06:20.976
ENTITIES ARE YOU PARTNERING WITH

01:06:21.043 --> 01:06:22.878
TO COMPLETE THOSE REPORTS? YES,

01:06:22.945 --> 01:06:23.913
ABSOLUTELY. THERE'S A COUPLE OF

01:06:23.979 --> 01:06:25.548
KEY COMPONENTS IN THE PROGRAM

01:06:25.614 --> 01:06:27.083
THAT WILL PROVIDE AN ANALYSIS

01:06:27.149 --> 01:06:31.087
AND EVALUATION. FIRSTLY, THE

01:06:31.153 --> 01:06:33.989
STATUTE CALLS FOR A BIENNIAL

01:06:34.056 --> 01:06:35.424
UNANTICIPATED BARRIERS REPORT,

01:06:35.491 --> 01:06:36.692
WHICH IS LOOKING AT MARKET

01:06:36.759 --> 01:06:38.027
FORCES THAT MAY HAVE CHANGED

01:06:38.094 --> 01:06:39.495
SINCE THAT TIME THAT AFFECT THE

01:06:39.562 --> 01:06:41.163
ABILITY TO MEET THE ORIGINAL

01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:45.234
TARGETS. AND SO THAT IS, I

01:06:45.301 --> 01:06:47.737
BELIEVE, TO BE PUBLISHED IN

01:06:47.803 --> 01:06:50.906
2026. AND SECONDARILY, THE

01:06:50.973 --> 01:06:53.042
COMMISSION HAS HIRED A

01:06:53.109 --> 01:06:55.578
CONTRACTOR. THE NAME OF THE FIRM

01:06:55.644 --> 01:06:58.581
ESCAPES ME, BUT THEY WILL BE AN

01:06:58.647 --> 01:06:59.982
EVALUATOR OF THIS DRIVER'S

01:07:00.049 --> 01:07:01.484
ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AND WILL BE

01:07:01.550 --> 01:07:03.686
ABLE TO PROVIDE AN ANALYSIS OF

01:07:03.753 --> 01:07:05.054
THE EFFECT AND THE IMPACT THAT

01:07:05.121 --> 01:07:09.024
THAT HAS, THAT HAS HAD ON THE

01:07:09.091 --> 01:07:11.460
SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM. AND

01:07:11.527 --> 01:07:13.262
MOVING ON TO THE ACCESS FOR ALL

01:07:13.329 --> 01:07:15.097
PROGRAM. THIS COMMITTEE IS

01:07:15.164 --> 01:07:16.966
ADVANCING A BILL, AB 1532, THAT

01:07:17.032 --> 01:07:18.701
WOULD EXTEND THE ACCESS FOR ALL

01:07:18.768 --> 01:07:20.102
PROGRAM, WHICH HAS BEEN

01:07:20.169 --> 01:07:21.904
SUCCESSFUL IN EXPANDING ACCESS

01:07:21.971 --> 01:07:24.407
TO TNC SERVICES TO DISABLED

01:07:24.473 --> 01:07:25.474
CALIFORNIANS. CAN YOU SAY MORE

01:07:25.541 --> 01:07:27.543
ABOUT HOW THIS PROGRAM IS

01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:28.744
HELPING DISABLED CALIFORNIANS

01:07:28.811 --> 01:07:30.546
ACROSS THE STATE AND

01:07:30.613 --> 01:07:33.082
SPECIFICALLY IN RURAL COUNTIES?

01:07:33.149 --> 01:07:34.617
YES, ABSOLUTELY. THANKS FOR

01:07:34.683 --> 01:07:37.086
CALLING ATTENTION TO THAT, BILL.

01:07:37.153 --> 01:07:38.821
WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THIS

01:07:38.888 --> 01:07:40.756
PROGRAM SO FAR TO DATE, SINCE

01:07:40.823 --> 01:07:42.558
ITS IMPLEMENTATION BEGAN IN

01:07:42.625 --> 01:07:45.661
2019, OVER 300,000 ON DEMAND

01:07:45.728 --> 01:07:47.496
WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE TRIPS HAVE

01:07:47.563 --> 01:07:51.467
BEEN PROVIDED TO CALIFORNIANS,

01:07:51.534 --> 01:07:56.839
AND ABOUT 63,000 TRIPS PROVIDED

01:07:56.906 --> 01:07:59.008
THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL,

01:07:59.074 --> 01:08:00.409
WHAT WE CALL LOCAL ACCESS

01:08:00.476 --> 01:08:03.679
PROVIDERS NON TNCS. THESE ARE

01:08:03.746 --> 01:08:05.514
LOCAL TRANSPORTATION

01:08:05.581 --> 01:08:06.048
ORGANIZATIONS THAT RECEIVE

01:08:06.115 --> 01:08:09.718
FUNDING THROUGH THE PROGRAM, AND

01:08:09.785 --> 01:08:11.554
WHILE THOSE PROGRAMS CURRENTLY

01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:14.123
ARE MOSTLY FOCUSED ON URBAN AND

01:08:14.190 --> 01:08:15.491
SUBURBAN AREAS OF CALIFORNIA,

01:08:15.558 --> 01:08:17.793
WE'VE ALSO RECENTLY CONTRACTED

01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:19.862
WITH WHAT WE CALL A STATEWIDE

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:21.664
ACCESS FUND ADMINISTRATOR THAT

01:08:21.730 --> 01:08:24.467
WILL RECEIVE ANY FUNDS LEFT OVER

01:08:24.533 --> 01:08:27.436
FROM THE INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION

01:08:27.503 --> 01:08:30.039
TO PROVIDE PROGRAMS IN THE OTHER

01:08:30.105 --> 01:08:31.273
COUNTIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. I

01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:34.343
THINK IT'S 40, 40 OR SO OTHER

01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:37.613
COUNTIES, AND THAT POT OF MONEY

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:41.417
IS AROUND $17 MILLION. GREAT.

01:08:41.484 --> 01:08:43.319
THANK YOU FOR THAT. MOVING ON TO

01:08:43.385 --> 01:08:45.654
THE OTHER PART OF YOUR

01:08:45.721 --> 01:08:46.255
PRESENTATION AROUND DATA AND

01:08:46.322 --> 01:08:47.122
TRANSPARENCY. ALTHOUGH THE CPUC

01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:48.691
HAS MADE AN EFFORT TO ENSURE

01:08:48.757 --> 01:08:50.860
TRANSPARENCY OF TNC DATA, SOME

01:08:50.926 --> 01:08:52.161
OF THOSE DECISIONS CONTINUE TO

01:08:52.228 --> 01:08:54.029
BE CHALLENGED. IS IT CORRECT

01:08:54.096 --> 01:08:56.365
THAT THE ONLY DATA FROM THE YEAR

01:08:56.432 --> 01:08:59.134
2021 IS AVAILABLE, AND THAT EVEN

01:08:59.201 --> 01:09:01.971
THAT DATA IS HEAVILY REDACTED?

01:09:02.037 --> 01:09:05.307
YES, THAT IS TRUE. OKAY. AND CAN

01:09:05.374 --> 01:09:06.675
YOU SPEAK IN MORE DETAIL ABOUT

01:09:06.742 --> 01:09:08.444
HOW THE CPUC IS ADMINISTERING

01:09:08.511 --> 01:09:10.279
THE PROCESS TO EVALUATE HOW OR

01:09:10.346 --> 01:09:13.582
WHEN THE DATA COULD BE RELEASED?

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:14.650
FOR EXAMPLE, WHAT ARE THE STEPS

01:09:14.717 --> 01:09:16.018
BEING TAKEN AND WHAT STEPS

01:09:16.085 --> 01:09:18.487
REMAIN IF YOU CAN JUST WALK US

01:09:18.554 --> 01:09:19.255
THROUGH THAT PROCESS? SO THE

01:09:19.321 --> 01:09:21.490
COMMISSION ISSUED A DECISION,

01:09:21.557 --> 01:09:24.660
WHICH I THINK WAS IN 2024, WHICH

01:09:24.727 --> 01:09:26.495
SAID THAT TRIP DATA COULD BE

01:09:26.562 --> 01:09:29.064
RELEASED IF IT WERE AGGREGATED.

01:09:29.131 --> 01:09:31.567
THAT DECISION WAS THEN APPEALED

01:09:31.634 --> 01:09:32.535
THROUGH THE COMMISSION'S

01:09:32.601 --> 01:09:36.605
REHEARING PROCESS AND THE

01:09:36.672 --> 01:09:40.109
REHEARING DECISION FOUND IN PART

01:09:40.175 --> 01:09:42.611
FOR THE REHEARING ON MINOR

01:09:42.678 --> 01:09:44.813
POINTS AND THEN DIRECTED FOR THE

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:46.649
ISSUANCE OF A NEW DECISION THAT

01:09:46.715 --> 01:09:47.650
ADDRESSED SOME OF THOSE

01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:51.253
CONCERNS. AND SO, ACTUALLY, IN

01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:52.655
MAY 6TH, THE COMMISSION ISSUED

01:09:52.721 --> 01:09:54.523
ANOTHER DECISION IN RESPONSE TO

01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:57.393
THE REHEARING DECISION. WE'RE IN

01:09:57.459 --> 01:10:03.232
THE 30 DAY PERIOD OF COMMENTS

01:10:03.299 --> 01:10:07.870
FOR THE IMPACTED ENTITIES TO

01:10:07.937 --> 01:10:10.005
SUBMIT ANY ADDITIONAL APPEAL AND

01:10:10.072 --> 01:10:13.242
OR REHEARING. SO WE AND THAT

01:10:13.309 --> 01:10:15.444
DECISION ADDRESSES THE FIRST

01:10:15.511 --> 01:10:17.379
TRANCHE OF DATA WHICH RELATES TO

01:10:17.446 --> 01:10:22.685
THE 2014 TO 2019 PERIOD. AND

01:10:22.751 --> 01:10:25.487
THEN THERE ARE OTHER PENDING

01:10:25.554 --> 01:10:27.289
ACTIONS RELATED TO THE SECOND

01:10:27.356 --> 01:10:28.824
TRANCHE. AND THE REASON THAT

01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:30.926
THERE'S BEEN TRANCHES HAS TO DO

01:10:30.993 --> 01:10:33.829
WITH WHEN APPEALS WERE FILED.

01:10:33.896 --> 01:10:37.066
AND ALSO THERE WERE OTHER TIMES

01:10:37.132 --> 01:10:40.936
IN WHICH THE STAFF AT NCP

01:10:41.003 --> 01:10:43.038
CHANGED THE FORMAT AND SORT OF

01:10:43.105 --> 01:10:44.673
THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ON AN

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:47.142
ANNUAL BASIS. AS MORE

01:10:47.209 --> 01:10:48.911
INFORMATION BECAME AVAILABLE.

01:10:48.978 --> 01:10:53.582
SO, YES, WE ARE STILL IN ACTIVE

01:10:53.649 --> 01:10:56.218
ENGAGEMENT ON THOSE PROCESSES.

01:10:56.285 --> 01:10:58.654
AND THE GENERAL POLICY AT THE

01:10:58.721 --> 01:11:01.857
COMMISSION IS THAT WE FAVOR

01:11:01.924 --> 01:11:04.960
DISCLOSURE UNLESS THE INTEREST

01:11:05.027 --> 01:11:07.963
IN PRESERVING CONFIDENTIALITY

01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:11.734
OUTWEIGHS THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:12.401
GETTING ACCESS TO THAT

01:11:12.468 --> 01:11:15.604
INFORMATION. OKAY. AND SO

01:11:15.671 --> 01:11:16.939
ALTHOUGH THE CPUC HAS NOT BEEN

01:11:17.006 --> 01:11:19.274
ABLE TO PUBLISH THE DATA FOR THE

01:11:19.341 --> 01:11:20.943
PUBLIC, IT SEEMS LIKE MAYBE

01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:22.411
WE'RE GOING TO GET SOMETHING

01:11:22.478 --> 01:11:24.279
SOON, WHICH WOULD BE HOPEFULLY

01:11:24.346 --> 01:11:27.416
THAT'S HELPFUL. LET'S HOPE. HOW

01:11:27.483 --> 01:11:29.318
REGULARLY IS THE CPUC PUBLISHING

01:11:29.385 --> 01:11:31.387
ITS OWN DATA ANALYZES OR

01:11:31.453 --> 01:11:33.188
UTILIZING THE DATA INTERNALLY

01:11:33.255 --> 01:11:34.390
FOR REGULATORY PURPOSES? WE DO.

01:11:34.456 --> 01:11:36.091
WE USE IT ALL THE TIME, OKAY. WE

01:11:36.158 --> 01:11:38.527
USE IT REGULARLY ALL THE TIME.

01:11:38.594 --> 01:11:42.831
IT IS USED TO REALLY HAVE

01:11:42.898 --> 01:11:44.767
INFORMED ADVICE BEING MADE TO

01:11:44.833 --> 01:11:46.435
THE COMMISSIONERS AND TO THE

01:11:46.502 --> 01:11:49.171
JUDGES IN IN IDENTIFYING TRENDS

01:11:49.238 --> 01:11:51.540
AND IDENTIFYING ISSUES AND

01:11:51.607 --> 01:11:53.308
RECOMMENDING, YOU KNOW, FURTHER

01:11:53.375 --> 01:11:57.279
SCOPING OF WHAT UPCOMING OR

01:11:57.346 --> 01:11:59.782
CURRENT RULEMAKING LOOKS LIKE.

01:11:59.848 --> 01:12:02.051
SO WE DEFINITELY ARE USING IT

01:12:02.117 --> 01:12:04.520
INTERNALLY. OKAY. AND WHAT, IF

01:12:04.586 --> 01:12:05.988
ANYTHING, CAN WE EXPECT TO SEE

01:12:06.055 --> 01:12:09.558
RELATED TO DATA ISSUES, THE DATA

01:12:09.625 --> 01:12:11.226
ISSUE OVER THE NEXT SIX MONTHS.

01:12:11.293 --> 01:12:12.961
SO WHAT CAN THIS COMMITTEE

01:12:13.028 --> 01:12:14.930
EXPECT TO NOW MAYBE YEAH, IF

01:12:14.997 --> 01:12:17.866
YOU'RE IF YOU'RE FOLLOWING THE

01:12:17.933 --> 01:12:19.702
RULEMAKING DOCKET, YOU'LL SEE

01:12:19.768 --> 01:12:23.138
THAT THE LAST ORDER EXTENDING

01:12:23.205 --> 01:12:27.242
STATUTORY DEADLINE RUNS UNTIL

01:12:27.309 --> 01:12:29.712
SEPTEMBER, MEANING THAT THAT

01:12:29.778 --> 01:12:32.548
PROCEEDING NEEDS TO BE CLOSED BY

01:12:32.614 --> 01:12:34.817
SEPTEMBER OR ANOTHER ORDER OF

01:12:34.883 --> 01:12:36.485
EXTENSION HAS TO BE ISSUED. THE

01:12:36.552 --> 01:12:38.287
ONLY REMAINING ISSUE IN THAT

01:12:38.353 --> 01:12:39.121
PROCEEDING RIGHT NOW THAT IS

01:12:39.188 --> 01:12:40.889
OPEN AND ACTIVELY BEING ENGAGED

01:12:40.956 --> 01:12:42.658
ON IS THE DATA ISSUE. SO WE

01:12:42.725 --> 01:12:43.492
WOULD EXPECT FOR SOMETHING TO

01:12:43.559 --> 01:12:46.228
COME OUT BEFORE THEN. WHILE WE

01:12:46.295 --> 01:12:48.430
WAIT WITH BATED BREATH ON THIS

01:12:48.497 --> 01:12:50.332
COMMITTEE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS

01:12:50.399 --> 01:12:52.468
FROM MY COMMITTEE MEMBERS?

01:12:52.534 --> 01:12:54.002
ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROGERS YEAH,

01:12:54.069 --> 01:12:55.370
SORRY. JUST AS A QUICK FOLLOW

01:12:55.437 --> 01:12:57.639
UP, AND YOU MAY HAVE SAID IT,

01:12:57.706 --> 01:12:58.774
BUT FOR THE CLEAN MILES PROGRAM,

01:12:58.841 --> 01:13:00.943
HOW IS THAT GOING TO BE FUNDED?

01:13:01.009 --> 01:13:03.245
I CAN SPEAK TO THAT. THE INITIAL

01:13:03.312 --> 01:13:05.481
DECISION THAT CAME OUT IN THAT

01:13:05.547 --> 01:13:06.448
PROCEEDING ESTABLISHED A

01:13:06.515 --> 01:13:08.984
REGULATORY FEE SET AT $0.09 PER

01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:11.487
RIDE. SO AS A CUSTOMER OF A TNC

01:13:11.553 --> 01:13:12.654
IN CALIFORNIA, IF YOU TAKE A

01:13:12.721 --> 01:13:16.792
TRIP, YOU PAY $0.09 INTO THIS.

01:13:16.859 --> 01:13:19.027
YOU KNOW, POT OF MONEY THAT WILL

01:13:19.094 --> 01:13:22.064
BE USED TO FUND THESE INCENTIVES

01:13:22.131 --> 01:13:22.798
FOR LOW AND MODERATE INCOME

01:13:22.865 --> 01:13:25.434
DRIVERS. PERFECT. THANK YOU.

01:13:25.501 --> 01:13:27.803
ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARLOS. THANK

01:13:27.870 --> 01:13:29.805
YOU, CHAIR BERNER. THANK YOU

01:13:29.872 --> 01:13:31.673
BOTH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION.

01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:35.310
SUPER HELPFUL. JUST TO KIND OF

01:13:35.377 --> 01:13:36.979
ECHO OFF OF WHAT MY COLLEAGUES

01:13:37.045 --> 01:13:39.281
MENTIONED, YOU NAMED OFF A

01:13:39.348 --> 01:13:40.682
NUMBER OF BILLS FROM THE

01:13:40.749 --> 01:13:42.384
LEGISLATURE THAT WE'VE PASSED

01:13:42.451 --> 01:13:44.520
OVER A FEW YEARS. CAN YOU JUST

01:13:44.586 --> 01:13:48.190
KIND OF GO OVER, YOU KNOW, ANY

01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:49.525
CHALLENGES OR SUCCESSES THAT

01:13:49.591 --> 01:13:52.060
YOU'VE FOUND IN ANY OF THOSE

01:13:52.127 --> 01:13:53.929
LEGISLATIONS? ANYTHING THAT YOU

01:13:53.996 --> 01:13:55.564
FIND THAT WOULD BE WORTH SHARING

01:13:55.631 --> 01:13:57.966
WITH US AS WE HAVE, YOU KNOW,

01:13:58.033 --> 01:13:58.967
INFORMATIONAL HEARING? AND I

01:13:59.034 --> 01:14:00.102
THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT OUR

01:14:00.169 --> 01:14:02.137
CHAIR HAS BEEN SO GREAT AT SINCE

01:14:02.204 --> 01:14:03.338
THESE ISSUES ARE SUPER

01:14:03.405 --> 01:14:04.706
TECHNICAL, TO GIVE THE

01:14:04.773 --> 01:14:06.308
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE COMMITTEE TO

01:14:06.375 --> 01:14:07.776
BE ABLE TO REALLY DIG DEEP

01:14:07.843 --> 01:14:09.812
BEFORE TAKING ANY VOTES ON

01:14:09.878 --> 01:14:13.782
THINGS. YEAH, YEAH, I CAN, I CAN

01:14:13.849 --> 01:14:17.719
CHIME IN. I THINK IN GENERAL,

01:14:17.786 --> 01:14:19.588
WHAT'S BEEN VERY HELPFUL IN BOTH

01:14:19.655 --> 01:14:21.356
OF THE EXAMPLES WE PROVIDED

01:14:21.423 --> 01:14:24.827
TODAY IS PROVIDING ENOUGH OF A

01:14:24.893 --> 01:14:26.361
STRUCTURE, BUT SOME FLEXIBILITY

01:14:26.428 --> 01:14:28.130
TO THE COMMISSION TO DETERMINE

01:14:28.197 --> 01:14:29.898
IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS. SO

01:14:29.965 --> 01:14:32.401
THINGS LIKE HOW TO SET THE

01:14:32.467 --> 01:14:33.902
REGULATORY FEE, HOW MUCH TO SET

01:14:33.969 --> 01:14:36.071
IT AT. THAT'S ANOTHER THING.

01:14:36.138 --> 01:14:37.906
WE'VE USED THE ANNUAL REPORT TO

01:14:37.973 --> 01:14:40.342
INFORM. AND SO I THINK THAT'S

01:14:40.409 --> 01:14:42.611
BEEN A HELPFUL KIND OF APPROACH

01:14:42.678 --> 01:14:44.847
IN THE LEGISLATION. AND THEN

01:14:44.913 --> 01:14:46.515
JUST IN TERMS OF PROGRAM

01:14:46.582 --> 01:14:48.016
SUCCESSES, I THINK WITH THE

01:14:48.083 --> 01:14:51.186
ACCESS PROGRAM, WE'VE SEEN WE'VE

01:14:51.253 --> 01:14:52.421
HEARD DIRECTLY FROM CUSTOMERS

01:14:52.487 --> 01:14:54.356
AND WE'VE SEEN SO MANY TRIPS

01:14:54.423 --> 01:14:56.325
PROVIDED THAT THIS IS A SERVICE

01:14:56.391 --> 01:14:57.559
THAT WOULDN'T HAVE OTHERWISE

01:14:57.626 --> 01:15:00.095
BEEN AVAILABLE. SO I THINK WE'RE

01:15:00.162 --> 01:15:02.097
LOOKING AT THAT AS A SUCCESS,

01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:03.966
AND WE WOULD HOPE IT TO BE ABLE

01:15:04.032 --> 01:15:05.167
TO CONTINUE WITH THE CLEAN MILE

01:15:05.234 --> 01:15:06.201
STANDARD. THE BUILDING BLOCKS

01:15:06.268 --> 01:15:07.970
ARE THERE, BUT IT HASN'T BEEN

01:15:08.036 --> 01:15:09.271
FULLY IMPLEMENTED YET. SO

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:11.306
THERE'S NOT MUCH TO COMMENT ON

01:15:11.373 --> 01:15:13.709
IN TERMS OF SUCCESS YET, BUT I

01:15:13.775 --> 01:15:15.310
LOOK FORWARD TO REPORTING BACK.

01:15:15.377 --> 01:15:17.112
YEAH. THANK YOU. AND I CAN

01:15:17.179 --> 01:15:19.047
FOLLOW UP WITH YOU AS WELL TO

01:15:19.114 --> 01:15:21.717
PICK YOUR BRAIN A LITTLE BIT

01:15:21.783 --> 01:15:22.384
MORE ON PAST LEGISLATION. AND IN

01:15:22.451 --> 01:15:23.552
TERMS OF I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT

01:15:23.619 --> 01:15:25.721
AS AN INDUSTRY, BUT IN TERMS OF

01:15:25.787 --> 01:15:28.290
MAYBE THE WORKFORCE. CAN YOU

01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:29.458
SHARE ANY TRENDS THAT YOU'VE

01:15:29.524 --> 01:15:31.660
SEEN AS IT RELATES TO WORKERS

01:15:31.727 --> 01:15:33.328
AND THE WORKFORCE IN THIS

01:15:33.395 --> 01:15:34.696
INDUSTRY? HAS THERE BEEN A

01:15:34.763 --> 01:15:35.831
FLUCTUATION OR WHAT HAVE ANY

01:15:35.898 --> 01:15:36.965
TRENDS THAT YOU'VE SEEN THAT

01:15:37.032 --> 01:15:39.701
WOULD BE HELPFUL TO SHARE?

01:15:39.768 --> 01:15:43.005
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. I MEAN,

01:15:43.071 --> 01:15:45.307
I THINK THE THING THAT IS TOP OF

01:15:45.374 --> 01:15:46.742
MY MIND RELATED TO THE WORKFORCE

01:15:46.808 --> 01:15:48.076
IS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

01:15:48.143 --> 01:15:49.511
CLEAN MILES STANDARD, BECAUSE

01:15:49.578 --> 01:15:52.881
THAT SO, SO INHERENTLY RELATES

01:15:52.948 --> 01:15:55.550
TO THE DRIVERS OF THE TNCS. AND

01:15:55.617 --> 01:15:57.085
SO IT'S BEEN IMPORTANT TO THE

01:15:57.152 --> 01:15:58.220
COMMISSION, AND IT'S BEEN

01:15:58.287 --> 01:15:59.621
IMPORTANT TO STAFF TO IMPLEMENT

01:15:59.688 --> 01:16:00.956
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THE

01:16:01.023 --> 01:16:02.858
DRIVER'S ASSISTANCE PROGRAM TO

01:16:02.925 --> 01:16:04.760
SUPPORT THEIR TRANSITION, KIND

01:16:04.826 --> 01:16:06.995
OF GIVEN THEIR UNIQUE EMPLOYMENT

01:16:07.062 --> 01:16:11.133
STATUS WITH THE TNCS. HAVE YOU

01:16:11.199 --> 01:16:13.268
SEEN A GROWTH IN THE INDUSTRY OR

01:16:13.335 --> 01:16:15.203
IS THERE? I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT

01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:16.104
TRENDS YOU'RE SEEING

01:16:16.171 --> 01:16:17.940
SPECIFICALLY WITH THE WORKFORCE.

01:16:18.006 --> 01:16:21.209
YEAH, WE HAVE DEFINITELY SEEN

01:16:21.276 --> 01:16:23.312
GROWTH. THERE WAS A NOTABLE DIP

01:16:23.378 --> 01:16:25.247
THAT WAS CONSISTENT ACROSS ALL

01:16:25.314 --> 01:16:26.915
THE PASSENGER TRANSPORTATION

01:16:26.982 --> 01:16:29.418
INDUSTRY DURING 2020, 2021,

01:16:29.484 --> 01:16:31.787
DURING THE COVID PANDEMIC THAT

01:16:31.853 --> 01:16:33.388
HAS BEEN STEADILY REBOUNDING

01:16:33.455 --> 01:16:36.692
ACROSS ALL OF OUR CARRIER TYPES.

01:16:36.758 --> 01:16:40.062
AS OF VERY RECENTLY. I THINK

01:16:40.128 --> 01:16:42.831
OVERALL, WE HAVE AROUND 8000

01:16:42.898 --> 01:16:43.832
PASSENGER TRANSPORTATION<u>%</u>

01:16:43.899 --> 01:16:45.667
COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE

01:16:45.734 --> 01:16:48.203
ISSUE LICENSES TO, AND THAT'S UP

01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:50.038
FROM A PRE-PANDEMIC HIGH OF

01:16:50.105 --> 01:16:52.574
AROUND 6000. SO IT'S NOT ONLY

01:16:52.641 --> 01:16:54.643
REBOUNDED, BUT IT'S GROWN BEYOND

01:16:54.710 --> 01:16:58.513
THAT INITIAL BENCHMARK. GOT IT.

01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:02.851
THANK YOU. AND KIND OF BOUNCING

01:17:02.918 --> 01:17:04.086
OFF OF WHAT ASSEMBLYMEMBER

01:17:04.152 --> 01:17:06.688
ROGERS SAID AND HOW MAYBE SOME

01:17:06.755 --> 01:17:09.024
OF THIS HAS PASSED DOWN TO THE

01:17:09.091 --> 01:17:10.492
CONSUMER. I FEEL LIKE EVERY TIME

01:17:10.559 --> 01:17:13.662
I TAKE A TRIP, THE RECEIPT HAS

01:17:13.729 --> 01:17:15.964
GOTTEN MUCH LONGER. CAN YOU

01:17:16.031 --> 01:17:18.500
EXPLAIN TO WHAT EXTENT YOU'VE

01:17:18.567 --> 01:17:20.702
DONE ANY ANALYSIS ON HOW COSTS

01:17:20.769 --> 01:17:24.306
ARE PASSED ON TO THE RIDERS, TO

01:17:24.373 --> 01:17:25.974
CONSUMERS, HOW MUCH THAT'S

01:17:26.041 --> 01:17:26.575
CHANGED, OR IS THAT SOMETHING

01:17:26.641 --> 01:17:29.244
THAT YOU REGULATE SPECIFICALLY

01:17:29.311 --> 01:17:30.645
OF HOW THAT'S NOTICED TO

01:17:30.712 --> 01:17:34.716
CUSTOMERS FARES IN THE

01:17:34.783 --> 01:17:35.650
TRANSPORTATION? THESE TYPES OF

01:17:35.717 --> 01:17:37.185
PASSENGER TRANSPORTATION

01:17:37.252 --> 01:17:38.286
COMPANIES ARE NOT SOMETHING THAT

01:17:38.353 --> 01:17:40.455
THE COMMISSION HAS EXERTED

01:17:40.522 --> 01:17:42.524
AUTHORITY OVER. HOWEVER, THAT

01:23:57.999 --> 01:23:59.801
ENDED WITH NO SAFETY INCIDENT AT

01:23:59.868 --> 01:24:01.903
ALL. THE MOTOR VEHICLE FATALITY

01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:03.438
RATE, ALSO ON THE UBER PLATFORM,

01:24:03.505 --> 01:24:04.806
REMAINS SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER THAN

01:24:04.873 --> 01:24:07.909
THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. WE KNOW

01:24:07.976 --> 01:24:10.178
SAFETY INCIDENT REPRESENTS AN

01:24:10.245 --> 01:24:11.880
EXPERIENCE OF A PERSON AND

01:24:11.946 --> 01:24:13.548
IMPACTS INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES

01:24:13.615 --> 01:24:15.183
AND COMMUNITIES, WHICH IS WHY

01:24:15.250 --> 01:24:17.352
OUR WORK ON SAFETY CONTINUES. WE

01:24:17.419 --> 01:24:19.521
HAVE INVESTED TECHNOLOGY,

01:24:19.587 --> 01:24:20.522
RIGOROUS STANDARDS AND MANY

01:24:20.588 --> 01:24:22.090
SAFETY FEATURES THAT GO BEYOND

01:24:22.157 --> 01:24:23.825
WHAT IS REQUIRED BY LAW. WE

01:24:23.892 --> 01:24:25.293
TRACK EVERY TRIP, OFFERING

01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:26.828
EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE IF NEEDED,

01:24:26.895 --> 01:24:28.096
AND GIVE RIDERS AND DRIVERS

01:24:28.163 --> 01:24:29.964
TOOLS LIKE TRIP SHARING, PIN

01:24:30.031 --> 01:24:31.800
VERIFICATION TO FEEL SECURE. IN

01:24:31.866 --> 01:24:33.201
ADDITION TO UBER'S MULTI-STEP

01:24:33.268 --> 01:24:34.335
SCREENING PROCESS, WE ALSO USE

01:24:34.402 --> 01:24:36.438
OUR REAL-TIME ID CHECK TO ENSURE

01:24:36.504 --> 01:24:38.573
DRIVERS ARE THE SAME PERSON WHO

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:40.008
PASSED OUR SCREENINGS. WE ALSO

01:24:40.074 --> 01:24:42.210
USE TECHNOLOGY TO HELP SAFETY ON

01:24:42.277 --> 01:24:44.312
FOR ALL ROAD USERS, NOT JUST OUR

01:24:44.379 --> 01:24:46.147
DRIVERS AND RIDERS. FOR EXAMPLE,

01:24:46.214 --> 01:24:47.415
REDUCING THE NUMBER OF LEFT

01:24:47.482 --> 01:24:48.883
TURNS IN OUR IN-APP NAVIGATION,

01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:50.919
REMINDING DRIVERS TO WATCH FOR

01:24:50.985 --> 01:24:51.553
CROSS-TRAFFIC WHEN THEY APPROACH

01:24:51.619 --> 01:24:53.321
AN INTERSECTION, ALERTING RIDERS

01:24:53.388 --> 01:24:54.789
TO WEAR THEIR SEATBELT BEFORE

01:24:54.856 --> 01:24:56.357
TRIPS BEGIN, AND ALERTING RIDERS

01:24:56.424 --> 01:24:58.026
AND DRIVERS WHEN TO PICK UP OR

01:24:58.092 --> 01:25:00.962
DROP OFF IS NEAR A BIKE LANE.

01:25:01.029 --> 01:25:03.097
CALIFORNIA IS ALSO AN INCUBATOR

01:25:03.164 --> 01:25:04.232
FOR POLICIES THAT WE SEE TRACK

01:25:04.299 --> 01:25:05.366
ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND BEYOND.

01:25:05.433 --> 01:25:07.435
IN FACT, TNC LEGISLATION CREATED

01:25:07.502 --> 01:25:09.604
HERE NOW EXISTS IN ALMOST EVERY

01:25:09.671 --> 01:25:11.573
STATE IN AMERICA. THE CALIFORNIA

01:25:13.274 --> 01:25:15.109
ESTABLISHED BY SENATE BILL 1014

01:25:15.176 --> 01:25:17.812
IN 2018, SETS TARGETS ON TNCS TO

01:25:17.879 --> 01:25:18.913
INCREASE THE NUMBER. THE

01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:20.014
PERCENTAGE OF ZERO EMISSION

01:25:20.081 --> 01:25:21.149

01:25:27.755 --> 01:25:28.756
ENGAGE POSITIVELY IN THE PROCESS

01:25:28.823 --> 01:25:31.159
AND IS COMMITTED TO A SUCCESSFUL

01:25:31.226 --> 01:25:32.260
PROGRAM. TODAY, UBER IS PROUD TO

01:25:32.327 --> 01:25:33.761
RUN THE WORLD'S MOST WIDELY

01:25:33.828 --> 01:25:34.896

01:25:40.101 --> 01:25:42.670
THAN 105 MILLION TRIPS EACH

01:25:42.737 --> 01:25:44.873

01:25:44.939 --> 01:25:46.241
ZERO EMISSIONS TRIPS EACH SECOND

01:25:46.307 --> 01:25:48.676

CALIFORNIA, UBER DRIVERS OUTPACE

01:25:50.044 --> 01:25:52.780

EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PROGRAM

01:25:57.952 --> 01:25:58.786
REQUIRES GREAT PARTNERSHIP WITH

01:25:58.853 --> 01:26:00.655
THE CPUC. WHILE UBER REMAINS

01:26:00.722 --> 01:26:01.990
COMMITTED TO ACHIEVING THE CLEAN

01:26:02.056 --> 01:26:03.758
MILE STANDARD GOALS, WHICH

01:26:03.825 --> 01:26:06.427
REQUIRES TNCS TO AVERAGE 30% VMT

01:26:06.494 --> 01:26:08.663
OVER THE NEXT YEAR AND 90% VMT

01:26:08.730 --> 01:26:11.132
BY 2030, WE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE

01:26:11.199 --> 01:26:12.534
THIS OPPORTUNITY TO FLAG THAT

01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:13.868
THERE ARE POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT

01:26:13.935 --> 01:26:15.703
HEADWINDS IN THE FUTURE. IT

01:26:15.770 --> 01:26:17.205
REMAINS UNCLEAR WHETHER

01:26:17.272 --> 01:26:18.139
CALIFORNIA RIDESHARE DRIVERS

01:26:18.206 --> 01:26:19.440
WILL HAVE ACCESS TO ENOUGH

01:26:19.507 --> 01:26:21.242
AFFORDABLE EV OPTIONS IN THE

01:26:21.309 --> 01:26:22.644

01:26:22.710 --> 01:26:25.113
TARGETS OF CMS. FOR REFERENCE,

01:26:25.179 --> 01:26:26.948

01:26:32.353 --> 01:26:33.788
THE STATE'S AUTHORITY FOR THE

01:26:33.855 --> 01:26:35.290
LATTER PROGRAM WAS RECENTLY PUT

01:26:35.356 --> 01:26:36.391
INTO QUESTION BY FEDERAL

GOVERNMENT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT,

01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:39.794
WHICH COULD DIRECTLY IMPACT CMS

01:26:39.861 --> 01:26:42.764
OUTCOMES. UBER CONTINUES TO WORK

01:26:42.830 --> 01:26:43.831
TOWARDS ELECTRIFICATION, AND

01:26:43.898 --> 01:26:44.832
WE'VE INVESTED HUNDREDS OF

01:26:44.899 --> 01:26:46.734
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO HELP

01:26:46.801 --> 01:26:47.435
INTERESTED DRIVERS MAKE THE

INCENTIVES, PARTNERSHIPS AND

01:26:50.438 --> 01:26:51.940
PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS. CLIMATE IS

01:26:52.006 --> 01:26:53.575
A TEAM SPORT AND PROGRESS

01:26:53.641 --> 01:26:55.777
DEPENDS ON A COLLECTIVE ACTION.

01:26:55.843 --> 01:26:57.245
WE COULD FALL SHORT OF CMS

01:26:57.312 --> 01:26:58.580
TARGET WITHOUT BETTER PUBLIC AND

01:26:58.646 --> 01:27:00.081
PRIVATE INVESTMENT. AT THE END

01:27:00.148 --> 01:27:02.250
OF THE DAY, UBER NEVER WANTS TO

01:27:02.317 --> 01:27:03.585
HAVE TO TELL LOW INCOME

01:27:03.651 --> 01:27:04.419
CALIFORNIAN, WHO IS SIMPLY

01:27:04.485 --> 01:27:05.853
LOOKING FOR INCOME

01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:06.588
OPPORTUNITIES, THAT THEY'RE NOT

01:27:06.654 --> 01:27:08.456
ALLOWED TO DRIVE ON THE UBER

01:27:08.523 --> 01:27:09.390
PLATFORM BECAUSE THEY CAN'T

01:27:09.457 --> 01:27:11.225
AFFORD AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE.

01:27:11.292 --> 01:27:13.494
MOVING ON TO THE ACCESS FOR ALL

01:27:13.561 --> 01:27:16.364
PROGRAM CREATED BY SB 1376 IN

01:27:16.431 --> 01:27:18.099
2018, WHICH FOCUSES ON IMPROVING

01:27:18.166 --> 01:27:19.233
TRANSPORTATION ACCESS TO

01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:20.635
INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES,

01:27:20.702 --> 01:27:22.670
UBER IS COMMITTED TO PROVIDING

01:27:22.737 --> 01:27:25.073
INCLUSIVE TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS

01:27:25.139 --> 01:27:27.008
AND CONTINUES TO EXPAND ITS

01:27:27.075 --> 01:27:28.710
EFFORTS IN THIS AREA. OVER THE

01:27:28.776 --> 01:27:30.244
LAST TWO YEARS, WE'VE INVESTED

01:27:30.311 --> 01:27:32.280
OVER $20 MILLION IN CALIFORNIA

01:27:32.347 --> 01:27:33.648
IN EXPANDING ACCESS TO

01:27:33.715 --> 01:27:34.616
WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE VEHICLES.

01:27:34.682 --> 01:27:36.818
IN CALIFORNIA, WE'VE

01:27:36.884 --> 01:27:38.653
CONSISTENTLY MET ACCESS FOR ALL

01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:40.021
PROGRAM OFFSET ELIGIBILITY

01:27:40.088 --> 01:27:41.422

01:27:41.489 --> 01:27:43.791
FRANCISCO, AND SAN MATEO FOR SIX

01:27:43.858 --> 01:27:44.626
CONSECUTIVE QUARTERS, A

01:27:44.692 --> 01:27:46.227
TESTAMENT TO OUR SIGNIFICANT

01:27:46.294 --> 01:27:46.894
INVESTMENT IN EXPANDING

01:27:46.961 --> 01:27:48.696
WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE VEHICLES

01:27:48.763 --> 01:27:50.798
AND OUTREACH TO THE DISABILITY

01:27:50.865 --> 01:27:53.801
COMMUNITY. HOWEVER, IN 2025,

01:27:53.868 --> 01:27:54.802
WE'VE ENCOUNTERED CHALLENGES IN

01:27:54.869 --> 01:27:57.338
MEETING PERFORMANCE METRICS,

01:27:57.405 --> 01:27:58.039
ALTHOUGH ALTHOUGH THAT HAS NOT

01:27:58.106 --> 01:28:01.342
COME TO FRUITION YET. BECAUSE OF

01:28:01.409 --> 01:28:03.411
THE INCREASED COST OF WAVE

01:28:03.478 --> 01:28:05.947
SERVICE SUPPLY, AS WELL AS

01:28:06.014 --> 01:28:07.715
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED DEMAND

01:28:07.782 --> 01:28:10.385
OVER THE LAST YEAR OR TWO, UBER

01:28:10.451 --> 01:28:13.087
HAS INCREASED COMPLETED WAVE

01:28:13.154 --> 01:28:15.323
TRIPS BY THREE X WHILE

01:28:15.390 --> 01:28:17.158
SIMULTANEOUSLY INCREASING

01:28:17.225 --> 01:28:19.227
RELIABILITY BY THREE X, WHICH IS

01:28:19.293 --> 01:28:20.762
TYPICALLY TWO METRICS THAT

01:28:20.828 --> 01:28:21.929
COUNTERACT EACH OTHER. WE'RE

01:28:21.996 --> 01:28:24.732
VERY PROUD OF THIS, BUT OUR BUT

01:28:24.799 --> 01:28:27.001
LIKE I SAID, DEMAND AND SUPPLY

01:28:27.068 --> 01:28:29.303
ARE NOW NO LONGER MATCHING OUR

01:28:29.370 --> 01:28:30.738
RECENT PARTNERSHIP WITH TAXI

01:28:30.805 --> 01:28:33.207
TAXI SERVICES, PARTICULARLY RAMP

01:28:33.274 --> 01:28:34.742
TAXIS, OFFER A PROMISING PATH

01:28:34.809 --> 01:28:36.177
FORWARD TO ADVANCE THE PROGRAM'S

01:28:36.244 --> 01:28:38.046
GOALS. SIMILAR TO THE CLEAN MILE

01:28:38.112 --> 01:28:39.347
STANDARD. WE FEEL STRONGLY THAT

01:28:39.414 --> 01:28:41.683
IN ORDER FOR THIS PROGRAM TO BE

01:28:41.749 --> 01:28:42.383
SUCCESSFUL IN ACHIEVING THE

01:28:42.450 --> 01:28:43.551
GOALS SET OUT BY THE

01:28:43.618 --> 01:28:45.253
LEGISLATURE, IT'S GOING TO TAKE

01:28:45.319 --> 01:28:46.354
MORE THAN UBER ALONE, WITH MORE

01:28:46.421 --> 01:28:47.622
HELP FROM THE STATE AND MORE

01:28:47.689 --> 01:28:49.157
PARTICIPATION FROM OTHERS, WE

01:28:49.223 --> 01:28:50.625
CAN REVAMP OUR SERVICES TO

01:28:50.692 --> 01:28:52.460
BETTER AND MORE BE MORE

01:28:52.527 --> 01:28:54.328
ACCESSIBLE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS.

01:28:54.395 --> 01:28:55.897
RIDE SHARING HAS BEEN CONSTANTLY

01:28:55.963 --> 01:28:56.931
EVOLVING SINCE WE PIONEERED

01:28:56.998 --> 01:28:58.132
SINCE IT WAS PIONEERED IN

01:28:58.199 --> 01:28:59.534
CALIFORNIA OVER A DECADE AGO,

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:01.035
AND THAT EVOLUTION IS

01:29:01.102 --> 01:29:02.170
ACCELERATING IN THE STATE AND

01:29:02.236 --> 01:29:03.905
BEYOND. IT CONTINUES TO OFFER

01:29:03.971 --> 01:29:05.339
EARNINGS OPPORTUNITIES TO

01:29:05.406 --> 01:29:06.874
MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS AND

01:29:06.941 --> 01:29:08.276
CONVENIENT RIDES TO MILLIONS

01:29:08.342 --> 01:29:10.344
MORE. ACROSS THE GLOBE. WE ARE

01:29:10.411 --> 01:29:12.113
SEEING THE DEPLOYMENT OF

01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:13.347
AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES AS A NEW

01:29:13.414 --> 01:29:15.083
TRANSPORTATION OPTION, AND IN

01:29:15.149 --> 01:29:16.484
CALIFORNIA, WE KNOW THAT THERE

01:29:16.551 --> 01:29:17.719
ARE MAJOR EVENTS COMING SOON

01:29:17.785 --> 01:29:19.153
THAT WILL REQUIRE THAT WILL

01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:20.388
REQUIRE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF

01:29:20.455 --> 01:29:22.190
FLEXIBLE TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS.

01:29:22.256 --> 01:29:23.524
WITH THE WORLD CUP AND OLYMPICS

01:29:23.591 --> 01:29:25.293
HAPPENING JUST IN THE NEXT FEW

01:29:25.359 --> 01:29:26.561
YEARS, ALL OF THESE

01:29:26.627 --> 01:29:27.261
OPPORTUNITIES REQUIRE CLOSE

01:29:27.328 --> 01:29:28.062
COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE

01:29:28.129 --> 01:29:29.731
PRIVATE SECTOR AND GOVERNMENT,

01:29:29.797 --> 01:29:30.498
AND WE'RE EXCITED TO KEEP

01:29:30.565 --> 01:29:32.200
BUILDING ON THE SUCCESS OF THE

01:29:32.266 --> 01:29:33.534
LAST DECADE OF INNOVATION IN THE

01:29:33.601 --> 01:29:35.970

01:29:36.037 --> 01:29:37.138
TO COLLABORATING WITH THE CPUC

01:29:37.205 --> 01:29:38.806
AND THE LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE

01:29:38.873 --> 01:29:40.341
ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO

01:29:40.408 --> 01:29:42.810
SAFE, RELIABLE, SUSTAINABLE

01:29:42.877 --> 01:29:43.811

BALANCE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IS

01:29:45.646 --> 01:29:47.849
KEY FOR INNOVATION WHILE

01:37:23.938 --> 01:37:24.705
APPRECIATES THIS COMMITTEE'S

01:37:24.772 --> 01:37:25.940
LEADERSHIP ORGANIZING A HEARING

01:37:26.006 --> 01:37:28.642
AROUND SUCH IMPORTANT TOPICS

01:37:28.709 --> 01:37:29.276
SPECIFIC TO TNCS IN THE STATE.

01:37:29.343 --> 01:37:32.947
THANK YOU. I HAVE NO FURTHER

01:37:33.013 --> 01:37:35.916
COMMENT. OKAY, THANK YOU SO

01:37:35.983 --> 01:37:38.018
MUCH. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE

01:37:38.085 --> 01:37:41.722
MEMBERS. NO QUESTIONS FROM

01:37:41.789 --> 01:37:43.490
COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ASSEMBLY

01:37:43.557 --> 01:37:46.393
MEMBER ROGERS. HELLO EVERYBODY.

01:37:46.460 --> 01:37:49.263
FUN TO HAVE A CONVERSATION. JUST

01:37:49.330 --> 01:37:51.065
FOLLOWING UP ON THE QUESTIONS

01:37:51.131 --> 01:37:52.866
THAT I ASKED IN THE PREVIOUS

01:37:52.933 --> 01:37:54.235
PANEL, IT WAS MENTIONED THAT

01:37:54.301 --> 01:37:55.369
THERE MIGHT BE A TECHNICAL ISSUE

01:37:55.436 --> 01:37:57.805
AROUND SOME OF THE DATA SHARING.

01:37:57.871 --> 01:38:00.007
CAN YOU GO INTO THAT A LITTLE

01:38:00.074 --> 01:38:01.508
BIT, WHAT THAT ACTUALLY MEANS

01:38:01.575 --> 01:38:06.513
AND IS? I'M HAPPY TO GO. YOU CAN

01:38:06.580 --> 01:38:09.350
GO FIRST. YES. I WOULDN'T

01:38:09.416 --> 01:38:11.185
NECESSARILY REFER TO IT AS A

01:38:11.252 --> 01:38:13.287
TECHNICAL ISSUE OR A CHALLENGE.

01:38:13.354 --> 01:38:15.823
THIS IS SIMPLY A LOT OF DATA,

01:38:15.889 --> 01:38:18.792
AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HUNDREDS

01:38:18.859 --> 01:38:22.196
OF MILLIONS OF ROWS BY 85

01:38:22.263 --> 01:38:23.397
COLUMNS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:38:23.464 --> 01:38:27.301
BILLIONS OF CELLS. AND THE CPC'S

01:38:27.368 --> 01:38:29.803
NEW PORTAL, WHICH WHICH THEY

01:38:29.870 --> 01:38:30.571
INTRODUCED WITHIN THE LAST YEAR

01:38:30.638 --> 01:38:32.740
OR SO, HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL IN

01:38:32.806 --> 01:38:36.677
SUBMITTING THE DATA. AND IT'S A

01:38:36.744 --> 01:38:38.545
MATTER OF PRODUCING IT AND

01:38:38.612 --> 01:38:40.381
HANDING IT OVER SAFELY. NOT ONLY

01:38:40.447 --> 01:38:42.516
IS IT A LOT OF DATA, IT'S A LOT

01:38:42.583 --> 01:38:44.218
OF VERY SENSITIVE DATA. THERE'S

01:38:44.285 --> 01:38:46.487
LOCATION DATA, WHICH, AS I

01:38:46.553 --> 01:38:47.621
MENTIONED IN MY TESTIMONY, CAN

01:38:47.688 --> 01:38:49.957
BE PARTICULARLY SCARY TO SHARE.

01:38:50.024 --> 01:38:51.725
THERE'S PII PERSONALLY

01:38:51.792 --> 01:38:53.294
IDENTIFYING INFORMATION, WHICH

01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:57.231
IS VERY SCARY TO SHARE. AND

01:38:57.298 --> 01:39:00.034
THESE ARE PEOPLE, RIGHT? THE

01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:03.003
DATA SUBMISSIONS ARE ARE THAT OF

01:39:03.070 --> 01:39:04.338
CALIFORNIANS. RIGHT. THIS IS

01:39:04.405 --> 01:39:05.806
DATA THAT WE'RE SHARING ABOUT

01:39:05.873 --> 01:39:07.107
REAL PEOPLE. AND IT'S AND IT'S

01:39:07.174 --> 01:39:10.177
EASY TO THINK LIKE, OH, THIS IS

01:39:10.244 --> 01:39:10.744
JUST RIDESHARE DATA. THIS IS

01:39:10.811 --> 01:39:12.479
JUST DATA FROM UBER AND LYFT.

01:39:12.546 --> 01:39:13.747
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY TRUE.

01:39:13.814 --> 01:39:16.016
RIGHT. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHERE

01:39:16.083 --> 01:39:18.352
THEY'RE GOING, WHERE ACCIDENTS

01:39:18.419 --> 01:39:20.254
ARE OCCURRING. THERE'S A LOT OF

01:39:20.321 --> 01:39:22.756
SCARY PRIVACY RISKS THERE. BUT

01:39:22.823 --> 01:39:24.491
THE TECHNICAL CHALLENGE HAS

01:39:24.558 --> 01:39:28.162
LARGELY BEEN OVERCOME. AND I, I

01:39:28.228 --> 01:39:30.030
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT SO MUCH

01:39:30.097 --> 01:39:31.899
ANYMORE AS I DO ABOUT THE

01:39:31.965 --> 01:39:34.702
PRIVACY OF THE DATA AND THE

01:39:34.768 --> 01:39:36.470
SENSITIVITY OF THE DATA. THAT'S

01:39:36.537 --> 01:39:39.907
HELPFUL. THANK YOU. I THINK WE

01:39:39.973 --> 01:39:42.609
HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD. ANYTHING.

01:39:42.676 --> 01:39:43.811
LYFT DOES NOT HAVE A COMMENT TO

01:39:43.877 --> 01:39:49.717
ADD. OKAY. SO WITH THAT I HAVE A

01:39:49.783 --> 01:39:52.853
YEAH, YEAH YEAH, THERE'S A LOT.

01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:56.156
OKAY. THE TNCS WERE ONCE VIEWED

01:39:56.223 --> 01:39:59.093
AS A DISRUPTIVE INDUSTRY THAT

01:39:59.159 --> 01:40:01.762
PUSHED THE MARKET INTO NEW AREAS

01:40:01.829 --> 01:40:03.530
AND CHALLENGED LONG STANDING

01:40:03.597 --> 01:40:07.134
PUBLIC POLICIES TO EACH OF THE

01:40:07.201 --> 01:40:08.902
TNCS. WHAT HAS BEEN THE MOST

01:40:08.969 --> 01:40:11.705
IMPACTFUL POLICY DECISION THAT

01:40:11.772 --> 01:40:12.840
HAS IMPACTED YOUR COMPANY'S

01:40:12.906 --> 01:40:17.144
OPERATIONS? I KNOW WE'RE GETTING

01:40:17.211 --> 01:40:20.414
PHILOSOPHICAL HERE. MOST MOST

01:40:20.481 --> 01:40:21.215
IMPACTFUL. I'LL GO AHEAD AND

01:40:21.281 --> 01:40:22.950
TAKE A STAB AT THAT. SO MOST

01:40:23.016 --> 01:40:25.819
IMPACTFUL POLICY DECISION BY THE

01:40:25.886 --> 01:40:28.322
LEGISLATURE, YOU MEAN, SURE, YOU

01:40:28.389 --> 01:40:30.023
COULD ALSO DO REGULATORY. WHY

01:40:30.090 --> 01:40:31.859
DON'T YOU DO ONE OF EACH IF YOU

01:40:31.925 --> 01:40:33.227
HAVE OPINION ON ONE OF EACH?

01:40:33.293 --> 01:40:35.162
SURE, SURE. SO I WILL I WILL

01:40:35.229 --> 01:40:36.864
TAKE THE LEGISLATURE FIRST. I

01:40:36.930 --> 01:40:41.402
THINK THERE IS SIMPLY NO OTHER

01:40:41.468 --> 01:40:43.303
CHOICE THAN FOR US TO EMBRACE

01:40:43.370 --> 01:40:45.806
THE FACT THAT CLIMATE IS A TEAM

01:40:45.873 --> 01:40:48.409
SPORT. AND SO THE, THE, THE

01:40:48.475 --> 01:40:50.344
CLEAN MILES STANDARD, WHILE IT'S

01:40:50.411 --> 01:40:52.446
HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR

01:40:52.513 --> 01:40:53.547
OPERATIONS, AND CERTAINLY IT'S A

01:40:53.614 --> 01:40:55.682
IT'S A PER TRIP FEE THAT

01:40:55.749 --> 01:40:57.651
CUSTOMERS HAVE TO PAY AND THEN

01:40:57.718 --> 01:40:59.319
TAKE, THERE IS NO OTHER CHOICE

01:40:59.386 --> 01:41:01.622
FOR, FOR SOCIETY THAN, THAN TO

01:41:01.688 --> 01:41:03.490
MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION. AND SO

01:41:03.557 --> 01:41:04.625
FOR US, I WOULD CERTAINLY

01:41:04.691 --> 01:41:05.793
DESCRIBE THAT AS THE MOST

01:41:05.859 --> 01:41:07.594
IMPACTFUL POLICY THAT THE

01:41:07.661 --> 01:41:09.296
LEGISLATURE HAS HAS PASSED. AND

01:41:09.363 --> 01:41:11.131
FOR US, WE ARE VERY DEDICATED TO

01:41:11.198 --> 01:41:12.866
MAKING SURE THAT IS A SUCCESSFUL

01:41:12.933 --> 01:41:14.168
PROGRAM AND THAT, AS WE SAID IN

01:41:14.234 --> 01:41:15.869
OUR TESTIMONY, THAT REQUIRES

01:41:15.936 --> 01:41:17.204
GREAT AND SUCCESSFUL

01:41:17.271 --> 01:41:18.405
COLLABORATION AND PARTNERSHIP

01:41:18.472 --> 01:41:20.240
WITH THE CPUC. BUT THAT IS THAT

01:41:20.307 --> 01:41:21.842
IS SOMETHING THAT THE HEADWINDS

01:41:21.909 --> 01:41:23.577
ON THAT ARE SOMETHING WE'RE VERY

01:41:23.644 --> 01:41:25.946
CONCERNED ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE

01:41:26.013 --> 01:41:27.314
GENERAL PUBLIC BEING ABLE TO

01:41:27.381 --> 01:41:28.615
ACCESS THESE TYPES OF VEHICLES,

01:41:28.682 --> 01:41:31.318
ACCESS ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING

01:41:31.385 --> 01:41:32.786
INFRASTRUCTURE. OUR DRIVERS WHO

01:41:32.853 --> 01:41:34.488
CHOOSE TO EARN ON THE UBER

01:41:34.555 --> 01:41:36.023
PLATFORM COME FROM THE GENERAL

01:41:36.089 --> 01:41:38.826
PUBLIC. AND SO IF WE ARE ALL AS

01:41:38.892 --> 01:41:40.527
CALIFORNIANS AND AS AMERICANS,

01:41:40.594 --> 01:41:41.795
IF WE'RE NOT READY FOR AN

01:41:41.862 --> 01:41:43.730
ELECTRIC FUTURE, THEN CERTAINLY

01:41:43.797 --> 01:41:45.098
PEOPLE WHO CHOOSE TO DRIVE FOR

01:41:45.165 --> 01:41:46.867
UBER AND LYFT ALSO CAN'T ACCESS

01:41:46.934 --> 01:41:49.403
THAT. AND AS WE SAID, THE WORST

01:41:49.470 --> 01:41:51.138
THING WOULD BE IF WE TOLD A LOW

01:41:51.205 --> 01:41:51.738
INCOME CALIFORNIAN BECAUSE YOU

01:41:51.805 --> 01:41:53.207
CAN'T AFFORD TO PURCHASE YOUR

01:41:53.273 --> 01:41:54.675
OWN EV, YOU CAN'T DRIVE FOR THIS

01:41:54.741 --> 01:41:56.510
PLATFORM. THIS IS THIS IS A

01:41:56.577 --> 01:41:58.645
REALLY EFFECTIVE EARNING

01:41:58.712 --> 01:42:00.080
OPPORTUNITY. IT'S THE FASTEST

01:42:00.147 --> 01:42:02.015
WAY TO MAKE A LITTLE MONEY

01:42:02.082 --> 01:42:03.116
QUICKLY, RIGHT? WHEN YOU NEED TO

01:42:03.183 --> 01:42:05.152
PAY A BILL NEXT WEEK IS TO EARN

01:42:05.219 --> 01:42:06.854
ON PLATFORMS LIKE THIS. SO THAT

01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:08.021
APPLIES TO THIS. THIS THE

01:42:08.088 --> 01:42:09.523
GENERAL CLIMATE PROBLEM. AS FAR

01:42:09.590 --> 01:42:11.358
AS REGULATORY, I WOULD I WOULD

01:42:11.425 --> 01:42:13.193
SAY THE SAME THING. THAT IS THAT

01:42:13.260 --> 01:42:14.328
IS THE FUTURE THAT IMPACTS ALL

01:42:14.394 --> 01:42:16.697
OF US, BUT ALSO THE CPUC. THIS

01:42:16.763 --> 01:42:18.398
DATA PRIVACY CONVERSATION IS

01:42:18.465 --> 01:42:21.201
VERY ESSENTIAL. AND PROTECTING

01:42:21.268 --> 01:42:22.870
AS AS MY COLLEAGUE DAVID CASE

01:42:22.936 --> 01:42:24.872
WAS SAYING, THESE ARE PEOPLE'S

01:42:24.938 --> 01:42:26.039
MOVEMENTS. THESE ARE PEOPLE'S

01:42:26.106 --> 01:42:27.207
FAMILIES WHERE THEY'RE WHERE

01:42:27.274 --> 01:42:28.442
THEY'RE GOING IN THEIR LIVES.

01:42:28.509 --> 01:42:29.243
AND SO JUST RECOGNIZING THAT,

01:42:29.309 --> 01:42:31.845
AND I THINK, I THINK WE'RE IN A

01:42:31.912 --> 01:42:33.814
GOOD PLACE WITH CALIFORNIA'S

01:42:33.881 --> 01:42:36.049
ROBUST PRIVACY PROTECTIONS.

01:42:36.116 --> 01:42:38.285
THANKS, JOHN. AND THANK YOU FOR

01:42:38.352 --> 01:42:41.154
YOUR QUESTION. I ONE PIECE OF

01:42:41.221 --> 01:42:43.657
LEGISLATION COMES TO MIND THAT I

01:42:43.724 --> 01:42:44.157
THINK HITS ON BOTH THE

01:42:44.224 --> 01:42:44.992
REGULATORY DYNAMIC, IN ADDITION

01:42:45.058 --> 01:42:46.727
TO HOW THE LEGISLATURE IS

01:42:46.793 --> 01:42:47.961
PROACTIVE IN TERMS OF SUPPORTING

01:42:48.028 --> 01:42:49.429
CALIFORNIANS. AND THAT'S

01:42:49.496 --> 01:42:51.698
SPECIFICALLY SENATE BILL 1376,

01:42:51.765 --> 01:42:52.799
WHICH IS THE ACCESS FOR ALL

01:42:52.866 --> 01:42:54.101
PROGRAM. THROUGH THIS PROGRAM,

01:42:54.167 --> 01:42:55.502
WE'RE ABLE TO SERVE TWO OF THE

01:42:55.569 --> 01:42:57.404
LARGEST COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF

01:42:57.471 --> 01:42:58.372
CALIFORNIA. THIS PLACE WE ALL

01:42:58.438 --> 01:43:01.308
CALL HOME BY PROVIDING EQUITABLE

01:43:01.375 --> 01:43:02.709
SERVICE, TRANSPORTATION, ACCESS

01:43:02.776 --> 01:43:04.444
TO FOLKS WHO NEED IT MOST BY WAY

01:43:04.511 --> 01:43:05.445
OF OUR WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE

01:43:05.512 --> 01:43:06.747
VEHICLE PROGRAM IN THE STATE.

01:43:06.813 --> 01:43:08.148
AND AS MY COLLEAGUES MENTIONED,

01:43:08.215 --> 01:43:09.449
THESE ARE ACTUAL PEOPLE. THESE

01:43:09.516 --> 01:43:11.118
ARE FOLKS WHO NEED TO GET TO THE

01:43:11.184 --> 01:43:12.753
GROCERY, GROCERY STORE, MEDICAL

01:43:12.819 --> 01:43:13.887
APPOINTMENTS, RUN ERRANDS, AND

01:43:13.954 --> 01:43:15.289
THE ABILITY TO OFFER THAT

01:43:15.355 --> 01:43:16.256
SERVICE IS SOMETHING THAT I

01:43:16.323 --> 01:43:18.659
THINK MY COLLEAGUE AND I VALUE

01:43:18.725 --> 01:43:20.460
HIGHLY IN THE WORK THAT WE GET

01:43:20.527 --> 01:43:22.529
TO DO AT LYFT, AND LEARNING AND

01:43:22.596 --> 01:43:24.731
WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE CPUC ON

01:43:24.798 --> 01:43:26.233
THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK,

01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:27.701
ENSURING THAT WE'RE HITTING

01:43:27.768 --> 01:43:31.972
METRICS IN TERMS OF RIDE VOLUME,

01:43:32.039 --> 01:43:33.840
HOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR WAVE

01:43:33.907 --> 01:43:34.808
SERVICE, HOW WE'RE MARKETING OUR

01:43:34.875 --> 01:43:36.310
WAVE SERVICE, AND ACTUALLY

01:43:36.376 --> 01:43:37.678
HEARING FROM DISABILITY RIGHTS

01:43:37.744 --> 01:43:39.546
ADVOCATES IN THE STATE ABOUT HOW

01:43:39.613 --> 01:43:40.681
WE CAN BETTER AND IMPROVE OUR

01:43:40.747 --> 01:43:41.648
SERVICES IS SOMETHING THAT I

01:43:41.715 --> 01:43:43.450
THINK BENEFITS ALL CALIFORNIANS,

01:43:43.517 --> 01:43:46.687
SPECIFICALLY FROM A PROACTIVE

01:43:46.753 --> 01:43:47.287
LENS. AND WE'RE HAPPY TO BE A

01:43:47.354 --> 01:43:49.690
PART OF THAT, THAT PROGRAM.

01:43:49.756 --> 01:43:52.359
OKAY. AND THAT GETS US TO THIS.

01:43:52.426 --> 01:43:54.194
ONE OF THE CRITICISMS OF THE

01:43:54.261 --> 01:43:56.029
TNCS IS THAT THEY HAVE

01:43:56.096 --> 01:43:57.364
NEGATIVELY IMPACTED PUBLIC

01:43:57.431 --> 01:43:59.132
TRANSIT. AND I'M CURIOUS TO GET

01:43:59.199 --> 01:44:00.968
YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT CRITICISM.

01:44:01.034 --> 01:44:03.870
AND IF YOU CAN SAY MORE ABOUT

01:44:03.937 --> 01:44:04.504
HOW YOU'VE PARTNERED WITH LOCAL

01:44:04.571 --> 01:44:09.309
TRANSIT. I'M HAPPY TO JUMP IN.

01:44:09.376 --> 01:44:11.979
THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION. ONE

01:44:12.045 --> 01:44:13.614
OF THE ISSUES THAT WE NAVIGATE

01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:16.883
IS FOLKS FEEL AS THOUGH TNCS ARE

01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:18.752
NOT A PART OF THE TRANSPORTATION

01:44:18.819 --> 01:44:20.487
ECOSYSTEM BY WAY OF TAXES AND

01:44:20.554 --> 01:44:22.756
FEES, AND HOW WE WORK WITH LOCAL

01:44:22.823 --> 01:44:25.092
GOVERNMENTS TO ENSURE THAT TNCS

01:44:25.158 --> 01:44:26.727
ARE PART OF THE CONVERSATION

01:44:26.793 --> 01:44:28.362
RELATED TO HOW TO BEST SERVE

01:44:28.428 --> 01:44:30.631
LOCAL COMMUNITIES, ONE SPECIFIC

01:44:30.697 --> 01:44:32.032
PROGRAM COMES TO MIND THAT WE

01:44:32.099 --> 01:44:34.401
HAVE WITH THE CITY OF MONROVIA.

01:44:34.468 --> 01:44:35.235
IT'S A FIRST MILE, LAST MILE

01:44:35.302 --> 01:44:37.104
PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP THAT

01:44:37.170 --> 01:44:39.272
ESSENTIALLY SUBSIDIZES RIDES. I

01:44:39.339 --> 01:44:40.307
THINK IT'S THREE BUCKS FOR

01:44:40.374 --> 01:44:42.175
ANYBODY LIVING IN A SPECIFIC

01:44:42.242 --> 01:44:43.477
GEOFENCE TO GET TO THE AMTRAK

01:44:43.543 --> 01:44:45.112
STATION SO THEY CAN GET TO LA

01:44:45.178 --> 01:44:47.247
COUNTY OR TO LA TO GET TO WORK.

01:44:47.314 --> 01:44:50.050
AND THAT IS A PRIME EXAMPLE OF

01:44:50.117 --> 01:44:51.451
HOW THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE

01:44:51.518 --> 01:44:52.052
SECTOR CAN COME TOGETHER TO

01:44:52.119 --> 01:44:53.020
SERVE, TO SOLVE TRANSPORTATION

01:44:53.086 --> 01:44:54.421
ISSUES, SPECIFICALLY FROM THIS

01:44:54.488 --> 01:44:56.523
FIRST MILE, LAST MILE TREND OR

01:44:56.590 --> 01:44:58.291
DYNAMIC IN A STATE WHERE PUBLIC

01:44:58.358 --> 01:45:01.094
TRANSIT IS IFFY AT BEST IN A LOT

01:45:01.161 --> 01:45:03.096
OF AREAS AS WELL. SO WE UTILIZE

01:45:03.163 --> 01:45:05.198
TNCS AND RIDESHARE TO GET PEOPLE

01:45:05.265 --> 01:45:07.000
TO ACTUALLY UTILIZE PUBLIC

01:45:07.067 --> 01:45:07.968
TRANSPORTATION INSTEAD OF JUST

01:45:08.035 --> 01:45:10.270
GETTING THEM TO WHERE THEY NEED

01:45:10.337 --> 01:45:11.905
TO GO. SO IT'S A IT'S A PERFECT

01:45:11.972 --> 01:45:13.106
PARTNERSHIP, IN MY OPINION, TO

01:45:13.173 --> 01:45:14.374
EXPAND ON THAT A LITTLE BIT.

01:45:14.441 --> 01:45:16.076
FROM UBER'S PERSPECTIVE, WE HAVE

01:45:16.143 --> 01:45:17.811
A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT

01:45:17.878 --> 01:45:18.712
PARTNERSHIPS WITH TRANSIT

01:45:18.779 --> 01:45:20.280
AGENCIES IN THE STATE OF

01:45:20.347 --> 01:45:21.248
CALIFORNIA, AND WE ARE ALWAYS

01:45:21.314 --> 01:45:23.817
LOOKING TO GROW THOSE. I THINK

01:45:23.884 --> 01:45:26.420
AS WE ENVISION OURSELVES AS

01:45:26.486 --> 01:45:28.188
BEING THE WAY YOU CAN GO

01:45:28.255 --> 01:45:30.424
ANYWHERE IN THE STATE. AND SO IF

01:45:30.490 --> 01:45:31.825
YOU WANT TO GET ACROSS TOWN, WE

01:45:31.892 --> 01:45:34.261
MAP OUT AN OPTION FOR THE FIRST

01:45:34.327 --> 01:45:35.395
MILE OF GETTING TO PUBLIC

01:45:35.462 --> 01:45:37.597
TRANSIT, AND YOU CAN DO IT IN

01:45:37.664 --> 01:45:39.733
THE APP BY UTILIZING TRANSIT

01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:41.902
OPTION FOR TAKING AN UBER. AND

01:45:41.968 --> 01:45:43.670
THAT HAS BEEN REALLY IMPACTFUL

01:45:43.737 --> 01:45:46.206
NOT ONLY FOR INDIVIDUALS, BUT I

01:45:46.273 --> 01:45:47.974
THINK FOR CITIES WHEN THEY NEED

01:45:48.041 --> 01:45:48.942
TO RELY ON ADDITIONAL OPTIONS TO

01:45:49.009 --> 01:45:50.777
HELP PEOPLE UTILIZE PUBLIC

01:45:50.844 --> 01:45:53.080
TRANSIT. I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE.

01:45:53.146 --> 01:45:55.015
AS A SAN DIEGAN, I WAS IN SAN

01:45:55.082 --> 01:45:57.317
DIEGO FOR, WITH APOLOGIES TO

01:45:57.384 --> 01:45:58.652
ASSEMBLYMEMBER COLOSA AND HER LA

01:45:58.719 --> 01:46:01.221
STICKER, THE ONE OF THE BIGGEST

01:46:01.288 --> 01:46:02.989
EVENTS IN MY LIFE WAS WHEN WE

01:46:03.056 --> 01:46:04.091
BEAT THE DODGERS IN THE

01:46:04.157 --> 01:46:06.293
PLAYOFFS, RIGHT? AND WE WERE ALL

01:46:06.359 --> 01:46:07.394
IN PARTYING IN THE STREETS IN

01:46:07.461 --> 01:46:09.196
DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO. IT WAS A BIG

01:46:09.262 --> 01:46:10.464
DEAL FOR US PADRE FANS. AT ONE

01:46:10.530 --> 01:46:11.965
TIME, WE BEAT THE DODGERS, AND

01:46:12.032 --> 01:46:13.500
MANY OF US TOOK PUBLIC TRANSIT

01:46:13.567 --> 01:46:15.168
OUT TO THE STADIUM. BUT PUBLIC

01:46:15.235 --> 01:46:16.603
TRANSIT SERVICE ENDED AT

01:46:16.670 --> 01:46:17.671
MIDNIGHT. MANY, MANY PEOPLE WERE

01:46:17.738 --> 01:46:19.539
STILL DOWNTOWN AFTER PUBLIC

01:46:19.606 --> 01:46:20.640
TRANSIT SERVICE, AFTER THE

01:46:20.707 --> 01:46:22.476
TROLLEY HAD SHUT DOWN, AND OVER

01:46:22.542 --> 01:46:23.477
THE LOUDSPEAKER, PEOPLE WERE

01:46:23.543 --> 01:46:25.011
MAKING ANNOUNCEMENTS. IT'S TIME

01:46:25.078 --> 01:46:27.514
TO CALL YOUR UBER, TIME TO CALL

01:46:27.581 --> 01:46:28.648
YOUR LYFT. GET OUT OF DOWNTOWN.

01:46:28.715 --> 01:46:30.150
SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF HOW UBER

01:46:30.217 --> 01:46:31.485
AND LYFT TRANSPORTATION NETWORK

01:46:31.551 --> 01:46:33.253
COMPANIES COLLABORATE WITH

01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:35.155
TRANSIT, RIGHT? AND IF WE CAN

01:46:35.222 --> 01:46:35.789
KIND OF FORMALIZE THESE

01:46:35.856 --> 01:46:36.923
PARTNERSHIPS, THEN THAT'S EVEN

01:46:36.990 --> 01:46:38.992
BETTER. BUT IN IN THE MOMENT, IN

01:46:39.059 --> 01:46:40.794
REAL TIME, WHEN A CITY NEEDS TO

01:46:40.861 --> 01:46:42.629
CLEAR THIS, THIS IS A SOLUTION.

01:46:42.696 --> 01:46:44.064
AND TRANSIT CAN GET PEOPLE THERE

01:46:44.131 --> 01:46:46.833
AND TRANSIT IF IT CAN RUN ALL

01:46:46.900 --> 01:46:47.934
NIGHT, THAT'S GREAT. IF IT

01:46:48.001 --> 01:46:50.537
CAN'T, WE CAN HELP FILL THE GAP.

01:46:50.604 --> 01:46:53.373
AND THEN GOING BACK TO THE CLEAN

01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:55.442
MILE STANDARD PROGRAM THAT WE'VE

01:46:55.509 --> 01:46:57.844
TALKED ABOUT A LITTLE BIT, IT

01:46:57.911 --> 01:46:59.179
STARTED ITS IMPLEMENTATION LAST

01:46:59.246 --> 01:47:00.680
YEAR. CAN YOU CAN YOU EACH SPEAK

01:47:00.747 --> 01:47:02.182
TO A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:47:02.249 --> 01:47:03.083
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT HOW YOU'RE

01:47:03.150 --> 01:47:04.584
COMPLYING WITH THOSE REGULATIONS

01:47:04.651 --> 01:47:06.653
AND HELPING DRIVERS GET INTO

01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:09.322
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES? I'M

01:47:09.389 --> 01:47:11.424
HAPPY TO SPEAK FIRST ON BEHALF

01:47:11.491 --> 01:47:13.527
OF LYFT. LYFT IS VERY MUCH

01:47:13.593 --> 01:47:15.529
COMMITTED TO MEETING THE TARGETS

01:47:15.595 --> 01:47:17.497
THAT ARE OUTLINED IN THE CLEAN

01:47:17.564 --> 01:47:19.332
MILE STANDARD. WE HAVE RENTAL

01:47:19.399 --> 01:47:21.201
PARTNERS THAT WE WORK WITH TO

01:47:21.268 --> 01:47:23.970
HELP FACILITATE OUR DRIVERS

01:47:24.037 --> 01:47:26.473
GETTING INTO EVS WHEN THEY'RE ON

01:47:26.540 --> 01:47:28.108
OUR PLATFORM. WE ALSO HAVE WHAT

01:47:28.175 --> 01:47:30.110
IS KNOWN AS GREEN MODE, SO THAT

01:47:30.177 --> 01:47:31.444
AN INDIVIDUAL, WHEN THEY ARE

01:47:31.511 --> 01:47:32.579
REQUESTING A LYFT, THEY CAN

01:47:32.646 --> 01:47:33.980
SPECIFICALLY REQUEST TO RECEIVE

01:47:34.047 --> 01:47:38.151
A RIDE IN AN EV. AND IN ADDITION

01:47:38.218 --> 01:47:39.853
TO THAT, WE ALSO HAVE A

01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:41.254
PARTNERSHIP WITH EVGO CHARGING

01:47:41.321 --> 01:47:43.423
SO THAT WE CAN HELP PROVIDE

01:47:43.490 --> 01:47:45.225
CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR OUR

01:47:45.292 --> 01:47:46.660
DRIVERS SO THAT WHEN THEY ARE

01:47:46.726 --> 01:47:48.061
DRIVING ON OUR PLATFORM, THEY

01:47:48.128 --> 01:47:50.297
HAVE ACCESS TO LOW COST

01:47:50.363 --> 01:47:52.465
CHARGING. WE ALSO HAVE WHAT'S

01:47:52.532 --> 01:47:55.235
CALLED A TRIP RANGE, TRIP RANGE

01:47:55.302 --> 01:47:57.571
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. AND SO ONE OF

01:47:57.637 --> 01:47:58.605
THE BARRIERS THAT WE'VE SEEN

01:47:58.672 --> 01:48:00.307
WITH OUR DRIVERS IS THEIR FEAR

01:48:00.373 --> 01:48:01.775
OF GETTING ONTO THE LYFT

01:48:01.842 --> 01:48:03.577
PLATFORM AND RECEIVING A TRIP

01:48:03.643 --> 01:48:05.846
REQUEST THAT IS SEVERAL MILES

01:48:05.912 --> 01:48:07.647
AWAY, AND THEY FEAR THAT THEIR

01:48:07.714 --> 01:48:08.949
CHARGING WILL NOT LAST FOR THAT

01:48:09.015 --> 01:48:11.084
PARTICULAR TRIP. AND SO WHAT WE

01:48:11.151 --> 01:48:12.886
DO IS WE'VE COME UP WITH A

01:48:12.953 --> 01:48:14.721
SYSTEM WHERE WE IDENTIFY THE

01:48:14.788 --> 01:48:15.889
CHARGING RANGE OF THAT

01:48:15.956 --> 01:48:17.357
PARTICULAR VEHICLE, AND WE MATCH

01:48:17.424 --> 01:48:19.092
IT WITH THE TRIP REQUEST SO THAT

01:48:19.159 --> 01:48:20.393
DRIVERS FEEL CONFIDENT THAT WHEN

01:48:20.460 --> 01:48:22.329
THEY ACCEPT A TRIP, THAT THEY

01:48:22.395 --> 01:48:23.797
ARE ALSO ABLE TO COMPLETE THAT

01:48:23.864 --> 01:48:25.565
TRIP AND HAVE ENOUGH CHARGING ON

01:48:25.632 --> 01:48:27.767
THEIR VEHICLE. AND THEN LAST, WE

01:48:27.834 --> 01:48:29.502
ALSO PROVIDE BONUS INCENTIVES TO

01:48:29.569 --> 01:48:32.038
OUR DRIVERS TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO

01:48:32.105 --> 01:48:34.741
GET EVS AND TO PERFORM TRIPS ON

01:48:34.808 --> 01:48:38.178
OUR PLATFORM. THANK YOU. AND

01:48:38.245 --> 01:48:39.312
REALLY QUICKLY, MADAM CHAIR AND

01:48:39.379 --> 01:48:40.981
JOHN, I'M NOT GOING TO SPEAK TO

01:48:41.047 --> 01:48:42.883
YOUR COMMENT ABOUT THE DODGERS

01:48:42.949 --> 01:48:43.483
AND PADRES, AND I'M TRYING TO

01:48:43.550 --> 01:48:45.452
BITE MY TONGUE ON THAT GO

01:48:45.518 --> 01:48:51.157
DODGERS! EITHER WAY, GO, PADRES

01:48:51.224 --> 01:48:52.993
TO. SPEAKING OF HOW LYFT

01:48:53.059 --> 01:48:53.994
PROVIDES TRANSPORTATION SERVICE

01:48:54.060 --> 01:48:56.196
TO FOLKS TO GET TO PUBLIC

01:48:56.263 --> 01:48:57.297
TRANSIT, DON'T JUST HEAR IT FROM

01:48:57.364 --> 01:49:01.668
US. AS MENTIONED IN OUR PREVIOUS

01:49:01.735 --> 01:49:04.738
2024 ECONOMIC IMPACT REPORT,

01:49:04.804 --> 01:49:06.339
8,987% OF RIDERS SAY THAT LYFT

01:49:06.406 --> 01:49:07.707
INCREASES THEIR ACCESS TO

01:49:07.774 --> 01:49:08.475
TRANSPORTATION. SO I JUST WANTED

01:49:08.541 --> 01:49:10.610
TO PUT A FINER POINT ON THE

01:49:10.677 --> 01:49:11.878
PREVIOUS COMMENT I MADE, BUT

01:49:11.945 --> 01:49:13.880
I'LL KICK IT OVER TO DAVE. YEAH,

01:49:13.947 --> 01:49:15.615
SOMEWHAT SIMILARLY TO LYFT, WE

01:49:15.682 --> 01:49:17.717
PROVIDE THE GREEN PRODUCT UBER

01:49:17.784 --> 01:49:19.152
GREEN VERY SIMILAR TO THEIR

01:49:19.219 --> 01:49:23.189
GREEN MODE. AND IN THOSE

01:49:23.256 --> 01:49:24.157
PRODUCTS AND TRIPS REQUESTED,

01:49:24.224 --> 01:49:25.725
THERE ARE ADDITIONAL INCENTIVES

01:49:25.792 --> 01:49:27.861
PROVIDED TO DRIVERS TO MAKE TO

01:49:27.928 --> 01:49:29.596
MAKE THE SWITCH TO EVS MORE

01:49:29.663 --> 01:49:32.499
ECONOMICALLY VIABLE CURRENTLY.

01:49:32.565 --> 01:49:33.700
AND THIS NUMBER IS GETTING

01:49:33.767 --> 01:49:35.001
CLOSER AND CLOSER EVERY YEAR.

01:49:35.068 --> 01:49:36.603
BUT CURRENTLY, THE TOTAL COST OF

01:49:36.670 --> 01:49:38.338
OWNERSHIP OF AN EV STILL

01:49:38.405 --> 01:49:39.739
OUTPACES THE TOTAL COST OF

01:49:39.806 --> 01:49:41.574
OWNERSHIP OF AN INTERNAL

01:49:41.641 --> 01:49:43.443
COMBUSTION ENGINE, AND EVEN MORE

01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:46.179
SO OF A HYBRID VEHICLE. AND THIS

01:49:46.246 --> 01:49:47.414
RANGE ANXIETY THAT WAS MENTIONED

01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:51.584
BY SORRY, MISS WEAVER IS A VERY

01:49:51.651 --> 01:49:54.421
REAL THING. SO WE'VE ALSO

01:49:54.487 --> 01:49:57.324
PARTNERED WITH THE WITH WITH

01:49:57.390 --> 01:49:58.825
VARIOUS CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE

01:49:58.892 --> 01:50:00.193
COMPANIES DURING THE CÃC CART'S

01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:02.662
GRANT SPRINT SEVERAL YEARS AGO

01:50:02.729 --> 01:50:05.298
TO ACQUIRE SEVERAL OVER $10

01:50:05.365 --> 01:50:07.000
MILLION IN FUNDING, THAT THAT

01:50:07.067 --> 01:50:09.302
FUNDING DID GO TO THE CHARGING

01:50:09.369 --> 01:50:10.270
INFRASTRUCTURE COMPANIES. BUT WE

01:50:10.337 --> 01:50:11.738
PROVIDED DATA DURING THAT

01:50:11.805 --> 01:50:13.606
PROCESS TO SHOW THEM WHERE EV

01:50:13.673 --> 01:50:14.607
DEMAND IS GREATEST AND WHERE

01:50:14.674 --> 01:50:17.844
THOSE CHARGING THOSE CHARGING

01:50:17.911 --> 01:50:19.646
STATIONS WOULD BE MOST USEFUL.

01:50:19.713 --> 01:50:20.914
HERE'S SACRAMENTO, THERE'S ONE

01:50:20.981 --> 01:50:23.717
OF THEM, ACTUALLY. AND, YOU

01:50:23.783 --> 01:50:25.919
KNOW, I THINK THAT PRETTY MUCH

01:50:25.986 --> 01:50:27.787
WRAPS IT. THERE'S A LOT. AND I

01:50:27.854 --> 01:50:29.022
APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO

01:50:29.089 --> 01:50:30.724
SPEAK TO EVERY SINGLE THING THAT

01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:32.125
THAT WE DO, BUT THAT THAT

01:50:32.192 --> 01:50:35.962
GENERALLY WRAPS IT. OKAY. AND

01:50:36.029 --> 01:50:38.365
THEN SWITCHING A LITTLE GEARS, I

01:50:38.431 --> 01:50:39.733
WANT TO TALK ABOUT COMPETITION

01:50:39.799 --> 01:50:42.035
FROM AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES.

01:50:42.102 --> 01:50:43.403
AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES ARE A NEW

01:50:43.470 --> 01:50:45.238
CLASS OF TNCS THAT HAVE BEGUN

01:50:45.305 --> 01:50:47.040
EXPANDING ACROSS THE STATE. AND

01:50:47.107 --> 01:50:48.441
WHILE THEY FACE THEIR OWN

01:50:48.508 --> 01:50:49.909
ISSUES, MANY HAVE REPORTED

01:50:49.976 --> 01:50:51.678
POSITIVE EXPERIENCES. HOW HAS

01:50:51.745 --> 01:50:54.914
UBER AND LYFT POSITIONING ITSELF

01:50:54.981 --> 01:50:56.449
FROM A COMPETITIVE ANGLE

01:50:56.516 --> 01:51:00.387
COMPARED TO AVS? YEAH, I'M HAPPY

01:51:00.453 --> 01:51:02.522

01:51:02.589 --> 01:51:04.758
YOUR QUESTION. WELL, I'M NOT THE

01:51:04.824 --> 01:51:05.692
SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT ON

01:51:05.759 --> 01:51:06.626
AUTONOMOUS AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE

01:51:06.693 --> 01:51:08.228
WORK. AT THE POLICY LEVEL. I'M

01:51:08.294 --> 01:51:09.729
HAPPY TO READ A PREPARED

01:51:09.796 --> 01:51:11.164
STATEMENT WE HAVE REGARDING THAT

01:51:11.231 --> 01:51:14.067
DYNAMIC. SO AT LYFT, DRIVERS

01:51:14.134 --> 01:51:16.336
WILL ALWAYS HAVE A HAVE A PLACE

01:51:16.403 --> 01:51:19.439
ON THE LYFT PLATFORM. HARD STOP

01:51:19.506 --> 01:51:21.207
AS LYFT LOOKS TO THE FUTURE, AVS

01:51:21.274 --> 01:51:22.609
ARE REVOLUTIONIZING RIDESHARE BY

01:51:22.675 --> 01:51:24.277
OFFERING A SAFE AND ENGAGING AND

01:51:24.344 --> 01:51:25.545
INNOVATIVE TRANSPORTATION

01:51:25.612 --> 01:51:27.414
OPTION. LYFT ANTICIPATES A

01:51:27.480 --> 01:51:28.815
HYBRID KEYWORD HYBRID

01:51:28.882 --> 01:51:30.683
TRANSPORTATION NETWORK BY 2030,

01:51:30.750 --> 01:51:32.685
WHERE AVS AND HUMAN DRIVEN

01:51:32.752 --> 01:51:33.486
VEHICLES ARE INTEGRATED ON THE

01:51:33.553 --> 01:51:35.622
LYFT PLATFORM, AIMING TO CREATE

01:51:35.688 --> 01:51:37.490
HUMAN CENTRIC EXPERIENCES THAT

01:51:37.557 --> 01:51:40.293
CATER TO DIVERSE RIDERS NEEDS.

01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:41.961
FOR EXAMPLE, THIS SUMMER, LYFT

01:51:42.028 --> 01:51:43.463
IS LAUNCHING AVS ON ITS PLATFORM

01:51:43.530 --> 01:51:45.331
IN ATLANTA THROUGH OUR

01:51:45.398 --> 01:51:46.433
PARTNERSHIP WITH MAY MOBILITY,

01:51:46.499 --> 01:51:48.301
WHICH IS A CRUCIAL MILESTONE AND

01:51:48.368 --> 01:51:50.403
PLANS TO EXPAND TO CITIES LIKE

01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:52.872
DALLAS IN THE COMING YEAR.

01:51:52.939 --> 01:51:54.707
FURTHERMORE, OUR POWERFUL FLEET

01:51:54.774 --> 01:51:56.142
MANAGEMENT LIFTS CAPABILITY IN

01:51:56.209 --> 01:51:57.577
TERMS OF THE PRODUCT AND

01:51:57.644 --> 01:51:59.079
MARKETPLACE CAPABILITIES.

01:51:59.145 --> 01:52:00.413
POSITION US AS A PREFERRED

01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:02.649
PARTNER FOR EV FOR AV COMPANIES

01:52:02.715 --> 01:52:04.484
SEEKING TO SCALE AND

01:52:04.551 --> 01:52:05.919
COMMERCIALIZE THEIR TECHNOLOGY.

01:52:05.985 --> 01:52:07.687
AS AV TECHNOLOGY BECOMES MORE

01:52:07.754 --> 01:52:09.589
WIDELY AVAILABLE, LYFT AIMS TO

01:52:09.656 --> 01:52:12.192
ENSURE EVERY SELF-DRIVING CAR IS

01:52:12.258 --> 01:52:15.528
SEAMLESSLY INTEGRATED AND LYFT

01:52:15.595 --> 01:52:17.130
READY. AND JUST TO BUILD ON

01:52:17.197 --> 01:52:19.232
THAT, I THINK WE SECOND A LOT OF

01:52:19.299 --> 01:52:20.266
THOSE COMMENTS, BUT YOU'RE

01:52:20.333 --> 01:52:21.434
ACTUALLY HIGHLIGHTING SOMETHING

01:52:21.501 --> 01:52:22.836
THAT IS A COMPETITION, NOT JUST

01:52:22.902 --> 01:52:23.770
BETWEEN US AND AUTONOMOUS

01:52:23.837 --> 01:52:25.338
VEHICLE COMPANIES, BUT BETWEEN

01:52:25.405 --> 01:52:27.107
UBER AND LYFT AS WELL. THESE ARE

01:52:27.173 --> 01:52:28.575
ALL INDIVIDUAL PRIVATE COMPANIES

01:52:28.641 --> 01:52:30.343
COMPETING IN THIS MARKETPLACE,

01:52:30.410 --> 01:52:32.445
AND FOR US, OUR VISION IS

01:52:32.512 --> 01:52:33.746
WHATEVER WAY YOU WANT TO GET

01:52:33.813 --> 01:52:35.148
AROUND. YOU CAN DO SO ON THE

01:52:35.215 --> 01:52:37.517
UBER APP. SO A HYBRID APPROACH

01:52:37.584 --> 01:52:38.618
WHERE ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE

01:52:38.685 --> 01:52:40.186
AVAILABLE FOR YOU IS THE VISION

01:52:40.253 --> 01:52:42.055
THAT WE HAVE. AND WE RECOGNIZE

01:52:42.122 --> 01:52:43.957
THE EXCITEMENT THAT COMES WITH A

01:52:44.023 --> 01:52:45.558
NEW TECHNOLOGY. WE ARE A COMPANY

01:52:45.625 --> 01:52:46.659
THAT, AS WAS HIGHLIGHTED

01:52:46.726 --> 01:52:48.695
EARLIER, WAS ONCE AN UNKNOWN AND

01:52:48.761 --> 01:52:49.429
NEW TECHNOLOGY, AND THE

01:52:49.496 --> 01:52:50.730
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK ALLOWED FOR

01:52:50.797 --> 01:52:52.532
THAT TO GROW FROM RIGHT HERE IN

01:52:52.599 --> 01:52:53.766
CALIFORNIA. AND SO WE SUPPORT

01:52:53.833 --> 01:52:54.868
CONTINUED INNOVATION AND

01:52:54.934 --> 01:52:56.569
CONTINUED GROWTH. BUT HAVING

01:52:56.636 --> 01:52:58.104
THESE THESE TYPES OF RIDES

01:52:58.171 --> 01:52:59.873
AVAILABLE ON THE PLATFORM IS IN

01:52:59.939 --> 01:53:00.974
THE FUTURE IS SOMETHING THAT WE

01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:02.742
ARE LOOKING AT, AND THERE ARE

01:53:02.809 --> 01:53:03.576
CURRENT PARTNERSHIPS AVAILABLE.

01:53:03.643 --> 01:53:05.044
I DON'T BELIEVE THERE ARE ANY IN

01:53:05.111 --> 01:53:06.412
CALIFORNIA, BUT OUTSIDE OF

01:53:06.479 --> 01:53:08.214
CALIFORNIA, WE'VE BEGUN TO HAVE

01:53:08.281 --> 01:53:09.549
AUTONOMOUS RIDES ON THE

01:53:09.616 --> 01:53:11.017
PLATFORM. AND IN THE FUTURE,

01:53:11.084 --> 01:53:12.719
THOUGH, I THINK SOMETHING FOR

01:53:12.785 --> 01:53:13.486
THIS COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER IS

01:53:13.553 --> 01:53:16.422
THAT WE HAVE BEGUN, RIGHT.

01:53:16.489 --> 01:53:19.259
LEGISLATIVE PROGRAMS AND

01:53:19.325 --> 01:53:21.094
MANDATES THAT APPLY TO HUMAN

01:53:21.161 --> 01:53:22.762
DRIVEN RIDES THAT DON'T, THAT

01:53:22.829 --> 01:53:24.731
DON'T YET APPLY TO VARIOUS OTHER

01:53:24.797 --> 01:53:26.099
TYPES OF RIDES. RIGHT. SO

01:53:26.166 --> 01:53:27.600
WHENEVER WE'RE SETTING

01:53:27.667 --> 01:53:28.635
REGULATIONS, THE IMPORTANCE IS

01:53:28.701 --> 01:53:30.136
TO LOOK, LOOK TO THE FUTURE,

01:53:30.203 --> 01:53:31.504
GENERALLY SPEAKING. AND WE CAN'T

01:53:31.571 --> 01:53:32.939
ALWAYS ENVISION HOW THINGS WILL

01:53:33.006 --> 01:53:34.474
CHANGE AND GROW. AND SO THAT'S

01:53:34.541 --> 01:53:36.142
THAT'S THE NEED FOR ADOPTING AND

01:53:36.209 --> 01:53:37.443
THINKING ABOUT ABOUT NEW TYPES

01:53:37.510 --> 01:53:39.879
OF REGULATIONS. WE'LL GET THE

01:53:39.946 --> 01:53:43.750
POPCORN. AND THE LAST QUESTION

01:53:43.816 --> 01:53:46.653
IS AROUND DATA AND INSURANCE. SO

01:53:46.719 --> 01:53:50.290
THE TNC INDUSTRY HAS LOST TNC

01:53:50.356 --> 01:53:51.791
INDUSTRY HAS LAUNCHED A PUBLIC

01:53:51.858 --> 01:53:53.560
INFORMATION CAMPAIGN TO INFORM

01:53:53.626 --> 01:53:55.562
DRIVERS ABOUT HOW INSURANCE

01:53:55.628 --> 01:53:57.063
COSTS MIGHT BE RAISING THE COST

01:53:57.130 --> 01:54:00.400
OF TNC SERVICE. THERE IS ALSO A

01:54:00.466 --> 01:54:01.935
REPORT THAT WAS RECENTLY

01:54:02.001 --> 01:54:03.603
PUBLISHED ON THE TOPIC. DOES THE

01:54:03.670 --> 01:54:05.705
TNC INDUSTRY SHARE ANY

01:54:05.772 --> 01:54:07.540
INFORMATION WITH REGULATORS THAT

01:54:07.607 --> 01:54:10.476
MIGHT BE ABLE TO CONFIRM OR

01:54:10.543 --> 01:54:12.712
CORROBORATE THE FINDINGS OF THAT

01:54:12.779 --> 01:54:17.183
REPORT? SO IN THE ANNUAL REPORT,

01:54:17.250 --> 01:54:20.820
FARES DATA IS SHARED WITH THE

01:54:20.887 --> 01:54:23.823
CPUC, BUT SPECIFICALLY WITHIN

01:54:23.890 --> 01:54:25.592
THAT FARES DATA. I DON'T BELIEVE

01:54:25.658 --> 01:54:27.260
THERE'S A BREAKOUT OF WHAT

01:54:27.327 --> 01:54:29.862
PERCENTAGE IS PAID TO INSURANCE.

01:54:29.929 --> 01:54:31.631
THAT BEING SAID, THE BOOKING FEE

01:54:31.698 --> 01:54:33.266
ON UBER TRIPS, WHICH YOU CAN SEE

01:54:33.333 --> 01:54:35.868
ON YOUR RECEIPT, IS THE COST OF

01:54:35.935 --> 01:54:38.304
INSURANCE. SO IN MANY CASES,

01:54:38.371 --> 01:54:41.374
THIS CAN BE OVER 45% OF THE OF

01:54:41.441 --> 01:54:43.509
THE RIDER'S FARE, WHICH IS

01:54:43.576 --> 01:54:47.146
OBVIOUSLY NOT IDEAL FOR DRIVERS

01:54:47.213 --> 01:54:48.715
IN PARTICULAR, BECAUSE THAT'S

01:54:48.781 --> 01:54:50.049
EARNINGS THAT COULD BE IN THEIR

01:54:50.116 --> 01:54:52.185
POCKET OF COURSE FOR UBER AS

01:54:52.252 --> 01:54:53.620
WELL. AND THEN FOR RIDERS,

01:54:53.686 --> 01:54:55.488
RIGHT. PRICING PEOPLE OUT AND

01:54:55.555 --> 01:54:57.924
PEOPLE WHO MAY NEED THIS

01:54:57.991 --> 01:55:00.493
TRANSPORTATION. SO I DON'T

01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:02.262
BELIEVE THE CPUC OR OTHER

01:55:02.328 --> 01:55:03.630
GOVERNMENT ENTITIES IN

01:55:03.696 --> 01:55:05.498
CALIFORNIA WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE

01:55:05.565 --> 01:55:08.001
THAT DIRECT INSIGHT THROUGH THE

01:55:08.067 --> 01:55:10.136
DATA THAT IS CURRENTLY SHARED,

01:55:10.203 --> 01:55:13.806
BUT IT IS VISIBLE IN THE UBER

01:55:13.873 --> 01:55:17.410
APP FOR THE MOST PART. AS FAR AS

01:55:17.477 --> 01:55:19.879
LYFT'S RESPONSE, AS PART OF THE

01:55:19.946 --> 01:55:21.748
CPUC'S ANNUAL REPORT, ONE OF THE

01:55:21.814 --> 01:55:23.816
REPORTS THAT WE PROVIDE IS AN

01:55:23.883 --> 01:55:24.984
ACCIDENT INCIDENT REPORT, AND

01:55:25.051 --> 01:55:27.053
WITHIN THAT REPORT, WE PROVIDE

01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:30.056
DATA ON LOCATION OF A PARTICULAR

01:55:30.123 --> 01:55:31.124
INCIDENT, AND THAT INCLUDES

01:55:31.190 --> 01:55:32.592
CENSUS BLOCKS, CENSUS TRACK AND

01:55:32.659 --> 01:55:35.328
A ZIP CODE. AND THEN AS FAR AS

01:55:35.395 --> 01:55:37.196
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO

01:55:37.263 --> 01:55:38.931
ACCIDENTS, WE PROVIDE

01:55:38.998 --> 01:55:40.433
INFORMATION IN REGARDS TO

01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:42.168
PROCEEDINGS THAT ARE IN

01:55:42.235 --> 01:55:44.003
PROGRESS. AND THEN FOR FINANCIAL

01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:45.171
INFORMATION RELATED TO

01:55:45.238 --> 01:55:46.706
ACCIDENTS, WE DO PROVIDE TO THE

01:55:46.773 --> 01:55:49.475
CPUC THE AMOUNT PAID BY A TNC.

01:55:49.542 --> 01:55:51.311
AND THEN WE ALSO PROVIDE

01:55:51.377 --> 01:55:52.645
INFORMATION IN REGARDS TO THE

01:55:52.712 --> 01:55:54.580
COLLISION SEVERITY. THERE ARE

01:55:54.647 --> 01:55:55.915
OTHER DATA POINTS THAT ARE

01:55:55.982 --> 01:55:57.150
INCLUDED IN THAT REPORT THAT WE

01:55:57.216 --> 01:55:59.118
DO NOT PROVIDE TO THE CPUC,

01:55:59.185 --> 01:56:00.620
BECAUSE WE SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE

01:56:00.687 --> 01:56:02.355
THAT DATA AVAILABLE IN OUR

01:56:02.422 --> 01:56:04.123
SYSTEM AT THE TIME THAT THAT

01:56:04.190 --> 01:56:06.492
REPORT IS DUE TO THE CPUC. AS

01:56:06.559 --> 01:56:08.027
YOU KNOW, WHEN SOMEONE FILES AN

01:56:08.094 --> 01:56:09.896
INSURANCE CLAIM, IT'S A VERY

01:56:09.962 --> 01:56:12.432
ARDUOUS PROCESS TO WORK THAT

01:56:12.498 --> 01:56:14.233
CLAIM. AND YOU WORK THROUGH OUR

01:56:14.300 --> 01:56:16.469
INSURANCE PROVIDER. AND SO THE

01:56:16.536 --> 01:56:18.538
CPUC REQUIRES US TO REPORT ON AN

01:56:18.604 --> 01:56:20.006
ANNUAL BASIS INCIDENTS THAT

01:56:20.073 --> 01:56:21.908
OCCUR WITHIN THAT 12 MONTH

01:56:21.974 --> 01:56:23.242
PERIOD. AND SO A LOT OF

01:56:23.309 --> 01:56:24.410
INCIDENCES ARE STILL GOING

01:56:24.477 --> 01:56:26.546
THROUGH THAT CLAIMS PROCESS. AND

01:56:26.612 --> 01:56:28.681
SO WE DON'T HAVE INFORMATION

01:56:28.748 --> 01:56:31.651
RELATED TO THE INCIDENT PARTY,

01:56:31.718 --> 01:56:33.286
THE COURT FILE NUMBER, THE

01:56:33.353 --> 01:56:35.088
PROCEEDING STATUS, THE AMOUNT

01:56:35.154 --> 01:56:36.723
BEING PAID AND THE AMOUNT BEING

01:56:36.789 --> 01:56:38.324
PAID BY THE DRIVER'S INSURANCE

01:56:38.391 --> 01:56:40.626
BECAUSE OF THAT. AND THEN,

01:56:40.693 --> 01:56:42.061
MALCOLM, DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO

01:56:42.128 --> 01:56:43.129
ADD? NO, NOTHING FURTHER TO ADD.

01:56:43.196 --> 01:56:45.131
DO YOU SEPARATELY LIST OUT LIKE

01:56:45.198 --> 01:56:46.699
UBER DOES? THE BOOKING FEE,

01:56:46.766 --> 01:56:49.202
WHICH IS THE INSURANCE FEE ON

01:56:49.268 --> 01:56:50.903
LYFT? WE'RE ACTIVELY WORKING ON

01:56:50.970 --> 01:56:52.739
DOING THAT, MAKING THAT VISIBLE

01:56:52.805 --> 01:56:54.407
FOR RIDERS ON THE PLATFORM. SO

01:56:54.474 --> 01:56:57.043
HOW IS IT THE INSURANCE FEE

01:56:57.110 --> 01:56:58.911
CURRENTLY? THERE'S NO

01:56:58.978 --> 01:57:00.880
VISIBILITY. IF I WERE TO WRITE

01:57:00.947 --> 01:57:03.516
TAKE A LIFT SOMEWHERE, WHAT

01:57:03.583 --> 01:57:04.617
PERCENTAGE GOES TO INSURANCE

01:57:04.684 --> 01:57:05.752
VERSUS WHAT'S GOING TO THE

01:57:05.818 --> 01:57:08.254
DRIVER, ETC? YEAH, WE DON'T

01:57:08.321 --> 01:57:10.223
CURRENTLY BUCKET OUT AND I'M

01:57:10.289 --> 01:57:11.991
HAPPY TO GET BACK TO YOU KIND OF

01:57:12.058 --> 01:57:13.526
WITH EXACTLY HOW IT'S WHAT IT

01:57:13.593 --> 01:57:15.094
LOOKS LIKE. WE DON'T CURRENTLY

01:57:15.161 --> 01:57:16.295
BUCKET THAT OUT IN TERMS OF

01:57:16.362 --> 01:57:18.564
INSURANCE AT THIS TIME, BUT OUR

01:57:18.631 --> 01:57:19.565
TEAM IS ACTIVELY WORKING ON THAT.

01:57:19.632 --> 01:57:21.601
FOR WHATEVER IT'S WORTH, IT'S

01:57:21.667 --> 01:57:22.702
SIX BUCKS ON AVERAGE IN

01:57:22.769 --> 01:57:24.837
CALIFORNIA PER RIDE FOR

01:57:24.904 --> 01:57:26.205
INSURANCE ALONE, PLUS OTHER

01:57:26.272 --> 01:57:27.740
GOVERNMENT TAXES AND FEES,

01:57:27.807 --> 01:57:30.243
INCLUDING CMS ACCESS FOR ALL,

01:57:30.309 --> 01:57:34.380
ETC. IF I IF I MAY, MADAM CHAIR,

01:57:34.447 --> 01:57:35.281
THANK YOU. ALSO, I THINK YOU

01:57:35.348 --> 01:57:36.015
HIGHLIGHTED SOMETHING VERY

01:57:36.082 --> 01:57:37.850
IMPORTANT, WHICH IS NOT JUST

01:57:37.917 --> 01:57:39.218
TRANSPARENCY ON THE ON THE FEES

01:57:39.285 --> 01:57:41.020
TO THE RIDER, BUT ALSO TO THE

01:57:41.087 --> 01:57:42.221
DRIVER. RIGHT. THESE ARE THESE

01:57:42.288 --> 01:57:44.257
ARE EARNINGS THAT OTHERWISE A

01:57:44.323 --> 01:57:46.259
CUSTOMER PAYS. THE UBER DRIVER

01:57:46.325 --> 01:57:48.261
CAN ASK HEY HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY

01:57:48.327 --> 01:57:49.295
FOR THIS RIDE. AND THEN THEY

01:57:49.362 --> 01:57:51.230
ASSUME THAT THE DELTA THEY DON'T

01:57:51.297 --> 01:57:52.765
KNOW WHERE IT'S GOING. RIGHT.

01:57:52.832 --> 01:57:54.367
AND SO BREAKING THAT OUT FOR

01:57:54.434 --> 01:57:55.435
DRIVERS IN THEIR EARNINGS IS

01:57:55.501 --> 01:57:56.269
ALSO SOMETHING THAT WE'VE

01:57:56.335 --> 01:57:57.637
STARTED TO DO. AS THIS PROBLEM

01:57:57.703 --> 01:57:58.938
HAS GOTTEN WORSE IN CALIFORNIA

01:57:59.005 --> 01:58:00.706
OF INSURANCE COSTS REALLY

01:58:00.773 --> 01:58:03.009
DRIVING UP INCREASED INCREASED

01:58:03.075 --> 01:58:05.545
FARES ON RIDESHARE AND LETTING

01:58:05.611 --> 01:58:06.479
DRIVERS KNOW HOW MUCH OF MONEY

01:58:06.546 --> 01:58:08.347
THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE GOING TO

01:58:08.414 --> 01:58:09.482
THEIR EARNINGS IS GOING INSTEAD

01:58:09.549 --> 01:58:10.349
TO INSURANCE IS AN IMPORTANT

01:58:10.416 --> 01:58:12.552
PART OF THE EQUATION. IN

01:58:12.618 --> 01:58:14.187
ADDITION TO RIDER TRANSPARENCY

01:58:14.253 --> 01:58:16.789
TO THE RIDER ON HOW MUCH THEY

01:58:16.856 --> 01:58:20.193
PAID. OKAY, OTHER MEMBERS. YEAH.

01:58:20.259 --> 01:58:22.762
VICE CHAIR HOOVER. NOW YOU GUYS

01:58:22.829 --> 01:58:26.432
GOT ME THINKING. SO FIRST OF

01:58:26.499 --> 01:58:28.100
ALL, I'M ALWAYS HAPPY TO SEE THE

01:58:28.167 --> 01:58:30.336
PADRES AND THE DODGERS LOSE. BUT

01:58:30.403 --> 01:58:34.273
WE'LL SET THIS UP. I DID I DID

01:58:34.340 --> 01:58:36.209
WANT TO ASK KIND OF A FOLLOW UP

01:58:36.275 --> 01:58:38.511
ON THAT POINT. AND I THINK IT

01:58:38.578 --> 01:58:40.012
WAS A GREAT QUESTION ON THE

01:58:40.079 --> 01:58:41.180
INSURANCE PART. BUT I THINK MORE

01:58:41.247 --> 01:58:42.548
GENERALLY SPEAKING, YOU KNOW,

01:58:42.615 --> 01:58:44.116
ONE OF THE CONCERNS I HAVE IS

01:58:44.183 --> 01:58:45.918
SORT OF THE ONGOING COST

01:58:45.985 --> 01:58:48.054
INCREASE, RIGHT, OF A RIDE SHARE

01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:51.123
RIDE. SO, YOU KNOW, IN ADDITION

01:58:51.190 --> 01:58:52.758
TO INSURANCE, YOU KNOW, WHAT ARE

01:58:52.825 --> 01:58:54.961
SOME OF THE MAIN COST DRIVERS

01:58:55.027 --> 01:58:57.730
FOR YOUR FOR THE RIDES? AND ARE

01:58:57.797 --> 01:58:59.899
THERE ANY REGULATORY SORT OF

01:58:59.966 --> 01:59:01.267
RELIEF, RIGHT, THAT THE

01:59:01.334 --> 01:59:02.468
LEGISLATURE COULD PROVIDE TO

01:59:02.535 --> 01:59:03.870
HELP REDUCE SOME OF THOSE

01:59:03.936 --> 01:59:06.072
BARRIERS OR A LOT OF THEM, YOU

01:59:06.138 --> 01:59:06.772
KNOW, EXTERIOR, LIKE FOR

01:59:06.839 --> 01:59:07.840
EXAMPLE, RISING INSURANCE RATES

01:59:07.907 --> 01:59:10.376
AND THINGS LIKE THAT? YEAH.

01:59:10.443 --> 01:59:13.312
HAPPY TO JUMP IN. AND THANK YOU

01:59:13.379 --> 01:59:16.082
FOR YOUR QUESTION. GO, DODGERS.

01:59:16.148 --> 01:59:17.917
SO JUST JUST FOR BROADER

01:59:17.984 --> 01:59:20.419
CONTEXT, WE FULLY RECOGNIZE THAT

01:59:20.486 --> 01:59:21.487
THERE'S AN AFFORDABILITY ISSUE

01:59:21.554 --> 01:59:23.656
IN THIS PLACE WE ALL CALL HOME.

01:59:23.723 --> 01:59:24.624
LYFT HAS DEMONSTRATED ITS

01:59:24.690 --> 01:59:26.459
COMMITMENT TO IMPROVING DRIVER

01:59:26.526 --> 01:59:28.294
PAY AND HELPING DRIVERS KEEP

01:59:28.361 --> 01:59:30.162
DRIVERS SAFE THROUGH OUR

01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:32.198
EARNINGS GUARANTEE, WHICH WAS

01:59:32.265 --> 01:59:33.299
RECENTLY LAUNCHED. SO WE

01:59:33.366 --> 01:59:37.236
GUARANTEE THAT DRIVERS WILL EARN

01:59:37.303 --> 01:59:39.672
70% OR MORE OF RIDER PAYMENTS

01:59:39.739 --> 01:59:41.307
EACH WEEK. AND THIS IS AGAIN

01:59:41.374 --> 01:59:42.708
AFTER EXTERNAL TAXES AND FEES.

01:59:42.775 --> 01:59:44.510
THESE ARE LOCAL GOVERNMENT FEES,

01:59:44.577 --> 01:59:46.379
INSURANCE, ETC. AND COSTS

01:59:46.445 --> 01:59:48.581
INCLUDING INSURANCE INTO MADAM

01:59:48.648 --> 01:59:49.615
CHAIR'S POINT. WE'RE GOING TO

01:59:49.682 --> 01:59:52.051
BUCKET THAT OUT SO DRIVERS CAN

01:59:52.118 --> 01:59:52.818
SEE THAT VERY CLEARLY. AND YEAH,

01:59:52.885 --> 01:59:54.253
WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT, YOU

01:59:54.320 --> 01:59:56.656
KNOW, DRIVERS HAVE THE ABILITY

01:59:56.722 --> 01:59:58.224
TO NOT ONLY SEE THEIR EARNINGS,

01:59:58.291 --> 01:59:59.592
BUT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING IN

01:59:59.659 --> 02:00:02.261
OUR POWER TO ENSURE THAT DRIVERS

02:00:02.328 --> 02:00:03.963
ARE EQUITABLY PAID AGAIN THROUGH

02:00:04.030 --> 02:00:06.832
OUR EARNINGS GUARANTEE, WHICH IS

02:00:06.899 --> 02:00:09.702
AGAIN 70% TO THE DRIVER. AND OUR

02:00:09.769 --> 02:00:12.905
TAKE HOME IS ONLY 30% FULL

02:00:12.972 --> 02:00:13.673
TRANSPARENCY. IN CALIFORNIA,

02:00:13.739 --> 02:00:16.242
WE'RE ONLY TAKING ABOUT THREE

02:00:16.309 --> 02:00:20.112
BUCKS PER RIDE IN CALIFORNIA.

02:00:20.179 --> 02:00:21.914
YEAH. SO TO CLARIFY, THE

02:00:21.981 --> 02:00:23.482
QUESTION WAS WHAT OTHER THAN

02:00:23.549 --> 02:00:24.884
INSURANCE ARE THE PRIMARY COST

02:00:24.951 --> 02:00:25.885
DRIVERS OF TRIPS? YEAH. WHAT ARE

02:00:25.952 --> 02:00:27.386
YOUR GENERAL COST DRIVERS? I

02:00:27.453 --> 02:00:28.955
MEAN, YOU CAN INCLUDE INSURANCE

02:00:29.021 --> 02:00:30.256
IN THAT. BUT I THINK JUST

02:00:30.323 --> 02:00:31.357
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S ONE OF THEM.

02:00:31.424 --> 02:00:33.492
BUT YOU KNOW, OTHER OTHER COSTS

02:00:33.559 --> 02:00:35.194
AS WELL. YEAH. THANK YOU. THE

02:00:35.261 --> 02:00:36.729
SHORT ANSWER IS INSURANCE.

02:00:36.796 --> 02:00:39.966
RIGHT. THAT'S THAT'S IT. AND I

02:00:40.032 --> 02:00:42.468
DON'T KNOW IF LYFT IS IN THE

02:00:42.535 --> 02:00:44.370
EXACT SAME POSITION. BUT FOR

02:00:44.437 --> 02:00:46.806
UBER THAT IS THE PRIMARY COST

02:00:46.872 --> 02:00:48.708
DRIVER, ESPECIALLY RECENTLY,

02:00:48.774 --> 02:00:50.176
ESPECIALLY IN THE LARGER CITIES

02:00:50.242 --> 02:00:53.245
IN PARTICULAR LA. THAT BEING

02:00:53.312 --> 02:00:55.314
SAID, THERE ARE OTHER COST

02:00:55.381 --> 02:00:58.684
DRIVERS, LIKE THE VARIOUS FEE

02:00:58.751 --> 02:01:00.519
PER TRIP FEES THAT ARE LEVIED ON

02:01:00.586 --> 02:01:03.756
ON RIDESHARE RIDERS. BUT THESE

02:01:03.823 --> 02:01:04.657
THAT'S LIKE THE ACCESS FOR ALL

02:01:04.724 --> 02:01:06.492
FEAR THE STANDARD FEE. BUT THESE

02:01:06.559 --> 02:01:08.394
ARE PENNIES COMPARED TO

02:01:08.461 --> 02:01:10.896
INSURANCE AND FEES THAT, BY THE

02:01:10.963 --> 02:01:12.732
WAY, WE DON'T NECESSARILY

02:01:12.798 --> 02:01:14.100
DISAGREE WITH EITHER. THOSE ARE

02:01:14.166 --> 02:01:16.769
FOR A GOOD CAUSE AND FOR THE

02:01:16.836 --> 02:01:19.338
MOST PART, CERTAINLY WELCOME ON

02:01:19.405 --> 02:01:22.808
OUR APP. BEYOND THAT YOU'RE

02:01:22.875 --> 02:01:24.844
TALKING DRIVER EARNINGS DRIVER

02:01:24.910 --> 02:01:25.978
BENEFITS. BUT AGAIN THOSE ARE

02:01:26.045 --> 02:01:29.649
ALSO COSTS THAT WE SUPPORT. SO

02:01:29.715 --> 02:01:32.852
REALLY THE COST DRIVERS EXTEND

02:01:32.918 --> 02:01:34.654
BEYOND INSURANCE. BUT THE ONLY

02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:35.921
ONE THAT'S PARTICULARLY

02:01:35.988 --> 02:01:37.556
DIFFICULT TO MANAGE IS THAT OF

02:01:37.623 --> 02:01:39.425
INSURANCE I APPRECIATE THAT. AND

02:01:39.492 --> 02:01:41.560
THAT'S THAT'S REALLY HELPFUL TO

02:01:41.627 --> 02:01:43.062
KNOW OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW I THINK

02:01:43.129 --> 02:01:44.130
I THINK THE QUESTION EARLIER ON

02:01:44.196 --> 02:01:47.299
THE TRANSIT PIECE, YOU KNOW, I

02:01:47.366 --> 02:01:48.401
THINK THERE'S A LOT OF WAYS

02:01:48.467 --> 02:01:51.303
WHERE RIDESHARE TNCS AND TRANSIT

02:01:51.370 --> 02:01:52.605
CAN NOT ONLY COEXIST, BUT

02:01:52.672 --> 02:01:53.973
ACTUALLY SUPPORT ONE ANOTHER.

02:01:54.040 --> 02:01:56.275
YOU KNOW, IN A LOT OF WAYS I DO.

02:01:56.342 --> 02:01:58.577
I DO WORRY ABOUT THE, YOU KNOW,

02:01:58.644 --> 02:02:00.546
THE TEN MINUTE RIDE COSTING $20

02:02:00.613 --> 02:02:02.648
OR MORE, YOU KNOW, THAT SORT OF

02:02:02.715 --> 02:02:05.017
THING DEFINITELY MAKES IT HARDER

02:02:05.084 --> 02:02:06.952
FOR THOSE THINGS TO SORT OF

02:02:07.019 --> 02:02:09.655
INTERACT. SO I DO APPRECIATE

02:02:09.722 --> 02:02:13.092
THAT. AND I THINK THAT'S MY ONLY

02:02:13.159 --> 02:02:15.761
QUESTION FOR RIGHT NOW. OKAY.

02:02:15.828 --> 02:02:18.531
ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA, THEN

02:02:18.597 --> 02:02:20.066
ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARLOS, DID I

02:02:20.132 --> 02:02:21.967
SEE YOU HAD A QUESTION? NO.

02:02:22.034 --> 02:02:24.370
YEAH. OKAY. THANK YOU. CAN YOU

02:02:24.437 --> 02:02:26.906
SHARE A LITTLE BIT? JUST PROJECT

02:02:26.972 --> 02:02:31.544
OUT WHAT KIND OF SAVINGS? EACH

02:02:31.610 --> 02:02:35.181
COMPANY WOULD STAND TO HAVE IN

02:02:35.247 --> 02:02:38.617
THE EVENT OF A CONVERSION OF THE

02:02:38.684 --> 02:02:43.522
INSURANCE? FORMULA FIRST AND

02:02:43.589 --> 02:02:45.591
THEN SECOND? JUST GOING BACK TO

02:02:45.658 --> 02:02:47.359
THE COMMENT ABOUT THE

02:02:47.426 --> 02:02:49.862
INTERACTION OF AUTONOMOUS

02:02:49.929 --> 02:02:52.465
VEHICLES AND THE COMMITMENT TO

02:02:52.531 --> 02:02:54.166
ENSURE THAT DRIVERS THAT THERE

02:02:54.233 --> 02:02:55.968
ARE HUMAN DRIVERS STILL

02:02:56.035 --> 02:02:59.972
INVOLVED, HAVE YOU ALL PROVIDED

02:03:00.039 --> 02:03:03.876
ANY KIND OF A FORMULA FOR THE

02:03:03.943 --> 02:03:06.178
NUMBER OF DRIVERS RELATIVE TO

02:03:06.245 --> 02:03:08.914
THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES YOU

02:03:08.981 --> 02:03:11.283
INTEND TO HAVE OUT IN THE STATE

02:03:11.350 --> 02:03:13.052
OF CALIFORNIA? TO BE ABLE TO

02:03:13.119 --> 02:03:16.922
GIVE US A SENSE OF HOW MANY

02:03:16.989 --> 02:03:18.924
PEOPLE HUMANS WOULD ACTUALLY

02:03:18.991 --> 02:03:21.660
STILL ULTIMATELY BE INVOLVED IN

02:03:21.727 --> 02:03:23.462
YOUR PLATFORMS. I'LL GO AHEAD

02:03:23.529 --> 02:03:25.598
AND GO FIRST. I THINK YOUR

02:03:25.664 --> 02:03:26.565
SECOND QUESTION IS AN EXCELLENT

02:03:26.632 --> 02:03:27.867
ONE AND AN EXCELLENT FORWARD

02:03:27.933 --> 02:03:29.135
LOOKING QUESTION. I DON'T KNOW

02:03:29.201 --> 02:03:30.369
THAT I HAVE THAT ANSWER FOR YOU

02:03:30.436 --> 02:03:32.204
RIGHT NOW, BUT WE CAN WE CAN

02:03:32.271 --> 02:03:34.340
COMPILE SOME OF THAT INFORMATION

02:03:34.406 --> 02:03:35.241
AND GET BACK TO YOUR OFFICE. I

02:03:35.307 --> 02:03:37.143
THINK THAT'S A THAT'S A REALLY

02:03:37.209 --> 02:03:38.544
FORWARD LOOKING APPROACH YOU'RE

02:03:38.611 --> 02:03:39.945
TAKING THERE ON. AND I JUST

02:03:40.012 --> 02:03:40.846
DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE THERE

02:03:40.913 --> 02:03:42.081
QUITE YET. ON YOUR FIRST

02:03:42.148 --> 02:03:43.182
QUESTION OF INSURANCE SAVINGS,

02:03:43.249 --> 02:03:44.316
SINCE THAT'S LOOKING BACK, I DO

02:03:44.383 --> 02:03:47.586
HAVE THAT ANSWER IN OUR OUR

02:03:47.653 --> 02:03:49.255
PROPOSAL. I KNOW THIS IS AN

02:03:49.321 --> 02:03:51.490
INFORMATIONAL HEARING ABOUT CPUC

02:03:51.557 --> 02:03:52.258
REGULATIONS, BUT THERE IS AN

02:03:52.324 --> 02:03:54.059
ACTIVE PROPOSAL RIGHT NOW TO

02:03:54.126 --> 02:03:56.495
REFORM THAT SPECIFIC A SPECIFIC

02:03:56.562 --> 02:03:57.897
INSURANCE REQUIREMENT THAT IS

02:03:57.963 --> 02:03:59.732
DRIVING A LOT OF THESE COSTS.

02:03:59.799 --> 02:04:02.668
AND OUR ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT IF

02:04:02.735 --> 02:04:04.436
THAT REQUIREMENT, WHICH IS $1

02:04:04.503 --> 02:04:05.838
MILLION IN UNINSURED AND

02:04:05.905 --> 02:04:06.639
UNDERINSURED MOTORIST COVERAGE,

02:04:06.705 --> 02:04:08.808
IF THAT REQUIREMENT HAD BEEN

02:04:08.874 --> 02:04:10.609
LOWERED IN 2000, IN THE YEAR

02:04:10.676 --> 02:04:13.112
2024, THAT WE COULD HAVE SEEN

02:04:13.179 --> 02:04:14.980
$700 MILLION IN SAVINGS FOR

02:04:15.047 --> 02:04:15.548
CALIFORNIANS. SO THAT'S ALL

02:04:15.614 --> 02:04:17.416
MONEY COMING OUT OF CALIFORNIANS

02:04:17.483 --> 02:04:18.617
POCKETS. THAT IS NOT GOING TO

02:04:18.684 --> 02:04:20.352
THE DRIVER, THAT IS NOT GOING TO

02:04:20.419 --> 02:04:21.520
THE RIDESHARE COMPANY. IT'S

02:04:21.587 --> 02:04:23.088
GOING TO THIS BLACK HOLE OF

02:04:23.155 --> 02:04:25.324
INSURANCE. $700 MILLION IS

02:04:25.391 --> 02:04:26.725
PROBABLY A CONSERVATIVE

02:04:26.792 --> 02:04:28.360
ESTIMATE. IT'S IN THE HUNDREDS

02:04:28.427 --> 02:04:30.729
OF MILLIONS OF WHAT THIS COSTS

02:04:30.796 --> 02:04:32.498
CALIFORNIANS. AND IT'S ON A PER

02:04:32.565 --> 02:04:34.400
TRIP BASIS RIGHT. I MEAN LYFT

02:04:34.466 --> 02:04:36.135
ESTIMATED $6 PER TRIP FOR US.

02:04:36.202 --> 02:04:37.336
WE'RE DOING IT IN A PERCENTAGE

02:04:37.403 --> 02:04:38.971
WHERE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS

02:04:39.038 --> 02:04:41.240
THE WORST. IT'S NOW UP TO 45% OF

02:04:41.307 --> 02:04:42.641
A GIVEN RIDE GOING TOWARDS

02:04:42.708 --> 02:04:43.976
GOVERNMENT MANDATED INSURANCE

02:04:44.043 --> 02:04:45.077
COSTS. WE'VE SEEN THAT

02:04:45.144 --> 02:04:47.179
PARTICULAR POLICY BE THE PRIMARY

02:04:47.246 --> 02:04:48.714
COST DRIVER, BUT OVERALL

02:04:48.781 --> 02:04:50.149
INSURANCE WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY

02:04:50.216 --> 02:04:51.984
HIGHER THAN THAT 700 MILLION. SO

02:04:52.051 --> 02:04:54.820
THAT'S SAVINGS THAT COULD BE

02:04:54.887 --> 02:04:56.021
RECOUPED IF WE WERE TO ADDRESS

02:04:56.088 --> 02:04:59.558
THAT. JUST A FOLLOW UP. SO

02:04:59.625 --> 02:05:04.830
THERE'S THIS BASIC. CONCEPTUAL

02:05:04.897 --> 02:05:07.833
MODEL THAT IF WE ARE ABLE TO

02:05:07.900 --> 02:05:10.703
ALTER THE INSURANCE FORMULA, IT

02:05:10.769 --> 02:05:13.272
WOULD ALLOW FOR THERE TO BE

02:05:13.339 --> 02:05:14.907
SAVINGS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH

02:05:14.974 --> 02:05:19.011
RIDE. THAT WOULD ENABLE YOUR

02:05:19.078 --> 02:05:20.913
COMPANIES TO BE ABLE TO POUR

02:05:20.980 --> 02:05:23.616
MORE MONEY BACK INTO INDIVIDUAL

02:05:23.682 --> 02:05:26.785
RIDERS POCKETS, AS WELL AS TO BE

02:05:26.852 --> 02:05:30.856
ABLE TO CULTIVATE YOUR DRIVERS

02:05:30.923 --> 02:05:32.524
WHO ARE ON THE PLATFORM. SO I

02:05:32.591 --> 02:05:34.326
JUST DON'T WANT TO LOSE SIGHT OF

02:05:34.393 --> 02:05:35.861
THIS SECOND QUESTION THAT I

02:05:35.928 --> 02:05:37.429
ASKED, WHICH REALLY HAS TO DO

02:05:37.496 --> 02:05:39.131
WITH MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE

02:05:39.198 --> 02:05:41.967
STILL HAVING A CRITICAL MASS OF

02:05:42.034 --> 02:05:45.604
ACTUAL HUMAN DRIVERS WHO DEPEND

02:05:45.671 --> 02:05:49.275
ON ON YOUR PLATFORM IN ORDER TO

02:05:49.341 --> 02:05:52.011
BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THEMSELVES.

02:05:52.077 --> 02:05:54.280
SO I'M HOPING THAT YOU'VE DONE

02:05:54.346 --> 02:05:56.315
SOME MODELING AT SOME POINT

02:05:56.382 --> 02:05:58.183
AROUND AROUND THIS, AND PERHAPS

02:05:58.250 --> 02:06:00.753
LYFT HAS THERE AT UBER. THERE

02:06:00.819 --> 02:06:02.187
ARE EXPERTS IN THIS AREA. JOHN

02:06:02.254 --> 02:06:03.889
AND I ARE JUST NOT THOSE

02:06:03.956 --> 02:06:05.024
EXPERTS. AND WE CAN CERTAINLY

02:06:05.090 --> 02:06:06.959
GET BACK TO YOU ON THE ANSWER.

02:06:07.026 --> 02:06:08.327
AND THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT SOME

02:06:08.394 --> 02:06:09.662
FORM OF MODELING THAT THAT

02:06:09.728 --> 02:06:11.497
YOU'VE PROPOSED HAS OCCURRED.

02:06:11.563 --> 02:06:13.732
IT'S JUST NOT SOMETHING THAT I'M

02:06:13.799 --> 02:06:15.501
PRIVY TO AT THIS MOMENT. OKAY.

02:06:15.567 --> 02:06:17.369
YEAH. THANK YOU. SIMILARLY, AND

02:06:17.436 --> 02:06:19.705
THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTIONS. WE

02:06:19.772 --> 02:06:20.239
WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE

02:06:20.306 --> 02:06:21.674
ACCURATE. AND WE DO HAVE SUBJECT

02:06:21.740 --> 02:06:23.375
MATTER EXPERTS ON AUTONOMOUS

02:06:23.442 --> 02:06:25.477
VEHICLES. BUT TO YOUR BUT TO

02:06:25.544 --> 02:06:26.478
YOUR POINT, WE'RE ONLY MOVING AS

02:06:26.545 --> 02:06:28.013
FAST AS WE CAN FROM THE

02:06:28.080 --> 02:06:29.815
REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN TERMS

02:06:29.882 --> 02:06:30.649
OF HOW WE UNDERSTAND THE NUMBER

02:06:30.716 --> 02:06:32.484
OF AVS ALLOWED ON THE ROAD, WHEN

02:06:32.551 --> 02:06:34.353
THEY'RE GOING TO BE ALLOWED ON

02:06:34.420 --> 02:06:36.021
THE ROAD, AND WHAT THAT ACTUALLY

02:06:36.088 --> 02:06:37.156
LOOKS LIKE FROM A REGULATORY AND

02:06:37.222 --> 02:06:38.524
HOW THE STATE IS APPROACHING

02:06:38.590 --> 02:06:40.092
THAT. AND SO WE'LL BE HAPPY TO

02:06:40.159 --> 02:06:42.328
FOLLOW UP WITH YOU AFTER I

02:06:42.394 --> 02:06:43.796
CONFER WITH FOLKS ON MY TEAM

02:06:43.862 --> 02:06:44.997
INTERNALLY ABOUT THAT. AND THEN

02:06:45.064 --> 02:06:46.498
TO THE PREVIOUS QUESTION THAT

02:06:46.565 --> 02:06:49.001
YOU HAD, I WANT TO BE, AGAIN,

02:06:49.068 --> 02:06:50.035
ACCURATE AS WELL, SO I CAN

02:06:50.102 --> 02:06:52.271
FOLLOW UP WITH YOU IN WRITING

02:06:52.338 --> 02:06:54.039
WITH THAT, WITH THAT EXACT

02:06:54.106 --> 02:06:54.740
FIGURE, BUT JUST TO CONFIRM WITH

02:06:54.807 --> 02:06:56.141
YOU THAT ANY RESULTANT SAVINGS

02:06:56.208 --> 02:06:57.643
WOULD BE REINVESTED BACK INTO

02:06:57.710 --> 02:06:59.378
THE FINANCIAL BETTERMENT OF

02:06:59.445 --> 02:07:02.781
DRIVERS AND RIDERS RELATED TO

02:07:02.848 --> 02:07:06.986
INSURANCE. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

ADD ON TO WHAT MY COLLEAGUES

02:07:21.734 --> 02:07:24.937
MENTIONED, SOME OF THE ISSUES

02:07:25.004 --> 02:07:26.805
THAT I REALLY CARE ABOUT,

02:07:26.872 --> 02:07:27.506
REPRESENTING PARTS OF LOS

02:07:27.573 --> 02:07:30.275
ANGELES AND GLENDALE ARE ONE,

02:07:30.342 --> 02:07:32.811
OBVIOUSLY ENSURING THAT, AS

02:07:32.878 --> 02:07:34.380
ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA MENTIONED,

02:07:34.446 --> 02:07:37.282
WE RETAIN AND CONTINUE TO

02:07:37.349 --> 02:07:39.418
PROTECT THE JOBS THAT YOU ALL

02:07:39.485 --> 02:07:41.487
PROVIDE. YOU ARE ALL JOB MAKERS,

02:07:41.553 --> 02:07:43.589
JOB PROVIDERS, AND THAT'S SUPER

02:07:43.655 --> 02:07:46.759
IMPORTANT TO ME. AND I KNOW TO

02:07:46.825 --> 02:07:47.393

02:07:47.459 --> 02:07:50.329
WELL AS, YOU KNOW, THE BENEFITS

02:07:50.396 --> 02:07:52.531
AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE THAT YOU

02:07:52.598 --> 02:07:54.400
ALL ALLOW FOR WORKERS TO HAVE

02:07:54.466 --> 02:07:56.201
GIVEN THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE

02:07:56.268 --> 02:07:56.935
SCHEDULE. YOU KNOW, YOUR

02:07:57.002 --> 02:08:00.105
INDUSTRY HAS TRANSFORMED

02:08:00.172 --> 02:08:02.908
TRANSPORTATION, AND IT'S CRAZY

02:08:02.975 --> 02:08:03.876
TO THINK THAT IT'S ONLY BEEN

02:08:03.942 --> 02:08:05.944
AROUND FOR, WHAT, LESS THAN TWO

02:08:06.011 --> 02:08:07.312
DECADES. SO IF YOU TOLD ME 20

02:08:07.379 --> 02:08:09.048
YEARS AGO THAT I WOULD BE GOING

02:08:09.114 --> 02:08:10.949
INTO A STRANGER'S CAR TO GO TO

02:08:11.016 --> 02:08:12.317
DODGER STADIUM, I WOULD SAY

02:08:12.384 --> 02:08:15.254
YOU'RE CRAZY. BUT THAT'S HOW,

02:08:15.320 --> 02:08:16.622
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE GET AROUND

02:08:16.688 --> 02:08:19.224
NOWADAYS. AND SO, YOU KNOW, JUST

02:08:19.291 --> 02:08:21.060
WANT TO ALSO COMMEND ALL OF YOU

02:08:21.126 --> 02:08:22.561
ALL FOR THE GROWTH OF YOUR

02:08:22.628 --> 02:08:24.196
INDUSTRY THAT YOU'RE ALL SHAPING

02:08:24.263 --> 02:08:26.498
TOGETHER, ALONG WITH THE

02:08:26.565 --> 02:08:27.099
LEGISLATURE, THE CPUC AND ALL

02:08:27.166 --> 02:08:29.001
THE STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED. BUT I

02:08:29.068 --> 02:08:32.971
WANT TO JUST POINT TO THOSE TWO

02:08:33.038 --> 02:08:34.173
ISSUES AROUND THE WORKERS AND

02:08:34.239 --> 02:08:36.475
THE JOBS THAT THAT ARE REALLY

02:08:36.542 --> 02:08:38.077
IMPORTANT TO ME. AND THEN AROUND

02:08:38.143 --> 02:08:40.712
THE AFFORDABILITY PIECE THAT WAS

02:08:40.779 --> 02:08:43.715
ALREADY BEEN TOUCHED ON, JUST TO

02:08:43.782 --> 02:08:47.252
KIND OF ADD ON KIND OF RELATIVE

02:08:47.319 --> 02:08:49.321
TO YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE TALKED

02:08:49.388 --> 02:08:52.291
ABOUT INSURANCE A LOT ALREADY.

02:08:52.357 --> 02:08:53.859
CAN YOU JUST SHARE LIKE WHAT

02:08:53.926 --> 02:08:55.861
THAT LOOKS LIKE RELATIVE TO

02:08:55.928 --> 02:08:58.330
OTHER VEHICLES ON THE ROAD? CAN

02:08:58.397 --> 02:09:01.667
YOU JUST GIVE US AN ANALYSIS OF

02:09:01.733 --> 02:09:03.802
WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE? YOU KNOW,

02:09:03.869 --> 02:09:09.541
OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW, RIDESHARE.

02:09:09.608 --> 02:09:11.777
FOLKS WHO WHO ARE ON YOUR

02:09:11.844 --> 02:09:14.313
NETWORK, THEY USE THEIR OWN

02:09:14.379 --> 02:09:16.081
PERSONAL VEHICLES AND YOU ALSO

02:09:16.148 --> 02:09:17.616
RENT VEHICLES TO THEM. RIGHT? AM

02:09:17.683 --> 02:09:19.351
I UNDERSTANDING THAT CORRECTLY?

02:09:19.418 --> 02:09:21.120
SO RELATIVE TO OTHER FOLKS ON

02:09:21.186 --> 02:09:22.888
THE ROAD, WHAT DOES THAT LOOK

02:09:22.955 --> 02:09:24.923
LIKE AS IT RELATES TO INSURANCE?

02:09:24.990 --> 02:09:26.992
CAN YOU GIVE US A SNAPSHOT OF

02:09:27.059 --> 02:09:30.496
THAT? I'M SORRY, I DON'T THINK I

02:09:30.562 --> 02:09:31.597
WANT TO MAKE SURE I'M

02:09:31.663 --> 02:09:32.631
UNDERSTANDING YOUR QUESTION.

02:09:32.698 --> 02:09:34.166
YEAH. LET ME RESTATE IT. I GUESS

02:09:34.233 --> 02:09:35.868
I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

02:09:35.934 --> 02:09:37.002
RELATIVE INSURANCE WAS BROUGHT

02:09:37.069 --> 02:09:38.070
UP AS IT RELATES TO

02:09:38.137 --> 02:09:39.204
AFFORDABILITY, HOW THOSE COSTS

02:09:39.271 --> 02:09:42.341
ARE PASSED ON TO THE RIDER AND

02:09:42.407 --> 02:09:44.776
TO THE CONSUMER. ARE THOSE WHAT

02:09:44.843 --> 02:09:46.345
ARE THOSE INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS

02:09:46.411 --> 02:09:48.547
LIKE FOR RIDESHARE COMPANIES FOR

02:09:48.614 --> 02:09:49.915
TNCS RELATIVE TO OTHER DRIVERS

02:09:49.982 --> 02:09:51.350
ON THE ROAD? JUST SO YOU CAN

02:09:51.416 --> 02:09:55.320
GIVE US A SNAPSHOT OF WHAT THAT

02:09:55.387 --> 02:09:56.688
LOOKS LIKE RELATIVE TO OTHER

02:09:56.755 --> 02:09:58.857
DRIVERS? YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. AND

02:09:58.924 --> 02:10:00.392
JOHN, FEEL FREE TO JUMP IN ON

02:10:00.459 --> 02:10:02.594
THIS AS WELL. AND JUST TO AND

02:10:02.661 --> 02:10:03.529
THANK YOU FOR YOUR FOR YOUR FOR

02:10:03.595 --> 02:10:04.730
YOUR ENCOURAGING STATEMENT ABOUT

02:10:04.796 --> 02:10:06.231
HOW WE THINK ABOUT

02:10:06.298 --> 02:10:06.865
TRANSPORTATION MORE BROADLY AND

02:10:06.932 --> 02:10:08.634
JUST FOR, JUST FOR CLARITY OR

02:10:08.700 --> 02:10:11.203
CONTEXT. RATHER, IN 2024 FOR

02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:14.773
LYFT, SPECIFICALLY IN THIS ER ER

02:10:14.840 --> 02:10:17.342
REPORT THAT I MENTIONED, 90, 90%

02:10:17.409 --> 02:10:19.811
OF LYFT DRIVERS WORK OR EARN

02:10:19.878 --> 02:10:20.812
STUDENTS IN ADDITION TO APP

02:10:20.879 --> 02:10:22.414
BASED WORK. AND SO THESE ARE

02:10:22.481 --> 02:10:24.149
FOLKS WHO HAVE OTHER JOBS. THESE

02:10:24.216 --> 02:10:26.285
ARE FOLKS WHO GO TO SCHOOL,

02:10:26.351 --> 02:10:27.252
THESE ARE FOLKS WHO ARE

02:10:27.319 --> 02:10:28.887
CAREGIVERS, ETC. AS WELL. AND

02:10:28.954 --> 02:10:30.255
ABOUT 82% DRIVE LESS THAN 20

02:10:30.322 --> 02:10:31.857
HOURS A WEEK. SO THAT

02:10:31.924 --> 02:10:33.192
FLEXIBILITY AND THAT ABILITY TO

02:10:33.258 --> 02:10:34.927
WORK WHEN IT MAKES SENSE FOR

02:10:34.993 --> 02:10:36.061
THEM, THEIR FAMILIES, THEIR

02:10:36.128 --> 02:10:38.897
OTHER PRIORITIES ARE PARAMOUNT

02:10:38.964 --> 02:10:40.098
TO THIS, TO, TO, TO THEM. AND

02:10:40.165 --> 02:10:42.501
WE'RE HAPPY TO BE A PART OF THAT

02:10:42.568 --> 02:10:43.969
ECOSYSTEM FOR CALIFORNIANS. BUT

02:10:44.036 --> 02:10:46.438
AS IT RELATES TO INSURANCE, AS

02:10:46.505 --> 02:10:47.873
JOHN, AS JOHN MENTIONED, WHAT

02:10:47.940 --> 02:10:50.309
WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING TO IS

02:10:50.375 --> 02:10:52.144
RIGHTSIZE ONE SPECIFIC PART OF

02:10:52.211 --> 02:10:52.711
OUR INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS,

02:10:52.778 --> 02:10:54.279
WHICH IS UNINSURED AND

02:10:54.346 --> 02:10:56.782
UNDERINSURED MOTORIST INSURANCE.

02:10:56.848 --> 02:11:00.118
NO OTHER PRIVATE VEHICLE ON THE

02:11:00.185 --> 02:11:02.154
ON THE ROAD IS REQUIRED TO HAVE

02:11:02.221 --> 02:11:07.292
THAT INSURANCE JUST TNCS. IF I.

02:11:07.359 --> 02:11:09.428
YEAH, JUST JUST TO EXPAND ON IF

02:11:09.494 --> 02:11:12.030
I COULD JUST CHIME IN. I THINK

02:11:12.097 --> 02:11:13.765
YOU ASKED THE QUESTION ABOUT HOW

02:11:13.832 --> 02:11:17.836
DOES DÃ° TNCS INSURANCE COMPARE

02:11:17.903 --> 02:11:19.238
TO OTHER VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. I

02:11:19.304 --> 02:11:20.539
THINK IT'S PROBABLY APPROPRIATE

02:11:20.606 --> 02:11:21.740
FOR THIS CONVERSATION TO ALSO

02:11:21.807 --> 02:11:23.542
SAY IT'S NOT JUST PASSENGER

02:11:23.609 --> 02:11:25.677
VEHICLES, BUT OTHER CHARTER

02:11:25.744 --> 02:11:26.812
CARRIERS, BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:11:26.878 --> 02:11:29.248
REGULATED IN THAT CHARTER PARTY

02:11:29.314 --> 02:11:30.782
SPACE. SO IF YOU CAN DIRECT IT

02:11:30.849 --> 02:11:32.251
TOWARDS THAT AS WELL, I THINK

02:11:32.317 --> 02:11:34.019
THAT WOULD GIVE US A

02:11:34.086 --> 02:11:35.420
COMPREHENSIVE ANSWER. AND I

02:11:35.487 --> 02:11:37.556
DON'T HAVE TO ASK AGAIN, YOU

02:11:37.623 --> 02:11:38.657
KNOW. SURE, SURE. THANK YOU.

02:11:38.724 --> 02:11:40.192
HAPPY HAPPY TO JUMP IN ON THAT.

02:11:40.259 --> 02:11:42.127
SO WE ARE THE MOST INSURED

02:11:42.194 --> 02:11:44.062
VEHICLE ON THE ROAD PERIOD.

02:11:44.129 --> 02:11:45.097
COMPARED TO OTHER PERSONAL

02:11:45.163 --> 02:11:46.932
VEHICLES COMPARED TO OTHER OTHER

02:11:46.999 --> 02:11:49.001
FORMS OF TRANSPORTATION OF

02:11:49.067 --> 02:11:50.736
PASSENGERS. THE STATE'S MANDATES

02:11:50.802 --> 02:11:52.638
ON INSURANCE ARE SIGNIFICANTLY

02:11:52.704 --> 02:11:55.207
HIGH ON RIDESHARE, NOT JUST FOR

02:11:55.274 --> 02:11:57.075
ACCIDENTS WHERE WE OR THE UBER

02:11:57.142 --> 02:11:58.143
DRIVER OR RIDESHARE DRIVER

02:11:58.210 --> 02:11:59.811
RATHER WOULD BE AT FAULT. BUT

02:11:59.878 --> 02:12:01.613
FOR EVEN FOR INCIDENTS WHERE

02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:03.181
ANOTHER PARTY IS AT FAULT AND

02:12:03.248 --> 02:12:04.383
HITS A RIDESHARE VEHICLE, THAT

02:12:04.449 --> 02:12:06.451
WAS THE UNINSURED UNDERINSURED

02:12:06.518 --> 02:12:07.419
MOTORIST COVERAGE THAT I WAS

02:12:07.486 --> 02:12:09.955
REFERRING TO EARLIER. TO MY

02:12:10.022 --> 02:12:11.590
KNOWLEDGE, THERE IS NO OTHER

02:12:11.657 --> 02:12:13.625
REQUIREMENT FOR UIM IN THE STATE

02:12:13.692 --> 02:12:14.993
AT ALL PERSONAL VEHICLES. FOR

02:12:15.060 --> 02:12:17.229
ALL OF US DRIVING OUR CAR, IT IS

02:12:17.296 --> 02:12:19.131
UP TO US IF WE WANT TO PURCHASE

02:12:19.197 --> 02:12:20.299
THAT IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR

02:12:20.365 --> 02:12:22.768
ANYBODY WHO MAY BE UNINSURED OR

02:12:22.834 --> 02:12:23.969
MAY HAVE LESS INSURANCE THAN

02:12:24.036 --> 02:12:25.437
THAN IS AVAILABLE TO COVER THE

02:12:25.504 --> 02:12:27.539
ACCIDENTS THAT WE CAUSE. THE

02:12:27.606 --> 02:12:29.308
STATE RECENTLY INCREASED ITS

02:12:29.374 --> 02:12:31.143
MANDATORY MINIMUMS OF PERSONAL

02:12:31.209 --> 02:12:35.080
LIABILITY TO $30,000 PER PERSON,

02:12:35.147 --> 02:12:36.882
$60,000 PER ACCIDENT. OUR

02:12:36.948 --> 02:12:38.517
INSURANCE REQUIREMENT FOR

02:12:38.583 --> 02:12:41.753
RIDESHARE IS $1 MILLION FOR

02:12:41.820 --> 02:12:43.055
ANYBODY. AND SO IT'S

02:12:43.121 --> 02:12:44.523
DRAMATICALLY HIGHER THAN WHAT IS

02:12:44.589 --> 02:12:45.290
REQUIRED OF PERSONAL VEHICLES.

02:12:45.357 --> 02:12:46.992
THERE IS NO OTHER REQUIREMENT

02:12:47.059 --> 02:12:49.227
LIKE THAT ON ANY OTHER TYPE OF

02:12:49.294 --> 02:12:50.562
TRANSPORTATION FOR PASSENGERS

02:12:50.629 --> 02:12:52.664
EITHER. NOT SCHOOL BUSSES,

02:12:52.731 --> 02:12:54.533
LIMOUSINES, TAXIS. THERE ARE A

02:12:54.599 --> 02:12:57.102
FEW LOCAL REQUIREMENTS

02:12:57.169 --> 02:12:57.669
OCCASIONALLY THROUGHOUT THE

02:12:57.736 --> 02:12:59.438
STATE THAT I'M NOT FULLY AWARE

02:12:59.504 --> 02:13:01.139
OF, BUT TO MY TO MY KNOWLEDGE,

02:13:01.206 --> 02:13:02.574
THAT IS THE ONLY STATEWIDE

02:13:02.641 --> 02:13:03.675
MANDATE IS ACTUALLY ON

02:13:03.742 --> 02:13:04.776
RIDESHARE. SO THAT IS SOMETHING

02:13:04.843 --> 02:13:06.178
THAT WE SEE COULD BE ADDRESSED

02:13:06.244 --> 02:13:07.879
IF THE LEGISLATURE WANTED TO.

02:13:07.946 --> 02:13:09.348
BUT IT IS A SIGNIFICANT COST

02:13:09.414 --> 02:13:10.515
DRIVER, AS WE'VE SAID, AND IT'S

02:13:10.582 --> 02:13:13.685
ONLY ON OUR INDUSTRY. THANK YOU.

02:13:13.752 --> 02:13:15.387
AND ANY DATA POINTS THAT YOU CAN

02:13:15.454 --> 02:13:17.289
SHARE ON THAT WOULD BE SUPER

02:13:17.356 --> 02:13:19.124
HELPFUL. AND THE LAST POINT I

02:13:19.191 --> 02:13:21.326
JUST WANTED TO SAY IS ALSO TO

02:13:21.393 --> 02:13:23.428
THANK YOUR TEAMS FOR YOUR WORK

02:13:23.495 --> 02:13:25.497

SERVICE AT NO COST, SO THANK YOU

02:13:36.341 --> 02:13:38.210
FOR DOING THE RIGHT THING AND

02:13:38.276 --> 02:13:41.179
FOR DOING THAT. SO I JUST HAVE A

02:13:41.246 --> 02:13:42.247
CLARIFYING POINT. I WAS GOING TO

02:13:42.314 --> 02:13:43.982
ASK A QUESTION, BUT NOW I'M

02:13:44.049 --> 02:13:45.617
ASKED A QUESTION BECAUSE ME,

02:13:45.684 --> 02:13:51.590
IT'S YOU, I, YOU AND I KNOW YOU.

02:13:51.656 --> 02:13:52.457
UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED

02:13:52.524 --> 02:13:57.295
MOTORIST COVERAGE. YES. UIM, I

02:13:57.362 --> 02:13:58.330

02:13:58.397 --> 02:13:59.831
YEAR. ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S. OKAY.

02:13:59.898 --> 02:14:01.066

NOW, OKAY. IT'S FOREIGN TO YOU

02:14:17.115 --> 02:14:20.018
BECAUSE NO ONE ELSE IS REQUIRED

02:14:20.085 --> 02:14:20.619
TO HAVE INSURANCE. IT'S NOT

02:14:20.685 --> 02:14:22.020
FOREIGN TO ME. I JUST NEVER

02:14:22.087 --> 02:14:24.456
REMEMBER THE ACRONYM. AND WHAT

02:14:24.523 --> 02:14:26.792
YOU'RE SAYING IS LIMO DRIVERS,

02:14:26.858 --> 02:14:28.160
TAXIS, CHARTER PARTY BUSSES,

02:14:28.226 --> 02:14:29.828
NONE OF THEM ARE REQUIRED TO

02:14:29.895 --> 02:14:31.129
HAVE IT. THAT SPECIFIC

02:14:31.196 --> 02:14:32.664
REQUIREMENT. CORRECT. JUST JUST

02:14:32.731 --> 02:14:34.699
ARE THEY ARE THEY REQUIRED TO

HAVE. AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW THIS

02:14:37.135 --> 02:14:38.603
WE COULD ASK THE CPUC. THEY

02:14:38.670 --> 02:14:39.604
PROBABLY KNOW ARE THEY REQUIRED

02:14:39.671 --> 02:14:41.540
TO HAVE A DIFFERENT TYPE OF

02:14:41.606 --> 02:14:43.575
INSURANCE. BECAUSE ONE OF THE

02:14:43.642 --> 02:14:44.109
THINGS IS YOU'RE REGULATED

02:14:44.176 --> 02:14:46.144
DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE YOU'RE

02:14:46.211 --> 02:14:47.312
YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT LIKE A

02:14:47.379 --> 02:14:48.713
PERSONAL DRIVER, LIKE YOU'RE NOT

02:14:48.780 --> 02:14:50.549
A PERSONAL YOU'RE NOT A LIKE,

02:14:50.615 --> 02:14:52.317
IT'S NOT MY OWN CAR THAT I'M

02:14:52.384 --> 02:14:53.718
DRIVING AND I'M DRIVING MY

02:14:53.785 --> 02:14:55.220
FRIENDS OR FAMILY. RIGHT. YOU'RE

02:14:55.287 --> 02:14:57.022
PROVIDING A SERVICE. DO THEY ARE

02:14:57.088 --> 02:15:00.659
THOSE OTHER CARRIERS REQUIRED TO

02:15:00.725 --> 02:15:03.628
PROVIDE HAVE SOME OTHER TYPE OF

02:15:03.695 --> 02:15:04.963
INSURER INSURANCE? IF IT ISN'T,

02:15:05.030 --> 02:15:08.467
ARE YOU UIM INSURANCE I GOT IT,

02:15:08.533 --> 02:15:10.635
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. YES. SO I

02:15:10.702 --> 02:15:13.138
TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION ON UIM,

02:15:13.205 --> 02:15:14.940
WHICH IS ABOUT ACCIDENTS WHERE

02:15:15.006 --> 02:15:17.242
OUR DRIVERS ARE NOT AT FAULT,

02:15:17.309 --> 02:15:18.243
RIGHT. WHERE YOU'RE YOU'RE

02:15:18.310 --> 02:15:21.146
WRITING IN A, IN A TNC AND IT IS

02:15:21.213 --> 02:15:23.081
HIT BY A THIRD PARTY WHO EITHER

02:15:23.148 --> 02:15:25.150
HAS NO INSURANCE OR NOT ENOUGH

02:15:25.217 --> 02:15:26.284
INSURANCE TO COVER THE DAMAGE

02:15:26.351 --> 02:15:28.286
THAT THEY CAUSED. THERE IS NO

02:15:28.353 --> 02:15:30.088
OTHER FORM OF TRANSPORTATION

02:15:30.155 --> 02:15:31.923
THAT'S REQUIRED TO CARRY THAT.

02:15:31.990 --> 02:15:33.291
AND I THINK WE WOULD ARGUE THAT

02:15:33.358 --> 02:15:35.894
THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT RIDESHARE

02:15:35.961 --> 02:15:37.395
SPECIFICALLY THAT MANDATES THAT

02:15:37.462 --> 02:15:38.763
KIND OF COVERAGE, RIGHT, OF

02:15:38.830 --> 02:15:40.565
SOMEBODY ELSE HITTING HITTING

02:15:40.632 --> 02:15:41.666
THIS. IT'S JUST AS EASY FOR A

02:15:41.733 --> 02:15:44.102
THIRD PARTY WHO'S UNINSURED OR

02:15:44.169 --> 02:15:45.170
UNDERINSURED TO HIT A SCHOOL

02:15:45.237 --> 02:15:47.105
BUS, OR TO HIT A LIMOUSINE, OR

02:15:47.172 --> 02:15:49.074
TO HIT A SHUTTLE THAT'S CARRYING

02:15:49.140 --> 02:15:49.708
MULTIPLE PASSENGERS. RIGHT. BUT

02:15:49.774 --> 02:15:51.610
THE STATE HAS NOT MANDATED THAT

02:15:51.676 --> 02:15:52.677
ON THOSE FORMS OF

02:15:52.744 --> 02:15:54.145
TRANSPORTATION, TRANSPORTATION,

02:15:54.212 --> 02:15:55.714
SIMPLY BECAUSE IT HASN'T

02:15:55.780 --> 02:15:57.148
MANDATED THAT THIS WAS THIS WAS

02:15:57.215 --> 02:15:58.683
JUST PART OF THE LEGISLATION

02:15:58.750 --> 02:16:00.051
THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN TALKING

02:16:00.118 --> 02:16:01.019
ABOUT THAT CREATED THE

02:16:01.086 --> 02:16:03.288
REGULATORY SCHEME FOR RIDESHARE

02:16:03.355 --> 02:16:05.090
ABOUT 12 YEARS AGO NOW. SO I

02:16:05.156 --> 02:16:06.525
DON'T THINK WE'VE HAD THE

02:16:06.591 --> 02:16:07.359
CONVERSATION ABOUT RIGHTSIZING

02:16:07.425 --> 02:16:09.261
IT YET BECAUSE WE SIMPLY WEREN'T

02:16:09.327 --> 02:16:10.595
AWARE OF HOW MUCH IT COST. UNTIL

02:16:10.662 --> 02:16:12.197
RECENTLY, WE'VE BEEN SEEING THE

02:16:12.264 --> 02:16:14.766
COST. THE COST GO UP. AND TO

02:16:14.833 --> 02:16:17.702
FOLLOW UP ON WHETHER WE SHOULD

02:16:17.769 --> 02:16:19.804
REQUIRE OTHER, OTHER TYPES OF

02:16:19.871 --> 02:16:20.906
TRANSPORTATION, DO HAVE OTHER

02:16:20.972 --> 02:16:22.741
FORMS OF INSURANCE THAT THEY'RE

02:16:22.807 --> 02:16:23.808
REQUIRED TO CARRY. LIKE MOSTLY

02:16:23.875 --> 02:16:26.645
IT IS PERSONAL. IT IS LIABILITY

02:16:26.711 --> 02:16:28.079
INSURANCE FOR WHEN THAT DRIVER

02:16:28.146 --> 02:16:29.915
IS ACTUALLY AT FAULT CAUSING AN

02:16:29.981 --> 02:16:31.283
ACCIDENT. AND WE THINK WE

02:16:31.349 --> 02:16:32.117
ABSOLUTELY SHOULD CARRY THAT, BY

02:16:32.183 --> 02:16:34.252
THE WAY. AND WE WOULD FOR ANY

02:16:34.319 --> 02:16:35.554
PROPOSALS THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY

02:16:35.620 --> 02:16:37.522
CONSIDERING, WE WOULD STILL

02:16:37.589 --> 02:16:38.557
REMAIN THE MOST INSURED VEHICLE

02:16:38.623 --> 02:16:44.362
ON THE ROAD BY FAR. OKAY. I WANT

02:16:44.429 --> 02:16:45.497
TO THANK ALL OUR PANELISTS FOR

02:16:45.564 --> 02:16:48.600
YOUR THOROUGH ANSWERS. AND WITH

02:16:48.667 --> 02:16:50.101
THAT, WE'RE GOING TO GO ON TO

02:16:50.168 --> 02:16:52.938
PANEL THREE, UNDERSTANDING THE

02:16:53.004 --> 02:16:55.540
IMPACT OF TNC OPERATIONS IN

02:16:55.607 --> 02:16:56.875

BECAME A PARTY TO THAT

02:18:22.594 --> 02:18:23.995
RULEMAKING PROCEEDING. BUT THERE

02:18:24.062 --> 02:18:26.231
WAS ALSO AN URGENCY TO

02:18:26.297 --> 02:18:27.132
UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACTS OF

02:18:27.198 --> 02:18:29.200
TNCS IN SAN FRANCISCO. SO WE

02:18:29.267 --> 02:18:30.802
PARTNERED WITH ACADEMIC DATA

02:18:30.869 --> 02:18:32.671
SCIENTISTS TO GAIN ACCESS TO A

02:18:32.737 --> 02:18:34.639
ONE TIME ONLY HIGHLY DETAILED

02:18:34.706 --> 02:18:37.375
SET OF TNC TRIP DATA FROM THE

02:18:37.442 --> 02:18:41.413
FALL OF 2016. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.

02:18:41.479 --> 02:18:43.048
WITH THAT DATA, WE DEVELOPED A

02:18:43.114 --> 02:18:44.816
PROFILE OF TNC ACTIVITY IN SAN

02:18:44.883 --> 02:18:46.851
FRANCISCO AND BUILT UPON IT TO

02:18:46.918 --> 02:18:48.153
ESTIMATE THE IMPACTS TO

02:18:48.219 --> 02:18:50.889
CONGESTION AND TO TRANSIT

02:18:50.955 --> 02:18:51.456
RIDERSHIP. STUDIES WERE PEER

02:18:51.523 --> 02:18:51.990
REVIEWED AND PUBLISHED IN

02:18:52.057 --> 02:18:54.492
ACADEMIC JOURNALS. THE FINDINGS

02:18:54.559 --> 02:18:55.994
WERE SIGNIFICANT. NEXT SLIDE

02:18:56.061 --> 02:18:59.597
PLEASE. BETWEEN 2010 AND 2015,

02:18:59.664 --> 02:19:01.800
WE ESTIMATED THAT TNCS LED TO A

02:19:01.866 --> 02:19:02.934
10% LOSS IN TRANSIT RIDERSHIP IN

02:19:03.001 --> 02:19:05.336
SAN FRANCISCO, OFFSETTING THE

02:19:05.403 --> 02:19:06.538
GAINS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE SEEN

02:19:06.604 --> 02:19:08.873
FROM A GROWING POPULATION AND

02:19:08.940 --> 02:19:10.075
ECONOMY, AND INCREASED TRANSIT

02:19:10.141 --> 02:19:12.644
SERVICE. AT THE SAME TIME, WE

02:19:12.711 --> 02:19:15.447
ALSO ESTIMATED THE TNCS CAUSED

02:19:15.513 --> 02:19:17.615
HALF OF THE INCREASE IN

02:19:17.682 --> 02:19:19.050
CONGESTION, WITH THE OTHER HALF

02:19:19.117 --> 02:19:21.586
COMING FROM AN INCREASE IN

02:19:21.653 --> 02:19:24.556
POPULATION AND JOBS. THIS WORK

02:19:24.622 --> 02:19:25.490
LED THE CITY TO CREATE THE

02:19:25.557 --> 02:19:27.158
TRAFFIC CONGESTION MITIGATION

02:19:27.225 --> 02:19:28.426
TAX, APPROVED BY SAN FRANCISCO

02:19:28.493 --> 02:19:32.330
VOTERS IN 2019. THIS IS A 3.25%

02:19:32.397 --> 02:19:34.632
TAX ON MOST FARES, AND HAS

02:19:34.699 --> 02:19:36.701
AMOUNTED TO ABOUT 8 MILLION PER

02:19:36.768 --> 02:19:38.536
YEAR IN REVENUES OVER THE LAST

02:19:38.603 --> 02:19:40.638
THREE YEARS. THE TRANSPORTATION

02:19:40.705 --> 02:19:42.207
AUTHORITY AND THE SFMTA USE

02:19:42.273 --> 02:19:44.642
THESE FUNDS TO IMPROVE ROAD

02:19:44.709 --> 02:19:45.310
SAFETY AND MUNI TRANSIT SERVICES

02:19:45.376 --> 02:19:49.981
IN SAN FRANCISCO. IN 2020, THE

02:19:50.048 --> 02:19:51.416
COMMISSION MADE A MOMENTOUS

02:19:51.483 --> 02:19:52.884
DECISION TO REVERSE ITS RULES,

02:19:52.951 --> 02:19:54.753
PRESUMING CONFIDENTIALITY FOR

02:19:54.819 --> 02:19:56.855
TNC ANNUAL REPORTS. INSTEAD.

02:19:56.921 --> 02:19:57.722
PRESUMING THAT THESE REPORTS

02:19:57.789 --> 02:20:00.091
WOULD BE PUBLIC, THIS SHIFT

02:20:00.158 --> 02:20:01.459
ACKNOWLEDGED THE NEEDS OF

02:20:01.526 --> 02:20:02.994
CITIES, RESEARCHERS AND THE

02:20:03.061 --> 02:20:05.096
PUBLIC AT LARGE IN BETTER

02:20:05.163 --> 02:20:07.398
UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACTS OF

02:20:07.465 --> 02:20:10.101
TNCS TO OUR TRANSPORTATION

02:20:10.168 --> 02:20:11.536
SYSTEMS. LATER THAT YEAR, THE

02:20:11.603 --> 02:20:13.772
COMMISSION RULED THAT THE TNC

02:20:13.838 --> 02:20:15.740
ANNUAL REPORTS FOR 2020 WOULD

02:20:15.807 --> 02:20:17.108
NOT JUST BE PRESUMED PUBLIC, BUT

02:20:17.175 --> 02:20:19.477
WERE IN FACT PUBLIC. WITH NARROW

02:20:19.544 --> 02:20:22.413
EXCEPTIONS. THE TRANSPORTATION

02:20:22.480 --> 02:20:23.815
AUTHORITY REQUESTED THESE

02:20:23.882 --> 02:20:25.183
REPORTS. THAT REQUEST WAS

02:20:25.250 --> 02:20:27.018
TREATED AS A PUBLIC RECORDS ACT

02:20:27.085 --> 02:20:28.520
REQUEST, AND RESULTED IN THE

02:20:28.586 --> 02:20:30.688
RELEASE OF THE 2020 ANNUAL

02:20:30.755 --> 02:20:33.558
REPORTS FOR UBER AND LYFT.

02:20:33.625 --> 02:20:36.427
UBER'S REPORTS WERE LARGELY

02:20:36.494 --> 02:20:37.128
COMPLETE, HOWEVER, LIFTS WERE

02:20:37.195 --> 02:20:41.099
ALMOST ENTIRELY REDACTED. NEXT

02:20:41.166 --> 02:20:45.670
SLIDE AND NEXT SLIDE. OH YES,

02:20:45.737 --> 02:20:47.739
THIS ONE. THANK YOU. USING THAT

02:20:47.806 --> 02:20:50.175
DATA, WE PUBLISHED THE TNCS 2020

02:20:50.241 --> 02:20:51.142
REPORT, WHICH REVEALED, AMONG

02:20:51.209 --> 02:20:53.011
OTHER THINGS, THAT UBER AND LYFT

02:20:53.077 --> 02:20:54.212
TRIPS ARE HIGHLY CONCENTRATED IN

02:20:54.279 --> 02:20:57.749
SAN FRANCISCO, 500 TIMES MORE

02:20:57.816 --> 02:20:59.184
TRIPS PER SQUARE MILE THAN THE

02:20:59.250 --> 02:21:00.985
REST OF CALIFORNIA, FOLLOWED BY

02:21:01.052 --> 02:21:02.787
LOS ANGELES AND SAN DIEGO

02:21:02.854 --> 02:21:04.088
COUNTIES. THOSE THREE COUNTIES

02:21:04.155 --> 02:21:06.157
COLLECTIVELY ACCOUNT FOR TWO

02:21:06.224 --> 02:21:08.860
THIRDS OF ALL TNC TRIPS IN THE

02:21:08.927 --> 02:21:10.328
STATE. THE FOLLOWING YEAR. IN

02:21:10.395 --> 02:21:12.263
2021, THE COMMISSION RULED THAT

02:21:12.330 --> 02:21:14.199
THE 2021 ANNUAL REPORTS WERE

02:21:14.265 --> 02:21:16.734
ALSO PUBLIC, WITH NARROW

02:21:16.801 --> 02:21:17.936
EXCEPTIONS CONSISTENT WITH THEIR

02:21:18.002 --> 02:21:21.306
2020 RULING. EARLIER THIS YEAR,

02:21:21.372 --> 02:21:23.208
THE COMMISSION UPHELD AN EARLIER

02:21:23.274 --> 02:21:24.676
DECISION THAT THE ANNUAL REPORTS

02:21:24.742 --> 02:21:28.246
FROM 2014 TO 2019 SHOULD ALSO BE

02:21:28.313 --> 02:21:30.081
PUBLIC. LYFT HAS CHALLENGED

02:21:30.148 --> 02:21:31.549
THESE RULINGS IN A PROCESS WHICH

02:21:31.616 --> 02:21:33.318
HAS DRAGGED ON FOR YEARS, BUT

02:21:33.384 --> 02:21:34.552
LYFT IS NOW EXHAUSTED. MOST OF

02:21:34.619 --> 02:21:35.887
THESE CHALLENGES, AND THE

02:21:35.954 --> 02:21:37.222
COMMISSION HAS UPHELD THEIR

02:21:37.288 --> 02:21:39.424
RULINGS. LYFT EXHAUSTED THEIR

02:21:39.490 --> 02:21:41.392
CHALLENGES TO THE 2020 AND 2021

02:21:41.459 --> 02:21:44.829
ANNUAL REPORTS YEARS AGO.

02:21:44.896 --> 02:21:46.631
HOWEVER, DESPITE THE CLEAR,

02:21:46.698 --> 02:21:47.699
CONSISTENT AND REAFFIRMING

02:21:47.765 --> 02:21:49.834
RULINGS AND DECISIONS OF THE

02:21:49.901 --> 02:21:52.437
COMMISSION OVER THE LAST FIVE

02:21:52.503 --> 02:21:54.105
YEARS, EXPLICITLY DESIGNATING

02:21:54.172 --> 02:21:55.673
EIGHT OF THE 11 ANNUAL REPORTS

02:21:55.740 --> 02:21:57.842
SUBMITTED SO FAR, ONLY ONE

02:21:57.909 --> 02:21:59.344
YEAR'S WORTH OF TNC REPORTS HAVE

02:21:59.410 --> 02:22:00.678
BEEN PUBLISHED BY THE

02:22:00.745 --> 02:22:02.447
COMMISSION. IF YOU GO TO THE

02:22:02.513 --> 02:22:03.948
DATA PORTAL TODAY, YOU WILL ONLY

02:22:04.015 --> 02:22:05.750
FIND THE 2021 TNC ANNUAL

02:22:05.817 --> 02:22:07.185
REPORTS, AND THEY ARE HEAVILY

02:22:07.252 --> 02:22:08.586
REDACTED, IN CLEAR CONTRADICTION

02:22:08.653 --> 02:22:10.622
TO THE STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY

02:22:10.688 --> 02:22:12.557
THE RULEMAKING. AND THEY'RE ONLY

02:22:12.624 --> 02:22:14.325
AVAILABLE FOR UBER, UBER, AND

02:22:14.392 --> 02:22:15.960
LYFT, AND NOT FOR THE EIGHT

02:22:16.027 --> 02:22:18.062
OTHER TNCS WHOSE REPORTS HAVE

02:22:18.129 --> 02:22:19.764
BEEN LISTED AS FORTHCOMING SINCE

02:22:19.831 --> 02:22:22.700
2023. AS THE COMMISSION'S ROLE

02:22:22.767 --> 02:22:24.335
HAS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE

02:22:24.402 --> 02:22:26.237
AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE PASSENGER

02:22:26.304 --> 02:22:27.605
SERVICES, THEY HAVE ADOPTED

02:22:27.672 --> 02:22:28.973
SIMILAR REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

02:22:29.040 --> 02:22:30.541
AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE

02:22:30.608 --> 02:22:32.710
PRESUMPTIONS. IN CONTRAST TO

02:22:32.777 --> 02:22:34.212
TNCS, THESE REPORTS ARE

02:22:34.279 --> 02:22:36.147
REGULARLY PUBLISHED, BUT JUST AS

02:22:36.214 --> 02:22:38.316
WITH TNCS, THEY ARE HIGHLY

02:22:38.383 --> 02:22:40.218
REDACTED. CONFIDENTIALITY CLAIMS

02:22:40.285 --> 02:22:41.719
FIRST MADE BY WAYMO WHEN THEY

02:22:41.786 --> 02:22:43.588
FILED THEIR FIRST QUARTERLY

02:22:43.655 --> 02:22:46.791
REPORTS IN 2022, ARE STILL

02:22:46.858 --> 02:22:47.792
LISTED ON THE DATA PORTAL AS

02:22:47.859 --> 02:22:51.262
UNDER REVIEW. SINCE THEN, WAYMO

02:22:51.329 --> 02:22:52.830
HAS GONE FROM REPORTING ABOUT

02:22:52.897 --> 02:22:55.500
4000 TRIPS PER MONTH IN 2022 TO

02:22:55.566 --> 02:22:58.303
OVER 700,000 TRIPS PER MONTH IN

02:22:58.369 --> 02:22:59.671
2025 ACROSS THE STATE OF

02:22:59.737 --> 02:23:02.173
CALIFORNIA. DUE TO THE WAY THESE

02:23:02.240 --> 02:23:04.242
REPORTS ARE REDACTED, WE CANNOT

02:23:04.309 --> 02:23:05.443
SAY HOW MANY OF THESE TRIPS ARE

02:23:05.510 --> 02:23:07.312
HAPPENING IN SAN FRANCISCO. THE

02:23:07.378 --> 02:23:09.047
LACK OF TIMELY AND COMPLETE

02:23:09.113 --> 02:23:11.282
DISCLOSURE LEAVES US IN THE

02:23:11.349 --> 02:23:12.317
PUBLIC UNCLEAR ABOUT HOW TO

02:23:12.383 --> 02:23:14.185
ANALYZE THE RAPID INCREASE IN

02:23:14.252 --> 02:23:15.853
OPERATIONS, TO GAUGE

02:23:15.920 --> 02:23:17.255
PERFORMANCE, AND TO GAUGE

02:23:17.322 --> 02:23:19.023
PERFORMANCE OF AV PASSENGER

02:23:19.090 --> 02:23:21.359
SERVICES. OUR RESEARCH

02:23:21.426 --> 02:23:23.895
EXPERIENCE INFORMS US THAT TNCS

02:23:23.962 --> 02:23:25.296
HAVE LOCAL IMPACTS TO OUR

02:23:25.363 --> 02:23:27.198
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM, AND

02:23:27.265 --> 02:23:28.232
SUGGEST THAT AVS MAY HAVE SOME

02:23:28.299 --> 02:23:31.636
OF THE SAME IMPACTS. HOWEVER,

02:23:31.703 --> 02:23:33.604
OUR UNDERSTANDING IS FROZEN IN

02:23:33.671 --> 02:23:35.406
TIME AS THE PANDEMIC HAS UPENDED

02:23:35.473 --> 02:23:37.141
THE TNC INDUSTRY AND AV

02:23:37.208 --> 02:23:38.810
PASSENGER SERVICES HAVE

02:23:38.876 --> 02:23:41.546
CONTINUALLY EXPANDED OPERATIONS.

02:23:41.612 --> 02:23:42.747
THE COMMISSION HAS ACKNOWLEDGED

02:23:42.814 --> 02:23:44.415
THE VALUE OF THIS DATA FOR

02:23:44.482 --> 02:23:45.450
SERVING THE PLANNING NEEDS OF

02:23:45.516 --> 02:23:47.618
LOCAL OFFICIALS, AND THESE DATA

02:23:47.685 --> 02:23:49.053
ARE ALSO NEEDED BY RESEARCHERS

02:23:49.120 --> 02:23:51.189
AND REGULATORS TO INFORM POLICY

02:23:51.255 --> 02:23:52.857
DEVELOPMENT AND OVERSIGHT OF

02:23:52.924 --> 02:23:53.825
THIS IMPORTANT AND RAPIDLY

02:23:53.891 --> 02:23:56.227
GROWING SECTOR. IT IS THEREFORE

02:23:56.294 --> 02:23:57.562
CRITICAL THAT THE COMMISSION

02:23:57.628 --> 02:23:59.330
TAKE STEPS TO ENSURE THE TIMELY

02:23:59.397 --> 02:24:00.431
RELEASE OF DATA THAT HAS ALREADY

02:24:00.498 --> 02:24:03.501
DETERMINED TO BE PUBLIC

02:24:03.568 --> 02:24:04.135
TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY

02:24:04.202 --> 02:24:07.005
UNDERPIN PUBLIC TRUST AND

02:24:07.071 --> 02:24:08.506
CONFIDENCE IN THE INDUSTRY, AND

02:24:08.573 --> 02:24:10.274
CALIFORNIA HAS THE ABILITY TO

02:24:10.341 --> 02:24:12.010
CONTINUE TO LEAD IN DEVELOPMENT

02:24:12.076 --> 02:24:15.980
OF NEW MOBILITY SERVICES WHILE

02:24:16.047 --> 02:24:17.482
UPHOLDING THE PUBLIC INTEREST

02:24:17.548 --> 02:24:18.950
THROUGH EFFECTIVE REGULATION.

02:24:19.017 --> 02:24:20.251
THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY

02:24:20.318 --> 02:24:22.987

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, AS

02:24:52.550 --> 02:24:55.286
WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA RESILIENT

02:24:55.353 --> 02:24:56.220
INNOVATIVE MOBILITY INITIATIVE,

02:24:56.287 --> 02:24:58.089
WHICH IS FUNDED BY THE

02:24:58.156 --> 02:24:58.656
LEGISLATURE. AND WE'RE VERY

02:24:58.723 --> 02:25:00.024
GRATEFUL FOR THAT FUNDING TO

SUPPORT THE WORK THAT WE DO,

02:25:02.260 --> 02:25:03.194
INCLUDING THE EVALUATIONS

02:25:03.261 --> 02:25:06.497
RELATED TO TNCS. I'M HERE TO

02:25:07.965 --> 02:25:09.967
THE IMPACT OF TNC OPERATIONS AND

02:25:10.034 --> 02:25:11.836
INSIGHTS FROM THE DATA AND

02:25:11.903 --> 02:25:12.937
SUPPORTIVE DATA DESIGNS THAT WE

02:25:13.004 --> 02:25:15.239
WOULD BELIEVE WOULD BE USEFUL

02:25:15.306 --> 02:25:19.010
FOR RESEARCH. NEXT SLIDE. SO TO

02:25:19.077 --> 02:25:20.711
BEGIN, TNCS DO PLAY A PROMINENT

02:25:20.778 --> 02:25:22.580
ROLE IN OUR TRANSPORTATION

02:25:22.647 --> 02:25:23.848
SYSTEM, PROVIDING MOBILITY TO

02:25:23.915 --> 02:25:25.883
URBAN, SUBURBAN AND RURAL AREAS.

02:25:25.950 --> 02:25:26.951
AND BECAUSE OF THEIR LARGE ROLE

02:25:27.018 --> 02:25:28.753
IN THE STATE AND NATION, THEIR

02:25:28.820 --> 02:25:30.288
MEASUREMENT OF IMPACTS IS

02:25:30.354 --> 02:25:32.390
SIMILARLY IMPORTANT. TNCS HAVE

02:25:32.457 --> 02:25:33.791
IMPACTS ON VEHICLE MILES

02:25:33.858 --> 02:25:35.493
TRAVELED, AIR AND GHG GREENHOUSE

02:25:35.560 --> 02:25:38.429
GAS EMISSIONS, USER MOBILITY AND

02:25:38.496 --> 02:25:39.964
ACCESSIBILITY, DRIVER INCOME AND

02:25:40.031 --> 02:25:41.699
LIVELIHOOD CONGESTION, TRAVEL

02:25:41.766 --> 02:25:43.267
SAFETY, LABOR MARKETS AND OTHER

02:25:43.334 --> 02:25:45.236
KEY SECTORS OF THE STATE,

02:25:45.303 --> 02:25:49.640
ECONOMY AND SOCIETY. NEXT SLIDE.

02:25:49.707 --> 02:25:51.042
MEASURING IMPACTS OF TNCS

02:25:51.109 --> 02:25:52.643
REQUIRE MULTIPLE TYPES OF DATA

02:25:52.710 --> 02:25:54.245
THAT ARE USED TOGETHER THAT

02:25:54.312 --> 02:25:56.080
INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO,

02:25:56.147 --> 02:25:57.248
SURVEY DATA DESCRIBING THE

02:25:57.315 --> 02:25:58.649
TRAVEL BEHAVIOR AND AUTO

02:25:58.716 --> 02:26:00.418
OWNERSHIP OF TNC USERS AND

02:26:00.485 --> 02:26:02.620
DRIVERS. TRIP ACTIVITY DATA

02:26:02.687 --> 02:26:04.422
CATALOGING THE TRIPS THAT USERS

02:26:04.489 --> 02:26:07.258
MAKE USING TNC SERVICES, AS WELL

02:26:07.325 --> 02:26:09.360
AS TNC FLEET MIX DATA

02:26:09.427 --> 02:26:10.428
DELINEATING THE VEHICLES THAT

02:26:10.495 --> 02:26:13.698
ARE DELIVERING THE TNC SERVICES.

02:26:13.764 --> 02:26:16.934
NEXT SLIDE. THERE ARE MANY

02:26:17.001 --> 02:26:19.871
EXAMPLES OF RESEARCH THAT HAS

02:26:19.937 --> 02:26:22.807
EVALUATED THE IMPACTS OF TNCS IN

02:26:22.874 --> 02:26:24.842
CALIFORNIA AND BEYOND. THIS IS

02:26:24.909 --> 02:26:26.377
ONE EXAMPLE OF OUTPUTS FROM SUCH

02:26:26.444 --> 02:26:27.812
RESEARCH COMBINING MULTIPLE DATA

02:26:27.879 --> 02:26:30.381
SETS. THIS RESEARCH EVALUATED

02:26:30.448 --> 02:26:33.551
THE IMPACT WHERE WHERE TNCS WERE

02:26:33.618 --> 02:26:34.952
CONTRIBUTING TO NET GHG

02:26:35.019 --> 02:26:36.387
EMISSIONS WITHIN THREE MAJOR

02:26:36.454 --> 02:26:37.522
METROPOLITAN MARKETS LOS

02:26:37.588 --> 02:26:39.323
ANGELES, SAN FRANCISCO, AND

02:26:39.390 --> 02:26:42.160
WASHINGTON, D.C. IT PUT TOGETHER

02:26:42.226 --> 02:26:43.227
IMPACTS THAT WERE ASSESSED FROM

02:26:43.294 --> 02:26:44.662
BEHAVIORAL CHANGE PER PASSENGER

02:26:44.729 --> 02:26:46.898
PER YEAR, AS WELL AS OPERATOR

02:26:46.964 --> 02:26:48.666
GHG EMISSIONS PER PASSENGER PER

02:26:48.733 --> 02:26:50.201
VEHICLE YEAR. TAKING THOSE TWO

02:26:50.268 --> 02:26:52.603
DATA SETS COMBINED AND THOSE

02:26:52.670 --> 02:26:54.672
VALUES, WE WERE ABLE TO ASSESS

02:26:54.739 --> 02:26:57.608
THAT TNCS HAD INCREASED GHG

02:26:57.675 --> 02:26:59.043
EMISSIONS IN THE METROPOLITAN

02:26:59.110 --> 02:27:00.912
AREAS OF LOS ANGELES AND SAN

02:27:00.978 --> 02:27:03.080
FRANCISCO, BUT HAD DECREASED GHG

02:27:03.147 --> 02:27:05.983
EMISSIONS ON A ON A NET BASIS IN

02:27:06.050 --> 02:27:07.385
WASHINGTON, D.C. THIS IS ONE

02:27:07.451 --> 02:27:09.086
EXAMPLE OF HOW WE USE RESEARCH

02:27:09.153 --> 02:27:12.056
AND DATA FROM BOTH OPERATORS AND

02:27:12.123 --> 02:27:15.259
FROM SURVEYS OF USERS TO MAKE AN

02:27:15.326 --> 02:27:17.395
ASSESSMENT OF HOW THE OVERALL

02:27:17.461 --> 02:27:20.364
EFFECT OF GHG EMISSIONS ARE

02:27:20.431 --> 02:27:22.400
CHANGING AS A RESULT OF TNC

02:27:22.466 --> 02:27:25.036
OPERATIONS. NEXT SLIDE. AS

02:27:25.102 --> 02:27:26.837
ANOTHER EXAMPLE, WE CAN LOOK

02:27:26.904 --> 02:27:28.606
MORE DEEPLY INTO THE SUBJECT

02:27:28.673 --> 02:27:30.775
MATTER OF TNC. ELECTRIFICATION

02:27:30.841 --> 02:27:32.276
RESEARCH CAN SHOW US THE

02:27:32.343 --> 02:27:33.644
FINANCIAL PATHWAYS AND OPERATING

02:27:33.711 --> 02:27:34.745
CONDITIONS THROUGH WHICH TNC

02:27:34.812 --> 02:27:36.847
DRIVERS CAN ACQUIRE ELECTRIC

02:27:36.914 --> 02:27:38.382
VEHICLES. HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF A

02:27:38.449 --> 02:27:40.918
MATRIX OF DECISIONS THAT SHOW

02:27:40.985 --> 02:27:43.387
WHAT ARE THE DOMINANT PATHWAYS

02:27:43.454 --> 02:27:45.122
FOR SELECTING A VEHICLE.

02:27:45.189 --> 02:27:46.924
DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH A DRIVER

02:27:46.991 --> 02:27:48.926
DRIVES, AND ALSO HOW LONG

02:27:48.993 --> 02:27:50.595
THEY'VE BEEN DRIVING, WHETHER

02:27:50.661 --> 02:27:51.796
WHAT THEIR BEST DECISION WOULD

02:27:51.862 --> 02:27:54.198
BE FOR ACQUIRING AN ICE OR AN

02:27:54.265 --> 02:27:56.033
INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE

02:27:56.100 --> 02:27:58.803
VERSUS AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE. AND

02:27:58.869 --> 02:28:01.405
THIS DATA DIRECTLY USES TRIP

02:28:01.472 --> 02:28:03.608
ACTIVITY DATA THAT IS BASED ON

02:28:03.674 --> 02:28:09.447
ON TNC TRAVEL. NEXT SLIDE. BUT

02:28:09.513 --> 02:28:11.882
THERE ARE ISSUES WITH TNC DATA.

02:28:11.949 --> 02:28:13.651
USEFUL DATA WAS PROVIDED BY

02:28:13.718 --> 02:28:14.919
OPERATORS FOR THE GHG STUDY, BUT

02:28:14.986 --> 02:28:16.387
IT WAS AGGREGATED AND AVERAGED

02:28:16.454 --> 02:28:17.922
OVER THE POPULATION. MORE

02:28:17.989 --> 02:28:20.124
DETAILED QUESTIONS REQUIRE TRIP

02:28:20.191 --> 02:28:21.926
ACTIVITY DATA OF GREATER

02:28:21.993 --> 02:28:23.394
PRECISION, BUT THERE ARE

02:28:23.461 --> 02:28:25.463
CONCERNS WITH PII, PERSONALLY

02:28:25.529 --> 02:28:26.364
IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION AND

02:28:26.430 --> 02:28:28.366
TRADE SECRETS AND HAVE PREVENTED

02:28:28.432 --> 02:28:30.301
THE DATA WITH THIS RESOLUTION

02:28:30.368 --> 02:28:31.669
FROM BEING MORE READILY

02:28:31.736 --> 02:28:33.804
ACCESSIBLE. A SIMPLIFIED DATA

02:28:33.871 --> 02:28:35.273
STRUCTURE THAT I MIGHT SHOW HERE

02:28:35.339 --> 02:28:37.742
IS JUST A SHOWS, FOR EXAMPLE, OF

02:28:37.808 --> 02:28:39.877
TRIP ACTIVITY DATA THAT IS

02:28:39.944 --> 02:28:42.847
DE-IDENTIFIED PASSENGER ID,

02:28:42.913 --> 02:28:44.282
DE-IDENTIFIED VEHICLE ID, TRIP

02:28:44.348 --> 02:28:46.017
REQUEST TIME, TRIP START TIME,

02:28:46.083 --> 02:28:48.119
TRIP END TIME ORIGIN DESTINATION

02:28:48.185 --> 02:28:49.654
IN THE FORM OF A LATITUDE AND

02:28:49.720 --> 02:28:50.755
LONGITUDE DESTINATION IN THE

02:28:50.821 --> 02:28:52.189
FORM OF A LATITUDE AND

02:28:52.256 --> 02:28:53.424
LONGITUDE, AS WELL AS TRIP COST.

02:28:53.491 --> 02:28:55.426
THIS IS A VERY SIMPLIFIED DATA

02:28:55.493 --> 02:28:56.527
STRUCTURE THAT WOULD BE VERY

02:28:56.594 --> 02:28:58.262
USEFUL FOR ANSWERING A LOT OF

02:28:58.329 --> 02:28:59.697
POLICY RELATED QUESTIONS WITH

02:28:59.764 --> 02:29:02.566
REGARDS TO TNC OPERATIONS. NEXT

02:29:02.633 --> 02:29:05.636
SLIDE WITH REGARDS TO TNC DATA

02:29:05.703 --> 02:29:07.305
THAT ARE AVAILABLE THAT ARE

PUBLICLY AVAILABLE TODAY HAS

02:29:08.105 --> 02:29:10.074
BEEN MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY.

02:29:10.141 --> 02:29:11.609
DURING THIS SESSION, THE

02:29:11.676 --> 02:29:13.010
CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES

02:29:13.077 --> 02:29:14.912
COMMISSION HAS PUBLISHED TRIP

02:29:14.979 --> 02:29:16.714
ACTIVITY DATA OF TNCS FOR THE

02:29:16.781 --> 02:29:19.483
YEAR 2021. MUCH OF THIS GENERAL

02:29:19.550 --> 02:29:20.918
STRUCTURE OF THE DATA ARE

02:29:20.985 --> 02:29:22.353
CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE WOULD

02:29:22.420 --> 02:29:24.488
NEED FOR SOCIAL AND ENERGY

02:29:24.555 --> 02:29:25.990
ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS, BUT

02:29:26.057 --> 02:29:27.992
THESE DATA ARE HEAVILY REDACTED.

02:29:28.059 --> 02:29:29.560
IN SOME CASES, THE DATA POSTED

02:29:29.627 --> 02:29:32.763
IS SIMPLY 40GB OF THE WORD

02:29:32.830 --> 02:29:36.901
REDACTED. NEXT SLIDE. THERE ARE

02:29:36.967 --> 02:29:38.769
A NUMBER OF CONCERNS LEGITIMATE

02:29:38.836 --> 02:29:40.671
CONCERNS HOSTING THIS DATA TO

02:29:40.738 --> 02:29:42.740
THE PUBLIC. NUMBER ONE IS

02:29:42.807 --> 02:29:43.808
COMPROMISING PERSONALLY

02:29:43.874 --> 02:29:45.643
IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION,

02:29:45.710 --> 02:29:47.111
PRECISE DATA ON TIME AND

02:29:47.178 --> 02:29:48.179
LOCATION OF TRAVEL COULD

02:29:48.245 --> 02:29:50.281
POTENTIALLY IDENTIFY A USER,

02:29:50.348 --> 02:29:51.615
EVEN IF A NAME IS NOT INCLUDED

02:29:51.682 --> 02:29:54.418
IN THE DATA. NUMBER TWO,

02:29:54.485 --> 02:29:55.820
EXPOSING USABLE MARKET DATA SUCH

02:29:55.886 --> 02:29:57.755
AS TRADE SECRET OR OTHERWISE

02:29:57.822 --> 02:29:59.423
CALLED TRADE SECRETS TO

02:29:59.490 --> 02:30:00.791
COMPETITORS. THE SAME DATA THAT

02:30:00.858 --> 02:30:02.660
IS USEFUL FOR RESEARCHERS TO

02:30:02.727 --> 02:30:03.994
ANSWER IMPORTANT POLICY

02:30:04.061 --> 02:30:05.830
QUESTIONS WOULD ALSO BE USEFUL

02:30:05.896 --> 02:30:07.198
TO COMPETITORS TO UNDERSTAND

02:30:07.264 --> 02:30:09.066
OPERATIONS AND DEVELOP COMPETING

02:30:09.133 --> 02:30:11.001
STRATEGIES. NUMBER THREE

02:30:11.068 --> 02:30:12.236
EXPOSING DATA TO MARKETS THAT

02:30:12.303 --> 02:30:13.637
COULD POTENTIALLY PERMIT AN

02:30:13.704 --> 02:30:15.206
ESTIMATE OF REVENUE OR COST

02:30:15.272 --> 02:30:17.308
DATA. PRECISE TRIP ACTIVITY DATA

02:30:17.375 --> 02:30:19.009
CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION ON COSTS

02:30:19.076 --> 02:30:20.244
AND REVENUE THAT OPERATORS MAY

02:30:20.311 --> 02:30:22.947
NOT WISH TO REVEAL TO THE PUBLIC

02:30:23.013 --> 02:30:24.148
OR TO THEIR COMPETITORS. NEXT

02:30:24.215 --> 02:30:27.785
SLIDE. BUT THERE ARE WAYS TO

02:30:27.852 --> 02:30:29.120
ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS SOMEWHAT

02:30:29.186 --> 02:30:30.388
THROUGH DATA DESIGN AND THROUGH

02:30:30.454 --> 02:30:31.789
OTHER, OTHER DIFFERENT DESIGNS

02:30:31.856 --> 02:30:33.991
OF ACCESS. CONCERNS WITH PII

02:30:34.058 --> 02:30:35.659
COME WITH THE ABILITY TO MATCH

02:30:35.726 --> 02:30:37.261
OUTSIDE INFORMATION, SUCH AS

02:30:37.328 --> 02:30:38.996
HOME ADDRESS AND PERHAPS KNOWN

02:30:39.063 --> 02:30:40.965
TRAVEL TIMES, WITH INFORMATION

02:30:41.031 --> 02:30:42.566
IN THE DATA THAT COULD PLAUSIBLY

02:30:42.633 --> 02:30:44.335
IDENTIFY A PERSON WHO MADE A

02:30:44.402 --> 02:30:46.537
GIVEN TRIP. THIS ISSUE CAN BE

02:30:46.604 --> 02:30:47.905
ADDRESSED BY INSERTING SOME

02:30:47.972 --> 02:30:50.074
RANDOMNESS AND IMPRECISION THAT

02:30:50.141 --> 02:30:51.842
MOVES THE ORIGIN AND DESTINATION

02:30:51.909 --> 02:30:53.811
BY SOME DISTANCE IN A RANDOM WAY

02:30:53.878 --> 02:30:55.212
THAT ISN'T LARGE, BUT CAN ALTER

02:30:55.279 --> 02:30:57.415
THE ACTUAL ADDRESS BUT STILL

02:30:57.481 --> 02:30:58.749
PRESERVE THE GENERAL TRAVEL

02:30:58.816 --> 02:31:00.918
PATTERNS EXPRESSED IN THE DATA.

02:31:00.985 --> 02:31:02.386
THE SAME APPROACH CAN BE TAKEN

02:31:02.453 --> 02:31:04.989
WITH TRAVEL TIME. SUCH

02:31:05.055 --> 02:31:05.956
MODIFICATIONS, IF NOT

02:31:06.023 --> 02:31:07.024
EXCESSIVELY LARGE, WILL

02:31:07.091 --> 02:31:09.260
GENERALLY PRESERVE THE VALUE OF

02:31:09.326 --> 02:31:11.729
THAT DATA FOR PUBLIC POLICY

02:31:11.796 --> 02:31:15.966
RESEARCH. NEXT SLIDE. WITH

02:31:16.033 --> 02:31:17.134
REGARDS TO ADDRESSING DATA

02:31:17.201 --> 02:31:18.602
CONCERNS WITH EXPOSURE OF

02:31:18.669 --> 02:31:20.337
COMPETITIVE INFORMATION.

02:31:20.404 --> 02:31:21.839
DE-IDENTIFIED TRIP DATA, EVEN

02:31:21.906 --> 02:31:23.908
WITHOUT EXPOSING PII, WILL SHOW

02:31:23.974 --> 02:31:25.376
COMPETITORS WHERE THE OPERATOR

02:31:25.443 --> 02:31:26.944
IS EARNING REVENUE AND

02:31:27.011 --> 02:31:28.579
APPROXIMATELY HOW MUCH THIS

02:31:28.646 --> 02:31:30.414
ISSUE IS HARDER TO ADDRESS WITH

02:31:30.481 --> 02:31:32.416
DATA DESIGN WITHOUT COMPROMISING

02:31:32.483 --> 02:31:34.718
ITS VALUE FOR POLICY RESEARCH.

02:31:34.785 --> 02:31:36.554
RATHER THAN POSTING THE DATA ON

02:31:36.620 --> 02:31:38.088
THE INTERNET, AGENCIES COULD

02:31:38.155 --> 02:31:39.490
CONSIDER MORE CAREFULLY CURATING

02:31:39.557 --> 02:31:42.026
DATA ACCESS. AND FOR THOSE WHO

02:31:42.092 --> 02:31:44.195
HAVE A VERIFIABLE NEED FOR

02:31:44.261 --> 02:31:46.230
POLICY PURPOSES, FOR POLICY

02:31:46.297 --> 02:31:48.899
PURPOSES OF ANALYSIS, MARKERS

02:31:48.966 --> 02:31:51.035
CAN BE PLACED IN THE DATA SET,

02:31:51.101 --> 02:31:52.069
OR THE DATA SET COULD BE

02:31:52.136 --> 02:31:53.204
ANALYZED WITHIN A CLOUD BASED

02:31:53.270 --> 02:31:55.506
SYSTEM THAT LEAVES IT SECURE ON

02:31:55.573 --> 02:31:56.674
A CLOUD BASED SERVER. NEXT

02:31:56.740 --> 02:32:00.311
SLIDE. SO IN CONCLUSION, TNCS

02:32:00.377 --> 02:32:01.712
ARE A CENTRAL PLAYERS IN OUR

02:32:01.779 --> 02:32:03.147
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. THE

02:32:03.214 --> 02:32:04.648
RESEARCH COMMUNITY NEEDS ACCESS

02:32:04.715 --> 02:32:06.350
TO THIS DATA ABOUT TNC

02:32:06.417 --> 02:32:07.885
OPERATIONS TO CONTINUOUSLY

02:32:07.952 --> 02:32:09.720
MEASURE ITS IMPACTS, AS WELL AS

02:32:09.787 --> 02:32:11.155
ADDRESS QUESTIONS THAT DIRECTLY

02:32:11.222 --> 02:32:12.957
INFORM POLICY QUESTIONS AND

02:32:13.023 --> 02:32:14.358
RELATED METRICS. AND THERE ARE

02:32:14.425 --> 02:32:16.560
WAYS TO DESIGN DATA AND DATA

02:32:16.627 --> 02:32:17.528
ACCESS TO ALLOW RESEARCH. THE

02:32:17.595 --> 02:32:19.363
RESEARCH COMMUNITY TO ADDRESS

02:32:19.430 --> 02:32:20.498
THESE QUESTIONS, WHILE

02:32:20.564 --> 02:32:21.632
SIGNIFICANTLY MITIGATING THE

02:32:21.699 --> 02:32:24.168
RISK ASSOCIATED WITH PII, PII,

02:32:24.235 --> 02:32:26.570
AND EXPOSURE OF COMPETITIVE

02:32:26.637 --> 02:32:27.505
INFORMATION. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR

02:32:27.571 --> 02:32:30.007
THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE.

02:32:30.074 --> 02:32:31.375
THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS

02:32:31.442 --> 02:32:33.344
FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS BEFORE I

02:32:33.410 --> 02:32:36.347
START? OKAY. SO THANK YOU. AND

02:32:36.413 --> 02:32:38.516
FIRST I WANT TO TALK ABOUT LOCAL

02:32:38.582 --> 02:32:39.517
COORDINATION FOR SAN FRANCISCO.

02:32:39.583 --> 02:32:41.452
YOUR COUNTY HAS A SPECIAL

02:32:41.519 --> 02:32:44.088
STATUTE THAT AUTHORIZED ATTACKS

02:32:44.154 --> 02:32:46.690
ON TNC TRIPS ORIGINATING IN THE

02:32:46.757 --> 02:32:48.292
CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN

02:32:48.359 --> 02:32:50.027
FRANCISCO. CAN YOU SPEAK TO MORE

02:32:50.094 --> 02:32:51.862
MORE ABOUT THE TYPES OF PROJECTS

02:32:51.929 --> 02:32:55.900
THAT THOSE REVENUES FUND, AND

02:32:55.966 --> 02:32:57.201
ARE THEY SPECIFIC TO

02:32:57.268 --> 02:32:59.737
TRANSPORTATION? THERE ARE TWO

02:32:59.803 --> 02:33:01.605
MAJOR CATEGORIES OF FUNDING. ONE

02:33:01.672 --> 02:33:03.374
OF THEM IS FOR SAFETY PROJECTS.

02:33:03.440 --> 02:33:06.544
SO THINGS LIKE BIKE LANES,

02:33:06.610 --> 02:33:07.745
INTERSECTION IMPROVEMENTS TO

02:33:07.811 --> 02:33:08.746
IMPROVE PEDESTRIAN SAFETY,

02:33:08.812 --> 02:33:10.915
THINGS LIKE THAT. AND THE OTHER

02:33:10.981 --> 02:33:12.983
IS GOES TO THE SAN FRANCISCO

02:33:13.050 --> 02:33:15.953
MUNICIPAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCY

02:33:16.020 --> 02:33:21.258
FOR TRANSIT SERVICE PROJECTS.

02:33:21.325 --> 02:33:26.030
AND GIVEN THE STATE OF THE DATA

02:33:26.096 --> 02:33:27.865
TRANSPARENCY CONVERSATION, I

02:33:27.932 --> 02:33:29.199
KNOW SOME OF THE RESEARCH

02:33:29.266 --> 02:33:30.334
COMMUNITY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

02:33:30.401 --> 02:33:31.435
BELIEVE THAT WE'RE MISSING A

02:33:31.502 --> 02:33:33.203
BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF TNCS

02:33:33.270 --> 02:33:35.005
FROM THE STATE. CAN YOU SPEAK

02:33:35.072 --> 02:33:36.307
MORE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT WHERE

02:33:36.373 --> 02:33:39.376
YOU THINK THE GAPS ARE? AND

02:33:39.443 --> 02:33:40.444
ALSO, OTHER THAN WHAT WAS

02:33:40.511 --> 02:33:42.980
SUGGESTED IN THE PRESENTATION,

02:33:43.047 --> 02:33:45.082
WHAT INFORMATION COULD HELP

02:33:45.149 --> 02:33:46.550
POLICYMAKERS REACH OUT, REACH

02:33:46.617 --> 02:33:48.319
OUR PUBLIC POLICY OBJECTIVES? SO

02:33:48.385 --> 02:33:50.854
YOU TALKED ABOUT BASICALLY

02:33:50.921 --> 02:33:54.224
RANDOMIZATION AND ALSO LIMITING

02:33:54.291 --> 02:33:57.962
WHO HAS ACCESS. ARE THERE OTHER

02:33:58.028 --> 02:33:59.863
THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE

02:33:59.930 --> 02:34:00.431
CONSIDERING AS POLICYMAKERS.

02:34:00.497 --> 02:34:01.332
BECAUSE I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT

02:34:01.398 --> 02:34:03.133
THAT WE HAVE THIS DATA, AND WE

02:34:03.200 --> 02:34:05.736
HAVE PEOPLE LIKE YOU GUYS WHO

02:34:05.803 --> 02:34:06.370
USE IT TO HELP INFORM WHAT IT

02:34:06.437 --> 02:34:08.572
MEANS. SO IF WE LOOKED AT THE

02:34:08.639 --> 02:34:09.573
PREVIOUS PANELS AND WE THOUGHT

02:34:09.640 --> 02:34:10.674
ABOUT HOW AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES

02:34:10.741 --> 02:34:12.209
ARE ENTERING THE MARKET, WHAT IS

02:34:12.276 --> 02:34:14.244
THAT DOING TO IT? HOW IS THAT

02:34:14.311 --> 02:34:15.346
REALLY IMPACTING TRANSPORTATION

02:34:15.412 --> 02:34:17.247
AGENCIES? YOU KNOW, WE HAVE

02:34:17.314 --> 02:34:19.249
BUDGET DISCUSSIONS EVERY WEEK

02:34:19.316 --> 02:34:21.952
ABOUT WHAT ARE THE IMPACTS TO

02:34:22.019 --> 02:34:23.487
OUR TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES.

02:34:23.554 --> 02:34:25.823
AND, YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE THINK

02:34:25.889 --> 02:34:27.658
IT'S RELATED TO TNCS. OTHER

02:34:27.725 --> 02:34:28.659
PEOPLE THINK IT'S RELATED TO

02:34:28.726 --> 02:34:31.195
SOMETHING ELSE. SO DO YOU HAVE

02:34:31.261 --> 02:34:32.796
ANY AND THAT AND WE CAN DO

02:34:32.863 --> 02:34:34.264
COMBINE THAT WITH ANY FINAL

02:34:34.331 --> 02:34:35.899
REMARKS OF OTHER IDEAS. MAYBE

02:34:35.966 --> 02:34:37.234
YOU CAME UP SINCE BEFORE YOU DID

02:34:37.301 --> 02:34:40.604
THE PRESENTATION AND ANY PARTING

02:34:40.671 --> 02:34:41.639
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR US

02:34:41.705 --> 02:34:44.208
POLICYMAKERS? WELL, I THINK IT

02:34:44.274 --> 02:34:46.276
WOULD BE A GREAT FIRST STEP IF

02:34:46.343 --> 02:34:49.947
WE IF THE DATA THAT IS

02:34:50.014 --> 02:34:51.982
STRUCTURED NOW WAS SIMPLY

02:34:52.049 --> 02:34:53.884
ACCESSIBLE IN THE FORMAT THAT,

02:34:53.951 --> 02:34:55.619
YOU KNOW, WE DISCUSSED HERE AND

02:34:55.686 --> 02:34:58.188
WE'VE PROPOSED HERE SOME, SOME

02:34:58.255 --> 02:34:59.189
PLAUSIBLE APPROACHES TO ADDRESS

02:34:59.256 --> 02:35:01.125
MANY OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE

02:35:01.191 --> 02:35:03.160
BEEN LIMITING OUR ACCESS TO THAT

02:35:03.227 --> 02:35:05.329
DATA. SO I WOULD START WITH

02:35:05.396 --> 02:35:06.830
THOSE SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS.

02:35:06.897 --> 02:35:08.932
AND, YOU KNOW, GENERAL APPROACH

02:35:08.999 --> 02:35:12.603
OF EFFECTIVELY, ONE MAJOR POINT

02:35:12.670 --> 02:35:14.672
I'D LIKE TO MAKE HERE IS THAT

02:35:14.738 --> 02:35:16.907
THE DATA DOES NOT HAVE TO BE

02:35:16.974 --> 02:35:18.342
INCREDIBLY PRECISE FOR IT STILL

02:35:18.409 --> 02:35:21.512
TO HAVE VALUE WITH RESPECT TO

02:35:21.578 --> 02:35:22.713
TRAVEL DEMAND BEHAVIOR, WE NEED

02:35:22.780 --> 02:35:24.748
TO KNOW THE GENERAL NEIGHBORHOOD

02:35:24.815 --> 02:35:25.616
WHERE TRIPS OCCUR. WE NEED TO

02:35:25.683 --> 02:35:27.418
KNOW THE GENERAL AREA. WE NEED

02:35:27.484 --> 02:35:29.086
TO KNOW THE GENERAL ORIGIN

02:35:29.153 --> 02:35:31.855
DESTINATION SO THAT WE CAN MODEL

02:35:31.922 --> 02:35:32.990
QUESTIONS SUCH AS, YOU KNOW

02:35:33.057 --> 02:35:35.526
WHAT? WHAT'S THE COMPLEMENT?

02:35:35.592 --> 02:35:36.894
COMPETE WITH RESPECT TO FIXED

02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:38.429
ROUTE TRANSIT, WHICH WAS ASKED

02:35:38.495 --> 02:35:40.364
PREVIOUSLY, BUT I WOULD START

02:35:40.431 --> 02:35:43.467
WITH THOSE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS

02:35:43.534 --> 02:35:47.404
TO BUILD ON FIRST. MAY I? YEAH,

02:35:47.471 --> 02:35:49.907
PLEASE. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE,

02:35:49.973 --> 02:35:51.508
THE MOST VALUABLE PIECE OF DATA

02:35:51.575 --> 02:35:55.012
THAT THE CPUC HAS AND WOULD BE

02:35:55.079 --> 02:35:56.280
SUFFICIENT FOR THE VAST MAJORITY

02:35:56.346 --> 02:35:58.615
OF OUR PLANNING NEEDS, IS

02:35:58.682 --> 02:36:00.751
DETAILED TRIP LEVEL DATA. AND

02:36:00.818 --> 02:36:02.886
THE COMMISSION HAS DEALT WITH

02:36:02.953 --> 02:36:05.055
THE ISSUES OF PERSONALLY

02:36:05.122 --> 02:36:06.924
IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION,

02:36:06.990 --> 02:36:10.160
SPECIFICALLY AROUND GEOGRAPHY,

02:36:10.227 --> 02:36:13.363
BY OBSCURING PRECISE LATITUDE

02:36:13.430 --> 02:36:14.898
AND LONGITUDE FROM PUBLIC

02:36:14.965 --> 02:36:15.733
DISCLOSURE. SO THOSE ARE AMONG

02:36:15.799 --> 02:36:17.401
THE NARROW EXCEPTIONS. WHAT

02:36:17.468 --> 02:36:18.402
CANNOT BE PUBLISHED WITH THE

02:36:18.469 --> 02:36:19.770
RULES AS THEY HAVE BEEN

02:36:19.837 --> 02:36:21.438
ESTABLISHED, AND INSTEAD THEY

02:36:21.505 --> 02:36:23.874
ARE REPORTED AT CENSUS

02:36:23.941 --> 02:36:25.342
GEOGRAPHIES LIKE CENSUS BLOCKS

02:36:25.409 --> 02:36:27.778
AND BLOCK GROUPS. AND THAT IS

02:36:27.845 --> 02:36:29.613
MORE THAN SUFFICIENT FOR

02:36:29.680 --> 02:36:30.948
PLANNING NEEDS. SO UNDER THE

02:36:31.014 --> 02:36:33.183
RULES, AS THEY HAVE BEEN

02:36:33.250 --> 02:36:34.451
ESTABLISHED AND WITH AN EYE TO

02:36:34.518 --> 02:36:35.719
PROTECTING PERSONALLY

02:36:35.786 --> 02:36:37.254
IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION, IT'S

02:36:37.321 --> 02:36:39.857
OUR POSITION THAT THAT DATA CAN

02:36:39.923 --> 02:36:42.593
AND SHOULD BE RELEASED AS IT IS.

02:36:42.659 --> 02:36:45.796
THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK OUR

02:36:45.863 --> 02:36:46.930
THIRD PANEL FOR YOUR

02:36:46.997 --> 02:36:48.298
CONTRIBUTIONS. VERY THOUGHTFUL.

02:36:48.365 --> 02:36:50.134
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN FROM MY

02:36:50.200 --> 02:36:52.269
POLITICAL SCIENCE TRAINING ABOUT

02:36:52.336 --> 02:36:54.071
RANDOMIZATION, AND IT WAS A GOOD

02:36:54.138 --> 02:36:55.939
THING I LOOKED AT THAT. I WAS

02:36:56.006 --> 02:36:57.241
LIKE, OH MAN, THAT WAS A LONG

02:36:57.307 --> 02:36:59.343
TIME AGO. BUT I REMEMBER THAT

02:36:59.409 --> 02:37:00.344
TECHNIQUE. SO I WANT TO THANK

02:37:00.410 --> 02:37:03.113
YOU. AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE

02:37:03.180 --> 02:37:04.148
ON TO THE PUBLIC PORTION OR THE

02:37:04.214 --> 02:37:05.582
PORTION OF PUBLIC COMMENT,

02:37:05.649 --> 02:37:06.383
ANYBODY IN THE ROOM. WE HAVE A

02:37:06.450 --> 02:37:09.186
COUPLE PEOPLE STILL IN THE ROOM.

02:37:09.253 --> 02:37:09.853
YOU MAY APPROACH THE MICROPHONE

02:37:09.920 --> 02:37:11.355
WITH THE NAME, AFFILIATION AND

02:37:11.421 --> 02:37:13.624
ANY CONCERNS. PLEASE LIMIT YOUR

02:37:13.690 --> 02:37:15.559
COMMENT TIME TO ONE MINUTE.

02:37:15.626 --> 02:37:22.266
THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR.

02:37:22.332 --> 02:37:23.267
COMMITTEE MEMBERS LOUIS COSTA

02:37:23.333 --> 02:37:24.835
WITH SMART TRANSPORTATION

02:37:24.902 --> 02:37:26.804
DIVISION. I JUST WANT TO RAISE A

02:37:26.870 --> 02:37:28.305
CONCERN THAT CREW TRANSPORTATION

02:37:28.372 --> 02:37:30.507
OPERATORS, WHICH WERE CREATED TO

02:37:30.574 --> 02:37:33.010
WHO UNDER SB 757, WHICH WAS

02:37:33.076 --> 02:37:34.378
APPROVED BY THIS COMMITTEE AND

02:37:34.444 --> 02:37:36.346
APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND

02:37:36.413 --> 02:37:38.115
SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR, CREATED

02:37:38.182 --> 02:37:39.917
A SPECIFIC CARRIER FOR RAILROAD,

02:37:39.983 --> 02:37:41.318
A SPECIFIC TYPE OF CARRIER, TO

02:37:41.385 --> 02:37:42.686
CARRIER RAILROAD CREWS AROUND

02:37:42.753 --> 02:37:44.087
EVERY ALMOST EVERY RAILROAD CREW

02:37:44.154 --> 02:37:45.622
MEMBER DURING THE COURSE OF HIS

02:37:45.689 --> 02:37:47.057
DAY OF EMPLOYMENT GETS INTO A

02:37:47.124 --> 02:37:49.126
THIRD PARTY CARRIER, THIRD PARTY

02:37:49.193 --> 02:37:50.694
CONTRACTED CARRIER. THEY'RE NOT

02:37:50.761 --> 02:37:52.496
COVERED BY WORKMAN'S COMP. IF

02:37:52.563 --> 02:37:54.164
THEY'RE INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT

02:37:54.231 --> 02:37:56.333
CAUSED BY A THIRD PARTY,

02:37:56.400 --> 02:37:57.501
OFTENTIMES THEY'RE SOLELY CAN

02:37:57.568 --> 02:37:58.969
ONLY RECUPERATE LOST WAGES, PAIN

02:37:59.036 --> 02:38:00.304
AND SUFFERING MEDICAL COSTS

02:38:00.370 --> 02:38:02.573
BECAUSE OF THAT THIRD PARTY'S

02:38:02.639 --> 02:38:03.941
INSURANCE, THERE IS NO

02:38:04.007 --> 02:38:05.776
REQUIREMENT FOR CARRIER THE

02:38:05.843 --> 02:38:07.110
RAILROADS TO COVER THEM. UNDER

02:38:07.177 --> 02:38:08.312
THE FEDERAL EMPLOYEES LIABILITY

02:38:08.378 --> 02:38:11.615
ACT, SB 757 REQUIRED $5 MILLION

02:38:11.682 --> 02:38:13.083
OF GENERAL LIABILITY COVERAGE

02:38:13.150 --> 02:38:14.651
AND 1 MILLION OF UNINSURED

02:38:14.718 --> 02:38:16.053
UNDERINSURED MOTORIST COVERAGE.

02:38:16.119 --> 02:38:18.689
WE'RE CONCERNED THAT LESSENING

02:38:18.755 --> 02:38:20.624
THE AMOUNT OF INSURANCE FOR TNCS

02:38:20.691 --> 02:38:22.659
MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON

02:38:22.726 --> 02:38:24.328
RAILROAD EMPLOYEES. BECAUSE THE

02:38:24.394 --> 02:38:26.930
RAILROADS HAVE EMBRACED USING

02:38:26.997 --> 02:38:28.732
TNCS TO TRANSPORT CREWS NOW, SO

02:38:28.799 --> 02:38:30.601
I JUST WANTED TO RAISE THAT

02:38:30.667 --> 02:38:32.069
CONCERN IN THE EVENT THAT THERE

02:38:32.135 --> 02:38:33.904
IS LEGISLATION PENDING THAT IS

02:38:33.971 --> 02:38:35.372
GOING TO BE HEARD BY THIS

02:38:35.439 --> 02:38:36.240
COMMITTEE, WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S

02:38:36.306 --> 02:38:38.642
GOING TO HAVE THE REQUEST TO

02:38:38.709 --> 02:38:39.176
LOWER THAT THAT INSURANCE

02:38:39.243 --> 02:38:41.745
MINIMUM MAXIMUM FOR UNINSURED OR

02:38:41.812 --> 02:38:43.647
UNDERINSURED MOTORISTS JUST

02:38:43.714 --> 02:38:45.616
WANTED TO RAISE THAT CONCERN. SO

02:38:45.682 --> 02:38:53.590
THANK YOU SO MUCH. MADAM CHAIR.

02:38:53.657 --> 02:38:55.425
MEMBERS OF THE CONSUMER

02:38:55.492 --> 02:38:57.694
ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA HERE TO

02:38:57.761 --> 02:38:59.663
TESTIFY SPECIFICALLY ON THE UIM

02:38:59.730 --> 02:39:01.899
INSURANCE PIECE. THERE WAS A LOT

02:39:01.965 --> 02:39:03.133
OF CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS WITH

02:39:03.200 --> 02:39:04.534
THE TNC REPRESENTATIVES, AND I

02:39:04.601 --> 02:39:05.903
KNOW WE'LL HAVE MORE

02:39:05.969 --> 02:39:07.604
CONVERSATION WITH SB 371 COMES

02:39:07.671 --> 02:39:09.039
TO THIS COMMITTEE, BUT I WANTED

02:39:09.106 --> 02:39:10.941
TO RAISE JUST A FEW SHORT

02:39:11.008 --> 02:39:13.143
POINTS. WE ARE IN ACTIVE

02:39:13.210 --> 02:39:14.077
CONVERSATIONS WITH SENATOR

02:39:14.144 --> 02:39:15.612
CABALDON, LYFT AND UBER. WE WERE

02:39:15.679 --> 02:39:17.080
ACTUALLY TALKING TO UBER AT 230

02:39:17.147 --> 02:39:18.315
TODAY, HENCE MY EXIT FROM THE

02:39:18.382 --> 02:39:20.183
ROOM. TRYING TO REALLY NAIL DOWN

02:39:20.250 --> 02:39:22.753
THIS ISSUE OF THE LACK OF DATA.

02:39:22.819 --> 02:39:24.588
AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT BACK IN

02:39:24.655 --> 02:39:26.056
2014, THE LIMITS WERE BASED ON

02:39:26.123 --> 02:39:27.391
NOTHING BECAUSE UBER DIDN'T

02:39:27.457 --> 02:39:28.759
EXIST. BUT NOW WE HAVE TEN YEARS

02:39:28.825 --> 02:39:31.161
OF DATA AND WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO

02:39:31.228 --> 02:39:32.329
SEE, YOU KNOW, WHERE THE CLAIMS

02:39:32.396 --> 02:39:33.497
FALL, WHAT LIMITS SHOULD BE. AND

02:39:33.563 --> 02:39:34.932
THAT'S WHERE THIS HEARING DID

02:39:34.998 --> 02:39:36.466
HIGHLIGHT THE LACK OF

02:39:36.533 --> 02:39:37.434
TRANSPARENCY THROUGH THE CPUC

02:39:37.501 --> 02:39:38.735
AND THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE HAVING

02:39:38.802 --> 02:39:39.970
WITH THE REPORTS NOT BEING

02:39:40.037 --> 02:39:41.505
PUBLISHED AND THE REDACTIONS. SO

02:39:41.571 --> 02:39:42.439
WE'RE WORKING THROUGH THOSE

02:39:42.506 --> 02:39:45.509
ISSUES NOW TO TRY TO HAVE AN

02:39:45.575 --> 02:39:46.276
INFORMED DECISION ON WHAT THE

02:39:46.343 --> 02:39:48.345
LIMITS SHOULD BE THIS YEAR.

02:39:48.412 --> 02:39:51.214
SECOND, THERE WERE COMMENTS MADE

02:39:51.281 --> 02:39:53.483
ABOUT PAY TO DRIVERS AND A

02:39:53.550 --> 02:39:55.118
BENEFIT THAT COULD BE GIVEN TO

02:39:55.185 --> 02:39:56.019
DRIVERS BASED ON INSURANCE

02:39:56.086 --> 02:39:58.021
DECREASING. CÃC HAS NOT SEEN A

02:39:58.088 --> 02:40:00.524
PROPOSAL TO DATE THAT WOULD TIE

02:40:00.590 --> 02:40:02.626
INSURANCE DECREASES TO DRIVERS

02:40:02.693 --> 02:40:03.794
REVENUE. WE FULLY SUPPORT

02:40:03.860 --> 02:40:05.295
IMPROVED WORKING CONDITIONS FOR

02:40:05.362 --> 02:40:06.964
DRIVERS, TRANSPARENCY FOR DRIVER

02:40:07.030 --> 02:40:08.565
PAY, INCREASED DRIVER PAY. BUT

02:40:08.632 --> 02:40:10.667
THERE HAS NOT BEEN HASN'T BEEN A

02:40:10.734 --> 02:40:12.069
PROPOSAL CORRELATING THE TWO

02:40:12.135 --> 02:40:14.538
SECOND POINT ON AUTONOMOUS

02:40:14.604 --> 02:40:16.406
VEHICLES, UBER CEO SAID IN

02:40:16.473 --> 02:40:17.708
JANUARY OF THIS YEAR HE EXPECTS

02:40:17.774 --> 02:40:19.242
TO GO FULLY AUTONOMOUS IN TEN

02:40:19.309 --> 02:40:20.410
YEARS. THEY'VE WOUND THAT BACK.

02:40:20.477 --> 02:40:22.279
HE'S MADE A LOT OF DIFFERENT

02:40:22.346 --> 02:40:23.447
STATEMENTS ON THIS. BUT AGAIN,

02:40:23.513 --> 02:40:25.015
IF INSURANCE GOES DOWN TODAY AND

02:40:25.082 --> 02:40:26.883
DRIVERS GO AWAY IN A DECADE,

02:40:26.950 --> 02:40:29.052
THAT SHOULD BE BROUGHT INTO THE

02:40:29.119 --> 02:40:30.487
CONVERSATION. AND THEN LASTLY,

02:40:30.554 --> 02:40:32.889
THERE WAS CONVERSATION COMPARING

02:40:32.956 --> 02:40:34.424
UBER'S UIM REQUIREMENT, WHICH WE

02:40:34.491 --> 02:40:36.626
ADMIT IS UNIQUE TO UBER, TO

02:40:36.693 --> 02:40:38.829
TAXIS, LIMOUSINES, BUSSES. UBER

02:40:38.895 --> 02:40:41.331
IS A VERY PROFITABLE COMPANY.

02:40:41.398 --> 02:40:43.867
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT IF I'M IN AN

02:40:43.934 --> 02:40:45.202
UBER, I HAVE ADDITIONAL

02:40:45.268 --> 02:40:46.336
PROTECTIONS. AND UBER'S PROFITS

02:40:46.403 --> 02:40:49.940
WERE REPORTED FOR LAST YEAR AS

02:40:50.007 --> 02:40:50.974
2.8 BILLION IN OPERATING

02:40:51.041 --> 02:40:52.309
PROFITS. SO AGAIN, YOU KNOW,

02:40:52.376 --> 02:40:54.644
THERE'S A LOT OF FACTORS TO PLAY

02:40:54.711 --> 02:40:56.046
HERE. WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO

02:40:56.113 --> 02:40:57.247
YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE

02:40:57.314 --> 02:40:58.982
AND TALKING TO THE COMMITTEE

02:40:59.049 --> 02:41:00.083
ABOUT 371 WHEN IT'S AMENDED UP,

02:41:00.150 --> 02:41:01.952
BUT JUST WANTED TO FLAG THOSE

02:41:02.019 --> 02:41:06.189
TODAY. THANK YOU. AND I WANT TO

02:41:06.256 --> 02:41:08.191
THANK AGAIN ALL THE MEMBERS OF

02:41:08.258 --> 02:41:09.292
THE COMMITTEE WHO PARTICIPATED

02:41:09.359 --> 02:41:11.828
TODAY. WE HAD A ROBUST HEARING

02:41:11.895 --> 02:41:13.196
AND THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC

02:41:13.263 --> 02:41:15.032
WHO TUNED IN AND MADE PUBLIC

02:41:15.098 --> 02:41:16.666
COMMENT. THANK YOU TO OUR

02:41:16.733 --> 02:41:17.501
WITNESSES FOR SHARING THEIR

02:41:17.567 --> 02:41:19.136
KNOWLEDGE WITH THIS COMMITTEE. I

02:41:19.202 --> 02:41:20.837
FOUND THIS CONVERSATION VERY

02:41:20.904 --> 02:41:21.938
ILLUMINATING. I DIDN'T MAKE AS

02:41:22.005 --> 02:41:23.440
MANY JOKES AS I NORMALLY DID,

02:41:23.507 --> 02:41:25.442
BUT I DIDN'T HAVE AS MANY

02:41:25.509 --> 02:41:27.377
OPPORTUNITIES. SO NEXT TIME YOU

02:41:27.444 --> 02:41:28.045
CAN OPEN UP MORE OPPORTUNITIES.

02:41:28.111 --> 02:41:29.880
WE DIDN'T HEAR A PUN FROM

02:41:29.946 --> 02:41:30.480
ASSEMBLYMEMBER ROGERS, SO I'M

02:41:30.547 --> 02:41:33.784
QUITE DISAPPOINTED WITH THAT.

02:41:33.850 --> 02:41:50.267
THIS MEETING IS ADJOURNED.
