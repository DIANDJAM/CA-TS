00:54:55.892 --> 00:54:57.627
I'D LIKE TO SHARE A STORY

00:54:57.694 --> 00:55:00.230
RECOLLECTED BY ARUN GANDHI, THE

00:55:00.296 --> 00:55:03.166
GRANDSON OF MAHATMA GANDHI. IN

00:55:03.233 --> 00:55:05.402
1950, WHEN HE WAS 16, HE WAS

00:55:05.468 --> 00:55:07.771
LIVING WITH HIS PARENTS AT AN

00:55:07.837 --> 00:55:08.838
INSTITUTE THAT HIS GRANDFATHER

00:55:08.905 --> 00:55:12.075
HAD FOUNDED. IT WAS 18 MILES

00:55:12.142 --> 00:55:13.843
OUTSIDE OF DURBAN, SOUTH AFRICA,

00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:16.880
IN THE MIDDLE OF CANE FIELDS.

00:55:16.946 --> 00:55:18.314
ONE DAY, HIS FATHER ASKED HIM TO

00:55:18.381 --> 00:55:20.850
DRIVE HIM INTO TOWN FOR A DAY

00:55:20.917 --> 00:55:22.252
LONG MEETING AND TO ALSO HAVE

00:55:22.318 --> 00:55:24.621
THE CAR SERVICED. HIS FATHER

00:55:24.688 --> 00:55:27.724
ASKED HIM TO MEET HIM AT 5:00.

00:55:27.791 --> 00:55:29.659
ARUN DROPPED OFF THE CAR AND

00:55:29.726 --> 00:55:32.228
WENT TO A MOVIE. HE SAID IT WAS

00:55:32.295 --> 00:55:34.164
A JOHN WAYNE DOUBLE FEATURE AND

00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:37.000
HE LOST TRACK OF TIME. HE RAN TO

00:55:37.067 --> 00:55:39.803
THE GARAGE, GOT THE CAR. BUT AT

00:55:39.869 --> 00:55:42.038
6 P.M, HE FINALLY REACHED HIS

00:55:42.105 --> 00:55:44.574
DAD. HE LIED TO HIS FATHER ABOUT

00:55:44.641 --> 00:55:46.009
THE REASON FOR BEING LATE,

00:55:46.076 --> 00:55:48.144
SAYING THE CAR WAS NOT READY.

00:55:48.211 --> 00:55:50.580
HIS FATHER KNEW HIS WORDS WERE

00:55:50.647 --> 00:55:54.584
UNTRUE. NO SCOLDING CAME.

00:55:54.651 --> 00:55:56.219
INSTEAD, ARUN RECALLED THAT HIS

00:55:56.286 --> 00:55:58.922
FATHER LOOKED SO SAD AND HE

00:55:58.988 --> 00:56:01.291
SOFTLY SPOKE TO HIMSELF, SAYING,

00:56:01.357 --> 00:56:03.827
WHAT KIND OF FATHER AM I THAT MY

00:56:03.893 --> 00:56:06.062
SON IS AFRAID TO TELL ME THE

00:56:06.129 --> 00:56:08.765
TRUTH? I MUST PONDER THIS.

00:56:08.832 --> 00:56:10.734
RATHER THAN GETTING IN THE CAR.

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:13.770
HIS FATHER BEGAN TO WALK HOME,

00:56:13.837 --> 00:56:15.038
CONTEMPLATING HIS FAILURE AND

00:56:15.105 --> 00:56:18.641
HOW HE MUST IMPROVE. ARUN SAID

00:56:18.708 --> 00:56:20.577
IN HIS SUIT AND DRESS SHOES. HE

00:56:20.643 --> 00:56:23.480
BEGAN TO WALK HOME IN THE DARK

00:56:23.546 --> 00:56:26.983
ON ALMOST UNPAVED, UNLIT ROADS.

00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:30.386
I COULDN'T LEAVE HIM. SO FOR 5.5

00:56:30.453 --> 00:56:32.655
HOURS I DROVE BEHIND HIM,

00:56:32.722 --> 00:56:34.591
WATCHING MY FATHER GO THROUGH

00:56:34.657 --> 00:56:36.392
AGONY OVER HIS FAILURE AS A

00:56:36.459 --> 00:56:39.195
FATHER. I DECIDED THEN AND THERE

00:56:39.262 --> 00:56:42.465
I WAS NEVER GOING TO LIE AGAIN.

00:56:42.532 --> 00:56:45.635
ARUN ENDED. ADDED, MY FATHER'S

00:56:45.702 --> 00:56:48.304
ACTION WAS SO POWERFUL THAT IT

00:56:48.371 --> 00:56:50.173
STILL FEELS LIKE IT HAPPENED

00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:52.175
YESTERDAY. THAT ONE EVENT

00:56:52.242 --> 00:56:55.111
CHANGED ARUN S LIFE TO HIS CORE

00:56:55.178 --> 00:56:58.281
AND HE SAID, I NOW MAKE THE

00:56:58.348 --> 00:56:59.749
DECISION EVERY MORNING TO BE

00:56:59.816 --> 00:57:02.185
BETTER AND OFTEN WONDER IF HE

00:57:02.252 --> 00:57:04.754
HAD PUNISHED ME, WHETHER I WOULD

00:57:04.821 --> 00:57:06.523
HAVE LEARNED A LESSON. I DON'T

00:57:06.589 --> 00:57:09.058
THINK SO. OUR FATHERS AND

00:57:09.125 --> 00:57:10.994
MOTHERS ARE OUR FIRST AND

00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:13.396
GREATEST TEACHERS, AND IF WE ARE

00:57:13.463 --> 00:57:15.331
FORTUNATE TO HAVE SUCH LOVING

00:57:15.398 --> 00:57:18.835
PARENTS IN OUR HEARTS, LET US

00:57:18.902 --> 00:57:19.836

TO SAY THAT A DIFFERENT WAY

01:11:45.567 --> 01:11:47.102
WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA COULD NOT

WASHINGTON BOULEVARD TODAY NAMED

01:12:23.772 --> 01:12:29.311
AFTER HIM. IN 2003, I MET MR.

01:12:29.378 --> 01:12:32.781
HOLDEN FIVE OR SO YEARS AGO. I

01:12:32.848 --> 01:12:34.917
WAS HIS ASSEMBLY MEMBER. I WAS

01:12:34.983 --> 01:12:37.019
RUNNING FOR OFFICE AND THE FIRST

01:12:37.086 --> 01:12:38.420
ENDORSER I HAD IN THE STATE

01:12:38.487 --> 01:12:40.289
LEGISLATURE WAS A FORMER

01:12:40.355 --> 01:12:42.624
MAJORITY LEADER, CHRIS HOLDEN,

01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:43.592
AND THE FIRST THING HE TOLD ME

01:12:43.659 --> 01:12:45.294
ABOUT RUNNING FOR OFFICE IS, YOU

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:47.896
SHOULD CALL MY DAD. AND I KIND

01:12:47.963 --> 01:12:50.933
OF BLEW IT OFF AND STARTED

01:12:50.999 --> 01:12:52.634
CALLING OTHER PEOPLE. AND I SAW

01:12:52.701 --> 01:12:54.703
CHRIS AGAIN AND HE SAID, YOU

01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:57.206
SHOULD CALL MY DAD. AND SO ONE

01:12:57.272 --> 01:12:59.608
DAY I CALLED HIS DAD, THINKING,

01:12:59.675 --> 01:13:01.810
THERE'S NO WAY NATE HOLDEN IS

01:13:01.877 --> 01:13:03.312
JUST SITTING BY THE PHONE

01:13:03.378 --> 01:13:04.747
WAITING FOR MY PHONE CALL. AND

01:13:04.813 --> 01:13:07.049
SURE ENOUGH, HE WAS. AND HE

01:13:07.116 --> 01:13:08.450
ANSWERED AND HE KNEW EXACTLY WHO

01:13:08.517 --> 01:13:12.321
I WAS. DESPITE OUR 63 YEAR AGE

01:13:12.387 --> 01:13:15.224
DIFFERENCE. AND HE GAVE ME SOME

01:13:15.290 --> 01:13:16.658
ADVICE THAT DAY ABOUT WORKING

01:13:16.725 --> 01:13:18.861
HARD AND CHAMPIONING THE PEOPLE.

01:13:18.927 --> 01:13:21.830
AND IT WAS THEN THAT I NOTICED

01:13:21.897 --> 01:13:23.599
AFTERWARDS I SAW NATE HOLDEN

01:13:23.665 --> 01:13:25.801
EVERYWHERE IN HIS 90S, BUT HE

01:13:25.868 --> 01:13:28.570
WAS AT THE OPENING OF THE K LINE

01:13:28.637 --> 01:13:31.039
IN LEIMERT PARK ON CRENSHAW.

01:13:31.106 --> 01:13:33.876
HERE COMES NATE HOLDEN. I SAW

01:13:33.942 --> 01:13:36.078
HIM AT THE PERFORMING ARTS

01:13:36.145 --> 01:13:37.346
THEATER NAMED AFTER HIM, WHEN

01:13:37.412 --> 01:13:39.348
THE VICE PRESIDENT CAME TO TOWN

01:13:39.414 --> 01:13:41.450
TO SPEAK WITH THEN CANDIDATE

01:13:41.517 --> 01:13:42.551
KAREN BASS, RUNNING FOR LOS

01:13:42.618 --> 01:13:45.721
ANGELES MAYOR. RUMOR HAS IT NATE

01:13:45.788 --> 01:13:49.091
HOLDEN WAS DRIVING LAST YEAR AT

01:13:49.158 --> 01:13:53.395
94. MY FAVORITE MEMORY OF MR.

01:13:53.462 --> 01:13:56.999
HOLDEN IS ONE THAT I FOUND WAS

01:13:57.065 --> 01:13:59.067
SHARED AMONGST MANY OF US, AND

01:13:59.134 --> 01:14:00.602
THAT IS THAT IF YOU WERE DOING

01:14:00.669 --> 01:14:02.738
SOMETHING WRONG, HE WAS GOING TO

01:14:02.805 --> 01:14:06.542
TELL YOU. AND I HAD A MOMENT ONE

01:14:06.608 --> 01:14:08.110
TIME WHERE HE DISAGREED WITH THE

01:14:08.177 --> 01:14:09.278
DECISION THAT I WAS GOING TO

01:14:09.344 --> 01:14:12.181
MAKE OR THAT I HAD MADE, AND HE

01:14:12.247 --> 01:14:15.417
TOLD ME ABOUT IT, AND I KIND OF

01:14:15.484 --> 01:14:18.353
STOOD UP TO HIM. AND I REALIZED

01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:19.855
IN THAT MOMENT, WE BECAME AS

01:14:19.922 --> 01:14:22.157
CLOSE AS WE WERE EVER GOING TO

01:14:22.224 --> 01:14:23.625
BE. AND I THINK THAT'S WHEN HE

01:14:23.692 --> 01:14:27.296
LIKED ME. BECAUSE I DIDN'T JUST

01:14:27.362 --> 01:14:29.431
BACK DOWN AND HE KNEW I WAS

01:14:29.498 --> 01:14:30.232
COMING FROM A RIGHTEOUS PLACE. I

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:31.266
REMEMBER CALLING CHRIS

01:14:31.333 --> 01:14:32.334
AFTERWARDS SAYING, MAN, I JUST

01:14:32.401 --> 01:14:34.937
GOT IT FROM YOUR DAD. AND HE

01:14:35.003 --> 01:14:38.373
SAID, WELCOME TO THE CLUB. MR.

01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:40.242
HOLDEN WAS A CHAMPION IN OUR

01:14:40.309 --> 01:14:42.945
COMMUNITY. HE SERVED THE

01:14:43.011 --> 01:14:45.280
NEIGHBORHOOD. THERE ARE MANY

01:14:45.347 --> 01:14:46.915
LEGACY MONUMENTS AND BUILDINGS

01:14:46.982 --> 01:14:48.750
AND STRUCTURES AND CHURCHES THAT

01:14:48.817 --> 01:14:52.087
WOULD NOT EXIST WITHOUT HIM. HE

01:14:52.154 --> 01:14:54.923
WAS AN EXAMPLE OF HOPE AND

01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:56.124
PROMISE. HE KEPT OUR STREETS

01:14:56.191 --> 01:14:58.093

01:15:07.636 --> 01:15:08.704
PROUD TO BE ONE OF THE LAST

01:15:08.770 --> 01:15:10.572

TOUCH ON HIS TIME HERE, AND I'M

01:15:12.307 --> 01:15:13.442
GRATEFUL THAT I WAS ABLE TO BE

01:15:13.508 --> 01:15:15.944

KENNETH HAHN, AND THAT'S WHERE

01:18:46.455 --> 01:18:49.324
HE LEARNED HOW TO DO RETAIL

01:18:49.391 --> 01:18:52.861
POLITICS. EVERY ELECTION, THEY

01:18:52.928 --> 01:18:55.464
SENT POTHOLDERS TO EVERY

01:18:55.530 --> 01:18:56.865
MOTHER'S HOME. YOU KNOW,

01:18:56.932 --> 01:18:58.366
POTHOLDERS ARE POTHOLDERS WHEN

01:18:58.433 --> 01:19:00.535
YOU TOOK THINGS OUT OF THE OVEN

01:19:00.602 --> 01:19:01.736
SO YOU WOULDN'T GET BURNED. BUT

01:19:01.803 --> 01:19:03.371
THOSE OF YOU IN THE ROOM WHO

01:19:03.438 --> 01:19:04.506
DON'T KNOW WHAT A POTHOLDER

01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:06.475
MEANT, AND THOSE HOW YOU WERE

01:19:06.541 --> 01:19:08.443
ABLE TO GET ELECTIONS WON

01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:10.245
BECAUSE THEIR NAMES WERE

01:19:10.312 --> 01:19:12.114
ENGRAVED ON THOSE POTHOLDERS.

01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:13.949
AND THOSE WERE TIMES WHERE, WHEN

01:19:14.015 --> 01:19:15.984
YOU NEEDED A POT, WHEN YOU

01:19:16.051 --> 01:19:19.054
NEEDED POTHOLES FILLED IN THE

01:19:19.121 --> 01:19:21.323
GROUND. THOSE WERE EVERY TIME

01:19:21.389 --> 01:19:24.559
THAT NATE HOLDEN NEEDED TO.

01:19:24.626 --> 01:19:26.661
PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO CALL NATE

01:19:26.728 --> 01:19:28.697
HOLDEN AND MAKE SURE THAT NOT

01:19:28.763 --> 01:19:30.232
ONLY TRIMS WAS TRIMMED, TRIMS

01:19:30.298 --> 01:19:33.235
WERE TREES WERE TRIMMED,

01:19:33.301 --> 01:19:35.070
POTHOLES IN THEIR THEIR ROADS

01:19:35.137 --> 01:19:37.873
WERE FIXED. YOU CAN CALL HIM.

01:19:37.939 --> 01:19:39.774
AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS WERE

01:19:39.841 --> 01:19:41.676
DONE WHEN I RAN MY FIRST LOS

01:19:41.743 --> 01:19:43.311
ANGELES MARATHON BECAUSE I RAN

01:19:43.378 --> 01:19:47.749
ABOUT EIGHT, I LOOKED IN THE LOS

01:19:47.816 --> 01:19:49.251
ANGELES CITY ON. I FORGOT WHAT

01:19:49.317 --> 01:19:51.887
STREET IT WAS. I RAN SO MANY, I

01:19:51.953 --> 01:19:54.089
LOOKED AND YOUR FATHER WAS

01:19:54.156 --> 01:19:56.992
RUNNING THOSE MARATHONS, AND HE

01:19:57.058 --> 01:19:59.427
WAS, WELL, IN HER 70S AND 80S

01:19:59.494 --> 01:20:01.396
RUNNING MARATHONS, AND I COULD

01:20:01.463 --> 01:20:03.465
NOT BELIEVE NATE HOLDEN WAS

01:20:03.532 --> 01:20:04.900
RUNNING MARATHONS UNTIL

01:20:04.966 --> 01:20:06.768
SOMETHING HAPPENED TO HIS BACK.

01:20:06.835 --> 01:20:08.904
LET ME SIMPLY SAY THIS HE WAS A

MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES

SAID HE WAS DRIVING TO SEE RAY

01:20:18.246 --> 01:20:20.115
CORDOVA AS WE WERE HONORING HIM.

01:20:20.182 --> 01:20:21.950
AND I CALLED YOU AND SAID YOUR

01:20:22.017 --> 01:20:24.119
FATHER WAS DRIVING AND JUST WANT

01:20:24.186 --> 01:20:26.855
YOU TO KNOW WHERE HE WAS AT. AND

01:20:26.922 --> 01:20:29.691
THAT'S JUST WHO THIS GREAT MAN

01:20:29.758 --> 01:20:32.360
WAS. I SIMPLY WANT TO SAY TO YOU

01:20:32.427 --> 01:20:33.395
AND TO THIS GREAT FAMILY, THANK

01:20:33.461 --> 01:20:35.297
YOU FOR SHARING YOUR FATHER WITH

01:20:35.363 --> 01:20:37.232
ALL OF US. LOS ANGELES WOULD NOT

01:20:37.299 --> 01:20:40.135
BE LOS ANGELES WITHOUT A NATE

01:20:40.202 --> 01:20:42.370
HOLDEN. CHRIS. CALIFORNIA WOULD

01:20:42.437 --> 01:20:44.839
NOT BE CALIFORNIA WITHOUT HIM

01:20:44.906 --> 01:20:47.809

01:21:00.889 --> 01:21:01.723

REMINDER OF HOW FAR WE'VE COME,

01:31:37.291 --> 01:31:39.861
BUT HOW FAR WE NEED TO GO IN

01:31:39.927 --> 01:31:41.896
ORDER TO REACH REAL EQUALITY AND

01:31:41.963 --> 01:31:44.098

AMERICAN HISTORY. JUNETEENTH IS

01:32:03.751 --> 01:32:05.453
MORE THAN A HISTORICAL

01:32:05.519 --> 01:32:07.288
MILESTONE. IT IS A LIVING

01:32:07.355 --> 01:32:09.490
LEGACY, A CALL TO REFLECT, TO

01:32:09.557 --> 01:32:11.225

FREEDOM, HAS HELPED SHAPE THE

01:32:20.868 --> 01:32:23.571
DEMOCRATIC VALUES WE HOLD DEAR.

01:32:27.008 --> 01:32:28.042
WITH THE BLACK COMMUNITY NOT

01:32:28.109 --> 01:32:30.077
ONLY IN REMEMBRANCE BUT IN

01:32:30.144 --> 01:32:31.879
PURPOSE. OUR COMMUNITIES SHARE A

01:32:31.946 --> 01:32:33.281
LONG AND OFTEN PARALLEL HISTORY

01:32:33.347 --> 01:32:35.750
OF MARGINALIZATION, RESISTANCE

01:32:35.816 --> 01:32:38.052
AND HOPE. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE

01:32:38.119 --> 01:32:39.387
FIGHT FOR RACIAL EQUITY,

01:32:39.453 --> 01:32:41.589
ECONOMIC JUSTICE AND CIVIL

01:32:41.656 --> 01:32:43.357
RIGHTS IS ONE OF THE IS ONE WE

01:32:43.424 --> 01:32:45.760
MUST PURSUE TOGETHER WITH UNITY,

01:32:45.826 --> 01:32:48.462
WITH HUMILITY, AND WITH URGENCY.

01:32:48.529 --> 01:32:49.830
WE AFFIRM OUR COMMITMENT TO

01:32:49.897 --> 01:32:51.332
CONFRONTING SYSTEMIC RACISM IN

01:32:51.399 --> 01:32:53.868
ALL OF ITS FORMS, WHETHER IN OUR

01:32:53.935 --> 01:32:55.336

01:32:55.403 --> 01:32:58.306
OUR INSTITUTIONS. WE PLEDGE TO

POLICIES THAT UPLIFT OUR

01:33:01.042 --> 01:33:02.043
COMMUNITIES, ESPECIALLY THOSE

01:33:02.109 --> 01:33:03.444
WHO HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY

01:33:03.511 --> 01:33:06.047
EXCLUDED OR UNDERSERVED. LET

01:33:06.113 --> 01:33:08.582
THIS NOT BE ONLY A DAY OF

01:33:08.649 --> 01:33:09.850
REMEMBRANCE, BUT A REAFFIRMATION

01:33:09.917 --> 01:33:12.219
OF OUR SHARED RESPONSIBILITY TO

01:33:12.286 --> 01:33:13.654
BUILD A CALIFORNIA AND A NATION

01:33:13.721 --> 01:33:15.890
WHERE FREEDOM IS NOT DELAYED,

01:33:15.957 --> 01:33:17.892
WHERE JUSTICE IS NOT DENIED, AND

01:33:17.959 --> 01:33:19.226
WHERE THE DIGNITY OF EVERY

01:33:19.293 --> 01:33:21.195
PERSON IS FULLY RECOGNIZED AND

01:33:21.262 --> 01:33:23.297
PROTECTED. THANK YOU, AND MAY

01:33:23.364 --> 01:33:24.799
THIS DAY INSPIRE US ALL TO CARRY

01:33:24.865 --> 01:33:26.233
FORWARD THE WORK OF THOSE WHO

01:33:26.300 --> 01:33:28.369
CAME BEFORE US WITH COURAGE,

01:33:28.436 --> 01:33:31.138
COMPASSION AND CONVICTION. THANK

01:33:31.205 --> 01:33:33.674

01:33:33.741 --> 01:33:35.242
ASSEMBLY MEMBER WARD, YOU ARE

01:33:35.309 --> 01:33:38.846
RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MR.

01:33:38.913 --> 01:33:39.747
SPEAKER, ON BEHALF OF THE

01:33:39.814 --> 01:33:41.482
CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE JEWISH

01:33:41.549 --> 01:33:42.883
CAUCUS, I RISE IN SUPPORT TODAY

01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:44.919
OF ECR 90 RECOGNIZING

01:33:44.986 --> 01:33:46.354
JUNETEENTH. I'D LIKE TO THANK

01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:47.288
THE AUTHOR FROM LOS ANGELES AND

01:33:47.355 --> 01:33:48.923
THE ENTIRE BLACK CAUCUS FOR

01:33:48.990 --> 01:33:50.224
BRINGING FORWARD THIS IMPORTANT

01:33:50.291 --> 01:33:51.792
MEASURE. TODAY, WE ARE

01:33:51.859 --> 01:33:53.260
RECOGNIZING AND CELEBRATING THE

01:33:53.327 --> 01:33:54.395
LIBERATION OF AFRICAN AMERICAN

01:33:54.462 --> 01:33:56.764
SLAVES AT THE END OF THE CIVIL

01:33:56.831 --> 01:33:57.331
WAR, WHILE COMMEMORATING THE

01:33:57.398 --> 01:33:59.333
STRUGGLES FOR TRUE FREEDOM. IT'S

01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:00.768
IMPORTANT THAT WE REJOICE AND

01:34:00.835 --> 01:34:02.436
REFLECT ON THE MOMENT OF

01:34:02.503 --> 01:34:04.338
LIBERATION AS A HISTORICAL

01:34:04.405 --> 01:34:05.406
MILESTONE AND RECOGNIZE THAT

01:34:05.473 --> 01:34:07.975
THIS WAS ONLY THE FIRST STEP TO

01:34:08.042 --> 01:34:09.844
EQUALITY AND JUSTICE. THE SLAVES

01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:11.879
OF GALVESTON, TEXAS, HAD TO WAIT

01:34:11.946 --> 01:34:13.647
FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS AFTER

01:34:13.714 --> 01:34:14.949
LINCOLN'S DECREE TO RECEIVE WORD

01:34:15.016 --> 01:34:16.951
THAT THEY WERE FREED IN

01:34:17.018 --> 01:34:18.953
CALIFORNIA. IT WAS ALSO AN

01:34:19.020 --> 01:34:21.255
ADDITIONAL TWO YEARS BEFORE OUR

01:34:21.322 --> 01:34:22.656
FUGITIVE SLAVE LAWS WERE

01:34:22.723 --> 01:34:24.759
OFFICIALLY REPEALED. DESPITE THE

01:34:24.825 --> 01:34:26.394
EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION AND

01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:28.095
THE RATIFICATION OF THE 13TH

01:34:28.162 --> 01:34:29.697
AMENDMENT, THE STRUGGLE FOR

01:34:29.764 --> 01:34:31.132
EQUALITY FOR FORMER SLAVES,

01:34:31.198 --> 01:34:32.700
THEIR DESCENDANTS, AND AFRICAN

01:34:32.767 --> 01:34:34.035
AMERICANS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY

01:34:34.101 --> 01:34:36.437
HAS PROVEN LONG AND HARD. WHILE

01:34:36.504 --> 01:34:38.072
WE CELEBRATE OUR HARD FOUGHT

01:34:38.139 --> 01:34:40.408
VICTORIES, WE MUST RECOGNIZE THE

01:34:40.474 --> 01:34:41.776
DISCRIMINATION THAT PERSISTED IN

01:34:41.842 --> 01:34:42.810
OUR COMMUNITIES AFTER THE CIVIL

01:34:42.877 --> 01:34:45.012
WAR. AND THAT CONTINUES TODAY.

01:34:45.079 --> 01:34:46.414
AS WE COMMEMORATE JUNETEENTH

01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:48.082
TODAY, WE MUST BE COGNIZANT OF

01:34:48.149 --> 01:34:50.051
THE CONTINUED NEED TO COMBAT

01:34:50.117 --> 01:34:52.319
RACISM, HATE, AND INTOLERANCE.

01:34:52.386 --> 01:34:53.554
WE ARE WATCHING IN AGONY WHILE

01:34:53.621 --> 01:34:55.389
OUR SIBLINGS OF COLOR ARE AGAIN

01:34:55.456 --> 01:34:56.924
BEING TARGETED BY FORCES THAT

01:34:56.991 --> 01:34:59.360
PEDDLE IN RACIST TROPES. DESPITE

01:34:59.427 --> 01:35:01.062
STRONG LAWS IN CALIFORNIA

01:35:01.128 --> 01:35:02.263
PROTECTING AND UPLIFTING OUR

01:35:02.329 --> 01:35:03.864
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, THE

01:35:03.931 --> 01:35:04.799
FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION IS

01:35:04.865 --> 01:35:05.833
ATTACKING INDIVIDUALS AND

01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:07.034
FAMILIES AT THEIR PLACES OF

01:35:07.101 --> 01:35:09.003
WORK, AT THEIR CHILDREN'S

01:35:09.070 --> 01:35:09.870
GRADUATIONS, AND EVEN AT

01:35:09.937 --> 01:35:11.405
COURTHOUSES, WHILE THEY TRY TO

01:35:11.472 --> 01:35:12.740
FOLLOW THE LAW AND BECOMING

01:35:12.807 --> 01:35:14.341
CITIZENS OF OUR GREAT STATE AND

01:35:14.408 --> 01:35:15.943
COUNTRY. FEDERAL AGENCIES HAVE

01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:17.478
STOPPED RECOGNIZING MARTIN

01:35:17.545 --> 01:35:19.346
LUTHER KING JUNIOR DAY, BLACK

01:35:19.413 --> 01:35:21.449
HISTORY MONTH, AND JUNETEENTH.

01:35:21.515 --> 01:35:22.950
BLACK HEROES LIKE HARRIET TUBMAN

01:35:23.017 --> 01:35:24.618
AND OTHER WAR VETERANS HAVE BEEN

01:35:24.685 --> 01:35:27.088
HIDDEN OR DEVALUED. WE ARE

01:35:27.154 --> 01:35:28.889
WITNESSING A TERRIFYING

01:35:28.956 --> 01:35:30.724
BACKSLIDE IN MORALS, AND THIS

01:35:30.791 --> 01:35:32.593
LEGISLATURE MUST STAND STRONG TO

01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:35.029
TURN IT AROUND, AS WE SAW OVER

01:35:35.096 --> 01:35:36.997
100 YEARS AGO. AND AS WE ARE

01:35:37.064 --> 01:35:38.399
SEEING TODAY, GOOD LAWS ARE NOT

01:35:38.466 --> 01:35:39.433
JUST ENOUGH ON THEIR OWN TO

01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:41.102
ENSURE FREEDOM AND JUSTICE. IT

01:35:41.168 --> 01:35:42.937
TAKES GOOD PEOPLE TO UPHOLD

01:35:43.003 --> 01:35:44.738
JUSTICE TOGETHER, TO STAND FOR

01:35:44.805 --> 01:35:46.574
OUR VALUES AND STAND FOR EACH

01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:49.009
OTHER. THE JEWISH PEOPLE SAY

01:35:49.076 --> 01:35:50.978
LADORE VADOR, WHICH MEANS FROM

01:35:51.045 --> 01:35:52.746
GENERATION TO GENERATION, TO

01:35:52.813 --> 01:35:54.148
RECOGNIZE THE ROLE THAT WE PLAY

01:35:54.215 --> 01:35:55.282
IN SHAPING THE FUTURE, JUST AS

01:35:55.349 --> 01:35:57.351
WE ARE SHAPED BY THE PAST. AND

01:35:57.418 --> 01:35:59.053
SO WHILE WE CELEBRATE JUNETEENTH

01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:00.321
AS A PIVOTAL MOMENT IN HISTORY,

01:36:00.387 --> 01:36:02.456
WE COMMIT TO CONTINUED WORK TO

01:36:02.523 --> 01:36:04.225
MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT

01:36:04.291 --> 01:36:05.126
HAUNTED BY OUR PAST, BUT

01:36:05.192 --> 01:36:06.193
INSPIRED TO KEEP PROGRESS.

01:36:06.260 --> 01:36:07.928
MOVING FORWARD, WE COMMIT TO

01:36:07.995 --> 01:36:09.964
IMPROVE THE LIVES OF ALL OF OUR

01:36:10.030 --> 01:36:11.398
CHILDREN AND OUR CHILDREN'S

01:36:11.465 --> 01:36:12.600
CHILDREN. AND THAT SPIRIT, AND

01:36:12.666 --> 01:36:13.934
ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:36:14.001 --> 01:36:15.636
LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS, I

01:36:15.703 --> 01:36:17.571
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE

01:36:17.638 --> 01:36:19.340
ON H.R. 90. THANK YOU.

01:36:19.406 --> 01:36:21.242
ASSEMBLYMEMBER. WARD ASSEMBLY

01:36:21.308 --> 01:36:22.576
MEMBER BRIAN, YOU ARE

01:36:22.643 --> 01:36:27.214
RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MR.

01:36:27.281 --> 01:36:31.485
SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES. I'VE

01:36:31.552 --> 01:36:34.054
BEEN THINKING A LOT ABOUT ALL OF

01:36:34.121 --> 01:36:35.322
OUR STORIES AND ORIGIN STORIES

01:36:35.389 --> 01:36:37.725
AS PEOPLE WHO MAKE UP THIS, THIS

01:36:37.791 --> 01:36:41.295
COUNTRY AND HAVING A LOT OF

01:36:41.362 --> 01:36:41.929
CONVERSATIONS WITH COMMUNITIES.

01:36:41.996 --> 01:36:43.831
AND FOR BLACK AMERICANS, IT'S AN

01:36:43.898 --> 01:36:46.433
INTERESTING DISTINCTION. THERE

01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:48.202
WAS NO PATHWAY TO IMMIGRATION

01:36:48.269 --> 01:36:49.470
FOR BLACK AMERICANS. WE DIDN'T

01:36:49.537 --> 01:36:51.672
IMMIGRATE TO THIS COUNTRY. WE

01:36:51.739 --> 01:36:53.807
WERE STOLEN AND BROUGHT TO THIS

01:36:53.874 --> 01:36:55.776
COUNTRY. IMMIGRATION WAS A

01:36:55.843 --> 01:36:57.878
PATHWAY FOR PEOPLE. WE WERE

01:36:57.945 --> 01:37:00.748
THOUGHT OF AS PROPERTY, CHATTEL

01:37:00.814 --> 01:37:03.250
PROPERTY TO BE BOUGHT AND SOLD

01:37:03.317 --> 01:37:06.487
AND TRADED AND BEATEN AND RAPED

01:37:06.554 --> 01:37:10.591
AND MAIMED AND SO MUCH ELSE. I

01:37:10.658 --> 01:37:13.260
THINK ABOUT THE 13 GENERATIONS,

01:37:13.327 --> 01:37:15.329
NEARLY 14 GENERATIONS OF BLACK

01:37:15.396 --> 01:37:17.765
AMERICANS WHO WERE ENSLAVED AND

01:37:17.831 --> 01:37:19.400
PROHIBITED FROM READING AND

01:37:19.466 --> 01:37:21.669
WRITING. I THINK ABOUT THE DRED

01:37:21.735 --> 01:37:22.736
SCOTT CASE, A REMINDER THAT OUR

01:37:22.803 --> 01:37:24.505
COURTS ARE NOT INFALLIBLE. WHEN

01:37:24.572 --> 01:37:26.273
HE WAS DENIED HIS PERSONHOOD AT

01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:27.841
THE HIGHEST LEVEL AT THE SUPREME

01:37:27.908 --> 01:37:30.511
COURT, ALL OF THOSE THINGS HAVE

01:37:30.578 --> 01:37:33.681
ME REFLECTING ON TODAY, 160

01:37:33.747 --> 01:37:35.649
YEARS WE'VE BEEN CELEBRATING

01:37:35.716 --> 01:37:37.484
JUNETEENTH. THAT'S NOT NEARLY AS

01:37:37.551 --> 01:37:39.253
LONG AS WE WERE ENSLAVED IN THIS

01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:41.822
COUNTRY. THE ORIGINAL JUNETEENTH

01:37:41.889 --> 01:37:43.357
FLAG, BY THE WAY, IS RED, WHITE

01:37:43.424 --> 01:37:45.426
AND BLUE BECAUSE BLACK AMERICANS

01:37:45.492 --> 01:37:46.994
ARE FOUNDATIONAL TO THE BUILDING

01:37:47.061 --> 01:37:49.630
OF THIS COUNTRY. THERE IS NO

01:37:49.697 --> 01:37:52.233
AMERICA WITHOUT FOLKS WHO WERE

01:37:52.299 --> 01:37:55.536
ENSLAVED. THAT IS A TRUTH. IT'S

01:37:55.603 --> 01:37:57.705
ALSO A TRUTH THAT JUSTICE HAS

01:37:57.771 --> 01:37:59.773
FOREVER BEEN DELAYED FOR PEOPLE

01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:01.609
WHO WEREN'T ENSLAVED AND THEIR

01:38:01.675 --> 01:38:03.811
DESCENDANTS. THAT IS WHY

01:38:03.877 --> 01:38:05.579
JUNETEENTH IS A HOLIDAY. IT'S

01:38:05.646 --> 01:38:07.414
ALSO WHY IT ONLY BECAME A

01:38:07.481 --> 01:38:09.483
FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED HOLIDAY IN

01:38:09.550 --> 01:38:10.884
2020 AFTER THE MURDER OF GEORGE

01:38:10.951 --> 01:38:12.419
FLOYD. WE'VE BEEN CELEBRATING MY

01:38:12.486 --> 01:38:13.387
BROTHER FROM COMPTON, AND I HAVE

01:38:13.454 --> 01:38:15.756
BEEN CELEBRATING MUCH OF OUR

01:38:15.823 --> 01:38:18.425
LIFE, ESPECIALLY THOSE OF US

01:38:18.492 --> 01:38:22.062
THAT WERE BORN IN TEXAS OR HAVE

01:38:22.129 --> 01:38:23.897
TEXAS ROOTS. JUSTICE IS STILL

01:38:23.964 --> 01:38:25.866
DELAYED AND DENIED FOR

01:38:25.933 --> 01:38:26.734
DESCENDANTS OF THOSE WHO WERE

01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:28.602
ENSLAVED IN THIS COUNTRY. BUT

01:38:28.669 --> 01:38:30.304
I'M HOPEFUL BECAUSE WE ARE ON A

01:38:30.371 --> 01:38:32.606
ROAD TO REPAIR, AND IT'S A ROAD

01:38:32.673 --> 01:38:34.775
THAT REQUIRES MANY ALLIES AND A

01:38:34.842 --> 01:38:36.577
STRONG COMMITMENT ROOTED IN

01:38:36.644 --> 01:38:38.379
TRUTH AND JUSTICE AND

01:38:38.445 --> 01:38:40.047
OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL. AND I

01:38:40.114 --> 01:38:41.081
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE

01:38:41.148 --> 01:38:43.384

EQUALITY, EQUITY AND LIBERATION

01:39:09.310 --> 01:39:12.079

01:39:12.146 --> 01:39:15.349

WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO,

01:39:33.434 --> 01:39:36.537
AND IN MANY CASES TODAY, WE WILL

01:39:36.603 --> 01:39:39.106
STILL HAVE TO BACKTRACK TO

01:39:39.173 --> 01:39:41.008
RECOVER FROM THE VICTORIES AND

01:39:41.075 --> 01:39:43.844

01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:54.888
EXAMINE OUR COUNTRY'S AND OUR

01:39:54.955 --> 01:39:57.491

01:39:57.558 --> 01:39:59.927
SLAVERY AND ENGAGE IN MEANINGFUL

01:39:59.993 --> 01:40:01.729

CONTINUES TO IMPACT US TODAY,

01:40:05.833 --> 01:40:08.769
BUT ALSO UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS

01:40:08.836 --> 01:40:11.872
HISTORY DOES NOT ONLY IMPACT

01:40:11.939 --> 01:40:14.742
AFRICAN AMERICANS, IT IMPACTS

01:40:14.808 --> 01:40:16.710
EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT HAS

01:40:16.777 --> 01:40:17.845
GONE THROUGH THIS PUBLIC

01:40:17.911 --> 01:40:20.781

EVERYONE WHO'S BEEN CONDITIONED

01:40:23.117 --> 01:40:25.285
TO THINK ABOUT WHO'S WORTHY AND

01:40:25.352 --> 01:40:27.721
WHO'S NOT WORTHY, WHO'S

01:40:27.788 --> 01:40:29.256

01:40:37.564 --> 01:40:39.566

01:40:55.115 --> 01:40:58.685
IN OUR VERY OWN SLAVERY SYSTEM

01:40:58.752 --> 01:41:02.322
HERE IN THIS COUNTRY. AND SO WE

01:41:02.389 --> 01:41:05.092

LIBERATE OUR OWN ACTIONS, TO

01:41:12.833 --> 01:41:15.269
LIBERATE OUR OWN THINKING, SO

01:41:15.335 --> 01:41:17.137

01:41:26.447 --> 01:41:28.682
ENSURE THAT FUTURE GENERATIONS

01:41:28.749 --> 01:41:30.584
ARE NOT BORN WITH THE SHACKLES

01:41:30.651 --> 01:41:33.654
OF SUCH DISCRIMINATION,

01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:36.890
ANTI-BLACKNESS AND ANTI HATE,

02:00:30.723 --> 02:00:32.491
TRYING TIMES FOR OUR COMMUNITY,

02:00:32.558 --> 02:00:34.393
BEING ABLE TO COME TOGETHER,

02:00:34.460 --> 02:00:39.398
BEING ABLE TO TRULY, REALLY FIND

02:00:39.465 --> 02:00:41.968
SPACES ALL OVER. THIS WEEKEND'S

02:00:42.034 --> 02:00:43.970
NÓ KING'S PROTEST, YOU HEARD

02:00:44.036 --> 02:00:45.771
MUSIC EVERYWHERE YOU WENT, AND I

02:00:45.838 --> 02:00:48.074
THINK ELECTRONIC DANCE MUSIC IN

02:00:48.140 --> 02:00:49.475
PARTICULAR. AS WE THINK ABOUT

02:00:49.542 --> 02:00:51.310
EDM, WE THINK ABOUT THE

02:00:51.377 --> 02:00:54.680
ELECTRONIC DANCE CARNIVAL EDC,

02:00:54.747 --> 02:00:56.549
WHICH STARTED IN OUR DISTRICT IN

02:00:56.616 --> 02:00:59.151
LOS ANGELES. IT JUST SPEAKS

02:00:59.218 --> 02:01:01.153
VOLUMES THAT IT'S NOW ALL AROUND

02:01:01.220 --> 02:01:04.123
THE WORLD. AND THE IMPORTANCE OF

02:01:04.190 --> 02:01:07.360
BEING ABLE TO HAVE INCREDIBLE

02:01:07.426 --> 02:01:09.695
REVENUE STREAMS FROM PLACES THAT

02:01:09.762 --> 02:01:11.464
ARE DOING THAT KIND OF WORK ALL

02:01:11.530 --> 02:01:13.299
OVER, NOT ONLY LOS ANGELES AND

02:01:13.366 --> 02:01:15.401
CALIFORNIA, BUT THROUGHOUT,

02:01:15.468 --> 02:01:17.436
MEANS SO MUCH TO OUR COMMUNITIES

02:01:17.503 --> 02:01:18.738
AND TO EVEN THE SMALL BUSINESSES

02:01:18.804 --> 02:01:21.240
THAT CAN SUPPORT IN THAT WAY.

02:01:21.307 --> 02:01:23.576
AND I JUST WANT TO CLOSE BY

02:01:23.643 --> 02:01:25.811
SAYING MY FAVORITE EDM SONG IS

02:01:25.878 --> 02:01:28.414
BY ALOE BLACC AND AVICII. IT'S

02:01:28.481 --> 02:01:30.516
WAKE ME UP WHEN IT'S ALL OVER. I

02:01:30.583 --> 02:01:32.518
THINK THAT'S THE NAME OF IT, BUT

02:01:32.585 --> 02:01:33.586
MAYBE I'M WRONG. IT'S AN

02:01:33.653 --> 02:01:34.887
INCREDIBLE SONG AND

02:01:34.954 --> 02:01:36.022
UNFORTUNATELY, AVICII PASSED

02:01:36.088 --> 02:01:38.024
AWAY, I BELIEVE, A FEW YEARS

02:01:38.090 --> 02:01:39.558
AGO. BUT HE LEFT US WITH A

02:01:39.625 --> 02:01:41.961
REALLY BEAUTIFUL QUOTE THAT SAYS,

02:01:42.028 --> 02:01:45.197
MUSIC HAS THE POWER TO HEAL AND

02:01:45.264 --> 02:01:46.399

02:02:06.318 --> 02:02:08.421
AND WE THINK IT BRINGS TOGETHER

02:02:08.487 --> 02:02:09.588
COMMUNITY. FOR ME, I THINK ABOUT

02:02:09.655 --> 02:02:11.357
HOW I WORK OUT. I LISTEN TO EDM

02:02:11.424 --> 02:02:13.592

THE SOUNDTRACK OF THEIR WORKOUT.

02:03:40.179 --> 02:03:42.047

THIRD WEEK OF JUNE. I INTRODUCED

02:12:11.056 --> 02:12:13.058
THIS RESOLUTION FOR A COUPLE OF

02:12:13.125 --> 02:12:14.860
REASONS. FIRST, ANIMALS HAVE

02:12:14.926 --> 02:12:16.762
BEEN A MEANINGFUL PART OF EVERY

02:12:16.828 --> 02:12:18.597

WE CAN ALL RELATE TO THE COMFORT

02:12:20.699 --> 02:12:22.267
THAT COMES FROM BEING GREETED BY

02:12:22.334 --> 02:12:23.735
A BELOVED PET AFTER A LONG,

02:12:23.802 --> 02:12:25.437
TOUGH DAY. IT'S LIKE THE WEIGHT

02:12:25.504 --> 02:12:27.773
OF THE WORLD LIFTS UP OFF OUR

02:12:27.839 --> 02:12:29.308
SHOULDERS, EVEN JUST FOR A

02:12:29.374 --> 02:12:31.410
MOMENT. ANIMALS HAVE A SPECIAL

02:12:31.476 --> 02:12:33.045
ABILITY TO SENSE OUR EMOTIONS

02:12:33.111 --> 02:12:34.980
AND MEET US RIGHT WHERE WE ARE

02:12:35.047 --> 02:12:36.815
WITHOUT JUDGMENT. WHETHER WE'RE

02:12:36.882 --> 02:12:39.351
FEELING JOYFUL OR DOWN.

02:12:39.418 --> 02:12:40.452
HONESTLY, IF MORE PEOPLE ACTED

02:12:40.519 --> 02:12:42.387
LIKE OUR PETS IN THAT WAY, THE

02:12:42.454 --> 02:12:44.723
WORLD MIGHT BE A KINDER PLACE.

02:12:44.790 --> 02:12:46.591
THE SECOND REASON IS THE

02:12:46.658 --> 02:12:48.293
INCREDIBLE WORK I'VE SEEN FROM

02:12:48.360 --> 02:12:49.695

INTO LAW. I'VE. I HAVE HAD THE

02:13:04.910 --> 02:13:07.112
HONOR OF CARRYING TWO OF THOSE

02:13:07.179 --> 02:13:09.281
BILLS MYSELF BACK HOME IN MY

FINDING THEM LOVING HOMES, AND

02:13:20.559 --> 02:13:21.793
PROMOTING SPAY AND NEUTER

02:13:21.860 --> 02:13:24.296

02:13:24.363 --> 02:13:27.065

02:13:27.132 --> 02:13:28.700
FEW EXAMPLES OF THE DEDICATED

ANIMAL ADVOCATES WERE BLESSED TO

HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. WHETHER IT'S

02:13:32.604 --> 02:13:34.806
A NONPROFIT LEADER,

02:13:34.873 --> 02:13:36.208

OFFICERS, I'M PROUD TO SUPPORT

02:13:40.145 --> 02:13:41.613
THEIR WORK, THEIR IMPORTANT

02:13:41.680 --> 02:13:44.850
WORK. AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE

HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO STEWARD

SHARE IT WITH US. WE MAY EACH

02:13:50.756 --> 02:13:52.491
DEFINE STEWARDSHIP A LITTLE

02:13:52.557 --> 02:13:53.859
DIFFERENTLY, BUT I THINK WE CAN

02:13:53.925 --> 02:13:55.727

CREATED A UNIQUE CULTURE FOR

02:25:44.869 --> 02:25:47.205
TEENS BATTLING CANCER. WHETHER

02:25:47.271 --> 02:25:48.573
IT WAS THROUGH DELIVERING

02:25:59.584 --> 02:26:01.919
LEFT A LASTING IMPACT IN THE

02:26:12.096 --> 02:26:14.866
HERE WITH US WAS SHORT, SHE WILL

02:26:14.932 --> 02:26:16.400
CONTINUE TO TOUCH THE LIVES OF

02:26:16.467 --> 02:26:18.536
THOSE THAT KNEW HER. HER LEGACY

02:26:18.603 --> 02:26:20.271

JUST FOR THE IMPACT THAT SHE HAD

02:26:49.567 --> 02:26:50.468
