REALLY TRY. I FOUND THAT IF WE

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:19.769

01:02:19.836 --> 01:02:21.804
MORE AWARE OF OUR COMPLAINING

01:02:21.871 --> 01:02:24.540

01:23:52.827 --> 01:23:53.995
RESTRICTIONS REGARDING WHO GETS

01:23:54.062 --> 01:23:55.363
THIS MONEY HAVEN'T BEEN

01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:57.399
DETERMINED YET. IT IS IMPERATIVE

01:23:57.465 --> 01:23:59.634
THAT POOR AND UNDERSERVED RURAL

01:23:59.701 --> 01:24:00.668
COUNTIES RECEIVE THE FUNDING

01:24:00.735 --> 01:24:02.871
THEY NEED. I'VE SPOKEN WITH MY

01:24:02.937 --> 01:24:04.406
LOCAL COUNTIES, AND THIS MONEY

01:24:04.472 --> 01:24:06.241
IS ESSENTIAL TO KEEPING PEOPLE

01:24:06.307 --> 01:24:08.877
OFF THE STREETS. IN MY DISTRICT,

01:24:08.943 --> 01:24:10.478
WE DO THE WORK, WE ARE

01:24:10.545 --> 01:24:11.913
ACCOUNTABLE WITH TAXPAYERS

01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:13.114
MONIES, AND WE STRETCH EVERY

01:24:13.181 --> 01:24:15.483
DOLLAR WE GET. RURAL COMMUNITIES

01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:17.986
MUST HAVE ACCESS TO THESE FUNDS.

01:24:18.052 --> 01:24:19.421
DESPITE THESE CONCERNS, THERE

01:24:19.487 --> 01:24:20.855
ARE MEANINGFUL PROVISIONS IN

01:24:20.922 --> 01:24:22.590

MAINTAIN ESSENTIAL SERVICES, AND

01:24:30.098 --> 01:24:31.866
GIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE TOOLS

01:24:31.933 --> 01:24:34.536
THEY NEED TO GET MORE HOUSING

01:24:34.602 --> 01:24:36.371
BUILT. THAT'S WHY I AM

01:24:36.438 --> 01:24:37.605

THIS PROVISION. OVER 100

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.468
ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS HAVE

SIGNED A LETTER IN STRONG

01:25:42.403 --> 01:25:45.807
OPPOSITION TO SB 131, STATING

01:25:45.874 --> 01:25:49.444
THIS BILL IS THE WORST

01:25:49.511 --> 01:25:51.312
ANTI-ENVIRONMENTAL BILL IN

THIS CEQA EXEMPTION FOR ADVANCED

01:26:26.781 --> 01:26:27.715
MANUFACTURING. NOW, WHAT DOES

01:26:27.782 --> 01:26:29.751
THAT MEAN? ADVANCED

01:26:29.817 --> 01:26:32.186
MANUFACTURING? WE KNOW ACCORDING

01:26:32.253 --> 01:26:35.089
TO THESE LETTERS THAT WE'VE

01:26:35.156 --> 01:26:37.292
RECEIVED THAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST

01:26:37.358 --> 01:26:40.495
CONCERNS IS IN THE ENGINE OF OUR

01:26:40.562 --> 01:26:42.964
STATE'S ECONOMY, SILICON VALLEY

01:26:43.031 --> 01:26:45.500
IN PARTICULAR, WITH THE

01:26:45.567 --> 01:26:47.268
SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING THAT

01:26:47.335 --> 01:26:50.271
TAKES PLACE IN SILICON VALLEY.

01:26:50.338 --> 01:26:52.373
THERE'S A REASON WHY 23

01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:55.610
SUPERFUND SITES EXIST IN THE

01:26:55.677 --> 01:26:58.146
SANTA CLARA COUNTY, AND THAT IS

01:26:58.212 --> 01:27:00.582
BECAUSE OF MUCH OF THIS HIGH

01:27:00.648 --> 01:27:03.618
TECH MANUFACTURING THAT TAKES

01:27:03.685 --> 01:27:06.354
PLACE. SEMICONDUCTOR

01:27:06.421 --> 01:27:08.189
MANUFACTURING, FOR EXAMPLE, IS

01:27:08.256 --> 01:27:10.158
NOTORIOUS FOR ITS EXTENSIVE USE

01:27:10.224 --> 01:27:13.294
OF TOXIC PFAS, THE FOREVER

01:27:13.361 --> 01:27:15.463
CHEMICALS THAT WE HAVE BEEN

01:27:15.530 --> 01:27:17.765
INTRODUCING BILLS TO TRY TO

01:27:17.832 --> 01:27:20.802
ELIMINATE FROM OUR WATER

01:27:20.868 --> 01:27:22.770
SUPPLIES. THAT IS JUST ONE OF

01:27:22.837 --> 01:27:25.740
MANY EXAMPLES IN MY DISTRICT,

01:27:25.807 --> 01:27:28.309
LOS ANGELES COUNTY, HOME TO ONE

01:27:28.376 --> 01:27:29.811
OF THE BIGGEST CENTERS OF

01:27:29.877 --> 01:27:31.312
AEROSPACE MANUFACTURING. THE

01:27:31.379 --> 01:27:33.414
SAME THING APPLIES WHILE WE TALK

01:27:33.481 --> 01:27:35.650
ABOUT ADVANCED MANUFACTURING AS

01:27:35.717 --> 01:27:38.820
BEING SOMEHOW CLEANER THAN

01:27:38.886 --> 01:27:40.622
TRADITIONAL MANUFACTURING, THAT

01:27:40.688 --> 01:27:46.761
IS SIMPLY NOT THE CASE. AND SO.

01:27:46.828 --> 01:27:51.733
IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE

01:27:51.799 --> 01:27:54.969
GOVERNOR AND THE SENATE HAVE

01:27:55.036 --> 01:27:58.640

01:27:58.706 --> 01:28:08.683

01:28:47.855 --> 01:28:50.158
PORTIONS OF SB 131 THAT PROVIDE

01:28:50.224 --> 01:28:51.959
EXEMPTIONS TO THE CALIFORNIA

ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT, BOTH

01:28:53.928 --> 01:28:54.762

ORGANIZATIONS AND LABOR UNIONS

01:28:55.997 --> 01:28:57.331
HAVE RAISED WHAT I CONSIDER TO

01:28:57.398 --> 01:28:59.267
BE SOME LEGITIMATE ISSUES ABOUT

01:28:59.333 --> 01:29:02.804

01:29:11.813 --> 01:29:13.915
OUTCOMES TO PROTECT HEALTH CARE,

01:29:13.981 --> 01:29:15.349

CRUCIAL TO UPLIFT OUR MOST

01:29:17.518 --> 01:29:18.052
VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS. IT'S

01:29:18.119 --> 01:29:19.320
ESSENTIAL THAT OUR BUDGET

REFLECTS OUR CALIFORNIA VALUES.

01:29:21.689 --> 01:29:23.257

COMMITMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO

01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:34.102
REVISIT THE ADVANCED

01:29:34.168 --> 01:29:35.603

DON'T OFTEN SPEAK ON MATTERS OF

01:29:51.085 --> 01:29:54.622
THE BUDGET, AND IN BIG PART

01:29:54.689 --> 01:29:56.791
BECAUSE AND AGAIN THIS YEAR,

01:29:56.858 --> 01:29:58.392
CERTAINLY, I THINK OUR BUDGET

01:29:58.459 --> 01:29:59.560
CHAIR AND SPEAKER HAVE DONE A

01:29:59.627 --> 01:30:01.896
TREMENDOUS JOB IN HAVING A

01:30:01.963 --> 01:30:04.332
PROCESS THAT HAS ALLOWED FOR OUR

01:30:04.398 --> 01:30:06.567
INPUT AND ALLOWED FOR THE

01:30:06.634 --> 01:30:08.636
OPPORTUNITY FOR CONCERNS TO BE

01:30:08.703 --> 01:30:09.604
RAISED. AND FOR THAT, I'M

01:30:09.670 --> 01:30:12.640
INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL. I DO WANT

01:30:12.707 --> 01:30:16.611
TO ALSO JUST HOPE AS WE MOVE

01:30:16.677 --> 01:30:17.645
FORWARD, I KNOW THAT THERE HAVE

01:30:17.712 --> 01:30:19.113
BEEN COMMITMENTS TO CONTINUE

01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:20.515
WORKING ON. SOME OF THE ISSUES

01:30:20.581 --> 01:30:22.650
THAT ARE OF THAT HAVE BEEN

01:30:22.717 --> 01:30:24.786
RAISED, OF CONCERN. AND SO I

01:30:24.852 --> 01:30:28.489
HOPE AS THIS BILL, IF IT DOES

01:30:28.556 --> 01:30:29.924
MOVE FORWARD, AS I PRESUME IT

01:30:29.991 --> 01:30:31.292
WILL, THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO

01:30:31.359 --> 01:30:34.662
WORK ON ISSUES REGARDING HABITAT

01:30:34.729 --> 01:30:38.166
PROTECTION, PARTICULARLY FOR

01:30:38.232 --> 01:30:40.334
PROTECTED SPECIES. AND I ALSO

01:30:40.401 --> 01:30:41.569
WANT TO RAISE THE ISSUE THAT WAS

01:30:41.636 --> 01:30:43.504
RAISED BY OUR COLLEAGUE FROM

01:30:43.571 --> 01:30:45.006
TORRANCE, BEING A REPRESENTATIVE

01:30:45.072 --> 01:30:46.407
FROM SANTA CLARA COUNTY, HAVING

01:30:46.474 --> 01:30:48.876
LIVED THERE FOR ALMOST HALF A

01:30:48.943 --> 01:30:50.077
CENTURY, I CAN REMEMBER THE

01:30:50.144 --> 01:30:51.913
EARLY DAYS OF SILICON VALLEY AS

01:30:51.979 --> 01:30:53.714
IT WAS MAKING ITS TRANSITION

01:30:53.781 --> 01:30:55.750
FROM THE VALLEY OF HEART'S

01:30:55.817 --> 01:30:57.585
DELIGHT AS SOME OF THE BEST

01:30:57.652 --> 01:30:58.653
AGRICULTURAL LAND IN THE WORLD,

01:30:58.719 --> 01:31:01.489
TO WHAT WE KNOW NOW AS SILICON

01:31:01.556 --> 01:31:03.357
VALLEY. AND OUR COLLEAGUE IS

01:31:03.424 --> 01:31:05.459
CORRECT A LOT. THERE'S BEEN A

01:31:05.526 --> 01:31:07.562
LOT OF LITIGATION, THERE'S BEEN

01:31:07.628 --> 01:31:11.232
A LOT OF DAMAGE THAT WAS DONE,

01:31:11.299 --> 01:31:13.301
ESPECIALLY DURING THE EARLY DAYS

01:31:13.367 --> 01:31:16.270
OF SILICON VALLEY THAT ALLOWED

01:31:16.337 --> 01:31:18.472
THIS STATE AND THIS NATION TO BE

01:31:18.539 --> 01:31:20.641
PROPELLED AS LEADERS IN THE

01:31:20.708 --> 01:31:22.443
TECHNOLOGY SECTOR. THAT CAME

01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:25.012
WITH COSTS. AND MUCH OF THOSE

01:31:25.079 --> 01:31:26.781
COSTS WERE ENVIRONMENTAL DEALT

01:31:26.848 --> 01:31:29.183
WITH, ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE. AND

01:31:29.250 --> 01:31:33.321
SO I JUST ASK THAT AS WE MOVE

01:31:33.387 --> 01:31:36.257
FORWARD, THAT WE COMMIT TO ONE

01:31:36.324 --> 01:31:38.626
ANOTHER AND THAT, AS OUR

01:31:38.693 --> 01:31:40.361
LEADERSHIP HAS HAS INDICATED, AS

01:31:40.428 --> 01:31:43.130
THESE CONVERSATIONS CONTINUE,

01:31:43.197 --> 01:31:46.868
THAT WE FIND AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:31:46.934 --> 01:31:49.337
NARROW SOME OF THE EXEMPTIONS,

01:31:49.403 --> 01:31:51.339
PARTICULARLY AS IT APPLIES TO

01:31:51.405 --> 01:31:54.141
ADVANCED MANUFACTURING, JUST

01:31:54.208 --> 01:31:56.244
RATHER THAN HAVING A BROAD

01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:58.012
EXEMPTION TO TAKE US BACK, I

01:31:58.079 --> 01:32:01.249
THINK, TO DAYS IN THE PAST THAT

01:32:01.315 --> 01:32:03.851
WERE NOT GOOD FOR OUR COMMUNITY

01:32:03.918 --> 01:32:05.620
AND ACTUALLY MAY HAVE COST US AS

01:32:05.686 --> 01:32:08.289
A STATE, A LOT MORE RESOURCES TO

01:32:08.356 --> 01:32:09.557
CLEAN UP SOME OF THE DAMAGE

01:32:09.624 --> 01:32:12.126
DONE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

01:32:12.193 --> 01:32:13.794

VALLEY, I JUST WOULD BE REMISS

01:33:25.533 --> 01:33:27.335

WE'RE ALSO DOING, SO RECOGNIZING

01:33:42.817 --> 01:33:44.919
THAT WE CANNOT STIFLE INNOVATION

01:33:44.986 --> 01:33:47.421
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN

01:33:47.488 --> 01:33:50.624
MY DISTRICT ALONE, BILLIONS AND

01:33:50.691 --> 01:33:52.059

HELP FUND SO MANY THINGS THAT

01:33:58.265 --> 01:33:59.600
CALIFORNIANS CARE ABOUT. AND WE

01:33:59.667 --> 01:34:02.536
MUST NOT STIFLE INNOVATION. WE

01:34:02.603 --> 01:34:04.338
MUST PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT. WE

01:34:04.405 --> 01:34:06.240
MUST DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO

01:34:06.307 --> 01:34:10.077

01:34:10.144 --> 01:34:11.612

THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. I RISE

01:37:31.579 --> 01:37:34.949
IN OPPOSITION TO SB 139. MY

01:37:35.015 --> 01:37:37.484
COMMENTS ON 139 REALLY APPLY TO

01:37:37.551 --> 01:37:40.421
THE ENTIRETY OF OUR LABOR

01:37:40.487 --> 01:37:43.123
NEGOTIATIONS. WE ARE IN A BUDGET

01:37:43.190 --> 01:37:46.527
CRISIS AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST

01:37:46.594 --> 01:37:47.661
DRIVERS OF OUR BUDGET CRISIS ARE

01:37:47.728 --> 01:37:50.431
OUR UNCONTROLLED LABOR COSTS. WE

01:37:50.497 --> 01:37:52.266
KNOW THAT THE LABOR UNIONS HAVE

01:37:52.333 --> 01:37:55.536
A LOT OF PULL, BUT IT IS

01:37:55.603 --> 01:37:58.072
INCUMBENT UPON US AS LEGISLATORS

01:37:58.138 --> 01:38:00.007
TO LEARN TO SAY THE WORD NO. AND

01:38:00.074 --> 01:38:01.675
THE GOVERNOR OBVIOUSLY NEEDS TO

01:38:01.742 --> 01:38:03.510
LEARN TO SAY NO. WE HAVE TO BE

01:38:03.577 --> 01:38:08.115
THE CHECK. AND THERE IS NO WAY

01:38:08.182 --> 01:38:10.951
TO DEFEND THE MAS YEAR AFTER

01:38:11.018 --> 01:38:12.453
YEAR, WITH SOME OF THE

01:38:12.519 --> 01:38:13.354
PROVISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ADDED

01:38:13.420 --> 01:38:17.091
IN THAT ABSOLUTELY ARE

01:38:17.157 --> 01:38:18.626
UNNECESSARY AND FRANKLY,

01:38:18.692 --> 01:38:19.627
WASTEFUL. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

01:38:19.693 --> 01:38:22.129
LOCAL LABOR MARKET. LOOK, I

01:38:22.196 --> 01:38:24.265
VALUE OUR EMPLOYEES AS A

01:38:24.331 --> 01:38:25.532
BUSINESSMAN, AND MANY OF YOU

01:38:25.599 --> 01:38:26.834
HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN

01:38:26.900 --> 01:38:29.436
YOUR BUSINESS CAREERS. WE ARE

01:38:29.503 --> 01:38:32.673
ONLY AS STRONG AS OUR WORKFORCE.

01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:33.907
TALENT MANAGEMENT, RECRUITMENT

01:38:33.974 --> 01:38:37.711
AND RETENTION. BUT IF WE ARE

01:38:37.778 --> 01:38:38.979
OVERCOMPENSATING FOR POSITIONS,

01:38:39.046 --> 01:38:40.981
IT MEANS THAT WE'RE NOT ABLE TO

01:38:41.048 --> 01:38:44.218
GIVE A JOB TO SOMEONE ELSE. IF

01:38:44.285 --> 01:38:46.220
WE ARE REWARDING POOR PERFORMERS

01:38:46.287 --> 01:38:48.455
AT THE SAME LEVEL THAT WE ARE

01:38:48.522 --> 01:38:50.391
COMPENSATING HIGH PERFORMERS, WE

01:38:50.457 --> 01:38:52.159
ARE SENDING THE WRONG MESSAGE

01:38:52.226 --> 01:38:53.894
AND WE ARE DISINCENTIVIZING OUR

01:38:53.961 --> 01:38:57.965
BEST PERFORMERS. THESE MOUS DO

01:38:58.032 --> 01:38:59.400
THAT AND MORE. WHEN YOU

01:38:59.466 --> 01:39:01.168
BENCHMARK OUR LOCAL LABOR COSTS

01:39:01.235 --> 01:39:02.870
AGAINST WHAT WE'RE PAYING STATE

01:39:02.936 --> 01:39:05.773
WORKERS, WE ARE FAR ABOVE WHAT

01:39:05.839 --> 01:39:08.842
THE LOCAL LABOR MARKETS ARE

01:39:08.909 --> 01:39:11.979
PAYING FOR COMPARABLE WORK. BUT

01:39:12.046 --> 01:39:13.614
WHAT IS PARTICULARLY CONCERNING

01:39:13.681 --> 01:39:16.283
ABOUT THESE MAS THIS YEAR ARE

01:39:16.350 --> 01:39:17.785
NOT JUST THE SALARY INCREASES.

01:39:17.851 --> 01:39:19.520
AND I WOULD POINT OUT THAT IT'S

01:39:19.586 --> 01:39:22.156
NOT A 3% ACROSS THE BOARD. EACH

01:39:22.222 --> 01:39:23.891
OF THESE EMPLOYEE GROUPS HAVE

01:39:23.957 --> 01:39:25.526
WHAT WE CALL STEP INCREASES. SO

01:39:25.592 --> 01:39:27.695
THEY'RE ALREADY GETTING A SALARY

01:39:27.761 --> 01:39:29.797
INCREASE EACH YEAR BASED ON THE

01:39:29.863 --> 01:39:31.332
STEP STRUCTURE. WHAT WE'RE

01:39:31.398 --> 01:39:33.267
GIVING ACROSS THE BOARD IS AN

01:39:33.334 --> 01:39:35.602
ADDITIONAL SALARY INCREASE AT

01:39:35.669 --> 01:39:39.173
TAXPAYERS EXPENSE. BUT WE ARE

01:39:39.239 --> 01:39:40.341
LITERALLY NOT PAYING OUR

01:39:40.407 --> 01:39:42.376
MORTGAGE PAYMENT FOR OPEB. THESE

01:39:42.443 --> 01:39:45.012
ARE THE RETIREE HEALTH CARE

01:39:45.079 --> 01:39:46.880
COSTS. THESE ARE NOT PART OF

01:39:46.947 --> 01:39:48.982
CALPERS OR CALSTRS. THESE ARE

01:39:49.049 --> 01:39:52.186
COSTS THAT GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN

01:39:52.252 --> 01:39:54.021
RIGHTFULLY SAID WE NEED TO START

01:39:54.088 --> 01:39:55.989
SOCKING MONEY AWAY FOR. WE HAVE

01:39:56.056 --> 01:39:57.558
TO PAY FOR THESE COSTS IN THE

01:39:57.624 --> 01:40:01.028
YEAR IN WHICH WE GET THE BENEFIT

01:40:01.095 --> 01:40:02.463
OF THE SERVICE OF THE EMPLOYEE.

01:40:02.529 --> 01:40:03.731
OTHERWISE, WE ARE PUTTING THEIR

01:40:03.797 --> 01:40:05.132
HEALTH CARE BENEFITS IN JEOPARDY

01:40:05.199 --> 01:40:08.535
FAR INTO THE FUTURE. MORE

01:40:08.602 --> 01:40:10.571
IMPORTANTLY, WE ARE SIGNING UP

01:40:10.637 --> 01:40:11.939
TAXPAYERS IN THE FUTURE FOR A

01:40:12.005 --> 01:40:16.710
MUCH LARGER BILL. SO THESE MAS

01:40:16.777 --> 01:40:18.812
LITERALLY HAVE A MORTGAGE THAT

01:40:18.879 --> 01:40:20.414
IS DUE THIS YEAR FOR THESE

01:40:20.481 --> 01:40:22.015

EXPONENTIALLY IN THE FUTURE. BUT

01:40:34.762 --> 01:40:36.196

01:40:45.672 --> 01:40:47.441
THINK HE WENT ALONG WITH THIS

01:40:47.508 --> 01:40:48.642

ACCURATE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY,

01:56:00.219 --> 01:56:01.854
AND ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO

01:56:01.921 --> 01:56:03.656
MANZANAR TEACHING THE LESSONS OF

THE MAJESTY OF THE REDWOODS ON

01:56:42.128 --> 01:56:43.830

FOREST THAT CONTAINS NEARLY 50%

01:56:50.136 --> 01:56:51.904

CONTINUE TO EXIST ON THIS

01:56:53.406 --> 01:56:55.575
PLANET, GENERATES ABOUT $42

01:56:55.641 --> 01:56:57.543
MILLION IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY

01:56:57.610 --> 01:56:59.846
EACH AND EVERY YEAR. IT SUSTAINS

01:56:59.912 --> 01:57:02.181
ABOUT 200 JOBS IN OUR LOCAL

01:57:02.248 --> 01:57:04.684

01:57:04.751 --> 01:57:05.885
CO-MANAGEMENT BETWEEN THE

01:57:05.952 --> 01:57:06.986

01:57:07.053 --> 01:57:08.755

ONE OF THOSE PARTNERS FALLS

01:57:17.830 --> 01:57:19.866
DOWN, THAT PUTS MORE PRESSURE ON

01:57:19.932 --> 01:57:21.501
THE OTHER. AND IN THIS CASE,

01:57:21.567 --> 01:57:22.935
THAT MEANS THE STATE HAVING TO

01:57:23.002 --> 01:57:24.937
PICK UP THE SLACK. SO I RISE IN

01:57:25.004 --> 01:57:26.506

01:57:26.572 --> 01:57:28.908

RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MR.

02:02:56.202 --> 02:02:57.536
SPEAKER. COLLEAGUES, TODAY I

02:02:57.603 --> 02:03:01.173
RISE IN RECOGNITION OF THE 249TH

02:03:01.240 --> 02:03:02.508
ANNIVERSARY OF THE ADOPTION OF

02:03:02.575 --> 02:03:04.310
THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE,

02:03:04.376 --> 02:03:06.245
WE STAND TOGETHER TO COMMEMORATE

02:03:06.312 --> 02:03:07.613
ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:09.215
MOMENTS IN THE HISTORY OF OUR

02:03:09.281 --> 02:03:10.716
NATION THE BIRTH OF OUR

02:03:10.783 --> 02:03:13.486
REPUBLIC. ON THE 4TH OF JULY,

02:03:13.552 --> 02:03:16.255
1776. ON THIS DAY, OUR FOUNDERS

02:03:16.322 --> 02:03:18.858
DECLARED THAT ALL MEN AND NOW WE

02:03:18.924 --> 02:03:20.259
KNOW ALL PEOPLE ARE CREATED

02:03:20.326 --> 02:03:21.927
EQUAL, AND THAT THEY ARE ENDOWED

02:03:21.994 --> 02:03:23.696
WITH CERTAIN UNALIENABLE RIGHTS,

02:03:23.763 --> 02:03:25.231
AND THAT AMONG THESE ARE LIFE,

02:03:25.297 --> 02:03:27.500
LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF

02:03:27.566 --> 02:03:28.734
HAPPINESS. AS WE REFLECT ON THAT

02:03:28.801 --> 02:03:30.336
BOLD DECLARATION, WE MUST

02:03:30.402 --> 02:03:32.138
REMEMBER THAT IT WAS NOT JUST A

02:03:32.204 --> 02:03:33.372
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE FROM

02:03:33.439 --> 02:03:36.342
A FOREIGN EMPIRE. IT WAS ALSO A

02:03:36.408 --> 02:03:38.277
DECLARATION OF CONVICTION, A

02:03:38.344 --> 02:03:40.179
CONVICTION THAT THE VALUES OF

02:03:40.246 --> 02:03:41.914
DEMOCRACY, EQUALITY, JUSTICE

02:03:41.981 --> 02:03:43.482
COULD BE LIVED OUT IN A LAND

02:03:43.549 --> 02:03:45.384
THAT HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN SUCH

02:03:45.451 --> 02:03:47.419
A VISION. IT WAS A CALL TO BUILD

02:03:47.486 --> 02:03:50.156
A NATION WHERE THE VOICES OF THE

02:03:50.222 --> 02:03:50.689
PEOPLE COULD DETERMINE THE

02:03:50.756 --> 02:03:53.392
COURSE OF THEIR OWN FUTURE. BUT

02:03:53.459 --> 02:03:55.561
COLLEAGUES, AS WE CELEBRATE THIS

02:03:55.628 --> 02:03:56.462
EXTRAORDINARY VISION, WE MUST

02:03:56.529 --> 02:03:57.963
ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THE CHALLENGES

02:03:58.030 --> 02:03:59.431
WE FACE TODAY IN SAFEGUARDING

02:03:59.498 --> 02:04:02.067
AND STRENGTHENING OUR DEMOCRACY.

02:04:02.134 --> 02:04:03.502
FOR WHILE WE MAY HAVE COME A

02:04:03.569 --> 02:04:05.604
LONG WAY SINCE 1776, THE JOURNEY

02:04:05.671 --> 02:04:08.073
IS FAR FROM COMPLETE. IN THE

02:04:08.140 --> 02:04:09.642
PAST FEW YEARS, WE'VE SEEN THE

02:04:09.708 --> 02:04:11.143
VERY FOUNDATIONS OF OUR

02:04:11.210 --> 02:04:13.179
DEMOCRACY TESTED, OUR ELECTORAL

02:04:13.245 --> 02:04:14.680
PROCESSES, OUR INSTITUTIONS, AND

02:04:14.747 --> 02:04:17.216
THE TRUST BETWEEN CITIZENS AND

02:04:17.283 --> 02:04:18.717
GOVERNMENT ARE UNDER SIEGE IN

02:04:18.784 --> 02:04:21.120
WAYS THAT ARE DEEPLY TROUBLING.

02:04:21.187 --> 02:04:22.555
FROM THE SPREAD OF

02:04:22.621 --> 02:04:24.390
MISINFORMATION TO ATTACKS ON THE

02:04:24.456 --> 02:04:26.258
VERY IDEA OF FAIR ELECTIONS TO

02:04:26.325 --> 02:04:28.027
RISING DIVISION AND

02:04:28.093 --> 02:04:29.795
POLARIZATION, WE ARE REMINDED

02:04:29.862 --> 02:04:31.630
THAT DEMOCRACY IS NOT SOMETHING

02:04:31.697 --> 02:04:33.866
THAT IS SIMPLY WON ONCE AND FOR

02:04:33.933 --> 02:04:35.835
ALL. IT IS SOMETHING THAT MUST

02:04:35.901 --> 02:04:37.636
BE ACTIVELY PROTECTED, NURTURED

02:04:37.703 --> 02:04:40.206
AND DEFENDED EVERY DAY. AS WE

02:04:40.272 --> 02:04:41.941
STAND HERE TODAY, WE FACE A

02:04:42.007 --> 02:04:44.243
CHOICE. WE CAN CHOOSE TO GIVE IN

02:04:44.310 --> 02:04:45.377
TO THE FORCES THAT SEEK TO

02:04:45.444 --> 02:04:47.446
DIVIDE US. WE CAN SUCCUMB TO

02:04:47.513 --> 02:04:49.481
CYNICISM AND DESPAIR, BELIEVING

02:04:49.548 --> 02:04:51.383
THAT OUR OWN DIFFERENCES ARE

02:04:51.450 --> 02:04:53.919
JUST SIMPLY TOO GREAT, AND OUR

02:04:53.986 --> 02:04:55.855
CHALLENGES ARE JUST TOO

02:04:55.921 --> 02:04:58.257
OVERWHELMING. OR WE CAN CHOOSE

02:04:58.324 --> 02:05:00.893
TO EMBRACE THE SPIRIT OF JULY

02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:02.761
4TH, NOT JUST AS A CELEBRATION

02:05:02.828 --> 02:05:04.763
OF PAST VICTORIES, BUT AS A CALL

02:05:04.830 --> 02:05:07.566
TO ACTION FOR THE FUTURE. I

02:05:07.633 --> 02:05:08.634
BELIEVE THAT OUR DEMOCRACY IS

02:05:08.701 --> 02:05:10.636
WORTH FIGHTING FOR. I BELIEVE IN

02:05:10.703 --> 02:05:12.638
THE PROMISE THAT WE ARE A NATION

02:05:12.705 --> 02:05:14.406
WHERE EVERY SINGLE VOICE

02:05:14.473 --> 02:05:15.841
MATTERS, WHERE EACH CITIZEN HAS

02:05:15.908 --> 02:05:17.309
THE POWER TO SHAPE THEIR FUTURE,

02:05:17.376 --> 02:05:19.712
AND WHERE JUSTICE IS NOT JUST AN

02:05:19.778 --> 02:05:22.715
IDEAL, BUT IT IS A LIVED REALITY

02:05:22.781 --> 02:05:24.850
FOR ALL. BUT TO HONOR THAT

02:05:24.917 --> 02:05:26.252
PROMISE, WE MUST CONFRONT THE

02:05:26.318 --> 02:05:28.053
REALITIES OF OUR TIME WITH THE

02:05:28.120 --> 02:05:30.556
COURAGE AND WITH RENEWED

02:05:30.623 --> 02:05:32.424
CONVICTION, WE MUST RECOMMIT

02:05:32.491 --> 02:05:34.159
OURSELVES TO THE VALUE OF

02:05:34.226 --> 02:05:35.594
LIBERTY, EQUALITY, AND JUSTICE,

02:05:35.661 --> 02:05:37.329
VALUES THAT HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THE

02:05:37.396 --> 02:05:39.999
GUIDING LIGHT OF THIS NATION.

02:05:40.065 --> 02:05:42.868
EVEN WHEN WE HAVE FALTERED, WE

02:05:42.935 --> 02:05:45.004
MUST REJECT THE FORCES OF HATE,

02:05:45.070 --> 02:05:47.907
FEAR, AND DIVISION, AND INSTEAD

02:05:47.973 --> 02:05:51.877
CHOOSE UNITY OVER THIS KIND OF

02:05:51.944 --> 02:05:53.746
DIVISION. IN THE SPIRIT OF JULY

02:05:53.812 --> 02:05:55.047
4TH, LET US ALSO REMEMBER THAT

02:05:55.114 --> 02:05:56.448
FREEDOM IS NOT SIMPLY THE

02:05:56.515 --> 02:05:58.384
ABSENCE OF TYRANNY. IT IS THE

02:05:58.450 --> 02:06:00.853
ACTIVE PURSUIT OF JUSTICE,

02:06:00.920 --> 02:06:03.289
OPPORTUNITY AND DIGNITY FOR ALL.

02:06:03.355 --> 02:06:05.824
TRUE INDEPENDENCE COMES NOT FROM

02:06:05.891 --> 02:06:07.660
POLITICAL FREEDOM, BUT FROM A

02:06:07.726 --> 02:06:09.895
SOCIETY WHERE ALL PEOPLE,

02:06:09.962 --> 02:06:11.196
REGARDLESS OF THEIR BACKGROUND,

02:06:11.263 --> 02:06:13.132
THEIR BELIEFS, OR THEIR

02:06:13.198 --> 02:06:15.234
CIRCUMSTANCES, HAVE THE CHANCE

02:06:15.301 --> 02:06:16.735
TO THRIVE. THIS DAY IS A

02:06:16.802 --> 02:06:18.804
REMINDER THAT THE WORK OF

02:06:18.871 --> 02:06:19.772
DEMOCRACY IS NEVER FINISHED. IT

02:06:19.838 --> 02:06:21.674
IS UP TO US TO CONTINUE THAT

02:06:21.740 --> 02:06:23.275
WORK, TO SAFEGUARD THE RIGHTS WE

02:06:23.342 --> 02:06:24.610
CHERISH, AND TO ENSURE THAT THE

02:06:24.677 --> 02:06:26.045
PROMISES OF OUR FOUNDING FATHERS

02:06:26.111 --> 02:06:28.047
ARE LIVED OUT IN THE LIVES OF

02:06:28.113 --> 02:06:29.315
EVERY AMERICAN. SO AS WE RAISE

02:06:29.381 --> 02:06:31.617
OUR FLAGS ON JULY 4TH AND

02:06:31.684 --> 02:06:33.252
CELEBRATE THE BEAUTY OF THIS

02:06:33.319 --> 02:06:35.354
NATION, LET US ALSO RENEW OUR

02:06:35.421 --> 02:06:37.256
COMMITMENT TO BUILDING A MORE

02:06:37.323 --> 02:06:39.358
PERFECT UNION. LET US BE

02:06:39.425 --> 02:06:40.626
INSPIRED NOT BY THE HISTORY OF

02:06:40.693 --> 02:06:42.661
OUR PAST, BUT BY THE FUTURE. WE

02:06:42.728 --> 02:06:44.930
HAVE YET TO CREATE AND LET US

02:06:44.997 --> 02:06:47.967
WORK TOGETHER ACROSS THE AISLES,

02:06:48.033 --> 02:06:50.336
ACROSS THE STATE, IN EVERY

02:06:50.402 --> 02:06:51.904
COMMUNITY TO ENSURE THAT THE

02:06:51.971 --> 02:06:53.872
EXPERIENCE OF THE AMERICAN

02:06:53.939 --> 02:06:54.773
EXPERIMENT IS NOT ONLY

02:06:54.840 --> 02:06:56.742
PRESERVED, BUT STRENGTHENED FOR

02:06:56.809 --> 02:06:58.711
GENERATIONS TO COME. AND WITH

02:06:58.777 --> 02:07:00.412
THAT, I'M ASKING ALL OF YOU TO

02:07:00.479 --> 02:07:01.714
SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION SO THAT

02:07:01.780 --> 02:07:03.115
WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO HELP

02:07:03.182 --> 02:07:04.984
REALIZE THE VISION SET FORTH IN

02:07:05.050 --> 02:07:06.986
THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE,

02:07:07.052 --> 02:07:09.154
THE ANNIVERSARY WE CELEBRATE ON

02:07:09.221 --> 02:07:12.224
THE FOURTH. THANK YOU. THANK

02:07:12.291 --> 02:07:15.494
YOU, ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATEL.

02:07:15.561 --> 02:07:16.895
MEMBERS, WE FIND OURSELVES IN A

02:07:16.962 --> 02:07:18.330
UNIQUE SITUATION WHERE WE ARE

02:07:18.397 --> 02:07:19.898
WAITING FOR OUR COLLEAGUES IN

02:07:19.965 --> 02:07:21.467
THE SENATE, AND IT MAY TAKE A

02:07:21.533 --> 02:07:23.702
BIT OF TIME. ARE THERE ANY

02:07:23.769 --> 02:07:25.571
MEMBERS WHO WISH TO SPEAK ON

02:07:25.637 --> 02:07:28.841
THIS HOUSE RESOLUTION ON 4TH OF

02:07:28.907 --> 02:07:32.244
JULY, ASSEMBLY MEMBER BRIAN, YOU

02:07:32.311 --> 02:07:35.848
ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MR.

02:07:35.914 --> 02:07:37.316
SPEAKER. AND COLLEAGUES, I CAN

02:07:37.383 --> 02:07:39.585
HONESTLY SAY THAT I REALLY DID

02:07:39.651 --> 02:07:40.853
NOT PLAN TO SPEAK ON THIS

02:07:40.919 --> 02:07:43.222
RESOLUTION AND WAS PREPARED TO

02:07:43.288 --> 02:07:44.923
VOTE. BUT AS MY COLLEAGUES FROM

02:07:44.990 --> 02:07:47.793
SAN DIEGO WAS SPEAKING, I WAS

02:07:47.860 --> 02:07:49.595
THINKING. I WAS THINKING ABOUT

02:07:49.661 --> 02:07:50.496
THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE

02:07:50.562 --> 02:07:52.831
AND WHAT IT MEANS TO BE AN

02:07:52.898 --> 02:07:54.900
AMERICAN. I WAS THINKING ABOUT

02:07:54.967 --> 02:07:56.468
THE AMERICANS WHO HAVE BEEN

02:07:56.535 --> 02:07:59.038
UNJUSTLY DETAINED BY IMMIGRATION

02:07:59.104 --> 02:07:59.905
ENFORCEMENT AND THE NATIONAL

02:07:59.972 --> 02:08:01.774
GUARD PATROLLING LOS ANGELES. I

02:08:01.840 --> 02:08:03.542
THINK ABOUT WHAT THE DECLARATION

02:08:03.609 --> 02:08:05.978
OF INDEPENDENCE MEANS TO AN

02:08:06.045 --> 02:08:07.579
IMMIGRANT TODAY, KNOWING THAT

02:08:07.646 --> 02:08:09.348
OUR FOUNDING FATHERS WERE ALL

02:08:09.415 --> 02:08:11.183
IMMIGRANTS, AND I WAS THINKING

02:08:11.250 --> 02:08:12.985
ABOUT SOMETHING I SHARE EVERY

02:08:13.052 --> 02:08:14.920
4TH OF JULY. AND THAT IS WHAT TO

02:08:14.987 --> 02:08:17.956
THE SLAVE IS THE 4TH OF JULY, A

02:08:18.023 --> 02:08:19.425
SPEECH GIVEN BY FREDERICK

02:08:19.491 --> 02:08:22.661
DOUGLASS, WHO SPOKE VERY

02:08:22.728 --> 02:08:25.164
STRONGLY ABOUT THE HYPOCRISY OF

02:08:25.230 --> 02:08:27.433
AMERICA CELEBRATING ITS

02:08:27.499 --> 02:08:29.201
INDEPENDENCE WHILE SO MANY WERE

02:08:29.268 --> 02:08:31.270
STILL ENSLAVED. THE HYPOCRISY OF

02:08:31.336 --> 02:08:33.138
OUR FOUNDING FATHERS TO TALK

02:08:33.205 --> 02:08:36.108
ABOUT THE IDEALS OF FREEDOM AND

02:08:36.175 --> 02:08:37.876
LIBERTY AND JUSTICE, WHILE

02:08:37.943 --> 02:08:40.212
OWNING AND PARTICIPATING IN

02:08:40.279 --> 02:08:42.448
SLAVERY. IF I'M QUOTING

02:08:42.514 --> 02:08:43.949
FREDERICK DOUGLASS TODAY, HE

02:08:44.016 --> 02:08:46.285
SAID, I SAY IT WITH A SAD SENSE

02:08:46.351 --> 02:08:47.853
OF DISPARITY BETWEEN US. I AM

02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:48.787
NOT INCLUDED WITHIN THE PALE OF

02:08:48.854 --> 02:08:50.789
YOUR GLORIOUS ANNIVERSARY. YOUR

02:08:50.856 --> 02:08:53.325
HIGH INDEPENDENCE ONLY REVEALS

02:08:53.392 --> 02:08:55.327
THE IMMEASURABLE DISTANCE

02:08:55.394 --> 02:08:57.963
BETWEEN US. THINKING ABOUT HIM

02:08:58.030 --> 02:08:59.765
SAYING THAT, AND KNOWING WHAT

02:08:59.832 --> 02:09:00.566
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS DOING

02:09:00.632 --> 02:09:02.201
AT THIS EXACT MOMENT, CREATING

02:09:02.267 --> 02:09:04.503
GREATER DISTANCE BETWEEN US

02:09:04.570 --> 02:09:05.838
FOLKS WHO HAVE HEALTH CARE,

02:09:05.904 --> 02:09:08.907
FOLKS WHO DO NOT, FOLKS WHO GET

02:09:08.974 --> 02:09:11.577
TAX BREAKS, FOLKS WHO DO NOT,

02:09:11.643 --> 02:09:13.445
FOLKS WHO HAVE PLENTY OF FOOD TO

02:09:13.512 --> 02:09:15.614
EAT, FOLKS WHO DO NOT, THOSE

02:09:15.681 --> 02:09:17.416
WHOSE HUMANITY AND RIGHT TO

02:09:17.483 --> 02:09:19.184
EXIST IN THIS COUNTRY IS

02:09:19.251 --> 02:09:20.986
PROTECTED AND DEFENDED, AND

02:09:21.053 --> 02:09:23.222
THOSE WHO IT IS NOT. SO AS WE

02:09:23.288 --> 02:09:25.657
CELEBRATE THIS 4TH OF JULY, LIKE

02:09:25.724 --> 02:09:26.792
MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED SO

02:09:26.859 --> 02:09:27.860
ELOQUENTLY, I HOPE THAT IT'S A

02:09:27.926 --> 02:09:30.295
MOMENT FOR THAT REFLECTION. BUT

02:09:30.362 --> 02:09:33.098
EVEN MORE SO, A CALL TO ACTION

02:09:33.165 --> 02:09:33.899
TO FULFILL THOSE IDEALS THAT OUR

02:09:33.966 --> 02:09:35.601
FOUNDING FATHERS TALKED ABOUT

02:09:35.667 --> 02:09:36.969
AND TRULY BUILD AN AMERICA

02:09:37.035 --> 02:09:39.404
THAT'S INCLUSIVE OF ALL OF US. I

02:09:39.471 --> 02:09:41.240
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE.

02:09:41.306 --> 02:09:42.574
THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:09:42.641 --> 02:09:44.309
BRIAN, ASSEMBLY MEMBER JEFF

02:09:44.376 --> 02:09:47.546
GONZALEZ, YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

02:09:47.613 --> 02:09:50.549
THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. I FELT

02:09:50.616 --> 02:09:59.158
COMPELLED TO ALSO RISE. OVER 30

02:09:59.224 --> 02:10:01.460
YEARS AGO, I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY

02:10:01.527 --> 02:10:05.597
TO STEP UPON YELLOW FOOTPRINTS.

02:10:05.664 --> 02:10:08.567
THOSE YELLOW FOOTPRINTS ARE ONES

02:10:08.634 --> 02:10:12.237
THAT MARINES STAND BEFORE GOING

02:10:12.304 --> 02:10:16.875
INTO BOOT CAMP. IT LOOKS LIKE A

02:10:16.942 --> 02:10:18.510
CHOICE WHEN WE TAKE ON THE WHEN

02:10:18.577 --> 02:10:21.113
WE STEP ON THOSE FOOTPRINTS. AND

02:10:21.180 --> 02:10:24.616
YES, IT IS A CHOICE, BUT IT WAS

02:10:24.683 --> 02:10:27.152
A DAILY DECISION THAT WE HAD TO

02:10:27.219 --> 02:10:31.990
MAKE EVERY SINGLE DAY TO BE ABLE

02:10:32.057 --> 02:10:32.824
TO STAND AND RISE FOR THE ONE

02:10:32.891 --> 02:10:35.894
NEXT TO US. SEE, IN THE

02:10:35.961 --> 02:10:38.797
MILITARY, I DIDN'T SEE RACISM IN

02:10:38.864 --> 02:10:43.168
OVER 20 YEARS, NOT ONCE. WHETHER

02:10:43.235 --> 02:10:46.238
YOU WERE FROM KENTUCKY OR

02:10:46.305 --> 02:10:49.675
COACHELLA, FROM LOS ANGELES OR

02:10:49.741 --> 02:10:53.779
FROM NEW YORK CITY. WE ALL STOOD

02:10:53.845 --> 02:10:56.782
THERE AND REPRESENTED EACH

02:10:56.848 --> 02:11:01.787
OTHER. DIDN'T MATTER IF YOU LIKE

02:11:01.853 --> 02:11:03.989
SOMEONE, DIDN'T LIKE SOMEONE,

02:11:04.056 --> 02:11:06.892
THAT THOSE THINGS DIDN'T MATTER

02:11:06.959 --> 02:11:10.495
TO US. WHAT MATTERED TO US WAS

02:11:10.562 --> 02:11:16.868
THAT PEOPLE BEFORE US SACRIFICED

02:11:16.935 --> 02:11:20.572
IN ORDER TO FORM A MORE PERFECT

02:11:20.639 --> 02:11:23.875
UNION. PEOPLE BEFORE US DIED FOR

02:11:23.942 --> 02:11:28.814
OUR FREEDOMS. THIS NATION IS FAR

02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:31.316
FROM PERFECT. THIS STATE IS FAR

02:11:31.383 --> 02:11:33.885
FROM PERFECT. BUT I WOULD

02:11:33.952 --> 02:11:36.355
VENTURE TO SAY THAT WE COME HERE

02:11:36.421 --> 02:11:37.923
TODAY, NOT ON THESE YELLOW

02:11:37.990 --> 02:11:39.191
FOOTPRINTS, BUT ON THIS GREEN

02:11:39.258 --> 02:11:43.028
CARPET, TO MAKE A CHOICE, TO

02:11:43.095 --> 02:11:44.663
MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES BETTER, TO

02:11:44.730 --> 02:11:46.698
MAKE A CHOICE TO MAKE OUR

02:11:46.765 --> 02:11:50.068
COUNTRY BETTER. AND YES, THINGS

02:11:50.135 --> 02:11:54.273
DIVIDE US. AND YES, WE MAY HAVE

02:11:54.339 --> 02:11:56.608
DIFFERENCES OF OPINION, BUT IN

02:11:56.675 --> 02:11:59.778
THE END, I CAN SAY THAT WE ARE

02:11:59.845 --> 02:12:02.714
ALL UNITED FOR ONE CAUSE. AND

02:12:02.781 --> 02:12:05.384
THAT CAUSE IS THE CAUSE OF

02:12:05.450 --> 02:12:07.352
FREEDOM IN OUR COMMUNITY. THAT

02:12:07.419 --> 02:12:09.421
CAUSE IS FOR GOODNESS IN OUR

02:12:09.488 --> 02:12:11.723
COMMUNITY, AND THAT CAUSE IS

02:12:11.790 --> 02:12:14.226
WORTH FIGHTING FOR ON THESE

02:12:14.293 --> 02:12:16.762
GREEN, ON THIS GREEN CARPET, ON

02:12:16.828 --> 02:12:20.599
THOSE YELLOW FOOTPRINTS, ON THE

02:12:20.666 --> 02:12:24.503
STREETS OF A SMALL TOWN AND

02:12:24.569 --> 02:12:27.439
ACROSS THE WORLD. BECAUSE

02:12:27.506 --> 02:12:28.874
INHERENTLY WE HAVE SOMETHING

02:12:28.940 --> 02:12:31.109
GOOD INSIDE OF EACH AND EVERY

02:12:31.176 --> 02:12:33.945
ONE OF US, AND THAT IS WORTH

02:12:34.012 --> 02:12:36.615
FIGHTING FOR. AND THAT IS THE

02:12:36.682 --> 02:12:40.719
FREEDOM THAT I FIGHT FOR. THANK

02:12:40.786 --> 02:12:42.621
YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ,

02:12:42.688 --> 02:12:45.524
ASSEMBLY MEMBER SCHULTZ, YOU ARE

02:12:45.590 --> 02:12:48.760
RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH,

02:12:48.827 --> 02:12:50.228
MR. SPEAKER. AS LUCK WOULD HAVE

02:12:50.295 --> 02:12:51.663
IT, I FELT ALMOST CALLED UPON TO

02:12:51.730 --> 02:12:54.132
SPEAK TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS

02:12:54.199 --> 02:12:56.068
MEASURE. BUT WHAT I WOULD SIMPLY

02:12:56.134 --> 02:12:57.436
SUBMIT, MR. SPEAKER, IS THAT I

02:12:57.502 --> 02:12:59.137
WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM

02:12:59.204 --> 02:13:00.639
SAN DIEGO FOR BRINGING FORWARD

02:13:00.706 --> 02:13:02.841
THE MEASURE. I WANT TO THANK THE

02:13:02.908 --> 02:13:03.475
COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES FROM

02:13:03.542 --> 02:13:04.943
BOTH LOS ANGELES AND COACHELLA

02:13:05.010 --> 02:13:06.645
VALLEY. I THINK IT IS MORE

02:13:06.712 --> 02:13:08.213
IMPORTANT THAN EVER THAT IN THIS

02:13:08.280 --> 02:13:09.681
DAY AND AGE, IF WE'RE TRULY

02:13:09.748 --> 02:13:11.683
GOING TO HONOR THE WORK OF OUR

02:13:11.750 --> 02:13:12.617
FOUNDERS, WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND

02:13:12.684 --> 02:13:13.719
THAT THEY WEREN'T JUST FIGHTING

02:13:13.785 --> 02:13:15.454
FOR A PARCHMENT OF PAPER. THEY

02:13:15.520 --> 02:13:16.588
WEREN'T JUST FIGHTING FOR A

02:13:16.655 --> 02:13:18.423
PIECE OF CLOTH AS IMPORTANT AS A

02:13:18.490 --> 02:13:20.492
SYMBOL AS IT IS, THEY WERE

02:13:20.559 --> 02:13:21.193
FIGHTING FOR DEMOCRACY ITSELF.

02:13:21.259 --> 02:13:23.362
THE VERY BELIEF THAT WE CAN

02:13:23.428 --> 02:13:25.530
DETERMINE OUR OWN RULE OF LAW,

02:13:25.597 --> 02:13:26.531
THAT WE CAN SELECT OUR OWN

02:13:26.598 --> 02:13:28.400
LEADERS. AND IT'S A IT'S AN IDEA

02:13:28.467 --> 02:13:30.135
THAT IS FOUNDED ON THE PREMISE

02:13:30.202 --> 02:13:32.170
THAT WE SHOULDN'T DEMONIZE AND

02:13:32.237 --> 02:13:33.772
VILLAINIZE ONE ANOTHER AND TEAR

02:13:33.839 --> 02:13:34.573
EACH OTHER APART. DEBATE IS

02:13:34.639 --> 02:13:36.308
GOOD. DISAGREEMENT IS GOOD. A

02:13:36.375 --> 02:13:38.810
HEALTHY EXCHANGE OF IDEAS IS

02:13:38.877 --> 02:13:40.946
GOOD. AND SO I RISE. AND I THANK

02:13:41.012 --> 02:13:42.347
AGAIN THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING

02:13:42.414 --> 02:13:44.416
FORWARD THE MEASURE. AND I HOPE

02:13:44.483 --> 02:13:45.584
THAT ESPECIALLY THIS HOLIDAY

02:13:45.650 --> 02:13:47.419
THIS YEAR, WITH EVERYTHING GOING

02:13:47.486 --> 02:13:50.122
ON IN THE WORLD, WE CAN FIND A

02:13:50.188 --> 02:13:51.089
WAY TO GET BACK TO CENTER AND

02:13:51.156 --> 02:13:52.424
REMIND EACH OTHER THAT WE ARE

02:13:52.491 --> 02:13:55.293
NOT EACH OTHER'S ENEMY. WE ARE

02:13:55.360 --> 02:13:56.495
FUNDAMENTALLY ON THE SAME TEAM.

02:13:56.561 --> 02:13:58.163
WE HAVE STRONG DIFFERENCES OF

02:13:58.230 --> 02:13:59.564
OPINION ABOUT WHAT OUR

02:13:59.631 --> 02:14:00.665
PRIORITIES SHOULD BE AND HOW

02:14:00.732 --> 02:14:02.567
BEST TO ACCOMPLISH THEM. BUT AT

02:14:02.634 --> 02:14:04.436
THE END OF THE DAY, WE ARE ALL

02:14:04.503 --> 02:14:06.138
AMERICANS. WE ALL CALL THIS

02:14:06.204 --> 02:14:07.239
COUNTRY HOME, AND WE HAVE A

02:14:07.305 --> 02:14:08.673
SOLEMN DUTY TO PROTECT EVERYONE

02:14:08.740 --> 02:14:10.475
WHO SEEKS THE SHELTER OF OUR

02:14:10.542 --> 02:14:13.879
SHORES. THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER.

02:14:13.945 --> 02:14:14.713
THANK YOU, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:14:14.780 --> 02:14:18.717
SCHULTZ. ASSEMBLY MEMBER TONGUE.

02:14:18.784 --> 02:14:22.053
NO, I'M JUST KIDDING. ASSEMBLY

02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:23.789
MEMBER BARBADIAN, YOU ARE

02:14:23.855 --> 02:14:25.223
RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MR.

02:14:25.290 --> 02:14:26.658
SPEAKER. AND JUST TO FOLLOW UP

02:14:26.725 --> 02:14:28.560
ON SOMETHING TO DEBATE, YOU

02:14:28.627 --> 02:14:30.929
KNOW, I GREW UP IN A CITY OF

02:14:30.996 --> 02:14:32.297
SYRIA CALLED SIERRA MADRE. AND

02:14:32.364 --> 02:14:36.001
ONE OF MY FIRST MEMORIES WAS WAS

02:14:36.067 --> 02:14:37.636
THE 4TH OF JULY PARADE. MANY OF

02:14:37.702 --> 02:14:40.005
US WILL BE IN PARADES THIS

02:14:40.071 --> 02:14:41.072
WEEKEND. AND I'LL TELL YOU ONE

02:14:41.139 --> 02:14:43.575
THING THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT NOW

02:14:43.642 --> 02:14:45.644
THAN IT WAS WHEN I WAS A KID.

02:14:45.710 --> 02:14:47.412
AND EVEN WHEN I WAS A COUNCIL

02:14:47.479 --> 02:14:48.747
MEMBER IN SIERRA MADRE. AND

02:14:48.814 --> 02:14:49.915
AGAIN, THE HIGHLIGHT EVERY YEAR

02:14:49.981 --> 02:14:51.950
OF BEING A COUNCIL MEMBER THERE

02:14:52.017 --> 02:14:53.452
IS YOU GET TO RIDE IN A PARADE.

02:14:53.518 --> 02:14:55.487
ONE THING THAT'S DIFFERENT IS WE

02:14:55.554 --> 02:14:56.755
NO LONGER HAVE HOSE FIGHTS.

02:14:56.822 --> 02:14:57.589
THERE'S NO LONGER PEOPLE

02:14:57.656 --> 02:14:59.825
SPRAYING HOSES AT EACH OTHER.

02:14:59.891 --> 02:15:02.627
WHEN WE'RE RIDING DOWN THE

02:15:02.694 --> 02:15:04.229
BOULEVARD. AND SO LET'S DEBATE

02:15:04.296 --> 02:15:05.597
SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT AND

02:15:05.664 --> 02:15:06.798
MAYBE LIGHTEN THE MOOD. SHOULD

02:15:06.865 --> 02:15:09.935
WE STILL HAVE WATER HOSES BEING

02:15:10.001 --> 02:15:11.336
SPRAYED AT PEOPLE WHEN THEY'RE

02:15:11.403 --> 02:15:13.038
RIDING DOWN A 4TH OF JULY

02:15:13.104 --> 02:15:16.341
PARADE? PARADE ON A HOT DAY? I,

02:15:16.408 --> 02:15:18.844
FOR ONE, COLLEAGUES, WOULD ARGUE

02:15:18.910 --> 02:15:21.746
THAT THAT IS A 4TH OF JULY

02:15:21.813 --> 02:15:22.447
PARADE. WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO

02:15:22.514 --> 02:15:24.583
SPRAY HOSES AT EACH OTHER. SUPER

02:15:24.649 --> 02:15:25.951
SOAKERS. THOSE WERE WATER

02:15:26.017 --> 02:15:28.019
PISTOLS THAT I GREW UP WITH WERE

02:15:28.086 --> 02:15:30.088
WERE PREVALENT EVERYWHERE. AND

02:15:30.155 --> 02:15:31.590
I'LL TELL YOU NOW, FOR SOME

02:15:31.656 --> 02:15:33.959
REASON, IN CITIES ACROSS

02:15:34.025 --> 02:15:34.993
CALIFORNIA, YOU NO LONGER CAN

02:15:35.060 --> 02:15:38.363
SPRAY WATER AT EACH OTHER. AND

02:15:38.430 --> 02:15:40.866
FOR MY PERSPECTIVE, THIS IS YET

02:15:40.932 --> 02:15:42.234
ONE MEMBER ON THIS FLOOR THAT'S

02:15:42.300 --> 02:15:45.103
UN-AMERICAN. AND SO I THINK

02:15:45.170 --> 02:15:47.005
SOMETHING THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT

02:15:47.072 --> 02:15:49.741
IS BRINGING WATER BACK TO 4TH OF

02:15:49.808 --> 02:15:51.576
JULY PARADES AND 4TH OF JULY

02:15:51.643 --> 02:15:53.478
PARADE ROUTES. SO THANK YOU, MR.

02:15:53.545 --> 02:15:55.013
SPEAKER, FOR ALLOWING ME TO

02:15:55.080 --> 02:15:56.348
WEIGH IN ON THIS IMPORTANT

02:15:56.414 --> 02:15:58.984
DEBATE. THANK YOU. IT'S QUITE A

02:15:59.050 --> 02:16:03.588
HISTORIC TALK POINTS. MR.

02:16:03.655 --> 02:16:04.990
ASSEMBLY MEMBER, YOU ARE

02:16:05.056 --> 02:16:08.126
RECOGNIZED. ALL RIGHT. SINCE I

02:16:08.193 --> 02:16:09.294
KNOW YOU'VE ALL BEEN WAITING TO

02:16:09.361 --> 02:16:12.430
HEAR FROM ME, I TOO JUST WANT TO

02:16:12.497 --> 02:16:14.132
MAKE SURE THAT I'M THANKING THE

02:16:14.199 --> 02:16:14.766
MEMBER FROM SAN DIEGO FOR

02:16:14.833 --> 02:16:19.304
BRINGING THIS RESOLUTION. I. AM

02:16:19.371 --> 02:16:21.873
BLESSED, AND I THINK THAT ALL OF

02:16:21.940 --> 02:16:24.843
US ARE TRULY BLESSED. AND TO BE

02:16:24.910 --> 02:16:26.845
HERE TODAY IS JUST SOMETHING

02:16:26.912 --> 02:16:28.780
THAT'S SO AMAZING. I THINK ABOUT

02:16:28.847 --> 02:16:31.216
A LOT. WHEN MY MOTHER IMMIGRATED

02:16:31.283 --> 02:16:32.817
TO THIS COUNTRY AND WHILE WE

02:16:32.884 --> 02:16:36.154
WERE YOUNGER, AND I THINK I'VE

02:16:36.221 --> 02:16:37.589
SHARED THIS PHRASE BEFORE TO WE

02:16:37.656 --> 02:16:39.624
USED TO WAIT IN THE FOOD LINES

02:16:39.691 --> 02:16:41.593
AT THE CHURCH, MULTIPLE OF THEM

02:16:41.660 --> 02:16:43.295
ALL ACROSS, NOT TOO FAR FROM

02:16:43.361 --> 02:16:44.829
HERE, ACTUALLY. AND WHILE WE

02:16:44.896 --> 02:16:46.698
WERE THERE IN TONGAN, SHE WOULD

02:16:46.765 --> 02:16:49.534
ALWAYS SAY TO US THAT YOU MAY BE

02:16:49.601 --> 02:16:52.003
THE POOREST AMERICANS, BUT

02:16:52.070 --> 02:16:53.438
YOU'RE THE RICHEST TONGANS

02:16:53.505 --> 02:16:55.607
BECAUSE YOU'RE IN AMERICA, AND

02:16:55.674 --> 02:16:57.008
THERE'S NOWHERE IN THE COUNTRY

02:16:57.075 --> 02:17:00.278
OF TONGA THAT YOU CAN GO TO A

02:17:00.345 --> 02:17:01.947
CORNER AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU A

02:17:02.013 --> 02:17:04.282
BOX OF FOOD. THERE'S NO CHURCH

02:17:04.349 --> 02:17:06.384
THAT'S GOING TO SPONSOR YOU AND

02:17:06.451 --> 02:17:09.688
GIVE YOU GAMEBOYS AND BATTERIES,

02:17:09.754 --> 02:17:11.456
AND YOU CARE ABOUT WHETHER YOU

02:17:11.523 --> 02:17:13.258
HAVE HOLES IN YOUR SHOES AND

02:17:13.325 --> 02:17:16.127
YOUR COUSINS DON'T HAVE SHOES.

02:17:16.194 --> 02:17:18.363
BUT SHE CAME HERE FOR A BETTER

02:17:18.430 --> 02:17:20.131
OPPORTUNITY AND AN AMAZING LIFE.

02:17:20.198 --> 02:17:21.499
AND JUST TWO YEARS AGO, I WAS

02:17:21.566 --> 02:17:23.568
ABLE TO GIVE MY MOTHER HER LEGAL

02:17:23.635 --> 02:17:26.304
RESIDENCY PAPERWORK. AND ONE OF

02:17:26.371 --> 02:17:27.973
THE THINGS THAT STANDS WITH ME

02:17:28.039 --> 02:17:30.508
MOST IS AT THE END. AFTER

02:17:30.575 --> 02:17:33.778
RECEIVING THAT ON CHRISTMAS, HER

02:17:33.845 --> 02:17:37.182
LAST WORDS WERE, NOW I'M AN

02:17:37.248 --> 02:17:39.618
AMERICAN. AND NOW THAT SHE GETS

02:17:39.684 --> 02:17:41.720
TO WAKE UP EVERY DAY AND TO SEE

02:17:41.786 --> 02:17:44.422
THAT HER SON IS IN THE STATE

02:17:44.489 --> 02:17:46.625
CAPITOL AFTER SHE GREW UP ON AN

02:17:46.691 --> 02:17:48.360
ISLAND WITH NO ELECTRICITY. I

02:17:48.426 --> 02:17:51.730
NEVER SEEN STAIRS BEFORE. THAT

02:17:51.796 --> 02:17:54.265
IS EXACTLY WHAT THE FOUNDING

02:17:54.332 --> 02:17:57.469
FATHERS WERE AIMING FOR. I AM MY

02:17:57.535 --> 02:17:59.237
MOTHER'S AMERICAN DREAM AND I

02:17:59.304 --> 02:18:02.941
FIGHT FOR THAT. THIS SOCIETY IS

02:18:03.008 --> 02:18:05.944
ONE THAT IS BEAUTIFUL, ONE THAT

02:18:06.011 --> 02:18:07.579
WE ALL GET TO CHERISH, AND ONE

02:18:07.646 --> 02:18:09.347
THAT I GET TO SHARE WITH ALL OF

02:18:09.414 --> 02:18:13.318
YOU AS WE SEE KIDS ON THE FLOOR.

02:18:13.385 --> 02:18:16.421
SO AMAZING. I TRULY THINK

02:18:16.488 --> 02:18:18.189
SERVING WITH ALL OF YOU. AND IF

02:18:18.256 --> 02:18:19.758
THE FOUNDING FATHERS WERE HERE

02:18:19.824 --> 02:18:21.993
TODAY, LOOKING OUT AT THIS ROOM,

02:18:22.060 --> 02:18:23.595
WOULD BE DAMN PROUD TO SEE WHAT

02:18:23.662 --> 02:18:25.864
A MORE PERFECT UNION LOOKS LIKE

02:18:25.930 --> 02:18:27.265
AND WHAT THE PURSUIT OF

02:18:27.332 --> 02:18:28.500
HAPPINESS LOOKS LIKE. AND IT'S

02:18:28.566 --> 02:18:30.935
AN HONOR TO SERVE WITH YOU ALL.

02:18:31.002 --> 02:18:32.504
THANK YOU. AND I ASK FOR AN EYE

02:18:32.570 --> 02:18:34.739
ON THIS. WELL SAID, MR. ASSEMBLY

02:18:34.806 --> 02:18:35.974
MEMBER HARDWICK, YOU ARE

02:18:36.041 --> 02:18:38.543
RECOGNIZED IN THE SPIRIT OF

02:18:38.610 --> 02:18:40.445
VOLUNTOLD STORYTELLING. I RISE

02:18:40.512 --> 02:18:43.515
IN STRONG SUPPORT OF H.R. 47.

02:18:43.581 --> 02:18:45.450
4TH OF JULY IS A RITE OF PASSAGE

02:18:45.517 --> 02:18:47.218
IN MY COMMUNITY IN MODOC COUNTY.

02:18:47.285 --> 02:18:49.821
WE CALL IT FANDANGO DAYS BECAUSE

02:18:49.888 --> 02:18:52.223
OF FANDANGO PASS THAT WAS NAMED

02:18:52.290 --> 02:18:53.992
THE MOUNTAIN. THE PASS THAT THEY

02:18:54.059 --> 02:18:55.460
GO OVER IN THE APPLEGATE TRAIL

02:18:55.527 --> 02:18:59.064
IS 6100FT IN ELEVATION. AND WHEN

02:18:59.130 --> 02:19:01.566
THEY CAME TO IT, THEY SAW A BIG

02:19:01.633 --> 02:19:03.435
LAKE AND FOG AND THOUGHT THEY

02:19:03.501 --> 02:19:04.769
HAD HIT THE COAST. SO THEY

02:19:04.836 --> 02:19:06.237
THOUGHT THEY WERE DONE AND THEY

02:19:06.304 --> 02:19:08.173
WERE HOME. SO THEY DID A LITTLE

02:19:08.239 --> 02:19:09.808
FANDANGO, WHICH IS A LITTLE

02:19:09.874 --> 02:19:11.943
DANCE, AND THEN WOKE UP IN THE

02:19:12.010 --> 02:19:13.511
MORNING AND THEY WERE NOT. THEY

02:19:13.578 --> 02:19:16.081
HAD JUST BARELY MADE IT TO

02:19:16.147 --> 02:19:17.415
OREGON. SO THIS WAS THE LASSEN

02:19:17.482 --> 02:19:20.251
CUTOFF. SO WE HAVE A PARTY AND

02:19:20.318 --> 02:19:22.053
CELEBRATE THAT WE'RE ALMOST

02:19:22.120 --> 02:19:23.922
HOME. AND WE WERE ALMOST DONE.

02:19:23.988 --> 02:19:25.323
AND WE HAVE A PARADE. AND I

02:19:25.390 --> 02:19:26.624
DON'T KNOW, MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE

02:19:26.691 --> 02:19:28.927
WE HAVE ALL THE WATER UP NORTH,

02:19:28.993 --> 02:19:29.961
BUT WE STILL SQUIRT PEOPLE IN

02:19:30.028 --> 02:19:31.496
OUR PARADES. SO COME ON UP ON

02:19:31.563 --> 02:19:33.231
SATURDAY AT 10 A.M. IT'S A

02:19:33.298 --> 02:19:35.633
REALLY GOOD TIME. THANK YOU.

02:19:35.700 --> 02:19:37.902
ASSEMBLY MEMBER HARDWICK,

02:19:37.969 --> 02:19:39.037
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. LACKEY, YOU ARE

02:19:39.104 --> 02:19:42.140
RECOGNIZED. YEAH. JUST REAL

02:19:42.207 --> 02:19:43.775
QUICKLY, I'D LIKE TO INVITE MY

02:19:43.842 --> 02:19:46.444
COLLEAGUE FROM PASADENA TO ACTON

02:19:46.511 --> 02:19:49.481
ON THE 4TH OF JULY. WE STILL

02:19:49.547 --> 02:19:52.250
HAVE AN ENGAGEMENT EVERY YEAR.

02:19:52.317 --> 02:19:54.753
IT'S A REALLY BIG PARADE ON THE

02:19:54.819 --> 02:19:56.554
4TH OF JULY, AND PEOPLE ACTUALLY

02:19:56.621 --> 02:19:58.823
RESERVE A SPOT ALONG THE MAIN

02:19:58.890 --> 02:20:01.593
ROAD THERE DAYS IN ADVANCE. AND

02:20:01.659 --> 02:20:04.629
IT IS A COMPLETE WATER FIGHT.

02:20:04.696 --> 02:20:06.731
AND I WILL BE GETTING VERY WET

02:20:06.798 --> 02:20:08.466
THAT DAY. AND I REALLY LOOK

02:20:08.533 --> 02:20:10.368
FORWARD TO THAT, THAT SIMPLE

02:20:10.435 --> 02:20:12.303
EXCHANGE. BUT IN CLOSING, I JUST

02:20:12.370 --> 02:20:14.239
WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I WAS

02:20:14.305 --> 02:20:16.474
ABLE TO ATTEND THE SPECIAL

02:20:16.541 --> 02:20:18.977
OLYMPICS SUMMER GAMES IN SANTA

02:20:19.043 --> 02:20:21.513
CLARA THIS PAST WEEKEND, AND THE

02:20:21.579 --> 02:20:23.615
REASON WHY I MENTIONED THAT IS

02:20:23.681 --> 02:20:27.552
BECAUSE DURING THOSE COMPETITIVE

02:20:27.619 --> 02:20:31.856
DAYS, I NOTICED AND ONE OF THE

02:20:31.923 --> 02:20:32.657
THINGS THAT'S MOST REFRESHING

02:20:32.724 --> 02:20:35.160
ABOUT THAT COMPETITION IS

02:20:35.226 --> 02:20:37.996
EVERYBODY IS UNITED, EVERYBODY.

02:20:38.062 --> 02:20:43.368
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT.

02:20:43.434 --> 02:20:45.837
POLITICAL AFFILIATION YOU HAVE,

02:20:45.904 --> 02:20:48.373
WHAT COUNTRY YOU'RE FROM, WHAT

02:20:48.439 --> 02:20:51.309
RELIGION YOU ESPOUSE. NONE OF IT

02:20:51.376 --> 02:20:53.077
MATTERS, NONE OF IT. AND

02:20:53.144 --> 02:20:55.947
EVERYBODY IS UNITED AND CHEERING

02:20:56.014 --> 02:20:57.782
FOR GOODNESS. AND I'M TELLING

02:20:57.849 --> 02:20:59.717
YOU, IT REALLY WARMS MY HEART

02:20:59.784 --> 02:21:01.486
THAT WE HAVE THAT KIND OF

02:21:01.553 --> 02:21:02.887
INFLUENCE IN THIS COUNTRY

02:21:02.954 --> 02:21:04.722
BECAUSE WE HAVE TOO MANY OTHER

02:21:04.789 --> 02:21:06.090
INFLUENCERS WHO ARE TRYING TO

02:21:06.157 --> 02:21:09.427
DIVIDE US. AND ONE OF THE THINGS

02:21:09.494 --> 02:21:12.697
I LOVE ABOUT AMERICA, I'M NOT

02:21:12.764 --> 02:21:14.365
SHORT ON OPINIONS. NONE OF US

02:21:14.432 --> 02:21:15.733
ARE THAT ARE IN HERE. WE

02:21:15.800 --> 02:21:17.635
WOULDN'T BE HERE OR SHOULDN'T BE

02:21:17.702 --> 02:21:19.003
HERE, BUT THE WAY WE ENGAGE IS

02:21:19.070 --> 02:21:21.105
REALLY IMPORTANT, AND I HOPE

02:21:21.172 --> 02:21:22.774
THAT WE'LL CONTINUE TO

02:21:22.841 --> 02:21:24.509
UNDERSTAND THAT WE ALL LOVE THIS

02:21:24.576 --> 02:21:27.445
COUNTRY. WE ALL WANT TO MAKE IT

02:21:27.512 --> 02:21:29.581
AS GOOD AS WE CAN. AND THAT

02:21:29.647 --> 02:21:31.482
WHOLE LET US ADOPT THE SPIRIT OF

02:21:31.549 --> 02:21:33.218
THE SPECIAL OLYMPICS AND FOCUS

02:21:33.284 --> 02:21:35.453
ON WHAT UNITES US INSTEAD OF

02:21:35.520 --> 02:21:37.856
WHAT DIVIDES US. THANK YOU.

02:21:37.922 --> 02:21:38.823
THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER,

02:21:38.890 --> 02:21:40.758

MR. SPEAKER. I RISE IN THE

02:21:45.864 --> 02:21:48.233
SPIRIT OF EQUALITY, OF HAVING

02:21:48.299 --> 02:21:51.169
HEARING SO MANY OF OUR GENTLEMEN

02:21:51.236 --> 02:21:53.605
COLLEAGUES VOICES. SINCE YOU'VE

02:21:53.671 --> 02:21:55.406
GIVEN US THIS OPPORTUNITY, I

02:21:55.473 --> 02:21:57.342
REALLY WANTED TO SUPPORT THE

02:21:57.408 --> 02:21:59.010
ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM SAN DIEGO

02:21:59.077 --> 02:22:00.812
FOR THE SERIOUSNESS TO WHICH SHE

02:22:00.879 --> 02:22:03.514
BROUGHT TO THIS RESOLUTION,

02:22:03.581 --> 02:22:05.516
WHICH, AS WE ARE CELEBRATING

02:22:05.583 --> 02:22:06.885
INDEPENDENCE DAY, WE HAVE AN

02:22:06.951 --> 02:22:08.386
OPPORTUNITY TO REFLECT. THESE

02:22:08.453 --> 02:22:10.154
ARE NOT JUST TIMES FOR US TO GET

02:22:10.221 --> 02:22:12.557
TOGETHER AND CELEBRATE BARBECUES

02:22:12.624 --> 02:22:15.226
AND FIREWORKS. AS WE THINK ABOUT

02:22:15.293 --> 02:22:17.028
FREEDOM AND WE THINK ABOUT

02:22:17.095 --> 02:22:17.795
INDEPENDENCE DAY, AND WE THINK

02:22:17.862 --> 02:22:19.697
ABOUT THE TIME THAT WE HAVE

02:22:19.764 --> 02:22:20.698
HERE, WE HAVE A HUGE

02:22:20.765 --> 02:22:21.366
RESPONSIBILITY TO FIGHT FOR

02:22:21.432 --> 02:22:23.835
THOSE VERY IDEALS THAT THE

02:22:23.902 --> 02:22:26.004
INDEPENDENCE DAY STANDS FOR. IT

02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:28.539
IS THE SACRIFICES THAT OUR

02:22:28.606 --> 02:22:29.707
FOREFATHERS AND THOSE WHO COME

02:22:29.774 --> 02:22:32.176
BEFORE US HAVE MADE IN THIS VERY

02:22:32.243 --> 02:22:34.212
MOMENT IN TIME. WE ARE FIGHTING

02:22:34.279 --> 02:22:35.980
TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE NOT GOING

02:22:36.047 --> 02:22:37.949
BACKWARDS IN TIME, THAT WE ARE

02:22:38.016 --> 02:22:39.851
NOT GIVING AWAY THE HOPE AND THE

02:22:39.918 --> 02:22:41.719
PROMISE AND THE DREAMS THAT WERE

02:22:41.786 --> 02:22:44.756
ATTACHED TO THE SERIOUSNESS, THE

02:22:44.822 --> 02:22:46.557
SERIOUSNESS OF THE CELEBRATION

02:22:46.624 --> 02:22:49.093
FOR OUR INDEPENDENCE. SO I WANT

02:22:49.160 --> 02:22:50.929
TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING

02:22:50.995 --> 02:22:52.964
US SUCH AN IMPORTANT RESOLUTION,

02:22:53.031 --> 02:22:54.899
BECAUSE THIS IS A TIME THAT WE

02:22:54.966 --> 02:22:57.001
ARE, AS A NATION, BEING DIVIDED,

02:22:57.068 --> 02:22:59.170
AND WE KNOW THAT THOSE WHO, IF

02:22:59.237 --> 02:23:00.972
YOU DON'T STAND TOGETHER, YOU

02:23:01.039 --> 02:23:02.840
FALL APART. AND THIS IS AN

02:23:02.907 --> 02:23:03.775
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO COME

02:23:03.841 --> 02:23:05.376

02:23:05.443 --> 02:23:07.845
REASONS AS WE CELEBRATE THIS

02:23:07.912 --> 02:23:10.014

02:24:32.530 --> 02:24:34.298
CAREER TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT. SO

02:24:34.365 --> 02:24:37.035
MY SCHOOL DISTRICT USED TO OWN A

02:24:37.101 --> 02:24:38.669
CLASSIC FIRETRUCK, AND WE WOULD

02:24:38.736 --> 02:24:40.671
SIT ON THAT FIRE TRUCK WITH OUR

02:24:40.738 --> 02:24:43.908
SUPER SOAKERS, AND ONLY UPON

02:24:43.975 --> 02:24:45.676
MAKING ACKNOWLEDGING

02:24:45.743 --> 02:24:47.045
APPRECIATIVE EYE CONTACT WITH

02:24:47.111 --> 02:24:49.347
THOSE CHILDREN SEATED PARADE

02:24:49.414 --> 02:24:51.482
SIDE DID WE CHOOSE TO DISCHARGE

02:24:51.549 --> 02:24:54.385
OUR WATER ONTO THOSE CHILDREN,

02:24:54.452 --> 02:24:56.187
RELIEVING THEM OF AN EXTREME

02:24:56.254 --> 02:24:58.990
AMOUNT OF HEAT AND FATIGUE FROM

02:24:59.057 --> 02:25:00.358
SITTING ON THE SIDELINES WAITING

02:25:00.425 --> 02:25:01.893
FOR THE MARCHING BAND TO COME

02:25:01.959 --> 02:25:04.095
BY? BECAUSE IT WAS INDEED THE

02:25:04.162 --> 02:25:05.129
MARCHING BAND THAT THEY WANTED

02:25:05.196 --> 02:25:06.531
TO HEAR FROM THE VARIOUS HIGH

02:25:06.597 --> 02:25:08.399
SCHOOLS. SO I HOPE THAT

02:25:08.466 --> 02:25:09.767
SATISFIES YOU. I HAVE NEVER USED

02:25:09.834 --> 02:25:13.037
A HOSE THOUGH, ON PARADE

02:25:13.104 --> 02:25:15.506
WATCHER. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

02:25:15.573 --> 02:25:17.308
MEMBER PATEL. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:25:17.375 --> 02:25:19.911
DEMAIO, YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

02:25:19.977 --> 02:25:21.446
THANK YOU. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF

02:25:21.512 --> 02:25:23.981
H.R. 47. WHEN I DID EIGHT YEARS

02:25:24.048 --> 02:25:26.417
ON RADIO, I ALWAYS TOOK JULY 4TH

02:25:26.484 --> 02:25:28.686
OFF. I DID NOT DO A LIVE SHOW,

02:25:28.753 --> 02:25:30.455
BUT I HAD ALWAYS HAD TO DO A

02:25:30.521 --> 02:25:31.756
PRE-RECORD BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

02:25:31.823 --> 02:25:32.557
THE STATION HAS TO PAY THE

02:25:32.623 --> 02:25:34.725
BILLS. SO DID AN ORIGINAL SHOW.

02:25:34.792 --> 02:25:37.261
IT WAS ALWAYS A CIVICS LESSON.

02:25:37.328 --> 02:25:38.496
LESSON. I SAID, YOU KNOW, LOOK,

02:25:38.563 --> 02:25:40.565
YOU KNOW, GATHER THE KIDS

02:25:40.631 --> 02:25:41.566
AROUND. I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN TO

02:25:41.632 --> 02:25:43.134
THEM WHAT THEY'RE NOT LEARNING

02:25:43.201 --> 02:25:45.002
IN THE CLASSROOM ANYMORE. AND

02:25:45.069 --> 02:25:48.239
THAT IS WHY THE DECLARATION OF

02:25:48.306 --> 02:25:50.475
INDEPENDENCE WAS SUCH A SUCH A

02:25:50.541 --> 02:25:53.244
BOLD, EARTH SHATTERING

02:25:53.311 --> 02:25:55.079
DEVELOPMENT IN HUMAN HISTORY.

02:25:55.146 --> 02:25:58.850
AND TO SUMMARIZE IT WELL, SINCE

02:25:58.916 --> 02:26:00.618
WE'RE WINNING ON THE SENATE,

02:26:00.685 --> 02:26:01.652
MAYBE I CAN GET UNANIMOUS

02:26:01.719 --> 02:26:04.155
CONSENT TO GET A COUPLE EXTRA

02:26:04.222 --> 02:26:05.923
MINUTES. BUT TO SUMMARIZE IT,

02:26:05.990 --> 02:26:09.260
OUR KIDS ARE NOT TAUGHT JUST HOW

02:26:09.327 --> 02:26:10.962
GUTSY THIS RESOLUTION WAS. AND

02:26:11.028 --> 02:26:12.763
I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT, YOU

02:26:12.830 --> 02:26:14.265
KNOW, THE OPEN REBELLION AGAINST

02:26:14.332 --> 02:26:17.568
A KING. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE

02:26:17.635 --> 02:26:18.503
PHILOSOPHICAL EARTHQUAKE THAT

02:26:18.569 --> 02:26:19.937
HAPPENED WITH THIS DOCUMENT

02:26:20.004 --> 02:26:21.939
WHERE THEY SAID, WE'RE NOT THE

02:26:22.006 --> 02:26:22.974
MAGNA CARTA, WE'RE NOT GOING TO

02:26:23.040 --> 02:26:25.143
THE KING ASKING THE KING TO GIVE

02:26:25.209 --> 02:26:29.413
US RIGHTS. NO, WE START OUT BY

02:26:29.480 --> 02:26:31.616
BIRTHRIGHT WITH FREEDOM. WE'RE

02:26:31.682 --> 02:26:33.351
NOT ASKING GOVERNMENT FOR OUR

02:26:33.417 --> 02:26:35.419
FREEDOMS. WE START OUT WITH OUR

02:26:35.486 --> 02:26:37.989
FREEDOMS. WHAT WE NOW REFLECT IS

02:26:38.055 --> 02:26:39.490
PEOPLE GETTING TOGETHER FOR THE

02:26:39.557 --> 02:26:40.958
GREATER GOOD, SAYING, HERE'S A

02:26:41.025 --> 02:26:42.426
COUPLE FREEDOMS, A COUPLE THINGS

02:26:42.493 --> 02:26:43.561
THAT WE'RE GOING TO GIVE TO

02:26:43.628 --> 02:26:47.365
GOVERNMENT. AN ABSOLUTE TSUNAMI

02:26:47.431 --> 02:26:49.901
OF THOUGHT CHANGE IN HUMAN

02:26:49.967 --> 02:26:52.470
HISTORY. AND OUR KIDS ARE NOT

02:26:52.537 --> 02:26:54.972
TAUGHT THIS TODAY, HOW

02:26:55.039 --> 02:26:56.007
GROUNDBREAKING THIS WAS. AND

02:26:56.073 --> 02:26:57.408
THEN I TALKED TO THEM HOW

02:26:57.475 --> 02:26:59.944
DISAPPOINTED I AM IN THE US

02:27:00.011 --> 02:27:00.578
CONSTITUTION, PHILOSOPHICALLY.

02:27:00.645 --> 02:27:01.946
OH, DON'T GET ME WRONG, I LOVE

02:27:02.013 --> 02:27:03.614
OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT. IT'S

02:27:03.681 --> 02:27:04.515
VERY ELEGANT. CHECKS AND

02:27:04.582 --> 02:27:05.416
BALANCES, SEPARATION OF POWERS

02:27:05.483 --> 02:27:07.218
AND ALL THAT WONDERFUL STUFF.

02:27:07.285 --> 02:27:10.755
BUT IT LACKED THE PASSION AND

02:27:10.821 --> 02:27:13.591
THE LOFTINESS OF THE DECLARATION

02:27:13.658 --> 02:27:17.261
OF INDEPENDENCE. IT WAS SUBDUED

02:27:17.328 --> 02:27:20.064
UNTIL THE 14TH AMENDMENT CAME

02:27:20.131 --> 02:27:22.600
ALONG. AND THEN I TIE IN HOW THE

02:27:22.667 --> 02:27:25.102
14TH AMENDMENT REALLY BRINGS THE

02:27:25.169 --> 02:27:26.938
SPIRIT OF THE DECLARATION OF

02:27:27.004 --> 02:27:29.006
INDEPENDENCE ABOUT FREEDOM,

02:27:29.073 --> 02:27:31.275
INALIENABLE RIGHTS, EQUAL

02:27:31.342 --> 02:27:34.145
PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW, AND

02:27:34.212 --> 02:27:35.880
ENSHRINES THAT IN OUR

02:27:35.947 --> 02:27:37.181
CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM AND MAKES

02:27:37.248 --> 02:27:38.816
IT A MORE PERFECT CONSTITUTIONAL

02:27:38.883 --> 02:27:40.084
SYSTEM. THE REASON WHY I GO

02:27:40.151 --> 02:27:41.485
THROUGH THIS IS I MISS THOSE

02:27:41.552 --> 02:27:43.888
SHOWS. THEY'RE STILL ON PODCASTS

02:27:43.955 --> 02:27:47.992
SOMEWHERE, BUT IF I HAD ONE WISH

02:27:48.059 --> 02:27:50.795
TODAY BESIDES VOTING FOR THIS

02:27:50.861 --> 02:27:53.297
RESOLUTION, IT WOULD BE TO VOTE

02:27:53.364 --> 02:27:57.401
TO REQUIRE THAT CIVICS BE ONE OF

02:27:57.468 --> 02:27:58.569
THE TOP PRIORITIES OF

02:27:58.636 --> 02:28:00.438
INSTRUCTION IN OUR SCHOOLS

02:28:00.504 --> 02:28:01.572
ACROSS EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT. I

02:28:01.639 --> 02:28:02.940
KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF DEBATE

02:28:03.007 --> 02:28:04.809
ABOUT CURRICULUM AND A LOT OF

02:28:04.875 --> 02:28:05.943
CONTROVERSY AROUND IT, AND

02:28:06.010 --> 02:28:07.178
PERHAPS MANY OF THOSE THINGS

02:28:07.245 --> 02:28:08.512
COULD BE SOLVED IF WE JUST

02:28:08.579 --> 02:28:09.614
SIMPLY SAID, LET'S DEAL WITH

02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:11.682
THAT AT HOME. BUT AT LEAST LET'S

02:28:11.749 --> 02:28:13.517
MAKE SURE WE GET THE BASICS

02:28:13.584 --> 02:28:14.118
READING, WRITING, ARITHMETIC,

02:28:14.185 --> 02:28:16.887
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, CIVICS.

02:28:16.954 --> 02:28:18.623
I'LL CLOSE ON THIS IF YOU WANT

02:28:18.689 --> 02:28:21.292
TO LOOK FOR EVIDENCE OF THE NEED

02:28:21.359 --> 02:28:22.793
FOR CIVICS. I WORRY ABOUT A

02:28:22.860 --> 02:28:25.763
GENERATION FROM NOW. WHETHER

02:28:25.830 --> 02:28:27.531
THAT NEXT GENERATION WILL BE

02:28:27.598 --> 02:28:29.467
ABLE TO HAVE AS INFORMED A

02:28:29.533 --> 02:28:31.068
DISCUSSION ON OUR SYSTEM OF

02:28:31.135 --> 02:28:34.605
GOVERNMENT AS WE CAN HAVE. AND

02:28:34.672 --> 02:28:36.474
IF YOU LOOK FOR PROOF, LOOK AT

02:28:36.540 --> 02:28:37.675
THOSE LATE NIGHT TALK SHOWS

02:28:37.742 --> 02:28:39.443
WHERE THEY TAKE THAT MAN ON THE

02:28:39.510 --> 02:28:40.778
STREET OR WOMAN ON THE STREET

02:28:40.845 --> 02:28:43.014
CAMERA, AND THEY ASK ABOUT HOW

02:28:43.080 --> 02:28:44.415
MANY BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT ARE

02:28:44.482 --> 02:28:45.816
THERE. AND SOME OF THESE KIDS,

02:28:45.883 --> 02:28:48.019
THEY DON'T KNOW. THEY SIMPLY

02:28:48.085 --> 02:28:50.788
DON'T KNOW. I THINK A LOT OF OUR

02:28:50.855 --> 02:28:53.758
DIFFERENCES COULD POTENTIALLY BE

02:28:53.824 --> 02:28:56.727
REDUCED IF OUR IF OUR OF OUR IF

02:28:56.794 --> 02:28:58.562
OUR CHILDREN WERE ACTUALLY GIVEN

02:28:58.629 --> 02:29:00.097
A GOOD GROUNDING IN OUR SYSTEM

02:29:00.164 --> 02:29:01.766
OF GOVERNMENT AND THE UNIQUENESS

02:29:01.832 --> 02:29:03.634
OF IT. SO MY HOPE IS THAT THAT

02:29:03.701 --> 02:29:05.269
WILL EXTEND TO SOME OTHER

02:29:05.336 --> 02:29:06.604
LEGISLATION IN THE COMING DAYS.

02:29:06.671 --> 02:29:08.873
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

02:29:08.939 --> 02:29:10.741
MEMBER MAYO PETER GALLAGHER, YOU

02:29:10.808 --> 02:29:13.978
ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MR.

02:29:14.045 --> 02:29:15.813
SPEAKER. MEMBERS, I ALSO RISE IN

02:29:15.880 --> 02:29:18.249
SUPPORT OF THE RESOLUTION AND

02:29:18.316 --> 02:29:21.452
THINKING ABOUT GROWING UP AND

02:29:21.519 --> 02:29:22.853
4TH OF JULY CELEBRATIONS. WHEN I

02:29:22.920 --> 02:29:25.489
WHEN I GREW UP, WE WOULD OFTEN

02:29:25.556 --> 02:29:28.059
GO UP TO LAKE ALMANOR, WHICH IS

02:29:28.125 --> 02:29:31.862
JUST NORTH EAST OF CHICO, AND

02:29:31.929 --> 02:29:33.364
THEY HAVE A GREAT PARADE UP

02:29:33.431 --> 02:29:34.598
THERE, BY THE WAY, Tê IN

02:29:34.665 --> 02:29:36.867
CHESTER, CALIFORNIA. AND I'D

02:29:36.934 --> 02:29:38.402
INVITE YOU GUYS TO COME UP

02:29:38.469 --> 02:29:40.037
ANYTIME. AND YES, THEY DO HAVE

02:29:40.104 --> 02:29:41.238
SUPER SOAKERS AND THEY AND THEY

02:29:41.305 --> 02:29:43.240
SQUIRT YOU FROM THE FIRE TRUCKS

02:29:43.307 --> 02:29:44.909
AND IT'S GREAT. YOU'D HAVE A

02:29:44.975 --> 02:29:46.911
REALLY GREAT TIME UP THERE. SO

02:29:46.977 --> 02:29:48.412
THE GENTLEMAN FROM PASADENA,

02:29:48.479 --> 02:29:52.450
YOU'RE WELCOME ANY TIME. BUT TWO

02:29:52.516 --> 02:29:54.552
THINGS REALLY COME TO ME WHEN I,

02:29:54.618 --> 02:29:56.721
WHEN I THINK ABOUT 4TH OF JULY.

02:29:56.787 --> 02:29:59.957
ONE IS, IS OUR SOLDIERS, OUR

02:30:00.024 --> 02:30:02.126
VETERANS. AND I CAN REMEMBER ONE

02:30:02.193 --> 02:30:05.796
OF THOSE 4TH OF JULY

02:30:05.863 --> 02:30:07.798
CELEBRATIONS WHEN I WAS A KID.

02:30:07.865 --> 02:30:11.969
MY UNCLE HAD BEEN DEPLOYED. TO

02:30:12.036 --> 02:30:15.139
THE GULF WAR, AND HE HAD MORE

02:30:15.206 --> 02:30:18.275
RECENTLY GOTTEN BACK. AND LIKE I

02:30:18.342 --> 02:30:22.646
REMEMBER JUST HOW. YOU KNOW, HOW

02:30:22.713 --> 02:30:25.483
HAPPY MY HIS FAMILY WAS TO HAVE

02:30:25.549 --> 02:30:27.251
HIM BACK HOME. RIGHT. AND THAT

02:30:27.318 --> 02:30:29.487
MOMENT AND REALLY, I THINK THAT

02:30:29.553 --> 02:30:30.388
WAS MAYBE THE FIRST TIME IT

02:30:30.454 --> 02:30:32.790
REALLY HIT ME AS A KID THAT, YOU

02:30:32.857 --> 02:30:34.558
KNOW, FREEDOM ISN'T FREE AND

02:30:34.625 --> 02:30:36.060
THAT THERE'S PEOPLE THAT PUT

02:30:36.127 --> 02:30:38.529
SOME MAJOR SACRIFICES ONLINE.

02:30:38.596 --> 02:30:40.231
AND FIRST AND FOREMOST, OUR

02:30:40.297 --> 02:30:42.500
SOLDIERS. AND I'M GLAD THAT OUR

02:30:42.566 --> 02:30:45.369
THE GENTLEMAN FROM COACHELLA

02:30:45.436 --> 02:30:47.405
BROUGHT THAT UP. I THINK A LOT

02:30:47.471 --> 02:30:49.640
ABOUT THAT. MY BOTH OF MY

02:30:49.707 --> 02:30:50.241
GRANDFATHERS WERE VETERANS OF

02:30:50.307 --> 02:30:54.779
WORLD WAR TWO. AND WHEN WE

02:30:54.845 --> 02:30:56.380
REALLY THINK ABOUT WHAT WHAT

02:30:56.447 --> 02:30:58.716
THOSE MEN AND WOMEN DO, I THINK

02:30:58.783 --> 02:31:00.050
THAT IT IT REALLY GETS US BACK

02:31:00.117 --> 02:31:02.353
TO REALLY THE FUNDAMENTALS OF

02:31:02.420 --> 02:31:04.155
AMERICA AND WHAT THIS MEANS AND

02:31:04.221 --> 02:31:05.790
WHAT WE'RE FIGHTING FOR AND WHAT

02:31:05.856 --> 02:31:07.758
THOSE SOLDIERS ARE FIGHTING FOR.

02:31:07.825 --> 02:31:09.927
AND SO I THINK THAT'S ONE THING

02:31:09.994 --> 02:31:11.629
THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

02:31:11.695 --> 02:31:13.631
US TO REALLY KIND OF THINK ABOUT

02:31:13.697 --> 02:31:15.599
AND PONDER ON ON THE 4TH OF

02:31:15.666 --> 02:31:18.202
JULY. AND THE OTHER ONE IS

02:31:18.269 --> 02:31:18.936
FREEDOM. I THINK IT'S REALLY

02:31:19.003 --> 02:31:22.640
SIMPLE FREEDOM, SIMPLE THING

02:31:22.706 --> 02:31:25.910
THAT I THINK WE TAKE FOR GRANTED

02:31:25.976 --> 02:31:29.513
TOO OFTEN, MAYBE ESPECIALLY NOW.

02:31:29.580 --> 02:31:31.081
THAT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL THING

02:31:31.148 --> 02:31:32.483
ABOUT AMERICA THAT HAS ALWAYS

02:31:32.550 --> 02:31:34.418
BEEN SO DIFFERENT IS BECAUSE FOR

02:31:34.485 --> 02:31:36.554
SO MANY OF THE PLACES THAT WE

02:31:36.620 --> 02:31:38.255
CAME FROM, AND MOST OF US CAME

02:31:38.322 --> 02:31:41.091
FROM SOMEWHERE TO COME TO

02:31:41.158 --> 02:31:43.961
AMERICA, WE DID NOT HAVE THAT.

02:31:44.028 --> 02:31:46.096
WE DID NOT HAVE FREEDOM OF

02:31:46.163 --> 02:31:47.865
MOVEMENT. WE DIDN'T HAVE FREEDOM

02:31:47.932 --> 02:31:49.733
OF THOUGHT. WE DIDN'T HAVE

02:31:49.800 --> 02:31:52.036
FREEDOM TO PURSUE OUR DREAMS, TO

02:31:52.102 --> 02:31:56.774
HAVE PROPERTY RIGHTS. AND THAT'S

02:31:56.841 --> 02:31:58.342
WHERE THE AMERICAN IDEAL IS SO

02:31:58.409 --> 02:31:59.777
DIFFERENT THAT FOR THE FIRST

02:31:59.844 --> 02:32:01.645
TIME REALLY IN HUMAN HISTORY,

02:32:01.712 --> 02:32:03.447
THERE WAS A PROMOTION OF

02:32:03.514 --> 02:32:04.715
FREEDOM, THE ABILITY TO PURSUE

02:32:04.782 --> 02:32:06.584
THOSE THINGS, AND MOSTLY FREEDOM

02:32:06.650 --> 02:32:09.587
FROM GOVERNMENT. LIKE THE

02:32:09.653 --> 02:32:10.521
FUNDAMENTAL THING THAT I THINK

02:32:10.588 --> 02:32:11.522
OUR FOUNDING FATHERS WERE

02:32:11.589 --> 02:32:13.557
TALKING ABOUT IS FREEDOM FROM,

02:32:13.624 --> 02:32:14.725
LIKE GOVERNMENTS THAT WOULD COME

02:32:14.792 --> 02:32:15.526
TOGETHER AND TAKE THOSE THINGS

02:32:15.593 --> 02:32:19.697
AWAY FROM PEOPLE AND DECIDE THAT

02:32:19.763 --> 02:32:20.798
THEY KNEW BETTER AND THAT YOU

02:32:20.865 --> 02:32:23.267
SHOULDN'T HAVE THOSE THINGS. AND

02:32:23.334 --> 02:32:25.669
EQUALITY, BUT EQUALITY UNDER THE

02:32:25.736 --> 02:32:27.171
LAW, THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL

02:32:27.238 --> 02:32:29.306
THING, THAT THE LAW SHOULDN'T

02:32:29.373 --> 02:32:31.542
TREAT YOU DIFFERENTLY BASED ON

02:32:31.609 --> 02:32:33.310
WHO YOU ARE OR WHERE YOU CAME

02:32:33.377 --> 02:32:35.613
FROM, OR WHAT FAITH YOU

02:32:35.679 --> 02:32:38.682
PRACTICED. THE LAW SHOULD BE

02:32:38.749 --> 02:32:44.121
EQUAL FOR ALL. AND YOU KNOW, AS

02:32:44.188 --> 02:32:48.359
WE AS. ELECTED MEMBERS OF THIS

02:32:48.425 --> 02:32:49.493
GOVERNMENT, WE SHOULD REALLY

02:32:49.560 --> 02:32:50.728
CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT THAT.

02:32:50.794 --> 02:32:52.630
ARE WE CONTINUING TO PROMOTE

02:32:52.696 --> 02:32:54.198
THAT FREEDOM AND KEEP THAT

02:32:54.265 --> 02:32:57.067
FREEDOM? BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, WHEN

02:32:57.134 --> 02:32:58.502
THEY CAME OUT OF THE

02:32:58.569 --> 02:32:59.870
CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTIONS, THEY

02:32:59.937 --> 02:33:02.439
ASKED HIM, WHAT GOVERNMENT HAVE

02:33:02.506 --> 02:33:06.010
YOU GIVEN US? AND HE SAID, A

02:33:06.076 --> 02:33:09.213
REPUBLIC, IF YOU CAN KEEP IT.

02:33:09.280 --> 02:33:10.447
THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS

02:33:10.514 --> 02:33:12.583
THERE. REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT

02:33:12.650 --> 02:33:15.352
SAID EARLIER THAT IS WHAT WE

02:33:15.419 --> 02:33:16.754
HAVE THE ABILITY TO ELECT OUR

02:33:16.820 --> 02:33:20.824
OWN LEADERS. RIGHT. AND TO HAVE

02:33:20.891 --> 02:33:22.259
REPRESENTATIVE BODIES LIKE THIS

02:33:22.326 --> 02:33:25.496
ONE THAT WERE IN WAS REALLY NOT

02:33:25.563 --> 02:33:27.264
VERY WELL KNOWN TO HUMAN HISTORY

02:33:27.331 --> 02:33:29.934
BEFORE WE HAD THE AMERICAN FORM

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:33.470
OF GOVERNMENT. AND THERE IS A

02:33:33.537 --> 02:33:34.738
STEWARDSHIP THAT COMES WITH

02:33:34.805 --> 02:33:39.810
THAT. THAT WE ALL HAVE. BUT IT

02:33:39.877 --> 02:33:42.079
IS TO PROMOTE THAT FREEDOM AND

02:33:42.146 --> 02:33:45.149
ULTIMATELY TO KEEP IT. AND THAT

02:33:45.215 --> 02:33:47.217
I THINK MANY OF OUR LEADERS,

02:33:47.284 --> 02:33:49.553
GREAT LEADERS OVER TIME, HAVE

02:33:49.620 --> 02:33:50.654
ENCOURAGED US THAT THAT SACRED

02:33:50.721 --> 02:33:52.923
FIRE OF LIBERTY MUST BE

02:33:52.990 --> 02:33:54.925
STEWARDED, IT MUST BE KEPT. IT'S

02:33:54.992 --> 02:33:56.460
NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN TAKE FOR

02:33:56.527 --> 02:33:58.228
GRANTED. AND SO AS WE SIT HERE

02:33:58.295 --> 02:34:00.531
ON THIS FLOOR TODAY AND I'M GLAD

02:34:00.598 --> 02:34:01.665
WE'RE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION, I

02:34:01.732 --> 02:34:03.701
DON'T THINK WE WERE MAYBE

02:34:03.767 --> 02:34:04.368
EXPECTING THIS TO MAYBE GO ON AS

02:34:04.435 --> 02:34:07.204
LONG AS IT DID, BUT I'M REALLY

02:34:07.271 --> 02:34:10.507
GLAD THAT THIS HAPPENED, BECAUSE

02:34:10.574 --> 02:34:11.475
I THINK IT REALLY HELPS US

02:34:11.542 --> 02:34:13.410
REFLECT ON THE THINGS THAT ARE

02:34:13.477 --> 02:34:15.145
TRULY IMPORTANT AND FUNDAMENTAL

02:34:15.212 --> 02:34:17.247
TO OUR OUR GOVERNMENT, OUR WAY

02:34:17.314 --> 02:34:22.252
OF LIFE, AND CERTAINLY FOR ME IS

02:34:22.319 --> 02:34:24.922
AN ENCOURAGEMENT TO CONTINUE TO

02:34:24.989 --> 02:34:25.956
STEWARD THAT SACRED FIRE OF

02:34:26.023 --> 02:34:28.425
LIBERTY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU,

02:34:28.492 --> 02:34:29.893
LEADER GALLAGHER, ASSEMBLY

02:34:29.960 --> 02:34:31.495
MEMBER RUBIO, YOU ARE

02:34:31.562 --> 02:34:32.930
RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MR.

02:34:32.997 --> 02:34:36.600
SPEAKER. AND MEMBERS, I WANT TO

02:34:36.667 --> 02:34:39.703
TALK ABOUT THE HONOR THAT I HAVE

02:34:39.770 --> 02:34:42.940
HAD. I BECAME A CITIZEN 30 YEARS

02:34:43.007 --> 02:34:45.542
AGO. LAST NOVEMBER. MY PARENTS

02:34:45.609 --> 02:34:48.646
AS WELL, AND IT WAS ALWAYS A

02:34:48.712 --> 02:34:50.114
DREAM. UNFORTUNATELY, RIGHT NOW

02:34:50.180 --> 02:34:51.782
OUR CONSTITUTION IS GOING

02:34:51.849 --> 02:34:53.083
THROUGH A LITTLE BIT OF A

02:34:53.150 --> 02:34:54.852
SHAKEUP. MY PARENTS LIVE IN THE

02:34:54.918 --> 02:34:56.620
CITY OF BELL, AND THEY HAVEN'T

02:34:56.687 --> 02:34:58.789
LEFT THE HOUSE IN THREE WEEKS

02:34:58.856 --> 02:35:00.157
BECAUSE MY PARENTS DON'T SPEAK

02:35:00.224 --> 02:35:01.959
ENGLISH VERY WELL, AND MY DAD

02:35:02.026 --> 02:35:03.727
SAYS THAT IF HE GOES OUT AND HE

02:35:03.794 --> 02:35:07.498
GETS PICKED UP BY ANYBODY, HE

02:35:07.564 --> 02:35:10.067
WON'T BE ABLE TO DEFEND HIMSELF.

02:35:10.134 --> 02:35:11.368
SO TALKING ABOUT THOSE FREEDOMS

02:35:11.435 --> 02:35:14.338
THAT THE CONSTITUTION AFFORDS US

02:35:14.405 --> 02:35:15.739
RIGHT NOW, AT THIS MOMENT, IT IS

02:35:15.806 --> 02:35:18.842
NOT TRUE FOR MY PARENTS. AND BUT

02:35:18.909 --> 02:35:20.744
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT JUST

02:35:20.811 --> 02:35:22.613
THAT. I ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT

02:35:22.680 --> 02:35:25.049
HOW AMAZING THE PROCESS WAS. IT

02:35:25.115 --> 02:35:27.584
WAS A LONG PROCESS. WE STARTED

02:35:27.651 --> 02:35:31.221
OUR PAPERWORK IN 1990, AND IT

02:35:31.288 --> 02:35:32.923
TOOK FOUR YEARS FOR US TO BE

02:35:32.990 --> 02:35:36.627
CALLED TO TAKE THE TEST. SO WHEN

02:35:36.694 --> 02:35:39.496
WE TALK ABOUT CIVICS, THERE ARE

02:35:39.563 --> 02:35:41.498
100 QUESTIONS THAT YOU MUST

02:35:41.565 --> 02:35:43.000
MEMORIZE BECAUSE WHEN YOU GO IN

02:35:43.067 --> 02:35:45.502
TO TAKE THE TEST, YOU WILL BE

02:35:45.569 --> 02:35:47.304
ASKED ANYWHERE BETWEEN 5 AND 10

02:35:47.371 --> 02:35:49.540
QUESTIONS. VERY RANDOM. AND MY

02:35:49.606 --> 02:35:50.908
PARENTS AND WE STUDIED AND

02:35:50.974 --> 02:35:52.509
STUDIED AND STUDIED. SO YOU CAN

02:35:52.576 --> 02:35:54.511
ASK ME, I CAN STILL ANSWER MOST

02:35:54.578 --> 02:35:57.815
OF THEM, BUT THEY STUDIED SO

02:35:57.881 --> 02:35:59.683
THAT THEY CAN GO TAKE THAT TEST.

02:35:59.750 --> 02:36:01.585
SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CIVICS,

02:36:01.652 --> 02:36:03.587
THE FOLKS THAT ARE BEING

02:36:03.654 --> 02:36:05.322
NATURALIZED KNOW ALL THOSE

02:36:05.389 --> 02:36:06.857
QUESTIONS, BECAUSE THAT IS ONE

02:36:06.924 --> 02:36:08.659
OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF BECOMING

02:36:08.726 --> 02:36:10.294
A US CITIZEN, A NATURALIZED

02:36:10.360 --> 02:36:12.529
CITIZEN. SO I WANT TO JUST TALK

02:36:12.596 --> 02:36:14.898
ABOUT HOW GRATEFUL I AND MY

02:36:14.965 --> 02:36:18.168
FAMILY HAVE BEEN TO BE. HERE. IT

02:36:18.235 --> 02:36:20.504
WE TALK ABOUT THE AMERICAN DREAM

02:36:20.571 --> 02:36:22.573
HOME OWNERSHIP. AND RIGHT NOW I

02:36:22.639 --> 02:36:25.242
THINK ALL OF OUR FAMILY HAS HAD

02:36:25.309 --> 02:36:27.945
THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUY A HOME.

02:36:28.011 --> 02:36:30.147
MY HUSBAND IS ALSO NATURALIZED

02:36:30.214 --> 02:36:33.016
AND I HAVE MY HUSBAND IS A

02:36:33.083 --> 02:36:35.119
FORMER MARINE. MY STEPDAUGHTER

02:36:35.185 --> 02:36:36.720
GRADUATED FROM THE NAVAL ACADEMY

02:36:36.787 --> 02:36:39.223
AS A PILOT SCHOOL. RIGHT NOW MY

02:36:39.289 --> 02:36:40.891
STEPSON IS IN THE AIR FORCE

02:36:40.958 --> 02:36:42.493
ACADEMY, AND HE'S ALSO GOING TO

02:36:42.559 --> 02:36:44.328
BE A PILOT. AND MY BROTHER IS AN

02:36:44.394 --> 02:36:47.164
ARMY VETERAN. SO FOR US, THE

02:36:47.231 --> 02:36:50.067
PRIDE THAT WE HOLD THAT WE HAVE

02:36:50.134 --> 02:36:51.535
TO BE ABLE TO COME TO THIS

02:36:51.602 --> 02:36:53.437
COUNTRY AND BE WHATEVER,

02:36:53.504 --> 02:36:55.172
LITERALLY WHATEVER WE WANTED TO

02:36:55.239 --> 02:36:57.608
BE. I NEVER THOUGHT IN MY WHOLE

02:36:57.674 --> 02:36:58.942
ENTIRE LIFE THAT I WOULD BE

02:36:59.009 --> 02:37:01.178
STANDING IN THIS, IN THIS FLOOR,

02:37:01.245 --> 02:37:05.115
MY PARENTS HAVE THE HONOR OF NOT

02:37:05.182 --> 02:37:07.317
JUST ONE DAUGHTER THAT'S IN THE

02:37:07.384 --> 02:37:08.685
LEGISLATURE, BUT TWO. SENATOR

02:37:08.752 --> 02:37:11.522
SUSAN RUBIO, MY SISTER, ALSO

02:37:11.588 --> 02:37:13.290
SHARES THE SAME STORY THAT I DO.

02:37:13.357 --> 02:37:16.527
WE WERE THE FIRST NATURALIZED, I

02:37:16.593 --> 02:37:20.297
GUESS, OR FORMERLY UNDOCUMENTED

02:37:20.364 --> 02:37:22.466
CITIZENS THAT SIT ON THIS FLOOR.

02:37:22.533 --> 02:37:24.568
AND I KNOW THERE'S MANY MORE TO

02:37:24.635 --> 02:37:26.603
COME, BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IF WE

02:37:26.670 --> 02:37:29.573
WORK HARD AND DO EVERYTHING THAT

02:37:29.640 --> 02:37:31.241
WE CAN SERVE OUR COMMUNITIES,

02:37:31.308 --> 02:37:33.076
GIVE BACK TO THE COMMUNITY, WE

02:37:33.143 --> 02:37:34.978
CAN ALL COME HERE. AND SO FOR

02:37:35.045 --> 02:37:37.948
ME, THE PRIDE THAT MY PARENTS

02:37:38.015 --> 02:37:40.450
HAVE EVERY SINGLE TIME THAT THEY

02:37:40.517 --> 02:37:41.685
COME UP TO THE LEGISLATURE,

02:37:41.752 --> 02:37:43.253
YOU'LL SEE MY DAD. MANY OF YOU

02:37:43.320 --> 02:37:44.888
HAVE MET HIM, BARELY CAN SPEAK

02:37:44.955 --> 02:37:46.423
ENGLISH, BUT HE CAN COMMUNICATE

02:37:46.490 --> 02:37:48.258
THAT HIS DAUGHTERS ARE IN THE

02:37:48.325 --> 02:37:50.794
LEGISLATURE. AND SO THAT THAT IS

02:37:50.861 --> 02:37:53.030
WHAT THE CONSTITUTION AND WHAT

02:37:53.096 --> 02:37:56.200
THE GREAT COUNTRY OF THE UNITED

02:37:56.266 --> 02:37:58.135
STATES HAVE AFFORDED MY FAMILY.

02:37:58.202 --> 02:38:01.572
AND SO I'M IN SUPPORT OF THE

02:38:01.638 --> 02:38:03.841
RESOLUTION AND REALLY URGE THAT

02:38:03.907 --> 02:38:07.010
WE DO THINK ABOUT THOSE FREEDOMS

02:38:07.077 --> 02:38:08.812
RIGHT NOW. THEY'RE NOT AVAILABLE

02:38:08.879 --> 02:38:10.614
TO EVERYONE. AND IF WE TRULY,

02:38:10.681 --> 02:38:12.482
TRULY BELIEVE THAT THE

02:38:12.549 --> 02:38:14.551
CONSTITUTION AFFORDS US THAT WE

02:38:14.618 --> 02:38:15.819
NEED TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF EACH

02:38:15.886 --> 02:38:17.521
OTHER INSTEAD OF KNOCKING EACH

02:38:17.588 --> 02:38:20.657
OTHER DOWN WHEN WE SPEAK ABOUT

02:38:20.724 --> 02:38:22.793
THOSE FREEDOMS, WE NEED TO THINK

02:38:22.860 --> 02:38:25.095
ABOUT EVERYONE, NOT JUST

02:38:25.162 --> 02:38:25.996
OURSELVES, BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE

02:38:26.063 --> 02:38:29.366
TEND TO FIGURE OUT THAT IF IT'S

02:38:29.433 --> 02:38:31.368
NOT HAPPENING TO ME, THEN IT'S

02:38:31.435 --> 02:38:32.903
NOT HAPPENING. BUT IT'S GOING TO

02:38:32.970 --> 02:38:34.671
HAPPEN. IF WE DON'T STAND UP AND

02:38:34.738 --> 02:38:37.174
PROTECT THAT SACRED PAPER, THE

02:38:37.241 --> 02:38:39.343
CONSTITUTION, TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:38:39.409 --> 02:38:41.178
THOSE LIBERTIES ARE AFFORDED TO

02:38:41.245 --> 02:38:42.880
EVERYONE AND THAT ALL OF US,

02:38:42.946 --> 02:38:46.583
INCLUDING OUR CHILDREN, ARE ABLE

02:38:46.650 --> 02:38:47.751
TO STAND PROUD EVERY SINGLE DAY

02:38:47.818 --> 02:38:52.022
LIKE I DO, KNOWING THAT THIS IS

02:38:52.089 --> 02:38:53.423
THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE

02:38:53.490 --> 02:38:55.459
WORLD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

02:38:55.525 --> 02:38:57.060
ASSEMBLYMEMBER RUBIO, ASSEMBLY

02:38:57.127 --> 02:38:58.762
MEMBER BERNER, YOU'RE

02:38:58.829 --> 02:39:00.297
RECOGNIZED. YES. I RISE IN

02:39:00.364 --> 02:39:03.767
SUPPORT OF H.R. 47 AT THE

02:39:03.834 --> 02:39:05.335
REQUEST OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN

02:39:05.402 --> 02:39:07.905
DIEGO. SHE REMINDED ME, I SHOULD

02:39:07.971 --> 02:39:09.907
POINT OUT THAT ONE OF THE BEST

02:39:09.973 --> 02:39:11.408
4TH OF JULY PARADES IN THE STATE

02:39:11.475 --> 02:39:14.611
OF CALIFORNIA IS ON CORONADO ON

02:39:14.678 --> 02:39:16.380
FRIDAY, AND I GET THE PLEASURE

02:39:16.446 --> 02:39:19.683
OF BEING IN IT, AND IT IS A

02:39:19.750 --> 02:39:20.417
GREAT CELEBRATION. PEOPLE FROM

02:39:20.484 --> 02:39:22.352
ALL OVER SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND

02:39:22.419 --> 02:39:24.321
THE SOUTHWEST COME OUT. THE

02:39:24.388 --> 02:39:25.822
STREETS ARE LINED, IT'S LONG,

02:39:25.889 --> 02:39:28.091
AND WE ALL GET TOGETHER TO

02:39:28.158 --> 02:39:29.760
CELEBRATE WHAT UNITES US. AND I

02:39:29.826 --> 02:39:31.528
THINK OFTEN WE TALK ABOUT WHAT

02:39:31.595 --> 02:39:33.030
DIVIDES US, BUT WHAT UNITES US

02:39:33.096 --> 02:39:35.532
IS STRONGER. AND UNLIKE MY

LEARN ABOUT THE DECLARATION OF

02:39:44.341 --> 02:39:46.376
HAD GREAT CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

02:39:46.443 --> 02:39:48.045
IT. WHAT DOES FREEDOM MEAN? MY

02:39:48.111 --> 02:39:49.546

02:39:49.613 --> 02:39:51.448

02:39:55.786 --> 02:39:57.821

THINGS THAT DEFINES US AS

02:48:43.847 --> 02:48:45.748
GOING TO MOVE FORWARD OR NOT.

02:48:45.815 --> 02:48:49.219
THEY GET TWO MONTHS AHEAD OF

02:48:49.285 --> 02:48:51.821
TIME THERE TO DEAL WITH THAT.

02:48:51.888 --> 02:48:53.823
SECTION THREE Ã. UPON

02:48:53.890 --> 02:48:55.692
NOTIFICATION, THE TRIBE HAS

02:48:55.758 --> 02:48:57.393
ELECTED TO CONSULT LOCAL

02:48:57.460 --> 02:48:59.596
GOVERNMENT HAS 14 DAYS TO

02:48:59.662 --> 02:49:02.098
INITIATE THE CONSULTATION THAT

02:49:02.165 --> 02:49:04.501
STARTS THE PROCESS. THAT AGAIN

02:49:04.567 --> 02:49:07.871
IS ANOTHER 60 DAYS, 45 DAYS AND

02:49:07.937 --> 02:49:09.339
UPON THE REQUEST OF THE TRIBE,

02:49:09.405 --> 02:49:12.609
AN ADDITIONAL 15 DAYS, 60 DAYS

02:49:12.675 --> 02:49:16.479
IN TOTAL, THREE B SHALL GIVE

02:49:16.546 --> 02:49:17.914
DEFERENCE TO TRIBAL KNOWLEDGE

02:49:17.981 --> 02:49:20.383
AND CUSTOMS AND SIGNIFICANCE OF

02:49:20.450 --> 02:49:22.652
CULTURAL RESOURCES TO THE TRIBE

02:49:22.719 --> 02:49:25.555
THAT WAS NOT INCLUDED IN PRIOR

02:49:25.622 --> 02:49:28.491
LEGISLATION. THREE C THE TRIBE

02:49:28.558 --> 02:49:32.428
HAS STRONG SAY, AND HAS THE ONLY

02:49:32.495 --> 02:49:34.230
SAY TO ALLOW THE PROJECT

02:49:34.297 --> 02:49:37.066
PROPONENT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE

02:49:37.133 --> 02:49:38.268
CONSULTATION WITH THE APPROVAL

02:49:38.334 --> 02:49:43.206
OF THE TRIBE. SECTION D THREE

02:49:43.273 --> 02:49:45.642
CONSULTATION SHALL SEEK TO FIND

02:49:45.708 --> 02:49:47.110
MEASURES THAT WOULD AVOID

02:49:47.176 --> 02:49:48.912
SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS TO TRIBAL

02:49:48.978 --> 02:49:52.882
CULTURAL RESOURCES. SECTION F

02:49:52.949 --> 02:49:54.684
CONSULTATION SHALL CONCLUDE

02:49:54.751 --> 02:49:57.921
WITHIN 60 DAYS OF INITIATION OF

02:49:57.987 --> 02:50:00.089
CONSULTATION. THIS LAYS OUT A

02:50:00.156 --> 02:50:03.660
PROCESS OF CLOSE TO POTENTIALLY

02:50:03.726 --> 02:50:06.095
148 DAYS OF CONSULTATION AND

02:50:06.162 --> 02:50:09.832
GOING BACK AND FORTH. WE ALSO

02:50:09.899 --> 02:50:14.070
GOT IN THIS NEGOTIATION BINDING

02:50:14.137 --> 02:50:15.772
BINDING AGREEMENTS ON THE

02:50:15.838 --> 02:50:16.940
CONDITION OF APPROVAL FROM THE

02:50:17.006 --> 02:50:19.542
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR THE FIRST

02:50:19.609 --> 02:50:22.045
TIME, THAT THERE IS ANY

02:50:22.111 --> 02:50:23.813
ENFORCEABLE AGREEMENTS REACHED

02:50:23.880 --> 02:50:25.648
DURING PROJECT CONSULTATION,

02:50:25.715 --> 02:50:28.418
THAT IT SHALL BE IMPLEMENTED.

02:50:28.484 --> 02:50:31.054
ALSO, WE GOT IN THERE UPON THE

02:50:31.120 --> 02:50:33.590
REQUEST OF THE TRIBE. TRIBAL

02:50:33.656 --> 02:50:36.092
MONITORS WILL BE APPROVED AND

02:50:36.159 --> 02:50:38.227
THROUGH ANY GROUND, DISTURBING

02:50:38.294 --> 02:50:40.830
ACTIVITIES NEVER DONE BEFORE,

02:50:40.897 --> 02:50:42.899
AND THE APPLICANT SHALL

02:50:42.966 --> 02:50:45.101
COMPENSATE THE TRIBAL MONITORS

02:50:45.168 --> 02:50:47.303
NEVER DONE BEFORE. THAT'S A

02:50:47.370 --> 02:50:49.038
STRONG COMPONENT TO MOVE

02:50:49.105 --> 02:50:52.642
FORWARD. ALSO, THE PROJECT SHALL

02:50:52.709 --> 02:50:56.879
COMPLY WITH SECTIONS 70, 50.5

02:50:56.946 --> 02:51:01.017
AND HEALTH SAFETY CODE 50 97.98,

02:51:01.084 --> 02:51:02.785
INCLUDING IMMEDIATE WORK

02:51:02.852 --> 02:51:05.254
STOPPAGE UPON DISCOVERY OF HUMAN

02:51:05.321 --> 02:51:07.357
REMAINS OF A BURIAL GROUND AND

02:51:07.423 --> 02:51:09.258
TREATMENT IN ACCORDANCE OF

02:51:09.325 --> 02:51:10.627
APPLICABLE LAW IN CONSULTATION

02:51:10.693 --> 02:51:13.529
WITH THE AFFECTED TRIBES. THESE

02:51:13.596 --> 02:51:15.798
ARE AREAS THAT WE WENT TO WORK

02:51:15.865 --> 02:51:19.002
ON MAY 28TH, WHEN AGAIN MAY

02:51:19.068 --> 02:51:20.637
28TH. THERE WAS NO PROTECTION

02:51:20.703 --> 02:51:21.871
FOR TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS. THERE

02:51:21.938 --> 02:51:24.107
WAS NO PROTECTION FOR CULTURAL

02:51:24.173 --> 02:51:26.809
RESOURCES. TODAY, IN AB 130, WE

02:51:26.876 --> 02:51:29.445
HAVE PROTECTIONS. DOES THIS GO

02:51:29.512 --> 02:51:31.414
FAR ENOUGH? SOME FEEL IT DOES

02:51:31.481 --> 02:51:33.950
NOT. SOME FEEL THAT IT DOES,

02:51:34.017 --> 02:51:35.084
ESPECIALLY THE DEVELOPERS THAT

02:51:35.151 --> 02:51:36.519
WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR

02:51:36.586 --> 02:51:39.489
COMPENSATION. BUT IN THE ART OF

02:51:39.555 --> 02:51:40.990
NEGOTIATION, IT IS ABOUT GIVE

02:51:41.057 --> 02:51:43.359
AND TAKE AND YOU REACH A

02:51:43.426 --> 02:51:44.761
COMPROMISE. I FEEL WE HAVE

02:51:44.827 --> 02:51:46.362
REACHED A PLACE WHERE

02:51:46.429 --> 02:51:47.864
PROTECTIONS ARE IN PLACE THAT

02:51:47.930 --> 02:51:50.166
THE PROTECTION, THAT INADVERTENT

02:51:50.233 --> 02:51:52.068
DISCOVERY OF NATIVE AMERICAN

02:51:52.135 --> 02:51:54.003
REMAINS DO HAVE A PROCESS TO

02:51:54.070 --> 02:51:56.272
MOVE FORWARD. THE NEGOTIATIONS

02:51:56.339 --> 02:51:58.241
THAT WE TALK ABOUT CONTINUE TO

02:51:58.307 --> 02:51:59.308
MOVE FORWARD. THAT GOT US TO

02:51:59.375 --> 02:52:01.711
THIS POINT, THAT, AGAIN, TO THIS

02:52:01.778 --> 02:52:03.946
BODY, WE HAD NO PROTECTIONS

02:52:04.013 --> 02:52:06.482
MOVING FORWARD. MAY 28TH, BUT WE

02:52:06.549 --> 02:52:08.151
WENT TO WORK AND GOT THESE

02:52:08.217 --> 02:52:09.252
PROTECTIONS THAT ARE IN FRONT OF

02:52:09.318 --> 02:52:10.953
US TODAY. SOME STILL FEEL WE

02:52:11.020 --> 02:52:13.923
NEED TO GO FARTHER, BUT IN THE

02:52:13.990 --> 02:52:14.991
ART OF NEGOTIATION, WE DID THE

02:52:15.058 --> 02:52:17.193
BEST THAT WE CAN. AND I FEEL I

02:52:17.260 --> 02:52:19.395
FEEL GOOD ABOUT THESE

02:52:19.462 --> 02:52:20.863
PROTECTIONS FOR CALIFORNIA'S

02:52:20.930 --> 02:52:23.499
FIRST PEOPLE. I ASK FOR YOUR

02:52:23.566 --> 02:52:25.968
VOTE OF AB 130. THANK YOU,

02:52:26.035 --> 02:52:28.871
ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS, ASSEMBLY

02:52:28.938 --> 02:52:29.872
MEMBER DE MAYO, YOU ARE

02:52:29.939 --> 02:52:36.245
RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, I RISE IN

02:52:36.312 --> 02:52:37.613
OPPOSITION TO AB 130, BUT I WANT

02:52:37.680 --> 02:52:39.382
TO START FIRST WITH AN

02:52:39.449 --> 02:52:41.050
ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT THE DEBATE

02:52:41.117 --> 02:52:43.553
OVER CEQA HAS MOVED

02:52:43.619 --> 02:52:44.954
SUBSTANTIALLY TO A MORE

02:52:45.021 --> 02:52:47.156
REALISTIC PLANE. I THINK THAT

02:52:47.223 --> 02:52:49.759
THERE IS NOW GROWING CONSENSUS

02:52:49.826 --> 02:52:53.229
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE, EVEN

02:52:53.296 --> 02:52:55.031
WITH STAKEHOLDER GROUPS, THAT

02:52:55.098 --> 02:52:59.068
CEQA IS BROKEN AND IT HAS VERY

02:52:59.135 --> 02:53:00.336
LITTLE TO DO TODAY WITH THE

02:53:00.403 --> 02:53:02.905
ENVIRONMENT. WE'VE GOT TO SCRAP

02:53:02.972 --> 02:53:07.343
IT, START OVER. THERE'S A BETTER

02:53:07.410 --> 02:53:08.945
WAY TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT.

02:53:09.011 --> 02:53:11.314
WHAT CEQA HAS DONE IS IT HAS

02:53:11.380 --> 02:53:13.449
IMPOSED COSTS ACROSS THE STATE

02:53:13.516 --> 02:53:15.151
OF CALIFORNIA, SPIKED THE COST

02:53:15.218 --> 02:53:17.653
OF LIVING DISPROPORTIONATELY

02:53:17.720 --> 02:53:23.893
HURTING THE WORKING CLASS. AND

02:53:23.960 --> 02:53:25.328
WE'VE RECEIVED VERY LITTLE VALUE

02:53:25.394 --> 02:53:27.396
IN RECENT YEARS, IN RECENT

02:53:27.463 --> 02:53:29.098
DECADES FROM CEQA. IN FACT,

02:53:29.165 --> 02:53:30.967
THERE'S SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF HOW

02:53:31.033 --> 02:53:33.503
CEQA HAS MADE IT HARDER TO DO

02:53:33.569 --> 02:53:35.972
GOOD ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS.

02:53:36.038 --> 02:53:39.275
THIS BILL DOES CONTAIN IMPORTANT

02:53:39.342 --> 02:53:41.077
REFORMS ON CEQA. THAT'S THE GOOD

02:53:41.144 --> 02:53:43.379
PART. THE CHALLENGE I HAVE WITH

02:53:43.446 --> 02:53:46.983
THE BILL IS THAT IT CONTINUES TO

02:53:47.049 --> 02:53:49.085
DOLE OUT MUCH NEEDED RELIEF ON

02:53:49.152 --> 02:53:52.522
SEQUA IN EXCHANGE FOR GIVEAWAYS

02:53:52.588 --> 02:53:54.924
TO SPECIAL INTERESTS, AND SO

02:53:54.991 --> 02:53:55.758
THEREFORE, THE SAVINGS THAT

02:53:55.825 --> 02:53:57.326
WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE BY

02:53:57.393 --> 02:53:58.694
CUTTING SOME OF THE RED TAPE ON

02:53:58.761 --> 02:54:01.364
THESE HOUSING PROJECTS, WHICH

02:54:01.430 --> 02:54:03.699
EVERYONE SUPPORTS, ARE NEGATED.

02:54:03.766 --> 02:54:05.968
AND I DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE

02:54:06.035 --> 02:54:09.505
PREVAILING WAGE REQUIREMENTS. IT

02:54:09.572 --> 02:54:11.307
MAKES NO SENSE TO SAY, OKAY,

02:54:11.374 --> 02:54:14.243
WE'RE GOING TO CUT SOME OF THE

02:54:14.310 --> 02:54:16.345
REGULATORY COSTS, THE LITIGATION

02:54:16.412 --> 02:54:17.814
COSTS, ONLY TO TURN AROUND AND

02:54:17.880 --> 02:54:19.615
SAY, WE'RE GOING TO SPIKE THE

02:54:19.682 --> 02:54:20.817
COST OF ACTUALLY CONSTRUCTING

02:54:20.883 --> 02:54:23.286
THE PROJECT PREVAILING WAGE BY

02:54:23.352 --> 02:54:27.557
AT LEAST 10%, TYPICALLY 25% COST

02:54:27.623 --> 02:54:29.025
INCREASE ON PROJECTS. AND NOW

02:54:29.091 --> 02:54:30.726
WE'RE GOING BEYOND PUBLIC WORKS

02:54:30.793 --> 02:54:32.428
PROJECTS INTO PRIVATE

02:54:32.495 --> 02:54:36.132
DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. WHY?

02:54:36.199 --> 02:54:37.266
BECAUSE THERE'S A POWERFUL

02:54:37.333 --> 02:54:39.068
INTEREST GROUP DEMANDING IT. I

02:54:39.135 --> 02:54:41.737
THINK WE SHOULD WE SHOULD STEP

02:54:41.804 --> 02:54:43.005
AWAY FROM THE SPECIAL INTEREST

02:54:43.072 --> 02:54:44.941
GROUPS. AND LET'S BUILD A THAT

02:54:45.007 --> 02:54:47.310
WORKS FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE

02:54:47.376 --> 02:54:48.878
LOBBYISTS, WHO DON'T HAVE

02:54:48.945 --> 02:54:50.613
INFLUENCE. IF YOU BUILD A SYSTEM

02:54:50.680 --> 02:54:53.216
FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO

02:54:53.282 --> 02:54:54.483
VOICE, THE PRIVILEGED CLASS WILL

02:54:54.550 --> 02:54:56.786
DO JUST FINE. THEY'LL BE

02:54:56.853 --> 02:54:59.388
PERFECTLY FINE. BUT LET'S PUT

02:54:59.455 --> 02:55:02.158
ASIDE THEIR THREATS, THEIR THEIR

02:55:02.225 --> 02:55:04.727
THEIR DEMANDS, AND LET'S BUILD A

02:55:04.794 --> 02:55:06.495
SYSTEM THAT WORKS FOR THE LITTLE

02:55:06.562 --> 02:55:08.965
GUY. SECOND THING IS THIS VMT,

02:55:09.031 --> 02:55:11.300
THE VEHICLE MILEAGE, VEHICLE

02:55:11.367 --> 02:55:14.103
MILES TRAVELED RACKET HAS

02:55:14.170 --> 02:55:16.272
NOTHING TO DO WITH REDUCING

02:55:16.339 --> 02:55:17.874
TRAFFIC OR CONGESTION. IN THIS

02:55:17.940 --> 02:55:19.642
BILL. IT'S CLEAR WE'RE USING IT

02:55:19.709 --> 02:55:20.910
TO SHAKE DOWN PROJECTS, TO TAKE

02:55:20.977 --> 02:55:23.179
THE MONEY AND THEN PUT IT INTO

02:55:23.246 --> 02:55:26.315
GOVERNMENT DIRECTED FUNDS.

02:55:26.382 --> 02:55:28.851
AGAIN, LET'S BE HONEST ABOUT

02:55:28.918 --> 02:55:30.987
WHAT VMT IS ALL ABOUT. IT'S

02:55:31.053 --> 02:55:33.189
ABOUT RAISING REVENUE ON

02:55:33.256 --> 02:55:34.757
DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, WHICH WHAT

02:55:34.824 --> 02:55:37.126
HAPPENS THERE. WE PASS THAT ON

02:55:37.193 --> 02:55:39.562
TO THOSE HOME BUYERS, INCREASING

02:55:39.629 --> 02:55:44.934
THE COST OF HOUSING. AGAIN,

02:55:45.001 --> 02:55:47.203
GOOD, GOOD PROGRESS. BUT IF WE

02:55:47.270 --> 02:55:49.839
WANT TO DO SOMETHING BOLD, WE

02:55:49.906 --> 02:55:52.675
WOULD, IN THIS CHAMBER LITERALLY

02:55:52.742 --> 02:55:54.076
REBOOT THE COMPUTER. WE WOULD

02:55:54.143 --> 02:55:55.912
START FRESH. AND THAT IS WHY I

02:55:55.978 --> 02:55:57.380
WILL RETURN TO PERHAPS THE MOST

02:55:57.446 --> 02:55:59.181
POWERFUL CEQA REFORM AND MOST

02:55:59.248 --> 02:56:01.117
SIMPLE SQL REFORM THAT WE COULD

02:56:01.183 --> 02:56:02.718
ENACT TO TAKE THIS OUT OF THE

02:56:02.785 --> 02:56:03.886
HANDS OF THE SPECIAL INTERESTS.

02:56:03.953 --> 02:56:05.821
BUT AT LEAST GIVE US SOME TIME,

02:56:05.888 --> 02:56:08.724
BUT ALSO GIVE RELIEF AND REDUCE

02:56:08.791 --> 02:56:10.660
COSTS. LET'S ELIMINATE PRIVATE

02:56:10.726 --> 02:56:13.796
RIGHT OF ACTION. LET'S MAKE SQL

02:56:13.863 --> 02:56:15.231
LAWSUITS FOR JUST FIVE YEARS.

02:56:15.298 --> 02:56:18.134
I'M JUST ASKING FOR FIVE YEARS.

02:56:18.200 --> 02:56:19.969
ONLY THE PURVIEW OF AN ELECTED

02:56:20.036 --> 02:56:22.171
DISTRICT ATTORNEY. AND IF YOU

02:56:22.238 --> 02:56:23.639
DON'T LIKE WHAT THE DISTRICT

02:56:23.706 --> 02:56:24.607
ATTORNEY IS DOING, IF YOU DON'T

02:56:24.674 --> 02:56:26.542
THINK THE DEA HAS DONE A GOOD

02:56:26.609 --> 02:56:28.444
ENOUGH JOB USING SQL TO STOP

02:56:28.511 --> 02:56:29.612
STOP BAD PROJECTS, OR THE

02:56:29.679 --> 02:56:30.546
DISTRICT ATTORNEY IS BOWING TO

02:56:30.613 --> 02:56:32.214
PUBLIC PRESSURE AND USING IT TOO

02:56:32.281 --> 02:56:33.349
MUCH AND IMPOSING TOO MANY

02:56:33.416 --> 02:56:34.917
REGULATORY COSTS ON HOUSING, YOU

02:56:34.984 --> 02:56:36.585
CAN AT LEAST BOOT THE DISTRICT

02:56:36.652 --> 02:56:37.653
ATTORNEY OUT OF OFFICE. YOU CAN

02:56:37.720 --> 02:56:39.322
HOLD THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY

02:56:39.388 --> 02:56:40.323
ACCOUNTABLE. THAT WOULD THEN

02:56:40.389 --> 02:56:43.426
GIVE US FIVE YEARS TO FIGURE OUT

02:56:43.492 --> 02:56:45.861
SOMETHING BETTER THAN SQL.

02:56:45.928 --> 02:56:47.396
AGAIN, I HOPE THAT SOME OF YOU

02:56:47.463 --> 02:56:48.965
MAY BE PERSUADED TO THINK ABOUT

02:56:49.031 --> 02:56:50.733
THIS. I DON'T I DON'T THINK IT'S

02:56:50.800 --> 02:56:52.368
A PARTIZAN IDEA. I THINK IT

02:56:52.435 --> 02:56:53.903
WOULD GIVE THAT BOOST. SOME OF

02:56:53.970 --> 02:56:56.339
YOU GAVE A FIVE YEAR REPRIEVE ON

02:56:56.405 --> 02:56:57.840
THE STATE BUILDING CODE, AND

02:56:57.907 --> 02:57:00.609
THAT'S AWESOME. 30S WISH THAT WE

02:57:00.676 --> 02:57:03.379
COULD ROLL A BUNCH OF THIS STUFF

02:57:03.446 --> 02:57:05.014
BACK IN THE STATE BUILDING CODE,

02:57:05.081 --> 02:57:06.682
PERHAPS TO 2010 OR 2005, BUT

02:57:06.749 --> 02:57:08.250
THIS IS PERHAPS SOMETHING THAT

02:57:08.317 --> 02:57:09.952
COULD GENERATE BIPARTISAN

02:57:10.019 --> 02:57:11.520
CONSENSUS IN THE NEXT YEAR. AND

02:57:11.587 --> 02:57:14.123
IT'S A IT'S A TEMPORARY FIX FOR

02:57:14.190 --> 02:57:15.524
WHAT IS A LONGER TERM CHALLENGE

02:57:15.591 --> 02:57:17.460
FOR US TO WRESTLE WITH. AGAIN,

02:57:17.526 --> 02:57:19.395
I'M GOING TO BE VOTING NO, BUT I

02:57:19.462 --> 02:57:21.130
DID WANT TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF

02:57:21.197 --> 02:57:22.331
SOME OF THE ELEMENTS IN THIS

02:57:22.398 --> 02:57:24.133
BILL AS IT RELATES TO SEQUEL

02:57:24.200 --> 02:57:25.167
REFORM, BECAUSE ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:57:25.234 --> 02:57:26.836
DEMAIO, ASSEMBLYMEMBER RUBIO,

02:57:26.902 --> 02:57:29.338
YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU,

02:57:29.405 --> 02:57:30.740
MR. SPEAKER. AND MEMBERS, I RISE

02:57:30.806 --> 02:57:34.210
TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB 130. THIS

02:57:34.276 --> 02:57:35.644
BILL IS CRITICAL FOR ADDRESSING

02:57:35.711 --> 02:57:37.680
SOME OF THE MOST PRESSING ISSUES

02:57:37.747 --> 02:57:38.848
IN OUR STATE. THE COST OF

02:57:38.914 --> 02:57:40.649
HOUSING DEVELOPMENT,

02:57:40.716 --> 02:57:41.751
MANUFACTURING AND

02:57:41.817 --> 02:57:43.252
TRANSPORTATION, AMONG OTHER

02:57:43.319 --> 02:57:45.321
THINGS. AB 130 IS THE NEXT STEP

02:57:45.388 --> 02:57:47.056
IN GIVING THE PEOPLE OF

02:57:47.123 --> 02:57:48.958
CALIFORNIA THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:57:49.025 --> 02:57:50.292
ACHIEVE THE AMERICAN DREAM THAT

02:57:50.359 --> 02:57:52.528
I SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER,

02:57:52.595 --> 02:57:54.997
ESPECIALLY OWNING A HOME. THE

02:57:55.064 --> 02:57:57.900
REALITY IS THAT THE REALITY IS

02:57:57.967 --> 02:57:59.735
CALIFORNIA HAS AMONG THE LOWEST

02:57:59.802 --> 02:58:00.736
HOMEOWNERSHIP RATES IN THE

02:58:00.803 --> 02:58:02.338
COUNTRY, DESPITE BEING THE

02:58:02.405 --> 02:58:03.706
FOURTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE

02:58:03.773 --> 02:58:05.841
WORLD. IF WE CONTINUE DOWN THE

02:58:05.908 --> 02:58:07.643
SAME PATH, WE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY

02:58:07.710 --> 02:58:10.312
FACE THE SAME CONSEQUENCES OVER

02:58:10.379 --> 02:58:12.014
AND OVER, LEAVING OUR

02:58:12.081 --> 02:58:13.416
COMMUNITIES TO DEAL WITH THEIR

02:58:13.482 --> 02:58:14.583
FRUSTRATION AND ANGER THEY

02:58:14.650 --> 02:58:15.551
ALREADY FEEL ABOUT THE LACK OF

02:58:15.618 --> 02:58:17.520
HOUSING PROSPECTS. WE ALL KNOW

02:58:17.586 --> 02:58:19.288
HOW IMPORTANT PROVIDING HOUSING

02:58:19.355 --> 02:58:20.890
IS TO US AND TO OUR

02:58:20.956 --> 02:58:22.491
CONSTITUENTS, AND HOW URGENT

02:58:22.558 --> 02:58:23.793
ADDRESSING THE HIGH COST OF

02:58:23.859 --> 02:58:25.361
LIVING IS. THIS BILL LOOKS TO

02:58:25.428 --> 02:58:27.129
ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS AND MEET

02:58:27.196 --> 02:58:28.564
THOSE GOALS BY PROVIDING A FEW

02:58:28.631 --> 02:58:30.800
KEY COMPONENTS NECESSARY TO

02:58:30.866 --> 02:58:32.868
QUICKLY AND SAFELY BUILD UP OUR

02:58:32.935 --> 02:58:34.737
CITIES. SOLVING THE ISSUE OF

02:58:34.804 --> 02:58:36.739
COST DELAY AND LACK OF ADEQUATE

02:58:36.806 --> 02:58:39.275
HOUSING SUPPLY. THANK YOU, MR.

02:58:39.341 --> 02:58:41.777
SPEAKER, AND I RESPECTFULLY

02:58:41.844 --> 02:58:43.712
REQUEST AN IBO TO AB 30. THANK

02:58:43.779 --> 02:58:46.148
YOU, ASSEMBLYMEMBER RUBIO.

02:58:46.215 --> 02:58:47.516
ASSEMBLYMEMBER HANEY, YOU ARE

02:58:47.583 --> 02:58:49.785
RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MR.

02:58:49.852 --> 02:58:51.587
SPEAKER. AND MEMBERS, I RISE TO

02:58:51.654 --> 02:58:54.824
SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB 130. I

02:58:54.890 --> 02:58:58.294
THINK YEARS FROM NOW, WHEN WE

02:58:58.360 --> 02:59:03.699
LOOK BACK ON WHAT HOPEFULLY IS

02:59:03.766 --> 02:59:06.335
CALIFORNIA FINALLY BEGINNING TO

02:59:06.402 --> 02:59:09.572
CONFRONT THIS HOUSING CRISIS

02:59:09.638 --> 02:59:12.641
THIS YEAR, 2025, AND THIS BILL

02:59:12.708 --> 02:59:13.876
WILL BE VIEWED AS A TURNING

02:59:13.943 --> 02:59:17.480
POINT. IF WE LOOK AT WHAT IS

02:59:17.546 --> 02:59:18.514
HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT

02:59:18.581 --> 02:59:21.016
NOW AND THE CHALLENGES THAT OUR

02:59:21.083 --> 02:59:22.318
RESIDENTS IN EVERY CORNER OF

02:59:22.384 --> 02:59:25.054
THIS STATE ARE FACING, TO BE

02:59:25.121 --> 02:59:27.690
ABLE TO OWN A HOME, TO BE ABLE

02:59:27.756 --> 02:59:30.192
TO RENT THE HIGHEST BURDEN FOR

02:59:30.259 --> 02:59:31.527
RENTERS, THE LOWEST

02:59:31.594 --> 02:59:34.029
HOMEOWNERSHIP RATE. WE ALL KNOW

02:59:34.096 --> 02:59:36.565
THAT A HUGE REASON FOR THAT IS

02:59:36.632 --> 02:59:38.300
BECAUSE IT TAKES LONGER AND IS

02:59:38.367 --> 02:59:40.870
MORE EXPENSIVE TO BUILD NEW

02:59:40.936 --> 02:59:42.705
HOMES IN CALIFORNIA THAN NEARLY

02:59:42.771 --> 02:59:44.540
ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE COUNTRY.

02:59:44.607 --> 02:59:47.710
AND WHY IS THAT? BECAUSE WE PUT

02:59:47.776 --> 02:59:51.280
STEP AFTER STEP, RED TAPE

02:59:51.347 --> 02:59:53.048
BUREAUCRACY, APPEAL AFTER

02:59:53.115 --> 02:59:55.551
APPEAL, AND A LEVEL OF

02:59:55.618 --> 02:59:57.019
UNPREDICTABILITY THAT IT JUST

02:59:57.086 --> 02:59:58.621
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR FOLKS TO

02:59:58.687 --> 02:59:59.889
INVEST IN HOME BUILDING THAT WE

02:59:59.955 --> 03:00:03.125
DESPERATELY NEED. THIS BILL WILL

03:00:03.192 --> 03:00:05.761
TAKE BOLDER, BIGGER STEPS TO

03:00:05.828 --> 03:00:07.229
MAKE SURE THAT WE ACTUALLY MAKE

03:00:07.296 --> 03:00:08.864
IT POSSIBLE TO BUILD HOMES IN

03:00:08.931 --> 03:00:11.834
OUR STATE WHERE THEY ARE NEEDED.

03:00:11.901 --> 03:00:13.235
INFILL DEVELOPMENT PLACES WHERE

03:00:13.302 --> 03:00:14.904
WE KNOW WE'RE NOT ONLY MEETING

03:00:14.970 --> 03:00:16.405
THE NEED FOR HOUSING, BUT ALSO

03:00:16.472 --> 03:00:17.473
WHERE IT'S ENVIRONMENTALLY

03:00:17.540 --> 03:00:19.275
SUSTAINABLE, WHERE IT'LL HELP US

03:00:19.341 --> 03:00:20.709
MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS, WHERE WE

03:00:20.776 --> 03:00:21.877
KNOW HOUSING BELONGS, WHERE

03:00:21.944 --> 03:00:23.846
WE'VE ALREADY APPROVED IT AS

03:00:23.913 --> 03:00:27.283
PART OF AN EIR WITHIN AN OVERALL

03:00:27.349 --> 03:00:30.419
PLAN. THIS WILL HELP IN WAYS

03:00:30.486 --> 03:00:32.555
THAT MAYBE RIGHT NOW WE ONLY CAN

03:00:32.621 --> 03:00:35.724
ONLY COMPREHEND. I HOPE TO BEGIN

03:00:35.791 --> 03:00:37.326
TO UNLEASH THE HOME BUILDING

03:00:37.393 --> 03:00:38.761
BOOM THAT WE NEED. WE ARE SHORT

03:00:38.827 --> 03:00:41.263
OVER 3 MILLION HOMES IN OUR

03:00:41.330 --> 03:00:43.365
STATE. OVER HALF A MILLION

03:00:43.432 --> 03:00:45.201
AFFORDABLE HOMES ARE NEEDED JUST

03:00:45.267 --> 03:00:46.535
IN THE COMING YEARS, AND WE'VE

03:00:46.602 --> 03:00:48.837
ALREADY PUT OUR CITIES AND

03:00:48.904 --> 03:00:50.306
COUNTIES ON THE HOOK TO BUILD

03:00:50.372 --> 03:00:53.242
THOSE. THIS IS A BUDGET AND A

03:00:53.309 --> 03:00:55.077
BILL THAT WILL CONFRONT THAT

03:00:55.144 --> 03:00:56.378
HOUSING CRISIS. I ALSO WANT TO

03:00:56.445 --> 03:00:58.914
SAY, AND OUR SPEAKER, DESERVE

03:00:58.981 --> 03:01:00.049
TREMENDOUS CREDIT FOR AT THE

03:01:00.115 --> 03:01:01.383
BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR, SAYING

03:01:01.450 --> 03:01:03.252
THAT THIS HOUSE, NOT ONLY

03:01:03.319 --> 03:01:04.553
DEMOCRATS, BUT REPUBLICANS, ALL

03:01:04.620 --> 03:01:07.323
OF US ARE GOING TO STAND UP FOR

03:01:07.389 --> 03:01:09.391
HOUSING AND SAY THAT THIS YEAR

03:01:09.458 --> 03:01:10.693
WE ARE GOING TO CONFRONT THE

03:01:10.759 --> 03:01:12.828
ISSUE THAT WE KNOW OUR

03:01:12.895 --> 03:01:14.230
CONSTITUENTS ARE EXPERIENCING

03:01:14.296 --> 03:01:16.599
AND DEMANDING US TO HELP TO

03:01:16.665 --> 03:01:18.734
ADDRESS. NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE A

03:01:18.801 --> 03:01:20.869
HUGE SECRET REFORM IN THIS BILL,

03:01:20.936 --> 03:01:23.005
WE ALSO, WHEN WE RECEIVE THE

03:01:23.072 --> 03:01:24.873
BUDGET THAT WAS GOING TO ZERO

03:01:24.940 --> 03:01:26.976
OUT FUNDING FOR THE LOW INCOME

03:01:27.042 --> 03:01:28.510
HOUSING TAX CREDIT, ZERO OUT

03:01:28.577 --> 03:01:29.878
FUNDING FOR HOMELESS DOLLARS

03:01:29.945 --> 03:01:31.046
THAT OUR CITIES AND COUNTIES

03:01:31.113 --> 03:01:32.748
NEED TO RESPOND TO THAT CRISIS.

03:01:32.815 --> 03:01:33.882
OUR BUDGET CHAIR, OUR SPEAKER,

03:01:33.949 --> 03:01:35.451
AND EVERY MEMBER OF THIS HOUSE

03:01:35.517 --> 03:01:37.820
SAID, NO WAY ARE WE VOTING FOR A

03:01:37.886 --> 03:01:39.521
BUDGET THAT WAS NOT GOING TO

03:01:39.588 --> 03:01:40.556
INVEST IN OUR MOST CRITICAL

03:01:40.623 --> 03:01:42.491
PRIORITY, WHICH IS MAKING SURE

03:01:42.558 --> 03:01:44.560
THAT EVERY SINGLE RESIDENT IN

03:01:44.627 --> 03:01:45.728
CALIFORNIA CAN HAVE A ROOF OVER

03:01:45.794 --> 03:01:47.162
THEIR HEADS? WE ARE CONFRONTING

03:01:47.229 --> 03:01:48.897
THAT IN THIS BUDGET. WE ARE

03:01:48.964 --> 03:01:50.466
CONFRONTING THAT IN THIS BILL

03:01:50.532 --> 03:01:52.568
FOR NOW AND FOR THE LONG TERM.

03:01:52.635 --> 03:01:53.936
WE ARE GOING TO SEE THE FRUITS

03:01:54.003 --> 03:01:55.537
OF THIS REFORM, I BELIEVE, FOR

03:01:55.604 --> 03:01:57.606
MANY YEARS TO COME. AND I WANT

03:01:57.673 --> 03:01:58.707
TO COMMEND AGAIN ALL OF MY

03:01:58.774 --> 03:02:00.743
COLLEAGUES AND ALSO MY OUR

03:02:00.809 --> 03:02:02.578
COLLEAGUE FROM FROM OAKLAND, WHO

03:02:02.645 --> 03:02:04.513
REALLY STEPPED UP TO PUT THIS

03:02:04.580 --> 03:02:05.781
FORWARD AND MADE SURE THAT IT

03:02:05.848 --> 03:02:07.650
WAS PUT INSIDE THE BUDGET. THIS

03:02:07.716 --> 03:02:09.418
IS A VERY PROUD MOMENT FOR US TO

03:02:09.485 --> 03:02:12.021
BE VOTING ON THIS BILL AND OUR

03:02:12.087 --> 03:02:13.522
CONSTITUENTS NOW AND FOR MANY,

03:02:13.589 --> 03:02:15.591
MANY YEARS IN THE FUTURE WILL

03:02:15.658 --> 03:02:17.793
SEE THE BENEFITS OF IT SO WE CAN

03:02:17.860 --> 03:02:19.662
CONFRONT THIS MOST CRITICAL

03:02:19.728 --> 03:02:21.363
CRISIS. AND WITH THAT,

03:02:21.430 --> 03:02:23.432
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

03:02:23.499 --> 03:02:24.967
ASSEMBLY MEMBER HAYNIE, ASSEMBLY

03:02:25.034 --> 03:02:26.669
MEMBER PATTERSON, YOU ARE

03:02:26.735 --> 03:02:28.470
RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MR.

03:02:28.537 --> 03:02:30.773
SPEAKER. JUST TO ELABORATE A

03:02:30.839 --> 03:02:32.474
LITTLE BIT ON WHAT MY COLLEAGUE

03:02:32.541 --> 03:02:34.710
FROM SAN FRANCISCO MENTIONED AND

03:02:34.777 --> 03:02:37.479
WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS HE

03:02:37.546 --> 03:02:40.349
MENTIONED THAT WE RECEIVED A

03:02:40.416 --> 03:02:42.217
BUDGET FROM THE GOVERNOR THAT

03:02:42.284 --> 03:02:45.054
ZEROED OUT, ZEROED OUT FUNDS.

03:02:45.120 --> 03:02:46.822
AND I JUST GOT TO SAY SOMETHING.

03:02:46.889 --> 03:02:48.624
LET'S MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T TAKE

03:02:48.691 --> 03:02:51.560
CREDIT FOR THIS, BECAUSE THE

03:02:51.627 --> 03:02:52.628
GOVERNOR SAID HE WASN'T GOING TO

03:02:52.695 --> 03:02:55.064
SIGN THE BUDGET WITHOUT HOUSING

03:02:55.130 --> 03:02:56.865
LEGISLATION. BUT LET'S NOT

03:02:56.932 --> 03:02:58.834
FORGET, AS WAS JUST MENTIONED,

03:02:58.901 --> 03:03:00.436
THAT HE PROPOSED A BUDGET TO

03:03:00.502 --> 03:03:03.105
THIS BODY THAT ZEROED OUT A LOT

03:03:03.172 --> 03:03:06.208
OF THE FUNDING THAT A LOT OF OUR

03:03:06.275 --> 03:03:07.443
LOCAL COMMUNITIES USE TO

03:03:07.509 --> 03:03:09.578
ACTUALLY BUILD HOUSING. SO I'M

03:03:09.645 --> 03:03:12.081
NOT GOING TO ALLOW HIM TO TAKE

03:03:12.147 --> 03:03:13.615
CREDIT FOR LIFTING A SINGLE

03:03:13.682 --> 03:03:15.117
FINGER WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING.

03:03:15.184 --> 03:03:17.553
THAT IS THE LEGISLATURE THAT HAS

03:03:17.619 --> 03:03:19.355
PUT TOGETHER THE WORK TO MAKE

03:03:19.421 --> 03:03:21.190
SURE HOUSING IS DONE IN

03:03:21.256 --> 03:03:22.624
CALIFORNIA. AND IT KIND OF

03:03:22.691 --> 03:03:24.993
BOTHERS ME THAT AT 11:59 P.M,

03:03:25.060 --> 03:03:26.829
THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA COMES

03:03:26.895 --> 03:03:28.697
FORWARD TO TRY TO TAKE CREDIT

03:03:28.764 --> 03:03:30.165
FOR ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS

03:03:30.232 --> 03:03:31.300
REGARDING HOUSING, WHEN REALLY

03:03:31.367 --> 03:03:33.936
HE HAD LITTLE TO DO WITH IT.

03:03:34.002 --> 03:03:35.838
SECONDLY, IF ANY REASON TO

03:03:35.904 --> 03:03:38.340
SUPPORT THIS BILL, IT REALLY HAS

03:03:38.407 --> 03:03:40.476
TO DO WITH PROVISION REGARDING

03:03:40.542 --> 03:03:44.580
HOA'S. AS YOU MAY KNOW, I'VE

03:03:44.646 --> 03:03:45.447
BEEN KIND OF WARRING WITH MINE

03:03:45.514 --> 03:03:47.449
FOR A WHILE, WHICH IS, YOU KNOW,

03:03:47.516 --> 03:03:49.752
KIND OF FUN FOR A LITTLE BIT

03:03:49.818 --> 03:03:50.753
BECAUSE MY SON, HE'S AN OUTLAW,

03:03:50.819 --> 03:03:51.854
HE KEEPS PUTTING HIS BASKETBALL

03:03:51.920 --> 03:03:53.956
HOOP ON OUR DRIVEWAY THAT THEY

03:03:54.022 --> 03:03:55.290
SHOULD SEND HIM TO PRISON.

03:03:55.357 --> 03:03:56.992
HONESTLY, IT'D BE CHEAPER FOR

03:03:57.059 --> 03:04:00.863
ME, BUT, BUT. AND THEY PROBABLY

03:04:00.929 --> 03:04:02.731
WOULD IF THEY COULD IF THAT WAS

03:04:02.798 --> 03:04:05.000
IN THE. BUT BUT I THINK IT'S

03:04:05.067 --> 03:04:07.469
REALLY IMPORTANT WE HAVE WE HAVE

03:04:07.536 --> 03:04:10.539
HOA'S THAT ARE OUT THERE SAYING

03:04:10.606 --> 03:04:12.541
WHAT YOU CAN AND CAN'T DO ON

03:04:12.608 --> 03:04:14.009
PUBLIC RIGHTS, OF RIGHT, OF

03:04:14.076 --> 03:04:15.844
WAYS. AND THEN IF YOU DON'T DO

03:04:15.911 --> 03:04:18.180
WHAT THEY SAY THAT THEY WANT YOU

03:04:18.247 --> 03:04:21.116
TO DO ON A PUBLICLY FUNDED

03:04:21.183 --> 03:04:23.118
TAXPAYER STREET, THAT THEY WILL

03:04:23.185 --> 03:04:25.487
THEN FINE YOU. AND I JUST THINK

03:04:25.554 --> 03:04:27.389
THAT THAT IS WRONG, AND HOA

03:04:27.456 --> 03:04:29.591
SHOULD NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO

03:04:29.658 --> 03:04:32.261
DICTATE WHAT HAPPENS ON TAXPAYER

03:04:32.327 --> 03:04:34.329
FUNDED PROPERTY. THEY CAN ASK

03:04:34.396 --> 03:04:36.064
YOU, I GUESS, TO LOOK INTO YOUR

03:04:36.131 --> 03:04:37.466
GARAGE ALL THEY WANT OR LOOK

03:04:37.533 --> 03:04:39.201
INTO YOUR BACKYARD. BUT TO THE

03:04:39.268 --> 03:04:41.236
EXTENT THAT THEY'RE SAYING WHAT

03:04:41.303 --> 03:04:43.172
CAN HAPPEN TO TAXPAYERS IS

03:04:43.238 --> 03:04:45.374
OFFENSIVE. AND NOW I WANT TO SAY

03:04:45.441 --> 03:04:47.543
SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS A BIG

03:04:47.609 --> 03:04:48.377
PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL AND I

03:04:48.444 --> 03:04:50.446
THINK IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE

03:04:50.512 --> 03:04:52.548
ADDRESSED. I AM GOING TO SUPPORT

03:04:52.614 --> 03:04:53.549
THIS MEASURE BECAUSE I THINK THE

03:04:53.615 --> 03:04:55.517
PROS OUTWEIGH THE CONS. THERE'S

03:04:55.584 --> 03:04:57.853
A LOT OF GOOD THINGS TO GET SOME

03:04:57.920 --> 03:04:58.654
HOUSING DONE, BUT THE VMT BANK

03:04:58.720 --> 03:04:59.855
IS A PROBLEM. I ALWAYS THOUGHT

03:04:59.922 --> 03:05:02.124
IT WAS INTERESTING WHEN I WAS

03:05:02.191 --> 03:05:02.691
APPROVING PROJECTS ON THE

03:05:02.758 --> 03:05:04.460
OAKLAND CITY COUNCIL, WHEN WE

03:05:04.526 --> 03:05:06.962
STARTED TRANSITIONING TO HAVING

03:05:07.029 --> 03:05:09.531
TO CALCULATE VMT, THE MAJORITY.

03:05:09.598 --> 03:05:10.899
A LOT OF THE COMMUNITIES

03:05:10.966 --> 03:05:12.000
BUILDING HOUSING. PLACER COUNTY

03:05:12.067 --> 03:05:13.602
IS ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING

03:05:13.669 --> 03:05:15.504
COUNTIES IN THE STATE, ONE OF

03:05:15.571 --> 03:05:18.807
THEM FOR MANY YEARS. YOU CAN'T

03:05:18.874 --> 03:05:21.677
REDUCE VMT AND BUILD HOUSING

03:05:21.743 --> 03:05:23.545
UNLESS YOU'RE IN AN URBAN CORE

03:05:23.612 --> 03:05:25.047
AREA. IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE TO

03:05:25.113 --> 03:05:28.617
DO. AND A LOT OF THOSE AREAS

03:05:28.684 --> 03:05:30.452
THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE ROOM TO

03:05:30.519 --> 03:05:33.188
GROW DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY

03:05:33.255 --> 03:05:34.957
UNLESS THE STATE WANTS TO START

03:05:35.023 --> 03:05:37.292
FUNDING TRANSIT SYSTEMS

03:05:37.359 --> 03:05:38.894
THROUGHOUT OUR DISTRICTS. IT'S

03:05:38.961 --> 03:05:41.096
JUST NOT POSSIBLE TO REDUCE VMT.

03:05:41.163 --> 03:05:42.598
MOST PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN A

03:05:42.664 --> 03:05:44.900
COMMUNITY LIKE MINE EITHER WORK

03:05:44.967 --> 03:05:46.335
FROM HOME, WHICH IS GREAT, OR

03:05:46.401 --> 03:05:48.070
THEY'RE COMMUTING TO A PLACE

03:05:48.136 --> 03:05:48.937
LIKE SACRAMENTO. YOU'RE NOT

03:05:49.004 --> 03:05:51.273
GOING TO BE REDUCING VMT AND

03:05:51.340 --> 03:05:52.541
CREATING A BANK. YOU MIGHT SAY,

03:05:52.608 --> 03:05:54.576
HEY, WELL, THIS IS GOING TO HELP

03:05:54.643 --> 03:05:56.979
THEM DO THINGS THAT CAN REDUCE

03:05:57.045 --> 03:05:58.780
VMT. WELL, REALLY WHAT'S JUST

03:05:58.847 --> 03:06:00.916
GOING TO HAPPEN IS YOU'RE GOING

03:06:00.983 --> 03:06:03.118
TO ASK FOR MONEY FROM THE

03:06:03.185 --> 03:06:04.520
DEVELOPER, WHICH BY THE WAY, IS

03:06:04.586 --> 03:06:08.257
GOING TO BE PAID FOR BY THE

03:06:08.323 --> 03:06:10.158
PEOPLE LIVING THERE. AT THE END

03:06:10.225 --> 03:06:11.026
OF THE DAY, WHETHER THAT'S

03:06:11.093 --> 03:06:13.161
THROUGH RENT OR OWNERSHIP TO PAY

03:06:13.228 --> 03:06:14.630
FOR THE TRANSIT SYSTEMS. AND SO

03:06:14.696 --> 03:06:15.931
IT'S JUST GOING TO INCREASE THE

03:06:15.998 --> 03:06:20.135
COST OF HOUSING FOR A PROJECT

03:06:20.202 --> 03:06:22.571
THAT IS JUST NOT GOING TO BE

03:06:22.638 --> 03:06:24.439
POSSIBLE TO REDUCE VMT. AND IT'S

03:06:24.506 --> 03:06:25.440
REALLY INTERESTING LOOKING AT

03:06:25.507 --> 03:06:27.709
CITY STAFF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

03:06:27.776 --> 03:06:30.379
HOW TO MAKE EVERY PROJECT PENCIL

03:06:30.445 --> 03:06:32.347
LOOKING LIKE IT'S REDUCING VMT

03:06:32.414 --> 03:06:34.917
WHEN YOU JUST PUT UP 1000 UNITS,

03:06:34.983 --> 03:06:37.219
YOU KNOW, 50 MILES FROM THE

03:06:37.286 --> 03:06:40.856
NEAREST URBAN CENTER. 30S. SO I

03:06:40.923 --> 03:06:42.291
THINK THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM

03:06:42.357 --> 03:06:43.625
THAT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE

03:06:43.692 --> 03:06:45.494
ADDRESSED IN THE NEAR FUTURE,

03:06:45.561 --> 03:06:48.063
BUT I'M WILLING TO SUPPORT THE

03:06:48.130 --> 03:06:50.999
LEGISLATURE'S WORK ON GETTING

03:06:51.066 --> 03:06:53.602
HOUSING DONE IN THIS STATE. AND

03:06:53.669 --> 03:06:55.237
WITH THAT, I ASK FOR AN AYE

03:06:55.304 --> 03:06:59.575
VOTE. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

03:06:59.641 --> 03:07:00.108
PATTERSON, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

03:07:00.175 --> 03:07:02.878
ALVAREZ, YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

03:07:02.945 --> 03:07:04.580
THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. AND

03:07:04.646 --> 03:07:06.448
COLLEAGUES, I RISE IN SUPPORT OF

03:07:06.515 --> 03:07:09.518
ASSEMBLY BILL 130, AND I WANT TO

03:07:09.585 --> 03:07:11.186
THANK ALL THOSE WHO HAVE SPOKEN

03:07:11.253 --> 03:07:12.554
ALREADY ON BEHALF OF THIS

03:07:12.621 --> 03:07:15.090
MEASURE. SOME OF US HAVE REALLY

03:07:15.157 --> 03:07:16.592
TAKEN IT UPON OURSELVES TO TRY

03:07:16.658 --> 03:07:18.226
AND FOCUS AND WORK ON THE

03:07:18.293 --> 03:07:20.329
HOUSING ISSUE, AS IT IS CRITICAL

03:07:20.395 --> 03:07:21.997
FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE.

03:07:22.064 --> 03:07:23.865
IT'S CRITICAL FOR THE FUTURE

03:07:23.932 --> 03:07:24.600
GENERATIONS, THOSE OF US WITH

03:07:24.666 --> 03:07:25.901
CHILDREN WHO WANT OUR CHILDREN

03:07:25.968 --> 03:07:28.170
TO LIVE IN THIS STATE. I REALLY

03:07:28.236 --> 03:07:29.805
FEEL VERY, VERY CONNECTED TO

03:07:29.871 --> 03:07:32.074
THIS ISSUE. AND SO AS A

03:07:32.140 --> 03:07:33.875
LEGISLATOR, I HAVE ATTEMPTED ON

03:07:33.942 --> 03:07:35.978
A FEW OCCASIONS TO TRY TO MAKE

03:07:36.044 --> 03:07:37.312
CHANGE WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING

03:07:37.379 --> 03:07:39.648
AND TRY TO MAKE THINGS EASIER TO

03:07:39.715 --> 03:07:40.649
BUILD HOUSING, TRY TO MAKE

03:07:40.716 --> 03:07:42.317
THINGS SO THAT WE COULD HAVE

03:07:42.384 --> 03:07:44.152
MORE HOUSING FOR THE FUTURE. I

03:07:44.219 --> 03:07:46.555
STAND TODAY AND SAY THAT I THINK

03:07:46.622 --> 03:07:47.623
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST

03:07:47.689 --> 03:07:49.691
CONSEQUENTIAL THINGS I WILL HAVE

03:07:49.758 --> 03:07:51.460
DONE TO DATE. WHEN I CAST MY

03:07:51.526 --> 03:07:53.128
VOTE IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL

03:07:53.195 --> 03:07:55.397
130. IT'S ONE OF THE MOST

03:07:55.464 --> 03:07:57.466
CONSEQUENTIAL THINGS WE CAN DO

03:07:57.532 --> 03:07:59.801
TO ENSURE THAT ONE OF THE

03:07:59.868 --> 03:08:01.103
COMPONENTS OF HOUSING, BECAUSE

03:08:01.169 --> 03:08:02.471
THERE ARE MULTIPLE COMPONENTS,

03:08:02.537 --> 03:08:05.674
WE HAVE TO STABILIZE THE MARKET.

03:08:05.741 --> 03:08:07.242
WE DO THAT OFTEN THROUGH THINGS

03:08:07.309 --> 03:08:09.478
LIKE MEASURES WE'VE TAKEN IN THE

03:08:09.544 --> 03:08:11.079
PAST IN THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE

03:08:11.146 --> 03:08:13.081
SURE THAT TENANTS ARE PROTECTED.

03:08:13.148 --> 03:08:15.350
WE NEED TO SUBSIDIZE HOUSING,

03:08:15.417 --> 03:08:16.685
WHICH WE HAVE DONE IN THIS

03:08:16.752 --> 03:08:19.187
YEAR'S BUDGET THANKS TO THE WORK

03:08:19.254 --> 03:08:19.888
OF THIS LEGISLATURE, AS WAS

03:08:19.955 --> 03:08:21.923
SHARED EARLIER FROM OUR

03:08:21.990 --> 03:08:22.557
COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO.

03:08:22.624 --> 03:08:24.326
AND WE SHOULD ALSO FOCUS ON

03:08:24.393 --> 03:08:26.428
SUPPLY, MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE

03:08:26.495 --> 03:08:28.263
HOUSING FOR THE NUMBER OF

03:08:28.330 --> 03:08:29.998
CALIFORNIANS THAT ARE IN OUR

03:08:30.065 --> 03:08:32.100
STATE. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS

03:08:32.167 --> 03:08:32.901
ABOUT. IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE

03:08:32.968 --> 03:08:35.070
THAT ONE OF THOSE THREE VERY

03:08:35.137 --> 03:08:36.905
IMPORTANT COMPONENTS OF HOUSING

03:08:36.972 --> 03:08:39.341
IS ADDRESSED. AND SOME OF US

03:08:39.408 --> 03:08:40.308
HAVE ATTEMPTED, I'LL INCLUDE

03:08:40.375 --> 03:08:41.510
MYSELF THROUGHOUT THE LAST

03:08:41.576 --> 03:08:42.944
COUPLE OF YEARS TO REALLY TRY TO

03:08:43.011 --> 03:08:44.680
GET TO THIS ISSUE OF ALLOWING

03:08:44.746 --> 03:08:45.981
IT, MAKING IT EASIER TO BUILD

03:08:46.048 --> 03:08:47.716
MORE HOUSING BECAUSE IT IS TOO

03:08:47.783 --> 03:08:50.152
COMPLICATED, IT IS TOO COSTLY,

03:08:50.218 --> 03:08:51.920
AND WE'VE HAD SOME MINOR

03:08:51.987 --> 03:08:53.422
SUCCESSES. I FEEL THAT I'VE HAD

03:08:53.488 --> 03:08:55.257
A FEW SUCCESSES WHEN IT CAME TO

03:08:55.323 --> 03:08:56.625
OUR CEQA EXEMPTIONS ON

03:08:56.692 --> 03:08:57.726
AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT WE

03:08:57.793 --> 03:08:58.860
PASSED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO,

03:08:58.927 --> 03:09:00.529
THANKS TO THE SUPPORT OF THE

03:09:00.595 --> 03:09:02.164
LEGISLATURE. BUT IT DIDN'T COME

03:09:02.230 --> 03:09:04.099
CLOSE TO WHAT THIS BILL IS GOING

03:09:04.166 --> 03:09:05.901
TO ACCOMPLISH. AND YES, IT

03:09:05.967 --> 03:09:07.402
INCLUDES AND MAKES SURE THAT

03:09:07.469 --> 03:09:09.905
PEOPLE GET PAID WAGES THAT ARE

03:09:09.971 --> 03:09:12.107
APPROPRIATE. AND THAT'S OKAY,

03:09:12.174 --> 03:09:12.874
BECAUSE IN CALIFORNIA, WE

03:09:12.941 --> 03:09:14.242
BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE

03:09:14.309 --> 03:09:15.510
COMPENSATED FOR THE WORK THAT

03:09:15.577 --> 03:09:18.980
THEY DO. AND SO THIS BILL

03:09:19.047 --> 03:09:21.483
OVERALL, I THINK, MOVES THE BALL

03:09:21.550 --> 03:09:23.151
FORWARD SIGNIFICANTLY. IT IS

03:09:23.218 --> 03:09:25.320
GOING TO BE, AS I'VE SAID

03:09:25.387 --> 03:09:26.488
ALREADY, CONSEQUENTIAL. IT'S

03:09:26.555 --> 03:09:29.191
GOING TO CREATE REAL CHANGE FOR

03:09:29.257 --> 03:09:31.359
THE SUPPLY SIDE OF HOUSING TO

03:09:31.426 --> 03:09:33.662
BUILD THE HOUSING THAT WE WANT

03:09:33.729 --> 03:09:34.896
TO SEE, BUILD THE HOUSING THAT

03:09:34.963 --> 03:09:36.298
WE NEED. AND FOR THAT REASON, I

03:09:36.364 --> 03:09:38.100
WANT TO THANK CERTAINLY OUR

03:09:38.166 --> 03:09:39.501
COLLEAGUE FROM OAKLAND WHO BEGAN

03:09:39.568 --> 03:09:41.036
THIS CONVERSATION THROUGH THE

03:09:41.103 --> 03:09:43.371
COMMITTEE PROCESS, CERTAINLY TO

03:09:43.438 --> 03:09:45.040
OUR SPEAKER WHO MADE THIS A

03:09:45.107 --> 03:09:47.008
PRIORITY AND NOT ONLY MADE IT A

03:09:47.075 --> 03:09:48.143
PRIORITY THROUGH WORDS, BUT

03:09:48.210 --> 03:09:49.244
THROUGH ACTIONS, AGAIN, THROUGH

03:09:49.311 --> 03:09:51.313
OUR BUDGET AND THROUGH THIS BILL

03:09:51.379 --> 03:09:53.215
TODAY, AND TO OTHERS WHO HAVE

03:09:53.281 --> 03:09:55.250
STEPPED UP AND PUSHED AND MAKE

03:09:55.317 --> 03:09:56.785
US MAKE SURE WE'RE MAKING

03:09:56.852 --> 03:09:57.886
DIFFICULT DECISIONS WHEN IT

03:09:57.953 --> 03:09:59.554
COMES TO THIS. AND YOU KNOW

03:09:59.621 --> 03:10:01.423
WHAT? IF IT TAKES THE CHAIR OF

03:10:01.490 --> 03:10:02.591
APPROPRIATIONS TO MAKE ACTUAL,

03:10:02.657 --> 03:10:03.458
REAL, MEANINGFUL CHANGE IN

03:10:03.525 --> 03:10:04.726
HOUSING POLICY, THEN I'LL TAKE

03:10:04.793 --> 03:10:06.928
IT. THAT'S A WIN FOR ALL OF US.

03:10:06.995 --> 03:10:09.364
SOME OF US DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY

03:10:09.431 --> 03:10:10.732
OF BEING ABLE TO PUSH THAT HARD.

03:10:10.799 --> 03:10:13.101
AND THOSE OF US THAT DO NEED TO

03:10:13.168 --> 03:10:14.703
STEP UP AND SPEAK UP AND PUSH US

03:10:14.770 --> 03:10:16.171
TO DO BETTER, THAT'S WHAT THIS

03:10:16.238 --> 03:10:17.739
BILL DOES. AND THAT'S WHY I

03:10:17.806 --> 03:10:19.508
STAND IN SUPPORT AND I ASK FOR

03:10:19.574 --> 03:10:21.343
AYE VOTE. THANK YOU, MR.

03:10:21.409 --> 03:10:21.943
SPEAKER. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

03:10:22.010 --> 03:10:24.079
MEMBER ALVAREZ WIENER GALLAGHER,

03:10:24.146 --> 03:10:27.282
YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. YEAH. THANK

03:10:27.349 --> 03:10:31.219
YOU, MR. SPEAKER. AND MEMBERS.

03:10:31.286 --> 03:10:32.387
WHAT A DIFFERENCE TEN YEARS

03:10:32.454 --> 03:10:36.158
MAKES. YOU KNOW, WHEN I STARTED

03:10:36.224 --> 03:10:39.194
OFF AS A FRESHMAN LEGISLATOR,

03:10:39.261 --> 03:10:42.864
TEN YEARS AGO IN 2015, THE

03:10:42.931 --> 03:10:45.300
REPUBLICAN CAUCUS INTRODUCED

03:10:45.367 --> 03:10:48.804
SEVERAL CEQA REFORM BILLS. WE

03:10:48.870 --> 03:10:51.173
INTRODUCED A SCHOOL REFORM BILL

03:10:51.239 --> 03:10:54.776
ON WILDFIRE. WE INTRODUCED A

03:10:54.843 --> 03:10:58.180
SCHOOL REFORM BILL ON WATER

03:10:58.246 --> 03:11:00.315
STORAGE AND WATER INFRASTRUCTURE

03:11:00.382 --> 03:11:02.484
IN THE STATE. AND WE INTRODUCED

03:11:02.551 --> 03:11:07.656
A REFORM BILL ON HOUSING. AND

03:11:07.722 --> 03:11:10.826
BACK IN THOSE DAYS, IN 2015,

03:11:10.892 --> 03:11:12.694
THOSE BILLS DIDN'T EVEN MAKE IT

03:11:12.761 --> 03:11:16.298
OUT OF COMMITTEE. THERE WAS A

03:11:16.364 --> 03:11:20.202
VERY STRONG INTEREST THAT KEPT

03:11:20.268 --> 03:11:21.336
THOSE THINGS FROM GETTING

03:11:21.403 --> 03:11:23.905
ANYWHERE. THE PHILOSOPHY WAS

03:11:23.972 --> 03:11:26.641
THAT SEQUA WAS SACROSANCT AND

03:11:26.708 --> 03:11:28.476
YOU DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING ABOUT

03:11:28.543 --> 03:11:32.814
IT. THOSE BILLS DIED. THEY GOT

03:11:32.881 --> 03:11:36.451
NOWHERE. TEN YEARS LATER, WHAT

03:11:36.518 --> 03:11:37.886
HAVE WE DONE THIS YEAR? WE

03:11:37.953 --> 03:11:40.822
PASSED CEQA REFORM ON WILDFIRE.

03:11:40.889 --> 03:11:43.258
WE PASSED SECRET REFORM ON WATER

03:11:43.325 --> 03:11:44.893
INFRASTRUCTURE A COUPLE OF YEARS

03:11:44.960 --> 03:11:47.596
AGO. AND NOW TODAY WE'RE PASSING

03:11:47.662 --> 03:11:50.165
SEQUEL REFORM, SUBSTANTIAL CEQA

03:11:50.232 --> 03:11:52.934
REFORM ON HOUSING. AND YES, I

03:11:53.001 --> 03:11:54.803
THINK THE REPUBLICANS DESERVE

03:11:54.870 --> 03:11:56.705
QUITE A BIT OF CREDIT FOR THAT.

03:11:56.771 --> 03:11:57.539
WE'VE BEEN SAYING THAT FOR TEN

03:11:57.606 --> 03:11:59.441
YEARS. WE'VE BEEN PUSHING FOR

03:11:59.507 --> 03:12:00.642
THAT. WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIND

03:12:00.709 --> 03:12:02.777
PARTNERS, AND WE HAVE. AND ONE

03:12:02.844 --> 03:12:04.246
OF THE GREATEST ONES HAS BEEN

03:12:04.312 --> 03:12:06.248
THE GENTLEWOMAN FROM OAKLAND.

03:12:06.314 --> 03:12:07.816
YOU KNOW, WHO FROM DAY ONE, WHEN

03:12:07.883 --> 03:12:09.985
SHE CAME IN AND SAID, WE NEED TO

03:12:10.051 --> 03:12:11.653
DO SOMETHING ON HOUSING, WE NEED

03:12:11.720 --> 03:12:13.255
TO REMOVE THESE BARRIERS. CEQA

03:12:13.321 --> 03:12:15.624
IS AN IMPEDIMENT AND WE CAN DO

03:12:15.690 --> 03:12:18.627
BETTER. AND IT BECAME A VERY

03:12:18.693 --> 03:12:21.496
BIPARTISAN GROUP THAT BEGAN TO

03:12:21.563 --> 03:12:23.231
PUSH THOSE THINGS. AND OVER THE

03:12:23.298 --> 03:12:24.566
LAST FIVE YEARS, I WOULD SAY

03:12:24.633 --> 03:12:29.337
WE'VE WE'VE MADE SOME INROADS.

03:12:29.404 --> 03:12:30.739
BUT TODAY I THINK WE HAVE

03:12:30.805 --> 03:12:32.674
SOMETHING THAT IS A VERY BIG

03:12:32.741 --> 03:12:34.442
MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THAT

03:12:34.509 --> 03:12:36.511
IS ACTUALLY GOING TO HELP

03:12:36.578 --> 03:12:38.346
HOUSING. AND I THINK THE CREDIT

03:12:38.413 --> 03:12:42.183
ALSO BELONGS TO THE LEGISLATURE,

03:12:42.250 --> 03:12:43.685
BECAUSE IT'S THE LEGISLATURE

03:12:43.752 --> 03:12:44.853
THAT HAS BEEN WORKING ON THESE

03:12:44.920 --> 03:12:47.355
ISSUES. IT'S BEEN DOING THE HARD

03:12:47.422 --> 03:12:50.158
WORK THAT'S BEEN LOOKING INTO

03:12:50.225 --> 03:12:52.127
THESE ISSUES. THAT'S BEEN

03:12:52.193 --> 03:12:53.128
STANDING UP AGAINST THE INTEREST

03:12:53.194 --> 03:12:54.896
GROUPS THAT PUSH BACK AND DON'T

03:12:54.963 --> 03:12:57.432
WANT ANY CHANGES TO SEQUA. YOU

03:12:57.499 --> 03:12:58.600
KNOW, WE HEARD SOME OF THAT

03:12:58.667 --> 03:13:00.402
EARLIER ON THE FLOOR. THAT'S THE

03:13:00.468 --> 03:13:01.703
PROBLEM. YOU WON'T GET ANYWHERE

03:13:01.770 --> 03:13:03.204
IF YOU KEEP WITH THAT

03:13:03.271 --> 03:13:04.839
PHILOSOPHY. BUT WE HAVEN'T. AND

03:13:04.906 --> 03:13:05.874
THE LEGISLATURE HAS COME

03:13:05.941 --> 03:13:06.708
TOGETHER TO DO THAT. THE

03:13:06.775 --> 03:13:09.244
GOVERNOR HAS DONE VERY LITTLE

03:13:09.311 --> 03:13:12.480
EXCEPT TALK, EXCEPT POINT

03:13:12.547 --> 03:13:14.783
FINGERS, EXCEPT NOT KEEP

03:13:14.849 --> 03:13:16.584
PROMISES THAT HE MADE. YOU KNOW,

03:13:16.651 --> 03:13:17.585
WHEN HE CAME INTO OFFICE, HE

03:13:17.652 --> 03:13:18.687
SAID HE'S GOING TO BUILD

03:13:18.753 --> 03:13:20.522
MILLIONS OF NEW UNITS OF

03:13:20.588 --> 03:13:21.823
HOUSING. AND OF COURSE, THAT

03:13:21.890 --> 03:13:24.092
DIDN'T HAPPEN. AND NOW WHEN HE'S

03:13:24.159 --> 03:13:26.962
GONE ON HIS WAY OUT, HE REALIZES

03:13:27.028 --> 03:13:28.363
THAT HE HASN'T GOTTEN REALLY

03:13:28.430 --> 03:13:30.198
MUCH DONE ON HOUSING. HIS RECORD

03:13:30.265 --> 03:13:32.567
IS NOT VERY GOOD AND EVERYBODY

03:13:32.634 --> 03:13:36.237
KNOWS IT. SO NOW HE WANTS TO

03:13:36.304 --> 03:13:41.109
TAKE CREDIT FOR OUR WORK. WHICH,

03:13:41.176 --> 03:13:42.510
BY THE WAY, THIS IS THE BILL

03:13:42.577 --> 03:13:43.945
THAT DOES SOMETHING ON HOUSING

03:13:44.012 --> 03:13:46.147
REALLY. I MEAN, TO ME, THIS IS

03:13:46.214 --> 03:13:47.115
THE LEGISLATION THAT ACTUALLY

03:13:47.182 --> 03:13:48.283
MOVES THE BALL ON HOUSING. BUT

03:13:48.350 --> 03:13:51.286
HE WAS MAKING IT ALL ABOUT 131

03:13:51.353 --> 03:13:55.357
GUYS CONFUSED, YOU KNOW. IF WE

03:13:55.423 --> 03:13:57.525
WANT TO MOVE THE BALL, WE HAVE

03:13:57.592 --> 03:13:59.527
TO REMOVE BARRIERS ON HOUSING.

03:13:59.594 --> 03:14:00.795
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS THIS BILL I

03:14:00.862 --> 03:14:02.831
THINK DOES NOW IT'S NOT PERFECT.

03:14:02.897 --> 03:14:04.466
AND PEOPLE HAVE POINTED OUT THE

03:14:04.532 --> 03:14:06.267
DIFFERENT ISSUES THAT HAVE COME

03:14:06.334 --> 03:14:07.268
UP. I MEAN, NO PIECE OF

03:14:07.335 --> 03:14:09.170
LEGISLATION IS I THINK THE VMT

03:14:09.237 --> 03:14:11.072
ISSUE IS AN ISSUE. IT IS GOING

03:14:11.139 --> 03:14:14.642
TO BE COSTLY TO MEET THAT, YOU

03:14:14.709 --> 03:14:15.577
KNOW, AS IT'S CURRENTLY WRITTEN.

03:14:15.643 --> 03:14:17.779
BUT I THINK WE CAN FIX THAT. YOU

03:14:17.846 --> 03:14:18.780
KNOW, THERE'S DISCUSSION ABOUT

03:14:18.847 --> 03:14:20.248
THE TRIBAL CONSULTATION ISSUES.

03:14:20.315 --> 03:14:21.750
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AS

03:14:21.816 --> 03:14:24.586
WELL. I THINK WE CAN FIX THAT.

03:14:24.652 --> 03:14:25.353
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT SHOULD

03:14:25.420 --> 03:14:28.957
STOP US FROM SUPPORTING REALLY

03:14:29.024 --> 03:14:30.592
INSTRUMENTAL VEHICLE REFORM ON

03:14:30.658 --> 03:14:32.861
HOUSING TODAY THAT WE DID THAT

03:14:32.927 --> 03:14:34.629
WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ACTUALLY

03:14:34.696 --> 03:14:37.532
PUSHING AND MAKING HAPPEN. AND

03:14:37.599 --> 03:14:38.867
DON'T LET ANYBODY ELSE TAKE

03:14:38.933 --> 03:14:40.769
CREDIT FOR THAT. 30S BECAUSE

03:14:40.835 --> 03:14:44.873
THEY DID VERY LITTLE GAVIN

03:14:44.939 --> 03:14:49.377
NEWSOM. AND I'M REALLY TIRED OF

03:14:49.444 --> 03:14:52.680
THE SUGGESTION THAT HE HAS TO

03:14:52.747 --> 03:14:54.416
PUSH US TO DO SOMETHING WHEN

03:14:54.482 --> 03:14:55.650
WE'VE BEEN THE ONES WHO'VE

03:14:55.717 --> 03:14:56.918
ACTUALLY BEEN DOING THE WORK ON

03:14:56.985 --> 03:14:59.421
A LOT OF THESE ISSUES FOR A LONG

03:14:59.487 --> 03:15:00.889
TIME, AND ESPECIALLY

03:15:00.955 --> 03:15:02.724
REPUBLICANS. IT'S PRETTY LAZY,

03:15:02.791 --> 03:15:04.926
ACTUALLY. ON BEHALF OF THE

03:15:04.993 --> 03:15:06.928
GOVERNOR, HE'S A LAZY GOVERNOR.

03:15:06.995 --> 03:15:09.030
HE HASN'T FOLLOWED IN, FOLLOWED

03:15:09.097 --> 03:15:10.965
UP ON ANY OF THE THINGS THAT HE

03:15:11.032 --> 03:15:13.234
SAID HE WAS GOING TO DO. BUT WE

03:15:13.301 --> 03:15:15.070
AS REPUBLICANS, WE HAVE IT'S

03:15:15.136 --> 03:15:16.871
BEEN A LONG TIME. IT'S BEEN TEN

03:15:16.938 --> 03:15:18.206
YEARS. IT'S BEEN A LOT OF

03:15:18.273 --> 03:15:20.308
TURMOIL. BUT TODAY, YEAH, WE GOT

03:15:20.375 --> 03:15:22.043
IT DONE. WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE

03:15:22.110 --> 03:15:23.445
TO GET IT DONE, AND WE'RE GOING

03:15:23.511 --> 03:15:24.846
TO PUSH FOR REAL REFORMS THAT

03:15:24.913 --> 03:15:27.215
BRING RESULTS TO THE PEOPLE OF

03:15:27.282 --> 03:15:29.651
CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. THANK

03:15:29.717 --> 03:15:31.920
YOU, LEADER GALLAGHER, ASSEMBLY

03:15:31.986 --> 03:15:32.687
MEMBER BRIAN, YOU ARE

03:15:32.754 --> 03:15:35.056
RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MR.

03:15:35.123 --> 03:15:37.325
SPEAKER. AND COLLEAGUES, I RISE

03:15:37.392 --> 03:15:39.794
IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. YOU

03:15:39.861 --> 03:15:40.895
KNOW THAT PERSON ON THE GROUP

03:15:40.962 --> 03:15:42.430
PROJECT WHO DOESN'T DO ANYTHING

03:15:42.497 --> 03:15:45.533
BUT THEN TAKES CREDIT FOR IT? ME

03:15:45.600 --> 03:15:49.637
TOO. DOING THE HARD THINGS IS

03:15:49.704 --> 03:15:54.142
NOT EASY. POLICY MAKING IS NOT

03:15:54.209 --> 03:15:57.812
EASY. CEQA ISN'T A PROBLEM.

03:15:57.879 --> 03:16:00.648
ABUSING CEQA IS THE PROBLEM. I

03:16:00.715 --> 03:16:01.916
COME FROM A COMMUNITY. MANY OF

03:16:01.983 --> 03:16:03.852
YOU COME FROM COMMUNITIES THAT

03:16:03.918 --> 03:16:05.053
ARE REFERRED TO AS SACRIFICE

03:16:05.120 --> 03:16:06.754
ZONES. IT'S WHERE FREEWAYS

03:16:06.821 --> 03:16:08.223
SPLIT. IT'S WHERE ENVIRONMENTAL

03:16:08.289 --> 03:16:10.391
HAZARDS WERE INTENTIONALLY

03:16:10.458 --> 03:16:12.927
LOCATED. IT'S WHERE PEOPLE HAVE

03:16:12.994 --> 03:16:14.729
LOWER LIFE EXPECTANCIES, HIGHER

03:16:14.796 --> 03:16:17.031
ASTHMA RATES, AND HIGHER RATES

03:16:17.098 --> 03:16:18.666
OF HEART CONDITIONS BECAUSE OF

03:16:18.733 --> 03:16:20.468
ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS THAT WE

03:16:20.535 --> 03:16:23.738
CREATED. CONSTRUCTING A BUILT

03:16:23.805 --> 03:16:24.873
ENVIRONMENT THAT WASN'T GOOD FOR

03:16:24.939 --> 03:16:28.109
PEOPLE TO LIVE IN. THE ABUSES OF

03:16:28.176 --> 03:16:30.245
SEQUA HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO OUR

03:16:30.311 --> 03:16:31.513
HOUSING SHORTAGE. THAT'S WHAT

03:16:31.579 --> 03:16:32.647
OUR COLLEAGUE FROM OAKLAND HAS

03:16:32.714 --> 03:16:34.149
POINTED OUT. IT'S WHAT OUR

03:16:34.215 --> 03:16:35.617
COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO HAS

03:16:35.683 --> 03:16:36.751
POINTED OUT AND SO MANY OTHERS

03:16:36.818 --> 03:16:39.487
ON THIS FLOOR. AND THAT IS WHY

03:16:39.554 --> 03:16:41.322
THIS HISTORIC PIECE OF

03:16:41.389 --> 03:16:43.124
LEGISLATION IS MOVING NOW.

03:16:43.191 --> 03:16:45.193
BECAUSE JUST IN MY DISTRICT,

03:16:45.260 --> 03:16:47.128
WHERE 50,000 UNITS BEHIND ON THE

03:16:47.195 --> 03:16:48.663
WEST SIDE, AND AS A FOUNDING

03:16:48.730 --> 03:16:50.431
MEMBER OF THE RENTERS CAUCUS, I

03:16:50.498 --> 03:16:51.900
CAN TELL YOU IT'S NOT GETTING

03:16:51.966 --> 03:16:55.036
ANY EASIER TO BUY A HOUSE. WE

03:16:55.103 --> 03:16:56.437
ALSO HAVE TO BE MINDFUL, AND

03:16:56.504 --> 03:16:57.805
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING

03:16:57.872 --> 03:16:59.307
ABOUT ALL DAY AND ALL YEAR. AND

03:16:59.374 --> 03:17:01.676
I WANT TO THANK THE SPEAKER FOR

03:17:01.743 --> 03:17:02.710
ALLOWING THIS LEGISLATION TO GO

03:17:02.777 --> 03:17:03.878
THROUGH THE COMMITTEE PROCESS

03:17:03.945 --> 03:17:05.446
AND NOT SURPRISING US ALL AT THE

03:17:05.513 --> 03:17:06.581
LAST MINUTE. WE HEARD THIS. WE

03:17:06.648 --> 03:17:09.384
DEBATED THIS. WHEN YOU BYPASS

03:17:09.450 --> 03:17:10.385
CEQA AND YOU EXEMPT AND YOU

03:17:10.451 --> 03:17:12.320
DON'T STREAMLINE IT, YOU DON'T

03:17:12.387 --> 03:17:13.688
TRIGGER CERTAIN OTHER

03:17:13.755 --> 03:17:15.490
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS AROUND

03:17:15.557 --> 03:17:18.092
ENDANGERED SPECIES. YOU DON'T

03:17:18.159 --> 03:17:19.961
PROVIDE MECHANISMS FOR COMMUNITY

03:17:20.028 --> 03:17:21.462
INPUT IN THE SAME WAY THAT ARE

03:17:21.529 --> 03:17:23.565
BUILT IN THE SEQUEL PROCESS. AND

03:17:23.631 --> 03:17:25.099
YES, YOU DON'T HAVE THE SAME

03:17:25.166 --> 03:17:26.768
TRIBAL CONSULTATION STANDARDS.

03:17:26.834 --> 03:17:28.770
SO I WANT TO THANK OUR COLLEAGUE

03:17:28.836 --> 03:17:29.437
FROM SAN BERNARDINO FOR STEPPING

03:17:29.504 --> 03:17:31.439
UP TO THE PLATE AND MAKING SURE

03:17:31.506 --> 03:17:32.807
THAT THIS BILL HAS TRIBAL

03:17:32.874 --> 03:17:33.608
CONSULTATION STANDARDS. NOBODY

03:17:33.675 --> 03:17:35.009
ON THIS FLOOR CARES MORE ABOUT

03:17:35.076 --> 03:17:36.377
TRIBAL COMMUNITIES THAN OUR

03:17:36.444 --> 03:17:37.579
BROTHER FROM SAN BERNARDINO, AND

03:17:37.645 --> 03:17:39.581
I DON'T THINK WE CAN BE ANY

03:17:39.647 --> 03:17:41.049
STRONGER IN PROTECTING OUR

03:17:41.115 --> 03:17:42.517
TRIBAL COMMUNITIES WITHOUT HIS

03:17:42.584 --> 03:17:45.019
LEADERSHIP. THIS WAS A LABOR OF

03:17:45.086 --> 03:17:47.622
HARD WORK. THIS IS SOMETHING I

03:17:47.689 --> 03:17:48.656
THINK WE'RE ALL GOING TO REFLECT

03:17:48.723 --> 03:17:50.558
ON. THIS IS SOMETHING WE ALSO

03:17:50.625 --> 03:17:51.926
MIGHT LEARN SOME LESSONS FROM

03:17:51.993 --> 03:17:53.394
AND NEED TO CONTINUE TO MAKE

03:17:53.461 --> 03:17:54.562
PROGRESS FOR GOING FORWARD. AND

03:17:54.629 --> 03:17:55.730
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING A

03:17:55.797 --> 03:17:57.465
PART OF THAT JOURNEY WITH ALL OF

03:17:57.532 --> 03:17:59.701
YOU. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR

03:17:59.767 --> 03:18:00.702
YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

03:18:00.768 --> 03:18:02.337
MEMBER BRIAN, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

03:18:02.403 --> 03:18:04.472
WIX, YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK

03:18:04.539 --> 03:18:06.341
YOU, MR. SPEAKER. AND MEMBERS, I

03:18:06.407 --> 03:18:08.443
RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT TODAY OF

03:18:08.509 --> 03:18:10.778
AB 130. AND AS SAID, THERE'S A

03:18:10.845 --> 03:18:12.914
LOT TO THIS BILL. IT'S NOT JUST

03:18:12.981 --> 03:18:13.948
THE SECRET PROVISION, BUT IT'S

03:18:14.015 --> 03:18:16.017
MANY MORE OTHER THINGS AS WELL.

03:18:16.084 --> 03:18:17.685
BUT I WANT TO TAKE A STEP BACK

03:18:17.752 --> 03:18:18.853
AND TALK ABOUT WHAT THIS VOTE

03:18:18.920 --> 03:18:20.688
ACTUALLY MEANS TODAY. AND I KNOW

03:18:20.755 --> 03:18:21.756
I'VE MENTIONED ON THIS FLOOR TO

03:18:21.823 --> 03:18:23.458
YOU ALL BEFORE MY STORY. YOU

03:18:23.524 --> 03:18:25.593
KNOW, AS A LITTLE KID, I GREW UP

03:18:25.660 --> 03:18:28.630
IN A MOBILE HOME PARK, AND THE

03:18:28.696 --> 03:18:30.431
CONVERSATIONS OF HOME OWNERSHIP

03:18:30.498 --> 03:18:32.934
WERE A WEEKLY CONVERSATION IN MY

03:18:33.001 --> 03:18:35.536
HOUSEHOLD. AND THE DREAM OF

03:18:35.603 --> 03:18:38.339
BRUCE AND SHERRY WICKS, AND IT

03:18:38.406 --> 03:18:40.008
PERMEATED EVERY SINGLE FINANCIAL

03:18:40.074 --> 03:18:42.577
DECISION MY HOUSEHOLD MADE. AND

03:18:42.644 --> 03:18:44.846
I VIVIDLY REMEMBER MY PARENTS

03:18:44.912 --> 03:18:46.614
STRUGGLING TO BUILD THEIR LIFE.

03:18:46.681 --> 03:18:49.484
AND I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS ABOUT

03:18:49.550 --> 03:18:50.285
4 OR 5 YEARS OLD, MY MOM WAS

03:18:50.351 --> 03:18:51.452
LEAVING AND I. I PULLED ON HER

03:18:51.519 --> 03:18:53.921
SHIRT AND SAID, MOM, DON'T GO.

03:18:53.988 --> 03:18:55.723
SHE LOOKED AT ME AND SHE SAID,

03:18:55.790 --> 03:18:56.858
ONE DAY YOU'LL APPRECIATE THIS.

03:18:56.924 --> 03:18:58.826
AND SHE WAS GOING TO OUR LOCAL

03:18:58.893 --> 03:19:00.662
COMMUNITY COLLEGE, AND SHE WENT

03:19:00.728 --> 03:19:01.729
TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE, AND SHE

03:19:01.796 --> 03:19:03.164
WENT TO COLLEGE, AND SHE WAS THE

03:19:03.231 --> 03:19:04.699
FIRST PERSON IN HER FAMILY TO

03:19:04.766 --> 03:19:06.868
GET A COLLEGE DEGREE. SHE WAS

03:19:06.934 --> 03:19:07.468
BUILDING THAT BETTER LIFE FOR

03:19:07.535 --> 03:19:09.537
US. AND MY FATHER, NON-COLLEGE

03:19:09.604 --> 03:19:11.439
EDUCATED, DOESN'T HAVE A COLLEGE

03:19:11.506 --> 03:19:14.142
DEGREE, GOT A JOB WITH THE US

03:19:14.208 --> 03:19:15.810
FOREST SERVICE AS A RANGER AND A

03:19:15.877 --> 03:19:17.111
FIREFIGHTER. LITERALLY

03:19:17.178 --> 03:19:18.346
BACKBREAKING WORK. THAT'S WHERE

03:19:18.413 --> 03:19:20.481
I COME FROM. THOSE ARE THAT'S MY

03:19:20.548 --> 03:19:22.650
FAMILY. AND THE IDEA OF OWNING A

03:19:22.717 --> 03:19:24.686
HOME, THE IDEA OF A STICK BUILT

03:19:24.752 --> 03:19:27.989
HOME WITH CONCRETE FOUNDATION.

03:19:28.056 --> 03:19:30.325
THAT WAS MY PARENT'S DREAM. THAT

03:19:30.391 --> 03:19:32.293
WAS THE DREAM THAT WAS INFUSED

03:19:32.360 --> 03:19:33.728
IN ME AND MY BROTHER WHILE WE

03:19:33.795 --> 03:19:35.930
WERE KIDS. AND THEN WHEN I

03:19:35.997 --> 03:19:37.465
EMBARKED ON MY JOURNEY AND WHEN

03:19:37.532 --> 03:19:38.833
I WENT TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE, AND

03:19:38.900 --> 03:19:41.035
I WENT TO COLLEGE AND BECAME A

03:19:41.102 --> 03:19:42.337
WORKING PROFESSIONAL, AND I HAD

03:19:42.403 --> 03:19:44.172
THE WORLD AT MY FINGERTIPS

03:19:44.238 --> 03:19:46.240
BECAUSE OF MY PARENTS SACRIFICE.

03:19:46.307 --> 03:19:48.810
AND WHEN I STARTED A FAMILY,

03:19:48.876 --> 03:19:50.678
THEIR DREAM THEN BECAME MY

03:19:50.745 --> 03:19:53.548
DREAM. I WANTED TO OWN A HOME. I

03:19:53.614 --> 03:19:55.883
WANTED THAT OPPORTUNITY. AND

03:19:55.950 --> 03:19:57.952
GOING THROUGH THAT PROCESS

03:19:58.019 --> 03:19:59.687
FINALLY, IN MY 40S, AS A FIRST

03:19:59.754 --> 03:20:02.357
TIME HOMEOWNER IN MY 40S, GOING

03:20:02.423 --> 03:20:04.325
THROUGH THAT PROCESS AND

03:20:04.392 --> 03:20:06.461
REALIZING THE HERCULEAN EFFORT

03:20:06.527 --> 03:20:09.430
TO BE ABLE TO PUT DOWN A DOWN

03:20:09.497 --> 03:20:10.698
PAYMENT IN THIS WORLD THAT WE

03:20:10.765 --> 03:20:11.999
LIVE IN IN CALIFORNIA TODAY. AND

03:20:12.066 --> 03:20:13.668
I KNOW OUR RENTERS CAUCUS CAN

03:20:13.735 --> 03:20:15.136
APPRECIATE THAT, AND THEY'RE

03:20:15.203 --> 03:20:16.604
STRUGGLING TO TRY TO DO THE SAME

03:20:16.671 --> 03:20:18.473
THING. AND THEN IF YOU HAVE THE

03:20:18.539 --> 03:20:20.308
MONEY FOR THE DOWN PAYMENT,

03:20:20.375 --> 03:20:23.144
AFFORDING THE MORTGAGE, WHICH IS

03:20:23.211 --> 03:20:25.113
INSANE, AND THEN THE COST OF

03:20:25.179 --> 03:20:26.481
CHILDCARE ON TOP OF THAT AND THE

03:20:26.547 --> 03:20:28.616
COST OF HEALTHCARE ON TOP OF

03:20:28.683 --> 03:20:29.784
THAT, ON TOP OF THAT, AND THE

03:20:29.851 --> 03:20:31.719
COST OF ALL THE THINGS ON TOP OF

03:20:31.786 --> 03:20:33.688
THAT, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU

03:20:33.755 --> 03:20:35.289
FEEL LIKE YOU'RE DROWNING JUST

03:20:35.356 --> 03:20:36.391
TO SURVIVE. THAT IS THE REALITY

03:20:36.457 --> 03:20:38.226
OF TOO MANY OF OUR FAMILIES HERE

03:20:38.292 --> 03:20:39.260
IN CALIFORNIA. AND I'M ONE OF

03:20:39.327 --> 03:20:41.796
THE LUCKY ONES WHO SOMEHOW HAS

03:20:41.863 --> 03:20:43.331
FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO IT. BUT

03:20:43.398 --> 03:20:43.965
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:20:44.031 --> 03:20:45.633
HERE. SO WHEN I GOT ELECTED IN

03:20:45.700 --> 03:20:47.335
2018, I DECIDED THIS WAS THE

03:20:47.402 --> 03:20:49.337
THING THAT I WANTED TO WORK ON.

03:20:49.404 --> 03:20:51.539
THIS IS WHAT I WANTED TO BE

03:20:51.606 --> 03:20:52.340
MEASURED BY, AND I KNEW THIS

03:20:52.407 --> 03:20:54.776
WOULD BE MY FOCUS. AND I STARTED

03:20:54.842 --> 03:20:56.644
TO ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS. WHY

03:20:56.711 --> 03:20:57.612
DO WE HAVE THIS HOUSING CRISIS?

03:20:57.678 --> 03:20:58.846
WHY DO WE HAVE ALMOST 200,000

03:20:58.913 --> 03:21:00.448
FOLKS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS

03:21:00.515 --> 03:21:02.450
EVERY DAY IN OUR STATE? WHY DO

03:21:02.517 --> 03:21:04.585
WE HAVE SOME OF THE WORST

03:21:04.652 --> 03:21:05.520
HOMEOWNERSHIP RATES IN THE

03:21:05.586 --> 03:21:07.889
COUNTRY? WHY IS IT SO DAMN HARD

03:21:07.955 --> 03:21:09.757
TO BUILD HOUSING IN THE STATE OF

03:21:09.824 --> 03:21:11.659
CALIFORNIA? WHY IS IT THAT OUR

03:21:11.726 --> 03:21:13.594
WORKING CLASS FAMILIES, THE ONES

03:21:13.661 --> 03:21:15.730
WITH THE FEWEST, MEANS THOSE ARE

03:21:15.797 --> 03:21:17.432
THE ONES BEARING THE BRUNT OF

03:21:17.498 --> 03:21:21.002
THIS CRISIS? AND I SOON REALIZED

03:21:21.068 --> 03:21:22.937
THIS WAS IN PART BECAUSE OF OUR

03:21:23.004 --> 03:21:26.374
OWN DOING, THAT WE CREATED THIS

03:21:26.441 --> 03:21:29.510
SITUATION. WE HAVE MADE IT TOO

03:21:29.577 --> 03:21:31.379
DIFFICULT TO BUILD HERE. I

03:21:31.446 --> 03:21:32.947
REALIZED THAT THE SPECIAL

03:21:33.014 --> 03:21:34.348
INTERESTS ARE VERY STRONG IN

03:21:34.415 --> 03:21:36.250
THIS STATE. I REALIZED THE

03:21:36.317 --> 03:21:38.219
STATUS QUO IS CEMENTED HERE. I

03:21:38.286 --> 03:21:40.922
REALIZE THE INERTIA IS VERY

03:21:40.988 --> 03:21:41.989
GRIPPING TO MAKE THE STRUCTURAL

03:21:42.056 --> 03:21:43.791
CHANGE THAT WE WANT TO SEE, AND

03:21:43.858 --> 03:21:45.927
WE'VE DABBLED AROUND THE EDGES.

03:21:45.993 --> 03:21:48.329
MANY OF US HAVE. AND MANY OF THE

03:21:48.396 --> 03:21:49.764
COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE SPOKEN HERE

03:21:49.831 --> 03:21:51.599
HAVE DABBLED AROUND THE EDGES.

03:21:51.666 --> 03:21:53.434
WE'VE DONE GOOD THINGS. WE'VE

03:21:53.501 --> 03:21:54.635
BEEFED UP ENFORCEMENT, WE'VE

03:21:54.702 --> 03:21:56.037
DONE REZONING, WE'VE ENSURED

03:21:56.103 --> 03:21:57.705
MORE LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY. WE'VE

03:21:57.772 --> 03:21:59.040
STREAMLINED ADUS, WE'VE DONE

03:21:59.106 --> 03:22:00.975
GOOD THINGS. BUT HAVE WE TRULY

03:22:01.042 --> 03:22:03.444
FIXED THIS PROBLEM? HAVE WE

03:22:03.511 --> 03:22:05.246
CREATED THE STRUCTURAL CHANGE

03:22:05.313 --> 03:22:06.547
NEEDED IN ORDER TO BUILD THE

03:22:06.614 --> 03:22:08.850
MILLIONS OF UNITS, THE MILLIONS

03:22:08.916 --> 03:22:10.618
OF ROOF OVER HEAD FOR OUR

03:22:10.685 --> 03:22:12.386
WORKING CLASS FAMILIES HERE IN

03:22:12.453 --> 03:22:13.421
CALIFORNIA THAT THIS STATE

03:22:13.488 --> 03:22:15.356
DESERVES? AND I THINK THE ANSWER

03:22:15.423 --> 03:22:17.725
IS NO. WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY DONE

03:22:17.792 --> 03:22:19.594
THAT YET. AND I KNOW THAT'S A

03:22:19.660 --> 03:22:21.362
HARD PILL TO SWALLOW FOR THOSE

03:22:21.429 --> 03:22:22.964
OF US WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING ON

03:22:23.030 --> 03:22:24.232
THIS DAY IN AND DAY OUT FOR

03:22:24.298 --> 03:22:26.701
YEARS. BUT IT IS THE TRUTH. AND

03:22:26.767 --> 03:22:29.737
SO THIS YEAR, WITH THIS VOTE, WE

03:22:29.804 --> 03:22:32.840
ARE TAKING A LEAP. WE ARE TAKING

03:22:32.907 --> 03:22:35.343
THAT BIG LEAP. THAT IS WHAT THIS

03:22:35.409 --> 03:22:37.211
BILL IS ABOUT. AND THERE'S A LOT

03:22:37.278 --> 03:22:39.313
TO THE BILL. BUT WHAT I WANT TO

03:22:39.380 --> 03:22:40.915
TALK ABOUT IS THE TRULY

03:22:40.982 --> 03:22:41.849
TRANSFORMATIVE WORK THAT HAS

03:22:41.916 --> 03:22:43.651
BEEN DONE ON THE CEQA REFORM

03:22:43.718 --> 03:22:46.854
ASPECT OF THIS BILL. CEQA WILL

03:22:46.921 --> 03:22:48.456
NO LONGER BE ABLE TO BE

03:22:48.523 --> 03:22:49.724
WEAPONIZED TO STOP THE

03:22:49.790 --> 03:22:50.892
CRITICALLY NEEDED INFILL

03:22:50.958 --> 03:22:53.761
HOUSING. YEARS AND YEARS AND

03:22:53.828 --> 03:22:55.997
YEARS AND YEARS OF LEGAL DELAYS

03:22:56.063 --> 03:22:58.032
WILL WILL NOW BE A THING OF THE

03:22:58.099 --> 03:22:59.800
PAST. MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND

03:22:59.867 --> 03:23:01.369
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF LAWSUITS

03:23:01.435 --> 03:23:04.205
WILL NO LONGER BE ALLOWED.

03:23:04.272 --> 03:23:06.340
SAYING NO TO HOUSING IN MY

03:23:06.407 --> 03:23:08.843
COMMUNITY WILL NO LONGER BE

03:23:08.910 --> 03:23:10.778
STATE SANCTIONED. THIS ISN'T

03:23:10.845 --> 03:23:12.580
GOING TO SOLVE ALL OF OUR

03:23:12.647 --> 03:23:14.315
HOUSING PROBLEMS IN THE STATE,

03:23:14.382 --> 03:23:16.117
BUT IT IS GOING TO REMOVE THE

03:23:16.183 --> 03:23:18.286
SINGLE BIGGEST IMPEDIMENT TO

03:23:18.352 --> 03:23:20.021
BUILDING ENVIRONMENTALLY

03:23:20.087 --> 03:23:22.557
FRIENDLY HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA.

03:23:22.623 --> 03:23:25.526
THAT IS WHAT THIS VOTE IS ABOUT.

03:23:25.593 --> 03:23:27.128
WE ARE IN THESE ROLES OF POWER

03:23:27.194 --> 03:23:29.497
AND PRIVILEGE FOR A BLINK OF AN

03:23:29.564 --> 03:23:31.999
EYE IN OUR LIFETIMES. THAT IS

03:23:32.066 --> 03:23:33.901
HOW LONG WE ARE HERE, AND WE

03:23:33.968 --> 03:23:35.836
HAVE A GREAT RESPONSIBILITY IN

03:23:35.903 --> 03:23:38.406
THAT TIME. AND THIS, TO ME, IS

03:23:38.472 --> 03:23:40.608
ONE OF THOSE VOTES. THIS IS A

03:23:40.675 --> 03:23:42.710
VOTE FOR THE BIGGEST CEQA REFORM

03:23:42.777 --> 03:23:44.779
IN 55 YEARS, AND THIS HAS BEEN

03:23:44.845 --> 03:23:46.380
DECADES IN THE MAKING. EVERY

03:23:46.447 --> 03:23:47.715
GOVERNOR SINCE RONALD REAGAN HAS

03:23:47.782 --> 03:23:49.584
ATTEMPTED THIS. AND NOW TODAY,

03:23:49.650 --> 03:23:51.485
WE SIT ON THE PRECIPICE OF THAT

03:23:51.552 --> 03:23:53.220
CHANGE WITH A THREE PARTY DEAL

03:23:53.287 --> 03:23:55.990
LED BY THIS SPEAKER AND THE

03:23:56.057 --> 03:23:57.858
SENATE AND THE GOVERNOR, WHO PUT

03:23:57.925 --> 03:23:59.860
SKIN IN THE GAME ON THIS TO MAKE

03:23:59.927 --> 03:24:01.762
THIS A REALITY. AND OUR BUDGET

03:24:01.829 --> 03:24:03.364
CHAIR AND OUR HOUSING CHAIR AND

03:24:03.431 --> 03:24:05.333
OUR NATURAL RESOURCES CHAIR, AND

03:24:05.399 --> 03:24:06.734
EVERYONE ELSE WHO HAS BEEN

03:24:06.801 --> 03:24:08.302
WORKING ON THIS, AND IT HASN'T

03:24:08.369 --> 03:24:10.838
COME EASY. BUT THROUGH THAT KIND

03:24:10.905 --> 03:24:11.872
OF PARTNERSHIP, WE CAN MAKE THE
