CHAIR. I THANK YOU FOR THE

00:55:57.153 --> 00:55:58.254
OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS

00:55:58.321 --> 00:55:59.389
BILL. WE WERE IN THE INSURANCE

00:55:59.456 --> 00:56:00.990
COMMITTEE EARLIER TODAY, AND I'M

00:56:01.057 --> 00:56:02.992
PLEASED TO ACCEPT THE

00:56:03.059 --> 00:56:03.593
COMMITTEE'S AMENDMENTS THAT I

00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:04.761
KNOW WERE DEVELOPED IN

00:56:04.828 --> 00:56:05.528
CONJUNCTION WITH THAT COMMITTEE

00:56:05.595 --> 00:56:07.997
AS WELL. WHEN WE MADE THE

00:56:08.064 --> 00:56:08.665
SIMILAR COMMITMENTS TO AMEND THE

00:56:08.732 --> 00:56:10.200
BILL. AND JUST TO SUMMARIZE, TO

00:56:10.266 --> 00:56:11.534
RECAST THE INTENT LANGUAGE IN

00:56:11.601 --> 00:56:13.336
SECTION THREE OF THE BILL TO

00:56:13.403 --> 00:56:14.471
INSTEAD BE FINDINGS AND

00:56:14.537 --> 00:56:15.905
DECLARATIONS. NUMBER TWO, TO

00:56:15.972 --> 00:56:18.141
INCREASE THE INSURANCE LIMITS TO

00:56:18.208 --> 00:56:20.477
100 PER PERSON AND $300,000 PER

00:56:20.543 --> 00:56:22.345
ACCIDENT. AND THIRD, TO REQUIRE

00:56:22.412 --> 00:56:23.613
A JOINT STUDY FROM THE

00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:25.315
DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE AND THE

00:56:25.381 --> 00:56:28.384
PUC ON THE IMPACTS FOR THE BILL

00:56:28.451 --> 00:56:31.287
AS WELL. SO I'D BE HAPPY TO

00:56:31.354 --> 00:56:33.723
ACCEPT THOSE. SO I THIS

00:56:33.790 --> 00:56:35.425
LEGISLATION IS HERE BECAUSE WHEN

00:56:35.492 --> 00:56:37.961
THE RIDESHARE SECTOR BEGAN NOT

00:56:38.027 --> 00:56:40.697
THAT LONG AGO, THE LEGISLATURE

00:56:40.764 --> 00:56:43.266
MOVED SWIFTLY AND SO DID THE PUC

00:56:43.333 --> 00:56:44.934
TO COME UP WITH A COMPREHENSIVE

00:56:45.001 --> 00:56:46.369
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR WHAT

00:56:46.436 --> 00:56:49.973
WAS THEN A COMPLETELY NOVEL AND

00:56:50.039 --> 00:56:52.108
COUNTERINTUITIVE INNOVATION THAT

00:56:52.175 --> 00:56:54.344
MOST CALIFORNIANS WERE

00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:56.346
SUSPICIOUS OF, THAT, THAT WE

00:56:56.412 --> 00:56:58.248
DON'T GET IN EACH OTHER'S CARS,

00:56:58.314 --> 00:57:00.049
WE DON'T INVITE PEOPLE INTO OUR

00:57:00.116 --> 00:57:03.186
CARS. AND THIS WAS A INTERESTING

00:57:03.253 --> 00:57:05.121
NOVEL SITUATION THAT WAS

00:57:05.188 --> 00:57:06.322
EMERGING. BUT THE REGULATORY

00:57:06.389 --> 00:57:08.358
FRAMEWORK HAD TO EXIST, AND NONE

00:57:08.424 --> 00:57:09.192
OF IT WAS IN PLACE. AND SO THE

00:57:09.259 --> 00:57:10.927
LEGISLATURE DID PASS A VARIETY

00:57:10.994 --> 00:57:13.163
OF BILLS. THE PUC TOOK ACTIONS,

00:57:13.229 --> 00:57:15.365
BUT ONE OF THE KEY ONES WAS THE

00:57:15.431 --> 00:57:16.566
LEGISLATION BY ASSEMBLYWOMAN

00:57:16.633 --> 00:57:19.636
SUSAN BONILLA FROM MY SENATORIAL

00:57:19.702 --> 00:57:21.337
DISTRICT THAT CRAFTED THE

00:57:21.404 --> 00:57:22.906
INSURANCE PROVISIONS FOR THE FOR

00:57:22.972 --> 00:57:24.641
THE SECTOR. IF YOU LOOK AT THE

00:57:24.707 --> 00:57:26.709
COMMITTEE ANALYZES THE TESTIMONY

00:57:26.776 --> 00:57:28.878
AND THE PUC RECORDS FROM THAT

00:57:28.945 --> 00:57:30.747
TIME, THEY ALL BASICALLY SAY THE

00:57:30.814 --> 00:57:32.115
SAME THING. THEY EITHER DON'T

00:57:32.182 --> 00:57:35.752
MENTION UIM WHATSOEVER, OR THE

00:57:35.819 --> 00:57:36.452
ONE REFERENCE THAT'S IN A

00:57:36.519 --> 00:57:37.921
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IS, HEY, IT'S

00:57:37.987 --> 00:57:40.456
ANYBODY'S GUESS WHAT WE SHOULD

00:57:40.523 --> 00:57:43.359
SET. AND SO THERE THERE'S A LOT

00:57:43.426 --> 00:57:45.261
OF WORK ON THE OVERALL INSURANCE

00:57:45.328 --> 00:57:45.929
FRAMEWORK AND ON THE REGULATORY

00:57:45.995 --> 00:57:48.498
FRAMEWORK, BUT NOT ON UIM. THESE

00:57:48.565 --> 00:57:50.133
LIMITS ARE IN PLACE LARGELY

00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:51.601
BECAUSE THEY HAPPEN TO BE WHAT

00:57:51.668 --> 00:57:53.469
ONE OF THE RIDESHARE COMPANIES

00:57:53.536 --> 00:57:55.038
WAS DOING AT THAT TIME. AND

00:57:55.104 --> 00:57:56.706
THAT'S WHAT THE BILL IS

00:57:56.773 --> 00:57:58.741
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT. ONLY THE UIM

00:57:58.808 --> 00:58:00.577
PORTION OF THE INSURANCE, OF THE

00:58:00.643 --> 00:58:01.978
MANY LAYERS OF OVERLAPPING

00:58:02.045 --> 00:58:04.681
INSURANCE THAT THAT PROTECT BOTH

00:58:04.747 --> 00:58:06.382
DRIVERS AND RIDERS IN ANY KIND

00:58:06.449 --> 00:58:09.352
OF ACCIDENT. SO IT'S WHERE THE

00:58:09.419 --> 00:58:11.387
DRIVER IS NOT AT FAULT. AND SO

00:58:11.454 --> 00:58:13.223
THOSE LIMITS WERE SET AT $1

00:58:13.289 --> 00:58:14.924
MILLION, WHICH IS A PROVISION

00:58:14.991 --> 00:58:16.326
THAT APPLIES TO NO OTHER

00:58:16.392 --> 00:58:18.294
SIMILARLY SITUATED

00:58:18.361 --> 00:58:19.662
TRANSPORTATION IN THE STATE.

00:58:19.729 --> 00:58:22.699
TAXIS, UBER, BLACK BUSSES OR

00:58:22.765 --> 00:58:25.802
ANYTHING ELSE IN CALIFORNIA. AND

00:58:25.869 --> 00:58:27.904
SINCE THAT TIME, WHAT WE'VE SEEN

00:58:27.971 --> 00:58:30.773
IS CASES AND CLAIMS THAT ARE FAR

00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:32.375
UNDER THAT FIGURE IN VIRTUALLY

00:58:32.442 --> 00:58:34.677
ALL CASES. BUT ALSO WE'VE SEEN

00:58:34.744 --> 00:58:36.646
INSURANCE COSTS BECAUSE WE'RE

00:58:36.713 --> 00:58:38.848
WE'RE INSISTING ON INSURANCE

00:58:38.915 --> 00:58:40.216
LEVELS THAT ARE HIGHER THAN THE

00:58:40.283 --> 00:58:42.418
CLAIMS IN CASES. THOSE COSTS

00:58:42.485 --> 00:58:44.621
HAVE BALLOONED AND THEY ARE

00:58:44.687 --> 00:58:45.255
SUBSTANTIAL PART OF FARES. SO

00:58:45.321 --> 00:58:47.824
THIS BILL IS SOLELY, EXCLUSIVELY

00:58:47.891 --> 00:58:49.592
A BILL ABOUT AFFORDABILITY TO

00:58:49.659 --> 00:58:52.362
REDUCE FARES FOR RIDERS AND ALSO

00:58:52.428 --> 00:58:54.597
TO INCREASE THE SHARE OF THE OF

00:58:54.664 --> 00:58:57.800
THE FARES THAT WE DO PAY THAT GO

00:58:57.867 --> 00:58:58.368
TO DRIVERS ONE BECAUSE THEY

00:58:58.434 --> 00:58:59.769
DESERVE IT. IF YOU'VE TALKED TO

00:58:59.836 --> 00:59:02.372
A RIDESHARE DRIVER EVER AND

00:59:02.438 --> 00:59:03.439
THEY'VE ASKED YOU, WELL, WHAT

00:59:03.506 --> 00:59:04.474
ARE YOU PAYING? BECAUSE HERE'S

00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:06.509
HOW MUCH I'M MAKING. WE'RE

00:59:06.576 --> 00:59:08.611
TRYING TO MAKE SURE MORE OF THE

00:59:08.678 --> 00:59:10.013
MORE OF WHAT WE PAY GETS IN THE

00:59:10.079 --> 00:59:11.414
DRIVER'S POCKETS, BOTH BECAUSE

00:59:11.481 --> 00:59:12.382
THEY DESERVE IT AND THEY'RE

00:59:12.448 --> 00:59:14.150
ENTITLED TO IT. IT'S THE RIGHT

00:59:14.217 --> 00:59:16.219
THING TO DO, BUT ALSO BECAUSE

00:59:16.286 --> 00:59:17.353
THIS RIDESHARE MARKETPLACE

00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:18.955
DEPENDS ON DRIVERS SIGNING UP,

00:59:19.022 --> 00:59:20.924
AND WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH DRIVERS

00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:23.293
TO BE ABLE TO CREATE ACCESS, BUT

00:59:23.359 --> 00:59:24.994
ALSO AFFORDABLE FARES IN

00:59:25.061 --> 00:59:26.129
CALIFORNIA. SO THIS BILL IS

00:59:26.195 --> 00:59:28.765
INTENDED TO REDUCE FARES, TO

00:59:28.831 --> 00:59:30.833
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DOLLARS TO

00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:32.735
DRIVERS. ALTHOUGH IT'S FOR

00:59:32.802 --> 00:59:33.803
SHORTHAND, THIS IS OFTEN CALLED

00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:34.938
THE UBER AND LYFT INSURANCE

00:59:35.004 --> 00:59:37.006
BILL. IT ISN'T ONLY THEM. PART

00:59:37.073 --> 00:59:37.674
OF THE REASON I'M CARRYING THIS

00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:39.642
BILL IS THAT IN RURAL AND

00:59:39.709 --> 00:59:41.244
SUBURBAN PARTS OF CALIFORNIA, MY

00:59:41.311 --> 00:59:43.046
COUNTY, MY CITY IS ONE EXAMPLE

00:59:43.112 --> 00:59:45.214
WHERE A PRIVATE, PUBLICLY

00:59:45.281 --> 00:59:46.716
CONTRACTED PRIVATE

00:59:46.783 --> 00:59:48.184
TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANY

00:59:48.251 --> 00:59:50.753
IS THE BACKBONE TRANSIT SERVICE.

00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:52.055
IT WORKS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE

00:59:52.121 --> 00:59:53.656
LOCAL BUS SERVICE. AND SO THIS

00:59:53.723 --> 00:59:56.025
IS UNLIKE WHEN THIS WHEN THE

00:59:56.092 --> 00:59:57.093
LIMITS WERE ORIGINALLY CREATED.

00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:58.594
THIS IS NO LONGER SORT OF AN

00:59:58.661 --> 01:00:00.296
OPTIONAL THING FOR HIP YOUNG

01:00:00.363 --> 01:00:03.232
PEOPLE WHO ARE RISK, RISK LOVING

01:00:03.299 --> 01:00:05.368
TO DO. IT IS BASIC IN ORDER TO

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:08.304
GET TO WORK, TO GO VISIT

01:00:08.371 --> 01:00:08.905
GRANDMA, TO GET TO CHURCH, TO

01:00:08.972 --> 01:00:11.507
PICK UP THE KIDS, TO GET ICE

01:00:11.574 --> 01:00:12.308
CREAM. LIKE WHATEVER IT IS THAT,

01:00:12.375 --> 01:00:14.510
THAT WE NEED, THIS IS THIS IS A

01:00:14.577 --> 01:00:16.212
FUNDAMENTAL PART OF OUR LIVES

01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:17.180
TODAY. AND SO ONE WAY THAT WE

01:00:17.246 --> 01:00:18.414
CAN MAKE CALIFORNIA MUCH MORE

01:00:18.481 --> 01:00:20.416
AFFORDABLE IS TO TACKLE AN AREA

01:00:20.483 --> 01:00:21.784
WHERE WE'VE SEEN SIGNIFICANT

01:00:21.851 --> 01:00:22.385
GROWTH IN, IN MONEY THAT IS,

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:24.520
THAT IS, IS NEEDS TO BE IN

01:00:24.587 --> 01:00:25.655
PEOPLE'S POCKETBOOKS. THAT'S

01:00:25.722 --> 01:00:28.858
BASED ON THE ACTUAL CLAIMS AND

01:00:28.925 --> 01:00:31.327
COST DATA IN THE LAST DECADE

01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:34.030
THAT, THAT, THAT REVIEWS THAT.

01:00:34.097 --> 01:00:35.631
AND SO THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE

01:00:35.698 --> 01:00:38.634
BILL. IT'S SIMPLE AND MODEST IN

01:00:38.701 --> 01:00:40.069
WAYS, BUT I WANT TO JUST ASSURE

01:00:40.136 --> 01:00:41.337
THE COMMITTEE WORKED REALLY HARD

01:00:41.404 --> 01:00:42.839
TO STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE. BUT

01:00:42.905 --> 01:00:45.675
THE FUNDAMENTAL PURPOSE HERE IS

01:00:45.742 --> 01:00:47.510
TO IS TO RIGHTSIZE THE INSURANCE

01:00:47.577 --> 01:00:49.312
COVERAGE TO MATCH THE EXPOSURE

01:00:49.379 --> 01:00:52.582
IN ORDER TO REDUCE FARES AND

01:00:52.648 --> 01:00:54.083
RIGHTSIZE THE MARKETPLACE, SO

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:55.385
THAT RIDERS IN CALIFORNIA CAN

01:00:55.451 --> 01:00:57.353
AFFORD TO CONTINUE GETTING

01:00:57.420 --> 01:00:59.255
AROUND. AND WITH THAT, ASK FOR

01:00:59.322 --> 01:01:01.324
YOUR VOTE. BUT I WANT TO TURN

01:01:01.391 --> 01:01:02.325
NEXT TO RAMONA PRIETO

01:01:02.392 --> 01:01:03.760
REPRESENTING UBER. GOOD

01:01:03.826 --> 01:01:04.894
AFTERNOON, MADAM CHAIR, AND

01:01:04.961 --> 01:01:06.796
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. FOR

01:01:06.863 --> 01:01:08.631
THOSE OF YOU I DON'T HAVE THE

01:01:08.698 --> 01:01:09.532
PLEASURE OF KNOWING YET. MY NAME

01:01:09.599 --> 01:01:10.500
IS RAMONA PRIETO. I'M THE

01:01:10.566 --> 01:01:12.668
DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC POLICY FOR

01:01:12.735 --> 01:01:13.636
UBER, AND I'M HERE TODAY TO

01:01:13.703 --> 01:01:15.004
EXPRESS OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR

01:01:15.071 --> 01:01:17.707
SB 3071, A TARGETED FIX TO A

01:01:17.774 --> 01:01:19.609
PROBLEM THAT'S QUIETLY MAKING

01:01:19.675 --> 01:01:21.144
RIDESHARE MORE EXPENSIVE FOR

01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:22.412
MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS. I WILL

01:01:22.478 --> 01:01:24.680
ECHO THE SENATOR ON MANY OF HIS

01:01:24.747 --> 01:01:26.883
KEY POINTS TODAY. EACH TRIP IS

01:01:26.949 --> 01:01:28.951
COVERED BY MULTIPLE FORMS OF

01:01:29.018 --> 01:01:30.253
INSURANCE $1 MILLION IN

01:01:30.319 --> 01:01:32.355
LIABILITY INSURANCE, $1 MILLION

01:01:32.422 --> 01:01:33.489
IN OCCUPATIONAL ACCIDENT

01:01:33.556 --> 01:01:35.425
INSURANCE TO PROTECT DRIVERS

01:01:35.491 --> 01:01:37.693
PHYSICAL DAMAGE COVERAGE. THREE

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:40.063
POLICIES THAT SB 371 DOES NOT

01:01:40.129 --> 01:01:42.965
TOUCH. AND LASTLY, $1 MILLION OF

01:01:43.032 --> 01:01:44.867
UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED

01:01:44.934 --> 01:01:47.637
MOTORIST COVERAGE FOR WHEN

01:01:47.703 --> 01:01:49.806
DRIVERS ARE NOT AS AT FAULT. NO

01:01:49.872 --> 01:01:51.541
OTHER VEHICLE ON CALIFORNIA

01:01:51.607 --> 01:01:53.476
ROADWAYS CARRIED THIS POLICY.

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:55.144
NOT PUBLIC SCHOOL BUSSES, NOT

01:01:55.211 --> 01:01:58.448
TAXIS, NOT PERSONAL CARS, ONLY

01:01:58.514 --> 01:02:00.216
RIDESHARE. AND THIS POLICY HAS

01:02:00.283 --> 01:02:01.984
BECOME THE SINGLE BIGGEST COST

01:02:02.051 --> 01:02:04.587
DRIVER TO RIDERS IN L.A. COUNTY.

01:02:04.654 --> 01:02:07.857
AS EXAMPLE, 45% OF EVERY FARE IS

01:02:07.924 --> 01:02:09.592
A STRAIGHT PASS THROUGH TO

01:02:09.659 --> 01:02:11.661
GOVERNMENT MANDATED INSURANCE.

01:02:11.727 --> 01:02:14.697
THAT'S AROUND 32% ACROSS THE

01:02:14.764 --> 01:02:16.332
CALIFORNIA AVERAGE. AND TO BE

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:18.201
CLEAR, THESE COSTS ARE A DIRECT

01:02:18.267 --> 01:02:20.369
PASS THROUGH TO RIDERS, AND IT'S

01:02:20.436 --> 01:02:21.771
REFLECTED ON RIDER RECEIPTS AS

01:02:21.838 --> 01:02:23.773
THE BOOKING FEE. THESE COSTS ARE

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.741
PASSED TO THE PEOPLE WHO RELY ON

01:02:25.808 --> 01:02:26.375
RIDESHARE TO GET TO WORK, TO

01:02:26.442 --> 01:02:27.543
SCHOOL, TO DOCTOR'S

01:02:27.610 --> 01:02:29.312
APPOINTMENTS. AND THEY'RE

01:02:29.378 --> 01:02:30.079
CUTTING INTO THE EARNINGS OF

01:02:30.146 --> 01:02:30.847
DRIVERS WHO KEEP OUR PLATFORM

01:02:30.913 --> 01:02:32.448
MOVING. I'M PROUD TO HAVE WITH

01:02:32.515 --> 01:02:33.883
ME TODAY A LETTER OF SUPPORT

01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:36.986
SIGNED BY 7000 RIDESHARE DRIVERS

01:02:37.053 --> 01:02:39.889
AND SP 371, AND THE CHANGES IN

01:02:39.956 --> 01:02:41.924
FRONT OF YOU ARE INFORMED BY

01:02:41.991 --> 01:02:43.392
DATA MODERNIZING THE COVERAGE

01:02:43.459 --> 01:02:44.627
REQUIREMENT, BUT STILL ABOVE

01:02:44.694 --> 01:02:46.429
WHAT IS REQUIRED BY LAW FOR

01:02:46.496 --> 01:02:48.197
ANYBODY ELSE. IT DEFINES THAT

01:02:48.264 --> 01:02:49.332
DRIVERS WILL NEVER HAVE TO CARRY

01:02:49.398 --> 01:02:51.667
THIS POLICY, AND IT ENSURES THAT

01:02:51.734 --> 01:02:53.836
RIDESHARE UIM POLICY WILL BE

01:02:53.903 --> 01:02:55.638
PRIMARY TO OTHER LIKE POLICIES.

01:02:55.705 --> 01:02:57.640
ON BEHALF OF UBER, I

01:02:57.707 --> 01:02:58.975
RESPECTFULLY ENCOURAGE YOUR

01:02:59.041 --> 01:03:01.744
SUPPORT ON SB 371 SO WE CAN

01:03:01.811 --> 01:03:02.311
CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION OF

01:03:02.378 --> 01:03:03.646
THIS IMPORTANT REFORM, AND WE

01:03:03.713 --> 01:03:06.816
REMAIN COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH

01:03:06.883 --> 01:03:08.117
THE CHAIR IN THIS COMMITTEE.

01:03:08.184 --> 01:03:10.086
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD

01:03:10.153 --> 01:03:11.621
AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS NICK

01:03:11.687 --> 01:03:12.755
JOHNSON, PUBLIC POLICY DIRECTOR

01:03:12.822 --> 01:03:14.157
AT LYFT. GOOD AFTERNOON, MADAM

01:03:14.223 --> 01:03:15.424
CHAIR, AND ESTEEMED MEMBERS OF

01:03:15.491 --> 01:03:16.559
THIS COMMITTEE. I'M HERE AND

01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:17.894
SPEAKING TODAY IN SUPPORT OF

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:20.496
SENATE BILL 371, WHICH AIMS TO

01:03:20.563 --> 01:03:21.864
ADDRESS THE AFFORDABILITY OF

01:03:21.931 --> 01:03:24.267
RIDESHARE SERVICES BY ADJUSTING

01:03:24.333 --> 01:03:25.168
UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED

01:03:25.234 --> 01:03:26.702
MOTORIST COVERAGE LIMITS, WHICH

01:03:26.769 --> 01:03:28.404
WERE ESTABLISHED OVER A DECADE

01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:29.839
AGO. AND I ACKNOWLEDGE THE

01:03:29.906 --> 01:03:31.207
INHERENT CHALLENGES IN

01:03:31.274 --> 01:03:32.241
ESTABLISHING THAT REQUIREMENT.

01:03:32.308 --> 01:03:34.010
AT THAT TIME. WE DIDN'T HAVE A

01:03:34.076 --> 01:03:35.711
LOT OF DATA DURING THAT TIME,

01:03:35.778 --> 01:03:37.980
AND THIS WAS A NOVEL INDUSTRY ON

01:03:38.047 --> 01:03:40.216
THE RISE. SO WE RECOGNIZE THAT

01:03:40.283 --> 01:03:42.885
THIS PROPOSED CHANGE IS A

01:03:42.952 --> 01:03:44.587
PARADIGM SHIFT. NEVERTHELESS,

01:03:44.654 --> 01:03:46.422
OUR OBSERVATIONS INDICATE THAT

01:03:46.489 --> 01:03:48.925
THE ELEVATED LIMITS MANDATED BY

01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:51.127
UIM HAVE BECOME ECONOMICALLY

01:03:51.194 --> 01:03:52.361
INEFFICIENT. THIS INEFFICIENCY

01:03:52.428 --> 01:03:54.730
IS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO

01:03:54.797 --> 01:03:55.665
INFLATED ATTORNEY REPRESENTED

01:03:55.731 --> 01:03:56.766
CLAIMS, OFTEN INVOLVING

01:03:56.832 --> 01:03:58.668
SUBSTANTIAL CONTINGENCY FEES,

01:03:58.734 --> 01:04:00.169
WHICH CONSEQUENTLY DRIVE UP

01:04:00.236 --> 01:04:01.871
FARES. IT IS IMPORTANT TO DEFINE

01:04:01.938 --> 01:04:03.873
THE SCOPE WITHIN WHICH THIS BILL

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:06.209
WOULD OPERATE. UIM COVERAGE IS

01:04:06.275 --> 01:04:07.677
APPLICABLE WHEN OUR DRIVER IS

01:04:07.743 --> 01:04:09.111
NOT AT FAULT FOR AN ACCIDENT.

01:04:09.178 --> 01:04:10.947
THIS BILL DOES NOT ALTER OUR $1

01:04:11.013 --> 01:04:12.148
MILLION LIABILITY COVERAGE,

01:04:12.215 --> 01:04:13.616
WHICH ADDRESSES ACCIDENTS WHERE

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:15.618
A DRIVER IS AT FAULT, AND THIS

01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:18.187
IS ONLY IN SCOPE FOR A SMALL

01:04:18.254 --> 01:04:19.288
FRACTION OF THE TOTAL CLAIMS

01:04:19.355 --> 01:04:21.591
THAT WE SEE ANNUALLY AT THE

01:04:21.657 --> 01:04:23.326
PROPOSED LIMITS. CALIFORNIA

01:04:23.392 --> 01:04:24.894
WOULD STILL MAINTAIN A HIGHER

01:04:24.961 --> 01:04:26.429
REQUIREMENT THAN 40 OTHER STATES

01:04:26.495 --> 01:04:29.298
WHEN IT COMES TO UIM FOR TNCS.

01:04:29.365 --> 01:04:30.766
FURTHERMORE, IT IS NOTABLE THAT

01:04:30.833 --> 01:04:32.168
26 OF THESE STATES DO NOT EVEN

01:04:32.235 --> 01:04:33.970
REQUIRE THIS COVERAGE FOR TNCS,

01:04:34.036 --> 01:04:36.205
AND AS RAMONA STATED EARLIER, NO

01:04:36.272 --> 01:04:37.540
OTHER COMMERCIAL MODE OF

01:04:37.607 --> 01:04:38.608
TRANSPORTATION IN CALIFORNIA IS

01:04:38.674 --> 01:04:39.709
REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THIS

01:04:39.775 --> 01:04:41.877
SPECIFIC TYPE OF INSURANCE. OUR

01:04:41.944 --> 01:04:43.279
REQUEST TODAY IS SIMPLY TO

01:04:43.346 --> 01:04:44.313
MAINTAIN THIS POLICY

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:46.082
REQUIREMENT, BUT AT A LEVEL THAT

01:04:46.148 --> 01:04:47.250
WOULD ADEQUATELY COVER THE

01:04:47.316 --> 01:04:49.285
MAJORITY OF UIM CLAIMS OCCURRING

01:04:49.352 --> 01:04:51.854
ON OUR PLATFORM AND MAKING OUR

01:04:51.921 --> 01:04:55.091
UIM POLICY PRIMARY TO THOSE OF

01:04:55.157 --> 01:04:57.627
PASSENGER UIM COVERAGE. THE

01:04:57.693 --> 01:04:59.795
OBJECTIVE OF THIS LIMIT

01:04:59.862 --> 01:05:01.731
REDUCTION IS NOT TO ACHIEVE A

01:05:01.797 --> 01:05:03.532
WINDFALL, IT'S TO ENHANCE THE

01:05:03.599 --> 01:05:04.367
AFFORDABILITY OF RIDESHARE,

01:05:04.433 --> 01:05:06.035
INCREASE PROFITABILITY FOR

01:05:06.102 --> 01:05:08.137
DRIVERS, AND DISINCENTIVIZE

01:05:08.204 --> 01:05:09.639
OPPORTUNISTIC AND EXAGGERATED

01:05:09.705 --> 01:05:11.040
CLAIMS IN THE MANIPULATIVE

01:05:11.107 --> 01:05:12.408
MANIPULATION OF THE LEGAL

01:05:12.475 --> 01:05:13.509
SYSTEM. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:15.678
AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:17.647
SUPPORT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO

HERE TO RESPECTFULLY EXPRESS OUR

01:06:50.973 --> 01:06:52.641
OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION

01:06:52.708 --> 01:06:55.010
ON SB 371. THIS BILL PROPOSES A

01:06:55.077 --> 01:06:56.112
DRASTIC REDUCTION IN THE

01:06:56.178 --> 01:06:57.213
UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED

01:06:57.279 --> 01:06:58.347
MOTORIST COVERAGE REQUIRED OF

PERSON, OR $300,000 PER

INCIDENT. IT'S A 90% CUT IN

01:07:04.854 --> 01:07:05.888
PROTECTION FOR PASSENGERS AND

01:07:05.955 --> 01:07:07.223

UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED

01:07:08.791 --> 01:07:09.825
MOTORISTS. WE THANK THE

01:07:09.892 --> 01:07:10.926
COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK ON

01:07:10.993 --> 01:07:12.695
IMPROVING THE BILL FROM THE

01:07:12.762 --> 01:07:13.729
LANGUAGE IN PRINT, WHICH WAS

01:07:13.796 --> 01:07:14.930
ORIGINALLY A 95% REDUCTION, BUT

01:07:14.997 --> 01:07:17.032
MORE WORK MUST BE DONE. MAKE NO

01:07:17.099 --> 01:07:18.033
MISTAKE, THIS IS A CORPORATE

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:19.869
WINDFALL AT THE EXPENSE OF REAL

01:07:19.935 --> 01:07:20.503
PEOPLE. CALIFORNIANS WHO RELY

01:07:20.569 --> 01:07:22.171
UPON RIDESHARE SERVICES DESERVE

01:07:22.238 --> 01:07:23.706
TO KNOW THAT IF THEY ARE

01:07:23.773 --> 01:07:25.107
SERIOUSLY INJURED BY RECKLESS OR

01:07:25.174 --> 01:07:26.342
UNINSURED DRIVERS, THEY'LL BE

01:07:26.409 --> 01:07:28.711
COVERED. BUT UNDER SB 371, THEY

01:07:28.778 --> 01:07:30.312
COULD BE LEFT WITH HUNDREDS OF

01:07:30.379 --> 01:07:31.781
THOUSANDS OF MEDICAL BILLS, LOST

01:07:31.847 --> 01:07:32.948
WAGES AND LONG TERM DISABILITY

01:07:33.015 --> 01:07:35.017
WITHOUT MEANINGFUL COMPENSATION.

01:07:35.084 --> 01:07:36.385
THIS BILL ALSO LEAVES DRIVERS

01:07:36.452 --> 01:07:37.620
DANGEROUSLY UNDER-PROTECTED IN

01:07:37.686 --> 01:07:40.055
SERIOUS CRASHES. UNLIKE UIM

01:07:40.122 --> 01:07:41.023
COVERAGE, THE OCCUPATIONAL

01:07:41.090 --> 01:07:42.792
ACCIDENT INSURANCE PROVIDED

01:07:42.858 --> 01:07:45.795
UNDER PROPOSITION 22 EXCLUDES

01:07:45.861 --> 01:07:47.329
COMPENSATION FOR PAIN,

01:07:47.396 --> 01:07:48.964
SUFFERING, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS,

01:07:49.031 --> 01:07:49.999
AND PERMANENT DISABILITY,

01:07:50.065 --> 01:07:51.167
LEAVING DRIVERS WITH ONLY

01:07:51.233 --> 01:07:53.068
PARTIAL COVERAGE AND SUBSTANTIAL

01:07:53.135 --> 01:07:54.837
OUT-OF-POCKET COSTS. MOREOVER,

01:07:54.904 --> 01:07:56.672
UBER'S INSURED DELAYS ACCESS TO

01:07:56.739 --> 01:07:58.841
UIM BENEFITS BY CREATING A

01:07:58.908 --> 01:07:59.475
PROCEDURAL ROADBLOCK AT A TIME

01:07:59.542 --> 01:08:00.709
WHEN UNINSURED DRIVERS AND

01:08:00.776 --> 01:08:02.445
INJURED DRIVERS ARE STRUGGLING

01:08:02.511 --> 01:08:03.779
TO RECOVER PHYSICALLY AND

01:08:03.846 --> 01:08:05.648
FINANCIALLY, THE REDUCTION IN SB

01:08:05.714 --> 01:08:07.450
371 WOULD PLACE DRIVERS IN A

01:08:07.516 --> 01:08:08.551
POSITION WITH FEWER RIGHTS, AND

01:08:08.617 --> 01:08:11.020
NO GUARANTEE THAT ANY CORPORATE

01:08:11.086 --> 01:08:12.188
SAVINGS WILL BE PASSED ALONG FOR

01:08:12.254 --> 01:08:14.190
THEIR BENEFIT. ONE WAY TO REDUCE

01:08:14.256 --> 01:08:16.525
THE HARSH IMPACT OF THE REDUCED

01:08:16.592 --> 01:08:17.426
LIMITS WOULD BE TO MAKE SURE TNC

01:08:17.493 --> 01:08:18.360
DRIVERS AND PASSENGERS CAN

01:08:18.427 --> 01:08:20.095
ACCESS THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE

01:08:20.162 --> 01:08:22.865
TNC. UIM REDUCED $100,000

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:25.267
COVERAGE, IF WARRANTED BY THEIR

01:08:25.334 --> 01:08:27.303
INJURIES, BY ELIMINATING A

01:08:27.369 --> 01:08:28.037
CREDIT AGAINST THE UIM POLICY

01:08:28.103 --> 01:08:30.105
FOR THE AMOUNT OF THE AT FAULT

01:08:30.172 --> 01:08:31.907
DRIVER'S POLICY, UBER RECENTLY

01:08:31.974 --> 01:08:33.275
AGREED TO THIS PROVISION IN THE

01:08:33.342 --> 01:08:34.443
STATE OF VIRGINIA. WE UNDERSTAND

01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:36.212
SEVERAL OTHER STATES ALSO MAKE

01:08:36.278 --> 01:08:37.713
SURE THE FULL VALUE OF THE

01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:38.314
POLICY IS ACCESSIBLE TO TNC

01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:39.482
DRIVERS AND PASSENGERS WHEN

01:08:39.548 --> 01:08:40.416
NEEDED. THIS COVERAGE IS A LOT

01:08:40.483 --> 01:08:43.452
OF NEXT IS NOT A LUXURY. IT'S A

01:08:43.519 --> 01:08:44.353
CRITICAL SAFETY NET, AND THERE

01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:45.788
IS PRECEDENT FOR $1 MILLION IN

01:08:45.855 --> 01:08:47.756
UIM COVERAGE FOR RAIL CREW

01:08:47.823 --> 01:08:48.824
TRANSPORTATION AS ENACTED BY

01:08:48.891 --> 01:08:50.292
THIS BODY TWO YEARS AGO. THANK

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:52.361
YOU. WE URGE OPPOSITION. THANK

01:08:52.428 --> 01:08:54.630
YOU, MADAM CHAIR. MEMBERS SARA

01:08:54.697 --> 01:08:55.865
FLOCKS, CALIFORNIA FEDERATION

01:08:55.931 --> 01:08:58.868
OF. YOU'RE ALSO OPPOSED UNLESS

01:08:58.934 --> 01:09:01.704
AMENDED. AND OUR OPPOSITION

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:03.806
MAINLY IS AROUND. THIS BILL IS

01:09:03.873 --> 01:09:05.708
ABOUT AFFORDABILITY, BUT THERE

01:09:05.774 --> 01:09:08.277
IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THE MONEY

01:09:08.344 --> 01:09:09.545
SAVED BY THE COMPANIES WILL BE

01:09:09.612 --> 01:09:12.014
PASSED ON TO RIDERS OR DRIVERS.

01:09:12.081 --> 01:09:13.249
THERE IS INTENT LANGUAGE, BUT

01:09:13.315 --> 01:09:14.884
THERE IS NOTHING CONCRETE. AND

01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:17.219
THE PROPONENTS SAID THAT NO

01:09:17.286 --> 01:09:19.388
OTHER COMMERCIAL DRIVER HAS THE

01:09:19.455 --> 01:09:21.257
SAME REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY DO,

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:23.292
BUT THEY DIFFER VERY MUCH FROM

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:24.994
OTHER COMMERCIAL COMPANIES.

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:26.929
THERE IS NO COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:28.397
LICENSE THAT IS INSURED AFTER

01:09:28.464 --> 01:09:30.966
PROP 22. THEY ARE STATUTORY

01:09:31.033 --> 01:09:32.268
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS, WHICH

01:09:32.334 --> 01:09:34.069
MEANS THE COMPANY DOES NOT

01:09:34.136 --> 01:09:35.638
PROVIDE WORKERS COMPENSATION.

01:09:35.704 --> 01:09:37.339
THEY DO NOT PROVIDE MINIMUM

01:09:37.406 --> 01:09:39.241
WAGE, THEY DO NOT PROVIDE HEALTH

01:09:39.308 --> 01:09:40.876
BENEFITS, PAY PAYROLL TAXES.

01:09:40.943 --> 01:09:43.178
THEY DO NOT REIMBURSE FOR GAS

01:09:43.245 --> 01:09:45.414
REPAIRS OR THE VEHICLE. THE

01:09:45.481 --> 01:09:47.816
MODEL OF TNCS IS TO FLOOD THE

01:09:47.883 --> 01:09:49.418
MARKET AT SPECIFIC TIMES. THAT'S

01:09:49.485 --> 01:09:51.687
WHY THERE WAS THE USE OF SURGE

01:09:51.754 --> 01:09:52.821
PRICING TO HAVE A FLOOD OF

01:09:52.888 --> 01:09:54.924
DRIVERS AT ONE TIME FLOODING

01:09:54.990 --> 01:09:56.725
CITY STREETS, AS WE'VE SEEN IN

01:09:56.792 --> 01:09:58.527
URBAN AREAS, CREATING TRAFFIC

01:09:58.594 --> 01:10:00.863
AND OTHER HAZARDS AND HIGHER

01:10:00.930 --> 01:10:02.932
RISKS, WHICH INSURANCE MAKES

01:10:02.998 --> 01:10:06.669
SURE IS POOLED. AND SO WE WOULD

01:10:06.735 --> 01:10:08.771
LIKE TO SEE A GUARANTEE THAT

01:10:08.837 --> 01:10:10.873
THIS SAVINGS WILL BE PASSED ON.

01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:12.975
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF THAT IS

01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:15.177
THAT THE COMPANY ENACTED IN

01:10:15.244 --> 01:10:18.080
2022, DYNAMIC PRICING OR UPFRONT

01:10:18.147 --> 01:10:20.215
PRICING. THERE WAS A RECENT

01:10:20.282 --> 01:10:21.250
COLUMBIA SCHOOL OF BUSINESS

01:10:21.317 --> 01:10:23.185
STUDY THAT FOLLOWED A UNIVERSITY

01:10:23.252 --> 01:10:25.220
OF OXFORD STUDY LOOKING AT

01:10:25.287 --> 01:10:26.522
DYNAMIC PRICING, WHICH IS BASED

01:10:26.589 --> 01:10:28.524
ON AN ALGORITHM, WHICH MEANS

01:10:28.591 --> 01:10:31.393
THAT PRICES CAN CHANGE FOR

01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:34.296
DRIVERS AND THE FARE THAT IS

01:10:34.363 --> 01:10:36.398
CHARGED BECOMES DECOUPLED FROM

01:10:36.465 --> 01:10:38.200
WHAT THE RIDER IS PAID OR THE

01:10:38.267 --> 01:10:40.169
DRIVER IS PAID. IN FACT, TWO

01:10:40.235 --> 01:10:42.938
DRIVERS DOING THE EXACT SAME

01:10:43.005 --> 01:10:45.774
FARE CAN BE PAID DIFFERENTLY TO

01:10:45.841 --> 01:10:48.644
RIDERS AS WELL. IN FACT, THE

01:10:48.711 --> 01:10:50.879
STUDY FOUND THAT DRIVER DRIVERS

01:10:50.946 --> 01:10:53.716
TAKE HOME SUBSTANTIALLY

01:10:53.782 --> 01:10:54.717
DECREASED. WHILE UBER IT WAS

01:10:54.783 --> 01:10:56.986
SPECIFIC ON UBER, THEIR TAKE

01:10:57.052 --> 01:10:59.088
HOME OF WHAT THEY WERE CHARGING

01:10:59.154 --> 01:11:00.756
SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED. IT WAS

01:11:00.823 --> 01:11:02.558
THE SAME FINDINGS AT COLUMBIA

01:11:02.625 --> 01:11:04.226
SCHOOL OF BUSINESS AS IT WAS AT

01:11:04.293 --> 01:11:06.462
THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD. THANK

01:11:06.528 --> 01:11:11.000
YOU. SO WE URGE THAT THERE BE A

01:11:11.066 --> 01:11:11.900
GUARANTEE THAT THIS IS PASSED ON

01:11:11.967 --> 01:11:14.203
TO RIDERS AND DRIVERS. THANK

01:11:14.269 --> 01:11:15.604
YOU. WE'LL MOVE ON TO ANY

01:11:15.671 --> 01:11:17.172
ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN

01:11:17.239 --> 01:11:18.207
OPPOSITION. YOU MAY APPROACH THE

01:11:18.273 --> 01:11:19.975
MIC WITH NAME, AFFILIATION AND

01:11:20.042 --> 01:11:21.744

CALIFORNIA. TO BE CLEAR, I THINK

01:11:27.616 --> 01:11:29.184
THERE MAY HAVE BEEN AN ERROR ON

01:11:29.251 --> 01:11:30.719
SUPPORT. WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO

01:11:30.786 --> 01:11:32.554
THE BILL. WE DON'T THINK IT

01:11:32.621 --> 01:11:36.258
REDUCES COSTS FOR AFFORDABILITY

01:11:36.325 --> 01:11:37.359
FOR CONSUMERS OR TO HELP

01:11:37.426 --> 01:11:39.862

MADE BY THE OPPOSITION IN

01:12:37.386 --> 01:12:39.455

01:12:39.521 --> 01:12:42.491
CONCERNS. SURE. WITH THE WITH

01:12:42.558 --> 01:12:45.994
THE CHAIR'S CONCURRENCE. SO A

01:12:46.061 --> 01:12:47.429
COUPLE OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE

01:12:47.496 --> 01:12:49.965
BEEN RAISED. ONE, THE WE HAVE

01:12:50.032 --> 01:12:51.233
BEEN DISCUSSING ALL THESE ISSUES

01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:52.835
WITH OUR FRIENDS AT THE CONSUMER

01:12:52.901 --> 01:12:56.205
ATTORNEYS FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AND

01:12:56.271 --> 01:12:59.408
THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THESE

01:12:59.475 --> 01:13:01.110
VARIOUS KINDS AND TYPES OF, AS

01:13:01.176 --> 01:13:02.211
IT WAS INDICATED BEFORE,

01:13:02.277 --> 01:13:06.081
OVERLAPPING INSURANCES IS PARTLY

01:13:06.148 --> 01:13:07.983
AN ISSUE IN THE BILL. PARTLY IT

01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:09.418
IS THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY

01:13:09.485 --> 01:13:11.286
ITSELF. AND SO I WANT TO BE

01:13:11.353 --> 01:13:12.354
CLEAR, SOME OF THESE

01:13:12.421 --> 01:13:13.822
INTERACTIONS ARE NOT BECAUSE

01:13:13.889 --> 01:13:15.057
UBER AND LYFT HAVE SAID WE'RE

01:13:15.124 --> 01:13:16.558
NOT WE'RE NOT DOING THIS ONE OR

01:13:16.625 --> 01:13:18.427
NOT. AS THESE ISSUES HAVE COME

01:13:18.494 --> 01:13:20.429
FORWARD. WE HAVE BEEN COMMITTED

01:13:20.496 --> 01:13:21.396
TO TRY TO RESOLVE THEM. WE DID

01:13:21.463 --> 01:13:23.332
IN THE FIRST IN THE FIRST ROUND,

01:13:23.398 --> 01:13:26.001
YOU KNOW, THE CASES IN TÍNH

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:27.536
RAISED LIKE, YOU KNOW, WE NEED

01:13:27.603 --> 01:13:30.706
RIGHT NOW. UBER'S POLICY IS NOT

01:13:30.773 --> 01:13:32.841
PRIMARY AND THEREFORE OTHERS

01:13:32.908 --> 01:13:34.676
MIGHT GET EXHAUSTED. FIRST.

01:13:34.743 --> 01:13:36.745
BEFORE YOU GET TO THE UBER

01:13:36.812 --> 01:13:37.346
POLICY, WE'VE WE'VE INCLUDED

01:13:37.412 --> 01:13:39.348
THAT IN THE BILL TO MAKE THAT

01:13:39.414 --> 01:13:41.550
CLEAR. AND SO I THINK WE'RE

01:13:41.617 --> 01:13:42.785
WE'RE STILL TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

01:13:42.851 --> 01:13:44.019
WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS ARE OF

01:13:44.086 --> 01:13:45.754
THE, OF THE OF THE STACKING

01:13:45.821 --> 01:13:47.623
PROPOSAL. WE'RE DEFINITELY OPEN

01:13:47.689 --> 01:13:49.124
TO CONTINUE TALKING ABOUT IT.

01:13:49.191 --> 01:13:50.526
DEFINITELY. AND, AND I SHOULD

01:13:50.592 --> 01:13:52.761
SAY ON THE, ON THE, ON THE, THE

01:13:52.828 --> 01:13:54.263
ISSUES THAT THAT SARAH RAISED.

01:13:54.329 --> 01:13:55.631
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF KEY

01:13:55.697 --> 01:13:58.700
ISSUES AROUND THE, YOU KNOW,

01:13:58.767 --> 01:14:00.302
WORKER RIGHTS OR DRIVER RIGHTS

01:14:00.369 --> 01:14:02.271
AND COMPENSATION IN THE, IN THE

01:14:02.337 --> 01:14:03.939
RIDESHARE MARKETPLACE ARE

01:14:04.006 --> 01:14:07.109
DEFINITELY REAL. THE BILL TRIES

01:14:07.176 --> 01:14:08.544
TO TAKE ON THE SPECIFIC ISSUE

01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:09.578
THAT'S AT HAND, WHICH IS THE

01:14:09.645 --> 01:14:10.479
INSURANCE ISSUES AND ITS

01:14:10.546 --> 01:14:12.114
AFFORDABILITY IMPLICATIONS,

01:14:12.181 --> 01:14:13.916
WITHOUT TRYING TO OCCUPY THE

01:14:13.982 --> 01:14:15.717
FIELD ON ON THESE ON THESE, ON

01:14:15.784 --> 01:14:17.286
THESE OTHER ISSUES FOR DRIVERS,

01:14:17.352 --> 01:14:19.054
THEY'RE NOT REALLY AFFECTED IN,

01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:22.491
IN AND THE LIMITS ARE ABOUT THE

01:14:22.558 --> 01:14:24.059
RIDERS PERSPECTIVE. SO NO MATTER

01:14:24.126 --> 01:14:25.460
WHAT THE LIMITS ARE WE'RE NOT

01:14:25.527 --> 01:14:27.696
IT'S NOT GOING TO PROVIDE

01:14:27.763 --> 01:14:29.031
PENSIONS OR, OR OTHER OR

01:14:29.097 --> 01:14:30.499
BARGAINING RIGHTS OR WHATEVER. I

01:14:30.566 --> 01:14:31.466
KNOW THAT THIS HOUSE HAS PASSED

01:14:31.533 --> 01:14:33.702
ANOTHER BILL IN THAT REGARD, BUT

01:14:33.769 --> 01:14:34.536
THIS BILL IS FOCUSED SOLELY ON

01:14:34.603 --> 01:14:36.605
THE INSURANCE PIECE. AND WE DO

01:14:36.672 --> 01:14:37.573
THINK PUTTING PUTTING MONEY IN

01:14:37.639 --> 01:14:39.808
THE DRIVER'S POCKETS IS A IS A

01:14:39.875 --> 01:14:41.143
BIG STEP FORWARD. THE OTHER

01:14:41.210 --> 01:14:45.881
THING I'LL SAY IS THAT. THE

01:14:45.948 --> 01:14:48.784
INDUSTRY HERE HAS EVERY

01:14:48.851 --> 01:14:52.321
INCENTIVE TO EXECUTE ON WHAT WE

01:14:52.387 --> 01:14:52.955
TALKED ABOUT AT THE OUTSET OF

01:14:53.021 --> 01:14:54.323
THE HEARING, WHICH IS THE

01:14:54.389 --> 01:14:55.791
AFFORDABILITY PURPOSE. SO I

01:14:55.858 --> 01:14:57.092
SHARE, YOU KNOW, THE CONCERNS,

01:14:57.159 --> 01:14:58.427
LIKE HOW DO WE KNOW THIS IS

01:14:58.493 --> 01:15:00.329
REALLY GOING TO HAPPEN? AND THE

01:15:00.395 --> 01:15:02.164
CHAIR AND I HAVE HAD EXTENSIVE

01:15:02.231 --> 01:15:02.931
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS AS WELL

01:15:02.998 --> 01:15:04.600
AS WELL AS EVERYONE ELSE BECAUSE

01:15:04.666 --> 01:15:05.801
LIKE WE'RE DOING SOMETHING BIG

01:15:05.868 --> 01:15:08.303
AND IMPORTANT. IF WE ARE ABLE TO

01:15:08.370 --> 01:15:08.971
GET THIS, GET THIS ACCOMPLISHED,

01:15:09.037 --> 01:15:10.672
BUT WE WANT TO KNOW THAT IT'S

01:15:10.739 --> 01:15:11.974
GOING TO ACTUALLY RESULT IN

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:13.842
REDUCED FARES AND, AND BETTER,

01:15:13.909 --> 01:15:15.210
BETTER COMPENSATION FOR DRIVERS,

01:15:15.277 --> 01:15:18.480
I THINK. AND IT'S NOT SO SIMPLE

01:15:18.547 --> 01:15:20.449
BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A PRICE

01:15:20.515 --> 01:15:22.050
REGULATED INDUSTRY. YOU KNOW,

01:15:22.117 --> 01:15:24.119
LIKE WHEN WE VOTE TO DO

01:15:24.186 --> 01:15:25.520
MINISTERIAL SEQUA FOR HOUSING,

01:15:25.587 --> 01:15:27.155
LIKE WE CAN'T WE CAN'T DEMAND

01:15:27.222 --> 01:15:28.824
THAT YOU THAT YOU CHANGE YOUR

01:15:28.891 --> 01:15:30.225
HOUSING PRICING ME BY SAYING I

01:15:30.292 --> 01:15:32.127
THOUGHT IT MIGHT I MEAN, THAT'S

01:15:32.194 --> 01:15:35.264
I MEAN THAT'S A CONSTANTLY A

01:15:35.330 --> 01:15:36.832
CHALLENGE FOR US HERE. LET'S NOT

01:15:36.899 --> 01:15:39.534
TALK ABOUT SEQUA AS WE.

01:15:39.601 --> 01:15:41.136
ULTIMATELY SENATOR, I THINK THAT

01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:42.671
BUT I WAS GOING TO SAY SO. BUT

01:15:42.738 --> 01:15:44.973
BUT IN THIS CASE, THE ECONOMIC

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:46.775
INCENTIVES ARE EXACTLY ALIGNED.

01:15:46.842 --> 01:15:49.611
SO IT'S NOT THE ANSWER TO THE

01:15:49.678 --> 01:15:50.212
QUESTION, BUT I DO THINK IT

01:15:50.279 --> 01:15:52.514
PROVIDES THE IN THAT THE

01:15:52.581 --> 01:15:53.849
RIDESHARE MARKETPLACE RIGHT NOW

01:15:53.916 --> 01:15:57.185
IS SUFFERING FROM AN INADEQUATE

01:15:57.252 --> 01:15:59.421
NUMBER OF DRIVERS COSTS THAT ARE

01:15:59.488 --> 01:16:01.623
CAUSING RIDER RIDERS TO, TO

01:16:01.690 --> 01:16:03.325
PURSUE OTHER OPTIONS OR JUST NOT

01:16:03.392 --> 01:16:06.528
TO, TO TAKE A TRIP. AND SO IT IS

01:16:06.595 --> 01:16:07.596
ABSOLUTELY THIS THIS CAN'T GO ON

01:16:07.663 --> 01:16:10.198
THIS WAY. SO THE RIDESHARE

01:16:10.265 --> 01:16:12.000
COMPANIES, THEIR ABSOLUTE

01:16:12.067 --> 01:16:13.902
ECONOMIC INTEREST IS IN IS IN

01:16:13.969 --> 01:16:16.271
LOWER FARES AND IN PAY THAT WILL

01:16:16.338 --> 01:16:17.639
ATTRACT DRIVERS AS WELL. SO THE

01:16:17.706 --> 01:16:19.141
INCENTIVES ARE RIGHT. WE HAVE

01:16:19.207 --> 01:16:22.344
HAD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT EVEN

01:16:22.411 --> 01:16:24.279
THOUGH WE CAN'T SET THE PRICE IN

01:16:24.346 --> 01:16:25.747
STATUTE, COULD WE YOU KNOW,

01:16:25.814 --> 01:16:27.382
COULD WE DO A LOOK BACK IN A

01:16:27.449 --> 01:16:30.018
COUPLE OF YEARS LIKE DID DID IT

01:16:30.085 --> 01:16:31.486
ACTUALLY DO WHAT WE SAID WE WERE

01:16:31.553 --> 01:16:33.155
GOING TO DO? THE LANGUAGE THAT

01:16:33.221 --> 01:16:34.222
CAME HERE THAT WE ACCEPTED AS

01:16:34.289 --> 01:16:35.357
AUTHORS AMENDMENTS OUT OF THE

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:36.858
INSURANCE COMMITTEE DOESN'T

01:16:36.925 --> 01:16:38.026
QUITE GET THERE, BUT WE BUT BUT

01:16:38.093 --> 01:16:40.062
I BUT I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE WILL

01:16:40.128 --> 01:16:40.629
FIND MECHANISMS TO HOLD THE

01:16:40.696 --> 01:16:42.130
COMPANIES AND OURSELVES

01:16:42.197 --> 01:16:44.900
ACCOUNTABLE. JUST JUST TO WRAP

01:16:44.967 --> 01:16:49.771
UP, MADAM CHAIR, I DOES APPEAR.

01:16:49.838 --> 01:16:52.240
THAT THE THESE AFFORDABILITY

01:16:52.307 --> 01:16:53.275
CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN

01:16:53.342 --> 01:16:56.244
HAVING, HAVING AND COMMITTEES

01:16:56.311 --> 01:16:58.080
FOR THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS TO

01:16:58.146 --> 01:16:59.448
ADDRESS THE AFFORDABILITY CRISIS

01:16:59.514 --> 01:17:01.917
IN CALIFORNIA CONTINUE TO ELUDE

01:17:01.984 --> 01:17:04.886
THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE IT FEELS

01:17:04.953 --> 01:17:07.389
THAT AS A FRESHMAN MEMBER, EVERY

01:17:07.456 --> 01:17:09.224
TIME WE WANT TO HAVE

01:17:09.291 --> 01:17:10.325
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

01:17:10.392 --> 01:17:11.827
AFFORDABILITY THAT HAS BEEN

01:17:11.893 --> 01:17:13.395
ASKED OF BY THE SPEAKER IN HIS

01:17:13.462 --> 01:17:15.097
OPENING ADDRESS THAT THE

01:17:15.163 --> 01:17:16.465
LEGISLATURE FOCUSED ON

01:17:16.531 --> 01:17:17.499
AFFORDABILITY, EVERY

01:17:17.566 --> 01:17:19.601
AFFORDABILITY CONVERSATION IS

01:17:19.668 --> 01:17:23.271
MET WITH FIERCE DISAGREEMENT

01:17:23.338 --> 01:17:27.142
FROM EVERY COMMITTEE, VIRTUALLY

01:17:27.209 --> 01:17:28.944
AND EVERY ISSUE. AND I DO THINK

01:17:29.011 --> 01:17:32.014
THAT WE NEED TO BE LASER FOCUSED

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:34.750
ON ON THAT. IT'S CERTAINLY WHY I

01:17:34.816 --> 01:17:37.753
CAME TO SACRAMENTO, BUT WE HAVE

01:17:37.819 --> 01:17:40.889
TO BE HAVING DEEPER AND HARDER

01:17:40.956 --> 01:17:42.357
CONVERSATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS

01:17:42.424 --> 01:17:44.092
ABOUT HOW WE ACHIEVE THAT. I

01:17:44.159 --> 01:17:48.030
WILL SAY THAT I KNOW THAT THIS

01:17:48.096 --> 01:17:52.834
BILL IS NOT PERFECT, AND IT

01:17:52.901 --> 01:17:54.636
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE BEEN IN

01:17:54.703 --> 01:17:56.271
ACTIVE NEGOTIATION AND HAVE

01:17:56.338 --> 01:17:59.975
TAKEN AMENDMENTS TO CONTINUE TO

01:18:00.042 --> 01:18:02.010
CLARIFY AND TRY TO ADDRESS THESE

01:18:02.077 --> 01:18:04.112
ISSUES. AS A MEMBER REPRESENTING

01:18:04.179 --> 01:18:05.380
THE HEART OF SILICON VALLEY,

01:18:05.447 --> 01:18:07.349
WHERE A LOT OF THIS INNOVATION

01:18:07.416 --> 01:18:08.950
IS BORN OUT OF, I THINK IT'S

01:18:09.017 --> 01:18:10.786
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT SORT

01:18:10.852 --> 01:18:12.654
OF WE HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE

01:18:12.721 --> 01:18:13.755
IN THESE CONVERSATIONS, WOULD

01:18:13.822 --> 01:18:16.224
LIKE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH

01:18:16.291 --> 01:18:20.128
YOU ON THESE ISSUES. SO AND I

01:18:20.195 --> 01:18:22.064
WOULD LIKE TO SEE HOW WE CAN

01:18:22.130 --> 01:18:23.231
FURTHER ADDRESS THE CONCERNS

01:18:23.298 --> 01:18:26.301
ALONG THE WAY, BECAUSE I'M

01:18:26.368 --> 01:18:28.136
BUCKLING UP FOR THE END OF

01:18:28.203 --> 01:18:29.471
SESSION, MY FIRST END OF

01:18:29.538 --> 01:18:30.672
SESSION. SO WITH THAT BEING

01:18:30.739 --> 01:18:33.075
SAID, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF I

01:18:33.141 --> 01:18:34.142
CAN HELP BROKER THESE

01:18:34.209 --> 01:18:35.310
CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU

01:18:35.377 --> 01:18:37.179
REPRESENTING SILICON VALLEY AND

01:18:37.245 --> 01:18:39.147
WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A

01:18:39.214 --> 01:18:40.615
COAUTHOR AT THE NEXT AVAILABLE

01:18:40.682 --> 01:18:42.517
OPPORTUNITY, BECAUSE I DO THINK

01:18:42.584 --> 01:18:44.519
I WOULD LIKE TO HELP ADDRESS THE

01:18:44.586 --> 01:18:47.556
ISSUES RAISED. AND WHILE TRYING

01:18:47.622 --> 01:18:50.158
TO, YOU KNOW, ADDRESS THE INTENT

01:18:50.225 --> 01:18:53.028
OF THE BILL AS WELL. THANK YOU.

01:18:53.095 --> 01:18:53.929
ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROGERS AND

01:18:53.995 --> 01:18:56.398
ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA, THANK YOU

01:18:56.465 --> 01:18:58.266
SO MUCH. AND I THINK MY

01:18:58.333 --> 01:18:59.501
COLLEAGUE HIT IT ON THE HEAD

01:18:59.568 --> 01:19:02.104
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

01:19:02.170 --> 01:19:03.638
AFFORDABILITY. AND IT'S THE

01:19:03.705 --> 01:19:04.773
INEVITABLE QUESTION IS

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:07.242
AFFORDABLE FOR WHO ALSO AND SO

01:19:07.309 --> 01:19:08.777
I, I KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN GETTING

01:19:08.844 --> 01:19:10.479
THIS QUESTION IN EVERY SINGLE

01:19:10.545 --> 01:19:13.381
COMMITTEE ABOUT HOW CAN WE PROVE

01:19:13.448 --> 01:19:16.651
THAT THE MONEY GOES BACK TO THE

01:19:16.718 --> 01:19:18.854
DRIVERS OR GOES BACK INTO THE

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:21.323
POCKETS OF CONSUMERS? I'M

01:19:21.389 --> 01:19:23.191
HEARING A COMMITMENT FROM YOU TO

01:19:23.258 --> 01:19:24.593
FIGURE THAT PIECE OUT, AND NOT

01:19:24.659 --> 01:19:26.761
JUST IN THE INTENT LANGUAGE, BUT

01:19:26.828 --> 01:19:27.596
SOMETHING THAT'S ACTUALLY BUILT

01:19:27.662 --> 01:19:30.632
INTO THE STATUTE THAT GIVES SOME

01:19:30.699 --> 01:19:31.900
CREDIBILITY TO THE CLAIM THAT

01:19:31.967 --> 01:19:34.069
THIS IS GOING TO MAKE THINGS

01:19:34.136 --> 01:19:34.970
CHEAPER FOR FOLKS. THAT'S WHAT

01:19:35.036 --> 01:19:38.106
I'VE HEARD FROM YOU. THE OTHER

01:19:38.173 --> 01:19:42.544
QUESTION THAT I HAVE IS ONE, AND

01:19:42.611 --> 01:19:43.645
I'LL ASK THIS FROM BOTH THE

01:19:43.712 --> 01:19:45.046
SUPPORTERS AND THE OPPONENTS,

01:19:45.113 --> 01:19:46.982
THE ORIGINAL INTENT IN PUTTING

01:19:47.048 --> 01:19:50.652
THIS REQUIREMENT INTO LAW. ONE,

01:19:50.719 --> 01:19:52.320
FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE, WHAT WHY

01:19:52.387 --> 01:19:55.123
WAS THAT PUT IN? AND TWO, HAS

01:19:55.190 --> 01:19:57.092
THAT BEEN RESOLVED? HAVE THOSE

01:19:57.159 --> 01:19:58.059
CONCERNS OR THE REASON THAT THAT

01:19:58.126 --> 01:19:59.661
WAS PUT IN PLACE BEEN RESOLVED?

01:19:59.728 --> 01:20:02.063
AND I KNOW THAT SOME OF IT IS

01:20:02.130 --> 01:20:03.431
JUST BECAUSE THIS WAS AN

01:20:03.498 --> 01:20:04.065
EMERGENCY, AN EMERGING MARKET,

01:20:04.132 --> 01:20:09.304
AND PEOPLE THREW REGULATIONS IN.

01:20:09.371 --> 01:20:12.474
WELL, I WOULD SAY SO. SO IT WAS

01:20:12.541 --> 01:20:14.176
AN EMERGENCY MARKET AND

01:20:14.242 --> 01:20:16.044
REGULATIONS. I MEAN, I DON'T I

01:20:16.111 --> 01:20:17.479
DON'T MEAN AT ALL TO DEMEAN OUR,

01:20:17.546 --> 01:20:19.114
OUR PREDECESSORS. THEY WORKED

01:20:19.181 --> 01:20:21.583
REALLY HARD TO TRY TO GET THIS

01:20:21.650 --> 01:20:22.250
RIGHT WITH VERY LITTLE

01:20:22.317 --> 01:20:23.985
INFORMATION AND TRYING TO TRYING

01:20:24.052 --> 01:20:26.054
TO FIGURE IT OUT. AND SO AND

01:20:26.121 --> 01:20:27.722
IT'S NOT AS THOUGH THE

01:20:27.789 --> 01:20:28.390
LEGISLATURE HASN'T DEALT WITH IT

01:20:28.456 --> 01:20:29.324
SINCE THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE WAS

01:20:29.391 --> 01:20:31.860
NOT A MAJOR AREA OF FOCUS

01:20:31.927 --> 01:20:33.361
BECAUSE THESE, THESE, THESE

01:20:33.428 --> 01:20:35.030
LIMITS, WHICH WERE, YOU KNOW,

01:20:35.096 --> 01:20:36.298
THE FIRST AND ONE OF THE HIGHEST

01:20:36.364 --> 01:20:38.700
IN THE COUNTRY, WERE ALREADY

01:20:38.767 --> 01:20:41.970
PART OF THE POLICY, BECAUSE IF I

01:20:42.037 --> 01:20:44.306
THINK YOU'RE ALL YOU MAY BE ALL

01:20:44.372 --> 01:20:45.340
TOO YOUNG TO REMEMBER THIS WHEN

01:20:45.407 --> 01:20:47.409
THE MARKET STARTED. YEAH I KNOW,

01:20:47.475 --> 01:20:48.777
YEAH. SO, YOU KNOW,

01:20:48.843 --> 01:20:52.247
UNFORTUNATELY I WAS NOT NONE OF

01:20:52.314 --> 01:20:55.283
US, NOBODY THAT WASN'T A RISK

01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:56.751
LOVING COLLEGE STUDENT WANTED TO

01:20:56.818 --> 01:20:58.587
GET IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S VEHICLE.

01:20:58.653 --> 01:21:01.089
SO I KNOW FOR ME, I'M LIKE, I

01:21:01.156 --> 01:21:02.424
NEED TO SEE $25 BILLION WORTH OF

01:21:02.490 --> 01:21:04.159
INSURANCE BEFORE I GET IT. AND,

01:21:04.226 --> 01:21:04.726
YOU KNOW, THAT WAS TOTALLY

01:21:04.793 --> 01:21:06.695
HUMAN. AND SO THE IT WAS IN THE

01:21:06.761 --> 01:21:08.530
COMPANY'S INTEREST AT THAT TIME

01:21:08.597 --> 01:21:09.998
TO MAXIMIZE THEIR INSURANCE

01:21:10.065 --> 01:21:12.400
COVERAGE, NOT ONLY FOR PUC AND

01:21:12.467 --> 01:21:13.201
LEGISLATIVE REGULATION, BUT

01:21:13.268 --> 01:21:14.636
BECAUSE NOBODY WOULD RIDE

01:21:14.703 --> 01:21:16.438
OTHERWISE. AND SO SINCE THAT

01:21:16.504 --> 01:21:19.474
TIME, WE NOW HAVE ACTUAL DATA ON

01:21:19.541 --> 01:21:21.076
ACCIDENTS, ON FAULTS, ON CLAIMS,

01:21:21.142 --> 01:21:23.178
ON OUTCOMES OF THOSE CLAIMS. SO

01:21:23.245 --> 01:21:24.613
I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S THAT'S

01:21:24.679 --> 01:21:26.047
WHAT'S DIFFERENT HERE IS NOW NOW

01:21:26.114 --> 01:21:28.183
WE KNOW THAT NOW THERE ARE THIS

01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:29.718
THESE LIMITS WOULD COVER THE

01:21:29.784 --> 01:21:31.386
VAST MAJORITY OF THE CLAIMS, BUT

01:21:31.453 --> 01:21:32.220
THERE ARE CLAIMS THAT ARE

01:21:32.287 --> 01:21:34.389
HIGHER. AND SO I WANT TO, YOU

01:21:34.456 --> 01:21:35.857
KNOW, IF I CAN ADDRESS THAT

01:21:35.924 --> 01:21:38.226
PIECE OF IT. SO BUT THE DATA

01:21:38.293 --> 01:21:39.628
TELLS US A COUPLE OF THINGS

01:21:39.694 --> 01:21:41.930
ABOUT THOSE CLAIMS THAT SOME OF

01:21:41.997 --> 01:21:43.465
THEM ARE ARE DRAMATICALLY

01:21:43.531 --> 01:21:44.966
HIGHER. AND ONE OF MY FIRST

01:21:45.033 --> 01:21:46.501
QUESTIONS WHEN WE GOT INTO THIS

01:21:46.568 --> 01:21:48.236
WORK WAS, WELL, YOU KNOW, WHO'S

01:21:48.303 --> 01:21:49.671
GOING TO COVER THOSE COSTS THEN,

01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:53.108
RIGHT? YOU KNOW, ARE WE LEAVING

01:21:53.174 --> 01:21:54.909
SOMEBODY WITHOUT THE MEDICAL

01:21:54.976 --> 01:21:55.410
COVERAGE, THE PAIN AND

01:21:55.477 --> 01:21:56.578
SUFFERING, WHAT THEY WHAT THEY

01:21:56.645 --> 01:21:58.013
NEED AND WHAT THEY DESERVE AND

01:21:58.079 --> 01:21:59.614
WHAT BECAME CLEAR, JUST, YOU

01:21:59.681 --> 01:22:01.149
KNOW, STARTING TO LOOK AT IT

01:22:01.216 --> 01:22:02.917
DIRECTLY. YOU GO YOU GO SEARCH

01:22:02.984 --> 01:22:04.653
FOR, YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW, I GOT

01:22:04.719 --> 01:22:06.221
AN UBER ACCIDENT, A WHOLE BUNCH

01:22:06.288 --> 01:22:09.291
OF WEBSITES POP UP OF, OF LAW

01:22:09.357 --> 01:22:10.592
FIRMS THAT ARE LIKE, HEY, HERE'S

01:22:10.659 --> 01:22:12.627
A THERE'S A SPECIAL LAW JUST FOR

01:22:12.694 --> 01:22:14.095
UBER. AND, YOU KNOW, BRING YOUR

01:22:14.162 --> 01:22:15.930
CASE TO US. WE HAVE OUR OWN

01:22:15.997 --> 01:22:17.666
DOCTORS. RIGHT. AND WHAT WHAT WE

01:22:17.732 --> 01:22:20.468
WERE SEEING IS A LOT OF THESE

01:22:20.535 --> 01:22:21.603
CASES AT THE UPPER END, IT

01:22:21.670 --> 01:22:22.404
WASN'T THAT THE DAMAGES WERE

01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:24.506
WERE MORE THE YOU KNOW, THE

01:22:24.572 --> 01:22:26.274
ACTUAL ACCIDENT WAS WORSE WAS

01:22:26.341 --> 01:22:28.610
THAT THE REFERRALS WERE TO

01:22:28.677 --> 01:22:30.645
SOMEBODY OTHER THAN YOUR DOCTOR

01:22:30.712 --> 01:22:32.380
FROM, YOU KNOW, FROM SUTTER OR

01:22:32.447 --> 01:22:33.782
UC DAVIS OR, YOU KNOW, RATHER

01:22:33.848 --> 01:22:35.317
THAN YOU GOING TO YOUR DOCTOR

01:22:35.383 --> 01:22:36.351
USING YOUR REGULAR MEDICAL

01:22:36.418 --> 01:22:38.553
COVERAGE WITH THE PRICE AND

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:39.921
PRICES THAT HAVE BEEN

01:22:39.988 --> 01:22:40.689
NEGOTIATED, THAT YOU WOULD THEN

01:22:40.755 --> 01:22:42.824
BE DIVERTED TO A DIFFERENT

01:22:42.891 --> 01:22:44.426
MEDICAL PROVIDER THAT MAYBE

01:22:44.492 --> 01:22:46.227
DIDN'T HAVE THE INCENTIVES TO BE

01:22:46.294 --> 01:22:47.662
IN THAT MARKET. SO WHEN WE LOOK

01:22:47.729 --> 01:22:49.564
AT THE REALLY HIGH CLAIMS FROM

01:22:49.631 --> 01:22:51.499
THE DATA, IT'S A NON-TRIVIAL

01:22:51.566 --> 01:22:52.067
AMOUNT OF THOSE CLAIMS ARE

01:22:52.133 --> 01:22:53.735
HIGHER BECAUSE OF HOW KIND OF

01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:55.136
HOW BROKEN THAT PART OF THE

01:22:55.203 --> 01:22:57.172
SYSTEM IS. AND SO I THINK IN

01:22:57.238 --> 01:22:58.373
BOTH CASES, THE DATA SHOWS US

01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:00.308
THAT, THAT NEARLY ALL THE CLAIMS

01:23:00.375 --> 01:23:01.910
THAT AREN'T IN THAT CATEGORY ARE

01:23:01.976 --> 01:23:03.878
COVERED BY THESE, BY THESE

01:23:03.945 --> 01:23:05.146
LIMITS, THAT NOW WE CAN BE

01:23:05.213 --> 01:23:06.514
COMFORTABLE LOOKING AT THE

01:23:06.581 --> 01:23:07.749
HISTOGRAM OF WHERE THE RIGHT

01:23:07.816 --> 01:23:09.818
POINT IS TO GET THE RIGHT

01:23:09.884 --> 01:23:10.552
BALANCE BETWEEN COST TO THE

01:23:10.618 --> 01:23:12.287
DRIVER, TO THE TO THE CONSUMER,

01:23:12.354 --> 01:23:14.889
AND ASSURING THAT WE'RE FULLY

01:23:14.956 --> 01:23:16.491
PROTECTING THEM IN THE EVENT OF

01:23:16.558 --> 01:23:18.493
A OF AN ACCIDENT. AND IF I COULD

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:20.595
ADD A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT TO,

01:23:20.662 --> 01:23:22.063
TO SOME OF THE ABUSE THAT THE

01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:24.232
SENATOR IS REFERENCING, OUR

01:23:24.299 --> 01:23:26.000
UNDERWRITER FOR THE STATE OF

01:23:26.067 --> 01:23:26.668
CALIFORNIA HAD DONE A STUDY WHEN

01:23:26.735 --> 01:23:28.937
WE WERE ORIGINALLY LOOKING AT

01:23:29.003 --> 01:23:31.039
REFORMS. WHAT WHAT IS

01:23:31.106 --> 01:23:32.440
REASONABLE? HOW DO HOW DO WE GET

01:23:32.507 --> 01:23:34.242
THERE? AND FOR INDIVIDUAL

01:23:34.309 --> 01:23:35.610
POLICIES, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:23:35.677 --> 01:23:37.278
ROGERS, LIKE YOU OR I, DRIVING

01:23:37.345 --> 01:23:39.314
ON THE ROAD AT THE 50,000 PER

01:23:39.381 --> 01:23:40.582
PERSON, 100,000 PER ACCIDENT

01:23:40.648 --> 01:23:42.283
THAT WAS RECOMMENDED, THAT WOULD

01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:44.786
COVER 96% OF CASES FOR

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:46.154
INDIVIDUAL PARTIES, NOT TNC

01:23:46.221 --> 01:23:49.057
TRIPS. THEY ALSO FOUND THAT

01:23:49.124 --> 01:23:51.693
CLAIMS WERE OFTEN INFLATED 10 TO

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:54.229
12 TIMES INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS FROM

01:23:54.295 --> 01:23:55.330
OUR UNDERWRITER, AND I'M HAPPY

01:23:55.397 --> 01:23:57.298
TO SHARE THAT STUDY. WE ALSO

01:23:57.365 --> 01:23:58.800
WORKED WITH LYFT JOINTLY, AND WE

01:23:58.867 --> 01:24:00.101
COMMISSIONED A STUDY, A THIRD

01:24:00.168 --> 01:24:02.003
PARTY STUDY BY THE BERKELEY

01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:02.637
RESEARCH GROUP. WE ARE HAPPY TO

01:24:02.704 --> 01:24:04.939
SHARE THAT WITH YOU AS WELL. BUT

01:24:05.006 --> 01:24:06.374
WANTING TO PUT A FINER POINT ON

01:24:06.441 --> 01:24:07.709
ON THOSE ABUSES AND SOME OF

01:24:07.776 --> 01:24:09.978
THOSE COSTS, AND WE HEAR YOU IN

01:24:10.044 --> 01:24:11.980
THIS COMMITTEE ON THE FEEDBACK

01:24:12.046 --> 01:24:14.416
FOR HOW CAN THINGS BE CONCRETE

01:24:14.482 --> 01:24:16.785
TODAY ON AN UBER RIDE ON A

01:24:16.851 --> 01:24:17.886
RECEIPT? THE BOOKING FEE

01:24:17.952 --> 01:24:19.087
REPRESENTS THE INSURANCE COSTS.

01:24:19.154 --> 01:24:20.955
SO WHEN IT COMES TO LOOKING AT

01:24:21.022 --> 01:24:22.524
THE WAYS THAT THIS POLICY

01:24:22.590 --> 01:24:24.392
CHANGES THE MARKETPLACE AND THE

01:24:24.459 --> 01:24:25.794
LOOKBACK STUDY THAT'S IN FRONT

01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:27.962
OF YOU TODAY, THAT DATA WILL BE

01:24:28.029 --> 01:24:29.497
INCORPORATED, AND WE'RE OPEN TO

01:24:29.564 --> 01:24:30.565
FEEDBACK ON ADDITIONAL WAYS TO

01:24:30.632 --> 01:24:32.434
HAVE GUARANTEES THAT MAKE THIS

01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:33.034
COMMITTEE COMFORTABLE. BUT I

01:24:33.101 --> 01:24:35.136
THINK THAT CONTEXT IS HELPFUL.

01:24:35.203 --> 01:24:39.574
NICK. AND IF I MAY, TO YOUR TO

01:24:39.641 --> 01:24:40.375
YOUR QUESTION ABOUT WHAT HAVE WE

01:24:40.442 --> 01:24:42.076
SORRY, WHAT HAVE WE, MR.

01:24:42.143 --> 01:24:43.077
JOHNSON? YEAH. GO AHEAD. WHAT

01:24:43.144 --> 01:24:45.013
DOES GO DOWN THE LINE. WE'LL

01:24:45.079 --> 01:24:46.281
JUST GO DOWN THE LINE. IT'LL BE

01:24:46.347 --> 01:24:48.483
NICK, CASEY. SARAH. YES. SO, YOU

01:24:48.550 --> 01:24:50.318
KNOW, I THINK THE OTHER STATES

01:24:50.385 --> 01:24:51.386
LEARNED PRETTY QUICKLY. RIGHT.

01:24:51.453 --> 01:24:53.822
AND SO, JUST AS SENATOR CABALDON

01:24:53.888 --> 01:24:55.390
SAID, CALIFORNIA WAS THE FIRST

01:24:55.457 --> 01:24:57.392
TO DO THIS, AND IT WAS A LOFTY

01:24:57.459 --> 01:24:59.561
JOB TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BUILD

01:24:59.627 --> 01:25:01.763
PUBLIC TRUST WITH THIS NEW

01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:03.698
INDUSTRY. AND ONCE THESE LIMITS

01:25:03.765 --> 01:25:06.267
WERE PUT IN, ESSENTIALLY ALL THE

01:25:06.334 --> 01:25:07.902
OTHER STATES STARTED TO FOLLOW

01:25:07.969 --> 01:25:09.270
SUIT. BUT ONE THING THAT WAS

01:25:09.337 --> 01:25:12.941
MISSING WAS THE $1 MILLION UIM

01:25:13.007 --> 01:25:14.342
REQUIREMENT FROM FOR THE VAST

01:25:14.409 --> 01:25:15.810
MAJORITY OF STATES. THERE'S

01:25:15.877 --> 01:25:18.046
OTHER LEVELS THERE, BUT THERE'S

01:25:18.112 --> 01:25:19.881
ONLY FOUR OTHER STATES THAT HAVE

01:25:19.948 --> 01:25:21.583
THIS $1 MILLION POLICY. SO I

01:25:21.649 --> 01:25:24.452
THINK THE CHANGES HAPPENED QUITE

01:25:24.519 --> 01:25:25.587
QUICKLY ONCE OTHER STATES

01:25:25.653 --> 01:25:27.622
STARTED TO INTRODUCE THIS

01:25:27.689 --> 01:25:28.756
LEGISLATION, THAT THEY SAW THAT

01:25:28.823 --> 01:25:31.025
THIS AT LEAST THIS SPECIFIC

01:25:31.092 --> 01:25:33.628
PIECE OF INSURANCE, DIDN'T NEED

01:25:33.695 --> 01:25:38.933
TO HAVE A LIMIT OF $1 MILLION.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:42.570
YEAH. I MEAN, I THINK THE ANSWER

01:25:42.637 --> 01:25:44.639
IS WE DON'T KNOW ENTIRELY STILL

01:25:44.706 --> 01:25:46.474
AND ALL THERE'S BEEN

01:25:46.541 --> 01:25:47.842
REPRESENTATION ABOUT DATA THAT

01:25:47.909 --> 01:25:50.245
EXISTS. THERE'S STILL DATA THAT

01:25:50.311 --> 01:25:53.281
I KNOW THAT'S BEEN REQUESTED BY

01:25:53.348 --> 01:25:54.849
OUR SIDE BY THE CONSUMER

01:25:54.916 --> 01:25:56.484
ATTORNEYS AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF

01:25:56.551 --> 01:25:57.385
LEGISLATORS THAT HASN'T BEEN

01:25:57.452 --> 01:25:58.987
PROVIDED YET. A REPORT

01:25:59.053 --> 01:25:59.787
SUMMARIZING DATA ISN'T THE

01:25:59.854 --> 01:26:01.656
ACTUAL DATA. SO I THINK THAT'S

01:26:01.723 --> 01:26:02.457
ONE QUESTION. THE OTHER QUESTION

01:26:02.524 --> 01:26:04.325
IS WITH RESPECT TO UNDERINSURED,

01:26:04.392 --> 01:26:05.860
UNINSURED MOTORIST COVERAGE,

01:26:05.927 --> 01:26:07.595
IT'S ONE OF THE MOST AFFORDABLE

01:26:07.662 --> 01:26:09.130
THINGS THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE FOR

01:26:09.197 --> 01:26:10.532
YOURSELF AND TO PROVIDE

01:26:10.598 --> 01:26:12.000
INSURANCE AND PROTECTION FOR

01:26:12.066 --> 01:26:13.668
YOURSELF. AND IF YOU'RE TO LOOK

01:26:13.735 --> 01:26:15.036
AT YOUR OWN INSURANCE POLICY,

01:26:15.103 --> 01:26:16.638
YOU'LL SEE THAT THE LARGEST

01:26:16.704 --> 01:26:17.972
PERCENTAGE OF WHAT YOU PAID

01:26:18.039 --> 01:26:19.440
INSURANCE FOR YOUR AUTOMOBILE IS

01:26:19.507 --> 01:26:21.976
FOR YOUR LIABILITY COVERAGE,

01:26:22.043 --> 01:26:25.346
WHICH KICKS IN IF YOU CAUSE AN

01:26:25.413 --> 01:26:26.714
ACCIDENT. THE OTHER HIGHER RATES

01:26:26.781 --> 01:26:28.149
ARE FOR THE COLLISION AND THE

01:26:28.216 --> 01:26:28.950
COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE. THAT'S

01:26:29.017 --> 01:26:30.618
THE DAMAGE TO VEHICLES. AND CARS

01:26:30.685 --> 01:26:32.520
HAVE GOTTEN REALLY EXPENSIVE. SO

01:26:32.587 --> 01:26:33.655
THOSE COSTS ARE REAL HIGH. IF

01:26:33.721 --> 01:26:36.090
YOU LOOK AT THE ACTUAL COST OF

01:26:36.157 --> 01:26:36.758
THE PREMIUM FOR UNINSURED

01:26:36.824 --> 01:26:38.226
UNDERINSURED MOTORIST COVERAGE,

01:26:38.293 --> 01:26:40.061
IT USUALLY REPRESENTS LESS THAN

01:26:40.128 --> 01:26:41.930
10% OF YOUR ENTIRE PREMIUM. AND

01:26:41.996 --> 01:26:43.131
SO TO PROVIDE THAT EXTRA

01:26:43.197 --> 01:26:44.599
PROTECTION FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S

01:26:44.666 --> 01:26:48.102
USING A TRANSPORTATION NETWORK

01:26:48.169 --> 01:26:50.038
PROVIDER, IT'S A BARGAIN AS

01:26:50.104 --> 01:26:54.008
OPPOSED TO PUTTING THE COST BACK

01:26:54.075 --> 01:26:55.843
ON, YOU KNOW, GOVERNMENT

01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:58.246
INSURANCE FOR CHARGES THAT

01:26:58.313 --> 01:27:01.416
AREN'T OTHERWISE COVERED. AND

01:27:01.482 --> 01:27:02.817
THE OTHER ISSUE IS WHAT

01:27:02.884 --> 01:27:04.185
SOMETHING UNIQUE TO

01:27:04.252 --> 01:27:05.987
TRANSPORTATION NETWORK PROVIDERS

01:27:06.054 --> 01:27:07.755
THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN AN

01:27:07.822 --> 01:27:09.757
INDIVIDUAL POLICY IS. MORE OFTEN

01:27:09.824 --> 01:27:12.060
THAN NOT, WE HAVE A LOT OF

01:27:12.126 --> 01:27:12.594
PILING PEOPLE INTO THOSE

01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:14.062
VEHICLES. IT'S NOT JUST ONE

01:27:14.128 --> 01:27:15.730
PERSON TAKING A RIDE. IT'S MUCH

01:27:15.797 --> 01:27:17.498
MORE FREQUENTLY THAN A NORMAL

01:27:17.565 --> 01:27:18.566
PRIVATE VEHICLE. YOU'VE GOT MORE

01:27:18.633 --> 01:27:21.836
PEOPLE IN IT THROUGH THE CHAIR.

01:27:21.903 --> 01:27:24.872
ASSEMBLY MEMBER I YOUR QUESTION

01:27:24.939 --> 01:27:26.874
WAS WHERE DID THIS COME FROM?

01:27:26.941 --> 01:27:29.110
AND I WAS NOT PART OF THE

01:27:29.177 --> 01:27:31.112
NEGOTIATIONS, BUT I WAS HERE IN

01:27:31.179 --> 01:27:32.880
2013 WHEN THIS DEAL WAS

01:27:32.947 --> 01:27:34.949
UNFOLDING IN THE LEGISLATURE.

01:27:35.016 --> 01:27:36.684
AND WHAT HAPPENED IS IN 2013,

01:27:36.751 --> 01:27:38.519
THERE WAS A SIX YEAR OLD THAT

01:27:38.586 --> 01:27:40.054
WAS KILLED BY A TNC IN SAN

01:27:40.121 --> 01:27:42.557
FRANCISCO, AND IT REVEALED THAT

01:27:42.624 --> 01:27:44.425
THERE WERE GAPS IN COVERAGE. AND

01:27:44.492 --> 01:27:46.127
PART OF THAT WAS BECAUSE THIS

01:27:46.194 --> 01:27:47.328
WAS A NEW MODEL WHERE PEOPLE

01:27:47.395 --> 01:27:48.730
WERE USING THEIR PERSONAL

01:27:48.796 --> 01:27:50.198
VEHICLES AND WERE NOT EMPLOYEES.

01:27:50.264 --> 01:27:53.601
AND SO THERE WAS JUST THERE HAD

01:27:53.668 --> 01:27:55.203
TO BE A NEW INSURANCE SCHEME

01:27:55.269 --> 01:27:57.071
THAT WAS DEVELOPED AND

01:27:57.138 --> 01:27:58.106
NEGOTIATED. SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:27:58.172 --> 01:28:00.375
BONILLA CAME FORWARD, AND A LOT

01:28:00.441 --> 01:28:02.543
OF THIS WAS AROUND THE DIFFERENT

01:28:02.610 --> 01:28:04.712
PERIODS OF ONE, TWO AND THREE.

01:28:04.779 --> 01:28:06.881
LIKE WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO GET A

01:28:06.948 --> 01:28:09.517
RIDE, WHEN YOU ARE ENGAGED IN A

01:28:09.584 --> 01:28:10.151
RIDE, WHEN YOU HAVE A PASSENGER

01:28:10.218 --> 01:28:11.285
IN YOUR CAR. SO THERE WAS ALL

01:28:11.352 --> 01:28:13.254
THESE DIFFERENT KIND OF

01:28:13.321 --> 01:28:13.888
COMPLEXITIES OF THE LEVELS OF,

01:28:13.955 --> 01:28:15.723
OF INSURANCE. AND AT WHAT PART

01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:19.460
OF THE RIDE. AND SO THERE WERE

01:28:19.527 --> 01:28:20.862
CERTAIN LEVELS THAT WERE

01:28:20.928 --> 01:28:22.263
PROPOSED. THERE WAS A, A VARIETY

01:28:22.330 --> 01:28:24.532
OF THINGS THAT WERE PROPOSED.

01:28:24.599 --> 01:28:28.002
AND ORIGINALLY THE TNCS OPPOSED

01:28:28.069 --> 01:28:32.040
VERY FEROCIOUSLY AS THEY CAN.

01:28:32.106 --> 01:28:34.942
AND THERE WERE NEGOTIATIONS. I

01:28:35.009 --> 01:28:36.644
WAS NOT PART OF THOSE. I CANNOT

01:28:36.711 --> 01:28:38.046
SAY WHAT HAPPENED IN THOSE, BUT

01:28:38.112 --> 01:28:39.380
WHAT CAME OUT OF THEM WAS THAT

01:28:39.447 --> 01:28:42.016
THE TNC SUPPORTED THE BILL THAT

01:28:42.083 --> 01:28:44.152
MOVED FORWARD, AND THE UIM WAS

01:28:44.218 --> 01:28:46.487
PART OF THAT, AND IT WAS A

01:28:46.554 --> 01:28:48.156
NEGOTIATED DEAL. AND AT THE

01:28:48.222 --> 01:28:50.191
TIME, I THINK IT WAS EVALUATING

01:28:50.258 --> 01:28:53.227
THE RISK OF THIS MODEL WHERE IT

01:28:53.294 --> 01:28:56.097
WAS A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN

01:28:56.164 --> 01:28:58.266
PERSONAL VEHICLES WITHOUT A LOT

01:28:58.332 --> 01:29:00.635
OF THE SAME REGULATION THAT

01:29:00.702 --> 01:29:02.270
HAPPENED FOR TAXICABS ON THE

01:29:02.336 --> 01:29:04.172
LOCAL LEVEL, WHERE THINGS ARE

01:29:04.238 --> 01:29:05.773
SET AND THERE'S WEIGHTS AND

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:06.941
MEASURES AND THERE'S LOCAL

01:29:07.008 --> 01:29:08.710
CONTROL. AND SO THAT WAS ALL

01:29:08.776 --> 01:29:10.611
BAKED INTO, I THINK, PART OF IT,

01:29:10.678 --> 01:29:12.346
BECAUSE THE OTHER PIECE WAS THAT

01:29:12.413 --> 01:29:13.247
THAT'S WHERE TRANSPORTATION

01:29:13.314 --> 01:29:15.616
NETWORK COMPANY, AS DIFFERENT

01:29:15.683 --> 01:29:17.452
FROM ALL THESE OTHER THINGS, WAS

01:29:17.518 --> 01:29:19.987
CODIFIED IN THE LAW. SO I'M JUST

01:29:20.054 --> 01:29:22.690
GIVING YOU HISTORY. AND SO

01:29:22.757 --> 01:29:23.524
THAT'S WHERE THIS CAME FROM. IT

01:29:23.591 --> 01:29:28.096
WAS A NEGOTIATED DEAL. SO I

01:29:28.162 --> 01:29:31.332
THINK ONE OF THE HOLD UPS OR

01:29:31.399 --> 01:29:33.434
RESERVATIONS I HAVE IS ALSO

01:29:33.501 --> 01:29:35.203
AROUND THE DRIVER THEMSELVES.

01:29:35.269 --> 01:29:36.904
CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

01:29:36.971 --> 01:29:38.906
WHAT THE IMPACT WOULD BE FOR A

01:29:38.973 --> 01:29:41.442
DRIVER WHO IS SERIOUSLY INJURED,

01:29:41.509 --> 01:29:43.344
WHO IS AN INDEPENDENT

01:29:43.411 --> 01:29:45.446
CONTRACTOR, DOESN'T GET WORKER'S

01:29:45.513 --> 01:29:47.081
COMPENSATION, IS OUT OF WORK FOR

01:29:47.148 --> 01:29:48.649
A WHILE. HOW WILL THIS IMPACT

01:29:48.716 --> 01:29:50.518
THAT WORKER IF THIS BILL WERE TO

01:29:50.585 --> 01:29:52.920
PASS, IF THIS BILL WERE TO PASS,

01:29:52.987 --> 01:29:55.590
IT WOULD NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON

01:29:55.656 --> 01:29:57.825
THE DRIVER AND THAT WE HAVE $1

01:29:57.892 --> 01:29:58.993
MILLION IN DRIVER AND, SORRY,

01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:00.495
OCCUPATIONAL ACCIDENT INSURANCE.

01:30:00.561 --> 01:30:03.698
THAT WAS THE BENEFIT OF PROP 22.

01:30:03.765 --> 01:30:04.565
CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE

01:30:04.632 --> 01:30:06.734
THAT HAS THIS. SO NO OTHER STATE

01:30:06.801 --> 01:30:08.836
HAS THIS TYPE OF INSURANCE FOR

01:30:08.903 --> 01:30:11.005
ANY OF OUR DRIVERS, WITH THE

01:30:11.072 --> 01:30:12.106
EXCEPTION OF WASHINGTON THAT HAS

01:30:12.173 --> 01:30:14.642
A WORKERS COMPENSATION, WHICH WE

01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:17.245
THAT'S A STATE RUN WORKER'S

01:30:17.311 --> 01:30:19.313
COMPENSATION PROGRAM. AND SO THE

01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:21.282
DRIVER WOULD BE PROTECTED FOR

01:30:21.349 --> 01:30:22.583
MEDICAL COSTS AND LOST WAGES

01:30:22.650 --> 01:30:25.052
THROUGH OCCUPATIONAL ACCIDENT

01:30:25.119 --> 01:30:27.321
INSURANCE. AND UIM AFTER THAT

01:30:27.388 --> 01:30:29.524
WOULD STILL BE AVAILABLE IF, YOU

01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:32.560
KNOW, FOR PAIN AND SUFFERING AND

01:30:32.627 --> 01:30:35.530
ADDITIONAL ADDITIONAL COSTS AS

01:30:35.596 --> 01:30:37.265
WELL. I JUST WANT TO MAKE A

01:30:37.331 --> 01:30:38.766
COUPLE OF POINTS TO IN RESPOND

01:30:38.833 --> 01:30:40.668
TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE

01:30:40.735 --> 01:30:43.838
SAID REGARDING HOW THIS CAME TO

01:30:43.905 --> 01:30:45.973
BE IN THAT SITUATION. TRAGIC AS

01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:48.810
IT WAS, OF COURSE, THAT'S AUTO

01:30:48.876 --> 01:30:50.111
LIABILITY. THAT DRIVER WAS AT

01:30:50.178 --> 01:30:52.213
FAULT. AND WE'RE NOT TRYING TO

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:52.814
TOUCH THAT INSURANCE AT ALL.

01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:54.048
THAT'S NOT THE INSURANCE THAT

01:30:54.115 --> 01:30:55.483
WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE AT

01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:57.451
THIS MOMENT. AND WE CARRY $1

01:30:57.518 --> 01:30:58.920
MILLION IN AUTO LIABILITY

01:30:58.986 --> 01:31:00.321
NATIONWIDE DOESN'T MATTER THE

01:31:00.388 --> 01:31:02.924
STATE. AND SO WE'RE NOT TRYING

01:31:02.990 --> 01:31:03.558
TO DIMINISH THAT INSURANCE, AND

01:31:03.624 --> 01:31:05.293
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO ELIMINATE

01:31:05.359 --> 01:31:06.761
ANY TYPE OF INSURANCE EITHER. WE

01:31:06.828 --> 01:31:10.765
ARE STILL KEEPING UIM AND WE

01:31:10.832 --> 01:31:13.334
STILL WANT TO KEEP UIM, EVEN

01:31:13.401 --> 01:31:15.203
THOUGH IN OTHER STATES THAT WE

01:31:15.269 --> 01:31:16.637
DON'T WE STILL THAT WE FEEL THAT

01:31:16.704 --> 01:31:18.706
IT'S STILL APPROPRIATE TO HAVE

01:31:18.773 --> 01:31:21.008
IN CALIFORNIA. WE JUST WANT TO

01:31:21.075 --> 01:31:24.345
HAVE IT AT A AT A REASONABLE

01:31:24.412 --> 01:31:28.716
LEVEL. OKAY. ARE YOU COMPLETE?

01:31:28.783 --> 01:31:31.018
ASSEMBLY MEMBER? I'LL JUST SAY,

01:31:31.085 --> 01:31:33.654
WITH THE SENATOR'S COMMITMENT TO

01:31:33.721 --> 01:31:35.590
FIGURING OUT IN THE STATUTE

01:31:35.656 --> 01:31:37.859
LANGUAGE THAT SHOWS THAT THE

01:31:37.925 --> 01:31:39.527
MONEY WILL GO BACK TOWARDS THE

01:31:39.594 --> 01:31:40.595
WORKERS OR, OF COURSE, THE

01:31:40.661 --> 01:31:42.196
CONSUMERS I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT

01:31:42.263 --> 01:31:44.432
TODAY. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE

01:31:44.498 --> 01:31:46.200
WOULD BE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION

01:31:46.267 --> 01:31:47.535
IF WE HADN'T STARTED AT THAT

01:31:47.602 --> 01:31:50.404
POINT BACK IN 2006 OR WHENEVER

01:31:50.471 --> 01:31:52.573
2013, WHENEVER IT WAS, WHICH

01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:55.309
MAKES IT A LITTLE BIT HARDER TO

01:31:55.376 --> 01:31:57.111
COME DOWN FROM IT. BUT I THINK

01:31:57.178 --> 01:31:58.446
THE SENATOR HAS WORKED REALLY

01:31:58.512 --> 01:32:00.715
HARD ON THE BILL TO TRY TO

01:32:00.781 --> 01:32:01.849
ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS. AND WITH

01:32:01.916 --> 01:32:02.950
THAT LAST CONCERN, IF YOU CAN

01:32:03.017 --> 01:32:04.518
FIND A WAY TO BUILD THAT INTO

01:32:04.585 --> 01:32:06.587
THE STATUTE AND NOT INTO THE

01:32:06.654 --> 01:32:09.090
INTENT LANGUAGE, I THINK YOU'LL

01:32:09.156 --> 01:32:10.024
GET A LOT MORE SUPPORT. THANK

01:32:10.091 --> 01:32:11.959
YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA.

01:32:12.026 --> 01:32:15.930
THANK YOU. I HAVE THREE

01:32:15.997 --> 01:32:19.567
QUESTIONS. THANK TO THE AUTHOR

01:32:19.634 --> 01:32:21.602
FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND

01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:23.037
FOR WORKING ON THIS,

01:32:23.104 --> 01:32:24.105
PARTICULARLY IN THE LAST 48

01:32:24.171 --> 01:32:27.408
HOURS. FOR YOU. MY FIRST

01:32:27.475 --> 01:32:29.110
QUESTION IS AROUND THIS IDEA OF

01:32:29.176 --> 01:32:30.811
AND IT'S BEEN RAISED, BUT I JUST

01:32:30.878 --> 01:32:34.148
WANT TO HIT ON IT AGAIN. SO WE

01:32:34.215 --> 01:32:36.083
HAD AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING

01:32:36.150 --> 01:32:39.754
HERE THAT ESSENTIALLY TEED UP

01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:42.223
THE OUR ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND

01:32:42.290 --> 01:32:44.358
WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH THIS

01:32:44.425 --> 01:32:45.826
PARTICULAR BILL. ONE OF THE

01:32:45.893 --> 01:32:47.261
THINGS THAT WAS SAID REPEATEDLY

01:32:47.328 --> 01:32:48.663
AT THAT INFORMATIONAL HEARING

01:32:48.729 --> 01:32:51.132
WAS THAT THERE WAS A COMMITMENT

01:32:51.198 --> 01:32:55.870
TO ENSURING THAT THE SAVINGS

01:32:55.937 --> 01:32:59.473
FROM THIS KIND OF ENDEAVOR TO

01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:01.943
REDUCE THE, THE, THE, THE

01:33:02.009 --> 01:33:04.245
COVERAGE LEVELS WOULD RESULT IN

01:33:04.312 --> 01:33:08.482
BETTER CARE AND PROVISION OF

01:33:08.549 --> 01:33:11.786
STABILITY FOR WORKERS AND

01:33:11.852 --> 01:33:18.125
AFFORDABILITY FOR THE USERS.

01:33:18.192 --> 01:33:21.128
THERE WAS INTENT LANGUAGE IN THE

01:33:21.195 --> 01:33:22.196
LEGISLATION. IT WAS JUST

01:33:22.263 --> 01:33:25.366
RECENTLY REMOVED, HOWEVER, AND

01:33:25.433 --> 01:33:27.001
MOVED, I BELIEVE, TO A SECTION

01:33:27.068 --> 01:33:30.338
IN THE FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS

01:33:30.404 --> 01:33:33.274
TO ENSURE THAT ANY SAVINGS AND

01:33:33.341 --> 01:33:34.508
REDUCTION IN COSTS WOULD

01:33:34.575 --> 01:33:36.310
ACTUALLY GO TOWARDS OUR

01:33:36.377 --> 01:33:37.311
REINVESTMENT TO ENHANCE THE

01:33:37.378 --> 01:33:38.913
ECONOMIC STABILITY AND WELFARE

01:33:38.980 --> 01:33:42.016
OF DRIVERS AND RIDERS. SO TO THE

01:33:42.083 --> 01:33:45.286
POINT RAISED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:33:45.353 --> 01:33:46.554
ROGERS, IT SEEMS LIKE THAT'S

01:33:46.620 --> 01:33:47.888
ACTUALLY GOING IN THE OPPOSITE

01:33:47.955 --> 01:33:49.156
DIRECTION OF MAKING SURE THAT

01:33:49.223 --> 01:33:50.624
THERE IS LANGUAGE THAT IS GOING

01:33:50.691 --> 01:33:53.461
TO BE IN STATUTE. AND WHILE I

01:33:53.527 --> 01:33:54.128
APPRECIATE THAT THERE IS ANOTHER

01:33:54.195 --> 01:33:56.397
BILL THAT IS IN THE WORKS, I'VE

01:33:56.464 --> 01:33:57.398
BEEN AROUND HERE LONG ENOUGH TO

01:33:57.465 --> 01:33:59.266
KNOW THAT ONE BILL SUCCEEDS AND

01:33:59.333 --> 01:34:01.135
ONE BILL DOESN'T. AND I DON'T

01:34:01.202 --> 01:34:04.605
KNOW THAT I'M OPEN TO ENSURING

01:34:04.672 --> 01:34:10.678
THAT THAT OTHER BILL. GETS

01:34:10.745 --> 01:34:13.280
PASSED IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO

01:34:13.347 --> 01:34:15.449
HAVE SOME A STRONGER GUARANTEE

01:34:15.516 --> 01:34:19.787
IN THIS LEGISLATION, THAT THERE

01:34:19.854 --> 01:34:23.290
WILL BE A CONSIDERABLE PASS

01:34:23.357 --> 01:34:26.794
THROUGH TO THE DRIVERS AND THE

01:34:26.861 --> 01:34:29.964
END USERS WITH SAVINGS. SO ARE,

01:34:30.031 --> 01:34:32.333
ARE ARE THERE TO THE AUTHOR OR

01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:35.136
THE PROPONENTS OF THE BILL? HOW

01:34:35.202 --> 01:34:38.873
WHAT IS THE LEGISLATIVE PATHWAY

01:34:38.939 --> 01:34:41.842
AROUND THAT PARTICULAR GUARANTEE

01:34:41.909 --> 01:34:44.445
IN THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION?

01:34:44.512 --> 01:34:46.781
THANK YOU. AND FIRST LET ME BE

01:34:46.847 --> 01:34:48.349
CLEAR. SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO GO

01:34:48.416 --> 01:34:50.451
THE LONG WAY AROUND. AND SO WE

01:34:50.518 --> 01:34:51.819
DID HAVE THAT INTENT LANGUAGE IN

01:34:51.886 --> 01:34:53.888
THE BILL FROM FROM THE SENATE.

01:34:53.954 --> 01:34:56.924
AND THE CHAIR HERE OBSERVED THAT

01:34:56.991 --> 01:34:58.259
THAT'S NOT ENFORCEABLE AND IT

01:34:58.325 --> 01:35:01.028
DOESN'T DO ANYTHING. SO IT'S

01:35:01.095 --> 01:35:01.996
DEFINITELY NOT ENFORCEABLE.

01:35:02.063 --> 01:35:03.097
PLEASE DON'T MOVE TO FINDINGS

01:35:03.164 --> 01:35:04.799
AND DECKS. YES. SO SHE'S DON'T

01:35:04.865 --> 01:35:07.034
LIKE SO THE CHAIR'S LIKE CLEAR

01:35:07.101 --> 01:35:09.203
LIKE I DON'T WANT I DON'T WANT

01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:09.770
TO PRETEND THERE'S SOMETHING

01:35:09.837 --> 01:35:10.771
THAT THERE'S A GUARANTEE THAT'S

01:35:10.838 --> 01:35:13.407
NOT THERE. SO IT'S IT WASN'T

01:35:13.474 --> 01:35:14.208
INTENDED TO BE A SIGNAL THAT

01:35:14.275 --> 01:35:15.309
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO HOLD

01:35:15.376 --> 01:35:16.243
ACCOUNTABLE, BUT SIMPLY AN

01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:16.777
ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT THAT

01:35:16.844 --> 01:35:18.546
LANGUAGE BY ITSELF DIDN'T

01:35:18.612 --> 01:35:20.247
ACCOMPLISH THE PURPOSE THAT YOU

01:35:20.314 --> 01:35:21.282
AND YOUR COLLEAGUES ON THE

01:35:21.348 --> 01:35:22.316
INSURANCE COMMITTEE HAVE

01:35:22.383 --> 01:35:24.151
OUTLINED. SO THAT'S WHY THE

01:35:24.218 --> 01:35:26.287
AMENDMENT IS BEING TAKEN TODAY

01:35:26.353 --> 01:35:28.155
TO MOVE THAT TO THE FINDINGS AND

01:35:28.222 --> 01:35:30.624
DECLARATIONS. BUT YES, THAT'S

01:35:30.691 --> 01:35:32.860
WHY THIS BILL IS BY ITSELF. I

01:35:32.927 --> 01:35:35.830
INTRODUCED IT SIMPLY TO, TO TAKE

01:35:35.896 --> 01:35:37.898
TO TAKE CARE OF RIDERS AND

01:35:37.965 --> 01:35:39.567
DRIVERS. AND WE ARE STILL TRYING

01:35:39.633 --> 01:35:41.735
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE, WHAT AN

01:35:41.802 --> 01:35:43.204
APPROPRIATE INSTRUMENT IS IN

01:35:43.270 --> 01:35:45.072
ORDER TO, TO ASSURE THAT THOSE

01:35:45.139 --> 01:35:46.607
BENEFITS FLOW TO WHERE TO THE

01:35:46.674 --> 01:35:48.375
FOLKS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING

01:35:48.442 --> 01:35:50.010
ABOUT IN THIS HEARING. SO WE'RE

01:35:50.077 --> 01:35:50.611
COMMITTED TO DOING IT. WE'RE

01:35:50.678 --> 01:35:52.713
JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:54.014
THE RIGHT INSTRUMENT IS IN ORDER

01:35:54.081 --> 01:35:55.316
TO ACCOMPLISH THAT. AND THAT'S

01:35:55.382 --> 01:35:56.584
NOT JUST AN INTENT STATEMENT.

01:35:56.650 --> 01:35:58.719
AND I WOULD SAY I IT'S PURELY

01:35:58.786 --> 01:36:00.788
INTENT LANGUAGE THAT WE MOVE TO

01:36:00.855 --> 01:36:02.456
FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS, WHICH

01:36:02.523 --> 01:36:04.225
IS IN THE FINDINGS AND

01:36:04.291 --> 01:36:05.326
DECLARATIONS, YOU PUT YOUR

01:36:05.392 --> 01:36:07.528
INTENT. AND I DID TELL THE

01:36:07.595 --> 01:36:10.831
AUTHOR THAT 1ST MAY NOT WANT TO

01:36:10.898 --> 01:36:12.633
MAKE THE CLAIMS THAT THERE'S A

01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:13.901
BENEFIT TO RIDERS AND DRIVERS IN

01:36:13.968 --> 01:36:16.504
THIS BILL WHEN THERE IS NO

01:36:16.570 --> 01:36:17.037
LANGUAGE THAT GUARANTEES

01:36:17.104 --> 01:36:18.339
BENEFITS TO RIDERS AND DRIVERS

01:36:18.405 --> 01:36:20.541
IN THIS BILL. SO I HAD GIVEN

01:36:20.608 --> 01:36:22.243
THAT ADVICE BECAUSE WE MOVED IT

01:36:22.309 --> 01:36:23.310
TO FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS,

01:36:23.377 --> 01:36:24.545
BECAUSE IT'S JUST INTENT

01:36:24.612 --> 01:36:25.546
LANGUAGE. IT HAS NO

01:36:25.613 --> 01:36:26.046
ENFORCEABILITY WITH NO

01:36:26.113 --> 01:36:28.716
SPECIFICS. SO THAT IS THE BILL

01:36:28.782 --> 01:36:32.553
IN FRONT OF US TODAY. AND THAT

01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:33.687
BEGAN A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT

01:36:33.754 --> 01:36:35.322
COULD WE DO. SO WE'RE NOT WE'RE

01:36:35.389 --> 01:36:38.159
NOT WE'RE NOT THERE YET. I DON'T

01:36:38.225 --> 01:36:38.993
WANT TO OVERSTATE HOW CLOSE WE

01:36:39.059 --> 01:36:41.629
ARE, BUT BUT WE ARE WE ARE

01:36:41.695 --> 01:36:44.899
ABSOLUTE INTENT IS FOR IS TO

01:36:44.965 --> 01:36:46.000
INCLUDE SOMETHING SUBSTANTIVE

01:36:46.066 --> 01:36:48.035
THAT IS NOT JUST FINDINGS,

01:36:48.102 --> 01:36:49.103
DECLARATIONS AND INTENT ON THAT,

01:36:49.170 --> 01:36:51.172
PRECISELY THAT ISSUE. AND I

01:36:51.238 --> 01:36:52.907
WOULD SAY FROM A COMPANY

01:36:52.973 --> 01:36:53.440
PERSPECTIVE, HEARING THAT

01:36:53.507 --> 01:36:55.442
FEEDBACK TODAY, I WANT US TO

01:36:55.509 --> 01:36:56.944
ALSO TAKE OWNERSHIP IN THAT

01:36:57.011 --> 01:36:58.445
COMMITMENT. I THINK THERE ARE

01:36:58.512 --> 01:37:00.714
SOME LEGAL AMBIGUITIES BECAUSE

01:37:00.781 --> 01:37:02.917
OF PROP 22 AND FIGURING OUT HOW

01:37:02.983 --> 01:37:04.285
WE HAVE THE WORKER BENEFIT THAT

01:37:04.351 --> 01:37:06.086
ISN'T IN CONFLICT WITH CURRENT

01:37:06.153 --> 01:37:08.255
LAW. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE

01:37:08.322 --> 01:37:08.856
HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY TRYING TO

01:37:08.923 --> 01:37:10.724
RESOLVE. AND WORKING WITH MANY

01:37:10.791 --> 01:37:11.492
OF YOUR COLLEAGUES AND OTHER

01:37:11.559 --> 01:37:12.560
STAKEHOLDERS AROUND WHAT A

01:37:12.626 --> 01:37:14.061
WORKER BENEFIT COULD LOOK LIKE.

01:37:14.128 --> 01:37:15.396
SEPARATE FROM THAT, AS MENTIONED

01:37:15.462 --> 01:37:19.400
EARLIER, THE BOOKING FEE IS A

01:37:19.466 --> 01:37:20.467
TRANSPARENT WAY FOR WHERE

01:37:20.534 --> 01:37:22.269
INSURANCE COSTS SIT TODAY AND

01:37:22.336 --> 01:37:24.004
FIGURING OUT HOW WE CAN LEVERAGE

01:37:24.071 --> 01:37:25.539
A LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY TO SO

01:37:25.606 --> 01:37:28.442
RIDERS KNOW THE BENEFIT THAT

01:37:28.509 --> 01:37:29.810
THEY WILL BE RECEIVING AS A

01:37:29.877 --> 01:37:31.245
BYPRODUCT OF THIS POLICY. BUT

01:37:31.312 --> 01:37:33.347
HERE YOU COMPLETELY ON IT,

01:37:33.414 --> 01:37:34.748
NEEDING TO BE QUANTIFIABLE AND

01:37:34.815 --> 01:37:37.051
MORE DEFINED. AND THERE'S A LOT

01:37:37.117 --> 01:37:38.886
OF CONVERSATION UNDERWAY ON HOW

01:37:38.953 --> 01:37:40.754
ON HOW WE DO THAT, HOW WE CAN

01:37:40.821 --> 01:37:42.289
ACCOMPLISH THAT. SO I JUST

01:37:42.356 --> 01:37:43.457
WANTED TO NAME OUR COMMITMENT TO

01:37:43.524 --> 01:37:45.759
THAT AS WELL. YEAH, IT'S NOT

01:37:45.826 --> 01:37:46.827
COMPLICATED. THIS IS NOT

01:37:46.894 --> 01:37:48.362
COMPLICATED TECHNICALLY, BECAUSE

01:37:48.429 --> 01:37:49.964
I THINK BOTH COMPANIES. BUT THIS

01:37:50.030 --> 01:37:53.300
POLICY IS MORE IS CLEAR ON THIS,

01:37:53.367 --> 01:37:55.903
WHICH IS THAT, YOU KNOW, LYFT IS

01:37:55.970 --> 01:37:58.372
COMMITTED THAT 70% OF THE FARE

01:37:58.439 --> 01:38:00.774
AFTER THESE KINDS OF FEES GOES

01:38:00.841 --> 01:38:03.177
DIRECTLY TO THE DRIVER PERIOD.

01:38:03.244 --> 01:38:05.145
AND SO ANY ANY SAVINGS THAT

01:38:05.212 --> 01:38:09.183
OCCURS ON THE UIM INSURANCE, 70%

01:38:09.250 --> 01:38:10.985
OF THAT AUTOMATICALLY GOES TO

01:38:11.051 --> 01:38:12.653
THE DRIVER. SO THE MECHANICALLY

01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:13.520
IT'S ALREADY THERE. IT'S

01:38:13.587 --> 01:38:15.422
FIGURING OUT HOW HOW TO DEAL

01:38:15.489 --> 01:38:16.624
WITH IT STATUTORILY, SINCE WE

01:38:16.690 --> 01:38:18.192
DON'T REGULATE PRICES AT THE, AT

01:38:18.259 --> 01:38:19.994
THE, AT THE, AT THE TNCS

01:38:20.060 --> 01:38:21.262
DIRECTLY. SO THAT'S WHERE IT'S

01:38:21.328 --> 01:38:22.963
NOT WE'RE TRYING TO THAT WE'RE

01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:24.398
TRYING TO HAMMER THE COMPANIES.

01:38:24.465 --> 01:38:26.166
IT'S JUST HOW TO MAKE THIS WORK

01:38:26.233 --> 01:38:28.235
IN A WAY THAT IS COMPLIANT WITH

01:38:28.302 --> 01:38:29.270
PROP 22, AND THAT CAN ACHIEVE

01:38:29.336 --> 01:38:30.204
WHAT YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE

01:38:30.271 --> 01:38:30.838
DESCRIBING ASSEMBLY. APPRECIATE

01:38:30.904 --> 01:38:33.107
THAT. AND THAT'S VERY HELPFUL

01:38:33.173 --> 01:38:36.076
EXPLANATION. THE SECOND IS

01:38:36.143 --> 01:38:37.811
SEEMINGLY TANGENTIAL, BUT NOT

01:38:37.878 --> 01:38:41.215
FOR ME. AT THE SAME INFORMATION

01:38:41.282 --> 01:38:45.352
HEARING I ASKED A QUESTION OR OR

01:38:45.419 --> 01:38:48.355
SHORTLY THEREAFTER AROUND

01:38:48.422 --> 01:38:51.925
ARBITRATION. SO THERE CURRENTLY

01:38:51.992 --> 01:38:54.895
IS THE REALITY THAT FOR

01:38:54.962 --> 01:38:57.131
PLATFORMS PARTICULARLY LIKE

01:38:57.197 --> 01:38:59.400
UBERS, JUST ABOUT LYFT IS JUST

01:38:59.466 --> 01:39:01.635
RIDE SHARE. AT THIS POINT, YOU

01:39:01.702 --> 01:39:03.270
KNOW, YOU DON'T DO OTHER THINGS

01:39:03.337 --> 01:39:05.572
LIKE UBER DOES A LOT OF OTHER

01:39:05.639 --> 01:39:08.409
STUFF. UBER DOES A LOT OF OTHER

01:39:08.475 --> 01:39:11.478
THERE. THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT

01:39:11.545 --> 01:39:13.480
IS A PART OF THE TERMS OF USE

01:39:13.547 --> 01:39:16.483
FOR A PLATFORM USER. SO I GO ON,

01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:19.687
I AGREE TO BE ON THE PLATFORM TO

01:39:19.753 --> 01:39:21.722
BE ABLE TO DO UBER EATS OR GET

01:39:21.789 --> 01:39:25.426
ON A SCOOTER OR GET MY, YOU

01:39:25.492 --> 01:39:28.195
KNOW, FOOD DELIVERED TO ME OR,

01:39:28.262 --> 01:39:31.632
OR TO BE IN A RIDE SHARE. AND

01:39:31.699 --> 01:39:33.334
THE AND THAT'S A USER AGREEMENT.

01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:36.603
RIGHT. SO I'M ENTERING INTO THE

01:39:36.670 --> 01:39:39.873
PLATFORM. I HAVE ONE PARTICULAR

01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:41.742
NEEDS IN TERMS OF THE LEVEL OF

01:39:41.809 --> 01:39:44.178
ARBITRATION THAT I MIGHT NEED,

01:39:44.244 --> 01:39:46.680
SHOULD I NOT HAVE MY SOUP

01:39:46.747 --> 01:39:48.115
DELIVERED TO ME? I HAVE A

01:39:48.182 --> 01:39:49.216
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SET OF

01:39:49.283 --> 01:39:50.884
NEEDS. SHOULD I BE INVOLVED IN

01:39:50.951 --> 01:39:54.955
AN ACCIDENT IN A RIDESHARE? BUT

01:39:55.022 --> 01:39:56.790
THE SAME ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS

01:39:56.857 --> 01:39:58.525
BECAUSE I'M A PLATFORM USER,

01:39:58.592 --> 01:40:01.462
APPLIES TO ALL INSTANCES OF USE

01:40:01.528 --> 01:40:04.732
WITH THAT, WITH THE PLATFORM. I

01:40:04.798 --> 01:40:06.867
ASKED A QUESTION ABOUT THIS. I

01:40:06.934 --> 01:40:08.635
DON'T BELIEVE I RECEIVED AN

01:40:08.702 --> 01:40:10.337
ADEQUATE RESPONSE TO THIS, AND I

01:40:10.404 --> 01:40:12.673
ONLY RECEIVED THE RESPONSE JUST

01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:17.845
YESTERDAY AFTER RE ASKING. IT IS

01:40:17.911 --> 01:40:20.481
SOMETHING TO THE AUTHOR AND

01:40:20.547 --> 01:40:22.716
PERHAPS THE PROPONENTS, AN UBER

01:40:22.783 --> 01:40:23.717
SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE THIS IS NOT

01:40:23.784 --> 01:40:26.086
A LYFT ISSUE THAT I WOULD LIKE

01:40:26.153 --> 01:40:28.722
TO HAVE MORE CLARITY AROUND THE

01:40:28.789 --> 01:40:31.625
INTERACTION BETWEEN A REDUCTION

01:40:31.692 --> 01:40:33.660
IN THIS INSURANCE, BECAUSE MANY

01:40:33.727 --> 01:40:36.063
CLAIMS WILL ULTIMATELY HAVE TO

01:40:36.130 --> 01:40:37.398
POTENTIALLY GO TO ARBITRATION

01:40:37.464 --> 01:40:39.600
SHOULD THEY NOT BE SETTLED IN

01:40:39.666 --> 01:40:40.667
THE WAY THAT THEY SHOULD, SO

01:40:40.734 --> 01:40:42.870
THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:40:42.936 --> 01:40:46.373
HAVE USERS NOT AGREEING TO

01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:48.208
ARBITRATION TERMS BECAUSE THEY

01:40:48.275 --> 01:40:54.915
THINK THAT THEY. ARE. YOU KNOW,

01:40:54.982 --> 01:40:57.551
GETTING FOOD VERSUS GETTING IN

01:40:57.618 --> 01:40:58.719
RIDESHARE AND GETTING INTO AN

01:40:58.786 --> 01:41:01.422
ACCIDENT. I TAKE YOUR POINT. I

01:41:01.488 --> 01:41:03.457
SAW THE RESPONSE SENT TO YOUR

01:41:03.524 --> 01:41:05.526
OFFICE YESTERDAY. I AM NOT ON

01:41:05.592 --> 01:41:07.261
THE LEGAL TEAM. I READ THEIR

01:41:07.327 --> 01:41:08.896
ANSWERS AND TRIED TO MAKE THEM,

01:41:08.962 --> 01:41:12.032
FRANKLY, MORE CLEAR BECAUSE

01:41:12.099 --> 01:41:14.001
THERE WAS A LOT OF LEGALESE,

01:41:14.067 --> 01:41:15.169
FRANKLY, ON A STARTING POINT ON

01:41:15.235 --> 01:41:15.803
ARBITRATION CLAUSES, I'M GOING

01:41:15.869 --> 01:41:17.538
TO GIVE YOU MY LAYMAN'S TERMS

01:41:17.604 --> 01:41:18.205
UNDERSTANDING, AND WOULD BE

01:41:18.272 --> 01:41:19.673
HAPPY TO BRING IN THE ACTUAL

01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:21.775
LEGAL TEAM AND COME BACK TO YOU

01:41:21.842 --> 01:41:22.843
ON THE INTERSECTION YOU'RE

01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:23.410
TALKING ABOUT, BETWEEN THE

01:41:23.477 --> 01:41:25.245
REDUCTION OF THIS POLICY AND HOW

01:41:25.312 --> 01:41:26.680
THAT INTERPLAYS WITH ARBITRATION

01:41:26.747 --> 01:41:28.415
TERMS, I CURRENT AND CURRENT

01:41:28.482 --> 01:41:29.716
PRACTICE, I DON'T BELIEVE IT

01:41:29.783 --> 01:41:31.819
WOULD. AND THERE ARE FEDERAL

01:41:31.885 --> 01:41:33.487
OVERSIGHTS ON ON HOW THESE

01:41:33.554 --> 01:41:35.122
AGREEMENTS ARE IN PLACE FOR OUR

01:41:35.189 --> 01:41:37.090
PLATFORM. YOU ARE RIGHT. OUR

01:41:37.157 --> 01:41:37.791
PLATFORM DOES BOTH FOOD DELIVERY

01:41:37.858 --> 01:41:40.694
AND RIDESHARE AND OTHER THINGS.

01:41:40.761 --> 01:41:43.363
SO I TAKE THAT POINT. I WOULD BE

01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:44.598
HAPPY TO SET TIME WITH YOU AND

01:41:44.665 --> 01:41:46.600
OUR LEGAL TEAM. I'M JUST I DON'T

01:41:46.667 --> 01:41:47.434
HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT YOU'RE

01:41:47.501 --> 01:41:49.603
LOOKING FOR. THEY ARE IN PART

01:41:49.670 --> 01:41:50.904
DRIVEN BY THE TERMS OF USE THAT

01:41:50.971 --> 01:41:54.374
A USER, YOU KNOW, EVER HOW MANY

01:41:54.441 --> 01:41:56.944
OF OR HOW MANY OF US HAVE EVER

01:41:57.010 --> 01:41:59.780
DOVE IN INTO DIVED INTO THE

01:41:59.847 --> 01:42:01.248
TERMS OF USE FOR ANY PLATFORM

01:42:01.315 --> 01:42:03.750
THAT WE PROVIDE. SO JUST A POINT

01:42:03.817 --> 01:42:05.452
OF I'M HOPING THAT I CAN GET

01:42:05.519 --> 01:42:08.121
SOME ADDITIONAL CLARITY ON THAT

01:42:08.188 --> 01:42:09.890
MOVING FORWARD. AND THEN THE

01:42:09.957 --> 01:42:12.092
LAST ISSUE OR CONCERN THAT I'D

01:42:12.159 --> 01:42:14.495
LIKE TO RAISE IS THERE HAD BEEN

01:42:14.561 --> 01:42:17.431
SOME DISCUSSION PREVIOUSLY ABOUT

01:42:17.498 --> 01:42:19.900
THE LOOKBACK DATA OR THE REPORTS

01:42:19.967 --> 01:42:22.936
THAT WERE USED TO BE ABLE TO

01:42:23.003 --> 01:42:25.439
BASICALLY RECALIBRATE THE

01:42:25.506 --> 01:42:27.908
INSURANCE COVERAGE. WHEN WAS

01:42:27.975 --> 01:42:31.278
THAT? WHEN WERE THOSE REPORTS

01:42:31.345 --> 01:42:32.212
CONDUCTED? ARE YOU REFERRING TO

01:42:32.279 --> 01:42:35.549
THE 2017 CPAC REPORT OR THE BRG

01:42:35.616 --> 01:42:37.885
REPORT, BRG REPORT? SO WE

01:42:37.951 --> 01:42:39.286
COMMISSIONED THAT STUDY JOINTLY

01:42:39.353 --> 01:42:43.056
AHEAD OF AHEAD OF, FRANKLY, THIS

01:42:43.123 --> 01:42:44.424
LEGISLATION TO TRY AND HAVE

01:42:44.491 --> 01:42:45.759
INDUSTRY DATA BECAUSE OF

01:42:45.826 --> 01:42:46.426
ANTITRUST. WE OBVIOUSLY WE CAN'T

01:42:46.493 --> 01:42:49.029
SHARE OUR DATA DIRECTLY. SO THEY

01:42:49.096 --> 01:42:51.632
PICKED A DATA SET IN THE NOT SO

01:42:51.698 --> 01:42:54.434
DISTANT PAST. IT'S, I BELIEVE,

01:42:54.501 --> 01:42:58.171
Q4 OF 2020 TO Q3 OF 2022. ON

01:42:58.238 --> 01:42:59.907
PAGE 28 OF THAT REPORT, THERE IS

01:42:59.973 --> 01:43:02.042
A COMPLETE PAGE SUMMARY ON HOW

01:43:02.109 --> 01:43:03.343
THE DATA WAS AGGREGATED, THE

01:43:03.410 --> 01:43:05.279
DATA THAT WE GAVE, HOW IT WAS

01:43:05.345 --> 01:43:07.481
MADE SAFE, AND HOW IT WAS USED

01:43:07.548 --> 01:43:08.615
IN THE STUDY. BUT THAT DATA SET

01:43:08.682 --> 01:43:10.183
WAS CHOSEN BECAUSE IT'S NOT IN

01:43:10.250 --> 01:43:13.854
THE DISTANT PAST. AND THE NATURE

01:43:13.921 --> 01:43:15.756
OF THESE TYPES OF UIM CLAIMS

01:43:15.822 --> 01:43:17.591
TAKE TIME TO SETTLE. SO WANTING

01:43:17.658 --> 01:43:19.293
TO MAKE SURE THERE WAS A FULL

01:43:19.359 --> 01:43:20.727
WINDOW OF TIME TO HAVE COMPLETE

01:43:20.794 --> 01:43:22.195
DATA. SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE

01:43:22.262 --> 01:43:26.066
INPUTS ON ON HOW THAT DATA WAS

01:43:26.133 --> 01:43:29.069
SELECTED. AND SORRY. AND JUST TO

01:43:29.136 --> 01:43:31.805
ADD SO FROM OUR EXPERIENCE, UIM

01:43:31.872 --> 01:43:34.474
CLAIMS TAKE ABOUT 30 MONTHS TO

01:43:34.541 --> 01:43:37.311
MATURE. SO WE HAD TO PICK A DATA

01:43:37.377 --> 01:43:39.046
SET WHERE WE HAD A GOOD

01:43:39.112 --> 01:43:40.247
REPRESENTATION OF THESE CLAIMS

01:43:40.314 --> 01:43:41.915
REACHING THEIR END, SO WE COULD

01:43:41.982 --> 01:43:43.684
SEE WHAT THE FINAL CLAIM AMOUNTS

01:43:43.750 --> 01:43:46.653
WOULD BE. YEAH. YOU HAPPEN TO

01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:50.257
PICK A TIME PERIOD THAT IS SMACK

01:43:50.324 --> 01:43:53.060
DAB IN THE MIDDLE OF COVID WHERE

01:43:53.126 --> 01:43:55.262
NOBODY WAS GOING ANYWHERE. SO

01:43:55.329 --> 01:43:59.166
THE OR RELATIVE. SO IF YOU WERE

01:43:59.232 --> 01:44:01.702
TO LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF RIDES

01:44:01.768 --> 01:44:05.772
THAT HAPPENED IN 20 TO 20 20 TO

01:44:05.839 --> 01:44:09.676
22 VERSUS, I DON'T KNOW, 2017 TO

01:44:09.743 --> 01:44:11.178
2019, I'M SURE THAT THERE WOULD

01:44:11.244 --> 01:44:15.048
BE A MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT DATA

01:44:15.115 --> 01:44:17.117
SET TO BE ABLE TO EXTRAPOLATE

01:44:17.184 --> 01:44:18.919
WHETHER OR NOT THESE LEVELS WERE

01:44:18.986 --> 01:44:21.955
THE RIGHT LEVELS TO BE ABLE TO

01:44:22.022 --> 01:44:23.957
EXAMINE. SO I JUST THE

01:44:24.024 --> 01:44:27.661
UNDERLYING DATA SET IS, FOR ME,

01:44:27.728 --> 01:44:31.331
SOMEWHAT SPECIOUS. AND JUST AS A

01:44:31.398 --> 01:44:33.433
AS A POINT OF CONSIDERATION FOR

01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:35.669
YOUR FOR THE RATIONALE THAT

01:44:35.736 --> 01:44:37.337
YOU'RE USING TO BASE THESE LOWER

01:44:37.404 --> 01:44:39.539
AMOUNTS ON. I HEAR THAT FEEDBACK

01:44:39.606 --> 01:44:41.642
AND IT'S A POINT WELL TAKEN. I

01:44:41.708 --> 01:44:43.677
WOULD ALSO ADD SPECIFIC TO JUST

01:44:43.744 --> 01:44:45.412
US. WE HAVE ONE UNDERWRITER FOR

01:44:45.479 --> 01:44:47.180
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE

01:44:47.247 --> 01:44:50.150
ASKED THEM TO DO A STUDY ON OUR

01:44:50.217 --> 01:44:51.518
CLAIMS IN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

01:44:51.585 --> 01:44:53.654
ONE. WHERE DO WE SEE ABUSE IN

01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:55.422
TERMS OF TO YOUR POINT, NOT JUST

01:44:55.489 --> 01:44:57.457
WHEN THE WORLD WASN'T MOVING,

01:44:57.524 --> 01:44:58.558
BUT BEFORE THE WORLD MOVING. AND

01:44:58.625 --> 01:45:00.427
AS THE WORLD REOPENED, AND HOW

01:45:00.494 --> 01:45:03.430
CAN WE SET REALISTIC LIMITS FROM

01:45:03.497 --> 01:45:04.765
THE INSIGHTS FROM OUR

01:45:04.831 --> 01:45:05.999
UNDERWRITER, THE ONE UNDERWRITER

01:45:06.066 --> 01:45:08.402
THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA? SO

01:45:08.468 --> 01:45:09.736
THAT'S WHERE THE 50,100 000 PER

01:45:09.803 --> 01:45:12.673
ACCIDENT CAME FROM. ALSO WORTH

01:45:12.739 --> 01:45:16.343
MENTIONING THAT THE FOR OUR MAIN

01:45:16.410 --> 01:45:18.011
OBJECTIVE WAS FIGURING OUT HOW

01:45:18.078 --> 01:45:19.246
DO WE HAVE DATA THAT WE CAN

01:45:19.312 --> 01:45:22.416
SHARE AS AN INDUSTRY AND NOT NOT

01:45:22.482 --> 01:45:23.817
VIOLATE ANTITRUST, BUT SOMETHING

01:45:23.884 --> 01:45:25.318
THAT ISN'T LOOKING DURING A TIME

01:45:25.385 --> 01:45:27.454
WHERE WE DIDN'T SEE THE SAME

01:45:27.521 --> 01:45:29.289
LEVEL OF ABUSE. YOU'VE SEEN A

01:45:29.356 --> 01:45:31.458
600% INCREASE IN LITIGATION

01:45:31.525 --> 01:45:33.694
ABUSE OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS.

01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:34.961
AN EXAMPLE OF SOME DATA SHARED

01:45:35.028 --> 01:45:37.831
WITH CAC AND THE AUTHOR. SO

01:45:37.898 --> 01:45:39.466
TRYING TO ACTUALLY FIND A DATA

01:45:39.533 --> 01:45:41.101
SET THAT WASN'T SO FAR BACK THAT

01:45:41.168 --> 01:45:43.370
IT DIDN'T CAPTURE SOME OF THE

01:45:43.437 --> 01:45:44.438
THINGS THAT WERE BRINGING TO YOU

01:45:44.504 --> 01:45:45.338
TODAY, AND THEN ALSO

01:45:45.405 --> 01:45:46.339
INDIVIDUALLY JUST WANTING TO

01:45:46.406 --> 01:45:48.275
SHARE WHAT WHAT OUR UNDERWRITER

01:45:48.341 --> 01:45:50.343
FOR THE STATE FOUND AS WELL.

01:45:50.410 --> 01:45:53.547
YEAH, I JUST I HEAR THE

01:45:53.613 --> 01:45:58.351
RATIONALE. I ALSO RECOGNIZE THE.

01:45:58.418 --> 01:46:00.320
THE PITFALL WITH THE PARTICULAR

01:46:00.387 --> 01:46:02.389
DATA SET THAT YOU DECIDED TO

01:46:02.456 --> 01:46:05.592
CHOOSE. SO FOR ME, I VERY MUCH

01:46:05.659 --> 01:46:06.727
APPRECIATE THE CHAIR ACTUALLY

01:46:06.793 --> 01:46:08.895
PULLING TOGETHER AN INFORMATION

01:46:08.962 --> 01:46:10.363
HEARING THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO

01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:12.866
BE ABLE TO FURTHER CONSIDER THIS

01:46:12.933 --> 01:46:14.367
PIECE OF LEGISLATION AS AS WELL

01:46:14.434 --> 01:46:16.703
AS OTHERS THAT MAY BE COMING

01:46:16.770 --> 01:46:21.708
FORWARD. THERE ARE THE PRIMARY

01:46:21.775 --> 01:46:23.009
THING THAT I HAVE DEEP CONCERN

01:46:23.076 --> 01:46:24.377
AROUND WAS THE FIRST POINT THAT

01:46:24.444 --> 01:46:26.113
I RAISED, AND THAT HAS BEEN

01:46:26.179 --> 01:46:27.581
ECHOED BY SEVERAL OF MY

01:46:27.647 --> 01:46:29.282
COLLEAGUES HERE ON THE DAIS SO

01:46:29.349 --> 01:46:33.253
FAR. I KNOW THIS AUTHOR TO BE

01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:36.223
ONE THAT IS TRUE TO HIS WORD AND

01:46:36.289 --> 01:46:39.126
WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON ON THIS

01:46:39.192 --> 01:46:40.794
LEGISLATION TO MAKE SURE THAT IT

01:46:40.861 --> 01:46:42.829
INCORPORATES THE A RESPONSE TO

01:46:42.896 --> 01:46:45.532
THE CONCERNS THAT WE'VE

01:46:45.599 --> 01:46:48.468
OUTLINED. AND SO I WILL BE

01:46:48.535 --> 01:46:50.237
SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY

01:46:50.303 --> 01:46:52.405
COMING OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE.

01:46:52.472 --> 01:46:56.409
BUT I ALSO AM VERY COGNIZANT OF

01:46:56.476 --> 01:47:00.013
THIS PARTICULAR CHAIR'S INTEREST

01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:02.949
IN MAKING SURE THAT THIS

01:47:03.016 --> 01:47:04.551
COMMITTEE IS ABLE TO FULLY

01:47:04.618 --> 01:47:07.654
REVIEW LEGISLATION AS IT MOVES

01:47:07.721 --> 01:47:09.623
THROUGH THE PROCESS AND KNOW

01:47:09.689 --> 01:47:12.559
THAT IF SOMETHING STARTS TO NOT

01:47:12.626 --> 01:47:14.528
LOOK QUITE RIGHT, SHE WILL MAKE

01:47:14.594 --> 01:47:16.062
SURE IT HAS ANOTHER LITTLE PIT

01:47:16.129 --> 01:47:18.665
STOP HERE AND ASSEMBLY,

01:47:18.732 --> 01:47:19.733
COMMUNICATIONS AND CONVEYANCE.

01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:21.401
AND I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT

01:47:21.468 --> 01:47:22.602
ABOUT HER LEADERSHIP AS CHAIR OF

01:47:22.669 --> 01:47:26.973
THIS COMMITTEE. AND I CERTAINLY

01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:28.708
RESERVE MY RIGHT TO NOT VOTE ON

01:47:28.775 --> 01:47:30.744
THIS, SHOULD IT BE ABLE TO COME

01:47:30.811 --> 01:47:32.746
TO THE FLOOR IF SOME OF THE

01:47:32.813 --> 01:47:34.014
CHANGES THAT I'M HOPING ARE IN

01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:36.349
HERE END UP NOT BEING IN HERE?

01:47:36.416 --> 01:47:36.917
THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:47:36.983 --> 01:47:38.885
BONTA, I THINK WE HAVE HOOVER.

01:47:38.952 --> 01:47:40.086
AND DOES ANYBODY ELSE WANT TO

01:47:40.153 --> 01:47:42.455
SPEAK CLOSER? THANK YOU, MADAM

01:47:42.522 --> 01:47:45.458
CHAIR. I THINK FIRST I'LL START

01:47:45.525 --> 01:47:48.261
WITH A QUESTION FOR THE SUPPORT

01:47:48.328 --> 01:47:52.399
OF THE BILL. YOU KNOW, IN YOUR

01:47:52.465 --> 01:47:54.034
YOU MENTIONED THE OTHER STATES,

01:47:54.100 --> 01:47:55.402
YOU KNOW, WE'RE ONE OF FOUR

01:47:55.468 --> 01:47:57.871
STATES THAT HAS A POLICY OF THIS

01:47:57.938 --> 01:47:59.005
MAGNITUDE. WHAT HAS BEEN THE

01:47:59.072 --> 01:48:00.140
EXPERIENCE IN OTHER STATES FOR

01:48:00.207 --> 01:48:02.642
YOUR COMPANIES AND HAS IT WORKED

01:48:02.709 --> 01:48:04.711
OUT? WELL, I KNOW ONE STATISTIC

01:48:04.778 --> 01:48:05.712
WAS SAID THAT THIS THE WHAT'S

01:48:05.779 --> 01:48:08.014
BEING PROPOSED IN THE BILL WOULD

01:48:08.081 --> 01:48:09.716
COVER 96% OF CASES. JUST

01:48:09.783 --> 01:48:10.784
CURIOUS, YOUR EXPERIENCE IN

01:48:10.851 --> 01:48:12.652
OTHER STATES, IF YOU CAN SPEAK

01:48:12.719 --> 01:48:14.087
TO THAT AT ALL, OTHER STATES

01:48:14.154 --> 01:48:15.922
THAT HAVE JUST AS HIGH LIMITS OR

01:48:15.989 --> 01:48:17.757
JUST OR JUST LOWER OR LIMITS

01:48:17.824 --> 01:48:19.192
THAT, YOU KNOW, CLOSER TO WHAT

01:48:19.259 --> 01:48:20.794
WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT PROPOSING

01:48:20.861 --> 01:48:21.795
THIS BILL AND WHAT PROBLEMS

01:48:21.862 --> 01:48:23.830
THAT'S CREATED. YEAH. SO WHAT

01:48:23.897 --> 01:48:25.799
WE'VE SEEN IS LESS ABUSE OF THE

01:48:25.866 --> 01:48:28.301
LEGAL SYSTEM, WHERE IN OUR STUDY

01:48:28.368 --> 01:48:29.970
WE HAD A COMPARISON WITH

01:48:30.036 --> 01:48:31.371
ILLINOIS. AND I KNOW THAT

01:48:31.438 --> 01:48:32.806
ILLINOIS IS A SMALLER STATE PER

01:48:32.873 --> 01:48:34.274
CAPITA. YOU KNOW, AS FAR AS I'M

01:48:34.341 --> 01:48:35.642
SORRY, AS FAR AS RAW NUMBERS,

01:48:35.709 --> 01:48:37.510
BUT PER CAPITA, IT'S SIMILAR

01:48:37.577 --> 01:48:39.012
TYPE OF DRIVING BEHAVIOR,

01:48:39.079 --> 01:48:40.380
SIMILAR TYPE OF LITIGIOUSNESS IN

01:48:40.447 --> 01:48:42.649
THAT STATE. AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN

01:48:42.716 --> 01:48:44.050
IS THAT THE AVERAGE ATTORNEY

01:48:44.117 --> 01:48:47.254
REPPED UIM CLAIM IN ILLINOIS IS

01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:49.289
AROUND $18,000, AND IN

01:48:49.356 --> 01:48:52.993
CALIFORNIA IT'S $300,000. AND SO

01:48:53.059 --> 01:48:55.195
WHERE WE HAVE THESE APPROPRIATE

01:48:55.262 --> 01:48:56.897
LIMITS AND AGAIN, WE'RE SAYING

01:48:56.963 --> 01:48:58.098
APPROPRIATE LIMITS, RISK,

01:48:58.164 --> 01:49:00.934
APPROPRIATE LIMITS, WE'VE SEEN

01:49:01.001 --> 01:49:04.204
MORE FASTER RESOLUTION OF CLAIMS,

01:49:04.271 --> 01:49:07.040
BUT ALSO LOWER CLAIM AMOUNTS AND

01:49:07.107 --> 01:49:10.610
LOWER COSTS FOR RIDESHARE

01:49:10.677 --> 01:49:11.778
RIDERS. SO THAT'S WHAT WE'VE

01:49:11.845 --> 01:49:13.546
SEEN IN OTHER STATES. IN THE

01:49:13.613 --> 01:49:15.482
STATES THAT HAVE HIGHER LIMITS.

01:49:15.548 --> 01:49:17.183
NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY, WE'RE

01:49:17.250 --> 01:49:18.318
DEALING WITH THE SAME ISSUES

01:49:18.385 --> 01:49:20.921
THAT WE HAVE HERE WHERE THERE IS

01:49:20.987 --> 01:49:22.622
A LOT OF OPPORTUNISTIC, I SHOULD

01:49:22.689 --> 01:49:25.258
SAY, ATTORNEYS WHO ARE TAKING

01:49:25.325 --> 01:49:27.193
ADVANTAGE OF THESE HIGH LIMITS.

01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:29.729
THANK YOU. C¯. OKAY. I THINK,

01:49:29.796 --> 01:49:32.365
YOU KNOW, I WOULD PERRY, THAT

01:49:32.432 --> 01:49:33.566
TO, YOU KNOW, THE OPPOSITION. I

01:49:33.633 --> 01:49:35.101
MEAN, WOULD YOU I DON'T KNOW,

01:49:35.168 --> 01:49:36.269
THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS WANT TO

01:49:36.336 --> 01:49:37.671
COMMENT ON THIS. WOULD YOU AGREE

01:49:37.737 --> 01:49:39.472
THAT THERE ARE OPPORTUNISTIC

01:49:39.539 --> 01:49:40.874
PEOPLE THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

01:49:40.941 --> 01:49:42.676
THE LAWS IN THE STATE ATTORNEYS

01:49:42.742 --> 01:49:44.744
THAT, YOU KNOW, IN EVERY

01:49:44.811 --> 01:49:46.346
OCCUPATION, IN EVERY STATE OF

01:49:46.413 --> 01:49:49.983
THE COUNTRY, CAN YOU CAN YOU

01:49:50.050 --> 01:49:52.285
MAYBE SPEAK TO, YOU KNOW, YOU

01:49:52.352 --> 01:49:54.287
KNOW, ONE CONCERN I HAVE, RIGHT,

01:49:54.354 --> 01:49:56.222
THAT I THINK IS PRETTY CLEAR

01:49:56.289 --> 01:49:57.490
THAT PEOPLE ARE PROFITING OFF OF

01:49:57.557 --> 01:49:59.025
CURRENT LAW IN CALIFORNIA IS YOU

01:49:59.092 --> 01:50:00.293
HAVE THESE WEBSITES AS, AS

01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:01.561
SENATOR MENTIONED, WHERE PEOPLE

01:50:01.628 --> 01:50:03.363
ARE ADVERTISING THEIR SERVICES.

01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:05.365
YOU HAVE BILLBOARDS IN SOME

01:50:05.432 --> 01:50:07.167
COMMUNITIES THAT SAY, HEY, IF

01:50:07.233 --> 01:50:07.734
YOU GET IN AN UBER ACCIDENT,

01:50:07.801 --> 01:50:09.869
CALL, CALL THIS NUMBER. TO ME,

01:50:09.936 --> 01:50:11.538
THAT SPEAKS TO THE FACT THAT

01:50:11.604 --> 01:50:12.238
THERE ARE DEFINITELY PEOPLE

01:50:12.305 --> 01:50:15.008
PROFITING ON THIS. SO, YOU KNOW,

01:50:15.075 --> 01:50:17.344
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT THE

01:50:17.410 --> 01:50:18.278
OPPOSITION IS COMFORTABLE WITH?

01:50:18.345 --> 01:50:20.113
I MEAN, IS THAT SOMETHING THAT

01:50:20.180 --> 01:50:21.514
THERE MAY BE AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT

01:50:21.581 --> 01:50:24.117
THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME REFORM?

01:50:24.184 --> 01:50:25.986
IT DOES. AND WE'RE CURRENTLY

01:50:26.052 --> 01:50:26.820
SPONSORING TWO DIFFERENT BILLS

01:50:26.886 --> 01:50:28.421
THIS SESSION TO ADDRESS THAT.

01:50:28.488 --> 01:50:30.156
THE ISSUE, BOTH WITH RESPECT TO

01:50:30.223 --> 01:50:33.793
FEE SHARING WITH STATE AND AB

01:50:33.860 --> 01:50:37.597
931, AS WELL AS ATTORNEY

01:50:37.664 --> 01:50:40.600
ADVERTISING IN SB 37. THOSE

01:50:40.667 --> 01:50:42.702
BILLS ARE ARE WE'RE DEALING WITH

01:50:42.769 --> 01:50:44.604
THAT. AND I'M GLAD YOU ASKED THE

01:50:44.671 --> 01:50:46.339
QUESTION BECAUSE THAT'S THE

01:50:46.406 --> 01:50:47.841
ANSWER. IF THE PROBLEM IS

01:50:47.907 --> 01:50:49.943
ATTORNEY ABUSE, LET'S ADDRESS

01:50:50.010 --> 01:50:51.511
THAT. LET'S NOT TAKE AWAY

01:50:51.578 --> 01:50:52.145
PROTECTION FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:50:52.212 --> 01:50:54.381
INJURED IN ACCIDENTS. YEAH.

01:50:54.447 --> 01:50:55.615
WELL, I APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE.

01:50:55.682 --> 01:50:56.850
I APPRECIATE THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT.

01:50:56.916 --> 01:50:58.318
I WOULD I WOULD DISAGREE WITH

01:50:58.385 --> 01:51:00.186
THE FACT THAT TO ME, THIS IS

01:51:00.253 --> 01:51:01.654
PART OF THAT REFORM AS WELL. AND

01:51:01.721 --> 01:51:04.391
I THINK AN IMPORTANT PART OF

01:51:04.457 --> 01:51:04.924
REDUCING THOSE INCENTIVES,

01:51:04.991 --> 01:51:05.925
PERVERSE INCENTIVES TO MAYBE

01:51:05.992 --> 01:51:07.927
PROFIT OFF OF THESE TYPES OF

01:51:07.994 --> 01:51:09.863
CASES. I KNOW I'LL MOVE ON TO

01:51:09.929 --> 01:51:11.664
ANOTHER COMMENT THAT WAS MADE

01:51:11.731 --> 01:51:13.600
FROM THE OPPOSITION ON THIS NEED

01:51:13.666 --> 01:51:14.567
TO GUARANTEE THAT THIS MONEY

01:51:14.634 --> 01:51:16.503
GOES SOMEWHERE. HOW EXACTLY?

01:51:16.569 --> 01:51:18.505
FIRST OF ALL, WHY DO WE NEED A

01:51:18.571 --> 01:51:20.407
GUARANTEE OF THAT OF THAT SORT

01:51:20.473 --> 01:51:22.208
IN THE STATUTE? TO ME, THAT

01:51:22.275 --> 01:51:23.043
SEEMS PRETTY EXTREME. BUT

01:51:23.109 --> 01:51:24.911
SECONDLY, YOU KNOW, HOW WOULD

01:51:24.978 --> 01:51:27.380
YOU RECOMMEND THAT WE DO THAT?

01:51:27.447 --> 01:51:32.452
HOW WOULD WE EVEN FORMAT THAT?

01:51:32.519 --> 01:51:35.321
THAT IS AN EXCELLENT QUESTION.

01:51:35.388 --> 01:51:39.025
AS THE PROPONENT SAID, THEY

01:51:39.092 --> 01:51:40.760
PASSED, THEY SPENT $200 MILLION

01:51:40.827 --> 01:51:43.663
TO PASS PROP 22, AND THAT

01:51:43.730 --> 01:51:44.831
HANDCUFFED THE LEGISLATURE IN

01:51:44.898 --> 01:51:47.534
MANY WAY FROM MAKING CHANGES. WE

01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:51.304
WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOMETHING.

01:51:51.371 --> 01:51:53.306
THERE'S, YOU KNOW, LIKE THERE'S

01:51:53.373 --> 01:51:55.642
BEEN STATEMENTS THAT THIS THERE

01:51:55.708 --> 01:51:57.310
WOULD BE A REDUCTION, YOU COULD

01:51:57.377 --> 01:51:59.012
BE ABLE TO SEE A REDUCTION IN

01:51:59.079 --> 01:52:00.180
THE AMOUNT THAT'S CHARGED AS A

01:52:00.246 --> 01:52:02.982
FEE IN TERMS OF THE INSURANCE

01:52:03.049 --> 01:52:05.552
RATES. THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE

01:52:05.618 --> 01:52:07.754
FAIR NECESSARILY. THERE MIGHT BE

01:52:07.821 --> 01:52:09.689
A REDUCTION IN WHAT PASSENGERS

01:52:09.756 --> 01:52:10.523
ARE PAYING BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:52:10.590 --> 01:52:12.792
PAYING LESS OF THE FEE, BUT

01:52:12.859 --> 01:52:14.327
THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT THAT

01:52:14.394 --> 01:52:16.396
WOULD BE SHIFTED ON TO THE FAIR

01:52:16.463 --> 01:52:18.231
THAT THE DRIVER GETS A PART OF.

01:52:18.298 --> 01:52:19.466
THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT WAYS THAT

01:52:19.532 --> 01:52:21.067
YOU COULD ADDRESS IT. JUST

01:52:21.134 --> 01:52:22.669
OPENING UP A CONVERSATION ON

01:52:22.735 --> 01:52:24.370
WHAT IS THIS DYNAMIC PRICING,

01:52:24.437 --> 01:52:25.738
WHAT IS ALGORITHMIC WAGE

01:52:25.805 --> 01:52:27.540
SETTING, WHAT IS ANY OF THE

01:52:27.607 --> 01:52:29.776
BLACK BOX ALGORITHMS THAT

01:52:29.843 --> 01:52:33.346
THEY'RE DOING TO SET BOTH PRICES

01:52:33.413 --> 01:52:36.182
AND WHAT DRIVERS ARE PAID? SO I

01:52:36.249 --> 01:52:37.951
THINK THERE'S JUST A LOT OF

01:52:38.017 --> 01:52:40.320
QUESTIONS THERE IN TERMS BEFORE

01:52:40.386 --> 01:52:42.822
WE CAN EVEN GET TO THE QUESTION

01:52:42.889 --> 01:52:44.557
OF A GUARANTEE. OKAY. THANK YOU.

01:52:44.624 --> 01:52:46.292
YOU KNOW, I WOULD JUST ADD ON

01:52:46.359 --> 01:52:47.527
AND THIS WILL BE MY FINAL

01:52:47.594 --> 01:52:49.295
COMMENT, I'LL PASS IT TO MY

01:52:49.362 --> 01:52:50.997
OTHER COLLEAGUE. BUT YOU KNOW,

01:52:51.064 --> 01:52:52.532
TO ME THIS WHOLE SITUATION IS

01:52:52.599 --> 01:52:55.034
INTERESTING. I THINK THE

01:52:55.101 --> 01:52:56.035
OBVIOUSLY I THINK THE COMPANIES

01:52:56.102 --> 01:52:57.403
HAVE BEEN VERY TRANSPARENT, YOU

01:52:57.470 --> 01:52:59.205
KNOW, WITH THEIR PRICING WHEN IT

01:52:59.272 --> 01:53:01.808
COMES TO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

01:53:01.875 --> 01:53:02.408
BREAKDOWN, THERE ARE DIFFERENT

01:53:02.475 --> 01:53:03.309
BREAKDOWNS FOR DIFFERENT PRICES

01:53:03.376 --> 01:53:04.277
FOR DIFFERENT THINGS AND WHY

01:53:04.344 --> 01:53:06.079
PRICES ARE SO HIGH. YOU KNOW, I

01:53:06.146 --> 01:53:07.747
DO HAVE A HUGE CONCERN THAT THE

01:53:07.814 --> 01:53:10.016
PRICES IN GENERAL FOR UBERS

01:53:10.083 --> 01:53:11.151
LYFTS, JUST RIDESHARES IN

01:53:11.217 --> 01:53:12.986
GENERAL HAVE GONE UP PRETTY

01:53:13.052 --> 01:53:14.020
SUBSTANTIALLY. THAT IS SOMETHING

01:53:14.087 --> 01:53:15.054
I'VE BROUGHT UP TO THE

01:53:15.121 --> 01:53:16.623
COMPANIES. I'VE BROUGHT UP TO A

01:53:16.689 --> 01:53:19.025
NUMBER OF FOLKS IN MY COMMUNITY,

01:53:19.092 --> 01:53:20.827
AND A LARGE PART OF THOSE COSTS

01:53:20.894 --> 01:53:22.428
ARE BEING DRIVEN RIGHT NOW BY

01:53:22.495 --> 01:53:23.296
THESE INSURANCE COSTS, WHICH I

01:53:23.363 --> 01:53:25.265
WOULD SAY ARE UNREASONABLY HIGH.

01:53:25.331 --> 01:53:27.433
TO ME, THE BEST GUARANTEE THAT

01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:29.903
WE HAVE FOR MAKING SURE THOSE

01:53:29.969 --> 01:53:31.538
THOSE SAVINGS GET PASSED ON TO

01:53:31.604 --> 01:53:33.773
RIDERS AND DRIVERS IS

01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:35.308
COMPETITION. WE HAVE MULTIPLE

01:53:35.375 --> 01:53:36.609
COMPANIES IN THIS SPACE. WE

01:53:36.676 --> 01:53:37.777
HAVE, YOU KNOW, NOT JUST UBER

01:53:37.844 --> 01:53:39.279
AND LYFT THAT ARE HERE TODAY,

01:53:39.345 --> 01:53:40.547
BUT WE ALSO HAVE WAYMO. AND

01:53:40.613 --> 01:53:42.115
THERE'S ALL THESE OTHER

01:53:42.182 --> 01:53:43.383
DIFFERENT OPTIONS OUT THERE FOR

01:53:43.449 --> 01:53:45.285
CONSUMERS. AND THEY'RE GOING TO

01:53:45.351 --> 01:53:46.586
BE INCENTIVIZED TO COMPETE TO

01:53:46.653 --> 01:53:48.254
REDUCE THEIR PRICES. AND I THINK

01:53:48.321 --> 01:53:49.422
IF WE CAN REDUCE SOME OF THEIR

01:53:49.489 --> 01:53:51.624
FIXED COSTS, WHICH I THINK THIS

01:53:51.691 --> 01:53:53.693
BILL IS ATTEMPTING TO DO, THAT'S

01:53:53.760 --> 01:53:55.828
GOING TO GO A LONG WAY IN TERMS

01:53:55.895 --> 01:53:58.031
OF GUARANTEEING THE FACT THAT

01:53:58.097 --> 01:54:00.466
THOSE SAVINGS GET PASSED ALONG

01:54:00.533 --> 01:54:02.969
JUST IN THE FREE MARKET. AND SO

01:54:03.036 --> 01:54:04.704
WHAT WHAT I, WHAT I DO KNOW

01:54:04.771 --> 01:54:06.639
RIGHT NOW, AND THAT I'M ASSURED

01:54:06.706 --> 01:54:08.775
OF, IS THAT A LOT OF THESE

01:54:08.841 --> 01:54:10.076
DOLLARS UNDER THE STATUS QUO,

01:54:10.143 --> 01:54:11.277
DRIVERS AND RIDERS ARE PAYING

01:54:11.344 --> 01:54:13.046
THESE COSTS. AND THOSE COSTS IN

01:54:13.112 --> 01:54:15.315
A LOT OF CASES ARE GOING INTO

01:54:15.381 --> 01:54:16.583
THE HANDS OF ATTORNEYS. I WOULD

01:54:16.649 --> 01:54:18.117
MUCH RATHER SEE THEM GO BACK

01:54:18.184 --> 01:54:19.118
INTO THE HANDS OF CALIFORNIANS

01:54:19.185 --> 01:54:21.054
IN THE FREE MARKET. SO WITH

01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:21.955
THAT, YOU KNOW, SENATOR, I

01:54:22.021 --> 01:54:23.389
APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THE BILL

01:54:23.456 --> 01:54:24.958
FORWARD. DO PLAN ON SUPPORTING

01:54:25.024 --> 01:54:27.827
IT. AND, YOU KNOW, I DO THINK,

01:54:27.894 --> 01:54:29.229
YOU KNOW, I'M SURE MY COLLEAGUES

01:54:29.295 --> 01:54:31.297
HAVE OTHER THOUGHTS, BUT WE'LL

01:54:31.364 --> 01:54:32.765
KEEP THE CONVERSATIONS GOING ON

01:54:32.832 --> 01:54:35.635
IT. BUT BUT WOULD LOVE TO BE

01:54:35.702 --> 01:54:36.803
ADDED AS COAUTHOR AS WELL, IF

01:54:36.869 --> 01:54:39.372
YOU'LL HAVE ME. THANK YOU. OKAY.

01:54:39.439 --> 01:54:43.243
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THANK YOU.

01:54:43.309 --> 01:54:45.745
CHAIR BURNER. THANK YOU TO

01:54:45.812 --> 01:54:47.547
SENATOR CABALDON AND ALL THE

01:54:47.614 --> 01:54:49.015
STAKEHOLDERS WHO ARE HERE. I

01:54:49.082 --> 01:54:50.817
KNOW THIS IS A REALLY TRICKY

01:54:50.883 --> 01:54:52.452
ISSUE AND REALLY WANT TO THANK

01:54:52.518 --> 01:54:54.420
OUR CHAIR FOR HAVING AN

01:54:54.487 --> 01:54:55.788
INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON THIS,

01:54:55.855 --> 01:54:58.391
AND JUST WANTED TO KIND OF ECHO

01:54:58.458 --> 01:55:01.327
SOME OF THE, YOU KNOW, THOUGHTS

01:55:01.394 --> 01:55:03.496
AND CONCERNS AND ISSUES THAT

01:55:03.563 --> 01:55:05.231
WERE RAISED BY MY COLLEAGUES.

01:55:05.298 --> 01:55:07.433
YOU KNOW, I THINK FOR ME, AS IT

01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:09.135
RELATES TO THIS BILL IN

01:55:09.202 --> 01:55:11.571
PARTICULAR, I, YOU KNOW, THINK

01:55:11.638 --> 01:55:13.873
ABOUT THREE THINGS. I THINK

01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:16.442
ABOUT AFFORDABILITY, WHICH WAS

01:55:16.509 --> 01:55:18.945
MENTIONED, I THINK ABOUT

01:55:19.012 --> 01:55:20.747
PROTECTING OUR WORKERS, WHICH IS

01:55:20.813 --> 01:55:23.516
REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME.

01:55:23.583 --> 01:55:25.785
AND I ALSO THINK ABOUT THE

01:55:25.852 --> 01:55:27.987
CONSUMER PROTECTION PIECE AROUND

01:55:28.054 --> 01:55:29.989
THIS. AND SO I'M GOING TO DIVE

01:55:30.056 --> 01:55:32.258
INTO JUST THREE QUESTIONS THAT I

01:55:32.325 --> 01:55:35.128
HAVE. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT

01:55:35.194 --> 01:55:39.032
I HAD WAS AROUND THE LEVEL OF

01:55:39.098 --> 01:55:41.200
INSURANCE. I KNOW THAT WE ARE

01:55:41.267 --> 01:55:44.504
REDUCING THE COVERAGE OF 1

01:55:44.570 --> 01:55:48.608
MILLION, AND IT WENT FROM 50,000

01:55:48.675 --> 01:55:52.045
UP TO 100,000 TO NOW THE CURRENT

01:55:52.111 --> 01:55:54.180
LEVEL OF 100,000 TO 300,000. CAN

01:55:54.247 --> 01:55:56.449
YOU JUST EXPLAIN AND SHARE KIND

01:55:56.516 --> 01:55:58.551
OF HOW WE ARRIVED AT THOSE

01:55:58.618 --> 01:55:59.352
NUMBERS AND WHETHER OR NOT

01:55:59.419 --> 01:56:01.988
THAT'S ENOUGH COVERAGE RELATIVE

01:56:02.055 --> 01:56:04.357
TO OTHER VEHICLES ON THE ROAD? I

01:56:04.424 --> 01:56:06.793
KNOW THAT, YOU KNOW, WE SPOKE IN

01:56:06.859 --> 01:56:07.827
GENERALITIES DURING THE

01:56:07.894 --> 01:56:08.861
INFORMATIONAL HEARING, SO WANTED

01:56:08.928 --> 01:56:11.197
TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THIS MORE

01:56:11.264 --> 01:56:13.800
RELATIVE TO THE ROAD THAT WE ALL

01:56:13.866 --> 01:56:15.835
DRIVE ON. FOR THOSE OF US WHO

01:56:15.902 --> 01:56:18.237
DRIVE, THANK YOU. THANKS,

01:56:18.304 --> 01:56:22.041
ASSEMBLYMEMBER. CLOSER. THE 5100

01:56:22.108 --> 01:56:24.744
IS WAS THE LEVELS THAT WERE

01:56:24.811 --> 01:56:27.714
DERIVED FROM THESE VARIOUS

01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:29.615
STUDIES AS WELL AS DATA. I DON'T

01:56:29.682 --> 01:56:31.451
KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER CARRIED A

01:56:31.517 --> 01:56:34.087
BILL FOR THAT. HAD SPONSORS THAT

01:56:34.153 --> 01:56:34.887
WERE LEGALLY DISALLOWED FROM

01:56:34.954 --> 01:56:35.521
TALKING TO EACH OTHER, BUT ALSO

01:56:35.588 --> 01:56:37.223
DATA THAT WE'VE WE'VE ACHIEVED.

01:56:37.290 --> 01:56:39.225
THAT'S PROBABLY COMMON HERE. NOT

01:56:39.292 --> 01:56:42.161
IN NOT IN MY POLICY AREA. SO IN

01:56:42.228 --> 01:56:44.697
ADDITION TO THE STUDIES, THE

01:56:44.764 --> 01:56:45.264
DIRECT DATA THAT WE'VE ASKED

01:56:45.331 --> 01:56:46.499
FOR, AND THIS IS ALL THE CHARTS

01:56:46.566 --> 01:56:49.969
SHOW, 5100 IS THE IS THAT PLACE

01:56:50.036 --> 01:56:52.505
BASED ON CLAIMS IN CASES AND

01:56:52.572 --> 01:56:55.074
ALSO TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFIT TO

01:56:55.141 --> 01:56:56.609
RIDERS AND TO DRIVERS BECAUSE

01:56:56.676 --> 01:56:58.211
THAT MORE THAN THE THAN THE

01:56:58.277 --> 01:56:59.345
STATUTORY LANGUAGE OR ANYTHING

01:56:59.412 --> 01:57:01.147
IS THE BIGGEST DRIVER, THE

01:57:01.214 --> 01:57:02.548
BIGGEST DETERMINANT OF HOW MUCH

01:57:02.615 --> 01:57:04.717
SAVINGS THERE WILL BE FOR RIDERS

01:57:04.784 --> 01:57:07.053
IS AN AFFORDABILITY WILL BE WHAT

01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:08.287
THE LIMITS ULTIMATELY ARE. SO

01:57:08.354 --> 01:57:11.290
THE CHANGES IN THE LIMITS ARE

01:57:11.357 --> 01:57:12.358
NOT FOR FREE. SO THAT WAS THE

01:57:12.425 --> 01:57:14.093
BASIS OF THE 5100. THE

01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:15.361
DISCUSSIONS HERE IN THE ASSEMBLY

01:57:15.428 --> 01:57:16.963
HAVE BEEN ABOUT TRYING TO STRIKE

01:57:17.029 --> 01:57:18.831
A DIFFERENT BALANCE AND TO TRY

01:57:18.898 --> 01:57:20.566
TO REFINE THOSE. SO WE'VE ENDED

01:57:20.633 --> 01:57:21.768
UP AT 103 HUNDRED, AND AS A

01:57:21.834 --> 01:57:23.536
RESULT, WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE

01:57:23.603 --> 01:57:24.637
SAME DATA SOURCES. WE HAVE THE

01:57:24.704 --> 01:57:26.906
SOURCES, WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE

01:57:26.973 --> 01:57:28.674
SAME CHARTS AT THAT NUMBER. BUT

01:57:28.741 --> 01:57:30.143
TRYING TO FIND, MAKE, MAKE SURE

01:57:30.209 --> 01:57:32.111
THAT WE'RE ABLE TO MEET THE

01:57:32.178 --> 01:57:33.513
POLICY PREFERENCES HERE. HAVING

01:57:33.579 --> 01:57:36.149
SAID THAT, THAT THAT 103 HUNDRED

01:57:36.215 --> 01:57:38.217
FALLS OUTSIDE OF LIKE WHERE THE

01:57:38.284 --> 01:57:39.752
VAST MAJORITY OF THESE THESE

01:57:39.819 --> 01:57:41.487
CASES ARE. SO I FEEL COMFORTABLE

01:57:41.554 --> 01:57:43.523
THAT IN THAT RANGE, WE ARE IN

01:57:43.589 --> 01:57:44.757
THE WE'RE IN AN AREA THAT WE

01:57:44.824 --> 01:57:47.226
WILL COVER. THE VAST MAJORITY OF

01:57:47.293 --> 01:57:49.028
THEM, ESPECIALLY GIVEN GIVEN

01:57:49.095 --> 01:57:51.264
THESE LIKE AT THE END OF THE

01:57:51.330 --> 01:57:52.999
TAIL CASES THAT ARE EXTRA

01:57:53.065 --> 01:57:54.500
EXPENSIVE, THAT WOULDN'T BE THAT

01:57:54.567 --> 01:57:55.535
WOULDN'T FALL INTO EITHER ONE,

01:57:55.601 --> 01:57:57.270
BUT THEY WOULD STILL, THOSE

01:57:57.336 --> 01:57:59.739
CASES ARE JUST TO REMIND US THAT

01:57:59.806 --> 01:58:02.708
IF RIGHT NOW MY CLAIM IS AT

01:58:02.775 --> 01:58:04.210
$950,000 OR MORE LIKELY AT $1

01:58:04.277 --> 01:58:05.344
MILLION, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE

01:58:05.411 --> 01:58:07.380
STATUTORY CAP IS, IT'S VERY

01:58:07.447 --> 01:58:08.681
LIKELY THAT I'M THAT I'M DOING

01:58:08.748 --> 01:58:10.316
THAT BECAUSE I'VE BEEN ADVISED

01:58:10.383 --> 01:58:12.185
TO SEEK A SEPARATE A SEPARATE

01:58:12.251 --> 01:58:13.753
DOCTOR AND A SEPARATE ANALYSIS.

01:58:13.820 --> 01:58:15.521
AND SO IT ISN'T THAT I WOULDN'T

01:58:15.588 --> 01:58:16.589
BE COVERED ANY LONGER, I JUST

01:58:16.656 --> 01:58:18.191
WOULD BE COVERED THROUGH THE

01:58:18.257 --> 01:58:19.892
REGULAR SYSTEM THAT EVERYBODY

01:58:19.959 --> 01:58:21.427
ELSE USES FOR THAT SYSTEM. SO I

01:58:21.494 --> 01:58:23.162
THINK THAT'S, THAT'S, THAT'S THE

01:58:23.229 --> 01:58:25.731
RATIONALE FOR, FOR FIGURING OUT

01:58:25.798 --> 01:58:26.365
HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

01:58:26.432 --> 01:58:27.767
COVERING ALL ALL OF THE CASES

01:58:27.834 --> 01:58:29.368
THAT ARE NORMAL CASES THAT WOULD

01:58:29.435 --> 01:58:31.137
BE IN ANY OTHER SECTOR AND THEN

01:58:31.204 --> 01:58:33.005
SOME, WHILE ALSO TRYING TO

01:58:33.072 --> 01:58:35.174
MAXIMIZE THE SAVINGS THAT THIS

01:58:35.241 --> 01:58:37.009
RELATES TO, SOMETHING THAT MR.

01:58:37.076 --> 01:58:40.046
JOHNSON, MR. JOHNSON PRIME, SAID

01:58:40.112 --> 01:58:43.082
ABOUT. SORRY, NICK, BUT ABOUT

01:58:43.149 --> 01:58:45.017
ABOUT THE MARKETPLACE FOR

01:58:45.084 --> 01:58:46.853
BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS A REALLY

01:58:46.919 --> 01:58:47.653
IMPORTANT POINT BECAUSE HE SAID,

01:58:47.720 --> 01:58:50.923
LOOK, UIM IS AN EXTRAORDINARILY

01:58:50.990 --> 01:58:51.958
AFFORDABLE. IT'S EASY TO GET,

01:58:52.024 --> 01:58:54.560
IT'S CHEAP. SO IT SHOULDN'T BE

01:58:54.627 --> 01:58:55.895
SO MUCH OF AN ISSUE. AND THAT

01:58:55.962 --> 01:58:57.897
THAT THAT WAS THE CASE A DECADE

01:58:57.964 --> 01:58:58.931
AGO WHEN THE ORIGINAL

01:58:58.998 --> 01:59:00.633
LEGISLATION WAS PASSED. AND IT'S

01:59:00.700 --> 01:59:01.667
STILL THE CASE TODAY FOR YOU AND

01:59:01.734 --> 01:59:03.603
FOR ME AS INDIVIDUAL DRIVERS.

01:59:03.669 --> 01:59:04.804
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE, NUMBER ONE,

01:59:04.871 --> 01:59:07.573
WE DON'T HAVE TO BUY IT. AND

01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:08.207
NUMBER TWO, IT'S COMPETITIVE.

01:59:08.274 --> 01:59:10.309
AND SO THE PRICE OF THAT

01:59:10.376 --> 01:59:12.211
COVERAGE AND WE'RE TYPICALLY AND

01:59:12.278 --> 01:59:13.746
NONE OF US ARE BUYING MILLION

01:59:13.813 --> 01:59:15.114
DOLLAR UIM COVERAGE AS REGULAR

01:59:15.181 --> 01:59:17.283
DRIVERS. SO THAT'S SO MR.

01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:19.385
JOHNSON'S EXACTLY CORRECT.

01:59:19.452 --> 01:59:21.254
WITHOUT THESE POLICIES UIM WOULD

01:59:21.320 --> 01:59:23.422
BE EXTRAORDINARILY CHEAP. IT

01:59:23.489 --> 01:59:24.690
ISN'T BECAUSE IT IS MANDATORY.

01:59:24.757 --> 01:59:26.559
AND IT'S AT A LIMIT THAT THAT

01:59:26.626 --> 01:59:28.461
AND THAT BOTH INSURANCE

01:59:28.528 --> 01:59:30.229
COMPANIES AND CLAIMANTS KNOW

01:59:30.296 --> 01:59:32.431
THAT IT'S CAUSED THE RATES TO

01:59:32.498 --> 01:59:34.467
GROW TO BE SO HIGH SO FAST.

01:59:34.534 --> 01:59:36.602
OKAY. SO THANK YOU FOR THAT,

01:59:36.669 --> 01:59:38.738
SENATOR. AND IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT

01:59:38.804 --> 01:59:42.041
YOU'RE SHARING IS THAT THE

01:59:42.108 --> 01:59:45.278
COVERAGE AMOUNT OF 51 K. AND

01:59:45.344 --> 01:59:47.046
WHERE WE LANDED AT NOW WITH THE

01:59:47.113 --> 01:59:50.316
AMENDMENTS OF 100 TO 300 K IS

01:59:50.383 --> 01:59:52.418
DOUBLE WHAT THE AVERAGE CLAIM

01:59:52.485 --> 01:59:54.587
WAS. I KNOW THERE'S OBVIOUSLY

01:59:54.654 --> 01:59:55.821
SOME QUESTIONS FROM ASSEMBLY

01:59:55.888 --> 01:59:57.256
MEMBER BONTA AROUND THE DATA AND

01:59:57.323 --> 02:00:00.493
SOME OF THAT, WHICH, YOU KNOW, I

02:00:00.560 --> 02:00:01.994
THOUGHT SHE SHE DID A REALLY

02:00:02.061 --> 02:00:03.362
GOOD JOB OF POINTING THAT OUT

02:00:03.429 --> 02:00:05.731
THAT I KNOW YOU'LL LOOK INTO.

02:00:05.798 --> 02:00:09.435
AND SO THE SECOND PIECE THAT I

02:00:09.502 --> 02:00:14.006
HAD WAS REALLY AROUND THE COST

02:00:14.073 --> 02:00:18.044
SAVINGS THAT TNCS WOULD RECEIVE

02:00:18.110 --> 02:00:22.281
AS A RESULT OF THIS BILL. DO YOU

02:00:22.348 --> 02:00:24.183
ALL KNOW WHAT THE COST SAVINGS

02:00:24.250 --> 02:00:27.019
ARE FOR YOUR COMPANIES ON THIS?

02:00:27.086 --> 02:00:30.289
HAVE YOU DONE ANY ANALYSIS? YES,

02:00:30.356 --> 02:00:32.358
I'D BE HAPPY TO SHARE THAT WITH

02:00:32.425 --> 02:00:33.960
YOU INDIVIDUALLY. BUT AS SENATOR

02:00:34.026 --> 02:00:35.761
CABALDON SAID, WITH US IN THE

02:00:35.828 --> 02:00:38.397
ROOM, THAT'S HIGHLY COMPETITIVE

02:00:38.464 --> 02:00:39.332
AND SENSITIVE INFORMATION, BUT I

02:00:39.398 --> 02:00:42.268
CAN DEFINITELY FOLLOW UP WITH

02:00:42.335 --> 02:00:43.603
YOU AND SHARE THAT WITH YOU.

02:00:43.669 --> 02:00:45.938
OKAY. THE REASON WHY I ASKED

02:00:46.005 --> 02:00:47.206
THAT, BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE ASKING

02:00:47.273 --> 02:00:49.175
US TO CONSIDER, OBVIOUSLY, IS,

02:00:49.241 --> 02:00:50.943
IS ONE AROUND MAKING SURE THAT

02:00:51.010 --> 02:00:52.612
THERE'S ALIGNMENT IN THE

02:00:52.678 --> 02:00:53.813
INSURANCE MARKET AS IT RELATES

02:00:53.879 --> 02:00:55.147
TO THE VEHICLES THAT YOU ALL

02:00:55.214 --> 02:00:57.416
INSURE, AND MAKING SURE THAT WE

02:00:57.483 --> 02:00:58.584
CONTINUE TO PROTECT DRIVERS AND

02:00:58.651 --> 02:01:00.152
OTHER CONSUMER CONSUMERS ON THE

02:01:00.219 --> 02:01:01.754
ROAD. AND THIS IS DIRECTLY GOING

02:01:01.821 --> 02:01:03.823
TO RESULT IN COST SAVINGS THAT I

02:01:03.889 --> 02:01:04.557
KNOW WE'RE ALL CONCERNED ABOUT,

02:01:04.624 --> 02:01:05.491
WHICH IS REALLY MY THIRD

02:01:05.558 --> 02:01:07.126
QUESTION AROUND WORKER

02:01:07.193 --> 02:01:08.928
PROTECTIONS. AND THANK YOU TO

02:01:08.995 --> 02:01:10.730
THE CHAIR FOR EXPLAINING THE

02:01:10.796 --> 02:01:12.131
QUESTIONS AROUND THE INTENT

02:01:12.198 --> 02:01:14.266
LANGUAGE, WHICH I ALSO HAD

02:01:14.333 --> 02:01:17.503
QUESTIONS WITH. BUT CAN YOU JUST

02:01:17.570 --> 02:01:19.005
ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT MORE

02:01:19.071 --> 02:01:20.840
ABOUT WHERE WHERE WILL THESE

02:01:20.906 --> 02:01:22.808
DOLLARS GO? LIKE, I WOULD LIKE

02:01:22.875 --> 02:01:25.211
TO HEAR, YOU KNOW, ON THE RECORD

02:01:25.277 --> 02:01:27.580
FROM BOTH COMPANIES WHERE THE

02:01:27.647 --> 02:01:30.483
PLAN IS TO INVEST THESE DOLLARS

02:01:30.549 --> 02:01:35.121
AND YEAH, PLEASE GO AHEAD. I'LL

02:01:35.187 --> 02:01:36.922
START WITH EXCERPTS FROM MY

02:01:36.989 --> 02:01:38.758
TESTIMONY ON THE COST TO RIDERS

02:01:38.824 --> 02:01:41.594
TODAY. SO IN IN YOUR DISTRICT

02:01:41.661 --> 02:01:43.362
ASSEMBLY MEMBER, 45% OF EVERY

02:01:43.429 --> 02:01:45.464
TRIP GOES TO GOVERNMENT MANDATED

02:01:45.531 --> 02:01:47.066
INSURANCE. WE'RE ADDRESSING ONE

02:01:47.133 --> 02:01:48.501
OF THE TWO MAIN PROVISIONS

02:01:48.567 --> 02:01:51.103
REQUIRED BY THIS LEGISLATURE. SO

02:01:51.170 --> 02:01:52.738
WE WILL SEE SAVINGS RIDERS WILL

02:01:52.805 --> 02:01:54.140
SEE SAVINGS DIRECTLY IN THEIR

02:01:54.206 --> 02:01:56.709
BOOKING FEE AS THESE INSURANCES

02:01:56.776 --> 02:01:58.944
COME DOWN. AND I THINK THE

02:01:59.011 --> 02:02:00.379
IMPERFECT SYSTEM RIGHT NOW THAT

02:02:00.446 --> 02:02:02.014
WE'RE TALKING THROUGH IS THE

02:02:02.081 --> 02:02:04.316
STUDY AND THE STUDY BEING AN

02:02:04.383 --> 02:02:06.252
AREA TO AUDIT WHAT THOSE SAVINGS

02:02:06.318 --> 02:02:08.521
LOOK LIKE. AND AS THE SENATOR

02:02:08.587 --> 02:02:10.022
MENTIONED, BECAUSE WE'RE NOT

02:02:10.089 --> 02:02:11.223
REGULATED ON INDIVIDUAL COSTS

02:02:11.290 --> 02:02:13.025
AND THERE'S DYNAMIC PRICING, IT

02:02:13.092 --> 02:02:15.094
IT ISN'T GOING TO BE A DIRECT

02:02:15.161 --> 02:02:16.696
LINEAR ANSWER, BUT IN TERMS OF

02:02:16.762 --> 02:02:18.364
TRANSPARENCY AND WHERE IT WILL

02:02:18.431 --> 02:02:21.600
EXIST, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE IT

02:02:21.667 --> 02:02:22.234
ON EVERY SINGLE TRIP. SEPARATE

02:02:22.301 --> 02:02:24.336
FROM THAT. ON THE DRIVER

02:02:24.403 --> 02:02:27.339
BENEFIT. RIGHT NOW, THE

02:02:27.406 --> 02:02:29.175
MARKETPLACE IS SUFFERING,

02:02:29.241 --> 02:02:30.543
PARTICULARLY IN YOUR DISTRICT,

02:02:30.609 --> 02:02:31.744
BECAUSE OF THE INCREASED COSTS

02:02:31.811 --> 02:02:34.513
OF TRIPS WHERE THERE IS LESS

02:02:34.580 --> 02:02:36.415
DEMAND, LESS PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND

02:02:36.482 --> 02:02:37.950
ME AND OUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY

02:02:38.017 --> 02:02:39.985
MEMBERS THAT ARE ORDERING TRIPS

02:02:40.052 --> 02:02:40.986
BECAUSE THERE'S OBVIOUSLY ONLY

02:02:41.053 --> 02:02:42.655
SO MUCH PRICE ELASTICITY, HOW

02:02:42.722 --> 02:02:43.956
MUCH WE'RE ALL WE'RE WILLING TO

02:02:44.023 --> 02:02:45.791
PAY TO GET SOMEWHERE. SO YOU END

02:02:45.858 --> 02:02:47.626
UP WITH AN OVERSUPPLIED MARKET.

02:02:47.693 --> 02:02:48.794
SO HOW DO WE HAVE MORE

02:02:48.861 --> 02:02:51.030
AFFORDABLE TRIPS THAT MORE

02:02:51.097 --> 02:02:52.531
RIDERS ARE INTERESTED IN TAKING,

02:02:52.598 --> 02:02:54.700
AND ACCESS TO MORE WORK FOR

02:02:54.767 --> 02:02:56.469
DRIVERS, ALONG WITH THE FACT

02:02:56.535 --> 02:02:58.370
THAT A DRIVER WILL NEVER BE

02:02:58.437 --> 02:02:59.739
REQUIRED TO CARRY THIS POLICY,

02:02:59.805 --> 02:03:01.173
UNLIKE THE CURRENT LAW WHERE

02:03:01.240 --> 02:03:02.975
IT'S THE DRIVER, THE COMPANY, OR

02:03:03.042 --> 02:03:05.211
SOME COMBINATION OF THE TWO, AND

02:03:05.277 --> 02:03:07.046
WE'RE OPEN FOR ADDITIONAL IDEAS

02:03:07.113 --> 02:03:09.815
ON HOW TO MAKE THINGS MORE

02:03:09.882 --> 02:03:10.449
CONCRETE THERE. THERE HAVE BEEN

02:03:10.516 --> 02:03:12.351
A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS,

02:03:12.418 --> 02:03:14.120
PARTICULARLY IN THE LAST 6 TO 8

02:03:14.186 --> 02:03:15.588
WEEKS, AND OUR DOOR'S OPEN TO

02:03:15.654 --> 02:03:17.022
CONTINUE THOSE DISCUSSIONS. BUT

02:03:17.089 --> 02:03:19.125
THAT THAT FROM A 50,000 FOOT

02:03:19.191 --> 02:03:20.626
VIEW, I THINK THOSE ARE THE MOST

02:03:20.693 --> 02:03:22.094
CONCRETE ANSWERS I COULD GIVE

02:03:22.161 --> 02:03:25.397
YOU. OKAY. AND WE CHARACTERIZE

02:03:25.464 --> 02:03:26.832
THE INSURANCE COST PER RIDE A

02:03:26.899 --> 02:03:28.534
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY. AT LYFT.

02:03:28.601 --> 02:03:31.337
IT'S $6 PER RIDE ON AVERAGE IN

02:03:31.403 --> 02:03:33.205
CALIFORNIA GOES TO INSURANCE

02:03:33.272 --> 02:03:35.341
COSTS. AND IN SOUTHERN

02:03:35.407 --> 02:03:37.209
CALIFORNIA, MOST NOTABLY IN YOUR

02:03:37.276 --> 02:03:38.177
DISTRICT ASSEMBLY MEMBER, IT'S

02:03:38.244 --> 02:03:42.615
AROUND $7. AND SO AND THE WAY

02:03:42.681 --> 02:03:45.017
OUR BUSINESS WORKS AND THE WAY

02:03:45.084 --> 02:03:46.118
OUR MARKETPLACE WORKS, IT DOES

02:03:46.185 --> 02:03:48.154
NOT MAKE A LOT OF SENSE TO

02:03:48.220 --> 02:03:50.756
CONTINUE RAISING FARES. AND THE

02:03:50.823 --> 02:03:52.591
COST OF INSURANCE IS GOING TO

02:03:52.658 --> 02:03:54.994
MAKE US DO THAT. AND IF WE SAVE

02:03:55.060 --> 02:03:56.662
FROM INSURANCE COSTS, THEN WE'D

02:03:56.729 --> 02:03:59.064
BE ABLE TO MAKE OUR PRICES MORE

02:03:59.131 --> 02:04:00.232
COMPETITIVE, MORE COMPETITIVE,

02:04:00.299 --> 02:04:02.134
UBER, BUT ALSO REDUCE THEM FOR

02:04:02.201 --> 02:04:03.435
RIDERS. AND IF WE REDUCE OUR

02:04:03.502 --> 02:04:05.137
COSTS, WE REDUCE THOSE PRICES.

02:04:05.204 --> 02:04:06.605
AND IF WE REDUCE THOSE PRICES,

02:04:06.672 --> 02:04:08.474
WE GET MORE RIDERS AND THAT'S

02:04:08.541 --> 02:04:09.408
MORE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN FOR

02:04:09.475 --> 02:04:12.478
DRIVERS, IN ADDITION TO THE

02:04:12.545 --> 02:04:13.445
REDUCTION OF OVERHEAD WHEN IT

02:04:13.512 --> 02:04:15.848
COMES TO INSURANCE COSTS. THANK

02:04:15.915 --> 02:04:18.217
YOU BOTH FOR SHARING THAT. I

02:04:18.284 --> 02:04:19.318
KNOW IT'S HARD TO SHARE

02:04:19.385 --> 02:04:21.787
SPECIFIC, SPECIFIC DATA ON THE

02:04:21.854 --> 02:04:23.956
COST SAVINGS RIGHT NOW, GIVEN

02:04:24.023 --> 02:04:27.293
THE LIMITATIONS, BUT, YOU KNOW,

02:04:27.359 --> 02:04:28.761
I'LL JUST GO AHEAD AND CONCLUDE

02:04:28.828 --> 02:04:31.096
AND SHARE AND ADD TO THE ECHO OF

02:04:31.163 --> 02:04:33.265
WHAT MY COLLEAGUES ALREADY

02:04:33.332 --> 02:04:35.100
SHARED, REALLY AROUND THE

02:04:35.167 --> 02:04:37.102
IMPORTANCE OF THE COST SAVINGS

02:04:37.169 --> 02:04:38.604
SHOULD THIS BILL MOVE THE

02:04:38.671 --> 02:04:41.507
THROUGH THE PROCESS AND, AND,

02:04:41.574 --> 02:04:45.211
YOU KNOW, GET SIGNED THAT I WILL

02:04:45.277 --> 02:04:46.545
BE FOLLOWING THIS BILL

02:04:46.612 --> 02:04:47.847
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE PROCESS

02:04:47.913 --> 02:04:49.448
AND KNOW THAT WE HAVE A GOOD

02:04:49.515 --> 02:04:51.050
AUTHOR WHO WILL LIVE UP TO HIS

02:04:51.116 --> 02:04:52.885
COMMITMENT IN ENSURING THAT WE

02:04:52.952 --> 02:04:54.019
PROTECT WORKERS, AND THAT THESE

02:04:54.086 --> 02:04:56.989
PASS THROUGH DOLLARS GO DIRECTLY

02:04:57.056 --> 02:04:58.757
TO THE DRIVERS AND TO THE

02:04:58.824 --> 02:05:00.392
WORKFORCE. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE

02:05:00.459 --> 02:05:02.194
THE LANGUAGE STRENGTHENED SO

02:05:02.261 --> 02:05:03.963
THAT IT IS ENFORCEABLE. WOULD

02:05:04.029 --> 02:05:06.465
LOVE TO ALSO SEE FLEXIBILITY IN

02:05:06.532 --> 02:05:07.766
THE LANGUAGE AROUND THE

02:05:07.833 --> 02:05:09.268
INSURANCE COVERAGE SO THAT

02:05:09.335 --> 02:05:10.936
CHANGE FOR WHATEVER REASON, YOU

02:05:11.003 --> 02:05:13.606
KNOW. SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING

02:05:13.672 --> 02:05:16.308
THE BILL TODAY AND ECHO THE

02:05:16.375 --> 02:05:17.209
THOUGHTS FROM MY OTHER

02:05:17.276 --> 02:05:18.143
COLLEAGUES, BUT WE'LL BE

FOLLOWING THIS BILL CLOSELY

02:05:19.845 --> 02:05:21.380
SHOULD THINGS NOT MAKE PROGRESS.

02:13:56.328 --> 02:13:57.362
REGISTERED. DID YOU HAVE A

02:13:57.429 --> 02:13:59.965
SECOND WITNESS? HE TOOK THIS. HE

02:14:00.031 --> 02:14:03.034
TOOK HIS BREAKS. HE TOOK HIS

02:14:03.101 --> 02:14:07.139
BREAK TOO. THAT'S OKAY. OKAY. SO

02:14:07.205 --> 02:14:09.241
WHEN HE COMES IN, HE CAN JOIN

02:14:09.307 --> 02:14:11.276
US. OR IF YOU HAVE ANOTHER

02:14:11.343 --> 02:14:12.177
WITNESS, THEY CAN JOIN US.

02:14:12.244 --> 02:14:13.578
SENATOR DURAZZO, YOU MAY BEGIN.

02:14:13.645 --> 02:14:16.114
YES. IF I CAN HAVE A SOMEONE WHO

02:14:16.181 --> 02:14:18.183
WILL ANSWER QUESTIONS. SURE,

02:14:18.250 --> 02:14:19.317
SURE. YEAH. I HAVE A SECOND

02:14:19.384 --> 02:14:22.854

02:14:22.921 --> 02:14:26.091
YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH,

SENATOR ROSINO. YOU MAY BEGIN,

02:14:27.392 --> 02:14:28.627
AND EACH OF YOUR WITNESSES WILL

02:14:28.693 --> 02:14:30.929
HAVE TWO MINUTES. GREAT. AND I

02:14:30.996 --> 02:14:32.564
WANT TO START OUT, MADAM CHAIR,

02:14:32.631 --> 02:14:34.766
AS TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE

02:14:34.833 --> 02:14:36.268
AMENDMENTS. FIRST AND FOREMOST.

02:14:36.334 --> 02:14:38.069
AND I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE ON

02:14:38.136 --> 02:14:40.639
YOUR TEAM. I KNOW THIS IS A

02:14:40.705 --> 02:14:42.073
SUBJECT THAT'S VERY DEAR TO YOU,

02:14:42.140 --> 02:14:43.341
AND YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT,

02:14:43.408 --> 02:14:45.243
AND YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP WORKING

02:14:45.310 --> 02:14:46.745
ON IT TO MAKE EVERYTHING EVEN

02:14:46.812 --> 02:14:49.247
BETTER. AND YOUR CHIEF

02:14:49.314 --> 02:14:50.615
CONSULTANT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

02:14:50.682 --> 02:14:52.384
AND EVERYONE ON YOUR YOUR STAFF,

02:14:52.451 --> 02:14:54.553
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS

02:14:54.619 --> 02:14:56.822
AND TO GUIDE US TO GET HERE

02:14:56.888 --> 02:15:00.091
WHERE WE ARE TODAY. SO I KNOW

02:15:00.158 --> 02:15:01.827
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT

02:15:01.893 --> 02:15:03.261
HERE. PICTURE THIS A TEN YEAR

02:15:03.328 --> 02:15:06.097
OLD SITTING OUTSIDE A LIBRARY AT

02:15:06.164 --> 02:15:07.599
NIGHT TRYING TO FINISH HOMEWORK

02:15:07.666 --> 02:15:10.135
ON A BORROWED PHONE, AND BECAUSE

02:15:10.202 --> 02:15:12.237
EVEN TODAY, TOO MANY FAMILIES IN

02:15:12.304 --> 02:15:14.005
CALIFORNIA STILL CANNOT AFFORD

02:15:14.072 --> 02:15:16.942
INTERNET AT HOME. 716 IS ABOUT

02:15:17.008 --> 02:15:19.077
MAKING SURE NO CHILD FALLS

02:15:19.144 --> 02:15:20.846
BEHIND SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T

02:15:20.912 --> 02:15:23.415
GET ONLINE. NEARLY 1 IN 3

02:15:23.482 --> 02:15:25.217
FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA CAN'T

02:15:25.283 --> 02:15:28.086
COUNT ON RELIABLE HOME INTERNET

02:15:28.153 --> 02:15:29.855
FOR THE KIDS TO DO SCHOOLWORK.

02:15:29.921 --> 02:15:31.590
AND WITH THE EXPIRATION OF THE

02:15:31.656 --> 02:15:35.227
FEDERAL AFFORDABLE CONNECTIVITY

02:15:35.293 --> 02:15:37.062
PROGRAM, THE ACP, ALMOST 3

02:15:37.128 --> 02:15:38.497
MILLION LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS

02:15:38.563 --> 02:15:40.699
HAVE LOST CRITICAL SUPPORT. WE

02:15:40.765 --> 02:15:42.901
AS LEGISLATORS HAVE WORKED HARD

02:15:42.968 --> 02:15:45.403
TO CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. THE

02:15:45.470 --> 02:15:46.271
GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE

02:15:46.338 --> 02:15:48.607
MADE A HISTORIC $6 BILLION

02:15:48.673 --> 02:15:50.709
INVESTMENT IN BROADBAND

02:15:50.775 --> 02:15:52.210
INFRASTRUCTURE, BUT

02:15:52.277 --> 02:15:53.578
AFFORDABILITY REMAINS THE

02:15:53.645 --> 02:15:56.848
PERSISTENT BARRIER. SO WE NEED

02:15:56.915 --> 02:15:58.283
TO CONTINUE TO DO ALL WE CAN TO

02:15:58.350 --> 02:16:00.485
MAKE SURE FAMILIES CAN ACTUALLY

02:16:00.552 --> 02:16:02.954
CONNECT TO THE WIRES THAT WE'RE

02:16:03.021 --> 02:16:06.291
BUILDING. AFFORDABILITY NOW IS

02:16:06.358 --> 02:16:08.994
THE GREATEST BARRIER. AS WE

02:16:09.060 --> 02:16:12.430
SAID, THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTE

02:16:12.497 --> 02:16:14.933
CALLED BROADBAND ESSENTIAL

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:15.901
INFRASTRUCTURE. AND WITHOUT

02:16:15.967 --> 02:16:17.369
AFFORDABLE INTERNET, STUDENTS

02:16:17.435 --> 02:16:20.005
CAN'T DO HOMEWORK. PATIENTS MISS

02:16:20.071 --> 02:16:21.473
OUT ON TELEHEALTH, AND WORKERS

02:16:21.540 --> 02:16:24.609
LOSE OPPORTUNITIES. THIS BILL

02:16:24.676 --> 02:16:26.478
CREATES THE HOME INTERNET

02:16:26.545 --> 02:16:28.213
LIFELINE PROGRAM FOR LOW INCOME

02:16:28.280 --> 02:16:30.015
FAMILIES. THE PUC WOULD ADOPT

02:16:30.081 --> 02:16:31.783
RULES TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM

02:16:31.850 --> 02:16:35.153
BY JULY 1ST, 2027. THIS BILL

02:16:35.220 --> 02:16:36.788
LETS ELIGIBLE HOUSEHOLDS USE

02:16:36.855 --> 02:16:38.924
THEIR CALIFORNIA LIFELINE

02:16:38.990 --> 02:16:40.325
SUBSIDY FOR HOME INTERNET,

02:16:40.392 --> 02:16:42.661
GIVING THEM THE FLEXIBILITY TO

02:16:42.727 --> 02:16:44.729
CHOOSE A SERVICE THAT BEST FITS

02:16:44.796 --> 02:16:46.598
THEIR NEEDS. FAMILIES COULD PAY

02:16:46.665 --> 02:16:49.367
NO MORE THAN $11 OUT OF POCKET

02:16:49.434 --> 02:16:53.004
FOR SPEEDS OF UP TO OF 100 UP 20

02:16:53.071 --> 02:16:56.241
DOWN. PARTICIPATION IS VOLUNTARY

02:16:56.308 --> 02:16:58.843
FOR ISPS. THEY CHOOSE TO

02:16:58.910 --> 02:17:00.312
PARTICIPATE, BUT THEY MUST OFFER

02:17:00.378 --> 02:17:02.380
AT LEAST $130 PLAN. WITH THE

02:17:02.447 --> 02:17:04.616
SPEEDS I MENTIONED. THIS SPEED

02:17:04.683 --> 02:17:05.984
ALLOWS CHILDREN TO DO THEIR

02:17:06.051 --> 02:17:07.819
HOMEWORK AND MOM TO GO TAKE A

02:17:07.886 --> 02:17:11.756
COLLEGE COURSE OUTLINE AND

02:17:11.823 --> 02:17:13.858
HOPEFULLY WITHOUT FREEZING OR

02:17:13.925 --> 02:17:16.127
BUFFERING OR DROPPING OFF.

02:17:16.194 --> 02:17:17.495
FAMILIES CAN APPLY LIFELINE

02:17:17.562 --> 02:17:19.598
SUPPORT DIRECTLY TO INTERNET

02:17:19.664 --> 02:17:22.267
SERVICE. WITH NO FORCED BUNDLING

02:17:22.334 --> 02:17:24.736
AND NO GIMMICKS. THE SURCHARGE

02:17:24.803 --> 02:17:25.670
TO FUND THE PROGRAM WOULD BE

02:17:25.737 --> 02:17:27.205
CAPPED AT THE HIGHEST RATE

02:17:27.272 --> 02:17:28.907
CHARGED OVER THE PAST FOUR

02:17:28.974 --> 02:17:31.276
YEARS, WHICH IS $0.60 PER ACCESS

02:17:31.343 --> 02:17:33.645
LINE. FISCAL REPORTING TO THE

02:17:33.712 --> 02:17:35.080
LEGISLATURE IS BUILT INTO THE

02:17:35.146 --> 02:17:36.881
BILL, AND THERE IS A SUNSET DATE

02:17:36.948 --> 02:17:40.685
OF JANUARY 1ST, 2032. IT'S THIS

02:17:40.752 --> 02:17:42.721
IS AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE

02:17:42.787 --> 02:17:45.223
WORKFORCE OF OUR STATE. IF KIDS

02:17:45.290 --> 02:17:47.025
CAN'T FINISH HOMEWORK TODAY,

02:17:47.092 --> 02:17:49.494
THEY CAN'T COMPETE IN TOMORROW'S

02:17:49.561 --> 02:17:52.831
ECONOMY. CLOSING THE DIGITAL

02:17:52.897 --> 02:17:54.933
DIVIDE IS NOT CHARITY. IT'S NOT

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.135
A LUXURY. IT SHOULD NOT BE A

02:17:57.202 --> 02:17:59.204
LUXURY. AND IT'S NOT FOR FUN.

02:17:59.270 --> 02:18:02.307
IT'S BUILDING CALIFORNIA UP IN

02:18:02.374 --> 02:18:03.742
THE FOURTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN

02:18:03.808 --> 02:18:06.511
THE WORLD. CALIFORNIA'S KIDS

02:18:06.578 --> 02:18:07.879
DESERVE MORE THAN PARKING LOTS

02:18:07.946 --> 02:18:10.015
AND BORROWED PHONES. THEY

02:18:10.081 --> 02:18:11.816
DESERVE A TRUE CHANCE TO

02:18:11.883 --> 02:18:13.485
SUCCEED. AND MADAM CHAIR, WITH

02:18:13.551 --> 02:18:15.020
ME TODAY, AS I MENTIONED

02:18:15.086 --> 02:18:16.721
EARLIER, RETIRED STATE SENATOR

THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MADAM CHAIR

02:18:22.661 --> 02:18:24.429

02:18:24.496 --> 02:18:26.231
OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU. I'M

02:18:26.297 --> 02:18:28.099
HERE TODAY REPRESENTING THE

02:18:28.166 --> 02:18:29.901
CALIFORNIA EMERGING TECHNOLOGY

02:18:29.968 --> 02:18:31.870
FUND, SPONSORS OF THIS MEASURE.

02:18:31.936 --> 02:18:33.705
WE WANT TO COMMEND SENATOR

02:18:33.772 --> 02:18:37.409
DURAZO FOR HER TIRELESS EFFORTS

02:18:37.475 --> 02:18:39.344
AND BEING THE CHAMPION FOR

02:18:39.411 --> 02:18:41.112
INTERNET AFFORDABILITY. WE HAVE

02:18:41.179 --> 02:18:43.682
WORKED CLOSELY WITH HER FOR TWO

02:18:43.748 --> 02:18:46.184
YEARS AND ARE VERY PLEASED TO

02:18:46.251 --> 02:18:48.920
HAVE BEFORE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY

02:18:48.987 --> 02:18:51.122
THAT WOULD PROPOSE THAT WAS

02:18:51.189 --> 02:18:52.590
PROPOSED LAST SESSION BY

02:18:52.657 --> 02:18:55.060
GOVERNOR, GOVERNOR NEWSOM AND

02:18:55.126 --> 02:18:57.662
INTERNET LIFELINE PROGRAM TO

02:18:57.729 --> 02:19:00.432
REPLACE THE FEDERAL AFFORDABLE

02:19:00.498 --> 02:19:02.701
CONNECTIVITY, IN WHICH ALMOST 3

02:19:02.767 --> 02:19:04.703
MILLION HOUSEHOLDS ENROLLED.

02:19:04.769 --> 02:19:06.938
THIS LEGISLATURE AND THE

02:19:07.005 --> 02:19:07.872
GOVERNOR HAVE BEEN TRAILBLAZERS

02:19:07.939 --> 02:19:11.643
IN THE QUEST TO GET ALL

02:19:11.710 --> 02:19:13.745
CALIFORNIANS CONNECTED. AS

02:19:13.812 --> 02:19:15.180
MENTIONED, YOU HAVE ALLOCATED

02:19:15.246 --> 02:19:17.449
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR

02:19:17.515 --> 02:19:18.883
INFRASTRUCTURE. NOW, THE

02:19:18.950 --> 02:19:22.854
REMAINING TASK IS AFFORDABILITY,

02:19:22.921 --> 02:19:25.590
AND THE PRIMARY REASON WHY SO

02:19:25.657 --> 02:19:28.126
MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE

02:19:28.193 --> 02:19:30.762
UNCONNECTED AS BECAUSE THEY

02:19:30.829 --> 02:19:34.399
CANNOT AFFORD IT. CONSIDER 35%

02:19:34.466 --> 02:19:37.502
OF THE POOREST HOUSEHOLDS CITE

02:19:37.569 --> 02:19:38.670
AFFORDABILITY AS THE PRIME

02:19:38.737 --> 02:19:41.940
REASON FOR NOT BEING CONNECTED.

02:19:42.006 --> 02:19:43.308
FURTHER, ACCORDING TO THE

02:19:43.375 --> 02:19:46.277
FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS

02:19:46.344 --> 02:19:49.447
COMMISSION, 70% OF THOSE WHO ARE

02:19:49.514 --> 02:19:50.548
CONNECTED ARE PAYING MORE OF

02:19:50.615 --> 02:19:52.684
THEIR DISPOSABLE INCOME THAN

02:19:52.751 --> 02:19:55.620
WHAT IS REASONABLE, A MUCH

02:19:55.687 --> 02:19:57.055
HIGHER PERCENTAGE THAN MOST OF

02:19:57.122 --> 02:20:00.258
US IN ALL THE YEARS. IN MY IN

02:20:00.325 --> 02:20:02.227
ALL MY YEARS IN THE LEGISLATURE,

02:20:02.293 --> 02:20:04.229
I HAVE NEVER WITNESSED A MORE

02:20:04.295 --> 02:20:06.798
INCLUSIVE PROCESS OF

02:20:06.865 --> 02:20:08.500
STAKEHOLDERS TO TRY TO REACH

02:20:08.566 --> 02:20:10.635

THE OTHER ASPECTS OF ADDRESSING

02:21:21.673 --> 02:21:23.942
THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. FINALLY, WE

02:21:24.008 --> 02:21:25.777
ARE ALSO THE CONVENER FOR THE

I'M ALSO HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF

02:21:41.092 --> 02:21:42.794
PRINCIPAL SAM FLOYD FROM LATOSHA

02:21:42.861 --> 02:21:44.996
FLOYD, NAMED AFTER HIS MOTHER.

02:21:45.063 --> 02:21:46.731
HE WAS A BENEFICIARY OF A

02:21:46.798 --> 02:21:48.299
PROJECT THAT WE WORKED ON

02:21:48.366 --> 02:21:49.367
THROUGH KTF, THE SCHOOL TO HOME

02:21:49.434 --> 02:21:51.069
PROJECT, AND HE LED THAT SCHOOL

02:21:51.135 --> 02:21:52.937
AS A TEACHER TO TRAIN OTHER

02:21:53.004 --> 02:21:54.606
TEACHERS HOW TO SUPPORT FAMILIES

02:21:54.672 --> 02:21:57.609
TO GET DEVICES AND TRAINING, TO

02:21:57.675 --> 02:22:00.111
BE ABLE TO DO HOMEWORK AT HOME.

02:22:00.178 --> 02:22:01.246
EVERYTHING WAS GOING WELL UNTIL

02:22:01.312 --> 02:22:02.747
THE INTERNET. I MEAN, THE

PANDEMIC HAPPENED. AND THEN

02:22:04.816 --> 02:22:06.718
WHAT? WE FOUND OUT THAT PARENTS

02:22:06.784 --> 02:22:08.419
DIDN'T HAVE AFFORDABLE ACCESS TO

02:22:08.486 --> 02:22:10.255
THE INTERNET AT HOME. SO UP TO

02:22:10.321 --> 02:22:12.657
40% OF THE HOUSEHOLDS WERE

02:22:12.724 --> 02:22:15.960
LOCKED OUT. THIS SCHOOL SERVES

02:22:16.027 --> 02:22:17.629
TWO LOW INCOME HOUSING PROJECTS

02:22:17.695 --> 02:22:18.796
THAT ARE ADMINISTERED BY THE

02:22:18.863 --> 02:22:20.665

HIGH PERCENTAGE OF THE

HOUSEHOLDS ARE WOMEN LED

02:22:24.936 --> 02:22:28.873

02:22:28.940 --> 02:22:29.908
TWO MILES FROM THE STATE

02:22:29.974 --> 02:22:32.143

02:22:32.210 --> 02:22:33.578

02:22:37.282 --> 02:22:39.350
MORE DEVICES TO SUPPORT THE

FAMILIES, BUT THE AFFORDABILITY

02:22:41.052 --> 02:22:43.321
IS THE BIG ISSUE FOR US. SO

02:22:43.388 --> 02:22:44.489

02:22:44.555 --> 02:22:46.457

02:28:48.419 --> 02:28:53.157
TELEPHONE BILLS HERE. WHEN THE

02:28:53.224 --> 02:28:55.960
ACCESS LINE FEE WAS PUT INTO

02:28:56.027 --> 02:29:01.766
PLACE IN APRIL OF 2023, MY

02:29:01.832 --> 02:29:05.770
TELEPHONE BILL DROPPED BY 63%

02:29:05.836 --> 02:29:09.373
FOR WHAT I WAS PAYING INTO THE

02:29:09.440 --> 02:29:12.643
UNIVERSAL SERVICE FUNDS. THEN

02:29:12.710 --> 02:29:17.648
THAT VERY SAME MONTH, MY COMCAST

02:29:17.715 --> 02:29:20.017
BILL, AN INTERNET BILL, SHOWED

02:29:20.084 --> 02:29:22.787
UP WITH AN ACCESS LINE FEE. SO

02:29:22.853 --> 02:29:26.257
THERE ARE 53.5 MILLION ACCESS

02:29:26.324 --> 02:29:28.859
LINES TODAY. ALL OF US USERS

02:29:28.926 --> 02:29:31.996
PAYING IN. IT WAS THE BIGGEST

02:29:32.063 --> 02:29:35.633
DEMOCRATIZATION OF A GREATER

02:29:35.700 --> 02:29:38.803
BASE OF CONTRIBUTORS TO A PUBLIC

02:29:38.869 --> 02:29:42.873
FUND. IT IS NOT JUST THE

02:29:42.940 --> 02:29:45.476
WIRELESS CUSTOMERS WHO ARE

02:29:45.543 --> 02:29:49.647
CONTRIBUTING TO TODAY'S LIFELINE

02:29:49.714 --> 02:29:53.284
PROGRAM. FURTHER, WHEN I WAS

02:29:53.351 --> 02:29:56.354
PAYING AN INDIVIDUAL AMOUNT

02:29:56.420 --> 02:30:01.325
BEFORE APRIL OF 2023, I PAID

02:30:01.392 --> 02:30:05.930
$1.62, $1.58, $1.87, $1.70 2 IN

02:30:05.996 --> 02:30:10.901
4 DIFFERENT MONTHS IN 2223 JUST

02:30:10.968 --> 02:30:13.804
FOR THE LIFELINE PROGRAM. WHAT

02:30:13.871 --> 02:30:16.407
IS PROPOSED TODAY WITH THE

02:30:16.474 --> 02:30:17.475
AMENDMENTS FROM THE CHAIR THAT

02:30:17.541 --> 02:30:19.243
HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED BY THE

02:30:19.310 --> 02:30:22.113
AUTHOR? IT IS AN AMAZING

02:30:22.179 --> 02:30:25.850
CONSUMER RELIEF MOVE. SO LET'S

02:30:25.916 --> 02:30:27.451
JUST SIT DOWN AND WE'LL GO

02:30:27.518 --> 02:30:29.420
THROUGH THE NUMBERS AGAIN. THE

02:30:29.487 --> 02:30:31.822
MATH DOESN'T ADD UP ON THEIR

02:30:31.889 --> 02:30:35.059
SIDE. I JUST WANT TO ADD ALSO

02:30:35.126 --> 02:30:38.195
THAT AGAIN THIS IS VOLUNTARY,

02:30:38.262 --> 02:30:40.431
BUT ALSO THERE IS A CAP ON THE

02:30:40.498 --> 02:30:43.067
SURCHARGE. SO THAT HAS A LOT TO

02:30:43.134 --> 02:30:46.237
DO WITH CONTAINING THE COST. YES

02:30:46.303 --> 02:30:48.472
I THINK THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT

02:30:48.539 --> 02:30:51.375
THAT THE SENATOR BRINGS UP IN

02:30:51.442 --> 02:30:55.613
JANUARY 1ST, 2025. THE SURCHARGE

02:30:55.679 --> 02:30:58.649
FOR JUST THE UT PORTION WAS

02:30:58.716 --> 02:31:01.385
$0.60. THE CPC JUST REDUCED IT

02:31:01.452 --> 02:31:03.320
TO $0.45. SO THIS BILL, ONE OF

02:31:03.387 --> 02:31:04.388
THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS, IS TO

02:31:04.455 --> 02:31:06.223
LEAVE THAT CAP, WHICH WAS THE

02:31:06.290 --> 02:31:07.291
BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR, WHICH IS

02:31:07.358 --> 02:31:09.693
THE HIGHEST CAP OF THE LAST FOUR

02:31:09.760 --> 02:31:11.462
YEARS IN PLACE. SO WE'RE NOT

02:31:11.529 --> 02:31:14.064
GOING TO SHIFT THE COSTS ONTO

02:31:14.131 --> 02:31:16.834
THE MIDDLE CLASS BY EXPANDING

02:31:16.901 --> 02:31:19.403
LIFELINE FROM JUST TELEPHONE

02:31:19.470 --> 02:31:21.405
ACCESS TO ALSO THE CHOICE TO

02:31:21.472 --> 02:31:23.407
BROADBAND. THANK YOU CHAIR

02:31:23.474 --> 02:31:24.708
BURNER. THIS IS LIKE A TEAM

02:31:24.775 --> 02:31:25.843
EFFORT ANSWER HERE. I JUST

02:31:25.910 --> 02:31:28.379
WANTED TO PUT THAT ON THE

02:31:28.446 --> 02:31:29.513
RECORD, GIVEN THE COMMENTS MADE

02:31:29.580 --> 02:31:31.649
BY THE OPPOSITION AND JUST, YOU

02:31:31.715 --> 02:31:33.417
KNOW, THE MAIN THEME THAT YOU

02:31:33.484 --> 02:31:34.318
HEARD US TALK ABOUT BOTH ON THIS

02:31:34.385 --> 02:31:36.287
ITEM AND THE LAST ITEM AROUND

02:31:36.353 --> 02:31:37.955
AFFORDABILITY AND MAKING SURE

02:31:38.022 --> 02:31:39.523
THAT WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT AND

02:31:39.590 --> 02:31:42.827
PASS LEGISLATION THAT MAKES THE

02:31:42.893 --> 02:31:45.296
END USER, OUR CONSUMERS, OUR

02:31:45.362 --> 02:31:47.498
CONSTITUENTS, LIVE A MORE

02:31:47.565 --> 02:31:50.000
AFFORDABLE DAY TO DAY LIFE. SO

02:31:50.067 --> 02:31:51.435
JUST WANTED TO GET THAT ON THE

02:31:51.502 --> 02:31:53.404
RECORD. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR

02:31:53.471 --> 02:31:54.772
THOROUGH RESPONSE AND I'M PROUD

02:31:54.839 --> 02:31:55.673
TO SUPPORT THE BILL. I WOULD

02:31:55.739 --> 02:31:58.008
HAVE MOVED IT, BUT IT'S ALREADY

02:31:58.075 --> 02:31:59.310
MOVED. BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR

02:31:59.376 --> 02:32:01.212
WORK ON THIS. THANK YOU, THANK

02:32:01.278 --> 02:32:04.381
YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS? OKAY.

02:32:04.448 --> 02:32:05.449
WITH THAT? SENATOR BARRASSO,

02:32:05.516 --> 02:32:07.518
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE? I THANK

02:32:07.585 --> 02:32:09.520
YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR YOUR HELP AND

02:32:09.587 --> 02:32:11.622
YOUR SUPPORT, MADAM CHAIR. AND

02:32:11.689 --> 02:32:14.258
EVERYONE AND EVERYONE ON THE

02:32:14.325 --> 02:32:15.893
TEAM. AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR

02:32:15.960 --> 02:32:17.628
YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU, SENATOR

02:32:17.695 --> 02:32:19.196
BARRASSO, FOR BRINGING THIS BILL

02:32:19.263 --> 02:32:20.898
FORWARD. I APPRECIATE OUR

02:32:20.965 --> 02:32:22.333
THOROUGH DISCUSSIONS ON THE

02:32:22.399 --> 02:32:24.902
POLICY OF THIS BILL. MORE THAN

02:32:24.969 --> 02:32:27.004
EVER, I AM COMMITTED TO ENSURING

02:32:27.071 --> 02:32:28.539
BROADBAND AFFORDABILITY, AND I

02:32:28.606 --> 02:32:30.207
THINK THIS BILL IS GOING TO

02:32:30.274 --> 02:32:32.543
BRING US FURTHER DOWN THAT PATH.

02:32:32.610 --> 02:32:34.311
I REALLY HOPE THE ISPS

02:32:34.378 --> 02:32:36.914
PARTICIPATE. AS YOU ECHOED, IT'S

02:32:36.981 --> 02:32:38.616
VOLUNTARY. SO I REALLY HOPE THAT

02:32:38.682 --> 02:32:40.751
THE ISPS DO PARTICIPATE AND

02:32:40.818 --> 02:32:42.786
CONSUMERS WILL BENEFIT. BUT WE

02:32:42.853 --> 02:32:44.355
ALSO HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IN

02:32:44.421 --> 02:32:45.990
THE PAST, THE INCENTIVE BASED

02:32:46.056 --> 02:32:47.324
PROGRAMS HAVE NOT ALWAYS LED TO

02:32:47.391 --> 02:32:49.593
THE RESULTS THAT WE WANT TO SEE.

02:32:49.660 --> 02:32:50.494
I KNOW THAT THIS COMMITTEE AND

02:32:50.561 --> 02:32:52.329
OUR STAFF WILL BE WATCHING THE

02:32:52.396 --> 02:32:54.164
IMPLEMENTATION CLOSELY. SO THE

02:32:54.231 --> 02:32:56.567
CPUC DESIGNS A PROGRAM THAT IS

02:32:56.634 --> 02:32:58.369
WORKABLE, THAT ENCOURAGES

02:32:58.435 --> 02:33:00.538
PARTICIPATION BY ISPS. THE ONLY

02:33:00.604 --> 02:33:02.406
WAY THIS BILL WILL REALIZE THE

02:33:02.473 --> 02:33:03.741
POSITIVE RESULTS THAT WE WANT TO

02:33:03.807 --> 02:33:05.509
SEE IS IF THAT HAPPENS. AT THE

02:33:05.576 --> 02:33:07.511
SAME TIME, WE ALSO NEED TO BE

02:33:07.578 --> 02:33:09.647
MINDFUL ABOUT HOW NEW COSTS

02:33:09.713 --> 02:33:10.381
IMPACT THE EXPANDING PROGRAM TO

02:33:10.447 --> 02:33:12.149
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT CLASS OF

02:33:12.216 --> 02:33:14.818
SERVICE. PERSONALLY, I REALIZE

02:33:14.885 --> 02:33:17.521
THAT OVER TIME, VOIP HAS PAID IN

02:33:17.588 --> 02:33:19.256
TO THE LIFELINE PROGRAM, HAS NOT

02:33:19.323 --> 02:33:21.325
BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS THOSE

02:33:21.392 --> 02:33:23.861
BENEFITS, BUT THERE'S ALSO AN

02:33:23.928 --> 02:33:26.063
EQUITABLE CONTRIBUTION MECHANISM

02:33:26.130 --> 02:33:27.331
FOR THE LONG TERM IN THE

02:33:27.398 --> 02:33:28.933
LIFELINE PROGRAM, AND IT RELIES

02:33:28.999 --> 02:33:31.468
HEAVILY ON TELEPHONE CUSTOMER

02:33:31.535 --> 02:33:32.403
SURCHARGES. WHILE INTERNET

02:33:32.469 --> 02:33:34.338
SERVICE PROVIDERS AND OTHER

02:33:34.405 --> 02:33:35.439
ENTITIES LIKE STREAMING

02:33:35.506 --> 02:33:37.541
SERVICES, E-COMMERCE THAT

02:33:37.608 --> 02:33:38.909
BENEFIT GREATLY FROM INCREASED

02:33:38.976 --> 02:33:40.811
ACCESS TO BROADBAND DO NOT PAY

02:33:40.878 --> 02:33:42.613
THEIR FAIR SHARE. THE

02:33:42.680 --> 02:33:44.882
CONTRIBUTION MECHANISM IS MORE

02:33:44.949 --> 02:33:46.917
MORE COMPLEX, NUT TO CRACK, AND

02:33:46.984 --> 02:33:49.587
CANNOT BE DONE THIS YEAR. SO I

02:33:49.653 --> 02:33:50.888
DON'T WANT TO PUT ALL THAT

02:33:50.955 --> 02:33:52.823
PRESSURE OF REFORMING LIFELINE

02:33:52.890 --> 02:33:55.826
TO BE A FAIR AND EQUITABLE

02:33:55.893 --> 02:33:57.728
PROGRAM ON SENATOR GRASSO'S

02:33:57.795 --> 02:34:00.698
BILL. AND SO GIVEN THAT THAT

02:34:00.764 --> 02:34:01.432
POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC

02:34:01.498 --> 02:34:02.866
CONDITIONS FOR CALIFORNIANS ARE

02:34:02.933 --> 02:34:04.535
TRYING TO GET THROUGH, HOWEVER,

02:34:04.602 --> 02:34:07.004
I DO THINK WE NEED TO HAVE THAT

02:34:07.071 --> 02:34:07.638
CONVERSATION IN THE FUTURE, AND

02:34:07.705 --> 02:34:09.273
I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS. BILL,
