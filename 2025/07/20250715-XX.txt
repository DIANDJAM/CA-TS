FRAMEWORK TO ENSURE

00:52:29.012 --> 00:52:29.846
COMPREHENSIVE AND SAFE

00:52:29.913 --> 00:52:31.414
REGULATION OF METAL SHREDDING

00:52:31.481 --> 00:52:33.984
FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA. METAL

00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:35.585
SHREDDING FACILITIES RECYCLE

00:52:35.652 --> 00:52:37.454
MILLIONS OF END OF LIFE

00:52:37.521 --> 00:52:39.122
VEHICLES, HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES

00:52:39.189 --> 00:52:40.724
AND OTHER METALLIC ITEMS

00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:42.859
PRODUCED ANNUALLY IN CALIFORNIA

00:52:42.926 --> 00:52:45.362
UNLESS RECYCLED. THESE MATERIALS

00:52:45.428 --> 00:52:47.531
RAPIDLY OVERWHELM ALL AVAILABLE

00:52:47.597 --> 00:52:49.332
LANDFILL CAPACITY, CREATING A

00:52:49.399 --> 00:52:51.535
MASSIVE ACCUMULATION OF DAMAGED

00:52:51.601 --> 00:52:53.537

00:52:53.603 --> 00:52:55.772
AND OTHER ITEMS, AND POSE A

00:52:55.839 --> 00:52:58.041
THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY.

00:52:58.108 --> 00:52:59.175
RECYCLING THESE MATERIALS

00:52:59.242 --> 00:53:00.877
PROVIDES VALUABLE RESOURCES FOR

00:53:00.944 --> 00:53:03.146
METAL MANUFACTURING. FOR

00:53:03.213 --> 00:53:04.915
INSTANCE, DURING THE LÀ FIRES,

00:53:04.981 --> 00:53:06.983
ONE FACILITY WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:08.552
TAKING HUNDREDS OF BURNED

00:53:08.618 --> 00:53:10.220
VEHICLES FROM THE CITY,

00:53:10.287 --> 00:53:11.421
TRANSFORMING THEM INTO USEFUL

00:53:11.488 --> 00:53:13.223
NEW METAL PRODUCTS. METAL

00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:15.625
SHREDDING FACILITIES ALSO ALLOW

00:53:15.692 --> 00:53:17.694
US TO RECOVER UNCOMMON MATERIALS

00:53:17.761 --> 00:53:19.296
THAT WOULD OTHERWISE NEED TO BE

00:53:19.362 --> 00:53:20.664
MINED OUT OF THE NATURAL

00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:22.065
ENVIRONMENT, SUCH AS COPPER,

00:53:22.132 --> 00:53:23.934
ALUMINUM AND ZINC. THEY PROVIDE

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.036
AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE TO REDUCE

00:53:26.102 --> 00:53:27.571
ENVIRONMENTAL WASTE AND CREATE A

00:53:27.637 --> 00:53:29.606
SUCCESSFUL CIRCULAR ECONOMY. YET

00:53:29.673 --> 00:53:31.541
METAL SHREDDING CAN ALSO POSE

00:53:31.608 --> 00:53:32.576
CONCERNS TO SURROUNDING

00:53:32.642 --> 00:53:34.544
COMMUNITIES DUE TO THE POTENTIAL

00:53:34.611 --> 00:53:35.946
RELEASE OF AIRBORNE MATERIALS

00:53:36.012 --> 00:53:37.714
AND THE RISK OF FIRES. THE

00:53:37.781 --> 00:53:39.449
CURRENT FRAMEWORK FOR HAZARDOUS

00:53:39.516 --> 00:53:40.951
WASTE DOES NOT INCLUDE METAL

00:53:41.017 --> 00:53:41.918
SHREDDING FACILITIES, AND

00:53:41.985 --> 00:53:43.386
THEREFORE THEY ARE NOT REGULATED

00:53:43.453 --> 00:53:45.522
BY DTSC AND ARE NOT REQUIRED TO

00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:47.324

00:53:52.362 --> 00:53:53.396
BEGUN TO REGULATE THE INDUSTRY

00:53:53.463 --> 00:53:54.831
USING HAZARDOUS WASTE

00:53:54.898 --> 00:53:56.333
ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY ON A

00:53:56.399 --> 00:53:58.468
FACILITY BY FACILITY BASIS. THIS

00:53:58.535 --> 00:54:00.704
HAS CREATED AN UNCERTAIN AND

00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:01.671
INCONSISTENT LEGAL ENVIRONMENT

00:54:01.738 --> 00:54:03.239
FOR THE FACILITIES THAT HAS

00:54:03.306 --> 00:54:05.342
RESULTED IN LITIGATION, PLACING

00:54:05.408 --> 00:54:07.410
CALIFORNIA'S CIRCULAR ECONOMY AT

00:54:07.477 --> 00:54:10.447
RISK. SB 404 WILL ENSURE

00:54:10.513 --> 00:54:11.381
COMPREHENSIVE OVERSIGHT AND

00:54:11.448 --> 00:54:13.183
ENFORCEMENT UNDER DDT'S

00:54:13.249 --> 00:54:14.751
AUTHORITY, WHILE RECOGNIZING THE

00:54:14.818 --> 00:54:15.652
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE

00:54:15.719 --> 00:54:17.220
FACILITIES AND FACILITIES THAT

00:54:17.287 --> 00:54:18.288
ENGAGE IN THE TREATMENT,

00:54:18.355 --> 00:54:20.757
STORAGE, AND DISPOSAL OF SOLID

00:54:20.824 --> 00:54:22.959
AND HAZARDOUS WASTE. THIS BILL

00:54:23.026 --> 00:54:24.594
WILL REQUIRE BOTH EXISTING AND

00:54:24.661 --> 00:54:26.496
NEW FACILITIES TO RECEIVE A

00:54:26.563 --> 00:54:28.198

00:54:28.264 --> 00:54:29.899
MEET CERTAIN OPERATIONAL AND

00:54:29.966 --> 00:54:31.534
PERFORMANCE STANDARDS TO DO SO,

00:54:31.601 --> 00:54:33.737
WHICH INCLUDE IMPLEMENTING FIRE

00:54:33.803 --> 00:54:35.572
PREVENTION STRATEGIES, EMERGENCY

00:54:35.639 --> 00:54:36.940

STORMWATER MANAGEMENT

00:54:38.441 --> 00:54:39.976
REQUIREMENTS. THE BILL

00:54:40.043 --> 00:54:40.944
SPECIFICALLY ESTABLISHES

00:54:41.011 --> 00:54:42.545
STANDARDS REQUIRED TO BE MET TO

00:54:42.612 --> 00:54:44.080
AVOID THE RELEASE OF MATERIALS

00:54:44.147 --> 00:54:45.882
SUCH AS METAL SHREDDER,

00:54:45.949 --> 00:54:48.184
AGGREGATE AND RESIDUE INTO THE

00:54:48.251 --> 00:54:49.519
ENVIRONMENT. FACILITIES MUST

00:54:49.586 --> 00:54:51.621
ALSO UNDERGO THE CALIFORNIA

00:54:51.688 --> 00:54:53.123
ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OR

00:54:53.189 --> 00:54:55.392
SECURITY REVIEW PROCESS. THIS

00:54:55.458 --> 00:54:57.560
BILL GIVES DTSC ROBUST

00:54:57.627 --> 00:54:58.895
ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY TO ENSURE

00:54:58.962 --> 00:55:00.363
THESE STANDARDS ARE MET,

00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:01.798
INCLUDING THE AUTHORITY TO SHUT

00:55:01.865 --> 00:55:03.933
DOWN A FACILITY THAT POSES AN

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.102
IMMINENT AND SUBSTANTIAL DANGER

00:55:06.169 --> 00:55:07.604
TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE

00:55:07.671 --> 00:55:09.272
ENVIRONMENT. THE BILL AUTHORIZES

00:55:09.339 --> 00:55:12.308
DTSC TO COLLECT FEES IN ORDER TO

00:55:12.375 --> 00:55:13.610
COVER ADMINISTRATIVE AND

00:55:13.677 --> 00:55:15.111
ENFORCEMENT COSTS. I'M PROUD TO

00:55:15.178 --> 00:55:16.880
SAY THAT A VARIETY OF

00:55:16.946 --> 00:55:17.947
STAKEHOLDERS SUPPORT THIS NEW

00:55:18.014 --> 00:55:20.483
REGULATORY PROGRAM, AND I

00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:21.618
RECOGNIZE THERE ARE THOUGHTFUL

00:55:21.685 --> 00:55:23.019
STAKEHOLDERS WHO THINK THE

00:55:23.086 --> 00:55:24.220
REGULATORY PROGRAM IN THIS BILL

00:55:24.287 --> 00:55:25.755
SHOULD BE STRONGER, AND OTHERS

00:55:25.822 --> 00:55:27.357
WHO THINK THE PROGRAM SHOULD BE

00:55:27.424 --> 00:55:28.825
LESS BURDENSOME. I'VE BEEN

00:55:28.892 --> 00:55:30.727
WORKING WITH ALL OF THE

00:55:30.794 --> 00:55:31.628
STAKEHOLDERS TO STRIKE THE RIGHT

00:55:31.695 --> 00:55:35.331

00:55:35.398 --> 00:55:37.067
IN AN EFFORT TO ADDRESS THE

00:55:37.133 --> 00:55:38.601

00:57:21.938 --> 00:57:24.674
ECONOMY. OVER 70% OF NEW STEEL

00:57:24.741 --> 00:57:26.209
PRODUCTS ARE MADE FROM RECYCLED

00:57:26.276 --> 00:57:27.243
METAL DERIVED FROM METAL

00:57:27.310 --> 00:57:29.712
SHREDDING FACILITIES. IN FACT,

00:57:29.779 --> 00:57:31.014
PACIFIC STEEL GROUP IS BUILDING

00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:32.949
THE FIRST NEW STEEL MILL IN

00:57:33.016 --> 00:57:35.151
CALIFORNIA IN 50 YEARS. THIS

00:57:35.218 --> 00:57:36.519
PROJECT HAS THE SUPPORT OF

00:57:36.586 --> 00:57:38.354
GOVERNOR NEWSOM AND WILL USE

00:57:38.421 --> 00:57:40.857
100% RECYCLED STEEL FEEDSTOCK

00:57:40.924 --> 00:57:42.325
PRODUCED BY CALIFORNIA

00:57:42.392 --> 00:57:44.160
SHREDDERS. OVER THE PAST TEN

00:57:44.227 --> 00:57:45.528
YEARS, HOWEVER, THE METAL

00:57:45.595 --> 00:57:47.030
SHREDDING INDUSTRY HAS OPERATED

00:57:47.096 --> 00:57:49.599
IN A STATE OF LEGAL AND

00:57:49.666 --> 00:57:50.567
REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY THAT PUTS

00:57:50.633 --> 00:57:52.402
THESE BUSINESSES AT SERIOUS

00:57:52.468 --> 00:57:54.637
RISK. THIS UNCERTAINTY AFFECTS

00:57:54.704 --> 00:57:56.105
LARGE AND SMALL FACILITIES ALIKE

00:57:56.172 --> 00:57:57.407
AND HAS RIPPLE EFFECTS

00:57:57.473 --> 00:57:59.242
THROUGHOUT THE SUPPLY CHAIN,

00:57:59.309 --> 00:58:00.610
INCLUDING MANY SMALL, FAMILY

00:58:00.677 --> 00:58:02.445
OWNED MINORITY BUSINESSES THAT

00:58:02.512 --> 00:58:04.147
COLLECT AND SELL SCRAP METAL TO

00:58:04.214 --> 00:58:06.816
THESE FACILITIES. SB 404 WOULD

00:58:06.883 --> 00:58:08.384
CLARIFY THE LAWS THAT APPLY TO

00:58:08.451 --> 00:58:10.053
METAL SHREDDING FACILITIES BY

00:58:10.119 --> 00:58:12.222
CREATING A CLEAR AND BALANCED

00:58:12.288 --> 00:58:14.123
REGULATORY PROGRAM BASED ON TWO

00:58:14.190 --> 00:58:16.226
GUIDING PRINCIPLES. FIRST, THE

00:58:16.292 --> 00:58:18.862
NEED TO OPERATE IN A MANNER THAT

00:58:18.928 --> 00:58:19.429
PROTECTS THE ENVIRONMENT AND

00:58:19.495 --> 00:58:21.297
SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES, AND

00:58:21.364 --> 00:58:23.032
SECOND, RECOGNITION OF THE

00:58:23.099 --> 00:58:24.868
ECONOMIC REALITIES OF THE GLOBAL

00:58:24.934 --> 00:58:26.703
METALS COMMODITIES MARKET IN

00:58:26.769 --> 00:58:29.172
WHICH THESE FACILITIES OPERATE.

00:58:29.239 --> 00:58:31.708
WITH SB 404, CALIFORNIA WILL

00:58:31.774 --> 00:58:32.709
MAINTAIN ITS PLACE IN THE

00:58:32.775 --> 00:58:34.577
FOREFRONT OF ENVIRONMENTAL

00:58:34.644 --> 00:58:36.312
PROTECTION WHILE FOSTERING METAL

00:58:36.379 --> 00:58:37.780
SHREDDER METAL SHREDDING

00:58:37.847 --> 00:58:39.215
INDUSTRY'S CRITICAL ROLE IN THE

00:58:39.282 --> 00:58:41.484
CIRCULAR ECONOMY. THE BILL SETS

00:58:41.551 --> 00:58:43.286
A HIGH BUT ACHIEVABLE BAR FOR

00:58:43.353 --> 00:58:45.255
METAL SHREDDING FACILITIES IN

00:58:45.321 --> 00:58:46.823
CALIFORNIA, CONSISTENT WITH THE

00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:47.957
STATE'S ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES

00:58:48.024 --> 00:58:51.427
AND GOALS. WITHOUT SB 404,

00:58:51.494 --> 00:58:53.296
CALIFORNIA COULD LOSE A CRITICAL

00:58:53.363 --> 00:58:55.064
SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY THAT

00:58:55.131 --> 00:58:56.532
PROTECTS OUR COMMUNITIES AND

00:58:56.599 --> 00:58:58.268
OPEN SPACES FROM BEING

00:58:58.334 --> 00:59:00.136
OVERWHELMED BY MILLIONS OF TONS

00:59:00.203 --> 00:59:01.971
OF SCRAP METAL THAT IS GENERATED

00:59:02.038 --> 00:59:03.606
EVERY YEAR IN THE STATE. JUST

00:59:03.673 --> 00:59:05.208
THINK OF THE FLOODS AND FIRES

00:59:05.275 --> 00:59:07.277
THAT NOW RAVAGE THE STATE ON AN

00:59:07.343 --> 00:59:09.545
ALL TOO FREQUENT BASIS, LEAVING

00:59:09.612 --> 00:59:11.648
MASS DESTRUCTION IN THEIR WAKE.

00:59:11.714 --> 00:59:12.548
WITHOUT OUR METAL SHREDDERS,

00:59:12.615 --> 00:59:14.284
THERE WOULD BE NO PLACE TO

00:59:14.350 --> 00:59:15.551
PROCESS THE BURNED OR RUINED

00:59:15.618 --> 00:59:18.154
CARS AND APPLIANCES, VASTLY

00:59:18.221 --> 00:59:19.188
INCREASING THE COST AND

00:59:19.255 --> 00:59:20.657
DIFFICULTY OF CLEANING UP AFTER

00:59:20.723 --> 00:59:23.159
THESE NATURAL DISASTERS. THE

00:59:23.226 --> 00:59:24.227
COALITION HAS WORKED CLOSELY

00:59:24.294 --> 00:59:25.728
WITH THE AUTHOR AND ADDRESSING

00:59:25.795 --> 00:59:27.530
FEEDBACK FROM STAKEHOLDERS, AND

00:59:27.597 --> 00:59:29.232
HAS SUPPORTED MANY AMENDMENTS TO

00:59:29.299 --> 00:59:30.733
ADDRESS CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:32.535
RAISED. WE WISH TO EMPHASIZE

00:59:32.602 --> 00:59:35.171
THAT SB 404 DOES NOT CREATE A

00:59:35.238 --> 00:59:37.307
ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH.

00:59:37.373 --> 00:59:39.108
RATHER, IT WOULD REQUIRE DTSC TO

00:59:39.175 --> 00:59:41.144
CONSIDER THE SIZE AND NATURE OF

00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:43.413
FACILITIES IN CRAFTING PERMIT

00:59:43.479 --> 00:59:44.847
CONDITIONS AND WHEN SETTING

00:59:44.914 --> 00:59:46.516
FEES. THE COALITION WILL

00:59:46.582 --> 00:59:48.051
CONTINUE ITS COLLABORATIVE

00:59:48.117 --> 00:59:49.886
APPROACH AND WILL WORK WITH THE

00:59:49.953 --> 00:59:51.554
SENATOR TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES IN

00:59:51.621 --> 00:59:53.089
THE COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS AND BY

00:59:53.156 --> 00:59:55.625
OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. IN SUMMARY,

00:59:55.692 --> 00:59:58.161
SB 404 PROVIDES ENFORCEABLE

00:59:58.227 --> 00:59:59.562
STANDARDS THAT WILL BOTH PROTECT

00:59:59.629 --> 01:00:01.364
NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES AND

01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:03.132
ADVANCE CRITICAL RECYCLING IN

01:00:03.199 --> 01:00:05.101
CALIFORNIA. THE LEGAL AND

REGULATORY CERTAINTY THIS BILL

01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:08.237
PROVIDES IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE

01:00:08.304 --> 01:00:09.639
FUTURE VIABILITY OF THIS

01:00:09.706 --> 01:00:11.007
CRITICAL INDUSTRY AND THE

01:00:11.074 --> 01:00:12.875

01:00:14.344 --> 01:00:16.112
RELY UPON IT. WE URGE AN AYE

01:00:31.928 --> 01:00:32.962
LEGISLATIVE SESSION OBVIOUSLY

01:00:33.029 --> 01:00:34.330
HAS BEEN AFFORDABILITY. THIS

01:00:34.397 --> 01:00:35.598
APROPOS THAT THIS IS THE THIS

01:00:35.665 --> 01:00:38.534
BILL IS MOVING FORWARD IN AS FAR

01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:41.270
AS IT HAS THIS YEAR FROM THE

01:00:41.337 --> 01:00:43.806
INDUSTRIES THAT I REPRESENT,

01:00:43.873 --> 01:00:46.242
THIS REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY HAS

01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:48.811
ADDED AN EXTREME LEVEL OF COST.

01:00:48.878 --> 01:00:51.047
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, ELECTRICAL

01:00:51.114 --> 01:00:51.714

CONTRACTORS, AND OUR

01:00:55.451 --> 01:00:56.319
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS FOR THAT

01:00:56.386 --> 01:00:59.022
MATTER DISPOSE OF AND NEED TO

01:00:59.088 --> 01:01:00.323
DISPOSE OF A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT

01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:04.660
OF METAL MATERIAL. YOU KNOW, THE

01:01:04.727 --> 01:01:06.829
COSTS TO THIS INDUSTRY THAT HAS

01:01:06.896 --> 01:01:08.831
HAS BECAUSE OF THIS REGULATORY

01:01:08.898 --> 01:01:10.600
CLOUD THAT HAS BEEN OVER THE

01:01:10.666 --> 01:01:14.037
SHREDDING INDUSTRY HAS A REAL

01:01:14.103 --> 01:01:16.973
MATERIAL EFFECT ON ON HOW WE BID

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.542
JOBS AND ON OUR OPERATIONS. YOU

01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:21.377

AND DISAGREEMENTS REGARDING

01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:29.685
PRECIOUS METAL THEFT. BUT THIS

01:01:29.752 --> 01:01:31.421
IS, I THINK, INDICATIVE OF THE

01:01:31.487 --> 01:01:33.423
WORK THAT THE AUTHOR HAS DONE. I

01:01:33.489 --> 01:01:35.691
THINK THIS IS BASICALLY

01:01:35.758 --> 01:01:37.126
DEMONSTRATIVE OF THE BEST THAT

01:01:37.193 --> 01:01:38.594
THIS LEGISLATIVE PROCESS HAS TO

OFFER, THAT ON SUCH A DIFFICULT

01:01:41.064 --> 01:01:44.033
ISSUE. THIS BILL HAS COME SO FAR

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:46.135
THAT IT REALLY DESERVES TO BE

01:01:46.202 --> 01:01:48.337
PASSED. IT'S NOT A PERFECT BILL,

01:01:48.404 --> 01:01:49.739
BUT THIS IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE

01:01:49.806 --> 01:01:50.840
WHERE YOU CAN'T ALLOW THE

01:01:50.907 --> 01:01:53.009
PERFECT TO BE THE ENEMY OF THE

01:01:53.076 --> 01:01:54.811
GOOD. THIS MOVES THE STATE

01:01:54.877 --> 01:01:58.347
FORWARD. THE FIRE COMMUNITY IS

01:01:58.414 --> 01:02:02.618
SATISFIED IT IT THE DEPARTMENT.

01:02:02.685 --> 01:02:05.588
THIS IS AN ELEGANT SOLUTION AND

01:02:05.655 --> 01:02:08.157
OUR INDUSTRY URGES AND I VOTE.

01:02:08.224 --> 01:02:11.094

01:11:43.332 --> 01:11:45.234
THESE FACILITIES AND YOU REALIZE

01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:48.103
HOW MUCH, HOW MUCH WE UTILIZE IT

01:11:48.170 --> 01:11:50.239
AND THEN HOW MUCH WE THROW IT

01:11:50.305 --> 01:11:52.641
AWAY AFTERWARDS. ALL OF THE

01:11:52.708 --> 01:11:55.310
FENCING THAT'S USED AROUND,

01:11:55.377 --> 01:11:58.213
AROUND SITES THAT THE IS, ARE,

01:11:58.280 --> 01:11:59.815
IS MADE OF METAL, RIGHT? IT'S

01:11:59.882 --> 01:12:03.552
CHAIN LINK FENCES. EVERYTHING IN

01:12:03.619 --> 01:12:05.454
OUR HOUSE THAT'S A LARGE

01:12:05.521 --> 01:12:07.423
UTILITY. REFRIGERATORS, DRYERS,

01:12:07.489 --> 01:12:10.426
WASHERS. THAT'S METAL. THE CARS,

01:12:10.492 --> 01:12:13.529
THE BUSSES, THE TRAINS, THE

01:12:13.595 --> 01:12:14.930
TRACKS. THAT'S ALL MADE OF

01:12:14.997 --> 01:12:17.533
METAL. AND SO WHEN WE NO LONGER

01:12:17.599 --> 01:12:19.334
NEED THOSE PRODUCTS, WHEN

01:12:19.401 --> 01:12:21.637
THEY'RE DAMAGED, LIKE IN A

01:12:21.704 --> 01:12:24.039
EITHER A FLOOD OR A FIRE, THEN

01:12:24.106 --> 01:12:25.941
THEY NEED TO BE RECYCLED. AND

01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:28.043
WHEN THEY'RE AT THE END OF THEIR

01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:29.344
LIFE AND WE'RE, WE'RE GETTING TO

01:12:29.411 --> 01:12:32.581
THE END OF LIFE MUCH QUICKER. I

01:12:32.648 --> 01:12:34.316
REMEMBER OUR WASHING MACHINES

01:12:34.383 --> 01:12:36.685
USED TO LAST A LONG TIME AND

01:12:36.752 --> 01:12:38.721
THEY JUST DON'T ANYMORE. AND SO

01:12:38.787 --> 01:12:41.724
THERE'S BUT BUT THE, THE, THE

01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:43.225
COMPLEXITY OF THE JOB IS THAT

01:12:43.292 --> 01:12:45.627
IT'S NOT JUST THE METAL IN CARS,

01:12:45.694 --> 01:12:47.896
IT'S ALSO THE, THE, THE INSIDES,

01:12:47.963 --> 01:12:49.364
THINGS THAT ARE PLASTIC, THINGS

01:12:49.431 --> 01:12:52.835
THAT ARE MADE OF MATERIAL,

01:12:52.901 --> 01:12:56.004
RUBBER. ALL OF THAT HAS TO BE

01:12:56.071 --> 01:12:57.806
AGGREGATED, TAKEN APART AND

01:12:57.873 --> 01:13:00.275
SEPARATED. AND THEN THE METAL

01:13:00.342 --> 01:13:02.911
GETS PUT THROUGH A PROCESS WHERE

01:13:02.978 --> 01:13:05.380
IT'S SHREDDED AND THEN CAN BE

01:13:05.447 --> 01:13:07.850
SENT OFF FOR RECYCLING TO BE

01:13:07.916 --> 01:13:09.718
MELTED DOWN AND RECYCLED. BUT

01:13:09.785 --> 01:13:12.121
ALL THE REST OF THE PRODUCTS

01:13:12.187 --> 01:13:13.989
NEED TO BE DISPOSED OF AS WELL.

01:13:14.056 --> 01:13:15.591
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING

01:13:15.657 --> 01:13:19.294
ABOUT TODAY IS, IS ARE THE

01:13:19.361 --> 01:13:20.729
BYPRODUCTS OF TAKING THINGS

01:13:20.796 --> 01:13:25.834
APART AND BREAKING THEM DOWN

01:13:25.901 --> 01:13:27.736
INTO OTHER PARTS AND REUSING

01:13:27.803 --> 01:13:30.105
THEM AND REUSING THEM AS WELL.

01:13:30.172 --> 01:13:31.273
YES. SO ONE MORE, ONE MORE

01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:34.476
QUESTION. DO YOU FEEL LIKE THE

01:13:34.543 --> 01:13:35.911
SMALLER THAT YOU'VE ADDRESSED,

01:13:35.978 --> 01:13:37.846
THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE

01:13:37.913 --> 01:13:40.315
SMALLER SHREDDERS? WELL, WE'RE

01:13:40.382 --> 01:13:41.583
WE'RE WORKING ON IT. THE

01:13:41.650 --> 01:13:45.154
CHALLENGE IS, IS THAT THE

01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:46.622
SMALLER SHREDDERS DON'T DO THE

01:13:46.688 --> 01:13:48.490
EXACT SAME PROCESS THAT THE

01:13:48.557 --> 01:13:50.726
BIGGER SHREDDERS DO. AND IT'S

01:13:50.793 --> 01:13:54.997
OUR ANALYSIS THAT WE'VE TRIED TO

01:13:55.063 --> 01:13:57.166
IDENTIFY THE PROCESSES THAT

01:13:57.232 --> 01:13:59.935
CREATE THE POTENTIAL FOR WASTE

01:14:00.002 --> 01:14:01.737
PRODUCT GETTING OUTSIDE OF THE

01:14:01.804 --> 01:14:04.740
FACILITY. AND IF THE SMALL

01:14:04.807 --> 01:14:05.808
SHREDDERS ARE NOT DOING THAT,

01:14:05.874 --> 01:14:07.176
THEN THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO

01:14:07.242 --> 01:14:08.410
WORRY ABOUT IT BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:14:08.477 --> 01:14:12.347
NOT DOING IT. AND IT'S, THEY'RE,

01:14:12.414 --> 01:14:14.149
THEY'RE THEY WOULD GO THROUGH

01:14:14.216 --> 01:14:15.951
THE SAME PERMITTING PROCESS. BUT

01:14:16.018 --> 01:14:17.553
ALL PART OF THE PROCESS IS

01:14:17.619 --> 01:14:19.154
SAYING, WE DON'T DO THIS. WE

01:14:19.221 --> 01:14:21.190
DON'T DO A CHEMICAL COMPONENT.

01:14:21.256 --> 01:14:23.058
IF IN FACT, THEY DON'T AND WE

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:25.527
DON'T WE DON'T SHRED, WE JUST

01:14:25.594 --> 01:14:28.564
SEPARATE. AND WE BUNDLE AND SELL

01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:31.300
OFF THE METAL IN ITS IN A

01:14:31.366 --> 01:14:33.101
DIFFERENT FORM. SO THAT'S

01:14:33.168 --> 01:14:36.438
THEREIN LIES THE QUESTION IS, IS

01:14:36.505 --> 01:14:38.173
WHAT THEY WOULD PREFER IS JUST

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:39.975
TO BE EXEMPT? TOTALLY. AND WHAT

01:14:40.042 --> 01:14:41.210
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO IS TO

01:14:41.276 --> 01:14:45.080
CREATE A MODEL FOR THAT WHERE IF

01:14:45.147 --> 01:14:47.182
THEY MOVE INTO ANY OF THE

01:14:47.249 --> 01:14:48.684
RESTRICTED TYPE OF ACTIVITIES

01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:50.219
THAT REQUIRE A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:14:50.285 --> 01:14:52.855
OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW, THAT

01:14:52.921 --> 01:14:54.256
THAT THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH

01:14:54.323 --> 01:14:55.791
THAT ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW

01:14:55.858 --> 01:14:57.192
PROCESS IN ORDER TO GET THE

01:14:57.259 --> 01:14:58.727
CHECKOFF FROM DTSC. IN OTHER

01:14:58.794 --> 01:15:00.462
WORDS, IN OTHER WORDS, IN IN

01:15:00.529 --> 01:15:03.031
ORDER TO GET THE PERMIT THAT

01:15:03.098 --> 01:15:05.534
DTSC WOULD GIVE. SO WE'VE TRIED

01:15:05.601 --> 01:15:06.435
TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT HAVE

01:15:06.501 --> 01:15:08.871
BEEN RAISED. I THINK PART OF THE

01:15:08.937 --> 01:15:10.873
CHALLENGE IS, IS FUNDAMENTAL

01:15:10.939 --> 01:15:12.708
BELIEF THAT THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE

01:15:12.774 --> 01:15:14.877
TO BE REGULATED AT ALL, AND THAT

01:15:14.943 --> 01:15:17.779
THEREIN LIES THE CHALLENGE.

01:15:17.846 --> 01:15:20.315
OTHER QUESTIONS. VICE CHAIR.

01:15:20.382 --> 01:15:21.583
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. THANK

01:15:21.650 --> 01:15:26.021
YOU, SENATOR. THANK YOU SENATOR.

01:15:26.088 --> 01:15:31.059
MR. YES, SIR. CAN YOU TELL ME

01:15:31.126 --> 01:15:34.196
WHY SOME FOLKS IN THE SHREDDING

01:15:34.263 --> 01:15:36.798
BUSINESS USE THERMAL OXIDIZERS?

01:15:36.865 --> 01:15:39.368
SO WHEN YOU TAKE A CAR, THEY

01:15:39.434 --> 01:15:41.236
DRAIN THE FLUIDS OUT OF THE CAR

01:15:41.303 --> 01:15:42.771
BEFORE THEY SHRED IT.

01:15:42.838 --> 01:15:43.772
INHERENTLY, THEY'RE STILL GOING

01:15:43.839 --> 01:15:46.275
TO BE FLUIDS IN THE CAR. SO

01:15:46.341 --> 01:15:47.376
THERE'S REAR END FLUID, WHICH IS

01:15:47.442 --> 01:15:49.211
ALMOST A GALLON. YOU'LL HAVE

01:15:49.278 --> 01:15:50.612
RESIDUES IN THE ENGINES, RESIDUE

01:15:50.679 --> 01:15:53.382
IN THE TRANSMISSION, WHAT HAVE

01:15:53.448 --> 01:15:54.950
YOU. AND AGAIN, WHEN YOU SIT IN

01:15:55.017 --> 01:15:57.286
YOUR CAR, WHEN YOU GO HOME

01:15:57.352 --> 01:15:58.287
TODAY, I WANT YOU TO LOOK IN THE

01:15:58.353 --> 01:16:00.289
CAR. THERE'S YOUR SEAT. IT'S

01:16:00.355 --> 01:16:01.323
FOAM UNDERNEATH THE FABRIC.

01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:03.125
THERE'S CARPET ON THE FLOOR. SO

01:16:03.191 --> 01:16:06.828
WHEN YOU SHRED CARS YOU HAVE

01:16:06.895 --> 01:16:08.497
SOME OF THE OILS AND THE GASES

01:16:08.563 --> 01:16:10.265
AND WHAT HAVE YOU WILL ABSORB

01:16:10.332 --> 01:16:13.201
INTO THE CUSHIONS, INTO THE

01:16:13.268 --> 01:16:15.304
CARPET, INTO THE WHAT HAVE YOU.

01:16:15.370 --> 01:16:18.974
THEY MEGA SHREDDERS WILL TREAT

01:16:19.041 --> 01:16:21.476
THAT MATERIAL WITH, WHICH IS A

01:16:21.543 --> 01:16:22.611
HAZARDOUS WASTE. AFTER THEY'VE

01:16:22.678 --> 01:16:24.112
TAKEN ALL THE METAL OUT OF IT,

01:16:24.179 --> 01:16:26.148
THEY TREAT THAT HAZARDOUS WASTE

01:16:26.214 --> 01:16:29.084
TO MAKE IT SOLUBLE, TO GO TO A

01:16:29.151 --> 01:16:33.488
REGULAR LANDFILL AS A

01:16:33.555 --> 01:16:34.122
NON-HAZARDOUS WASTE. DO THEY MIX

01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:36.325
WET CEMENT WITH IT OR THEY MIX

01:16:36.391 --> 01:16:37.759
FLY ASH? THAT'S A SURFACTANT.

01:16:37.826 --> 01:16:39.261
THIS BILL, I'LL HAVE TO SAY, HAS

01:16:39.328 --> 01:16:41.263
SOME SOME REALLY GOOD PARTS IN

01:16:41.330 --> 01:16:44.833
IT, BECAUSE THAT'S DTZ'S JOB IS

01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:47.369
TO REGULATE HAZARDOUS WASTE, AND

01:16:47.436 --> 01:16:49.771
THE FACT THAT THEY'RE ALLOWED TO

01:16:49.838 --> 01:16:51.340
TAKE IT TO A LANDFILL, I THINK

01:16:51.406 --> 01:16:53.542
IS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL. AS LONG

01:16:53.608 --> 01:16:55.344
AS THEY'RE USING THE PROPER

01:16:55.410 --> 01:16:56.778
AMOUNT OF CHEMICALS THAT THE

01:16:56.845 --> 01:16:57.980
DTSC HAS, HAS PRESCRIBED FOR

01:16:58.046 --> 01:17:00.282
THEM. AND I THINK THEY HAVE THAT

01:17:00.349 --> 01:17:01.450
IN THE BILL. THAT'S THAT'S THE

01:17:01.516 --> 01:17:02.351
BIGGEST DIFFERENCE. A COMPANY

01:17:02.417 --> 01:17:03.986
LIKE OURS, WE DO NOT SHRED

01:17:04.052 --> 01:17:05.253
AUTOS, WE DO NOT SHRED

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:08.056
APPLIANCES, WE SHRED METAL. SO

01:17:08.123 --> 01:17:09.758
WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT ROOFING,

01:17:09.825 --> 01:17:13.729
WE DON'T OUR APPLIANCES WILL GO

01:17:13.795 --> 01:17:15.230
TO RADIUS RECYCLING. THE REASON

01:17:15.297 --> 01:17:16.999
WHY IS WE JUST DON'T WANT TO

01:17:17.065 --> 01:17:18.800
RECYCLE THEM. WE JUST DON'T WANT

01:17:18.867 --> 01:17:20.235
TO PROCESS THEM. SO YOU'RE KIND

01:17:20.302 --> 01:17:22.270
OF A BROKER THEN OF SOME STUFF

01:17:22.337 --> 01:17:23.839
AND A SHREDDER. YOU KNOW, NOT

01:17:23.905 --> 01:17:24.906
EVERYTHING FOR US. WE'RE A

01:17:24.973 --> 01:17:27.743
BOUTIQUE SHREDDER. SO WE SHRED

01:17:27.809 --> 01:17:29.978
APPROXIMATELY 3000 TONS OF

01:17:30.045 --> 01:17:31.346
MATERIAL PER MONTH. I THINK

01:17:31.413 --> 01:17:33.949
RADIUS IS AROUND 70,000 TONS PER

01:17:34.016 --> 01:17:35.984
MONTH. THEY'RE ONE OF, YOU KNOW,

01:17:36.051 --> 01:17:37.652
5 OR 6 MEGA SHREDDERS IN THE

01:17:37.719 --> 01:17:40.455
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE'VE NEVER

01:17:40.522 --> 01:17:42.157
HAD A COMPLAINT FROM A NEIGHBOR.

01:17:42.224 --> 01:17:43.992
WE'VE NEVER HAD A COMPLAINT FROM

01:17:44.059 --> 01:17:45.027
ANYBODY BECAUSE WE DON'T. SO WE

01:17:45.093 --> 01:17:47.162
DON'T CREATE VOCS BECAUSE WE

01:17:47.229 --> 01:17:49.765
DON'T SHRED VOC VOLATILE ORGANIC

01:17:49.831 --> 01:17:51.199
COMPOUNDS. CAN YOU CAN YOU TELL

01:17:51.266 --> 01:17:53.702
ME, LIKE HOW MANY AGENCIES

01:17:53.769 --> 01:17:55.837
REGULATE YOU NOW? I THINK IT'S

01:17:55.904 --> 01:17:58.340
SIX. WE HAVE AIRBORNE PERMIT,

01:17:58.407 --> 01:18:01.543
WATERBOARD PERMIT. OH, GOD.

01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:04.479
THERE'S A LIST OF THEM. COUNTY

01:18:04.546 --> 01:18:06.214
HEALTH DEPARTMENT, COUNTY HEALTH

01:18:06.281 --> 01:18:08.016
DEPARTMENT. YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY.

01:18:08.083 --> 01:18:09.518
AND THEY COME THROUGH AND

01:18:09.584 --> 01:18:10.585
INSPECT US EVERY, EVERY SIX

01:18:10.652 --> 01:18:13.088
MONTHS, EVERY THING AND HAVE

01:18:13.155 --> 01:18:14.856
NEVER HAD. WE JUST HAD A DTSC

01:18:14.923 --> 01:18:16.458
INSPECTION A WEEK AND A HALF

01:18:16.525 --> 01:18:18.560
AGO. AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS 155

01:18:18.627 --> 01:18:20.395
GALLON DRUM OF USED MOTOR OIL.

01:18:20.462 --> 01:18:21.997
THAT WAS FIVE DAYS PAST DUE

01:18:22.064 --> 01:18:23.832
HAVING IT PUMPED OFF SITE. OTHER

01:18:23.899 --> 01:18:25.000
THAN THAT, THERE WAS NOTHING

01:18:25.067 --> 01:18:27.035
ELSE WRONG. SO YOU DO HAVE DTSC

01:18:27.102 --> 01:18:28.203
INSPECTIONS. OH OH DTSC

01:18:28.270 --> 01:18:30.405
REGULATES US. ABSOLUTELY,

01:18:30.472 --> 01:18:31.406
ABSOLUTELY. THEY ALREADY

01:18:31.473 --> 01:18:34.709
REGULATED FOR THE CERTIFIED

01:18:34.776 --> 01:18:36.645
APPLIANCE PROGRAM. THEY COME IN

01:18:36.711 --> 01:18:40.148
AND DO INSPECTIONS FOR ON US,

01:18:40.215 --> 01:18:42.084
BELIEVE ME. ABSOLUTELY. HAVE YOU

01:18:42.150 --> 01:18:43.452
EVER APPLIED FOR ANY PERMITS

01:18:43.518 --> 01:18:46.254
WITH THE DTSC? NO. OH I'M SORRY.

01:18:46.321 --> 01:18:48.023
NO. AS A CERTIFIED APPLIANCE

01:18:48.090 --> 01:18:50.759
RECYCLER, YOU HAVE TO APPLY

01:18:50.826 --> 01:18:51.993
THROUGH DTSC AS A CERTIFIED

01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:54.596
APPLIANCE RECYCLER, I BELIEVE WE

01:18:54.663 --> 01:18:57.032
HAVE TO GO THROUGH DTSC. I'D

01:18:57.099 --> 01:18:58.767
LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION OF THE

01:18:58.834 --> 01:19:01.703
ATTORNEY. HOW MANY PAGES OF

01:19:01.770 --> 01:19:04.606
DOCUMENTS WOULD YOU, IF YOU HAD

01:19:04.673 --> 01:19:06.808
TO APPLY FOR A PERMIT UNDER THIS

01:19:06.875 --> 01:19:10.345
NEW RULE? WOULD WOULD SOME SOME

01:19:10.412 --> 01:19:11.780
CONSULTANT OR SOME EMPLOYEE HAVE

01:19:11.847 --> 01:19:14.616
TO GO THROUGH TO UNDERSTAND THE

01:19:14.683 --> 01:19:18.620
DTSC PERMIT PROCESS? RIGHT. THE

01:19:18.687 --> 01:19:19.955
CONCEPT BEHIND THIS BILL IS THAT

01:19:20.021 --> 01:19:23.358
EACH FACILITY WOULD BE PREPARING

01:19:23.425 --> 01:19:26.161
A COMPENDIUM OF PLANS THAT ARE

01:19:26.228 --> 01:19:27.963
SPECIFIC TO THEIR OWN

01:19:28.029 --> 01:19:29.464
OPERATIONS, TAKING INTO

01:19:29.531 --> 01:19:30.465
CONSIDERATION THE TYPES OF

01:19:30.532 --> 01:19:32.100
MATERIALS THEY PROCESS, THE SIZE

01:19:32.167 --> 01:19:35.170
OF THE FACILITY, ETC, ETC. THE

01:19:35.237 --> 01:19:38.039
FACILITY CAN DO 90% OF THE WORK

01:19:38.106 --> 01:19:39.508
ON THOSE PLANS. MAYBE THEY NEED

01:19:39.574 --> 01:19:41.309
A CONSULTANT, MAYBE THEY DON'T.

01:19:41.376 --> 01:19:44.479
BUT THAT COMPENDIUM OF PLANS ARE

01:19:44.546 --> 01:19:46.047
REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY THE

01:19:46.114 --> 01:19:47.415
DEPARTMENT AND ESSENTIALLY

01:19:47.482 --> 01:19:49.284
BECOME THE PERMIT THAT WOULD BE

01:19:49.351 --> 01:19:51.052
ISSUED. MY QUESTION IS, I'M

01:19:51.119 --> 01:19:53.722
GOING TO THE COST OF THE WHAT?

01:19:53.788 --> 01:19:55.457
THE CONSULTANT OR THE EMPLOYEE.

01:19:55.524 --> 01:19:56.925
OR WOULD YOU HAVE TO HAVE

01:19:56.992 --> 01:19:58.660
SOMEONE, A FULL TIME EMPLOYEE,

01:19:58.727 --> 01:20:00.795
MONITOR THIS AFTER YOU APPLY THE

01:20:00.862 --> 01:20:01.830
PERMIT TO MEET PERMIT

01:20:01.897 --> 01:20:03.298
CONDITIONS. ET CETERA. ET

01:20:03.365 --> 01:20:04.399
CETERA. THERE IS A LEVEL OF

01:20:04.466 --> 01:20:06.234
EFFORT THAT WOULD CERTAINLY BE

01:20:06.301 --> 01:20:10.172
REQUIRED BY IN-HOUSE STAFF TO

01:20:10.238 --> 01:20:11.907
MONITOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE

01:20:11.973 --> 01:20:13.341
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE

01:20:13.408 --> 01:20:14.743
PERMIT, BUT I THINK MOST OF

01:20:14.809 --> 01:20:17.279
THESE FACILITIES HAVE EXISTING

01:20:17.345 --> 01:20:18.380
ENVIRONMENTAL STAFF, AND THAT

01:20:18.446 --> 01:20:20.081
FUNCTION COULD BE FULFILLED BY

01:20:20.148 --> 01:20:23.018
THOSE EXISTING EMPLOYEES.

01:20:23.084 --> 01:20:24.519
SENATOR, I'D LIKE TO MAKE A

01:20:24.586 --> 01:20:29.558
COMMENT THAT I HAVE BEEN THE

01:20:29.624 --> 01:20:32.394
RECIPIENT OF DTSC PERMITS AND

01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:34.162
AIR QUALITY PERMITS OVER THE

01:20:34.229 --> 01:20:37.432
YEARS, AND ALBEIT I'M NOT I'M

01:20:37.499 --> 01:20:40.669
NOT ANTI-REGULATION, I'M ANTI

01:20:40.735 --> 01:20:42.270
OVERREGULATION AND I FEEL THIS

01:20:42.337 --> 01:20:45.440
GOES A LITTLE BIT TOO FAR FOR

01:20:45.507 --> 01:20:47.309
THE SMALL GUYS THAT DON'T HAVE

01:20:47.375 --> 01:20:49.277
THE CAPACITY, THE ABILITY. I

01:20:49.344 --> 01:20:50.212
APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

01:20:50.278 --> 01:20:54.816
DO HERE, BUT I THINK THAT. IF I

01:20:54.883 --> 01:20:57.219
LOOK AT WHAT IT TAKES TO BE IN

01:20:57.285 --> 01:20:59.321
COMPLIANCE TO A SPECIFIC, THESE

01:20:59.387 --> 01:21:01.289
GUYS PROBABLY ARE SMALLER.

01:21:01.356 --> 01:21:02.624
RECYCLERS ARE DOING A GREAT JOB.

01:21:02.691 --> 01:21:04.893
YOU YOURSELF, YOU KNOW, WE

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:06.294
APPRECIATE THEIR WORK AND THE

01:21:06.361 --> 01:21:07.128
LARGE RUDDERS. THEY'RE ALL DOING

01:21:07.195 --> 01:21:10.832
A GREAT JOB. I JUST FIND IT HARD

01:21:10.899 --> 01:21:11.967
TO BELIEVE THAT SOMEONE IN A

01:21:12.033 --> 01:21:13.935
SMALL SCALE SHOULD HAVE TO

01:21:14.002 --> 01:21:15.870
OPERATE IN A LARGE SCALE,

01:21:15.937 --> 01:21:17.505
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE LARGER SCALE

01:21:17.572 --> 01:21:20.375
THEY'RE DOING HAZARDOUS WASTE

01:21:20.442 --> 01:21:21.176
TREATMENT, WHICH THEREFORE THEY

01:21:21.243 --> 01:21:23.144
SHOULD BE REGULATED BY THE DTSC.

01:21:23.211 --> 01:21:25.013
AND THIS FITS REALLY WELL THERE.

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:27.315
AND I ALSO FEEL LIKE FOR, YOU

01:21:27.382 --> 01:21:28.550
KNOW, WE HAVE THERMAL OXIDIZERS

01:21:28.617 --> 01:21:30.151
THAT ARE BURNING OFF ALL THE

01:21:30.218 --> 01:21:32.020
ORGANIC COMPOUNDS. I THINK THAT

01:21:32.087 --> 01:21:33.989
SHOWS A SIGN THAT THERE'S A

01:21:34.055 --> 01:21:34.522
HAZARDOUS CONSTITUENT AND

01:21:34.589 --> 01:21:35.724
THEREFORE THEY SHOULD BE

01:21:35.790 --> 01:21:37.626
REGULATED. I'M REALLY CONCERNED

01:21:37.692 --> 01:21:40.829
ABOUT THE SMALL GUYS. SO I'M

01:21:40.895 --> 01:21:42.197
GOING TO VOTE NO TODAY, JUST

01:21:42.264 --> 01:21:44.466
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THE SMALL

01:21:44.532 --> 01:21:44.933
GUY SHOULD BE EXEMPT.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.301
UNDERSTOOD. THANK YOU, SENATOR,

01:21:46.368 --> 01:21:51.239
VERY MUCH. OTHER QUESTIONS.

01:21:51.306 --> 01:21:52.474
SEEING NONE, I WANT TO THANK

01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:54.142
YOU, SENATOR, FOR BRINGING THIS

01:21:54.209 --> 01:21:56.711
BILL FORWARD. OBVIOUSLY, IT'S A

01:21:56.778 --> 01:21:58.813
CRUCIAL AREA. I'LL INVITE YOU TO

01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:00.415
CLOSE, MAYBE AND YOU TOUCHED ON

01:22:00.482 --> 01:22:02.817
THIS A LITTLE BIT EARLIER, BUT

01:22:02.884 --> 01:22:05.654
JUST THAT SMALL OPERATOR AND

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:07.522
KIND OF WHERE YOU SEE THAT

01:22:07.589 --> 01:22:09.991
FALLING OR AT LEAST SIGNALING

01:22:10.058 --> 01:22:11.226
KIND OF THE NATURE OF THE

01:22:11.293 --> 01:22:13.561
ONGOING DISCUSSIONS IN THAT

01:22:13.628 --> 01:22:15.130
REGARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR.

01:22:15.196 --> 01:22:17.565
CHAIR. AND I DO APPRECIATE THE

01:22:17.632 --> 01:22:18.333
ASSEMBLYMEMBERS COMMENTS AS

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:21.469
WELL. I YOU KNOW, PART OF IT IS

01:22:21.536 --> 01:22:23.138
THAT WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO

01:22:23.204 --> 01:22:28.777
THREAD A NEEDLE. DTSC HAS THE

01:22:28.843 --> 01:22:31.279
AUTHORITY UNDER CERTAIN RULES TO

01:22:31.346 --> 01:22:34.916
LOOK AT, FOR EXAMPLE, THE

01:22:34.983 --> 01:22:38.086
CERTIFIED APPLIANCE RECYCLER.

01:22:38.153 --> 01:22:40.655
RIGHT. BUT BUT THEY DON'T HAVE

01:22:40.722 --> 01:22:44.559
THE AUTHORITY TO, TO, TO

01:22:44.626 --> 01:22:47.529
REGULATE THE ENTIRE FACILITY.

01:22:47.595 --> 01:22:52.500
THEY HAVE TAKEN ACTION TO DO SO.

01:22:52.567 --> 01:22:54.169
AND THEN IT'S RESULTED IN

01:22:54.235 --> 01:22:55.370
LITIGATION BECAUSE THEY DON'T

01:22:55.437 --> 01:22:57.072
HAVE AUTHORITY FROM THE

01:22:57.138 --> 01:22:58.340
LEGISLATURE TO DO IT. THIS IS

01:22:58.406 --> 01:23:03.345
WHY WE'RE TRYING TO SET UP A

01:23:03.411 --> 01:23:04.813
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FRAMEWORK

01:23:04.879 --> 01:23:06.781
THAT WORKS. WE'RE STILL WORKING

01:23:06.848 --> 01:23:09.718
WITH THE SMALL SHREDDERS. THE

01:23:09.784 --> 01:23:11.786
CHALLENGE IS, IS THAT WE'RE ALSO

01:23:11.853 --> 01:23:13.388
WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION

01:23:13.455 --> 01:23:16.257
AND WITH DTSC, AND DTSC WANTS

01:23:16.324 --> 01:23:18.727
SOME REGULATORY, REGULATORY

01:23:18.793 --> 01:23:20.195
OVERSIGHT OF THE SMALL RECYCLERS

01:23:20.261 --> 01:23:23.398
AS WELL. AND SO IT'S A IT'S A

01:23:23.465 --> 01:23:24.265
IT'S A DELICATE BALANCE. WE'LL,

01:23:24.332 --> 01:23:26.935
WE'LL CONTINUE TO FIGURE OUT IF

01:23:27.001 --> 01:23:29.237
THERE'S A DIFFERENT PERMIT THAT

01:23:29.304 --> 01:23:33.108
THEY CAN GET. IN THE END. AFTER

01:23:33.174 --> 01:23:35.009
DOING ALL OF THIS WORK, I WANT

01:23:35.076 --> 01:23:37.011
TO MAKE SURE THAT IF, IF WE CAN

01:23:37.078 --> 01:23:38.380
GET IT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK,

01:23:38.446 --> 01:23:39.981
THAT HE'LL SIGN IT. AND SO

01:23:40.048 --> 01:23:41.716
HAVING DTSC THINK IT'S A

01:23:41.783 --> 01:23:42.350
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT THEY

01:23:42.417 --> 01:23:43.918
CAN WORK WITH THAT MAKES SENSE.

01:23:43.985 --> 01:23:47.155
AND THAT THAT PAYING THE FEES IN

01:23:47.222 --> 01:23:48.990
WILL GIVE THEM THE ABILITY TO

01:23:49.057 --> 01:23:50.725
REGULATE THEM BOTH AT A

01:23:50.792 --> 01:23:52.227
DIFFERENT LEVEL. THAT'S REALLY

01:23:52.293 --> 01:23:55.096
WHAT WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS. AND

01:23:55.163 --> 01:24:00.301
SO YOU HAVE MY, MY. ASSURANCE

01:24:00.368 --> 01:24:02.003
THAT WE'LL CONTINUE TO HAVE

01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:03.238
CONVERSATIONS. I'M JUST WE'VE

01:24:03.304 --> 01:24:04.806
HAD THEM OVER THE PAST NUMBER OF

01:24:04.873 --> 01:24:06.107
MONTHS. I'M NOT SURE WE'RE GOING

01:24:06.174 --> 01:24:08.209
TO BE ABLE TO GET THERE. WHAT

01:24:08.276 --> 01:24:10.178
THEY WANT IS TO BE EXEMPTED FROM

01:24:10.245 --> 01:24:12.313
ANY REGULATION. AND THAT BECOMES

01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:15.750
DIFFICULT BECAUSE EVERY SMALL,

01:24:15.817 --> 01:24:17.385
EVERY SHREDDER DOES THEIR

01:24:17.452 --> 01:24:18.453
PROCESSING A LITTLE BIT

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:20.021
DIFFERENTLY. AND THAT'S ONE OF

01:24:20.088 --> 01:24:23.425
THE REASONS WHY EVERY SHREDDING

01:24:23.491 --> 01:24:27.128
FACILITY WILL HAVE THE ABILITY

01:24:27.195 --> 01:24:28.963
TO MAKE THEIR BEST CASE TO DTSC

01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:30.064
ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING, HOW

01:24:30.131 --> 01:24:31.499
THEY'RE DOING IT, AND THE AND

01:24:31.566 --> 01:24:35.003
THE ASSURANCES THAT ARE PART OF

01:24:35.069 --> 01:24:38.973
THE BILL ARE BEING MET. AND SO

01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:41.843
WE SEE THIS AS MORE OF A, OF A,

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:44.712
OF A PROCESS THAT WILL COME. AND

01:24:44.779 --> 01:24:47.248
LET ME JUST SAY THAT IT INCLUDES

01:24:47.315 --> 01:24:49.384
PUBLIC COMMENT AS PART OF THE

01:24:49.451 --> 01:24:51.786
PERMIT, THE PUBLIC CAN CHALLENGE

01:24:51.853 --> 01:24:55.089
THE PERMIT WITH DTSC AS WELL.

01:24:55.156 --> 01:25:01.029
THE THEIR. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

01:25:01.095 --> 01:25:03.097
THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED

01:25:03.164 --> 01:25:04.966
AS PART OF THE BILL, AS PART OF

01:25:05.033 --> 01:25:06.935
THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS, BECAUSE

01:25:07.001 --> 01:25:09.571
WE WANT IF THERE HAVE BEEN BAD

01:25:09.637 --> 01:25:13.241
ACTORS IN THE PAST, WE CAN'T

01:25:13.308 --> 01:25:14.642
CHANGE WHAT HAPPENED IN THE

01:25:14.709 --> 01:25:16.444
PAST. AND SO WHAT WE WANT TO

01:25:16.511 --> 01:25:19.414
MAKE SURE IS THAT THOSE THINGS,

01:25:19.481 --> 01:25:21.382
FIRES, FLOATING MATERIALS

01:25:21.449 --> 01:25:23.718
OUTSIDE OF THE FACILITY DO NOT

01:25:23.785 --> 01:25:25.520
HAPPEN, WHICH IS WHY WE HAVEN'T

01:25:25.587 --> 01:25:26.955
CHANGED ANY OF THE AUTHORITIES

01:25:27.021 --> 01:25:30.091
OF THE OTHER ENTITIES, THE AIR

01:25:30.158 --> 01:25:31.960
BOARD, THE WATER BOARD, THE

01:25:32.026 --> 01:25:34.062
COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT, THE

01:25:34.128 --> 01:25:36.397
THROUGH ALL OF THAT REMAINS AS

01:25:36.464 --> 01:25:39.267
PART OF THE PROCESS BECAUSE WE

01:25:39.334 --> 01:25:41.336
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE

01:25:41.402 --> 01:25:43.104
FACILITIES THAT HAVE BEEN

01:25:43.171 --> 01:25:45.039
LOCATED WAY TOO CLOSE TO

01:25:45.106 --> 01:25:47.408
RESIDENTIAL IN THE PAST, BAD

01:25:47.475 --> 01:25:49.177
LAND USE DECISIONS, QUITE

01:25:49.244 --> 01:25:52.413
FRANKLY, DON'T DON'T CREATE A

01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:53.648
NUISANCE FOR THE COMMUNITY AND

01:25:53.715 --> 01:25:54.649
THAT WE'RE WE'RE DOING

01:25:54.716 --> 01:25:57.452
EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO CLEAN UP

01:25:57.519 --> 01:25:59.087
ANY, ANY CHALLENGES THAT THERE

01:25:59.153 --> 01:26:01.155
MIGHT BE. SO WITH THAT, I WOULD

01:26:01.222 --> 01:26:02.423
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE

01:26:02.490 --> 01:26:03.258
UNLESS THERE ARE ANY OTHER

01:26:03.324 --> 01:26:04.459
QUESTIONS, MR. CHAIR. YEAH, NO.

01:26:04.526 --> 01:26:06.127
AND REALLY JUST UPLIFTING A

01:26:06.194 --> 01:26:08.229
COUPLE THINGS YOU SAID, AND I

01:26:08.296 --> 01:26:10.064
APPRECIATE YOU TAKING SOME KEY

01:26:10.131 --> 01:26:13.334
AMENDMENTS TO DATE. ONE IS THE

01:26:13.401 --> 01:26:15.069
FACT THAT THE PUBLIC WILL BE

01:26:15.136 --> 01:26:17.639
ABLE TO APPEAL THESE PERMITS

01:26:17.705 --> 01:26:22.610
THROUGH DTSC. ANOTHER IS THAT

01:26:22.677 --> 01:26:25.280
PUBLIC ATTORNEYS WILL BE ABLE TO

01:26:25.346 --> 01:26:26.748
ENFORCE THE PROVISIONS OF THIS

01:26:26.814 --> 01:26:29.183
BILL. THAT HAVING BEEN SAID, AS

01:26:29.250 --> 01:26:30.685
YOU NOTED, THERE ARE SOME

01:26:30.752 --> 01:26:34.222
ONGOING CONVERSATIONS. LET US

01:26:34.289 --> 01:26:35.957
KNOW OF ANY POTENTIAL CHANGES IF

01:26:36.024 --> 01:26:38.860
WE CAN BE OF HELP IN

01:26:38.927 --> 01:26:40.728
FACILITATING STAKEHOLDER

01:26:40.795 --> 01:26:43.631
DISCUSSIONS. COUNT US IN. THIS

01:26:43.698 --> 01:26:46.000
DOES RECOMMEND AN AYE VOTE FROM

01:26:46.067 --> 01:26:48.937
THE CHAIR TODAY. WITH THAT, DO I

01:26:49.003 --> 01:26:52.140
HAVE A MOTION? AND SECOND ON SB

01:26:52.206 --> 01:26:56.945
404 AND I WILL SECOND, IF WE CAN

01:26:57.011 --> 01:27:00.415
HAVE A ROLL. THIS IS FILE ITEM

01:27:00.481 --> 01:27:03.685
NUMBER ONE SB 404 BY SENATOR

APPRECIATE YOU.

01:28:05.179 --> 01:28:24.632
TAKE A SECOND. THIS IS.

01:31:44.632 --> 01:31:47.101
OKAY. WE'RE MOVING ON TO ITEM

01:31:47.168 --> 01:31:50.238
TWO, SENATE BILL 601. WE HAVE

01:31:50.304 --> 01:31:52.840
SENATOR ALLEN. THIS IS A BILL

01:31:52.907 --> 01:31:55.042
DEALING WITH WATER QUALITY.

01:31:55.109 --> 01:31:56.811
WELCOME. WELL, THANK YOU SO

01:31:56.878 --> 01:31:59.614
MUCH, MISTER CHAIR. SO THIS BILL

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:04.752
WOULD BUILDS OUT OF A VERY

01:32:04.819 --> 01:32:06.087
CONTROVERSIAL SUPREME COURT

01:32:06.153 --> 01:32:10.157
DECISION BACK IN 2023. SACKETT V

01:32:10.224 --> 01:32:12.693
EPA, WHERE THE SUPREME COURT

01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:16.030
NARROWLY. YOU KNOW,

01:32:16.097 --> 01:32:16.964
SIGNIFICANTLY NARROWED THE

01:32:17.031 --> 01:32:18.833
DEFINITION OF WOTUS THE WATERS

01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:20.568
OF THE UNITED STATES, THE

01:32:20.635 --> 01:32:22.036
PROTECTIONS WATERS THAT WOULD BE

01:32:22.103 --> 01:32:23.137
PROTECTED UNDER THE CLEAN WATER

01:32:23.204 --> 01:32:24.672
ACT, WATERS THAT HAD BEEN

01:32:24.739 --> 01:32:26.007
PROTECTED FOR MANY, MANY YEARS

01:32:26.073 --> 01:32:27.241
UNDER THE CLEAN WATER ACT. AND

01:32:27.308 --> 01:32:28.843
HE BASICALLY, THE COURT SAID

01:32:28.910 --> 01:32:30.845
THAT THAT WE'RE NO LONGER GOING

01:32:30.912 --> 01:32:32.213
TO APPLY THOSE CLEAN WATER ACT

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:34.682
PROTECTIONS TO THOSE WETLAND

01:32:34.749 --> 01:32:35.683
STREAMS AND RIVERS THAT MAY

01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:37.351
OCCASIONALLY DRY UP. HERE IN

01:32:37.418 --> 01:32:39.387
CALIFORNIA, WE KNOW THAT SO MANY

01:32:39.453 --> 01:32:41.389
OF OUR WATERWAYS OCCASIONALLY

01:32:41.455 --> 01:32:43.224
DRY UP. THAT'S A VERY KIND OF

01:32:43.291 --> 01:32:46.360
EAST COAST DECISION. VERY FEW

01:32:46.427 --> 01:32:48.062
RIVERS ARE EVER DRY IN THE EAST

01:32:48.129 --> 01:32:49.764
COAST. BUT HERE MANY, MANY OF

01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:51.399
OURS ARE DRY UP AT CERTAIN TIMES

01:32:51.465 --> 01:32:54.802
OF THE YEAR. AND SO WHAT THAT

01:32:54.869 --> 01:32:56.304
DID EFFECTIVELY WAS STRIP MANY

01:32:56.370 --> 01:32:58.739
OF THESE WATERS THAT HAD ENJOYED

01:32:58.806 --> 01:33:00.141
THESE WATERWAYS, THAT HAD

01:33:00.207 --> 01:33:01.309
ENJOYED CLEAN WATER ACT

01:33:01.375 --> 01:33:02.743
PROTECTIONS FOR MANY YEARS OF

01:33:02.810 --> 01:33:03.978
THEIR LONG STANDING FEDERAL

01:33:04.045 --> 01:33:05.947
PROTECTIONS, WHILE CREATING MORE

01:33:06.013 --> 01:33:06.514
UNCERTAINTY REGARDING WHICH

01:33:06.580 --> 01:33:08.916
WATERS REMAIN PROTECTED. NOW,

01:33:08.983 --> 01:33:11.986
THE STATE WATER BOARD HAS NOTED

01:33:12.053 --> 01:33:13.187
THAT THIS DECISION IS MOST

01:33:13.254 --> 01:33:15.189
LIKELY TO IMPACT. WATERS WITHIN

01:33:15.256 --> 01:33:16.390
THE CENTRAL VALLEY, WHICH

01:33:16.457 --> 01:33:17.692
INCLUDE LARGE NUMBERS OF

01:33:17.758 --> 01:33:18.960
ISOLATED VERNAL POOL WETLANDS,

01:33:19.026 --> 01:33:19.994
AND IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,

01:33:20.061 --> 01:33:21.495
WHICH HAS A PREVALENCE OF

01:33:21.562 --> 01:33:22.463
EPHEMERAL OR DISCONNECTED

01:33:22.530 --> 01:33:24.999
WATERS. NOW, WE DO HAVE OUR

01:33:25.066 --> 01:33:27.168
STATE LAW, PORTER-COLOGNE, WHICH

01:33:27.234 --> 01:33:29.036
IS VERY IMPORTANT. OF COURSE, IT

01:33:29.103 --> 01:33:30.771
CONTINUES TO REGULATE THESE

01:33:30.838 --> 01:33:32.840
WATERS, BUT IT LACKS SOME OF THE

01:33:32.907 --> 01:33:35.076
MORE STRINGENT PROTECTIONS THAT

01:33:35.142 --> 01:33:38.579
WERE UNDER THE CLEAN WATER ACT,

01:33:38.646 --> 01:33:42.283
SUCH AS TOTAL MAXIMUM DAILY LOAD

01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:43.617
REQUIREMENTS, IMPAIRED WATER

01:33:43.684 --> 01:33:44.285
LISTINGS, AS WELL AS THE

01:33:44.352 --> 01:33:45.553
STRONGER PROTECTIONS FOR

01:33:45.619 --> 01:33:46.921
ENVIRONMENTAL AND HUMAN HEALTH

01:33:46.988 --> 01:33:48.756
IN ESTABLISHING WATER QUALITY

01:33:48.823 --> 01:33:51.859
OBJECTIVES. IN ADDITION, THE

01:33:51.926 --> 01:33:53.794
ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS, THE

01:33:53.861 --> 01:33:55.963
TOOLS UNDER PORTER-COLOGNE ARE

01:33:56.030 --> 01:33:57.264
NOT AS STRONG AS UNDER THE CLEAN

01:33:57.331 --> 01:33:59.166
WATER ACT, WHICH HAS HIGH

01:33:59.233 --> 01:34:00.301
PENALTIES THAT ACT AS STRONG

01:34:00.368 --> 01:34:01.402
DETERRENTS. IT ALSO CLEAN WATER

01:34:01.469 --> 01:34:04.538
ACT INCLUDED INFLATIONARY

01:34:04.605 --> 01:34:06.741
ADJUSTMENTS AND OPPORTUNITIES

01:34:06.807 --> 01:34:08.175
FOR CITIZEN ENFORCEMENT OF

01:34:08.242 --> 01:34:08.943
VIOLATIONS IN ORDER TO

01:34:09.010 --> 01:34:10.811
SUPPLEMENT AGENCY EFFORTS TO

01:34:10.878 --> 01:34:14.081
HOLD POLLUTERS ACCOUNTABLE, AND

01:34:14.148 --> 01:34:16.350
AS A RESULT OF THAT, OF COURSE,

01:34:16.417 --> 01:34:17.118
THAT MEANS THAT POLLUTER

01:34:17.184 --> 01:34:18.019
ACCOUNTABILITY UNDER THE CLEAN

01:34:18.085 --> 01:34:20.054
WATER ACT IS NOT DEPENDENT ON

01:34:20.121 --> 01:34:21.355
AGENCY, STAFFING AND RESOURCES

01:34:21.422 --> 01:34:25.026
AT THE WATER BOARD. NOW, WHAT

01:34:25.092 --> 01:34:27.294
WE'VE SEEN AT THE WATER BOARD,

01:34:27.361 --> 01:34:29.030
PARTLY AS A RESULT OF THE FACT

01:34:29.096 --> 01:34:30.831
THAT THEY'RE UP TO THEIR EARS IN

01:34:30.898 --> 01:34:31.966
RESPONSIBILITY AND DON'T HAVE

01:34:32.033 --> 01:34:34.802
ENOUGH RESOURCES, LITERALLY NO

01:34:34.869 --> 01:34:36.370
ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, EVEN

01:34:36.437 --> 01:34:37.705
COMPLIANT ACTIONS, COMPLIANCE

01:34:37.772 --> 01:34:39.273
ACTIONS OR INFORMAL ENFORCEMENT

01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:40.908
ACTIONS WERE TAKEN EVERY YEAR

01:34:40.975 --> 01:34:44.345
SINCE 2017. IN OVER 70% OF KNOWN

01:34:44.412 --> 01:34:46.881
WASTE DISCHARGE PERMIT

01:34:46.947 --> 01:34:49.917
VIOLATIONS. NOW, IT IS TRUE THAT

01:34:49.984 --> 01:34:51.252
LAST YEAR WE DID ALLOCATE MORE

01:34:51.318 --> 01:34:53.120
RESOURCES TO THE WATER BOARD FOR

01:34:53.187 --> 01:34:55.389
INCREASED STAFFING AND PARTLY AS

01:34:55.456 --> 01:34:57.525
A RESULT OF THAT DATA AND THE

01:34:57.591 --> 01:34:58.893
SECOND DECISION, WE ASKED THEM

01:34:58.959 --> 01:35:00.561
ALSO TO REPORT BACK ON IMPACTS

01:35:00.628 --> 01:35:02.263
ON THEIR WORKLOAD. BUT THIS

01:35:02.329 --> 01:35:04.065
REPORT IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE

01:35:04.131 --> 01:35:04.932
THE UNDERLYING FUNDAMENTAL

01:35:04.999 --> 01:35:06.033
PROBLEM THAT THE POLLUTION

01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:07.234
PREVENTION STANDARDS AND TOOLS

01:35:07.301 --> 01:35:08.903
AND ENFORCEMENT UNDER THE CLEAN

01:35:08.969 --> 01:35:10.471
WATER ACT ARE STRONGER THAN

01:35:10.538 --> 01:35:12.640
THOSE UNDER PORTER-COLOGNE. AND,

01:35:12.706 --> 01:35:14.275
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE INDICATIONS

01:35:14.341 --> 01:35:15.342
THAT THERE MAY BE FURTHER

01:35:15.409 --> 01:35:17.311
CHANGES TO THE DEFINITION OF

01:35:17.378 --> 01:35:19.046
WOTUS ON CREATING ADDITIONAL

01:35:19.113 --> 01:35:20.047
UNCERTAINTY. SO THIS IS

01:35:20.114 --> 01:35:21.248
ULTIMATELY ABOUT ENSURING THAT

01:35:21.315 --> 01:35:24.051
WE NOT BACKSLIDE. AND IT

01:35:24.118 --> 01:35:25.219
BASICALLY SEEKS TO APPLY

01:35:25.286 --> 01:35:27.388
PROTECTIONS FOR POINT SOURCE

01:35:27.455 --> 01:35:29.156
DISCHARGES, SUCH AS FROM A PIPE

01:35:29.223 --> 01:35:30.558
OR A SPECIFIC DRAINAGE DITCH,

01:35:30.624 --> 01:35:33.227
INTO NEXUS WATERS, ANALOGOUS TO

01:35:33.294 --> 01:35:34.495
THOSE FOR FEDERALLY PROTECTED

01:35:34.562 --> 01:35:35.563
WATERS THROUGH INTEGRATION OF

01:35:35.629 --> 01:35:36.430
NEXUS WATERS INTO THE CLEAN

01:35:36.497 --> 01:35:39.133
WATER ACT. IMPLEMENTING STATUTE

01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:41.969
IN OUR STATE STATUTE. SO THE WAY

01:35:42.036 --> 01:35:44.238
WE HAVE IT FRAMED, THE NEXUS

01:35:44.305 --> 01:35:46.373
WATERS CATEGORY IS DESIGNED TO

01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:48.175
CAPTURE SURFACE WATERS THAT ARE

01:35:48.242 --> 01:35:49.977
NOT CURRENTLY FEDERALLY

01:35:50.044 --> 01:35:51.445
REGULATED, THAT WERE NOT

01:35:51.512 --> 01:35:53.881
EXCLUDED FROM A PRE BIDEN ERA

01:35:53.948 --> 01:35:55.382
WOTUS RULE AND WERE NOT ALREADY

01:35:55.449 --> 01:35:58.953
DEEMED TO BE NOT A WOTUS PRE

01:35:59.019 --> 01:36:01.822
SACKETT, THUS MOSTLY CAPTURING

01:36:01.889 --> 01:36:03.457
WATERS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN

01:36:03.524 --> 01:36:04.692
FEDERALLY PROTECTED PRIOR TO

01:36:04.758 --> 01:36:09.029
SACKETT. WE ARE YOU KNOW YOU

01:36:09.096 --> 01:36:11.332
KNOW, WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH

01:36:11.398 --> 01:36:13.667
THIS COMMITTEE AND I THINK AT

01:36:13.734 --> 01:36:14.802
THE NEXT COMMITTEE GOES TO

01:36:14.869 --> 01:36:15.903
PROPOSE. BUT WE'VE BEEN WORKING

01:36:15.970 --> 01:36:17.171
ON WE'VE GOT SOME AMENDMENTS

01:36:17.238 --> 01:36:19.073
THAT ARE IN HERE TO NARROW DOWN

01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:21.675
THE DEFINITION OF THE WATERS, TO

01:36:21.742 --> 01:36:24.178
BETTER COMPLY WITH THE CAVANAUGH

01:36:24.245 --> 01:36:27.381
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH'S CONCURRENCE

01:36:27.448 --> 01:36:28.883
IN THE SACKETT DECISION THAT

01:36:28.949 --> 01:36:30.284
THAT WAS SIGNED ON TO BY THE

01:36:30.351 --> 01:36:32.686
MORE LIBERAL JUSTICES, BY THE

01:36:32.753 --> 01:36:35.389
WAY, TO CALLING FOR A MORE A

01:36:35.456 --> 01:36:36.757
MORE BASICALLY CRITICIZING HOW

01:36:36.824 --> 01:36:38.993
ROBUST THE OR THE EARLIER CLEAN

01:36:39.059 --> 01:36:41.695
WATER ACT DEFINITION HAD BEEN.

01:36:41.762 --> 01:36:43.364
WE'RE ALSO TAKING OUT WE'VE

01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:45.065
TAKEN OUT THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF

01:36:45.132 --> 01:36:47.201
ACTION. IT'S BEEN REPLACED BY

01:36:47.268 --> 01:36:52.506
PUBLIC PROSECUTORS. SO. BUT,

01:36:52.573 --> 01:36:57.378
BUT. WE SPECIFY THAT THAT THOSE

01:36:57.444 --> 01:36:59.146
PUBLIC PROSECUTORS WOULD NOT BE

01:36:59.213 --> 01:37:00.014
ALLOWED TO BRING AN ACTION IN

01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:01.448
THOSE CASES WHERE THE APPLICABLE

01:37:01.515 --> 01:37:02.983
REGIONAL WATER BOARD OR THE

01:37:03.050 --> 01:37:04.418
STATE BOARD OR THE ATTORNEY

01:37:04.485 --> 01:37:06.020
GENERAL ARE ALREADY DILIGENTLY

01:37:06.086 --> 01:37:08.489
PROSECUTING A VIOLATION. SO WE

01:37:08.556 --> 01:37:10.991
ARE WE ARE CONTINUE TO BE REALLY

01:37:11.058 --> 01:37:12.126
INTERESTED IN TRYING TO NARROW

01:37:12.193 --> 01:37:13.827
THE DEFINITION OF NEXUS WATERS

01:37:13.894 --> 01:37:14.995
OVER THE COURSE OF LEGISLATIVE

01:37:15.062 --> 01:37:16.263
PROCESS TO PROVIDE MORE CLARITY

01:37:16.330 --> 01:37:18.899
AND LIMIT THE BILL. YOU KNOW, WE

01:37:18.966 --> 01:37:20.634
CERTAINLY HAVE TAKEN EXTENSIVE

01:37:20.701 --> 01:37:22.469
AMENDMENTS SINCE THE BILL WAS

01:37:22.536 --> 01:37:23.904
INTRODUCED, AND WE'VE BEEN

01:37:23.971 --> 01:37:25.306
TRYING OUR BEST TO LISTEN TO ALL

01:37:25.372 --> 01:37:26.607
THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS

01:37:26.674 --> 01:37:27.174
REGARDING FEASIBLE

01:37:27.241 --> 01:37:29.009
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BILL AND

01:37:29.076 --> 01:37:29.577
ADDRESS CERTAIN OVERREACHES

01:37:29.643 --> 01:37:30.844
BEYOND THE SACKETT FRAMEWORK,

01:37:30.911 --> 01:37:32.880
AND ADDRESS CONCERNS THAT THE

01:37:32.947 --> 01:37:34.014
ORIGINAL CITIZEN ENFORCEMENT

01:37:34.081 --> 01:37:35.149
PROVISIONS IN THE BILL WOULD

01:37:35.216 --> 01:37:36.617
LEAD TO BAD ACTOR ABUSES. AND

01:37:36.684 --> 01:37:39.086
THAT'S WHY WE DID AWAY WITH THE

01:37:39.153 --> 01:37:42.723
PRA. SO WHERE WE ARE NOW,

01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:44.525
THOUGH, I BELIEVE IT'S STILL A

01:37:44.592 --> 01:37:45.526
STRONG BILL, WE'RE CONFIDENT IT

01:37:45.593 --> 01:37:46.994
CAN BE EFFICIENTLY IMPLEMENTED.

01:37:47.061 --> 01:37:48.128
I BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT TO PASS

01:37:48.195 --> 01:37:49.863
NOW RATHER THAN WAITING UNTIL

01:37:49.930 --> 01:37:51.699
POLLUTION GETS WORSE TO TAKE

01:37:51.765 --> 01:37:53.500
ACTION. AND WITH ME HERE TODAY,

01:37:53.567 --> 01:37:54.368
WE HAVE SEAN BOTHWELL FROM

01:37:54.435 --> 01:37:55.502
CALIFORNIA COAST KEEPER ALLIANCE

01:37:55.569 --> 01:37:57.371
AND ALSO KIM DELFINO ON BEHALF

01:37:57.438 --> 01:37:59.974
OF DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE.

01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:01.342
WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON. CHAIR,

01:38:01.408 --> 01:38:03.110
COMMITTEE MEMBERS SEAN BOTHWELL

01:38:03.177 --> 01:38:04.245
FOR CALIFORNIA COAST KEEPER

01:38:04.311 --> 01:38:06.780
ALLIANCE. THE SUPREME COURT'S

01:38:06.847 --> 01:38:08.148
DECISION DRASTICALLY REDUCED

01:38:08.215 --> 01:38:10.050
CLEAN WATER ACT PROTECTIONS FOR

01:38:10.117 --> 01:38:11.585
CALIFORNIA'S WATERWAYS. THE

01:38:11.652 --> 01:38:12.920
SECOND DECISION ESSENTIALLY

01:38:12.987 --> 01:38:14.822
OVERTURNED THE BIDEN RULE FOR

01:38:14.888 --> 01:38:16.490
WHAT IS A WATER OF THE UNITED

01:38:16.557 --> 01:38:17.224
STATES AND THEREFORE WHAT THE

01:38:17.291 --> 01:38:18.692
CLEAN WATER ACT COVERS, AND

01:38:18.759 --> 01:38:20.427
INSTEAD HAS RETURNED US TO TRUMP

01:38:20.494 --> 01:38:22.563
LEVEL PROTECTIONS, MEANING ONLY

01:38:22.630 --> 01:38:24.398
MAJOR WATERWAYS THAT FLOW ALL

01:38:24.465 --> 01:38:25.799
YEAR LONG ARE NOW PROTECTED

01:38:25.866 --> 01:38:27.635
UNDER THE CLEAN WATER ACT. AND

01:38:27.701 --> 01:38:29.203
WATERWAYS THAT ARE SEASONAL,

01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:30.971
MANY OF WHICH ARE IN CALIFORNIA,

01:38:31.038 --> 01:38:32.006
ARE NO LONGER PROTECTED UNDER

01:38:32.072 --> 01:38:34.174
THE CLEAN WATER ACT. STATEWIDE,

01:38:34.241 --> 01:38:36.343
WE ANTICIPATE THERE'S ABOUT SIX

01:38:36.410 --> 01:38:38.078
600,000 MILES OF STREAMS THAT

01:38:38.145 --> 01:38:39.213
ARE LOSING PROTECTIONS, AND

01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:42.182
ANYWHERE FROM 50 TO 97% OF OUR

01:38:42.249 --> 01:38:43.884
WETLANDS ARE LOSING PROTECTIONS.

01:38:43.951 --> 01:38:47.087
IN THE BAY AREA, 61% OF ALL

01:38:47.154 --> 01:38:48.289
STREAMS ARE EPHEMERAL, MEANING

01:38:48.355 --> 01:38:50.124
THAT THEY'RE SEASONAL AND ARE NO

01:38:50.190 --> 01:38:50.924
LONGER PROTECTED. UNDER THE

01:38:50.991 --> 01:38:53.160
CLEAN WATER ACT, 71% OF STREAMS

01:38:53.227 --> 01:38:55.095
IN LOS ANGELES ARE LOSING CLEAN

01:38:55.162 --> 01:38:57.831
WATER ACT PROTECTIONS. SB 601

01:38:57.898 --> 01:38:59.700
SIMPLY PUTS CALIFORNIA BACK TO

01:38:59.767 --> 01:39:00.901
PROTECTING THE WATERWAYS THAT

01:39:00.968 --> 01:39:02.069
HAVE ALWAYS BEEN PROTECTED UNDER

01:39:02.136 --> 01:39:04.905
A DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP. THE

01:39:04.972 --> 01:39:06.307
SECOND DECISION WAS SO EXTREME

01:39:06.373 --> 01:39:07.908
THAT WE'RE NOT EVEN THE ONLY

01:39:07.975 --> 01:39:09.610
STATE THAT IS TAKING ACTION.

01:39:09.677 --> 01:39:12.046
SIMILAR TO SB 601, THERE'S SEVEN

01:39:12.112 --> 01:39:13.747
OTHER STATES THAT HAVE AT LEAST

01:39:13.814 --> 01:39:16.250
INTRODUCED LEGISLATION SIMILAR

01:39:16.317 --> 01:39:19.520
TO SB 601, SEVERAL OF WHICH HAVE

01:39:19.586 --> 01:39:20.921
BEEN ENACTED AND QUITE FRANKLY,

01:39:20.988 --> 01:39:23.123
HAVE STRONGER PROVISIONS THAN

01:39:23.190 --> 01:39:25.959
THE BILL BEFORE YOU HERE TODAY.

01:39:26.026 --> 01:39:27.361
PORTER-COLOGNE IS AN IMPORTANT

01:39:27.428 --> 01:39:29.730
BACKSTOP, BUT IT IS INSUFFICIENT

01:39:29.797 --> 01:39:30.364
TO PROTECT OUR WATERWAYS THE WAY

01:39:30.431 --> 01:39:32.533
THE CLEAN WATER ACT DOES,

01:39:32.599 --> 01:39:34.268
PORTER-COLOGNE ALLOWS DOES NOT

01:39:34.335 --> 01:39:35.536
PROVIDE THE MONITORING NECESSARY

01:39:35.602 --> 01:39:37.237
TO KNOW IF YOU'RE IN COMPLIANCE

01:39:37.304 --> 01:39:39.273
OR NOT. IT ALLOWS FOR ANONYMOUS

01:39:39.340 --> 01:39:40.407
REPORTING SO THAT YOU DON'T KNOW

01:39:40.474 --> 01:39:41.875
WHO'S IN VIOLATION AND WHO'S

01:39:41.942 --> 01:39:43.677
NOT. AND IT ALLOWS FOR

01:39:43.744 --> 01:39:45.012
AGGREGATION OF TOWNSHIP DATA. SO

01:39:45.079 --> 01:39:46.780
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE THE

01:39:46.847 --> 01:39:47.715
POLLUTION IS COMING FROM TO

01:39:47.781 --> 01:39:49.483
ADDRESS. WITHOUT SB 601, WE LOSE

01:39:49.550 --> 01:39:51.518
A LOT OF WORK IN CALIFORNIA. ALL

01:39:51.585 --> 01:39:53.087
OF OUR CLEAN WATER ACT PERMITS

01:39:53.153 --> 01:39:54.822
WILL NEED TO BE TURNED INTO

01:39:54.888 --> 01:39:56.357
STATE PERMITS, ALL OF WHICH

01:39:56.423 --> 01:39:57.691
REQUIRE CEQA AND WILL HAVE

01:39:57.758 --> 01:39:59.460
LESSER PROTECTIONS. AND THE

01:39:59.526 --> 01:40:01.362
SENATOR MENTIONED TOTAL DAILY

01:40:01.428 --> 01:40:02.429
MAXIMUM LOADS, WHICH IS A

01:40:02.496 --> 01:40:04.031
FEDERAL CLEAN WATER ACT TOOL.

01:40:04.098 --> 01:40:05.599
THOSE ARE USED FOR OUR MOST

01:40:05.666 --> 01:40:06.266
POLLUTED WATERWAYS, THE

01:40:06.333 --> 01:40:08.402
WATERWAYS THAT ARE TOO POLLUTED

01:40:08.469 --> 01:40:11.472
TO SWIM, FISH, DRINK AND WITHOUT

01:40:11.538 --> 01:40:15.042
SB 601, THOSE REQUIREMENTS FOR

01:40:15.109 --> 01:40:17.511
THOSE WATERWAYS GO AWAY. WE LOSE

01:40:17.578 --> 01:40:19.246
THOSE PROTECTIONS AND THOSE

01:40:19.313 --> 01:40:20.381
STANDARDS. SO FOR THOSE REASONS,

01:40:20.447 --> 01:40:24.218
I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. GOOD

01:40:24.284 --> 01:40:25.753
AFTERNOON. KIM DELFINO,

01:40:25.819 --> 01:40:26.720
TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF

01:40:26.787 --> 01:40:28.989
DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE. AS WE'VE

01:40:29.056 --> 01:40:30.457
ALREADY HEARD, SB 601 IS ALL

01:40:30.524 --> 01:40:32.226
ABOUT DEALING WITH THE AFTERMATH

01:40:32.292 --> 01:40:34.027
OF SACKETT AS CONCURRING.

01:40:34.094 --> 01:40:35.396
CONCURRING. JUSTICE KAGAN

01:40:35.462 --> 01:40:36.830
COMMENTED AT THE TIME, THE

01:40:36.897 --> 01:40:38.065
MAJORITY OPINION COULD USE EVERY

01:40:38.132 --> 01:40:40.267
LETTER OF THE ALPHABET AND

01:40:40.334 --> 01:40:41.802
GRADUATE TO QUADRATIC EQUATIONS

01:40:41.869 --> 01:40:42.970
AND STILL NOT SOLVE ITS

01:40:43.036 --> 01:40:44.405
ESSENTIAL PROBLEM. IN OTHER

01:40:44.471 --> 01:40:45.939
WORDS, SACKETT DECISION

01:40:46.006 --> 01:40:47.307
COMPLETELY IGNORED THE IMPORTANT

01:40:47.374 --> 01:40:49.376
ROLE OF SCIENCE IN POLICY AND

01:40:49.443 --> 01:40:50.210
CONSEQUENTLY HAS LEFT

01:40:50.277 --> 01:40:51.645
CALIFORNIA'S WETLANDS, STREAMS,

01:40:51.712 --> 01:40:53.180
AND OTHER WATERS EXPOSED TO

01:40:53.247 --> 01:40:54.381
GREATER THREATS AND WORSENING

01:40:54.448 --> 01:40:56.316
WATER QUALITY AND FLOW. WE'VE

01:40:56.383 --> 01:40:57.284
ALREADY HEARD CALIFORNIA'S

01:40:57.351 --> 01:40:58.852
HYDROLOGY IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM

01:40:58.919 --> 01:41:00.654
THE FROM THE EAST AND THE

01:41:00.721 --> 01:41:01.955
MIDWEST. WE HAVE WE'RE BASICALLY

01:41:02.022 --> 01:41:04.391
AN ARID STATE FOR THE MOST PART,

01:41:04.458 --> 01:41:05.759
AND WATERS APPEAR AND THEN

01:41:05.826 --> 01:41:06.393
DISAPPEAR DEPENDING ON WHETHER

01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:08.562
WE'RE IN DROUGHT OR WHETHER IT'S

01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:10.431
SUMMER OR IT'S FALL. AND THESE

01:41:10.497 --> 01:41:11.832
WATERS SERVE AS ESSENTIAL

01:41:11.899 --> 01:41:13.333
HABITAT FOR WILDLIFE, SAFE

01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:14.601
DRINKING WATER FOR COMMUNITIES,

01:41:14.668 --> 01:41:16.236
AND NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS FOR

01:41:16.303 --> 01:41:17.604
CLIMATE RESILIENCE. AND WHILE

01:41:17.671 --> 01:41:20.140
THIS MAY SEEM OBVIOUS, IT BEARS

01:41:20.207 --> 01:41:22.142
REPEATING OUR WATERS ARE

01:41:22.209 --> 01:41:23.977
CONNECTED WHEN THERE IS A SOURCE

01:41:24.044 --> 01:41:26.146
OF POLLUTION, SUCH AS RUNOFF

01:41:26.213 --> 01:41:27.014
FROM A DREDGE AND FILL PROJECT

01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:28.148
OF A WETLAND OR URBAN TOXICS

01:41:28.215 --> 01:41:29.416
RUNNING INTO NEARBY STORM

01:41:29.483 --> 01:41:31.552
DRAINS, THE IMPACTS CAN BE

01:41:31.618 --> 01:41:34.054
WIDESPREAD. THE SACKETT DECISION

01:41:34.121 --> 01:41:35.856
LIMITED OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN

01:41:35.923 --> 01:41:37.357
FEDERAL PROTECTIONS FOR OUR

01:41:37.424 --> 01:41:38.859
WATERS BECAUSE IT PULLED BACK

01:41:38.926 --> 01:41:40.260
CLEAN WATER ACT PROTECTIONS FROM

01:41:40.327 --> 01:41:42.029
WHAT WE'RE CALLING NEXUS WATERS.

01:41:42.095 --> 01:41:43.831
THESE ARE WATERS, AS NOTED BY

01:41:43.897 --> 01:41:45.265
THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS, THAT

01:41:45.332 --> 01:41:46.667
HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED WATERS OF

01:41:46.733 --> 01:41:48.535
THE US BY EIGHT DIFFERENT

01:41:48.602 --> 01:41:50.370
PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATIONS.

01:41:50.437 --> 01:41:52.840
FOR THE MOST PART, SB 601 SIMPLY

01:41:52.906 --> 01:41:54.708
MAINTAINS THE STATUS QUO FOR

01:41:54.775 --> 01:41:56.543
NEXUS WATERS. IT KEEPS THE

01:41:56.610 --> 01:41:57.644
STANDARDS IN TERMS OF THE

01:41:57.711 --> 01:41:59.279
FEDERAL CLEAN WATER ACT PERMITS

01:41:59.346 --> 01:42:01.181
IN PLACE. I SAY, FOR THE MOST

01:42:01.248 --> 01:42:02.483
PART, BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY BEEN

01:42:02.549 --> 01:42:04.351
POINTED OUT THAT SB 601 WAS

01:42:04.418 --> 01:42:05.619
AMENDED TO REMOVE THE CITIZEN

01:42:05.686 --> 01:42:06.854
SUIT PROVISION. SO WE ACTUALLY

01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:09.156
ARE NOT GOING BACK TO WHERE WE

01:42:09.223 --> 01:42:10.224
WERE BEFORE THE SACKETT

01:42:10.290 --> 01:42:11.859
DECISION. AND IN FACT, AS ALSO

01:42:11.925 --> 01:42:13.093
BEEN NOTED, THE BILL HAS BEEN

01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:14.995
AMENDED ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS TO

01:42:15.062 --> 01:42:17.364
MAKE IT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT SB

01:42:17.431 --> 01:42:19.433
601 IS NOT COLORING OUTSIDE OF

01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:21.335
THE FEDERAL CLEAN WATER ACT

01:42:21.401 --> 01:42:24.171
LINES. SO BY ENACTING SB 601,

01:42:24.238 --> 01:42:25.205
CALIFORNIA WILL BE JOINING

01:42:25.272 --> 01:42:27.040
SEVERAL STATES IN AN EFFORT TO

01:42:27.107 --> 01:42:29.409
FILL THE GAP LEFT BY THE SECOND

01:42:29.476 --> 01:42:30.944
DECISION. AND FOR THESE REASONS,

01:42:31.011 --> 01:42:32.746
WE URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU.

01:44:42.843 --> 01:44:44.911
CERTAINLY WANT TO THANK NAOMI

01:44:44.978 --> 01:44:47.681
FOR HER ENGAGEMENT, FACILITATING

01:44:47.748 --> 01:44:48.815
A NUMBER OF MEETINGS BETWEEN

01:44:48.882 --> 01:44:50.617
BOTH SIDES. I THINK IT'S BEEN A

01:44:50.684 --> 01:44:53.086
VERY HELPFUL AND CONSTRUCTIVE TO

01:44:53.153 --> 01:44:55.622
THE CONVERSATION. SO, YOU KNOW,

01:44:55.689 --> 01:44:56.823
LIKE I SAID, THE AUTHOR HAS

01:44:56.890 --> 01:44:58.291
TAKEN A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS TO

01:44:58.358 --> 01:45:00.060
ADDRESS CONCERNS WITH SOME OF

01:45:00.127 --> 01:45:01.395
THE WATER QUALITY RELATED

01:45:01.461 --> 01:45:02.929
CONCERNS WE'VE HAD WITH THE

01:45:02.996 --> 01:45:06.133
BILL. HOWEVER, THERE ARE STILL A

01:45:06.199 --> 01:45:08.468
FEW WATER QUALITY RELATED ISSUES

01:45:08.535 --> 01:45:10.804
THAT WE ARE HOPING TO RESOLVE,

01:45:10.871 --> 01:45:12.305
AND CERTAINLY ONE OF THEM

01:45:12.372 --> 01:45:14.408
INVOLVES THE DEFINITION OF NEXUS

01:45:14.474 --> 01:45:16.309
WATERS. SO, YOU KNOW, LIKE YOU

01:45:16.376 --> 01:45:17.678
HEARD, THE INTENT OF THE

01:45:17.744 --> 01:45:19.579
DEFINITION IS TO CAPTURE WATER

01:45:19.646 --> 01:45:21.682
BODIES THAT WERE CONSIDERED

01:45:21.748 --> 01:45:22.749
WOTUS PRIOR TO THIS ACT

01:45:22.816 --> 01:45:24.151
DECISION, BUT LOST THAT

01:45:24.217 --> 01:45:26.620
PROTECTION FOLLOWING THE SACKETT

01:45:26.687 --> 01:45:28.455
DECISION. HOWEVER,

01:45:28.522 --> 01:45:30.724
FUNDAMENTALLY, THE DEFINITION

01:45:30.791 --> 01:45:32.459
PRESENTS CONCERNS BECAUSE IT

01:45:32.526 --> 01:45:34.227
DEFINES ALL WATERS OF THE STATE

01:45:34.294 --> 01:45:37.831
AS NEXUS WATERS, UNLESS

01:45:37.898 --> 01:45:41.702
SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDED, AND SO

01:45:41.768 --> 01:45:43.303
ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES WITH

01:45:43.370 --> 01:45:45.372
THAT IS THEORIZING ALL THE

01:45:45.439 --> 01:45:48.008
POTENTIAL WATER BODIES THAT WERE

01:45:48.075 --> 01:45:50.477
WOTUS BUT ARE NO LONGER WOTUS.

01:45:50.544 --> 01:45:52.946
AND THIS THIS DEFINITION OF

01:45:53.013 --> 01:45:56.583
WOTUS HAS CHANGED AND EVOLVED

01:45:56.650 --> 01:45:59.753
FOR DECADES. WHAT YOU KNOW,

01:45:59.820 --> 01:46:01.154
BEFORE SACKETT AND AFTER

01:46:01.221 --> 01:46:03.790
SACKETT, WHAT IS A WOTUS IS NOT

01:46:03.857 --> 01:46:05.959
ALWAYS EVIDENT. AND

01:46:06.026 --> 01:46:06.727
ADDITIONALLY, KIND OF

01:46:06.793 --> 01:46:08.495
COMPOUNDING THESE ISSUES IS THAT

01:46:08.562 --> 01:46:10.030
DEFINING NEXUS WATERS IN STATUTE

01:46:10.097 --> 01:46:11.231
ARE SPECIFICALLY THOSE

01:46:11.298 --> 01:46:12.466
EXCLUSIONS IN STATUTE MEANS THAT

01:46:12.532 --> 01:46:13.500
IF YOU INADVERTENTLY LEAVE

01:46:13.567 --> 01:46:14.868
SOMETHING OUT, YOU'RE GOING TO

01:46:14.935 --> 01:46:16.369
HAVE TO RUN ANOTHER BILL ALL

01:46:16.436 --> 01:46:19.339
OVER AGAIN IN ORDER TO INCLUDE

01:46:19.406 --> 01:46:22.209
THAT EXCLUSION. AND SO IN ONE OF

01:46:22.275 --> 01:46:24.644
THE MAIN CONCERNS AS WELL, IS

01:46:24.711 --> 01:46:27.481
HOW THIS DEFINITION WOULD APPLY

01:46:27.547 --> 01:46:29.349
TO ARTIFICIAL WATER SUPPLY

01:46:29.416 --> 01:46:31.151
INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THIS IS

01:46:31.218 --> 01:46:33.220
SOMETHING THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME

01:46:33.286 --> 01:46:35.422
ROBUST CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

01:46:35.489 --> 01:46:37.991
LATELY. YOU KNOW, ONE POSSIBLE

01:46:38.058 --> 01:46:40.560
WAY TO ADDRESS THIS IS

01:46:40.627 --> 01:46:41.528
POTENTIALLY DIRECTING THE STATE

01:46:41.595 --> 01:46:43.296
WATER BOARD TO DEVELOP THE

01:46:43.363 --> 01:46:45.866
DEFINITION OF NEXUS WATERS. THE

01:46:45.932 --> 01:46:47.300
REGULATORY PROCESS IS A LITTLE

01:46:47.367 --> 01:46:49.503
MORE FLUID. IT ALLOWS A STATE

01:46:49.569 --> 01:46:51.371
AGENCY TO EXERCISE ITS SUBJECT

01:46:51.438 --> 01:46:53.140
MATTER EXPERTISE, ROBUST

01:46:53.206 --> 01:46:56.443
STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT. SO, YOU

01:46:56.510 --> 01:46:58.411
KNOW, THAT'S THAT'S ONE POSSIBLE

01:46:58.478 --> 01:47:01.014
APPROACH. AND AS THE AUTHOR IS

01:47:01.081 --> 01:47:02.115
AWARE, WE DO HAVE A NUMBER OF

01:47:02.182 --> 01:47:03.183
CONCERNS WITH THE ENFORCEMENT,

01:47:03.250 --> 01:47:04.017
SOME OF THE ENFORCEMENT RELATED

01:47:04.084 --> 01:47:06.119
PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL. SO, YOU

01:47:06.186 --> 01:47:08.755
KNOW, WE'RE HERE IN FINAL POLICY

01:47:08.822 --> 01:47:09.723
COMMITTEE. THERE'S A LOT OF WORK

01:47:09.790 --> 01:47:12.559
LEFT TO DO. YOU KNOW, POSSIBLY

01:47:12.626 --> 01:47:14.327
MAKING THIS A TWO YEAR BILL AND

01:47:14.394 --> 01:47:17.230
ALLOWING ADDITIONAL TIME TO WORK

01:47:17.297 --> 01:47:19.065
THROUGH SOME OF THESE VERY

01:47:19.132 --> 01:47:21.201
COMPLEX ISSUES WOULD BE HELPFUL.

01:47:21.268 --> 01:47:22.903
IT WOULD ALSO ALLOW THE BILL TO

01:47:22.969 --> 01:47:24.304
BE INFORMED BY THE REPORT THAT'S

01:47:24.371 --> 01:47:25.939
COMING FROM THE STATE WATER

01:47:26.006 --> 01:47:26.973
BOARD NEXT YEAR, SO THAT THERE

01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:29.509
WOULD BE SOME INFORMATION AS TO

01:47:29.576 --> 01:47:30.977
WHETHER WHAT SORT OF ISSUES THE

01:47:31.044 --> 01:47:32.312
WATER BOARD HAS IDENTIFIED AND

01:47:32.379 --> 01:47:33.713
WHETHER THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY

01:47:33.780 --> 01:47:36.983
RESPONSIVE TO THOSE ISSUES. SO

01:47:37.050 --> 01:47:40.220
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. GOOD

01:47:40.287 --> 01:47:41.254
AFTERNOON, NOEL KRAMERS WITH

01:47:41.321 --> 01:47:44.558
WINE INSTITUTE. I TOO, WANT TO

01:47:44.624 --> 01:47:46.059
EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO THE

01:47:46.126 --> 01:47:47.227
AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF FOR WORKING

01:47:47.294 --> 01:47:49.029
WITH US ON AMENDMENTS AND TO THE

01:47:49.095 --> 01:47:50.397
COMMITTEE CONSULTANT FOR

01:47:50.463 --> 01:47:51.298
ENGAGING AND BRINGING US

01:47:51.364 --> 01:47:52.833
TOGETHER TO HAVE THESE

01:47:52.899 --> 01:47:54.601
CONVERSATIONS. THIS IS A VERY

01:47:54.668 --> 01:47:57.103
COMPLEX AREA OF LAW. I KNOW THE

01:47:57.170 --> 01:47:57.971
SPONSORS TOOK QUITE A BIT OF

01:47:58.038 --> 01:48:00.440
TIME TO COME UP WITH WHAT THEY

01:48:00.507 --> 01:48:01.575
WERE PROPOSING. AS A DEFINITION

01:48:01.641 --> 01:48:03.944
FOR NEXUS WATERS, WE THINK THAT

01:48:04.010 --> 01:48:07.614
MORE TIME IS NEEDED FOR EVERYONE

01:48:07.681 --> 01:48:10.083
TO COME UP WITH A CLEAR

01:48:10.150 --> 01:48:11.284
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THAT

01:48:11.351 --> 01:48:13.320
DEFINITION IS. I WANT TO POINT

01:48:13.386 --> 01:48:16.556
OUT THAT WE HAVE A ROBUST WATER

01:48:16.623 --> 01:48:18.325
QUALITY PROTECTION LAW IN

01:48:18.391 --> 01:48:19.826
PORTER-COLOGNE IN CALIFORNIA,

01:48:19.893 --> 01:48:22.062
AND WHEN THE SACKETT DECISION

01:48:22.128 --> 01:48:24.531
WAS ANNOUNCED, WE HAD THE

01:48:24.598 --> 01:48:26.433
GOVERNOR, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

01:48:26.499 --> 01:48:27.868
AND THE STATE WATER BOARD ALL

01:48:27.934 --> 01:48:30.637
COME OUT AND TALK ABOUT THEIR

01:48:30.704 --> 01:48:32.138
FRUSTRATION WITH THE SACKETT

01:48:32.205 --> 01:48:34.207
DECISION, BUT THAT IT WOULD NOT

01:48:34.274 --> 01:48:35.642
HAVE SIGNIFICANT EFFECT IN

01:48:35.709 --> 01:48:37.177
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF OUR

01:48:37.244 --> 01:48:38.578
EXISTING WATER QUALITY

01:48:38.645 --> 01:48:40.313
PROTECTIONS. SO I THINK THAT

01:48:40.380 --> 01:48:42.949
ARGUES FOR THE NEED TO TAKE TIME

01:48:43.016 --> 01:48:46.586
TO GET THIS RIGHT, RATHER THAN

01:48:46.653 --> 01:48:47.520
SPEEDING THIS THROUGH AND

01:48:47.587 --> 01:48:49.122
POTENTIALLY HAVING TO COME BACK

01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:50.757
AFTER WE SEE THE REPORT NEXT

01:48:50.824 --> 01:48:52.359
YEAR, THERE'S A COUPLE OF

01:48:52.425 --> 01:48:53.627
PROVISIONS THAT WE REALLY DO

01:48:53.693 --> 01:48:56.563
HAVE EXISTING AND CONTINUING

01:48:56.630 --> 01:48:59.099
CONCERNS WITH. ONE IS THE

01:48:59.165 --> 01:49:00.333
ELIMINATION OF THE REQUIREMENT

01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:03.003
THAT THE STATE BOARD CONSIDER

01:49:03.069 --> 01:49:04.137
ECONOMIC IMPACTS IN THEIR

01:49:04.204 --> 01:49:07.374
PERMITTING DECISIONS SO THAT

01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:08.808
WHEN IF A PERMIT COVERED BOTH

01:49:08.875 --> 01:49:11.511
FEDERAL AND STATE PROVISIONS,

01:49:11.578 --> 01:49:13.146
THEY WOULD THE STATE BOARD AND

01:49:13.213 --> 01:49:13.980
REGIONAL BOARD WOULD NO LONGER

01:49:14.047 --> 01:49:16.349
HAVE TO CONSIDER ECONOMIC

01:49:16.416 --> 01:49:17.450
IMPACTS WHEN THEY'RE MAKING

01:49:17.517 --> 01:49:18.451
THOSE STATE LEVEL DECISIONS. AND

01:49:18.518 --> 01:49:20.053
WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:21.354
ULTIMATE IMPACT ON BUSINESSES

01:49:21.421 --> 01:49:23.490
WITH THAT. THE OTHER PIECE IS,

01:49:23.556 --> 01:49:25.091
IS, AS MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED,

01:49:25.158 --> 01:49:27.827
THE NEXUS WATERS DEFINITION, THE

01:49:27.894 --> 01:49:30.096
WAY IT'S DEFINED RIGHT NOW WITH

01:49:30.163 --> 01:49:31.898
THE RECENT AMENDMENTS,

01:49:31.965 --> 01:49:33.967
AGRICULTURAL DRAINAGE DITCHES

01:49:34.034 --> 01:49:37.037
THAT ULTIMATELY COULD HAVE SOME

01:49:37.103 --> 01:49:39.005
CONNECTION DOWNSTREAM TO NEXUS

01:49:39.072 --> 01:49:42.742
WATERS OR NAVIGABLE WATERS WOULD

01:49:42.809 --> 01:49:43.677
BE INCLUDED IN THE DEFINITION.

01:49:43.743 --> 01:49:45.512
SO THEN THOSE AG DRAINAGE

01:49:45.578 --> 01:49:47.314
STRUCTURES GET WRAPPED INTO THIS

01:49:47.380 --> 01:49:48.348
PERMITTING REQUIREMENT. AND WE

01:49:48.415 --> 01:49:50.283
THINK THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE

01:49:50.350 --> 01:49:52.319
MORE TIME TO WORK THAT OUT SO

01:49:52.385 --> 01:49:53.453
THAT WE DON'T HAVE UNINTENDED

01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:55.622
CONSEQUENCES ON AGRICULTURE. I

01:49:55.689 --> 01:49:58.124
JUST WANT TO, AS WAS POINTED OUT

01:49:58.191 --> 01:50:00.593
IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS, THE

01:50:00.660 --> 01:50:01.361
DEFINITION OF WATERS OF THE

01:50:01.428 --> 01:50:03.530
UNITED STATES HAS BEEN LITIGATED

01:50:03.596 --> 01:50:06.032
FOR THE PAST 50 YEARS. AND THE

01:50:06.099 --> 01:50:08.535
LACK OF CLARITY AROUND THAT

01:50:08.601 --> 01:50:11.371
DEFINITION HAS LED TO THE NEED

01:50:11.438 --> 01:50:13.273
TO HIRE A LOT OF CONSULTANTS TO

01:50:13.340 --> 01:50:16.176
FIGURE THIS OUT. IF WE ADOPTED

01:50:16.242 --> 01:50:18.945
SB 601 AS IN PRINT TODAY, THAT

01:50:19.012 --> 01:50:21.147
WOULD ONLY EXACERBATE THE

01:50:21.214 --> 01:50:23.984
CHALLENGE WITH NEEDING TO HIRE

01:50:24.050 --> 01:50:26.519
CADRE OF CONSULTANTS, WHICH ADDS

01:50:26.586 --> 01:50:29.522
COSTS AND TIME TO PERMITS. AND

01:50:29.589 --> 01:50:32.359
WE SO WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE

01:50:32.425 --> 01:50:33.193
SURE WE GET THIS RIGHT FOR

01:50:33.259 --> 01:50:34.828
BUSINESSES AND WOULD ASK FOR

01:50:34.894 --> 01:50:36.296
MORE TIME TO HAVE THESE

01:50:36.363 --> 01:50:39.232
NEGOTIATIONS. THANK YOU. THANK

01:50:39.299 --> 01:50:40.934

01:54:51.618 --> 01:54:53.152
ALL WATERS OF THE STATE ARE

01:54:53.219 --> 01:54:54.821

01:54:56.222 --> 01:54:59.125
HAVE THAT RIGHT UNDER THIS BILL?

01:54:59.192 --> 01:55:00.927
IS THAT WHAT YOU TESTIFIED TO?

01:55:00.994 --> 01:55:03.663
IT'S ALL WATERS OF THE STATE,

01:55:03.730 --> 01:55:07.033
EXCEPT. AND THEN THERE'S A LIST

01:55:07.100 --> 01:55:09.802
OF ENUMERATED EXEMPTIONS. OKAY.

01:55:09.869 --> 01:55:12.071
WE HAVE THAT RIGHT. AND THOSE

01:55:12.138 --> 01:55:13.573
EXCEPTIONS ARE CURRENTLY

01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:15.808
REGULATED IN OTHER WAYS BY THE

01:55:15.875 --> 01:55:20.313
STATE. RIGHT. NOT IN EVERY CASE.

01:55:20.380 --> 01:55:23.516
NOT IN EVERY CASE. NO. OKAY. IS

01:55:23.583 --> 01:55:27.487
THAT YOUR ISSUE THEN? OH, I

01:55:27.553 --> 01:55:29.289
DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE

01:55:29.355 --> 01:55:31.491
REFERRING TO IN TERMS OF WHAT IS

01:55:31.557 --> 01:55:33.993
NOT REGULATED, WHERE THE CLEAN

01:55:34.060 --> 01:55:37.330
WATER ACT ENDS PORTER-COLOGNE

01:55:37.397 --> 01:55:39.766
BEGINS. AND SO ANY WATER BODY

01:55:39.832 --> 01:55:42.235
THAT MAY HAVE LOST PROTECTION

01:55:42.302 --> 01:55:44.971
UNDER THE CLEAN WATER ACT IS

01:55:45.038 --> 01:55:45.972
STILL REGULATED UNDER

01:55:46.039 --> 01:55:49.976
PORTER-COLOGNE. SO IN THE LIST

01:55:50.043 --> 01:55:51.644
OF EXCLUSIONS, THERE ARE SOME,

01:55:51.711 --> 01:55:53.880
LIKE PRIOR CONVERTED CROPLAND,

01:55:53.946 --> 01:55:55.581
IS ACTUALLY UNDER THE WETLANDS

01:55:55.648 --> 01:55:56.683
POLICY. UNDER PORTER-COLOGNE IS

01:55:56.749 --> 01:55:59.986
NOT REGULATED AT ALL. SO JUST TO

01:56:00.053 --> 01:56:02.889
BE CLEAR OKAY. AND IT WOULDN'T

01:56:02.955 --> 01:56:04.590
BE REGULATED UNDER THIS BILL

01:56:04.657 --> 01:56:07.593
EITHER. GOT IT. SO MAYBE AS PART

01:56:07.660 --> 01:56:09.996
OF THAT IT SEEMS LIKE ONE OF THE

01:56:10.063 --> 01:56:12.965
CRUCIAL ISSUES IS COMING DOWN TO

01:56:13.032 --> 01:56:15.335
NEXUS WATERS. AND WHAT WHAT THAT

01:56:15.401 --> 01:56:17.203
MEANS, HOW IT WOULD BE HANDLED

01:56:17.270 --> 01:56:19.238
IF, IF YOU COULD TACKLE THAT

01:56:19.305 --> 01:56:20.740
MORE DIRECTLY. AND IT SOUNDS

01:56:20.807 --> 01:56:22.875
LIKE THERE ARE ONGOING

01:56:22.942 --> 01:56:24.277
DISCUSSIONS AROUND THAT AS WELL.

01:56:24.344 --> 01:56:26.879
MAYBE TOUCH ON THAT. I WANT TO I

01:56:26.946 --> 01:56:28.514
WANT TO TALK TO THEM MORE. I

01:56:28.581 --> 01:56:29.649
MEAN, OBVIOUSLY WE'VE WE'VE BEEN

01:56:29.716 --> 01:56:33.252
WORKING TO TRY TO, TO FURTHER

01:56:33.319 --> 01:56:35.521
CONSTRAIN THE DEFINITION BECAUSE

01:56:35.588 --> 01:56:36.856
I THINK THERE WAS THERE WAS A

01:56:36.923 --> 01:56:40.193
GENERAL RECOGNITION THAT THE AT

01:56:40.259 --> 01:56:42.995
LEAST AMONGST THE JUSTICES THAT

01:56:43.062 --> 01:56:44.597
INCLUDING THE LIBERAL ONES, THAT

01:56:44.664 --> 01:56:45.965
THAT THAT SOME OF THE WATERS

01:56:46.032 --> 01:56:47.233
THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY REGULATED

01:56:47.300 --> 01:56:49.335
UNDER THE CLEAN WATER ACT, THAT

01:56:49.402 --> 01:56:51.337
IT THAT IT BASICALLY IT WENT TOO

01:56:51.404 --> 01:56:53.773
FAR THAT THE THAT THE THAT THE

01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:55.341
DEFINITION THAT WAS BEING

01:56:55.408 --> 01:56:56.142
APPLIED BY THE AGENCY WAS GOING

01:56:56.209 --> 01:56:59.912
TOO FAR. AND SO, SO WHAT SO I'M

01:56:59.979 --> 01:57:02.081
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO NOW IS

01:57:02.148 --> 01:57:04.617
TO KIND OF GET IT DOWN TO THE

01:57:04.684 --> 01:57:07.120
TYPES OF WATERS TO TRY OUR BEST

01:57:07.186 --> 01:57:09.489
TO, TO CONFORM WITH A COUPLE OF

01:57:09.555 --> 01:57:11.858
THE CONCURRENCES THAT WERE, THAT

01:57:11.924 --> 01:57:14.794
WERE RELATING TO THIS DECISION

01:57:14.861 --> 01:57:16.329
SO AS TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE,

01:57:16.396 --> 01:57:17.864
WE'RE, WE'RE PROVIDING VERY

01:57:17.930 --> 01:57:18.998
MEANINGFUL PROTECTIONS FOR THOSE

01:57:19.065 --> 01:57:20.767
WATERS THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT

01:57:20.833 --> 01:57:22.402
THAT THAT LOST THEIR PROTECTIONS

01:57:22.468 --> 01:57:25.571
UNDER SACKETT, BUT THAT DON'T

01:57:25.638 --> 01:57:27.573
THAT DON'T THEY DON'T STEP INTO

01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:31.277
THE KIND OF OVER THE TOP ONEROUS

01:57:31.344 --> 01:57:32.011
OVERREGULATION THAT I THINK IS

01:57:32.078 --> 01:57:34.113
AT THE HEART OF THE OPPOSITION'S

01:57:34.180 --> 01:57:36.983
CONCERNS. SO I THINK THAT'S

01:57:37.049 --> 01:57:38.351
WE'VE WE'VE DONE A LOT TO NARROW

01:57:38.418 --> 01:57:40.887
SO FAR, BUT I KNOW WE HAVE A

01:57:40.953 --> 01:57:42.088
LITTLE BIT MORE TO GO. AND I

01:57:42.155 --> 01:57:44.090
THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE A LOT

01:57:44.157 --> 01:57:46.526
OF THE TASK OF THIS WEEK AND A

01:57:46.592 --> 01:57:47.393
COUPLE OF WEEKS OVER THE SUMMER

01:57:47.460 --> 01:57:49.562
TO SEE WHETHER WE CAN'T LAND A

01:57:49.629 --> 01:57:50.997
GOOD LAND IN A GOOD PLACE IN

01:57:51.063 --> 01:57:53.633
TERMS OF, OF THE WATER

01:57:53.699 --> 01:57:56.068
DEFINITION, I KNOW THEY'VE GOT

01:57:56.135 --> 01:57:57.303
THEY'VE OBVIOUSLY HAVE A FEW

01:57:57.370 --> 01:57:58.971
OTHER CONCERNS, BUT I WOULD

01:57:59.038 --> 01:58:01.541
THAT'S PROBABLY YOUR BIGGEST ON

01:58:01.607 --> 01:58:04.010
THE ON THE WATER QUALITY SIDE.

01:58:04.076 --> 01:58:07.647
ABSOLUTELY. YEAH. YEAH. OKAY. AT

01:58:07.713 --> 01:58:09.715
THIS POINT, IF THERE ARE NO

01:58:09.782 --> 01:58:10.983
OTHER QUESTIONS I'LL INVITE YOU

01:58:11.050 --> 01:58:12.952
TO CLOSE. BUT I THINK YEAH,

01:58:13.019 --> 01:58:14.754
THAT'S REALLY UNDERSCORING THE

01:58:14.821 --> 01:58:19.792
DISCUSSION. SO IF I MAY, IT IS

01:58:19.859 --> 01:58:21.127
THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO CAPTURE

01:58:21.194 --> 01:58:24.864
AT LEAST WHAT WAS PROTECTED PRE

01:58:24.931 --> 01:58:26.132
SACKETT. TOTALLY. THAT'S EXACTLY

01:58:26.199 --> 01:58:28.634
RIGHT. AND THAT'S THE PRIMARY

01:58:28.701 --> 01:58:29.902
FOCUS OF THE BILL. SO AND IN

01:58:29.969 --> 01:58:31.070
FACT IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO I

01:58:31.137 --> 01:58:33.739
MEAN I THINK AS YOU'RE HEARING

01:58:33.806 --> 01:58:34.774
IT WILL NOT INCLUDE ALL THE

01:58:34.841 --> 01:58:35.708
PROTECTIONS THAT EXISTED PRE

01:58:35.775 --> 01:58:37.143
SACKETT. THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE

01:58:37.210 --> 01:58:38.411
A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.

01:58:38.478 --> 01:58:40.279
THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE THE

01:58:40.346 --> 01:58:41.714
DEFINITION OF THE WATERS THAT

01:58:41.781 --> 01:58:42.782
WERE INCLUDED WILL BE LIMITED,

01:58:42.849 --> 01:58:45.151
YOU KNOW, WILL BE SMALLER IN

01:58:45.218 --> 01:58:46.819
SCOPE THAN WHAT WAS BEING

01:58:46.886 --> 01:58:48.387
PROTECTED PRE SACKETT OKAY. ALL

01:58:48.454 --> 01:58:49.222
RIGHT. THE QUESTION IS WHERE DO

01:58:49.288 --> 01:58:53.726
WE LAND WITHIN THAT SMALLER

01:58:53.793 --> 01:58:54.627
UNIVERSE OF WHAT A NEXUS WATER

01:58:54.694 --> 01:58:57.763
MIGHT BE? YEAH. I WOULD INVITE

01:58:57.830 --> 01:59:01.534
YOU TO CLOSE AT THIS TIME. YEAH.

01:59:01.601 --> 01:59:03.369
I MEAN, LET ME ONE THING JUST TO

01:59:03.436 --> 01:59:05.671
REMEMBER IN ALL THIS IS THAT

01:59:05.738 --> 01:59:06.372
WITH OR WITHOUT THE BILL, THE

01:59:06.439 --> 01:59:08.374
REGULATED ENTITIES WILL STILL

01:59:08.441 --> 01:59:10.977
NEED TO OBTAIN A PERMIT BEFORE

01:59:11.043 --> 01:59:12.678
DISCHARGING INTO INTO NEXUS

01:59:12.745 --> 01:59:14.614
WATERS. BUT, BUT, BUT THIS BILL

01:59:14.680 --> 01:59:16.182
IS SEEKING TO INCORPORATE THE

01:59:16.249 --> 01:59:17.083
CATEGORY OF WATERS INTO THE

01:59:17.149 --> 01:59:19.619
STRONGER FEDERAL PERMITTING

01:59:19.685 --> 01:59:20.786
FRAMEWORK, WHICH, YOU KNOW,

01:59:20.853 --> 01:59:21.654
LARGELY WOULD HAVE APPLIED TO

01:59:21.721 --> 01:59:23.623
THEM HAD THE SUPREME COURT NOT

01:59:23.689 --> 01:59:24.790
CHANGED THE DEFINITION. YOU

01:59:24.857 --> 01:59:26.626
KNOW, AS WELL AS TRYING TO MAKE

01:59:26.692 --> 01:59:27.994
SOME IMPROVEMENTS TO SOME OF THE

01:59:28.060 --> 01:59:29.762
ENFORCEMENT TOOLS AT THE AT THE

01:59:29.829 --> 01:59:31.797
WATER BOARD. BUT THIS IS FROM MY

01:59:31.864 --> 01:59:32.965
PERSPECTIVE, ABOUT TRYING TO

01:59:33.032 --> 01:59:34.500
HELP THE WATER BOARDS MORE

01:59:34.567 --> 01:59:35.568
EFFICIENTLY REACT TO THE SACKETT

01:59:35.635 --> 01:59:36.369
DECISION, RATHER THAN SPENDING

01:59:36.435 --> 01:59:38.271
EFFORT AND RESOURCES ON

01:59:38.337 --> 01:59:39.805
RESTRUCTURING THEIR PROGRAMS

01:59:39.872 --> 01:59:40.940
FIRST, YOU KNOW, FOR EXAMPLE,

01:59:41.007 --> 01:59:42.375
SHOULD SHOULD THE BILL PASS, THE

01:59:42.441 --> 01:59:44.176
WATER BOARD SHOULD WOULD BE ABLE

01:59:44.243 --> 01:59:45.177
TO CONTINUE TO UTILIZE THE

01:59:45.244 --> 01:59:47.346
GENERAL INDUSTRIAL AND

01:59:47.413 --> 01:59:49.549
CONSTRUCTION STORMWATER PERMITS

01:59:49.615 --> 01:59:50.249
ALREADY DEVELOPED UNDER THE

01:59:50.316 --> 01:59:52.351
CLEAN WATER ACT FOR NEXUS

01:59:52.418 --> 01:59:53.319
WATERS, RATHER THAN HAVING TO

01:59:53.386 --> 01:59:55.288
START FROM SCRATCH, SO THEY'D BE

01:59:55.354 --> 01:59:57.023
ABLE TO CONTINUE THAT PRACTICE.

01:59:57.089 --> 01:59:59.225
SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF THIS

01:59:59.292 --> 02:00:00.159
COULD PROVIDE A LOT OF BENEFIT.

02:00:00.226 --> 02:00:01.994
I UNDERSTAND THERE'S STILL SOME

02:00:02.061 --> 02:00:03.162
STICKY ISSUES THAT WE'RE JUST

02:00:03.229 --> 02:00:04.964
GOING TO HAVE TO SEE IF WE CAN

02:00:05.031 --> 02:00:07.633
WORK OUT. BUT THERE'S A THERE'S

02:00:07.700 --> 02:00:08.901
A THERE'S A REAL THERE'S A,

02:00:08.968 --> 02:00:11.003
THERE'S A REAL BENEFIT TO OUR,

02:00:11.070 --> 02:00:12.805
TO OUR WATER PROTECTION SYSTEM.

02:00:12.872 --> 02:00:16.309
IF WE'RE ABLE TO PASS SOMETHING

02:00:16.375 --> 02:00:17.977
MEANINGFUL IN THIS SPACE. AND

02:00:18.044 --> 02:00:19.078
THAT'S WHAT I'M SEEKING TO DO

02:00:19.145 --> 02:00:21.547
WITH SB 601. AND I RESPECTFULLY

02:00:21.614 --> 02:00:22.949
ASK FOR MY VOTE. NO, I REALLY

02:00:23.015 --> 02:00:24.450
APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORT ON THIS.

02:00:24.517 --> 02:00:27.320
IT IS A COMPLEX ISSUE. I THINK

02:00:27.386 --> 02:00:29.055
THE SPIRIT WITH WHICH YOU'RE

02:00:29.121 --> 02:00:30.189
BRINGING IT, THOUGH, IS

02:00:30.256 --> 02:00:32.325
GRAPPLING WITH THIS SACKETT

02:00:32.391 --> 02:00:34.794
DECISION. KIND OF THE PROBLEMS

02:00:34.860 --> 02:00:36.963
THAT IT CREATED IN THE CONTEXT

02:00:37.029 --> 02:00:38.397
OF REALLY IN CALIFORNIA. WHAT

02:00:38.464 --> 02:00:40.933
WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS HAVE VERY

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:42.802
STRONG CLEAN WATER REGULATIONS.

02:00:42.868 --> 02:00:46.439
WE DON'T WANT TO BACKSLIDE WITH

02:00:46.505 --> 02:00:49.609
THAT. IT ALSO SOUNDS LIKE,

02:00:49.675 --> 02:00:51.677
THANKS GO TO ALL THE

02:00:51.744 --> 02:00:53.613
STAKEHOLDERS FOR CONTINUED

02:00:53.679 --> 02:00:56.549
ENGAGEMENT. YES, IT'S GOOD TO

02:00:56.616 --> 02:00:58.718
HEAR THERE WILL BE FURTHER

02:00:58.784 --> 02:00:59.986
DISCUSSIONS. WE'VE WE'VE HEARD A

02:01:00.052 --> 02:01:02.188
COUPLE OF THE KEY TOPICS. ONE IS

02:01:02.254 --> 02:01:05.091
ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS. THE

02:01:05.157 --> 02:01:06.926
OTHER AND PERHAPS THE MOST WE

02:01:06.993 --> 02:01:09.328
HEARD ABOUT IS THE DEFINITION OF

02:01:09.395 --> 02:01:10.863
NEXUS WATERS. IT SOUNDS LIKE

02:01:10.930 --> 02:01:14.467
YOU'RE CONTINUING TO TACKLE THAT

02:01:14.533 --> 02:01:18.104
FORTHWITH. PLEASE KEEP ME AND MY

02:01:18.170 --> 02:01:21.340
STAFF IN THE LOOP. WE'RE HERE TO

02:01:21.407 --> 02:01:23.442
HELP IN ANY WAY WE CAN WITH THE

02:01:23.509 --> 02:01:27.046
ONGOING LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. AT

02:01:27.113 --> 02:01:29.582
THIS JUNCTURE. THIS DOES ENJOY A

02:01:29.649 --> 02:01:31.384
HIGH RECOMMENDATION FROM THE

02:01:31.450 --> 02:01:33.619
CHAIR. WITH THAT, I WOULD ASK

02:01:33.686 --> 02:01:37.189

IS DUE PASS TO THE COMMITTEE ON

02:01:50.503 --> 02:01:52.004
APPROPRIATIONS. CONNOLLY.

02:01:52.071 --> 02:01:54.540
CONNOLLY, I. ELLIS. ELLIS. NÓ.

02:02:06.752 --> 02:02:09.655
ABSENT MEMBERS. THANK YOU. THANK

02:02:09.722 --> 02:02:11.757
YOU. THANK YOU. LET'S GET

02:02:11.824 --> 02:02:13.192
TOGETHER. WHILE WE HAVE YOU,

02:02:13.259 --> 02:02:16.762
WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO ITEM

02:02:16.829 --> 02:02:18.230
NUMBER FOUR. ALSO, SENATOR

02:02:18.297 --> 02:02:23.903
ALLEN. THIS IS SB 682 DEALING

02:02:23.969 --> 02:02:29.041
WITH PFAS. ONE OF OUR RECURRING

02:02:29.108 --> 02:02:33.245
TOPICS. THE LAST ONE TO UNDER

02:02:33.312 --> 02:02:39.585
DURESS. YEAH, WELL, THANK YOU

02:02:39.652 --> 02:02:41.420
FOR. AND YOU KNOW THIS AGAIN, IT

02:02:41.487 --> 02:02:42.955
HAS TO DO WITH WATER QUALITY.

02:02:43.022 --> 02:02:43.622
AND ACTUALLY, YOU'LL YOU'LL FIND

02:02:43.689 --> 02:02:46.025
THAT A LOT OF THE FOLKS WHO HAVE

02:02:46.092 --> 02:02:47.626
SOME NERVOUSNESS ABOUT THE LAST

02:02:47.693 --> 02:02:48.861
BILL ARE ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORTERS

02:02:48.928 --> 02:02:50.129
OF THIS ONE. BECAUSE, BECAUSE IN

02:02:50.196 --> 02:02:51.931
THE END OF THE DAY, I THINK

02:02:51.997 --> 02:02:53.599
THEY, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF THE

02:02:53.666 --> 02:02:56.368
WATER FOLKS ARE ARE REALLY ON

02:02:56.435 --> 02:02:56.969
THE HOOK FOR THE BASIC WATER

02:02:57.036 --> 02:02:57.903
QUALITY STANDARDS THAT ARE

02:02:57.970 --> 02:02:59.572
REALLY BEING THREATENED BY THE

02:02:59.638 --> 02:03:02.074
AMOUNT OF PFAS THAT ARE IN OUR

02:03:02.141 --> 02:03:05.411
WATERS. LET ME LET ME SAY, YOU

02:03:05.478 --> 02:03:07.580
KNOW, LET ME START BY SAYING I

02:03:07.646 --> 02:03:09.682
ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS,

02:03:09.749 --> 02:03:11.484
WHICH SPECIFICALLY DELAY

02:03:11.550 --> 02:03:12.651
IMPLEMENTATION ON COOKWARE

02:03:12.718 --> 02:03:15.454
PRODUCTS UNTIL 2030, WHEN WE

02:03:15.521 --> 02:03:16.922
ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED THE BILL,

02:03:16.989 --> 02:03:19.759
IT WAS A MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE

02:03:19.825 --> 02:03:22.428
BILL, BUT WE'RE NOW DOWN TO SIX

02:03:22.495 --> 02:03:24.830
PRODUCT CATEGORIES WHERE WE SEEK

02:03:24.897 --> 02:03:26.198
TO PHASE THE UNNECESSARY USE OF

02:03:26.265 --> 02:03:27.233
PFAS IN THOSE SIX CATEGORIES.

02:03:27.299 --> 02:03:29.835
AND THOSE SIX CATEGORIES WERE

02:03:29.902 --> 02:03:34.273
WERE BASICALLY CHOSEN BECAUSE

02:03:34.340 --> 02:03:35.541
THERE HAVE BEEN THERE HAVE BEEN

02:03:35.608 --> 02:03:37.009
PHASEOUTS IN OTHER PLACES IN

02:03:37.076 --> 02:03:38.778
OTHER STATES SO THAT WE KNOW

02:03:38.844 --> 02:03:39.912
THIS IS DOABLE. IT'S ALREADY

02:03:39.979 --> 02:03:41.013
HAPPENING AND IN MANY CASES

02:03:41.080 --> 02:03:42.481
ALREADY HAPPENED. SO WHAT ARE

02:03:42.548 --> 02:03:43.482
THOSE AREAS? CLEANING PRODUCTS?

02:03:43.549 --> 02:03:46.285
COOKWARE, DENTAL FLOSS, SKI WAX,

02:03:46.352 --> 02:03:48.120
FOOD PACKAGING AND JUVENILE

02:03:48.187 --> 02:03:52.057
PRODUCTS. SO WHEN WE AND OF

02:03:52.124 --> 02:03:53.893
COURSE BY BY DOING, BY MAKING BY

02:03:53.959 --> 02:03:56.395
NARROWING THE BILL IN THIS WAY,

02:03:56.462 --> 02:03:57.463
WE CERTAINLY REMOVE THE

02:03:57.530 --> 02:03:59.598
OPPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF KEY

02:03:59.665 --> 02:04:00.733
INDUSTRIES AS PART OF THE

02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:03.269
PROCESS. FOLKS HERE ARE NO

02:04:03.335 --> 02:04:04.637
STRANGER TO THE CONVERSATION

02:04:04.703 --> 02:04:07.540
ABOUT PFAS. THESE ARE THIS LARGE

02:04:07.606 --> 02:04:09.375
CLASS OF FOREVER CHEMICALS THAT

02:04:09.441 --> 02:04:10.810
PERSIST AND CONTAMINATE THE

02:04:10.876 --> 02:04:11.377
ENVIRONMENT. THEY HAVE

02:04:11.443 --> 02:04:12.311
DEMONSTRATED HARMS TO HUMAN

02:04:12.378 --> 02:04:14.513
HEALTH, EVEN AT LOW EXPOSURES.

02:04:14.580 --> 02:04:16.248
AND THEY'RE UBIQUITOUS IN MANY

02:04:16.315 --> 02:04:18.050
PRODUCTS. AND WE'VE NOW FOUND AS

02:04:18.117 --> 02:04:19.718
A RESULT OF THE UBIQUITY IN OUR

02:04:19.785 --> 02:04:20.786
ENVIRONMENT AND ALL THESE

02:04:20.853 --> 02:04:21.987
PRODUCTS, THAT TESTING IS NOW

02:04:22.054 --> 02:04:24.456
FOUND PFAS IN WATER SYSTEMS

02:04:24.523 --> 02:04:26.358
SERVING A MAJORITY OF OUR OF OUR

02:04:26.425 --> 02:04:28.861
FELLOW CALIFORNIANS. AND PFAS IS

02:04:28.928 --> 02:04:32.798
IN VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR BODIES

02:04:32.865 --> 02:04:35.301
NOW, DESPITE WHAT YOU MIGHT HEAR

02:04:35.367 --> 02:04:37.503
FROM FOLKS WHO HAVE CONCERNS,

02:04:37.570 --> 02:04:39.205
THE BILL ONLY APPLIES TO PRODUCT

02:04:39.271 --> 02:04:40.306
CATEGORIES FROM WHICH THERE ARE

02:04:40.372 --> 02:04:41.740
PFAS FREE ALTERNATIVES ON THE

02:04:41.807 --> 02:04:43.209
MARKET AT REASONABLE PRICES.

02:04:43.275 --> 02:04:44.977
THIS IS NOT SPECULATIVE. THERE

02:04:45.044 --> 02:04:48.581
ARE DEMONSTRATED PRODUCTS OUT

02:04:48.647 --> 02:04:50.482
THERE, AND THE BILL IS BASED ON

02:04:50.549 --> 02:04:52.251
OTHER STATES WITH SIMILAR BANS

02:04:52.318 --> 02:04:53.352
THAT INCLUDE COLORADO,

02:04:53.419 --> 02:04:55.120
CONNECTICUT, HAWAII, MAINE,

02:04:55.187 --> 02:04:56.222
MARYLAND, MINNESOTA, NEW YORK,

02:04:56.288 --> 02:04:57.289
OREGON, RHODE ISLAND, VERMONT

02:04:57.356 --> 02:04:58.824
AND WASHINGTON. NOW, THAT

02:04:58.891 --> 02:05:00.025
DOESN'T MEAN THAT EVERY SINGLE

02:05:00.092 --> 02:05:04.063
ONE HAS A BILL JUST LIKE THIS,

02:05:04.129 --> 02:05:09.201
BUT EVERYTHING IN OUR BILL IS

02:05:09.268 --> 02:05:10.502
BEING HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE

02:05:10.569 --> 02:05:13.539
SOMEWHERE ELSE. WE KNOW THAT

02:05:13.606 --> 02:05:14.773
CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A LEADER IN

02:05:14.840 --> 02:05:16.041
ADDRESSING THE USE OF PFAS BY

02:05:16.108 --> 02:05:17.776
BANNING IT FROM A NUMBER OF

02:05:17.843 --> 02:05:18.777
OTHER PRODUCT CATEGORIES,

02:05:18.844 --> 02:05:19.845
INCLUDING FIREFIGHTING FOAM,

02:05:19.912 --> 02:05:20.613
TEXTILES, COSMETICS, SERVING

02:05:20.679 --> 02:05:22.781
CERTAIN JUVENILE PRODUCTS,

02:05:22.848 --> 02:05:24.583
COSMETICS, PAPER, FOOD

02:05:24.650 --> 02:05:26.151
PACKAGING. I KNOW, YOU KNOW,

02:05:26.218 --> 02:05:27.453
SOME FOLKS HERE HAVE WORKED ON

02:05:27.519 --> 02:05:29.655
MENSTRUAL PRODUCTS WITH REGARDS

02:05:29.722 --> 02:05:32.825
TO PFAS AS WELL. SO I APPRECIATE

02:05:32.892 --> 02:05:34.426
YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THAT. MY WIFE

02:05:34.493 --> 02:05:37.763
ESPECIALLY APPRECIATES IT. NOW,

02:05:37.830 --> 02:05:39.698
WE KNOW THAT IN 20 LAST YEAR,

02:05:39.765 --> 02:05:41.567
THE EPA FINALIZED A RULE TO

02:05:41.634 --> 02:05:42.935
LIMIT PFAS CONTAMINATION IN

02:05:43.002 --> 02:05:44.503
DRINKING WATER BY TARGETING SIX

02:05:44.570 --> 02:05:46.872
PFAS CHEMICALS. AND BEGINNING IN

02:05:46.939 --> 02:05:48.407
2019, THE STATE WATER BOARD

02:05:48.474 --> 02:05:50.142
BEGAN REQUIRING TESTING FOR PFAS

02:05:50.209 --> 02:05:51.610
AND HAS ESTABLISHED NOTIFICATION

02:05:51.677 --> 02:05:52.912
RESPONSE LEVELS FOR FOUR PFAS

02:05:52.978 --> 02:05:55.514
CHEMICALS. SO TO COMPLY WITH OUR

02:05:55.581 --> 02:05:56.849
FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS,

02:05:56.916 --> 02:05:58.817
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE STATE

02:05:58.884 --> 02:06:00.252
ACTUALLY START ADDRESSING THE

02:06:00.319 --> 02:06:02.121
SOURCE OF THESE OF THIS

02:06:02.187 --> 02:06:03.489
CONTAMINATION BY PHASING OUT

02:06:03.555 --> 02:06:04.857
UNNECESSARY USES OF PFAS AND

02:06:04.924 --> 02:06:06.025
PRODUCTS WHERE THEY ARE

02:06:06.091 --> 02:06:07.092
ALTERNATIVES IN THE MARKET.

02:06:07.159 --> 02:06:07.893
OTHERWISE, WE'RE JUST FORCING

02:06:07.960 --> 02:06:08.994
THESE POOR WATER FOLKS TO JUST

02:06:09.061 --> 02:06:10.896
SPEND MORE AND MORE OF

02:06:10.963 --> 02:06:12.131
RATEPAYERS DOLLARS TO TRY TO

02:06:12.197 --> 02:06:13.999
COME UP WITH NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO

02:06:14.066 --> 02:06:15.534
SIFT THIS STUFF OUT OF THE WATER

02:06:15.601 --> 02:06:16.468
THAT'S GETTING INTO OUR BODIES.

02:06:16.535 --> 02:06:17.870
THAT'S REALLY HARD FOR THEM TO

02:06:17.937 --> 02:06:19.104
DO AND REALLY EXPENSIVE FOR THEM

02:06:19.171 --> 02:06:21.240
TO DO. AND SO THE IDEA HERE IS

02:06:21.307 --> 02:06:23.642
WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON THE FRONT

02:06:23.709 --> 02:06:25.711
END AND TRY TO, YOU KNOW, TRY TO

02:06:25.778 --> 02:06:26.545
SOURCE REDUCE EFFECTIVELY

02:06:26.612 --> 02:06:27.179
BECAUSE WITHOUT ADDRESSING THE

02:06:27.246 --> 02:06:28.480
SOURCE, WIDESPREAD CONTAMINATION

02:06:28.547 --> 02:06:29.415
WILL CONTINUE. IT'LL MAKE IT

02:06:29.481 --> 02:06:31.350
MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT. IT WILL

02:06:31.417 --> 02:06:32.318
RAISE RATES FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS

02:06:32.384 --> 02:06:34.086
AS THE WATER AGENCIES HAVE A

02:06:34.153 --> 02:06:35.587
HARDER AND HARDER TIME IN THE

02:06:35.654 --> 02:06:36.388
SANITATION AGENCIES HAVE A

02:06:36.455 --> 02:06:37.456
HARDER AND HARDER TIME COMPLYING

02:06:37.523 --> 02:06:38.791
WITH THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS

02:06:38.857 --> 02:06:41.827
AND STATE LAW. SO. SO YEAH, ASK

02:06:41.894 --> 02:06:44.296
FOR YOUR VOTE. I'VE GOT A COUPLE

02:06:44.363 --> 02:06:47.533
GREAT WITNESSES HERE. GO AHEAD.

02:06:47.599 --> 02:06:49.702
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. GOOD

02:06:49.768 --> 02:06:50.669
AFTERNOON, CHAIR CONNOLLY AND

02:06:50.736 --> 02:06:51.704
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I'M

02:06:51.770 --> 02:06:53.205
KATIE PELCH. I'M A SENIOR

02:06:53.272 --> 02:06:54.306
SCIENTIST AT THE NATURAL

02:06:54.373 --> 02:06:55.741
RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL, THE

02:06:55.808 --> 02:06:57.876
NRDC. AND TO PROTECT PUBLIC

02:06:57.943 --> 02:06:59.478
HEALTH, WE NEED SWIFT AND

02:06:59.545 --> 02:07:01.480
COMPREHENSIVE ACTION ON PFAS,

02:07:01.547 --> 02:07:02.948
WHICH ARE ASSOCIATED WITH

02:07:03.015 --> 02:07:04.416
NUMEROUS HEALTH HARMS, INCLUDING

02:07:04.483 --> 02:07:06.018
CANCER, PFAS RELATED HEALTH CARE

02:07:06.085 --> 02:07:07.920
COSTS FOR CALIFORNIA ARE

02:07:07.987 --> 02:07:11.991
ESTIMATED AT 5.5 TO 8.7 BILLION

02:07:12.057 --> 02:07:13.659
ANNUALLY, A BURDEN THAT HAS

02:07:13.726 --> 02:07:14.927
LARGELY BEEN BORNE BY THE PUBLIC

02:07:14.994 --> 02:07:16.929
IN CALIFORNIA HAS ALREADY SPENT

02:07:16.996 --> 02:07:18.597
OVER HALF A BILLION ON DRINKING

02:07:18.664 --> 02:07:20.332
WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL

02:07:20.399 --> 02:07:21.567
REMEDIATION, WITH A FURTHER

02:07:21.633 --> 02:07:23.802
BILLION PLANNED. THE TRADITIONAL

02:07:23.869 --> 02:07:25.104
CHEMICAL BY CHEMICAL APPROACHES

02:07:25.170 --> 02:07:26.705
HAVE FAILED TO PROTECT US FROM

02:07:26.772 --> 02:07:28.607
PFAS, WHICH IS WHY SCIENTISTS

02:07:28.674 --> 02:07:29.908
FROM AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING

02:07:29.975 --> 02:07:32.144
FROM DTSC, ARE URGING A CLASS

02:07:32.211 --> 02:07:33.746
BASED APPROACH FOR MANAGING

02:07:33.812 --> 02:07:35.381
PFAS. COMBINED WITH THE PHASE

02:07:35.447 --> 02:07:38.150
OUT OF ALL UNNECESSARY USES.

02:07:38.217 --> 02:07:39.818
CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A LEADER ON

02:07:39.885 --> 02:07:41.153
SOME OF THESE EFFORTS, AND THIS

02:07:41.220 --> 02:07:42.488
BILL WILL PHASE OUT ADDITIONAL

02:07:42.554 --> 02:07:44.056
USES OF PFAS THAT OTHER STATES

02:07:44.123 --> 02:07:45.290
HAVE ALREADY ACTED ON. AS WE

02:07:45.357 --> 02:07:47.993
JUST HEARD, PFAS ARE EXTREMELY

02:07:48.060 --> 02:07:49.328
PERSISTENT OR TRANSFORM INTO

02:07:49.395 --> 02:07:51.196
EXTREMELY PERSISTENT PFAS,

02:07:51.263 --> 02:07:52.331
LASTING FOR HUNDREDS TO

02:07:52.398 --> 02:07:53.966
THOUSANDS OF YEARS. AND BECAUSE

02:07:54.033 --> 02:07:55.768
OF THIS PERSISTENCE, ANY USE OF

02:07:55.834 --> 02:07:57.536
PFAS WILL EVENTUALLY CONTAMINATE

02:07:57.603 --> 02:07:59.071
THE ENVIRONMENT, ESPECIALLY ONCE

02:07:59.138 --> 02:08:00.572
THEY MAKE THEIR WAY INTO OUR

02:08:00.639 --> 02:08:01.440
LANDFILLS AND WASTEWATER

02:08:01.507 --> 02:08:03.809
TREATMENT FACILITIES. AN EXAMPLE

02:08:03.876 --> 02:08:05.911
OF AN UNNECESSARY USE OF PFAS IS

02:08:05.978 --> 02:08:07.613
IN NONSTICK COOKWARE, WHICH

02:08:07.679 --> 02:08:09.114
INVOLVES THE USE OF THE

02:08:09.181 --> 02:08:10.616
FLUOROPOLYMER PTFE, BETTER KNOWN

02:08:10.682 --> 02:08:13.352
AS TEFLON. DESPITE CLAIMS THAT

02:08:13.419 --> 02:08:14.987
FLUOROPOLYMERS ARE SAFE, THESE

02:08:15.054 --> 02:08:16.522
PFAS ARE PROBLEMATIC THROUGHOUT

02:08:16.588 --> 02:08:18.390
THEIR ENTIRE LIFECYCLE.

02:08:18.457 --> 02:08:19.925
FLUOROPOLYMER PRODUCTION HAS

02:08:19.992 --> 02:08:21.060
DEVASTATED COMMUNITIES ACROSS

02:08:21.126 --> 02:08:22.728
THE COUNTRY, AND THEIR POLLUTION

02:08:22.795 --> 02:08:24.530
HAS SPREAD ACROSS THE GLOBE.

02:08:24.596 --> 02:08:26.398
HEAT AND ABRASION DURING NORMAL

02:08:26.465 --> 02:08:27.766
USE AND DISPOSAL OF

02:08:27.833 --> 02:08:28.967
FLUOROPOLYMERS RESULTS IN THE

02:08:29.034 --> 02:08:30.669
RELEASE OF SMALLER, BIO

02:08:30.736 --> 02:08:32.738
ACCESSIBLE PFAS THAT ARE CAPABLE

02:08:32.805 --> 02:08:35.007
OF CAUSING ACUTE AND LONG TERM

02:08:35.074 --> 02:08:37.709
ILLNESS. COMPARISONS TO

02:08:37.776 --> 02:08:39.044
FLUOROPOLYMERS USE IN PACEMAKERS

02:08:39.111 --> 02:08:41.080
IS A RED HERRING. PACEMAKERS ARE

02:08:41.146 --> 02:08:42.681
NOT HEATED TO THE SAME

02:08:42.748 --> 02:08:43.682
TEMPERATURES AS COOKWARE, NOR

02:08:43.749 --> 02:08:45.417
ARE THEY SUBJECT TO FREQUENT

02:08:45.484 --> 02:08:47.252
ABRASION. THIS IS JUST ONE

02:08:47.319 --> 02:08:48.654
EXAMPLE OF WHERE HARMFUL IMPACTS

02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:50.956
CAN BE AVOIDED. THE USE OF PFAS

02:08:51.023 --> 02:08:52.558
WHEN THERE ARE A PLETHORA OF

02:08:52.624 --> 02:08:54.359
SAFER ALTERNATIVES IS

02:08:54.426 --> 02:08:55.527
UNJUSTIFIED, AND WE SHOULD BE

02:08:55.594 --> 02:08:56.895
AVOIDING THE USE OF HARMFUL

02:08:56.962 --> 02:08:58.497
CHEMICALS WHEREVER POSSIBLE. WE

02:08:58.564 --> 02:09:01.033
ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU.

02:09:01.100 --> 02:09:02.334
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR AND

02:09:02.401 --> 02:09:03.402
MEMBERS, I'M JESSICA GEIGER WITH

02:09:03.469 --> 02:09:04.870
THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF

02:09:04.937 --> 02:09:06.238
SANITATION AGENCIES. I'M HERE

02:09:06.305 --> 02:09:08.574
TODAY ON BEHALF OF A BROAD

02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:09.508
COALITION REPRESENTING WATER,

02:09:09.575 --> 02:09:11.043
WASTEWATER AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT

02:09:11.110 --> 02:09:12.478
ENTITIES. WE'RE ALL IN STRONG

02:09:12.544 --> 02:09:15.414
SUPPORT OF SB 682 PFAS

02:09:15.481 --> 02:09:16.348
CONTAMINATION OF OUR PUBLIC

02:09:16.415 --> 02:09:17.883
RESOURCES IS ONE OF THE MOST

02:09:17.950 --> 02:09:18.917
SIGNIFICANT WATER QUALITY

02:09:18.984 --> 02:09:20.752
CHALLENGES OF OUR TIME. THESE

02:09:20.819 --> 02:09:22.087
UBIQUITOUS CHEMICALS ARE PRESENT

02:09:22.154 --> 02:09:23.589
ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF SERVICES

02:09:23.655 --> 02:09:25.057
WE PROVIDE, AND THIS

02:09:25.124 --> 02:09:26.425
CONTAMINATION WE RECEIVE AT THE

02:09:26.492 --> 02:09:27.726
BACK END IS FROM PFAS THAT'S

02:09:27.793 --> 02:09:29.461
USED IN COMMERCE AND ULTIMATELY

02:09:29.528 --> 02:09:30.729
ENDS UP IN OUR WATERSHEDS AND

02:09:30.796 --> 02:09:32.998
OUR WASTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AS

02:09:33.065 --> 02:09:34.399
LOCAL AGENCIES PROVIDING

02:09:34.466 --> 02:09:36.568
ESSENTIAL PUBLIC SERVICES.

02:09:36.635 --> 02:09:37.603
AFFORDABILITY IS CENTRAL TO ALL

02:09:37.669 --> 02:09:39.705
THAT WE DO. STRICT REGULATORY

02:09:39.771 --> 02:09:41.273
LIMITS FOR PFAS IN DRINKING

02:09:41.340 --> 02:09:42.641
WATER WERE FINALIZED LAST YEAR

02:09:42.708 --> 02:09:45.144
BY US, EPA, AND THE COST OF

02:09:45.210 --> 02:09:47.012
COMPLIANCE FOR MEETING THESE NEW

02:09:47.079 --> 02:09:48.180
REGULATORY LIMITS FOR DRINKING

02:09:48.247 --> 02:09:50.215
WATER IS STAGGERING, AND WE

02:09:50.282 --> 02:09:50.983
ANTICIPATE THESE COSTS FOR

02:09:51.049 --> 02:09:52.718
CLEANUP WILL ONLY GROW, AS THE

02:09:52.784 --> 02:09:54.586
LIMITS HAVE BROAD IMPLICATIONS

02:09:54.653 --> 02:09:56.655
FOR NOT JUST DRINKING WATER, BUT

02:09:56.722 --> 02:09:58.457
ALL OF THE REGULATED WATER

02:09:58.524 --> 02:10:00.259
COMMUNITY. PFAS CLEANUP IS

02:10:00.325 --> 02:10:02.895
COSTLY. IT'S BURDENSOME. IT'S ON

02:10:02.961 --> 02:10:04.897
THE RATE PAYING PUBLIC. AND AT

02:10:04.963 --> 02:10:06.765
THIS TIME, EVEN IF WE GET THE

02:10:06.832 --> 02:10:08.567
PFAS OUT OF THE WATER, THERE IS

02:10:08.634 --> 02:10:10.402
NOT SCALABLE DESTRUCTION

02:10:10.469 --> 02:10:12.204
TECHNOLOGY TO ELIMINATE IT.

02:10:12.271 --> 02:10:13.672
WE'RE SIMPLY MOVING IT FROM

02:10:13.739 --> 02:10:17.543
PLACE TO PLACE. SO SB 682 WOULD

02:10:17.609 --> 02:10:20.045
IMPOSE REASONABLE LIMITS ON

02:10:20.112 --> 02:10:21.613
UNNECESSARY USES OF PFAS IN

02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:23.415
SEVERAL CATEGORIES OF CONSUMER

02:10:23.482 --> 02:10:24.750
PRODUCTS THAT HAVE A DIRECT

02:10:24.816 --> 02:10:27.419
NEXUS, BOTH TO HUMAN HEALTH AND

02:10:27.486 --> 02:10:29.121
TO OUR WASTEWATER AND

02:10:29.188 --> 02:10:30.222
WATERSHEDS. MORE BROADLY,

02:10:30.289 --> 02:10:31.657
BANNING PFAS IN THESE PRODUCTS

02:10:31.723 --> 02:10:33.492
IS A COMPLEMENT TO THE

02:10:33.559 --> 02:10:34.860
REMEDIATION EFFORTS ALREADY

02:10:34.927 --> 02:10:36.662
UNDERWAY IN THE WATER SECTOR. IT

02:10:36.728 --> 02:10:38.530
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO INVEST IN

02:10:38.597 --> 02:10:40.132
CLEANING UP PFAS CONTAMINATION

02:10:40.199 --> 02:10:41.800
WHILE ALLOWING FOR THE CONTINUED

02:10:41.867 --> 02:10:43.802
USE OF AVOIDABLE PFAS, WHICH

02:10:43.869 --> 02:10:45.804
WILL CONTINUE EXPOSING OUR

02:10:45.871 --> 02:10:47.105
COMMUNITIES TO THESE TOXIC

02:10:47.172 --> 02:10:49.274
CHEMICALS. THIS IS A TRUE SOURCE

02:10:49.341 --> 02:10:50.676
CONTROL BILL IN THAT IT PROVIDES

02:10:50.742 --> 02:10:53.879
TOP DOWN AND SYSTEMATIC APPROACH

02:10:53.946 --> 02:10:55.747
TO REDUCING SOURCES OF PFAS

02:10:55.814 --> 02:10:57.115
CONTAMINATION IN A WAY THAT

02:10:57.182 --> 02:10:58.984
DOESN'T FURTHER BURDEN THE RATE

02:10:59.051 --> 02:11:00.352
PAYING PUBLIC ON THE BACK END.

02:11:00.419 --> 02:11:02.187
SO FOR THESE REASONS, OUR

02:11:02.254 --> 02:11:03.655
COALITION IS STRONGLY IN SUPPORT

02:11:03.722 --> 02:11:05.357
OF SB 682 AND WOULD URGE YOUR

02:11:05.424 --> 02:11:07.693
AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE

02:11:07.759 --> 02:11:10.229
OTHER SUPPORT OF THE BILL? COME

02:11:10.295 --> 02:11:14.766

OPPOSED POSITION. THE BILL

02:15:33.091 --> 02:15:34.426
PROHIBITS THE SALE OR

COULD PENALIZE COMPLIANT

MANUFACTURERS. I DO WANT TO

02:16:47.332 --> 02:16:50.368
EMPHASIZE THAT THE BILL INCLUDES

02:16:50.435 --> 02:16:51.970

02:16:52.037 --> 02:16:53.705
BAN THAT WOULD EXTEND TO

02:16:53.772 --> 02:16:54.973

02:16:55.040 --> 02:16:56.908
THROUGH CALIFORNIA, THREATENING

02:16:56.975 --> 02:16:58.677
LOGISTICS OPERATIONS, AND

02:16:58.743 --> 02:17:00.612
INCENTIVIZING MANUFACTURERS TO

CALIFORNIA JOBS AND THE ECONOMIC

02:17:08.153 --> 02:17:09.154
COMPETITIVENESS. WE STRONGLY

02:17:09.220 --> 02:17:10.789
URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO

PROTECTS PUBLIC HEALTH WITHOUT

02:17:18.496 --> 02:17:20.665
UNDERMINING THE RESPONSIBLE

02:17:20.732 --> 02:17:23.501
MANUFACTURERS AND SUPPLY CHAIN

02:17:23.568 --> 02:17:27.172

AND THANK YOU TO THE SPONSOR AND

02:17:31.042 --> 02:17:32.577
STAFF, AS WELL AS COMMITTEE

02:17:32.644 --> 02:17:34.346
CONSULTANTS FOR WORKING WITH US

02:17:34.412 --> 02:17:35.380
OVER THE PAST COUPLE, COUPLE

02:17:35.447 --> 02:17:37.282
MONTHS. REALLY, I'M STEVE BURNS.

02:17:37.349 --> 02:17:39.117
I'M HERE REPRESENTING TWO

02:17:39.184 --> 02:17:40.952
DIFFERENT GROUPS IN THE COOKWARE

02:17:41.019 --> 02:17:42.988
SPACE. I'D LIKE TO MAKE THREE

02:17:43.054 --> 02:17:45.190
QUICK POINTS, IF I MAY. THE

02:17:45.256 --> 02:17:46.191
FIRST ONE IS THAT BANNING

02:17:46.257 --> 02:17:47.259
COOKWARE ISN'T GOING TO SOLVE

02:17:47.325 --> 02:17:50.996
ANY PROBLEMS, DESPITE WHAT A

02:17:51.062 --> 02:17:52.697
WITNESS SAID JUST MOMENTS AGO.

02:17:52.764 --> 02:17:54.199
PTF, WHICH WENT BY THE TRADE

02:17:54.265 --> 02:17:56.601
NAME OF TEFLON, HAS BEEN SHOWN

02:17:56.668 --> 02:17:59.537
FOR DECADES TO BE INERT. IT DOES

02:17:59.604 --> 02:18:02.340
NOT BIOACCUMULATE AND IT IS TOO

02:18:02.407 --> 02:18:04.175
LARGE TO PENETRATE A CELL

02:18:04.242 --> 02:18:05.543
MEMBRANE. AND IN FACT, I THINK

02:18:05.610 --> 02:18:07.379
THE SPONSOR KICKED OFF THIS

02:18:07.445 --> 02:18:08.213
CONVERSATION BY SAYING THIS HAS

02:18:08.279 --> 02:18:10.615
TO DO WITH WATER QUALITY. PTF IS

02:18:10.682 --> 02:18:12.984
NOT WATER SOLUBLE. IT'S BEEN

02:18:13.051 --> 02:18:14.786
SHOWN NOT TO BE ABLE TO BIND

02:18:14.853 --> 02:18:16.855
WITH ANY, ANY WATER FOR DECADES

02:18:16.921 --> 02:18:20.759
NOW. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY TO THE

02:18:20.825 --> 02:18:21.860
COMMENT OF ADDRESSING THE SOURCE

02:18:21.926 --> 02:18:25.363
OF PFAS COOKWARE USES ABOUT 5%

02:18:25.430 --> 02:18:28.566
OF GLOBAL PTF PRODUCTION, AND

02:18:28.633 --> 02:18:31.770
THAT PTFE PRODUCTION IS 10% OF

02:18:31.836 --> 02:18:34.339
GLOBAL PFAS PRODUCTION. SO

02:18:34.406 --> 02:18:36.574
ADDRESSING COOKWARE NONSTICK,

02:18:36.641 --> 02:18:39.044
PTF IS GOING TO ADDRESS LESS

02:18:39.110 --> 02:18:42.614
THAN ONE HALF OF 1% OF THE

02:18:42.681 --> 02:18:43.314
WORLD'S PFAS PRODUCTION, LESS

02:18:43.381 --> 02:18:45.750
THAN ONE HALF OF 1%. THE SECOND

02:18:45.817 --> 02:18:47.285
POINT I'D MAKE IS IT HAS BEEN

02:18:47.352 --> 02:18:49.120
SAID THERE'S ACTUALLY SIX STATES

02:18:49.187 --> 02:18:51.222
THAT HAVE BANNED COOKWARE

02:18:51.289 --> 02:18:53.725
ALREADY, THREE OF THEM IN THE

02:18:53.792 --> 02:18:54.926
NORTHEASTERN PART OF THE

02:18:54.993 --> 02:18:56.261
COUNTRY, WHERE CHEMICAL

02:18:56.327 --> 02:18:58.263
PRODUCTION HAS A LONG AND VERY

02:18:58.329 --> 02:18:59.531
UNPOPULAR HISTORY. FOR GOOD

02:18:59.597 --> 02:19:01.833
REASON. THOSE THREE STATES

02:19:01.900 --> 02:19:03.601
COLLECTIVELY MAKE UP 1% OF THE

02:19:03.668 --> 02:19:05.737
UNITED STATES POPULATION. A

02:19:05.804 --> 02:19:06.905
FOURTH OF THE SIX, THE GOVERNOR

02:19:06.971 --> 02:19:08.473
OF CONNECTICUT SAID PUBLICLY IN

02:19:08.540 --> 02:19:10.775
HIS SIGNING MESSAGE THAT HE WAS.

02:19:10.842 --> 02:19:12.043
THIS IS A QUOTE I'M CONCERNED

02:19:12.110 --> 02:19:13.511
THIS COULD MEAN, AMONG OTHER

02:19:13.578 --> 02:19:15.013
THINGS, THAT TEFLON NONSTICK

02:19:15.080 --> 02:19:17.749
PANS COULD BE UNAVAILABLE. AND

02:19:17.816 --> 02:19:19.718
THEN VERMONT, THE FIFTH OF THE

02:19:19.784 --> 02:19:21.853
SIX, JUST DELAYED THEIR COOKWARE

02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:23.555
BAN FOR TWO AND A HALF

02:19:23.621 --> 02:19:25.356
ADDITIONAL YEARS. IN RESPONSE TO

02:19:25.423 --> 02:19:27.058
THE FACTS THAT WE BROUGHT TO

02:19:27.125 --> 02:19:29.594
THEM ABOUT TÊ. SO YES, THERE HAS

02:19:29.661 --> 02:19:30.995
BEEN PRECEDENT IN OTHER STATES

02:19:31.062 --> 02:19:32.297
AROUND THE COUNTRY, BUT SEVERAL

02:19:32.363 --> 02:19:34.799
OF THEM ARE BACKTRACKING. WHAT'S

02:19:34.866 --> 02:19:36.401
HAPPENED THIS YEAR IN JUST SIX

02:19:36.468 --> 02:19:39.637
AND A HALF MONTHS OF 2025, THERE

02:19:39.704 --> 02:19:41.005
HAVE BEEN THREE STATES THAT HAVE

02:19:41.072 --> 02:19:42.774
DONE THE OPPOSITE. THEY'VE

02:19:42.841 --> 02:19:44.209
EITHER EXCLUDED COOKWARE OR

02:19:44.275 --> 02:19:46.644
THEY'RE EXCLUDING ALL PTFE. AND

02:19:46.711 --> 02:19:49.214
WE COUNT ILLINOIS AND OHIO AMONG

02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:51.116
THOSE STATES, THE SIXTH AND

02:19:51.182 --> 02:19:52.417
SEVENTH MOST POPULOUS STATES IN

02:19:52.484 --> 02:19:54.052
THE COUNTRY. THREE MORE STATES

02:19:54.119 --> 02:19:56.087
HAVE WALKED AWAY ENTIRELY FROM

02:19:56.154 --> 02:19:58.189
PFAS BANS. NEW YORK IS ONE OF

02:19:58.256 --> 02:19:59.457
THESE THREE, THE FOURTH MOST

02:19:59.524 --> 02:20:01.126
POPULOUS STATE IN THE COUNTRY.

02:20:01.192 --> 02:20:02.927
IN OTHER WORDS, IN 2025, NO

02:20:02.994 --> 02:20:05.663
STATE HAS BANNED COOKWARE THIS

02:20:05.730 --> 02:20:07.565
YEAR. AND FRANKLY, WE'RE THE

02:20:07.632 --> 02:20:09.868
ONLY ONES THAT ARE GOING ABOUT

02:20:09.934 --> 02:20:11.836
THIS IN A WAY THAT WE BELIEVE

02:20:11.903 --> 02:20:13.738
OUR ORGANIZATION IGNORES THE

02:20:13.805 --> 02:20:16.307
SCIENCE OF PTFE AND HOW IT IS

02:20:16.374 --> 02:20:18.977
DIFFERENT FROM PFOA AND PFOS.

02:20:19.043 --> 02:20:20.078
THE FINAL POINT I'D MAKE, AND

02:20:20.145 --> 02:20:22.413
THIS WAS TOUCHED ON BY MY

02:20:22.480 --> 02:20:23.848
COLLEAGUE, THAT THE BILL ALSO

02:20:23.915 --> 02:20:25.650
WOULD BAN THE DISTRIBUTION OF

02:20:25.717 --> 02:20:27.585
NONSTICK COOKWARE. THE COMPANIES

02:20:27.652 --> 02:20:29.220
THAT WE REPRESENT BRING THESE

02:20:29.287 --> 02:20:30.121
PRODUCTS IN THROUGH THE PORTS OF

02:20:30.188 --> 02:20:32.056
LONG BEACH, THE PORTS OF LA,

02:20:32.123 --> 02:20:33.458
PORT OF OAKLAND. THEY'LL GO TO A

02:20:33.525 --> 02:20:34.759
SHIPPING WAREHOUSE, THEY'LL GO

02:20:34.826 --> 02:20:36.327
TO A DISTRIBUTION CENTER. FROM

02:20:36.394 --> 02:20:38.229
THERE, THEY GET PUT ON RAIL OR

02:20:38.296 --> 02:20:39.631
TRUCK AND DISTRIBUTED AROUND THE

02:20:39.697 --> 02:20:41.065
COUNTRY. ONE OF THE COMPANIES

02:20:41.132 --> 02:20:43.268
THAT WE REPRESENT HAS 30 JOBS IN

02:20:43.334 --> 02:20:44.502
COMPTON, CALIFORNIA, THAT

02:20:44.569 --> 02:20:46.271
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PULL UP

02:20:46.337 --> 02:20:49.007
AND MOVE OUT OF STATE BY LAW.

02:20:49.073 --> 02:20:50.375
AND ALL OF THE OTHER COMPANIES

02:20:50.441 --> 02:20:51.843
THAT WE REPRESENT ARE ALSO GOING

02:20:51.910 --> 02:20:53.678
TO LOOK AT THEIR DISTRIBUTION

02:20:53.745 --> 02:20:55.113
SYSTEMS. AND THIS ISN'T JUST THE

02:20:55.180 --> 02:20:56.181
COOKWARE IN EVERYBODY'S KITCHEN.

02:20:56.247 --> 02:20:59.117
THERE'S 110,000 RESTAURANTS IN

02:20:59.184 --> 02:21:00.919
CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE 1000 FOOD

02:21:00.985 --> 02:21:03.121
TRUCKS. I GUARANTEE THE VAST

02:21:03.188 --> 02:21:04.889
MAJORITY OF THOSE HAVE NONSTICK

02:21:04.956 --> 02:21:06.958
PRODUCTS. THE ANSWER MIGHT BE,

02:21:07.025 --> 02:21:08.159
WELL, WE'RE NOT BANNING IT.

02:21:08.226 --> 02:21:09.928
TODAY'S EXISTING TECHNOLOGY. BUT

02:21:09.994 --> 02:21:12.397
ONCE WORD GETS AROUND THAT THE

02:21:12.463 --> 02:21:14.265
CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS FOUND

02:21:14.332 --> 02:21:16.801
NONSTICK TO BE IN ANY WAY

02:21:16.868 --> 02:21:18.203
HARMFUL TO HUMAN HEALTH, I

02:21:18.269 --> 02:21:20.004
GUARANTEE THAT A LOT OF SMALL

02:21:20.071 --> 02:21:21.105
BUSINESSES, FAMILY OWNED

02:21:21.172 --> 02:21:22.273
BUSINESSES, ARE GOING TO HAVE TO

02:21:22.340 --> 02:21:24.075
GO OUT AND LOOK FOR ANOTHER

02:21:24.142 --> 02:21:26.544
ALTERNATIVE. SO I URGE A NO

02:21:26.611 --> 02:21:31.149
VOTE. THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE ANY

02:21:31.216 --> 02:21:33.051

LIGHT OF THE AUTHOR TAKING THE

2030 AMENDMENT, WE BELIEVE THAT

02:23:15.386 --> 02:23:16.754

PRESENTATION. AGAIN, I'LL BORE

02:23:38.443 --> 02:23:42.413
YOU WITH SCIENCE FOR A SECOND.

02:23:42.480 --> 02:23:44.749
HOW DO THEY DETERMINE PFAS? DO

02:23:44.816 --> 02:23:46.117
THEY USE MASS SPECTROMETRY?

02:23:46.184 --> 02:23:48.853
WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE ANALYTICAL

02:23:48.920 --> 02:23:51.522
METHOD FOR DETERMINING PFAS?

02:23:51.589 --> 02:23:52.790
DOES ANYBODY KNOW? DETERMINE

02:23:52.857 --> 02:23:54.225
WHAT IS PFAS? NO, NO, I KNOW

02:23:54.292 --> 02:23:56.627
WHAT PFAS IS. WHAT WHAT

02:23:56.694 --> 02:23:58.029
ANALYTICAL METHOD DO THEY USE TO

02:23:58.096 --> 02:23:59.497
DETERMINE IT? SO RIGHT NOW IN

02:23:59.564 --> 02:24:01.366
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO

02:24:01.432 --> 02:24:03.101
ADDRESS THIS FOR THE OTHER

02:24:03.167 --> 02:24:04.802
CHEMICALS ARE FOR THE OTHER

02:24:04.869 --> 02:24:06.304
CONSUMER PRODUCTS THAT THE STATE

02:24:06.371 --> 02:24:08.072
IS ALREADY REGULATING.

02:24:08.139 --> 02:24:09.407
CALIFORNIA USES THE TOTAL

02:24:09.474 --> 02:24:14.946
ORGANOFLUORINE METHOD. OKAY. SO.

02:24:15.013 --> 02:24:18.149
LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT SOLUBILITY.

02:24:18.216 --> 02:24:20.218
IS THERE A METHOD TO DETERMINE

02:24:20.284 --> 02:24:22.153
SOLUBILITY? FOR EXAMPLE, THE 100

02:24:22.220 --> 02:24:25.723
YEAR ACID LEACHING TECHNIQUE.

02:24:25.790 --> 02:24:28.159
WHAT WHAT WHAT TECHNIQUE DO YOU

02:24:28.226 --> 02:24:32.163
USE FOR SOLUBILITY? I DON'T KNOW

02:24:32.230 --> 02:24:34.165
THAT THERE IS A TECHNIQUE THAT

02:24:34.232 --> 02:24:36.034
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS USING

02:24:36.100 --> 02:24:37.335
TO DETERMINE SOLUBILITY, BUT WE

02:24:37.402 --> 02:24:39.270
DO KNOW THAT SOLUBLE CHEMICALS

02:24:39.337 --> 02:24:41.105
DO ESCAPE FROM FLUOROPOLYMERS

02:24:41.172 --> 02:24:42.807
LIKE TEFLON AND PTFE. WHAT ARE

02:24:42.874 --> 02:24:44.909
THOSE CHEMICALS? THERE HAVE BEEN

02:24:44.976 --> 02:24:46.110
MANY CHEMICALS THROUGHOUT

02:24:46.177 --> 02:24:50.248
HISTORY. HISTORICALLY, PFOA CAN

02:24:50.314 --> 02:24:54.152
LEACH OFF OF THE TEFLON, BUT

02:24:54.218 --> 02:24:56.254
ALSO NOW THAT THEY ARE NOT USING

02:24:56.320 --> 02:24:58.456
PFOA, WE KNOW THAT GEN X IS

02:24:58.523 --> 02:25:00.591
PRESENT. WE KNOW THAT VERY, VERY

02:25:00.658 --> 02:25:02.827
SMALL CHEMICALS LIKE TFA

02:25:02.894 --> 02:25:04.262
TRIFLUOROACETIC ACID CAN ALSO

02:25:04.328 --> 02:25:06.197
LEACH. THIS IS A PFAS THAT IS

02:25:06.264 --> 02:25:07.732
BEING FOUND AT ALARMING LEVELS

02:25:07.799 --> 02:25:09.000
IN OUR ENVIRONMENT AND IN OUR

02:25:09.067 --> 02:25:12.770
BODIES. AT WHAT PH AND AT WHAT

02:25:12.837 --> 02:25:15.506
TEMPERATURE? AND I AM I HAVE

02:25:15.573 --> 02:25:17.775
THOSE STUDIES THAT I COULD SEND

02:25:17.842 --> 02:25:18.342
YOU, BUT I DON'T KNOW THOSE

02:25:18.409 --> 02:25:20.311
EXACT DETAILS AT THIS. OFF THE

02:25:20.378 --> 02:25:25.483
TOP OF MY HEAD. SO. IS THERE ANY

02:25:25.550 --> 02:25:31.289
STANDARDIZED TESTING FOR

02:25:31.355 --> 02:25:38.529
SOLUBILITY OF PFAS? DO YOU KNOW

02:25:38.596 --> 02:25:42.567
WHAT TEMPERATURE TEFLON GOES

02:25:42.633 --> 02:25:48.172
INTO? SOLUTION? SORRY, WAS IT

02:25:48.239 --> 02:25:50.041
THE 2000? NO. I'M CURIOUS

02:25:50.108 --> 02:25:51.676
BECAUSE. BECAUSE WHERE I'M GOING

02:25:51.742 --> 02:25:53.978
WITH MY COMMENTS. ASSEMBLY

02:25:54.045 --> 02:25:56.013
MEMBER, ARE THAT WE WANT TO PUT

02:25:56.080 --> 02:25:57.982
FORTH SOME. I THINK IF I WAS A

02:25:58.049 --> 02:26:00.351
JUDGE, THIS WOULD BE A SHORT

02:26:00.418 --> 02:26:02.620
LEASH AT THIS POINT. BUT WE'RE

02:26:02.687 --> 02:26:05.256
GOING TO GIVE YOU. OKAY. I'LL

02:26:05.323 --> 02:26:07.692
GET TO I'LL GET TO MY POINT. I'M

02:26:07.759 --> 02:26:10.194
CONCERNED THAT THERE IS NO

02:26:10.261 --> 02:26:11.195
STANDARDIZATION. AND MY

02:26:11.262 --> 02:26:13.931
COMMENTS. THANK YOU. APPRECIATE

02:26:13.998 --> 02:26:19.370
IT. OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.

02:26:19.437 --> 02:26:21.372
SEE IF YOU CAN BE THAT

02:26:21.439 --> 02:26:24.442
TECHNICAL. I DON'T INTEND TO BE.

02:26:24.509 --> 02:26:26.777
I HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF

02:26:26.844 --> 02:26:28.045
SITTING HERE FOR SIX PLUS YEARS

02:26:28.112 --> 02:26:29.580
NOW, WATCHING THE SENATOR DO

02:26:29.647 --> 02:26:31.749
INCREDIBLE WORK ON TOXINS THAT I

02:26:31.816 --> 02:26:33.851
KNOW HE, I'M SURE IN HIS OWN

02:26:33.918 --> 02:26:35.086
HOME, ENSURES HIS CHILDREN ARE

02:26:35.153 --> 02:26:36.320
NOT EXPOSED TO BECAUSE OF THE

02:26:36.387 --> 02:26:38.856
HARMS THAT THEY POSE. AND HIS

02:26:38.923 --> 02:26:40.591
EFFORTS TO PROTECT THE REST OF

02:26:40.658 --> 02:26:41.759
CALIFORNIA, I THINK, ARE

02:26:41.826 --> 02:26:42.560
INCREDIBLE AND LAUDABLE AND

02:26:42.627 --> 02:26:44.362
BASED DEEPLY IN HIS INTELLIGENCE

02:26:44.428 --> 02:26:46.898
AND THE SCIENCE THAT HE SPENDS.

02:26:46.964 --> 02:26:49.066
I KNOW A LOT OF TIME IN BECAUSE

02:26:49.133 --> 02:26:52.203
HE IS A THOUGHTFUL AUTHOR, BUT I

02:26:52.270 --> 02:26:53.971
GUESS I'M A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED

02:26:54.038 --> 02:26:55.206
BY THE OPPOSITION'S TESTIMONY ON

02:26:55.273 --> 02:26:59.043
THE TEFLON. AS SOMEONE WHO LONG

02:26:59.110 --> 02:27:00.845
AGO DECIDED IT WASN'T WORTH THE

02:27:00.912 --> 02:27:02.113
POTENTIAL RISKS AND TOOK THEM

02:27:02.180 --> 02:27:04.949
OUT OF MY OWN HOME, I HAVE NOT

02:27:05.016 --> 02:27:06.317
SUFFERED ONE DAY SINCE I MADE

02:27:06.384 --> 02:27:09.187
THOSE CHOICES. I HAVE GREAT

02:27:09.253 --> 02:27:10.988
ALTERNATIVES. I USE CAST IRON

02:27:11.055 --> 02:27:13.491
MOSTLY, BUT THERE ARE ALSO OTHER

02:27:13.558 --> 02:27:14.559
ALTERNATIVES NONSTICK

02:27:14.625 --> 02:27:15.326
ALTERNATIVES. AND SO I GUESS I'M

02:27:15.393 --> 02:27:18.896
JUST SUPER CONFUSED BY THE

02:27:18.963 --> 02:27:19.997
TESTIMONY THAT WE'RE GOING TO

02:27:20.064 --> 02:27:23.334
CREATE THIS MASSIVE HARM BY

02:27:23.401 --> 02:27:24.602
GETTING RID OF SOMETHING THAT

02:27:24.669 --> 02:27:28.139
CAUSES POTENTIAL HARM. LIKE I

02:27:28.206 --> 02:27:30.641
JUST DON'T SEE IT. I DON'T SEE

02:27:30.708 --> 02:27:32.510
WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT. WE'LL

02:27:32.577 --> 02:27:34.712
START WITH THE TEFLON MARKET

02:27:34.779 --> 02:27:38.382
OVERALL IS ABOUT 60 TO 70%. SO

02:27:38.449 --> 02:27:40.484
THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PREFERS

02:27:40.551 --> 02:27:41.786
NONSTICK COOKWARE. AND THERE'S A

02:27:41.852 --> 02:27:43.788
REASON FOR THAT. TO YOUR POINT

02:27:43.854 --> 02:27:46.157
ABOUT CAST IRON. CAST IRON

02:27:46.224 --> 02:27:48.426
REQUIRES SOME FOUGHT SOME FORM

02:27:48.492 --> 02:27:50.528
OF OIL OR BUTTER. IT CAN'T JUST

02:27:50.595 --> 02:27:52.363
COOK FOOD ON ITS OWN. YOUR FISH

02:27:52.430 --> 02:27:54.198
WOULD STICK TO IT TERRIBLY. THE

02:27:54.265 --> 02:27:56.667
SAME IS TRUE FOR METAL OR GLASS.

02:27:56.734 --> 02:27:58.502
THOSE ARE NOT HARMFUL. THOSE ARE

02:27:58.569 --> 02:28:01.005
NOT HEALTHY. THEY CREATE TOXINS

02:28:01.072 --> 02:28:02.840
WHEN THEY GET TO A CERTAIN

02:28:02.907 --> 02:28:04.942
TEMPERATURE. A NONSTICK PAN

02:28:05.009 --> 02:28:06.444
NEEDS NOTHING ON IT. AN EGG CAN

02:28:06.510 --> 02:28:08.512
BE PLACED ON IT DIRECTLY, AND IT

02:28:08.579 --> 02:28:10.014
CAN BE CLEANED WITH A WIPE OF A

02:28:10.081 --> 02:28:12.750
OF A PAPER TOWEL. SO THERE ARE

02:28:12.817 --> 02:28:13.684
BOTH HEALTH ISSUES AND THERE'S

02:28:13.751 --> 02:28:15.653
PERSONAL CHOICE ISSUES, BUT IT'S

02:28:15.720 --> 02:28:18.556
REALLY IT GETS TO THE, THE

02:28:18.623 --> 02:28:19.991
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. BECAUSE

02:28:20.057 --> 02:28:22.560
THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE THAT PEOPLE

02:28:22.627 --> 02:28:24.362
SAY IS GOING TO REPLACE NONSTICK

02:28:24.428 --> 02:28:26.464
COOKWARE IS CERAMICS. NOW,

02:28:26.530 --> 02:28:27.965
CERAMICS ARE NOT THE POTTED

02:28:28.032 --> 02:28:29.800
PLANTS THAT WE ALL SEE IN OUR

02:28:29.867 --> 02:28:30.601
BACKYARD. CERAMICS ARE ACTUALLY

02:28:30.668 --> 02:28:33.804
VERY SOPHISTICATED NEW FORMS OF

02:28:33.871 --> 02:28:37.074
SOL GEL, WHICH IS A MESH THAT IS

02:28:37.141 --> 02:28:39.877
HAS SOL SILICON OIL PLACED IN

02:28:39.944 --> 02:28:41.712
BETWEEN TWO LAYERS. AND WHEN

02:28:41.779 --> 02:28:43.481
IT'S HEATED, THE SILICON OIL

02:28:43.547 --> 02:28:46.417
WILL SLOWLY EEK UP TO THE TOP,

02:28:46.484 --> 02:28:48.486
AND IT WILL APPEAR AS IF YOU

02:28:48.552 --> 02:28:50.588
HAVE A NONSTICK COAT THAT LASTS

02:28:50.655 --> 02:28:52.823
ABOUT A YEAR, WHEREAS A NONSTICK

02:28:52.890 --> 02:28:55.393
PAN WILL LAST 10 TO 12 YEARS. SO

02:28:55.459 --> 02:28:56.227
YOU'RE REPLACING THEM. THEY'RE

02:28:56.294 --> 02:28:58.162
MORE EXPENSIVE, AND QUITE

02:28:58.229 --> 02:28:59.997
FRANKLY, WE'VE BEEN TOLD BY

02:29:00.064 --> 02:29:01.699
REGULATORS THAT THE TYPE OF

02:29:01.766 --> 02:29:03.634
SCRUTINY THAT I BELIEVE IN ON

02:29:03.701 --> 02:29:05.569
PTFE AND FLUOROPOLYMERS, WHICH

02:29:05.636 --> 02:29:07.905
HAS HAPPENED FOR 30 TO 40 YEARS,

02:29:07.972 --> 02:29:09.807
HAS NOT EVEN COME CLOSE TO

02:29:09.874 --> 02:29:10.775
REALLY LOOKING AT WHAT THE

02:29:10.841 --> 02:29:12.943
CHEMICALS ARE IN CERAMICS. AND

02:29:13.010 --> 02:29:14.779
THE GUARDIAN, JUST A COUPLE OF

02:29:14.845 --> 02:29:15.946
WEEKS AGO HAD A WONDERFUL PIECE

02:29:16.013 --> 02:29:17.281
ABOUT THIS. THERE'S A LOT OF

02:29:17.348 --> 02:29:18.883
QUESTIONS. SO FOR FORCING AWAY

02:29:18.949 --> 02:29:20.551
FROM ONE PRODUCT TO ANOTHER, ONE

02:29:20.618 --> 02:29:21.986
THAT'S MORE EXPENSIVE, LESS, FAR

02:29:22.053 --> 02:29:24.822
LESS FREQUENTLY, WILL END UP IN

02:29:24.889 --> 02:29:25.523
LANDFILL MORE OFTEN AND

02:29:25.589 --> 02:29:27.358
CHEMICALLY, HAS NOT BEEN TESTED

02:29:27.425 --> 02:29:29.493
OVER MANY, MANY YEARS. WE THINK

02:29:29.560 --> 02:29:30.961
THAT'S A BIT HASTY. SO I THINK

02:29:31.028 --> 02:29:33.798
IT'S A FAIR POINT AND ONE THAT,

02:29:33.864 --> 02:29:35.166
YOU KNOW, BPA, I THINK IS THE

02:29:35.232 --> 02:29:37.034
CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF CALIFORNIA

02:29:37.101 --> 02:29:38.102
BANNING SOMETHING AND GETTING

02:29:38.169 --> 02:29:39.236
REGRETTABLE ALTERNATIVES. RIGHT.

02:29:39.303 --> 02:29:41.839
WHICH IS WHY ANOTHER PIECE OF

02:29:41.906 --> 02:29:43.641
THE SENATOR'S WORK WAS TRYING TO

02:29:43.708 --> 02:29:45.242
GET DTSC TO ACTUALLY DO THEIR

02:29:45.309 --> 02:29:47.178
JOB, WHICH, DESPITE YOUR BEST

02:29:47.244 --> 02:29:49.113
EFFORTS, I'M NOT SURE WE

02:29:49.180 --> 02:29:51.849
COMPLETELY SUCCEEDED ON SENATOR,

02:29:51.916 --> 02:29:53.284
BECAUSE THAT IS ONE OF THEIR

02:29:53.351 --> 02:29:54.952
CHARGES IN THE GREEN CHEMISTRY

02:29:55.019 --> 02:29:56.520
DIVISION IS TO LOOK AT

02:29:56.587 --> 02:29:57.855
REGRETTABLE ALTERNATIVES. WHAT

02:29:57.922 --> 02:29:59.690
DO THEY DO? ONE CHEMICAL EVERY

02:29:59.757 --> 02:30:02.093
FIVE YEARS OR SOMETHING LIKE

02:30:02.159 --> 02:30:03.561
THAT. SO THAT'S A CONVERSATION

02:30:03.627 --> 02:30:05.496
FOR ANOTHER DAY, I GUESS. BUT I

02:30:05.563 --> 02:30:07.264
MEAN, IT'S A FAIR POINT THAT

02:30:07.331 --> 02:30:08.032
YOU'RE CONCERNED THAT WE'RE

02:30:08.099 --> 02:30:10.434
GOING TO LAND WITH REGRETTABLE

02:30:10.501 --> 02:30:11.001
ALTERNATIVES. DO YOU HAVE A

02:30:11.068 --> 02:30:14.105
RESPONSE TO THAT? SURE. I MEAN,

02:30:14.171 --> 02:30:15.906
WE NEED TO MAKE CAREFUL

02:30:15.973 --> 02:30:17.241
DECISIONS AND LOOK AT THE BROAD

02:30:17.308 --> 02:30:19.310
LANDSCAPE, RIGHT? BUT ALREADY,

02:30:19.377 --> 02:30:20.945
LIKE THE STATE OF MINNESOTA IS,

02:30:21.011 --> 02:30:23.114
OUR ALREADY HAS MANY

02:30:23.180 --> 02:30:24.148
ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE

02:30:24.215 --> 02:30:25.116
AFFORDABLE, THAT ARE AVAILABLE,

02:30:25.182 --> 02:30:26.617
LIKE YOU SAID, THAT WE'RE NOT

02:30:26.684 --> 02:30:28.185
THE PEOPLE IN THESE STATES OR

02:30:28.252 --> 02:30:29.186
THESE BILLS ARE GOING INTO

02:30:29.253 --> 02:30:31.422
EFFECT ARE NOT WITH A LACK OF

02:30:31.489 --> 02:30:33.157
ALTERNATIVES, AND THERE ARE SAFE

02:30:33.224 --> 02:30:34.492
ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE AVAILABLE.

02:30:34.558 --> 02:30:36.160
I ALSO WOULD JUST LIKE TO POINT

02:30:36.227 --> 02:30:38.195
OUT THAT THE INDUSTRY ITSELF, ON

02:30:38.262 --> 02:30:40.064
WEBSITES WHERE YOU MIGHT GO BUY

02:30:40.131 --> 02:30:42.233
A NONSTICK PAN, RECOMMENDS

02:30:42.299 --> 02:30:43.667
THROWING OUT AND DISPOSING YOUR

02:30:43.734 --> 02:30:46.170
NONSTICK PAN THAT'S PTFE COATED

02:30:46.237 --> 02:30:47.605
WITH A SINGLE SCRATCH, OR AT

02:30:47.671 --> 02:30:49.840
LEAST EVERY FIVE YEARS. SO THE

02:30:49.907 --> 02:30:51.275
STATEMENT THAT THESE LAST

02:30:51.342 --> 02:30:53.411
FOREVER ON THEIR COOKWARE AND

02:30:53.477 --> 02:30:54.845
THAT, YOU KNOW, THESE ARE REALLY

02:30:54.912 --> 02:30:55.913
LONG LASTING PRODUCTS IS A

02:30:55.980 --> 02:30:58.182
LITTLE BIT MOOT BY THEIR OWN

02:30:58.249 --> 02:30:59.450
EVIDENCE. BUT YOU DIDN'T

02:30:59.517 --> 02:31:00.651
ADDRESS. AND I AGREE, THE

02:31:00.718 --> 02:31:02.119
SCRATCHING IS, I THINK, A REALLY

02:31:02.186 --> 02:31:03.587
IMPORTANT POINT, BECAUSE I THINK

02:31:03.654 --> 02:31:04.955
THAT OFTEN TEN YEARS, I DON'T

02:31:05.022 --> 02:31:06.123
THINK THESE PANS GO WITHOUT

02:31:06.190 --> 02:31:07.458
BEING SCRATCHED. YOU SCRATCH IT.

02:31:07.525 --> 02:31:09.126
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO. I HAVEN'T

02:31:09.193 --> 02:31:10.628
SEEN THAT. FRANKLY, I'M NOT SURE

02:31:10.694 --> 02:31:12.029
WHICH WHICH WEBSITE IT IS.

02:31:12.096 --> 02:31:13.431
THAT'S WHAT I WOULD LOVE TO

02:31:13.497 --> 02:31:14.298
KNOW. THERE'S DOZENS OF

02:31:14.365 --> 02:31:16.000
COMPANIES IN THIS SPACE, BUT I

02:31:16.066 --> 02:31:17.201
WOULD. I WAS TOLD THAT'S WHEN

02:31:17.268 --> 02:31:19.336
THE HARM ARISES. I'VE SEEN THAT.

02:31:19.403 --> 02:31:20.438
SO I DON'T KNOW. BUT SCRATCH

02:31:20.504 --> 02:31:22.606
TEFLON IS SAFE. THE DEFINITION

02:31:22.673 --> 02:31:25.509
OF A MOLECULE OF PTFE IS IT WAS

02:31:25.576 --> 02:31:27.178
GOING TO PASS THROUGH THE HUMAN

02:31:27.244 --> 02:31:28.312
BODY. IT DOES NOT BIOACCUMULATE

02:31:28.379 --> 02:31:30.080
AND IT'S NOT WATER SOLUBLE. SO

02:31:30.147 --> 02:31:31.515
TECHNICALLY WOULD YOU TAKE A

02:31:31.582 --> 02:31:33.050
THIMBLEFUL OF TEFLON AND DRINK

02:31:33.117 --> 02:31:35.219
IT? YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO. BUT

02:31:35.286 --> 02:31:36.520
IF SOME OF IT DID GET SCRATCHED

02:31:36.587 --> 02:31:38.456
AND SOMEHOW INGESTED INTO YOUR

02:31:38.522 --> 02:31:40.558
BODY, STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT IT

02:31:40.624 --> 02:31:41.859
PASSES DIRECTLY THROUGH. IT DOES

02:31:41.926 --> 02:31:44.361
NOT BIND TO THE HUMAN BODY. THEY

02:31:44.428 --> 02:31:46.263
FORM MICROPLASTICS THAT CAN BE

02:31:46.330 --> 02:31:48.199
FOUND IN THE HUMAN BODY. THIS IS

02:31:48.265 --> 02:31:50.234
WHY WE HAVE FOUND THEM IN HUMAN

02:31:50.301 --> 02:31:52.470
SEMEN AND SPERM, AND THAT THERE

02:31:52.536 --> 02:31:54.004
IS AN ASSOCIATION WITH DECREASED

02:31:54.071 --> 02:31:57.007
SEMEN COUNTS. SO BUT I GUESS THE

02:31:57.074 --> 02:31:58.576
POINT THAT WAS MADE BY THE

02:31:58.642 --> 02:32:00.044
OPPOSITION THAT I WOULD LIKE YOU

02:32:00.110 --> 02:32:01.412
TO ADDRESS IS DO WE HAVE

02:32:01.479 --> 02:32:03.013
EVIDENCE THAT THE ALTERNATIVE,

02:32:03.080 --> 02:32:06.116
WHICH IS THE CERAMICS, IS SAFE?

02:32:06.183 --> 02:32:07.985
SO THAT'S ONE POSSIBLE

02:32:08.052 --> 02:32:08.986
ALTERNATIVE. WE ALSO HAVE, LIKE

02:32:09.053 --> 02:32:11.889
YOU SAID, STAINLESS STEEL AND

02:32:11.956 --> 02:32:14.658
CAST IRON. THANK YOU. I'M NOT AS

02:32:14.725 --> 02:32:16.160
FAMILIAR WITH THE RESEARCH RIGHT

02:32:16.227 --> 02:32:20.130
NOW ON THE CERAMIC COATED

02:32:20.197 --> 02:32:22.132
COATINGS. OKAY. I MEAN, IF WE

02:32:22.199 --> 02:32:23.834
ARE GOING TO DRIVE A MARKET

02:32:23.901 --> 02:32:24.502
TOWARDS CERAMICS, THAT'S

02:32:24.568 --> 02:32:26.036
CONCERNING FOR ME. IF WE DON'T

02:32:26.103 --> 02:32:28.138
KNOW THAT, THAT'S A SAFER

02:32:28.205 --> 02:32:28.873
ALTERNATIVE. AND I THINK IT IS

02:32:28.939 --> 02:32:30.407
SOMETHING THAT I WOULD ASK THE

02:32:30.474 --> 02:32:31.175
SENATOR TO LOOK INTO, BECAUSE

02:32:31.242 --> 02:32:33.944
THAT IS WOULD NOT PLEASE ME FOR

02:32:34.011 --> 02:32:35.412
DRIVING PEOPLE SOMETHING WE

02:32:35.479 --> 02:32:39.350
DON'T KNOW IS SAFE OR NOT. AS I

02:32:39.416 --> 02:32:41.485
SAID, I DID CAST IRON BECAUSE I

02:32:41.552 --> 02:32:42.786
DON'T KNOW. MY GRANDMA DID IT

02:32:42.853 --> 02:32:44.121
BACK IN THE DAY WHEN THINGS WERE

02:32:44.188 --> 02:32:45.923
ACTUALLY SAFE BEFORE TEFLON WAS

02:32:45.990 --> 02:32:47.558
EVEN IN THE MARKET. BUT BUT IT

02:32:47.625 --> 02:32:49.360
IS IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T JUST

02:32:49.426 --> 02:32:52.229
DRIVE CONSUMERS TO PRODUCTS THAT

02:32:52.296 --> 02:32:54.164
WE DON'T KNOW ARE SAFE OR NOT.

02:32:54.231 --> 02:32:56.033
AGAIN, WHICH IS WHAT WE DID WITH

02:32:56.100 --> 02:32:57.568
BPA, I THINK WAS REGRETTABLE. SO

02:32:57.635 --> 02:32:59.136
I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL

02:32:59.203 --> 02:33:00.971
TODAY. BUT I THINK TO ME THAT IS

02:33:01.038 --> 02:33:02.406
SORT OF THE OPEN QUESTION THAT

02:33:02.473 --> 02:33:04.308
REMAINS, WHICH IS ARE WE SAFER

02:33:04.375 --> 02:33:06.043
WITH THIS BAND? AND I THINK WHAT

02:33:06.110 --> 02:33:08.178
I'VE SEEN TO DATE TELLS ME, YES,

02:33:08.245 --> 02:33:09.613
BUT I THINK SOME IMPORTANT

02:33:09.680 --> 02:33:10.981
QUESTIONS WERE RAISED THAT IT IS

02:33:11.048 --> 02:33:12.583
INCUMBENT UPON US TO, TO SPEND

02:33:12.650 --> 02:33:13.951
SOME TIME LOOKING INTO. THANK

02:33:14.018 --> 02:33:16.987
YOU. AS A FOLLOW UP, IS IT FAIR

02:33:17.054 --> 02:33:20.190
TO SAY THAT EXTENDING TO 2030

02:33:20.257 --> 02:33:23.127
COULD HELP ESTABLISH

02:33:23.193 --> 02:33:25.663
ALTERNATIVES? I THINK THAT'S

02:33:25.729 --> 02:33:26.931
EXACTLY THAT'S THAT'S CERTAINLY

02:33:26.997 --> 02:33:28.699
PART OF THE IDEA, THE SPEED WITH

02:33:28.766 --> 02:33:30.367
WHICH TECHNOLOGY CONTINUES TO

02:33:30.434 --> 02:33:33.237
IMPROVE, IT'S ALLOWED FOR A LOT

02:33:33.304 --> 02:33:34.071
OF WONDERFUL PRODUCTS TO COME

02:33:34.138 --> 02:33:35.439
ONTO THE MARKET. AND I THINK

02:33:35.506 --> 02:33:37.274
THAT'S THE HOPE HERE THAT WE'LL

02:33:37.341 --> 02:33:39.677
BE ABLE TO GET SOME, SOME, SOME

02:33:39.743 --> 02:33:40.511
CLARITY. AND I THINK ALSO WE'LL

02:33:40.578 --> 02:33:42.212
GET MORE TESTING, RIGHT? I MEAN,

02:33:42.279 --> 02:33:44.114
I THINK, YOU KNOW, I KNOW ONE OF

02:33:44.181 --> 02:33:45.282
MY STAFFERS ACTUALLY HAS BEEN

02:33:45.349 --> 02:33:46.984
USING CERAMICS FOR MANY YEARS.

02:33:47.051 --> 02:33:49.086
AND SO THIS WHOLE IDEA THAT IT'S

02:33:49.153 --> 02:33:50.421
ONLY LASTS FOR ONE YEAR

02:33:50.487 --> 02:33:51.422
CERTAINLY DOESN'T CONFORM WITH

02:33:51.488 --> 02:33:52.690
HER PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. YOU

02:33:52.756 --> 02:33:54.625
KNOW, I ALSO WILL SAY WE WANT TO

02:33:54.692 --> 02:33:55.926
SPEND SOME TIME GETTING INTO THE

02:33:55.993 --> 02:33:57.761
DETAILS OF WHAT DRINKING A

02:33:57.828 --> 02:33:58.829
THIMBLE FULL OF TEFLON MIGHT,

02:33:58.896 --> 02:34:01.131
MIGHT, MIGHT DO TO YOUR BODY. OF

02:34:01.198 --> 02:34:02.266
COURSE, EVEN IF IT DOES PASS

02:34:02.333 --> 02:34:03.267
RIGHT THROUGH, I MEAN, IT'S

02:34:03.334 --> 02:34:05.302
GOING STRAIGHT INTO OUR WATER

02:34:05.369 --> 02:34:06.070
SYSTEM AND THEN HOLDING THESE

02:34:06.136 --> 02:34:08.105
POOR FOLKS ACCOUNTABLE. AND, YOU

02:34:08.172 --> 02:34:09.039
KNOW, WITH US ALL HAVING TO PAY

02:34:09.106 --> 02:34:10.841
THE COST TO GET IT OUT OF THE

02:34:10.908 --> 02:34:12.409
WATER. SO BUT YEAH, THIS IS

02:34:12.476 --> 02:34:13.911
TRICKY STUFF, RIGHT? AND WE KNOW

02:34:13.978 --> 02:34:15.045
THAT WE KNOW THERE'S A REAL

02:34:15.112 --> 02:34:16.947
PROBLEM ASSOCIATED WITH PFAS.

02:34:17.014 --> 02:34:18.215
AND HAVING MORE TIME WILL ALLOW

02:34:18.282 --> 02:34:20.050
US AND ALSO NOT ONLY ALLOW FOR

02:34:20.117 --> 02:34:21.251
MORE SCIENCE, MORE TECHNOLOGY,

02:34:21.318 --> 02:34:22.920
MORE INNOVATION, MORE STUDIES,

02:34:22.987 --> 02:34:25.122
AND ALSO FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

02:34:25.189 --> 02:34:26.857
ACT IN ONE DIRECTION OR ANOTHER

02:34:26.924 --> 02:34:29.426
BASED ON HOW THE SCIENCE MOVES.

02:34:29.493 --> 02:34:31.629
BUT YOU TO CLOSE. YEAH, I

02:34:31.695 --> 02:34:32.997
APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION VERY

02:34:33.063 --> 02:34:35.566
MUCH. IT'S AGAIN A TOUGH A TOUGH

02:34:35.633 --> 02:34:37.635
TOPIC. AND WE'RE CERTAINLY GOING

02:34:37.701 --> 02:34:40.070
TO BE ENGAGING OUR OUR THE FOLKS

02:34:40.137 --> 02:34:41.405
WHO'VE RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THE

02:34:41.472 --> 02:34:43.140
BILL OVER THE COURSE OF THE

02:34:43.207 --> 02:34:44.875
SUMMER TO SEE SEE WHAT MORE WE

02:34:44.942 --> 02:34:46.777
CAN, WE CAN FIGURE OUT HERE. WE

02:34:46.844 --> 02:34:48.779
KNOW WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH

02:34:48.846 --> 02:34:49.647
REGARDS TO PFAS. WE'VE ONLY

02:34:49.713 --> 02:34:51.482
WE'VE NOW LIMITED THE BILL TO

02:34:51.548 --> 02:34:53.751
THOSE PRODUCTS WHERE THERE ARE

02:34:53.817 --> 02:34:55.819
GOOD ALTERNATIVES. AND THAT'S,

02:34:55.886 --> 02:34:56.954
YOU KNOW, THAT THAT'S ULTIMATELY

02:34:57.021 --> 02:34:58.422
WHAT THE WHAT THE WHAT THE BILL

02:34:58.489 --> 02:35:00.724
IS ALL ABOUT. YOU KNOW, I

02:35:00.791 --> 02:35:02.059
THOUGHT THAT CERAMIC COATING WAS

02:35:02.126 --> 02:35:04.695
BASICALLY SAND AND WATER. SO I,

02:35:04.762 --> 02:35:07.031
YOU KNOW, MAYBE I'M IS THAT NOT

02:35:07.097 --> 02:35:08.365
NOT THE CASE. I KNOW I'M CLOSING

02:35:08.432 --> 02:35:10.167
HERE, BUT NO, NO. OKAY. ALL

02:35:10.234 --> 02:35:11.335
RIGHT. WELL LET'S GET INTO WE'LL

02:35:11.402 --> 02:35:13.103
TALK MORE ABOUT IT THIS WEEK.

02:35:13.170 --> 02:35:14.938
WE'LL GET TOGETHER AND TALK SOME

02:35:15.005 --> 02:35:15.973
MORE. BUT YOU KNOW, WHAT WE'RE

02:35:16.040 --> 02:35:17.875
TRYING TO DO HERE IS, IS

02:35:17.941 --> 02:35:18.742
BASICALLY SOURCE REDUCE THE

02:35:18.809 --> 02:35:19.643
AMOUNT OF THIS DANGEROUS

02:35:19.710 --> 02:35:21.011
CHEMICAL THAT'S OUT IN THE

02:35:21.078 --> 02:35:21.979
ENVIRONMENT. AND THAT'S THE

02:35:22.046 --> 02:35:23.180
BROAD GOAL HERE. THIS THIS IS

02:35:23.247 --> 02:35:24.982
NOT A MAGIC BULLET. THIS IS

02:35:25.049 --> 02:35:26.083
CERTAINLY NOWHERE NEAR AS

02:35:26.150 --> 02:35:27.451
COMPREHENSIVE AS THE BILL WAS

02:35:27.518 --> 02:35:29.219
WHEN WE FIRST GOT STARTED. BUT

02:35:29.286 --> 02:35:29.820
IT'S ULTIMATELY ABOUT MAKING

02:35:29.887 --> 02:35:31.021
SURE THAT, YOU KNOW, THE FOLKS

02:35:31.088 --> 02:35:33.090
WHO ARE TRYING TO MANAGE OUR OUR

02:35:33.157 --> 02:35:34.858
WATER SYSTEMS ARE GIVEN GIVEN A

02:35:34.925 --> 02:35:36.126
FIGHTING CHANCE TO COMPLY WITH

02:35:36.193 --> 02:35:39.763
THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS THAT

02:35:39.830 --> 02:35:41.098
THAT THAT THEY'RE REQUIRED TO

02:35:41.165 --> 02:35:42.499
COMPLY WITH SO AS TO ENSURE

02:35:42.566 --> 02:35:44.301
PUBLIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH.

02:35:44.368 --> 02:35:46.136
THAT'S WHY YOU SEE THEM ALL HERE

02:35:46.203 --> 02:35:48.172
ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS

02:35:48.238 --> 02:35:48.972
IMPORTANT MEASURE. AND I

02:35:49.039 --> 02:35:50.274
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. NO,

02:35:50.340 --> 02:35:52.543
I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON THIS.

02:35:52.609 --> 02:35:54.845
AS YOU NOTED, THIS COMMITTEE HAS

02:35:54.912 --> 02:35:57.581
DONE A LOT OF WORK ON PFAS.

02:35:57.648 --> 02:36:00.084
CERTAINLY CONTINUING THAT SPIRIT

02:36:00.150 --> 02:36:02.319
HERE, I DO APPRECIATE YOUR

02:36:02.386 --> 02:36:03.320
WILLINGNESS TO TAKE THE

THROW DOWN A MARKER. LASTLY, I

02:36:13.497 --> 02:36:16.400
BELIEVE THAT BASED ON WORK AND

02:36:16.467 --> 02:36:18.168
OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, WE

02:36:18.235 --> 02:36:21.839
SHOULD NOT BE EXEMPTING PTF AND

02:36:21.905 --> 02:36:24.975
SHOULD BE REGULATING PFAS AS A

02:36:25.042 --> 02:36:27.644
CLASS. WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO

02:36:27.711 --> 02:36:30.914
ONGOING DISCUSSIONS AROUND THAT.

02:36:30.981 --> 02:36:32.182
WITH THAT, I WILL BE

CONTAMINATION, AND PRENATAL

02:39:35.699 --> 02:39:38.235
VITAMINS. SINCE IT HAS ALREADY

YOU. HI. GOOD AFTERNOON, CHAIR

02:39:53.483 --> 02:39:54.885
AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I'M

02:39:54.952 --> 02:39:56.353
DOCTOR SARAH KIRSCHNER. I'M AN

02:39:56.420 --> 02:39:58.021
OB GYN WORKING HERE IN

02:39:58.088 --> 02:39:59.256
SACRAMENTO, AND I'M HERE TODAY

02:39:59.323 --> 02:40:00.924
ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN

02:40:00.991 --> 02:40:02.392
COLLEGE OF OBSTETRICIAN

02:40:02.459 --> 02:40:04.194
GYNECOLOGISTS, DISTRICT NINE, OR

02:40:04.261 --> 02:40:06.296
ACOG, IN STRONG SUPPORT OF OUR

02:40:06.363 --> 02:40:08.532
SPONSORED BILL, SB 646. THIS IS

02:40:08.598 --> 02:40:10.233
A CRITICAL MEASURE TO PROTECT

02:40:10.300 --> 02:40:12.135
MATERNAL AND FETAL HEALTH BY

02:40:12.202 --> 02:40:13.603
ENSURING TRANSPARENCY AND SAFETY

02:40:13.670 --> 02:40:15.572
IN PRENATAL VITAMINS. AS A

02:40:15.639 --> 02:40:16.840
PHYSICIAN, I ROUTINELY COUNSEL

02:40:16.907 --> 02:40:19.242
MY PATIENTS THE IMPORTANCE OF

02:40:19.309 --> 02:40:20.644
PRENATAL VITAMINS, WHICH ARE

02:40:20.711 --> 02:40:21.979
ESSENTIAL FOR FETAL DEVELOPMENT

02:40:22.045 --> 02:40:23.847
AND MATERNAL WELL-BEING. THESE

02:40:23.914 --> 02:40:25.148
VITAMINS PROVIDE KEY NUTRIENTS

02:40:25.215 --> 02:40:27.451
SUCH AS FOLIC ACID, IRON, AND

02:40:27.517 --> 02:40:28.852
OTHERS THAT HELP REDUCE THE RISK

02:40:28.919 --> 02:40:30.721
OF BIRTH DEFECTS, LOW BIRTH

02:40:30.787 --> 02:40:32.589
WEIGHT, AND PREGNANCY

02:40:32.656 --> 02:40:33.690
COMPLICATIONS. THEY ARE A

02:40:33.757 --> 02:40:35.726
CORNERSTONE OF PRENATAL CARE. I

02:40:35.792 --> 02:40:37.194
ALSO COUNSEL MY PREGNANT

02:40:37.260 --> 02:40:38.996
PATIENTS TO AVOID HIGH MERCURY

02:40:39.062 --> 02:40:41.198
FOODS LIKE TUNA, BUT

02:40:41.264 --> 02:40:42.566
UNFORTUNATELY THEY MAY BE

02:40:42.632 --> 02:40:44.101
INGESTING TOXIC ELEMENTS LIKE

02:40:44.167 --> 02:40:45.769
MERCURY IN THEIR PRENATAL

02:40:45.836 --> 02:40:47.704
VITAMINS. WHEN I MAKE

02:40:47.771 --> 02:40:49.072
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MY PATIENTS,

02:40:49.139 --> 02:40:51.641
I NEED TO BE CERTAIN THAT WHAT I

02:40:51.708 --> 02:40:52.209
ADVISE IS BOTH EFFECTIVE AND

02:40:52.275 --> 02:40:54.211
SAFE. IT'S A MATTER OF TRUST

02:40:54.277 --> 02:40:55.979
BETWEEN PHYSICIAN AND PATIENT.

02:40:56.046 --> 02:40:58.015
THAT'S WHY SB 646 IS SO

02:40:58.081 --> 02:40:59.816
IMPORTANT. RECENT STUDIES HAVE

02:40:59.883 --> 02:41:01.318
REVEALED A VERY TROUBLING

02:41:01.385 --> 02:41:03.320
REALITY TOXIC ELEMENTS INCLUDING

02:41:03.387 --> 02:41:05.222
LEAD, ARSENIC, CADMIUM AND

02:41:05.288 --> 02:41:06.790
MERCURY THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER

02:41:06.857 --> 02:41:08.458
HAVE BEEN FOUND IN PRENATAL

02:41:08.525 --> 02:41:10.360
VITAMINS. THESE ARE NOT

02:41:10.427 --> 02:41:11.695
NEGLIGIBLE CONTAMINANTS. EVEN

02:41:11.762 --> 02:41:13.030
LOW LEVEL EXPOSURE TO THESE

02:41:13.096 --> 02:41:14.297
HEAVY METALS CAN HARM A

02:41:14.364 --> 02:41:15.832
DEVELOPING FETUS AND INCREASE

02:41:15.899 --> 02:41:17.234
THE RISK OF COMPLICATIONS LIKE

02:41:17.300 --> 02:41:19.002
LOW BIRTH WEIGHT, PRETERM

02:41:19.069 --> 02:41:20.737
DELIVERY, AND NEURODEVELOPMENTAL

02:41:20.804 --> 02:41:23.073
DISORDERS. GIVEN THESE RISKS,

02:41:23.140 --> 02:41:24.975
BOTH PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS NEED

02:41:25.042 --> 02:41:26.877
TO HAVE ACCESS TO ACCURATE,

02:41:26.943 --> 02:41:28.311
TIMELY INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT IS

02:41:28.378 --> 02:41:30.514
IN THESE PRODUCTS BEFORE A

02:41:30.580 --> 02:41:31.948
RECOMMENDATION IS MADE OR A

02:41:32.015 --> 02:41:34.451
PURCHASE IS COMPLETED. SB 646 IS

02:41:34.518 --> 02:41:36.086
SIMPLE. IT DEMANDS TRANSPARENCY.

02:41:36.153 --> 02:41:37.421
IT REQUIRES MANUFACTURERS TO

02:41:37.487 --> 02:41:38.889
TEST THEIR PRODUCTS AND DISCLOSE

02:41:38.955 --> 02:41:40.323
THE RESULTS SO PEOPLE CAN MAKE

02:41:40.390 --> 02:41:43.093
SAFE AND INFORMED DECISIONS. WE

02:41:43.160 --> 02:41:44.728
CANNOT ALLOW THE VERY VITAMINS

02:41:44.795 --> 02:41:45.896
THAT ARE INTENDED TO PROTECT

02:41:45.962 --> 02:41:47.497
MATERNAL AND FETAL HEALTH TO

02:41:47.564 --> 02:41:49.266
BECOME A HIDDEN SOURCE OF HARM.

02:41:49.332 --> 02:41:51.334
SB 646 ENSURES THAT WHEN I

02:41:51.401 --> 02:41:52.669
RECOMMEND A PRENATAL VITAMIN, I

02:41:52.736 --> 02:41:54.237
CAN DO SO WITH THE CONFIDENCE

02:41:54.304 --> 02:41:55.972
THAT I AM TRULY HELPING AND NOT

02:41:56.039 --> 02:41:58.275
POTENTIALLY HARMING MY PATIENTS.

02:41:58.341 --> 02:41:59.676
FOR THESE REASONS, ACOG URGES

02:41:59.743 --> 02:42:01.945
YOUR SUPPORT OF SB 646 TO

02:42:02.012 --> 02:42:03.680
EMPOWER CONSUMERS AND PROTECT

02:42:03.747 --> 02:42:04.614
FUTURE GENERATIONS FROM

02:42:04.681 --> 02:42:06.917
PREVENTABLE, TOXIC EXPOSURES. I

02:42:06.983 --> 02:42:08.051
VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR TIME

02:42:08.118 --> 02:42:10.353
TODAY, AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER

02:42:10.420 --> 02:42:11.855
ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SO

02:42:11.922 --> 02:42:12.522
MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON, MR. CHAIR

WORKING GROUP, CO-SPONSORS SB

646. THIS BILL ADDRESSES A

02:42:17.928 --> 02:42:19.029
CRITICAL GAP IN CONSUMER

02:42:19.096 --> 02:42:20.931
PROTECTION BY REQUIRING GREATER

02:42:20.997 --> 02:42:21.598
TRANSPARENCY AROUND TOXIC

02:42:21.665 --> 02:42:23.400
ELEMENTS AND PRENATAL VITAMINS

02:42:23.467 --> 02:42:24.234
DESIGNED FOR PREGNANT

02:42:24.301 --> 02:42:25.535
INDIVIDUALS AND DEVELOPING

02:42:25.602 --> 02:42:26.603
BABIES. WE KNOW THAT THE

02:42:26.670 --> 02:42:28.071
EXPOSURE TO TOXIC HEAVY METALS

02:42:28.138 --> 02:42:29.840
LIKE LEAD AND CADMIUM CAN CAUSE

02:42:29.906 --> 02:42:30.574
LASTING HARM TO CHILDREN'S

02:42:30.640 --> 02:42:32.175
DEVELOPING NERVOUS SYSTEM

02:42:32.242 --> 02:42:33.477
NERVOUS SYSTEMS. MANY

02:42:33.543 --> 02:42:34.177
RESPONSIBLE MANUFACTURERS

02:42:34.244 --> 02:42:35.345
ALREADY TEST FOR THESE

02:42:35.412 --> 02:42:36.346
CONTAMINANTS. HOWEVER, WITHOUT

02:42:36.413 --> 02:42:37.914
CONSISTENT STANDARDS FOR

02:42:37.981 --> 02:42:39.249
DISCLOSURE, UNSAFE PRODUCTS

02:42:39.316 --> 02:42:40.016
REMAIN ON THE MARKET AND

02:42:40.083 --> 02:42:42.219
CONSUMERS ARE LEFT UNAWARE. SB

02:42:42.285 --> 02:42:43.720
646 FILLS THIS GAP BY PROVIDING

02:42:43.787 --> 02:42:45.422
CLEAR, ACCESSIBLE INFORMATION TO

02:42:45.489 --> 02:42:46.890
CONSUMERS AND THE HEALTH CARE

02:42:46.957 --> 02:42:48.191
PROVIDERS SO THAT PREGNANT

02:42:48.258 --> 02:42:50.060
INDIVIDUALS CAN UTILIZE THE BEST

02:42:50.127 --> 02:42:51.228
POSSIBLE CHOICES ABOUT WHAT THEY

02:42:51.294 --> 02:42:53.196
PUT IN THEIR BODIES. I'D LIKE TO

02:42:53.263 --> 02:42:54.865
EMPHASIZE THE FACT THAT WE'VE

02:42:54.931 --> 02:42:55.465
HAD SOME VERY GOOD DISCUSSIONS

02:42:55.532 --> 02:42:57.567
WITH THE OPPOSITION OVER THE

02:42:57.634 --> 02:43:00.070
CONCERNS THAT THEY HAD, THAT

02:43:00.137 --> 02:43:01.571
MANUFACTURERS WOULD DIMINISH THE

02:43:01.638 --> 02:43:03.306
QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT, OR

02:43:03.373 --> 02:43:04.774
PREGNANT INDIVIDUALS WOULD BE

02:43:04.841 --> 02:43:05.976
AFRAID TO TAKE PRENATAL

02:43:06.042 --> 02:43:07.711
VITAMINS. WITH THE HELP OF YOUR

02:43:07.777 --> 02:43:09.212
CONSULTANT, WE CAME UP WITH SOME

02:43:09.279 --> 02:43:10.213
VERY GOOD LANGUAGE WHICH WE

02:43:10.280 --> 02:43:11.781
THINK ADDRESSES THOSE CONCERNS,

02:43:11.848 --> 02:43:13.483
WHICH WE WOULD SAY MAYBE WERE A

02:43:13.550 --> 02:43:15.185
LITTLE OVEREMPHASIZED, BUT WE

02:43:15.252 --> 02:43:16.153
OBVIOUSLY THAT IS NOT THE INTENT

02:43:16.219 --> 02:43:18.855
OF THE BILL. THE INTENT OF THIS

02:43:18.922 --> 02:43:19.956
BILL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:43:20.023 --> 02:43:21.324
PREGNANT INDIVIDUALS KNOW WHAT

02:43:21.391 --> 02:43:22.325
THEY'RE BUYING AND KNOW WHAT

02:43:22.392 --> 02:43:23.960
THEY'RE PUTTING INTO THEIR BODY

02:43:24.027 --> 02:43:25.228
IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE. WE

02:43:25.295 --> 02:43:26.196
THANK THE DOCTOR FOR INTRODUCING

02:43:26.263 --> 02:43:27.264
THIS LEGISLATION. WE ASK FOR

02:43:27.330 --> 02:43:29.199
YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

02:43:29.266 --> 02:43:31.067
THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER

THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE ANYONE IN

02:44:04.568 --> 02:44:18.181

02:44:21.151 --> 02:44:22.619
OF THE COUNCIL FOR RESPONSIBLE

02:44:22.686 --> 02:44:23.920
NUTRITION AND AN OPPOSING LAST

02:44:23.987 --> 02:44:26.456
AMENDED POSITION. I APPRECIATE

02:44:26.523 --> 02:44:28.258
THE COMMENTS FROM THE SPONSORS.

02:44:28.325 --> 02:44:29.826
WE HAVE HAD SOME GOOD

02:44:29.893 --> 02:44:31.428
DISCUSSIONS. WE SUBMITTED A

02:44:31.494 --> 02:44:32.963
LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE THAT

02:44:33.029 --> 02:44:34.698
OUTLINES THE BASIS FOR OUR

02:44:34.764 --> 02:44:36.933
OPPOSITION. BUT I WILL JUST

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:38.969
FOCUS ON A COUPLE OF THINGS HERE

02:44:39.035 --> 02:44:40.904
TODAY, WHICH IS NUMBER ONE, WE

02:44:40.971 --> 02:44:43.440
HAVE NOT RAISED ANY CONCERN WITH

02:44:43.506 --> 02:44:45.909
THE IDEA OF TESTING PRENATAL

02:44:45.976 --> 02:44:48.445
VITAMIN PRODUCTS TO ENSURE THAT

02:44:48.511 --> 02:44:50.213
WE'RE TESTING FOR THE FOUR HEAVY

02:44:50.280 --> 02:44:52.048
METALS SPECIFIED IN THIS BILL.

02:44:52.115 --> 02:44:54.884
THE ISSUE HAS ALWAYS BEEN AROUND

02:44:54.951 --> 02:44:58.488
DISCLOSURE, AND WHILE DISCLOSURE

02:44:58.555 --> 02:44:59.956
OFTEN SOUNDS SIMPLE, WHICH IS

02:45:00.023 --> 02:45:01.391
YOU SHOULD SIMPLY DISCLOSE THE

02:45:01.458 --> 02:45:03.226
CONTENTS OF A PRODUCT, YOU NEED

02:45:03.293 --> 02:45:04.694
TO BE CAREFUL DEPENDING ON THE

02:45:04.761 --> 02:45:06.496
CONTEXT. PRENATAL VITAMINS WE

02:45:06.563 --> 02:45:08.632
ALL KNOW, ARE ABSOLUTELY

02:45:08.698 --> 02:45:10.400
CRITICAL FOR EXPECTANT MOTHERS

02:45:10.467 --> 02:45:12.269
TO TAKE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THEY

02:45:12.335 --> 02:45:14.371
CONTAIN HEAVY METALS. WE ALSO

02:45:14.437 --> 02:45:17.073
KNOW THAT THOSE HEAVY METALS ARE

02:45:17.140 --> 02:45:18.608
NATURALLY OCCURRING IN THE

02:45:18.675 --> 02:45:22.312
EARTH'S CRUST, AND DUE TO HUMAN

02:45:22.379 --> 02:45:25.482
ACTIVITY. SO WITH ALL OF THAT

02:45:25.548 --> 02:45:28.752
SAID, THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU

02:45:28.818 --> 02:45:30.654
DISCLOSE THIS INFORMATION TO

02:45:30.720 --> 02:45:32.455
EXPECTANT MOTHERS TO ENSURE THAT

02:45:32.522 --> 02:45:34.457
THEY ARE GETTING THE FULL

02:45:34.524 --> 02:45:37.394
CONTEXT AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE

02:45:37.460 --> 02:45:39.229
PRODUCT THAT THEY'RE TAKING,

02:45:39.296 --> 02:45:39.863
NOTWITHSTANDING THE PRESENCE OF

02:45:39.929 --> 02:45:42.032
HEAVY METALS, IS SAFE? WE'VE

02:45:42.098 --> 02:45:43.566
ALSO HAD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE

02:45:43.633 --> 02:45:45.268
FACT THAT OUR FOOD SUPPLY HAS

02:45:45.335 --> 02:45:48.405
HEAVY METALS. I OFTEN JOKE THAT

02:45:48.471 --> 02:45:50.073
I SPOIL EVERYBODY'S DINNER EVERY

02:45:50.140 --> 02:45:51.941
TIME I COME AND TESTIFY, BUT THE

02:45:52.008 --> 02:45:53.376
FACT OF THE MATTER IS LEAFY

02:45:53.443 --> 02:45:55.045
GREENS, SPINACH. THEY ALL HAVE

02:45:55.111 --> 02:45:57.580
HEAVY METALS, RIGHT? BUT WE ALL

02:45:57.647 --> 02:45:58.682
UNDERSTAND THAT EATING LEAFY

02:45:58.748 --> 02:46:00.483
GREENS IS A GOOD THING. WITH ALL

02:46:00.550 --> 02:46:02.919
THAT SAID, WE'VE HAD REALLY

02:46:02.986 --> 02:46:05.188
PRODUCTIVE BACK AND FORTH ON

02:46:05.255 --> 02:46:07.724
THIS. AND AS MR. SPENCER NOTED,

02:46:07.791 --> 02:46:09.793
I THINK THAT WE'VE WE'VE COME

02:46:09.859 --> 02:46:13.830
TO. TO WORK ON SOME DISCLOSURE

02:46:13.897 --> 02:46:15.598
LANGUAGE THAT MAKES SURE THAT

02:46:15.665 --> 02:46:17.801
THAT CONTEXT, ALBEIT, YOU KNOW,

02:46:17.867 --> 02:46:19.569
COMPLICATED IS PROVIDED, I

02:46:19.636 --> 02:46:22.072
THINK, IN A SIMPLEST OF TERMS

02:46:22.138 --> 02:46:24.240
AND AS DIGESTIBLE OF TERMS AS

02:46:24.307 --> 02:46:26.376
POSSIBLE. THERE CONTINUE TO BE A

02:46:26.443 --> 02:46:27.844
NUMBER OF OTHER ISSUES THAT

02:46:27.911 --> 02:46:28.945
WE'RE CONTINUING TO HAVE

02:46:29.012 --> 02:46:30.647
DISCUSSIONS WITH. BUT I REALLY

02:46:30.714 --> 02:46:32.549
WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR OF

YOU KNOW, I THINK WE APPRECIATE

02:46:57.674 --> 02:46:59.876
THE GOALS OF THIS BILL, BUT

02:46:59.943 --> 02:47:00.510
REMAIN CONCERNED THAT THE BILL

02:47:00.577 --> 02:47:01.244
COULD LIMIT NUTRIENTS THAT

02:47:01.311 --> 02:47:02.645
PREGNANT PEOPLE ARE GETTING BY

02:47:02.712 --> 02:47:04.214
CREATING CONFUSION IN THE

MARKETPLACE AND POTENTIALLY

02:47:05.315 --> 02:47:06.716
ENCOURAGING Kò NUTRIENTS BE LEFT

02:47:28.471 --> 02:47:29.739
CONSUMER FEDERATION OF

02:47:29.806 --> 02:47:30.840
CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. GREAT.

02:47:30.907 --> 02:47:33.143
THANK YOU. ANY OTHERS NOT SEEING

02:47:33.209 --> 02:47:35.245
ANY, WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK TO

02:47:35.311 --> 02:47:37.380
COMMITTEE MEMBERS WITH

02:47:37.447 --> 02:47:40.216
QUESTIONS. COMMENTS. VICE CHAIR.

02:47:40.283 --> 02:47:41.618
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. THANK

02:47:41.684 --> 02:47:45.288
YOU. SENATOR. I HAVE A COUPLE

02:47:45.355 --> 02:47:50.560
QUESTIONS FOR THE OPPOSITION. IF

02:47:50.627 --> 02:47:53.596
YOU KNOW THESE. I WAS LOOKING ON,

02:47:53.663 --> 02:47:54.297
I WAS ACTUALLY LOOKING ONLINE AT

02:47:54.364 --> 02:47:56.299
THE SOME OF THE CONSTITUENTS

02:47:56.366 --> 02:47:59.669
LEAD, MERCURY, CADMIUM, ARSENIC

02:47:59.736 --> 02:48:04.073
AND. AND IT SAID THAT, YOU KNOW,

02:48:04.140 --> 02:48:05.842
THERE WERE LIKE FIVE PPB PARTS

02:48:05.909 --> 02:48:09.012
PER BILLION OF THIS ONE AND TEN

02:48:09.078 --> 02:48:11.915
PPB, BUT IT DIDN'T GO INTO

02:48:11.981 --> 02:48:14.083
AGAIN, WHICH IS MORE STABLE AND

02:48:14.150 --> 02:48:15.885
WHICH ISN'T STABLE. SO FOR

02:48:15.952 --> 02:48:18.087
EXAMPLE, I THINK ARSENITES THE

02:48:18.154 --> 02:48:20.156
MOST IT COULD BE LABELED AS

02:48:20.223 --> 02:48:22.559
ARSENIC, BUT IT IS SUPER SOLUBLE

02:48:22.625 --> 02:48:24.427
AND SUPER DANGEROUS. BUT THEN

02:48:24.494 --> 02:48:28.798
THERE'S ARSENIDE, WHICH ISN'T.

02:48:28.865 --> 02:48:30.433
SO I KIND OF KIND OF GO BACK TO

02:48:30.500 --> 02:48:34.137
THE SCIENCE SIDE. IF WHAT IS THE

02:48:34.204 --> 02:48:36.039
TESTING THAT DETERMINES, YOU

02:48:36.105 --> 02:48:37.540
KNOW, WHICH IS WHICH IS REALLY

02:48:37.607 --> 02:48:40.176
BAD. AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION

02:48:40.243 --> 02:48:44.614
THAT I HAD, IF YOU GET YOUR

02:48:44.681 --> 02:48:47.817
METALS TO SUCH A LOW

02:48:47.884 --> 02:48:49.385
CONCENTRATION, ARE YOU ALSO

02:48:49.452 --> 02:48:51.888
TAKING AWAY THE CALCIUM AND

02:48:51.955 --> 02:48:53.056
MAGNESIUM AND THE MINERALS THAT

02:48:53.122 --> 02:48:56.159
ARE BENEFICIAL? YEAH, SURE. SO I

02:48:56.226 --> 02:48:57.727
WILL TAKE THE SECOND QUESTION

02:48:57.794 --> 02:48:59.062
FIRST AND THEN YOU CAN, YOU

02:48:59.128 --> 02:49:00.663
KNOW, ADD TO THE FIRST QUESTION,

02:49:00.730 --> 02:49:01.931
BECAUSE THAT IS BEEN SOMETHING

02:49:01.998 --> 02:49:03.766
THAT WE HAVE BEEN IN

02:49:03.833 --> 02:49:04.534
CONVERSATION ABOUT. AND LIKE I

02:49:04.601 --> 02:49:06.002
THINK EVERYONE UP HERE SAID

02:49:06.069 --> 02:49:07.670
WE'VE COME TO SOME LANGUAGE THAT

02:49:07.737 --> 02:49:11.274
HOPEFULLY ADDRESSES THAT CONCERN

02:49:11.341 --> 02:49:13.810
SINCE THERE ARE NATURAL TOXIC

02:49:13.877 --> 02:49:16.045
ELEMENTS. BUT THE QUESTION IS

02:49:16.112 --> 02:49:17.814
THERE ARE SOME PRODUCTS THAT

02:49:17.881 --> 02:49:19.749
DON'T HAVE THEM AND SOME OF THEM

02:49:19.816 --> 02:49:21.084
DON'T HAVE SOME OF THE OTHER

02:49:21.150 --> 02:49:22.819
ADDED NUTRIENTS THAT WE, AS

02:49:22.886 --> 02:49:25.421
OB-GYNS, WOULD RECOMMEND. THERE

02:49:25.488 --> 02:49:27.090
ARE SOME THAT SOURCE THEIR

02:49:27.156 --> 02:49:28.658
PRODUCTS FROM MUCH CLEANER

02:49:28.725 --> 02:49:30.693
PLACES AND ARE ABLE TO HAVE

02:49:30.760 --> 02:49:32.128
TOXIC ELEMENTS AT VERY LOW

02:49:32.195 --> 02:49:34.497
LEVELS, BUT STILL ARE ABLE TO

02:49:34.564 --> 02:49:36.165
HAVE THE FULL RANGE OF NUTRIENTS

02:49:36.232 --> 02:49:38.034
THAT WE, AS OB-GYNS, WOULD

02:49:38.101 --> 02:49:39.736
RECOMMEND. BUT WITH THE

02:49:39.802 --> 02:49:41.304
DISCLOSURE LABEL THAT THE

02:49:41.371 --> 02:49:43.039
LANGUAGE HAS BEEN WORKED OUT

02:49:43.106 --> 02:49:45.875
BETWEEN THE SPONSORS AND THE

02:49:45.942 --> 02:49:48.111
OPPOSITION, IT WOULD CLEARLY

02:49:48.177 --> 02:49:51.314
STATE THAT, YOU KNOW, SOME OF

02:49:51.381 --> 02:49:54.784
THOSE THAT ARE SOURCED FROM

02:49:54.851 --> 02:49:56.653
CLEANER SOURCES MAY NOT HAVE

02:49:56.719 --> 02:49:58.621
SOME OF THOSE NUTRIENTS, AND SO

02:49:58.688 --> 02:50:00.323
THEY MAY HAVE TO SUBSTITUTE WITH

02:50:00.390 --> 02:50:01.457
EITHER DIET OR OTHER

02:50:01.524 --> 02:50:02.792
SUPPLEMENTAL THINGS. THE POINT

02:50:02.859 --> 02:50:06.396
OF THIS BILL IS NOT TO DISSUADE

02:50:06.462 --> 02:50:08.164
INDIVIDUALS FROM USING PRENATAL

02:50:08.231 --> 02:50:10.400
VITAMINS. IT IS JUST TO PROVIDE

02:50:10.466 --> 02:50:13.236
MORE INFORMATION. AS AN OB GYN.

02:50:13.303 --> 02:50:14.938
AS A MOTHER OF TWO, I DIDN'T

02:50:15.004 --> 02:50:16.439
EVEN THINK ABOUT TOXIC ELEMENTS

02:50:16.506 --> 02:50:19.342
AND OR TOXIC CHEMICALS IN THE

02:50:19.409 --> 02:50:21.144
PRENATAL VITAMINS THAT I WAS

02:50:21.210 --> 02:50:22.712
TAKING THAT I WAS RECOMMENDING

02:50:22.779 --> 02:50:25.014
FOR MY PATIENTS TO TAKE UNTIL

02:50:25.081 --> 02:50:26.516
STARTED LOOKING INTO THIS BILL.

02:50:26.583 --> 02:50:28.484
AND SO IT REALLY IS ABOUT

02:50:28.551 --> 02:50:29.786
DISCLOSURE TO ALLOW THE

02:50:29.852 --> 02:50:31.220
INDIVIDUAL AND THEIR PROVIDER TO

02:50:31.287 --> 02:50:32.589
HELP MAKE THE BEST CHOICE

02:50:32.655 --> 02:50:34.357
POSSIBLE FOR THEM. BUT I'LL LET

02:50:34.424 --> 02:50:35.491
YOU ANSWER THE FIRST QUESTION.

02:50:35.558 --> 02:50:38.127
THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE EASY

02:50:38.194 --> 02:50:38.761
ONE. OH YOU'RE WELCOME. WHAT

02:50:38.828 --> 02:50:39.929
I'VE LEARNED, WHAT I'VE LEARNED

02:50:39.996 --> 02:50:42.031
VERY QUICKLY IN OBSERVING THE

02:50:42.098 --> 02:50:43.533
PREVIOUS BILL, MR. ELLIS. AND

02:50:43.600 --> 02:50:46.202
NOW THIS ONE IS THAT I NEED TO

02:50:46.269 --> 02:50:47.103
BRING A SCIENTIST WITH ME THE

02:50:47.170 --> 02:50:49.272
NEXT TIME I TESTIFY. IT'S A GOOD

02:50:49.339 --> 02:50:50.640
QUESTION. I DON'T KNOW THE

02:50:50.707 --> 02:50:52.075
ANSWER. I DON'T LIKE RESPONDING

02:50:52.141 --> 02:50:54.277
WHEN I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER, SO

02:50:54.344 --> 02:50:57.146
I WILL. I CAN CERTAINLY GET THAT

02:50:57.213 --> 02:50:58.915
INFORMATION FOR YOU AND GET

02:50:58.982 --> 02:51:00.817
BACK. AS TO THE SECOND QUESTION,

02:51:00.883 --> 02:51:02.619
I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, THE

02:51:02.685 --> 02:51:04.354
SENATOR WAS SPOT ON. WE ARE NOT

02:51:04.420 --> 02:51:06.556
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO MESS WITH

02:51:06.623 --> 02:51:08.291
THE MARKETPLACE HERE. PEOPLE

02:51:08.358 --> 02:51:10.293
CAN, CAN, CAN CHOOSE TO PUT WHAT

02:51:10.360 --> 02:51:11.661
THEY WISH AND PRENATAL VITAMINS

02:51:11.728 --> 02:51:13.463
AND MARK THEM AS THEY PLEASE.

02:51:13.529 --> 02:51:16.933
OUR CONCERN IS, IS THE IDEA THAT

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.902
IF A PRENATAL VITAMIN, FOR

02:51:19.969 --> 02:51:21.571
EXAMPLE, DOESN'T HAVE ANY

02:51:21.638 --> 02:51:23.039
CALCIUM, LET'S JUST TAKE TWO

02:51:23.106 --> 02:51:25.408
PRENATAL VITAMINS SOURCE FROM

02:51:25.475 --> 02:51:29.412
THE SAME EXACT PLACE. ALL RIGHT?

02:51:29.479 --> 02:51:30.413
ONE ONE INCLUDES CALCIUM, THE

02:51:30.480 --> 02:51:32.081
OTHER DOES NOT. THE ONE WITH

02:51:32.148 --> 02:51:33.516
CALCIUM IS GOING TO HAVE MORE

02:51:33.583 --> 02:51:36.486
LEAD IN IT. RIGHT. BECAUSE LEAD

02:51:36.552 --> 02:51:38.121
IS NATURALLY OCCURRING CALCIUM.

02:51:38.187 --> 02:51:41.257
THAT'S FINE. WE NEED TO MAKE

02:51:41.324 --> 02:51:42.725
SURE THERE'S A DISCLOSURE FOR

02:51:42.792 --> 02:51:43.993
PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT IF

02:51:44.060 --> 02:51:46.929
THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE A PRENATAL

02:51:46.996 --> 02:51:48.665
VITAMIN THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY

02:51:48.731 --> 02:51:50.033
CALCIUM, THAT IT MAY VERY WELL

02:51:50.099 --> 02:51:52.268
BE THAT THE HEAVY METAL LEVELS

02:51:52.335 --> 02:51:54.771
WILL BE LOWER. THEY WILL ALSO

02:51:54.837 --> 02:51:56.205
UNDERSTAND THAT IF THEY WERE TO

02:51:56.272 --> 02:51:57.640
GO GET THE CALCIUM THROUGH

02:51:57.707 --> 02:51:59.142
EATING SOMETHING LIKE SPINACH,

02:51:59.208 --> 02:52:00.877
THEY MAY ALSO BE EXPOSED TO

02:52:00.943 --> 02:52:02.679
HEAVY METALS. SO IT'S JUST AN

02:52:02.745 --> 02:52:03.379
AWARENESS ISSUE. AND I THINK

02:52:03.446 --> 02:52:05.214
WE'VE AGAIN, IT ALL CAME DOWN TO

02:52:05.281 --> 02:52:07.717
THE DISCLOSURE. AND IT TOOK SOME

02:52:07.784 --> 02:52:09.185
TIME TO GET THERE BECAUSE

02:52:09.252 --> 02:52:10.253
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT OF

02:52:10.319 --> 02:52:11.254
THINGS THAT WE'RE BALANCING

02:52:11.320 --> 02:52:14.991
HERE. BUT I THINK THIS IS

02:52:15.058 --> 02:52:17.093
PROBABLY AS AS AS GOOD OF A

02:52:17.160 --> 02:52:18.928
DISCLOSURE AS I THINK WE CAN GET

02:52:18.995 --> 02:52:23.099
GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCE. THANK

02:52:23.166 --> 02:52:26.035
YOU. I THINK YOU'LL GET THERE ON

02:52:26.102 --> 02:52:30.339
THE DISCLOSURE. SO I'M READY.

02:52:30.406 --> 02:52:32.275
THAT WAS MY QUESTION TOO. SO IT

02:52:32.341 --> 02:52:35.178
SOUNDS LIKE VERY CLOSE. YEAH.

02:52:35.244 --> 02:52:37.280
JUST TO BE CLEAR, WE'VE WE'VE

02:52:37.346 --> 02:52:38.681
WORKED ON DISCLOSURE LANGUAGE

02:52:38.748 --> 02:52:40.516
THAT WILL WILL BE IN PRINT. AND

02:52:40.583 --> 02:52:42.251
WE HAVE ALL THERE CONTINUE TO BE

02:52:42.318 --> 02:52:44.921
SOME ISSUES WE WILL WILL WORK

02:52:44.987 --> 02:52:46.189
OUT. BUT I THINK AS FOR THE

02:52:46.255 --> 02:52:49.492
DISCLOSURE LANGUAGE, I THINK IT

02:52:49.559 --> 02:52:50.326
ADDRESSES ALL THE ISSUES THAT

02:52:50.393 --> 02:52:52.929
WE'VE DISCUSSED. YEAH, GREAT.

02:52:52.995 --> 02:52:55.665
GOOD JOB. SENATOR, WOULD YOU

02:52:55.732 --> 02:52:58.434
LIKE TO CLOSE JUST RESPECTFULLY

02:52:58.501 --> 02:53:00.069
ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON SB 646.

02:53:00.136 --> 02:53:01.204
THANK YOU. GREAT. APPRECIATE

02:53:01.270 --> 02:53:05.141

IT'S GOOD I WAS. YEAH, I WAS

REALLY WORRIED HERE OUT OF

02:54:09.806 --> 02:54:10.907
CURIOSITY BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO

02:54:10.973 --> 02:54:13.743
LEARN, I KNOW I SLIGHTLY HAD TO,

02:54:13.810 --> 02:54:17.180
I KNOW IT'S THAT TIME. I WOULD

02:54:17.246 --> 02:54:19.348
HAVE ASKED MORE QUESTIONS.

02:54:19.415 --> 02:54:21.717

YOU'RE FINE IF YOU'RE USING. BUT
