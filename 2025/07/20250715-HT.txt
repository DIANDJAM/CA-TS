00:44:44.048 --> 00:44:48.052
ORDER OF BUSINESS WITH SENATOR

00:45:24.822 --> 00:45:26.523
HARD COPIES HERE FOR YOU. ONE IS

AMENDMENTS, AND THE OTHER IS A

00:45:30.561 --> 00:45:34.298
MOCK UP FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.

00:45:34.364 --> 00:45:37.768
WITH THAT. WE WILL BEGIN WITH

00:45:37.835 --> 00:45:40.637
OUR SPECIAL ORDER OF BUSINESS,

00:45:40.704 --> 00:45:44.842
SB 306 BY SENATOR BECKER.

00:45:44.908 --> 00:45:49.446
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY, SENATOR.

00:45:49.513 --> 00:45:52.749
THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR. SENATE

00:45:52.816 --> 00:45:54.985
BILL 306 ADDRESSES A KEY BARRIER

00:45:55.052 --> 00:45:57.454
TO TIMELY CARE A NECESSARY PRIOR

00:45:57.521 --> 00:45:58.856
AUTHORIZATION WITH THE CHAIR AND

00:45:58.922 --> 00:46:00.057
COMMITTEE'S APPROVAL. I'M

00:46:00.124 --> 00:46:01.925
OFFERING AMENDMENTS TODAY, WHICH

00:46:01.992 --> 00:46:04.394
YOUR COMMITTEE HAS ANALYZED.

00:46:04.461 --> 00:46:05.429
HOWEVER, BEFORE I SUMMARIZE

00:46:05.496 --> 00:46:06.630
AMENDMENTS, LET ME TAKE A MOMENT

00:46:06.697 --> 00:46:08.966
TO TELL YOU WHY THIS IS AN

00:46:09.032 --> 00:46:10.067
IMPORTANT BILL. DOCTORS ARE

00:46:10.134 --> 00:46:12.703
SPENDING MORE TIME ON PAPERWORK

00:46:12.769 --> 00:46:14.438
THAN WITH THEIR PATIENTS. IN

00:46:14.505 --> 00:46:17.674
MANY CASES, A 2023 AMA SURVEY

00:46:17.741 --> 00:46:19.543
FOUND PHYSICIANS COMPLETE 43

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:22.079
PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS PER WEEK,

00:46:22.146 --> 00:46:23.447
SPENT AN AVERAGE OF 12 HOURS

00:46:23.514 --> 00:46:25.482
JUST ON THAT. THIS RED TAPE IS

00:46:25.549 --> 00:46:26.550
PREVENTING DOCTORS FROM DOING

00:46:26.617 --> 00:46:28.085
WHAT THEY ARE TRAINED TO DO,

00:46:28.152 --> 00:46:30.521
WHICH IS TREAT PATIENTS. PRIOR

00:46:30.587 --> 00:46:32.856
AUTHORIZATION DELAYS CARE. 94%

00:46:32.923 --> 00:46:34.358
OF DOCTORS SAY IT CAUSES

00:46:34.424 --> 00:46:36.393
TREATMENT DELAYS AND THERE ARE

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:38.128
MINOR. THE SAME SURVEY FOUND

00:46:38.195 --> 00:46:39.897
THAT 19% OF DOCTORS SAID A

00:46:39.963 --> 00:46:41.331
PATIENT WAS HOSPITALIZED BECAUSE

00:46:41.398 --> 00:46:44.168
OF THESE DELAYS, AND 13% SAID

00:46:44.234 --> 00:46:45.469
PATIENTS EXPERIENCED A LIFE

00:46:45.536 --> 00:46:46.570
THREATENING EVENT OR NEEDED

00:46:46.637 --> 00:46:48.572
URGENT INTERVENTION. AND THE

00:46:48.639 --> 00:46:49.773
WORST PART? MANY OF THESE

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:51.041
REQUESTS ARE ALMOST ALWAYS

00:46:51.108 --> 00:46:53.277
APPROVED JUST DAYS OR WEEKS OF

00:46:53.343 --> 00:46:55.679
WAITING. RIGHT NOW, INSURERS AND

00:46:55.746 --> 00:46:57.281
HEALTH PLANS CAN REQUIRE PRIOR

00:46:57.347 --> 00:46:58.015
AUTHORIZATION TO DETERMINE IF

00:46:58.081 --> 00:46:59.750
CARE RECOMMENDED BY A PHYSICIAN

00:46:59.816 --> 00:47:01.985
OR OTHER LICENSED PROVIDER IS

00:47:02.052 --> 00:47:03.253
MEDICALLY NECESSARY, BUT THAT

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:04.988
DOESN'T STOP THEM FROM REQUIRING

00:47:05.055 --> 00:47:07.024
APPROVAL FOR ROUTINE, COMMONLY

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:08.258
APPROVED CARE. AS IT HAPPENED

00:47:08.325 --> 00:47:09.893
WITH A MEMBER OF MY TEAM

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:10.994
RECENTLY, THE ISSUE OF PRIOR

00:47:11.061 --> 00:47:12.596
APPROVAL AND ITS POTENTIAL TO

00:47:12.663 --> 00:47:13.897
DELAY NECESSARY CARE AND REDUCE

00:47:13.964 --> 00:47:15.732
COSTS IS ONE I'VE WORKED FOR

00:47:15.799 --> 00:47:17.634
SEVERAL YEARS NOW. LAST YEAR, I

00:47:17.701 --> 00:47:19.870
AUTHORED SB 1120, KNOWN AS

00:47:19.937 --> 00:47:21.038
PHYSICIANS MAKE DECISIONS BILL,

00:47:21.104 --> 00:47:22.472
WHICH ESTABLISHES A REQUIREMENT

00:47:22.539 --> 00:47:24.241
FOR HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS

00:47:24.308 --> 00:47:25.609
APPLICABLE FOR THE USE OF

00:47:25.676 --> 00:47:26.810
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR

00:47:26.877 --> 00:47:28.512
UTILIZATION REVIEW DECISIONS.

00:47:28.579 --> 00:47:30.714
THIS YEAR, MY GOAL FOR SB 306 IS

00:47:30.781 --> 00:47:31.982
TO FREE UP TIME FOR PROVIDERS TO

00:47:32.049 --> 00:47:33.951
FOCUS ON PATIENT CARE, REDUCE

00:47:34.017 --> 00:47:35.752
DELAYS IN TREATMENT, ALLOW

00:47:35.819 --> 00:47:36.853
HEALTH PLANS TO CONCENTRATE THE

00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:38.121
REVIEW PROCESS WHERE THEY'RE

00:47:38.188 --> 00:47:39.623
ACTUALLY NEEDED. AND JUST

00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:41.925
OVERALL, WE WANT TO REDUCE THE

00:47:41.992 --> 00:47:44.161
TIME AND MONEY SPENT IN OUR US

00:47:44.228 --> 00:47:45.495
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, WHICH IS THE

00:47:45.562 --> 00:47:47.331
ONLY ONE THAT REALLY HAS THIS

00:47:47.397 --> 00:47:48.332
CONVOLUTED PROCESS. REDUCE THE

00:47:48.398 --> 00:47:53.070
TIME SPENT ON PAPERWORK AND

00:47:53.136 --> 00:47:54.838
PRIOR AUTHORIZATION

00:47:54.905 --> 00:47:57.708
DELIBERATIONS. MORE TIME SPENT

00:47:57.774 --> 00:47:59.676
FOR MORE MONEY AND MORE TIME

00:47:59.743 --> 00:48:01.712
SPENT FOR PROVIDERS WITH

00:48:01.778 --> 00:48:03.714
PATIENTS. LAST WEDNESDAY NIGHT,

00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:05.215
DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH

00:48:05.282 --> 00:48:06.717
CARE DMHC SENT US AMENDMENTS

00:48:06.783 --> 00:48:07.951
WHICH REWRITE THE BILL. THAT'S

00:48:08.018 --> 00:48:11.154
IN PRINT. YOU CAN IMAGINE MY

00:48:11.221 --> 00:48:13.090
DISMAY AND FRUSTRATION THAT THEY

00:48:13.156 --> 00:48:15.025
WOULD OFFER SUCH EXTENSIVE

00:48:15.092 --> 00:48:16.393
CHANGES THIS LATE IN THE

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:18.228
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. AND

00:48:18.295 --> 00:48:19.796
NONETHELESS, MY BILL, THE BILL

00:48:19.863 --> 00:48:20.831
SPONSOR AND THE COMMITTEE

00:48:20.897 --> 00:48:22.599
CONSULTANTS REVIEWED THE

00:48:22.666 --> 00:48:23.734
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO SEE

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:25.202
IF IT ACCOMPLISHES THE INTENT OF

00:48:25.269 --> 00:48:27.304
SB 306 AND IF CONCLUDED THAT

00:48:27.371 --> 00:48:29.072
WITH SOME SOME MODIFICATIONS.

00:48:29.139 --> 00:48:30.507
THE AMENDMENTS ARE CONSISTENT

00:48:30.574 --> 00:48:31.942
WITH THE ORIGINAL BILL'S GOAL,

00:48:32.009 --> 00:48:33.777
BUT ARRIVES THERE IN A DIFFERENT

00:48:33.844 --> 00:48:35.112
MANNER. WELL, THE BILL IN PRINT

00:48:35.178 --> 00:48:36.513
PROHIBITS AN INSURER OR HEALTH

00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:37.681
PLAN FROM REQUIRING PRIOR

00:48:37.748 --> 00:48:39.049
AUTHORIZATION FOR SERVICES AND

00:48:39.116 --> 00:48:40.584
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. IF IT HAD

00:48:40.651 --> 00:48:43.086
BEEN APPROVED 90% OR MORE OF THE

00:48:43.153 --> 00:48:44.955
TIME. THE AMENDED VERSION WILL

00:48:45.022 --> 00:48:47.024
INSTEAD LARGELY SEE THE

00:48:47.090 --> 00:48:47.758
DETERMINATION OF SERVICES AND

00:48:47.824 --> 00:48:49.893
DRUGS EXEMPTED FROM PRIOR

00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:51.695
AUTHORIZATIONS TO DMHC AND CDI,

00:48:51.762 --> 00:48:53.964
WITH SOME GUIDING FACTORS. THE

00:48:54.031 --> 00:48:56.066
AMENDMENTS WOULD REQUIRE DMHC

00:48:56.133 --> 00:48:58.201
AND CDI TO REQUEST A RANGE OF

00:48:58.268 --> 00:48:59.636
UTILIZATION DATA FROM PLANS AND

00:48:59.703 --> 00:49:01.672
INSURERS, AND BASED ON THAT DATA

00:49:01.738 --> 00:49:02.773
AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH GUIDANCE

00:49:02.839 --> 00:49:04.374
SET FORTH IN THE BILL, INSTRUCT

00:49:04.441 --> 00:49:06.777

00:49:06.843 --> 00:49:08.578
SHOULD BE EXEMPT FROM PRIOR

00:49:08.645 --> 00:49:09.646
AUTHORIZATION. THE BILL

00:49:09.713 --> 00:49:11.515
SPECIFICALLY REQUIRES DMHC AND

00:49:11.581 --> 00:49:13.283
CDI TO CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL

00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:16.086

00:49:16.153 --> 00:49:18.422
PATIENT HARM WHEN ORDERING

00:49:18.488 --> 00:49:20.891
EXEMPTIONS FROM PRIOR APPROVAL.

00:49:20.957 --> 00:49:21.692
THE BILL PERMITS HEALTH PLANS,

00:49:21.758 --> 00:49:23.794
INSURERS TO PETITION DMHC AND

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:25.529
CDI TO REINSTATE AN EXEMPTED

00:49:25.595 --> 00:49:27.297

APPROVAL IF THEY CAN DEMONSTRATE

00:49:29.499 --> 00:49:31.201
EXEMPTION THAT HAS RESULTED IN

00:49:31.268 --> 00:49:33.804
INCREASE IN COSTS OR DECREASE IN

00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:35.605
QUALITY OF CARE. FINALLY, THE

00:49:35.672 --> 00:49:36.873

ACCEPTS THESE AMENDMENTS, WE CAN

00:49:45.782 --> 00:49:47.884
CUT RED TAPE FOR PROVIDERS,

00:49:47.951 --> 00:49:49.386
REDUCE UNNECESSARY DELAYS FOR

00:49:49.453 --> 00:49:50.821
PATIENTS, PROTECT PATIENT

00:49:50.887 --> 00:49:52.656

UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT WHEN

00:49:56.159 --> 00:49:57.627
APPROPRIATE. THE BILL IS BROAD

00:50:25.856 --> 00:50:27.791
WE'RE THE PROUD SPONSORS OF SB

00:50:27.858 --> 00:50:29.926
COR 306 BY SENATOR BECKER. WE'D

00:50:29.993 --> 00:50:31.795
LIKE TO THANK SENATOR BECKER FOR

00:50:31.862 --> 00:50:33.430
AUTHORING THIS CRITICAL MEASURE

00:50:33.497 --> 00:50:35.432
IN OUR PRIOR AUTHORIZATION

00:50:35.499 --> 00:50:37.467
REFORM LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE. WE

00:50:37.534 --> 00:50:38.869
ALSO WANT TO THANK CHAIR BONTA

00:50:38.935 --> 00:50:41.037
AND HER STAFF FOR THEIR

00:50:41.104 --> 00:50:42.606
COUNTLESS HOURS OF WORK ON THIS

00:50:42.672 --> 00:50:44.341
LEGISLATION. THIS IS NOT A NEW

00:50:44.408 --> 00:50:45.542
ISSUE IN HEALTHCARE OR FOR THIS

00:50:45.609 --> 00:50:46.810
COMMITTEE, BUT CALIFORNIA

00:50:46.877 --> 00:50:48.612
PATIENTS AND PHYSICIANS NEED

00:50:48.678 --> 00:50:51.214
PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REFORM NOW

00:50:51.281 --> 00:50:53.049
MORE THAN EVER WITH THE PROPOSED

00:50:53.116 --> 00:50:54.151
AMENDMENTS, THIS BILL STILL

00:50:54.217 --> 00:50:55.585
OFFERS A STRAIGHTFORWARD

00:50:55.652 --> 00:50:57.587
APPROACH THAT WILL ALLOW THE

00:50:57.654 --> 00:50:59.055
DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH

00:50:59.122 --> 00:51:00.090
CARE TO REMOVE PRIOR

00:51:00.157 --> 00:51:01.658
AUTHORIZATION FROM NUMEROUS

00:51:01.725 --> 00:51:04.327
SERVICES AND SOME PRESCRIPTION

00:51:04.394 --> 00:51:05.662
MEDICATIONS THAT ARE APPROVED

00:51:05.729 --> 00:51:07.731
FOR 90% OR MORE OF THE REQUESTS.

00:51:07.798 --> 00:51:10.233
THE PRIOR CALENDAR YEAR. PRIOR

00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:11.468
AUTHORIZATION WAS INTENDED TO

00:51:11.535 --> 00:51:12.836
ENSURE APPROPRIATE USE OF

00:51:12.903 --> 00:51:14.571
SERVICES AND THEREFORE CONTROL

00:51:14.638 --> 00:51:17.073
HEALTHCARE COSTS. IT'S BECOME

00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:18.175
INCREASINGLY AN ADMINISTRATIVE

00:51:18.241 --> 00:51:19.543
ROADBLOCK THAT DELAYS NECESSARY

00:51:19.609 --> 00:51:22.112
CARE, INCREASES PHYSICIAN

00:51:22.179 --> 00:51:23.313
ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN, AND

00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:26.216
FRUSTRATES PATIENTS. THE CURRENT

00:51:26.283 --> 00:51:27.651
PROCESS PRIORITIZES HEALTH CARE,

00:51:27.717 --> 00:51:29.052
HEALTH PLAN PROFITS OVER PATIENT

00:51:29.119 --> 00:51:30.821
CARE. PHYSICIANS ROUTINELY SPEND

00:51:30.887 --> 00:51:32.889
HOURS, SOMETIMES DAYS,

00:51:32.956 --> 00:51:36.293
NAVIGATING COMPLEX, INCONSISTENT

00:51:36.359 --> 00:51:37.727
AUTHORIZATION REQUIREMENTS THAT

00:51:37.794 --> 00:51:39.763
OFTEN OVERRIDE ACTUAL CLINICAL

00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:41.965
JUDGMENT WHILE NOT REDUCING

00:51:42.032 --> 00:51:43.934
COSTS. WE ARE NOT SUGGESTING

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:44.868
PRIOR AUTHORIZATION IS NOT

00:51:44.935 --> 00:51:45.936
APPROPRIATE IN SOME

00:51:46.002 --> 00:51:47.103
CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT THE CURRENT

00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:49.573
SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE DRASTICALLY

00:51:49.639 --> 00:51:52.476
OVERHAULED. THE TIME SPENT ON

00:51:52.542 --> 00:51:53.443
INEFFICIENT AND BURDENSOME TASKS

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:55.445
COMES AT THE EXPENSE OF

00:51:55.512 --> 00:51:57.180
PATIENTS. BY REDUCING THE TIME

00:51:57.247 --> 00:51:58.014
PATIENTS SPEND WITH PATIENTS IN

00:51:58.081 --> 00:52:00.217
THE EXAMINING ROOM, COORDINATING

00:52:00.283 --> 00:52:02.886
CARE FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC

00:52:02.953 --> 00:52:04.321
DISEASES, AND INCREASING ACCESS

00:52:04.387 --> 00:52:06.056
TO CARE FOR NEW PATIENTS. WE

00:52:06.122 --> 00:52:08.592
NEED TO PLACE PATIENTS AHEAD OF

00:52:08.658 --> 00:52:10.427
PAPERWORK. FOR PHYSICIANS. PRIOR

00:52:10.494 --> 00:52:11.561
AUTHORIZATION HAS BEEN, AND

00:52:11.628 --> 00:52:13.230
REMAINS A MAJOR SOURCE OF

00:52:13.296 --> 00:52:14.331
DISSATISFACTION IN CLINICAL

00:52:14.397 --> 00:52:16.199
PRACTICE. I CAN TELL YOU, I'VE

00:52:16.266 --> 00:52:17.567
SPENT COUNTLESS HOURS OVER THE

00:52:17.634 --> 00:52:19.769
COURSE OF MY CAREER SUBMITTING

00:52:19.836 --> 00:52:20.770
THE NEEDED INFORMATION FOR PRIOR

00:52:20.837 --> 00:52:23.106
AUTH TO THEN RECEIVE THE REPLY

00:52:23.173 --> 00:52:24.841
TO THE REQUEST DAYS OR EVEN

00:52:24.908 --> 00:52:26.743
WEEKS LATER. THE TOLL ON

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:28.144
PATIENTS IS TREMENDOUS AND CAN

00:52:28.211 --> 00:52:29.846
EVEN BE DANGEROUS. THE PRIOR

00:52:29.913 --> 00:52:31.815
AUTHORIZATION PROCESS IS A TIME

00:52:31.882 --> 00:52:32.649
CONSUMING BARRIER TO NECESSARY

00:52:32.716 --> 00:52:35.619
PATIENT CARE. IN CLOSING,

00:52:35.685 --> 00:52:36.820
PATIENTS AND PHYSICIANS ARE

00:52:36.887 --> 00:52:38.188
BURDENED BY UNNECESSARY PRIOR

00:52:38.255 --> 00:52:39.322
AUTHORIZATION REQUESTS FOR

SERVICES THAT ARE ROUTINELY

00:52:40.724 --> 00:52:43.226
APPROVED AT HIGH RATES. IN MANY

00:52:43.293 --> 00:52:44.661
CASES, THESE SERVICES ARE

00:52:44.728 --> 00:52:46.396
ROUTINE OR RECURRING, YET STILL

00:52:46.463 --> 00:52:48.265
CRITICAL TO BE PROVIDED IN A

00:52:48.331 --> 00:52:50.467
TIMELY MANNER TO PATIENTS. THE

HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, AND THIS

00:52:55.872 --> 00:52:57.541
BILL WILL DIRECTLY ADDRESS THIS

00:52:57.607 --> 00:52:58.742
ISSUE. FOR THOSE REASONS, WE

00:52:58.808 --> 00:53:00.343
URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS

00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:01.912
CRITICAL REFORM TO THE PRIOR

AUTHORIZATION SYSTEM THAT WILL

00:53:02.812 --> 00:53:05.181
RESULT IN GREATER ACCESS AND

00:53:05.248 --> 00:53:07.384

RECOGNIZING THAT SEVERAL

00:57:23.072 --> 00:57:24.774
AMENDMENTS ARE GOING INTO IT

00:57:24.841 --> 00:57:26.075
TODAY. BUT JUST, YOU KNOW,

00:57:26.142 --> 00:57:27.744
TAKING A STEP BACK AND LOOKING

00:57:27.811 --> 00:57:28.845
AT THIS FROM A BROADER

00:57:28.912 --> 00:57:30.713
PERSPECTIVE, AUTHORIZATION FOR

00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:32.982
CARE IS A CRITICAL TOOL. IT

00:57:33.049 --> 00:57:34.317
ENSURES THAT CARE ALIGNS WITH

00:57:34.384 --> 00:57:36.186
THE LATEST GUIDELINES WHILE

00:57:36.252 --> 00:57:37.320
PROTECTING PATIENTS FROM

00:57:37.387 --> 00:57:38.288
UNNECESSARY PROCEDURES,

00:57:38.354 --> 00:57:39.856
EXCESSIVE COSTS, AND HARMFUL

00:57:39.923 --> 00:57:40.890
TREATMENTS, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS

00:57:40.957 --> 00:57:42.959
LOW VALUE CARE. THIS IS A

00:57:43.026 --> 00:57:44.427
STANDARD PRACTICE ACROSS ALL

00:57:44.494 --> 00:57:45.929
MARKETS, INCLUDING MEDI-CAL,

00:57:45.995 --> 00:57:48.097
CALPERS, AND COMMERCIAL MARKETS.

00:57:48.164 --> 00:57:49.199
INDEED, THE STATE BUDGET THAT

00:57:49.265 --> 00:57:50.633
WAS JUST RECENTLY ENACTED AND

00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:51.734
SIGNED INTO LAW ACKNOWLEDGED THE

00:57:51.801 --> 00:57:53.102
IMPORTANCE OF AUTHORIZATION BY

00:57:53.169 --> 00:57:54.404
ADDING IT TO SPECIFIC SERVICES

00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:56.739
IN MEDI-CAL. WHILE WE STRONGLY

00:57:56.806 --> 00:57:57.774
BELIEVE THAT APPROPRIATE CHECKS

00:57:57.841 --> 00:57:59.342
AND BALANCES ARE IMPORTANT TO

00:57:59.409 --> 00:58:01.477
PREVENT LOW VALUE CARE, WE ALSO

00:58:01.544 --> 00:58:02.579
BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:58:02.645 --> 00:58:04.380
EMBRACE SOLUTIONS. THIS IS WHY

00:58:04.447 --> 00:58:06.482
HEALTH PLANS NATIONALLY HAVE

00:58:06.549 --> 00:58:08.551
VOLUNTEERED AND VOLUNTARILY, I

00:58:08.618 --> 00:58:09.853
SHOULD SAY, COMMITTED, TO A SET

00:58:09.919 --> 00:58:12.155
OF REFORMS AIMED AT INCREASING

00:58:12.222 --> 00:58:13.556
TRANSPARENCY, REDUCING

00:58:13.623 --> 00:58:15.391
ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS AND

00:58:15.458 --> 00:58:16.926
ACCELERATING ACCESS TO CARE.

00:58:16.993 --> 00:58:18.294
AMONG THESE IS REDUCING THE

00:58:18.361 --> 00:58:20.897
SCOPE OF CLAIMS SUBJECT TO

00:58:20.964 --> 00:58:22.632
AUTHORIZATION. SIGNATORY PLANS

00:58:22.699 --> 00:58:25.969
TO THIS COMMITMENT HAVE THOSE

00:58:26.035 --> 00:58:28.104
THAT PROVIDE FULLY INSURED ACA

00:58:28.171 --> 00:58:29.305
MARKETPLACE COVERAGE COMMIT THAT

00:58:29.372 --> 00:58:30.340
THEY WILL INDIVIDUALLY REDUCE

00:58:30.406 --> 00:58:32.342
THE VOLUME OF IN-NETWORK PRIOR

00:58:32.408 --> 00:58:34.143
AUTHORIZATIONS BY JANUARY 1ST,

00:58:34.210 --> 00:58:36.379
2026, AND THEY FURTHER COMMIT TO

00:58:36.446 --> 00:58:37.480
PROVIDE DATA ON THE EXTENT OF

00:58:37.547 --> 00:58:39.716
SUCH REDUCTIONS. IN THAT LIGHT,

00:58:39.782 --> 00:58:41.818
WE DO NEED SOME TIME TO SIT WITH

00:58:41.885 --> 00:58:42.719
THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE GOING

00:58:42.785 --> 00:58:44.854
INTO THE BILL TODAY. AND ONCE

00:58:44.921 --> 00:58:46.789
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE FULLY ANALYZED

00:58:46.856 --> 00:58:48.291
THOSE, WE WILL DETERMINE WHETHER

00:58:48.358 --> 00:58:49.959
THEY ALIGN WITH THESE INDUSTRY

00:58:50.026 --> 00:58:51.728
PRINCIPLES AND THAT WILL GUIDE

00:58:51.794 --> 00:58:53.296
OUR POSITION MOVING FORWARD. IN

00:58:53.363 --> 00:58:54.931
THE MEANTIME, WE WANT TO THANK

00:58:54.998 --> 00:58:56.900

COURSE, THE AUTHOR AND THE

00:58:58.401 --> 00:58:59.769
SPONSORS FOR THE LEVEL OF

00:58:59.836 --> 00:59:01.471
DISCUSSION THAT WE'VE HAD ON THE

00:59:01.537 --> 00:59:02.038
ISSUE OF PRIOR AUTHORIZATION

00:59:02.105 --> 00:59:05.108
THIS SESSION THUS FAR. HOWEVER,

00:59:05.174 --> 00:59:06.276
AT THIS TIME, WE REMAIN OPPOSED.

00:59:06.342 --> 00:59:10.179
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GO AHEAD,

00:59:10.246 --> 00:59:10.947

I'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR,

SPONSOR, COMMITTEE STAFF AND THE

00:59:19.222 --> 00:59:20.223
DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH

00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:21.324
CARE FOR THEIR THOUGHTFUL

00:59:21.391 --> 00:59:23.259
ENGAGEMENT ON THE BILL. AS YOU

00:59:23.326 --> 00:59:24.627
KNOW, HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS

00:59:24.694 --> 00:59:26.396
WORK DILIGENTLY TO ENSURE THAT

00:59:26.462 --> 00:59:27.597
ENROLLEES AND INSUREDS ARE

00:59:27.664 --> 00:59:28.998
GETTING THE RIGHT CARE AT THE

00:59:29.065 --> 00:59:30.667
RIGHT TIME FROM THE RIGHT

00:59:30.733 --> 00:59:31.401
PROVIDER. MEDICAL AND

00:59:31.467 --> 00:59:32.168
UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT TOOLS

00:59:32.235 --> 00:59:33.569
LIKE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION, ARE

00:59:33.636 --> 00:59:35.071
KEY TO PROMOTING SAFE AND

00:59:35.138 --> 00:59:36.739
EFFECTIVE CARE FOR ENROLLEES AND

00:59:36.806 --> 00:59:38.007
INSURERS. TO THAT END, HEALTH

00:59:38.074 --> 00:59:39.208
PLANS AND INSURERS ACT AS

00:59:39.275 --> 00:59:40.510
STEWARDS OF THE PREMIUM DOLLAR

00:59:40.576 --> 00:59:42.845
AND THEREFORE HAVE AN OBLIGATION

00:59:42.912 --> 00:59:44.380
TO INVEST THOSE DOLLARS IN

00:59:44.447 --> 00:59:46.482
PROPER AND EFFECTIVE CARE.

00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:47.583
UNDERSTANDING THOSE GOALS, WE

00:59:47.650 --> 00:59:48.985
APPRECIATE THE RECENT AMENDMENTS

00:59:49.052 --> 00:59:50.520
THAT ARE BEING TAKEN TODAY, AS

00:59:50.586 --> 00:59:52.689
WELL AS ALL THE HARD WORK THAT

00:59:52.755 --> 00:59:54.123
HAS GONE INTO ENSURING A

00:59:54.190 --> 00:59:55.425
THOUGHTFUL AND EFFECTIVE PROCESS

00:59:55.491 --> 00:59:57.260
IS ESTABLISHED. UNFORTUNATELY,

00:59:57.327 --> 00:59:58.461
WHILE WE RECOGNIZE HOW FAR THE

00:59:58.528 --> 00:59:59.629
BILL HAS COME, WE WOULD BE

00:59:59.696 --> 01:00:01.631
REMISS IF WE DIDN'T ACKNOWLEDGE

01:00:01.698 --> 01:00:02.632
THERE ARE A FEW OUTSTANDING

01:00:02.699 --> 01:00:03.700
ISSUES THAT WE NEED THAT WE

01:00:03.766 --> 01:00:05.501
WOULD LIKE TO SEE ADDRESSED.

01:00:05.568 --> 01:00:08.571
FIRST AND FOREMOST, AS THE BILL

01:00:08.638 --> 01:00:10.873
STATES, IT CREATES NO LESS THAN

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:13.109
A 90% THRESHOLD. WE'RE CONCERNED

01:00:13.176 --> 01:00:14.544
AND WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST

01:00:14.610 --> 01:00:17.513
THAT BE CONSIDERED TO 95%, GIVEN

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:18.681
THE WORK THAT THE OFFICE OF

01:00:18.748 --> 01:00:19.882
HEALTHCARE AFFORDABILITY HAS

01:00:19.949 --> 01:00:22.085
DONE THIS PAST YEAR, AND SETTING

01:00:22.151 --> 01:00:24.320
THE CURRENT HEALTHCARE TARGET AT

01:00:24.387 --> 01:00:26.055
3.5%, WE'RE CONCERNED THAT 90%

01:00:26.122 --> 01:00:27.190
THRESHOLD REFERENCED IN THE BILL

01:00:27.256 --> 01:00:29.759
MAY BE TOO LOW. ADDITIONALLY, WE

01:00:29.826 --> 01:00:31.260
WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE

01:00:31.327 --> 01:00:32.328
DEFINITION OF THE MOST

01:00:32.395 --> 01:00:33.696
FREQUENTLY APPROVED SERVICES FOR

01:00:33.763 --> 01:00:35.131
THE PURPOSES OF DETERMINING WHAT

01:00:35.198 --> 01:00:36.966
MEETS THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD, BE

01:00:37.033 --> 01:00:38.601
LIMITED TO APPROVALS. CURRENTLY,

01:00:38.668 --> 01:00:40.803
THE DEFINITION INCLUDES

01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:42.338
MODIFICATIONS. MODIFICATIONS FOR

01:00:42.405 --> 01:00:43.940
THE FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES

01:00:44.007 --> 01:00:45.475
ARE CONSIDERED DENIALS AS THEY

01:00:45.541 --> 01:00:47.577
MAKE CHANGES TO THE INITIAL

01:00:47.643 --> 01:00:48.978
REQUEST. FOR THOSE REASONS, WE

01:00:49.045 --> 01:00:52.015
WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE

01:00:52.081 --> 01:00:53.449
THRESHOLD BE LIMITED TO

01:00:53.516 --> 01:00:56.652
APPROVALS ONLY. ADDITIONALLY, WE

01:00:56.719 --> 01:00:57.653
WOULD RECOMMEND. WHILE WE

01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:59.522
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE BILL DOES

01:00:59.589 --> 01:01:01.457
EXCLUDE TIER THREE AND FOUR

01:01:01.524 --> 01:01:02.959
DRUGS, WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE

01:01:03.026 --> 01:01:04.560
FURTHER CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE

01:01:04.627 --> 01:01:07.497
POTENTIAL TO EXCLUDE ALL DRUGS

01:01:07.563 --> 01:01:08.898
AT THIS POINT WITH THE

01:01:08.965 --> 01:01:09.932
CONSIDERATION OF AT A LATER DATE

01:01:09.999 --> 01:01:11.934
COMING BACK AND HAVING THAT

01:01:12.001 --> 01:01:12.835
OVERALL DISCUSSION, GIVEN THE

01:01:12.902 --> 01:01:14.137
WIDESPREAD GROWTH WE HAVE SEEN

01:01:14.203 --> 01:01:15.772
IN THIS SECTOR, WE'RE VERY

01:01:15.838 --> 01:01:17.240
CONCERNED ABOUT THE INCLUSION OF

01:01:17.306 --> 01:01:18.941
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND THE

01:01:19.008 --> 01:01:20.009
POTENTIAL COST IMPACTS THAT MAY

01:01:20.076 --> 01:01:22.979
HAVE ON THE MARKET. AND LASTLY,

01:01:23.046 --> 01:01:24.313
WE WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND THAT

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:26.616
WHILE THE BILL DOES REQUIRE THE

01:01:26.682 --> 01:01:28.618
REGULATORS TO WORK TOGETHER ON

01:01:28.684 --> 01:01:29.752
IMPLEMENTATION, THAT IT WOULD

01:01:29.819 --> 01:01:32.355
REQUIRE THE REGULATORS TO

01:01:32.422 --> 01:01:34.924
COMPILE ONE SINGULAR LIST OF

01:01:34.991 --> 01:01:36.025
SERVICES THAT WOULD BE REMOVED

01:01:36.092 --> 01:01:37.427
FROM PRIOR AUTHORIZATION. SO WE

01:01:37.493 --> 01:01:39.095
WOULD SEE A UNIFORM APPLICATION

01:01:39.162 --> 01:01:42.832
AGAINST ALL MARKET SEGMENTS. SO

01:01:42.899 --> 01:01:44.233
FOR THOSE ARE THE PRIMARY ISSUES

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:45.501
BASED ON THE MOST RECENT REVIEW

01:01:45.568 --> 01:01:47.403
OF THE AMENDMENTS. WE SINCERELY

01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:48.638
APPRECIATE ALL THE HARD WORK

01:01:48.704 --> 01:01:50.440
THAT'S GONE INTO THIS. WE LOOK

01:01:50.506 --> 01:01:50.907
FORWARD TO CONTINUING

01:01:50.973 --> 01:01:52.008
CONVERSATIONS IF THE BILL MOVES

01:01:52.075 --> 01:01:54.510
FORWARD TODAY. BUT THOSE ARE OUR

01:01:54.577 --> 01:01:55.411
REMAINING CONCERNS. THANK YOU.

01:01:55.478 --> 01:01:58.548
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. CHAIR AND

01:01:58.614 --> 01:01:59.849

01:01:59.916 --> 01:02:03.019
OF AMERICA'S PHYSICIAN GROUPS IN

RESPECTFUL OPPOSE, UNLESS

CAPITATED DELEGATED MEDICAL

01:02:09.492 --> 01:02:11.494
GROUPS ACROSS CALIFORNIA WHO ARE

01:02:11.561 --> 01:02:12.562
PROVIDER ORGANIZATIONS THAT

01:02:12.628 --> 01:02:13.696
ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FROM

01:02:13.763 --> 01:02:15.565
HEALTH PLANS FOR CRITICAL

01:02:15.631 --> 01:02:16.532
FUNCTIONS LIKE PRIOR

01:02:16.599 --> 01:02:18.768
AUTHORIZATION REVIEW. A CENTRAL

01:02:18.835 --> 01:02:20.103
FEATURE OF THIS DELEGATED MODEL

01:02:20.169 --> 01:02:22.205
IS THE PHYSICIAN LED UTILIZATION

01:02:22.271 --> 01:02:24.040
MANAGEMENT PROCESS. BASICALLY

01:02:24.107 --> 01:02:25.808
PHYSICIANS MANAGING PHYSICIANS,

01:02:25.875 --> 01:02:27.810
WHICH LEADS AND PROMOTES

01:02:27.877 --> 01:02:29.112
ACCOUNTABILITY, CLINICAL

01:02:29.178 --> 01:02:29.879
APPROPRIATENESS, AND CARE

01:02:29.946 --> 01:02:31.380
DELIVERY THAT IS BOTH TIMELY AND

01:02:31.447 --> 01:02:33.483
COST EFFECTIVE. THE AMENDED

01:02:33.549 --> 01:02:35.184
VERSION OF SB 306 CURRENTLY

01:02:35.251 --> 01:02:36.819
TREATS MODIFICATIONS TO PRIOR

01:02:36.886 --> 01:02:38.688
AUTHORIZATION REQUESTS AS

01:02:38.754 --> 01:02:40.456
APPROVALS. HOWEVER, BEGINNING

01:02:40.523 --> 01:02:42.125
JANUARY 1ST, 2026, ALL HEALTH

01:02:42.191 --> 01:02:44.127
PLANS AND THEIR DELEGATED

01:02:44.193 --> 01:02:45.361
ENTITIES MUST COMPLY WITH

01:02:45.428 --> 01:02:46.829
NATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR QUALITY

01:02:46.896 --> 01:02:48.764
ASSURANCE STANDARDS FOR

UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT UNDER

01:02:51.334 --> 01:02:52.602
NCQA STANDARDS, MOST

01:02:52.668 --> 01:02:53.803
MODIFICATIONS TO A PRIOR

01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:55.104
AUTHORIZATION ARE TREATED AS

01:02:55.171 --> 01:02:57.540
DENIALS, NOT APPROVALS. THIS

01:02:57.607 --> 01:02:59.408
CREATES A CONFLICT BETWEEN SB

01:02:59.475 --> 01:03:02.411
306 AND THE NCQA COMPLIANCE

01:03:02.478 --> 01:03:03.813
REQUIREMENTS ALREADY MANDATED

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:07.550
UNDER AB 133. SB 306 SHOULD

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:09.452
FURTHER BE AMENDED TO ALIGN WITH

01:03:09.519 --> 01:03:11.254
NCQA DEFINITIONS AND STANDARDS,

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:12.722
SPECIFICALLY FOR MODIFICATIONS

01:03:12.788 --> 01:03:15.324
THAT CONSTITUTE MATERIAL CHANGES

01:03:15.391 --> 01:03:16.759
TO REQUESTS. THIS ALIGNMENT IS

01:03:16.826 --> 01:03:18.594
NECESSARY TO AVOID CONFUSION AND

01:03:18.661 --> 01:03:20.329
TO ENSURE CONSISTENT, FEDERALLY

01:03:20.396 --> 01:03:23.232
RECOGNIZED REPORTING METRICS. ÁP

01:03:23.299 --> 01:03:24.534
CONTINUES TO SUPPORT A MORE

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.135
EFFECTIVE AND TRANSPARENT

01:03:26.202 --> 01:03:27.603
APPROACH TO PRIOR AUTHORIZATION

01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:29.372
REFORM. RATHER THAN IMPOSING

01:03:29.438 --> 01:03:31.274
RIGID TIMELINES OR CONFLICTING

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:32.508
DEFINITIONS. REFORMS SHOULD

01:03:32.575 --> 01:03:34.710
FOCUS ON ONE. COLLECTING

01:03:34.777 --> 01:03:36.479
COMPREHENSIVE DATA ON PRIOR

01:03:36.546 --> 01:03:38.381
AUTHORIZATION DENIALS. TWO

01:03:38.447 --> 01:03:39.682
PUBLICLY REPORTING DENIAL RATES

01:03:39.749 --> 01:03:42.919
FOR ALL ORGANIZATIONS PERFORMING

01:03:42.985 --> 01:03:45.821
FUNCTIONS, AND THREE LEVERAGING.

01:03:45.888 --> 01:03:47.757
EXISTING AUTHORITY TO ADDRESS

ORGANIZATIONS WITH EXCESSIVE

01:03:49.158 --> 01:03:51.694
DENIAL RATES. WE LOOK FORWARD TO

01:03:51.761 --> 01:03:53.429
CONTINUED DIALOG WITH THE

01:03:53.496 --> 01:03:54.130
LEGISLATURE COMMITTEE, THE

01:03:54.197 --> 01:03:56.766
AUTHOR, THE SPONSORS, AND OTHER

01:03:56.832 --> 01:03:58.134
STAKEHOLDERS TO IMPROVE SB 306

01:03:58.201 --> 01:04:00.236
IN WAYS THAT PRESERVE CLINICAL

01:04:00.303 --> 01:04:01.404
INTEGRITY, SUPPORT COMPLIANCE,

01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:04.240
AND PROTECT PATIENT ACCESS TO

01:04:04.307 --> 01:04:05.408
TIMELY CARE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR

01:04:05.474 --> 01:04:08.177
CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU. GOOD

01:04:08.244 --> 01:04:09.312
AFTERNOON, CHAIR AND MEMBERS,

01:04:09.378 --> 01:04:11.514
KELLY LARUE HERE WITH RESILIENT

01:04:11.581 --> 01:04:12.515
ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF THE

01:04:12.582 --> 01:04:14.283
CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:15.651
THE CHAMBER'S MEMBERS ARE

01:04:15.718 --> 01:04:16.919
EVALUATING THE NEW LANGUAGE, AND

01:04:16.986 --> 01:04:18.221
WE APPRECIATE THE WORK. THE

01:04:18.287 --> 01:04:19.789
AUTHOR, THE ADMINISTRATION AND

01:04:19.855 --> 01:04:20.856
COMMITTEE HAVE ALL PUT INTO THIS

01:04:20.923 --> 01:04:22.625
POLICY. IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:24.393
COMING. IT'S BEEN A PROCESS.

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:25.695
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO STRIKE

01:04:25.761 --> 01:04:27.630
THE RIGHT BALANCE, REDUCING

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:28.764
ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN FOR

01:04:28.831 --> 01:04:31.667
PROVIDERS, PATIENTS, PLANS ALL

01:04:31.734 --> 01:04:33.135
WITHOUT INCREASING PREMIUMS FOR

01:04:33.202 --> 01:04:35.705
EMPLOYERS AND PATIENTS. THE

01:04:35.771 --> 01:04:37.039
CHAMBER ECHOES MY COLLEAGUES

01:04:37.106 --> 01:04:38.808
CONCERNS REGARDING PRIOR

01:04:38.874 --> 01:04:40.343
MODIFICATIONS TO ENSURE THAT WE

01:04:40.409 --> 01:04:41.677
GET IT RIGHT FOR PROVIDERS AND

01:04:41.744 --> 01:04:45.681
CONSUMERS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

01:04:45.748 --> 01:04:47.149
ARE THERE ANY OTHERS IN THE

01:04:47.216 --> 01:04:48.618
HEARING ROOM WHO WOULD LIKE TO

01:04:48.684 --> 01:04:50.987
OFFER A ME TOO IN OPPOSITION,

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:53.256
PLEASE COME FORWARD, STATE YOUR

01:04:53.322 --> 01:04:55.191
NAME, POSITION ON THE BILL AND

01:04:55.258 --> 01:05:00.129
AFFILIATION. GOOD AFTERNOON

01:05:00.196 --> 01:05:01.097
KATIE ANDREW WITH LOCAL HEALTH

01:05:01.163 --> 01:05:02.565
PLANS OF CALIFORNIA. JUST WANT

01:05:02.632 --> 01:05:04.267
TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE

01:05:04.333 --> 01:05:05.434
RECENT AMENDMENTS. THANK YOU.

01:05:05.501 --> 01:05:08.971
JUST TO AND WE'D LIKE TO REMOVE

01:05:09.038 --> 01:05:09.639
OUR OPPOSITION. THANK YOU, THANK

01:05:09.705 --> 01:05:13.175
YOU. SEEING NO OTHER OPPOSITION,

01:05:13.242 --> 01:05:15.378
I WILL BRING IT BACK TO

01:05:15.444 --> 01:05:16.612
COMMITTEE FOR ANY COMMENTS OR

01:05:16.679 --> 01:05:20.950
QUESTIONS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:05:21.017 --> 01:05:24.754
PATEL. I'LL JUST MAKE A COMMENT

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:26.188
THAT I KNOW THAT THIS COMMITTEE

01:05:26.255 --> 01:05:28.090
HAS HEARD SEVERAL BILLS AND

01:05:28.157 --> 01:05:30.626
MOVED ALONG SEVERAL BILLS ON

01:05:30.693 --> 01:05:32.762
PRIOR AUTHORIZATION,

01:05:32.828 --> 01:05:34.930
MODIFICATIONS AND CHANGES.

01:05:34.997 --> 01:05:38.134
PERSONAL NARRATIVE. MY FATHER

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:40.369
HAD A MEDICAL CONDITION AND HE

01:05:40.436 --> 01:05:41.737
HAD A PRIOR AUTHORIZATION, AND

01:05:41.804 --> 01:05:43.205
THERE WAS A MODIFICATION

01:05:43.272 --> 01:05:44.740
REQUIRED, WHICH WAS A

01:05:44.807 --> 01:05:45.641
SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE, BUT

01:05:45.708 --> 01:05:47.943
NECESSARY BECAUSE THE SCOPE OF

01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:50.112
THE OF THE PROCEDURE WASN'T

01:05:50.179 --> 01:05:51.881
GOING TO BE SUFFICIENT. THAT

01:05:51.947 --> 01:05:53.916
CAUSED A SIX WEEK DELAY IN HIM

01:05:53.983 --> 01:05:54.984
GETTING TREATMENT, AND

01:05:55.051 --> 01:05:57.286
UNFORTUNATELY HE SUCCUMBED

01:05:57.353 --> 01:06:01.257
BEFORE THAT HAPPENED. SO I AS A

01:06:01.324 --> 01:06:03.092
JURIST, THAT WOULD EXCLUDE ME

01:06:03.159 --> 01:06:05.628
FROM A TRIAL. BUT AS A

01:06:05.695 --> 01:06:07.730
LEGISLATOR THAT INFORMS ME IN MY

01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:11.233
DECISION. SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:14.537
TO SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY.

01:06:14.603 --> 01:06:17.440
THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

01:06:17.506 --> 01:06:18.441
SENATOR BECKER, THANK YOU SO

01:06:18.507 --> 01:06:20.409
MUCH. I KNOW THAT THIS HAS BEEN

01:06:20.476 --> 01:06:22.478
A BILL A LONG TIME IN COMING,

01:06:22.545 --> 01:06:25.348
AND WE HEARD THREE OTHER BILLS

01:06:25.414 --> 01:06:28.217
RELATED TO THAT WERE SPONSORED

01:06:28.284 --> 01:06:30.786
BY YOUR PROPONENTS HERE TODAY

01:06:30.853 --> 01:06:32.488
THAT REALLY RELATE TO DIFFERENT

01:06:32.555 --> 01:06:33.589
ASPECTS OF PRIOR AUTHORIZATION

01:06:33.656 --> 01:06:35.358
AND SEVERAL OTHERS THAT RELATED

01:06:35.424 --> 01:06:36.625
TO SPECIFIC SERVICES. I WANTED

01:06:36.692 --> 01:06:38.527
TO JUST DIVE INTO SOME OF THE

01:06:38.594 --> 01:06:41.564
AREAS OF CONCERN RAISED BY THE

01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:45.468
OPPOSITION FOR YOUR FOR YOUR

01:06:45.534 --> 01:06:46.902
OPPORTUNITY TO KIND OF WALK US

01:06:46.969 --> 01:06:50.473
THROUGH YOUR AGREEMENT WITH THE

01:06:50.539 --> 01:06:52.341
AMENDMENTS THAT ALIGN WITH THE

01:06:52.408 --> 01:06:54.210
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT WAS

01:06:54.276 --> 01:06:56.312
VERY LATELY PROVIDED BY DMHC.

01:06:56.379 --> 01:07:00.282
THE FIRST IS AROUND THIS IDEA OF

01:07:00.349 --> 01:07:03.185
THE THRESHOLD BEING SET AT 95%

01:07:03.252 --> 01:07:04.653
INSTEAD OF 90%. I KNOW THAT THAT

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:06.722
WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALSO A

01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:09.558
PART OF YOUR ORIGINAL PIECE OF

01:07:09.625 --> 01:07:11.060
LEGISLATION. DO YOU HAVE ANY

01:07:11.127 --> 01:07:13.095
THOUGHTS ON ON EITHER THE

01:07:13.162 --> 01:07:14.363
CALCULATION THAT WAS USED FOR

01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:17.500
THAT AND WHETHER IT IS SOMETHING

01:07:17.566 --> 01:07:19.535
THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO

01:07:19.602 --> 01:07:22.638
CONSIDER AT THE 90% LEVEL? WELL,

01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:24.373
WE THOUGHT THAT 90% WAS ALREADY

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:28.978
VERY HIGH THRESHOLD, AND THAT

01:07:29.044 --> 01:07:32.681
RECOGNIZES THE. THE, YOU KNOW,

01:07:32.748 --> 01:07:34.817
THE GOAL OF HAVING THAT HIGH

01:07:34.884 --> 01:07:37.086
THRESHOLD, BUT ALSO HAVING

01:07:37.153 --> 01:07:38.020
PROTECTION. LET ME SEE IF I HAVE

01:07:38.087 --> 01:07:42.258
ANY. WE ALSO LOOKED AT OTHER

01:07:42.324 --> 01:07:43.893
REFORMS ON PRIOR AUTHORIZATION

01:07:43.959 --> 01:07:45.895
AND OTHER STATES. THEY HAD USED

01:07:45.961 --> 01:07:48.330
THE SORT OF GOLD STANDARD WHERE

01:07:48.397 --> 01:07:50.666
THEY USE 90% AS THEIR THRESHOLD.

01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:52.101
AND WE THOUGHT THAT WAS A VERY

01:07:52.168 --> 01:07:54.937
HIGH THRESHOLD FOR TRYING TO

01:07:55.004 --> 01:07:57.072
IDENTIFY THESE LOW VALUE PRIOR

01:07:57.139 --> 01:07:58.641
AUTHORIZATION REQUIREMENTS. WE

01:07:58.707 --> 01:08:00.743
WOULD BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE

01:08:00.810 --> 01:08:02.478
EXPLORING ADDITIONAL WAYS TO

01:08:02.545 --> 01:08:04.013
IMPROVE THE BILL. WE DO THINK

01:08:04.079 --> 01:08:06.849
THAT THE SAFEGUARDS THAT ARE IN

01:08:06.916 --> 01:08:07.983
THE AMENDMENTS PROVIDED BY THE

01:08:08.050 --> 01:08:09.218
DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH

01:08:09.285 --> 01:08:10.886
CARE SHOULD HELP, HOPEFULLY

01:08:10.953 --> 01:08:12.388
PROVIDE GREATER COMFORT TO THE

01:08:12.455 --> 01:08:14.089
PLANS FOR BEING ABLE TO REMOVE

01:08:14.156 --> 01:08:15.925
SOMETHING FROM THE PRIOR AUTH

01:08:15.991 --> 01:08:17.927
EXEMPTION LIST. IF THERE IS A

01:08:17.993 --> 01:08:19.495
COST CONCERN OR A FRAUD CONCERN

01:08:19.562 --> 01:08:20.930
OR SAFETY CONCERN, OR ANYTHING

01:08:20.996 --> 01:08:23.098
ELSE. RIGHT. AND SENATOR, YOU

01:08:23.165 --> 01:08:25.134
DID MENTION THAT THIS KIND OF

01:08:25.201 --> 01:08:26.669
FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGES THE

01:08:26.735 --> 01:08:28.838
STRUCTURE OF WHO'S ESTABLISHING

01:08:28.904 --> 01:08:30.539
WHAT SERVICES GET LISTED UNDER

01:08:30.606 --> 01:08:32.441
PRIOR AUTHORIZATION. SEEDS THAT

01:08:32.508 --> 01:08:38.581
TO DMHC THAT FUNDAMENTALLY. WHAT

01:08:38.647 --> 01:08:40.182
IS YOUR ASSESSMENT OF THAT

01:08:40.249 --> 01:08:45.221
PARTICULAR CHANGE? YOU KNOW,

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:46.489
CLEARLY IT WASN'T HOW WE

01:08:46.555 --> 01:08:47.756
STRUCTURED THE BILL INITIALLY. I

01:08:47.823 --> 01:08:50.793
DO THINK THAT, AS I STATED IN MY

01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:52.628
IN MY OPENING, I THINK WITH SOME

01:08:52.695 --> 01:08:54.563
OF THE MODIFICATIONS THAT WE'RE

01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:55.965
WORKING ON WITH THE COMMITTEE,

01:08:56.031 --> 01:08:57.766
THAT STILL CERTAINLY MOVES US IN

01:08:57.833 --> 01:09:00.202
THE RIGHT DIRECTION. IT'S

01:09:00.269 --> 01:09:01.637
CERTAINLY THE ADMINISTRATION'S

01:09:01.704 --> 01:09:04.006
PREFERRED APPROACH. SO IT

01:09:04.073 --> 01:09:06.942
INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF, OF

01:09:07.009 --> 01:09:09.745
SUCCESS ON THAT END. BUT I DO

01:09:09.812 --> 01:09:13.449
THINK THAT IT, IT, IT, YOU KNOW,

01:09:13.516 --> 01:09:16.452
AGAIN, IT'S GOING TO BE

01:09:16.519 --> 01:09:17.686
CERTAINLY POSITIVE AND GET THE

01:09:17.753 --> 01:09:19.522
JOB DONE IF WE CAN, YOU KNOW,

01:09:19.588 --> 01:09:20.689
STRUCTURE IT IN THE WAY THAT

01:09:20.756 --> 01:09:22.825
WE'VE DISCUSSED. AND I ALSO WANT

01:09:22.892 --> 01:09:23.459
TO APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITION'S

01:09:23.526 --> 01:09:25.528
CONCERNS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL OR

01:09:25.594 --> 01:09:27.997
THE REQUEST TO HAVE A COMPLETE

01:09:28.063 --> 01:09:31.267
EXCLUSION OF ALL DRUGS IN THIS.

01:09:31.333 --> 01:09:34.336
WE'VE OBVIOUSLY MADE A

01:09:34.403 --> 01:09:35.771
LIMITATION AROUND THAT TO

01:09:35.838 --> 01:09:37.239
PARTICULAR TYPES OF DRUGS, WHICH

01:09:37.306 --> 01:09:39.341
I THINK WAS OUR COMMITTEE

01:09:39.408 --> 01:09:42.678
AMENDMENT. CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE

01:09:42.745 --> 01:09:44.780
IDEA OF EITHER INCLUDING OR NOT

01:09:44.847 --> 01:09:49.218
INCLUDING DRUGS IN IN THE PRIOR

01:09:49.285 --> 01:09:50.819
AUTHORIZATION LIST? AND THEN I

01:09:50.886 --> 01:09:52.788
ALSO WANTED TO JUST HEAR A

01:09:52.855 --> 01:09:54.823
LITTLE BIT MORE FROM THE

01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:55.925
OPPOSITION ON THIS POINT. YEAH,

01:09:55.991 --> 01:09:58.527
WE HAD A LOT OF DISCUSSION ON

01:09:58.594 --> 01:10:00.396
THIS. MAY I ASK MY SPONSOR IF

01:10:00.462 --> 01:10:02.731
THAT'S OKAY? OF COURSE, FROM THE

01:10:02.798 --> 01:10:04.466
REPORTS THAT WE'VE GOTTEN AND

01:10:04.533 --> 01:10:06.735
THE SURVEYS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE

01:10:06.802 --> 01:10:07.236
IN PRIOR AUTHORIZATION,

01:10:07.303 --> 01:10:07.836
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS MAKE UP A

01:10:07.903 --> 01:10:09.939
VERY LARGE PORTION OF THE PRIOR

01:10:10.005 --> 01:10:10.739
AUTHORIZATION REQUEST THAT

01:10:10.806 --> 01:10:12.608
PHYSICIAN OFFICES HAVE TO REVIEW

01:10:12.675 --> 01:10:15.177
AND RESPOND OR SUBMIT AND SORT

01:10:15.244 --> 01:10:17.513
OF NEGOTIATE WITH PLANS. SO IT

01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:19.214
MAKES UP A REALLY LARGE VOLUME

01:10:19.281 --> 01:10:20.749
OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN

01:10:20.816 --> 01:10:23.319
HERE. WE DID TRY TO TARGET THE

01:10:23.385 --> 01:10:24.820
LOWER COST TIERS HERE, WHICH

01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:26.488
WOULD BE GENERALLY GENERICS AND

01:10:26.555 --> 01:10:29.458
MAYBE PREFERRED BRANDS. AND

01:10:29.525 --> 01:10:30.593
AGAIN, WITH ALL THE SAFEGUARDS

01:10:30.659 --> 01:10:33.028
THAT HAVE BEEN ADDED IN THIS

01:10:33.095 --> 01:10:34.863
LATEST SET OF AMENDMENTS

01:10:34.930 --> 01:10:36.699
ALLOWING THE REGULATORS TO

01:10:36.765 --> 01:10:38.267
WITHHOLD A PARTICULAR MEDICATION

01:10:38.334 --> 01:10:40.202
IN THIS EXAMPLE FROM THAT

01:10:40.269 --> 01:10:42.071
EXEMPTION LIST, IF THERE IS A

01:10:42.137 --> 01:10:43.505
PARTICULARLY POINTED CONCERN

01:10:43.572 --> 01:10:44.940
THAT'S RAISED BY REMOVING PRIOR

01:10:45.007 --> 01:10:46.041
AUTH FOR ANY DRUGS, WE THINK

01:10:46.108 --> 01:10:48.177
THAT THIS IS A REALLY

01:10:48.243 --> 01:10:49.211
APPROPRIATE BALANCE TO STRIKE.

01:10:49.278 --> 01:10:52.081
BUT AGAIN, HAPPY TO CONTINUE

01:10:52.147 --> 01:10:54.483
DISCUSSIONS ON THIS POINT AS

01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:58.187
WELL. THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR,

01:10:58.253 --> 01:10:59.888
FOR THE QUESTION. I THINK FROM

01:10:59.955 --> 01:11:02.257
OUR PERSPECTIVE AND THIS IS

01:11:02.324 --> 01:11:03.692
WELL, NEW TO THE COMMITTEE, THIS

01:11:03.759 --> 01:11:05.194
IS SOMETHING A PROPOSAL THAT WE

01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:07.029
WORKED QUITE A BIT LAST YEAR ON.

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:08.897
AND I KNOW ONE OF THE BIG

01:11:08.964 --> 01:11:10.499
CONVERSATIONS WAS ABOUT THE

01:11:10.566 --> 01:11:11.500
INCLUSION OR EXCLUSION OF DRUGS.

01:11:11.567 --> 01:11:13.736
FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE, LOOKING AT

01:11:13.802 --> 01:11:15.638
THE WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THE

01:11:15.704 --> 01:11:18.340
GROWTH CERTAINLY MORE AND

01:11:18.407 --> 01:11:20.242
SPECIALTY DRUGS IN THE COST, BUT

01:11:20.309 --> 01:11:22.678
IN THE GROWTH IN TOTAL OF DRUGS.

01:11:22.745 --> 01:11:24.380
I THINK ONE OF THE CONVERSATIONS

01:11:24.446 --> 01:11:26.348
WE HAD LAST YEAR WAS ABOUT

01:11:26.415 --> 01:11:27.783
EXCLUDING DRUGS IN THE SHORT

01:11:27.850 --> 01:11:29.084
TERM AND LOOKING TO OKA OR

01:11:29.151 --> 01:11:31.387
ANOTHER ENTITY TO DO A COST

01:11:31.453 --> 01:11:32.821
BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF THE

01:11:32.888 --> 01:11:34.757
POTENTIAL TO INCLUDE DRUGS AT A

01:11:34.823 --> 01:11:36.392
LATER DATE. THAT WAS KIND OF AN

01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:37.493
INTERNAL CONVERSATION THAT WE

01:11:37.559 --> 01:11:40.362
WERE HAVING WITH, YOU KNOW, A

01:11:40.429 --> 01:11:43.365
WAY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT.

01:11:43.432 --> 01:11:44.633
ADDITIONALLY, I THINK, YOU KNOW,

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:47.536
THE THING TO NOTE IS WITH DRUGS,

01:11:47.603 --> 01:11:48.570
HISTORICALLY, I THINK IT'S

01:11:48.637 --> 01:11:50.873
PROBABLY A DECADE AGO, WE

01:11:50.939 --> 01:11:52.708
INCREASED THE TIME FRAMES AND

01:11:52.775 --> 01:11:54.843
THE SPEED FOR WHICH DRUGS WERE

01:11:54.910 --> 01:11:56.211
APPROVED. IT'S A 24, 72 HOUR. WE

01:11:56.278 --> 01:11:58.614
CREATED A SINGLE FORM PROCESS IN

01:11:58.681 --> 01:12:00.149
ORDER TO KIND OF STREAMLINE THAT

01:12:00.215 --> 01:12:02.718
PRIOR AUTHORIZATION SYSTEM. SO

01:12:02.785 --> 01:12:04.787
TO THAT DEGREE, I THINK WE KIND

01:12:04.853 --> 01:12:06.288
OF LOOKED AT THAT BLENDED

01:12:06.355 --> 01:12:08.023
OPPORTUNITY OF MAYBE, YOU KNOW,

01:12:08.090 --> 01:12:10.359
HAVING OKA OR ANOTHER ENTITY

01:12:10.426 --> 01:12:11.827
REALLY DO COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS

01:12:11.894 --> 01:12:13.629
OF WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE. I

01:12:13.696 --> 01:12:14.463
APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT

01:12:14.530 --> 01:12:15.698
THIS COMMITTEE DID TO LOOK AT

01:12:15.764 --> 01:12:17.966
THOSE HIGHER COST TIER THREE AND

01:12:18.033 --> 01:12:20.369
TIER FOUR SPECIALTY DRUGS AS

01:12:20.436 --> 01:12:21.837
HAVING THAT EXCLUSION. BUT AT

01:12:21.904 --> 01:12:23.605
THIS POINT, WE'D LIKE TO

01:12:23.672 --> 01:12:25.007
CONTINUE TO HAVE FURTHER

01:12:25.074 --> 01:12:26.108
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE

01:12:26.175 --> 01:12:27.609
POTENTIAL TO HAVE DRUGS

01:12:27.676 --> 01:12:30.345
EXCLUDED. THANK YOU. AND THEN I

01:12:30.412 --> 01:12:32.047
JUST ALSO WANTED TO JUST SHARE

01:12:32.114 --> 01:12:33.549
THAT WE DO HAVE OTHER

01:12:33.615 --> 01:12:35.517
LEGISLATION COMING THROUGH THAT

01:12:35.584 --> 01:12:38.921
WE WILL BE HEARING VERY SHORTLY

01:12:38.987 --> 01:12:42.224
RELATED TO THE KIND OF THE

01:12:42.291 --> 01:12:43.992
AUTHORITY OF DMHC TO BE ABLE TO

01:12:44.059 --> 01:12:45.661
REALLY LOOK AT SOME OF THE

01:12:45.728 --> 01:12:49.164
EXCESSIVE DENIALS, DENIAL RATES

01:12:49.231 --> 01:12:50.632
THROUGH ANOTHER BILL THAT

01:12:50.699 --> 01:12:53.102
SENATOR WIENER IS BEING PUTTING

01:12:53.168 --> 01:12:53.869
FORWARD. SO I THINK THAT THERE

01:12:53.936 --> 01:12:55.671
IS SOME SYNERGY BETWEEN YOUR

01:12:55.738 --> 01:12:56.872
BILL, SENATOR, AND THAT OF

01:12:56.939 --> 01:12:59.141
SENATOR WIENER'S ON ON THAT

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:01.376
FRONT. SENATOR, KIND OF LAST

01:13:01.443 --> 01:13:03.312
QUESTION FROM ME BEFORE WE MOVE

01:13:03.378 --> 01:13:05.881
ON. WE HAD A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY

01:13:05.948 --> 01:13:08.484
TO HEAR FROM THE PROVIDER'S

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:12.187
PERSPECTIVE, THE OPPORTUNITY

01:13:12.254 --> 01:13:14.990
COSTS THAT COME WITH NOT HAVING

01:13:15.057 --> 01:13:16.425
PRIOR AUTHORIZATION IN PLACE AND

01:13:16.492 --> 01:13:17.960
SOMETHING THAT IS VIABLE FROM

01:13:18.026 --> 01:13:20.896
YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND KIND OF TO

01:13:20.963 --> 01:13:22.998
ASSEMBLYMEMBER PATEL'S POINT,

01:13:23.065 --> 01:13:26.168
THERE IS AN INCREDIBLE IMPACT ON

01:13:26.235 --> 01:13:28.370
PATIENTS AS WELL. IN YOUR

01:13:28.437 --> 01:13:30.038
CLOSING REMARKS, WOULD YOU LIKE

01:13:30.105 --> 01:13:31.573
TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:34.109
OPPORTUNITIES THAT THERE ARE FOR

01:13:34.176 --> 01:13:36.979
INCREASING ACCESS TO CARE FOR

01:13:37.045 --> 01:13:38.747
PATIENTS AND QUALITY OF CARE FOR

01:13:38.814 --> 01:13:40.482
PATIENT OUTCOMES? ABSOLUTELY.

01:13:40.549 --> 01:13:41.850
HAPPY TO DO THAT. MY CLOTHES.

01:13:41.917 --> 01:13:44.419
THANK YOU. I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER

01:13:44.486 --> 01:13:45.687
QUESTIONS. SO PLEASE GO AHEAD,

01:13:45.754 --> 01:13:48.624
SENATOR. WELL THANK YOU. AND

01:13:48.690 --> 01:13:49.992
FIRST TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER PATEL.

01:13:50.058 --> 01:13:51.927
IT'S A JUST A DEVASTATING STORY.

01:13:51.994 --> 01:13:54.363
AND I'M SO SORRY THAT HAPPENED

01:13:54.429 --> 01:13:57.032
WITH YOUR TO YOUR FAMILY. IT

01:13:57.099 --> 01:13:58.834
DOES UNFORTUNATELY HIGHLIGHT THE

01:13:58.901 --> 01:14:03.572
REAL COST OF PRIOR AUTHORIZATION

01:14:03.639 --> 01:14:05.207
DENIAL. AS I AS I MENTIONED IN

01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:08.243
MY OPENING STATEMENT, THE FACT

01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:11.780
THAT 19% OF DOCTORS SAID PATIENT

01:14:11.847 --> 01:14:13.315
WAS HOSPITALIZED BECAUSE OF

01:14:13.382 --> 01:14:15.484
DELAYS AND 13% SAID PATIENTS

01:14:15.551 --> 01:14:17.653
WITH A LIFE THREATENING EVENT,

01:14:17.719 --> 01:14:19.488
THAT'S A THAT'S A THOSE ARE

01:14:19.555 --> 01:14:22.057
EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH NUMBERS AND

01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:24.259
REPRESENTS JUST A MASSIVE RISK

01:14:24.326 --> 01:14:25.527
AND A MASSIVE COST. AND I

01:14:25.594 --> 01:14:27.996
MENTIONED SOMEONE ON MY OWN TEAM

01:14:28.063 --> 01:14:30.632
HAD, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING I WAS

01:14:30.699 --> 01:14:32.401
DRUG THAT WAS APPROVED. BUT THEN

01:14:32.467 --> 01:14:33.635
JUST BECAUSE OF THE ESSENTIALLY

01:14:33.702 --> 01:14:34.937
ALMOST A PACKAGING PIECE THAT

01:14:35.003 --> 01:14:36.338
WAS REQUIRED FOR PRIOR

01:14:36.405 --> 01:14:37.806
AUTHORIZATION HAS HAD TO GO

01:14:37.873 --> 01:14:41.009
THROUGH JUST A REALLY TERRIBLE

01:14:41.076 --> 01:14:43.946
TIME. SO THERE IS A MASSIVE

01:14:44.012 --> 01:14:45.814
COST. AND I KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE'RE

01:14:45.881 --> 01:14:47.916
HERE IN, IN, IN A STATE AND

01:14:47.983 --> 01:14:49.051
THERE'S ONLY CERTAIN THINGS WE

01:14:49.117 --> 01:14:50.619
CAN DO. HEALTHCARE IS ONE OF

01:14:50.686 --> 01:14:53.121
THOSE ISSUES WHERE WE ARE

01:14:53.188 --> 01:14:54.056
OBVIOUSLY GOVERNED IN PART BY

01:14:54.122 --> 01:14:55.624
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BUT JUST

01:14:55.691 --> 01:14:57.326
A QUICK LOOK. COUNTRY BY

01:14:57.392 --> 01:14:58.427
COUNTRY, CANADA, VERY LITTLE

01:14:58.493 --> 01:15:00.095
PRIOR AUTHORIZATION FOR

01:15:00.162 --> 01:15:01.597
MEDICALLY NECESSARY SERVICES. UK

01:15:01.663 --> 01:15:03.131
NO PRIOR AUTHORIZATION FOR MOST

01:15:03.198 --> 01:15:04.399
MEDICAL TREATMENT. GERMANY

01:15:04.466 --> 01:15:05.634
PATIENTS HAVE FREE CHOICE OF

01:15:05.701 --> 01:15:07.469
PROVIDERS AND MOST SERVICES ARE

01:15:07.536 --> 01:15:08.704
OFFERED WITH MINIMAL OR NO PRIOR

01:15:08.770 --> 01:15:09.338
AUTHORIZATION. FRANCE. NO

01:15:09.404 --> 01:15:10.672
GENERAL PRIOR AUTHORIZATION FOR

01:15:10.739 --> 01:15:11.673
HOSPITAL CARE SPECIALISTS.

01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:13.575
JAPAN. PATIENTS CAN GO TO ALMOST

01:15:13.642 --> 01:15:15.344
ANY PROVIDER WITHOUT REFERRAL OR

01:15:15.410 --> 01:15:17.579
PRIOR AUTHORIZATION. AUSTRALIA.

01:15:17.646 --> 01:15:18.981
THE PUBLIC SYSTEM HAS NO PRIOR

01:15:19.047 --> 01:15:22.384
AUTHORIZATION FOR MOST SERVICES.

01:15:22.451 --> 01:15:24.586
AND FAR LESS IN PRIVATE PLANS.

01:15:24.653 --> 01:15:27.055
SO IT'S JUST THIS IS ONE OF

01:15:27.122 --> 01:15:28.557
THESE AREAS WHERE THE US,

01:15:28.624 --> 01:15:30.792
UNFORTUNATELY, IS JUST

01:15:30.859 --> 01:15:32.027
DRAMATICALLY TRAILING THE REST

01:15:32.094 --> 01:15:34.630
OF THE WORLD AND JUST SUBJECTING

01:15:34.696 --> 01:15:37.866
OUR SYSTEM TO JUST REALLY A

01:15:37.933 --> 01:15:40.068
MASSIVE WASTE OF COST AND WITH

01:15:40.135 --> 01:15:41.536
REAL REPERCUSSIONS ON, ON

01:15:41.603 --> 01:15:46.742
PATIENT CARE. SO. I APPRECIATE

01:15:46.808 --> 01:15:48.477
THE TESTIMONY THE PROVIDERS WHO

01:15:48.543 --> 01:15:50.979
HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS EVERY DAY

01:15:51.046 --> 01:15:52.214
APPRECIATE THE PLANS FOR WORKING

01:15:52.281 --> 01:15:54.249
THROUGH IT AND THE

01:15:54.316 --> 01:15:56.652
ADMINISTRATION. AND I THINK WE

01:15:56.718 --> 01:15:58.253
ARE ON A GOOD PATH. AND I

01:15:58.320 --> 01:15:59.655
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE

01:15:59.721 --> 01:16:00.689
VOTE. THANK YOU. SENATOR. WHEN

01:16:00.756 --> 01:16:03.125
WE HAVE QUORUM, WE WILL BE ABLE

01:16:03.191 --> 01:16:04.693
TO ACCEPT A MOTION IN A SECOND

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:06.895
ON THIS. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR

01:16:06.962 --> 01:16:07.696
BRINGING FORWARD THIS BILL. FROM

01:16:07.763 --> 01:16:09.932
MY PERSPECTIVE, THIS BILL IS

01:16:09.998 --> 01:16:11.466
PROBABLY THE MOST

01:16:11.533 --> 01:16:13.168
UNCONVENTIONAL, UNCONVENTIONAL

01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:15.337
OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS RIGHT

01:16:15.404 --> 01:16:17.572
NOW. BUT I DID WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:16:17.639 --> 01:16:20.242
THAT WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:16:20.309 --> 01:16:22.678
FULLY AIR THE POLICY CONCERNS IN

01:16:22.744 --> 01:16:23.812
COMMITTEE SO THAT WE CAN

01:16:34.623 --> 01:16:35.824
VALUE CARE, BUT WE ALSO WANT TO

01:16:35.891 --> 01:16:37.693

SOBER LIVING HOMES. UNLICENSED

01:17:45.727 --> 01:17:47.562
SOBER LIVING HOMES HAVE

01:17:47.629 --> 01:17:48.597
PROLIFERATED THROUGHOUT,

01:17:48.663 --> 01:17:49.865
ESPECIALLY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,

01:17:49.931 --> 01:17:51.833
BUT THEY EXIST ALL OVER

01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:54.703
CALIFORNIA, AND THEY ARE

01:17:54.770 --> 01:17:55.637
PROBLEMATIC, TO SAY THE LEAST.

01:17:55.704 --> 01:17:57.572
THEY'RE PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE

01:17:57.639 --> 01:17:58.940
THERE'S VERY LITTLE ENFORCEMENT

01:17:59.007 --> 01:18:01.610
OF ANY RULES OR REGULATIONS OR

01:18:01.676 --> 01:18:04.012
STATUTES THAT EXIST TO ACTUALLY

01:18:04.079 --> 01:18:05.881
REGULATE THEIR BEHAVIOR. THE

REGULATE UNLICENSED, SOBER

01:18:10.819 --> 01:18:12.354
LIVING HOMES, AND FOR GOOD OR

01:18:12.421 --> 01:18:14.823
FOR ILL, THEY ARE INADEQUATELY

01:18:14.890 --> 01:18:15.991
RESOURCED. AND WHAT THIS BILL

01:18:16.058 --> 01:18:18.927
SIMPLY DOES, IT ALLOWS THE CITY

01:18:18.994 --> 01:18:22.397
OR COUNTY TO MAKE AN ON SITE

01:18:22.464 --> 01:18:24.666

01:18:24.733 --> 01:18:27.769
THE DHS DOES NOT HAVE THE

01:18:27.836 --> 01:18:28.970
RESOURCES TO DO SO. IN OTHER

01:18:29.037 --> 01:18:30.772
WORDS, IF THERE'S BEEN A REPORT,

01:18:30.839 --> 01:18:33.341

INITIATED WITHIN TEN DAYS OR

01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:38.380

01:18:38.447 --> 01:18:40.849
THE CITY OR COUNTY MAY GO IN AND

01:18:40.916 --> 01:18:44.019

01:18:59.568 --> 01:19:00.602
RESIDENTIAL RECOVERY HOUSING

PROVIDES A RANGE OF BENEFITS TO

01:19:02.003 --> 01:19:03.839
SOME OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST

01:19:03.905 --> 01:19:04.439
VULNERABLE RESIDENTS, AND IT'S

01:19:04.506 --> 01:19:05.674
CRITICAL THAT THEIR NEEDS ARE

01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:07.175
PRIORITIZED OVER PROFITS. THAT'S

01:19:07.242 --> 01:19:08.610
WHY COMPLIANCE WITH STATE

01:19:08.677 --> 01:19:09.578
LICENSING LAWS, ADMINISTERED

01:19:09.644 --> 01:19:10.679

01:19:21.256 --> 01:19:22.190
VALID LICENSE FROM THE

01:19:22.257 --> 01:19:23.592
DEPARTMENT BEFORE OPERATING. THE

01:19:23.658 --> 01:19:25.060
DEPARTMENT IS ALSO CURRENTLY

01:19:25.127 --> 01:19:26.261
RESPONSIBLE FOR RECEIVING AND

01:19:26.328 --> 01:19:27.662
INVESTIGATING COMPLAINTS ABOUT

01:19:27.729 --> 01:19:28.730
UNLICENSED FACILITIES THAT ARE

01:19:28.797 --> 01:19:30.098

TREATMENT SERVICES. HOWEVER,

01:19:32.901 --> 01:19:34.069
RECENT STATE AUDIT REVEALED THAT

01:19:34.136 --> 01:19:35.203
THE DEPARTMENT HAS NOT

01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:36.605

FOLLOWED UP ON THESE TYPES OF

01:19:38.473 --> 01:19:39.774
COMPLAINTS. THAT FAILURE HAS

01:19:39.841 --> 01:19:40.909
ALLOWED UNLICENSED OPERATORS

01:19:40.976 --> 01:19:43.145
PROVIDING LEGAL SERVICES TO

01:19:43.211 --> 01:19:44.546

WITHOUT OVERSIGHT OR

01:19:47.349 --> 01:19:48.850
ACCOUNTABILITY. SB 35 WOULD

01:19:48.917 --> 01:19:50.619
RESPOND TO THE AUDITOR'S REQUEST

01:19:50.685 --> 01:19:52.754

INVESTIGATING ALLEGATIONS OF

01:19:55.824 --> 01:19:57.225
UNLICENSED TREATMENT SERVICES.

01:19:57.292 --> 01:19:58.160
IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE

01:19:58.226 --> 01:19:59.761
DEPARTMENT TO CONDUCT FOLLOW UP

01:19:59.828 --> 01:20:01.563

01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:02.931
UNLAWFUL ACTIVITY HAS STOPPED,

01:20:02.998 --> 01:20:03.999
AND ALSO INVESTIGATE OTHER

THE DEPARTMENT FAILS TO MEET

01:20:09.771 --> 01:20:10.772
THESE DEADLINES, COUNTY CAN

BECOMING A MORE AND MORE

01:22:00.882 --> 01:22:02.384
COMPLICATED ISSUE IN OUR

01:22:04.386 --> 01:22:06.321

01:22:06.388 --> 01:22:08.690

THE OVERSIGHT, THE LACKING

01:22:09.491 --> 01:22:11.660

01:22:59.874 --> 01:23:02.377
NOT AS MUCH OF A PROLIFERATION

01:23:02.444 --> 01:23:04.979
AS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND

01:23:05.046 --> 01:23:06.815
ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS HAD

01:23:06.881 --> 01:23:08.483
TO DO WITH OVERSIGHT, LACK OF

01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:10.151
OVERSIGHT, QUALITY OF TREATMENT.

01:23:10.218 --> 01:23:12.921
AND WOULD FOLKS ACTUALLY GET THE

01:23:12.987 --> 01:23:14.756
CARE THAT THEY ARE PROMISED THAT

01:23:14.823 --> 01:23:16.124
THEY'RE GOING TO GET,

01:23:16.191 --> 01:23:17.225
PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU HAVE THESE

01:23:17.292 --> 01:23:18.693
FACILITIES IN RESIDENTIAL

01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:20.795
NEIGHBORHOODS? AND SO REALLY

01:23:20.862 --> 01:23:23.264
APPRECIATE YOU PUTTING YOUR EYES

01:23:23.331 --> 01:23:24.132
ON THIS AND HAPPY TO SUPPORT

01:23:24.199 --> 01:23:27.569
WHEN THE TIME COMES. ASSEMBLY

01:23:27.635 --> 01:23:30.205
MEMBER PATTERSON GREAT. THANK

01:23:30.271 --> 01:23:33.007
YOU. CAN YOU DESCRIBE EXACTLY

01:23:33.074 --> 01:23:36.277
WHAT'S HOW YOU WOULD DO THIS

01:23:36.344 --> 01:23:39.080
BEING UNLICENSED? WELL,

01:23:39.147 --> 01:23:40.115
UNLICENSED SOBER LIVING HOMES

01:23:40.181 --> 01:23:41.616
AREN'T ALLOWED TO PROVIDE, FOR

01:23:41.683 --> 01:23:42.884
EXAMPLE, TREATMENTS. THEY'RE

01:23:42.951 --> 01:23:45.587
AREN'T ALLOWED TO OFFER

01:23:45.653 --> 01:23:47.422
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH MODIFICATION.

01:23:47.489 --> 01:23:49.991
AND SO IF THEY'RE DOING THAT

01:23:50.058 --> 01:23:51.393
THEN OR IF THEY'RE ALLOWING DRUG

01:23:51.459 --> 01:23:54.596
USE TO BE CONTINUED OR INITIATED

01:23:54.662 --> 01:23:56.698
IN THE HOUSE, THEN THEY'RE

01:23:56.765 --> 01:23:58.900
OPERATING ILLEGALLY. AND SO IF

01:23:58.967 --> 01:24:01.336
YOU MAKE A COMPLAINT, TYPICALLY

01:24:01.403 --> 01:24:02.637
A NEIGHBOR MIGHT MAKE A

01:24:02.704 --> 01:24:05.073
COMPLAINT TO DCS AND SAY, HEY,

01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:06.541
YOU KNOW, THERE'S ALL KINDS OF

01:24:06.608 --> 01:24:07.976
PROBLEMS IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD,

01:24:08.042 --> 01:24:10.879
DCS, IN THEORY THEN WOULD

01:24:10.945 --> 01:24:11.913
INVESTIGATE. AND IN THEORY, IF

01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:13.715
THERE'S A VIOLATION, THEN WOULD

01:24:13.782 --> 01:24:15.850
PURSUE THAT VIOLATION.

01:24:15.917 --> 01:24:16.785
UNFORTUNATELY, AS I MENTIONED,

01:24:16.851 --> 01:24:18.286
THEY ARE INADEQUATELY RESOURCED.

01:24:18.353 --> 01:24:20.455
AND SO MOST OFTEN NOTHING

01:24:20.522 --> 01:24:22.323
HAPPENS WHEN NOTHING HAPPENS.

01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:24.893
THESE KINDS OF UNLICENSED, SOBER

01:24:24.959 --> 01:24:25.860
LIVING HOMES THAT ARE OPERATING,

01:24:25.927 --> 01:24:28.096
IN MY VIEW, ILLEGALLY

01:24:28.163 --> 01:24:29.297
PROLIFERATE, PROLIFERATE. AND

01:24:29.364 --> 01:24:30.965
THAT'S WHY CERTAIN AREAS IN

01:24:31.032 --> 01:24:32.801
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ARE KNOWN AS

01:24:32.867 --> 01:24:34.702
THE REHAB RIVIERA. OR WHEN I WAS

01:24:34.769 --> 01:24:36.538
IN THE US ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, WE

01:24:36.604 --> 01:24:38.840
CALLED IT COASTAL DEL FRAUD.

01:24:38.907 --> 01:24:40.642
YEAH. SO THEY'RE OPERATING

01:24:40.708 --> 01:24:43.311
UNDER, YOU KNOW, JUST BEING A

01:24:43.378 --> 01:24:45.413
SOBER LIVING HOME OR SOMETHING

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:47.148
LIKE THAT, BUT THEY'RE ALLOWING

01:24:47.215 --> 01:24:50.752
CERTAIN ACTIVITIES TO GO BEYOND.

01:24:50.819 --> 01:24:56.191
AND WHAT WOULD. WHAT KIND OF

01:24:56.257 --> 01:24:58.026
AUTHORITY DO THEY HAVE OF THESE

01:24:58.092 --> 01:24:59.794
HOMES IF THEY'RE NOT LICENSED?

01:24:59.861 --> 01:25:02.730
WELL, IF YOU ARE PROVIDING A

01:25:02.797 --> 01:25:04.199
LOCATION WHERE ILLEGAL DRUG USE

01:25:04.265 --> 01:25:06.668
IS HAPPENING OR YOU ARE

01:25:06.734 --> 01:25:07.669
ADVERTISING, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT

01:25:07.735 --> 01:25:09.103
YOU PROVIDE TREATMENT AND YOU'RE

01:25:09.170 --> 01:25:11.139
NOT, THERE ARE A VARIETY OF

01:25:11.206 --> 01:25:12.307
SANCTIONS THAT CAN BE IMPOSED,

01:25:12.373 --> 01:25:13.374
EVERYTHING FROM CRIMINAL

01:25:13.441 --> 01:25:14.576
SANCTIONS TO CIVIL SANCTIONS.

01:25:14.642 --> 01:25:15.877
AND ARE THESE OFTEN THE HOMES

01:25:15.944 --> 01:25:19.681
WITH SIX OR FEWER BEDS? I SHOULD

01:25:19.747 --> 01:25:22.183
DEFER TO MISS GRINDER, BUT

01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:23.651
WHETHER THEY'RE SIX OR FEWER, I

01:25:23.718 --> 01:25:25.420
THINK THAT'S THE AUTHORIZED

01:25:25.487 --> 01:25:27.989
MAXIMUM. BUT BUT THAT'S ONE OF

01:25:28.056 --> 01:25:30.091
THE VIOLATIONS IS WHEN THEY HAVE

01:25:30.158 --> 01:25:31.759
MORE THAN SIX, THAT'S A

01:25:31.826 --> 01:25:33.661
VIOLATION, OKAY. IF YOU HAVE

01:25:33.728 --> 01:25:34.896
MORE THAN SIX, THEN YOU'RE

01:25:34.963 --> 01:25:36.264
SUBJECT TO CERTAIN ZONING

01:25:36.331 --> 01:25:37.232
REQUIREMENTS WITHIN THE CITY

01:25:37.298 --> 01:25:39.834
UNDER SIX. YEAH, YEAH. I USED TO

01:25:39.901 --> 01:25:41.169
WORK FOR AN ORANGE COUNTY

01:25:41.236 --> 01:25:42.570
LEGISLATOR BACK IN THE DAY, AND

01:25:42.637 --> 01:25:44.439
I REMEMBER IT BEING AN ISSUE

01:25:44.506 --> 01:25:45.707
DOWN THERE. BUT IT'S ALSO BECOME

01:25:45.773 --> 01:25:46.908
AN ISSUE IN OTHER COMMUNITIES AS

01:25:46.975 --> 01:25:48.643
WELL. BUT BUT SOMETIMES JUST A

01:25:48.710 --> 01:25:53.515
QUESTION, ARE THESE HOMES OFTEN

01:25:53.581 --> 01:25:56.050
GOVERNMENT FUNDED, FUNDED BY

01:25:56.117 --> 01:25:57.051
SOME. MAYBE THEY GET A GRANT,

01:25:57.118 --> 01:25:58.620
MAYBE A NONPROFIT GETS A GRANT

01:25:58.686 --> 01:26:00.188
OR SOMETHING FOR A SOBER LIVING

01:26:00.255 --> 01:26:02.891
HOME, AND THEN THEY END UP DOING

01:26:02.957 --> 01:26:04.592
OTHER THINGS THERE. DOES THAT

01:26:04.659 --> 01:26:06.394
HAPPEN AT TIMES? DOES IT HAPPEN?

01:26:06.461 --> 01:26:08.229
I WOULD EXPECT IT HAPPENS, BUT

01:26:08.296 --> 01:26:09.831
MOST OFTEN THEY'RE FOR PROFIT.

01:26:09.898 --> 01:26:12.133
BUT AGAIN, I'LL DEFER TO OUR

01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:13.635
EXPERT. SOME OF THE ELIGIBLE

01:26:13.701 --> 01:26:15.470
USES OF PROPOSITION ONE WERE FOR

01:26:15.537 --> 01:26:16.671
THESE TYPES OF FACILITIES AS

01:26:16.738 --> 01:26:18.706
WELL. THAT WAS KIND OF WHAT WE

01:26:18.773 --> 01:26:20.508
WERE ALLUDING TO WITH LIKE LOTS

01:26:20.575 --> 01:26:21.843
OF MONEY IN THE PIPELINE FOR

01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:23.244
THESE TYPES OF FACILITIES. IT

01:26:23.311 --> 01:26:24.846
CAN BE A MIX. BUT, YOU KNOW, TO

01:26:24.913 --> 01:26:26.548
THE SENATOR'S POINT, IT'S

01:26:26.614 --> 01:26:28.082
LARGELY FOR PROFIT. YEAH. WELL,

01:26:28.149 --> 01:26:28.716
I THINK THIS BILL IS REALLY

01:26:28.783 --> 01:26:29.651
IMPORTANT FOR ALL THE REASONS

01:26:29.717 --> 01:26:31.653
THAT YOU OUTLINED IN MY OWN

01:26:31.719 --> 01:26:33.421
COMMUNITY, YOU KNOW, AS AN

01:26:33.488 --> 01:26:34.789
ORGANIZATION IN CHARGE OF SORT

01:26:34.856 --> 01:26:38.393
OF ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS IN MY

01:26:38.459 --> 01:26:39.594
COMMUNITY, WHICH HAS ACTUALLY

01:26:39.661 --> 01:26:42.330
PARTNERED WITH THE COUNTY, WAS

01:26:42.397 --> 01:26:44.899
PUTTING SOME OF THESE HOMES FOR

01:26:44.966 --> 01:26:46.401
INTENDED FOR HOMELESS

01:26:46.467 --> 01:26:47.969
INDIVIDUALS, WHICH IS FINE, YOU

01:26:48.036 --> 01:26:49.837
KNOW, USING GOVERNMENT FUNDS.

01:26:49.904 --> 01:26:51.406
BUT THEY WERE DOING IT IN THE

01:26:51.472 --> 01:26:52.807
COMMUNITIES WITHOUT WORKING WITH

01:26:52.874 --> 01:26:53.775
THE COMMUNITY AT ALL. AND THAT'S

01:26:53.841 --> 01:26:55.343
A WHOLE SEPARATE PROBLEM. I

01:26:55.410 --> 01:26:56.878
THINK THAT THAT ORGANIZATION HAS

01:26:56.945 --> 01:26:58.179
IN TERMS OF WORKING WITH

01:26:58.246 --> 01:26:59.314
ACTUALLY WORKING WITH THE

01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:00.648
COMMUNITIES, BUT THEY GOT THEIR

01:27:00.715 --> 01:27:01.916
FUNDS FROM THE COUNTY. AGAIN,

01:27:01.983 --> 01:27:04.752
ANOTHER PROBLEM I HAD, BUT THE

01:27:04.819 --> 01:27:07.255
OTHER THING IS, I THINK WE'LL BE

01:27:07.322 --> 01:27:09.390
THE PROLIFERATION OF THESE

01:27:09.457 --> 01:27:11.192
BECAUSE OF THE PROP ONE. AND I

01:27:11.259 --> 01:27:12.594
BROUGHT THIS UP IN COMMITTEE

01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:14.195
MANY TIMES WHEN PROP ONE WAS

01:27:14.262 --> 01:27:15.363
COMING THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE,

01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:17.165
THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BECOME AN

01:27:17.231 --> 01:27:20.001
ISSUE. AND SO I THINK TO GIVE

01:27:20.068 --> 01:27:21.769
SOME KIND OF ENFORCEMENT OR SOME

01:27:21.836 --> 01:27:23.805
KIND OF TEETH WHEN THESE KIND OF

01:27:23.871 --> 01:27:24.606
COMPLAINTS ARE COMING IN, I

01:27:24.672 --> 01:27:25.840
MEAN, SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE

01:27:25.907 --> 01:27:28.343
ABOUT IT. AND ESPECIALLY IF

01:27:28.409 --> 01:27:30.111
GOVERNMENT FUNDS ARE GOING INTO

01:27:30.178 --> 01:27:31.746
THESE FACILITIES IN THE FIRST

01:27:31.813 --> 01:27:32.947
PLACE. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO

01:27:33.014 --> 01:27:34.816
SUPPORTING YOUR BILL. AND IF THE

01:27:34.882 --> 01:27:36.351
TIME COMES, I ACTUALLY WOULD

01:27:36.417 --> 01:27:37.485
LOVE TO BE A COAUTHOR ON IT.

01:27:37.552 --> 01:27:38.653
THANK YOU. WE WELCOME THAT.

01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:41.456
THANK YOU. VERY WELL. THANK YOU.

01:27:41.522 --> 01:27:43.358
SENATOR. I JUST WE HAD A COUPLE

01:27:43.424 --> 01:27:45.860
OF QUESTIONS AND IT KIND OF CAME

01:27:45.927 --> 01:27:47.161
UP IN OUR IN THE DISCUSSIONS

01:27:47.228 --> 01:27:50.198
AROUND THIS BILL. ONE IS THERE

01:27:50.264 --> 01:27:53.334
IS THE POTENTIAL FOR THE

01:27:53.401 --> 01:27:55.236
ASSOCIATED LICENSURE FEES OR THE

01:27:55.303 --> 01:27:58.006
FEE TO BE CONSIDERABLE AND

01:27:58.072 --> 01:28:01.676
POTENTIALLY PROHIBITIVE FOR

01:28:01.743 --> 01:28:04.512
RESIDENTIAL RECOVERY RESIDENCES

01:28:04.579 --> 01:28:05.913
SHOULD THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD.

01:28:05.980 --> 01:28:08.349
HAVE YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY

01:28:08.416 --> 01:28:09.484
THOUGHTS AROUND THE NEED

01:28:09.550 --> 01:28:12.420
ULTIMATELY TO HAVE A QUALIFIED,

01:28:12.487 --> 01:28:17.158
BONAFIDE AND LEGITIMATE RECOVERY

01:28:17.225 --> 01:28:18.426
RESIDENCES FROM HAVING TO DEAL

01:28:18.493 --> 01:28:20.995
WITH THE WEIGHT OF THE INCREASED

01:28:21.062 --> 01:28:24.666
LICENSURE FEES? WELL, LET ME

01:28:24.732 --> 01:28:26.167
TURN AGAIN TO THE EXPERT. BUT SO

01:28:26.234 --> 01:28:28.002
FAR AS I KNOW, THIS BILL DOESN'T

01:28:28.069 --> 01:28:31.105
DEAL AT ALL WITH FEES. AND SO IT

01:28:31.172 --> 01:28:33.241
IF YOU'RE UNLICENSED, THEN THERE

01:28:33.307 --> 01:28:35.843
ISN'T A UNLICENSED FEE. BUT LET

01:28:35.910 --> 01:28:38.813
ME LET ME TURN TO THE EXPERT

01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:39.280
HERE. YEAH, IT'S OUR

01:28:39.347 --> 01:28:40.248
UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE WAS

01:28:40.314 --> 01:28:41.449
BUDGET ALLOCATIONS TO THE

01:28:41.516 --> 01:28:44.552
DEPARTMENT IN 2023 TO HELP TO

01:28:44.619 --> 01:28:45.453
INCREASE THEIR ENFORCEMENT

01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:47.588
CAPACITY AND TO HELP REACH SOME

01:28:47.655 --> 01:28:49.557
OF THEIR GOALS OF RESPONDING IN

01:28:49.624 --> 01:28:51.659
A TIMELY MANNER TO SOME OF THESE

01:28:51.726 --> 01:28:53.227
COMPLAINTS. AND SO WE ARE IN

01:28:53.294 --> 01:28:54.062
CONVERSATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT

01:28:54.128 --> 01:28:55.296
ABOUT HOW THEY REACH THOSE

01:28:55.363 --> 01:28:56.731
GOALS. AND I KNOW THAT THEY'RE

01:28:56.798 --> 01:28:58.900
GOING TO BE RESPONDING TO THE

01:28:58.966 --> 01:28:59.967
DEPARTMENT OR TO THE AUDIT WITH

01:29:00.034 --> 01:29:01.769
SOME NEEDED REFORMS. AND SO IT'S

01:29:01.836 --> 01:29:03.371
IT IS OUR HOPE THAT THEY'RE

01:29:03.438 --> 01:29:05.006
PLANNING FOR CHANGES ALONG THESE

01:29:05.073 --> 01:29:06.674
LINES ANYWAY, IN RESPONSE TO THE

01:29:06.741 --> 01:29:08.576
AUDIT AND HAVE HAD PREVIOUS

01:29:08.643 --> 01:29:09.644
BUDGET ALLOCATIONS THAT WOULD

01:29:09.711 --> 01:29:11.145
HELP THEM BEEF UP THEIR

01:29:11.212 --> 01:29:11.779
COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENT. RIGHT. I

01:29:11.846 --> 01:29:13.781
THINK THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

01:29:13.848 --> 01:29:17.151
THE RECOVERY RESIDENTS AND THE

01:29:17.218 --> 01:29:18.920
ASSOCIATED PARENTS, AND THE

01:29:18.986 --> 01:29:20.054
RELATIONSHIP THAT THERE IS

01:29:20.121 --> 01:29:21.422
BETWEEN THOSE, THE MONEY

01:29:21.489 --> 01:29:24.759
TRANSFER, THE LOOK AT, THE MONEY

01:29:24.826 --> 01:29:26.561
TRANSFERS BETWEEN THOSE ARE

01:29:26.627 --> 01:29:28.396
ULTIMATELY GOING TO GENERATE

01:29:28.463 --> 01:29:30.565
SOME COSTS. THERE ARE GOING TO

01:29:30.631 --> 01:29:32.333
BE SOME COST DRIVERS ASSOCIATED

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:33.534
WITH THAT. IT'S NOT A QUESTION

01:29:33.601 --> 01:29:35.236
FOR THIS POLICY COMMITTEE

01:29:35.303 --> 01:29:37.338
OVERALL, BUT IT IS AN

01:29:37.405 --> 01:29:39.173
CONSIDERATION AROUND WHETHER OR

01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:40.975
NOT WE ULTIMATELY ARE GOING TO

01:29:41.042 --> 01:29:44.212
BE FEE INCREASING SO MUCH THAT

01:29:44.278 --> 01:29:45.646
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO BE

01:29:45.713 --> 01:29:47.448
ABLE TO PROVIDE THIS VERY

01:29:47.515 --> 01:29:48.816
IMPORTANT SERVICE. SO IT'S JUST

01:29:48.883 --> 01:29:50.985
SOMETHING TO CONSIDER FOR A

01:29:51.052 --> 01:29:53.154
SENATOR. AND I GUESS YOU ARE

01:29:53.221 --> 01:29:54.555
CORRECT, MADAM CHAIR, THAT TO

01:29:54.622 --> 01:29:57.925
THE EXTENT THAT YOU INCREASE

01:29:57.992 --> 01:29:58.926
INVESTIGATIONS, WHICH IS WHAT I

01:29:58.993 --> 01:30:00.862
WOULD HOPE WOULD HAPPEN, THAT

01:30:00.928 --> 01:30:03.197
NEEDS TO BE PAID FOR SOMEPLACE

01:30:03.264 --> 01:30:05.066
QUERY WHETHER IT WHERE IT COMES

01:30:05.133 --> 01:30:06.434
FROM, IT COULD COME FROM THE

01:30:06.501 --> 01:30:08.002
GENERAL FUND COULD COME FROM

01:30:08.069 --> 01:30:10.104
INCREASED LICENSE FEES. BUT

01:30:10.171 --> 01:30:11.506
THAT'S AS YOU SAY, THAT'S A

01:30:11.572 --> 01:30:14.709
THAT'S A ISSUE FOR A DIFFERENT

01:30:14.776 --> 01:30:16.911
DAY AND A DIFFERENT COMMITTEE I

01:30:16.978 --> 01:30:21.415
APPRECIATE THAT. Þ WE HAVE ONE

01:30:21.482 --> 01:30:23.985
OTHER ME TOO. WHO I WAS TOO

01:30:24.051 --> 01:30:26.721
QUICK FROM THE TV TO THE ROOM

01:30:26.788 --> 01:30:27.755
WHO WAS GOING TO OFFER IN

01:30:27.822 --> 01:30:28.656
SUPPORT. MADAM CHAIR, YOU WERE

01:30:28.723 --> 01:30:29.824
NOT TOO QUICK. I'VE BEEN

01:30:29.891 --> 01:30:31.159
BOUNCING FROM COMMITTEE TO

01:30:31.225 --> 01:30:31.959
COMMITTEE, AND I APOLOGIZE FOR

01:30:32.026 --> 01:30:33.561
THE TARDINESS. KOBE PEZZATI, ON

01:30:33.628 --> 01:30:35.863
BEHALF OF THE CITIES OF THOUSAND

01:30:35.930 --> 01:30:37.198
OAKS AND CARLSBAD AND STRONG

01:30:37.265 --> 01:30:39.634
SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU.

01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:41.435
I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS

01:30:41.502 --> 01:30:42.837
OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE.

01:30:42.904 --> 01:30:44.806
AND, SENATOR, I WILL SEE YOU

01:30:44.872 --> 01:30:46.741
SOMEWHERE AROUND MIDNIGHT WITH

01:30:46.808 --> 01:30:48.543
THAT. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE?

01:30:48.609 --> 01:30:50.444
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I URGE YOU

01:30:50.511 --> 01:30:52.480

01:30:52.547 --> 01:30:54.916
AND I VOTE AS WELL. THANK YOU, I

01:30:54.982 --> 01:30:55.883
APPRECIATE THAT. AND WHEN WE

01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:59.020
HAVE QUORUM, WE WILL BE ABLE TO

01:30:59.086 --> 01:31:09.163
CONSIDER THAT REQUEST.

01:31:09.230 --> 01:31:11.666
MOVING ON TO ITEM NUMBER FOUR,

01:31:11.732 --> 01:31:29.717
SB 62 BY MENGIBAR.

01:31:35.122 --> 01:31:38.259
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY, SENATOR.

01:31:38.326 --> 01:31:40.061
AND PRESS THE BUTTON CHAIR.

01:31:40.127 --> 01:31:41.195
THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR. GOOD

01:31:41.262 --> 01:31:42.997
AFTERNOON EVERYONE. I'M HERE TO

01:31:43.064 --> 01:31:44.432
PRESENT A BILL THAT IS VERY

01:31:44.498 --> 01:31:45.833
SIMILAR TO SOMETHING THAT YOU

01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:47.068
SAW IN THE FIRST HOUSE, AS THIS

01:31:47.134 --> 01:31:49.570
IS THE BILL THAT BOTH CHAIRS ARE

01:31:49.637 --> 01:31:50.504
CARRYING SIMULTANEOUSLY TO

01:31:50.571 --> 01:31:52.673
ENSURE TO INCREASE OUR ESSENTIAL

01:31:52.740 --> 01:31:54.175
HEALTH BENEFITS. SO YOU'VE

01:31:54.242 --> 01:31:55.610
PROBABLY SEEN A COUPLE OF US IN

01:31:55.676 --> 01:31:58.279
THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS LOOK TO

01:31:58.346 --> 01:31:59.614
INTRODUCE BILLS THAT WANTED TO

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:02.116
ADD COVERAGE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:32:02.183 --> 01:32:03.517
FROM SANTA CLARITA. YOU KNOW

01:32:03.584 --> 01:32:04.819
THAT I'VE INTRODUCED A BILL ON

01:32:04.886 --> 01:32:05.853
HEARING AIDS FOR CHILDREN. AND

01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:07.855
WE ALWAYS WONDER, LIKE, WHY ARE

01:32:07.922 --> 01:32:09.090
THESE GETTING VETOED? THESE ARE

01:32:09.156 --> 01:32:10.691
REALLY JUST CAUSES THAT WE NEED

01:32:10.758 --> 01:32:11.859
TO PROVIDE HEARING AIDS FOR OUR

01:32:11.926 --> 01:32:14.629
KIDS. WHAT'S BECAUSE IT GOES

01:32:14.695 --> 01:32:16.030
ABOVE THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH

01:32:16.097 --> 01:32:17.899
BENEFITS REQUIRED UNDER MANDATED

01:32:17.965 --> 01:32:19.867
COVERAGE FOR CERTAIN PLANS. AND

01:32:19.934 --> 01:32:23.204
WE CAN'T ADD THESE ADDITIONAL

01:32:23.271 --> 01:32:24.906
COVERAGE UNLESS WE DO A REQUEST

01:32:24.972 --> 01:32:26.307
TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO

01:32:26.374 --> 01:32:27.642
INCREASE OUR ESSENTIAL HEALTH

01:32:27.708 --> 01:32:29.110
BENEFITS. SO THIS STARTED LAST

01:32:29.176 --> 01:32:30.578
YEAR WITH THE PREVIOUS HEALTH

01:32:30.645 --> 01:32:32.380
CHAIR STARTING THAT WORK, AND

01:32:32.446 --> 01:32:34.448
THEN THIS YEAR THROUGH

01:32:34.515 --> 01:32:37.018
STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS, THROUGH A

01:32:37.084 --> 01:32:38.786
JOINT INFORMATIONAL HEARING THAT

01:32:38.853 --> 01:32:40.788
BOTH HOUSES PUT ON IN THIS VERY

01:32:40.855 --> 01:32:41.989
ROOM. TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE

01:32:42.056 --> 01:32:43.557
SHOULD ADD, WE CAME UP WITH

01:32:43.624 --> 01:32:45.960
THESE ITEMS AND SB 62 IS LOOKING

01:32:46.027 --> 01:32:48.496
TO NOW CODIFY IF THE FEDERAL

01:32:48.562 --> 01:32:50.932
GOVERNMENT APPROVES US TO ADD TO

01:32:50.998 --> 01:32:52.533
OUR ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS,

01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:54.302
THINGS LIKE NOT THINGS LIKE

01:32:54.368 --> 01:32:55.870
THESE SPECIFIC THINGS HEARING

01:32:55.937 --> 01:32:57.471
AIDS FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS,

01:32:57.538 --> 01:32:58.606
DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT SUCH

01:32:58.673 --> 01:33:00.074
AS WHEELCHAIRS, PERSONAL

01:33:00.141 --> 01:33:01.842
MOBILITY DEVICES, AND

01:33:01.909 --> 01:33:03.210
INFERTILITY DIAGNOSIS AND

01:33:03.277 --> 01:33:06.948
TREATMENT, WHICH INCLUDES IVF. I

01:33:07.014 --> 01:33:08.482
DON'T IGNORE THE FACT THAT THIS

01:33:08.549 --> 01:33:10.651
WILL RESULT, AS WE'VE HEARD, IN

01:33:10.718 --> 01:33:12.720
SOME INCREASES IN PREMIUM COSTS.

01:33:12.787 --> 01:33:15.122
ACCORDING TO IT COULD COULD BE

01:33:15.189 --> 01:33:17.992
AN INCREASE OF $8.55 PER MEMBER

01:33:18.059 --> 01:33:20.261
PER MONTH IN PREMIUM OF SILVER

01:33:20.328 --> 01:33:21.228
PLANTS. BUT I DO BELIEVE,

01:33:21.295 --> 01:33:22.763
COLLEAGUES, IT'S A TRADE OFF

01:33:22.830 --> 01:33:23.698
THAT IS WORTH IT, BECAUSE WE

01:33:23.764 --> 01:33:26.901
WILL BE ABLE TO GIVE A CHILD WHO

01:33:26.968 --> 01:33:28.202
IS HARD OF HEARING OR DEAF

01:33:28.269 --> 01:33:28.869
HEARING AIDS THAT CURRENTLY COST

01:33:28.936 --> 01:33:31.238
PARENTS APPROXIMATELY 3 TO $5000

01:33:31.305 --> 01:33:34.642
EVERY THREE YEARS. AND DON'T GET

01:33:34.709 --> 01:33:35.276
ME STARTED ON FERTILITY COSTS.

01:33:35.343 --> 01:33:37.144
WE KNOW THAT'S AROUND TENS AND

01:33:37.211 --> 01:33:37.878
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS

01:33:37.945 --> 01:33:39.380
THAT IMPACT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

01:33:39.447 --> 01:33:41.983
IN CALIFORNIA. NOW, THE TIMELINE

01:33:42.049 --> 01:33:43.117
HAS PASSED IN TERMS OF

01:33:43.184 --> 01:33:44.819
SUBMITTING THE PLAN. WE HAVE

01:33:44.885 --> 01:33:46.187
ALREADY SUBMITTED TO THE FEDERAL

01:33:46.253 --> 01:33:47.288
GOVERNMENT, AND WE'RE MERELY

01:33:47.355 --> 01:33:48.656
WAITING. SO THIS BILL, LIKE I

01:33:48.723 --> 01:33:50.157
MENTIONED, WOULD SIMPLY CODIFY

01:33:50.224 --> 01:33:51.892
SHOULD THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:33:51.959 --> 01:33:54.362
APPROVE OUR PLAN. MADAM CHAIR,

01:33:54.428 --> 01:33:56.998
I'D LIKE TO NOW TURN OVER TO MY

01:33:57.064 --> 01:33:58.733
WITNESS. THANK YOU. YOU'LL HAVE

01:33:58.799 --> 01:34:00.234
TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU. DIANNA

01:34:00.301 --> 01:34:02.036
DOUGLAS WITH HEALTH ACCESS

01:34:02.103 --> 01:34:03.170
CALIFORNIA, WE ARE PLEASED TO

01:34:03.237 --> 01:34:05.673
SUPPORT SB 62, WHICH WE, AS WE

01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:06.741
HEARD, COMES AFTER A LONG

01:34:06.807 --> 01:34:08.142
PROCESS TO SOLICIT STAKEHOLDER

01:34:08.209 --> 01:34:09.343
FEEDBACK ON POTENTIAL UPDATES TO

01:34:09.410 --> 01:34:11.245
OUR STATE'S BENCHMARK PLAN.

01:34:11.312 --> 01:34:12.446
HEALTH ACCESS IS PLEASED TO

01:34:12.513 --> 01:34:13.814
SUPPORT AND BELIEVES THE NEW

01:34:13.881 --> 01:34:15.416
REQUIRED BENEFITS WILL PROVIDE

01:34:15.483 --> 01:34:16.283
SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT TO

01:34:16.350 --> 01:34:17.852
CONSUMERS. WE WERE PART OF THE

01:34:17.918 --> 01:34:19.186
ORIGINAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE

01:34:19.253 --> 01:34:21.489
FIRST HB STANDARDS IN 2014, AND

01:34:21.555 --> 01:34:23.157
AT THE TIME, WE KNEW THAT NOT

01:34:23.224 --> 01:34:24.191
EVERYTHING CONSUMERS WANTED OR

01:34:24.258 --> 01:34:26.060
EVEN NEEDED WAS INCLUDED, BUT IT

01:34:26.127 --> 01:34:27.661
WAS THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE

01:34:27.728 --> 01:34:28.996
BENEFIT PACKAGE THAT WE COULD

01:34:29.063 --> 01:34:30.464
DEVELOP UNDER THE RULES THAT

01:34:30.531 --> 01:34:31.766
APPLIED. THEN IN THE DECADE

01:34:31.832 --> 01:34:33.167
SINCE, THE RULES HAVE CHANGED,

01:34:33.234 --> 01:34:34.068
WE'VE SEEN THAT CALIFORNIA CAN

01:34:34.135 --> 01:34:35.870
LEAD THE WAY IN HIGHER STANDARDS

01:34:35.936 --> 01:34:38.039
OF CARE, AND WE HAVE THIS

01:34:38.105 --> 01:34:39.073
OPPORTUNITY NOW. SB 62, AS WE

01:34:39.140 --> 01:34:41.075

01:34:41.142 --> 01:34:44.078

INCLUDING WHEELCHAIRS AND OXYGEN

01:34:45.913 --> 01:34:47.648
EQUIPMENT, AND ALSO EXTENSIVE

01:34:47.715 --> 01:34:49.316
FERTILITY COVERAGE FOR IVF.

01:34:49.383 --> 01:34:50.618
HEALTH ACCESS APPRECIATES THE

01:34:50.684 --> 01:34:51.786
CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF THE

01:34:51.852 --> 01:34:53.587
FULL RANGE OF BENEFITS TO

01:34:53.654 --> 01:34:55.556

01:36:59.813 --> 01:37:01.982
NUMBER 11, WHICH WITH REGARDS TO

01:37:02.049 --> 01:37:03.450
HEALTH FACILITIES AND

01:37:03.517 --> 01:37:05.252
ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES, GREAT.

01:37:05.319 --> 01:37:08.989
THANK YOU. SB 596 I WANT TO MAKE

01:37:09.056 --> 01:37:11.692
SURE WE ALL ARE ON THE SAME PAGE

01:37:11.759 --> 01:37:12.826
IN TERMS OF CURRENTLY IN STATE

01:37:12.893 --> 01:37:15.596
LAW. THIS BODY HAS PASSED

01:37:15.663 --> 01:37:17.398
NURSING RATIOS, SO MY BILL DOES

01:37:17.464 --> 01:37:19.633
NOT ESTABLISH NEW NURSING

01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:22.469
RATIOS. IT'S BEEN IN LAW SINCE

01:37:22.536 --> 01:37:26.140
2019 THAT THIS BODY HAS APPROVED

01:37:26.207 --> 01:37:28.008
ESTABLISHED SPECIFIC FINES FOR

01:37:28.075 --> 01:37:29.944
NURSE RATIO VIOLATIONS. MY BILL

01:37:30.010 --> 01:37:33.681
DOES NOT TOUCH, ESTABLISH,

01:37:33.747 --> 01:37:35.449
REESTABLISH, INCREASE ANY FINES

01:37:35.516 --> 01:37:37.952
ON NURSE PATIENT RATIO

01:37:38.018 --> 01:37:38.786
VIOLATIONS. HOWEVER, WHEN THE

01:37:38.852 --> 01:37:40.454
BILL WAS PASSED TO ESTABLISH

01:37:40.521 --> 01:37:42.389
THESE NURSE RATIOS, IT ALLOWED

01:37:42.456 --> 01:37:44.425
AN OFF RAMP OR A WAIVER, IF YOU

01:37:44.491 --> 01:37:46.627
WILL, FOR HOSPITALS TO SAY I

01:37:46.694 --> 01:37:48.829
MIGHT BE CAUGHT IN A VIOLATION.

01:37:48.896 --> 01:37:50.864
HOWEVER, DON'T FIND ME BECAUSE I

01:37:50.931 --> 01:37:53.067
CALLED AN ON CALL LIST. SO THE

01:37:53.133 --> 01:37:54.568
ON CALL LIST IS NOT A NEW

01:37:54.635 --> 01:37:55.936
PHENOMENON THAT IS BEING

01:37:56.003 --> 01:37:58.138
INTRODUCED BY SB 596. THAT'S

01:37:58.205 --> 01:38:00.641
ALREADY IN STATUTE RIGHT NOW.

01:38:00.708 --> 01:38:02.142
HOWEVER, THE BILL THAT PASSED IN

01:38:02.209 --> 01:38:03.611
SAYING YOU HAVE TO CALL AN ON

01:38:03.677 --> 01:38:05.746
CALL LIST AND NOT DEFINE WHAT

01:38:05.813 --> 01:38:06.814
THAT IS, YOU CAN HAVE A

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:08.916
DIFFERENT DEFINITION. I CAN HAVE

01:38:08.983 --> 01:38:09.683
A DIFFERENT DEFINITION. ONE

01:38:09.750 --> 01:38:10.784
HOSPITAL CAN SAY, WELL, MY

01:38:10.851 --> 01:38:11.885
ONCOLOGIST IS CALLING MY

01:38:11.952 --> 01:38:13.554
BROTHER. I CALL MY BROTHER. IT'S

01:38:13.621 --> 01:38:14.922
NOT EVEN A NURSE. BUT I CALLED

01:38:14.989 --> 01:38:16.457
AN ON CALL LIST. ANOTHER

01:38:16.523 --> 01:38:17.725
HOSPITAL CAN SAY, I'M GOING TO

01:38:17.791 --> 01:38:19.760
CALL NURSE THAT I KNOW IS IN

01:38:19.827 --> 01:38:21.528
GERMANY. I KNOW THEY'RE NOT

01:38:21.595 --> 01:38:23.163
GOING TO BE ABLE TO COME IN AND,

01:38:23.230 --> 01:38:24.398
AND, AND WORK TODAY, BUT I'M

01:38:24.465 --> 01:38:25.766
JUST CALLING. SO THE ORIGINAL

01:38:25.833 --> 01:38:27.801
INTENT OF IT, OR THE INTENT OF

01:38:27.868 --> 01:38:29.670
SB 596, WAS TO DEFINE WHAT AN ON

01:38:29.737 --> 01:38:31.572
CALL LIST IS. ONLY WHEN A

01:38:31.639 --> 01:38:33.107
HOSPITAL SAYS DO NOT FIND ME,

01:38:33.173 --> 01:38:34.942
EVEN THOUGH I WAS CAUGHT IN

01:38:35.009 --> 01:38:37.077
VIOLATION BECAUSE I CALLED AN ON

01:38:37.144 --> 01:38:38.579
CALL LIST. SO WE WANT TO MAKE

01:38:38.646 --> 01:38:40.281
SURE THAT HOSPITALS ARE IN GOOD

01:38:40.347 --> 01:38:42.416
FAITH, PROVIDING AN EFFORT TO

01:38:42.483 --> 01:38:43.717
AVOID THAT FINDING. ACTUALLY

01:38:43.784 --> 01:38:45.352
CALLING INDIVIDUALS. THE

01:38:45.419 --> 01:38:46.787
ORIGINAL PRIOR VERSION OF THIS

01:38:46.854 --> 01:38:48.555
HAD A DEFINITION OF THE ON CALL

01:38:48.622 --> 01:38:50.791
LIST TO INCLUDE 10% OF THE

01:38:50.858 --> 01:38:52.893
PEOPLE OF THE NURSES COMING TO

01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:53.927
WORK, AND THROUGHOUT THIS

01:38:53.994 --> 01:38:55.129
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS, WE HEARD

01:38:55.195 --> 01:38:56.997
LOUD AND CLEAR THAT THE 10% WAS

01:38:57.064 --> 01:38:59.233
A HEARTBURN FOR HOSPITALS AND WE

01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:00.367
COULDN'T LAND ON WHAT REALLY

01:39:00.434 --> 01:39:02.403
THAT 10% LOOKED LIKE, AND THEY

01:39:02.469 --> 01:39:03.971
WANTED MORE FLEXIBILITY. SO WHAT

01:39:04.038 --> 01:39:05.806
YOU SEE IN FRONT OF YOU NOW IS

01:39:05.873 --> 01:39:07.641
THE REMOVAL OF THE 10% TO

01:39:07.708 --> 01:39:09.977
PROVIDE EVEN MORE FLEXIBILITY

01:39:10.044 --> 01:39:13.414
TO, TO HOSPITALS, TO CLAIM THAT

01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:15.149
THEY'RE USING AN ON CALL LIST.

01:39:15.215 --> 01:39:18.719
NOW, WITHIN THIS, THIS SPACE,

01:39:18.786 --> 01:39:20.321
HOSPITALS STILL HAVE THE

01:39:20.387 --> 01:39:22.089
FLEXIBILITY TO USE ANY TYPE OF

01:39:22.156 --> 01:39:24.124
APPROACH THEY MAY USE TO GET

01:39:24.191 --> 01:39:25.693
PEOPLE TO COME AND FILL THEIR

01:39:25.759 --> 01:39:27.695
SPACES. IF YOUR HOSPITAL HAS A

01:39:27.761 --> 01:39:29.963
FLEX POOL, USE A FLEX POOL. IF

01:39:30.030 --> 01:39:32.132
YOUR HOSPITAL AUTOMATICALLY

01:39:32.199 --> 01:39:33.934
BRINGS IN NURSES AND PUTS THEM

01:39:34.001 --> 01:39:35.736
ON A SHIFT BECAUSE THEY KNOW

01:39:35.803 --> 01:39:36.603
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE PEOPLE

01:39:36.670 --> 01:39:38.739
CALL OUT, USE THAT SYSTEM. THIS

01:39:38.806 --> 01:39:41.108
BILL DOES NOT REMOVE THE

01:39:41.175 --> 01:39:42.843
FLEXIBILITY OF HOSPITALS TO USE

01:39:42.910 --> 01:39:45.045
ANY KIND OF SYSTEM. THEY MAY

01:39:45.112 --> 01:39:46.380
NEED TO FILL AND MEET THE NURSE

01:39:46.447 --> 01:39:48.582
PATIENT RATIO. HOWEVER, THIS

01:39:48.649 --> 01:39:52.219
BILL WILL ONLY KICK IN WHEN CDPH

01:39:52.286 --> 01:39:54.021
COME, COMES AND FINDS A HOSPITAL

01:39:54.088 --> 01:39:55.956
IN VIOLATION OF THE RATIOS, AND

01:39:56.023 --> 01:39:57.958
THE HOSPITAL WANTS TO CLAIM A

01:39:58.025 --> 01:40:00.160
WAIVER. AGAIN, THIS BILL ONLY

01:40:00.227 --> 01:40:02.730
KICKS IN ONLY WHEN A HOSPITAL IS

01:40:02.796 --> 01:40:05.532
SAYING DON'T FIND ME. I USED AN

01:40:05.599 --> 01:40:09.236
ON CALL LIST. I RECOGNIZE THAT

01:40:09.303 --> 01:40:11.572
THE OPPOSITION STILL IS WAS NOT

01:40:11.638 --> 01:40:13.807
ABLE TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS,

01:40:13.874 --> 01:40:17.378
BUT IN GOOD FAITH I. I ACCEPTED

01:40:17.444 --> 01:40:19.146
AMENDMENTS WITH THE INFORMATION

01:40:19.213 --> 01:40:20.614
I WAS GIVEN. THE INFORMATION I

01:40:20.681 --> 01:40:22.616
WAS GIVEN IS THAT THE 10% IS TOO

01:40:22.683 --> 01:40:24.618
HARD FOR US. WE CAN'T DEFINE IT.

01:40:24.685 --> 01:40:26.387
SO AFTER REMOVING THAT, IT'S A

01:40:26.453 --> 01:40:28.222
LITTLE RESPECTFULLY DIFFICULT TO

01:40:28.288 --> 01:40:29.990
CONTINUE IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS.

01:40:30.057 --> 01:40:31.458
IF I GAVE THE OPPOSITION WHAT

01:40:31.525 --> 01:40:32.860
THEY WANTED AND THEN THEY'RE

01:40:32.926 --> 01:40:34.628
STILL OPPOSED TO THIS. HOSPITALS

01:40:34.695 --> 01:40:35.963
HAVE LOTS OF OPTIONS TO AVOID

01:40:36.029 --> 01:40:37.631
BEING SHORT STAFFED. SOME

01:40:37.698 --> 01:40:38.665
HOSPITALS CONTRACT WITH NURSE

01:40:38.732 --> 01:40:40.100
STAFFING AGENCIES. SOME SCHEDULE

01:40:40.167 --> 01:40:41.735
IN A WAY THAT MAKES BEING SHORT

01:40:41.802 --> 01:40:43.270
STAFFED UNLIKELY IN SOME UNITS

01:40:43.337 --> 01:40:45.139
AND USES, LIKE I MENTIONED, A

01:40:45.205 --> 01:40:46.707
FLOAT POOL. BUT WHAT WE DON'T

01:40:46.774 --> 01:40:49.176
WANT TO DO IS HAVE HOSPITALS

01:40:49.243 --> 01:40:50.244
CALL PEOPLE THAT THEY NEVER

01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:52.079
INTENDED TO SHOW UP. YOU WANT TO

01:40:52.146 --> 01:40:53.447
KNOW THAT YOU'RE ON CALL. YOU

01:40:53.514 --> 01:40:54.748
WANT TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE

01:40:54.815 --> 01:40:56.350
SCHEDULED TO BE ON CALL, THAT

01:40:56.417 --> 01:40:57.785
YOU'RE AVAILABLE AT A CAUSE

01:40:57.851 --> 01:40:58.852
NOTICE TO COME IN. I WANT TO

01:40:58.919 --> 01:41:01.288
KNOW IF I CAN'T GO TO GERMANY OR

01:41:01.355 --> 01:41:03.257
ZURICH DURING MY OFF DAYS

01:41:03.323 --> 01:41:04.958
BECAUSE I'M ON CALL OR NOT. IF

01:41:05.025 --> 01:41:06.760
NOT, WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO

01:41:06.827 --> 01:41:08.862
PUT OUR OUR CONSUMER, OUR

01:41:08.929 --> 01:41:11.765
PATIENTS RIGHT TO EQUITABLE AND,

01:41:11.832 --> 01:41:17.137
AND RIGHT CARE BEHIND AND NOT IN

01:41:17.204 --> 01:41:19.773
FRONT OF THE HOSPITALS NEEDS

01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:21.575
RIGHT NOW. NOW, I RECOGNIZE THAT

01:41:21.642 --> 01:41:23.310
THIS IS COMING AT A TIME WHERE,

01:41:23.377 --> 01:41:25.646
YOU KNOW, THE BIG UGLY BILL JUST

01:41:25.712 --> 01:41:26.880
GOT PASSED AND SO FORTH, AND

01:41:26.947 --> 01:41:28.015
MEDI-CAL IS GOING TO BE

01:41:28.081 --> 01:41:28.715
IMPACTING OUR HOSPITALS. BUT

01:41:28.782 --> 01:41:30.217
THIS IS AN EXTRA BURDEN.

01:41:30.284 --> 01:41:31.518
HOSPITALS HAVE TO MEET THOSE

01:41:31.585 --> 01:41:33.387
RATIOS. RIGHT NOW. THIS BILL

01:41:33.454 --> 01:41:35.489
DOES NOT SAY YOU HAVE TO DO NEW

01:41:35.556 --> 01:41:36.824
DIFFERENT RATIOS. THEY HAVE TO

01:41:36.890 --> 01:41:38.125
MEET THAT RIGHT NOW, HOSPITALS

01:41:38.192 --> 01:41:39.593
GET FINED. RIGHT NOW MY BILL

01:41:39.660 --> 01:41:40.994
DOES NOT INCREASE THAT. BUT OF

01:41:41.061 --> 01:41:43.497
THE 400 HOSPITALS THAT EXIST IN

01:41:43.564 --> 01:41:45.833
CALIFORNIA, ONLY 32 HOSPITALS

01:41:45.899 --> 01:41:48.135
HAVE EVER BEEN FOUND IN

01:41:48.202 --> 01:41:51.371
VIOLATION SINCE 2020, IF I'M NOT

01:41:51.438 --> 01:41:53.640
MISTAKEN, IN FOUR YEARS, ONLY 32

01:41:53.707 --> 01:41:56.109
AND CDPH OR ANY DEPARTMENT

01:41:56.176 --> 01:41:57.611
DOESN'T COME WITH A HEAVY HAND

01:41:57.678 --> 01:42:00.013
ON VIOLATIONS OF THOSE 32

01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:01.281
HOSPITALS. IF ONE OF THOSE SAID

01:42:01.348 --> 01:42:03.016
WE WANT TO BE EXCLUDED FROM

01:42:03.083 --> 01:42:04.651
THAT, FINE, THEY WOULD HAVE HAD

01:42:04.718 --> 01:42:06.587
TO DEAL WITH THIS BILL THAT THEY

01:42:06.653 --> 01:42:08.655
HAD AN ON CALL LIST. I'VE

01:42:08.722 --> 01:42:10.390
RAMBLED ENOUGH, MADAM CHAIR. SO

01:42:10.457 --> 01:42:12.559
I'M NOW GOING TO TURN TO MY

01:42:12.626 --> 01:42:15.128
WITNESS TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT.

01:42:15.195 --> 01:42:18.499
THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON, CHAIR

01:42:18.565 --> 01:42:19.933
AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.369
NAME IS ANNA BERGERON. I AM A

01:42:22.436 --> 01:42:23.937
REGISTERED NURSE AND A MEMBER OF

01:42:24.004 --> 01:42:26.006
THE UNITED NURSES ASSOCIATION OF

01:42:26.073 --> 01:42:27.341
CALIFORNIA UNION OF HEALTHCARE

01:42:27.407 --> 01:42:28.575
PROFESSIONALS. I'VE BEEN A NURSE

01:42:28.642 --> 01:42:30.577
FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS, AND I

01:42:30.644 --> 01:42:33.113
CAN'T REMEMBER A TIME WHEN NURSE

01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:33.814
PATIENT RATIOS HAVE BEEN

01:42:33.881 --> 01:42:36.049
CONSISTENTLY OR MEANINGFULLY,

01:42:36.116 --> 01:42:38.919
MEANINGFULLY ENFORCED. SB 596

01:42:38.986 --> 01:42:40.687
CLOSES A LOOPHOLE THAT EXISTED

01:42:40.754 --> 01:42:42.155
FOR YEARS, A LOOPHOLE THAT

01:42:42.222 --> 01:42:44.391
HOSPITALS HAVE EXPLOITED TO

01:42:44.458 --> 01:42:45.325
BYPASS NURSE STAFFING

01:42:45.392 --> 01:42:46.827
REGULATIONS WITHOUT

01:42:46.894 --> 01:42:48.262
CONSEQUENCES. I HAVE WORKED SO

01:42:48.328 --> 01:42:49.763
MANY SHIFTS WHERE THE STAFFING

01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:51.565
HAS BEEN SHORT, AND I HAVE

01:42:51.632 --> 01:42:52.900
REPORTED THE ISSUE TO THE

01:42:52.966 --> 01:42:54.801
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH, AND

01:42:54.868 --> 01:42:56.169
RARELY HAVE THERE BEEN ANY

01:42:56.236 --> 01:42:58.672
PENALTIES FOR UNSAFE STAFFING.

01:42:58.739 --> 01:43:02.075
SB FIVE 9596 BRINGS LONG OVERDUE

01:43:02.142 --> 01:43:03.377
ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS BY

01:43:03.443 --> 01:43:04.845
REQUIRING TIMELY INVESTIGATIONS

01:43:04.912 --> 01:43:06.213
OF STAFFING COMPLAINTS AND

01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:08.315
TREATING EACH DAY A VIOLATION

01:43:08.382 --> 01:43:10.918
OCCURS AS A SEPARATE INCIDENT.

01:43:10.984 --> 01:43:13.086
THE BILL ENSURES THAT REPEATED

01:43:13.153 --> 01:43:14.254
UNDERSTAFFING IS NO LONGER

01:43:14.321 --> 01:43:17.090
TREATED AS ONE TIME EVENT.

01:43:17.157 --> 01:43:19.560
CRITICALLY. SB 596 ALSO TIGHTENS

01:43:19.626 --> 01:43:21.528
WHAT IT MEANS FOR A HOSPITAL TO

01:43:21.595 --> 01:43:22.629
CLAIM THAT THEY'VE EXHAUSTED

01:43:22.696 --> 01:43:25.132
THEIR ON CALL LIST. I'VE SEEN

01:43:25.198 --> 01:43:26.767
HOSPITALS CLAIM COMPLIANCE WHILE

01:43:26.833 --> 01:43:28.602
NEVER TRULY CALLING A QUALIFIED

01:43:28.669 --> 01:43:31.038
NURSE OR FLOAT POOL STAFF. THIS

01:43:31.104 --> 01:43:32.539
BILL MAKES THAT TACTIC MUCH

01:43:32.606 --> 01:43:34.341
HARDER TO JUSTIFY BY REQUIRING

01:43:34.408 --> 01:43:37.978
REAL DOCUMENTATION, REAL ON CALL

01:43:38.045 --> 01:43:39.780
STAFF, AND VERIFIED COMPETENCIES

01:43:39.846 --> 01:43:41.448
FOR THOSE EXPECTED TO FLOAT WHEN

01:43:41.515 --> 01:43:44.017
RATIOS ARE VIOLATED, PATIENTS

01:43:44.084 --> 01:43:46.887
SUFFER, NURSES BURN OUT, AND THE

01:43:46.954 --> 01:43:49.056
PROMISE OF SAFE, HIGH QUALITY

01:43:49.122 --> 01:43:51.925
CARE BECOMES AN EMPTY PROMISE.

01:43:51.992 --> 01:43:54.461
SB 596 IS A PRACTICAL STEP

01:43:54.528 --> 01:43:56.330
FORWARD NOT JUST FOR NURSES, BUT

01:43:56.396 --> 01:43:57.931
FOR EVERY PATIENT IN CALIFORNIA.

01:43:57.998 --> 01:44:00.100
I RESPECTFULLY URGE FOR YOUR

01:44:00.167 --> 01:44:03.503
SUPPORT. THANK YOU. YOU'LL HAVE

01:44:03.570 --> 01:44:05.505
TWO MINUTES. GOOD AFTERNOON. THE

01:44:05.572 --> 01:44:07.774
PROUD CO-SPONSOR WITH SEIU, THE

01:44:07.841 --> 01:44:10.978
PROUD CO-SPONSOR OF SB 596. I

01:44:11.044 --> 01:44:12.446
APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE AND THE

01:44:12.512 --> 01:44:14.915
STAFF AND THE ANALYSIS ON THE

01:44:14.982 --> 01:44:17.184
BILL. I THINK, AS HAS BEEN

01:44:17.250 --> 01:44:18.018
MENTIONED ON CALL LISTS ARE NOT

01:44:18.085 --> 01:44:21.088
A NEW THING. WHAT HAVE WE HAVE

01:44:21.154 --> 01:44:24.992
SEEN SINCE THE ENACTMENT OF SB

01:44:25.058 --> 01:44:26.293
227 IN 2019? IS THAT THIS ON

01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:28.195
CALL LIST PROCEDURE COULD USE

01:44:28.261 --> 01:44:29.896
SOME TIGHTENING UP. AND THIS IS

01:44:29.963 --> 01:44:31.698
WHAT THIS BILL SEEKS TO DO. WHAT

01:44:31.765 --> 01:44:33.634
WE HAVE SEEN IN SOME HOSPITALS

01:44:33.700 --> 01:44:35.002
PRACTICE IS JUST TEXTING A

01:44:35.068 --> 01:44:37.504
COUPLE PEOPLE AND ACTUALLY NOT

01:44:37.571 --> 01:44:39.806
HAVING NURSES WHO ARE AWARE OR

01:44:39.873 --> 01:44:42.009
EVEN AVAILABLE TO COME IN TO

01:44:42.075 --> 01:44:43.777
WORK BEING NOTIFIED. AND

01:44:43.844 --> 01:44:44.911
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT PUTS A

01:44:44.978 --> 01:44:45.912
SIGNIFICANT BURDEN ON THE NURSES

01:44:45.979 --> 01:44:48.081
WHO ARE ON THE FRONT LINE. AND

01:44:48.148 --> 01:44:49.416
THE REAL DIFFICULT THING ABOUT

01:44:49.483 --> 01:44:50.784
THAT IS THOSE NURSES WHO MAY

01:44:50.851 --> 01:44:53.387
HAVE TOO MANY PATIENTS. IF

01:44:53.453 --> 01:44:54.521
SOMETHING UNFORTUNATE WOULD

01:44:54.588 --> 01:44:56.523
HAPPEN TO THOSE PATIENTS BECAUSE

01:44:56.590 --> 01:44:57.758
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH COVERAGE

01:44:57.824 --> 01:44:59.493
THERE, THE FACT THEY'RE OUT OF

01:44:59.559 --> 01:45:01.628
RATIO IS NOT A DEFENSE. WHEN

01:45:01.695 --> 01:45:03.897
THEY GO TO THE BURN AND THEIR

01:45:03.964 --> 01:45:04.631
LICENSE IS AT RISK. SO FOR THE

01:45:04.698 --> 01:45:06.033
NURSES, THIS IS REALLY PUTTING A

01:45:06.099 --> 01:45:07.634
SIGNIFICANT BURDEN ON THEM TO

01:45:07.701 --> 01:45:09.736
TRY TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE CARING

01:45:09.803 --> 01:45:11.004
FOR THEIR PATIENTS, WHILE AT THE

01:45:11.071 --> 01:45:12.806
SAME TIME, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:45:12.873 --> 01:45:14.374
THAT THE STAFFING IS

01:45:14.441 --> 01:45:15.342
APPROPRIATE, THAT OUR PATIENTS

01:45:15.409 --> 01:45:18.078
HAVE WHAT THEY NEED. THERE'S

01:45:18.145 --> 01:45:19.646
BEEN SOME CONVERSATIONS, SOME

01:45:19.713 --> 01:45:20.847
QUESTIONS, AS WE'VE TALKED TO

01:45:20.914 --> 01:45:22.649
MEMBERS AROUND THAT COLLECTIVE

01:45:22.716 --> 01:45:23.483
BARGAINING AGREEMENTS. AND FROM

01:45:23.550 --> 01:45:25.652
OUR VIEW, THIS DOESN'T PROHIBIT

01:45:25.719 --> 01:45:27.320
OR IMPACT THE EXISTING

01:45:27.387 --> 01:45:28.055
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

01:45:28.121 --> 01:45:29.589
AGREEMENTS. IF YOUR DECISION IS

01:45:29.656 --> 01:45:31.625
NOT TO USE ON CALL LIST IN A

01:45:31.692 --> 01:45:32.859
HOSPITAL'S ELECTED TO DO TO DO

01:45:32.926 --> 01:45:34.728
THAT WITHIN THEIR CBA, THIS

01:45:34.795 --> 01:45:37.864
WOULDN'T VIOLATE THAT. SO, YOU

01:45:37.931 --> 01:45:39.166
KNOW, OF COURSE HOSPITALS CAN

01:45:39.232 --> 01:45:40.567
UPDATE THEIR CBAS IF THEY, YOU

01:45:40.634 --> 01:45:42.302
KNOW, AS THE LAW CHANGES AND I'M

01:45:42.369 --> 01:45:43.804
SURE THEY WILL WANT TO HAVE

01:45:43.870 --> 01:45:45.205
THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH THEIR

01:45:45.272 --> 01:45:47.574
LABOR PARTNERS. BUT IF THEY'RE

01:45:47.641 --> 01:45:48.942
PLANNING ON USING ON CALL LIST

01:45:49.009 --> 01:45:51.211
AND THAT'S PROHIBITED WITHIN THE

01:45:51.278 --> 01:45:52.479
CBA, THEN THEY MUST BE STAFFING

01:45:52.546 --> 01:45:53.780
APPROPRIATELY. AS SENATOR

01:45:53.847 --> 01:45:55.849
MENTIONED IN HER OPENING. SO

01:45:55.916 --> 01:45:57.551
HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS IF

01:45:57.617 --> 01:45:58.752
THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS. BUT

01:45:58.819 --> 01:45:59.953
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I

01:46:00.020 --> 01:46:01.421
APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK

01:46:01.488 --> 01:46:03.724
YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHERS IN THE

01:46:03.790 --> 01:46:04.725
ROOM WHO WOULD LIKE TO OFFER A

01:46:04.791 --> 01:46:08.895
ME TWO IN SUPPORT OF SB 596,

01:46:08.962 --> 01:46:25.245
PLEASE COME FORWARD.

01:46:25.312 --> 01:46:26.446
MY NAME IS GUILLERMO MENDOZA

01:46:26.513 --> 01:46:28.281
LUJAN. I'M WITH SEIU, WENT TO.

01:46:28.348 --> 01:46:30.117
I'M A REGISTERED NURSE IN THE

01:46:30.183 --> 01:46:30.917
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. EMERGENCY

01:46:30.984 --> 01:46:34.154
DEPARTMENT AND WE SUPPORT SB

01:46:34.221 --> 01:46:36.723
596. THANK YOU. WE'LL MOVE ON

01:46:36.790 --> 01:46:41.094
NOW TO ANY PRIMARY WITNESSES IN

01:46:41.161 --> 01:46:57.344
OPPOSITION.

01:46:58.478 --> 01:47:00.413
PLEASE GO AHEAD. YOU'LL HAVE TWO

01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:01.148
MINUTES. GOOD AFTERNOON, MADAM

01:47:01.214 --> 01:47:02.749
CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I'M CHRISTY

01:47:02.816 --> 01:47:04.785
WEIS WITH CAPITAL ADVOCACY HERE

01:47:04.851 --> 01:47:06.153
IN OPPOSITION ON BEHALF OF THE

01:47:06.219 --> 01:47:09.356
CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION.

01:47:09.422 --> 01:47:11.057
THIS IS SUCH A CHALLENGING

01:47:11.124 --> 01:47:12.025
CONVERSATION, AND I REALLY

01:47:12.092 --> 01:47:13.760
REGRET TO HEAR SOME OF THE

01:47:13.827 --> 01:47:14.795
COMMENTS THAT THE SENATOR MADE

01:47:14.861 --> 01:47:16.363
IN HER OPENING, BECAUSE, YOU

01:47:16.429 --> 01:47:18.131
KNOW, SCHEDULING NURSES TO MEET

01:47:18.198 --> 01:47:19.966
CALIFORNIA'S NURSE STAFFING

01:47:20.033 --> 01:47:22.002
REQUIREMENTS IS A VERY

01:47:22.068 --> 01:47:23.103
CHALLENGING SITUATION. THE

01:47:23.170 --> 01:47:25.038
HOSPITALS MANAGE EVERY DAY AND

01:47:25.105 --> 01:47:26.473
HAVE SINCE THE ORIGINAL BILL WAS

01:47:26.540 --> 01:47:28.208
SIGNED INTO LAW, I THINK, BY

01:47:28.275 --> 01:47:32.612
GOVERNOR DAVIS, SCHEDULING

01:47:32.679 --> 01:47:37.184
NURSES IS VERY. IT'S A VERY

01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:38.752
SENSITIVE SITUATION THAT

01:47:38.819 --> 01:47:40.587
HOSPITALS HAVE TO MANAGE AT ANY

01:47:40.654 --> 01:47:41.955
GIVEN TIME. IN A HOSPITAL, A

01:47:42.022 --> 01:47:43.690
PATIENT COULD TAKE A TURN FOR

01:47:43.757 --> 01:47:44.825
THE WORSE, SUDDENLY NEEDING MORE

01:47:44.891 --> 01:47:47.294
INTENSE NURSING CARE. THIS WOULD

01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:48.461
IMMEDIATELY INCREASE THE NUMBER

01:47:48.528 --> 01:47:50.964
OF NURSES THAT ARE NEEDED. THE

01:47:51.031 --> 01:47:52.032
HOSPITAL COULD HAVE AN

01:47:52.098 --> 01:47:53.934
UNEXPECTED SURGE OF PATIENTS

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.702
REQUIRING MORE NURSES THAN WERE

01:47:55.769 --> 01:47:57.838
PLANNED. MANY OF OUR HOSPITALS

01:47:57.904 --> 01:47:59.639
OVER STAFF TO ENSURE THAT THEY

01:47:59.706 --> 01:48:01.308
MEET THE RATIO AND CAN MANAGE AN

01:48:01.374 --> 01:48:04.010
EVER CHANGING PATIENT CENSUS 24

01:48:04.077 --> 01:48:06.646
HOURS A DAY AROUND THE CLOCK.

01:48:06.713 --> 01:48:08.315
HOSPITALS MAINTAIN ON CALL LISTS

01:48:08.381 --> 01:48:10.784
IN VARIOUS WAYS TO MEET THIS

01:48:10.851 --> 01:48:12.252
CHALLENGE, TAILORED TO BEST MEET

01:48:12.319 --> 01:48:14.688
THEIR PATIENTS CARE NEEDS AND

01:48:14.754 --> 01:48:16.656
OPERATIONAL DYNAMICS. THERE IS

01:48:16.723 --> 01:48:19.092
NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL ANSWER FOR

01:48:19.159 --> 01:48:21.228
DEFINING AN ON CALL LIST, NOR

01:48:21.294 --> 01:48:22.229
FOR DETERMINING WHO POPULATES

01:48:22.295 --> 01:48:24.531
THE LIST. AS YOU ALL KNOW, WE

01:48:24.598 --> 01:48:26.633
HAVE A VERY DIVERSE SET OF

01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:27.300
HOSPITALS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA,

01:48:27.367 --> 01:48:28.835
AND THEY NEED FLEXIBILITY TO

01:48:28.902 --> 01:48:30.170
MANAGE THIS IN THE WAY THAT

01:48:30.237 --> 01:48:31.838
WORKS WITH THEIR PATIENTS AND

01:48:31.905 --> 01:48:33.673
THEIR EMPLOYEES. IN MANY CASES,

01:48:33.740 --> 01:48:35.075
AS MATT MENTIONED, A COLLECTIVE

01:48:35.141 --> 01:48:36.943
BARGAINING AGREEMENT DETERMINES

01:48:37.010 --> 01:48:38.979
HOW NURSES CAN BE CALLED IN. IF

01:48:39.045 --> 01:48:40.814
A NURSE IS OUT IN THE HOSPITAL

01:48:40.881 --> 01:48:43.016
COULD BE OUT OF RATIO. WE'VE HAD

01:48:43.083 --> 01:48:43.917
SOME CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

01:48:43.984 --> 01:48:46.219
AUTHOR AND THE SPONSOR ABOUT

01:48:46.286 --> 01:48:47.454
ADDRESSING THIS. OFTENTIMES IT

01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:48.955
INCLUDES USING A FLOAT, A FLOAT

01:48:49.022 --> 01:48:51.091
POOL BEFORE USING A SCHEDULED ON

01:48:51.157 --> 01:48:54.527
CALL NURSE. SB 596 WOULD IMPOSE

01:48:54.594 --> 01:48:56.496
NEW REQUIREMENTS ON HOSPITALS ON

01:48:56.563 --> 01:48:58.298
CALL NURSE STAFFING LISTS. AND

01:48:58.365 --> 01:49:00.000
WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE RECENT

01:49:00.066 --> 01:49:01.401
AMENDMENTS THAT THE SENATOR

01:49:01.468 --> 01:49:04.371
MENTIONED, C.H.A REMAINS IN

01:49:04.437 --> 01:49:06.172
OPPOSITION. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS

01:49:06.239 --> 01:49:07.173
PROPOSAL, AS IT'S CURRENTLY

01:49:07.240 --> 01:49:08.775
WRITTEN, WOULD DISRUPT CURRENT

01:49:08.842 --> 01:49:10.810
STAFFING PROCESSES AND INCREASE

01:49:10.877 --> 01:49:12.812
COSTS FOR ALL HOSPITALS WITHOUT

01:49:12.879 --> 01:49:15.448
IMPROVING PATIENT CARE.

01:49:15.515 --> 01:49:16.616
EFFECTIVE PATIENT CARE REQUIRES

01:49:16.683 --> 01:49:18.018
THAT NURSE LEADERS HAVE THE

01:49:18.084 --> 01:49:19.552
FLEXIBILITY TO MAKE REAL TIME

01:49:19.619 --> 01:49:20.987
STAFFING DECISIONS BASED ON

01:49:21.054 --> 01:49:22.322
CONSTANTLY CHANGING CONDITIONS

01:49:22.389 --> 01:49:23.857
WITHIN A HOSPITAL, SUCH AS

01:49:23.924 --> 01:49:26.426
CHANGING PATIENT ACUITY LEVELS,

01:49:26.493 --> 01:49:27.694
EMERGENCIES THAT CAUSE A SURGE

01:49:27.761 --> 01:49:28.995
IN PATIENTS, OR OTHER

01:49:29.062 --> 01:49:30.630
OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES. BEYOND

01:49:30.697 --> 01:49:32.065
THE OPERATIONAL AND

01:49:32.132 --> 01:49:33.133
IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES, THIS

01:49:33.199 --> 01:49:34.668
BILL WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY

01:49:34.734 --> 01:49:36.369
INCREASE THE COST OF CARE AT A

01:49:36.436 --> 01:49:38.238
TIME WHEN CALIFORNIA'S HOSPITALS

01:49:38.305 --> 01:49:40.540
CAN LEAST AFFORD IT. I HAVE

01:49:40.607 --> 01:49:41.608
ERICA FRANK WITH ME, WHO IS

01:49:41.675 --> 01:49:44.411
LEGAL COUNSEL AT CHA, TO ANSWER

01:49:44.477 --> 01:49:45.078
ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS, AND WE

01:49:45.145 --> 01:49:46.579
REMAIN IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION.

01:49:46.646 --> 01:49:50.417
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. ARE THERE

01:49:50.483 --> 01:49:52.485
OTHERS IN OPPOSITION WHO WOULD

01:49:52.552 --> 01:49:54.487
LIKE TO OFFER A. ME TOO. PLEASE

01:49:54.554 --> 01:49:59.993

YOU. SEEING NO OTHER OPPOSITION,

01:50:17.944 --> 01:50:20.013
I WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE

BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND

FOR YOUR WORK WITH THE

OPPOSITION, YOUR EARNEST WORK

01:50:32.258 --> 01:50:33.560
WITH THE OPPOSITION TO TRY TO

01:50:33.626 --> 01:50:36.062
FIND SOME COMPROMISES. I HAVE A

01:50:36.129 --> 01:50:37.063
COUPLE OF BASIC QUESTIONS AS I'M

01:50:37.130 --> 01:50:39.265
LEARNING THIS WHOLE PROCESS. ONE

01:50:39.332 --> 01:50:42.702
IS THAT IN EXISTING LAW, THE

01:50:42.769 --> 01:50:44.838
THERE ARE FEES AND PENALTIES.

01:50:44.904 --> 01:50:46.106
WHERE DO THOSE FEES AND

01:50:46.172 --> 01:50:48.475
PENALTIES GO? WHAT SYSTEMS ARE

01:50:48.541 --> 01:50:51.411
THEY USED TO IMPROVE? I FEEL

01:50:51.478 --> 01:50:52.812
LIKE I SHOULD KNOW THIS SINCE I

01:50:52.879 --> 01:50:54.647
SIT ON SUB THREE. I DON'T KNOW

01:50:54.714 --> 01:50:55.882
IF IT'S SELF-FULFILLING THE

01:50:55.949 --> 01:50:58.018
ACTUAL TO ACTUALLY RUN THE

01:50:58.084 --> 01:50:59.786
PROGRAM, IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, TO

01:50:59.853 --> 01:51:00.954
ACTUALLY RUN THE PROGRAM TO SEND

01:51:01.021 --> 01:51:02.889
OUT INVESTIGATORS, IF THAT'S AS

01:51:02.956 --> 01:51:06.826
FAR AS I REMEMBER THAT THAT'S

01:51:06.893 --> 01:51:08.128
CORRECT. IT GOES TO THE TO THE

01:51:08.194 --> 01:51:10.597
QUALITY, THE CENTER FOR QUALITY

01:51:10.663 --> 01:51:12.499
AND IMPROVEMENT, THE LICENSING

01:51:12.565 --> 01:51:13.600
AND CERTIFICATION FUNDS SO THEY

01:51:13.666 --> 01:51:15.468
CAN RUN ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S. SO

01:51:15.535 --> 01:51:16.669
THEN THAT WOULD HELP. CERTAINLY

01:51:16.736 --> 01:51:17.904
IF MORE FEES WERE COMING IN,

01:51:17.971 --> 01:51:19.706
THAT WOULD HELP WITH MORE

01:51:19.773 --> 01:51:20.340
ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT AND

01:51:20.407 --> 01:51:22.308
MAKE SURE THAT THE PROGRAM IS

01:51:22.375 --> 01:51:24.444
WORKING AS IT'S EXPECTED TO

01:51:24.511 --> 01:51:25.745
WORK, EVEN THOUGH THERE MAY BE

01:51:25.812 --> 01:51:28.715
MORE WORK INVOLVED IN THAT.

01:51:28.782 --> 01:51:30.517
THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW. SECOND

01:51:30.583 --> 01:51:32.385
QUESTION IS I'M TRYING TO

01:51:32.452 --> 01:51:37.757
UNDERSTAND THE LABOR NEGOTIATED

01:51:37.824 --> 01:51:40.627
ON CALL LIST VERSUS THE FLOAT

01:51:40.693 --> 01:51:43.430
POOL RIGHT NOW, AS I UNDERSTAND,

01:51:43.496 --> 01:51:45.632
ALL HOSPITALS, HEALTHCARE

01:51:45.698 --> 01:51:47.801
SYSTEMS GET TO NEGOTIATE THAT

01:51:47.867 --> 01:51:50.103
SYSTEM INDIVIDUALLY. AND THIS

01:51:50.170 --> 01:51:52.572
BILL WOULD NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES

01:51:52.639 --> 01:51:53.973
TO HOW THAT OPERATES. IS THAT

01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:55.175
CORRECT? THAT IS CORRECT. MY

01:51:55.241 --> 01:51:56.576
BILL DOES NOT TOUCH HOW ANY

01:51:56.643 --> 01:51:58.745
HOSPITAL HAS TO MEET THE 2019

01:51:58.812 --> 01:52:01.081
PASSED LEGISLATION ON THEM

01:52:01.147 --> 01:52:02.248
REQUIRED TO MEET THAT NURSE

01:52:02.315 --> 01:52:03.483
PATIENT RATIO. THEY STILL HAVE

01:52:03.550 --> 01:52:05.251
TO REQUIRE TO MEET THAT, AND

01:52:05.318 --> 01:52:06.486
THEY CAN USE WHATEVER TOOL THEY

01:52:06.553 --> 01:52:07.887
CAN THEY WANT TO USE TO MEET

01:52:07.954 --> 01:52:10.457
THOSE RATIOS. OKAY. AND THEN FOR

01:52:10.523 --> 01:52:12.792
THE LAST QUESTION, AS I'M JUST

01:52:12.859 --> 01:52:14.360
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS

01:52:14.427 --> 01:52:16.629
WHEN WE HAVE AN ON CALL LIST AND

01:52:16.696 --> 01:52:18.565
MAYBE THE OPPOSITION CAN ALSO

01:52:18.631 --> 01:52:21.167
PROVIDE SOME INPUT HERE, IT'S MY

01:52:21.234 --> 01:52:22.769
UNDERSTANDING THAT WHOEVER IS ON

01:52:22.836 --> 01:52:25.738
THE ON CALL LIST IS COMPENSATED

01:52:25.805 --> 01:52:28.341
IN SOME WAY FOR HAVING TO BE ON

01:52:28.408 --> 01:52:30.343
CALL, AND A HOSPITAL SYSTEM CAN

01:52:30.410 --> 01:52:32.512
USE A FLOAT LIST FIRST WHERE THE

01:52:32.579 --> 01:52:33.613
EMPLOYEE IS WORKING, MAYBE IN A

01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:34.981
DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT, MAYBE

01:52:35.048 --> 01:52:36.516
OVERSTAFFED IN A CERTAIN AREA

01:52:36.583 --> 01:52:39.319
AND AVAILABLE TO SWITCH OVER SO

01:52:39.385 --> 01:52:40.520
THEY HAVE THOSE STRATEGIES

01:52:40.587 --> 01:52:41.955
AVAILABLE TO THEM. BUT THE ON

01:52:42.021 --> 01:52:43.957
CALL LIST IS A SEPARATE THING,

01:52:44.023 --> 01:52:45.091
WHERE THEY ARE COMPENSATED FOR

01:52:45.158 --> 01:52:47.527
HAVING TO WAIT AND BE READY TO

01:52:47.594 --> 01:52:49.429
JUMP IN THEIR CAR AND RUSH OVER

01:52:49.496 --> 01:52:51.931
TO FULFILL A VACANCY OR AN

01:52:51.998 --> 01:52:52.899
ABSENCE. I'D LIKE TO GO FIRST

01:52:52.966 --> 01:52:54.534
AND THEN TURN OVER TO THE

01:52:54.601 --> 01:52:55.902
OPPOSITION ON ON YOUR QUESTION

01:52:55.969 --> 01:52:58.037
HERE. PLEASE DO SO. IT TIES IN

01:52:58.104 --> 01:52:59.005
TO YOUR SECOND QUESTION, WHERE

01:52:59.072 --> 01:53:00.907
THE HOSPITAL HAS ANY FLEXIBILITY

01:53:00.974 --> 01:53:03.076
TO MEET THE NURSE PATIENT RATIO

01:53:03.143 --> 01:53:06.346
BY LAW. HOWEVER, THE LAW SAYS

01:53:06.412 --> 01:53:08.515
THE LAW ONLY REFERS TO ON CALL

01:53:08.581 --> 01:53:11.384
LISTS AS A GET OUT OF JAIL FREE

01:53:11.451 --> 01:53:12.385
CARD. MEANING IF YOU'RE CAUGHT

01:53:12.452 --> 01:53:14.854
IN VIOLATION, YOUR ONLY ABILITY

01:53:14.921 --> 01:53:16.422
TO WAIVE THE FINE IS TO SAY THAT

01:53:16.489 --> 01:53:19.259
YOU CONTACTED AN ON CALL LIST

01:53:19.325 --> 01:53:20.927
THAT'S IN STATUTE RIGHT NOW. IT

01:53:20.994 --> 01:53:22.862
DOES NOT SAY THAT YOU HAD A FLOW

01:53:22.929 --> 01:53:24.430
POOL. THEY SAY YOU CONTACTED AN

01:53:24.497 --> 01:53:27.433
ON CALL LIST, CORRECT? SO FAR.

01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:29.269
SO BECAUSE THAT'S IN STATUTE

01:53:29.335 --> 01:53:30.436
RIGHT NOW. WHILE THERE'S

01:53:30.503 --> 01:53:31.471
FLEXIBILITY HOW TO MEET THE

01:53:31.538 --> 01:53:33.740
RATIOS, THE ONLY WAY FOR YOU TO

01:53:33.806 --> 01:53:35.108
AVOID A PENALTY IS THAT YOU USE

01:53:35.175 --> 01:53:37.310
AN ON CALL LIST. NOW, SINCE

01:53:37.377 --> 01:53:39.045
THAT'S ALREADY IN STATUTE AS YOU

01:53:39.112 --> 01:53:41.814
ONLY ABILITY TO AVOID A PENALTY,

01:53:41.881 --> 01:53:44.050
THEN BY DEFAULT YOU SHOULD HAVE

01:53:44.117 --> 01:53:46.052
AN ON CALL LIST ONLY IF YOU

01:53:46.119 --> 01:53:47.587
THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN

01:53:47.654 --> 01:53:48.588
VIOLATION, AND YOU WANT TO BE

01:53:48.655 --> 01:53:50.623
ABLE TO PROVE THAT YOU USED AN

01:53:50.690 --> 01:53:52.458
ON CALL LIST. YES, LABOR LAW

01:53:52.525 --> 01:53:54.260
DOES SAY THAT IF YOU SCHEDULE

01:53:54.327 --> 01:53:55.995
PEOPLE IN AN ON CALL LIST, THEY

01:53:56.062 --> 01:53:57.430
SHOULD BE GETTING PAID, BUT YOU

01:53:57.497 --> 01:53:59.532
CAN AVOID THAT IF YOU THINK

01:53:59.599 --> 01:54:01.801
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BE IN

01:54:01.868 --> 01:54:02.569
VIOLATION AND YOU HAVE A FLOAT

01:54:02.635 --> 01:54:03.870
POOL AND SCHEDULE PEOPLE

01:54:03.937 --> 01:54:04.671
REGARDLESS, BECAUSE YOU THINK

01:54:04.737 --> 01:54:06.306
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A HEAVIER,

01:54:06.372 --> 01:54:08.675
HEAVIER CASE TODAY OR THIS

01:54:08.741 --> 01:54:11.377
MONTH, OR BECAUSE OF X, Y, Z.

01:54:11.444 --> 01:54:13.746
THANK YOU. IF I CAN, THANK YOU

01:54:13.813 --> 01:54:14.881
FOR THE QUESTION. ASSEMBLY

01:54:14.948 --> 01:54:16.282
MEMBER. THE RATIO LAWS ARE VERY

01:54:16.349 --> 01:54:17.850
SPECIFIC. A HOSPITAL WORKS VERY

01:54:17.917 --> 01:54:19.686
HARD TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE

01:54:19.752 --> 01:54:21.254
WITH THEM AT ANY TIME, AND THEY

01:54:21.321 --> 01:54:22.722
CAN'T JUST CALL ANY AVAILABLE

01:54:22.789 --> 01:54:24.424
NURSE. THE NURSE HAS TO BE

01:54:24.490 --> 01:54:25.959
APPROPRIATE FOR THE UNIT OF THE

01:54:26.025 --> 01:54:27.227
HOSPITAL, THE ACUITY OF THE

01:54:27.293 --> 01:54:29.028
PATIENTS AND THE SHIFTS THAT

01:54:29.095 --> 01:54:30.163
HAVE TO BE COVERED. AND THE

01:54:30.230 --> 01:54:31.331
RATIOS HAVE DIFFERENT

01:54:31.397 --> 01:54:33.099
REQUIREMENTS, WHETHER IT'S CARE

01:54:33.166 --> 01:54:34.767
IN THE ER, CARE IN THE NICU,

01:54:34.834 --> 01:54:35.935
CARE IN DIFFERENT SETTINGS. SO

01:54:36.002 --> 01:54:38.438
IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS JUST

01:54:38.504 --> 01:54:40.206
CALLING ANY NURSE THAT YOU CAN

01:54:40.273 --> 01:54:41.574
FIND. AND THAT'S WHY THE

01:54:41.641 --> 01:54:43.910
HOSPITALS NEED THIS FLEXIBILITY.

01:54:43.977 --> 01:54:44.844
TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT

01:54:44.911 --> 01:54:45.979
ENFORCEMENT, THE ANALYSIS DOES A

01:54:46.045 --> 01:54:48.982
GREAT JOB ON PAGE FOUR OF

01:54:49.048 --> 01:54:50.550
SPECIFICALLY, YOU KNOW,

01:54:50.617 --> 01:54:52.085
OUTLINING RIGHT, WHAT ACTIONS

01:54:52.151 --> 01:54:55.388
CDF HAS TAKEN. I THINK IT'S

01:54:55.455 --> 01:54:58.958
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE

01:54:59.025 --> 01:55:00.560
HOSPITAL'S PRIMARY OBJECTION

01:55:00.627 --> 01:55:01.694
WITH THE BILL IS IT TAKES AWAY

01:55:01.761 --> 01:55:03.663
THEIR FLEXIBILITY TO MANAGE THE

01:55:03.730 --> 01:55:05.231
CARE FOR THEIR PATIENTS IN THE

01:55:05.298 --> 01:55:06.132
WAY THAT THEY THINK IS

01:55:06.199 --> 01:55:07.467
APPROPRIATE. SO I'M GOING TO

01:55:07.533 --> 01:55:09.469
STOP THERE AND ASK, GIVE ERICA

01:55:09.535 --> 01:55:10.503
THE OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN TO

01:55:10.570 --> 01:55:11.771
ANSWER YOUR QUESTION AS WELL.

01:55:11.838 --> 01:55:13.740
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ON THE

01:55:13.806 --> 01:55:14.674
SPECIFIC QUESTION WITH REGARD TO

01:55:14.741 --> 01:55:15.842
THE MANDATORY THE SCHEDULING OF

01:55:15.908 --> 01:55:17.610
A NURSE ON CALL, YOU ARE

01:55:17.677 --> 01:55:19.379
CORRECT. THAT DOES TRIGGER

01:55:19.445 --> 01:55:22.415
COMPENSATION REQUIREMENTS.

01:55:22.482 --> 01:55:24.517
HOSPITALS, THOUGH, WILL UTILIZE

01:55:24.584 --> 01:55:25.852
THEIR FLOAT POOLS. THEY'LL

01:55:25.918 --> 01:55:28.087
UTILIZE A VOLUNTARY ON CALL LIST

01:55:28.154 --> 01:55:30.089
THAT MAY NOT NECESSARILY HAVE

01:55:30.156 --> 01:55:32.458
THE SAME COMPENSATION

01:55:32.525 --> 01:55:33.593
REQUIREMENTS, BUT ALSO IN MANY

01:55:33.660 --> 01:55:35.962
OF THE CBAS THAT WE HAVE SEEN,

01:55:36.029 --> 01:55:39.365
IF A NURSE IS GOING TO BE ON

01:55:39.432 --> 01:55:40.967
CALL, THEN THEIR STANDBY PAY

01:55:41.034 --> 01:55:42.735
REQUIREMENTS THAT KICK IN WITH

01:55:42.802 --> 01:55:43.936
PREMIUM RATES. AND WE'VE EVEN

01:55:44.003 --> 01:55:46.506
SEEN SOME CBAS THAT ACTUALLY

01:55:46.572 --> 01:55:47.840
RESTRICT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF

01:55:47.907 --> 01:55:49.575
HOURS THAT A NURSE MAY WORK OR

01:55:49.642 --> 01:55:51.978
BE ON CALL. SO THESE ARE SOME OF

01:55:52.045 --> 01:55:53.646
THE CHALLENGES THAT OUR

01:55:53.713 --> 01:55:55.448
HOSPITALS ARE WRANGLING WITH

01:55:55.515 --> 01:55:56.949
WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE

01:55:57.016 --> 01:55:58.484
SPECIFIC LANGUAGE OF THE BILL,

01:55:58.551 --> 01:55:59.886
AND THAT WE'RE NOT ABLE TO

01:55:59.952 --> 01:56:02.021
UTILIZE NURSE STAFFING AGENCIES

01:56:02.088 --> 01:56:04.657
OR AN ON CALL LIST OF NURSES

01:56:04.724 --> 01:56:06.059
THAT WHO ARE VOLUNTARILY MAKING

01:56:06.125 --> 01:56:14.767
THEMSELVES AVAILABLE. THANK YOU.

01:56:14.834 --> 01:56:17.837
ASSEMBLY MEMBER SCHIAVO. THANK

01:56:17.904 --> 01:56:21.074
YOU. AND IN MY FORMER LIFE

01:56:21.140 --> 01:56:22.342
BEFORE BEING HERE, I WORKED WITH

01:56:22.408 --> 01:56:26.746
NURSES A LOT FOR 13 YEARS. AND,

01:56:26.813 --> 01:56:30.983
YOU KNOW, THE RATIO LAW WAS

01:56:31.050 --> 01:56:35.421
REVOLUTIONARY. IT IT REALLY.

01:56:35.488 --> 01:56:37.323
MADE A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE FOR

01:56:37.390 --> 01:56:39.392
NURSES. I'VE WORKED WITH NURSES

01:56:39.459 --> 01:56:40.893
OUTSIDE OF THE STATE AND HEAR

01:56:40.960 --> 01:56:43.096
THE HORROR STORIES OF THEM

01:56:43.162 --> 01:56:46.199
TAKING CARE OF 13, 16, 24

01:56:46.265 --> 01:56:49.102
PATIENTS IN SOME OF THE UNITS,

01:56:49.168 --> 01:56:50.870
AND THEY JUST DREAM ABOUT

01:56:50.937 --> 01:56:53.306
SOMEDAY BEING LIKE CALIFORNIA

01:56:53.373 --> 01:56:55.608
NURSES. BUT CALIFORNIA NURSES

01:56:55.675 --> 01:56:57.744
KNOW THAT. THE REALITY IS THAT

01:56:57.810 --> 01:56:59.479
THEY'RE OFTEN OUT OF RATIO. I

01:56:59.545 --> 01:57:01.814
MEAN, WE YOU KNOW, WHERE I WAS,

01:57:01.881 --> 01:57:04.984
WE HAD A FORM CALLED ASSIGNMENT,

01:57:05.051 --> 01:57:05.952
DESPITE OBJECTION. AND, YOU

01:57:06.018 --> 01:57:10.056
KNOW, AS THE WITNESS MENTIONED,

01:57:10.123 --> 01:57:10.957
NURSES ARE THE ONES WHO CAN BE

01:57:11.023 --> 01:57:13.559
HELD ACCOUNTABLE ON THEIR

01:57:13.626 --> 01:57:15.128
LICENSE. IF SOMETHING HAPPENS IN

01:57:15.194 --> 01:57:16.062
THESE SITUATIONS WHERE THEY'RE

01:57:16.129 --> 01:57:18.965
OUT OF RATIO. AND THIS IS A FORM

01:57:19.031 --> 01:57:21.534
THAT WILL COVER THEM AND TAKE AN

01:57:21.601 --> 01:57:22.635
ASSIGNMENT DESPITE OBJECTION,

01:57:22.702 --> 01:57:24.303
BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE IT'S

01:57:24.370 --> 01:57:26.572
UNSAFE. AND THERE'S BEEN WHOLE

01:57:26.639 --> 01:57:28.541
CAMPAIGNS THAT WE WAGED DAY

01:57:28.608 --> 01:57:30.276
AFTER DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY

01:57:30.343 --> 01:57:32.178
AFTER DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY

01:57:32.245 --> 01:57:35.281
AFTER DAY, WHERE THEY WERE OUT

01:57:35.348 --> 01:57:36.849
OF RATIO. AND SO, YOU KNOW, I

01:57:36.916 --> 01:57:38.551
UNDERSTAND THE EXAMPLES THAT

01:57:38.618 --> 01:57:40.853
WERE GIVEN BY THE OPPOSITION

01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:42.121
THAT SOMETIMES THINGS HAPPEN OUT

01:57:42.188 --> 01:57:43.790
OF YOUR CONTROL. THERE'S A SURGE

01:57:43.856 --> 01:57:45.558
IN THE ER, THERE'S THINGS LIKE

01:57:45.625 --> 01:57:48.027
THAT. BUT THE REALITY FROM WHAT

01:57:48.094 --> 01:57:49.595
I'VE SEEN AND EXPERIENCED IS

01:57:49.662 --> 01:57:56.035
THAT IT'S NORMAL FOR HOSPITALS

01:57:56.102 --> 01:57:58.237
TO UNDERSTAFF ON A REGULAR BASIS

01:57:58.304 --> 01:58:00.406
AS A COST SAVING MEASURE, AND

01:58:00.473 --> 01:58:05.478
IT'S A WAY THAT. YOU KNOW, THAT,

01:58:05.545 --> 01:58:06.879
THAT THE THAT HOSPITALS CAN KIND

01:58:06.946 --> 01:58:09.382
OF CUT CORNERS AND COST SAVE.

01:58:09.449 --> 01:58:11.217
AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S

01:58:11.284 --> 01:58:12.618
OPTIMISTIC THINKING EVERY SINGLE

01:58:12.685 --> 01:58:16.556
DAY OR WHAT. BUT BUT IT YOU

01:58:16.622 --> 01:58:19.459
KNOW, THERE'S SO MANY PUTTING

01:58:19.525 --> 01:58:22.161
ASIDE THE IMPACT TO PATIENTS WHO

01:58:22.228 --> 01:58:24.564
ARE NOT IN THE SAFEST POSSIBLE

01:58:24.630 --> 01:58:25.731
POSITION IN GETTING THE CARE

01:58:25.798 --> 01:58:28.868
THAT THEY NEED AND DESERVE BY

01:58:28.935 --> 01:58:32.071
LAW, BUT IT'S ALSO LEADING TO

01:58:32.138 --> 01:58:34.674
HUGE BURNOUT BY NURSES. YOU

01:58:34.740 --> 01:58:37.210
KNOW, NURSES THAT I TALKED TO,

01:58:37.276 --> 01:58:38.945
WE KNOW NURSES ARE LEAVING THE

01:58:39.011 --> 01:58:39.779
PROFESSION. AND THIS IS ONE OF

01:58:39.846 --> 01:58:41.414
THE HUGE CHALLENGES, IS THAT

01:58:41.481 --> 01:58:44.050
THEY'RE FEELING OVERWHELMED AND

01:58:44.116 --> 01:58:45.918
STRETCHED AND EXHAUSTED AND

01:58:45.985 --> 01:58:47.153
CONSTANTLY UNDERSTAFFED. AND IT

01:58:47.220 --> 01:58:51.224
IS JUST THIS, YOU KNOW, BURDEN

01:58:51.290 --> 01:58:53.626
THAT THEY CAN NEVER GET OUT FROM

01:58:53.693 --> 01:58:58.364
UNDER. AND, YOU KNOW, SO HAVING

01:58:58.431 --> 01:59:00.366
WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE RESOURCES

01:59:00.433 --> 01:59:01.234
AVAILABLE RIGHT, TO

01:59:01.300 --> 01:59:02.502
APPROPRIATELY STAFF TRAVELERS

01:59:02.568 --> 01:59:04.937
ARE USED MORE OFTEN THAN MANY OF

01:59:05.004 --> 01:59:07.373
US WOULD LIKE THEM TO BE USED,

01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:09.208
BUT THEY'RE AN AVAILABLE

01:59:09.275 --> 01:59:10.776
RESOURCE AS WELL FOR A WHOLE LOT

01:59:10.843 --> 01:59:13.079
MORE MONEY THAN JUST HIRING MORE

01:59:13.145 --> 01:59:15.114
STAFF. HIRING MORE STAFF WOULD

01:59:15.181 --> 01:59:18.484
BE ANOTHER WAY TO FULLY STAFF.

01:59:18.551 --> 01:59:21.087
SO, YOU KNOW, SO THERE ARE THERE

01:59:21.153 --> 01:59:24.290
ARE SO MANY WAYS TO ENSURE THAT

01:59:24.357 --> 01:59:27.059
APPROPRIATE STAFFING HAPPENS AND

01:59:27.126 --> 01:59:28.895
MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS A

01:59:28.961 --> 01:59:32.064
REALISTIC ON CALL LIST THAT YOU

01:59:32.131 --> 01:59:37.236
KNOW, THAT THAT IS UTILIZED TO

01:59:37.303 --> 01:59:39.672
EARNESTLY TRY TO STAFF UP WHEN

01:59:39.739 --> 01:59:42.208
UNDERSTAFFING IS HAPPENING. YOU

01:59:42.275 --> 01:59:44.176
KNOW, I THINK IS REALLY KIND OF

01:59:44.243 --> 01:59:48.814
THE LEAST THAT WE CAN DO. AND,

01:59:48.881 --> 01:59:50.516
YOU KNOW, AND, AND JUST, YOU

01:59:50.583 --> 01:59:52.818
KNOW, I JUST I HAVE TO SAY FROM,

01:59:52.885 --> 01:59:54.487
FROM MY EXPERIENCE, IT'S, IT'S

01:59:54.554 --> 01:59:56.422
NOT THE EXCEPTION, IT'S THE NORM

01:59:56.489 --> 01:59:58.357
THAT SHORT STAFFING HAPPENS. AND

01:59:58.424 --> 02:00:02.728
IT REALLY IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING

02:00:02.795 --> 02:00:07.166
TO SEE IT BE ALMOST A POLICY, AN

02:00:07.233 --> 02:00:09.001
UNWRITTEN POLICY FOR HOSPITALS

02:00:09.068 --> 02:00:15.308
TO SHORT STAFF AND, AND CONTINUE

02:00:15.374 --> 02:00:17.443
TO TRY TO GET AROUND WHAT IS

02:00:17.510 --> 02:00:19.245
STATE LAW, WHAT IS THE LAW, WHAT

02:00:19.312 --> 02:00:21.514
IS SAFEST FOR PATIENTS AND THE

02:00:21.581 --> 02:00:23.149
CARE THAT NURSES DESPERATELY

02:00:23.215 --> 02:00:25.017
WANT TO BE PROVIDING TO THEIR

02:00:25.084 --> 02:00:27.954
PATIENTS AS WELL. SO, YOU KNOW,

02:00:28.020 --> 02:00:29.355
I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL

02:00:29.422 --> 02:00:33.292
TODAY. AND I HOPE THAT, YOU

02:00:33.359 --> 02:00:34.860
KNOW, THAT THERE CAN BE SOME

02:00:34.927 --> 02:00:35.695
KIND OF AGREEMENT THAT HAPPENS.

02:00:35.761 --> 02:00:37.997
BUT I THINK THAT IT'S REALLY

02:00:38.064 --> 02:00:39.465
CRITICAL THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT

02:00:39.532 --> 02:00:40.833
THIS LAW THAT WE FOUGHT SO HARD

02:00:40.900 --> 02:00:42.735
FOR IN CALIFORNIA TO MAKE SURE

02:00:42.802 --> 02:00:44.337
THAT THERE'S SAFE STAFFING AND

02:00:44.403 --> 02:00:46.339
SAFE PATIENT CARE, THAT IT IS

02:00:46.405 --> 02:00:48.140
REAL. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HAVING

02:00:48.207 --> 02:00:50.376
NURSE TO PATIENT RATIOS HERE IN

02:00:50.443 --> 02:00:54.246
CALIFORNIA. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:00:54.313 --> 02:00:59.385
PATTERSON. YES. QUESTION. IS THE

02:00:59.452 --> 02:01:03.356
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS BILL

02:01:03.422 --> 02:01:06.492
TO BASICALLY ENSURE IMPOSITION

02:01:06.559 --> 02:01:09.462
OF PENALTIES SHOULD A HOSPITAL

02:01:09.528 --> 02:01:11.497
NOT COMPLY WITH THE WITH THE

02:01:11.564 --> 02:01:16.102
EXISTING LAW, OR IS IT TO. I

02:01:16.168 --> 02:01:17.269
DON'T KNOW, THIS ISN'T THE

02:01:17.336 --> 02:01:19.071
GREATEST WORD, BUT DICTATE HOW

02:01:19.138 --> 02:01:22.241
THEY FULFILL THE OBLIGATIONS

02:01:22.308 --> 02:01:23.676
THAT ARE REQUIRED UNDER THE LAW.

02:01:23.743 --> 02:01:25.511
I WOULD SAY KIND OF NEITHER

02:01:25.578 --> 02:01:26.646
ASSEMBLYMEMBERS, BECAUSE I THINK

02:01:26.712 --> 02:01:28.781
THE BILL THAT WAS PASSED YEARS

02:01:28.848 --> 02:01:30.950
AGO ALREADY KIND OF DICTATED HOW

02:01:31.017 --> 02:01:32.284
THEY HAVE TO MEET THOSE RATIOS.

02:01:32.351 --> 02:01:33.419
RIGHT? AND THERE'S FLEXIBILITY

02:01:33.486 --> 02:01:34.920
THERE. IT ALREADY DICTATED HOW

02:01:34.987 --> 02:01:36.756
THEY CAN AVOID A PENALTY

02:01:36.822 --> 02:01:38.658
ALREADY, BUT WE JUST FELL SHORT

02:01:38.724 --> 02:01:40.760
OF DEFINING THAT ON CALL LIST.

02:01:40.826 --> 02:01:42.361
SO WE'RE JUST LOOKING TO DEFINE

02:01:42.428 --> 02:01:45.464
ON CALL LIST. SO IT'S TO HAVE

02:01:45.531 --> 02:01:46.866
CLARITY BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO

02:01:46.932 --> 02:01:48.567
HAVE A LOT MORE HEALTH CARE

02:01:48.634 --> 02:01:50.069
REPRESENTATIVES FILE COMPLAINTS

02:01:50.136 --> 02:01:51.237
TO DEPARTMENTS AND SAY, HEY,

02:01:51.303 --> 02:01:53.105
WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT FEELING LIKE

02:01:53.172 --> 02:01:54.840
WE HAVE SUPPORT OR MEETING THE

02:01:54.907 --> 02:01:56.475
RATIOS. I HAVE TOO MANY PATIENTS

02:01:56.542 --> 02:01:57.810
UNDER MY BELT. THOSE COMPLAINTS

02:01:57.877 --> 02:01:59.111
ARE GOING UP TO THE DEPARTMENT.

02:01:59.178 --> 02:02:00.613
THE DEPARTMENT RIGHT NOW IS, AS

02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:03.315
I SAID, MAYBE 32 HAVE HAVE GONE

02:02:03.382 --> 02:02:06.218
INTO INVESTIGATION IN THE PAST

02:02:06.285 --> 02:02:08.454
FIVE YEARS. AND THEY ALSO NEED

02:02:08.521 --> 02:02:11.323
CLARITY ON HOW CAN I ENFORCE

02:02:11.390 --> 02:02:13.192
SOMETHING WHEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT

02:02:13.259 --> 02:02:15.661
AN ON CALL LIST IS. SO IT'S NOT

02:02:15.728 --> 02:02:16.829
TO INCREASE OR ADD PENALTIES,

02:02:16.896 --> 02:02:19.031
WHICH IS WHY I DIDN'T WANT TO

02:02:19.098 --> 02:02:19.999
INCREASE THE CURRENT PENALTIES

02:02:20.066 --> 02:02:21.734
RIGHT NOW IN THIS BILL. IT'S TO

02:02:21.801 --> 02:02:22.601
ACTUALLY HAVE THE INTENT OF THE

02:02:22.668 --> 02:02:24.236
PREVIOUS BILL ACTUALLY BE

02:02:24.303 --> 02:02:26.038
ENFORCED AND PUT SOME TEETH

02:02:26.105 --> 02:02:27.907
BEHIND THE ON CALL LIST. THAT'S

02:02:27.973 --> 02:02:29.742
REALLY MY INTENT BEHIND THIS.

02:02:29.809 --> 02:02:32.878
YEAH, I GET THAT AND APPRECIATE

02:02:32.945 --> 02:02:35.681
THAT. I, I'M THINKING, YOU KNOW,

02:02:35.748 --> 02:02:37.683
I THINK HALF OF THE PEOPLE WHO

02:02:37.750 --> 02:02:40.286
LIVE ON MY STREET ARE NURSES,

02:02:40.352 --> 02:02:41.520
JUST BASED ON THE PROXIMITY OF

02:02:41.587 --> 02:02:43.122
WHERE I LIVE. AND HONESTLY, ALL

02:02:43.189 --> 02:02:44.523
OF THEM ARE, YOU KNOW, I MEAN,

02:02:44.590 --> 02:02:46.559
THEY WORK REALLY HARD. I MEAN,

02:02:46.625 --> 02:02:49.161
THEY'RE, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE HARD

02:02:49.228 --> 02:02:50.996
WORKERS AND THEY'RE OFTEN TIRED,

02:02:51.063 --> 02:02:55.334
YOU KNOW. BUT ALSO, I KNOW WHAT

02:02:55.401 --> 02:02:56.769
I WOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT FROM

02:02:56.836 --> 02:02:58.037
SOME OF THEM. AND I THINK THESE

02:02:58.104 --> 02:02:59.605
ARE SOME, SOME MEMBERS OF SOME

02:02:59.672 --> 02:03:01.273
OF THE SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL,

02:03:01.340 --> 02:03:03.642
YOU KNOW, THEY SOME OF THEM LIKE

02:03:03.709 --> 02:03:04.977
THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE WAY THEIR

02:03:05.044 --> 02:03:08.147
JOBS ARE NOW. AND SO I DO HAVE

02:03:08.214 --> 02:03:10.082
SOME CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT THIS

02:03:10.149 --> 02:03:11.917
COULD MEAN FOR, FOR THOSE

02:03:11.984 --> 02:03:12.651
INDIVIDUALS, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE

02:03:12.718 --> 02:03:13.986
THAT'S ACTUALLY HOW THEY GET

02:03:14.053 --> 02:03:15.020
THEIR RESPITE, YOU KNOW, HOW

02:03:15.087 --> 02:03:19.625
THEY GET THERE. THEY'RE RELAXED

02:03:19.692 --> 02:03:21.460
IS SORT OF THE AMOUNT OF

02:03:21.527 --> 02:03:22.962
FLEXIBILITY THEY HAVE. SOME OF

02:03:23.028 --> 02:03:24.530
THEM, RIGHT. NOT ALL OF THEM

02:03:24.597 --> 02:03:25.898
HAVE THAT SAME KIND OF

02:03:25.965 --> 02:03:28.134
FLEXIBILITY. SO AND FEEL FREE TO

02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:29.268
ADDRESS THAT POINT IF YOU'D

02:03:29.335 --> 02:03:30.870
LIKE. AS A MEMBER, THIS DOESN'T

02:03:30.936 --> 02:03:32.271
CHANGE THE AMOUNT OF HOURS A

02:03:32.338 --> 02:03:33.873
NURSE WORKS, THE AMOUNT OF

02:03:33.939 --> 02:03:35.941
SHIFTS A NURSE WILL TAKE ON

02:03:36.008 --> 02:03:37.042
WHATSOEVER DOES NOT TOUCH. IF A

02:03:37.109 --> 02:03:39.545
NURSE WANTS TO STICK TO THEIR

02:03:39.612 --> 02:03:41.680
THREE SHIFTS OF 12 HOURS A WEEK,

02:03:41.747 --> 02:03:43.215
THEY CAN STICK TO THAT

02:03:43.282 --> 02:03:44.917
WHATSOEVER. THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:03:44.984 --> 02:03:46.485
FROM SANTA CLARITA MENTIONED,

02:03:46.552 --> 02:03:48.320
YOU KNOW, THE ABILITY OF

02:03:48.387 --> 02:03:49.255
CONTRACTING WITH TRAVELING

02:03:49.321 --> 02:03:51.190
NURSES COMPANIES TO FILL IN

02:03:51.257 --> 02:03:54.260
THOSE SPOTS. SO IT'S NOT TO ADD

02:03:54.326 --> 02:03:55.528
NOT TO SAY NURSES, YOU HAVE TO

02:03:55.594 --> 02:03:57.496
TAKE ADDITIONAL SHIFTS. IT'S NOT

02:03:57.563 --> 02:03:58.798
TO SAY NURSES, YOU HAVE TO

02:03:58.864 --> 02:04:01.500
ACCEPT TO BE AN ON CALL LIST.

02:04:01.567 --> 02:04:02.668
IT'S NOT TO SAY NURSES. YOU HAVE

02:04:02.735 --> 02:04:04.336
TO BE SCHEDULED TO BE ON CALL.

02:04:04.403 --> 02:04:05.671
IT SNOWS. IT'S THE

02:04:05.738 --> 02:04:06.672
RESPONSIBILITY ALWAYS OF THE

02:04:06.739 --> 02:04:07.540
EMPLOYER, REGARDLESS OF WHAT

02:04:07.606 --> 02:04:09.408
SECTOR WE'RE IN, TO MAINTAIN AN

02:04:09.475 --> 02:04:10.609
ADEQUATE LEVEL OF EMPLOYEE TO

02:04:10.676 --> 02:04:12.278
MEET THE NEEDS AND DEMANDS OF

02:04:12.344 --> 02:04:13.445
THEIR SECTOR. SO THIS BILL WOULD

02:04:13.512 --> 02:04:14.880
JUST SAY HOSPITAL. MAKE SURE YOU

02:04:14.947 --> 02:04:17.650
HAVE THAT NUMBER, NOT HOSPITAL.

02:04:17.716 --> 02:04:19.485
FORCED EMPLOYEES TO BE ON YOUR

02:04:19.552 --> 02:04:22.721
ON CALL LIST WHATSOEVER. SO THE

02:04:22.788 --> 02:04:23.722
FLEXIBILITY OF YOUR NEIGHBORS

02:04:23.789 --> 02:04:29.528
WAS STILL EXIST. THANK YOU. I

02:04:29.595 --> 02:04:31.764
DON'T SEE ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR

02:04:31.831 --> 02:04:33.132
QUESTIONS. SO I WANTED TO JUST

02:04:33.199 --> 02:04:36.402
TO OFFER MY THOUGHTS ON THIS.

02:04:36.468 --> 02:04:38.237
SENATOR, I KNOW THAT THIS IS

02:04:38.304 --> 02:04:40.739
YOU'VE WORKED VERY HARD AND I

02:04:40.806 --> 02:04:42.541
WHAT I HEARD IN YOUR OPENING WAS

02:04:42.608 --> 02:04:46.178
JUST THE REALITY THAT WE WORK

02:04:46.245 --> 02:04:47.980
REALLY HARD FOR OUR BILLS AND

02:04:48.047 --> 02:04:50.616
OFTEN NEGOTIATE AND TO MAKE SURE

02:04:50.683 --> 02:04:52.618
THAT WE'RE MOVING FORWARD POLICY

02:04:52.685 --> 02:04:54.453
THAT REALLY CONSIDERS ALL

02:04:54.520 --> 02:04:57.256
STAKEHOLDERS AND SOMETIMES WE'RE

02:04:57.323 --> 02:05:00.159
NOT ABLE TO GET THERE BY THE

02:05:00.226 --> 02:05:02.728
POLICY HEARING DATE. AND THERE'S

02:05:02.795 --> 02:05:04.096
ALWAYS SOME FRUSTRATION AROUND

02:05:04.163 --> 02:05:05.664
THAT. BUT I ALSO KNOW YOU TO BE

02:05:05.731 --> 02:05:07.800
AN AUTHOR THAT CONTINUES TO JUST

02:05:07.867 --> 02:05:09.535
WORK WITH PEOPLE TO ENSURE THAT

02:05:09.602 --> 02:05:11.370
WE'RE VERY BALANCED AND BEING

02:05:11.437 --> 02:05:12.605
ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD POLICY. AND

02:05:12.671 --> 02:05:14.106
I'M SURE WE'LL ALWAYS WORK WITH

02:05:14.173 --> 02:05:16.141
CHRISTY. WE ALWAYS AND I'M SURE

02:05:16.208 --> 02:05:17.543
THAT THAT WILL BE THE CASE HERE

02:05:17.610 --> 02:05:19.411
AS WELL. CHAIR. SO I APPRECIATE

APPRECIATE THAT WE ARE IN THE

02:05:32.558 --> 02:05:34.860
NEED OF MAKING SURE WE'RE

02:05:34.927 --> 02:05:36.729

NURSES THAT I TALK TO WHEN I

02:05:42.601 --> 02:05:45.838
VISIT HOSPITALS THROUGHOUT THE

SUPPORTIVE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS

02:05:55.514 --> 02:05:57.049
LEVEL OF BURNOUT THAT THEY ARE

02:05:57.116 --> 02:05:59.752
EXPERIENCING. WE KNOW THAT WE

02:05:59.818 --> 02:06:05.224

02:06:05.291 --> 02:06:07.059
WITH MAKING SURE THAT OUR NURSES

02:06:07.126 --> 02:06:08.494
ARE CONTINUING TO CONTINUE TO BE

02:06:08.560 --> 02:06:09.895
ABLE TO STAY WITHIN THE

02:06:09.962 --> 02:06:11.263
HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE, AND THAT

02:06:11.330 --> 02:06:12.798
IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO

02:06:12.865 --> 02:06:14.566
VERY MUCH PROTECT. SO I'M

02:06:14.633 --> 02:06:15.634

ABLE TO TAKE SOME OF THE

02:06:18.938 --> 02:06:21.173
AMENDMENTS. I ALSO HEAR THE

02:06:21.240 --> 02:06:23.842
OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS AROUND

02:06:23.909 --> 02:06:25.411
ENSURING THAT WE THEY CONTINUE

02:06:25.477 --> 02:06:27.112
TO BE ABLE TO BE RESPONSIVE TO

02:06:27.179 --> 02:06:30.382
WHAT IS A VERY DYNAMIC SETTING

02:06:30.449 --> 02:06:32.251
WITHIN THE HOSPITAL, WITHIN THE

02:06:32.318 --> 02:06:34.553
HOSPITAL SETTING. SO I KNOW THAT

02:06:34.620 --> 02:06:36.889
WE WILL GET THERE IN BEING ABLE

02:06:36.956 --> 02:06:38.290
TO STRIKE THE PERFECT BALANCE,

02:06:38.357 --> 02:06:40.426
TO BE ABLE TO DO BOTH. AND WITH

02:06:40.492 --> 02:06:42.628
THAT, WHEN THE TIME COMES, I'M

02:06:42.695 --> 02:06:44.430
SURE WE WILL BE ABLE TO

02:06:44.496 --> 02:06:46.365
ENTERTAIN A MOTION FOR SUPPORT.

02:06:46.432 --> 02:06:47.666
AND WITH THAT, WOULD YOU LIKE TO

02:06:47.733 --> 02:06:49.401

THE CONVERSATION HERE. YOU KNOW,

02:06:52.137 --> 02:06:53.172
THROUGHOUT THIS TIME, I WAS

02:06:53.238 --> 02:06:54.640
TRYING TO READ THROUGH THE BILL

02:06:54.707 --> 02:06:56.709
JUST TO MAKE SURE AND IF IT'S

02:06:56.775 --> 02:06:59.144
NOT CLEAR, THE INTENT IS TO

02:06:59.211 --> 02:06:59.812
ALLOW FLEXIBILITY IN HOSPITALS,

02:06:59.878 --> 02:07:02.448
ABILITY TO STAFF THAT SHOULD

02:07:02.514 --> 02:07:04.350
REMAIN. THAT IS THE INTENT OF

02:07:04.416 --> 02:07:05.384
THEIR FLEXIBILITY TO STAY THE

02:07:05.451 --> 02:07:06.785
SAME. AND THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE

02:07:06.852 --> 02:07:08.587
TOOK IN REMOVING THE 10%, WE

02:07:08.654 --> 02:07:10.723
EVEN HAD AN OPPOSITION MOVE FROM

02:07:10.789 --> 02:07:12.558
OPPOSED TO NEUTRAL, THE

02:07:12.624 --> 02:07:13.592
ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA

02:07:13.659 --> 02:07:14.793
HEALTHCARE DISTRICTS THAT

02:07:14.860 --> 02:07:16.295
REPRESENT HOSPITALS IN RURAL AND

02:07:16.362 --> 02:07:18.998
SMALL AREAS. AND THEY STATE THAT

02:07:19.064 --> 02:07:21.867
SB 596 IS, AS IT'S WRITTEN NOW

02:07:21.934 --> 02:07:22.601
WITH THE AMENDMENTS, IS

02:07:22.668 --> 02:07:24.069
CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT LAW AND

02:07:24.136 --> 02:07:26.271
IN OUR VIEW, DOES NOT EXPAND

02:07:26.338 --> 02:07:27.639
EXISTING STAFFING REQUIREMENTS

02:07:27.706 --> 02:07:30.943
BECAUSE THAT'S ALREADY IN LAW IN

02:07:31.010 --> 02:07:32.644
JANUARY 1ST, 2026 WHEN ALL OUR

02:07:32.711 --> 02:07:34.680
BILLS YEAH, 2026 WHEN MOST OF

02:07:34.747 --> 02:07:36.348
OUR BILLS ARE GOING TO GO INTO

02:07:36.415 --> 02:07:38.083
LAW THIS VÌ 96 IF IT'S PASSED,

02:07:38.150 --> 02:07:39.918
NOTHING WILL CHANGE. NOTHING

02:07:39.985 --> 02:07:41.787
WILL HAPPEN ON JANUARY 1ST

02:07:41.854 --> 02:07:42.821
BECAUSE HOSPITALS WILL STILL

02:07:42.888 --> 02:07:45.290
HAVE TO MEET THE SAME STAFFING

02:07:45.357 --> 02:07:46.792
REQUIREMENTS. THEY STILL HAVE TO

02:07:46.859 --> 02:07:47.793
CALL WHATEVER THEY NEED TO CALL

02:07:47.860 --> 02:07:49.628
FLOAT POOLS, WHAT HAVE YOU TO

02:07:49.695 --> 02:07:51.930
MEET THOSE NEEDS. HOWEVER, IF ON

02:07:51.997 --> 02:07:53.866
JANUARY 3RD OR JANUARY 4TH, CDF

02:07:53.932 --> 02:07:55.734
GOES AND INSPECTS A HOSPITAL AND

02:07:55.801 --> 02:07:57.870
THEY'RE FOUND IN VIOLATION, THEN

02:07:57.936 --> 02:07:59.705
MY BILL WOULD KICK IN. IF THAT

02:07:59.772 --> 02:08:01.907
HOSPITAL SAYS I CALLED AN ON

02:08:01.974 --> 02:08:03.575
CALL LIST. SO THE DEPARTMENT

02:08:03.642 --> 02:08:04.743
WILL ONLY SAY LET ME SEE YOUR

02:08:04.810 --> 02:08:06.578
LIST. DID YOU ACTUALLY CALL

02:08:06.645 --> 02:08:07.880
PEOPLE THAT YOU HAD SCHEDULED ON

02:08:07.946 --> 02:08:08.714
CALL? DID YOU ACTUALLY CALL

02:08:08.781 --> 02:08:11.083
PEOPLE THAT WERE THAT HAVE THE

02:08:11.150 --> 02:08:12.985
BACKGROUND OF THAT SET UNIT IN

02:08:13.052 --> 02:08:14.586
THE HOSPITAL THAT ARE APPLICABLE

02:08:14.653 --> 02:08:15.721
TO THAT UNIT? LET'S MAKE SURE

02:08:15.788 --> 02:08:17.890
THAT THAT ON CALL IS ACTUALLY AN

02:08:17.956 --> 02:08:19.591
ON CALL LIST. IT DOES NOT SAY

02:08:19.658 --> 02:08:21.660
YOU HAVE TO CALL FIVE PEOPLE.

02:08:21.727 --> 02:08:22.961
HOSPITAL COULD JUST CALL ONE

02:08:23.028 --> 02:08:24.329
PERSON IF THEY WANT. JUST MAKE

02:08:24.396 --> 02:08:25.964
SURE THAT ONE PERSON WAS

02:08:26.031 --> 02:08:26.799
SCHEDULED TO BE ON CALL AND SO

02:08:26.865 --> 02:08:28.467
FORTH. WE ATTEMPTED TO BE AS

02:08:28.534 --> 02:08:29.701
FLEXIBLE AS POSSIBLE, BUT ALSO

02:08:29.768 --> 02:08:31.837
ENSURING THAT THE NEEDS THAT THE,

02:08:31.904 --> 02:08:32.838
THE WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM OUR

02:08:32.905 --> 02:08:34.640
HEALTHCARE STAFF IS REAL. AND IF

02:08:34.706 --> 02:08:36.108
WE DON'T SUPPORT THEM, THEN OUR

02:08:36.175 --> 02:08:37.943
LOVED ONES ARE GOING TO BE THE

02:08:38.010 --> 02:08:39.812
ONES WHO ARE GOING TO BE AT THE

02:08:39.878 --> 02:08:40.779
BRUNT END OF RECEIVING PERHAPS

02:08:40.846 --> 02:08:42.581
INADEQUATE HEALTHCARE, NOT

02:08:42.648 --> 02:08:43.115
BECAUSE OF THE HEALTHCARE

02:08:43.182 --> 02:08:44.349
WORKERS THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO.

02:08:44.416 --> 02:08:45.751
IT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE

02:08:45.818 --> 02:08:46.885
THAT SUPPORT. WITH THAT, WE'LL

02:08:46.952 --> 02:08:48.353
ALWAYS CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE WE

02:08:48.420 --> 02:08:50.823
CAN MAKE THAT CLEAR IN MY BILL

02:08:50.889 --> 02:08:51.490

02:12:49.594 --> 02:12:52.097
AND BUYING INSULIN. THESE ARE

02:12:52.164 --> 02:12:53.465
CHOICES NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO

02:12:53.532 --> 02:12:55.200
MAKE. IN A STATE AS RESOURCE

02:12:55.267 --> 02:12:57.502
RICH AS CALIFORNIA, THERE ARE

02:12:57.569 --> 02:12:58.904
MANY OTHER PATIENTS WHO TRY TO

02:12:58.970 --> 02:13:01.006
EVEN STRETCH DOSES TO GET ENOUGH

02:13:01.073 --> 02:13:03.542
THROUGH THE MONTH. SB 40 IS A

02:13:03.608 --> 02:13:05.277
MEANINGFUL STEP FORWARD BY

02:13:05.344 --> 02:13:07.112
CAPPING INSULIN COST AND

02:13:07.179 --> 02:13:08.947
IMPROVING ACCESS. THIS BILL

02:13:09.014 --> 02:13:11.083
ENSURES PATIENTS CAN FOCUS ON

02:13:11.149 --> 02:13:13.251
THEIR HEALTH WITHOUT THE FEAR OF

02:13:13.318 --> 02:13:15.420
FINANCIAL HARDSHIP. THIS BILL IS

02:13:15.487 --> 02:13:17.556
NOT JUST ABOUT NUMBERS ON A

02:13:17.622 --> 02:13:19.057
SPREADSHEET. IT'S ABOUT HUMAN

02:13:19.124 --> 02:13:21.960
DIGNITY, EQUITY, AND IT IS ALSO

02:13:22.027 --> 02:13:23.462
ABOUT SAVING LIVES AND

02:13:23.528 --> 02:13:25.497
PREVENTING PREVENTING AVOIDABLE

02:13:25.564 --> 02:13:27.232
SUFFERING, ESPECIALLY LIKE THE

02:13:27.299 --> 02:13:29.167
COMPLICATIONS THAT PATIENTS WHO

02:13:29.234 --> 02:13:31.570
ARE WHO ARE FACING UNCONTROLLED

02:13:31.636 --> 02:13:34.573
DIABETES FACE EVERY DAY,

02:13:34.639 --> 02:13:37.109
ESPECIALLY LIKE A LIMB

02:13:37.175 --> 02:13:38.477
AMPUTATION IS ONE OF THE MAJOR

02:13:38.543 --> 02:13:40.712
CAUSE. AS A PHYSICIAN, A

02:13:40.779 --> 02:13:42.114
SCIENTIST, AND A PASSIONATE

02:13:42.180 --> 02:13:43.482
ADVOCATE FOR MY PATIENTS, I

02:13:43.548 --> 02:13:45.717
REALLY URGE TO SUPPORT SB 40.

02:13:45.784 --> 02:13:47.252
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR

02:13:50.622 --> 02:13:51.790
GOOD AFTERNOON, MADAM CHAIR, AND

02:13:51.857 --> 02:13:52.824
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY

02:13:52.891 --> 02:13:55.460
NAME IS BEN BUKER AND I'M A

02:13:55.527 --> 02:13:56.428
STUDENT AT UC DAVIS HERE

02:13:56.495 --> 02:13:57.796
REPRESENTING THE DAVIS COLLEGE

02:13:57.863 --> 02:13:58.897
DEMOCRATS. AND I AM PROUD TO

02:13:58.964 --> 02:14:00.465
SUPPORT SB 40 TO CAP INSULIN

02:14:00.532 --> 02:14:01.500
CO-PAYS AT $35 A MONTH. AS A

02:14:01.566 --> 02:14:03.835
COLLEGE STUDENT, I KNOW HOW HARD

02:14:03.902 --> 02:14:04.936
IT IS TO MAKE ENDS MEET. A

02:14:05.003 --> 02:14:06.705
RECENT POLL OF US COLLEGE

02:14:06.772 --> 02:14:07.906
STUDENTS FOUND 1 IN 5 STUDENTS

02:14:07.973 --> 02:14:09.574
HAVE LESS THAN $100 IN THE BANK

02:14:09.641 --> 02:14:11.042
RIGHT NOW. MOREOVER, 47% EITHER

02:14:11.109 --> 02:14:12.644
DON'T HAVE A SAVINGS ACCOUNT OR

02:14:12.711 --> 02:14:14.679
HAVE ONE WITH NO MONEY IN IT.

02:14:14.746 --> 02:14:15.447
OVERALL, 23% OF UNDERGRADUATES

02:14:15.514 --> 02:14:16.481
ARE EXPERIENCING FOOD

02:14:16.548 --> 02:14:18.083
INSECURITY. THESE STATISTICS

02:14:18.150 --> 02:14:19.484
MAKE LIFE DIFFICULT FOR COLLEGE

02:14:19.551 --> 02:14:21.319
STUDENTS, BUT FOR STUDENTS WITH

02:14:21.386 --> 02:14:22.053
DIABETES, THESE STATISTICS CAN

02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:23.822
BE DEADLY BECAUSE CALIFORNIA,

02:14:23.889 --> 02:14:25.690
UNLIKE 28 OTHER STATES, HAS YET

02:14:25.757 --> 02:14:27.392
TO PASS INSULIN CO-PAY CAP

02:14:27.459 --> 02:14:28.827
PROTECTIONS INTO LAW. INSULIN IS

02:14:28.894 --> 02:14:31.363
NOT OPTIONAL. IN CALIFORNIA, A

02:14:31.430 --> 02:14:33.532
HEALTH PLAN CAN CHARGE $250 FOR

02:14:33.598 --> 02:14:34.866
INSULIN CO-PAY, AND THAT'S AFTER

02:14:34.933 --> 02:14:36.601
YOU'VE MET YOUR DEDUCTIBLE. IF

02:14:36.668 --> 02:14:37.769
YOU HAVEN'T MET YOUR DEDUCTIBLE,

02:14:37.836 --> 02:14:39.004
THEY CHARGE THE FULL PRICE,

02:14:39.070 --> 02:14:40.839
WHICH CAN BE $1,000, EVEN THOUGH

02:14:40.906 --> 02:14:43.308
THE HEALTH PLAN OR THEIR PBM

02:14:43.375 --> 02:14:44.776
NEVER PAID THAT MUCH FOR

02:14:44.843 --> 02:14:46.144
INSULIN. AS A RESULT OF REBATE

02:14:46.211 --> 02:14:48.280
CONTRACTS WITH MANUFACTURERS, IN

02:14:48.346 --> 02:14:49.281
FACT, THE FEDERAL TRADE

02:14:49.347 --> 02:14:50.849
COMMISSION FOUND IN THEIR

02:14:50.916 --> 02:14:51.850
INVESTIGATION THAT PATIENTS WITH

02:14:51.917 --> 02:14:53.318
DEDUCTIBLES AND COINSURANCE WERE

02:14:53.385 --> 02:14:56.121
FORCED TO PAY MORE OUT OF POCKET

02:14:56.188 --> 02:14:57.823
FOR INSULIN THAN THE ENTIRE NET

02:14:57.889 --> 02:14:59.391
COST OF THE DRUG TO THE PAYER.

02:14:59.458 --> 02:15:01.660
SB 40 IS A NECESSARY STEP TO

02:15:01.726 --> 02:15:03.462
MAKING INSULIN MORE AFFORDABLE

02:15:03.528 --> 02:15:04.463
FOR CALIFORNIANS, INCLUDING

02:15:04.529 --> 02:15:05.597
COLLEGE STUDENTS AND OTHERS WHO

02:15:05.664 --> 02:15:07.833
LIVE ON THE MARGINS. NOW, WITH

02:15:07.899 --> 02:15:09.067
RISING PRICES ON BASIC

02:15:09.134 --> 02:15:10.469
NECESSITIES LIKE FOOD AND

02:15:10.535 --> 02:15:12.337
HOUSING, INSULIN CO-PAY

02:15:12.404 --> 02:15:13.805
PROTECTIONS ARE NEEDED MORE THAN

02:15:13.872 --> 02:15:16.274
EVER. INSULIN IS NOT OPTIONAL. I

02:15:16.341 --> 02:15:17.909
THEREFORE ASK FOR YOUR VOTE TO

02:15:17.976 --> 02:15:19.978
CAP INSULIN CO-PAYS AT $35 A

02:15:20.045 --> 02:15:23.014
MONTH. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. ARE

WELL, I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING

02:18:12.851 --> 02:18:16.287
THIS BILL TODAY. I DON'T REALLY

02:18:16.354 --> 02:18:19.891
UNDERSTAND WHY INSULIN IS SO

02:18:19.958 --> 02:18:22.027
EXPENSIVE. I DON'T NECESSARILY

02:18:22.093 --> 02:18:24.663
THINK, YOU KNOW, I THINK THERE

02:18:24.729 --> 02:18:26.831
ARE A LOT OF PARTIES THAT

02:18:26.898 --> 02:18:27.832
CONTRIBUTE TO THAT, NOT

02:18:27.899 --> 02:18:29.668
NECESSARILY ONLY, YOU KNOW, THE

02:18:29.734 --> 02:18:30.902
HEALTH PLANS OR WHATNOT. I ALSO

02:18:30.969 --> 02:18:32.170
DON'T THINK CALIFORNIA IS

02:18:32.237 --> 02:18:34.472
CAPABLE OF PRODUCING ITS OWN. I

02:18:34.539 --> 02:18:36.074
THINK IT CAN BE PRODUCED BY THE

02:18:36.141 --> 02:18:37.642
PRIVATE MARKET AT THIS PRICE,

02:18:37.709 --> 02:18:39.511
BUT I DON'T IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY

02:18:39.577 --> 02:18:41.546
SENSE WHY INSULIN, WHICH HAS

02:18:41.613 --> 02:18:43.348
BEEN AROUND THE FIRST PEPTIDE

02:18:43.415 --> 02:18:45.950
CREATED, IS SO EXPENSIVE. AND

02:18:46.017 --> 02:18:48.453
SO, YOU KNOW, I THINK WE

02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:49.721
OBVIOUSLY GOT TO DO SOMETHING

02:18:49.788 --> 02:18:51.289
ABOUT THAT. I THINK THIS IS

02:18:51.356 --> 02:18:52.791
SOMETHING TO CONSIDER. THIS

02:18:52.857 --> 02:18:55.326
BILL'S MAYBE A STEP IN THE RIGHT

02:18:55.393 --> 02:18:56.294
DIRECTION. AND IF YOU CAN

02:18:56.361 --> 02:18:58.063
ENLIGHTEN ME ON WHY YOU THINK

02:18:58.129 --> 02:18:58.963
IT'S IMPORTANT OR WHY IT'S

02:18:59.030 --> 02:19:00.732
EXPENSIVE, I'D BE HAPPY TO HEAR

02:19:00.799 --> 02:19:03.101
THAT. BUT JUST MY COMMENTS ARE

02:19:03.168 --> 02:19:06.071
MORE IN TUNE TO THIS IS PEOPLE

02:19:06.137 --> 02:19:07.872
DIE WITHOUT INSULIN. THIS ISN'T

02:19:07.939 --> 02:19:09.708
SOME, YOU KNOW, DRUG THAT PEOPLE

02:19:09.774 --> 02:19:11.109
CAN OPTIONALLY TAKE. I GREW UP

02:19:11.176 --> 02:19:13.645
ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS WAS TYPE

02:19:13.712 --> 02:19:16.915
ONE, AND AT THAT TIME IN THE

02:19:16.981 --> 02:19:19.751
80S, HE WAS SCARED OF DYING, YOU

02:19:19.818 --> 02:19:21.186
KNOW, FROM EATING THE WRONG

02:19:21.252 --> 02:19:22.787
THING. AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE

02:19:22.854 --> 02:19:23.722
CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORS BACK

02:19:23.788 --> 02:19:26.257
THEN. SO. BUT ANYWAYS, AFTER,

02:19:26.324 --> 02:19:28.159
YOU KNOW, 40 YEARS INSULIN IS

02:19:28.226 --> 02:19:30.161
MORE EXPENSIVE, NOT CHEAPER. SO

02:19:30.228 --> 02:19:30.795
I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT.

02:19:30.862 --> 02:19:32.630
BUT ANYWAYS, THANKS FOR BRINGING

02:19:32.697 --> 02:19:40.205

SUPPORTED A BILL LIKE THIS

02:19:45.076 --> 02:19:46.444
SIMILAR BILL LAST YEAR THAT I

02:19:46.511 --> 02:19:48.980
KNOW THAT STRUGGLED, AND I'M

02:19:49.047 --> 02:19:51.015
GLAD YOU BROUGHT IT BACK THIS

02:19:51.082 --> 02:19:52.283
YEAR. I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY

02:19:52.350 --> 02:19:53.184
IMPORTANT AND I APPRECIATE YOU

02:19:53.251 --> 02:19:54.719
WORKING ON IT AND HAPPY TO MOVE

02:19:54.786 --> 02:19:56.654
THE BILL AND SUPPORT IT WHEN WE

02:19:56.721 --> 02:19:59.691
HAVE QUORUM. THANK YOU. THANK

02:19:59.758 --> 02:20:02.627
YOU SENATOR. THIS ENSURES THAT

02:20:02.694 --> 02:20:05.163
WE ARE ABLE TO INSTILL INSULIN

02:20:05.230 --> 02:20:06.865
CO-PAYMENT CAP, WHICH I THINK IS

02:20:06.931 --> 02:20:08.133
SO CRITICAL, PARTICULARLY IN

02:20:08.199 --> 02:20:09.901
THIS MOMENT IN TIME, AS WE ARE

02:20:09.968 --> 02:20:11.669
TRYING TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE

02:20:11.736 --> 02:20:13.671
FOCUSING ON A HEALTHY CALIFORNIA

02:20:13.738 --> 02:20:15.340
AND AFFORDABILITY AT THE SAME

02:20:15.406 --> 02:20:18.343
TIME. AND I THINK CERTAINLY WHEN

02:20:18.409 --> 02:20:19.911
IT IS AVAILABLE, WE'LL HAVE

02:20:19.978 --> 02:20:23.114
HIGHER LEVELS OF ADHERENCE AND

02:20:23.181 --> 02:20:24.482
INSURANCE THAT PEOPLE WON'T BE

02:20:24.549 --> 02:20:27.018
ABLE TO SUFFER AS MUCH. SO WITH

02:20:27.085 --> 02:20:28.820
THAT, WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE?

02:20:28.887 --> 02:20:30.989
THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR AND

02:20:31.055 --> 02:20:34.526
COLLEAGUES. YES, WE TO MISTER

02:20:34.592 --> 02:20:35.660
PATTERSON, WE HAVE A BROKEN

02:20:35.727 --> 02:20:37.595
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND THERE ARE

02:20:37.662 --> 02:20:39.564
A LOT OF THE COSTS ARE DISTORTED

02:20:39.631 --> 02:20:40.832
AND THERE ARE MANY THINGS WE

02:20:40.899 --> 02:20:42.700
NEED TO DO. AND I APPRECIATE A

02:20:42.767 --> 02:20:44.435
LOT OF LEADERSHIP ON THIS

02:20:44.502 --> 02:20:45.670
COMMITTEE AROUND SOME OF THESE

02:20:45.737 --> 02:20:48.006
ISSUES. I ALSO JUST WANT TO SAY

02:20:48.072 --> 02:20:50.608
THAT MY FATHER IS TYPE ONE

02:20:50.675 --> 02:20:51.943
DIABETIC. HE ACTUALLY DEVELOPED

02:20:52.010 --> 02:20:53.845
IT AS AN ADULT IN HIS 30S, WHICH

02:20:53.912 --> 02:20:55.580
IS NOT COMMON. I STILL REMEMBER

02:20:55.647 --> 02:20:57.649
WHEN I WAS A CHILD AND HE FIRST

02:20:57.715 --> 02:20:59.350
HAD IT AND IT WAS VERY, VERY

02:20:59.417 --> 02:21:01.352
HARD. AND INSULIN HAS KEPT HIM

02:21:01.419 --> 02:21:02.654
ALIVE AND HE'S BEEN VERY

02:21:02.720 --> 02:21:04.622
PRIVILEGED THAT IT'S NEVER HE'S

02:21:04.689 --> 02:21:06.558
NEVER HAD TO STRUGGLE WITH THE

02:21:06.624 --> 02:21:09.994
COST. BUT IT REALLY MADE ME

02:21:10.061 --> 02:21:11.095
UNDERSTAND IN A VERY PERSONAL

02:21:11.162 --> 02:21:12.263
WAY, WHAT IT WOULD MEAN IF

02:21:12.330 --> 02:21:14.532
SOMEONE WERE STRUGGLING WITH THE

02:21:14.599 --> 02:21:15.900
COSTS THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT.

02:21:15.967 --> 02:21:17.969
IT'S NOT OPTIONAL. IT'S NOT LIKE

02:21:18.036 --> 02:21:19.204
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO FEEL WORSE

02:21:19.270 --> 02:21:21.439
IF YOU DON'T TAKE IT. YOU'RE

02:21:21.506 --> 02:21:22.874
GOING TO NOT BE WITH US ANY

02:21:22.941 --> 02:21:24.976
LONGER. THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL.

02:21:25.043 --> 02:21:26.778
IT'S TIME TO CAP THE CO-PAY AND

02:21:26.845 --> 02:21:27.912
I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE

02:21:27.979 --> 02:21:30.849
VOTE. THANK YOU. AND WHEN WE ARE

02:21:30.915 --> 02:21:32.483
ABLE TO ESTABLISH QUORUM, I'M

02:21:32.550 --> 02:21:34.919
SURE THAT WILL COME. WE'LL MOVE

02:21:34.986 --> 02:21:37.422
ON NOW. AND THANK YOU FOR DAVIS

02:21:37.488 --> 02:21:41.159
DEMS FOR COMING TO SPEAK TODAY.

02:21:41.226 --> 02:21:42.560
WE'LL MOVE ON. NOW TO YOUR

02:21:42.627 --> 02:21:45.430
SECOND ITEM, SB 363, WHICH IS

02:21:45.496 --> 02:21:47.098
ABOUT HEALTH CARE COVERAGE AND

02:21:47.165 --> 02:22:01.079
INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEWS.

02:22:01.145 --> 02:22:02.547
OKAY. THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR.

02:22:02.614 --> 02:22:04.249
AND SPEAKING OF ANOTHER PIECE OF

02:22:04.315 --> 02:22:07.585
THE SYSTEM THAT NEEDS SOME WORK

02:22:07.652 --> 02:22:08.953
HERE TODAY TO PRESENT SENATE

02:22:09.020 --> 02:22:11.823
BILL 363. HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE

02:22:11.890 --> 02:22:14.359
COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. AND I

02:22:14.425 --> 02:22:16.461
APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE WORKING

02:22:16.527 --> 02:22:22.600
WITH US COLLEAGUES. WE KNOW THAT

02:22:22.667 --> 02:22:26.537
THERE IT IS QUITE COMMON THAT A

02:22:26.604 --> 02:22:28.740
PROVIDER DECIDES THAT THIS IS

02:22:28.806 --> 02:22:30.241
THAT THERE'S A CERTAIN TYPE OF

02:22:30.308 --> 02:22:32.710
MEDICAL CARE THAT THE PATIENT

02:22:32.777 --> 02:22:36.948
NEEDS, AND THEN THE HEALTH PLAN

02:22:37.015 --> 02:22:40.952
DENIES THAT COVERAGE AND THOSE

02:22:41.019 --> 02:22:44.289
DENIALS CAN BE DEVASTATING. AND

02:22:44.355 --> 02:22:45.290
SOMETIMES THEY'RE DENIALS AT

02:22:45.356 --> 02:22:47.859
STICK. SOMETIMES THEY'RE DENIALS

02:22:47.926 --> 02:22:51.829
THAT AFTER A LABYRINTHINE

02:22:51.896 --> 02:22:54.299
PROCESS, YOU CAN GET OVERTURNED.

02:22:54.365 --> 02:22:56.868
THE PROCESS IN CALIFORNIA IS

02:22:56.935 --> 02:22:58.770
THAT YOU HAVE TO DO AN INTERNAL,

02:22:58.836 --> 02:23:01.105
ESSENTIALLY GRIEVANCE WITHIN THE

02:23:01.172 --> 02:23:03.007
HEALTH PLAN. AND IF THAT DOESN'T

02:23:03.074 --> 02:23:05.043
WORK, YOU ARE ENTITLED TO SEEK

02:23:05.109 --> 02:23:09.080
OR. EXCUSE ME, AN INDEPENDENT

02:23:09.147 --> 02:23:12.250
MEDICAL REVIEW OR IMR. AND FROM

02:23:12.317 --> 02:23:15.019
THE DATA THAT WE HAVE, IT

02:23:15.086 --> 02:23:17.956
APPEARS THAT A LARGE MAJORITY OF

02:23:18.022 --> 02:23:20.892
IMRS END UP OVERTURNING THE

02:23:20.959 --> 02:23:23.828
DENIALS. WE ALSO KNOW THAT IMA'S

02:23:23.895 --> 02:23:26.731
ARE OVERWHELMINGLY IN ENGLISH,

02:23:26.798 --> 02:23:29.233
AND THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DO NOT

02:23:29.300 --> 02:23:31.836
EVEN KNOW THAT THEY ARE ENTITLED

02:23:31.903 --> 02:23:33.905
TO SEEK AN IMR. AND IT'S A

02:23:33.972 --> 02:23:34.639
COMPLICATED PROCESS. AND FOR

02:23:34.706 --> 02:23:36.507
PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST TRYING TO

02:23:36.574 --> 02:23:38.943
GET BY AND RAISE THEIR FAMILIES

02:23:39.010 --> 02:23:40.378
AND MAYBE WORKING MORE THAN ONE

02:23:40.445 --> 02:23:42.647
JOB, THE LAST THING THAT THEY

02:23:42.714 --> 02:23:44.749
NEED IS TO HAVE TO SPEND TIME ON

02:23:44.816 --> 02:23:45.984
A LENGTHY PROCESS. THANK YOU SO

02:23:46.050 --> 02:23:48.519
MUCH. AND SO A LOT OF DENIALS

02:23:48.586 --> 02:23:50.822
JUST STAND AS A RESULT. BUT THE

02:23:50.888 --> 02:23:53.992
ONES THAT GET APPEALED TO AN IMR

02:23:54.058 --> 02:23:55.860
WE KNOW THAT ARE LARGELY

02:23:55.927 --> 02:23:58.363
OVERTURNED, PARTICULARLY AROUND

02:23:58.429 --> 02:24:02.700
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. SO AND

02:24:02.767 --> 02:24:05.236
UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE I BECAUSE

02:24:05.303 --> 02:24:06.971
MOST OF THESE DENIALS DO NOT

02:24:07.038 --> 02:24:10.575
RESULT IN IMA'S IT, THERE'S NOT

02:24:10.641 --> 02:24:13.111
A BIG DOWNSIDE FOR HEALTH PLANS

02:24:13.177 --> 02:24:15.613
TO ENGAGE IN PATTERNS OF

02:24:15.680 --> 02:24:17.382
DENIALS, BECAUSE LARGELY IT'S

02:24:17.448 --> 02:24:20.051
NOT GOING TO BE CHALLENGED. I'VE

02:24:20.118 --> 02:24:21.986
WORKED ON THIS ISSUE FOR A FEW

02:24:22.053 --> 02:24:22.954
YEARS. LAST YEAR WE TRIED WE'VE

02:24:23.021 --> 02:24:25.757
TRIED FOR A FEW YEARS TO DO A

02:24:25.823 --> 02:24:27.492
BILL TO TRIGGER AUTOMATIC IMRS

02:24:27.558 --> 02:24:28.860
FOR CERTAIN FOR BEHAVIORAL

02:24:28.926 --> 02:24:32.296
HEALTH DIDN'T WORK. SO WE'RE

02:24:32.363 --> 02:24:33.698
TAKING A DIFFERENT APPROACH WITH

02:24:33.765 --> 02:24:36.434
SB 363, WHICH IS, FIRST OF ALL,

02:24:36.501 --> 02:24:37.902
TO REQUIRE MUCH GREATER

02:24:37.969 --> 02:24:39.370
TRANSPARENCY SO THAT WE ACTUALLY

02:24:39.437 --> 02:24:42.273
HAVE COMPREHENSIVE DATA ABOUT

02:24:42.340 --> 02:24:43.908
DENIALS. AND SO WE DON'T HAVE TO

02:24:43.975 --> 02:24:45.877
JUST COBBLE IT TOGETHER. THAT IN

02:24:45.943 --> 02:24:48.112
AND OF ITSELF WILL BE EXTREMELY

02:24:48.179 --> 02:24:49.947
VALUABLE. AND THEN THE OTHER

02:24:50.014 --> 02:24:52.617
PIECE OF THE BILL IS THAT WHEN A

02:24:52.683 --> 02:24:54.552
HEALTH PLAN HAS IS GETTING

02:24:54.619 --> 02:24:57.522
OVERTURNED ON IMA'S AT A RATE OF

02:24:57.588 --> 02:25:00.358
MORE THAN 50%, THEN THERE WILL

02:25:00.425 --> 02:25:03.394
BE SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES,

02:25:03.461 --> 02:25:05.830
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT AGAIN, THE

02:25:05.897 --> 02:25:07.131
IMA'S ARE THE TIP OF THE

02:25:07.198 --> 02:25:10.101
ICEBERG. AND SO THAT'S WHAT THIS

02:25:10.168 --> 02:25:13.337
BILL DOES. I KNOW THAT, YOU

02:25:13.404 --> 02:25:14.906
KNOW, THERE HAVE BEEN QUESTIONS

02:25:14.972 --> 02:25:16.507
AND COMMENTS ABOUT THE SIZE OF

02:25:16.574 --> 02:25:18.609
THE FINES. AND THE FINES, BY THE

02:25:18.676 --> 02:25:19.911
WAY, WERE USED TO BE HIGHER.

02:25:19.977 --> 02:25:22.747
THEY WERE CUT IN HALF IN SENATE

02:25:22.814 --> 02:25:26.484
HEALTH. AND I APPRECIATE THAT

02:25:26.551 --> 02:25:28.686
CONVERSATION. BUT THE PURPOSE OF

02:25:28.753 --> 02:25:31.722
THESE FINES IS TO NOT BE A COST

02:25:31.789 --> 02:25:34.425
OF DOING BUSINESS, TO BE

02:25:34.492 --> 02:25:35.726
MEANINGFUL ENOUGH THAT IF THAT

02:25:35.793 --> 02:25:38.463
TIP OF THE ICEBERG SHOWS THAT

02:25:38.529 --> 02:25:41.032
YOU ARE A MAJORITY OF THE TIME

02:25:41.099 --> 02:25:42.366
BEING OVERTURNED IN YOUR

02:25:42.433 --> 02:25:44.335
DENIALS, THAT IS A SYSTEMIC

02:25:44.402 --> 02:25:46.304
PROBLEM. AND THERE NEEDS TO BE

02:25:46.370 --> 02:25:47.038
TRUE ACCOUNTABILITY. SO IT IS

02:25:47.105 --> 02:25:48.840
NOT JUST A COST OF DOING

02:25:48.906 --> 02:25:50.875
BUSINESS. SO IT'S CHEAPER TO PAY

02:25:50.942 --> 02:25:52.176
THE FINE THAN IT IS TO DENY

02:25:52.243 --> 02:25:54.946
PEOPLE CARE. SO, COLLEAGUES, I

02:25:55.012 --> 02:25:56.180
APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S WORK

02:25:56.247 --> 02:25:58.649
AND THE AMENDMENTS, AND I

02:25:58.716 --> 02:26:00.751
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE

02:26:00.818 --> 02:26:03.287
WITH ME TODAY. EXCUSE ME. TO

02:26:03.354 --> 02:26:05.523
TESTIFY IS WE HAVE LIZ HELMS,

02:26:05.590 --> 02:26:07.291
PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE

02:26:07.358 --> 02:26:08.326
CALIFORNIA CHRONIC CARE

02:26:08.392 --> 02:26:11.929
COALITION, AND DOCTOR IJEOMA

02:26:11.996 --> 02:26:18.069
OJUKWU. SORRY, MD, A PHYSICIAN,

02:26:18.136 --> 02:26:22.306
DISTINGUISHED FELLOW OF THE.

02:26:22.373 --> 02:26:23.841
EXCUSE ME, PRESIDENT OF THE

02:26:23.908 --> 02:26:26.344
CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF CHILD AND

02:26:26.410 --> 02:26:31.015
ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY. YEP.

02:26:31.082 --> 02:26:32.717
OKAY. GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS

02:26:32.783 --> 02:26:34.185
IJEOMA OJUKWU. I'M BOARD

02:26:34.252 --> 02:26:35.786
CERTIFIED CHILD, ADOLESCENT AND

02:26:35.853 --> 02:26:37.421
ADULT PSYCHIATRIST. I'M

02:26:37.488 --> 02:26:38.456
PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA ACADEMY

02:26:38.523 --> 02:26:39.724
OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT

02:26:39.790 --> 02:26:40.791
PSYCHIATRY, ONE OF THE

02:26:40.858 --> 02:26:42.160
CO-SPONSORS OF THIS BILL. AND

02:26:42.226 --> 02:26:44.328
I'VE HAD OVER 15 YEARS OF

02:26:44.395 --> 02:26:45.363
PSYCHIATRIC PRACTICE. SO I'M

02:26:45.429 --> 02:26:46.898
100% IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. SO

02:26:46.964 --> 02:26:49.066
WHEN I EVALUATE MY PATIENTS IN

02:26:49.133 --> 02:26:50.401
THE CLINIC, I'M CONSIDERING NOT

02:26:50.468 --> 02:26:51.869
JUST THEIR DIAGNOSIS, THEIR

02:26:51.936 --> 02:26:52.503
DISORDER. I'M ALSO LOOKING AT

02:26:52.570 --> 02:26:54.906
OTHER FACTORS THAT AFFECT THEM,

02:26:54.972 --> 02:26:56.607
ALL THE PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS.

02:26:56.674 --> 02:26:58.442
AND SO WHEN I COME UP WITH A

02:26:58.509 --> 02:27:00.344
PLAN, WHEN I COME UP WITH THAT

02:27:00.411 --> 02:27:01.846
TREATMENT PLAN IN COLLABORATION

02:27:01.913 --> 02:27:02.914
WITH THE PATIENT, THEIR

02:27:02.980 --> 02:27:03.681
FAMILIES, IT IS JUST RIDICULOUS

02:27:03.748 --> 02:27:05.616
THAT SOMEBODY ELSE WHO IS NOT,

02:27:05.683 --> 02:27:07.585
WHO HAS NOT EXAMINED WHAT I HAVE

02:27:07.652 --> 02:27:08.920
EXAMINED, GETS TO DECIDE WHETHER

02:27:08.986 --> 02:27:11.022
THAT TREATMENT SHOULD HAPPEN OR

02:27:11.088 --> 02:27:12.823
NOT. AND SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES

02:27:12.890 --> 02:27:14.559
IS MAKE SURE WE HAVE THAT

02:27:14.625 --> 02:27:17.528
TRANSPARENCY, THAT WE KNOW WHY A

02:27:17.595 --> 02:27:18.829
COMPANY DECIDES THAT THEY DON'T

02:27:18.896 --> 02:27:20.264
PAY FOR TREATMENT, THAT HAVE

02:27:20.331 --> 02:27:21.265
DETERMINED, OR MY COLLEAGUES

02:27:21.332 --> 02:27:22.433
HAVE DETERMINED THAT THE PATIENT

02:27:22.500 --> 02:27:24.135
REQUIRES. AND SO TO HAVE THAT

02:27:24.202 --> 02:27:27.038
THIRD PARTY SENATE-ROOM IS JUST

02:27:27.104 --> 02:27:28.072
RIDICULOUS, RIGHT? BECAUSE WE

02:27:28.139 --> 02:27:29.307
HAVE DETERMINED THAT THE

02:27:29.373 --> 02:27:30.608
TREATMENT IS APPROPRIATE, IT'S

02:27:30.675 --> 02:27:32.009
ADEQUATE, IT'S COMPREHENSIVE,

02:27:32.076 --> 02:27:33.844
IT'S VERY INDIVIDUALIZED. AND SO

02:27:33.911 --> 02:27:35.146
TO HAVE SOMEBODY ELSE JUST SAY,

02:27:35.213 --> 02:27:36.781
NO, THAT'S NOT NECESSARY. IT'S

02:27:36.847 --> 02:27:38.849
NOT RIGHT. AND THIS IS REALLY

02:27:38.916 --> 02:27:40.351
IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT

02:27:40.418 --> 02:27:42.019
82% OF YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH

02:27:42.086 --> 02:27:44.355
SERVICES THAT WERE OVERTURNED BY

02:27:44.422 --> 02:27:46.424
AMR, THERE WERE 82% OF THEM IN

02:27:46.490 --> 02:27:48.292
2020 THAT WERE OVERTURNED BY

02:27:48.359 --> 02:27:50.628
AMR. WE ALSO KNOW THAT

02:27:50.695 --> 02:27:51.429
PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENTS REMAIN

02:27:51.495 --> 02:27:53.731
NUMBER ONE REASON THAT YOUTH IN

02:27:53.798 --> 02:27:55.099
CALIFORNIA GETS HOSPITALIZED.

02:27:55.166 --> 02:27:57.235
AND THEN WE ARE SHORT STAFFED.

02:27:57.301 --> 02:27:59.070
THE ACA, WHICH IS AMERICAN

02:27:59.136 --> 02:28:00.204
ACADEMY OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT

02:28:00.271 --> 02:28:01.572
PSYCHIATRY, SAYS WE NEED ABOUT

02:28:01.639 --> 02:28:02.740
47 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT

02:28:02.807 --> 02:28:04.875
PSYCHIATRIST PER 100,000 KIDS.

02:28:04.942 --> 02:28:07.078
THE AVERAGE IN CALIFORNIA IS 14

02:28:07.144 --> 02:28:08.379
TO 15. THERE ARE ABOUT A THIRD

02:28:08.446 --> 02:28:09.847
OF THE COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA

02:28:09.914 --> 02:28:11.048
THAT DO NOT HAVE CHILD AND

02:28:11.115 --> 02:28:12.750
ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRIST. SO WHEN

02:28:12.817 --> 02:28:13.784
INSURANCE COMPANY SAYS YOU'RE

02:28:13.851 --> 02:28:15.653
DENIED, NOBODY HAS THE TIME TO

02:28:15.720 --> 02:28:17.888
GO BACK AND FIGHT. SO IT PUSHES

02:28:17.955 --> 02:28:19.857
IT ON THE PATIENTS TO FIGHT IF

02:28:19.924 --> 02:28:21.459
THEY CAN. AND SO THAT'S JUST A

02:28:21.525 --> 02:28:23.060
WAY THAT WE ARE BURDENING THE

02:28:23.127 --> 02:28:24.996
SYSTEM, MAKING THE MAKING SURE

02:28:25.062 --> 02:28:26.497
THAT OUR YOUTH DON'T GET THE

02:28:26.564 --> 02:28:28.332
CARE THAT THEY NEED. AND THAT'S

02:28:28.399 --> 02:28:29.367
HOW THEY END UP BEING

02:28:29.433 --> 02:28:30.701
HOSPITALIZED. THEY UTILIZE OTHER

02:28:30.768 --> 02:28:31.569
AVENUES. THEY'RE EITHER IN THE

02:28:31.636 --> 02:28:32.737
ER OR SOMETHING HAPPENS, THEY

02:28:32.803 --> 02:28:35.439
END UP IN JAIL. SO WE ARE JUST

02:28:35.506 --> 02:28:36.841
REDISTRIBUTING WHAT WE'RE DOING

02:28:36.907 --> 02:28:37.708
WITH OUR RESOURCES. SO I URGE

02:28:37.775 --> 02:28:40.344
YOU TO PUT THE POWER BACK IN THE

02:28:40.411 --> 02:28:41.612
HANDS OF THE PATIENT AND ALLOW

02:28:41.679 --> 02:28:42.980
OUR PATIENTS GET THE CARE THAT

02:28:43.047 --> 02:28:44.849
THEY NEED WHEN THE APPROPRIATE

02:28:44.915 --> 02:28:45.616
PROVIDER HAS DETERMINED THAT

02:28:45.683 --> 02:28:47.652
THAT'S WHAT THEY NEED ON TIME.

02:28:47.718 --> 02:28:50.187
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. YOU'LL

02:28:50.254 --> 02:28:53.691
HAVE TWO MINUTES NOW. THANK YOU.

02:28:53.758 --> 02:28:55.593

02:28:55.660 --> 02:28:56.761

PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE

02:28:59.664 --> 02:29:00.698

02:29:00.765 --> 02:29:01.866
COALITION, AN ALLIANCE OF MORE

02:29:01.932 --> 02:29:04.535
THAN 30 LEADING CONSUMER HEALTH

02:29:04.602 --> 02:29:05.770

02:29:07.838 --> 02:29:09.040
CARE FOR CALIFORNIANS LIVING

02:29:09.106 --> 02:29:10.875

02:29:10.941 --> 02:29:13.344
OUR 19TH YEAR, WE ARE PROUD TO

02:29:13.411 --> 02:29:15.813
CO-SPONSOR 363 AS. THANK YOU,

02:29:15.880 --> 02:29:18.716
SENATOR WIENER. BUT I AM HERE

02:29:18.783 --> 02:29:20.117
TODAY NOT ONLY AS AN ADVOCATE,

02:29:20.184 --> 02:29:21.852
BUT TO SHARE MY PERSONAL

02:29:21.919 --> 02:29:23.988
JOURNEY, ONE THAT HAS TAKEN ME

02:29:24.055 --> 02:29:26.424
30 YEARS TO GET HERE, ONE THAT

02:29:26.490 --> 02:29:28.526
HAS SHAPED MY DEDICATION TO

02:29:28.592 --> 02:29:31.228
PATIENT AND PUBLIC POLICY. 30

02:29:31.295 --> 02:29:32.730
YEARS INTO MY SECOND CAREER, I

02:29:32.797 --> 02:29:34.765
AM HONORED TO SUPPORT A BILL

02:29:34.832 --> 02:29:36.500
THAT TRULY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO

02:29:36.567 --> 02:29:39.670
CHANGE LIVES. IN 1993, I

02:29:39.737 --> 02:29:41.072
SUFFERED A TRAUMATIC INJURY TO

02:29:41.138 --> 02:29:43.407
MY RIGHT JAW JOINT AS IT HEALED

02:29:43.474 --> 02:29:45.976
THE JOINT FUZED, LEAVING ME IN

02:29:46.043 --> 02:29:47.345
CONSTANT PAIN, HEADACHES,

02:29:47.411 --> 02:29:49.647
NAUSEA, VERTIGO, AND DEPENDENT

02:29:49.714 --> 02:29:52.817
ON OPIOID MEDICATIONS AND MUSCLE

02:29:52.883 --> 02:29:56.821
RELAXANTS. MY LIFE WAS UPENDED.

02:29:56.887 --> 02:29:58.155
UPENDED. I WAS RUNNING A SMALL

02:29:58.222 --> 02:29:59.924
BUSINESS IN FOLSOM WHILE

02:29:59.990 --> 02:30:01.592
PURSUING PURSUING AN

02:30:01.659 --> 02:30:03.661
AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE DEGREE, BUT

02:30:03.728 --> 02:30:05.529
I FACED DENIAL AFTER DENIAL,

02:30:05.596 --> 02:30:08.165
AFTER DENIAL FOR MY HEALTH PLAN.

02:30:08.232 --> 02:30:09.967
FOR NEARLY A YEAR AND A HALF,

02:30:10.034 --> 02:30:11.602
THE FINANCIAL AND EMOTIONAL TOLL

02:30:11.669 --> 02:30:13.871
WAS DEVASTATING BANKRUPTCY, LOSS

02:30:13.938 --> 02:30:15.840
OF MY FAMILY HOME, AND NEARLY

02:30:15.906 --> 02:30:18.342
LOSING MY BUSINESS. IT TOOK A

02:30:18.409 --> 02:30:20.211
DECADE TO REBUILD MY CREDIT AND

02:30:20.277 --> 02:30:23.047
MY STABILITY. MY HEALTH PLAN

02:30:23.114 --> 02:30:24.982
FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THE MEDICAL

02:30:25.049 --> 02:30:26.984
NEEDS THE PREVAILING MODEL SEEMS

02:30:27.051 --> 02:30:29.253
TO BE DENY FIRST DELAY, AND

02:30:29.320 --> 02:30:32.056
MAYBE THE PATIENT WILL GO AWAY.

02:30:32.123 --> 02:30:36.727
MANY DO. I KNOW THEY WISH I HAD.

02:30:36.794 --> 02:30:38.462
REALIZING MANY SHARE MY STORY

02:30:38.529 --> 02:30:40.064
PROPELLED ME INTO PATIENT

02:30:40.131 --> 02:30:43.267
ADVOCACY. NO ONE SHOULD EVER

02:30:43.334 --> 02:30:45.803
ENDURE WHAT I WENT THROUGH. THE

02:30:45.870 --> 02:30:46.971
DENIAL, THE DENIAL AND THE

02:30:47.037 --> 02:30:48.939
DELAY. FIRST APPROACH IS

02:30:49.006 --> 02:30:51.142
INHUMANE AND THE SITUATION IS

02:30:51.208 --> 02:30:53.677
EVEN WORSE FOR TODAY'S PATIENTS.

02:30:53.744 --> 02:30:55.312
I WAS FORTUNATE THAT MY DOCTOR

02:30:55.379 --> 02:30:56.981
SAID HE WASN'T GOING TO ALLOW A

02:30:57.047 --> 02:30:58.783
THIRD PARTY TO TELL HIM HOW TO

02:30:58.849 --> 02:31:00.584
DO IT. HE PROVIDED SURGERY AND

02:31:00.651 --> 02:31:02.887
TOOK THE FULL RISK. I WAS BACK

02:31:02.953 --> 02:31:05.189
TO WORK IN SIX WEEKS. I HAVEN'T

02:31:05.256 --> 02:31:07.158
STOPPED SINCE THEN. SINCE THEN,

02:31:07.224 --> 02:31:09.527
I'VE DEDICATED MYSELF TO BEING A

02:31:09.593 --> 02:31:11.262
VOICE FOR THOSE WHO CANNOT SPEAK

02:31:11.328 --> 02:31:14.198
UP. I LOST MY FEAR AND GAINED A

02:31:14.265 --> 02:31:16.100
PURPOSE. TODAY I SPEAK ON BEHALF

02:31:16.167 --> 02:31:17.935
OF THE MILLIONS OF PATIENTS

02:31:18.002 --> 02:31:20.371
ASKING FOR YOUR HELP. WE NEED

02:31:20.438 --> 02:31:22.173

ABOUT THEIR DENIALS, OVERTURNS,

02:31:23.808 --> 02:31:26.043
AND REVERSALS. THIS IS NOT

02:31:26.110 --> 02:31:28.145
HEALTH CARE. IT'S SICK CARE.

02:31:28.212 --> 02:31:30.014
PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS DESERVE

02:31:30.080 --> 02:31:31.515
BETTER. WE URGE YOU TO HOLD

02:34:43.841 --> 02:34:45.776
PRIOR AUTHORIZATION, AS LONG AS

02:34:45.843 --> 02:34:47.711
THEY IMPROVE THE DELIVERY OF

02:34:47.778 --> 02:34:48.912
CARE AND MAKE THINGS MORE

02:34:48.979 --> 02:34:51.015
EFFICIENT. REGRETTABLY, SB 363

02:34:51.081 --> 02:34:53.517
IS NOT SUCH A SOLUTION. INSTEAD,

02:34:53.584 --> 02:34:55.185
THIS BILL IMPOSES PRETTY

02:34:55.252 --> 02:34:56.286
SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES ON OUR

02:34:56.353 --> 02:34:57.788
MEMBERS THAT ARE COSTLY AND

02:34:57.855 --> 02:34:59.123
BURDENSOME, AND RECENT

02:34:59.189 --> 02:35:00.624
AMENDMENTS THAT WENT INTO THE

02:35:00.691 --> 02:35:02.026
BILL DO NOT RESOLVE OUR

02:35:02.092 --> 02:35:04.228
CONCERNS. FUNDAMENTALLY, THE

02:35:04.294 --> 02:35:05.896
BILL DEMONSTRATES A

02:35:05.963 --> 02:35:07.765
MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE IMR

02:35:07.831 --> 02:35:09.967
PROCESS. IMR IS A VENUE TO

02:35:10.034 --> 02:35:11.435
RESOLVE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION

02:35:11.502 --> 02:35:12.803
REGARDING THE MEDICAL NECESSITY

02:35:12.870 --> 02:35:14.705
OF A COVERED SERVICE. THE

02:35:14.772 --> 02:35:16.173
PRACTICE OF MEDICINE,

02:35:16.240 --> 02:35:17.408
UNFORTUNATELY, IS NOT AN EXACT

02:35:17.474 --> 02:35:18.609
SCIENCE. IT'S PRETTY NUANCED

02:35:18.676 --> 02:35:19.877
FIELD WHERE EQUALLY QUALIFIED

02:35:19.943 --> 02:35:21.478
AND EXPERIENCED CLINICIANS

02:35:21.545 --> 02:35:22.846
FREQUENTLY ARRIVE AT DIFFERING

02:35:22.913 --> 02:35:25.582
YET VALID CONCLUSIONS REGARDING

02:35:25.649 --> 02:35:27.451
A PATIENT'S NEEDS IN A

02:35:27.518 --> 02:35:29.753
PARTICULAR CASE TO IMPOSE

02:35:29.820 --> 02:35:30.788
PUNITIVE PENALTIES ON PLANS FOR

02:35:30.854 --> 02:35:32.556
THESE INHERENT DIFFERENCES OF

02:35:32.623 --> 02:35:34.358
OPINION. CLINICAL OPINION,

02:35:34.425 --> 02:35:36.226
PARTICULARLY ON COMPLEX MEDICAL

02:35:36.293 --> 02:35:37.494
QUESTIONS WE BELIEVE IS PUNITIVE

02:35:37.561 --> 02:35:40.631
AND OVERREACHING. WE DO. OUR

02:35:40.698 --> 02:35:42.399
MEMBERS DO TAKE THE OUTCOMES OF

02:35:42.466 --> 02:35:44.435
IMR SERIOUSLY. THEY REVIEW THEIR

02:35:44.501 --> 02:35:45.903
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WHEN EMR

02:35:45.969 --> 02:35:48.105
DECISIONS RESULT IN AN OVERTURN.

02:35:48.172 --> 02:35:49.973
THESE INSIGHTS ARE ALREADY A

02:35:50.040 --> 02:35:51.475
SUBJECT OF REGULAR DISCUSSIONS

02:35:51.542 --> 02:35:52.509
BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:35:52.576 --> 02:35:53.911
MANAGED HEALTH CARE AND OUR

02:35:53.977 --> 02:35:55.479
MEMBERS. FUNDAMENTALLY, THOUGH,

02:35:55.546 --> 02:35:56.780
WE BELIEVE THAT ARBITRARY AND

02:35:56.847 --> 02:35:57.748
EXCESSIVE PENALTIES WILL NOT

02:35:57.815 --> 02:36:00.684
ENHANCE CARE. INSTEAD, THEY WILL

02:36:00.751 --> 02:36:02.753
APPLY UNNECESSARY COMPLEXITY AND

02:36:02.820 --> 02:36:04.888
ULTIMATELY INCREASE COSTS. FOR

02:36:04.955 --> 02:36:06.256
THOSE REASONS, WE'RE OPPOSED.

02:36:06.323 --> 02:36:09.727
THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR. MEMBERS,

02:36:09.793 --> 02:36:11.161
STEPHANIE WATKINS, ON BEHALF OF

02:36:11.228 --> 02:36:12.563
THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA

02:36:12.629 --> 02:36:13.530
LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE

02:36:13.597 --> 02:36:15.065
COMPANIES. REGRETTABLY, HERE IN

02:36:15.132 --> 02:36:16.567
OPPOSITION AS WELL, JUST TO

02:36:16.633 --> 02:36:17.901
BUILD OFF OF SOME OF MY

02:36:17.968 --> 02:36:19.470
COLLEAGUES COMMENTS, WE'RE ALSO

02:36:19.536 --> 02:36:21.572
CONCERNED THAT SB 363

02:36:21.638 --> 02:36:23.407
ESTABLISHES A NEW AND EXTENSIVE

02:36:23.474 --> 02:36:24.942
REPORTING REQUIREMENT ON HEALTH

02:36:25.008 --> 02:36:26.744
PLANS AND INSURERS, MANDATING

02:36:26.810 --> 02:36:28.378
THE COLLECTION AND SUBMISSION OF

02:36:28.445 --> 02:36:29.847
DISAGGREGATED DATA BASED ON

02:36:29.913 --> 02:36:32.082
VARIOUS FACTORS. SUCH

02:36:32.149 --> 02:36:32.983
REQUIREMENTS WILL PLACE A

02:36:33.050 --> 02:36:33.717
SIGNIFICANT ADMINISTRATIVE

02:36:33.784 --> 02:36:35.552
BURDEN ON PLANS AND INSURERS AT

02:36:35.619 --> 02:36:37.354
A TIME WHEN AFFORDABILITY IS KEY

02:36:37.421 --> 02:36:39.189
TO THE SUCCESS OF HEALTHCARE

02:36:39.256 --> 02:36:40.958
SYSTEM. WITH THAT IN MIND, IT'S

02:36:41.024 --> 02:36:42.426
CRITICAL THAT WE ENSURE THAT ANY

02:36:42.493 --> 02:36:43.527
ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE

02:36:43.594 --> 02:36:44.995
REQUIREMENTS DIRECTLY BENEFIT

02:36:45.062 --> 02:36:46.764
CONSUMERS EXPERIENCE AND BRING

02:36:46.830 --> 02:36:48.132
ADDITIONAL VALUE TO THE SYSTEM.

02:36:48.198 --> 02:36:49.733
TO THAT END, WE'RE NOT CERTAIN

02:36:49.800 --> 02:36:51.168
THAT THE REPORTING PARAMETERS

02:36:51.235 --> 02:36:53.637
OUTLINED IN THIS BILL MEET THAT

02:36:53.704 --> 02:36:55.005
THRESHOLD. FOR THOSE REASONS, WE

02:36:55.072 --> 02:36:56.540
ARE OPPOSED. AND BASED ON MY

02:36:56.607 --> 02:36:58.008
COLLEAGUE'S COMMENTS, WE DO LOOK

02:36:58.075 --> 02:36:59.376
FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO HAVE

02:36:59.443 --> 02:37:00.511
CONVERSATIONS IF THERE'S A

02:37:00.577 --> 02:37:02.412
PATHWAY FORWARD. BUT AT THIS

02:37:02.479 --> 02:37:03.714
POINT, UNFORTUNATELY, WE ARE

02:37:03.781 --> 02:37:06.483
OPPOSED TO THE MEASURE. ARE

02:37:06.550 --> 02:37:08.018
THERE ANY OTHERS IN THE HEARING

02:37:08.085 --> 02:37:09.820
ROOM WHO WOULD LIKE TO OFFER A

02:37:09.887 --> 02:37:14.057
ME TWO IN OPPOSITION TO SB 363?

02:37:14.124 --> 02:37:15.659
THANK YOU. CASSIDY HECKMAN, ON

02:37:15.726 --> 02:37:18.896
BEHALF OF AMERICA'S PHYSICIANS,

02:37:18.962 --> 02:37:22.099
GROUPS IN OPPOSITION. K¾T,

02:37:22.166 --> 02:37:23.967
ANDREW. LOCAL HEALTH PLANS OF

02:37:24.034 --> 02:37:25.669
CALIFORNIA IN OPPOSITION. THANK

02:37:25.736 --> 02:37:28.672
YOU. SEEING NO OTHER OPPOSITION,

02:37:28.739 --> 02:37:30.541
I'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE

02:37:30.607 --> 02:37:31.642
COMMITTEE FOR ANY COMMENTS OR

02:37:31.708 --> 02:37:35.479
QUESTIONS. SENATOR, I'LL JUST

02:37:35.546 --> 02:37:36.947
START OFF WITH A QUESTION. YOU

02:37:37.014 --> 02:37:39.983
KNOW, WE WERE ABLE TO DIG IN A

02:37:40.050 --> 02:37:41.151
LITTLE BIT ON THIS. AND ONE

02:37:41.218 --> 02:37:44.321
THING THAT I LEARNED, WHICH WAS

02:37:44.388 --> 02:37:47.224
INCREDIBLY HELPFUL TO ME, WAS A

02:37:47.291 --> 02:37:50.994
COMMENT RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS

02:37:51.061 --> 02:37:53.730
THAT 72% OF IMS BROUGHT TO DMHC

02:37:53.797 --> 02:37:55.265
LAST YEAR RESULTED IN A

02:37:55.332 --> 02:37:56.967
SUCCESSFUL OVERTURNING OR

02:37:57.034 --> 02:37:58.902
REVERSAL OF A DENIAL, MEANING

02:37:58.969 --> 02:38:00.571
THE ENROLLEE EVENTUALLY GOT THE

02:38:00.637 --> 02:38:02.139
SERVICES THEY REQUESTED AND FOR

02:38:02.206 --> 02:38:04.875
SOME DEMOGRAPHICS AND DIAGNOSES,

02:38:04.942 --> 02:38:06.977
THE EMR PROCESS WAS OVERTURNED.

02:38:07.044 --> 02:38:08.545
THE OVERTURN RATE IS EVEN

02:38:08.612 --> 02:38:10.647
HIGHER, PARTICULARLY WITH

02:38:10.714 --> 02:38:12.449
RELATED TO YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH.

02:38:12.516 --> 02:38:14.218
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, 82% OF HEALTH

02:38:14.284 --> 02:38:15.719
PLAN DENIALS FOR YOUTH IN MENTAL

02:38:15.786 --> 02:38:17.855
HEALTH CARE WERE OVERTURNED BY

02:38:17.921 --> 02:38:22.092
RMR. THAT'S A PRETTY ASTOUNDING

02:38:22.159 --> 02:38:23.160
STATISTIC. SO YOU'VE CERTAINLY

02:38:23.227 --> 02:38:26.597
KIND OF HIT ON WHAT I WOULD CALL

02:38:26.663 --> 02:38:29.833
IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT AND DIRE

02:38:29.900 --> 02:38:32.703
CONCERN. I APPRECIATE THE

02:38:32.769 --> 02:38:34.538
TESTIMONY OFFERED BY YOUR

02:38:34.605 --> 02:38:35.906
WITNESS THAT DESCRIBED KIND OF

02:38:35.973 --> 02:38:38.742
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE TO GO

02:38:38.809 --> 02:38:41.278
THROUGH A PROCESS OVER MANY

02:38:41.345 --> 02:38:42.880
MONTHS AND MONTHS TO BE ABLE TO

02:38:42.946 --> 02:38:44.848
GET SOME RESOLUTION FOR HEALTH

02:38:44.915 --> 02:38:47.784
CARE, ONLY TO THEN PERHAPS END

02:38:47.851 --> 02:38:49.653
UP IN A PERCENTAGE OF

02:38:49.720 --> 02:38:51.455
LIKELIHOOD, PERCENTAGE OF YOU

02:38:51.521 --> 02:38:53.023
BEING ABLE TO GET THE CARE THAT

02:38:53.090 --> 02:38:54.658
YOU NEED THROUGH THAT BEING

02:38:54.725 --> 02:38:57.160
OVERTURNED. SO THIS IS A BIT FOR

02:38:57.227 --> 02:39:00.330
THE OPPOSITION. HOW DO YOU

02:39:00.397 --> 02:39:03.467
ACCOUNT FOR SUCH A HIGH OVERTURN

02:39:03.533 --> 02:39:05.769
RATE AT THE EMR PROCESS, TO BE

02:39:05.836 --> 02:39:08.005
ABLE TO JUSTIFY NOT BEING ABLE

02:39:08.071 --> 02:39:10.007
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS RIGHT

02:39:10.073 --> 02:39:12.342
NOW? YEAH. THANK YOU, CHAIR, FOR

02:39:12.409 --> 02:39:14.077
THAT QUESTION. WE'VE YOU KNOW,

02:39:14.144 --> 02:39:14.912
WE'VE ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, TALKED

02:39:14.978 --> 02:39:16.546
TO THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT THOSE

02:39:16.613 --> 02:39:18.715
NUMBERS. WE HAVE A LITTLE

02:39:18.782 --> 02:39:19.783
DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THAT

02:39:19.850 --> 02:39:22.552
PERCENTAGE. THAT 72% IN

02:39:22.619 --> 02:39:26.657
PARTICULAR, ABOUT 30% OF THOSE

02:39:26.723 --> 02:39:28.725
ARE OVERTURNED BY THE PLANS

02:39:28.792 --> 02:39:31.061
THEMSELVES BECAUSE AS A AS A

02:39:31.128 --> 02:39:32.729
RESULT OF THE EMR PROCESS OR THE

02:39:32.796 --> 02:39:34.665
CASES BEING FILED, INFORMATION

02:39:34.731 --> 02:39:36.400
HAS COME TO LIGHT THAT WAS

02:39:36.466 --> 02:39:37.501
NEEDED IN THE FIRST PLACE TO

02:39:37.567 --> 02:39:40.203
PROCESS THE APPROVAL. SO A GOOD

02:39:40.270 --> 02:39:43.240
PERCENTAGE OF THAT 72%, WE

02:39:43.307 --> 02:39:45.242
BELIEVE, FALL INTO THAT

02:39:45.309 --> 02:39:46.910
CATEGORY. SO WE THINK THE

02:39:46.977 --> 02:39:50.447
OVERTURNS AND ARE MORE LIKE 50%

02:39:50.514 --> 02:39:52.582
FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE, THAT ARE

02:39:52.649 --> 02:39:54.418
ACTUALLY OVERTURNED BY THE

02:39:54.484 --> 02:39:57.220
DEPARTMENT'S REVIEWERS. SO

02:39:57.287 --> 02:39:59.022
WOULDN'T YOU EXPECT, THOUGH,

02:39:59.089 --> 02:40:00.891
PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE GRAVITY

02:40:00.958 --> 02:40:02.693
OF THE SITUATION, AS I

02:40:02.759 --> 02:40:04.494
UNDERSTAND IT, IF YOU IF YOU ARE

02:40:04.561 --> 02:40:06.697
UNDERGOING AN EMR, YOU ARE AT

02:40:06.763 --> 02:40:08.932
THE AT THE YOU ARE AT THE 11TH

02:40:08.999 --> 02:40:09.967
HOUR, RIGHT? YOU HAVE GONE

02:40:10.033 --> 02:40:11.601
THROUGH EVERY SINGLE DENIAL

02:40:11.668 --> 02:40:14.171
PROCESS ALONG THE WAY. IT'S BEEN

02:40:14.237 --> 02:40:15.539
WEEKS, PERHAPS MONTHS, MAYBE

02:40:15.605 --> 02:40:18.041
EVEN IN SOME INSTANCES YEARS

02:40:18.108 --> 02:40:19.943
WHERE TO GET TO THE POINT OF

02:40:20.010 --> 02:40:24.214
IMR. SO TO 50% IS A LOT FOR ME.

02:40:24.281 --> 02:40:26.216
EVEN IF YOU WANT TO GO WITH THAT

02:40:26.283 --> 02:40:28.185
NUMBER, THAT NUMBER SHOULD BE BE

02:40:28.251 --> 02:40:29.252
FOR ME SOMEWHERE IN THE

02:40:29.319 --> 02:40:32.222
NEIGHBORHOOD OF 5 TO 10%. SO HOW

02:40:32.289 --> 02:40:35.292
DO WE CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

02:40:35.359 --> 02:40:37.661
US TO BE ABLE TO REALLY ADDRESS

02:40:37.728 --> 02:40:41.098
THAT? I APPRECIATE THE NÓ. I'M

02:40:41.164 --> 02:40:42.666
HAPPY TO RESPOND. IS THAT A

02:40:42.733 --> 02:40:44.801
QUESTION? SURE. SO I MEAN, SO,

02:40:44.868 --> 02:40:47.604
YOU KNOW, AS WE'VE STATED ON

02:40:47.671 --> 02:40:48.805
PRIOR BILLS, I MEAN, THE

02:40:48.872 --> 02:40:49.873
INDUSTRY HAS COME TOGETHER

02:40:49.940 --> 02:40:51.008
NATIONALLY TO COME UP WITH SOME

02:40:51.074 --> 02:40:52.509
PRIOR AUTHORIZATION PRINCIPLES

02:40:52.576 --> 02:40:53.877
THAT DEAL WITH THIS AT A

02:40:53.944 --> 02:40:55.679
SYSTEMIC LEVEL. THE INDUSTRY IS

02:40:55.746 --> 02:40:57.814
COMMITTED TO REDUCE THE SCOPE OF

02:40:57.881 --> 02:40:59.583
PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS. THEY'VE

02:40:59.649 --> 02:41:00.884
YOU KNOW, THEY TALK ABOUT THE

02:41:00.951 --> 02:41:02.552
IMPORTANCE OF ELECTRONIC

02:41:02.619 --> 02:41:04.588
SUBMISSIONS AND OTHER AREAS.

02:41:04.654 --> 02:41:05.956
ALSO, I THINK DATA IS REALLY

02:41:06.023 --> 02:41:09.259
IMPORTANT AS WELL. THERE IS A

02:41:09.326 --> 02:41:10.727
DATA REQUIREMENT THAT'S GOING TO

02:41:10.794 --> 02:41:12.329
BE KICKING INTO GEAR ON HEALTH

02:41:12.396 --> 02:41:15.032
PLANS IN 2026 THAT REQUIRE A

02:41:15.098 --> 02:41:17.167
LITTLE BIT MORE TRANSPARENCY ON

02:41:17.234 --> 02:41:19.736
WHAT SERVICES HAVE TO GO THROUGH

02:41:19.803 --> 02:41:21.838
AUTHORIZATION, AND WHAT THE

02:41:21.905 --> 02:41:23.640
PERCENTAGE OF DENIALS ARE. AND I

02:41:23.707 --> 02:41:25.509
THINK ONCE WE GET THE DATA, I

02:41:25.575 --> 02:41:26.610
THINK YOU'LL FIND THAT

02:41:26.676 --> 02:41:27.210
CALIFORNIA PROBABLY PERFORMS

02:41:27.277 --> 02:41:28.779
BETTER THAN THAN OTHER STATES IN

02:41:28.845 --> 02:41:30.514
THE COUNTRY. I DON'T KNOW THAT

02:41:30.580 --> 02:41:32.916
FOR SURE. BUT I THINK, YOU KNOW,

02:41:32.983 --> 02:41:34.084
STARTING WITH DATA IS REALLY

02:41:34.151 --> 02:41:34.518
IMPORTANT, AND THOSE

02:41:34.584 --> 02:41:36.019
REQUIREMENTS ARE GOING INTO

02:41:36.086 --> 02:41:39.723
PLACE FOR THE MEDICARE PLANS AND

02:41:39.790 --> 02:41:41.658
THE PLANS THAT OPERATE IN THE

02:41:41.725 --> 02:41:42.759
FEDERAL EXCHANGES. WE'VE

02:41:42.826 --> 02:41:43.760
ADVOCATED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF

02:41:43.827 --> 02:41:45.529
OTHER BILLS TO FOLLOW THAT DATA

02:41:45.595 --> 02:41:47.397
FORMAT. AND I THINK THAT WILL BE

02:41:47.464 --> 02:41:49.166
REVEALING. BUT AGAIN, WE HAVE WE

02:41:49.232 --> 02:41:50.267
HAVE OFFERED AMENDMENTS TO OTHER

02:41:50.333 --> 02:41:51.701
BILLS RELATED TO AUTHORIZATION

02:41:51.768 --> 02:41:53.503
FOR CARE. WE JUST FIND THAT THIS

02:41:53.570 --> 02:41:54.971
BILL GOES A LITTLE BIT TOO FAR.

02:41:55.038 --> 02:41:57.240
AND, YOU KNOW, WE'RE UNABLE TO,

02:41:57.307 --> 02:41:58.575
YOU KNOW, ENGAGE AT THAT LEVEL.

02:41:58.642 --> 02:42:00.377
I APPRECIATE THAT. AND I'M

02:42:00.444 --> 02:42:01.711
HEARTENED TO HEAR THAT YOU

02:42:01.778 --> 02:42:05.682
BELIEVE THAT MANY OF THE. POLICY

02:42:05.749 --> 02:42:07.284
INNOVATIONS THAT WE WILL BE

02:42:07.350 --> 02:42:07.951
MOVING FORWARD WITH AS IT

02:42:08.018 --> 02:42:09.753
RELATES TO PRIOR AUTHORIZATION

02:42:09.820 --> 02:42:12.155
AND ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS

02:42:12.222 --> 02:42:13.690
AND PARTICIPATION IN THE DATA

02:42:13.757 --> 02:42:16.126
EXCHANGE AND OTHER OTHER THINGS,

02:42:16.193 --> 02:42:19.396
WILL AND OUR PRIOR AUTHORIZATION

02:42:19.463 --> 02:42:21.398
LEGISLATION, MUCH OF WHICH THIS

02:42:21.465 --> 02:42:24.034
AUTHOR HERE HAS MOVED FORWARD,

02:42:24.101 --> 02:42:25.936
WILL RESULT IN PERHAPS THAT NOT

02:42:26.002 --> 02:42:27.370
BEING SUCH AN INCREDIBLY HIGH

02:42:27.437 --> 02:42:29.005
NUMBER. BUT AS IT STANDS RIGHT

02:42:29.072 --> 02:42:31.608
NOW, IT IS TOO HIGH IN MY

02:42:31.675 --> 02:42:33.844
ESTIMATION. SENATOR, I JUST

02:42:33.910 --> 02:42:36.346
WANTED TO JUST GIVE YOU AN

02:42:36.413 --> 02:42:37.114
OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE

02:42:37.180 --> 02:42:38.515
CONCERN THAT I RAISED WITH YOU

02:42:38.582 --> 02:42:40.183
AND STAKEHOLDERS WHEN WE WERE

02:42:40.250 --> 02:42:43.520
ABLE TO MEET AROUND THE, THE

02:42:43.587 --> 02:42:44.988
NATURE OF THE VERY, VERY HIGH

02:42:45.055 --> 02:42:46.490
FINES. I KNOW THAT YOU ARE GOING

02:42:46.556 --> 02:42:48.992
TO BE CONTINUING TO BE IN

02:42:49.059 --> 02:42:51.061
CONVERSATION WITH DMHC ON THIS,

02:42:51.128 --> 02:42:52.662
AND WE'LL BE ABLE TO LAND IN A

02:42:52.729 --> 02:42:54.698
PLACE THAT IS RESPONSIVE TO THE

02:42:54.764 --> 02:42:56.099
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT DMHC

02:42:56.166 --> 02:42:58.835
HAS OFFERED, WHILE ALSO TAKING

02:42:58.902 --> 02:42:59.836
INTO ACCOUNT SOME OF THE

02:42:59.903 --> 02:43:00.904
CONCERNS THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAD

02:43:00.971 --> 02:43:03.773
AS WELL. YOU WANT TO ADDRESS

02:43:03.840 --> 02:43:06.610
THAT IN YOUR CLOSE. SURE. GREAT.

02:43:06.676 --> 02:43:08.712
AND FIRST OF ALL, I JUST WANT TO

02:43:08.778 --> 02:43:11.081
ALSO IF I BEFORE I GET TO THAT I

02:43:11.148 --> 02:43:13.650
APPRECIATE. SO I THINK WHAT MR.

02:43:13.717 --> 02:43:15.418
WAS SAYING IS THAT THERE ARE

02:43:15.485 --> 02:43:16.953
TIMES WHEN SOMEONE GOES TO THE

02:43:17.020 --> 02:43:18.688
INTERNAL GRIEF AT THE HEALTH

02:43:18.755 --> 02:43:20.390
PLAN AND LOSES, AND THEN THEY

02:43:20.457 --> 02:43:22.859
FILE AN EMR AND THEN THE HEALTH

02:43:22.926 --> 02:43:25.428
PLAN BEFORE THE IMR GETS

02:43:25.495 --> 02:43:27.931
ADJUDICATED REVERSES ITSELF. I

02:43:27.998 --> 02:43:28.999
BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT MORE OR LESS

02:43:29.065 --> 02:43:33.403
WHAT HE WAS, I THINK, AND THAT'S

02:43:33.470 --> 02:43:36.406
GREAT. IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO

02:43:36.473 --> 02:43:37.807
SELF-CORRECT WHEN ONE MAKES A

02:43:37.874 --> 02:43:39.576
MISTAKE, BUT IT DID REQUIRE THE

02:43:39.643 --> 02:43:41.411
PERSON TO GO THROUGH THAT WHOLE

02:43:41.478 --> 02:43:43.547
PROCESS AND FILE. AND MOST

02:43:43.613 --> 02:43:44.181
PEOPLE DON'T EVEN DO THAT. SO

02:43:44.247 --> 02:43:46.049
WHETHER OR NOT THE DEPARTMENT IS

02:43:46.116 --> 02:43:48.552
OVERTURNING OR WHETHER OR IF

02:43:48.618 --> 02:43:50.487
IT'S IF IT'S HAPPENING AT THAT

02:43:50.554 --> 02:43:51.755
STAGE, IT MEANS THAT SOMEONE WAS

02:43:51.821 --> 02:43:53.657
FORCED TO FILE FOR AN EMR. I

02:43:53.723 --> 02:43:55.625
JUST WANT TO SORT OF STATE THAT.

02:43:55.692 --> 02:43:56.693
AND MOST PEOPLE, AGAIN, DON'T

02:43:56.760 --> 02:43:58.595
EVEN KNOW THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO

02:43:58.662 --> 02:44:00.163
AN EMR. AND IT'S JUST VERY

02:44:00.230 --> 02:44:01.698
PROBLEMATIC IN TERMS OF THE SIZE

02:44:01.765 --> 02:44:04.067
OF THE FINE. AND WE'VE HAD THAT

02:44:04.134 --> 02:44:04.834
CONVERSATION. I APPRECIATE THAT,

02:44:04.901 --> 02:44:06.803
AND I APPRECIATE THE WORK AND

02:44:06.870 --> 02:44:09.372
THE ANALYSIS. AND AS MENTIONED,

02:44:09.439 --> 02:44:10.507
YOU KNOW, WE DID HAVE A

02:44:10.574 --> 02:44:12.642
REDUCTION IN SENATE HEALTH, AND

02:44:12.709 --> 02:44:13.777
IT IS SOMETHING WE'LL BE

02:44:13.843 --> 02:44:15.545
DISCUSSING WITH DMHC.

02:44:15.612 --> 02:44:17.414
ABSOLUTELY. AM I GO THERE'S NO

02:44:17.480 --> 02:44:19.449
NO NUMBER IS MAGICAL IN

02:44:19.516 --> 02:44:20.817
PARTICULAR, BUT IT'S JUST ABOUT

02:44:20.884 --> 02:44:22.452
MAKING SURE THAT IT'S HIGH

02:44:22.519 --> 02:44:23.587
ENOUGH THAT IT'S NOT A COST OF

02:44:23.653 --> 02:44:25.956
DOING BUSINESS OR VIEWED AS A

02:44:26.022 --> 02:44:27.591
COST OF DOING BUSINESS, AND THAT

02:44:27.657 --> 02:44:28.792
IT HAS A REAL IMPACT ON

02:44:28.858 --> 02:44:32.062
BEHAVIOR. SO WITH THAT, THIS IS

02:44:32.128 --> 02:44:34.598
ABOUT INCREASING ACCESS AND

02:44:34.664 --> 02:44:36.066
MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE ABLE

02:44:36.132 --> 02:44:37.500
TO GET THE BENEFITS THAT THEY

02:44:37.567 --> 02:44:38.902
DESERVE FROM THEIR HEALTH PLAN

02:44:38.969 --> 02:44:40.670
SO THAT THEY CAN STAY HEALTHY.

02:44:40.737 --> 02:44:42.005
AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN

02:44:42.072 --> 02:44:44.541
AYE VOTE. THANK YOU, SENATOR,

02:44:44.608 --> 02:44:48.578

WHEN WE HAVE QUORUM, WE WILL BE

02:44:50.914 --> 02:44:52.816
ABLE TO CONSIDER THAT THIS

02:44:52.882 --> 02:44:53.750
MEASURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

02:44:53.817 --> 02:44:56.987
THANK YOU. WE ARE GOING TO MOVE

02:44:57.053 --> 02:45:03.493

AND IS ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF

02:47:43.720 --> 02:47:45.422

CHANGES TO THOSE QUALIFICATIONS,

02:47:54.030 --> 02:47:55.465
AND IT WILL PROMOTE CONSISTENCY

02:47:55.532 --> 02:47:57.267

02:47:57.333 --> 02:47:58.568

NOT CREATE NEW REGULATORY

THOSE QUALIFICATIONS WITHOUT

02:48:25.361 --> 02:48:26.863
CAUSING DISRUPTION OR PREVENTING

FAMILIES FROM ACCESSING HIGH

02:48:28.331 --> 02:48:30.366
QUALITY CARE. ACCESS TO HIGH

02:48:30.433 --> 02:48:31.701
QUALITY CARE IS AN INTEGRAL PART

02:48:31.768 --> 02:48:34.037
OF CALABAR'S ACTIVITIES, AND SB

02:48:34.103 --> 02:48:35.905

TESTIMONY. FIRST, THIS IS REALLY

02:48:55.658 --> 02:48:57.927
DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT IF THERE

02:48:57.994 --> 02:49:00.296
WERE FUTURE CHANGES TO THE

02:49:00.363 --> 02:49:01.464
QUALIFICATIONS, THAT THOSE

02:49:01.531 --> 02:49:04.267
CHANGES WOULD BE CONSIDERED AND

02:49:04.334 --> 02:49:06.102

02:49:09.138 --> 02:49:11.107
PROPER DIALOG ON THESE VERY

02:49:11.174 --> 02:49:12.509

02:49:27.624 --> 02:49:28.725
CONTINUES TO BE UNDERWAY. AND WE

02:49:28.791 --> 02:49:31.594
DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS THIS

02:49:31.661 --> 02:49:32.128
LEGISLATION DISRUPTS THAT

02:49:32.195 --> 02:49:34.464

02:50:44.701 --> 02:50:46.436
THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR AND

COMMITTEE MEMBERS, I'M DOCTOR

02:50:48.037 --> 02:50:49.672
ANDREA DAVIS, LICENSED

02:50:49.739 --> 02:50:51.474
PSYCHOLOGIST, A MEMBER OF THE

02:50:51.541 --> 02:50:54.043
CALIFORNIA PSYCH ASSOCIATION AND

02:50:54.110 --> 02:50:55.478
THE PRESIDENT OF THE DIR.

02:50:55.545 --> 02:50:59.048
FLOORTIME COALITION AND OWNER OF

02:50:59.115 --> 02:51:01.150
GREENHOUSE THERAPY CENTER. SO

02:51:01.217 --> 02:51:02.986
I'M HERE TO REPRESENT THE MANY,

02:51:03.052 --> 02:51:06.189
MANY PARENTS WHO HAVE BEEN VERY

02:51:06.255 --> 02:51:07.590
CONCERNED ABOUT THIS BILL. I'VE

02:51:07.657 --> 02:51:10.193
SERVED SEVERAL THOUSAND FAMILIES

02:51:10.259 --> 02:51:11.628
OVER THE 30 YEARS, AND I'M

02:51:11.694 --> 02:51:14.197
CONCERNED FOR THEM. THE PROVIDER

02:51:14.263 --> 02:51:16.366
QUALIFICATIONS WERE DULY PLACED

02:51:16.432 --> 02:51:19.168
BY CODE EXPERTS IN LEDGE COUNSEL

02:51:19.235 --> 02:51:20.770
FOR GOOD REASON. THEY SHOULD

02:51:20.837 --> 02:51:23.139
STAY PUT. THEY WERE DELIBERATELY

02:51:23.206 --> 02:51:26.376
PLACED THERE IN 2011 SO THAT

02:51:26.442 --> 02:51:28.911
DMHC, CDI AND THE HEALTH

02:51:28.978 --> 02:51:30.980
COMMITTEES WOULD PROVIDE THE

02:51:31.047 --> 02:51:32.215
EXPERIENCED OVERSIGHT AND

02:51:32.281 --> 02:51:36.386
REGULATION. THE PROBLEM NOW IS

02:51:36.452 --> 02:51:37.887
AUTISM PROVIDERS ARE IN

02:51:37.954 --> 02:51:40.123
DESPERATELY SHORT SUPPLY.

02:51:40.189 --> 02:51:41.024
PARENTS ARE SITTING ON WAIT

02:51:41.090 --> 02:51:43.593
LISTS FOR YEARS, THEIR DOCTORS

02:51:43.660 --> 02:51:45.361
TELLING THEM EARLY INTERVENTION

02:51:45.428 --> 02:51:48.598
IS KEY AND THEY FEEL THE CLOCK

02:51:48.665 --> 02:51:50.133
TICKING, ESPECIALLY THOSE

02:51:50.199 --> 02:51:51.200
FAMILIES WHO ARE DISADVANTAGED

02:51:51.267 --> 02:51:54.737
IN THIS STATE. SB 402 DOESN'T

02:51:54.804 --> 02:51:57.674
HELP. IT DOES NOTHING TO FIX OR

02:51:57.740 --> 02:52:00.410
SOLVE THE SITUATION. IT DOESN'T

02:52:00.476 --> 02:52:02.311
DO ANYTHING TO THE

02:52:02.378 --> 02:52:03.012
QUALIFICATIONS, THE BILLS

02:52:03.079 --> 02:52:04.614
BROUGHT BY A SPONSOR WHO IS

02:52:04.681 --> 02:52:06.249
OPPOSED. SEVERAL BILLS THAT

02:52:06.315 --> 02:52:08.518
WOULD INCLUDE MORE PROVIDERS

02:52:08.584 --> 02:52:09.886
CLAIMING THAT WOULD LOWER

02:52:09.952 --> 02:52:11.287
STANDARDS, BUT ACTUALLY

02:52:11.354 --> 02:52:12.789
REPRESENTING MONEY AND BUSINESS

02:52:12.855 --> 02:52:13.856
INTERESTS, AND BEING THE ONLY

02:52:13.923 --> 02:52:16.325
TREATMENT CHOICE AND THE ONLY

02:52:16.392 --> 02:52:18.127
CERTIFICATION ROUTE. BUT PARENTS

02:52:18.194 --> 02:52:20.163
NEED TREATMENT CHOICES, AND THEY

02:52:20.229 --> 02:52:22.498
NEED CHOICES THAT WORK FOR THEIR

02:52:22.565 --> 02:52:25.034
CHILD. SO PARENTS ARE VERY

02:52:25.101 --> 02:52:27.336
SUSPICIOUS. THEY'RE ASKING IF

02:52:27.403 --> 02:52:29.305
THE BILL DOESN'T FIX ANYTHING,

02:52:29.372 --> 02:52:32.709
WHY IS IT BEING BROUGHT? PARENTS

02:52:32.775 --> 02:52:34.844
ARE WORRIED THE SPONSORS ARE UP

02:52:34.911 --> 02:52:36.546
TO BLOCKING ACCESS AGAIN. THE

02:52:36.612 --> 02:52:38.314
SPONSORS HAVE MISREPRESENTED THE

02:52:38.381 --> 02:52:40.249
SCIENCE FOR YEARS, CLAIMING THEY

02:52:40.316 --> 02:52:41.951
HAVE THE ONLY EVIDENCE BASED

02:52:42.018 --> 02:52:45.154
METHOD. MOVING THE REGULATIONS

02:52:45.221 --> 02:52:47.490
PAVES THE PATH PATH FOR

02:52:47.557 --> 02:52:49.125
LICENSING THEIR GROUP OF

02:52:49.192 --> 02:52:51.594
PROVIDERS, BUT EXCLUDING OTHER

02:52:51.661 --> 02:52:54.097
QUALIFIED PROVIDERS. THAT WOULD

02:52:54.163 --> 02:52:55.965
WORSEN THE CRISIS. SO THANK YOU

02:52:56.032 --> 02:52:59.035
FOR THESE PARENTS. PLEASE VOTE

02:52:59.102 --> 02:53:03.539
NO. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON,

02:53:03.606 --> 02:53:05.108
MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE. MY

02:53:05.174 --> 02:53:06.709
NAME IS MARIANA GARCIA AND I'M

02:53:06.776 --> 02:53:08.511
HERE TODAY REPRESENTING THE

02:53:08.578 --> 02:53:10.580
AUTISM BUSINESS ASSOCIATION TO

02:53:10.646 --> 02:53:12.715
SHARE OUR CONCERNS REGARDING SB

02:53:12.782 --> 02:53:14.383
402 AND ITS IMPLICATIONS ù

02:53:14.450 --> 02:53:16.152
AUTISM SERVICE PROVIDERS AND THE

02:53:16.219 --> 02:53:17.720
BROADER, BROADER AUTISM

02:53:17.787 --> 02:53:20.490
COMMUNITY. WE APPRECIATE SENATOR

02:53:20.556 --> 02:53:21.791
BALDERAS ATTENTION AND INTEREST

02:53:21.858 --> 02:53:23.593
IN THE WELL-BEING OF INDIVIDUALS

02:53:23.659 --> 02:53:25.328
WITH AUTISM. HOWEVER, WE WOULD

02:53:25.394 --> 02:53:26.596
LIKE TO RESPECTFULLY HIGHLIGHT

02:53:26.662 --> 02:53:28.731
THAT THIS PROPOSED LEGISLATION

02:53:28.798 --> 02:53:31.234
DOES NOT SEEM TO OFFER

02:53:31.300 --> 02:53:31.868
MEASURABLE BENEFITS TO THE VERY

02:53:31.934 --> 02:53:34.137
COMMUNITY IT SEEKS TO SERVE.

02:53:34.203 --> 02:53:35.505
SPECIFICALLY, AS NOTED BY THE

02:53:35.571 --> 02:53:37.306
SENATE COUNSEL AND THE AUTISM

02:53:37.373 --> 02:53:38.775
SOCIETY, IT REMAINS UNCLEAR

02:53:38.841 --> 02:53:41.344
WHETHER THE PROPOSED CHANGES,

02:53:41.410 --> 02:53:43.179
INCLUDING AN UPDATED CODE

02:53:43.246 --> 02:53:44.614
PLACEMENT, ARE NECESSARY OR

02:53:44.680 --> 02:53:46.048
BENEFICIAL TO QUALIFIED AUTISM

02:53:46.115 --> 02:53:48.151
SERVICE PROVIDERS. THERE IS NO

02:53:48.217 --> 02:53:49.685
EVIDENCE THAT THE BILL ENHANCES

02:53:49.752 --> 02:53:51.454
OVERSIGHT OR ACCOUNTABILITY FOR

02:53:51.521 --> 02:53:52.889
PROVIDERS, NOR DOES IT

02:53:52.955 --> 02:53:55.091
MEANINGFULLY IMPROVE CONSUMER

02:53:55.158 --> 02:53:56.459
PROTECTIONS. FURTHERMORE, THERE

02:53:56.526 --> 02:53:58.027
ARE VALID CONCERNS THAT

02:53:58.094 --> 02:53:59.362
TRANSFERRING CODE PROVISIONS

02:53:59.428 --> 02:54:00.730
FROM THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE

02:54:00.797 --> 02:54:02.999
AND INSURANCE CODE TO THE

02:54:03.065 --> 02:54:04.467
BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE

02:54:04.534 --> 02:54:05.535
COULD INADVERTENTLY CREATE

02:54:05.601 --> 02:54:07.603
HARMFUL ROADBLOCKS TO ACCESSING

02:54:07.670 --> 02:54:10.840
CRITICAL SERVICES AT THIS TIME.

02:54:10.907 --> 02:54:11.941
WHEN FAMILIES IN AUTISM

02:54:12.008 --> 02:54:13.075
COMMUNITIES FACE NUMEROUS

02:54:13.142 --> 02:54:14.744
CHALLENGES NAVIGATING CARE AND

02:54:14.811 --> 02:54:16.312
SERVICES, IT'S CRUCIAL THAT WE

02:54:16.379 --> 02:54:18.114
FOCUS ON PROPOSALS THAT DELIVER

02:54:18.181 --> 02:54:20.249
CLEAR, ACTIONABLE BENEFITS. THIS

02:54:20.316 --> 02:54:21.551
BILL, UNFORTUNATELY FALLS SHORT

02:54:21.617 --> 02:54:23.186
IN ADDRESSING THE PRESSING NEEDS

02:54:23.252 --> 02:54:25.288
AND PRIORITIES OF OUR COMMUNITY.

02:54:25.354 --> 02:54:26.355
INSTEAD OF MOVING FORWARD WITH

02:54:26.422 --> 02:54:27.723
LEGISLATION THAT LACKS

02:54:27.790 --> 02:54:29.625
MEASURABLE, MEASURABLE IMPACT,

02:54:29.692 --> 02:54:31.494
WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO

02:54:31.561 --> 02:54:32.829
COLLABORATE WITH SENATOR

02:54:32.895 --> 02:54:34.297
BALDERAS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS

02:54:34.363 --> 02:54:35.798
ON INITIATIVES THAT TRULY

02:54:35.865 --> 02:54:38.267
ADVANCE THE QUALITY, ACCESS AND

02:54:38.334 --> 02:54:39.335
ACCOUNTABILITY OF SERVICE FOR

02:54:39.402 --> 02:54:41.170
INDIVIDUALS WITH AUTISM. THANK

COMMITTEE MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU.

02:54:47.577 --> 02:54:49.111
ANY OTHERS IN THE HEARING ROOM

02:54:49.178 --> 02:54:52.248
WHO ARE OPPOSED TO THIS MEASURE?

02:54:52.315 --> 02:54:56.586
PLEASE COME FORWARD. GOOD

02:54:56.652 --> 02:54:58.020

OR COMMENTS. WHILE WE ARE

02:55:22.245 --> 02:55:24.347
THINKING, SENATOR, DO YOU MIND

02:55:24.413 --> 02:55:25.815
ACTUALLY JUST ADDRESSING THE

02:55:25.882 --> 02:55:28.351
OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS? YES, I

I'D LIKE THE SPONSORS TO WEIGH

IN AS WELL. YOU KNOW, SINCE I

HAVE BEEN A LONG TIME AUTISM

CHILDREN WERE DIAGNOSED ON THE

AUTISM SPECTRUM. TODAY, IT'S ONE

INCH 31. WHEN SHE WAS DIAGNOSED,

02:55:51.240 --> 02:55:53.109
THE ONLY REAL THE REAL TREATMENT

02:55:53.175 --> 02:55:54.877
WAS ABA. NOW WE HAVE SPEECH

02:56:00.549 --> 02:56:04.220
HAVE COME SO FAR IN JUST UNDER

02:56:04.287 --> 02:56:06.756
TWO DECADES. AND IT IS

02:56:06.822 --> 02:56:09.292
IMPERATIVE THAT AS RESEARCH, AS

02:56:09.358 --> 02:56:11.894
SCIENCE, AS THIS INDUSTRY AND

02:56:11.961 --> 02:56:13.629
THIS AND THESE SERVICES AND

02:56:13.696 --> 02:56:15.531
THERAPIES CONTINUE TO GROW AND

02:56:15.598 --> 02:56:17.366
ADVANCE THAT, THEY'RE PLACED IN

02:56:17.433 --> 02:56:19.468
THE RIGHT SECTION OF CODE TO DO,

02:56:19.535 --> 02:56:21.604
DO DO SO, INCLUDING IT'S

02:56:21.671 --> 02:56:22.772
IMPERATIVE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

02:56:22.838 --> 02:56:24.840
THE SHORTAGE OF PROVIDERS, IT'S

02:56:24.907 --> 02:56:26.809
BECAUSE WE HAVE A WORKFORCE

02:56:26.876 --> 02:56:27.810
SHORTAGE. AND THE WAY THAT WE

02:56:27.877 --> 02:56:29.912
CAN FOCUS ON GROWING THAT

02:56:29.979 --> 02:56:31.714
WORKFORCE IS THROUGH MOVING THIS

02:56:31.781 --> 02:56:34.150
INTO THE RIGHT SECTION OF CODE.

02:56:34.216 --> 02:56:36.819
WOULD ALSO LIKE THE TECHNICAL

02:56:36.886 --> 02:56:38.487
ASPECT. YEAH. THANK YOU VERY

02:56:38.554 --> 02:56:40.323
MUCH. APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY

02:56:40.389 --> 02:56:41.123
TO RESPOND. YOU KNOW, FIRST I'LL

02:56:41.190 --> 02:56:43.626
JUST SAY KALABA IS A MADE UP OF

02:56:43.693 --> 02:56:45.227
PROVIDERS. AND ACCESS TO CARE IS

02:56:45.294 --> 02:56:46.829
A VERY IMPORTANT GOAL OF THEM.

02:56:46.896 --> 02:56:48.597
THEY WORK OF THEIRS. EXCUSE ME.

02:56:48.664 --> 02:56:50.733
THEY WORK ON MANY DIFFERENT

02:56:50.800 --> 02:56:52.601
PRIORITIES THAT ARE RELATED TO

02:56:52.668 --> 02:56:55.071
ACCESS TO CARE. SO I FIRST JUST

02:56:55.137 --> 02:56:56.605
WANT TO START WITH THAT. SECOND,

02:56:56.672 --> 02:57:00.176
I DO THINK THAT THE ASSERTION

02:57:00.242 --> 02:57:02.244
THAT THIS WAS PUT IN THE CODE

02:57:02.311 --> 02:57:03.612
SECTION AND ONLY IN THE HEALTH

02:57:03.679 --> 02:57:05.181
AND SAFETY CODE, WITH THOUGHTFUL

02:57:05.247 --> 02:57:07.149
CARE AND ATTENTION, I THINK THAT

02:57:07.216 --> 02:57:10.152
WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS

02:57:10.219 --> 02:57:12.321
THIS LEGISLATION IS ONLY IN THE

02:57:12.388 --> 02:57:13.422
HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE RIGHT

02:57:13.489 --> 02:57:15.758
NOW. BUT MANY OF THE PROVIDERS

02:57:15.825 --> 02:57:17.860
OF CARE WHO DO THIS SORT OF WORK

02:57:17.927 --> 02:57:19.228
THAT ARE REFERENCED IN

02:57:19.295 --> 02:57:21.097
SUBSECTION B, PHYSICIANS AND

02:57:21.163 --> 02:57:22.398
SURGEONS, PHYSICAL THERAPISTS,

02:57:22.465 --> 02:57:23.733
OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS,

02:57:23.799 --> 02:57:26.068
PSYCHOLOGISTS, MFTS, ETC. THOSE

02:57:26.135 --> 02:57:28.170
ARE ALREADY REGULATED BY THE

02:57:28.237 --> 02:57:29.205
BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE

02:57:29.271 --> 02:57:31.273
AND HAVE LANGUAGE IN THAT

02:57:31.340 --> 02:57:33.175
SECTION RELATED TO THOSE

02:57:33.242 --> 02:57:34.910
PROFESSIONS. IN ADDITION, THIS

02:57:34.977 --> 02:57:38.614
DOESN'T DISRUPT THE REFERENCE IN

02:57:38.681 --> 02:57:39.882
THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE AND

02:57:39.949 --> 02:57:41.817
THE INSURANCE CODE. THE MANDATE

02:57:41.884 --> 02:57:43.219
FOR COVERAGE IS STILL THERE,

02:57:43.285 --> 02:57:45.021
WITH A CROSS REFERENCE TO THE

02:57:45.087 --> 02:57:47.323
BNP CODE, TO ENSURE THAT BOTH

02:57:47.390 --> 02:57:48.758
COMMITTEES WOULD REMAIN TO HAVE

02:57:48.824 --> 02:57:49.425
OVERSIGHT OVER THAT. THAT'S

02:57:49.492 --> 02:57:50.726
SOMETHING THAT WE DO IN STATUTE

02:57:50.793 --> 02:57:52.595
ALL THE TIME. WE DON'T NEED

02:57:52.661 --> 02:57:54.030
REDUNDANCIES OR MULTIPLE

02:57:54.096 --> 02:57:55.598
DEFINITIONS. SO IF WE HAVE A

02:57:55.664 --> 02:57:56.966
DEFINITION IN ONE PART OF THE

02:57:57.033 --> 02:57:59.468
CODE, WE CAN REFERENCE THAT

02:57:59.535 --> 02:58:01.537
RATHER THAN KEEPING IT IN THE

02:58:01.604 --> 02:58:02.705
HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE. SO WE

02:58:02.772 --> 02:58:05.007
WERE VERY CAREFUL WHEN WE WORKED

02:58:05.074 --> 02:58:06.042
WITH SENATOR VELARDE'S, HER

02:58:06.108 --> 02:58:07.476
STAFF, HER OFFICE AND LEDGE

02:58:07.543 --> 02:58:08.944
COUNSEL TO ENSURE THAT WE DID

02:58:09.011 --> 02:58:11.680
NOT DISRUPT THE EXISTING LAW

02:58:11.747 --> 02:58:13.916
AROUND THE QUALIFICATIONS AND

02:58:13.983 --> 02:58:15.751
SERVICES. AND REALLY, JUST IN

02:58:15.818 --> 02:58:18.287
OUR MIND, DID WHAT WE SEE A BIT

02:58:18.354 --> 02:58:20.056
OF A TECHNICAL CLEANUP TO ENSURE

02:58:20.122 --> 02:58:21.757
THAT THERE'S APPROPRIATE

02:58:21.824 --> 02:58:22.792
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OVER THESE

02:58:22.858 --> 02:58:26.529
ISSUES. THANK YOU, I APPRECIATE

02:58:26.595 --> 02:58:29.298
THAT. I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER

02:58:29.365 --> 02:58:30.800
COMMITTEE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS.

02:58:30.866 --> 02:58:34.336
WE DO HAVE QUORUM, SO I'M GOING

02:58:34.403 --> 02:58:35.638

02:58:35.704 --> 02:58:37.907
ESTABLISH QUORUM BEFORE WE ALLOW

02:58:37.973 --> 02:58:43.879

02:59:21.817 --> 02:59:22.885
IN THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE

02:59:22.952 --> 02:59:24.720
HAD WITH STAKEHOLDERS, A LOT OF

02:59:24.787 --> 02:59:26.322

PRESENT TO YOU SB 533, WHICH

03:07:23.699 --> 03:07:25.534
WILL STRENGTHEN ACCESS TO

MEDI-CAL PROVIDERS BY PRESERVING

03:07:27.970 --> 03:07:30.105
ALTERNATIVE ACCESS STANDARDS AND

03:07:30.172 --> 03:07:32.341
INCREASED TRANSPARENCY FOR

03:07:32.407 --> 03:07:34.576
FUTURE STANDARDS. ACCESS TO

03:07:34.643 --> 03:07:36.945
COVERED SERVICES IS A PERSISTENT

03:07:37.012 --> 03:07:38.380
PROBLEM FOR ALL PATIENTS, BUT

03:07:38.447 --> 03:07:40.983
EVEN GREATER FOR MEDI-CAL

RECIPIENTS ENROLLED IN MANAGED

03:07:42.818 --> 03:07:47.189

03:07:47.255 --> 03:07:50.559
PASSED AB 205 BY WOULD CHAPTER

03:07:50.626 --> 03:07:52.728

03:07:52.794 --> 03:07:54.930
MANAGED CARE PLANS TO MAINTAIN A

03:07:54.997 --> 03:07:57.265

SPECIFIC TIME AND DISTANCE

03:07:59.401 --> 03:08:01.136
STANDARDS. YET THERE HAS BEEN AN

03:08:01.203 --> 03:08:03.171
INCREASING VOLUME IN MEDI-CAL

03:08:03.238 --> 03:08:05.741
ALTERNATIVE ACCESS REQUESTS AND

03:08:05.807 --> 03:08:07.909
APPROVALS. IN 2023, THE

03:08:07.976 --> 03:08:09.778
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

03:08:09.845 --> 03:08:11.913

03:08:11.980 --> 03:08:13.682

03:08:18.186 --> 03:08:20.522
WERE APPROVED. APPROVAL OF THESE

03:08:20.589 --> 03:08:22.357
REQUESTS MEANS THAT MEDI-CAL

03:08:22.424 --> 03:08:24.426
PATIENTS OFTEN MUST TRAVEL

03:08:24.493 --> 03:08:26.294
FARTHER OR LONGER THAN THE STATE

03:08:26.361 --> 03:08:28.397
LAW REQUIRES JUST TO ACCESS

03:08:28.463 --> 03:08:30.332
CARE. RESEARCH INDICATES THERE

03:08:30.399 --> 03:08:32.401
IS AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN

03:08:32.467 --> 03:08:34.670
INCREASING TIME OR DISTANCE TO

03:08:34.736 --> 03:08:36.672
HEALTHCARE AND INCREASING WORSE

03:08:36.738 --> 03:08:40.342
HEALTH CARE OUTCOMES, WITH OVER

03:08:40.409 --> 03:08:41.710
ONE THIRD OF CALIFORNIANS

03:08:41.777 --> 03:08:43.245
RECEIVING HEALTH CARE COVERAGE

03:08:43.311 --> 03:08:45.881
THROUGH MEDI-CAL AND ROUGHLY 94%

03:08:45.947 --> 03:08:48.250
OF MEDI-CAL RECIPIENTS RECEIVING

03:08:48.316 --> 03:08:50.052
THEIR CARE THROUGH MANAGED CARE

03:08:50.118 --> 03:08:51.787
SYSTEM, IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE

03:08:51.853 --> 03:08:54.256
ENSURE TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE.

03:08:54.322 --> 03:08:56.124
THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN

03:08:56.191 --> 03:08:57.926
PRESENTED ARE IN CONJUNCTION

03:08:57.993 --> 03:09:00.128
FROM THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE

03:09:00.195 --> 03:09:01.563
STAFF, AND THE AMENDMENTS WERE

03:09:01.630 --> 03:09:03.432
TAKEN TO REFLECT THE WORK OF THE

03:09:03.498 --> 03:09:05.133
COMMITTEE STAFF AND THE

03:09:05.200 --> 03:09:06.668
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

03:09:06.735 --> 03:09:09.771
SERVICES. IN ANY OPPOSITION, THE

03:09:09.838 --> 03:09:11.273
KEY THINGS THAT WE FOCUSED ON

03:09:11.339 --> 03:09:13.475
WERE NUMBER ONE, TO EXTEND THE

03:09:13.542 --> 03:09:15.944
SUNSET ANOTHER THREE YEARS, THAT

03:09:16.011 --> 03:09:16.945
AMENDMENTS BEFORE YOU WOULD

03:09:17.012 --> 03:09:19.214
PRESERVE STANDARDS AND INCREASE

03:09:19.281 --> 03:09:21.349
TRANSPARENCY IN THE PROCESS TO

03:09:21.416 --> 03:09:23.151
DEVELOP FUTURE STANDARDS. AND

03:09:23.218 --> 03:09:25.454
THEN FINALLY, THE STANDARDS THAT

03:09:25.520 --> 03:09:27.456
THEY WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY

03:09:27.522 --> 03:09:28.924
UPDATED. SINCE THIS LAW WAS

03:09:28.990 --> 03:09:30.792
FIRST ESTABLISHED OVER EIGHT

03:09:30.859 --> 03:09:33.261
YEARS AGO. FINALLY, THIS BILL

03:09:33.328 --> 03:09:34.996
REPRESENTS A CRITICAL STEP IN

03:09:35.063 --> 03:09:36.465
ENSURING THAT CALIFORNIA

03:09:36.531 --> 03:09:38.700
MEDI-CAL PATIENTS, OUR FRIENDS,

03:09:38.767 --> 03:09:41.236
OUR FAMILY, OUR NEIGHBORS WOULD

03:09:41.303 --> 03:09:43.305
HAVE GREATER RECOVERY AND IN

03:09:43.371 --> 03:09:45.173
FACT, WOULD ALSO IT WOULD COST

03:09:45.240 --> 03:09:47.042
LESS BECAUSE THEY WOULD GET HELP

03:09:47.109 --> 03:09:49.044
SOONER. WITH THAT, I HAVE BEFORE

03:09:49.111 --> 03:09:52.280

OFFER TIMELY APPOINTMENTS WITH

03:10:34.856 --> 03:10:36.124
IN-NETWORK PROVIDERS, CONSUMERS

03:10:36.191 --> 03:10:37.692
ARE LEFT WITHOUT THE CARE THAT

03:10:39.261 --> 03:10:40.595

THEY'RE ENTITLED TO. TO PROVIDE

03:10:46.067 --> 03:10:47.435
AN EXAMPLE, I HAD A SENIOR

03:10:47.502 --> 03:10:48.570
CLIENT WHO SUFFERS FROM A

03:10:48.637 --> 03:10:49.571
SERIOUS RESPIRATORY CONDITION

03:10:49.638 --> 03:10:51.072
THAT LEFT HER STRUGGLING TO

03:10:51.139 --> 03:10:52.407
BREATHE. SHE REQUIRED A VERY

03:10:52.474 --> 03:10:54.309
SPECIALIZED SURGERY FROM AN ENT.

03:10:54.376 --> 03:10:56.077
HER HEALTH PLAN REFERRED HER TO

03:10:56.144 --> 03:10:57.579
AN IN-NETWORK SURGEON IN MARCH

03:10:57.646 --> 03:10:58.880
2024, BUT THE APPOINTMENT SHE

03:10:58.947 --> 03:11:00.382
WAS OFFERED JUST FOR

03:11:00.448 --> 03:11:02.150
CONSULTATION WAS NOT UNTIL

03:11:02.217 --> 03:11:03.285
JANUARY 2025. DURING THIS TIME,

03:11:03.351 --> 03:11:04.286
MY CLIENT'S OVERALL HEALTH

03:11:04.352 --> 03:11:05.720
DECLINED. SHE'S UNABLE TO GET A

03:11:05.787 --> 03:11:07.789
SLEEP APNEA TÍNH UNTIL SHE

03:11:07.856 --> 03:11:08.924
RECEIVES SURGERY, SO SHE HAS

03:11:08.990 --> 03:11:10.926
SPENT THE LAST YEAR BARELY ABLE

03:11:10.992 --> 03:11:11.793
TO SLEEP. WHILE WAITING FOR THE

03:11:11.860 --> 03:11:13.094
JANUARY APPOINTMENT, MY CLIENT

03:11:13.161 --> 03:11:14.796
WAS ABLE TO FIND ANOTHER SURGEON

03:11:14.863 --> 03:11:15.630
WHO COULD SCHEDULE A

03:11:15.697 --> 03:11:17.566
CONSULTATION WITHIN TEN DAYS.

03:11:17.632 --> 03:11:18.633
UNFORTUNATELY, THIS PROVIDER WAS

03:11:18.700 --> 03:11:19.634
OUT OF NETWORK AND MY CLIENT'S

03:11:19.701 --> 03:11:21.236
MEDI-CAL PLAN DENIED THE

03:11:21.303 --> 03:11:22.170
REFERRAL. WE HELPED THIS

03:11:22.237 --> 03:11:23.972
CONSUMER FILE AN APPEAL WITH HER

03:11:24.039 --> 03:11:24.639
MEDI-CAL PLAN, ARGUING THAT

03:11:24.706 --> 03:11:26.541
BECAUSE THE PLAN COULD NOT OFFER

03:11:26.608 --> 03:11:27.909
HER A TIMELY APPOINTMENT IN

03:11:27.976 --> 03:11:28.977
NETWORK, IT WAS REQUIRED TO

03:11:29.044 --> 03:11:30.145
AUTHORIZE CARE OUT OF NETWORK.

03:11:30.212 --> 03:11:31.513
FORTUNATELY, DUE TO THE EXISTING

03:11:31.580 --> 03:11:32.614
NETWORK ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS,

03:11:32.681 --> 03:11:33.949
THE HEALTH PLAN AGREED TO COVER

03:11:34.015 --> 03:11:35.917
THE OUT-OF-NETWORK SURGEON. TO

03:11:35.984 --> 03:11:36.952
PROVIDE ANOTHER EXAMPLE, I HAVE

03:11:37.018 --> 03:11:38.787
A CLIENT WITH LYMPHEDEMA WHO

03:11:38.854 --> 03:11:39.554
REQUIRES A PHYSICAL THERAPIST TO

03:11:39.621 --> 03:11:40.956
TREAT HER CONDITION. SHE

03:11:41.022 --> 03:11:43.258
REQUESTED A PHYSICAL THERAPIST

03:11:43.325 --> 03:11:43.792
IN MARCH 2024 AND DID NOT

03:11:43.859 --> 03:11:46.294
RECEIVE AN APPOINTMENT UNTIL

03:11:46.361 --> 03:11:47.062
MARCH 2025. FOR THE LAST YEAR,

03:11:47.128 --> 03:11:48.563
THE CLIENT HAS BEEN PAYING OUT

03:11:48.630 --> 03:11:49.731
OF POCKET FOR THIS MEDICALLY

03:11:49.798 --> 03:11:50.999
NECESSARY SERVICE. WHEN SHE

03:11:51.066 --> 03:11:52.033
FINALLY SAW THE PHYSICAL

03:11:52.100 --> 03:11:52.868

03:11:52.934 --> 03:11:54.769
A SUITABLE PROVIDER AND SHE IS

03:11:54.836 --> 03:11:56.504

03:12:07.515 --> 03:12:09.384
REMAINS A PERSISTENT ISSUE

03:12:09.451 --> 03:12:10.886
WITHIN MEDI-CAL HEALTH PLANS.

03:12:10.952 --> 03:12:12.621

RELY ON MEDI-CAL PLANS TO

03:12:48.390 --> 03:12:50.158

EIGHT YEARS AGO. SB 530 WOULD

03:13:02.003 --> 03:13:03.705
NOT ONLY EXTEND THESE CRUCIAL

03:13:03.772 --> 03:13:04.806

AND UPDATING THESE TIME AND

03:13:17.452 --> 03:13:18.987

03:13:19.054 --> 03:13:20.588
TO ENSURE MEDI-CAL PLAN

03:13:20.655 --> 03:13:22.791

HAVE EXCESSIVE WAIT TIMES FOR

03:13:26.261 --> 03:13:27.829

AMENDMENTS REMOVE OPPOSITION

03:14:00.362 --> 03:14:01.997

03:18:52.987 --> 03:18:54.989
OFFERED IN THE ANALYSIS. THE

03:18:55.056 --> 03:18:56.190
AMENDMENTS ARE, NUMBER ONE, THAT

03:18:56.257 --> 03:18:58.159
WE WANTED TO NARROW THE

03:18:58.226 --> 03:19:00.028
PROVISIONS TO DELETE INTENSIVE

03:19:00.094 --> 03:19:02.230
OUTPATIENT THERAPY TO ALIGN WITH

03:19:02.297 --> 03:19:04.399
THE CURRENT LAW REQUIREMENTS.

03:19:04.465 --> 03:19:06.901
NUMBER TWO, TO CLARIFY THAT

03:19:06.968 --> 03:19:09.470
COVERAGE FOR AT LEAST ONE FDA

03:19:09.537 --> 03:19:12.407
APPROVED ANTI-OBESITY MEDICATION

03:19:12.473 --> 03:19:14.175
DOES NOT LIMIT EXISTING

03:19:14.242 --> 03:19:15.076
DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH

03:19:15.143 --> 03:19:18.112
CARE REGULATIONS FOR MORBID

03:19:18.179 --> 03:19:20.915
OBESITY. NUMBER THREE TO REWORD

03:19:20.982 --> 03:19:22.750
LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND

03:19:22.817 --> 03:19:23.851
DECLARATIONS. AND FINALLY,

03:19:23.918 --> 03:19:25.653
NUMBER FOUR, TO UPDATE THE NAME

03:19:25.720 --> 03:19:28.156
OF THE BILL TO OBESITY CARE

03:19:28.222 --> 03:19:32.093
ACCESS ACT. IN ADDITION TO THOSE

03:19:32.160 --> 03:19:33.561
AMENDMENTS, A FEW THINGS TO

03:19:33.628 --> 03:19:36.064
COVER. NOW MORE THAN EVER, SB

03:19:36.130 --> 03:19:38.666
535 IS NEEDED, AS WE'VE HAD TWO

03:19:38.733 --> 03:19:40.935
YEARS OF DATA FROM TREATMENTS TO

03:19:41.002 --> 03:19:43.304
SHOW THAT OBESITY CAN BE REDUCED

03:19:43.371 --> 03:19:45.373
AND ADDITIONAL HEALTH ISSUES

03:19:45.440 --> 03:19:47.909
SUCH AS DIABETES AND CARDIAC

03:19:47.975 --> 03:19:50.178
ILLNESS CAN BE IMPROVED. IN

03:19:50.244 --> 03:19:51.979
ADDITION TO WEIGHT LOSS AND

03:19:52.046 --> 03:19:54.749
MANAGEMENT, OBESITY IS A SERIOUS

03:19:54.816 --> 03:19:56.818
DISEASE FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS.

03:19:56.884 --> 03:19:58.186
WE'VE LEARNED OVER THE YEARS

03:19:58.252 --> 03:20:00.288
THIS DISEASE IS NOT SOMETHING

03:20:00.355 --> 03:20:02.390
THAT NECESSARILY CAN BE

03:20:02.457 --> 03:20:04.926
CONTROLLED SIMPLY BY HOW MUCH

03:20:04.992 --> 03:20:07.895
ONE EATS, OR THEY EXERCISE 1 IN

03:20:07.962 --> 03:20:10.631
4. THAT'S 25% OF ADULTS IN

03:20:10.698 --> 03:20:12.400
CALIFORNIA ARE STRUGGLING WITH

03:20:12.467 --> 03:20:15.670
OBESITY, AND APPROXIMATELY 11.7%

03:20:15.737 --> 03:20:17.839
OF ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE

03:20:17.905 --> 03:20:20.375
RELATED COMORBIDITIES, SUCH AS

03:20:20.441 --> 03:20:23.845
TYPE TWO DIABETES. CURRENTLY,

03:20:23.911 --> 03:20:26.114
MOST HEALTH COVERAGES DO NOT

03:20:26.180 --> 03:20:28.282
INCLUDE INDIVIDUALS CONSIDERED

03:20:28.349 --> 03:20:30.017
OBESE, WHICH ACTUALLY STARTS AT

03:20:30.084 --> 03:20:33.721
30 BMI AND GREATER, TRANSLATING

03:20:33.788 --> 03:20:35.556
TO THOSE WHO MAY NOT BE

03:20:35.623 --> 03:20:37.592
FAMILIAR. WHAT THAT MEANS A 30

03:20:37.658 --> 03:20:39.427
BMI CAN TYPICALLY BE A PERSON

03:20:39.494 --> 03:20:42.663
COULD BE MORE THAN 100 POUNDS

03:20:42.730 --> 03:20:44.031
OVERWEIGHT, AND THE INSURANCE

03:20:44.098 --> 03:20:46.334
COMPANIES THUS FAR HAVE BEEN

03:20:46.401 --> 03:20:49.070
REQUIRING A BMI OF 40. SO THAT

03:20:49.137 --> 03:20:51.639
IS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE.

03:20:51.706 --> 03:20:54.542
EVEN THOUGH REDUCING BMI BY 0.5,

03:20:54.609 --> 03:20:58.913
THE HEALTH INDUSTRY SAU

03:20:58.980 --> 03:21:00.314
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT WE COULD

03:21:00.381 --> 03:21:03.651
POTENTIALLY SAVE $81.7 BILLION

03:21:03.718 --> 03:21:06.521
IN HEALTH RELATED COSTS BY 2030,

03:21:06.587 --> 03:21:08.289
NOT TO MENTION, MOST

03:21:08.356 --> 03:21:09.824
IMPORTANTLY, IMPROVING THE

03:21:09.891 --> 03:21:12.260
QUALITY OF LIFE OF INDIVIDUALS.

03:21:12.326 --> 03:21:14.796
SB 535 WILL PROVIDE

03:21:14.862 --> 03:21:16.631
COMPREHENSIVE OPTIONS TO THOSE

03:21:16.697 --> 03:21:19.100
STRUGGLING WITH OBESITY BY

03:21:19.167 --> 03:21:21.936
REQUIRING COVERAGE FOR BARIATRIC

03:21:22.003 --> 03:21:24.071
SURGERY AND AT LEAST ONE FDA

03:21:24.138 --> 03:21:25.606
APPROVED DRUG FOR WEIGHT LOSS,

03:21:25.673 --> 03:21:28.509
WHILE MAINTAINING UTILIZATION

03:21:28.576 --> 03:21:31.078
CONTROLS. HERE WITH US TODAY TO

03:21:31.145 --> 03:21:33.047
CONFIRM AND ANSWER ANY POTENTIAL

03:21:33.114 --> 03:21:36.317
TECHNICAL QUESTIONS, I HAVE

03:21:36.384 --> 03:21:38.519
DOCTOR WAYNE HÌ, AN INTERNIST IN

03:21:38.586 --> 03:21:40.588
LOS ANGELES. HE'S AN EXPERT IN

03:21:40.655 --> 03:21:43.057
TREATING DIABETES, HYPERTENSION

03:21:43.124 --> 03:21:45.092
AND OBESITY. SORRY, OVER HERE ON

03:21:45.159 --> 03:21:47.895
THIS SIDE. AND THEN I HAVE

03:21:47.962 --> 03:21:50.498
KRISTINE BELL, AND SHE IS WITH

03:21:50.565 --> 03:21:52.900
THE AMERICAN DIABETES

03:21:52.967 --> 03:21:55.069
ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU. YOU'LL

03:21:55.136 --> 03:21:57.638
EACH HAVE TWO MINUTES. GOOD

03:21:57.705 --> 03:21:58.706
AFTERNOON. MEMBERS OF THE

03:21:58.773 --> 03:21:59.674
COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS DOCTOR

03:21:59.740 --> 03:22:01.242
WAYNE HÌ, PRIMARY CARE

03:22:01.309 --> 03:22:03.044
PHYSICIAN, OBESITY SPECIALIST

03:22:03.110 --> 03:22:04.745
AND DIABETES AND OBESITY

03:22:04.812 --> 03:22:06.280
RESEARCHER HERE ON BEHALF OF THE

03:22:06.347 --> 03:22:08.216
ALLIANCE FOR PATIENT ACCESS. I

03:22:08.282 --> 03:22:10.685
URGE YOU TO SUPPORT SB 535 AND

03:22:10.751 --> 03:22:12.720
HAVE THREE POINTS FOR YOUR

03:22:12.787 --> 03:22:15.189
CONSIDERATION ONE. OBESITY IS A

03:22:15.256 --> 03:22:16.724
COMPLEX CHRONIC DISEASE AND

03:22:16.791 --> 03:22:18.860
NEEDS TO BE COVERED LIKE ONE.

03:22:18.926 --> 03:22:19.894
SOME PEOPLE STILL THINK OBESITY

03:22:19.961 --> 03:22:22.196
IS A DISEASE OF POOR CHOICES AND

03:22:22.263 --> 03:22:24.632
POOR WILLPOWER. WE USED TO THINK

03:22:24.699 --> 03:22:25.933
THE SAME THING OF DEPRESSION,

03:22:26.000 --> 03:22:27.635
BUT NOW WE KNOW THAT'S WRONG.

03:22:27.702 --> 03:22:29.604
THERE ARE PHYSIOLOGICAL CAUSES

03:22:29.670 --> 03:22:32.173
OF THESE DISEASES INFLUENCED BY

03:22:32.240 --> 03:22:33.541
INDIVIDUAL GENETICS AND

03:22:33.608 --> 03:22:35.409
PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS. THE

03:22:35.476 --> 03:22:36.811
CHRONIC AND COMPLEX NATURE OF

03:22:36.878 --> 03:22:38.346
OBESITY MAY REQUIRE MULTIPLE

03:22:38.412 --> 03:22:39.981
TREATMENT MODALITIES, AND

03:22:40.047 --> 03:22:41.549
HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS NEED ACCESS

03:22:41.616 --> 03:22:43.351
TO ALL FORMS OF EFFECTIVE

03:22:43.417 --> 03:22:44.752
TREATMENT, INCLUDING INTENSIVE

03:22:44.819 --> 03:22:46.621
BEHAVIORAL THERAPY, BARIATRIC

03:22:46.687 --> 03:22:48.656
SURGERY, AND ANTI-OBESITY

03:22:48.723 --> 03:22:49.957
MEDICATIONS, WHICH I'LL REFER TO

03:22:50.024 --> 03:22:53.427
AS TWO. WE NEED TO INVEST IN

03:22:53.494 --> 03:22:55.096
PREVENTATIVE CARE. ONE STUDY

03:22:55.162 --> 03:22:56.964
SHOWED A 20% DECREASE IN

03:22:57.031 --> 03:22:59.100
STROKES, HEART ATTACKS, AND ALL

03:22:59.166 --> 03:23:01.302
CAUSE MORTALITY IN PEOPLE WITH

03:23:01.369 --> 03:23:02.737
OBESITY WITH CARDIOVASCULAR

03:23:02.803 --> 03:23:04.539
DISEASE. AFTER TAKING A SPECIFIC

03:23:04.605 --> 03:23:06.874
AOM FOR A LITTLE OVER FOUR

03:23:06.941 --> 03:23:08.509
YEARS, WITH THE POSITIVE EFFECTS

03:23:08.576 --> 03:23:11.078
SEEN EARLY ON, TREATMENT OF

03:23:11.145 --> 03:23:12.046
OBESITY CAN ALSO DECREASE THE

03:23:12.113 --> 03:23:14.982
RISK OF 13 TYPES OF CANCERS AND

03:23:15.049 --> 03:23:17.084
IMPROVE CERTAIN AUTOIMMUNE

03:23:17.151 --> 03:23:18.653
CONDITIONS LIKE PSORIASIS,

03:23:18.719 --> 03:23:21.188
LUPUS, AND MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS.

03:23:21.255 --> 03:23:22.823
PROPER TREATMENT OF OBESITY IS

03:23:22.890 --> 03:23:24.625
ONE OF THE BEST EXAMPLES OF

03:23:24.692 --> 03:23:27.128
PREVENTATIVE CARE. AND LASTLY,

03:23:27.194 --> 03:23:28.696
THIS INVESTMENT IN OBESITY

03:23:28.763 --> 03:23:30.932
TREATMENT WILL NOT COST AS MUCH

03:23:30.998 --> 03:23:33.701
AS PROJECTED AOM COSTS WILL

03:23:33.768 --> 03:23:35.136
DECREASE MORE RAPIDLY THAN

03:23:35.202 --> 03:23:37.772
CURRENT PROJECTIONS SUGGEST. FOR

03:23:37.838 --> 03:23:39.073
EXAMPLE, TWO HIGHLY EFFECTIVE

03:23:39.140 --> 03:23:41.609
AND ORAL OPTIONS ARE ANTICIPATED

03:23:41.676 --> 03:23:43.444
TO BE FDA APPROVED WITHIN THE

03:23:43.511 --> 03:23:45.980
NEXT 6 TO 12 MONTHS. AS A

03:23:46.047 --> 03:23:47.782
CLINICAL RESEARCHER IN THE FIELD

03:23:47.848 --> 03:23:49.250
WHO HAS WORKED WITH THESE DRUGS,

03:23:49.317 --> 03:23:50.685
I HAVE SEEN THAT THESE PILLS MAY

03:23:50.751 --> 03:23:52.753
BE JUST AS EFFECTIVE AS SOME OF

03:23:52.820 --> 03:23:54.188
THE CURRENT EXPENSIVE INJECTABLE

03:23:54.255 --> 03:23:56.457
MEDICATIONS FOR OBESITY. THERE

03:23:56.524 --> 03:23:59.093
ARE ALSO CURRENTLY 120 NEW DRUGS

03:23:59.160 --> 03:24:00.661
IN DEVELOPMENT FOR OBESITY,

03:24:00.728 --> 03:24:03.097
WHICH WILL LEAD TO INTENSE PRICE

03:24:03.164 --> 03:24:05.032
COMPETITION. LET'S STOP FOCUSING

03:24:05.099 --> 03:24:06.867
ON SHORT TERM COSTS AND MORE ON

03:24:06.934 --> 03:24:09.103
THE HIGH RETURN ON INVESTMENT.

03:24:09.170 --> 03:24:11.238
WITH PROPER COVERAGE OF OBESITY

03:24:11.305 --> 03:24:12.974
TREATMENT. PLEASE SUPPORT SB

03:24:13.040 --> 03:24:14.408
535. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

03:24:14.475 --> 03:24:17.278
YOU'LL HAVE TWO MINUTES. GOOD

03:24:17.345 --> 03:24:18.312
AFTERNOON, MADAM CHAIR, AND

03:24:18.379 --> 03:24:19.513
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK

03:24:19.580 --> 03:24:21.649
YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO HEAR

03:24:21.716 --> 03:24:22.883
THIS IMPORTANT PIECE OF

03:24:22.950 --> 03:24:24.251
LEGISLATION TODAY. MY NAME IS

03:24:24.318 --> 03:24:25.586
CHRISTINE FALLIBLE, AND I AM THE

03:24:25.653 --> 03:24:26.887
DIRECTOR OF STATE GOVERNMENT

03:24:26.954 --> 03:24:27.488
AFFAIRS AND ADVOCACY FOR THE

03:24:27.555 --> 03:24:29.423
AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION.

03:24:29.490 --> 03:24:31.993
THE ADA IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN

03:24:32.059 --> 03:24:34.362
COMMITTED TO IMPROVING THE LIVES

03:24:34.428 --> 03:24:35.162
OF PEOPLE WITH DIABETES. TURNING

03:24:35.229 --> 03:24:37.465
THE TIDE TO TREAT OBESITY,

03:24:37.531 --> 03:24:38.766
PREVENT TYPE TWO DIABETES, AND

03:24:38.833 --> 03:24:40.701
ULTIMATELY FINDING CURATIVE

03:24:40.768 --> 03:24:41.936
OPTIONS FOR ALL PEOPLE AFFECTED

03:24:42.003 --> 03:24:44.405
BY DIABETES. BUT WE ARE FACING A

03:24:44.472 --> 03:24:46.040
CRISIS. THE RISING TIDE OF

03:24:46.107 --> 03:24:47.775
OBESITY IS AN EPIDEMIC IN THE

03:24:47.842 --> 03:24:48.909
UNITED STATES. RATES OF

03:24:48.976 --> 03:24:50.344
OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY ARE

03:24:50.411 --> 03:24:52.513
RISING IN NEARLY ALL 50 STATES,

03:24:52.580 --> 03:24:54.582
INCLUDING CALIFORNIA. CURRENTLY,

03:24:54.649 --> 03:24:56.250
NEARLY A THIRD OF CALIFORNIA

03:24:56.317 --> 03:24:58.285
ADULTS HAVE OBESITY. THAT'S OVER

03:24:58.352 --> 03:25:01.288
11 MILLION PEOPLE. BETWEEN 85

03:25:01.355 --> 03:25:02.890
AND 90% OF PEOPLE WHO DEVELOP

03:25:02.957 --> 03:25:03.924
TYPE TWO DIABETES ARE OVERWEIGHT

03:25:03.991 --> 03:25:06.193
OR OBESE. IN ADDITION TO

03:25:06.260 --> 03:25:07.695
DIABETES, EXCESS BODY WEIGHT IS

03:25:07.762 --> 03:25:09.263
ONE OF THE MAIN DRIVERS OF

03:25:09.330 --> 03:25:10.865
DISEASE AND EARLY MORTALITY,

03:25:10.931 --> 03:25:12.733
PUTTING PEOPLE AT HIGHER RISK

03:25:12.800 --> 03:25:13.734
FOR CANCER, HEART DISEASE,

03:25:13.801 --> 03:25:15.936
STROKE, AND PREMATURE DEATH.

03:25:16.003 --> 03:25:17.972
OBESITY IS COSTLY AND COMPLEX,

03:25:18.039 --> 03:25:19.540
AND WE SHOULD TREAT IT AS THE

03:25:19.607 --> 03:25:21.208
CHRONIC DISEASE THAT IT IS.

03:25:21.275 --> 03:25:22.410
THERE ARE EVIDENCE BASED

03:25:22.476 --> 03:25:23.544
TREATMENTS THAT CAN TREAT

03:25:23.611 --> 03:25:24.879
OBESITY AND HELP PREVENT THE

03:25:24.945 --> 03:25:26.814
ONSET OF TYPE TWO DIABETES,

03:25:26.881 --> 03:25:27.848
INCLUDING THE DIABETES

03:25:27.915 --> 03:25:30.418
PREVENTION PROGRAM, FDA APPROVED

03:25:30.484 --> 03:25:31.752
MEDICATIONS AND BARIATRIC

03:25:31.819 --> 03:25:33.721
SURGERY. PEOPLE NEED EVIDENCE

03:25:33.788 --> 03:25:35.423
BASED INTERVENTIONS TO TREAT AND

03:25:35.489 --> 03:25:37.358
MANAGE THEIR CONDITION LIKE ANY

03:25:37.425 --> 03:25:38.893
OTHER. THE HEALTH BENEFITS AND

03:25:38.959 --> 03:25:40.761
COST SAVINGS OF EFFECTIVE WEIGHT

03:25:40.828 --> 03:25:42.263
MANAGEMENT THROUGH DIET AND

03:25:42.329 --> 03:25:43.898
EXERCISE, WITH MEDICAID, WITH

03:25:43.964 --> 03:25:46.333
MEDICATION USAGE OR SURGERY HAVE

03:25:46.400 --> 03:25:47.601
BEEN EXTENSIVELY AND

03:25:47.668 --> 03:25:49.403
CONSISTENTLY DOCUMENTED.

03:25:49.470 --> 03:25:50.771
TREATING OBESITY EARLY CAN

03:25:50.838 --> 03:25:52.473
PREVENT DEBILITATING AND COSTLY

03:25:52.540 --> 03:25:54.175
HEALTH COMPLICATIONS, INCLUDING

03:25:54.241 --> 03:25:55.776
THE DEVELOPMENT OF PREDIABETES

03:25:55.843 --> 03:25:57.712

ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS, WE

03:27:31.605 --> 03:27:34.341
DO HAVE AN OPPOSED POSITION ON

03:27:34.408 --> 03:27:35.576
THE BILL. I FIRST WANT TO

03:27:35.643 --> 03:27:36.677
RECOGNIZE THE AUTHOR. WE'VE HAD

03:27:36.744 --> 03:27:38.746
A LOT OF REALLY GOOD

03:27:38.813 --> 03:27:39.847
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS BILL.

03:27:39.914 --> 03:27:42.283
SHE'S HAD AN OPEN DOOR POLICY,

03:27:42.349 --> 03:27:43.517
AND I KNOW THAT SHE'S VERY

03:27:43.584 --> 03:27:45.119
COMMITTED TO THIS ISSUE. SO, YOU

03:27:45.186 --> 03:27:46.620
KNOW, I WANT TO COMMEND HER AND

03:27:46.687 --> 03:27:48.589
THANK HER FOR THE LEVEL OF

03:27:48.656 --> 03:27:49.857
DISCUSSION THAT WE'VE HAD ABOUT

03:27:49.924 --> 03:27:50.858
THIS. BUT, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE

03:27:50.925 --> 03:27:52.526
BEEN OPPOSED TO THIS BILL

03:27:52.593 --> 03:27:53.761
THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. AND THE

03:27:53.828 --> 03:27:55.830
REASON FOR THAT IS, YOU KNOW,

03:27:55.896 --> 03:27:57.431
DESPITE THE WAY IT'S DRAFTED, WE

03:27:57.498 --> 03:27:58.699
DO BELIEVE THAT IT DOES OPEN THE

03:27:58.766 --> 03:28:01.202
DOOR FOR COVERAGE OF EXPENSIVE

03:28:01.268 --> 03:28:04.438
GLP1 RELATED DRUGS FOR WEIGHT

03:28:04.505 --> 03:28:06.040
LOSS. AND THOSE DRUGS, WHILE

03:28:06.106 --> 03:28:07.541
THEY'RE EFFECTIVE, THEY'RE NOT

03:28:07.608 --> 03:28:09.510
VERY COST EFFECTIVE. AND INDEED,

03:28:09.577 --> 03:28:10.911
YOU KNOW, THE RECENT STATE

03:28:10.978 --> 03:28:12.346
BUDGET, YOU KNOW, ELIMINATED

03:28:12.413 --> 03:28:13.547
COVERAGE FOR THESE DRUGS FOR

03:28:13.614 --> 03:28:15.616
WEIGHT LOSS IN THE MEDI-CAL

03:28:15.683 --> 03:28:16.684
PROGRAM IN RECOGNITION OF THE

03:28:16.750 --> 03:28:18.853
PRETTY OVERWHELMING FINANCIAL

03:28:18.919 --> 03:28:21.755
BURDEN RELATED TO COVERING THESE

03:28:21.822 --> 03:28:23.591
DRUGS. AND SO AND WE ALSO DO

03:28:23.657 --> 03:28:24.658
WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS,

03:28:24.725 --> 03:28:26.193
THIS, THIS COMMITTEE, YOU KNOW,

03:28:26.260 --> 03:28:28.329
DID NOT MOVE FORWARD WITH A BILL

03:28:28.395 --> 03:28:30.264
THAT WAS, ALBEIT DRAFTED

03:28:30.331 --> 03:28:31.398
DIFFERENTLY AND MORE

03:28:31.465 --> 03:28:32.800
EXPANSIVELY. BUT IT WAS IN

03:28:32.867 --> 03:28:35.035
RECOGNITION TO THAT THAT FISCAL

03:28:35.102 --> 03:28:36.904
PRESSURE THAT THESE DRUGS ARE

03:28:36.971 --> 03:28:40.007
CAUSING. BUT EXTENSIVE

03:28:40.074 --> 03:28:41.175
AMENDMENTS ARE GOING INTO THE

03:28:41.242 --> 03:28:42.710
BILL. WE WILL TAKE TIME TO

03:28:42.776 --> 03:28:45.779
REVIEW THEM. AND IF THAT DOES

03:28:45.846 --> 03:28:47.114
RESULT IN A POSITION CHANGE ON

03:28:47.181 --> 03:28:49.049
OUR PART, WE WILL NOTIFY THE

03:28:49.116 --> 03:28:51.352
AUTHOR AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE

03:28:51.418 --> 03:28:53.320
OR, YOU KNOW, REENGAGE IN

03:28:53.387 --> 03:28:54.622
DISCUSSION ABOUT ANY FINE TUNING

03:28:54.688 --> 03:28:56.590
THAT NEEDS TO OCCUR ON THAT

03:28:56.657 --> 03:28:58.192
LANGUAGE. BUT WE DO APPRECIATE,

03:28:58.259 --> 03:28:59.860
YOU KNOW, THE WORK OF THE

03:28:59.927 --> 03:29:00.494
COMMITTEE, THE AUTHOR AND

03:29:00.561 --> 03:29:03.597
EVERYONE INVOLVED. BUT WE DO

03:29:03.664 --> 03:29:05.799
REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL IN

03:29:05.866 --> 03:29:07.368
PRINT. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. ARE

03:29:07.434 --> 03:29:09.603
THERE ANY OTHERS IN THE HEARING

03:29:09.670 --> 03:29:12.072
ROOM IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL?

03:29:12.139 --> 03:29:14.341
PLEASE COME FORWARD, MOVED BY

03:29:14.408 --> 03:29:19.079
AGUIAR-CURRY. SECONDED BY CRELL.

03:29:19.146 --> 03:29:20.080
SEEING NO OTHERS IN THE HEARING

03:29:20.147 --> 03:29:21.482
ROOM WHO OPPOSE THE BILL, I'LL

03:29:21.548 --> 03:29:23.050
BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE

03:29:23.117 --> 03:29:24.351
FOR QUESTIONS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

03:29:24.418 --> 03:29:27.922
PATTERSON THANK YOU. I JUST WANT

03:29:27.988 --> 03:29:30.257
TO SAY I THINK WE'VE TALKED A

03:29:30.324 --> 03:29:31.625
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS BILL, BUT

03:29:31.692 --> 03:29:33.394
I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS BILL. I

03:29:33.460 --> 03:29:36.630
LIKE THIS BILL A LOT. I DON'T

03:29:36.697 --> 03:29:38.766
REALLY THIS IS A STATEMENT

03:29:38.832 --> 03:29:39.600
THAT'S MADE. I DON'T AGREE WITH

03:29:39.667 --> 03:29:41.502
EXACTLY HOW IT'S PHRASED, BUT

03:29:41.568 --> 03:29:43.370
OBESITY IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF

03:29:43.437 --> 03:29:45.172
PREVENTABLE DEATH OF AMERICANS.

03:29:45.239 --> 03:29:47.708
NOW, I DON'T I THINK THE WORD

03:29:47.775 --> 03:29:50.711
PREVENTABLE IS VERY BROAD IN

03:29:50.778 --> 03:29:53.814
THIS DESCRIPTION, BECAUSE I

03:29:53.881 --> 03:29:55.983
THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS.

03:29:56.050 --> 03:29:57.518
I MEAN, YOU CAN GO TO THE GYM

03:29:57.584 --> 03:29:59.620
ALL YOU WANT, YOU CAN EAT ALL

03:29:59.687 --> 03:30:01.455
THE RIGHT FOODS YOU WANT, BUT

03:30:01.522 --> 03:30:01.989
SOME PEOPLE, FOR WHATEVER

03:30:02.056 --> 03:30:03.991
REASON, MAYBE IT'S WHAT'S IN OUR

03:30:04.058 --> 03:30:05.726
FOOD SUPPLY. MAYBE IT'S A

03:30:05.793 --> 03:30:06.493
METABOLIC DISEASE THAT THEY HAVE

03:30:06.560 --> 03:30:07.895
OTHER THINGS GOING ON

03:30:07.962 --> 03:30:10.030
INTERNALLY. THEY NEED

03:30:10.097 --> 03:30:12.666
ASSISTANCE. SOMETIMES THAT'S

03:30:12.733 --> 03:30:15.402
MEDICATION ASSISTANCE. AND THE

03:30:15.469 --> 03:30:17.805
COST OF OBESITY IN THIS COUNTRY

03:30:17.871 --> 03:30:22.276
IS UNQUANTIFIABLE TO OUR HEALTH

03:30:22.343 --> 03:30:24.478
SYSTEM. SO I APPRECIATE PUSHING

03:30:24.545 --> 03:30:27.314
THE ENVELOPE ON THIS. AND I DO

03:30:27.381 --> 03:30:29.950
SEE THAT IT WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE

03:30:30.017 --> 03:30:32.353
BUDGET FOR MEDI-CAL. AND I

03:30:32.419 --> 03:30:33.554
THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS

03:30:33.620 --> 03:30:34.955
UNFORTUNATE AS WELL. I THINK

03:30:35.022 --> 03:30:37.157
THAT SHOULD HAVE STAYED IN THERE

03:30:37.224 --> 03:30:39.760
AT THAT TIME. SO ANYWAYS, JUST

03:30:39.827 --> 03:30:40.894
LOOKING, I JUST WANTED A LONG

03:30:40.961 --> 03:30:42.563
WAY TO SAY I'M LOOKING FORWARD

03:30:42.629 --> 03:30:44.732
TO SUPPORTING THIS BILL, AND

03:30:44.798 --> 03:30:46.433
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT. THANK

03:30:46.500 --> 03:30:52.973
YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ADAMS.

03:30:53.040 --> 03:30:53.974
THANK YOU SO MUCH, SENATOR. JUST

03:30:54.041 --> 03:30:56.176
A QUICK CLARIFICATION. IT WASN'T

03:30:56.243 --> 03:30:57.511
COMPLETELY TAKEN OUT OF

03:30:57.578 --> 03:30:59.747
MEDI-CAL. THERE ARE OBESITY

03:30:59.813 --> 03:31:01.448
DRUGS THAT ARE STILL THAT ARE

03:31:01.515 --> 03:31:04.852
STILL IN THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET.

03:31:04.918 --> 03:31:06.854
BUT SENATOR, THANK YOU FOR THIS

03:31:06.920 --> 03:31:08.255
BILL. I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY

03:31:08.322 --> 03:31:10.224
IMPORTANT. AND I'LL BE I'M HAPPY

03:31:10.290 --> 03:31:13.093
TO MOVE OR SECOND OR SUPPORT

03:31:13.160 --> 03:31:16.296
WHEN WE DO THE VOTE. THANK YOU.

03:31:16.363 --> 03:31:17.631
THANK YOU, SENATOR, FOR BRINGING

03:31:17.698 --> 03:31:19.533
THIS FORWARD. I KNOW THAT WE'VE

03:31:19.600 --> 03:31:20.868
BEEN ABLE TO TALK ABOUT THIS

03:31:20.934 --> 03:31:23.437
QUITE A BIT, AND I THINK IT'S A

03:31:23.504 --> 03:31:26.040
VERY THOUGHTFUL ADJUSTMENT TO

03:31:26.106 --> 03:31:29.643
OUR EXISTING HEALTH PLAN

03:31:29.710 --> 03:31:30.878
COVERAGE AND ALLOWS FOR US TO BE

03:31:30.944 --> 03:31:33.514
ABLE TO INCLUDE HEALTH PLAN

03:31:33.580 --> 03:31:36.150
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE FOR

03:31:36.216 --> 03:31:37.885
ANTI-OBESITY MEDICATION FOR A

03:31:37.951 --> 03:31:40.087
BROADER GROUP, WHICH I VERY MUCH

03:31:40.154 --> 03:31:41.488
APPRECIATE. AND WITH THAT, WOULD

03:31:41.555 --> 03:31:44.224
YOU LIKE TO CLOSE? YES, JUST A

03:31:44.291 --> 03:31:46.927
FEW COMMENTS. NUMBER ONE TO

03:31:46.994 --> 03:31:48.762
POINT OUT, AND MY STAFF IS

03:31:48.829 --> 03:31:50.197
PROBABLY GOING TO KICK ME, BUT

03:31:50.264 --> 03:31:51.732
I'M MAYBE I PRONOUNCE IT WRONG,

03:31:51.799 --> 03:31:53.500
BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

03:31:53.567 --> 03:31:55.903
THE CHERUB OR THERE'S ANOTHER

03:31:55.969 --> 03:31:57.738
WAY OF SAYING THANK YOU. I KNEW

03:31:57.805 --> 03:31:58.839
YOU ALL WOULD KNOW YOU'RE ON

03:31:58.906 --> 03:32:02.009
THIS COMMITTEE. ACTUALLY, WE

03:32:02.076 --> 03:32:04.511
RECEIVED A VERY GOOD REPORT ON

03:32:04.578 --> 03:32:06.713
THAT. AND I THINK IT SPEAKS TO

03:32:06.780 --> 03:32:08.982
THE FACT THAT WHAT I SAID IN MY

03:32:09.049 --> 03:32:11.218
ORIGINAL COMMENTS, THIS IS NOT A

03:32:11.285 --> 03:32:12.553
NEW PRODUCT. THIS IS SOMETHING

03:32:12.619 --> 03:32:14.621
NOW, WE'VE HAD DATA MORE THAN

03:32:14.688 --> 03:32:16.824
TWO YEARS OF DATA TO SHOW THAT

03:32:16.890 --> 03:32:19.026
PEOPLE WHO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

03:32:19.093 --> 03:32:21.161
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE

03:32:21.228 --> 03:32:22.563
MEDICATION CAN, IN FACT, SEE

03:32:22.629 --> 03:32:25.032
POSITIVE RESULTS, WHICH IN TURN

03:32:25.099 --> 03:32:27.000
SHOULD REDUCE THE COSTS OF

03:32:27.067 --> 03:32:28.502
ADDITIONAL HEALTH CARE COSTS.

03:32:28.569 --> 03:32:29.837
THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO

03:32:29.903 --> 03:32:32.739
POINT OUT THAT I THINK IS REALLY

03:32:32.806 --> 03:32:33.874
IMPORTANT. I WOULD HAVE MUCH

03:32:33.941 --> 03:32:35.576
RATHER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BRING

03:32:35.642 --> 03:32:37.077
FORWARD A BILL THAT SAID

03:32:37.144 --> 03:32:38.245
INSURANCE COMPANIES HEALTH PLANS

03:32:38.312 --> 03:32:40.848
SHOULD HAVE TO PROVIDE THIS TO

03:32:40.914 --> 03:32:42.549
ANYONE WHO NEEDS IT, INCLUDING

03:32:42.616 --> 03:32:47.121
DECLARED OBESE AT 0.30. THAT'S

03:32:47.187 --> 03:32:48.522
REALLY HOW I FEEL. BUT WE'RE NOT

03:32:48.589 --> 03:32:51.024
AT THAT POINT OF BEING ABLE TO

03:32:51.091 --> 03:32:52.426
ACHIEVE THAT. SO WE WERE REALLY

03:32:52.493 --> 03:32:54.495
WORKING VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND

03:32:54.561 --> 03:32:56.697
THE HEALTH PLANS SITUATION AND

03:32:56.763 --> 03:32:59.233
TO SAY THAT THAT WHEN IT IS

03:32:59.299 --> 03:33:01.201
DEEMED TO BE APPROPRIATE AND TO

03:33:01.268 --> 03:33:03.003
BE NEEDED, AT LEAST PEOPLE

03:33:03.070 --> 03:33:04.705
SHOULD HAVE THE CHOICE OF THESE

03:33:04.771 --> 03:33:06.406
FOLLOWING THINGS. SO I THANK YOU

03:33:06.473 --> 03:33:08.275
FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. I THANK YOU

03:33:08.342 --> 03:33:10.377
FOR GIVING PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY

03:33:10.444 --> 03:33:11.812
TO LIVE BETTER. AND I WOULD JUST

03:33:11.879 --> 03:33:14.114
LEAVE YOU WITH ONE EXAMPLE.

03:33:14.181 --> 03:33:16.683
IMAGINE BEING TOLD YOU CAN'T

03:33:16.750 --> 03:33:18.819
HAVE GLASSES NOW FOR ME, I'VE

03:33:18.886 --> 03:33:20.621
BEEN WEARING GLASSES SINCE I WAS

03:33:20.687 --> 03:33:23.490
EIGHT YEARS OLD. IF I CAN'T WEAR

03:33:23.557 --> 03:33:26.093
GLASSES, I CAN'T SEE AS

03:33:26.160 --> 03:33:27.361
EFFECTIVELY. I CAN'T DO MY JOB

03:33:27.427 --> 03:33:30.230
AS EFFECTIVELY. I MAY TRIP AND

03:33:30.297 --> 03:33:31.832
FALL. THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT

03:33:31.899 --> 03:33:34.501
COULD OCCUR BECAUSE I CANNOT SEE

03:33:34.568 --> 03:33:37.070
AS WELL WITHOUT GLASSES. A

03:33:37.137 --> 03:33:38.505
PERSON WHO DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS

03:33:38.572 --> 03:33:40.774
TO HEALTH CARE MAY BE ABLE TO

03:33:40.841 --> 03:33:42.910
LIVE. WHO KNOWS HOW LONG THEY'LL

03:33:42.976 --> 03:33:44.011
BE ABLE TO LIVE, BUT THEY WON'T

03:33:44.077 --> 03:33:45.913
BE ABLE TO DO IT AS WELL. THANK

03:33:45.979 --> 03:33:48.348

03:33:48.415 --> 03:33:49.683

COVER MATERNITY HEALTH CARE

03:35:17.571 --> 03:35:18.672
SERVICES, BUT THEY'VE

03:35:18.739 --> 03:35:20.307
INCREASINGLY BEEN SKIRTING THAT

COLLECT PREMIUMS AND

03:35:28.749 --> 03:35:29.583

AND PASS ON THE FINANCIAL BURDEN

03:35:31.318 --> 03:35:34.154
ONTO INTENDED PARENTS. SB 257

03:35:34.221 --> 03:35:36.523
WOULD AFFIRM THAT HEALTH CARE

03:35:36.590 --> 03:35:37.858

SURROGATES HAVE ACCESS TO

03:35:44.264 --> 03:35:45.332
QUALITY HEALTH CARE, AND THAT

BUSY PARENTS OF TWIN TODDLERS,

SURROGATE BASED IN CALIFORNIA.

03:36:40.387 --> 03:36:42.022
I'M HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT

03:36:42.089 --> 03:36:44.925
OF SB 257 SO THAT FAMILIES LIKE

03:36:44.991 --> 03:36:47.094
OURS DON'T FACE THE SAME

03:36:47.160 --> 03:36:49.029
DISCRIMINATION THAT WE DID. WE

03:36:49.096 --> 03:36:50.864
SPENT YEARS DREAMING OF STARTING

03:36:50.931 --> 03:36:53.400
A FAMILY AS A SAME SEX COUPLE.

03:36:53.467 --> 03:36:55.068
WE NEEDED ASSISTED REPRODUCTION

03:36:55.135 --> 03:36:58.205
THROUGH SURROGACY. IT WAS A LONG

03:36:58.271 --> 03:37:00.207
EMOTIONAL PROCESS, MATCHING WITH

03:37:00.273 --> 03:37:03.610
A SURROGATE, GOING THROUGH IVF,

03:37:03.677 --> 03:37:05.879
SECURING SPECIAL INSURANCE, ALL

03:37:05.946 --> 03:37:08.348
TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE WOULD BE

03:37:08.415 --> 03:37:10.884
PROTECTED. THE PROCESS WAS

03:37:10.951 --> 03:37:13.420
REMARKABLE. THE STING OF

03:37:13.487 --> 03:37:14.488
DISCRIMINATION BEGAN WHEN IT

03:37:14.554 --> 03:37:17.124
CAME TIME TO GIVE BIRTH. FIRST,

03:37:17.190 --> 03:37:18.725
WE WERE TOLD WE COULDN'T BE

03:37:18.792 --> 03:37:20.494
PRESENT FOR OUR CHILDREN'S BIRTH

03:37:20.560 --> 03:37:22.396
BECAUSE KAISER DIDN'T CONSIDER

03:37:22.462 --> 03:37:24.931
US THE PARENTS. AFTER PLEADING

03:37:24.998 --> 03:37:27.801
WITH THE MEDICAL TEAM, THEY LET

03:37:27.868 --> 03:37:30.303
US IN MOMENTS BEFORE DELIVERY.

03:37:30.370 --> 03:37:32.806
IT WAS HUMILIATING AND

03:37:32.873 --> 03:37:34.975
STRESSFUL. FROM THERE, THINGS

03:37:35.041 --> 03:37:37.878
ONLY GOT WORSE. STARTING THE

03:37:37.944 --> 03:37:38.945
NEXT MORNING WHILE CARING FOR

03:37:39.012 --> 03:37:41.081
OUR NEWBORNS, THE HOSPITAL'S

03:37:41.148 --> 03:37:43.283
BILLING DEPARTMENT CALLED US

03:37:43.350 --> 03:37:45.051
NINE TIMES, DEMANDING PAYMENT

03:37:45.118 --> 03:37:46.853
EVEN THOUGH EVERYTHING WAS

03:37:46.920 --> 03:37:49.489
COVERED BY INSURANCE. THEY SAID

03:37:49.556 --> 03:37:51.892
THIS ONLY HAPPENS IN THESE TYPES

03:37:51.958 --> 03:37:54.728
OF SITUATIONS, MEANING

03:37:54.795 --> 03:37:57.931
SURROGACY. WITH SURROGACY,

03:37:57.998 --> 03:37:59.299
INSURERS IN CALIFORNIA CAN

03:37:59.366 --> 03:38:01.134
DEMAND A REIMBURSEMENT FROM

03:38:01.201 --> 03:38:02.903
PAYMENTS MADE TO SURROGATES,

03:38:02.969 --> 03:38:05.005
EVEN THOUGH ALL THE PREMIUMS AND

03:38:05.071 --> 03:38:07.974
DEDUCTIBLES ARE PAID JUST

03:38:08.041 --> 03:38:10.477
BECAUSE SHE'S A SURROGATE. THIS

03:38:10.544 --> 03:38:12.345
DOESN'T HAPPEN WITH ANY OTHER

03:38:12.412 --> 03:38:16.216
KIND OF PREGNANCY. NEVADA HAS

03:38:16.283 --> 03:38:18.151
ALREADY OUTLAWED THIS FORM OF

03:38:18.218 --> 03:38:19.052
DISCRIMINATION, AND WE SHOULD

03:38:19.119 --> 03:38:21.455
FOLLOW THE SAME STEPS. I URGE

03:38:21.521 --> 03:38:24.524
YOU TO SUPPORT SB 257 SO THAT

03:38:24.591 --> 03:38:27.027
ALL CALIFORNIA FAMILIES,

03:38:27.093 --> 03:38:28.862
INCLUDING THOSE FORMED THROUGH

03:38:28.929 --> 03:38:30.997
SURROGACY, ARE TREATED WITH THE

03:38:31.064 --> 03:38:34.134
DIGNITY AND FAIRNESS THEY

03:38:34.201 --> 03:38:40.340
DESERVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU,

03:38:40.407 --> 03:38:41.575
CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS, FOR

03:38:41.641 --> 03:38:43.577
THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. I'M

SARAH PAGE, CEO OF ART RISK

FINANCIAL AND INSURANCE

03:38:46.546 --> 03:38:47.881
SOLUTIONS, AN INSURANCE AGENCY

03:38:47.948 --> 03:38:49.749
BASED IN SANTA CLARITA,

03:38:49.816 --> 03:38:50.851
CALIFORNIA. I'VE HAD THE

03:38:50.917 --> 03:38:52.319
PRIVILEGE TO HELP OVER 20,000

03:38:52.385 --> 03:38:54.421
FAMILIES THROUGH SURROGACY. I'M

03:38:54.488 --> 03:38:56.823
HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB 257, WHICH

03:38:56.890 --> 03:38:59.826
CLOSES A LOOPHOLE IN THE HEALTH

03:38:59.893 --> 03:39:00.393
INSURANCE MARKET, ONE THAT

03:39:00.460 --> 03:39:02.329
ALLOWS DISCRIMINATION AGAINST

03:39:02.395 --> 03:39:03.530
THOSE WHO TURN TO SURROGACY TO

03:39:03.597 --> 03:39:04.998
BUILD THEIR FAMILIES AND THOSE

03:39:05.065 --> 03:39:06.766
WHO ARE NEWLY PREGNANT. HERE'S

03:39:06.833 --> 03:39:08.668
THE ISSUE WHEN A SURROGATE

03:39:08.735 --> 03:39:10.937
BECOMES PREGNANT, 87% OF

03:39:11.004 --> 03:39:11.872
CALIFORNIA HEALTH INSURERS

03:39:11.938 --> 03:39:14.508
DEMAND REIMBURSEMENT FOR HER

03:39:14.574 --> 03:39:15.709
COMPENSATION AND THREATEN TO

03:39:15.775 --> 03:39:17.544
SEIZE IT TO COVER MEDICAL

03:39:17.611 --> 03:39:18.845
EXPENSES. EVEN THOUGH POLICY WAS

03:39:18.912 --> 03:39:20.614
PURCHASED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE

03:39:20.680 --> 03:39:22.849
PREGNANCY AND ALL PREMIUMS AND

03:39:22.916 --> 03:39:24.551
DEDUCTIBLES WERE PAID. IN MOST

03:39:24.618 --> 03:39:26.152
CASES, THE INTENDED PARENTS WHO

03:39:26.219 --> 03:39:27.621
ALREADY FACE SIGNIFICANT COSTS

03:39:27.687 --> 03:39:30.023
ARE FORCED TO PAY THE LIEN. NO

03:39:30.090 --> 03:39:31.858
OTHER PREGNANT PERSON OR FAMILY

03:39:31.925 --> 03:39:33.693
BUILDING AVENUE IS TREATED IN

03:39:33.760 --> 03:39:35.529
THIS MANNER. THIS IS

03:39:35.595 --> 03:39:36.496
DISCRIMINATION BASED SOLELY ON

03:39:36.563 --> 03:39:37.998
HOW AND WHY THE PREGNANCY

03:39:38.064 --> 03:39:41.301
OCCURRED. SB 257 ALSO ASKS FOR

03:39:41.368 --> 03:39:42.702
PREGNANCY TO BE A QUALIFYING

03:39:42.769 --> 03:39:44.471
LIFE EVENT FOR ENROLLMENT IN

03:39:44.538 --> 03:39:45.705
INSURANCE. PREGNANCY IS ONE OF

03:39:45.772 --> 03:39:48.208
THE MOST MEDICALLY SIGNIFICANT

03:39:48.275 --> 03:39:49.042
AND VULNERABLE EXPERIENCES A

03:39:49.109 --> 03:39:51.611
PERSON CAN FACE. WHILE THE ACA

03:39:51.678 --> 03:39:53.146
EXPANDED COVERAGE OPTIONS FOR

03:39:53.213 --> 03:39:54.714
MANY INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES,

03:39:54.781 --> 03:39:56.483
SOME PREGNANT PEOPLE CONTINUE TO

03:39:56.550 --> 03:39:57.851
ENCOUNTER BARRIERS IN THEIR

03:39:57.918 --> 03:39:59.719
QUEST FOR COVERAGE IN RESPONSE

03:39:59.786 --> 03:40:01.021
TO THE OPPOSITION. WE LIKE TO

03:40:01.087 --> 03:40:03.857
LOOK AT THIS BILL FROM A BROADER

03:40:03.924 --> 03:40:04.658
AND MORE THOUGHTFUL PERSPECTIVE.

03:40:04.724 --> 03:40:07.127
SB 257 PROMOTES MATERNAL AND

03:40:07.193 --> 03:40:08.428
INFANT HEALTH BY ALLOWING

03:40:08.495 --> 03:40:09.963
PREGNANT PERSONS TO OBTAIN

03:40:10.030 --> 03:40:12.098
TIMELY ACCESS TO ADEQUATE HEALTH

03:40:12.165 --> 03:40:13.600
CARE COVERAGE THAT MEETS THEIR

03:40:13.667 --> 03:40:15.402
NEEDS, PREVENTS GAPS IN CARE,

03:40:15.468 --> 03:40:17.537
AND MINIMIZES DOWNSTREAM HEALTH

03:40:17.604 --> 03:40:19.339
CARE COSTS WHILE REINFORCING THE

03:40:19.406 --> 03:40:21.808
STATE'S VALUES OF EQUITY AND

03:40:21.875 --> 03:40:23.577
ACCESS. IN ADDITION, SUGGESTING

03:40:23.643 --> 03:40:25.879
THIS BILL WILL BE ABUSED BY

HERE TODAY IN OPPOSITION TO SB

03:45:24.744 --> 03:45:26.179
257, WHICH WOULD MAKE PREGNANCY

03:45:26.246 --> 03:45:27.914
A QUALIFYING EVENT FOR SPECIAL

03:45:27.981 --> 03:45:29.883
ENROLLMENT FOR HEALTH INSURANCE.

03:45:29.949 --> 03:45:31.184
AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, IN 2014,

03:45:31.251 --> 03:45:32.485
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS

03:45:32.552 --> 03:45:34.320
FULLY IMPLEMENTED IN CALIFORNIA.

03:45:34.387 --> 03:45:35.922
AND ALONG WITH THAT CAME MORE

03:45:35.989 --> 03:45:36.956
MANY IMPORTANT CHANGES IN THE

03:45:37.023 --> 03:45:39.092
HEALTH CARE MARKET, ONE OF WHICH

03:45:39.158 --> 03:45:40.460
WAS THE GUARANTEED ISSUE.

03:45:40.526 --> 03:45:42.028
COVERAGE WAS EXTENDED INTO THE

03:45:42.095 --> 03:45:43.029
INDIVIDUAL MARKET, ALLOWING

03:45:43.096 --> 03:45:44.397
INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES TO HAVE

03:45:44.464 --> 03:45:45.932
FULL ACCESS TO PURCHASE HEALTH

03:45:45.999 --> 03:45:47.300
CARE WITHOUT ANY PREEXISTING

03:45:47.367 --> 03:45:49.402
CONDITION. LIMITATIONS. SINCE

03:45:49.469 --> 03:45:51.004
COVERAGE IS NOW AFFORDED ON A

03:45:51.070 --> 03:45:51.938
GUARANTEED ISSUE BASIS,

03:45:52.005 --> 03:45:53.673
REGARDLESS OF MEDICAL HISTORY,

03:45:53.740 --> 03:45:54.941
THE TRADE OFF TO ENSURE A

03:45:55.008 --> 03:45:57.043
HEALTHY, ROBUST MARKET WAS TO

03:45:57.110 --> 03:45:58.511
IMPLEMENT AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE

03:45:58.578 --> 03:46:00.613
TO HAVE COVERAGE AND LIMIT

03:46:00.680 --> 03:46:01.714
ENROLLMENT TO AN ANNUAL

03:46:01.781 --> 03:46:02.916
ENROLLMENT PERIOD AND SUBSEQUENT

03:46:02.982 --> 03:46:04.250
SPECIAL ENROLLMENT PERIODS THAT

03:46:04.317 --> 03:46:06.085
WERE BASED ON GENERAL LIFE

03:46:06.152 --> 03:46:07.487
EVENTS. THE CONCERN WAS IF

03:46:07.553 --> 03:46:08.922
ENROLLMENT WAS AVAILABLE YEAR

03:46:08.988 --> 03:46:10.723
ROUND WITHOUT LIMITATIONS ON

03:46:10.790 --> 03:46:11.958
COVERAGE, THE INSURANCE MARKET

03:46:12.025 --> 03:46:13.993
WOULD BECOME UNSTABLE. WITH THAT

03:46:14.060 --> 03:46:15.328
BEING SAID, CURRENT SPECIAL

03:46:15.395 --> 03:46:16.429
ENROLLMENT PERIODS ARE LIMITED

03:46:16.496 --> 03:46:17.864
TO WHAT WE CALL QUALIFYING LIFE

03:46:17.931 --> 03:46:19.032
EVENTS. SPECIFICALLY, THESE

03:46:19.098 --> 03:46:20.767
EVENTS INCLUDE WHEN AN

03:46:20.833 --> 03:46:22.168
INDIVIDUAL MOVES, THEY GET

03:46:22.235 --> 03:46:24.404
MARRIED, THEY ADD FAMILY

03:46:24.470 --> 03:46:25.805
MEMBERS, THEY LOSE EMPLOYER

03:46:25.872 --> 03:46:27.173
SPONSORED COVERAGE. THESE TYPES

03:46:27.240 --> 03:46:28.775
OF NARROW EXCEPTIONS TO THE

03:46:28.841 --> 03:46:30.143
ANNUAL ENROLLMENT PERIOD TAKE

03:46:30.209 --> 03:46:31.978
INTO ACCOUNT THE REALITY OF OUR

03:46:32.045 --> 03:46:33.813
LIVES, WHILE ALSO PROTECTING THE

03:46:33.880 --> 03:46:35.214
INTEGRITY OF THE MARKET. THE

03:46:35.281 --> 03:46:36.683
IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE IS THAT

03:46:36.749 --> 03:46:37.951
THE CURRENT SPECIAL ENROLLMENT

03:46:38.017 --> 03:46:39.585
PERIODS ARE GENERIC IN THEIR

03:46:39.652 --> 03:46:41.020
APPLICATION AND EVENLY APPLY TO

03:46:41.087 --> 03:46:42.355
ALL ENROLLEES AND INSUREDS, AND

03:46:42.422 --> 03:46:44.590
ARE NOT TIED TO ONE SPECIFIC

03:46:44.657 --> 03:46:45.959
CONDITION, DISORDER, OR DISEASE,

03:46:46.025 --> 03:46:48.194
WHICH WE THINK IS CRITICAL TO

03:46:48.261 --> 03:46:49.629
CRITICAL DISTINCTION.

03:46:49.696 --> 03:46:50.330
UNFORTUNATELY, WHILE WE

03:46:50.396 --> 03:46:52.131
APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S INTENT

03:46:52.198 --> 03:46:53.166
TO EXPAND HEALTHCARE ACCESS TO

03:46:53.232 --> 03:46:54.801
WOMEN WHEN THEY ARE PREGNANT,

03:46:54.867 --> 03:46:55.735
WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

03:46:55.802 --> 03:46:57.136
OPENING THE DOOR TO CREATING

03:46:57.203 --> 03:46:58.571
CONDITIONS SPECIFIC SPECIAL

03:46:58.638 --> 03:46:59.939
ENROLLMENT PERIODS THAT

03:47:00.006 --> 03:47:01.574
INEVITABLY WILL FAVOR ONE

03:47:01.641 --> 03:47:03.009
CONDITION OVER ANOTHER. AS MANY

03:47:03.076 --> 03:47:04.711
OF YOU KNOW, CRITICAL PIECE TO

03:47:04.777 --> 03:47:05.745
ENSURING THAT CALIFORNIA'S

03:47:05.812 --> 03:47:07.347
HEALTH HAVE ACCESS TO

03:47:07.413 --> 03:47:08.348
AFFORDABLE, QUALITY HEALTH CARE

03:47:08.414 --> 03:47:10.750
IS TO CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE AND

03:47:10.817 --> 03:47:11.951
INCENTIVIZE CONSUMERS TO

03:47:12.018 --> 03:47:12.986
PURCHASE HEALTHCARE EVEN WHEN

03:47:13.052 --> 03:47:14.787
THEY DON'T NEED IT, SO THAT

03:47:14.854 --> 03:47:15.788
CALIFORNIA'S HEALTHCARE MARKET

03:47:15.855 --> 03:47:18.091
REMAINS AFFORDABLE FOR EVERYONE.

03:47:18.157 --> 03:47:19.158
UNFORTUNATELY, AS DRAFTED, WE

03:47:19.225 --> 03:47:22.362
BELIEVE SB FIVE 7257 UNDERMINES

03:47:22.428 --> 03:47:23.730
THAT GOAL BY ALLOWING PEOPLE TO

03:47:23.796 --> 03:47:26.332
GO WITHOUT COVERAGE UNTIL THEY

03:47:26.399 --> 03:47:27.400
NEED IT. LASTLY, I WOULD JUST

03:47:27.467 --> 03:47:29.569
NOTE THAT THE ANALYSIS POINTED

03:47:29.635 --> 03:47:32.772
TO A $69 MILLION INCREASE AND

03:47:32.839 --> 03:47:34.574
POTENTIALLY RESULTING IN $2 PER

03:47:34.640 --> 03:47:36.109
MEMBER PER MONTH IMPACT ON THE

03:47:36.175 --> 03:47:37.543
INDIVIDUAL LEVEL PLANS. FOR

03:47:37.610 --> 03:47:39.078
THESE REASONS, WE ARE OPPOSED TO

03:47:39.145 --> 03:47:40.847
THE BILL IN PRINT, BUT REMAIN

03:47:40.913 --> 03:47:41.614
COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE

03:47:41.681 --> 03:47:43.649
AUTHOR AND SPONSORS IF THE BILL

03:47:43.716 --> 03:47:46.652
MOVES FORWARD TODAY. THANK YOU,

03:47:50.423 --> 03:47:51.624
VALUES. SURROGACY IS THE ACTION

03:47:51.691 --> 03:47:53.626
OF A WOMAN CARRYING A CHILD FOR

03:47:53.693 --> 03:47:54.594
ANOTHER WOMAN WHO EITHER CAN'T

03:47:54.660 --> 03:47:56.396
OR REFUSES TO CARRY THE BABY

03:47:56.462 --> 03:47:57.697
THEMSELVES. WELL, THERE ARE A

03:47:57.764 --> 03:47:59.499
FEW WOMEN WHO DO THIS OUT OF

03:47:59.565 --> 03:48:00.500
LOVE FOR ANOTHER AND THE

03:48:00.566 --> 03:48:02.101
ENJOYMENT OF THE PROCESS. THE

03:48:02.168 --> 03:48:03.403
MAJORITY DO THIS OUT OF THE

03:48:03.469 --> 03:48:04.404
FINANCIAL NECESSITY, RUNNING OUT

03:48:04.470 --> 03:48:05.505
ONE'S MOST SACRED INTERNALS FOR

03:48:05.571 --> 03:48:07.740
A BUCK WHEN IT WAS MEANT FOR HER

03:48:07.807 --> 03:48:09.542
TO BRING FORTH LIFE IN A LOVING

03:48:09.609 --> 03:48:10.810
SITUATION THAT WOULD CREATE A

03:48:10.877 --> 03:48:11.878
FAMILY FOR THE WOMAN AND THE MAN

03:48:11.944 --> 03:48:13.546
SHE CHOOSES TO SHARE THIS

03:48:13.613 --> 03:48:15.181
ENDEAVOR WITH. JUST LIKE WITH

03:48:15.248 --> 03:48:16.182
PROSTITUTION, MANY WOMEN FIND

03:48:16.249 --> 03:48:17.250
THEMSELVES IN A SITUATION WHERE

03:48:17.316 --> 03:48:18.618
THEY MAY BE DESPERATE TO OR NOT

03:48:18.684 --> 03:48:20.586
HAVE ANY OTHER WAYS TO PROCURE

03:48:20.653 --> 03:48:21.888
THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY SO FAST.

03:48:21.954 --> 03:48:22.955
WHILE MANY WOMEN RIGHTFULLY WILL

03:48:23.022 --> 03:48:23.956
SCOLD MEN FOR PURCHASING ANOTHER

03:48:24.023 --> 03:48:25.525
FOR SEXUAL GRATIFICATION, THEY

03:48:25.591 --> 03:48:27.026
FIND IT PERFECTLY FINE TO RENT

03:48:27.093 --> 03:48:28.828
OUT A WOMAN TO CARRY A BABY FOR

03:48:28.895 --> 03:48:30.696
THEM. BUT REALLY, WHAT'S THE

03:48:30.763 --> 03:48:31.297
DIFFERENCE WITH PROSTITUTION?

03:48:31.364 --> 03:48:32.932
WOMEN RISK MURDER, GREAT BODILY

03:48:32.999 --> 03:48:34.834
HARM EITHER THROUGH ASSAULT OR

03:48:34.901 --> 03:48:36.869
STIS, OR POSSIBLY UNWANTED

03:48:36.936 --> 03:48:37.603
PREGNANCIES. SURROGATES HAVE A

03:48:37.670 --> 03:48:40.039
HIGHER RATE OF POSTPARTUM

03:48:40.106 --> 03:48:41.174
HEMORRHAGING, GESTATIONAL

03:48:41.240 --> 03:48:43.009
DIABETES, HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE

03:48:43.076 --> 03:48:44.444
INFECTIONS, EMOTIONAL AND

03:48:44.510 --> 03:48:45.545
PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA, INCLUDING

03:48:45.611 --> 03:48:47.380
ATTACHMENTS TO THE CHILD, AND

03:48:47.447 --> 03:48:48.748
POTENTIAL DIFFICULTIES WITH

03:48:48.815 --> 03:48:50.216
SURRENDERING THE BABY.

03:48:50.283 --> 03:48:51.384
PREECLAMPSIA THAT CAN LEAD TO

03:48:51.451 --> 03:48:52.718
CIRCULATORY HEALTH PROBLEMS LONG

03:48:52.785 --> 03:48:53.953
AFTER THE PREGNANCY IS OVER,

03:48:54.020 --> 03:48:55.988
LEADING TO AN EARLY DEATH OF THE

03:48:56.055 --> 03:48:56.756
WOMAN, LEAVING THESE SURROGATES

03:48:56.823 --> 03:48:58.424
WITH THE AFTERMATH AND THE BILLS

03:48:58.491 --> 03:49:00.059
TO TRY TO HEAL THEMSELVES. IT

03:49:00.126 --> 03:49:00.960
YOU IGNORE THESE FACTS, YOU

03:49:01.027 --> 03:49:02.762
CARRY ON WITH THIS LIKE IT'S

03:49:02.829 --> 03:49:03.629
ACCEPTABLE TO WANTING TO TWEAK

03:49:03.696 --> 03:49:05.131
THE INSURANCE LAWS SO THAT

03:49:05.198 --> 03:49:06.265
COLLECTIVELY, ALL WHO PURCHASE

03:49:06.332 --> 03:49:07.767
INSURANCE HAVE TO PAY FOR THESE

03:49:07.834 --> 03:49:09.068
CRIMES AGAINST WOMEN. SURROGACY

03:49:09.135 --> 03:49:10.736
IS NOT MEDICALLY NECESSARY

03:49:10.803 --> 03:49:12.538
SERVICE. IT IS CHOSEN PRIVATE

03:49:12.605 --> 03:49:13.973
PRIVATE ARRANGEMENT, AND FORCING

03:49:14.040 --> 03:49:15.141
INSURANCE COMPANIES TO COVER

03:49:15.208 --> 03:49:16.509
THEM WILL LEAD TO HIGHER

03:49:16.576 --> 03:49:17.643
PREMIUMS, REDUCED PLANS,

03:49:17.710 --> 03:49:18.578
FLEXIBILITY, AND INCREASED

03:49:18.644 --> 03:49:20.113
OUT-OF-POCKET COSTS FOR EVERYDAY

03:49:20.179 --> 03:49:21.614
FAMILIES. THIS WILL ALSO CREATE

03:49:21.681 --> 03:49:23.349
MORE INCENTIVES TO PREY UPON

03:49:23.416 --> 03:49:24.750
ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED WOMEN

03:49:24.817 --> 03:49:26.819
TO USE THEIR WOMBS AS COMMON AS

03:49:26.886 --> 03:49:28.387
COMMODITY. THIS REDUCES

03:49:28.454 --> 03:49:30.490
MOTHERHOOD AND PREGNANCY TO A

03:49:30.556 --> 03:49:32.358
TRANSACTION. SB TWO 57TH MAY

03:49:32.425 --> 03:49:33.626
BENEFIT A FEW, BUT IT DOES SO AT

03:49:33.693 --> 03:49:35.962
THE EXPENSE OF THE MANY. I URGE

03:49:36.028 --> 03:49:37.930
YOU TO CONSIDER THE LONG TERM

03:49:37.997 --> 03:49:39.499
COST TO FAMILIES AND VOTE NO TO

03:49:39.565 --> 03:49:41.267
THIS HANDMAID'S TALE BILL. THANK

03:49:41.334 --> 03:49:45.972
YOU. MOVE THE BILL. MOVED BY

03:49:46.038 --> 03:49:52.445
ADDIS, SECONDED BY THE. THE

GONZALEZ, RODRIGUEZ AND

03:49:55.982 --> 03:50:02.221
GONZALEZ. ARE THERE ANY OTHERS

03:50:02.288 --> 03:50:03.656
IN OPPOSITION? PLEASE COME

03:50:03.723 --> 03:50:07.126

03:50:07.193 --> 03:50:08.694
OLGA SHILOH WITH THE CALIFORNIA

03:50:08.761 --> 03:50:10.129
ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS. I'D

03:50:10.196 --> 03:50:10.863
LIKE TO ALIGN MY REMARKS WITH

03:50:10.930 --> 03:50:13.032
THOSE OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM

03:50:13.099 --> 03:50:14.333
O'CLOCK, AND WE RESPECTFULLY

03:50:14.400 --> 03:50:14.901
OPPOSE THE BILL. THANK YOU,

03:50:14.967 --> 03:50:18.337
THANK YOU. ON BEHALF OF

03:50:18.404 --> 03:50:19.805
CALIFORNIA FAMILY COUNCIL AND

03:50:19.872 --> 03:50:21.541
RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION. THANK

03:50:21.607 --> 03:50:24.010
YOU. SEEING NO OTHER OPPOSITION

03:50:24.076 --> 03:50:24.877
IN THE HEARING ROOM, WE WILL

03:50:24.944 --> 03:50:27.480
BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE

03:50:27.547 --> 03:50:30.650
FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.

03:50:30.716 --> 03:50:32.385
MR. PATTERSON, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

03:50:32.451 --> 03:50:34.854
PATTERSON, THANK YOU. I HAVE A

03:50:34.921 --> 03:50:39.825
QUESTION. SO RIGHT NOW, WHEN

03:50:39.892 --> 03:50:42.828
THERE'S A QUALIFYING LIFE EVENT,

03:50:42.895 --> 03:50:46.032
SUCH AS CHANGING A JOB OR

03:50:46.098 --> 03:50:48.968
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, DOES THE

03:50:49.035 --> 03:50:54.040
INSURANCE. DOES THE INSURANCE OF

03:50:54.106 --> 03:50:55.107
WHEREVER THEY, THE PERSON GETS

03:50:55.174 --> 03:50:57.243
THE INSURANCE FROM HAVE TO COVER

03:50:57.310 --> 03:50:59.812
ALL OF THE DEPENDENTS WHEN

03:50:59.879 --> 03:51:03.216
THERE'S A CURRENTLY A QUALIFYING

03:51:03.282 --> 03:51:09.455
EVENT? SO IF YOU LOSE YOUR JOB

03:51:09.522 --> 03:51:11.958
AND YOUR AND THEREFORE YOUR

03:51:12.024 --> 03:51:13.826
DEPENDENTS ARE ALSO UNDER THAT

03:51:13.893 --> 03:51:14.627
INSURANCE, I BELIEVE THAT

03:51:14.694 --> 03:51:16.128
CREATES A QUALIFYING EVENT FOR

03:51:16.195 --> 03:51:18.164
YOU TO MOVE INTO THE EXCHANGE OR

03:51:18.231 --> 03:51:19.498
TO PRIVATE INSURANCE FOR THOSE

03:51:19.565 --> 03:51:20.800
WHO'VE LOST COVERAGE BECAUSE

03:51:20.866 --> 03:51:22.868
YOU'VE LIKE IF YOU IF YOU WERE

03:51:22.935 --> 03:51:24.203
THE PRIMARY INDIVIDUAL AND YOU

03:51:24.270 --> 03:51:26.105
HAD NO OTHER DEPENDENTS, IT

03:51:26.172 --> 03:51:28.341
WOULDN'T OPEN IT UP FOR NEW

03:51:28.407 --> 03:51:28.975
DEPENDENTS. BUT IF YOU'VE LOST

03:51:29.041 --> 03:51:31.244
IT FOR YOURSELF ALONG WITH YOUR

03:51:31.310 --> 03:51:32.578
DEPENDENTS BASED ON YOUR

03:51:32.645 --> 03:51:34.380
EMPLOYMENT OR YOU'VE MOVED.

03:51:34.447 --> 03:51:36.482
ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS OFTENTIMES IF

03:51:36.549 --> 03:51:38.351
YOU IF YOU RELOCATE TO

03:51:38.417 --> 03:51:39.619
CALIFORNIA, IF YOU RELOCATE IN

03:51:39.685 --> 03:51:41.954
THE STATE, YOU OFTEN WILL NEED

03:51:42.021 --> 03:51:43.289
TO CHANGE INSURANCE COMPANIES

03:51:43.356 --> 03:51:45.224
BASED ON YOUR NEW LOCATION. SO

03:51:45.291 --> 03:51:46.692
THOSE ARE ALL QUALIFYING EVENTS

03:51:46.759 --> 03:51:47.893
THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR YOU, AS

03:51:47.960 --> 03:51:49.629
WELL AS YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS THAT

03:51:49.695 --> 03:51:51.597
WERE UNDER THAT POLICY, CORRECT?

03:51:51.664 --> 03:51:53.399
YEAH. SO IF I GET, YOU KNOW,

03:51:53.466 --> 03:51:54.767
LET'S SAY WHEN I GOT MARRIED,

03:51:54.834 --> 03:51:58.170
YOU KNOW, WHETHER IT WAS ME OR

03:51:58.237 --> 03:52:00.373
MY WIFE HAD INSURANCE, SHE COULD

03:52:00.439 --> 03:52:02.375
ADD YOU. YES. OR YOU COULD ADD

03:52:02.441 --> 03:52:07.847
HER COULD AT THAT TIME. THE ONLY

03:52:07.913 --> 03:52:10.349
THIS BILL SEEMS THE ONE CONCERN

03:52:10.416 --> 03:52:11.784
I THE THING THAT I SEE WITH IT,

03:52:11.851 --> 03:52:14.153
IT SEEMS TO MANDATE THAT THIS

03:52:14.220 --> 03:52:15.454
WOULD BE A QUALIFYING EVENT FOR

03:52:15.521 --> 03:52:17.256
ALL DEPENDENTS. SO IF THE

03:52:17.323 --> 03:52:19.358
INDIVIDUAL AT THAT TIME HAS

03:52:19.425 --> 03:52:21.527
INSURANCE THAT ONLY COVERS

03:52:21.594 --> 03:52:22.962
THEMSELVES. AND NOW WE'VE

03:52:23.029 --> 03:52:26.632
CREATED A, A QUALIFYING EVENT

03:52:26.699 --> 03:52:29.101
WHERE ALL OF THE DEPENDENTS CAN

03:52:29.168 --> 03:52:32.305
NOW BECOME A PART OF THAT

03:52:32.371 --> 03:52:36.676
INSURANCE. SO I BELIEVE IT'S AN

03:52:36.742 --> 03:52:38.077
OPPORTUNITY. SO FOR EXAMPLE,

03:52:38.144 --> 03:52:40.613
YOUR EXAMPLE OF MARRIAGE, THE

03:52:40.680 --> 03:52:42.081
INDIVIDUAL CAN CHOOSE THE BEST

03:52:42.148 --> 03:52:43.082
INSURANCE FOR THAT PARTICULAR

03:52:43.149 --> 03:52:45.885
COUPLE. SOMETIMES IT'S LET'S SAY

03:52:45.951 --> 03:52:49.288
JUST IT'S PARTNER A WHO WOULD

03:52:49.355 --> 03:52:50.656
LIKE, YOU KNOW, TO HAVE THAT

03:52:50.723 --> 03:52:51.924
INSURANCE BE THEIR INSURANCE

03:52:51.991 --> 03:52:53.259
BASED ON THEIR JOB. IT'S A

03:52:53.326 --> 03:52:54.560
BETTER INSURANCE. IT COVERS

03:52:54.627 --> 03:52:56.429
MORE. THE DEDUCTIBLES ARE LOWER.

03:52:56.495 --> 03:52:58.030
IT'S BASICALLY A DECISION THAT

03:52:58.097 --> 03:52:59.732
THEY CAN MAKE. OR IT CAN BE

03:52:59.799 --> 03:53:02.234
PERSON B WHO HAS, LET'S SAY, YOU

03:53:02.301 --> 03:53:03.969
KNOW, EXTRA FEATURES IN THEIR

03:53:04.036 --> 03:53:05.104
INSURANCE BASED ON THEIR

03:53:05.171 --> 03:53:06.906
EMPLOYER OR EVEN SUPPLEMENTAL

03:53:06.972 --> 03:53:07.973
FEATURES THAT THEY HAVE

03:53:08.040 --> 03:53:09.442
PURCHASED ON IN THE PRIVATE

03:53:09.508 --> 03:53:11.544
MARKET. SO IT'S REALLY JUST A

03:53:11.610 --> 03:53:13.079
CHOICE. AND I DO WANT TO

03:53:13.145 --> 03:53:14.747
HIGHLIGHT THIS, THAT THE FACT

03:53:14.814 --> 03:53:18.250
THAT MOVING IS A QUALIFYING LIFE

03:53:18.317 --> 03:53:19.251
EVENT THAT PEOPLE DO ALMOST

03:53:19.318 --> 03:53:21.620
EVERY SINGLE YEAR, AND

03:53:21.687 --> 03:53:22.988
PREGNANCY, THAT LITERALLY

03:53:23.055 --> 03:53:25.391
CHANGES A PERSON'S ENTIRE LIFE,

03:53:25.458 --> 03:53:27.059
IS NOT CONSIDERED A QUALIFYING

03:53:27.126 --> 03:53:30.663
LIFE EVENT IS VERY DISAPPOINTING

03:53:30.730 --> 03:53:36.035
IN CALIFORNIA'S LAWS. YES, UNDER

03:53:36.102 --> 03:53:38.971
UNDERSTOOD, THE INTENT OF WHAT

03:53:39.038 --> 03:53:40.740
YOU'RE TRYING TO GET TO THOUGH

03:53:40.806 --> 03:53:42.908
IS, IS GET INSURANCE FOR THE

03:53:42.975 --> 03:53:45.411
PERSON WHO IS THE SURROGATE

03:53:45.478 --> 03:53:46.812
MOTHER, FOR EXAMPLE. RIGHT.

03:53:46.879 --> 03:53:48.881
THAT'S THAT'S THE INTENT OF YOUR

03:53:48.948 --> 03:53:51.817
BILL. CORRECT. THE INTENT OF THE

03:53:51.884 --> 03:53:54.487
BILL IS THERE'S A NUMBER OF

03:53:54.553 --> 03:53:56.522
THINGS, AND I'M GOING TO LET MY

03:53:56.589 --> 03:53:58.691
WITNESS SPEAK TO IT A LITTLE BIT

03:53:58.758 --> 03:53:59.925
MORE. THERE ARE TWO INTENTS. ONE

03:53:59.992 --> 03:54:02.695
IS, OF COURSE, TO GET RID OF THE

03:54:02.762 --> 03:54:03.362
REIMBURSEMENTS FROM THE

03:54:03.429 --> 03:54:04.563
INSURANCE COMPANIES. THE OTHER

03:54:04.630 --> 03:54:05.831
IS PREGNANCY AS A QUALIFYING

03:54:05.898 --> 03:54:07.400
LIFE EVENT, WHICH IS NOT

03:54:07.466 --> 03:54:09.535
SPECIFIC TO SURROGATES. IT IS

03:54:09.602 --> 03:54:11.337
FOR A MARKET OF PEOPLE THAT,

03:54:11.404 --> 03:54:12.471
UNFORTUNATELY, ARE KIND OF

03:54:12.538 --> 03:54:14.073
MISSED IN THE HEALTH HEALTH

03:54:14.140 --> 03:54:16.342
INSURANCE MARKETPLACE FROM THOSE

03:54:16.409 --> 03:54:17.676
THAT EITHER ARE NOT OR CANNOT

03:54:17.743 --> 03:54:20.045
GET MEDI-CAL, ARE NOT ON PLANS

03:54:20.112 --> 03:54:21.714
THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR

03:54:21.781 --> 03:54:23.282
SUBSIDIZED PLANS, OR ARE PEOPLE

03:54:23.349 --> 03:54:24.383
WHO, UNFORTUNATELY DON'T FALL

03:54:24.450 --> 03:54:25.718
INTO THE CATEGORIES THAT ARE

03:54:25.785 --> 03:54:27.953
HEALTH SAVINGS, AND SO THEREFORE

03:54:28.020 --> 03:54:29.688
THEY CHOOSE NOT TO GET INSURANCE

03:54:29.755 --> 03:54:31.524
BECAUSE A LITTLE EXPENSIVE IN

03:54:31.590 --> 03:54:33.559
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS IS

03:54:33.626 --> 03:54:35.795
JUST LIVING. AND SO ONCE THEY

03:54:35.861 --> 03:54:37.630
THEN BECOME PREGNANT, THAT IS

03:54:37.696 --> 03:54:39.131
SOMETHING AGAIN, A LIFE EVENT

03:54:39.198 --> 03:54:40.566
THAT THEY HAVE NOW HOPEFULLY

03:54:40.633 --> 03:54:42.701
WILL HAVE AN OPTION TO CHOOSE TO

03:54:42.768 --> 03:54:44.770
HAVE THAT HEALTH INSURANCE AGAIN

03:54:44.837 --> 03:54:49.475
FOR THE FAMILY. OKAY. AND SO

03:54:49.542 --> 03:54:52.211
RIGHT NOW, UNDER CURRENT LAW, IF

03:54:52.278 --> 03:54:54.713
A SURROGATE MOTHER DELIVERS A

03:54:54.780 --> 03:54:58.617
CHILD, HER INSURANCE MAY NOT

03:54:58.684 --> 03:55:03.389
COVER THAT OR OR SORRY LEADING

03:55:03.456 --> 03:55:05.925
UP TO THAT MIGHT NOT COVER THE

03:55:05.991 --> 03:55:09.829
SERVICES OF THE PREGNANCY. SO

03:55:09.895 --> 03:55:11.230
CURRENTLY, THERE'S NOT AN

03:55:11.297 --> 03:55:13.532
EXCLUSION WITHIN POLICIES THAT

03:55:13.599 --> 03:55:16.702
ARE GOVERNED BY THE DMHC. WHAT

03:55:16.769 --> 03:55:18.871
WE'RE SEEING IS A RIGHT TO

03:55:18.938 --> 03:55:20.372
REIMBURSEMENT WHERE THEY'RE

03:55:20.439 --> 03:55:22.508
ASKING FOR MEDICAL EXPENSES TO

03:55:22.575 --> 03:55:23.843
BE REIMBURSED BACK TO THE

03:55:23.909 --> 03:55:27.213
INSURANCE COMPANY AND FOR HER

03:55:27.279 --> 03:55:28.614
SURROGACY. NOW, I WILL SAY THAT

03:55:28.681 --> 03:55:29.748
IT ESSENTIALLY CREATES AN

03:55:29.815 --> 03:55:31.817
ILLUSORY BENEFIT BECAUSE OF THE

03:55:31.884 --> 03:55:33.953
AMOUNT THAT THEY'RE SEEKING TO

03:55:34.019 --> 03:55:35.654
GRAB BACK IS FAR MORE THAN THE

03:55:35.721 --> 03:55:37.523
AMOUNT OF THE COMPENSATION. SO

03:55:37.590 --> 03:55:38.958
ESSENTIALLY, THEY'RE NOT GETTING

03:55:39.024 --> 03:55:42.595
THE BENEFIT OF THOSE COVERED

03:55:42.661 --> 03:55:43.829
SERVICES BECAUSE THEY ARE ENDING

03:55:43.896 --> 03:55:45.798
UP HAVING TO PAY BACK THE

03:55:45.865 --> 03:55:47.333
BENEFITS THAT THEY RECEIVED

03:55:47.399 --> 03:55:48.334
UNDERNEATH THE INSURANCE

03:55:48.400 --> 03:55:51.237
COMPANY. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. WELL,

03:55:51.303 --> 03:55:54.106
JUST A COMMENT. I THINK, YOU

03:55:54.173 --> 03:55:55.608
KNOW, I PERSONALLY WISH THE

03:55:55.674 --> 03:55:57.676
TESTIMONY WOULD HAVE FOCUSED ON

03:55:57.743 --> 03:55:59.512
JUST PREGNANCY BEING A

03:55:59.578 --> 03:56:01.580
QUALIFYING EVENT RATHER THAN THE

03:56:01.647 --> 03:56:04.183
SURROGACY. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE.

03:56:04.250 --> 03:56:06.785
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN BLESSED TO

03:56:06.852 --> 03:56:09.555
HAVE A FIVE PREGNANCIES IN, IN,

03:56:09.622 --> 03:56:12.858
YOU KNOW, MY PERSONAL SITUATION.

03:56:12.925 --> 03:56:15.861
AND I CAN SEE IN HOW THAT COULD

03:56:15.928 --> 03:56:18.664
BE A I HAVEN'T BEEN PREGNANT. AS

03:56:18.731 --> 03:56:20.432
A SIDE NOTE, JUST IF THERE WAS

03:56:20.499 --> 03:56:21.634
ANY CONFUSION ABOUT THAT, I GOT

03:56:21.700 --> 03:56:25.170
SOME THINGS UP HERE. BUT PEANUT

03:56:25.237 --> 03:56:27.640
GALLERY OVER HERE. BUT BUT YEAH,

03:56:27.706 --> 03:56:29.141
YOU KNOW, SO I UNDERSTAND HOW

03:56:29.208 --> 03:56:31.577
YOU KNOW THAT THAT IS IMPORTANT.

03:56:31.644 --> 03:56:33.412
THAT THAT IS DOES SEEM LIKE

03:56:33.479 --> 03:56:34.880
QUALIFYING EVENT. A LOT OF

03:56:34.947 --> 03:56:35.848
THINGS CHANGE, WHETHER IT'S

03:56:35.915 --> 03:56:37.750
FIRST KID OR FIFTH KID OR

03:56:37.816 --> 03:56:41.220
WHATEVER. BUT, YOU KNOW,

03:56:41.287 --> 03:56:42.821
SURROGACY AND I HAVE SOME

03:56:42.888 --> 03:56:44.189
FRIENDS THAT HAVE BEEN SURROGATE

03:56:44.256 --> 03:56:46.258
MOTHERS AND TRYING TO GIVE A

03:56:46.325 --> 03:56:47.826
FAMILY, YOU KNOW, A CHILD THAT

03:56:47.893 --> 03:56:51.063
THEY WANTED. AND SO I GENERALLY,

03:56:51.130 --> 03:56:52.097
YOU KNOW, I UNDERSTAND, YOU

03:56:52.164 --> 03:56:53.832
KNOW, THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF

03:56:53.899 --> 03:56:55.734
CONTROVERSY AROUND THAT IN, IN

03:56:55.801 --> 03:56:58.270
SOME CIRCLES. BUT BUT I THINK

03:56:58.337 --> 03:57:01.373
THE INTENT OF THE BILL, WHICH IS

03:57:01.440 --> 03:57:03.676
WHEN, WHEN A MOTHER GETS

03:57:03.742 --> 03:57:05.010
PREGNANT, THAT THAT BECOMES A

03:57:05.077 --> 03:57:06.512
QUALIFYING EVENT. AND I THINK IF

03:57:06.579 --> 03:57:08.113
THE TESTIMONY WOULD HAVE STARTED

03:57:08.180 --> 03:57:09.982
THERE, I WOULD HAVE FELT MUCH

03:57:10.049 --> 03:57:12.017
MORE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT WITH

03:57:12.084 --> 03:57:14.053
THE BILL. BUT I UNDERSTAND THE

03:57:14.119 --> 03:57:15.154
INTENT. AND SO I'M GLAD YOU

03:57:15.220 --> 03:57:17.957
CLARIFIED THAT PRIOR TO THE VOTE

03:57:18.023 --> 03:57:24.797
BEING TAKEN. THANK YOU.

03:57:24.863 --> 03:57:25.698
ASSEMBLYMEMBER GONZALEZ, JUST A

03:57:25.764 --> 03:57:27.266
COMMENT. I JUST WANTED TO THANK

03:57:27.333 --> 03:57:28.867
EVERYBODY HERE WHO CAME AND

03:57:28.934 --> 03:57:29.969
TESTIFIED, AND THANK YOU FOR

03:57:30.035 --> 03:57:31.570
SHARING YOUR STORY. NONE OF US

03:57:31.637 --> 03:57:33.505
WOULD BE HERE IF IT WAS NOT FOR

03:57:33.572 --> 03:57:35.774
A WOMAN. SO I WANT TO BE VERY

03:57:35.841 --> 03:57:36.375
CLEAR ABOUT THAT, ESPECIALLY

03:57:36.442 --> 03:57:38.911
WITH THE TESTIMONY THAT WE

03:57:38.978 --> 03:57:40.079
HEARD. SO I JUST WANT TO THANK

03:57:40.145 --> 03:57:40.913
ALL THE FOLKS WHO'VE COME OUT

03:57:40.980 --> 03:57:42.014
HERE TO TESTIFY, AND I

03:57:42.081 --> 03:57:46.785
APPRECIATE YOU. THANK YOU.

03:57:46.852 --> 03:57:49.421
ASSEMBLYMEMBER ADDISON. I THINK

03:57:49.488 --> 03:57:51.156
WE MOVED THE BILL. HAPPY TO

03:57:51.223 --> 03:57:52.591
SUPPORT. THANK THE AUTHOR.

03:57:52.658 --> 03:57:53.559
APPRECIATE YOU COMING AND

03:57:53.626 --> 03:57:55.861
SHARING YOUR STORIES. WE HAVE

03:57:55.928 --> 03:57:57.296
FRIENDS WHO'VE GONE THROUGH

03:57:57.363 --> 03:57:58.697
SURROGACY ON BOTH SIDES, EITHER

03:57:58.764 --> 03:58:01.634
SURROGATE OR THE BENEFIT OF A

03:58:01.700 --> 03:58:03.435
SURROGATE, AND THE JOY THAT IT

03:58:03.502 --> 03:58:04.503
BRINGS TO PEOPLE'S LIVES TO BE

03:58:04.570 --> 03:58:05.938
ABLE TO RAISE CHILDREN IN A

03:58:06.005 --> 03:58:08.707
LOVING FAMILY IS SOMETHING ALL

03:58:08.774 --> 03:58:10.709
OF US DESERVE. IF WE WANT TO BE

03:58:10.776 --> 03:58:12.845
ABLE TO HAVE THAT. AND SO JUST

03:58:12.911 --> 03:58:15.447
WANT TO THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE

03:58:15.514 --> 03:58:17.049
TIME AND THANK THE AUTHOR ON

03:58:17.116 --> 03:58:19.852
THIS. SENATOR, JUST TO CLARIFY,

03:58:19.918 --> 03:58:21.553
ARE YOU ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS

03:58:21.620 --> 03:58:23.622
OFFERED BY A COMMITTEE? YES.

03:58:23.689 --> 03:58:27.126
THANK YOU. THIS IS ACTUALLY I'VE

03:58:27.192 --> 03:58:28.927
HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF HAVING

03:58:28.994 --> 03:58:30.062
THREE PREGNANCIES OR ACTUALLY

03:58:30.129 --> 03:58:33.265
MORE, BUT THREE DELIVERIES. AND

03:58:33.332 --> 03:58:35.100
IN ALL OF THOSE INSTANCES, I HAD

03:58:35.167 --> 03:58:37.169
THE PRIVILEGE OF KNOWING THAT I

03:58:37.236 --> 03:58:40.372
HAD HEALTH CARE PROVIDED TO ME

03:58:40.439 --> 03:58:44.109
BECAUSE I THOSE CHILDREN WERE TO

03:58:44.176 --> 03:58:47.980
BE MINE. AND I THIS IS I REALLY

03:58:48.047 --> 03:58:50.416
LEARNED IN THIS BILL THAT THAT

03:58:50.482 --> 03:58:52.751
WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE WE'RE

03:58:52.818 --> 03:58:55.254
CAUSING PEOPLE TO HAVE TO HAVE

03:58:55.320 --> 03:58:58.123
LIENS ASSOCIATED WITH, WITH

03:58:58.190 --> 03:59:00.225
THEIR HEALTH CARE PROVISION WHEN

03:59:00.292 --> 03:59:03.529
THEY ARE GIVING BIRTH TO A

03:59:03.595 --> 03:59:06.031
CHILD. THAT IS A PART OF

03:59:06.098 --> 03:59:07.933
SURROGACY. AND I DON'T THINK

03:59:08.000 --> 03:59:10.736
THAT. THAT'S RIGHT. SO I WANT TO

03:59:10.803 --> 03:59:12.504
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING FORWARD

03:59:12.571 --> 03:59:14.306
THIS BILL, AS WELL AS

03:59:14.373 --> 03:59:15.407
RECOGNIZING THAT PREGNANCY IS A

03:59:15.474 --> 03:59:17.943
QUALIFYING EVENT. OUR LIVES ARE

03:59:18.010 --> 03:59:21.146
FOREVER CHANGED WHEN WE GET

03:59:21.213 --> 03:59:23.649
PREGNANT. AND WITH THAT, I WOULD

03:59:23.716 --> 03:59:26.618
ASK YOU TO JUST CONTINUE TO WORK

03:59:26.685 --> 03:59:29.455
ON THIS BILL AND ASK THAT YOU

03:59:29.521 --> 03:59:32.124
CLOSE. THANK YOU. FIRST AND

03:59:32.191 --> 03:59:33.158
FOREMOST, I JUST WANT TO THANK

03:59:33.225 --> 03:59:34.927
ALL THE WITNESSES AND METOOS IN

03:59:34.993 --> 03:59:37.663
SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. YOU KNOW,

03:59:37.730 --> 03:59:38.864
SURROGACY IN GENERAL. I THINK

03:59:38.931 --> 03:59:40.733
THAT WE ALL READ ABOUT IT AND

03:59:40.799 --> 03:59:43.235
SEE IT AND SO FORTH, BUT IT'S

03:59:43.302 --> 03:59:44.336
NOT NECESSARILY SOMETHING THAT

03:59:44.403 --> 03:59:46.739
WE'RE ALL VERY EXPERIENCED WITH.

03:59:46.805 --> 03:59:48.974
AND I HAD PLENTY OF QUESTIONS

03:59:49.041 --> 03:59:51.810
FOR THE ADVOCATES AND MUCH MORE.

03:59:51.877 --> 03:59:53.645
BUT WHAT WAS SHOCKING TO ME WAS

03:59:53.712 --> 03:59:55.347
THE FACT THAT PREGNANCY WAS NOT

03:59:55.414 --> 03:59:57.149
INCLUDED AS A QUALIFYING LIFE

03:59:57.216 --> 03:59:59.351
EVENT, WHEN SO MANY OTHER THINGS

03:59:59.418 --> 04:00:01.887
IN OUR HEALTH INSURANCE BUSINESS

04:00:01.954 --> 04:00:04.056
AND INDUSTRY ARE CONSIDERED

04:00:04.123 --> 04:00:06.158
QUALIFYING. I WILL ALSO SAY THAT

04:00:06.225 --> 04:00:07.693
WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

04:00:07.760 --> 04:00:09.428
INSURANCE COVERAGE AND THE

04:00:09.495 --> 04:00:10.496
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE INSURANCE

04:00:10.562 --> 04:00:12.698
AND MUCH MORE, IT IS VERY

04:00:12.765 --> 04:00:15.267
SKEWED. IT IS DEEPLY, DEEPLY

04:00:15.334 --> 04:00:18.070
SKEWED AND IT IS NOT FAIR AND A

04:00:18.137 --> 04:00:19.538
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS. AND I

04:00:19.605 --> 04:00:21.039
THINK THAT EVEN WITH THE COST

04:00:21.106 --> 04:00:22.341
THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS

04:00:22.407 --> 04:00:23.575
PARTICULAR BILL, I THINK IT'S

04:00:23.642 --> 04:00:26.311
THE RIGHT THING TO DO WHEN WE'RE

04:00:26.378 --> 04:00:26.845
TALKING ABOUT JUSTICE FOR

04:00:26.912 --> 04:00:28.614
FAMILIES. AND AS A FORMER FOSTER

04:00:28.680 --> 04:00:31.350
CARE YOUTH, I WILL JUST SAY THAT

04:00:31.416 --> 04:00:33.886
NOT EVERYBODY ADOPTS, NOT

04:00:33.952 --> 04:00:35.354
EVERYBODY IS ABLE TO HAVE

04:00:35.420 --> 04:00:38.257
CHILDREN. NOT EVERYBODY IS, YOU

04:00:38.323 --> 04:00:41.093
KNOW, FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE IN

04:00:41.160 --> 04:00:43.996
A LOVING HOME. AND THIS JUST

04:00:44.062 --> 04:00:45.831
PROVIDES THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT

04:00:45.898 --> 04:00:47.766
DO WANT TO CREATE A LOVING HOME

04:00:47.833 --> 04:00:49.468
AND HAVE A FAMILY, AN

04:00:49.535 --> 04:00:50.636
OPPORTUNITY. AND I WANT TO

04:00:50.702 --> 04:00:52.104
SUPPORT THAT IN EVERY WAY

04:00:52.171 --> 04:00:55.007
POSSIBLE. SO WITH THAT, I

04:00:55.073 --> 04:00:55.808
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE

04:00:55.874 --> 04:00:58.811
