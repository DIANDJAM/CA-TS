AUTHORED BACK IN 2023. IT

00:38:16.293 --> 00:38:18.062
CONTAINS CHANGES TO THE LAW THAT

00:38:18.129 --> 00:38:19.897

THE SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY OF

THE STATE LAW. IF WE DO SEE

00:38:40.518 --> 00:38:41.852
LEGISLATION SIGNED INTO LAW AT

00:38:41.919 --> 00:38:42.987
THE FEDERAL LEVEL BEFORE THIS

00:39:45.416 --> 00:39:46.484
TO CONTINUE REFINING AND WORKING

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:49.186

00:39:49.253 --> 00:39:50.254

00:39:50.321 --> 00:39:52.022

TRADITIONAL FINANCE AND

00:39:57.128 --> 00:39:58.863
CRYPTOCURRENCY. AND WE JUST WANT

00:39:58.929 --> 00:39:59.930
TO MAKE SURE WE GET SOME OF

00:39:59.997 --> 00:40:01.966

REMAINDER OF OUR AMENDMENTS ARE

00:40:21.352 --> 00:40:23.287
FOCUSED ON IS MAKING SURE THAT

00:40:23.354 --> 00:40:25.456
JUST BECAUSE THINGS ARE BUILT ON

00:40:25.523 --> 00:40:26.590
THE BLOCKCHAIN DOESN'T MEAN

00:40:26.657 --> 00:40:28.392
THEY'RE FINANCIAL. SO BLOCKCHAIN

00:40:28.459 --> 00:40:29.627
CAN BE LIKE SOFTWARE, AND

00:40:29.693 --> 00:40:31.028
THERE'S LOTS OF STUFF THAT GOES

00:40:31.095 --> 00:40:32.797
ON THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

00:40:32.863 --> 00:40:34.832
CRYPTO. AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD

00:40:34.899 --> 00:40:35.900

FINANCING DISCLOSURE FRAMEWORK.

00:43:00.945 --> 00:43:02.813
RUNNING A SMALL BUSINESS IS HARD

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:04.281
ENOUGH WITHOUT NEEDING TO WADE

00:43:04.348 --> 00:43:05.749
THROUGH THE CONFUSING ARRAY OF

WEIGH IT DOWN ACTUALLY INTO

INFORMATION THEY NEED TO COMPARE

00:43:29.606 --> 00:43:31.542

SUCH AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER

00:44:52.056 --> 00:44:54.058

A MONTH PAYMENT THAT ALMOST

00:45:04.935 --> 00:45:06.770

ALL SMALL BUSINESSES ARE LUCKY

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:07.798
UNANIMOUS IN URGING YOUR SUPPORT

00:46:07.865 --> 00:46:09.700
FOR THIS BILL TO IMPROVE

00:46:09.766 --> 00:46:10.868
TRANSPARENCY. THE NEED FOR THIS

00:46:10.934 --> 00:46:12.469
BILL WAS EXPLAINED BY THE

00:46:12.536 --> 00:46:14.004
FEDERAL RESERVE'S HEAD OF SMALL

00:46:14.071 --> 00:46:15.139
BUSINESS RESEARCH WHEN HE SPOKE

00:46:15.205 --> 00:46:17.207
THIS SPRING AT OUR EVENT AT THE

00:46:17.274 --> 00:46:18.375
ASPEN INSTITUTE. HERE'S WHAT HE

00:46:18.442 --> 00:46:21.245
SAID A 9% SIMPLE INTEREST RATE.

00:46:21.311 --> 00:46:22.813
WHAT'S THE APR FOR THAT? THAT'S

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:25.983
A 45%, HE EXPLAINED. WHAT IS A

00:46:26.049 --> 00:46:27.918
4% FEE RATE MEAN? HE ASKED.

00:46:27.985 --> 00:46:30.654
THAT'S ALSO, IT TURNS OUT, A 45%

00:46:30.721 --> 00:46:32.256
APR. AND HE SAID THAT THE

00:46:32.322 --> 00:46:33.590
FEDERAL RESERVE'S RESEARCH INTO

00:46:33.657 --> 00:46:34.892
SMALL BUSINESS FINANCING

00:46:34.958 --> 00:46:36.393
DISCLOSURES FOUND A COMMON

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:38.128
THREAD OF FRUSTRATION FROM SMALL

00:46:38.195 --> 00:46:39.963
BUSINESS OWNERS, WHO SAID, WE

WOULD LIKE TO HAVE STANDARD

00:46:41.365 --> 00:46:43.200
TERMS. IF WE GET THIS CLARITY,

00:46:43.267 --> 00:46:44.535
WE COULD MAKE BETTER DECISIONS

00:46:44.601 --> 00:46:47.804
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES.

00:46:47.871 --> 00:46:50.507
THIS BILL IS A MODEST MOTION TO

00:46:50.574 --> 00:46:51.975

LEARNED FROM OUR GOOD EXAMPLE

00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:58.115
AND FIXED A COUPLE OF THINGS.

00:46:58.182 --> 00:46:59.416
WE'RE CATCHING UP AND CHIEFLY

00:46:59.483 --> 00:47:00.817
REQUIRES FINANCING COMPANIES TO

00:47:00.884 --> 00:47:02.252

THEIR RATES, INCLUDING OUTSIDE

00:47:03.887 --> 00:47:05.789
OF THE DISCLOSURE BOX. IF ANYONE

00:47:05.856 --> 00:47:07.824
WANTS TO SEE WHAT THE BOX LOOKS

00:47:07.891 --> 00:47:09.593
LIKE, THAT IS NOW STANDARD. I'VE

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:10.861
GOT ONE HERE, AND THIS JUST

00:47:10.928 --> 00:47:12.196

ORGANIZATION OF RESPONSIBLE

00:48:39.516 --> 00:48:40.917

SENATOR GRAYSON ON SB 362, AND

00:48:48.225 --> 00:48:49.926
WE RESPECTFULLY THANK HIM FOR

00:48:49.993 --> 00:48:51.695
MODIFYING THE LANGUAGE WITH

00:48:51.762 --> 00:48:53.096
REGARD TO THE UNDERWRITING

00:48:53.163 --> 00:48:54.064
PROCESS. HOWEVER, WE CONTINUE TO

00:48:54.131 --> 00:48:55.932
TAKE EXCEPTION WITH PARAGRAPH C,

00:48:55.999 --> 00:48:57.801
WHICH ADDRESSES COMMUNICATION

00:48:57.868 --> 00:49:00.370
WITH PROSPECTIVE CLIENTS. AS

00:49:00.437 --> 00:49:01.305
DRAFTED, THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE

00:49:01.371 --> 00:49:03.640
AN APRIL DISCLOSURE AS PART OF

00:49:03.707 --> 00:49:05.676
ANY COMMUNICATIONS, WHICH MY

00:49:05.742 --> 00:49:07.210
CLIENTS INDICATE WOULD STIFLE A

00:49:07.277 --> 00:49:08.912
BUSINESS APPLICANT'S ABILITY TO

00:49:08.979 --> 00:49:10.747
INFORMALLY DISCUSS DIFFERENT

00:49:10.814 --> 00:49:12.883
FINANCING OPTIONS BEFORE THE

00:49:12.949 --> 00:49:14.851
FINANCING PROVIDERS READY TO

00:49:14.918 --> 00:49:17.921
PRESENT A SPECIFIC OFFER. RFC'S

00:49:17.988 --> 00:49:19.222
REGULATORY ATTORNEY BELIEVES

00:49:19.289 --> 00:49:20.957
THAT THIS LANGUAGE WOULD RESULT

00:49:21.024 --> 00:49:23.160
IN PROVIDERS NOT BEING ABLE TO

00:49:23.226 --> 00:49:25.095
DISCUSS ANY DEAL TERMS

00:49:25.162 --> 00:49:26.396
INFORMALLY, AND INSTEAD REQUIRE

00:49:26.463 --> 00:49:28.732
THAT EVERYTHING BE IN WRITING.

00:49:28.799 --> 00:49:29.466
OTHERWISE, HOW WOULD THE

00:49:29.533 --> 00:49:31.301
FINANCING PROVIDER BE ABLE TO

00:49:31.368 --> 00:49:33.170
SHOW COMPLIANCE WITH THE APRIL

00:49:33.236 --> 00:49:34.771
DISCLOSURE OBLIGATION? PROVIDING

00:49:34.838 --> 00:49:36.006
AN APRIL DISCLOSURE FOR A LOAN

00:49:36.073 --> 00:49:37.641
IS PRETTY SIMPLE, AS THE LENDER

00:49:37.708 --> 00:49:39.476
CAN PLUG IN THE INFO AND QUICKLY

00:49:39.543 --> 00:49:42.612
FIND OUT THE APRIL. HOWEVER, FOR

00:49:42.679 --> 00:49:43.580
TRANSACTIONS LIKE THOSE PROVIDED

00:49:43.647 --> 00:49:45.949
IN REVENUE BASED FINANCING, THE

00:49:46.016 --> 00:49:47.217
CALCULATION IS MORE INVOLVED AND

00:49:47.284 --> 00:49:49.152
NOT SO EASY TO DO DURING

00:49:49.219 --> 00:49:51.455
NEGOTIATIONS. OUR BFC RECOMMENDS

00:49:51.521 --> 00:49:53.990
THAT RATHER THAN SIMPLY STATE

00:49:54.057 --> 00:49:55.359
COMMUNICATIONS, THE CALIFORNIA

00:49:55.425 --> 00:49:57.294
FOLLOW THE MODEL USED IN NEW

00:49:57.361 --> 00:49:58.595
YORK, WHICH REQUIRES THAT WHEN A

00:49:58.662 --> 00:49:59.696
PROVIDER STATES A RATE OF

00:49:59.763 --> 00:50:01.531
FINANCE CHARGE TO A RECIPIENT

00:50:01.598 --> 00:50:03.266
DURING THE APPLICATION PROCESS

00:50:03.333 --> 00:50:04.534
FOR COMMERCIAL FINANCING, THAT

00:50:04.601 --> 00:50:06.136
AT THAT TIME, THE PROVIDER SHALL

00:50:06.203 --> 00:50:08.405
ALSO STATE THE RATE IS AN APR OR

00:50:08.472 --> 00:50:09.740
THE ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE.

00:50:09.806 --> 00:50:11.108
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I THINK

00:50:11.174 --> 00:50:12.976
THIS IS SOMETHING WE PROBABLY

00:50:13.043 --> 00:50:14.511
CAN CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE

00:50:14.578 --> 00:50:15.445
AUTHOR ON AND MAYBE GET THERE,

00:50:15.512 --> 00:50:17.147
BECAUSE WE DO HAVE THAT MODEL IN

00:50:17.214 --> 00:50:18.682
NEW YORK TO LOOK AT. THANK YOU,

00:50:18.749 --> 00:50:20.050

00:50:22.686 --> 00:50:24.187
WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL

00:50:24.254 --> 00:50:25.722
OPPOSED POSITION ON THE BILL. I

00:50:25.789 --> 00:50:27.057
WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE'VE

00:50:27.124 --> 00:50:27.958
HAD REALLY GOOD CONVERSATIONS

00:50:28.024 --> 00:50:29.259
WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE AND THE

00:50:29.326 --> 00:50:30.761
SPONSORS OF THE MEASURE. I WANT

00:50:30.827 --> 00:50:33.096
TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING

00:50:33.163 --> 00:50:36.032
THE AMENDMENTS IN SUBSECTION A,

00:50:36.099 --> 00:50:39.669
B, AND IN D, PARTICULARLY THE

00:50:39.736 --> 00:50:41.338
MARGIN OVER INDEX RATE LANGUAGE,

00:50:41.405 --> 00:50:42.739
WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO US

00:50:42.806 --> 00:50:45.108
AND HAS BEEN A FOCAL POINT OF

00:50:45.175 --> 00:50:45.776
OUR CONVERSATIONS. WE DO SHARE

00:50:45.842 --> 00:50:47.144
SOME OF THE SAME CONCERNS

00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:49.012
RELATED TO SUBSECTION C, AND

00:50:49.079 --> 00:50:50.347
WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE WORKING

00:50:50.414 --> 00:50:51.548
ON THAT LANGUAGE. AS BEEN

00:50:51.615 --> 00:50:53.550
POINTED OUT, THIS IS SUPPOSED TO

00:50:53.617 --> 00:50:55.152
BE MODELED ON NEW YORK LAW. IT

00:50:55.218 --> 00:50:57.120
IS NOT IDENTICAL TO NEW YORK

00:50:57.187 --> 00:50:58.155
LAW, AND QUITE FRANKLY, WE DON'T

00:50:58.221 --> 00:50:59.723
LOVE NEW YORK LAW TO BEGIN WITH.

00:50:59.790 --> 00:51:01.558
ANYWAY, WE'D LIKE TO REALLY COME

00:51:01.625 --> 00:51:02.926
TO SOME RESOLUTION ON SECTION C,

00:51:02.993 --> 00:51:03.894
AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:05.295
CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS. THANK

00:51:05.362 --> 00:51:07.097
YOU. WONDERFUL. THANK YOU.

00:51:07.164 --> 00:51:08.632
THAT'S RIGHT. WE'RE CALIFORNIA

00:51:08.698 --> 00:51:09.933
AND WE LIKE IT THE CALIFORNIA

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.202
WAY. RIGHT. EXACTLY. BRINGING

00:51:12.269 --> 00:51:14.271
THE DISCUSSION BACK TO

00:51:14.337 --> 00:51:15.772
COMMITTEE. DO WE HAVE ANY

00:51:15.839 --> 00:51:19.042
QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE. SENATOR

00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:20.410
GRAYSON, WOULD YOU LIKE TO

00:51:20.477 --> 00:51:22.212
CLOSE? YES. I JUST WANT TO STATE

00:51:22.279 --> 00:51:23.980
ONCE AGAIN, I REMAIN VERY, VERY

00:51:24.047 --> 00:51:25.949
COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK

00:51:26.016 --> 00:51:27.451
WITH THE VERY KIND OPPOSITION OR

00:51:27.517 --> 00:51:30.954
TWEENER POSITIONS TO MAKE SURE

00:51:31.021 --> 00:51:33.390
WE FIND A GOOD LANDING SPOT. AND

00:51:33.457 --> 00:51:35.192
THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR

00:51:35.258 --> 00:51:36.126
THE AMENDMENTS THAT MADE THIS

00:51:36.193 --> 00:51:38.862
BILL A LOT CLEARER AND BETTER.

00:51:38.929 --> 00:51:39.529
SO WITH THAT, I RESPECTFULLY ASK

00:51:39.596 --> 00:51:42.098
FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. DO

00:51:42.165 --> 00:51:44.067
WE HAVE A MOTION? SECOND.

00:51:44.134 --> 00:51:46.870
WONDERFUL. THANK YOU. SENATOR.

00:51:46.937 --> 00:51:48.438
COMING FROM A SMALL BUSINESS

00:51:48.505 --> 00:51:49.606
FAMILY, I REALLY DO APPRECIATE

00:51:49.673 --> 00:51:51.208
THIS TYPE OF LEGISLATION. IT'S

00:51:51.274 --> 00:51:52.709
GOOD FOR SMALL BUSINESSES IN

00:51:52.776 --> 00:51:54.911
PARTICULAR, AND WE NEED TO DO AS

00:51:54.978 --> 00:51:55.579
MUCH AS POSSIBLE CONSIDERING THE

00:51:55.645 --> 00:51:58.181
STATE OF OUR ECONOMY. SO WITH

00:51:58.248 --> 00:51:59.716
THAT, MADAM SECRETARY, CAN YOU

00:51:59.783 --> 00:52:02.452
PLEASE CALL THE ROLL SB 362? THE

00:52:02.519 --> 00:52:03.920
MOTION IS DUE PASSED AND

00:52:03.987 --> 00:52:04.554
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE ON

00:52:04.621 --> 00:52:06.756
JUDICIARY. VALENCIA. VALENCIA.

00:52:06.823 --> 00:52:09.993
AYE. CHEN. DIXON. DIXON. AYE.

MICHELLE. RODRIGUEZ. AYE.

00:52:15.866 --> 00:52:20.770
BLANCA. RUBIO. SCHIAVO. SORIA.

00:52:20.837 --> 00:52:25.542
SORIA. AYE. THE BILL PASSES. WE

00:52:25.609 --> 00:52:27.410
WILL LEAVE THE ROLL OPEN FOR

00:52:27.477 --> 00:52:29.145
ABSENT MEMBERS. WE WILL NOW MOVE

00:52:29.212 --> 00:52:32.782
ON TO SB 784. SENATOR DURAZO,

00:52:32.849 --> 00:52:34.651
THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO PASS TO

00:52:34.718 --> 00:52:37.387
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.

00:52:37.454 --> 00:52:38.588
SENATOR, WHEN YOU ARE READY,

00:52:38.655 --> 00:52:55.605
PLEASE BEGIN. YOUR. WHO ARE YOU?

00:52:55.672 --> 00:53:00.443
GOOD TO SEE YOU. OKAY. GOOD

00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:02.345
AFTERNOON, MR. CHAIR. AND

00:53:02.412 --> 00:53:04.381
MEMBERS. I APPRECIATE BEING

00:53:04.447 --> 00:53:06.149
HERE. AND I'M GOING TO START BY

00:53:06.216 --> 00:53:07.751
ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE

00:53:07.817 --> 00:53:08.618
AMENDMENTS AND THANKING YOUR

00:53:08.685 --> 00:53:11.354
STAFF VERY MUCH FOR ALL OF THEIR

00:53:11.421 --> 00:53:13.423
HARD, HARD WORK. AND I WANT TO

00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:15.258
HIGHLIGHT A MAJOR AMENDMENT THAT

00:53:15.325 --> 00:53:18.428
I AM MAKING TODAY, AND THAT IS

00:53:18.495 --> 00:53:20.330
CONCEDING TO THE LENDER

00:53:20.397 --> 00:53:22.766
LIABILITY PROVISION IN SB 784,

00:53:22.832 --> 00:53:25.735
WHICH IS HAS BEEN A VERY

00:53:25.802 --> 00:53:28.405
SIGNIFICANT PART OF MY BILL.

00:53:28.471 --> 00:53:30.273
SOLAR INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS AND

00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:32.008
I HAVE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER

00:53:32.075 --> 00:53:33.476
SINCE FEBRUARY, AND THEY HAVE

00:53:33.543 --> 00:53:36.446
ALSO AGREED TO CHANGES AND

00:53:36.513 --> 00:53:37.948
CONCESSIONS ON ISSUES IMPORTANT

00:53:38.014 --> 00:53:39.716
TO THEM. THIS IS A MAJOR

00:53:39.783 --> 00:53:41.484
COMPROMISE THAT IS A PRODUCT OF

00:53:41.551 --> 00:53:43.286
MONTHS OF CONVERSATION AND

00:53:43.353 --> 00:53:45.789
MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING. LET ME BE

00:53:45.855 --> 00:53:48.692
CLEAR ABOUT WHAT SB 784 DOES AND

00:53:48.758 --> 00:53:51.528
DOESN'T AIM TO DO. THE GOAL IS

00:53:51.595 --> 00:53:54.097
NOT TO GET RID OF AN INDUSTRY OR

00:53:54.164 --> 00:53:55.832
TO REDUCE MARKET COMPETITION.

00:53:55.899 --> 00:53:58.468
THE GOAL IS TO PUT SOME SIMPLE

00:53:58.535 --> 00:54:00.270
GUARDRAILS AROUND A NICHE

00:54:00.337 --> 00:54:02.205
INDUSTRY THAT HAS BEEN OPERATING

00:54:02.272 --> 00:54:04.808
IN THE SHADOWS FOR TOO LONG. BAD

00:54:04.874 --> 00:54:06.710
ACTORS IN THIS INDUSTRY HAVE

00:54:06.776 --> 00:54:08.678
TRICKED TOO MANY HOMEOWNERS INTO

00:54:08.745 --> 00:54:10.580
DEBT FOR HOME. IMPROVEMENTS THAT

00:54:10.647 --> 00:54:12.782
WERE NEVER FINISHED, NEVER

00:54:12.849 --> 00:54:15.018
WORKED, OR WERE NEVER CLEARLY

00:54:15.085 --> 00:54:16.319
EXPLAINED IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:54:16.386 --> 00:54:19.222
THEY TARGET SENIORS, NON-ENGLISH

00:54:19.289 --> 00:54:20.557
SPEAKERS, PEOPLE OF COLOR, AND

00:54:20.624 --> 00:54:22.959
THOSE WHO ARE LESS FAMILIAR WITH

00:54:23.026 --> 00:54:24.995
DIGITAL PLATFORMS. I FIRST HEARD

00:54:25.061 --> 00:54:27.497
ABOUT THIS PROBLEM FROM MY OWN

00:54:27.564 --> 00:54:28.598
CONSTITUENTS, WHO WERE SCAMMED

00:54:28.665 --> 00:54:31.134
WHEN ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT

00:54:31.201 --> 00:54:32.469
SALESPEOPLE KNOCKED ON THEIR

00:54:32.535 --> 00:54:34.904
DOOR. MY CONSTITUENTS ARE NOW

00:54:34.971 --> 00:54:37.507
DROWNING IN DEBT, FACING DAMAGED

00:54:37.574 --> 00:54:38.808
CREDIT, AND SOME ARE ENDING UP

00:54:38.875 --> 00:54:40.810
IN THE EMERGENCY FROM THE

00:54:40.877 --> 00:54:42.712
STRESS. THESE DEALS OFTEN START

00:54:42.779 --> 00:54:45.515
WITH A SMILE, USUALLY AT THE

00:54:45.582 --> 00:54:47.450
CONSUMERS FRONT DOOR. I KNOW

00:54:47.517 --> 00:54:49.185
BECAUSE IT'S HAPPENED TO ME, BUT

00:54:49.252 --> 00:54:51.521
IT ESCALATES QUICKLY. A

00:54:51.588 --> 00:54:53.790
CONTRACTOR PITCHES A NO COST

00:54:53.857 --> 00:54:55.992
UPGRADE OR REBATE BACKED

00:54:56.059 --> 00:54:58.128
IMPROVEMENT, SOMETIMES SOLAR

00:54:58.194 --> 00:55:00.163
PANELS. THE HOMEOWNER IS HANDED

00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:02.565
A TABLET AND TOLD TO QUICKLY

00:55:02.632 --> 00:55:05.101
SIGN BECAUSE THE DEAL WILL GO

00:55:05.168 --> 00:55:07.037
OFF THE TABLE. THE HOMEOWNERS

00:55:07.103 --> 00:55:08.505
BELIEVE THEY'RE SIGNING UP FOR A

00:55:08.571 --> 00:55:10.774
QUOTE OR A PUBLIC PROGRAM.

00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:12.642
BEHIND THE SCENES. THAT

00:55:12.709 --> 00:55:14.277
CONTRACTOR IS ACTING AS A LOAN

00:55:14.344 --> 00:55:16.579
AGENT FOR THE LENDER, USING THE

00:55:16.646 --> 00:55:18.948
LENDER'S SOFTWARE AND LOAN TERMS

00:55:19.015 --> 00:55:20.850
ESTABLISHED BY THE LENDER. THE

00:55:20.917 --> 00:55:23.386
LENDER AND CONTRACTOR HAVE A

00:55:23.453 --> 00:55:24.220
FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIP, EVEN

00:55:24.287 --> 00:55:26.790
THROUGH HIDDEN DEALER FEES. THE

00:55:26.856 --> 00:55:28.658
CONTRACTOR IS OFTEN PAID BY THE

00:55:28.725 --> 00:55:31.261
LENDER BEFORE THE PROJECT IS

00:55:31.327 --> 00:55:33.463
COMPLETED OR OPERATIONAL.

00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:34.831
HOMEOWNERS OFTEN DON'T REALIZE

00:55:34.898 --> 00:55:37.000
THEY'VE SIGNED A LOAN, OR THAT

00:55:37.067 --> 00:55:39.669
IT MAY COME WITH A LIEN ON THEIR

00:55:39.736 --> 00:55:41.838
PROPERTY. A SHORT TIME LATER,

00:55:41.905 --> 00:55:42.839
THEY'RE GETTING BILLED FOR A

00:55:42.906 --> 00:55:44.874
SYSTEM THAT DOESN'T WORK. THE

00:55:44.941 --> 00:55:46.710
CONTRACTOR IS GONE. THE LENDER

00:55:46.776 --> 00:55:48.244
DENIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE

00:55:48.311 --> 00:55:49.913
PROJECT NOT WORKING. THE

00:55:49.979 --> 00:55:52.115
HOMEOWNER IS LEFT WITH THE DEBT

00:55:52.182 --> 00:55:55.018
AND NO WAY OUT. IF OUR CURRENT

00:55:55.085 --> 00:55:57.387
PROTECTIONS WERE WORKING, WE

00:55:57.454 --> 00:55:59.055
WOULDN'T BE SEEING THIS LEVEL OF

00:55:59.122 --> 00:56:02.225
HARM. LEGISLATURA, REGULATORS

00:56:02.292 --> 00:56:04.427
AND WATCHDOGS ARE SAYING AND

00:56:04.494 --> 00:56:06.429
SEEN LIKE THE CONTRACTOR STATE

00:56:06.496 --> 00:56:10.567
LICENSING BOARD HAS SEEN, A 154%

00:56:10.633 --> 00:56:13.103
INCREASE IN COMPLAINTS SINCE

00:56:13.169 --> 00:56:15.238
2019. THIS HAS PROMPTED THE

00:56:15.305 --> 00:56:17.741
CREATION OF A NEW ENFORCEMENT

00:56:17.807 --> 00:56:19.843
UNIT AND THE RETURN OF RETIRED

00:56:19.909 --> 00:56:22.312
STAFF TO HANDLE THE SURGE IN

00:56:22.378 --> 00:56:24.647
COMPLAINTS. THE CENTER FOR

00:56:24.714 --> 00:56:26.516
RESPONSIBLE LENDING COMPARES THE

00:56:26.583 --> 00:56:28.485
TACTICS USED IN THIS MARKET TO

00:56:28.551 --> 00:56:31.020
THOSE USED IN THE SUB PRIME

00:56:31.087 --> 00:56:32.789
MORTGAGE CRISIS THAT WE ALL

00:56:32.856 --> 00:56:34.591
REMEMBER. WE'VE EVEN SEEN A

00:56:34.657 --> 00:56:36.526
STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL IN

00:56:36.593 --> 00:56:38.361
MULTIPLE STATES TAKE THESE

00:56:38.428 --> 00:56:40.363
ACTORS TO COURT, INCLUDING SOME

00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:42.832
THAT OPERATE IN THIS STATE. BUT

00:56:42.899 --> 00:56:44.100
CALIFORNIANS SHOULDN'T HAVE TO

00:56:44.167 --> 00:56:46.569
RESORT TO A LAWSUIT TO GET

00:56:46.636 --> 00:56:48.438
JUSTICE, AND MANY DON'T HAVE

00:56:48.505 --> 00:56:51.241
THAT ACCESS. WE CAN ACT NOW.

00:56:51.307 --> 00:56:52.642
THIS ESSENTIAL PROTECTIONS OF

00:56:52.709 --> 00:56:55.545
THIS BILL ARE ONE REQUIRES A

00:56:55.612 --> 00:56:57.247
CONFIRMATION CALL BETWEEN THE

00:56:57.313 --> 00:56:59.482
LENDER AND THE BORROWER BEFORE A

00:56:59.549 --> 00:57:02.418
LOAN IS FINALIZED, WITHOUT THE

00:57:02.485 --> 00:57:04.454
SALESPERSON BEING PRESENT, A

00:57:04.521 --> 00:57:06.022
CONSUMER WOULD BE PROTECTED,

00:57:06.089 --> 00:57:08.525
TOO, FROM PAYING FOR A HOME

00:57:08.591 --> 00:57:11.027
IMPROVEMENT PROJECT UNTIL IT'S

00:57:11.094 --> 00:57:13.863
CONFIRMED TO BE COMPLETE AND

00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:16.065
OPERATIONAL. IT ENSURES

00:57:16.132 --> 00:57:17.734
CUSTOMERS. CONSUMERS CAN ACCESS

00:57:17.801 --> 00:57:20.737
THEIR LOAN AND PROJECT DOCUMENTS

00:57:20.804 --> 00:57:23.339
AND PROJECT DOCUMENTS. ADDS A

00:57:23.406 --> 00:57:24.641
TRANSPARENCY AROUND HIDDEN

00:57:24.707 --> 00:57:27.343
DEALER FEES, AND EXTENDS THE

00:57:27.410 --> 00:57:28.745
CANCELLATION PERIOD SO CONSUMERS

00:57:28.812 --> 00:57:31.514
HAVE TIME TO RECONSIDER. I'M

00:57:31.581 --> 00:57:33.249
COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH WELLS

00:57:33.316 --> 00:57:35.451
FARGO AND THE OTHER BANKING

00:57:35.518 --> 00:57:37.320
INSTITUTIONS IN GOOD FAITH TO

00:57:37.387 --> 00:57:40.223
TRY TO FIND AN ELEGANT SOLUTION

00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:41.958
FOR AMENDMENTS THAT

00:57:42.025 --> 00:57:42.992
DIFFERENTIATE THE GOOD ACTORS

00:57:43.059 --> 00:57:45.528
AND BAD ACTORS IN THIS INDUSTRY

00:57:45.595 --> 00:57:47.363
THAT DO NOT UNDERMINE THE REST

00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:49.799
OF THE BILL. AND I'VE ASKED THE

00:57:49.866 --> 00:57:51.334
ASSEMBLY BANKING COMMITTEE TO

00:57:51.401 --> 00:57:53.169
REMAIN INVOLVED IN THESE

00:57:53.236 --> 00:57:55.638
CONVERSATIONS. ULTIMATELY, SB

00:57:55.705 --> 00:57:57.841
784 INSURANCE CALIFORNIANS

00:57:57.907 --> 00:58:00.343
AREN'T STUCK PAYING FOR HOME

00:58:00.410 --> 00:58:01.845
IMPROVEMENTS THEY NEVER AGREED

00:58:01.911 --> 00:58:04.280
TO OR NEVER RECEIVED. IT SETS A

00:59:44.013 --> 00:59:45.415
SECURITY, AND THE SALESPERSON

00:59:45.481 --> 00:59:46.649
CONFIRMED THAT THE IMPROVEMENTS

00:59:46.716 --> 00:59:48.217
WOULD BE SUBSIDIZED AND

00:59:48.284 --> 00:59:50.153
GUARANTEED TO BE AFFORDABLE. ON

00:59:50.219 --> 00:59:51.487
MULTIPLE OCCASIONS, THE

00:59:51.554 --> 00:59:52.622
SALESPERSON FRAUDULENTLY

00:59:52.689 --> 00:59:54.357
OBTAINED MR. LOPEZ'S ELECTRONIC

SIGNATURE ON DOCUMENTS, AND

00:59:56.326 --> 00:59:57.827
WHILE SOME OF THE SOME WORK WAS

00:59:57.894 --> 00:59:59.629
DONE ON THE HOME, MUCH OF IT

00:59:59.696 --> 01:00:01.164
WASN'T, WITH WHOLE PROJECTS NOT

01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:02.632
EVEN COMMENCED. AND YET, MR.

01:00:02.699 --> 01:00:04.434
LOPEZ IS GETTING BILLED BY SEVEN

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:05.868
DIFFERENT LENDERS, NONE OF WHOM

01:00:05.935 --> 01:00:08.137
HE'S EVER HEARD OF OR SPOKEN TO

01:00:08.204 --> 01:00:09.372
ON LOANS THAT HE NEVER AGREED

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:12.408
TO. AND THIS STORY IS

01:00:12.475 --> 01:00:13.409
UNFORTUNATELY NOT RARE. WE SEE

01:00:13.476 --> 01:00:15.645
IT EVERY DAY. IT'S THE SAME

01:00:15.712 --> 01:00:17.380
FACTS OVER AND OVER AGAIN. A LOW

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:19.515
INCOME SENIOR APPROACHED AT HOME

01:00:19.582 --> 01:00:21.250
THE FALSE PROMISE OF ENERGY

01:00:21.317 --> 01:00:22.752
SAVINGS AND GOVERNMENT

01:00:22.819 --> 01:00:24.320
SUBSIDIES, THE USE OF ELECTRONIC

01:00:24.387 --> 01:00:25.955
SIGNATURE FRAUD, AND THEN THE

01:00:26.022 --> 01:00:27.156
CONSUMER BEING BILLED BY A

01:00:27.223 --> 01:00:28.458
LENDER THEY'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD

01:00:28.524 --> 01:00:30.059
OF FOR SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T

01:00:30.126 --> 01:00:31.828
WORK. SO THIS IS HAPPENING

01:00:31.894 --> 01:00:33.930
ACROSS CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW.

01:00:33.997 --> 01:00:35.331
HOMEOWNERS ARE BEARING THE FULL

01:00:35.398 --> 01:00:36.566
BURDEN OF THE DECEPTIVE

01:00:36.632 --> 01:00:37.834
PRACTICES BEING USED AGAINST

01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:39.602
THEM, WHILE THE BUSINESSES

01:00:39.669 --> 01:00:41.938
PROFIT. SB 74 IS TRYING TO

01:00:42.005 --> 01:00:43.373
ADDRESS THIS IMMENSE IMBALANCE

01:00:43.439 --> 01:00:44.707
BY ENSURING THAT CONSUMERS

01:00:44.774 --> 01:00:46.175
UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING AND

01:00:46.242 --> 01:00:48.277
ONLY PAY FOR WHAT THEY ACTUALLY

01:00:48.344 --> 01:00:50.880
RECEIVE. AND I WILL JUST END BY

01:00:50.947 --> 01:00:52.048
REITERATING WHAT THE SENATOR

01:00:52.115 --> 01:00:53.349

FINANCIALLY INSECURE HOUSEHOLDS

01:01:05.661 --> 01:01:07.030
ARE BEING LEFT IN EVEN WORSE

01:01:07.096 --> 01:01:08.765
CONDITION BY THESE TRANSACTIONS.

01:01:08.831 --> 01:01:10.700

01:01:58.347 --> 01:02:00.750
ABOUT ANY SORT OF ASPECT OF, OF

01:02:00.817 --> 01:02:02.218
THE INDUSTRY, BUT I'M

01:02:02.285 --> 01:02:03.753
PRINCIPALLY HERE TO TALK ABOUT

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:05.888
THE DEALER FEE PROVISION IN THE

01:02:05.955 --> 01:02:07.156
LEGISLATION. I BELIEVE IT'S

01:02:07.223 --> 01:02:09.325
SECTION 11, AND I CAN GO INTO AS

01:02:09.392 --> 01:02:11.060
MUCH DETAIL AS THE COMMITTEE

01:02:11.127 --> 01:02:12.295
WANTS ON THAT, BUT I'LL KEEP MY

01:02:12.361 --> 01:02:14.564
REMARKS SHORT AND THEN TAKE

01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:15.798
QUESTIONS. THE THIS IS AN ISSUE

01:02:15.865 --> 01:02:17.900
WHERE, DUE TO A SORT OF QUIRK OF

01:02:17.967 --> 01:02:21.204
FEDERAL LAW, LENDERS ARE ABLE TO

01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:22.738
EFFECTIVELY HIDE SOME OF THE

01:02:22.805 --> 01:02:25.007
COST OF THE LOAN IN WHAT IS WHAT

01:02:25.074 --> 01:02:27.076
IS CALLED A DEALER FEE. THIS IS

01:02:27.143 --> 01:02:28.778
A FEE THAT IS SORT OF

01:02:28.845 --> 01:02:31.147
TECHNICALLY PAID BY THE BY THE

01:02:31.214 --> 01:02:33.449
INSTALLER, BUT IN ALMOST ALL

01:02:33.516 --> 01:02:35.351
CASES PASSED ON TO THE BORROWER

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:37.086
WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE. AND

01:02:37.153 --> 01:02:38.588
THIS IS SORT OF LIKE BUYING

01:02:38.654 --> 01:02:39.956
POINTS ON A MORTGAGE. IT BUYS

01:02:40.022 --> 01:02:42.925
DOWN THE INTEREST RATE. THE

01:02:42.992 --> 01:02:44.660
BORROWER SEES, YOU KNOW, A 2%

01:02:44.727 --> 01:02:45.628
INTEREST RATE, 3% INTEREST RATE.

01:02:45.695 --> 01:02:47.063
THEY THINK, WOW, THAT'S AMAZING.

01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:48.664
I'M NOT GOING TO SHOP AROUND.

01:02:48.731 --> 01:02:50.666
BUT IN REALITY, THE LOAN

01:02:50.733 --> 01:02:52.502
PRINCIPAL HAS BEEN INFLATED BY

01:02:52.568 --> 01:02:55.104
THIS FEE THAT HAS BEEN PASSED ON

01:02:55.171 --> 01:02:55.771
TO THEM WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE.

01:02:55.838 --> 01:02:57.206
THERE'S A VERY IMPORTANT

01:02:57.273 --> 01:02:58.708

ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS? WE'LL

01:07:50.466 --> 01:07:53.169
START WITH OUR INCREDIBLE VICE

01:07:53.235 --> 01:07:55.471

THE SENATOR FOR THE INTENTION OF

01:08:01.210 --> 01:08:02.211
THIS BILL, TO HAVE MORE

01:08:02.278 --> 01:08:02.978
TRANSPARENCY, IF YOU WILL, AS

01:08:03.045 --> 01:08:04.747
WELL AS CONSUMER ADVOCACY. I DO

01:08:04.814 --> 01:08:06.916
HAVE SOME CONCERNS IN REGARDS TO

01:08:06.982 --> 01:08:09.018
THE BILL. I BELIEVE THAT THERE'S

01:08:09.084 --> 01:08:11.887
A NEW REQUIREMENT TO HAVE ANY

01:08:11.954 --> 01:08:13.856
TYPE OF NEW PAYMENT OR ANY TYPE

01:08:13.923 --> 01:08:15.858
OF PAYMENT TO BE DONE FOR ANY

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:17.293
TYPE OF HOME IMPROVEMENT

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:19.228
PROJECT. THERE'S A COUPLE OF

01:08:19.295 --> 01:08:20.529
THINGS THAT REQUIRED IN ORDER

01:08:20.596 --> 01:08:22.031
FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. HOW DID YOU

01:08:22.097 --> 01:08:24.033
COME UP WITH YOUR NEW

01:08:24.099 --> 01:08:25.534
ACCOUNTABILITY OR YOUR NEW

01:08:25.601 --> 01:08:28.370
METHODOLOGY BEFORE A PAYMENT IS

01:08:28.437 --> 01:08:32.374
GOING TO BE PAID, IF YOU WILL?

01:08:32.441 --> 01:08:35.211
HOW DID THAT COME ABOUT, AND HOW

01:08:35.277 --> 01:08:37.613
DID YOU COME ABOUT THIS NEW

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:38.147
METHODOLOGY? YEAH. ARE YOU

01:08:38.214 --> 01:08:40.216
TALKING ABOUT THE REPAYMENT

01:08:40.282 --> 01:08:42.685
PROCESS? YEAH. YEAH. WE WHAT WE

01:08:42.751 --> 01:08:44.720
FOUND IS WHAT WE FOUND IN CASE

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:47.523
AFTER CASE WAS ONCE PEOPLE

01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:50.025
STARTED PAYING THEN, YOU KNOW,

01:08:50.092 --> 01:08:51.627
THAT WAS THAT WAS IT. THERE WERE

01:08:51.694 --> 01:08:53.562
THERE WERE STUCK. AND SO WE

01:08:53.629 --> 01:08:55.498
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY

01:08:55.564 --> 01:08:57.299
HAD THE PROTECTIONS BEFORE THEY

01:08:57.366 --> 01:08:58.834
STARTED THE REPAYMENT AND MAKE

01:08:58.901 --> 01:09:00.169
SURE, FOR EXAMPLE, THE PROJECT

01:09:00.236 --> 01:09:02.471
WAS ACTUALLY BUILT IF THE SOLAR

01:09:02.538 --> 01:09:03.973
PANEL, THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY

01:09:04.039 --> 01:09:05.207
CONNECTED TO THE GRID. I MEAN,

01:09:05.274 --> 01:09:08.511
WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:09:08.577 --> 01:09:10.179
REPAYMENT DIDN'T START BEFORE

01:09:10.246 --> 01:09:13.749
THEY WERE, BEFORE THEY COULD

01:09:13.816 --> 01:09:15.985
CONFIRM THAT THE PROJECT, THE

01:09:16.051 --> 01:09:18.053
SERVICE, WHATEVER THEY WAS

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:19.989
PROMISED WOULD ACTUALLY BE DONE.

01:09:20.055 --> 01:09:22.057
AND THAT'S WHERE THAT WAS A LOT

01:09:22.124 --> 01:09:24.560
OF IT. I DON'T KNOW IF YOUR

01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:26.462
EXPERIENCES, ANYBODY WANTS TO

01:09:26.529 --> 01:09:31.033
ADD. SURE, SURE. YEAH. SO WE SEE

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:33.569
IN THE ISSUE TO KIND OF JUST TO

01:09:33.636 --> 01:09:36.138
ADD ON TO WHAT THE SENATOR

01:09:36.205 --> 01:09:38.274
DISCUSSED IS THAT WE SEE A LOT

01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:40.342
OF FRAUD AT THIS STAGE AS WELL.

01:09:40.409 --> 01:09:43.245
RIGHT? WE SEE PEOPLE GETTING,

01:09:43.312 --> 01:09:45.748
YOU KNOW, GETTING PAID OR

01:09:45.814 --> 01:09:48.684
STARTING TO BILL WAY BEFORE, YOU

01:09:48.751 --> 01:09:49.685
KNOW, WHAT THEY'VE BEEN PROMISED

01:09:49.752 --> 01:09:51.987
HAS BEEN GIVEN. AND SO WHAT

01:09:52.054 --> 01:09:54.490
WE'VE LAID OUT IN THE BILL IS

01:09:54.557 --> 01:09:56.692
SOME, YOU KNOW, CLEAR WAYS TO

01:09:56.759 --> 01:09:58.928
GET JUST A BIT OF DUE DILIGENCE

01:09:58.994 --> 01:10:01.830
AT THIS STAGE TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:10:01.897 --> 01:10:03.599
THE CONSUMER ISN'T STARTING TO

01:10:03.666 --> 01:10:04.934
PAY BEFORE THEY GET ANY BENEFIT

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.202
OF THE BARGAIN. AND I CAN TALK

01:10:07.269 --> 01:10:10.539
MORE ABOUT THE SPECIFIC WAYS

01:10:10.606 --> 01:10:12.508
THAT WE SET OUT, IF THAT'S WHAT

01:10:12.575 --> 01:10:15.945
YOU'RE ASKING. SURE, SURE. SO IN

01:10:16.011 --> 01:10:18.047
THIS SO THERE'S KIND OF LIKE ALL

01:10:18.113 --> 01:10:20.416
HOME IMPROVEMENTS, RIGHT?

01:10:20.482 --> 01:10:21.717
OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT ALL HOME

01:10:21.784 --> 01:10:22.384
IMPROVEMENTS. IT'S ONES THAT ARE

01:10:22.451 --> 01:10:24.186
FINANCED. BUT THIS SPECIFIC KIND

01:10:24.253 --> 01:10:26.488
OF DOOR TO DOOR, YOU KNOW,

01:10:26.555 --> 01:10:30.125
DIRECT CONTRACTOR FUNDED LOANS.

01:10:30.192 --> 01:10:31.894
THERE'S TWO WAYS THAT BILLING

01:10:31.961 --> 01:10:35.097
CAN START. ONE IS THAT THERE'S

01:10:35.164 --> 01:10:36.832
BEEN A PERMIT SIGN OFF AND THAT

01:10:36.899 --> 01:10:38.233
THE CONSUMER HAS CONFIRMED THE

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:40.703
THING IS WORKING. AND BOTH OF

01:10:40.769 --> 01:10:42.638
THOSE THINGS ARE ABSOLUTELY

01:10:42.705 --> 01:10:44.540
NECESSARY. WE SEE A LOT OF FRAUD

01:10:44.607 --> 01:10:46.976
WITH ONLY CONSUMER SIGN OFF

01:10:47.042 --> 01:10:49.311
HAPPENING. WE SEE PEOPLE LIKE

01:10:49.378 --> 01:10:50.613
GETTING DEFRAUDED INTO SIGNING A

01:10:50.679 --> 01:10:51.780
CONFIRMATION CERTIFICATE EVEN AT

01:10:51.847 --> 01:10:53.515
THE TIME THE CONTRACT IS

01:10:53.582 --> 01:10:55.818
HAPPENING AT THE VERY BEGINNING.

01:10:55.884 --> 01:10:57.052
BUT WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT

01:10:57.119 --> 01:10:58.387
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF PERMITTING

01:10:58.454 --> 01:11:00.589
DELAYS, RIGHT. THAT WAS A

01:11:00.656 --> 01:11:01.423
CONCERN FROM INDUSTRY. SO WE

01:11:01.490 --> 01:11:02.791
ADDED THAT A REASONABLE

01:11:02.858 --> 01:11:03.859
INVESTIGATION THAT THE THING IS

01:11:03.926 --> 01:11:05.961
WORKING RIGHT. IF THEY CAN SHOW

01:11:06.028 --> 01:11:08.564
THAT THE THING IS WORKING EVEN

01:11:08.631 --> 01:11:10.165
BEFORE PERMIT SIGN OFF, AND EVEN

01:11:10.232 --> 01:11:12.001
IF THE CONSUMER DOESN'T AGREE,

01:11:12.067 --> 01:11:13.369
THEN THEY CAN STILL START

01:11:13.435 --> 01:11:18.407
BILLING FOR SOLAR PANELS. THAT

01:11:18.474 --> 01:11:19.808
OPERATION THAT HAPPENS THE

01:11:19.875 --> 01:11:20.943
MOMENT IT GETS PERMISSION TO

01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:22.277
OPERATE FROM THE UTILITY, THAT'S

01:11:22.344 --> 01:11:25.447
THE MOMENT THE SOLAR PANELS CAN

01:11:25.514 --> 01:11:27.049
TURN ON AND GET THE BENEFIT OF

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:28.717
THE BARGAIN. WOULD THIS ALSO

01:11:28.784 --> 01:11:31.687
APPLY TO ANY TYPE OF LOAN

01:11:31.754 --> 01:11:32.688
ACTIVITY THAT IS NOT DONE DOOR

01:11:32.755 --> 01:11:36.692
TO DOOR? OR THE ACCESS IS NOT

01:11:36.759 --> 01:11:40.062
HEARD VIA A DOOR TO DOOR TYPE OF

01:11:40.129 --> 01:11:42.264
SALE, IF YOU WILL? YEAH, IT

01:11:42.331 --> 01:11:43.599
COULD BE. DO YOU WANT ME TO GO?

01:11:43.666 --> 01:11:46.435
YEAH, SURE, SURE. SO THE IT KIND

01:11:46.502 --> 01:11:48.871
OF DEFINES THE SPECIFIC CONTRACT

01:11:48.937 --> 01:11:51.340
CALLED A HOME SOLICITATION SALE.

01:11:51.407 --> 01:11:52.941
AND SO THAT INCLUDES DOOR TO

01:11:53.008 --> 01:11:54.643
DOOR SALES. BUT IN CALIFORNIA IT

01:11:54.710 --> 01:11:56.879
ALSO INCLUDES SOME OTHER MOST OF

01:11:56.945 --> 01:11:58.213
WHAT WE SEE IS DOOR TO DOOR

01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:00.616
SALES. BUT THERE ARE ALSO SOME

01:12:00.683 --> 01:12:01.850
OTHER THINGS, YOU KNOW, THAT

01:12:01.917 --> 01:12:03.318
COME UP, LIKE IF IT'S IN A

01:12:03.385 --> 01:12:04.787
STORE, RIGHT, OR BY PHONE. IT'S

01:12:04.853 --> 01:12:07.623
SPECIFIC TO CALIFORNIA CASE LAW

01:12:07.690 --> 01:12:10.125
ESSENTIALLY WHERE. BUT IT DOES

01:12:10.192 --> 01:12:11.894
HAVE TO BE THIS SPECIFIC HOME

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:14.096
SOLICITATION SALE. THE LOAN ALSO

01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:17.066
HAS TO BE ONE WHERE THE FUNDS

01:12:17.132 --> 01:12:18.834
ARE RELEASED DIRECTLY TO THE

01:12:18.901 --> 01:12:20.235
CONTRACTOR. SO IF WE'RE TALKING

01:12:20.302 --> 01:12:22.438
ABOUT LENDING THAT, YOU KNOW, IS

01:12:22.504 --> 01:12:23.872
HAPPENING IN A BRICK AND MORTAR

01:12:23.939 --> 01:12:25.974
LOCATION OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT,

01:12:26.041 --> 01:12:28.577
IT DOESN'T FALL UNDER THE BILL

01:12:28.644 --> 01:12:31.013
UNLESS IT ENDS UP END UP AT A

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:33.248
HOUSE. RIGHT? RIGHT. IF. YEAH,

01:12:33.315 --> 01:12:35.184
IF THEY GO TO THE HOUSE. SO, YOU

01:12:35.250 --> 01:12:36.652
KNOW, IF A CONSUMER IS GOING

01:12:36.719 --> 01:12:38.520
INTO A BANK, YOU KNOW, TO GET TO

01:12:38.587 --> 01:12:40.489
GET FUNDING IN THAT, IN THAT

01:12:40.556 --> 01:12:41.857
BANK'S PLACE OF BUSINESS, IT

01:12:41.924 --> 01:12:43.659
DOESN'T FALL UNDER THE BILL.

01:12:43.726 --> 01:12:44.827
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT IS

01:12:44.893 --> 01:12:46.528
HELPFUL, MR. CHAIR, IF I MAY,

01:12:46.595 --> 01:12:47.930
THROUGH YOUR LEADERSHIP, IF I

01:12:47.996 --> 01:12:49.832
CAN ALSO ASK THE OPPOSITION A

01:12:49.898 --> 01:12:51.867
QUESTION AS WELL. THAT'S RIGHT.

01:12:51.934 --> 01:12:54.103
YES. THANK YOU. MAYBE THROUGH

01:12:54.169 --> 01:13:08.817
WELLS FARGO, IF THAT'S POSSIBLE.

01:13:08.884 --> 01:13:11.386
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. AND I WANT

01:13:11.453 --> 01:13:12.988
TO THANK THE SENATOR. I'VE HEARD

01:13:13.055 --> 01:13:14.289
A LOT FROM THE OPPOSITION, WHICH

01:13:14.356 --> 01:13:15.591
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY

01:13:15.657 --> 01:13:17.025
AND STEADFAST ON ADDRESSING

01:13:17.092 --> 01:13:18.861
THEIR CONCERNS. AND I THINK

01:13:18.927 --> 01:13:20.062
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY

01:13:20.129 --> 01:13:22.030
YOU HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS TO A

01:13:22.097 --> 01:13:23.398
NEUTRAL POSITION. SO I COMMEND

01:13:23.465 --> 01:13:25.267
YOU FOR THAT. I DO HAVE A

01:13:25.334 --> 01:13:26.502
REMAINING CONCERN, AND IT'S

01:13:26.568 --> 01:13:27.536
RELATED TO NON HOME IMPROVEMENT

01:13:27.603 --> 01:13:29.004
SERVICES. I BELIEVE THAT SOME OF

01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:30.839
THESE FOLKS DO NOT HAVE THE

01:13:30.906 --> 01:13:31.306
CAPACITY TO MANAGE THE

01:13:31.373 --> 01:13:33.075
PERMITTING PROCESS AND NOT HAVE

01:13:33.142 --> 01:13:34.510
THAT CASH FLOW IN ORDER, AND

01:13:34.576 --> 01:13:36.979
MIGHT BE KICKED OUT OF THE HOME

01:13:37.045 --> 01:13:37.613
IMPROVEMENT SERVICES FOR GOOD.

01:13:37.679 --> 01:13:38.247
AND UNDERSTAND FROM WELLS

01:13:38.313 --> 01:13:39.915
FARGO'S PERSPECTIVE THAT THERE'S

01:13:39.982 --> 01:13:41.950
SOME POTENTIAL AMENDMENTS THAT

01:13:42.017 --> 01:13:44.820
COULD BE APPLYING WHERE YOU CAN

01:13:44.887 --> 01:13:46.388
EITHER SUPPORT THE BILL OR MAKE

01:13:46.455 --> 01:13:48.457
IT NEUTRAL. I WANT TO GET A

01:13:48.524 --> 01:13:49.224
BETTER UNDERSTANDING IF IT'S

01:13:49.291 --> 01:13:51.293
POSSIBLE TO BE IN THIS COMMITTEE

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:53.529
OR THE NEXT COMMITTEE, WHERE

01:13:53.595 --> 01:13:54.163
SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT YOU

01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:57.232
HAVE CAN BE ADDRESSED TO HAVE A

01:13:57.299 --> 01:13:59.301
MORE SUPPORTIVE POSITION OF THE

01:13:59.368 --> 01:14:02.337
SENATOR'S BILL. SO WITH THAT.

01:14:02.404 --> 01:14:05.174
MR. KNUDSEN? SURE. I MEAN, OUR

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:06.241
OUR PRODUCT IS DIFFERENT THAN

01:14:06.308 --> 01:14:08.010
WHAT'S BEING TARGETED HERE AS

01:14:08.076 --> 01:14:09.978
YOU KIND OF GO DOWN THE LIST OF

01:14:10.045 --> 01:14:11.380
THE THINGS THAT THEY'RE

01:14:11.446 --> 01:14:12.881
CONCERNED ABOUT. WE DON'T DO

01:14:12.948 --> 01:14:14.216
THAT IN ALMOST EVERY ASPECT. AND

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:15.684
I THINK THERE'S PLENTY OF WAYS

01:14:15.751 --> 01:14:16.752
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE SENATOR

01:14:16.819 --> 01:14:18.854
WAS TALKING ABOUT. AND I FOUND

01:14:18.921 --> 01:14:20.155
THE SENATOR TO BE VERY TRUE TO

01:14:20.222 --> 01:14:23.258
HER WORD. AND IF SHE SAYS SHE'S

01:14:23.325 --> 01:14:24.159
GOING TO WORK ON IT, SHE WILL

01:14:24.226 --> 01:14:26.562
WORK ON IT. AND WE REALLY LOOK

01:14:26.628 --> 01:14:27.362
FORWARD TO DOING THAT. AND,

01:14:27.429 --> 01:14:29.431
SENATOR, I JUST WANTED TO THANK

01:14:29.498 --> 01:14:30.199
YOU AGAIN. AND IF I COULD GET

01:14:30.265 --> 01:14:31.700
YOUR COMMITMENT THAT YOU'LL BE

01:14:31.767 --> 01:14:33.869
CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS BILL

01:14:33.936 --> 01:14:35.170
AS IT MOVES ON, POTENTIALLY FROM

01:14:35.237 --> 01:14:36.371
THIS COMMITTEE TO THE NEXT. ON

01:14:36.438 --> 01:14:38.874
SOME OF THE OPPOSITION THAT YOU

01:14:38.941 --> 01:14:39.942
HEARD TODAY. YES. AND I SAID

01:14:40.008 --> 01:14:42.177
THIS TO THE REPRESENTATIVES OF

01:14:42.244 --> 01:14:44.313
WELLS FARGO FIRST. I SAID IT TO

01:14:44.379 --> 01:14:47.082
OUR CHAIR HERE, AND THEN I SAID

01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:49.384
IT TO THEM. AND I SET UP A

01:14:49.451 --> 01:14:53.956
MEETING VERY EARLY ONE MORNING.

01:14:54.022 --> 01:14:55.724
IT ONLY HAPPENED THEY ONLY CAME

01:14:55.791 --> 01:14:58.227
TO US A FEW DAYS AGO. SO I DID

01:14:58.293 --> 01:15:00.529
IT AS QUICKLY AS I COULD, AND I

01:15:00.596 --> 01:15:03.298
MADE IT CLEAR THEY AS LONG AS

01:15:03.365 --> 01:15:04.700
THEY'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING

01:15:04.766 --> 01:15:07.402
BY, YOU KNOW, POTENTIAL

01:15:07.469 --> 01:15:09.171
CUSTOMERS, THAT THEY'RE NOT THE

01:15:09.238 --> 01:15:12.040
ONES WE'RE GOING AFTER. BUT, YOU

01:15:12.107 --> 01:15:14.076
KNOW, WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:15:14.142 --> 01:15:16.078
WHATEVER AMENDMENT WE TAKE ISN'T

01:15:16.144 --> 01:15:18.914
GOING TO DESTROY THE PURPOSE OF

01:15:18.981 --> 01:15:20.315
THE PROTECTIONS THAT WE'RE

01:15:20.382 --> 01:15:22.784
SEEKING TO GIVE TO CONSUMERS.

01:15:22.851 --> 01:15:26.355
OKAY. SURE. THANK YOU. AND JUST

01:15:26.421 --> 01:15:29.324
WANT TO, AGAIN, ECHO MY

01:15:29.391 --> 01:15:30.659
APPRECIATION OF THE SENATOR'S

01:15:30.726 --> 01:15:31.660
ENGAGEMENT, CONSIDERING THE

01:15:31.727 --> 01:15:33.495
SHORT WINDOW WE'VE HAD WITH

01:15:33.562 --> 01:15:35.397
THESE NEW DEVELOPMENTS, ARE

01:15:35.464 --> 01:15:37.332
THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM

01:15:37.399 --> 01:15:40.068
COMMITTEE MEMBERS?

01:15:40.135 --> 01:15:44.373
ASSEMBLYMEMBER CROW? THANKS SO

01:15:44.439 --> 01:15:45.474
MUCH, SENATOR, FOR BRINGING THIS

01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:48.010
BILL FORWARD. IN MY FORMER LIFE.

01:15:48.076 --> 01:15:49.745
I PROSECUTED SOME ELDER

01:15:49.811 --> 01:15:51.847
FINANCIAL ABUSE CASES, INCLUDING

01:15:51.914 --> 01:15:53.282
THE TYPES OF SCAMS WE'RE TALKING

01:15:53.348 --> 01:15:54.917
ABOUT HERE AND THE KIND YOU

01:15:54.983 --> 01:15:57.653
BROUGHT UP WITH MR. LOPEZ. SO I

01:15:57.719 --> 01:15:58.420
APPRECIATE THIS, BILL. I THINK

01:15:58.487 --> 01:16:00.188
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. I SHARE

01:16:00.255 --> 01:16:02.391
SOME OF ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHEN'S

01:16:02.457 --> 01:16:04.493
CONCERNS ABOUT IT, CASTING A

01:16:04.559 --> 01:16:06.161
LITTLE BIT TOO BROAD OF A NET IN

01:16:06.228 --> 01:16:10.198
TERMS OF POTENTIALLY INHIBITING

01:16:10.265 --> 01:16:11.400
LENDERS LIKE WELLS FARGO AND

01:16:11.466 --> 01:16:13.235
THEIR PRODUCT FROM ASSISTING

01:16:13.302 --> 01:16:15.971
SMALL BUSINESSES. WELLS FARGO

01:16:16.038 --> 01:16:19.374
SHOWED ME A LIST OF AT LEAST 25

01:16:19.441 --> 01:16:20.342
BUSINESSES IN MY DISTRICT IN

01:16:20.409 --> 01:16:21.610
SACRAMENTO. HERE IN ASSEMBLY

01:16:21.677 --> 01:16:24.279
DISTRICT SIX, THAT WOULD BE

01:16:24.346 --> 01:16:26.081
IMPACTED AND POTENTIALLY, YOU

01:16:26.148 --> 01:16:27.749
KNOW, WOULD DRIVE THAT PRODUCT

01:16:27.816 --> 01:16:29.518
OUT OF THE MARKET, WHICH IN TURN

01:16:29.584 --> 01:16:32.287
WOULD COST THOSE BUSINESSES

01:16:32.354 --> 01:16:34.790
POTENTIALLY A LOT HIGHER APR.

01:16:34.856 --> 01:16:36.525
AND THAT COST WOULD PROBABLY GO

01:16:36.591 --> 01:16:38.327
TO CONSUMERS. SO THAT'S WHERE MY

01:16:38.393 --> 01:16:39.728
CONCERN IS COMING FROM. I PLAN

01:16:39.795 --> 01:16:41.096
TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. I

01:16:41.163 --> 01:16:42.197
REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING

01:16:42.264 --> 01:16:44.466
IT FORWARD AND ALL OF THE WORK

01:16:44.533 --> 01:16:45.233
YOU'VE ALREADY DONE TO REMOVE SO

01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:47.769
MUCH OPPOSITION. I THINK

01:16:47.836 --> 01:16:50.405
SPECIFICALLY WHAT WE COULD DO TO

01:16:50.472 --> 01:16:52.074
MAKE IT MORE CLEAR. AND I THINK

01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:52.874
ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHEN BROUGHT UP

01:16:52.941 --> 01:16:54.910
THIS POINT ABOUT THE DOOR TO

01:16:54.977 --> 01:16:57.079
DOOR LOANS, AND THAT DOES SEEM

01:16:57.145 --> 01:16:58.580
TO BE A REAL RED FLAG FOR THE

01:16:58.647 --> 01:16:59.982
TYPE OF PREDATORY LENDING WE'RE

01:17:00.048 --> 01:17:02.884
SEEING. SO IF WE SAID THAT IF WE

01:17:02.951 --> 01:17:05.320
EXEMPTED VENDORS WHOSE MARKETING

01:17:05.387 --> 01:17:08.590
IS NOT PRIMARILY DOOR TO DOOR,

01:17:08.657 --> 01:17:11.393
AND IF WE ADDED IN MULTI-PURPOSE

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:13.228
LOAN PRODUCTS, NOT JUST HOME

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:15.597
IMPROVEMENT LOAN PRODUCTS, AND

01:17:15.664 --> 01:17:16.965
THEN ALSO THE DEALER FEE, WHICH

01:17:17.032 --> 01:17:19.001
YOU ADDRESS. SO I THINK THAT

01:17:19.067 --> 01:17:21.203
WOULD HELP MAKE IT CLEAR WHO

01:17:21.269 --> 01:17:22.604
WE'RE TARGETING WITH THIS BILL,

01:17:22.671 --> 01:17:25.607
THE BAD ACTORS. BUT THEN, YOU

01:17:25.674 --> 01:17:27.342
KNOW, KIND OF MAKE SURE THAT

01:17:27.409 --> 01:17:29.578
WE'RE NOT INADVERTENTLY CASTING

01:17:29.644 --> 01:17:32.647
TOO WIDE A NET. DOES THAT SOUND

01:17:32.714 --> 01:17:34.149
LIKE SOMETHING THAT WOULD WORK?

01:17:34.216 --> 01:17:36.284
OKAY. THANK YOU. THANKS,

01:17:36.351 --> 01:17:38.420
SENATOR. HI. YEAH, I CAN,

01:17:38.487 --> 01:17:40.389
BECAUSE. YEAH. AND WE HAVE

01:17:40.455 --> 01:17:42.491
RECENTLY SEEN SEEN, YOU KNOW,

01:17:42.557 --> 01:17:43.925
THOSE PROPOSALS FROM THE

01:17:43.992 --> 01:17:45.360
OPPOSITION. AND SO AGAIN, WE

01:17:45.427 --> 01:17:47.262
JUST WANT TO BE REALLY CAREFUL.

01:17:47.329 --> 01:17:48.296
I'M SORRY I'M TALKING TO YOU,

01:17:48.363 --> 01:17:51.500
BUT I'M NOT FACING YOU. SO I

01:17:51.566 --> 01:17:52.768
THINK LIKE ONE OF SOME THINGS

01:17:52.834 --> 01:17:54.269
THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT.

01:17:54.336 --> 01:17:55.771
RIGHT. THE LIKE DOOR TO DOOR

01:17:55.837 --> 01:17:58.040
SALES, EVEN IF IT'S NOT YOUR

01:17:58.106 --> 01:17:58.707
PRIMARY PRACTICE. RIGHT. A DOOR

01:17:58.774 --> 01:18:00.575
TO DOOR SALE UNDER FEDERAL LAW

01:18:00.642 --> 01:18:02.244
AND MOST STATE LAW. RIGHT.

01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:04.646
PEOPLE HAVE REALIZED IT'S A HIGH

01:18:04.713 --> 01:18:05.947
PRESSURE SITUATION. AND SO EVEN

01:18:06.014 --> 01:18:07.716
IF YOU DON'T DO IT EVERY DAY,

01:18:07.783 --> 01:18:09.117
SHOULDN'T THOSE PEOPLE WHO YOU

01:18:09.184 --> 01:18:10.986
DO COME TO THEIR DOOR BE

01:18:11.053 --> 01:18:12.254
PROTECTED? IS ONE THING WE'RE

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:13.688
THINKING ABOUT, AND THEN ANOTHER

01:18:13.755 --> 01:18:15.924
WITH THE MULTI-PURPOSE LOAN.

01:18:15.991 --> 01:18:16.992
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE THINKING

01:18:17.059 --> 01:18:18.460
ABOUT IS WE DON'T WANT THE

01:18:18.527 --> 01:18:19.795
LENDERS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:18:19.861 --> 01:18:21.396
REGULATE TO THROW IN SOMETHING,

01:18:21.463 --> 01:18:22.864
RIGHT. THROW IN A NON HOME

01:18:22.931 --> 01:18:24.599
IMPROVEMENT PRODUCT TO TRY TO

01:18:24.666 --> 01:18:27.169
EVADE REGULATION. BUT SO AND

01:18:27.235 --> 01:18:29.704
THIS IS AGAIN IT'S DIFFICULT. WE

01:18:29.771 --> 01:18:31.239
THINK WE CAN GET IT RIGHT. YOU

01:18:31.306 --> 01:18:33.809
KNOW WHAT I MEAN. WE JUST WANT

01:18:33.875 --> 01:18:35.110
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALSO NOT

01:18:35.177 --> 01:18:36.878
LEAVING ANY CONSUMERS BEHIND.

01:18:36.945 --> 01:18:38.580
THANK YOU. ONE OTHER FOLLOW UP

01:18:38.647 --> 01:18:41.883
QUESTION WHETHER THE APPLICATION

01:18:41.950 --> 01:18:43.318
THAT THE APPLICATION HAS TO

01:18:43.385 --> 01:18:45.487
HAPPEN MANUALLY, WHAT IF THE

01:18:45.554 --> 01:18:46.455
APPLICATION HAPPENS ON THE

01:18:46.521 --> 01:18:49.424
CONSUMER'S OWN DEVICE. THEY THEY

01:18:49.491 --> 01:18:51.126
THEY EFFECTUATE THE LOAN

01:18:51.193 --> 01:18:55.831
THEMSELVES ON THEIR OWN DEVICE.

01:18:55.897 --> 01:18:58.767
OKAY. THANKS. UNFORTUNATELY WE

01:18:58.834 --> 01:19:00.869
AGAIN WE DO SEE A LOT OF FRAUD

01:19:00.936 --> 01:19:02.704
HAPPENING ON THE HOMEOWNERS

01:19:02.771 --> 01:19:03.772
DEVICES. SO IT CAN TAKE

01:19:03.839 --> 01:19:06.374
DIFFERENT FORMS. SOMETIMES IT'S

01:19:06.441 --> 01:19:08.110
BECAUSE THE SALESPERSON OR

01:19:08.176 --> 01:19:10.245
WHOEVER IS SELLING THE LOAN DOES

01:19:10.312 --> 01:19:11.713
RIGHT. THEY ACTUALLY TAP THROUGH

01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:13.515
ON THE HOMEOWNER'S PHONE OR

01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:15.317
TABLET OR SOMETHING. OTHER TIMES

01:19:15.383 --> 01:19:17.886
THEY'RE JUST, YOU KNOW, THE

01:19:17.953 --> 01:19:18.987
HOMEOWNER IS TAPPING THROUGH,

01:19:19.054 --> 01:19:20.088
BUT THEY'RE BEING LIED TO ABOUT

01:19:20.155 --> 01:19:22.657
WHAT IT IS. AND SO WE HAVE A LOT

01:19:22.724 --> 01:19:25.060
OF CLIENTS WHO SAY WE CAN'T READ

01:19:25.127 --> 01:19:25.927
THAT, CAN WE GET A HARD COPY?

01:19:25.994 --> 01:19:27.863
AND THE ANSWER IS NO, YOU KNOW,

01:19:27.929 --> 01:19:30.031
THINGS LIKE THAT. AND SO I THINK

01:19:30.098 --> 01:19:31.199
AND I THINK THAT SOMETHING THAT

01:19:31.266 --> 01:19:32.567
THE OPPOSITION IS PROPOSING THAT

01:19:32.634 --> 01:19:34.836
I THINK MAKES A LOT OF SENSE, IS

01:19:34.903 --> 01:19:36.004
TRYING TO DO AN AMALGAMATION OF

01:19:36.071 --> 01:19:37.072
THESE THINGS. RIGHT. BECAUSE ONE

01:19:37.139 --> 01:19:39.374
OF THESE THINGS ONLY IS NOT

01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:40.375
GOING TO PROTECT THE CONSUMERS,

01:19:40.442 --> 01:19:41.576
RIGHT, WHO GET DEFRAUDED USING

01:19:41.643 --> 01:19:43.478
THEIR OWN PHONES OR, OR THINGS

01:19:43.545 --> 01:19:45.614
LIKE THAT. BUT SO, SO YEAH,

01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:46.281
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT

01:19:46.348 --> 01:19:49.284
ON THAT. BUT WE DO THINK IT'S

01:19:49.351 --> 01:19:51.153
GOING TO BE A PART OF A, A PART

01:19:51.219 --> 01:19:52.387
OF A, A LARGER, MORE ELEGANT

01:19:52.454 --> 01:19:53.288
SOLUTION, RIGHT, TO MAKE SURE

01:19:53.355 --> 01:19:55.056
THAT WE'RE NOT LEAVING ANYONE

01:19:55.123 --> 01:19:56.525
BEHIND. GREAT. THANK YOU SO

01:19:56.591 --> 01:19:59.561
MUCH. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:19:59.628 --> 01:20:02.130
KRELL. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. SAWYER

01:20:02.197 --> 01:20:03.732
QUESTIONS? YEAH. I JUST WANT TO

01:20:03.798 --> 01:20:05.066
MAKE A COMMENT BECAUSE I THINK

01:20:05.133 --> 01:20:07.769
MY QUESTION ALSO WAS ANSWERED,

01:20:07.836 --> 01:20:09.671
PARTICULARLY IN THE INTRODUCTORY

01:20:09.738 --> 01:20:11.206
OR THE REMARKS THAT YOU MADE.

01:20:11.273 --> 01:20:12.140
SENATOR, I JUST WANT TO THANK

01:20:12.207 --> 01:20:14.409
YOU AGAIN FOR BRINGING THIS BILL

01:20:14.476 --> 01:20:15.777
FORWARD. I THINK THE INTENT IS

01:20:15.844 --> 01:20:18.280
EXACTLY WHAT WE SHOULD ALL BE

01:20:18.346 --> 01:20:19.848
SUPPORTING, BECAUSE I KNOW IN

01:20:19.915 --> 01:20:21.983
PARTICULAR, IN MY DISTRICT,

01:20:22.050 --> 01:20:24.052
SOLAR IS A BIG ISSUE AND FOLKS

01:20:24.119 --> 01:20:25.921
HAVE BEEN DEFRAUDED AT THE DOOR.

01:20:25.987 --> 01:20:27.355
I'VE HEARD COUNTLESS STORIES

01:20:27.422 --> 01:20:29.858
LIKE THE MR. LOPEZ STORY. SO

01:20:29.925 --> 01:20:31.126
ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO PROTECT,

01:20:31.193 --> 01:20:33.962
BUT I DO. I AM SENSITIVE TO SOME

01:20:34.029 --> 01:20:36.598
OF THE, THE, THE CONCERNS RAISED

01:20:36.665 --> 01:20:38.200
BY THE OPPOSITION, WHICH I TRUST

01:20:38.266 --> 01:20:39.868
IN. YOU KNOW, YOUR YOUR

01:20:39.935 --> 01:20:41.570
INTRODUCTORY REMARKS, YOU MADE

01:20:41.636 --> 01:20:42.871
SERIOUS COMMITMENT TO ENSURE AND

01:20:42.938 --> 01:20:44.239
THAT YOU'VE ALREADY DEMONSTRATED

01:20:44.306 --> 01:20:46.741

CONCERNS, GETTING EVEN THE SOLAR

01:20:51.146 --> 01:20:52.914
INDUSTRY TO A NEUTRAL POSITION.

01:20:52.981 --> 01:20:55.016
SO AGAIN, THANK YOU FOR BRINGING

01:20:55.083 --> 01:20:57.552

01:25:59.354 --> 01:26:00.889
BIT ABOUT THE LEGAL BACKGROUND,

01:26:00.955 --> 01:26:02.090
AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE FURTHER

01:26:02.156 --> 01:26:04.492
QUESTIONS. CURRENTLY, THE DFP

01:26:04.559 --> 01:26:05.860
ADMINISTERS LICENSING STATUTES

01:26:05.927 --> 01:26:07.729
FOR A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES.

01:26:07.795 --> 01:26:09.597
THOSE LICENSING SCHEMES ARE

01:26:09.664 --> 01:26:11.332
PRINCIPALLY FOCUSED ON HOW THOSE

01:26:11.399 --> 01:26:12.967
BUSINESSES ARE SET UP, NOT ON

01:26:13.034 --> 01:26:14.335
HOW THEY INTERACT WITH

01:26:14.402 --> 01:26:16.337
CONSUMERS. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, THE

01:26:16.404 --> 01:26:17.872
MAJOR COMPONENTS OF THE

01:26:17.939 --> 01:26:19.240
LICENSING SCHEMES INCLUDE

01:26:19.307 --> 01:26:21.142
NEEDING TO GET A LICENSE IN THE

01:26:21.209 --> 01:26:23.344
FIRST PLACE, POSTING A BOND, NOT

01:26:23.411 --> 01:26:24.679
HAVING LEADERS OF THE COMPANY BE

01:26:24.746 --> 01:26:26.781
CONVICTED OF CERTAIN FELONIES,

01:26:26.848 --> 01:26:29.050
AND RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENTS.

01:26:29.117 --> 01:26:30.852
THOSE LICENSING SCHEMES DO NOT

01:26:30.919 --> 01:26:32.253
CONTAIN PROHIBITIONS ON TAKING

01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:34.055
UNFAIR ADVANTAGE OF CALIFORNIA

01:26:34.122 --> 01:26:36.157
CONSUMERS. TO USE AN ANALOGY

01:26:36.224 --> 01:26:38.426
FROM ROAD SAFETY, THE EXISTING

01:26:38.493 --> 01:26:40.161
AUTHORITY OVER LICENSEES IS SORT

01:26:40.228 --> 01:26:42.230
OF LIKE THE RULES AROUND WEARING

01:26:42.297 --> 01:26:43.398
A SEAT BELT OR HAVING WORKING

01:26:43.464 --> 01:26:45.500
WINDSHIELD WIPERS. SB 825 WILL

01:26:45.567 --> 01:26:48.503
ALLOW THE DFP TO SAY TO A

01:26:48.570 --> 01:26:49.971
LICENSEE, HEY, STOP! YOU ARE

01:26:50.038 --> 01:26:51.839
DRIVING IN A DANGEROUS MANNER

01:26:51.906 --> 01:26:53.308
THAT IS INJURING CONSUMERS TO

01:26:53.374 --> 01:26:54.943
PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM DANGEROUS

01:26:55.009 --> 01:26:56.978
FINANCIAL ACTORS, TODAY, DFP

01:26:57.045 --> 01:26:58.580
MUST USE A CONVOLUTED PROCEDURE

01:26:58.646 --> 01:27:00.682
UNDER FEDERAL LAW, BUT

01:27:00.748 --> 01:27:01.983
CALIFORNIA SHOULD HAVE THAT

01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:03.184
AUTHORITY OVER LICENSEES

01:27:03.251 --> 01:27:05.019
DIRECTLY UNDER STATE LAW,

01:27:05.086 --> 01:27:06.120
ESPECIALLY WITH THE FEDERAL

01:27:06.187 --> 01:27:08.523
FINANCIAL REGULATOR, THE CFPB.

01:27:08.590 --> 01:27:10.725
ESSENTIALLY A NONFUNCTIONING

01:27:10.792 --> 01:27:12.927
AGENCY. IN FACT, THE CFPB HAS

01:27:12.994 --> 01:27:14.662
SAID IN NEW GUIDANCE THAT STATES

01:27:14.729 --> 01:27:15.830
SHOULD TAKE THE LEAD IN

01:27:15.897 --> 01:27:17.265
REGULATING THEIR OWN LICENSED

01:27:17.332 --> 01:27:19.801
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. SB 825

01:27:19.867 --> 01:27:21.336
IS ENTIRELY CONSISTENT WITH

01:27:21.402 --> 01:27:23.838
THAT. WHETHER CALIFORNIA CAN

01:27:23.905 --> 01:27:25.406
PROTECT ITS OWN CONSUMERS FROM

01:27:25.473 --> 01:27:27.175
FINANCIAL HARM SHOULD NOT DEPEND

01:27:27.241 --> 01:27:28.810
ON POLITICAL MACHINATIONS IN

01:27:28.876 --> 01:27:30.511
WASHINGTON, THIS BILL DOES NOT

01:27:30.578 --> 01:27:32.313
EXPAND LIABILITY OR IMPOSE NEW

01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:34.816
LEGAL OBLIGATIONS ON LICENSEES.

01:27:34.882 --> 01:27:36.284
INSTEAD, IT SIMPLY PROVIDES THAT

01:27:36.351 --> 01:27:38.519
IF THE DFP BELIEVES A LEGAL

01:27:38.586 --> 01:27:39.654
VIOLATION HAS OCCURRED, THE

01:27:39.721 --> 01:27:41.422
STATE CAN TAKE ITS OWN ACTIONS

01:27:41.489 --> 01:27:43.057
TO TRY TO PROVE THAT VIOLATION

01:27:43.124 --> 01:27:45.994
TO PROTECT CONSUMERS. I URGE YOU

01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:48.096
TO SUPPORT SB 825 AND I'M HAPPY

01:27:48.162 --> 01:27:50.331
TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK

01:27:50.398 --> 01:27:51.733

HAS REALLY HIT ALL OF THE MAJOR

01:28:01.209 --> 01:28:02.110
BULLET POINTS. I THINK THE ONLY

01:28:02.176 --> 01:28:03.611
THING THAT I'LL ADD, OTHER THAN

01:28:03.678 --> 01:28:04.779
ONE. YOUR ANALYSIS IS REALLY

01:28:04.846 --> 01:28:06.614
SUPERB. CONGRATULATIONS TO

01:28:06.681 --> 01:28:08.683
COMMITTEE STAFF. AND I KNOW

01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:10.752
THANK YOU. AND THEN THE SECOND

01:28:10.818 --> 01:28:14.422
IS THAT UNDER CURRENT LAW, THE

01:28:14.489 --> 01:28:16.891
LEGAL TERMS UNFAIR, DECEPTIVE

01:28:16.958 --> 01:28:19.527
AND ABUSIVE ARE SPECIFICALLY

01:28:19.594 --> 01:28:21.329
CODIFIED TO CURRENT LAW. THESE

01:28:21.396 --> 01:28:23.064
ARE LONG STANDING AUTHORITIES

01:28:23.131 --> 01:28:26.000
THAT EVERY LICENSEE HAS LONG

01:28:26.067 --> 01:28:28.102
BEEN SUBJECT TO. SO WITH THAT,

01:28:28.169 --> 01:28:28.903
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE

01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:30.171

01:28:30.238 --> 01:28:31.773
QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE.

01:28:31.839 --> 01:28:33.207
WONDERFUL. THANK YOU. ANY

RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION. IN 2020,

01:29:56.491 --> 01:29:58.192
WE AFFIRMED THE DFP

01:29:58.259 --> 01:29:59.227
COMMISSIONER'S ABILITY TO BRING

01:29:59.293 --> 01:30:01.629
A CLAIM AGAINST STATE LICENSEES

01:30:01.696 --> 01:30:02.797
BY AMENDING FINANCIAL CODE

01:30:02.864 --> 01:30:05.333
SECTION 326, IN COMPLIANCE WITH

01:30:05.399 --> 01:30:06.868
FEDERAL LAW. THAT SECTION

01:30:06.934 --> 01:30:09.504
REQUIRES DFP TO PROVIDE NOTICE

01:30:09.570 --> 01:30:11.773
TO THE CFPB. THE COMMITTEE

01:30:11.839 --> 01:30:12.707
ANALYSIS, WHICH HAS BEEN

01:30:12.774 --> 01:30:13.541
RECOGNIZED AS BEING WELL

01:30:13.608 --> 01:30:15.810
DRAFTED, RECOGNIZES THAT THIS

01:30:15.877 --> 01:30:17.879
NOTICE IS INTENDED TO HELP

01:30:17.945 --> 01:30:18.412
COORDINATE AND STREAMLINE

01:30:18.479 --> 01:30:19.881
ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS INVOLVING

01:30:19.947 --> 01:30:22.617
MULTIPLE ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.

01:30:22.683 --> 01:30:24.152
SINCE BANKS ARE SUBJECT TO

01:30:24.218 --> 01:30:25.553
MULTIPLE REGULATORS, INCLUDING

01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:27.655
FEDERAL REGULATORS REQUIRING

01:30:27.722 --> 01:30:29.824
NOTICE BY THE STATE WHEN THE

01:30:29.891 --> 01:30:30.691
STATE IS PURSUING ENFORCEMENT OF

01:30:30.758 --> 01:30:32.560
A FEDERAL LAW, AND THE POTENTIAL

01:30:32.627 --> 01:30:34.462
THAT THESE BANKING REGULATORS

01:30:34.529 --> 01:30:36.264
MAY COORDINATE ON ENFORCEMENT

01:30:36.330 --> 01:30:38.199
MATTERS IS SENSIBLE POLICY.

01:30:38.266 --> 01:30:40.635
SENATE BILL 825 SIDESTEPS THIS

01:30:40.701 --> 01:30:43.171
IMPORTANT FEDERAL LAW PROCESS.

01:30:43.237 --> 01:30:44.438
HOWEVER, SETTING ASIDE THE

01:30:44.505 --> 01:30:45.606
IMPORTANT CONCEPT OF

01:30:45.673 --> 01:30:47.375
COORDINATION BETWEEN ENFORCEMENT

01:30:47.441 --> 01:30:49.544
AGENCIES GIVEN RECENT CONCERNS

01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:51.445
EXPRESSED BY PROPONENTS, WE

01:30:51.512 --> 01:30:53.614
OFFERED A SECOND PATHWAY WHERE

01:30:53.681 --> 01:30:55.716
NOTICE TO THE CFPB WOULD NOT BE

01:30:55.783 --> 01:30:56.984
REQUIRED. BUT THOSE AMENDMENTS

01:30:57.051 --> 01:30:58.219
HAVE UNFORTUNATELY BEEN

01:30:58.286 --> 01:30:59.987
DECLINED. A FEW CLOSING

01:31:00.054 --> 01:31:01.289
THOUGHTS. WE AREN'T CONVINCED

01:31:01.355 --> 01:31:03.758
THAT DFP LACKS TOOLS TO MAKE

01:31:03.825 --> 01:31:05.126
MEANINGFUL ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS

01:31:05.193 --> 01:31:07.228
AGAINST BANKS. AS A MATTER OF

01:31:07.295 --> 01:31:08.729
FACT, THERE ARE SEVERAL

01:31:08.796 --> 01:31:09.697
PROVISIONS IN THE FINANCIAL CODE

01:31:09.764 --> 01:31:11.332
THAT ALLOW FOR A CEASE AND

01:31:11.399 --> 01:31:13.301
DESIST ORDERS. CIVIL MONETARY

01:31:13.367 --> 01:31:15.570
PENALTIES, THE REMOVAL OF

01:31:15.636 --> 01:31:17.104
INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK FOR

01:31:17.171 --> 01:31:18.539
INSTITUTIONS, AND THE SUSPENSION

01:31:18.606 --> 01:31:22.076
OR REVOCATION OF A CHARTER. THIS

01:31:22.143 --> 01:31:23.177
MEASURE CREATES A PERMANENT

01:31:23.244 --> 01:31:24.912
CHANGE IN LAW, GIVEN CONCERNS

01:31:24.979 --> 01:31:26.681
THAT MAY ONLY EXIST WITH A

01:31:26.747 --> 01:31:28.249
PARTICULAR ADMINISTRATION. IN

01:31:28.316 --> 01:31:29.650
OTHER WORDS, THERE'S NO SUNSET

01:31:29.717 --> 01:31:31.752
IN THIS MEASURE. FINALLY, THIS

01:31:31.819 --> 01:31:33.354
MEASURE HURTS STATE CHARTERED

01:31:33.421 --> 01:31:34.355
COMMUNITY BANKS WHO ARE TRYING

01:31:34.422 --> 01:31:35.990
TO SERVE THEIR COMMUNITIES FOR

01:31:36.057 --> 01:31:38.492
THE REASONS MENTIONED. WE MUST

01:31:38.559 --> 01:31:39.727
OPPOSE THE MEASURE AND

01:31:39.794 --> 01:31:41.095
RESPECTFULLY URGE A NO VOTE.

01:31:41.162 --> 01:31:43.598
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. MEMBERS.

01:31:43.664 --> 01:31:44.966
INDIRA MCDONALD, ON BEHALF OF

01:31:45.032 --> 01:31:46.834

01:31:46.901 --> 01:31:47.902
ASSOCIATION, RESPECTFULLY

01:31:47.969 --> 01:31:49.237
OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED. WE

01:31:49.303 --> 01:31:50.571
APPRECIATE THE DIALOG WITH THE

01:31:50.638 --> 01:31:52.974
AUTHOR AND STAFF. AS ENACTED IN

01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:54.442
2020, THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL

01:31:54.508 --> 01:31:56.277
PROTECTION LAW EXEMPTS FROM ITS

01:31:56.344 --> 01:31:58.012
SCOPE THOSE LICENSED BY THE

01:31:58.079 --> 01:31:59.180
DEPARTMENT OR REGISTERED BY

01:31:59.247 --> 01:32:01.349
OTHER STATE OR FEDERAL AGENCIES.

01:32:01.415 --> 01:32:02.617
THE EXEMPTION WAS PROVIDED

01:32:02.683 --> 01:32:03.751
BECAUSE THE NEW PROGRAM WAS

01:32:03.818 --> 01:32:05.519
INTENDED TO TARGET NEW EMERGING

01:32:05.586 --> 01:32:07.421
FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICE

01:32:07.488 --> 01:32:08.155
PROVIDERS ENTERING THE

01:32:08.222 --> 01:32:09.991
CALIFORNIA MARKETPLACE THAT WERE

01:32:10.057 --> 01:32:10.992
NOT REGULATED UNDER THE

01:32:11.058 --> 01:32:12.727
DEPARTMENT'S EXISTING FINANCE

01:32:12.793 --> 01:32:15.663
LICENSING LAWS. SB 825 WOULD

01:32:15.730 --> 01:32:17.431
REPEAL THE EXEMPTION AND EXPAND

01:32:17.498 --> 01:32:18.099
THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL

01:32:18.165 --> 01:32:19.300
PROTECTION LAW AND THE

01:32:19.367 --> 01:32:20.768
DEPARTMENT'S AUTHORITY BY MAKING

01:32:20.835 --> 01:32:22.069
THE DEPARTMENT'S LICENSEES

01:32:22.136 --> 01:32:23.571
SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL PENALTIES

01:32:23.638 --> 01:32:25.840
AND SANCTIONS TARGETING UNFAIR

01:32:25.907 --> 01:32:28.542
OR DECEPTIVE ACTS OR PRACTICES.

01:32:28.609 --> 01:32:30.378
THE PROPOSED NEW ENFORCEMENT

01:32:30.444 --> 01:32:32.213
AUTHORITY IS REDUNDANT ABOUT THE

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:33.381
EXISTING AUTHORITY OF THE

01:32:33.447 --> 01:32:34.782
ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE

01:32:34.849 --> 01:32:35.917
DEPARTMENT'S OWN ENFORCEMENT

01:32:35.983 --> 01:32:37.285
POWERS WITH RESPECT TO

01:32:37.351 --> 01:32:39.020
LICENSEES. THIS IS WHY EXISTING

01:32:39.086 --> 01:32:40.788
LICENSEES WERE ORIGINALLY

01:32:40.855 --> 01:32:42.256
EXEMPTED. IN AN EFFORT TO

01:32:42.323 --> 01:32:43.491
COMPROMISE, WE HAVE PROPOSED

01:32:43.557 --> 01:32:44.492
AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD PROVIDE

01:32:44.558 --> 01:32:46.661
NEW AUTHORITY TO THE DFP TO

01:32:46.727 --> 01:32:48.863
IMPOSE THE SAME REMEDIES AS THEY

01:32:48.930 --> 01:32:50.231
COULD GET TODAY IF THEY GO TO

01:32:50.298 --> 01:32:51.966
COURT UNDER DODD-FRANK. BUT IF

01:32:52.033 --> 01:32:53.501
THEY ASSERT THROUGH AN

01:32:53.567 --> 01:32:54.535
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING,

01:32:54.602 --> 01:32:55.970
REMEDIES WOULD BE LIMITED TO

01:32:56.037 --> 01:32:58.339
EXISTING ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

01:32:58.406 --> 01:33:02.143
FOR THAT LICENSE. LICENSING LAW,

01:33:02.209 --> 01:33:03.611

PROCEEDING PROCEEDING AGAINST A

01:33:05.379 --> 01:33:06.781
MORTGAGE BANK, THE DFP WOULD

01:33:06.847 --> 01:33:08.115
APPLY THE REMEDIES UNDER THE

01:34:06.173 --> 01:34:11.145
QUESTIONS BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS?

01:34:11.212 --> 01:34:15.516
ASSEMBLY MEMBER KRULL. HI,

SENATOR, THANKS SO MUCH FOR

01:34:16.984 --> 01:34:18.486
BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. I'VE

01:34:18.552 --> 01:34:20.554
BEEN JUST KIND OF PLAYING CATCH

01:34:20.621 --> 01:34:23.024
UP ON A LOT OF THESE ISSUES AND

01:34:23.090 --> 01:34:25.926
HOW KIND OF THE FRAMEWORK THAT'S

01:34:25.993 --> 01:34:29.163
BEEN CREATED IN THIS SPACE, THE

01:34:29.230 --> 01:34:30.865
KIND OF CHANGE IN FEDERAL LAW AS

01:34:30.931 --> 01:34:33.768
OF APRIL AND HOW WE'RE

01:34:33.834 --> 01:34:37.171
ATTEMPTING TO STEP IN BASED ON

01:34:37.238 --> 01:34:38.606
THAT. AND I'M JUST WONDERING IF

01:34:38.672 --> 01:34:41.075
YOU COULD MAYBE SPEAK TO THE

01:34:41.142 --> 01:34:41.675
OPPOSITION A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

01:34:41.742 --> 01:34:43.210
WHY CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT

01:34:43.277 --> 01:34:45.546
FRAMEWORK IS INSUFFICIENT TO

01:34:45.613 --> 01:34:46.847
ADDRESS THE KIND OF CONCERNS

01:34:46.914 --> 01:34:48.282
WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS. WHEN

01:34:48.349 --> 01:34:49.350
YOU COMBINE THE LICENSING

01:34:49.417 --> 01:34:50.084
AUTHORITY THAT WE'VE TALKED

01:34:50.151 --> 01:34:52.253
ABOUT A LITTLE BIT, BUT ALSO THE

01:34:52.319 --> 01:34:53.954
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S AUTHORITY IN

01:34:54.021 --> 01:34:56.891
THIS SPACE AND JUST BASIC UNFAIR

01:34:56.957 --> 01:34:58.859
BUSINESS PRACTICES. THANK YOU.

01:34:58.926 --> 01:35:00.594
SO I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO PASS IT

01:35:00.661 --> 01:35:02.363
TO ANDREW TO JUST GIVE A LITTLE

01:35:02.430 --> 01:35:04.565
BIT OF DETAILS ABOUT THAT. YEAH.

01:35:04.632 --> 01:35:05.199
THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER. HAPPY

01:35:05.266 --> 01:35:07.701
TO TAKE THAT. SO I HAVE A COUPLE

01:35:07.768 --> 01:35:09.236
OF THOUGHTS I THINK I THINK

01:35:09.303 --> 01:35:10.771
FIRST OF ALL, YOU KNOW, WE'VE

01:35:10.838 --> 01:35:12.039
TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW

01:35:12.106 --> 01:35:14.575
THE CURRENT REGIME VIS A VIS THE

01:35:14.642 --> 01:35:16.410
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REQUIRES

01:35:16.477 --> 01:35:17.812
NOTICE TO THE CFPB. IT'S

01:35:17.878 --> 01:35:20.047
ACTUALLY QUITE A BIT MORE THAN

01:35:20.114 --> 01:35:22.516
NOTICE. SO IF A LAWSUIT UNDER

01:35:22.583 --> 01:35:24.251
THESE UDAP AUTHORITIES IS FILED

01:35:24.318 --> 01:35:26.554
UNDER FEDERAL LAW, THE FEDERAL

01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:27.688
CFPB HAS THE AUTHORITY TO

01:35:27.755 --> 01:35:29.090
ACTUALLY INTERVENE IN THAT

01:35:29.156 --> 01:35:30.291
LAWSUIT AND PARTICIPATE IN THE

01:35:30.357 --> 01:35:32.560
LAWSUIT. I THINK WHAT'S CHANGED

01:35:32.626 --> 01:35:33.494
IN THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS AT

01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:36.030
THE FEDERAL LEVEL HAS REALLY

01:35:36.097 --> 01:35:37.298
GIVES US, IN THE CONSUMER

01:35:37.364 --> 01:35:39.100
PROTECTION WORLD, A LOT OF

01:35:39.166 --> 01:35:40.835
PAUSE. YOU KNOW, THE CFPB HAS

01:35:40.901 --> 01:35:43.337
BASICALLY DISMISSED ALL PENDING

01:35:43.404 --> 01:35:44.572
CLAIMS, YOU KNOW, ACROSS THE

01:35:44.638 --> 01:35:46.874
BOARD, INCLUDING CLAIMS THAT

01:35:46.941 --> 01:35:47.875
EXISTED AND WERE INITIATED

01:35:47.942 --> 01:35:49.910
DURING THE FIRST TRUMP

01:35:49.977 --> 01:35:51.979
ADMINISTRATION. SO LIKE THERE SO

01:35:52.046 --> 01:35:54.248
AN ENTITY LIKE THAT HAVING THE

01:35:54.315 --> 01:35:55.449
ABILITY TO REALLY INTERVENE IN

01:35:55.516 --> 01:35:58.586
THE LAWSUIT AND PARTICIPATE IS A

01:35:58.652 --> 01:35:59.920
SCARY THOUGHT. I THINK IF

01:35:59.987 --> 01:36:01.722
CALIFORNIA IS TRYING TO PROTECT

01:36:01.789 --> 01:36:03.858
ITS CONSUMERS, THE OTHER THING I

01:36:03.924 --> 01:36:07.928
WILL SAY IS THAT THE, THE, THE

01:36:07.995 --> 01:36:09.396
REMEDIES UNDER THE LICENSING

01:36:09.463 --> 01:36:11.732
STATUTES THAT CURRENTLY EXIST

01:36:11.799 --> 01:36:13.601
AND THE PROHIBITIONS UNDER THOSE

01:36:13.667 --> 01:36:15.569
STATUTES, THEY REALLY AREN'T

01:36:15.636 --> 01:36:17.338
AIMED AT PROTECTING CONSUMERS.

01:36:17.404 --> 01:36:18.973
AND SO WHAT YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW

01:36:19.039 --> 01:36:21.208
IS A SITUATION WHERE THE DFP

01:36:21.275 --> 01:36:25.412
CAN, CAN, CAN SUPERVISE AND GO

01:36:25.479 --> 01:36:31.619
AFTER LICENSEES, BUT NOT SORT OF

01:36:31.685 --> 01:36:32.753
FOR TAKING ADVANTAGE OF

01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:34.155
CONSUMERS AND SORT OF THESE

01:36:34.221 --> 01:36:35.923
CUTTING EDGE WAYS. AS AN

01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:38.259
EXAMPLE, ONE OF THE CFPB CASES

01:36:38.325 --> 01:36:40.261
THAT WAS JUST DISMISSED WAS

01:36:40.327 --> 01:36:42.263
AGAINST CAPITAL ONE BANK. THEY,

01:36:42.329 --> 01:36:44.832
YOU KNOW, BASICALLY STEERED

01:36:44.899 --> 01:36:47.168
CONSUMERS INTO A LOW YIELD

01:36:47.234 --> 01:36:48.335
SAVINGS ACCOUNT, SAVINGS ACCOUNT

01:36:48.402 --> 01:36:49.603
THAT DIDN'T GENERATE ANY

01:36:49.670 --> 01:36:51.138
INTEREST AND DIDN'T TELL

01:36:51.205 --> 01:36:52.940
CONSUMERS THAT THEY HAD A MUCH

01:36:53.007 --> 01:36:53.507
BETTER SAVINGS ACCOUNT THAT

01:36:53.574 --> 01:36:54.742
GENERATED HIGH INTEREST, LIKE

01:36:54.808 --> 01:36:56.510
THEY BASICALLY THEY PUSHED

01:36:56.577 --> 01:36:57.845
EVERYONE INTO ONE, STARTED THE

01:36:57.912 --> 01:36:59.346
NEW ACCOUNT AND DIDN'T TELL

01:36:59.413 --> 01:37:00.781
ANYONE ABOUT IT, AND SAVED

01:37:00.848 --> 01:37:02.883
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS DOING THAT.

01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:05.386
THAT'S THE KIND OF LIKE SCHEME

01:37:05.452 --> 01:37:07.321
THAT CURRENTLY UNDER THE

01:37:07.388 --> 01:37:09.723
LICENSING STATUTES, DFP IS

01:37:09.790 --> 01:37:10.891
HAMSTRUNG IN GOING AFTER. AND

01:37:10.958 --> 01:37:12.526
I'M CERTAINLY NOT SUGGESTING

01:37:12.593 --> 01:37:14.895
THAT ANY MEMBER OF ANY OF THE

01:37:14.962 --> 01:37:15.529
ASSOCIATIONS OPPOSED TO THE BILL

01:37:15.596 --> 01:37:17.631
IS ENGAGING IN THAT BEHAVIOR

01:37:17.698 --> 01:37:20.534
TODAY. I'M SAYING THAT GOING

01:37:20.601 --> 01:37:21.702
FORWARD, CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO

01:37:21.769 --> 01:37:24.138
HAVE THE AUTHORITY. YOU KNOW,

01:37:24.205 --> 01:37:26.340
CLEARLY UNDER STATE LAW, WITHOUT

01:37:26.407 --> 01:37:28.509
INTERFERENCE FROM THE FEDS, TO

01:37:28.576 --> 01:37:30.644
GO AFTER A SCHEME LIKE THAT.

01:37:30.711 --> 01:37:31.779
WHAT ABOUT THE ATTORNEY

01:37:31.845 --> 01:37:33.214
GENERAL'S AUTHORITY? THE

01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:34.582
ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS AUTHORITY

01:37:34.648 --> 01:37:36.317
UNDER THE UCL, THE UNFAIR

01:37:36.383 --> 01:37:37.418
COMPETITION LAW. THAT IS TRUE,

01:37:37.484 --> 01:37:39.553
BUT THAT IS THAT IS DISTINCT

01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:42.823
FROM YOU, DAP AUTHORITY. SO DAP

01:37:42.890 --> 01:37:44.658
AUTHORITY, UNFAIR ABUSIVE ACTS

01:37:44.725 --> 01:37:47.595
AND PRACTICES IS SOMETHING THAT

01:37:47.661 --> 01:37:49.430
WAS PUT INTO STATUTE FOR THE

01:37:49.496 --> 01:37:51.465
FIRST TIME IN THE DODD-FRANK ACT

01:37:51.532 --> 01:37:53.667
IN 2010, AND IT REALLY GIVES

01:37:53.734 --> 01:37:56.503
FINANCIAL REGULATORS SPECIFIC

01:37:56.570 --> 01:37:58.806
AUTHORITY TO GO AFTER FINANCIAL

01:37:58.872 --> 01:38:01.308
SCAMS AND SCHEMES. AND SO I

01:38:01.375 --> 01:38:04.778
THINK THE UCL AUTHORITY, WHILE

01:38:04.845 --> 01:38:07.681
HELPFUL, DOESN'T MAP COMPLETELY

01:38:07.748 --> 01:38:09.483
ONTO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN

01:38:09.550 --> 01:38:11.318
THE SAME WAY THAT DAP AUTHORITY

01:38:11.385 --> 01:38:13.087
DOES. AND THAT'S WHY, YOU KNOW,

01:38:13.153 --> 01:38:14.188
THAT'S WHY THE CFPB WAS GIVEN

01:38:14.255 --> 01:38:16.423
THAT AUTHORITY RIGHT AFTER THE

01:38:16.490 --> 01:38:18.492
FINANCIAL MELTDOWN AND WHY WE

01:38:18.559 --> 01:38:20.794
NEED IT HERE UNDER CALIFORNIA

01:38:20.861 --> 01:38:24.999
LAW. GOT IT. THANK YOU. THANK

01:38:25.065 --> 01:38:27.401
YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS?

01:38:27.468 --> 01:38:31.205
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. I WANT TO THANK

01:38:31.272 --> 01:38:33.574
THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS FOR THIS

01:38:33.641 --> 01:38:38.012
BILL. I YOU KNOW, I'M PERSONALLY

01:38:38.078 --> 01:38:39.380
VERY, VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

01:38:39.446 --> 01:38:40.648
WHAT'S HAPPENED AT THE FEDERAL

01:38:40.714 --> 01:38:42.549
LEVEL AND WHAT THIS MEANS FOR

01:38:42.616 --> 01:38:45.819
CONSUMERS. WE PASSED IN THE

01:38:45.886 --> 01:38:47.888
STATE A BILL THAT I CARRIED LAST

01:38:47.955 --> 01:38:51.225
YEAR, CLICK TO CANCEL, WHICH WAS

01:38:51.292 --> 01:38:54.194
SUPPOSED TO ALSO HELP BOLSTER

01:38:54.261 --> 01:38:56.030
THE WORK THAT WAS HAPPENING AT

01:38:56.096 --> 01:38:58.799
THE CFPB AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

01:38:58.866 --> 01:39:02.736
AND SOON AFTER, IT ALL UNRAVELED

01:39:02.803 --> 01:39:05.539
BEFORE OUR EYES. AND, YOU KNOW,

01:39:05.606 --> 01:39:07.241
I THINK ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW,

01:39:07.308 --> 01:39:09.510
IT'S TIMELY BECAUSE WITH THE

01:39:09.576 --> 01:39:12.546
RISE OF AI AND ALL THE WAYS IN

01:39:12.613 --> 01:39:15.983
WHICH PEOPLE CAN BE SCAMMED NOW,

01:39:16.050 --> 01:39:17.885
IT'S VERY, VERY CONCERNING TO

01:39:17.951 --> 01:39:21.522
NOT HAVE WAYS TO GO AFTER

01:39:21.588 --> 01:39:23.324
SCAMMERS, REMEDY THINGS AND

01:39:23.390 --> 01:39:26.527
REALLY ENFORCE CONSUMER

01:39:26.593 --> 01:39:28.062
PROTECTIONS AT THE STATE LEVEL,

01:39:28.128 --> 01:39:29.530
WHEN WE CAN'T REALLY RELY ON

01:39:29.596 --> 01:39:31.298
WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE FEDERAL

01:39:31.365 --> 01:39:33.000
LEVEL. SO I YOU KNOW, I THINK

01:39:33.067 --> 01:39:34.935
THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT BILL.

01:39:35.002 --> 01:39:37.071
I APPRECIATE THE LEADERSHIP ON

01:39:37.137 --> 01:39:40.007
THIS ISSUE AND THE DEDICATION TO

01:39:40.074 --> 01:39:41.308
MAKING SURE THAT CONSUMERS HAVE

01:39:41.375 --> 01:39:42.776
THE PROTECTION THAT THEY NEED

01:39:42.843 --> 01:39:44.678
MORE AND MORE EVERY DAY. THANK

01:39:44.745 --> 01:39:48.882
YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. ANY

01:39:48.949 --> 01:39:52.720
ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS? SENATOR,

01:39:52.786 --> 01:39:53.954
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE? THANK

01:39:54.021 --> 01:39:56.090
YOU. SO, YOU KNOW, FROM A BIGGER

01:39:56.156 --> 01:39:58.192
PICTURE, WHEN WE FIRST STARTED

01:39:58.258 --> 01:39:59.360
THINKING ABOUT THIS WILL, IT WAS

01:39:59.426 --> 01:40:01.195
ABOUT THE CHANGES THAT COULD

01:40:01.261 --> 01:40:02.496
HAVE HAPPENED AT THE FEDERAL

01:40:02.563 --> 01:40:05.766
LEVEL. IN APRIL, THE FEDERAL

01:40:05.833 --> 01:40:07.601
ADMINISTRATION CONFIRMED OUR

01:40:07.668 --> 01:40:09.937
FEARS. AND SO THE IDEA ISN'T TO

01:40:10.003 --> 01:40:13.273
CREATE A NEW LAW, BUT TO FIND A

01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:14.141
WAY TO ENFORCE EXISTING LAWS FOR

01:40:14.208 --> 01:40:15.642
CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. I ALSO

01:40:15.709 --> 01:40:17.644
WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THIS ISN'T

01:40:17.711 --> 01:40:19.546
AN EVERY DAY, ALL THE TIME

01:40:19.613 --> 01:40:21.014
ISSUE. THIS IS ONLY IF THERE IS

01:40:21.081 --> 01:40:23.317
A SEVERE ISSUE THAT HARMS

01:40:23.384 --> 01:40:25.219
CONSUMERS WHERE THEY FEEL THE

01:40:25.285 --> 01:40:26.620
NEED TO COME FORWARD. SO WE'RE

01:40:26.687 --> 01:40:28.822
NOT LOOKING AT EVERY DAY ALL THE

01:40:28.889 --> 01:40:31.024
TIME, 24 OVER SEVEN CALLS. WE'RE

01:40:31.091 --> 01:40:33.193
REALLY LOOKING TO SOME OF THE

01:40:33.260 --> 01:40:34.128
GREATEST ISSUES OR CONSUMERS AND

01:40:34.194 --> 01:40:36.029
FINDING A PLACE FOR THEM TO GO

01:40:36.096 --> 01:40:37.664
HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO ENSURE

01:40:37.731 --> 01:40:39.199
THAT THEIR CURRENT PROTECTIONS

01:40:39.266 --> 01:40:41.001
AREN'T MINIMIZED. SO I THINK

01:40:41.068 --> 01:40:42.703
THAT THIS IS WHERE WE'RE COMING

01:40:42.770 --> 01:40:44.705
FROM. THIS IS WHERE WE HOPE TO

01:40:44.772 --> 01:40:46.440
TAKE THE BILL. AND LIKE ALWAYS,

01:40:46.507 --> 01:40:48.308
WE'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH

01:40:48.375 --> 01:40:50.310
OPPOSITION TO SEE WHERE THIS CAN

01:40:50.377 --> 01:40:52.613
GO. BUT THE ENFORCEMENT PIECE IS

01:40:52.679 --> 01:40:55.282
IMPORTANT FOR US BECAUSE THESE

01:40:55.349 --> 01:40:56.950
ARE GOING TO BE SOME RARE

01:40:57.017 --> 01:40:58.452
SITUATIONS. AND WE WANT TO MAKE

01:40:58.519 --> 01:41:00.187
SURE THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF THE

01:41:00.254 --> 01:41:01.588
CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT USED

01:41:01.655 --> 01:41:03.424
TO EXIST AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL,

01:41:03.490 --> 01:41:05.592
CALIFORNIA HAS A WAY TO ENFORCE

01:41:05.659 --> 01:41:07.895
THOSE PROTECTIONS FOR OUR

01:41:07.961 --> 01:41:09.163
CONSUMERS. WITH THAT, I

01:41:09.229 --> 01:41:10.964
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE

01:41:11.031 --> 01:41:13.567
VOTE. THANK YOU. FEDERAL

01:41:13.634 --> 01:41:15.335
OVERSIGHT IS MOST DEFINITELY

01:41:15.402 --> 01:41:16.804
SHIFTING AND UNCERTAIN

01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:17.871
CONSIDERING EVERYTHING THAT IS

01:41:17.938 --> 01:41:19.940
GOING ON. STATES ARE

01:41:20.007 --> 01:41:21.275
INCREASINGLY, INCREASINGLY

01:41:21.341 --> 01:41:23.677
TAKING THE LEAD WHEN IT COMES TO

01:41:23.744 --> 01:41:25.546
FINANCIAL OVERSIGHT, AND THIS

01:41:25.612 --> 01:41:27.114
BILL IS A STEP IN ENSURING THAT

01:41:27.181 --> 01:41:28.582
CALIFORNIA IS TRACKING IN THAT

01:41:28.649 --> 01:41:30.717
DIRECTION AS WELL. AND I DO

01:41:30.784 --> 01:41:32.953
BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS

01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:34.021
APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME TO

01:41:34.087 --> 01:41:35.722
ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE

01:41:35.789 --> 01:41:38.625
PROTECTED FROM A CONSUMER LENS.

01:41:38.692 --> 01:41:40.861
WITH THAT, DO WE HAVE A MOTION?

01:41:40.928 --> 01:41:43.230
