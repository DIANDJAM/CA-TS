DESTRUCTIVE OIL SPILLS IN

01:15:39.201 --> 01:15:40.769
CALIFORNIA. FIRST, IT REQUIRES

01:15:40.836 --> 01:15:42.037
HYDROSTATIC TESTING FOR EACH

01:15:42.104 --> 01:15:43.705

OPERATORS CAN DEMONSTRATE TO

DAMAGE COSTS. PAST OIL SPILLS

01:16:11.867 --> 01:16:13.602
HAVE REVEALED SERIOUS

01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:15.604
SHORTFALLS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE

01:16:15.671 --> 01:16:17.606
2015 SANTA BARBARA SPILL, WHICH

01:16:17.673 --> 01:16:19.508

01:16:19.574 --> 01:16:22.110
CORROSION, CAUSED $870 MILLION

01:16:22.177 --> 01:16:24.279
IN DAMAGE COSTS, BUT THEIR

01:16:24.346 --> 01:16:26.181
OPERATORS ONLY HAD TO SHOW $30

01:16:26.248 --> 01:16:28.183
MILLION IN COVERAGE. INDIRECT

01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:29.685
TESTING THERE FAILED TO

ACCURATELY DETERMINE THE DEGREE

01:16:30.919 --> 01:16:33.221
OF CORROSION. HYDRO TESTING IS A

01:16:33.288 --> 01:16:35.123
DIRECT ASSESSMENT, A CLEARER

01:16:35.190 --> 01:16:37.159
MEASURE OF PIPELINE INTEGRITY.

ACCURATELY CALCULATE THE TRUE

01:16:50.539 --> 01:16:52.040
COSTS OF CLEANUP AND

01:16:52.107 --> 01:16:53.375
RESTORATION. THIS BILL IS

01:16:53.442 --> 01:16:55.177
NARROWLY DRAFTED. ITS HYDRO TEST

WILL TAKE A CRUCIAL STEP TOWARDS

01:20:53.481 --> 01:20:55.650
IMPROVING THE AVAILABILITY AND

01:20:55.717 --> 01:20:57.052
AFFORDABILITY OF PROPERTY

01:20:57.118 --> 01:20:58.186
INSURANCE. THIS ISSUE IS

01:20:58.253 --> 01:20:59.654
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO ALL OF

01:20:59.721 --> 01:21:01.022

01:21:01.089 --> 01:21:03.425
BEEN HIT WITH A LOT OF TRAGEDIES

01:21:03.491 --> 01:21:05.360
AS IT PERTAINS TO WILDFIRES, AND

01:21:05.427 --> 01:21:07.128
WE NEED ALL VOICES AT THE TABLE.

01:21:07.195 --> 01:21:09.097
WHAT WE LEARNED IS THAT THERE'S

01:21:09.164 --> 01:21:11.833
A LOT OF NEED, AND WE NEED TO

01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:13.602
SOLVE THE CRISIS, AND THIS IS

01:21:13.668 --> 01:21:15.537
THE FIRST STEP MOVING FORWARD TO

01:21:15.604 --> 01:21:17.205
ENSURE THAT WE THAT WE DO THAT.

01:21:17.272 --> 01:21:19.741
SB 616 WILL CREATE AN

01:21:19.808 --> 01:21:21.843
INDEPENDENT COMMUNITY HARDENING

01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:22.811
COMMISSION WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT

01:21:22.877 --> 01:21:24.546
OF INSURANCE. THE COMMISSION

01:21:24.613 --> 01:21:26.214
WILL BE TASKED WITH BRINGING

01:21:26.281 --> 01:21:27.549
TOGETHER STATE AND LOCAL

01:21:27.616 --> 01:21:29.217
GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES, AS WELL

01:21:29.284 --> 01:21:31.286
AS EXPERTS AND STAKEHOLDERS, TO

01:21:31.353 --> 01:21:34.456
CREATE CONSISTENT, DATA DRIVEN

01:21:34.522 --> 01:21:35.557
RECOMMENDATIONS TO STANDARDS

01:21:35.624 --> 01:21:38.059
NEEDED TO GUIDE STATEWIDE FIRE

01:21:38.126 --> 01:21:39.894
MITIGATION POLICIES AND PROGRAMS

01:21:39.961 --> 01:21:41.730
ACROSS OUR STATE AND LOCAL

01:21:41.796 --> 01:21:43.531
AGENCIES. EFFECTIVE FIRE

01:21:43.598 --> 01:21:44.532
MITIGATION IS CRITICALLY

01:21:44.599 --> 01:21:46.334
IMPORTANT TO HELP IMPROVE THE

01:21:46.401 --> 01:21:47.269
AVAILABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY

01:21:47.335 --> 01:21:49.671
OF PROPERTY INSURANCE. AS WE ALL

01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:51.840
HAVE HEARD THE STORIES, THAT IS

01:21:51.906 --> 01:21:53.208
ONE OF THE PRESSING ISSUES OF

01:21:53.275 --> 01:21:55.710
THE DAY. NOT ONLY IS IT NOT

01:21:55.777 --> 01:21:57.512
AVAILABLE, BUT SOMETIMES THE

01:21:57.579 --> 01:22:00.749
COST IS UNSUSTAINABLE, WHICH IS

01:22:00.815 --> 01:22:02.183
AGAIN WHY THIS BILL IS

01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:03.718
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND NEEDED

01:22:03.785 --> 01:22:06.521
AT THIS TIME UNDER EXISTING LAW,

01:22:06.588 --> 01:22:07.922
WORK ON COMMUNITY AND HOME

01:22:07.989 --> 01:22:09.424
HARDENING IS GUIDED THROUGH AN

01:22:09.491 --> 01:22:11.559
ARRAY OF STATE CODES,

01:22:11.626 --> 01:22:13.328
REGULATIONS BY THE STATE AND

01:22:13.395 --> 01:22:14.462
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, AS WELL AS

01:22:14.529 --> 01:22:16.298
GUIDELINES FROM NONPROFIT

01:22:16.364 --> 01:22:17.999
ORGANIZATIONS. AND HERE ARE SOME

01:22:18.066 --> 01:22:20.235
OF THE LIST OF ALL THE

01:22:20.302 --> 01:22:21.336
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ALL THE

01:22:21.403 --> 01:22:22.804
PEOPLE THAT GET TOGETHER TO GIVE

01:22:22.871 --> 01:22:24.873
US THOSE GUIDELINES. CALIFORNIA

01:22:24.939 --> 01:22:27.175
BUILDING CODE, CHAPTER SEVEN A

01:22:27.242 --> 01:22:28.576
CALIFORNIA FIRE CODE. CHAPTER 49

01:22:28.643 --> 01:22:31.012
ON REQUIREMENTS FOR WILDFIRE

01:22:31.079 --> 01:22:33.081
URBAN INTERFACE AREAS THE SAFER

01:22:33.148 --> 01:22:34.883
FROM WILDFIRE BY THE DEPARTMENT

01:22:34.949 --> 01:22:36.051
OF INSURANCE, THE LOW COST

01:22:36.117 --> 01:22:37.452
RETROFIT LIST FROM THE STATE

01:22:37.519 --> 01:22:39.187
FIRE MARSHAL. THE DEFENSIBLE

01:22:39.254 --> 01:22:41.122
SPACE GUIDELINES FROM THE BOARD

01:22:41.189 --> 01:22:42.891
OF FORESTRY, AND MANY, MANY

01:22:42.957 --> 01:22:45.460
MORE. SO THIS SIMPLY ATTEMPTS TO

01:22:45.527 --> 01:22:48.229
BRING ALL THESE VOICES TOGETHER,

01:22:48.296 --> 01:22:50.598
WORK IN COLLABORATION, AND MAKE

01:22:50.665 --> 01:22:52.467
SURE THAT WE'RE ALL MOVING IN

01:22:52.534 --> 01:22:53.735
THE SAME DIRECTION AGAIN. THE

01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:55.236
FACT REMAINS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE

01:22:55.303 --> 01:22:56.638
IS MAKING WILDFIRES MORE

01:22:56.705 --> 01:22:58.740
FREQUENT AND MORE DESTRUCTIVE.

01:22:58.807 --> 01:23:00.508
EVERY TIME WE GET HIT WITH

01:23:00.575 --> 01:23:02.377
WILDFIRES, THE GROWING WILDFIRE

01:23:02.444 --> 01:23:04.846
RISK ARE DRIVING THE COST UP OF

01:23:04.913 --> 01:23:07.015
INSURANCE, AND THE AVAILABILITY

01:23:07.082 --> 01:23:10.919
IS AN EQUALLY BIG CRISIS AS

01:23:10.985 --> 01:23:12.053
HOMEOWNERS AND COMMUNITIES WORK

01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:13.822
SO HARD IN THEIR PROPERTIES TO

01:23:13.888 --> 01:23:15.323
MAKE THEM MORE RESILIENT TO

01:23:15.390 --> 01:23:17.459
WILDFIRE. THE KEY TO SUCCESS IS

01:23:17.525 --> 01:23:19.627
THE COORDINATION OF ACTION

01:23:19.694 --> 01:23:21.563
ACROSS ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT

01:23:21.629 --> 01:23:23.898
AND BRINGING LEADERS TOGETHER,

01:23:23.965 --> 01:23:25.367
LISTENING TO DIFFERENT

01:23:25.433 --> 01:23:28.269
PERSPECTIVES, FIRE SCIENCE,

01:23:28.336 --> 01:23:29.671
CONSTRUCTION LEADERS, PLANNING

01:23:29.738 --> 01:23:32.240
INSURANCE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE

01:23:32.307 --> 01:23:33.608
DISCIPLINES TO ENSURE THAT WE

01:23:33.675 --> 01:23:35.310
GET IT RIGHT. THE COMMISSION

01:23:35.377 --> 01:23:37.045
WILL BE COMPRISED OF SEVEN

01:23:37.112 --> 01:23:39.481
MEMBERS OR THEIR DESIGNEES. IN

01:23:39.547 --> 01:23:40.882
ADDITION, THE COMMISSION WILL BE

01:23:40.949 --> 01:23:42.217
ADVISED BY AN ADVISORY COUNCIL

01:23:42.283 --> 01:23:43.752
MADE UP OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM

01:23:43.818 --> 01:23:46.588
A DIVERSE GROUP OF PEOPLE, AGAIN

01:23:46.654 --> 01:23:49.090

EQUALLY IMPORTANT, IN THE EVENT

OF FUTURE WILDFIRES, THIS IS

01:23:58.133 --> 01:24:00.301
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO ENSURE

01:24:00.368 --> 01:24:02.504
THAT WE DO A POSTMORTEM PER SE

01:24:02.570 --> 01:24:04.239
AND MAKE SURE THAT WE LOOK AT

01:24:04.305 --> 01:24:06.074
THE LESSONS LEARNED, LEARNED

01:24:06.141 --> 01:24:08.176
WHAT CAN WE LEARN, WHAT CAN WE

01:24:08.243 --> 01:24:09.944
DO BETTER AND PERFECT WHAT WE'VE

01:24:10.011 --> 01:24:11.813
BEEN WORKING ON? SO TODAY, I

REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 470

01:28:33.941 --> 01:28:36.010
PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES STATEWIDE.

WE RESPECTFULLY HAVE AN OPPOSE

01:28:37.612 --> 01:28:40.048
UNLESS AMENDED, POSITION ON SB

01:28:40.114 --> 01:28:41.416
606, REQUESTING THAT COMMUNITY

01:28:41.482 --> 01:28:43.351
HARDENING STANDARDS RELATING TO

THE IMPROVEMENTS TO WATER

01:28:45.153 --> 01:28:45.920
INFRASTRUCTURE BE STRUCK FROM

01:28:45.987 --> 01:28:48.589
THE BILL. ACWA APPRECIATES OUR

01:28:48.656 --> 01:28:49.691
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR'S

01:28:49.757 --> 01:28:50.892
OFFICE AND THEIR WILLINGNESS TO

01:28:50.958 --> 01:28:52.260
HEAR OUR CONCERNS AND LOOK

01:28:52.326 --> 01:28:53.561
FORWARD TO FUTURE CONVERSATIONS

01:28:53.628 --> 01:28:55.463
ABOUT THIS BILL, BUT WE HAVE

01:28:55.530 --> 01:28:56.964
REVIEWED THE RECENT AMENDMENTS

01:28:57.031 --> 01:28:58.666
AND OUR CONCERNS STILL REMAIN.

01:28:58.733 --> 01:29:00.301
PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES ARE TASKED

01:29:00.368 --> 01:29:01.602
WITH PROVIDING THE PUBLIC WITH

01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:03.037
SAFE AND RELIABLE DRINKING

01:29:03.104 --> 01:29:04.305
WATER. THESE WATER SYSTEMS ARE

01:29:04.372 --> 01:29:05.907
NOT DESIGNED TO COMBAT

01:29:05.973 --> 01:29:06.641
WILDFIRES, ESPECIALLY THE

01:29:06.708 --> 01:29:08.042
CLIMATE DRIVEN WILDFIRES.

01:29:08.109 --> 01:29:09.844
CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCES TODAY.

01:29:09.911 --> 01:29:10.978
THERE ARE CONCERNS THAT THE

01:29:11.045 --> 01:29:12.714
BILL'S PROPOSED COMMISSION, WITH

01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:14.449
A FOCUS ON FIRE INSURANCE AND

01:29:14.515 --> 01:29:16.284
WITH THE LACK OF UTILITY

01:29:16.350 --> 01:29:17.418
REPRESENTATION, COULD CREATE

01:29:17.485 --> 01:29:18.820
STATEWIDE STANDARDS FOR WATER

01:29:18.886 --> 01:29:19.921
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ARE NOT

01:29:19.987 --> 01:29:21.355
ALIGNED WITH WATER AGENCY'S

01:29:21.422 --> 01:29:22.857
OBJECTIVE OF PROVIDING SAFE AND

01:29:22.924 --> 01:29:24.959
RELIABLE DRINKING WATER. PUBLIC

01:29:25.026 --> 01:29:26.394
WATER AGENCIES ARE THE EXPERTS

01:29:26.461 --> 01:29:28.229
OF THEIR UNIQUE SYSTEMS, AND ARE

01:29:28.296 --> 01:29:29.964
THE BEST ENTITY FOR DETERMINING

01:29:30.031 --> 01:29:31.232
WATER INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS TO

01:29:31.299 --> 01:29:32.266
BEST SERVE THE COMMUNITIES THEY

01:29:32.333 --> 01:29:34.335
ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO. WE BELIEVE

01:29:34.402 --> 01:29:35.436
IT IS INAPPROPRIATE FOR THE

01:29:35.503 --> 01:29:36.871
COMMISSION TO DEVELOP SUCH

01:29:36.938 --> 01:29:38.172
STATEWIDE STANDARDS, AND THAT

01:29:38.239 --> 01:29:39.073
THESE STANDARDS WOULD NOT

01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:40.475
REFLECT THE COMPLEXITIES OF OUR

01:29:40.541 --> 01:29:42.643
WATER SYSTEMS. WATER AGENCIES

01:29:42.710 --> 01:29:44.412
HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS,

01:29:44.479 --> 01:29:45.546
INCLUDING MAINTAINING WATER

01:29:45.613 --> 01:29:47.215
QUALITY, FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS,

01:29:47.281 --> 01:29:49.083
AND OTHER OPERATIONAL REALITIES.

01:29:49.150 --> 01:29:51.052
THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS

01:29:51.119 --> 01:29:53.488
OF A POTENTIAL INCREASED RISK TO

01:29:53.554 --> 01:29:54.655
LITIGATION IF WATER AGENCIES

01:29:54.722 --> 01:29:56.090
FAIL TO MEET THE ESTABLISHED

01:29:56.157 --> 01:29:57.425
STANDARDS FOLLOWING A WILDFIRE

01:29:57.492 --> 01:29:59.560
EVENT, COSTS FROM POTENTIAL

01:29:59.627 --> 01:30:00.762
LITIGATION WOULD ULTIMATELY FALL

01:30:00.828 --> 01:30:03.464
ON RATEPAYERS, IMPACTING WATER

01:30:03.531 --> 01:30:05.032
AFFORDABILITY. ULTIMATELY, THIS

01:30:05.099 --> 01:30:07.702
IS NOT THE RIGHT BODY TO BE

01:30:07.769 --> 01:30:08.336
MAKING SUCH RECOMMENDATIONS IN

01:30:08.402 --> 01:30:09.670
REGARDS TO CALIFORNIA'S WATER

01:30:09.737 --> 01:30:10.772
INFRASTRUCTURE. WE LOOK FORWARD

01:30:10.838 --> 01:30:12.140
TO FUTURE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

01:30:12.206 --> 01:30:15.109
AUTHOR AND HER STAFF FOR THESE

01:30:15.176 --> 01:30:16.511
REASONS AND WITHOUT THE

01:30:16.577 --> 01:30:17.912
REQUESTED AMENDMENTS, ALSO

01:30:17.979 --> 01:30:19.147

ANYONE WHO'D LIKE TO JOIN AND

01:30:27.321 --> 01:30:29.791
OPPOSITION TO THE BILL? GOOD

01:30:29.857 --> 01:30:30.958

01:30:47.074 --> 01:30:48.743
OPPOSED POSITION. WE APPRECIATE

01:30:48.810 --> 01:30:50.711
THE DIRECTION OF THE AMENDMENTS.

01:30:50.778 --> 01:30:51.913
WE'VE BEEN WORKING REALLY

01:30:51.979 --> 01:30:52.980
CLOSELY WITH THE SENATOR AND HER

01:30:53.047 --> 01:30:55.283
TEAM, AND WE'RE HOPEFUL WE CAN

01:30:55.349 --> 01:30:55.883
GET THERE. BUT AT THIS POINT,

01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:57.852
STILL A FEW REMAINING ISSUES

01:30:57.919 --> 01:31:00.221
WE'D LIKE TO WORK THROUGH. THANK

THAT WERE STATED. BUT I JUST

01:31:18.973 --> 01:31:21.976
WANT TO BE CLEAR. THIS BILL HAS

01:31:22.043 --> 01:31:24.512
NO MANDATES FOR WATER

01:31:24.579 --> 01:31:25.680
INFRASTRUCTURE. WE'RE REALLY

01:31:25.746 --> 01:31:28.149
JUST TRYING TO GET AT THE HEART

01:31:28.216 --> 01:31:29.550

SEPARATELY AND BRINGING EVERYONE

01:31:30.751 --> 01:31:32.820

MARKET HAS BEEN DESTABILIZED,

01:31:34.689 --> 01:31:36.424
AND WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:31:36.490 --> 01:31:38.226

01:31:38.292 --> 01:31:39.660

THERE'S A CRISIS, WE CAN MOVE

01:31:43.431 --> 01:31:44.065

01:31:44.131 --> 01:31:45.833

SB 429, WHICH ESTABLISHES THE

01:33:19.393 --> 01:33:22.263
NATION'S FIRST PUBLIC WILDFIRE

01:33:22.330 --> 01:33:23.698
CATASTROPHE MODEL. I WILL BE

01:33:23.764 --> 01:33:25.066
ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE

01:33:25.132 --> 01:33:26.934
AMENDMENTS AS OUTLINED ON PAGE

01:33:27.001 --> 01:33:29.437
FOUR OF THE ANALYSIS. AND I

01:33:29.503 --> 01:33:30.604
APPRECIATE THE WORK AND THE HELP

01:33:30.671 --> 01:33:32.073

THROUGH THIS AND TO THE CHAIR AS

01:33:34.909 --> 01:33:36.310
WELL. CALIFORNIA IS EXPERIENCING

01:33:36.377 --> 01:33:39.213
AN INSURANCE CRISIS THAT WE ALL

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:40.881
KNOW, AND IT'S ONE THAT'S BEEN

01:33:40.948 --> 01:33:42.683
DRIVEN IN LARGE PART BY OUR

01:33:42.750 --> 01:33:45.219
INCREASED WILDFIRE RISK. AS OF

01:33:45.286 --> 01:33:47.488
2023, NEARLY 1.3 MILLION HOMES

01:33:47.555 --> 01:33:49.290
WERE AT RISK OF EXTREME

01:33:49.357 --> 01:33:50.291
WILDFIRES, AND OVER 80% OF NEW

01:33:50.358 --> 01:33:51.859
PROPERTIES BUILT WERE IN HIGH OR

01:33:51.926 --> 01:33:54.595
VERY HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS.

01:33:54.662 --> 01:33:55.730
CATASTROPHE MODELS PREDICT THE

01:33:55.796 --> 01:33:57.565
FUTURE LOSSES OF NATURAL

01:33:57.631 --> 01:33:59.367
DISASTERS, AND ARE OFTEN USED AS

01:33:59.433 --> 01:34:00.768
BENCHMARKS TO ESTABLISH ZONES OF

01:34:00.835 --> 01:34:03.304
RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL RISK.

01:34:03.371 --> 01:34:05.072
PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE DATA AND

ASPECT OF SB 256. THIS BILL

01:46:12.632 --> 01:46:14.067

PERMANENTLY ABANDONED FACILITIES

01:46:23.643 --> 01:46:25.946
AS SPECIFIED. LET ME EXPLAIN WHY

01:46:26.012 --> 01:46:27.981
THIS PARTICULAR ELEMENT IN THE

01:46:28.048 --> 01:46:30.484
BILL RISES TO THE TOP FOR ME.

01:46:30.550 --> 01:46:32.452
EARLIER THIS YEAR, ON JANUARY

01:46:32.519 --> 01:46:35.589
7TH, 2025, A DEVASTATING FIRE

01:46:35.655 --> 01:46:37.824
STARTED IN EATON CANYON, LOCATED

01:46:37.891 --> 01:46:40.327
IN THE ALTADENA AREA. WHILE THEY

01:46:40.393 --> 01:46:42.496
ARE STILL UNDER INVESTIGATIONS

01:46:42.562 --> 01:46:44.631
UNDERWAY, VIDEO SHOWS FIRE

01:46:44.698 --> 01:46:47.167
SPARKING AROUND 40FT UP AT THE

01:46:47.234 --> 01:46:48.668
WIRES OF A TRANSMISSION TOWER ON

01:46:48.735 --> 01:46:50.437
THE MOUNTAIN JUST ABOVE THE

01:46:50.504 --> 01:46:52.272
CANYON. A SEPARATE VIDEO SHOWS

01:46:52.339 --> 01:46:53.673
FIRE ON THE GROUND UNDER THE

01:46:53.740 --> 01:46:55.142
TOWER SHORTLY AFTER THE MASSIVE

01:46:55.208 --> 01:46:57.511
SPARKS OCCURRED. HERE'S WHAT IS

01:46:57.577 --> 01:46:58.912
IMPORTANT TO NOTE. THE

01:46:58.979 --> 01:47:00.480
TRANSMISSION TOWER MENTIONED HAD

01:47:00.547 --> 01:47:02.282
NOT BEEN USED BY SOCAL EDISON

01:47:02.349 --> 01:47:04.417
FOR MORE THAN 50 YEARS, BUT

01:47:04.484 --> 01:47:05.786
EDISON OFFICIALS TOLD THE LOS

01:47:05.852 --> 01:47:07.754
ANGELES TIMES THAT THE TOWER AND

01:47:07.821 --> 01:47:10.123
THE IDLE LINE IT CARRIED SOMEHOW

01:47:10.190 --> 01:47:11.525
BECAME RE-ENERGIZED THE DAY THE

01:47:11.591 --> 01:47:14.060
FIRE STARTED. THE LINE ON THAT

01:47:14.127 --> 01:47:16.263
TOWER IS CALLED THE MESA SYLMAR

01:47:16.329 --> 01:47:18.198
LINE, THE COMPANY REPORTED TO

01:47:18.265 --> 01:47:20.066
STATE REGULATORS THAT FOUR

01:47:20.133 --> 01:47:21.334
LINES, INCLUDING THE DORMANT

01:47:21.401 --> 01:47:23.436
MESA SYLMAR LINE, SAW A

01:47:23.503 --> 01:47:24.971
MOMENTARY INCREASE OF ELECTRICAL

01:47:25.038 --> 01:47:26.139
CURRENT AT AROUND THE SAME TIME

01:47:26.206 --> 01:47:28.341
THE FIRE BEGAN. IN AN INTERVIEW

01:47:28.408 --> 01:47:30.710
WITH THE TIMES, PEDRO PIZARRO,

01:47:30.777 --> 01:47:32.546
EDISON INTERNATIONAL CHIEF

01:47:32.612 --> 01:47:34.648
EXECUTIVE, SAID THE

01:47:34.714 --> 01:47:35.749
REORGANIZATION OF THE LINE

01:47:35.816 --> 01:47:37.617
THROUGH A RARE PHENOMENON KNOWN

01:47:37.684 --> 01:47:39.119
AS INDUCTION IS NOW A LEADING

01:47:39.186 --> 01:47:40.287
THEORY INTO WHAT SPARKED THE

01:47:40.353 --> 01:47:41.822
DEADLY WILDFIRE THAT DESTROYED

01:47:41.888 --> 01:47:44.024
HALF THE TOWN OF ALTADENA.

01:47:44.090 --> 01:47:46.092
10,000 STRUCTURES AND MOST

01:47:46.159 --> 01:47:47.894
IMPORTANTLY AND TERRIBLY, 18

01:47:47.961 --> 01:47:49.729
LIVES WERE LOST BECAUSE OF A

01:47:49.796 --> 01:47:51.531
LONG DECOMMISSIONED TOWER AND

01:47:51.598 --> 01:47:52.866
DORMANT LINE THAT WAS ALLOWED TO

01:47:52.933 --> 01:47:55.101
STAY IN PLACE FOR MORE THAN 50

01:47:55.168 --> 01:47:56.536
YEARS. NO ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE

01:47:56.603 --> 01:47:57.904
DANGERS OF KEEPING IT UP THERE,

01:47:57.971 --> 01:47:59.773
NO REGULATIONS TO DEMAND ITS

01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:01.241
REMOVAL, BUT IT IS BEING

01:48:01.308 --> 01:48:03.043
PROPOSED NOW. SO WHAT WILL YOU

01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:05.712
DO? NEARLY 6000 HOMES, INCLUDING

01:48:05.779 --> 01:48:08.014
MY FAMILY'S HOME, EVERYTHING WE

01:48:08.081 --> 01:48:10.283
OWNED, EVERY ITEM OF HISTORY AND

01:48:10.350 --> 01:48:11.985
MEMORABILIA PASSED ON TO ME AND

01:48:12.052 --> 01:48:13.520
ENTRUSTED IN ME BY MY PARENTS.

01:48:13.587 --> 01:48:15.422
THROUGHOUT THE YEARS, EVERY

01:48:15.488 --> 01:48:16.756
MEMORY I SAVED FOR MY CHILDHOOD,

01:48:16.823 --> 01:48:18.258
AND HOPES OF PASSING ALONG TO MY

01:48:18.325 --> 01:48:21.394
OWN CHILDREN. MEMORABILIA ITEMS

01:48:21.461 --> 01:48:22.929
FOUND WHILE DIGGING THROUGH MY

01:48:22.996 --> 01:48:23.730
CHILDHOOD BASEMENT AND GARAGE

01:48:23.797 --> 01:48:26.032
WITH MY FATHER WHEN HE WAS DYING

01:48:26.099 --> 01:48:28.401
OF CANCER A FEW YEARS AGO. ALL

01:48:28.468 --> 01:48:31.605
GONE. THEIR SCHOOLS, CHURCHES,

01:48:31.671 --> 01:48:33.039
THE PARK WHERE MY HUSBAND AND I

01:48:33.106 --> 01:48:34.741
WERE MARRIED, AND THE BULK OF

01:48:34.808 --> 01:48:35.809
THE SHOPS AND RESTAURANTS WE

01:48:35.876 --> 01:48:37.177
WOULD FREQUENT, WE WOULD

01:48:37.244 --> 01:48:38.345
FREQUENT GONE. I MENTION ALL

01:48:38.411 --> 01:48:39.646
THESE PERSONAL AND HEARTBREAKING

01:48:39.713 --> 01:48:41.348
LOSSES BECAUSE I REMIND YOU,

01:48:41.414 --> 01:48:43.884
THERE WERE 6000 RESIDENCES LOST.

01:48:43.950 --> 01:48:45.285
SO THERE ARE 6000 MORE STORIES

01:48:45.352 --> 01:48:48.088
OF HEARTBREAK AND DEVASTATION,

01:48:48.154 --> 01:48:49.756
LIKELY BECAUSE A LONG DORMANT

01:48:49.823 --> 01:48:50.824
STRUCTURE THAT WAS ALLOWED TO

01:48:50.891 --> 01:48:52.192
SIT ON THAT MOUNTAINSIDE WITHOUT

01:48:52.259 --> 01:48:54.561
ANY REGULATION TO HAVE IT

01:48:54.628 --> 01:48:55.996
REMOVED. THIS BODY DID NOT SEE

01:48:56.062 --> 01:48:57.931
THE DANGER OF LETTING THAT SIT.

01:48:57.998 --> 01:48:59.866
AND NOW WE HAVE SUFFERED FOR

01:48:59.933 --> 01:49:00.834
THAT OVERSIGHT. BUT NOW WE HAVE

01:49:00.901 --> 01:49:03.236
THE CHANCE TO MAKE IT RIGHT FOR

01:49:03.303 --> 01:49:03.904
THE INEVITABLE DISASTERS YET TO

01:49:03.970 --> 01:49:06.006
COME. YOU MAKE MANY IMPORTANT

01:49:06.072 --> 01:49:07.440
DECISIONS AND PROTECT OUR STATE

01:49:07.507 --> 01:49:09.242
IN SO MANY WAYS. BUT I WOULD

01:49:09.309 --> 01:49:11.077
ARGUE THAT RARELY DO THOSE

01:49:11.144 --> 01:49:12.879
DECISIONS REACH THIS LEVEL OF

01:49:12.946 --> 01:49:14.281
CONSEQUENCE. YOU HAVE THE CHANCE

01:49:14.347 --> 01:49:15.949
TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND PUT

01:49:16.016 --> 01:49:17.484
FORWARD THE EFFORT TO KEEP US

01:49:17.550 --> 01:49:18.718
SAFE FROM DEVASTATION AND LOSS

01:49:18.785 --> 01:49:20.887
OF LIVES. IF THIS BILL DOES NOT

01:49:20.954 --> 01:49:22.255
MOVE FORWARD AND ANOTHER SIMILAR

01:49:22.322 --> 01:49:23.390
FUTURE DISASTER LIKE THIS

01:49:23.456 --> 01:49:24.991
OCCURS, YOU WILL NEED TO ASK WHY

01:49:25.058 --> 01:49:26.826
WE DIDN'T DO THE WORK TO STOP IT

01:49:26.893 --> 01:49:28.895
WHEN WE HAD THE CHANCE. I URGE

01:49:28.962 --> 01:49:30.630
YOU TO PASS THIS OUT OF

01:49:30.697 --> 01:49:31.932
COMMITTEE SO NOBODY HAS TO

01:49:31.998 --> 01:49:32.699
EXPERIENCE WHAT ALTADENA DID.

01:49:32.766 --> 01:49:36.002

SENATE BILL 509 BY SENATOR

01:50:41.568 --> 01:50:43.069
CABALLERO. IT IS WITH THE OFFICE

01:50:43.136 --> 01:50:44.337
OF EMERGENCY SERVICES, TRAINING

01:50:44.404 --> 01:50:47.007
AND TRANSNATIONAL REPRESSION.

01:50:47.073 --> 01:50:56.916
SENATOR, WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.

01:50:56.983 --> 01:50:59.419
THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR, AND

DEVELOP SPECIALIZED TRAINING FOR

01:51:07.861 --> 01:51:09.295
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO

01:51:09.362 --> 01:51:10.630
RECOGNIZE AND RESPOND TO THE

01:51:10.697 --> 01:51:12.699
GROWING THREAT POSED BY FOREIGN

01:51:12.766 --> 01:51:15.235
GOVERNMENTS TARGETING DIASPORA

01:51:15.301 --> 01:51:16.770
COMMUNITIES. WE'D LIKE TO THANK

01:51:16.836 --> 01:51:18.872
THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE

01:51:18.938 --> 01:51:19.472
STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS

01:51:19.539 --> 01:51:20.740
BILL, AND WILL BE ACCEPTING THE

01:51:20.807 --> 01:51:22.075
COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS.

01:51:22.142 --> 01:51:23.476
MARGINALIZED GROUPS, IDENTIFIED

01:51:23.543 --> 01:51:25.712
AS DISSIDENTS AND ASYLUM SEEKERS

01:51:25.779 --> 01:51:27.580
TO THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING

01:51:27.647 --> 01:51:30.083
ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS MINORITIES,

01:51:30.150 --> 01:51:31.251
INCREASINGLY FACE ATTACKS ON

01:51:31.317 --> 01:51:32.852
THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS WHILE IN THE

01:51:32.919 --> 01:51:35.188
US FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS

01:51:35.255 --> 01:51:37.223
HOSTILE TO THEM. THESE COUNTRIES

01:51:37.290 --> 01:51:38.825
SEE THEIR DIASPORA COMMUNITIES

01:51:38.892 --> 01:51:40.894
AS THREATS TO THEIR POLITICAL

01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:43.029
STABILITY AND OFTEN EXTEND THE

01:51:43.096 --> 01:51:44.497
REPRESSIVE MEASURES BEYOND THEIR

01:51:44.564 --> 01:51:46.599
OWN NATIONAL BORDERS.

01:51:46.666 --> 01:51:47.967
AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES HAVE MADE

01:51:48.034 --> 01:51:49.769
USE OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES

01:51:49.836 --> 01:51:52.072
SUCH AS DIGITAL SURVEILLANCE AND

01:51:52.138 --> 01:51:53.773
SOCIAL MEDIA MONITORING TO

01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:55.975
TRACK, INTIMIDATE, AND THREATEN

01:51:56.042 --> 01:51:57.777
INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN DEMOCRATIC

01:51:57.844 --> 01:52:00.346
COUNTRIES. TACTICS SUCH AS

01:52:00.413 --> 01:52:01.748
HARASSMENT, THREATS, AND EVEN

01:52:01.815 --> 01:52:03.817
PHYSICAL VIOLENCE OFTEN CARRIED

01:52:03.883 --> 01:52:05.652
OUT COVERTLY OR WITH THE

01:52:05.718 --> 01:52:07.420
ASSISTANCE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW

01:52:07.487 --> 01:52:09.322
ENFORCEMENT, UNDERMINE THE RIGHT

01:52:09.389 --> 01:52:11.091
TO SAFETY AND FREEDOM OF

01:52:11.157 --> 01:52:12.192
EXPRESSION TO THEIR FORMER

01:52:12.258 --> 01:52:14.294
COUNTRY PEOPLE. TRANSNATIONAL

01:52:14.360 --> 01:52:15.728
REPRESSION IS A DIRECT VIOLATION

01:52:15.795 --> 01:52:17.230
OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF THOSE

01:52:17.297 --> 01:52:18.932
LIVING IN THE DIASPORA,

01:52:18.998 --> 01:52:20.467
ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO HAVE SOUGHT

01:52:20.533 --> 01:52:22.969
REFUGE IN DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES.

01:52:23.036 --> 01:52:24.804
WHILE THE UNITED STATES HAS

01:52:24.871 --> 01:52:26.239
MECHANISMS IN PLACE TO PROTECT

01:52:26.306 --> 01:52:28.308
INDIVIDUALS FROM TRANSNATIONAL

01:52:28.374 --> 01:52:29.576
REPRESSION, THE CURRENT SYSTEM

01:52:29.642 --> 01:52:32.679
IS NOT FULLY EQUIPPED, AND LOCAL

01:52:32.745 --> 01:52:33.813
POLICE DEPARTMENTS ARE NOT

01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:35.748
TRAINED TO KNOW HOW TO DOCUMENT

01:52:35.815 --> 01:52:37.450
THE GROWING SCALE OF THESE

01:52:37.517 --> 01:52:39.085
THREATS. A MORE COMPREHENSIVE

01:52:39.152 --> 01:52:40.720
AND COORDINATED APPROACH WOULD

01:52:40.787 --> 01:52:42.489
HELP ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA CAN

01:52:42.555 --> 01:52:44.958
PROVIDE ADEQUATE DATA AND

01:52:45.024 --> 01:52:47.093
INFORMATION TO THE VICTIMS OF

01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:49.629
TRANSNATIONAL REPRESSION. SB 509

01:52:49.696 --> 01:52:50.730
STRENGTHENS OUR COUNTRY'S

01:52:50.797 --> 01:52:52.565
COMMITMENT TO HUMAN RIGHTS,

01:52:52.632 --> 01:52:54.234
SAFETY, AND JUSTICE FOR EVERY

01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:56.069
LAW ABIDING INDIVIDUAL,

01:52:56.136 --> 01:52:57.170
REGARDLESS OF THEIR BACKGROUND

01:52:57.237 --> 01:52:58.938
OR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN. THE BILL

01:52:59.005 --> 01:53:00.373
ENSURES THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:02.175
OFFICERS RECEIVE THE SPECIALIZED

01:53:02.242 --> 01:53:04.277
TRAINING NEEDED TO RECOGNIZE AND

01:53:04.344 --> 01:53:05.845
RESPOND TO THE UNIQUE THREATS

01:53:05.912 --> 01:53:07.647
POSED BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS

01:53:07.714 --> 01:53:09.349
TARGETING INDIVIDUALS ON U.S.

01:53:09.415 --> 01:53:11.217
SOIL. WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN

01:53:11.284 --> 01:53:13.486
SUPPORT IS JONATHAN FELDMAN WITH

01:53:13.553 --> 01:53:15.522
THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS

01:53:15.588 --> 01:53:18.057
ASSOCIATION AND HAMID

01:53:18.124 --> 01:53:18.591
YAZDANPANAH WITH IMMIGRANT

01:53:18.658 --> 01:53:21.628
DEFENSE ADVOCATES. THANK YOU,

01:53:21.694 --> 01:53:23.029
SENATOR, AND FOR YOUR WITNESSES.

01:53:23.096 --> 01:53:25.698
YOU'LL HAVE TWO MINUTES EACH.

01:53:25.765 --> 01:53:29.435
THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON. MY

01:53:29.502 --> 01:53:31.337
NAME IS HAMID YAZDANPANAH. I'M

01:53:31.404 --> 01:53:32.839
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF

01:53:32.906 --> 01:53:34.507
IMMIGRANT DEFENSE ADVOCATES. WE

01:53:34.574 --> 01:53:36.075
WORK DIRECTLY WITH IMMIGRANT

01:53:36.142 --> 01:53:37.477
COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE OF

01:53:37.544 --> 01:53:38.745
CALIFORNIA, FOCUSING ON POLICIES

01:53:38.811 --> 01:53:41.080
THAT PROTECT THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF

01:53:41.147 --> 01:53:42.482
IMMIGRANTS, REFUGEES AND ASYLUM

01:53:42.549 --> 01:53:45.051
SEEKERS. AS AN IRANIAN REFUGEE

01:53:45.118 --> 01:53:46.920
AND FORMER IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY,

01:53:46.986 --> 01:53:48.721
I'VE SEEN FIRSTHAND THE DANGERS

01:53:48.788 --> 01:53:50.523
PEOPLE FLEE AND THE THREATS THAT

01:53:50.590 --> 01:53:52.292
CAN FOLLOW THEM. MY FAMILY CAME

01:53:52.358 --> 01:53:53.860
TO THE UNITED STATES TO ESCAPE

01:53:53.927 --> 01:53:55.562
POLITICAL REPRESSION IN IRAN,

01:53:55.628 --> 01:53:56.930
AND NEARLY THREE DECADES LATER,

01:53:56.996 --> 01:53:58.765
THE IRANIAN REGIME STILL TARGETS

01:53:58.831 --> 01:54:01.301
DISSIDENTS HERE ON U.S. SOIL.

01:54:01.367 --> 01:54:03.102
JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO, TWO MEN

01:54:03.169 --> 01:54:04.304
WERE CONVICTED IN NEW YORK IN A

01:54:04.370 --> 01:54:05.972
MURDER FOR HIRE PLOT AGAINST AN

01:54:06.039 --> 01:54:07.907
IRANIAN JOURNALIST, A TEXTBOOK

01:54:07.974 --> 01:54:09.108
CASE OF TRANSNATIONAL

01:54:09.175 --> 01:54:10.944
REPRESSION. UNFORTUNATELY, THESE

01:54:11.010 --> 01:54:12.145
THREATS ARE FAR MORE COMMON THAN

01:54:12.212 --> 01:54:14.380
MOST PEOPLE REALIZE. CALIFORNIA

01:54:14.447 --> 01:54:16.649
IS HOME TO MORE THAN 125,000

01:54:16.716 --> 01:54:18.918
TORTURE SURVIVORS, MORE THAN ANY

01:54:18.985 --> 01:54:21.154
OTHER STATE. MANY FLED REGIMES

01:54:21.221 --> 01:54:23.289
THAT PUNISH FREE EXPRESSION WITH

01:54:23.356 --> 01:54:25.024
PRISON OR WORSE. AND EVEN HERE,

01:54:25.091 --> 01:54:27.227
THEY AREN'T ALWAYS SAFE. VICTIMS

01:54:27.293 --> 01:54:28.595
OFTEN STAY SILENT OUT OF FEAR OF

01:54:28.661 --> 01:54:30.496
LAW ENFORCEMENT, IMMIGRATION

01:54:30.563 --> 01:54:31.831
CONSEQUENCES, OR BECAUSE OF

01:54:31.898 --> 01:54:34.300
TRAUMA. THAT'S WHY SB 509 IS SO

01:54:34.367 --> 01:54:36.569
IMPORTANT. THE BILL PROVIDES

01:54:36.636 --> 01:54:38.037
TRAINING FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO

01:54:38.104 --> 01:54:39.839
RECOGNIZE AND RESPOND TO

01:54:39.906 --> 01:54:40.907
TRANSNATIONAL REPRESSION. IT

01:54:40.974 --> 01:54:41.908
HELPS ENSURE IMMIGRANT

01:54:41.975 --> 01:54:42.575
COMMUNITIES CAN ACCESS

01:54:42.642 --> 01:54:45.979
PROTECTION AND SUPPORT WITHOUT

01:54:46.045 --> 01:54:46.913
FEAR. I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT SB

01:54:46.980 --> 01:54:49.849
509. CHAIR AND MEMBERS, GOOD

01:54:49.916 --> 01:54:50.783
AFTERNOON, JONATHAN FELDMAN WITH

01:54:50.850 --> 01:54:52.652
THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS

01:54:52.719 --> 01:54:55.788
ASSOCIATION. I WANT TO BE CANDID

01:54:55.855 --> 01:54:58.491
AND ADMIT THAT THERE LACKS

01:54:58.558 --> 01:55:00.026
THERE'S A SERIOUS LACK OF

01:55:00.093 --> 01:55:01.127
UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHAT THESE

01:55:01.194 --> 01:55:02.562
SITUATIONS ARE, AND THEY'RE

01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:05.698
INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED TYPES OF

01:55:05.765 --> 01:55:07.100
EVENTS THAT, YOU KNOW, EVEN

01:55:07.166 --> 01:55:09.035
AMONGST POLICE CHIEFS, THEY

01:55:09.102 --> 01:55:10.737
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS,

01:55:10.803 --> 01:55:12.372
WHAT TO LOOK FOR, THE SIGNS, THE

01:55:12.438 --> 01:55:13.773
FACTORS BEHIND IT. AND SO WE

01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:14.941
REALLY DO THINK THAT THERE

01:55:15.008 --> 01:55:17.176
SHOULD BE SOME KIND OF STATEWIDE

01:55:17.243 --> 01:55:18.711
CONSISTENT TRAINING TO BE ABLE

01:55:18.778 --> 01:55:20.246
TO IDENTIFY, YOU KNOW, WHEN

01:55:20.313 --> 01:55:21.948
YOU'RE DEALING WITH THIS TYPE OF

01:55:22.015 --> 01:55:23.883
A SITUATION. AND SO I THINK THAT

01:55:23.950 --> 01:55:25.451
THE BILL IS IMPORTANT IN THAT

01:55:25.518 --> 01:55:28.354
REGARD. AND THEN I WANT TO SAY

01:55:28.421 --> 01:55:29.489
TO I KNOW THAT THERE ARE GROUPS

01:55:29.555 --> 01:55:31.291
THAT HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE

01:55:31.357 --> 01:55:32.392
IMPLEMENTATION AND HOW THIS

01:55:32.458 --> 01:55:33.826
TRAINING ENDS UP BEING PRESENTED

01:55:33.893 --> 01:55:34.694
TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. I HAVE HAD A

01:55:34.761 --> 01:55:37.697
CHANCE TO TALK TO SOME OF THOSE

01:55:37.764 --> 01:55:38.765
ORGANIZATIONS OVER THE LAST FEW

01:55:38.831 --> 01:55:40.600
WEEKS, AND REMAIN COMMITTED TO

01:55:40.667 --> 01:55:41.668
CONTINUING THOSE CONVERSATIONS.

01:55:41.734 --> 01:55:43.002
SHOULD THIS BILL GO THROUGH AND

01:55:43.069 --> 01:55:44.570
BE SIGNED INTO LAW, ENSURE THAT

01:55:44.637 --> 01:55:45.772
THE TRAINING THAT IS PRODUCED

01:55:45.838 --> 01:55:48.107
FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT IS BALANCED

01:55:48.174 --> 01:55:49.942
DOES REPRESENT ALL OF THOSE

01:55:50.009 --> 01:55:51.477
VARIOUS POINTS OF OPINION AND

01:55:51.544 --> 01:55:53.279
CONCERNS AND ISSUES, BECAUSE,

01:55:53.346 --> 01:55:54.981
AGAIN, IT IS VERY, VERY

01:55:55.048 --> 01:55:56.516
COMPLICATED TO TRY AND

01:55:56.582 --> 01:55:57.917
UNDERSTAND AND WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:55:57.984 --> 01:55:59.352
THAT THE INFORMATION THAT WE

01:55:59.419 --> 01:56:01.120
PRESENT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT IS

01:56:01.187 --> 01:56:02.989
VERY BALANCED AND USEFUL AND

01:56:03.056 --> 01:56:05.491
HELPFUL, AND FOR THOSE REASONS,

01:56:05.558 --> 01:56:06.659
STRONGLY SUPPORT THE BILL. ASK

01:56:06.726 --> 01:56:09.562

AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR WITNESSES

01:56:11.698 --> 01:56:13.766
FOR THEIR TESTIMONY. WITH THAT,

01:56:13.833 --> 01:56:16.302
I DO BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE

01:56:16.369 --> 01:56:18.371
PRIMARY WITNESSES REGISTERED IN

01:56:18.438 --> 01:56:21.341
OPPOSITION. WE'D LIKE TO INVITE

01:56:21.407 --> 01:56:27.046
PUSHPITA PRASAD AND SAMIR KALRA

01:56:27.113 --> 01:56:35.088

01:56:35.154 --> 01:56:49.802

01:56:49.869 --> 01:56:51.504
GOOD AFTERNOON, MADAM CHAIR AND

01:56:51.571 --> 01:56:52.705

SAMIR AND I'M A CIVIL RIGHTS

01:56:54.107 --> 01:56:55.174
ATTORNEY AND MANAGING DIRECTOR

01:56:55.241 --> 01:56:56.676
FOR THE HINDU AMERICAN

01:56:56.743 --> 01:56:57.977
FOUNDATION. I WANT TO START BY

01:56:58.044 --> 01:56:59.579
THANKING SENATOR CABALLERO AND

01:56:59.645 --> 01:57:00.913
HER STAFF FOR THE CONSTRUCTIVE

01:57:00.980 --> 01:57:02.382
DIALOG ON THIS BILL, AND FOR

01:57:02.448 --> 01:57:04.117
SOME OF THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS

01:57:04.183 --> 01:57:05.518
THAT HAVE BEEN MADE THUS FAR. WE

01:57:05.585 --> 01:57:07.353
ALSO APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S

01:57:07.420 --> 01:57:08.721
SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS THAT REMOVE

01:57:08.788 --> 01:57:11.023
VAGUE TERMS SUCH AS PROXY,

01:57:11.090 --> 01:57:12.125
ADDING CLARIFICATION ON THE

01:57:12.191 --> 01:57:13.626
PROTECTION OF FIRST AMENDMENT

01:57:13.693 --> 01:57:15.328
RIGHTS AND ENSURING THAT THE

01:57:15.395 --> 01:57:17.196
TIMELINE FOR IMPLEMENTATION IS

01:57:17.263 --> 01:57:18.831
BEING EXTENDED. WE BELIEVE,

01:57:18.898 --> 01:57:20.032
HOWEVER, THAT THE AMENDMENTS DO

01:57:20.099 --> 01:57:21.901
NOT GO FAR ENOUGH IN ENSURING

01:57:21.968 --> 01:57:23.169
THAT ANY MANDATED TRAININGS FOR

01:57:23.236 --> 01:57:24.971
LAW ENFORCEMENT ON TRANSNATIONAL

01:57:25.037 --> 01:57:27.306
REPRESSION ARE IMPLEMENTED IN AN

01:57:27.373 --> 01:57:28.174
UNBIASED MANNER AND ARE NOT

01:57:28.241 --> 01:57:29.776
WEAPONIZED AGAINST ANY

01:57:29.842 --> 01:57:31.144
COMMUNITY. BEFORE MAKING A

01:57:31.210 --> 01:57:33.646
DECISION ESTIMATED TO COST

01:57:33.713 --> 01:57:35.448
$905,000, CREATE FOUR NEW

01:57:35.515 --> 01:57:36.849
POSITIONS AND IMPOSE VAGUE

01:57:36.916 --> 01:57:38.684
REQUIREMENTS ON LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:57:38.751 --> 01:57:40.253
AGENCIES. WE NEED TO TAKE A STEP

01:57:40.319 --> 01:57:41.487
BACK AND FURTHER STUDY THE

01:57:41.554 --> 01:57:43.122
ISSUE, GIVEN THAT THERE ARE

01:57:43.189 --> 01:57:44.891
STILL MANY MORE CRITICAL

01:57:44.957 --> 01:57:46.859
QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS WITH THIS

01:57:46.926 --> 01:57:49.529
BILL, WE URGE YOU TO NOT PASS IT

01:57:49.595 --> 01:57:50.129
TODAY. SPECIFICALLY, THERE IS

01:57:50.196 --> 01:57:51.597
STILL A GREAT DEAL OF

01:57:51.664 --> 01:57:53.132
UNCERTAINTY IN HOW THESE

01:57:53.199 --> 01:57:54.167
TRAININGS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED.

01:57:54.233 --> 01:57:56.002
WHO WILL ALWAYS CONSULT WITH TO

01:57:56.068 --> 01:57:56.602
DEVELOPING THE CURRICULUM FOR

01:57:56.669 --> 01:57:58.838
SUCH TRAININGS? ARE THERE EVEN

01:57:58.905 --> 01:58:00.673
ANY EXISTING CONSULTANTS ON

01:58:00.740 --> 01:58:01.607
TRANSNATIONAL OPPRESSION THAT

01:58:01.674 --> 01:58:02.742
CAN BE USED, OR THAT LOCAL

01:58:02.809 --> 01:58:04.143
POLICE DEPARTMENTS WILL BE ABLE

01:58:04.210 --> 01:58:06.379
TO HIRE? WHO ARE THE IMPACTED

01:58:06.446 --> 01:58:07.847
DIASPORA COMMUNITIES THAT LAW

01:58:07.914 --> 01:58:09.682
ENFORCEMENT MUST REACH OUT TO

01:58:09.749 --> 01:58:11.484
DEVELOP TRAININGS AS REQUIRED IN

01:58:11.551 --> 01:58:13.386
SECTION 2B6 OF THE BILL, AND

01:58:13.453 --> 01:58:15.188
WHAT WILL BE THE PROCESS TO

01:58:15.254 --> 01:58:16.923
DECIDE THAT? HOW WILL WE ENSURE

01:58:16.989 --> 01:58:18.558
THAT A DIVERSITY OF GROUPS WILL

01:58:18.624 --> 01:58:19.926
BE APPROACHED, AND NOT ONLY ONES

01:58:19.992 --> 01:58:21.160
THAT ARE PUSHING A SPECIFIC

01:58:21.227 --> 01:58:23.629
POLITICAL AGENDA, AND WHO WILL

01:58:23.696 --> 01:58:24.730
DETERMINE THE SPECIFIC COUNTRIES

01:58:24.797 --> 01:58:26.165
THAT ENGAGE IN TRANSNATIONAL

01:58:26.232 --> 01:58:27.366
OPPRESSION MOST FREQUENTLY FOR

01:58:27.433 --> 01:58:29.902
THE TRAINING, CLARITY ON THESE

01:58:29.969 --> 01:58:31.604
QUESTIONS IS NECESSARY IN ORDER

01:58:31.671 --> 01:58:33.439
TO PREVENT OAS TRAININGS ON

01:58:33.506 --> 01:58:34.407
TRANSNATIONAL OPPRESSION FROM

01:58:34.474 --> 01:58:36.742
BEING POLITICIZED, OR FROM

01:58:36.809 --> 01:58:37.777
INSTITUTIONALIZING BIASES

01:58:37.844 --> 01:58:39.178
AGAINST DIASPORA COMMUNITIES

01:58:39.245 --> 01:58:40.980
FROM SPECIFIC COUNTRIES OF

01:58:41.047 --> 01:58:42.415
ORIGIN, OR WITH SPECIFIC

01:58:42.482 --> 01:58:44.283
VIEWPOINTS ON GEOPOLITICAL

01:58:44.350 --> 01:58:45.618
ISSUES. ACCORDINGLY, I

01:58:45.685 --> 01:58:46.853
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO

01:58:46.919 --> 01:58:48.821
VOTE ON THIS BILL IN ITS CURRENT

01:58:48.888 --> 01:58:51.290
FORM UNTIL FURTHER PROTECTIONS

01:58:51.357 --> 01:58:57.997
AND CLARITY IS ADDED. THANK YOU.

01:58:58.064 --> 01:58:59.732
HI. GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU TO

01:58:59.799 --> 01:59:01.434
THE COMMITTEE FOR HEARING US. MY

01:59:01.501 --> 01:59:02.969
NAME IS PUSHPITA PRASAD. I'M A

01:59:03.035 --> 01:59:04.704
BOARD MEMBER AT THE COALITION OF

01:59:04.770 --> 01:59:06.506
HINDUS OF NORTH AMERICA, KONA.

01:59:06.572 --> 01:59:08.341
I'M HERE TO REGISTER OUR

01:59:08.407 --> 01:59:10.543
OPPOSITION TO SB 509. AS IT

01:59:10.610 --> 01:59:12.712
STANDS TODAY. IT'S A CLEANED UP

01:59:12.778 --> 01:59:15.181
VERSION OF THE FAILED BILL, AB

01:59:15.248 --> 01:59:16.983
307 FROM LAST YEAR. SINCE THAT

01:59:17.049 --> 01:59:19.051
BILL FAILED LAST YEAR, THEY HAVE

01:59:19.118 --> 01:59:20.720
BEEN VANDALISM ATTACKS ON TWO

01:59:20.786 --> 01:59:22.755
NEW CALIFORNIA HINDU TEMPLES,

01:59:22.822 --> 01:59:24.590
BRINGING IT TO A TOTAL OF FOUR

01:59:24.657 --> 01:59:26.425
HINDU TEMPLES IN 14 MONTHS IN

01:59:26.492 --> 01:59:27.793
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS

01:59:27.860 --> 01:59:30.596
AND OTHER AUGUST BODIES HAVE NOT

01:59:30.663 --> 01:59:33.099
CONDEMNED ANY OF THESE ATTACKS

01:59:33.165 --> 01:59:34.500
PUBLICLY. AND IN OUR

01:59:34.567 --> 01:59:35.902
CONVERSATIONS, MANY LAWMAKERS

01:59:35.968 --> 01:59:37.436
WERE NOT EVEN AWARE OF THESE

01:59:37.503 --> 01:59:39.505
ATTACKS. THE SAME GOES FOR THE

01:59:39.572 --> 01:59:40.673
POLICE. THE ATTACKS ON OUR

01:59:40.740 --> 01:59:42.742
TEMPLES WERE NOT OBVIOUSLY

01:59:42.808 --> 01:59:44.043
ANTI-HINDU. THEY DID NOT PASTE.

01:59:44.110 --> 01:59:45.912
THEY DID NOT PAY A HAKENKREUZ ON

01:59:45.978 --> 01:59:47.513
A SYNAGOGUE OR PORTRAYED THAT

01:59:47.580 --> 01:59:48.948
ONE GOD WAS SUPERIOR TO ANOTHER.

01:59:49.015 --> 01:59:51.450
NO, THE GRAFFITI WAS ANTI-INDIA

01:59:51.517 --> 01:59:53.252
ANTI-MODI CLEARLY IMPLYING THAT

01:59:53.319 --> 01:59:55.421
THE CONGREGANTS OF THESE TEMPLES

01:59:55.488 --> 01:59:56.722
ARE PROXIES FOR THE INDIAN

01:59:56.789 --> 01:59:58.291
GOVERNMENTS, AND THUS SEEN AS

01:59:58.357 --> 02:00:00.393
WORTHY TARGETS BY THE

02:00:00.459 --> 02:00:01.494
TRANSNATIONAL TERROR

02:00:01.561 --> 02:00:02.929
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE TARGETING

02:00:02.995 --> 02:00:04.697
US. THAT IS WHY WE OPPOSE THIS

02:00:04.764 --> 02:00:07.266
BILL. WE KNOW HOW IT PLAYS OUT

02:00:07.333 --> 02:00:09.135
HERE. HINDUS IN CALIFORNIA, MANY

02:00:09.201 --> 02:00:10.469
OF THEM ARE LEGAL IMMIGRANTS,

02:00:10.536 --> 02:00:12.271
BUT NOT YET AMERICANS. AND WHEN

02:00:12.338 --> 02:00:13.673
THEY VISIT THEIR TEMPLE, THEY

02:00:13.739 --> 02:00:15.374
ARE SORT OF GETTING A WARNING

02:00:15.441 --> 02:00:16.642
THAT THEY ARE NOW TAINTED BY

02:00:16.709 --> 02:00:19.145
DUAL LOYALTY. THIS BILL WOULD

02:00:19.211 --> 02:00:21.314
GIVE THE FORCE OF LAW TO THIS

02:00:21.380 --> 02:00:23.082
THREAT THAT WE HAVE BEEN FACING.

02:00:23.149 --> 02:00:24.884
WE ARE ALSO DISAPPOINTED BY THE

02:00:24.951 --> 02:00:26.118
PROCESS, EVEN THOUGH WE'VE SEEN

02:00:26.185 --> 02:00:27.954
SOME ENGAGEMENT. BUT IT'S BEEN

02:00:28.020 --> 02:00:29.922
VERY HARD TO ENGAGE, AND MANY OF

02:00:29.989 --> 02:00:31.857
OUR REASONABLE AMENDMENTS, SOME

02:00:31.924 --> 02:00:33.559
OF THE CRITICAL AMENDMENTS HAVE

02:00:33.626 --> 02:00:36.862
BEEN REJECTED. OUR EFFORTS TO

02:00:36.929 --> 02:00:38.364
AND THIS IS NOT AN ABERRATION,

02:00:38.431 --> 02:00:39.999
OUR EFFORTS TO ENGAGE IN

02:00:40.066 --> 02:00:41.400
PRODUCTIVE DIALOG WITH THE

02:00:41.467 --> 02:00:43.703
LEGISLATIVE BODY HAVE OFTEN BEEN

02:00:43.769 --> 02:00:45.571
REBUFFED. OUR REQUESTS FOR

02:00:45.638 --> 02:00:46.839
MEETINGS TO LEGISLATIVE MATTERS

02:00:46.906 --> 02:00:50.176
ARE HARD TO GET, AND OVERALL, WE

02:00:50.242 --> 02:00:52.211
LACK THE KIND OF PRIVILEGED

02:00:52.278 --> 02:00:54.413
ACCESS TO INSTITUTIONAL

02:00:54.480 --> 02:00:55.548
AUTHORITY THAT THE PEOPLE

02:00:55.615 --> 02:00:56.983
PUSHING FOR THIS BILL HAVE BEEN

02:00:57.049 --> 02:00:58.851
HAVE BEEN GETTING. WE ASKED FOR

02:00:58.918 --> 02:01:01.053
AN AMENDMENT TO ENSURE DIVERSITY

02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:02.722
IN THE CULTURAL COMPETENCY

02:01:02.788 --> 02:01:04.156
CLAUSE THAT THIS BILL WANTS TO

02:01:04.223 --> 02:01:06.626
CREATE. THIS WAS REJECTED. THIS

02:01:06.692 --> 02:01:08.160
REINFORCES OUR FEAR THAT THE

02:01:08.227 --> 02:01:10.262
INTENT OF THE BILL IS TO CREATE

02:01:10.329 --> 02:01:12.264
BIAS IN THE LAW, AND TO ELEVATE

02:01:12.331 --> 02:01:14.166
SOME PREFERRED VOICES IN THE

02:01:14.233 --> 02:01:15.701
DIASPORA COMMUNITY WHILE

02:01:15.768 --> 02:01:17.336
SUPPRESSING OTHERS. YOU GUYS,

02:01:17.403 --> 02:01:18.938
EVERYBODY KNOWS IMMIGRANT

02:01:19.005 --> 02:01:19.872
COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA ARE

02:01:19.939 --> 02:01:22.141
UNDER EXTREME STRESS RIGHT NOW,

02:01:22.208 --> 02:01:24.276
AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED

02:01:24.343 --> 02:01:25.778
GUIDELINES TO ENSURE THAT THEY

02:01:25.845 --> 02:01:27.246
DO NOT FACE PERSECUTION FOR

02:01:27.313 --> 02:01:28.614
SIMPLY EXERCISING THEIR FIRST

02:01:28.681 --> 02:01:29.982
AMENDMENT RIGHTS. THE BILL

02:01:30.049 --> 02:01:31.717
IGNORES OBJECTIONS FROM MULTIPLE

02:01:31.784 --> 02:01:33.386
FAITH COMMUNITIES DISTRICT

02:01:33.452 --> 02:01:34.754
ATTORNEYS. IT SUPPRESSES REAL

02:01:34.820 --> 02:01:36.155
CONCERNS ABOUT VIOLENCE WHILE

02:01:36.222 --> 02:01:37.957
DIVIDING IMMIGRANTS. I'M

02:01:38.024 --> 02:01:39.091
TERRIFIED OF THE FUTURE THIS

02:01:39.158 --> 02:01:41.794
BILL WOULD BRING, AND I ASK YOU

02:01:41.861 --> 02:01:44.397
TO VOTE NO IN ITS CURRENT FORM.

02:01:44.463 --> 02:01:45.531
THANK YOU. THANK YOU AGAIN. I'D

02:01:45.598 --> 02:01:48.067
LIKE TO THANK THE SENATOR, THE

02:01:48.134 --> 02:01:50.236

AS THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION

02:01:52.438 --> 02:01:54.173
TO THIS BILL. AT THIS POINT,

02:01:54.240 --> 02:01:56.075
WE'RE GOING TO OPEN IT UP. IS

02:01:56.142 --> 02:01:58.611
THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO

02:01:58.678 --> 02:02:01.047

PLEASE JOIN US AT THE MICROPHONE

02:02:02.314 --> 02:02:04.984

CHAIR AND MEMBERS. MY NAME IS

02:09:57.723 --> 02:09:59.858
TOOLS TO INTERCONNECT BETWEEN

02:09:59.925 --> 02:10:01.593
AGENCIES SO THAT WE PROPERLY

02:10:01.660 --> 02:10:03.128
DETECT AND HOLD PEOPLE

02:10:03.195 --> 02:10:04.196
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE DRUGS THAT

02:10:04.263 --> 02:10:06.832
ARE DESTROYING OUR COMMUNITIES.

02:10:06.899 --> 02:10:08.867
AS AN ADDICTION DOC THAT WAS ON

02:10:08.934 --> 02:10:10.202
THE FRONT LINES OF FENTANYL, I

02:10:10.269 --> 02:10:12.804
HAVE SEEN HOW FENTANYL HAS

02:10:12.871 --> 02:10:14.740
DESTROYED OUR COMMUNITIES COMING

02:10:14.806 --> 02:10:16.708
IN FROM NOT JUST OUR BORDER, BUT

02:10:16.775 --> 02:10:18.210
FROM OUR PORTS AS WELL, COMING

02:10:18.277 --> 02:10:20.145
FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS THAT

02:10:20.212 --> 02:10:22.581
ARE SENDING IT OVER INTO OUR

02:10:22.648 --> 02:10:24.683
COUNTRY, THE INTERNATIONAL GANG

02:10:24.750 --> 02:10:26.451
UNITS THAT ARE TAKING OVER OUR

02:10:26.518 --> 02:10:32.624
STREETS. THERE IS A REAL THREAT

02:10:32.691 --> 02:10:34.760
TO AMERICANS FROM FOREIGN,

02:10:34.826 --> 02:10:36.562
FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE

02:10:36.628 --> 02:10:38.363
TRYING TO DESTROY OUR COUNTRY.

02:10:38.430 --> 02:10:41.366
AT THE SAME TIME, OUR WITNESS

02:10:41.433 --> 02:10:42.768
THAT WAS SPEAKING UP IN

02:10:42.834 --> 02:10:44.836
IMMIGRANTS ADVOCACY, IT'S A VERY

02:10:44.903 --> 02:10:46.405
SCARY TIME TO BE AN IMMIGRANT

02:10:46.471 --> 02:10:49.208
RIGHT NOW. HOW DO WE HOLD PEOPLE

02:10:49.274 --> 02:10:51.710
ACCOUNTABLE AND AT THE SAME TIME

02:10:51.777 --> 02:10:53.845
HAVE EMPATHY AND COMPASSION FOR

02:10:53.912 --> 02:10:55.514
IMMIGRANTS? I AM THE DAUGHTER OF

02:10:55.581 --> 02:10:56.748
TWO IMMIGRANTS THAT ESCAPED

02:10:56.815 --> 02:10:59.251
PERSECUTION FROM A COUNTRY, AND

02:10:59.318 --> 02:11:02.087
THEY CAME HERE AND I WAS ABLE TO

02:11:02.154 --> 02:11:03.121
HAVE THOSE FREEDOMS THAT THEY

02:11:03.188 --> 02:11:05.824
WERE NOT ABLE TO HAVE. AND THANK

02:11:05.891 --> 02:11:09.595
YOU SO MUCH FOR LIFTING THIS AND

02:11:09.661 --> 02:11:11.430
PROTECTING IMMIGRANTS AND

02:11:11.496 --> 02:11:12.931
PROTECTING THEIR FREEDOM OF

02:11:12.998 --> 02:11:15.100
SPEECH. AND AT THE SAME TIME,

02:11:15.167 --> 02:11:16.535
WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT TO

02:11:16.602 --> 02:11:19.004
HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE THAT ARE

02:11:19.071 --> 02:11:21.273
DESTROYING OUR YOUTH WITH

02:11:21.340 --> 02:11:22.608
INTERNATIONAL GANG AND DRUG

02:11:22.674 --> 02:11:23.875
TRAFFICKING. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

02:11:23.942 --> 02:11:27.679
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SENATOR.

02:11:27.746 --> 02:11:30.716
ASSEMBLY MEMBER TAMAYO, THANK

02:11:30.782 --> 02:11:32.284
YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL

02:11:32.351 --> 02:11:34.586
FORWARD. I THINK THAT THE INTENT

02:11:34.653 --> 02:11:38.156
IS LAUDABLE, AND I'M ALWAYS IN

02:11:38.223 --> 02:11:40.993
FAVOR OF PROVIDING MORE TRAINING

02:11:41.059 --> 02:11:43.495
RESOURCES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT.

02:11:43.562 --> 02:11:47.432
HAVE WE GOTTEN A SENSE OF THE

02:11:47.499 --> 02:11:47.866
COST ASSOCIATED WITH

02:11:47.933 --> 02:11:48.500
IMPLEMENTING THE REQUIREMENTS OF

02:11:48.567 --> 02:11:51.503
THIS BILL? THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

02:11:51.570 --> 02:11:53.572
WORKING ON, IS TRYING TO GET

02:11:53.639 --> 02:11:56.375
GOOD COSTS. QUITE FRANKLY, A LOT

02:11:56.441 --> 02:11:56.975
OF THE INFORMATION WILL COME

02:11:57.042 --> 02:11:59.311
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

02:11:59.378 --> 02:12:01.179
THEY'RE THE ONES THAT HAVE THE

02:12:01.246 --> 02:12:04.750
EXPERIENCE WITH INTERNATIONAL.

02:12:04.816 --> 02:12:07.686
ISSUES. AND WE'RE TRYING TO GET

02:12:07.753 --> 02:12:10.088
A SENSE FOR WHAT IT WILL TAKE.

02:12:10.155 --> 02:12:11.890
THIS REALLY IS TO PROVIDE AN

02:12:11.957 --> 02:12:13.492
OPPORTUNITY FOR LOCAL OFFICERS

02:12:13.558 --> 02:12:16.161
TO KNOW HOW TO HANDLE CONCERNS

02:12:16.228 --> 02:12:19.865
RAISED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

02:12:19.931 --> 02:12:21.667
CONCERNS ABOUT THREATS THAT MAY

02:12:21.733 --> 02:12:25.370
HAVE BEEN MADE. THINGS THEY SEE

02:12:25.437 --> 02:12:27.039
IN THE COMMUNITY RIGHT NOW, THEY

02:12:27.105 --> 02:12:29.308
JUST DON'T HAVE ANY TRAINING AND

02:12:29.374 --> 02:12:30.676
ANYTHING TO DO WITH OTHER

02:12:30.742 --> 02:12:31.810
COUNTRIES OR FOREIGN COUNTRIES

02:12:31.877 --> 02:12:33.612
OR FOREIGN AGENTS COMING OVER.

02:12:33.679 --> 02:12:36.114
THIS WILL GIVE THEM THE ABILITY

02:12:36.181 --> 02:12:37.215
TO UNDERSTAND, COLLECT THE DATA

02:12:37.282 --> 02:12:38.750
AND THEN FORWARD IT TO THE

02:12:38.817 --> 02:12:42.087
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR ANALYSIS

02:12:42.154 --> 02:12:45.791
IS REALLY WHAT IT AMOUNTS TO. SO

02:12:45.857 --> 02:12:47.626
THE COSTS ARE, ARE ARE BEING

02:12:47.693 --> 02:12:49.561
WORKED ON AS WE SPEAK. I AGREE

02:12:49.628 --> 02:12:52.931
WITH YOU THAT OUR BEST APPROACH

02:12:52.998 --> 02:12:54.066
TO IMPLEMENTING A PROGRAM LIKE

02:12:54.132 --> 02:12:55.434
THIS WOULD BE TO WORK

02:12:55.500 --> 02:12:56.568
COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE FEDERAL

02:12:56.635 --> 02:12:59.805
GOVERNMENT. AND I DO KNOW THAT A

02:12:59.871 --> 02:13:01.606
PROGRAM LIKE THIS WOULD

02:13:01.673 --> 02:13:03.408
POTENTIALLY ATTRACT FEDERAL

02:13:03.475 --> 02:13:07.012
GRANTS. UNFORTUNATELY, AS YOU

02:13:07.079 --> 02:13:10.949
WELL KNOW, OUR STATE'S DECISION

02:13:11.016 --> 02:13:13.618
TO DECLARE WAR ON THE FEDERAL

02:13:13.685 --> 02:13:16.688
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WITH SB

02:13:16.755 --> 02:13:19.991
54 MAKES THAT POTENTIAL

02:13:20.058 --> 02:13:22.160
NONEXISTENT. AND THAT'S THAT'S A

02:13:22.227 --> 02:13:24.029
CASUALTY HERE. NOT HAVING THE

02:13:24.096 --> 02:13:26.164
FUNDS, NOT HAVING THE ABILITY TO

02:13:26.231 --> 02:13:27.265
COORDINATE WITH THE FEDERAL

02:13:27.332 --> 02:13:29.368
GOVERNMENT, BECAUSE ON THE ONE

02:13:29.434 --> 02:13:31.136
HAND, THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

02:13:31.203 --> 02:13:32.537
SAYS, OH, WE WANT TO WORK

02:13:32.604 --> 02:13:33.705
TOGETHER COLLABORATIVELY, GIVE

02:13:33.772 --> 02:13:36.608
US MONEY, LET'S WORK TOGETHER.

02:13:36.675 --> 02:13:39.144
AND THEN, ON THE OTHER HAND,

02:13:39.211 --> 02:13:41.213
WE'RE NOT ONLY NOT COORDINATING,

02:13:41.279 --> 02:13:43.315
WE'RE ACTUALLY WEAPONIZING STATE

02:13:43.382 --> 02:13:46.284
TAXPAYER MONEY TO THWART LAW

02:13:46.351 --> 02:13:46.985
ENFORCEMENT. SO IT'S A LITTLE

02:13:47.052 --> 02:13:49.221
BIT OF AN INCONSISTENT OR NOT

02:13:49.287 --> 02:13:50.889
ONLY A LITTLE IT'S A LOT

02:13:50.956 --> 02:13:52.724
INCONSISTENT. AND I THINK WE

02:13:52.791 --> 02:13:55.660
HAVE TO REVISIT THAT THAT FIRST.

02:13:55.727 --> 02:13:56.862
AND THAT WOULD PROBABLY IMPROVE

02:13:56.928 --> 02:13:59.197
OUR ABILITY TO DEAL WITH SOME OF

02:13:59.264 --> 02:13:59.965
THESE ISSUES. SETTING THAT

02:14:00.031 --> 02:14:02.467
ASIDE, THOUGH, THE OPPOSITION IS

02:14:02.534 --> 02:14:06.838
HERE TODAY AND THEY THEY HAVE

02:14:06.905 --> 02:14:08.273
SUGGESTED THAT THEY HAVE

02:14:08.340 --> 02:14:09.441
SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH HOW

02:14:09.508 --> 02:14:10.776
THE BILL IS CURRENTLY

02:14:10.842 --> 02:14:12.177
STRUCTURED. THEY'RE CONCERNED

02:14:12.244 --> 02:14:14.379
ABOUT CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED

02:14:14.446 --> 02:14:15.947
FREEDOMS. THEY SAY THAT THEY'VE

02:14:16.014 --> 02:14:19.718
OFFERED SOME AMENDMENTS. WHAT IS

02:14:19.785 --> 02:14:21.052
YOUR APPETITE, YOUR WILLINGNESS

02:14:21.119 --> 02:14:22.921
TO WORK ON THOSE AMENDMENTS?

02:14:22.988 --> 02:14:25.223
BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE

02:14:25.290 --> 02:14:28.026
OPPOSITION COME ON BOARD IN

02:14:28.093 --> 02:14:31.630
SUPPORT OF THE BILL. AND I'D

02:14:31.696 --> 02:14:33.465
LIKE TO FIRST ASK THE AUTHOR,

02:14:33.532 --> 02:14:34.900
WHAT CAN YOU DO TO MAKE THAT

02:14:34.966 --> 02:14:37.335
HAPPEN? AND SECONDLY, FOR THE

02:14:37.402 --> 02:14:39.237
OPPOSITION, CAN YOU GET TO

02:14:39.304 --> 02:14:41.006
SUPPORTING THIS BILL? BECAUSE I

02:14:41.072 --> 02:14:43.108
THINK THAT WOULD BE A WORTHY

02:14:43.175 --> 02:14:45.076
GOAL. BUT IF THE ANSWER IS NO,

02:14:45.143 --> 02:14:46.178
THERE'S, YOU KNOW, THERE'S JUST

02:14:46.244 --> 02:14:47.712
A FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENT THAT

02:14:47.779 --> 02:14:49.781
I'D LIKE TO KNOW THAT AS WELL.

02:14:49.848 --> 02:14:51.249
SENATOR, MAY I INTERJECT FOR IS

02:14:51.316 --> 02:14:53.885
THAT OKAY? YES. THAT'S FINE.

02:14:53.952 --> 02:14:55.454
OKAY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER TAMAYO, I

02:14:55.520 --> 02:14:56.955
JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:14:57.022 --> 02:14:59.357
YOU HAD CLEAR ANSWERS. SO OUR

02:14:59.424 --> 02:15:01.159
COMMITTEE STAFF DID REACH OUT

02:15:01.226 --> 02:15:03.728
AND WORK TO FIND OUT WHAT THE

02:15:03.795 --> 02:15:05.530
ESTIMATED TOTAL. BECAUSE I WANT

02:15:05.597 --> 02:15:06.631
TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET THE

02:15:06.698 --> 02:15:08.333
ACCURATE ANSWER. SO THE

02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:10.535
ESTIMATED FOR POSITIONS WOULD

02:15:10.602 --> 02:15:15.874
REQUIRE $905,000 TO IMPLEMENT SB

02:15:15.941 --> 02:15:17.709
509, BUT THERE IS ALSO AN

02:15:17.776 --> 02:15:19.544
OPPORTUNITY TO USE THE THREAT

02:15:19.611 --> 02:15:20.612
ASSESSMENT GRANT FUNDING FROM

02:15:20.679 --> 02:15:23.415
CAL OES IF THE DEPARTMENT SO

02:15:23.482 --> 02:15:25.684
CHOOSES TO DO SO. SO I JUST

02:15:25.750 --> 02:15:27.085
WANTED TO ENSURE THAT YOU GOT A

02:15:27.152 --> 02:15:29.621
CLEAR ANSWER, AND THEN WE'LL GO

02:15:29.688 --> 02:15:30.722
AHEAD AND ALLOW SENATOR

02:15:30.789 --> 02:15:31.790
CABALLERO TO RESPOND. AND THEN

02:15:31.857 --> 02:15:34.125
WE'LL ALSO BE HAPPY TO UPDATE

02:15:34.192 --> 02:15:36.461
YOU ON THE EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE

02:15:36.528 --> 02:15:38.263
COMMITTEE AS WELL AS THE

02:15:38.330 --> 02:15:39.698
OPPOSITION, WHICH DID RESULT IN

02:15:39.764 --> 02:15:42.234
SEVERAL AMENDMENTS TO MAKE SURE

02:15:42.300 --> 02:15:45.237
THAT THE BILL IS WORKABLE FOR

02:15:45.303 --> 02:15:46.638
EVERYONE. SO, SENATOR, BACK TO

02:15:46.705 --> 02:15:48.406
YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY

02:15:48.473 --> 02:15:50.876
MUCH, MADAM CHAIR. LET ME JUST

02:15:50.942 --> 02:15:54.779
SAY THAT THAT IF YOU KNOW ME,

02:15:54.846 --> 02:15:56.581
YOU KNOW I WORK THE HECK OUT OF

02:15:56.648 --> 02:16:01.219
MY BILLS. AND WE HAD NUMEROUS

02:16:01.286 --> 02:16:04.155
CONVERSATIONS STAFF DID WITH THE

02:16:04.222 --> 02:16:07.392
OPPOSITION. IT'S MY BELIEF THAT

02:16:07.459 --> 02:16:09.327
FUNDAMENTALLY, NOTHING THAT GETS

02:16:09.394 --> 02:16:10.762
CHANGED IN THE BILL IS GOING TO

02:16:10.829 --> 02:16:12.063
CHANGE THEIR MIND. THEY'RE HERE

02:16:12.130 --> 02:16:14.165
TODAY. YOU CAN ASK THEM THAT

02:16:14.232 --> 02:16:15.400
QUESTION YOURSELF. BUT WE'VE

02:16:15.467 --> 02:16:17.869
TAKEN A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS. WE

02:16:17.936 --> 02:16:20.438
HAVE WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP THE

02:16:20.505 --> 02:16:22.974
BILL LEAN AND CLEAN AND NOT ADD

02:16:23.041 --> 02:16:26.177
A WHOLE BUNCH OF DETAILS TO IT.

02:16:26.244 --> 02:16:29.114
AND IN PARTICULAR, NOT RESTATING

02:16:29.180 --> 02:16:34.686
WHAT IS ALREADY THE LAW. AND SO

02:16:34.753 --> 02:16:36.488
I'M I'M JUST SURPRISED TO HEAR

02:16:36.555 --> 02:16:38.790
THAT WE DIDN'T MEET, THAT WE

02:16:38.857 --> 02:16:44.062
WERE HARD TO GET A OF AND THAT.

02:16:44.129 --> 02:16:46.331
THAT THERE WERE THERE WERE

02:16:46.398 --> 02:16:49.501
ISSUES THAT WE'VE, WE HAVEN'T

02:16:49.568 --> 02:16:50.936
TALKED ABOUT THAT HAVEN'T BEEN

02:16:51.002 --> 02:16:52.437
RAISED, THAT ARE BEING RAISED

02:16:52.504 --> 02:16:54.873
NOW BECAUSE THIS HAS GONE

02:16:54.940 --> 02:16:57.108
THROUGH THE SENATE AND THIS IS

02:16:57.175 --> 02:16:58.543
OUR LAST COMMITTEE HERE IN THE

02:16:58.610 --> 02:17:00.912
ASSEMBLY. AND, AND, AND WE'VE

02:17:00.979 --> 02:17:03.248
REALLY WORKED HARD TO TRY TO GET

02:17:03.315 --> 02:17:06.718
WHAT IS A BALANCE, UNDERSTANDING

02:17:06.785 --> 02:17:10.155
THAT IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES,

02:17:10.221 --> 02:17:11.756
THERE ARE DIFFERENT PEOPLE THAT

02:17:11.823 --> 02:17:14.025
MAY NOT HAVE GOTTEN ALONG WITH

02:17:14.092 --> 02:17:15.860
EACH OTHER AND THAT THAT THAT

02:17:15.927 --> 02:17:20.065
COMES TO THIS COUNTRY. AND, AND

02:17:20.131 --> 02:17:21.633
IT'S IMPORTANT NOT TO PICK

02:17:21.700 --> 02:17:24.102
SIDES, BUT TO SAY IF ANYBODY'S

02:17:24.169 --> 02:17:25.604
GETTING THREATENED, IF ANYBODY

02:17:25.670 --> 02:17:29.474
IS BEING HARASSED, IF ANYBODY IS

02:17:29.541 --> 02:17:31.943
FEELING THAT THEIR SAFETY OR

02:17:32.010 --> 02:17:34.879
THEY'RE IN DANGER OF, OF AN

02:17:34.946 --> 02:17:38.149
ATTACK OR OR OR REPRESSION OF

02:17:38.216 --> 02:17:39.484
ANY KIND, THAT THERE'S A PLACE

02:17:39.551 --> 02:17:41.353
WHERE THEY CAN GO AND THAT PLACE

02:17:41.419 --> 02:17:43.622
IS TO REPORT IT TO THE POLICE SO

02:17:43.688 --> 02:17:46.091
THAT THERE'S AN UNDERSTANDING BY

02:17:46.157 --> 02:17:50.729
THE POLICE SERVICES AVAILABLE

02:17:50.795 --> 02:17:52.564
THAT SOMETHING MAY NEED TO BE

02:17:52.631 --> 02:17:54.366
DONE, THAT, THAT THAT'S

02:17:54.432 --> 02:17:55.767
IMPORTANT TO PROTECT THE

02:17:55.834 --> 02:17:56.901
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE GETTING

02:17:56.968 --> 02:17:58.303
HARASSED AND THREATENED AND THAT

02:17:58.370 --> 02:18:00.472
THERE'S A PLACE TO REPORT IT UP

02:18:00.538 --> 02:18:02.741
THE CHAIN. SO NUMBER ONE IS

02:18:02.807 --> 02:18:04.542
WE'VE MADE A NUMBER OF

02:18:04.609 --> 02:18:09.047
AMENDMENTS. AND NUMBER TWO, IT'S

02:18:09.114 --> 02:18:12.317
MY BELIEF THAT THAT THERE'S NOT

02:18:12.384 --> 02:18:14.786
A REAL INTEREST IN IN, IN THE

02:18:14.853 --> 02:18:18.423
END SUPPORTING THE BILL. BUT I

02:18:18.490 --> 02:18:22.360
COULD BE WRONG. IT LOOKS LIKE A

02:18:22.427 --> 02:18:24.596
YES YOU'D LIKE TO ADD. YEAH.

02:18:24.663 --> 02:18:25.997
THANK YOU. SAMIR KALRA, HINDU

02:18:26.064 --> 02:18:27.832
AMERICAN FOUNDATION FOR THE

02:18:27.899 --> 02:18:29.200
RECORD, I APPRECIATE THE

02:18:29.267 --> 02:18:30.068
AUTHOR'S COMMENTS AND ACTUALLY

02:18:30.135 --> 02:18:32.437
WE HAVE HAD SOME VERY PRODUCTIVE

02:18:32.504 --> 02:18:34.272
CONVERSATIONS, AS I MENTIONED,

02:18:34.339 --> 02:18:35.640
AND THERE WERE SOME VERSIONS

02:18:35.707 --> 02:18:38.209
WHERE WE WERE NOT TOO FAR OFF IN

02:18:38.276 --> 02:18:39.844
TERMS OF SOME MOCKUPS AND SOME

02:18:39.911 --> 02:18:41.780
OTHER DISCUSSIONS ON AMENDMENTS.

02:18:41.846 --> 02:18:42.714
AND WITH THE COMMITTEE'S

02:18:42.781 --> 02:18:44.049
AMENDMENTS. I STILL DON'T

02:18:44.115 --> 02:18:45.016
BELIEVE THAT WE'RE THAT FAR AWAY

02:18:45.083 --> 02:18:47.318
TO MOVING TO A NEUTRAL POSITION

02:18:47.385 --> 02:18:49.154
ON THE BILL, AND WE'D LOVE TO

02:18:49.220 --> 02:18:50.555
CONTINUE TO WORK ON SOME

02:18:50.622 --> 02:18:52.357
ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS TO GET IT

02:18:52.424 --> 02:18:56.327
ACROSS THE FINISH LINE. THAT

02:18:56.394 --> 02:18:59.664
SOUNDS HOPEFUL. OKAY. THANK YOU.

02:18:59.731 --> 02:19:01.966
I THINK I'LL JUST ADD THAT WE

02:19:02.033 --> 02:19:03.835
WANT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE, YOU

02:19:03.902 --> 02:19:04.669
KNOW, WE TALK A LOT ABOUT

02:19:04.736 --> 02:19:06.304
DIASPORA COMMUNITIES. WE

02:19:06.371 --> 02:19:07.672
UNDERSTAND THERE IS DIVERSITY,

02:19:07.739 --> 02:19:09.941
AND WE WANT TO SEE THAT

02:19:10.008 --> 02:19:11.776
DIVERSITY REFLECTED IN THE BILL.

02:19:11.843 --> 02:19:13.445
MAYBE IT GETS A LITTLE MORE

02:19:13.511 --> 02:19:15.714
PRESCRIPTIVE, BUT IT HAS TO BE

02:19:15.780 --> 02:19:16.381
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT SOME

02:19:16.448 --> 02:19:17.782
COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE

02:19:17.849 --> 02:19:19.551
BETTER ACCESS THAN OTHERS. AND

02:19:19.617 --> 02:19:21.886
SO TYPICALLY, IF YOU DON'T GET

02:19:21.953 --> 02:19:22.821
PRESCRIPTIVE, THE ONES THAT ARE

02:19:22.887 --> 02:19:24.556
ALREADY IN WILL BECOME STRONGER

02:19:24.622 --> 02:19:25.857
AND THE ONES THAT ARE OUT ARE

02:19:25.924 --> 02:19:28.993
GOING TO GO OUT FURTHER INTO THE

02:19:29.060 --> 02:19:30.361
COLD. AND WE DON'T WANT THAT TO

02:19:30.428 --> 02:19:34.099
HAPPEN. THANK YOU FOR THAT. DO

02:19:34.165 --> 02:19:37.001
YOU MIND CLARIFYING WHEN YOU SAY

02:19:37.068 --> 02:19:37.936
THAT YOU KNOW THOSE WHO HAVE

02:19:38.002 --> 02:19:39.604
ACCESS, THOSE WHO DON'T? IT WILL

02:19:39.671 --> 02:19:41.106
BE STRONGER. AND THE REASON I

02:19:41.172 --> 02:19:43.007
ASK FOR THAT IS BECAUSE I KNOW

02:19:43.074 --> 02:19:44.509
OUR COMMITTEE PUSHED REALLY HARD

02:19:44.576 --> 02:19:45.577
TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS WAS

02:19:45.643 --> 02:19:47.078
NEUTRAL, NOT SPECIFIC TO ANY

02:19:47.145 --> 02:19:48.747
SPECIFIC DIASPORA. MAKE SURE

02:19:48.813 --> 02:19:50.215
THAT NO MATTER WHAT YOUR

02:19:50.281 --> 02:19:51.649
RELIGIOUS OR ETHNIC BACKGROUND,

02:19:51.716 --> 02:19:54.219
THAT YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO

02:19:54.285 --> 02:19:55.587
BENEFIT FROM THE PROTECTIONS. SO

02:19:55.653 --> 02:19:57.789
I WOULD LOVE IF YOU CAN OFFER

02:19:57.856 --> 02:19:59.891
JUST FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR

02:19:59.958 --> 02:20:02.127
COMMITTEE MEMBERS HERE WHO MAYBE

02:20:02.193 --> 02:20:03.728
DIDN'T ENGAGE IN THOSE DIALOGS

02:20:03.795 --> 02:20:06.064
WITH YOU, CAN YOU DO YOU MIND

02:20:06.131 --> 02:20:08.600
PROVIDING A LITTLE BIT MORE OF

02:20:08.666 --> 02:20:11.369
CONTEXT TO THAT? YEAH, I THINK

02:20:11.436 --> 02:20:12.937
ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE

02:20:13.004 --> 02:20:14.773
WERE DISAPPOINTED THAT WAS

02:20:14.839 --> 02:20:16.407
REJECTED WAS WHEN WE HAD

02:20:16.474 --> 02:20:18.243
SPECIFICALLY SAID DIVERSITY IN

02:20:18.309 --> 02:20:20.512
CULTURAL COMPETENCY. WHY IS THAT

02:20:20.578 --> 02:20:22.413
IMPORTANT? BECAUSE I HAVE FACED

02:20:22.480 --> 02:20:23.381
THIS PERSONALLY. I'VE GONE TO

02:20:23.448 --> 02:20:25.617
I'VE TALKED TO LAWMAKERS, I'VE

02:20:25.683 --> 02:20:27.018
TALKED TO MEDIA, I'VE TALKED TO

02:20:27.085 --> 02:20:28.686
PEOPLE TRYING TO EXPLAIN WHAT

02:20:28.753 --> 02:20:30.255
HAPPENS WHEN OUR TEMPLES GET

02:20:30.321 --> 02:20:31.990
ATTACKED, WHEN A HINDU MAN WALKS

02:20:32.056 --> 02:20:33.892
INTO TACO BELL AND FACES A TEN

02:20:33.958 --> 02:20:35.193
MINUTE VERBAL ASSAULT FROM

02:20:35.260 --> 02:20:36.594
ANOTHER BROWN PERSON, RIGHT. AND

02:20:36.661 --> 02:20:38.196
THEY STRUGGLE BECAUSE THERE IS

02:20:38.263 --> 02:20:40.899
NO BOX THAT THEY CAN NEATLY PUT

02:20:40.965 --> 02:20:43.201
ANTI-HINDU HATE INTO, RIGHT? IS

02:20:43.268 --> 02:20:45.003
IT? THEY ASK ME, IS IT RACISM?

02:20:45.069 --> 02:20:46.838
I'M LIKE, NO, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

02:20:46.905 --> 02:20:47.839
WE'RE FROM THE SAME RACE, RIGHT?

02:20:47.906 --> 02:20:50.408
SO IF WE DON'T HAVE A BOX, WE

02:20:50.475 --> 02:20:51.442
STRUGGLE TO GET OUR STORIES

02:20:51.509 --> 02:20:53.545
ACROSS. IT'S TELLING, AS I

02:20:53.611 --> 02:20:55.346
MENTIONED, THAT FOR, I MEAN, I

02:20:55.413 --> 02:20:57.182
WOULD SAY ONE TEMPLE

02:20:57.248 --> 02:20:59.184
VANDALIZATION IS TOO MUCH FOR IN

02:20:59.250 --> 02:21:00.919
14 MONTHS. AND THE FACT THAT

02:21:00.985 --> 02:21:02.220
MANY PEOPLE HERE DIDN'T KNOW

02:21:02.287 --> 02:21:03.688
ABOUT IT IS TELLING IN ITSELF

02:21:03.755 --> 02:21:05.890
WHO HAS ACCESS, WHO DOESN'T.

02:21:05.957 --> 02:21:07.659
IT'S TELLING THAT 14 MONTHS

02:21:07.725 --> 02:21:09.360
LATER NOBODY HAS BEEN

02:21:09.427 --> 02:21:10.895
PROSECUTED, NO ARRESTS HAVE BEEN

02:21:10.962 --> 02:21:13.698
MADE. IT'S TELLING THAT NO MEDIA

02:21:13.765 --> 02:21:16.134
HAS COVERED THIS AT A HOLISTIC

02:21:16.201 --> 02:21:17.468
LEVEL. WE GET SOME CRIME REPORTS

02:21:17.535 --> 02:21:19.037
WHEN THEY HAPPEN, BUT NOBODY'S

02:21:19.103 --> 02:21:20.038
LOOKED AT IT AND SAID, WOW, WHY

02:21:20.104 --> 02:21:21.840
IS ONE COMMUNITY'S PLACE OF

02:21:21.906 --> 02:21:23.441
WORSHIP COMING UNDER ATTACK OVER

02:21:23.508 --> 02:21:25.877
AND OVER AGAIN? IN THE SAME WAY

02:21:25.944 --> 02:21:28.680
WITH USING ANTI-INDIA ANTI-MODI

02:21:28.746 --> 02:21:29.747
SLOGANS? AND BY THE WAY, ONE OF

02:21:29.814 --> 02:21:31.683
THE TEMPLES ATTACKED IS FROM A

02:21:31.749 --> 02:21:33.718
FAMILY FROM FIJI. SO YOU CAN SEE

02:21:33.785 --> 02:21:35.553
WHY. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE SECOND

02:21:35.620 --> 02:21:37.789
GENERATION, THIRD GENERATION

02:21:37.856 --> 02:21:38.756
HINDUS HERE WHO ARE WORRIED. IT

02:21:38.823 --> 02:21:39.791
DOESN'T EVEN MATTER WHERE

02:21:39.858 --> 02:21:43.294
THEY'RE FROM. THANK YOU FOR

02:21:43.361 --> 02:21:45.396
THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENNETT.

02:21:45.463 --> 02:21:47.498
WE'RE GOING TO I THINK WE GOT

02:21:47.565 --> 02:21:48.867
YOU. HAVE ONE MORE COMMENT YOU

02:21:48.933 --> 02:21:50.401
WANTED TO MAKE, MR. KALRA? YES.

02:21:50.468 --> 02:21:51.369
OKAY. SAMIR, HINDU AMERICAN

02:21:51.436 --> 02:21:52.971
FOUNDATION, FOR THE RECORD, I

02:21:53.037 --> 02:21:53.938
THINK I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY

02:21:54.005 --> 02:21:55.506
THAT THAT SECTION THAT'S BEING

02:21:55.573 --> 02:21:57.976
REFERRED TO IS SECTION 2B6,

02:21:58.042 --> 02:21:59.444
WHERE IT MANDATES CULTURALLY

02:21:59.510 --> 02:22:01.179
COMPETENT OUTREACH TO IMPACTED

02:22:01.246 --> 02:22:02.413
DIASPORA COMMUNITIES. I THINK

02:22:02.480 --> 02:22:04.816
THE REQUEST WOULD BE JUST TO ADD

02:22:04.883 --> 02:22:06.484
DIVERSE, IMPACTED DIASPORA

02:22:06.551 --> 02:22:08.319
COMMUNITIES SO WE CAN ENSURE

02:22:08.386 --> 02:22:10.288
THAT IT IS DONE IN A BALANCED

02:22:10.355 --> 02:22:11.522
MANNER AND THAT MULTIPLE

02:22:11.589 --> 02:22:12.624
COMMUNITIES, THERE'S OUTREACH TO

02:22:12.690 --> 02:22:13.892
MULTIPLE COMMUNITIES, AND IT

02:22:13.958 --> 02:22:15.627
DOESN'T JUST GO TO CERTAIN

02:22:15.693 --> 02:22:16.995
COMMUNITIES THAT ALREADY MAY

02:22:17.061 --> 02:22:19.030
HAVE SOME INROADS WITH OAS OR

02:22:19.097 --> 02:22:20.798
OTHER AGENCIES, AND THAT THERE

02:22:20.865 --> 02:22:22.867
IS A WIDE THERE'S A WIDE REACH

02:22:22.934 --> 02:22:24.502
IN TERMS OF THAT CULTURALLY

02:22:24.569 --> 02:22:25.970
COMPETENT OUTREACH. THANK YOU.

02:22:26.037 --> 02:22:28.907
THANK YOU FOR THAT. ASSEMBLY

02:22:28.973 --> 02:22:31.776
MEMBER BENNETT, I REQUESTED TO

02:22:31.843 --> 02:22:34.312
SPEAK BEFORE THIS DIALOG JUST

TOOK PLACE. AND WHAT I WAS GOING

02:22:37.215 --> 02:22:38.349
TO SAY, AND I'M STILL GOING TO

02:22:38.416 --> 02:22:39.751
SAY, IS I JUST WANTED TO

AND YOUR STAFFS ON BOTH SIDES ON

02:22:51.663 --> 02:22:53.798

02:22:53.865 --> 02:22:55.500
TO MOVE THIS. SO JUST MY

02:22:55.566 --> 02:22:56.634
COMPLIMENTS. THAT'S WHAT GOOD

02:22:56.701 --> 02:22:57.869
GOVERNMENT IS. YOU HAVE TO ROLL

02:22:57.936 --> 02:23:00.471
UP YOUR SLEEVES. YOU HAVE TO

02:23:00.538 --> 02:23:01.105
WORK AT IT. YOU HAVE TO LISTEN

02:23:01.172 --> 02:23:03.041
TO EVERYBODY AND TRY TO DO THE

02:23:03.107 --> 02:23:04.943
BEST YOU CAN. SO MY COMPLIMENTS

THAT. AND JUST IN RESPONSE TO

02:23:13.251 --> 02:23:16.020
WHAT HAS BEEN RAISED, THAT'S THE

02:23:16.087 --> 02:23:17.889
ADDITION OF ONE WORD IS NOT

02:23:17.956 --> 02:23:20.425
SOMETHING THAT THAT THAT I WOULD

02:23:20.491 --> 02:23:22.460
DISAGREE WITH. WE'RE TRYING TO

02:23:22.527 --> 02:23:24.429
MAKE SURE WE HAVE DIVERSITY AND

02:23:24.495 --> 02:23:26.464
CULTURAL COMPETENCY. AND SO THAT

02:23:26.531 --> 02:23:28.232
THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME. BUT I

02:23:28.299 --> 02:23:30.768
WILL I GUESS ONE OF THE

02:23:30.835 --> 02:23:33.304
CHALLENGES WITH TRYING TO EDIT

02:23:33.371 --> 02:23:35.106
THINGS FROM THE DAIS IS THEY ASK

02:23:35.173 --> 02:23:36.808
US NOT TO DO IT, BECAUSE LATER

02:23:36.874 --> 02:23:38.977
ON WE GET IN BIG TROUBLE. BUT

02:23:39.043 --> 02:23:41.980
I'LL WORK WITH THE CHAIR TO TRY

02:23:42.046 --> 02:23:43.848
TO INCLUDE THE WORD THAT YOU

02:23:43.915 --> 02:23:47.018
TALKED ABOUT, WHICH IS DIVERSE

02:23:47.085 --> 02:23:49.354
IN IN AN APPROPRIATE SENTENCE SO

02:23:49.420 --> 02:23:52.724
THAT IT IT MAKES SENSE. AND I

02:23:52.790 --> 02:23:54.559
APPRECIATE THAT THAT

02:23:54.625 --> 02:23:55.693
CLARIFICATION. THAT WAS REALLY

02:23:55.760 --> 02:23:58.229
HELPFUL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU

02:23:58.296 --> 02:23:59.797
CHAIR I'M GOING TO TAKE LIBERTY.

02:23:59.864 --> 02:24:00.932
I NORMALLY DON'T TAKE LIBERTY

02:24:00.999 --> 02:24:02.800
TO, YOU KNOW, SPEAK ABOUT THE

02:24:02.867 --> 02:24:04.936
ENGAGEMENT AND INTERACTION. BUT

02:24:05.003 --> 02:24:06.637
I THINK I REALLY WANT TO FIRST

02:24:06.704 --> 02:24:08.840
OF ALL, THANK ALL OF YOU WHO

02:24:08.906 --> 02:24:11.009
CAME OUT, TOOK YOUR TIME OFF OF

02:24:11.075 --> 02:24:12.243
WORK TO COME AND TO STATE YOUR

02:24:12.310 --> 02:24:13.378
OPPOSITION, TO STATE YOUR

02:24:13.444 --> 02:24:15.013
POSITION, BECAUSE I DO WANT YOU

02:24:15.079 --> 02:24:16.614
TO KNOW THAT WE DO TAKE YOUR

02:24:16.681 --> 02:24:18.716
VOICES VERY SERIOUSLY, AND THAT

02:24:18.783 --> 02:24:21.185
WE DO RESPECT AND WANT TO MAKE

02:24:21.252 --> 02:24:23.021
SURE THAT YOU FEEL THAT YOU HAVE

02:24:23.087 --> 02:24:24.522
BEEN HEARD AS PART OF THIS

02:24:24.589 --> 02:24:26.324
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. SO I DO

02:24:26.391 --> 02:24:28.493
THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. I ALSO

02:24:28.559 --> 02:24:31.696
WANT TO JUST FOR THE PUBLIC

02:24:31.763 --> 02:24:33.131
RECORD, NOTE THAT I DID GET AN

02:24:33.197 --> 02:24:34.932
OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH A GROUP

02:24:34.999 --> 02:24:36.834
FROM THE OPPOSITION, AND BECAUSE

02:24:36.901 --> 02:24:39.270
OF YOUR CONCERNS, THE COMMITTEE

02:24:39.337 --> 02:24:41.072
WAS ABLE TO MEET AND SOME OF THE

02:24:41.139 --> 02:24:42.840
CHANGES WE WERE ABLE TO GET THE

02:24:42.907 --> 02:24:45.043
AUTHOR TO AGREE, TO WHICH I

02:24:45.109 --> 02:24:47.111
THINK THEY WOULD HAVE AGREED TO

02:24:47.178 --> 02:24:47.979
ANYWAY, WAS MAKING SURE THAT WE

02:24:48.046 --> 02:24:49.313
WERE A PROTECTING FIRST

02:24:49.380 --> 02:24:51.382
AMENDMENT RIGHTS AS PART OF

02:24:51.449 --> 02:24:52.850
THIS, AND CLARIFYING THAT THIS

02:24:52.917 --> 02:24:55.153
BILL WOULD NOT SUPERSEDE

02:24:55.219 --> 02:24:57.255
ANYONE'S FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS.

02:24:57.321 --> 02:24:58.289
I'LL TELL YOU, I LEARNED MORE

02:24:58.356 --> 02:24:59.891
ABOUT TRANSNATIONAL REPRESSION.

02:24:59.957 --> 02:25:01.592
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THERE WAS

02:25:01.659 --> 02:25:02.960
SUCH A THING HAPPENING AT SUCH A

02:25:03.027 --> 02:25:04.796
HIGH LEVEL THAT WE NEEDED A

02:25:04.862 --> 02:25:07.665
STATEWIDE BILL. BUT DOING THE

02:25:07.732 --> 02:25:09.133
RESEARCH AND UNDERSTANDING THAT

02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:11.335
THE FBI IS ALSO NOTED, YOU KNOW,

02:25:11.402 --> 02:25:13.805
FROM CHINA, FROM RUSSIA, FROM

02:25:13.871 --> 02:25:14.839
IRAN, UKRAINE, ALL THESE

02:25:14.906 --> 02:25:17.041
DIFFERENT PLACES, THAT THERE IS

02:25:17.108 --> 02:25:18.576
SUCH A THING. WE THOUGHT IT WAS

02:25:18.643 --> 02:25:20.978
REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE IF WE

02:25:21.045 --> 02:25:22.246
WERE OUR COMMITTEE WAS GOING TO

02:25:22.313 --> 02:25:24.048
HEAR THIS BILL, THAT WE MADE

02:25:24.115 --> 02:25:26.451
SURE THAT EVERYONE FELT SAFE

02:25:26.517 --> 02:25:28.986
HERE IN CALIFORNIA THROUGH THIS

02:25:29.053 --> 02:25:31.756
BILL. AND SO ONE OF THE ANOTHER

02:25:31.823 --> 02:25:33.257
PIECE THAT WE ARE CONTINUING TO

02:25:33.324 --> 02:25:35.426
WORK ON IS WHEN YOU'RE TALKING

02:25:35.493 --> 02:25:36.794
ABOUT THE TRAINING, BECAUSE THE

02:25:36.861 --> 02:25:38.062
OPPOSITION DID RAISE CONCERNS,

02:25:38.129 --> 02:25:39.330
WHO'S GOING TO DO THE TRAINING

02:25:39.397 --> 02:25:40.731
AND IS THIS GOING TO BE

02:25:40.798 --> 02:25:42.533
CULTURALLY COMPETENT? SO I

02:25:42.600 --> 02:25:44.502
APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR ACCEPTING

02:25:44.569 --> 02:25:46.838
THE WORD DIVERSE. AND THEN WE

02:25:46.904 --> 02:25:49.874
ALSO ASKED THAT WE CONTINUE TO

02:25:49.941 --> 02:25:53.077
WORK WITH POSTS IN REGARDS TO

02:25:53.144 --> 02:25:54.612
WHAT WILL BE IN THE TRAINING,

02:25:54.679 --> 02:25:58.049
AND THAT THE TRAINING DOES

02:25:58.116 --> 02:25:59.484
COVER, YOU KNOW, A MULTITUDE OF,

02:25:59.550 --> 02:26:02.420

EVERYONE IS REPRESENTED IN THIS

02:26:05.022 --> 02:26:05.957
PARTICULAR TRAINING AND THAT IT

02:26:06.023 --> 02:26:08.426
IS A NEUTRAL TRAINING THAT DOES

02:26:08.493 --> 02:26:10.328
NOT PUT WE DON'T WANT TO

02:26:10.394 --> 02:26:13.564
PARTICIPATE IN PUTTING ANY ONE

02:26:13.631 --> 02:26:15.032
GROUP OVER ANOTHER. WE WANT TO

02:26:15.099 --> 02:26:16.868
MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE IS

02:26:16.934 --> 02:26:18.503
PROTECTED. SO I DO WANT TO JUST

02:26:18.569 --> 02:26:20.872
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE DID MAKE OUR

02:26:20.938 --> 02:26:23.541
BEST EFFORTS TO TRY AND MAKE

02:26:23.608 --> 02:26:25.276
SURE THAT YOU WERE HEARD, AND

02:26:38.723 --> 02:26:40.424
CONTINUE TO WORK TO MAKE SURE

02:26:40.491 --> 02:26:43.027
CULTURAL COMPETENCE IS COVERED.

02:26:43.094 --> 02:26:45.530
WE ALSO HAVE SEEN AND THERE ARE

CURRENTLY GRANTS FOR FOLKS IN

TEMPLES IN PLACES THAT NEED

02:26:49.934 --> 02:26:51.335
ADDITIONAL SECURITY. BUT

ULTIMATELY, WE WANT TO GET TO A

02:26:53.037 --> 02:26:54.839
POINT WHERE THAT'S NOT HAPPENING

02:26:54.906 --> 02:26:56.440
IN OUR STATE, THAT PEOPLE DON'T

02:26:56.507 --> 02:26:57.542
NEED GRANTS FOR SECURITY. AND SO

I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR

02:27:00.044 --> 02:27:01.078
