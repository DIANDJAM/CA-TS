AND I'LL ALSO ADD THAT THE

01:26:27.982 --> 01:26:29.717
MIGRATION ISN'T JUST AN

01:26:29.784 --> 01:26:32.253
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE, IT'S AN

01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:34.022
ECONOMIC ISSUE. MONARCH

01:26:34.088 --> 01:26:35.957
BUTTERFLY SUPPORT ECO TOURISM IN

01:26:36.024 --> 01:26:37.825

THE SHOULDER AND THE WINTER

01:26:39.861 --> 01:26:42.730
SEASONS, AND AS MIGRANTS

01:26:42.797 --> 01:26:43.731
THEMSELVES, WHAT MANY PEOPLE

01:26:43.798 --> 01:26:45.600
DON'T KNOW IS THAT MONARCHS HAVE

01:26:45.667 --> 01:26:48.002
ALSO BECOME A POWERFUL SYMBOL OF

01:26:48.069 --> 01:26:50.004
FREEDOM, OF RESILIENCE AND OF

01:26:50.071 --> 01:26:52.473

URGENT NEED TO CONSERVE MONARCHS

01:27:08.156 --> 01:27:10.158
AND THEIR HABITAT. AND I

01:27:10.224 --> 01:27:11.292
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE

01:27:11.359 --> 01:27:12.827

NATURE'S MOST INCREDIBLE

01:27:27.709 --> 01:27:30.612
TRAVELERS, THE WESTERN MONARCH

01:27:30.678 --> 01:27:32.046

01:27:42.090 --> 01:27:44.192
LITTLE EXTRA ATTENTION TO THESE

01:27:44.258 --> 01:27:46.060
MAGNIFICENT CREATURES, I'VE

01:27:46.127 --> 01:27:48.262
BROUGHT MONARCH BUTTERFLY WINGS

01:27:48.329 --> 01:27:50.765
TO WEAR AS A REMINDER THAT

01:27:50.832 --> 01:27:52.433
PROTECTING MONARCHS TAKES MORE

01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:54.969
THAN WORDS ON PAPER. IT TAKES

01:27:55.036 --> 01:27:57.505
WINGS OF ACTION, LIFTING US ALL

01:27:57.572 --> 01:27:59.774
TOWARD A MORE SUSTAINABLE

01:27:59.841 --> 01:28:02.543
FUTURE. EACH YEAR, THESE TINY

01:28:02.610 --> 01:28:04.779
YET MIGHTY BUTTERFLIES EMBARK ON

01:28:04.846 --> 01:28:07.582

THE MONARCHS. MONARCH

01:28:36.210 --> 01:28:37.612
BUTTERFLIES ARE MORE THAN JUST

01:28:37.679 --> 01:28:39.180
BEAUTIFUL INSECTS FLUTTERING

POWERFUL SYMBOLS OF RESILIENCE,

01:28:44.752 --> 01:28:47.622

OF MIGRATION, CHANGE AND THE

01:28:56.698 --> 01:28:59.767
PURSUIT OF A BETTER LIFE. SADLY,

THEIR NUMBERS HAVE DROPPED BY A

01:29:02.136 --> 01:29:05.273

01:30:02.230 --> 01:30:04.265
COMPARISON TO THE WINGS OF THE

01:30:04.332 --> 01:30:06.501
COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA CRUZ. I

01:30:06.567 --> 01:30:09.036
RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF ACR

01:30:09.103 --> 01:30:11.172
103. I'M PROUD TO REPRESENT THE

01:30:11.239 --> 01:30:13.374
ELWOOD MONARCH GROVE IN MY

01:30:13.441 --> 01:30:14.509
DISTRICT. IT'S ONE OF THE

01:30:14.575 --> 01:30:16.110
LARGEST OVERWINTERING SITES IN

01:30:16.177 --> 01:30:18.012
ALL OF CALIFORNIA, AND EVERY

01:30:18.079 --> 01:30:19.814
YEAR, THOUSANDS OF BUTTERFLIES

01:30:19.881 --> 01:30:22.250

01:30:22.316 --> 01:30:24.085
VISITORS WHO WALK THE MILE AND A

01:30:24.152 --> 01:30:26.254

BREATHTAKING SIGHT OF BRIGHT,

01:30:28.089 --> 01:30:29.791
VIBRANT MONARCH BUTTERFLIES

01:30:29.857 --> 01:30:32.093
CLUSTERING IN THE TREES AND

01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:33.561
FLUTTERING IN THE AIR. AND

01:30:33.628 --> 01:30:35.563
THERE'S A DEEP SENSE OF PRIDE IN

01:30:35.630 --> 01:30:36.464
MY COMMUNITY. IN FACT, THE CITY

01:30:36.531 --> 01:30:38.599
OF GOLETA HAS THE MONARCH

01:30:38.666 --> 01:30:39.734
BUTTERFLY AS THE EMBLEM OF ITS

01:30:39.801 --> 01:30:41.936
CITY SEAL. AND, AS MY COLLEAGUES

01:30:42.003 --> 01:30:43.504
HAVE DESCRIBED, SADLY, THE

01:30:43.571 --> 01:30:45.740
MONARCH POPULATION AT ELWOOD AND

01:30:45.807 --> 01:30:48.409
AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:30:48.476 --> 01:30:49.777
HAS DECLINED DRASTICALLY IN THE

01:30:49.844 --> 01:30:52.547
1960S AND THE 1970S, AS MANY AS

01:30:52.613 --> 01:30:55.082
80,000 MONARCH BUTTERFLIES

01:30:55.149 --> 01:30:56.417
OVERWINTERED IN ELWOOD AND

01:30:56.484 --> 01:30:59.387
GOLETA. LAST YEAR, ONLY 34 WERE

01:30:59.453 --> 01:31:02.290
COUNTED IN THAT SITE. THE

01:31:02.356 --> 01:31:03.658
DEVASTATING LOSS OF MONARCHS IS

01:31:03.724 --> 01:31:05.860
DUE TO HABITAT LOSS,

01:31:05.927 --> 01:31:08.329
OVEREXPOSURE TO PESTICIDES AND

01:31:08.396 --> 01:31:09.997
UNSEASONABLE WEATHER PATTERNS

01:31:10.064 --> 01:31:12.700
WORSENED BY CLIMATE CHANGE. ACR

01:31:14.001 --> 01:31:15.837

01:31:15.903 --> 01:31:17.705
EFFORTS TO REVERSE THESE

01:31:17.772 --> 01:31:19.473
DECLINES. PROTECTING MONARCHS

01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:20.741
MEANS PROTECTING THE HEALTH OF

01:31:20.808 --> 01:31:22.910
OUR ENVIRONMENT, OUR ECOSYSTEMS

01:31:22.977 --> 01:31:25.046
AND OUR WILDLIFE FOR GENERATIONS

01:31:25.112 --> 01:31:26.480
TO COME. I URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR

01:31:26.547 --> 01:31:29.050
THIS IMPORTANT RESOLUTION TO

01:41:07.995 --> 01:41:09.696
OF CHILDREN TO BOARDING SCHOOLS,

01:41:09.763 --> 01:41:10.431
SUPPRESSION OF LANGUAGE AND

01:41:10.497 --> 01:41:12.032
CULTURE, AND THE BREAKING OF

01:41:12.099 --> 01:41:13.534
HUNDREDS OF TREATIES. EACH ONE

01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:16.370
WAS A SOLEMN PROMISE. CALIFORNIA

01:41:16.437 --> 01:41:17.738
TWO BEARS ITS OWN SHAMEFUL ROLE,

01:41:17.805 --> 01:41:19.640
AND AS SUCH, WE MUST NEVER

01:41:19.706 --> 01:41:21.341
FORGET THAT OUR OWN STATE

01:41:21.408 --> 01:41:22.609
SANCTIONED AND EVEN INCENTIVIZED

01:41:22.676 --> 01:41:24.211
THE EXTERMINATION OF NATIVE

01:41:24.278 --> 01:41:27.247
NATIVE PEOPLES. THE

01:41:27.314 --> 01:41:27.915
INTERGENERATIONAL TRAUMA

01:41:27.981 --> 01:41:29.183
INFLICTED BY THESE ATROCITIES

01:41:29.249 --> 01:41:31.518
LIVES ON. WE SEE IT IN THE

01:41:31.585 --> 01:41:33.020
DISPARITIES IN HEALTH, EDUCATION

01:41:33.086 --> 01:41:35.022
AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES IN

01:41:35.088 --> 01:41:36.123
THE MISSING AND MURDERED

01:41:36.190 --> 01:41:37.524
INDIGENOUS PEOPLES EPIDEMIC AND

01:41:37.591 --> 01:41:39.126
IN THE CONTINUED STRUGGLES TO

01:41:39.193 --> 01:41:40.694
PROTECT TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY AND

01:41:40.761 --> 01:41:42.629
SACRED LANDS FROM ERASURE. TO

01:41:42.696 --> 01:41:44.298
MOVE FORWARD, THE FEDERAL

01:41:44.364 --> 01:41:45.065
GOVERNMENT MUST FORMALLY

01:41:45.132 --> 01:41:46.867
CONFRONT THIS TRUTH, INCLUDING A

01:41:46.934 --> 01:41:48.802

01:41:50.571 --> 01:41:52.339
A LONG OVERDUE FIRST STEP

01:41:52.406 --> 01:41:54.241
TOWARDS HEALING. AS LEADERS, WE

01:41:54.308 --> 01:41:55.876
KNOW THAT HEALING BEGINS WITH

01:41:55.943 --> 01:41:56.877
TRUTH TELLING. WE UNDERSTAND

01:41:56.944 --> 01:41:58.378
WHAT IT MEANS TO BE TARGETED,

01:41:58.445 --> 01:42:00.581
SILENCED, AND DENIED DIGNITY. WE

01:42:00.647 --> 01:42:01.849
STAND IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE

01:42:01.915 --> 01:42:03.350

01:43:01.308 --> 01:43:03.143
TO EXPAND LOS ANGELES. WE MUST

01:43:03.210 --> 01:43:04.711
REFLECT ON THESE HISTORICAL

01:43:04.778 --> 01:43:06.146

IN OUR COUNTRY AND OUR STATE ARE

01:45:30.857 --> 01:45:33.427

STEWARDSHIP THAN OTHER

01:46:11.631 --> 01:46:13.400
SPEAKS TO HOW WE CONTINUE TO

HATE AND PERSECUTION OF OUR

02:02:46.992 --> 02:02:49.228
THE FAITH BASED CRISIS PREGNANCY

02:02:49.295 --> 02:02:52.164
CENTERS WHO WERE TOLD BY THIS

02:02:52.231 --> 02:02:55.868
LEGISLATURE IN 2018 THAT YOU

02:02:55.935 --> 02:02:57.570
MUST VIOLATE YOUR RELIGIOUS

02:02:57.636 --> 02:03:00.206
BELIEFS AND PROMOTE THE PRACTICE

02:03:00.272 --> 02:03:01.807
OF ABORTION? I DON'T CARE WHERE

02:03:01.874 --> 02:03:03.476
YOU STAND ON ABORTION, BUT I

02:03:03.542 --> 02:03:05.511
THINK ALL COMMON SENSE, FAIR

02:03:05.578 --> 02:03:08.514
MINDED CALIFORNIANS WOULD SAY

02:03:08.581 --> 02:03:11.617
THAT IT IS NOT A IT IS NOT THE

02:03:11.684 --> 02:03:12.351
ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE OR THIS

02:03:12.418 --> 02:03:15.654
GOVERNOR TO COMPEL CHURCHES TO

02:03:15.721 --> 02:03:18.524
EMBRACE ABORTION WHEN THAT IS A

02:03:18.591 --> 02:03:21.026
FIRMLY HELD RELIGIOUS BELIEF

02:03:21.093 --> 02:03:23.963
THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE. I COULD

02:03:24.029 --> 02:03:26.165
GO INTO COVID, I COULD GO INTO

02:03:26.232 --> 02:03:27.733
THE RECENT FEDERAL COURT CASES

02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:31.370
THAT OVERTURNED VARIOUS BILLS

02:03:31.437 --> 02:03:33.239
PASSED BY THIS LEGISLATURE,

02:03:33.305 --> 02:03:35.775
IMPOSED BY THIS GOVERNOR, THAT

02:03:35.841 --> 02:03:37.510
STRIPPED PARENTS OF THEIR 14TH

02:03:37.576 --> 02:03:39.411
AMENDMENT DUE PROCESS, EQUAL

02:03:39.478 --> 02:03:40.346
PROTECTION RIGHTS UNDER THE

02:03:40.412 --> 02:03:42.882
FEDERAL CONSTITUTION, FIRST YEAR

02:03:42.948 --> 02:03:46.952
LAW STUDENTS READ THE LAWS THAT

02:03:47.019 --> 02:03:47.953
I'VE JUST REFERENCED, AND

02:03:48.020 --> 02:03:50.122
THEY'RE EMBARRASSED A FIRST YEAR

02:03:50.189 --> 02:03:51.590
LAW STUDENT WOULD RECOGNIZE THAT

02:03:51.657 --> 02:03:53.726
THERE IS A CONSTITUTIONAL

02:03:53.793 --> 02:03:55.494
PROBLEM WITH THESE LAWS, BUT

02:03:55.561 --> 02:03:57.062
THIS LEGISLATURE DOESN'T LEARN

02:03:57.129 --> 02:03:59.165
BECAUSE THEY DON'T CARE. THEY

02:03:59.231 --> 02:04:01.367
PASS THE SAME LAWS TIME AND TIME

02:04:01.433 --> 02:04:02.802
AGAIN. WHAT DO THEY DO? THEY

02:04:02.868 --> 02:04:04.603
THEY BASICALLY TELL CALIFORNIA

02:04:04.670 --> 02:04:07.807
CITIZENS TOUGH. WHERE MIGHT

02:04:07.873 --> 02:04:09.608
MAKES RIGHT. YOU'RE GOING TO

02:04:09.675 --> 02:04:10.743
HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THIS LAW.

02:04:10.810 --> 02:04:13.979
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HIRE AN

02:04:14.046 --> 02:04:14.580
ATTORNEY. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE

02:04:14.647 --> 02:04:15.548
TO PAY FOR IT. SUE US, BECAUSE

02:04:15.614 --> 02:04:18.184
AT LEAST FOR THE NEXT 8 TO 12

02:04:18.250 --> 02:04:21.187
MONTHS, WE GET TO DEPRIVE YOU OF

02:04:21.253 --> 02:04:21.754
YOUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.

02:04:21.821 --> 02:04:24.056
YEAH, WE'LL LOSE IN COURT. BUT

02:04:24.123 --> 02:04:27.226
FOR THE NEXT YEAR, WE'VE

02:04:27.293 --> 02:04:29.762
STRIPPED YOU OF YOUR RIGHTS. SO

02:04:29.829 --> 02:04:33.766
AGAIN, I SOMETIMES I, I GO ALONG

02:04:33.833 --> 02:04:35.935
SAYING, I'M GOING TO ASSUME THAT

02:04:36.001 --> 02:04:38.804
THE INTENTION IS WELL FOUNDED ON

02:04:38.871 --> 02:04:40.072
THIS ONE, FOR THIS LEGISLATURE

02:04:40.139 --> 02:04:42.007
TO TRY TO WADE IN ON THE ISSUE

02:04:42.074 --> 02:04:44.977
OF RULE OF LAW. I THINK SILENCE

02:04:45.044 --> 02:04:47.079
IS PROBABLY THE BEST STRATEGY

02:04:47.146 --> 02:04:50.316
AND PERHAPS SOME QUIET

02:04:50.382 --> 02:04:52.084
CONTEMPLATION OF YOUR OWN

02:04:52.151 --> 02:04:56.522
MISDEEDS OVER THE YEARS. THANK

02:04:56.589 --> 02:04:59.692
YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER DE MAYO.

02:04:59.758 --> 02:05:01.393
ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN, YOU ARE

02:05:01.460 --> 02:05:08.267
RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MR.

02:05:08.334 --> 02:05:12.238
SPEAKER. I RISE IN RESPONSE TO

02:05:12.304 --> 02:05:14.707
THE PHÐ OUTRAGE THAT I'VE ONCE

02:05:14.773 --> 02:05:17.376
AGAIN HEARD ON THIS FLOOR, AND I

02:05:17.443 --> 02:05:20.880
FIND IT RICH IN HYPOCRISY,

02:05:20.946 --> 02:05:22.081
CHALLENGING WHO ACTUALLY CARES

02:05:22.147 --> 02:05:24.917
ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW AND WHO

02:05:24.984 --> 02:05:27.052
DOESN'T IN 2025? AND SO

02:05:27.119 --> 02:05:28.888
PERMISSION TO READ JUST A COUPLE

02:05:28.954 --> 02:05:30.055
OF EXAMPLES WITHOUT OBJECTION.

02:05:30.122 --> 02:05:31.357
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THESE ARE

02:05:31.423 --> 02:05:33.525
SOME EXAMPLES FROM THE TRUMP

02:05:33.592 --> 02:05:34.260
ADMINISTRATION IN REGARDS TO

02:05:34.326 --> 02:05:36.128
WHETHER OR NOT THEY THINK THAT

02:05:36.195 --> 02:05:38.530
THEY ARE ABOVE THE RULE OF LAW,

02:05:38.597 --> 02:05:39.865
WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE TO

02:05:39.932 --> 02:05:42.201
FOLLOW DECISIONS BY THE COURTS.

02:05:42.268 --> 02:05:44.303
I WOULD LIKE TO START WITH

02:05:44.370 --> 02:05:46.205
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S BORDER CZAR,

02:05:46.272 --> 02:05:48.173
TOM HOMAN, WHO SAID, I DON'T

02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:50.676
CARE WHAT THE JUDGES THINK, I

02:05:50.743 --> 02:05:54.346
DON'T CARE. VICE PRESIDENT JD

02:05:54.413 --> 02:05:57.616
VANCE SAID JUDGES AREN'T ALLOWED

02:05:57.683 --> 02:05:59.318
TO CONTROL THE EXECUTIVE'S

02:05:59.385 --> 02:06:01.553
LEGITIMATE POWER. AND HE SAID

02:06:01.620 --> 02:06:04.890
FOUR YEARS AGO, WHEN THE COURTS

02:06:04.957 --> 02:06:06.959
STOP, YOU STAND BEFORE THE

02:06:07.026 --> 02:06:09.061
COUNTRY LIKE ANDREW JACKSON DID

02:06:09.128 --> 02:06:10.663
AND SAY THE CHIEF JUSTICE HAS

02:06:10.729 --> 02:06:13.132
MADE HIS RULING. NOW LET HIM

02:06:13.198 --> 02:06:14.566
ENFORCE IT. AND FOR THOSE WHO

02:06:14.633 --> 02:06:16.201
DON'T KNOW, THAT'S A DIRECT

02:06:16.268 --> 02:06:17.069
CHALLENGE TO THE COURTS. THAT'S

02:06:17.136 --> 02:06:18.837
A DIRECT CHALLENGE TO THE RULE

02:06:18.904 --> 02:06:20.406
OF LAW, SAYING LET THE COURTS,

02:06:20.472 --> 02:06:22.007
LET THE SUPREME COURT LET JUDGES

02:06:22.074 --> 02:06:24.977
GET THEIR OWN ARMY TO TRY TO

02:06:25.044 --> 02:06:26.946
CHALLENGE THE PRESIDENT AS THE

02:06:27.012 --> 02:06:28.881
COMMANDER IN CHIEF. AND MIGHT I

02:06:28.948 --> 02:06:30.649
REMIND ALL OF YOU, THERE ARE NO

02:06:30.716 --> 02:06:32.885
KINGS IN AMERICA. THERE ARE NO

02:06:32.952 --> 02:06:34.320
KINGS. WE HAVE A DIVISION OF

02:06:34.386 --> 02:06:35.821
POWER IN THE UNITED STATES IN

02:06:35.888 --> 02:06:37.556
OUR DEMOCRACY. AND THE COURTS

02:06:37.623 --> 02:06:39.692
PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THAT.

02:06:39.758 --> 02:06:41.827
WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY

02:06:41.894 --> 02:06:45.264
CAROLINE LEAVITT SAID THAT WHEN

02:06:45.331 --> 02:06:46.632
QUESTIONED ABOUT COURTS ISSUING

02:06:46.699 --> 02:06:47.967
NATIONWIDE INJUNCTIONS ON

02:06:48.033 --> 02:06:50.202
TRUMP'S ORDERS, SHE RESPONDED

02:06:50.269 --> 02:06:51.904
THEY HAVE NO BASIS IN THE LAW

02:06:51.971 --> 02:06:54.139
AND THAT THE COURTS HAVE NO

02:06:54.206 --> 02:06:56.108
GROUNDS. MARCO RUBIO, SECRETARY

02:06:56.175 --> 02:06:57.910
OF STATE, SAID NO COURT IN THE

02:06:57.977 --> 02:06:59.878
UNITED STATES HAS A RIGHT, HAS A

02:06:59.945 --> 02:07:01.547
RIGHT TO CONDUCT THE FOREIGN

02:07:01.613 --> 02:07:03.749
POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES.

02:07:03.816 --> 02:07:06.752
STEPHEN MILLER, SENIOR ADVISOR

02:07:06.819 --> 02:07:09.588
AND REAL JERK, FOR WHAT IT'S

02:07:09.655 --> 02:07:11.090
WORTH, SAID FEDERAL COURTS HAVE

02:07:11.156 --> 02:07:12.958
BECOME, IN MANY CASES, A SUPREME

02:07:13.025 --> 02:07:15.594
BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. THE POWERS

02:07:15.661 --> 02:07:17.596
OF THE PRESIDENT WILL NOT BE

02:07:17.663 --> 02:07:19.331
QUESTIONED. STEPHEN MILLER,

02:07:19.398 --> 02:07:20.532
ADVISER TO THE PRESIDENT, MIGHT

02:07:20.599 --> 02:07:22.568
AS WELL HAVE SAID THE POWERS OF

02:07:22.634 --> 02:07:24.203
THE KING SHALL NOT BE

02:07:24.269 --> 02:07:26.305
QUESTIONED. THE COURTS EXIST TO

02:07:26.372 --> 02:07:28.040
QUESTION THE POWERS OF THE

02:07:28.107 --> 02:07:31.276
PRESIDENT, BUT MORE AND MORE OF

02:07:31.343 --> 02:07:32.478
TRUMP'S ADVISERS, MORE AND MORE

02:07:32.544 --> 02:07:34.446
OF TRUMP'S ADMINISTRATORS

02:07:34.513 --> 02:07:35.814
CLEARLY SHOW, OH, HERE'S ANOTHER

02:07:35.881 --> 02:07:38.817
ONE. EMIL BOVE, WHO CURRENTLY

02:07:38.884 --> 02:07:40.586
TODAY IS IN THE NOMINATION

02:07:40.652 --> 02:07:43.088
PROCESS TO BECOME A FEDERAL

02:07:43.155 --> 02:07:47.059
JUDGE FOR LIFE, SAID, F YOU. BUT

02:07:47.126 --> 02:07:49.194
HE DIDN'T SAY F, HE SAID, F YOU

02:07:49.261 --> 02:07:51.764
TO THE COURTS IN CONTEXT TO

02:07:51.830 --> 02:07:53.866
CARRYING OUT DEPORTATIONS EVEN

02:07:53.932 --> 02:07:55.734
AGAINST EXPLICIT JUDICIAL

02:07:55.801 --> 02:07:57.102
ORDERS. AND NOW PRESIDENT TRUMP

02:07:57.169 --> 02:07:59.571
THINKS THAT THIS GUY SHOULD BE A

02:07:59.638 --> 02:08:02.808
JUDGE FOR A LIFE TERM. SO IT'S

02:08:02.875 --> 02:08:04.476
EMBARRASSING. IT'S EMBARRASSING.

02:08:04.543 --> 02:08:06.145
WHAT TRUMP, WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

02:08:06.211 --> 02:08:09.014
AND HIS APPOINTEES AND HIS

02:08:09.081 --> 02:08:09.948
ADMINISTRATORS ARE DOING

02:08:10.015 --> 02:08:12.184
TRAMPLING THE RULE OF LAW IN

02:08:12.251 --> 02:08:15.154
AMERICA. AND I'M VERY PROUD TO

RESPECT OUR JUDGES, WE RESPECT

02:08:20.993 --> 02:08:22.361

PATTERSON, YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

02:08:30.936 --> 02:08:32.471
THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. AT FIRST

02:08:32.538 --> 02:08:35.340
I WAS GOING TO TALK ABOUT

02:08:35.407 --> 02:08:38.177
PROPOSITION 35 AND THE

02:08:38.243 --> 02:08:39.945
GOVERNOR'S AND THIS

02:08:40.012 --> 02:08:41.080
LEGISLATURE'S DESIRE TO STEAL

02:08:41.146 --> 02:08:43.248
MONEY FROM SOME OF THE POOREST

02:08:43.315 --> 02:08:44.616
INDIVIDUALS IN THE STATE ON

02:08:44.683 --> 02:08:46.385
MEDI-CAL PROGRAMS AND INSTEAD

02:08:46.452 --> 02:08:48.654
BALANCE THE GENERAL FUND,

02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:50.089
DESPITE WHAT THE VOTERS DIRECTED

02:08:50.155 --> 02:08:51.790
THEM TO DO. AND THEN I THOUGHT,

02:08:51.857 --> 02:08:53.859
WELL, NO, MAYBE I'LL TALK ABOUT

02:08:53.926 --> 02:08:54.726
PROPOSITION 36 AND WHAT THE

02:08:54.793 --> 02:08:57.229
VOTERS ASKED THE PEOPLE OF THE

02:08:57.296 --> 02:08:58.831
LEGISLATURE TO DO AND, AND

02:08:58.897 --> 02:08:59.965
THOUGHT ABOUT HOW THE GOVERNOR

02:09:00.032 --> 02:09:01.500
DIDN'T WANT TO FUND THAT. BUT

02:09:01.567 --> 02:09:04.803
THEN I WAS GIVEN A REAL GEM JUST

02:09:04.870 --> 02:09:06.605

02:09:32.331 --> 02:09:34.700
DESPISE. HOW THAT OUR PRESIDENT

GOVERNOR HAS TAKEN A PAGE RIGHT

02:09:37.970 --> 02:09:40.439
OUT OF THAT. AND ACTUALLY, THAT

02:09:40.506 --> 02:09:43.709
THAT OFFICE IS ENGAGED IN SOME

02:09:43.775 --> 02:09:48.380

INTO OUR CONSTITUTION A

02:10:10.302 --> 02:10:11.103
REDISTRICTING COMMISSION BECAUSE

02:10:11.170 --> 02:10:12.838
THEY DIDN'T TRUST THE

02:10:12.905 --> 02:10:14.006
LEGISLATURE OR THE GOVERNOR TO

02:10:14.072 --> 02:10:16.041
COME UP WITH WHAT THE DISTRICTS

02:10:16.108 --> 02:10:18.210

02:10:29.788 --> 02:10:31.957
LEGISLATURE. CALIFORNIA COULD

02:10:32.024 --> 02:10:34.092
GERRYMANDER LIKE NO OTHER STATE,

02:10:34.159 --> 02:10:35.527
HE SAYS. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN,

02:10:35.594 --> 02:10:37.129
QUOTE UNQUOTE, PLAYING FAIR WITH

02:10:37.196 --> 02:10:38.697
AN INDEPENDENT COMMISSION. BUT

02:10:38.764 --> 02:10:40.499
ABBOTT'S PLANS HAVE, QUOTE, MADE

02:10:40.566 --> 02:10:42.801
ME QUESTION THAT ENTIRE PROGRAM.

02:10:42.868 --> 02:10:44.570
THIS IS THE GOVERNOR OF THIS

02:10:44.636 --> 02:10:47.839
STATE OPENLY ADVOCATING FOR

02:10:47.906 --> 02:10:49.241
VIOLATING WHAT THE PEOPLE OF

02:10:49.308 --> 02:10:50.542
CALIFORNIA PUT IN THE

02:10:50.609 --> 02:10:52.511
CONSTITUTION FOR AN INDEPENDENT

02:10:52.578 --> 02:10:54.246
REDISTRICTING COMMISSION. SO IT

02:10:54.313 --> 02:10:56.481
IS TOUGH FOR ME, AND WITH ALL

02:10:56.548 --> 02:10:57.849
DUE RESPECT TO MY GOOD FRIEND

02:10:57.916 --> 02:11:00.018
AND COLLEAGUE FROM DOWNEY TO

02:11:00.085 --> 02:11:02.521
LECTURE ON HOW THE TRUMP

02:11:02.588 --> 02:11:06.425
ADMINISTRATION IS VIOLATING

02:11:06.491 --> 02:11:08.227
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS BECAUSE

02:11:08.293 --> 02:11:10.462
NOBODY REPLICATES PRESIDENT

02:11:10.529 --> 02:11:13.232
TRUMP MORE THAN CALIFORNIA'S

02:11:13.298 --> 02:11:15.867
GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM. THANK

02:11:15.934 --> 02:11:17.369
YOU, ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON.

02:11:17.436 --> 02:11:18.837
LEADER GALLAGHER, YOU ARE

02:11:18.904 --> 02:11:20.839
RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MR.

02:11:20.906 --> 02:11:22.641
SPEAKER. MEMBERS, I RISE ON LAW

02:11:22.708 --> 02:11:27.012
DAY AS THE ONLY PERSON IN THIS

02:11:27.079 --> 02:11:28.447
BODY WHO'S EVER ACTUALLY TAKEN

02:11:28.513 --> 02:11:31.817
ON A KING IN COURT, AND ONE WHEN

02:11:31.883 --> 02:11:35.287
I TOOK ON KING GAVIN NEWSOM IN

02:11:35.354 --> 02:11:37.923
2020 AND WENT TO COURT OVER HIS

02:11:37.990 --> 02:11:39.992
VIOLATION, CLEAR VIOLATION OF

02:11:40.058 --> 02:11:41.460
SEPARATION OF POWERS, WHICH WAS

02:11:41.526 --> 02:11:42.861
MENTIONED EARLIER, I THINK IS

02:11:42.928 --> 02:11:45.831
VERY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU HAVE AN

02:11:45.897 --> 02:11:47.266
EXECUTIVE WHO'S ASSERTING

02:11:47.332 --> 02:11:49.301
LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY. AND MY

02:11:49.368 --> 02:11:51.069
COLLEAGUES, YOU KNOW, FROM FROM

02:11:51.136 --> 02:11:53.739
ROCKLAND AND SAN DIEGO, ACTUALLY

02:11:53.805 --> 02:11:55.841
GAVE SEVERAL VERY GOOD EXAMPLES

02:11:55.907 --> 02:11:57.809
OF HOW HE HAS DONE THIS

02:11:57.876 --> 02:11:59.444
CONTINUOUSLY WHILE THIS BODY HAS

02:11:59.511 --> 02:12:02.214
REMAINED SILENT AND DONE

02:12:02.281 --> 02:12:04.416
RELATIVELY NOTHING TO COUNTER

02:12:04.483 --> 02:12:06.852
HIM. AND I'VE SAID THIS ON THIS

02:12:06.918 --> 02:12:10.622
FLOOR MANY TIMES, THAT MY

02:12:10.689 --> 02:12:11.290
DISAPPOINTMENT THAT WE DON'T

02:12:11.356 --> 02:12:12.924
PUSH BACK ON THOSE THINGS. BUT

02:12:12.991 --> 02:12:14.993
I'LL ADD ONE MORE TO THAT, A

02:12:15.060 --> 02:12:16.695
VIOLATION, ACTUALLY, OF DIRECT

02:12:16.762 --> 02:12:18.130
DEMOCRACY THAT WE'RE OFTEN

02:12:18.196 --> 02:12:20.632
LECTURED ON IN THIS BODY ABOUT

02:12:20.699 --> 02:12:23.201
THE DEATH PENALTY THAT HE

02:12:23.268 --> 02:12:25.370
SUMMARILY ENDED AND SAID, WE ARE

02:12:25.437 --> 02:12:26.605
NO LONGER GOING TO DO, DESPITE

02:12:26.672 --> 02:12:29.308
THE VOTERS OF THIS STATE TWICE

02:12:29.374 --> 02:12:32.077
VOTING TO UPHOLD THE DEATH

02:12:32.144 --> 02:12:32.978
PENALTY. SO, YEAH, YOU KNOW,

02:12:33.045 --> 02:12:36.481
LOOK, OFTENTIMES WE TALK ABOUT

02:12:36.548 --> 02:12:38.016
VIOLATIONS OF EXECUTIVE POWER,

02:12:38.083 --> 02:12:39.885
AND WE DO IT ABOUT THE OTHER

02:12:39.951 --> 02:12:41.620
PARTY, RIGHT? WE TEND TO BE MORE

02:12:41.687 --> 02:12:43.455
CRITICAL OF THE OTHER PARTY AND

02:12:43.522 --> 02:12:45.857
NOT LOOKING AT THE CLEAR

02:12:45.924 --> 02:12:47.225
VIOLATIONS, MAYBE WITHIN YOUR

02:12:47.292 --> 02:12:50.996
OWN PARTY WHERE THAT'S HAPPENED.

02:12:51.063 --> 02:12:53.098
AND, YOU KNOW, AGAIN, IF WE'RE

02:12:53.165 --> 02:12:54.866
GOING TO CALL THIS OUT AND TALK

02:12:54.933 --> 02:12:55.967
ABOUT THAT, THEN LET'S CALL

02:12:56.034 --> 02:12:58.437
ABOUT CALL OUT THOSE THINGS

02:12:58.503 --> 02:13:01.707
FAIRLY. ANOTHER MORE RECENT ONE,

02:13:01.773 --> 02:13:03.008
EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT ESTABLISHED

02:13:03.075 --> 02:13:05.177
THE POLICY OF THE STATE THAT WE

02:13:05.243 --> 02:13:06.712
WERE GOING TO BAN GAS POWERED

02:13:06.778 --> 02:13:09.648
VEHICLES. WAS THAT A LEGISLATIVE

02:13:09.715 --> 02:13:12.417
POLICY PASSED BY THIS BODY? NO.

02:13:12.484 --> 02:13:14.286
DO WE HAVE DEBATES OVER THAT IN

02:13:14.353 --> 02:13:16.054
OUR COMMITTEES? DO WE ALLOW FOR

02:13:16.121 --> 02:13:19.057
DIRECT DEMOCRACY INPUT? NO.

02:13:19.124 --> 02:13:21.626
GAVIN NEWSOM JUST DID IT. AND

02:13:21.693 --> 02:13:23.829
THEN WHEN HE GOT SLAPPED DOWN BY

02:13:23.895 --> 02:13:24.796
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT,

02:13:24.863 --> 02:13:26.932
RIGHTFULLY SO, AND SAID, NO, YOU

02:13:26.998 --> 02:13:29.134
CAN'T DO THIS RIGHT. HE'S NOW

02:13:29.201 --> 02:13:30.869
COME BACK AND ISSUED ANOTHER

02:13:30.936 --> 02:13:32.003
EXECUTIVE ORDER. BUT I HAVEN'T

02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:34.806
HEARD ANYBODY TALK ABOUT THAT.

02:13:34.873 --> 02:13:37.642
RIGHT. BECAUSE YOU LIKE THE

02:13:37.709 --> 02:13:39.444
POLICY, BECAUSE YOU THINK THAT'S

02:13:39.511 --> 02:13:40.979
WHAT WE SHOULD DO, EVEN THOUGH

02:13:41.046 --> 02:13:42.647
THERE'S A CLEAR VIOLATION OF

02:13:42.714 --> 02:13:45.217
SEPARATION OF POWERS. SO AGAIN,

02:13:45.283 --> 02:13:47.519
LET'S BE CONSISTENT. LET'S STAND

02:13:47.586 --> 02:13:50.222
UP FOR RULE OF LAW. LET'S STAND

02:13:50.288 --> 02:13:51.857
UP FOR SEPARATION OF POWERS WHEN

02:13:51.923 --> 02:13:55.293
IT MATTERS, LIKE WHEN YOU ARE

02:13:55.360 --> 02:13:55.894
ACTUALLY BEING USURPED OF YOUR

02:13:55.961 --> 02:13:58.964
POWERS AND YOUR RIGHTS. AND JUST

02:13:59.030 --> 02:14:01.099
A FEW YEARS AGO THAT HAPPENED

02:14:01.166 --> 02:14:03.402
MANY TIMES AND IT'S CONTINUED TO

02:14:03.468 --> 02:14:05.303
HAPPEN. SO SPEAK UP WHEN THAT'S

02:14:05.370 --> 02:14:07.105
HAPPENING. ALSO, THANK YOU.

02:14:07.172 --> 02:14:10.075
THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:14:10.142 --> 02:14:10.609
GALLAGHER, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:14:10.675 --> 02:14:13.245
KALRA, YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. IT'S

02:14:13.311 --> 02:14:15.147
INTERESTING HOW THE CONVERSATION

02:14:15.213 --> 02:14:17.282
FROM OUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES

02:14:17.349 --> 02:14:18.784
HAVE VEERED AWAY FROM ACTUALLY

02:14:18.850 --> 02:14:19.684
TALKING ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW

02:14:19.751 --> 02:14:22.621
AND LAW DAY AND TALK ABOUT THEIR

02:14:22.687 --> 02:14:24.456
OBSESSION WITH ATTACKING

02:14:24.523 --> 02:14:26.591
GOVERNOR NEWSOM, WHEN THE

02:14:26.658 --> 02:14:28.860
REALITY IS THAT, AS WAS JUST

02:14:28.927 --> 02:14:30.262
MENTIONED, THERE ARE EXECUTIVE

02:14:30.328 --> 02:14:31.430
ORDERS THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS

02:14:31.496 --> 02:14:32.931
DONE, SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN

02:14:32.998 --> 02:14:34.833
SHOT DOWN BY THE COURTS. THAT'S

02:14:34.900 --> 02:14:36.735
THE WHOLE POINT OF LAW DAY. IN

02:14:36.802 --> 02:14:38.470
FACT, OUR MAJORITY LEADER JUST

02:14:38.537 --> 02:14:41.406
SAID HE WON IN COURT AGAINST OUR

02:14:41.473 --> 02:14:44.643
GOVERNOR. THAT IS A CELEBRATION

02:14:44.709 --> 02:14:49.014
OF LAW DAY. THAT IS THE

02:14:49.080 --> 02:14:54.986
CELEBRATION OF LAW DAY. IS

02:14:55.053 --> 02:14:57.956
RESPECTING THE RULE OF LAW. IN

02:14:58.023 --> 02:15:00.025
FACT, IF YOU ACTUALLY READ THE

02:15:00.091 --> 02:15:00.926
RESOLUTION, YOU WILL SEE MUCH OF

02:15:00.992 --> 02:15:05.730
THE FOCUS ON IT HAS TO DO WITH

02:15:05.797 --> 02:15:08.700
PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNING

02:15:08.767 --> 02:15:10.235
EXECUTIVE ORDERS, GOING AFTER

02:15:10.302 --> 02:15:12.137
LAW FIRMS THAT HAVE THE GALL TO

02:15:12.204 --> 02:15:14.873
REPRESENT ANYONE THAT CHALLENGES

02:15:14.940 --> 02:15:18.109
PRESIDENT TRUMP. THAT IS AN

02:15:18.176 --> 02:15:20.145
ATTACK ON OUR LEGAL SYSTEM, AN

02:15:20.212 --> 02:15:22.013
ATTACK ON OUR LAWYERS. IT'S

02:15:22.080 --> 02:15:24.516
INTENDED TO HAVE LAWYERS IN

02:15:24.583 --> 02:15:28.220
FEAR, SIMILAR TO THAT

02:15:28.286 --> 02:15:29.921
SHAKESPEARE IN THE LION. THE

02:15:29.988 --> 02:15:31.456
FIRST THING WE DO, LET'S KILL

02:15:31.523 --> 02:15:34.292
ALL THE LAWYERS BECAUSE IT'S THE

02:15:34.359 --> 02:15:37.529
LAWYERS THAT KEEP TYRANNY IN

02:15:37.596 --> 02:15:39.631
CHECK. IT'S THE LAWYERS THAT

02:15:39.698 --> 02:15:42.167

OURSELVES AND OUR GOVERNOR AND

OUR PRESIDENT, IN CHECK. THAT'S

02:15:45.303 --> 02:15:46.938
WHAT LAW IS ABOUT. WE HAVE A

02:15:47.005 --> 02:15:49.774
PRESIDENT THAT REFUSED TO

02:15:49.841 --> 02:15:52.577
ACKNOWLEDGE LAW DAY THIS YEAR,

02:15:52.644 --> 02:15:54.079
SO WE'RE GOING TO DO IT

02:15:54.145 --> 02:15:54.713
OURSELVES AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

02:15:54.779 --> 02:15:57.315
THE RULE OF LAW, THE RULE OF

02:15:57.382 --> 02:16:00.285

02:16:00.352 --> 02:16:02.721
OF US, NO MATTER WHAT OUR TITLE

02:16:02.787 --> 02:16:04.623

CONSTITUTION, AND IT'S THE RULE

02:16:07.559 --> 02:16:10.262
OF LAW THAT KEEPS US IN CHECK,

02:16:10.328 --> 02:16:13.532
NOT OBEYING SOME POLITICAL CULT

02:16:13.598 --> 02:16:17.102
OF MAGA. THANK YOU, ASSEMBLY

02:18:13.785 --> 02:18:15.286
CONGRESS RECENTLY PASSED A BILL

02:18:15.353 --> 02:18:17.722
THAT FEATURES DEVASTATING CUTS

02:18:17.789 --> 02:18:19.791
TO LOW INCOME AND MIDDLE CLASS

02:18:19.858 --> 02:18:22.027
AMERICANS. SNAP FUNDING HAS BEEN

02:18:22.093 --> 02:18:24.829
DECREASED BY 20%, REPRESENTING

02:18:24.896 --> 02:18:27.866
THE LARGEST CUT IN SNAP HISTORY.

02:18:27.932 --> 02:18:29.567
OVER 22 MILLION FAMILIES ACROSS

02:18:29.634 --> 02:18:31.369
THE COUNTRY ARE EXPECTED TO LOSE

02:18:31.436 --> 02:18:33.505
SOME OR ALL OF THEIR STAFF

02:18:33.571 --> 02:18:35.707
BENEFITS. BECAUSE OF THIS. THESE

02:18:35.774 --> 02:18:37.442
CUTS WILL BE EXPERIENCED

02:18:37.509 --> 02:18:39.644
THROUGHOUT OUR STATE AS AN

02:18:39.711 --> 02:18:41.713
ESTIMATED 1 IN 5 CALIFORNIANS

02:18:41.780 --> 02:18:45.417
FACE FOOD INSECURITY. CALFRESH,

02:18:45.483 --> 02:18:47.252
WHICH IS FUNDED THROUGH SNAP,

02:18:47.318 --> 02:18:48.620
HELPS MEET THIS NEED BY

02:18:48.687 --> 02:18:51.690
PROVIDING FOOD ASSISTANCE TO 5.5

02:18:51.756 --> 02:18:55.060
MILLION CALIFORNIANS FOR OLDER

02:18:55.126 --> 02:18:57.295
ADULTS, SINGLE PARENTS AND RURAL

02:18:57.362 --> 02:18:58.730
COMMUNITIES WHO RELY ON

02:18:58.797 --> 02:19:01.933
CALFRESH. IT IS A LIFELINE. SNAP

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:05.336
SUPPORTS 173,000 CALIFORNIA JOBS

02:19:05.403 --> 02:19:08.373
IN FOOD AND AG. UNFORTUNATELY,

02:19:08.440 --> 02:19:09.574
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS

02:19:09.641 --> 02:19:11.710
DECIDED TO TAKE MONEY OUT OF OUR

02:19:11.776 --> 02:19:14.512
COMMUNITIES AND FOOD OFF OF OUR

02:19:14.579 --> 02:19:16.581
TABLES. FOOD IS NOT A LUXURY,

02:19:16.648 --> 02:19:19.284
IT'S A NECESSITY. COR SENDS AN

02:19:19.350 --> 02:19:21.086
IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO CONGRESS

02:19:21.152 --> 02:19:22.821
AND OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT WE

02:19:22.887 --> 02:19:24.622
RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF SNAP

02:19:24.689 --> 02:19:27.192
AND CALFRESH BENEFITS IN

02:19:27.258 --> 02:19:28.927
ALLEVIATING HUNGER. THANK YOU.

02:19:28.993 --> 02:19:30.295
AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN

02:19:30.361 --> 02:19:33.732
AYE VOTE. THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:19:33.798 --> 02:19:35.433
CALDERON, ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE OR

02:19:35.500 --> 02:19:39.771
RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MR.

02:19:39.838 --> 02:19:41.539
SPEAKER, AS OUR ASSEMBLY HUMAN

02:19:41.606 --> 02:19:43.541
SERVICES COMMITTEE CHAIR, I RISE

02:19:43.608 --> 02:19:46.277
IN STRONG SUPPORT FOR SER THREE,

02:19:46.344 --> 02:19:49.180
WHICH CALLS ON CONGRESS TO ROLL

02:19:49.247 --> 02:19:52.050
BACK THEIR DRASTIC CUTS TO SNAP

02:19:52.117 --> 02:19:53.818
IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT, FOLLOWING

02:19:53.885 --> 02:19:56.421
UP TO THE JULY 4TH WEEKEND, THE

02:19:56.488 --> 02:19:57.422
CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS IN THE

02:19:57.489 --> 02:19:59.190
SENATE AND THE HOUSE RUSHED

02:19:59.257 --> 02:20:00.325
THROUGH A BILL THAT THEY KNEW

02:20:00.391 --> 02:20:02.093
WAS SO UNPOPULAR THAT THEY HAD

02:20:02.160 --> 02:20:04.662
TO TRY TO DO IT IN THE DEAD OF

02:20:04.729 --> 02:20:06.197
NIGHT. AND IN IT, THAT BIG BILL,

02:20:06.264 --> 02:20:09.701
THE BIG BS BILL, IS THE LARGEST

02:20:09.768 --> 02:20:11.069
TRANSFERENCE OF WEALTH FROM THE

02:20:11.136 --> 02:20:12.971
POOR TO THE RICH IN THIS

02:20:13.037 --> 02:20:15.774
COUNTRY'S HISTORY. THEY PROMISED

02:20:15.840 --> 02:20:17.575
AND MAKE A BIG TALK ABOUT

02:20:17.642 --> 02:20:18.843
TEMPORARY TAX CUTS TO WORKING

02:20:18.910 --> 02:20:20.912
CLASS PEOPLE, OR SMALL TAX CUTS

02:20:20.979 --> 02:20:21.746
TO WORKING CLASS PEOPLE. THE

02:20:21.813 --> 02:20:23.314
REALITY IS THAT MILLIONAIRES AND

02:20:23.381 --> 02:20:25.517
BILLIONAIRES WALK AWAY WITH

02:20:25.583 --> 02:20:26.951
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS, IF NOT

02:20:27.018 --> 02:20:28.052
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF TAX

02:20:28.119 --> 02:20:30.121
BREAKS, ALL TO DO WHAT, SO THEY

02:20:30.188 --> 02:20:32.357
COULD CUT HEALTH CARE SO THEY

02:20:32.423 --> 02:20:35.160
CUT FOOD ASSISTANCE. CALFRESH

02:20:35.226 --> 02:20:37.428
ARE SUCCESSFUL BIPARTISAN

02:20:37.495 --> 02:20:38.830
SUPPORTED PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA.

02:20:38.897 --> 02:20:40.932
THE MOST EFFECTIVE PROGRAM AT

02:20:40.999 --> 02:20:42.433
COMBATING FOOD INSECURITY IN

02:20:42.500 --> 02:20:43.835
CALIFORNIA, WHICH SUPPORTS

02:20:43.902 --> 02:20:46.437
NEARLY 1 IN 5 CALIFORNIANS, IS

02:20:46.504 --> 02:20:49.307
ALMOST SOLELY FUNDED BY SNAP.

02:20:49.374 --> 02:20:50.708
AND WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

02:20:50.775 --> 02:20:52.143
TAKES AWAY MONEY, MAKES IT

02:20:52.210 --> 02:20:54.412
HARDER FOR PEOPLE TO GET ON THE

02:20:54.479 --> 02:20:55.747
PROGRAM AND PUTS MORE OF THE

02:20:55.814 --> 02:20:57.248
COST ONTO THE STATE. THEY KNOW

02:20:57.315 --> 02:20:58.683
WILLINGLY THAT THERE ARE LESS

02:20:58.750 --> 02:21:00.051
CALIFORNIANS, IN FACT, LESS

02:21:00.118 --> 02:21:01.586
AMERICANS, AND MANY EVEN RED

02:21:01.653 --> 02:21:04.022
STATES THAT WILL LOSE FOOD

02:21:04.088 --> 02:21:06.658
ASSISTANCE. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT

02:21:06.724 --> 02:21:12.397
THE CUT OVER TEN YEARS WILL BE

02:21:12.463 --> 02:21:15.466
$287 BILLION TO FOOD ASSISTANCE.

02:21:15.533 --> 02:21:19.170
THOSE COSTS WILL BE ONLY

02:21:19.237 --> 02:21:20.572
RECUPERATED FOR BILLIONAIRES.

02:21:20.638 --> 02:21:22.740
BUT THE REAL LIVES AND THE REAL

02:21:22.807 --> 02:21:24.642
CHILDREN THAT GO HUNGRY IS

02:21:24.709 --> 02:21:25.510
INCALCULABLE. WHILE CALIFORNIA

02:21:25.577 --> 02:21:27.812
IS THE FOOD BASKET OF THE WORLD,

02:21:27.879 --> 02:21:29.914
WE ACROSS BOTH PARTIES HAVE

02:21:29.981 --> 02:21:31.449
WORKED VERY HARD TO TALK ABOUT

02:21:31.516 --> 02:21:33.284
HOW DO WE BOOST THE NUMBER?

02:21:33.351 --> 02:21:34.986
BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE IN

02:21:35.053 --> 02:21:35.620
CALIFORNIA THAT ELIGIBLE THAN

02:21:35.687 --> 02:21:36.888
ACTUALLY USE THE SERVICE, AND WE

02:21:36.955 --> 02:21:38.723
HAVE WORKED VERY HARD, HAND IN

02:21:38.790 --> 02:21:40.191
HAND, TO MAKE SURE THAT MORE

02:21:40.258 --> 02:21:41.559
CALIFORNIANS ARE GETTING THE

02:21:41.626 --> 02:21:42.093
FOOD ASSISTANCE THAT THEY

02:21:42.160 --> 02:21:43.761
DESERVE AND THEY NEED. BUT YET

02:21:43.828 --> 02:21:44.863
THESE EFFORTS TOTALLY FLY IN THE

02:21:44.929 --> 02:21:46.731
FACE OF THAT. SO I HOPE THAT WE

02:21:46.798 --> 02:21:48.366
WILL BE BIPARTISAN IN OUR

02:21:48.433 --> 02:21:49.934
SUPPORT TO ASK CONGRESS TO ROLL

02:21:50.001 --> 02:21:51.502
BACK THESE DRACONIAN CUTS AND

02:21:51.569 --> 02:21:53.037
RESTORE THE FOOD BENEFITS THAT

02:21:53.104 --> 02:21:55.206
SO MANY FAMILIES RELY ON. I

02:21:55.273 --> 02:21:57.275
ASKED FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU,

02:21:57.342 --> 02:21:59.344
ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE, ASSEMBLY

02:21:59.410 --> 02:22:00.211
MEMBER DE MAYO, YOU ARE

02:22:00.278 --> 02:22:03.448
RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MR.

02:22:03.514 --> 02:22:06.651
SPEAKER. I RISE TO BRING SOME

02:22:06.718 --> 02:22:09.587
TRUTH AND ACCURACY TO THIS

02:22:09.654 --> 02:22:12.190
CONVERSATION. MY COLLEAGUE FROM

02:22:12.257 --> 02:22:14.626
THE BAY AREA SAYS THAT HE WANTS

02:22:14.692 --> 02:22:16.761
A BIPARTISAN COMMITMENT. I TOO,

02:22:16.828 --> 02:22:18.496
WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A BIPARTISAN

02:22:18.563 --> 02:22:20.765
COMMITMENT. TO WHAT

02:22:20.832 --> 02:22:22.433
CALIFORNIANS, IN A FUNDAMENTALLY

02:22:22.500 --> 02:22:25.270
FAIR VEIN, WOULD LIKE TO OFFER

02:22:25.336 --> 02:22:29.340
PEOPLE DOWN ON THEIR LUCK. ALL

02:22:29.407 --> 02:22:30.742
CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT GIVING

02:22:30.808 --> 02:22:32.610
PEOPLE HELP WHEN THEY'RE DOWN ON

02:22:32.677 --> 02:22:34.345
THEIR LUCK. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A

02:22:34.412 --> 02:22:36.481
SOCIAL SAFETY NET, AND YOU

02:22:36.547 --> 02:22:39.384
SHOULD SUPPORT THE REFORMS IN

02:22:39.450 --> 02:22:41.586
THE FEDERAL BILL, BECAUSE IT'S

02:22:41.653 --> 02:22:43.788
ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A

02:22:43.855 --> 02:22:45.290
STRONG SOCIAL SAFETY NET FOR

02:22:45.356 --> 02:22:47.892
THOSE THAT NEED THESE BENEFITS

02:22:47.959 --> 02:22:52.030
AND THIS HELP THE MOST. EITHER

02:22:52.096 --> 02:22:53.698
YOU DIDN'T READ THE BILL OR

02:22:53.765 --> 02:22:56.134
YOU'RE OPENLY AND WANTONLY

02:22:56.200 --> 02:22:57.735
MISREPRESENTING IT. AND SO I

02:22:57.802 --> 02:23:00.505
FEEL COMPELLED TO SET THE RECORD

02:23:00.571 --> 02:23:01.572
STRAIGHT. SO AT LEAST

02:23:01.639 --> 02:23:05.276
CALIFORNIANS KNOW WHAT REFORMS

02:23:05.343 --> 02:23:07.378
YOU ARE OPPOSING OR

02:23:07.445 --> 02:23:08.479
MISCHARACTERIZING. IN THIS

02:23:08.546 --> 02:23:09.747
RESOLUTION. YOU SAY THAT THERE

02:23:09.814 --> 02:23:12.350
ARE, QUOTE, DRASTIC CUTS TO SNAP

02:23:12.417 --> 02:23:14.319
QUOTE, MILLIONS WILL BE THROWN

02:23:14.385 --> 02:23:16.721
OFF OF FOOD STAMPS. THERE ARE

02:23:16.788 --> 02:23:19.991
ONLY TWO REFORMS IN THE BIG

02:23:20.058 --> 02:23:22.093
BEAUTIFUL BILL AS IT RELATES TO

02:23:22.160 --> 02:23:23.594
FOOD STAMPS OR SNAP. LET ME TELL

02:23:23.661 --> 02:23:24.929
YOU WHAT THOSE TWO REFORMS ARE.

02:23:24.996 --> 02:23:26.331
AND THEY ARE SUPPORTED

02:23:26.397 --> 02:23:27.465
OVERWHELMINGLY BY YOUR

02:23:27.532 --> 02:23:29.267
CONSTITUENTS. REFORM. NUMBER

02:23:29.334 --> 02:23:33.705
ONE, WE NEED TO CRACK DOWN ON

02:23:33.771 --> 02:23:36.240
FRAUD. THERE IS A HIGH FRAUD

02:23:36.307 --> 02:23:37.742
RATE IN THE FOOD STAMPS PROGRAM.

02:23:37.809 --> 02:23:40.078
IT IS DOCUMENTED EVEN OUR OWN

02:23:40.144 --> 02:23:41.479
GOVERNOR PUTS OUT AN ANNUAL

02:23:41.546 --> 02:23:43.982
REPORT VERIFYING THE ANNUAL

02:23:44.048 --> 02:23:45.750
FRAUD RATE. THE INSPECTOR

02:23:45.817 --> 02:23:46.985
GENERAL OF HEALTH AND HUMAN

02:23:47.051 --> 02:23:48.820
SERVICES AND THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:23:48.886 --> 02:23:51.289
AGRICULTURE HAVE FRAUD AUDITS OF

02:23:51.356 --> 02:23:53.424
STATE ADMINISTERED PROGRAMS LIKE

02:23:53.491 --> 02:23:56.461
SNAP. CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE

02:23:56.527 --> 02:23:57.595
WORST OFFENDERS FOR WELFARE

02:23:57.662 --> 02:23:59.664
FRAUD. THE SNAP PROGRAM IN

02:23:59.731 --> 02:24:02.166
CALIFORNIA HAS A 13.6% FRAUD

02:24:02.233 --> 02:24:04.736
RATE. EVERY DOLLAR THAT GOES OUT

02:24:04.802 --> 02:24:06.838
IS A DOLLAR THAT TAXPAYERS

02:24:06.904 --> 02:24:08.639
WANTED TO GIVE SOMEONE TRULY IN

02:24:08.706 --> 02:24:10.375
NEED. BUT THAT DOLLAR IS NO

02:24:10.441 --> 02:24:12.143
LONGER THERE TO HELP NEEDY

02:24:12.210 --> 02:24:14.512
PEOPLE. WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO

02:24:14.579 --> 02:24:17.682
FIX THE FRAUD PROBLEM, BUT THERE

02:24:17.749 --> 02:24:19.784
IS NO SKIN IN THE GAME FOR THE

02:24:19.851 --> 02:24:20.485
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE JUST

02:24:20.551 --> 02:24:22.020
ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM. WE CASH

02:24:22.086 --> 02:24:23.421
THE CHECKS FROM THE FEDERAL

02:24:23.488 --> 02:24:24.389
GOVERNMENT. AND SO WHAT THE

02:24:24.455 --> 02:24:25.957
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOW SAYING

02:24:26.024 --> 02:24:27.291
IS, SINCE THE STATES ADMINISTER

02:24:27.358 --> 02:24:29.427
IT, THEY'VE GOT TO DO A BETTER

02:24:29.494 --> 02:24:31.396
JOB. THEY HAVE TO BE HELD

02:24:31.462 --> 02:24:32.063
ACCOUNTABLE. SO CALIFORNIA WILL

02:24:32.130 --> 02:24:35.366
HAVE NO CUT FOR ITS FRAUD RATE.

02:24:35.433 --> 02:24:36.868
AS LONG AS WE REDUCE OUR FRAUD

02:24:36.934 --> 02:24:39.337
RATE FROM 13.6% DOWN TO 5%. IF

02:24:39.404 --> 02:24:42.607
YOU WANT TO AVOID A SNAP CUT FOR

02:24:42.673 --> 02:24:44.409
CALIFORNIA, PASS A LAW AND HOLD

02:24:44.475 --> 02:24:47.211
THIS GOVERNOR ACCOUNTABLE FOR

02:24:47.278 --> 02:24:48.579
ADMINISTERING THESE WELFARE

02:24:48.646 --> 02:24:51.449
BENEFITS APPROPRIATELY. STOP THE

02:24:51.516 --> 02:24:53.084
FRAUDSTERS FROM BILKING

02:24:53.151 --> 02:24:54.352
TAXPAYERS. THAT'S WHAT YOUR

02:24:54.419 --> 02:24:55.453
CONSTITUENTS WANT. SO THE

02:24:55.520 --> 02:24:56.954
DOLLARS ARE THERE TO HELP THE

02:24:57.021 --> 02:24:58.856
NEEDIEST AMONG US. AND HERE'S

02:24:58.923 --> 02:25:00.091
THE OTHER THING THAT'S REQUIRED

02:25:00.158 --> 02:25:02.560
UNDER THE FEDERAL BILL A WORK

02:25:02.627 --> 02:25:05.730
REQUIREMENT, A 20 HOUR WORK

02:25:05.797 --> 02:25:07.331
REQUIREMENT IS EXPANDED UNDER

02:25:07.398 --> 02:25:09.901
THE SNAP BILL. THE SNAP PROGRAM.

02:25:09.967 --> 02:25:12.470
NOW, WHAT WORK REQUIRES IS,

02:25:12.537 --> 02:25:13.571
NUMBER ONE, EITHER TRY TO GET A

02:25:13.638 --> 02:25:18.509
JOB OR TO GO TO SCHOOL, OR

02:25:18.576 --> 02:25:20.378
THREE. I KNOW THAT THIS IS GOING

02:25:20.445 --> 02:25:21.679
TO BE A JUST AN EARTH CHANGER

02:25:21.746 --> 02:25:24.816
FOR A LOT OF FOLKS. MINDBENDER.

02:25:24.882 --> 02:25:26.651
VOLUNTEER FOR A NONPROFIT

02:25:26.717 --> 02:25:29.921
COMMUNITY SERVICE ORGANIZATION.

02:25:29.987 --> 02:25:32.523
AGAIN, A SUPER MAJORITY OF

02:25:32.590 --> 02:25:33.558
CALIFORNIA VOTERS, INCLUDING

02:25:33.624 --> 02:25:35.793
YOUR CONSTITUENTS. THEY'RE OKAY

02:25:35.860 --> 02:25:37.495
GIVING HELP TO PEOPLE, BUT IF

02:25:37.562 --> 02:25:39.063
YOU'RE ABLE BODIED, AT LEAST DO

02:25:39.130 --> 02:25:41.732
SOMETHING TO GIVE BACK. AND LET

02:25:41.799 --> 02:25:44.202
ME TELL YOU IN CONCLUSION WHY

02:25:44.268 --> 02:25:45.069
THIS IS SO IMPORTANT. I'VE HAD

02:25:45.136 --> 02:25:47.939
SOME FRIENDS OVER THE YEARS

02:25:48.005 --> 02:25:51.142
WHO'VE DEALT WITH DEPRESSION.

02:25:51.209 --> 02:25:53.411
HAVING LOST MY MOTHER, I'VE HAD

02:25:53.478 --> 02:25:55.513
TO DEAL WITH DEPRESSION, AND I

02:25:55.580 --> 02:25:57.715
REMEMBER THE DARK DAYS AND

02:25:57.782 --> 02:25:58.683
SOMETIMES, AND I TELL MY FRIENDS

02:25:58.750 --> 02:26:00.184
WHEN THEY ARE DEALING WITH

02:26:00.251 --> 02:26:01.752
DEPRESSION, EVERY DAY YOU GET

02:26:01.819 --> 02:26:04.222
OUT OF BED, EVERY DAY YOU

02:26:04.288 --> 02:26:06.757
SHOWER, EVERY DAY YOU PUT ON

02:26:06.824 --> 02:26:08.126
CLOTHES AND YOU WALK OUT THAT

02:26:08.192 --> 02:26:12.063
DOOR. YOU'VE JUST WON. 30S PUT

02:26:12.130 --> 02:26:13.798
ONE FOOT IN FRONT OF THE OTHER.

02:26:13.865 --> 02:26:14.599
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH

02:26:14.665 --> 02:26:16.033
WELFARE RECIPIENTS IS WE'RE

02:26:16.100 --> 02:26:17.668
TRYING TO TELL THEM, LOOK, WE'RE

02:26:17.735 --> 02:26:19.604
NOT EXPECTING YOU TO GET A 40

02:26:19.670 --> 02:26:20.638
HOUR JOB, BUT DO SOMETHING. AND

02:26:20.705 --> 02:26:22.140
THERE IS A NONPROFIT CHARITY

02:26:22.206 --> 02:26:24.208
THAT IF YOU CAN'T GET A PAID

02:26:24.275 --> 02:26:26.844
JOB, GO HELP THAT CHARITY MAKE A

02:26:26.911 --> 02:26:30.148
BETTER, STRONGER COMMUNITY BY

02:26:30.214 --> 02:26:30.715
MISCHARACTERIZING THIS BILL.

02:26:30.781 --> 02:26:33.351
EITHER YOU DID NOT READ IT OR

02:26:33.417 --> 02:26:35.153
YOU'RE SPREADING MISINFORMATION.

02:26:35.219 --> 02:26:37.054
LET'S FOCUS ON THE JOB WE CAN

02:26:37.121 --> 02:26:39.023
DO. LET'S GET THESE PEOPLE BACK

02:26:39.090 --> 02:26:40.491
TO WORK AND LET'S REDUCE THE

02:26:40.558 --> 02:26:42.026
FRAUDULENT BENEFITS. I URGE YOU

02:26:42.093 --> 02:26:43.761

02:26:55.640 --> 02:26:58.075
RESOLUTION THREE. THIS

02:26:58.142 --> 02:26:59.677
RESOLUTION URGES CONGRESS TO

02:26:59.744 --> 02:27:00.678
PROTECT THE SUPPLEMENTAL

02:27:00.745 --> 02:27:02.847
NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.

02:27:02.914 --> 02:27:04.048
COLLEAGUES, IT GOES WITHOUT

02:27:04.115 --> 02:27:06.484
SAYING FOOD SECURITY IS NOT A

02:27:06.551 --> 02:27:09.253
LUXURY. IT'S A NECESSITY IN SAN

02:27:09.320 --> 02:27:10.855
DIEGO COUNTY ALONE. SO SPEAKING

02:27:10.922 --> 02:27:14.358
ABOUT OUR CONSTITUENTS, OVER

02:27:14.425 --> 02:27:16.160
330,000 RESIDENTS RELY ON

02:27:16.227 --> 02:27:17.929
CALFRESH BENEFITS, INCLUDING

02:27:17.995 --> 02:27:20.865
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN,

02:27:20.932 --> 02:27:23.834
SENIORS, VETERANS AND COLLEGE

02:27:23.901 --> 02:27:25.102
STUDENTS. PEOPLE WHO ARE IN

02:27:25.169 --> 02:27:27.338
SCHOOL WHO NEED CHILD CARE,

02:27:27.405 --> 02:27:29.373
PEOPLE WHO CAN'T WORK BECAUSE

02:27:29.440 --> 02:27:31.976
THEY HAVE A PHYSICAL DISABILITY.

02:27:32.043 --> 02:27:33.744
LOCAL FOOD BANKS ARE ALREADY

02:27:33.811 --> 02:27:35.580
STRAINED, AND CUTS TO SNAPS

02:27:35.646 --> 02:27:37.448
WOULD ONLY DEEPEN THE CRISIS IN

02:27:37.515 --> 02:27:40.017
OUR COMMUNITIES. WE'RE A STATE

02:27:40.084 --> 02:27:41.786
THAT GROWS SO MUCH OF THE

02:27:41.852 --> 02:27:42.887
NATION'S FOOD, YET MILLIONS OF

02:27:42.954 --> 02:27:45.890
OUR RESIDENTS, INCLUDING NEARLY

02:27:45.957 --> 02:27:48.993
1 IN 4 SAN DIEGANS, FACE FOOD

02:27:49.060 --> 02:27:50.795
INSECURITY. THIS IS NOT JUST A

02:27:50.861 --> 02:27:52.630
MORAL ISSUE, IT'S AN ECONOMIC

02:27:52.697 --> 02:27:54.699
ONE. EVERY DOLLAR IN SNAP

02:27:54.765 --> 02:27:59.003
GENERATES UP TO $1.8 IN LOCAL

02:27:59.070 --> 02:28:00.871
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. THAT MEANS

02:28:00.938 --> 02:28:02.640
THAT THESE CUTS WOULD HURT NOT

02:28:02.707 --> 02:28:04.475
JUST FAMILIES, BUT ALSO OUR

02:28:04.542 --> 02:28:07.178
SMALL BUSINESSES, LOCAL GROCERS,

02:28:07.245 --> 02:28:09.480
AND OUR BROADER COMMUNITY.

02:28:09.547 --> 02:28:10.948
PROTECTING SNAP IS ABOUT

02:28:11.015 --> 02:28:12.350
PROTECTING HEALTH, COMMUNITY

02:28:12.416 --> 02:28:14.151
STABILITY AND DIGNITY. IT'S

02:28:14.218 --> 02:28:16.621
ABOUT ENSURING THAT NO ONE IN

02:28:16.687 --> 02:28:18.756
ANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES HAS TO

02:28:18.823 --> 02:28:21.692
CHOOSE BETWEEN PAYING RENT AND

02:28:21.759 --> 02:28:24.729
FEEDING THEIR FAMILY. I

02:28:24.795 --> 02:28:25.563
RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE

02:28:25.630 --> 02:28:28.566
VOTE. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

02:28:28.633 --> 02:28:30.368
PATEL. ASSEMBLY MEMBER JEFF

02:28:32.970 --> 02:28:35.106
JUST WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE

BRINGS IT BACK, BACK CENTER,

02:28:40.478 --> 02:28:42.546
BACK TO HOME. RIGHT? HERE'S THE

02:28:42.613 --> 02:28:44.882
REALITY. PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY. YES,

02:28:44.949 --> 02:28:46.217
THERE'S WASTE, FRAUD AND ABUSE.

02:28:46.284 --> 02:28:47.685
WE UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT WE NEED

02:28:47.752 --> 02:28:49.987
TO COME TOGETHER AS A BODY TO

02:28:50.054 --> 02:28:51.555
MAKE SURE THAT WE PROTECT THE

02:28:51.622 --> 02:28:52.657
MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR

02:28:52.723 --> 02:28:53.524
COMMUNITIES. NOW, IF THAT MEANS

02:28:53.591 --> 02:28:55.059
THAT WE HAVE TO PUT SOME

02:28:55.126 --> 02:28:57.461
STRINGENT PROTECTIONS FOR, FOR

02:28:57.528 --> 02:28:59.063
FRAUD, GREAT. LET'S DO THAT. BUT

02:28:59.130 --> 02:29:00.665
ULTIMATELY, WHAT I THINK WE ALL

02:29:00.731 --> 02:29:02.700
WANT HERE IS THAT WE TAKE CARE

02:29:02.767 --> 02:29:03.801
OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE, THOSE

02:29:03.868 --> 02:29:05.636
PEOPLE WHO ARE HUNGRY IN EVERY

02:29:05.703 --> 02:29:07.738
SINGLE HOME ACROSS CALIFORNIA.

02:29:07.805 --> 02:29:08.906
AND THAT'S INCUMBENT UPON EVERY

02:29:08.973 --> 02:29:10.875
SINGLE ONE OF US AS LEADERS TO

02:29:10.941 --> 02:29:12.143
TAKE THAT STEP FORWARD AND SAY,

02:29:12.209 --> 02:29:14.512
HOW DO WE UNITE? HOW DO WE

02:29:14.578 --> 02:29:17.615
PROPOSE LEGISLATION THAT WILL

02:29:17.682 --> 02:29:20.051
HELP PEOPLE IN THE FUTURE?

02:29:20.117 --> 02:29:21.485
RIGHT, BECAUSE WE CAN'T DO

02:29:21.552 --> 02:29:23.688
ANYTHING RIGHT NOW EXCEPT TAKE

02:29:23.754 --> 02:29:26.123
THIS VOTE. BUT WHAT WE CAN DO IS

02:29:26.190 --> 02:29:27.625
THIS NEXT LEGISLATIVE YEAR, SAY,

02:29:27.692 --> 02:29:29.293
LET'S ALL COME TOGETHER. LET'S

02:29:29.360 --> 02:29:30.895
FIGURE OUT A SOLUTION, BECAUSE

02:29:30.961 --> 02:29:32.997
THERE'S FOLKS HERE IN OUR

02:29:33.064 --> 02:29:34.932
COMMUNITIES THAT ABSOLUTELY NEED

02:29:34.999 --> 02:29:36.734
OUR HELP AND NEED US TO BE

02:29:36.801 --> 02:29:38.669
LEADERS. BUT A UNITED

LEADERSHIP, A UNITED FRONT, WILL

02:29:40.404 --> 02:29:42.373
