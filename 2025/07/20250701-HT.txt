SOME HOUSEKEEPING ITEMS I WOULD

LIKE TO NOTE THAT FILE ITEM TWO,

THE FULL COMMITTEE, AND WE WILL

00:32:52.804 --> 00:32:57.008
BEGIN WITH ITEM ONE, SB 32 BY

00:32:57.075 --> 00:33:13.291
WEBER PEARSON.

00:33:16.894 --> 00:33:18.196
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY, SENATOR.

00:33:18.262 --> 00:33:21.933
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD

00:33:21.999 --> 00:33:23.234
AFTERNOON, MADAM CHAIR AND

00:33:23.301 --> 00:33:25.002
COMMITTEE MEMBERS, TODAY I WILL

00:33:25.069 --> 00:33:28.172
BE PRESENTING SB 32, WHICH

00:33:28.239 --> 00:33:30.541
REQUIRES CLEAR TIME AND DISTANCE

00:33:30.608 --> 00:33:32.410
STANDARDS TO BE ESTABLISHED FOR

00:33:32.477 --> 00:33:34.379
PERINATAL UNITS IN MEDI-CAL AND

00:33:34.445 --> 00:33:36.547
COMMERCIAL PLANS. CALIFORNIA IS

00:33:36.614 --> 00:33:38.750
FACING A SERIOUS MATERNAL HEALTH

00:33:38.816 --> 00:33:40.118
CRISIS. IN THE LAST DECADE

00:33:40.184 --> 00:33:41.986
ALONE, MORE THAN 50 HOSPITALS

00:33:42.053 --> 00:33:43.921
ACROSS THE STATE HAVE SHUT DOWN

00:33:43.988 --> 00:33:45.223
OR SUSPENDED THEIR LABOR AND

00:33:45.289 --> 00:33:47.692
DELIVERY SERVICES, CREATING

00:33:47.759 --> 00:33:50.595
MATERNITY CARE DESERTS TO MANY

00:33:50.661 --> 00:33:52.063
EXPECTANT MOTHERS ARE NOW FORCED

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:53.498
TO TRAVEL LONG DISTANCES TO

00:33:53.564 --> 00:33:55.266
REACH HOSPITALS EQUIPPED TO

00:33:55.333 --> 00:33:57.535
SAFELY DELIVER BABIES, SOMETIMES

00:33:57.602 --> 00:34:01.005
OVER AN HOUR OR 100 MILES. I

00:34:01.072 --> 00:34:02.540
CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH HOW

00:34:02.607 --> 00:34:04.675
DANGEROUS THESE DELAYS CAN BE.

00:34:04.742 --> 00:34:06.444
LACK OF TIMELY ACCESS

00:34:06.511 --> 00:34:07.845
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES RISK FOR

00:34:07.912 --> 00:34:10.348
PREMATURE BIRTHS, UNTREATED

00:34:10.415 --> 00:34:11.516
HYPERTENSION, AND MATERNAL

00:34:11.582 --> 00:34:13.618
DEATHS, ESPECIALLY FOR RURAL AND

00:34:13.684 --> 00:34:15.787
MINORITY COMMUNITIES. WHILE

00:34:15.853 --> 00:34:17.622
HEALTH PLANS MUST MEET TIME AND

00:34:17.688 --> 00:34:19.257
DISTANCE STANDARDS FOR PRIMARY

00:34:19.323 --> 00:34:22.360
CARE AND SPECIALTY CARE AND

00:34:22.427 --> 00:34:24.061
HOSPITALS, NO SUCH STANDARDS

00:34:24.128 --> 00:34:26.197
EXIST FOR LABOR AND DELIVERY

00:34:26.264 --> 00:34:28.800
UNITS. THIS GAP ALLOWS PLANS TO

00:34:28.866 --> 00:34:31.636
LIST OB-GYNS AS QUOTE AND

00:34:31.702 --> 00:34:33.438
NETWORK WITHOUT GUARANTEEING

00:34:33.504 --> 00:34:35.239
ACCESS TO ACTUAL DELIVERY

00:34:35.306 --> 00:34:38.743
SERVICES. THIS MISREPRESENTATION

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:41.279
OF ACCESS CAN CAUSE CONFUSION

00:34:41.345 --> 00:34:45.416
AND DELAY IN CRITICAL CARE. A

00:34:45.483 --> 00:34:47.118
MOTHER'S HEALTH MUST ALWAYS COME

00:34:47.185 --> 00:34:48.553
BEFORE ANY ADMINISTRATIVE

00:34:48.619 --> 00:34:50.321
BARRIERS. SOME MAY ARGUE THAT

00:34:50.388 --> 00:34:52.423
THIS BILL DOESN'T FIX THE ROOT

00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:54.225
CAUSE OF MATERNITY WARD

00:34:54.292 --> 00:34:55.960
CLOSURES. AND WHILE THAT'S TRUE

00:34:56.027 --> 00:34:57.462
THAT A HEALTH PLAN DOES NOT

00:34:57.528 --> 00:34:58.796
DIRECTLY MAKE THE FINAL

00:34:58.863 --> 00:35:00.698
DECISION, FINANCIAL STRAIN IS

00:35:00.765 --> 00:35:02.533
CREDITED AS A MAJOR FACTOR IN

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:05.069
THESE CLOSURES. SECURE AND

00:35:05.136 --> 00:35:06.471
SUSTAINABLE CONTRACTS CAN BE

00:35:06.537 --> 00:35:08.639
VITAL TO ENSURING PREDICTABLE

00:35:08.706 --> 00:35:10.541
REIMBURSEMENT AND STEADY PATIENT

00:35:10.608 --> 00:35:13.110
VOLUME, ESPECIALLY FOR SAFETY

00:35:13.177 --> 00:35:14.946
NET AND UNDER-RESOURCED

00:35:15.012 --> 00:35:16.447
HOSPITALS. SPECIFICALLY, THIS

00:35:16.514 --> 00:35:18.082
BILL WOULD ENCOURAGE PLANS TO

00:35:18.149 --> 00:35:19.884
ENGAGE MORE PROACTIVELY IN

00:35:19.951 --> 00:35:21.252
SUSTAINING LABOR AND DELIVERY

00:35:21.319 --> 00:35:22.720
SERVICES BY REQUIRING THE

00:35:22.787 --> 00:35:24.188
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

00:35:24.255 --> 00:35:25.923
SERVICES, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH,

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:27.458
MANAGED HEALTH CARE, AND THE

00:35:27.525 --> 00:35:28.926
DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE TO

00:35:28.993 --> 00:35:30.194
ENGAGE IN A ROBUST,

00:35:30.261 --> 00:35:31.462
COMPREHENSIVE STAKEHOLDER

00:35:31.529 --> 00:35:33.698
PROCESS TO DELIVERY TIME AND

00:35:33.764 --> 00:35:34.599
DISTANCE STANDARDS FOR LABOR AND

00:35:34.665 --> 00:35:37.068
DELIVERY UNITS. ENFORCEABLE

00:35:37.134 --> 00:35:39.203
STANDARDS WILL PUSH HEALTH PLANS

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:41.105
TO FIND CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO

00:35:41.172 --> 00:35:43.674
MAINTAIN HEALTH NETWORKS

00:35:43.741 --> 00:35:45.276
ADEQUACY AND ADDRESS MATERNITY

00:35:45.343 --> 00:35:47.545
WARD CLOSURES, INSTEAD OF

00:35:47.612 --> 00:35:50.147
DEFAULTING TO THE STATUS QUO. SB

00:35:50.214 --> 00:35:51.749
32 MANDATES GOOD FAITH EFFORTS

00:35:51.816 --> 00:35:53.951
FROM PLANS TO MAINTAIN NETWORKS

00:35:54.018 --> 00:35:55.353
THAT REFLECT THE REAL NEEDS OF

00:35:55.419 --> 00:35:57.688
PREGNANT PATIENTS AND PREVENT

00:35:57.755 --> 00:36:00.191
DANGEROUS GAPS IN ACCESS. TO BE

00:36:00.258 --> 00:36:01.893
CLEAR, THIS BILL WILL NOT BE THE

00:36:01.959 --> 00:36:03.628
ONLY THING THAT FIXED THIS

00:36:03.694 --> 00:36:05.196
MULTIFACETED, COMPLEX ISSUE

00:36:05.263 --> 00:36:06.597
SURROUNDING MATERNITY WARD

00:36:06.664 --> 00:36:09.066
CLOSURES. BUT IT IS ONE OF THE

00:36:09.133 --> 00:36:11.235
PIECES OF THE PUZZLE. BY

00:36:11.302 --> 00:36:12.937
REQUIRING TIMELY ACCESS TO

00:36:13.004 --> 00:36:15.339
PERINATAL UNITS, WE PROMOTE

00:36:15.406 --> 00:36:16.274
ACCOUNTABILITY, DRIVE

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:18.142
INNOVATION, AND PRIORITIZE

00:36:18.209 --> 00:36:21.379
PATIENT SAFETY AND EQUITY. SB 32

00:36:21.445 --> 00:36:23.814
REFLECTS A SIMPLE TRUTH HEALTHY

00:36:23.881 --> 00:36:25.349
BIRTHS ARE THE FOUNDATION OF

00:36:25.416 --> 00:36:27.885
HEALTHY COMMUNITIES. WITH ME

00:36:27.952 --> 00:36:30.021
TODAY, I HAVE DOCTOR PATRICE

00:36:30.087 --> 00:36:32.557
TROWBRIDGE, AN OB GYN

COLLEGE OF OBSTETRICIAN AND

00:36:35.459 --> 00:36:36.994
GYNECOLOGIST, AND VANESSA GOMEZ

00:36:37.061 --> 00:36:39.797

00:36:39.864 --> 00:36:42.266
ASSOCIATION. RESPECTFULLY ASK

00:36:42.333 --> 00:36:43.401
FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU.

00:36:43.467 --> 00:36:45.036
YOU'LL EACH HAVE TWO MINUTES

00:36:45.102 --> 00:36:47.672
EACH. ALL RIGHT. GOOD AFTERNOON,

00:36:47.738 --> 00:36:49.206
MADAM CHAIR. AND MEMBERS. MY

00:36:49.273 --> 00:36:50.508
NAME IS PATRICE TROWBRIDGE,

00:36:50.575 --> 00:36:51.709
DOCTOR PATRICE TROWBRIDGE. I'M

00:36:51.776 --> 00:36:53.244
AN OB GYN TESTIFYING ON BEHALF

00:36:53.311 --> 00:36:55.580
OF ACOG DISTRICT NINE, IN STRONG

00:36:55.646 --> 00:36:58.249
SUPPORT OF SB 32. EVERY DAY IN

00:36:58.316 --> 00:36:59.884
LABOR AND DELIVERY, WE WALK A

00:36:59.951 --> 00:37:01.452
TIGHTROPE OF PREDICTABILITY AND

00:37:01.519 --> 00:37:04.021
THE UNEXPECTED. A HEALTHY

00:37:04.088 --> 00:37:05.289
PREGNANCY CAN ESCALATE IN

00:37:05.356 --> 00:37:06.557
MINUTES. A BABY IN DISTRESS,

00:37:06.624 --> 00:37:08.225
SUDDEN HEMORRHAGE, OTHER

00:37:08.292 --> 00:37:10.294
UNDIAGNOSED COMPLICATIONS. THESE

00:37:10.361 --> 00:37:11.629
AREN'T RARE OR EXTREME CASES.

00:37:11.696 --> 00:37:12.797
THEY'RE PART OF OUR DAILY

00:37:12.863 --> 00:37:14.265
REALITY IN OBSTETRIC CARE.

00:37:14.332 --> 00:37:16.767
THAT'S WHY IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO A

00:37:16.834 --> 00:37:18.336
PROPERTY EQUIPPED WITH LABOR AND

00:37:18.402 --> 00:37:19.704
DELIVERY UNIT ISN'T A LUXURY.

00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:21.906
IT'S A MEDICAL NECESSITY.

00:37:21.973 --> 00:37:23.374
UNFORTUNATELY, TOO MANY OF MY

00:37:23.441 --> 00:37:24.842
COLLEAGUES AND PATIENTS NOW FACE

00:37:24.909 --> 00:37:26.544
A DEEPLY TROUBLING TREND. AND

00:37:26.611 --> 00:37:27.578
THAT'S THE DISAPPEARANCE OF

00:37:27.645 --> 00:37:30.514
NEARBY MATERNITY WARDS AND CARE.

00:37:30.581 --> 00:37:32.316
WHEN A PATIENT IN ACTIVE LABOR

00:37:32.383 --> 00:37:33.818
HAS NO IN-NETWORK FACILITY

00:37:33.884 --> 00:37:35.886
WITHIN REACH, THE RESULTS CAN BE

00:37:35.953 --> 00:37:37.388
DEVASTATING NOT JUST DELAYS IN

00:37:37.455 --> 00:37:39.223
CARE, BUT INCREASED PRETERM

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:40.558
BIRTHS, UNDIAGNOSED AND

00:37:40.625 --> 00:37:42.426
UNMANAGED HYPERTENSION, AND

00:37:42.493 --> 00:37:43.828
MATERNAL DEATHS THAT WERE

00:37:43.894 --> 00:37:46.731
PREVENTABLE. WHEN TIME IS THE

00:37:46.797 --> 00:37:48.833
MOST CRITICAL FACTOR, THE

00:37:48.899 --> 00:37:49.900
ABSENCE OF PROXIMITY BECOMES A

00:37:49.967 --> 00:37:54.972
LIFE THREATENING RISK. TODAY,

00:37:55.039 --> 00:37:56.240
HEALTH PLANS ARE REQUIRED TO

00:37:56.307 --> 00:37:57.742
ENSURE TIMELY ACCESS TO A BROAD

00:37:57.808 --> 00:37:59.543
ARRAY OF SERVICES, BUT THE VERY

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:01.545
SETTING WHERE BIRTHS OCCUR, THE

00:38:01.612 --> 00:38:02.713
PERINATAL UNIT IS MISSING FROM

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:04.682
THOSE STANDARDS. SB 32 WOULD FIX

00:38:04.749 --> 00:38:06.150
THAT AND ENSURE HEALTH PLANS

00:38:06.217 --> 00:38:08.085
MAKE THE SAME GOOD FAITH EFFORT

00:38:08.152 --> 00:38:09.020
TO SECURE LOCAL LABOR AND

00:38:09.086 --> 00:38:10.421
DELIVERY ACCESS AS THEY DO FOR

00:38:10.488 --> 00:38:12.289
OTHER TYPES OF CARE. TO BE

00:38:12.356 --> 00:38:13.791
CLEAR, THIS IS NOT ABOUT

00:38:13.858 --> 00:38:14.825
MANDATING NEW FACILITIES

00:38:14.892 --> 00:38:16.260
OVERNIGHT. IT'S ABOUT

00:38:16.327 --> 00:38:17.561
TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY,

00:38:17.628 --> 00:38:18.896
AND MAKING SURE HEALTH PLANS DO

00:38:18.963 --> 00:38:20.231
THEIR PART TO MAINTAIN A

00:38:20.297 --> 00:38:21.399
FUNCTIONAL NETWORK FOR ONE OF

00:38:21.465 --> 00:38:22.633
THE MOST BASIC HUMAN

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:23.901
EXPERIENCES, WHICH IS

00:38:23.968 --> 00:38:25.569
CHILDBIRTH. AS PHYSICIANS, WE

00:38:25.636 --> 00:38:27.271
ARE ASKED TO DO EVERYTHING WE

00:38:27.338 --> 00:38:28.706
CAN TO SAFEGUARD OUR PATIENTS

00:38:28.773 --> 00:38:30.408
HEALTH, TO DO NO HARM. AND WE'RE

00:38:30.474 --> 00:38:32.677
SIMPLY ASKING THE SAME FOR OUR

00:38:32.743 --> 00:38:34.178
HEALTH PLANS. WE ASK FOR AN AYE

00:38:34.245 --> 00:38:37.248
VOTE. THANK YOU. YOU'LL HAVE TWO

00:38:37.314 --> 00:38:39.216
MINUTES. GOOD AFTERNOON. VANESSA

00:38:39.283 --> 00:38:40.551
GONZALEZ WITH THE CALIFORNIA

00:38:40.618 --> 00:38:42.153
HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION HERE IN

00:38:42.219 --> 00:38:44.689
SUPPORT OF SB 32. DECLINING

00:38:44.755 --> 00:38:47.324
BIRTH RATES, WORKFORCE SHORTAGES

00:38:47.391 --> 00:38:49.293
AND FINANCIAL INSTABILITY HAVE

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:50.761
LEFT SOME HOSPITALS WITH NO

00:38:50.828 --> 00:38:52.196
CHOICE BUT TO CLOSE MATERNITY

00:38:52.263 --> 00:38:54.365
CARE SERVICES IN ORDER TO KEEP

00:38:54.432 --> 00:38:56.167
THEIR DOORS OPEN. THIS, OF

00:38:56.233 --> 00:38:57.635
COURSE, IS A SIGNIFICANT

00:38:57.702 --> 00:38:59.070
CONCERN, AND WE NEED ALL

00:38:59.136 --> 00:39:00.638
STAKEHOLDERS WORKING TOGETHER TO

00:39:00.705 --> 00:39:02.406
LOOK AT HOW WE CAN PRESERVE AND

00:39:02.473 --> 00:39:05.209
EXPAND LABOR AND DELIVERY CARE.

00:39:05.276 --> 00:39:06.510
ONE TOOL TO HELP ACHIEVE THIS IS

00:39:06.577 --> 00:39:08.312
THE ADOPTION AND MEANINGFUL

00:39:08.379 --> 00:39:10.281
ENFORCEMENT OF TIMELY ACCESS

00:39:10.347 --> 00:39:12.383
STANDARDS FOR LABOR AND DELIVERY

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:15.519
UNITS, AS PROPOSED IN SB 32.

00:39:15.586 --> 00:39:16.787
CALIFORNIA HAS IMPLEMENTED

00:39:16.854 --> 00:39:18.422
NETWORK ADEQUACY STANDARDS TO

00:39:18.489 --> 00:39:19.557
ENSURE HEALTH PLAN ENROLLEES

00:39:19.623 --> 00:39:21.826
HAVE TIMELY ACCESS TO THE CARE

00:39:21.892 --> 00:39:23.160
THAT THEY NEED. WHILE PLANS ARE

00:39:23.227 --> 00:39:24.562
CURRENTLY SUBJECT TO GENERAL

00:39:24.628 --> 00:39:26.764
HOSPITAL NETWORK ADEQUACY

00:39:26.831 --> 00:39:27.631

00:39:27.698 --> 00:39:29.366
CURRENTLY NO SPECIFIC TIME AND

00:39:29.433 --> 00:39:30.768
DISTANCE STANDARDS FOR HOSPITAL

00:39:30.835 --> 00:39:33.237

00:39:33.304 --> 00:39:35.406

ENFORCEABLE TIME AND DISTANCE

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.609
STANDARDS FOR L AND D SERVICES,

00:39:38.676 --> 00:39:40.845
SB 32 WILL HELP ENSURE THAT

00:39:40.911 --> 00:39:42.146
PATIENTS HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE,

00:39:42.213 --> 00:39:44.482
HIGH QUALITY MATERNITY CARE.

00:39:44.548 --> 00:39:46.250
WHILE SB 32 ALONE WILL NOT SOLVE

00:39:46.317 --> 00:39:48.385
ALL OF THE CHALLENGES,

00:39:48.452 --> 00:39:49.653
ESTABLISHING THIS NEW STANDARD

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:51.555
IS A CRITICAL FIRST STEP TOWARD

00:39:51.622 --> 00:39:53.057
IDENTIFYING AND ADDRESSING GAPS

00:39:53.124 --> 00:39:55.025

SENATOR. I KNOW THAT SINCE YOU

YOU HAVE JOINED THE LEGISLATURE,

00:41:32.056 --> 00:41:33.557
YOU'VE SOUGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:41:33.624 --> 00:41:36.327
YOUR EXPERTISE AS A PRACTICING

00:41:36.393 --> 00:41:37.962

00:41:38.028 --> 00:41:40.464
ARE ABLE TO RELY ON. AND I WANT

00:41:40.531 --> 00:41:41.999

00:41:42.066 --> 00:41:43.968
VERY DOGGED AND PERSISTENT ABOUT

00:41:44.034 --> 00:41:46.203

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:51.308
MANY YEARS, WE'VE HEARD

00:41:51.375 --> 00:41:52.209
CERTAINLY SEEING THE NEWS

00:41:52.276 --> 00:41:53.344
REPORTS, THAT THE RECENT

00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:54.612
CLOSURES IN OUR MATERNITY WARDS

00:41:54.678 --> 00:41:56.180
AND HOSPITAL LABOR AND DELIVERY

00:41:56.247 --> 00:41:57.281
SERVICES ARE SOMETHING THAT WE

00:41:57.348 --> 00:41:59.717
REALLY HAVE TO EXAMINE AND DO

00:41:59.783 --> 00:42:00.751
SOMETHING ABOUT VERY CRITICALLY.

00:42:00.818 --> 00:42:02.219

WILLINGNESS TO KEEP MOVING US

00:42:04.154 --> 00:42:06.357

ALLOWING FOR IT TO BE HEARD?

00:42:16.066 --> 00:42:17.301
THIS, UNFORTUNATELY, IS

00:42:17.368 --> 00:42:18.836
SOMETHING THAT HAS PROBABLY

00:42:18.903 --> 00:42:19.870
TOUCHED EACH AND EVERY

00:42:19.937 --> 00:42:22.706

WHETHER IT'S RURAL OR URBAN OR

00:42:25.476 --> 00:42:27.444
SUBURBAN. AND THIS IS A TREND

00:42:27.511 --> 00:42:29.380
THAT HAS TO STOP FOR THE HEALTH

00:42:29.446 --> 00:42:31.015
OF OUR ENTIRE STATE. AND WITH

00:42:31.081 --> 00:42:32.683
THAT, I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN

RIGHT. GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU

00:43:18.329 --> 00:43:20.331
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT

00:43:20.397 --> 00:43:22.166
TODAY. I WANT TO EXTEND MY

00:43:22.232 --> 00:43:23.434
SINCERE THANKS FOR THE COMMITTEE

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:25.436
AND STAFF FOR THEIR THOUGHTFUL

00:43:25.502 --> 00:43:27.538
ENGAGEMENT ON THIS BILL. WE

00:43:27.604 --> 00:43:29.039
ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS,

00:43:29.106 --> 00:43:30.174
WHICH WILL PROVIDE FURTHER

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:31.508
CLARITY AND STRENGTHEN THE

00:43:31.575 --> 00:43:35.546
OVERALL BILL. I'M HERE TO

00:43:35.612 --> 00:43:37.715
PRESENT SB 646, WHICH WOULD HELP

00:43:37.781 --> 00:43:38.882
PROTECT MATERNAL AND FETAL

00:43:38.949 --> 00:43:40.951
HEALTH BY ADDRESSING TOXIC

00:43:41.018 --> 00:43:42.353
ELEMENT CONTAMINATION AND

00:43:42.419 --> 00:43:44.121
PRENATAL VITAMINS, A CRITICAL

00:43:44.188 --> 00:43:45.990
BUT CURRENTLY UNREGULATED HEALTH

00:43:46.056 --> 00:43:48.092
RISK. PRENATAL VITAMINS ARE

00:43:48.158 --> 00:43:49.660
ESSENTIAL TO SUPPORTING HEALTHY

00:43:49.727 --> 00:43:51.662
PREGNANCIES. THEY PROVIDE VITAL

00:43:51.729 --> 00:43:54.198
NUTRIENTS LIKE FOLIC ACID, IRON,

00:43:54.264 --> 00:43:56.000
IODINE AND ARE RECOMMENDED IN

00:43:56.066 --> 00:43:58.135
NEARLY EVERY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION

00:43:58.202 --> 00:43:59.403
FOR PREVENTING BIRTH DEFECTS AND

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:01.872
PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS. BUT WE

00:44:01.939 --> 00:44:03.507
MUST ALSO ENSURE THAT THESE

00:44:03.574 --> 00:44:04.875
MULTIVITAMINS DO NOT EXPOSE

00:44:04.942 --> 00:44:06.477
PREGNANT INDIVIDUALS OR THEIR

00:44:06.543 --> 00:44:09.013
BABIES TO TOXIC SUBSTANCE.

00:44:09.079 --> 00:44:10.014
UNFORTUNATELY, RECENT STUDIES

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:11.882
HAVE REVEALED ALARMING LEVELS OF

00:44:11.949 --> 00:44:13.217
HEAVY METALS, INCLUDING LEAD,

00:44:13.283 --> 00:44:15.152
ARSENIC, CADMIUM AND MERCURY IN

00:44:15.219 --> 00:44:18.288
PRENATAL VITAMINS. THE GAO FOUND

00:44:18.355 --> 00:44:19.757
LEAD IN HALF OF ALL SAMPLED

00:44:19.823 --> 00:44:21.792
PRENATAL VITAMINS, AND OTHER

00:44:21.859 --> 00:44:23.160
INDEPENDENT STUDIES HAVE FOUND

00:44:23.227 --> 00:44:25.095
PRODUCTS EXCEEDING CALIFORNIA'S

00:44:25.162 --> 00:44:28.032
PROPOSITION 65 LIMITS. THESE

00:44:28.098 --> 00:44:30.200
TOXIC ELEMENTS ARE WELL

00:44:30.267 --> 00:44:31.969
DOCUMENTED. ENVIRONMENTAL

00:44:32.036 --> 00:44:34.671
CONTAMINANTS. LEAD, FOR EXAMPLE,

00:44:34.738 --> 00:44:36.740
IS UNSAFE AT ANY LEVEL OF

00:44:36.807 --> 00:44:37.841
EXPOSURE, AND EVEN LOW LEVELS

00:44:37.908 --> 00:44:39.510
DURING PREGNANCY ARE ASSOCIATED

00:44:39.576 --> 00:44:41.545
WITH MISCARRIAGE, STILLBIRTH,

00:44:41.612 --> 00:44:43.981
LOW BIRTH WEIGHT, AND LONG TERM

00:44:44.048 --> 00:44:45.049
DEVELOPMENTAL HARM FOR THE

00:44:45.115 --> 00:44:47.051
CHILD. DESPITE THIS, THERE ARE

00:44:47.117 --> 00:44:48.952
CURRENTLY NO FEDERAL OR STATE

00:44:49.019 --> 00:44:50.087
REGULATIONS REQUIRING

00:44:50.154 --> 00:44:51.422
MANUFACTURERS TO TEST PRENATAL

00:44:51.488 --> 00:44:54.091
VITAMINS FOR TOXIC ELEMENTS OR

00:44:54.158 --> 00:44:55.559
TO DISCLOSE THE RESULTS TO

00:44:55.626 --> 00:44:59.530
CONSUMERS. SB 646 FILLS THE GAPS

00:44:59.596 --> 00:45:01.231
BY REQUIRING MANUFACTURERS TO

00:45:01.298 --> 00:45:03.133
TEST EACH LOT OF THE BULK

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.568
PRENATAL VITAMIN PRODUCT FOR

00:45:04.635 --> 00:45:06.570
LEAD, ARSENIC, CADMIUM, AND

00:45:06.637 --> 00:45:08.672
MERCURY. IT WOULD REQUIRE PUBLIC

00:45:08.739 --> 00:45:10.207
DISCLOSURE OF TESTING RESULTS

00:45:10.274 --> 00:45:12.709
ONLINE BEGINNING JANUARY 1ST,

00:45:12.776 --> 00:45:14.578
2027, AND WOULD PROHIBIT THE

00:45:14.645 --> 00:45:17.748
SALE OF SALE OR DISTRIBUTION OF

00:45:17.815 --> 00:45:19.183
NON-COMPLIANT PRENATAL VITAMIN

00:45:19.249 --> 00:45:21.785
PRODUCTS IN THE STATE OF

00:45:21.852 --> 00:45:22.820
CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL DOES NOT

00:45:22.886 --> 00:45:24.655
BAN PRENATAL VITAMINS THAT MAY

00:45:24.721 --> 00:45:27.124
HAVE TOXIC ELEMENTS. IT SIMPLY

00:45:27.191 --> 00:45:29.226
ENSURES THAT THEY ARE TESTED AND

00:45:29.293 --> 00:45:30.627
TRANSPARENT OF THEIR CONTENTS.

00:45:30.694 --> 00:45:32.896
IT GIVES CONSUMERS AND HEALTH

00:45:32.963 --> 00:45:33.931
PROVIDERS THE INFORMATION THEY

00:45:33.997 --> 00:45:37.901
NEED TO CHOOSE SAFER OPTION, AND

00:45:37.968 --> 00:45:39.403
INCENTIVIZES MANUFACTURERS TO

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:41.138
CLEAN UP THEIR CHAINS, THEIR

00:45:41.205 --> 00:45:44.074
SUPPLY CHAINS AND PRIORITIZE LOW

00:45:44.141 --> 00:45:46.944
TOXICITY. SOURCING. SB 646

00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:48.445
SIMPLY EMPOWERS CONSUMERS WITH

00:45:48.512 --> 00:45:50.114
THE TRUTH. IT ALIGNS WITH

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:52.316
FEDERAL TESTING DEFINITION AND

00:45:52.382 --> 00:45:54.485
COMPLEMENTS EXISTING GMP

00:45:54.551 --> 00:45:56.687
PROTOCOLS. WE ARE ALSO AN OPEN

00:45:56.753 --> 00:45:58.822
AND ONGOING DISCUSSIONS WITH

00:45:58.889 --> 00:45:59.957
STAKEHOLDERS WHO HAVE RAISED

00:46:00.023 --> 00:46:01.391
CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL, AND WE

00:46:01.458 --> 00:46:03.260
DO REMAIN COMMITTED TO FINDING

00:46:03.327 --> 00:46:04.361
COMMON GROUND AND STRENGTHENING

00:46:04.428 --> 00:46:07.097
THE BILL WHEN NEEDED. PROVIDING

00:46:07.164 --> 00:46:10.000
TESTIMONY HERE FOR SB 646 IS

00:46:10.067 --> 00:46:12.236
SUSAN LITTLE, SENIOR LEGISLATIVE

00:46:12.302 --> 00:46:13.137
ADVOCATE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

00:46:13.203 --> 00:46:14.972
WORKING GROUP, AND DOCTOR

00:46:15.038 --> 00:46:16.673
TROWBRIDGE IS STAYING WITH US

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:19.443
REPRESENTING ACOG. REQUEST AN

00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:21.612
AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

00:46:21.678 --> 00:46:24.081
YOU'LL EACH HAVE TWO MINUTES.

00:46:24.148 --> 00:46:25.382
ALL RIGHT. GOOD AFTERNOON,

00:46:25.449 --> 00:46:26.617
DOCTOR TROWBRIDGE AGAIN

00:46:26.683 --> 00:46:28.318
REPRESENTING ACOG DISTRICT NINE.

00:46:28.385 --> 00:46:30.988
SO SB 646 IS A CRITICAL MEASURE

00:46:31.054 --> 00:46:32.890
TO PROTECT MATERNAL AND FETAL

00:46:32.956 --> 00:46:34.892
HEALTH BY ENSURING BOTH

00:46:34.958 --> 00:46:35.893
TRANSPARENCY AND SAFETY IN OUR

00:46:35.959 --> 00:46:37.327
PRENATAL VITAMINS. ONE OF THE

00:46:37.394 --> 00:46:39.196
FIRST QUESTIONS I GET AT

00:46:39.263 --> 00:46:40.330
PRENATAL VISIT IS WHAT PRENATAL

00:46:40.397 --> 00:46:41.899
VITAMINS SHOULD I TAKE AND WHAT

00:46:41.965 --> 00:46:43.634
FOODS SHOULD I AVOID? THOSE ARE

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:45.969
ALL IMPORTANT TO US. AS A

00:46:46.036 --> 00:46:47.037
PHYSICIAN, I ROUTINELY COUNSEL

00:46:47.104 --> 00:46:48.572
MY PATIENTS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF

00:46:48.639 --> 00:46:50.274
PRENATAL VITAMINS. THEY'RE

00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:51.308
ESSENTIAL. AGAIN, AS DOCTOR

00:46:51.375 --> 00:46:52.843
WEBER SAID, FOR FETAL

00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:53.544
DEVELOPMENT, MATERNAL

00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:55.112
WELL-BEING. AND IT'S SIMPLY

00:46:55.179 --> 00:46:56.780
THEY'RE NOT ADEQUATE IN AN

00:46:56.847 --> 00:46:58.882
AMERICAN DIET. THESE VITAMINS

00:46:58.949 --> 00:47:00.684
PROVIDE KEY NUTRIENTS LIKE FOLIC

00:47:00.751 --> 00:47:02.586
ACID, IRON AND OTHER

00:47:02.653 --> 00:47:03.220
MICRONUTRIENTS THAT HELP REDUCE

00:47:03.287 --> 00:47:05.522
THE RISK OF BIRTH DEFECTS, LOW

00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:07.624
BIRTH WEIGHT, OTHER PREGNANCY

00:47:07.691 --> 00:47:08.926
COMPLICATIONS. THEY'RE ESSENTIAL

00:47:08.992 --> 00:47:11.295
TO OUR CARE. ALSO ESSENTIAL TO

00:47:11.361 --> 00:47:12.663
PRENATAL CARE IS COUNSELING.

00:47:12.729 --> 00:47:14.631
WHAT TO AVOID I TELL MY PATIENTS

00:47:14.698 --> 00:47:16.300
THAT THEY SHOULD AVOID FOODS

00:47:16.366 --> 00:47:18.101
THAT ARE HIGH IN MERCURY, OR

00:47:18.168 --> 00:47:20.003
HIGHLY PROCESSED FOODS THAT MAY

00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:21.305
BE HIGHER IN ARSENIC LIKE

00:47:21.371 --> 00:47:24.474
SALMON, BUT THEY UNKNOWINGLY ARE

00:47:24.541 --> 00:47:25.876
LIKELY INGESTING MERCURY AND

00:47:25.943 --> 00:47:27.411
OTHER TOXIC ELEMENTS IN THEIR

00:47:27.477 --> 00:47:29.513
PRENATAL VITAMINS. WHEN I MAKE

00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:30.347
RECOMMENDATIONS TO MY PATIENTS,

00:47:30.414 --> 00:47:32.449
I NEED TO BE CERTAIN THAT WHAT I

00:47:32.516 --> 00:47:33.884
ADVISE IS BOTH EFFECTIVE AND

00:47:33.951 --> 00:47:35.419
SAFE. IT'S A MATTER OF TRUST

00:47:35.485 --> 00:47:36.787
BETWEEN A PHYSICIAN AND A

00:47:36.853 --> 00:47:37.821
PATIENT, AND THAT'S WHY SB 646

00:47:37.888 --> 00:47:39.990
IS SO IMPORTANT. RECENT STUDIES

00:47:40.057 --> 00:47:41.458
HAVE SHOWN THIS DEEPLY TROUBLING

00:47:41.525 --> 00:47:43.260
INFORMATION THAT THESE TOXIC

00:47:43.327 --> 00:47:44.962
ELEMENTS HAVE BEEN FOUND IN

00:47:45.028 --> 00:47:45.796
PRENATAL VITAMINS, AND THEY'RE

00:47:45.862 --> 00:47:47.497
NOT NEGLIGIBLE CONTAMINANTS.

00:47:47.564 --> 00:47:49.266
EVEN LOW LEVEL EXPOSURES CAN

00:47:49.333 --> 00:47:52.569
HAVE CAN HARM A DEVELOPING FETUS

00:47:52.636 --> 00:47:55.038
AND CAUSE THESE BIRTH DEFECTS

00:47:55.105 --> 00:47:56.940
AND DELAY DEVELOPMENTAL

00:47:57.007 --> 00:47:59.243
DISORDERS, CAUSE DEVELOPMENTAL

00:47:59.309 --> 00:48:01.211
DISORDERS AND DEVELOPMENTAL

00:48:01.278 --> 00:48:02.546
DELAYS. GIVEN THESE RISKS, BOTH

00:48:02.613 --> 00:48:04.414
PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS MUST HAVE

00:48:04.481 --> 00:48:06.116
ACCESS TO ACCURATE AND TIMELY

00:48:06.183 --> 00:48:07.651
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S IN

00:48:07.718 --> 00:48:08.418
THESE PRODUCTS BEFORE A

00:48:08.485 --> 00:48:10.120
RECOMMENDATION OR PURCHASE IS

00:48:10.187 --> 00:48:11.588
MADE. THIS BILL IS SIMPLE. IT'S

00:48:11.655 --> 00:48:13.991
JUST DEMANDING TRANSPARENCY, AND

00:48:14.057 --> 00:48:15.225
IT REQUIRES MANUFACTURERS TO

00:48:15.292 --> 00:48:16.493
TEST THEIR PRODUCTS AND DISCLOSE

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:18.128
THE RESULTS SO PEOPLE CAN MAKE

00:48:18.195 --> 00:48:21.064
INFORMED DECISIONS. FOR THESE

00:48:21.131 --> 00:48:22.499
REASONS, ACOG URGES YOU TO

00:48:22.566 --> 00:48:25.636
SUPPORT SB 646 AND TO EMPOWER

00:48:25.702 --> 00:48:27.070
CONSUMERS AND PROTECT FUTURE

00:48:27.137 --> 00:48:28.639
GENERATIONS FROM PREVENTABLE,

00:48:28.705 --> 00:48:30.340
TOXIC EXPOSURES. I APPRECIATE

00:48:30.407 --> 00:48:32.342
YOUR TIME, AND I'M ASKING FOR AN

00:48:32.409 --> 00:48:40.851
AYE VOTE ON THIS. THANK YOU.

00:48:40.917 --> 00:48:42.719
GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS SUSAN

ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP, ONE

00:48:46.723 --> 00:48:50.227
OF THE CO-SPONSORS OF SB 646.

00:48:50.294 --> 00:48:51.461
BECAUSE TOXIC ELEMENTS CAN HARM

00:48:51.528 --> 00:48:53.330
CHILDREN'S NERVOUS SYSTEMS.

00:48:53.397 --> 00:48:55.198
EXTRA CAUTION SHOULD BE TAKEN TO

00:48:55.265 --> 00:48:56.800
ENSURE THAT DEVELOPING FETUSES

00:48:56.867 --> 00:48:58.869
ARE NOT EXPOSED TO THESE

00:48:58.935 --> 00:48:59.836
ELEMENTS. HOWEVER, THE

00:51:42.299 --> 00:51:43.733
KHN IS THE LEADING TRADE

00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:45.135
ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING DIETARY

00:51:45.202 --> 00:51:46.937
SUPPLEMENTS AND FUNCTIONAL FOOD

00:51:47.003 --> 00:51:47.737
MANUFACTURERS, AS WELL AS

00:51:47.804 --> 00:51:49.906
INGREDIENT SUPPLIERS. WILL WE

00:51:49.973 --> 00:51:51.308
APPRECIATE THE SENATOR'S INTENT

00:51:51.374 --> 00:51:53.810
WITH SB 646? UNFORTUNATELY, KHN

00:51:53.877 --> 00:51:55.579
IS OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED. LET

00:51:55.645 --> 00:51:57.047
ME START BY SAYING THAT

00:51:57.113 --> 00:51:58.415
MANUFACTURERS DO NOT ADD THESE

00:51:58.482 --> 00:51:59.850
ELEMENTS TO THEIR PRENATAL

00:51:59.916 --> 00:52:01.151
VITAMINS. RATHER, MANY OF THE

00:52:01.218 --> 00:52:02.352
INGREDIENTS IN PRENATAL

00:52:02.419 --> 00:52:03.887
VITAMINS, INCLUDING CRITICAL

00:52:03.954 --> 00:52:06.089
NUTRIENTS SUCH AS CALCIUM AND

00:52:06.156 --> 00:52:07.424
MAGNESIUM, COME FROM NATURAL

00:52:07.491 --> 00:52:09.960
SOURCES IN THE SOIL, MANY OF

00:52:10.026 --> 00:52:11.795
WHICH THESE ELEMENTS HEAVY

00:52:11.862 --> 00:52:13.763
ELEMENTS, ARE UBIQUITOUS. SO THE

00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:15.665
SAME IS TRUE FOR FRUITS AND

00:52:15.732 --> 00:52:16.533
VEGETABLES, MANY OF WHICH

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:17.567
CONTAIN TRACE LEVELS OF THESE

00:52:17.634 --> 00:52:19.402
ELEMENTS. DUE TO SOIL UPTAKE. WE

00:52:19.469 --> 00:52:20.737
HAVE TWO PRIMARY CONCERNS WITH

00:52:20.804 --> 00:52:22.572
THE BILL AS DRAFTED. FIRST,

00:52:22.639 --> 00:52:23.607
WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THE BILL

00:52:23.673 --> 00:52:25.342
MAY DISSUADE EXPECTANT MOTHERS

00:52:25.408 --> 00:52:27.177
FROM TAKING PRENATAL VITAMINS

00:52:27.244 --> 00:52:28.778
WHEN THEY SEE THAT THEY COULD

00:52:28.845 --> 00:52:30.080
CONTAIN HEAVY METALS. BUT

00:52:30.146 --> 00:52:31.615
PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE'RE

00:52:31.681 --> 00:52:32.649
VERY CONCERNED THAT THE BILL

00:52:32.716 --> 00:52:34.351
WOULD ATTRACT EXPECTANT MOTHERS

00:52:34.417 --> 00:52:35.919
TO PURCHASE PRENATAL VITAMINS

00:52:35.986 --> 00:52:38.121
THAT CONTAIN NO OR INSUFFICIENT

00:52:38.188 --> 00:52:39.489
CRITICAL NUTRIENTS, LIKE CALCIUM

00:52:39.556 --> 00:52:41.625
AND MAGNESIUM. TO PROVIDE AN

00:52:41.691 --> 00:52:43.360
EXAMPLE OF THIS, THE PROPONENTS

00:52:43.426 --> 00:52:44.928
OF THIS MEASURE HAVE POINTED TO

00:52:44.995 --> 00:52:46.663
PRENATAL VITAMINS THAT CONTAIN

00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:48.999
OR ARE PROMOTING LOW HEAVY METAL

00:52:49.065 --> 00:52:51.001
CONTENT, BUT THOSE PRENATAL

00:52:51.067 --> 00:52:52.335
VITAMINS DON'T CONTAIN

00:52:52.402 --> 00:52:53.870
SUFFICIENT LEVELS OF CRITICAL

00:52:53.937 --> 00:52:55.305
NUTRIENTS THAT EXPECTANT MOTHERS

00:52:55.372 --> 00:52:57.641
NEED. FOR EXAMPLE, ONE CONTAINS

00:52:57.707 --> 00:52:59.242
NO CALCIUM AND INSUFFICIENT

00:52:59.309 --> 00:53:01.545
LEVELS OF MAGNESIUM, ANOTHER

00:53:01.611 --> 00:53:03.613
CONTAINS NO MAGNESIUM OMEGA

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:04.981
THREE AND INSUFFICIENT LEVELS OF

00:53:05.048 --> 00:53:06.683
CALCIUM. SO IN THE END,

00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:08.018
EXPECTANT MOTHERS TAKING THOSE

00:53:08.084 --> 00:53:09.185
PRENATAL VITAMINS WOULD NEED TO

00:53:09.252 --> 00:53:11.254
MAKE UP THOSE SHORTFALLS THROUGH

00:53:11.321 --> 00:53:12.522
THEIR DIET. EATING SIGNIFICANT

00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:13.990
AMOUNTS OF FOOD SUCH AS LEAFY

00:53:14.057 --> 00:53:15.859
GREENS, WHICH ALSO CONTAIN HEAVY

00:53:15.926 --> 00:53:18.728
LEVEL EXPOSURE. THE SENATE

00:53:18.795 --> 00:53:20.096
ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEE

00:53:20.163 --> 00:53:21.264
ANALYSIS CONTEMPLATED THIS,

00:53:21.331 --> 00:53:23.300
NOTING THAT IF THIS BILL WERE TO

00:53:23.366 --> 00:53:24.467
BE ENACTED, IT'S POSSIBLE THAT

00:53:24.534 --> 00:53:25.969
MANUFACTURERS WILL REMOVE KEY

00:53:26.036 --> 00:53:28.204
INGREDIENTS TO LOWER LEVELS OF

00:53:28.271 --> 00:53:29.472
CONTAMINATION WHILE ALSO

00:53:29.539 --> 00:53:30.740
REMOVING CRITICAL NUTRIENTS IF

00:53:30.807 --> 00:53:32.442
THEY'RE NOT AVAILABLE IN OTHER

00:53:32.509 --> 00:53:33.877
INGREDIENTS. THE ANALYSIS

00:53:33.944 --> 00:53:34.911
FURTHER STATED THAT MORE

00:53:34.978 --> 00:53:36.079
ENGAGEMENT SURROUNDING THIS

00:53:36.146 --> 00:53:37.480
CONCERN WILL BE NECESSARY TO

00:53:37.547 --> 00:53:39.149
ENSURE THAT BY PROTECTING

00:53:39.215 --> 00:53:40.450
PREGNANT INDIVIDUALS, POLICIES

00:53:40.517 --> 00:53:41.851
AREN'T INADVERTENTLY HURTING

00:53:41.918 --> 00:53:43.920
THEM. WE KNOW THAT WE SHARE THIS

00:53:43.987 --> 00:53:45.388
CONCERN WITH THE SENATOR, AND WE

00:53:45.455 --> 00:53:46.790
ARE VERY CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN

00:53:46.856 --> 00:53:48.892
GET TO A RIGHT PLACE AND STRIKE

00:53:48.959 --> 00:53:50.660
A RIGHT BALANCE WITH THIS BILL.

00:53:50.727 --> 00:53:52.128
SO LOOKING FORWARD TO CONTINUED

00:53:52.195 --> 00:53:54.097
CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOG. THANK YOU.

00:53:54.164 --> 00:53:56.166
YOU'LL HAVE TWO MINUTES. GOOD

00:53:56.232 --> 00:53:57.200
AFTERNOON, TRENT SMITH, ON

00:53:57.267 --> 00:53:58.368
BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER

00:53:58.435 --> 00:53:59.669
HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION,

00:53:59.736 --> 00:54:01.871
WHICH IS THE COMPANIES WHO

00:54:01.938 --> 00:54:02.939
MANUFACTURE OVER-THE-COUNTER

00:54:03.006 --> 00:54:05.208
DRUGS AND DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS.

00:54:05.275 --> 00:54:06.977
I'D LIKE TO ASSOCIATE MY

00:54:07.043 --> 00:54:08.778
COMMENTS WITH MISS LEE'S

00:54:08.845 --> 00:54:10.947
COMMENTS. WE ARE CONCERNED THAT

00:54:11.014 --> 00:54:12.949
IF THIS BILL WERE ENACTED, AS IT

00:54:13.016 --> 00:54:14.551
CURRENTLY IS DRAFTED, THAT IT

00:54:14.618 --> 00:54:17.887
WILL BECOME A DETRIMENT TO

00:54:17.954 --> 00:54:19.189
PUBLIC HEALTH RATHER THAN A

00:54:19.255 --> 00:54:20.590
POSITIVE IN THE FACT THAT,

00:54:20.657 --> 00:54:22.792
AGAIN, EXPECTANT MOTHERS MAY BE

00:54:22.859 --> 00:54:24.260
ATTRACTED TO A PARTICULAR

00:54:24.327 --> 00:54:26.363
PRODUCT THAT'S MARKETED AS HEAVY

00:54:26.429 --> 00:54:28.632
METAL FREE, BUT MAY NOT CONTAIN

00:54:28.698 --> 00:54:30.467
THE NUTRIENTS THAT I THINK WE

00:54:30.533 --> 00:54:32.569
ALL CAN AGREE ON ARE IMPORTANT

00:54:32.636 --> 00:54:34.771
FOR AN EXPECTANT MOTHER,

00:54:34.838 --> 00:54:36.573
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:38.108
SOME OF THE PRODUCTS THAT WE

00:54:38.174 --> 00:54:39.476
CONSUME ON A DAILY BASIS. AND

00:54:39.542 --> 00:54:41.544
THE DOCTORS RECOMMEND SPINACH,

00:54:41.611 --> 00:54:44.848
LEAFY GREENS ALL CONTAIN TRACES

00:54:44.914 --> 00:54:47.317
OF HEAVY METALS. AND YET WE'RE

00:54:47.384 --> 00:54:49.786
NOT CONTEMPLATING ANY LABELING

00:54:49.853 --> 00:54:51.287
REQUIREMENTS FOR THOSE TYPES OF

00:54:51.354 --> 00:54:52.989
PRODUCTS. I THINK MOST PEOPLE

00:54:53.056 --> 00:54:55.225
AGREE THOSE ARE GOOD, HEALTHY

00:54:55.291 --> 00:54:56.726
PRODUCTS AND DIETARY

00:54:56.793 --> 00:54:58.528
SUPPLEMENTS. PRENATAL VITAMINS

00:54:58.595 --> 00:55:00.630
IN PARTICULAR, HAVE BEEN USED

00:55:00.697 --> 00:55:02.399
SAFELY FOR DECADES, AND WE WANT

00:55:02.465 --> 00:55:04.934
PEOPLE TO CONTINUE TO USE THOSE

00:55:05.001 --> 00:55:06.770
PRODUCTS FOR GOOD HEALTH. AND

00:55:06.836 --> 00:55:08.471
WE'RE JUST AFRAID THAT THIS

00:55:08.538 --> 00:55:10.306
COULD BE MISINTERPRETED BY

00:55:10.373 --> 00:55:11.841
CONSUMERS AND HAVE THE OPPOSITE

00:55:11.908 --> 00:55:13.543
EFFECT OF WHAT I THINK THE

00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:15.278
AUTHOR INTENDS. SO WE REMAIN

00:55:15.345 --> 00:55:18.481
OPPOSED. WE HAVE HAD DISCUSSIONS

00:55:18.548 --> 00:55:20.150
WITH THE AUTHOR GOING BACK TO

00:55:20.216 --> 00:55:22.252
THE SENATE, AND WE'RE NOW HERE

00:55:22.318 --> 00:55:24.921
IN THE ASSEMBLY, AND HOPEFULLY

00:55:24.988 --> 00:55:25.488
WE CAN COME TO A RESOLUTION

00:55:25.555 --> 00:55:28.391
VERY, VERY SOON. THANK YOU.

00:55:28.458 --> 00:55:29.626
THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHERS

00:55:29.693 --> 00:55:31.161
IN OPPOSITION? PLEASE COME

00:55:31.227 --> 00:55:33.296
FORWARD. MADAM CHAIR ANTHONY

00:55:33.363 --> 00:55:35.365
MOLINA, ON BEHALF OF THE NATURAL

00:55:35.432 --> 00:55:36.199
PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION, IN

00:55:36.266 --> 00:55:37.233
OPPOSITION. THANK YOU, THANK

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:40.637
YOU. SEEING NO OTHER OPPOSITION,

00:55:40.704 --> 00:55:43.339
I WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE

00:55:43.406 --> 00:55:44.407
COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR

00:55:44.474 --> 00:55:48.111
COMMENTS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:55:48.178 --> 00:55:51.347
SCHIAVO, THANK YOU. I WANT TO

00:55:51.414 --> 00:55:53.183
THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS. IT'S

00:55:53.249 --> 00:55:54.751
PRETTY SHOCKING, THE STATISTICS

00:55:54.818 --> 00:55:56.753
THAT YOU SHARED AND REALLY

00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:58.888
CONCERNING, I GUESS, CAN YOU

00:55:58.955 --> 00:56:02.125
ADDRESS THE COMMENTS MADE BY

00:56:02.192 --> 00:56:03.626
OPPOSITION? I HEAR THEM SAYING

00:56:03.693 --> 00:56:05.729
TRACE ELEMENTS, TRACE ELEMENTS.

00:56:05.795 --> 00:56:07.964
SO WHAT IS THERE A DIFFERENCE

00:56:08.031 --> 00:56:09.566
BETWEEN WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

00:56:09.632 --> 00:56:10.700
REQUIRE AND WHAT THEY'RE TALKING

00:56:10.767 --> 00:56:12.368
ABOUT IS IN SPINACH. OKAY. THANK

00:56:12.435 --> 00:56:14.771
YOU. I'LL, I WILL LET SUSAN

00:56:14.838 --> 00:56:16.539
ANSWER THAT FROM THE

00:56:16.606 --> 00:56:20.844
ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP. SO.

00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:25.515
OF COURSE SO TRACE ELEMENTS OF

00:56:25.582 --> 00:56:29.552
THESE TOXIC, EXCUSE ME. LOW

00:56:29.619 --> 00:56:31.254
LEVELS OF THESE TOXIC ELEMENTS

00:56:31.321 --> 00:56:33.123
CAN BE FOUND IN DIFFERENT SOURCE

00:56:33.189 --> 00:56:35.258
ELEMENTS SOURCES. BUT IT ALL

00:56:35.325 --> 00:56:37.127
DEPENDS UPON WHAT THE WHERE THE

00:56:37.193 --> 00:56:39.028
ORIGIN OF THE SOURCES ARE. FOR

00:56:39.095 --> 00:56:41.231
INSTANCE, IN THE STUDY THAT WAS

00:56:41.297 --> 00:56:44.300
DONE BY THE UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI,

00:56:44.367 --> 00:56:46.336
THEY FOUND THAT 25% OF THE

00:56:46.402 --> 00:56:48.238
PRENATAL VITAMINS HAD LESS THAN

00:56:48.304 --> 00:56:50.774
ONE PART PER BILLION LEAD, AND

00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:52.509
SOME OF THEM HAD AS HIGH AS 100

00:56:52.575 --> 00:56:54.711
AS 900 PARTS PER BILLION LEAD.

00:56:54.778 --> 00:56:57.847
SO IT'S ALL ABOUT THE SOURCE

00:56:57.914 --> 00:56:58.948
MATERIALS, THE RAW MATERIALS

00:56:59.015 --> 00:57:00.850
THAT ARE REQUIRED. AND MANY OF

00:57:00.917 --> 00:57:02.786
THESE COMPANIES ALREADY TEST

00:57:02.852 --> 00:57:04.788
THEIR SOURCE MATERIALS TO MAKE

00:57:04.854 --> 00:57:06.256
SURE THAT THEY HAVE LOW LEVELS

00:57:06.322 --> 00:57:07.891
OF THESE TOXIC ELEMENTS. AND

00:57:07.957 --> 00:57:10.426
THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT WOULD BE

00:57:10.493 --> 00:57:11.461
NEEDED IS FOR THEM TO JUST BE

00:57:11.528 --> 00:57:14.030
MORE COGNIZANT AND MORE

00:57:14.097 --> 00:57:15.465
INTENTIONAL ABOUT THE SOURCE

00:57:15.532 --> 00:57:18.434
MATERIALS THEY USE TO CREATE TO

00:57:18.501 --> 00:57:21.671
PRODUCE THEIR VITAMINS. AND TO

00:57:21.738 --> 00:57:23.773
THAT POINT, LIKE I STATED IN IN

00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:25.275
MY OPENING STATEMENT, THIS IS

00:57:25.341 --> 00:57:27.277
NOT A BILL THAT PROHIBITS ANY

00:57:27.343 --> 00:57:29.779
PRENATAL VITAMIN. HOWEVER, IT

00:57:29.846 --> 00:57:32.115
DOES REQUIRE MORE TRANSPARENCY

00:57:32.182 --> 00:57:34.584
AND OPENNESS FOR PROVIDERS AND

00:57:34.651 --> 00:57:36.419
ALSO FOR PATIENTS. SO THAT IF

00:57:36.486 --> 00:57:37.787
I'M GOING AND I'M SEEING

00:57:37.854 --> 00:57:41.791
SOMETHING THAT HAS LESS TOXIC

00:57:41.858 --> 00:57:43.026
CHEMICALS OR ELEMENTS IN THERE,

00:57:43.092 --> 00:57:45.028
I MAY CHOOSE THAT ONE THAT DOES

00:57:45.094 --> 00:57:47.330
HAVE THE FULL GAMUT OF ALL OF

00:57:47.397 --> 00:57:48.431
THE NUTRIENTS THAT I NEED AND

00:57:48.498 --> 00:57:50.433
THAT MY OB GYN IS RECOMMENDING,

00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:51.734
BUT IT HAS LESS THAN ANOTHER ONE

00:57:51.801 --> 00:57:53.670
THAT HAS, AS SHE WAS STATING,

00:57:53.736 --> 00:57:55.572
YOU KNOW, NINE TIMES MORE THAN

00:57:55.638 --> 00:57:57.440
WHAT THE OTHER ONE HAS. SO THIS

00:57:57.507 --> 00:57:59.409
IS ABOUT TRANSPARENCY. THIS IS

00:57:59.475 --> 00:58:01.544
ABOUT PATIENTS HAVING THE

00:58:01.611 --> 00:58:02.579
OPPORTUNITY TO CHOOSE SOMETHING

00:58:02.645 --> 00:58:04.848
THAT IS SAFER AND HEALTHIER, AND

00:58:04.914 --> 00:58:07.417
ULTIMATELY HOPING THAT SINCE YOU

00:58:07.483 --> 00:58:09.519
CAN FIND SOME THAT DO A BETTER

00:58:09.586 --> 00:58:11.354
JOB, THAT HAVE ALL OF THE

00:58:11.421 --> 00:58:12.922
NUTRIENTS THAT ARE NEEDED, THAT

00:58:12.989 --> 00:58:15.992
MORE PEOPLE WOULD SOURCE FROM A

00:58:16.059 --> 00:58:17.794
SOMETHING THAT WAS CLEANER AND

00:58:17.861 --> 00:58:21.097
SAFER. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

00:58:21.164 --> 00:58:24.667
MEMBER CARROLL. THANKS SO MUCH

00:58:24.734 --> 00:58:27.103
FOR YOUR EXPERTISE ON THIS AND

00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:27.770
FOR BRINGING THIS BILL. SENATOR,

00:58:27.837 --> 00:58:29.272
THIS IS A FOLLOW UP ON MY

00:58:29.339 --> 00:58:31.074
COLLEAGUE'S QUESTION. AND I

00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:32.775
GUESS JUST KIND OF THINKING

00:58:32.842 --> 00:58:34.177
THROUGH THE OPPOSITION ARGUMENT

00:58:34.244 --> 00:58:38.348
HERE. ARE YOU NOT CONCERNED THAT

00:58:38.414 --> 00:58:40.884
PRODUCTS MAY FORGO IMPORTANT

00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:42.719
NUTRIENTS LIKE CALCIUM BECAUSE

00:58:42.785 --> 00:58:43.720
THEY'RE CONCERNED THAT THEN THEY

00:58:43.786 --> 00:58:45.421
WOULD HAVE TO ALSO DISCLOSE

00:58:45.488 --> 00:58:46.990
LEAD, AND THAT COULD DISSUADE

00:58:47.056 --> 00:58:48.391
PATIENTS FROM SEEKING THOSE

00:58:48.458 --> 00:58:50.493
PRODUCTS? THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH

00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:52.695
FOR THAT QUESTION. I AM NOT

00:58:52.762 --> 00:58:54.163
CONCERNED THAT A PRENATAL

00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:55.498
VITAMIN WOULD THEN AUTOMATICALLY

00:58:55.565 --> 00:58:56.833
OR COMPANY WOULD SAY, WELL,

00:58:56.900 --> 00:58:58.902
WE'RE NOT GOING TO INCLUDE

00:58:58.968 --> 00:59:00.403
CALCIUM OR SOMETHING, BECAUSE AS

00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:02.372
A PREGNANT PATIENT OR EVEN AS A

00:59:02.438 --> 00:59:04.240
PATIENT, I'M LOOKING AT THE

00:59:04.307 --> 00:59:05.808
BOTTLE TO SEE NOT ONLY ARE THERE

00:59:05.875 --> 00:59:07.110
POTENTIAL TOXIC ELEMENTS IF THIS

00:59:07.176 --> 00:59:08.912
BILL WERE TO PASS, BUT ALSO WHAT

00:59:08.978 --> 00:59:11.247
ELEMENTS ARE ARE IN THERE. AND

00:59:11.314 --> 00:59:12.815
SO IF I SEE A KEY INGREDIENT

00:59:12.882 --> 00:59:13.616
MISSING, THEN I WOULD NOT

00:59:13.683 --> 00:59:15.285
PURCHASE IT. JUST LIKE NOW WHEN

00:59:15.351 --> 00:59:16.686
YOU'RE GETTING A PRENATAL

00:59:16.753 --> 00:59:17.387
VITAMIN, YOU'RE LOOKING FOR

00:59:17.453 --> 00:59:19.455
SOMETHING OR A VITAMIN AND

00:59:19.522 --> 00:59:20.223
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING

00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:22.792
SPECIFIC. IF YOU GO TO ONE ONE

00:59:22.859 --> 00:59:24.093
THAT DOESN'T HAVE WHAT YOU'RE

00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:26.029
LOOKING FOR, YOU WON'T PURCHASE

00:59:26.095 --> 00:59:27.497
IT. YOU'LL GET ONE THAT HAS ALL

00:59:27.563 --> 00:59:28.798
OF THE ELEMENTS THAT YOU'RE

00:59:28.865 --> 00:59:31.901
LOOKING FOR. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:59:31.968 --> 00:59:34.771
PATEL, THANK YOU FOR BRINGING

00:59:34.837 --> 00:59:36.005
THIS BILL FORWARD. THERE HAVE

00:59:36.072 --> 00:59:37.440
BEEN MULTIPLE TIMES IN MY LIFE

00:59:37.507 --> 00:59:39.208
WHERE I'VE HAD TO GO HUNT FOR

00:59:39.275 --> 00:59:40.443
PRENATAL VITAMINS THAT HAVE ALL

00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:42.312
THE THINGS THAT MY PHYSICIAN

00:59:42.378 --> 00:59:43.880
RECOMMENDED THAT I HAD IN THEM,

00:59:43.947 --> 00:59:45.348
AND THANKFULLY, I WAS ABLE TO

00:59:45.415 --> 00:59:48.184
FIND THOSE SPECIFIC BOTTLES WITH

00:59:48.251 --> 00:59:49.686
THE OMEGA AND THE APPROPRIATE

00:59:49.752 --> 00:59:51.387
AMOUNTS OF FOLATE AND EVERYTHING

00:59:51.454 --> 00:59:53.256
ELSE. I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING

00:59:53.323 --> 00:59:54.791
THIS BILL FORWARD. I DO HAVE A

00:59:54.857 --> 00:59:56.392
COUPLE OF QUESTIONS, AND I THINK

00:59:56.459 --> 00:59:58.528
I SEE THAT YOU ARE WORKING WITH

00:59:58.594 --> 00:59:59.762
THE OPPOSITION TO MAKE SURE WE

00:59:59.829 --> 01:00:00.997
DO GET THIS RIGHT, BECAUSE WE

01:00:01.064 --> 01:00:02.465
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:00:02.532 --> 01:00:05.368
PRODUCT SUPPLY CHAIN IS

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:07.236
AVAILABLE. I'M GUESSING WE'RE

01:00:07.303 --> 01:00:09.906
WORKING ON MAKING SURE THAT WHEN

01:00:09.973 --> 01:00:11.274
THIS LAW TAKES EFFECT, THAT

01:00:11.341 --> 01:00:12.642
THERE WILL BE MANUFACTURERS OUT

01:00:12.709 --> 01:00:14.177
THERE MAKING IT. SO WHAT DO YOU

01:00:14.243 --> 01:00:16.779
SEE AS THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS

01:00:16.846 --> 01:00:20.116
BETWEEN GETTING ENOUGH OF THESE

01:00:20.183 --> 01:00:23.119
NUTRIENTS AND PERHAPS HAVING

01:00:23.186 --> 01:00:25.154
PATIENTS PAY A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:00:25.221 --> 01:00:26.923
TO FIND THAT MORE PURE SOURCING

01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:29.292
OF THOSE MINERALS AND VITAMINS

01:00:29.359 --> 01:00:31.961
IN A PRENATAL VITAMIN PILL

01:00:32.028 --> 01:00:34.197
VERSUS THE COST, FRANKLY, OF

01:00:34.263 --> 01:00:36.733
BEING EXPOSED TO HIGHER LEVELS

01:00:36.799 --> 01:00:39.535
PRENATALLY OF LEAD AND WHATEVER

01:00:39.602 --> 01:00:43.740
OTHER ARSENIC. I WILL LET SUSAN

01:00:43.806 --> 01:00:45.341
LITTLE ANSWER IT IN JUST A

01:00:45.408 --> 01:00:46.776
MOMENT. I SEE HER LOOKING AT ME.

01:00:46.843 --> 01:00:48.878
BUT I THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEING

01:00:48.945 --> 01:00:52.215
RIGHT NOW IS UNFORTUNATELY,

01:00:52.281 --> 01:00:54.450
ANOTHER AREA OF INEQUITY BASED

01:00:54.517 --> 01:00:56.919
ON SOCIO SOCIOECONOMIC INCOMES.

01:00:56.986 --> 01:00:59.055
SO RIGHT NOW YOU MAY BE ABLE TO

01:00:59.122 --> 01:01:01.958
GO AND FIND THAT ONE THAT HAS

01:01:02.025 --> 01:01:04.093
ALL OF THE NUTRIENTS THAT YOU

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:08.398
NEED AND A SOURCED BY A MORE

01:01:08.464 --> 01:01:10.233
ENVIRONMENTALLY COMPANY

01:01:10.299 --> 01:01:12.368
CONSCIOUS COMPANY THAT HAS LESS

01:01:12.435 --> 01:01:14.570
TOXIC, TOXIC MATERIALS WHERE

01:01:14.637 --> 01:01:16.339
SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T HAVE THOSE

01:01:16.406 --> 01:01:17.740
RESOURCES HAS TO GO AND GET

01:01:17.807 --> 01:01:19.942
SOMETHING THAT HAS MUCH MORE

01:01:20.009 --> 01:01:21.711
HEAVY METALS IN ORDER TO GET

01:01:21.778 --> 01:01:23.179
THAT. SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

01:01:23.246 --> 01:01:25.748
WOULD ALLOW FOR, LIKE I SAID,

01:01:25.815 --> 01:01:27.550
TRANSPARENCY WITH THE HOPE THAT

01:01:27.617 --> 01:01:29.752
EVERYONE IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE

01:01:29.819 --> 01:01:31.821
WOULD BE SOURCING FROM MORE

01:01:31.888 --> 01:01:33.956
ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS AREAS

01:01:34.023 --> 01:01:35.691
WHERE ALL OF THE TOXICITY LEVELS

01:01:35.758 --> 01:01:37.994
WILL BE AS LOW AS POSSIBLE. AND

01:01:38.061 --> 01:01:39.729
EVERYONE, REGARDLESS OF YOUR

01:01:39.796 --> 01:01:40.596
SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, WILL BE

01:01:40.663 --> 01:01:43.032
ABLE TO GET THE SAME TYPE OF

01:01:43.099 --> 01:01:43.833
PRENATAL VITAMIN. AND THAT'S NOT

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:46.269
WHAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY. IN OUR

01:01:46.335 --> 01:01:49.138
FIRST HEARING, WE HAD HILARY

01:01:49.205 --> 01:01:51.908
SWANK COME IN AND TESTIFY ON

01:01:51.974 --> 01:01:53.409
BEHALF OF THIS BILL, AND WHAT

01:01:53.476 --> 01:01:55.878
SHE CAN LOOK FOR IS VERY

01:01:55.945 --> 01:01:57.747
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE VAST

01:01:57.814 --> 01:02:00.083
MAJORITY OF PREGNANT WOMEN CAN

01:02:00.149 --> 01:02:02.385
CAN GET. BUT I WILL TURN IT OVER

01:02:02.452 --> 01:02:04.253
TO SUSAN LITTLE. I'LL JUST ADD

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:06.789
THAT THE BILL THAT WAS SIMILAR

01:02:06.856 --> 01:02:07.790
TO THIS, THAT WAS PASSED SEVERAL

01:02:07.857 --> 01:02:10.359
YEARS AGO, THAT REQUIRES TESTING

01:02:10.426 --> 01:02:13.196
AND DISCLOSURE FOR BABY FOOD

01:02:13.262 --> 01:02:14.564
THAT HAS SINCE BEEN IMPLEMENTED,

01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:16.532
AND WE HAVE NOT SEEN A RISE IN

01:02:16.599 --> 01:02:18.267
COST OF BABY FOOD, NOR HAVE WE

01:02:18.334 --> 01:02:20.436
SEEN PEOPLE NOT BUY BABY FOOD,

01:02:20.503 --> 01:02:22.905
OR NOR HAVE WE SEEN A LACK OF

01:02:22.972 --> 01:02:25.441
BABY FOOD. SO I THINK WE CAN.

01:02:25.508 --> 01:02:26.943
WHAT WE'VE SEEN INSTEAD IS THAT

01:02:27.009 --> 01:02:28.144
COMPANIES ARE BEING MORE

01:02:28.211 --> 01:02:29.679
INTENTIONAL ABOUT THE THEIR RAW

01:02:29.745 --> 01:02:32.248
MATERIALS AND HAVE BEEN WORKING

01:02:32.315 --> 01:02:34.117
TO REDUCE THEIR LEVELS OF THESE

01:02:34.183 --> 01:02:35.518
TOXIC ELEMENTS IN THOSE

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:37.320
PRODUCTS. THANK YOU FOR POINTING

01:02:37.386 --> 01:02:39.555
OUT THAT OTHER EXAMPLE. I THINK

01:02:39.622 --> 01:02:41.924
THAT'S HELPFUL WHEN WE TALK

01:02:41.991 --> 01:02:43.559
ABOUT WHAT THE OPPOSITION IS

01:02:43.626 --> 01:02:44.961
CONCERNED ABOUT, IT'S HELPFUL TO

01:02:45.027 --> 01:02:47.263
KNOW THAT WE DO HAVE VERY

01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:48.865
RESPONSIBLE MANUFACTURERS WHO

01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:50.633
WILL WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:52.168
BASIC INGREDIENTS MEET THE

01:02:52.235 --> 01:02:54.203
LEVELS OF PURITY REQUIRED AND

01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:57.573
ARE NECESSARY FOR WOMEN WHO ARE

01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:59.308
PREGNANT. ANOTHER BASIC

01:02:59.375 --> 01:03:01.277
QUESTION. AND SENATOR, MAYBE YOU

01:03:01.344 --> 01:03:03.212
CAN HELP ME UNDERSTAND THIS. I

01:03:03.279 --> 01:03:05.047
JUST DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO

01:03:05.114 --> 01:03:06.315
THIS QUESTION. I COULD PROBABLY

01:03:06.382 --> 01:03:07.583
LOOK IT UP, BUT YOU'RE THE

01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:09.552
EXPERT IN THE ROOM. I'M GUESSING

01:03:09.619 --> 01:03:10.153
PRENATAL VITAMINS AREN'T. ARE

01:03:10.219 --> 01:03:12.555
THEY COVERED UNDER MEDI-CAL OR

01:03:12.622 --> 01:03:19.862
INSURANCE CURRENTLY? GENERALLY

01:03:19.929 --> 01:03:22.398
NOT, BUT OCCASIONALLY THEY ARE.

01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:25.001
AND SO ANYTIME I CAN SEND A

01:03:25.067 --> 01:03:25.902
PRESCRIPTION, I TRY TO, BUT

01:03:25.968 --> 01:03:28.070
OFTEN THEY IT ENDS UP BEING AN

01:03:28.137 --> 01:03:29.138
OVER-THE-COUNTER. AND THEN THE

01:03:29.205 --> 01:03:30.673
PRESCRIPTION IS LIMITED TO

01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:32.108
WHATEVER THAT PHARMACY HAS IN

01:03:32.175 --> 01:03:34.610
SUPPLY. IT'S LIKE A11 ITEM SHOP.

01:03:34.677 --> 01:03:36.679
AND WE OFTEN DON'T EVEN KNOW

01:03:36.746 --> 01:03:39.148
WHAT THAT ITEM IS GOING TO BE.

01:03:39.215 --> 01:03:40.783
YEAH, IT'S VERY INSURANCE

01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:42.185
DEPENDENT. THE VAST MAJORITY OF

01:03:42.251 --> 01:03:43.452
PATIENTS DO END UP PAYING FOR IT

01:03:43.519 --> 01:03:46.622
OVER THE COUNTER. AND THOSE THAT

01:03:46.689 --> 01:03:48.658
DO ARE ABLE TO GET IT FROM

01:03:48.724 --> 01:03:49.692
PRESCRIPTION. IT IS A BASIC

01:03:49.759 --> 01:03:52.695
GENERIC TYPE. AND SO AGAIN THIS

01:03:52.762 --> 01:03:54.830
BILL WOULD ACTUALLY ASSIST IN

01:03:54.897 --> 01:03:56.933
THOSE INDIVIDUALS AS WELL.

01:03:56.999 --> 01:03:57.900
CERTAINLY THE EQUITY ISSUE IS

01:03:57.967 --> 01:03:59.402
VERY IMPORTANT TO ME, MAKING

01:03:59.468 --> 01:04:02.104
SURE ALL MOTHERS HAVE ACCESS TO

01:04:02.171 --> 01:04:03.239
APPROPRIATE PRENATAL CARE. THANK

01:04:03.306 --> 01:04:06.509
YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT

01:04:06.576 --> 01:04:08.444
QUESTION. I ACTUALLY WAS JUST

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:11.180
CONFERRING WITH OUR CONSULTANT,

01:04:11.247 --> 01:04:12.815
OUR CHIEF CONSULTANT HERE,

01:04:12.882 --> 01:04:14.417
BECAUSE WE DID JUST IN THE STATE

01:04:14.483 --> 01:04:16.319
OF CALIFORNIA, THE BUDGET ACT

01:04:16.385 --> 01:04:19.889
THAT WE JUST PASSED, IT IS UNDER

01:04:19.956 --> 01:04:23.125
REVIEW WHETHER OR NOT MEDI-CAL

01:04:23.192 --> 01:04:25.728
WOULD COVER OVER-THE-COUNTER

01:04:25.795 --> 01:04:27.563
PRENATAL VITAMINS. AND I THINK

01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:29.599
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE

01:04:29.665 --> 01:04:30.700
OUR BUDGET SUB CHAIR HERE, WHO'S

01:04:30.766 --> 01:04:34.303
GOING TO LOOK INTO THAT MORE?

01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:36.205
SENATOR, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR

01:04:36.272 --> 01:04:39.008
BRINGING FORWARD THIS BILL. IT

01:04:39.075 --> 01:04:40.743
WAS CERTAINLY OFFERED A LOT OF

01:04:40.810 --> 01:04:44.080
ROBUST CONVERSATIONS IN

01:04:44.146 --> 01:04:45.815
COMMITTEE AND WITH SOME OF THE

01:04:45.881 --> 01:04:47.250
STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED HERE. I

01:04:47.316 --> 01:04:50.152
THINK ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WAS

01:04:50.219 --> 01:04:52.288
RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION THAT I

01:04:52.355 --> 01:04:55.224
ALSO THINK WARRANTS SOME

01:04:55.291 --> 01:04:57.727
ADDRESSING IS THIS CONCEPT THAT

01:04:57.793 --> 01:04:59.895
THE PRENATAL VITAMINS THAT ARE

01:04:59.962 --> 01:05:01.664
CURRENTLY ON THE MARKET THAT DO

01:05:01.731 --> 01:05:05.268
NOT HAVE THE TRACE LEVELS OF

01:05:05.334 --> 01:05:07.837
LEAD, ARSENIC, CADMIUM AND

01:05:07.903 --> 01:05:10.573
MERCURY AND OTHERS ALSO DO NOT

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:12.908
HAVE THE REQUISITE LEVEL OF

01:05:12.975 --> 01:05:14.377
NUTRITIONAL VALUE THAT THEY NEED

01:05:14.443 --> 01:05:15.478
IN ORDER TO BE CONSIDERED A

01:05:15.544 --> 01:05:17.513
PRENATAL VITAMIN. THIS BILL, AS

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:21.117
IT STANDS NOW, I THINK OUR

01:05:21.183 --> 01:05:22.518
RECOMMENDATION WAS THAT THAT

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:23.619
ESSENTIALLY KIND OF FALLS

01:05:23.686 --> 01:05:25.488
OUTSIDE OF THE FOUR CORNERS OF

01:05:25.554 --> 01:05:27.556
THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION, BUT

01:05:27.623 --> 01:05:29.859
CAN YOU JUST SPEAK TO THE NEED

01:05:29.925 --> 01:05:32.495
TO ALSO ADDRESS THAT PRODUCT OUT

01:05:32.561 --> 01:05:33.729
THERE THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE

01:05:33.796 --> 01:05:35.498
CORRECT LEVELS THAT WE NEED?

01:05:35.564 --> 01:05:37.600
YEAH. SO THOSE ARE THAT IS A

01:05:37.667 --> 01:05:38.467
PART OF OUR DISCUSSION, BECAUSE

01:05:38.534 --> 01:05:40.503
WE DEFINITELY DON'T WANT ANYONE

01:05:40.569 --> 01:05:42.371
TO BE TAKING ANY PRENATAL

01:05:42.438 --> 01:05:43.472
VITAMINS THAT DO NOT HAVE THE

01:05:43.539 --> 01:05:45.675
BASIC ELEMENTS THAT YOU NEED OR

01:05:45.741 --> 01:05:47.710
THAT WE AS OB-GYNS, RECOMMEND.

01:05:47.777 --> 01:05:49.478
AND SO THAT HAS BEEN A PART OF

01:05:49.545 --> 01:05:50.713
OUR CONVERSATION, AND WE WILL

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:53.182
FIGURE OUT HOW TO FIX THAT.

01:05:53.249 --> 01:05:56.819
GREAT. I APPRECIATE THAT. AND I

01:05:56.886 --> 01:05:58.654
ALSO JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR

01:05:58.721 --> 01:06:00.389
BRINGING THIS FORWARD. WE HAD A

01:06:00.456 --> 01:06:02.825
SIMILAR BILL LAST YEAR ON A

01:06:02.892 --> 01:06:05.428
RELATED TOPIC. WELL, ACTUALLY IT

01:06:05.494 --> 01:06:07.363
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH VITAMINS,

01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:09.632
BUT HAD TO DO WITH WHAT PREGNANT

01:06:09.699 --> 01:06:12.101
PEOPLE INGEST AND THERE TURN OUT

01:06:12.168 --> 01:06:14.036
TO BE VERY COMPLICATED. SO I

01:06:14.103 --> 01:06:16.605
ALWAYS APPRECIATE WHEN WE HAVE A

01:06:16.672 --> 01:06:18.774
PRACTITIONER WHO CAN WALK US

01:06:18.841 --> 01:06:21.577
THROUGH THE IMPLICATIONS OF, OF

01:06:21.644 --> 01:06:23.512
THESE PIECES OF LEGISLATION TO

01:06:23.579 --> 01:06:25.247
BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD. I JUST

01:06:25.314 --> 01:06:26.649
WANT TO ASK ANOTHER QUESTION IF

01:06:26.716 --> 01:06:30.486
IT'S OKAY. SO WHAT, AS AN OB OB

01:06:30.553 --> 01:06:34.557
GUY, DO YOU TELL YOUR PATIENTS

01:06:34.623 --> 01:06:36.826
REGARDING PRENATAL VITAMINS AND

01:06:36.892 --> 01:06:40.629
THE CONSUMPTION OF THEIR OTHER

01:06:40.696 --> 01:06:42.832
KIND OF THE REST OF THEIR DIET?

01:06:42.898 --> 01:06:44.633
SO I THINK MY COLLEAGUE KIND OF

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:46.602
TOUCHED ON THAT. AS TO WHAT WE

01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:47.803
SAY, WE DEFINITELY RECOMMEND

01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:49.939
PRENATAL VITAMINS. AND HONESTLY,

01:06:50.005 --> 01:06:51.273
PRIOR TO THIS BILL, I HADN'T

01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:52.975
EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT THE FACT THAT

01:06:53.042 --> 01:06:57.513
THERE WERE TOXIC LEVELS OF

01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:59.815
MERCURY AND CADMIUM AND ALL OF

01:06:59.882 --> 01:07:01.851
THOSE THINGS. SO DEFINITELY

01:07:01.917 --> 01:07:03.052
RECOMMEND PRENATAL VITAMINS

01:07:03.119 --> 01:07:04.854
ACTUALLY, PRIOR TO CONCEPTION

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:06.956
PRIOR, I MEAN, BEFORE YOU GET

01:07:07.022 --> 01:07:10.226
PREGNANT AND YOU HAVE TO BE VERY

01:07:10.292 --> 01:07:12.728
CAREFUL OF VERY PROCESSED FOODS,

01:07:12.795 --> 01:07:16.332
YOU KNOW, DELI MEATS, WATCH THE

01:07:16.399 --> 01:07:17.900
AMOUNT OF SALMON AND OTHER KIND

01:07:17.967 --> 01:07:18.501
OF FISHES THAT YOU'RE EATING

01:07:18.567 --> 01:07:20.269
BECAUSE OF THE CONTAMINATION

01:07:20.336 --> 01:07:22.405
THAT THEY HAVE. BUT THERE'S NO

01:07:22.471 --> 01:07:23.873
EXPECTATION THAT A PRENATAL

01:07:23.939 --> 01:07:26.375
VITAMIN PROVIDES ALL OF THE

01:07:26.442 --> 01:07:28.344
NUTRIENTS. OH, NO. YEAH. NO. AND

01:07:28.411 --> 01:07:29.745
WE DEFINITELY NEVER TELL ANYONE

01:07:29.812 --> 01:07:32.047
THAT. ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS ONLY

01:07:32.114 --> 01:07:32.615
TAKE PRENATAL VITAMINS. YOU

01:07:32.681 --> 01:07:34.016
DEFINITELY NEED TO CONTINUE WITH

01:07:34.083 --> 01:07:35.851
YOUR REGULAR FRUITS AND

01:07:35.918 --> 01:07:36.886
VEGETABLES AND YOUR AND YOUR

01:07:36.952 --> 01:07:39.188
LEAFY, YOU KNOW, YOUR GREENS AND

01:07:39.255 --> 01:07:41.490
THINGS LIKE THAT. BUT WE NEVER,

01:07:41.557 --> 01:07:43.259
NEVER TELL ANYONE THAT ALL YOU

01:07:43.325 --> 01:07:44.260
NEED IS YOUR PRENATAL VITAMIN.

01:07:44.326 --> 01:07:46.328
JUST LIKE WE DON'T TELL PEOPLE.

01:07:46.395 --> 01:07:48.364
ALL YOU NEED IS JUST YOUR DAILY

01:07:48.431 --> 01:07:49.198
MULTIVITAMIN. AND IT IS THE CASE

01:07:49.265 --> 01:07:51.434
THAT SOME OF THOSE LEAFY GREENS

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:53.469
GREENS MIGHT ALSO CONTAIN THE

01:07:53.536 --> 01:07:54.870
TRACE ELEMENTS THAT, DEPENDING

01:07:54.937 --> 01:07:56.906
ON WHERE THEY'RE SOURCED FROM.

01:07:56.972 --> 01:07:59.208
YEAH. WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT I

01:07:59.275 --> 01:08:00.643
APPRECIATE THAT. I THINK WE HAVE

01:08:00.709 --> 01:08:09.552
QUORUM NOW. SO WE'LL ESTABLISH

01:08:09.618 --> 01:08:10.152

BILL 313. I'M COMMITTED TO

01:11:28.050 --> 01:11:29.518
CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE

01:11:29.585 --> 01:11:30.586
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO

01:11:30.653 --> 01:11:32.421
ENSURE THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF

01:11:32.488 --> 01:11:33.722
PARENT BIRTHPLACE. INFORMATION

01:11:33.789 --> 01:11:35.991
IS UPHELD BY THIS BILL, AND TO

01:11:36.058 --> 01:11:37.326
EXPLORE ANY FURTHER AVENUES

01:11:37.393 --> 01:11:39.261
NECESSARY TO ENSURE ITS INTENT

01:11:39.328 --> 01:11:42.731
IS MET. SB 313 IS A VITAL STEP

01:11:42.798 --> 01:11:44.033
TOWARD PROTECTING THE PRIVACY

01:11:44.099 --> 01:11:46.368
AND SECURITY OF CALIFORNIA

01:11:46.435 --> 01:11:47.369
FAMILIES. IT MAKES IT

01:11:47.436 --> 01:11:49.004
STRAIGHTFORWARD BUT IMPORTANT

01:11:49.071 --> 01:11:50.606
CHANGE. IT MOVES THE BIRTHPLACE

01:11:50.673 --> 01:11:52.174
OF A CHILD'S PARENT FROM THE

01:11:52.241 --> 01:11:53.976
PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE PORTION OF A

ONLY BY AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS.

01:11:59.748 --> 01:12:01.417
THIS IS MORE THAN AN

01:12:01.483 --> 01:12:02.251
ADMINISTRATIVE FIX. IT'S A

01:12:02.317 --> 01:12:04.053
MATTER OF PERSONAL PRIVACY AND

01:12:04.119 --> 01:12:06.288
DATA SECURITY, ESPECIALLY IN A

01:12:06.355 --> 01:12:07.823
TIME WHEN SENSITIVE INFORMATION

01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:09.858
IS TOO OFTEN WEAPONIZED. WHAT

01:12:09.925 --> 01:12:11.326
MIGHT SEEM LIKE A SMALL DETAIL,

01:12:11.393 --> 01:12:12.761
THE BIRTHPLACE OF A PARENT CAN

01:12:12.828 --> 01:12:15.130
BE MISUSED TO TARGET PROFILE

01:12:15.197 --> 01:12:16.865
DISCRIMINATE. CURRENT LAW

01:12:16.932 --> 01:12:19.168
REQUIRES EACH LIVE BIRTH TO BE

01:12:19.234 --> 01:12:20.135
REGISTERED WITH THE LOCAL

01:12:20.202 --> 01:12:21.970

THAT INFORMATION SUCH AS PARENTS

PRACTICES FOR DATA PRIVACY. IT

01:13:13.655 --> 01:13:16.325
IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE SB 313 DOES

01:13:16.391 --> 01:13:17.426
NOT LIMIT THE DEPARTMENT OF

AMENDMENTS IN IN ASSEMBLY

01:17:06.488 --> 01:17:09.458
JUDICIARY. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW,

FARM WORKERS, MANY OF THEM ALSO

01:17:14.062 --> 01:17:16.498

01:17:22.371 --> 01:17:23.205
HEARTBREAKING STORIES OF WORKERS

JUST TO KEEP FOOD ON OUR TABLES.

01:17:28.343 --> 01:17:29.778
THEY DESERVE BETTER. AS CLIMATE

01:17:29.845 --> 01:17:31.646
CHANGE EXPANDS. VALLEY FEVER IS

01:17:31.713 --> 01:17:33.315
NO LONGER A REGIONAL ISSUE.

01:17:33.382 --> 01:17:35.217
CASES ARE RISING, ESPECIALLY

01:17:35.283 --> 01:17:37.052
AMONG OUTDOOR WORKERS AND

01:17:37.119 --> 01:17:39.287
VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. YET THE

01:17:39.354 --> 01:17:41.256
DISEASE REMAINS WIDELY

01:17:41.323 --> 01:17:42.824
UNDERDIAGNOSED. THIS IS NOT JUST

01:17:42.891 --> 01:17:44.993
A HEALTH ISSUE, IT'S AN ECONOMIC

01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:47.462
ONE. MISSED WORKED HIGH MEDICAL

01:17:47.529 --> 01:17:48.430

OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR

01:17:51.933 --> 01:17:54.202
COMMUNITIES. ABOUT 200 AMERICANS

01:17:54.269 --> 01:17:57.205
DIE EACH YEAR FROM VALLEY FEVER.

01:17:57.272 --> 01:18:00.842
MORE ACTION NEEDS TO BE TAKEN.

01:18:00.909 --> 01:18:02.210

GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M DOCTOR

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:13.588
GEORGE THOMPSON. I'M A PROFESSOR

01:18:13.655 --> 01:18:15.023
OF MEDICINE AT UC DAVIS MEDICAL

01:18:15.090 --> 01:18:16.324
CENTER, AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF

01:18:16.391 --> 01:18:17.993
THE UC DAVIS CENTER FOR VALLEY

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:19.594
FEVER. AND I'M TASKED WITH THE

01:18:19.661 --> 01:18:20.462
RESEARCH AND CARE OF PATIENTS

01:18:20.529 --> 01:18:22.330
WITH THE MOST SEVERE FORMS OF

01:18:22.397 --> 01:18:23.565
DISEASE FROM NOT ONLY LOCALLY

01:18:23.632 --> 01:18:25.734
BUT ACROSS THE GLOBE. WITH THE

01:18:25.801 --> 01:18:26.368
ADVENT OF TELEMEDICINE. THERE'S

01:18:26.435 --> 01:18:27.102
SOME ESSENTIAL PARTS OF THIS

01:18:27.169 --> 01:18:28.470
BILL I THINK ARE REALLY

01:18:28.537 --> 01:18:29.638
IMPORTANT. VALLEY FEVER, AS MOST

01:18:29.704 --> 01:18:31.606
OF YOU KNOW, IS NAMED AFTER THE

01:18:31.673 --> 01:18:32.307
CENTRAL VALLEY OF CALIFORNIA,

01:18:32.374 --> 01:18:34.309
WHERE IT GOT ITS NAME. BUT THE

01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:35.977
INCIDENCE AND CHANGES IN SAN

01:18:36.044 --> 01:18:37.145
LUIS OBISPO COUNTY NOW, THE

01:18:37.212 --> 01:18:38.947
DISEASE HAS VERY QUICKLY SPREAD

01:18:39.014 --> 01:18:41.349
TO NEW AREAS OF CALIFORNIA AND

01:18:41.416 --> 01:18:43.085
ALSO FAR NORTHWARD. WE SEE CASES

01:18:43.151 --> 01:18:44.986
NOW LOCALLY ACQUIRED IN REDDING.

01:18:45.053 --> 01:18:46.221
AND WITH CLIMATE CHANGE, WE'RE

01:18:46.288 --> 01:18:47.456
SEEING CASES MOVE FURTHER AND

01:18:47.522 --> 01:18:49.257
FURTHER FROM THEIR TYPICAL

01:18:49.324 --> 01:18:51.093
REGION, SUCH AS IN SOUTH

01:18:51.159 --> 01:18:52.394
SACRAMENTO. AND WE HAVE WIND

01:18:52.461 --> 01:18:54.062
EVENTS AND OTHER STORMS. WE SEE

01:18:54.129 --> 01:18:55.130
LOCALLY ACQUIRED CASES NOW AS

01:18:55.197 --> 01:18:57.632
WELL. SO A FURTHER UNDERSTANDING

01:18:57.699 --> 01:18:58.233
OF THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF DISEASE

01:18:58.300 --> 01:19:00.435
IS REALLY A BIG PART OF THIS,

01:19:00.502 --> 01:19:01.837
WITH WHAT'S TASKED WITH THE

01:19:01.903 --> 01:19:02.671
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH,

01:19:02.737 --> 01:19:04.106
WITH TESTING AND REPORTING, I

01:19:04.172 --> 01:19:05.407
THINK THAT'S REALLY ESSENTIAL AS

01:19:05.474 --> 01:19:07.142
WE CAN EDUCATE PHYSICIANS AND

01:19:07.209 --> 01:19:08.376
PATIENTS ALIKE. A LOT OF OUR

01:19:08.443 --> 01:19:10.145
PHYSICIANS DO MOVE FROM NON

01:19:10.212 --> 01:19:12.380
CALIFORNIA PLACES HERE. SO HOW

01:19:12.447 --> 01:19:14.349
TO EDUCATE BOTH THEM AND THE

01:19:14.416 --> 01:19:15.016
PATIENTS IS REALLY OF PARAMOUNT

01:19:15.083 --> 01:19:17.385
IMPORTANCE IN THIS. AND THEN THE

01:19:17.452 --> 01:19:18.320
COMPLICATED PATIENTS I SEE ARE

01:19:18.386 --> 01:19:19.621
TYPICALLY THOSE WHO HAVE A

01:19:19.688 --> 01:19:20.956
DELAYED DIAGNOSIS. SO HAVING

01:19:21.022 --> 01:19:22.657
THOSE PATIENTS DIAGNOSED EARLIER

01:19:22.724 --> 01:19:24.626
IS REALLY ESSENTIAL FOR THE CARE

01:19:24.693 --> 01:19:26.528
OF THESE PATIENTS. IF WE CAN GET

01:19:26.595 --> 01:19:27.963
THEM ON THERAPY EARLIER, THEIR

01:19:28.029 --> 01:19:28.830
SYMPTOMS WILL PRESUMABLY

01:19:28.897 --> 01:19:30.298
DECREASE MORE RAPIDLY AND GET

01:19:30.365 --> 01:19:32.634
THEM BACK TO WORK, BACK TO

01:19:32.701 --> 01:19:33.802
SCHOOL AND THE THINGS THEY NEED

01:19:33.869 --> 01:19:35.670
TO BE DOING. THANKS SO MUCH.

01:21:09.898 --> 01:21:12.601
MEMBER ADDIS I WANT TO THANK THE

01:21:12.667 --> 01:21:13.568
AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS

01:21:13.635 --> 01:21:15.370
FORWARD. I KNOW THAT VALLEY

01:21:15.437 --> 01:21:16.805
FEVER STARTED IN THE CENTRAL

01:21:16.871 --> 01:21:17.906
VALLEY, BUT IT HAS QUICKLY

01:21:17.973 --> 01:21:20.075
SPREAD TO THE CENTRAL COAST,

01:21:20.141 --> 01:21:21.676
WHERE I REPRESENT IN MONTEREY

01:21:21.743 --> 01:21:24.112
AND SAN OBISPO, AND MUCH TO THE

01:21:24.179 --> 01:21:25.413
SOUTHERN PART OF THE CENTRAL

01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:27.749
COAST. AND SO REALLY APPRECIATE

01:21:27.816 --> 01:21:30.185
ALL THAT WE CAN DO TO GET A HOLD

01:21:30.252 --> 01:21:31.753
ON THIS. IT'S BEEN VERY, VERY

01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:33.154
DETRIMENTAL TO OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:21:33.221 --> 01:21:35.323
SO THANK YOU. AND I SUPPORT AND

01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:38.226
I'M HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL MOVED

01:21:38.293 --> 01:21:42.931
BY ADDIS SECONDED BY PATEL. OH

01:21:42.998 --> 01:21:45.300
SORRY A QUESTION. GO AHEAD.

01:21:45.367 --> 01:21:47.869
ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATEL, THANK YOU

01:21:47.936 --> 01:21:49.004
FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD.

01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:51.406
IT ADDRESSES A CRITICAL CONCERN

01:21:51.473 --> 01:21:53.241
IN ICU CARE VERY DEEPLY ABOUT

01:21:53.308 --> 01:21:55.410
YOUR COMMUNITY, AND I'D LIKE TO

01:21:55.477 --> 01:21:56.411
SEE WHEN BILLS COME DIRECTLY

01:21:56.478 --> 01:21:58.880
FROM WORK IN THE COMMUNITY. I DO

01:21:58.947 --> 01:21:59.414
HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS. I'M

01:21:59.481 --> 01:22:01.516
LOOKING THROUGH THE BILL IN

01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:02.951
LIGHT OF YOU ACCEPTING

01:22:03.018 --> 01:22:04.552
AMENDMENTS THAT ARE COMING YOUR

01:22:04.619 --> 01:22:05.553
WAY FROM THE OPPOSITION, OR

01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:08.189
BEING OPEN TO THAT, WHAT DOES

01:22:08.256 --> 01:22:09.758
ADDING A SCREENING, WHAT WHAT IS

01:22:09.824 --> 01:22:11.660
THE SCREENING? WHAT IS ADDING A

01:22:11.726 --> 01:22:13.461
SCREENING MEAN WHEN WE SAY THAT

01:22:13.528 --> 01:22:16.298
THERE WILL BE A SCREENING OR A

01:22:16.364 --> 01:22:19.100
TEST WHEN A PATIENT COMES IN?

01:22:19.167 --> 01:22:20.735
YEAH, THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.

01:22:20.802 --> 01:22:22.304
SO WE, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE

01:22:22.370 --> 01:22:24.072
CDC HAVE PROPOSED AND IT'S BEEN

01:22:24.139 --> 01:22:25.774
PUBLISHED NOW THE ALGORITHM FOR

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:26.875
SCREENING FOR ALL PATIENTS. IT'S

01:22:26.941 --> 01:22:28.410
A SIMPLE BLOOD TEST. THERE'S A

01:22:28.476 --> 01:22:30.312
VERY RAPID ONE THAT'S DONE AT

01:22:30.378 --> 01:22:31.546
THE LARGE REFERENCE LABS AROUND

01:22:31.613 --> 01:22:33.348
THE COUNTRY. AND THEN THERE'S A

01:22:33.415 --> 01:22:34.249
CONFIRMATORY TEST AFTER THAT.

01:22:34.316 --> 01:22:35.917
AND THAT'S DONE BY THREE LABS

01:22:35.984 --> 01:22:37.252
AROUND THE COUNTRY. SO I DON'T

01:22:37.319 --> 01:22:38.920
THINK THERE'S A WORKFLOW ISSUE.

01:22:38.987 --> 01:22:39.888
ALL THOSE LABS COULD EASILY

01:22:39.954 --> 01:22:41.456
HANDLE A HUNDRED FOLD MORE

01:22:41.523 --> 01:22:43.992
VOLUME. SO DOES THAT MEAN WHEN A

01:22:44.059 --> 01:22:45.026
PATIENT COMES IN AND PRESENTS

01:22:45.093 --> 01:22:47.495
WITH FEVER OF SOME KIND, NOT

01:22:47.562 --> 01:22:49.130
KNOWING THE SOURCE OF THAT

01:22:49.197 --> 01:22:50.532
FEVER, THEY WOULD AUTOMATICALLY

01:22:50.598 --> 01:22:52.567
BE SENT TO LABCORP OR SOME KIND

01:22:52.634 --> 01:22:54.769
OF LAB, MAYBE AN INTERNAL CLINIC

01:22:54.836 --> 01:22:57.639
LAB FOR A BLOOD DRAW BE SENT

01:22:57.706 --> 01:22:59.341
HOME. QUARANTINE? I DON'T KNOW.

01:22:59.407 --> 01:23:01.142
IT'S NOT CONTAGIOUS. NOT

01:23:01.209 --> 01:23:03.812
CONTAGIOUS? NO. SO. AND THEN

01:23:03.878 --> 01:23:06.247
WAIT TWO DAYS FOR THEIR REPORT

01:23:06.314 --> 01:23:07.582
TO COME BACK. YEAH. THAT'S A

01:23:07.649 --> 01:23:09.184
THAT'S A BIG DEBATE ACTUALLY IN

01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:11.386
OUR FIELD IS WHAT DO YOU DO IN

01:23:11.453 --> 01:23:13.121
THE INTERIM BEFORE THOSE RESULTS

01:23:13.188 --> 01:23:13.688
COME BACK. AND THAT'S VERY

01:23:13.755 --> 01:23:14.356
PHYSICIAN DEPENDENT. SOME WILL

01:23:14.422 --> 01:23:16.157
GO AHEAD AND TREAT PEOPLE

01:23:16.224 --> 01:23:16.758
EMPIRICALLY FOR VALLEY FEVER

01:23:16.825 --> 01:23:18.626
EVEN BEFORE THE TESTS ARE BACK

01:23:18.693 --> 01:23:20.195
AND SOME DON'T. AND THAT REALLY

01:23:20.261 --> 01:23:21.429
DEPENDS ON HOW SICK THE PATIENT

01:23:21.496 --> 01:23:23.365
IS AT THAT TIME. YOU KNOW, IF

01:23:23.431 --> 01:23:24.699
THEY'RE GONNA BE IN THE

01:23:24.766 --> 01:23:26.134
HOSPITAL, THEY'RE PROBABLY GOING

01:23:26.201 --> 01:23:26.735
TO BE TREATED INITIALLY. AND

01:23:26.801 --> 01:23:28.903
THEN IF WHEN THE TEST RETURNS,

01:23:28.970 --> 01:23:29.871
WE CAN TAILOR THAT ACCORDINGLY.

01:23:29.938 --> 01:23:31.272
AND THEN THIS WOULD BE IT

01:23:31.339 --> 01:23:32.273
WOULDN'T BE AUTOMATIC. IT WOULD

01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:35.043
BE BASED ON WHAT THEIR EXPOSURE

01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:35.677
MIGHT HAVE BEEN. YEAH I THINK

01:23:35.744 --> 01:23:36.945
BASED ON SYMPTOMS. SO THE CDC

01:23:37.011 --> 01:23:39.547
AND US, WE WROTE A PAPER

01:23:39.614 --> 01:23:40.081
ACTUALLY IN THE ANNALS OF

01:23:40.148 --> 01:23:41.416
INTERNAL MEDICINE THAT TOOK TO

01:23:41.483 --> 01:23:42.717
TASK A LITTLE BIT OUR NATIONAL

01:23:42.784 --> 01:23:43.318
PNEUMONIA GUIDELINES, BECAUSE

01:23:43.385 --> 01:23:44.652
THEY'RE VERY EAST COAST FOCUSED.

01:23:44.719 --> 01:23:46.354
BUT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY OF

01:23:46.421 --> 01:23:47.255
CALIFORNIA, IF YOU HAVE

01:23:47.322 --> 01:23:48.490
PNEUMONIA, THERE'S A 1 IN 4

01:23:48.556 --> 01:23:51.326
CHANCE IT'S VALLEY FEVER, AND

01:23:51.393 --> 01:23:52.727
THAT'S ACROSS THE BOARD EVERY ER

01:23:52.794 --> 01:23:54.596
URGENT CARE CLINIC. SO IF YOUR

01:23:54.662 --> 01:23:56.364
INCIDENCE IS THAT HIGH, REALLY

01:23:56.431 --> 01:23:57.732
ALL THOSE PATIENTS SHOULD BE

01:23:57.799 --> 01:23:59.267
TESTED FOR VALLEY FEVER. TO

01:23:59.334 --> 01:24:01.536
AVOID THESE 3 TO 4 MONTH DELAYS

01:24:01.603 --> 01:24:02.504
IN DIAGNOSIS. THAT'S THAT'S SO

01:24:02.570 --> 01:24:04.739
FREQUENT IN THESE PATIENTS OKAY.

01:24:04.806 --> 01:24:06.741
THANK YOU. THIS IS I'M FROM SAN

01:24:06.808 --> 01:24:08.576
DIEGO. SO VALLEY FEVER CERTAINLY

01:24:08.643 --> 01:24:11.579
HASN'T REACHED US YET IS THE

01:24:11.646 --> 01:24:13.281
OPERATIVE WORD. BUT WE DON'T SEE

01:24:13.348 --> 01:24:15.750
A LOT OF THIS IN SAN DIEGO. SO A

01:24:15.817 --> 01:24:17.419
LOT OF THIS IS NEW TO ME. WHAT

01:24:17.485 --> 01:24:19.187
IS THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM IF

01:24:19.254 --> 01:24:21.122
THIS IS GOING TO BE A NEW

01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:21.689
REQUIREMENT THAT PHYSICIANS

01:24:21.756 --> 01:24:25.493
PROVIDE? WHAT HOW DO WE ENSURE

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:26.694
THAT PATIENTS ARE GETTING THIS

01:24:26.761 --> 01:24:30.565
SCREENING? I CAN TELL YOU MY

01:24:30.632 --> 01:24:32.400
OPINION, BUT I THINK GIVING

01:24:32.467 --> 01:24:33.768
PHYSICIANS THEIR DATA AND

01:24:33.835 --> 01:24:35.303
COMPARED TO THEIR PEERS IS THE

01:24:35.370 --> 01:24:36.838
MOST EFFECTIVE THING TO DO.

01:24:36.905 --> 01:24:38.273
TYPICALLY, IT'S NOT AS HEAVY

01:24:38.339 --> 01:24:39.674
HANDED AND THERE'S A LITTLE BIT

01:24:39.741 --> 01:24:41.342
OF EMBARRASSMENT, FRANKLY, WHEN

01:24:41.409 --> 01:24:42.043
THEY SEE, OH, MY PEERS ARE

01:24:42.110 --> 01:24:44.012
TESTING THIS PERCENT WITH THIS

01:24:44.078 --> 01:24:44.579
PERCENT OF POSITIVITY, WHICH

01:24:44.646 --> 01:24:45.580
SHOWS THEY'RE PRETTY GOOD AT

01:24:45.647 --> 01:24:47.682
TELLING WHO HAS THE DISEASE. AND

01:24:47.749 --> 01:24:48.716
YOU DO LIKE TO COMPARE YOURSELF

01:24:48.783 --> 01:24:50.518
TO YOUR PEERS. I THINK THAT

01:24:50.585 --> 01:24:52.187
WOULD BE THE BEST SORT OF

01:24:52.253 --> 01:24:52.787
MEASUREMENT FOR SUCCESS WITH

01:24:52.854 --> 01:24:55.356
THIS. THANK YOU. AND THEN I'M

01:24:55.423 --> 01:24:57.592
ASSUMING THAT THE TESTING, THE

01:24:57.659 --> 01:24:59.360
SCREENING IS COVERED UNDER

01:24:59.427 --> 01:25:01.729
CURRENT HEALTH INSURANCE AND

01:25:01.796 --> 01:25:03.998
MEDI-CAL AS WELL. IS THAT

01:25:04.065 --> 01:25:06.134
CORRECT? OKAY. AND THEN WITH ALL

01:25:06.201 --> 01:25:08.970
OF THIS IN MIND, I WANT SOME

01:25:09.037 --> 01:25:10.271
ASSURANCE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO

01:25:10.338 --> 01:25:11.973
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:13.608
OPPOSITION. OUR MEDICAL

01:25:13.675 --> 01:25:15.677
PROVIDERS DO HAVE BOOTS ON THE

01:25:15.743 --> 01:25:17.712
GROUND EXPERIENCE OF WHAT THIS

01:25:17.779 --> 01:25:19.881
ALL ENTAILS, AND LOOK FORWARD TO

01:25:19.948 --> 01:25:22.584
SEEING THAT WORK COME FORWARD AS

01:25:22.650 --> 01:25:24.452
IT APPROACHES THE ASSEMBLY

01:25:24.519 --> 01:25:28.156
FLOOR. YES. YES, ABSOLUTELY. YOU

01:25:28.223 --> 01:25:29.290
HAVE MY COMMITMENT THAT I'LL

01:25:29.357 --> 01:25:30.558
CONTINUE TO WORKING WITH ANYONE

01:25:30.625 --> 01:25:32.961
THAT HAS ANY CONCERNS. I ALWAYS

01:25:33.027 --> 01:25:35.029
HAVE AN OPEN DOOR POLICY, AND I

01:25:35.096 --> 01:25:37.232
WILL SAY THAT, YOU KNOW, PART OF

01:25:37.298 --> 01:25:39.367
THE REASON WHY I BRING THIS BILL

01:25:39.434 --> 01:25:41.102
FORWARD, I HAVE A DIFFERENT BILL

01:25:41.169 --> 01:25:43.137
ALSO THAT FOCUSES MORE ON

01:25:43.204 --> 01:25:44.772
WASTEWATER TESTING. BUT PART OF

01:25:44.839 --> 01:25:47.542
IT GOES BACK TO PEOPLE IN THIS

01:25:47.609 --> 01:25:51.112
REGION THAT WHERE THERE IS HIGH

01:25:51.179 --> 01:25:53.681
INCIDENCE RATES, JUST THE

01:25:53.748 --> 01:25:56.184
INFORMATION IS NOT THERE AND THE

01:25:56.251 --> 01:25:57.986
TESTING IS NOT ADEQUATELY THERE

01:25:58.052 --> 01:26:00.555
EITHER. AND SO WE'RE JUST TRYING

01:26:00.622 --> 01:26:02.724
TO DO MORE FOR THE FOR, FOR

01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:04.592
PEOPLE IN THOSE REGIONS WITH

01:26:04.659 --> 01:26:06.995
HIGH INCIDENCE RATES AND, AND

01:26:07.061 --> 01:26:08.096
HOPING TO HAVE YOUR SUPPORT

01:26:08.162 --> 01:26:10.565
TODAY. THANK YOU. ONE FINAL

01:26:10.632 --> 01:26:13.134
QUESTION. HOW DO SYMPTOMS OF

01:26:13.201 --> 01:26:15.069
VALLEY FEVER DIFFER FROM OTHER

01:26:15.136 --> 01:26:17.438
FLU LIKE SYMPTOMS? HOW WOULD A

01:26:17.505 --> 01:26:20.275
PATIENT KNOW TO NOT JUST REST IT

01:26:20.341 --> 01:26:22.143
OFF, BUT TO INSTEAD GO SEEK

01:26:22.210 --> 01:26:23.344
MEDICAL CARE WHERE THEY CAN BE

01:26:23.411 --> 01:26:25.313
PROVIDED AN ANTIFUNGAL? YES, THE

01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:26.748
SYMPTOMS ARE ALMOST IDENTICAL

01:26:26.814 --> 01:26:27.849
FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF

01:26:27.916 --> 01:26:29.217
PATIENTS. THEY HAVE A FAIR

01:26:29.284 --> 01:26:31.119
RANGE. YOU KNOW, THEY CAN BE

01:26:31.185 --> 01:26:32.320
VERY MILD OR THEY CAN HAVE

01:26:32.387 --> 01:26:33.655
PNEUMONIA BE ADMITTED TO THE

01:26:33.721 --> 01:26:34.322
HOSPITAL FOR UNCOMPLICATED

01:26:34.389 --> 01:26:35.523
PULMONARY INFECTIONS. THERE'S A

01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:37.692
FEW THAT ARE REALLY KÃ², LIKE IF

01:26:37.759 --> 01:26:39.394
THEY HAVE NODULES OVER THEIR

01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:39.961
LEGS, THAT'S ALMOST ALWAYS

01:26:40.028 --> 01:26:40.929
VALLEY FEVER AND THE APPROPRIATE

01:26:40.995 --> 01:26:41.963
CLINICAL CIRCUMSTANCE. AND THEN

01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:43.498
THEY HAVE A PARTICULAR BLOOD

01:26:43.565 --> 01:26:45.166
CELL TYPE THAT POPS UP ON THEIR

01:26:45.233 --> 01:26:46.701
BLOOD WORK. THAT SUGGESTS IT'S

01:26:46.768 --> 01:26:47.569
VALLEY FEVER. BUT THAT'S NOT

01:26:47.635 --> 01:26:49.304
ALWAYS PRESENT. IT'S PROBABLY

01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:51.272
ONLY PRESENT IN ABOUT 5 TO 15%

01:26:51.339 --> 01:26:52.540
OF PATIENTS. SO OTHER THAN THAT

01:26:52.607 --> 01:26:53.374
THE SYMPTOMS OVERLAP. SO COVID

01:26:53.441 --> 01:26:55.743
WAS A BIG PROBLEM TO DIAGNOSE

01:26:55.810 --> 01:26:57.412
VALLEY FEVER. WE COULDN'T TELL

01:26:57.478 --> 01:26:58.046
IF THIS COVID IS THIS VALLEY

01:26:58.112 --> 01:26:59.914
FEVER. IS IT FROM THE WILDFIRE

01:26:59.981 --> 01:27:01.816
SMOKE THAT YEAR. SO THE SYMPTOMS

01:27:01.883 --> 01:27:04.118
ARE INDISTINGUISHABLE FOR MOST

01:27:04.185 --> 01:27:07.055
PATIENTS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU

01:27:07.121 --> 01:27:09.357
SENATOR I THINK VERY MUCH

01:27:09.424 --> 01:27:10.725
APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS

01:27:10.792 --> 01:27:14.329
FORWARD. AND MY SENSE IS AFTER

01:27:14.395 --> 01:27:16.898
WE'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:27:16.965 --> 01:27:18.566
CONSIDER THE WELL PUT FORWARD

01:27:18.633 --> 01:27:20.134
THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU ARE

01:27:20.201 --> 01:27:23.004
ACCEPTING THIS BILL AND THE

01:27:23.071 --> 01:27:25.540
SCREENING AND SUBSEQUENT TESTING

01:27:25.607 --> 01:27:28.409

RIGHT NOW REALLY MORE RELATE TO

01:27:42.190 --> 01:27:43.324

01:27:43.391 --> 01:27:46.494
PURVIEW OF JUDICIARY, LESS SO IN

01:27:46.561 --> 01:27:48.896

BILL. THERE WAS THIS KIND OF

01:27:57.905 --> 01:28:00.441
POTENTIALLY SUBJECTIVE POINT

01:28:00.508 --> 01:28:02.510
AROUND THE HIGH INCIDENCE OF

01:28:02.577 --> 01:28:04.278

01:28:04.345 --> 01:28:05.780

COLLEAGUES. WE'VE ALL FOR

DECADES BEEN WANTING TO JUST RE

01:30:11.172 --> 01:30:12.640
TO MODERNIZE, TO REINVENT, TO

01:30:12.707 --> 01:30:14.642
ENSURE THAT MEDI-CAL IS REALLY

REACHING EVERYBODY'S NEEDS. IT'S

01:30:17.345 --> 01:30:19.113
HOLISTIC. THE APPROACH GETS OUT,

01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:21.082
NOT JUST THE ONE CONCERN THAT

01:30:21.149 --> 01:30:23.451
PEOPLE COME TO SEE PROVIDERS

01:30:23.518 --> 01:30:24.685

01:30:24.752 --> 01:30:27.021
CONCERN. AND COUNT AIMED TO DO

01:30:27.088 --> 01:30:29.157

01:30:29.223 --> 01:30:30.458
ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT

01:30:30.525 --> 01:30:33.027
APPROACH THAT IS SORT OF A FULL

01:30:33.094 --> 01:30:34.529
SERVICE PARTNERSHIP APPROACH

01:30:34.595 --> 01:30:36.030
THAT THE INDIVIDUAL IS GETTING

01:30:36.097 --> 01:30:37.765
EVERYTHING THAT THEY NEED NOW.

01:30:37.832 --> 01:30:39.834
ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT ARE

01:30:39.901 --> 01:30:41.169
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE CONTRACTED

01:30:41.235 --> 01:30:43.137
WITH OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS TO

01:30:43.204 --> 01:30:46.040
DO THIS WORK, TO MEET THE

01:30:46.107 --> 01:30:47.175
COMMUNITY MEMBER WHERE THEY'RE

01:30:47.241 --> 01:30:48.509
AT. AND THE WHOLE INTENT WAS

01:30:48.576 --> 01:30:50.678
THAT THEY WOULD BE IN THE

01:30:50.745 --> 01:30:51.312
COMMUNITY THEMSELVES, THAT THEY

01:30:51.379 --> 01:30:52.513
WOULD LOOK LIKE THE COMMUNITY

01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:53.581
THAT WOULD BE THOSE TRUSTED,

01:30:53.648 --> 01:30:55.449
TRUSTED MESSENGERS. PERHAPS

01:30:55.516 --> 01:30:56.717
THOSE ARE THE PROMOTORAS

01:30:56.784 --> 01:30:57.952
COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS THAT

01:30:58.019 --> 01:31:00.054
PEOPLE KNOW SO WELL. HOWEVER,

01:31:00.121 --> 01:31:01.823
RECENT STUDIES AND REPORTS HAVE

01:31:01.889 --> 01:31:04.759
SHOWED THAT MORE THAN 50% OF THE

01:31:04.826 --> 01:31:05.860
CONTRACTS THAT MANAGED CARE

01:31:05.927 --> 01:31:07.628
PLANS ARE CONTRACTED WITH ARE

01:31:07.695 --> 01:31:09.831
FOR PROFIT ENTITIES, AND IT'S

01:31:09.897 --> 01:31:13.034
TRENDED UP TO 67%. AND OF THAT,

01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:16.270
APPROXIMATELY 13 OR 1515% ARE

01:31:16.337 --> 01:31:17.672
THOSE THAT ARE GETTING

01:31:17.738 --> 01:31:19.440
CONTRACTED OUT OF THE STATE. SO

01:31:19.507 --> 01:31:21.342
WHAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR COMMUNITY

01:31:21.409 --> 01:31:22.677
ARE MANAGED CARE PLANS THAT ARE

01:31:22.743 --> 01:31:24.512
CONTRACTING WITH ENTITIES IN

01:31:24.579 --> 01:31:25.746
ARIZONA AND OTHER STATES TO

01:31:25.813 --> 01:31:28.115
PROVIDE CARE IN YOUR BACKYARD. I

01:31:28.182 --> 01:31:29.417
THINK WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT.

01:31:29.483 --> 01:31:31.485
THE WHOLE INTENT, AGAIN, LIKE I

01:31:31.552 --> 01:31:32.253
MENTIONED, IS FOR OUR MANAGED

01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:33.387
CARE PLANS TO REACH OUT AND

01:31:33.454 --> 01:31:35.690
CONTRACT WITH ENTITIES THAT ARE

01:31:35.756 --> 01:31:36.524
IN PEOPLE'S BACKYARDS THAT KNOW

01:31:36.591 --> 01:31:37.825

HAVE A PHYSICAL PRESENCE THERE.

01:31:39.894 --> 01:31:42.196
SO THAT'S WHAT SB 324 IS LOOKING

01:31:42.263 --> 01:31:44.198
TO DO. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:31:44.265 --> 01:31:45.132
WE REQUIRE MEDI-CAL PLANS TO

01:31:45.199 --> 01:31:46.601

INDIVIDUALS. THE GOAL WASN'T TO

01:41:24.244 --> 01:41:25.312
EXCLUDE THEM, BUT THE GOAL WAS

01:41:25.379 --> 01:41:27.581
JUST TO ELEVATE THE LOCAL

01:41:27.648 --> 01:41:28.982

01:42:29.109 --> 01:42:31.512
ITEM FOR THE HEARING. ITEM

01:42:31.578 --> 01:42:49.363
NUMBER EIGHT SB 418.

01:42:51.798 --> 01:42:56.003
GREAT. SB 418 NOW AMENDED HAS

01:42:56.069 --> 01:42:57.504
TWO CRUCIAL PROVISIONS. IT'S

01:42:57.571 --> 01:43:00.474
LOOKING TO CONTINUE ACCESS TO

01:43:00.541 --> 01:43:02.175
ESSENTIAL HEALTH CARE IN

01:43:02.242 --> 01:43:03.210
CALIFORNIA. THE FIRST ONE, IT'S

01:43:03.277 --> 01:43:06.413
LOOKING TO CODIFY SECTION 1557

01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:08.615
OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT INTO

01:43:08.682 --> 01:43:11.485
INTO STATE LAW. AND SECTION 1557

01:43:11.552 --> 01:43:15.455
IS VERY HAS TOUCHES ON A LOT OF

01:43:15.522 --> 01:43:17.858
THINGS. AND ONE OF THE THINGS

01:43:17.925 --> 01:43:18.525
THAT IT DOES IS ENSHRINES BASIC

01:43:18.592 --> 01:43:19.393
PROTECTIONS FROM DISCRIMINATION

01:43:19.459 --> 01:43:21.194
IN ANY HEALTH PROGRAM OR

01:43:21.261 --> 01:43:22.329
ACTIVITY THAT RECEIVES

01:43:22.396 --> 01:43:23.330
GOVERNMENT FUNDING. SO WHAT DOES

01:43:23.397 --> 01:43:24.531
THAT MEAN? YOU CAN'T BE

01:43:24.598 --> 01:43:26.233
DISCRIMINATED BASED ON YOUR

01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:27.734
ETHNICITY, YOUR RACE, YOUR SEX,

01:43:27.801 --> 01:43:29.836
YOUR SEXUAL ORIENTATION, YOUR

01:43:29.903 --> 01:43:32.039
GENDER, AND SO FORTH. THE SECOND

01:43:32.105 --> 01:43:33.407
PART OF THIS PROVISION THAT WAS

01:43:33.473 --> 01:43:35.208
ADDED IN THE SECOND HOUSE HERE

01:43:35.275 --> 01:43:37.811
IS THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO DO WHAT

01:43:37.878 --> 01:43:41.415
WAS DONE YEARS AGO WITH SB 999,

01:43:41.481 --> 01:43:42.749
WHERE PEOPLE WERE WERE

01:43:42.816 --> 01:43:44.251
INDIVIDUALS WERE ALLOWED TO GET

01:43:44.318 --> 01:43:46.486
A PRESCRIPTION OF UP TO 12

01:43:46.553 --> 01:43:48.255
MONTHS FOR CONTRACEPTION. BUT IN

01:43:48.322 --> 01:43:49.590
THIS CASE, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:43:49.656 --> 01:43:52.192
THAT THAT SAME COULD APPLY FOR

01:43:52.259 --> 01:43:53.660
INDIVIDUALS WHO DEPEND ON

01:43:53.727 --> 01:43:56.463
HORMONE THERAPY. HRT IS, I'LL BE

01:43:56.530 --> 01:43:58.365
MENTIONING, MOVING FORWARD TO BE

01:43:58.432 --> 01:44:01.535
ABLE GIVEN A PROVIDER

01:44:01.602 --> 01:44:03.403
PRESCRIPTION DEEMED MEDICALLY

01:44:03.470 --> 01:44:04.771
NECESSARY, A PRESCRIPTION OF UP

01:44:04.838 --> 01:44:07.674
TO 12 MONTHS TO OBTAIN HRT AND

01:44:07.741 --> 01:44:09.276
HAVE IT BE COVERED BY HEALTH

01:44:09.343 --> 01:44:11.211
PLANS. SO WHY IS THIS NEEDED?

01:44:11.278 --> 01:44:13.580
WELL, IN THE SIX MONTHS A LOT OF

01:44:13.647 --> 01:44:14.247
EXECUTIVE ORDERS HAVE COME DOWN

01:44:14.314 --> 01:44:16.149
AND ONE OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS

01:44:16.216 --> 01:44:19.386
LOOKED TO DIRECT TO DO RESEARCH

01:44:19.453 --> 01:44:21.288
ON HOW WE CAN REMOVE OR HOW THE

01:44:21.355 --> 01:44:23.390
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN REMOVE

01:44:23.457 --> 01:44:24.925
SECTION 1557 FROM THE ACA,

01:44:24.992 --> 01:44:26.293
OBVIOUSLY, STATE, STATE OF

01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:28.161
CALIFORNIA, WE LEAD IN OUR PROUD

01:44:28.228 --> 01:44:29.997
OURSELVES IN ENSURING THAT WE

01:44:30.063 --> 01:44:31.832
ARE ALWAYS LEADING WITH

01:44:31.898 --> 01:44:32.499
ANTI-DISCRIMINATION AND

01:44:32.566 --> 01:44:33.700
EVERYTHING AND ANYTHING WE DO,

01:44:33.767 --> 01:44:35.102
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO

01:44:35.168 --> 01:44:36.236
HEALTHCARE. THAT'S A HUMAN BASIC

01:44:36.303 --> 01:44:37.504
RIGHT, AND WE SHOULDN'T

01:44:37.571 --> 01:44:38.238
DISCRIMINATE ANYONE, REGARDLESS

01:44:38.305 --> 01:44:40.474
OF ANYTHING. ADDITIONALLY, A LOT

01:44:40.540 --> 01:44:42.042
OF MISLEADING AND FALSE

01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:43.910
INFORMATION AIMED AT RESTRICTING

01:44:43.977 --> 01:44:45.746
GENDER AFFIRMING CARE HAS HAD

01:44:45.812 --> 01:44:46.847
GRAVE CONSEQUENCES IN

01:44:46.913 --> 01:44:48.749
CALIFORNIA. AND IT DOESN'T JUST

01:44:48.815 --> 01:44:50.717
IMPACT THE LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY.

01:44:50.784 --> 01:44:51.985
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT GENDER

01:44:52.052 --> 01:44:53.320
AFFIRMING CARE, WE'RE WE'RE ALSO

01:44:53.387 --> 01:44:55.589
GROUPING IN INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE

01:44:55.656 --> 01:44:57.224
ELIGIBLE TO GET TO HAVE

01:44:57.290 --> 01:44:59.526
MENOPAUSE. MAKES UP ABOUT 51% OF

01:44:59.593 --> 01:45:02.763
OUR POPULATION. HORMONE HRT IS

01:45:02.829 --> 01:45:04.765
USED FOR WOMEN WHO ARE

01:45:04.831 --> 01:45:06.400
PERIMENOPAUSAL OR ARE IN

01:45:06.466 --> 01:45:08.168
MENOPAUSE, HAS ENDLESS AMOUNT OF

01:45:08.235 --> 01:45:09.603
STUDIES THAT SHOW THE BENEFITS

01:45:09.670 --> 01:45:12.873
IN REDUCING THE IMPACTS OR THE

01:45:12.939 --> 01:45:13.940
SYMPTOMS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED

01:45:14.007 --> 01:45:14.908
WITH MENOPAUSE. BUT WHAT'S

01:45:14.975 --> 01:45:16.510
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IS THAT THE

01:45:16.576 --> 01:45:17.811
WAIT TIME, ON AVERAGE IS SIX

01:45:17.878 --> 01:45:19.513
MONTHS TO SEE A PROVIDER. PEOPLE

01:45:19.579 --> 01:45:21.081
ARE WORRIED THAT THEY'RE GOING

01:45:21.148 --> 01:45:22.516
TO GET THEIR PRESCRIPTIONS HAVE

01:45:22.582 --> 01:45:23.483
BE CUT OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF

01:45:23.550 --> 01:45:25.719
THEIR TREATMENT. AND WHEN IT

01:45:25.786 --> 01:45:27.187
COMES TO LGBTQ PLUS INDIVIDUALS,

01:45:27.254 --> 01:45:28.088
PREDOMINANTLY TRANS INDIVIDUALS,

01:45:28.155 --> 01:45:30.590
YOU HAVE TO BE ON HRT FOR TWO

01:45:30.657 --> 01:45:32.259
YEARS BEFORE YOU'RE ELIGIBLE FOR

01:45:32.325 --> 01:45:33.593
GENDER AFFIRMING CARE. IF YOU'RE

01:45:33.660 --> 01:45:35.429
CUT OFF THAT TIME, THAT CLOCK

01:45:35.495 --> 01:45:37.564
STARTS ALL OVER AGAIN. SO IT'S

01:45:37.631 --> 01:45:40.167
IMPERATIVE THAT WE LEAD WITH

01:45:40.233 --> 01:45:41.968
SOMETHING THAT IS NOT

01:45:42.035 --> 01:45:43.470
UNPRECEDENT. IT'S BEEN DONE

01:45:43.537 --> 01:45:45.172
ALREADY BEFORE, ENSURING THAT WE

01:45:45.238 --> 01:45:48.375
BRING SOME RELIEF TO INDIVIDUALS

01:45:48.442 --> 01:45:50.377
WHO DEPEND ON THIS. AND WE

01:45:50.444 --> 01:45:51.812
WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST STATE. THE

01:45:51.878 --> 01:45:52.779
STATE OF WASHINGTON HAS ALREADY

01:45:52.846 --> 01:45:54.181
PUSHED FORWARD LEGISLATION THAT

01:45:54.247 --> 01:45:56.216
WOULD ALLOW UP TO 12 MONTHS OF

01:45:56.283 --> 01:45:58.618
HRT FOR INDIVIDUALS. AND AGAIN,

01:45:58.685 --> 01:46:01.154
THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS THAT, YES,

01:46:01.221 --> 01:46:03.156
ARE TRANS, BUT ALSO PEOPLE WHO

01:46:03.223 --> 01:46:04.958
ARE UNDERGOING CANCER TREATMENT.

01:46:05.025 --> 01:46:07.427
AND LIKE I MENTIONED, MENOPAUSE,

01:46:07.494 --> 01:46:08.829
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE HORMONE

01:46:08.895 --> 01:46:10.230
DEFICIENCY NEEDING TREATMENT FOR

01:46:10.297 --> 01:46:13.667
CONDITIONS LIKE HYPOTHYROID ISM,

01:46:13.734 --> 01:46:15.469
PEOPLE ARE STOCKPILING HORMONES,

01:46:15.535 --> 01:46:16.903
THE RATIONING THEIR HORMONES,

01:46:16.970 --> 01:46:18.271
AND THEY'RE SEEKING CARE IN AN

01:46:18.338 --> 01:46:19.439
UNREGULATED MARKET. THIS BILL

01:46:19.506 --> 01:46:22.809
WILL HELP TO FIRST TO ONE,

01:46:22.876 --> 01:46:24.144
ENSHRINE ANTI-DISCRIMINATION IN

01:46:24.211 --> 01:46:26.413
OUR STATUTE AND ALLOW FOR THE 12

01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:28.915
MONTH PRESCRIPTION. MADAM CHAIR,

01:46:28.982 --> 01:46:30.283
I'D NOW LIKE TO TURN OVER TO

01:46:30.350 --> 01:46:31.585
WITNESSES WHO WOULD SPEAK IN

01:46:31.651 --> 01:46:34.688
SUPPORT OF THIS. THANK YOU. EACH

01:46:34.755 --> 01:46:38.925
HAVE TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU.

01:46:38.992 --> 01:46:40.694
THANK YOU, AND GOOD AFTERNOON.

01:46:40.761 --> 01:46:42.095
MY NAME IS CHRISTINE SMITH. I'M

01:46:42.162 --> 01:46:43.930
A LESBIAN, CISGENDER WOMAN AND

01:46:43.997 --> 01:46:46.066
AN IVF PATIENT. I'M ALSO A

01:46:46.133 --> 01:46:47.601
POLICY AND LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE

01:46:47.667 --> 01:46:49.336
AT HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA WHO

01:46:49.402 --> 01:46:51.638
DOES SUPPORT THIS BILL. I'M

01:46:51.705 --> 01:46:53.573
PROUD TO BE HERE TO SUPPORT SB

01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:55.709
418. IVF IN GENERAL AND

01:46:55.776 --> 01:46:57.310
SPECIFICALLY HORMONAL

01:46:57.377 --> 01:46:58.512
MEDICATIONS HAVE FACED FEDERAL

01:46:58.578 --> 01:47:00.614
THREATS. BUT THESE THREATS TO

01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:01.581
TRANSGENDER PEOPLE HAVE THE

01:47:01.648 --> 01:47:03.283
CAPACITY TO ALSO THREATEN

01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:04.751
CISGENDER PEOPLE, INCLUDING

01:47:04.818 --> 01:47:07.487
PEOPLE UNDERGOING IVF. I STARTED

01:47:07.554 --> 01:47:10.891
MY FERTILITY JOURNEY IN 2021. AS

01:47:10.957 --> 01:47:12.392
ANYONE UNDERGOING FERTILITY

01:47:12.459 --> 01:47:14.127
SERVICES CAN ATTEST, THIS

01:47:14.194 --> 01:47:16.663
PROCESS IS HARD FINANCIALLY,

01:47:16.730 --> 01:47:18.732
EMOTIONALLY AND PHYSICALLY. I AM

01:47:18.799 --> 01:47:20.267
THANKFUL TO HAVE HAD ACCESS TO

01:47:20.333 --> 01:47:22.335
BOTH FERTILITY SERVICES AND

01:47:22.402 --> 01:47:25.005
MEDICATIONS, INCLUDING ESTROGEN.

01:47:25.071 --> 01:47:27.541
IN JUNE OF 2022, I HAD MY FIRST

01:47:27.607 --> 01:47:29.543
IVF TRANSFER, WHICH RESULTED IN

01:47:29.609 --> 01:47:32.112
AN EARLY MISCARRIAGE. FURTHER

01:47:32.179 --> 01:47:33.814
TESTING SHOWED ENDOMETRIOSIS, SO

01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:35.115
I WAS PLACED IN A CHEMICALLY

01:47:35.182 --> 01:47:37.250
INDUCED MENOPAUSE FOR TWO MONTHS

01:47:37.317 --> 01:47:39.419
TO LIMIT MY BODY'S PRODUCTION OF

01:47:39.486 --> 01:47:42.155
ESTROGEN. IN JANUARY 2023, PRIOR

01:47:42.222 --> 01:47:44.524
TO MY NEXT IVF TRANSFER, I

01:47:44.591 --> 01:47:45.792
STARTED TWICE A WEEK

01:47:45.859 --> 01:47:47.227
INTRAMUSCULAR ESTROGEN SHOTS

01:47:47.294 --> 01:47:49.529
ALONG WITH DAILY PROGESTERONE

01:47:49.596 --> 01:47:51.031
SHOTS, AS WELL AS A COMBINED

01:47:51.097 --> 01:47:52.999
PROGESTERONE AND ESTROGEN DAILY

01:47:53.066 --> 01:47:54.501
MEDICATION. THANKFULLY, THE

OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AND

01:48:50.991 --> 01:48:52.392
NATIONWIDE. THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE

01:48:52.459 --> 01:48:54.194
FACING OUR FAMILIES ARE THAT

01:48:54.261 --> 01:48:55.562
THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE

01:48:55.629 --> 01:48:56.796
ROLLBACK OF HEALTHCARE OPTIONS

01:48:56.863 --> 01:48:58.431
BY THE CURRENT FEDERAL

01:48:58.498 --> 01:48:59.599
ADMINISTRATION, BETWEEN THE

01:48:59.666 --> 01:49:00.934
FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION PUSHING

01:49:01.001 --> 01:49:02.535
POLICIES THAT TARGET TRANSGENDER

01:49:02.602 --> 01:49:04.704
PEOPLE OF ALL AGES OR THE

01:49:04.771 --> 01:49:05.705
PULLBACK BY PROVIDERS, AND

01:49:05.772 --> 01:49:07.173
PROVIDING NECESSARY HEALTH CARE,

01:49:07.240 --> 01:49:08.508
OR THOSE PROVIDERS LIMITING

01:49:08.575 --> 01:49:10.277
ACCESS TO THAT HEALTHCARE, OUR

01:49:10.343 --> 01:49:11.778
FAMILIES ARE EXTREMELY CONCERNED

01:49:11.845 --> 01:49:13.580
ABOUT HOW THEY WILL ENSURE THAT

01:49:13.647 --> 01:49:15.081
THEY HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE

01:49:15.148 --> 01:49:17.317
FOR THEIR FAMILIES. MANY THINK

01:49:17.384 --> 01:49:19.219
ABOUT TRYING TO, AS THE SENATOR

01:49:19.286 --> 01:49:21.521
TALKED ABOUT, STOCKPILE THESE

01:49:21.588 --> 01:49:23.456
MEDICATIONS IN ORDER TO ENSURE

01:49:23.523 --> 01:49:24.891
THAT THEY HAVE TIMELY ACCESS TO

01:49:24.958 --> 01:49:28.428
IT. THIS TIES INTO THE ALSO THE

01:49:28.495 --> 01:49:30.897
FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION MAKING

01:49:30.964 --> 01:49:32.265
DECISIONS THAT GET CHALLENGED IN

01:49:32.332 --> 01:49:34.768
COURTS, WHICH AGAIN, THEN

01:49:34.834 --> 01:49:36.236
CREATES SOME UNCERTAINTY AROUND

01:49:36.303 --> 01:49:38.305
THOSE FAMILIES BEING ABLE TO

01:49:38.371 --> 01:49:39.272
ACCESS THESE NECESSARY

01:49:39.339 --> 01:49:42.475
MEDICATIONS. GREAT EXAMPLE IS

01:49:42.542 --> 01:49:43.977
THAT COURT PROCESS. OUR FAMILIES

01:49:44.044 --> 01:49:45.345
ARE WORRIED ABOUT BEING CAUGHT

01:49:45.412 --> 01:49:46.413
IN LIMBO. WHILE THE FEDERAL

01:49:46.479 --> 01:49:47.514
ADMINISTRATION TAKES ACTIONS

01:49:47.580 --> 01:49:50.050
RELATED TO PATIENT RIGHTS, WHICH

01:49:50.116 --> 01:49:51.017
NECESSITATES THE INVOLVEMENT OF

01:49:51.084 --> 01:49:53.653
THE COURTS HAVING MORE THAN ONE

01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:57.157
MONTH SUPPLY OF NECESSARY

01:49:57.223 --> 01:49:58.992
MEDICATIONS IS VERY CRITICAL FOR

01:49:59.059 --> 01:50:01.194
THAT. SAME WITH IF YOU HAPPEN TO

01:50:01.261 --> 01:50:03.530
BE A FAMILY GOING TO ONE OF THE

01:50:03.596 --> 01:50:04.531
PROVIDERS THAT HAVE PULLED BACK,

01:50:04.597 --> 01:50:06.499
THAT SCRAMBLE TO TRY AND FIND A

01:50:06.566 --> 01:50:07.867
NEW SYSTEM THAT WILL PROVIDE

01:50:07.934 --> 01:50:09.469
THAT HEALTHCARE OR DOCTORS

01:50:09.536 --> 01:50:11.371
AGAIN, HAVING THAT MORE THAN 1

01:50:11.438 --> 01:50:13.873
OR 2 MONTHS WORTH OF SUPPLY IS

01:50:13.940 --> 01:50:16.643
VERY CRITICAL. SO IN SHORT, SB

01:50:16.710 --> 01:50:18.078

01:50:18.144 --> 01:50:19.346
ACCESS TO NECESSARY HEALTHCARE

01:50:19.412 --> 01:50:21.982
HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SB 14 ALSO

01:50:22.048 --> 01:50:23.883
ALLOWS FOR A LONGER SUPPLY OF

01:50:23.950 --> 01:50:24.918
NECESSARY MEDICINE, BUT NOTHING

01:50:24.985 --> 01:50:27.754

WHAT'S NECESSARY IN THAT

01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:34.995
PROCESS. IT JUST PROVIDES THAT

01:50:35.061 --> 01:50:36.629
OPTION FOR BEING ABLE TO HAVE A

01:50:36.696 --> 01:50:37.864

01:55:52.512 --> 01:55:54.681
BETWEEN STATE AND FEDERAL LAW

01:55:54.747 --> 01:55:56.115
THAT WILL END UP DEVASTATING

01:55:56.182 --> 01:55:58.284

01:56:34.687 --> 01:56:37.156

INTERVENTIONS SHIMMERS AWAY LIKE

01:56:50.703 --> 01:56:52.905
A MIRAGE. KAISER HAS ALREADY

FORCE INSURERS AND PROVIDERS TO

LEAVE CALIFORNIA ENTIRELY. SB

01:57:13.993 --> 01:57:15.561

MEDICARE COVERAGE AT RISK BY

AFFORD THE ECONOMIC CHAOS THAT

01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:36.916
SB 418 WILL CREATE. VOTE NO. TO

THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK THE

01:58:32.939 --> 01:58:34.841
AUTHOR AND HAPPY TO MOVE THE

01:58:34.907 --> 01:58:38.911
BILL AS WELL. BUT HAVING A BILL

01:58:38.978 --> 01:58:40.680
THAT IS AROUND TRANSGENDER

01:58:40.746 --> 01:58:41.914
WELLNESS, I JUST WANT TO

01:58:41.981 --> 01:58:42.982
ACKNOWLEDGE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS

01:58:43.049 --> 01:58:45.685
THAT THESE THERAPIES HAVE

01:58:45.751 --> 01:58:47.620
CONSISTENCY. ONE OF THE THINGS

01:58:47.687 --> 01:58:50.456
THAT I HEAR MOST FROM FOLKS,

01:58:50.523 --> 01:58:52.992
PARTICULARLY RIGHT NOW, IS THAT

01:58:53.059 --> 01:58:54.427
FEAR THAT THEIR MEDICAL, THAT

01:58:54.494 --> 01:58:56.362
THEIR MEDICAL, THEIR MEDICAL

01:58:56.429 --> 01:58:59.866
CARE IS GOING TO BE CUT OFF

01:58:59.932 --> 01:59:01.200
MIDSTREAM AND THE DETRIMENTAL

01:59:01.267 --> 01:59:04.003
HEALTH EFFECTS, PARTICULARLY FOR

01:59:04.070 --> 01:59:06.572
FOLKS THAT HAVE HORMONE

01:59:06.639 --> 01:59:08.808
REPLACEMENT THERAPY AND HOW

01:59:08.875 --> 01:59:10.109
DIFFICULT THAT IS FOR THEM. AND

01:59:10.176 --> 01:59:13.346
THAT THAT IN TURN CAN CAUSE

01:59:13.412 --> 01:59:14.881
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. A LOT OF

01:59:14.947 --> 01:59:17.416
FEAR, A LOT OF ANXIETY AROUND

01:59:17.483 --> 01:59:19.185
WHAT'S GOING ON AND THAT THESE

01:59:19.252 --> 01:59:21.721
CONSTANT ATTACKS ON PERSONHOOD

01:59:21.787 --> 01:59:23.389
ARE REALLY WHAT IS CAUSING A LOT

01:59:23.456 --> 01:59:26.526
OF THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT

01:59:26.592 --> 01:59:28.160
MANY PEOPLE IN THE TRANSGENDER

01:59:28.227 --> 01:59:29.962
COMMUNITY ARE EXPERIENCING. SO I

01:59:30.029 --> 01:59:32.064
WANT TO THANK YOU. IN ADDITION

01:59:32.131 --> 01:59:34.233
TO THE IMPORTANCE IN YOUR STORY

01:59:34.300 --> 01:59:36.435
AROUND IVF IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT

01:59:36.502 --> 01:59:39.038
STORY AS WELL AND AN IMPORTANT

01:59:39.105 --> 01:59:40.540
EXPERIENCE, AND WE HAVE TO

01:59:40.606 --> 01:59:41.774
CONTINUE THAT COVERAGE. BUT I

01:59:41.841 --> 01:59:44.043
JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR

01:59:44.110 --> 01:59:45.278
FOR YOUR THOUGHTFULNESS ON THIS

01:59:45.344 --> 01:59:47.914
AND APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'VE DONE

01:59:47.980 --> 01:59:49.549
HERE AND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

01:59:49.615 --> 01:59:56.756
DO HERE. WE HAVE A MOTION BY

01:59:56.822 --> 01:59:59.792
ADUS, SECONDED BY RODRIGUEZ.

01:59:59.859 --> 02:00:01.294
SENATOR, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR

02:00:01.360 --> 02:00:04.096
BRINGING FORWARD THIS BILL. I

02:00:04.163 --> 02:00:08.534
CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND, OR THE

02:00:08.601 --> 02:00:13.839
OPPOSITIONS. POSITION. I

02:00:13.906 --> 02:00:16.075
CERTAINLY DON'T AGREE WITH IT

02:00:16.142 --> 02:00:17.410
MYSELF. I'VE ASKED TO BE A

02:00:17.476 --> 02:00:19.412
COAUTHOR ON THIS BILL. I HOPE

02:00:19.478 --> 02:00:21.847
THAT YOU WILL ACCEPT THAT. I

02:00:21.914 --> 02:00:24.717
WANT TO APPRECIATE THAT YOU HAVE

02:00:24.784 --> 02:00:26.819
REALLY PUT FORWARD A PIECE OF

02:00:26.886 --> 02:00:28.220
LEGISLATION THAT IS NEEDED, AS

02:00:28.287 --> 02:00:30.423
SO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE CURRENTLY

02:00:30.489 --> 02:00:32.992
ON HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY

02:00:33.059 --> 02:00:34.393
ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER

02:00:34.460 --> 02:00:35.628
OR NOT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO

02:00:35.695 --> 02:00:38.130
CONTINUE THEIR THEIR HEALTH CARE

02:00:38.197 --> 02:00:39.832
IN THE WAY THAT THEY NEED TO. I

02:00:39.899 --> 02:00:42.068
THINK WE'VE HEARD FROM MANY

02:00:42.134 --> 02:00:44.070
CONSTITUENTS AND PEOPLE IN THIS

02:00:44.136 --> 02:00:46.339
HEALTH COMMITTEE ABOUT THE FACT

02:00:46.405 --> 02:00:48.574
THAT HRT NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING

02:00:48.641 --> 02:00:50.910
THAT IS CONTINUOUS AND

02:00:50.977 --> 02:00:52.078
INCREDIBLY DETRIMENTAL IF IT'S

02:00:52.144 --> 02:00:54.981
NOT ABLE TO BE CONTINUOUS. AND

02:00:55.047 --> 02:00:57.583
GIVEN THE KIND OF ENVIRONMENT

02:00:57.650 --> 02:00:59.285
THAT WE ARE IN, I THINK IT'S

02:00:59.352 --> 02:01:00.319
VERY IMPORTANT, AS ASSEMBLY

02:01:00.386 --> 02:01:02.254
MEMBER ATTIS EXPRESSED, TO

02:01:02.321 --> 02:01:03.823
ENSURE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THAT

02:01:03.889 --> 02:01:05.791
HEALTH CARE FOR PEOPLE. AND I

02:01:05.858 --> 02:01:07.159
WANT TO JUST ECHO THE COMMENTS

02:01:07.226 --> 02:01:09.729
MADE BY THE WITNESS AROUND

02:01:09.795 --> 02:01:11.864
ENSURING THAT WE ARE STRUCTURING

02:01:11.931 --> 02:01:13.332
THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION IN A

02:01:13.399 --> 02:01:15.234
WAY THAT WILL ENSURE THAT HEALTH

02:01:15.301 --> 02:01:15.901
CARE PROVIDERS WILL STILL BE

02:01:15.968 --> 02:01:18.404
ABLE TO BE IN COMMUNICATION AND

02:01:18.471 --> 02:01:21.674
UNDER AND UNDER THE SUPERVISION

02:01:21.741 --> 02:01:23.676
OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON

02:01:23.743 --> 02:01:25.277
HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY. AND

02:01:25.344 --> 02:01:27.480
I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR

02:01:27.546 --> 02:01:28.047
CONTINUING CONTINUING YOUR

02:01:28.114 --> 02:01:29.649
LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA WITH

02:01:29.715 --> 02:01:31.917
THAT. SENATOR, WOULD YOU LIKE TO

02:01:31.984 --> 02:01:34.153
CLOSE? THANK YOU. I FEEL LIKE I

02:01:34.220 --> 02:01:36.122
NEED TO LEAD WITH I'M A LESBIAN.

02:01:36.188 --> 02:01:40.359
I KEPT HEARING THAT, BUT WENT

02:01:40.426 --> 02:01:43.829
OVER SOMEONE'S HEAD. NO, I THINK

02:01:43.896 --> 02:01:44.797
IT'S I THINK IT'S SUPER

02:01:44.864 --> 02:01:46.232
IMPORTANT. I THINK, YOU KNOW,

02:01:46.298 --> 02:01:48.200
WHAT WE WHAT WE DO HERE IN THIS

02:01:48.267 --> 02:01:50.569
BODY IS WE ALWAYS PUT POLICY IN

02:01:50.636 --> 02:01:51.537
FRONT OF US THAT IS DATA DRIVEN,

02:01:51.604 --> 02:01:53.973
THAT HAS EMPIRICAL RESEARCH

02:01:54.040 --> 02:01:55.241
BEHIND IT, PROVING WHAT WORKS

02:01:55.307 --> 02:01:56.942
AND WHAT DOESN'T WORK. THERE'S

02:01:57.009 --> 02:01:58.744
ENDLESS AMOUNT OF STUDIES THAT

02:01:58.811 --> 02:02:01.247
SHOW THAT WHEN WE DO INVEST IN

02:02:01.313 --> 02:02:02.782
PREVENTATIVE MEASURES, WHEN WE

02:02:02.848 --> 02:02:04.517
INVEST IN THINGS THAT ARE

02:02:04.583 --> 02:02:06.986
HOLISTIC AND TO THE NEEDS OF THE

02:02:07.053 --> 02:02:09.188
INDIVIDUAL, WE ARE UPLIFTING

02:02:09.255 --> 02:02:10.456
THEIR LIVES. WE'RE MAKING THEIR

02:02:10.523 --> 02:02:11.557
LIVES BETTER. THERE ARE STUDIES

02:02:11.624 --> 02:02:13.259
AFTER STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT

02:02:13.325 --> 02:02:15.895
LACK OF ACCESS TO CERTAIN THINGS

02:02:15.961 --> 02:02:17.596
CAN IMPACT SOMEONE'S MENTAL

02:02:17.663 --> 02:02:19.732
HEALTH, CAN LEAD TO SOMEONE

02:02:19.799 --> 02:02:21.934
TAKING THEIR OWN LIFE, CAN LEAD

02:02:22.001 --> 02:02:23.402
TO SOMEONE THINKING THAT THEY'RE

02:02:23.469 --> 02:02:25.237
NOT AS IMPORTANT AS SOMEONE ELSE

02:02:25.304 --> 02:02:28.007
AS BEFORE. 18 DOES NOT MANDATE

02:02:28.074 --> 02:02:29.809
COVERAGE FOR A PROCEDURE. DOES

02:02:29.875 --> 02:02:32.411
NOT MANDATE COVERAGE FOR X, Y,

02:02:32.478 --> 02:02:34.480
AND Z. THERE'S NO COVERAGE

02:02:34.547 --> 02:02:36.348
MANDATES OF PROCEDURES OR

02:02:36.415 --> 02:02:38.617
SURGERIES IN SB 14. IT JUST SAYS

02:02:38.684 --> 02:02:40.086
THAT IF YOU'RE OFFERING

02:02:40.152 --> 02:02:42.388
SOMETHING TO SALLY, YOU SHOULD

02:02:42.455 --> 02:02:44.190
ALSO OFFER IT TO MARTHA. IF

02:02:44.256 --> 02:02:45.991
YOU'RE OFFERING IT TO BILLY,

02:02:46.058 --> 02:02:48.260
THEN PEDRO SHOULD GET IT TOO. WE

02:02:48.327 --> 02:02:49.628
JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:02:49.695 --> 02:02:50.963
WE'RE NOT DISCRIMINATING IN WHAT

02:02:51.030 --> 02:02:53.432
IS OFFERED. ADDITIONALLY, THERE

02:02:53.499 --> 02:02:55.034
ARE RELIGIOUS EXEMPTIONS LIKE

02:02:55.101 --> 02:02:57.236
THEY EXIST NOW IN THE STATE OF

02:02:57.303 --> 02:02:58.437
CALIFORNIA THAT ALSO APPLY TO SB

02:02:58.504 --> 02:03:00.072
418. AS LONG AS THE EMPLOYER IS

02:03:00.139 --> 02:03:01.340
NOT OFFERING SOMETHING, THEY

02:03:01.407 --> 02:03:03.342
JUST THEY DON'T HAVE TO OFFER

02:03:03.409 --> 02:03:04.110
IT. BUT IF THEY START OFFERING

02:03:04.176 --> 02:03:05.644
IT TO ONE DEMOGRAPHIC, THEY'RE

02:03:05.711 --> 02:03:07.346
GOING TO HAVE TO OFFER IT TO

02:03:07.413 --> 02:03:08.114
EVERYONE. THEY CAN'T

02:03:08.180 --> 02:03:09.482
DISCRIMINATE BASED ON THE LIST

02:03:09.548 --> 02:03:10.149
THAT I'VE SAID BEFORE. AGAIN, A

CANNOT TAKE ANY AMENDMENTS IN

02:04:48.948 --> 02:04:50.249
THIS COMMITTEE, BUT THESE ARE

02:04:50.316 --> 02:04:52.184
THE THINGS THAT I HAVE COMMITTED

02:04:52.251 --> 02:04:53.352
TO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE CHAIR

02:04:53.419 --> 02:04:55.454

02:04:57.623 --> 02:04:58.490
TECHNICAL ISSUES, AND WE'LL BE

02:04:58.557 --> 02:04:59.992
ENSURING THAT THERE IS A PUBLIC

02:05:00.059 --> 02:05:01.794
COMMENT BEFORE NEW POLICIES AND

02:05:01.861 --> 02:05:03.295
PROCEDURES ARE ADOPTED. WE WILL

02:05:03.362 --> 02:05:05.064
ALSO BE REQUIRING AN APPEALS

02:05:05.130 --> 02:05:07.199
PROCESS AS PART OF ANY OVERSIGHT

02:05:07.266 --> 02:05:08.601
THAT WILL BE DEVELOPED BY HCCI

02:05:08.667 --> 02:05:10.302
THROUGH REGULATIONS AND APPROVED

02:05:10.369 --> 02:05:13.572
BY THE BOARD. SO WHAT IS SB 660

02:05:13.639 --> 02:05:15.307
DO? WELL, FOR MANY YEARS I

02:05:15.374 --> 02:05:17.843
ALWAYS QUESTIONED WHY IS IT SO

02:05:17.910 --> 02:05:19.712
DIFFICULT FOR ENTITIES TO KNOW

02:05:19.778 --> 02:05:20.479
WHAT IS HAPPENING AT ANOTHER

02:05:20.546 --> 02:05:22.615
HOSPITAL? WHY IS IT THAT WHEN I

02:05:22.681 --> 02:05:24.049
GO INTO A PROVIDER, EVEN THOUGH

02:05:24.116 --> 02:05:24.617
I VISITED SOMEONE ELSE, WHY

02:05:24.683 --> 02:05:26.018
CAN'T THOSE RECORDS BE SHARED

02:05:26.085 --> 02:05:27.486
HERE? WHY DO I HAVE TO GO

02:05:27.553 --> 02:05:29.355
THROUGH THE WHOLE LET ME TELL

02:05:29.421 --> 02:05:32.224
YOU MY STORY AND SHARE THIS, ALL

02:05:32.291 --> 02:05:32.825
THIS INFORMATION? WELL, IT'S

02:05:32.892 --> 02:05:35.294
BECAUSE BEFORE IT WAS ENTITIES,

02:05:35.361 --> 02:05:36.295
PROVIDERS, SIGNATORIES DIDN'T

02:05:36.362 --> 02:05:39.164
HAVE TO SHARE DATA. AND WE ALL

02:05:39.231 --> 02:05:41.300
KNOW THAT THE MORE WE SHARE

02:05:41.367 --> 02:05:42.868
INFORMATION, THE BETTER ACCESS.

02:05:42.935 --> 02:05:44.203
I MEAN, THE BETTER SERVICE WE

02:05:44.270 --> 02:05:46.372
CAN PROVIDE TO AN INDIVIDUAL. SO

02:05:46.438 --> 02:05:48.107
WHILE THE DATA EXCHANGE

02:05:48.173 --> 02:05:50.709
FRAMEWORK ALREADY HAS EXISTED IN

02:05:50.776 --> 02:05:52.511
PAST OF THE INTENT THAT WE

02:05:52.578 --> 02:05:55.381
SHOULD HAVE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS

02:05:55.447 --> 02:05:56.916
SHARE HEALTH DATA WITH EACH

02:05:56.982 --> 02:05:58.951
OTHER AND TO SOME EXTENT, SOME

02:05:59.018 --> 02:06:00.486
SOCIAL SERVICE DATA, WHAT WE

02:06:00.552 --> 02:06:02.388
DON'T HAVE RIGHT NOW IS A BODY

02:06:02.454 --> 02:06:03.822
THAT'S GOING TO CREATE THE

02:06:03.889 --> 02:06:05.024
PROCEDURES, THE POLICIES OF HOW

02:06:05.090 --> 02:06:06.892
THIS DATA IS GOING TO BE SHARED

02:06:06.959 --> 02:06:08.827
WITH EVERYBODY WHO'S GOING TO

02:06:08.894 --> 02:06:10.829
COME TOGETHER AND SAY, THIS IS A

02:06:10.896 --> 02:06:12.331
VIOLATION, WHO'S GOING TO COME

02:06:12.398 --> 02:06:13.265
TOGETHER AND SAY, HEY, WE'VE

02:06:13.332 --> 02:06:15.501
PASSED THIS ALREADY, AND A LOT

02:06:15.567 --> 02:06:16.635
OF ENTITIES SHOULD HAVE ALREADY

02:06:16.702 --> 02:06:19.505
STARTED SHARING DATA AS OF

02:06:19.571 --> 02:06:20.839
JANUARY 2024. BUT WHY HAVEN'T

02:06:20.906 --> 02:06:22.675
YOU DONE IT YET? AND WHAT THIS

02:06:22.741 --> 02:06:24.910
SB 660 IS LOOKING TO DO IS

02:06:24.977 --> 02:06:27.446
CREATE THAT BODY, AND WE WANT TO

02:06:27.513 --> 02:06:29.581
CREATE A BODY THAT HAS EXPERTS

02:06:29.648 --> 02:06:32.551
AT THE TABLE, FROM CONSUMER

02:06:32.618 --> 02:06:35.054
ADVOCATES TO SOMEONE FROM OUR

02:06:35.120 --> 02:06:38.524
THE SECRETARY OF HHS TO THOSE

02:06:38.590 --> 02:06:40.125
OTHER APPOINTEES FROM THE

02:06:40.192 --> 02:06:42.161
GOVERNOR, YOUR BODY AND MY BODY.

02:06:42.227 --> 02:06:44.163
NOW CREATING A BODY OF GOVERNING

02:06:44.229 --> 02:06:46.632
BODY HAS BEEN A BIT DIFFICULT.

02:06:46.699 --> 02:06:47.700
YOU KNOW, EVERYONE WANTS A PIECE

02:06:47.766 --> 02:06:50.169
OF THE PIE. I WANT TO BE AT THAT

02:06:50.235 --> 02:06:52.137
TABLE. I DON'T WANT THAT PERSON

02:06:52.204 --> 02:06:53.706
AT THE TABLE. THAT PERSON SHOULD

02:06:53.772 --> 02:06:55.407
BE AT THE TABLE, BUT SHOULD HAVE

02:06:55.474 --> 02:06:57.309
LIMITED ACCESS TO HOW THEY VOTE.

02:06:57.376 --> 02:06:57.977
IT HAS BEEN VERY DIFFICULT. I'M

02:06:58.043 --> 02:06:59.545
NOT GOING TO SAY WE'VE LANDED

02:06:59.611 --> 02:07:01.580
THE PLANE YET BECAUSE WE'VE

02:07:01.647 --> 02:07:02.982
AMENDED, WE'VE DECREASED, WE'VE

02:07:03.048 --> 02:07:04.183
ADDED, AND WE'RE STILL TRYING TO

02:07:04.249 --> 02:07:05.684
FIND THAT SWEET SPOT OF WHO

02:07:05.751 --> 02:07:08.120
SHOULD BE AT THE TABLE. BUT THIS

02:07:08.187 --> 02:07:09.922
IS WHAT I'VE MY INTENT HERE IS

02:07:09.989 --> 02:07:11.256
WHO SHOULD BE AT THE TABLE,

02:07:11.323 --> 02:07:13.092
SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO SHARE

02:07:13.158 --> 02:07:16.328
THEIR CONCERNS. IF WE'RE ASKING

02:07:16.395 --> 02:07:18.530
SIGNATORIES, HOSPITALS, CLINICS,

02:07:18.597 --> 02:07:20.833
SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES TO

02:07:20.899 --> 02:07:22.501
SHARE DATA, WE WANT THEM AT THE

02:07:22.568 --> 02:07:24.570
TABLE TO LET US KNOW WHAT'S

02:07:24.636 --> 02:07:26.271
GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL. WE DON'T

02:07:26.338 --> 02:07:27.573
WANT PEOPLE AT THE TABLE TO HAVE

02:07:27.639 --> 02:07:29.308
NO EXPERIENCE IN THOSE ENTITIES

02:07:29.375 --> 02:07:30.843
TO COME UP WITH RULES THAT

02:07:30.909 --> 02:07:32.077
PERHAPS AREN'T GOING TO BE

02:07:32.144 --> 02:07:33.979
APPLICABLE OR AREN'T GOING TO BE

02:07:34.046 --> 02:07:35.080
FEASIBLE FOR A SIGNATORY. SO WE

02:07:35.147 --> 02:07:36.982
WANT THEM AT THE TABLE. WE WANT

02:07:37.049 --> 02:07:39.451
THEIR EXPERTISE. THIS DATA

02:07:39.518 --> 02:07:40.719
EXCHANGE ACROSS THE HEALTH

02:07:40.786 --> 02:07:41.954
SECTOR WILL ELIMINATE REDUNDANT

02:07:42.021 --> 02:07:43.655
AND COSTLY TEST APPOINTMENTS.

02:07:43.722 --> 02:07:46.058
IT'S GOING TO AVOID UNNECESSARY

02:07:46.125 --> 02:07:46.959
HOSPITALIZATIONS, READMISSIONS,

02:07:47.026 --> 02:07:48.260
DELIVER MORE EFFECTIVE,

02:07:48.327 --> 02:07:49.461
COORDINATED CARE ACROSS

02:07:49.528 --> 02:07:51.363
SETTINGS. NOW, YOU'VE PROBABLY

02:07:51.430 --> 02:07:53.065
HEARD THE CONCERNS OF LIKE WHAT

02:07:53.132 --> 02:07:54.600
ABOUT SMALLER ENTITIES? WHAT

02:07:54.666 --> 02:07:55.968
ABOUT THE SNFS? THEY DON'T HAVE

02:07:56.035 --> 02:07:57.870
THE ABILITY TO DO THIS CURRENT

02:07:57.936 --> 02:07:59.671
LAW IN PROCEDURES. THE DATA

02:07:59.738 --> 02:08:01.407
EXCHANGE FRAMEWORK ALREADY SAYS

02:08:01.473 --> 02:08:04.009
THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE

02:08:04.076 --> 02:08:05.811
MECHANISM TO PROVIDE ELECTRONIC

02:08:05.878 --> 02:08:07.146
RECORDS, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO

02:08:07.212 --> 02:08:09.048
THIS. THAT'S ALREADY IN, IN, IN

02:08:09.114 --> 02:08:11.116
THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES. BUT

02:08:11.183 --> 02:08:14.453
IF YOU HAVE ELECTRONIC PORTAL TO

02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:16.622
PROVIDE ELECTRONIC DATA AND YOU

02:08:16.688 --> 02:08:18.857
JUST ARE CHOOSING NOT TO DO IT,

02:08:18.924 --> 02:08:20.893
THEN YOU WILL BE FOUND IN

02:08:20.959 --> 02:08:21.727
VIOLATION. BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO

02:08:21.794 --> 02:08:23.495
MEET THE TIMELINES IMPOSED BY

02:08:23.562 --> 02:08:25.898
THIS BILL IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE

02:08:25.964 --> 02:08:27.566
MECHANISM. THIS ONLY EXISTS IF

02:08:27.633 --> 02:08:34.940
YOU HAVE THAT IN PLACE. LASTLY,

02:08:35.007 --> 02:08:37.409
WHILE THERE'S SO MUCH TECHNICAL,

02:08:37.476 --> 02:08:40.579
TECHNICAL, SO MUCH TECHNICAL

02:08:40.646 --> 02:08:42.414
PROVISIONS TO THIS BILL, THE END

02:08:42.481 --> 02:08:45.017
GOAL IS STILL ALL THE SAME

02:08:45.084 --> 02:08:46.852
ENTITIES THAT HAVE STARTED FROM

02:08:46.919 --> 02:08:48.320
2024. TO SIGN UP TO THOSE

02:08:48.387 --> 02:08:49.555
SMALLER ENTITIES THAT JUST

02:08:49.621 --> 02:08:52.591
SIGNED UP IN JANUARY OF 2026,

02:08:52.658 --> 02:08:53.892
HAVE SIGNED A CONTRACT,

02:08:53.959 --> 02:08:55.461
SOMETIMES WITH THE DEPARTMENT,

02:08:55.527 --> 02:08:57.930
AS A COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE

02:08:57.996 --> 02:08:59.131
CONTRACTING WITH THE DEPARTMENT,

02:08:59.198 --> 02:09:01.200
TO SAY THEY'RE GOING TO DATA

02:09:01.266 --> 02:09:03.735
DATA EXCHANGE, BUT AREN'T REALLY

02:09:03.802 --> 02:09:05.070
DOING IT. THE GOVERNING BOARD IS

02:09:05.137 --> 02:09:06.538
GOING TO BRING SOME

02:09:06.605 --> 02:09:08.474
ACCOUNTABILITY, SOME

02:09:08.540 --> 02:09:09.575
TRANSPARENCY, SOME NUDGING OF

THESE ENTITIES TO ENSURE WE'RE

02:09:11.310 --> 02:09:13.378
SHARING THAT DATA, DATA SO THAT

02:09:13.445 --> 02:09:15.380
IF SOMEONE GOES TO SOME HOSPITAL

02:09:15.447 --> 02:09:17.382
IN SAN DIEGO AND FOR SOME REASON

02:09:17.449 --> 02:09:19.151
THEY MOVED TO LA, THAT DATA CAN

02:09:19.218 --> 02:09:21.453
BE SHARED OVER THERE AND THEY

02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:22.187
DON'T HAVE TO RESTART THE

02:09:22.254 --> 02:09:23.555
SERVICES OF HEALTHCARE

02:09:23.622 --> 02:09:24.923
COLLEAGUES. I ENDED AT THERE,

OVER TO MY WITNESSES WHO WILL

02:09:28.527 --> 02:09:30.362
SPEAK IN SUPPORT. I HAVE SOME

02:10:05.731 --> 02:10:08.467
YEARS AGO, WHEN CALIFORNIA FIRST

02:10:08.534 --> 02:10:09.902
ESTABLISHED THE DATA EXCHANGE

02:10:09.968 --> 02:10:11.336
FRAMEWORK, WE DID WONDER IF WE

LABEL OF PROVIDER ORGANIZATIONS

02:10:15.807 --> 02:10:17.809
AND MEDICAL GROUPS DIDN'T

02:10:17.876 --> 02:10:19.278
CLEARLY REFLECT THE UNIQUE ROLE

02:10:19.344 --> 02:10:20.379
OF HEALTH CENTERS ACROSS OUR

02:10:20.445 --> 02:10:22.447

INFORMATION ORGANIZATION. WE

02:10:37.429 --> 02:10:39.731
KNOW THAT A ROBUST, SECURE DATA

02:10:39.798 --> 02:10:42.067
SHARING ISN'T JUST A TECHNICAL

02:10:42.134 --> 02:10:43.502
GOAL. IT'S FUNDAMENTAL TO

02:10:43.569 --> 02:10:44.570
DELIVERING HIGH QUALITY, TIMELY

02:10:44.636 --> 02:10:46.638

02:10:49.875 --> 02:10:50.909
CONFIDENCE THAT OTHERS

GOVERNANCE OR ACCOUNTABILITY,

02:10:57.849 --> 02:10:59.318
IT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR

02:10:59.384 --> 02:11:00.686
INDIVIDUAL ORGANIZATIONS TO MAKE

02:11:00.752 --> 02:11:02.154
PROGRESS WITHOUT ALL PARTNERS.

02:11:02.221 --> 02:11:03.555

02:11:10.162 --> 02:11:13.699
WHY WE SUPPORT SB 660 BY
