00:53:28.638 --> 00:53:30.507
THE HIGH SCHOOL VOTER

00:53:30.574 --> 00:53:32.242
REGISTRATION ACT. ON BEHALF OF

00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:34.411
SENATOR REYES. I WOULD ALSO LIKE

00:53:34.477 --> 00:53:35.545
TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR

00:53:35.612 --> 00:53:38.381
THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL. EVERY

00:53:38.448 --> 00:53:39.783
ELECTION CYCLE, WE DISCUSS HOW

00:53:39.849 --> 00:53:41.551
LOW THE VOTER TURNOUT IS ACROSS

00:53:41.618 --> 00:53:43.720
THE COUNTRY, ESPECIALLY FOR OUR

00:53:43.787 --> 00:53:45.989
YOUNGEST VOTERS. WE NEED TO DO

00:53:46.056 --> 00:53:47.791
MORE TO INSTILL IN OUR YOUTH THE

00:53:47.857 --> 00:53:49.426
IMPORTANCE OF VOTING AND

00:53:49.492 --> 00:53:51.294
SIMPLIFY THE CIVIC ENGAGEMENT

00:53:51.361 --> 00:53:54.364
PROCESS. SB 316 IS AN EXCELLENT

00:53:54.431 --> 00:53:56.333
TOOL THAT WOULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE

00:53:56.399 --> 00:53:58.602
FOR 16 AND 17 YEAR OLDS TO

00:53:58.668 --> 00:54:00.370
PRE-REGISTER TO VOTE SO THAT

00:54:00.437 --> 00:54:02.005
UPON THEIR 18TH BIRTHDAY, THEY

00:54:02.072 --> 00:54:04.307
ARE AUTOMATICALLY REGISTERED

00:54:04.374 --> 00:54:05.642
VOTERS. IN ADDITION, IT WOULD

00:54:05.709 --> 00:54:07.077
PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH

00:54:07.143 --> 00:54:09.346
INFORMATION ON IN-PERSON VOTING

00:54:09.412 --> 00:54:10.780
OPPORTUNITIES, VOTE BY MAIL

00:54:10.847 --> 00:54:11.881
PROCEDURES, INCLUDING THE

00:54:11.948 --> 00:54:13.950
IMPORTANCE OF VOTER SIGNATURE,

00:54:14.017 --> 00:54:16.186
BALLOT TRACKING SERVICES,

00:54:16.252 --> 00:54:18.288
SERVICES PROVIDED TO VOTERS WITH

00:54:18.355 --> 00:54:19.689
DISABILITIES, AND KEY ELECTION

00:54:19.756 --> 00:54:22.392
DATES AND DEADLINES. BY BRINGING

00:54:22.459 --> 00:54:24.461
THE RESOURCES DIRECTLY TO OUR

00:54:24.527 --> 00:54:26.596
YOUTH, WE CAN ENSURE THAT THEY

00:54:26.663 --> 00:54:27.831
ARE DEVELOPING THE HABIT OF

00:54:27.897 --> 00:54:29.766
BEING CIVICALLY ENGAGED

00:54:29.833 --> 00:54:31.568
REGARDLESS OF THEIR PARTY

00:54:31.635 --> 00:54:33.436
AFFILIATION. CIVIC ENGAGEMENT IS

00:54:33.503 --> 00:54:35.005
AN INVALUABLE CONTRIBUTION TO

00:54:35.071 --> 00:54:37.741
OUR DEMOCRACY, AND SB 316 WILL

00:54:37.807 --> 00:54:39.476
INCREASE PARTICIPATION ON

00:54:39.542 --> 00:54:42.078
ELECTION DAY. HERE TO TESTIFY IN

00:54:42.145 --> 00:54:44.214
SUPPORT ARE JUNIOR TORRES

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:45.315
GUTIERREZ, A STUDENT FROM THE

00:54:45.382 --> 00:54:48.284
INLAND EMPIRE, AND RUTH SOSA

00:54:48.351 --> 00:54:51.755
MARTINEZ. ON BEHALF OF POWER

00:54:51.821 --> 00:54:56.459
CALIFORNIA ACTION. HELLO. FIRST

00:54:56.526 --> 00:54:57.460
AND FOREMOST, MY NAME IS RUBEN

00:54:57.527 --> 00:54:59.562
TORRES. I CURRENTLY I AM A HIGH

00:54:59.629 --> 00:55:00.697
SCHOOL STUDENT IN SAN

00:55:00.764 --> 00:55:02.298
BERNARDINO. I'M HERE WITH THE

00:55:02.365 --> 00:55:03.566
INLAND CONGREGATIONS UNITED FOR

00:55:03.633 --> 00:55:05.669
CHANGE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF MY

00:55:05.735 --> 00:55:06.302
COMMUNITY. I'M HERE IN STRONG

00:55:06.369 --> 00:55:08.405
SUPPORT OF SB 316, THE HIGH

00:55:08.471 --> 00:55:12.242
SCHOOL VOTER REGISTRATION ACT NOW. CURRENTLY, AS IT

00:55:12.308 --> 00:55:13.510
STANDS, CALIFORNIA LAW REQUIRES

00:55:13.576 --> 00:55:15.111
HIGH SCHOOL TO OFFER A SEMESTER

00:55:15.178 --> 00:55:16.179
LONG TO PARTICIPATE IN VOTER

00:55:16.246 --> 00:55:17.580
EDUCATION WEEKS, WHERE STUDENTS

00:55:17.647 --> 00:55:19.683
CAN REGISTER TO VOTE. WHILE THIS

00:55:19.749 --> 00:55:21.651
SOUNDS PROMISING ON PAPER, THE

00:55:21.718 --> 00:55:23.386
RESULTS TELL A DIFFERENT STORY.

00:55:23.453 --> 00:55:24.487
CURRENTLY, AS IT STANDS FROM

00:55:24.554 --> 00:55:25.955
2024, THE PUBLIC POLICY

00:55:26.022 --> 00:55:27.057
INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA FOUND

00:55:27.123 --> 00:55:28.925
THAT VOTER TURNOUT AMONG 18 TO

00:55:28.992 --> 00:55:30.960
24 YEAR OLDS HAVE DROPPED BY

00:55:31.027 --> 00:55:32.729
12.7 PERCENTAGE POINTS EACH

00:55:32.796 --> 00:55:34.264
YEAR. THE VOTER TURNOUT GETS

00:55:34.330 --> 00:55:36.199
LOW. THIS SHOWS US TWO TRUTHS.

00:55:36.266 --> 00:55:38.034
FIRST, THAT YOUTH TURNOUT IN

00:55:38.101 --> 00:55:39.235
CALIFORNIA IS ALARMINGLY LOW,

00:55:39.302 --> 00:55:40.570
AND SECOND, THAT OUR CURRENT

00:55:40.637 --> 00:55:41.705
CIVIC EDUCATION SYSTEM IS NOT

00:55:41.771 --> 00:55:42.972
PREPARING STUDENTS TO

00:55:43.039 --> 00:55:45.742
PARTICIPATE IN OUR DEMOCRACY. SB

00:55:45.809 --> 00:55:47.644
316 WOULD CHANGE THAT. THIS BILL

00:55:47.711 --> 00:55:49.312
GOES BEYOND ENCOURAGING CIVIC

00:55:49.379 --> 00:55:51.247
ENGAGEMENT. SB 316 ENSURES THAT

00:55:51.314 --> 00:55:52.816
EVERY 11TH GRADE STUDENT

00:55:52.882 --> 00:55:53.917
RECEIVES CLEAR, PRACTICAL

00:55:53.983 --> 00:55:55.185
INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO

00:55:55.251 --> 00:55:57.287
REGISTER AND HOW TO PRE-REGISTER

00:55:57.353 --> 00:55:59.522
TO VOTE, WHAT THE RIGHTS ARE AND

00:55:59.589 --> 00:56:00.356
HOW TO ACTUALLY PARTICIPATE

00:56:00.423 --> 00:56:01.558
THROUGH ELECTIONS, THROUGH MOCK

00:56:01.624 --> 00:56:02.692
TRIALS, DEBATES AND SO ON.

00:56:02.759 --> 00:56:04.427
THAT'S PROVIDED IN THE BILL

00:56:04.494 --> 00:56:06.463
RIGHT NOW. MANY STUDENTS DO NOT

00:56:06.529 --> 00:56:08.331
SIMPLY KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN, OR

00:56:08.398 --> 00:56:10.233
WHETHER THEY'RE ELIGIBLE TO

00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:12.068
PRE-REGISTER AT THE AGE OF 16.

00:56:12.135 --> 00:56:14.537
SB 316 MAKES SURE THAT CIVIC

00:56:14.604 --> 00:56:16.272
EDUCATION ISN'T JUST A CHECKBOX,

00:56:16.339 --> 00:56:18.141
BUT RATHER THAT SCHOOLS SHOW THE

00:56:18.208 --> 00:56:20.310
STUDENTS HOW TO PARTICIPATE. IN

00:56:20.376 --> 00:56:21.911
MY COMMUNITY AND COMMUNITIES

00:56:21.978 --> 00:56:23.513
ACROSS CALIFORNIA, I'VE SEEN HOW

00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:27.283
MANY STUDENTS ARE UNSURE,

00:56:27.350 --> 00:56:28.151
INTIMIDATED, AND SIMPLY SIMPLY

00:56:28.218 --> 00:56:29.986
UNAWARE HOW TO ENGAGE CIVICALLY.

00:56:30.053 --> 00:56:31.221
SOME ARE AFRAID TO PARTICIPATE

00:56:31.287 --> 00:56:33.223
IN A DEMOCRACY BECAUSE NO ONE

00:56:33.289 --> 00:56:35.759
SHOWS THEM HOW TO DO IT. SB 316

00:56:35.825 --> 00:56:37.560
IS THAT GUIDANCE? AS A YOUNG

00:56:37.627 --> 00:56:38.628
LEADER IN SAN BERNARDINO,

00:56:38.695 --> 00:56:40.096
CALIFORNIA, I'VE HAD COUNTLESS

00:56:40.163 --> 00:56:41.231
CONVERSATIONS WITH PEOPLE WHO

00:56:41.297 --> 00:56:42.465
SAY THINGS LIKE, WHY SHOULD I

00:56:42.532 --> 00:56:44.300
VOTE IN THE FUTURE? NOTHING I

00:56:44.367 --> 00:56:46.069
WILL DO WILL CHANGE. AND I GET

00:56:46.136 --> 00:56:47.971
IT BECAUSE MANY TIMES I FELT

00:56:48.037 --> 00:56:49.539
LIKE THAT AS WAY TOO. IT IS EASY

00:56:49.606 --> 00:56:51.875
TO FEEL POWERLESS THAN TO FEEL

00:56:51.941 --> 00:56:53.009
COURAGEOUS. THE REAL ISSUE IS

00:56:53.076 --> 00:56:55.044
THAT NO ONE SHOWS THEM HOW TO

00:56:55.111 --> 00:56:56.246
PARTICIPATE AND SHOW THEM HOW

00:56:56.312 --> 00:56:58.882
POWERFUL THEIR VOICES ARE. THAT

00:56:58.948 --> 00:57:00.950
IS WHY CIVIC EDUCATION IS SO

00:57:01.017 --> 00:57:02.519
IMPORTANT. WE CANNOT EXPECT OUR

00:57:02.585 --> 00:57:04.220
YOUTH TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR

00:57:04.287 --> 00:57:04.988
SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT WHEN WE

00:57:05.054 --> 00:57:06.322
NEVER SHOW THEM HOW MEANINGFUL

00:57:06.389 --> 00:57:08.591
THEIR PARTICIPATION LOOKS LIKE.

00:57:08.658 --> 00:57:09.926
SIMPLY OFFERING THEM AS AN

00:57:09.993 --> 00:57:12.462
OPTION ISN'T ENOUGH. IT IS A

00:57:12.529 --> 00:57:13.663
RESPONSIBILITY AS A STUDENT AND

00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:15.498
TO SHOW OTHERS WHAT HAVING A

00:57:15.565 --> 00:57:17.467
VOICE LOOKS LIKE. AND. AND IT

00:57:17.534 --> 00:57:19.569
SHOULD ALSO BE THE

00:57:19.636 --> 00:57:20.770
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE OF

00:57:20.837 --> 00:57:21.604
CALIFORNIA TO SHOW STUDENTS THAT

00:57:21.671 --> 00:57:24.507
THEY HAVE A VOICE. SB 316 IS

00:57:24.574 --> 00:57:30.513
DOING JUST THAT. THANK YOU. YOU

00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:33.016
HAVE TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU.

00:57:33.082 --> 00:57:34.317
GOOD MORNING. MEMBERS OF THE

00:57:34.384 --> 00:57:35.919
COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS RUTH SOSA

00:57:35.985 --> 00:57:37.220
MARTINEZ. I'M THE POLICY

00:57:37.287 --> 00:57:38.988
STRATEGIST WITH POWER CA ACTION

00:57:39.055 --> 00:57:42.659
AND A PROUD CO-SPONSOR OF SB 316

00:57:42.725 --> 00:57:44.127
AT POWER CA ACTION. WE WORK TO

00:57:44.194 --> 00:57:46.029
BUILD YOUTH POWER IN CALIFORNIA

00:57:46.095 --> 00:57:47.230
THROUGH CIVIC ENGAGEMENT. WE

00:57:47.297 --> 00:57:48.898
KNOW FROM DIRECT EXPERIENCE THAT

00:57:48.965 --> 00:57:50.934
THE EARLIER YOUNG PEOPLE ARE

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.436
INTRODUCED TO THE DEMOCRATIC

00:57:53.503 --> 00:57:55.305
PROCESS, THE MORE LIKELY THEY

00:57:55.371 --> 00:57:56.406
ARE TO BECOME LIFELONG VOTERS.

00:57:56.472 --> 00:57:57.674
IN FACT, YOUNG CALIFORNIANS ARE

00:57:57.740 --> 00:57:59.843
ON TRACK TO BE THE LARGEST

00:57:59.909 --> 00:58:03.213
VOTING BLOC IN IN THE STATE BY

00:58:03.279 --> 00:58:04.948
2028. BUT OUR SYSTEMS ARE NOT

00:58:05.014 --> 00:58:07.083
BUILT TO SUPPORT THEM. WHILE WE

00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:08.384
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT EXISTING LAW

00:58:08.451 --> 00:58:09.452
ENCOURAGES SCHOOLS TO FACILITATE

00:58:09.519 --> 00:58:11.054
VOTER REGISTRATION,

00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:12.488
IMPLEMENTATION HAS BEEN

00:58:12.555 --> 00:58:15.024
INCONSISTENT. IN 2022, FEWER

00:58:15.091 --> 00:58:17.093
THAN HALF OF THE HIGH SCHOOLS

00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:17.694
RESPONDED TO THE SECRETARY OF

00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:19.395
STATE'S ANNUAL SURVEY, AND MANY

00:58:19.462 --> 00:58:20.463
SCHOOLS REPORTED BEING UNAWARE

00:58:20.530 --> 00:58:22.599
OF THE REQUIREMENTS. ALTOGETHER.

00:58:22.665 --> 00:58:25.501
SB 316 SETS A SIMPLE, CLEAR

00:58:25.568 --> 00:58:27.070
STANDARD. THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT

00:58:27.136 --> 00:58:28.438
FIXING A COMPLIANCE ISSUE, IT'S

00:58:28.504 --> 00:58:30.940
ABOUT EQUITY. EVERY STUDENT,

00:58:31.007 --> 00:58:32.008
REGARDLESS OF THE SCHOOL THEY

00:58:32.075 --> 00:58:33.877
ATTEND OR THE RESOURCES THEIR

00:58:33.943 --> 00:58:36.779
SCHOOL HAS, DESERVES ACCESS TO

00:58:36.846 --> 00:58:38.681
CLEAR, ACCESSIBLE INFORMATION

00:58:38.748 --> 00:58:40.183
ABOUT HOW TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR

00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:43.086
DEMOCRACY. SB 316 AIMS TO SHIFT

00:58:43.152 --> 00:58:44.587
THAT. IT CREATES A SIMPLE, LOW

00:58:44.654 --> 00:58:46.322
COST STANDARD REQUIRING HIGH

00:58:46.389 --> 00:58:47.657
SCHOOLS TO DISTRIBUTE VOTER

00:58:47.724 --> 00:58:49.525
REGISTRATION MATERIALS AND

00:58:49.592 --> 00:58:51.227
INFORMATIONAL NOTICES TO

00:58:51.294 --> 00:58:52.962
STUDENTS BEFORE THE END OF THEIR

00:58:53.029 --> 00:58:55.098
11TH GRADE. THE BILL CREATES

00:58:55.164 --> 00:58:57.133
CONSISTENCY, CLARITY, AND

00:58:57.200 --> 00:58:58.034
ACCOUNTABILITY IN HOW WE REACH

00:58:58.101 --> 00:58:59.636
YOUNG VOTERS AND HOW WE CREATE

00:58:59.702 --> 00:59:01.271
PATHWAYS FOR THEIR POLITICAL

00:59:01.337 --> 00:59:02.906
PARTICIPATION IN CALIFORNIA. AT

00:59:02.972 --> 00:59:05.008
POWER KÃ² ACTION, WE WORK WITH A

00:59:05.074 --> 00:59:06.342
LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE ACROSS THE

00:59:06.409 --> 00:59:07.410
STATE, MANY IN RURAL

00:59:07.477 --> 00:59:08.745
COMMUNITIES, IN LOW INCOME

00:59:08.811 --> 00:59:10.146
COMMUNITIES WHERE CIVIC

00:59:10.213 --> 00:59:11.547
INFRASTRUCTURE IS WEAK. AND

00:59:11.614 --> 00:59:13.283
OFTEN THESE STUDENTS DON'T HAVE

00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:14.984
THE GENERATIONAL KNOWLEDGE TO

00:59:15.051 --> 00:59:18.254
PARTICIPATE. SB 316 ENSURES THAT

00:59:18.321 --> 00:59:20.290
NO MATTER YOUR ZIP CODE, YOU

00:59:20.356 --> 00:59:21.591
GRADUATE WITH THE TOOLS TO

00:59:21.658 --> 00:59:23.893
BECOME A LIFELONG VOTER. SCHOOLS

00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:25.428
ALREADY HAVE ACCESS TO FREE

00:59:25.495 --> 00:59:26.663
REGISTRATION MATERIALS THROUGH

00:59:26.729 --> 00:59:28.932
THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE.

00:59:28.998 --> 00:59:30.600
WHAT'S BEEN MISSING IS THE

00:59:30.667 --> 00:59:31.200
STRUCTURE AND ACCOUNTABILITY

00:59:31.267 --> 00:59:34.137
THAT SB 316 PROVIDES. THIS IS A

00:59:34.203 --> 00:59:35.638
PRACTICAL, LOW COST FIX TO A

00:59:35.705 --> 00:59:37.140
SYSTEMIC BARRIER, AND MORE

00:59:37.206 --> 00:59:38.274
IMPORTANTLY, IT'S A SIGNAL TO

00:59:38.341 --> 00:59:39.809
YOUNG PEOPLE THAT THEIR VOICES

00:59:39.876 --> 00:59:41.811
MATTER. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

00:59:41.878 --> 00:59:43.146
TECHNICAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

00:59:43.212 --> 00:59:46.249
BILL'S IMPLEMENTATION, AND WANT

00:59:46.316 --> 00:59:48.451
TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND

00:59:48.518 --> 00:59:49.452
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE

00:59:49.519 --> 00:59:50.687
VOTE. THANK YOU. ARE THERE

00:59:50.753 --> 00:59:51.321
ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT

00:59:51.387 --> 00:59:53.856

I LIKE TO LOOK AT PREVIOUS VOTES

01:02:11.594 --> 01:02:13.262
OF THE PAST AND THOSE WHO HAVE

01:02:13.329 --> 01:02:15.698
VOTED ON THIS BILL. AND THE

01:02:15.765 --> 01:02:17.233
AUTHOR OF THIS BILL DIDN'T EVEN

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:20.369
VOTE ON THIS BILL. CAN I ASK A

01:02:20.436 --> 01:02:21.204
QUESTION? WHERE IS THE AUTHOR

01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:26.542
AND WHY HASN'T? SENATOR REYES

01:02:26.609 --> 01:02:29.745
VOTED ON THIS? SHE HAS A MEDICAL

01:02:29.812 --> 01:02:33.583
LEAVE. OKAY, IT'S INTERESTING.

01:02:33.649 --> 01:02:38.688
THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR MY

01:02:38.754 --> 01:02:39.722
CONCERNS. COME FROM ANOTHER

01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:42.091
PLACE THAT I CAME INTO THIS,

01:02:42.158 --> 01:02:43.526
THAT I WANT YOUNG PEOPLE TO HAVE

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:45.595
A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP WITH

01:02:45.661 --> 01:02:47.396
POLITICS. AND AT A TIME THAT

01:02:47.463 --> 01:02:49.398
WHEN YOU TURN ON THE TV, THAT

01:02:49.465 --> 01:02:50.066
DOESN'T HAPPEN. THAT'S SOMETHING

01:02:50.133 --> 01:02:52.135
THAT ALL OF US UP HERE SHOULD

01:02:52.201 --> 01:02:53.369
WANT IS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE WANT

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:54.470
TO BE ENGAGED CIVICALLY, AND

01:02:54.537 --> 01:02:56.072
THEY WANT TO HAVE A GOOD

01:02:56.139 --> 01:02:57.373
RELATIONSHIP AND BE AN EDUCATED

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.208
VOTER. SO I APPLAUD BOTH OF YOU

01:02:59.275 --> 01:03:01.043
FOR BEING HERE TODAY. I'M VERY

01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:01.944
GRATEFUL YOU DON'T LIVE IN MY

01:03:02.011 --> 01:03:03.312
DISTRICT BECAUSE YOU MIGHT BE

01:03:03.379 --> 01:03:04.947
COMING FOR MY JOB WHEN YOU'RE OF

01:03:05.014 --> 01:03:07.850
AGE TO RUN FOR MY SEAT. THE MAIN

01:03:07.917 --> 01:03:08.417
CONCERN THAT I HAVE IS WE

01:03:08.484 --> 01:03:09.986
ALREADY HAVE SO MANY UNFUNDED

01:03:10.052 --> 01:03:11.454
MANDATES RIGHT NOW ON THE

01:03:11.521 --> 01:03:13.990
SCHOOLS THAT IF I THOUGHT WE

01:03:14.056 --> 01:03:16.459
WERE ABLE TO PUT OUR MONEY WHERE

01:03:16.526 --> 01:03:17.827
OUR MOUTH IS WITH THIS, I WOULD

01:03:17.894 --> 01:03:19.028
BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT, BECAUSE I

01:03:19.095 --> 01:03:21.330
DO WANT YOUNG PEOPLE TO GET

01:03:21.397 --> 01:03:21.964
REGISTERED TO VOTE. BUT BECAUSE

01:03:22.031 --> 01:03:24.066
OF THE FACT THAT THIS

01:03:24.133 --> 01:03:25.168
POTENTIALLY COULD BE AN UNFUNDED

01:03:25.234 --> 01:03:26.636
MANDATE, I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO

01:03:26.702 --> 01:03:28.337
SUPPORT TODAY. BUT I DO APPLAUD

01:03:28.404 --> 01:03:29.071
YOUR CIVIC ENGAGEMENT. BE A

01:03:29.138 --> 01:03:30.039
LEADER IN YOUR COMMUNITY.

01:03:30.106 --> 01:03:31.240
ENCOURAGE YOUR FRIENDS AND YOUR

01:03:31.307 --> 01:03:33.276
PEERS TO ALSO DO THE SAME. AND

01:03:33.342 --> 01:03:35.044
UP HERE, WE WILL DO OUR PART TO

01:03:35.111 --> 01:03:36.078
ENCOURAGE YOUNG PEOPLE TO GET

01:03:36.145 --> 01:03:38.247
ENROLLED TO VOTE. AND I KNOW AS

01:03:38.314 --> 01:03:40.216
BEING AN ELECTION OFFICIAL,

01:03:40.283 --> 01:03:40.716
THAT'S SOMETHING YOU'RE

01:03:40.783 --> 01:03:41.317
PASSIONATE ABOUT AS WELL. SO

01:03:41.384 --> 01:03:42.818
WITH THAT, IS THERE ANYBODY

01:03:42.885 --> 01:03:43.586
ELSE? Ã ASSEMBLYMEMBER

01:08:16.459 --> 01:08:17.927
ELECTIONS OF APPELLATE AND

01:08:17.993 --> 01:08:21.230
SUPREME COURT JUSTICES UNDER THE

01:08:21.297 --> 01:08:22.631
PROCEDURE THAT HAS BEEN IN PLACE

01:08:22.698 --> 01:08:24.333
SINCE THAT TIME. GOVERNOR. THE

01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:26.168
GOVERNOR NOMINATES APPELLATE AND

01:08:26.235 --> 01:08:28.270

01:08:29.472 --> 01:08:31.207
COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL

01:08:31.273 --> 01:08:33.275
APPOINTMENTS. CONFIRMED JUSTICES

01:08:33.342 --> 01:08:35.244
ARE SUBJECT TO VOTER APPROVAL AT

01:08:35.311 --> 01:08:36.679
THE NEXT GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION

01:08:36.745 --> 01:08:38.781
AND AT THE END OF EACH 12 YEAR

01:08:38.848 --> 01:08:41.951
TERM. THESE ARE CALLED RETENTION

01:08:42.017 --> 01:08:43.786
ELECTIONS AND RETENTION

01:08:43.853 --> 01:08:46.322
ELECTIONS. JUSTICES DO NOT RUN

01:08:46.388 --> 01:08:48.424
AGAINST OPPOSING CANDIDATES.

01:08:48.491 --> 01:08:50.259
INSTEAD, BALLOTS ASK VOTERS TO

01:08:50.326 --> 01:08:52.728
VOTE YES OR NO ON WHETHER THE

01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:55.264
JUSTICE SHOULD BE RETAINED.

01:08:55.331 --> 01:08:57.132
SINCE THAT PROCEDURE WAS CREATED

01:08:57.199 --> 01:09:00.302
IN 1934, JUSTICES HAVE

01:09:00.369 --> 01:09:01.403
SUCCESSFULLY BEEN RETAINED IN

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:05.040
MORE THAN 99.5% OF RETENTION

01:09:05.107 --> 01:09:07.243
ELECTIONS. THREE SUPREME COURT

01:09:07.309 --> 01:09:09.278
JUSTICES WHO WERE DEFEATED IN

01:09:09.345 --> 01:09:12.181
1986 ARE THE ONLY TIME IN THE

01:09:12.248 --> 01:09:13.582
STATE'S HISTORY THAT A JUSTICE

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:16.886
WAS NOT SUCCESSFULLY RETAINED.

01:09:16.952 --> 01:09:18.454
CALIFORNIA'S GENERAL ELECTION

01:09:18.521 --> 01:09:19.788
BALLOTS ARE LENGTHY,

01:09:19.855 --> 01:09:21.223
PARTICULARLY IN GUBERNATORIAL

01:09:21.290 --> 01:09:22.358
ELECTIONS, WHEN JUDICIAL

01:09:22.424 --> 01:09:23.592
RETENTION ELECTIONS APPEAR ON

01:09:23.659 --> 01:09:26.228
THE BALLOT. JUDICIAL RETENTION

01:09:26.295 --> 01:09:27.796
ELECTIONS CAN ADD MORE THAN A

01:09:27.863 --> 01:09:29.498
DOZEN ADDITIONAL CONTESTS TO THE

01:09:29.565 --> 01:09:31.667
BALLOT. LENGTHY BALLOTS

01:09:31.734 --> 01:09:33.168
CONTRIBUTE TO VOTER FATIGUE AND

01:09:33.235 --> 01:09:35.638
MAKE THE ELECTORAL PROCESS MORE

01:09:35.704 --> 01:09:37.373
DAUNTING, ESPECIALLY FOR NEW AND

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:39.608
INFREQUENT VOTERS, WHILE ADDING

01:09:39.675 --> 01:09:42.144
TO ELECTION COSTS. FURTHERMORE,

01:09:42.211 --> 01:09:43.812
VOTERS SKIP VOTING ON ELECTION

01:09:43.879 --> 01:09:46.148
RETENTION ELECTIONS AT HIGH

01:09:46.215 --> 01:09:47.082
LEVELS. THE PERCENTAGE OF

01:09:47.149 --> 01:09:48.984
BALLOTS THAT ARE LEFT BLANK IN

01:09:49.051 --> 01:09:50.452
RETENTION ELECTIONS REGULARLY

01:09:50.519 --> 01:09:53.389

40% IN SOME RECENT RETENTION

ELECTIONS. VOTERS ALSO REGULARLY

01:09:58.727 --> 01:10:00.563
EXPRESS FRUSTRATION WITH THE

01:10:00.629 --> 01:10:01.964
LIMITED AMOUNT OF INFORMATION

01:10:02.031 --> 01:10:03.566
AVAILABLE ABOUT JUSTICES WHO ARE

01:10:03.632 --> 01:10:05.935
ON THE BALLOT IN RETENTION

01:10:06.001 --> 01:10:08.404
ELECTIONS. ACR EIGHT ASKED

01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:09.805
CALIFORNIA VOTERS WHETHER THEY

01:10:09.872 --> 01:10:12.474
WANT TO AMEND THE CALIFORNIA

01:10:12.541 --> 01:10:13.475
CONSTITUTION TO PROVIDE THAT

01:10:13.542 --> 01:10:15.911
COURT OF APPEALS AND SUPREME

01:10:15.978 --> 01:10:17.179
COURT JUSTICES WILL APPEAR ON

01:10:17.246 --> 01:10:18.948
THE BALLOT FOR RETENTION

01:10:19.014 --> 01:10:21.116
ELECTION ONLY IF A PETITION IS

01:10:21.183 --> 01:10:23.586
FILED BY REGISTERED VOTERS. IF

01:10:23.652 --> 01:10:25.321
NO PETITION IS FILED, THE

01:10:25.387 --> 01:10:26.455
JUSTICE WOULD BE RETAINED

01:10:26.522 --> 01:10:28.524
WITHOUT APPEARING ON THE BALLOT.

01:10:28.591 --> 01:10:30.459
THIS PROCESS IS MODELED AFTER

01:10:30.526 --> 01:10:32.161
THE PROCESS THAT CURRENTLY

01:10:32.227 --> 01:10:34.363
EXISTS FOR SUPERIOR COURT

01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:36.498
ELECTIONS. AC EIGHT IS A

01:10:36.565 --> 01:10:38.400
TARGETED APPROACH TO ADDRESS THE

01:10:38.467 --> 01:10:40.069
CHALLENGES POSED BY CALIFORNIA'S

01:10:40.135 --> 01:10:42.037
LENGTHY BALLOTS AND TO SAVE

01:10:42.104 --> 01:10:43.639
MONEY FOR ELECTION COSTS WHILE

01:10:43.706 --> 01:10:45.507
PROTECTING JUDICIAL

01:10:45.574 --> 01:10:47.376
ACCOUNTABILITY BY MAINTAINING

01:10:47.443 --> 01:10:49.478
VOTERS ABILITY TO REMOVE

01:10:49.545 --> 01:10:51.280
APPELLATE AND SUPREME COURT

01:10:51.347 --> 01:10:53.349
JUSTICES WHEN DESIRED. JOINING

01:10:53.415 --> 01:10:56.752
ME IN SUPPORT OF ACA IS TIM

LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS, MADAM

01:11:05.794 --> 01:11:07.196
CHAIR AND MEMBERS TIM CROMARTIE,

01:11:07.262 --> 01:11:09.331
ON BEHALF OF SECRETARY OF STATE.

01:11:09.398 --> 01:11:11.367
WEBER, SECRETARY OF STATE,

01:11:11.433 --> 01:11:12.868
SUPPORTS ASSEMBLY CONSTITUTIONAL

01:11:12.935 --> 01:11:13.902
AMENDMENT EIGHT, WHICH PROPOSES

01:11:13.969 --> 01:11:16.105
A MEANINGFUL REFORM TO THE

01:11:16.171 --> 01:11:17.840
JUDICIAL ELECTION PROVISIONS

01:11:17.906 --> 01:11:19.475
WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA

01:11:19.541 --> 01:11:21.343
CONSTITUTION. AC EIGHT

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:22.277
STREAMLINES THE PROCESS FOR

01:11:22.344 --> 01:11:23.846
RETAINING APPELLATE AND SUPREME

01:11:23.912 --> 01:11:25.547
COURT JUSTICES BY ALIGNING STATE

01:11:25.614 --> 01:11:27.016
LAW WITH EXISTING PRACTICE IN

01:11:27.082 --> 01:11:28.951
THE LOWER COURTS, ENSURING A

01:11:29.018 --> 01:11:30.486
MORE COST EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL

01:11:30.552 --> 01:11:32.321
ELECTION SYSTEM. THE SCOPE OF

01:11:32.388 --> 01:11:34.256
THE MEASURE IS LIMITED TO JUDGES

01:11:34.323 --> 01:11:36.525
WHO ARE RUNNING UNOPPOSED,

01:11:36.592 --> 01:11:37.359
BECAUSE EXPERIENCE TELLS US THAT

01:11:37.426 --> 01:11:39.261
THIS UNIVERSE OF JUDGES, AS HAS

01:11:39.328 --> 01:11:41.196
BEEN SAID, ARE CONSISTENTLY

01:11:41.263 --> 01:11:42.431
REELECTED. OUR OFFICE, THEREFORE

01:11:42.498 --> 01:11:43.899
HAS NO CONCERNS ABOUT VOTERS

01:11:43.966 --> 01:11:45.000
BEING DISENFRANCHIZED. AS A

01:11:45.067 --> 01:11:47.403
RESULT OF THIS MEASURE, AC WOULD

01:11:47.469 --> 01:11:49.071
ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO SPECIFY

01:11:49.138 --> 01:11:50.506
THAT THE NAMES OF THE INCUMBENT

01:11:50.572 --> 01:11:51.707
SUPREME COURT JUSTICES AND

01:11:51.774 --> 01:11:53.909
APPELLATE JUDGES WHO ARE RUNNING

01:11:53.976 --> 01:11:56.311
UNCONTESTED DO NOT APPEAR ON THE

01:11:56.378 --> 01:11:56.912
BALLOT UNLESS THE PETITION IS

01:11:56.979 --> 01:11:59.748
FILED REQUESTING INCLUSION. THIS

01:11:59.815 --> 01:12:01.116
REDUCES UNNECESSARY ELECTION

01:12:01.183 --> 01:12:03.285
CLUTTER AND HELPS FOCUS VOTER

01:12:03.352 --> 01:12:05.454
ATTENTION ON CONTESTED RACES.

01:12:05.521 --> 01:12:07.289
ACR IMPROVES THE INTEGRITY AND

01:12:07.356 --> 01:12:08.290
EFFICIENCY OF CALIFORNIA'S

01:12:08.357 --> 01:12:09.425
ELECTORAL SYSTEM WHILE

01:12:09.491 --> 01:12:11.560
MINIMIZING VOTER CONFUSION AND

01:12:11.627 --> 01:12:13.729
PRESERVING TRANSPARENCY. WE

01:12:13.796 --> 01:12:16.165
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

01:12:16.231 --> 01:12:18.300
MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS DAW ROSE,

01:12:18.367 --> 01:12:19.401
DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE LEAGUE OF

01:12:19.468 --> 01:12:21.737
WOMEN VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA, HERE

01:12:21.804 --> 01:12:23.138
IN SUPPORT OF AC EIGHT. THIS

01:12:23.205 --> 01:12:24.506
BILL WOULD WOULD ADDRESS A REAL

01:12:24.573 --> 01:12:25.908
CHALLENGE THAT WE SEE IN

01:12:25.974 --> 01:12:27.476
JUDICIAL RETENTION ELECTIONS.

01:12:27.543 --> 01:12:29.478
VOTERS ARE BEING ASKED TO WEIGH

01:12:29.545 --> 01:12:31.013
IN ON CONTESTS THAT RARELY

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.748
RESULT IN CHANGE, AND OFTEN COME

01:12:32.815 --> 01:12:34.349
WITH NO MEANINGFUL INFORMATION

01:12:34.416 --> 01:12:35.951
TO GUIDE THEIR DECISIONS. IN

01:12:36.018 --> 01:12:39.021
FACT, AS YOU'VE HEARD, OUT OF

01:12:39.088 --> 01:12:40.289
797 APPELLATE RETENTION

01:12:40.355 --> 01:12:42.991
ELECTIONS SINCE 1934, JUST THREE

01:12:43.058 --> 01:12:44.460
JUSTICES HAVE EVER LOST. THE

01:12:44.526 --> 01:12:46.061
REST HAVE BEEN RETAINED. SO

01:12:46.128 --> 01:12:48.330
RETENTION HAS VOTED FOR 99.6% OF

01:12:48.397 --> 01:12:50.199
THE TIME. THIS IS NOT THE SIGN

01:12:50.265 --> 01:12:52.034
OF A HEALTHY ELECTION SYSTEM.

01:12:52.101 --> 01:12:54.203
IT'S A SIGN THAT RACES ARE

01:12:54.269 --> 01:12:55.471
FUNCTIONALLY INVISIBLE, LEADING

01:12:55.537 --> 01:12:57.005
TO BALLOT ROLL OFF RATES THAT

01:12:57.072 --> 01:12:59.375
ROUTINELY EXCEED 25%, SOMETIMES

01:12:59.441 --> 01:13:01.577
EVEN UP TO 40%, AS YOU HEARD.

01:13:01.643 --> 01:13:03.278
AND WHEN VOTERS DO PARTICIPATE,

01:13:03.345 --> 01:13:04.880
IT'S OFTEN THROUGH GUESSING, NOT

01:13:04.947 --> 01:13:06.181
INFORMED CHOICE. THE LEAGUE HAS

01:13:06.248 --> 01:13:08.784
WORKED REALLY HARD TO FILL THIS

01:13:08.851 --> 01:13:09.618
INFORMATION GAP, CREATING

01:13:09.685 --> 01:13:10.919
EDUCATIONAL TOOLS AND VOTER

01:13:10.986 --> 01:13:12.788
GUIDES WHENEVER POSSIBLE, BUT

01:13:12.855 --> 01:13:14.223
WITHOUT DEDICATED FUNDING FOR

01:13:14.289 --> 01:13:15.924
MEANINGFUL JUDICIAL EVALUATION,

01:13:15.991 --> 01:13:17.826
OUR EFFORTS CAN ONLY GO SO FAR

01:13:17.893 --> 01:13:19.595
IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT GIVING

01:13:19.661 --> 01:13:20.596
VOTERS THE TOOLS TO MAKE

01:13:20.662 --> 01:13:22.164
INFORMED DECISIONS IN THESE

01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:24.299
CONTESTS, WE NEED A PUBLIC

01:13:24.366 --> 01:13:25.000
INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THAT

01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:26.835
WORK. IN THE ABSENCE OF THAT,

01:13:26.902 --> 01:13:29.271
AND ALMOST 100 YEARS, THERE HAS

01:13:29.338 --> 01:13:31.774
BEEN AN ABSENCE OF THAT. AC

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:32.841
ACTUALLY OFFERS A VERY

01:13:32.908 --> 01:13:35.010
THOUGHTFUL FIX. INSTEAD OF

01:13:35.077 --> 01:13:36.211
PLACING EVERY APPELLATE JUSTICE

01:13:36.278 --> 01:13:37.946
ON THE BALLOT BY DEFAULT, IT

01:13:38.013 --> 01:13:39.448
EMPOWERS VOTERS TO DECIDE WHEN

01:13:39.515 --> 01:13:40.749
AN ELECTION IS WARRANTED THROUGH

01:13:40.816 --> 01:13:42.651
A PETITION PROCESS. WE EXPECT TO

01:13:42.718 --> 01:13:43.652
WORK WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:13:43.719 --> 01:13:45.487
PELLERIN TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:13:45.554 --> 01:13:46.922
THRESHOLD FOR PETITION

01:13:46.989 --> 01:13:48.023
SIGNATURES ISN'T AN IMPOSSIBLE

01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:51.226
HURDLE TO MEET. THE LEAGUE HAS A

01:13:51.293 --> 01:13:52.394
LONG HISTORY OF ADVOCATING FOR

01:13:52.461 --> 01:13:53.762
JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND

01:13:53.829 --> 01:13:54.830
ACCOUNTABILITY. WE SUPPORTED THE

01:13:54.897 --> 01:13:56.598
ORIGINAL CREATION OF THE

01:13:56.665 --> 01:13:58.534
RETENTION SYSTEM BACK IN 1934.

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:00.636
WE WERE PROPONENTS OF IT ON THE

01:14:00.702 --> 01:14:02.704
BALLOT, AND TODAY WE SUPPORT

01:14:02.771 --> 01:14:03.906
MODERNIZING IT TO REFLECT HOW

01:14:03.972 --> 01:14:06.642
IT'S WORKING. IN PRACTICE, ACR

01:14:06.708 --> 01:14:08.110
EIGHT HELPS CLEAR SPACE ON THE

01:14:08.177 --> 01:14:09.978
BALLOT FOR CONTESTED ELECTIONS

01:14:10.045 --> 01:14:11.814
SO VOTERS CAN FOCUS ON CONTESTS

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:13.949
WHERE THEIR DECISIONS ARE MOST

01:14:14.016 --> 01:14:15.317
IMPACTFUL AND BEST INFORMED,

01:14:15.384 --> 01:14:16.418
WHILE PRESERVING THE PUBLIC'S

01:14:16.485 --> 01:14:18.120
POWER TO HOLD JUDGES ACCOUNTABLE

01:14:18.187 --> 01:14:19.254
WHEN IT TRULY MATTERS. BY

01:14:19.321 --> 01:14:20.322
GETTING THEM ON THE BALLOT

01:14:20.389 --> 01:14:22.191
THROUGH THE PETITION PROCESS. WE

01:14:22.257 --> 01:14:25.360
URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU.

01:14:25.427 --> 01:14:27.796
ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN

01:14:27.863 --> 01:14:30.566
SUPPORT? MEMBERS, ON BEHALF OF

01:14:30.632 --> 01:14:32.234
THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:33.368
ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT? THANK

01:14:33.435 --> 01:14:35.571
YOU, THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY

01:14:35.637 --> 01:14:37.673
OTHER HERE PEOPLE HERE IN

01:14:37.739 --> 01:14:40.475
SUPPORT NOW? ARE THERE ANY

01:14:40.542 --> 01:14:44.580
WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION? SEEING

01:14:44.646 --> 01:14:45.914
NONE. I WILL BRING IT BACK TO

01:14:45.981 --> 01:14:50.385
THE DÃAS. OKAY. SO I HAVE ONE

01:14:50.452 --> 01:14:51.720
MAIN CONCERN. AND YOU TOUCHED ON

01:14:51.787 --> 01:14:53.589
IT, WHICH IS WE DON'T HAVE THE

01:14:53.655 --> 01:14:55.390
NUMBER OF SIGNATURES THAT WE

01:14:55.457 --> 01:14:57.159
WOULD HIT THAT THRESHOLD. AND SO

01:14:57.226 --> 01:14:59.294
MY FIRST QUESTION IS, IS BEING

01:14:59.361 --> 01:15:01.163
THE AUTHOR, WOULD YOU BE WILLING

01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:03.198
TO NEGOTIATE THAT INTO THIS

01:15:03.265 --> 01:15:04.967
PARTICULAR ACA OF THE NUMBER OF

01:15:05.033 --> 01:15:06.235
SIGNATURES? WELL, WE DON'T WANT

01:15:06.301 --> 01:15:07.502
TO PUT IT IN THE CONSTITUTION.

01:15:07.569 --> 01:15:09.671
SO MY PLAN IS TO ABSOLUTELY SEE

01:15:09.738 --> 01:15:11.940
HOW PEOPLE ARE RESPONDING TO

01:15:12.007 --> 01:15:13.942
THIS IDEA. AND IF THIS IS

01:15:14.009 --> 01:15:15.077
SOMETHING THAT IS SUPPORTED,

01:15:15.143 --> 01:15:16.945
THEN I'LL BE WORKING ON

01:15:17.012 --> 01:15:18.347
LEGISLATION NEXT YEAR TO ARRIVE

01:15:18.413 --> 01:15:20.215
AT THAT NUMBER, WORKING WITH THE

01:15:20.282 --> 01:15:23.151
VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS CURRENTLY

01:15:23.218 --> 01:15:24.486
TO PUT THESE SUPERIOR COURT

01:15:24.553 --> 01:15:26.755
JUDGES ON THE BALLOT. THIS

01:15:26.822 --> 01:15:27.256
NUMBER OF SIGNATURES ARE

01:15:27.322 --> 01:15:31.059
ANYWHERE BETWEEN 106 HUNDRED

01:15:31.126 --> 01:15:33.428
600. AND WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE

01:15:33.495 --> 01:15:35.931
THIS AN ONEROUS TASK. WE WANT TO

01:15:35.998 --> 01:15:38.233
MAKE IT REASONABLE FOR VOTERS TO

01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:40.102
DECIDE IF THEY WANT TO PUT THE

01:15:40.168 --> 01:15:41.403
RETENTION ELECTION ON THE

01:15:41.470 --> 01:15:42.771
BALLOT. SO WE'LL BE LOOKING

01:15:42.838 --> 01:15:45.040
AROUND THOSE NUMBERS TO SEE WHAT

01:15:45.107 --> 01:15:46.141
WORKS BEST FOR THE STATE OF

01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:47.509
CALIFORNIA. I APPRECIATE THAT,

01:15:47.576 --> 01:15:49.044
AND THAT WAS A BIG CONCERN OF

01:15:49.111 --> 01:15:51.079
MINE. THE CONCERN THAT FOLLOWS

01:15:51.146 --> 01:15:52.981
IS JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE

01:15:53.048 --> 01:15:53.982
WONDERFULLY REASONABLE AND

01:15:54.049 --> 01:15:55.150
PRAGMATIC PEOPLE HERE NOW DOWN

01:15:55.217 --> 01:15:57.185
THE LINE, THEY COULD CHANGE THAT

01:15:57.252 --> 01:15:58.787
LEGISLATIVELY TO HIRE THAT

01:15:58.854 --> 01:16:00.088
THRESHOLD. AND THAT'S A CONCERN

01:16:00.155 --> 01:16:02.557
THAT I HAVE THAT THEN WHAT IF WE

01:16:02.624 --> 01:16:03.926
RAISED IT TO 2 MILLION OR 3

01:16:03.992 --> 01:16:04.526
MILLION SIGNATURES, MAKING IT

01:16:04.593 --> 01:16:05.961
NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE? SO FOR THOSE

01:16:06.028 --> 01:16:07.429
REASONS, I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO

01:16:07.496 --> 01:16:09.464
SUPPORT TODAY. BUT I APPRECIATE

01:16:09.531 --> 01:16:10.265
YOUR DEDICATION TO LONG TERM

01:16:10.332 --> 01:16:11.733
MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:13.201
ACCOUNTABILITY IN OUR JUDGES, IN

01:16:13.268 --> 01:16:14.303
MAKING SURE THAT VOTERS DO HAVE

01:16:14.369 --> 01:16:15.537
THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN

01:16:15.604 --> 01:16:17.873
OUR PROCESS. SO WITH THAT, WE

01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:19.574
HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND.

01:16:19.641 --> 01:16:21.143
MADAM SECRETARY, I'M SORRY,

01:16:21.209 --> 01:16:23.211
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE? SO

01:16:23.278 --> 01:16:24.680
JUST, YOU KNOW, THANK THE

01:16:24.746 --> 01:16:27.049
WITNESSES FOR THEIR POINTS THAT

01:16:27.115 --> 01:16:29.017
THEY'VE MADE. I MEAN, THIS BILL

01:16:29.084 --> 01:16:31.453
IS DEMOCRACY. IT ENFRANCHISES

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.355
VOTERS BY ALLOWING THEM TO

01:16:33.422 --> 01:16:35.324
DECIDE WHETHER JUDICIAL

01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:36.491
RETENTION ELECTIONS SHOULD

01:16:36.558 --> 01:16:38.293
REMAIN ON THE BALLOT. AND THEN

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:40.195
IF THE IF THIS DOES GET PASSED

01:16:40.262 --> 01:16:43.031
BY THE VOTERS, THEN IF THEY

01:16:43.098 --> 01:16:44.599
DECIDE THEY WANT THAT JUDGE TO

01:16:44.666 --> 01:16:46.568
APPEAR ON THE BALLOT, THERE WILL

01:16:46.635 --> 01:16:47.169
BE A SIMPLE PROCESS THAT THEY

01:16:47.235 --> 01:16:49.604
CAN PETITION TO PUT THE OFFICE

01:16:49.671 --> 01:16:50.973
ON THE BALLOT. SO WE DO WANT TO

01:16:51.039 --> 01:16:53.075
SUPPORT AN INDEPENDENT, UNBIASED

01:16:53.141 --> 01:16:54.543
JUDICIARY THAT IS NOT

01:16:54.609 --> 01:16:56.078
POLITICIZED. AND THIS MEASURE

01:16:56.144 --> 01:16:57.412
WORKS TOWARD THAT GOAL. SO I

01:16:57.479 --> 01:16:59.648
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

01:16:59.715 --> 01:17:00.649
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MADAM

01:17:00.716 --> 01:17:01.950
SECRETARY. WOULD YOU CALL THE

01:17:02.017 --> 01:17:04.419
ROLL ON AC EIGHT BY PELLERIN?

01:17:04.486 --> 01:17:06.421
THE MOTION IS DO PASS AND BE

01:17:06.488 --> 01:17:08.090
REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON

01:17:08.156 --> 01:17:09.925
APPROPRIATIONS. PELLERIN I,

01:17:09.992 --> 01:17:13.862
PELLERIN I MACEDO. MACEDO NÃ

01:17:13.929 --> 01:17:19.434
BENNETT. BENNETT I BURMAN. I

01:17:19.501 --> 01:17:26.575
STEFANI. WE'LL PUT THAT ON CALL.

01:17:26.641 --> 01:17:28.010
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU

01:17:28.076 --> 01:17:29.911
SO MUCH. ALL RIGHT. WE'RE STILL

01:17:29.978 --> 01:17:31.179
LOOKING FOR SENATORS. OKAY. OH,

01:17:31.246 --> 01:17:33.281
WAIT. WE GOT ONE. OH, YAY! I

01:17:33.348 --> 01:17:37.819
JUST SAW YOU ON TV. I JUST. OH,

01:17:37.886 --> 01:17:40.956
EXCELLENT. OKAY, I'M BACK ON TV.

01:17:41.023 --> 01:17:43.825
OKAY, GOOD, GOOD. GOOD TIME.

01:17:43.892 --> 01:17:44.559
YES, YES, I'VE BEEN RACING

01:17:44.626 --> 01:17:48.230
AROUND THE BUILDING. WELL THANK

01:17:48.296 --> 01:17:51.833
YOU. MEMBERS, LET ME START BY

01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:54.603
ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS AS

01:17:54.669 --> 01:17:55.804
OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS. SO

01:17:55.871 --> 01:17:57.539
JUST FOR THE RECORD, THIS IS

01:17:57.606 --> 01:18:00.075
ITEM NUMBER FIVE SB 760 BY

01:18:00.142 --> 01:18:01.076
SENATOR ALLEN. THAT'S CORRECT.

01:18:01.143 --> 01:18:04.012
YEAH. ALL RIGHT. SO I'M

01:18:04.079 --> 01:18:06.515
ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS. SO

01:18:06.581 --> 01:18:08.183
WHAT BRINGS US TO THIS ISSUE.

01:18:08.250 --> 01:18:09.584
ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE ALLOWED TO

01:18:09.651 --> 01:18:10.919
SOLICIT CONTRIBUTIONS ON BEHALF

01:18:10.986 --> 01:18:13.355
OF NONPROFIT TO ENCOURAGE

01:18:13.422 --> 01:18:15.223
CHARITABLE GIVING AND SUPPORTING

01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:16.091
CAUSES THAT BENEFIT OUR

01:18:16.158 --> 01:18:18.393
COMMUNITIES. THE OFFICIAL HAS TO

01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:19.494
REPORT ANY CONTRIBUTIONS THAT

01:18:19.561 --> 01:18:21.630
EXCEED $5,000 IN A CALENDAR

01:18:21.696 --> 01:18:24.866
YEAR. NOW, THIS IS THIS IS THE

01:18:24.933 --> 01:18:26.268
REASON WHY WE HAVE THAT KIND OF

01:18:26.334 --> 01:18:28.470
RULE, IS SO AS TO ALLOW FOR A

01:18:28.537 --> 01:18:29.905
BETTER UNDERSTANDING IN THE

01:18:29.971 --> 01:18:32.174
PUBLIC OF POTENTIAL INFLUENCE OF

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:34.309
A DONOR, OF A DONOR WITH AN

01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:40.315
ELECTED OFFICIAL. AND, YOU KNOW,

01:18:40.382 --> 01:18:41.783
ALSO, IF THERE'S ANY KIND OF

01:18:41.850 --> 01:18:43.952
CONNECTION BETWEEN THE NONPROFIT

01:18:44.019 --> 01:18:48.824
AND. THE ELECTED OFFICIAL. IT'S

01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:50.292
IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND

01:18:50.358 --> 01:18:51.893
THE POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:55.063
INTEREST THERE, TOO. NOW, THE

01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:56.898
CHALLENGE THAT BRINGS ME TO THIS

01:18:56.965 --> 01:18:57.732
STORY IS THAT THE STRINGENT

01:18:57.799 --> 01:18:58.366
REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY

01:18:58.433 --> 01:19:00.001
IN PLACE MAKE COMPLIANCE

01:19:00.068 --> 01:19:00.902
DIFFICULT IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES,

01:19:00.969 --> 01:19:03.338
AND, I FEAR, DISINCENTIVIZE

01:19:03.405 --> 01:19:05.607
PROSOCIAL BEHAVIOR BY ELECTED

01:19:05.674 --> 01:19:07.209
OFFICIALS. SO I'LL JUST GIVE YOU

01:19:07.275 --> 01:19:09.544
AN EXAMPLE OF HOW WHY THIS CAME

01:19:09.611 --> 01:19:11.246
ONTO MY RADAR SCREEN AFTER THE

01:19:11.313 --> 01:19:12.514
RECENT TERRIBLE FIRES IN MY

01:19:12.581 --> 01:19:15.250
DISTRICT. CHARITIES ACTIVATED TO

01:19:15.317 --> 01:19:16.585
PROVIDE IMMEDIATE AID AND LONG

01:19:16.651 --> 01:19:18.386
TERM RECOVERY SUPPORT TO THE

01:19:18.453 --> 01:19:21.690
VICTIMS. I WAS OUT EVERY DAY FOR

01:19:21.756 --> 01:19:24.659
WEEKS, YOU KNOW, VISITING SITES

01:19:24.726 --> 01:19:26.161
AND WAS WAS QUITE FRANKLY,

01:19:26.228 --> 01:19:27.295
REALLY IMPRESSED WITH THE WORK

01:19:27.362 --> 01:19:28.597
OF A LOT OF CHARITIES,

01:19:28.663 --> 01:19:30.298
ESPECIALLY THE RED CROSS AND

01:19:30.365 --> 01:19:31.299
OTHERS. I DON'T HAVE ANY

01:19:31.366 --> 01:19:32.267
PERSONAL CONNECTION TO THE RED

01:19:32.334 --> 01:19:33.902
CROSS, BUT I WAS JUST REALLY

01:19:33.969 --> 01:19:35.170
IMPRESSED WITH THE WORK THAT

01:19:35.237 --> 01:19:36.505
THEY DID IMMEDIATELY ON THE

01:19:36.571 --> 01:19:38.006
GROUND, PROVIDING SERVICES FOR

01:19:38.073 --> 01:19:39.207
MY CONSTITUENTS THAT WERE FACING

01:19:39.274 --> 01:19:41.743
THESE TERRIBLE FIRES. BUT THE

01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:45.480
CHALLENGE IS THAT I WAS WARNED

01:19:45.547 --> 01:19:47.282
THAT I HAD TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT,

01:19:47.349 --> 01:19:48.750
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE ONE THING THAT

01:19:48.817 --> 01:19:50.318
WAS CONSTANTLY BEING ASKED ON

01:19:50.385 --> 01:19:51.620
THE ON THE PRESS WAS, HEY, YOU

01:19:51.686 --> 01:19:53.355
KNOW, BOTH OF THE PRESS AND AT

01:19:53.421 --> 01:19:55.257
PUBLIC EVENTS AND ALL THE THINGS

01:19:55.323 --> 01:19:56.958
THAT WE WERE DOING, A LOT OF YOU

01:19:57.025 --> 01:19:58.059
HAVE GONE THROUGH THESE

01:19:58.126 --> 01:19:59.094
DISASTERS. EVERYONE ALWAYS WANTS

01:19:59.161 --> 01:20:00.495
TO ASK, WELL, HOW CAN PEOPLE

01:20:00.562 --> 01:20:01.930
HELP? AND I THINK THE MOST

01:20:01.997 --> 01:20:03.732
OBVIOUS WAY TO HELP, QUITE

01:20:03.798 --> 01:20:04.299
FRANKLY, WAS TO SUPPORT THE

01:20:04.366 --> 01:20:06.301
EFFORTS OF THE RED CROSS AND

01:20:06.368 --> 01:20:07.869
OTHER ORGANIZATIONS. BUT THE

01:20:07.936 --> 01:20:10.005
CHALLENGE IS THE LAWYERS, YOU

01:20:10.071 --> 01:20:11.840
KNOW, AND I'M ONE, I LOVE

01:20:11.907 --> 01:20:13.909
LAWYERS, BUT, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE

01:20:13.975 --> 01:20:15.544
OF THE LAW WOULD SAY TO US,

01:20:15.610 --> 01:20:17.245
LOOK, BE REAL CAREFUL BEFORE

01:20:17.312 --> 01:20:18.613
GOING OUT THERE SOLICITING

01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:20.849
DONATIONS FOR THESE WORTHY

01:20:20.916 --> 01:20:22.584
CHARITIES, BECAUSE A

01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:23.318
CONTRIBUTION IS CONSIDERED AT

01:20:23.385 --> 01:20:25.086
BEHEST, EVEN IF IT'S MADE AT A

01:20:25.153 --> 01:20:26.555
SIMPLE SUGGESTION OF ELECTED

01:20:26.621 --> 01:20:27.122
OFFICIAL, WITHOUT ANY

01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:28.957
COORDINATION WITH THE POTENTIAL

01:20:29.024 --> 01:20:31.226
CONTRIBUTOR. SO IF AN ELECTED

01:20:31.293 --> 01:20:32.227
OFFICIAL WERE TO MAKE A COMMENT

01:20:32.294 --> 01:20:34.062
ON SOCIAL MEDIA OR DURING A

01:20:34.129 --> 01:20:34.663
TELEVISION BROADCAST APPEALING

01:20:34.729 --> 01:20:36.431
TO THE PUBLIC TO CONSIDER

01:20:36.498 --> 01:20:37.032
SUPPORTING NONPROFITS THAT'S

01:20:37.098 --> 01:20:38.733
AIDING WILDFIRE VICTIMS, ANY

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:39.734
CONTRIBUTION COULD BE CONSIDERED

01:20:39.801 --> 01:20:41.670
A BEHEST. AND THIS IS TRUE EVEN

01:20:41.736 --> 01:20:43.271
IF THE ELECTED OFFICIAL DOESN'T

01:20:43.338 --> 01:20:45.207
KNOW IF A CONTRIBUTION WAS MADE

01:20:45.273 --> 01:20:46.408
AS A RESULT OF THAT PUBLIC

01:20:46.474 --> 01:20:47.742
APPEAL, DOESN'T KNOW IF A

01:20:47.809 --> 01:20:48.376
CONTRIBUTION EXCEEDS THE

01:20:48.443 --> 01:20:49.911
THRESHOLD, OR DIDN'T COORDINATE

01:20:49.978 --> 01:20:50.912
DIRECTLY WITH ANY OF THE

01:20:50.979 --> 01:20:52.047
POTENTIAL VIEWERS OF THAT

01:20:52.113 --> 01:20:53.448
COMMUNICATION. SIMILARLY, THE

01:20:53.515 --> 01:20:54.616
ORGANIZATION RECEIVING THE

01:20:54.683 --> 01:20:55.951
DONATION IS UNLIKELY TO HAVE ANY

01:20:56.017 --> 01:20:57.819
WAY OF KNOWING A CONTRIBUTION

01:20:57.886 --> 01:20:58.420
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WAS

01:20:58.486 --> 01:21:00.288
MADE DUE TO A PUBLIC APPEAL FROM

01:21:00.355 --> 01:21:01.256
A PARTICULAR ELECTED OFFICIAL.

01:21:01.323 --> 01:21:03.191
AND LET ME JUST SAY, JUST

01:21:03.258 --> 01:21:04.993
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT LIKELY TO

01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:07.195
GET PROSECUTED AT THE FEC

01:21:07.262 --> 01:21:08.964
DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULDN'T CHANGE

01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:11.566
THE RULES TO MAKE THEM MORE

01:21:11.633 --> 01:21:13.368
COMPLIANT WITH PROSOCIAL

01:21:13.435 --> 01:21:15.837
BEHAVIOR. YOU KNOW, I HATE IT

01:21:15.904 --> 01:21:17.339
WHEN, WHEN, WHEN PEOPLE SAY, OH,

01:21:17.405 --> 01:21:19.307
NO ONE'S GOING TO GO AFTER YOU

01:21:19.374 --> 01:21:20.375
FOR THAT. WELL, THAT THAT FEELS

01:21:20.442 --> 01:21:21.977
DISSATISFYING. I THINK WE SHOULD

01:21:22.043 --> 01:21:24.379
WE SHOULD CONFORM THE LAW BETTER

01:21:24.446 --> 01:21:27.649
TO HOW IT OUGHT TO BE. SO. AND

01:21:27.716 --> 01:21:29.317
WE ALSO DON'T WANT A SITUATION

01:21:29.384 --> 01:21:31.219
WHERE, WHERE SOME OF THE MORE

01:21:31.286 --> 01:21:35.590
CAUTIOUS AMONG US ARE FEELING.

01:21:35.657 --> 01:21:38.093
YOU KNOW, FEELING NERVOUS ABOUT

01:21:38.159 --> 01:21:40.495
ABOUT SAYING, HEY, GO GIVE MONEY

01:21:40.562 --> 01:21:42.063
TO THE RED CROSS. NOW, I WILL

01:21:42.130 --> 01:21:43.865
SAY, IF YOUR HUSBAND OR WIFE

01:21:43.932 --> 01:21:46.134
WORKS FOR THE RED CROSS OR YOUR

01:21:46.201 --> 01:21:48.236
CHIEF OF STAFF WORKS FOR THE ON

01:21:48.303 --> 01:21:49.504
THE BOARD OF THE RED CROSS, THAT

01:21:49.571 --> 01:21:50.639
FEELS A LITTLE DIFFERENT IN

01:21:50.705 --> 01:21:52.307
TERMS OF WITHDRAWING REPORTING

01:21:52.374 --> 01:21:52.874
REQUIREMENTS. SO WE WORKED

01:21:52.941 --> 01:21:54.409
REALLY CLOSELY WITH THE

01:21:54.476 --> 01:21:55.343
CALIFORNIA CLEAN MONEY CAMPAIGN,

01:21:55.410 --> 01:21:57.679
COMMON CAUSE, SOME OTHER GOOD

01:21:57.746 --> 01:21:58.813
GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS, LEAGUE

01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:00.615
OF WOMEN VOTERS AND OTHERS TO

01:22:00.682 --> 01:22:02.584
MAKE SURE THAT THEIR THEIR

01:22:02.651 --> 01:22:04.686
RETAINED. WE RETAIN CRITICAL

01:22:04.753 --> 01:22:06.321
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR THOSE

01:22:06.388 --> 01:22:09.591
KINDS OF CONNECTIONS. SO LET ME

01:22:09.658 --> 01:22:11.259
THANK YOU KNOW, MY GOOD FRIEND

01:22:11.326 --> 01:22:13.395

COMMITTEE STAFF, COMMON CAUSE

01:22:14.763 --> 01:22:16.364
AND OTHERS FOR WORKING

01:22:16.431 --> 01:22:17.065
COLLABORATIVELY ON IMPORTANT

01:22:17.132 --> 01:22:17.766
AMENDMENTS THAT IMPROVE

01:22:17.832 --> 01:22:18.900
TRANSPARENCY SO THE PUBLIC WILL

01:22:18.967 --> 01:22:20.335
KNOW IF ELECTED OFFICIALS OR

01:22:20.402 --> 01:22:21.736
THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS OR STAFF

01:22:21.803 --> 01:22:23.071
WILL HAVE ANY CONNECTIONS TO THE

01:22:23.138 --> 01:22:24.639
NONPROFIT. I PUT THOSE KIND OF

01:22:24.706 --> 01:22:25.874
SITUATIONS IN A SEPARATE

01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:27.375
CATEGORY. WITH THAT, I

01:22:27.442 --> 01:22:28.209
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE,

01:22:28.276 --> 01:22:30.912
AND I INVITE OUR WITNESS, TRENT

01:22:30.979 --> 01:22:32.314
LÂ®NG, TO SPEAK ON THE ON THE

01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:34.316
MATTER. ABSOLUTELY. YOU HAVE TWO

01:22:34.382 --> 01:22:37.452
MINUTES. THANK YOU. TRENT LÂ®NG,

01:22:37.519 --> 01:22:38.420
PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:22:38.486 --> 01:22:40.488
CLEAN MONEY CAMPAIGN. VERY

01:22:40.555 --> 01:22:42.957
PLEASED TO SUPPORT SB 760 AS AS

01:22:43.024 --> 01:22:45.794
AMENDED BY SENATOR ALLEN AND THE

01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:46.795
COMMITTEE'S GREAT

01:22:46.861 --> 01:22:48.029
RECOMMENDATIONS. VERY GRATEFUL

01:22:48.096 --> 01:22:49.397
TO BOTH SENATOR ALLEN AND THE

01:22:49.464 --> 01:22:52.000
COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US ON

01:22:52.067 --> 01:22:54.169
AND OTHERS ON THE DETAILS.

01:22:54.235 --> 01:22:55.036
BEHESTED PAYMENT REPORTING IS A

01:22:55.103 --> 01:22:57.372
VITAL TRANSPARENCY TOOL BECAUSE

01:22:57.439 --> 01:22:59.207
IT SHINES LIGHT ON WHEN ELECTED

01:22:59.274 --> 01:23:01.643
OFFICIALS ASK DONORS TO SUPPORT

01:23:01.710 --> 01:23:03.445
ORGANIZATIONS THAT THERE'S SOME

01:23:03.511 --> 01:23:05.413
THAT IN SOME CASES, THEY'RE

01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:07.315
CONNECTED TO. THIS HELPS ENSURE

01:23:07.382 --> 01:23:10.518
PUBLIC TRUST AND ACCOUNTABILITY.

01:23:10.585 --> 01:23:12.620
BUT SB 760 ADDRESSES THE REAL

01:23:12.687 --> 01:23:14.656
AND REASONABLE CONCERN THAT THAT

01:23:14.723 --> 01:23:18.493
SENATOR ALLEN VERY CAPABLY

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:19.461
DEMONSTRATED THAT WE DON'T WANT

01:23:19.527 --> 01:23:20.962
ELECTED OFFICIALS TO BE

01:23:21.029 --> 01:23:22.697
DISCOURAGED FROM ASKING

01:23:22.764 --> 01:23:24.532
PUBLICLY, ENCOURAGING DONATIONS

01:23:24.599 --> 01:23:26.768
TO WORTHY CHARITIES, ESPECIALLY

01:23:26.835 --> 01:23:29.037
DURING AND AFTER DISASTERS, FOR

01:23:29.104 --> 01:23:30.905
THE FEAR OF TRIGGERING COMPLEX

01:23:30.972 --> 01:23:32.507
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THAT MAY

01:23:32.574 --> 01:23:35.310
BE HARD TO ACTUALLY FULFILL.

01:23:35.377 --> 01:23:36.478
THAT'S NOT THE OUTCOME THAT ANY

01:23:36.544 --> 01:23:39.080
OF US WANT. THANKS TO SENATOR

01:23:39.147 --> 01:23:39.681
ALLEN'S THOUGHTFUL AMENDMENTS,

01:23:39.748 --> 01:23:42.584
SB 760 NOW EXEMPTS EXEMPTS ONLY

01:23:42.650 --> 01:23:43.885
GOOD FAITH PUBLIC APPEALS, SUCH

01:23:43.952 --> 01:23:45.787
AS THOSE MADE THROUGH TV, RADIO,

01:23:45.854 --> 01:23:47.655
SOCIAL MEDIA, OR PUBLIC

01:23:47.722 --> 01:23:49.090
SPEECHES, WHILE PRESERVING

01:23:49.157 --> 01:23:50.258
SAFEGUARDS AGAINST ABUSE THAT

01:23:50.325 --> 01:23:52.727
ARE IN CURRENT LAW AS TO BE

01:23:52.794 --> 01:23:54.863
AMENDED. IT WILL EXEMPT PUBLIC

01:23:54.929 --> 01:23:55.997
SPEECHES SUCH AS THOSE GIVEN IN

01:23:56.064 --> 01:23:58.466
FRONT OF CITY HALL, BUT WILL NOT

01:23:58.533 --> 01:23:59.834
EXEMPT FUNDRAISERS WHERE AN

01:23:59.901 --> 01:24:02.203
OFFICIAL IS FEATURED IN A

01:24:02.270 --> 01:24:03.505
SOLICITATION OR DIRECTLY ASKED

01:24:03.571 --> 01:24:05.640
THE CROWD AT THE FUNDRAISER TO

01:24:05.707 --> 01:24:07.509
DONATE TO THAT SPECIFIC

01:24:07.575 --> 01:24:10.044
ORGANIZATION. AT THE FUNDRAISER,

01:24:10.111 --> 01:24:11.279
AS YOU MENTIONED, THE AMENDMENTS

01:24:11.346 --> 01:24:12.580
WILL ALSO ENSURE THAT BEHESTED

01:24:12.647 --> 01:24:13.748
PAYMENT REPORTS ARE STILL

01:24:13.815 --> 01:24:14.682
REQUIRED WHEN AN ELECTED

01:24:14.749 --> 01:24:16.084
OFFICIAL KNOWS THAT THEY, A

01:24:16.151 --> 01:24:17.852
MEMBER OF THEIR IMMEDIATE FAMILY

01:24:17.919 --> 01:24:19.053
OR THEIR CAMPAIGN OR

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:20.422
OFFICEHOLDER STAFF HAS A DEFINED

01:24:20.488 --> 01:24:22.590
CONFLICT OF INTEREST, SUCH AS

01:24:22.657 --> 01:24:24.025
DECISION MAKING AUTHORITY,

01:24:24.092 --> 01:24:25.794
GETTING PAID A SALARY OR

01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:28.163
FOUNDING MEMBER STATUS. WITH

01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:30.165
THESE AMENDMENTS, SB 760 WILL

01:24:30.231 --> 01:24:31.833
GIVE ELECTED OFFICIALS THE

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:33.034
FLEXIBILITY TO PURSUE THESE VERY

01:24:33.101 --> 01:24:34.436
IMPORTANT PUBLIC APPEALS WITHOUT

01:24:34.502 --> 01:24:35.970
HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING

01:24:36.037 --> 01:24:38.840
CAUGHT, WITHOUT OPENING ANY ANY

01:24:38.907 --> 01:24:40.241
LOOPHOLES IN THESE SORTS OF

01:24:40.308 --> 01:24:41.376
SITUATIONS. SO WE'RE VERY

01:24:41.443 --> 01:24:43.311
GRATEFUL TO SENATOR ALLEN FOR

01:24:43.378 --> 01:24:44.245

ANYBODY ELSE IN THE ROOM WHO

01:24:52.187 --> 01:24:54.522
WANTS TO JUST COME TO THE MIC

01:24:54.589 --> 01:24:56.991

TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING

01:25:15.977 --> 01:25:16.644
THIS. I WE HAD A LITTLE

01:25:16.711 --> 01:25:18.079
CONVERSATION WITH MY STAFF AT

01:25:18.146 --> 01:25:20.515
THE. I DON'T KNOW IF TIÂ¾N AND I

01:25:20.582 --> 01:25:21.850
ARE GOING TO JUST BECOME GOOD

01:25:21.916 --> 01:25:23.184
FRIENDS IN THE LEGISLATURE. YES,

01:25:23.251 --> 01:25:24.252

HE THAT HE'S DOING OBVIOUSLY HAS

01:25:25.954 --> 01:25:27.255
BEEN HAS BEEN DOING. BUT AS A

01:25:27.322 --> 01:25:29.090
NEW MEMBER, OBVIOUSLY WE'RE

01:25:29.157 --> 01:25:29.991
SEEING EYE ON A LOT OF THESE

01:25:30.058 --> 01:25:32.193
THINGS. I THINK YOU SAID IT

01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:33.094
BEST, SENATOR ALLEN. WE AS

01:25:33.161 --> 01:25:35.096
ELECTED OFFICIALS WERE OUT THERE

01:25:35.163 --> 01:25:36.097
DOING THE PEOPLE'S WORK. AND I

01:25:36.164 --> 01:25:36.664
REMEMBER THE COUNTLESS TIMES

01:25:36.731 --> 01:25:38.233
THAT I'VE DONE SOME REQUESTS AS

01:25:38.299 --> 01:25:39.634
A LOCAL MAYOR, OBVIOUSLY, WITH

01:25:39.701 --> 01:25:42.170
THE FIRES RECENTLY DURING THE

01:25:42.237 --> 01:25:44.272
PANDEMIC AND JUST ORGANICALLY

01:25:44.339 --> 01:25:45.507
SAYING, HEY, WE HAVE THIS

01:25:45.573 --> 01:25:46.441

PLEASE HELP, AND REALLY NOT EVEN

01:25:48.710 --> 01:25:49.410
BECAUSE I'M DOING IT, BUT

01:25:49.477 --> 01:25:50.778
BECAUSE THERE'S A LOCAL

01:25:50.845 --> 01:25:51.913
NONPROFIT, LITERALLY A NONPROFIT

01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:52.981
IN THE COMMUNITY. AND JUST, YOU

01:25:53.047 --> 01:25:54.616
KNOW, I USE A HASHTAG COMMUNITY

01:25:54.682 --> 01:25:56.518
EFFORT IN MY CITY WHERE WE ARE

01:25:56.584 --> 01:25:58.353
JUST KIND OF, YOU KNOW, GATHER

01:25:58.419 --> 01:26:00.088
AND SHOW OUR HUMANITY AND HELP

01:26:00.154 --> 01:26:03.124
OTHERS. BUT BY DOING SO, WE NEED

01:26:03.191 --> 01:26:04.225
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE OBVIOUSLY

01:26:04.292 --> 01:26:05.360
ARE FOLLOWING THE LAWS AND THAT,

01:26:05.426 --> 01:26:07.095
YOU KNOW, PROTECT US AS ELECTED

01:26:07.161 --> 01:26:08.429
OFFICIALS, OUR FAMILIES AND OUR

01:26:08.496 --> 01:26:09.831
STAFF, FOR THAT MATTER. AND SO,

01:26:09.898 --> 01:26:11.299
WITH THAT BEING SAID, I LIKE

01:26:11.366 --> 01:26:12.333
YOUR LEGISLATION. I THINK THAT

01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:14.235
IT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT

01:26:14.302 --> 01:26:15.670
DIRECTION. AND WITH THAT, I'D

01:26:15.737 --> 01:26:17.338
LIKE TO MOVE. AND IF POSSIBLE,

01:26:17.405 --> 01:26:18.039
I'D LIKE TO COAUTHOR THE

01:26:18.106 --> 01:26:19.007
LEGISLATION. THANK YOU, MADAM

01:26:19.073 --> 01:26:20.441
CHAIR. THANK YOU, ASSEMBLY

01:26:20.508 --> 01:26:22.210
MEMBER BENNETT. THANK YOU, MADAM

01:26:22.277 --> 01:26:25.046
CHAIR. I APPLAUD THE AUTHOR, THE

01:26:25.113 --> 01:26:26.514
ORGANIZATIONS AND COMMITTEE

01:26:26.581 --> 01:26:28.583
STAFF. YOU'VE MADE A GOOD CASE

01:26:28.650 --> 01:26:30.552
THAT WE NEED TO MAKE A CHANGE.

01:26:30.618 --> 01:26:32.387
WHENEVER YOU MAKE THESE KIND OF

01:26:32.453 --> 01:26:33.354
CHANGES, YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT

01:26:33.421 --> 01:26:34.789
WHETHER YOU'RE OPENING UP A

01:26:34.856 --> 01:26:37.659
LOOPHOLE. AND YOU, I THINK,

01:26:37.725 --> 01:26:39.827
BOLDLY SAID THIS DOESN'T OPEN UP

01:26:39.894 --> 01:26:41.596
ANY LOOPHOLES. I, I'M CAUTIOUSLY

01:26:41.663 --> 01:26:43.698
VOTING, SAYING I DON'T THINK

01:26:43.765 --> 01:26:45.567
IT'S OPENING UP ANY LOOPHOLES,

01:26:45.633 --> 01:26:48.469
BUT THE ABILITY OF THE MONEYED

01:26:48.536 --> 01:26:51.105
CLASS THAT WANTS TO ABUSE

01:26:51.172 --> 01:26:53.474
GETTING MONEY INTO POLITICS IS

01:26:53.541 --> 01:26:57.879
VERY CREATIVE. AND SO I APPLAUD

01:26:57.946 --> 01:27:00.715
YOU FOR IT. LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE

01:27:00.782 --> 01:27:01.983
LOOKED AT EVERYTHING YOU

01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:04.586
POSSIBLY CAN IN TERMS OF TRYING

01:27:04.652 --> 01:27:06.788
TO AFFECT THOSE LOOPHOLES, BUT I

01:27:06.854 --> 01:27:07.922
THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD

01:27:07.989 --> 01:27:11.159
PAY ATTENTION TO AS AS THIS GOES

01:27:11.225 --> 01:27:14.095
FORWARD, THE YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T

01:27:14.162 --> 01:27:16.497
HAD A LOT OF TIME WITH THE BILL

01:27:16.564 --> 01:27:19.033
JUST YESTERDAY AND THIS MORNING,

01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:22.203
AND THE ONE THOUGHT WAS PERHAPS

01:27:22.270 --> 01:27:25.106
IN THE FUTURE, LOOKING AT WHAT

01:27:25.173 --> 01:27:26.474
TYPES OF ORGANIZATIONS, I MEAN,

01:27:26.541 --> 01:27:28.543
YOU MAKE IT REAL CLEAR, THE RED

01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:29.978
CROSS AND THOSE KINDS OF

01:27:30.044 --> 01:27:31.312
ORGANIZATIONS THAT NEVER MAKE

01:27:31.379 --> 01:27:33.147
POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS. BUT

01:27:33.214 --> 01:27:34.515
PERHAPS THERE'S SOMETHING

01:27:34.582 --> 01:27:36.751
DIFFERENT FOR ORGANIZATIONS THAT

01:27:36.818 --> 01:27:40.822
GET VERY INVOLVED IN POLITICS

01:27:40.888 --> 01:27:44.292
OFTENTIMES. AND YEAH, I COULD I

01:27:44.359 --> 01:27:46.561
COULD THINK OF THOSE. AND, AND

01:27:46.628 --> 01:27:49.631
THEN IF, IF SOMEBODY YOU KNOW SO

01:27:49.697 --> 01:27:52.834

01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:53.935

SPECIFIC NEXT STEP. BUT IT IS IT

01:27:56.838 --> 01:27:58.306
IS ALWAYS A CHALLENGE. I MEAN

01:27:58.373 --> 01:27:59.974
THE IDEAL SITUATION IN THE WORLD

01:28:00.041 --> 01:28:01.809
WOULD BE, LET'S JUST GIVE THE

01:28:01.876 --> 01:28:03.211
FPPC THE AUTHORITY TO DO WHAT

01:28:03.277 --> 01:28:05.813
MAKES COMMON SENSE. BUT WE CAN'T

01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:07.615
WRITE LEGISLATION THAT WAY. BUT

01:28:07.682 --> 01:28:09.550
THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO

01:28:09.617 --> 01:28:10.518
DO. NOBODY WOULD EVER GET

01:28:10.585 --> 01:28:12.286
PROSECUTED FOR MAKING AN APPEAL

01:28:12.353 --> 01:28:13.655

THAT COUNTY? THE ELECTORATE CAN

01:41:21.575 --> 01:41:23.944
VOTE YES OR THEY CAN VOTE NO.

01:41:24.011 --> 01:41:24.545
IT'S NOT A NEW CONCEPT. YOU'RE

01:41:24.611 --> 01:41:26.880
ALL HERE TODAY AS A RESULT OF

01:41:26.947 --> 01:41:27.748
THIS TRUST. THIS PROCESS IS

01:41:27.815 --> 01:41:30.050
CALLED DEMOCRACY. OPPONENTS OF

01:41:30.117 --> 01:41:32.553
512 SOMETIMES CALL IT STRATEGIC

01:41:32.619 --> 01:41:33.887
MANIPULATION. UNFORTUNATELY, THE

01:41:33.954 --> 01:41:35.489
SUPREME COURT HAS GIVEN YOU

01:41:35.556 --> 01:41:37.291
DIRECTION IN THIS MEASURE. IN

01:41:37.357 --> 01:41:38.692
2017, CALIFORNIA CANNABIS

01:41:38.759 --> 01:41:40.160
COALITION VERSUS THE CITY OF

01:41:40.227 --> 01:41:41.628
UPLAND, THE COURT DEFINITIVELY

01:41:41.695 --> 01:41:42.563
ESTABLISHED THE CITIZENS

01:41:42.629 --> 01:41:43.931
INITIATIVES ARE NOT BOUND BY THE

01:41:43.997 --> 01:41:44.965
PROCEDURAL CONSTRAINTS THAT

01:41:45.032 --> 01:41:47.334
APPLY TO GOVERNMENT INITIATED

01:41:47.401 --> 01:41:48.569
MEASURES. THE COURT EMPHASIZED

01:41:48.635 --> 01:41:49.937
THE PRIMACY OF INITIATIVE POWER

01:41:50.003 --> 01:41:51.071
IN CALIFORNIA, NOTING THAT IT

01:41:51.138 --> 01:41:52.473
SHOULD BE CONSTRUED LIBERALLY IN

01:41:52.539 --> 01:41:54.174
FAVOR OF THE PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO

01:41:54.241 --> 01:41:55.909
PROPOSE AND ENACT LAWS. WHILE

01:41:55.976 --> 01:41:57.511
THE RULING CENTERED ON ELECTION

01:41:57.578 --> 01:41:59.012
TIMING, IT HAS BEEN WIDELY

01:41:59.079 --> 01:41:59.913
INTERPRETED, ALONG WITH

01:41:59.980 --> 01:42:00.914
SUBSEQUENT LOWER COURT

01:42:00.981 --> 01:42:02.449
DECISIONS, AS ALLOWING SPECIAL

01:42:02.516 --> 01:42:03.951
TAXES PROPOSED BY CITIZENS TO

01:42:04.017 --> 01:42:05.953
PASS BY SIMPLE MAJORITY.

01:42:06.019 --> 01:42:08.255
OPPONENTS OF 512 WILL ARGUE THAT

01:42:08.322 --> 01:42:09.289
THE TWO THIRDS VOTE REQUIREMENT

01:42:09.356 --> 01:42:10.724
FOR SPECIAL TAXES STILL APPLIES,

01:42:10.791 --> 01:42:12.192
REGARDLESS OF WHO PLACES THE

01:42:12.259 --> 01:42:13.393
MEASURE ON THE BALLOT. HOWEVER,

01:42:13.460 --> 01:42:15.062
THE UPLAND DECISION DRAWS A

01:42:15.128 --> 01:42:16.430
CRITICAL LEGAL DISTINCTION

01:42:16.497 --> 01:42:17.865
BETWEEN TAXES PROPOSED BY LOCAL

01:42:17.931 --> 01:42:18.966
GOVERNMENTS, WHICH ARE SUBJECT

01:42:19.032 --> 01:42:20.834
TO MUCH STRICTER PROCEDURAL AND

01:42:20.901 --> 01:42:22.269
SUBSTANTIVE REQUIREMENTS UNDER

01:42:22.336 --> 01:42:25.105
213, 218, AND PROPOSITION 13, AS

01:42:25.172 --> 01:42:26.607
THOSE PROPOSED BY VOTER

01:42:26.673 --> 01:42:28.642
INITIATIVE. ALL THAT BEING SAID

01:42:28.709 --> 01:42:31.111
AGAIN, SB 512 IS NOT SEEKING ANY

01:42:31.178 --> 01:42:33.714
NEW TAXING AUTHORITY. SB 512

01:42:33.780 --> 01:42:35.883
SEEKS TO ENSURE THAT IF A

01:42:35.949 --> 01:42:36.884
CITIZENS INITIATIVE IS PROPOSED

01:42:36.950 --> 01:42:39.453
AND THEN ALSO SUPPORTED BY A

01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:41.688
MAJORITY OF THE ELECTORATE, THAT

01:42:41.755 --> 01:42:43.056
TAXPAYER PROTECTIONS WOULD BE

01:42:43.123 --> 01:42:44.525
APPLIED TO THOSE RESOURCES SO

01:42:44.591 --> 01:42:46.727
THAT THEY ARE ENSURED TO BE IN

01:42:46.793 --> 01:42:49.530
GOOD, GOOD CARE. SB 512

01:42:49.596 --> 01:42:51.098
REINFORCES THE FOUNDATIONAL

01:42:51.164 --> 01:42:52.032
DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE THAT

01:42:52.099 --> 01:42:53.667
GOVERNMENT WORKS BEST WHEN IT'S

01:42:53.734 --> 01:42:56.136
TRUSTED CITIZENS ARE ENABLED TO

01:42:56.203 --> 01:42:57.137
MAKE DECISIONS FOR THEIR

01:42:57.204 --> 01:42:58.272
COLLECTIVE FUTURE, AND ENSURES

01:42:58.338 --> 01:43:00.440
THAT THOSE RESOURCES ARE USED

01:43:00.507 --> 01:43:02.175
FOR WHAT THE CITIZENS HAVE

01:43:02.242 --> 01:43:03.944
INTENDED. SB 512 IS A

AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE THOSE TAXES.

01:46:06.626 --> 01:46:08.161
