PRESENTING SB 756, WHICH

STRENGTHENS CALIFORNIA'S

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:07.752
INVESTMENT IN FILM AND

00:38:07.818 --> 00:38:09.520
TELEVISION BY IMPROVING HOW WE

00:38:09.587 --> 00:38:12.757
MEASURE WHO BENEFITS FROM THE

00:38:12.823 --> 00:38:14.558
330 MILLION ANNUAL FILM TAX

00:38:14.625 --> 00:38:16.027
CREDIT, ENSURING THAT THOSE

00:38:16.093 --> 00:38:18.062

00:38:18.129 --> 00:38:19.630
THIS BILL BUILDS ON BROADER

00:38:19.697 --> 00:38:21.465
EFFORTS THIS YEAR TO IMPROVE THE

00:38:21.532 --> 00:38:24.268
PROGRAMS ACCOUNTABILITY. SB 756

00:38:24.335 --> 00:38:25.703
ADDS A CRITICAL LAYER OF

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:27.204
FOCUSING ON EQUITY AND

00:38:27.271 --> 00:38:28.272
TRANSPARENCY SO THAT WE

00:38:28.339 --> 00:38:30.741
UNDERSTAND NOT JUST HOW MUCH WE

00:38:30.808 --> 00:38:32.910
INVEST, BUT WHO TRULY BENEFITS.

00:38:32.977 --> 00:38:34.745
AS A SENATOR REPRESENTING SOUTH

00:38:34.812 --> 00:38:36.781
LA, I OFTEN SEE PRODUCTIONS IN

00:38:36.847 --> 00:38:39.016
MY DISTRICT COMMUNITIES LIKE

00:38:39.083 --> 00:38:41.886
BALDWIN HILLS, LEIMERT PARK,

00:38:41.952 --> 00:38:44.455
PARTS OF HISTORIC SOUTH LA. YET

00:38:44.522 --> 00:38:46.390
MANY RESIDENTS RARELY HAVE

00:38:46.457 --> 00:38:48.426
ACCESS TO THESE GOOD UNION JOBS

00:38:48.492 --> 00:38:50.161
AND THE PRODUCTIONS THAT OUR TAX

00:38:50.227 --> 00:38:52.596
DOLLARS CREATE. THIS IS A MISSED

00:38:52.663 --> 00:38:53.798
OPPORTUNITY, A MISSED

00:38:53.864 --> 00:38:55.866
OPPORTUNITY TO MULTIPLY OUR

00:38:55.933 --> 00:38:57.668
INVESTMENTS. WE COULD DO MORE TO

00:38:57.735 --> 00:38:59.236
IMPROVE HOW WE TRACK WHERE THESE

00:38:59.303 --> 00:39:00.971
PROJECTS ARE HAPPENING, WHO'S

00:39:01.038 --> 00:39:02.907
WORKING ON THEM, AND HOW TO

00:39:02.973 --> 00:39:04.575
ENSURE AN INCLUSIVE WORKFORCE.

00:39:04.642 --> 00:39:06.143
THAT IS, EVEN THOUGH WE EXPECT

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:07.712
THIS KIND OF INFORMATION AND

00:39:07.778 --> 00:39:09.580
OTHER SECTORS THAT RECEIVE

00:39:09.647 --> 00:39:11.849
PUBLIC FUNDING, WE REALIZE THAT

00:39:11.916 --> 00:39:13.350
IN THIS INDUSTRY, WE HAVE NOT

00:39:13.417 --> 00:39:15.753
BEEN ABLE TO TRACK AS CLOSELY.

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:18.022
SB 756 DIRECTS THE CALIFORNIA

00:39:18.089 --> 00:39:19.657
FILM COMMISSION TO EXPAND ITS

00:39:19.724 --> 00:39:21.459
EXISTING REPORTING AND DIVERSITY

00:39:21.525 --> 00:39:22.960
ASSESSMENT PRACTICES, SO THAT

00:39:23.027 --> 00:39:25.162
ALL DATA WOULD BE COLLECTED

00:39:25.229 --> 00:39:26.130
CONFIDENTIALLY THROUGH CERTIFIED

00:39:26.197 --> 00:39:28.132
PAYROLL AND THIRD PARTY SYSTEMS

00:39:28.199 --> 00:39:30.534
WITH NO NEW MANDATES. AS THE

00:39:30.601 --> 00:39:32.770
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST NOTED IN ITS

00:39:32.837 --> 00:39:34.672
2025 REPORT, BETTER DEMOGRAPHIC

00:39:34.739 --> 00:39:37.274
AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA IS ESSENTIAL

00:39:37.341 --> 00:39:39.143
TO EVALUATING PROGRAM IMPACT AND

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:40.945
EQUITY. AND QUITE FRANKLY, WE

00:39:41.011 --> 00:39:42.313
HAVE DONE SO MUCH WORK, MANY

00:39:42.379 --> 00:39:43.914
AROUND THIS TABLE, TO ENSURE

00:39:43.981 --> 00:39:46.150
THAT WE HAVE THE STRONGEST FILM

00:39:46.217 --> 00:39:48.052
AND TELEVISION TAX CREDIT

00:39:48.119 --> 00:39:50.354
PROGRAM. I THINK IN THE NATION,

00:39:50.421 --> 00:39:52.223
WE'RE FOCUSING ON WORK AND JOBS

00:39:52.289 --> 00:39:53.557
AS WELL AS SUSTAINING THE

00:39:53.624 --> 00:39:56.193
INDUSTRY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:57.394
WE ONLY KNOW OUR PROGRESS BY

00:39:57.461 --> 00:39:59.296
WHAT WE ARE ABLE TO TRACK AND

00:39:59.363 --> 00:40:01.098
SHOW IN TERMS OF WHERE WORKERS

00:40:01.165 --> 00:40:03.234
ARE WORKING, WHAT ZIP CODES

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:06.170
THEY'RE FROM, AND WHAT ARE SOME

00:40:06.237 --> 00:40:07.071
OF THE DISADVANTAGE STATUS THAT

00:40:07.138 --> 00:40:09.907
THEY MAY HOST HOLD. I THINK THAT

00:40:09.974 --> 00:40:11.308
HELPS US TO ENSURE THAT THIS

00:40:11.375 --> 00:40:12.710
INVESTMENT IS A MULTIPLIER FOR

00:40:12.777 --> 00:40:14.145
SO MANY COMMUNITIES. AND WITH

00:40:14.211 --> 00:40:15.813
THAT, I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.148
YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU. SENATOR.

00:40:17.214 --> 00:40:18.883
AT THIS TIME, I THINK WE WILL

00:40:18.949 --> 00:40:19.583
ESTABLISH QUORUM. MADAM

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:21.352

TO COMMITTEE COMMENTS AND BEGIN

00:41:07.531 --> 00:41:09.266
WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:41:09.333 --> 00:41:11.268
QUIRK-SILVA. GOOD MORNING

00:41:11.335 --> 00:41:15.539
SENATOR. YEAH, I DEFINITELY

00:41:15.606 --> 00:41:17.474
SUPPORT THIS BILL. DEFINITELY

00:41:17.541 --> 00:41:19.210
THINK WE NEED THIS DATA. AND AS

00:41:19.276 --> 00:41:21.111
YOU KNOW, THROUGH OUR BUDGET

00:41:21.178 --> 00:41:25.349
SUBCOMMITTEE, WE. HEARD QUITE A

00:41:25.416 --> 00:41:27.084
BIT ABOUT THE FILM TAX CREDIT.

00:41:27.151 --> 00:41:29.420
AND SO THIS DATA IS IMPORTANT. I

00:41:29.486 --> 00:41:31.322
DO HAVE A QUESTION ON THE

00:41:31.388 --> 00:41:32.389
COMMISSION. THE FILM COMMISSION

00:41:32.456 --> 00:41:35.492
AS A WHOLE, BECAUSE THIS HAS

00:41:35.559 --> 00:41:38.696
COME UP IN THE PAST, ACTUALLY

00:41:38.762 --> 00:41:43.367
PRETTY. VERY FOCUSED ON THE LACK

00:41:43.434 --> 00:41:45.603
OF DATA. AND THAT WAS ACTUALLY

00:41:45.669 --> 00:41:48.205
ABOUT 3 TO 4 YEARS AGO, WHERE

00:41:48.272 --> 00:41:50.941
THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF

00:41:51.008 --> 00:41:52.710
CONCERN OF WHY THIS WASN'T

00:41:52.776 --> 00:41:55.246
ALREADY HAPPENING. SO I GUESS,

00:41:55.312 --> 00:41:59.617
AND IT COULD BE FUTURE.

00:41:59.683 --> 00:42:02.086
INFORMATION. BUT WHAT IS THE

00:42:02.152 --> 00:42:03.487
MAKEUP OF THE FILM COMMISSION

00:42:03.554 --> 00:42:06.790
AND HOW ARE THEY APPOINTED? SO

00:42:06.857 --> 00:42:08.559
THE FILM COMMISSION, LIKE SO

00:42:08.626 --> 00:42:10.494
MANY OF OUR COMMISSIONS, ARE

00:42:10.561 --> 00:42:13.297
APPOINTED BY OUR GOVERNOR. AND

00:42:13.364 --> 00:42:15.499
BECAUSE OF OUR WORK, A LOT OF

00:42:15.566 --> 00:42:18.269
OUR WORK OVER THE LAST TWO AND A

00:42:18.335 --> 00:42:18.936
HALF YEARS, WE HAVE REALLY TRIED

00:42:19.003 --> 00:42:20.070
TO EXPAND THAT COMMISSION TO

00:42:20.137 --> 00:42:21.939
HAVE VITAL VOICES THAT REALLY

00:42:22.006 --> 00:42:23.741
REPRESENT CALIFORNIA. I THINK

00:42:23.807 --> 00:42:26.977
THE OTHER AREA WHERE WE SAW SOME

00:42:27.044 --> 00:42:28.679
DEFICITS IN THE COMMISSION WAS

00:42:28.746 --> 00:42:31.048
JUST STAFFING. WE'VE DONE A LOT

00:42:31.115 --> 00:42:32.049
OF LEGISLATION IN TERMS OF

00:42:32.116 --> 00:42:33.517
ENSURING THAT THERE ARE

00:42:33.584 --> 00:42:36.220
DIVERSITY REQUIREMENTS IN THE

00:42:36.287 --> 00:42:38.856
FILM STAGE DEVELOPMENT IN

00:42:38.923 --> 00:42:41.425
PARTICULAR, BUT IN GENERAL, IN

00:42:41.492 --> 00:42:43.093
ALL OF THE FILM AND DIVERSITY

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:44.595
TAX CREDITS, THE PROBLEM IS WE

00:42:44.662 --> 00:42:46.463
DIDN'T HAVE A UNIFORM STANDARD

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:48.632
FOR COLLECTING THAT DATA. SO ONE

00:42:48.699 --> 00:42:49.900
PROJECT MIGHT BE COLLECTING

00:42:49.967 --> 00:42:51.402
ORANGES, THE OTHER ONE IS

00:42:51.468 --> 00:42:51.969
COLLECTING POMEGRANATES, AND

00:42:52.036 --> 00:42:53.704
IT'S SORT OF HARD TO TELL

00:42:53.771 --> 00:42:54.939
EXACTLY WHAT WE HAVE. AND TO BE

00:42:55.005 --> 00:42:57.474
ABLE TO AGGREGATE THE DATA TO

00:42:57.541 --> 00:43:00.010
TELL US A FULL STORY. AND WE

00:43:00.077 --> 00:43:02.212
HAD, I THINK, AT THE TIME, ONE

00:43:02.279 --> 00:43:04.214
STAFFER WITHIN THE FILM

00:43:04.281 --> 00:43:07.251
COMMISSION RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:43:07.318 --> 00:43:08.585
MONITORING, YOU KNOW, WHAT WAS

00:43:08.652 --> 00:43:10.754
ESSENTIALLY $330 MILLION WORTH

00:43:10.821 --> 00:43:13.691
OF TAX CREDITS. OUR EFFORTS IN

00:43:13.757 --> 00:43:17.928
THE LAST ROUND, WHICH YOUR HOUSE

00:43:17.995 --> 00:43:20.898
HAD A LOT TO DO WITH UNDER PHIL

00:43:20.965 --> 00:43:23.267
TING LEADERSHIP AND NANCY

00:43:23.334 --> 00:43:25.302
SKINNER ON OUR HOUSE, WE WORK TO

00:43:25.369 --> 00:43:28.105
EXPAND THOSE POSITIONS TO BRING

00:43:28.172 --> 00:43:29.740
TO ADDITIONAL STAFF, TO THE FILM

00:43:29.807 --> 00:43:31.742
COMMISSION, TO BE ABLE TO

00:43:31.809 --> 00:43:34.745
ACTUALLY MORE TIGHTLY AND

00:43:34.812 --> 00:43:37.381
ROUTINELY OVERSEE THAT DATA

00:43:37.448 --> 00:43:38.549
COLLECTION. I THINK WHAT WE'RE

00:43:38.615 --> 00:43:40.284
DOING HERE IN THIS PROCESS IS

00:43:40.351 --> 00:43:41.552
SAYING, LET'S HAVE SOME

00:43:41.618 --> 00:43:43.487
STANDARDS ACROSS ALL

00:43:43.554 --> 00:43:44.855
APPLICATIONS SO THAT WE CAN LOOK
