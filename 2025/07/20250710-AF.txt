01:17:20.602 --> 01:17:22.704
HEAD START GAVE ME A SAFE PLACE

01:17:22.771 --> 01:17:24.406
TO LEARN, TO GROW, AND TO BE

01:17:24.473 --> 01:17:25.841
SEEN. IT GAVE HER THE PEACE OF

01:17:25.907 --> 01:17:27.609
MIND THAT EVERY PARENT DESERVES,

01:17:27.676 --> 01:17:28.410
THAT HER CHILD WAS IN GOOD

01:17:28.477 --> 01:17:29.678
HANDS, LEARNING AND CARED FOR.

01:17:29.745 --> 01:17:31.146
THAT'S WHY THIS FIGHT IS

01:17:31.213 --> 01:17:32.280
PERSONAL FOR ME. IN RURAL

01:17:32.347 --> 01:17:33.648
COUNTIES LIKE MODOC, SISKIYOU OR

01:17:33.715 --> 01:17:35.317
LASSEN, OR ANY OF THE 11

01:17:35.384 --> 01:17:37.052
COUNTIES I REPRESENT, DISTRICT

01:17:37.119 --> 01:17:38.520
ONE HEAD START ISN'T JUST ONE

01:17:38.587 --> 01:17:39.988
OPTION AMONG MANY, IT'S OFTEN

01:17:40.055 --> 01:17:42.157
THE ONLY OPTION. THE ONLY PLACE

01:17:42.224 --> 01:17:44.259
WHERE A CHILD CAN GET A MEAL, A

01:17:44.326 --> 01:17:45.027
HEALTH SCREENING, OR OFTEN THE

01:17:45.093 --> 01:17:46.762
ONLY LEARNING PROGRAM OR CHILD

01:17:46.828 --> 01:17:48.096
CARE OPTION. THE ONLY WAY A

01:17:48.163 --> 01:17:49.631
PARENT CAN GO TO WORK WITHOUT

01:17:49.698 --> 01:17:51.833
HAVING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN A

01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:52.367
PAYCHECK AND THEIR CHILD'S

01:17:52.434 --> 01:17:53.668
SAFETY. THIS IS NOT A PARTIZAN

01:17:53.735 --> 01:17:55.370
ISSUE. IT'S A VALUES ISSUE, A

01:17:55.437 --> 01:17:56.838
COMMUNITY ISSUE, AND A FUTURE OF

01:17:56.905 --> 01:17:58.940
OUR KIDS ISSUE. MY MOM WAS ABLE

01:17:59.007 --> 01:18:01.176
TO USE WHAT SHE NEEDED AND WORK

01:18:01.243 --> 01:18:03.278
HARD TO CREATE A BETTER LIFE. IT

01:18:03.345 --> 01:18:04.146
WAS A STEPPING STONE. WE NEED

01:18:04.212 --> 01:18:05.480
THOSE STEPPING STONES FOR OUR

01:18:05.547 --> 01:18:06.915
FAMILIES AS WE FACE SOME OF THE

01:18:06.982 --> 01:18:07.883
MOST CHALLENGING FINANCIAL TIMES

01:18:07.949 --> 01:18:10.118
OF OUR GENERATION. I FULLY

01:18:10.185 --> 01:18:12.287
BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO CUT OUR

01:18:12.354 --> 01:18:13.288
BUDGET AND CUT THE WASTE. I JUST

01:18:13.355 --> 01:18:14.923
HOPE THAT WE DON'T DO THAT ON

01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:16.925
THE BACKS OF OUR LOW INCOME

01:18:16.992 --> 01:18:17.926
WORKING FAMILIES AND OUR

01:18:17.993 --> 01:18:19.194
CHILDREN. I AM HERE TODAY

01:18:19.261 --> 01:18:20.395
BECAUSE SOMEONE INVESTED IN MY

01:18:20.462 --> 01:18:22.697
FUTURE WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL.

01:18:22.764 --> 01:18:24.132
PATRICK IS HERE TODAY BECAUSE

01:18:24.199 --> 01:18:24.833
SOMEONE INVESTED IN HIS. WE NEED

01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:26.701
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP DOING

01:18:26.768 --> 01:18:28.403
THAT FOR THE NEXT CHILD, THE

01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:29.604
NEXT SINGLE MOM, THE NEXT HEAD

01:18:29.671 --> 01:18:31.173
START KID WITH BIG DREAMS AND

01:18:31.239 --> 01:18:32.607
NOWHERE ELSE TO GO. NOW IS THE

01:18:32.674 --> 01:18:34.076
TIME TO LEAD WITH PURPOSE, TO

01:18:34.142 --> 01:18:36.011
PUT FAMILIES FIRST, TO PUT

01:18:36.078 --> 01:18:36.711
PEOPLE OVER POLITICS, AND TO

01:18:36.778 --> 01:18:38.847
INVEST IN THE PROMISE THAT EVERY

01:18:38.914 --> 01:18:39.514
CHILD BEHOLDS. RURAL CALIFORNIA

01:18:39.581 --> 01:18:41.116
IS DEPENDING ON IT. THE CHILDREN

01:18:41.183 --> 01:18:42.484
AND WORKING PARENTS OF

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:44.319

BIPARTISAN 66 ASSEMBLY MEMBERS

01:19:38.874 --> 01:19:42.911
PROTECT $1.7 BILLION IN FEDERAL

01:19:42.978 --> 01:19:44.679
HEAD START FUNDING THAT SERVES

01:19:44.746 --> 01:19:48.250
OVER 80,000 OF OUR STRUGGLING

01:19:48.316 --> 01:19:50.519
POOR KIDS IN THE STATE OF

01:19:50.585 --> 01:19:51.820
CALIFORNIA. THE RECENT FEDERAL

01:19:51.887 --> 01:19:53.188
BUDGET MAINTAINED THE EXISTING

01:19:53.255 --> 01:19:55.524
FUNDING FOR HEAD START, WHICH IS

01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:57.526
PROOF OF WHAT WE ARE CAPABLE OF

01:19:57.592 --> 01:19:58.960
DOING IN THIS CHAMBER WHEN WE

01:19:59.027 --> 01:20:01.897
ALL WORK TOGETHER ON BEHALF OF

01:20:01.963 --> 01:20:03.698
CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. THIS

01:20:03.765 --> 01:20:06.268
OUTCOME IS BECAUSE DEMOCRATS AND

01:20:06.334 --> 01:20:07.636
REPUBLICANS IN BOTH THE STATE

01:20:07.702 --> 01:20:09.504
ASSEMBLY AND STATE SENATE, AND

01:20:09.571 --> 01:20:11.206
IN BOTH HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

01:20:11.273 --> 01:20:12.507
AND THE UNITED STATES SENATE,

01:20:12.574 --> 01:20:14.509
WORKED TOGETHER AND PUT PEOPLE

01:20:14.576 --> 01:20:16.244
FIRST. THE HEAD START PROGRAM IS

01:20:16.311 --> 01:20:17.646
IMPORTANT TO ME BECAUSE IT

01:20:17.712 --> 01:20:19.548
SHAPED MY LIFE FOR THE BETTER.

01:20:19.614 --> 01:20:21.383
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, WHEN MY

01:20:21.449 --> 01:20:23.285
LIFE WAS HARD AND DIFFICULT FOR

01:20:23.351 --> 01:20:25.220
ME AND MY FAMILY, MY FIRST

01:20:25.287 --> 01:20:27.189
MEMORY OF EATING FRESH FRUIT WAS

01:20:27.255 --> 01:20:29.191
IN THE HEAD START PROGRAM. HEAD

01:20:29.257 --> 01:20:30.926
START PROVIDES THE POOREST,

01:20:30.992 --> 01:20:33.528
LEAST ADVANTAGED KIDS WITH EARLY

01:20:33.595 --> 01:20:35.463
CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AS WELL AS

01:20:35.530 --> 01:20:37.699
HEALTH, NUTRITION AND SOCIAL,

01:20:37.766 --> 01:20:40.135
EMOTIONAL, BEHAVIORAL AND DENTAL

01:20:40.202 --> 01:20:41.570
SERVICES. A BUDGET IS A

01:20:41.636 --> 01:20:43.438
STATEMENT OF OUR VALUES, AND THE

01:20:43.505 --> 01:20:45.840
HEAD START PROGRAM IS CRITICAL

01:20:45.907 --> 01:20:47.676
TO ALLOWING AMERICANS BORN INTO

01:20:47.742 --> 01:20:49.311
POVERTY A PATHWAY TO THE MIDDLE

01:20:49.377 --> 01:20:51.646
CLASS AND BEYOND. WE HELPED KEEP

01:20:51.713 --> 01:20:53.848
HEAD START FUNDED, BUT FUNDING

01:20:53.915 --> 01:20:56.017
HAS REMAINED FLAT FOR OVER THREE

01:20:56.084 --> 01:20:57.819
YEARS, AND DESPITE THE

01:20:57.886 --> 01:20:59.421
INCREASING COSTS. SO LET'S

01:20:59.487 --> 01:21:01.122
CONTINUE TO EXERCISE THE POWER

01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:04.226
OF BIPARTISANSHIP. LET'S STOP

01:21:04.292 --> 01:21:07.395
THE PARTIZANSHIP NATURE. SO MUCH

01:21:07.462 --> 01:21:10.031
OF THE CHAMBER THIS PAST SIX

01:21:10.098 --> 01:21:12.133
MONTHS HAS BEEN SNIPING AT ONE

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:13.868
PARTY OR ANOTHER. BUT WHEN WE

01:21:13.935 --> 01:21:15.470
FOCUS ON PROTECTING CHILDREN AND

01:21:15.537 --> 01:21:16.805
FAMILIES IN THE STATE OF

01:21:16.871 --> 01:21:18.173
CALIFORNIA, WE ARE CAPABLE OF

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:20.675
DOING THAT. I RISE AND URGE YOUR

01:21:20.742 --> 01:21:23.678

IMPORTANT. EVERY DAY I GO HOME

01:21:37.058 --> 01:21:39.427
AND I DRIVE BY A HEAD START AND

01:21:39.494 --> 01:21:40.962
EVERY DAY I THINK TO MYSELF,

01:21:41.029 --> 01:21:42.764
THANK GOD THE LIGHTS ARE STILL

01:21:42.831 --> 01:21:44.866
ON. THANK GOODNESS THE PARENTS

01:21:44.933 --> 01:21:46.668
ARE THERE AND THE CHILDREN ARE

01:21:46.735 --> 01:21:48.303
THRIVING. AND I WOULD HATE TO

01:21:48.370 --> 01:21:49.904
SEE A PROGRAM LIKE THIS GO AWAY,

01:21:49.971 --> 01:21:52.073
AND WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT

01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:53.241
WE ALL WORK TOGETHER, BECAUSE

01:21:53.308 --> 01:21:55.343
THOSE CHILDREN ARE OUR FUTURE.

01:21:55.410 --> 01:21:58.647
THIS PAST MAY, I ATTEND THE

WINTERS HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION

01:22:00.849 --> 01:22:02.217
CEREMONIES AND HOW MANY STUDENTS

01:22:02.284 --> 01:22:04.686
I SEE UP THERE, INCLUDING THEIR

01:22:04.753 --> 01:22:05.987
PARENTS, THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH

01:22:06.054 --> 01:22:08.023
THE HEAD START PROGRAM. AND IT

01:22:08.089 --> 01:22:09.691
WARMS MY HEART THAT THESE KIDS

01:22:09.758 --> 01:22:11.593
ARE GETTING OPPORTUNITY TO

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:13.194
GRADUATE AND ATTEND COLLEGE OR

01:22:13.261 --> 01:22:14.829
TRADE SCHOOLS. AND IF IT WASN'T

01:22:14.896 --> 01:22:16.364
FOR HEAD START, I DON'T KNOW

01:22:16.431 --> 01:22:17.565
WHERE THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE WOULD

01:22:17.632 --> 01:22:19.868
BE. SO I WANT TO THANK YOU BOTH

01:22:19.934 --> 01:22:22.003

01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:23.772

01:22:35.050 --> 01:22:37.585
SUPPORT OF ECR 12, AND I WANT TO

SUNNYVALE AND ALTURAS FOR THEIR

01:22:40.889 --> 01:22:42.924
WORK ON THIS ISSUE AND FOR BEING

01:22:42.991 --> 01:22:45.226
SUCH A GREAT MODEL OF WHAT HEAD

01:22:45.293 --> 01:22:47.195
START CHILDREN CAN GROW UP TO

01:22:47.262 --> 01:22:49.364
BE. HEAD START HAS SERVED AS A

01:22:49.431 --> 01:22:50.699
LIFELINE FOR OUR COMMUNITIES,

01:22:50.765 --> 01:22:52.600
SERVING NEARLY 40 MILLION

01:22:52.667 --> 01:22:53.668
AMERICAN CHILDREN AND FAMILIES

01:22:53.735 --> 01:22:55.804
SINCE ITS LAUNCH 60 YEARS AGO.

01:22:55.870 --> 01:22:57.772
UNDER PRESIDENT JOHNSON. I HAD

01:22:57.839 --> 01:23:00.075
THE HONOR OF SITTING ON MANY A

01:23:00.141 --> 01:23:02.243
LITTLE MAT IN HEAD START

01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:04.679
CLASSROOMS FOR HOURS ON END

01:23:04.746 --> 01:23:06.281
UNDER THE MENTORSHIP OF ED

01:23:06.348 --> 01:23:07.949
ZIEGLER, THE FOUNDER OF HEAD

01:23:08.016 --> 01:23:09.751
START AND CREATOR OF THE PROGRAM

01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:12.053
MODEL. CHILDREN WHO ATTEND HEAD

01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:14.122
START ARE MORE LIKELY TO FINISH

01:23:14.189 --> 01:23:15.290
HIGH SCHOOL AND ENROLL IN

01:23:15.357 --> 01:23:16.725
COLLEGE, AND LESS LIKELY TO BE

01:23:16.791 --> 01:23:20.428
ARRESTED. YET WE SEE THAT THAT

01:23:20.495 --> 01:23:21.663
BLUEPRINT NEEDS TO BE PROTECTED

01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:23.631
RIGHT NOW. LAST YEAR, HEAD START

01:23:23.698 --> 01:23:26.534
SERVED OVER 80,000 CALIFORNIA

01:23:26.601 --> 01:23:28.536
CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES AND

01:23:28.603 --> 01:23:30.505
KEPT OVER 26,000 CALIFORNIANS

01:23:30.572 --> 01:23:33.274
EMPLOYED. THERE ARE OVER 1900

01:23:33.341 --> 01:23:34.909
CENTERS ACROSS THE STATE WHERE

01:23:34.976 --> 01:23:36.845
OVER 7000 HOMELESS FAMILIES

01:23:36.911 --> 01:23:39.314
RECEIVE SERVICES. 9000 CHILDREN

01:23:39.381 --> 01:23:41.983
RECEIVE CARE FOR CHRONIC HEALTH

01:23:42.050 --> 01:23:43.618
CONDITIONS, AND OVER 76,000

01:23:43.685 --> 01:23:45.754
CHILDREN RECEIVE DENTAL CARE.

01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:47.722
WHILE HEAD START WAS SPARED FROM

01:23:47.789 --> 01:23:50.759
THE COMPLETE ELIMINATION IN THE

01:23:50.825 --> 01:23:52.427
FEDERAL BUDGET EARLIER THIS

01:23:52.494 --> 01:23:55.530
YEAR. THIS IS REALLY NOT A GREAT

01:23:55.597 --> 01:23:58.900
TIME TO REALLY THINK ABOUT

01:23:58.967 --> 01:24:00.268
CELEBRATING, ALTHOUGH WE MUST,

01:24:00.335 --> 01:24:01.936
BECAUSE THERE'S STILL MUCH WORK

01:24:02.003 --> 01:24:04.205
TO BE DONE. HEAD START STAFF AND

01:24:04.272 --> 01:24:07.175
OFFICES, INCLUDING IN MY COUNTY,

01:24:07.242 --> 01:24:09.577
ALAMEDA COUNTY, AND IN SAN

01:24:09.644 --> 01:24:11.045
FRANCISCO. WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT

01:24:11.112 --> 01:24:12.814
MAKING SURE THAT THEY RECEIVE

01:24:12.881 --> 01:24:14.649
FUNDING THAT THEIR PORTAL WAS

01:24:14.716 --> 01:24:17.085
CLOSED. WE GOT CALLS ABOUT THAT.

01:24:17.152 --> 01:24:18.920
OVER 2 MILLION CALIFORNIANS ARE

01:24:18.987 --> 01:24:20.855
SET TO LOSE THEIR HEALTH CARE

01:24:20.922 --> 01:24:23.958
UNDER THE RECENTLY SIGNED BILL,

01:24:24.025 --> 01:24:25.393
AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE

01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:27.195
THAT HEAD START IS REALLY ABOUT

01:24:27.262 --> 01:24:29.030
HAVING A HEALTHY START. FOOD

01:24:29.097 --> 01:24:30.899
ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS LIKE SNAP

01:24:30.965 --> 01:24:33.802
ARE BEING GUTTED, PUTTING THE

01:24:33.868 --> 01:24:34.836
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

01:24:34.903 --> 01:24:36.738
CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA WHO RELY

01:24:36.805 --> 01:24:39.574
ON THEM AT RISK. AND IN MY

01:24:39.641 --> 01:24:41.342
COUNTY, THERE ARE MORE THAN

01:24:41.409 --> 01:24:42.811
22,000 CHILDREN UNDER SIX YEARS

01:24:42.877 --> 01:24:44.612
OLD WHO RELY ON SNAP FOR THE

01:24:44.679 --> 01:24:46.314
FOOD THEY NEED TO GROW INTO

01:24:46.381 --> 01:24:48.049
STRONG AND HEALTHY ADULTS. IN

01:24:48.116 --> 01:24:50.618
THOSE HEAD START PROGRAMS, THE

01:24:50.685 --> 01:24:52.153
FAMILIES LIVING BELOW THE

01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:53.455
POVERTY LINE WHO RELY ON HEAD

01:24:53.521 --> 01:24:56.291
START ARE STILL IN JEOPARDY.

01:24:56.357 --> 01:25:00.762
MEMBERS CALIFORNIA EDUCATES 1 IN

01:25:00.829 --> 01:25:04.299
5 CHILDREN IN THIS COUNTRY. WE

01:25:04.365 --> 01:25:06.468
ARE THE PLACE WHERE WE CAN SEE

01:25:06.534 --> 01:25:08.903
SO MUCH LIFE AND POSSIBILITY

01:25:08.970 --> 01:25:11.806
HAPPEN, AND WE NEED TO ENSURE

01:25:11.873 --> 01:25:13.975
THAT WE'RE MAKING AMERICA

01:25:14.042 --> 01:25:16.945
HEALTHY AGAIN. IN DOING THAT

01:25:17.011 --> 01:25:18.112
NOW, I DON'T THINK THAT WE THE

01:25:18.179 --> 01:25:20.482
WAY THAT WE'RE DOING THINGS

01:25:20.548 --> 01:25:23.084
RIGHT NOW ENSURES THAT WE HAVE

01:25:23.151 --> 01:25:24.886
PATH TO MEDICAL CARE, DENTAL

01:25:24.953 --> 01:25:27.789
CARE, EARLY EDUCATION FOR

01:25:27.856 --> 01:25:30.225
800,000 CHILDREN NATIONWIDE,

01:25:30.291 --> 01:25:31.359
BECAUSE WE HAVE AN ISSUE OF

01:25:31.426 --> 01:25:32.894
POVERTY THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS,

01:25:32.961 --> 01:25:35.029
BUT WE STILL NEED TO ENSURE THAT

01:25:35.096 --> 01:25:37.532
VITAL PROGRAMS LIKE HEAD START

01:25:37.599 --> 01:25:39.701
ARE AT THE CENTER AND THE CORE

01:25:39.767 --> 01:25:41.903
OF WHAT WE DO FOR OUR CHILDREN

01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:42.904
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND

01:25:42.971 --> 01:25:44.205
THROUGHOUT THE NATION. WITH

01:25:44.272 --> 01:25:46.074
THAT, AND MY DEEPEST SUPPORT FOR

01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:47.709
A PROGRAM THAT I'VE BEEN HONORED

01:25:47.775 --> 01:25:50.211
TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN FOR

01:25:50.278 --> 01:25:51.112
MANY YEARS, I RESPECTFULLY

01:25:51.179 --> 01:25:53.414
REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK

01:25:53.481 --> 01:25:56.684
YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. BONTA,

01:25:56.751 --> 01:25:57.685
ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK-SILVA YOU

01:25:57.752 --> 01:26:00.388
ARE RECOGNIZED. GOOD MORNING,

01:26:00.455 --> 01:26:02.657
MEMBERS AND MR. SPEAKER, THANK

01:26:02.724 --> 01:26:07.896
YOU FOR PRESENTING H.R. 12. OVER

01:26:07.962 --> 01:26:10.265
60 YEARS AGO, PRESIDENT JOHNSON

01:26:10.331 --> 01:26:12.834
SIGNED INTO LEGISLATION THE

01:26:12.901 --> 01:26:15.537
BEGINNINGS OF THIS ANTI-POVERTY

01:26:15.603 --> 01:26:17.772
PROGRAM. AND INDEED, IT HAS BEEN

01:26:17.839 --> 01:26:20.608
A SUCCESS. THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS

01:26:20.675 --> 01:26:23.144
ACROSS THE NATION HAVE

01:26:23.211 --> 01:26:24.546
PARTICIPATED IN HEAD START. BUT

01:26:24.612 --> 01:26:26.447
ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL THINGS

01:26:26.514 --> 01:26:29.717
ABOUT HEAD START IS WORKING FOR

01:26:29.784 --> 01:26:31.185
CHILDREN IN THE EARLY

01:26:31.252 --> 01:26:32.587
DEVELOPMENTAL YEARS. WE KNOW

01:26:32.654 --> 01:26:34.455
THAT CHILDREN'S BRAINS ARE

01:26:34.522 --> 01:26:37.659
FORMING AND DEVELOPING AT A HUGE

01:26:37.725 --> 01:26:39.360
INCREASE BETWEEN THESE EARLY

01:26:39.427 --> 01:26:41.462
YEARS, WHICH IS WHY OUR EARLY

01:26:41.529 --> 01:26:43.765
CHILDHOOD EDUCATION PROGRAMS ARE

01:26:43.831 --> 01:26:46.301
NOT ONLY VITAL, BUT IMPORTANT.

01:26:46.367 --> 01:26:48.102
WE KNOW THAT WHEN CHILDREN ARE

01:26:48.169 --> 01:26:50.872
IN, NOT ONLY HEAD STARTS OR

01:26:50.939 --> 01:26:53.841
PRE-K OR TCS, THAT THESE ARE

01:26:53.908 --> 01:26:55.710
SAFE SPACES WHERE THEY'RE

01:26:55.777 --> 01:26:57.679
LEARNING. WE ALSO KNOW THAT HEAD

01:26:57.745 --> 01:27:01.015
STARTS IN PRE-K, AND TCS ARE THE

01:27:01.082 --> 01:27:02.717
FOUNDATION FOR THEIR PARENTS,

01:27:02.784 --> 01:27:04.852
FOR THEIR PARENTS TO BE INVOLVED

01:27:04.919 --> 01:27:06.688
IN THEIR EDUCATION. THEY'RE THE

01:27:06.754 --> 01:27:08.990
TRAINING GROUNDS FOR PARENTS TO

01:27:09.057 --> 01:27:11.726
BEGIN TO BECOME A FAMILIAR. MANY

01:27:11.793 --> 01:27:13.995
TIMES THE STUDENTS ARE COMING

01:27:14.062 --> 01:27:15.396
FROM OTHER COUNTRIES AND TO

01:27:15.463 --> 01:27:18.566
LEARN THAT ABOUT OUR AMERICAN

01:27:18.633 --> 01:27:20.435
EDUCATION SYSTEM. WE KNOW THIS

01:27:20.501 --> 01:27:23.671
IS MANY TIMES THE LAUNCHING PADS

01:27:23.738 --> 01:27:25.974
FOR MANY PARENTS TO BECOME

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:27.375
INSTRUCTIONAL ASSISTANTS AND

01:27:27.442 --> 01:27:29.978
WORK IN OUR SCHOOLS. THERE IS SO

01:27:30.044 --> 01:27:32.647
MUCH THAT HEAD STARTS DO, BUT

01:27:32.714 --> 01:27:34.182
FOR THOSE STUDENTS AND THE HOURS

01:27:34.248 --> 01:27:36.884
THEY SPEND AND THESE CLASSROOMS

01:27:36.951 --> 01:27:39.420
WHERE THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE

01:27:39.487 --> 01:27:41.122
DEVELOPMENTAL EDUCATION, WHERE

01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:43.691
THERE ARE TOUCHING AND PAINTING

01:27:43.758 --> 01:27:46.794
AND SINGING AND TALKING, WE NEED

01:27:46.861 --> 01:27:48.863
TO GO BACK AND ALL OF OUR

01:27:48.930 --> 01:27:51.733
SCHOOLS TO MAKING SURE THAT KIDS

01:27:51.799 --> 01:27:55.003
CAN BE KIDS, THAT WE MODEL THIS

01:27:55.069 --> 01:27:57.705
EDUCATION OF DEVELOPMENTAL IN

01:27:57.772 --> 01:28:02.176
EVERY STEP OF OUR EDUCATION. BUT

01:28:02.243 --> 01:28:04.379
WE KNOW THAT MORE THAN ANYTHING

01:28:04.445 --> 01:28:07.181
ELSE, EARLY LITERACY, EARLY

01:28:07.248 --> 01:28:09.517
DEVELOPMENT IS THE SUCCESS FOR

01:28:09.584 --> 01:28:12.153
GRADE SCHOOL EDUCATION. I AS A

01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:14.555
TEACHER FOR MANY YEARS, WE COULD

01:28:14.622 --> 01:28:16.958
CLEARLY SEE WHAT STUDENTS HAD

01:28:17.025 --> 01:28:18.893
BEEN IN A HEAD START PROGRAM OR

01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:20.862
A PRESCHOOL PROGRAM, AND WE

01:28:20.928 --> 01:28:22.330
COULD CLEARLY SEE THOSE KIDS

01:28:22.397 --> 01:28:25.266
THAT HAD NOT HAD THAT

01:28:25.333 --> 01:28:26.634
OPPORTUNITY. AND WE COULD SEE

01:28:26.701 --> 01:28:28.936
THAT WHEN STUDENTS LEARN AT THE

01:28:29.003 --> 01:28:31.439
AGES OF TWO, THREE, FOUR AND

01:28:31.506 --> 01:28:33.041
FIVE, THOSE ARE THE FASTEST

01:28:33.107 --> 01:28:34.842
LEARNING YEARS AND THEY COME

01:28:34.909 --> 01:28:37.111
EQUIPPED TO HAVE SUCCESS IN

01:28:37.178 --> 01:28:39.547
SCHOOL. SO WITH THAT, I'M VERY

01:28:39.614 --> 01:28:41.783
PLEASED TO SEE A BIPARTISAN

01:28:41.849 --> 01:28:44.285
EFFORT. WE NEED THIS MORE THAN

01:28:44.352 --> 01:28:48.322
EVER. I'M VERY HAPPY TO SEE THAT

01:28:48.389 --> 01:28:50.458
THIS FUNDING WAS PROTECTED, BUT

01:28:50.525 --> 01:28:53.227
WE HAVE TO STAY DILIGENT. WE

01:28:53.294 --> 01:28:56.197
HAVE TO STAY ALERT. WE HAVE TO

01:28:56.264 --> 01:28:58.800
KNOW THAT WITH FEDERAL CUTS THAT

01:28:58.866 --> 01:29:00.702
IT ISN'T JUST THIS PROGRAM.

01:29:00.768 --> 01:29:02.570
THERE ARE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT

01:29:02.637 --> 01:29:04.172
INTERSECT WITH THESE PROGRAMS,

01:29:04.238 --> 01:29:07.008
AND WE HAVE TO BE AWARE OF WHICH

01:29:07.075 --> 01:29:09.210
PROGRAMS WILL BE CUT AND ARE

01:29:09.277 --> 01:29:11.212
BEING PLANNED TO BE CUT, BECAUSE

01:29:11.279 --> 01:29:13.314
EARLY EDUCATION IS ESSENTIAL.

01:29:13.381 --> 01:29:15.917
BUT ALL OF OUR EDUCATION IS

01:29:15.983 --> 01:29:17.018
ESSENTIAL. AND WITH THAT, I

01:29:17.085 --> 01:29:21.355
STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT FOR H.R.

01:29:21.422 --> 01:29:23.524
12. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:29:23.591 --> 01:29:24.992

TO RISE TO JOIN THIS KUMBAYA

01:29:30.765 --> 01:29:33.334
MOMENT AND THANK OUR COLLEAGUE

01:29:33.401 --> 01:29:36.104

LEADERSHIP. AND, YOU KNOW, I

01:29:41.008 --> 01:29:43.311
THINK OUR COLLEAGUE FROM ALTURA,

ALTURAS, SAID IT BEST, PUTTING

01:29:45.346 --> 01:29:47.982
PEOPLE OVER POLITICS. YOU KNOW,

01:29:48.049 --> 01:29:50.218
THERE ARE POOR KIDS IN RED

01:29:50.284 --> 01:29:51.786
STATES, AS WELL AS BLUE STATES

01:29:51.853 --> 01:29:54.122
AND RED AREAS OF OUR STATE OF

01:29:54.188 --> 01:29:54.722
CALIFORNIA, AS WELL AS BLUE

01:29:54.789 --> 01:29:56.491
AREAS OF THE STATE OF

01:29:56.557 --> 01:29:57.825
CALIFORNIA. AND I'M HOPING THAT

01:29:57.892 --> 01:30:00.595
WE CAN CONTINUE THIS KUMBAYA

01:30:00.661 --> 01:30:02.296
SPIRIT, THIS BIPARTISAN SPIRIT,

01:30:02.363 --> 01:30:04.165
NOT ONLY FOR HEAD START, BUT FOR

01:30:04.232 --> 01:30:06.267
ALL THE OTHER CRITICAL FEDERAL

01:30:06.334 --> 01:30:07.802
EDUCATION FUNDING PROGRAMS.

01:30:07.869 --> 01:30:10.705
TITLE ONE THE INDIVIDUALS WITH

01:30:10.772 --> 01:30:12.607
DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT ON SO

01:30:12.673 --> 01:30:14.442
MANY FRONTS. WE NEED TO COME

01:30:14.509 --> 01:30:17.178
TOGETHER TO PUT OUR KIDS OVER

01:30:17.245 --> 01:30:19.380
POLITICS. SO I THANK AGAIN OUR

01:30:19.447 --> 01:30:20.181
COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP

01:30:20.248 --> 01:30:22.483

RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU. I ALSO

01:30:29.524 --> 01:30:31.292
RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS

01:30:31.359 --> 01:30:32.727
RESOLUTION. AND SOME MEMORIES

01:30:32.794 --> 01:30:34.862
CAME BACK AS A ALSO A GRADUATE

01:30:34.929 --> 01:30:37.465
OF A HEAD START IN SAN DIEGO

01:30:37.532 --> 01:30:39.534
PROGRAM WHERE MANY CHILDREN

01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:42.603
ENTER OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM WITH

01:30:42.670 --> 01:30:43.838
DIFFERENT CHALLENGES. I ENTERED

01:30:43.905 --> 01:30:46.007
WITH NOT WITH BEING AN ENGLISH

01:30:46.073 --> 01:30:47.508
LEARNER ONLY, ONLY BEING

01:30:47.575 --> 01:30:48.876
MONOLINGUAL SPANISH SPEAKER. AND

01:30:48.943 --> 01:30:51.045
SO I STILL REMEMBER THE FUZZY

01:30:51.112 --> 01:30:52.180
CHARACTERS THAT WERE USED BY OUR

01:30:52.246 --> 01:30:54.649
TEACHERS IN HEAD START AND GREAT

01:30:54.715 --> 01:30:55.883
MEMORIES, CERTAINLY OF LEARNING,

01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:58.319
STARTING TO LEARN THINGS LIKE

01:30:58.386 --> 01:30:59.654
ENGLISH AND OTHER OTHER SKILLS

01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:01.556
THAT I WAS NOT ABLE TO LEARN AT

01:31:01.622 --> 01:31:03.591
HOME BECAUSE I HAD PARENTS WHO

01:31:03.658 --> 01:31:05.293
WERE NEVER EVEN HAD A FIRST

01:31:05.359 --> 01:31:06.527
GRADE EDUCATION. SO I RISE IN

01:31:06.594 --> 01:31:08.396
SUPPORT OF OUR TWO MEMBERS WHO

01:31:08.462 --> 01:31:10.131
ARE PART OF OUR PROBLEM SOLVERS

01:31:10.198 --> 01:31:12.099
CAUCUS. I HEAR A LOT OF PRAISE

01:31:12.166 --> 01:31:12.867
ON THIS BIPARTISAN APPROACH.

01:31:12.934 --> 01:31:14.168
THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF

01:31:14.235 --> 01:31:15.937
CONVERSATIONS WE HAVE IN THE

01:31:16.003 --> 01:31:17.805
CAUCUS. AND WE HAVE OTHERS.

01:31:17.872 --> 01:31:19.173
HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE PRESENTING TO

01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:20.541
THIS BODY, BUT CERTAINLY VERY

01:31:20.608 --> 01:31:22.476
PROUD OF A MEMBER FROM ALTURAS

01:31:22.543 --> 01:31:23.811
AND SUNNYVALE AND THANK THEM FOR

01:31:23.878 --> 01:31:25.379
THEIR LEADERSHIP AND THE WORK

01:31:25.446 --> 01:31:26.447
THAT THEY PUT INTO ORGANIZING

01:31:26.514 --> 01:31:28.015
ALL OF US TO COME TOGETHER AND

01:31:28.082 --> 01:31:29.450
MOVE THIS FORWARD AND GET THE

01:31:29.517 --> 01:31:30.985
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO REALLY

01:31:31.052 --> 01:31:32.887
LISTEN TO THE SIGNIFICANCE AND

01:31:32.954 --> 01:31:33.721

YOUR MOM TO BE WALKING THROUGH,

01:32:00.882 --> 01:32:04.886

THROUGH THOSE STREETS WHERE

01:32:07.188 --> 01:32:08.756
THERE WAS, I MEAN, CRIME ON

01:32:08.823 --> 01:32:10.725
EVERY CORNER. BUT THESE KIDS

01:32:10.791 --> 01:32:13.761

01:32:23.371 --> 01:32:25.006

CHAMPIONED INITIATIVES THAT

TRANSFORMED NOT ONLY HIS TRIBE

02:00:36.862 --> 02:00:38.464
BUT THE ECONOMIC PROSPERITY OF

02:00:38.531 --> 02:00:40.032

BEACON OF HOPE FOR OTHERS IN THE

02:00:47.406 --> 02:00:49.342
TO WORK ALONGSIDE HIM ON MANY

02:00:49.408 --> 02:00:52.278
ISSUES IN MY FORMER ROLES AS

02:00:52.345 --> 02:00:53.579
TRIBAL CHAIRPERSON OF THE SAN

02:00:53.646 --> 02:00:58.184
MANUEL INDIAN TRIBAL GOVERNMENT.

02:00:58.250 --> 02:00:58.918
ONE OF THOSE EXPERIENCES THAT

02:00:58.985 --> 02:01:01.020
I'VE HAD WITH CHAIRMAN MAZZETTI,

02:01:01.087 --> 02:01:03.022
AND ALONG THE WAY, CHAIRMAN

02:01:03.089 --> 02:01:05.291
MAZZETTI, WOULD BRING UP ISSUES

02:01:05.358 --> 02:01:07.560
THAT MANY WOULDN'T EVEN THINK

02:01:07.627 --> 02:01:09.962
ABOUT. AND ONE OF THOSE IDEAS

02:01:10.029 --> 02:01:11.797
WAS, WAS ONE TIME CHAIRMAN

02:01:11.864 --> 02:01:13.032
MAZZETTI ASKED THE TRIBES, WHY

02:01:13.099 --> 02:01:16.168
ARE WE PAYING INTO THE STATE?

02:01:16.235 --> 02:01:18.938
AND THE ONE TIME HE ASKED THAT

02:01:19.005 --> 02:01:20.806
SOME LEADERS JUST TOOK THAT AS A

02:01:20.873 --> 02:01:22.241
FORM OF THE COMPACT, THAT WE

02:01:22.308 --> 02:01:23.876
NEEDED TO PAY THAT INTO THERE.

02:01:23.943 --> 02:01:25.845
BUT AS CHAIRMAN OF THE SEMINOLE

02:01:25.911 --> 02:01:27.546
TRIBAL GOVERNMENT, I STOOD WITH

02:01:27.613 --> 02:01:29.715
THE RINCON PEOPLE AND CHAIRMAN

02:01:29.782 --> 02:01:31.317
MAZZETTI, AND WE STARTED SENDING

02:01:31.384 --> 02:01:33.986
OUR PAYMENTS IN UNDER DURESS.

02:01:34.053 --> 02:01:36.555
AND LO AND BEHOLD, THE COURT

02:01:36.622 --> 02:01:38.324
RULED THAT THOSE PAYMENTS WERE

02:01:38.391 --> 02:01:40.593
VIEWED AS A TAX. AND BECAUSE OF

02:01:40.660 --> 02:01:43.062
HIS FORTITUDE AND RESILIENCY,

02:01:43.129 --> 02:01:44.730
THAT'S HOW THE MONEY NOW GOES

02:01:44.797 --> 02:01:46.866
INTO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OF

02:01:46.932 --> 02:01:47.767
WHERE THOSE TRIBES ARE AT. SO

02:01:47.833 --> 02:01:49.969
HIS RESILIENCY TO CONTINUE TO

02:01:50.036 --> 02:01:52.538
MOVE FORWARD AND NOT STAND FOR

02:01:52.605 --> 02:01:54.006

SHARE IN THE SUCCESSES OF INDIAN

02:02:08.654 --> 02:02:11.824

RESILIENCY THAT BROUGHT THAT

02:02:13.392 --> 02:02:18.230

02:02:18.297 --> 02:02:20.232
MANY IN INDIAN COUNTRY, AND HIS

02:02:20.299 --> 02:02:22.134
RESILIENCE TO A LOT OF THESE

02:02:22.201 --> 02:02:23.936

US INTO THAT MEETING, WHICH LAID

02:03:09.448 --> 02:03:11.817
THE WAY FOR THE CREATION OF THE

BEING BIPARTISAN TO EFFECT

02:06:29.915 --> 02:06:32.751

PRACTICAL PERSON WHO BELIEVED IN

GEORGE SUCCESSFUL WAS HIS STRONG

02:07:05.884 --> 02:07:08.320
BELIEF IN RELATIONSHIPS. HE

02:07:08.387 --> 02:07:10.122
VALUED THE LEGISLATORS AND

02:07:10.189 --> 02:07:12.591
COLLEAGUES HE WORKED WITH, AND

02:07:12.658 --> 02:07:14.393
FOR SEVERAL DECADES, HE WAS A

02:07:14.460 --> 02:07:16.762
TRUSTED VOICE IN A BUSINESS

02:07:16.829 --> 02:07:19.665
WHERE TRUST IS SOMETIMES HARD TO

02:07:19.732 --> 02:07:21.200
FIND. WHEN HE WASN'T LUNCHING AT

FRANK FAT'S, GEORGE WAS AN AVID

02:07:24.103 --> 02:07:25.938

IF I HAD A BAD STROKE, I CAN FIX

02:07:39.718 --> 02:07:42.187
IT NOW. IT'S IN THE PAST.

02:07:42.254 --> 02:07:43.622
WORRYING ABOUT IT IS TAKING

02:07:43.689 --> 02:07:45.391
ENERGY AWAY FROM WHAT YOU CAN DO

02:07:45.457 --> 02:07:48.394
NOW. FOCUS ON WHAT YOU CAN DO TO

02:07:48.460 --> 02:07:51.063
MOVE FORWARD AND WIN THE ISSUE.

02:07:51.130 --> 02:07:52.931

AND HE SAID THAT WHAT ENCOURAGED

02:07:56.668 --> 02:07:58.404
HIM ABOUT CALIFORNIA IS THAT

02:07:58.470 --> 02:08:00.939
