UNDERSTAND MY PRIORITIES AND OUR

00:37:23.074 --> 00:37:24.442
APPROACHES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:37:24.508 --> 00:37:26.210
INSURANCE. I LITERALLY JUST

00:37:26.277 --> 00:37:28.412
LANDED AND THE ALLERGIES

00:37:28.479 --> 00:37:31.015
STARTED. IT'S SACRAMENTO

00:37:31.082 --> 00:37:33.851
WELCOMING ME BACK, I GUESS AS A

00:37:33.918 --> 00:37:35.653
AS COMMISSIONER, I HAVE GROUNDED

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.189
OUR WORK IN A CLEAR SET OF

00:37:38.255 --> 00:37:38.889
RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE

00:37:38.956 --> 00:37:40.925
FOLLOWING ORDER ONE. TO PROTECT

00:37:40.992 --> 00:37:43.160
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WHO RELY ON

00:37:43.227 --> 00:37:44.729
INSURANCE TO PROTECT THEIR

00:37:44.795 --> 00:37:46.697
LIVES, LIVELIHOODS AND THEIR

00:37:46.764 --> 00:37:48.566
INVESTMENTS. TO THE STAFF WHO

00:37:48.633 --> 00:37:49.634
CARRY OUT THE DEPARTMENT'S

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:51.502
MISSION TO PROTECT CONSUMERS TO

00:37:51.569 --> 00:37:53.037
THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE,

00:37:53.104 --> 00:37:54.639
ESPECIALLY THOSE HISTORICALLY

00:37:54.705 --> 00:37:55.806
MARGINALIZED OR

00:37:55.873 --> 00:37:57.842
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY

00:37:57.908 --> 00:38:00.077
CATASTROPHES AND NATURAL

00:38:00.144 --> 00:38:01.479
CATASTROPHES, AND TO THE LONG

00:38:01.545 --> 00:38:04.148
TERM INTEGRITY OF CALIFORNIA'S

00:38:04.215 --> 00:38:05.850
INSURANCE MARKETPLACE, WHICH

00:38:05.916 --> 00:38:08.352
INCLUDES CONSUMERS, HOMEOWNERS,

00:38:08.419 --> 00:38:11.922
SMALL BUSINESSES, NONPROFITS,

00:38:11.989 --> 00:38:12.690
CORPORATIONS, AND, OF COURSE,

00:38:12.757 --> 00:38:15.226
THE INDUSTRY. MY DEPARTMENT HAS

00:38:15.292 --> 00:38:16.927
MADE TREMENDOUS STRIDES IN THESE

00:38:16.994 --> 00:38:18.896
PAST SEVERAL MONTHS IN

00:38:18.963 --> 00:38:20.931
IMPLEMENTING OUR STRATEGY. SOME

00:38:20.998 --> 00:38:22.700
GROUPS, YOU KNOW, NAMELY, I WAS

00:38:22.767 --> 00:38:25.002
JUST SAY, AND I'M GOING TO START

00:38:25.069 --> 00:38:27.471
PULLING PUNCHES IMMEDIATELY.

00:38:27.538 --> 00:38:28.806
CONSUMER WATCHDOG, ALONG WITH

00:38:28.873 --> 00:38:30.274
THOSE IN THE INSURANCE LOBBY,

00:38:30.341 --> 00:38:33.210
HAVE CARVED OUT POWER IN A

00:38:33.277 --> 00:38:35.680
DECADES OLD SYSTEM THAT REWARDS

00:38:35.746 --> 00:38:37.548
GRIDLOCK, WHERE BEING LOUD HAS

00:38:37.615 --> 00:38:39.350
OFTEN MATTERED MORE THAN

00:38:39.417 --> 00:38:41.085
ACTUALLY BEING EFFECTIVE. THESE

00:38:41.152 --> 00:38:42.953
GROUPS HAVE PLAYED OFF BY OLD

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:45.189
RULES, ARGUING AGAINST REFORMS

00:38:45.256 --> 00:38:46.457
WHILE THE MARKET IS CRUMBLING

00:38:46.524 --> 00:38:48.993
BENEATH US. WATCHDOG CONTINUES

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:50.294
TO COLLECT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

00:38:50.361 --> 00:38:52.630
IN FEES WITHOUT ANY

00:38:52.697 --> 00:38:53.764
ACCOUNTABILITY OR PUBLIC

00:38:53.831 --> 00:38:55.533
SCRUTINY. THESE FEES ARE PAID BY

00:38:55.599 --> 00:38:57.334
INSURANCE COMPANIES AND, OF

00:38:57.401 --> 00:38:59.036
COURSE, PASSED ON TO THE

00:38:59.103 --> 00:39:01.305
CONSUMER IN THEIR RATES, AGAIN

00:39:01.372 --> 00:39:03.007
ADDING TO ALREADY AN

00:39:03.074 --> 00:39:05.242
UNAFFORDABLE POLICY FOR SO MANY

00:39:05.309 --> 00:39:06.310
CALIFORNIANS THROUGHOUT THE

00:39:06.377 --> 00:39:08.112
STATE. AND OF COURSE, WE'VE SEEN

00:39:08.179 --> 00:39:09.613
THAT MANY CALIFORNIANS CONTINUE

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.782
TO BE LEFT WITHOUT COVERAGE.

00:39:11.849 --> 00:39:14.018
THESE CLAIMS THE WATCHDOG,

00:39:14.085 --> 00:39:15.553
CLAIMS TO SPEAK FOR CONSUMERS,

00:39:15.619 --> 00:39:17.121
BUT THEIR OWN RECORDS PUBLICLY

00:39:17.188 --> 00:39:18.956
SHOW THEY HAVE NO MEMBERS AND

00:39:19.023 --> 00:39:20.991
ONLY SERVE THEMSELVES THE

00:39:21.058 --> 00:39:22.426
GRANDSTAND, BUT DON'T OFFER ANY

00:39:22.493 --> 00:39:24.695
MEANINGFUL SOLUTIONS. YOU KNOW,

00:39:24.762 --> 00:39:26.130
TO ME, THAT'S NOT LEADERSHIP.

00:39:26.197 --> 00:39:27.932
THAT'S THE POLITICS OF DELAY.

00:39:27.998 --> 00:39:29.667
AND MY DEPARTMENT AND I ARE

00:39:29.734 --> 00:39:31.102
CONFRONTING IT HEAD ON. AS YOU

00:39:31.168 --> 00:39:33.237
WILL HEAR MORE IN DETAIL TODAY,

00:39:33.304 --> 00:39:35.005
OUR MISSION IS SIMPLE. CONSUMERS

00:39:35.072 --> 00:39:36.907
MUST HAVE REAL CHOICES, AND OUR

00:39:36.974 --> 00:39:38.275
GOAL IS TO REBUILD A

00:39:38.342 --> 00:39:39.243
SUSTAINABLE, COMPETITIVE

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:41.178
INSURANCE MARKET WHERE INSURANCE

00:39:41.245 --> 00:39:43.047
COMPANIES WANT TO DO BUSINESS

00:39:43.114 --> 00:39:45.149
AND NOT LEAVE THE STATE

00:39:45.216 --> 00:39:46.350
INSURANCE MARKET, WHERE

00:39:46.417 --> 00:39:47.685
CALIFORNIANS CAN PROTECT THE

00:39:47.752 --> 00:39:49.386
HOMES AND LIVES THEY HAVE WORKED

00:39:49.453 --> 00:39:51.655
SO HARD TO BUILD AND INVESTED

00:39:51.722 --> 00:39:53.724
IN. SO FOR THE PAST 30 YEARS,

00:39:53.791 --> 00:39:55.493
UNDER PROP 103, THE INSURANCE

00:39:55.559 --> 00:39:58.529
COMPANY COMPANIES HAVE NO ZERO

00:39:58.596 --> 00:40:01.732
LEGAL REQUIREMENT OR REGULATORY

00:40:01.799 --> 00:40:02.633
OBLIGATION, NONE WHATSOEVER, TO

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:04.401
WRITE POLICIES IN WILDFIRE

00:40:04.468 --> 00:40:06.670
DISTRESSED AREAS. THOSE ARE THE

00:40:06.737 --> 00:40:07.805
CURRENT RULES. THIS SYSTEM WE

00:40:07.872 --> 00:40:09.940
KNOW ISN'T WORKING AND IT HASN'T

00:40:10.007 --> 00:40:11.375
BEEN WORKING FOR DECADES. THAT

00:40:11.442 --> 00:40:13.577
IS WHY WE ARE BUILDING A NEW

00:40:13.644 --> 00:40:15.713
PATH FORWARD. WE JUST CAN'T TALK

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:17.648
ABOUT AFFORDABILITY WITHOUT

00:40:17.715 --> 00:40:19.750
FIRST ADDRESSING AVAILABILITY.

00:40:19.817 --> 00:40:22.019
YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY THAT OFTEN

00:40:22.086 --> 00:40:24.255
TIMES YOU CAN'T AFFORD WHAT

00:40:24.321 --> 00:40:27.091
DOESN'T EXIST. IT'S UNREALISTIC

00:40:27.158 --> 00:40:29.360
AND DISHONEST TO PROMISE THAT

00:40:29.426 --> 00:40:31.228
PRICES WILL GO DOWN OVERNIGHT.

00:40:31.295 --> 00:40:33.297
BUT WE ARE BUILDING AN ENTIRELY

00:40:33.364 --> 00:40:35.866
NEW SYSTEM WHERE PEOPLE CAN PAY

00:40:35.933 --> 00:40:36.934
FOR COVERAGE THAT THEY CAN

00:40:37.001 --> 00:40:38.903
ACTUALLY GET, NOT JUST BE PUSHED

00:40:38.969 --> 00:40:41.305
ONTO THE FAIR PLAN WITH HIGHER

00:40:41.372 --> 00:40:42.706
PREMIUMS AND LIMITED

00:40:42.773 --> 00:40:43.541
PROTECTIONS. AND AGAIN, HERE'S

00:40:43.607 --> 00:40:45.376
THE BOTTOM LINE. MEMBERS, UNDER

00:40:45.442 --> 00:40:47.211
THE LAST 30 YEARS, UNDER PROP

00:40:47.278 --> 00:40:50.247
103, RATES HAVE RISEN EVERY

00:40:50.314 --> 00:40:52.349
SINGLE YEAR, AND INSURANCE

00:40:52.416 --> 00:40:54.618
PRICES MAY CONTINUE TO RISE, BUT

00:40:54.685 --> 00:40:55.953
THEY WILL NOT. THEY WILL BE

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:58.956
NOWHERE NEAR THE COST OF BEING

00:40:59.023 --> 00:41:00.524
UNINSURABLE OR SELF-INSURED.

00:41:00.591 --> 00:41:03.561
JUST TALK TO THE THOUSANDS OF

00:41:03.627 --> 00:41:04.328
CALIFORNIANS WHO CURRENTLY

00:41:04.395 --> 00:41:06.597
CANNOT FIND COVERAGE, OR OF

00:41:06.664 --> 00:41:08.132
LOSING THEIR HOME, OR OF LOSING

00:41:08.199 --> 00:41:10.501
YOUR VALUED POSSESSIONS, OR OF

00:41:10.568 --> 00:41:13.204
LOSING YOUR COMMUNITY. PROP 103

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:14.738
REQUIRES PUBLIC INSPECTION OF

00:41:14.805 --> 00:41:16.574
ALL DEPARTMENT RATE FILINGS. WE

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.275
DID NOT SIDESTEP THIS

00:41:18.342 --> 00:41:20.144
REQUIREMENT. LITIGATION WOULD

00:41:20.211 --> 00:41:23.047
HAVE ONLY DELAYED. AND THIS

00:41:23.113 --> 00:41:24.081
RELIEF FOR CALIFORNIANS THAT

00:41:24.148 --> 00:41:26.150
THEY NEED. AND AS WE COMPLETED

00:41:26.217 --> 00:41:28.686
THESE REFORMS LAST DECEMBER, WE

00:41:28.752 --> 00:41:30.888
IMMEDIATELY TURNED TO OUR

00:41:30.955 --> 00:41:31.989
SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF

00:41:32.056 --> 00:41:34.191
THESE REFORMS. AND AS A LARGE

00:41:34.258 --> 00:41:35.726
REGULATORY DEPARTMENT, WE MUST

00:41:35.793 --> 00:41:37.728
GET THE IMPLEMENTATION RIGHT,

00:41:37.795 --> 00:41:39.530
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE SUCCEED

00:41:39.597 --> 00:41:41.832
OR WE FAIL. AND HERE ARE THE

00:41:41.899 --> 00:41:43.434
REFORMS THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:45.069
IMPLEMENTING IN OUR SUSTAINABLE

00:41:45.135 --> 00:41:47.104
INSURANCE STRATEGY. NEW

00:41:47.171 --> 00:41:48.973
CATASTROPHIC CATASTROPHE MODEL

00:41:49.039 --> 00:41:50.808
TOOLS THAT REWARD RISK

00:41:50.875 --> 00:41:52.042
MITIGATION, HOME HARDENING AND

00:41:52.109 --> 00:41:53.878
RESILIENCE. WE'RE STREAMLINING

00:41:53.944 --> 00:41:55.346
THE RATE, FILING REVIEWS WITH

00:41:55.412 --> 00:41:57.648
MORE ACCOUNTABILITY AND MORE

00:41:57.715 --> 00:41:58.916
TRANSPARENCY. WE ARE USING

00:41:58.983 --> 00:42:00.317
FORWARD LOOKING DATA THAT

00:42:00.384 --> 00:42:02.186
REWARDS OUR WEALTH, SAFETY

00:42:02.253 --> 00:42:03.988
ACTIONS AND THE THOUSANDS, IF

00:42:04.054 --> 00:42:06.023
NOT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT YOU

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:08.425
ALL HAVE INVESTED IN YOUR BUDGET

00:42:08.492 --> 00:42:11.128
TO ACTUALLY WORK ON MITIGATION

00:42:11.195 --> 00:42:13.097
FUNDING. GOING TO TAKE THAT INTO

00:42:13.163 --> 00:42:14.832
CONSIDERATION, MODERNIZATION OF

00:42:14.899 --> 00:42:17.167
OUR FAIR PLAN SO IT DOESN'T KEEP

00:42:17.234 --> 00:42:18.669
GROWING AS A SHADOW SYSTEM AND

00:42:18.736 --> 00:42:21.272
DRAG OUR ENTIRE MARKET DOWN. SO

00:42:21.338 --> 00:42:22.740
WE'RE JUST WE'RE NOT JUST

00:42:22.806 --> 00:42:24.308
REBUILDING AN INSURANCE MARKET.

00:42:24.375 --> 00:42:26.243
WE HAVE TO REBUILD TRUST. WE ARE

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:27.811
WORKING TO ENSURE THAT NO

00:42:27.878 --> 00:42:29.413
CUSTOMER IS LEFT BEHIND BECAUSE

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:32.116
OF THEIR ZIP CODE, THE ROOF TYPE

00:42:32.182 --> 00:42:33.851
THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE, OR WHERE

00:42:33.918 --> 00:42:36.053
THEY LIVE. MY DEPARTMENT IS NOW

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:37.922
MOVING WITH UNPRECEDENTED SPEED

00:42:37.988 --> 00:42:39.690
AND FOCUS TO IMPLEMENT THE

00:42:39.757 --> 00:42:41.292
VARIOUS REGULATIONS AND

00:42:41.358 --> 00:42:43.594
ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS OF OUR

00:42:43.661 --> 00:42:45.562
STRATEGY AND MONITOR THE

00:42:45.629 --> 00:42:47.231
RESPONSE IN THE CALIFORNIA

00:42:47.298 --> 00:42:48.565
INSURANCE MARKET. IT'S

00:42:48.632 --> 00:42:50.768
IMPERATIVE THAT WE DO THIS

00:42:50.834 --> 00:42:51.869
SIMULTANEOUSLY, NOT ONLY

00:42:51.936 --> 00:42:53.337
IMPLEMENT OUR REFORMS, BUT LOOK

00:42:53.404 --> 00:42:56.240
AT HOW THE MARKET IS ACTUALLY

00:42:56.307 --> 00:42:58.909
RESPONDING SO THAT WE ARE ABLE

00:42:58.976 --> 00:43:00.811
TO MANEUVER IF WE HAVE TO. IF

00:43:00.878 --> 00:43:02.346
WE'RE SEEING THAT CERTAIN

00:43:02.413 --> 00:43:02.947
INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE STILL

00:43:03.013 --> 00:43:04.615
NOT ENTERING CERTAIN PARTS, WE

00:43:04.682 --> 00:43:06.417
NEED TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT.

00:43:06.483 --> 00:43:07.484
MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE'LL HAVE THE

00:43:07.551 --> 00:43:09.086
TOOLS TO ACTUALLY SEE THAT NOW

00:43:09.153 --> 00:43:10.921
FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME. AND

00:43:10.988 --> 00:43:12.690
LAST DECEMBER, I FULFILLED MY

00:43:12.756 --> 00:43:14.058
COMMITMENT TO FINALIZING OUR

00:43:14.124 --> 00:43:15.693
STATE'S LARGEST REFORM IN 30

00:43:15.759 --> 00:43:17.761
YEARS. AGAIN, WE ACHIEVED THIS

00:43:17.828 --> 00:43:19.663
AMBITIOUS GOAL WITHIN A ONE YEAR

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:21.732
TIMELINE, CREATING ENTIRELY NEW

00:43:21.799 --> 00:43:23.267
LAWS AND PROCEDURES FROM THE

00:43:23.334 --> 00:43:25.269
GROUND UP IN RECORD TIME WHILE

00:43:25.336 --> 00:43:26.737
REMAINING THOROUGH, THOUGHTFUL

00:43:26.804 --> 00:43:29.006
AND DELIBERATE. BECAUSE WE ARE

00:43:29.073 --> 00:43:30.307
NOT STANDING STILL, WE ARE

00:43:30.374 --> 00:43:31.742
MOVING FORWARD. AND FOR THE

00:43:31.809 --> 00:43:34.044
FIRST TIME IN DECADES, INSURANCE

00:43:34.111 --> 00:43:36.113
COMPANIES ARE RESPONDING NOT TO

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:39.116
FEAR, BUT TO A CLEAR ACTUAL

00:43:39.183 --> 00:43:40.918
STRATEGY. AND CALIFORNIANS ARE

00:43:40.985 --> 00:43:42.853
ALREADY SEEING THE RESULTS.

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:44.088
WE'VE APPROVED HOMEOWNER

00:43:44.154 --> 00:43:45.923
HOMEOWNER RATE FILINGS,

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:47.758
SOMETIMES IN MULTIPLE FILINGS

00:43:47.825 --> 00:43:49.860
FOR EVERY TOP TEN HOMEOWNERS

00:43:49.927 --> 00:43:51.628
INSURANCE. WITH STRICT SCRUTINY,

00:43:51.695 --> 00:43:54.231
WE HAVE BROUGHT THE AVERAGE TIME

00:43:54.298 --> 00:43:55.366
TO REVIEW THESE RATE FILINGS

00:43:55.432 --> 00:44:00.304
DOWN FROM 281 DAYS TO 71 DAYS,

00:44:00.371 --> 00:44:04.675
AND THAT'S LESS THAN AND 2023.

00:44:04.742 --> 00:44:06.744
IN ONE IN QUARTER ONE OF THE

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:08.312
YEAR OF THIS YEAR, WE APPROVED

00:44:08.379 --> 00:44:09.980
17 HOMEOWNER FILINGS AND HAVE

00:44:10.047 --> 00:44:13.250

00:44:13.317 --> 00:44:15.719
NOW IS POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE

00:44:15.786 --> 00:44:17.254
BECAUSE AS PART OF OUR STRATEGY,

00:44:17.321 --> 00:44:19.390
WE ALSO HAVE TO HOLD OURSELVES

00:44:19.456 --> 00:44:20.724
ACCOUNTABLE AND HAVE THAT

00:44:20.791 --> 00:44:22.092
INFORMATION AVAILABLE FOR THE

00:44:22.159 --> 00:44:23.994
PUBLIC. SO BECAUSE OF OUR WORK,

00:44:24.061 --> 00:44:26.530
FARMERS ARE FARMERS COMPANY HAS

00:44:26.597 --> 00:44:28.165

00:44:33.404 --> 00:44:35.873

MERCURY. THEY ARE ALL STAYING IN

00:44:37.841 --> 00:44:40.244
OUR STATE AND GROWING. ALLSTATE

SAYS THEY WILL RETURN TO THE

00:44:42.346 --> 00:44:43.947
MARKET ONCE OUR STRATEGY IS

00:44:44.014 --> 00:44:46.683
FULLY COMPLETED. SO NOW LOOKING

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:48.552
FORWARD, WE ARE EXPECTING

00:44:48.619 --> 00:44:49.787
INSURERS TO START SUBMITTING

00:44:49.853 --> 00:44:53.390
THEIR FILINGS IN THE NEXT FEW

00:44:53.457 --> 00:44:54.691
WEEKS. THE NHÃ THESE NEW FILINGS

00:44:54.758 --> 00:44:56.727

00:44:58.395 --> 00:45:00.064
EVER TO EXPAND NEW WRITING IN

00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:01.865
OUR STATE, ESPECIALLY IN

00:45:01.932 --> 00:45:03.500
WILDFIRE DISTRESSED AREAS, AS

00:45:03.567 --> 00:45:04.902
WE'VE ALREADY PREVIOUSLY DEFINED

00:45:04.968 --> 00:45:07.538
IN OTHER BRIEFINGS. MY STAFF HAS

00:45:07.604 --> 00:45:08.705
WORKED TREMENDOUSLY HARD OVER

00:45:08.772 --> 00:45:10.441
THESE PAST SIX MONTHS, AND WE

00:45:10.507 --> 00:45:13.143
ARE NOW IN THE FINAL PHASE OF

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:14.845
REVIEWING SEVERAL WILDFIRE

00:45:14.912 --> 00:45:17.614
CATASTROPHE MODELS. OUR FILING

00:45:17.681 --> 00:45:19.383
INSTRUCTIONS ARE NOW COMPLETE

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:20.651
FOR INSURERS TO INCLUDE THEIR

NET COST OF REINSURANCE IN THEIR

00:45:22.453 --> 00:45:24.188

00:45:24.254 --> 00:45:26.323
INFORMATION, AGAIN, IS PUBLICLY

00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:28.125
POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE. SO I WANT

00:45:28.192 --> 00:45:29.660
TO THANK THE LEGISLATURE FOR

00:45:29.726 --> 00:45:31.328
CONTINUING TO APPROVE OUR BUDGET

00:45:31.395 --> 00:45:33.263
EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY FOR ME TO

PLACE TO HELP MY DEPARTMENT'S

00:45:37.167 --> 00:45:38.802
ACTUARIES, ANALYSTS AND LAWYERS

00:45:38.869 --> 00:45:40.871
WITH THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO

00:45:40.938 --> 00:45:43.273
REVIEW THESE FILES. AS A AND AS

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:45.008
INSURANCE COMPANIES START

00:45:45.075 --> 00:45:46.443
WRITING NEW POLICIES TOWARDS THE

00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:48.412
FULFILLMENT OF THEIR RATE FILING

00:45:48.479 --> 00:45:50.147
COMMITMENTS, WE WILL BE CLOSELY

MONITORING AND PUBLICLY POSTING

00:45:52.216 --> 00:45:54.051
PROGRESS ON OUR WEBSITE. SO

00:45:54.118 --> 00:45:56.687
AGAIN, EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT HOW

00:45:56.753 --> 00:45:58.856
THE MARKET IS RESPONDING TO

00:45:58.922 --> 00:46:00.891
THESE REFORMS. AND JUST AS OF

00:46:00.958 --> 00:46:02.960
YESTERDAY, THE FAIR PLAN NOW IS

00:46:03.026 --> 00:46:04.862
PUBLICLY RELEASING ITS PUBLIC

00:46:04.928 --> 00:46:07.264
COUNT POLICY COUNTS. THIS IS AN

00:46:07.331 --> 00:46:09.233
IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD AS WE

00:46:09.299 --> 00:46:11.401
CONTINUE TO MAKE THE FAIR PLAN

00:46:11.468 --> 00:46:12.169
MORE TRANSPARENT. AND WE MAY

00:46:12.236 --> 00:46:14.605
COME TO YOU WITH LEGISLATIVE

00:46:14.671 --> 00:46:16.406
PROPOSALS TO MAKE EVEN MORE

00:46:16.473 --> 00:46:17.774
TRANSPARENCY MEASURES WITHIN THE

00:46:17.841 --> 00:46:20.010
FAIR PLAN AND MAKE THEM ACTUALLY

00:46:20.077 --> 00:46:21.578
DURABLE. AND WE WILL BE TRACKING

00:46:21.645 --> 00:46:24.982
THE FAIR PLANS, TRENDS AS, AS,

00:46:25.048 --> 00:46:26.884
YOU KNOW, AS A SLOWING OR

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:28.152
REVERSAL OF THE FAIR PLAN

00:46:28.218 --> 00:46:29.853
GROWTH. AND THAT'S GOING TO BE

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:32.289
THE MOST IMPORTANT SIGNAL IN

00:46:32.356 --> 00:46:33.724
INCREASED INSURANCE AVAILABILITY

00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:35.159
ACROSS THE STATE. AGAIN, IF

00:46:35.225 --> 00:46:37.461
WE'RE SEEING THE FAIR PLAN

00:46:37.528 --> 00:46:39.429
DIMINISH IN SIZE AND SCOPE AND

00:46:39.496 --> 00:46:41.832
IN CERTAIN ZIP CODES, AND THAT

00:46:41.899 --> 00:46:43.700
INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE ENTERING

00:46:43.767 --> 00:46:45.636
BACK INTO THESE WILDFIRE AREAS,

00:46:45.702 --> 00:46:47.304
WE WILL NOW BE ABLE TO TRACK

00:46:47.371 --> 00:46:49.273
THAT AND GIVE YOU HOPEFULLY REAL

00:46:49.339 --> 00:46:51.074
TIME INFORMATION. SO THAT'S HOW

00:46:51.141 --> 00:46:53.377
WE'RE GOING TO MEASURE PROGRESS.

00:46:53.443 --> 00:46:55.779
AND I ALSO ANNOUNCED AGAIN A

00:46:55.846 --> 00:46:57.447
FORMAL INVESTIGATION LAST MONTH

00:46:57.514 --> 00:46:59.550
INTO STATE FARM'S HANDLING OF

00:46:59.616 --> 00:47:02.052
THOUSANDS OF INSURANCE CLAIMS

00:47:02.119 --> 00:47:04.054
FROM WILDFIRE SURVIVORS AFFECTED

00:47:04.121 --> 00:47:07.124
BY PALISADES AND THE WILDFIRES.

00:47:07.191 --> 00:47:08.492
CALIFORNIANS DESERVE FAIR AND

00:47:08.559 --> 00:47:09.760
COMPREHENSIVE TREATMENT FROM

00:47:09.826 --> 00:47:11.428
THEIR INSURANCE COMPANIES. NO

00:47:11.495 --> 00:47:13.163
ONE SHOULD BE LEFT IN

00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:15.199
UNCERTAINTY, FORCED TO FIGHT FOR

00:47:15.265 --> 00:47:16.934
WHAT THEY ARE OWED, OR FACE

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.403
ENDLESS DELAYS THAT OFTEN LEAD

00:47:19.469 --> 00:47:21.004
CONSUMERS TO GIVE UP. YOU'VE

00:47:21.071 --> 00:47:22.906
HEARD ALL THOSE STORIES BEFORE,

00:47:22.973 --> 00:47:25.209
MADAM CHAIR. A MARKET CONDUCT

THAT TYPICALLY TAKES SEVERAL

00:47:34.618 --> 00:47:36.186
MONTHS. THE DEPARTMENT IS

00:47:36.253 --> 00:47:38.455
CURRENTLY AGAIN, AND WE TOOK OUR

00:47:38.522 --> 00:47:39.723

FROM JUST NOT JUST FROM HEARSAY,

00:47:41.725 --> 00:47:44.294
BUT FROM ACTUAL COMPLAINTS

00:47:44.361 --> 00:47:46.063
SUBMITTED TO OUR DEPARTMENT. AND

00:47:46.129 --> 00:47:47.764
WE'RE ALSO NOW AT A DIFFERENT

00:47:47.831 --> 00:47:49.733
STAGE IN THE CLAIMS PROCESS FOR

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:51.735
THESE FOR THESE FIRES. THIS

00:47:51.802 --> 00:47:53.537
ALLOWS US TO BE MORE

00:47:53.604 --> 00:47:54.671
COMPREHENSIVE IN OUR REGULATORY

00:47:54.738 --> 00:47:56.173

THIS MAGNITUDE AND IMPORTANCE WE

ARE SEEING NOW, INSURERS ARE

00:47:59.476 --> 00:48:01.245
MAKING PAYMENT DECISIONS,

00:48:01.311 --> 00:48:02.579
ENABLING THE DEPARTMENT TO

CLAIMS HANDLING. AND THIS IS WHY

00:48:10.721 --> 00:48:12.389
WE TAKE OUR TIME TO MAKE SURE

00:48:12.456 --> 00:48:14.591
THAT WE'RE AT THIS STEP NOW OF

00:48:14.658 --> 00:48:16.293
THE PROCESS. DOING IT ANYTIME

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:17.527
EARLIER WOULDN'T HAVE YIELDED

00:48:17.594 --> 00:48:19.296
ANY TYPE OF INFORMATION, BECAUSE

00:48:19.363 --> 00:48:20.998
AT THAT TIME THEY WERE STILL

00:48:21.064 --> 00:48:21.732
JUST PAYING, YOU KNOW,

00:48:21.798 --> 00:48:23.166
ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSES. WE

00:48:23.233 --> 00:48:25.969
HAVE TO TAKE OUR TIME TO GET TO

THIS PART OF THE ENTIRE CLAIMS

00:48:28.205 --> 00:48:30.307

00:48:47.724 --> 00:48:49.526
NATIONAL STANDARDS FOR INSURANCE

00:48:49.593 --> 00:48:51.561
CLAIM HANDLING, THEY ARE. THEY

00:48:51.628 --> 00:48:53.363
CAN BE VAGUE AND INCONSISTENTLY

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:55.332
BE APPLIED, ESPECIALLY DURING

00:48:55.399 --> 00:48:57.034
LARGE SCALE CLIMATE DISASTERS,

00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:59.369
AS THE ONES THAT WE JUST

00:48:59.436 --> 00:49:01.171
EXPERIENCED. I ALSO WANT TO TAKE

00:49:21.525 --> 00:49:23.827
LITTLE CONTINUITY OF

00:49:23.894 --> 00:49:25.462
COMMUNICATION, INCONSISTENT

00:49:25.529 --> 00:49:26.863
MANAGEMENT OF SIMILAR CLAIMS,

00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:29.566
AND INADEQUATE RECORD KEEPING OR

00:49:29.633 --> 00:49:31.134
INFORMATION SHARING AMONG CLAIMS

00:49:31.201 --> 00:49:33.670
TEAMS. AMONG MULTIPLE OTHER

00:49:33.737 --> 00:49:35.105
COMPLAINTS THAT WE ARE

00:49:35.172 --> 00:49:36.606
INVESTIGATING, I WILL NOT LET

00:49:36.673 --> 00:49:38.675
ANY INSURANCE COMPANY EXPLOIT

00:49:38.742 --> 00:49:40.577
THIS CRISIS OR WALK AWAY FROM

00:49:40.644 --> 00:49:42.279
CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE PAID THEIR

00:49:42.346 --> 00:49:43.347
PREMIUMS AND PLAYED BY THE

00:49:43.413 --> 00:49:46.516
RULES. SO LET ME GIVE YOU SOME

00:49:46.583 --> 00:49:47.684
NUMBERS OF WHERE WE'RE AT UP TO

00:49:47.751 --> 00:49:49.486
DATE TODAY. WE'VE HELPED MORE

00:49:49.553 --> 00:49:50.587
THAN 12,000 SURVIVORS WITH

00:49:50.654 --> 00:49:52.289
WILDFIRE INSURANCE QUESTIONS AND

00:49:52.356 --> 00:49:53.824
ISSUES. WE'VE RECENTLY POSTED ON

00:49:53.890 --> 00:49:55.726
OUR DEPARTMENT'S WEBSITE. AS OF

00:49:55.792 --> 00:49:57.294
LAST MONTH, INSURANCE COMPANIES

00:49:57.361 --> 00:50:00.297
HAVE REPORTED MORE THAN 38,000

00:50:00.364 --> 00:50:03.200
CLAIMS FILED, WITH MORE THAN

00:50:03.266 --> 00:50:04.835
35,000 FULLY OR PARTIALLY CLAIMS

00:50:04.901 --> 00:50:07.571
PAID, TOTALING MORE THAN 17

00:50:07.637 --> 00:50:09.740
BILLION PAID TO CONSUMERS. ONE

00:50:09.806 --> 00:50:13.977
OF THE MORE THAN 38,000 CLAIMS

00:50:14.044 --> 00:50:16.246
FILED TO DATE, AROUND 1000

00:50:16.313 --> 00:50:17.481
COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN DIRECTLY

00:50:17.547 --> 00:50:20.517
FILED WITH US AT THE ON THESE

00:50:20.584 --> 00:50:22.819
CLAIMS, AND WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

00:50:22.886 --> 00:50:24.154
RECOVER A LITTLE MORE THAN 60

00:50:24.221 --> 00:50:25.922
MILLION TO DATE FOR SOUTHERN

00:50:25.989 --> 00:50:27.691
CALIFORNIA WILDFIRE SURVIVORS ON

00:50:27.758 --> 00:50:30.193
THESE COMPLAINTS ALONE. AND WE

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:31.928
CAN EXPECT THIS TO ONLY INCREASE

00:50:31.995 --> 00:50:33.764
AS THE SETTLEMENTS ARE BEING

00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:36.266
REACHED ON PRIMARY REBUILD OF

00:50:36.333 --> 00:50:38.602
TOTAL LOST HOMES AND BUSINESSES.

00:50:38.668 --> 00:50:40.637
AGAIN, WE'RE STARTING TO SEE NOW

00:50:40.704 --> 00:50:41.271
THESE CLAIMS MATURE MORE. WE'RE

00:50:41.338 --> 00:50:43.140
STARTING TO HAVE MORE MORE OF

00:50:43.206 --> 00:50:44.708
THE PRICE CONTAINMENT OF WHAT

00:50:44.775 --> 00:50:47.577
THE HOME HAD IN THE IN BEFORE

00:50:47.644 --> 00:50:49.546
THE FIRE. SO BUT I ALSO

00:50:49.613 --> 00:50:51.381
RECOGNIZE THERE'S MORE TO DO. WE

00:50:51.448 --> 00:50:52.682
HAVE LAUNCHED A MULTI-STATE

00:50:52.749 --> 00:50:54.718
COALITION TO TACKLE

00:50:54.785 --> 00:50:56.186
UNDERINSURANCE ISSUES, SOMETHING

00:50:56.253 --> 00:50:58.688
THAT WAS BROUGHT UP BY THIS

00:50:58.755 --> 00:51:00.323
COMMITTEE TOGETHER WITH NEW

00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:02.626
MEXICO, COLORADO, OREGON AND

00:51:02.692 --> 00:51:04.428
WASHINGTON. WE ARE GATHERING

00:51:04.494 --> 00:51:06.229
DATA AND BUILDING OUR

00:51:06.296 --> 00:51:07.564
UNDERSTANDING OF INSURANCE GAPS

00:51:07.631 --> 00:51:09.699
AND HOW TO REDUCE THE PREVALENCE

00:51:09.766 --> 00:51:12.302
OF POLICYHOLDERS BEING

00:51:12.369 --> 00:51:14.805
UNDERINSURED AFTER SEVERE FIRE,

00:51:14.871 --> 00:51:15.839
SOMETHING THAT ALL THESE STATES

00:51:15.906 --> 00:51:17.674
AND THEIR CONSUMERS ARE

00:51:17.741 --> 00:51:19.543
EXPERIENCING AFTER THEIR FIRES.

00:51:19.609 --> 00:51:21.478
THIS IS ONE OF THE MANY WAYS WE

00:51:21.545 --> 00:51:23.079
ARE PARTNERING WITH OTHER STATE

00:51:23.146 --> 00:51:24.614
REGULATORS IN WESTERN STATES TO

00:51:24.681 --> 00:51:26.650
STRENGTHEN OUR CAPACITY TO HELP

00:51:26.716 --> 00:51:28.485
CALIFORNIANS, BY EMPOWERING US

00:51:28.552 --> 00:51:30.353
TO LEARN FROM OUR COLLECTIVE

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:31.755
EXPERIENCE IN THE AFTERMATH OF

00:51:31.822 --> 00:51:33.557
MAJOR WILDFIRES. ADDITIONALLY,

00:51:33.623 --> 00:51:35.425
MY DEPARTMENT AND I CONTINUE TO

00:51:35.492 --> 00:51:36.460
ENCOURAGE WILDFIRE SURVIVORS

00:51:36.526 --> 00:51:38.562
THAT FEEL CLAIMS THAT ARE NOT

00:51:38.628 --> 00:51:40.664
BEING HANDLED PROPERLY AND

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:41.998
QUICKLY BY THEIR INSURER TO FILE

00:51:42.065 --> 00:51:43.834
A COMPLAINT WITH MY DEPARTMENT

00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:45.502
SO THAT WE CAN ASSIST THEM

00:51:45.569 --> 00:51:46.803
DIRECTLY AND GATHER IMPORTANT

00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:48.572
CONSUMER COMPLAINT DATA FOR

00:51:48.638 --> 00:51:50.774
STRONGER ACTIONS, IF NECESSARY,

00:51:50.841 --> 00:51:53.944
EVEN TO INCLUDE IN OUR ONGOING

00:51:54.010 --> 00:51:55.579
MARKET CONDUCT EXAMINATION.

00:51:55.645 --> 00:51:57.347
AGAIN, THIS IS IMPORTANT. SO IF

00:51:57.414 --> 00:51:59.149
CONSUMERS HAVE A COMPLAINT, HAVE

00:51:59.216 --> 00:52:00.851
THEM FILE THAT WITH OUR

00:52:00.917 --> 00:52:02.018
DEPARTMENT. IT'S EASIER THAN FOR

00:52:02.085 --> 00:52:03.653
US TRYING TO TRACK DOWN, YOU

00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:06.456
KNOW, HEARSAY OR SURVEYS OR SO

00:52:06.523 --> 00:52:08.091
FORTH. WE NEED REAL COMPLAINTS

00:52:08.158 --> 00:52:09.893
SO THAT OUR LAWYERS AND OUR

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:11.261
ANALYSTS CAN ACTUALLY LOOK AND

00:52:11.328 --> 00:52:12.729
START AN INVESTIGATION. IF WE

00:52:12.796 --> 00:52:14.264
NEED TO EXPAND OUR MARKET

00:52:14.331 --> 00:52:16.399
CONDUCT EXAM. TO GIVE YOU AN

00:52:16.466 --> 00:52:18.034
IDEA OF WHAT WE ARE SEEING ON

00:52:18.101 --> 00:52:20.337
THE GROUND IN TERMS OF THE

00:52:20.403 --> 00:52:21.037
CONSUMER COMPLAINTS, THEY

00:52:21.104 --> 00:52:22.806
INVOLVE DELAYS BY ADJUSTERS AND

00:52:22.873 --> 00:52:25.041
RESPONDING TO CLAIMS AND

00:52:25.108 --> 00:52:27.110
ULTIMATELY PAYING THESE WILDFIRE

00:52:27.177 --> 00:52:30.046
CLAIMS BY FIRE. MOST OF THE

00:52:30.113 --> 00:52:31.581
COMPLAINTS, AND IT'S NOT GOING

00:52:31.648 --> 00:52:33.517
TO BE A SURPRISE TO ANYBODY. OUR

00:52:33.583 --> 00:52:36.887
SMOKE DAMAGE CLAIMS. SO TODAY WE

00:52:36.953 --> 00:52:38.355
AS WE ALL KNOW, WE ARE

00:52:38.421 --> 00:52:39.589
EXPERIENCING THE AFTERMATH AGAIN

00:52:39.656 --> 00:52:41.558
OF THESE THE WORST WILDFIRES IN

00:52:41.625 --> 00:52:43.360
CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY. ONE, IT'S

00:52:43.426 --> 00:52:44.561
UNIQUE BECAUSE IT'S URBAN. IT'S

00:52:44.628 --> 00:52:46.596
AN URBAN FIRE THAT DEVASTATED

00:52:46.663 --> 00:52:48.698
ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOODS AND SPREAD

00:52:48.765 --> 00:52:51.034
TOXIC SOOT AND ASH ACROSS A WIDE

00:52:51.101 --> 00:52:52.802
REGION. IN THE PAST, WE'VE

00:52:52.869 --> 00:52:54.237
EXPERIENCED MASSIVE FIRES,

00:52:54.304 --> 00:52:55.972
INCLUDING IN SANTA ROSA AND IN

00:52:56.039 --> 00:52:57.541
PARADISE, BUT WE'VE RESPONDED

00:52:57.607 --> 00:52:59.175
WITH NEW INSURANCE RULES AND

00:52:59.242 --> 00:53:01.077
LAWS TO IMPROVE PAYMENT CLAIMS

00:53:01.144 --> 00:53:03.113
AND CUT RED TAPE, INCLUDING

00:53:03.179 --> 00:53:04.714
SPONSORING MANY OF THOSE LAWS

00:53:04.781 --> 00:53:06.049
THAT ARE NOW LAWS THAT WERE

00:53:06.116 --> 00:53:07.884
CHAMPIONED BY MANY OF THE FOLKS

00:53:07.951 --> 00:53:10.620
IN THIS ROOM. BUT WE HAVE NEVER

00:53:10.687 --> 00:53:12.222
EXPERIENCED SOMETHING OF THIS

00:53:12.289 --> 00:53:14.291
MAGNITUDE ACROSS SUCH AN URBAN

00:53:14.357 --> 00:53:15.892
AREA. AND WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS

00:53:15.959 --> 00:53:18.028
THAT OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS,

00:53:18.094 --> 00:53:20.096
THERE HAVE BEEN NO COMMON

00:53:20.163 --> 00:53:21.364
STANDARDS FOR PAYING SMOKE

00:53:21.431 --> 00:53:23.366
DAMAGE CLAIMS. THE RESULT OF

00:53:23.433 --> 00:53:25.135
THIS IS THAT PEOPLE ARE FORCED

00:53:25.201 --> 00:53:26.436
TO GO BACK TO HOMES THAT MAY,

00:53:26.503 --> 00:53:28.738
MAY OR MAY NOT BE SAFE. THIS IS

00:53:28.805 --> 00:53:30.607
WHY WE HAVE TO TAKE ACTIONS TO

00:53:30.674 --> 00:53:32.676
PROTECT PEOPLE NOW AND FOR THE

00:53:32.742 --> 00:53:34.077
FUTURE. SO WE RECOGNIZE THAT

00:53:34.144 --> 00:53:35.612
SMOKE DAMAGE IS A SERIOUS

00:53:35.679 --> 00:53:37.414
GROWING CONCERN FOR MANY

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:39.115
CALIFORNIANS. I ORDERED INSURERS

00:53:39.182 --> 00:53:41.351
TO FULLY INVESTIGATE AND PAY

00:53:41.418 --> 00:53:43.253
LEGITIMATE CLAIMS IN ACCORDANCE

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:45.021
WITH CALIFORNIA LAW. I SENT A

00:53:45.088 --> 00:53:46.456
LETTER TO THE FAIR PLAN

00:53:46.523 --> 00:53:49.626
DIRECTING THEM TO ACT LIKE ACT

00:53:49.693 --> 00:53:51.094
JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER INSURANCE

00:53:51.161 --> 00:53:52.629
COMPANY, AND FULLY INVESTIGATE

00:53:52.696 --> 00:53:55.432
AND PAY THESE CLAIMS AND TO THE

00:53:55.498 --> 00:53:57.634
BEST PRACTICES. MY TEAM

00:53:57.701 --> 00:53:59.202
CONTINUES TO DEMAND

00:53:59.269 --> 00:54:00.437
ACCOUNTABILITY ON THAT FOR THE

00:54:00.503 --> 00:54:02.906
FAIR PLAN. AND I HAVE TO SAY,

00:54:02.973 --> 00:54:04.741
TOO, THAT THE LACK OF CONSISTENT

00:54:04.808 --> 00:54:06.176
PUBLIC HEALTH STANDARDS FOR

00:54:06.242 --> 00:54:08.411
SMOKE DAMAGE HAS LED TO A LOT OF

00:54:08.478 --> 00:54:10.480
CONFUSION, DELAYS AND UNEVEN

00:54:10.547 --> 00:54:11.648
TREATMENT FOR HOMEOWNERS AFTER

00:54:11.715 --> 00:54:13.450
THESE FIRES. AND I ALSO WANT TO

00:54:13.516 --> 00:54:15.485
BE VERY CLEAR THIS IS NOT AN

00:54:15.552 --> 00:54:16.786
INSURANCE ISSUE. THIS IS A

00:54:16.853 --> 00:54:19.155
HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUE FIRST

00:54:19.222 --> 00:54:21.157
AND FOREMOST, AND NEEDS TO BE

00:54:21.224 --> 00:54:24.127
LED BY EXPERTS TO HELP US

00:54:24.194 --> 00:54:26.029
UNDERSTAND WHAT A FULLY

00:54:26.096 --> 00:54:27.864
REMEDIATED HOME WOULD LOOK LIKE.

00:54:27.931 --> 00:54:29.966
THIS IS WHY, AFTER MONTHS OF

00:54:30.033 --> 00:54:31.034
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO THE

00:54:31.101 --> 00:54:32.802
EXPERTS ARE, OR WHAT ARE SOME

00:54:32.869 --> 00:54:34.270
STANDARDS THAT ARE OUT THERE,

00:54:34.337 --> 00:54:36.406
EVEN INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS, WE

00:54:36.473 --> 00:54:38.642
COULDN'T FIND ANY. AND THIS IS

00:54:38.708 --> 00:54:40.543
WHY I DECIDED TO, YOU KNOW, TAKE

00:54:40.610 --> 00:54:42.646
THE BULL BY THE HORNS AND CREATE

00:54:42.712 --> 00:54:43.913
OUR SMALL CLAIMS AND REMEDIATION

00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:45.782
TASK FORCE AND MY DEPARTMENT.

00:54:45.849 --> 00:54:47.150
AND WE JUST ANNOUNCED ITS

00:54:47.217 --> 00:54:49.419
MEMBERS YESTERDAY, INCLUDING

00:54:49.486 --> 00:54:51.521
ACTUAL CONSUMER ADVOCATES, STATE

00:54:51.588 --> 00:54:53.823
AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS,

00:54:53.890 --> 00:54:56.292
FIRE SAFETY EXPERTS, SMOKE

00:54:56.359 --> 00:54:57.694
REMEDIATION SPECIALISTS,

00:54:57.761 --> 00:54:59.496
INDUSTRIAL HYGIENIST AND

00:54:59.562 --> 00:55:01.331
INSURANCE REPRESENTATIVES. THE

00:55:01.398 --> 00:55:03.366
TASK FORCE GOAL IS TO RECOMMEND

00:55:03.433 --> 00:55:04.801
WHERE STANDARDS ARE NEEDED AND

00:55:04.868 --> 00:55:07.270
WHICH AGENCIES MUST BE INVOLVED

00:55:07.337 --> 00:55:09.639
IN CREATING AND ENFORCING THEM.

00:55:09.706 --> 00:55:11.408
WE EXPECT THAT THE TASK FORCE

00:55:11.474 --> 00:55:13.243
COMPLETED ITS WORK IN JUST A

00:55:13.309 --> 00:55:14.844
HANDFUL OF MONTHS, AND BRING

00:55:14.911 --> 00:55:16.846
RECOMMENDATIONS BACK TO ME SO

00:55:16.913 --> 00:55:18.648
THAT WE CAN HAVE REAL SOLUTIONS.

00:55:18.715 --> 00:55:22.852
AGAIN, STAY TUNED. THOSE MIGHT

00:55:22.919 --> 00:55:23.653
BE. POSSIBLE LAWS THAT WE MIGHT

00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:25.855
NEED TO BE DRAFTING AS WELL,

00:55:25.922 --> 00:55:27.223
BECAUSE WE CANNOT WAIT ANOTHER

00:55:27.290 --> 00:55:29.025
30 YEARS OF THIS DELAY.

00:55:29.092 --> 00:55:30.126
CALIFORNIANS DESERVE TO RETURN

00:55:30.193 --> 00:55:31.494
TO THEIR HOMES THAT ARE SAFE,

00:55:31.561 --> 00:55:34.030
NOT TO BE LEFT IN THE DARK OR

00:55:34.097 --> 00:55:35.231
FORCED TO CLEAN UP THEIR OWN

00:55:35.298 --> 00:55:38.268
TOXIC SMOKE DAMAGE ON THEIR OWN.

00:55:38.334 --> 00:55:40.003
THIS IS SUCH A PREVALENT ISSUE

00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:42.405
THAT WE OFTEN HEAR CONSUMERS SAY

00:55:42.472 --> 00:55:44.207
THAT THEY HAVE RATHER MUCH,

00:55:44.274 --> 00:55:46.209
RATHER HAVE LOST THEIR HOME IN A

00:55:46.276 --> 00:55:48.144
FIRE THAN HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE

00:55:48.211 --> 00:55:49.913
SMOKE DAMAGE CLAIMS WITH THEIR

00:55:49.979 --> 00:55:51.981
INSURANCE COMPANIES. THAT IS NOT

00:55:52.048 --> 00:55:53.183
RIGHT. AND SO WE'RE GOING TO

00:55:53.249 --> 00:55:54.451
LOOK TO CHANGE THAT. SEVERAL

00:55:54.517 --> 00:55:56.653
OTHER STATES ARE LOOKING AT

00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:58.755
OTHER WAYS OF TRYING TO COME UP

00:55:58.822 --> 00:56:00.690
WITH STANDARDS. COLORADO PASSED

00:56:00.757 --> 00:56:04.294
A STUDY BILL, AS FAR AS I'M

00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:06.096
CONCERNED, THAT WE KNOW THERE'S

00:56:06.162 --> 00:56:07.063
STILL NO FUNDING BY THE

00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:08.298
LEGISLATURE TO PAY FOR THAT. SO

00:56:08.364 --> 00:56:10.100
WE JUST WENT AHEAD AND CREATED A

00:56:10.166 --> 00:56:11.468
TASK FORCE. GIVE US

00:56:11.534 --> 00:56:12.535
RECOMMENDATIONS. WE'RE GOING TO

00:56:12.602 --> 00:56:14.637
GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF MONTHS,

00:56:14.704 --> 00:56:16.272
COME BACK TO US, AND THEN WE'LL

00:56:16.339 --> 00:56:16.873
ENGAGE THE LEGISLATURE. IF WE

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:18.742
FEEL WE NEED TO DO EITHER NEW

00:56:18.808 --> 00:56:20.443
LAWS OR IF WE COULD DO THIS

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:21.544
REGULATORY OR WHAT OTHER

00:56:21.611 --> 00:56:23.346
AGENCIES CAN DO REGULATORY

00:56:23.413 --> 00:56:25.815
REFORMS SO THAT WE HAVE FINALLY

00:56:25.882 --> 00:56:28.818
SOME SOME SMOKE REMEDIATION

00:56:28.885 --> 00:56:30.453
STANDARDS THAT THAT COULD, QUITE

00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:32.822
FRANKLY, BE A MODEL FOR THE REST

00:56:32.889 --> 00:56:34.891
OF THE WORLD AND FOR THE NATION,

00:56:34.958 --> 00:56:36.693
SINCE NONE OF THOSE EXIST. ON

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:38.094
ANOTHER NOTE, MORE THAN THREE

00:56:38.161 --> 00:56:39.796
DECADES AGO, PROP 103

00:56:39.863 --> 00:56:41.664
ESTABLISHED A ROLE FOR PUBLIC

00:56:41.731 --> 00:56:43.032
PARTICIPANTS KNOWN AS

00:56:43.099 --> 00:56:44.768
INTERVENORS TO REPRESENT

00:56:44.834 --> 00:56:46.503
CONSUMERS INTERESTS IN THE

00:56:46.569 --> 00:56:47.837
PROCEEDINGS. IN MY OPINION,

00:56:47.904 --> 00:56:50.306
THAT'S THE JOB OF THE MEN AND

00:56:50.373 --> 00:56:50.874
WOMEN OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:52.509
INSURANCE. THESE INTERVENORS MAY

00:56:52.575 --> 00:56:53.977
PARTICIPATE IN THE DEPARTMENT'S

00:56:54.043 --> 00:56:55.678
PENDING RATE APPLICATIONS AND

00:56:55.745 --> 00:56:57.213
RULEMAKINGS, AND ARE ELIGIBLE TO

00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:59.115
RECEIVE COMPENSATION IF THEY

00:56:59.182 --> 00:57:01.484
HAVE MADE SUBSTANTIAL

00:57:01.551 --> 00:57:02.552
CONTRIBUTION TO THESE

00:57:02.619 --> 00:57:04.053
PROCEEDINGS AND PRESENTED

00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:06.189
RELEVANT ISSUES, EVIDENCE AND

00:57:06.256 --> 00:57:07.557
ARGUMENTS THAT ARE INDEPENDENT

00:57:07.624 --> 00:57:09.058
FROM THOSE RAISED BY THE

00:57:09.125 --> 00:57:11.161
DEPARTMENT STAFF FOR DECADES.

00:57:11.227 --> 00:57:13.296
ANY PAYMENT OF COMPENSATION TO

00:57:13.363 --> 00:57:14.764
THESE GROUPS IS MADE BY

00:57:14.831 --> 00:57:16.666
INSURANCE COMPANIES AND

00:57:16.733 --> 00:57:18.368
ULTIMATELY PASSED ON TO

00:57:18.434 --> 00:57:19.936
CONSUMERS THROUGH RATE INCREASES

00:57:20.003 --> 00:57:22.405
OR FEES ON POLICYHOLDERS

00:57:22.472 --> 00:57:24.507
PREMIUMS. WE ARE THE ONLY STATE

00:57:24.574 --> 00:57:26.676
IN THE NATION THAT HAS THIS

00:57:26.743 --> 00:57:28.077
PROCESS. THE INTERVENER PROCESS

00:57:28.144 --> 00:57:30.980
HAS NOT BEEN COMPREHENSIVELY

00:57:31.047 --> 00:57:33.249
REVIEWED IN OVER 30 YEARS.

00:57:33.316 --> 00:57:35.084
THAT'S UNTIL NOW. MY DEPARTMENT

00:57:35.151 --> 00:57:37.120
HAS BEEN REEXAMINING THE ENTIRE

00:57:37.187 --> 00:57:38.421
FRAMEWORK AS PART OF OUR

00:57:38.488 --> 00:57:40.256
SUSTAINABLE INSURANCE STRATEGY,

00:57:40.323 --> 00:57:42.125
OUR BROADER EFFORT TO MODERNIZE

00:57:42.192 --> 00:57:44.427
AND INCREASE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR

00:57:44.494 --> 00:57:46.529
EVERY STAGE AND EVERY

00:57:46.596 --> 00:57:48.498
PARTICIPANT IN THE RATE FILING

00:57:48.565 --> 00:57:51.134
PROCESS. BECAUSE EVERY DOLLAR

00:57:51.201 --> 00:57:52.836
COSTS THE CONSUMER THAT MUCH

00:57:52.902 --> 00:57:55.104
MORE FOR THEIR POLICY. OVER THE

00:57:55.171 --> 00:57:56.906
LAST TEN YEARS, THE DEPARTMENT

00:57:56.973 --> 00:57:58.875
HAS AWARDED NEARLY $10 MILLION

00:57:58.942 --> 00:58:01.211
IN COMPENSATION TO INTERVENORS,

00:58:01.277 --> 00:58:02.979
WITH PRIMARILY ONE INTERVENOR

00:58:03.046 --> 00:58:04.848
GROUP RECEIVING NEARLY ALL OF

00:58:04.914 --> 00:58:07.750
THIS COMPENSATION. CLOSER

00:58:07.817 --> 00:58:09.652
EXAMINATION OF THIS INTERVENOR

00:58:09.719 --> 00:58:10.987
PROCESS HAS REVEALED SEVERAL

00:58:11.054 --> 00:58:13.056
CONCERNS SO FAR. IN MANY

00:58:13.122 --> 00:58:14.624
INSTANCES, INTERVENORS RAISE

00:58:14.691 --> 00:58:16.593
ISSUES THAT ARE NOT RELEVANT OR

00:58:16.659 --> 00:58:18.561
EVEN DUPLICATIVE OF MY

00:58:18.628 --> 00:58:20.630
DEPARTMENT'S OWN STAFF REVIEW.

00:58:20.697 --> 00:58:22.232
THESE ACTIONS DO LITTLE TO

00:58:22.298 --> 00:58:23.933
CONTRIBUTE TO THE RESOLUTION OF

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.935
THESE PENDING RATE FILINGS, AND,

00:58:26.002 --> 00:58:28.238
IN FACT, CAN HELP EXACERBATE THE

00:58:28.304 --> 00:58:30.006
CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE IN

00:58:30.073 --> 00:58:31.374
SEEING OUR STATES THAT WE'RE

00:58:31.441 --> 00:58:32.942
SEEING IN OUR STATE'S INSURANCE

00:58:33.009 --> 00:58:34.911
MARKET GOING FORWARD. MY

00:58:34.978 --> 00:58:36.913
DEPARTMENT WILL NO LONGER GRANT

00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:38.948
INTERVENOR PETITIONS THAT RAISE

00:58:39.015 --> 00:58:41.517
ISSUES UNRELATED TO THE ACTUAL

00:58:41.584 --> 00:58:44.053
RATE APPLICATION. GOING BACK TO

00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:45.955
THE LETTER OF THE LAW OF PROP

00:58:46.022 --> 00:58:48.391
103. MOREOVER, COMPENSATION WILL

00:58:48.458 --> 00:58:50.827
NOT BE AWARDED UNLESS THE

00:58:50.894 --> 00:58:52.395
INTERVENOR CAN CLEARLY

00:58:52.462 --> 00:58:54.163
DEMONSTRATE A SUBSTANTIAL

00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:56.366
CONTRIBUTION TO THAT PROCEEDING.

00:58:56.432 --> 00:58:57.667
CONSISTENT AGAIN WITH THE LETTER

00:58:57.734 --> 00:59:00.370
AND THE SPIRIT UNDER WHICH THIS

00:59:00.436 --> 00:59:01.604
PROCESS WAS ESTABLISHED UNDER

00:59:01.671 --> 00:59:04.674
PROP 103, REGULATORY REFORM IS

00:59:04.741 --> 00:59:07.577
NEEDED TO IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY,

00:59:07.644 --> 00:59:09.646
REPORTING AND OVERSIGHT IN THIS

00:59:09.712 --> 00:59:11.781
AREA. AT THE SAME TIME, THE

00:59:11.848 --> 00:59:13.249
DEPARTMENT MUST ALSO BE

00:59:13.316 --> 00:59:14.784
ACCOUNTABLE. FOR EXAMPLE, I WAS

00:59:14.851 --> 00:59:16.519
MADE AWARE THAT THE DEPARTMENT'S

00:59:16.586 --> 00:59:18.021
INDEPENDENT ADMINISTRATIVE

00:59:18.087 --> 00:59:19.789
HEARING BUREAU HAD FAILED TO

00:59:19.856 --> 00:59:22.258
TIMELY REVIEW AND ISSUE PROPOSED

00:59:22.325 --> 00:59:25.161
DECISIONS IN APPROXIMATELY 25

00:59:25.228 --> 00:59:27.630
PENDING INTERVENOR COMPENSATION

00:59:27.697 --> 00:59:29.766
PETITIONS. AGAIN, THIS BACKLOG

00:59:29.832 --> 00:59:31.868
IS UNACCEPTABLE. IF INTERVENORS

00:59:31.935 --> 00:59:34.103
FULFILL THAT RESPONSIBILITY AND

00:59:34.170 --> 00:59:36.039
CONTRIBUTE MEANINGFULLY TO THE

00:59:36.105 --> 00:59:36.639
DEPARTMENT'S PROCESS UNDER THE

00:59:36.706 --> 00:59:38.474
LAW, THEY SHOULD NOT BE LEFT

00:59:38.541 --> 00:59:41.344
WAITING YEARS FOR PAYMENT. THIS

00:59:41.411 --> 00:59:43.813
ALSO DISCOURAGES OTHER

00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:45.581
INTERVENORS OR OTHER CONSUMER

00:59:45.648 --> 00:59:47.550
ACTUALLY CONSUMER GROUPS TO

00:59:47.617 --> 00:59:49.285
PARTICIPATE IN THE INTERVENOR

00:59:49.352 --> 00:59:50.687
PROCESS, MANY OF THEM WHO ARE

00:59:50.753 --> 00:59:52.555
NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO WAIT

00:59:52.622 --> 00:59:55.124
YEARS TO GET PAYMENT TO ADDRESS

00:59:55.191 --> 00:59:57.126
THIS ISSUE. IN DECEMBER 2024, I

00:59:57.193 --> 00:59:58.227
REASSUMED AUTHORITY OVER THE

00:59:58.294 --> 01:00:00.163
REVIEW OF THESE PETITIONS. AS

01:00:00.229 --> 01:00:01.831
THE TWICE ELECTED HEAD OF THE

01:00:01.898 --> 01:00:02.632
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

01:00:02.699 --> 01:00:03.766
INSURANCE, I AM PLEASED TO

01:00:03.833 --> 01:00:05.234
REPORT THAT ALL OF THE

01:00:05.301 --> 01:00:06.202
OUTSTANDING PETITIONS WILL BE

01:00:06.269 --> 01:00:08.037
RESOLVED BY THE END OF THIS

01:00:08.104 --> 01:00:09.539
MONTH. UNDER MY STRATEGY, I HAVE

01:00:09.605 --> 01:00:10.940
PRIORITIZED ACCOUNTABILITY FOR

01:00:11.007 --> 01:00:13.076
ALL PARTIES. AS I TOLD YOU,

01:00:13.142 --> 01:00:14.711
MADAM CHAIR AND MR. VICE CHAIR,

01:00:14.777 --> 01:00:16.579
ALL PARTIES THAT INCLUDES

01:00:16.646 --> 01:00:19.082
INSURERS, INTERVENORS AND MY OWN

01:00:19.148 --> 01:00:20.616
DEPARTMENT. EVERYONE INVOLVED

01:00:20.683 --> 01:00:23.152
MUST ADHERE TO THE TIMELINES AND

01:00:23.219 --> 01:00:24.887
RESPONSIBILITIES DEFINED IN THE

01:00:24.954 --> 01:00:27.323
STATUTES BY THE REGULATION. THIS

01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:29.726
MEANS EVERYONE, INCLUDING THE

01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:31.394
INSURANCE COMPANIES, RUN FAIR

01:00:31.461 --> 01:00:33.496
PLAN. FOR DECADES, A FAIR PLAN

01:00:33.563 --> 01:00:34.931
HAS FUNCTIONED AS THE INSURER OF

01:00:34.998 --> 01:00:36.733
LAST RESORT. FOR MANY

01:00:36.799 --> 01:00:38.534
CALIFORNIANS. HOWEVER, ITS

01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:40.336
EXPANSION HAS REVEALED DEEP

01:00:40.403 --> 01:00:42.472
FLAWS IN A SYSTEM THAT HAS NEVER

01:00:42.538 --> 01:00:44.374
DESIGNED TO BEAR THE WEIGHT IT

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:47.243
NOW CARRIES. TODAY, UNDER PROP

01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:49.879
103 TO BYPASS BYPASS HIGH RISK

01:00:49.946 --> 01:00:51.514
AREAS, INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE

01:00:51.581 --> 01:00:53.282
LEFT A GROWING NUMBER OF

01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:54.784
HOMEOWNERS AND BUSINESS OWNERS

01:00:54.851 --> 01:00:56.853
WITH NO OPTION BUT COSTLY,

01:00:56.919 --> 01:00:58.688
LIMITED FAIR PLAN COVERAGE.

01:00:58.755 --> 01:01:00.990
THAT'S GOING TO END NOW. MY TOP

01:01:01.057 --> 01:01:02.425
PRIORITY IS FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:04.427
MORE CHOICES IN A COMPETITIVE

01:01:04.494 --> 01:01:06.662
MARKET, AND FOR THOSE UNABLE TO

01:01:06.729 --> 01:01:08.131
FIND COVERAGE RIGHT NOW THAT THE

01:01:08.197 --> 01:01:10.266
FAIR PLAN NEEDS TO PROVIDE FULL

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:11.768
SERVICES AND BENEFIT PAYOUTS

01:01:11.834 --> 01:01:13.569
THAT CONSUMERS DESERVE QUICKLY

01:01:13.636 --> 01:01:15.671
AND FULLY, I HAVE ALSO INCREASED

01:01:15.738 --> 01:01:17.473
THE FAIR PLAN TRANSPARENCY BY

01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:19.542
USING MY EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY.

01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:21.010
EFFECTIVE YESTERDAY. THE FAIR

01:01:21.077 --> 01:01:23.212
PLAN IS SHARING INFORMATION WITH

01:01:23.279 --> 01:01:25.014
PUBLIC POLICY MAKERS AND THE

01:01:25.081 --> 01:01:26.549
PUBLIC ABOUT ITS CURRENT

01:01:26.616 --> 01:01:28.885
CONDITION AND SIZE. REMEMBER,

01:01:28.951 --> 01:01:30.753
RIGHT AFTER THE FIRE, EVERYBODY

01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:32.088
WAS WONDERING IF THE FAIR PLAN

01:01:32.155 --> 01:01:34.724
WAS GOING TO IMPLODE. EVEN THE

01:01:34.791 --> 01:01:35.792
TWO LADIES IN FRONT OF ME AT THE

01:01:35.858 --> 01:01:37.093
GROCERY STORE. AND I'M LIKE, DO

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:38.761
YOU HAVE INFORMATION THAT I

01:01:38.828 --> 01:01:40.196
DON'T HAVE? AND SO THIS IS

01:01:40.263 --> 01:01:41.030
FINALLY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT

01:01:41.097 --> 01:01:43.332
WE NEED TO HAVE PUBLIC

01:01:43.399 --> 01:01:44.600
TRANSPARENCY FOR THE FAIR PLAN.

01:01:44.667 --> 01:01:46.169
OTHER STATES THAT HAVE RECENTLY

01:01:46.235 --> 01:01:48.704
CREATED THEIR OWN FAIR PLANS ARE

01:01:48.771 --> 01:01:50.807
MUCH MORE TRANSPARENT THAN OURS

01:01:50.873 --> 01:01:52.275
THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE 60S.

01:01:52.341 --> 01:01:54.544
WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT. THIS IS

01:01:54.610 --> 01:01:56.479
REAL TIME DATA THAT IS CRITICAL

01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:58.848
AS WE WORK TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF

01:01:58.915 --> 01:02:00.683
THE FAIR PLAN AND BACK TO

01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:02.018
REGULAR MARKET. MY DEPARTMENT IS

01:02:02.085 --> 01:02:02.618
CURRENTLY INVESTIGATING FAIR

01:02:02.685 --> 01:02:04.020
PLANS HANDLING OF SMOKE DAMAGE

01:02:04.087 --> 01:02:05.988
CLAIMS FROM THE LOS ANGELES AND

01:02:06.055 --> 01:02:08.191
PREVIOUS WILDFIRES, AGAIN TO

01:02:08.257 --> 01:02:09.826
RESOLVE CONSUMERS ONGOING

01:02:09.892 --> 01:02:10.960
COMPLAINTS AND HELP PEOPLE GET

01:02:11.027 --> 01:02:12.862
BACK ON THEIR FEET AND RECOVER

01:02:12.929 --> 01:02:15.298
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AND

01:02:15.364 --> 01:02:17.100
FINALLY, I'M CREATING GREATER

01:02:17.166 --> 01:02:19.235
STABILITY TO SUPPORT OUR MARKET

01:02:19.302 --> 01:02:21.003
EXPANSION. DESPITE OPPOSITION OF

01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:22.305
THESE INSANE, ENTRENCHED

01:02:22.371 --> 01:02:24.674
INTERESTS. TO BENEFIT FROM THIS

01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:26.576
BROKEN SYSTEM, INSURANCE

01:02:26.642 --> 01:02:27.944
COMPANIES ARE PULLING BACK FROM

01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:30.413
OUR MARKET OVER FEAR OF AN

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.848
EXPANDING FAIR PLAN, WHICH

01:02:31.914 --> 01:02:34.383
BLOOMBERG NEWS CALLED THE HIDDEN

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:36.252
CRISIS. LAST YEAR, I ACTED TO

01:02:36.319 --> 01:02:37.653
STABILIZE THE MARKET CONDITIONS

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.388
WITH AN EXECUTIVE ACTION

01:02:39.455 --> 01:02:41.224
BRINGING CLARITY IN THE

01:02:41.290 --> 01:02:43.092
SITUATION OF A WORST CASE

01:02:43.159 --> 01:02:43.693
SCENARIO WHERE THE FAIR PLAN

01:02:43.759 --> 01:02:45.561
DOES NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO

01:02:45.628 --> 01:02:47.630
PAY ALL ITS CLAIMS. WE'VE JUST

01:02:47.697 --> 01:02:49.599
HAD THAT WORST CASE SCENARIO IN

01:02:49.665 --> 01:02:51.901
LOS ANGELES, AND LAST WEEK, MY

01:02:51.968 --> 01:02:53.903
DEPARTMENT ASKED THE JUDGE TO

01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:56.005
REJECT A LAWSUIT THAT DOES

01:02:56.072 --> 01:02:57.440
NOTHING TO ADDRESS THE STATE'S

01:02:57.507 --> 01:02:59.342
INSURANCE CRISIS. THIS LAWSUIT,

01:02:59.408 --> 01:03:01.711
THE LATEST FILED BY WATCHDOG,

01:03:01.777 --> 01:03:04.247
ONLY HURTS HOMEOWNERS, SMALL

01:03:04.313 --> 01:03:05.715
BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS WHO

01:03:05.781 --> 01:03:07.750
NEED ACCESS TO INSURANCE

01:03:07.817 --> 01:03:09.986
OPTIONS. THESE ARE THE FORCES OF

01:03:10.052 --> 01:03:11.888
DELAY AND DISTRACTION THAT HAVE

01:03:11.954 --> 01:03:13.923
CAUSED THIS CRISIS, AND I NEED

01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:15.758
YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT TO FINISH

01:03:15.825 --> 01:03:17.927
THIS JOB AGAIN. WE'RE PROUD TO

01:03:17.994 --> 01:03:21.030
SUPPORT AB 226. THAT'S GOING TO

01:03:21.097 --> 01:03:24.534
GIVE THE FAIR PLAN. ACCESS TO

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.469
MORE CREDIT AND MORE FINANCIAL

01:03:26.536 --> 01:03:27.970
TOOLS THAT THEY NEED TO STAY

01:03:28.037 --> 01:03:29.539
STRONG AND IN IN THE COMING

01:03:29.605 --> 01:03:31.007
WEEKS, MY STAFF'S EXPECTED TO

01:03:31.073 --> 01:03:32.408
FILE THE DEPARTMENT'S ONGOING

01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:34.177
FINANCIAL EXAMINATION OF THE

01:03:34.243 --> 01:03:35.945
FAIR PLAN, INCLUDING ITS

01:03:36.012 --> 01:03:37.813
COMPLIANCE WITH MY DEPARTMENT'S

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:39.515
2022 OPERATIONAL ASSESSMENT

01:03:39.582 --> 01:03:41.551
REPORT. WE CALL WE CALLED FOR

01:03:41.617 --> 01:03:43.319
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE FAIR

01:03:43.386 --> 01:03:45.388
PLANS, GOVERNANCE, OPERATIONS,

01:03:45.454 --> 01:03:46.656
UNDERWRITING, CLAIMS HANDLING,

01:03:46.722 --> 01:03:48.524
RISK MANAGEMENT, CONSUMER

01:03:48.591 --> 01:03:50.393
SERVICES AND FINANCIAL PLANNING

01:03:50.459 --> 01:03:51.761
STRATEGIES AND POLICIES. SO WE

01:03:51.827 --> 01:03:53.663
LOOK FORWARD TO SHARING WITH

01:03:53.729 --> 01:03:55.464
THAT WITH ALL OF YOU WHEN IT

01:03:55.531 --> 01:03:56.832
BECOMES FINAL. AND IN CLOSING

01:03:56.899 --> 01:03:58.534
AGAIN, WE NEED BOLD, LASTING

01:03:58.601 --> 01:04:00.469
REFORM AND THE POLITICAL COURAGE

01:04:00.536 --> 01:04:01.938
TO STICK WITH IT BECAUSE IT IS

01:04:02.004 --> 01:04:04.073
THE RIGHT THING TO DO REGARDLESS

01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:05.808
OF ALL THE POLITICAL ATTACKS,

01:04:05.875 --> 01:04:08.211
ALL THE NUANCED INVESTIGATIONS.

01:04:08.277 --> 01:04:11.247
THIS IS ALL TACTICS TO SLOW THE

01:04:11.314 --> 01:04:12.715
WORK OF THE DEPARTMENT. DO NOT

01:04:12.782 --> 01:04:14.817
BE FOOLED, BUT WE ARE READY AND

01:04:14.884 --> 01:04:16.686
WE HAVE BEEN READY AND WE'RE

01:04:16.752 --> 01:04:20.223
READY TO MEET THIS MOMENT AGAIN.

01:04:20.289 --> 01:04:21.891
WE OWE IT TO EVERY FIREFIGHTER

01:04:21.958 --> 01:04:23.359
WHO DEFENDED A NEIGHBORHOOD,

01:04:23.426 --> 01:04:25.094
EVERY SENIOR WHO WANTS TO RETIRE

01:04:25.161 --> 01:04:26.762
IN PEACE, EVERY FAMILY WHO

01:04:26.829 --> 01:04:28.898
DREAMS OF OWNING A HOME. WE ARE

01:04:28.965 --> 01:04:30.099
BUILDING A MODERN INSURANCE

01:04:30.166 --> 01:04:32.501
MARKET FOR THEM. THIS WILL BE,

01:04:32.568 --> 01:04:34.337
AGAIN, THE HARDEST WORK THAT I

01:04:34.403 --> 01:04:35.271
DO AS CALIFORNIA INSURANCE

01:04:35.338 --> 01:04:36.606
COMMISSIONER. BUT IT'S ALSO, I

01:04:36.672 --> 01:04:39.442
THINK, GOING TO BE THE MOST

01:04:39.508 --> 01:04:39.942
MEANINGFUL AND THE MOST

01:04:40.009 --> 01:04:41.510
IMPACTFUL MOVING FORWARD. I

01:04:41.577 --> 01:04:42.645
APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND I LOOK

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:45.281
FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK

01:04:45.348 --> 01:04:50.119
YOU SO MUCH. THAT WAS A LOT. I

01:04:50.186 --> 01:04:51.487
WE ALWAYS APPRECIATE YOU BEING

01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:54.924
HERE. SO BEFORE I TURN IT OVER

01:04:54.991 --> 01:04:56.692
TO MY COLLEAGUES, I WANTED TO

01:04:56.759 --> 01:04:57.893
ASK, HOW CAN YOU TELL US HOW

01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:59.195
INTERVENOR COMPENSATION IS

01:04:59.262 --> 01:05:01.197
DETERMINED? SO THE INTERVENOR

01:05:01.264 --> 01:05:04.100
COMPENSATION IS ONCE USUALLY IT

01:05:04.166 --> 01:05:05.735
HAPPENS TO THE BIGGEST COMPANIES

01:05:05.801 --> 01:05:07.436
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE

01:05:07.503 --> 01:05:09.605
INTERVENOR CAN GET MOST OF THE

01:05:09.672 --> 01:05:11.307
MONEY THEY COME IN. PREVIOUS TO

01:05:11.374 --> 01:05:13.776
MY ADMINISTRATION, THEY COULD

01:05:13.843 --> 01:05:16.078
COME IN, INTERVENE. YOU

01:05:16.145 --> 01:05:17.446
LITERALLY CUT AND PASTE SOME OF

01:05:17.513 --> 01:05:19.849
OUR OWN ISSUES THAT WE HAVE WITH

01:05:19.915 --> 01:05:21.350
THE FILE THAT WE'RE WORKING ON,

01:05:21.417 --> 01:05:23.619
AND THEN DELAY THE ENTIRE

01:05:23.686 --> 01:05:27.323
PROCESS UNTIL THEY WERE READY TO

01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:28.891
NEGOTIATE. THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE,

01:05:28.958 --> 01:05:30.559
BECAUSE THAT THEN BY THE TIME

01:05:30.626 --> 01:05:32.328
THAT RATE IS ACTUALLY APPROVED,

01:05:32.395 --> 01:05:33.963
IT NO LONGER MEETS THE RISK THAT

01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:36.999
IT'S INTENDED TO COVER. AND

01:05:37.066 --> 01:05:39.135
THAT'S WHY YOU SEE SUCH BACKLOG

01:05:39.201 --> 01:05:41.404
IN THESE RATE FILES. WE'VE CUT

01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:43.039
THOSE DOWN. WE'VE BEEN VERY

01:05:43.105 --> 01:05:44.473
AGGRESSIVE ABOUT JUST STICKING

01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:46.676
TO THE LETTER OF THE LAW WITH

01:05:46.742 --> 01:05:47.843
PROP 103 THAT SAYS, IF YOU'RE

01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:49.912
READY TO INTERVENE, YOU'RE READY

01:05:49.979 --> 01:05:50.980
TO INTERVENE. DAY ONE, WE'RE NOT

01:05:51.047 --> 01:05:53.082
GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO, YOU KNOW,

01:05:53.149 --> 01:05:54.517
STYMIE THIS PROCESS BECAUSE

01:05:54.583 --> 01:05:56.519
WE'RE IN A CRISIS. WE DON'T HAVE

01:05:56.585 --> 01:05:58.154
THE LUXURY OF WAITING. AND

01:05:58.220 --> 01:05:59.989
AGAIN, WE'RE SAYING YOU CAN'T.

01:06:00.056 --> 01:06:01.390
BUT WITH THESE REFORMS THAT WILL

01:06:01.457 --> 01:06:03.292
BE MADE, WE MAY WE WILL BE

01:06:03.359 --> 01:06:05.261
MAKING PUBLIC PRETTY SOON. IT'S

01:06:05.328 --> 01:06:07.029
GOING TO BE A REGULATION THAT'S

01:06:07.096 --> 01:06:07.663
GOING TO BE TRANSPARENT. HOLD

01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:09.198
HOLD THEM MORE TRANSPARENT,

01:06:09.265 --> 01:06:11.000
ACCOUNTABLE, WITH CLEAR

01:06:11.067 --> 01:06:12.968
GUIDELINES OF WHAT IT MEANS TO

01:06:13.035 --> 01:06:15.905
ACTUALLY BE PART AND BE A

01:06:15.971 --> 01:06:17.673
MEANINGFUL PARTICIPANT IN THE

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:19.175
RATE FILES. RIGHT NOW, IT'S SO

01:06:19.241 --> 01:06:21.077
VAGUE THAT ANYTHING COULD BE

01:06:21.143 --> 01:06:23.446
CONSIDERED INTERVENING, AND THAT

01:06:23.512 --> 01:06:25.214
ONLY DELAYS THE PROCESS, WHICH

01:06:25.281 --> 01:06:27.683
ONLY ULTIMATELY HURTS CONSUMERS.

01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:30.252
AND IF WE'RE AWARDING TAXPAYER

01:06:30.319 --> 01:06:32.788
MONEY TO THESE INTERVENERS, THEY

01:06:32.855 --> 01:06:34.390
ALSO SHOULD BE HELD TO THE SAME

01:06:34.457 --> 01:06:36.225
TRANSPARENT REGULATIONS AND

01:06:36.292 --> 01:06:38.527
REFORMS THAT ALL OF US HAVE TO

01:06:38.594 --> 01:06:40.629
DO. AND JUST AS WE DO IN OUR

01:06:40.696 --> 01:06:41.764
STATE BUDGET. RIGHT. AND SO IT'S

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:43.766
REALLY BRINGING SOME CONTROLS

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:46.369
THAT ARE LONG OVERDUE IN THE

01:06:46.435 --> 01:06:47.903
INTERVENER PROCESS IN TERMS OF

01:06:47.970 --> 01:06:50.539
HOW MUCH THEY THE COMPENSATION,

01:06:50.606 --> 01:06:51.941
HOW WHO DECIDES THAT? OR IS

01:06:52.007 --> 01:06:53.909
THERE A FORMULA DETERMINED BY BY

01:06:53.976 --> 01:06:55.444
ONE OF OUR INDEPENDENT JUDGES?

01:06:55.511 --> 01:06:56.779
AND NOW WE ARE BRINGING THAT

01:06:56.846 --> 01:06:59.014
BACK AND WE'RE HAVING OUR LEGAL

01:06:59.081 --> 01:07:00.182
TEAM REVIEW. SO THEY, THEY, THEY

01:07:00.249 --> 01:07:01.917
SEND US PRETTY MUCH A BILLING

01:07:01.984 --> 01:07:03.152
INFORMATION AND WE REVIEW IT TO

01:07:03.219 --> 01:07:04.754
SEE IF IT'S CONSISTENT WITH

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:06.589
THEIR ACTUAL INTERVENTION AND IF

01:07:06.655 --> 01:07:09.425
THEY'VE HAD MEANINGFUL

01:07:09.492 --> 01:07:11.494
INTERVENTION THROUGH THE PROCESS

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:13.396
BEFORE. IT WAS ESSENTIALLY JUST

01:07:13.462 --> 01:07:15.898
RUBBER STAMPED. OKAY. THANK YOU.

01:07:15.965 --> 01:07:18.367
I'M NOW I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY

01:07:18.434 --> 01:07:19.769
COLLEAGUES. ASSEMBLYWOMAN

01:07:19.835 --> 01:07:22.037
PETRIE-NORRIS, THANK YOU, MADAM

01:07:22.104 --> 01:07:23.906
CHAIR. AND THANK YOU,

01:07:23.973 --> 01:07:25.775
COMMISSIONER, FOR BEING HERE.

01:07:25.841 --> 01:07:28.544
AND I DO WANT TO COMMEND THE WAY

01:07:28.611 --> 01:07:30.346
THAT YOU AND YOUR TEAM ARE

01:07:30.413 --> 01:07:32.081
ATTEMPTING TO TACKLE THIS

01:07:32.148 --> 01:07:35.918
CRISIS. THIS IS YOU'VE HAD TO

01:07:35.985 --> 01:07:38.287
CONFRONT SOME BRUTAL FACTS AND

01:07:38.354 --> 01:07:39.889
SOME VERY INCONVENIENT TRUTHS.

01:07:39.955 --> 01:07:42.224
AND I THINK THERE ARE

01:07:42.291 --> 01:07:43.893
STAKEHOLDERS WHO WANT TO BELIEVE

01:07:43.959 --> 01:07:46.695
THAT WE CAN SORT OF WAVE A MAGIC

01:07:46.762 --> 01:07:47.430
WAND AND MAKE ALL OF THESE

01:07:47.496 --> 01:07:49.031
CHALLENGES GO AWAY. SADLY, WE

01:07:49.098 --> 01:07:51.600
ARE FRESH OUT OF MAGIC WANDS.

01:07:51.667 --> 01:07:53.402
THAT BEING SAID, I DO HAVE SOME

01:07:53.469 --> 01:07:55.504
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

01:07:55.571 --> 01:07:56.605
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

01:07:56.672 --> 01:07:58.207
SUSTAINABLE INSURANCE STRATEGY.

01:07:58.274 --> 01:08:00.609
I THINK, AS NOTED IN THE

01:08:00.676 --> 01:08:02.445
CONCLUSION OF THE COMMITTEE

01:08:02.511 --> 01:08:03.446
BRIEFING, BASED ON THE

01:08:03.512 --> 01:08:05.047
COMPLAINTS THAT THAT WE'RE

01:08:05.114 --> 01:08:06.682
CONTINUE TO RECEIVE FROM OUR

01:08:06.749 --> 01:08:07.616
CONSTITUENTS, IT DOESN'T FEEL

01:08:07.683 --> 01:08:10.152
LIKE IT'S MADE AN IMPACT ON THE

01:08:10.219 --> 01:08:13.656
MARKET. SO YOU DID OUTLINE IN

01:08:13.722 --> 01:08:15.658
YOUR COMMENTS THAT SOME OF THE

01:08:15.724 --> 01:08:16.325
PILLARS, THE SUSTAINABLE

01:08:16.392 --> 01:08:19.195
INSURANCE STRATEGY. CAN YOU HELP

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:21.530
US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE THE

01:08:21.597 --> 01:08:24.366
UPCOMING MILESTONES FOR THE

01:08:24.433 --> 01:08:25.334
IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT? AND AT

01:08:25.401 --> 01:08:27.503
WHAT POINT WILL YOU SAY YES?

01:08:27.570 --> 01:08:29.505
CHECK THE BOX. DONE. WE'VE

01:08:29.572 --> 01:08:31.941
IMPLEMENTED. YOU AND I ARE OVER

01:08:32.007 --> 01:08:32.875
LOCKSTEP BECAUSE I HAVE A WHOLE

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:34.743
TEAM THAT I EVERY MORNING I'M

01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:36.278
LIKE, WHEN IS THIS HAPPENING? SO

01:08:36.345 --> 01:08:37.913
WE ARE NOW, LIKE I SAID, MOVING

01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:40.182
INTO THE IMPLEMENTATION PHASE

01:08:40.249 --> 01:08:41.550
DESPITE THESE MEGA FIRES THAT

01:08:41.617 --> 01:08:44.086
WE'VE HAD AND DESPITE BEING

01:08:44.153 --> 01:08:45.454
CHALLENGED IN COURT AT EVERY

01:08:45.521 --> 01:08:48.891
MOVE THAT WE MAKE AND, AND, YOU

01:08:48.958 --> 01:08:50.493
KNOW, WE'RE BEING PULLED IN ALL

01:08:50.559 --> 01:08:52.261
DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. AND SO BY

01:08:52.328 --> 01:08:53.963
THIS MONTH, BY THE END OF THIS

01:08:54.029 --> 01:08:57.066
MONTH, WE WILL HAVE ALL OUR

01:08:57.132 --> 01:08:59.201
CATASTROPHE MODELS APPROVED, AND

01:08:59.268 --> 01:09:01.770
WE WILL BE ABLE TO START

01:09:01.837 --> 01:09:03.239
ACCEPTING NEW RATE FILES UNDER

01:09:03.305 --> 01:09:04.940
THE NEW REFORMS. THAT'S WHY YOU

01:09:05.007 --> 01:09:07.476
HAVEN'T SEEN REALLY THE MARKET

01:09:07.543 --> 01:09:08.644
CORRECT ITSELF YET WITH THESE

01:09:08.711 --> 01:09:10.713
NEW TOOLS, BECAUSE WE HAVE TO

01:09:10.779 --> 01:09:13.649
MAKE SURE THAT WE REVIEWED AND

01:09:13.716 --> 01:09:15.050
APPROVED THESE CATASTROPHIC

01:09:15.117 --> 01:09:17.253
RATE, THESE CATASTROPHE MODELS

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:18.687
FIRST, SO THAT WE'VE BEEN

01:09:18.754 --> 01:09:20.823
WORKING WITH THE TOP THREE

01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:22.658
MODELING GROUPS TO GET THAT

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:23.893
DONE, THAT WILL BE DONE, THAT

01:09:23.959 --> 01:09:25.628
WILL GET DONE THIS MONTH. AS WE

01:09:25.694 --> 01:09:27.963
SAID IN JULY, WE'RE ON SCHEDULE.

01:09:28.030 --> 01:09:29.498
AND WE ALSO ARE EXPECTING THE

01:09:29.565 --> 01:09:30.766
INSURANCE COMPANIES TO START

01:09:30.833 --> 01:09:32.468
SUBMITTING THEIR NEW RATE FILES

01:09:32.535 --> 01:09:34.370
TO BE ABLE TO USE THESE TWO NEW

01:09:34.436 --> 01:09:35.938
TOOLS WITH THE GUARANTEE THAT

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:37.506
THEY'RE GOING TO COME BACK INTO

01:09:37.573 --> 01:09:39.275
THESE COMMUNITIES. SO YOU'LL

01:09:39.341 --> 01:09:41.377
START SEEING DEFINITELY BY NO

01:09:41.443 --> 01:09:43.445
LATER THAN THE END OF THIS YEAR.

01:09:43.512 --> 01:09:45.047
STARTING OF NEXT YEAR, YOU'LL

01:09:45.114 --> 01:09:46.649
START SEEING MORE CORRECTION IN

01:09:46.715 --> 01:09:47.783
THE MARKET. BUT LIKE I SAID,

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:48.851
SOME OF THESE COMPANIES ARE

01:09:48.918 --> 01:09:50.753
ALREADY COMING IN, BUT WE NEED

01:09:50.819 --> 01:09:52.621
THEM TO COME IN INTO THESE

01:09:52.688 --> 01:09:53.489
WILDFIRE DISTRESS AREAS. SO

01:09:53.556 --> 01:09:55.724
AGAIN, WE'RE WE HAVE BEEN

01:09:55.791 --> 01:09:57.226
COMMUNICATION. WE HAVE BEEN IN

01:09:57.293 --> 01:09:58.294
COMMUNICATION WITH THE INDUSTRY.

01:09:58.360 --> 01:09:59.762
WE'RE LIKE, WE'VE DONE THE WORK.

01:09:59.828 --> 01:10:01.530
YOU BETTER BE READY TO FILE

01:10:01.597 --> 01:10:03.332
THESE NEW RATE FILES. BECAUSE,

01:10:03.399 --> 01:10:05.901
YOU KNOW, WHAT WE DON'T WANT IS

01:10:05.968 --> 01:10:07.102
FOR WE'RE READY, WE'RE OPEN,

01:10:07.169 --> 01:10:08.971
WE'RE READY. AND NOBODY'S FILING

01:10:09.038 --> 01:10:10.606
THESE RATE FILES YET. SO WE'VE

01:10:10.673 --> 01:10:12.775
BEEN VERY, VERY AGGRESSIVE

01:10:12.841 --> 01:10:14.209
TELLING THE COMPANIES WE HAVE

01:10:14.276 --> 01:10:16.078
BEEN WORKING WITH YOU, YOU NEED

01:10:16.145 --> 01:10:17.746
TO START GETTING THIS READY. AND

01:10:17.813 --> 01:10:19.915
NOW WE HAVE THE CONSULTANTS, THE

01:10:19.982 --> 01:10:21.116
ACTUARIES. THE STAFF WILL BE

01:10:21.183 --> 01:10:23.252
READY BY THE END OF THIS MONTH.

01:10:23.319 --> 01:10:25.588
OKAY. AND I THINK YOU SAID THAT

01:10:25.654 --> 01:10:28.257
YOU'RE ANTICIPATING THAT THE

01:10:28.324 --> 01:10:31.260
FIRST INSURERS WILL SUBMIT THEIR

01:10:31.327 --> 01:10:32.962
FILINGS IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.

01:10:33.028 --> 01:10:34.930
SO ONCE THOSE ARE SUBMITTED, HOW

01:10:34.997 --> 01:10:37.533
LONG WILL IT TAKE TO APPROVE?

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:40.436
BECAUSE WE'RE ALSO ANTICIPATING

01:10:40.502 --> 01:10:41.770
CONSUMER WATCHDOG TO INTERVENE

01:10:41.837 --> 01:10:44.373
ON THESE FILES OR POTENTIALLY

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:46.108
EVEN TRY TO CHALLENGE THIS PART

01:10:46.175 --> 01:10:48.177
OF IT IN COURT. SO WE DON'T

01:10:48.243 --> 01:10:51.180
KNOW, YOU KNOW, WHERE WE WERE

01:10:51.246 --> 01:10:53.749
ANTICIPATING, JUST CONTINUING TO

01:10:53.816 --> 01:10:55.884
HAVE FOLKS TRY TO STYMIE THE

01:10:55.951 --> 01:10:57.720
PROCESS. BUT THAT'S THE REALITY

01:10:57.786 --> 01:11:00.055
THAT WE FACE, THAT IF WE HAVE A

01:11:00.122 --> 01:11:01.457
RATE FILE AND IT GETS

01:11:01.523 --> 01:11:02.491
INTERVENED, WE'RE GOING TO DO

01:11:02.558 --> 01:11:05.060
OUR DUE DILIGENCE TO KEEP THEM,

01:11:05.127 --> 01:11:06.729
YOU KNOW, BY THE LETTER OF THE

01:11:06.795 --> 01:11:08.230
LAW OF PROP 103 SAYS TO GET THIS

01:11:08.297 --> 01:11:09.632
APPROVED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

01:11:09.698 --> 01:11:11.333
OF COURSE, ONCE IT MEETS OUR

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:12.701
SCRUTINY IN THE DEPARTMENT AND

01:11:12.768 --> 01:11:14.637
IT MEETS, YOU KNOW, WHAT, WHAT

01:11:14.703 --> 01:11:16.071
WE'RE LOOKING FOR, AND THEN GET

01:11:16.138 --> 01:11:18.273
THOSE APPROVED. AND SO BUT

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:20.109
THAT'S JUST THE REALITY OF OUR

01:11:20.175 --> 01:11:21.276
SYSTEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT

01:11:21.343 --> 01:11:22.811
AT LEAST WE ARE NOW BEING MUCH

01:11:22.878 --> 01:11:24.647
MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH WHAT DOES

01:11:24.713 --> 01:11:26.715
IT MEAN. AND THIS IS WHY WE FELT

01:11:26.782 --> 01:11:28.017
IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET THIS

01:11:28.083 --> 01:11:30.052
REGULATORY REFORM STARTED AS

01:11:30.119 --> 01:11:31.820
WELL, SO THAT WE COULD CREATE

01:11:31.887 --> 01:11:34.089
KIND OF THOSE SAFEGUARDS FOR

01:11:34.156 --> 01:11:35.557
WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO INTERVENE.

01:11:35.624 --> 01:11:36.859
RIGHT. AND TO AND IF WE'RE GOING

01:11:36.925 --> 01:11:38.160
TO HAVE INTERVENORS HAVE

01:11:38.227 --> 01:11:40.262
INTERVENORS ACTUALLY BE FOLKS

01:11:40.329 --> 01:11:41.897
THAT REPRESENT THE COMMUNITIES,

01:11:41.964 --> 01:11:43.399
AND MANY OF THEM DON'T INTERVENE

01:11:43.465 --> 01:11:45.334
JUST BECAUSE IT TAKES SO LONG TO

01:11:45.401 --> 01:11:47.269
GET THE COMPENSATION. SO ONLY

01:11:47.336 --> 01:11:49.838
THE ONE ORGANIZATION THAT HAS

01:11:49.905 --> 01:11:51.173
MASTERMIND, THIS ENTIRE THING IS

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:52.775
THE ONLY ONE THAT COULD GET

01:11:52.841 --> 01:11:54.476
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OFF OF IT.

01:11:54.543 --> 01:11:55.844
BUT IT'S TIME FOR US TO CREATE A

01:11:55.911 --> 01:11:56.979
LEVEL PLAYING FIELD AND CREATE

01:11:57.046 --> 01:11:58.547
SOME CLEAR DEFINITIONS OF WHAT

01:11:58.614 --> 01:12:00.616
DOES IT MEAN TO ACTUALLY

01:12:00.683 --> 01:12:02.051
INTERVENE. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:12:02.117 --> 01:12:02.885
DOING THROUGH THE REGULATION.

01:12:02.951 --> 01:12:05.421
GOT IT. AND SUBJECT TO, I GUESS,

01:12:05.487 --> 01:12:06.889
FORCES BEYOND YOUR CONTROL FOR

01:12:06.955 --> 01:12:09.324
YOUR TEAM, WHAT IS THE

01:12:09.391 --> 01:12:09.992
EXPECTATION OR THE GOAL THAT

01:12:10.059 --> 01:12:12.695
YOU'VE SET FOR THEM FOR TURNING

01:12:12.761 --> 01:12:13.629
AROUND THESE FILINGS? WELL,

01:12:13.696 --> 01:12:16.131
WE'VE WE'VE ALREADY CUT THE TIME

01:12:16.198 --> 01:12:17.666
SIGNIFICANTLY FROM A COUPLE

01:12:17.733 --> 01:12:19.735
HUNDRED DAYS TO LIKE 71 DAYS,

01:12:19.802 --> 01:12:22.638
WHICH IS, YOU KNOW, IT'S A 71

01:12:22.705 --> 01:12:25.808
DAY DECREASE ALREADY. BUT WE'RE

01:12:25.874 --> 01:12:29.011
STAFFED UP, WE'RE HIRED, WE HAVE

01:12:29.078 --> 01:12:31.313
OUTSIDE SUPPORT NOW, WHICH WE

01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:32.748
DIDN'T HAVE. SO WE'RE READY.

01:12:32.815 --> 01:12:33.682
WE'RE GOING TO BE READY FOR

01:12:33.749 --> 01:12:36.885
THESE RATE FILES TO GET THEM

01:12:36.952 --> 01:12:38.554
DONE. OKAY. GREAT. THANK YOU.

01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:42.391
ASSEMBLYWOMAN ORTEGA. THANK YOU

01:12:42.458 --> 01:12:45.761
COMMISSIONER. IT'S BEEN, YOU

01:12:45.828 --> 01:12:48.397
KNOW, A ROUGH FEW MONTHS TO SAY

01:12:48.464 --> 01:12:50.833
THE LEAST. I'VE BEEN SITTING ON

01:12:50.899 --> 01:12:52.134
THIS COMMITTEE FOR TWO YEARS

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:54.236
NOW, AND I KNOW AT THE BEGINNING

01:12:54.303 --> 01:12:56.839
WE WERE TALKING AND PREPARING

01:12:56.905 --> 01:12:59.208
AND HAD A LOT OF REPORTS AND

01:12:59.274 --> 01:12:59.808
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE WORST

01:12:59.875 --> 01:13:01.510
CASE SCENARIO. AND THEN THE

01:13:01.577 --> 01:13:03.345
WORST CASE SCENARIO HAPPENED.

01:13:03.412 --> 01:13:05.414
AND I MUST COMMEND YOUR OFFICE

01:13:05.481 --> 01:13:06.815
FOR DOING AN INCREDIBLE JOB

01:13:06.882 --> 01:13:09.418
UNDER VERY DIFFICULT

01:13:09.485 --> 01:13:10.919
CIRCUMSTANCES. I DO HAVE A

01:13:10.986 --> 01:13:12.588
FOLLOW UP QUESTION FROM THE LAST

01:13:12.654 --> 01:13:15.324
TIME YOU WERE HERE TO GIVE US AN

01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:17.726
UPDATE, AND THAT IS RELATED TO

01:13:17.793 --> 01:13:20.195
THE MODERNIZATION OF THE FAIR

01:13:20.262 --> 01:13:23.866
PLAN. AND UNDER THAT PLAN OR THE

01:13:23.932 --> 01:13:27.603
PROCESS OF THAT, YOUR DEPARTMENT

01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:29.538
APPROVED THE ABILITY FOR

01:13:29.605 --> 01:13:32.407
INSURANCE COMPANIES TO RECOUP

01:13:32.474 --> 01:13:35.144
50% OF THE $1 BILLION FROM THE

01:13:35.210 --> 01:13:38.213
FAIR PLAN. AND SO THE QUESTION

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:40.115
THAT I'M ASKING IS RELATED TO

01:13:40.182 --> 01:13:41.850
THE QUESTIONS THAT I GET FROM MY

01:13:41.917 --> 01:13:43.719
CONSTITUENTS CONSISTENTLY, WHICH

01:13:43.786 --> 01:13:45.120
IS HOW MUCH IS THIS GOING TO

01:13:45.187 --> 01:13:48.357
COST ME? SO DO YOU HAVE AN

01:13:48.423 --> 01:13:49.558
UPDATE ON WHEN WE'RE EXPECTING

01:13:49.625 --> 01:13:51.493
THIS TO TAKE EFFECT, AND HOW

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:53.996
MUCH ARE WE EXPECTING

01:13:54.062 --> 01:13:55.931
CONSTITUENTS TO PAY AS THE RATES

01:13:55.998 --> 01:13:57.766
GO UP RIGHT THERE? WELL, THEY

01:13:57.833 --> 01:13:59.501
THE INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE TWO

01:13:59.568 --> 01:14:02.137
YEARS TO RECOUP TO RECOUP THAT

01:14:02.204 --> 01:14:04.506
LOSS. AND WE DON'T HAVE A SET

01:14:04.573 --> 01:14:06.642
FIGURE OR NUMBER JUST BECAUSE

01:14:06.708 --> 01:14:07.843
ONE NOT EVERYBODY HAS AN

01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:09.778
INSURANCE POLICY OR THE

01:14:09.845 --> 01:14:12.981
INSURANCE POLICY IS VERY ARE SO

01:14:13.048 --> 01:14:14.716
VARIED IN DEPENDING ON THE TYPE

01:14:14.783 --> 01:14:16.885
OF POLICY YOU HAVE OR THE TYPE

01:14:16.952 --> 01:14:19.855
OF COVERAGE. AND SO I CAN'T GIVE

01:14:19.922 --> 01:14:21.623
YOU A HARD NUMBER, BUT I'LL TELL

01:14:21.690 --> 01:14:24.059
YOU THAT THE FAIR PLAN IS IN A

01:14:24.126 --> 01:14:25.727
MUCH STRONGER PLACE AS WE ENTER

01:14:25.794 --> 01:14:29.064
WILDFIRE SEASON TO BE TO BETTER

01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:30.666
PROTECT CALIFORNIANS THROUGHOUT

01:14:30.732 --> 01:14:33.202
THE ENTIRE STATE, REGARDLESS OF

01:14:33.268 --> 01:14:34.870
THE MOST DEVASTATING FIRES THAT

01:14:34.937 --> 01:14:37.372
WE'VE HAD TO DATE. AND SO I

01:14:37.439 --> 01:14:40.075
CAN'T GIVE YOU A FIGURE, BUT BUT

01:14:40.142 --> 01:14:42.411
YES, THIS IS ANOTHER PART OF,

01:14:42.477 --> 01:14:44.546
YOU KNOW, THE REALITY OF AND

01:14:44.613 --> 01:14:45.848
THESE ARE CURRENT LAWS, YOU

01:14:45.914 --> 01:14:47.783
KNOW, NOW WHERE RATES CONTINUE

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:49.718
TO GO UP WITHOUT ANY GUARANTEE

01:14:49.785 --> 01:14:51.987
OF COVERAGE. WE'RE CHANGING THAT

01:14:52.054 --> 01:14:54.656
ENTIRE ENTIRE SCHEME. I CAN GIVE

01:14:54.723 --> 01:14:58.227
YOU MORE. WE CAN I CAN GET MY

01:14:58.293 --> 01:14:58.994
FINANCIAL SOLVENCY TEAM TO TALK

01:14:59.061 --> 01:15:00.996
TO THE FAIR PLAN EVERY TWO WEEKS

01:15:01.063 --> 01:15:02.831
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ON PAR

01:15:02.898 --> 01:15:05.367
AND GIVE YOU SOME, SEE IF WE CAN

01:15:05.434 --> 01:15:06.835
MAYBE CARVE OUT SOME SPECIFIC

01:15:06.902 --> 01:15:09.338
DATA. BUT IT'S JUST HARD BECAUSE

01:15:09.404 --> 01:15:11.039
ONE, NOT EVERY CONSUMER HAS

01:15:11.106 --> 01:15:12.674
INSURANCE AND SOME OF THEM MIGHT

01:15:12.741 --> 01:15:14.343
BE UNDERINSURED. SOME OF THEM

01:15:14.409 --> 01:15:16.445
HAVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF

01:15:16.511 --> 01:15:18.013
POLICIES. SO THERE'S NOT ONE SET

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:20.415
NUMBER I CAN GIVE YOU, BUT WE

01:15:20.482 --> 01:15:22.951
CAN TRY TO SEE IF WE CAN COME UP

01:15:23.018 --> 01:15:24.820
WITH SOMETHING. I THINK THAT

01:15:24.887 --> 01:15:25.454
WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT AS WE

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:27.055
CONTINUE THIS PROCESS,

01:15:27.122 --> 01:15:28.490
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO

01:15:28.557 --> 01:15:30.192
ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY.

01:15:30.259 --> 01:15:31.627
IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO

01:15:31.693 --> 01:15:33.462
CONTINUE TO TELL CONSTITUENTS

01:15:33.528 --> 01:15:36.598
THAT CALL INTO OUR OFFICES

01:15:36.665 --> 01:15:38.700
ASKING, YOU KNOW, AND HOW MUCH

01:15:38.767 --> 01:15:40.569
THEIR BILL IS GOING TO BE WHEN

01:15:40.636 --> 01:15:42.170
THEY'RE BARELY MAKING ENDS MEET.

01:15:42.237 --> 01:15:43.805
ABSOLUTELY. SO, YEAH, WHATEVER

01:15:43.872 --> 01:15:46.308
YOU CAN DO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:15:46.375 --> 01:15:47.910
HAVE SOME ASSURANCES AND HAVE

01:15:47.976 --> 01:15:49.645
SOME VISIBILITY INTO WHAT THAT'S

01:15:49.711 --> 01:15:51.813
GOING TO LOOK LIKE. YEAH. NOW,

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:53.615
AND JUST TO ADD TO THAT,

01:15:53.682 --> 01:15:54.983
ASSEMBLYWOMAN, I DON'T I DON'T

01:15:55.050 --> 01:15:56.518
THINK YOU WERE HERE WHEN WE SAID

01:15:56.585 --> 01:15:58.654
THERE ARE NOW THE FAIR PLAN

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:00.455
POSTS ON THEIR WEBSITE, THEIR

01:16:00.522 --> 01:16:01.556
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND THE

01:16:01.623 --> 01:16:02.724
AMOUNT OF POLICY THEY HAVE.

01:16:02.791 --> 01:16:03.992
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAME OUT

01:16:04.059 --> 01:16:05.494
STRICTLY OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE

01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:07.462
WHEN WE WERE ASKING ME FOR MORE

01:16:07.529 --> 01:16:08.997
TRANSPARENCY. AND WE'RE ACTUALLY

01:16:09.064 --> 01:16:12.000
DOING A REVIEW, WE MIGHT AFTER

01:16:12.067 --> 01:16:13.502
OUR, OUR INVESTIGATION, WE MIGHT

01:16:13.568 --> 01:16:15.871
COME BACK TO YOU ALL WITH

01:16:15.938 --> 01:16:16.939
ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY MEASURES

01:16:17.005 --> 01:16:19.074
THAT WE NEED FOR THE FAIR PLAN.

01:16:19.141 --> 01:16:20.609
LIKE I SAID, YOU KNOW, STATES

01:16:20.676 --> 01:16:22.110
THAT HAVE JUST IMPLEMENTED THEIR

01:16:22.177 --> 01:16:23.879
OWN FAIR PLANS ARE MUCH MORE

01:16:23.946 --> 01:16:25.047
TRANSPARENT THAN OURS. THAT WAS

01:16:25.113 --> 01:16:26.682
DONE IN THE 60S. SO WE'RE DOING

01:16:26.748 --> 01:16:29.217
A THOROUGH REVIEW TO MAKE SURE,

01:16:29.284 --> 01:16:30.852
AGAIN, THAT WE ARE THAT THE FAIR

01:16:30.919 --> 01:16:33.255
PLAN IS AS TRANSPARENT AS

01:16:33.322 --> 01:16:36.024
POSSIBLE AND THAT CONSUMERS

01:16:36.091 --> 01:16:37.592
UNDERSTAND, YOU KNOW, IT'S THE

01:16:37.659 --> 01:16:39.361
SAME THING THAT HAPPENED AFTER

01:16:39.428 --> 01:16:41.096
THE SANTA ROSA FIRE, THE

01:16:41.163 --> 01:16:42.564
CAMPFIRE. PEOPLE IN SOUTHERN

01:16:42.631 --> 01:16:44.066
CALIFORNIA WERE CALLING IN

01:16:44.132 --> 01:16:46.101
ASKING, HOW MUCH IS THIS GOING

01:16:46.168 --> 01:16:47.636
TO COST ME? AND SO I WOULD JUST

01:16:47.703 --> 01:16:49.237
TELL YOU, WE'RE ALL IN THIS

01:16:49.304 --> 01:16:50.272
TOGETHER. THESE FIRES ARE

01:16:50.339 --> 01:16:51.073
HAPPENING THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE

01:16:51.139 --> 01:16:53.342
STATE. WE NEED A HEALTHY, FAIR

01:16:53.408 --> 01:16:55.277
PLAN THAT I THINK WE NOW ARE

01:16:55.344 --> 01:16:56.611
GETTING ON THE ROAD TO BEING

01:16:56.678 --> 01:16:58.747
THERE. NOW, LET'S GET THEM TO BE

01:16:58.814 --> 01:17:00.916
TRANSPARENT SO THAT WE ALL

01:17:00.983 --> 01:17:01.616
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE FINANCIAL

01:17:01.683 --> 01:17:03.051
CONDITION OF THE FAIR PLAN IS,

01:17:03.118 --> 01:17:05.487
AND IF IT'S READY TO MEET THE

01:17:05.554 --> 01:17:09.424
NEXT CATASTROPHE. AND SO THOSE

01:17:09.491 --> 01:17:11.460
ARE THE BALANCES THAT WE WE'RE

01:17:11.526 --> 01:17:12.961
TRYING TO DO HERE.

01:17:13.028 --> 01:17:14.896
ASSEMBLYWOMAN. WELL, THANK YOU

01:17:14.963 --> 01:17:17.933
SO MUCH, COMMISSIONER. I REALLY

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:18.900
APPRECIATE THE AMOUNT OF TIME

01:17:18.967 --> 01:17:20.702
THAT YOU HAVE SPENT WITH THIS

01:17:20.769 --> 01:17:22.971
COMMITTEE, AS WELL AS YOUR

01:17:23.038 --> 01:17:23.839
COLLABORATION WITH OTHER

01:17:23.905 --> 01:17:25.474
INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS. I THINK

01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:27.376
IT REALLY SPEAKS TO THE POWER OF

01:17:27.442 --> 01:17:29.644
THE STATES AND HOW WE CAN SOLVE

01:17:29.711 --> 01:17:32.147
PROBLEMS. I JUST HAVE A COUPLE

01:17:32.214 --> 01:17:33.648
QUESTIONS, AND I THINK YOU'VE

01:17:33.715 --> 01:17:36.184
DONE A LOT OF WORK. BUT IF I'M A

01:17:36.251 --> 01:17:38.320
HOMEOWNER AND I'M THINKING ABOUT

01:17:38.387 --> 01:17:41.590
THE CCU FIRES IN 2020 AND SANTA

01:17:41.656 --> 01:17:43.358
CRUZ COUNTY, I'M THINKING ABOUT

01:17:43.425 --> 01:17:47.262
THE 2025 FIRES THAT WERE

01:17:47.329 --> 01:17:49.164
DEVASTATING IN LOS ANGELES.

01:17:49.231 --> 01:17:51.366
WHAT'S DIFFERENT NOW? YOU KNOW,

01:17:51.433 --> 01:17:53.168
KNOWING FIRE SEASON IS COMING.

01:17:53.235 --> 01:17:54.669
LIKE AS A HOMEOWNER, WHAT WOULD

01:17:54.736 --> 01:17:57.472
I EXPERIENCE DIFFERENTLY NOW AND

01:17:57.539 --> 01:17:59.875
THEN? WHAT WILL I EXPERIENCE

01:17:59.941 --> 01:18:02.244
DIFFERENTLY OR A RENTER? BUT YOU

01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:03.445
KNOW, SOMEBODY WHO'S GOING TO

01:18:03.512 --> 01:18:05.247
LIVE THROUGH THESE FIRES. WHAT'S

01:18:05.313 --> 01:18:07.349
DIFFERENT NOW COMPARED TO 2020

01:18:07.416 --> 01:18:09.651
COMPARED TO JANUARY 2025, AND

01:18:09.718 --> 01:18:11.486
WHAT'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT

01:18:11.553 --> 01:18:13.622
ONCE THE SUSTAINABLE PLAN IS IN

01:18:13.688 --> 01:18:16.124
PLACE? THAT ALL EXPERIENCE, JUST

01:18:16.191 --> 01:18:17.926
AS A, YOU KNOW, INSURANCE

01:18:17.993 --> 01:18:19.094
CONSUMER, I GUESS I'LL SAY I

01:18:19.161 --> 01:18:20.962
THINK WE ARE IN A MUCH BETTER

01:18:21.029 --> 01:18:22.531
PLACE. ONE, GIVEN THE LEADERSHIP

01:18:22.597 --> 01:18:25.100
YOU ALL HAVE SHOWN WITH THE

01:18:25.167 --> 01:18:27.369
CRITICAL INVESTMENTS AROUND

01:18:27.436 --> 01:18:28.503
MITIGATION, OBVIOUSLY THERE'S

01:18:28.570 --> 01:18:30.539
MORE TO DO BECAUSE WE'RE STILL

01:18:30.605 --> 01:18:35.077
SEEING THAT CONSUMERS ARE ONE.

01:18:35.143 --> 01:18:36.278
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE NOT GETTING

01:18:36.344 --> 01:18:39.614
THE CREDIT FOR THE, THE WORK

01:18:39.681 --> 01:18:41.683
THEY'RE DOING. WE'RE ALSO NOW

01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:43.118
INVESTIGATING AND LOOKING AT THE

01:18:43.185 --> 01:18:44.453
DISCOUNTS THAT WE STARTED. AS

01:18:44.519 --> 01:18:46.088
THESE DISCOUNTS ARE MATURING,

01:18:46.154 --> 01:18:46.855
WE'RE SEEING THAT THEY'RE

01:18:46.922 --> 01:18:48.924
STARTING TO GROW BECAUSE NOW

01:18:48.990 --> 01:18:50.292
INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE TAKING

01:18:50.358 --> 01:18:52.527
MORE ACCOUNT AND UNDERSTAND THAT

01:18:52.594 --> 01:18:54.362
MITIGATION IS KEY. SO OVER TIME,

01:18:54.429 --> 01:18:56.164
WE ALWAYS KNEW THAT THE

01:18:56.231 --> 01:18:56.898
INSURANCE COMPANIES WERE FIRST

01:18:56.965 --> 01:18:59.334
GOING TO BE HESITANT TO GIVE BIG

01:18:59.401 --> 01:19:00.135
DISCOUNTS. NOW WE'RE STARTING TO

01:19:00.202 --> 01:19:01.837
SEE THAT GROW, BECAUSE THERE'S

01:19:01.903 --> 01:19:03.672
NOW A COMMON KNOWLEDGE THAT

01:19:03.738 --> 01:19:06.241
THESE WORK. WE ALSO STILL HAVE

01:19:06.308 --> 01:19:08.443
TO GET MONEY IN PEOPLE'S POCKET

01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:10.345
TO DO THE MOST EXPENSIVE PART OF

01:19:10.412 --> 01:19:12.848
THE WORK, WHICH IS THE ROOF

01:19:12.914 --> 01:19:15.050
PROTECTING PEOPLE'S ROOFS, THE

01:19:15.117 --> 01:19:16.518
SHUTTER AND THE SURROUNDING

01:19:16.585 --> 01:19:18.420
COMMUNITY. WHY? SOME OF CALDERON

01:19:18.487 --> 01:19:21.990
BILL IS PARAMOUNT, AND I THINK

01:19:22.057 --> 01:19:24.159
WE HAVE TO, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO

01:19:24.226 --> 01:19:25.527
JUST BITE THE BULLET AND INVEST

01:19:25.594 --> 01:19:28.029
IN THAT. WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO

01:19:28.096 --> 01:19:29.598
SEE IN THIS MONTH IS YOU'RE

01:19:29.664 --> 01:19:31.199
GOING TO SEE INSURANCE COMPANIES

01:19:31.266 --> 01:19:33.568
FILE THEIR RATE FILINGS WITH THE

01:19:33.635 --> 01:19:35.137
UNDER THE NEW RULES, WHERE THEY

01:19:35.203 --> 01:19:36.771
GET TO USE THESE TWO TOOLS. AND

01:19:36.838 --> 01:19:39.040
NOW WE GET THE GUARANTEE THAT

01:19:39.107 --> 01:19:40.442
INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE TO GROW

01:19:40.509 --> 01:19:42.511
IN THESE AREAS. SO AND WE'RE

01:19:42.577 --> 01:19:45.680
GOING TO BE ABLE NOW TO HAVE THE

01:19:45.747 --> 01:19:47.215
TECHNOLOGY TO BE ABLE TO SHOW

01:19:47.282 --> 01:19:48.683
YOU WHERE INSURANCE COMPANIES

01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:50.485
ARE WRITING IN YOUR DISTRICT,

01:19:50.552 --> 01:19:52.220
WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT AS A

01:19:52.287 --> 01:19:53.155
FORMER LEGISLATOR, I WOULD HAVE

01:19:53.221 --> 01:19:55.891
LOVED TO HAVE HAD. AND SO WE'LL

01:19:55.957 --> 01:19:58.326
BE ABLE TO TRACK THAT AND

01:19:58.393 --> 01:20:00.562
MONITOR THAT SO THAT WE ALSO CAN

01:20:00.629 --> 01:20:03.064
SEE IF IT'S NOT HAPPENING. WHY

01:20:03.131 --> 01:20:04.499
IS THAT NOT HAPPENING? HOW ARE

01:20:04.566 --> 01:20:06.635

OUR POLICY OR LOOK AT WHAT WE

01:20:18.547 --> 01:20:20.115

01:23:08.850 --> 01:23:10.618
COUNTY, DIFFERENT COUNTY HEALTH

01:23:10.685 --> 01:23:12.220
OFFICERS HAVE DIFFERENT

01:23:12.287 --> 01:23:13.254
SUGGESTIONS. SO WE'RE GOING TO

01:23:13.321 --> 01:23:14.723
BRING THAT ALL TOGETHER. AGAIN,

01:23:14.789 --> 01:23:16.624
IT TOOK US A WHILE BECAUSE WE

01:23:16.691 --> 01:23:18.293
WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHEN

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:19.794
DO THEY EXIST? ARE THERE WHO ARE

01:23:19.861 --> 01:23:21.496
THE EXPERTS IN THIS FIELD?

01:23:21.563 --> 01:23:22.831
THAT'S CLEARLY NOT OUR

01:23:22.897 --> 01:23:25.066
EXPERTISE. AND SEEING AN ABSENCE

01:23:25.133 --> 01:23:26.067
IN THAT. WE JUST BROUGHT

01:23:26.134 --> 01:23:26.901
EVERYBODY TOGETHER AND WE'RE

01:23:26.968 --> 01:23:28.770
GOING TO TRY TO GET THAT. WE

01:23:28.837 --> 01:23:31.272
WILL GET THAT DONE IN A COUPLE

01:23:31.339 --> 01:23:32.874
OF MONTHS. THANK YOU FOR THAT.

01:23:32.941 --> 01:23:34.142
AND THANK YOU FOR PREVIEWING MY

01:23:34.209 --> 01:23:34.776
QUESTION ON UNDERINSURANCE. AND

01:23:34.843 --> 01:23:36.778
COULD YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:23:36.845 --> 01:23:40.181
ABOUT HOW THAT DOES FIT IN WITH

01:23:40.248 --> 01:23:42.550
THE SUSTAINABLE PLAN, OR WILL

01:23:42.617 --> 01:23:44.686
DOVETAIL OR PARALLEL? MY BIG

01:23:44.753 --> 01:23:46.788
CONCERN AROUND UNDERINSURANCE IS

01:23:46.855 --> 01:23:48.523
RIGHT NOW WE'RE HAVING THE VERY

01:23:48.590 --> 01:23:50.058
IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AROUND,

01:23:50.125 --> 01:23:54.062
CAN PEOPLE GET INSURANCE OR NOT?

01:23:54.129 --> 01:23:55.797
MY BIG FEAR, AND WHAT I'VE HEARD

01:23:55.864 --> 01:23:57.599
FROM FOLKS ON THE CENTRAL COAST

01:23:57.665 --> 01:23:59.334
IS THEY CAN GET INSURANCE, BUT

01:23:59.401 --> 01:24:00.835
IT'S SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH

01:24:00.902 --> 01:24:01.903
INSURANCE. AND THE CHRONICLE HAD

01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:05.240
A HUGE ARTICLE AROUND INSURANCE

01:24:05.306 --> 01:24:07.375
COMPANIES USING CERTAIN

01:24:07.442 --> 01:24:09.210
DATABASES OR SYSTEMS THAT WERE

01:24:09.277 --> 01:24:10.512
PREDICTING WHAT, YOU KNOW, WHAT

01:24:10.578 --> 01:24:11.913
LEVEL OF INSURANCE PEOPLE NEED,

01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:13.848
AND THAT THEY WERE VERY FAULTY,

01:24:13.915 --> 01:24:16.017
AND THAT WE'VE HAD THESE HUGE

01:24:16.084 --> 01:24:18.086
FIRES IN THE PAST WHERE PEOPLE

01:24:18.153 --> 01:24:20.388
SIMPLY DID NOT GET THE KIND OF

01:24:20.455 --> 01:24:21.823
INSURANCE, DIDN'T HAVE THE

01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:22.690
INSURANCE THAT THEY NEEDED TO

01:24:22.757 --> 01:24:24.492
BE, EVEN IF THEY ASKED FOR

01:24:24.559 --> 01:24:25.326
ADDITIONAL COVERAGE THEY ASKED

01:24:25.393 --> 01:24:26.861
FOR. SO THAT'S PART OF WILLING

01:24:26.928 --> 01:24:28.596
TO PAY. THAT'S PART OF OUR

01:24:28.663 --> 01:24:29.931
INVESTIGATION. LOOKING AT WE'VE

01:24:29.998 --> 01:24:32.133
GOTTEN SOME OF THE COMPLAINTS.

01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:33.802
AGAIN, IF YOU KNOW FOLKS THAT

01:24:33.868 --> 01:24:34.836
HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS, PLEASE

01:24:34.903 --> 01:24:37.038
FILE A ACTUALLY FILE A COMPLAINT

01:24:37.105 --> 01:24:38.106
WITH THE DEPARTMENT, BECAUSE AS

01:24:38.173 --> 01:24:39.707
WE'RE DOING THIS INVESTIGATIONS,

01:24:39.774 --> 01:24:41.943
WE USE, YOU KNOW, THAT REAL TIME

01:24:42.010 --> 01:24:43.711
COMPLAINT PROCESS TO REVIEW

01:24:43.778 --> 01:24:47.282
THOSE. AND WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT

01:24:47.348 --> 01:24:49.517
FOR US, IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT WHEN

01:24:49.584 --> 01:24:51.553
ALL THE ALL THIS MONEY GETS

01:24:51.619 --> 01:24:53.855
COLLECTED TO HELP SUPPORT

01:24:53.922 --> 01:24:54.489
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

01:24:54.556 --> 01:24:55.890
UNDERINSURED OR NOT INSURED.

01:24:55.957 --> 01:24:57.826
THERE'S NO DATA TO UNDERSTAND

01:24:57.892 --> 01:24:59.828
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE AND WHO ARE

01:24:59.894 --> 01:25:01.663
THESE FOLKS AND WHERE THEY LIVE.

01:25:01.729 --> 01:25:04.165
AND SO THAT'S A BIG THING THAT

01:25:04.232 --> 01:25:04.966
WE'VE SEEN IN COLORADO, NEW

01:25:05.033 --> 01:25:06.701
MEXICO, WASHINGTON AND OREGON.

01:25:06.768 --> 01:25:09.037
AND SO WE JUST WE'RE GOING TO

01:25:09.103 --> 01:25:11.105
COMPILE OUR RESOURCES, DO A DATA

01:25:11.172 --> 01:25:13.575
SHARING. AND OUR TEAMS HAVE BEEN

01:25:13.641 --> 01:25:14.909
MEETING NOW FOR A COUPLE OF

01:25:14.976 --> 01:25:16.911
MONTHS TO TRY TO WORK ON ONE.

01:25:16.978 --> 01:25:18.480
CAN WE WORK ON SOME SORT OF

01:25:18.546 --> 01:25:20.849
EITHER MODEL LAW AT THE NATIONAL

01:25:20.915 --> 01:25:22.450
LEVEL, OR WHAT REGULATORY

01:25:22.517 --> 01:25:24.786
REFORMS WE NEED TO MAKE, OR WHAT

01:25:24.853 --> 01:25:27.322
DATA DO WE NEED TO ASK INSURANCE

01:25:27.388 --> 01:25:29.157
COMPANIES TO HELP US TRIANGULATE

01:25:29.224 --> 01:25:31.826
HOW WE UNDERSTAND WHO'S INSURED,

01:25:31.893 --> 01:25:34.095
WHO'S UNDERINSURED? AND SO WE'RE

01:25:34.162 --> 01:25:36.731
LOOKING AT WE GOT THE BEST MINDS

01:25:41.603 --> 01:25:42.637

ALWAYS APPRECIATE YOU COMING. I

01:26:09.130 --> 01:26:11.332
THINK IT'S HELPFUL FOR US TO

01:26:11.399 --> 01:26:12.834
HEAR WHERE YOU'RE AT AND ALL THE

01:26:12.901 --> 01:26:14.769
GREAT THINGS YOU'RE DOING TO

01:26:14.836 --> 01:26:16.538
HELP CALIFORNIANS. IS THERE

01:26:16.604 --> 01:26:18.806
ANYTHING THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO

01:26:18.873 --> 01:26:21.509
TO HELP YOU GET OUR BILL PACKAGE

01:26:21.576 --> 01:26:23.378
DONE, GET THEM FUNDED? I KNOW

01:26:23.444 --> 01:26:26.581
IT'S A DIFFICULT HAVING HAVING

01:26:26.648 --> 01:26:29.918
HAVE COME IN IN 2010 UNDER A

01:26:29.984 --> 01:26:32.287
MASSIVE BUDGET CUT SEASON. I, I,

01:26:32.353 --> 01:26:34.756
I FEEL YOU AND NOW IT'S WHERE

01:26:34.822 --> 01:26:36.491
THE MAGIC HAPPENS. BUT THESE ARE

01:26:36.558 --> 01:26:37.759
IMPORTANT INVESTMENTS THAT WE

01:26:37.825 --> 01:26:40.261
NEED TO MAKE. WE CAN'T MAKE THE

01:26:40.328 --> 01:26:42.130
SAME MISTAKES WE'VE MET, WE'VE

01:26:42.196 --> 01:26:44.933
MADE IN THE PAST. WE ALSO HAVE

01:26:44.999 --> 01:26:46.534
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION. AS I

01:26:46.601 --> 01:26:48.703
KNOW WE FINALLY ARE DOING SOME

01:26:48.770 --> 01:26:50.371
STRIDES AROUND SCHOOL REFORM,

01:26:50.438 --> 01:26:52.941
THAT WE ALSO LOOK AT LOCAL

01:26:53.007 --> 01:26:55.410
PLANNING, BUILDING CODE UPGRADES

01:26:55.476 --> 01:26:58.212
AND ALL OF THAT IMPACTS NOT JUST

01:26:58.279 --> 01:27:01.182
FIRE, EARTHQUAKE, SEA LEVEL

01:27:01.249 --> 01:27:04.819
RISE, EXTREME HEAT AND

01:27:04.886 --> 01:27:05.720
ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS. WHEN IT

01:27:05.787 --> 01:27:08.690
COMES TO INLAND FLOODING. SO I

01:27:08.756 --> 01:27:10.825
WOULD JUST SAY WE CAN'T LOOK AT

01:27:10.892 --> 01:27:13.227
JUST ONE SOLUTION NOW FOR ONE

01:27:13.294 --> 01:27:15.697
PERIL. WE NEED TO LOOK AT ONE

01:27:15.763 --> 01:27:17.599
SOLUTION THAT CAN TRY TO ADDRESS

01:27:17.665 --> 01:27:18.866
MULTIPLE PERILS, BECAUSE

01:27:18.933 --> 01:27:20.268
UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S WHERE WE'RE

01:27:20.335 --> 01:27:21.102
HEADING. WE'RE GOING TO HEAD TO

01:27:21.169 --> 01:27:22.804
A POINT WHERE WE'RE GOING TO

01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:24.639
HAVE A FIRE IN A CERTAIN PART OF

01:27:24.706 --> 01:27:26.841
THE STATE, WE MIGHT HAVE AN

01:27:26.908 --> 01:27:27.475
EARTHQUAKE IN ANOTHER PART, AND

01:27:27.542 --> 01:27:29.410
WE MIGHT HAVE A CERTAIN PART,

01:27:29.477 --> 01:27:30.278
YOU KNOW, FLOODING. AND SO,

01:27:30.345 --> 01:27:33.881
AGAIN, WHY ORTEGA'S QUESTION IS

01:27:33.948 --> 01:27:35.450
CRITICAL IS THE FAIR PLAY, IS

01:27:35.516 --> 01:27:37.518
OUR FAIR PLAN GOING TO BE ABLE

01:27:37.585 --> 01:27:38.953
TO MEET A MOMENT LIKE THAT WHEN

01:27:39.020 --> 01:27:41.022
MULTIPLE CATASTROPHES ARE

01:27:41.089 --> 01:27:43.157
HAPPENING? AND THIS IS WHY WE

01:27:43.224 --> 01:27:45.193
NEED TO MODERNIZE IT, HAVE IT BE

01:27:45.259 --> 01:27:46.127
TRANSPARENT SO THAT WE'RE ALL

01:27:46.194 --> 01:27:47.895
COMING IN, EYES OPEN ON WHAT WE

01:27:47.962 --> 01:27:50.865
NEED TO DO TO FIX IT. SO I WOULD

01:27:50.932 --> 01:27:52.834
SAY THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS

01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:53.901
THAT WE'RE WE'RE STARTING TO

01:27:53.968 --> 01:27:55.903
LOOK AT INTERNATIONALLY,

01:27:55.970 --> 01:27:58.039
NATIONALLY. BUT THIS BILL

01:27:58.106 --> 01:27:59.674
PACKAGE, LIKE I SAID, IF WE HAD

01:27:59.741 --> 01:28:01.643
THAT BILL THAT WE INTRODUCED A

01:28:01.709 --> 01:28:02.977
COUPLE YEARS AGO, THE FAIR PLAN

01:28:03.044 --> 01:28:04.812
WOULD HAVE HAD ADDITIONAL, YOU

01:28:04.879 --> 01:28:07.849
KNOW, ACCESS TO MONEY. RIGHT? SO

01:28:07.915 --> 01:28:09.684
LET'S JUST LET'S, LET'S DO THE

01:28:09.751 --> 01:28:10.551
HARD WORK, WHAT YOU ALL ARE

01:28:10.618 --> 01:28:12.920
DOING. SO AGAIN, JUST LET YOU

01:28:12.987 --> 01:28:14.956
KNOW WE'LL BE READY BY THE END

01:28:15.023 --> 01:28:16.824
OF THIS MONTH. AND WE'LL BE ABLE

01:28:16.891 --> 01:28:17.725

01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:46.380
COMMISSIONER'S LEADERSHIP AND

01:29:46.447 --> 01:29:48.116
THE HARD WORK OF ALL THE

01:29:48.182 --> 01:29:48.783
STAKEHOLDERS, BECAUSE THERE HAVE

01:29:48.850 --> 01:29:50.785
BEEN MANY INVOLVED IN DEVELOPING

01:29:50.852 --> 01:29:52.453
THE SUSTAINABLE INSURANCE

01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:54.589
STRATEGY, OR SIS. WE VIEW THIS

01:29:54.655 --> 01:29:56.457
AS A COMPREHENSIVE INITIATIVE TO

01:29:56.524 --> 01:29:58.259
ADDRESS THE STATE'S INSURANCE

01:29:58.326 --> 01:30:00.094
CRISIS BY, AS THE COMMISSIONER

01:30:00.161 --> 01:30:01.863
NOTED, MODERNIZING THE RATE

01:30:01.929 --> 01:30:03.898
APPROVAL PROCESS, INCENTIVIZING

01:30:03.965 --> 01:30:05.800
RISK REDUCTION, AND PROMOTING A

01:30:05.867 --> 01:30:08.736
MORE RELIABLE INSURANCE MARKET.

01:30:08.803 --> 01:30:10.805
IT'S NOT BEEN AN EASY TASK. IT'S

01:30:10.872 --> 01:30:12.673
TAKEN ALMOST TWO YEARS TO GET

01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:13.841
ALL THE PIECES IN PLACE, AND

01:30:13.908 --> 01:30:15.209
THERE'S STILL AN OUTSTANDING

01:30:15.276 --> 01:30:17.745
COMPONENT RELATED TO THE

01:30:17.812 --> 01:30:19.881
APPROVAL TIMEFRAME FOR RATE

01:30:19.947 --> 01:30:21.415
FILINGS THAT'S EXPECTED AT THE

01:30:21.482 --> 01:30:22.984
END OF THIS YEAR. HOWEVER,

01:30:23.050 --> 01:30:23.918
AGAIN, AS THE COMMISSIONER

01:30:23.985 --> 01:30:25.353
TALKED ABOUT, WE HAVE SEVERAL

01:30:25.419 --> 01:30:26.621
MEMBER COMPANIES THAT ARE

01:30:26.687 --> 01:30:29.190
ALREADY ENGAGED IN MAKING THE

01:30:29.257 --> 01:30:31.759
RATE FILING PROCESS, AND WE'RE

01:30:31.826 --> 01:30:33.060
OPTIMISTIC THAT THIS WILL RESULT

01:30:33.127 --> 01:30:34.729
IN A MORE STABLE INSURANCE

01:30:34.796 --> 01:30:36.097
MARKET AND PROVIDE GREATER

01:30:36.164 --> 01:30:37.398
INSURANCE AVAILABILITY ACROSS

01:30:37.465 --> 01:30:39.300
THE STATE. THAT'S OUR SHARED

01:30:39.367 --> 01:30:41.636
GOAL, AND PIF IS COMMITTED TO

01:30:41.702 --> 01:30:44.138
BEING A FULL PARTNER IN THAT

01:30:44.205 --> 01:30:49.911
PROCESS. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR

01:30:49.977 --> 01:30:51.012
MEMBERS DENNY REUTER HERE ON

01:30:51.078 --> 01:30:53.014
BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PROPERTY

01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:54.448
CASUALTY INSURANCE ASSOCIATION,

01:30:54.515 --> 01:30:56.784
WE JUST WANT TO EXPRESS OUR

01:30:56.851 --> 01:30:58.085
APPRECIATION FOR THE CONTINUED

01:30:58.152 --> 01:31:00.221
FOCUS OF THIS COMMITTEE AND THE

01:31:00.288 --> 01:31:03.124
LEGISLATURE IN ENSURING THAT THE

01:31:03.191 --> 01:31:04.926
MARKET DIFFICULTIES ARE BEING

01:31:04.992 --> 01:31:06.360
ADDRESSED HEAD ON. WE REALLY DO

01:31:06.427 --> 01:31:07.728
APPRECIATE THE FOCUS, THE

01:31:07.795 --> 01:31:09.964
QUESTIONS FROM THIS COMMITTEE. I

01:31:10.031 --> 01:31:11.365
ALSO WANT TO EXPRESS

01:31:11.432 --> 01:31:12.967
APPRECIATION TO THE DEPARTMENT

01:31:13.034 --> 01:31:14.635
FOR ALL OF THE WORK THAT THEY'VE

01:31:14.702 --> 01:31:16.470
PUT INTO THIS OVER THE LAST FEW

01:31:16.537 --> 01:31:18.639
YEARS. WE DO HAVE SEVERAL MEMBER

01:31:18.706 --> 01:31:20.842
COMPANIES THAT ARE EXCITED TO

01:31:20.908 --> 01:31:21.943
UTILIZE THESE REFORMS, AND IT

01:31:22.009 --> 01:31:24.011
SOUNDS LIKE MAYBE AT THE END OF

01:31:24.078 --> 01:31:25.012
THIS MONTH THEY'LL HAVE ACCESS

01:31:25.079 --> 01:31:26.881
TO THAT. AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD

01:31:26.948 --> 01:31:29.784
TO THAT. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO

01:31:29.851 --> 01:31:31.018
EMPHASIZE THAT THE SUCCESS OF

01:31:31.085 --> 01:31:32.653
THE SUSTAINABLE INSURANCE

01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:34.755
STRATEGY, I THINK THERE ARE TWO

01:31:34.822 --> 01:31:37.258
FACTORS THAT WILL REALLY BE

01:31:37.325 --> 01:31:39.861
REALLY PREDICTIVE OF HERE. ONE

01:31:39.927 --> 01:31:41.596
WOULD BE THE TIMELINESS OF THE

01:31:41.662 --> 01:31:43.431
RATE FILING PROCESS. YOU KNOW,

01:31:43.497 --> 01:31:44.565
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT

01:31:44.632 --> 01:31:47.368
INSURERS ARE ABLE TO GET THE

01:31:47.435 --> 01:31:48.769
RATE THAT REFLECTS THE RISK THAT

01:31:48.836 --> 01:31:49.937
THEY'RE COVERING. AND I THINK

01:31:50.004 --> 01:31:51.472
THAT WILL GO A LONG WAY TO

01:31:51.539 --> 01:31:52.506
ADDRESSING SOME OF THE

01:31:52.573 --> 01:31:55.009
AVAILABILITY CONCERNS THAT YOUR

01:31:55.076 --> 01:31:55.743
CONSTITUENTS ARE EXPERIENCING.

01:31:55.810 --> 01:32:00.314
AND THE OTHER FACTOR IS THE

01:32:00.381 --> 01:32:01.949
SOLVENCY AND THE RATE ADEQUACY

01:32:02.016 --> 01:32:04.785
OF THE FAIR PLAN, HAVING

01:32:04.852 --> 01:32:06.587
ENSURING THAT THE FAIR PLAN HAS

01:32:06.654 --> 01:32:09.457
ENOUGH IN RESERVES TO COVER ITS

01:32:09.523 --> 01:32:11.425
EXPOSURE, AND THAT IT IS PRICED

01:32:11.492 --> 01:32:13.694
IN A MANNER THAT IT IS NOT

01:32:13.761 --> 01:32:14.462
COMPETITIVE WITH. THE ADMITTED

01:32:14.528 --> 01:32:15.796
MARKET, IS REALLY GOING TO BE

01:32:15.863 --> 01:32:17.465
CRUCIAL FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE

01:32:17.531 --> 01:32:19.133
SUSTAINABLE INSURANCE STRATEGY.

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:20.768
AND WITH THAT, WE JUST THANK YOU

01:32:20.835 --> 01:32:22.703
ALL FOR YOUR PATIENCE. THERE'S

01:32:22.770 --> 01:32:24.238
BEEN PATIENCE ALL IN ALL

01:32:24.305 --> 01:32:25.773
DIRECTIONS ON THIS. IT HAS TAKEN

01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:27.408
US YEARS TO GET INTO THIS

01:32:27.475 --> 01:32:30.077
SITUATION AND IT'S NOT GOING TO

01:32:30.144 --> 01:32:31.379
BE FIXED OVERNIGHT. SO WE DO

01:32:31.445 --> 01:32:32.713
APPRECIATE SOME LEVEL OF GRACE

01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:35.082
THERE, AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO

01:32:35.149 --> 01:32:36.284
THE SUSTAINABLE INSURANCE

01:32:36.350 --> 01:32:37.919
STRATEGY AND THE SUCCESS OF THAT

01:32:37.985 --> 01:32:40.755
HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THE

01:32:40.821 --> 01:32:41.956
INSURANCE INDUSTRY NEEDS THIS TO

01:32:42.023 --> 01:32:44.659
WORK AS WELL. SO WE LOOK FORWARD

01:32:44.725 --> 01:32:47.261
TO WORKING WITH YOU ALL ON THAT.

01:32:47.328 --> 01:32:53.501
THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR AND

01:32:53.567 --> 01:32:55.870
MEMBERS. MR. VICE CHAIR, I JUST

01:32:55.937 --> 01:32:57.138
WANT TO SAY, DAN DONMOYER,

01:32:57.204 --> 01:32:57.905
PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE

01:32:57.972 --> 01:32:59.006

01:32:59.073 --> 01:33:01.108
THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY

01:33:01.175 --> 01:33:04.078
ASSOCIATION. I JUST WANTED TO

01:33:04.145 --> 01:33:04.879
EXPRESS APPRECIATION FIRST TO

01:33:04.946 --> 01:33:06.714
YOU, MADAM CHAIR, FOR THE FOCUS

01:33:06.781 --> 01:33:08.749
OF THIS ISSUE ON BEHALF OF THE

01:33:08.816 --> 01:33:10.484
BUSINESS COMMUNITY. THAT'S THE

01:33:10.551 --> 01:33:12.820
CONSUMER COMMUNITY. THIS IS JUST

01:33:12.887 --> 01:33:14.555
A REALLY PROFOUND ISSUE. WE HAVE

01:33:14.622 --> 01:33:15.990
STOPPED BUILDING CONDOS IN THE

01:33:16.057 --> 01:33:18.125
STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF

01:33:18.192 --> 01:33:20.494
THIS CRISIS. WE ESTIMATE THAT 30

01:33:20.561 --> 01:33:22.530
TO 40,000 CONDOS WERE NOT BUILT

01:33:22.596 --> 01:33:23.798
IN THE LAST TWO YEARS BECAUSE OF

01:33:23.864 --> 01:33:25.633
THE LACK OF COMMERCIAL

01:33:25.700 --> 01:33:27.168
HABITATIONAL RISK INSURANCE.

01:33:27.234 --> 01:33:28.903
THIS IS THE MOST ATTAINABLE AND

01:33:28.970 --> 01:33:31.472
AFFORDABLE INSURANCE AND

01:33:31.539 --> 01:33:32.473
CONSUMER HOMEOWNER'S PRODUCT

01:33:32.540 --> 01:33:34.008
THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE. AND

01:33:34.075 --> 01:33:35.576
THAT'S ON HOLD. SO WE APPLAUD

01:33:35.643 --> 01:33:37.378
THE COMMISSIONER FOR HIS

01:33:37.445 --> 01:33:38.212
LEADERSHIP ON THE SUSTAINABLE

01:33:38.279 --> 01:33:40.548
INSURANCE STRATEGY. WE

01:33:40.614 --> 01:33:41.115
APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE'S

01:33:41.182 --> 01:33:43.351
SUPPORT. AND YOU, MADAM CHAIR,

01:33:43.417 --> 01:33:46.220
BOTH MR. ALVAREZ CO-SPONSORING

01:33:46.287 --> 01:33:48.723
COAUTHORING AB 226 TO ADDRESS

01:33:48.789 --> 01:33:50.157
THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF THE

01:33:50.224 --> 01:33:52.393
FAIR PLAN IS VERY IMPORTANT. ON

01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:53.794
A VERY POSITIVE NOTE, WE'VE BEEN

01:33:53.861 --> 01:33:54.895
WORKING CLOSELY WITH THIS

01:33:54.962 --> 01:33:55.896
COMMITTEE AND THE COMMISSIONER

01:33:55.963 --> 01:33:58.199
ON EXPANDING THE FAIR PLAN TO

01:33:58.265 --> 01:34:00.334
INCLUDE MORE COVERAGE FOR

01:34:00.401 --> 01:34:02.269
CONDOS, FOR APARTMENTS AND FOR

01:34:02.336 --> 01:34:03.404
LEGALLY DEFINED AFFORDABLE

01:34:03.471 --> 01:34:05.306
HOUSING. WE BELIEVE THAT'S GOING

01:34:05.373 --> 01:34:07.775
TO HAPPEN ON JULY 26TH OF THIS

01:34:07.842 --> 01:34:09.643
MONTH, WHICH WILL ALLOW US, WE

01:34:09.710 --> 01:34:11.445
HOPE, TO COME BACK INTO THIS

01:34:11.512 --> 01:34:13.214
MARKET AND TO SERVE CONSUMERS.

01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:15.282
LAST THING I JUST WANT TO SAY IN

01:34:15.349 --> 01:34:16.550
THE CONTEXT OF THIS ISSUE, WE

01:34:16.617 --> 01:34:17.985
ARE THE CONSUMERS OF THIS

01:34:18.052 --> 01:34:19.186
PRODUCT. SO WE REALLY RESPECT

01:34:19.253 --> 01:34:20.755
THE COMMISSIONER'S CONCERN ABOUT

01:34:20.821 --> 01:34:22.957
THOSE WHO CLAIM TO REPRESENT

01:34:23.024 --> 01:34:25.292
CONSUMERS VERSUS THOSE OF US WHO

01:34:25.359 --> 01:34:25.893
WRITE 100,000 CHECKS A YEAR.

01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:27.695
THAT'S HOW MANY NEW HOUSING

01:34:27.762 --> 01:34:29.196
UNITS WE BUILD THROUGH OUR

01:34:29.263 --> 01:34:30.498
MEMBERSHIP. AND WHEN YOU BUY A

01:34:30.564 --> 01:34:33.200
HOME, AS YOU ALL KNOW, YOU HAVE

01:34:33.267 --> 01:34:33.834
TO HAVE PRINCIPAL INTEREST, TAX

01:34:33.901 --> 01:34:35.569
AND INSURANCE. SO THIS IS A

01:34:35.636 --> 01:34:37.338
REALLY KEY COMPONENT OF THE

01:34:37.405 --> 01:34:38.639
BUSINESS SUCCESS OF THE STATE,

01:34:38.706 --> 01:34:40.274
THE HOUSING SUCCESS OF THE

01:34:40.341 --> 01:34:41.842
STATE. SO AGAIN, WE APPLAUD YOU

01:34:41.909 --> 01:34:42.877
AND YOUR LEADERSHIP, MADAM

01:34:42.943 --> 01:34:44.211
CHAIR, AND ALSO THE

01:34:44.278 --> 01:34:45.546
COMMISSIONER. AND WE URGE THAT

01:34:45.613 --> 01:34:46.280
THE SUSTAINABLE INSURANCE

01:34:46.347 --> 01:34:49.550
STRATEGY BE FULLY AND COMPLETELY

01:34:49.617 --> 01:34:50.651
INTEGRATED AS QUICKLY AS

01:34:50.718 --> 01:34:51.952
POSSIBLE. SO CONSUMERS HAVE

01:34:52.019 --> 01:34:53.754
CHOICE. SO HOUSING CONTINUE TO

01:34:53.821 --> 01:34:55.723
BE ROBUST, AND ESPECIALLY WITH

01:34:55.790 --> 01:34:57.324
THE GOVERNOR'S LEADERSHIP AND

01:34:57.391 --> 01:34:58.893
THE LEGISLATURE'S LEADERSHIP ON

01:34:58.959 --> 01:35:01.195
HOUSING IN THE LAST 48 HOURS, IF

01:35:01.262 --> 01:35:02.563
THIS COULD ALL COME TOGETHER.

01:35:02.630 --> 01:35:04.665
THIS IS VERY, VERY IMPORTANT FOR

01:35:04.732 --> 01:35:05.733
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND FOR

01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:06.967
THE HOME BUILDING INDUSTRY, FOR

01:35:07.034 --> 01:35:09.003
THE CONSUMERS WHO BUY THE

01:35:09.070 --> 01:35:10.037

01:35:31.792 --> 01:35:33.260
VERY, VERY ANXIOUS TO START

01:35:33.327 --> 01:35:35.963
BEING ABLE TO PLACE INSURANCE

01:35:36.030 --> 01:35:37.832
WITH PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES

01:35:37.898 --> 01:35:39.633

01:35:39.700 --> 01:35:41.836
INSURANCE. WE ALSO JUST WANT TO
