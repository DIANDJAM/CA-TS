OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR SB 249.

00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:54.438
THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THAT

A SIMPLE BUT POWERFUL CHANGE

00:48:00.877 --> 00:48:03.180
THAT STRENGTHENS OUR DEMOCRACY.

00:48:03.247 --> 00:48:04.581
VOTER TURNOUT IN PRIMARY

ELECTIONS. THAT MEANS A SMALL,

00:48:10.087 --> 00:48:11.021
UNREPRESENTATIVE SLICE OF THE

00:48:11.088 --> 00:48:12.089

STUDIES SHOW THAT THE PRIMARY

00:48:33.744 --> 00:48:35.279

AND FOR YOUR BILL, THIS IS NOT A

00:52:18.768 --> 00:52:21.571

00:53:08.852 --> 00:53:09.819
SIMILAR BILL. THANK YOU, MR.

LETTING US TAKE TIME TO SPEAK

00:53:27.504 --> 00:53:29.639
TODAY. I AM THE PRESIDENT OF THE

00:53:29.706 --> 00:53:31.374
ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF

00:53:31.441 --> 00:53:33.577
EDUCATION. THIS IS NOT NEW. I

00:53:33.643 --> 00:53:35.111
HAVE BEEN CONCERNED. THIS IS THE

00:53:35.178 --> 00:53:37.180
THIRD TIME THAT I'VE BEEN HERE

00:53:37.247 --> 00:53:38.949
BEFORE, BEFORE COMMITTEES

00:53:39.015 --> 00:53:40.817
REGARDING THIS THIS ISSUE. IT

00:53:40.884 --> 00:53:43.253
STARTED BACK IN WITH SENATOR

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:46.389
MIN, WITH SB 286, I BELIEVE.

00:53:46.456 --> 00:53:47.791
THEN LAST YEAR IT WAS NEWMAN

00:53:47.857 --> 00:53:49.926
WITH SB 907, AND THEN THIS YEAR

00:53:49.993 --> 00:53:52.662
IT IS 249 WITH SENATOR UMBERG.

00:53:52.729 --> 00:53:54.764
AND IT JUST CONCERNS ME THAT WE

00:53:54.831 --> 00:53:56.032
HAVE SO MANY PRESSING ISSUES

00:53:56.099 --> 00:53:58.034
HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE

00:53:58.101 --> 00:53:59.636
CRIME AND WE HAVE HOMELESSNESS.

00:53:59.703 --> 00:54:01.938
WE HAVE FIRE RECOVERY EFFORTS,

00:54:02.005 --> 00:54:04.507
WATER ISSUES, SOARING GAS

00:54:04.574 --> 00:54:05.976
PRICES. AND SO IT JUST

00:54:06.042 --> 00:54:07.744
DISHEARTENS ME THAT THIS

00:54:07.811 --> 00:54:10.046
CONTINUES TO BE A PRIORITY HERE

00:54:10.113 --> 00:54:13.183
AT THE LEGISLATOR MOVING OUR

00:54:13.249 --> 00:54:14.618
ELECTIONS TO THE GENERAL

00:54:14.684 --> 00:54:15.752
ELECTION. PEOPLE TALK A LOT

00:54:15.819 --> 00:54:17.120
ABOUT VOTER FATIGUE, AND I

00:54:17.187 --> 00:54:18.855
AGREE, WE WIND UP AT THE BOTTOM

00:54:18.922 --> 00:54:20.490
OF THE BALLOT AND THERE IS

00:54:20.557 --> 00:54:21.625
FATIGUE BY THE TIME THEY GET

00:54:21.691 --> 00:54:23.193
DOWN TO THESE NONPARTISAN

00:54:23.259 --> 00:54:24.628
ELECTIONS. IT'S TIRING. BUT MORE

00:54:24.694 --> 00:54:25.528
THAN THAT, I THINK IT'S

00:54:25.595 --> 00:54:28.064
CONFUSING TO THEM. IN MY TEN

00:54:28.131 --> 00:54:29.399
CITIES, EACH CITY, THEY HAVE

00:54:29.466 --> 00:54:30.634
THEIR OWN EDUCATION ELECTIONS,

00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:32.102
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN DISTRICTS

00:54:32.168 --> 00:54:33.670
WITH ELECTIONS. SO THEY'VE GOT

00:54:33.737 --> 00:54:35.271
SUSIE OR SAM OR DIANA RUNNING

00:54:35.338 --> 00:54:36.573
AND THEN, WELL, WHO'S MARY

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:38.108
BARKEY? YOU KNOW, WHERE'D SHE

00:54:38.174 --> 00:54:39.809
COME FROM? BY HAVING US IN THE

00:54:39.876 --> 00:54:40.877
PRIMARY, WE CAN REALLY GET OUT

00:54:40.944 --> 00:54:42.145
AND DIFFERENTIATE OURSELVES.

00:54:42.212 --> 00:54:44.014
TELL THEM HOW THE COUNTY BOARD

00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:45.649
OF EDUCATION DIFFERS FROM THE

00:54:45.715 --> 00:54:47.217
LOCAL DISTRICTS. THE COUNTY

00:54:47.283 --> 00:54:48.785
BOARD IS AN APPEALS BOARD, MUCH

00:54:48.852 --> 00:54:49.853
DIFFERENT THAN THE DISTRICT. SO

00:54:49.919 --> 00:54:52.088
IT REALLY GIVES US A TIME TO

00:54:52.155 --> 00:54:52.922
DIFFERENTIATE WHO WE ARE, WHICH

00:54:52.989 --> 00:54:56.726
WHICH WE APPRECIATE. AND, YOU

00:54:56.793 --> 00:54:58.361
KNOW, CONSIDERING THE BUDGET

00:54:58.428 --> 00:55:00.730
ISSUES THAT WE HAVE HERE IN

00:55:00.797 --> 00:55:02.098
CALIFORNIA, THIS IS A VERY

00:55:02.165 --> 00:55:03.299
EXPENSIVE BILL, ESPECIALLY NOW

00:55:03.366 --> 00:55:04.801
THAT IT'S GONE FROM JUST THE

00:55:04.868 --> 00:55:06.169
COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION IN

00:55:06.236 --> 00:55:08.338
ORANGE COUNTY TO ADDING FOUR

00:55:08.405 --> 00:55:09.706
OTHER BOARDS THROUGHOUT THE

00:55:09.773 --> 00:55:11.141
STATE. IT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE

00:55:11.207 --> 00:55:13.009
BILL. AND THAT THAT CONCERNS ME

00:55:13.076 --> 00:55:15.745
THAT, YOU KNOW, FOR PERPETUITY,

00:55:15.812 --> 00:55:18.148
THAT IS GOING TO BE AN EXPENSE

00:55:18.214 --> 00:55:19.315
TO THE STATE. I DON'T BELIEVE IT

00:55:19.382 --> 00:55:21.618
SHOULD BE A PRIORITY. LAST YEAR,

00:55:21.685 --> 00:55:23.653
GOVERNOR NEWSOM VETOED THE BILL

00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:25.522
BASED ON LOCAL CONTROL. THAT WAS

00:55:25.588 --> 00:55:26.823
ONE OF HIS BIG ISSUES. AND

00:55:26.890 --> 00:55:28.491
THAT'S STILL AN ISSUE. WE DO

00:55:28.558 --> 00:55:30.060
BELIEVE IN LOCAL CONTROL, AND IT

00:55:30.126 --> 00:55:31.661
IS DISAPPOINTING THAT WITH THE

00:55:31.728 --> 00:55:32.696
THREE TIMES WE'VE SEEN THE

00:55:32.762 --> 00:55:34.898
SIMILAR BILL, WE'VE NEVER HAD

00:55:34.964 --> 00:55:35.799
ANYONE TALK TO US ABOUT IT.

00:55:35.865 --> 00:55:37.500
WE'VE NEVER HAD A SENATOR COME

00:55:37.567 --> 00:55:39.002
SAY, HEY, THESE ARE OUR

00:55:39.069 --> 00:55:41.037
CONCERNS. WHAT DO YOU GUYS

00:55:41.104 --> 00:55:41.771
THINK? NOBODY'S COME TO US. NOT

00:55:41.838 --> 00:55:43.807
ONLY THAT, BUT WE HAD OUR LEGAL

00:55:43.873 --> 00:55:45.075
COUNSEL AND DEPARTMENT GO

00:55:45.141 --> 00:55:47.444
THROUGH ALMOST THREE DECADES OF

00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:49.713
AGENDA RECORDS, AND NO ONE HAS

00:55:49.779 --> 00:55:51.381
EVER BROUGHT THE ISSUE TO THE

00:55:51.448 --> 00:55:53.316
DÍAS TO OUR BOARDING BOARD ROOM.

00:55:53.383 --> 00:55:54.884
NOBODY'S EVER BEEN CONCERNED,

00:55:54.951 --> 00:55:57.187
WHETHER IT BE CONSTITUENTS OR

00:55:57.253 --> 00:55:58.988
ANYONE, ABOUT THIS ISSUE. AND SO

00:55:59.055 --> 00:56:00.156
WE'RE JUST CONCERNED WHY IT'S

00:56:00.223 --> 00:56:01.858
SUCH A PRIORITY. AND WE JUST

00:56:01.925 --> 00:56:03.793
HOPE THAT YOU GUYS WILL TAKE

00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:05.795
OTHER PRIORITIES THAT ARE REALLY

00:56:05.862 --> 00:56:06.896
CONCERNING HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I

00:56:06.963 --> 00:56:08.398
MEAN, WE'RE A MESS IN

00:56:08.465 --> 00:56:09.566
CALIFORNIA. AND SO WE JUST HOPE

00:56:09.632 --> 00:56:10.533
YOU'LL PRIORITIZE SOMETHING

00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:12.135
ELSE. AND AGAIN, I REALLY

00:56:12.202 --> 00:56:13.336
APPRECIATE YOU LISTENING TO ME

00:56:13.403 --> 00:56:14.637
TODAY. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:56:14.704 --> 00:56:16.372
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DID YOU

00:56:16.439 --> 00:56:19.909
HAVE A ARE YOU ALSO. YES.

00:56:19.976 --> 00:56:21.010
PRESENTING. YES. PLEASE GO

00:56:21.077 --> 00:56:24.714
AHEAD. HELLO. MY NAME IS BRANDON

00:56:24.781 --> 00:56:26.616
GUEVARA AND I AM THE BOARD

00:56:26.683 --> 00:56:27.784
LIAISON FOR THE ORANGE COUNTY

00:56:27.851 --> 00:56:29.219
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. I AM

00:56:29.285 --> 00:56:30.720
RESPECTFULLY URGING A NO VOTE ON

00:56:30.787 --> 00:56:32.856
SB 249, NOT SIMPLY BECAUSE OF

00:56:32.922 --> 00:56:34.224
ITS INFRINGEMENT ON LOCAL

00:56:34.290 --> 00:56:35.692
CONTROL OR ITS FISCAL

00:56:35.759 --> 00:56:36.760
IMPRUDENCE, BUT BECAUSE IT

00:56:36.826 --> 00:56:38.628
REPRESENTS A DEEPER

00:56:38.695 --> 00:56:39.129
MISUNDERSTANDING OF HOW

00:56:39.195 --> 00:56:40.430
DEMOCRATIC ENGAGEMENT ACTUALLY

00:56:40.497 --> 00:56:43.233
WORKS. SUPPORTERS OF SB 249

00:56:43.299 --> 00:56:44.701
ARGUE THAT CONSOLIDATING COUNTY

00:56:44.768 --> 00:56:46.302
BOARD OF EDUCATION ELECTIONS

00:56:46.369 --> 00:56:47.570
WITH THE STATEWIDE GENERAL

00:56:47.637 --> 00:56:48.705
ELECTION WILL ACTUALLY IMPROVE

00:56:48.772 --> 00:56:50.807
VOTER TURNOUT. HOWEVER, THE

00:56:50.874 --> 00:56:52.108
ARGUMENT THAT MORE VOTERS MEANS

00:56:52.175 --> 00:56:54.210
BETTER REPRESENTATION DOES NOT

00:56:54.277 --> 00:56:55.578
HOLD UP WHEN VOTER ATTENTION IS

00:56:55.645 --> 00:56:57.914
DILUTED. THESE ELECTIONS, WHICH

00:56:57.981 --> 00:56:59.482
ARE NONPARTISAN AND EDUCATIONAL

00:56:59.549 --> 00:57:00.884
AND FOCUS, ARE ALREADY

00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:02.051
OVERSHADOWED IN THE CROWDED

00:57:02.118 --> 00:57:03.853
NOVEMBER CYCLE. THIS BILL WILL

00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:05.188
BURY THEM EVEN FURTHER, PLACING

00:57:05.255 --> 00:57:06.689
CRITICAL DECISIONS ABOUT

00:57:06.756 --> 00:57:08.224
EDUCATIONAL LEADERSHIP BEHIND

00:57:08.291 --> 00:57:09.526
PAGES OF HIGHER PROFILE STATE

00:57:09.592 --> 00:57:11.728
AND FEDERAL RACES DIRECTLY

00:57:11.795 --> 00:57:14.264
IMPACTING PARENTS AND STUDENTS.

00:57:14.330 --> 00:57:16.065
WE ALREADY KNOW FROM STUDIES AND

00:57:16.132 --> 00:57:17.066
PAST ELECTIONS THAT VOTING DROPS

00:57:17.133 --> 00:57:18.968
OFF SHARPLY IN DOWN BALLOT

00:57:19.035 --> 00:57:21.037
RACES. THIS DROP OFF WILL

00:57:21.104 --> 00:57:22.172
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT COUNTY

00:57:22.238 --> 00:57:23.673
BOARD OF EDUCATION SEATS, WHICH

00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:26.476
ARE THE EXACT RACES THAT SB 249

00:57:26.543 --> 00:57:28.578
TARGETS. IN OTHER WORDS, WE ARE

00:57:28.645 --> 00:57:30.413
LIKELY TO SEE FEWER VOTERS

00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:31.147
MEANINGFULLY PARTICIPATE IN

00:57:31.214 --> 00:57:34.083
THESE CONTESTS, NOT MORE.

00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:36.653
MOREOVER, SB 249 IGNORES THAT

00:57:36.719 --> 00:57:37.987
THERE ARE LOCAL MECHANISMS TO

00:57:38.054 --> 00:57:40.190
MAKE THESE CHANGES IF NECESSARY.

00:57:40.256 --> 00:57:42.125
THIS ONE SIZE FITS ALL MANDATE

00:57:42.192 --> 00:57:43.126
IGNORES THE DIVERSITIES OF

00:57:43.193 --> 00:57:44.861
COUNTY NEEDS AND LOCAL ELECTORAL

00:57:44.928 --> 00:57:46.663
CONDITIONS. THIS IS NOT

00:57:46.729 --> 00:57:48.565
ELECTORAL MODERNIZATION. RATHER,

00:57:48.631 --> 00:57:50.233
IT IS PERFORMATIVE POLICYMAKING

00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:52.068
THAT WILL NOT ONLY COST MILLIONS

00:57:52.135 --> 00:57:53.770
BUT WEAKEN VOTER ENGAGEMENT AND

00:57:53.837 --> 00:57:55.238
EDUCATIONAL GOVERNANCE AND

00:57:55.305 --> 00:57:56.539
OVERRIDE LOCAL AUTONOMY WITHOUT

00:57:56.606 --> 00:57:58.875
ANY EVIDENCE OF BENEFIT

00:57:58.942 --> 00:57:59.709
WHATSOEVER. AGAIN, I URGE YOU TO

00:57:59.776 --> 00:58:05.481
VOTE NO. THANK YOU. ANY COMMENTS

00:58:05.548 --> 00:58:08.284
IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL,

00:58:08.351 --> 00:58:09.285
PUBLIC COMMENTS AND OPPOSITION

00:58:09.352 --> 00:58:14.824
TO THE BILL, SEEING NONE. MR.

00:58:14.891 --> 00:58:16.626
CHAIR, APOLOGIES. TRISTAN BROWN,

00:58:16.693 --> 00:58:18.027
CFT, UNION OF EDUCATORS.

00:58:18.094 --> 00:58:20.096
CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES BECAUSE OF

00:58:20.163 --> 00:58:22.332
THE SCHEDULING FLIP. WE WERE

00:58:22.398 --> 00:58:23.800
SUPPOSED TO BE HERE TO MEET TO

00:58:23.867 --> 00:58:25.468
THE SUPPORT SIDE. SO WE ARE IN

00:58:25.535 --> 00:58:27.170
SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT.

00:58:27.237 --> 00:58:29.572
THANK YOU. FAIR ENOUGH. WE WERE

00:58:29.639 --> 00:58:32.442
SCHEDULED TO TAKE UP SENATOR

00:58:32.508 --> 00:58:33.776
ASHBY'S BILL ON SPECIAL ORDER,

00:58:33.843 --> 00:58:38.147
BUT SO WITH THE CHANGE IN

00:58:38.214 --> 00:58:39.949
SCHEDULE, ARE THERE ANY FURTHER

00:58:40.016 --> 00:58:41.384
PUBLIC COMMENTS EITHER IN

00:58:41.451 --> 00:58:43.152
SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION TO THIS

00:58:43.219 --> 00:58:46.389
MEASURE? SEEING NONE. BRING IT

00:58:46.456 --> 00:58:48.591
BACK. DOCTOR PATEL, THANK YOU

00:58:48.658 --> 00:58:50.059
FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD.

00:58:50.126 --> 00:58:51.527
I WAS NOT HERE FOR THE PREVIOUS

00:58:51.594 --> 00:58:52.662
DISCUSSION. SO I DO HAVE A

00:58:52.729 --> 00:58:54.597
COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. FIRST OF

00:58:54.664 --> 00:58:56.799
ALL, HOW ARE THE CALCULATIONS,

00:58:56.866 --> 00:58:57.600
SENATOR? HOW ARE THE

00:58:57.667 --> 00:58:59.636
CALCULATIONS DETERMINED THAT

00:58:59.702 --> 00:59:01.871
SHIFTING THE ELECTION OF COUNTY

00:59:01.938 --> 00:59:05.208
BOE TRUSTEES WOULD COST LOTS OF

00:59:05.275 --> 00:59:06.643
MONEY, SHIFTING FROM THE PRIMARY

00:59:06.709 --> 00:59:08.645
TO THE GENERAL, IN ADDITION,

00:59:08.711 --> 00:59:10.580
WOULD CAUSE AN ADDITIONAL COST?

00:59:10.647 --> 00:59:12.048
I CAN'T IMAGINE IT WOULD. IN

00:59:12.115 --> 00:59:14.651
FACT, I THINK IT WOULD BE A COST

00:59:14.717 --> 00:59:15.919
SAVINGS. THE ELECTION IS GOING

00:59:15.985 --> 00:59:17.387
TO HAPPEN IN THE PRIMARY. THE

00:59:17.453 --> 00:59:19.055
ELECTION IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN

00:59:19.122 --> 00:59:22.458
THE GENERAL. SIMPLY MOVING ONE

00:59:22.525 --> 00:59:24.160
ORDER OF RACES FROM THE PRIMARY

00:59:24.227 --> 00:59:26.996
TO THE GENERAL. ONE WOULD THINK

00:59:27.063 --> 00:59:29.999
THAT THERE'S VIRTUALLY NO COST.

00:59:30.066 --> 00:59:32.168
SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE'S A

00:59:32.235 --> 00:59:35.538
FEW ADDITIONAL LINES ON THE

00:59:35.605 --> 00:59:38.641
BALLOT, IT SEEMS INFINITESIMAL.

00:59:38.708 --> 00:59:40.043
THANK YOU. OPPOSITION. DO YOU

00:59:40.109 --> 00:59:42.111
HAVE CALCULATIONS ON HOW THIS

00:59:42.178 --> 00:59:43.947
WOULD COST? HAVE AN ADDITIONAL

00:59:44.013 --> 00:59:45.715
COST. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYWOMAN.

00:59:45.782 --> 00:59:47.150
SO MY NAME IS TOM SHEEHY. I'M

00:59:47.216 --> 00:59:49.585
NOT ONLY THE LOBBYIST FOR THE

00:59:49.652 --> 00:59:50.920
ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF

00:59:50.987 --> 00:59:52.789
EDUCATION, BUT I WAS ALSO THE

00:59:52.855 --> 00:59:54.057
CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE

00:59:54.123 --> 00:59:54.924
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

00:59:54.991 --> 00:59:56.326
FOR A PREVIOUS GOVERNOR. AND I

00:59:56.392 --> 00:59:57.627
CHAIRED THE COMMISSION ON STATE

00:59:57.694 --> 00:59:59.996
MANDATES FOR SEVERAL YEARS. SO I

01:00:00.063 --> 01:00:02.365
HAVE SOME EXPERTISE IN THIS

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:04.567
AREA. THIS BILL, LEGISLATIVE

01:00:04.634 --> 01:00:05.935
COUNCIL, YOUR LEGISLATIVE

01:00:06.002 --> 01:00:08.271
COUNCIL HAS LABELED THIS BILL AS

01:00:08.338 --> 01:00:10.773
A MANDATE. YES. WHAT THAT MEANS

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.141
IS, IS THAT IF THIS BILL MAKES

01:00:12.208 --> 01:00:13.977
IT TO THE GOVERNOR AND THE

01:00:14.043 --> 01:00:15.278
GOVERNOR SIGNS IT INTO LAW,

01:00:15.345 --> 01:00:16.679
ORANGE COUNTY, AS WELL AS

01:00:16.746 --> 01:00:19.015
SACRAMENTO COUNTY, SAN JOAQUIN

01:00:19.082 --> 01:00:20.383
COUNTY, ALAMEDA COUNTY, AND

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:21.451
RIVERSIDE COUNTY, THEY'RE GOING

01:00:21.517 --> 01:00:23.286
TO FILE TEST CLAIMS WITH THE

01:00:23.353 --> 01:00:24.754
COMMISSION ON STATE MANDATES.

01:00:24.821 --> 01:00:26.022
THERE'S A WHOLE COTTAGE INDUSTRY

01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:27.256
THAT HELPS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DO

01:00:27.323 --> 01:00:28.424
THIS. YOU'RE PROBABLY FAMILIAR

01:00:28.491 --> 01:00:30.059
WITH THAT. SAN DIEGO CERTAINLY

01:00:30.126 --> 01:00:31.728
FILED A NUMBER OF TEST CLAIMS

01:00:31.794 --> 01:00:32.895
OVER THE YEARS. THOSE TEST

01:00:32.962 --> 01:00:35.031
CLAIMS, I CAN ASSURE YOU, WILL

01:00:35.098 --> 01:00:35.898
BE APPROVED. IT'S A NO BRAINER

01:00:35.965 --> 01:00:36.899
BECAUSE WHAT THIS BECAUSE THE

01:00:36.966 --> 01:00:39.335
STATE CONSTITUTION SAYS IF THE

01:00:39.402 --> 01:00:40.870
LEGISLATURE OR THE GOVERNOR

01:00:40.937 --> 01:00:42.638
FORCES A LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENTITY

01:00:42.705 --> 01:00:44.507
TO DO SOMETHING TOMORROW THAT

01:00:44.574 --> 01:00:45.942
THEY'RE NOT DOING TODAY, WITH

01:00:46.009 --> 01:00:46.943
CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS LIKE CRIMES,

01:00:47.010 --> 01:00:49.345
THE GENERAL FUND IS ON THE HOOK

01:00:49.412 --> 01:00:50.847
FOR IT. SO THIS WILL GET

01:00:50.913 --> 01:00:51.981
APPROVED AS A MANDATE. AND THE

01:00:52.048 --> 01:00:52.882
SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE,

01:00:52.949 --> 01:00:54.550
NOT MY CLIENT, NOT ME, BUT THE

01:00:54.617 --> 01:00:55.385
SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE

01:00:55.451 --> 01:00:57.053
STAFF SAID THAT FOR ORANGE

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:58.221
COUNTY ALONE TO ADD ADDITIONAL

01:00:58.287 --> 01:01:00.023
BALLOT CARDS AND A PRESIDENTIAL

01:01:00.089 --> 01:01:01.791
ELECTION TO DO INFORMATION

01:01:01.858 --> 01:01:03.626
TECHNOLOGY PROCESSING AND

01:01:03.693 --> 01:01:06.129
RELATED STAFF TIME AND SO ON AND

01:01:06.195 --> 01:01:07.630
SO FORTH, IT WOULD BE SEVERAL

01:01:07.697 --> 01:01:08.931
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS

01:01:08.998 --> 01:01:10.800
JUST FOR ORANGE COUNTY. NOW, YOU

01:01:10.867 --> 01:01:11.768
MULTIPLY THAT BY FIVE, YOU'RE UP

01:01:11.834 --> 01:01:12.769
OVER A MILLION. AND THIS ISN'T

01:01:12.835 --> 01:01:14.670
GOING TO BE A ONE TIME COST,

01:01:14.737 --> 01:01:16.506
BECAUSE A NUMBER OF THOSE COST

01:01:16.572 --> 01:01:17.573
ELEMENTS WILL BE ONGOING, WHICH

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:18.808
MEANS EVERY TIME THERE'S AN

01:01:18.875 --> 01:01:19.876
ELECTION, YOUR CONSTITUENTS WILL

01:01:19.942 --> 01:01:21.577
BE PAYING FOR THE COST IN

01:01:21.644 --> 01:01:22.779
RIVERSIDE COUNTY AND ORANGE

01:01:22.845 --> 01:01:24.113
COUNTY, NOT THE ORANGE COUNTY

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:25.581
CITIZENS. SO WE DON'T THINK THIS

01:01:25.648 --> 01:01:27.950
IS FAIR TO OTHER PEOPLE AROUND

01:01:28.017 --> 01:01:29.352
THE STATE TO HAVE THE STATE

01:01:29.419 --> 01:01:30.253
GENERAL FUND PICK UP THESE

01:01:30.319 --> 01:01:31.687
COSTS. AGAIN, THIS CAN BE DONE

01:01:31.754 --> 01:01:33.523
IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY OR ORANGE

01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:34.991
COUNTY OR SACRAMENTO, ALAMEDA OR

01:01:35.058 --> 01:01:36.692
SAN JOAQUIN, ON THEIR OWN

01:01:36.759 --> 01:01:37.727
VOLITION. THEY DO NOT NEED A

01:01:37.794 --> 01:01:39.629
STATE STATUTE TO DO THIS. AND

01:01:39.695 --> 01:01:41.397
WHEN THE STATE STEPS IN AND

01:01:41.464 --> 01:01:42.532
PASSES A STATUTE TO DO IT, IT

01:01:42.598 --> 01:01:44.000
BECOMES A MANDATE. THAT'S HOW

01:01:44.067 --> 01:01:46.102
YOU GET TO MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

01:01:46.169 --> 01:01:47.870
YEAH. AS A FORMER SCHOOL BOARD

01:01:47.937 --> 01:01:49.338
TRUSTEE IN POWAY UNIFIED SCHOOL

01:01:49.405 --> 01:01:51.774
DISTRICT, WE KNOW THAT THE WE

01:01:51.841 --> 01:01:52.909
RARELY ACTUALLY RECOVER THE

01:01:52.975 --> 01:01:55.445
COSTS FROM UNFUNDED MANDATES. SO

01:01:55.511 --> 01:01:57.814
THAT THAT IS A GENUINE REALITY.

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:00.550
AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW

01:02:00.616 --> 01:02:02.452
SHIFTING FROM PRIMARY TO

01:02:02.518 --> 01:02:03.286
GENERAL, I STILL AM STRUGGLING

01:02:03.352 --> 01:02:04.387
WITH UNDERSTANDING HOW IT'S

01:02:04.454 --> 01:02:06.255
ACTUALLY GOING TO INCREASE

01:02:06.322 --> 01:02:07.356
COSTS. BUT THAT PUTTING THAT

01:02:07.423 --> 01:02:10.426
ASIDE, WHEN WE LOOK AT PRIMARY

01:02:10.493 --> 01:02:13.830
VERSUS GENERAL ELECTIONS, THIS

01:02:13.896 --> 01:02:15.631
ELECTION IS DECIDED IN THE

01:02:15.698 --> 01:02:17.633
PRIMARY. IS THAT CORRECT? AND

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:20.169
GENERALLY, VOTERS HAVE THIS

01:02:20.236 --> 01:02:21.804
IMPRESSION THAT BALLOTS THAT

01:02:21.871 --> 01:02:23.539
THEY CAST IN THE PRIMARY WOULD

01:02:23.606 --> 01:02:25.308
CONTINUE ON TO A GENERAL WHERE

01:02:25.374 --> 01:02:26.742
ELECTIONS ARE DECIDED. IN THIS

01:02:26.809 --> 01:02:28.611
CASE, THE ELECTION IS DECIDED IN

01:02:28.678 --> 01:02:30.279
THE PRIMARY. AND I THINK THAT'S

01:02:30.346 --> 01:02:32.181
REALLY UNEXPECTED FOR MANY

01:02:32.248 --> 01:02:33.549
VOTERS OUT THERE THAT THAT IS

01:02:33.616 --> 01:02:35.751
THE DECIDING VOTE THAT THEY'RE

01:02:35.818 --> 01:02:36.385
CASTING, WHETHER THEY CHOOSE TO

01:02:36.452 --> 01:02:38.254
PARTICIPATE OR NOT. DO YOU HAVE

01:02:38.321 --> 01:02:40.389
ANY COMMENTS? I THINK YOU YOU,

01:02:40.456 --> 01:02:41.524
SENATOR UMBERG, YOU ALREADY DID

01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:42.959
EXPLAIN ABOUT TURNOUT IN A

01:02:43.025 --> 01:02:43.993
PRIMARY VERSUS A GENERAL,

01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:45.394
BECAUSE THE ELECTORATE GENERALLY

01:02:45.461 --> 01:02:46.963
BELIEVES THAT IT'S THE PRIMARY

01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:49.432
WHICH COUNTS VERSUS THE GENERAL

01:02:49.499 --> 01:02:50.766
THAT COUNTS, AND THE PRIMARY IS

01:02:50.833 --> 01:02:53.336
JUST TO SELECT A TOP TWO OR

01:02:53.402 --> 01:02:53.936
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. IS THAT

01:02:54.003 --> 01:02:55.805
KIND OF THE TRENDS YOU'RE SEEING

01:02:55.872 --> 01:02:58.107
IN ORANGE COUNTY? WELL, AS WAS

01:02:58.174 --> 01:02:59.175
MENTIONED, THIS APPLIES TO ALL

01:02:59.242 --> 01:03:00.543
FIVE COUNTIES THAT CURRENTLY

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:02.211
ELECT THEIR BOARD OF EDUCATION

01:03:02.278 --> 01:03:04.714
IN THE PRIMARY. THE TREND WE SEE

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:07.416
IN ORANGE COUNTY IS THE SAME AS

01:03:07.483 --> 01:03:07.950
EVERYWHERE ELSE, THAT THE

01:03:08.017 --> 01:03:09.185
TURNOUT IN THE PRIMARY ELECTION

01:03:09.252 --> 01:03:11.387
IS VERY SMALL. AS TO WHAT

01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:13.289
INDIVIDUAL VOTERS THINK, I AGREE

01:03:13.356 --> 01:03:14.724
WITH YOU. I THINK COMMON SENSE

01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:16.392
TELLS US THAT MOST VOTERS WHO

01:03:16.459 --> 01:03:18.794
VOTE IN THE PRIMARY THINK THAT

01:03:18.861 --> 01:03:20.062
THERE'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER

01:03:20.129 --> 01:03:21.397
ELECTION IN THE FALL, AND THAT

01:03:21.464 --> 01:03:23.032
THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY

01:03:23.099 --> 01:03:24.867
DETERMINATIVE. I AGREE IN TERMS

01:03:24.934 --> 01:03:27.570
OF THE COSTS. I ALSO AGREE WITH

01:03:27.637 --> 01:03:30.473
YOU REALLY SHIFTING A FEW LINES

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:32.675
FROM THE PRIMARY TO THE GENERAL

01:03:32.742 --> 01:03:33.976
CANNOT BE THAT EXPENSIVE. BUT

01:03:34.043 --> 01:03:35.945
LET'S PUT THAT ASIDE. THIS IS A

01:03:36.012 --> 01:03:36.913
POLICY COMMITTEE, THIS DECIDE

01:03:36.979 --> 01:03:38.748
THIS COMMITTEE MAKES DECISIONS,

01:03:38.814 --> 01:03:40.249
I THINK, BASED ON WHAT'S BEST

01:03:40.316 --> 01:03:43.052
POLICY FOR CALIFORNIA. AND IS IT

01:03:43.119 --> 01:03:44.921
BEST POLICY IN CALIFORNIA THAT

01:03:44.987 --> 01:03:46.656
WE HAVE A MUCH LARGER AND

01:03:46.722 --> 01:03:48.891
DIVERSE ELECTORATE? CHOOSE THE

01:03:48.958 --> 01:03:50.326
REPRESENTATIVE? I THINK IT IS

01:03:50.393 --> 01:03:51.761
SUCH THAT'S THAT'S MY POINT OF

01:03:51.827 --> 01:03:54.630
VIEW. WHETHER WE HAVE BETTER

01:03:54.697 --> 01:03:55.898
REPRESENTATIVES OR NOT. THAT'S

01:03:55.965 --> 01:03:58.601
NOT OUR JOB. OUR JOB IS NOT TO

01:03:58.668 --> 01:03:59.135
FIGURE OUT WHETHER BETTER

01:03:59.202 --> 01:04:00.236
REPRESENTATIVES. A FELLOW NAMED

01:04:00.303 --> 01:04:01.470

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:06.475
TOLD ME ONE DAY, HE SAYS, WE ARE

01:04:06.542 --> 01:04:08.644
NOT THE BEST OF OUR DISTRICT. WE

01:04:08.711 --> 01:04:09.412
ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR

01:04:09.478 --> 01:04:10.846
DISTRICT. AND I THINK THAT'S

01:04:10.913 --> 01:04:11.847
TRUE. THAT'S WHAT WE WANT. WE

01:04:11.914 --> 01:04:12.748
WANT FOLKS WHO ARE

01:04:12.815 --> 01:04:13.916
REPRESENTATIVE OF THEIR DISTRICT

01:04:13.983 --> 01:04:15.785
AND THE GENERAL ELECTION. THAT

01:04:15.851 --> 01:04:17.787
ELECTORATE, I THINK, PROVIDES US

01:04:17.853 --> 01:04:20.890
A BETTER SENSE OF WHO IS

01:04:20.957 --> 01:04:21.657
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DISTRICT.

01:04:21.724 --> 01:04:28.698

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:14.269
AND SAFETY. I JUST THINK THAT

01:11:14.336 --> 01:11:15.871
THIS SHOULD BE SOMETHING

01:11:15.938 --> 01:11:16.572
AUTOMATICALLY THAT WE HAVE

01:11:16.639 --> 01:11:18.307
ALREADY BEEN DOING FOR ALL THESE

01:11:18.374 --> 01:11:19.575
YEARS, BUT WE HAVE NOT BEEN

01:11:19.642 --> 01:11:20.609
DOING THAT. AND SO I JUST

01:11:20.676 --> 01:11:22.711
APPRECIATE THE CHAIR AND

01:11:22.778 --> 01:11:23.245
SPECIFICALLY TOM AND YOUR

01:11:23.312 --> 01:11:23.846
RECOMMENDATIONS TO MAKE SURE

01:11:23.912 --> 01:11:25.114
THAT WE CAN PROTECT THESE

01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:27.816
STUDENTS WHEN THEY ARE

01:11:27.883 --> 01:11:28.550
DIFFICULT. DECISIONS ARE MADE

01:11:28.617 --> 01:11:29.985
THAT FAMILIES PLACE THESE

01:11:30.052 --> 01:11:31.186
STUDENTS, OR THIS DEPARTMENT OF

01:11:31.253 --> 01:11:32.554
EDUCATION PLACES THESE STUDENTS

01:11:32.621 --> 01:11:33.689
OUTSIDE OF STATE. WE CAN'T

01:11:33.756 --> 01:11:35.391

01:11:37.026 --> 01:11:38.661

01:11:38.727 --> 01:11:40.462

01:12:42.624 --> 01:12:43.692

CLAIMED THEY WERE HELPING ME,

01:13:36.478 --> 01:13:39.481
BUT INSTEAD I WAS TRAUMATIZED BY

01:13:39.548 --> 01:13:40.883

01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:46.688
UP WAS REALLY HARD FOR ME. MY

MOTHER HAD MUNCHAUSEN BY PROXY

01:13:48.924 --> 01:13:50.592

THE SCHOOL DISTRICT SENT ME AWAY

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:06.742
THEY CALLED IT THERAPEUTIC

01:14:06.809 --> 01:14:08.644
TRANSPORT, BUT IT FELT LIKE

01:14:08.710 --> 01:14:10.612
KIDNAPING. I CRIED AND BEGGED

01:14:10.679 --> 01:14:13.048
FOR HELP AT THE AIRPORT. NO ONE

01:14:13.115 --> 01:14:16.218
LISTENED. AT ALPINE. I WAS

01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:18.020
COMPLETELY CUT OFF FROM THE

MEDICATION, PSYCHOLOGICALLY

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:23.025
ABUSED AND THREATENED WITH CRUEL

PUNISHMENTS FOR NORMAL HEALTHY

01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:26.628
BEHAVIORS. I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO

01:14:26.695 --> 01:14:27.696
SPEAK FREELY, AND WHEN I TRIED

01:14:27.763 --> 01:14:29.898
TO CALL MY DAD, THE STAFF RIPPED

01:14:29.965 --> 01:14:31.366
THE PHONE FROM MY HANDS AND

01:14:31.433 --> 01:14:32.734
THREATENED ME WITH PHYSICAL

01:14:32.801 --> 01:14:34.870
RESTRAINTS. ALPINE SCARED ME

01:14:34.937 --> 01:14:37.406
INTO SILENCE. MY EXPERIENCE

01:14:37.472 --> 01:14:38.841
THERE STILL HAUNTS ME TO THIS

01:14:38.907 --> 01:14:40.609
DAY, LEADING TO RECURRING

01:14:40.676 --> 01:14:41.543
NIGHTMARES AND BEING DIAGNOSED

01:14:41.610 --> 01:14:44.713
WITH PTSD. ALPINE CAUSED ME TO

01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:46.415
REGRESS, NOT SUCCEED. FOR MANY

01:14:46.481 --> 01:14:48.250
YEARS. THE TRAUMA STUNTED MY

01:14:48.317 --> 01:14:49.585
DEVELOPMENT, DELAYED MY

01:14:49.651 --> 01:14:51.820
INDEPENDENCE, CAUSED LEARN

01:14:51.887 --> 01:14:52.921
HELPLESSNESS, AND TAUGHT ME TO

01:14:52.988 --> 01:14:54.656
ACCEPT THE ABUSE AND COERCIVE

01:14:54.723 --> 01:14:56.892
CONTROL IN MY FAMILY. I AM HERE

01:14:56.959 --> 01:14:58.360
TODAY RELIVING THIS STORY,

01:14:58.427 --> 01:14:59.728
BECAUSE I AM SO SAD THAT THIS IS

01:14:59.795 --> 01:15:01.129
STILL HAPPENING TO CALIFORNIA

01:15:01.196 --> 01:15:03.332

01:15:08.871 --> 01:15:10.472
DIDN'T TRANSLATE TO YOUTH

01:15:10.539 --> 01:15:12.274
OUTSIDE OF FOSTER CARE, BECAUSE

01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:13.876
HUNDREDS OF STUDENTS WITH IEPS

01:15:13.942 --> 01:15:16.011
ARE STILL BEING SENT AWAY. THIS

01:15:16.078 --> 01:15:17.379
BILL ENSURES THAT ANY STUDENT

01:15:17.446 --> 01:15:19.181
SENT OUT OF STATE IS NOT OUT OF

01:15:19.248 --> 01:15:21.083
SIGHT, OUT OF MIND. HAD THIS

01:15:21.149 --> 01:15:22.784
BILL BEEN LAW WHEN I WAS 16, I

01:15:22.851 --> 01:15:24.586
MIGHT HAVE FELT SAFER. I MIGHT

01:15:24.653 --> 01:15:26.722
HAVE BEEN RESCUED. I MIGHT NOT

01:15:26.788 --> 01:15:28.523
STILL BE HEALING FROM SOMETHING

01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:30.525
THAT NEVER SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED

01:15:30.592 --> 01:15:32.961
IN THE FIRST PLACE. PLEASE PASS

01:15:33.028 --> 01:15:36.064
SB 373. NO STUDENT SHOULD BE

01:15:36.131 --> 01:15:37.132
INVISIBLE IN A SYSTEM THAT'S

01:15:37.199 --> 01:15:39.034
MEANT TO SUPPORT THEIR MENTAL

01:16:17.272 --> 01:16:18.707
MUCH, CHAIR MURATSUCHI AND

01:16:18.774 --> 01:16:20.842
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. AS

01:16:20.909 --> 01:16:21.843
SENATOR GROVE MENTIONED, MY NAME

01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:24.212
IS CAROLINE COLE. I WORK WITH

01:16:24.279 --> 01:16:25.414
PARIS HILTON'S ORGANIZATION. AND

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:26.882
FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS, SINCE

01:16:26.949 --> 01:16:28.617
PARIS CAME OUT WITH HER STORY

01:16:28.684 --> 01:16:29.751
PUBLICLY, WE'VE HAD THE

01:16:29.818 --> 01:16:30.552
INCREDIBLE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING

01:16:30.619 --> 01:16:34.056
ON THIS ISSUE ACROSS THE NATION.

01:16:34.122 --> 01:16:35.157
AND WHAT HAS BEEN INTERESTING

01:16:35.223 --> 01:16:37.259
ABOUT THAT IS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE

01:16:37.326 --> 01:16:38.727
TO SEE REALLY, THE LANDSCAPE OF

01:16:38.794 --> 01:16:40.495
WHAT WE'RE WORKING WITH IN IN

01:16:40.562 --> 01:16:43.398
ITS FULL ENTIRETY. AND I WILL

01:16:43.465 --> 01:16:46.234
SAY CALIFORNIA. AND AS A

01:16:46.301 --> 01:16:48.103
CALIFORNIA NATIVE MYSELF,

01:16:48.170 --> 01:16:49.504
UNFORTUNATELY, HAS EARNED THIS

01:16:49.571 --> 01:16:50.939
REPUTATION AS BEING ONE OF THE

01:16:51.006 --> 01:16:53.575
BIGGEST EXPORTER OF CHILDREN TO

01:16:53.642 --> 01:16:55.644
OTHER STATES. AND WE ARE SO

01:16:55.711 --> 01:16:57.446
GRATEFUL FOR ALL OF THE WORK

01:16:57.512 --> 01:16:59.481
THAT'S BEEN DONE TO HELP REMEDY

01:16:59.548 --> 01:17:01.416
THAT OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS.

01:17:01.483 --> 01:17:02.751
BUT I THINK THAT WE'VE LEFT

01:17:02.818 --> 01:17:04.653
SOMETHING ON THE TABLE HERE, AND

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:05.721
THAT IS SOME OF OUR MOST

01:17:05.787 --> 01:17:07.556
VULNERABLE KIDS, KIDS WHO ARE IN

01:17:07.622 --> 01:17:09.157
THE SPECIAL EDUCATION SYSTEM. SO

01:17:09.224 --> 01:17:10.726
THIS THIS ISSUE IS DEEPLY

01:17:10.792 --> 01:17:13.261
PERSONAL TO ME. I WAS SENT FROM

01:17:13.328 --> 01:17:14.663
CALIFORNIA TO AN INSTITUTION IN

01:17:14.730 --> 01:17:16.965
NEW YORK. YOU COULD NOT GET

01:17:17.032 --> 01:17:19.468
FARTHER AWAY FROM MY HOMETOWN.

01:17:19.534 --> 01:17:21.937
AND SO I KNOW REALLY WHAT A LIFE

01:17:22.004 --> 01:17:23.805
ALTERING EXPERIENCE THIS CAN BE.

01:17:23.872 --> 01:17:24.906
BUT TODAY, I'M NOT HERE TO SPEAK

01:17:24.973 --> 01:17:27.309
JUST TO MY EXPERIENCE, BUT THE

01:17:27.376 --> 01:17:28.810
EVIDENCE THAT WE SEE, AND THAT

01:17:28.877 --> 01:17:30.946
IS JUST LAST WEEK, THE

01:17:31.013 --> 01:17:32.280
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

01:17:32.347 --> 01:17:34.116
EDUCATION RELEASED A FIRST OF

01:17:34.182 --> 01:17:37.052
ITS KIND REPORT ON NONPUBLIC

01:17:37.119 --> 01:17:39.554
SCHOOLS AND AGENCIES. AND THE

01:17:39.621 --> 01:17:41.656
FINDINGS WERE REALLY SOBERING.

01:17:41.723 --> 01:17:43.892
THEY FOUND THAT THERE'S OVER 300

01:17:43.959 --> 01:17:45.460
CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WITH IEPS

01:17:45.527 --> 01:17:47.396
THAT REMAIN IN OUT OF STATE

01:17:47.462 --> 01:17:49.264
PLACEMENTS, MANY IN STATES WITH

01:17:49.331 --> 01:17:51.400
FEWER PROTECTIONS THAN OUR OWN.

01:17:51.466 --> 01:17:53.702
AND I ALSO REALLY WANT TO

01:17:53.769 --> 01:17:56.171
EMPHASIZE THAT WE HEAR FROM

01:17:56.238 --> 01:17:58.306
PARENTS THAT THEY DON'T

01:17:58.373 --> 01:17:59.775
UNDERSTAND WHEN THEY HEAR THAT

01:17:59.841 --> 01:18:01.576
THEIR CHILD IS BEING PLACED IN

01:18:01.643 --> 01:18:03.078
AN OUT OF STATE, THEY THINK THAT

01:18:03.145 --> 01:18:04.413
THEY'RE GOING TO RECEIVE BETTER

01:18:04.479 --> 01:18:06.214
CARE, THEY'RE GOING TO RECEIVE

01:18:06.281 --> 01:18:07.015
MORE RESOURCES, THAT THEY'RE

01:18:07.082 --> 01:18:09.151
GOING TO HAVE A CHANCE AT THEIR

01:18:09.217 --> 01:18:10.886
EDUCATION. AND THE FACTS ARE, IS

01:18:10.952 --> 01:18:14.156
THAT THAT IS ANYTHING BUT TRUE.

01:18:14.222 --> 01:18:15.524
THE STUDY ALSO REVEALED THAT

01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:17.392
THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS

01:18:17.459 --> 01:18:19.161
AROUND LACK OF MONITORING,

01:18:19.227 --> 01:18:20.328
INSUFFICIENT DATA COLLECTION,

01:18:20.395 --> 01:18:22.731
AND REALLY NO CENTRALIZED

01:18:22.798 --> 01:18:24.566
OVERSIGHT FRAMEWORK. MANY OF

01:18:24.633 --> 01:18:26.068
THESE STUDENTS ARE SENT TO HIGH

01:18:26.134 --> 01:18:28.236
RISK FACILITIES WHERE PRACTICES

01:18:28.303 --> 01:18:30.072
LIKE SECLUSION, RESTRAINT AND

01:18:30.138 --> 01:18:33.575
ISOLATION STILL OCCUR. AND SO SB

01:18:33.642 --> 01:18:35.777
373 REALLY TAKES DIRECT AIM AT

01:18:35.844 --> 01:18:37.879
THESE GAPS. IT LETS PARENTS AND

01:18:37.946 --> 01:18:39.414
STUDENTS KNOW WHAT THEIR RIGHTS

01:18:39.481 --> 01:18:40.982
ARE. IT MAKES SURE THAT THESE

01:18:41.049 --> 01:18:42.617
OUT OF STATE STUDENTS ARE BEING

01:18:42.684 --> 01:18:43.985
VISITED, THAT THEY'RE BEING

01:18:44.052 --> 01:18:45.420
MONITORED, AND THAT THERE IS A

01:18:45.487 --> 01:18:47.022
MINIMUM STANDARD OF CARE. THANK

01:18:47.089 --> 01:18:48.824
YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND

01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:50.459
CONSIDERATION ON THIS BILL. WE

01:18:50.525 --> 01:18:52.761
APPRECIATE IT. AND I KNOW PARIS

01:18:52.828 --> 01:18:53.395
WISHES THAT SHE COULD BE HERE

01:18:53.462 --> 01:18:54.663
TODAY. THANK YOU, THANK YOU,

THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS

01:21:32.254 --> 01:21:33.588
FORWARD. AND I WANT TO THANK

01:21:33.655 --> 01:21:35.090
YOUR YOUR WITNESS FOR SHARING

01:21:35.156 --> 01:21:36.124
YOUR YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. I

01:21:36.191 --> 01:21:39.294
WAS JUST CURIOUS WHAT WHAT TIME,

01:21:39.361 --> 01:21:41.763
WHAT, YOU KNOW, YEARS DID YOUR

01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:43.698
EXPERIENCE TAKE PLACE? THAT WAS

01:21:43.765 --> 01:21:47.002
IN 2011. OKAY. FROM 2011 TO

01:21:47.068 --> 01:21:48.503
2012, I WAS THERE FOR TEN MONTHS

01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:50.472
WITH WHICH AT THE TIME WAS A

01:21:50.538 --> 01:21:51.940
RECORD SHORT PLACEMENT. THERE

01:21:52.007 --> 01:21:53.141
WERE SOME STUDENTS WHO WERE

01:21:53.208 --> 01:21:54.509
THERE FOR YEARS AND YEARS. YEAH,

01:21:54.576 --> 01:21:59.281
BUT IT'S NOT THAT DISTANT OF A

01:21:59.347 --> 01:22:03.118
PAST. AND SO, YEAH, LIKE DOCTOR

01:22:03.184 --> 01:22:05.453
PATEL, I ALSO SERVED ON A SCHOOL

01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:07.455
BOARD BEFORE I CAME HERE TO THE

01:22:07.522 --> 01:22:11.793
LEGISLATURE. AND I REMEMBER. YOU

01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:13.962
KNOW, FOR THE STUDENTS THAT WE

01:22:14.029 --> 01:22:16.898
DID NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO, TO

01:22:16.965 --> 01:22:18.633
BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE TO, TO

01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:21.069
MEET THEIR, THEIR SPECIAL

01:22:21.136 --> 01:22:23.438
EDUCATION NEEDS. THERE WERE A

01:22:23.505 --> 01:22:25.040
NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT WE WOULD

01:22:25.106 --> 01:22:27.676
SEND, ESPECIALLY I REMEMBER

01:22:27.742 --> 01:22:29.377
PROVO, UTAH, THERE ARE SO MANY

01:22:29.444 --> 01:22:33.915
KIDS SENT TO PROVO, UTAH AND.

01:22:33.982 --> 01:22:37.619
YEAH, AND I ALWAYS ASSUMED THAT

01:22:37.686 --> 01:22:40.155
THAT THE FAMILY MEMBERS WOULD

01:22:40.221 --> 01:22:42.023
ENSURE THAT THE WELL BEING OF

01:22:42.090 --> 01:22:45.927
THE CHILD. BUT WE KNOW THAT THAT

01:22:45.994 --> 01:22:47.095
UNFORTUNATELY IS NOT ALWAYS THE

01:22:47.162 --> 01:22:49.731
CASE. AND SO YOUR YOUR TESTIMONY

01:22:49.798 --> 01:22:51.433
WAS A VERY POWERFUL REMINDER OF

01:22:51.499 --> 01:22:53.535
THAT. AND, AND SENATOR GROVE,

01:22:53.601 --> 01:22:55.870
YOUR, YOUR BILL IS IMPORTANT TO

01:22:55.937 --> 01:23:00.342
MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO

01:23:00.408 --> 01:23:02.444
MONITOR THE WELL-BEING OF OUR

01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:03.978
STUDENTS, WHETHER THEY'RE IN

01:23:04.045 --> 01:23:06.147
CALIFORNIA OR OUTSIDE. SO WOULD

01:23:06.214 --> 01:23:07.449
YOU LIKE TO CLOSE? THANK YOU,

01:23:07.515 --> 01:23:08.717
MR. CHAIR. AND THANK YOU,

01:23:08.783 --> 01:23:11.853
ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATEL. ZOE, WHO

01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:13.788
CAME UP AT THE LAST, WAS ONE OF

01:23:13.855 --> 01:23:15.156
OUR LEAD WITNESSES LAST TIME.

01:23:15.223 --> 01:23:16.624
AND I WANT TO THANK OUR

01:23:16.691 --> 01:23:18.360
WITNESSES BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO

01:23:18.426 --> 01:23:19.327
COME AND SHARE THEIR TESTIMONY.

01:23:19.394 --> 01:23:21.329
BUT WE NEED TO NOT FORGET OUT OF

01:23:21.396 --> 01:23:23.665
SIGHT, OUT OF MIND FOR THOSE 300

01:23:23.732 --> 01:23:24.532
PLUS KIDS THAT ARE STILL OUTSIDE

01:23:24.599 --> 01:23:25.700
OF OUR STATE'S CARE, CUSTODY AND

01:23:25.767 --> 01:23:27.402
CONTROL IN THE HANDS OF SOMEBODY

01:23:27.469 --> 01:23:29.404
ELSE. AND THE MAJORITY OF THE

01:23:29.471 --> 01:23:30.638
NUMBERS THAT COME BACK SAY

01:23:30.705 --> 01:23:31.973
THEY'RE NOT BEING TREATED WELL.

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:33.775
SO THANK YOU. AND I RESPECTFULLY

01:23:33.842 --> 01:23:36.077
ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU.

01:23:36.144 --> 01:23:37.345
WE DO NOT HAVE A QUORUM. AND SO

01:23:37.412 --> 01:23:38.780
WE WILL WAIT FOR THE VOTE ON

01:23:38.847 --> 01:23:41.649
YOUR MEASURE. I WILL TAKE IT UP

MODERNIZATION ACT. I KNOW THAT

01:24:56.691 --> 01:24:57.826
THERE'S AN ACRONYM IN THERE

01:24:57.892 --> 01:24:59.160
SOMEWHERE. I JUST HAVEN'T

01:24:59.227 --> 01:25:00.962
FIGURED IT OUT YET. I WANT TO

01:25:01.029 --> 01:25:03.064

APPRECIATE THEIR GOOD WORK ON

01:25:06.768 --> 01:25:11.005
THIS. IN 2014, ON A BIPARTISAN

01:25:11.072 --> 01:25:12.607
BASIS, THE LEGISLATURE PASSED

01:25:12.674 --> 01:25:16.077
AND THE GOVERNOR SIGNED SB 1266,

01:25:16.144 --> 01:25:19.647
AUTHORED BY SENATOR HUFF, WHICH

01:25:19.714 --> 01:25:20.281
REQUIRED EPINEPHRINE.

01:25:20.348 --> 01:25:23.985
EPINEPHRINE IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

01:25:24.052 --> 01:25:25.854
THAT MEASURE HAS HELPED

01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:27.889
SAFEGUARD CHILDREN, SAVING

01:25:27.956 --> 01:25:30.358
COUNTLESS LIVES TO DATE, AND HAS

01:25:30.425 --> 01:25:32.193
ENSURED OUR SCHOOL HEALTH

01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:34.028
PROFESSIONALS HAVE THE NECESSARY

01:25:34.095 --> 01:25:35.897
MEDICATION ON HAND TO PROVIDE

01:25:35.964 --> 01:25:38.700
LIFE SAVING TREATMENT, ACCORDING

01:25:38.766 --> 01:25:41.603
TO THE FOOD ALLERGY RESEARCH AND

01:25:41.669 --> 01:25:43.404
EDUCATION. THEY DO HAVE AN

01:25:43.471 --> 01:25:46.274
ACRONYM. IT'S FAIR. AS MANY AS

01:25:46.341 --> 01:25:47.976
33 MILLION AMERICANS SUFFER FROM

01:25:48.042 --> 01:25:50.912
LIFE THREATENING ALLERGIES. IT'S

01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:52.780
ESTIMATED THAT NEARLY 6 MILLION

01:25:52.847 --> 01:25:54.883
OF THESE PEOPLE ARE CHILDREN

01:25:54.949 --> 01:25:58.119
UNDER THE AGE OF 18. THAT IS,

01:25:58.186 --> 01:26:02.457
ONE IN EVERY 13 OR ON AVERAGE,

01:26:02.524 --> 01:26:05.393
TWO IN EVERY CLASSROOM. MANY

01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:08.229
FIRST TIME ALLERGIC REACTIONS

01:26:08.296 --> 01:26:11.366
THAT REQUIRE EPINEPHRINE DO

01:26:11.432 --> 01:26:15.003
INDEED HAPPEN AT SCHOOL.

01:26:15.069 --> 01:26:17.238
ANAPHYLAXIS IS A POTENTIALLY

01:26:17.305 --> 01:26:19.841
LETHAL ALLERGIC REACTION. IT CAN

01:26:19.908 --> 01:26:21.543
HAPPEN WHEN A PERSON IS STUNG BY

01:26:21.609 --> 01:26:24.379
A BEE, INGESTS FOOD SUCH AS

01:26:24.445 --> 01:26:26.948
SHELLFISH OR NUTS, OR MAYBE EVEN

01:26:27.015 --> 01:26:28.816
JUST COMES IN CONTACT WITH

01:26:28.883 --> 01:26:31.619
SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS LATEX. I

01:26:31.686 --> 01:26:33.788
AM WELL FAMILIAR WITH THAT, AS I

01:26:33.855 --> 01:26:35.590
HAVE BEEN WEARING THIS NECKLACE

01:26:35.657 --> 01:26:38.126
FOR ABOUT 40 YEARS BECAUSE I'M

01:26:38.192 --> 01:26:40.962
ALLERGIC TO PENICILLIN.

01:26:41.029 --> 01:26:43.131
EPINEPHRINE IS THE FIRST LINE OF

01:26:43.197 --> 01:26:44.999
TREATMENT FOR SOMEONE WHO IS

01:26:45.066 --> 01:26:47.468
EXPERIENCING ANAPHYLAXIS. IT CAN

01:26:47.535 --> 01:26:49.203
BE EASILY ADMINISTERED AND HAS

01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:51.072
VERY LITTLE SIDE EFFECT.

01:26:51.139 --> 01:26:53.007
ALLERGIC REACTIONS CAN BE SEVERE

01:26:53.074 --> 01:26:57.879
OR EVEN FATAL WITHOUT PROMPT

01:26:57.946 --> 01:26:59.681
ADMINISTRATION. SINCE THE

01:26:59.747 --> 01:27:02.650
PASSAGE OF SB 1266, THE STATE

01:27:02.717 --> 01:27:05.853
HAS MADE ACCESS TO PRESCHOOL A

01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:08.723
PRIORITY AND IS NOW EXPANDING TO

01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:11.893
UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL. STATE

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:14.329
PRESCHOOL WAS NOT CONTEMPLATED

01:27:14.395 --> 01:27:18.099
WHEN THE ORIGINAL BILL WAS

01:27:18.166 --> 01:27:19.834
DRAFTED, ALTHOUGH IT WAS THE

01:27:19.901 --> 01:27:22.036
INTENT OF THE AUTHOR TO PROVIDE

01:27:22.103 --> 01:27:26.040
ACCESS TO ALL STUDENTS, IT'S NOW

01:27:26.107 --> 01:27:27.442
NECESSARY TO NOT ONLY MODERNIZE

01:27:27.508 --> 01:27:29.243
THE CODE WITH MEDICATION

01:27:29.310 --> 01:27:31.379
DELIVERY SYSTEM LANGUAGE CHANGES.

01:27:31.446 --> 01:27:34.248
AS NEW AND IMPROVED MEDICATION

01:27:34.315 --> 01:27:37.185
HAS COME TO MARKET, BUT ALSO

01:27:37.251 --> 01:27:39.387
ADDRESS THE POTENTIAL GAP THAT

01:27:39.454 --> 01:27:40.788
PRESCHOOLERS MAY HAVE BY NOT

01:27:40.855 --> 01:27:42.690
BEING SPECIFICALLY CALLED OUT IN

01:27:42.757 --> 01:27:46.394
THE ORIGINAL BILL. SOME SCHOOL

01:27:46.461 --> 01:27:47.495
DISTRICTS EVEN HAVE EVEN

01:27:47.562 --> 01:27:50.498
EXPRESSED CONFUSION DUE TO SOME

01:27:50.565 --> 01:27:51.466
UNINTENDED REFERENCES IN THE

01:27:51.532 --> 01:27:53.701
CURRENT ELECTION CODE ON WHETHER

01:27:53.768 --> 01:27:55.436

PROVIDING EPINEPHRINE IN THEIR

01:27:57.338 --> 01:28:00.742
PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS OR NOT. THIS

01:28:00.808 --> 01:28:05.079
CLARITY PROVIDED BY SB 568 IS

01:28:05.146 --> 01:28:06.714
NEEDED FOR SCHOOLS TO ENSURE

01:28:06.781 --> 01:28:09.450
THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY

01:28:09.517 --> 01:28:11.285
EXPOSED LIABILITY FOR THEIR

01:28:11.352 --> 01:28:14.522
PRESCHOOL STUDENTS. SB 568

01:28:14.589 --> 01:28:16.624
SIMPLY MODERNIZES THE CODE WITH

01:28:16.691 --> 01:28:19.093
NEW TERMS FOR MEDICATION, AND

01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:20.962
CLARIFIES THE EXISTING

01:28:21.029 --> 01:28:23.164
REQUIREMENT FOR THE STOCKING OF

01:28:23.231 --> 01:28:24.966

COLLEGE OF ALLERGY HAS SUBMITTED

01:31:45.099 --> 01:31:46.601
A LETTER IN SUPPORT OF THIS

01:31:46.667 --> 01:31:48.369
BILL. I'M THE FATHER OF THREE

01:31:48.436 --> 01:31:49.403
CHILDREN WHO'VE GROWN UP IN

01:31:49.470 --> 01:31:51.272
CALIFORNIA AND ATTENDED PUBLIC

01:31:51.339 --> 01:31:52.506
SCHOOLS. I UNDERSTAND CLOSELY

01:31:52.573 --> 01:31:54.475
HOW TERRIFYING AND IMPORTANT

01:31:54.542 --> 01:31:55.910
ANAPHYLAXIS, ALLERGY AND FOOD

01:31:55.977 --> 01:31:57.645
ALLERGY ARE TO OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:31:57.712 --> 01:31:59.881
THE BRACELET I WEAR ON MY RIGHT

01:31:59.947 --> 01:32:01.716
WRIST IS FOR REMINDER OF NATALIE

01:32:01.782 --> 01:32:03.217
GEORGIE, WHO TRAGICALLY DIED

01:32:03.284 --> 01:32:05.219
FROM A FOOD ALLERGIC REACTION

01:32:05.286 --> 01:32:08.189
EVEN WITH EPINEPHRINE. 568 IS AN

01:32:08.256 --> 01:32:09.557
EXTENSION OF THE AMAZING SAFETY

01:32:09.624 --> 01:32:10.858
NET THAT WE CREATED IN SCHOOLS

01:32:10.925 --> 01:32:12.593
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHEN

01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:16.831
WE PASSED SB 1266 IN 2014, WE

01:32:16.898 --> 01:32:18.299
LED THE NATION CREATING A SCHOOL

01:32:18.366 --> 01:32:20.368
BASED PROGRAM OF UNASSIGNED

01:32:20.434 --> 01:32:21.836
EPINEPHRINE TO SUPPORT STUDENTS,

01:32:21.903 --> 01:32:23.571
FAMILIES, TEACHERS, SCHOOL

01:32:23.638 --> 01:32:25.406
NURSES, STAFF, AND FACULTY WHO

01:32:25.473 --> 01:32:26.908
ARE DEALING WITH THESE ALLERGIC

01:32:26.974 --> 01:32:29.010
REACTIONS ON THEIR CAMPUSES ON

01:32:29.076 --> 01:32:32.313
ANY GIVEN YEAR. I'M AWARE OF

01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:33.681
BETWEEN 15 AND 50 INCIDENTS OF

01:32:33.748 --> 01:32:35.383
ANAPHYLAXIS ON CAMPUS IN WHICH

01:32:35.449 --> 01:32:37.752
EPINEPHRINE IS USED AND ARGUABLY

01:32:37.818 --> 01:32:39.887
SAVED LIVES, WITH A CONSERVATIVE

01:32:39.954 --> 01:32:40.788
ESTIMATE THAT WOULD MEAN THAT WE

01:32:40.855 --> 01:32:43.457
HAVE SAVED BETWEEN 150 OR 200

01:32:43.524 --> 01:32:45.993
LIVES IN THE LAST DECADE, BUT I

01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:48.262
SUSPECT THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT

01:32:48.329 --> 01:32:49.931
UNDERESTIMATION. SB 568 WOULD BE

01:32:49.997 --> 01:32:51.766
AN EXTENSION OF THAT INCREDIBLE

01:32:51.832 --> 01:32:52.900
PLATFORM OF PUBLIC HEALTH SAFETY

01:32:52.967 --> 01:32:54.302
THAT WE HAVE BUILT IN

01:32:54.368 --> 01:32:55.603
CALIFORNIA. I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE

01:32:55.670 --> 01:32:57.505
YOU TO MOVE THIS BILL ALONG FOR

01:32:57.571 --> 01:33:00.641

01:34:14.515 --> 01:34:16.317
OPPOSITION? SEEING NONE. ANY

01:34:16.384 --> 01:34:19.220
PUBLIC COMMENTS IN OPPOSITION.

01:34:19.286 --> 01:34:22.356
SEEING NONE. I'D LIKE TO BRING

01:34:22.423 --> 01:34:24.358
IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE, DOCTOR

01:34:24.425 --> 01:34:27.161
PATEL, IT'D BE NICE IF SOME OF

01:34:27.228 --> 01:34:28.829
MY COLLEAGUES WERE HERE TO ASK

01:34:28.896 --> 01:34:30.364
THEIR QUESTIONS TOO. I DO HAVE

01:34:30.431 --> 01:34:31.432
QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR

01:34:31.499 --> 01:34:32.566
BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD FOR

01:34:32.633 --> 01:34:35.603
US TODAY. JUST TO CLARIFY, THIS

01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:37.772
IS CURRENTLY POLICY IN THE STATE

01:34:37.838 --> 01:34:40.808
OF CALIFORNIA FOR OUR LEAS TO

01:34:40.875 --> 01:34:42.543
STOCK NON ASSIGNED, AS YOU

01:34:42.610 --> 01:34:44.712
DESCRIBED, PRESCRIPTION

01:34:44.779 --> 01:34:46.514
EPINEPHRINE ON OUR CAMPUSES. AND

01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:47.982
THE INTENT OF THIS BILL WOULD

01:34:48.049 --> 01:34:49.717
JUST TO BE TO FILL THAT MISSING

01:34:49.784 --> 01:34:52.219
BLOCK OF NEW CHILDREN THAT ARE

01:34:52.286 --> 01:34:54.155
ON OUR SCHOOL CAMPUSES NOW THAT

01:34:54.221 --> 01:34:56.524
WE HAVE UTCC. THAT'S CORRECT.

01:34:56.590 --> 01:35:02.029
THERE ARE CONFLICTING REFERENCES

01:35:02.096 --> 01:35:05.199
TO RELEVANT GRADES PRIMARY,

01:35:05.266 --> 01:35:06.367
SECONDARY, JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL,

01:35:06.434 --> 01:35:08.869
HIGH SCHOOL. AND SO WE'VE JUST

01:35:08.936 --> 01:35:11.672
BROADENED IT TO LOCAL EDUCATION

01:35:11.739 --> 01:35:13.941
AGENCIES SO THAT IT INCLUDES ALL

01:35:14.008 --> 01:35:17.445
PUBLIC SCHOOLS, INCLUDING, AS I

01:35:17.511 --> 01:35:19.713
INDICATED, THE PRESCHOOL, WHICH

01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:22.249
WAS NOT CONTEMPLATED WHEN

01:35:22.316 --> 01:35:25.486
SENATOR HUFF HAD HIS BILL. AND

01:35:25.553 --> 01:35:27.188
THE DOSES THAT ARE KEPT ON

01:35:27.254 --> 01:35:29.390
CAMPUS, ARE THEY APPROPRIATE FOR

01:35:29.457 --> 01:35:31.559
PRESCHOOL AGED CHILDREN BY

01:35:31.625 --> 01:35:34.261
WEIGHT? WELL, WEIGHT IS ACTUALLY

01:35:34.328 --> 01:35:35.930
IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL. I

01:35:35.996 --> 01:35:39.166
WILL ASK DOCTOR MILLER TO

01:35:39.233 --> 01:35:43.104
ADDRESS THAT ISSUE BECAUSE

01:35:43.170 --> 01:35:44.839
WEIGHT, AS I SAID, IS ADDRESSED

01:35:44.905 --> 01:35:47.475
IN THE BILL. AND AS FAR AS I

01:35:47.541 --> 01:35:51.679
KNOW, THE EPINEPHRINE IS SAFE

01:35:51.745 --> 01:35:54.949
FOR USE OF CHILDREN AS LITTLE AS

01:35:55.015 --> 01:35:59.286
SIX MONTHS. SO EPINEPHRINE

01:35:59.353 --> 01:36:00.154
EPINEPHRINE IS WEIGHT BASED IN

01:36:00.221 --> 01:36:03.591
THE PEDIATRIC SPACE. THERE ARE

01:36:03.657 --> 01:36:05.759
MULTITUDE OF SELF-INJECTABLE

01:36:05.826 --> 01:36:07.862
EPINEPHRINE DEVICES AVAILABLE

01:36:07.928 --> 01:36:09.563
NOW ON THE MARKET, WHICH INCLUDE

01:36:09.630 --> 01:36:13.667
THE 0.3MG, 0.15 AND 0.1 IS

01:36:13.734 --> 01:36:16.237
AVAILABLE. DIFFERENT

01:36:16.303 --> 01:36:19.707
MANUFACTURERS HAVE MADE THESE

01:36:19.773 --> 01:36:21.942
DOSES AVAILABLE THROUGH SCHOOL

01:36:22.009 --> 01:36:23.344
PROGRAMS, WHERE THEY'RE

01:36:23.410 --> 01:36:25.179
ESSENTIALLY DONATED WITHOUT

01:36:25.246 --> 01:36:26.280
PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS. ALTHOUGH

01:36:26.347 --> 01:36:28.782
KIRSTEN WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT,

01:36:28.849 --> 01:36:30.651
SOME SOME SCHOOLS HAVE TO GO OUT

01:36:30.718 --> 01:36:33.087
AND GET THEM, GET THEIRS. SO

01:36:33.154 --> 01:36:34.188
MOST PRESCHOOLERS, I BELIEVE,

01:36:34.255 --> 01:36:36.023
WOULD BE THREE YEARS OLD. AND SO

01:36:36.090 --> 01:36:38.125
THEY WOULD PROBABLY BE GETTING

01:36:38.192 --> 01:36:40.394
2.15 DOSE OF EPINEPHRINE, WHICH

01:36:40.461 --> 01:36:42.396
IS BROADLY AVAILABLE. THERE IS A

01:36:42.463 --> 01:36:43.898
POINT ONE. THERE IS A POINT

01:36:43.964 --> 01:36:46.066
THREE. THANK YOU FOR THAT. THERE

01:36:46.133 --> 01:36:46.867
ARE SOME CHILDREN IN CERTAIN

01:36:46.934 --> 01:36:48.636
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE SMALLER. SO

01:36:48.702 --> 01:36:49.904
JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

01:36:49.970 --> 01:36:51.505
ABLE TO COVER THE BASES SAFELY

01:36:51.572 --> 01:36:54.308
SHOULD THE NEED ARISE. ALSO IN

01:36:54.375 --> 01:36:55.776
SCHOOLS, WE KNOW THAT MANY OF

01:36:55.843 --> 01:36:57.511
OUR ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS DON'T

01:36:57.578 --> 01:36:59.079
ACTUALLY HAVE NURSES. THEY HAVE

01:36:59.146 --> 01:37:01.582
HEALTH TECHS. AND IN THOSE

01:37:01.649 --> 01:37:03.284
SITUATIONS WE ASK FOR VOLUNTEERS

01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:04.952
AMONGST OUR USUALLY TYPICALLY

01:37:05.019 --> 01:37:06.954
OUR CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES TO GET

01:37:07.021 --> 01:37:08.355
THE TRAINING NECESSARY TO DO

01:37:08.422 --> 01:37:09.857
THAT. AND THIS WOULD FOLLOW

01:37:09.924 --> 01:37:11.692
ALONG THAT SAME PROTOCOL AS

01:37:11.759 --> 01:37:13.827
ALREADY ASSIGNED. SO IT'S NO

01:37:13.894 --> 01:37:15.896
NOTHING NEW COMING THE WAY OF

01:37:15.963 --> 01:37:17.731
OUR SCHOOLS. WE ARE CHANGING AS

01:37:17.798 --> 01:37:19.934
LITTLE AS POSSIBLE IN THE

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.369
ORIGINAL BILL. EXACTLY. FOR THAT

01:37:22.436 --> 01:37:24.305
REASON, THE INTENT IS JUST TO

01:37:24.371 --> 01:37:25.806
INCLUDE THOSE LOWER GRADES THAT

01:37:25.873 --> 01:37:28.242
WEREN'T CONTEMPLATED BACK AT THE

01:37:28.309 --> 01:37:31.478
TIME OF SB 1266. THANK YOU FOR

01:37:31.545 --> 01:37:33.247
BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD.

01:37:33.314 --> 01:37:37.151
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I ALSO

01:37:37.218 --> 01:37:38.919
WANT TO THANK YOU, SENATOR, FOR

01:37:38.986 --> 01:37:41.522
BRINGING THIS MEASURE FORWARD.

01:37:41.589 --> 01:37:46.594
HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL, AS

01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:50.864
AMENDED, TO MOVE ON TO THE

01:37:50.931 --> 01:37:51.498
APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE, WHICH

01:37:51.565 --> 01:37:55.502
LIKE CLOSE. WELL, I THANK YOU.

01:37:55.569 --> 01:37:57.071
THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S TIME FOR

01:37:57.137 --> 01:38:00.608
ME TO MAKE MY CLOTHES. YES, I

01:38:00.674 --> 01:38:02.076
RESPECTFULLY ASK AND I VOTE. ALL

01:38:02.142 --> 01:38:03.510
RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:38:03.577 --> 01:38:04.845
THANK YOU. WE DO NOT HAVE A

01:38:04.912 --> 01:38:07.114
QUORUM YET. AND SO AT THE

01:38:07.181 --> 01:38:08.148
APPROPRIATE TIME, WE WILL TAKE A

01:38:08.215 --> 01:38:09.917
VOTE ON YOUR MEASURE. THANK YOU.

01:38:09.984 --> 01:38:13.254
ALL RIGHT. AND THANKS AGAIN TO

01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:13.887
SENATOR ASHBY, MY GOOD FRIEND.

01:38:13.954 --> 01:38:19.727
ALL RIGHT. OKAY. SENATOR ASHBY,

01:38:19.793 --> 01:38:26.133
WE ARE. TAKING UP FILE ITEM

01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:44.018
NUMBER ONE, SENATE BILL 414.

01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:55.696
THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU,

01:38:55.763 --> 01:38:57.498
MR. CHAIR. APPRECIATE THE

01:38:57.564 --> 01:39:00.134
OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE. AND

01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:01.068
THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING THE OTHER

01:39:01.135 --> 01:39:02.803
SENATORS TO GO FIRST SO WE COULD

01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:05.406
GET THEM ON WITH THEIR DAY. I

01:39:05.472 --> 01:39:06.840
APPRECIATE THAT CONVENIENCE THAT

01:39:06.907 --> 01:39:08.642
YOU PROVIDED FOR THEM. THANK YOU

01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:11.912
SO MUCH. KIND. I AM HERE TO

01:39:11.979 --> 01:39:14.315
PRESENT SB 414, THE CHARTER

01:39:14.381 --> 01:39:16.817
SCHOOL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT. THIS

01:39:16.884 --> 01:39:18.719
BILL MAKES SEVERAL CHANGES TO

01:39:18.786 --> 01:39:21.121
FISCAL OVERSIGHT AND FINANCIAL

01:39:21.188 --> 01:39:22.990
REPORTING FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS

01:39:23.057 --> 01:39:25.259
AND CHARTER SCHOOL AUTHORIZERS,

01:39:25.326 --> 01:39:26.960
INCLUDING IMPORTANT TRANSPARENCY

01:39:27.027 --> 01:39:29.430
AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMPONENTS.

01:39:29.496 --> 01:39:31.131
START BY SAYING THAT I ACCEPT

01:39:31.198 --> 01:39:32.366
THE PROPOSED COMMITTEE

01:39:32.433 --> 01:39:33.867
AMENDMENTS WHICH DO THE THREE

01:39:33.934 --> 01:39:35.569
FOLLOWING THINGS. MAKE THE

01:39:35.636 --> 01:39:36.704
DRAFTED AMENDMENTS TO THE

01:39:36.770 --> 01:39:39.239
FUNDING DETERMINATION PROVISIONS

01:39:39.306 --> 01:39:41.108
INCLUDE ADDITIONAL STANDARDS AND

A WHILE, AND I'VE SAID THIS TO

01:40:22.883 --> 01:40:23.917

PEOPLE HAVE DEDICATED SO MUCH OF

01:40:28.622 --> 01:40:30.524
THE LAST YEAR OF THEIR LIFE TO

01:40:30.591 --> 01:40:31.892

INDIVIDUALS HAVE GIVEN SO MUCH

01:40:41.902 --> 01:40:44.104
TIME, ATTENTION AND EXPERTISE TO

01:40:44.171 --> 01:40:45.672

BE NOTED. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH,

01:40:48.075 --> 01:40:50.043

JUST AS INVOLVED, AND STUDENTS

01:41:10.164 --> 01:41:12.065
WHO FOR WHOM A TRADITIONAL

01:41:12.132 --> 01:41:14.601
SETTING JUST HAS NOT BECOME SAFE

01:41:14.668 --> 01:41:16.470
FOR THEM. CHARTER SCHOOLS SERVE

01:41:16.537 --> 01:41:18.639
AS A RESOURCE FOR COMMUNITIES.

01:41:18.705 --> 01:41:20.741

01:41:29.683 --> 01:41:32.286

01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:48.435
FINDINGS POINT BACK TO A GREATER

01:41:48.502 --> 01:41:51.805

IT IS VITAL TO IMPLEMENT STRONG

01:42:25.572 --> 01:42:27.674
ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES AND TO

01:42:27.741 --> 01:42:29.910

REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF SCHOOL

01:42:38.285 --> 01:42:41.788
THAT THEY ATTEND. SB 414 PUTS

01:42:41.855 --> 01:42:45.058
STUDENTS FIRST, PARTICULARLY

01:42:45.125 --> 01:42:46.360
STUDENTS WHO HAVE OFTEN BEEN

01:42:46.426 --> 01:42:48.929
LEFT BEHIND. STUDENTS WITH

01:43:04.778 --> 01:43:05.846
FINALLY, I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE

THROUGH THIS PROCESS, WHICH IS

01:43:13.754 --> 01:43:16.223
GOOD BECAUSE WE SHOULD BE

01:43:16.290 --> 01:43:17.791

01:48:04.411 --> 01:48:05.178
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE STATE

01:48:05.245 --> 01:48:06.947

THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S

01:48:22.729 --> 01:48:24.064

01:48:24.130 --> 01:48:25.498
CLARIFY AND STRENGTHEN MANY

MISNOMER. THE CHANGE TO FLEX

01:48:43.116 --> 01:48:45.785
THE CURRENT LAW AND THE PRACTICE

01:48:45.852 --> 01:48:48.088

01:49:04.571 --> 01:49:06.640
ON THOSE EARLY ACTIONS. IT TAKES

01:49:06.706 --> 01:49:08.408
A DELIBERATE APPROACH TO

01:49:08.475 --> 01:49:10.176

01:49:17.484 --> 01:49:18.652
THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO BALANCE

01:49:18.718 --> 01:49:20.687

01:49:23.356 --> 01:49:25.692

01:49:25.759 --> 01:49:27.560
EACH DOLLAR DIVERTED TO

01:49:27.627 --> 01:49:28.929

EFFECTIVELY TO PREVENT AND

01:54:43.876 --> 01:54:45.612
DETECT FRAUD, WASTE AND ABUSE.

01:54:45.678 --> 01:54:48.414
THE LEÓN FCMAT MADE SEVERAL

01:54:48.481 --> 01:54:49.549
RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO

01:54:49.616 --> 01:54:51.050
ENHANCE OUR SYSTEMS. TO THAT

01:54:51.117 --> 01:54:52.452
END. FOR EXAMPLE, THE CURRENT

01:54:52.518 --> 01:54:53.853
FUNDING DETERMINATION PROCESS

01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:55.888
ONLY REQUIRES THAT NCB CHARTERS

01:54:55.955 --> 01:54:57.790
SUBMIT ONE YEAR OF DATA

01:54:57.857 --> 01:54:59.359
ESTABLISHING THAT THE SCHOOL MET

01:54:59.425 --> 01:55:00.994
THRESHOLDS FOR SPENDING ON

01:55:01.060 --> 01:55:02.595
TEACHERS AND INSTRUCTIONAL

01:55:02.662 --> 01:55:03.997
SERVICES, AND MAINTAINED A SET

01:55:04.063 --> 01:55:05.298
STUDENT TO TEACHER RATIO.

01:55:05.365 --> 01:55:06.399
HOWEVER, THERE ARE NO CHECKS OR

01:55:06.466 --> 01:55:07.834
EVEN REPORTING TO THE STATE

01:55:07.900 --> 01:55:09.702
BOARD OF EXPENDITURES IN THE

01:55:09.769 --> 01:55:12.205
INTERVENING THREE YEARS. SB 414

01:55:12.272 --> 01:55:13.973
LACKS A PROPOSAL TO RESOLVE THIS

01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:16.142
KEY ISSUE. FURTHERMORE, THE LEÓN

01:55:16.209 --> 01:55:17.210
RECOMMENDED LIMITS ON SMALL

01:55:17.277 --> 01:55:19.712
DISTRICT AUTHORIZERS A3

01:55:19.779 --> 01:55:21.147
SPECIFICALLY SOUGHT OUT SMALL

01:55:21.214 --> 01:55:22.715
DISTRICTS, ALL BUT ONE WITH A

01:55:22.782 --> 01:55:24.817
TOTAL DISTRICT ADA OF LESS THAN

01:55:24.884 --> 01:55:26.653
300, BECAUSE A3 KNEW THOSE

01:55:26.719 --> 01:55:27.720
DISTRICTS DIDN'T HAVE THE

01:55:27.787 --> 01:55:29.656
CAPACITY TO EFFECTIVELY OVERSEE

01:55:29.722 --> 01:55:31.257
CHARTER SCHOOLS OF THEIR SIZE,

01:55:31.324 --> 01:55:33.059
THE LÀ, Þ AND FCMAT FOUND THAT

01:55:33.126 --> 01:55:35.295
OVER A THIRD OF CALIFORNIA'S

01:55:35.361 --> 01:55:36.329
NON-CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER,

01:55:36.396 --> 01:55:38.231
ADA, IS AUTHORIZED BY JUST 14

01:55:38.298 --> 01:55:41.367
SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. SB 414

01:55:41.434 --> 01:55:42.869
DISREGARDS A KEY REPORT FINDING

01:55:42.935 --> 01:55:44.370
AND RECOMMENDATION ON THIS TOPIC

01:55:44.437 --> 01:55:45.672
THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD SET

01:55:45.738 --> 01:55:47.240
LIMITS ON SMALL DISTRICT

01:55:47.307 --> 01:55:48.908
AUTHORIZERS WHO DO NOT HAVE THE

01:55:48.975 --> 01:55:49.742
CAPACITY TO OVERSEE LARGE

01:55:49.809 --> 01:55:51.411
NON-CLASSROOM BASED SCHOOLS.

01:55:51.477 --> 01:55:52.612
HIGHLANDS FURTHER PROVED TO US

01:55:52.679 --> 01:55:54.814
THAT WE MUST ALSO FIND WAYS TO

01:55:54.881 --> 01:55:56.215
HOLD AUTHORIZERS OF ALL SIZES

01:55:56.282 --> 01:55:57.283
ACCOUNTABLE FOR CONDUCTING

01:55:57.350 --> 01:55:58.751
THOROUGH AND HIGH QUALITY

01:55:58.818 --> 01:56:00.787
OVERSIGHT. HOWEVER, SB 414

01:56:00.853 --> 01:56:02.388
PROPOSES NO NEW METHODS TO

01:56:02.455 --> 01:56:03.323
ENSURE AUTHORIZER

01:56:03.389 --> 01:56:05.825
ACCOUNTABILITY. TO THAT END, THE

01:56:05.892 --> 01:56:07.060
ANALYSIS REALLY THOROUGHLY LISTS

01:56:07.126 --> 01:56:09.062
MANY OTHER MISSING PIECES, AND

01:56:09.128 --> 01:56:10.630
FOR THESE REASONS, WE REMAIN

01:56:10.697 --> 01:56:12.732
OPPOSED TO SB 414, BUT WE LOOK

01:56:12.799 --> 01:56:14.934
FORWARD TO CONTINUING PRODUCTIVE

01:56:15.001 --> 01:56:15.935
CONVERSATIONS THROUGH SUMMER

01:56:16.002 --> 01:56:17.870
RECESS ON HOW TO BEST PROTECT

01:56:17.937 --> 01:56:19.839
STUDENTS AND ENSURE INTEGRITY IN

01:56:19.906 --> 01:56:21.407
OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM.

01:56:21.474 --> 01:56:25.078
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. HELLO, MR.

01:56:25.144 --> 01:56:25.945
CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE

01:56:26.012 --> 01:56:27.580
COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS NICOLE

01:56:27.647 --> 01:56:28.981
PIPER. I'M A TEACHER AT

01:56:29.048 --> 01:56:30.016
CALIFORNIA VIRTUAL ACADEMIES,

01:56:30.083 --> 01:56:31.651
ALSO CALLED CAVA, WHICH IS A

01:56:31.718 --> 01:56:33.619
FULLY VIRTUAL NON-CLASSROOM

01:56:33.686 --> 01:56:35.188
BASED CHARTER SCHOOL. I ALSO

01:56:35.254 --> 01:56:36.556
SERVE AS PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA

01:56:36.622 --> 01:56:38.658
VIRTUAL EDUCATORS UNITED,

01:56:38.725 --> 01:56:40.460
REPRESENTING OVER 1100 EDUCATORS

01:56:40.526 --> 01:56:42.228
ACROSS THE CAVA NETWORK, AS WELL

01:56:42.295 --> 01:56:44.130
AS INSIGHT AND IQ SCHOOLS

01:56:44.197 --> 01:56:45.698
SERVING OVER 14,000 STUDENTS IN

01:56:45.765 --> 01:56:47.700
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I'VE

01:56:47.767 --> 01:56:49.102
TAUGHT EVERY GRADE FROM

01:56:49.168 --> 01:56:50.436
KINDERGARTEN TO 12TH GRADE OVER

01:56:50.503 --> 01:56:52.305
MY 13 YEARS AS A VIRTUAL

01:56:52.372 --> 01:56:54.140
EDUCATOR, BUT MY PASSION IS

01:56:54.207 --> 01:56:55.508
REALLY READING INTERVENTION,

01:56:55.575 --> 01:56:56.943
HELPING OUR MOST STRUGGLING

01:56:57.009 --> 01:56:58.678
STUDENTS GAIN SKILLS AND FALL IN

01:56:58.745 --> 01:57:00.980
LOVE WITH READING. HOPEFULLY,

01:57:01.047 --> 01:57:03.816
VIRTUAL EDUCATION IS COMPLEX AND

01:57:03.883 --> 01:57:05.651
SPECIALIZED WORK. DURING THE

01:57:05.718 --> 01:57:07.086
PANDEMIC, I THINK MANY OF US GOT

01:57:07.153 --> 01:57:08.888
A VIEW OF WHAT THAT WORK LOOKS

01:57:08.955 --> 01:57:11.124
LIKE, HOW CHALLENGING AND HOW

01:57:11.190 --> 01:57:13.626
VITAL THE WORK IS. BUT

01:57:13.693 --> 01:57:14.627
UNFORTUNATELY, OUR SCHOOLS

01:57:14.694 --> 01:57:16.863
BUDGET DOES NOT REFLECT THAT. AT

01:57:16.929 --> 01:57:18.231
CAVA AND SCHOOLS LIKE OURS,

01:57:18.297 --> 01:57:19.532
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE SENT OUT

01:57:19.599 --> 01:57:20.867
OF STATE TO CONTRACTORS. INSTEAD

01:57:20.933 --> 01:57:22.702
OF STAYING IN THE CLASSROOM WITH

01:57:22.769 --> 01:57:24.137
OUR STUDENTS AND OUR TEACHERS.

01:57:24.203 --> 01:57:25.505
IT MIGHT NOT ALWAYS BE OUTRIGHT

01:57:25.571 --> 01:57:26.572
FRAUD LIKE WE'VE BEEN HEARING

01:57:26.639 --> 01:57:28.007
ABOUT TODAY, BUT IT'S STILL A

01:57:28.074 --> 01:57:30.076
SYSTEM THAT PRIORITIZES PRIVATE

01:57:30.143 --> 01:57:31.944
VENDORS OVER OUR STUDENTS AND

01:57:32.011 --> 01:57:33.045
OUR EDUCATORS HERE IN

01:57:33.112 --> 01:57:34.781
CALIFORNIA. THAT'S NOT THE WORST

01:57:34.847 --> 01:57:35.915
OF IT. IN THOSE TWO

01:57:35.982 --> 01:57:36.983
INVESTIGATIONS WE'VE HEARD

01:57:37.049 --> 01:57:38.418
ABOUT, THERE'S OVER HALF $1

01:57:38.484 --> 01:57:40.186
BILLION IN FRAUD, WASTE AND

01:57:40.253 --> 01:57:42.288
ABUSE IN THE NCB CHARTER SECTOR.

01:57:42.355 --> 01:57:43.923
THAT MONEY SHOULD HAVE GONE TO

01:57:43.990 --> 01:57:45.691
OUR STUDENTS FOR THEIR

01:57:45.758 --> 01:57:48.428
INSTRUCTION. THE LAO AND FCMAT

01:57:48.494 --> 01:57:50.963
GAVE YOU CLEAR EVIDENCE BASED

01:57:51.030 --> 01:57:52.165
RECOMMENDATIONS TO PREVENT

01:57:52.231 --> 01:57:54.867
FUTURE HARM, BUT SB 404 DOES NOT

01:57:54.934 --> 01:57:57.303
IMPLEMENT THEM. PASSING SB 404

01:57:57.370 --> 01:57:59.205
AS IT IS LETS CHARTER

01:57:59.272 --> 01:58:00.740
ADMINISTRATORS AND MANAGEMENT

01:58:00.807 --> 01:58:01.808
ORGANIZATIONS DECIDE FOR

01:58:01.874 --> 01:58:03.376
THEMSELVES WHICH RULES TO

01:58:03.443 --> 01:58:05.845
FOLLOW, RATHER THAN HOLDING THEM

01:58:05.912 --> 01:58:07.213
TO THE STANDARDS RECOMMENDED BY

01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:08.981
YOUR OWN OVERSIGHT AGENCIES.

01:58:09.048 --> 01:58:10.817
PLEASE REMEMBER THAT CHARTER

01:58:10.883 --> 01:58:12.185
SCHOOLS AREN'T JUST MADE UP OF

01:58:12.251 --> 01:58:13.986
ADMINISTRATORS AND CMOS, THAT

01:58:14.053 --> 01:58:16.189
THERE ARE HARDWORKING, DEDICATED

01:58:16.255 --> 01:58:18.524
EDUCATORS THERE TOO. AND VIRTUAL

01:58:18.591 --> 01:58:19.992
EDUCATORS LIKE ME ARE DOING OUR

01:58:20.059 --> 01:58:21.194
BEST WITH TOO LITTLE. WHILE

01:58:21.260 --> 01:58:23.029
MONEY GETS SIPHONED AWAY FROM

01:58:23.095 --> 01:58:25.598
OUR SCHOOLS, PASSING INCOMPLETE

01:58:25.665 --> 01:58:26.866
MEASURES THAT DON'T TAKE INTO

01:58:26.933 --> 01:58:28.868
ACCOUNT EDUCATOR VOICES LIKE SB

01:58:28.935 --> 01:58:30.336
404 AND THAT DON'T FULLY ADDRESS

01:58:30.403 --> 01:58:31.938
ALL THE ISSUES LEADING TO THE A3

01:58:32.004 --> 01:58:33.539

01:58:33.606 --> 01:58:34.974
RESULT IN CONTINUED FRAUD AND

01:58:35.041 --> 01:58:37.543

02:04:02.134 --> 02:04:04.670
THERE WERE SEVERAL VERY

02:04:04.737 --> 02:04:06.839
RESPECTFUL OR I'M VERY

02:04:06.906 --> 02:04:08.007
RESPECTFUL TO THE ANALYSIS THAT

THE LOUSE OFFICE PUT FORWARD ON

THIS ISSUE. AND THE ANALYSIS

02:04:13.946 --> 02:04:15.915
BEFORE US TODAY IDENTIFIES

02:04:15.981 --> 02:04:18.818
SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE

02:04:18.884 --> 02:04:22.288
LAO THAT ARE NOT IN

02:04:22.354 --> 02:04:23.055
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE NOT IN

02:04:23.122 --> 02:04:24.657
YOUR BILL. AND I JUST WOULD LIKE

02:04:24.723 --> 02:04:25.825
TO GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY

02:04:25.891 --> 02:04:28.460
BECAUSE SOME OF THEM ARE ARE

02:04:28.527 --> 02:04:29.528
QUITE SIGNIFICANT, AND WE COULD

02:04:29.595 --> 02:04:30.696
PROBABLY SPEND A GOOD AMOUNT OF

02:04:30.763 --> 02:04:32.398
TIME HERE, WHICH I WON'T ON

02:04:32.464 --> 02:04:34.900
EVERY ONE OF THESE. BUT MAYBE IF

02:04:34.967 --> 02:04:37.736
YOU COULD IDENTIFY A FEW THAT

02:04:37.803 --> 02:04:39.705
YOU THINK ARE IMPORTANT, PERHAPS

02:04:39.772 --> 02:04:41.507
WHERE YOU HAVE DISAGREEMENT WITH

02:04:41.574 --> 02:04:43.709
THE LAO ON. AND I'D LIKE TO HEAR

02:04:43.776 --> 02:04:45.644
WHAT YOUR PERSPECTIVE IS ON

02:04:45.711 --> 02:04:47.179
THAT. SO FIRST OF ALL, I'LL GIVE

02:04:47.246 --> 02:04:48.547
YOU A LITTLE BIT OF INFORMATION

02:04:48.614 --> 02:04:49.582
FROM MY VANTAGE POINT. AND THEN

02:04:49.648 --> 02:04:52.051
IF IT'S OKAY, OFFER ONE OF MY

02:04:52.117 --> 02:04:53.118
EXPERT WITNESSES INTO THE MORE

02:04:53.185 --> 02:04:54.486
DETAIL OF IT. BUT I WOULD JUST

02:04:54.553 --> 02:04:55.921
SAY THAT THERE ARE THERE ARE

02:04:55.988 --> 02:04:58.324
MANY COMPONENTS TO THE AUDITS

02:04:58.390 --> 02:04:59.758
THAT WE'RE STILL NEGOTIATING,

02:04:59.825 --> 02:05:01.627
WHICH I THINK YOU HEARD. THERE'S

02:05:01.694 --> 02:05:03.362
A FEW THINGS, EVEN IN THE

02:05:03.429 --> 02:05:04.797
LANGUAGE THAT WE'RE PUTTING

02:05:04.864 --> 02:05:07.466
FORWARD TODAY THAT'S INTENT

02:05:07.533 --> 02:05:08.834
LANGUAGE, WHICH IS HOPEFULLY

02:05:08.901 --> 02:05:10.569
IDENTIFYING FOR FOLKS THE NOTION

02:05:10.636 --> 02:05:12.104
THAT WE'RE NOT QUITE DONE ON

02:05:12.171 --> 02:05:13.372
THOSE ITEMS. THIS IS CERTAINLY

02:05:13.439 --> 02:05:14.707
ONE OF THOSE AREAS, ESPECIALLY

02:05:14.773 --> 02:05:16.775
AS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

02:05:16.842 --> 02:05:18.944
SMALLER AUTHORIZERS, WHICH IS I

02:05:19.011 --> 02:05:19.945
THINK. BUT YOU HEARD IT TODAY,

02:05:20.012 --> 02:05:21.814
RIGHT? WE JUST PUT THE INTENT

02:05:21.881 --> 02:05:23.949
LANGUAGE IN, AND YOU ALREADY HAD

02:05:24.016 --> 02:05:25.351
EIGHT PEOPLE LINE UP WITH

02:05:25.417 --> 02:05:27.887
CONCERN. SO WE'RE WE HAVE TO

02:05:27.953 --> 02:05:29.588
FIND THAT BALANCE. AND YOUR

02:05:29.655 --> 02:05:31.824
CHAIR AND MYSELF AND THE FOLKS

02:05:31.891 --> 02:05:33.525
THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS

02:05:33.592 --> 02:05:35.094
WEEKLY ARE VERY DEDICATED TO

02:05:35.160 --> 02:05:36.428
DOING THAT. THEY'RE JUST NOT

02:05:36.495 --> 02:05:38.063
QUITE THERE YET. SO IN THIS

02:05:38.130 --> 02:05:39.398
PARTICULAR BILL, IN FOR ONE FOR

02:05:39.465 --> 02:05:40.799
WHICH YOU HAVE IS THE INTENT

02:05:40.866 --> 02:05:42.801
LANGUAGE TO FIGURE OUT WHICH OF

02:05:42.868 --> 02:05:44.536
THOSE ITEMS WOULD WORK BEST AND

02:05:44.603 --> 02:05:46.171
HOW THEY WOULD MESH TOGETHER.

02:05:46.238 --> 02:05:47.806
AND ULTIMATELY, I THINK AT THE

02:05:47.873 --> 02:05:49.742
END OF THE DAY, CHAIR MURATSUCHI

02:05:49.808 --> 02:05:51.210
AND MYSELF WANT THE SAME

02:05:51.277 --> 02:05:52.478
OUTCOME. WE'RE JUST TRYING TO

02:05:52.544 --> 02:05:54.546
FIGURE OUT THE BEST ROUTE THERE,

02:05:54.613 --> 02:05:56.181
AND THE ONE THAT'S IMPLEMENTABLE

02:05:56.248 --> 02:05:58.017
IN THE TIME AND SPACE THAT WE

02:05:58.083 --> 02:05:59.652
LIVE IN TODAY, WHICH IS A DOWN

02:05:59.718 --> 02:06:01.787
BUDGET, A TOUGH BUDGET, AND A

02:06:01.854 --> 02:06:03.422
TIME WHERE WE NEED TO DO TWO

02:06:03.489 --> 02:06:04.924
THINGS HAVE OVERSIGHTS WE CAN

02:06:04.990 --> 02:06:05.991
AFFORD. NEITHER ONE OF US WANT A

02:06:06.058 --> 02:06:07.593
VETOED BILL. WE WANT ONE OF

02:06:07.660 --> 02:06:09.862
THESE TO MAKE IT RIGHT. AND TWO,

02:06:09.929 --> 02:06:12.264
WHERE WE PROTECT EVERY DOLLAR.

02:06:12.331 --> 02:06:13.299
BECAUSE I SYMPATHIZE SO MUCH

02:06:13.365 --> 02:06:14.833
WITH YOU ON THE HEADLINES. I'VE

02:06:14.900 --> 02:06:16.802
HAD A FEW MYSELF HERE OF LATE

02:06:16.869 --> 02:06:18.938
DAYS THAT I'M NOT PROUD OF IN

02:06:19.004 --> 02:06:21.206
OUR REGION, BUT WHAT WE DO ABOUT

02:06:21.273 --> 02:06:22.608
IT IS WHAT DEFINES US. RIGHT?

02:06:22.675 --> 02:06:24.410
AND SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE SO

02:06:24.476 --> 02:06:26.178
FOCUSED ON THE AUDIT GUIDELINES.

02:06:26.245 --> 02:06:28.247
WE'RE SO FOCUSED ON THINGS LIKE

02:06:28.314 --> 02:06:30.516
THE CLAUSES AROUND THE HIGHEST

02:06:30.582 --> 02:06:31.884
AMOUNTS PAID, THE TOP 25

02:06:31.951 --> 02:06:33.719
PAYMENTS, GIVING AUTHORIZERS

02:06:33.786 --> 02:06:36.588
MORE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY FOR

02:06:36.655 --> 02:06:37.656
THEMSELVES THINGS THAT THEY'D

02:06:37.723 --> 02:06:38.724
LIKE TO LOOK INTO MORE. WE'VE

02:06:38.791 --> 02:06:41.327
REALLY PUSHED VERY HARD ON THE

02:06:41.393 --> 02:06:42.695
AUDIT TRAINING COMPONENTS AND

02:06:42.761 --> 02:06:44.596
HOW WE GET AUDITORS PREPARED FOR

02:06:44.663 --> 02:06:46.031
THIS WORK. WE'RE TRYING TO FIND

02:06:46.098 --> 02:06:48.133
THAT BALANCE BETWEEN WHAT WE CAN

02:06:48.200 --> 02:06:51.103
DO THAT WOULD HONOR THE FINDINGS

02:06:51.170 --> 02:06:53.539
OF ALL THREE OF THE AUDITS, AND

02:06:53.605 --> 02:06:55.307
AT THE SAME TIME, BE

02:06:55.374 --> 02:06:56.642
IMPLEMENTABLE IN CALIFORNIA AND

02:06:56.709 --> 02:06:57.977
REALLY PRODUCE THE OUTCOMES

02:06:58.043 --> 02:07:00.179
WE'RE LOOKING FOR, WHICH IS TO

02:07:00.245 --> 02:07:02.247
HOLD ALL SCHOOLS REALLY

02:07:02.314 --> 02:07:03.015
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE DOLLARS THAT

02:07:03.082 --> 02:07:05.217
THE PRECIOUS FEW DOLLARS THAT WE

02:07:05.284 --> 02:07:07.086
HAVE TO GIVE TO EDUCATION IN

02:07:07.152 --> 02:07:08.821
THIS STATE AND MAKE SURE ALL OF

02:07:08.887 --> 02:07:10.823
THEM MAKE THEIR WAY TO STUDENTS.

02:07:10.889 --> 02:07:12.858
SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO,

02:07:12.925 --> 02:07:14.893
THROUGH THE CHAIR, HAVE EXPERT

02:07:14.960 --> 02:07:15.561
WITNESS OR IF THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH

02:07:15.627 --> 02:07:16.829
FOR YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT

02:07:16.895 --> 02:07:17.963
RESPONSE. IT'S DEFINITELY

02:07:18.030 --> 02:07:18.764
HELPFUL. I THINK THE SPIRIT IS

02:07:18.831 --> 02:07:20.632
VERY CLEAR, WHICH I APPRECIATE

02:07:20.699 --> 02:07:22.735
AS WELL, OF TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

02:07:22.801 --> 02:07:26.638
WHERE WE COULD TOGETHER GET TO A

02:07:26.705 --> 02:07:28.540
PLACE THAT IS, AS YOU SAID,

02:07:28.607 --> 02:07:29.908
IMPLEMENTABLE AND ACCOUNTABLE. I

02:07:29.975 --> 02:07:31.110
THINK THAT THAT CERTAINLY IS THE

02:07:31.176 --> 02:07:33.145
GOAL. THAT WAS CERTAINLY I'VE

02:07:33.212 --> 02:07:35.314
BEEN VERY CLEAR ABOUT MY

02:07:35.381 --> 02:07:36.949
PERSPECTIVE ON THIS ISSUE FROM

02:07:37.016 --> 02:07:39.485
OUR THE BILL THAT OUR CHAIR HAD.

02:07:39.551 --> 02:07:41.353
SO I THINK I APPRECIATE THAT. I

02:07:41.420 --> 02:07:43.122
THINK THAT DOES REQUIRE MORE

02:07:43.188 --> 02:07:45.424
WORK. MAYBE, MAYBE A BETTER

02:07:45.491 --> 02:07:46.892
QUESTION FOR YOU WOULD BE, ARE

02:07:46.959 --> 02:07:50.095
THERE ANY THAT ARE YOU SAID

02:07:50.162 --> 02:07:51.830
YOU'RE WORKING ON MOST OF THEM.

02:07:51.897 --> 02:07:54.299
ARE THERE ANY THAT ARE JUST WE

02:07:54.366 --> 02:07:55.834
SHOULD KNOW ABOUT NOW, AS YOU

02:07:55.901 --> 02:07:57.970
HEAD INTO THIS NEGOTIATION THAT

02:07:58.037 --> 02:08:00.172
ARE NON-NEGOTIABLES FOR YOU AS

02:08:00.239 --> 02:08:02.674
PART OF WHAT HAS BEEN OUTLINED

02:08:02.741 --> 02:08:04.443
IN THE ANALYSIS, AGAIN, MAINLY

02:08:04.510 --> 02:08:06.278
REFLECTED ON THE LAO

02:08:06.345 --> 02:08:06.945
RECOMMENDATIONS, INCLUDING

02:08:07.012 --> 02:08:08.814
THINGS LIKE FUNDING,

02:08:08.881 --> 02:08:11.350
DETERMINATION AND THE SMALL

02:08:11.417 --> 02:08:13.786
DISTRICT AUTHORIZATION. YEAH, I

02:08:13.852 --> 02:08:16.622
THINK FOR US, IT THERE'S NOT A

02:08:16.688 --> 02:08:18.991
SPECIFIC ITEM OUTLINED IN OR

02:08:19.058 --> 02:08:21.693
I'LL SAY FOR ME, BECAUSE

02:08:21.760 --> 02:08:22.995
WIELDING ONE OF THESE GROUPS

02:08:23.062 --> 02:08:25.297
THAT NO TWO MINDS. RIGHT. BUT

02:08:25.364 --> 02:08:26.632
WHAT I WOULD SAY TO YOU IS FROM

02:08:26.698 --> 02:08:27.766
AN AUTHOR'S STANDPOINT, I'M OPEN

02:08:27.833 --> 02:08:29.735
TO ALL DIALOG. AND I THINK

02:08:29.802 --> 02:08:30.669
ACTUALLY THE BILL WHERE IT SITS

02:08:30.736 --> 02:08:33.338
RIGHT NOW AND I WILL SAY BOTH

02:08:33.405 --> 02:08:34.740
BILLS AS THEY SIT RIGHT NOW, ARE

02:08:34.807 --> 02:08:35.507
PROBABLY VERY DIFFERENT THAN

02:08:35.574 --> 02:08:37.009
WHERE WE THOUGHT THEY WOULD SIT.

02:08:37.076 --> 02:08:38.644
SO I'M OPEN TO ANYTHING. BUT

02:08:38.710 --> 02:08:40.512
HERE'S WHAT I'M NOT OPEN TO. I'M

02:08:40.579 --> 02:08:42.214
NOT OPEN TO SOMETHING THAT'S SO

02:08:42.281 --> 02:08:43.649
PUNITIVE THAT ALL CHARTER

02:08:43.715 --> 02:08:45.150
SCHOOLS TAKE A HAIRCUT. NO

02:08:45.217 --> 02:08:46.885
MATTER WHAT'S HAPPENING. I THINK

02:08:46.952 --> 02:08:48.821
KIDS HAVE A VALUE. I'M VERY

02:08:48.887 --> 02:08:50.089
FOCUSED ON STUDENTS AND STUDENT

02:08:50.155 --> 02:08:51.924
OUTCOMES IN ALL OF THIS. THE

02:08:51.990 --> 02:08:53.492
REASON I EVEN TOOK UP THE BILL.

02:08:53.559 --> 02:08:55.594
I COME FROM A COMMUNITY. YOU SAW

02:08:55.661 --> 02:08:57.463
SOME OF MY SCHOOLS HERE TODAY,

02:08:57.529 --> 02:08:58.931
NATOMAS, AND I MEAN NOT JUST

02:08:58.997 --> 02:09:00.999
SACRAMENTO, BUT NATOMAS, WHERE

02:09:01.066 --> 02:09:02.501
CHARTER SCHOOLS AND TRADITIONAL

02:09:02.568 --> 02:09:04.002
PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE BOTH BELOVED.

02:09:04.069 --> 02:09:05.804
AND I HONESTLY FEEL LIKE A VERY

02:09:05.871 --> 02:09:07.773
LONG TIME CHAMPION OF BOTH. SO

02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:10.008
I, YOU KNOW, TRISTAN AND I ARE

02:09:10.075 --> 02:09:11.176
VERY GOOD FRIENDS. I'VE, I'VE

02:09:11.243 --> 02:09:12.811
BEEN WORKING IN THIS SPACE FOR A

02:09:12.878 --> 02:09:15.314
LONG TIME. I WANT KIDS TO FEEL

02:09:15.380 --> 02:09:16.381
VALUED IN EVERY SCHOOL. I'VE

02:09:16.448 --> 02:09:17.783
DONE TWO SCHOOL BOND MEASURES AS

02:09:17.850 --> 02:09:19.685
A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER IN MY OWN

02:09:19.751 --> 02:09:21.453
NAME FOR ALL THE SCHOOLS,

02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:22.921
BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT KIDS

02:09:22.988 --> 02:09:24.456
HAVE SAFE ENVIRONMENTS AND THAT

02:09:24.523 --> 02:09:26.425
AS MANY OF OUR DOLLARS AS WE CAN

02:09:26.492 --> 02:09:28.327
MAKE IT INTO THOSE CLASSROOMS.

02:09:28.393 --> 02:09:30.395
BUT I DON'T THINK KIDS SHOULD BE

02:09:30.462 --> 02:09:31.964
VALUED BASED ON WHICH SCHOOL

02:09:32.030 --> 02:09:34.066
THEY ARE AT. I DON'T THINK THAT

02:09:34.133 --> 02:09:35.968
THE PER DAILY ATTENDANCE VALUE

02:09:36.034 --> 02:09:38.537
OF A STUDENT IS LOWER BECAUSE OF

02:09:38.604 --> 02:09:40.272
WHERE THEY GO, AND I THINK

02:09:40.339 --> 02:09:41.974
THAT'S A PIECE WHERE WE WHERE I

02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:43.609
WOULD HOLD A LINE. I WOULDN'T

02:09:43.675 --> 02:09:44.943
SAY I'VE RECEIVED A LOT OF

02:09:45.010 --> 02:09:46.912
PUSHBACK, BUT I WOULD SAY THAT'S

02:09:46.979 --> 02:09:48.680
BEEN A PIECE ON THE DETERMINANTS

02:09:48.747 --> 02:09:49.815
THAT I THINK WE WOULD HOLD THE

02:09:49.882 --> 02:09:53.085
LINE ON. I THINK MAKING SURE WE

02:09:53.152 --> 02:09:54.686
IDENTIFY FOLKS THAT ARE BAD

02:09:54.753 --> 02:09:56.455
ACTORS WHERE DOLLARS ARE BEING

02:09:56.522 --> 02:09:58.123
SPENT, IT'S TOTALLY

02:09:58.190 --> 02:09:59.158
UNACCEPTABLE. THESE HEADLINES

02:09:59.224 --> 02:10:00.692
THAT YOU HAVE IN SAN DIEGO, THE

02:10:00.759 --> 02:10:02.127
HEADLINES THAT I HAVE IN

02:10:02.194 --> 02:10:03.996
SACRAMENTO, COMPLETELY

02:10:04.062 --> 02:10:05.497
UNACCEPTABLE. WE CAN'T WE CAN'T.

02:10:05.564 --> 02:10:06.999
WE HAVE TO REACT TO THAT. WE

02:10:07.065 --> 02:10:08.767
HAVE TO REACT TO THAT. AND WE

02:10:08.834 --> 02:10:09.902
NEED STRONGER AUDITS AND

02:10:09.968 --> 02:10:10.802
OVERSIGHTS. AND I KNOW THERE'S

02:10:10.869 --> 02:10:13.105
STILL MORE WORK TO DO ON THIS

02:10:13.172 --> 02:10:14.806
BILL, WHICH I ACKNOWLEDGED AS AS

02:10:14.873 --> 02:10:17.042
I SAID HERE AND I THINK WAS ALSO

02:10:17.109 --> 02:10:17.776
SAID IN THE SENATE EDUCATION

02:10:17.843 --> 02:10:18.911
COMMITTEE EARLIER TODAY, WE KNOW

02:10:18.977 --> 02:10:20.712
WE HAVE A LITTLE MORE WORK TO

02:10:20.779 --> 02:10:24.149
DO, BUT HONESTLY, I'M I'M VERY

02:10:24.216 --> 02:10:26.285
ENCOURAGED BY WHERE WE ARE TODAY

02:10:26.351 --> 02:10:27.719
AND FEEL THAT THERE'S REALLY

02:10:27.786 --> 02:10:28.820
NOTHING THAT'S TOTALLY OFF THE

02:10:28.887 --> 02:10:31.390
TABLE. AS LONG AS STUDENTS ARE

02:10:31.456 --> 02:10:34.993
THE FOCUS. KIDS GET A WELL

02:10:35.060 --> 02:10:37.462
FUNDED PROGRAM AND THERE ARE FAR

02:10:37.529 --> 02:10:39.698
MORE OVERSIGHTS FOR THE SCHOOLS

02:10:39.765 --> 02:10:41.400
THAN THERE ARE RIGHT NOW. DO YOU

02:10:41.466 --> 02:10:42.834
THINK THE AUDITING STANDARDS ARE

02:10:42.901 --> 02:10:44.102
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT? WE FOUGHT

02:10:44.169 --> 02:10:46.071
HARD FOR THOSE AS WELL. OKAY,

02:10:46.138 --> 02:10:47.606
WELL THEN MAYBE WHAT WOULD MAKE

02:10:47.673 --> 02:10:48.974
MORE SENSE? APPRECIATE THE

02:10:49.041 --> 02:10:50.943
RESPONSE TO THAT. IS, IS FOR ME

02:10:51.009 --> 02:10:51.810
TO REITERATE WHAT I'VE ALREADY

02:10:51.877 --> 02:10:54.746
SAID. SO NOTHING NEW HERE. YOU

02:10:54.813 --> 02:10:56.949
KNOW, A SMALL DISTRICT, AS IS

02:10:57.015 --> 02:10:58.550
POINTED OUT IN OUR ANALYSIS ON

02:10:58.617 --> 02:11:01.153
PAGE EIGHT, NEW JERUSALEM

02:11:01.220 --> 02:11:02.654
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT, WITH

02:11:02.721 --> 02:11:05.290
22 STUDENTS OVERSEEING A 4500

02:11:05.357 --> 02:11:08.393
CHARTER SCHOOL SYSTEM. WHEN

02:11:08.460 --> 02:11:10.195
YOU'VE GOT PROBABLY THE

02:11:10.262 --> 02:11:10.963
SUPERINTENDENT BEING THE

02:11:11.029 --> 02:11:12.364
PRINCIPAL AND PERHAPS THE

02:11:12.431 --> 02:11:13.799
CUSTODIAN AND THE NURSE, I DON'T

02:11:13.865 --> 02:11:16.335
KNOW, REALLY SEEMS LIKE PERHAPS

02:11:16.401 --> 02:11:18.103
SOMETHING COULD BE DONE TO, TO,

02:11:18.170 --> 02:11:19.605
TO FIX THAT. SO YOU DIDN'T

02:11:19.671 --> 02:11:20.639
ADDRESS THAT SPECIFICALLY. BUT I

02:11:20.706 --> 02:11:23.141
WOULD SAY THAT'S CERTAINLY

02:11:23.208 --> 02:11:23.942
SOMETHING I WOULD BE LOOKING TO

02:11:24.009 --> 02:11:25.010
IN WHATEVER FINAL ITERATION OF

02:11:25.077 --> 02:11:29.815
THIS IS. FUNDING, DETERMINATION,

02:11:29.881 --> 02:11:30.682
RECALLING FOR EVERYBODY. WE'RE

02:11:30.749 --> 02:11:32.217
NOT TALKING ABOUT ALL CHARTER

02:11:32.284 --> 02:11:33.485
SCHOOLS, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:11:33.552 --> 02:11:34.886
NON-CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER

02:11:34.953 --> 02:11:36.455
SCHOOLS THAT HAVE A DIFFERENT

02:11:36.521 --> 02:11:38.690
MODEL THAN THAN ALL CHARTER

02:11:38.757 --> 02:11:40.392
SCHOOLS. AND I AND I WANT TO

02:11:40.459 --> 02:11:42.127
JUST REITERATE, I LIKE YOU AND I

02:11:42.194 --> 02:11:44.196
THINK FROM EVERYBODY I'VE HEARD,

02:11:44.263 --> 02:11:44.896
NOBODY'S TRYING TO PENALIZE

02:11:44.963 --> 02:11:48.100
THOSE THAT ARE TEACHING OUR KIDS

02:11:48.166 --> 02:11:49.801
IN TRADITIONAL SCHOOL SETTINGS.

02:11:49.868 --> 02:11:51.770
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NON-CHARTER

02:11:51.837 --> 02:11:53.705
NON CLASSROOM BASED SETTINGS.

02:11:53.772 --> 02:11:54.973
THOSE ARE THOSE ARE DIFFERENT.

02:11:55.040 --> 02:11:56.541
AND I THINK I HOPE THAT YOU

02:11:56.608 --> 02:11:58.877
WOULD BE OPEN TO THAT. AND THEN

02:11:58.944 --> 02:12:01.647
THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY IS,

02:12:01.713 --> 02:12:04.182
YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE, THE

02:12:04.249 --> 02:12:08.020
ISSUES ON SOME OF THE FIELD

02:12:08.086 --> 02:12:09.921
TRIPS AND EXTRACURRICULAR

02:12:09.988 --> 02:12:11.923
ACTIVITIES THAT ARE NORMAL

02:12:11.990 --> 02:12:13.859
SCHOOL KIDS. AS YOU SAID, WE

02:12:13.925 --> 02:12:15.227
SHOULD BE TREATING FOLKS AS

02:12:15.294 --> 02:12:16.995
CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE TO THE SAME.

02:12:17.062 --> 02:12:18.830
YOU KNOW, WE DON'T HAVE PROGRAMS

02:12:18.897 --> 02:12:22.167
WHERE KIDS CAN TAKE TRIPS TO

02:12:22.234 --> 02:12:23.902
THEME PARKS AND THINGS LIKE

02:12:23.969 --> 02:12:26.438
THAT. ON BASED ON AN LCFF

02:12:26.505 --> 02:12:28.540
FUNDING. SO THOSE THREE, I THINK

02:12:28.607 --> 02:12:30.909
ARE IMPORTANT. BUT, YOU KNOW, I,

02:12:30.976 --> 02:12:34.379
I APPRECIATE YOU BEING SO OPEN

02:12:34.446 --> 02:12:36.581
HERE WITH US PUBLICLY ABOUT THE

02:12:36.648 --> 02:12:37.783
WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. I

02:12:37.849 --> 02:12:39.584
THINK WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AT

02:12:39.651 --> 02:12:41.520
LEAST WHEN I SPOKE ON BEHALF OF

02:12:41.586 --> 02:12:42.888
OUR CHAIRS BILL ON THE FLOOR OF

02:12:42.954 --> 02:12:45.223
THE ASSEMBLY, WORK NEEDS TO BE

02:12:45.290 --> 02:12:46.658
DONE. AND I AM ENCOURAGED BY

02:12:46.725 --> 02:12:47.826
BOTH OF YOU GETTING US TO A

02:12:47.893 --> 02:12:50.495
PLACE WHERE WE ALL WILL BE IN

02:12:50.562 --> 02:12:51.129
THE SAME PLACE OF

02:12:51.196 --> 02:12:53.432
ACCOUNTABILITY, TRANSPARENCY,

02:12:53.498 --> 02:12:54.800
TRANSPARENCY, AND SERVING ALL

02:12:54.866 --> 02:12:55.967
STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. SO I

02:12:56.034 --> 02:12:58.070
THANK YOU FOR THAT. I APPRECIATE

02:12:58.136 --> 02:12:59.771
THAT, AND I WOULD AGREE WITH

02:12:59.838 --> 02:13:01.006
ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT YOU SAID,

02:13:01.073 --> 02:13:02.140
ESPECIALLY THE SMALL

02:13:02.207 --> 02:13:02.774
AUTHORIZERS. I THINK WE'RE JUST

02:13:02.841 --> 02:13:05.377
TRYING TO FIND THE LINE. THE

02:13:05.444 --> 02:13:07.245
EXAMPLE YOU GAVE IS A VERY CLEAR

02:13:07.312 --> 02:13:07.913
EXAMPLE, BUT THERE'S SOME OTHER,

02:13:07.979 --> 02:13:09.715
YOU KNOW, ON THAT SPECTRUM WHERE

02:13:09.781 --> 02:13:11.817
IS THE RIGHT LINE FOR US AND HOW

02:13:11.883 --> 02:13:12.918
DO WE ADDRESS IT? ACTUALLY,

02:13:12.984 --> 02:13:14.286
CHELSEA, IAN AND AMAYA HAVE MADE

02:13:14.353 --> 02:13:15.454
GREAT GAINS IN THAT AREA. I

02:13:15.520 --> 02:13:17.322
DON'T HAVE ANY DOUBT THAT WE

02:13:17.389 --> 02:13:18.757
WILL WILL WILL LAND ON THAT

02:13:18.824 --> 02:13:20.392
ANSWER. WE'RE JUST NOT QUITE

02:13:20.459 --> 02:13:21.827
THERE YET. THE ONLY PIECE I

02:13:21.893 --> 02:13:23.261
WOULD PUSH BACK A LITTLE BIT ON

02:13:23.328 --> 02:13:28.066
IS THE HYBRID EDUCATION SYSTEM.

02:13:28.133 --> 02:13:29.568
SOMETIMES WHAT IT TAKES TO WORK

02:13:29.634 --> 02:13:31.870
WITH A STUDENT WHO'S IN A HYBRID

02:13:31.937 --> 02:13:33.972
SITUATION CAN COST EVEN MORE

02:13:34.039 --> 02:13:35.574
THAN A TRADITIONAL CLASSROOM

02:13:35.640 --> 02:13:36.575
SETTING. DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU'RE

02:13:36.641 --> 02:13:38.910
DEALING WITH. DEPENDS ON IF IT'S

02:13:38.977 --> 02:13:40.645
A JUSTICE INVOLVED KIDDO OR A

02:13:40.712 --> 02:13:42.814
SPECIAL NEEDS KIDDO, OR A KIDDO

02:13:42.881 --> 02:13:44.583
WHO'S DEALING WITH SOME MEDICAL

02:13:44.649 --> 02:13:45.884
ISSUES. SOMETIMES THESE ARE

02:13:45.951 --> 02:13:47.986
REALLY CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENTS,

02:13:48.053 --> 02:13:49.087
AND I DON'T THINK THERE SHOULD

02:13:49.154 --> 02:13:51.456
BE AN AUTOMATIC TRIGGER THAT

02:13:51.523 --> 02:13:54.059
THAT CHILD'S EDUCATIONAL EXPENSE

02:13:54.126 --> 02:13:56.395
IS LOWER. IN FACT, SOMETIMES IT

02:13:56.461 --> 02:13:58.530
MAY BE HIGHER. SO I JUST THINK

02:13:58.597 --> 02:14:00.832
WE NEED TO BE OPEN TO THAT. I

02:14:00.899 --> 02:14:02.734
AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT. I KNOW

02:14:02.801 --> 02:14:03.535
THERE ARE MODELS. I'VE SEEN

02:14:03.602 --> 02:14:04.903
THEM, I'VE HEARD FROM THEM. I

02:14:04.970 --> 02:14:07.105
KNOW THEY ARE IN MY OWN BACKYARD

02:14:07.172 --> 02:14:07.873
THAT ARE DEALING WITH THOSE

02:14:07.939 --> 02:14:09.274
SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND

02:14:09.341 --> 02:14:10.208
ACKNOWLEDGE THE WORK THAT

02:14:10.275 --> 02:14:11.109
THEY'VE DONE AND HOW SUCCESSFUL

02:14:11.176 --> 02:14:12.711
THEY ARE, AND YOU DEFINITELY

02:14:12.778 --> 02:14:15.180
DON'T WANT TO STYMIE OR

02:14:15.247 --> 02:14:17.315
ELIMINATE THAT POTENTIAL

02:14:17.382 --> 02:14:19.317
INNOVATION THAT'S HAPPENING. BUT

02:14:19.384 --> 02:14:20.485
AT THE SAME TIME, THERE'S THERE

02:14:20.552 --> 02:14:22.788
THERE HAS TO BE. AGAIN, AS YOU

02:14:22.854 --> 02:14:24.389
SAID, A LINE DRAWN AS TO WHO

02:14:24.456 --> 02:14:26.091
WHAT ARE THOSE MODELS THAT ARE

02:14:26.158 --> 02:14:27.793
REALLY INVESTING IN THAT WAY AND

02:14:27.859 --> 02:14:29.428
LET'S SUPPORT THOSE. BUT NOT

02:14:29.494 --> 02:14:36.902
EVERYBODY IS THE SAME. SO I'M

02:14:36.968 --> 02:14:38.203
LOOKING. FORWARD TO YOUR WORK

02:14:38.270 --> 02:14:40.705
OVER THE NEXT MONTH BEFORE WE

02:14:40.772 --> 02:14:41.840
SEE. THANK YOU FOR DIGGING IN,

02:14:41.907 --> 02:14:44.509
TRULY. THANK YOU. BEFORE WE

02:14:44.576 --> 02:14:47.946

COLLEAGUE MENTIONED, SOMETIMES

02:16:06.491 --> 02:16:09.494
IT'S A VERY, VERY MICRO

02:16:09.561 --> 02:16:11.963
ESSENTIAL SCHOOL DISTRICT WHOSE

02:16:12.030 --> 02:16:13.365

02:16:13.431 --> 02:16:14.633
ROLES AND REALLY DOESN'T HAVE

02:16:14.699 --> 02:16:17.335
THE CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT THE

02:16:17.402 --> 02:16:18.436
AMOUNT OF OVERSIGHT AND

02:16:18.503 --> 02:16:20.238
ACCOUNTABILITY THAT'S REQUIRED

EVERYONE'S TRYING TO COMPLY. BUT

02:16:29.814 --> 02:16:31.416
THERE JUST ISN'T CAPACITY. SO WE

02:16:31.483 --> 02:16:32.717
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE

02:16:32.784 --> 02:16:33.885
THAT ARE AUTHORIZING CHARTERS

02:16:33.952 --> 02:16:35.253

ACCOUNTABILITY IS A GOOD THING,

02:17:24.769 --> 02:17:26.871
AND I THINK A PROCESS THAT STAYS

02:17:26.938 --> 02:17:28.306
FOCUSED ON THAT ACCOUNTABILITY

02:17:28.373 --> 02:17:30.108
WHILE PRESERVING EDUCATIONAL

02:17:30.175 --> 02:17:31.476
OPTIONS FOR FAMILIES IS REALLY

02:17:31.543 --> 02:17:33.044

WE KNOW THAT I'M HEARING, YOU

02:18:01.172 --> 02:18:03.975

02:18:04.042 --> 02:18:05.710
EXTENSIVE CONVERSATION ON THIS

02:18:05.777 --> 02:18:06.845
SUBJECT MATTER THIS MORNING. AND

THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE,

02:18:09.381 --> 02:18:12.917

02:18:12.984 --> 02:18:14.319
TO WHERE DO WE STRIKE THE

02:18:14.386 --> 02:18:17.255
BALANCE BETWEEN CHARTER SCHOOL

02:18:17.322 --> 02:18:19.791
FLEXIBILITY AND NECESSARY

02:18:19.858 --> 02:18:27.332
OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY. I

02:18:27.399 --> 02:18:31.302
BELIEVE THAT WE SHARE, YOU KNOW,

02:18:31.369 --> 02:18:36.307
THE BASIC GOALS AND PRINCIPLES

02:18:36.374 --> 02:18:38.143
OF ACHIEVING BOTH OF THOSE

02:18:38.209 --> 02:18:45.450
GOALS. BUT THE WHERE WE STRIKE

02:18:45.517 --> 02:18:48.920
THE BALANCE IS THE EXACT SUBJECT

02:18:48.987 --> 02:18:54.325

02:18:54.392 --> 02:18:59.431

02:19:01.199 --> 02:19:04.736
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN YOUR MEASURE

02:19:04.803 --> 02:19:10.475
AND MY BILL IS THAT MY BILL

02:19:10.542 --> 02:19:12.310
ATTEMPTED TO INCORPORATE ALL OF

02:19:12.377 --> 02:19:14.846

02:19:14.913 --> 02:19:17.248

COMMITTEE ADDRESSES SOME OF THE

02:19:28.226 --> 02:19:30.395

02:19:30.462 --> 02:19:34.733
GOES TO THAT FUNDAMENTAL

02:19:34.799 --> 02:19:35.734
CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE HAVING

02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:38.269
IN TERMS OF WHERE WE STRIKE THE

02:19:38.336 --> 02:19:41.806
BALANCE. AND I KNOW THAT WE ARE

02:19:41.873 --> 02:19:45.210
ALL WORKING HARD TO TRY TO

02:19:45.276 --> 02:19:49.047

02:19:49.114 --> 02:19:52.784

02:30:02.593 --> 02:30:04.295
CALIFORNIA MUST STAND READY. MY

02:30:04.362 --> 02:30:06.297
DAD USED TO TELL ME AS A KID, IF

02:30:06.364 --> 02:30:07.998
YOU STAY READY, YOU DON'T HAVE

02:30:08.065 --> 02:30:11.135
TO GET READY. SB 743 CREATES A

02:30:11.202 --> 02:30:12.670
STATEWIDE ENDOWMENT FUND WHERE

02:30:12.737 --> 02:30:14.772
MONEY IS RESPONSIBLY INVESTED TO

02:30:14.839 --> 02:30:18.075
CREATE LONG TERM EDUCATIONAL

02:30:18.142 --> 02:30:20.878
FUNDING. THIS IS NOT A PARTIZAN

02:30:20.945 --> 02:30:23.280
IDEA, IT'S A PRUDENT ONE. I URGE

02:30:23.347 --> 02:30:26.684
A YES VOTE FOR SB 743 TO BUILD A

02:30:26.751 --> 02:30:28.586
STRONGER CALIFORNIA EDUCATION

02:30:28.652 --> 02:30:32.022
SYSTEM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

02:30:32.089 --> 02:30:33.090
PUBLIC COMMENTS IN SUPPORT OF

02:30:33.157 --> 02:30:34.225
THE MEASURE, PLEASE COME

02:30:34.291 --> 02:30:40.798
FORWARD. GOOD AFTERNOON, CHAIR

02:30:40.865 --> 02:30:42.566
AND MEMBERS, ON BEHALF OF THE

02:30:42.633 --> 02:30:45.403
SILICON VALLEY COMMUNITY

02:30:45.469 --> 02:30:48.973
FOUNDATION AND STRONG SUPPORT.

02:30:49.039 --> 02:30:49.707
GOOD AFTERNOON, CHAIR AND

02:30:49.774 --> 02:30:50.941
MEMBERS, NICO MOLINA, ON BEHALF

02:30:51.008 --> 02:30:53.077
OF THE SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP

02:30:53.144 --> 02:30:55.613
GROUP IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU.

02:30:55.679 --> 02:30:56.914
THANK YOU. SEEING NO FURTHER

02:30:56.981 --> 02:30:57.882
PUBLIC COMMENTS IN SUPPORT OF

02:30:57.948 --> 02:31:00.084
THE MEASURE. ANY WITNESSES IN

02:31:00.151 --> 02:31:13.130
OPPOSITION, PLEASE COME FORWARD.

02:31:13.197 --> 02:31:16.066
TO THE SEPARATE TOGETHER. GOOD

02:31:16.133 --> 02:31:16.700
AFTERNOON, CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF

02:31:16.767 --> 02:31:18.335
THE COMMITTEE, DAN MERWIN WITH

02:31:18.402 --> 02:31:19.870
THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS

02:31:19.937 --> 02:31:21.071
ASSOCIATION. I'D LIKE TO FIRST

02:31:21.138 --> 02:31:22.139
START BY THANKING THE SENATOR

02:31:22.206 --> 02:31:23.541
FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD,

02:31:23.607 --> 02:31:24.575
ADDRESSING THE SYSTEMATIC

02:31:24.642 --> 02:31:26.043
FUNDING DISPARITIES THAT EXIST

02:31:26.110 --> 02:31:27.445
WITHIN BETWEEN DISTRICTS, EVEN

02:31:27.511 --> 02:31:29.613
WITH LCFF, IS COMPLEX AND AN

02:31:29.680 --> 02:31:31.115
ISSUE THAT DESERVES ATTENTION.

02:31:31.182 --> 02:31:32.550
AND WE APPLAUD THE SENATOR, HIS

02:31:32.616 --> 02:31:33.651
STAFF AND THE SPONSORS FOR

02:31:33.717 --> 02:31:36.220
RAISING THE ISSUE. KSBA IS NOT

02:31:36.287 --> 02:31:37.588
OPPOSED TO EQUALIZATION, BUT

02:31:37.655 --> 02:31:40.057
RATHER THE MECHANICS OF SB 743.

02:31:40.124 --> 02:31:42.159
IN OUR VIEW, ANY SOLUTION TO THE

02:31:42.226 --> 02:31:42.793
EQUALIZATION PROBLEM NEEDS TO BE

02:31:42.860 --> 02:31:44.261
BOTH GUARANTEED AND CONSISTENT,

02:31:44.328 --> 02:31:45.729
AND THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS

02:31:45.796 --> 02:31:47.698
TO ENSURE THE FUNDING IS

02:31:47.765 --> 02:31:49.333
CAPTURED WITHIN PROP 98, THE

02:31:49.400 --> 02:31:49.900
REQUIREMENT THAT ANY FUNDING

02:31:49.967 --> 02:31:51.635
GENERATED UNDER SB 743 BE

02:31:51.702 --> 02:31:52.837
EXCLUDED FROM PROP 98 REMOVES

02:31:52.903 --> 02:31:54.472
THOSE PROTECTIONS, WHICH WOULD

02:31:54.538 --> 02:31:55.573
OTHERWISE GUARANTEE THE FUNDING

02:31:55.639 --> 02:31:57.675
IS ALLOCATED TO SCHOOLS, THAT IT

02:31:57.741 --> 02:31:59.176
GROWS WITH INFLATION AND CHANGES

02:31:59.243 --> 02:32:00.077
IN ATTENDANCE, AND THAT IT IS

02:32:00.144 --> 02:32:01.712
NOT REPURPOSED FOR OTHER USES.

02:32:01.779 --> 02:32:02.913
WE'D ALSO FLAG THAT THIS

02:32:02.980 --> 02:32:03.948
EXEMPTION RAISES A LARGER

02:32:04.014 --> 02:32:05.049
QUESTION ABOUT THE ABILITY OF

02:32:05.115 --> 02:32:06.584
THE STATE TO ADOPT MECHANISMS

02:32:06.650 --> 02:32:08.452
THAT FUND SCHOOLS, CONTRARY TO

02:32:08.519 --> 02:32:09.019
THE INTENT OF 98, THEREBY

02:32:09.086 --> 02:32:11.021
WEAKENING 98. OVERALL, WE

02:32:11.088 --> 02:32:12.122
SUGGEST A SIMPLER SOLUTION WOULD

02:32:12.189 --> 02:32:13.791
BE TO INCREASE PROP 98 FUNDING

02:32:13.858 --> 02:32:15.826
AND THEN USE THAT FUNDING TO

02:32:15.893 --> 02:32:16.827
INCREASE THE LCFF BASE GRANT,

02:32:16.894 --> 02:32:17.895
WHICH WOULD THEN GROW OVER TIME

02:32:17.962 --> 02:32:19.763
WITH COLA. WE'D ALSO SUGGEST

02:32:19.830 --> 02:32:20.498
CONSIDERING THE ADEQUACY OF

02:32:20.564 --> 02:32:22.266
SCHOOL FUNDING UNDER LCFF IN

02:32:22.333 --> 02:32:23.267
GENERAL, AND INCLUDING

02:32:23.334 --> 02:32:24.802
EQUALIZATION AS PART OF THAT

02:32:24.869 --> 02:32:25.803
DISCUSSION TO ADDRESS THE VERY

02:32:25.870 --> 02:32:27.238
ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED HERE.

02:32:27.304 --> 02:32:28.772
THAT CONVERSATION COULD THEN

02:32:28.839 --> 02:32:29.740
FOCUS ON ENSURING ADEQUATE

02:32:29.807 --> 02:32:30.474
EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR

02:32:30.541 --> 02:32:31.942
ALL CHILDREN IN THE STATE,

02:32:32.009 --> 02:32:33.477
REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY LIVE,

02:32:33.544 --> 02:32:34.745
AND KSBA WOULD BE HAPPY TO LEND

02:32:34.812 --> 02:32:36.614
ITS EXPERTISE EXPERTISE TO ANY

02:32:36.680 --> 02:32:38.482
SUCH CONVERSATION. FOR THOSE

02:32:38.549 --> 02:32:41.685
REASONS, WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR

02:32:41.752 --> 02:32:47.725
A NO VOTE. ON BEHALF OF THE

02:32:47.791 --> 02:32:48.893
CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS

02:32:48.959 --> 02:32:49.660
ASSOCIATION. WE HAVE A TWEENER

02:32:49.727 --> 02:32:51.061
POSITION HERE. WE'RE OPPOSED

02:32:51.128 --> 02:32:52.530
UNLESS AMENDED. I WANT TO BE

02:32:52.596 --> 02:32:53.764
CLEAR WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE

02:32:53.831 --> 02:32:55.799
ISSUES WITH THE POLICY IN CHIEF

02:32:55.866 --> 02:32:56.834
IN THIS BILL. WE ACTUALLY AGREE

02:32:56.901 --> 02:32:57.668
COMPLETELY WITH THE SENATOR'S

02:32:57.735 --> 02:32:59.270
STATED GOAL OF MAKING SURE THAT

02:32:59.336 --> 02:33:00.104
THE STATE'S SCHOOL FUNDING

02:33:00.170 --> 02:33:01.405
SYSTEM IS MORE EQUITABLE, NO

02:33:01.472 --> 02:33:02.773
MATTER WHERE A STUDENT ATTENDS

02:33:02.840 --> 02:33:04.108
SCHOOL. WE COMPLETELY AGREE WITH

02:33:04.174 --> 02:33:05.342
THAT. THIS BILL SEEKS TO CREATE

02:33:05.409 --> 02:33:06.577
A PROGRAM THAT WILL

02:33:06.644 --> 02:33:07.745
ASPIRATIONALLY FUND NON-BASIC

02:33:07.811 --> 02:33:08.846
AID SCHOOLS AT LEVELS CLOSER TO

02:33:08.913 --> 02:33:12.149
WHAT A BASIC AID SCHOOL DISTRICT

02:33:12.216 --> 02:33:14.518
IS ABLE TO RECEIVE. AND WE THINK

02:33:14.585 --> 02:33:15.819
THAT'S GREAT. HOWEVER, WE'RE

02:33:15.886 --> 02:33:17.154
CONCERNED WITH THE ELIGIBILITY

02:33:17.221 --> 02:33:18.022
OF THE PROGRAM THAT IS BEING

02:33:18.088 --> 02:33:19.590
CREATED HERE. CURRENTLY, IT

02:33:19.657 --> 02:33:20.424
INCLUDES NON-BASIC AID

02:33:20.491 --> 02:33:21.458
DISTRICTS. IT DOES NOT INCLUDE

02:33:21.525 --> 02:33:22.092
DIRECT FUNDED CHARTER SCHOOLS,

02:33:22.159 --> 02:33:23.127
DIRECT FUNDED CHARTER SCHOOLS

02:33:23.193 --> 02:33:25.162
ARE FUNDED ESSENTIALLY AT THE

02:33:25.229 --> 02:33:26.730
SAME LEVELS AS NON-BASIC AID

02:33:26.797 --> 02:33:27.498
SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND SO WE'RE

02:33:27.565 --> 02:33:29.066
CONCERNED WE SEE THAT AS AN

02:33:29.133 --> 02:33:30.501
EQUITY ISSUE. WE'RE SENSITIVE TO

02:33:30.568 --> 02:33:31.502
THIS BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN CHARTER

02:33:31.569 --> 02:33:32.803
SCHOOLS SOMETIMES CUT OUT OF

02:33:32.870 --> 02:33:34.071
CERTAIN FUNDING STREAMS, AND SO

02:33:34.138 --> 02:33:35.739
WE'RE UNABLE TO ACCESS CERTAIN

02:33:35.806 --> 02:33:36.840
FUNDING, AND OUR STUDENTS ARE

02:33:36.907 --> 02:33:37.841
UNABLE TO ACCESS CERTAIN

02:33:37.908 --> 02:33:38.742
PROGRAMS. AS A RESULT. WE WANT

02:33:38.809 --> 02:33:40.744
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T

02:33:40.811 --> 02:33:41.912
CREATE SUCH AN INEQUITY. THE

02:33:41.979 --> 02:33:43.847
FIX, I THINK, IS PRETTY EASY. I

02:33:43.914 --> 02:33:44.982
THINK WE PROBABLY NEED TO JUST

02:33:45.049 --> 02:33:46.550
LOOK AT THE DEFINITION. THIS

02:33:46.617 --> 02:33:47.952
BILL PROBABLY NEEDS TO INCLUDE

02:33:48.018 --> 02:33:49.386
ALL NON-BASIC AID LEAS. IT

02:33:49.453 --> 02:33:50.020
LIKELY NEEDS TO INCLUDE DIRECT

02:33:50.087 --> 02:33:51.989
FUNDED CHARTER SCHOOLS AND

02:33:52.056 --> 02:33:52.556
PROBABLY COUNTY OFFICES OF

02:33:52.623 --> 02:33:53.524
EDUCATION. AND SO I'D SAY I

02:33:53.591 --> 02:33:55.059
WOULD ENCOURAGE US TO TAKE A

02:33:55.125 --> 02:33:56.827
LOOK AT THAT AND MAYBE REDEFINE

02:33:56.894 --> 02:33:58.062
WHO IS ELIGIBLE. ANY ANY PUBLIC

02:33:58.128 --> 02:33:59.096
SCHOOL THAT DOESN'T RECEIVE

02:33:59.163 --> 02:34:00.431
BASIC AGE WOULD PROBABLY BE

02:34:00.497 --> 02:34:02.533
INCLUDED OR AMENDED IN THIS

02:34:02.600 --> 02:34:03.601
BILL. SO GIVEN THAT WE'VE MET

02:34:03.667 --> 02:34:05.169
WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE,

02:34:05.235 --> 02:34:06.904
THEY'VE STATED TO US THAT IT IS

02:34:06.971 --> 02:34:08.472
NOT THEIR INTENT TO EXCLUDE US.

02:34:08.539 --> 02:34:10.007
WE APPRECIATE THAT. I APPRECIATE

02:34:10.074 --> 02:34:11.976
THAT STATEMENT A LOT. AND SO WE

02:34:12.042 --> 02:34:12.876
LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO

02:34:12.943 --> 02:34:13.877
WORK WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE

02:34:13.944 --> 02:34:15.679
OVER RECESS AND TRYING TO SORT

02:34:15.746 --> 02:34:17.448
THIS OUT AS THIS MOVES FORWARD.

02:34:17.514 --> 02:34:18.382
SO REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TIME

02:34:18.449 --> 02:34:20.084
AND APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR. THANK

02:34:20.150 --> 02:34:21.218
YOU. THANK YOU. ANY PUBLIC

02:34:21.285 --> 02:34:22.653
COMMENTS IN OPPOSITION, PLEASE

02:34:22.720 --> 02:34:24.922
COME FORWARD. SARAH PETROWSKI,

02:34:24.989 --> 02:34:26.290
ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA

02:34:26.357 --> 02:34:27.424
ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL BUSINESS

02:34:27.491 --> 02:34:29.293
OFFICIALS, IN RESPECTFUL

02:34:29.360 --> 02:34:30.995
OPPOSITION, BASED ON THE REASONS

02:34:31.061 --> 02:34:31.996
ARTICULATED SO WELL BY MY

02:34:32.062 --> 02:34:33.597
COLLEAGUE AT THE SCHOOL BOARDS

02:34:33.664 --> 02:34:34.999
ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU. THANK

02:34:35.065 --> 02:34:38.168
YOU. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC

02:34:38.235 --> 02:34:41.171
COMMENTS, BRING IT BACK TO THE

02:34:41.238 --> 02:34:44.675
COMMITTEE, MR. ALVAREZ, I KNOW

02:34:44.742 --> 02:34:46.510
YOUR SUBJECT MATTER HERE, BUT

02:34:46.577 --> 02:34:50.080
DOCTOR PATEL. YEAH, THANK YOU

02:34:50.147 --> 02:34:51.515
FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD.

02:34:51.582 --> 02:34:53.317
I AM CERTAINLY INTRIGUED BY THE

02:34:53.384 --> 02:34:55.853
IDEA OF HAVING AN ENDOWMENT FOR

02:34:55.919 --> 02:34:57.655
OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION CHILDREN.

02:34:57.721 --> 02:35:00.124
THAT CONCEPT IS VERY INTRIGUING

02:35:00.190 --> 02:35:01.959
TO ME. WE KNOW VERY WELL IN

02:35:02.026 --> 02:35:04.094
PUBLIC EDUCATION THAT THE

02:35:04.161 --> 02:35:05.929
FUNDING IS INSUFFICIENT AND

02:35:05.996 --> 02:35:08.198
INADEQUATE. WE KNOW THAT PROP 98

02:35:08.265 --> 02:35:10.234
TRIES TO DO THAT BY CREATING A

02:35:10.300 --> 02:35:11.869
FLOOR. UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAVE

02:35:11.935 --> 02:35:13.871
SEEN THAT FLOOR USED AS A

02:35:13.937 --> 02:35:14.872
CEILING. THIS IS COMMON

02:35:14.938 --> 02:35:16.073
LANGUAGE. WE'VE HEARD IT MANY,

02:35:16.140 --> 02:35:18.042
MANY YEARS, AND IT'S

02:35:18.108 --> 02:35:19.176
CONSISTENTLY INADEQUATE YEAR

02:35:19.243 --> 02:35:21.445
OVER YEAR. FRANKLY, EVEN THE

02:35:21.512 --> 02:35:23.947
BASE IS INSUFFICIENT FOR OUR

02:35:24.014 --> 02:35:26.717
LCFF FUNDED SCHOOLS. SO A FEW

02:35:26.784 --> 02:35:29.319
QUESTIONS ON THE ACTUAL PLAN.

02:35:29.386 --> 02:35:31.155
I'M VERY CURIOUS ABOUT THIS ERA

02:35:31.221 --> 02:35:33.157
AND HOW IT WOULD PERFORM AND ACT

02:35:33.223 --> 02:35:36.093
AND BE MANAGED. CAN YOU CLARIFY

02:35:36.160 --> 02:35:37.995
FOR ME IN SIMPLE TERMS, WHERE

02:35:38.062 --> 02:35:40.130
WILL THE FUNDS BE SOURCED FROM,

02:35:40.197 --> 02:35:41.665
AND IS IT GOING TO CREATE

02:35:41.732 --> 02:35:44.468
RESENTMENT FROM THE NON PROP 98

02:35:44.535 --> 02:35:47.571
SIDE FUNDED PROGRAMS? I MEAN,

02:35:47.638 --> 02:35:50.808
IT'S ALWAYS POSSIBLE LIKE YOU

02:35:50.874 --> 02:35:52.643
KNOW ANY ANY BUDGET DISCUSSION

02:35:52.710 --> 02:35:54.445
WE'RE HAVING JUST LIKE THE ONES

02:35:54.511 --> 02:35:55.746
WE'RE HAVING NOW, THE ONE WE

02:35:55.813 --> 02:35:57.381
JUST CONCLUDED THAT THERE'S

02:35:57.448 --> 02:35:59.383
GOING TO BE COMPETITION IN SOME

02:35:59.450 --> 02:36:01.852
RIVALRY FOR GENERAL FUND, FOR

02:36:01.919 --> 02:36:03.921
LACK OF A BETTER WORD, SURPLUS

02:36:03.987 --> 02:36:05.989
OR DISCRETIONARY FUNDS THAT ARE

02:36:06.056 --> 02:36:07.791
AVAILABLE. WHAT THIS IS SAYING

02:36:07.858 --> 02:36:10.961
IS THAT WE CONTINUE TO GROW SUCH

02:36:11.028 --> 02:36:13.330
A YEAR OVER YEAR OVER YEAR,

02:36:13.397 --> 02:36:14.698
INCREASING DISPARITY BETWEEN

02:36:14.765 --> 02:36:15.999
BASIC AND NON-BASIC AID

02:36:16.066 --> 02:36:19.703
DISTRICTS THAT WE NEED TO USE

02:36:19.770 --> 02:36:22.272
SOME OF ANY GIVEN YEAR'S

02:36:22.339 --> 02:36:23.273
SURPLUS, WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY

02:36:23.340 --> 02:36:25.175
WILL CORRESPOND TO THOSE SAME

02:36:25.242 --> 02:36:27.611
YEARS WHEN PROP 98 IS TRIGGERED.

02:36:27.678 --> 02:36:30.547
BASED ON THE WAY COUNCIL HELPED

02:36:30.614 --> 02:36:32.683
US WRITE THIS, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU

02:36:32.750 --> 02:36:36.053
UNDERSTAND THAT AND IT HOPEFULLY

02:36:36.120 --> 02:36:37.821
I'M ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION, BUT

02:36:37.888 --> 02:36:41.658
IT THIS IS SURPLUS OVER THIS IS

02:36:41.725 --> 02:36:44.161
AFTER THE PROP 98 GUARANTEE HAS

02:36:44.228 --> 02:36:48.866
BEEN TAKEN. THE FORMULA HERE

02:36:48.932 --> 02:36:50.300
WOULD SET ASIDE OBVIOUSLY A

02:36:50.367 --> 02:36:52.169
LESSER AMOUNT. IF YOU LOOK AT

02:36:52.236 --> 02:36:55.472
THE ACTUAL FORMULA, PROBABLY IN

02:36:55.539 --> 02:36:57.508
A YEAR LIKE THE YEAR WE STARTED

02:36:57.574 --> 02:37:00.043
WITH THIS YEAR, WE TRIED TO KIND

02:37:00.110 --> 02:37:02.045
OF MODEL THINGS THAT WAY, WHERE

02:37:02.112 --> 02:37:03.614
WE ACTUALLY HAD A RESERVE

02:37:03.680 --> 02:37:05.749
ACCOUNT IN THE BASE BUDGET. THAT

02:37:05.816 --> 02:37:07.718
WAS A COUPLE OF BILLION DOLLARS.

02:37:07.785 --> 02:37:08.786
I'M SORRY, I DON'T REMEMBER THE

02:37:08.852 --> 02:37:10.587
EXACT FIGURE, BUT IT WAS IN THE

02:37:10.654 --> 02:37:12.990
LOW BILLIONS. AND THAT RESERVE

02:37:13.056 --> 02:37:15.192
ACCOUNT, OF COURSE, WAS WAS VERY

02:37:15.259 --> 02:37:16.560
DISCRETIONARY AND IT WENT AWAY

02:37:16.627 --> 02:37:19.630
ALREADY. THE IDEA HERE.

02:37:19.696 --> 02:37:20.864
ULTIMATELY THIS BILL WON'T DO IT

02:37:20.931 --> 02:37:23.167
BY ITSELF IS, IS TO HAVE THE

02:37:23.233 --> 02:37:24.501
COMPANION CONSTITUTIONAL

02:37:24.568 --> 02:37:27.805
AMENDMENT, WHICH ABSOLUTELY

02:37:27.871 --> 02:37:32.709
EXCLUDES ANY. ENCROACHMENT ON

02:37:32.776 --> 02:37:40.017
PROP 98. IT IT DOESN'T. HANDCUFF

02:37:40.083 --> 02:37:41.451
THE LEGISLATURE'S ABILITY IF

02:37:41.518 --> 02:37:44.721
THEY WANTED TO AT SOME POINT TO

02:37:44.788 --> 02:37:46.723
ROUTE THE MONEY IN A CERTAIN WAY

02:37:46.790 --> 02:37:47.825
THROUGH LCFF OR SOMETHING LIKE

02:37:47.891 --> 02:37:50.861
THAT, BUT IT ESTABLISHES A

02:37:50.928 --> 02:37:54.331
RESERVE ACCOUNT WITHOUT GETTING

02:37:54.398 --> 02:37:56.633
INTO TO THAT ISSUE PER SE, BOTH

02:37:56.700 --> 02:38:01.171
IN, IN IN THIS BILL AND THEN

02:38:01.238 --> 02:38:04.408
ULTIMATELY WITH THE SUCCESS OF A

02:38:04.474 --> 02:38:05.976
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT THAT

02:38:06.043 --> 02:38:07.878
SAYS THAT THAT RESERVE ACCOUNT

02:38:07.945 --> 02:38:09.213
CAN ONLY BE USED FOR

02:38:09.279 --> 02:38:12.015
EQUALIZATION PURPOSES. AND TRUE,

02:38:12.082 --> 02:38:14.251
WHERE THE BILL IS LANDED RIGHT

02:38:14.318 --> 02:38:18.455
NOW IS DEFINED BY EQUALIZATION

02:38:18.522 --> 02:38:19.923
BETWEEN NON BASIC AID AND BASIC

02:38:19.990 --> 02:38:21.959
AID SCHOOLS. AND THEN WE ONE OF

02:38:22.025 --> 02:38:23.627
MY COLLEAGUES BROUGHT UP A GREAT

02:38:23.694 --> 02:38:25.495
POINT IN SENATE EDUCATION THAT

02:38:25.562 --> 02:38:27.598
WE HAVE SOME WOBBLERS OUT THERE.

02:38:27.664 --> 02:38:30.167
AND SO WE PUT IN A PROVISION

02:38:30.234 --> 02:38:33.270
THAT WOULD SAY OVER A THREE YEAR

02:38:33.337 --> 02:38:36.206
PERIOD BY LOOKING AT THAT WINDOW

02:38:36.273 --> 02:38:38.108
AND MAKING THAT DETERMINATION, A

02:38:38.175 --> 02:38:40.110
SCHOOL COULD MOVE FROM BASIC AND

02:38:40.177 --> 02:38:41.478
NON-BASIC AID AND SUDDENLY BE

02:38:41.545 --> 02:38:42.813
ELIGIBLE FOR THIS MONEY. BUT WE

02:38:42.880 --> 02:38:44.381
TRIED TO LEAVE DISCRETION. AND

02:38:44.448 --> 02:38:46.950
OF COURSE, THIS IS A BILL. SO

02:38:47.017 --> 02:38:48.785
THERE'S SOMEONE CAN VOID IT AND

02:38:48.852 --> 02:38:50.821
START OVER AGAIN NEXT YEAR. BUT

02:38:50.888 --> 02:38:52.723
THE IDEA IS TO LEAVE THE

02:38:52.789 --> 02:38:54.091
LEGISLATURE AND THE BUDGET ACT

02:38:54.157 --> 02:38:58.362
SOME FLUIDITY IN TERMS OF, OF

02:38:58.428 --> 02:39:00.964
EXACTLY HOW TO, TO REACH

02:39:01.031 --> 02:39:03.467
EQUALIZATION. BUT AGAIN, OUR

02:39:03.533 --> 02:39:04.868
TARGET IS TRYING TO BRING THOSE

02:39:04.935 --> 02:39:06.670
NON BASIC AIDES UP BECAUSE

02:39:06.737 --> 02:39:08.605
THAT'S THAT'S THE MOST

02:39:08.672 --> 02:39:09.406
DEVASTATING GROWING DISPARITY

02:39:09.473 --> 02:39:11.041
RIGHT NOW. YEAH. THANK YOU FOR

02:39:11.108 --> 02:39:12.409
BRINGING UP THOSE WOBBLER SCHOOL

02:39:12.476 --> 02:39:14.077
DISTRICTS. WE HAVE ONE OF THOSE

02:39:14.144 --> 02:39:15.379
JUST OUTSIDE OF MY ASSEMBLY

02:39:15.445 --> 02:39:18.315
DISTRICT IN CARLSBAD. IT HAS YOU

02:39:18.382 --> 02:39:20.117
KNOW STRUGGLED AS SOMETIMES IN

02:39:20.183 --> 02:39:21.518
SOME YEARS THEY'RE ABLE TO

02:39:21.585 --> 02:39:22.619
TRANSFER IN STUDENTS. AND THEN

02:39:22.686 --> 02:39:24.588
IN SOME TIMES, SOME YEARS THEY

02:39:24.655 --> 02:39:25.455
HAVE TO DENY THOSE STUDENTS

02:39:25.522 --> 02:39:26.723
RETURNING BACK TO THOSE SCHOOL

02:39:26.790 --> 02:39:27.557
DISTRICTS BECAUSE THEY GO IN AND

02:39:27.624 --> 02:39:30.427
OUT OF BASIC AID AND CAN CAN'T

02:39:30.494 --> 02:39:33.063
AFFORD THOSE STUDENTS COMING IN.

02:39:33.130 --> 02:39:35.198
ANOTHER QUESTION, AND MAYBE THIS

02:39:35.265 --> 02:39:36.800
IS SOMETHING YOU'VE GIVEN SOME

02:39:36.867 --> 02:39:38.035
THOUGHT TO, BUT THERE ISN'T

02:39:38.101 --> 02:39:40.203
CONCRETE ANSWER AROUND. BUT

02:39:40.270 --> 02:39:43.774
AGAIN, CURIOSITY, WHO DO YOU

02:39:43.840 --> 02:39:45.609
PLAN TO HAVE MANAGE THESE FUNDS,

02:39:45.676 --> 02:39:47.644
AND ARE THERE GUARDRAILS AROUND

02:39:47.711 --> 02:39:49.980
THE INVESTMENTS THAT THESE FUNDS

02:39:50.047 --> 02:39:52.015
ARE PUT INTO? WELL, CLEARLY THE

02:39:52.082 --> 02:39:54.251
Ó IN ONCE THEY'RE ONCE THEY'RE

02:39:54.318 --> 02:39:58.155
PUSHED DOWNSTREAM, THE

02:39:58.221 --> 02:40:00.257
PRESUMPTION IS THAT THEY, YOU

02:40:00.324 --> 02:40:03.660
KNOW, THEY FOLLOW THE ORDINARY

02:40:03.727 --> 02:40:05.762
PATH OF GETTING TO BEING ADDED

02:40:05.829 --> 02:40:07.798
TO THE NON BASIC AID FUNDING

02:40:07.864 --> 02:40:12.669
STREAM. AND THEY ARRIVE AT NON

02:40:12.736 --> 02:40:13.770
BASIC AID SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND

02:40:13.837 --> 02:40:14.905
THEN THE SCHOOL BOARD ITSELF AT

02:40:14.972 --> 02:40:16.773
THAT POINT HAS GOT TO BALANCE

02:40:16.840 --> 02:40:18.842
ITS BUDGET WITH THE OVERSIGHT,

02:40:18.909 --> 02:40:19.810
YOU KNOW, OF THE COUNTY OFFICE

02:40:19.876 --> 02:40:21.244
AND THE ULTIMATELY THE STATE. SO

02:40:21.311 --> 02:40:23.380
WE HAVEN'T IN THIS BILL GOTTEN

02:40:23.447 --> 02:40:25.882
PRESCRIPTIVE ABOUT ANYTHING

02:40:25.949 --> 02:40:29.152
ELSE. I'M CERTAINLY OPEN TO I

02:40:29.219 --> 02:40:31.421
MEANT THE INVESTMENT ITSELF, THE

02:40:31.488 --> 02:40:33.924
INVESTMENT INSTRUMENT ITSELF, TO

02:40:33.991 --> 02:40:35.359
WHICH WILL GENERATE THE

02:40:35.425 --> 02:40:38.061
INTEREST. YEAH. THE INVESTMENT.

02:40:38.128 --> 02:40:39.363
WHAT WE BASICALLY INDICATED IN

02:40:39.429 --> 02:40:40.731
THE BILL IS JUST THAT THE

02:40:40.797 --> 02:40:42.199
INVESTMENT GOES INTO THE STATE

02:40:42.265 --> 02:40:44.267
INVESTMENT POOL, WHATEVER THE

02:40:44.334 --> 02:40:45.669
TREASURER, OUR UNDERSTANDING IS

02:40:45.736 --> 02:40:48.638
THE TREASURER MAKES THOSE

02:40:48.705 --> 02:40:50.107
DECISIONS, THE OFFICE OF THE

02:40:50.173 --> 02:40:53.343
TREASURER. SO UP TO THEM TO TRY

02:40:53.410 --> 02:40:54.544
TO MAXIMIZE RETURN ON INVESTMENT

02:40:54.611 --> 02:40:56.847
ON THOSE DOLLARS. WE HOPE IT

02:40:56.913 --> 02:40:59.116
WOULD BE A LOT. THE PRINCIPAL

02:40:59.182 --> 02:41:00.851
DOESN'T GET TOUCHED IN THIS BILL

02:41:00.917 --> 02:41:01.918
SO THAT THERE WOULDN'T BE A

02:41:01.985 --> 02:41:04.855
ROLLER COASTER RIDE. IT WOULD.

02:41:04.921 --> 02:41:07.457
THE IDEA IS TO IS TO THROW OFF

02:41:07.524 --> 02:41:08.825
INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS, ALMOST

02:41:08.892 --> 02:41:11.395
LIKE A CALPERS TYPE OF RETURN ON

02:41:11.461 --> 02:41:12.529
INVESTMENT. AND THAT'S WHAT ENDS

02:41:12.596 --> 02:41:15.866
UP GETTING PUSHED OUT. SO IT

02:41:15.932 --> 02:41:17.167
WILL TAKE TIME. THAT'S WHY I

02:41:17.234 --> 02:41:18.635
SAID EARLIER, AND I APPRECIATE

02:41:18.702 --> 02:41:21.471
YOU UNDERSTANDING, I GUESS FOR

02:41:21.538 --> 02:41:23.974
EVERYONE'S BENEFIT, WE AREN'T

02:41:24.041 --> 02:41:25.842
GOING TO FILL UP THE ENDOWMENT

02:41:25.909 --> 02:41:28.211
FUND OVERNIGHT AND SOLVE THIS

02:41:28.278 --> 02:41:29.413
PROBLEM OR CLOSE THE ULTIMATE

02:41:29.479 --> 02:41:31.048
GAP OVERNIGHT. BUT IT TOOK US 46

02:41:31.114 --> 02:41:33.016
YEARS TO GET HERE. I MEAN, EVER

02:41:33.083 --> 02:41:35.052
SINCE PROP 13 PASSED, WE'VE HAD

02:41:35.118 --> 02:41:37.154
THIS DISPARATE FUNDING FORMULA

02:41:37.220 --> 02:41:39.056
OF BASIC AID AND ON BASIC AID.

02:41:39.122 --> 02:41:41.958
THAT'S JUST IT GROWS. AND THE

02:41:42.025 --> 02:41:43.593
IRONY OF IT ALL IS, IS THAT EVEN

02:41:43.660 --> 02:41:47.030
WHEN THE PROP 98 GUARANTEE IS

02:41:47.097 --> 02:41:49.900
TRIGGERED AND GOES UP, IT GREAT.

02:41:49.966 --> 02:41:51.568
IT'S PUSHING MORE MONEY OUT TO

02:41:51.635 --> 02:41:53.270
EDUCATION, BUT IT'S ACTUALLY

02:41:53.336 --> 02:41:54.171
GROWING THE DISPARITY EVEN MORE

02:41:54.237 --> 02:41:55.906
BECAUSE OF THE DISPARATE FUNDING

02:41:55.972 --> 02:41:57.774
FORMULA. SO SOMETHING HAS TO BE

02:41:57.841 --> 02:42:00.911
DONE SOON. AND FRANKLY, IT MAY

02:42:00.977 --> 02:42:03.046
TAKE HOPEFULLY NOT AS MANY

02:42:03.113 --> 02:42:04.714
DECADES BUT DECADES TO

02:42:04.781 --> 02:42:05.882
EVENTUALLY CLOSE THE GAP. THAT'S

02:42:05.949 --> 02:42:08.885
THE IDEA. YEAH. AND I HAVE TO

02:42:08.952 --> 02:42:10.720
AGREE WITH SOME OF YOUR

02:42:10.787 --> 02:42:13.256
OPPOSITION HERE ON THE BILL THAT

02:42:13.323 --> 02:42:15.492
I DO WISH THAT WE COULD HAVE

02:42:15.559 --> 02:42:17.194
THIS COME OUT OF DIRECTLY

02:42:17.260 --> 02:42:18.995
INCREASING PROP 98. THAT WOULD

02:42:19.062 --> 02:42:21.798
BE THE IDEAL WAY TO DO IT, AND

02:42:21.865 --> 02:42:22.933
TO INCREASE BASE FUNDING AND

02:42:22.999 --> 02:42:23.934
MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S AN

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:25.469
EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF THOSE

02:42:25.535 --> 02:42:28.238
FUNDS. I WOULD CERTAINLY PREFER

02:42:28.305 --> 02:42:32.309
IT TO COME THAT WAY, BUT THIS

02:42:32.375 --> 02:42:35.879
IDEA STILL INTRIGUES ME, AND I'M

02:42:35.946 --> 02:42:37.380
INTERESTED IN SEEING IT COME OUT

02:42:37.447 --> 02:42:39.516
AND SEE WHERE YOU TAKE IT FROM

02:42:39.583 --> 02:42:41.184
HERE. I THINK THERE'S STILL SOME

02:42:41.251 --> 02:42:44.588
WORK TO DO ON IT, AND I HOPE

02:42:44.654 --> 02:42:46.690
THAT WE GET TO A POINT THAT IT'S

02:42:46.756 --> 02:42:49.493
OKAY TO TRY BOTH STRATEGIES. WE

02:42:49.559 --> 02:42:51.595
DON'T WE DON'T HAVE TO CHOOSE

02:42:51.661 --> 02:42:53.163
ONE OR THE OTHER, BUT WE CAN

02:42:53.230 --> 02:42:54.998
CONTINUE TO LOOK AT BOTH AS A

02:42:55.065 --> 02:42:56.032
MULTI-PRONGED APPROACH TO

02:42:56.099 --> 02:42:58.268
ENSURING THAT OUR CALIFORNIA

02:42:58.335 --> 02:43:00.103
CHILDREN GET THE EDUCATION THAT

02:43:00.170 --> 02:43:02.639
THEY DESERVE. THANK YOU. AND IF

02:43:02.706 --> 02:43:04.274
I MAY, JUST THROUGH THE CHAIR,

02:43:04.341 --> 02:43:05.408
AND I KNOW AGAIN, PROBABLY

02:43:05.475 --> 02:43:06.543
EVERYONE ON THIS COMMITTEE

02:43:06.610 --> 02:43:09.246
UNDERSTANDS THIS. I THINK THE

02:43:09.312 --> 02:43:12.282
TENSION AROUND PROP 98, EVEN

02:43:12.349 --> 02:43:15.252
THOUGH TWO TWO ISSUES, WE CAN

02:43:15.318 --> 02:43:17.954
INCREASE IT BEYOND THE FOUR IN A

02:43:18.021 --> 02:43:20.924
TRIGGERED YEAR. AND THEN THAT

02:43:20.991 --> 02:43:23.493
FUNDING AGAIN GOES OUT BASED ON

02:43:23.560 --> 02:43:26.296
CURRENT FORMULAS. SO IRONICALLY,

02:43:26.363 --> 02:43:27.764
EVERYBODY GETS MORE MONEY, BUT

02:43:27.831 --> 02:43:31.735
IT INCREASES THE DISPARITY. BUT

02:43:31.801 --> 02:43:33.470
THERE'S ALSO BEEN A RELUCTANCE

02:43:33.537 --> 02:43:35.605
TO ADD ON BY THE LEGISLATURE,

02:43:35.672 --> 02:43:37.474
KNOWING THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY

02:43:37.541 --> 02:43:38.875
INCREASING THE FLOOR IN AN

02:43:38.942 --> 02:43:40.744
IRREVERSIBLE WAY. IT'S NOT NOT

02:43:40.810 --> 02:43:43.914
TO SAY THAT CAN'T BE DONE AS WE

02:43:43.980 --> 02:43:45.782
ALL KNOW. SO AS WE TRIED TO

02:43:45.849 --> 02:43:48.185
BUILD THIS GOING BACK MONTHS AND

02:43:48.251 --> 02:43:50.086
MONTHS AND MONTHS AGO AND, AND,

02:43:50.153 --> 02:43:51.555
YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY WORK VERY

02:43:51.621 --> 02:43:53.657
CLOSELY WITH EXPERTS LEDGE

02:43:53.723 --> 02:43:55.525
COUNCIL THAT CAN UNDERSTAND THE

02:43:55.592 --> 02:43:56.860
MECHANISMS AND HAVE WRITTEN SOME

02:43:56.927 --> 02:43:59.462
OF THEM IN THE PAST. THE THOUGHT

02:43:59.529 --> 02:44:03.066
WAS, WE DON'T WANT TO STRIKE

02:44:03.133 --> 02:44:04.768
FEAR INTO INTO THE HEARTS OF

02:44:04.834 --> 02:44:06.703
ANYONE THAT WE'RE REOPENING WITH

02:44:06.770 --> 02:44:08.438
A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT, PROP

02:44:08.505 --> 02:44:10.740
98, WHICH IS FOR A LOT OF FOLKS

02:44:10.807 --> 02:44:13.043
AND A LOT OF STAKEHOLDERS IN THE

02:44:13.109 --> 02:44:13.810
EDUCATION COMMUNITY, HAS WORKED

02:44:13.877 --> 02:44:15.679
WELL ENOUGH THAT THEY WOULDN'T

02:44:15.745 --> 02:44:17.514
WANT TO SEE THAT TINKERED WITH.

02:44:17.581 --> 02:44:18.548
AND WE CERTAINLY AREN'T GOING TO

02:44:18.615 --> 02:44:20.684
GET AWAY WITH OPENING UP PROP 13

02:44:20.750 --> 02:44:22.786
AND CHANGING THE ORIGINAL 1979

02:44:22.852 --> 02:44:23.987
FORMULA AROUND, BECAUSE THAT

02:44:24.054 --> 02:44:25.722
STRIKES FEAR INTO THE HEARTS OF

02:44:25.789 --> 02:44:27.424
VOTERS EVERYWHERE, IT SEEMS. AND

02:44:27.490 --> 02:44:30.994
SO IT SEEMED LIKE ALMOST BY

02:44:31.061 --> 02:44:32.462
PROCESS OF ELIMINATION, YOU GOT

02:44:32.529 --> 02:44:34.164
TO THE POINT. WE GOT TO THE

02:44:34.231 --> 02:44:36.533
POINT WHERE THE BEST WAY TO GO

02:44:36.600 --> 02:44:38.101
ABOUT IT IS TO IS TO ISOLATE

02:44:38.168 --> 02:44:40.036
THIS PROBLEM AND CREATE ITS OWN

02:44:40.103 --> 02:44:41.938
ALMOST PROP 98 JUNIOR, IF YOU

02:44:42.005 --> 02:44:44.140
WILL. BUT BUT FOR THESE

02:44:44.207 --> 02:44:45.909
NON-BASIC AID SCHOOLS AND JUST

02:44:45.976 --> 02:44:47.577
ISOLATE THE PROBLEM WITHOUT

02:44:47.644 --> 02:44:49.879
TOUCHING OR INTERFERING WITH

02:44:49.946 --> 02:44:52.716
SOME OF THE SACRED COWS AND FOR

02:44:52.782 --> 02:44:54.017
GOOD REASON, SOME OF THEM ARE

02:44:54.084 --> 02:44:55.986
SACRED COWS, LET'S FACE IT. SO

02:44:56.052 --> 02:44:58.154
THAT'S I JUST WANTED TO EXPLAIN

02:44:58.221 --> 02:45:00.624
HOW THE INSPIRATION ALSO HAD

02:45:00.690 --> 02:45:04.961
SOME. YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW, GUT

02:45:05.028 --> 02:45:06.863
CHECKS ALONG THE WAY AS TO WHAT

02:45:06.930 --> 02:45:09.366
COULD YOU ACTUALLY PULL OFF AND

02:45:09.432 --> 02:45:12.869
GET TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK?

02:45:12.936 --> 02:45:16.139
THANK YOU. THANK YOU, MR.

02:45:16.206 --> 02:45:17.540
ALVAREZ. THANK YOU. I'LL BE

02:45:17.607 --> 02:45:18.908
BRIEF. THANK YOU. SENATOR. I

02:45:18.975 --> 02:45:20.910
ALSO I'D LIKE TO USE THE WORD BY

02:45:20.977 --> 02:45:22.112
MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO,

02:45:22.178 --> 02:45:24.514
VERY INTRIGUED BY THIS. I THINK,

02:45:24.581 --> 02:45:27.651
AS CHAIR OF THE EDUCATION

02:45:27.717 --> 02:45:29.753
FINANCE COMMITTEE, OBVIOUSLY

02:45:29.819 --> 02:45:32.289
LOOKING ALWAYS FOR WAYS TO TRY

02:45:32.355 --> 02:45:34.424
AND NOT ONLY PROTECT, BUT DO AS

02:45:34.491 --> 02:45:36.326
BEST AS WE CAN FOR PUBLIC

02:45:36.393 --> 02:45:38.028
EDUCATION. SO I THINK THIS IS,

02:45:38.094 --> 02:45:41.731
YOU ANOTHER POTENTIAL TOOL THAT

02:45:41.798 --> 02:45:43.099
COULD BE ADDED ESSENTIALLY, IS

02:45:43.166 --> 02:45:44.634
WHAT THIS WOULD BE TO ENSURE

02:45:44.701 --> 02:45:46.136
THAT WE CREATE THE STABILITY

02:45:46.202 --> 02:45:48.104
THAT OUR SCHOOL SYSTEMS NEED IN

02:45:48.171 --> 02:45:50.373
ORDER TO FUNCTION EFFECTIVELY

02:45:50.440 --> 02:45:52.375
AND NOT THESE POTENTIAL,

02:45:52.442 --> 02:45:53.910
ESPECIALLY THESE YEARS WHERE

02:45:53.977 --> 02:45:56.513
THERE'S SWINGS ONE WAY AND THE

02:45:56.579 --> 02:45:59.082
OTHER IN TERMS OF REVENUE AND 98

02:45:59.149 --> 02:46:01.451
GUARANTEE. SO I DON'T HAVE ANY

02:46:01.518 --> 02:46:02.786
QUESTIONS. I JUST I WOULD LIKE

02:46:02.852 --> 02:46:06.556
TO. TO KEEP THE CONVERSATION

02:46:06.623 --> 02:46:07.957
GOING. I'M HOPEFUL THAT THIS

02:46:08.024 --> 02:46:09.726
GOES FORWARD. IF FOR SOME

02:46:09.793 --> 02:46:10.760
REASON, YOU KNOW, YOU GET

02:46:10.827 --> 02:46:12.529
STALLED ALONG THE WAY. I'D LIKE

02:46:12.595 --> 02:46:14.197
TO ENGAGE WITH YOU IN THIS

02:46:14.264 --> 02:46:15.899
CONVERSATION NEXT YEAR THROUGH

02:46:15.965 --> 02:46:17.400
THROUGH OUR BUDGETARY PROCESS,

02:46:17.467 --> 02:46:18.802
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A VERY

02:46:18.868 --> 02:46:20.570
INTERESTING IDEA. WE'VE TRIED

02:46:20.637 --> 02:46:22.038
THIS YEAR, AND IN THE LAST TWO

02:46:22.105 --> 02:46:24.140
YEARS SINCE I'VE CHAIRED THE

02:46:24.207 --> 02:46:25.008
COMMITTEE, TO REALLY TRY TO

02:46:25.075 --> 02:46:27.010
BUILD A RESILIENCE EDUCATION

02:46:27.077 --> 02:46:28.912
BUDGET FOR THE COURSE OF TIME.

02:46:28.978 --> 02:46:30.647
AND I THINK THAT'S THE WAY I SEE

02:46:30.714 --> 02:46:32.315
YOUR APPROACH, WHICH IS WHY I'M

02:46:32.382 --> 02:46:34.117
SO APPRECIATIVE. I WOULD ALSO

02:46:34.184 --> 02:46:35.652
SAY FOR ESPECIALLY THE

02:46:35.719 --> 02:46:38.455
OPPOSITION, ON BOTH THE ADEQUACY

02:46:38.521 --> 02:46:43.593
OF, OF FUNDING FOR LCFF, WE HAVE

02:46:43.660 --> 02:46:46.463
A BILL, SB OR AB, EXCUSE ME,

02:46:46.529 --> 02:46:47.964
1204 WHICH IS WORKING THROUGH

02:46:48.031 --> 02:46:49.766
THE PROCESS NOW, WHICH TALKS

02:46:49.833 --> 02:46:51.634
ABOUT THAT. AND I THINK THAT IS

02:46:51.701 --> 02:46:52.602
A CONVERSATION THAT I DON'T

02:46:52.669 --> 02:46:54.437
THINK THE AUTHOR DISAGREES.

02:46:54.504 --> 02:46:55.805
CERTAINLY NONE OF US DISAGREE.

02:46:55.872 --> 02:46:57.707
THAT IS WORTHWHILE, AND I THINK

02:46:57.774 --> 02:46:59.409
WE SHOULD HAVE THAT. BUT ANOTHER

02:46:59.476 --> 02:47:03.413
TOOL IN IN THE TOOLBOX TO

02:47:03.480 --> 02:47:05.849
POTENTIALLY HELP WITH EDUCATION

02:47:05.915 --> 02:47:08.518
FUNDING IS WELCOME. AND I THANK

02:47:08.585 --> 02:47:10.587
YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS AND

02:47:10.653 --> 02:47:12.155
BRINGING IT FORWARD. THANK YOU

02:47:12.222 --> 02:47:13.022
VERY MUCH. THROUGH THE CHAIR.

02:47:13.089 --> 02:47:14.491
JUST RESPOND VERY BRIEFLY. FIRST

02:47:14.557 --> 02:47:17.861
OF ALL, THANK YOU FOR YOUR

02:47:17.927 --> 02:47:21.631
COMMENTS. AGAIN, I THINK THERE'S

02:47:21.698 --> 02:47:23.800
A PRACTICAL DECISION NOT TO TRY

02:47:23.867 --> 02:47:27.370
TO DO TWO BIG THINGS IN ONE BILL

02:47:27.437 --> 02:47:32.308
ATTACK. LCFF FLAWS THAT THAT

02:47:32.375 --> 02:47:34.811
MAYBE MANY OF US RECOGNIZE. AND

02:47:34.878 --> 02:47:38.148
THEN AND ALSO ATTACK THIS NARROW

02:47:38.214 --> 02:47:39.416
ISSUE, IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT

02:47:39.482 --> 02:47:43.019
THAT. I JUST THE SECOND POINT I

02:47:43.086 --> 02:47:44.454
WANTED TO MAKE IS THE

02:47:44.521 --> 02:47:45.522
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT THAT

02:47:45.588 --> 02:47:48.858
OUR N IS READY TO CROSS, BUT

02:47:48.925 --> 02:47:54.564
BECAUSE OF. HOW CAN I SAY THIS

02:47:54.631 --> 02:47:55.665
APPROPRIATELY BECAUSE OF

02:47:55.732 --> 02:47:57.700
DECISIONS IN THE SENATE ABOUT

02:47:57.767 --> 02:47:59.068
WHAT WE'D BE MOVING THIS YEAR.

02:47:59.135 --> 02:48:00.837
THAT'S A JANUARY BILL. BUT IT

02:48:00.904 --> 02:48:04.174
MADE SENSE FOR US TO DEMONSTRATE

02:48:04.240 --> 02:48:05.708
THAT YOU CAN CREATE A FRAMEWORK

02:48:05.775 --> 02:48:06.709
BEFORE GOING TO PEOPLE AND

02:48:06.776 --> 02:48:08.578
SAYING, LET'S DO A

02:48:08.645 --> 02:48:09.179
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT, YOU

02:48:09.245 --> 02:48:10.480
KNOW, TO EQUALIZE BASIC AND

02:48:10.547 --> 02:48:11.448
NONBASIC SCHOOLS. I SUPPOSE THE

02:48:11.514 --> 02:48:13.883
QUESTION IS, IF I WAS HERE WITH

02:48:13.950 --> 02:48:15.051
ONLY THAT BILL, PEOPLE WOULD BE

02:48:15.118 --> 02:48:16.419
SAYING, WELL, WHAT THE HECK IS

02:48:16.486 --> 02:48:17.854
THAT GOING TO LOOK LIKE? AND HOW

02:48:17.921 --> 02:48:20.423
DO YOU DO IT? AND DO YOU HAVE A

02:48:20.490 --> 02:48:21.758
RESERVE ACCOUNT AND WHAT DO YOU

02:48:21.825 --> 02:48:23.426
DO? SO WE WANTED TO GET THIS

02:48:23.493 --> 02:48:25.295
FRAMEWORK, WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY

02:48:25.361 --> 02:48:25.895
CHANGEABLE BY THE LEGISLATURE

02:48:25.962 --> 02:48:27.197
BECAUSE IT'S A BILL. BUT I

02:48:27.263 --> 02:48:29.866
REALLY RESPONDING TO YOUR OFFER

02:48:29.933 --> 02:48:31.601
OF COLLABORATION IS THE WAY I

02:48:31.668 --> 02:48:33.203
HEARD IT, HER INVITATION TO

02:48:33.269 --> 02:48:34.771
COLLABORATE, BECAUSE I THINK ON

02:48:34.838 --> 02:48:35.905
THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT,

02:48:35.972 --> 02:48:37.307
OUR END, WE'RE GOING TO REALLY

02:48:37.373 --> 02:48:39.209
NEED THAT HELP TO MAKE SURE WE

02:48:39.275 --> 02:48:41.411
DON'T. OBVIOUSLY, THE TRICK

02:48:41.478 --> 02:48:43.112
THERE IS NOT TO GO TOO FAR, BUT

02:48:43.179 --> 02:48:44.647
TO BE CONCISE ENOUGH TO GET INTO

02:48:44.714 --> 02:48:47.383
THE CONSTITUTION AND MAKE SURE

02:48:47.450 --> 02:48:48.852
WE BUTTONED. WE'VE BUTTONED UP

02:48:48.918 --> 02:48:50.720
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AT THE

02:48:50.787 --> 02:48:52.922
SAME TIME. SO WE'RE GOING TO

02:48:52.989 --> 02:48:53.756
NEED HELP WITH THAT. AND I THINK

02:48:53.823 --> 02:48:55.692
THAT'S A WHOLE NOTHER YEAR OF

02:48:55.758 --> 02:48:56.392
DISCUSSION THAT WILL KEEP

02:48:56.459 --> 02:48:58.094
DRAGGING IF THIS, YOU KNOW, THE

02:48:58.161 --> 02:49:00.430
ELEMENTS OF THIS BILL ALONG INTO

02:49:00.497 --> 02:49:04.367
NEXT YEAR, IF I CAN PUT IT THAT

02:49:04.434 --> 02:49:06.236
WAY. SO WE'D LOVE TO HAVE THE

02:49:06.302 --> 02:49:07.604
ASSISTANCE OF THIS COMMITTEE OF

02:49:07.670 --> 02:49:09.138
YOUR COMMITTEE OF OBVIOUSLY

02:49:09.205 --> 02:49:11.975
FOLKS ON THE SENATE SIDE.

02:49:12.041 --> 02:49:13.176
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF EYES ON

02:49:13.243 --> 02:49:17.680
THIS, BUT WE CAN USE MORE. THANK

02:49:17.747 --> 02:49:20.149
YOU. SEEING NO FURTHER QUESTIONS

02:49:20.216 --> 02:49:21.985
OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE.

02:49:22.051 --> 02:49:23.453
WELL, THAT'S CERTAINLY CAUGHT MY

02:49:23.520 --> 02:49:26.556
ATTENTION AS A ANOTHER EDUCATION

02:49:26.623 --> 02:49:30.260
FINANCE GEEK. YOU KNOW, I JUST

02:49:30.326 --> 02:49:31.594
NOTICED IN THE COMMITTEE

02:49:31.661 --> 02:49:33.596
ANALYSIS RELATED LEGISLATION,

02:49:33.663 --> 02:49:34.898
THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF

02:49:34.964 --> 02:49:37.734
MURATSUCHI BILLS THAT THAT I HAD

02:49:37.800 --> 02:49:39.335
PROPOSED IN THE PAST, LARGELY

02:49:39.402 --> 02:49:40.770
ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT THE

02:49:40.837 --> 02:49:43.339
SCHOOL BOARD ASSOCIATION TALKED

02:49:43.406 --> 02:49:45.375
ABOUT, WHICH IS, YOU KNOW,

02:49:45.441 --> 02:49:46.776
TRYING TO SET ASPIRATIONAL

02:49:46.843 --> 02:49:48.645
FUNDING TARGETS TO INCREASE THE

02:49:48.711 --> 02:49:50.446
BASE GRANT, YOU KNOW, TO WORK IT

02:49:50.513 --> 02:49:52.515
THROUGH PROPOSITION 98. BUT I'M

02:49:52.582 --> 02:49:54.117
ALSO COMING AT THIS, YOU KNOW,

02:49:54.183 --> 02:49:56.319
AS A FORMER NON-BASIC AID SCHOOL

02:49:56.386 --> 02:49:58.688
BOARD MEMBER, YOU KNOW, I HEAR I

02:49:58.755 --> 02:50:00.557
FEEL YOUR PAIN BECAUSE, YOU

02:50:00.623 --> 02:50:01.991
KNOW, WE'RE ALWAYS COMPETING,

02:50:02.058 --> 02:50:03.560
TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH THE

02:50:03.626 --> 02:50:07.230
SALARY SCHEDULES OF THE BASIC

02:50:07.297 --> 02:50:08.965
AID SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND JUST

02:50:09.032 --> 02:50:12.001
GOING BACK TO, YOU KNOW, THE

02:50:12.068 --> 02:50:14.571
BASIC PRINCIPLE THAT STARTED

02:50:14.637 --> 02:50:16.306
WITH SERRANO VERSUS PRIEST. YOU

02:50:16.372 --> 02:50:17.674
KNOW, I MEAN, THAT SCHOOL

02:50:17.740 --> 02:50:19.309
FUNDING IS NOT SUPPOSED TO

02:50:19.375 --> 02:50:21.945
DEPEND ON WHERE YOU LIVE. AND SO

02:50:22.011 --> 02:50:23.813
I WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MR.

02:50:23.880 --> 02:50:26.783
CAPON BEING HERE. I DON'T WANT

02:50:26.849 --> 02:50:28.818
TO MAKE YOUR YOUR YOUR TRIP MAKE

02:50:28.885 --> 02:50:31.087
YOUR TRIP WORTHWHILE. BUT YOU

02:50:31.154 --> 02:50:35.291
KNOW. WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE

02:50:35.358 --> 02:50:38.027
CURRENT BASIC AID SYSTEM IN

02:50:38.094 --> 02:50:39.529
VIOLATION OF SERRANO VERSUS

02:50:39.596 --> 02:50:42.899
PRIEST? RIGHT. I WAS GOING TO

02:50:42.966 --> 02:50:45.268
START BY SAYING THANK YOU, MR.

02:50:45.335 --> 02:50:47.070
CHAIR, BUT I'M NOT SURE I CAN

02:50:47.136 --> 02:50:48.371
SAY THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION.

02:50:48.438 --> 02:50:49.005
KEN CAPON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE

02:50:49.072 --> 02:50:51.007
ANALYST'S OFFICE TOOK OVER

02:50:51.074 --> 02:50:51.975
PROPOSITION 98 FOR THE OFFICE.

02:50:52.041 --> 02:50:53.843
THE ISSUE OF BASIC AID DISTRICTS

02:50:53.910 --> 02:50:54.944
WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS NEVER

02:50:55.011 --> 02:50:57.013
REALLY ADDRESSED DIRECTLY IN THE

02:50:57.080 --> 02:50:58.815
ORIGINAL SERRANO VERSUS PRIEST

02:50:58.881 --> 02:51:00.950
LEGISLATION LAWSUIT. THE COURT

02:51:01.017 --> 02:51:02.418
IN THAT CASE SEEMED VERY

02:51:02.485 --> 02:51:03.486
CONCERNED ABOUT DISTRICTS THAT

02:51:03.553 --> 02:51:05.221
WERE AT THE BOTTOM END OF THE

02:51:05.288 --> 02:51:06.422
SPECTRUM, AND IT ORDERED THE

02:51:06.489 --> 02:51:08.791
LEGISLATURE TO ELIMINATE A LOT

02:51:08.858 --> 02:51:10.627
OF THE DISPARITIES THAT WERE

02:51:10.693 --> 02:51:12.161
ATTRIBUTABLE TO DIFFERENCES IN

02:51:12.228 --> 02:51:13.496
PROPERTY TAX WEALTH. AND THE

02:51:13.563 --> 02:51:15.031
LEGISLATURE CAME UP WITH A

02:51:15.098 --> 02:51:17.600
SYSTEM THAT DID THAT. OVER TIME,

02:51:17.667 --> 02:51:19.068
IT MADE FURTHER PROGRESS AND

02:51:19.135 --> 02:51:20.236
ELIMINATE A LOT OF THE

02:51:20.303 --> 02:51:22.005
HISTORICAL DISPARITIES. BUT THE

02:51:22.071 --> 02:51:24.107
ISSUE OF DISTRICTS AT THE OTHER

02:51:24.173 --> 02:51:24.741
END OF THE SPECTRUM, AT THE TOP

02:51:24.807 --> 02:51:26.776
WASN'T SOMETHING THAT THE COURT

02:51:26.843 --> 02:51:28.745
EVER, EVER ADDRESSED, BUT IT IS

02:51:28.811 --> 02:51:30.813
AN ISSUE, I THINK THAT DOES SEEM

02:51:30.880 --> 02:51:33.049
TO US MAYBE. WELL, IT DOES SEEM

02:51:33.116 --> 02:51:34.917
INCONSISTENT WITH SOME OF THE

02:51:34.984 --> 02:51:36.686
PRINCIPLES OF THE LCFF AND THE

02:51:36.753 --> 02:51:37.286
IDEA OF EQUALIZATION AND NOT

02:51:37.353 --> 02:51:38.888
HAVING THESE DISPARITIES BASED

02:51:38.955 --> 02:51:40.189
ON HISTORICAL FACTORS AND

02:51:40.256 --> 02:51:43.059
PROPERTY TAX ALLOCATIONS, AS WAS

02:51:43.126 --> 02:51:45.128
BROUGHT UP BY THE AUTHOR AND

02:51:45.194 --> 02:51:45.795
SOME OF THE MEMBERS. YOU DO HAVE

02:51:45.862 --> 02:51:47.730
A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS OR

02:51:47.797 --> 02:51:49.365
STRATEGIES FOR CLOSING THOSE

02:51:49.432 --> 02:51:51.067
GAPS. YOUR BILL IS ONE THAT

02:51:51.134 --> 02:51:52.435
WOULD INCREASE THE TARGETS. THIS

02:51:52.502 --> 02:51:54.437
IS ANOTHER OPTION. WE'VE HAD

02:51:54.504 --> 02:51:56.372
SOME RECOMMENDATIONS, OTHER

02:51:56.439 --> 02:51:58.307
OPTIONS OVER TIME, AND NONE OF

02:51:58.374 --> 02:51:59.342
THESE OPTIONS ARE REALLY

02:51:59.409 --> 02:52:00.977
MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. SO YOU CAN

02:52:01.044 --> 02:52:02.245
DO DIFFERENT STRATEGIES, PERHAPS

02:52:02.311 --> 02:52:04.347
MORE THAN ONE AT THE SAME TIME.

02:52:04.414 --> 02:52:07.617
BUT IT IS. I THINK IT'S A

02:52:07.684 --> 02:52:08.985
WORTHWHILE I THINK WE WOULD SAY

02:52:09.052 --> 02:52:10.520
IT'S A WORTHWHILE EFFORT,

02:52:10.586 --> 02:52:11.487
ALTHOUGH WE DON'T HAVE A

02:52:11.554 --> 02:52:12.855
SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATION ON THE

02:52:12.922 --> 02:52:14.457
SPECIFIC STRATEGY THAT YOU

02:52:14.524 --> 02:52:16.659
ADOPT. ALL RIGHT. YOU WEASELED

02:52:16.726 --> 02:52:20.263
YOUR WAY OUT OF THAT ONE. YEAH.

02:52:20.329 --> 02:52:24.067
YEAH, I SO I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT

02:52:24.133 --> 02:52:26.736
YOUR YOUR BILL, SENATOR CORTESE

02:52:26.803 --> 02:52:31.074
I YOU KNOW, ALTHOUGH. YEAH, I

02:52:31.140 --> 02:52:33.743
WAS ACTUALLY SURPRISED. I GOTTA

02:52:33.810 --> 02:52:35.511
HOPE THEY DON'T MIND MY CALLING

02:52:35.578 --> 02:52:37.480
THEM OUT. BUT, YOU KNOW, USUALLY

02:52:37.547 --> 02:52:38.648
WHEN YOU'RE MESSING WITH

02:52:38.715 --> 02:52:40.416
PROPOSITION 98, WE HEAR FROM THE

02:52:40.483 --> 02:52:41.084
CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION.

02:52:41.150 --> 02:52:43.352
AND, YOU KNOW, I'M SURPRISED

02:52:43.419 --> 02:52:44.787
THAT THEY HAVEN'T WEIGHED IN ON

02:52:44.854 --> 02:52:47.890
THIS. BUT ANYWAY, I AM ALWAYS

02:52:47.957 --> 02:52:48.891
LOOKING FOR WAYS TO GET MORE.

02:52:48.958 --> 02:52:50.560
BOTTOM LINE, I'M ALWAYS LOOKING

02:52:50.626 --> 02:52:53.262
FOR WAYS TO ONE GET MORE FUNDING

02:52:53.329 --> 02:52:55.832
IN OUR CLASSROOMS AND TWO, TO

02:52:55.898 --> 02:52:57.633
CLOSE THE FUNDING INEQUITIES

02:52:57.700 --> 02:52:59.869
THAT WE FACE TODAY. AND I THINK

02:52:59.936 --> 02:53:01.537
YOUR YOUR BILL CHECKS BOTH OF

02:53:01.604 --> 02:53:03.973
THOSE BOXES. I'D LIKE TO GIVE

02:53:04.040 --> 02:53:05.742
YOU THE LAST WORD. THANK YOU

02:53:05.808 --> 02:53:07.744

OF THIS COMMITTEE IS EVIDENT IN

02:53:09.679 --> 02:53:10.813
THE COMMENTS AND THE DISCUSSION.

02:53:10.880 --> 02:53:13.216
I APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH. AND I

02:53:13.282 --> 02:53:15.752
WOULD JUST SAY NOT TO HAVE THE

02:53:15.818 --> 02:53:18.254
LAST WORD ON, YOU KNOW, WHO'S

02:53:18.321 --> 02:53:19.722
NOT IN OPPOSITION. BUT WE'VE,

02:53:19.789 --> 02:53:21.724
YOU KNOW, SPENT A LOT OF TIME,

02:53:21.791 --> 02:53:25.061
AS HAVE FOLKS LIKE K¾T LOOKING

02:53:25.128 --> 02:53:27.130
AT THE BILL, YOU KNOW, LINE BY

02:53:27.196 --> 02:53:29.098
LINE, WORD BY WORD TO MAKE SURE

02:53:29.165 --> 02:53:30.333
IT DOESN'T INTERFERE WITH PROP

02:53:30.399 --> 02:53:33.369
98, THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN. AND AS

02:53:33.436 --> 02:53:36.806
YOU CAN IMAGINE, BUT I'LL

02:53:36.873 --> 02:53:38.341
RECONFIRM IT. THAT WAS ONE OF

02:53:38.407 --> 02:53:39.976
THE INITIAL MARCHING ORDERS FOR

02:53:40.042 --> 02:53:42.245
LEEDS COUNCIL BEFORE FIRST DRAFT

02:53:42.311 --> 02:53:43.880
WN AS YOU NEED TO WRITE THIS IN

02:53:43.946 --> 02:53:46.115
A WAY THAT COMPLETELY PROTECTS

02:53:46.182 --> 02:53:47.984
OR COMPLETELY SEGREGATED FROM

02:53:48.050 --> 02:53:50.920
PROP 98. SO I DON'T EXPECT

02:53:50.987 --> 02:53:51.921
EVERYONE ON EVERY COMMITTEE TO

02:53:51.988 --> 02:53:53.456
TAKE THAT DEEP DIVE. BUT I

02:53:53.523 --> 02:53:55.324
WANTED TO ASSURE AND REASSURE

02:53:55.391 --> 02:53:56.859
THAT THAT'S THAT'S BEEN DONE.

02:53:56.926 --> 02:53:58.528
AND IF ANYTHING MORE NEEDS TO BE

02:53:58.594 --> 02:53:59.562
DONE IN THAT REGARD, I'M HAPPY

02:53:59.629 --> 02:54:04.534
TO DO IT. WE DO HAVE TEACHERS IN

02:54:04.600 --> 02:54:07.336
A LOT OF SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS, I

02:54:07.403 --> 02:54:08.838
MIGHT ADD, AS WE ALL KNOW, IN

02:54:08.905 --> 02:54:11.374
THOSE NON-BASIC AID DISTRICTS,

02:54:11.440 --> 02:54:13.776
THERE'S NOT A UNIFIED BLOC OF
