00:37:45.663 --> 00:37:46.397
WELCOME TO THE ASSEMBLY

00:37:46.464 --> 00:37:48.432
COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES.

00:37:48.499 --> 00:37:50.868
WE ARE ONE MEMBER SHY OF A

00:37:50.935 --> 00:37:53.070
QUORUM, SO WE'RE GOING TO START

00:37:53.137 --> 00:37:55.373
AS A SUBCOMMITTEE. I SEE SENATOR

00:37:55.439 --> 00:37:59.677
BLAKE SPEAR IS HERE. SENATOR,

00:37:59.744 --> 00:38:14.091
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.

00:38:14.158 --> 00:38:16.093
WELL, THANK YOU, CHAIR BRYAN.

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:19.096
AND THANK YOU, COMMITTEE MEMBERS

00:38:19.163 --> 00:38:23.367

00:38:23.434 --> 00:38:23.868
ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE

00:38:23.934 --> 00:38:27.405
AMENDMENTS ON SB 14. SB 14 IS A

00:38:27.471 --> 00:38:29.073
MEASURE THAT WOULD POSITION

00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:30.474
CALIFORNIA STATE AGENCIES AND

00:38:30.541 --> 00:38:32.176
OPERATIONS AS A LEADER FOR WASTE

00:38:32.243 --> 00:38:33.711
REDUCTION AND THE CIRCULAR

00:38:33.778 --> 00:38:35.179
ECONOMY. EVERYDAY CALIFORNIANS

00:38:35.246 --> 00:38:37.882
SEND 12,000 TONS OF PLASTIC TO

00:38:37.948 --> 00:38:38.883
LANDFILLS ACROSS THE UNITED

00:38:38.949 --> 00:38:41.185
STATES. ONLY 5 TO 6% OF PLASTIC

00:38:41.252 --> 00:38:43.921
WAS RECYCLED IN 2021. WASTE THAT

00:38:43.988 --> 00:38:45.523
ISN'T SENT TO LANDFILLS OFTEN

00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:46.524
ENDS UP POLLUTING COMMUNITIES

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:48.659
AND THE ENVIRONMENT. SINGLE USE

00:38:48.726 --> 00:38:50.194
PLASTICS ARE AMONG THE MOST

00:38:50.261 --> 00:38:51.362
WASTEFUL AND HARMFUL PRODUCTS IN

00:38:51.429 --> 00:38:54.598
OUR SOCIETY. ONE WAY TO TACKLE

00:38:54.665 --> 00:38:55.566
THE PROBLEM AND REDUCE THE

00:38:55.633 --> 00:38:56.767
ENORMOUS FLOW OF WASTE IS TO

00:38:56.834 --> 00:38:58.969
MOVE TO A CIRCULAR ECONOMY WHICH

00:38:59.036 --> 00:39:00.971
FOCUSES ON REDUCING, REUSING AND

00:39:01.038 --> 00:39:03.607
RECYCLING PRODUCTS. SB 14 WOULD

00:39:03.674 --> 00:39:05.109
REQUIRE STATE FACILITIES TO TAKE

00:39:05.176 --> 00:39:06.811
THE LEAD IN REDUCING AND

00:39:06.877 --> 00:39:09.113
RECYCLING PLASTIC AND ORGANIC

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:10.047
MATERIALS AS PART OF THEIR

00:39:10.114 --> 00:39:11.449
INTEGRATED WASTE MANAGEMENT

00:39:11.515 --> 00:39:14.151
PLANS. RIGHT NOW, EACH STATE

00:39:14.218 --> 00:39:14.885
AGENCY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:39:14.952 --> 00:39:16.253
DEVELOPING AN INTEGRATED WASTE

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.655
MANAGEMENT PLAN TO DIVERT 50% OF

00:39:17.722 --> 00:39:19.390
THE WASTE GENERATED AT STATE

00:39:19.457 --> 00:39:22.293
FACILITIES FROM LANDFILLS. SB 14

00:39:22.359 --> 00:39:24.929
ADVOCATES THE GOALS OF THE STATE

00:39:24.995 --> 00:39:26.931
AGENCY WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN TO

00:39:26.997 --> 00:39:28.532
SPECIFICALLY ACHIEVE 50%

00:39:28.599 --> 00:39:29.600
REUSABLE FOODWARE AT STATE

00:39:29.667 --> 00:39:31.669
FACILITIES BY 2030, AND REDUCE

00:39:31.736 --> 00:39:34.972
PAPER PURCHASING BY 30% BY 2030.

00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:36.707
SB 14 ALSO UPDATES THE

00:39:36.774 --> 00:39:37.641
INTEGRATED WASTE MANAGEMENT

00:39:37.708 --> 00:39:40.044
PLANS TO REQUIRE ACTIONS TO

00:39:40.111 --> 00:39:41.579
PROVIDE ADEQUATE EDUCATIONAL

00:39:41.645 --> 00:39:43.214
TOOLS TO INFORM STATE AGENCY

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:44.148
EMPLOYEES ON HOW TO PROPERLY

00:39:44.215 --> 00:39:46.050
SORT MATERIALS FOR COMPOST AND

00:39:46.117 --> 00:39:47.785
RECYCLING, AND ENSURE THAT

00:39:47.852 --> 00:39:48.919
RECYCLABLE AND ORGANIC MATERIAL

00:39:48.986 --> 00:39:50.988
REACH RESPONSIBLE END MARKETS.

00:39:51.055 --> 00:39:53.357
SB 14 PUSHES STATE AGENCIES TO

00:39:53.424 --> 00:39:55.092
CHART A COURSE TOWARD BETTER

00:39:55.159 --> 00:39:55.826
EDUCATION FOR SORTING WASTE AT

00:39:55.893 --> 00:39:57.561
STATE FACILITIES, AND TO BETTER

00:39:57.628 --> 00:39:59.396
ENSURE THAT PLASTIC AND ORGANIC

00:39:59.463 --> 00:40:00.297
MATERIALS LEAVING STATE

00:40:00.364 --> 00:40:01.999
FACILITIES ACTUALLY GETS

00:40:02.066 --> 00:40:03.000
RECYCLED ONCE IT LEAVES THE

00:40:03.067 --> 00:40:05.336
STATE BUILDINGS. MY COLLEAGUES

00:40:05.402 --> 00:40:07.104
KNOW THAT I AM PASSIONATE ABOUT

00:40:07.171 --> 00:40:08.339
REDUCING SINGLE USE PLASTICS,

00:40:08.405 --> 00:40:09.940
AND I HOPE THAT WE AS LEADERS,

00:40:10.007 --> 00:40:12.209
MOVE AWAY FROM USING SINGLE USE

00:40:12.276 --> 00:40:14.044
PLASTIC BOTTLES AND MORE FULLY

00:40:14.111 --> 00:40:15.513
EMBRACE REUSABLE BOTTLES,

00:40:15.579 --> 00:40:16.947
CARAFES, OR PITCHERS FOR

00:40:17.014 --> 00:40:18.449
MEETINGS AND EVENTS RATHER THAN

00:40:18.516 --> 00:40:21.118
SO MUCH SINGLE USE SB 14 WILL

00:40:21.185 --> 00:40:22.787
HELP STEER US TOWARD THAT GOAL.

00:40:22.853 --> 00:40:24.622
IN ADDITION TO ENSURING BEST

00:40:24.688 --> 00:40:25.589
PRACTICES WITH SOURCE REDUCTION

00:40:25.656 --> 00:40:27.224
AND RECYCLING FOR MATERIAL AT

00:40:27.291 --> 00:40:29.693
THE END OF ITS LIFE, SB 14 ALSO

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:30.594
LEVERAGES THE STATE'S

00:40:30.661 --> 00:40:32.463
CONSIDERABLE PURCHASING POWER TO

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:34.298
SUPPORT RECYCLING MARKETS BY

00:40:34.365 --> 00:40:35.699
REQUIRING THAT ALL STATE

00:40:35.766 --> 00:40:37.234
CONTRACTS FOR SINGLE USE PLASTIC

00:40:37.301 --> 00:40:38.736
BOTTLES MUST SUPPORT MEETING THE

00:40:38.803 --> 00:40:40.070
MINIMUM RECYCLED CONTENT

00:40:40.137 --> 00:40:41.438
STANDARDS THAT WERE SET FORTH BY

00:40:41.505 --> 00:40:44.508
AB 793. SB 14 WOULD NOT PREVENT

00:40:44.575 --> 00:40:46.177
THE STATE FROM PURCHASING THE

00:40:46.243 --> 00:40:47.511
NUMEROUS SUBSTITUTES TO SINGLE

00:40:47.578 --> 00:40:49.847
USE PLASTIC BOTTLES THAT ARE

00:40:49.914 --> 00:40:50.748
ALREADY ON THE MARKET TODAY,

00:40:50.815 --> 00:40:51.582
INCLUDING ALUMINUM BOTTLES AND

00:40:51.649 --> 00:40:53.417
CANS, GLASS BOTTLES, AND

00:40:53.484 --> 00:40:55.286

00:41:00.658 --> 00:41:03.160
AFTERNOON, CHAIR AND MEMBERS.

I'M NEIL EDGAR ON BEHALF OF THE

CALIFORNIA COMPOST COALITION.

00:41:05.996 --> 00:41:07.531
OUR MEMBERS ARE PREDOMINANTLY

00:41:07.598 --> 00:41:09.600
SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR

00:41:09.667 --> 00:41:10.301
MUNICIPALITIES THROUGHOUT

00:41:10.367 --> 00:41:11.669
CALIFORNIA WHO PROCESS YARD

00:41:11.735 --> 00:41:12.837
TRIMMINGS AND, INCREASINGLY,

00:41:12.903 --> 00:41:15.105
FOOD MATERIALS TO MEET THE LOFTY

00:41:15.172 --> 00:41:17.174
CLIMATE GOALS PRESCRIBED IN SB

00:41:17.241 --> 00:41:19.343
1383, CAL RECYCLE IS PREDICTED

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:20.811
THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO DOUBLE

00:41:20.878 --> 00:41:21.946
OUR EXISTING CAPACITY, ADDING

00:41:22.012 --> 00:41:25.149
SOME 50 TO 100 FACILITIES IN

00:41:25.216 --> 00:41:26.684
MANY AREAS OF THE STATE. IT'S

00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:28.018
DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP ENOUGH OF A

00:41:28.085 --> 00:41:29.587
REVENUE STREAM TO FUND THE

00:41:29.653 --> 00:41:30.221
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED

00:41:30.287 --> 00:41:31.789
TO MEET COMMUNITY AND REGIONAL

00:41:31.856 --> 00:41:33.791

00:41:35.292 --> 00:41:36.927

BUILDING AND OPERATING COST

00:41:38.529 --> 00:41:40.197
EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS. THIS BILL

00:41:40.264 --> 00:41:41.265
WOULD ENCOURAGE STATE

00:41:41.332 --> 00:41:41.999
DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES TO BE

00:41:42.066 --> 00:41:43.834
AN ACTIVE CONTRIBUTOR TO

00:41:44.902 --> 00:41:46.704
PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE. IN

00:41:46.770 --> 00:41:47.838
MANY AREAS, THE ADDITIONAL

00:41:47.905 --> 00:41:49.573
MATERIALS COLLECTED AND

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:50.541
PROCESSED CAN BE A TIPPING POINT

00:41:50.608 --> 00:41:52.176
TO GETTING MORE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:41:52.243 --> 00:41:53.010
BUILT, PARTICULARLY IN RURAL

00:41:53.077 --> 00:41:54.478
AREAS WHERE MANY STATE

00:41:54.545 --> 00:41:56.180
INSTITUTIONS REPRESENT A

00:41:56.247 --> 00:41:56.814
DISPROPORTIONATE PERCENTAGE OF

00:41:56.881 --> 00:41:58.849
THE POPULATION. MORE

00:41:58.916 --> 00:42:00.050
IMPORTANTLY, THE STATE CAN

00:42:00.117 --> 00:42:01.518
DEMONSTRATE ITS ABILITY TO TRULY

00:42:01.585 --> 00:42:02.887
LEAD AND HELP ACHIEVE THE

00:42:02.953 --> 00:42:03.888
IMPORTANT LANDFILL DIVERSION,

00:42:03.954 --> 00:42:05.489

BEFORE AND JUST WANT TO THANK

00:46:12.836 --> 00:46:13.437
THE SENATOR FOR INCREDIBLE WORK.

00:46:13.504 --> 00:46:14.505
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE? YES.

00:46:14.571 --> 00:46:15.739
THANK YOU. WELL, EVEN THOUGH ONE

00:46:15.806 --> 00:46:17.674
OF MY PRIMARY WITNESSES ARRIVED

00:46:17.741 --> 00:46:19.143
CARRYING A PLASTIC WATER BOTTLE,

00:46:19.209 --> 00:46:19.743
WE ARE WE ARE ACTUALLY WE ARE

00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:21.378
TRYING TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE

00:46:21.445 --> 00:46:23.480
STATE. I'VE REUSED THIS WATER

00:46:23.547 --> 00:46:31.455
BOTTLE FOR A MONTH. TRUE STORY.

00:46:31.522 --> 00:46:34.658
SORRY, MISS. DID YOU. WE WOULD

00:46:34.725 --> 00:46:36.727
LIKE TO HAVE THE STATE BE A

00:46:36.793 --> 00:46:39.296
LEADER. SO TO LEAD BY EXAMPLE,

00:46:39.363 --> 00:46:41.498
BY UTILIZING LESS SINGLE USE

00:46:41.565 --> 00:46:45.135
PLASTIC, MORE REUSABLE AND MORE

00:46:45.202 --> 00:46:48.338
COMPOSTABLE AND ACTUALLY HAVING

00:46:48.405 --> 00:46:49.940
SOME FOLLOW UP LIKE FOR EXAMPLE,

00:46:50.007 --> 00:46:53.110
IN THIS BUILDING IF WE TRACK OR

00:46:53.177 --> 00:46:54.978
DO WE OR DO WE NOT TRACK WHERE

00:46:55.045 --> 00:46:56.813
OUR WASTE GOES, WHAT AMOUNT IS

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:57.915
GOING TO THE LANDFILL? WHAT

00:46:57.981 --> 00:46:59.783
PERCENTAGE IS BEING RECYCLED OR

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:00.951
COMPOSTED? ARE WE FOLLOWING THE

00:47:01.018 --> 00:47:02.719
STATE LAWS? THERE ARE MANY

00:47:02.786 --> 00:47:05.255
EXAMPLES OF STATE AGENCIES THAT

00:47:05.322 --> 00:47:06.423
COULD DO BETTER IN THIS AREA.

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:08.792
AND BECAUSE WE ARE THE STATE OF

00:47:08.859 --> 00:47:10.294
CALIFORNIA, I THINK THAT THIS IS

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:12.062
SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY SORELY

00:47:12.129 --> 00:47:14.364
NEEDED AND IN MANY WAYS MAYBE

00:47:14.431 --> 00:47:16.133
OVERDUE. SO I APPRECIATE THE

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:17.901
SUPPORT OF THE COMMITTEE. AND I

00:47:17.968 --> 00:47:18.869
RECOGNIZE THAT THE MOST

00:47:18.936 --> 00:47:20.404
CONTROVERSIAL PART OF THIS BILL

00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:24.274
HAS BEEN REMOVED. AND SO NOW I'M

00:47:24.341 --> 00:47:25.475
I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE'LL BE ABLE

00:47:25.542 --> 00:47:27.211
TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE REST OF

00:47:27.277 --> 00:47:28.679
IT. AND I APPRECIATE YOUR

00:47:28.745 --> 00:47:29.413

ASKED. SECTOR 66. OKAY,

00:49:27.898 --> 00:49:28.932
ABSOLUTELY. PRESENTING FOR

00:49:28.999 --> 00:49:31.401
SENATOR BECKER ON SB 326 IS

00:49:31.468 --> 00:49:35.339
ASSEMBLY MEMBER PELLERIN. OKAY,

00:49:35.405 --> 00:49:36.807

WE'RE READY WHEN YOU ARE OKAY.

00:50:00.597 --> 00:50:02.632
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR.

00:50:02.699 --> 00:50:04.968
AND MEMBERS. SB 326 IS AN

00:50:05.035 --> 00:50:06.737
IMPORTANT STEP FOR CALIFORNIA IN

00:50:06.803 --> 00:50:09.606
TERMS OF MANAGING WILDFIRE RISK.

00:50:09.673 --> 00:50:12.075
LET ME BEGIN ON BEHALF OF

00:50:12.142 --> 00:50:13.477
SENATOR BECKER TO ACCEPT THE

00:50:13.543 --> 00:50:15.212
COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS

00:50:15.278 --> 00:50:18.181
ON PAGE 13 OF THE BILL. ANALYSIS

00:50:18.248 --> 00:50:19.549
CALIFORNIA IS LOSING TOO MANY

00:50:19.616 --> 00:50:21.151
HOUSES AND COMMUNITIES TO

00:50:21.218 --> 00:50:23.520
WILDFIRE. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE,

00:50:23.587 --> 00:50:26.423
THAT IS DRIVING TWIN CRISES IN

00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:28.425
AFFORDABILITY OF ELECTRICITY AND

00:50:28.492 --> 00:50:29.393
AVAILABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY

00:50:29.459 --> 00:50:31.962
OF HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE. THE

00:50:32.028 --> 00:50:33.630
FIRST CRISIS THREATENS THE CLEAN

00:50:33.697 --> 00:50:36.099
ENERGY TRANSITION. THE SECOND IS

00:50:36.166 --> 00:50:37.801
BECOMING A MAJOR COMPLICATING

00:50:37.868 --> 00:50:39.202
FACTOR FOR MAKING PROGRESS ON

00:50:39.269 --> 00:50:42.038
HOUSING AFFORDABILITY. AS SUCH,

00:50:42.105 --> 00:50:43.774
WILDFIRE HAS BECOME A MAJOR

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:46.276
DRIVER FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT

00:50:46.343 --> 00:50:47.110
AFFORDABILITY ISSUES CONFRONTING

00:50:47.177 --> 00:50:49.880
THE STATE AND THE NATION. AS

00:50:49.946 --> 00:50:51.982
AMENDED, SB 326 DOES TWO THINGS

00:50:52.048 --> 00:50:54.584
TO ADDRESS THE TWIN CRISES I'M

00:50:54.651 --> 00:50:56.286
SPEAKING OF. FIRST, IT WOULD

00:50:56.353 --> 00:50:58.822
CREATE A FRAMEWORK FOR CAL FIRE

00:50:58.889 --> 00:51:00.457
TO SYSTEMATICALLY EVALUATE AND

00:51:00.524 --> 00:51:02.159
QUANTIFY THE RISK REDUCTION

00:51:02.225 --> 00:51:03.860
BENEFITS OF FUELS MANAGEMENT AND

00:51:03.927 --> 00:51:06.096
LANDSCAPE RESILIENCE INVESTMENTS

00:51:06.163 --> 00:51:07.964
MADE BY GOVERNMENT AND

00:51:08.031 --> 00:51:10.100
NON-GOVERNMENT ACTORS. THIS IS

00:51:10.167 --> 00:51:11.435
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT WILL HELP

00:51:11.501 --> 00:51:12.736
FOCUS PLANNING AND RESOURCES ON

00:51:12.803 --> 00:51:14.471
THE PROJECTS WITH THE GREATEST

00:51:14.538 --> 00:51:16.907
POTENTIAL TO REDUCE RISK.

00:51:16.973 --> 00:51:19.142
SECOND, SB 326 WOULD INCREASE

00:51:19.209 --> 00:51:20.544
EARLY IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:23.113
PENDING ZONE ZERO BUILDING

00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:24.915
STANDARDS, ALSO KNOWN AS EMBER

00:51:24.981 --> 00:51:27.050
FREE ZONE BUILDING STANDARDS, TO

00:51:27.117 --> 00:51:28.084
ACCELERATE WHAT HAS BEEN

00:51:28.151 --> 00:51:29.686
ACKNOWLEDGED AS ONE OF THE MOST,

00:51:29.753 --> 00:51:31.555
IF NOT THE MOST EFFECTIVE

00:51:31.621 --> 00:51:33.356
DEFENSIVE SPACE ACTION

00:51:33.423 --> 00:51:35.192
HOMEOWNERS CAN TAKE TO PROTECT

00:51:35.258 --> 00:51:36.793
THEIR HOMES FROM WILDFIRE

00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:39.262
DESTRUCTION. WITH REGARD TO THE

00:51:39.329 --> 00:51:40.997
STRATEGIC PLANNING FRAMEWORK

00:51:41.064 --> 00:51:42.866
PROVISIONS, SB 326 WOULD FOCUS

00:51:42.933 --> 00:51:44.434
THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S DEPUTY

00:51:44.501 --> 00:51:45.802
OF COMMUNITY WILDFIRE

00:51:45.869 --> 00:51:47.137
PREPAREDNESS AND MITIGATION TO

00:51:47.204 --> 00:51:50.106
DO THREE THINGS AS PERTAINING TO

00:51:50.173 --> 00:51:52.209
ADVANCING COMPREHENSIVE WILDFIRE

00:51:52.275 --> 00:51:54.411
MITIGATION PLANNING ONE. DEVELOP

00:51:54.478 --> 00:51:56.546
A WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLANNING

00:51:56.613 --> 00:51:58.381
FRAMEWORK TO QUANTITATIVELY

00:51:58.448 --> 00:52:00.183
EVALUATE ALTERNATIVE WILDFIRE

00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:02.319
RISK MITIGATION ACTIONS. DEVELOP

00:52:02.385 --> 00:52:05.055
A WILDFIRE RISK BASELINE, AND

00:52:05.121 --> 00:52:06.523
FORECAST TO ADDRESS RISK FROM

00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:08.558
FIRE IGNITIONS AND THE EXTENT

00:52:08.625 --> 00:52:10.594
THAT THE RISK CAN BE REDUCED.

00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:12.696
AND THIRD, DEVELOP A WILDFIRE

00:52:12.762 --> 00:52:14.231
MITIGATION SCENARIOS REPORT WITH

00:52:14.297 --> 00:52:16.733
A RANGE OF WILDFIRE MITIGATION

00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:19.169
INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND HOW

00:52:19.236 --> 00:52:21.338
ONE COMPARES TO THE OTHER.

00:52:21.404 --> 00:52:23.507
TODAY, CAL FIRE USES ITS OWN

00:52:23.573 --> 00:52:24.908
JUDGMENT IN DECIDING WHICH

00:52:24.975 --> 00:52:26.309
PROJECTS TO CONDUCT ITSELF AND

00:52:26.376 --> 00:52:28.879
WHAT GRANT APPLICATIONS TO FUND.

00:52:28.945 --> 00:52:30.380
THIS OFTEN MEANS THAT THE

00:52:30.447 --> 00:52:32.482
EASIEST ACRES TO TREAT GET DONE,

00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:34.684
RATHER THAN THE ONES MOST

00:52:34.751 --> 00:52:36.753
IMPORTANT FOR REDUCING RISK.

00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:38.255
CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE IMPOSES

00:52:38.321 --> 00:52:39.589
ENORMOUS COSTS ON THE STATE OF

00:52:39.656 --> 00:52:41.525
CALIFORNIA AND ITS RESIDENTS. WE

00:52:41.591 --> 00:52:43.927
ARE OBLIGED TO PRIORITIZE OUR

00:52:43.994 --> 00:52:45.795
MITIGATION EFFORTS AMONG ALL

00:52:45.862 --> 00:52:47.197
ACTORS TO ACHIEVE THE MAXIMUM

00:52:47.264 --> 00:52:49.399
REDUCTION IN WILDFIRE FREQUENCY,

00:52:49.466 --> 00:52:50.834
SCOPE AND INTENSITY THROUGH

00:52:50.901 --> 00:52:52.636
TARGETED INVESTMENTS. THAT'S

00:52:52.702 --> 00:52:54.704
WHAT THE PLANNING FRAMEWORK SB

00:52:54.771 --> 00:52:57.307
326 CAN HELP ACCOMPLISH. WITH

00:52:57.374 --> 00:52:59.209
REGARD TO THE ZONE ZERO

00:52:59.276 --> 00:53:00.143

VERY HIGH WILDFIRE THREAT

00:53:04.714 --> 00:53:06.716
SEVERITY ZONE TO IMPLEMENT AND

00:53:06.783 --> 00:53:08.218
ENFORCE THESE THESE DEFENSIVE

00:53:08.285 --> 00:53:10.854
SPACE STANDARDS. THIS BILL ALSO

00:53:10.921 --> 00:53:12.188
EXPANDS THE RANGE OF HOMES TO

00:53:12.255 --> 00:53:14.124
WHICH ZONE ZERO REGULATIONS WILL

00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:16.760

00:53:20.897 --> 00:53:23.199
WOULD CONTINUE TO HAVE THREE

00:53:34.444 --> 00:53:36.112
FUTURE WILDFIRES. AND HERE WITH

00:53:36.179 --> 00:53:39.182

00:53:48.258 --> 00:53:49.693
YOU, CHAIR BRIAN. THANK YOU TO

00:53:49.759 --> 00:53:50.827
THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AS WELL

00:53:50.894 --> 00:53:52.429
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE.

00:53:52.495 --> 00:53:54.331
AND AS WE'VE HEARD, MY NAME IS

00:53:54.397 --> 00:53:54.931
MICHAEL MASTRANDREA. I'M THE

00:53:54.998 --> 00:53:56.099
RESEARCH DIRECTOR OF STANFORD'S

00:53:56.166 --> 00:53:57.200
CLIMATE AND ENERGY POLICY

00:53:57.267 --> 00:53:58.969
PROGRAM, AND I'M SPEAKING IN MY

00:53:59.035 --> 00:53:59.703
PERSONAL CAPACITY TODAY AS A

00:53:59.769 --> 00:54:01.838
CLIMATE SCIENTIST AND A WILDFIRE

00:54:01.905 --> 00:54:02.772
POLICY EXPERT, I AND MY TEAM

00:54:02.839 --> 00:54:04.007
CONDUCT RESEARCH AND WORK WITH

00:54:04.074 --> 00:54:05.308
POLICY MAKERS TO ADDRESS THE

00:54:05.375 --> 00:54:06.509
CAUSES AND IMPACTS OF

00:54:06.576 --> 00:54:09.012
CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. SB 326

00:54:09.079 --> 00:54:10.413
IS AN IMPORTANT STEP FOR

00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:11.648
CALIFORNIA TO MAKE PROGRESS ON

00:54:11.715 --> 00:54:13.049
REDUCING WILDFIRE RISK. AS WE'VE

00:54:13.116 --> 00:54:14.351
HEARD, WE'RE LOSING TOO MANY

00:54:14.417 --> 00:54:16.319
HOMES AND COMMUNITIES TO

00:54:16.386 --> 00:54:17.921
WILDFIRE, AND I WANT TO FOCUS MY

00:54:17.988 --> 00:54:19.389
COMMENTS ON WHY ZONE ZERO IS SO

00:54:19.456 --> 00:54:20.790
IMPORTANT AS A KEY COMPONENT OF

00:54:20.857 --> 00:54:22.626
WILDFIRE RISK REDUCTION, AND WHY

00:54:22.692 --> 00:54:24.694
SB 326, AS AMENDED, IS IMPORTANT

00:54:24.761 --> 00:54:26.763
IN ACCELERATING ZONE ZERO

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:28.264
IMPLEMENTATION. THE LEGISLATURE

00:54:28.331 --> 00:54:29.432
AND GOVERNOR NEWSOM HAVE

00:54:29.499 --> 00:54:30.900
RECOGNIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF

00:54:30.967 --> 00:54:32.068
ZONE ZERO, AND THIS IS SUPPORTED

00:54:32.135 --> 00:54:33.370
BY SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH THAT

00:54:33.436 --> 00:54:35.872
SHOWS ZERO TO BE ONE OF THE MOST

00:54:35.939 --> 00:54:37.073
IMPORTANT FACTORS IN DETERMINING

00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:37.574
HOME SURVIVAL. IN BOTH

00:54:37.641 --> 00:54:38.875
CONTROLLED EXPERIMENTS AND

00:54:38.942 --> 00:54:40.944
POST-FIRE ANALYSIS OF LOSSES. I

00:54:41.011 --> 00:54:42.512
WOULD POINT, FOR EXAMPLE, TO

00:54:42.579 --> 00:54:43.713
RECENT RESEARCH BY PROFESSOR

00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:46.483
MICHAEL GOLDNER AT UC BERKELEY,

00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:49.019
WORK LED BY ERIC KNAPP AT THE US

00:54:49.085 --> 00:54:49.552
FOREST SERVICE AND JOANNA

00:54:49.619 --> 00:54:51.221
VELICOVICH AT THE UC COOPERATIVE

00:54:51.287 --> 00:54:52.622
EXTENSION, AND RESEARCH REPORTS

00:54:52.689 --> 00:54:54.324
FROM THE INSURANCE INSTITUTE FOR

00:54:54.391 --> 00:54:55.692
BUSINESS AND HOME SAFETY, ALL OF

00:54:55.759 --> 00:54:56.793
WHICH SUPPORT THE IMPORTANCE OF

00:54:56.860 --> 00:54:59.229
ZONE ZERO. THIS IS PARTICULARLY

00:54:59.295 --> 00:55:00.997
TRUE IN EXISTING NEIGHBORHOODS,

00:55:01.064 --> 00:55:02.399
WHERE OTHER IMPORTANT FACTORS,

00:55:02.465 --> 00:55:04.334
LIKE THE AGE OF STRUCTURES AND

00:55:04.401 --> 00:55:06.102
THE SPACE BETWEEN STRUCTURES ARE

00:55:06.169 --> 00:55:07.404
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT, IF NOT

00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:10.540
IMPOSSIBLE, TO CHANGE AT SCALE.

00:55:10.607 --> 00:55:11.641
GOVERNOR NEWSOM HAS DIRECTED CAL

00:55:11.708 --> 00:55:13.176
FIRE TO ISSUE ZONE ZERO

00:55:13.243 --> 00:55:14.544
REGULATIONS BY THE END OF THIS

00:55:14.611 --> 00:55:16.479
YEAR, AND SB 326, AS AMENDED,

00:55:16.546 --> 00:55:17.547
WOULD EXPAND THE CATEGORIES OF

00:55:17.614 --> 00:55:19.416
HOMES WHERE ZONE ZERO WILL APPLY

00:55:19.482 --> 00:55:20.984
WITHOUT A THREE YEAR PHASE IN

00:55:21.051 --> 00:55:22.419
ZONE ZERO IS MORE EFFECTIVE THE

00:55:22.485 --> 00:55:24.254
MORE HOMES IN A COMMUNITY

00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:25.722
IMPLEMENT PROTECTIVE MEASURES,

00:55:25.789 --> 00:55:26.990
SO ACCELERATING IMPLEMENTATION

00:55:27.057 --> 00:55:28.958
WILL MOVE US FASTER TOWARD

00:55:29.025 --> 00:55:29.993
MEANINGFUL RISK REDUCTION IN THE

00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:32.262
NEXT THREE YEARS. SB 326 WOULD

00:55:32.328 --> 00:55:33.496
ALSO CREATE INCENTIVES TO HELP

00:55:33.563 --> 00:55:34.964
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HIRE

00:55:35.031 --> 00:55:36.499
INSPECTORS AND PROVIDE GRANTS TO

00:55:36.566 --> 00:55:37.634
HOMEOWNERS TO IMPLEMENT ZONE

00:55:37.701 --> 00:55:40.804
ZERO. THIS, TOO, IS INTENDED TO

00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:41.905
ADVANCE IMPLEMENTATION AND

00:55:41.971 --> 00:55:43.506
ENABLES NEW RESOURCES TO BE MADE

00:55:43.573 --> 00:55:45.341
AVAILABLE FOR THIS PURPOSE. THIS

00:55:45.408 --> 00:55:46.409
BILL IS AMENDED, ADVANCES

00:55:46.476 --> 00:55:47.677
CRITICAL MEASURES TO BETTER

00:55:47.744 --> 00:55:48.645
SAFEGUARD OUR COMMUNITIES, AND

00:55:48.712 --> 00:55:50.647
TO LOSE FEWER, FEWER HOMES WHEN

00:55:50.714 --> 00:55:51.748

DILIGENTLY WITH ME AND MY OFFICE

00:59:16.252 --> 00:59:17.687
ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT AND

00:59:17.754 --> 00:59:21.457
TIMELY MEASURE, SB 34, WHILE

00:59:21.524 --> 00:59:23.359
SIMULTANEOUSLY CONTINUING TO

00:59:23.426 --> 00:59:25.295
IMPROVE AIR QUALITY IN THE

00:59:25.361 --> 00:59:26.896
COMMUNITIES SURROUNDING THE SAN

00:59:26.963 --> 00:59:29.499
PEDRO PORT COMPLEX AREA AND

00:59:29.565 --> 00:59:31.501
PROTECTING JOBS IN OUR FRAGILE

00:59:31.567 --> 00:59:33.369
ECONOMY. I'M ACCEPTING THOSE

00:59:33.436 --> 00:59:35.905
PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TODAY IN

00:59:35.972 --> 00:59:37.307
TERMS OF THE SCALE AND SCOPE OF

00:59:37.373 --> 00:59:38.808
THE PORTS OF LOS ANGELES AND

00:59:38.875 --> 00:59:40.843
LONG BEACH, THEY ARE THE LARGEST

00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:42.745
SINGLE INTERMODAL COMMERCIAL

00:59:42.812 --> 00:59:44.547
GATEWAY IN THE STATE OF

00:59:44.614 --> 00:59:46.683
CALIFORNIA, THE UNITED STATES,

00:59:46.749 --> 00:59:48.885
NORTH AMERICA, AND THE WESTERN

00:59:48.952 --> 00:59:51.421
HEMISPHERE. THE COMPLEX SUPPORTS

00:59:51.487 --> 00:59:53.556
3 MILLION JOBS NATIONWIDE AND

00:59:53.623 --> 00:59:55.591
SUPPORTS ECONOMIC ACTIVITY THAT

00:59:55.658 --> 00:59:57.894
GENERATES 2.78 BILLION IN STATE

00:59:57.961 --> 01:00:00.330
AND LOCAL TAXES, PLUS AN

01:00:00.396 --> 01:00:02.966
ADDITIONAL 4.73 BILLION IN

01:00:03.032 --> 01:00:06.102
FEDERAL TAXES IN 2022. IT IS

01:00:06.169 --> 01:00:07.704
FAIR TO SAY THIS PORT COMPLEX IS

01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:09.439
A TREMENDOUS ASSET TO THE STATE

01:00:09.505 --> 01:00:12.508
OF CALIFORNIA AND TO THE NATION.

01:00:12.575 --> 01:00:14.444
YET, ALONG WITH THIS AMOUNT OF

01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:15.712
ACTIVITY, THE PORTS ARE MINDFUL

01:00:15.778 --> 01:00:17.547
OF THE AIR QUALITY WITHIN THE

01:00:17.613 --> 01:00:20.750
AREA. AFTER ALL, WE LIVE HERE

01:00:20.817 --> 01:00:22.952
TOO. AND TO ITS CREDIT, THE

01:00:23.019 --> 01:00:24.921
PORTS HAVE MADE TREMENDOUS

01:00:24.988 --> 01:00:26.289
STRIDES TO IMPROVE THE AIR

01:00:26.356 --> 01:00:28.057
QUALITY. FOR EXAMPLE, ACCORDING

01:00:28.124 --> 01:00:30.526
TO THE LATEST ANNUAL EMISSIONS

01:00:30.593 --> 01:00:32.362
INVENTORY, THE TOTAL SAN PEDRO

01:00:32.428 --> 01:00:35.732
BAY COMPLEX EMISSIONS OF DIESEL

01:00:35.798 --> 01:00:38.167
PARTICULATE MATTER DECREASED BY

01:00:38.234 --> 01:00:41.938
91%. AGAIN, THAT'S 91%. NITROGEN

01:00:42.005 --> 01:00:46.976
OXIDES DECREASED BY 72%, SULFUR

01:00:47.043 --> 01:00:50.580
OXIDES DECREASED BY 98%, AND

01:00:50.646 --> 01:00:52.782
GREENHOUSE GASES DECREASED BY

01:00:52.849 --> 01:00:55.718
20% COMPARED TO THE 2005

01:00:55.785 --> 01:00:57.720
BASELINE EMISSIONS. IN A

01:00:57.787 --> 01:00:59.655
COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO

01:00:59.722 --> 01:01:01.457
ADDRESS AIR QUALITY, THE PORTS

01:01:01.524 --> 01:01:03.726
OF LOS ANGELES AND LONG BEACH

01:01:03.793 --> 01:01:06.195
ADOPTED A JOINT CLEAN AIR ACTION

01:01:06.262 --> 01:01:08.798
PLAN. THIS WAS VOLUNTARY, AND

01:01:08.865 --> 01:01:10.800
WHAT THEY DID IN THIS PARTICULAR

01:01:10.867 --> 01:01:12.135
REPORT WAS TO UPDATE THEIR

01:01:12.201 --> 01:01:14.670
GOALS, INCLUDING TRANSITIONING

01:01:14.737 --> 01:01:17.340
CARGO HANDLING EQUIPMENT TO ZERO

01:01:17.407 --> 01:01:19.442
EMISSIONS BY 2030 AND

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:22.445
TRANSITIONING ALL TRUCKS TO ZERO

01:01:22.512 --> 01:01:25.181
EMISSIONS BY 2035. GIVEN THE

01:01:25.248 --> 01:01:26.983
CURRENT FLUCTUATION OF THE

01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:29.185
ECONOMY, STUBBORN INFLATION, AND

01:01:29.252 --> 01:01:31.587
THE IMPOSITION OF PENDING

01:01:31.654 --> 01:01:33.556
TARIFFS NOW, IT CERTAINLY IS NOT

01:01:33.623 --> 01:01:35.291
THE TIME TO HINDER PRODUCTIVITY

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:37.860
AT OUR PORTS AND DIVERT FROM A

01:01:37.927 --> 01:01:39.629
PLAN THAT IS WORKING. SO WHAT'S

01:01:39.695 --> 01:01:41.731
THE PROBLEM HERE? MEMBERS OF THE

01:01:41.798 --> 01:01:43.299
SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY

01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:45.735
MANAGEMENT DISTRICT ATTEMPTED A

01:01:45.802 --> 01:01:48.204
PORT INDIRECT SOURCE RULE IN

01:01:48.271 --> 01:01:50.873
2024, WHICH WAS OPPOSED BY BOTH

01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:56.646
MAYORS BASS AND RICHARDSON. REX

01:01:56.712 --> 01:01:57.880
RICHARDSON OF LONG BEACH, YES.

01:01:57.947 --> 01:02:00.783
REX RICHARDSON, NOT MYSELF. AND

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:03.119
AT THE TIME. AND I'M I'M PULLING

01:02:03.186 --> 01:02:04.487
OUT MY RECEIPTS HERE BECAUSE

01:02:04.554 --> 01:02:07.123
WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF INFORMATION

01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:09.492
THAT'S BEEN PRESENTED TO YOU.

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:11.694
WHEN THAT PORT RULE WAS BROUGHT

01:02:11.761 --> 01:02:13.029
FORWARD. THOSE WERE THE

01:02:13.096 --> 01:02:14.831
ORGANIZATIONS THAT CAME OUT IN

01:02:14.897 --> 01:02:17.467
OPPOSITION TO THAT RULE. A

01:02:17.533 --> 01:02:20.703
PRIMARY GOAL OF SB 34 IS TO

01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:23.172
ALLOW THE PORTS AND APPROPRIATE

01:02:23.239 --> 01:02:24.540
STAKEHOLDERS TO CONTINUE IN

01:02:24.607 --> 01:02:26.843
THEIR FOCUS IN MEETING THE CLEAN

01:02:26.909 --> 01:02:30.680
AIR ACTION PLAN. WHAT IS SB 34 S

01:02:30.746 --> 01:02:33.483
PROPOSED DÃ° AND THE AMENDED

01:02:33.549 --> 01:02:35.284
DOCUMENTS THAT WE HAVE ALREADY

01:02:35.351 --> 01:02:37.854
AGREED TO WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:38.988
THIS COMMITTEE AND ITS

01:02:39.055 --> 01:02:41.491
AMENDMENTS, SB 34 IS NARROWED IN

01:02:41.557 --> 01:02:44.127
SCOPE AND CLARIFIES THAT IN THE

01:02:44.193 --> 01:02:46.062
EVENT THAT SOUTH COAST AIR

01:02:46.129 --> 01:02:48.030
QUALITY DISTRICT TAKES AN ACTION

01:02:48.097 --> 01:02:51.234
ON OR AFTER JULY 1ST, 2025, THE

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:52.969
SOUTH COAST BOARD SHALL ENSURE

01:02:53.035 --> 01:02:55.271
THAT THE ACTIONS FULFILLED THE

01:02:55.338 --> 01:02:57.340
SPECIFIED CONDITIONS. SO ONE OF

01:02:57.406 --> 01:02:59.876
THE CONCERNS WAS DID WE GO BACK

01:02:59.942 --> 01:03:01.777
TOO FAR? DID WE GO BACK BEYOND

01:03:01.844 --> 01:03:04.247
THIS YEAR? AND SO THE AMENDMENT

01:03:04.313 --> 01:03:05.281
DRAFTED BY YOUR COMMITTEE, WHICH

01:03:05.348 --> 01:03:07.817
WE GLADLY ACCEPT, MADE SURE TO

01:03:07.884 --> 01:03:09.719
ADDRESS THAT. I UNDERSTAND THAT

01:03:09.785 --> 01:03:11.821
THERE WERE SOME CONCERNS IN THE

01:03:11.888 --> 01:03:13.589
RETROACTIVE NATURE OF THE BILL.

01:03:13.656 --> 01:03:15.391
SO THIS AMENDMENT ENSURES THAT

01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:17.326
NONE OF THE PREVIOUS ACTIONS

01:03:17.393 --> 01:03:19.362
TAKEN BY THE BOARD WOULD BE

01:03:19.428 --> 01:03:21.130
AFFECTED. THE SECOND ONE, THE

01:03:21.197 --> 01:03:22.932
AMENDMENT CLARIFIES THAT THE

01:03:22.999 --> 01:03:24.500
BOARD'S ACTION SHALL NOT IMPOSE

01:03:24.567 --> 01:03:27.570
A CAP ON CARGO AND THROUGHPUT AT

01:03:27.637 --> 01:03:29.839
PORTS, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY.

01:03:29.906 --> 01:03:32.642
IT ALSO CLARIFIES WHAT INACTION

01:03:32.708 --> 01:03:34.710
MEANS THE ADOPTION OR AMENDMENT

01:03:34.777 --> 01:03:36.746
OF A RULE OR REGULATION THAT

01:03:36.812 --> 01:03:38.681
IMPOSES NEW OR ADDITIONAL

01:03:38.748 --> 01:03:40.416
EMISSIONS REDUCTION REQUIREMENTS

01:03:40.483 --> 01:03:43.119
ON SOURCES OF AIR POLLUTION

01:03:43.186 --> 01:03:44.887
ASSOCIATED WITH THE OPERATION OF

01:03:44.954 --> 01:03:46.389
PORTS. AND THEN FINALLY, THERE

01:03:46.455 --> 01:03:49.192
WAS THE CONCERN OF IF THIS

01:03:49.258 --> 01:03:52.094
PARTICULAR MEASURE WENT INTO

01:03:52.161 --> 01:03:53.896
2036. AND SO ANOTHER AMENDMENT

01:03:53.963 --> 01:03:55.364
THAT WAS NEGOTIATED BY YOUR

01:03:55.431 --> 01:03:57.533
COMMITTEE STAFF AND YOUR CHAIR

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.001
WAS TO ENSURE THAT THIS BILL

01:03:59.068 --> 01:04:01.637
WOULD REMAIN IN EFFECT FOR FIVE

01:04:01.704 --> 01:04:06.042
YEARS LESS, WHICH IS 2031. I

01:04:06.108 --> 01:04:07.610
BELIEVE THIS BILL STRIKES THE

01:04:07.677 --> 01:04:09.745
RIGHT BALANCE. WHAT WE'RE

01:04:09.812 --> 01:04:11.581
WORKING TO DO IS WITH THE

01:04:11.647 --> 01:04:13.316
PREVIOUS RULE THAT WAS BROUGHT

01:04:13.382 --> 01:04:15.184
FORWARD, WHICH WAS OPPOSED BY

01:04:15.251 --> 01:04:16.552
MANY ORGANIZATIONS AND THE

01:04:16.619 --> 01:04:18.721
MAYORS OF BOTH OF THOSE CITIES.

01:04:18.788 --> 01:04:20.957
ALL WE HAVE SAID IN SB 34 IS

01:04:21.023 --> 01:04:22.725
THAT THE GROUP SHOULD WORK

01:04:22.792 --> 01:04:24.460
TOGETHER TO ADDRESS ZERO

01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:26.762
EMISSIONS. IN NO WAY DO WE WANT

01:04:26.829 --> 01:04:28.531
TO PAUSE FROM EMISSIONS AND WHAT

01:04:28.598 --> 01:04:30.399
OUR GOALS ARE. BUT WHAT WE DO

01:04:30.466 --> 01:04:32.001
WANT TO MAKE SURE IS EVERYONE'S

01:04:32.068 --> 01:04:34.170
AT THE TABLE AND THOSE WHO ARE

01:04:34.237 --> 01:04:36.305
BEST TO ADDRESS IT ARE AT THAT

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:38.541
TABLE AS WELL. NOW YOU'RE GOING

01:04:38.608 --> 01:04:41.477
TO HEAR SOME PEOPLE TALK ABOUT

01:04:41.544 --> 01:04:44.313
THIS DISTRICT AND SAY IT'S THE

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:45.748
DIRTIEST PLACE IN THE STATE.

01:04:45.815 --> 01:04:46.849
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, NOT TO

01:04:46.916 --> 01:04:48.384
MENTION, I DON'T APPRECIATE

01:04:48.451 --> 01:04:49.685
BEING SAID THAT I LIVE IN THE

01:04:49.752 --> 01:04:52.521
DIRTIEST PLACE IN THE STATE. WHY

01:04:52.588 --> 01:04:54.523
ARE THEY SAYING THAT? LET ME

01:04:54.590 --> 01:04:57.126
POINT OUT TO YOU THE TRUTH. THE

01:04:57.193 --> 01:05:00.830
TRUTH IS THAT THIS AREA IS

01:05:00.896 --> 01:05:02.198
SURROUNDED. THE PORTS ARE DOWN

01:05:02.265 --> 01:05:05.234
HERE, RIGHT? THESE ARE THE TWO

01:05:05.301 --> 01:05:07.203
PORTS. THE PORTS ARE SURROUNDED

01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:10.906
BY LAX. WE'RE SURROUNDED BY ALSO

01:05:10.973 --> 01:05:13.909
LONG BEACH AIRPORT. SO WE DON'T

01:05:13.976 --> 01:05:15.611
CONTROL AIRPLANES. THAT'S

01:05:15.678 --> 01:05:17.213
INTERSTATE COMMERCE. THEN YOU'RE

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:18.581
GOING TO HAVE. WE'RE SURROUNDED

01:05:18.648 --> 01:05:21.117
BY FOUR MAJOR FREEWAYS. YOU HAVE

01:05:21.183 --> 01:05:23.886
THE 405, YOU HAVE THE 110, THE

01:05:23.953 --> 01:05:26.756
91 AND THE 105. WE DON'T CONTROL

01:05:26.822 --> 01:05:28.557
THAT. THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE

01:05:28.624 --> 01:05:29.825
THE GERALD DESMOND BRIDGE WHERE

01:05:29.892 --> 01:05:31.694
ALL THE TRUCKS COME OVER. WE

01:05:31.761 --> 01:05:33.696
DON'T CONTROL THAT EITHER. AND

01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:35.798
THEN YOU HAVE THE ALAMEDA

01:05:35.865 --> 01:05:38.634
CORRIDOR, WHICH IS THE RAIL. SO

01:05:38.701 --> 01:05:40.403
COLLECTIVELY, IS THIS A SOURCE

01:05:40.469 --> 01:05:42.938
OF GREAT EMISSIONS? ABSOLUTELY.

01:05:43.005 --> 01:05:44.874
BUT TO SAY THAT THE PORT ITSELF

01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:47.209
IS THE DIRTIEST AND THE CAUSE OF

01:05:47.276 --> 01:05:49.111
ALL EMISSIONS IN THIS REGION IS

01:05:49.178 --> 01:05:50.980
JUST NOT ACCURATE. NOW, LET ME

01:05:51.047 --> 01:05:52.648
GIVE YOU TWO REASONS TO PROVE

01:05:52.715 --> 01:05:55.151
WHY. ISN'T IT INTERESTING THAT

01:05:55.217 --> 01:05:56.786
WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHEN I WAS ON

01:05:56.852 --> 01:05:58.754
THE CITY COUNCIL IN LONG BEACH

01:05:58.821 --> 01:06:03.125
BACK IN FROM 2000 TO 2007, WE

01:06:03.192 --> 01:06:04.660
DID VARIOUS STUDIES BECAUSE

01:06:04.727 --> 01:06:07.463
THERE WERE CANCER CLUSTERS. YOU

01:06:07.530 --> 01:06:09.198
WOULD THINK IF THIS WAS THE

01:06:09.265 --> 01:06:10.700
DIRTIEST AREA, WHY AREN'T THE

01:06:10.766 --> 01:06:12.134
CANCER CLUSTERS WHERE THE PORTS

01:06:12.201 --> 01:06:13.869
ARE ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, WHERE

01:06:13.936 --> 01:06:17.073
THE CANCER CLUSTER IS ON THE 710

01:06:17.139 --> 01:06:18.708
FREEWAY, WHERE THE TRUCKS GO UP

01:06:18.774 --> 01:06:20.409
AND DOWN? AND THEN THE GRAPH

01:06:20.476 --> 01:06:22.645
THAT I SHOWED YOU THERE, THE

01:06:22.712 --> 01:06:24.413
BIGGEST CHALLENGE AND THE REASON

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:25.848
WHY THE STAKEHOLDERS WANT TO

01:06:25.915 --> 01:06:27.950
WORK TOGETHER AND THE REASON WHY

01:06:28.017 --> 01:06:29.485
THE AMENDMENTS SAY THAT YOU

01:06:29.552 --> 01:06:32.321
CAN'T CREATE AN ACTION OR A RULE

01:06:32.388 --> 01:06:33.789
WITH SOMETHING THAT THE PORTS

01:06:33.856 --> 01:06:36.025
DON'T CONTROL. THAT GRAPH SHOWS

01:06:36.092 --> 01:06:38.461
YOU THAT 63% OF THE EMISSIONS TO

01:06:38.527 --> 01:06:40.396
THE PORT COMES IN THROUGH THE

01:06:40.463 --> 01:06:42.231
VESSELS. WE DON'T CONTROL THAT

01:06:42.298 --> 01:06:43.833
EITHER. IT'S CALLED INTERSTATE

01:06:43.899 --> 01:06:46.435
COMMERCE. GUYS, LADIES AND

01:06:46.502 --> 01:06:48.871
GENTLEMEN, INTERSTATE COMMERCE.

01:06:48.938 --> 01:06:50.973
AND THEN I NOTICED IN THE

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:54.210
ANALYSIS IT STATED THAT ONE OF

01:06:54.276 --> 01:06:56.746
OUR ISSUES IS THE FACT OF

01:06:56.812 --> 01:06:58.981
ELECTRIFICATION. IN ORDER TO

01:06:59.048 --> 01:07:00.649
REMOVE THE EMISSIONS WITH THE

01:07:00.716 --> 01:07:02.852
VESSELS, WE NEED ELECTRIFICATION

01:07:02.918 --> 01:07:06.122
FOR IT TO CONNECT TO. THAT'S A

01:07:06.188 --> 01:07:08.257
200 MEGAWATT STATION. THE PORTS

01:07:08.324 --> 01:07:10.025
DON'T BUILD THE MEGAWATT

01:07:10.092 --> 01:07:13.596
STATION. LADWP DOES. LADWP HAS

01:07:13.662 --> 01:07:17.333
NOT SAID SUBMITTED A PERMIT, HAS

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:19.402
NOT SUBMITTED SITING AND

01:07:19.468 --> 01:07:21.971
ANYTHING RELATED TO IT WILL THE

01:07:22.037 --> 01:07:23.806
PORTS AND THE STAKEHOLDERS

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:25.541
ABSOLUTELY WORK TOGETHER TO GET

01:07:25.608 --> 01:07:27.376
THAT ELECTRIFICATION? BECAUSE

01:07:27.443 --> 01:07:29.945
THAT'S A KEY TO US MEETING OUR

01:07:30.012 --> 01:07:31.714
ZERO EMISSIONS. BUT TO SAY AND

01:07:31.781 --> 01:07:33.849
TO ESTABLISH A RULE THAT WOULD

01:07:33.916 --> 01:07:35.217
INHIBIT THE OPERATIONS OF THE

01:07:35.284 --> 01:07:37.019
PORT BASED UPON SOMETHING THEY

01:07:37.086 --> 01:07:39.588
DO NOT CONTROL AND DO NOT BUILD,

01:07:39.655 --> 01:07:41.457
WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE. AND SO

01:07:41.524 --> 01:07:43.592
THAT'S WHAT SB 34 IS ABOUT. AND

01:07:43.659 --> 01:07:45.761
I JUST WANT TO SAY, AS

01:07:45.828 --> 01:07:47.163
COLLEAGUES, SINCE WHEN DID WE

01:07:47.229 --> 01:07:48.697
NOT SUPPORT LEGISLATION THAT

01:07:48.764 --> 01:07:50.766
SAID PEOPLE, LET'S COME TOGETHER

01:07:50.833 --> 01:07:52.902
AND WORK TOGETHER ON THE BEST

01:07:52.968 --> 01:07:54.703
SOLUTION. AND THAT'S WHAT SB 34

01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:56.939
IS ABOUT. WITH THAT, I WILL

01:07:57.006 --> 01:07:58.574
PAUSE. I HAVE A FEW REMAINING

01:07:58.641 --> 01:08:00.810
COMMENTS DEPENDING UPON IF YOUR

01:08:00.876 --> 01:08:03.345
QUESTIONS PULL THEM OUT, BUT WE

01:08:03.412 --> 01:08:07.049

WITH US ON THOSE AMENDMENTS FOR

01:08:26.902 --> 01:08:28.204
THE COMMITTEE. WE'VE BEEN

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:30.739
WORKING ON AMENDMENTS SINCE THE

01:08:30.806 --> 01:08:32.208
BILL WAS IN SENATE NATURAL

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:33.242
RESOURCES WITH OPPOSITION, BUT

01:08:33.309 --> 01:08:36.312
THEY CONTINUED TO EXPRESS OTHER

01:08:36.378 --> 01:08:37.847
CONCERNS AND NOT REMOVE THEIR

01:08:37.913 --> 01:08:39.849
OPPOSITION. SO THE IOW HAS A 90

01:08:39.915 --> 01:08:40.883
YEAR HISTORY OF LOADING AND

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:42.017
UNLOADING SHIPS, TRUCKS, TRAINS

01:08:42.084 --> 01:08:43.953
AT THE PORTS OF L.A. AND LONG

01:08:44.019 --> 01:08:45.788
BEACH. DURING THAT TIME, OUR

01:08:45.855 --> 01:08:47.990
MEMBERS HAVE ADAPTED AND

01:08:48.057 --> 01:08:49.525
WELCOMED NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT

01:08:49.592 --> 01:08:52.461
REDUCE AIR POLLUTION. WE WANT

01:08:52.528 --> 01:08:54.430
CLEAN AIR. OUR MEMBERS WORK IN

01:08:54.497 --> 01:08:55.731
THOSE COMMUNITIES. OUR FAMILIES

01:08:55.798 --> 01:08:57.633
WORK IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. OUR

01:08:57.700 --> 01:09:01.637
MEMBERS HAVE BUSINESS IN THOSE

01:09:01.704 --> 01:09:02.538
COMMUNITIES. SO WE WANT CLEAN

01:09:02.605 --> 01:09:04.340
AIR LIKE NO ONE ELSE DOES.

01:09:04.406 --> 01:09:06.609
TODAY, WE ARE COLLABORATING WITH

01:09:06.675 --> 01:09:08.878
EMPLOYERS, CITIES, HARBOR

01:09:08.944 --> 01:09:10.012
DEPARTMENTS AND OTHER

01:09:10.079 --> 01:09:11.113
STAKEHOLDERS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:15.084
AT THE PORTS. I WANT TO BRING UP

01:09:15.150 --> 01:09:15.751
ONE TERMINAL AT THE PORTS CALLED

01:09:15.818 --> 01:09:17.820
CHINA SHIPPING, CHINA SHIPPING.

01:09:17.887 --> 01:09:20.055
IT'S A TERMINAL HAS BEEN

01:09:20.122 --> 01:09:22.758
LITIGATED FOR YEARS. THERE IS,

01:09:22.825 --> 01:09:24.660
I'M GOING TO SAY, SOME

01:09:24.727 --> 01:09:27.696
ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS, ONE 100%

01:09:27.763 --> 01:09:29.265
ZERO EMISSION EQUIPMENT AT THAT

01:09:29.331 --> 01:09:30.799
TERMINAL. IT'S NOT EVEN

01:09:30.866 --> 01:09:32.701
FEASIBLE. IT'S NOT POSSIBLE FOR

01:09:32.768 --> 01:09:34.336
US TO EVEN GET THERE. BUT

01:09:34.403 --> 01:09:35.871
THEY'RE NOT WILLING TO

01:09:35.938 --> 01:09:38.007
NEGOTIATE. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

01:09:38.073 --> 01:09:39.909
THAT MEANS THAT WE'RE IN A HARD

01:09:39.975 --> 01:09:41.710
PLACE WHERE THE TERMINAL HAS TO

01:09:41.777 --> 01:09:42.978
DECIDE WHETHER THEY CLOSE. DO

01:09:43.045 --> 01:09:45.180
THEY LIMIT OPERATIONS TO COMPLY

01:09:45.247 --> 01:09:47.449
WITH COURT DECISIONS? SO THAT

01:09:47.516 --> 01:09:49.518
PUTS OUR WORKERS IN IN THE

01:09:49.585 --> 01:09:51.654
MIDDLE OF THIS CONFLICT, AS THE

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:53.756
SENATOR MENTIONED, WE UNDER THE

01:09:53.822 --> 01:09:55.991
CLEAN AIR ACTION PLAN ARE OUR

01:09:56.058 --> 01:09:57.159
COLLECTIVE EFFORTS HAVE RESULTED

01:09:57.226 --> 01:09:59.428
IN MANY ACCOMPLISHMENTS TO CLEAN

01:09:59.495 --> 01:10:02.898
THE AIR. ONE ONE EXAMPLE AND ONE

01:10:02.965 --> 01:10:04.466
POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT

01:10:04.533 --> 01:10:05.901
DURING COVID, WHEN WE ALL STAYED

01:10:05.968 --> 01:10:07.503
HOME AND THE ILWU CONTINUE TO

01:10:07.570 --> 01:10:10.039
MOVE GOODS FOR EVERYBODY TO STAY

01:10:10.105 --> 01:10:12.975
HOME, AND WHETHER THAT WAS FOR

01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:14.343
WHAT WAS EQUIPMENT, YOU KNOW,

01:10:14.410 --> 01:10:16.512
YOUR COUCH, WHETHER IT WAS YOUR

01:10:16.579 --> 01:10:18.147
MASKS, ANYTHING THAT YOU NEEDED.

01:10:18.213 --> 01:10:20.482
WE LOST MANY MEMBERS DURING THAT

01:10:20.549 --> 01:10:21.984
PANDEMIC. AND WHAT YOU COULD SEE

01:10:22.051 --> 01:10:24.086
WAS THE SAN GABRIEL MOUNTAINS,

01:10:24.153 --> 01:10:26.589
BECAUSE ALL THE OTHER POLLUTION

01:10:26.655 --> 01:10:28.390
FACTORS WERE NOT AT PLAY. THE

01:10:28.457 --> 01:10:30.893
PORTS WERE ARE NOT THE CAUSE OF

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:32.027
ALL THAT POLLUTION. SO I JUST

01:10:32.094 --> 01:10:34.229
WANT TO MAKE THAT POINT WHILE WE

01:10:34.296 --> 01:10:36.332
ARE CONTINUING TO COLLECTIVELY

01:10:36.398 --> 01:10:37.733
IMPLEMENT NUMEROUS NEW

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:38.634
REGULATIONS FROM THE CALIFORNIA

01:10:38.701 --> 01:10:42.037
AIR RESOURCES BOARD, WE HAVE

01:10:42.104 --> 01:10:44.239
GOALS. AND ONE OTHER EXAMPLE IS

01:10:44.306 --> 01:10:47.076
THE PORT. WE'RE AT TWO 3230.

01:10:47.142 --> 01:10:48.377
OKAY, CAN I GET ANOTHER MINUTE

01:10:48.444 --> 01:10:50.479
SINCE I'M THE SECOND ONE? OKAY.

01:10:50.546 --> 01:10:52.414
SO I'LL MAKE IT QUICK. SO A

01:10:52.481 --> 01:10:53.749
QUICK ONE. YEAH. THE GOVERNOR'S

01:10:53.816 --> 01:10:56.819
OFFICE CALLED THE ILWU SAYING

01:10:56.885 --> 01:10:58.621
WHETHER WE WERE OKAY WITH

01:10:58.687 --> 01:11:00.122
IMPLEMENTING A NEAR ZERO

01:11:00.189 --> 01:11:01.924
EMISSION BY 2030 AND ZERO

01:11:01.991 --> 01:11:03.993
EMISSION BY 2035. THAT SAID, WE

01:11:04.059 --> 01:11:05.594
WERE OKAY WITH THAT BECAUSE WE

01:11:05.661 --> 01:11:07.596
WANT CLEAN AIR. WITH THAT, WE

01:11:07.663 --> 01:11:09.932
WANT JOBS. I DIDN'T STICK TO MY

01:11:09.999 --> 01:11:11.900
SCRIPT, BUT WE NEED A BALANCED

01:11:11.967 --> 01:11:13.569
APPROACH FROM LEGISLATORS, AND

01:11:13.636 --> 01:11:15.270
THAT IS TO PROTECT JOBS,

01:11:15.337 --> 01:11:16.939
BUSINESS AND OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:11:17.006 --> 01:11:19.375
WE'RE NOT SAYING NO TO CLEAN

01:11:19.441 --> 01:11:21.076
AIR. WE'RE JUST ASKING FOR A

01:11:21.143 --> 01:11:22.511
BALANCED APPROACH. THANK YOU.

01:11:22.578 --> 01:11:24.380

TAYLOR THOMAS. I'M WITH ESTARÃ

01:13:15.691 --> 01:13:17.025
COMMUNITIES FROM RAMONA JUSTICE

01:13:17.092 --> 01:13:18.727
AND THE IMPACT PROJECT. AND I'D

01:13:18.794 --> 01:13:19.695
ALSO LIKE TO SAY WE'RE A

01:13:19.762 --> 01:13:21.830
LITIGANT IN THE CHINESE SHIPPING

01:13:21.897 --> 01:13:22.664
CASE, AND WE'RE IN LITIGATION

01:13:22.731 --> 01:13:23.999
BECAUSE THEY VIOLATED A COURT

01:13:24.066 --> 01:13:25.868
ORDER, NOT BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU

01:13:25.934 --> 01:13:27.302
SHARED. BUT THANK YOU FOR

01:13:27.369 --> 01:13:28.370
SHARING THAT. ANYWAY, SO IN THE

TWO MINUTES THAT I HAVE TO

01:13:29.705 --> 01:13:31.607
CONVINCE YOU TO VOTE DOWN THIS

01:13:31.673 --> 01:13:32.841
BILL, I'M HERE TO ALSO UPLIFT

01:13:32.908 --> 01:13:33.842
THAT THIS BILL NOT ONLY

01:13:33.909 --> 01:13:35.911
UNDERMINES ALMOST A DECADE OF

01:13:35.978 --> 01:13:37.346
COMMUNITY INPUT, BUT ALSO SETS A

01:13:37.412 --> 01:13:39.548
BAD PRECEDENT THAT POLLUTERS CAN

01:13:39.615 --> 01:13:40.949
FOREGO THE PUBLIC PROCESS AND

01:13:41.016 --> 01:13:42.785
USE LEGISLATION TO GET WHAT THEY

01:13:42.851 --> 01:13:45.454
WANT. THIS BILL IS NOT GOOD

01:13:45.521 --> 01:13:46.889
GOVERNANCE. THE FIRST TIME THE

01:13:46.955 --> 01:13:47.990
AUTHOR OF THIS BILL HAS ENGAGED

01:13:48.056 --> 01:13:49.625
ON THE PORTS INDIRECT SOURCE

01:13:49.691 --> 01:13:50.692
RULE PUBLICLY IS THROUGH THIS

01:13:50.759 --> 01:13:52.294
BILL, NOT THE COUNTLESS WORKING

01:13:52.361 --> 01:13:53.862
GROUP MEETINGS, COMMUNITY

01:13:53.929 --> 01:13:55.364
MEETINGS, OR BOARD MEETINGS THAT

01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:57.499
HAVE TAKEN PLACE. THERE'S BEEN

01:13:57.566 --> 01:13:58.967
OUTSPOKEN CRITICISM FROM SOME OF

01:13:59.034 --> 01:14:00.702
YOU AGAINST THE FEDERAL

01:14:00.769 --> 01:14:02.237
GOVERNMENT FOR ITS IMPOSITION ON

01:14:02.304 --> 01:14:04.406
LOCAL AUTHORITIES REGARDING

01:14:04.473 --> 01:14:05.707
IMMIGRATION. AND YET, HERE WE

01:14:05.774 --> 01:14:08.010
ARE CONSIDERING OVERRIDING LOCAL

01:14:08.076 --> 01:14:09.812
AUTHORITY IN THE FACE OF MASS

01:14:09.878 --> 01:14:11.213
ENVIRONMENTAL DEREGULATION AND

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:13.215
AN ONGOING PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS

01:14:13.282 --> 01:14:15.217
IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THERE'S MANY

01:14:15.284 --> 01:14:17.085
OF US THAT CAME UP TODAY FROM

01:14:17.152 --> 01:14:18.353
THE SOUTH COAST, AND WE'RE JUST

01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:20.189
A SMALL REPRESENTATION OF THE

01:14:20.255 --> 01:14:21.490
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:14:21.557 --> 01:14:23.458
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY

01:14:23.525 --> 01:14:25.260
NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY PORT

01:14:25.327 --> 01:14:26.562
OPERATIONS, THAT DON'T HAVE THE

01:14:26.628 --> 01:14:28.764
ABILITY TO TELL YOU THE HARM

01:14:28.831 --> 01:14:30.632
ABOUT THEY EXPERIENCE EVERY DAY.

01:14:30.699 --> 01:14:33.135
THE CHILDREN STATIONED WITH

01:14:33.202 --> 01:14:34.536
ASTHMA INHALERS AT THEIR

01:14:34.603 --> 01:14:37.172
SCHOOLS, LIKE I WAS THE ELDERS

01:14:37.239 --> 01:14:38.874
CARRYING OXYGEN TANKS, OR THE

01:14:38.941 --> 01:14:40.742
PREGNANT WOMEN WHO HAVE DIESEL

01:14:40.809 --> 01:14:42.177
PARTICULATE MATTER IN THEIR

01:14:42.244 --> 01:14:45.113
AMNIOTIC FLUID. SO IN ADDITION

01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:46.181
TO DEMANDING A NO VOTE ON THIS

01:14:46.248 --> 01:14:48.317
BILL, I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS. WHY

01:14:48.383 --> 01:14:49.885
DO YOU GOVERN AND WHO DO YOU

01:14:49.952 --> 01:14:52.287
GOVERN FOR? BECAUSE EVERY YES,

01:14:52.354 --> 01:14:54.456
NO OR ABSTENTION IS A SIGNAL TO

01:14:54.523 --> 01:14:56.859
THE WORLD ABOUT YOUR CHARACTER.

01:14:56.925 --> 01:14:58.660
DESPITE THE YEARS OF CONSISTENT

01:14:58.727 --> 01:15:00.929
LIES AND GASLIGHTING, WE ENDURE

01:15:00.996 --> 01:15:02.998
TO FIGHT FOR OUR HEALTH. WE KEEP

01:15:03.065 --> 01:15:04.867
SHOWING UP AND ENGAGING BECAUSE

01:15:04.933 --> 01:15:06.201
WE'RE ROOTED IN TRUTH AND

01:15:06.268 --> 01:15:08.270
REASON, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,

01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:10.572
LOVE AND COMPASSION. AND WE

01:15:10.639 --> 01:15:13.475
HOPE. I HOPE THAT YOU HAVE LOVE

WE'RE OPPOSED TO SB 34. AND

01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:36.131
WHILE I APPRECIATE THE

01:15:36.198 --> 01:15:38.000
COMMITTEE'S EFFORTS TO AMEND SB

01:15:38.066 --> 01:15:40.235
34 TO BE LESS HARMFUL, THE BILL

01:15:40.302 --> 01:15:41.603
STILL POSES GREAT RISKS TO

01:15:41.670 --> 01:15:43.238
PUBLIC HEALTH AND POTENTIALLY

01:15:43.305 --> 01:15:46.642
THE OVERALL ECONOMY. SB 34 SETS

01:15:46.708 --> 01:15:48.477
A TERRIBLE PRECEDENT TO ALLOW A

01:15:48.543 --> 01:15:50.846
SPECIFIC INDUSTRY TO RUN A BILL

01:15:50.913 --> 01:15:52.814
ANY TIME THERE IS POTENTIAL FOR

01:15:52.881 --> 01:15:54.483
REGULATION WITHOUT REGARD TO THE

01:15:54.549 --> 01:15:55.784
IMPACTS ON THE LARGER ECONOMY

01:15:55.851 --> 01:15:59.187

01:15:59.254 --> 01:16:00.622
DISREGARDS OVER EIGHT YEARS OF

01:16:00.689 --> 01:16:02.324

HAS ENGAGED ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN

01:16:14.169 --> 01:16:16.471
GOOD FAITH TO DEVELOP A PATH

01:16:16.538 --> 01:16:18.640
FORWARD. AND LET ME BE CLEAR,

01:16:18.707 --> 01:16:21.076
SOUTH COAST AQMD IS NOT AND WILL

01:16:21.143 --> 01:16:23.345
NOT IMPOSE A CAP ON CARGO

01:16:23.412 --> 01:16:25.480
THROUGHPUT. WE RECOGNIZE THE

01:16:25.547 --> 01:16:27.249
PORTS ARE VITAL TO THE REGIONAL,

01:16:27.316 --> 01:16:28.717
STATE AND NATIONAL ECONOMY, AND

01:16:28.784 --> 01:16:30.919
WE'RE FOCUSED ON ENABLING

01:16:30.986 --> 01:16:33.455

ENVIRONMENT. AND TOWARD THAT

01:16:42.731 --> 01:16:45.667
END, WE'VE ALREADY INVESTED OVER

01:16:45.734 --> 01:16:47.502
$750 MILLION IN THE PORTS FOR

01:16:47.569 --> 01:16:49.571
CLEAN TECHNOLOGY OVER THE LAST

01:16:49.638 --> 01:16:51.340
TEN YEARS. AND WE KNOW THESE

01:16:51.406 --> 01:16:53.208
INVESTMENTS ARE IMPORTANT. AS

01:16:53.275 --> 01:16:55.711
THE SAN PEDRO BAY PORT COMPLEX

01:16:55.777 --> 01:16:57.679
IS THE LARGEST SINGLE SOURCE OF

01:16:57.746 --> 01:16:59.614
AIR POLLUTION IN THE STATE OF

01:16:59.681 --> 01:17:01.383
CALIFORNIA, IT'S TIME FOR THE

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:02.784
PORTS TO DO THEIR FAIR SHARE,

01:17:02.851 --> 01:17:05.721
AND IF PASSED, SB 34 WOULD SHIFT

01:17:05.787 --> 01:17:07.222
THE EMISSION BURDENS TO

01:17:07.289 --> 01:17:09.024
STATIONARY SOURCES WHILE LETTING

01:17:09.091 --> 01:17:11.226
THE BIGGEST POLLUTER OFF THE

01:17:11.293 --> 01:17:12.995
HOOK. IT POTENTIALLY COST THE

01:17:13.061 --> 01:17:14.863
STATE TENS, IF NOT HUNDREDS OF

01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:16.598
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PUBLIC

01:17:16.665 --> 01:17:18.033

IF YOU HAD A CHANCE TO READ IT,

01:21:13.034 --> 01:21:16.004
MISS RICHARDSON. IT'S TITLED SB

01:21:16.071 --> 01:21:17.706
34 IS A DEATH SENTENCE FOR OUR

01:21:17.772 --> 01:21:20.275
COMMUNITIES. SAYS THREE PEOPLE

01:21:20.342 --> 01:21:22.811
EACH DAY DIE EACH DAY IN THIS

01:21:22.877 --> 01:21:24.045
REGION FROM AIR POLLUTION. IT'S

01:21:24.112 --> 01:21:25.780
NOT CAR CRASHES, NOT GUN

01:21:25.847 --> 01:21:27.215
VIOLENCE. IT'S AIR. AND THAT IS

01:21:27.282 --> 01:21:29.017
THE PRICE WE PAY FOR LIVING NEAR

01:21:29.084 --> 01:21:30.385
THESE PORTS AND WAREHOUSES, OUR

01:21:30.452 --> 01:21:31.820

01:21:31.886 --> 01:21:33.989

01:21:34.055 --> 01:21:35.490
SO MR. GOLDEN, I BELIEVE, IS

01:21:35.557 --> 01:21:38.460
HERE TODAY, DETAILS HOW WE'VE

01:21:38.526 --> 01:21:40.895
BEEN LOOKING FOR THAT BALANCED

01:21:40.962 --> 01:21:43.131
APPROACH, THAT SOLUTION BETWEEN

01:21:43.198 --> 01:21:45.600
THE PORTS, THE AIR DISTRICT TO

01:21:45.667 --> 01:21:47.235
MAKE SURE WE PROTECT OUR

01:21:47.302 --> 01:21:49.804

01:21:49.871 --> 01:21:51.973
YEARS AND NOTHING HAS HAPPENED.

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:54.175
NOTHING. AND SO I KNOW THAT THE

01:21:54.242 --> 01:21:56.711
ORIGINAL BILL HERE ASKED FOR AN

01:21:56.778 --> 01:21:59.147
EXEMPTION FOR NOTHING TO HAPPEN

01:21:59.214 --> 01:22:03.551

AND I SHARE THE SENTIMENT, HE

01:22:05.053 --> 01:22:06.454
SAID. THE MOST INFURIATING PART

01:22:06.521 --> 01:22:07.789
IS THAT THIS THE TYPE OF

01:22:07.856 --> 01:22:09.391
BEHAVIOR I WOULD EXPECT FROM

01:22:09.457 --> 01:22:11.493
TRUMP, NOT CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATS.

01:22:11.559 --> 01:22:13.061
TRUMP AND HIS PEOPLE IN CONGRESS

01:22:13.128 --> 01:22:14.329
HAVE ALREADY TAKEN AWAY THE BEST

01:22:14.396 --> 01:22:16.498
CLEAN AIR LAWS THAT WE HAD ON

01:22:16.564 --> 01:22:17.899
THE BOOKS. NOW, OUR OWN STATE

01:22:17.966 --> 01:22:19.401
LEGISLATURE WANTS TO STRIP AWAY

01:22:19.467 --> 01:22:21.236
THE LITTLE CONTROL LOCAL CONTROL

01:22:21.303 --> 01:22:23.004
WE HAVE BY TRYING TO SHUT DOWN

01:22:23.071 --> 01:22:24.906
THE COMMUNITIES FIGHTING BACK.

01:22:24.973 --> 01:22:26.541
IF YOU VOTE FOR SB 34, YOU'RE

01:22:26.608 --> 01:22:27.976
VOTING TO LET POLLUTION CONTINUE

01:22:28.043 --> 01:22:29.744
TO KILL PEOPLE. IN MY

01:22:29.811 --> 01:22:30.912
NEIGHBORHOOD, YOU'RE VOTING TO

01:22:30.979 --> 01:22:32.781
SILENCE THE VOICES OF THE PEOPLE

01:22:32.847 --> 01:22:35.150
MOST IMPACTED. YOU ARE VOTING TO

01:22:35.216 --> 01:22:37.585
IMPOSE SLOW, QUIET, DEATH DEATH

01:22:37.652 --> 01:22:39.220
SENTENCE ON BLACK, BROWN, AND

01:22:39.287 --> 01:22:40.355
WORKING CLASS FAMILIES ACROSS

01:22:40.422 --> 01:22:43.091
THE REGION. SO I APPRECIATE MR.

01:22:43.158 --> 01:22:44.592
GOLDEN AND HIS PIECE. I THOUGHT

01:22:44.659 --> 01:22:46.628
IT WAS REALLY IMPACTFUL. WHAT I

01:22:46.695 --> 01:22:48.697
HEARD TODAY IN THE TESTIMONY IS

01:22:48.763 --> 01:22:49.597
JUST BASICALLY CITING ALL THE

01:22:49.664 --> 01:22:51.399
DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT ARE OUT

01:22:51.466 --> 01:22:54.135
OF YOUR CONTROL. IT TOOK ME BACK

01:22:54.202 --> 01:22:55.737
TO SCHOOL DAYS WHERE WE BLAME

01:22:55.804 --> 01:22:57.238
THE PARENTS. WE BLAME STUDENTS

01:22:57.305 --> 01:22:58.473
NOT DOING THEIR HOMEWORK. WE

01:22:58.540 --> 01:22:59.841
BLAME THEIR PREVIOUS GRADE

01:22:59.908 --> 01:23:02.110
TEACHER. EVERYBODY EXCEPT THE

01:23:02.177 --> 01:23:06.481
PERSON RESPONSIBLE. AND IT'S

01:23:06.548 --> 01:23:12.687
BEEN TEN YEARS. I WILL NOT BE

01:23:12.754 --> 01:23:13.621
SUPPORTING YOUR MEASURE, MR.

01:23:13.688 --> 01:23:17.959
RICHARDSON. THANK YOU, MR.

01:23:18.026 --> 01:23:19.928
GARCIA. OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS,

01:23:19.994 --> 01:23:24.299
MR. MURATSUCHI. THANK YOU VERY

01:23:24.366 --> 01:23:27.302
MUCH. AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE

01:23:27.369 --> 01:23:30.138
SOUTH BAY AND HARBOR AREA,

01:23:30.205 --> 01:23:38.513
INCLUDING HALF OF SAN PEDRO, I.

01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:41.349
RECOGNIZE AND APPRECIATE MANY OF

01:23:41.416 --> 01:23:44.319
THE ISSUES BEING PRESENTED IN

01:23:44.386 --> 01:23:48.623
THIS BILL. FIRST OF ALL, I, I DO

01:23:48.690 --> 01:23:52.794
WANT TO, YOU KNOW, RECOGNIZE

01:23:52.861 --> 01:23:55.296
THAT THE PORTS OF LA AND LONG

01:23:55.363 --> 01:23:57.932
BEACH, THEY ACCOUNT FOR 40% OF

01:23:57.999 --> 01:24:01.236
ALL IMPORTS AND EXPORTS IN THE

01:24:01.302 --> 01:24:02.637
ENTIRE STATE, UNITED STATES OF

01:24:02.704 --> 01:24:06.174
AMERICA. IT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST

01:24:06.241 --> 01:24:10.245
ECONOMIC ENGINES, NOT ONLY FOR

01:24:10.311 --> 01:24:12.046
THE AREA, BUT FOR OUR ENTIRE

01:24:12.113 --> 01:24:14.115
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT IS THE

01:24:14.182 --> 01:24:16.317
BIGGEST PORT COMPLEX IN THE

01:24:16.384 --> 01:24:20.388
ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ONE

01:24:20.455 --> 01:24:22.590
OF MY BIGGEST CONCERNS. WELL,

01:24:22.657 --> 01:24:27.829
LET ME LET ME SAY THAT I, YOU

01:24:27.896 --> 01:24:29.898
KNOW, BEEN A LONG TIME SUPPORTER

01:24:29.964 --> 01:24:31.433
OF THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY

01:24:31.499 --> 01:24:33.635
MANAGEMENT DISTRICT AND ALL THE

01:24:33.701 --> 01:24:36.271
GREAT WORK THAT YOU DO TO

01:24:36.337 --> 01:24:38.173
PROTECT, YOU KNOW, OUR, OUR

01:24:38.239 --> 01:24:40.141
COMMUNITIES IN SOUTHERN

01:24:40.208 --> 01:24:45.079
CALIFORNIA. I KNOW WE HAD WORKED

01:24:45.146 --> 01:24:47.582
TOGETHER TO ADDRESS MANY OF THE

01:24:47.649 --> 01:24:49.384
ISSUES COMING OUT OF THE

01:24:49.451 --> 01:24:51.686
TORRANCE REFINERY, AND I TRULY

01:24:51.753 --> 01:24:53.755
APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT THE

01:24:53.822 --> 01:24:56.291
AQMD DOES. HAVING SAID THAT, I

01:24:56.357 --> 01:25:00.161
ONE OF MY BIG CONCERNS IS WITH

01:25:00.228 --> 01:25:04.532
THE OBJECTIVES OF THE CLEAN AIR

01:25:04.599 --> 01:25:09.537
ACTION PLAN WITH ITS UPDATES

01:25:09.604 --> 01:25:11.372
INCLUDING GOALS OF ACHIEVING

01:25:11.439 --> 01:25:13.942
100% ZERO EMISSIONS OPERATIONS

01:25:14.008 --> 01:25:15.844
FOR CARGO HANDLING EQUIPMENT BY

01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:21.816
2030 AND FOR TRUCKS BY 2035. BUT

01:25:21.883 --> 01:25:25.320
MY ONGOING CONCERNS HAVE BEEN

01:25:25.386 --> 01:25:29.090
THE LOSS OF COMPETITIVENESS FOR

01:25:29.157 --> 01:25:30.291
OUR PORTS OF LOS ANGELES AND

01:25:30.358 --> 01:25:33.661
LONG BEACH. AND, YOU KNOW,

01:25:33.728 --> 01:25:35.797
SIMILAR TO CONVERSATIONS THAT

01:25:35.864 --> 01:25:39.834
WE'RE HAVING ABOUT ABOUT

01:25:39.901 --> 01:25:40.902
REFINERIES SHUTTING DOWN IN THE

01:25:40.969 --> 01:25:42.971
STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND, AND US

01:25:43.037 --> 01:25:44.105
AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:25:44.172 --> 01:25:48.743
HAVING TO IMPORT. REFINED GAS

01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:52.046
FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES, WHICH

01:25:52.113 --> 01:25:54.148
MUCH WITH MUCH LOWER

01:25:54.215 --> 01:25:56.251
ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS. I'M

01:25:56.317 --> 01:26:01.289
CONCERNED THAT WE. YOU KNOW, IN

01:26:01.356 --> 01:26:05.627
OUR WELL, YOU KNOW, INTENTIONED

01:26:05.693 --> 01:26:07.996
EFFORTS TO CUT DOWN ON AIR

01:26:08.062 --> 01:26:11.399
POLLUTION IN THE HARBOR AREA

01:26:11.466 --> 01:26:12.967
AND, YOU KNOW, AND THE LARGER

01:26:13.034 --> 01:26:15.069
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AREA THAT WE

01:26:15.136 --> 01:26:20.808
ARE HANDICAPPING OUR PORTS AND

01:26:20.875 --> 01:26:24.012
RISKING LOSING CONTAINER VOLUME.

01:26:24.078 --> 01:26:28.383
THAT IS THE BIG ECONOMIC DRIVER.

01:26:28.449 --> 01:26:30.818
YOU KNOW, I RESPECT THE PASSION

01:26:30.885 --> 01:26:32.787
OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM RANCHO

01:26:32.854 --> 01:26:36.291
CUCAMONGA, AND I KNOW THAT HE'S

01:26:36.357 --> 01:26:39.027
A FIGHTER FOR HIS COMMUNITIES

01:26:39.093 --> 01:26:40.695
AND FOR THE AIR POLLUTION. BUT I

01:26:40.762 --> 01:26:42.130
HAVE TO RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE

01:26:42.196 --> 01:26:43.998
THAT NOTHING'S BEEN DONE. I

01:26:44.065 --> 01:26:46.701
MEAN, WHEN, AS THE EARLIER

01:26:46.768 --> 01:26:50.805
PRESENTATION CITED, THAT THERE

01:26:50.872 --> 01:26:53.942
HAVE BEEN DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENTS

01:26:54.008 --> 01:26:57.178
IN TERMS OF EMISSION REDUCTIONS.

01:26:57.245 --> 01:27:01.749
I GUESS MY QUESTION FOR THE AQMD

01:27:01.816 --> 01:27:05.820
IS, I MEAN, WHAT IS YOUR

01:27:05.887 --> 01:27:09.057
ANALYSIS IN TERMS OF, YOU KNOW,

01:27:09.123 --> 01:27:11.826
HOW DOES THE AQMD TAKE INTO

01:27:11.893 --> 01:27:13.394
CONSIDERATION WHETHER THE

01:27:13.461 --> 01:27:16.931
EFFORTS TO CLEAN UP THE REGIONAL

01:27:16.998 --> 01:27:21.669
AIR POLLUTION, HOW THAT IMPACTS

01:27:21.736 --> 01:27:24.973
THE, THE, THE, THE

01:27:25.039 --> 01:27:25.607
COMPETITIVENESS OF THE PORTS OF

01:27:25.673 --> 01:27:27.842
LOS ANGELES AND LONG BEACH?

01:27:27.909 --> 01:27:29.611
WELL, I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT

01:27:29.677 --> 01:27:30.979
WHAT'S HAPPENED OVER THE LAST

01:27:31.045 --> 01:27:32.513
SEVERAL YEARS, THE PORT HAS

01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:35.383
CLEANED UP TREMENDOUSLY. AND AT

01:27:35.450 --> 01:27:37.018
THE SAME TIME, THE PORT HAS

01:27:37.085 --> 01:27:39.287
INCREASED ITS THROUGHPUT ON

01:27:39.354 --> 01:27:41.222
CONTAINER TRAFFIC. AND WHILE YOU

01:27:41.289 --> 01:27:42.991
MAY HEAR ARGUMENTS THAT THE

01:27:43.057 --> 01:27:45.426
MARKET SHARE HAS BEEN DECLINING,

01:27:45.493 --> 01:27:47.061
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THROUGHPUT

01:27:47.128 --> 01:27:48.997
THROUGH THE PANDEMIC. AND EVEN

01:27:49.063 --> 01:27:50.431
RECENTLY, THERE WERE RECORD HIGH

01:27:50.498 --> 01:27:52.600
NUMBER OF THROUGHPUT. SO THE

01:27:52.667 --> 01:27:55.103
PORT CONTINUES TO GROW. THE PORT

01:27:55.169 --> 01:27:57.238
CONTINUES TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN

01:27:57.305 --> 01:27:59.774
CLEAN AIR TECHNOLOGY. WE

01:27:59.841 --> 01:28:01.809
RECENTLY RECEIVED A $500 MILLION

01:28:01.876 --> 01:28:04.112
GRANT FROM US EPA THAT'S

01:28:04.178 --> 01:28:05.947
DEDICATED TO LOOKING AT GOODS

01:28:06.014 --> 01:28:07.448
MOVEMENT. A GOOD PORTION OF THAT

01:28:07.515 --> 01:28:09.617
WILL LOOK AT THE PORTS AND THE

01:28:09.684 --> 01:28:10.985
GOODS MOVEMENT ASSOCIATED

01:28:11.052 --> 01:28:12.353
THROUGHOUT, NOT JUST THE PORTS,

01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:13.688
BUT ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE

01:28:13.755 --> 01:28:16.691
BORDER OF CALIFORNIA. AND SO, AS

01:28:16.758 --> 01:28:18.626
I SAID BEFORE, WE'VE INVESTED

01:28:18.693 --> 01:28:20.762
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:28:20.828 --> 01:28:22.330
SO THAT THE PORTS CAN DEPLOY

01:28:22.397 --> 01:28:24.666
THAT CLEANER TECHNOLOGY. AND IN

01:28:24.732 --> 01:28:25.833
FACT, WHEN YOU LOOK AT LONG

01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:27.435
BEACH CONTAINER TERMINAL, WHICH

01:28:27.502 --> 01:28:29.437
IS THE NATION'S FIRST ZERO

01:28:29.504 --> 01:28:31.539
EMISSIONS PORT, THEY FOUND THAT

01:28:31.606 --> 01:28:34.709
THEIR THROUGHPUT HAS MORE THAN

01:28:34.776 --> 01:28:36.978
DOUBLED. THEY'RE RUNNING THREE

01:28:37.045 --> 01:28:40.081
SHIFTS, AND THEY'RE TREMENDOUSLY

01:28:40.148 --> 01:28:41.849
PRODUCTIVE IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC

01:28:41.916 --> 01:28:43.384
GROWTH. AND THAT'S WHY I SAID

01:28:43.451 --> 01:28:45.687
YOU CAN SEE STRONG GROWTH AND

01:28:45.753 --> 01:28:47.321
YOU CAN SEE STRONG INVESTMENTS

01:28:47.388 --> 01:28:49.891
IN THE ENVIRONMENT. WHAT WE'RE

01:28:49.957 --> 01:28:51.092
ASKING, AS WE'RE GOING THROUGH

01:28:51.159 --> 01:28:53.194
OUR RULEMAKING PROCESS, IS FOR

01:28:53.261 --> 01:28:56.364
THE PORTS TO PUT MORE DETAIL TO

01:28:56.431 --> 01:28:58.566
THAT CLEAN AIR ACTION PLAN AND

01:28:58.633 --> 01:29:00.201
TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. AS

01:29:00.268 --> 01:29:02.036
REGIONAL ADMINISTRATOR OF US

01:29:02.103 --> 01:29:04.005
EPA, A POSITION THAT I HELD FOR

01:29:04.072 --> 01:29:06.040
OVER SEVEN YEARS, I WORKED ON

01:29:06.107 --> 01:29:09.977
THAT FORCE THAT FIRST PORT PLAN.

01:29:10.044 --> 01:29:11.579
AND YES, WHILE THERE HAVE BEEN

01:29:11.646 --> 01:29:13.247
TREMENDOUS REDUCTIONS SINCE THAT

01:29:13.314 --> 01:29:15.416
TIME, WE STILL NEED A TREMENDOUS

01:29:15.483 --> 01:29:17.585
AMOUNT MORE OF EMISSION

01:29:17.652 --> 01:29:19.487
REDUCTIONS FOR THAT. AND THE NEW

01:29:19.554 --> 01:29:20.888
TECHNOLOGY THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:29:20.955 --> 01:29:23.191
WILL HELP US GET THERE. THERE

01:29:23.257 --> 01:29:24.158
ARE SOME TECHNOLOGIES WHICH WE

01:29:24.225 --> 01:29:25.560
UNDERSTAND ARE NOT READY FOR

01:29:25.626 --> 01:29:27.395
PRIME TIME, BUT LET'S GET

01:29:27.462 --> 01:29:28.863
TOGETHER. LET'S PLAN HOW THAT'S

01:29:28.930 --> 01:29:30.631
GOING TO WORK OUT. LADWP IS NOT

01:29:30.698 --> 01:29:32.300
THE ONLY UTILITY INVOLVED IN

01:29:32.366 --> 01:29:34.168
THIS. WE ALSO HAVE SOCAL,

01:29:34.235 --> 01:29:37.338
EDISON, ALL OF THESE PEOPLE AND

01:29:37.405 --> 01:29:39.607
PARTIES AND STAKEHOLDERS AND

01:29:39.674 --> 01:29:41.743
COMMUNITY MEMBERS HAVE BEEN

01:29:41.809 --> 01:29:42.810
MEETING. AS TAYLOR MENTIONED,

01:29:42.877 --> 01:29:44.212
WE'VE BEEN HAVING WORKGROUP

01:29:44.278 --> 01:29:45.279
MEETINGS. WE'VE BEEN HAVING

01:29:45.346 --> 01:29:47.448
COMMUNITY MEETINGS. WE CONTINUE

01:29:47.515 --> 01:29:49.717
TO DO THAT. WE'RE HOPEFUL TO

01:29:49.784 --> 01:29:52.220
BRING A RULE TO OUR BOARD FOR

01:29:52.286 --> 01:29:54.722
CONSIDERATION IN OCTOBER. AND

01:29:54.789 --> 01:29:55.289
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE

01:29:55.356 --> 01:29:56.791
TRYING TO DO, IS TO MAKE SURE

01:29:56.858 --> 01:29:58.659
THAT WE ADDRESS THE ECONOMIC

01:29:58.726 --> 01:30:00.428
IMPACTS. AND THAT IS ONE OF THE

01:30:00.495 --> 01:30:01.629
REQUIREMENTS THAT WE ACTUALLY

01:30:01.696 --> 01:30:03.297
HAVE TO GO THROUGH IS WE HAVE TO

01:30:03.364 --> 01:30:05.466
DO THAT SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACT.

01:30:05.533 --> 01:30:06.834
AND AGAIN, I WANT TO STRESS THE

01:30:06.901 --> 01:30:09.203
FACT THAT WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR

01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:10.805
IS GIVE US THE DETAILS OF THE

01:30:10.872 --> 01:30:12.340
PLAN, TELL US HOW YOU'RE GOING

01:30:12.406 --> 01:30:13.508
TO DO IT. TELL US WHAT ARE THE

01:30:13.574 --> 01:30:14.609
FINANCIAL MECHANISMS THAT ARE

01:30:14.675 --> 01:30:16.778
NECESSARY? HOW CAN WE THEN WORK

01:30:16.844 --> 01:30:18.346
TOGETHER TO IDENTIFY THOSE

01:30:18.412 --> 01:30:20.114
MEANS? SO ALL OF THOSE FACTORS,

01:30:20.181 --> 01:30:21.749
I HOPE I ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION

01:30:21.816 --> 01:30:24.285
IN TERMS OF THE PORT'S ABILITY

01:30:24.352 --> 01:30:25.753
TO CONTINUE TO MAKE

01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:26.821
IMPROVEMENTS, TO CONTINUE TO

01:30:26.888 --> 01:30:28.756
MAKE THOSE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:30:28.823 --> 01:30:29.557
INVESTMENTS, AND MOST

01:30:29.624 --> 01:30:31.092
IMPORTANTLY, TO CONTINUE TO

01:30:31.159 --> 01:30:33.127
IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH IN THE

01:30:33.194 --> 01:30:35.129
SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES. I

01:30:35.196 --> 01:30:38.199
APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSE, BUT I

01:30:38.266 --> 01:30:40.835
KNOW THAT THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN

01:30:40.902 --> 01:30:45.173
HOTLY DEBATED IN THE HARBOR AREA

01:30:45.239 --> 01:30:49.043
FOR YEARS NOW. I REMEMBER I

01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:51.145
THINK IT WAS TWO YEARS AGO THAT

01:30:51.212 --> 01:30:57.351
I WAS A MEMBER OF. THE SELECT

01:30:57.418 --> 01:30:59.487
COMMITTEE ON, ON, ON PORTS,

01:30:59.554 --> 01:31:01.222
CALIFORNIA PORTS, WHERE WE

01:31:01.289 --> 01:31:04.192
CONDUCTED A HEARING IN SAN

01:31:04.258 --> 01:31:07.094
PEDRO. AND I HEARD FROM THE

01:31:07.161 --> 01:31:10.298
LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS A STRONG

01:31:10.364 --> 01:31:11.766
OPPOSITION TO THE INDIRECT

01:31:11.833 --> 01:31:14.635
SOURCE RULE BECAUSE OF THE

01:31:14.702 --> 01:31:18.239
CONCERNS ABOUT LOSING MARKET

01:31:18.306 --> 01:31:21.442
SHARE, LOSING CARGO VOLUME TO

01:31:21.509 --> 01:31:24.278
SAVANNAH, GEORGIA, TO THE OTHER

01:31:24.345 --> 01:31:26.447
PORTS THAT THAT DON'T HAVE THE

01:31:26.514 --> 01:31:28.983
STRONG ENVIRONMENTAL

01:31:29.050 --> 01:31:30.818
COMMITMENTS. ANOTHER ONE OF MY

01:31:30.885 --> 01:31:33.321
CONCERNS IS, YOU KNOW, IF I

01:31:33.387 --> 01:31:35.122
MEAN, I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST

01:31:35.189 --> 01:31:36.591
ADVANTAGES THAT WE HAVE IN THE

01:31:36.657 --> 01:31:38.359
PORT OF LOS ANGELES AND LONG

01:31:38.426 --> 01:31:42.730
BEACH IS THE GEOGRAPHIC

01:31:42.797 --> 01:31:46.267
PROXIMITY TO, YOU KNOW, CHINA IN

01:31:46.334 --> 01:31:49.470
PARTICULAR, WHERE I THINK A

01:31:49.537 --> 01:31:52.073
WHAT, OVER 70% OF THE CARGO

01:31:52.139 --> 01:31:56.344
VOLUME COMES FROM. BUT, YOU

01:31:56.410 --> 01:31:59.614
KNOW, AS OTHER PORTS BECOME MORE

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:03.885
COMPETITIVE WITH LOWER

01:32:03.951 --> 01:32:07.622
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS, THAT

01:32:07.688 --> 01:32:09.023
THAT WE WOULD JUST BE

01:32:09.090 --> 01:32:10.224
CONTRIBUTING TO THE GLOBAL

01:32:10.291 --> 01:32:12.260
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY

01:32:12.326 --> 01:32:14.295
SENDING CONTAINER SHIPS, YOU

01:32:14.362 --> 01:32:16.197
KNOW, PAST THE PORTS OF LOS

01:32:16.264 --> 01:32:18.566
ANGELES AND LONG BEACH TO THE

01:32:18.633 --> 01:32:21.335
OTHER PORTS. DOES THE AQMD TAKE

01:32:21.402 --> 01:32:24.839
INTO CONSIDERATION THE GLOBAL

01:32:24.906 --> 01:32:27.008
IMPACTS OF GREENHOUSE GAS

01:32:27.074 --> 01:32:29.143
EMISSIONS WHEN THE CONTAINER

01:32:29.210 --> 01:32:31.112
SHIPS ARE, YOU KNOW, WOULD BE

01:32:31.178 --> 01:32:32.413
BYPASSING THE PORTS OF LOS

01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:34.649
ANGELES AND LONG BEACH TO GO TO

01:32:34.715 --> 01:32:37.084
OTHER PORTS IN THE COUNTRY. SO

01:32:37.151 --> 01:32:39.320
WE LOOK AT THE GHG EMISSIONS AS

01:32:39.387 --> 01:32:41.455
A FUNCTION OF NOX EMISSIONS AS

01:32:41.522 --> 01:32:43.190
WELL. SO WE HAVE TO CALCULATE

01:32:43.257 --> 01:32:45.426
THE TOTAL IMPACT. AND TO YOUR

01:32:45.493 --> 01:32:47.561
POINT ABOUT POTENTIAL DIVERSION,

01:32:47.628 --> 01:32:48.696
POTENTIAL DIVERSION WOULD

01:32:48.763 --> 01:32:50.498
ACTUALLY INCREASE FUEL

01:32:50.564 --> 01:32:51.532
CONSUMPTION. IT WOULD INCREASE

01:32:51.599 --> 01:32:53.968
GHG, IT WOULD INCREASE NOX. AND

01:32:54.035 --> 01:32:55.536
THERE ARE OTHER REASONS WHY

01:32:55.603 --> 01:32:57.204
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DO

01:32:57.271 --> 01:32:59.473
DIVERSION. AS WE'VE SAID BEFORE

01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:00.708
AND HAS BEEN SAID MANY TIMES,

01:33:00.775 --> 01:33:02.310
THE PORT OF LA LONG BEACH

01:33:02.376 --> 01:33:04.412
COMPLEX IS MUCH MORE EFFICIENT.

01:33:04.478 --> 01:33:07.081
YOU HAVE 17 MILLION, CLOSE TO 17

01:33:07.148 --> 01:33:08.249
MILLION PEOPLE IN THE REGION

01:33:08.316 --> 01:33:09.717
THAT PROVIDES A MARKET LIKE NO

01:33:09.784 --> 01:33:12.086
OTHER. AND THE FACT THAT YOU MAY

01:33:12.153 --> 01:33:14.121
HAVE DIVERSION, I WANT TO POINT

01:33:14.188 --> 01:33:15.957
OUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:33:16.023 --> 01:33:17.458
REALLY DRIVES AND ACTUALLY IT'S

01:33:17.525 --> 01:33:19.026
THE PRIMARY DRIVER, ALTHOUGH YOU

01:33:19.093 --> 01:33:20.227
HAVE THE CALIFORNIA CLEAN AIR

01:33:20.294 --> 01:33:21.495
ACT IS THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR

01:33:21.562 --> 01:33:23.431
ACT. AND UNDER THE FEDERAL CLEAN

01:33:23.497 --> 01:33:26.000
AIR ACT, WE HAVE THE WORST AIR

01:33:26.067 --> 01:33:29.670
QUALITY IN THE NATION. WE ARE IN

01:33:29.737 --> 01:33:31.138
NON-ATTAINMENT. AND IF WE ARE IN

01:33:31.205 --> 01:33:33.741
NON-ATTAINMENT, THE FEDERAL

01:33:33.808 --> 01:33:35.042
GOVERNMENT CAN COME IN AND SAY,

01:33:35.109 --> 01:33:36.877
YOU'RE NON-ATTAINMENT AND WE'RE

01:33:36.944 --> 01:33:39.013
GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO COME

01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:39.580
INTO ATTAINMENT. AND THAT'S

01:33:39.647 --> 01:33:41.115
THROUGH A PROCESS CALLED THE

01:33:41.182 --> 01:33:44.085
FEDERAL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN A

01:33:44.151 --> 01:33:47.521
AND THROUGH A FIPP THEY CAN SAY

01:33:47.588 --> 01:33:49.023
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE DRIVE

01:33:49.090 --> 01:33:50.958
DAYS OR YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE

01:33:51.025 --> 01:33:53.094
EVERY OTHER DAY IS A NO DRIVE

01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:55.296
DAY. WE'RE GOING TO DO CARGO

01:33:55.363 --> 01:33:57.331
DIVERSION. THE TRUTH OF THE

01:33:57.398 --> 01:33:59.967
MATTER IS THIS ADMINISTRATION IS

01:34:00.034 --> 01:34:02.470
LOOKING FOR ANY OPPORTUNITY TO

01:34:02.536 --> 01:34:04.638
SHOW CALIFORNIA THAT EVEN THOUGH

01:34:04.705 --> 01:34:06.540
IT HAS THESE GREAT ENVIRONMENTAL

01:34:06.607 --> 01:34:08.175
ASPIRATIONS, IT CAN'T COME INTO

01:34:08.242 --> 01:34:10.277
COMPLIANCE. AND SO WHEN YOU TALK

01:34:10.344 --> 01:34:11.746
ABOUT WHERE IS THE REAL

01:34:11.812 --> 01:34:13.247
OPPORTUNITY FOR DIVERSION, IT'S

01:34:13.314 --> 01:34:15.816
NOT FROM THE SOUTH COAST AQMD,

01:34:15.883 --> 01:34:16.751
IT'S FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:34:16.817 --> 01:34:18.686
AND THE SOUTH COAST. AQMD IS

01:34:18.753 --> 01:34:20.921
DOING EVERYTHING IT CAN TO STOP

01:34:20.988 --> 01:34:22.923
THE DIVERSION, TO KEEP THE

01:34:22.990 --> 01:34:24.392
ECONOMY GOING, TO KEEP THE JOBS

01:34:24.458 --> 01:34:25.726
GOING, AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:34:25.793 --> 01:34:28.262
CAN DO IT IN A WAY THAT BENEFITS

01:34:28.329 --> 01:34:29.563
EVERYONE. SO ARE YOU SAYING WHEN

01:34:29.630 --> 01:34:31.298
YOU FIRST OF ALL, WHEN YOU TALK

01:34:31.365 --> 01:34:32.733
ABOUT DIVERSION, YOU'RE TALKING

01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:34.769
ABOUT ABOUT CONTAINER SHIPS

01:34:34.835 --> 01:34:36.570
BYPASSING PORTS OF LA AND LONG

01:34:36.637 --> 01:34:37.905
BEACH, GOING TO OTHER PORTS IN

01:34:37.972 --> 01:34:39.673
THE COUNTRY, YOU WANT TO BE ABLE

01:34:39.740 --> 01:34:41.742
TO STOP NOX EMISSIONS. SO IF YOU

01:34:41.809 --> 01:34:43.210
HAVE A BIG SOURCE OF NOX

01:34:43.277 --> 01:34:44.578
EMISSIONS, EITHER HOTELLING

01:34:44.645 --> 01:34:46.380
OFFSHORE OR TELLING AT THE

01:34:46.447 --> 01:34:47.481
PORTS, YOU CAN STOP THAT. YOU

01:34:47.548 --> 01:34:49.183
CAN MAKE THEM GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.

01:34:49.250 --> 01:34:51.419
SO THOSE NOX EMISSIONS DON'T

01:34:51.485 --> 01:34:52.787
NECESSARILY IMPACT THE AIR

01:34:52.853 --> 01:34:53.954
QUALITY IN THE SOUTH COAST

01:34:54.021 --> 01:34:56.123
REGION. THE SAME IS TRUE FOR A

01:34:56.190 --> 01:34:58.659
WHOLE HOST OF OTHER AREAS. I WAS

01:34:58.726 --> 01:35:00.728
JUST ASKING FOR CLARIFICATION ON

01:35:00.795 --> 01:35:03.564
YOUR USE OF THE TERM DIVERSION.

01:35:03.631 --> 01:35:04.965
COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHAT DIVERSION

01:35:05.032 --> 01:35:07.535
MEANS? DIVERSION WOULD MEAN THE

01:35:07.601 --> 01:35:11.105
TRANSFER OF EQUIPMENT, OF CARGO,

01:35:11.172 --> 01:35:13.774
OF GOODS, ALL SORTS OF THINGS TO

01:35:13.841 --> 01:35:15.709
OTHER PLACES SO THAT YOU DON'T

01:35:15.776 --> 01:35:17.378
HAVE THOSE SOURCES OF EMISSIONS

01:35:17.445 --> 01:35:19.346
WITHIN THAT AREA. THAT CREATES

01:35:19.413 --> 01:35:21.415
THE NOX PROBLEM, WHICH CAUSES

01:35:21.482 --> 01:35:23.284
THE OZONE, THE SMOG PROBLEMS

01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:24.952
THAT WE HAVE, WHICH CONTRIBUTES

01:35:25.019 --> 01:35:27.021
TO THE 1400 DEATHS IN THE SOUTH

01:35:27.088 --> 01:35:28.856
COAST REGION ALONE EACH YEAR.

01:35:28.923 --> 01:35:30.658
OKAY. AND AGAIN, I APPRECIATE

01:35:30.724 --> 01:35:32.460
ALL THE WORK THAT THE AQMD DOES

01:35:32.526 --> 01:35:33.527
TO PROTECT, YOU KNOW, LOCAL

01:35:33.594 --> 01:35:35.262
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS,

01:35:35.329 --> 01:35:39.300
INCLUDING MYSELF. BUT DOES THE

01:35:39.366 --> 01:35:44.405
AQMD STUDY THE GLOBAL GREENHOUSE

01:35:44.472 --> 01:35:47.942
GAS IMPACTS WHEN SHIPS ARE

01:35:48.008 --> 01:35:49.677
DIVERTED FROM THE PORTS OF LOS

01:35:49.743 --> 01:35:50.778
ANGELES AND LONG BEACH TO OTHER

01:35:50.845 --> 01:35:52.613
PORTS IN THE COUNTRY, WE

01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:54.748
WOULDN'T LOOK AT THE GHG

01:35:54.815 --> 01:35:55.816
COMPOSITION GOING TO OTHER

01:35:55.883 --> 01:35:57.918
AREAS. WE WOULD ONLY LOOK AT THE

01:35:57.985 --> 01:35:59.620
IMPACT THAT IT HAS TO THE SOUTH

01:35:59.687 --> 01:36:02.823
COAST REGION. OKAY, MAY I CHIME

01:36:02.890 --> 01:36:04.725
IN, MR. CHAIR, REGARDING THESE

01:36:04.792 --> 01:36:06.327
TWO SPECIFIC POINTS, WE HAVE

01:36:06.393 --> 01:36:07.394
SOME OTHER QUESTIONS FROM OTHER

01:36:07.461 --> 01:36:08.462
COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I THINK

01:36:08.529 --> 01:36:10.731
YOU'LL GET A CHANCE TO ADDRESS

01:36:10.798 --> 01:36:12.066
THOSE IN THE QUESTIONS AS WELL.

01:36:12.133 --> 01:36:13.434
OKAY. I'M SORRY IF I COULD JUST

01:36:13.501 --> 01:36:15.236
ASK MY LAST QUESTION, WHICH IS,

01:36:15.302 --> 01:36:19.673
YOU KNOW, I HAVE HEARD FOR YEARS

01:36:19.740 --> 01:36:21.442
HOW THE PORTS OF L.A. AND LONG

01:36:21.509 --> 01:36:23.544
BEACH ARE STRIVING FOR 100%

01:36:23.611 --> 01:36:27.181
ELECTRIFICATION OF THE PORTS.

01:36:27.248 --> 01:36:29.850
BASED ON MY AWARENESS OF THAT, I

01:36:29.917 --> 01:36:32.553
MEAN, THE TECHNOLOGY, THE COST

01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:33.921
JUST DOESN'T SEEM TO BE

01:36:33.988 --> 01:36:35.456
FEASIBLE. I MEAN, I'M HEARING

01:36:35.523 --> 01:36:37.591
ABOUT ELECTRIC TRUCKS COSTING,

01:36:37.658 --> 01:36:41.195
YOU KNOW, 350, $400,000 A TRUCK,

01:36:41.262 --> 01:36:43.631
YOU KNOW, NOT TO MENTION THE

01:36:43.697 --> 01:36:45.499
CAPACITY TO GENERATE THE AMOUNT

01:36:45.566 --> 01:36:48.335
OF ELECTRICITY NECESSARY TO 100%

01:36:48.402 --> 01:36:50.538
ELECTRIFY THE PORTS. AND SO, I

01:36:50.604 --> 01:36:52.940
GUESS MY IF I MAY, THANK YOU FOR

01:36:53.007 --> 01:36:56.577
YOUR PATIENCE, MR. CHAIR, BUT I,

01:36:56.644 --> 01:36:59.246
I JUST THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, THE

01:36:59.313 --> 01:37:01.315
REASON WHY IS HERE AT THE STATE

01:37:01.382 --> 01:37:03.384
LEVEL. NUMBER ONE, IT'S BECAUSE

01:37:03.450 --> 01:37:04.818
THIS ISSUE WAS NOT RESOLVED AT

01:37:04.885 --> 01:37:08.189
THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND, YOU KNOW,

01:37:08.255 --> 01:37:11.692
AND NUMBER TWO, YOU KNOW, I, I'M

01:37:11.759 --> 01:37:14.195
CONCERNED THAT AS MUCH AS I

01:37:14.261 --> 01:37:16.063
RESPECT YOUR EFFORTS TO CUT DOWN

01:37:16.130 --> 01:37:17.865
ON LOCAL AIR POLLUTION

01:37:17.932 --> 01:37:19.733
EMISSIONS, WE ALSO NEED TO

01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:21.835
BALANCE THAT WITH THESE ISSUES

01:37:21.902 --> 01:37:23.938
OF KEEPING OUR PORTS OF L.A. AND

01:37:24.004 --> 01:37:24.672
LONG BEACH COMPETITIVE. THANK

01:37:24.738 --> 01:37:30.377
YOU. THANK YOU. MR. SO THANK YOU

01:37:30.444 --> 01:37:32.313
FOR BEING HERE TODAY. THANK YOU

01:37:32.379 --> 01:37:36.283
FOR BRINGING THE BILL. I BEFORE

01:37:36.350 --> 01:37:37.751
YESTERDAY, I DON'T THINK I COULD

01:37:37.818 --> 01:37:39.853
HAVE SUPPORTED THIS BILL, BUT

01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:42.456
WHEN I'M LOOKING AT IT, IT LOOKS

01:37:42.523 --> 01:37:43.857
THAT WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT

01:37:43.924 --> 01:37:48.562
HAVE BEEN PROPOSED BY THE BY THE

01:37:48.629 --> 01:37:51.298
COMMITTEE, IT'S HARD FOR ME TO

01:37:51.365 --> 01:37:52.533
UNDERSTAND REALLY WHERE THE BEEF

01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:54.301
STILL IS WITH THE BILL. I

01:37:54.368 --> 01:37:56.470
TOTALLY UNDERSTAND WHY WE HAD SO

01:37:56.537 --> 01:37:58.272
MUCH ENVIRONMENTAL OPPOSITION TO

01:37:58.339 --> 01:37:59.673
THE PRIOR VERSION OF THE BILL.

01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:01.809
BUT WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT'S LEFT

01:38:01.875 --> 01:38:04.745
OF IT NOW, THERE SEEM TO BE TWO

01:38:04.812 --> 01:38:07.581
PIECES. ONE, THAT THE ACTION

01:38:07.648 --> 01:38:08.716
ACTION, MEANING THE INDIRECT

01:38:08.782 --> 01:38:12.119
SOURCE RULE WILL NOT RECOGNIZE,

01:38:12.186 --> 01:38:14.388
WILL RECOGNIZE THE CONTRIBUTIONS

01:38:14.455 --> 01:38:15.556
OF SOURCES OF AIR POLLUTION

01:38:15.623 --> 01:38:16.523
OUTSIDE THE CONTROL OF THE

01:38:16.590 --> 01:38:18.726
PORTS. USE OF THE WORD RECOGNIZE

01:38:18.792 --> 01:38:19.627
IS SOMETHING YOU WOULD DO

01:38:19.693 --> 01:38:21.662
ANYWAY. YOU WOULD BE TAKING INTO

01:38:21.729 --> 01:38:22.696
ACCOUNT OF THOSE, RIGHT? SO THIS

01:38:22.763 --> 01:38:25.432
DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING THAT YOU

01:38:25.499 --> 01:38:27.234
WOULD DO. IS THAT RIGHT? MR.

01:38:27.301 --> 01:38:28.736
NASTRI IS RIGHT. IF I TALK TO

01:38:28.802 --> 01:38:30.971
THE MICROPHONE. SURE. YES. YEAH,

01:38:31.038 --> 01:38:35.242
WE PREFER THAT. YEAH. YEAH. THE

01:38:35.309 --> 01:38:36.710
BASIS FOR OUR OPPOSITION IS THE

01:38:36.777 --> 01:38:40.314
PRECEDENT THAT THIS SETS FOR ANY

01:38:40.381 --> 01:38:42.449
GROUP THAT DOESN'T WANT TO BE

01:38:42.516 --> 01:38:44.685
HELD ACCOUNTABLE OR THAT DOESN'T

01:38:44.752 --> 01:38:46.086
WANT TO GO THROUGH THE

01:38:46.153 --> 01:38:47.988
RULEMAKING PROCESS OF THE SOUTH

01:38:48.055 --> 01:38:50.824
COAST AQMD TO RUN TO THE

01:38:50.891 --> 01:38:52.559
LEGISLATURE AND SAY, HEY, WE'RE

01:38:52.626 --> 01:38:54.128
DOING EVERYTHING WE'RE TRYING TO

01:38:54.194 --> 01:38:55.996
DO AND WE DON'T NEED THE SOUTH

01:38:56.063 --> 01:38:57.998
COAST. SO WHERE DOES IT STOP?

01:38:58.065 --> 01:38:59.733
YEAH. SO, I MEAN, I UNDERSTAND

01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:01.802
THE PRECEDENT ISSUE, AND I

01:39:01.869 --> 01:39:03.237
ACTUALLY SHARE THOSE CONCERNS TO

01:39:03.304 --> 01:39:08.442
A CERTAIN EXTENT. I ALSO, YOU

01:39:08.509 --> 01:39:10.644
KNOW, SHARE CONCERNS, THE FACT

01:39:10.711 --> 01:39:12.446
THAT WE DON'T WANT TO BE DOING

01:39:12.513 --> 01:39:13.747
THINGS THAT SORT OF

01:39:13.814 --> 01:39:15.049
UNNECESSARILY HARMING EMPLOYMENT

01:39:15.115 --> 01:39:17.718
AT THE PORTS. AND PART OF THE

01:39:17.785 --> 01:39:21.055
REASON WHY I BECAME MORE

01:39:21.121 --> 01:39:22.022
COMFORTABLE WITH THE BILL WAS

01:39:22.089 --> 01:39:24.258
BECAUSE WHEN I LOOKED AT WHAT IS

01:39:24.325 --> 01:39:26.293
LEFT OF THE BILL, IT DOESN'T

01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:28.162
LOOK TO ME LIKE ANY OF YOUR

01:39:28.228 --> 01:39:30.064
REGULATORY AUTHORITY TO CONTROL

01:39:30.130 --> 01:39:32.599
EMISSIONS ARE REDUCED. SO YOU

01:39:32.666 --> 01:39:34.702
HAVE THE ACTION SHALL DO ALL THE

01:39:34.768 --> 01:39:35.836
FOLLOWING. RECOGNIZE

01:39:35.903 --> 01:39:36.870
CONTRIBUTIONS OF SOURCES OF AIR

01:39:36.937 --> 01:39:37.838
POLLUTION OUTSIDE THE CONTROL OF

01:39:37.905 --> 01:39:40.374
THE PORTS. YOU ALREADY DO THAT

01:39:40.441 --> 01:39:41.942
REQUIRE THE PORTS TO REQUIRE

01:39:42.009 --> 01:39:43.077
ASSESSMENT OF ENERGY DEMAND AND

01:39:43.143 --> 01:39:45.145
SUPPLY, COST ESTIMATES, FUNDING,

01:39:45.212 --> 01:39:46.213
SOURCE, WORKFORCE AND

01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:47.147
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS ASSOCIATED

01:39:47.214 --> 01:39:48.916
WITH THE ACTION. YOU ALREADY DO

01:39:48.982 --> 01:39:50.517
THAT. I USED TO PRACTICE BEFORE

01:39:50.584 --> 01:39:52.753
YOUR BODY. I KNOW YOU DO THAT AS

01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:54.922
PART OF YOUR NORMAL RULEMAKING.

01:39:54.988 --> 01:39:56.390
SEA USE. THE ASSESSMENTS

01:39:56.457 --> 01:39:57.725
DEVELOPED BY THE PORTS PREPARED

01:39:57.791 --> 01:39:59.493
PURSUANT TO SUBPARAGRAPH BE THE

01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:01.495
THING I JUST TALKED ABOUT TO

01:40:01.562 --> 01:40:02.930
DETERMINE TIMELINES FOR

01:40:02.996 --> 01:40:04.565
ACHIEVING ACTION TARGETS. YOU

01:40:04.631 --> 01:40:07.768
ALREADY DO THAT. D CREATE A

01:40:07.835 --> 01:40:09.303
PROCESS BY WHICH THE PORTS CAN

01:40:09.370 --> 01:40:11.472
REQUEST EXTENSION TO TIMELINES

01:40:11.538 --> 01:40:13.240
DEVELOPED TO ACHIEVE THE ACTIONS

01:40:13.307 --> 01:40:15.743
TARGETS. YOU ALREADY DO THAT.

01:40:15.809 --> 01:40:17.144
AND THEN THERE'S THE

01:40:17.211 --> 01:40:19.713
PROHIBITIONS. THE ACTIONS SHALL

01:40:19.780 --> 01:40:21.715
NOT DO ANY OF THE FOLLOWING.

01:40:21.782 --> 01:40:23.751
IMPOSE A CAP ON CARGO THROUGHPUT

01:40:23.817 --> 01:40:25.085
AT THE PORTS DIRECTLY OR

01:40:25.152 --> 01:40:26.553
INDIRECTLY. NOW THAT'S NEW. AND

01:40:26.620 --> 01:40:28.722
I'VE SAID WE WON'T AND I BUT BUT

01:40:28.789 --> 01:40:30.491
IF YOU AREN'T GOING TO DO THAT

01:40:30.557 --> 01:40:31.792
THEN WHY WOULD YOU HAVE A

01:40:31.859 --> 01:40:32.593
PROBLEM PUTTING THAT IN PLACE,

01:40:32.659 --> 01:40:35.129
SINCE IT'S SUCH A BIG PART OF

01:40:35.195 --> 01:40:37.231
THE CONCERNS THAT THE WORKERS AT

01:40:37.297 --> 01:40:39.199
THE PORTS HAVE? CAN I CHIME IN

01:40:39.266 --> 01:40:40.601
NOW? BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO GO

01:40:40.667 --> 01:40:41.902
THROUGH I'M ASKING QUESTIONS AND

01:40:41.969 --> 01:40:44.037
I'LL GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:40:44.104 --> 01:40:45.873
SAY SOMETHING. IF THE CHAIR

01:40:45.939 --> 01:40:50.277
ALLOWS ME. SECOND PART WAS

01:40:50.344 --> 01:40:52.746
IMPOSE A CAP, BE BEFORE, REQUIRE

01:40:52.813 --> 01:40:54.381
ANY ACTIONS THAT REDUCE

01:40:54.448 --> 01:40:55.983
POLLUTION FROM SOURCES THAT ARE

01:40:56.049 --> 01:40:57.618
EXCLUSIVELY UNDER STATE OR

01:40:57.684 --> 01:40:58.952
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THAT'S GONE

01:40:59.019 --> 01:41:01.522
NOW. SO IF THAT HAD BEEN THERE

01:41:01.588 --> 01:41:02.656
BEFORE, I PROBABLY WOULD NOT

01:41:02.723 --> 01:41:04.057
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS

01:41:04.124 --> 01:41:06.927
BILL. THE OTHER ONE, C, SET

01:41:06.994 --> 01:41:07.961
SHORTER TIMELINES FOR ACHIEVING

01:41:08.028 --> 01:41:09.897
A BUNCH OF EMISSION REDUCTIONS.

01:41:09.963 --> 01:41:11.632
SO THIS IS ONE OF THE OTHER

01:41:11.698 --> 01:41:12.766
THINGS THAT ACTUALLY, I THINK

01:41:12.833 --> 01:41:14.134
INTRUDED ON YOUR AUTHORITY. AND

01:41:14.201 --> 01:41:16.203
THAT THING IS THAT THAT IS GONE

01:41:16.270 --> 01:41:19.239
NOW. AND SO IT'S LEFT ARE THE

01:41:19.306 --> 01:41:20.941
USE OF THE PUBLIC GRANTS RELATED

01:41:21.008 --> 01:41:24.211
TO THE AUTOMATION. AND THAT I

01:41:24.278 --> 01:41:25.412
THINK THE AUTOMATION PROBABLY

01:41:25.479 --> 01:41:27.047
NEEDS TO BE TIGHTENED UP SOME,

01:41:27.114 --> 01:41:28.015
BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY

01:41:28.081 --> 01:41:29.249
SOME AUTOMATED THINGS THAT ARE

01:41:29.316 --> 01:41:30.617
CURRENTLY BEING USED AT THE

01:41:30.684 --> 01:41:32.853
PORTS, BUT I THINK THAT'S THE

01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:34.755
SUBJECT MATTER FOR ANOTHER

01:41:34.822 --> 01:41:35.556
COMMITTEE. BUT I ALSO THINK THAT

01:41:35.622 --> 01:41:37.124
AUTOMATION IS REALLY IMPORTANT

01:41:37.191 --> 01:41:37.958
TO THE WORKERS, THAT WE'RE

01:41:38.025 --> 01:41:39.593
MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE NOT

01:41:39.660 --> 01:41:40.694
EXPORTING THOSE JOBS. SO WHEN I

01:41:40.761 --> 01:41:43.330
LOOK AT ALL OF THESE THINGS, I

01:41:43.397 --> 01:41:45.399
GUESS I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND

01:41:45.466 --> 01:41:48.202
WHAT'S LEFT. BEFORE I UNDERSTOOD

01:41:48.268 --> 01:41:50.103
EXACTLY WHY WE WOULD HAVE SUCH

01:41:50.170 --> 01:41:52.940
STRONG OUTPOURING OF OPPOSITION

01:41:53.006 --> 01:41:53.874
FOR THIS. BUT IT LOOKS TO ME

01:41:53.941 --> 01:41:56.376
LIKE WITH THE AMENDMENTS, YOUR

01:41:56.443 --> 01:41:59.746
AUTHORITY IS RETAINED TO REDUCE

01:41:59.813 --> 01:42:02.416
EMISSIONS THROUGH THE INDIRECT

01:42:02.483 --> 01:42:03.717
SOURCE RULE. YOU'RE NOT

01:42:03.784 --> 01:42:05.219
PROHIBITED FROM PROCEEDING WITH

01:42:05.285 --> 01:42:08.188
IT. YOU IMPOSE ALL YOUR CURRENT

01:42:08.255 --> 01:42:09.490
STANDARDS. NONE OF THAT IS

01:42:09.556 --> 01:42:10.791
WEAKENED, EXCEPT FOR THE FACT

01:42:10.858 --> 01:42:12.759
THAT YOU HAVE TWO NEW SETS OF

01:42:12.826 --> 01:42:15.195
STANDARDS YOU HAVE TO ABIDE BY.

01:42:15.262 --> 01:42:17.397
ONE IS NOT REDUCING CARGO

01:42:17.464 --> 01:42:18.832
THROUGHPUT, WHICH I THINK IS A

01:42:18.899 --> 01:42:20.734
NEW THING, AND I SUPPORT THAT.

01:42:20.801 --> 01:42:22.102
AND THE OTHER IS RELATED TO

01:42:22.169 --> 01:42:24.972
FOCUSING ON AUTOMATION. SO WITH

01:42:25.038 --> 01:42:27.774
THAT, WHERE WHERE IN THE BILL IS

01:42:27.841 --> 01:42:29.610
YOUR AUTHORITY FURTHER

01:42:29.676 --> 01:42:31.712
RESTRICTED. SO I BELIEVE IN THE

01:42:31.778 --> 01:42:33.413
SECTION THAT YOU IDENTIFIED

01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:36.149
REGARDING GRANTS, FUNDS AND THE

01:42:36.216 --> 01:42:37.985
LIKE, THERE'S A TERM IN THERE

01:42:38.051 --> 01:42:40.387
THAT SAYS INDIRECTLY, AND I

01:42:40.454 --> 01:42:42.289
THINK THAT INDIRECTLY IS A TERM

01:42:42.356 --> 01:42:45.492
THAT WE FEEL COULD BE

01:42:45.559 --> 01:42:47.728
INTERPRETED MANY DIFFERENT WAYS

01:42:47.794 --> 01:42:50.931
AND JUST LEAD TO LITIGATION. I

01:42:50.998 --> 01:42:52.366
THINK THE CHALLENGE THAT THAT

01:42:52.432 --> 01:42:53.901
WE'VE SEEN IS THAT WE KNOW THAT

01:42:53.967 --> 01:42:56.370
AN INDIRECT SOURCE RULE APPROACH

01:42:56.436 --> 01:42:57.905
WORKS. WE'VE DONE THAT WITH

01:42:57.971 --> 01:42:58.839
WAREHOUSES. IT'S BEEN THROUGH

01:42:58.906 --> 01:43:00.607
THE COURTS, IT'S BEEN APPROVED.

01:43:00.674 --> 01:43:02.409
WE'RE MOVING FORWARD. IN A WAY.

01:43:02.476 --> 01:43:04.278
I WOULD ALSO ARGUE THAT WHAT

01:43:04.344 --> 01:43:05.712
WE'VE SEEN WITH LONG BEACH

01:43:05.779 --> 01:43:08.649
CONTAINER TERMINAL, WITH REGARDS

01:43:08.715 --> 01:43:10.717
TO THEIR ELECTRIC UTILIZATION,

01:43:10.784 --> 01:43:13.153
THAT IT'S THERE. SO FROM THE

01:43:13.220 --> 01:43:15.055
PERSPECTIVE OF YOUR SPECIFIC

01:43:15.122 --> 01:43:17.224
POINTS, MY ANSWER WOULD BE FIRST

01:43:17.291 --> 01:43:18.992
IS THE PRECEDENT SETS A BAD

01:43:19.059 --> 01:43:21.428
PRECEDENT. AND THEN SECOND IS

01:43:21.495 --> 01:43:23.363
THAT THERE IS STILL LANGUAGE IN

01:43:23.430 --> 01:43:25.699
THERE THAT CAUSES TREMENDOUS

01:43:25.766 --> 01:43:27.301
CONCERN ON ITS INTERPRETATION.

01:43:27.367 --> 01:43:28.702
AND THEN ULTIMATELY THE

01:43:28.769 --> 01:43:30.604
IMPLEMENTATION. YEAH, I GUESS

01:43:30.671 --> 01:43:33.407
THE THING I WOULD SORT OF SAY IS

01:43:33.473 --> 01:43:35.542
ON THAT, YOU KNOW, WITH RESPECT

01:43:35.609 --> 01:43:37.077
TO THE PORTS, THE PORTS ARE SORT

01:43:37.144 --> 01:43:38.845
OF ESPECIALLY THE PORTS OF LOS

01:43:38.912 --> 01:43:40.213
ANGELES AND LONG BEACH ARE

01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:41.381
UNIQUE ENTITIES. THE LARGEST

01:43:41.448 --> 01:43:43.183
CONTAINER TERMINALS IN THE

01:43:43.250 --> 01:43:44.918
COUNTRY. I THINK WHEN WE'RE

01:43:44.985 --> 01:43:46.053
TALKING ABOUT ISSUES OF

01:43:46.119 --> 01:43:47.721
PRECEDENT, IT'S NOT LIKE HAVING

01:43:47.788 --> 01:43:49.890
SOME OTHER INDUSTRY COMING IN

01:43:49.957 --> 01:43:54.027
AND, AND, YOU KNOW, AND ASKING

01:43:54.094 --> 01:43:54.861
FOR SOMETHING THAT IS SORT OF

01:43:54.928 --> 01:43:56.463
DIFFERENT FROM YOUR NORMAL

01:43:56.530 --> 01:43:58.332
PROCESSES. AND I DO THINK THAT

01:43:58.398 --> 01:44:01.068
THE ISSUE OF CONCERN ABOUT

01:44:01.134 --> 01:44:03.337
REDUCTION IN, YOU KNOW, IN CARGO

01:44:03.403 --> 01:44:04.738
VOLUMES IS A YOU SAID YOU SAY

01:44:04.805 --> 01:44:06.607
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT

01:44:06.673 --> 01:44:07.908
ANYWAY. SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND

01:44:07.975 --> 01:44:09.343
WHY YOU'D HAVE A PROBLEM WITH

01:44:09.409 --> 01:44:11.244
THAT. I THINK ON THE AUTOMATION

01:44:11.311 --> 01:44:12.846
PIECE, I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS

01:44:12.913 --> 01:44:13.847
THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT WE'RE

01:44:13.914 --> 01:44:16.283
GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH AS A

01:44:16.350 --> 01:44:17.818
SOCIETY IS THE FACT THAT WE'VE

01:44:17.884 --> 01:44:18.852
GOT AUTOMATION THAT'S TAKING

01:44:18.919 --> 01:44:20.988
JOBS AWAY. AND SO I KNOW THIS

01:44:21.054 --> 01:44:22.255
MAY NOT BE PERFECT, BUT IT'S

01:44:22.322 --> 01:44:23.657
STARTING TO LOOK AT THAT SET OF

01:44:23.724 --> 01:44:26.026
ISSUES AND FRANKLY, YOU KNOW,

01:44:26.093 --> 01:44:28.028
TELL MR. PINEDA AND THE AUTHOR

01:44:28.095 --> 01:44:29.463
HERE, I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:44:29.529 --> 01:44:31.231
TIGHTENED UP SOME. I THINK

01:44:31.298 --> 01:44:31.898
THERE'S PROBABLY THINGS AT THE

01:44:31.965 --> 01:44:33.867
PORT THAT ARE SORT OF AUTOMATED

01:44:33.934 --> 01:44:35.335
UNDER THIS DEFINITION THAT ARE

01:44:35.402 --> 01:44:36.436
CURRENTLY USED AND WOULD NOT

01:44:36.503 --> 01:44:38.538
TAKE AWAY JOBS. AND SO I THINK

01:44:38.605 --> 01:44:39.706
THAT PART NEEDS TO BE TIGHTENED

01:44:39.773 --> 01:44:41.942
UP. BUT IT IS AN APPROPRIATE

01:44:42.009 --> 01:44:43.577
THING, I THINK, FOR US TO LOOK

01:44:43.644 --> 01:44:44.578
AT. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS

01:44:44.645 --> 01:44:47.447
REALLY UNIQUE TO THE PORTS. SO

01:44:47.514 --> 01:44:51.318
WITH THAT, YOU KNOW, I I'M

01:44:51.385 --> 01:44:52.052
COMFORTABLE. THERE'S NOTHING

01:44:52.119 --> 01:44:54.254
THAT I CAN SEE IN HERE THAT'S

01:44:54.321 --> 01:44:54.888
TAKING AWAY YOUR NORMAL

01:44:54.955 --> 01:44:57.491
AUTHORITY TO PROTECT THE

01:44:57.557 --> 01:44:58.725
COMMUNITIES AROUND THE PORTS, OR

01:44:58.792 --> 01:45:02.562
THAT RESTRICTS YOUR ABILITY TO,

01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:03.897
TO EVEN DEAL WITH THE ISSUES

01:45:03.964 --> 01:45:06.333
THAT I THINK MY COLLEAGUE FROM

01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:09.369
TORRANCE IS CONCERNED ABOUT. SO

01:45:09.436 --> 01:45:11.471
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO HAVE

01:45:11.538 --> 01:45:13.340
ONE FINAL COMMENT AND THEN I'M

01:45:13.407 --> 01:45:14.775
GOING TO STOP TALKING. SO THANK

01:45:14.841 --> 01:45:17.577
YOU. MEMBER. AS I SAID BEFORE,

01:45:17.644 --> 01:45:19.746
THE MAIN CONCERN THAT I HAVE IS

01:45:19.813 --> 01:45:21.648
THE SLIPPERY SLOPE. AND THEN

01:45:21.715 --> 01:45:24.051
THIS IS JUST THE FIRST OF MANY

01:45:24.117 --> 01:45:25.919
OTHER ATTEMPTS TO TRY TO

01:45:25.986 --> 01:45:27.654
DIMINISH A REGULATORY AGENCY'S

01:45:27.721 --> 01:45:29.790
AUTHORITY. THE ISSUE OF

01:45:29.856 --> 01:45:31.425
AUTOMATION. THE SOUTH COAST AQMD

01:45:31.491 --> 01:45:33.260
HAS ALWAYS BEEN VOCAL IN SUPPORT

01:45:33.326 --> 01:45:35.295
OF HUMAN OPERATED EQUIPMENT. WE

01:45:35.362 --> 01:45:38.598
JUST WANT THAT EQUIPMENT TO BE

01:45:38.665 --> 01:45:40.901
ZERO EMISSION, AND WE'VE BEEN A

01:45:40.967 --> 01:45:41.635
LONGTIME SUPPORTER OF THAT.

01:45:41.702 --> 01:45:43.704
WE'LL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THAT.

01:45:43.770 --> 01:45:47.240
THE SOUTH COAST AQMD IS CLOSE TO

01:45:47.307 --> 01:45:50.110
BRINGING A RULE TO OUR BOARD, TO

01:45:50.177 --> 01:45:54.114
THE POINT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO

01:45:54.181 --> 01:45:55.482
RESOLVE THESE MATTERS. WE THINK

01:45:55.549 --> 01:45:57.284
THAT THE APPROACH THAT WE'RE

01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:59.653
BRINGING, WORKING WITH ALL OF

01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:01.788
THE STAKEHOLDERS, IS A WAY THAT

01:46:01.855 --> 01:46:04.191
WE CAN ADDRESS THE EMISSION

01:46:04.257 --> 01:46:06.727
REDUCTIONS AND GET A COMMITMENT

01:46:06.793 --> 01:46:08.729
TO PUT FORWARD A PLAN THAT

01:46:08.795 --> 01:46:10.597
ACTUALLY THE PARTIES CAN BE HELD

01:46:10.664 --> 01:46:12.165
ACCOUNTABLE FOR. WE'VE BEEN

01:46:12.232 --> 01:46:13.667
TRYING TO DO THAT FOR A NUMBER

01:46:13.734 --> 01:46:16.069
OF YEARS. WE'VE TRIED WE THOUGHT

01:46:16.136 --> 01:46:17.070
WE HAD AGREEMENTS. WE

01:46:17.137 --> 01:46:19.306
UNFORTUNATELY DID NOT. I THINK

01:46:19.372 --> 01:46:21.742
THAT IF THIS BODY WERE TO WAIT

01:46:21.808 --> 01:46:23.844
AND SEE WHAT COMES OUT OF THE

01:46:23.910 --> 01:46:25.612
SOUTH COAST, AQMD AND THE

01:46:25.679 --> 01:46:27.547
PROCESS COME THIS FALL, WE WOULD

01:46:27.614 --> 01:46:30.317
ALL HAVE THE SAME OPINION. WE

01:46:30.383 --> 01:46:33.353
WERE ABLE TO DEVELOP A RULE THAT

01:46:33.420 --> 01:46:35.122
ADDRESSES COMMUNITY CONCERNS AND

01:46:35.188 --> 01:46:36.623
CREATES TIMELINES, THAT HOLDS

01:46:36.690 --> 01:46:37.758
PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT

01:46:37.824 --> 01:46:39.292
THEY'RE SAYING THEY'RE GOING TO

01:46:39.359 --> 01:46:40.327
DO. THEY'RE GOING TO DEVELOP A

01:46:40.393 --> 01:46:42.129
PLAN, NOT US. WE'RE GOING TO

01:46:42.195 --> 01:46:44.431
CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD. AND

01:46:44.498 --> 01:46:45.766
THAT'S MY MAIN CONCERN, IS THAT

01:46:45.832 --> 01:46:47.934
WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO WHAT'S

01:46:48.001 --> 01:46:49.770
RIGHT, TO DO WHAT'S REQUIRED

01:46:49.836 --> 01:46:51.271
UNDER THE LAW, AND TO NOT HAVE

01:46:51.338 --> 01:46:53.673
OUR AUTHORITIES CHIPPED AWAY AS

01:46:53.740 --> 01:46:55.208
WE SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE

01:46:55.275 --> 01:46:57.477
FEDERAL LEVEL. YEAH, I GUESS THE

01:46:57.544 --> 01:46:58.779
LAST THING I'LL SAY IS I JUST

01:46:58.845 --> 01:46:59.880
DON'T SEE AND I THINK YOU

01:46:59.946 --> 01:47:00.714
HAVEN'T IDENTIFIED ANYTHING

01:47:00.781 --> 01:47:01.915
OTHER THAN THE CARGO THROUGHPUT

01:47:01.982 --> 01:47:03.216
AND THE AUTOMATION WHERE YOUR

01:47:03.283 --> 01:47:04.584
AUTHORITY IS CHIPPED AWAY AT

01:47:04.651 --> 01:47:05.619
ALL. I JUST DON'T SEE YOUR

01:47:05.685 --> 01:47:06.753
AUTHORITY CHIPPED AWAY. IT'S

01:47:06.820 --> 01:47:07.888
LIKE EVERYTHING THAT'S IN THE

01:47:07.954 --> 01:47:10.056
BILL YOU DO ANYWAY. AND IT

01:47:10.123 --> 01:47:10.690
DOESN'T. IT'S NOT TAKING AWAY

01:47:10.757 --> 01:47:12.025
YOUR THE OTHER STANDARDS THAT

01:47:12.092 --> 01:47:14.060
YOU APPLY TO PROTECT THE

01:47:14.127 --> 01:47:15.428
ENVIRONMENT, TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:47:15.495 --> 01:47:17.097
EVERYTHING IS COST EFFECTIVE,

01:47:17.164 --> 01:47:18.732
ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU NORMALLY

01:47:18.799 --> 01:47:19.733
DO WHEN YOU ADOPT A RULE. SO

01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:21.735
ANYWAY, WITH THAT, I JUST WANT

01:47:21.802 --> 01:47:23.236
TO THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING MY

01:47:23.303 --> 01:47:25.438
QUESTIONS. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS

01:47:25.505 --> 01:47:28.708
BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS, MR. ELLIS?

01:47:28.775 --> 01:47:30.744
THE GENTLEMAN, MR. CHAIR AND

01:47:30.811 --> 01:47:34.347
SENATOR, I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THE

01:47:34.414 --> 01:47:37.450
GENTLEMAN FROM SOUTH COAST. SIR,

01:47:37.517 --> 01:47:40.120
OF A MILLION BARRELS A DAY THAT

01:47:40.187 --> 01:47:43.490
WE IMPORT OF CRUDE OIL FROM

01:47:43.557 --> 01:47:44.357
FOREIGN COUNTRIES. HOW MUCH

01:47:44.424 --> 01:47:46.827
COMES INTO THE SOUTH COAST? I

01:47:46.893 --> 01:47:48.528
COULDN'T TELL YOU THE PETROLEUM

01:47:48.595 --> 01:47:51.798
THROUGHPUT RIGHT NOW, SIR. DO

01:47:51.865 --> 01:47:54.401
YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF FUEL THOSE

01:47:54.467 --> 01:47:56.937
SHIPS BURN WHEN THEY COME IN?

01:47:57.003 --> 01:47:58.305
THOSE SHIPS ARE REQUIRED TO BURN

01:47:58.371 --> 01:48:00.807
A CLEANER FUEL AS A RESULT OF

01:48:00.874 --> 01:48:02.809
THE REQUIREMENT FROM EPA AND

01:48:02.876 --> 01:48:05.312
FROM CARB THAT THEY BURN CLEANER

01:48:05.378 --> 01:48:07.347
FUELS. BUT IF THEY'RE ACTUALLY

01:48:07.414 --> 01:48:08.615
BERTHED, THEY SHOULD BE USING

01:48:08.682 --> 01:48:13.053
SHORE POWER. SO CAN I TELL YOU

01:48:13.119 --> 01:48:14.788
THAT THEY BURN NUMBER SIX FUEL

01:48:14.855 --> 01:48:17.190
OIL TO WITHIN ABOUT 25 MILES

01:48:17.257 --> 01:48:20.393
OUT? IS THAT CORRECT? IT COULD

01:48:20.460 --> 01:48:23.563
BE CORRECT, YES. SO THAT'S MOST

01:48:23.630 --> 01:48:25.532
ONE OF THE MOST UNREFINED

01:48:25.599 --> 01:48:26.967
PRODUCTS. SO ARE YOU FAMILIAR

01:48:27.033 --> 01:48:28.835
WITH POLYNUCLEAR AROMATIC

01:48:28.902 --> 01:48:31.171
HYDROCARBONS? YES. DO YOU KNOW

01:48:31.238 --> 01:48:33.039
THAT THOSE SHIPS BURNING THAT

01:48:33.106 --> 01:48:36.109
NUMBER SIX, FUEL OIL, INTERNAL

01:48:36.176 --> 01:48:36.977
COMBUSTION ENGINES UNTIL THEY

01:48:37.043 --> 01:48:39.679
GET 25 MILES OUT BEFORE THEY

01:48:39.746 --> 01:48:41.381
CONVERT TO LOW SULFUR DIESEL ARE

01:48:41.448 --> 01:48:46.253
EMITTING PARTICULATE AND THOSE

01:48:46.319 --> 01:48:49.389
THOSE BENZOPYRENE PROTEINS, THEY

01:48:49.456 --> 01:48:50.824
SHOULD BE BURNING A CLEANER

01:48:50.891 --> 01:48:53.326
DISTILLATE FUEL. SIR. THAT'S A

01:48:53.393 --> 01:48:54.794
REQUIREMENT OF US EPA. THEY

01:48:54.861 --> 01:48:56.963
SHOULD BE. THEY SHOULD BE. SO IF

01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:59.966
SOMEONE'S BURNING WHAT I BELIEVE

01:49:00.033 --> 01:49:00.567
TO UNDERSTAND, YOU'RE SAYING

01:49:00.634 --> 01:49:01.968
BASICALLY A BUNKER FUEL. THAT'S

01:49:02.035 --> 01:49:03.870
CORRECT. THEY SHOULD NOT BE

01:49:03.937 --> 01:49:05.272
BURNING BUNKER FUEL. AND IF, IN

01:49:05.338 --> 01:49:07.707
FACT, THAT THEY ARE EPA THROUGH

01:49:07.774 --> 01:49:09.676
THE COAST GUARD COULD TAKE

01:49:09.743 --> 01:49:11.077
ACTION ON THAT BY LOOKING AT

01:49:11.144 --> 01:49:12.612
THEIR LOT OF 25 MILES. SO I'M

01:49:12.679 --> 01:49:13.847
TALKING ABOUT THE I'M TALKING

01:49:13.914 --> 01:49:15.682
ABOUT THE AREA 25 MILES OUT.

01:49:15.749 --> 01:49:17.183
THERE'S NOT AN INTERNATIONAL

01:49:17.250 --> 01:49:19.152
STANDARD 25 MILES OUT. TO MY

01:49:19.219 --> 01:49:21.521
RECOLLECTION, THE US IS PART OF

01:49:21.588 --> 01:49:23.290
IT'S CALLED AN EPA, AN EMISSION

01:49:23.356 --> 01:49:25.091
CONTROL AREA THAT WAS RATIFIED

01:49:25.158 --> 01:49:28.361
BY CONGRESS IN 2007. AND MY

01:49:28.428 --> 01:49:29.829
UNDERSTANDING ON THAT WAS WITHIN

01:49:29.896 --> 01:49:31.598
200 MILES. THEY HAD TO USE THAT

01:49:31.665 --> 01:49:33.967
CLEANER DISTILLATE FUEL. BUT WE

01:49:34.034 --> 01:49:36.836
CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT, CAN WE? SO

01:49:36.903 --> 01:49:39.339
LET ME ASK YOU MY NEXT MY NEXT

01:49:39.406 --> 01:49:40.674
QUESTION, SINCE WE DON'T HAVE

01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:43.543
THE ELECTRICAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO

01:49:43.610 --> 01:49:46.880
SUPPORT ELECTRIFICATION, THEN

01:49:46.947 --> 01:49:48.848
WHAT WOULD YOU CONSIDER? THE

01:49:48.915 --> 01:49:50.483
ANSWER IS THEN TO GO TO ZERO

01:49:50.550 --> 01:49:53.486
EMISSIONS IN THAT PARTICULAR

01:49:53.553 --> 01:49:54.421
TIMELINE. THAT'S A GREAT

01:49:54.487 --> 01:49:56.656
QUESTION. AND THAT'S WHY, AS

01:49:56.723 --> 01:49:57.958
WHAT WE'RE ASKING OF THE PORTS

01:49:58.024 --> 01:50:00.427
IS TO PUT TOGETHER A PLAN TO

01:50:00.493 --> 01:50:01.728
IDENTIFY WHAT ARE THOSE

01:50:01.795 --> 01:50:02.996
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS, WHAT ARE

01:50:03.063 --> 01:50:05.432
THE POWER NEEDS? WHAT IS THAT

01:50:05.498 --> 01:50:07.100
POWER GOING TO LOOK LIKE?

01:50:07.167 --> 01:50:08.201
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY

01:50:08.268 --> 01:50:09.936
HAVE TO JUST BE ELECTRICAL,

01:50:10.003 --> 01:50:11.805
RIGHT? IT COULD BE HYDROGEN. YOU

01:50:11.871 --> 01:50:13.873
COULD LOOK AT A FUEL CELL

01:50:13.940 --> 01:50:14.641
APPLICATION. YOU COULD LOOK AT

01:50:14.708 --> 01:50:16.543
THE USE OF METHANOL AS ONE OF

01:50:16.609 --> 01:50:18.578
THE PARTICULAR FUELS. SO THERE'S

01:50:18.645 --> 01:50:20.547
A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ENERGY

01:50:20.613 --> 01:50:21.581
SOURCES. WE JUST WANT TO MAKE

01:50:21.648 --> 01:50:23.049
SURE THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED ALL

01:50:23.116 --> 01:50:25.218
THE APPROPRIATE AND APPLICABLE

01:50:25.285 --> 01:50:27.087
ENERGY SOURCES, HOW YOU'RE GOING

01:50:27.153 --> 01:50:28.788
TO PLAN FOR THEM, HOW YOU'RE

01:50:28.855 --> 01:50:30.357
GOING TO FINANCE THEM, AND THEN

01:50:30.423 --> 01:50:31.624
ULTIMATELY, HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY

01:50:31.691 --> 01:50:34.728
IMPLEMENT THAT. SO I GUESS THIS

01:50:34.794 --> 01:50:35.929
SENATOR, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR

01:50:35.996 --> 01:50:37.864
BRINGING THIS FORWARD BECAUSE I

01:50:37.931 --> 01:50:39.065
COMMEND YOU. I LIKE THE

01:50:39.132 --> 01:50:41.601
DIFFERENTIATION AND I'M GOING TO

01:50:41.668 --> 01:50:43.837
SUPPORT THIS. THANK YOU. THANK

01:50:43.903 --> 01:50:44.671
YOU SIR. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS

01:50:44.738 --> 01:50:47.874
FROM COLLEAGUES OF THE DÃAS, MR.

01:50:47.941 --> 01:50:52.379
CONNELLY? THANK YOU. ALSO

01:50:52.445 --> 01:50:55.749
APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION TODAY.

01:50:55.815 --> 01:50:57.450
SO I'M I'M KIND OF GRAPPLING IN

01:50:57.517 --> 01:51:00.387
THE SENSE THAT RECOGNIZING THE

01:51:00.453 --> 01:51:02.622
IMMENSE IMPORTANCE ECONOMICALLY

01:51:02.689 --> 01:51:07.227
OF THE PORTS, THE WORKFORCE. ON

01:51:07.293 --> 01:51:09.362
THE OTHER HAND, I THINK SEVERAL

01:51:09.429 --> 01:51:11.664
QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED THAT

01:51:11.731 --> 01:51:14.034
THAT WARRANT FURTHER DISCUSSION.

01:51:14.100 --> 01:51:15.869
I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:51:15.935 --> 01:51:20.573
PRECEDENT. COULD THIS BILL HAVE

01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:23.043
A RIPPLING EFFECT ON OTHER AIR

01:51:23.109 --> 01:51:24.878
QUALITY DISTRICTS AROUND THE

01:51:24.944 --> 01:51:27.047
STATE? CAN YOU SPEAK ON HOW

01:51:27.113 --> 01:51:28.715
LIMITING ONE AIR DISTRICT'S

01:51:28.782 --> 01:51:32.185
ABILITY TO REGULATE COULD AFFECT

01:51:32.252 --> 01:51:33.486
OTHER AIR DISTRICTS IN THE

01:51:33.553 --> 01:51:39.659
STATE? DO I GET A TURN? THANK

01:51:39.726 --> 01:51:42.162
YOU, MR. CHAIR, OR WHOEVER YOU'D

01:51:42.228 --> 01:51:44.697
LIKE TO ANSWER? SURE. YEAH. SO,

01:51:44.764 --> 01:51:46.199
PERMISSION TO ANSWER THROUGH THE

01:51:46.266 --> 01:51:49.569
CHAIR? YEAH. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

01:51:49.636 --> 01:51:51.938
MEMBER CONNELLY, THE ORIGINAL

01:51:52.005 --> 01:51:54.774
PROPOSED RULE OF 2304 APPLIED TO

01:51:54.841 --> 01:51:57.944
THE SOUTH COAST DISTRICT. AND SO

01:51:58.011 --> 01:52:00.080
THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY STATES

01:52:00.146 --> 01:52:02.282
IT'S DEALING WITH THE SOUTH

01:52:02.348 --> 01:52:04.084
COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT

01:52:04.150 --> 01:52:05.819
DISTRICT. ORIGINALLY, WE DID

01:52:05.885 --> 01:52:07.987
INCLUDE UP NORTH, AND OAKLAND IS

01:52:08.054 --> 01:52:10.390
A SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER PORT

01:52:10.457 --> 01:52:12.659
THAN THE PORTS OF LONG BEACH AND

01:52:12.725 --> 01:52:14.027
LOS ANGELES. AND SO THEY WERE

01:52:14.094 --> 01:52:15.595
ASKED TO BE REMOVED OUT OF IT.

01:52:15.662 --> 01:52:17.931
AND WE DID. AND SO IT KEPT THIS

01:52:17.997 --> 01:52:20.633
BILL VERY PERFECTLY ALIGNED THAT

01:52:20.700 --> 01:52:22.202
IT WOULD BE SOUTH COAST AIR

01:52:22.268 --> 01:52:24.204
QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT

01:52:24.270 --> 01:52:26.439
ONLY, AND NOT REFERRING TO THE

01:52:26.506 --> 01:52:28.575
OTHER DISTRICTS. THIS BILL IS

01:52:28.641 --> 01:52:30.477
SPECIFICALLY IN SEVERAL POINTS

01:52:30.543 --> 01:52:34.047
SPEAKS TO THAT. YEAH, I GUESS I

01:52:34.114 --> 01:52:36.583
APPRECIATE THAT DETAIL. I THINK

01:52:36.649 --> 01:52:38.218
THERE STILL IS THE CONCEPT OUT

01:52:38.284 --> 01:52:39.886
THERE THOUGH. GOING FORWARD.

01:52:39.953 --> 01:52:43.189
THIS DOES KIND OF OPEN THE DOOR

01:52:43.256 --> 01:52:46.159
TO THE STATE COMING IN. AND

01:52:46.226 --> 01:52:47.527
FRANKLY, IN THIS CASE, AND THIS

01:52:47.594 --> 01:52:50.730
IS KIND OF MY SECOND QUESTION,

01:52:50.797 --> 01:52:51.898
I'VE HEARD EIGHT YEARS, I'VE

01:52:51.965 --> 01:52:56.202
HEARD TEN YEARS. BUT IN EITHER

01:52:56.269 --> 01:52:57.604
SCENARIO, IT'S BEEN A LENGTHY

01:52:57.670 --> 01:53:01.708
KIND OF COMMUNITY BASED PROCESS.

01:53:01.774 --> 01:53:03.409
WHY WHY ARE YOU SEEKING THROUGH

01:53:03.476 --> 01:53:07.680
SB 34 TO BYPASS THE

01:53:07.747 --> 01:53:08.848
COLLABORATIVE PROCESS THAT'S

01:53:08.915 --> 01:53:11.251
BEEN GOING ON FOR EIGHT YEARS?

01:53:11.317 --> 01:53:13.486
AND IN FACT, DOWN THE ROAD, A

01:53:13.553 --> 01:53:14.687
SIMILAR THING COULD HAPPEN,

01:53:14.754 --> 01:53:17.524
WHETHER IT IS OAKLAND IN THE

01:53:17.590 --> 01:53:20.827
FUTURE, TO BE HONEST. SO THAT'S

01:53:20.894 --> 01:53:22.829
CONCERNING. SURE. IF I MIGHT,

01:53:22.896 --> 01:53:24.364
THROUGH THE CHAIR, YOU ASKED

01:53:24.430 --> 01:53:25.431
BASICALLY TWO QUESTIONS. THE

01:53:25.498 --> 01:53:27.133
FIRST ONE I'D LIKE TO ANSWER HAS

01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:29.102
TO DO WITH PRECEDENTS. I WOULD

01:53:29.169 --> 01:53:31.571
SAY TO YOU THAT AS WHEN WE

01:53:31.638 --> 01:53:33.106
ADOPTED, WHEN THE STATE ADOPTED

01:53:33.173 --> 01:53:35.208
TERM LIMITS, THAT'S WHEN WE

01:53:35.275 --> 01:53:37.177
BEGAN PRECEDENTS OF DEFERRING

01:53:37.243 --> 01:53:40.246
OUR AUTHORITY AND OUR

01:53:40.313 --> 01:53:42.148
RESPONSIBILITY AS LEGISLATORS TO

01:53:42.215 --> 01:53:44.584
REALLY, FRANKLY, DO OUR JOB AND

01:53:44.651 --> 01:53:46.052
TO MAKE SURE THAT THINGS THAT

01:53:46.119 --> 01:53:48.021
LAWS WERE CONSISTENT AND

01:53:48.087 --> 01:53:49.923
APPROPRIATE FOR OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:53:49.989 --> 01:53:52.125
IT WAS ONLY THEN THAT VARIOUS

01:53:52.192 --> 01:53:53.826
LOCAL AIR QUALITY DISTRICTS

01:53:53.893 --> 01:53:56.162
BEGAN TO TAKE MORE OWNERSHIP,

01:53:56.229 --> 01:53:57.864
MORE INVOLVEMENT, AS THEY WERE

01:53:57.931 --> 01:53:59.999
DIRECTED BY THE LEGISLATURE. SO

01:54:00.066 --> 01:54:01.367
FIRST OF ALL, THAT'S WHEN THE

01:54:01.434 --> 01:54:03.670
FIRST PRECEDENTS BEGAN. SECOND

01:54:03.736 --> 01:54:05.705
OF ALL, I COULD GIVE YOU A LIST

01:54:05.772 --> 01:54:08.908
OF 200 BILLS RIGHT NOW WHERE WE

01:54:08.975 --> 01:54:11.144
ARE. WE AS THE LEGISLATURE ARE

01:54:11.211 --> 01:54:13.947
GIVING DIRECTION TO A PARTICULAR

01:54:14.013 --> 01:54:15.782
AGENCY. WE DO THAT IN OUR BILLS

01:54:15.848 --> 01:54:17.383
ALL DAY. THIS THIS BILL IS NO

01:54:17.450 --> 01:54:19.419
DIFFERENT THAN THAT. THIS BILL.

01:54:19.485 --> 01:54:21.487
IN FACT, THE DIFFERENCE, I WOULD

01:54:21.554 --> 01:54:23.356
SAY, IS THAT IT SAYS THE

01:54:23.423 --> 01:54:25.558
ADOPTION, THE AMENDMENT OR ANY

01:54:25.625 --> 01:54:27.460
OTHER RULE OR REGULATION

01:54:27.527 --> 01:54:28.528
ADOPTED. IT'S NOT SAYING THAT

01:54:28.595 --> 01:54:30.863
THEY CAN'T ADOPT ANY ACTION THAT

01:54:30.930 --> 01:54:32.665
THEY CHOOSE TO ADOPT. IT JUST

01:54:32.732 --> 01:54:34.500
SAYS WITHIN THE GUARDRAILS OF

01:54:34.567 --> 01:54:36.669
ADOPTING, OF DOING THEIR WORK,

01:54:36.736 --> 01:54:38.438
THEY NEED TO CONSIDER A FEW

01:54:38.504 --> 01:54:40.073
THINGS. ONE. NUMBER ONE, THEY

01:54:40.139 --> 01:54:41.608
NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE

01:54:41.674 --> 01:54:42.575
CONSIDERING THINGS THAT ARE

01:54:42.642 --> 01:54:45.011
WITHIN THE CONTROL OF THAT BODY.

01:54:45.078 --> 01:54:47.113
SO I WOULD STRONGLY DISAGREE

01:54:47.180 --> 01:54:48.948
WITH THE POINT OF PRECEDENCE,

01:54:49.015 --> 01:54:50.783
BECAUSE THE PRECEDENT IS, IS

01:54:50.850 --> 01:54:52.986
THEY STILL HAVE THE AUTHORITY IN

01:54:53.052 --> 01:54:54.721
THIS BILL AND ALSO CONFIRMED IN

01:54:54.787 --> 01:54:56.756
YOUR COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. NOW,

01:54:56.823 --> 01:54:59.058
SIR, IF YOU HAD ANY QUESTIONS OR

01:54:59.125 --> 01:55:00.593
SOMETHING, YOU'D LIKE US TO

01:55:00.660 --> 01:55:02.362
FURTHER WORK ON, THE BILL IS

01:55:02.428 --> 01:55:04.530
GOING NEXT TO TRANSPORTATION,

01:55:04.597 --> 01:55:06.866
WHICH WOULD BE NEXT WEEK. IF THE

01:55:06.933 --> 01:55:08.167
COMMITTEE OR YOURSELVES HAVE

01:55:08.234 --> 01:55:09.502
ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE US TO WORK

01:55:09.569 --> 01:55:11.771
ON, OF COURSE, WE'D BE WILLING

01:55:11.838 --> 01:55:13.439
TO CONSIDER TO DO THAT IN

01:55:13.506 --> 01:55:14.540
TRANSPORTATION. AND THEN ALSO

01:55:14.607 --> 01:55:16.709
WHEN IT GOES TO THE FLOOR, WE

01:55:16.776 --> 01:55:18.778
HAVE TO BE VERY CLEAR. WE'VE

01:55:18.845 --> 01:55:20.913
WORKED ON THIS FOR SEVEN MONTHS.

01:55:20.980 --> 01:55:22.482
I HAVEN'T GOTTEN A SINGLE THING

01:55:22.548 --> 01:55:24.250
FROM SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY

01:55:24.317 --> 01:55:26.252
MANAGEMENT, DISTRICT OF CHANGES

01:55:26.319 --> 01:55:28.721
OF TERMS OR AMENDMENTS. IT'S

01:55:28.788 --> 01:55:31.291
BEEN SAID BY PEOPLE, AND I KNOW

01:55:31.357 --> 01:55:33.092
SOME OF YOU HAVE HEARD IT. OH,

01:55:33.159 --> 01:55:34.627
WE'VE GIVEN THEM AMENDMENTS.

01:55:34.694 --> 01:55:36.863
SHOW ME AN EMAIL WHERE YOU GAVE

01:55:36.929 --> 01:55:39.065
ME AN AMENDMENT. WE HAVE I THIS

01:55:39.132 --> 01:55:42.135
IS MY TIME. THIS IS MY TIME. WE

01:55:42.201 --> 01:55:46.272
HAVE NOT WE RECEIVED A PHONE

01:55:46.339 --> 01:55:47.640
CALL WHICH WE RESPONDED AND

01:55:47.707 --> 01:55:49.409
DISCUSSED, BUT THERE HAS NOT

01:55:49.475 --> 01:55:52.011
BEEN AN ONGOING POINT. NOW, TO

01:55:52.078 --> 01:55:54.113
ANSWER YOUR SECOND QUESTION OF

01:55:54.180 --> 01:55:56.316
WHY? WHY ARE WE DOING THIS NOW?

01:55:56.382 --> 01:55:58.451
I HEARD THE GENTLEMAN THERE TALK

01:55:58.518 --> 01:56:00.720
ABOUT SEVEN YEARS HE'S BEEN ON

01:56:00.787 --> 01:56:02.989
THE BOARD FOR SEVEN YEARS. NOT

01:56:03.056 --> 01:56:05.024
ME. I'VE BEEN HERE FOR SEVEN

01:56:05.091 --> 01:56:07.060
MONTHS. I'VE SERVED IN THE

01:56:07.126 --> 01:56:08.428
ASSEMBLY, I'VE SERVED IN

01:56:08.494 --> 01:56:10.263
CONGRESS, AND NOW I'M HERE. SO

01:56:10.330 --> 01:56:12.365
WHY AM I DOING IT? IS BECAUSE I

01:56:12.432 --> 01:56:14.300
LIKE YOU. I'M TIRED OF LISTENING

01:56:14.367 --> 01:56:16.069
TO IT. I'M TIRED OF NOTHING

01:56:16.135 --> 01:56:18.338
GETTING DONE. REALLY. TO ME, THE

01:56:18.404 --> 01:56:19.405
QUESTION THAT SHOULD BE ASKED

01:56:19.472 --> 01:56:21.841
IS, WHY ARE THE PEOPLE WHO'VE

01:56:21.908 --> 01:56:22.642
BEEN IN THE POSITION FOR SEVEN,

01:56:22.709 --> 01:56:25.044
TEN, FIVE YEARS HAVE NOT SOLVED

01:56:25.111 --> 01:56:27.213
THIS? THE PORT OF LONG BEACH

01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:29.048
MADE AN OFFER AND SAID, WE'RE

01:56:29.115 --> 01:56:31.451
WILLING TO DO ELECTRIFICATION

01:56:31.517 --> 01:56:34.153
AND PUT 500 MILLION INTO IT. AND

01:56:34.220 --> 01:56:36.022
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WERE TOLD?

01:56:36.089 --> 01:56:38.391
POUND SAND. WE THINK WE CAN GET

01:56:38.458 --> 01:56:40.960
MORE FROM AN ISR RULE. SO THE

01:56:41.027 --> 01:56:42.595
REASON WHY, AS THE LEGISLATURE

01:56:42.662 --> 01:56:45.164
WE'RE STEPPING IN, IS TO CODIFY

01:56:45.231 --> 01:56:47.800
AND TO SAY, HE SAID HE WANTS TO

01:56:47.867 --> 01:56:49.569
WORK TOGETHER, LET'S WORK

01:56:49.635 --> 01:56:50.770
TOGETHER. THAT'S WHAT THAT'S

01:56:50.837 --> 01:56:53.539
WHAT THIS BILL SAYS, IS THAT

01:56:53.606 --> 01:56:56.042
STAKEHOLDERS, WORKERS, TERMINAL

01:56:56.109 --> 01:56:58.811
OPERATORS, VESSELS, AIR QUALITY

01:56:58.878 --> 01:57:00.313
DISTRICT WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY

01:57:00.380 --> 01:57:02.548
TO COME TOGETHER AND TO

01:57:02.615 --> 01:57:04.083
DETERMINE THE PLAN. AND ONE OF

01:57:04.150 --> 01:57:06.853
THE KEY POINTS OF THAT PLAN

01:57:06.919 --> 01:57:09.689
REQUIRED THE PORTS TO PREPARE

01:57:09.756 --> 01:57:11.824
ASSESSMENTS OF ENERGY DEMAND AND

01:57:11.891 --> 01:57:14.394
SUPPLY COST ESTIMATES, FUNDING

01:57:14.460 --> 01:57:16.195
SOURCES, WORKFORCE AND

01:57:16.262 --> 01:57:17.630
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. IT'S IN

01:57:17.697 --> 01:57:19.866
THE BILL. NO ONE'S SAYING THAT

01:57:19.932 --> 01:57:21.701
THEY WILL NOT BE AT THE TABLE.

01:57:21.768 --> 01:57:23.369
THEY WILL DEFINITELY BE AT THE

01:57:23.436 --> 01:57:24.837
TABLE. BUT EVERYONE NEEDS TO BE

01:57:24.904 --> 01:57:27.039
AT THE TABLE THAT HAS THE

01:57:27.106 --> 01:57:28.408
ABILITY TO RESOLVE THE ISSUES.

01:57:28.474 --> 01:57:31.043
THEN FINAL QUESTION, AND THIS

01:57:31.110 --> 01:57:32.578
RELATED TO ANOTHER CONCERN THAT

01:57:32.645 --> 01:57:34.881
WAS RAISED AROUND POTENTIALLY

01:57:34.947 --> 01:57:38.117
TRIGGERING FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT

01:57:38.184 --> 01:57:40.319
SANCTIONS. THROUGH THIS COURSE

01:57:40.386 --> 01:57:44.323
OF ACTION. SO MY QUESTION IS, IN

01:57:44.390 --> 01:57:47.493
EFFECT, WILL THIS IMPACT

01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:49.962
CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO MEET

01:57:50.029 --> 01:57:52.498
CLEAN AIR TARGETS, WHICH MAY

01:57:52.565 --> 01:57:54.367
RESULT IN SANCTIONS BY THE

01:57:54.434 --> 01:57:57.537
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT? CAN YOU

01:57:57.603 --> 01:57:59.839
SPEAK TO THOSE CONCERNS THAT

01:57:59.906 --> 01:58:01.774
WERE RAISED? WELL, FIRST OF ALL,

01:58:01.841 --> 01:58:03.009
THE AIR QUALITY DISTRICT HAS

01:58:03.075 --> 01:58:05.878
TALKED ABOUT THIS SINCE 2017.

01:58:05.945 --> 01:58:07.513
YOU KNOW WHAT'S KIND OF IRONIC?

01:58:07.580 --> 01:58:09.916
A COUPLE WEEKS AGO, THE

01:58:09.982 --> 01:58:12.418
ADMINISTRATION ALREADY TOOK AWAY

01:58:12.485 --> 01:58:15.688
OUR THEY SUSPENDED OUR LOW, LOW

01:58:15.755 --> 01:58:16.722
FUEL STANDARDS. THEY ALREADY DID

01:58:16.789 --> 01:58:20.726
IT BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATION

01:58:20.793 --> 01:58:22.462
SAID SOME OF CALIFORNIA'S

01:58:22.528 --> 01:58:24.597
STANDARDS ARE TOO FAR. IT'S NOT

01:58:24.664 --> 01:58:27.066
A IT'S NOT A DISCUSSION OF THEM

01:58:27.133 --> 01:58:28.568
SAYING, OH, YOU'RE GOING TOO

01:58:28.634 --> 01:58:30.336
FAR. WE NEED TO PULL YOU BACK.

01:58:30.403 --> 01:58:32.205
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ALREADY

01:58:32.271 --> 01:58:34.474
SAID TWO WEEKS AGO YOUR

01:58:34.540 --> 01:58:36.943
STANDARDS ARE TOO EXCESSIVE. AND

01:58:37.009 --> 01:58:37.944
SO WE'RE ELIMINATING THEM. AND

01:58:38.010 --> 01:58:40.980
THEY DID THAT, AND THEY DID IT

01:58:41.047 --> 01:58:42.615
BECAUSE OF A LACK OF PLANNING

01:58:42.682 --> 01:58:44.016
AND LACK OF GETTING IT DONE. SO

01:58:44.083 --> 01:58:48.120
WHAT SB 34 DOES IS IT SAYS WE'RE

01:58:48.187 --> 01:58:49.555
GOING TO MEET THESE GOALS.

01:58:49.622 --> 01:58:51.224
THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE THAT

01:58:51.290 --> 01:58:53.059
SAYS WE ARE NOT COMMITTED, ALL

01:58:53.125 --> 01:58:54.827
THE STAKEHOLDERS TO MEET THE

01:58:54.894 --> 01:58:57.096
GOALS. IN FACT, THEY SAY 2030

01:58:57.163 --> 01:59:00.533
AND 2035. SO WE'RE FULLY ON

01:59:00.600 --> 01:59:02.335
BOARD TO DO THAT. WHAT THE

01:59:02.401 --> 01:59:04.670
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS DONE HAS

01:59:04.737 --> 01:59:06.672
SAID GROUPS LIKE THE AIR QUALITY

01:59:06.739 --> 01:59:08.641
MANAGEMENT DISTRICT HAVE GONE

01:59:08.708 --> 01:59:09.909
TOO FAR. THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE

01:59:09.976 --> 01:59:10.710
DONE WELL, AND THEY CAME OUT

01:59:10.776 --> 01:59:13.746
WITH THAT 2 OR 3 WEEKS AGO.

01:59:13.813 --> 01:59:14.847
YEAH. NO, I GET THAT. THIS SEEMS

01:59:14.914 --> 01:59:16.415
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THOUGH,

01:59:16.482 --> 01:59:18.651
IN THAT IT WOULD BE BASICALLY AN

01:59:18.718 --> 01:59:20.453
ARGUMENT THAT WE'RE NOT MEETING

01:59:20.520 --> 01:59:22.555
FEDERAL STANDARDS. I CAN ONLY

01:59:22.622 --> 01:59:24.323
IMAGINE THIS ADMINISTRATION

01:59:24.390 --> 01:59:27.560
WOULD CERTAINLY POUNCE ON THAT

01:59:27.627 --> 01:59:30.796
OPPORTUNITY TO BLACKEN OUR EYE,

01:59:30.863 --> 01:59:31.931
IF YOU WILL. SO THAT'S A LITTLE

01:59:31.998 --> 01:59:34.033
BIT DIFFERENT THAN I THINK THE

01:59:34.100 --> 01:59:37.370
EXAMPLE YOU GAVE. MAYBE. LET ME

01:59:37.436 --> 01:59:39.539
CLARIFY AGAIN. THERE'S NOTHING

01:59:39.605 --> 01:59:42.441
IN HERE THAT SAYS THAT THE PORTS

01:59:42.508 --> 01:59:44.477
ARE REFUSING TO MEET THE GOALS

01:59:44.544 --> 01:59:46.646
IN THE STANDARDS, EITHER ON THE

01:59:46.712 --> 01:59:48.214
FEDERAL OR THE STATE LEVEL.

01:59:48.281 --> 01:59:50.650
THERE'S NOTHING IN SB 34 THAT

01:59:50.716 --> 01:59:52.885
SAYS THERE'S NOT THE DESIRE TO

01:59:52.952 --> 01:59:56.155
DO SO. IN FACT, SINCE 2007, WHEN

01:59:56.222 --> 01:59:57.790
I SAT ON THE CITY COUNCIL, THE

01:59:57.857 --> 02:00:00.660
PORTS HAVE WORKED VOLUNTARILY,

02:00:00.726 --> 02:00:02.929
NOT BY A STICK. AND HE KNOWS IT.

02:00:02.995 --> 02:00:04.730
YOU SAW HIM JUST JUST NOD HIS

02:00:04.797 --> 02:00:06.866
HEAD. THEY HAVE VOLUNTARILY

02:00:06.933 --> 02:00:10.369
WORKED SINCE 2007 TO ADDRESS THE

02:00:10.436 --> 02:00:13.339
TARGETS AND GOALS, BOTH STATE,

02:00:13.406 --> 02:00:15.241
LOCAL AND FEDERAL. AND THERE'S

02:00:15.308 --> 02:00:17.410
NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT WOULD

02:00:17.476 --> 02:00:19.445
SUGGEST THEY WOULD NOT WORK

02:00:19.512 --> 02:00:21.180
TOWARDS DOING THAT. WHAT IT'S

02:00:21.247 --> 02:00:24.483
SAYING IS, IS THAT THE

02:00:24.550 --> 02:00:25.618
STAKEHOLDERS KNOW BEST HOW TO

02:00:25.685 --> 02:00:28.554
MEET THOSE GOALS. AND THE NUMBER

02:00:28.621 --> 02:00:30.423
ONE GOAL THAT WE HAVE TO

02:00:30.489 --> 02:00:32.825
ACHIEVE, FRANKLY, IS

02:00:32.892 --> 02:00:33.993
ELECTRIFICATION. NOW, THE PERSON

02:00:34.060 --> 02:00:35.328
HERE FROM THE AIR QUALITY

02:00:35.394 --> 02:00:36.729
DISTRICT SAID LONG BEACH HAS

02:00:36.796 --> 02:00:39.332
DONE IT. YOU KNOW WHY LONG BEACH

02:00:39.398 --> 02:00:40.466
HAS DONE IT? IT HAS ONE

02:00:40.533 --> 02:00:43.202
ELECTRICAL SOURCE, SOUTHERN

02:00:43.269 --> 02:00:45.004
CALIFORNIA EDISON. THE PORT OF

02:00:45.071 --> 02:00:47.506
LONG BEACH HAS TWO, AND THE

02:00:47.573 --> 02:00:50.776
BIGGEST LION'S SHARE IS FRANKLY,

02:00:50.843 --> 02:00:52.111
LADWP. AND FOR THE REASONS I

02:00:52.178 --> 02:00:54.714
ALREADY GAVE YOU, WE'RE STILL

02:00:54.780 --> 02:00:57.149
WAITING ON SOMETHING FROM DWP.

02:00:57.216 --> 02:01:02.622
NOW I'M PREPARED TO WORK WITH.

02:01:02.688 --> 02:01:06.292
THE INDIVIDUALS HERE TO BUILD

02:01:06.359 --> 02:01:08.127
UPON THIS INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN.

02:01:08.194 --> 02:01:10.296
THIS ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN,

02:01:10.363 --> 02:01:11.931
AND TO MAKE SURE ANY AND EVERY

02:01:11.998 --> 02:01:13.899
GROUP THAT NEEDS TO DO ITS PART

02:01:13.966 --> 02:01:16.435
SO WE CAN MEET OUR GOALS DOES

02:01:16.502 --> 02:01:19.872
SO, AND I'LL ABSOLUTELY DO THAT.

02:01:19.939 --> 02:01:21.407
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM

02:01:21.474 --> 02:01:23.442
COLLEAGUES? MR. MURATSUCHI, YOU

02:01:23.509 --> 02:01:26.245
ALREADY HAD A CRACK AT THIS. I

02:01:26.312 --> 02:01:28.514
APPRECIATE THE CHAIR'S

02:01:28.581 --> 02:01:34.954
INDULGENCE. SENATOR. I, I DO

02:01:35.021 --> 02:01:37.923
SHARE THE CONCERN ABOUT THE

02:01:37.990 --> 02:01:40.393
LANGUAGE, IMPOSE A CAP ON CARGO

02:01:40.459 --> 02:01:42.528
THROUGHPUT AT THE PORTS,

02:01:42.595 --> 02:01:44.363
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY. I CAN

02:01:44.430 --> 02:01:47.033
SEE HOW THE AMBIGUITY OF THE

02:01:47.099 --> 02:01:52.605
TERM INDIRECTLY CAN OPEN UP THE

02:01:52.672 --> 02:01:55.541
AQMD TO LITIGATION. WILL YOU

02:01:55.608 --> 02:01:58.077
COMMIT TO ADDRESSING THAT IN THE

02:01:58.144 --> 02:01:59.879
TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE?

02:01:59.945 --> 02:02:01.414
ABSOLUTELY. AND IN FACT, IT'S MY

02:02:01.480 --> 02:02:02.448
UNDERSTANDING THE COMMITTEE

02:02:02.515 --> 02:02:05.685
STAFF HAS ALREADY MET WITH TWO

02:02:05.751 --> 02:02:07.019
OF THE GROUPS AND HAS STATED

02:02:07.086 --> 02:02:09.288
THAT THEY WERE GOING TO WORK ON

02:02:09.355 --> 02:02:10.656
THAT PARTICULAR PORTION, AND I

02:02:10.723 --> 02:02:12.458
REMAIN AVAILABLE TO DO SO.

02:02:12.525 --> 02:02:14.994
ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU. WE DO

02:02:15.061 --> 02:02:16.796
HAVE THAT COMMITMENT. ANY OTHER

02:02:16.862 --> 02:02:18.197
QUESTIONS FROM COLLEAGUES, MR.

02:02:18.264 --> 02:02:20.466
SCHULTZ? THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR.

02:02:20.533 --> 02:02:21.967
NOT A QUESTION, BUT I SUPPOSE

02:02:22.034 --> 02:02:23.436
THIS WOULD BE A GOOD TIME FOR

02:02:23.502 --> 02:02:24.603
COMMENT. CORRECT, MR. CHAIR?

02:02:24.670 --> 02:02:26.672
YES. THANK YOU. SENATOR, I WANT

02:02:26.739 --> 02:02:27.740
TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR

02:02:27.807 --> 02:02:28.641
PRESENTATION. I WANT TO THANK

02:02:28.708 --> 02:02:31.210
ALL OF THE WITNESSES, BOTH THOSE

02:02:31.277 --> 02:02:32.011
IN SUPPORT AND THOSE IN

02:02:32.078 --> 02:02:33.879
OPPOSITION. FOR THE SAKE OF

02:02:33.946 --> 02:02:35.514
TIME, I'LL JUST SAY THAT I HAD

02:02:35.581 --> 02:02:37.383
MANY QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS TO

02:02:37.450 --> 02:02:38.884
MAKE, AND I REALLY WANT TO ECHO

02:02:38.951 --> 02:02:40.486
THE LINE OF QUESTIONING FROM MY

02:02:40.553 --> 02:02:41.120
COLLEAGUE FROM WEST HOLLYWOOD,

02:02:41.187 --> 02:02:41.687
ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S BURR, WHO I

02:02:41.754 --> 02:02:43.456
THINK REALLY CAPTURED MOST OF

02:02:43.522 --> 02:02:45.691
WHAT I WAS GOING TO TRY TO SAY.

02:02:45.758 --> 02:02:47.326
I JUST WANTED TO EXPLAIN MY VOTE

02:02:47.393 --> 02:02:49.628
BEFORE I CAST IT. I WILL BE

02:02:49.695 --> 02:02:50.296
SUPPORTING THE RECOMMENDATION OF

02:02:50.362 --> 02:02:51.597
THE CHAIR, AND FOR ME, IT'S A

02:02:51.664 --> 02:02:53.499
MATTER OF PROCESS. I DON'T THINK

02:02:53.566 --> 02:02:54.500
THAT THIS BILL IS FULLY THERE

02:02:54.567 --> 02:02:56.469
YET, AND I'LL BE VERY CANDID.

02:02:56.535 --> 02:02:57.870
WHEN I SAW THE ORIGINAL

02:02:57.937 --> 02:02:59.405
ITERATION OF THE BILL, I HAD

02:02:59.472 --> 02:03:00.506
VERY DEEP CONCERNS. MR. CHAIR, I

02:03:00.573 --> 02:03:02.007
THINK YOU AND THE COMMITTEE

02:03:02.074 --> 02:03:03.676
STAFF DID A PHENOMENAL JOB OF

02:03:03.743 --> 02:03:04.543
REALLY WINNOWING THIS DOWN TO

02:03:04.610 --> 02:03:06.545
WHAT IS THE CRUX OF THE ISSUE,

02:03:06.612 --> 02:03:07.713
WHAT WAS THE AUTHOR'S STATED

02:03:07.780 --> 02:03:09.315
INTENT AND HOW DO WE ACCOMPLISH

02:03:09.381 --> 02:03:11.250
THAT? WE ALL KNOW THAT WE NEED

02:03:11.317 --> 02:03:11.984
TO DECARBONIZE OUR ECONOMY, BUT

02:03:12.051 --> 02:03:14.353
WE NEED TO DO IT IN A WAY WHERE

02:03:14.420 --> 02:03:15.554
WE BRING OUR WORKFORCE ALONG

02:03:15.621 --> 02:03:17.456
WITH US. AND STRIKING THAT RIGHT

02:03:17.523 --> 02:03:18.591
BALANCE IS WHAT I THINK THIS

02:03:18.657 --> 02:03:20.025
BILL HOPES TO DO. SO I

02:03:20.092 --> 02:03:20.960
UNDERSTAND, AS YOU MENTIONED,

02:03:21.026 --> 02:03:22.828
SENATOR, THIS IS GOING TO GO TO

02:03:22.895 --> 02:03:23.596
TRANSPORTATION. I BELIEVE IT

02:03:23.662 --> 02:03:25.731
MIGHT BE MARKED FISCAL. SO IT

02:03:25.798 --> 02:03:27.433
MIGHT BE GOING TO A PROPS. THIS

02:03:27.500 --> 02:03:28.367
BILL WILL PROBABLY CHANGE. I'M

02:03:28.434 --> 02:03:30.870
NOT SAYING HOW I'LL VOTE ON THE

02:03:30.936 --> 02:03:31.470
FLOOR TODAY, BUT MY VOTE IS

02:03:31.537 --> 02:03:33.372
QUITE SIMPLE. SHOULD WE END THE

02:03:33.439 --> 02:03:33.939
CONVERSATION TODAY? I DON'T

02:03:34.006 --> 02:03:35.808
THINK SO. I THINK THIS IS TOO

02:03:35.875 --> 02:03:37.510
IMPORTANT AN ISSUE. WE HAVE TO

02:03:37.576 --> 02:03:38.644
CONTINUE IT MOVING FORWARD. SO I

02:03:38.711 --> 02:03:40.980
WILL BE VOTING AYE TODAY, AND I

02:03:41.046 --> 02:03:42.915
TAKE YOU AT YOUR WORD AND I

02:03:42.982 --> 02:03:44.016
ENCOURAGE YOU TO WORK WITH THE

02:03:44.083 --> 02:03:45.417
OPPOSITION. AND IF THERE IS MORE

02:03:45.484 --> 02:03:46.819
COMMON GROUND TO BE FOUND,

02:03:46.886 --> 02:03:48.087
THAT'S GREAT. THE LAST POINT

02:03:48.154 --> 02:03:49.789
I'LL MAKE IS, SIR, I UNDERSTAND

02:03:49.855 --> 02:03:51.090
YOUR CONCERN ABOUT PRECEDENTS. I

02:03:51.157 --> 02:03:51.991
UNDERSTAND THE SENATOR'S

02:03:52.057 --> 02:03:53.559
RESPONSE TO THAT. MY ONLY

02:03:53.626 --> 02:03:54.827
ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE TWO OF YOU

02:03:54.894 --> 02:03:56.695
IS THAT IF WE'RE NOT GOING TO

02:03:56.762 --> 02:03:58.364
MOVE PAST THAT POINT IN THIS

02:03:58.430 --> 02:03:59.765
CONVERSATION, YOU'RE GOING TO BE

02:03:59.832 --> 02:04:01.066
RIGHT BACK HERE IN

02:04:01.133 --> 02:04:01.467
TRANSPORTATION AND

02:04:01.534 --> 02:04:02.134
APPROPRIATIONS. I WOULD STRONGLY

02:04:02.201 --> 02:04:03.435
ENCOURAGE YOU TO GET TOGETHER

02:04:03.502 --> 02:04:04.670
AND TALK, AS MY COLLEAGUE

02:04:04.737 --> 02:04:05.471
MENTIONED, ABOUT A MATTER OF

02:04:05.538 --> 02:04:06.839
POLICY, BECAUSE MOST OF WHAT

02:04:06.906 --> 02:04:08.707
THIS BILL DOES, I TAKE YOU AT

02:04:08.774 --> 02:04:10.976
YOUR WORD, SIR. IT'S WHAT SÂ¼

02:04:11.043 --> 02:04:13.112
AQMD IS ALREADY DOING. SO I

02:04:13.179 --> 02:04:14.313
ENCOURAGE ALL THE PARTIES TO

02:04:14.380 --> 02:04:15.681
CONTINUE CHATTING WITH THAT. MR.

02:04:15.748 --> 02:04:17.316
CHAIR, I WILL BE FOLLOWING YOUR

02:04:17.383 --> 02:04:19.418
RECOMMENDATION. THANK YOU SIR.

02:04:19.485 --> 02:04:20.653
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM

02:04:20.719 --> 02:04:23.289
COLLEAGUES? NOBODY ASKED TAYLOR

02:04:23.355 --> 02:04:24.824
A QUESTION THE ENTIRE TIME YOU

02:04:24.890 --> 02:04:26.425
WERE SITTING UP HERE. SO IF IT'S

02:04:26.492 --> 02:04:28.594
OKAY, I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU A

02:04:28.661 --> 02:04:30.729
QUESTION. HOW IMPORTANT IS IT TO

02:04:30.796 --> 02:04:32.598
MAINTAIN THE VOICE OF LOCAL

02:04:32.665 --> 02:04:36.836
COMMUNITIES IN THE AIR DISTRICTS

02:04:36.902 --> 02:04:43.943
RULEMAKING PROCESS? YOU KNOW, I

02:04:44.009 --> 02:04:46.879
I'M 35 YEARS OLD. I STARTED

02:04:46.946 --> 02:04:48.848
DOING THIS WORK BECAUSE I WAS

02:04:48.914 --> 02:04:50.015
BORN AND RAISED IN WEST LONG

02:04:50.082 --> 02:04:52.718
BEACH. THERE'S THE 710 FREEWAY

02:04:52.785 --> 02:04:54.954
TO THE WEST, SEVERAL REFINERIES

02:04:55.020 --> 02:04:56.488
TO THE EAST, THE 405 AND THEN

02:04:56.555 --> 02:04:58.591
THE PORTS TO THE SOUTH. I DIDN'T

02:04:58.657 --> 02:05:00.192
GET INVOLVED IN THIS WORK

02:05:00.259 --> 02:05:02.027
BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS

02:05:02.094 --> 02:05:03.863
SOMETHING WONDERFUL AND MAGICAL,

02:05:03.929 --> 02:05:05.965
AND I HAD DREAMS TO BE A

02:05:06.031 --> 02:05:06.765
PSYCHIATRIST. I WANTED TO HELP

02:05:06.832 --> 02:05:08.567
MY COMMUNITY, BUT WHEN I FOUND

02:05:08.634 --> 02:05:10.603
OUT THAT I WAS BEING DIRECTLY

02:05:10.669 --> 02:05:12.304
IMPACTED BY ALL OF THE SOURCES

02:05:12.371 --> 02:05:13.939
AROUND MY COMMUNITY, I FELT

02:05:14.006 --> 02:05:15.808
COMPELLED TO GET INVOLVED,

02:05:15.875 --> 02:05:17.042
COMPELLED TO GET INVOLVED. AND

02:05:17.109 --> 02:05:18.711
THEN I STARTED TO UNDERSTAND

02:05:18.777 --> 02:05:20.279
THAT THERE'S SEVERAL COMMUNITIES

02:05:20.346 --> 02:05:21.580
LIKE MINE ACROSS THE COUNTRY

02:05:21.647 --> 02:05:24.283
THAT WERE ALSO ADVOCATING FOR IN

02:05:24.350 --> 02:05:25.851
SAVANNAH, IN NEWARK AND NEW

02:05:25.918 --> 02:05:29.255
JERSEY. AND SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S

02:05:29.321 --> 02:05:31.590
BEEN VERY DIFFICULT TO ENGAGE IN

02:05:31.657 --> 02:05:33.759
THIS BECAUSE I'VE BEEN UP TO

02:05:33.826 --> 02:05:35.928
SACRAMENTO SEVERAL TIMES IN THE

02:05:35.995 --> 02:05:39.131
PAST 15 YEARS. HERE IN CARB, WE

02:05:39.198 --> 02:05:40.532
ENGAGE IN GOOD FAITH. EVERY

02:05:40.599 --> 02:05:43.502
PUBLIC PROCESS WE ENGAGE IN, WE

02:05:43.569 --> 02:05:45.004
COULD TURN UP AND TURN ALL THIS

02:05:45.070 --> 02:05:47.006
STUFF OUT. WE COULD BECAUSE

02:05:47.072 --> 02:05:48.841
PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY ARE DYING

02:05:48.908 --> 02:05:50.676
AND YET WE STILL SHOW UP. SOME

02:05:50.743 --> 02:05:52.845
PEOPLE DROVE SEVEN HOURS TO BE

02:05:52.912 --> 02:05:56.415
HERE TODAY, SO IT'S REALLY HARD

02:05:56.482 --> 02:05:58.684
FOR ME AND FOR US TO SIT HERE

02:05:58.751 --> 02:05:59.985
AND HEAR ALL OF THESE LIES,

02:06:00.052 --> 02:06:01.754
THESE MISTRUTHS, WHILE WE'RE

02:06:01.820 --> 02:06:03.455
FIGHTING FOR THE RIGHT TO

02:06:03.522 --> 02:06:06.392
BREATHE CLEAN AIR. RIGHT, FOLKS

02:06:06.458 --> 02:06:07.960
LIVE AND WORK IN OUR

02:06:08.027 --> 02:06:08.994
COMMUNITIES. WE'RE WORKERS TOO.

02:06:09.061 --> 02:06:11.163
WE DON'T SUPPORT AUTOMATION. WE

02:06:11.230 --> 02:06:12.398
SUPPORT PEOPLE GETTING GOOD

02:06:12.464 --> 02:06:13.699
JOBS. BUT THIS IS DEEPLY

02:06:13.766 --> 02:06:16.168
PERSONAL. WHEN YOU WATCH PEOPLE

02:06:16.235 --> 02:06:18.570
IN YOUR COMMUNITY EVERY DAY,

02:06:18.637 --> 02:06:20.806
RIGHT? AND WE SHOW UP AND WE DO

02:06:20.873 --> 02:06:23.142
THE GOOD FAITH WORK OF BEING IN

02:06:23.208 --> 02:06:24.944
THE COMMUNITY MEETINGS. WE WRITE

02:06:25.010 --> 02:06:27.279
LETTERS, WE DO OUR RESEARCH

02:06:27.346 --> 02:06:29.381
RIGHT. I DON'T HAVE GRADUATE

02:06:29.448 --> 02:06:30.683
DEGREES FOR THIS STUFF, BUT I'LL

02:06:30.749 --> 02:06:33.052
TELL YOU, I'M A LAWYER. I'M A

02:06:33.118 --> 02:06:35.587
SCIENTIST, RIGHT? I'M A REALTOR.

02:06:35.654 --> 02:06:36.622
I'M A CHEMICAL ENGINEER BECAUSE

02:06:36.689 --> 02:06:39.024
I HAD TO BE. WE HAVE TO LEARN

02:06:39.091 --> 02:06:40.726
HOW TO ENGAGE IN THIS PROCESS

02:06:40.793 --> 02:06:42.394
BECAUSE IT'S NOT EASY. AND SO IT

02:06:42.461 --> 02:06:44.563
IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THESE

02:06:44.630 --> 02:06:47.800
ISSUES ARE DECADES, DECADES THAT

02:06:47.866 --> 02:06:49.535
WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH. AND SO

02:06:49.601 --> 02:06:51.670
WAYNE WILL TELL YOU, I'M NOT HIS

02:06:51.737 --> 02:06:53.939
FRIEND. I DO NOT LIKE WAYNE. I

02:06:54.006 --> 02:06:55.975
DON'T I MEAN, YEAH, I'VE CUSSED

02:06:56.041 --> 02:06:57.876
HIS STAFF OUT. YOU KNOW, I DON'T

02:06:57.943 --> 02:06:59.778
LIKE THAT. I HAVE TO SIT UP HERE

02:06:59.845 --> 02:07:01.714
AND BE ALIGNED WITH AN AGENCY

02:07:01.780 --> 02:07:03.515
THAT HAS, IN MY OPINION, FAILED

02:07:03.582 --> 02:07:05.250
US FOR DECADES. BUT THIS IS

02:07:05.317 --> 02:07:07.953
WHERE WE'RE AT. WE ARE NOW IN A

02:07:08.020 --> 02:07:10.189
PLACE WHERE WE CAN GET

02:07:10.255 --> 02:07:11.790
SOMETHING. OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE

02:07:11.857 --> 02:07:13.625
COMPROMISED EVERYTHING,

02:07:13.692 --> 02:07:15.194
EVERYTHING. AND WE ALWAYS WALK

02:07:15.260 --> 02:07:18.097
AWAY, LEFT WITH NOTHING. SO YES,

02:07:18.163 --> 02:07:19.365
THANK YOU FOR ASKING THAT

02:07:19.431 --> 02:07:20.466
QUESTION. IT'S VERY CRITICAL

02:07:20.532 --> 02:07:22.001
BECAUSE OUR VOICES ARE OFTEN

02:07:22.067 --> 02:07:24.303
SILENCED AND SILOED. THANK YOU

02:07:24.370 --> 02:07:25.537
FOR COMING UP HERE FOR EVERYBODY

02:07:25.604 --> 02:07:27.106
WHO MADE THE TRIP. SENATOR,

02:07:27.172 --> 02:07:31.744
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE? WELL,

02:07:31.810 --> 02:07:33.479
YES, BUT I DO NEED TO RESPOND TO

02:07:33.545 --> 02:07:35.414
A COUPLE OF COMMENTS.

02:07:35.481 --> 02:07:37.016
UNFORTUNATELY, THE WITNESSES

02:07:37.082 --> 02:07:38.684
WERE AFFORDED. I THINK IT WAS AT

02:07:38.751 --> 02:07:40.386
LEAST 30 MINUTES. SO THERE'S A

02:07:40.452 --> 02:07:42.921
COUPLE OF THINGS I'D LIKE TO

02:07:42.988 --> 02:07:44.690
RESPOND TO. NUMBER ONE, WITH ALL

02:07:44.757 --> 02:07:49.361
DUE RESPECT, I CAME HERE TO

02:07:49.428 --> 02:07:50.696
SERVE THE COMMUNITY. THAT'S WHY

02:07:50.763 --> 02:07:53.665
I RAN FOR SENATE. AND I REMAIN

02:07:53.732 --> 02:07:56.869
OPEN TO WORKING WITH YOU AND ANY

02:07:56.935 --> 02:07:59.138
ORGANIZATIONS AND AGENCIES TO DO

02:07:59.204 --> 02:08:01.273
THE BEST FOR OUR COMMUNITY. BUT

02:08:01.340 --> 02:08:03.709
WHAT I DIDN'T COME HERE TO DO IS

02:08:03.776 --> 02:08:06.278
TO BE REFERRED TO AS LIES, AND

02:08:06.345 --> 02:08:08.147
CERTAINLY TO BE COMPARED TO

02:08:08.213 --> 02:08:09.748
TRUMP. AND I GOT TO TELL YOU IN

02:08:09.815 --> 02:08:11.283
A COMMITTEE, I'M A LITTLE

02:08:11.350 --> 02:08:14.520
SURPRISED TO HEAR IT. LET ME

02:08:14.586 --> 02:08:18.157
BRIEFLY SAY THAT HAVING SERVED

02:08:18.223 --> 02:08:20.692
ON TRANSPORTATION IN THE US

02:08:20.759 --> 02:08:23.562
CONGRESS, THERE ARE TWO FORMS

02:08:23.629 --> 02:08:25.964
THAT WE CAN WORK WITH. THERE'S

02:08:26.031 --> 02:08:30.569
INTRA AND THERE'S INTERSTATE I.

02:08:30.636 --> 02:08:35.774
TÃ Ã INTERSTATE INTRASTATE HAS

02:08:35.841 --> 02:08:37.409
TO DO WITH ANY OF THE ACTIVITY

02:08:37.476 --> 02:08:41.513
WITHIN THE STATE. INTERSTATE

02:08:41.580 --> 02:08:44.383
DOES NOT WORK WITH VESSELS. WE

02:08:44.450 --> 02:08:47.986
DO NOT CONTROL VESSELS.

02:08:48.053 --> 02:08:50.489
INTERSTATE DOES NOT. SO WHEN WE

02:08:50.556 --> 02:08:53.025
SAY IT'S NOT IN OUR CONTROL,

02:08:53.092 --> 02:08:56.662
THERE'S NO EXCUSE, THERE'S NO

02:08:56.728 --> 02:08:58.530
BLAMING, THERE'S NO LYING. I'M

02:08:58.597 --> 02:09:03.869
TELLING YOU WHAT INTERSTATE IS.

02:09:03.936 --> 02:09:05.637
INTERSTATE. SOUTH COAST AIR

02:09:05.704 --> 02:09:07.506
QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT DOES

02:09:07.573 --> 02:09:11.343
NOT HAVE THE ABILITY INTERSTATE

02:09:11.410 --> 02:09:14.680
TO SHUT DOWN A HIGHWAY AND TO

02:09:14.746 --> 02:09:18.250
SAY TRUCKS, YOU CAN ONLY RUN

02:09:18.317 --> 02:09:21.854
FROM 9 TO 10 AT NIGHT.

02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:24.823
INTERSTATE AND INTRASTATE ARE

02:09:24.890 --> 02:09:26.992
DIFFERENT FORMS, AND WE HAVE TO

02:09:27.059 --> 02:09:29.128
OPERATE WITHIN OUR LANES. SO

02:09:29.194 --> 02:09:32.331
NOTHING IS INTENDED TO SAY WE'RE

02:09:32.397 --> 02:09:34.099
NOT RESPONSIBLE. WE DON'T WANT

02:09:34.166 --> 02:09:35.534
TO BE RESPONSIBLE. WE'RE NOT

02:09:35.601 --> 02:09:38.470
GOING TO WORK TO DO EVERYTHING,

02:09:38.537 --> 02:09:39.771
TO BE RESPONSIBLE. I WAS ON THE

02:09:39.838 --> 02:09:41.640
CITY COUNCIL WHEN WE SET UP THE

02:09:41.707 --> 02:09:44.309
AFTER HOURS PROGRAM. SO INSTEAD

02:09:44.376 --> 02:09:48.547
OF RUNNING FROM 8 TO 5:00, WHEN

02:09:48.614 --> 02:09:50.482
KIDS ARE IN SCHOOL AND THE

02:09:50.549 --> 02:09:51.850
TRUCKS ARE GOING BY, WE WERE

02:09:51.917 --> 02:09:53.986
LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS

02:09:54.052 --> 02:09:55.287
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. THREE

02:09:55.354 --> 02:09:56.822
SHIFTS. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

02:09:56.889 --> 02:09:57.923
THAT WE'RE RUNNING IN THE

02:09:57.990 --> 02:09:59.258
EVENING TIME WHEN THE VOLUMES

02:09:59.324 --> 02:10:01.593
WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGH. SO WE

02:10:01.660 --> 02:10:03.962
HAVE THE ABILITY TO WORK WITH

02:10:04.029 --> 02:10:06.331
TRUCKS. BUT INTERSTATE SHUTTING

02:10:06.398 --> 02:10:09.034
DOWN A HIGHWAY, INTERSTATE

02:10:09.101 --> 02:10:12.938
WORKING WITH A VESSEL, THOSE ARE

02:10:13.005 --> 02:10:15.741
FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. THOSE ARE

02:10:15.807 --> 02:10:18.377
NOT STATE REQUIREMENTS. SO WHEN

02:10:18.443 --> 02:10:20.679
WE SAY IT'S OUT OF OUR CONTROL,

02:10:20.746 --> 02:10:22.381
WE'RE NOT SAYING WE DON'T WANT

02:10:22.447 --> 02:10:24.383
TO WORK ON IT. WE'RE SAYING WE

02:10:24.449 --> 02:10:26.285
HAVE LIMITATIONS OF WHAT WE CAN

02:10:26.351 --> 02:10:30.189
DO NOW. ELECTRIFICATION I

02:10:30.255 --> 02:10:33.425
MENTIONED LA, DWP, SOUTHERN

02:10:33.492 --> 02:10:35.360
CALIFORNIA EDISON. I BELIEVE

02:10:35.427 --> 02:10:36.562
EVERYONE HERE IN THIS ROOM KNOWS

02:10:36.628 --> 02:10:38.430
THAT THEY HAVE THEIR HANDS FULL

02:10:38.497 --> 02:10:39.998
WITH WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE

02:10:40.065 --> 02:10:42.434
FIRE AND REIMBURSEMENT. SO OUR

02:10:42.501 --> 02:10:43.635
BEST GUESS IS GOING TO BE

02:10:43.702 --> 02:10:46.905
PROBABLY THROUGH LA, DWP AND I

02:10:46.972 --> 02:10:49.007
STAND READY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:10:49.074 --> 02:10:52.211
IN FACT DO ADOPT A ENERGY

02:10:52.277 --> 02:10:53.612
PROGRAM THAT IS GOING TO HELP US

02:10:53.679 --> 02:10:55.981
TO MAKE SURE WE GET TO ZERO

02:10:56.048 --> 02:10:58.383
EMISSIONS. AND THEN IT WAS ASKED

02:10:58.450 --> 02:11:01.587
ABOUT DIVERSIONS. I'M SITTING ON

02:11:01.653 --> 02:11:03.689
A OIL WORKING GROUP HERE IN THE

02:11:03.755 --> 02:11:08.026
SENATE. 75% OF OUR CRUDE OIL IS

02:11:08.093 --> 02:11:14.266
COMING FROM IMPORTS, 75%, 25% OF

02:11:14.333 --> 02:11:16.134
GASOLINE IS COMING THROUGH

02:11:16.201 --> 02:11:18.170
IMPORTS. YOU JUST HEARD THE

02:11:18.237 --> 02:11:21.306
AGENCY SAY, WE DON'T TRACK

02:11:21.373 --> 02:11:24.676
WHAT'S NOT COMING IN CALIFORNIA.

02:11:24.743 --> 02:11:27.246
WHICH ONE OF YOU HERE ON THE

02:11:27.312 --> 02:11:29.314
NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE

02:11:29.381 --> 02:11:32.918
THINKS IT'S OKAY? OH, LET'S

02:11:32.985 --> 02:11:34.052
BYPASS CALIFORNIA. BUT WE'RE

02:11:34.119 --> 02:11:36.455
GOING TO NOW DUMP ON ARIZONA AND

02:11:36.521 --> 02:11:39.858
NEVADA AND EVERY PLACE ELSE. I

02:11:39.925 --> 02:11:40.492
DIDN'T RECALL SEEING THAT THAT

02:11:40.559 --> 02:11:44.029
WAS THE WORK THAT YOU DO. 75%.

02:11:44.096 --> 02:11:46.265
AND OH, BY THE WAY, IT'S

02:11:46.331 --> 02:11:48.333
PROBABLY GOING TO GET WORSE.

02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:50.135
WE'RE PROBABLY LOOKING AT

02:11:50.202 --> 02:11:53.939
DOUBLING THE FUEL OF GASOLINE TO

02:11:54.006 --> 02:11:56.008
50%. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

02:11:56.074 --> 02:11:57.643
DIVERSION, DIVERSION IS

02:11:57.709 --> 02:11:58.844
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST

02:11:58.910 --> 02:12:01.046
ENOUGH TO SAY I DON'T WANT IT IN

02:12:01.113 --> 02:12:02.514
MY BACKYARD. IT'S ENOUGH TO SAY,

02:12:02.581 --> 02:12:04.182
LET'S FIX THE PROBLEM. AND HOW

02:12:04.249 --> 02:12:06.018
WE'RE GOING TO FIX THE PROBLEM

02:12:06.084 --> 02:12:08.053
IS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THOSE

02:12:08.120 --> 02:12:11.590
VESSELS PLUG IN. FINALLY, I JUST

02:12:11.657 --> 02:12:14.293
WANT TO SPEAK TO THE AMENDMENTS

02:12:14.359 --> 02:12:17.663
THEMSELVES AND TO THE STAFF THAT

02:12:17.729 --> 02:12:22.234
WORKED SO INCREDIBLY HARD. THIS

02:12:22.301 --> 02:12:25.137
BILL, SB 34, AND MR. CONNELLY

02:12:25.203 --> 02:12:27.706
ASKED THIS QUESTION WHY DID I

02:12:27.773 --> 02:12:30.475
AUTHOR SB 34, WHY ARE WE HERE

02:12:30.542 --> 02:12:31.710
TODAY? WE'RE HERE TODAY BECAUSE

02:12:31.777 --> 02:12:34.146
WE CANNOT WAIT ANOTHER SEVEN

02:12:34.212 --> 02:12:36.815
YEARS OR TEN YEARS TO FIX THIS

02:12:36.882 --> 02:12:39.384
PROBLEM. WE NEED IN SEVEN YEARS

02:12:39.451 --> 02:12:42.788
AND TEN YEARS TO HAVE MET THOSE

02:12:42.854 --> 02:12:43.822
EMISSION GOALS. AND THE BEST WAY

02:12:43.889 --> 02:12:45.557
WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT IS NOT

02:12:45.624 --> 02:12:47.893
WITH THE STICK, BUT WITH

02:12:47.959 --> 02:12:50.395
EVERYONE, INCLUDING COMMUNITY

02:12:50.462 --> 02:12:51.963
ORGANIZATIONS WORKING TOGETHER

02:12:52.030 --> 02:12:53.699
AND SAYING, WE ARE GOING TO MEET

02:12:53.765 --> 02:12:55.701
THESE GOALS. THIS IS HOW WE'RE

02:12:55.767 --> 02:12:57.569
GOING TO MEET THESE GOALS, AND

02:12:57.636 --> 02:13:00.038
THEN WE TRACK THEM TO THEM. MY

02:13:00.105 --> 02:13:01.506
COMMITMENT AS THE AUTHOR IS TO

02:13:01.573 --> 02:13:03.875
WORK WITH THE AGENCY AND ALL

02:13:03.942 --> 02:13:06.044
AGENCIES TO WORK WITH AMENDMENTS

02:13:06.111 --> 02:13:08.613
SHOULD THEY COME FORWARD. AND MY

02:13:08.680 --> 02:13:10.015
COMMITMENT IS, IS TO MAKE SURE,

02:13:10.082 --> 02:13:12.117
AS A PART OF THIS COMMITTEE THAT

02:13:12.184 --> 02:13:13.985
YOU SEE IMPROVEMENTS OVER THE

02:13:14.052 --> 02:13:15.821
NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS AS WE

02:13:15.887 --> 02:13:17.556
ACHIEVE THESE GOALS. AND WITH

02:13:17.622 --> 02:13:19.758
THAT, I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A

02:13:19.825 --> 02:13:22.327
MOTION AND ALSO FOR YOUR AYE

02:13:22.394 --> 02:13:24.496
VOTE. THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE A

02:13:24.563 --> 02:13:27.366
MOTION? MOTION BY MR. ELLIS.

02:13:27.432 --> 02:13:29.134
SECOND. SECOND BY MR.

02:13:29.201 --> 02:13:32.371
MURATSUCHI. AYE, SENATOR. I KNOW

02:13:32.437 --> 02:13:34.139
THIS IS YOUR FIRST TIME TO THIS

02:13:34.206 --> 02:13:35.841
COMMITTEE. FOR THOSE WHO HAVE

02:13:35.907 --> 02:13:37.376
BEEN HERE ALL YEAR, I HOLD A

02:13:37.442 --> 02:13:39.411
PRETTY TIGHT GRIP ON IT. ONE OF

02:13:39.478 --> 02:13:41.646
THE THINGS I DON'T DO, THOUGH,

02:13:41.713 --> 02:13:43.281
IS, IS TELL COMMUNITY HOW TO

02:13:43.348 --> 02:13:45.484
ADDRESS US. BECAUSE, LIKE YOU, I

02:13:45.550 --> 02:13:47.285
THINK I WAS REFERRED TO AS ICE

02:13:47.352 --> 02:13:48.553
AT ONE POINT IN THE TESTIMONY.

02:13:48.620 --> 02:13:50.122
AND I THINK THAT'S LARGELY

02:13:50.188 --> 02:13:50.822
BECAUSE WHEN YOU'VE BEEN

02:13:50.889 --> 02:13:51.757
DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY HARMS AND

02:13:51.823 --> 02:13:55.460
YOU COME TO PLACES LIKE THIS.

02:13:55.527 --> 02:13:57.195
ALL YOU KNOW IS HOW TO TRANSLATE

02:13:57.262 --> 02:13:58.730
THAT HARM FROM COMMUNITY INTO

02:13:58.797 --> 02:14:00.532
THE WAY THAT YOU ADDRESS THE

02:14:00.599 --> 02:14:02.667
BODY. AND SO I LET IT ROLL OFF

02:14:02.734 --> 02:14:04.903
OF ME PERSONALLY AND TRY TO

02:14:04.970 --> 02:14:05.537
LISTEN TO THE SUBSTANCE. AND I

02:14:05.604 --> 02:14:07.239
WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE

02:14:07.305 --> 02:14:07.839
COMMUNITY ADVOCATES WHO MADE

02:14:07.906 --> 02:14:09.875
THEIR WAY UP HERE, ESPECIALLY IF

02:14:09.941 --> 02:14:10.942
YOU CAME ALL THE WAY FROM LONG

02:14:11.009 --> 02:14:12.644
BEACH AND SAN PEDRO. I WANT TO

02:14:12.711 --> 02:14:14.212
THANK THE SENATOR FOR WORKING

02:14:14.279 --> 02:14:15.714
WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE

02:14:15.781 --> 02:14:17.015
LAST SEVERAL WEEKS AND ILWU, I

02:14:17.082 --> 02:14:18.884
THINK AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA

02:14:18.950 --> 02:14:19.651
MONICA MENTIONED, THIS BILL HAS

02:14:19.718 --> 02:14:21.586
BEEN TRIMMED DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY

02:14:21.653 --> 02:14:24.289
TO FOCUS ON THE KIND OF TWO KEY

02:14:24.356 --> 02:14:27.759
AREAS OF HONESTLY DISTRUST, AND

02:14:27.826 --> 02:14:29.995
THAT IS THAT THE RULEMAKING

02:14:30.061 --> 02:14:32.130
PROCESS WILL RESULT IN

02:14:32.197 --> 02:14:35.367
AUTOMATION AND CARGO LIMITS. AND

02:14:35.434 --> 02:14:37.135
AS WAS MENTIONED BY AQMD, THEY

02:14:37.202 --> 02:14:39.070
HAVE NO INTEREST IN SETTING

02:14:39.137 --> 02:14:41.573
CARGO LIMITS OR ELECTRIFYING.

02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:43.108
THAT'S ALL THE BILL ADDRESSES

02:14:43.175 --> 02:14:45.844
ARE NOT ELECTRIFYING. WE HAVE A

02:14:45.911 --> 02:14:47.012
DEEP INTEREST IN

02:14:47.078 --> 02:14:48.880
ELECTRIFICATION, AUTOMATION.

02:14:48.947 --> 02:14:50.182
THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO THINGS

02:14:50.248 --> 02:14:52.250
LEFT IN THIS BILL. THIS BILL IS

02:14:52.317 --> 02:14:54.252
NECESSARY BECAUSE THE DISTRUST

02:14:54.319 --> 02:14:56.521
IS THAT HIGH. AND LIKE MY

02:14:56.588 --> 02:14:57.389
COLLEAGUE FROM BURBANK

02:14:57.456 --> 02:14:58.924
MENTIONED, I'D LIKE NOT TO SEE

02:14:58.990 --> 02:15:01.760
BILLS LIKE THIS. I THINK THAT

02:15:01.827 --> 02:15:03.195
LOCAL AUTHORITIES THAT ARE

02:15:03.261 --> 02:15:04.663
CLOSEST TO THE PEOPLE CLOSEST TO

02:15:04.729 --> 02:15:05.931
THE GROUND ARE THE CLOSEST TO

02:15:05.997 --> 02:15:07.499
THE SOLUTIONS, AND THAT INCLUDES

02:15:07.566 --> 02:15:09.935
THE AIR MANAGEMENT DISTRICTS,

02:15:10.001 --> 02:15:11.102
AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICTS

02:15:11.169 --> 02:15:13.004
THAT HAVE HELD MANY WORKSHOPS

02:15:13.071 --> 02:15:15.440
AND MANY COMMUNITY CONVENINGS.

02:15:15.507 --> 02:15:16.808
HOWEVER, WE'RE AT A SITUATION

02:15:16.875 --> 02:15:18.610
NOW, AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED,

02:15:18.677 --> 02:15:19.744
WHERE THE DISTRUST IS BUILT TO

02:15:19.811 --> 02:15:21.646
THE FACT THAT IT HAS REACHED THE

02:15:21.713 --> 02:15:22.747
LEGISLATURE. AND IF THE QUESTION

02:15:22.814 --> 02:15:23.882
IS WHETHER WE CAN SUPERSEDE THAT

02:15:23.949 --> 02:15:24.749
LOCAL AUTHORITY OR NOT, THE

02:15:24.816 --> 02:15:27.953
ANSWER IS YES, AND WE WILL IF WE

02:15:28.019 --> 02:15:30.121
HAVE TO. BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT

02:15:30.188 --> 02:15:32.257
A PRACTICE THAT THIS COMMITTEE

02:15:32.324 --> 02:15:35.126
PLANS ON NORMALIZING. IT'S NOT

02:15:35.193 --> 02:15:36.728
SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE THIS

02:15:36.795 --> 02:15:38.363
BILL WILL SET A PRECEDENT FOR,

02:15:38.430 --> 02:15:40.198
BECAUSE IT DOES NOT STRIP THE

02:15:40.265 --> 02:15:41.533
AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT

02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:43.735
OF ANY RULEMAKING AUTHORITY THAT

02:15:43.802 --> 02:15:46.271
IT HASN'T ALREADY ARTICULATED IN

02:15:46.338 --> 02:15:47.906
PUBLIC THAT IT HAS NO DESIRE TO

02:15:47.973 --> 02:15:49.508
MAKE AROUND AUTOMATION AND

02:15:49.574 --> 02:15:52.143
AROUND CARGO THROUGHPUT LIMITS.

02:15:52.210 --> 02:15:54.246
THAT IS WHY THIS BILL HAS MY

02:15:54.312 --> 02:15:56.414
SUPPORT TODAY, AND I WANT TO

02:15:56.481 --> 02:15:57.816
THANK ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES AND

02:15:57.883 --> 02:16:00.151
THE SENATOR FOR A ROBUST

02:16:00.218 --> 02:16:00.819
CONVERSATION. I THINK IT'S

02:16:00.886 --> 02:16:01.486
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT, AND I

02:16:01.553 --> 02:16:03.822
THINK IT'S GOING TO STICK WITH A

02:16:03.889 --> 02:16:05.457
LOT OF US FOR A LONG TIME. WITH

02:16:05.524 --> 02:16:06.958
THAT. MADAM SECRETARY, CAN WE

02:16:07.025 --> 02:16:08.326

02:16:08.393 --> 02:16:09.594

GET WITHIN. YOU GOT. YOU'RE DONE

WHENEVER YOU'RE READY, SENATOR.

02:17:30.141 --> 02:17:31.176
THANK YOU, CHAIR BRYANT, MEMBERS

02:17:31.242 --> 02:17:32.877

02:17:32.944 --> 02:17:35.413
YOU HEARING THIS BILL THIS THIS

02:17:35.480 --> 02:17:38.717
AFTERNOON. WE'LL TRY TO BE LESS

02:17:38.783 --> 02:17:41.553
TEDIOUS MAYBE THAN THE PRIOR

02:17:41.620 --> 02:17:43.221
BILL, I SAY WITH A SUBDUED

02:17:43.288 --> 02:17:47.926
VOICE. I'M HERE TO PRESENT SB

02:17:47.993 --> 02:17:50.462
279. THIS BILL WILL INCREASE

02:17:50.528 --> 02:17:51.896
FLEXIBILITY FOR FARMERS AND

02:17:51.963 --> 02:17:55.367
GROWERS TO COMPOST AGRICULTURAL

02:17:55.433 --> 02:17:57.836
WASTE AND INCREASE CAPACITY FOR

02:17:57.902 --> 02:18:01.740
COMMUNITY COMPOSTERS. THIS YEAR,

02:18:01.806 --> 02:18:04.843
A BAN ON OPEN BURNING OF

02:18:04.909 --> 02:18:07.012
AGRICULTURAL MATERIALS WENT INTO

02:18:07.078 --> 02:18:09.948
EFFECT, PLACING A SIGNIFICANT

02:18:10.015 --> 02:18:12.884
BURDEN ON FARMERS AND GROWERS ON

02:18:12.951 --> 02:18:15.053
HOW ARE THEY GOING TO MANAGE

02:18:15.120 --> 02:18:17.155
THEIR AGRICULTURAL WASTE. AND AS

02:18:17.222 --> 02:18:19.424
WE ALL KNOW, FARMERS ARE ALWAYS

02:18:19.491 --> 02:18:21.860
ON ON SORT OF THE EDGE. SO THEY

02:18:21.926 --> 02:18:23.261
NEED THEY NEED A LITTLE BIT OF

02:18:23.328 --> 02:18:27.165
BREAK HERE. COME COMPOUNDING

02:18:27.232 --> 02:18:29.701
THAT PROBLEM, CALIFORNIA DOESN'T

02:18:29.768 --> 02:18:31.970
CURRENTLY HAVE ENOUGH COMMERCIAL

02:18:32.037 --> 02:18:34.139
COMPOSTING FACILITIES TO MEET

02:18:34.205 --> 02:18:39.110
THE CURRENT WASTE DEMAND. SB 279

02:18:39.177 --> 02:18:41.680
ALLOWS FARMERS AND GROWERS TO

02:18:41.746 --> 02:18:43.415
COMPOST THEIR OWN WASTE FROM

02:18:43.481 --> 02:18:46.317
LARGE BIOMASS EVENTS AT MOST

02:18:46.384 --> 02:18:48.920
ONCE EVERY TEN YEARS IN A BIG

02:18:48.987 --> 02:18:51.056
EVENT LIKE REMOVAL OF A VINEYARD

02:18:51.122 --> 02:18:53.525
OR AN ORCHARD, AND TO ACCEPT

02:18:53.591 --> 02:18:55.760
OFFSITE AGRICULTURAL MATERIALS

02:18:55.827 --> 02:18:59.664
LIKE MANURE TO CATALYZE THE

02:18:59.731 --> 02:19:04.636
COMPOSTING PROCESS. SB 279 ALSO

02:19:04.703 --> 02:19:06.805
INCREASES CAPACITY FOR SMALL

02:19:06.871 --> 02:19:09.340
COMMUNITY COMPOSTERS BY ALLOWING

02:19:09.407 --> 02:19:12.277
THEM TO COMPOST UP TO 500YDÂ³ OF

02:19:12.343 --> 02:19:15.880
GREEN WASTE AND FOOD SCRAPS, AND

02:19:15.947 --> 02:19:19.417
SB 279 INCREASES THE AMOUNT A

02:19:19.484 --> 02:19:21.686
SMALL COMPOSTING OPERATION IS

02:19:21.753 --> 02:19:24.556
ALLOWED TO SELL OR GIVE AWAY TO

02:19:24.622 --> 02:19:28.526
UP TO 5000YDÂ³ ANNUALLY. THE BILL

02:19:28.593 --> 02:19:30.228
IS CO-SPONSORED BY THE

02:19:30.295 --> 02:19:32.764
CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE. THE

02:19:32.831 --> 02:19:35.667
WESTERN TREE NUT ASSOCIATION,

IS LOUIS BROWN OF THE WESTERN

COURTNEY BROWN OF CALIFORNIA

02:19:53.985 --> 02:19:55.487
ALLIANCE FOR COMMUNITY

02:19:55.553 --> 02:19:56.621
COMPOSTING. WITH THAT, I'LL TURN

02:19:56.688 --> 02:19:58.289
OVER TO THE WITNESSES, TO THE

02:19:58.356 --> 02:19:59.791
SUPPORTING WITNESSES, TWO

02:19:59.858 --> 02:20:00.825
MINUTES EACH. WHATEVER ORDER YOU

02:20:00.892 --> 02:20:02.360
WANT, MR. CHAIR, MEMBERS OF THE

02:20:02.427 --> 02:20:03.328
COMMITTEE, LOUIS BROWN, HERE

02:20:03.394 --> 02:20:05.663
TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE WESTERN

02:20:05.730 --> 02:20:06.297
TREE NUT ASSOCIATION, AMERICAN

02:20:06.364 --> 02:20:07.632
PISTACHIO GROWERS AND THE

02:20:07.699 --> 02:20:08.867
CALIFORNIA FRESH FRUIT

02:20:08.933 --> 02:20:09.768
ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THE

02:20:09.834 --> 02:20:12.804
BILL, BELIEVE ME, WE DON'T COME

02:20:12.871 --> 02:20:15.940
HERE SEEKING TO BE COMPOSTERS.

02:20:16.007 --> 02:20:19.244
OUR MEMBERS WANT TO BE FARMERS.

02:20:19.310 --> 02:20:20.578
UNFORTUNATELY, ANY NUMBER OF

02:20:20.645 --> 02:20:21.713
CIRCUMSTANCES THROUGHOUT THE

02:20:21.780 --> 02:20:23.515
STATE HAVE MADE THAT MORE

02:20:23.581 --> 02:20:24.949
DIFFICULT. FROM THE SUSTAINABLE

02:20:25.016 --> 02:20:27.152
GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ACT TO

02:20:27.218 --> 02:20:30.421
MARKETS TO INTERNATIONAL ISSUES,

02:20:30.488 --> 02:20:33.625
WE HAVE SEEN A DOWNTURN IN THE

02:20:33.691 --> 02:20:36.728
INDUSTRY. AND WITH THAT COMES

02:20:36.795 --> 02:20:39.097
ORCHARDS AND VINEYARDS THAT ARE

02:20:39.164 --> 02:20:41.266
IN NEED OF DOING SOMETHING WITH

02:20:41.332 --> 02:20:43.668
THAT WASTE. THERE HAS BEEN MONEY

02:20:43.735 --> 02:20:45.036
FOR THIS OVER THE LAST FEW

02:20:45.103 --> 02:20:46.671
YEARS. THERE WAS MONEY GIVEN TO

02:20:46.738 --> 02:20:48.640
THE SAN JOAQUIN AIR DISTRICT AND

02:20:48.706 --> 02:20:49.874
OTHERS TO DEAL WITH THE

02:20:49.941 --> 02:20:50.708
ALTERNATIVE TO AG BURN. THAT

02:20:50.775 --> 02:20:54.112
MONEY IS NOW GONE AND SO IT IS

02:20:54.179 --> 02:20:56.314
TOO EXPENSIVE FOR FARMERS JUST

02:20:56.381 --> 02:21:00.251
TO CHIP. AND FRANKLY, IF WE DO

02:21:00.318 --> 02:21:01.719
NOTHING WITH THAT WASTE, IT

02:21:01.786 --> 02:21:03.454
BECOMES A NUISANCE. IT HARBORS

02:21:03.521 --> 02:21:04.556
PESTS AND IT CREATES OTHER

02:21:04.622 --> 02:21:06.324
ISSUES IN THE VALLEY. SO THIS

02:21:06.391 --> 02:21:08.092
SEEMS TO BE A COMMON SENSE

02:21:08.159 --> 02:21:11.329
APPROACH. GIVE US OUR GROWERS,

02:21:11.396 --> 02:21:13.198
ONE ALTERNATIVE, THAT

02:21:13.264 --> 02:21:14.699
OPPORTUNITY ONCE EVERY TEN

02:21:14.766 --> 02:21:16.000
YEARS, WHEN YOU HAVE THAT

02:21:16.067 --> 02:21:17.702
ORCHARD REMOVAL OR THAT VINEYARD

02:21:17.769 --> 02:21:20.038
REMOVAL PROCESS TO DO SOMETHING

02:21:20.104 --> 02:21:21.506
WITH THAT WASTE THAT COULD

02:21:21.573 --> 02:21:24.042
POSSIBLY MAKE UP FOR THE LOSS OF

02:21:24.108 --> 02:21:27.645
THOSE CROPS AND IN THE INTERIM,

02:21:27.712 --> 02:21:29.013
ALLOW FOR THOSE GROWERS TO AT

02:21:29.080 --> 02:21:31.950
LEAST SURVIVE FOR THE NEXT

02:21:32.016 --> 02:21:33.351
OPPORTUNITY TO FIND A CROP THAT

02:21:33.418 --> 02:21:35.253
COULD TAKE THAT PLACE OF THAT

02:21:35.320 --> 02:21:37.088
PROPERTY. AND SO WITH THAT, WE

02:21:37.155 --> 02:21:38.857
ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND BE

02:21:38.923 --> 02:21:40.658
AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS YOU

02:21:40.725 --> 02:21:43.695
MIGHT HAVE. GOOD AFTERNOON,

02:21:43.761 --> 02:21:45.330
CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I AM COURTNEY

02:21:45.396 --> 02:21:47.165
BROWN WITH THE CALIFORNIA

02:21:47.232 --> 02:21:48.500
ALLIANCE FOR COMMUNITY

02:21:48.566 --> 02:21:52.203
COMPOSTING FROM 2021 TO 2025,

02:21:52.270 --> 02:21:54.272
OUR ORGANIZATION LAUNCHED AND

02:21:54.339 --> 02:21:57.475
EXPANDED 175 COMPOST HUBS IN THE

02:21:57.542 --> 02:21:58.910
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE

02:21:58.977 --> 02:22:01.913
RECOVERED OVER 6200 TONS OF FOOD

02:22:01.980 --> 02:22:03.615
AND GREEN MATERIAL THAT IS NOT

02:22:03.681 --> 02:22:05.516
BEING CURRENTLY DIVERTED BY CITY

02:22:05.583 --> 02:22:07.919
SPONSORED PROGRAMS. THESE HUBS

02:22:07.986 --> 02:22:10.488
CREATED 42 FULL TIME EQUIVALENT

02:22:10.555 --> 02:22:11.823
JOBS, AND THEY PRODUCE HIGH

02:22:11.890 --> 02:22:14.192
QUALITY COMPOST THAT'S USED TO

02:22:14.259 --> 02:22:17.362
IMPROVE LOCAL SOIL AND GROW FOOD

02:22:17.428 --> 02:22:18.496
FOR DISADVANTAGED AND LOW INCOME

02:22:18.563 --> 02:22:22.467
COMMUNITIES. SB 279 SUPPORTS

02:22:22.533 --> 02:22:23.968
LOCAL INVESTMENTS IN THIS TYPE

02:22:24.035 --> 02:22:26.337
OF WORK, AND IT'S PROVEN TO BE

02:22:26.404 --> 02:22:27.672
EFFECTIVE AT BOTH URBAN AND

02:22:27.739 --> 02:22:30.742
RURAL COMMUNITIES. RIGHT NOW,

02:22:30.808 --> 02:22:31.609
CALIFORNIA IS SENDING A

02:22:31.676 --> 02:22:33.478
SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF ORGANIC

02:22:33.544 --> 02:22:35.346
WASTE PRODUCED ANNUALLY TO

02:22:35.413 --> 02:22:36.681
LANDFILLS PRECISELY BECAUSE

02:22:36.748 --> 02:22:39.183
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH CAPACITY, AND

02:22:39.250 --> 02:22:41.019
BECAUSE MANY EXISTING FACILITIES

02:22:41.085 --> 02:22:42.887
ARE TOO FAR AWAY FROM THEIR

02:22:42.954 --> 02:22:44.622
SOURCES FOR COMPOSTING TO BE A

02:22:44.689 --> 02:22:47.158
COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTION. SO SOME

02:22:47.225 --> 02:22:50.194
OPPONENTS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT SB

02:22:50.261 --> 02:22:52.230
279 WOULD ALLOW UNREGULATED FOOD

02:22:52.297 --> 02:22:54.766
WASTE COMPOSTING OPERATIONS. AND

02:22:54.832 --> 02:22:57.936
THIS IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE. UNDER

02:22:58.002 --> 02:23:00.271
EXISTING REGULATIONS, COMPOSTING

02:23:00.338 --> 02:23:03.007
SITES WITH LESS THAN 100YDÂ³ ARE

02:23:03.074 --> 02:23:05.276
ALREADY ALLOWED TO ACCEPT FOOD

02:23:05.343 --> 02:23:07.779
WASTE, AND THESE ACTIVITIES ARE

02:23:07.845 --> 02:23:10.381
EXPLICITLY EXEMPT FROM OUR

02:23:10.448 --> 02:23:11.716
PERMITTING. PRECISELY BECAUSE

02:23:11.783 --> 02:23:13.751
THEY'RE SMALL SITES, THEY'RE LOW

02:23:13.818 --> 02:23:16.020
RISK, THEY'RE LOW NUISANCE, AND

02:23:16.087 --> 02:23:17.855
WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED ON OUR OWN

02:23:17.922 --> 02:23:19.257
ACCORD THEIR EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT

02:23:19.324 --> 02:23:22.961
OF OUR OWN OPERATIONS. WITH SB

02:23:23.027 --> 02:23:24.295
279, BOTH STATE AND LOCAL

02:23:24.362 --> 02:23:25.563
AGENCIES ARE GOING TO RETAIN

02:23:25.630 --> 02:23:27.031
THEIR AUTHORITY TO INSPECT AND

02:23:27.098 --> 02:23:28.733
VERIFY THAT THESE COMPOSTING

02:23:28.800 --> 02:23:30.635
SITES ARE MEETING THE REGULATORY

02:23:30.702 --> 02:23:31.536
REQUIREMENTS, AND THEY CAN DO

02:23:31.602 --> 02:23:34.038
THAT AT ANY TIME, INCREASING THE

02:23:34.105 --> 02:23:36.174
VOLUME THRESHOLD JUST BY A

02:23:36.240 --> 02:23:38.009
LITTLE AMOUNT FOR COMMUNITY

02:23:38.076 --> 02:23:39.744
COMPOSTERS DOESN'T UNDERMINE THE

02:23:39.811 --> 02:23:40.745
INVESTMENTS THAT LARGE

02:23:40.812 --> 02:23:42.246
COMMERCIAL COMPOSTING FACILITIES

02:23:42.313 --> 02:23:45.116
HAVE ALREADY MADE. IN FACT, IT

02:23:45.183 --> 02:23:46.417
COMPLEMENTS IT BECAUSE WE FILL

02:23:46.484 --> 02:23:48.286
IN CRITICAL GAPS IN CAPACITY

02:23:48.353 --> 02:23:49.487
THAT COMMERCIAL SITES ARE NOT

02:23:49.554 --> 02:23:51.389
MEETING RIGHT NOW. ACCORDING TO

02:23:51.456 --> 02:23:53.825
CAL RECYCLE, WE NEED 50 TO 100

02:23:53.891 --> 02:23:55.727
NEW FACILITIES THAT CAN PROCESS

02:23:55.793 --> 02:23:57.895
OVER 50 TONS PER DAY IN ORDER TO

02:23:57.962 --> 02:24:00.331
MEET OUR SB 1383 DIVERSION

02:24:00.398 --> 02:24:01.699
TARGETS, AND WE'RE FAR FROM

02:24:01.766 --> 02:24:03.301
ACHIEVING THAT GOAL. SO NOW IS

02:24:03.368 --> 02:24:05.403
NOT THE TIME FOR PROTECTIONISM

02:24:05.470 --> 02:24:07.905
OVER A LIMITED COMPOST SUPPLY,

02:24:07.972 --> 02:24:10.341
SB 279 EXPANDS THE TOTAL AMOUNT

02:24:10.408 --> 02:24:11.943
OF COMPOST THAT CAN BE PRODUCED

02:24:12.010 --> 02:24:14.345
AND USED FOR AGRICULTURAL AND

02:24:14.412 --> 02:24:15.413
ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS BY

02:24:15.480 --> 02:24:16.781
CREATING MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO

02:24:16.848 --> 02:24:18.783
MAKE HEALTHY SOIL AND REDUCING

02:24:18.850 --> 02:24:21.019
THE ORGANICS THAT WE SEND TO

02:24:21.085 --> 02:24:23.021
LANDFILL. SO THE BOTTOM LINE, WE

02:24:23.087 --> 02:24:24.789
NEED MORE COMPOSTING. IN

02:24:24.856 --> 02:24:26.791
CALIFORNIA, THAT MEANS EXPANDING

02:24:26.858 --> 02:24:28.726
CAPACITY, DIVERSIFYING THE

02:24:28.793 --> 02:24:30.395
OPTIONS THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

02:24:30.461 --> 02:24:32.630
CAN CHOOSE, AND MAKING ROOM FOR

02:24:32.697 --> 02:24:34.499
SUSTAINABLE FOOD SOLUTIONS AT

02:24:34.565 --> 02:24:36.300
ALL SCALES. SO FOR THESE

02:24:36.367 --> 02:24:38.736
REASONS, I RESPECTFULLY URGE

02:24:38.803 --> 02:24:42.073

FAVOR OF COMPOSTING, BUT MAYBE

02:27:30.074 --> 02:27:31.909
NOT IN FAVOR OF DEREGULATING IT.

JURISDICTIONS ACROSS THE STATE.

02:27:44.622 --> 02:27:46.591
FEW PEOPLE HAVE SPENT MORE TIME

02:27:46.657 --> 02:27:48.426
ADVOCATING FOR THE EXPANSION OF

02:27:48.492 --> 02:27:49.994

02:27:50.061 --> 02:27:51.662
REGULATIONS OVER THE LAST 23

02:27:51.729 --> 02:27:53.431
YEARS THAN I HAVE BOTH HERE IN

02:27:53.497 --> 02:27:56.300
CALIFORNIA AND THE US. ACROSS

02:27:56.367 --> 02:27:58.369
THE US IS IN MY WORK WITH US

02:27:58.436 --> 02:27:59.737
COMPOSTING COUNCIL, BUT IN A

02:27:59.804 --> 02:28:01.505
VERY AWKWARD POSITION OF HAVING

02:28:01.572 --> 02:28:02.974
TO OPPOSE THE BILL, AS THE

02:28:03.040 --> 02:28:04.642
SPONSOR HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO

02:28:04.709 --> 02:28:05.610
ADDRESS OUR KEY CONCERNS WITH

02:28:05.676 --> 02:28:07.845
IT. WHILE WE APPRECIATE SOME OF

02:28:07.912 --> 02:28:09.680
THE AMENDMENTS, THEY WERE NOT

02:28:09.747 --> 02:28:11.415
ADEQUATE TO ADDRESSING OUR TWO

02:28:11.482 --> 02:28:13.317
REMAINING KEY ISSUES. WE

02:28:13.384 --> 02:28:14.418
DESPERATELY NEED TO EXPAND

02:28:14.485 --> 02:28:16.187
COMPOSTING CAPACITY ACROSS THE

02:28:16.254 --> 02:28:18.256
STATE TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF

02:28:18.322 --> 02:28:19.657
SB 1383. THIS IS NOT A

02:28:19.724 --> 02:28:21.525
REASONABLE WAY TO GO ABOUT IT.

02:28:21.592 --> 02:28:22.660
THE BILL STILL DOES TWO KEY

02:28:22.727 --> 02:28:24.629
THINGS WE FIND PROBLEMATIC.

02:28:24.695 --> 02:28:26.564
FIRST, IT PROVIDES AN EXEMPTION

02:28:26.631 --> 02:28:27.698
FOR AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS FOR

02:28:27.765 --> 02:28:29.700
A LARGE BIOMASS EVENT, AS WAS

02:28:29.767 --> 02:28:31.602
DESCRIBED GENERALLY WOULD BE AN

02:28:31.669 --> 02:28:34.171
ORCHARD OR VINEYARD REMOVAL. BUT

02:28:34.238 --> 02:28:35.640
ALLOWING THOSE EVENTS TO DEFINE

02:28:35.706 --> 02:28:38.476
AN ABILITY TO BECOME A

02:28:38.542 --> 02:28:39.877
DEREGULATED COMMERCIAL

02:28:39.944 --> 02:28:41.646
COMPOSTING OPERATION IS

02:28:41.712 --> 02:28:42.413
SIGNIFICANT TO MANY OF MY

02:28:42.480 --> 02:28:43.981

02:28:44.048 --> 02:28:45.283

PROTECTION MEASURES ACROSS

02:28:47.918 --> 02:28:49.687
CALIFORNIA. I'LL DESCRIBE THIS

02:28:49.754 --> 02:28:51.322
PERMITTING INEQUITY AS FOLLOWS.

02:28:51.389 --> 02:28:52.590
ACROSS THE STATE, DOZENS OF

02:28:52.657 --> 02:28:53.891
FACILITY OPERATORS AND

02:28:53.958 --> 02:28:55.626
RATEPAYERS WHO USE THEIR

02:28:55.693 --> 02:28:57.194

02:28:57.261 --> 02:28:58.829
INVESTMENTS INTO REGULATORY

02:28:58.896 --> 02:29:01.365
COMPLIANCE AND MITIGATION

02:29:01.432 --> 02:29:03.200
MEASURES. SO IN YOLO COUNTY,

02:29:03.267 --> 02:29:05.403
NORTHERN COMPOSTING HAS SPENT

02:29:05.469 --> 02:29:07.004
$70 MILLION TO BUILD A FACILITY

02:29:07.071 --> 02:29:08.706

02:29:13.411 --> 02:29:15.546

02:29:15.613 --> 02:29:17.381
$30 MILLION TO OPEN A NEW

02:29:17.448 --> 02:29:19.083

02:29:19.150 --> 02:29:20.885
AFTER THAT IS GOING TO BE

02:29:20.951 --> 02:29:22.386
COUNTING ON THOSE AGRICULTURAL

02:29:22.453 --> 02:29:23.954
MARKETS AND PROBABLY ARE GOING

02:29:24.021 --> 02:29:26.257
TO HAVE SOME PROBLEMS WITH

02:29:26.324 --> 02:29:27.792
COMPETITORS WHO MAY OR MAY NOT

02:29:27.858 --> 02:29:29.460
BE REGULATED TO THE SAME EXTENT

02:29:29.527 --> 02:29:31.595
THEY ARE IN MERCED COUNTY. A NEW

02:29:31.662 --> 02:29:33.864
PERMIT WAS ISSUED ON JULY 2ND

02:29:33.931 --> 02:29:36.133
FOR A FACILITY TO OPEN THERE IN

02:29:36.200 --> 02:29:38.302
TULARE COUNTY. CEQA PROCESS IS

02:29:38.369 --> 02:29:40.371
COMPLETE, PERMITTING UNDERWAY.

02:29:40.438 --> 02:29:42.940
THIS IS JUST TO NAME A FEW.

02:29:43.007 --> 02:29:43.941
WELL, IT'S CERTAIN HOW MANY

02:29:44.008 --> 02:29:44.875
FARMERS WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE.

02:29:44.942 --> 02:29:45.810
WELL, IT'S NOT CERTAIN HOW MANY

02:29:45.876 --> 02:29:47.578
FARMERS WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

02:29:47.645 --> 02:29:49.280
THIS, CARVE OUT THIS.

02:29:49.347 --> 02:29:51.082
DEREGULATION MAY STRAND HISTORIC

02:29:51.148 --> 02:29:52.249

02:29:59.390 --> 02:30:01.158
COMPOST WE'RE SELLING IN

02:30:01.225 --> 02:30:01.692
CALIFORNIA FROM COMMERCIAL

WHAT IS ALLOWED UNDER CURRENT

02:30:14.205 --> 02:30:16.040

BE VIABLE GIVEN THEIR RELIANCE

02:30:20.144 --> 02:30:22.413
ON THOSE MARKETS. WHAT WE HAVE

02:30:22.480 --> 02:30:25.583
ASKED THE SPONSORS TO DO IS

02:30:25.649 --> 02:30:27.952
LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF MATERIALS

02:30:28.018 --> 02:30:30.588
SOLD FROM THE 5000YDÂ³ ANNUALLY,

02:30:30.654 --> 02:30:32.590
WHICH IS FIVE TIMES THE CURRENT

02:30:32.656 --> 02:30:34.658
LIMIT TO A MORE REASONABLE

02:30:34.725 --> 02:30:37.661
APPROACH ON BALANCE OF LIMITING

02:30:37.728 --> 02:30:40.097
IT TO 2000YDÂ³, DOUBLE WHAT'S

02:30:40.164 --> 02:30:42.266
CURRENTLY ALLOWED. THIS BILL

02:30:42.333 --> 02:30:43.701
ALSO ALLOWS SIGNIFICANT VOLUMES

02:30:43.768 --> 02:30:45.736
OF FOOD WASTE AND UNREGULATED

02:30:45.803 --> 02:30:48.406
SMALL SITES. ALSO A FIVE FOLD

02:30:48.472 --> 02:30:49.740
INCREASE IN THE ALLOWED

02:30:49.807 --> 02:30:51.909
EXEMPTION FROM ANY REGULATION

02:30:51.976 --> 02:30:53.477
CREATING POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL

02:30:53.544 --> 02:30:54.979
IMPACTS THAT ARE BAD FOR THE

02:30:55.045 --> 02:30:57.681
INDUSTRY. WE'RE AT A SOLID 330,

02:30:57.748 --> 02:30:59.550
WHICH IS GENEROUS. BE REALLY

02:30:59.617 --> 02:31:00.951
QUICK. FOOD MATERIALS REPRESENT

02:31:01.018 --> 02:31:02.787
A SIGNIFICANT RISK TO THE

02:31:02.853 --> 02:31:04.054
ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH,

02:31:04.121 --> 02:31:05.656
AND THE PRIMARY REASON WE

02:31:05.723 --> 02:31:07.391
COLLECT SOLID WASTE TO MINIMIZE

02:31:07.458 --> 02:31:09.193
VECTORS WHICH CARRY DISEASE.

02:31:09.260 --> 02:31:10.895
WE'RE ASKING FOR A LIMIT ON THE

02:31:10.961 --> 02:31:12.797
AMOUNT OF FOOD WASTE. THE

02:31:12.863 --> 02:31:15.299
SPONSORS HAVE SAID WE DON'T WANT

02:31:15.366 --> 02:31:17.501
500YDÂ³, WHICH WEIGHS ABOUT 200

02:31:17.568 --> 02:31:19.670
TONS OF FOOD WASTE. THAT'S NOT

02:31:19.737 --> 02:31:21.038
WHAT WE WANT AT THESE SITES. WE

02:31:21.105 --> 02:31:23.274
JUST WANT TO HAVE 500YDÂ³ OF

02:31:23.340 --> 02:31:24.041
TOTAL MATERIAL. SO WE'RE ASKING

02:31:24.108 --> 02:31:27.278
FOR A LIMIT ON 20% OF THAT

02:31:27.344 --> 02:31:30.848
TOTAL, BE FOOD WASTE ONLY HAVE

02:31:30.915 --> 02:31:31.882
TO STOP YOU RIGHT THERE. THANK

02:31:31.949 --> 02:31:34.518
YOU. ANY PERSONS IN THE HEARING

02:31:34.585 --> 02:31:37.488
ROOM IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE.

02:31:37.555 --> 02:31:40.057
WE'LL NOW TURN IT TO COMMITTEE

02:31:40.124 --> 02:31:41.292
MEMBERS. QUESTIONS? COMMENTS?

02:31:41.358 --> 02:31:43.627
CONCERNS. IS THAT A QUESTION,

02:31:43.694 --> 02:31:45.729
MR. ELLIS? COMMENT. CONCERN.

02:31:45.796 --> 02:31:48.732
COMMENT. I HAVE A FARM AND IT'S

02:31:48.799 --> 02:31:52.436
REALLY TOUGH. YOU KNOW YOU YOU

02:31:52.503 --> 02:31:54.605
YOU PRUNE. THERE ARE CERTAIN

02:31:54.672 --> 02:31:58.209
TIMES OF THE YEAR, YOU KNOW, YOU

02:31:58.275 --> 02:32:01.111
HAVE PILES OF GREEN WASTE AND

02:32:01.178 --> 02:32:02.580
IT'S TOUGH TO GET AROUND. YOU

02:32:02.646 --> 02:32:05.216
HAVE TO GO GET AN AIR PERMIT IF

02:32:05.282 --> 02:32:06.817
YOU CAN GET ONE. I BUNCHED UP

02:32:06.884 --> 02:32:10.454
TUMBLEWEEDS ONE YEAR AND I

02:32:10.521 --> 02:32:13.724
COULDN'T GET A BURN PERMIT. SO I

02:32:13.791 --> 02:32:15.526
DID SOMETHING REALLY

02:32:15.593 --> 02:32:17.061
UNECONOMICAL. I BOUGHT A BALER

02:32:17.127 --> 02:32:18.796
AND A GRINDER AND A REACTOR, AND

02:32:18.863 --> 02:32:21.499
I MADE ORGANIC ACIDS AND ORGANIC

02:32:21.565 --> 02:32:23.801
PESTICIDE OUT OF TUMBLEWEEDS,

02:32:23.868 --> 02:32:25.503
BUT IT WAS COST PROHIBITIVE. SO

02:32:25.569 --> 02:32:26.971
THERE ARE USES FOR THIS

02:32:27.037 --> 02:32:28.472
MATERIAL, AND I ENCOURAGE,

02:32:28.539 --> 02:32:29.673
RECYCLE AND REUSE FOR GRAPE

02:32:29.740 --> 02:32:31.408
PUMICE, FOR EXAMPLE. THE GRAPE

02:32:31.475 --> 02:32:32.943
INDUSTRY HAS A HUGE PROBLEM WITH

02:32:33.010 --> 02:32:35.980
WITH PUMICE. I'M INVOLVED WITH

02:32:36.046 --> 02:32:38.516
THE ACTUALLY MAKING SOME

02:32:38.582 --> 02:32:40.784
PRODUCTS FROM PUMICE. BUT BUT

02:32:40.851 --> 02:32:43.254
BUT THE USABLE PORTION OF A LOT

02:32:43.320 --> 02:32:45.022
OF THOSE PRODUCTS IS NOT

02:32:45.089 --> 02:32:47.491
MARKETABLE YET, SO I ENCOURAGE.

02:32:47.558 --> 02:32:49.260
THANK YOU SENATOR I I'M I'M IN

02:32:49.326 --> 02:32:50.694
SUPPORT OF THIS BECAUSE WE DO

02:32:50.761 --> 02:32:54.098
NEED WE DO NEED MORE COMPOSTING

02:32:54.164 --> 02:32:54.798
ABILITY AND IT'S NOTHING BUT

02:32:54.865 --> 02:32:57.001
GOOD FOR THE SOIL. SO I, I

02:32:57.067 --> 02:32:57.768
APPRECIATE EVERYBODY'S COMMENTS.

02:32:57.835 --> 02:32:59.537
THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, MR. ELLIS,

02:32:59.603 --> 02:33:01.205
I LEARNED SOMETHING NEW ABOUT

02:33:01.272 --> 02:33:01.972
YOU. EVERY EVERY COMMITTEE

02:33:02.039 --> 02:33:04.608
HEARING. I'M WAITING FOR YOU TO

02:33:04.675 --> 02:33:06.143
TELL EVERYBODY ABOUT THE BAND,

02:33:06.210 --> 02:33:09.213
BUT WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT LATER.

02:33:09.280 --> 02:33:10.781
MR. MCNERNEY, WOULD YOU LIKE TO

02:33:10.848 --> 02:33:13.984

02:33:14.051 --> 02:33:16.787
IS REALLY, AS MR. BROWN

02:33:16.854 --> 02:33:18.889
MENTIONED, THIS IS COMMON SENSE.

02:33:18.956 --> 02:33:21.859
SMALL AGRICULTURAL AND

02:33:21.926 --> 02:33:25.029
COMPOSTING OPERATIONS ALLOW AG

02:33:25.095 --> 02:33:27.932
FOLKS TO USE THAT RESOURCE TO

02:33:27.998 --> 02:33:31.101
ENRICH THEIR SOILS AND SPARE THE

02:33:31.168 --> 02:33:33.237
ADDITIONAL COST OF SHIPPING IT

02:33:33.304 --> 02:33:36.106
OR HANDLING IT IN OTHER WAYS. SO

02:33:36.173 --> 02:33:38.042
I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S COMMON

02:33:38.108 --> 02:33:39.677
SENSE. AND I ASK FOR AN AYE

02:33:39.743 --> 02:33:40.611

OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. WE'RE

02:34:41.405 --> 02:34:43.173
LOOKING AT UPSTREAM METHANE

02:34:43.240 --> 02:34:44.475
EMISSIONS AND TRYING TO MAKE

02:34:44.541 --> 02:34:46.310
SURE THAT BOTH THE GAS AND THE

02:34:46.377 --> 02:34:48.946

02:34:49.013 --> 02:34:50.214
ASSEMBLY MEMBER, ABOUT ALL THE

02:34:50.280 --> 02:34:51.815
OIL AND GAS IMPORTS WE MAKE TO

02:34:51.882 --> 02:34:53.617
THE STATE AND THE LACK OF

02:34:53.684 --> 02:34:55.152
KNOWLEDGE WE HAVE ABOUT UPSTREAM

02:34:55.219 --> 02:34:56.020
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, WE

02:34:56.086 --> 02:34:58.489
IMPORT ABOUT 90% OF OUR GAS AND

02:34:58.555 --> 02:35:00.824
ABOUT 50% OF OUR OIL COMES FROM

02:35:00.891 --> 02:35:02.593
IRAQ, SAUDI ARABIA, ECUADOR,

02:35:02.660 --> 02:35:04.128
PLACES LIKE THAT. SO THIS BILL

02:35:04.194 --> 02:35:05.796
IS REALLY AN ATTEMPT TO GET

02:35:05.863 --> 02:35:07.698

SHORT TERM, SHORT TERM CLIMATE

02:35:19.410 --> 02:35:19.977

02:36:03.454 --> 02:36:05.622

THEIR OPPOSITION ACTUALLY, AND

02:36:12.529 --> 02:36:16.266
THEY COULD HAVE. IT'S OKAY. THEY

02:36:16.333 --> 02:36:16.900
DID. OKAY. SORRY. I DIDN'T WANT

02:36:16.967 --> 02:36:18.569
TO MISTAKE NOT CALLING HIS

02:36:18.635 --> 02:36:19.970
BLUFF. NO, I MEAN, THEY

02:36:20.037 --> 02:36:21.672
CERTAINLY DIDN'T SHOW UP, SO.

02:36:21.739 --> 02:36:32.182

02:36:32.249 --> 02:36:32.950
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS? COMMENTS,

02:36:33.016 --> 02:36:35.385
CONCERNS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

02:36:35.452 --> 02:36:37.354
MR. ELLIS, I WAS WAITING FOR IT.

02:36:37.421 --> 02:36:40.891
I JUST HAVE A QUICK QUESTION.

02:36:40.958 --> 02:36:42.426
THE WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:36:42.493 --> 02:36:43.694
METHANE EMISSIONS AND YOU'RE

02:36:43.761 --> 02:36:45.229
TALKING ABOUT NATURAL GAS

02:36:45.295 --> 02:36:51.668
IMPORTS. NATURAL GAS IS LIKE 90%

02:36:51.735 --> 02:36:53.604
METHANE AND 2% METHANE AND A

02:36:53.670 --> 02:36:56.673
COUPLE PERCENT BUTANE. HOW HOW

02:36:56.740 --> 02:36:59.510
WOULD YOU PROPOSE, I GUESS,

02:36:59.576 --> 02:37:02.112
WHAT'S THE MECHANISM FOR

02:37:02.179 --> 02:37:03.614
REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF METHANE

02:37:03.680 --> 02:37:06.016
IN NATURAL GAS WHEN IT'S MOSTLY

02:37:06.083 --> 02:37:08.152
METHANE? SO WHEN YOU'RE

02:37:08.218 --> 02:37:10.053
PRODUCING THE GAS DRILLING FOR

02:37:10.120 --> 02:37:11.421
IT, FRACKING FOR WHATEVER THEY

02:37:11.488 --> 02:37:12.823
DO IN PERMIAN BASIN AND ALL

02:37:12.890 --> 02:37:14.324
THROUGH THE MARCELLUS SHALE,

02:37:14.391 --> 02:37:16.093
THEY THERE'S ALL DIFFERENT

02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:17.694
METHODS THEY USE TO PRODUCE THAT

02:37:17.761 --> 02:37:19.129
GAS AND ALSO TRANSPORT THAT GAS.

02:37:19.196 --> 02:37:20.664
SO WHETHER IT'S LEAKS IN

02:37:20.731 --> 02:37:21.899
PIPELINES THAT WE'RE WORRIED

02:37:21.965 --> 02:37:23.734
ABOUT FOR, YOU KNOW, SHODDY

02:37:23.801 --> 02:37:25.102
EQUIPMENT OR ACTUALLY ON SITE,

02:37:25.169 --> 02:37:26.236
THERE'S SOME PRACTICES CALLED

02:37:26.303 --> 02:37:27.805
FLARING. SO IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE

02:37:27.871 --> 02:37:29.106
ACTUALLY GETTING TOO MUCH GAS

02:37:29.173 --> 02:37:30.507
OUT OF A PETROLEUM FIELD, YOU

02:37:30.574 --> 02:37:32.609
END UP FLARING SOME OF IT OFF

02:37:32.676 --> 02:37:34.812
THAT YOU DON'T NEED. THOSE ARE

02:37:34.878 --> 02:37:35.913
HARMFUL. AND WE THINK THE BEST

02:37:35.979 --> 02:37:36.513
PRODUCERS OUT THERE ARE DOING

02:37:36.580 --> 02:37:38.048
THIS THE RIGHT WAY WITHOUT

02:37:38.115 --> 02:37:39.550
FLARING AND WITH REALLY TIGHT

02:37:39.616 --> 02:37:40.484
MONITORING PROTOCOLS. THEY USE

02:37:40.551 --> 02:37:43.053
SATELLITE TECHNOLOGY TO KEEP AN

02:37:43.120 --> 02:37:43.554
EYE ON THEIR PRODUCTION

02:37:43.620 --> 02:37:45.289
OPERATIONS. SO IT'S NOT SO MUCH

02:37:45.355 --> 02:37:47.925
THE ENDING, THE IMPORT ITSELF.

02:37:47.991 --> 02:37:49.593
IT'S MAKING SURE THAT THE PLACES

02:37:49.660 --> 02:37:50.627
THAT WE'RE BRINGING IT IN FROM

02:37:50.694 --> 02:37:52.596
ARE ADOPTING THE BEST PRACTICES

02:37:52.663 --> 02:37:53.931
POSSIBLE. SO THERE'S A GLOBAL

02:37:53.997 --> 02:37:55.399
METHANE PARTNERSHIP WHERE OIL

02:37:55.465 --> 02:37:57.534
AND GAS COMPANIES ALL OVER THE

02:37:57.601 --> 02:37:59.269
WORLD ARE SORT OF COMMITTING TO

02:37:59.336 --> 02:38:00.037
SOME OF THESE BEST PRACTICES. SO

02:38:00.103 --> 02:38:01.738
WE JUST WANT TO SEE THAT

02:38:01.805 --> 02:38:04.007
REFLECTED IN THE GAS WE BRING IN

02:38:04.074 --> 02:38:05.509
HERE. OKAY. I'VE BEEN IN THE OIL

02:38:05.576 --> 02:38:06.944
AND GAS SECTOR FOR 40 YEARS, SO

02:38:07.010 --> 02:38:08.579
I UNDERSTAND IT REALLY WELL. I

02:38:08.645 --> 02:38:10.547
WAS JUST CURIOUS AS TO HOW YOU

02:38:10.614 --> 02:38:11.915
MIGHT REDUCE THAT METHANE. THANK

02:38:11.982 --> 02:38:15.752
YOU. YEAH. SEEING NO OTHER

02:38:15.819 --> 02:38:17.487
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. DO WE

02:38:17.554 --> 02:38:21.158

SENATE PRO TEM ELECT. LIMÃN, IF

02:39:06.637 --> 02:39:09.873
YOU CAN HEAR ME, WE ARE WAITING

02:39:09.940 --> 02:39:13.277
FOR YOU. YES, I'M HAPPY TO

02:39:13.343 --> 02:39:15.112
PRESENT THEIR BILLS. OKAY.

02:39:15.178 --> 02:39:18.782
GOTCHA. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING

02:39:18.849 --> 02:39:21.385
ABOUT. SENATOR. IT'S GOOD TO SEE

02:39:21.451 --> 02:39:24.988
YOU. SB 674, WHENEVER YOU'RE

02:39:25.055 --> 02:39:26.356
READY. YOU EVER SEEN ME? IT'S

02:39:26.423 --> 02:39:27.691
STARTING IN THE SAME PLACE AT

02:39:27.758 --> 02:39:29.626
THE SAME TIME. THANK YOU, MR.

02:39:29.693 --> 02:39:33.597
CHAIR. I AM HERE TO PRESENT SB

02:39:33.664 --> 02:39:37.634
674. WHY THANK YOU. SB 674 IS A

02:39:37.701 --> 02:39:40.871
BILL TO PROMOTE RECYCLING OF

02:39:40.938 --> 02:39:43.040
TETRAPAKS. IF I COULD HAVE A

02:39:43.106 --> 02:39:44.541
PROP, IT'S ALREADY HERE IN FRONT

02:39:44.608 --> 02:39:46.677
OF ME. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF

02:39:46.743 --> 02:39:48.345
WHAT THOSE LOOK LIKE. IF YOU

02:39:48.412 --> 02:39:49.079
EVEN HAD FINE CALIFORNIA WINES

02:39:49.146 --> 02:39:51.281
FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY LATELY,

02:39:51.348 --> 02:39:52.616
THEY'RE ONE EXAMPLE OF THE KINDS

02:39:52.683 --> 02:39:54.418
OF BEVERAGES THAT ARE CONTAINED

02:39:54.484 --> 02:39:59.423
IN THIS PACKAGING. AND SB 674

02:39:59.489 --> 02:40:02.426
MERELY REVISES THE CRV ON

02:40:02.492 --> 02:40:03.560
CONTAINERS LIKE THIS SO THAT

02:40:03.627 --> 02:40:05.095
THEY'RE MORE COMPETITIVE WITH

02:40:05.162 --> 02:40:06.363
OTHER SIMILARLY SITUATED

02:40:06.430 --> 02:40:07.831
CONTAINERS IN THE MARKET. THERE

02:40:07.898 --> 02:40:08.966
WERE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS FROM

02:40:09.032 --> 02:40:10.667
THE GOVERNOR BEFORE ABOUT THE

02:40:10.734 --> 02:40:12.536
RECYCLING STREAM. I'M PLEASED TO

02:40:12.602 --> 02:40:14.037
NOTE THAT THERE IS PRESENTLY

02:40:14.104 --> 02:40:17.507
UNDER CONSTRUCTION A RECYCLING

02:40:17.574 --> 02:40:19.276
FACILITY IN LODI. IN ORDER TO

02:40:19.343 --> 02:40:22.145
CONVERT THESE USE THESE THESE

02:40:22.212 --> 02:40:23.947
PRODUCTS LATER IN THE WASTE

02:40:24.014 --> 02:40:25.415
STREAM INTO BUILDING MATERIALS

02:40:25.482 --> 02:40:26.850
WITHOUT THE USE OF ANY WATER OR

02:40:26.917 --> 02:40:29.686
OTHER OR OTHER PRODUCTS. IT'S AN

02:40:29.753 --> 02:40:31.154
ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE

02:40:31.221 --> 02:40:32.689
TECHNOLOGY, AND THE BILL SIMPLY

02:40:32.756 --> 02:40:34.424
PROVIDES FOR EQUITY IN THE

02:40:34.491 --> 02:40:35.759
MARKET. WITH RESPECT TO THE CRV.

02:40:35.826 --> 02:40:38.228
AND I WOULD ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

02:40:38.295 --> 02:40:40.731
AND WITH ME IS KIRK KIMBLE.

02:40:40.797 --> 02:40:41.932
THANK YOU, SENATOR. THANK YOU,

02:40:41.999 --> 02:40:44.101
MR. CHAIR, AND MEMBERS OF THE

02:40:44.167 --> 02:40:44.768
COMMITTEE HERE TODAY ON BEHALF

02:40:44.835 --> 02:40:47.070
OF BEATBOX BEVERAGES IN SUPPORT

02:40:47.137 --> 02:40:49.139
OF THE BILL. AS THE SENATOR

02:40:49.206 --> 02:40:50.540
MENTIONED, WE MANUFACTURE A

02:40:50.607 --> 02:40:53.076
PRODUCT IN A SIMILARLY SITUATED

02:40:53.143 --> 02:40:54.678
CONTAINER UNDER 24OZ. AND SO

02:40:54.745 --> 02:40:56.747
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE BILL

02:40:56.813 --> 02:40:58.615
SEEKS TO DO, IS REALLY PROVIDE

02:40:58.682 --> 02:41:00.117
PARITY FOR THESE PRODUCTS,

02:41:00.183 --> 02:41:01.485
SIMILAR TO ALL THE PRODUCTS THAT

02:41:01.551 --> 02:41:03.286
ARE ALREADY IN THE CRV WHERE WE

02:41:03.353 --> 02:41:04.621
ALREADY HAVE, UNDER EXISTING

02:41:04.688 --> 02:41:07.157
LAW, KIND OF A THRESHOLD, IF YOU

02:41:07.224 --> 02:41:08.925
WILL, AT 24OZ AND UNDER A SINGLE

02:41:08.992 --> 02:41:11.828
PRODUCT AT A LESSER CRV ABOVE

02:41:11.895 --> 02:41:14.731
24OZ, A HIGHER CRV, THE BILL

02:41:14.798 --> 02:41:18.135
SEEKS TO TAKE THAT NUMBER FROM

02:41:18.201 --> 02:41:19.703
$0.25 TO $0.10. WHEN WE PASSED

02:41:19.770 --> 02:41:21.705
SB 1013 A FEW YEARS AGO AND

02:41:21.772 --> 02:41:22.839
BROUGHT WINE AND SPIRITS INTO

02:41:22.906 --> 02:41:24.941
THE BOTTLE BILL, WE HAD A LOT OF

02:41:25.008 --> 02:41:26.643
CONVERSATIONS AROUND PACKAGING.

02:41:26.710 --> 02:41:28.812
WHAT CRV WAS APPROPRIATE. THIS

02:41:28.879 --> 02:41:30.647
IS ONE THAT I THINK WE REALLY

02:41:30.714 --> 02:41:31.815
NEEDED TO DO A LITTLE MORE WORK

02:41:31.882 --> 02:41:33.850
ON, TO REALLY TRY TO LAND THAT

02:41:33.917 --> 02:41:35.085
PLANE. THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.

02:41:35.152 --> 02:41:37.287
IT'S STILL ABOVE THE $0.05 THAT

02:41:37.354 --> 02:41:39.222
YOUR TRADITIONAL 12 OUNCE CAN OF

02:41:39.289 --> 02:41:41.324
SODA WOULD BE. IT'S DOUBLE THAT.

02:41:41.391 --> 02:41:43.226
BUT WE DO THINK IT'S IN LINE

02:41:43.293 --> 02:41:45.796
WITH WHAT A PRODUCT LIKE THIS

02:41:45.862 --> 02:41:46.430
COSTS FROM A PRICE PERSPECTIVE,

02:41:46.496 --> 02:41:48.298
AND WHAT PERCENTAGE THAT CRV IS

02:41:48.365 --> 02:41:50.033
OF THE TOTAL COST TO THE

02:41:50.100 --> 02:41:51.535
CONSUMER. THE ONE OTHER THING I

02:41:51.601 --> 02:41:52.769
WOULD ADD BEFORE ASKING YOU FOR

02:41:52.836 --> 02:41:55.005
YOUR SUPPORT IS, I THINK THE

02:41:55.072 --> 02:41:55.906
ANALYSIS CORRECTLY CALLS OUT

02:41:55.972 --> 02:41:57.574
THAT RIGHT NOW UNDER THE BOTTLE

02:41:57.641 --> 02:41:58.809
BILL AND MOVING FORWARD, THE

02:41:58.875 --> 02:42:00.410
GOAL IS ALWAYS FOR THE CONSUMER

02:42:00.477 --> 02:42:01.812
TO BE ABLE TO GET THE FULL

02:42:01.878 --> 02:42:03.713
AMOUNT THAT THEY PAID FOR CRV

02:42:03.780 --> 02:42:05.549
BACK IN THE REDEMPTION VALUE.

02:42:05.615 --> 02:42:07.117
THAT IS SOME OF THE TECHNICAL

02:42:07.184 --> 02:42:08.118
AMENDMENTS THAT THE SENATOR

02:42:08.185 --> 02:42:09.419
NOTED, THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH

02:42:09.486 --> 02:42:10.520
THE ADMINISTRATION AND CAL

02:42:10.587 --> 02:42:11.888
RECYCLE ON TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:42:11.955 --> 02:42:13.590
WHEN THE BILL IS IMPLEMENTED,

02:42:13.657 --> 02:42:15.225
YOU KNOW, SHOULD IT BE PASSED

02:42:15.292 --> 02:42:17.327
AND SIGNED INTO LAW, IF YOU AS

02:42:17.394 --> 02:42:17.961
THE CONSUMER PURCHASED ONE OF

02:42:18.028 --> 02:42:19.496
THESE PRODUCTS ON, LET'S SAY,

02:42:19.563 --> 02:42:21.765
DECEMBER 15TH, AND YOU PAID

02:42:21.832 --> 02:42:22.566
$0.25 AND THEN YOU REDEEMED IT

02:42:22.632 --> 02:42:24.901
ON JULY OR JULY, JANUARY 2ND,

02:42:24.968 --> 02:42:26.369
YOU KNOW, TWO WEEKS LATER TO

02:42:26.436 --> 02:42:27.604
MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S STILL A

02:42:27.671 --> 02:42:29.573
WAY FOR YOU TO RECOUP THAT FULL

02:42:29.639 --> 02:42:31.842
CRV. SO WE ARE WORKING ON THAT

02:42:31.908 --> 02:42:34.177
TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT CAN BE

02:42:34.244 --> 02:42:34.878
ADMINISTERED. WE DON'T SEE IT AS

02:42:34.945 --> 02:42:35.479
A MAJOR HURDLE IN THE

02:42:35.545 --> 02:42:36.613
LEGISLATION, MAINLY BECAUSE OF

02:42:36.680 --> 02:42:37.881
THE SELL THROUGH, HOW QUICKLY

02:42:37.948 --> 02:42:39.449
THESE PRODUCTS MOVE OFF THE

02:42:39.516 --> 02:42:41.418
SHELVES. SO FOR THAT, WE'D ASK

02:42:41.485 --> 02:42:42.519
FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND HAPPY TO

02:42:42.586 --> 02:42:44.521

AND WE ARE OPPOSED JUST REALLY

02:43:28.031 --> 02:43:29.466
QUICKLY, YOU KNOW, THE PURPOSE

02:43:29.533 --> 02:43:30.467
OF THE DEPOSIT, THE PURPOSE OF

02:43:30.534 --> 02:43:33.036
THE CRV IS TO INCENTIVIZE

02:43:33.103 --> 02:43:36.640
RECYCLING. IT'S SO THIS

02:43:36.706 --> 02:43:38.341
CONTAINER TYPE, THE ASEPTIC

02:43:38.408 --> 02:43:39.809
CONTAINERS, THEY'VE BEEN IN THE

02:43:39.876 --> 02:43:40.777
MARKET, THEY'VE BEEN IN THE

02:43:40.844 --> 02:43:42.646
BEVERAGE MARKET FOR WELL OVER 30

02:43:42.712 --> 02:43:44.481
YEARS. AND THEY AND THEY'VE

02:43:44.548 --> 02:43:46.483
NEVER BEEN PART OF A RECYCLING

02:43:46.550 --> 02:43:47.751
PROGRAM UNTIL JUST TWO YEARS

02:43:47.817 --> 02:43:49.920
AGO. AND ONLY FOR WINE AND

02:43:49.986 --> 02:43:51.821
SPIRITS. THERE'S NO THERE'S NO

02:43:51.888 --> 02:43:53.390
HISTORY OF THIS PRODUCT BEING

02:43:53.456 --> 02:43:55.225
RECYCLED. IT DOESN'T HAVE A

02:43:55.292 --> 02:43:57.194
RECYCLING RATE. I MEAN, IF TO

02:43:57.260 --> 02:43:59.029
THE DEGREE THAT THEY HAVE SIX

02:43:59.095 --> 02:44:00.263
MONTHS OF RECORDS OF RECYCLING

02:44:00.330 --> 02:44:01.998
SINCE THE PROGRAM STARTED, SINCE

02:44:02.065 --> 02:44:03.400
THEY'VE BEEN IN THE PROGRAM,

02:44:03.466 --> 02:44:04.768
IT'S AT LESS THAN 1%, OR IT'S

02:44:04.834 --> 02:44:08.638
ABOUT 1% WHEN. SO FOR, FOR THOSE

02:44:08.705 --> 02:44:10.440
REASONS, FOR THIS, FOR THAT

02:44:10.507 --> 02:44:12.209
HISTORICAL REASON, YOU KNOW, THE

02:44:12.275 --> 02:44:13.543
LEGISLATURE WHEN THEY ADDED THE

02:44:13.610 --> 02:44:15.111
ADDED WINE AND SPIRITS IN THIS

02:44:15.178 --> 02:44:17.214
PRODUCT, IN THIS CONTAINER, THEY

02:44:17.280 --> 02:44:20.150
PUT A CRV AT $0.25. RIGHTLY SO.

02:44:20.217 --> 02:44:21.685
YOU GUYS, YOU GUYS MADE A GOOD

02:44:21.751 --> 02:44:23.753
DECISION THERE TO ENCOURAGE THE

02:44:23.820 --> 02:44:25.422
CONSUMER TO RECYCLE THE PRODUCT.

02:44:25.488 --> 02:44:26.723
THAT'S THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF

02:44:26.790 --> 02:44:29.526
THE CRV IS TO DRIVE THE CONSUMER

02:44:29.593 --> 02:44:32.062
TO RECYCLE IT, NOT DOWNCYCLE IT,

02:44:32.128 --> 02:44:35.699
TO RECYCLE IT. AND, AND SO, YOU

02:44:35.765 --> 02:44:37.534
KNOW, TO REDUCE IT TO $0.10

02:44:37.601 --> 02:44:39.269
BEFORE, BEFORE IT'S SHOWN ANY

02:44:39.336 --> 02:44:40.437
EVIDENCE TO BE RECYCLED, I THINK

02:44:40.503 --> 02:44:42.405
IS PREMATURE. I'M NOT SAYING

02:44:42.472 --> 02:44:44.908
THAT $0.10 MIGHT BE THE RIGHT

02:44:44.975 --> 02:44:47.277
ANSWER AT SOME POINT, BUT MAYBE

02:44:47.344 --> 02:44:49.246
WAIT TILL THE TILL THE PRODUCT

02:44:49.312 --> 02:44:50.747
DEMONSTRATES ITS RECYCLING RATE,

02:44:50.814 --> 02:44:53.350
OR WAIT TILL THE PRODUCT ITSELF

02:44:53.416 --> 02:44:55.051
GETS A PROCESSING FEE. THERE'S

02:44:55.118 --> 02:44:56.886
NO THE PROCESSING FEE PAID FOR

02:44:56.953 --> 02:44:58.255
BY THE BEVERAGE MANUFACTURER FOR

02:44:58.321 --> 02:45:01.258
THAT PRODUCT NOW IS BASED ON A.

02:45:01.324 --> 02:45:04.060
HDPE, HDPE, A PLASTIC. BECAUSE

02:45:04.127 --> 02:45:05.495
BECAUSE THERE'S NO SCRAP VALUE

02:45:05.562 --> 02:45:06.429
FOR THE PRODUCT RIGHT NOW,

02:45:06.496 --> 02:45:07.631
THERE'S NO MEASURABLE SCRAP

02:45:07.697 --> 02:45:09.099
VALUE. AND CALRECYCLE HAS TO

02:45:09.165 --> 02:45:11.234
TAKE THE TIME TO DETERMINE THAT

02:45:11.301 --> 02:45:12.402
SCRAP VALUE, THEN DETERMINE WHAT

02:45:12.469 --> 02:45:14.537
THE WHAT THE ACTUAL COST OF

02:45:14.604 --> 02:45:15.972
RECYCLING IT IS, AND THEN ASSESS

02:45:16.039 --> 02:45:17.874
A PROCESSING FEE ON THE ON THE

02:45:17.941 --> 02:45:19.509
CONTAINER MANUFACTURER. AND

02:45:19.576 --> 02:45:21.711
UNTIL THAT HAPPENS, MAYBE DELAY

02:45:21.778 --> 02:45:23.613
ON THIS BILL. THAT'S, THAT'S

02:45:23.680 --> 02:45:24.948
THAT'S WHAT WE WOULD SUGGEST.

02:45:25.015 --> 02:45:27.884
AND, AND AS FAR AS THE, YOU

02:45:27.951 --> 02:45:29.252
KNOW, JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:45:29.319 --> 02:45:30.287
BECAUSE THERE'S SOME STATEMENTS

02:45:30.353 --> 02:45:31.688
IN THE, IN THE ANALYSIS. AND I

02:45:31.755 --> 02:45:34.591
JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I SAY IT

02:45:34.658 --> 02:45:36.026
ABOUT ABOUT AFFORDABILITY AND

02:45:36.092 --> 02:45:38.595
JUST JUST KNOW THAT IT'S A

02:45:38.662 --> 02:45:40.363
DEPOSIT. IT'S NOT A FEE. IT'S A

02:45:40.430 --> 02:45:42.232
DEPOSIT. SO THERE SHOULD BE NO

02:45:42.299 --> 02:45:43.366
AFFORDABILITY ISSUES FOR

02:45:43.433 --> 02:45:44.868
ANYBODY. BECAUSE AS LONG AS YOU

02:45:44.934 --> 02:45:46.503
RECYCLE, WHICH I RECYCLE, I

02:45:46.569 --> 02:45:47.837
THINK EVERYBODY HERE RECYCLES

02:45:47.904 --> 02:45:49.439
AND GETS THEIR NICKELS AND DIMES

02:45:49.506 --> 02:45:52.242
BACK. AND THEN THEN THERE'S NO

02:45:52.309 --> 02:45:53.743
AFFORDABILITY ISSUE. SO WITH

02:45:53.810 --> 02:45:56.946
THAT I'M ASK YOU TO MAYBE DEFER

02:45:57.013 --> 02:46:00.483
ON THIS OR AMEND IT OR VOTE NO.

02:46:00.550 --> 02:46:04.154

WORST CASE OIL SPILL. THESE ARE

02:58:47.716 --> 02:58:49.485
CRUCIAL BECAUSE PAST SPILLS HAVE

02:58:49.552 --> 02:58:52.088
REVEALED SERIOUS SHORTFALLS. THE

02:58:52.154 --> 02:58:55.925
2015 SANTA BARBARA SPILL COST

02:58:55.991 --> 02:58:57.793

OPERATORS ONLY HAD TO SHOW $30

02:59:00.096 --> 02:59:01.664
MILLION IN FINANCIAL COVERAGE.

02:59:01.730 --> 02:59:03.566
THE 2021 HUNTINGTON BEACH SPILL

02:59:03.632 --> 02:59:06.435
COST $210 MILLION, BUT THE

02:59:06.502 --> 02:59:10.005
OBLIGATION WAS JUST A SHOWING OF

02:59:10.072 --> 02:59:12.174

A SPILL DOES OCCUR, THE POLLUTER

02:59:40.669 --> 02:59:42.071

03:01:00.883 --> 03:01:02.117
I'M JUST KIDDING, MR. ELLIS. GO

03:01:02.184 --> 03:01:05.988

03:01:06.055 --> 03:01:09.291
AWARE? WELL, BEING IN THE OIL

03:01:09.358 --> 03:01:10.759
AND GAS SECTOR, FIRST OF ALL,

03:01:10.826 --> 03:01:12.494
THE WORD HYDRO TEST MEANS THAT

03:01:12.561 --> 03:01:14.496
THEY FILL THE LINE WITH WATER

03:01:14.563 --> 03:01:16.498
AND THEY PRESSURE IT TO LIKE,

03:01:16.565 --> 03:01:17.866
30% OVER ITS CAPACITY TO MAKE

03:01:17.933 --> 03:01:18.934
SURE THAT THERE AREN'T ANY

03:01:19.001 --> 03:01:20.669
LEAKS. AND THEN THEY ALSO CHECK

03:01:20.736 --> 03:01:22.037
FOR METAL THICKNESS ON A REGULAR

03:01:22.104 --> 03:01:25.774
BASIS. SO I OPPOSE THIS BILL

03:01:25.841 --> 03:01:27.509
BECAUSE IT PUTS ONEROUS

03:01:27.576 --> 03:01:29.745
RESPONSIBILITY, MORE COST ON ON

03:01:29.812 --> 03:01:32.181
THE OPERATOR, SIMPLY BECAUSE THE

03:01:32.248 --> 03:01:33.315
HYDRO TEST THE LINE ALL THE

03:01:33.382 --> 03:01:35.417
TIME. SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY

03:01:35.484 --> 03:01:37.319
YOU WHY YOU WANT TO CONTINUE TO

03:01:37.386 --> 03:01:39.455
HYDRO TEST. I CAN UNDERSTAND

03:01:39.521 --> 03:01:40.656
WAITING FIVE YEARS BUT THEY'RE

03:01:40.723 --> 03:01:42.424
GOING TO HYDRO TEST ANYWAY. SO

03:01:42.491 --> 03:01:43.726
WHY ARE YOU MAKING IT A LOT OF

03:01:43.792 --> 03:01:46.128
HYDRO TEST WHEN THEY ALREADY

03:01:46.195 --> 03:01:47.997
HAVE THE LIABILITY? THERE ARE

03:01:48.063 --> 03:01:49.732
CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT

03:01:49.798 --> 03:01:53.168
REQUIRE HYDRO TESTING THAT THAT

03:01:53.235 --> 03:01:55.437
THE BILL SUMMARY GOES THROUGH.

03:01:55.504 --> 03:01:57.273
AND THERE EVERY 5 OR 10 YEARS OR

03:01:57.339 --> 03:01:58.440
TWO YEARS, DEPENDING ON THE

03:01:58.507 --> 03:01:59.608
CIRCUMSTANCES. BUT THEY'RE NOT.

03:01:59.675 --> 03:02:01.277
WHEN A PIPELINE HAS BEEN IDLE

03:02:01.343 --> 03:02:02.878
FOR FIVE YEARS, THIS IS A NEW

03:02:02.945 --> 03:02:04.880
CIRCUMSTANCE THAT WE THINK IS

03:02:04.947 --> 03:02:06.282
DESERVING OF THAT RIGOROUS TEST

03:02:06.348 --> 03:02:08.250

GOING TO TEST IT AND CHECK THIS

03:02:12.288 --> 03:02:14.056
ANYWAY BEFORE THEY START BECAUSE

03:02:14.123 --> 03:02:16.625
THEIR OWN LIABILITY. SO ANYWAY

03:02:16.692 --> 03:02:19.495

CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE CAN IMPACT

COMMUNITIES WITH IMMEASURABLE

03:05:59.348 --> 03:06:01.583
DAMAGE. WHAT WE RECENTLY

03:06:01.650 --> 03:06:03.218
EXPERIENCED WITH THE EATON AND

03:06:03.285 --> 03:06:05.787
PALISADES FIRE ARE TWO OF TWO OF

03:06:05.854 --> 03:06:07.022
THE TOP THREE MOST DESTRUCTIVE

03:06:07.089 --> 03:06:08.290

03:09:56.952 --> 03:09:57.986
COMMITTEE MEMBERS, MEMBERS OF

03:09:58.053 --> 03:09:58.887
THE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE

03:09:58.954 --> 03:10:01.690
NOW WOULD BE A GREAT TIME TO

03:10:01.757 --> 03:10:02.424
MAKE YOUR WAY BACK TO THE

03:10:02.491 --> 03:10:03.558
COMMITTEE ROOM. WE'RE ON OUR

03:10:03.625 --> 03:10:04.826
LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST,

03:10:04.893 --> 03:10:07.729
BILL. AND THAT WOULD BE SENATOR

CABALLERO. PERFECT. ALL RIGHT.

03:10:10.398 --> 03:10:12.801
LET'S. WORKS. GOOD FOR YEARS.

03:10:12.868 --> 03:10:15.704
OKAY. THANKS, SENATOR. WELCOME.

03:10:15.771 --> 03:10:18.807

NICE SHOES. OH. THANK YOU. I'M

03:10:21.409 --> 03:10:31.920
READY FOR WHATEVER. THANK YOU,

03:10:31.987 --> 03:10:33.755
MR. CHAIR. AND MEMBERS, I'M

03:10:33.822 --> 03:10:36.258
PLEASED TO PRESENT SB 643, WHICH

03:10:36.324 --> 03:10:37.626
DIRECTS THE CALIFORNIA AIR

03:10:37.692 --> 03:10:40.162
RESOURCES BOARD TO ADMINISTER A

03:10:40.228 --> 03:10:40.862
COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM FOR

03:10:40.929 --> 03:10:44.533
CARBON DIOXIDE, CARBON DIOXIDE

03:10:44.599 --> 03:10:46.268
REMOVAL PROJECTS. AS YOU KNOW,

03:10:46.334 --> 03:10:47.636
CLIMATE CHANGE POSES A SEVERE

03:10:47.702 --> 03:10:49.538
THREAT TO CALIFORNIANS AS A

03:10:49.604 --> 03:10:51.339
RESULTED IN DISRUPTIONS TO THE

03:10:51.406 --> 03:10:52.474
STATE'S COMMUNITIES, ENVIRONMENT

03:10:52.541 --> 03:10:55.911
AND ECONOMY. CARBON DIOXIDE

03:10:55.977 --> 03:10:57.312
REMOVAL REFERS TO REMOVING

03:10:57.379 --> 03:10:59.114
CARBON DIOXIDE FROM THE

03:10:59.181 --> 03:11:00.282
ATMOSPHERE AND PERMANENTLY

03:11:00.348 --> 03:11:03.084
STORING IT IN A SAFE, SECURE

03:11:03.151 --> 03:11:04.986
LOCATION, SUCH AS UNDERGROUND

03:11:05.053 --> 03:11:06.721
GEOLOGIC FORMATIONS OR IN

03:11:06.788 --> 03:11:08.123
CEMENT. THIS IS NOT THE SAME

03:11:08.190 --> 03:11:10.659
THING AS CARBON CAPTURE, WHICH

03:11:10.725 --> 03:11:12.194
CAPTURES CO2 FROM THE

03:11:12.260 --> 03:11:13.128
SMOKESTACKS OF EXISTING

03:11:13.195 --> 03:11:14.696
INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES THAT BURN

03:11:14.763 --> 03:11:16.932
FOSSIL FUELS. AS YOU ARE AWARE,

03:11:16.998 --> 03:11:18.967
THE STATE'S GOAL IS TO ACHIEVE

03:11:19.034 --> 03:11:21.203
NET ZERO GREENHOUSE GAS

03:11:21.269 --> 03:11:23.305
EMISSIONS NO LATER THAN 2045.

03:11:23.371 --> 03:11:25.440
THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES

03:11:25.507 --> 03:11:28.643
BOARD 2022 SCOPING PLAN STATES

03:11:28.710 --> 03:11:30.445
THAT THERE, QUOTE, THERE IS NO

03:11:30.512 --> 03:11:32.347
PATH TO CARBON NEUTRALITY

03:11:32.414 --> 03:11:34.983
WITHOUT CARBON REMOVAL AND

03:11:35.050 --> 03:11:36.651
SEQUESTRATION. END OF QUOTE AND

03:11:36.718 --> 03:11:38.720
ESTABLISHED STATE CDR TARGETS OF

03:11:38.787 --> 03:11:40.355
7 MILLION METRIC TONS ANNUALLY

03:11:40.422 --> 03:11:43.358
BY 2030 AND 75 MILLION METRIC

03:11:43.425 --> 03:11:45.060
TONS ANNUALLY BY 2045. OVER THE

03:11:45.126 --> 03:11:46.661
LAST SEVERAL YEARS, A SMALL

03:11:46.728 --> 03:11:48.864
NUMBER OF COMPANIES HAVE

03:11:48.930 --> 03:11:50.165
VOLUNTARILY VOLUNTARILY

03:11:50.232 --> 03:11:51.967
PURCHASED CDR REMOVALS AS PART

03:11:52.033 --> 03:11:54.569
OF THEIR CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS

03:11:54.636 --> 03:11:55.904
TO DATE, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A

03:11:55.971 --> 03:11:57.806
PILOT FACILITY IN TRACY, NONE OF

03:11:57.873 --> 03:11:59.875
THE CDR REMOVALS HAVE OCCURRED

03:11:59.941 --> 03:12:02.177
IN CALIFORNIA, AND THAT PILOT

03:12:02.244 --> 03:12:04.579
PROGRAM, BY THE WAY, WAS PILOTED

03:12:04.646 --> 03:12:08.316
BY YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS IN FROM

03:12:08.383 --> 03:12:10.252
CALIFORNIA WHO HAVE DEVELOPED

03:12:10.318 --> 03:12:11.486
THE TECHNOLOGY. BUT IN

03:12:11.553 --> 03:12:12.821
RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT

03:12:12.888 --> 03:12:17.092
THAT THEY NEEDED IN ORDER TO

03:12:17.158 --> 03:12:18.827
MONETIZE A FACILITY, THEY NEEDED

03:12:18.894 --> 03:12:20.595
IT TO BE BUILT QUICKLY. THEY

03:12:20.662 --> 03:12:23.231
WENT TO ANOTHER STATE IN ORDER

03:12:23.298 --> 03:12:24.399
TO DO THAT PROJECT. SO THE PILOT

03:12:24.466 --> 03:12:26.568
FACILITY WORKS IN TRACY, AND I'D

03:12:26.635 --> 03:12:27.469
RECOMMEND THAT IF YOU HAVEN'T

03:12:27.535 --> 03:12:29.871
HAD A CHANCE TO GO BY AND CHECK

03:12:29.938 --> 03:12:31.239
IT OUT TO DO SO, IT'S

03:12:31.306 --> 03:12:34.509
INCREDIBLE. SO THERE'S THAT

03:12:34.576 --> 03:12:36.378
PILOT FACILITY AND TRACY. BUT

03:12:36.444 --> 03:12:38.246
SINCE THEN, THE STATE HAS NOT

03:12:38.313 --> 03:12:39.881
DEVELOPED PATHWAYS TO ACHIEVE

03:12:39.948 --> 03:12:41.650
CARB CDR TARGET, AND THE CLOCK

03:12:41.716 --> 03:12:43.485
IS TICKING. IF THE STATE IS TO

03:12:43.551 --> 03:12:44.886
MEET OUR CARBON NEUTRALITY GOAL,

03:12:44.953 --> 03:12:47.155
THERE NEEDS TO BE A SIGNIFICANT

03:12:47.222 --> 03:12:47.956
ACCELERATION IN CDR DEPLOYMENT.

03:12:48.023 --> 03:12:49.925
AND THAT'S WHERE THIS BILL COMES

03:12:49.991 --> 03:12:51.459
IN TO MEET THE URGENT DEMAND TO

03:12:51.526 --> 03:12:53.495
REACH THAT NEUTRALITY BY 2045.

03:12:53.561 --> 03:12:55.730
THIS BILL ESTABLISHES THE CARBON

03:12:55.797 --> 03:12:57.632
DIOXIDE REMOVAL PILOT PROGRAM

03:12:57.699 --> 03:13:00.402
UNDER CARB, AND DIRECTS CARB TO

03:13:00.468 --> 03:13:02.037
PROVIDE UP TO 50 MILLION IN

03:13:02.103 --> 03:13:04.039
COMPETITIVE GRANTS. ELIGIBLE

03:13:04.105 --> 03:13:05.707
PROJECTS INCLUDE FOR CARBON

03:13:05.774 --> 03:13:07.943
REMOVAL PATHWAYS, DIRECT AIR

03:13:08.009 --> 03:13:09.711
CAPTURE, BIOMASS CARBON REMOVAL,

03:13:09.778 --> 03:13:11.646
ENHANCED MINERALIZATION AND

03:13:11.713 --> 03:13:13.415
MARINE CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL

03:13:13.481 --> 03:13:16.651
AND STORAGE. WHEN SELECTING CDR

03:13:16.718 --> 03:13:18.086
PROJECTS, CARB MUST PRIORITIZE

03:13:18.153 --> 03:13:21.723
THE POTENTIAL TO ACCELERATE CDR

03:13:21.790 --> 03:13:22.924
STRATEGIES. THE DISTRIBUTION OF

03:13:22.991 --> 03:13:24.492
THE PROGRAM FUNDS ACROSS

03:13:24.559 --> 03:13:26.361
MULTIPLE GEOGRAPHIES AND PROJECT

03:13:26.428 --> 03:13:27.796
TYPES, AND THE STRENGTH OF

03:13:27.862 --> 03:13:29.631
COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLANS. THOSE

03:13:29.698 --> 03:13:32.067
ARE ALL REQUIRED. COMMUNITY

03:13:32.133 --> 03:13:33.335
BENEFIT PLANS WILL HELP ENSURE

03:13:33.401 --> 03:13:35.337
THAT THE BENEFIT OF THE PROJECTS

03:13:35.403 --> 03:13:37.138
ARE RETURNED TO THE SURROUNDING

03:13:37.205 --> 03:13:38.506
COMMUNITIES. THE BILL ALSO

03:13:38.573 --> 03:13:39.975
REQUIRES PROJECTS TO BE

03:13:40.041 --> 03:13:42.177
PHYSICALLY LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA

03:13:42.243 --> 03:13:44.379
AND SETS OUT PROJECT SAFEGUARDS,

03:13:44.446 --> 03:13:46.848
INCLUDING THAT IT BE ADDITIONAL,

03:13:46.915 --> 03:13:49.651
DURABLE AND VERIFIED BY

03:13:49.718 --> 03:13:51.653
ACCELERATING CDR DEVELOPMENT AND

03:13:51.720 --> 03:13:52.887
DEPLOYMENT. THE BILL IS AN

03:13:52.954 --> 03:13:53.989
INTEGRAL STEP TO REMOVE CARBON

03:13:54.055 --> 03:13:55.991
DIOXIDE FROM THE ATMOSPHERE TO

03:13:56.057 --> 03:13:58.393
MEET THE STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS.

03:13:58.460 --> 03:14:00.462
SO WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN

03:14:00.528 --> 03:14:01.763
SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS DOCTOR

03:14:01.830 --> 03:14:04.099
BOB EPSTEIN WITH PROJECT 2030

03:14:04.165 --> 03:14:06.501
AND HALEY LESLIE BOYLE FROM THE

03:14:06.568 --> 03:14:09.637
WORLD RESOURCE INSTITUTE. TWO

03:14:09.704 --> 03:14:11.773
MINUTES EACH. OKAY. THANK YOU.

03:14:11.840 --> 03:14:13.141
GOOD AFTERNOON OR EVENING? I'M

03:14:13.208 --> 03:14:16.044
NOT SURE I'M BOB EPSTEIN. I'M A

03:14:16.111 --> 03:14:17.412
CALIFORNIA ENTREPRENEUR AND

03:14:17.479 --> 03:14:18.747
CO-FOUNDER OF PROJECT 2030.

03:14:18.813 --> 03:14:20.749
WE'RE ONE OF THE WE ARE THE

03:14:20.815 --> 03:14:24.686
SPONSOR OF SB 643. AFTER

03:14:24.753 --> 03:14:26.421
COMPLETING MY PHD IN ENGINEERING

03:14:26.488 --> 03:14:29.324
AT UC BERKELEY, I. I CO-FOUNDED

03:14:29.391 --> 03:14:31.493
FOUR SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES IN

03:14:31.559 --> 03:14:33.628
CALIFORNIA. AND FOR THE LAST 25

03:14:33.695 --> 03:14:35.764
YEARS, I FOCUSED MY VOLUNTEER

03:14:35.830 --> 03:14:37.699
TIME HELPING ADVANCE THE CLIMATE

03:14:37.766 --> 03:14:39.534
POLICIES IN THE STATE OF

03:14:39.601 --> 03:14:40.535
CALIFORNIA, STARTING WITH THE

03:14:40.602 --> 03:14:43.805
FIRST PAVLEY BILL IN 2002. OVER

03:14:43.872 --> 03:14:45.306
THE LAST FIVE YEARS, THERE'S

03:14:45.373 --> 03:14:48.143
BEEN A GLOBAL, VOLUNTARY, MULTI,

03:14:48.209 --> 03:14:50.979
MULTI BILLION DOLLAR CDR MARKET

03:14:51.046 --> 03:14:52.414
DEVELOPED BY JUST A HANDFUL OF

03:14:52.480 --> 03:14:54.115
COMPANIES WHO ARE PURCHASING.

03:14:54.182 --> 03:14:55.350
IT'S A VOLUNTARY MARKET RIGHT

03:14:55.417 --> 03:14:57.819
NOW THAT HAS NO REASON TO

03:14:57.886 --> 03:15:00.255
PRIORITIZE. CALIFORNIA. LAST

03:15:00.321 --> 03:15:03.558
WEEK I SAW A VERY DISTURBING

03:15:03.625 --> 03:15:06.728
HEADLINE. IT READ INSIDE CAL

03:15:06.795 --> 03:15:08.530
CANADA'S QUIET TAKEOVER OF THE

03:15:08.596 --> 03:15:10.799
CARBON CAPTURE INDUSTRY. WHILE

03:15:10.865 --> 03:15:12.934
THE US CLIMATE TECH SCENE

03:15:13.001 --> 03:15:14.369
STUMBLES THROUGH POLITICAL

03:15:14.436 --> 03:15:16.471
GRIDLOCK, CANADA IS QUIETLY

03:15:16.538 --> 03:15:18.640
PULLING OFF A GLOBAL POWER PLAY

03:15:18.706 --> 03:15:20.675
IN CARBON REMOVAL, AND INVESTORS

03:15:20.742 --> 03:15:23.445
ARE TAKING NOTICE, UNQUOTE. I

03:15:23.511 --> 03:15:26.581
BEG TO DIFFER, AND I OFFER 643

03:15:26.648 --> 03:15:29.384
AS PROOF. FOR EXAMPLE, LAST

03:15:29.451 --> 03:15:31.653
YEAR, CANADA ANNOUNCED A $10

03:15:31.719 --> 03:15:33.755
MILLION CDR PURCHASE PROGRAM,

03:15:33.822 --> 03:15:36.658
GOT ABOUT 40 RESPONSES.

03:15:36.724 --> 03:15:38.226
CALIFORNIA'S PROGRAM, BY

03:15:38.293 --> 03:15:40.261
CONTRAST, WILL BE TEN TIMES THAT

03:15:40.328 --> 03:15:42.831
SIZE, STARTING WITH $50 MILLION

03:15:42.897 --> 03:15:44.566
INVESTMENT BY THE STATE, WITH AN

03:15:44.632 --> 03:15:46.701
ADDITIONAL REQUIRED $50 MILLION

03:15:46.768 --> 03:15:48.770
FROM PRIVATE SECTOR, RESULTING

03:15:48.837 --> 03:15:51.072
IN $100 MILLION CDR OF PROJECTS

03:15:51.139 --> 03:15:53.174
THAT HAVE TO BE BUILT IN

03:15:53.241 --> 03:15:55.343
CALIFORNIA IN ORDER TO QUALIFY.

03:15:55.410 --> 03:15:57.078
ONE OTHER IMPORTANT BUDGET NOTE

03:15:57.145 --> 03:15:59.147
IN RESPONSE TO CARB'S REQUEST,

03:15:59.214 --> 03:16:01.850
THE CDR PROGRAM IN THE CURRENT

03:16:01.916 --> 03:16:03.585
DRAFT HAS BEEN SIMPLIFIED AND WE

03:16:03.651 --> 03:16:06.187
EXPECT THEY WOULD REDUCE THEIR

03:16:06.254 --> 03:16:07.255
IMPLEMENTATION COSTS WHEN THAT'S

03:16:07.322 --> 03:16:10.525
REPORTED OUT. IN SUMMARY,

03:16:10.592 --> 03:16:11.893
CALIFORNIA, WE CAN MEET OUR

03:16:11.960 --> 03:16:13.828
CARBON REMOVAL GOALS, ATTRACT A

03:16:13.895 --> 03:16:16.231
GROWING $3 BILLION MARKET

03:16:16.297 --> 03:16:18.399
ALREADY STARTED. BRING IT TO

03:16:18.466 --> 03:16:19.734
CALIFORNIA. WE CAN DO ALL THIS

03:16:19.801 --> 03:16:21.302
AND INCLUDE CRITICAL GUARDRAILS

03:16:21.369 --> 03:16:23.404
NEEDED TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S

03:16:23.471 --> 03:16:24.806
COMMUNITIES, LIKE STOCKTON,

03:16:24.873 --> 03:16:26.641
WHERE I WAS BORN AND RAISED.

03:16:26.708 --> 03:16:28.510
MANY OF THE CARBON REMOVAL

03:16:28.576 --> 03:16:30.245
STARTUPS COMPANIES STARTED IN

03:16:30.311 --> 03:16:31.346
CALIFORNIA. THEY HAVE THEIR

03:16:31.412 --> 03:16:32.814
SCIENCE TEAMS. WE HAVE THE

03:16:32.881 --> 03:16:34.716
NATIONAL LABS, UNIVERSITIES,

03:16:34.782 --> 03:16:37.118
INVESTORS, NGOS. BUT MOST

03:16:37.185 --> 03:16:38.953
IMPORTANTLY, WE HAVE TWO THINGS.

03:16:39.020 --> 03:16:40.722
WE HAVE THE PEOPLE, THE

03:16:40.788 --> 03:16:42.190
STRENGTH, AND WE HAVE THE

03:16:42.257 --> 03:16:43.558
REQUIREMENT TO GET THIS MOVING

EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS AND MEET

03:17:15.590 --> 03:17:18.226
THE STATE'S NET ZERO GOAL. BUT

03:17:18.293 --> 03:17:20.028
TO DELIVER THE 75 MILLION METRIC

03:17:20.094 --> 03:17:22.197
TONS OF REMOVAL THE PLAN CALLS

03:17:22.263 --> 03:17:23.598

03:17:32.006 --> 03:17:34.075
IN SUPPORTING RESPONSIBLE CARBON

03:17:34.142 --> 03:17:35.843
REMOVAL ACROSS A PORTFOLIO OF

03:17:35.910 --> 03:17:37.579
APPROACHES BEYOND CLIMATE

03:17:37.645 --> 03:17:39.080
BENEFITS. THIS BILL OFFERS

03:17:39.147 --> 03:17:41.015
ECONOMIC AND COMMUNITY

03:17:41.082 --> 03:17:42.717
OPPORTUNITIES. A REPORT

03:17:42.784 --> 03:17:44.052
PUBLISHED THIS YEAR BY THE

03:17:44.118 --> 03:17:45.486
RHODIUM GROUP ESTIMATES THAT

03:17:45.553 --> 03:17:47.956
SCALING THESE APPROACHES TO 100

03:17:48.022 --> 03:17:49.490
MILLION TONS OF REMOVAL PER YEAR

03:17:49.557 --> 03:17:53.094
COULD SUPPORT UP TO 130,000 JOBS

03:17:53.161 --> 03:17:54.929
ANNUALLY. WITH THIS BILL,

03:17:54.996 --> 03:17:56.464
CALIFORNIA CAN BECOME A HUB FOR

03:17:56.531 --> 03:17:58.132
CLIMATE INNOVATION AND CLIMATE

03:17:58.199 --> 03:18:00.335
FRIENDLY JOBS. IT ALSO GIVES

03:18:00.401 --> 03:18:02.103
CARB THE TOOLS TO PRIORITIZE

03:18:02.170 --> 03:18:03.471
PROJECTS THAT DELIVER BROADER

03:18:03.538 --> 03:18:06.007
COMMUNITY BENEFITS. NOW THAT

03:18:06.074 --> 03:18:08.543
SAID, CDR SCALING MUST COME WITH

03:18:08.610 --> 03:18:10.445
STRONG SAFEGUARDS. THIS IS

03:18:10.511 --> 03:18:11.879
ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR BIOMASS

03:18:11.946 --> 03:18:13.982
CARBON REMOVAL, WHICH WAS MY

03:18:14.048 --> 03:18:14.816
AREA OF EXPERTISE. AND TO BE

03:18:14.882 --> 03:18:16.784
CLEAR, THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT

03:18:16.851 --> 03:18:19.754
THAN THE OLD DIRTY BIOMASS

03:18:19.821 --> 03:18:23.658
ENERGY THAT HAS CREATED DAMAGE

03:18:23.725 --> 03:18:26.294
IN COMMUNITIES AND TO THE

03:18:26.361 --> 03:18:28.696
ENVIRONMENT ACROSS THE US. SO

03:18:28.763 --> 03:18:30.932
THIS BILL INCLUDES CRITICAL

03:18:30.999 --> 03:18:33.034
PROTECTIONS. IT LIMITS ELIGIBLE

03:18:33.101 --> 03:18:34.502
FEEDSTOCKS TO WASTE AND RESIDUES

03:18:34.569 --> 03:18:36.871
LIKE ALMOND HULLS OR MATERIAL

03:18:36.938 --> 03:18:38.773
FROM WILDFIRE TREATMENTS, WHICH

03:18:38.840 --> 03:18:40.308
ENSURES THAT CARBON REMOVAL DOES

03:18:40.375 --> 03:18:41.776
NOT COMPETE WITH FOOD

03:18:41.843 --> 03:18:42.710
PRODUCTION, DRIVE LAND USE

03:18:42.777 --> 03:18:44.979
CHANGE OR INCREASE EMISSIONS.

03:18:45.046 --> 03:18:46.481
THIS FOCUS ON WASTE BIOMASS

03:18:46.547 --> 03:18:48.449
MEANS PROJECTS CAN ALSO REDUCE

03:18:48.516 --> 03:18:50.718
WILDFIRE RISK AND AIR POLLUTION.

03:18:50.785 --> 03:18:51.953
I'VE WORKED WITH A NUMBER OF

03:18:52.020 --> 03:18:53.588
RURAL COMMUNITIES ACROSS

03:18:53.655 --> 03:18:55.790
CALIFORNIA, INCLUDING TRIBAL

03:18:55.857 --> 03:18:57.058

03:18:57.125 --> 03:18:58.626
SEE CARBON REMOVAL PROJECTS PUT

03:18:58.693 --> 03:19:00.295
THEIR BIOMASS TO GOOD USE

03:19:00.361 --> 03:19:02.563
INSTEAD OF PILE BURNING IT OR

03:19:02.630 --> 03:19:04.699
PUTTING IT INTO OLD, POLLUTING

03:19:04.766 --> 03:19:06.934
BIOMASS ENERGY FACILITIES.

03:19:07.001 --> 03:19:09.037
APPROACHES LIKE BIOMASS OR

03:19:09.103 --> 03:19:10.438
BIOMASS TO HYDROGEN CAN DELIVER

03:19:10.505 --> 03:19:12.473
DURABLE CLIMATE REMOVAL BENEFITS

03:19:12.540 --> 03:19:13.708
WHILE SUPPORTING HEALTHIER,

03:19:13.775 --> 03:19:15.543
SAFER COMMUNITIES AND

03:19:15.610 --> 03:19:17.045
POTENTIALLY INCREASING CROP

03:19:17.111 --> 03:19:18.446
YIELD AND SOIL HEALTH. AND

03:19:18.513 --> 03:19:19.847
BIOCHAR IS APPLIED TO FIELDS.

03:19:19.914 --> 03:19:21.282
THIS BILL WOULD HELP HIGH

03:19:21.349 --> 03:19:22.784
INTEGRITY CARBON REMOVAL SCALE

03:23:47.214 --> 03:23:49.116
QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS MR.

03:23:49.183 --> 03:23:52.620
ELLIS. THANK YOU SENATOR. MR.

03:23:52.687 --> 03:23:53.354
CHAIRMAN, FOR BRINGING THIS

03:23:53.421 --> 03:23:58.359
FORWARD BECAUSE. I WAS IN THE

03:23:58.426 --> 03:24:00.227
QUANTUM BUSINESS ABOUT 14 YEARS

03:24:00.294 --> 03:24:02.029
AGO AND I OWNED A QUANTUM

03:24:02.096 --> 03:24:03.898
NETWORKING COMPANY, AND WE WOULD

03:24:03.965 --> 03:24:06.334
HAVE NEVER GOT OUR FEET OFF THE

03:24:06.400 --> 03:24:08.569
GROUND HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR

03:24:08.636 --> 03:24:09.604
SUPPORT FROM THE FEDERAL

03:24:09.670 --> 03:24:11.405
GOVERNMENT. AND SOME STATES,

03:24:11.472 --> 03:24:12.807
UNFORTUNATELY, OTHER STATES BEAT

03:24:12.873 --> 03:24:14.375
US TO IT, AND THEY'RE THE

03:24:14.442 --> 03:24:15.810
LEADERS. WE NEED TO BE THE

03:24:15.876 --> 03:24:18.546
LEADER IN CO2. AND I LOVE NEW

03:24:18.613 --> 03:24:20.481
TECHNOLOGY. I'M ALL ABOUT IT. SO

03:24:20.548 --> 03:24:22.950
I COMMEND YOU BOTH, ALL OF YOU.

03:24:23.017 --> 03:24:23.618
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU,

03:24:23.684 --> 03:24:28.689
MR. MURATSUCHI. THANK YOU. I, I

03:24:28.756 --> 03:24:32.994
AM ALL FOR INCENTIVIZING CARBON

03:24:33.060 --> 03:24:36.230
DIOXIDE REMOVAL PROJECTS IN THE

03:24:36.297 --> 03:24:38.699
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. UNTIL I

03:24:38.766 --> 03:24:41.669
HEARD THAT THIS INCLUDED

03:24:41.736 --> 03:24:44.105
BIOMASS. AND, YOU KNOW, I KNOW

03:24:44.171 --> 03:24:48.542
THAT. YOU KNOW, YOU

03:24:48.609 --> 03:24:54.215
DISTINGUISHED. WHAT YOU CLAIM

03:24:54.281 --> 03:24:57.385
THAT THIS IS NOT YOUR, YOU KNOW,

03:24:57.451 --> 03:24:59.920
FORMER VERSIONS OF BIOMASS

03:24:59.987 --> 03:25:02.890
ENERGY GENERATIONS. SENATOR

03:25:02.957 --> 03:25:04.358
CABALLERO, I HEARD YOU SAYING AT

03:25:04.425 --> 03:25:05.660
THE BEGINNING THAT THIS IS

03:25:05.726 --> 03:25:08.229
DIFFERENT FROM THE CARBON

03:25:08.295 --> 03:25:10.431
CAPTURE. I THINK YOU WERE

03:25:10.498 --> 03:25:13.668
REFERRING TO THE MECHANICAL

03:25:13.734 --> 03:25:15.803
CARBON CAPTURE LIKE PROPOSED

03:25:15.870 --> 03:25:20.141
WITH REFINERIES, BUT THE BIOMASS

03:25:20.207 --> 03:25:22.643
ENERGY, HOW WOULD THAT BE

03:25:22.710 --> 03:25:24.245
DIFFERENT FROM THE MECHANICAL

03:25:24.311 --> 03:25:27.014
CARBON CAPTURE? I'LL LET THE

03:25:27.081 --> 03:25:28.949
EXPERT TALK ABOUT IT, BECAUSE

03:25:29.016 --> 03:25:33.387
I'VE SEEN THERE HAVE BEEN NEW

03:25:33.454 --> 03:25:36.657
NEW INNOVATIONS IN THE PROCESS.

03:25:36.724 --> 03:25:38.926
AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE

03:25:38.993 --> 03:25:41.696
IGNITION IS DIFFERENT AND THE

03:25:41.762 --> 03:25:44.165
WAY THAT THE WASTE PRODUCT IS

03:25:44.231 --> 03:25:45.833
HANDLED IS DIFFERENT AND YOU

03:25:45.900 --> 03:25:49.236
DON'T. IT'S SO MAYBE, MAYBE

03:25:49.303 --> 03:25:51.005
LETTING THE MORE TECHNICAL

03:25:51.072 --> 03:25:52.907
PEOPLE EXPLAIN WOULD BE. SURE,

03:25:52.973 --> 03:25:54.842
SURE. THERE'S TWO ISSUES. ONE IS

03:25:54.909 --> 03:25:56.877
WHAT'S THE SOURCE OF BIOMASS. SO

03:25:56.944 --> 03:26:01.015
THIS BILL IS EXPLICIT. IT NEEDS

03:26:01.082 --> 03:26:03.651
TO BE RESIDUES. SO YOU KNOW

03:26:03.718 --> 03:26:05.986
THAT'S YOUR HOLES FROM FROM THE

03:26:06.053 --> 03:26:08.055
ALMOND INDUSTRY OR AFTER THE

03:26:08.122 --> 03:26:09.457
STATE HAS DONE A FORCE

03:26:09.523 --> 03:26:10.558
TREATMENT, THE LEFTOVER WASTE

03:26:10.624 --> 03:26:12.827
THAT'S CURRENTLY A PILE. SO

03:26:12.893 --> 03:26:13.928
THAT'S THAT'S THE FIRST THING

03:26:13.994 --> 03:26:15.996
THAT'S IMPORTANT. THIS IS NOT

03:26:16.063 --> 03:26:18.599
GROWING STUFF TO USE IT WHICH,

03:26:18.666 --> 03:26:20.668
WHICH WHICH WE'RE OPPOSED TO AS

03:26:20.735 --> 03:26:22.103
WELL. THE SECOND THING IS

03:26:22.169 --> 03:26:24.505
THERE'S NO COMBUSTION INVOLVED.

03:26:24.572 --> 03:26:26.574
SO INSTEAD THE ONLY THINGS THAT

03:26:26.640 --> 03:26:28.275
WORK, IF YOU'RE TRYING TO

03:26:28.342 --> 03:26:31.045
MAXIMIZE THE CO2, YOU DON'T WANT

03:26:31.112 --> 03:26:33.080
ANY COMBUSTION. INSTEAD IT'S

03:26:33.147 --> 03:26:34.415
EITHER PYROLYSIS OR

03:26:34.482 --> 03:26:36.283
GASIFICATION, WHICH MEANS IN A

03:26:36.350 --> 03:26:39.019
SEALED CONTAINER WITH NO OXYGEN,

03:26:39.086 --> 03:26:41.522
THE MATERIAL IS HEATED TO 500

03:26:41.589 --> 03:26:43.257
DEGREES OR UP TO A THOUSAND

03:26:43.324 --> 03:26:44.525
DEGREES. THAT SEPARATES IT OUT.

03:26:44.592 --> 03:26:46.961
AND I'LL LET HALEY TAKE IT FROM

03:26:47.027 --> 03:26:48.863
THERE. YEAH. AND I JUST WANT TO

03:26:48.929 --> 03:26:51.365
SAY MY ORGANIZATION ABSOLUTELY

03:26:51.432 --> 03:26:53.100
SHARES YOUR CONCERNS. WE'VE BEEN

03:26:53.167 --> 03:26:54.869
VERY VOCALLY AGAINST BIOENERGY

03:26:54.935 --> 03:26:56.837
AND FIRST GENERATION BIOFUELS.

03:26:56.904 --> 03:26:58.873
AND I THINK WHAT'S DIFFERENT

03:26:58.939 --> 03:26:59.874
ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS

03:26:59.940 --> 03:27:02.409
EXACTLY WHAT BOB SAID. IT'S THE

03:27:02.476 --> 03:27:03.544
FEEDSTOCKS, ONLY WASTE AND

03:27:03.611 --> 03:27:08.549
RESIDUES. IT'S ALSO IT'S MAKING

03:27:08.616 --> 03:27:09.917
ENERGY FROM BIOMASS AND THEN

03:27:09.984 --> 03:27:12.486
PUTTING A CARBON CAPTURE

03:27:12.553 --> 03:27:14.188
ADDITION ON IS VERY EXPENSIVE

03:27:14.255 --> 03:27:15.422
AND NOT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING

03:27:15.489 --> 03:27:17.291
TO BE HAPPENING WITH THIS BILL.

03:27:17.358 --> 03:27:18.425
WHAT'S MUCH MORE LIKELY TO

03:27:18.492 --> 03:27:20.828
HAPPEN IS TO SEE HYDROGEN

03:27:20.895 --> 03:27:22.263
PRODUCTION, BIOCHAR PRODUCTION.

03:27:22.329 --> 03:27:24.431
THERE ARE A LOT OF FORMS OF

03:27:24.498 --> 03:27:25.966
BIOMASS CARBON REMOVAL, EVEN

03:27:26.033 --> 03:27:27.635
SUCH AS BIOMASS BURIAL, THAT

03:27:27.701 --> 03:27:29.804
REQUIRE NO HEAT AT ALL. THAT'S

03:27:29.870 --> 03:27:31.572
SIMPLY PUTTING BIOMASS IN A

03:27:31.639 --> 03:27:34.275
SEALED AND MONITORED PIT, OR

03:27:34.341 --> 03:27:35.643
MAKING BIOCHAR. THERE ARE A LOT

03:27:35.709 --> 03:27:37.478
OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO THIS

03:27:37.545 --> 03:27:38.879
THAT ARE VERY, VERY SAFE AND

03:27:38.946 --> 03:27:41.382
QUITE PROVEN. SO JUST WANT TO

03:27:41.448 --> 03:27:43.284
ACKNOWLEDGE, YOU KNOW, WHAT WE

03:27:43.350 --> 03:27:44.585
HEARD. AND I THINK WE SHARE A

03:27:44.652 --> 03:27:45.820
LOT OF THOSE CONCERNS. MY

03:27:45.886 --> 03:27:47.121
ORGANIZATION SEES IT

03:27:47.188 --> 03:27:49.523
DIFFERENTLY. OKAY. AND THEN A

03:27:49.590 --> 03:27:50.724
QUESTION FOR THE CENTER FOR

03:27:50.791 --> 03:27:52.593
BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY I YOU KNOW

03:27:52.660 --> 03:27:58.432
I. WAS WORKING WITH AL-TUSI TO

03:27:58.499 --> 03:28:01.869
PROMOTE A, YOU KNOW, PROJECTS

03:28:01.936 --> 03:28:06.974
LIKE WHAT WE HAVE AT UCLA TO, TO

03:28:07.041 --> 03:28:11.212
TRY TO INVEST AND, AND

03:28:11.278 --> 03:28:12.813
INCENTIVIZE THE DEVELOPMENT OF

03:28:12.880 --> 03:28:15.516
MARINE CARBON CAPTURE, MARINE

03:28:15.583 --> 03:28:19.753
CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL PROJECT.

03:28:19.820 --> 03:28:23.757
AND, YOU KNOW, I HEARD WHAT YOUR

03:28:23.824 --> 03:28:26.360
TESTIMONY IN TERMS OF THE

03:28:26.427 --> 03:28:28.562
CONCERNS ABOUT IMPACTS ON ON THE

03:28:28.629 --> 03:28:33.167
MARINE ECOSYSTEM. I, I GUESS

03:28:33.234 --> 03:28:36.470
I'M, YOU KNOW, IT DOES THE

03:28:36.537 --> 03:28:38.072
CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY,

03:28:38.138 --> 03:28:41.508
YOU KNOW, DISAGREE WITH THE IPCC

03:28:41.575 --> 03:28:43.143
SAYING THAT THAT WE DO NEED TO

03:28:43.210 --> 03:28:46.547
HAVE CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL IN,

03:28:46.614 --> 03:28:48.048
ESPECIALLY IN THE HEART OF BAY

03:28:48.115 --> 03:28:49.717
SECTORS IN ORDER TO MEET OUR

03:28:49.783 --> 03:28:51.952
CLIMATE GOALS. MAY I RESPOND TO

03:28:52.019 --> 03:28:53.053
THAT AS WELL? THE PRIOR

03:28:53.120 --> 03:28:54.521
QUESTION, MAYBE IF YOU CAN

03:28:54.588 --> 03:28:55.856
ANSWER MY QUESTION FIRST AND

03:28:55.923 --> 03:28:57.291
THEN WE DON'T. THERE ARE

03:28:57.358 --> 03:28:58.726
PATHWAYS WITHOUT BIOMASS, IPC

03:28:58.792 --> 03:29:01.729
PATHWAYS WITHOUT BIOMASS USE.

03:29:01.795 --> 03:29:03.430
BUT YOU KNOW, AND THERE ARE

03:29:03.497 --> 03:29:05.132
METHODS OF CEDAR. IN FACT, WE

03:29:05.199 --> 03:29:08.102
HAVE THE 1757 PROCESS HAPPENING.

03:29:08.168 --> 03:29:11.505
NOW. WHAT WE ARE ASKING FOR IS

03:29:11.572 --> 03:29:13.540
THAT THERE BE SOME R&amp;D ON THESE

03:29:13.607 --> 03:29:14.675
NASCENT TECHNOLOGIES. MOST OF

03:29:14.742 --> 03:29:17.011
THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE NEW AND

03:29:17.077 --> 03:29:18.479
THEY HAVEN'T SHOWN THEIR

03:29:18.545 --> 03:29:20.014
EFFECTIVENESS. AND IN THE CASE

03:29:20.080 --> 03:29:20.981
OF BIOMASS, THERE IS LOTS OF

03:29:21.048 --> 03:29:22.850
DATA, FOR EXAMPLE, TO SHOW THAT

03:29:22.917 --> 03:29:24.752
GASIFICATION AND PYROLYSIS ARE

03:29:24.818 --> 03:29:25.819
JUST AS POLLUTING. BIOMASS

03:29:25.886 --> 03:29:27.821
ENERGY, BY THE WAY, IS THE MOST

03:29:27.888 --> 03:29:30.024
EXPENSIVE ENERGY IN THE STATE.

03:29:30.090 --> 03:29:31.959
WITH REGARD TO YOU, ASKED ABOUT

03:29:32.026 --> 03:29:34.695
THE GEOENGINEERING, WE ARE A BIG

03:29:34.762 --> 03:29:36.664
SUPPORTER OF THE NATURAL SYSTEM.

03:29:36.730 --> 03:29:38.599
YOU KNOW, RESTORING THE OCEAN

03:29:38.666 --> 03:29:40.567
ECOSYSTEMS, YOU KNOW, IN THAT

03:29:40.634 --> 03:29:41.168
PROCESS IS UNDERWAY. WE WOULD

03:29:41.235 --> 03:29:42.803
SAY THAT IN A TIME OF BUDGET

03:29:42.870 --> 03:29:44.138
CRISIS, WE SHOULD BE FULLY

03:29:44.204 --> 03:29:45.539
FUNDING THAT BEFORE. UNLESS

03:29:45.606 --> 03:29:47.274
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT R&amp;D,

03:29:47.341 --> 03:29:48.842
BECAUSE THESE OTHER THREE

03:29:48.909 --> 03:29:50.277
METHODS NEED RESEARCH AND

03:29:50.344 --> 03:29:51.679
DEVELOPMENT. BEFORE WE GO

03:29:51.745 --> 03:29:53.447
FURTHER, THERE IS A GREAT

03:29:53.514 --> 03:29:54.882
CONCERN BECAUSE THE

03:29:54.949 --> 03:29:55.582
GEOENGINEERING AT THE OCEAN

03:29:55.649 --> 03:29:58.619
WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE ON SUCH A

03:29:58.686 --> 03:29:59.853
LARGE SCALE TO MAKE A

03:29:59.920 --> 03:30:00.754
DIFFERENCE, THAT THERE IS GREAT

03:30:00.821 --> 03:30:01.488
CONCERN AMONG THE SCIENCE

03:30:01.555 --> 03:30:02.723
COMMUNITY FOR THE HARM THAT IT

03:30:02.790 --> 03:30:05.592
COULD DO. AND AS WE SAID WITH AN

03:30:05.659 --> 03:30:06.560
EARLIER BILL, THIS IS $1

03:30:06.627 --> 03:30:07.494
TRILLION COASTAL ECONOMY. OUR

03:30:07.561 --> 03:30:08.862
COASTAL COUNTIES THEMSELVES

03:30:08.929 --> 03:30:10.397
WOULD BE THE 12TH LARGEST

03:30:10.464 --> 03:30:11.832
ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. SO WE

03:30:11.899 --> 03:30:13.968
REALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT THE SORT

03:30:14.034 --> 03:30:15.402
OF DAMAGE THAT WE WOULD BE

03:30:15.469 --> 03:30:17.905
DOING. BUT AM I MISUNDERSTANDING

03:30:17.972 --> 03:30:19.840
THE BILL? I THOUGHT THE BILL IS

03:30:19.907 --> 03:30:21.775
TO INVEST IN THE RESEARCH AND

03:30:21.842 --> 03:30:22.476
DEVELOPMENT. IT'S A IT'S A

03:30:22.543 --> 03:30:24.445
MANDATE TO FUND A PROJECT FUND

03:30:24.511 --> 03:30:25.980
PROJECTS. WE REALLY SCAN TO SEE

03:30:26.046 --> 03:30:28.082
IF THERE WAS ANY R&amp;D BECAUSE

03:30:28.148 --> 03:30:29.450
WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO DOING R&amp;D

03:30:29.516 --> 03:30:31.652
ON THESE THINGS. SENATOR, WOULD

03:30:31.719 --> 03:30:34.021
YOU. WELL, I WOULD DISAGREE WITH

03:30:34.088 --> 03:30:38.192
THAT. THAT. ANALYSIS OF WHAT

03:30:38.258 --> 03:30:40.327
WE'RE WHAT WE'RE DOING, THE CARB

03:30:40.394 --> 03:30:43.230
IS, IS TO DO THE RESEARCH

03:30:43.297 --> 03:30:44.565
NECESSARY TO DETERMINE WHICH IS

03:30:44.631 --> 03:30:47.134
THE MOST EFFECTIVE, WHICH IS THE

03:30:47.201 --> 03:30:51.038
MOST COST EFFECTIVE. IN A WHOLE

03:30:51.105 --> 03:30:53.374
NUMBER OF, OF AREAS. THEY WOULD

03:30:53.440 --> 03:30:55.743
BE DETERMINING WHICH INVESTMENTS

03:30:55.809 --> 03:30:58.445
TO MAKE BASED ON ON DATA THAT

03:30:58.512 --> 03:31:00.347
THEY WOULD COLLECT. THEY'VE BEEN

03:31:00.414 --> 03:31:02.616
DOING THE STUDIES ON, ON ON

03:31:02.683 --> 03:31:04.284
THIS. THEIR SCOPING PLAN WAS

03:31:04.351 --> 03:31:10.524
FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT. SO IT'S NOT

03:31:10.591 --> 03:31:11.859
THEY'RE NOT PICKING SOMETHING

03:31:11.925 --> 03:31:13.360
OFF THE SHELF. AND JUST SAYING

03:31:13.427 --> 03:31:15.229
THIS SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA.

03:31:15.295 --> 03:31:17.064
THEY'RE GOING TO BE DOING THE

03:31:17.131 --> 03:31:18.465
RESEARCH AND LOOKING AT THE

03:31:18.532 --> 03:31:19.199
RESEARCH TO DETERMINE HOW TO

03:31:19.266 --> 03:31:22.369
MAKE THE, THE INVESTMENTS OF THE

03:31:22.436 --> 03:31:23.604
RESOURCES THAT THEY WILL HAVE.

03:31:23.670 --> 03:31:26.907
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER

03:31:26.974 --> 03:31:29.576
QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE

03:31:29.643 --> 03:31:31.779
MEMBERS? MR. CARVER? THANK YOU,

03:31:31.845 --> 03:31:33.847
MR. CHAIR. AND THANK YOU TO OUR

03:31:33.914 --> 03:31:36.417
COLLEAGUE FOR ASKING SOME OF THE

03:31:36.483 --> 03:31:38.519
SIMILAR QUESTIONS THAT I, THAT I

03:31:38.585 --> 03:31:40.087
HAD. I SHARE SOME OF THE

03:31:40.154 --> 03:31:41.388
CONCERNS WITH THE OPPOSITION,

03:31:41.455 --> 03:31:44.058
BUT I ALSO HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE

03:31:44.124 --> 03:31:45.692
TO TALK TO YOU AND DIVE A LITTLE

03:31:45.759 --> 03:31:47.694
BIT MORE INTO THIS BILL. I AM ON

03:31:47.761 --> 03:31:50.097
UND Ã, SO IT'LL GIVE ME AN

03:31:50.164 --> 03:31:51.432
OPPORTUNITY TO DO A LITTLE BIT

03:31:51.498 --> 03:31:52.800
MORE DIVING INTO IT. BUT I LIKE

03:31:52.866 --> 03:31:53.934
THE DIRECTION THIS CONVERSATION

03:31:54.001 --> 03:31:55.035
IS GOING, THAT THERE'S A

03:31:55.102 --> 03:31:57.604
RECOGNITION THAT WE DO NEED R&amp;D.

03:31:57.671 --> 03:31:58.839
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT ADVANCED

03:31:58.906 --> 03:32:01.542
KIND OF FUNDING IN KIND OF THAT

03:32:01.608 --> 03:32:03.844
INCENTIVIZATION IS WHAT LEADS TO

03:32:03.911 --> 03:32:05.879
BREAKTHROUGHS. AND THERE'S NO

03:32:05.946 --> 03:32:08.115
DOUBT, I THINK, THAT THAT THERE

03:32:08.182 --> 03:32:09.550
MAY BE ADVANTAGE ONCE WE CAN GET

03:32:09.616 --> 03:32:10.951
SOME OF THOSE BREAKTHROUGHS AND

03:32:11.018 --> 03:32:12.820
THAT EVERYONE, THE ENVIRONMENTAL

03:32:12.886 --> 03:32:14.755
COMMUNITY AND INDUSTRY, EVERYONE

03:32:14.822 --> 03:32:16.657
CAN COME TOGETHER AND SAY THIS

03:32:16.723 --> 03:32:19.059
IS A PATH THAT CAN ACTUALLY MAKE

03:32:19.126 --> 03:32:20.961
SENSE, REQUIRES, YOU KNOW, SOME

03:32:21.028 --> 03:32:23.630
INVESTMENT. THAT BEING SAID, I

03:32:23.697 --> 03:32:27.267
DO ALSO PREFER NATURE BASED

03:32:27.334 --> 03:32:29.336
SOLUTIONS. I THINK ULTIMATELY

03:32:29.403 --> 03:32:30.904
THAT'S WHERE, YOU KNOW, WE

03:32:30.971 --> 03:32:32.573
REALLY DO NEED TO PUT MUCH OF

03:32:32.639 --> 03:32:34.274
OUR INVESTMENT. BUT

03:32:34.341 --> 03:32:35.342
UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE

03:32:35.409 --> 03:32:36.910
CERTAIN INDUSTRIES THAT ARE

03:32:36.977 --> 03:32:40.013
CREATING CERTAIN KIND OF

03:32:40.080 --> 03:32:41.582
IN-STREAM PRODUCTS, THAT IF

03:32:41.648 --> 03:32:43.050
THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO

03:32:43.117 --> 03:32:44.785
SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T CREATE

03:32:44.852 --> 03:32:46.587
THOSE EMISSIONS AND DOESN'T

03:32:46.653 --> 03:32:49.523
CREATE OTHER NEFARIOUS SIDE

03:32:49.590 --> 03:32:51.959
EFFECTS, SO TO SPEAK, THAT THIS

03:32:52.025 --> 03:32:53.460
R&amp;D CAN HOPEFULLY HELP US GET

03:32:53.527 --> 03:32:55.229
THERE. SO MAYBE SOME MOVING

03:32:55.295 --> 03:32:56.797
FORWARD, SOME CLARIFICATION OF

03:32:56.864 --> 03:32:58.165
WHAT GRANTS ARE ELIGIBLE AND

03:32:58.232 --> 03:33:00.167
THAT IT COULD BE MORE ABOUT

03:33:00.234 --> 03:33:03.237
GETTING TO A PLACE WITH, YOU

03:33:03.303 --> 03:33:04.972
KNOW, FIGURING OUT WHICH NOT

03:33:05.038 --> 03:33:06.607
PICKING WINNERS OR LOSERS ON

03:33:06.673 --> 03:33:07.774
PROJECTS OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT

03:33:07.841 --> 03:33:09.276
AREN'T PROVEN, BUT RATHER QUITE

03:33:09.343 --> 03:33:12.179
THE OPPOSITE OF ACTUALLY TRYING

03:33:12.246 --> 03:33:14.014
TO DO THE RESEARCH AND ALLOW

03:33:14.081 --> 03:33:15.249
COMPANIES THAT ARE THESE CUTTING

03:33:15.315 --> 03:33:16.683
EDGE COMPANIES TO ACTUALLY SHOW

03:33:16.750 --> 03:33:17.951
THEIR WORK AND SAY, OKAY, THIS

03:33:18.018 --> 03:33:20.154
IS SOMETHING THAT COULD WORK,

03:33:20.220 --> 03:33:22.322
YOU KNOW, MOVING FORWARD, BUT

03:33:22.389 --> 03:33:23.857
I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR THIS

03:33:23.924 --> 03:33:26.393
TODAY. I'M GOING TO BE SEEING IT

03:33:26.460 --> 03:33:27.327
AGAIN AND LOOK FORWARD TO

03:33:27.394 --> 03:33:28.028
CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS WITH

03:33:28.095 --> 03:33:29.763
THE YOU AND YOUR SPONSORS AND

03:33:29.830 --> 03:33:30.697
THE OPPOSITION. THANK YOU VERY

03:33:30.764 --> 03:33:32.466
MUCH, I APPRECIATE THAT. CAN I

03:33:32.533 --> 03:33:34.801
JUST SAY THAT I AGREE WITH YOU

03:33:34.868 --> 03:33:35.536
100%. I THINK NATURE BASED

03:33:35.602 --> 03:33:37.037
SOLUTIONS ARE THE BEST, RIGHT?

03:33:37.104 --> 03:33:39.373
THE CHALLENGES THAT WE CAN'T GET

03:33:39.439 --> 03:33:42.042
TO THE NUMBERS WITH NATURE BASED

03:33:42.109 --> 03:33:43.744
SOLUTIONS ONLY NOT IN

03:33:43.810 --> 03:33:44.745
CALIFORNIA. AND WE'VE BEEN

03:33:44.811 --> 03:33:46.980
PUTTING UP RESOURCES, AND THOSE

03:33:47.047 --> 03:33:49.783
RESOURCES HAVE GONE TO FUND GOOD

03:33:49.850 --> 03:33:52.286
PROJECTS. BUT IN OTHER STATES.

03:33:52.352 --> 03:33:53.954
AND SO THE QUESTION IS, CAN WE

03:33:54.021 --> 03:33:56.423
DO STUFF IN THE STATE THAT THAT

03:33:56.490 --> 03:33:59.159
THAT GETS US TOWARDS OUR GOALS

03:33:59.226 --> 03:34:01.395
IN A WAY THAT WE CAN THAT'S

03:34:01.461 --> 03:34:04.898
MEASURABLE, THAT IS THAT THAT

03:34:04.965 --> 03:34:07.167
SHOWS SOME PROGRESS AND THAT

03:34:07.234 --> 03:34:08.535
TELLS US THE DIRECTION FOR THE

03:34:08.602 --> 03:34:12.039
FUTURE AS WELL. SO I APPRECIATE

03:34:12.105 --> 03:34:12.639

03:34:12.706 --> 03:34:15.142
