THE END OF THE HEARING, WHICH I

00:42:22.773 --> 00:42:23.307

SERIOUS CRIMINAL ACTIVITY.

00:44:30.401 --> 00:44:31.635
POWERLESS. THERE'S NO STATUTE

STATE COURT. SO IT'S REALLY

00:44:35.039 --> 00:44:37.341

NECESSARY. WE WANT TO REMIND

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:22.045

00:46:25.215 --> 00:46:27.017
ATTEMPTS TO FURTHER CRIMINALIZE.

00:46:27.084 --> 00:46:28.385
IT IS WELL DOCUMENTED THAT

00:46:28.452 --> 00:46:30.020
CALIFORNIA'S PENAL CODE HAS BEEN

00:46:30.087 --> 00:46:30.854
CRITICIZED FOR ITS COMPLEXITY

00:46:30.921 --> 00:46:32.289
AND ITS UNNECESSARY DUPLICATION

00:46:32.356 --> 00:46:34.591
OF EXISTING CRIMES. OVER THE

00:46:34.658 --> 00:46:35.626
LAST SEVERAL DECADES,

00:46:35.692 --> 00:46:37.094
CALIFORNIA'S CRIMINAL CODE HAS

00:46:37.161 --> 00:46:39.596
GROWN TO MORE THAN 5000 SEPARATE

00:46:39.663 --> 00:46:40.731

EVERY CONCEIVABLE FORM OF HUMAN

00:46:43.333 --> 00:46:45.302
MISBEHAVIOR. NOW IS NOT THE TIME

00:46:45.369 --> 00:46:46.837
FOR CALIFORNIA TO BE CREATING

00:46:46.904 --> 00:46:47.871
NEW WOBBLERS, PARTICULARLY WHEN

00:46:47.938 --> 00:46:49.806
DOING SO WILL NOT NOW HAVE A

00:46:49.873 --> 00:46:51.842
GREATER IMPACT ON PUBLIC SAFETY.

00:46:51.909 --> 00:46:52.843
FOR THESE REASONS, WE

00:47:20.437 --> 00:47:22.172
WE'D LIKE A LITTLE MORE TIME TO

LOOK AT IT, BUT WE EXPECT TO

00:47:24.608 --> 00:47:27.544
WITHDRAW OUR OPPOSITION. DAVID

00:47:27.611 --> 00:47:29.079

ALL RIGHT. WELL, THANK YOU ALL.

00:47:42.059 --> 00:47:43.060
SEEING NO ONE ELSE HOPING TO

00:47:43.126 --> 00:47:44.394
COMMENT ON THE MATTER.

00:47:44.461 --> 00:47:45.796
COLLEAGUES, WE DON'T YET HAVE A

00:47:45.862 --> 00:47:47.631
QUORUM SO WE WON'T BE ABLE TO

00:47:47.698 --> 00:47:49.132
ENTERTAIN A MOTION OR MOVE THE

00:47:49.199 --> 00:47:51.201
BILL AT THIS TIME, HOWEVER, WE

00:47:51.268 --> 00:47:52.035
CAN ENGAGE IN QUESTIONS FOR THE

00:47:52.102 --> 00:47:53.604
AUTHOR OR ANY OF OUR WITNESSES

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:55.405
AND OR ANY DEBATE AMONGST THE

00:47:55.472 --> 00:47:56.273

00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:58.976
EAGER TO JUMP IN. YEAH. JUST

00:47:59.042 --> 00:48:01.011
QUICKLY, I THINK THAT IT SHOULD

00:48:01.078 --> 00:48:04.715
BE UNDERSTOOD THAT STATE

00:48:04.781 --> 00:48:06.383
ENFORCERS CAN'T ENFORCE FEDERAL

00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:09.853
LAW. SO TO THE OPPOSITION'S

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:11.054
POINT, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT

00:48:11.121 --> 00:48:13.290
WE HAVE A STATUTE THAT ALLOWS

00:48:13.357 --> 00:48:14.925
OUR LOCAL ENFORCEMENT TO TAKE

00:48:14.992 --> 00:48:16.760
ACTION AND TO ENFORCE AGAINST

00:48:16.827 --> 00:48:19.263
THIS CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR. SO I'M

00:48:19.329 --> 00:48:21.331
THANKFUL FOR THIS. NOTICE THAT

00:48:21.398 --> 00:48:23.600
YOU'VE TAKEN AND I'D LIKE TO BE

00:48:23.667 --> 00:48:24.701

00:48:24.768 --> 00:48:27.404
OKAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY

00:48:27.471 --> 00:48:28.905

00:48:32.376 --> 00:48:36.246
TIME? OKAY, THEN, WITH THAT,

00:48:36.313 --> 00:48:37.681
SENATOR WAHAB, WOULD YOU LIKE TO

00:48:52.863 --> 00:48:53.830
TIME, I WANT TO THANK THE

00:48:53.897 --> 00:48:55.732
SENATOR FOR HER WORK ON THIS. I

00:48:55.799 --> 00:48:56.933
THINK THE AMENDMENTS

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:57.501
SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED. THE

00:48:57.567 --> 00:48:58.802
BILL. CHAIR IS RECOMMENDING AN

00:48:58.869 --> 00:49:00.671
AYE AND WILL KEEP THIS MATTER

00:49:00.737 --> 00:49:02.039
OPEN UNTIL WE HAVE A QUORUM.

00:49:02.105 --> 00:49:04.641
THANK YOU. SENATOR. ALL RIGHT.

00:49:04.708 --> 00:49:06.977
NEXT WE HAVE ITEM NUMBER 14.

00:49:07.044 --> 00:49:08.912
THIS IS BY SENATOR DURAZZO.

00:49:08.979 --> 00:49:11.548
COLLEAGUES, THIS IS SENATE BILL

00:49:11.615 --> 00:49:14.351
834. SENATOR, WHEN YOU'RE READY,

00:49:14.418 --> 00:49:15.886
YOU'LL HAVE FIVE MINUTES, AS

00:49:15.952 --> 00:49:22.159
WILL YOUR WITNESS. GOOD MORNING,

00:49:22.225 --> 00:49:24.227
MR. CHAIR. AND MEMBERS OF THE

00:49:24.294 --> 00:49:28.432
COMMITTEE. SB 834 IS A TECHNICAL

00:49:28.498 --> 00:49:31.068
FIX TO IMPROVE IMPLEMENTATION OF

00:49:31.134 --> 00:49:32.836
WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE IN

00:49:32.903 --> 00:49:34.237
CALIFORNIA ON OUR AUTOMATIC

00:49:34.304 --> 00:49:36.673
RECORD CLEARANCE LAWS THAT WERE

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:39.042
TWO IN PARTICULAR, AB 1076 AND

00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:42.145
SB 731. THIS BILL DOES NOT

00:49:42.212 --> 00:49:44.715
EXPAND ELIGIBILITY, HOWEVER, IT

00:49:44.781 --> 00:49:46.516
ENSURES THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:49:46.583 --> 00:49:48.952
ALREADY ELIGIBLE CAN ACCESS THE

00:49:49.019 --> 00:49:52.289
RELIEF. CURRENT LAW PROVIDES.

00:49:52.356 --> 00:49:53.557
UNDER THE PREVIOUS TWO BILLS

00:49:53.623 --> 00:49:55.092
THAT I MENTIONED, INDIVIDUALS

00:49:55.158 --> 00:49:56.860
ARE ELIGIBLE FOR AUTOMATIC

00:49:56.927 --> 00:49:59.129
RECORD CLEARANCE IF THEY MEET

00:49:59.196 --> 00:50:01.631
CERTAIN CRITERIA, INCLUDING NOT

00:50:01.698 --> 00:50:04.101
HAVING PENDING CHARGES. MANY

00:50:04.167 --> 00:50:06.937
ARRESTS ARE STILL LABELED AS

00:50:07.003 --> 00:50:09.873
PENDING IN DOJ RECORDS DUE TO

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:11.775
MISSING OR INCOMPLETE

00:50:11.842 --> 00:50:13.310
INFORMATION, SUCH AS CASES WHERE

00:50:13.377 --> 00:50:15.245
CHARGES WERE NEVER EVEN FILED,

00:50:15.312 --> 00:50:17.681
WERE DISMISSED IN COURT OR

00:50:17.748 --> 00:50:19.516
RESOLVED, BUT NEVER PROPERLY

00:50:19.583 --> 00:50:21.718
REPORTED. THESE OUTDATED PENDING

00:50:21.785 --> 00:50:23.453
CHARGES ARE WRONGLY BLOCKING

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:24.988
ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS FROM

00:50:25.055 --> 00:50:27.557
RECEIVING RELIEF, EVEN WHEN NO

00:50:27.624 --> 00:50:28.925
PROSECUTION EVER OCCURRED. WHEN

00:50:28.992 --> 00:50:30.794
RELIEF IS GRANTED, THE DOJ

00:50:30.861 --> 00:50:32.496
UPDATES THE PERSON'S STATE

00:50:32.562 --> 00:50:33.997
RECORD, BUT THERE IS NO

00:50:34.064 --> 00:50:35.966
REQUIREMENT FOR LOCAL COURTS TO

00:50:36.032 --> 00:50:37.267
DO THE SAME. AS A RESULT,

00:50:37.334 --> 00:50:39.469
BACKGROUND CHECKS THAT RELY ON

00:50:39.536 --> 00:50:42.139
LOCAL COURT DATA CAN SHOW OLD

00:50:42.205 --> 00:50:43.607
CONVICTIONS THAT WERE ALREADY

00:50:43.673 --> 00:50:45.542
CLEARED, LEADING TO CONFUSION

00:50:45.609 --> 00:50:47.677
AND HARM. PEOPLE MAY ALSO NEED

00:50:47.744 --> 00:50:48.979
TO PROVIDE DOCUMENTATION THAT

00:50:49.045 --> 00:50:50.580
THEIR RECORD HAS BEEN CLEARED,

00:50:50.647 --> 00:50:52.182
BUT THERE IS NO STANDARDIZED

00:50:52.249 --> 00:50:54.251
COURT CERTIFICATE AVAILABLE FOR

00:50:54.317 --> 00:50:56.153
THEM TO REQUEST. THESE GAPS ARE

00:50:56.219 --> 00:50:58.488
PREVENTING OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE

00:50:58.555 --> 00:50:59.856
INDIVIDUALS FROM FULLY

00:50:59.923 --> 00:51:01.291
BENEFITING FROM CALIFORNIA'S

00:51:01.358 --> 00:51:03.860
RECORD CLEARANCE LAWS. THIS BILL

00:51:03.927 --> 00:51:06.062
OFFERS PRACTICAL, TARGETED

00:51:06.129 --> 00:51:08.231
CHANGES TO ENSURE THE LAWS WE'VE

00:51:08.298 --> 00:51:09.966
ALREADY PASSED ACTUALLY

00:51:10.033 --> 00:51:11.168
FUNCTION. WITH ME TODAY, I HAVE

00:51:11.234 --> 00:51:13.904
ED LITTLE WITH CALIFORNIANS FOR

00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:15.705
SAFETY AND JUSTICE. THANK YOU,

00:51:15.772 --> 00:51:19.009
MR. CHAIR. GOOD MORNING, CHAIR

00:51:19.075 --> 00:51:21.144
AND MEMBERS. MY NAME IS ED

00:51:21.211 --> 00:51:22.979
LITTLE, GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS

00:51:23.046 --> 00:51:24.481
MANAGER WITH CALIFORNIANS FOR

00:51:24.548 --> 00:51:26.183
SAFETY AND JUSTICE AND PROUD

00:51:26.249 --> 00:51:28.685
SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. CALIFORNIA

00:51:28.752 --> 00:51:31.388
MADE HISTORIC PROGRESS WITH AB

00:51:31.455 --> 00:51:36.159
1076, CHAPTER 578 STATUS OF 2019

00:51:36.226 --> 00:51:41.298
AND SB 731, CHAPTER 814 STATUS

00:51:41.364 --> 00:51:43.767
2022 EXPANDING AUTOMATIC

00:51:43.834 --> 00:51:45.235
AUTOMATED RELIEF RECORD

00:51:45.302 --> 00:51:47.070
CLEARANCE FOR MILLIONS OF

00:51:47.137 --> 00:51:48.138
CALIFORNIANS WITH ELIGIBLE

00:51:48.205 --> 00:51:50.240
ARRESTS CONVICTIONS

00:51:50.307 --> 00:51:51.441
IMPLEMENTATION HAS REVEALED

00:51:51.508 --> 00:51:52.509
THREE CRITICAL BARRIERS

00:51:52.576 --> 00:51:54.511
PREVENTING SOME INDIVIDUALS FROM

00:51:54.578 --> 00:51:56.646
RECEIVING A OR FULLY BENEFITING

00:51:56.713 --> 00:51:59.249
FROM THIS RELIEF. SB 834

00:51:59.316 --> 00:52:01.451
ADDRESSES THREE ISSUES BY

00:52:01.518 --> 00:52:02.853
PREVENTING OUTDATED PENDING

00:52:02.919 --> 00:52:04.721
CHARGES FROM BLOCKING RECORD

00:52:04.788 --> 00:52:06.756
CLEARANCE, REQUIRING LOCAL COURT

00:52:06.823 --> 00:52:08.658
RECORDS TO BE UPDATED TO MATCH

00:52:08.725 --> 00:52:10.460
STATE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

00:52:10.527 --> 00:52:11.561
RECORDS, AND ESTABLISHING A

00:52:11.628 --> 00:52:13.663
CLEAR PROCESS FOR INDIVIDUALS TO

00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:16.233
OBTAIN WRITTEN PROOF OF RELIEF.

00:52:16.299 --> 00:52:17.601
THIS BILL WOULD ADDRESS A SET OF

00:52:17.667 --> 00:52:19.302
ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED

00:52:19.369 --> 00:52:21.605
THROUGH IMPLEMENTATION. PAIN

00:52:21.671 --> 00:52:24.941
POINTS FOR AB 1076 AND SB 731

00:52:25.008 --> 00:52:26.743
THAT REQUIRE SOME SMALL

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:28.144
ADJUSTMENTS. COURTS ARE BY AND

00:52:28.211 --> 00:52:29.813
LARGE, DOING THEIR PART TO

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:30.647
SHIELD RECORDS FROM PUBLIC VIEW

00:52:30.714 --> 00:52:33.016
WHEN THEY ARE IDENTIFIED BY DOJ

00:52:33.083 --> 00:52:35.519
AS SUBJECT TO THIS RELIEF.

00:52:35.585 --> 00:52:38.054
HOWEVER, CERTAIN ENTITIES RETAIN

00:52:38.121 --> 00:52:39.256
ACCESS TO CLEARED RECORDS

00:52:39.322 --> 00:52:41.024
THROUGH COURT AND LOCAL DATA

00:52:41.091 --> 00:52:43.560
SYSTEMS. PRIMARY LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:52:43.627 --> 00:52:44.995
AGENCIES A DESIGNATION THAT

00:52:45.061 --> 00:52:46.363
INDICATES PUBLIC DEFENDER'S

00:52:46.429 --> 00:52:47.931
OFFICES PROVIDING RECORD

00:52:47.998 --> 00:52:51.902
CLEARANCE AND LEGAL SERVICES

00:52:51.968 --> 00:52:53.169
WITHOUT A PROCESS TO RESOLVE

00:52:53.236 --> 00:52:54.638
OLD, INCOMPLETE, AND PENDING

00:52:54.704 --> 00:52:56.473
CHARGES, INDIVIDUALS REMAIN

00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:58.708
INELIGIBLE FOR RELIEF UNDER AB

00:52:58.775 --> 00:53:01.278
1076 AND SB 731, EVEN WHEN THE

00:53:01.344 --> 00:53:03.246
LEGAL SYSTEM ITSELF HAS

00:53:03.313 --> 00:53:05.148
ABANDONED THE CHARGE. YEARS AGO.

00:53:05.215 --> 00:53:06.917
AT THE SAME TIME, INDIVIDUALS

00:53:06.983 --> 00:53:09.185
WHO HAVE WHO DO RECEIVE RELIEF

00:53:09.252 --> 00:53:12.389
UNDER AB 1076 AND SB 700 31ST

00:53:12.455 --> 00:53:14.124
MAY HAVE NO RELIABLE WAY TO

00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:15.158
PROVE IT BECAUSE THE LOCAL

00:53:15.225 --> 00:53:17.427
RECORDS ARE OUTDATED AND THERE

00:53:17.494 --> 00:53:19.195
IS NO SIMPLE COURT ISSUED PROOF

00:53:19.262 --> 00:53:21.998
OF RELIEF AVAILABLE TO THEM UPON

00:53:22.065 --> 00:53:24.234
REQUEST. POTENTIAL FIXES AT THE

00:53:24.301 --> 00:53:25.835
COURT LEVEL INCLUDE. TO REQUIRE

00:53:25.902 --> 00:53:28.238
THE COURT TO PRODUCE, UPON

00:53:28.305 --> 00:53:29.639
REQUEST, WRITTEN CONFIRMATION

00:53:29.706 --> 00:53:31.408
THAT THEY HAVE RECEIVED

00:53:31.474 --> 00:53:32.809
NOTIFICATION OF RELIEF FROM THE

00:53:32.876 --> 00:53:36.012
DOJ FOR A PARTICULAR RECORD, AND

00:53:36.079 --> 00:53:37.480
ARE LIMITING ACCESS TO THE

00:53:37.547 --> 00:53:40.083
RECORD PURSUANT TO DOJ

00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:43.386
NOTIFICATION PER 1203 .425,

00:53:43.453 --> 00:53:45.088
ALLOWING PEOPLE TO EASILY OBTAIN

00:53:45.155 --> 00:53:46.890
RECORD SPECIFIC CONFIRMATION OF

00:53:46.957 --> 00:53:49.192
RELIEF IS IMPORTANT FOR EFFORTS

00:53:49.259 --> 00:53:51.628
TO BE CORRECT. THIS BILL WOULD

00:53:51.695 --> 00:53:53.029
SIMPLY MAKE MODEST TECHNICAL

00:53:53.096 --> 00:53:54.397
FIXES TO ALREADY ESTABLISHED

00:53:54.464 --> 00:53:56.333
LAW. FOR THESE REASONS, WE

00:53:56.399 --> 00:53:58.668

ANYONE HERE HOPING TO BE HEARD

00:54:43.913 --> 00:54:46.349
IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL.

00:54:46.416 --> 00:54:47.784
SEEING NONE. ANYONE ELSE WHO

00:54:47.851 --> 00:54:49.285
WANTS TO BE REGISTER AN OPINION

00:54:49.352 --> 00:54:51.755
OR VIEW ON THE BILL AT ALL?

00:54:51.821 --> 00:54:52.922
OKAY, THAT'S A GOOD START,

00:54:52.989 --> 00:54:55.458
SENATOR. NEXT WE'LL TURN IT BACK

RECOMMENDING AN AYE AT THE

APPROPRIATE TIME. AND, SENATOR,

00:55:11.675 --> 00:55:13.543
I WOULD JUST ADD, I THINK THIS

00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:14.911
IS A REALLY COMMON SENSE CLEANUP

00:55:14.978 --> 00:55:15.879
BILL. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ANY

00:55:15.945 --> 00:55:17.614
COAUTHORS, I'D BE HONORED TO

00:55:17.681 --> 00:55:19.382
JUMP ON BOARD AND HELP THAT ON

00:55:19.449 --> 00:55:22.052
OUR SIDE OF THE HOUSE. SO THANK

00:55:22.118 --> 00:55:22.819
YOU FOR YOUR TIME, AND WE'LL LET

00:55:22.886 --> 00:55:24.854
YOU KNOW HOW IT ALL TURNS OUT.

00:55:24.921 --> 00:55:25.755
OKAY. THANK YOU SENATOR. THANK

00:55:25.822 --> 00:55:28.158

JOINED US, AND SENATOR RUBIO IS

00:55:32.362 --> 00:55:37.467
NEXT IN SIGN IN ORDER. OKAY.

00:55:37.534 --> 00:55:39.602
SENATOR, WILL YOU BE TAKING ITEM

00:55:39.669 --> 00:55:41.071
THREE FIRST? THIS WOULD BE

00:55:41.137 --> 00:55:43.239
SENATE BILL 19. OR DO YOU WANT

00:55:43.306 --> 00:55:44.941
TO GO WITH IF YOU DON'T MIND,

00:55:45.008 --> 00:55:46.876
ONE OF MY WITNESSES NEEDS TO

00:55:46.943 --> 00:55:48.578
LEAVE. CAN WE START WITH SB 248.

00:55:48.645 --> 00:55:50.346
IS THAT OKAY? ABSOLUTELY. SO

00:55:50.413 --> 00:55:51.881
COLLEAGUES, WE'LL BE GOING TO

00:55:51.948 --> 00:55:53.349

BILL 248. SENATOR, YOU'LL HAVE

00:55:57.420 --> 00:55:58.254
FIVE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE

00:55:58.321 --> 00:56:00.457

00:56:01.624 --> 00:56:09.566
START UNTIL YOU BEGIN. THANK

00:56:09.632 --> 00:56:11.668
YOU. THANK YOU, CHAIR, AND

00:56:11.735 --> 00:56:12.836
MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE, IT'S

00:56:12.902 --> 00:56:15.338
AN HONOR TO PRESENT SB 248. THIS

00:56:15.405 --> 00:56:16.673
IS AN IMPORTANT BILL THAT WILL

00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:18.475
PROMOTE RESPONSIBLE GUN

00:56:18.541 --> 00:56:20.343
OWNERSHIP AND REDUCE GUN

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:23.146
VIOLENCE. FIRST AND FOREMOST, SB

00:56:23.213 --> 00:56:25.381
248 MAKES NO CHANGES TO FIREARM

00:56:25.448 --> 00:56:27.150
PURCHASES OR OWNERSHIP IN

00:56:27.217 --> 00:56:28.151
CALIFORNIA. I WANT TO MAKE THAT

00:56:28.218 --> 00:56:29.986
VERY CLEAR. OWNING A FIREARM

00:56:30.053 --> 00:56:32.255
COMES WITH SERIOUS

00:56:32.322 --> 00:56:33.223
RESPONSIBILITIES, AND THE RIGHT

00:56:33.289 --> 00:56:35.058
INFORMATION AT THE RIGHT TIME

00:56:35.125 --> 00:56:36.459
CAN SAVE LIVES. AND THAT'S THE

00:56:36.526 --> 00:56:37.961
GOAL. WHETHER IT'S PREVENTING A

00:56:38.027 --> 00:56:40.430
CHILD FROM ACCESSING A LOADED

00:56:40.497 --> 00:56:42.999
GUN OR MAKING SURE A DOMESTIC

00:56:43.066 --> 00:56:44.801
VIOLENCE SURVIVOR KNOWS THEIR

00:56:44.868 --> 00:56:48.071
LEGAL OPTIONS, EDUCATION IS KEY.

00:56:48.138 --> 00:56:50.874
REGARDLESS, SB 248 TAKES A VERY

00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:52.408
PROACTIVE APPROACH TO REDUCING

00:56:52.475 --> 00:56:53.743
GUN VIOLENCE BY ENSURING THAT

00:56:53.810 --> 00:56:55.845
NEW GUN OWNERS RECEIVE

00:56:55.912 --> 00:56:57.747
EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS ON

00:56:57.814 --> 00:56:59.949
RESPONSIBLE OWNERSHIP, SECURE

00:57:00.016 --> 00:57:01.384
STORAGE AND PREVENTING GUN

00:57:01.451 --> 00:57:03.319
RELATED TRAGEDIES. THIS BILL

00:57:03.386 --> 00:57:04.654
WILL REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA

00:57:04.721 --> 00:57:05.889
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO SEND A

00:57:05.955 --> 00:57:08.892

00:57:08.958 --> 00:57:10.293
THE ALREADY EXISTING TEN DAY

00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:12.562
WAITING PERIOD. THIS LETTER WILL

00:57:12.629 --> 00:57:14.631
INCLUDE IMPORTANT INFORMATION,

00:57:14.697 --> 00:57:16.866
BEST PRACTICES, HOW TO KEEP YOUR

00:57:16.933 --> 00:57:19.002

00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:24.007
AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES AND

00:57:24.073 --> 00:57:25.408
RESOURCES FOR GUN VIOLENCE

00:57:25.475 --> 00:57:28.044

BROAD COALITION OF ORGANIZATIONS

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.488

CAMPAIGN, MOMS DEMAND ACTION AND

00:57:42.826 --> 00:57:44.160
STUDENTS DEMAND ACTION AND

00:57:44.227 --> 00:57:46.396
EVERYTOWN FOR GUN SAFETY. PLEASE

00:57:46.462 --> 00:57:48.832
HELP ME WELCOME PENELOPE OLIVER,

00:57:48.898 --> 00:57:50.400
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND FOUNDER

00:57:50.466 --> 00:57:52.468
OF ALL ACCESS ARTS. REBECCA

00:57:52.535 --> 00:57:53.570
MARCUS, OUR REPRESENTING THE

00:57:53.636 --> 00:57:55.605
BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT GUN

00:57:55.672 --> 00:57:59.309
VIOLENCE. SO IF YOU CAN START,

00:57:59.375 --> 00:58:01.144
THANK YOU GUYS. AND THANK YOU. I

00:58:01.211 --> 00:58:02.912
WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR

00:58:02.979 --> 00:58:03.913
HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS BILL. MY

00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:06.115
NAME IS PENELOPE. I'M 18 YEARS

00:58:06.182 --> 00:58:07.684
OLD AND A YOUTH ACTIVIST. GOING

00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:09.752
INTO MY SECOND YEAR AT UC

00:58:09.819 --> 00:58:11.154
BERKELEY THROUGH MY NONPROFIT,

00:58:11.221 --> 00:58:13.022
ALL ACCESS ARTS. I ALSO WORK IN

00:58:13.089 --> 00:58:14.691
TRAUMA INFORMED YOUTH PROGRAMING

00:58:14.757 --> 00:58:16.226
FOR ARTS AND STEM FOR YOUTH IN

00:58:16.292 --> 00:58:18.261
CRISIS HERE IN SACRAMENTO.

00:58:18.328 --> 00:58:19.863
GROWING UP, BEFORE I WOULD HAVE

00:58:19.929 --> 00:58:20.897
A PLAY DATE, MY PARENTS WOULD

00:58:20.964 --> 00:58:22.799
ALWAYS ASK WHERE BEFORE I WENT

00:58:22.866 --> 00:58:24.200
OVER TO FRIENDS HOUSES, IF THEY

00:58:24.267 --> 00:58:25.869
HAD FIREARMS IN THE HOUSE AND IF

00:58:25.935 --> 00:58:27.704
THEY WERE SECURED SAFELY. MANY

00:58:27.770 --> 00:58:29.172
OF THEM WERE UPFRONT ABOUT

00:58:29.239 --> 00:58:31.374
HAVING FIREARMS AND HAVING THEM

00:58:31.441 --> 00:58:33.943
BE SECURED SAFELY BECAUSE THEY

00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:35.578
CAME FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:58:35.645 --> 00:58:36.746
BACKGROUNDS. HOWEVER, IF YOU

00:58:36.813 --> 00:58:38.248
LACK THIS BACKGROUND OR

00:58:38.314 --> 00:58:40.450
KNOWLEDGE THROUGHOUT, FOR

00:58:40.516 --> 00:58:42.185
INSTANCE, LAW ENFORCEMENT HAD

00:58:42.252 --> 00:58:43.253
BACKGROUNDS THROUGH LEADERSHIP

00:58:43.319 --> 00:58:45.388
AND TRAINING IN THEIR JOB, IT'S

00:58:45.455 --> 00:58:46.823
HARD TO FIND INFORMATION TO KNOW

00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:48.758
HOW TO SECURE YOUR FIREARMS

00:58:48.825 --> 00:58:50.460
SAFELY, AND IT ONLY TAKES A FEW

00:58:50.526 --> 00:58:51.961
SECONDS TO SAVE A LIFE AND SAVE

00:58:52.028 --> 00:58:53.596
THOSE AROUND YOU WHO COULD BE

00:58:53.663 --> 00:58:54.998
IMPACTED FROM A LIFETIME OF

00:58:55.064 --> 00:58:57.200
AGONY WORKING IN THE COMMUNITY.

00:58:57.267 --> 00:58:59.335
NOW, ALMOST EVERY CHILD I WORK

00:58:59.402 --> 00:59:00.837
WITH AND EVEN MY FRIENDS AT

00:59:00.904 --> 00:59:02.672
COLLEGE HAVE BEEN IMPACTED OR

00:59:02.739 --> 00:59:04.407
LOST SOMEONE TO GUN VIOLENCE.

00:59:04.474 --> 00:59:05.975
I'LL NEVER FORGET PLAYING SIMON

00:59:06.042 --> 00:59:07.810
SAYS AND HAVING A FIVE YEAR OLD

00:59:07.877 --> 00:59:09.812
LITTLE GIRL RAISE HER HANDS AND

00:59:09.879 --> 00:59:10.680
SAY, SIMON SAYS, RAISE YOUR

00:59:10.747 --> 00:59:12.115
HANDS LIKE YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE

00:59:12.181 --> 00:59:13.983
SHOT, AND LAY ON THE FLOOR LIKE

00:59:14.050 --> 00:59:15.818
YOU'VE BEEN HIT BY A BULLET. NOR

00:59:15.885 --> 00:59:17.687
WILL I EVER FORGET DRAWINGS THAT

00:59:17.754 --> 00:59:19.322
THEY HAVE. OF BLACK DOTS TO

00:59:19.389 --> 00:59:20.657
RESEMBLE BULLETS OF A PLAYGROUND

00:59:20.723 --> 00:59:22.325
IN SACRAMENTO. WHEN THE NUMBER

00:59:22.392 --> 00:59:24.227
ONE CAUSE OF DEATH FOR CHILDREN

00:59:24.294 --> 00:59:26.729
AND YOUTH IS GUN VIOLENCE, THESE

00:59:26.796 --> 00:59:28.598
UNPRECEDENTED TIMES CALL FOR

00:59:28.665 --> 00:59:29.966
UNPRECEDENTED AND LANDMARK

00:59:30.033 --> 00:59:31.067
LEGISLATIVE ACTION THAT OTHER

00:59:31.134 --> 00:59:33.503
STATES CAN FOLLOW. BEING A YOUNG

00:59:33.569 --> 00:59:34.938
PERSON WHO'S GROWN UP LEARNING

00:59:35.004 --> 00:59:36.339
HOW TO HIDE FROM A SHOOTER,

00:59:36.406 --> 00:59:37.840
BEFORE WE COULD EVEN LEARN HOW

00:59:37.907 --> 00:59:39.575
TO READ OR WRITE OR TIE OUR

00:59:39.642 --> 00:59:41.444
SHOES. WE DESERVE BETTER. WE

00:59:41.511 --> 00:59:43.880
DESERVE TO GROW UP. AND SO DO

00:59:43.947 --> 00:59:45.381
ALL CALIFORNIANS. WE DON'T HAVE

00:59:45.448 --> 00:59:46.816
TO LIVE OR DIE THIS WAY. AND

00:59:46.883 --> 00:59:48.651
IT'S CALIFORNIA'S RIGHT TO BEAR

00:59:48.718 --> 00:59:50.486
ARMS FOR SELF PROTECTION. AND

00:59:50.553 --> 00:59:51.754
IT'S A STATE AND LEGISLATORS

00:59:51.821 --> 00:59:53.957
DUTY TO ENSURE THEIR KNOWLEDGE

00:59:54.023 --> 00:59:55.491
OF SAFE STORAGE TO PROTECT ALL.

00:59:55.558 --> 00:59:56.993
THIS BILL WOULD ALSO AIM TO

00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:58.094
PROTECT CALIFORNIANS FROM ALL

00:59:58.161 --> 01:00:00.063
TYPES OF GUN VIOLENCE, INCLUDING

01:00:00.129 --> 01:00:01.965
HATE CRIMES, SUICIDES,

01:00:02.031 --> 01:00:03.700
ACCIDENTAL SHOOTINGS, DOMESTIC

01:00:03.766 --> 01:00:04.801
VIOLENCE, AND ESPECIALLY IN THIS

01:00:04.867 --> 01:00:07.203
DAY AND AGE, POLITICAL VIOLENCE.

01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:08.771
AT ITS CORE, THIS IS ABOUT

01:00:08.838 --> 01:00:10.106
FREEDOM TO BEAR ARMS

01:00:10.173 --> 01:00:11.975
RESPONSIBLY. WITH YOUR YES VOTE

01:00:12.041 --> 01:00:12.875
IN COMMITTEE, YOU CAN BE PART OF

01:00:12.942 --> 01:00:14.777
THE CHANGE AND SHOW YOUR

01:00:14.844 --> 01:00:16.012
COMMUNITY AND MY GENERATION THAT

01:00:16.079 --> 01:00:18.214
YOU CARE ABOUT OUR LIVES. YOU

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:19.749
HOLD THE POWER TO HONOR ALL

01:00:19.816 --> 01:00:22.418
VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE, OF GUN

01:00:22.485 --> 01:00:25.722
VIOLENCE WITH ACTION. THANK YOU.

01:00:25.788 --> 01:00:26.923
GOOD MORNING, CHAIR AND MEMBERS.

01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:28.658
MY NAME IS REBECCA MARCUS. I'M

01:00:28.725 --> 01:00:29.225
HERE REPRESENTING THE BRADY

01:00:29.292 --> 01:00:31.027
CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE

01:00:31.094 --> 01:00:33.363
IN SUPPORT OF AB 248. AS YOU ALL

01:00:33.429 --> 01:00:34.931
KNOW, GUN VIOLENCE IS A PUBLIC

01:00:34.998 --> 01:00:36.799
HEALTH EPIDEMIC THAT REQUIRES A

01:00:36.866 --> 01:00:38.034
MULTIFACETED APPROACH TO

01:00:38.101 --> 01:00:39.469
PREVENTION. MORE THAN ANY STATE.

01:00:39.535 --> 01:00:41.137
IN THE PAST TWO DECADES,

01:00:41.204 --> 01:00:42.205
CALIFORNIA HAS TAKEN STRONG

01:00:42.271 --> 01:00:43.706
ACTION TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE

01:00:43.773 --> 01:00:46.309
AND TO SAVE LIVES. SB 248 BUILDS

01:00:46.376 --> 01:00:47.944
ON THAT LEGACY, PROVIDING

01:00:48.011 --> 01:00:50.179
EDUCATION, INFORMATION AND TOOLS

01:00:50.246 --> 01:00:51.414
FOR THOSE BRINGING FIREARMS INTO

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:52.648
THEIR HOMES. SO OFTEN, PEOPLE

01:00:52.715 --> 01:00:54.183
BRING A GUN INTO THEIR HOME

01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:56.019
BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE IT WILL

01:00:56.085 --> 01:00:56.953
KEEP THEM SAFE AND THEIR

01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:58.021
FAMILIES SAFE. AND TO THAT END,

01:00:58.087 --> 01:01:00.156
IT IS SO IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO

01:01:00.223 --> 01:01:02.025
UNDERSTAND THE RISKS AND TO HOW

01:01:02.091 --> 01:01:03.026
TO REDUCE THEM, TO UNDERSTAND

01:01:03.092 --> 01:01:04.327
OUR COMPLEX SYSTEMS OF STATE AND

01:01:04.394 --> 01:01:05.795
FEDERAL LAWS, AND HOW TO COMPLY

01:01:05.862 --> 01:01:07.764
WITH THEM, AND HAVE INFORMATION

01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:08.965
FOR RESOURCES TO PREVENT GUN

01:01:09.032 --> 01:01:10.633
SUICIDE SHOULD THE NEED ARISE.

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:11.968
SIMILARLY, NEW RESIDENTS IN THE

01:01:12.035 --> 01:01:13.636
STATE NEED THIS INFORMATION TO

01:01:13.703 --> 01:01:15.204
UNDERSTAND OUR LAWS AND WHAT

01:01:15.271 --> 01:01:16.939
RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE. THIS

01:01:17.006 --> 01:01:18.708
BILL IS NOT AIMED AT

01:01:18.775 --> 01:01:19.609
DISINCENTIVIZING GUN OWNERSHIP.

01:01:19.675 --> 01:01:21.110
EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THAT

01:01:21.177 --> 01:01:22.912
FIREARMS ARE LETHAL WEAPONS.

01:01:22.979 --> 01:01:24.881
RATHER, IT PROVIDES INFORMATION

01:01:24.947 --> 01:01:26.516
THAT WILL PROVIDE UNINTENTIONAL

01:01:26.582 --> 01:01:27.984
SHOOTINGS WHERE CHILDREN DIE,

01:01:28.051 --> 01:01:29.685
GUN TRAFFICKING, GUN SUICIDE,

01:01:29.752 --> 01:01:31.521
AND IT WILL EMPOWER GUN OWNERS

01:01:31.587 --> 01:01:32.922
WITH RELEVANT EDUCATION AND

01:01:32.989 --> 01:01:35.224
TOOLS. THIS IS JUST COMMON

01:01:35.291 --> 01:01:37.326
SENSE. WE URGE YOUR AYE VOTE.

01:01:37.393 --> 01:01:38.895

SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL

OPPOSITION WITNESSES. DO WE HAVE

01:02:59.442 --> 01:03:03.613
ANY OPPOSITION WITNESSES TODAY?

01:03:03.679 --> 01:03:05.214
OKAY. I SEE ONE PERSON COMING

FORWARD, SO YOU'LL KNOW THE

01:03:06.582 --> 01:03:07.984
DRILL. ONCE YOU BEGIN SPEAKING.

01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:08.851
YOU'LL HAVE FIVE MINUTES TO

01:03:08.918 --> 01:03:10.586
ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE, SIR. OF

01:03:10.653 --> 01:03:13.055
COURSE, I DIDN'T PLAN ON DOING

01:03:13.122 --> 01:03:13.923
THIS, BUT I DID LISTEN TO THE

01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:14.924
PRIOR TESTIMONY, THE TESTIMONY

01:03:14.991 --> 01:03:15.992
FROM THE OTHER COMMITTEE

01:03:16.058 --> 01:03:17.860
HEARINGS ON THIS, WHAT WAS

01:03:17.927 --> 01:03:19.128
STATED SO THAT YOU UNDERSTAND

01:03:19.195 --> 01:03:20.429
THAT THIS INFORMATION THAT IS

01:03:20.496 --> 01:03:21.664
BEING PROVIDED IS ALREADY

01:03:21.731 --> 01:03:22.999
PROVIDED AT EVERY GUN STORE IN

01:03:23.065 --> 01:03:24.800

01:03:24.867 --> 01:03:26.369

HAS ALL THIS INFORMATION IN THE

01:03:34.343 --> 01:03:36.179
MANUAL. MY NAME IS DAVID. I

01:03:36.245 --> 01:03:37.413
APOLOGIZE FOR NOT MENTIONING

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:40.016
THAT BEFOREHAND AND I AM

01:03:40.082 --> 01:03:41.517
REPRESENTING CALIFORNIANS TIRED

01:03:41.584 --> 01:03:42.919
OF THIS LOW GRADE CONTINUOUS

01:03:42.985 --> 01:03:45.788
FINANCIAL ATTACK ON GUN OWNERS.

01:03:45.855 --> 01:03:47.590
WE ARE IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU.

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:49.859
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY,

01:03:49.926 --> 01:03:50.726
SIR. ANYONE ELSE HOPING TO BE

HEARD ON THE MATTER? OKAY.

01:03:53.162 --> 01:03:54.063
SEEING NO AFFIRMATIVE RESPONSE

01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:55.364
WILL TURN IT BACK TO THE

01:03:55.431 --> 01:03:56.332
COMMITTEE. ARE THERE ANY

01:03:56.399 --> 01:03:57.466
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS? SOME

01:03:57.533 --> 01:03:59.101
MEMBER. YOU LOOK EAGER TO ASK A

01:03:59.168 --> 01:04:00.736
QUESTION. I JUST WANT TO THANK

01:04:00.803 --> 01:04:01.871
THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THE

01:04:01.938 --> 01:04:03.906
BILL. I'LL MOVE IT. THANK YOU.

01:04:03.973 --> 01:04:05.408
OKAY. WE HAVE A MOTION. IS THERE

01:04:05.474 --> 01:04:07.109
A SECOND? WE HAVE A SECOND.

01:04:07.176 --> 01:04:07.944
WE'LL CONTINUE WITH DISCUSSION.

01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:10.246
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS?

01:04:10.313 --> 01:04:11.614
SEEING NONE. SENATOR RUBIO,

01:04:11.681 --> 01:04:13.516
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE? YES.

01:04:13.583 --> 01:04:16.018
THANK YOU. JUST ONE THING I JUST

01:04:16.085 --> 01:04:17.220
WANT TO SAY EDUCATION IS KEY.

01:04:17.286 --> 01:04:19.388
AND WHEN IT COMES TO SAVING

01:04:19.455 --> 01:04:21.857
LIVES, PEOPLE MAY CHOOSE NOT TO

01:04:21.924 --> 01:04:22.725
READ THE INFORMATION, BUT I

01:04:22.792 --> 01:04:24.627
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE PUT

01:04:24.694 --> 01:04:25.962
IT AT THEIR FINGERTIPS TO READ.

01:04:26.028 --> 01:04:27.897
AND WITH THAT, I ASK FOR YOUR

01:04:27.964 --> 01:04:28.798
VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY

01:04:28.864 --> 01:04:30.933
MUCH, SENATOR. COLLEAGUES, I

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.001
WILL BE RECOMMENDING AN AYE. I

01:04:32.068 --> 01:04:34.370
JUST WANT TO NOTE, I, I

01:04:34.437 --> 01:04:35.171
APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITION

01:04:35.238 --> 01:04:36.973
TESTIMONY. I DID READ THE

01:04:37.039 --> 01:04:38.407
LETTER. I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN

01:04:38.474 --> 01:04:39.842
ABOUT ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES,

01:04:39.909 --> 01:04:41.711
BUT I AGREE WITH OUR WITNESSES

01:04:41.777 --> 01:04:43.479
TODAY. I THINK EDUCATION IS KEY.

01:04:43.546 --> 01:04:45.014
THIS SEEMS LIKE A COMMON SENSE

01:04:45.081 --> 01:04:46.282
STRAIGHTFORWARD MEASURE. AND

01:04:46.349 --> 01:04:47.783
SENATOR, SHOULD IT PASS OUT OF

01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:48.851
COMMITTEE AND YOU'RE LOOKING FOR

01:04:48.918 --> 01:04:50.686
A COAUTHOR IN OUR HOUSE, I'D BE

01:04:50.753 --> 01:04:52.855
HAPPY TO JUMP ON BOARD AND HELP

01:04:52.922 --> 01:04:53.656
OUT. THANK YOU. WITH THAT, WE

01:04:53.723 --> 01:04:55.424
HAVE THE MOTION. AND SECOND,

01:04:55.491 --> 01:04:57.093
LET'S CALL THE ROLL FOR ITEM

01:04:57.159 --> 01:04:58.160
NUMBER FOUR, SB 248 BY SENATOR

01:04:58.227 --> 01:05:00.096
RUBIO. THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED

01:05:00.162 --> 01:05:01.163
TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE.

01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:04.667
SCHULTZ. SCHULTZ I ALANIS

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:07.436
GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ I. HANEY.

01:05:07.503 --> 01:05:10.172
BARBADIAN A BARBADIAN I LACKEY A

01:05:10.239 --> 01:05:13.009
VOTING LACKEY. NOT VOTING GWEN

01:05:13.075 --> 01:05:15.845
RAMOS. SHARPE. COLLINS. SHARPE.

01:05:15.911 --> 01:05:17.747
COLLINS I SO THAT MEASURE WILL

01:05:17.813 --> 01:05:18.948
REMAIN ON CALL. YOU'LL NEED ONE

01:05:19.015 --> 01:05:20.716
MORE VOTE. WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

01:05:20.783 --> 01:05:21.884
THE OUTCOME. ALTHOUGH MAYBE

01:05:21.951 --> 01:05:23.419
SOMEONE WILL WALK THROUGH THE

01:05:23.486 --> 01:05:25.087
DOOR AND WE'LL KNOW SOON. THANK

01:05:25.154 --> 01:05:25.721
YOU VERY MUCH, SENATOR. WE'LL

01:05:25.788 --> 01:05:27.189
GIVE YOU A MOMENT TO GET READY

01:05:27.256 --> 01:05:28.858
FOR THE NEXT ONE. COLLEAGUES,

01:05:28.924 --> 01:05:30.559
THE NEXT ITEM WILL BE TAKING UP

01:05:30.626 --> 01:05:32.361
IS ITEM NUMBER THREE, ALSO BY

01:05:32.428 --> 01:05:33.596
SENATOR RUBIO. THIS IS SENATE

01:05:33.663 --> 01:05:48.577
BILL 19.

01:05:48.644 --> 01:05:51.681
GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING. GOOD

01:05:51.747 --> 01:05:54.283
TO HAVE YOU HERE. LET ME KNOW

01:05:54.350 --> 01:05:56.085
WHEN YOU'RE READY. OKAY. WELL

01:05:56.152 --> 01:05:57.920
ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU, CHAIR. AND

01:05:57.987 --> 01:05:59.221
MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE, I'M

01:05:59.288 --> 01:06:01.791
PROUD TO PRESENT SB 19, THE SAFE

01:06:01.857 --> 01:06:04.060
SCHOOLS AND PLACES OF WORSHIP

01:06:04.126 --> 01:06:05.995
ACT AS A TEACHER FOR NEARLY 20

01:06:06.062 --> 01:06:08.731
YEARS IN CLASSROOM. I KNOW HOW

01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:10.499
THREATS AGAINST SCHOOLS CAN

01:06:10.566 --> 01:06:11.901
DISRUPT THE LEARNING OF OUR

01:06:11.967 --> 01:06:14.170
STUDENTS. THAT ALONE IS VERY

01:06:14.236 --> 01:06:15.938
TRAUMATIZING TO OUR STUDENTS AND

01:06:16.005 --> 01:06:17.640
TEACHERS. AND I REALLY HAVE AN

01:06:17.707 --> 01:06:20.109
ENTIRE COMMUNITY IN A STATE OF

01:06:20.176 --> 01:06:21.777
PANIC. EVERY TIME WE HEAR ABOUT

01:06:21.844 --> 01:06:23.546
THREATS, WE HAVE TO LOCK DOWN.

01:06:23.612 --> 01:06:25.614
IT IS NOT ONLY DISRUPTIVE TO THE

01:06:25.681 --> 01:06:26.949
LEARNING, BUT IT DOES HAVE A

01:06:27.016 --> 01:06:28.884
LASTING EFFECT ON OUR STUDENTS,

01:06:28.951 --> 01:06:29.985
ESPECIALLY WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING

01:06:30.052 --> 01:06:31.954
ACROSS OUR NATION. NO PARENT

01:06:32.021 --> 01:06:33.723
SHOULD EVER HAVE TO WONDER IF

01:06:33.789 --> 01:06:35.191
THEIR CHILD IS SAFE AT SCHOOL.

01:06:35.257 --> 01:06:36.892
NO FAMILY SHOULD SECOND GUESS.

01:06:36.959 --> 01:06:39.428
VISITING A PLACE OF WORSHIP. YOU

01:06:39.495 --> 01:06:41.797
KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN. SO TODAY,

01:06:41.864 --> 01:06:43.232
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL THAT

01:06:43.299 --> 01:06:45.101
WILL HELP CLOSE THE LOOPHOLE.

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:46.402
RIGHT NOW IN THE STATE OF

01:06:46.469 --> 01:06:48.304
CALIFORNIA, THE CALIFORNIA LAW

01:06:48.371 --> 01:06:50.172
FALLS SHORT IN PROTECTING OUR

01:06:50.239 --> 01:06:51.574
SCHOOLS AND OUR PLACES OF

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.876
WORSHIP FROM CRIMINAL THREATS.

01:06:53.943 --> 01:06:56.011
SB 19 IS CRITICAL. IT'S VERY

01:06:56.078 --> 01:06:58.614
CRITICAL TO PROTECT SCHOOLS. IT

01:06:58.681 --> 01:07:00.549
SIMPLY SAYS EXISTING LAW RIGHT

01:07:00.616 --> 01:07:03.919
NOW DOESN'T REALLY COME AFTER

01:07:03.986 --> 01:07:05.254
PEOPLE WHEN THEY MAKE CREDIBLE

01:07:05.321 --> 01:07:06.789
THREATS. IF THEY DIDN'T MENTION

01:07:06.856 --> 01:07:08.958
A PERSON IN THEIR THREAT. BUT

01:07:09.024 --> 01:07:10.593
THE DANGEROUS LOOPHOLE IS THE

01:07:10.659 --> 01:07:12.828
LAW RIGHT NOW. AND WE WANT TO

01:07:12.895 --> 01:07:14.563
MAKE SURE THAT WE CLARIFY THAT

01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:16.932
MAKING THREATS IS SOMETHING THAT

01:07:16.999 --> 01:07:19.034
WE TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY WITHOUT

01:07:19.101 --> 01:07:21.003
THAT DIRECT AND SPECIFIC THREAT,

01:07:21.070 --> 01:07:22.872
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS HAVE

01:07:22.938 --> 01:07:24.774
LIMITED OPTIONS EVEN WHEN IT

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:26.842
COMES TO ISSUES, WHEN THEY'RE

01:07:26.909 --> 01:07:29.378
VERY CLEARLY DANGEROUS TO OUR

01:07:29.445 --> 01:07:32.348
COMMUNITY. THIS BILL SIMPLY

01:07:32.415 --> 01:07:34.850
SPEAKS TO THOSE MAKING THREATS

01:07:34.917 --> 01:07:36.719
WHEN THEY, FOR EXAMPLE, IN SAN

01:07:36.786 --> 01:07:37.686
DIEGO RECENTLY, THERE WAS A

01:07:37.753 --> 01:07:38.954
THREAT WHERE A SCHOOL WAS

01:07:39.021 --> 01:07:40.556
MENTIONED, THE ADDRESS WAS

01:07:40.623 --> 01:07:41.857
GIVEN. THIS PERSON SAID THAT

01:07:41.924 --> 01:07:43.893
THEY WERE GOING TO GO KILL A LOT

01:07:43.959 --> 01:07:45.261
OF PEOPLE. AND BECAUSE ONCE

01:07:45.327 --> 01:07:46.762
AGAIN, IT DIDN'T SPECIFICALLY

01:07:46.829 --> 01:07:48.898
NAME A PERSON, IT FELL SHORT IN

01:07:48.964 --> 01:07:50.699
TERMS OF PROSECUTING THIS

01:07:50.766 --> 01:07:52.768
INDIVIDUAL. AND LATER ON, THIS

01:07:52.835 --> 01:07:54.303
PERSON WAS APPREHENDED ONCE

01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:56.238
AGAIN. AND THIS PERSON DID HAVE

01:07:56.305 --> 01:07:57.840
GUNS. THEY DID HAVE A SCHOOL

01:07:57.907 --> 01:07:59.041
MAP. SO THAT COULD HAVE

01:07:59.108 --> 01:08:00.409
POTENTIALLY TURNED OUT VERY

01:08:00.476 --> 01:08:02.077
DEADLY. BUT JUST LETTING THAT

01:08:02.144 --> 01:08:04.013
PERSON GO AND NOT TACKLING THAT

01:08:04.079 --> 01:08:06.115
ISSUE RIGHT AWAY LEFT OUR

01:08:06.182 --> 01:08:07.349
SCHOOLS EXPOSED. SO AGAIN, WE

01:08:07.416 --> 01:08:09.518
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CLOSE

01:08:09.585 --> 01:08:10.719
THAT LOOPHOLE. THERE'S A LOT OF

01:08:10.786 --> 01:08:11.954
HYPOTHETICALS, BUT THERE'S ALSO

01:08:12.021 --> 01:08:13.989
A LOT OF REAL CREDIBLE THREATS.

01:08:14.056 --> 01:08:15.891
THE AVERAGE COST FOR EVERY

01:08:15.958 --> 01:08:18.694
INCIDENT IS $100,000. I CAN TELL

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:19.829
YOU THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE

01:08:19.895 --> 01:08:21.497
STRUGGLING WITH RESOURCES. OUR

01:08:21.564 --> 01:08:23.165
SCHOOLS, OUR SCHOOL COMMUNITY,

01:08:23.232 --> 01:08:24.667
THEY'RE STRUGGLING WITH

01:08:24.733 --> 01:08:25.968
RESOURCES. AND THAT 100,000 CAN

01:08:26.035 --> 01:08:28.471
GO TO A BETTER TO BETTER SERVE

01:08:28.537 --> 01:08:30.539
OUR STUDENTS AND EDUCATION, OUR

01:08:30.606 --> 01:08:32.208
SENIORS AND OUR COMMUNITIES. SO

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:34.310
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:08:34.376 --> 01:08:35.945
TAKE CARE OF OUR COMMUNITY BY

01:08:36.011 --> 01:08:37.780
LETTING THEM KNOW THAT WE WILL

01:08:37.847 --> 01:08:39.915
NOT TOLERATE THREATS TO SCHOOLS

01:08:39.982 --> 01:08:42.117
OR PLACES OF WORSHIP. SCHOOLS

01:08:42.184 --> 01:08:43.519
AND PLACES OF WORSHIP HAVE BOTH

01:08:43.586 --> 01:08:45.120
SEEN A MASSIVE RISE IN THREATS

01:08:45.187 --> 01:08:46.755
MADE AGAINST THEM IN RECENT

01:08:46.822 --> 01:08:49.725
YEARS. SWATTING CALLS ARE COMMON

01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:51.427
OCCURRENCES. LOCKDOWNS ARE

01:08:51.494 --> 01:08:52.995
BECOMING AS COMMON OCCURRENCES,

01:08:53.062 --> 01:08:55.164
AND I THINK WE ALREADY PLACED SO

01:08:55.231 --> 01:08:56.499
MUCH ON OUR STUDENTS TO TRY TO

01:08:56.565 --> 01:08:58.000
DEFEND THEMSELVES IF AN INTRUDER

01:08:58.067 --> 01:08:59.902
COMES IN WITH A GUN. AND SO

01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:01.070
AGAIN, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:03.239
OUR PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES HAVE

01:09:03.305 --> 01:09:06.175
THE AUTHORITY TO QUESTION THESE

01:09:06.242 --> 01:09:07.343
INDIVIDUALS AND MAKING SURE THAT

01:09:07.409 --> 01:09:08.911
IF THERE ARE CREDIBLE THREATS,

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:10.813
THAT THEY DO HAVE CONSEQUENCES.

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:12.581
I THINK THAT'S THE MOST

01:09:12.648 --> 01:09:13.782
IMPORTANT THING WE CAN DO, IS

01:09:13.849 --> 01:09:15.784
MAKE SURE THAT WE TELL EVERYONE

01:09:15.851 --> 01:09:16.952
THAT WE WILL NOT TOLERATE THE

01:09:17.019 --> 01:09:18.487
WASTE OF OUR RESOURCES, HAVING

01:09:18.554 --> 01:09:19.288
OUR COMMUNITIES IN A STATE OF

01:09:19.355 --> 01:09:20.956
PANIC AND CONTINUING TO CAUSE

01:09:21.023 --> 01:09:23.359
FEAR. SO WITH ME TODAY, I HAVE

01:09:23.425 --> 01:09:24.193
TWO INDIVIDUALS THAT WILL SPEAK

01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:27.029
ON THIS ISSUE. I HAVE GARRETT

01:09:27.096 --> 01:09:28.464
HAMILTON, ASSISTANT CHIEF DEPUTY

01:09:28.531 --> 01:09:29.732
DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR THE YOLO

01:09:29.798 --> 01:09:31.433
COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:33.269
OFFICE. I HAVE CLIFF BURKE,

01:09:33.335 --> 01:09:34.403
REPRESENTING THE JEWISH PUBLIC

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:38.240
AFFAIRS COMMITTEE OF CALIFORNIA,

01:09:38.307 --> 01:09:39.942
JPAC, AND I WILL TURN IT OVER TO

01:09:40.009 --> 01:09:42.645
MY SPEAKERS. GOOD MORNING.

01:09:42.711 --> 01:09:45.180
SENATOR RUBIO HAS DONE A PERFECT

01:09:45.247 --> 01:09:47.049
JOB OF EXPLAINING THE PROBLEM.

01:09:47.116 --> 01:09:49.051
THE VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT

01:09:49.118 --> 01:09:52.821
THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO FIX.

01:09:52.888 --> 01:09:55.324
CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA, WE HAVE

01:09:55.391 --> 01:09:56.559
TO CHARGE CRIMINAL THREATS. YOU

01:09:56.625 --> 01:09:57.760
ESSENTIALLY HAVE TO HAVE AN

01:09:57.826 --> 01:10:00.296
IDENTIFIED VICTIM WHO IS IN

01:10:00.362 --> 01:10:01.864
SUSTAINED FEAR, AND THAT THREAT

01:10:01.931 --> 01:10:04.300
HAS TO GET TO THAT PERSON. NOW,

01:10:04.366 --> 01:10:06.435
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A VERY SERIOUS

01:10:06.502 --> 01:10:07.336
CRIME, AND IT HAPPENS

01:10:07.403 --> 01:10:11.006
FREQUENTLY, BUT YOU COULD MAKE A

01:10:11.073 --> 01:10:12.441
COMPELLING ARGUMENT THAT

01:10:12.508 --> 01:10:14.577
THREATENING AN ENTIRE SCHOOL OR

01:10:14.643 --> 01:10:17.379
HOUSE OF WORSHIP OR, YOU KNOW,

01:10:17.446 --> 01:10:20.015
SPORTING VENUE IS ACTUALLY A LOT

01:10:20.082 --> 01:10:22.985
WORSE IN TERMS OF THE PUBLIC

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:24.453
SAFETY AND THE FEAR. I THINK

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:26.555
ABOUT SCHOOLS EVACUATING, GOING

01:10:26.622 --> 01:10:28.824
THROUGH TRAININGS TO EVACUATE.

01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:30.059
YOU KNOW, WHY DO THIRD GRADERS

01:10:30.125 --> 01:10:32.127
HAVE TO KNOW THAT THERE'S PEOPLE

01:10:32.194 --> 01:10:33.829
THAT ARE WILLING TO THREATEN TO

01:10:33.896 --> 01:10:35.698
BLOW UP OR SHOOT SCHOOLS? IT'S

01:10:35.764 --> 01:10:38.834
REALLY, REALLY SERIOUS. SO IT'S

01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:42.104
A GREAT BILL. WE REALLY HOPE

01:10:42.171 --> 01:10:45.207
THAT IT PASSES AND BECOMES LAW.

01:10:45.274 --> 01:10:46.675
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. CLIFF

01:10:46.742 --> 01:10:48.210
BURKE HERE ON BEHALF OF THE

01:10:48.277 --> 01:10:49.111

PLACES OF WORSHIP ACT. THIS BILL

01:11:02.891 --> 01:11:04.693
WOULD STRENGTHEN CALIFORNIA'S

RESPONSE TO THREATS OF VIOLENCE

01:11:06.495 --> 01:11:07.930

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:13.435
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER A SPECIFIC

CRIMINAL THREATS STATUTE IS

01:16:20.909 --> 01:16:22.544
INSUFFICIENT, GENERAL THREATS TO

01:16:22.611 --> 01:16:23.979
PEOPLE AT A SCHOOL OR PLACE OF

01:16:24.046 --> 01:16:26.548
WORSHIP ARE REGULARLY PROSECUTED

01:16:26.615 --> 01:16:28.483
UNDER CURRENT LAW, AND COURTS

01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:30.919
HAVE UPHELD BOTH CONVICTIONS AND

01:16:30.986 --> 01:16:33.655
JUVENILE ADJUDICATIONS. WE NEED

01:16:33.722 --> 01:16:35.223
TO COMBAT THIS TRUMPIAN

01:16:35.290 --> 01:16:36.425
NARRATIVE OF AN AMERICA WHERE

01:16:36.491 --> 01:16:39.127
WE'RE ALL AFRAID OF EACH OTHER.

01:16:39.194 --> 01:16:40.996
WE ARE LIVING IN EXTREMELY

01:16:41.063 --> 01:16:42.764
DIFFICULT POLITICAL TIMES, AND

01:16:42.831 --> 01:16:44.032
THERE IS A TEMPTATION THAT IS

01:16:44.099 --> 01:16:46.168
VERY STRONG TO COVER EACH OTHER

01:16:46.234 --> 01:16:47.736
AND TO RESPOND WITH REACTIONARY

01:16:47.803 --> 01:16:50.005
FEAR. CALIFORNIA MUST REFUSE TO

01:16:50.072 --> 01:16:51.239
CAVE TO THESE FALSE NARRATIVES

01:16:51.306 --> 01:16:53.575
THAT PROMOTE FEAR, DISDAIN,

01:16:53.642 --> 01:16:55.711
DIVERSITY, AND WANT TO TAKE US

01:16:55.777 --> 01:16:59.548
BACKWARDS. THE LAW ALREADY

01:16:59.614 --> 01:17:01.516
COVERS SERIOUS THREATS TO SCHOOL

01:17:01.583 --> 01:17:03.485
SAFETY, AND THEY ARE WELL

01:17:03.552 --> 01:17:05.320
COVERED, BALLOONING UP OUR PENAL

01:17:05.387 --> 01:17:07.556
CODE IN THIS WAY JUST GIVES

01:17:07.622 --> 01:17:09.591
FODDER FOR OVERREACTIONS BASED

01:17:09.658 --> 01:17:12.027
IN FEAR THAT WILL CATCH UP. KIDS

01:17:12.094 --> 01:17:13.962
AND YOUNG PEOPLE IN OUR CRIMINAL

01:17:14.029 --> 01:17:16.231
LEGAL SYSTEM. PENAL CODE

01:17:16.298 --> 01:17:17.899
SECTIONS ARE NOT A QUICK FIX FOR

01:17:17.966 --> 01:17:20.469
SCHOOL SAFETY, AND I KNOW THIS

01:17:20.535 --> 01:17:21.636
AS BOTH AN ATTORNEY AND AS A

01:17:21.703 --> 01:17:25.207
PARENT. I HAVE REPRESENTED BOTH

01:17:25.273 --> 01:17:27.275
HORRIFIED PARENTS AND CONFUSED

01:17:27.342 --> 01:17:28.777
KIDS. AFTER PRINCIPALS HAVE

01:17:28.844 --> 01:17:30.278
CALLED LAW ENFORCEMENT TO

01:17:30.345 --> 01:17:31.413
INTERROGATE CHILDREN AS YOUNG AS

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:32.948
EIGHT YEARS OLD ON THE

01:17:33.015 --> 01:17:35.183
PLAYGROUND, THAT WHO MADE A

01:17:35.250 --> 01:17:35.917
STATEMENT THAT AN ADULT

01:17:35.984 --> 01:17:38.420
INTERPRETED AS THREATENING. AS A

01:17:38.487 --> 01:17:40.689
PARENT, I WAS ALSO HORRIFIED TO

01:17:40.756 --> 01:17:41.957
LEARN THAT MY CHILD'S PRINCIPAL

01:17:42.024 --> 01:17:43.625
HAD CALLED LAW ENFORCEMENT TO

01:17:43.692 --> 01:17:45.260
QUESTION MY SON'S FOURTH GRADE

01:17:45.327 --> 01:17:46.762
CLASSMATE FOR REGARDING A

01:17:46.828 --> 01:17:48.196
STATEMENT THAT HE MADE ON THE

01:17:48.263 --> 01:17:50.065
PLAYGROUND DURING RECESS. WE

01:17:50.132 --> 01:17:52.267
KNOW WHAT MAKES SCHOOLS SAFER.

01:17:52.334 --> 01:17:54.002
IT IS COMMUNITY. IT IS MENTAL

01:17:54.069 --> 01:17:56.038
HEALTH RESOURCES, AND IT IS

01:17:56.104 --> 01:17:57.272
SUPPORT FOR THOSE WHO ARE

01:17:57.339 --> 01:18:00.542
STRUGGLING. WE APPRECIATE THE

01:18:00.609 --> 01:18:02.944
AMENDMENTS ON THE BILL. WE ALSO

01:18:03.011 --> 01:18:04.079
RECOGNIZE THAT A LITTLE BIT OF

01:18:04.146 --> 01:18:05.747
PROBATION FOR YOUNG PEOPLE OFTEN

01:18:05.814 --> 01:18:08.316
LEADS TO A LOT OF JAIL. STILL,

01:18:08.383 --> 01:18:10.085
THIS BILL IS REACTIONARY. WE

01:18:10.152 --> 01:18:12.120
BELIEVE IT WILL TAKE OUR STATE

01:18:12.187 --> 01:18:13.422
BACKWARDS AND WE ARE

01:18:13.488 --> 01:18:16.324
RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED. GOOD

01:18:16.391 --> 01:18:18.226
MORNING, CHAIR MEMBERS. MY NAME

01:18:18.293 --> 01:18:18.894
IS AUBREY RODRIGUEZ AND I'M WITH

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:21.263
ACLU CALIFORNIA ACTION. OUR

01:18:21.329 --> 01:18:22.464
ORGANIZATION IS IN STRONG

01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:24.299
OPPOSITION TO SB 19 AS THIS WILL

01:18:24.366 --> 01:18:25.901
ONLY ADD TO CALIFORNIA SCHOOL TO

01:18:25.967 --> 01:18:27.302
PRISON PIPELINE. WHILE EXISTING

01:18:27.369 --> 01:18:28.937
LAW ALREADY PUNISHES CRIMINAL

01:18:29.004 --> 01:18:30.906
THREATS IN ANY SETTING,

01:18:30.972 --> 01:18:32.040
CURRENTLY A PERSON MAKING A

01:18:32.107 --> 01:18:34.009
THREAT CAN BE PROSECUTED AND

01:18:34.076 --> 01:18:35.143
IMPRISONED IF THEY DID NOT HAVE

01:18:35.210 --> 01:18:36.845
THE INTENT OR ABILITY TO CARRY

01:18:36.912 --> 01:18:37.913
OUT THE THREAT, NOR TAKE TAKE

01:18:37.979 --> 01:18:40.315
ANY ACTION TO CARRY IT OUT.

01:18:40.382 --> 01:18:42.751
PENAL CODE 40 422 IS NOTORIOUS

01:18:42.818 --> 01:18:44.586
FOR BEING OVERBROAD AND MISUSED,

01:18:44.653 --> 01:18:47.022
WHERE CHILDREN HAVE ALREADY BEEN

01:18:47.089 --> 01:18:48.323
PROSECUTED FOR SCHOOLYARD

01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:50.158
DISAGREEMENTS, SOCIAL MEDIA,

01:18:50.225 --> 01:18:51.793
SPEECH AND ARTISTIC EXPRESSION,

01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:53.795
SUCH AS A STUDENT WRITING A POEM

01:18:53.862 --> 01:18:54.796
WITH CONTENTS ABOUT SCHOOL

01:18:54.863 --> 01:18:56.932
SHOOTINGS. SB 19 WILL FURTHER

01:18:56.998 --> 01:18:58.266
WORSEN THE CRIMINALIZATION OF

01:18:58.333 --> 01:18:59.734
CALIFORNIA STUDENTS, AND EVEN IF

01:18:59.801 --> 01:19:02.304
THEY ARE FOUND NOT GUILTY, THEY

01:19:02.370 --> 01:19:04.206
SUFFER SIGNIFICANT HARM FROM

01:19:04.272 --> 01:19:05.640
THEIR SYSTEM INVOLVEMENT, SUCH

01:19:05.707 --> 01:19:07.042
AS A LOWER LIKELIHOOD OF

01:19:07.109 --> 01:19:08.076
GRADUATING AND A HIGHER

01:19:08.143 --> 01:19:09.578
LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE

01:19:09.644 --> 01:19:11.279
INCARCERATION. THESE HARMS

01:19:11.346 --> 01:19:12.180
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT BLACK

01:19:12.247 --> 01:19:13.482
AND BROWN STUDENTS AND THOSE

01:19:13.548 --> 01:19:15.484
WITH DISABILITIES. SCHOOLS

01:19:15.550 --> 01:19:17.152
SHOULD BE SAFE, WELCOMING, AND

01:19:17.219 --> 01:19:18.019
AFFIRMING LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS

01:19:18.086 --> 01:19:20.422
FOR ALL STUDENTS, AND WE SHOULD

01:19:20.489 --> 01:19:21.223
TAKE MEASURES TO ENSURE

01:19:21.289 --> 01:19:22.858
CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION'S

01:19:22.924 --> 01:19:25.260
PROMISE OF EQUAL EDUCATIONAL

01:19:25.327 --> 01:19:28.363
OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERY STUDENT,

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:29.898
CREATING NEW TOOLS TO FURTHER

01:19:29.965 --> 01:19:31.199
CRIMINALIZE OUR STUDENTS DOES

01:19:31.266 --> 01:19:32.300
NOT ACTUALIZE THIS VISION, AND

01:19:32.367 --> 01:19:35.604
THIS CONSTITUTIONAL SAFEGUARD OR

01:19:35.670 --> 01:19:37.339
PROMISE. INSTEAD, WE SHOULD

01:19:37.405 --> 01:19:38.807
INVEST IN RESOURCES AND PROGRAMS

01:19:38.874 --> 01:19:40.208
THAT IMPROVE EDUCATIONAL

01:19:40.275 --> 01:19:42.110
OUTCOMES FOR ALL STUDENTS.

01:19:42.177 --> 01:19:43.578

01:19:48.183 --> 01:19:49.518
MILLIONS OF STUDENTS ATTEND

01:19:49.584 --> 01:19:50.886
SCHOOLS WITH POLICE OFFICERS,

01:19:50.952 --> 01:19:52.787
BUT NO COUNSELORS, NURSES,

01:19:52.854 --> 01:19:55.257

01:19:55.323 --> 01:19:56.791
RATHER THAN FEEDING OUR YOUTH TO

01:19:56.858 --> 01:19:58.493

PUNITIVE PENAL CODE, WE SHOULD

PRIORITIZE INVESTING IN THEIR

01:20:03.231 --> 01:20:04.699

01:21:29.050 --> 01:21:30.118
I DO HAVE JUST A QUICK QUESTION

01:21:30.185 --> 01:21:31.319
AND IT'S MOSTLY TOWARDS THE

01:21:31.386 --> 01:21:32.954
OPPOSITION, AND I APPRECIATE THE

01:21:33.021 --> 01:21:34.322
AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THE BILL,

01:21:34.389 --> 01:21:34.923
APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITION FOR

01:21:34.990 --> 01:21:36.024
THEIR TESTIMONY. I MEAN, I

01:21:36.091 --> 01:21:37.892
REALLY VIEW THIS BILL AND WE HAD

01:21:37.959 --> 01:21:38.793
ANOTHER BILL SIMILAR TO THIS

01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:40.729
MOVE THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY THAT'S

01:21:40.795 --> 01:21:42.063
NOW IN THE SENATE. I MEAN, I DO

01:21:42.130 --> 01:21:43.898
THINK THAT IT IS TRYING TO

01:21:43.965 --> 01:21:44.966
ADDRESS A REAL PROBLEM AND A

01:21:45.033 --> 01:21:47.102
REAL SAFETY CONCERN. IF SOMEONE

01:21:47.168 --> 01:21:50.372
HAS REAL CRIMINAL INTENTION AT A

01:21:50.438 --> 01:21:52.907
SCHOOL AND THERE ISN'T A

01:21:52.974 --> 01:21:55.477
SPECIFIC PERSON, BUT THEY THEY

01:21:55.543 --> 01:21:58.313
HAVE PLANS AND WEAPONS TO COMMIT

01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:02.350
REAL HARM FOR FOLKS WHO MAY BE

01:22:02.417 --> 01:22:04.386
AT THE SCHOOL OR WILL BE AT THE

01:22:04.452 --> 01:22:06.688
SCHOOL. AND I GUESS THE WHAT I'M

01:22:06.755 --> 01:22:07.856
STRUGGLING WITH IS HOW THIS IS

01:22:07.922 --> 01:22:09.858
GOING TO LEAD TO MASS

01:22:09.924 --> 01:22:11.159
INCARCERATION OR SOME SORT OF

01:22:11.226 --> 01:22:12.327
DISCRIMINATION TOWARDS CERTAIN

01:22:12.394 --> 01:22:15.363
GROUPS WITH DISABILITIES. WHEN

01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:17.232
THE PROBLEM THAT I SEE IS JUST

01:22:17.299 --> 01:22:19.567
THE SITUATION WHERE SOMEONE DOES

01:22:19.634 --> 01:22:21.503
MAKE A CREDIBLE THREAT AND THEY

01:22:21.569 --> 01:22:23.204
HAVE PLANS, THEY DON'T NAME A

01:22:23.271 --> 01:22:24.606
SPECIFIC PERSON, BUT THEY NAME A

01:22:24.673 --> 01:22:26.207
SCHOOL. THEY HAVE THE ADDRESS.

01:22:26.274 --> 01:22:27.042
AS THE SENATOR SAID. HOW DOES

01:22:27.108 --> 01:22:28.910
THAT LEAD TO MASS INCARCERATION

01:22:28.977 --> 01:22:30.378
OF KIDS? I'M JUST AND I'M

01:22:30.445 --> 01:22:32.113
SYMPATHETIC TO THE CONCERN. I'M

01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:34.349
JUST IT SEEMS LIKE A

01:22:34.416 --> 01:22:35.817
HYPOTHETICAL THAT ACTUALLY ISN'T

01:22:35.884 --> 01:22:37.218
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS IN

01:22:37.285 --> 01:22:39.688
THIS BILL. AND IF THERE IS A WAY

01:22:39.754 --> 01:22:41.489
TO LIMIT THAT CONCERN, I'M ALL

01:22:41.556 --> 01:22:43.091
EARS. YOU KNOW I DO. I DON'T

01:22:43.158 --> 01:22:44.726
WANT THIS TO LEAD TO ANY MASS

01:22:44.793 --> 01:22:46.361
INCARCERATION OF ANYONE,

01:22:46.428 --> 01:22:47.195
ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH CERTAIN

01:22:47.262 --> 01:22:48.963
DISABILITIES OR, YOU KNOW,

01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:50.131
CERTAIN BACKGROUNDS, RACIALLY,

01:22:50.198 --> 01:22:51.733
ETHNICALLY, ETC. SO IF YOU CAN

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:53.034
JUST ADDRESS THAT AND IF YOU

01:22:53.101 --> 01:22:54.936
HAVE ANY, I DON'T AND MAYBE I

01:22:55.003 --> 01:22:57.005
MISSED IT. IF THERE ARE WAYS IN

01:22:57.072 --> 01:22:58.306
WHICH WE CAN ADDRESS THAT, I'M

01:22:58.373 --> 01:23:00.175
ALL EARS. SO THANK YOU. YEAH, I

01:23:00.241 --> 01:23:01.643
APPRECIATE THE QUESTION.

01:23:01.710 --> 01:23:04.512
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. SO WHAT WE'RE

01:23:04.579 --> 01:23:06.481
CITING IS THAT BASICALLY IF YOU

01:23:06.548 --> 01:23:09.217
HAVE ANY EXPOSURE TO THE SYSTEM

01:23:09.284 --> 01:23:11.019
INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF

01:23:11.086 --> 01:23:13.988
FUTURE INCARCERATION. AND WE

01:23:14.055 --> 01:23:15.623
ALSO HAVE A LOT OF DATA, A

01:23:15.690 --> 01:23:17.492
PLETHORA OF IT, THAT OUR JUSTICE

01:23:17.559 --> 01:23:18.893
SYSTEM IS INCREDIBLY RACIST.

01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:21.496
RIGHT. AND YOU HAVE BLACK

01:23:21.563 --> 01:23:23.064
STUDENTS WHO, YOU KNOW, COMMIT

01:23:23.131 --> 01:23:24.799
THE SAME AMOUNT OF CRIME OR GET

01:23:24.866 --> 01:23:25.967
AS MUCH TROUBLE AS WHITE

01:23:26.034 --> 01:23:27.168
STUDENTS, BUT ARE THREE TIMES

01:23:27.235 --> 01:23:28.636
MORE LIKELY REFERRED TO LAW

01:23:28.703 --> 01:23:30.138
ENFORCEMENT. AND THERE IS A LOT

01:23:30.205 --> 01:23:32.273
OF BIASES FROM ADMINISTRATORS OR

01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:33.808
EDUCATORS AND WHOM HAVE YOU THAT

01:23:33.875 --> 01:23:35.076
WILL JUST REFER TO THOSE

01:23:35.143 --> 01:23:36.611
STUDENTS TO THE SYSTEM. AND

01:23:36.678 --> 01:23:38.446
AGAIN, THAT'S WHAT IS FEEDING

01:23:38.513 --> 01:23:39.881
OUR YOUTH TO THE MASS

01:23:39.948 --> 01:23:41.249
INCARCERATION INCARCERATION

01:23:41.316 --> 01:23:43.184
MACHINE. SO WE WANT TO AVOID

01:23:43.251 --> 01:23:45.120
THAT AND TRY TO AVOID AS MUCH

01:23:45.186 --> 01:23:46.187
INVOLVEMENT AS POSSIBLE. WHEREAS

01:23:46.254 --> 01:23:47.722
WE DON'T SEE THIS AS LIKE

01:23:47.789 --> 01:23:48.957
RESOLVING THAT ISSUE AND JUST

01:23:49.023 --> 01:23:51.793
ONLY EXACERBATING IT. AND

01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:53.595
SECTION 4.22 AGAIN ALREADY

01:23:53.661 --> 01:23:55.063
COVERS TRUE THREATS. SO IF

01:23:55.130 --> 01:23:56.698
SOMEONE IS LIKE HAS A CREDIBLE

01:23:56.765 --> 01:23:58.933
THREAT AT A SCHOOL, THEY'RE

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.668
ALREADY GOING TO BE PROSECUTED

01:24:00.735 --> 01:24:02.904
OR THEY CAN BE PROSECUTED. SO WE

01:24:02.971 --> 01:24:04.739
DON'T THINK THIS BILL IS REALLY

01:24:04.806 --> 01:24:06.941
NECESSARY AND WE'LL HAVE ONLY A

01:24:07.008 --> 01:24:08.610
NEGATIVE IMPACT. AND I DON'T

01:24:08.676 --> 01:24:10.178
KNOW, ANGELA, YOU WANT TO. YEAH.

01:24:10.245 --> 01:24:12.247
IF I IF I COULD JUST BRIEFLY ADD

01:24:12.313 --> 01:24:13.948
WHAT OUR COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE

01:24:14.015 --> 01:24:15.917
STATE WHO WORK WITH PARENTS AND

01:24:15.984 --> 01:24:16.918
YOUTH WHO ARE ORGANIZING IN

01:24:16.985 --> 01:24:18.853
SCHOOLS HAVE NOTICED IS THAT

01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:21.389
WHEN THE SITE OF A PENAL CODE

01:24:21.456 --> 01:24:23.124
SECTION IS A SCHOOL, THE PEOPLE

01:24:23.191 --> 01:24:24.893
WHO ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO GET

01:24:24.959 --> 01:24:26.361
CAUGHT UP AND PROSECUTED UNDER

01:24:26.428 --> 01:24:27.729
THAT SECTION ARE THE PEOPLE WHO

01:24:27.796 --> 01:24:29.030
ARE IN SCHOOLS, AND THOSE ARE

01:24:29.097 --> 01:24:30.565
OUR CHILDREN. THOSE ARE OUR

01:24:30.632 --> 01:24:31.633
YOUNG PEOPLE. AND WE ALREADY

01:24:31.699 --> 01:24:33.101
HAVE, AS MY COLLEAGUE NOTED, A

01:24:33.168 --> 01:24:34.135
GREAT LEVEL OF

01:24:34.202 --> 01:24:34.803
DISPROPORTIONALITY IN OUR

01:24:34.869 --> 01:24:36.438
CRIMINAL SYSTEM. ANOTHER THING

01:24:36.504 --> 01:24:37.839
I'D LIKE TO JUST ADD IS THAT

01:24:37.906 --> 01:24:39.340
THIS LEGISLATURE HAS REPEATEDLY

01:24:39.407 --> 01:24:40.575
RECOGNIZED THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE

01:24:40.642 --> 01:24:42.811
NOT LITTLE ADULTS. THERE ARE

01:24:42.877 --> 01:24:46.014
THINGS LIKE IMPETUOUSNESS AND

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:47.882
IMMATURITY AND A LACK OF

01:24:47.949 --> 01:24:48.750
UNDERSTANDING OF CONSEQUENCES

01:24:48.817 --> 01:24:51.519
THAT ARE NOT QUIRKS, ARE NOT

01:24:51.586 --> 01:24:53.054
FEATURES OF YOUTH, BUT ACTUAL

01:24:53.121 --> 01:24:54.722
ARE NOT QUIRKS OF YOUTH, BUT

01:24:54.789 --> 01:24:55.757
ACTUAL FEATURES. THEY'RE NOT

01:24:55.824 --> 01:24:57.459
BUGS. IT'S PART OF THE PROCESS.

01:24:57.525 --> 01:24:58.626
SO JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT

01:24:58.693 --> 01:25:01.062
OUR CONCERN IS ABOUT THOSE YOUNG

01:25:01.129 --> 01:25:03.298
PEOPLE BEING CAUGHT UP IN THE

01:25:03.364 --> 01:25:05.467
SYSTEM. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

01:25:05.533 --> 01:25:07.035
THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. ARE

01:25:07.101 --> 01:25:09.504
THERE OTHER QUESTIONS OR

01:25:09.571 --> 01:25:11.940
COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS

01:25:12.006 --> 01:25:13.775
OKAY WITH THAT? SENATOR RUBIO,

01:25:13.842 --> 01:25:15.076
WOULD YOU LIKE TO PROVIDE A

01:25:15.143 --> 01:25:16.778
BRIEF CLOSING STATEMENT? YES.

01:25:16.845 --> 01:25:19.147
THANK YOU. WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I

01:25:19.214 --> 01:25:20.181
JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT I AM

01:25:20.248 --> 01:25:22.016
A SCHOOL TEACHER IN THE

01:25:22.083 --> 01:25:23.485
CLASSROOM. FOR 20 YEARS, I WAS

01:25:23.551 --> 01:25:25.286
VICE PRINCIPAL FOR THREE YEARS,

01:25:25.353 --> 01:25:28.289
AND WE HAVE HAD MANY INSTANCES

01:25:28.356 --> 01:25:29.924
WHERE WE HAVE TO LOCK DOWN. AND

01:25:29.991 --> 01:25:32.894
SO THE FEAR IS THERE. I KNOW THE

01:25:32.961 --> 01:25:34.229
STATEMENT WAS MADE THAT WE JUST

01:25:34.295 --> 01:25:35.864
WANT TO CREATE FEAR. I JUST NEED

01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:37.565
TO SHARE WITH ALL OF YOU THAT

01:25:37.632 --> 01:25:38.933
THE FEAR IS THERE. OUR TEACHERS

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.869
ARE IN FEAR EVERY SINGLE DAY.

01:25:40.935 --> 01:25:43.037
AND THE PROBLEM IS, YOU KNOW, I

01:25:43.104 --> 01:25:44.906
WANT TO TAKE US BACK TO AN

01:25:44.973 --> 01:25:47.041
INCIDENT THAT I, YOU KNOW, I

01:25:47.108 --> 01:25:47.976
CAN'T GET OUT OF MY HEAD. YOU

01:25:48.042 --> 01:25:49.811
KNOW, THE UVALDE SHOOTING WHERE

01:25:49.878 --> 01:25:51.546
A FOURTH GRADER, WHICH IS A

01:25:51.613 --> 01:25:52.847
GRADE THAT I TEACH HOW TO LAY

01:25:52.914 --> 01:25:54.616
DOWN NEXT TO HIS LITTLE FRIEND

01:25:54.682 --> 01:25:57.452
WHO WAS SHOT AND MURDERED IN A

01:25:57.519 --> 01:25:59.220
SHOOTING. AND IN ORDER TO

01:25:59.287 --> 01:26:00.922
SURVIVE, HE WENT OVER TO HIS

01:26:00.989 --> 01:26:03.424
FRIEND AND TOOK BLOOD OUT OF HIS

01:26:03.491 --> 01:26:05.693
FRIEND'S BODY TO PUT IT ALL OVER

01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:08.496
HIMSELF, TO PRETEND TO BE DEAD,

01:26:08.563 --> 01:26:10.698
TO SAVE HIMSELF. AND WE KNOW

01:26:10.765 --> 01:26:12.100
THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:26:12.166 --> 01:26:13.468
HAPPENED. THE PROBLEM WITH THESE

01:26:13.535 --> 01:26:15.403
THREATS IS WE DON'T KNOW IF IT'S

01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:17.005
REAL OR IF IT'S NOT REAL. SO DO

01:26:17.071 --> 01:26:18.773
WE WAIT UNTIL THAT HAPPENS WHERE

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:20.375
KIDS ARE HAVING TO SAY

01:26:20.441 --> 01:26:21.843
THEMSELVES, WHERE OUR

01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:24.379
COMMUNITIES IN A STATE OF PANIC.

01:26:24.445 --> 01:26:26.915
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I KNOW IS

01:26:26.981 --> 01:26:28.049
ALREADY THERE. THE FEAR IS

01:26:28.116 --> 01:26:29.150
ALREADY THERE. AND AS A TEACHER,

01:26:29.217 --> 01:26:31.452
I CAN TELL YOU, EVERY TIME WE'RE

01:26:31.519 --> 01:26:32.921
ON A LOCKDOWN, YOUR HEART IS

01:26:32.987 --> 01:26:34.022
POUNDING BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW

01:26:34.088 --> 01:26:35.890
WHAT'S COMING AT YOU. SO THIS IS

01:26:35.957 --> 01:26:37.725
NOT INTENDED TO MASS

01:26:37.792 --> 01:26:39.961
INCARCERATE. AND I ALSO AM VERY

01:26:40.028 --> 01:26:40.962
SYMPATHETIC. AND IT'S COMING

01:26:41.029 --> 01:26:42.163
ACROSS A LITTLE STRONG BECAUSE

01:26:42.230 --> 01:26:43.831
IT'S SOMETHING THAT I TAKE VERY

01:26:43.898 --> 01:26:44.999
SERIOUSLY. OUR TEACHERS ARE

01:26:45.066 --> 01:26:45.934
SAYING OVER AND OVER AGAIN, WHAT

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.869
ARE YOU GUYS DOING? AND THIS IS

01:26:47.936 --> 01:26:49.704
NOT ABOUT STUDENTS PER SE. THESE

01:26:49.771 --> 01:26:51.072
ARE OUTSIDERS WHO ARE CONSTANTLY

01:26:51.139 --> 01:26:52.740
MAKING THREATS TO OUR SCHOOLS.

01:26:52.807 --> 01:26:54.542
THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY MORE

01:26:54.609 --> 01:26:55.977
SENSITIVE TO OUR YOUTH BECAUSE

01:26:56.044 --> 01:26:58.212
RIGHT NOW, THEY COULD ALREADY BE

01:26:58.279 --> 01:26:59.614
PROSECUTED FOR A WOBBLER IF IT'S

01:26:59.681 --> 01:27:03.551
A SERIOUS THREAT. THIS ONE MAKES

01:27:03.618 --> 01:27:05.086
SURE THAT OUR YOUTH HAVE THE

01:27:05.153 --> 01:27:06.754
OPPORTUNITY TO BE COUNSELED, NOT

01:27:06.821 --> 01:27:09.290
NECESSARILY GET A FELONY

01:27:09.357 --> 01:27:10.792
STRAIGHT TO JAIL. THAT'S NOT

01:27:10.858 --> 01:27:12.460
WHAT THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO

01:27:12.527 --> 01:27:14.028
DO. AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT AND

01:27:14.095 --> 01:27:16.130
I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:27:16.197 --> 01:27:17.632
GARABEDIAN STATED, YOU KNOW,

01:27:17.699 --> 01:27:19.133
DISABILITIES, STUDENTS WITH

01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:20.001
DISABILITIES, STUDENTS THAT

01:27:20.068 --> 01:27:21.970
DON'T KNOW CONSEQUENCES, IT IS

01:27:22.036 --> 01:27:23.805
VERY CLEARLY STATED. IT HAS TO

01:27:23.871 --> 01:27:26.174
BE A CREDIBLE, SERIOUS THREAT.

01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:27.308
AND I DO APPRECIATE THAT

01:27:27.375 --> 01:27:28.776
SOMETIMES WHEN STUDENTS ARE

01:27:28.843 --> 01:27:30.044
SPOKEN TO, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE

01:27:30.111 --> 01:27:31.613
RIGHT. SOMETIMES ONCE THEY'RE IN

01:27:31.679 --> 01:27:33.247
THE SYSTEM, IT'S HARDER TO GET

01:27:33.314 --> 01:27:35.350
OUT OF THAT CYCLE. BUT THIS IS

01:27:35.416 --> 01:27:37.051
JUST MEANT TO GIVE ANOTHER LAYER

01:27:37.118 --> 01:27:39.320
OF PROTECTION TO OUR OUR

01:27:39.387 --> 01:27:41.222
SCHOOLS, OUR STUDENTS AND PLACES

01:27:41.289 --> 01:27:42.890
OF WORSHIP. BUT MY INTENTION IS

01:27:42.957 --> 01:27:44.392
NOT TO INCARCERATE. AND I CAN

01:27:44.459 --> 01:27:45.827
TELL YOU AS A TEACHER, THAT'S

01:27:45.893 --> 01:27:47.729
NEVER BEEN MY INTENTION. BUT I

01:27:47.795 --> 01:27:49.631
DO THINK THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHEN

01:27:49.697 --> 01:27:51.099
THAT THREAT IS CREDIBLE OR NOT.

01:27:51.165 --> 01:27:52.834
AND WE HAVE TO STOP EVERYTHING.

01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:55.036
WE HAVE TO SHUT DOWN. WE HAVE TO

01:27:55.103 --> 01:27:55.937
DISRUPT LEARNING. WE HAVE TO

01:27:56.004 --> 01:27:57.672
SPEND THOSE RESOURCES THAT I

01:27:57.739 --> 01:27:59.073
AGREE WITH. YOU SHOULD BE SPENT

01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:00.942
IN COUNSELING, BECAUSE I WAS IN

01:28:01.009 --> 01:28:02.243
A SCHOOL WHERE WE HAD THREE

01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:03.444
COUNSELORS AND THEN THEY

01:28:03.511 --> 01:28:04.646
DISAPPEARED. SO BUT WE CAN'T

01:28:04.712 --> 01:28:07.015
KEEP SPENDING THESE RESOURCES

01:28:07.081 --> 01:28:09.450
AND SOMETHING THAT'S A JOKE OR A

01:28:09.517 --> 01:28:11.486
HOAX WHEN WE DO NEED TO PUT THEM

01:28:11.552 --> 01:28:12.787
IN COUNSELING AND MAKE SURE THAT

01:28:12.854 --> 01:28:14.522
WE TAKE CARE OF THIS VERY

01:28:14.589 --> 01:28:16.491
SERIOUS ISSUE. BUT SORRY, LONG

01:28:16.557 --> 01:28:18.426
WINDED, BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT WE

01:28:18.493 --> 01:28:19.961
ARE TRYING TO SOLVE A PROBLEM

01:28:20.028 --> 01:28:22.463
THAT DOES EXIST, AND WE NEED TO

01:28:22.530 --> 01:28:23.865
CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE KIDS

01:28:23.931 --> 01:28:25.667
ARE NOT GOING TO SCHOOL IN FEAR,

01:28:25.733 --> 01:28:27.101
AND OUR TEACHERS ARE NOT ALWAYS

01:28:27.168 --> 01:28:29.671
IN A STATE OF PANIC AS WELL. SO

01:28:29.737 --> 01:28:30.538
WITH THAT, I RESPECTFULLY ASK

01:28:30.605 --> 01:28:32.306
FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY

01:28:32.373 --> 01:28:34.075
MUCH, SENATOR. I JUST WANT TO

01:28:34.142 --> 01:28:35.877
THANK ALL OF OUR WITNESSES AND

01:28:35.943 --> 01:28:37.211
OF COURSE, YOU AS OUR AUTHOR,

01:28:37.278 --> 01:28:38.980
FOR WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A VERY

01:28:39.047 --> 01:28:40.448
SPIRITED AND YET REALLY

01:28:40.515 --> 01:28:41.582
PROFESSIONAL ENGAGEMENT OF THE

01:28:41.649 --> 01:28:43.651
ISSUE. THE CHAIR IS RECOMMENDING

01:28:43.718 --> 01:28:45.253
AN AYE, IT IS NOT LOST UPON ME.

01:28:45.319 --> 01:28:47.088
I AGREE WITH MOST OF EVERYTHING

01:28:47.155 --> 01:28:47.989
THAT THE OPPOSITION WITNESSES

01:28:48.056 --> 01:28:49.791
HAVE TO SAY. WE HAVE A JUSTICE

01:28:49.857 --> 01:28:50.925
SYSTEM THAT IS FLAWED AND

01:28:50.992 --> 01:28:52.560
BROKEN. WE SEE THE

01:28:52.627 --> 01:28:53.161
DISCRIMINATORY APPLICATION OF

01:28:53.227 --> 01:28:55.096
LAWS BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE SEE

01:28:55.163 --> 01:28:56.664
SELECTIVE PROSECUTION FROM

01:28:56.731 --> 01:28:58.499
PROSECUTORS OFFICE OFFICES THAT

01:28:58.566 --> 01:28:59.834
ARE FULFILLING A POLITICAL

01:28:59.901 --> 01:29:01.769
AGENDA. WE HAVE DIFFERENT

01:29:01.836 --> 01:29:02.670
APPLICATION OF SENTENCING LAWS

01:29:02.737 --> 01:29:04.472
IN THE COURTS. SO I COMPLETELY

01:29:04.539 --> 01:29:07.075
YOUR POINT, LANDS WITH ME AND

01:29:07.141 --> 01:29:08.810
HITS ME IN A WAY THAT WE HAVE TO

01:29:08.876 --> 01:29:10.645
DO BETTER. I COMPLETELY AGREE

01:29:10.712 --> 01:29:11.813
WITH THAT. I ALSO AGREE WITH THE

01:29:11.879 --> 01:29:13.147
SENATOR'S POINT THAT HER

01:29:13.214 --> 01:29:14.348
APPROACH IN THIS BILL DOES LOOK

01:29:14.415 --> 01:29:17.118
AT YOUTH OFFENDERS, AND DOES TRY

01:29:17.185 --> 01:29:17.852
TO TAKE A DIFFERENT APPROACH

01:29:17.919 --> 01:29:19.420
THAN MANY OF THE EXISTING LAWS

01:29:19.487 --> 01:29:21.122
WE HAVE ON THE BOOKS. IT'S EVEN

01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:22.824
AN IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT

01:29:22.890 --> 01:29:24.792
ASSEMBLY BILL 237, WHICH PASSED

01:29:24.859 --> 01:29:26.694
OUT OF OUR COMMITTEE, DIDN'T

01:29:26.761 --> 01:29:27.228
TAKE THE APPROACH THAT THE

01:29:27.295 --> 01:29:28.796
SENATOR IS CONTEMPLATING, AND I

01:29:28.863 --> 01:29:30.098
THINK THAT IT'S A GOOD APPROACH

01:29:30.164 --> 01:29:31.999
TO TAKE. THE LAST THING I WOULD

01:29:32.066 --> 01:29:33.801
NOTE IS THAT, AND I WON'T GO

01:29:33.868 --> 01:29:34.802
THROUGH THE MANY CASES THAT ARE

01:29:34.869 --> 01:29:36.571
LISTED, BUT I WOULD DIRECT

01:29:36.637 --> 01:29:37.238
EVERYONE'S ATTENTION TO PAGE

01:29:37.305 --> 01:29:39.040
FIVE OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS.

01:29:39.107 --> 01:29:41.309
BOTH OF YOU ARE CORRECT. PENAL

01:29:41.375 --> 01:29:43.411
CODE SECTION 422 CAN AND IS

01:29:43.478 --> 01:29:45.379
UTILIZED TO PROSECUTE MORE

01:29:45.446 --> 01:29:46.647
GENERALIZED THREATS. BUT WE ALSO

01:29:46.714 --> 01:29:48.049
SEE THAT IT IS NOT EQUALLY

01:29:48.116 --> 01:29:49.684
APPLIED ACROSS THE STATE OF

01:29:49.751 --> 01:29:50.952
CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE WIDE

01:29:51.018 --> 01:29:52.453
DISCREPANCIES IN WHETHER THAT IS

01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:53.688
SUCCESSFULLY USED TO PROSECUTE.

01:29:53.755 --> 01:29:55.456
AND LARGELY IT DEPENDS ON WHO'S

01:29:55.523 --> 01:29:56.691
SITTING IN THE PROSECUTOR'S

01:29:56.758 --> 01:29:57.925
OFFICE AND WHO'S WEARING THE

01:29:57.992 --> 01:29:59.193
BLACK ROBE AND HOW THEY

01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:00.695
INTERPRET THAT STATUTE. I VIEW

01:30:00.762 --> 01:30:01.763
SENATOR RUBIO'S BILL AS

01:30:01.829 --> 01:30:03.264
ATTEMPTING TO CLARIFY THE INTENT

01:30:03.331 --> 01:30:05.066
OF THE LEGISLATURE AND TO

01:30:05.133 --> 01:30:06.467
CLARIFY WHAT CONDUCT IS AND

01:30:06.534 --> 01:30:07.769
SHOULD BE CAPTURED IN THE COURSE

01:30:07.835 --> 01:30:10.104
OF THAT PENAL CODE SECTION. SO I

01:30:10.171 --> 01:30:11.773
KNOW THE BILL WILL CONTINUE TO

01:30:11.839 --> 01:30:13.474
EVOLVE. I HOPE I LOOK FORWARD,

01:30:13.541 --> 01:30:14.942
AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL

01:30:15.009 --> 01:30:16.144
CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS

01:30:16.210 --> 01:30:18.079
TO SEE IF YOU CAN IMPROVE THE

01:30:18.146 --> 01:30:20.114
BILL. IT'S ALWAYS A WORK IN

01:30:20.181 --> 01:30:21.682
PROGRESS, AS THEY SAY. BUT WITH

01:30:21.749 --> 01:30:23.484
THAT, I AM RECOMMENDING AN AYE

01:30:23.551 --> 01:30:24.919

RESONATED WITH CITIES AND TOWNS

01:33:41.449 --> 01:33:43.517
ACROSS CALIFORNIA, HIGHLIGHTING

01:33:43.584 --> 01:33:45.786

SUPERVISION. SENATE BILL 759

01:33:52.226 --> 01:33:54.695
WOULD REQUIRE THE COUNTY AGENCY

01:33:54.762 --> 01:33:56.464
SUPERVISING THE RELEASE AND

01:33:56.530 --> 01:33:58.599

INTENDED TO MITIGATE THE

01:34:36.971 --> 01:34:38.672

01:37:47.328 --> 01:37:49.230
GOOD MORNING. LIEUTENANT LEÃN,

01:37:49.296 --> 01:37:50.831
REPRESENTING RIVERSIDE COUNTY

01:37:50.898 --> 01:37:55.369
SHERIFF CHAD BIANCO IN SUPPORT.

01:37:55.436 --> 01:37:56.604

ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. THANK

01:38:00.374 --> 01:38:04.144
YOU. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN

01:38:04.211 --> 01:38:16.757
OPPOSITION FOR THIS BILL?

01:38:16.824 --> 01:38:19.860
WHEN YOU'RE READY, YOU'LL HAVE

01:38:19.927 --> 01:38:24.398
FIVE MINUTES. GOOD MORNING,

01:38:24.465 --> 01:38:26.500
CHAIR AND MEMBERS. MY NAME IS

01:38:26.567 --> 01:38:28.035
FORREST JONES. I'M A MEMBER OF

01:38:28.102 --> 01:38:29.770
THE ELLA BAKER CENTER FOR HUMAN

01:38:29.837 --> 01:38:31.338
RIGHTS AND THE MSW STUDENT AT

01:38:31.405 --> 01:38:33.707
CAL STATE UNIVERSITY BAY. I AM

01:38:33.774 --> 01:38:35.576
ALSO A FORMER THREE STRIKER WHO

01:38:35.643 --> 01:38:37.244
WAS RELEASED IN 2019 AND

01:38:37.311 --> 01:38:38.846
DISCHARGED FROM PAROLE TWO YEARS

01:38:38.912 --> 01:38:42.316
LATER. I AM HERE IN RESPECTFUL

01:38:42.383 --> 01:38:44.585
OPPOSITION TO SENATE BILL 759 BY

01:38:44.652 --> 01:38:47.154
SENATOR ARCHULETA. WHILE MY

01:38:47.221 --> 01:38:48.188
EXPERIENCE ON PAROLE WAS

01:38:48.255 --> 01:38:49.590
SUCCESSFUL AND I HAD A FAIR

01:38:49.657 --> 01:38:51.191
PAROLE OFFICER, THAT EXPERIENCE

01:38:51.258 --> 01:38:54.161
IS NOT THE NORM. SENATE BILL 759

01:38:54.228 --> 01:38:55.863
WOULD REQUIRE PROBATION

01:38:55.929 --> 01:38:57.431
DEPARTMENTS TO PETITION FOR

01:38:57.498 --> 01:38:59.199
REVOCATION OF THE PERSON ON

01:38:59.266 --> 01:39:01.068
SUPERVISION, HAS THREE TECHNICAL

01:39:01.135 --> 01:39:02.436
VIOLATIONS AND A NEW FELONY OR

01:39:02.503 --> 01:39:04.638
MISDEMEANOR. I WITNESSED PEOPLE

01:39:04.705 --> 01:39:06.173
WHO RECEIVED TECHNICAL

01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:07.574
VIOLATIONS FOR MINOR INFRACTIONS

01:39:07.641 --> 01:39:09.476
THAT WERE NOT WARRANTED RETURN

01:39:09.543 --> 01:39:10.844
TO PRISON, SUCH AS MISSING A

01:39:10.911 --> 01:39:12.946
CURFEW BECAUSE THEIR SHIFT RAN

01:39:13.013 --> 01:39:15.215
LATE, A GPS MONITOR DYING DUE TO

01:39:15.282 --> 01:39:18.118
A LACK OF CHARGING OPTIONS, OR

01:39:18.185 --> 01:39:19.019
SOMEONE MISSING A MEETING

01:39:19.086 --> 01:39:21.288
BECAUSE THE BUS WAS RUNNING LATE.

01:39:21.355 --> 01:39:22.623
AFTER SOMEONE IS RELEASED FROM

01:39:22.690 --> 01:39:24.558
PRISON, THERE IS A PERIOD OF

01:39:24.625 --> 01:39:25.659
ACCLIMATION, ESPECIALLY FOR

01:39:25.726 --> 01:39:27.394
PEOPLE WHO HAVE SERVED LONG

01:39:27.461 --> 01:39:28.762
SENTENCES. OFTEN, THESE

01:39:28.829 --> 01:39:30.130
TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS ARE A SIGN

01:39:30.197 --> 01:39:31.932
THAT SOMEONE NEEDS GREATER

01:39:31.999 --> 01:39:33.534
ACCESS TO RESOURCES AND

01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:36.070
SERVICES, NOT INCARCERATION.

01:39:36.136 --> 01:39:37.771
THIS BILL, LIKE THE CALIFORNIA

01:39:37.838 --> 01:39:39.506
THREE STRIKE LAW, FOCUSES ON

01:39:39.573 --> 01:39:42.142
PUNISHING A PERSON FOR THREE

01:39:42.209 --> 01:39:42.876
OFFENSES WITHOUT FOCUSING ON THE

01:39:42.943 --> 01:39:44.645
CAUSE OF THE RECIDIVIST BEHAVIOR

01:39:44.712 --> 01:39:47.014
AND ADDRESSING OUR BEHAVIOR WHEN

01:39:47.081 --> 01:39:48.949
IT COMES TO THESE TECHNICAL

01:39:49.016 --> 01:39:49.817
VIOLATIONS AND THE COMMISSION OF

01:39:49.883 --> 01:39:51.418
A NEW CRIME, WHICH COULD BE

01:39:51.485 --> 01:39:52.920
SIMPLY DRIVING WITHOUT A LICENSE

01:39:52.986 --> 01:39:55.022
OR LOW LEVEL DRUG OFFENSE, WE

01:39:55.089 --> 01:39:56.857
SHOULD SEEK ALTERNATIVE

01:39:56.924 --> 01:39:58.759
SOLUTIONS THAT DO NOT REQUIRE

01:39:58.826 --> 01:40:00.494
INCARCERATION, SUCH AS

01:40:00.561 --> 01:40:02.730
RESTORATIVE JUSTICE, AND OFFER

01:40:02.796 --> 01:40:03.831
GREATER SUPPORT AND RESOURCES

01:40:03.897 --> 01:40:05.966
WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITY.

01:40:06.033 --> 01:40:07.067
ULTIMATELY, WE MUST AVOID

01:40:07.134 --> 01:40:08.535
SENDING MORE PEOPLE BACK TO

01:40:08.602 --> 01:40:09.636
PRISON AND ENSURE THEY ARE

01:40:09.703 --> 01:40:11.071
SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR PAROLE AND

01:40:11.138 --> 01:40:13.240
PCR JOURNEY. EACH TIME WE SEND

01:40:13.307 --> 01:40:15.042
SOMEONE BACK TO PRISON, WE

01:40:15.109 --> 01:40:15.843
DESTABILIZE THEM FURTHER. DUE TO

01:40:15.909 --> 01:40:17.878
THE LOSS OF A JOB, HOUSING, AND

01:40:17.945 --> 01:40:19.346
THE CONNECTION TO THE FAMILY.

01:40:19.413 --> 01:40:21.515
FOR THIS REASON, I MUST

01:40:21.582 --> 01:40:22.883
RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SENATE BILL

01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:26.720
759. GOOD MORNING, LESLIE

01:40:26.787 --> 01:40:28.155
CALDWELL HOUSTON FOR THE

01:40:28.222 --> 01:40:30.357
CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS

01:40:30.424 --> 01:40:31.692
ASSOCIATION, IN RESPECTFUL

01:40:31.759 --> 01:40:35.062
OPPOSITION TO SB 759, AS AMENDED

01:40:35.129 --> 01:40:36.864
BY THE SENATOR. THANK YOU FOR

01:40:36.930 --> 01:40:40.501
THE AMENDMENTS. WE MUST OPPOSE

01:40:40.567 --> 01:40:42.503
THIS BILL, WHICH TAKES AWAY

01:40:42.569 --> 01:40:44.772
DISCRETION FROM COUNTY AGENCIES

01:40:44.838 --> 01:40:46.206
TASKED WITH SUPERVISING

01:40:46.273 --> 01:40:48.175
INDIVIDUALS ON POST-RELEASE

01:40:48.242 --> 01:40:50.744
COMMUNITY SUPERVISION. I CANNOT

01:40:50.811 --> 01:40:52.713
MATCH THE ELOQUENCE OF MY

01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:54.448
COLLEAGUE, BUT I DO HAVE 40

01:40:54.515 --> 01:40:57.084
YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WITH THIS

01:40:57.151 --> 01:40:59.520
SYSTEM, REPRESENTING INDIGENT

01:40:59.586 --> 01:41:01.388
DEFENDANTS. SOME CHANGES FOR THE

01:41:01.455 --> 01:41:03.424
GOOD I'VE SEEN, AND MANY FOR THE

01:41:03.490 --> 01:41:05.759
WORSE. THIS BILL DOES NOT SOLVE

01:41:05.826 --> 01:41:09.062
OR EVEN ADDRESS ANY REAL

01:41:09.129 --> 01:41:11.498
PRESSING ISSUE. CURRENTLY,

01:41:11.565 --> 01:41:13.300
SUPERVISING COUNTY AGENCIES ARE

01:41:13.367 --> 01:41:15.135
TASKED WITH SUPERVISING THOSE ON

01:41:15.202 --> 01:41:16.437
POST-RELEASE COMMUNITY

01:41:16.503 --> 01:41:19.740
SUPERVISION VIOLATIONS. SB 759

01:41:19.807 --> 01:41:22.609
WOULD REMOVE THIS DISCRETION AND

01:41:22.676 --> 01:41:25.479
REQUIRE SUPERVISING COUNTY

01:41:25.546 --> 01:41:27.314
SUPERVISING COUNTY PERSONNEL TO

01:41:27.381 --> 01:41:30.284
BYPASS POTENTIAL INTERMEDIATE

01:41:30.350 --> 01:41:32.085
SANCTIONS, AND INSTEAD REQUIRE

01:41:32.152 --> 01:41:33.821
THEM TO PETITION THE COURT TO

01:41:33.887 --> 01:41:36.256
REVOKE, MODIFY, OR TERMINATE

01:41:36.323 --> 01:41:37.825
POST-RELEASE COMMUNITY

01:41:37.891 --> 01:41:39.960
SUPERVISION. THIS REQUIRED

01:41:40.027 --> 01:41:42.429
FORMAL PROCESS WOULD CAUSE COURT

01:41:42.496 --> 01:41:44.865
CALENDARS TO GROW ACROSS THE

01:41:44.932 --> 01:41:46.300
STATE, SIPHONING OFF RESOURCES

01:41:46.366 --> 01:41:48.101
THAT COULD BE BETTER USED IN

01:41:48.168 --> 01:41:50.737
OTHER AREAS. SADLY, THE

01:41:50.804 --> 01:41:54.808
WITNESSES ARE MISTAKEN. THE JAIL

01:41:54.875 --> 01:41:56.643
POPULATIONS WILL GROW.

01:41:56.710 --> 01:41:58.512
CURRENTLY, JAIL POPULATIONS ARE

01:41:58.579 --> 01:41:59.880
GROWING. COURT CALENDARS ARE

01:41:59.947 --> 01:42:02.483
OVER. AGENDIZED DEPUTY DISTRICT

01:42:02.549 --> 01:42:03.951
ATTORNEYS CASELOADS HAVE

01:42:04.017 --> 01:42:05.819
EXPANDED, AND PUBLIC DEFENDER

01:42:05.886 --> 01:42:07.354
OFFICES AND COUNTY INDIGENT

01:42:07.421 --> 01:42:09.156
DEFENSE COMMITTEES ARE OVERRUN

01:42:09.223 --> 01:42:11.191
WITH CASES. SEVERAL PUBLIC

01:42:11.258 --> 01:42:13.393
DEFENDER OFFICES HAVE GONE

01:42:13.460 --> 01:42:14.962
UNAVAILABLE DUE TO OVERLOAD, AND

01:42:15.028 --> 01:42:16.597
THE COMMITTEES IN ANY GIVEN

01:42:16.663 --> 01:42:18.799
COUNTY THAT FIND PRIVATE COUNSEL

01:42:18.866 --> 01:42:20.434
FOR INDIGENT DEFENDANTS CANNOT

01:42:20.501 --> 01:42:22.703
MEET THEIR MANDATE TO DO SO.

01:42:22.769 --> 01:42:25.272
THIS IS THE SITUATION RIGHT NOW

01:42:25.339 --> 01:42:28.108
DUE TO PROPOSITION 36 CHANGES IN

01:42:28.175 --> 01:42:31.545
THE SYSTEM. IT MAKES NO SENSE TO

01:42:31.612 --> 01:42:33.180
REQUIRE SUPERVISING COUNTY

01:42:33.247 --> 01:42:34.748
AGENCIES TO PROCEED WITH

01:42:34.815 --> 01:42:37.150
HARSHER, HARSHER PENALTIES WHEN

01:42:37.217 --> 01:42:39.119
APPLICATION OF THEIR ASSESSMENT

01:42:39.186 --> 01:42:40.754
PROCESSES HAVE BEEN DETERMINED

01:42:40.821 --> 01:42:43.323
THAT LESSER SANCTIONS ARE MORE

01:42:43.390 --> 01:42:44.758
APPROPRIATE. I PERSONALLY

01:42:44.825 --> 01:42:47.294
WATCHED THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES

01:42:47.361 --> 01:42:49.930
DEVELOP THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE IN

01:42:49.997 --> 01:42:53.033
PLACE NOW. WE SHOULD NOT FILL

01:42:53.100 --> 01:42:56.637
THE COURT'S CALENDARS AND THE

01:42:56.703 --> 01:43:00.374
LAWYERS CASELOADS AND THE JAILS.

01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:03.443
IT MAKES NO SENSE TO PASS THIS

01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:05.979
BILL, AND WE'D ASK THAT YOU VOTE

01:43:06.046 --> 01:43:08.081
NO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU BOTH

01:43:08.148 --> 01:43:09.816
FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. IS THERE

01:43:09.883 --> 01:43:10.651
ANYONE FROM THE PUBLIC IN

01:43:10.717 --> 01:43:12.052
OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL? PLEASE

01:43:12.119 --> 01:43:13.287
COME STAY YOUR NAME,

01:43:13.353 --> 01:43:14.388
ORGANIZATION, YOUR POSITION,

01:43:14.454 --> 01:43:15.889
PLEASE. DANICA, ON BEHALF OF

01:43:15.956 --> 01:43:19.726
INITIATE JUSTICE IN OPPOSITION.

01:43:19.793 --> 01:43:21.461
IVY RODRIGUEZ WITH ACLU,

01:43:21.528 --> 01:43:23.830
CALIFORNIA ACTION AND STRONG

01:43:23.897 --> 01:43:28.001
OPPOSITION. ON BEHALF OF THE

01:43:28.068 --> 01:43:29.169
ELLA BAKER CENTER FOR HUMAN

01:43:29.236 --> 01:43:34.474
RIGHTS. IN OPPOSITION. ON BEHALF

01:43:34.541 --> 01:43:35.842
OF ANTI POLICE TERROR PROJECT

01:43:35.909 --> 01:43:39.012
AND STRONG OPPOSITION. THANK

01:43:39.079 --> 01:43:41.548
YOU. SEEING NO OTHER. ARE THERE

01:43:41.615 --> 01:43:42.082
ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS

01:43:42.149 --> 01:43:43.116
TURNING IT OVER TO THE

01:43:43.183 --> 01:43:43.951
COMMITTEE, MR. HAIRABEDIAN THANK

01:43:44.017 --> 01:43:45.752
YOU, MR. CHAIR. THANK YOU TO THE

01:43:45.819 --> 01:43:47.621
AUTHOR AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR

01:43:47.688 --> 01:43:48.789
SERVICE. YOU KNOW, SENATOR

01:43:48.855 --> 01:43:50.090
ARCHULETA, A LOT OF FOLKS DON'T

01:43:50.157 --> 01:43:52.092
KNOW, SERVED AS A POLICE OFFICER

01:43:52.159 --> 01:43:53.860
FOR MANY YEARS IN THE CITY OF

01:43:53.927 --> 01:43:54.628
MONTEBELLO AND HAS SEEN MANY OF

01:43:54.695 --> 01:43:55.796
THESE ISSUES FIRSTHAND. SO I

01:43:55.862 --> 01:43:57.798
JUST WANT TO THANK YOU, SIR, FOR

01:43:57.864 --> 01:43:59.967
YOUR SERVICE AND APPRECIATE THE

01:44:00.033 --> 01:44:00.634
BILL, APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITION

01:44:00.701 --> 01:44:01.602
TESTIMONY. I YOU KNOW, I WAS

01:44:01.668 --> 01:44:02.836
MOST SYMPATHETIC, I GUESS, TO

01:44:02.903 --> 01:44:04.605
THE CRITIQUE OF TAKING

01:44:04.671 --> 01:44:06.640
JURISDICTION AWAY FROM PROBATION

01:44:06.707 --> 01:44:07.908
DEPARTMENTS. AND I DO THINK THAT

01:44:07.975 --> 01:44:10.110
THE TESTIMONY THAT WE HEARD WAS

01:44:10.177 --> 01:44:11.578
POWERFUL. HOWEVER, I WILL NOTE

01:44:11.645 --> 01:44:13.146
THAT THE PROBATION DEPARTMENTS

01:44:13.213 --> 01:44:13.714
AND THE PROBATION OFFICERS

01:44:13.780 --> 01:44:15.015
ACTUALLY DON'T OPPOSE THIS BILL.

01:44:15.082 --> 01:44:16.917
AND I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE FROM

01:44:16.984 --> 01:44:18.819
THE PROBATION DEPARTMENTS, ANY

01:44:18.885 --> 01:44:20.787
OF THEM ARE HERE. BUT I THINK

01:44:20.854 --> 01:44:22.055
THE REALITY AND THE PRACTICALITY

01:44:22.122 --> 01:44:23.423
OF THIS ISSUE THAT THE SENATOR

01:44:23.490 --> 01:44:25.892
IS TRYING TO ADDRESS IS THAT OUR

01:44:25.959 --> 01:44:27.160
PROBATION DEPARTMENTS ARE

01:44:27.227 --> 01:44:28.595
OVERWORKED, THEIR CASELOADS ARE

01:44:28.662 --> 01:44:30.130
VERY LARGE, AND THEY GET LARGER

01:44:30.197 --> 01:44:31.832
BY THE DAY. AND I THINK THERE

01:44:31.898 --> 01:44:36.536
HAS TO BE A SOLUTION THAT ALLOWS

01:44:36.603 --> 01:44:37.537
FOR SOMETHING TO CHANGE. WHEN IT

01:44:37.604 --> 01:44:39.106
COMES TO THIS, I DON'T THINK

01:44:39.172 --> 01:44:41.208
THAT THE SOLUTION IS JUST TO

01:44:41.274 --> 01:44:43.343
PILE UPON THE PROBATION

01:44:43.410 --> 01:44:44.411
DEPARTMENTS MORE AND MORE WORK

01:44:44.478 --> 01:44:46.046
AND MORE AND MORE CASES, BECAUSE

01:44:46.113 --> 01:44:47.781
WE'VE SEEN THE RESULTS OF THAT,

01:44:47.848 --> 01:44:50.217
ESPECIALLY IN LA COUNTY. AND SO

01:44:50.283 --> 01:44:52.653
I JUST THINK THAT THE OPPOSITION

01:44:52.719 --> 01:44:54.421
WOULD BE MORE POWERFUL, AND I

01:44:54.488 --> 01:44:56.056
THINK MORE SYMPATHY WOULD BE

01:44:56.123 --> 01:44:57.858
GIVEN FOR ME AND MAYBE OTHER

01:44:57.924 --> 01:44:59.926
MEMBERS IF WE ACTUALLY HAD A

01:44:59.993 --> 01:45:00.460
SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM.

01:45:00.527 --> 01:45:02.562
BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT I WANT

01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:03.830
TO THANK THE VICE MAYOR FROM

01:45:03.897 --> 01:45:05.032
FROM WHITTIER FOR BEING HERE. I

01:45:05.098 --> 01:45:07.100
DO THINK THAT THERE ARE REAL

01:45:07.167 --> 01:45:08.201
CONSEQUENCES TO THE CURRENT

01:45:08.268 --> 01:45:10.037
SYSTEM, AND I DO THINK THAT WE

01:45:10.103 --> 01:45:11.772
NEED TO HAVE BETTER SOLUTIONS.

01:45:11.838 --> 01:45:13.607
AND I THINK THIS BILL IS A STEP

01:45:13.674 --> 01:45:16.243
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. SO, YOU

01:45:16.309 --> 01:45:18.078
KNOW, I AM GOING TO BE MOVING

01:45:18.145 --> 01:45:19.312
THE BILL AND SUPPORTING IT. BUT

01:45:19.379 --> 01:45:20.914
AGAIN, I THINK THAT TO THE

01:45:20.981 --> 01:45:21.948
EXTENT THAT WE'RE MAKING THE

01:45:22.015 --> 01:45:23.684
ARGUMENT THAT THE THAT WE'RE

01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:24.918
TAKING SOME SORT OF JURISDICTION

01:45:24.985 --> 01:45:26.119
AWAY OR RESPONSIBILITY AWAY FROM

01:45:26.186 --> 01:45:27.254
A CERTAIN DEPARTMENT, WHEN WE

01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:28.388
DON'T HEAR FROM THAT DEPARTMENT,

01:45:28.455 --> 01:45:29.556
WHEN THEY DON'T OPPOSE THE

01:45:29.623 --> 01:45:31.191
ACTUAL BILL. I JUST THINK THAT'S

01:45:31.258 --> 01:45:32.659
PROBLEMATIC. SO I APPRECIATE THE

01:45:32.726 --> 01:45:34.027
OFFER. AND AGAIN, I'LL MOVE IT

01:45:34.094 --> 01:45:36.029
AND I'LL SUPPORT IT. THANK YOU,

01:45:36.096 --> 01:45:38.298
MR. HARVEY. IT'S BEEN MOVED. IS

01:45:38.365 --> 01:45:39.199
THERE A SECOND? SECOND, SECONDED

01:45:39.266 --> 01:45:41.501
BY ALANIZ. ANY OTHER COMMITTEE

01:45:41.568 --> 01:45:44.905
MEMBERS HAVE ANY COMMENTS? OKAY.

01:45:44.971 --> 01:45:46.039
SEEING OR HEARING NONE. IF THE

01:45:46.106 --> 01:45:48.308
AUTHOR WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. WELL

01:45:48.375 --> 01:45:49.910
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. AND

01:45:49.976 --> 01:45:51.645
MEMBERS. AND I THINK THAT ALL OF

01:45:51.712 --> 01:45:52.879
US ARE LISTENING TO OUR

01:45:52.946 --> 01:45:53.980
COMMUNITIES. AND I KNOW THAT I

01:45:54.047 --> 01:45:56.583
WAS HOPING THAT TOM LACHEY WOULD

01:45:56.650 --> 01:45:58.285
BE HERE BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND HE

01:45:58.351 --> 01:46:00.454
JUST LOST AN OFFICER IN HIS

01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:02.889
DISTRICT FOR THE SAME IDENTICAL

01:46:02.956 --> 01:46:06.493
REASON AND CIRCUMSTANCES. AND MY

01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:08.328
CONDOLENCES OUT TO HIM AND HIS

01:46:08.395 --> 01:46:10.030
FRIENDS AND HIS COMMUNITY, AND

01:46:10.097 --> 01:46:12.265
TO ALL OF US WHO HAVE FRIENDS IN

01:46:12.332 --> 01:46:13.600
LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND THIS IS WHY

01:46:13.667 --> 01:46:15.068
EVERY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY IN

01:46:15.135 --> 01:46:17.537
THE STATE, AND THOSE OF US WHO

01:46:17.604 --> 01:46:20.107
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T

01:46:20.173 --> 01:46:21.675
FORGET THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS

01:46:21.742 --> 01:46:24.144
NEED THE REHAB PROCESS AND

01:46:24.211 --> 01:46:25.612
REHABILITATION IS SO IMPORTANT.

01:46:25.679 --> 01:46:28.115
AND IT DOES THAT. AND AGAIN, IT

01:46:28.181 --> 01:46:30.183
ALLOWS THE INDIVIDUAL TO GO BACK

01:46:30.250 --> 01:46:31.818
TO THE COURT AND SEE WHERE THE

01:46:31.885 --> 01:46:33.620
COURTS CAN HELP. AND I THINK

01:46:33.687 --> 01:46:35.288
THAT WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE

01:46:35.355 --> 01:46:36.456
ANYONE, BUT WE CERTAINLY DON'T

01:46:36.523 --> 01:46:37.858
WANT TO LOSE LIVES. AND WITH

01:46:37.924 --> 01:46:39.626
THAT I URGENTLY ASK FOR YOUR

01:46:39.693 --> 01:46:41.394
VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU

01:46:41.461 --> 01:46:42.896
SENATOR, AGAIN, THIS BILL HAS

01:46:42.963 --> 01:46:44.698
BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED. MADAM

THANK YOU. I WILL ASK.

DO I HAVE TO PUBLICLY SAY IT?

01:47:38.351 --> 01:47:41.321
OUR VICE CHAIR, MR. ALANIZ, IS

01:47:41.388 --> 01:47:43.089
IN THE BUILDING, SO I'M GOING TO

01:47:43.156 --> 01:48:00.173
HAND HIM BACK THE GAVEL.

01:48:15.088 --> 01:48:16.523
SENATOR ASHBY, YOU'LL BE NEXT.

01:48:16.590 --> 01:48:18.592

01:48:18.658 --> 01:48:22.295
SB SIX? SURE. ALL RIGHT. ITEM

01:48:22.362 --> 01:48:22.829

CHAIRMAN AND COLLEAGUES. I KNOW

01:48:30.270 --> 01:48:33.006
YOU GUYS HAVE A BUSY SCHEDULE. I

01:48:33.073 --> 01:48:37.410
WILL TRY TO HELP MOVE THIS ALONG

01:48:37.477 --> 01:48:43.683
QUICKLY. GOOD MORNING. HI.

01:48:43.750 --> 01:48:49.890
THANKS FOR BEING HERE. SURE. ALL

01:48:49.956 --> 01:48:52.158
RIGHT. LET'S START WITH SB SIX.

01:48:52.225 --> 01:48:54.661
YOU SAID RIGHT HERE TO PRESENT

01:48:54.728 --> 01:48:56.329
THIS BILL, WHICH WOULD SCHEDULE

01:48:56.396 --> 01:48:57.864
XYLAZINE AS A CONTROLLED

01:48:57.931 --> 01:48:59.766
SUBSTANCE IN CALIFORNIA,

01:48:59.833 --> 01:49:01.368
PREVENTING ITS ILLICIT USE WHILE

01:49:01.434 --> 01:49:02.535
CREATING GUARDRAILS FOR THE

01:49:02.602 --> 01:49:04.271
DRUG'S CONTINUED USE Ã

01:49:04.337 --> 01:49:07.941
VETERINARY MEDICINE. XYLAZINE IS

01:49:08.008 --> 01:49:10.010
REFERRED TO SOMETIMES AS TRANQ

01:49:10.076 --> 01:49:11.978
OR THE ZOMBIE DRUG. IT'S CALLED

01:49:12.045 --> 01:49:14.714
THE ZOMBIE DRUG BECAUSE IT

01:49:14.781 --> 01:49:17.317
RENDERS ITS USER UNABLE TO STAND

01:49:17.384 --> 01:49:20.020
UPRIGHT AND CAUSES GAPING WOUNDS

01:49:20.086 --> 01:49:23.757
THAT LOOK A LOT LIKE A ZOMBIE.

01:49:23.823 --> 01:49:28.128
XYLAZINE. HAS TRIPLED THE EFFECT

01:49:28.194 --> 01:49:30.931
OF DEATHS IN OUR REGION.

01:49:30.997 --> 01:49:32.432
INTERESTINGLY, THIS BILL A YEAR

01:49:32.499 --> 01:49:34.134
AGO WASN'T QUITE. IT WAS

01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:35.936
PREVENTATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA, AND

01:49:36.002 --> 01:49:38.405
NOW IT IS NO LONGER PREVENTATIVE

01:49:38.471 --> 01:49:40.707
FOR CALIFORNIA BECAUSE XYLAZINE

01:49:40.774 --> 01:49:43.476
IS PRETTY PREDOMINANT HERE AS

01:49:43.543 --> 01:49:46.112
WELL. XYLAZINE MIXED WITH

01:49:46.179 --> 01:49:47.814
FENTANYL IS ONE OF THE CURRENT

01:49:47.881 --> 01:49:49.749
DRUG COCKTAILS OF CHOICE ACROSS

01:49:49.816 --> 01:49:52.919
OUR COUNTRY RIGHT NOW.

01:49:52.986 --> 01:49:54.688
PROBLEMATICALLY, XYLAZINE IS

01:49:54.754 --> 01:49:56.523
IMPERVIOUS TO NARCAN, UNLIKE

01:49:56.589 --> 01:49:58.591
OTHER OPIOIDS, WHICH MAKES IT

01:49:58.658 --> 01:50:00.894
REALLY DIFFICULT IN AN EMERGENCY

01:50:00.961 --> 01:50:04.064
SITUATION FOR FOLKS TO SAVE AN

01:50:04.130 --> 01:50:06.633
INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS CONSUMED

01:50:06.700 --> 01:50:09.436
XYLAZINE. THIS BILL MAKES

01:50:09.502 --> 01:50:11.171
XYLAZINE A SCHEDULE THREE DRUG.

01:50:11.237 --> 01:50:13.440
IT'S THE LOWEST LEVEL WE CAN DO,

01:50:13.506 --> 01:50:14.908
BUT WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

01:50:14.975 --> 01:50:16.710
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT'S VERY EASY

01:50:16.776 --> 01:50:19.279
TO GET $6, $20. YOU CAN GET IT

01:50:19.346 --> 01:50:21.982
ONLINE, AND THAT'S BECAUSE

01:50:22.048 --> 01:50:23.550
XYLAZINE DOES HAVE AN IMPORTANT

01:50:23.616 --> 01:50:25.352
PURPOSE. BUT THE IMPORTANT

01:50:25.418 --> 01:50:27.520
PURPOSE IS TO SERVE LARGE

01:50:27.587 --> 01:50:30.056
ANIMALS, VERY, VERY LARGE

01:50:30.123 --> 01:50:31.858
ANIMALS. IT'S A SEDATIVE FOR

01:50:31.925 --> 01:50:33.360
THOSE CREATURES. AND YOU'LL HEAR

01:50:33.426 --> 01:50:34.694
A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT

01:50:34.761 --> 01:50:37.664
FROM ONE OF MY WITNESSES TO

01:50:37.731 --> 01:50:41.134
TODAY. THIS THIS BILL WAS PART

01:50:41.201 --> 01:50:43.636
OF THE SAFER CALIFORNIA SENATE

01:50:43.703 --> 01:50:45.138
PACKAGE LAST YEAR, AND IS ONE

01:50:45.205 --> 01:50:47.040
THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS CALLED FOR

01:50:47.107 --> 01:50:48.875
A NUMBER OF TIMES. I'M PROUD TO

01:50:48.942 --> 01:50:50.844
BE BACK IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY

01:50:50.910 --> 01:50:51.711
AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK

01:50:51.778 --> 01:50:53.980
ABOUT THE BILL AND SEE IF WE CAN

01:50:54.047 --> 01:50:56.583
MOVE IT FORWARD. I THINK IT'S

01:50:56.649 --> 01:50:58.451
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE USE

01:50:58.518 --> 01:51:00.820
EVERY TOOL WE CAN. YOU GUYS KNOW

01:51:00.887 --> 01:51:03.223
THIS. YOUR LEGISLATORS, NO ONE

01:51:03.289 --> 01:51:05.291
BILL WILL SOLVE ALL OF OUR

01:51:05.358 --> 01:51:07.394
PROBLEMS. BUT HOPEFULLY AS WE

01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:09.596
WEAVE TOGETHER ALL OF OUR IDEAS

01:51:09.662 --> 01:51:11.498
AND ALL OF OUR WORK, WE CAN

01:51:11.564 --> 01:51:13.366
REALLY START TO GET AT THE ROOT

01:51:13.433 --> 01:51:14.734
OF THINGS. THERE IS NO PART OF

01:51:14.801 --> 01:51:17.504
ME THAT BELIEVES THAT SB SIX

01:51:17.570 --> 01:51:21.207
WILL SOLVE THE OPIOID CRISIS, OR

01:51:21.274 --> 01:51:23.343
THE DEATHS OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN

01:51:23.410 --> 01:51:23.977
OUR COMMUNITIES. YOU WILL HEAR

01:51:24.044 --> 01:51:25.912
TRAGICALLY ABOUT AS WELL, BUT IT

01:51:25.979 --> 01:51:27.914
IS MY HOPE THAT THIS BILL,

01:51:27.981 --> 01:51:29.115
COUPLED WITH THINGS THAT YOU ARE

01:51:29.182 --> 01:51:31.117
ALL DOING AND WE ARE DOING IN

01:51:31.184 --> 01:51:32.952
THE SENATE TO ON BEHAVIORAL

01:51:33.019 --> 01:51:34.788
HEALTH, ON OUTREACH, ON

01:51:34.854 --> 01:51:36.589
ADDICTION AND HOMELESS SERVICES

01:51:36.656 --> 01:51:38.058
AND OUTREACH TO YOUNG PEOPLE,

01:51:38.124 --> 01:51:39.959
THAT ALL OF THOSE THINGS

01:51:40.026 --> 01:51:41.728
COMBINED WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE

01:51:41.795 --> 01:51:42.862
FOR THE BETTERMENT OF THE LIVES

01:51:42.929 --> 01:51:45.098
OF PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF

01:51:45.165 --> 01:51:46.299
CALIFORNIA. WITH ME TODAY AND

01:52:39.052 --> 01:52:42.088
THAT SB SIX IS A VERY AGGRESSIVE

01:52:42.155 --> 01:52:43.356
MEASURE TO MOVE CALIFORNIA IN

01:52:43.423 --> 01:52:47.460
THE RIGHT DIRECTION, TO PROTECT

01:52:47.527 --> 01:52:49.796
OUR COMMUNITY FROM XYLAZINE

01:52:49.863 --> 01:52:51.498
DIVERSION, BUT BALANCING THE

01:52:51.564 --> 01:52:52.999
IMPORTANT ACCESS TO THE DRUG

01:52:53.066 --> 01:52:54.167
THAT WE NEED AS VETERINARIANS.

01:52:54.234 --> 01:52:56.169
SO, AS SENATOR ASHBY MENTIONED,

01:52:56.236 --> 01:52:58.104
THIS DRUG REALLY HAS A SOLE

01:52:58.171 --> 01:53:00.540
PURPOSE OF SEDATING ANIMALS THAT

01:53:00.607 --> 01:53:03.143
WEIGH THOUSANDS OF POUNDS. I CAN

01:53:03.209 --> 01:53:05.011
TAKE ONE SMALL CC OF THE DRUG,

01:53:05.078 --> 01:53:06.713
WHICH IS LIKE ONE MILLILITER. IT

01:53:06.779 --> 01:53:07.714
WOULD BE ESSENTIALLY LIKE IF YOU

01:53:07.780 --> 01:53:10.316
JUST DUMPED YOUR CUP INTO YOUR

01:53:10.383 --> 01:53:10.984
HAND, ONE LITTLE DROP AND I CAN

01:53:11.050 --> 01:53:13.887
TAKE A HORSE DOWN TO ITS HEAD TO

01:53:13.953 --> 01:53:15.455
THE GROUND. WITHIN ABOUT TWO

01:53:15.522 --> 01:53:17.757
MINUTES OF GIVING THIS DRUG. I

01:53:17.824 --> 01:53:18.992
COMMONLY USE IT, ACTUALLY, IT'S

01:53:19.058 --> 01:53:21.361
PROBABLY ONE OF THE TOP 5 OR 6

01:53:21.427 --> 01:53:24.297
DRUGS I USE ON A ROUTINE BASIS

01:53:24.364 --> 01:53:24.898
TO PROVIDE REALLY PREDICTABLE

01:53:24.964 --> 01:53:26.399
AND RELIABLE SEDATION TO MY

01:53:26.466 --> 01:53:29.335
ANIMALS, TO MY PATIENTS, AND I

01:53:29.402 --> 01:53:31.037
USE IT OFTENTIMES IF I'M

01:53:31.104 --> 01:53:33.373
SUTURING A WOUND THAT I NEED TO

01:53:33.439 --> 01:53:35.108
NUMB AND CLEAN, OR IF I'M DOING

01:53:35.175 --> 01:53:36.876
DENTAL WORK ON THEM, THEY DON'T

01:53:36.943 --> 01:53:37.844
VOLUNTARILY OPEN THEIR MOUTHS

01:53:37.911 --> 01:53:40.813
FOR US. AND SO THIS DRUG REALLY

01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:43.550
RENDERS THEM BASICALLY

01:53:43.616 --> 01:53:44.517
INCAPACITATED. IT PROVIDES

01:53:44.584 --> 01:53:46.219
INCREDIBLE PAIN CONTROL AND

01:53:46.286 --> 01:53:48.388
REALLY PREDICTABLE SEDATION. BUT

01:53:48.454 --> 01:53:49.756
AGAIN, IT'S AN EXTREMELY

01:53:49.822 --> 01:53:52.692
POWERFUL DRUG AND REALLY MEANT

01:53:52.759 --> 01:53:55.461
TO BE USED IN, IN LIVESTOCK, IN,

01:53:55.528 --> 01:53:59.199
IN, IN HORSES AND IN SOME

01:53:59.265 --> 01:54:00.567
INSTANCES FOR ANIMAL CONTROL

01:54:00.633 --> 01:54:03.069
OFFICERS TO SUBDUE A WILD ANIMAL

01:54:03.136 --> 01:54:04.871
THROUGH TRANQUILIZATION IN THE

01:54:04.938 --> 01:54:11.744
FIELD. SO. I AM VERY

01:54:11.811 --> 01:54:12.545
APPRECIATIVE OF YOUR

01:54:12.612 --> 01:54:13.880
CONSIDERATION OF THIS BILL. WE,

01:54:13.947 --> 01:54:15.715
THE VETERINARIANS, FEEL THAT WE

01:54:15.782 --> 01:54:17.083
CAN PUT THIS DRUG UNDER LOCK AND

01:54:17.150 --> 01:54:19.352
KEY WITH WITH GREAT EASE. WE

01:54:19.419 --> 01:54:20.153
ALREADY HAVE CONTROLLED DRUG

01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:21.354
PROTOCOLS THAT WE USE FOR OTHER

01:54:21.421 --> 01:54:23.423
DRUGS, AND THIS WOULD BE ONE

01:54:23.489 --> 01:54:23.990
THAT WE, AS THE PROFESSION,

01:54:24.057 --> 01:54:26.125
WOULD BE HAPPY TO JOIN THE LIFT

01:54:26.192 --> 01:54:28.261
IN KEEPING IT UNDER BETTER

01:54:28.328 --> 01:54:30.163
CONTROL AND TRYING TO HELP AVOID

01:54:30.230 --> 01:54:32.031
ANY DIVERSION. SO I REALLY THANK

01:54:32.098 --> 01:54:33.700
YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND

01:54:33.766 --> 01:54:35.802
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

01:54:35.868 --> 01:54:39.472
THANK YOU. HELLO, MY NAME IS

01:54:39.539 --> 01:54:43.376
MARIKA COLE AND I BELIEVE THAT

01:54:43.443 --> 01:54:48.281
XYLAZINE SHOULD BE RESTRICTED TO

01:54:48.348 --> 01:54:51.017
THE ACCESS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC

01:54:51.084 --> 01:54:53.152
BY BUYING THIS ONLINE. IT MAKES

01:54:53.219 --> 01:54:55.121
IT VERY, VERY DANGEROUS FOR

01:54:55.188 --> 01:54:57.857
PEOPLE LIKE MY SON WHO WAS

01:54:57.924 --> 01:55:00.994
AUTISTIC AND CONSERVED, THAT WAS

01:55:01.060 --> 01:55:05.098
KILLED BY CARFENTANYL, WHICH IS

01:55:05.164 --> 01:55:06.766
ANOTHER LARGE ANIMAL

01:55:06.833 --> 01:55:09.002
TRANQUILIZER THAT IS NOT

01:55:09.068 --> 01:55:12.705
RESTRICTED TO THE PUBLIC. SO ONE

01:55:12.772 --> 01:55:14.440
OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE FINDING

01:55:14.507 --> 01:55:20.880
IS THAT BY CUTTING THIS INTO

01:55:20.947 --> 01:55:25.184
FENTANYL, XYLAZINE IS CHEAP.

01:55:25.251 --> 01:55:28.087
IT'S A WAY FOR PEOPLE TO PUT

01:55:28.154 --> 01:55:30.256
PROFIT OVER HUMAN BEINGS. AND

01:55:30.323 --> 01:55:31.624
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE

01:55:31.691 --> 01:55:33.326
STREETS. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

01:55:33.393 --> 01:55:35.395
BEING AFFECTED BY IT AND DYING

01:55:35.461 --> 01:55:38.631
BY IT, AND THE CHAOS ON THE

01:55:38.698 --> 01:55:40.400
STREETS HAVE TO STOP. THE

01:55:40.466 --> 01:55:43.169
RESTRICTION MUST HAPPEN BECAUSE

01:55:43.236 --> 01:55:45.538
WITHOUT THAT, THERE ARE GOING TO

01:55:45.605 --> 01:55:49.642
BE MORE DEATHS. SO WE KNOW THAT

01:55:49.709 --> 01:55:51.477
IT'S EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. YOU

01:55:51.544 --> 01:55:54.614
CAN GO DOWN IN SAN FRANCISCO,

01:55:54.681 --> 01:55:56.983
SACRAMENTO, LOS ANGELES,

01:55:57.050 --> 01:55:58.718
WHEREVER, AND YOU WILL SEE

01:55:58.785 --> 01:56:01.921
PEOPLE IN A ZOMBIE LIKE STATE.

01:56:01.988 --> 01:56:04.724
AND THAT'S HOW DANGEROUS IT IS.

01:56:04.791 --> 01:56:06.292
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS

01:56:06.359 --> 01:56:08.061
THEY'RE GETTING. SOME OF THEM

01:56:08.127 --> 01:56:11.564
JUST WANT IT'S HIGHLY ADDICTIVE.

01:56:11.631 --> 01:56:14.100
SO THEY'RE LOOKING FOR

01:56:14.167 --> 01:56:16.336
SOMETHING, BUT NOBODY DESERVES

01:56:16.402 --> 01:56:18.838
TO DIE. NOBODY DESERVES TO BE

01:56:18.905 --> 01:56:20.740
INTRODUCED TO SOMETHING THAT'S

01:56:20.807 --> 01:56:24.877
HIGHLY ILLEGAL. ILLEGAL, BUT IS

01:56:24.944 --> 01:56:26.479
FOR MEDICINAL USE FOR

01:56:26.546 --> 01:56:29.115
VETERINARIANS. IT NEEDS TO BE

01:56:29.182 --> 01:56:33.386
RESTRICTED. IT REALLY DOES. AND

01:56:33.453 --> 01:56:36.155
A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT BY

01:56:36.222 --> 01:56:41.661
SCHEDULING THESE TYPES OF.

01:56:41.728 --> 01:56:45.898
CHEMICALS AND THESE DRUGS, THE

01:56:45.965 --> 01:56:48.368
GOAL ISN'T TO INCARCERATE THE

01:56:48.434 --> 01:56:50.937
PEOPLE THAT ARE USING IT. THIS

01:56:51.003 --> 01:56:54.874
IS OUR INCARCERATING POSSIBLE

01:56:54.941 --> 01:56:56.242
INCARCERATION FOR PEOPLE WHO

01:56:56.309 --> 01:56:58.010
ALREADY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE

01:56:58.077 --> 01:57:01.013
COURT SYSTEM TO JUSTIFY WHY THEY

01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:03.616
HAD IT AND WHY THEY'RE PEDDLING

01:57:03.683 --> 01:57:07.019
IT, AND WHY THEY'RE USING IT,

01:57:07.086 --> 01:57:08.588
WHAT THEY'RE USING IT FOR, WHY

01:57:08.654 --> 01:57:12.558
THEY ORDERED IT. 10S. SO IT

01:57:12.625 --> 01:57:14.327
GIVES LAW ENFORCEMENT THE TOOLS

01:57:14.394 --> 01:57:16.462
TO, TO STOP THE DRUG

01:57:16.529 --> 01:57:18.965
TRAFFICKING. IT REALLY DOES BY

01:57:19.031 --> 01:57:22.602
SCHEDULING THIS, BY SCHEDULING.

01:57:22.668 --> 01:57:25.905

RESPECTFULLY OPPOSES THIS BILL.

01:59:09.575 --> 01:59:11.277
WE ALL WANT OUR LOVED ONES AND

01:59:11.344 --> 01:59:13.079
COMMUNITIES TO BE SAFE. AND WE

01:59:13.145 --> 01:59:13.746
CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE INTENT

01:59:13.813 --> 01:59:15.982
OF THIS LEGISLATION IN

01:59:16.048 --> 01:59:17.183
ATTEMPTING TO REDUCE OVERDOSE

01:59:17.250 --> 01:59:19.585
DEATHS AND REDUCE SUFFERING. BUT

01:59:19.652 --> 01:59:21.087
ADDING NEW SUBSTANCES TO THE

01:59:21.153 --> 01:59:21.721
CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT, AND

01:59:21.787 --> 01:59:23.022
THUS CRIMINALIZING MORE

01:59:23.089 --> 01:59:24.657
SUBSTANCES DOES NOT HELP WITH

01:59:24.724 --> 01:59:26.692
THAT. WHAT IT DOES IS ADD MORE

01:59:26.759 --> 01:59:28.094
WAYS TO CHARGE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:29.095
ALREADY BEEN STRUGGLING WITH

01:59:29.161 --> 01:59:31.163
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. IT WILL

01:59:31.230 --> 01:59:33.099
LEAD TO ARBITRARY, HEIGHTENED

01:59:33.165 --> 01:59:34.000
CRIMINALIZATION AND SENTENCING

01:59:34.066 --> 01:59:35.635
OF PEOPLE WHO USE DRUGS WITHOUT

01:59:35.701 --> 01:59:37.236
REDUCING THE PRESENCE OF

01:59:37.303 --> 01:59:38.604
XYLAZINE IN THE ILLICIT DRUG

01:59:38.671 --> 01:59:41.040
SUPPLY. WE KNOW THAT THIS WILL

01:59:41.107 --> 01:59:42.208
FALL ON PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY

01:59:42.275 --> 01:59:43.209
SUFFERING THE MOST FROM

01:59:43.276 --> 01:59:45.144
ADDICTION AND POVERTY, MOST OF

01:59:45.211 --> 01:59:47.213
WHOM DO NOT INTEND, AS WAS

01:59:47.280 --> 01:59:49.782
STATED PREVIOUSLY, TO POSSESS

01:59:49.849 --> 01:59:51.484
XYLAZINE AND OFTEN DO NOT HAVE

01:59:51.551 --> 01:59:53.019
INFORMATION ABOUT THE SPECIFIC

01:59:53.085 --> 01:59:54.420
CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF

01:59:54.487 --> 01:59:56.489
SUBSTANCES THAT THEY POSSESS OR

01:59:56.556 --> 01:59:59.091
CONSUME. SIMILAR EFFORTS TO

01:59:59.158 --> 02:00:00.560
SCHEDULE MORE ANALOGS OF

02:00:00.626 --> 02:00:02.562
FENTANYL HAVE ONLY LED TO THE

02:00:02.628 --> 02:00:04.063
PRESENCE OF MORE AND

02:00:04.130 --> 02:00:04.664
INCREASINGLY MORE SUBSTANCES,

02:00:04.730 --> 02:00:07.066
MORE POTENT SUBSTANCES, AND HAVE

02:00:07.133 --> 02:00:08.834
SHOWN NO BENEFIT IN REDUCING THE

02:00:08.901 --> 02:00:10.603
PRESENCE OF FENTANYL AND SIMILAR

02:00:10.670 --> 02:00:12.471
COMPOUNDS IN THE DRUG SUPPLY.

02:00:12.538 --> 02:00:13.406
WE'VE ALREADY SEEN SIMILAR

02:00:13.472 --> 02:00:14.574
OUTCOMES IN STATES THAT HAVE

02:00:14.640 --> 02:00:16.342
MOVED FORWARD ON SCHEDULING.

02:00:16.409 --> 02:00:17.777
XYLAZINE FLORIDA, WHICH ADDED

02:00:17.843 --> 02:00:20.346
XYLAZINE TO SCHEDULE 1 IN 2018,

02:00:20.413 --> 02:00:22.548
EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN THE

02:00:22.615 --> 02:00:23.616
PREVALENCE OF XYLAZINE IN THE

02:00:23.683 --> 02:00:25.751
DRUG SUPPLY AND A DOUBLING OF

02:00:25.818 --> 02:00:26.719
OVERDOSE FATALITIES OVER THE

02:00:26.786 --> 02:00:28.588
NEXT FIVE YEARS. WE'VE ALSO

02:00:28.654 --> 02:00:29.655
HEARD FROM ACADEMIC AND

02:00:29.722 --> 02:00:31.090
ADDICTION MEDICINE EXPERTS

02:00:31.157 --> 02:00:32.592
NATIONWIDE WHO HAVE CAUTIONED

02:00:32.658 --> 02:00:34.327
AGAINST SCHEDULING XYLAZINE, AND

02:00:34.393 --> 02:00:35.895
INDICATED THAT IT WILL

02:00:35.962 --> 02:00:37.496
COMPLICATE THE RESEARCH PROCESS

02:00:37.563 --> 02:00:38.798
AT A TIME THAT WE NEED MORE

02:00:38.864 --> 02:00:40.232
EXTENSIVE RESEARCH ON THE DRUG

02:00:40.299 --> 02:00:42.902
AND ITS IMPACTS. IN DECEMBER

02:00:42.969 --> 02:00:44.770
2023, OVER 150 EXPERTS SENT A

02:00:44.837 --> 02:00:46.739
LETTER TO CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS

02:00:46.806 --> 02:00:48.441
WARNING THAT CRIMINALIZING

02:00:48.507 --> 02:00:49.809
XYLAZINE WOULD DISRUPT NEEDED

02:00:49.875 --> 02:00:51.644
RESEARCH AND POTENTIALLY IMPACT

02:00:51.711 --> 02:00:53.713
MEDICAL PRACTICES. AND I WOULD

02:00:53.779 --> 02:00:55.581
NOTE THAT CONGRESS STILL HAS NOT

02:00:55.648 --> 02:00:57.416
MOVED FORWARD ON SCHEDULING

02:00:57.483 --> 02:00:58.517
XYLAZINE. THERE'S JUST NO

02:00:58.584 --> 02:00:59.552
EVIDENCE THAT PLACING THIS

02:00:59.619 --> 02:01:01.287
SUBSTANCE ON THE CSA WILL LEAD

02:01:01.354 --> 02:01:03.055
TO ANY SCIENTIFICALLY OBSERVABLE

02:01:03.122 --> 02:01:05.391
BENEFITS. THERE'S NO SCIENTIFIC

02:01:05.458 --> 02:01:06.759
PROCESS UNDERPINNING THIS

02:01:06.826 --> 02:01:07.960
CONCLUSION THAT XYLAZINE SHOULD

02:01:08.027 --> 02:01:09.662
BE INCLUDED IN THIS MANNER.

02:01:09.729 --> 02:01:11.163
MANNER AND SCHEDULING SHOULD BE

02:01:11.230 --> 02:01:13.933
BASED ON A SCIENTIFIC PROCESS.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:15.101
WE HAVE SOLUTIONS TO THESE

02:01:15.167 --> 02:01:16.569
PROBLEMS THAT INCREASE ACCESS TO

02:01:16.636 --> 02:01:18.704
CARE AND MAINTAIN PUBLIC SAFETY.

02:01:18.771 --> 02:01:19.939
INCREASING ACCESS TO COMMUNITY

02:01:20.006 --> 02:01:22.041
BASED DRUG CHECKING SERVICES,

02:01:22.108 --> 02:01:23.643
EXPANDING NALOXONE DISTRIBUTION,

02:01:23.709 --> 02:01:25.111
BUILDING A NETWORK OF PEER

02:01:25.177 --> 02:01:26.545
OUTREACH AND STREET MEDICINE

02:01:26.612 --> 02:01:28.414
SERVICES. IMPROVING ACCESS TO

02:01:28.481 --> 02:01:29.515
MEDICATION TREATMENT, AND

02:01:29.582 --> 02:01:32.051
BROADENING GOOD SAMARITAN LAWS

02:01:32.118 --> 02:01:33.519
CAN ALL PREVENT DEATHS AND

02:01:33.586 --> 02:01:35.321
INCREASE ACCESS TO SERVICES AND

02:01:35.388 --> 02:01:37.123
CONNECTIONS. EVIDENCE BASED

02:01:37.189 --> 02:01:38.324
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER

02:01:38.391 --> 02:01:39.158
TREATMENT. WE NEED TO INVEST IN

02:01:39.225 --> 02:01:41.027
THOSE HEALTH CENTERED SOLUTIONS,

02:01:41.093 --> 02:01:42.895
AND INSTEAD OF ADDING THE

02:01:42.962 --> 02:01:44.263
SUBSTANCE IN THIS MANNER, EVEN

02:01:44.330 --> 02:01:45.598
BEFORE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

02:01:45.665 --> 02:01:47.199
HAS MOVED TO ADD IT. SO FOR ALL

02:01:47.266 --> 02:01:49.502
THESE REASONS, WE RESPECTFULLY

02:01:49.568 --> 02:01:50.269
URGE YOUR OPPOSITION TO THIS

02:01:50.336 --> 02:01:53.005
BILL. ALL RIGHT, CHAIR AND

02:01:53.072 --> 02:01:54.040
MEMBERS, MY NAME IS AUBREY

02:01:54.106 --> 02:01:55.074
RODRIGUEZ, AND I'M A LEGISLATIVE

02:01:55.141 --> 02:01:56.876
ADVOCATE WITH ACLU CALIFORNIA

02:01:56.942 --> 02:01:58.611
ACTION. WE ARE IN STRONG

02:01:58.678 --> 02:02:00.179
OPPOSITION TO SB SIX, WHICH

02:02:00.246 --> 02:02:02.281
WOULD BREATHE NEW LIFE INTO

02:02:02.348 --> 02:02:03.749
CALIFORNIA'S FAILED WAR ON DRUGS

02:02:03.816 --> 02:02:05.251
BY ADDRESSING A PUBLIC HEALTH

02:02:05.317 --> 02:02:07.019
CRISIS THROUGH CRIMINALIZATION.

02:02:07.086 --> 02:02:08.854
JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, JUNE

02:02:08.921 --> 02:02:11.891
17TH, 2025 MARKED THE 54TH

02:02:11.957 --> 02:02:13.125
ANNIVERSARY OF THE INFAMOUS WAR

02:02:13.192 --> 02:02:16.028
ON DRUGS ENDEAVORED BY RICHARD

02:02:16.095 --> 02:02:18.197
NIXON. IT'S ONE OF OUR MOST

02:02:18.264 --> 02:02:20.199
RACIST AND EXPENSIVE POLICIES OF

02:02:20.266 --> 02:02:23.169
THE 20TH CENTURY. THE ACLU HAS

02:02:23.235 --> 02:02:24.303
CONSISTENTLY MAINTAINED THAT

02:02:24.370 --> 02:02:25.337
ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS THE PUBLIC

02:02:25.404 --> 02:02:26.772
HEALTH PROBLEM OF DRUG ABUSE

02:02:26.839 --> 02:02:29.275
THROUGH CRIMINAL LAW ARE

02:02:29.341 --> 02:02:30.743
INAPPROPRIATE AND EFFECTIVE,

02:02:30.810 --> 02:02:32.578
COSTLY, AND LEADS TO WIDESPREAD

02:02:32.645 --> 02:02:34.046
VIOLATIONS OF PRIVACY AND OTHER

02:02:34.113 --> 02:02:36.449
CIVIL LIBERTIES. ONE OF THE

02:02:36.515 --> 02:02:37.750
IRONIES WITH THIS PROPOSAL IS

02:02:37.817 --> 02:02:39.085
THAT OUR EXISTING DRUG

02:02:39.151 --> 02:02:40.786
PROHIBITION IS LARGELY TO THANK

02:02:40.853 --> 02:02:41.954
FOR XYLAZINE INCREASING PART OF

02:02:42.021 --> 02:02:44.523
OUR DRUG SUPPLY, RESTRICTING

02:02:44.590 --> 02:02:45.825
PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS DID NOT END

02:02:45.891 --> 02:02:47.693
DEMAND FOR THOSE THESE OPIOIDS.

02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:48.894
INSTEAD, IT JUST SENT PEOPLE TO

02:02:48.961 --> 02:02:51.297
THE UNDERGROUND HEROIN SUPPLY.

02:02:51.363 --> 02:02:52.698
CRACKDOWNS ON HEROIN LED

02:02:52.765 --> 02:02:54.133
SUPPLIERS TO PRODUCE CHEAPER,

02:02:54.200 --> 02:02:55.901
POTENT AND EASILY SMUGGLED

02:02:55.968 --> 02:02:58.437
FENTANYL. FENTANYL PENALTIES

02:02:58.504 --> 02:02:59.572
INCENTIVIZE FENTANYL ANALOGS TO

02:02:59.638 --> 02:03:03.109
FLOOD OUR MARKETS WHEN WE TRY TO

02:03:03.175 --> 02:03:04.210
ERADICATE ONE DRUG, A NEW

02:03:04.276 --> 02:03:05.778
SUBSTANCE WILL EMERGE, AND OFTEN

02:03:05.845 --> 02:03:07.413
IT IS A DRUG THAT HAS

02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:08.547
UNPREDICTABLE EFFECTS. SINCE

02:03:08.614 --> 02:03:10.015
MANY USERS ARE NOT AWARE OF WHAT

02:03:10.082 --> 02:03:13.119
THEY ARE OR HOW STRONG IT IS.

02:03:13.185 --> 02:03:14.286
AND NOW HISTORY IS ONCE AGAIN

02:03:14.353 --> 02:03:16.756
REPEATING ITSELF. THEY STEAL

02:03:16.822 --> 02:03:18.157
YOUR EMPLOYER'S EVERY

02:03:18.224 --> 02:03:19.792
POLICYMAKER IN THIS ROOM TO

02:03:19.859 --> 02:03:21.727
LEARN FROM OUR PAST MISTAKES,

02:03:21.794 --> 02:03:23.195
AND TO INSTEAD MOVE AWAY FROM AN

02:03:23.262 --> 02:03:25.698
OVERLY PUNITIVE SYSTEM. WE MUST

02:03:25.765 --> 02:03:27.233
LEARN FROM THESE FAILED POLICIES

02:03:27.299 --> 02:03:29.135
AND CHANGE OUR APPROACH, AS WE

02:03:29.201 --> 02:03:31.670
HAVE OVER HALF A CENTURY OF DATA

02:03:31.737 --> 02:03:33.339
THAT CLEARLY SHOWS POLICING

02:03:33.405 --> 02:03:34.874
PEOPLE'S BEHAVIOR WHEN

02:03:34.940 --> 02:03:37.042
CONCERNING THESE SUBSTANCES ONLY

02:03:37.109 --> 02:03:38.410
EXACERBATES THE ISSUE PURPORTS

02:03:38.477 --> 02:03:41.180
TO RESOLVE. FOR THESE REASONS,

02:03:41.247 --> 02:03:43.149
WE URGE YOUR NO VOTE AND ARE IN

02:03:43.215 --> 02:03:44.450
STRONG OPPOSITION TO SB SIX.

02:03:44.517 --> 02:03:46.385
THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

02:03:46.452 --> 02:03:48.220
ANYONE ELSE ON THE PUBLIC

02:03:48.287 --> 02:03:49.688
OPPOSITION NAME, ORGANIZATION

02:03:49.755 --> 02:03:52.057
POSITION? PLEASE STAND ON BEHALF

02:03:52.124 --> 02:03:55.060
OF LAW, DEFENSE AND INITIATE

02:03:55.127 --> 02:04:04.503
JUSTICE IN OPPOSITION. KIÂ¾M ON

02:04:04.570 --> 02:04:05.571
BEHALF OF ANTI POLICE TERROR

02:04:05.638 --> 02:04:08.274
PROJECT AND STRONG OPPOSITION.

02:04:08.340 --> 02:04:17.316
THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE? DANIELLA

02:04:17.383 --> 02:04:19.585
DEAN ON BEHALF OF LEGAL SERVICES

02:04:19.652 --> 02:04:21.153
FOR PRISONERS OF CHILDREN AND

02:04:21.220 --> 02:04:24.089
ALL OF US ARE NONE OPPOSED.

02:04:24.156 --> 02:04:26.125
MELISSA MOORE. FOR LEGAL

02:04:26.192 --> 02:04:26.892
SERVICES FOR PRISONERS WITH

02:04:26.959 --> 02:04:29.395
CHILDREN. OPPOSE. THANK YOU.

02:04:29.461 --> 02:04:31.096
WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO

02:04:31.163 --> 02:04:32.998
COMMITTEE. COMMITTEE? ANY

02:04:33.065 --> 02:04:36.869
COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS? YES. I

02:04:36.936 --> 02:04:40.673
DON'T HAVE A VOICE REALLY I DO,

02:04:40.739 --> 02:04:43.409
AND I DON'T HAVE A VOICE. THE

02:04:43.475 --> 02:04:46.145
VOICE IS NOT. HAVE A COMMENT.

02:04:46.212 --> 02:04:51.851
I'LL TRY MY BEST. I HAVE TO SAY

02:04:51.917 --> 02:04:53.552
THAT THIS IS THIS IS HARD FOR

02:04:53.619 --> 02:04:57.423
ME. IT'S HARD FOR ME TO REALLY

02:04:57.489 --> 02:04:59.592
DECIDE WHICH WAY I WANT TO GO ON

02:04:59.658 --> 02:05:01.527
THIS, BECAUSE I DO AGREE WITH

02:05:01.594 --> 02:05:03.996
OPPOSITION WHEN IT COMES TO THE

02:05:04.063 --> 02:05:05.698
OVER PUNITIVE PROCESS OF THIS

02:05:05.764 --> 02:05:08.234
AND CRIMINALIZING FOLKS THAT

02:05:08.300 --> 02:05:10.669
LOOK LIKE ME AND SO MANY OTHERS,

02:05:10.736 --> 02:05:12.972
THE IMPACT THAT IT WILL HAVE ON

02:05:13.038 --> 02:05:14.773
BARRIERS TO RESEARCH, AS WE

02:05:14.840 --> 02:05:15.941
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RESEARCH

02:05:16.008 --> 02:05:17.643
REALLY IS AS IT PERTAINS TO

02:05:17.710 --> 02:05:19.745
HUMANS AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME.

02:05:19.812 --> 02:05:24.250
AND SO I GUESS FOR ME, IN LIGHT

02:05:24.316 --> 02:05:26.318
OF WHAT WAS PASSED WITH PROP 36

02:05:26.385 --> 02:05:28.754
AND THE PROMISES THAT WAS MADE

02:05:28.821 --> 02:05:30.089
FOR PROGRAMS AND SUPPORT

02:05:30.155 --> 02:05:33.359
SERVICES, I DON'T AT THIS POINT,

02:05:33.425 --> 02:05:34.860
FROM WHAT I'M HEARING, I REALLY

02:05:34.927 --> 02:05:37.529
SEE THIS AS A WAY OF INCREASING

02:05:37.596 --> 02:05:39.398
THE POTENTIAL OF MORE FOLKS

02:05:39.465 --> 02:05:40.332
BEING BEING INCARCERATED INSTEAD

02:05:40.399 --> 02:05:43.269
OF DOING TREATMENT. I'M HOPING

02:05:43.335 --> 02:05:45.070
THAT SHOULD THIS BILL CONTINUE

02:05:45.137 --> 02:05:46.438
TO MOVE FORWARD, WE FIGURE OUT

02:05:46.505 --> 02:05:49.008
ANOTHER WAY TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE

02:05:49.074 --> 02:05:50.309
GET THE HELP THAT THEY NEED.

02:05:50.376 --> 02:05:52.578
PEOPLE WANT HELP. PUTTING THEM

02:05:52.645 --> 02:05:55.381
IN PRISON OR IN JAIL WAS NOT THE

02:05:55.447 --> 02:05:57.583
WAY TO HELP THEM. THIS IN MY

02:05:57.650 --> 02:05:58.817
MIND, JUST JUST FROM WHAT I'M

02:05:58.884 --> 02:06:01.086
HEARING, IT DOESN'T STOP

02:06:01.153 --> 02:06:03.022
OVERDOSES. IT'S NOT GOING TO

02:06:03.088 --> 02:06:05.291
STOP A NUMBER OF THINGS. AND SO

02:06:05.357 --> 02:06:06.292
I'M JUST BEING CANDID WITH ALL

02:06:06.358 --> 02:06:08.027
OF YOU THAT I'M FINDING THIS TO

02:06:08.093 --> 02:06:10.296
BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO MAKE

02:06:10.362 --> 02:06:14.133
A DECISION TODAY BECAUSE OF THE

02:06:14.199 --> 02:06:15.367
FACT THAT ANYONE WHO KNOWS ME,

02:06:15.434 --> 02:06:17.369
I'M NOT A FAN OF CRIMINALIZING

02:06:17.436 --> 02:06:20.339
MY COMMUNITY AT ALL. I DON'T

02:06:20.406 --> 02:06:21.640
KNOW IF THERE'S ANY WAY. I'M

02:06:21.707 --> 02:06:23.509
ASKING THE AUTHOR IF THERE'S ANY

02:06:23.575 --> 02:06:24.777
WAY TO TAKE SOME OF THE

02:06:24.843 --> 02:06:26.111
INFORMATION THAT OPPOSITION IS

02:06:26.178 --> 02:06:27.846
SAYING IN REAL AND REALLY, YOU

02:06:27.913 --> 02:06:28.881
KNOW, UNDERSTANDING THAT IT'S

02:06:28.948 --> 02:06:30.749
GOING TO BE HARD FOR COMMUNITIES

02:06:30.816 --> 02:06:32.351
OF COLOR, BUT NOT JUST COMMUNITY

02:06:32.418 --> 02:06:33.519
COLORS, BUT THOSE THAT HAVE

02:06:33.585 --> 02:06:35.421
ADDICTIONS THERE. THERE'S

02:06:35.487 --> 02:06:36.789
ADDICTION FOR A NUMBER OF

02:06:36.855 --> 02:06:38.657
REASONS. SO WHAT CAN WE DO WITH

02:06:38.724 --> 02:06:40.793
THIS BILL TO GET, I GUESS, TO

02:06:40.859 --> 02:06:42.261
ADD DIFFERENT TYPES OF

02:06:42.328 --> 02:06:44.430
TREATMENTS AND JUST NOT ADDING

02:06:44.496 --> 02:06:47.967
ANOTHER DRUG TO A LIST THAT CAN

02:06:48.033 --> 02:06:50.569
TRULY HURT SO MANY PEOPLE AND

02:06:50.636 --> 02:06:52.004
ACTUALLY MAKE SOME THINGS WORSE.

02:06:52.071 --> 02:06:54.873
WHAT CAN WE DO TO INCLUDE A WAY

02:06:54.940 --> 02:06:56.041
TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION OR SOME

02:06:56.108 --> 02:06:57.910
WAY, SHAPE OR FORM TO GET THIS

02:06:57.977 --> 02:07:00.546
BILL WHERE IT SHOULD BE? WELL, I

02:07:00.612 --> 02:07:02.548
WOULD ARGUE THAT THE BILL IS IN

02:07:02.614 --> 02:07:05.017
A GOOD SPOT, BUT LET ME JUST

02:07:05.084 --> 02:07:06.618
ADDRESS A COUPLE OF THE THINGS I

02:07:06.685 --> 02:07:07.653
THINK THAT YOU'RE REACTING TO

02:07:07.720 --> 02:07:09.655
AND RESPONDING TO. RIGHTFULLY

02:07:09.722 --> 02:07:11.690
SO. FIRST OF ALL, I WASN'T A

02:07:11.757 --> 02:07:13.258
HUGE SUPPORTER OF PROP 36

02:07:13.325 --> 02:07:14.426
EITHER, FOR THE EXACT SAME

02:07:14.493 --> 02:07:16.729
REASONS THAT YOU HAVE

02:07:16.795 --> 02:07:20.399
ILLUSTRATED. THAT BEING SAID.

02:07:20.466 --> 02:07:22.901
RIGHT NOW, THIS DRUG AS

02:07:22.968 --> 02:07:24.269
DESCRIBED BY THE VETERINARIAN

02:07:24.336 --> 02:07:26.905
WHO USES IT ON HORSES, IS NOT

02:07:26.972 --> 02:07:29.441
ILLEGAL AT ALL. IT'S NOT ILLEGAL

02:07:29.508 --> 02:07:31.610
TO SELL. HE COULD SELL IT IF HE

02:07:31.677 --> 02:07:32.911
WANTED TO. ALL OF YOU IN HERE,

02:07:32.978 --> 02:07:35.914
YOU WOULD DIE. BUT HE COULD SELL

02:07:35.981 --> 02:07:38.784
IT TO YOU. SO THE EXAMPLES THAT

02:07:38.851 --> 02:07:40.486
THESE TWO HAVE USED, AND THEY'RE

02:07:40.552 --> 02:07:41.286
BOTH WONDERFUL HUMANS, AND I

02:07:41.353 --> 02:07:43.355
AGREE WITH THEM ON MANY, MANY

02:07:43.422 --> 02:07:44.857
THINGS. BUT THEY BOTH GAVE YOU

02:07:44.923 --> 02:07:46.925
EXAMPLES OF SCHEDULE ONE DRUGS,

02:07:46.992 --> 02:07:49.161
BOTH IN FLORIDA AND THE DRUGS

02:07:49.228 --> 02:07:50.996
THAT THEY TALKED ABOUT. AND I AM

02:07:51.063 --> 02:07:52.865
NOT PROPOSING A SCHEDULE ONE

02:07:52.931 --> 02:07:54.333
DRUG AS THEY BOTH KNOW I'M

02:07:54.400 --> 02:07:56.435
SCHEDULING THREE, WHICH MEANS

02:07:56.502 --> 02:07:58.904
YOU WOULD NOT GO TO PRISON.

02:07:58.971 --> 02:08:00.672
THAT'S SCHEDULE THREE IS THE

02:08:00.739 --> 02:08:02.074
LOWEST RANK. BUT IF WE DON'T

02:08:02.141 --> 02:08:03.942
SCHEDULE IT, IT'S NOT ILLEGAL.

02:08:04.009 --> 02:08:06.345
IT HAS TO BE ILLEGAL. AND HERE'S

02:08:06.412 --> 02:08:08.547
WHAT I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU. I

02:08:08.614 --> 02:08:09.181
WORKED IN THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S

02:08:09.248 --> 02:08:11.450
OFFICE HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY

02:08:11.517 --> 02:08:13.052
WHILE I WAS IN LAW SCHOOL, AND I

02:08:13.118 --> 02:08:14.753
DEALT WITH THESE TYPE OF LOW

02:08:14.820 --> 02:08:16.889
LEVEL OFFENSES ALL THE TIME. AND

02:08:16.955 --> 02:08:18.791
YOU ALL AND THE LEGISLATORS

02:08:18.857 --> 02:08:20.125
BEFORE US HAVE DONE AN

02:08:20.192 --> 02:08:21.026
INCREDIBLE JOB. AND PROBABLY

02:08:21.093 --> 02:08:23.095
YOUR ORGANIZATIONS ADVOCATING

02:08:23.162 --> 02:08:24.763
FOR IT. AND STAFF MEMBERS LIKE

02:08:24.830 --> 02:08:27.666
MR. IRONSIDE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING

02:08:27.733 --> 02:08:29.535
FOR DRUG TREATMENT AND REHAB AND

02:08:29.601 --> 02:08:32.738
CARE COURTS FOR MANY YEARS. SO A

02:08:32.805 --> 02:08:35.340
PERSON WHO FACES SOME CHARGE ON

02:08:35.407 --> 02:08:37.342
THIS, FIRST OF ALL, HIGHLY

02:08:37.409 --> 02:08:38.911
UNLIKELY THAT THIS IS GOING TO

02:08:38.977 --> 02:08:40.612
BE THE ONLY CHARGE THEY'RE GOING

02:08:40.679 --> 02:08:42.414
TO GET. SECOND OF ALL, IF THEY

02:08:42.481 --> 02:08:44.583
DID HAVE, THIS WOULD MAKE THEM

02:08:44.650 --> 02:08:47.152
ELIGIBLE FOR ALL KINDS OF DRUG

02:08:47.219 --> 02:08:50.422
REHAB CARE, COURT DIVERSION

02:08:50.489 --> 02:08:51.490
PROGRAMS THAT THEY OTHERWISE

02:08:51.557 --> 02:08:53.125
WOULDN'T BE ELIGIBLE FOR IF

02:08:53.192 --> 02:08:57.196
THERE WASN'T A DRUG CASE

02:08:57.262 --> 02:08:59.998
INVOLVED AS WELL. SO I GUESS

02:09:00.065 --> 02:09:03.035
WHAT I'M SAYING TO YOU IS I

02:09:03.102 --> 02:09:03.936
UNDERSTAND THE INCLINATION, AND

02:09:04.002 --> 02:09:05.170
THERE ARE SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO

02:09:05.237 --> 02:09:06.705
SPOKE TODAY THE INCLINATION TO

02:09:06.772 --> 02:09:08.407
SAY, JUST STOP CRIMINALIZING

02:09:08.474 --> 02:09:10.175
DRUGS. I DON'T QUITE AGREE WITH

02:09:10.242 --> 02:09:11.743
THAT, THOUGH, BECAUSE IF WE

02:09:11.810 --> 02:09:13.112
CAN'T MAKE IT ILLEGAL, THEN WE

02:09:13.178 --> 02:09:15.547
CAN'T REALLY ADDRESS IT. I DO

02:09:15.614 --> 02:09:18.083
AGREE THIS IS NOT IT DOESN'T

02:09:18.150 --> 02:09:20.152
WARRANT SCHEDULE ONE. IT IS NOT

02:09:20.219 --> 02:09:21.854
LIKE HEROIN. IT IS NOT LIKE SOME

02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:23.589
OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN

02:09:23.655 --> 02:09:25.257
DESCRIBED TO YOU HERE TODAY. IT

02:09:25.324 --> 02:09:28.794
CAN, HOWEVER, KILL YOU. AND

02:09:28.861 --> 02:09:31.330
WHAT'S THAT? IT WILL KILL YOU.

02:09:31.396 --> 02:09:33.365
AND YOU KNOW, HERE'S THE OTHER

02:09:33.432 --> 02:09:35.400
THING I WOULD SAY. WE NEED TO

02:09:35.467 --> 02:09:38.637
MAKE IT REALLY CLEAR TO PEOPLE

02:09:38.704 --> 02:09:41.974
WHO ARE DEALING THIS DRUG THAT

02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:44.476
IT IS NOT INTENDED FOR MARICHA'S

02:09:44.543 --> 02:09:47.613
SON, WHO'S NOW NO LONGER IN OUR

02:09:47.679 --> 02:09:48.914
WORLD BECAUSE OF SOMETHING

02:09:48.981 --> 02:09:51.316
EXACTLY LIKE THIS A VETERINARY

02:09:51.383 --> 02:09:53.285
DRUG CUT INTO FENTANYL TO MAKE

02:09:53.352 --> 02:09:56.588
THE HIGH LAST LONGER. HE IS

02:09:56.655 --> 02:10:00.759
GONE. WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING

02:10:00.826 --> 02:10:03.061
IN OUR POWER TO PREVENT THESE

02:10:03.128 --> 02:10:06.031
VERY DANGEROUS DRUGS INTENDED

02:10:06.098 --> 02:10:08.500
FOR ELEPHANTS AND GIRAFFES AND

02:10:08.567 --> 02:10:11.003
HORSES AND THINGS THAT WEIGH

02:10:11.069 --> 02:10:13.172
1,000 POUNDS TO NOT END UP IN

02:10:13.238 --> 02:10:16.742
THE SYSTEM OF YOUNG MEN IN OUR

02:10:16.808 --> 02:10:19.244
COMMUNITIES. SO I WOULD SUBMIT

02:10:19.311 --> 02:10:20.646
TO YOU THAT THE ONE PERSON

02:10:20.712 --> 02:10:22.648
SITTING IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY AS

02:10:22.714 --> 02:10:24.683
A WITNESS, AS YOU DESCRIBED IT,

02:10:24.750 --> 02:10:26.652
ASSEMBLYWOMAN, THAT IS FROM A

02:10:26.718 --> 02:10:28.153
BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITY, IS

02:10:28.220 --> 02:10:30.088
THE ONE WHOSE SON IS DECEASED.

02:10:30.155 --> 02:10:32.991
AS A RESULT OF THIS DRUG AND

02:10:33.058 --> 02:10:35.827
OTHER DRUGS LIKE IT NOT BEING

02:10:35.894 --> 02:10:38.163
ILLEGAL. SO I WOULD ASK YOU TO

02:10:38.230 --> 02:10:39.831
STRONGLY CONSIDER IT. AND IF YOU

02:10:39.898 --> 02:10:41.033
CAN'T DO IT TODAY, I UNDERSTAND.

02:10:41.099 --> 02:10:42.734
I'M HAPPY TO MEET WITH YOU AFTER

02:10:42.801 --> 02:10:43.969
THIS COMMITTEE. SHOULD THIS BILL

02:10:44.036 --> 02:10:45.837
MAKE IT OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE,

02:10:45.904 --> 02:10:47.105
I'LL FACE YOU AGAIN ON THE

02:10:47.172 --> 02:10:48.840
ASSEMBLY FLOOR. AND I WOULD HOPE

02:10:48.907 --> 02:10:50.542
THAT YOU WOULD REALLY THINK

02:10:50.609 --> 02:10:52.010
ABOUT IT. BUT I DO THINK THE

02:10:52.077 --> 02:10:53.645
FACT THAT IT IS SCHEDULE THREE

02:10:53.712 --> 02:10:55.247
AND NOT SCHEDULE ONE SHOULD GIVE

02:10:55.314 --> 02:10:57.149
YOU SOME MEASURE OF

02:10:57.216 --> 02:10:58.517
CONSIDERATION THAT IT IS NOT

02:10:58.584 --> 02:11:01.386
INTENDED TO INCARCERATE

02:11:01.453 --> 02:11:02.421
ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUALS, BUT

02:11:02.487 --> 02:11:03.956
RATHER INTENDED TO IDENTIFY A

02:11:04.022 --> 02:11:05.691
DRUG ISSUE, MAKE THAT DRUG

02:11:05.757 --> 02:11:07.960
ILLEGAL, AND SERVE THE PEOPLE OF

02:11:08.026 --> 02:11:10.996
OUR STATE. CAN I GO ONLY IF THE

02:11:11.063 --> 02:11:12.631
CHAIR ALLOWS YOU TO.

02:11:12.698 --> 02:11:13.765
ASSEMBLYWOMAN, YOU HAVE ANY MORE

02:11:13.832 --> 02:11:17.402
QUESTIONS? I DID HAVE ANOTHER

02:11:17.469 --> 02:11:17.970
RESPONSE, BUT IS IT OKAY TO

02:11:18.036 --> 02:11:20.439
RESPOND? GO AHEAD. YOU WANT THE

02:11:20.505 --> 02:11:22.040
VETERINARIAN? YES,

02:11:22.107 --> 02:11:22.708
ASSEMBLYMEMBER. THANK YOU. THANK

02:11:22.774 --> 02:11:23.675
YOU FOR THE LATITUDE.

02:11:23.742 --> 02:11:24.743
ASSEMBLYMEMBER. POINT OF

02:11:24.810 --> 02:11:26.245
CLARIFICATION. XYLAZINE IS NOT

02:11:26.311 --> 02:11:28.780
AN ADDICTIVE DRUG. XYLAZINE

02:11:28.847 --> 02:11:31.316
MEANING THAT I CAN GIVE THE SAME

02:11:31.383 --> 02:11:32.751
DOSE OF XYLAZINE TO A HORSE 100

02:11:32.818 --> 02:11:34.853
TIMES AND ACHIEVE THE EXACT SAME

02:11:34.920 --> 02:11:36.888
EFFECT IN THE HORSE ALL 100

02:11:36.955 --> 02:11:38.690
TIMES. THAT'S CONTRARY TO

02:11:38.757 --> 02:11:40.692
OPIOIDS, WHICH THE BODY BECOMES

02:11:40.759 --> 02:11:42.060
ADDICTED. SO THE MECHANISM BY

02:11:42.127 --> 02:11:43.862
WHICH AN OPIOID WORKS IN THE

02:11:43.929 --> 02:11:45.797
BODY IS THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE

02:11:45.864 --> 02:11:47.666
MORE AND MORE AND MORE OF IT TO,

02:11:47.733 --> 02:11:50.469
TO CHASE THAT HIGH. RIGHT. WITH

02:11:50.535 --> 02:11:51.803
XYLAZINE, THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

02:11:51.870 --> 02:11:53.872
SO IT ISN'T THE TYPE OF DRUG

02:11:53.939 --> 02:11:56.908
THAT SOMEBODY SAYS, I, I, I NEED

02:11:56.975 --> 02:12:00.779
THIS, I NEED MORE OF IT TO, TO

02:12:00.846 --> 02:12:04.349
FEEL THE WAY I WANT TO FEEL. A

02:12:04.416 --> 02:12:05.851
REHAB IS NOT GOING TO HELP

02:12:05.917 --> 02:12:08.353
SOMEBODY KICK AN ADDICTION TO

02:12:08.420 --> 02:12:09.054
XYLAZINE BECAUSE THEY DON'T

02:12:09.121 --> 02:12:10.555
BECOME ADDICTED TO XYLAZINE MOST

02:12:10.622 --> 02:12:13.091
OF THE TIME XYLAZINE IS PUT INTO

02:12:13.158 --> 02:12:14.693
THESE FENTANYL PRODUCTS WITHOUT

02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:17.496
THEM EVEN KNOWING IT. AND YOU

02:12:17.562 --> 02:12:20.232
KNOW THE VIAL. IT COMES IN A 100

02:12:20.299 --> 02:12:24.936
CC VIAL FROM OUR RESEARCH IN, IN

02:12:25.003 --> 02:12:27.239
IN THE SMALL RESEARCH THAT'S

02:12:27.306 --> 02:12:28.407
BEEN DONE IN THE FENTANYL

02:12:28.473 --> 02:12:30.208
XYLAZINE COMBINATION, A 100 CC

02:12:30.275 --> 02:12:32.110
VIAL COULD KILL EVERYBODY IN

02:12:32.177 --> 02:12:34.646
THIS ROOM CAN KILL UPWARDS OF 50

02:12:34.713 --> 02:12:36.748
PEOPLE. IF THAT'S NOT A DRUG

02:12:36.815 --> 02:12:38.317
THAT SHOULD BE UNDER LOCK AND

02:12:38.383 --> 02:12:41.586
KEY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS. THANK

02:12:41.653 --> 02:12:46.591
YOU. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. OKAY.

02:12:46.658 --> 02:12:50.662
WE GOOD. THANK YOU BOTH FOR TALK

02:12:50.729 --> 02:12:52.698
A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE

02:12:52.764 --> 02:12:54.533
BILL. AND I DO WANT TO SAY THAT

02:12:54.599 --> 02:12:56.001
I AM TRULY SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

02:12:56.068 --> 02:12:59.104
I REALLY AM SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

02:12:59.171 --> 02:13:01.006
AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD

02:13:01.073 --> 02:13:05.277
IN THIS STATE AND AS VOTERS HAVE

02:13:05.344 --> 02:13:08.814
VOTED FOR 36, IT IS IT IS WHAT

02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:10.615
IT IS. I TRULY ASK US, THOUGH,

02:13:10.682 --> 02:13:12.017
AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD

02:13:12.084 --> 02:13:14.986
TO PUSH FORTH LEGISLATION, THAT

02:13:15.053 --> 02:13:16.421
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THINGS

02:13:16.488 --> 02:13:17.956
SUCH AS THIS AND WE WANT TO

02:13:18.023 --> 02:13:19.558
REALLY HELP PEOPLE, YOU SAY THAT

02:13:19.624 --> 02:13:21.493
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO HELP THEM

02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:23.628
GET REHAB, CARE AND DIVERSIONS,

02:13:23.695 --> 02:13:26.131
BUT AS WE KNOW, THE FUNDING IS

02:13:26.198 --> 02:13:28.200
NOT WHERE IT PROBABLY SHOULD BE

02:13:28.266 --> 02:13:30.068
TO HELP TO GET THAT DONE. WE

02:13:30.135 --> 02:13:31.903
DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO GET

02:13:31.970 --> 02:13:33.071
IT DONE. THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS

02:13:33.138 --> 02:13:34.873
THAT COME INTO PLAY TO KEEPING

02:13:34.940 --> 02:13:36.942
THE PROMISE. AGAIN, THAT'S BEING

02:13:37.008 --> 02:13:37.776
STATED HERE THAT IF WE DO THIS,

02:13:37.843 --> 02:13:39.077
THIS COULD HELP HERE. I JUST

02:13:39.144 --> 02:13:41.680
NEED US TO DO A BETTER JOB. AND

02:13:41.747 --> 02:13:44.149
ME BEING ELECTED HERE TO WE

02:13:44.216 --> 02:13:45.650
COLLECTIVELY HAVE TO DO A BETTER

02:13:45.717 --> 02:13:46.685
JOB OF MAKING SURE THAT WE DO

02:13:46.752 --> 02:13:48.820
KEEP THE PROMISE AND PROVIDE

02:13:48.887 --> 02:13:49.955
TREATMENT AND GET IT THERE SO

02:13:50.021 --> 02:13:51.690
PEOPLE CAN GET THE CARE THAT

02:13:51.757 --> 02:13:54.159
THEY NEED. BECAUSE I'M TIRED OF

02:13:54.226 --> 02:13:54.793
HAVING THESE SAME CONVERSATIONS

02:13:54.860 --> 02:13:56.027
WHEN WE KNOW THAT IT'S GOING TO

02:13:56.094 --> 02:13:58.463
HURT OUR PEOPLE. EITHER WAY, ON

02:13:58.530 --> 02:13:59.765
BOTH SIDES, NO ONE'S WINNING IN

02:13:59.831 --> 02:14:00.699
THIS SITUATION, AND I WISH THAT

02:14:00.766 --> 02:14:05.337
WE CAN COME UP WITH A BETTER WAY

02:14:05.404 --> 02:14:05.971
TO ADDRESS THIS. YOUR WORDS HAS

02:14:06.037 --> 02:14:10.008
BEEN HELPFUL. SO I'M STILL GOING

02:14:10.075 --> 02:14:11.143
TO PROCESS IN THIS MOMENT UNTIL

02:14:11.209 --> 02:14:13.612
HE CALLS FOR THE VOTE. I'M JUST

02:14:13.678 --> 02:14:16.014
NOT A FAN OF THE WAY WE DO

02:14:16.081 --> 02:14:17.716
THINGS RIGHT NOW AS IT PERTAINS

02:14:17.783 --> 02:14:19.718
TO SERVICING OUR PEOPLE. AND WE

02:14:19.785 --> 02:14:21.119
COLLECTIVELY ALL WE HAVE TO DO A

02:14:21.186 --> 02:14:22.554
BETTER JOB COLLECTIVELY OF

02:14:22.621 --> 02:14:25.390
GETTING THIS RIGHT. THANK YOU

02:14:25.457 --> 02:14:26.558
FOR THANK YOU FOR THANK YOU,

02:14:26.625 --> 02:14:27.926
MISS. ASSEMBLYWOMAN.

02:14:27.993 --> 02:14:29.161
ASSEMBLYMEMBER. THANK YOU, MR.

02:14:29.227 --> 02:14:31.396
CHAIR. I WANT TO APPRECIATE ALL

02:14:31.463 --> 02:14:33.698
THE EFFORTS FROM THE AUTHOR, THE

02:14:33.765 --> 02:14:34.232
SUPPORTING WITNESSES, AND

02:14:34.299 --> 02:14:36.401
OBVIOUSLY, MA'AM, JUST ECHO MY

02:14:36.468 --> 02:14:37.803
COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO'S

02:14:37.869 --> 02:14:39.671
COMMENTS, YOU KNOW, GUTTED BY

02:14:39.738 --> 02:14:41.139
YOUR LOSS AND APPRECIATE YOU

02:14:41.206 --> 02:14:42.707
BEING HERE. AND IT'S VERY

02:14:42.774 --> 02:14:43.942
POWERFUL TO HEAR FROM YOU AND

02:14:44.009 --> 02:14:44.676
APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITION. I

02:14:44.743 --> 02:14:46.344
DON'T THINK ANYONE CAN DISAGREE

02:14:46.411 --> 02:14:48.613
WITH YOUR YOUR OPINION. AND I DO

02:14:48.680 --> 02:14:50.882
THINK THAT FOR US UP HERE, YOU

02:14:50.949 --> 02:14:52.584
KNOW, WE ONLY HAVE SO MANY TOOLS

02:14:52.651 --> 02:14:53.885
TO TRY TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES

02:14:53.952 --> 02:14:55.787
AND WE WANT TO SAVE LIVES. I

02:14:55.854 --> 02:14:57.155
THINK THAT'S THE POINT OF THIS

02:14:57.222 --> 02:14:58.957
COMMITTEE. IT'S THE POINT OF THE

02:14:59.024 --> 02:15:00.892
LEGISLATURE. AND I DO THINK THAT

02:15:00.959 --> 02:15:02.727
WE HAVE AN IMPERFECT SYSTEM IN

02:15:02.794 --> 02:15:03.762
ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES. AND I

02:15:03.829 --> 02:15:06.398
THINK THAT SENATOR COLLINS MADE

02:15:06.465 --> 02:15:08.099
A LOT OF GOOD POINTS. I DO THINK

02:15:08.166 --> 02:15:11.570
THAT THE AUTHOR ALSO MADE SOME

02:15:11.636 --> 02:15:13.905
GREAT POINTS IN THAT THIS IS A

02:15:13.972 --> 02:15:14.840
MULTI-PRONGED APPROACH THAT WE

02:15:14.906 --> 02:15:16.107
NEED TO TAKE, AND OBVIOUSLY WE

02:15:16.174 --> 02:15:17.709
NEED TO INVEST MORE IN

02:15:17.776 --> 02:15:18.443
BEHAVIORAL SERVICES AND

02:15:18.510 --> 02:15:19.811
ADDICTION SERVICES. AND THIS

02:15:19.878 --> 02:15:21.346
ISN'T A PANACEA OR A SILVER

02:15:21.413 --> 02:15:24.216
BULLET, BUT I DO THINK THAT WE

02:15:24.282 --> 02:15:26.418
NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO CURB THE

02:15:26.485 --> 02:15:28.854
SUPPLY. AND I DO THINK THAT THE

02:15:28.920 --> 02:15:30.655
SUPPLY OF THIS SUBSTANCE IS A

02:15:30.722 --> 02:15:32.123
PROBLEM. IT'S KILLING PEOPLE. I

02:15:32.190 --> 02:15:34.059
DO THINK THAT THE DATA THAT WE

02:15:34.125 --> 02:15:36.127
SEE IN FLORIDA AND OTHER STATES,

02:15:36.194 --> 02:15:38.196
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE, MAYBE THE

02:15:38.263 --> 02:15:40.432
DEATHS AND MAYBE THE, THE

02:15:40.499 --> 02:15:41.533
NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES WOULD HAVE

02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:43.668
BEEN HIGHER IF THEY HADN'T HAVE

02:15:43.735 --> 02:15:45.036
ACTUALLY ACTED ON IT. I MEAN, SO

02:15:45.103 --> 02:15:46.972
WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF SAYING,

02:15:47.038 --> 02:15:49.341
WELL, EVEN AFTER THEY MADE IT A

02:15:49.407 --> 02:15:51.209
CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE, DEATHS

02:15:51.276 --> 02:15:53.078
STILL WENT UP AND USE WENT UP.

02:15:53.144 --> 02:15:55.547
WELL, YES. BUT IN THE IN THE

02:15:55.614 --> 02:15:57.749
COUNTERFACTUAL THAT WE HAVE NO

02:15:57.816 --> 02:15:58.817
IDEA WHAT THAT WOULD BE, I HAVE

02:15:58.884 --> 02:15:59.951
NO DOUBT THAT USE WOULD HAVE

02:16:00.018 --> 02:16:01.753
STILL GONE UP AND DEATHS STILL

02:16:01.820 --> 02:16:03.054
WOULD HAVE GONE UP. RIGHT. SO WE

02:16:03.121 --> 02:16:05.757
NEED TO BE CAREFUL AS TO

02:16:05.824 --> 02:16:06.358
CORRELATION, CAUSATION AND HOW

02:16:06.424 --> 02:16:08.193
WE USE STATISTICS. AND TO THE

02:16:08.260 --> 02:16:09.961
POINT ABOUT WE DON'T HAVE A

02:16:10.028 --> 02:16:12.063
SCIENTIFIC BASIS TO MAKE THIS

02:16:12.130 --> 02:16:14.599
JUDGMENT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT A

02:16:14.666 --> 02:16:16.368
SCIENTIFIC BASIS LOOKS LIKE

02:16:16.434 --> 02:16:18.937
OTHER THAN SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

02:16:19.004 --> 02:16:21.907
DEATHS AND USAGE ARE OCCURRING

02:16:21.973 --> 02:16:24.676
EVERY YEAR, AND WE SEE THE

02:16:24.743 --> 02:16:27.913
OUTCOMES OF TRANK USE. YOU HAVE

02:16:27.979 --> 02:16:30.916
TO AMPUTATE IN CERTAIN CASES,

02:16:30.982 --> 02:16:34.085
LIMBS FROM VERY FEW USES OF IT.

02:16:34.152 --> 02:16:35.487
THAT SEEMS PRETTY SCIENTIFIC TO

02:16:35.554 --> 02:16:37.689
ME THAT THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS

02:16:37.756 --> 02:16:39.090
SUBSTANCE. AND TO THE EXTENT

02:16:39.157 --> 02:16:41.026
THAT SUPPLIERS AND DEALERS ARE

02:16:41.092 --> 02:16:42.861
OPENLY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF OUR

02:16:42.928 --> 02:16:43.628
COMMUNITIES, THE SAME

02:16:43.695 --> 02:16:45.263
COMMUNITIES THAT ASSEMBLYMEMBERS

02:16:45.330 --> 02:16:46.765
COLLINS TALKED ABOUT, IT'S

02:16:46.831 --> 02:16:48.600
INCUMBENT ON US TO DO SOMETHING.

02:16:48.667 --> 02:16:50.368
AND UNTIL WE DECRIMINALIZE ALL

02:16:50.435 --> 02:16:51.836
DRUGS AND UNTIL WE FULLY FUND

02:16:51.903 --> 02:16:53.638
OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM AND

02:16:53.705 --> 02:16:55.340
DRUG ADDICTION TREATMENT

02:16:55.407 --> 02:16:56.942
CENTERS, WE NEED TO CURB THE

02:16:57.008 --> 02:16:59.244
SUPPLY. I DON'T WANT TO SEE A

02:16:59.311 --> 02:17:01.046
BUNCH OF USERS WHO ACTUALLY NEED

02:17:01.112 --> 02:17:05.450
THE HELP BE INCARCERATED, PUT

02:17:05.517 --> 02:17:06.384
INTO OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE

02:17:06.451 --> 02:17:08.219
SYSTEM. I THINK THAT IS A

02:17:08.286 --> 02:17:08.954
NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCE OF THIS,

02:17:09.020 --> 02:17:11.323
AND I WILL FULLY ADMIT THAT I

02:17:11.389 --> 02:17:12.824
WOULD LOVE TO SEE A SYSTEM IN

02:17:12.891 --> 02:17:15.026
WHICH WE CAN JUST GO AFTER

02:17:15.093 --> 02:17:16.995
DEALERS, JUST GO AFTER SUPPLIERS,

02:17:17.062 --> 02:17:18.763
AND PROSECUTE THEM TO THE

02:17:18.830 --> 02:17:20.231
FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW

02:17:20.298 --> 02:17:21.266
BECAUSE THEY'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE

02:17:21.333 --> 02:17:22.801
OF INNOCENT PEOPLE AND THEY'RE

02:17:22.867 --> 02:17:25.770
MAKING MONEY OFF OF FOLKS. OUR

02:17:25.837 --> 02:17:28.106
WITNESSES, SON, IS A GOOD

02:17:28.173 --> 02:17:30.809
EXAMPLE OF IT, BUT WE DON'T HAVE

02:17:30.875 --> 02:17:32.377
THE ABILITY TO UNFORTUNATELY, DO

02:17:32.444 --> 02:17:34.145
THAT. I MEAN, I WOULD CALL UPON

02:17:34.212 --> 02:17:37.248
OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS,

02:17:37.315 --> 02:17:39.551
MANY OF WHOM ARE HERE. YOU GO

02:17:39.618 --> 02:17:42.153
INTO LA COUNTY, YOU GO INTO ANY

02:17:42.220 --> 02:17:43.688
MAJOR CITY, OPEN DRUG DEALING ON

02:17:43.755 --> 02:17:45.790
THE STREETS, OPEN DRUG DEALING,

02:17:45.857 --> 02:17:47.025
WHETHER IT'S TRAFFIC, WHETHER

02:17:47.092 --> 02:17:49.027
IT'S FENTANYL, WHETHER IT'S A

02:17:49.094 --> 02:17:50.829
LOT OF DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES. AND

02:17:50.895 --> 02:17:52.063
OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS ARE

02:17:52.130 --> 02:17:54.032
NOT DOING ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY

02:17:54.099 --> 02:17:55.900
ARREST DEALERS, PROSECUTE THEM,

02:17:55.967 --> 02:17:57.569
AND ACTUALLY TRY TO CURB THE

02:17:57.636 --> 02:17:58.737
SUPPLY. SO WHETHER IT'S TRANK OR

02:17:58.803 --> 02:18:00.372
ANY OTHER SUBSTANCE, I WOULD

02:18:00.438 --> 02:18:02.240
CALL UPON ALL OF US TO DO MORE

02:18:02.307 --> 02:18:04.109
AND ACTUALLY BRINGING SOME

02:18:04.175 --> 02:18:05.477
CONSEQUENCES IN FUNNELING

02:18:05.543 --> 02:18:07.278
ILLICIT DRUGS INTO OUR

02:18:07.345 --> 02:18:08.146
COMMUNITIES. AND I THINK THIS IS

02:18:08.213 --> 02:18:10.548
PART OF THAT. AND SO WHILE I DO

02:18:10.615 --> 02:18:11.650
AGREE THAT THIS IS TOUGH, I

02:18:11.716 --> 02:18:12.984
DON'T THINK THIS IS A PERFECT

02:18:13.051 --> 02:18:14.919
WAY OF ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM. I

02:18:14.986 --> 02:18:16.054
THINK WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

02:18:16.121 --> 02:18:17.956
AGAIN, I DON'T THINK THE ANSWER

02:18:18.023 --> 02:18:19.624
IS WE JUST DON'T DO ANYTHING

02:18:19.691 --> 02:18:21.059
BECAUSE UNTIL WE HAVE A SYSTEM

02:18:21.126 --> 02:18:22.694
IN WHICH WE TOTALLY REVAMP THE

02:18:22.761 --> 02:18:24.963
WAY THAT WE VIEW DRUGS, AND THAT

02:18:25.030 --> 02:18:26.965
WOULD BE ALL DRUGS ARE LEGAL.

02:18:27.032 --> 02:18:29.501
ALL OF THEM ARE DISPENSED FROM A

02:18:29.567 --> 02:18:31.302
FROM A DISPENSARY OR SOME SORT

02:18:31.369 --> 02:18:33.238
OF PHARMACY. WE'RE NOT THERE.

02:18:33.304 --> 02:18:35.774
AND UNTIL WE GET THERE, WE NEED

02:18:35.840 --> 02:18:36.841
TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE

02:18:36.908 --> 02:18:38.276
ACTUALLY HAVE SOME CONSEQUENCES

02:18:38.343 --> 02:18:39.177
FOR SUPPLYING OUR COMMUNITIES

02:18:39.244 --> 02:18:41.413
WITH VERY HARMFUL SUBSTANCES,

02:18:41.479 --> 02:18:43.114
JUST AS THIS. SO I WILL SUPPORT

02:18:43.181 --> 02:18:44.749
IT. TODAY I'M GOING TO MOVE THE

02:18:44.816 --> 02:18:46.351
BILL AND APPRECIATE THE

02:18:46.418 --> 02:18:49.354
DISCUSSION WE HAD TODAY. ANYONE

02:18:49.421 --> 02:18:58.329
ELSE? MR. LACKEY? I THINK THIS

02:18:58.396 --> 02:18:59.798
IS REALLY AN IMPORTANT

02:18:59.864 --> 02:19:02.133
DISCUSSION. AND I THINK WHAT'S

02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:04.035
KIND OF GETTING LOST HERE IS THE

02:19:04.102 --> 02:19:07.138
FACT THAT TRYING TO SCHEDULE

02:19:07.205 --> 02:19:12.610
THIS SUBSTANCE RECOGNIZES THE

02:19:12.677 --> 02:19:15.346
MISUSE OF THIS SUBSTANCE,

02:19:15.413 --> 02:19:16.781
WHETHER IT LEADS TO

02:19:16.848 --> 02:19:18.416
INCARCERATION TREATMENT, THAT'S

02:19:18.483 --> 02:19:19.984
KIND OF A DIFFERENT HOW IT'S

02:19:20.051 --> 02:19:22.921
APPLIED, IS NOT PRESCRIBED IN

02:19:22.987 --> 02:19:24.723
WHAT YOU PROPOSED. THAT'S TRUE.

02:19:24.789 --> 02:19:27.492
ALL YOU PROPOSED IS THAT WE

02:19:27.559 --> 02:19:29.761
RECOGNIZE IT AS A CONTROLLED

02:19:29.828 --> 02:19:33.231
SUBSTANCE. AND I THINK, HOW CAN

02:19:33.298 --> 02:19:34.799
YOU ARGUE AGAINST THAT? THIS IS

02:19:34.866 --> 02:19:38.136
AN ANIMAL TRANQUILIZER. AND THIS

02:19:38.203 --> 02:19:39.804
IS NOT AN ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCE.

02:19:39.871 --> 02:19:41.206
IT'S USED FOR A DIFFERENT

02:19:41.272 --> 02:19:43.441
PURPOSE. IT'S USUALLY NOT EVEN

02:19:43.508 --> 02:19:45.910
USED BY ITSELF. IT'S USUALLY

02:19:45.977 --> 02:19:49.347
USED AS AN ENHANCEMENT TO

02:19:49.414 --> 02:19:51.082
INCREASE THE IMPACT OR LIKE A

02:19:51.149 --> 02:19:53.118
SYNERGISTIC IMPACT OF A

02:19:53.184 --> 02:19:55.153
SUBSTANCE. AND SO THIS SHOULD

02:19:55.220 --> 02:19:57.055
NOT EVEN BE DEBATABLE, THAT IT

02:19:57.122 --> 02:19:58.356
SHOULD BE CONTROLLED. AND THAT'S

02:19:58.423 --> 02:20:02.193
ALL THAT THIS BILL DOES. AND SO

02:20:02.260 --> 02:20:02.761
I'M CLEARLY HAPPY TO SUPPORT

02:20:02.827 --> 02:20:06.865
COMMON SENSE. THANK YOU. SURE.

02:20:06.931 --> 02:20:09.467
I'LL SECOND THE MOTION. AND A

02:20:09.534 --> 02:20:12.203
SECOND SO I WILL I'LL END ON

02:20:12.270 --> 02:20:14.339
THIS PART AND I'LL HAVE YOU

02:20:14.405 --> 02:20:15.340
CLOSE. SENATOR. THINGS THAT WERE

02:20:15.406 --> 02:20:16.674
BROUGHT UP AS FAR AS LAW

02:20:16.741 --> 02:20:17.976
ENFORCEMENT. SO AS EVERYBODY MAY

02:20:18.042 --> 02:20:19.811
KNOW, I WAS PRIOR LAW

02:20:19.878 --> 02:20:22.847
ENFORCEMENT. AND I HAD A BILL A

02:20:22.914 --> 02:20:24.783
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHERE WE

02:20:24.849 --> 02:20:26.017
PASSED THAT. I WANTED TO KNOW

02:20:26.084 --> 02:20:28.019
WHERE TRANQ WAS AS FAR AS

02:20:28.086 --> 02:20:29.053
OVERDOSES GO. AND SO MAKING SURE

02:20:29.120 --> 02:20:30.488
THAT WHEN THE AUTOPSIES WERE

02:20:30.555 --> 02:20:31.756
THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY FIND OUT

02:20:31.823 --> 02:20:34.125
THE NUMBERS. GOING BACK TO THE

02:20:34.192 --> 02:20:35.994
COMMENT THAT YOU MADE WITH US

02:20:36.060 --> 02:20:37.061
WEAVING ALL OF OUR LAWS

02:20:37.128 --> 02:20:39.030
TOGETHER, NOT ONE WILL FIX IT,

02:20:39.097 --> 02:20:40.331
BUT TOGETHER WE CAN ALL

02:20:40.398 --> 02:20:41.833
ACCOMPLISH AT LEAST A BIG CHUNK

02:20:41.900 --> 02:20:44.669
OF THAT. ANOTHER THING IS, IT'S

02:20:44.736 --> 02:20:45.770
HARD TO ENFORCE LAWS WHEN

02:20:45.837 --> 02:20:46.871
THERE'S A DRUG OUT ON THE

02:20:46.938 --> 02:20:49.140
STREETS THAT I CAN'T ENFORCE. SO

02:20:49.207 --> 02:20:50.608
BY DOING THIS, THIS WILL HELP

02:20:50.675 --> 02:20:54.012
LAW ENFORCEMENT DO THAT. THIS IS

02:20:54.078 --> 02:20:54.946
SOMETHING WE BROUGHT UP A COUPLE

02:20:55.013 --> 02:20:56.681
YEARS AGO WITH TRANQ. THIS IS

02:20:56.748 --> 02:20:58.049
SOMETHING I BROUGHT UP RIGHT

02:20:58.116 --> 02:21:00.018
HERE IN THIS ROOM THAT WE HAD

02:21:00.084 --> 02:21:01.853
THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THAT

02:21:01.920 --> 02:21:03.688
ILLEGAL AT THE TIME, INSTEAD OF

02:21:03.755 --> 02:21:05.456
CHASING IT CONTINUOUSLY, ALWAYS

02:21:05.523 --> 02:21:07.258
CHASING, ALWAYS CHANGING AND

02:21:07.325 --> 02:21:09.160
CHASING THE, THE, THE NEW DRUGS

02:21:09.227 --> 02:21:10.829
THAT COME ONTO THE MARKET. AND

02:21:10.895 --> 02:21:11.796
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO

02:21:11.863 --> 02:21:13.464
THIS. THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WE

02:21:13.531 --> 02:21:14.899
DON'T EVEN KNOW OF YET THAT

02:21:14.966 --> 02:21:16.467
WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT

02:21:16.534 --> 02:21:18.570
IN A YEAR OR TWO FROM NOW. I

02:21:18.636 --> 02:21:20.572
LOOK AT THIS JUST LIKE WITH ANY

02:21:20.638 --> 02:21:21.773
OTHER CRIMES THAT WE NEVER EVEN

02:21:21.840 --> 02:21:24.342
THOUGHT WERE GOING TO BE ON THE

02:21:24.409 --> 02:21:25.143
BOOKS, THAT HAD TO DO WITH,

02:21:25.210 --> 02:21:25.810
LIKE, LET'S SAY, INTERNET

02:21:25.877 --> 02:21:28.546
CRIMES. YOU KNOW, 20 PLUS YEARS

02:21:28.613 --> 02:21:29.247
AGO, WE HAD NO IDEA WE EVEN HAD

02:21:29.314 --> 02:21:30.782
LIKE AN INTERNET CRIMES OR I,

02:21:30.849 --> 02:21:32.650
STUFF LIKE THAT. SO WE NEED TO

02:21:32.717 --> 02:21:34.018
EVOLVE AND WE NEED TO ADDRESS

02:21:34.085 --> 02:21:36.087
THOSE ISSUES AS IT GOES. AND I

02:21:36.154 --> 02:21:37.055
THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL

02:21:37.121 --> 02:21:38.957
DOES. I'M I'M HAPPY THAT YOU

02:21:39.023 --> 02:21:40.091
BROUGHT THIS FORWARD. AND I KNOW

02:21:40.158 --> 02:21:41.960
THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS FROM

02:21:42.026 --> 02:21:42.727
SOME OF OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS,

02:21:42.794 --> 02:21:43.728
AND RIGHTFULLY SO. BUT I THINK

02:21:43.795 --> 02:21:46.130
THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE

02:21:46.197 --> 02:21:47.632
INTENT THAT YOU HAVE WITH THIS

02:21:47.699 --> 02:21:48.933
IS WITH A GOOD HEART, MAKING

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:49.934
SURE THAT PEOPLE GET THE HELP

02:21:50.001 --> 02:21:51.836
THAT THEY NEED AND MAKING SURE

02:21:51.903 --> 02:21:53.638
THAT WE CONTINUE TO KEEP OUR

02:21:53.705 --> 02:21:54.806
PUBLIC SAFE. AND BY DOING THAT,

02:21:54.873 --> 02:21:57.075
WE HAVE TO GIVE THOSE TOOLS TO

02:21:57.141 --> 02:21:57.842
LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DO THAT. SO

02:21:57.909 --> 02:21:59.777
WITH THAT, I'LL HAVE YOU CLOSE.

02:21:59.844 --> 02:22:01.646
BUT PRIOR TO THAT, THE CHAIR HAS

02:22:01.713 --> 02:22:03.781
A NON RECO ON THIS AND YOU MAY

02:22:03.848 --> 02:22:06.017
CLOSE. YEAH. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

02:22:06.084 --> 02:22:07.986

02:22:08.052 --> 02:22:10.655
AND TO THE MEMBERS WHO SPOKE SO

02:22:10.722 --> 02:22:12.423
ELOQUENTLY. EVERYBODY WHO

02:22:12.490 --> 02:22:14.626
PARTICIPATES IN THIS PROCESS

02:22:14.692 --> 02:22:17.262
MAKES THE BILLS BETTER AND MORE

02:22:17.328 --> 02:22:19.831
EFFECTIVE TO HELP ACHIEVE THE

02:22:19.898 --> 02:22:21.399
GOAL. WE ALL ULTIMATELY WANT TO

02:22:21.466 --> 02:22:23.134
ACHIEVE, WHICH IS HELPING PEOPLE

02:22:23.201 --> 02:22:26.170
IN CALIFORNIA. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:22:26.237 --> 02:22:27.972
COULDN'T BE MORE RIGHT. I DON'T

02:22:28.039 --> 02:22:29.007
PROPOSE TO HAVE THE ONE

02:22:29.073 --> 02:22:30.041
SOLUTION. I'M JUST A SENATOR.

02:22:30.108 --> 02:22:32.310
JUST ONE PIECE. AS

02:22:32.377 --> 02:22:34.012
ASSEMBLYMEMBER ALANIS SAID, IT'S

02:22:34.078 --> 02:22:36.214
ONE PART OF A WOVEN SOLUTION. WE

02:22:36.281 --> 02:22:38.716
NEED OUR COURTS. WE NEED DRUG

02:22:38.783 --> 02:22:40.818
PROGRAMING, WE NEED BEHAVIORAL

02:22:40.885 --> 02:22:42.420
SERVICES, BUT WE ALSO NEED TO

02:22:42.487 --> 02:22:44.822
GIVE TOOLS. AND I HAVE ELECTED

02:22:44.889 --> 02:22:48.092
THE LOWEST LEVEL OF SCHEDULE

02:22:48.159 --> 02:22:50.728
POSSIBLE FOR A LETHAL DRUG. BUT

02:22:50.795 --> 02:22:52.196
DON'T TAKE IT FROM ME. I'M JUST

02:22:52.263 --> 02:22:54.265
A SENATOR. I DON'T I DON'T HAVE

02:22:54.332 --> 02:22:56.034

02:22:58.369 --> 02:23:00.071

02:23:22.894 --> 02:23:24.095

BECAUSE HE KNOWS HOW LETHAL IT

02:23:34.639 --> 02:23:36.975
IS. DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT.

02:23:37.041 --> 02:23:39.477
I'M NOT AN EXPERT. I DID NOT

02:23:39.544 --> 02:23:42.513
LOSE MY SON, AND I DO NOT PUT

02:23:42.580 --> 02:23:43.982

02:55:50.806 --> 02:55:52.241
FOR THANK YOU TO MR. GONZALEZ

02:55:52.308 --> 02:55:54.377
AND TO OUR VICE CHAIR FOR

02:55:54.443 --> 02:55:55.478
SHEPHERDING THE COMMITTEE IN MY

02:55:55.544 --> 02:55:58.047
ABSENCE. NEXT UP WE HAVE ITEM

02:55:58.114 --> 02:56:00.182
NUMBER NINE. THIS IS BY SENATOR

02:56:00.249 --> 02:56:01.817
CABALLERO. THIS IS SENATE BILL

02:56:01.884 --> 02:56:03.085
690. SENATOR, YOU'LL HAVE FIVE

02:56:03.152 --> 02:56:04.887
MINUTES TO PRESENT, AS WILL YOUR

02:56:04.954 --> 02:56:06.389
PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

02:56:06.455 --> 02:56:13.462
AND WE'LL GO FROM THERE.

02:56:13.529 --> 02:56:18.367
WELCOME. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR.

02:56:18.434 --> 02:56:21.037
AND MEMBERS, I RISE TODAY TO

02:56:21.103 --> 02:56:23.239
PRESENT SB 690, A BILL TO

02:56:23.306 --> 02:56:24.607
PROTECT CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES

02:56:24.674 --> 02:56:27.109
FROM A WAVE OF ABUSIVE AND

02:56:27.176 --> 02:56:28.477
PREDATORY LAWSUITS THAT ARE

02:56:28.544 --> 02:56:30.346
THREATENING JOBS, INNOVATION AND

02:56:30.413 --> 02:56:32.081
THE ABILITY TO DO BUSINESS IN

02:56:32.148 --> 02:56:34.450
OUR STATE. OVER THE LAST FEW

02:56:34.517 --> 02:56:36.919
YEARS, JUST A HANDFUL OF TRIAL

02:56:36.986 --> 02:56:38.587
LAWYERS, MAINLY FROM FOUR LAW

02:56:38.654 --> 02:56:40.222
FIRMS, HAVE SENT OUT THOUSANDS

02:56:40.289 --> 02:56:41.223
OF DEMAND LETTERS AND SUED MORE

02:56:41.290 --> 02:56:44.060
THAN 1700 CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES.

02:56:44.126 --> 02:56:46.162
THAT NUMBER GROWS EVERY WEEK.

02:56:46.228 --> 02:56:49.465
THESE LAWSUITS USE A 1967

02:56:49.532 --> 02:56:52.068
WIRETAPPING LAW, THE CALIFORNIA

02:56:52.134 --> 02:56:54.570
INVASION OF PRIVACY ACT, OR CPA,

02:56:54.637 --> 02:56:56.806
TO ARGUE THAT EVERY DAY ONLINE

02:56:56.872 --> 02:56:59.141
TOOLS LIKE WEBSITE ANALYTICS AND

02:56:59.208 --> 02:57:01.677
COOKIES ARE SOMEHOW WIRETAPPING

02:57:01.744 --> 02:57:03.179
TAPPING. THEY CLAIM THAT

02:57:03.245 --> 02:57:04.947
TRACKING ONLINE SHOPPING CARTS

02:57:05.014 --> 02:57:07.216
OR SHOWING PERSONALIZED ADS IS

02:57:07.283 --> 02:57:09.385
THE SAME AS SECRETLY RECORDING A

02:57:09.452 --> 02:57:11.887
PHONE CALL. WHY? BECAUSE CPA

02:57:11.954 --> 02:57:15.091
CARRIES A $5,000 PENALTY PER

02:57:15.157 --> 02:57:18.194
VIOLATION. THAT MEANS $5,000 PER

02:57:18.260 --> 02:57:20.496
WEBSITE VISIT. FOR LARGER

02:57:20.563 --> 02:57:21.864
BUSINESSES WITH MILLIONS OF

02:57:21.931 --> 02:57:23.332
VISITORS, THE LIABILITY ADDS UP

02:57:23.399 --> 02:57:24.867
TO HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

02:57:24.934 --> 02:57:26.969
DOLLARS. BUSINESSES LARGE AND

02:57:27.036 --> 02:57:28.704
SMALL ARE SETTLING THESE

02:57:28.771 --> 02:57:29.805
LAWSUITS NOT BECAUSE THEY'VE

02:57:29.872 --> 02:57:31.507
DONE ANYTHING WRONG, BUT BECAUSE

02:57:31.574 --> 02:57:33.776
LITIGATION UNDER CPA IS

02:57:33.843 --> 02:57:35.277
FINANCIALLY DEVASTATING. THE

02:57:35.344 --> 02:57:36.946
COST OF DEFENDING EVEN A

02:57:37.013 --> 02:57:39.048
MERITLESS CLAIM CAN EXCEED THE

02:57:39.115 --> 02:57:42.451
COST OF SETTLING. PLAINTIFFS ARE

02:57:42.518 --> 02:57:44.487
TARGETING NONPROFITS, LOCAL

02:57:44.553 --> 02:57:46.322
RETAILERS AND FAMILY RUN

02:57:46.389 --> 02:57:48.391
OPERATIONS ALONGSIDE LARGE

02:57:48.457 --> 02:57:49.625
CORPORATIONS. THE VOLUME AND

02:57:49.692 --> 02:57:51.060
NATURE OF THESE LAWSUITS SHOW

02:57:51.127 --> 02:57:53.195
THAT NO BUSINESS CATEGORY IS

02:57:53.262 --> 02:57:54.563
EXEMPT. A SMALL NUMBER OF

02:57:54.630 --> 02:57:56.799
PLAINTIFFS ARE BEING USED

02:57:56.866 --> 02:57:58.267
REPEATEDLY TO FILE HUNDREDS OF

02:57:58.334 --> 02:58:00.036
NEARLY IDENTICAL LAWSUITS. IN

02:58:00.102 --> 02:58:02.138
SOME CASES, THE SAME INDIVIDUAL

02:58:02.204 --> 02:58:04.206
HAS BEEN USED IN OVER 100

02:58:04.273 --> 02:58:06.008
SEPARATE CASES, A CLEAR

02:58:06.075 --> 02:58:07.576
INDICATION THAT THIS IS A

02:58:07.643 --> 02:58:09.378
COORDINATED LEGAL STRATEGY, NOT

02:58:09.445 --> 02:58:12.248
A RESPONSE TO ACTUAL CONSUMER

02:58:12.314 --> 02:58:14.417
HARM. HOWEVER, CALIFORNIA

02:58:14.483 --> 02:58:15.818
ALREADY HAS THE STRONGEST

02:58:15.885 --> 02:58:18.020
PRIVACY LAW IN THE NATION, THE

02:58:18.087 --> 02:58:19.355
CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PROTECTION

02:58:19.422 --> 02:58:23.392
ACT, OR CCPA. BACK IN 2018, THIS

02:58:23.459 --> 02:58:25.928
LEGISLATURE PASSED CCPA TO GIVE

02:58:25.995 --> 02:58:27.029
CONSUMERS REAL CONTROL OVER

02:58:27.096 --> 02:58:29.865
THEIR DATA USING A MODERN OPT

02:58:29.932 --> 02:58:32.401
OUT APPROACH. AND IN 2020,

02:58:32.468 --> 02:58:33.736
VOTERS OVERWHELMINGLY

02:58:33.803 --> 02:58:35.371
STRENGTHENED THAT LAW AT THE

02:58:35.438 --> 02:58:38.140
BALLOT BOX. THE CCPA CREATED THE

02:58:38.207 --> 02:58:40.009
CALIFORNIA PRIVACY PROTECTION

02:58:40.076 --> 02:58:42.011
AGENCY, WHO THEN THEY HAVE

02:58:42.078 --> 02:58:43.913
ISSUED OVER 150 PAGES OF

02:58:43.979 --> 02:58:46.082
DETAILED REGULATIONS AND GAVE

02:58:46.148 --> 02:58:47.083
ENFORCEMENT POWER TO THE

02:58:47.149 --> 02:58:48.918
ATTORNEY TO THE ATTORNEY

02:58:48.984 --> 02:58:50.319
GENERAL. THESE LAWSUITS AREN'T

02:58:50.386 --> 02:58:52.922
ABOUT PROTECTING PRIVACY.

02:58:52.988 --> 02:58:55.091
PRIVACY. PRIVACY. THEY'RE ABOUT

02:58:55.157 --> 02:58:57.326
EXPLOITING A 60 YEAR OLD LAW TO

02:58:57.393 --> 02:59:00.129
CASH IN. I'VE SUPPORTED

02:59:00.196 --> 02:59:02.064
STRENGTHENING THE CCPA. IN FACT,

02:59:02.131 --> 02:59:06.502
IN 2023, I VOTED FOR AB 1194,

02:59:06.569 --> 02:59:08.137
WHICH ADDED PROTECTIONS FOR

02:59:08.204 --> 02:59:10.639
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH, SUING UNDER

02:59:10.706 --> 02:59:12.274
CIPA FOR ACTIVITY THAT'S ALREADY

02:59:12.341 --> 02:59:14.076
GOVERNED BY THE CCPA, GOES

02:59:14.143 --> 02:59:15.845
AGAINST LEGISLATIVE INTENT,

02:59:15.911 --> 02:59:17.780
CREATES CONFUSION, PUNISHES

02:59:17.847 --> 02:59:19.315
COMPLIANCE, AND DOESN'T MAKE

02:59:19.381 --> 02:59:20.916
CALIFORNIANS ANY SAFER. A

02:59:20.983 --> 02:59:22.184
PRIVATE SETTLEMENT DOESN'T

02:59:22.251 --> 02:59:24.019
CREATE STRONGER PROTECTIONS FOR

02:59:24.086 --> 02:59:25.488
CONSUMERS OR CLEARER RULES FOR

02:59:25.554 --> 02:59:28.257
BUSINESS. IT JUST ENDS ONE CASE.

02:59:28.324 --> 02:59:29.692
I'D LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR AND

02:59:29.758 --> 02:59:30.893
THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR

02:59:30.960 --> 02:59:32.895
CONSIDERATION OF THIS IMPORTANT

02:59:32.962 --> 02:59:34.130
LEGISLATION. WE'VE HAD A NUMBER

02:59:34.196 --> 02:59:35.798
OF CONVERSATIONS. I REALLY

02:59:35.865 --> 02:59:37.266
APPRECIATE THAT. THE AMENDMENTS

02:59:37.333 --> 02:59:38.767
I PROPOSED WOULD HAVE NARROWED

02:59:38.834 --> 02:59:40.469
THE FOCUS OF THE BILL. THE

02:59:40.536 --> 02:59:41.904
CHANGE WOULD HAVE CREATED A

02:59:41.971 --> 02:59:43.372
REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION IN CIPA

02:59:43.439 --> 02:59:44.807
THAT COULD BE OVERCOME THROUGH

02:59:44.874 --> 02:59:47.309
PROOF OF HARM. HOWEVER, THERE

02:59:47.376 --> 02:59:49.145
ARE OUTSTANDING CONCERNS

02:59:49.211 --> 02:59:51.147
SURROUNDING CONSUMER PRIVACY,

02:59:51.213 --> 02:59:52.615
WHICH IS WHY I ASKED THAT THE

02:59:52.681 --> 02:59:54.250
BILL MOVE FORWARD TODAY, AND I

02:59:54.316 --> 02:59:56.085
INTEND TO MAKE IT A TWO YEAR

02:59:56.152 --> 02:59:57.887
BILL IN THE IN THE ASSEMBLY

02:59:57.953 --> 02:59:59.455
PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION

02:59:59.522 --> 03:00:00.956
COMMITTEE. THIS WILL ALLOW US

03:00:01.023 --> 03:00:02.324
ADDITIONAL TIME TO WORK WITH

03:00:02.391 --> 03:00:03.792
OPPOSITION AND TO ENSURE WE

03:00:03.859 --> 03:00:05.794
STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE,

03:00:05.861 --> 03:00:07.029
PUTTING AN END TO ABUSIVE

03:00:07.096 --> 03:00:10.032
LAWSUITS WHILE PRESERVING STRONG

03:00:10.099 --> 03:00:12.067
CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AGAINST

03:00:12.134 --> 03:00:14.303
TRUE BAD ACTORS. AND THESE ARE

03:00:14.370 --> 03:00:21.076
THE ENTITIES, THE COMPANIES THAT

03:00:21.143 --> 03:00:25.281
CREATE THE MODEL THAT AND

03:00:25.347 --> 03:00:29.852
SECRETLY HIDE IN THEIR NETWORK.

03:00:29.919 --> 03:00:32.621
I'M TRYING NOT TO USE NAMES HERE

03:00:32.688 --> 03:00:34.623
THAT ALLOWS SPYING. UNBEKNOWNST

03:00:34.690 --> 03:00:36.525
TO THE CONSUMER AND UNBEKNOWNST

03:00:36.592 --> 03:00:38.694
TO THE SMALL BUSINESS OR THE

03:00:38.761 --> 03:00:40.396
NONPROFIT OR THE LARGER BUSINESS

03:00:40.462 --> 03:00:42.331
THAT MAY BUY THEIR PRODUCTS. SO

03:00:42.398 --> 03:00:43.832
WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN

03:00:43.899 --> 03:00:46.368
SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS CHRIS AND

03:00:46.435 --> 03:00:48.170
ANGIE TERRY, PRESIDENT AND CEO

03:00:48.237 --> 03:00:49.838

THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO

STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR

03:01:22.504 --> 03:01:25.541
SENATE BILL 690. SB 690

03:01:25.608 --> 03:01:27.042
ADDRESSES A SURGE OF THOUSANDS

03:01:27.109 --> 03:01:29.612

03:01:29.678 --> 03:01:32.781

03:01:34.550 --> 03:01:36.018
ACTIVITIES THAT ARE ALREADY

03:01:36.085 --> 03:01:37.453
REGULATED BY THE CALIFORNIA

CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT, OR CCPA.

03:01:40.256 --> 03:01:41.991
THE COLLECTION OF IP ADDRESSES

03:01:42.057 --> 03:01:43.592
IS A ROUTINE BUSINESS PRACTICE

03:01:43.659 --> 03:01:44.893
AND IN OUR CASE, SUPPORTS THE

03:01:44.960 --> 03:01:46.762
LOS ANGELES TIMES ADVERTISING

03:01:46.829 --> 03:01:49.365

03:01:49.431 --> 03:01:52.167
THE LAW WE THOUGHT WE WERE

03:01:52.234 --> 03:01:52.835
SUPPOSED TO BE FOLLOWING. WE NOW

03:01:52.901 --> 03:01:54.737
FACE AN EXTORTIONIST LAWSUIT

03:01:54.803 --> 03:01:57.006
UNDER CPA, AND THE STAKES OF

03:01:57.072 --> 03:01:59.041
THIS MATTER ARE EXTREMELY HIGH.

03:01:59.108 --> 03:02:00.943
IT'S NOT ABOUT LOST PROFITS.

03:02:01.010 --> 03:02:02.678
IT'S TRULY ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO

03:02:02.745 --> 03:02:04.079
SURVIVE. AND WHILE THE

03:02:04.146 --> 03:02:06.181
COLLECTION OF IP ADDRESSES IS

03:02:06.248 --> 03:02:07.683
CERTAINLY NOT A PUBLIC SAFETY

03:02:07.750 --> 03:02:09.184

03:02:21.330 --> 03:02:23.165

03:02:25.668 --> 03:02:26.468
THE LAW DRAFTED DECADES BEFORE

03:02:26.535 --> 03:02:30.372

CURRENT LAWSUITS. PLAINTIFFS

03:02:45.120 --> 03:02:47.389
CLAIM THAT EVERY TIME A WEBSITE

03:02:53.429 --> 03:02:54.997

NEWS ORGANIZATIONS, JUST THE

03:03:03.439 --> 03:03:05.641
COST TO DEFEND THESE SUITS IS

03:03:05.708 --> 03:03:07.643
CATASTROPHIC. IF THIS CONTINUES,

03:03:07.710 --> 03:03:09.611
IT WILL DEVASTATE THE VERY

03:03:09.678 --> 03:03:10.913
PUBLISHERS THAT KEEP

HAVE BEEN FILED UNDER THIS

03:03:21.623 --> 03:03:23.492
THEORY, AND WHILE WE BELIEVE

03:03:23.559 --> 03:03:24.760
THEY'RE MERITLESS, FEDERAL

03:03:24.827 --> 03:03:26.195
COURTS ARE WAITING FOR

03:03:26.261 --> 03:03:28.330
LEGISLATIVE CLARITY. SB 690

03:03:28.397 --> 03:03:30.499
PROVIDES THAT CLARITY. WHEN A

RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO MOVE SB

UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNT OF BUSINESS

THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHRIS.

03:03:53.856 --> 03:03:55.591
THANK YOU, SENATOR CHAIR,

03:03:55.657 --> 03:03:58.327
MEMBERS, FOR HEARING THIS. MY

03:03:58.394 --> 03:04:00.696
NAME IS BRANDON RILEY. I'M A

03:04:00.763 --> 03:04:01.530
PARTNER AT MANATT, PHELPS AND

03:04:01.597 --> 03:04:02.097
PHILLIPS, WHERE I LEAD THE

03:04:02.164 --> 03:04:03.732
PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY GROUP

03:04:03.799 --> 03:04:04.900
AT THAT FIRM. MY FIRM HAS

03:04:04.967 --> 03:04:07.536
HANDLED OVER 100 LAWSUITS. WE'RE

03:04:07.603 --> 03:04:09.738
CURRENTLY HANDLING OVER TWO

03:04:09.805 --> 03:04:11.874
DOZEN. I JUST GOT ONE ON MY

03:04:11.940 --> 03:04:13.275
PHONE AS I WAS SITTING HERE

03:04:13.342 --> 03:04:14.376
WAITING. THAT'S HOW PROLIFIC

03:04:14.443 --> 03:04:18.080
THIS IS. CPA WAS WRITTEN IN

03:04:18.147 --> 03:04:19.648
1967, LONG BEFORE THE INTERNET.

03:04:19.715 --> 03:04:21.550
IT DOES NOT ADDRESS WEBSITE

03:04:21.617 --> 03:04:23.152
TECHNOLOGY OR PRIVACY. COURTS

03:04:23.218 --> 03:04:24.653
REMAIN DIVIDED ON HOW IT

03:04:24.720 --> 03:04:26.622
APPLIES, AND TRIAL ATTORNEYS

03:04:26.688 --> 03:04:28.357
EXPLOIT THIS UNCERTAINTY BY

03:04:28.424 --> 03:04:29.992
SENDING DEMAND LETTERS TO ANYONE

03:04:30.058 --> 03:04:31.994
WHO OWNS A WEBSITE AND

03:04:32.060 --> 03:04:33.128
PRESSURING THEM INTO SETTLEMENTS

03:04:33.195 --> 03:04:34.797
THAT COST SLIGHTLY LESS THAN

03:04:34.863 --> 03:04:37.099
DEFENDING THEM IN COURT. NOT A

03:04:37.166 --> 03:04:38.934
SINGLE ONE OF THE LAWSUITS THAT

03:04:39.001 --> 03:04:39.868
I'VE DEALT WITH HAS MEANINGFULLY

03:04:39.935 --> 03:04:42.004
ADVANCED PRIVACY PROTECTIONS.

03:04:42.070 --> 03:04:44.173
BUT CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS A LAW

03:04:44.239 --> 03:04:46.108
THAT DOES THAT. THE CALIFORNIA

03:04:46.175 --> 03:04:48.544
CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT. THE CCPA.

03:04:48.610 --> 03:04:50.012
SINCE ITS PASSAGE SEVEN YEARS

03:04:50.078 --> 03:04:51.580
AGO, I'VE ADVISED HUNDREDS OF

03:04:51.647 --> 03:04:54.149
COMPANIES ON CCPA COMPLIANCE. IT

03:04:54.216 --> 03:04:55.851
CLEARLY REGULATES THE VERY

03:04:55.918 --> 03:04:57.986
CONDUCT THAT THAT OPPONENTS

03:04:58.053 --> 03:05:00.456
CLAIM CPA COVERS. MOREOVER, THE

03:05:00.522 --> 03:05:01.890
CCPA IS THE LAW THAT HAS

03:05:01.957 --> 03:05:03.492
STRENGTHENED PROTECTION FOR

03:05:03.559 --> 03:05:05.060
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH DATA,

03:05:05.127 --> 03:05:06.128
IMMIGRATION DATA, AND OTHER

03:05:06.195 --> 03:05:08.764
PRIVACY CONCERNS. THE PRIVACY

03:05:08.831 --> 03:05:09.965
AGENCY CHARGED WITH ENFORCING

03:05:10.032 --> 03:05:11.600
THIS LAW IS ALSO SPONSORING A

03:05:11.667 --> 03:05:12.768
BILL TO STRENGTHEN CONSUMERS

03:05:12.835 --> 03:05:14.436
RIGHTS TO PREVENT DATA FROM

03:05:14.503 --> 03:05:17.473
BEING SOLD OR SHARED. TO BE

03:05:17.539 --> 03:05:18.774
CLEAR, THE CCPA REGULATES THE

03:05:18.841 --> 03:05:20.976
USE OF THIRD PARTY TRACKERS ON

03:05:21.043 --> 03:05:22.444
WEBSITES. BY CONSIDERING THIS

03:05:22.511 --> 03:05:24.546
ACTIVITY, A QUOTE SALE BY THE

03:05:24.613 --> 03:05:26.315
WEBSITE TO THE COMPANY THAT

03:05:26.381 --> 03:05:28.217
PLACES THE TRACKER. THIS IS WHAT

03:05:28.283 --> 03:05:29.618
THE CCPA DOES. THIS IS THE VERY

03:05:29.685 --> 03:05:31.553
TYPE OF ACTIVITY THAT IS NOW

03:05:31.620 --> 03:05:32.621
ENFORCED BY CALIFORNIA

03:05:32.688 --> 03:05:33.822
REGULATORS. I'D BE HAPPY TO WALK

03:05:33.889 --> 03:05:36.325
THROUGH THE DETAILS WITH ANY

03:05:36.391 --> 03:05:36.925
MEMBER ABOUT THIS. THESE LAWS

03:05:36.992 --> 03:05:38.293
ARE BEING ACTIVELY ENFORCED BY

03:05:38.360 --> 03:05:40.062
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE

03:05:40.128 --> 03:05:42.130

03:05:42.197 --> 03:05:43.765
PRIVACY PROTECTION AGENCY.

03:05:43.832 --> 03:05:45.133
RECENT ACTIONS HAVE INCLUDED

03:05:45.200 --> 03:05:47.603
AGAINST AUTOMAKERS, RETAILERS,

03:05:47.669 --> 03:05:50.439
MOBILE APPS, AND DATA BROKERS.

03:05:50.506 --> 03:05:51.607
CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE PROUD OF

03:05:51.673 --> 03:05:53.008
ITS NATION LEADING PRIVACY LAWS.

03:05:53.075 --> 03:05:55.177
IT REALLY SHOULD. BUT THAT PRIDE

03:05:55.244 --> 03:05:56.345
SHOULDN'T EXTEND TO ATTORNEY

03:05:56.411 --> 03:05:58.847
MISUSE OF A 1967 PHONE

03:05:58.914 --> 03:06:01.717

03:06:01.783 --> 03:06:03.018
REINFORCE CALIFORNIA'S

THE FLOOD OF MERITLESS LAWSUITS.

03:06:06.788 --> 03:06:09.625
THE CCPA, NOT CPA, IS WHAT

PROTECTS CALIFORNIANS ONLINE. I

03:06:12.294 --> 03:06:12.961

03:07:35.844 --> 03:07:37.813
ALL VERY MUCH FOR VOICING YOUR

03:07:37.879 --> 03:07:38.914
OPINION ON OUR STATE CAPITOL.

03:07:38.981 --> 03:07:40.449
NEXT, WE'LL HEAR FROM ANY

03:07:40.515 --> 03:07:43.518
WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SIR, I

03:07:43.585 --> 03:07:44.453
APOLOGIZE. WHAT WAS YOUR LAST

03:07:44.519 --> 03:07:45.754
NAME AGAIN? ARGENT. ARGENT.

03:07:45.821 --> 03:07:47.222
TERRY, WOULD YOU MIND MOVING

03:07:47.289 --> 03:07:48.857
OVER ONE CHAIR? WE'RE GOING TO

03:07:48.924 --> 03:07:50.459
HAVE OPPOSITION WITNESSES. ONLY

03:07:50.525 --> 03:07:51.393
TWO OPPOSITION WITNESSES PER

03:07:51.460 --> 03:07:52.961
COMMITTEE RULES SIT IN THESE

03:07:53.028 --> 03:07:54.997
CHAIRS RIGHT HERE. ONCE YOU

03:07:55.063 --> 03:07:56.198
BEGIN SPEAKING, YOU'LL HAVE A

03:07:56.264 --> 03:07:58.033
COMBINED TOTAL TIME OF FIVE

03:07:58.100 --> 03:07:58.800
MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE

03:07:58.867 --> 03:08:01.503
COMMITTEE. AND THE FLOOR IS

03:08:01.570 --> 03:08:07.609
YOURS WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.

03:08:07.676 --> 03:08:10.112
GOOD AFTERNOON, MR. CHAIR AND

03:08:10.178 --> 03:08:11.713
MEMBERS. I'M JUANA CHÃVEZ FROM

03:08:11.780 --> 03:08:14.016
THE DOLORES HUERTA FOUNDATION,

03:08:14.082 --> 03:08:15.884
AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF MY

03:08:15.951 --> 03:08:18.220
MOTHER, DOLORES HUERTA, IN

03:08:18.286 --> 03:08:20.956
OPPOSITION TO SENATE BILL 690.

03:08:21.023 --> 03:08:23.158
MY MOTHER HAS SPENT HER ENTIRE

03:08:23.225 --> 03:08:24.326
LIFE FIGHTING FOR THE RIGHTS OF

03:08:24.393 --> 03:08:27.029
ALL PEOPLE, OFTENTIMES AGAINST

03:08:27.095 --> 03:08:27.963
CORPORATIONS THAT CARE MORE

03:08:28.030 --> 03:08:30.265
ABOUT PROFITS THAN PEOPLE. THIS

03:08:30.332 --> 03:08:32.534
BILL IS LIKE SO MANY OF THOSE

03:08:32.601 --> 03:08:35.070
FIGHTS. SINCE SB 690 IS ABOUT

03:08:35.137 --> 03:08:37.606
LETTING COMPANIES AND BIG TECH

03:08:37.673 --> 03:08:40.075
SPY ON US AND SURVEIL US WITHOUT

03:08:40.142 --> 03:08:42.177
ALMOST ANY LIMITS WHATSOEVER,

03:08:42.244 --> 03:08:44.713
THIS BILL IS WRONG, MISGUIDED,

03:08:44.780 --> 03:08:47.783
AND EXTREMELY POORLY DRAFTED.

03:08:47.849 --> 03:08:50.485
DOLORES HUERTA URGES A NO ON SB

03:08:50.552 --> 03:08:52.320
690 BECAUSE IT WOULD ALLOW

03:08:52.387 --> 03:08:53.622
TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES TO COLLECT

03:08:53.689 --> 03:08:55.590
SENSITIVE DATA SUCH AS

03:08:55.657 --> 03:08:57.192
IMMIGRATION STATUS, REPRODUCTIVE

03:08:57.259 --> 03:08:59.127
HEALTH CARE, SORT AND

03:08:59.194 --> 03:09:00.996
INDIVIDUAL'S PHYSICAL LOCATION.

03:09:01.063 --> 03:09:02.698
THIS INFORMATION COULD THEN BE

03:09:02.764 --> 03:09:04.466
SOLD AND SHARED WITH THIRD

03:09:04.533 --> 03:09:06.001
PARTIES, INCLUDING FEDERAL

03:09:06.068 --> 03:09:08.870
AGENCIES LIKE ICE. WHAT WE ARE

03:09:08.937 --> 03:09:10.338
SEEING TODAY WITH FEDERAL

03:09:10.405 --> 03:09:11.707
ENFORCEMENT ENFORCEMENT IS JUST

03:09:11.773 --> 03:09:14.576
THE START. WE ARE WITNESSING THE

03:09:14.643 --> 03:09:16.144
CRIMINALIZATION OF PEOPLE

03:09:16.211 --> 03:09:17.546
SEEKING OR PROVIDING ABORTION

03:09:17.612 --> 03:09:19.581
CARE. WE ALSO KNOW THE TRUMP

03:09:19.648 --> 03:09:20.749
ADMINISTRATION WANTS THE

03:09:20.816 --> 03:09:22.084
SENSITIVE INFORMATION OF

03:09:22.150 --> 03:09:24.052
IMMIGRANTS, AND THAT'S WHY HE IS

03:09:24.119 --> 03:09:26.488
AFTER MEDICARE AND IRS

03:09:26.555 --> 03:09:29.424
INFORMATION OF IMMIGRANTS. SB

03:09:29.491 --> 03:09:30.826
690 GIVES THEM ANOTHER AVENUE

03:09:30.892 --> 03:09:33.995
THAT HE WILL ABUSE. THIS BILL

03:09:34.062 --> 03:09:35.797
WOULD LEAVE MANY CALIFORNIANS,

03:09:35.864 --> 03:09:37.733
PARTICULARLY THE COMMUNITIES

03:09:37.799 --> 03:09:39.501
DOLORES HAS SPENT HER LIFE

03:09:39.568 --> 03:09:42.003
ORGANIZING ALONGSIDE VULNERABLE,

03:09:42.070 --> 03:09:44.172
EXPOSED, AND LIVING IN CONSTANT

03:09:44.239 --> 03:09:46.074
FEAR. THIS IS NOT THE CALIFORNIA

03:09:46.141 --> 03:09:48.477
THAT SHE HAS FOUGHT FOR. INSTEAD

03:09:48.543 --> 03:09:50.212
OF FURTHER MARGINALIZING THESE

03:09:50.278 --> 03:09:51.513
GROUPS, WE SHOULD WORK TO

03:09:51.580 --> 03:09:52.414
PROTECT AND STRENGTHEN THEIR

03:09:52.481 --> 03:09:55.383
RIGHT TO PRIVACY. SB 690 DOES

03:09:55.450 --> 03:09:57.819
THE OPPOSITE AND INSTEAD GRANTS

03:09:57.886 --> 03:09:59.788
POWER TO THOSE WHO SEEK TO HARM

03:09:59.855 --> 03:10:02.190
THE COMMUNITIES WE HOLD MOST

03:10:02.257 --> 03:10:03.892
DEAR. FOR THESE REASONS, AND

03:10:03.959 --> 03:10:06.428
MANY OTHERS, I RESPECTFULLY, ON

03:10:06.495 --> 03:10:09.731
BEHALF OF MY MOTHER, DOLORES

03:10:09.798 --> 03:10:12.267
HUERTA, URGE A NO ON SB 690.

03:10:12.334 --> 03:10:13.869
THANK YOU. MY NAME IS LÂ®NG LÃ

03:10:13.935 --> 03:10:16.138
AND I'M A POLICY ADVOCATE FOR AJ

03:10:16.204 --> 03:10:17.672
SOCAL, AND FOR MANY YEARS I'VE

03:10:17.739 --> 03:10:19.107
WORKED DIRECTLY WITH SURVIVORS

03:10:19.174 --> 03:10:21.243
OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, HUMAN

03:10:21.309 --> 03:10:22.978
TRAFFICKING, AND SEXUAL ASSAULT.

03:10:23.044 --> 03:10:24.646
I'VE SEEN HOW HARD SURVIVORS

03:10:24.713 --> 03:10:25.947
HAVE TO FIGHT TO REGAIN CONTROL

03:10:26.014 --> 03:10:28.683
OF THEIR BODIES, THEIR CHOICES,

03:10:28.750 --> 03:10:30.852
AND PERSONAL INFORMATION. AND

03:10:30.919 --> 03:10:32.754
THAT IS WHY I ASK YOU TO VOTE

03:10:32.821 --> 03:10:35.891
AGAINST SB 690 TODAY. FOR MANY

03:10:35.957 --> 03:10:38.593
SURVIVORS, DIGITAL TOOLS ARE

03:10:38.660 --> 03:10:39.928
LIFELINES. THEY SEARCH FOR

03:10:39.995 --> 03:10:41.196
SHELTERS, EMAIL ADVOCATES, LOOK

03:10:41.263 --> 03:10:44.199
UP MEDICAL CARE. BUT UNDER THIS

03:10:44.266 --> 03:10:45.700
BILL, THOSE LIFELINES COULD BE

03:10:45.767 --> 03:10:48.303
TURNED AGAINST THEM. THERE. THAT

03:10:48.370 --> 03:10:50.238
PRIVATE SEARCH FOR HELP COULD BE

03:10:50.305 --> 03:10:51.606
RECORDED. THEIR LOCATE DATA

03:10:51.673 --> 03:10:53.475
TRACKED, THEIR MESSAGES FLAGGED,

03:10:53.542 --> 03:10:55.644
STORED AND SHARED, OFTEN WITHOUT

03:10:55.710 --> 03:10:57.779
THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND CONSENT.

03:10:57.846 --> 03:10:59.881
THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT DATA

03:10:59.948 --> 03:11:01.650
PRIVACY. THIS IS ABOUT SAFETY.

03:11:01.716 --> 03:11:04.553
AND SAFETY CANNOT EXIST WITHOUT

03:11:04.619 --> 03:11:06.655
CONSENT. IT CANNOT EXIST WHEN

03:11:06.721 --> 03:11:08.657
PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO SEEK HELP

03:11:08.723 --> 03:11:10.258
OR SEARCH FOR SUPPORT BECAUSE

03:11:10.325 --> 03:11:13.595
THEY DON'T KNOW WHO IS WATCHING

03:11:13.662 --> 03:11:14.963
AND HOW THAT INFORMATION COULD

03:11:15.030 --> 03:11:18.133
BE USED OR EXPOSED. MINIMIZING

03:11:18.200 --> 03:11:19.734
THE DATA COMPANIES COLLECT IS

03:11:19.801 --> 03:11:21.169
ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL

03:11:21.236 --> 03:11:23.338
SAFEGUARDS THAT WE HAVE. WHEN WE

03:11:23.405 --> 03:11:25.073
LIMIT WHAT COMPANIES CAN GATHER,

03:11:25.140 --> 03:11:27.542
WE LIMIT WHAT CAN BE EXPLOITED,

03:11:27.609 --> 03:11:29.411
STOPPING HARM BEFORE IT STARTS.

03:11:29.477 --> 03:11:31.613
THE TRUE COST OF THIS BILL GOES

03:11:31.680 --> 03:11:34.182
BEYOND LAWSUITS AND DOLLARS. IT

03:11:34.249 --> 03:11:35.650
WILL ALSO BE FELT IN THE LIVES

03:11:35.717 --> 03:11:38.820
THAT HAVE BEEN UPENDED, HEALING

03:11:38.887 --> 03:11:39.955
INTERRUPTED AND THE SAFETY THAT

03:11:40.021 --> 03:11:42.357
IS LOST, ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE

03:11:42.424 --> 03:11:44.860
WHO ARE ALREADY IN THE MARGINS,

03:11:44.926 --> 03:11:46.862
INCLUDING IMMIGRANTS, STUDENTS

03:11:46.928 --> 03:11:49.397
AND THE LGBTQ. PLUS INDIVIDUALS

03:11:49.464 --> 03:11:51.733
IN YOUR DISTRICTS, MANY OF WHOM

03:11:51.800 --> 03:11:54.970
ARE LIVING IN FEAR. AS BOTH AN

03:11:55.036 --> 03:11:57.205
ADVOCATE AND A SURVIVOR, I ASK

03:11:57.272 --> 03:12:00.108
YOU NOT TO VOTE FOR SB 690, NOT

03:12:00.175 --> 03:12:02.844
JUST TO REJECT THE POLICY, BUT

03:12:02.911 --> 03:12:04.312
TO AFFIRM THAT EVERY PERSON

03:12:04.379 --> 03:12:06.147
SHOULD FEEL SAFE WHEN SEEKING

03:12:06.214 --> 03:12:08.884
HELP AND THAT THEIR LIVES ARE

03:12:08.950 --> 03:12:13.355
WORTH PROTECTING. THANK YOU.

03:12:13.421 --> 03:12:14.155

MR. GONZALEZ THANK YOU, MR.

03:16:15.797 --> 03:16:17.098
CHAIR. I KNOW WE SPENT MANY

03:16:17.165 --> 03:16:18.666
HOURS CHATTING ABOUT THIS AND AS

03:16:18.733 --> 03:16:21.169
WELL AS WITH THE AUTHOR AS WELL.

03:16:21.236 --> 03:16:22.270
AND FOLKS, JUST TO GET TO THIS

03:16:22.337 --> 03:16:24.272
POINT. SO I JUST WANT TO THANK

03:16:24.339 --> 03:16:25.140
THE AUTHOR, THE FOUNDATION, THE

03:16:25.206 --> 03:16:26.808
WORK, THE FAMILY I'VE KNOWN FOR

03:16:26.875 --> 03:16:28.510
YEARS AND EVERYONE COMING HERE

03:16:28.576 --> 03:16:29.744
TO TESTIFY ON THIS BILL TODAY. I

03:16:29.811 --> 03:16:31.546
DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE

03:16:31.613 --> 03:16:32.981
CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAD ABOUT

03:16:33.047 --> 03:16:34.349
THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE FACING,

03:16:34.415 --> 03:16:35.850
PARTICULARLY SMALL BUSINESSES

03:16:35.917 --> 03:16:37.886
OWNERS WITH THESE FRIVOLOUS

03:16:37.952 --> 03:16:40.088
LITIGATIONS AND LAWSUITS. AND,

03:16:40.155 --> 03:16:41.890
YOU KNOW, UTILIZING AND

03:16:41.956 --> 03:16:43.491
UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE BAD

03:16:43.558 --> 03:16:45.226
ACTORS AND THERE ARE THOSE WHO

03:16:45.293 --> 03:16:46.394
ARE EXPLOITING OUR LEGAL SYSTEM

03:16:46.461 --> 03:16:48.429
AS A RESULT OF THIS, I ALSO WANT

03:16:48.496 --> 03:16:49.864
TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THOSE WHO

03:16:49.931 --> 03:16:52.267
ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL

03:16:52.333 --> 03:16:53.134
THAT I HEAR YOU, I'M THE

03:16:53.201 --> 03:16:54.569
EPICENTER, AS THE SENATOR WERE

03:16:54.636 --> 03:16:56.304
DISCUSSING ABOUT MY DISTRICT,

03:16:56.371 --> 03:16:57.472
WITH BUSINESS, WITH NONPROFITS,

03:16:57.539 --> 03:16:59.908
WITH LABOR GROUPS FOR THIS. AND

03:16:59.974 --> 03:17:01.609
SO, YOU KNOW, THIS CONVERSATION

03:17:01.676 --> 03:17:03.611
DOES NEED TO BE CONTINUED, BUT

03:17:03.678 --> 03:17:05.747
THAT PRIVATE DATA COULD BE

03:17:05.813 --> 03:17:06.948
MISUSED. AND THOSE CONCERNS ARE

03:17:07.015 --> 03:17:09.317
ARE VALID AND THEY'RE DEEPLY

03:17:09.384 --> 03:17:11.753
PERSONAL FOR US AND FOR ME. AND

03:17:11.819 --> 03:17:13.221
LOOK, I THINK AS A MEMBER AND IT

03:17:13.288 --> 03:17:14.389
WAS MENTIONED ABOUT THE LGBT

03:17:14.455 --> 03:17:15.757
CAUCUS, LATINO CAUCUS AND

03:17:15.823 --> 03:17:16.891
SOMEONE WHO REPRESENTS A

03:17:16.958 --> 03:17:18.560
DISTRICT, AS IT'S BEEN IN THE

03:17:18.626 --> 03:17:19.694
NEWS THAT HAS DIRECTLY BEEN

03:17:19.761 --> 03:17:22.630
IMPACTED BY ICE. MANY OF THOSE

03:17:22.697 --> 03:17:23.698
CONVERSATIONS, THERE ARE FOLKS

03:17:23.765 --> 03:17:26.267
WHO ARE FEARFUL OF USING ONLINE

03:17:26.334 --> 03:17:27.735
TOOLS TO SEARCH KNOW YOUR RIGHTS

03:17:27.802 --> 03:17:29.137
OR THROUGH CHIRLA. AND WE'RE

03:17:29.204 --> 03:17:31.306
GOING TO WHO ARE AFRAID THAT

03:17:31.372 --> 03:17:32.207
BECAUSE OF THAT, THOSE SEARCHES

03:17:32.273 --> 03:17:34.509
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE THEN

03:17:34.576 --> 03:17:36.978
FLAGGED. AND THAT'S CONCERNING.

03:17:37.045 --> 03:17:38.980
IT'S NOT HYPOTHETICAL, IT'S

03:17:39.047 --> 03:17:41.015
REAL. AND SO PUTTING THAT SORT

03:17:41.082 --> 03:17:42.750
OF INFORMATION IN THE WRONG

03:17:42.817 --> 03:17:44.719
HANDS IS GOING TO CREATE WHAT WE

03:17:44.786 --> 03:17:46.821
KNOW AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING

03:17:46.888 --> 03:17:48.289
NATIONALLY. MORE ISSUES FOR

03:17:48.356 --> 03:17:49.924
LATINO COMMUNITY AS WELL. BUT I

03:17:49.991 --> 03:17:52.260
DO KNOW THAT THE AUTHOR IS NOT

03:17:52.327 --> 03:17:53.127
INTENDING FOR THIS BILL TO

03:17:53.194 --> 03:17:54.295
TARGET THOSE COMMUNITIES AT ALL.

03:17:54.362 --> 03:17:56.064
THAT WAS NEVER THE INTENTION OF

03:17:56.130 --> 03:17:57.799
THIS BILL, BUT ITS UNINTENDED

03:17:57.865 --> 03:17:59.100
CONSEQUENCES COULD LEAD TO

03:17:59.167 --> 03:18:00.101
EXPERIENCING HARM, WHICH WAS IN

03:18:00.168 --> 03:18:02.637
YOUR YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY. SO

03:18:02.704 --> 03:18:03.938
LOOK, I BUT I TRUST THE AUTHOR.

03:18:04.005 --> 03:18:06.541
I KNOW THAT THAT YOU WOULD NEVER

03:18:06.608 --> 03:18:07.775
DO THAT. AND WE HAD ANOTHER

03:18:07.842 --> 03:18:08.676
CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT. AND

03:18:08.743 --> 03:18:10.545
THAT'S VERY CLEAR THAT YOU WILL

03:18:10.612 --> 03:18:12.046
WANT TO WORK ON THESE AS WE NEXT

03:18:12.113 --> 03:18:13.815
COUPLE OF YEARS TO MAKE THIS

03:18:13.881 --> 03:18:15.149
RIGHT. AND ESPECIALLY WITH THIS

03:18:15.216 --> 03:18:16.217
ADMINISTRATION, WE DON'T KNOW

03:18:16.284 --> 03:18:18.319
WHAT TO EXPECT TOMORROW. BUT

03:18:18.386 --> 03:18:20.154
LOOK, I THINK WITH YOU AND I AND

03:18:20.221 --> 03:18:21.689
WITH THE MY COLLEAGUES HERE

03:18:21.756 --> 03:18:22.924
TODAY, THAT IT'S A CALL TO

03:18:22.991 --> 03:18:24.892
ACTION TO LISTEN TO THOSE WHO

03:18:24.959 --> 03:18:25.960
KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE IN

03:18:26.027 --> 03:18:28.329
THOSE SHADOWS. AND SO, YOU KNOW,

03:18:28.396 --> 03:18:30.565
FOR US AND THOSE OF US WHO ARE

03:18:30.632 --> 03:18:32.066
HERE, THAT TRUE JUSTICE ISN'T

03:18:32.133 --> 03:18:32.934
ABOUT CHOOSING BETWEEN

03:18:33.001 --> 03:18:33.568
COMMUNITIES. IT'S ABOUT LIFTING

03:18:33.635 --> 03:18:35.003
THEM UP. AND THAT'S THE GOAL OF

03:18:35.069 --> 03:18:37.005
THIS BILL. SO I THANK YOU FOR

03:18:37.071 --> 03:18:38.906
BRINGING THIS UP TODAY. I WILL

03:18:38.973 --> 03:18:40.742
SUPPORT IT BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN SO

03:18:40.808 --> 03:18:42.877
OPEN ON THAT DIALOG WITH YOU AND

03:18:42.944 --> 03:18:44.078
WITH THE CHAIR, MY COLLEAGUES AS

03:18:44.145 --> 03:18:46.547
WELL. SO THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR

03:18:46.614 --> 03:18:47.248
FOR WORKING ON THIS TOGETHER.

03:18:47.315 --> 03:18:49.684
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU.

03:18:49.751 --> 03:18:51.786
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ, WOULD

03:18:51.853 --> 03:18:54.722
ANYONE LIKE TO GO NEXT? VICE

03:18:54.789 --> 03:18:57.225
CHAIR ALANIS, PLEASE? THANK YOU,

03:18:57.292 --> 03:19:00.962
MR. CHAIR. TO TELL YOU THE

03:19:01.029 --> 03:19:01.963
TRUTH, I WAS KIND OF THROWN OFF

03:19:02.030 --> 03:19:03.798
WITH ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT

03:19:03.865 --> 03:19:05.033
WERE COMING UP TODAY. I THOUGHT

03:19:05.099 --> 03:19:07.435
THIS WAS MOSTLY ABOUT

03:19:07.502 --> 03:19:08.069
ADVERTISEMENTS AND ME GOING TO

03:19:08.136 --> 03:19:09.804
THE STORE AND STUFF LIKE THAT. I

03:19:09.871 --> 03:19:13.141
DIDN'T KNOW ICE WAS BROUGHT INTO

03:19:13.207 --> 03:19:13.808
THIS OR EVERYTHING ELSE THAT HAD

03:19:13.875 --> 03:19:18.179
COME UP TODAY. HAVING SAID THAT,

03:19:18.246 --> 03:19:20.348
I STILL, AS MY COLLEAGUE HAD

03:19:20.415 --> 03:19:23.584
MENTIONED, ALSO BELIEVE IN THE

03:19:23.651 --> 03:19:24.852
AUTHOR AND KNOW THAT SHE KNOWS

03:19:24.919 --> 03:19:26.754
WHAT SHE'S DOING. AND I THINK

03:19:26.821 --> 03:19:28.089
THIS DOES HELP OUR BUSINESSES. I

03:19:28.156 --> 03:19:29.691
THINK THIS DOES HELP OTHER

03:19:29.757 --> 03:19:31.793
ISSUES THAT ARE GOING ON AS

03:19:31.859 --> 03:19:33.594
WELL. AND I WILL MOVE THE BILL.

03:19:33.661 --> 03:19:35.063
OKAY. ALL RIGHT. WE'LL CONTINUE

03:19:35.129 --> 03:19:36.197
WITH DISCUSSION. BUT I WILL NOTE

03:19:36.264 --> 03:19:37.899
WE HAVE A MOTION BY ALANIS, A

03:19:37.965 --> 03:19:40.034
SECOND BY LACKEY. ANYTHING ELSE,

03:19:40.101 --> 03:19:42.403
MR. VICE CHAIR? OKAY. ANYONE

03:19:42.470 --> 03:19:44.872
ELSE LIKE TO WEIGH IN ON IT, MR.

03:19:44.939 --> 03:19:45.873
LACKEY OR DOCTOR SHARPE? COLLINS

03:19:45.940 --> 03:19:49.410
OR MR. RAMOS? NO. ALL RIGHT,

03:19:49.477 --> 03:19:50.545
SENATOR CABALLERO, YOU'LL HAVE A

03:19:50.611 --> 03:19:52.513
CHANCE TO CLOSE, AND THEN I'LL

03:19:52.580 --> 03:19:53.114
GIVE MY RECOMMENDATION. THANK

03:19:53.181 --> 03:19:54.982
YOU VERY MUCH, MR. CHAIR. AND I

03:19:55.049 --> 03:19:55.917

03:19:55.983 --> 03:19:58.553
THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. LET ME ALSO

03:19:58.619 --> 03:20:00.021
THANK EVERYBODY FOR BEING HERE

03:20:00.088 --> 03:20:03.191
TODAY. THIS IS HOW WE GET THINGS

03:20:03.257 --> 03:20:05.126
DONE. IT'S HOW WE BE CAREFUL AND

03:20:05.193 --> 03:20:07.862
HOW WE MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER

03:20:07.929 --> 03:20:09.397
LEGISLATION WE PASS DOESN'T HURT

03:20:09.464 --> 03:20:11.466
THE VERY PEOPLE THAT WE CARE THE

03:20:11.532 --> 03:20:14.035
MOST ABOUT. SUFFICE IT TO BE

03:20:14.102 --> 03:20:16.170
SAID THAT THAT IT'S RARE FOR ME,

03:20:16.237 --> 03:20:17.905
AND I WANT TO SECOND WHAT THE

03:20:17.972 --> 03:20:19.841
CHAIR SAID ABOUT VOTING, VOTING

03:20:19.907 --> 03:20:21.442
YOUR CONSCIENCE AND VOTING YOUR

03:20:21.509 --> 03:20:25.513
DISTRICT. IT'S LONG BEEN MY.

03:20:25.580 --> 03:20:29.083
THAT'S HOW I SEE MY ROLE HERE AS

03:20:29.150 --> 03:20:31.919
WELL. IS THAT. FRANKLY, I DON'T

03:20:31.986 --> 03:20:33.454
APPRECIATE BEING THREATENED

03:20:33.521 --> 03:20:35.923
WITH, YOU KNOW, SCORECARDS. I

03:20:35.990 --> 03:20:37.825
KNOW THEY'RE IMPORTANT TO

03:20:37.892 --> 03:20:39.460
PEOPLE, BUT BUT IT'S IMPORTANT,

03:20:39.527 --> 03:20:40.995
I THINK, TO TRY TO GET THINGS

03:20:41.062 --> 03:20:43.765
RIGHT. NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO IS

03:20:43.831 --> 03:20:46.300
THAT HAVING SAID THAT, THE ONLY

03:20:46.367 --> 03:20:50.371
TWO, 100% THAT I'VE EVER GOTTEN

03:20:50.438 --> 03:20:52.039
YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR IS

03:20:52.106 --> 03:20:53.674
ONE PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND TWO

03:20:53.741 --> 03:20:55.443
IS EQUALITY CALIFORNIA. AND I'M

03:20:55.510 --> 03:20:58.212
VERY PROUD OF THOSE BECAUSE THEY

03:20:58.279 --> 03:21:00.381
ARE CORE BELIEFS THAT THAT I

03:21:00.448 --> 03:21:03.684
HAVE ABOUT ABOUT REPRODUCTIVE

03:21:03.751 --> 03:21:06.854
HEALTH CARE AND IMMIGRATION. LET

03:21:06.921 --> 03:21:09.657
ME JUST SAY THAT PART OF THE

03:21:09.724 --> 03:21:14.128
CHALLENGE WITH THESE LAWSUITS IS

03:21:14.195 --> 03:21:17.265
THAT THEY'VE REALLY TARGETED.

03:21:17.331 --> 03:21:19.066
IT'S NOT JUST BIG BUSINESSES,

03:21:19.133 --> 03:21:21.569
IT'S BIG BUSINESSES, SMALL

03:21:21.636 --> 03:21:25.206
BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS. AND

03:21:25.273 --> 03:21:26.641
FOR THE MOST PART, THE TOOLS

03:21:26.707 --> 03:21:27.809
THAT THEY'RE USING ARE TOOLS

03:21:27.875 --> 03:21:29.811
THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED BY

03:21:29.877 --> 03:21:32.246
SOMEONE ELSE, BY ANOTHER ENTITY.

03:21:32.313 --> 03:21:34.749
WE ALL HAVE WEB PAGES, AND IF

03:21:34.816 --> 03:21:36.751
OUR WEB PAGES GET ATTACKED

03:21:36.818 --> 03:21:38.553
BECAUSE THEY'RE COLLECTING

03:21:38.619 --> 03:21:39.921
INFORMATION, WHICH ALL OF OUR

03:21:39.987 --> 03:21:41.556
WEB PAGES DO, RIGHT? WHO SHOWED

03:21:41.622 --> 03:21:43.724
UP, WHO CAME IN, HOW LONG DID

03:21:43.791 --> 03:21:45.827
THEY COME IN? WHAT ARE THEY

03:21:45.893 --> 03:21:49.197
LOOKING AT? IT'S DATA. THEN.

03:21:49.263 --> 03:21:52.200
THEN WE'RE ALL LIABLE. WE'RE ALL

03:21:52.266 --> 03:21:54.702
WE'RE WE'RE ALL POTENTIAL

03:21:54.769 --> 03:21:56.838
TARGETS OF THESE LAWSUITS. AND

03:21:56.904 --> 03:22:01.008
SO THE QUESTION IS, CAN YOU

03:22:01.075 --> 03:22:04.779
BOOTSTRAP A HIPAA? CLAIM AND

03:22:04.846 --> 03:22:07.615
THEN END UP IN COURT, LIKE IT OR

03:22:07.682 --> 03:22:09.917
NOT, DEFENDING YOURSELF? OR DO

03:22:09.984 --> 03:22:12.453
YOU BELIEVE THAT THAT THIS

03:22:12.520 --> 03:22:14.522
ACTIVITY SHOULD BE REGULATED BY

03:22:14.589 --> 03:22:18.893
CCPA AND THAT THAT'S WHAT THE

03:22:18.960 --> 03:22:21.696
DISCUSSION IS ABOUT? CCPA

03:22:21.762 --> 03:22:23.998
PROTECTS IMMIGRATION AND

03:22:24.065 --> 03:22:25.299
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE, THAT

03:22:25.366 --> 03:22:26.767
THOSE BILLS HAVE ALREADY BEEN

03:22:26.834 --> 03:22:29.337
THERE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THE

03:22:29.403 --> 03:22:30.838
BUSINESSES THAT ARE ARE UNDER

03:22:30.905 --> 03:22:34.408
THE CCPA, THAT INFORMATION

03:22:34.475 --> 03:22:36.444
CANNOT BE ACCESSED FOR THOSE

03:22:36.511 --> 03:22:42.183
PURPOSES. AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT

03:22:42.250 --> 03:22:43.784
THAT'S WHERE WE SHOULD BE

03:22:43.851 --> 03:22:45.186
FOCUSING OUR, OUR TIME AND

03:22:45.253 --> 03:22:46.554
ENERGY. AND THAT REALLY DOESN'T

03:22:46.621 --> 03:22:48.055
APPLY. BUT THIS IS WHERE WE GOT

03:22:48.122 --> 03:22:49.824
INTO THE WHOLE DISCUSSION ABOUT

03:22:49.891 --> 03:22:54.161
CONSUMER PROTECTION. AND WE NEED

03:22:54.228 --> 03:22:56.664
I, WE NEED THE COMMITTEE ON

03:22:56.731 --> 03:22:57.965
CONSUMER PROTECTION, LOOKING AT

03:22:58.032 --> 03:22:59.600
THIS VERY CAREFULLY AND TRYING

03:22:59.667 --> 03:23:01.936
TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO YOU HOW DO

03:23:02.003 --> 03:23:05.606
YOU ALLOW FOR SOME PRIVATE RIGHT

03:23:05.673 --> 03:23:09.076
OF ACTION FOR REALLY EGREGIOUS

03:23:09.143 --> 03:23:11.445
BEHAVIOR, WHICH I BELIEVE YOU

03:23:11.512 --> 03:23:13.614
SHOULD HAVE TO PROVE CAUSES AN

03:23:13.681 --> 03:23:18.586
INJURY OR DAMAGE, OR SHOULD THE

03:23:18.653 --> 03:23:20.454
CONDUCT BE UNDER THE CCPA. AND

03:23:20.521 --> 03:23:23.724
SO IT WE'RE GOING TO GET IT

03:23:23.791 --> 03:23:25.693
RIGHT. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE SOME

03:23:25.760 --> 03:23:28.029
TIME TO MAKE SURE WE CAN SIT

03:23:28.095 --> 03:23:28.696
DOWN WITH, WITH ALL OF THE

03:23:28.763 --> 03:23:30.298
OPPOSITION AND MAKE MAKE SURE WE

03:23:30.364 --> 03:23:33.000
CAN WE CAN PARSE THE ISSUES THAT

03:23:33.067 --> 03:23:35.503
ARE DIFFERENT BASED ON THE

03:23:35.570 --> 03:23:36.304
DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE

03:23:36.370 --> 03:23:37.738
HERE. AND THAT'S THE COMMITMENT

03:23:37.805 --> 03:23:40.808
I'VE MADE TO THE CHAIR. AND I

03:23:40.875 --> 03:23:43.144
WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR

03:23:43.210 --> 03:23:45.980
VOTE TODAY. WELL, THANK YOU VERY

03:23:46.047 --> 03:23:48.916
MUCH, SENATOR. I WILL JUST NOTE

03:23:48.983 --> 03:23:50.551
BEFORE I GIVE MY RECOMMENDATION,

03:23:50.618 --> 03:23:52.019
THIS WILL BE OUR LAST ITEM OF

03:23:52.086 --> 03:23:53.854
THE DAY. SO AFTER THIS, WE WILL

03:23:53.921 --> 03:23:54.889
BE ADJOURNED RECESSING FOR LUNCH

03:23:54.956 --> 03:23:57.458
AND COMING BACK AT 130. NOT

03:23:57.525 --> 03:23:59.694
ADJOURNING RECESSING. THE SHORT

03:23:59.760 --> 03:24:01.295
ANSWER IS I WILL BE RECOMMENDING

03:24:01.362 --> 03:24:03.264
AN AYE FOR TODAY, AND I WOULD

03:24:03.331 --> 03:24:04.865
LIKE TO OFFER A LITTLE BIT OF

03:24:04.932 --> 03:24:06.167
CONTEXT. FIRST OF ALL, SENATOR,

03:24:06.233 --> 03:24:07.868
I AGREE WITH YOU ENTIRELY. NOT

03:24:07.935 --> 03:24:09.837
TO BELABOR THE POINT, BUT I

03:24:09.904 --> 03:24:10.838
THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

03:24:10.905 --> 03:24:12.707
ISSUE. IT'S WORTHY OF ROBUST

03:24:12.773 --> 03:24:14.475
CONVERSATION. THERE ARE MULTIPLE

03:24:14.542 --> 03:24:15.509
VIEWPOINTS. I DON'T THINK

03:24:15.576 --> 03:24:16.210
THREATENING SCORECARDS IS THE

03:24:16.277 --> 03:24:18.379
WAY TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION. I

03:24:18.446 --> 03:24:20.247
BELIEVE THAT BOTH THINGS CAN BE

03:24:20.314 --> 03:24:21.782
TRUE. I THINK THAT BUSINESSES

03:24:21.849 --> 03:24:23.050
AND AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT, I

03:24:23.117 --> 03:24:24.919
SHARE YOUR CONCERN ABOUT THE WAY

03:24:24.986 --> 03:24:26.621
THAT SMALL BUSINESSES AND

03:24:26.687 --> 03:24:27.855
NONPROFITS ARE REALLY BEING

03:24:27.922 --> 03:24:29.357
HAMMERED BY WHAT I SEE AS AN

03:24:29.423 --> 03:24:30.691
ABUSE OF PROCESS. AND I'VE SEEN

03:24:30.758 --> 03:24:33.127
THIS IN THE COURSE OF MY CAREER.

03:24:33.194 --> 03:24:33.995
I PROSECUTED A LOT OF MORTGAGE

03:24:34.061 --> 03:24:36.731
FRAUD AND SAW ABUSE OF OUR

03:24:36.797 --> 03:24:38.332
FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY PROCESSES.

03:24:38.399 --> 03:24:39.967
THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM FOR

03:24:40.034 --> 03:24:42.236
IMPROVEMENT. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT

03:24:42.303 --> 03:24:43.537
AMERICANS ARE UNDER GREATER

03:24:43.604 --> 03:24:45.006
SURVEILLANCE THAN EVER IN

03:24:45.072 --> 03:24:46.841
TODAY'S DAY AND AGE BY U.S.

03:24:46.907 --> 03:24:49.310
PRIVATE COMPANIES AND EVEN OUR

03:24:49.377 --> 03:24:50.845
GOVERNMENT. I THINK THAT WE HAVE

03:24:50.911 --> 03:24:52.279
TO BE EXTRAORDINARILY CAREFUL

03:24:52.346 --> 03:24:53.714
ABOUT HOW WE STRIKE THAT RIGHT

03:24:53.781 --> 03:24:55.016
BALANCE. AND I WANT TO ECHO

03:24:55.082 --> 03:24:56.217
SOMETHING THAT ASSEMBLYMEMBER

03:24:56.283 --> 03:24:58.152
GONZALEZ SAID. I KNOW YOU WELL

03:24:58.219 --> 03:24:59.086
ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT YOUR

03:24:59.153 --> 03:25:00.755
INTENTION IS TO FIND THAT RIGHT

03:25:00.821 --> 03:25:01.722
BALANCE. AND SO BEFORE I GO ON,

03:25:01.789 --> 03:25:05.192
I JUST WANT TO CONFIRM YOU WILL

03:25:05.259 --> 03:25:06.060
BE MAKING IT A TWO YEAR BILL AND

03:25:06.127 --> 03:25:06.894
CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION.

03:25:06.961 --> 03:25:08.796
CORRECT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH,

03:25:08.863 --> 03:25:10.131
SENATOR. I WISH I HAD ALL THE

03:25:10.197 --> 03:25:10.931
ANSWERS. I DON'T MYSELF, BUT I

03:25:10.998 --> 03:25:13.067
LOOK FORWARD TO BEING PART OF

03:25:13.134 --> 03:25:14.935
IT. AND WHAT I WOULD JUST SAY

03:25:15.002 --> 03:25:16.037
FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION FOR THE

03:25:16.103 --> 03:25:17.805
NEXT COMMITTEE. I THINK, YOU

03:25:17.872 --> 03:25:19.273
KNOW, JUST SPEAKING FROM MY

03:25:19.340 --> 03:25:19.974
PERSPECTIVE, THE GREATEST

03:25:20.041 --> 03:25:20.941
CONCERN THAT I HAVE, I'M NOT

03:25:21.008 --> 03:25:23.277
GOING TO NAME NAMES, BUT I WILL

03:25:23.344 --> 03:25:25.079
NOTE THAT PAGE 14 OF OUR

03:25:25.146 --> 03:25:26.647
EXCELLENT COMMITTEE ANALYSIS, I

03:25:26.714 --> 03:25:28.582
MIGHT ADD, REFERS TO A CASE,

03:25:28.649 --> 03:25:31.519
CGRTS VERSUS ORACLE. THE

03:25:31.585 --> 03:25:34.655
CITATION IS 668 FED SUP 3928.

03:25:34.722 --> 03:25:37.958
THERE ARE REAL CONCERNS ABOUT

03:25:38.025 --> 03:25:39.293
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

03:25:39.360 --> 03:25:40.661
LEGITIMATE BUSINESS OPERATIONS

03:25:40.728 --> 03:25:41.862
AND PURPOSES WHERE WE COLLECT

03:25:41.929 --> 03:25:43.764
THIS DATA. BUT THE REALITY IS,

03:25:43.831 --> 03:25:45.433
IS THAT DATA IS CAPTURED AND

03:25:45.499 --> 03:25:47.301
PACKAGED AND WE ARE BEING

03:25:47.368 --> 03:25:48.669
SURVEILLED, SURVEILLED WHEREVER

03:25:48.736 --> 03:25:49.904
WE MOVE ACROSS THE INTERNET. AND

03:25:49.970 --> 03:25:51.272
THAT SHOULD BE CONCERNING TO

03:25:51.338 --> 03:25:53.040
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US. AND TO

03:25:53.107 --> 03:25:54.842
FIND THE RIGHT BALANCE IS THE

03:25:54.909 --> 03:25:56.744
GOAL OF THIS PROCESS. SO I WILL

03:25:56.811 --> 03:25:58.779
SUM UP IN SAYING THAT FOR TODAY,

03:25:58.846 --> 03:26:00.414
I AM RECOMMENDING AN I. I TRUST

03:26:00.481 --> 03:26:01.816
MY COLLEAGUE. I BELIEVE SHE

03:26:01.882 --> 03:26:03.984
WANTS TO GET IT RIGHT. I WANT

03:26:04.051 --> 03:26:06.053
THE PROCESS TO HAVE A CHANCE TO

03:26:06.120 --> 03:26:06.887
PLAY OUT. HOPEFULLY WE CAN FIND

03:26:06.954 --> 03:26:08.789
A GOOD ANSWER AND WE'LL HAVE AN

03:26:08.856 --> 03:26:09.690
OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE AGAIN ON IT

03:26:09.757 --> 03:26:12.059
NEXT YEAR. TO THOSE WHO HAVE

03:26:12.126 --> 03:26:13.694
CONCERNS THAT DON'T LIKE MY

03:26:13.761 --> 03:26:15.763
POSITION OR HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF

03:26:15.830 --> 03:26:17.531
APPROACH, PLEASE ENGAGE. LET'S

03:26:17.598 --> 03:26:18.966
NOT TALK AT EACH OTHER. LET'S

03:26:19.033 --> 03:26:20.201
TALK WITH EACH OTHER. AND WE

03:26:20.267 --> 03:26:22.236
HAVE A VERY CAPABLE AND WILLING

03:26:22.303 --> 03:26:23.671
AUTHOR WILLING TO HAVE THAT

03:26:23.738 --> 03:26:25.139
CONVERSATION. SO LET'S NOT TALK

03:26:25.206 --> 03:26:26.741
AT EACH OTHER. WITH THAT. WE

03:26:26.807 --> 03:26:27.742
HAVE A MOTION. AND A SECOND.

03:26:27.808 --> 03:26:30.478
LET'S CALL THE ROLL FOR ITEM

PREVENTATIVE MEASURES THAT WILL

05:08:42.170 --> 05:08:44.539
ACT AS A REAL DETERRENT FROM

05:08:44.606 --> 05:08:46.074

ASK YOU TO DO IS SHARE YOUR

05:09:08.963 --> 05:09:10.265

WHAT HE WENT THROUGH. SO I'LL

05:09:19.207 --> 05:09:20.842
HAND IT OFF TO LOU TO SHARE HIS

05:09:20.909 --> 05:09:24.078

JOURNEYMAN LINEMAN INSPECTOR,

05:09:27.148 --> 05:09:29.083
I'VE BEEN IN THE UNION. THIS

05:09:29.150 --> 05:09:32.086
WILL BE MY 30TH YEAR, AND I'VE

05:09:32.153 --> 05:09:34.055
EXPERIENCED A LOT OF DARKNESS,

05:09:34.122 --> 05:09:36.557
BUT NOT THAT KIND OF DARKNESS.

05:09:36.624 --> 05:09:38.126
I'M USED TO THE LIGHTS BEING OUT

05:09:38.192 --> 05:09:41.062
AND RESTORING POWER. BUT ON THAT

05:09:41.129 --> 05:09:44.165
DAY WHEN I WAS ACCOSTED BY THREE

05:09:44.232 --> 05:09:46.200
INDIVIDUALS, I CHANGED MY WHOLE

05:09:46.267 --> 05:09:48.670
DEMEANOR. MY WHOLE VALUE OF LIFE

05:09:48.736 --> 05:09:50.405
FLASHED BEFORE MY EYES, AND I

05:09:50.471 --> 05:09:51.773
JUST ALL I COULD DO WAS THINK

05:09:51.839 --> 05:09:54.375
ABOUT MY FAMILY AND HOW THEY

05:09:54.442 --> 05:09:56.844
DEPEND ON ME. AND I WAS OUT

05:09:56.911 --> 05:10:00.548
THERE IN NO MAN'S LAND AND LEFT,

05:10:00.615 --> 05:10:02.050
HOLDING THE BALL WITH NOWHERE TO

05:10:02.116 --> 05:10:04.919
GO. SO BY, YOU KNOW, BY THE

05:10:04.986 --> 05:10:07.555
GRACE OF GOD, I WAS ABLE TO MOVE

05:10:07.622 --> 05:10:09.490
OUT OF THE LINE OF FIRE IN, IN,

05:10:09.557 --> 05:10:16.831
IN A TACTICAL WAY. AND. IT IT

05:10:16.898 --> 05:10:18.166
HAPPENED. LET ME. WELL, I'LL

05:10:18.232 --> 05:10:20.168
JUST SHARE IT LIKE THIS. I'M

05:10:20.234 --> 05:10:22.503
SHOOK UP JUST TALKING ABOUT IT.

05:10:22.570 --> 05:10:24.639
YOU KNOW, I CONSIDER MYSELF AN

05:10:24.706 --> 05:10:26.941
EXPERIENCED EMPLOYEE. I DID NOT

05:10:27.008 --> 05:10:29.444
REALIZE THAT I TOO, AM A NON

05:10:29.510 --> 05:10:31.713
EXEMPT FROM THE PERILS OF WHAT'S

05:10:31.779 --> 05:10:33.047
OUT THERE ON THE STREET AT ANY

05:10:33.114 --> 05:10:35.917
GIVEN TIME, THE IMPACT OF BEING

05:10:35.984 --> 05:10:37.618
ACCOSTED BY THAT TRIO OF

05:10:37.685 --> 05:10:40.254
INDIVIDUALS WHILE DOING MY JOB

05:10:40.321 --> 05:10:41.689
WAS WAS THE FURTHEST THING FROM

05:10:41.756 --> 05:10:44.158
MY MIND. THE LASTING EFFECTS OF

05:10:44.225 --> 05:10:46.394
THE ANGUISH THAT WAS CAUSED BY

05:10:46.461 --> 05:10:49.464
THAT INCIDENT STILL HAVE A

05:10:49.530 --> 05:10:59.140
PLACE. AND. AT THAT TIME WAS

05:10:59.207 --> 05:11:03.811
MENTALLY OVERWHELMING FOR ME.

05:11:03.878 --> 05:11:06.614
TOTAL WILL. TOTAL WORKER

05:11:06.681 --> 05:11:09.717
WELL-BEING IS NOT A TREND. THE

05:11:09.784 --> 05:11:11.319
VERY ASPECT OF LIFE ON LIFE'S

05:11:11.386 --> 05:11:12.987
TERMS FOR ME CHANGED

05:11:13.054 --> 05:11:14.355
DRAMATICALLY THAT DAY. I HAD TO

05:11:14.422 --> 05:11:16.391
DO SOME SELF CENTERING, GETTING

05:11:16.457 --> 05:11:21.295
BACK INTO SOME THERAPY SESSIONS

05:11:21.362 --> 05:11:26.200
TO GET MYSELF BACK ON TRACK AND.

05:11:26.267 --> 05:11:30.938
I THINK THE SUPPORT THAT CAME

05:11:31.005 --> 05:11:33.107
FOLLOWING THAT WAS HELPFUL. BUT

05:11:33.174 --> 05:11:35.910
YOU KNOW, TURNING IT OVER IS

05:11:35.977 --> 05:11:38.112
BEEN A STRUGGLE FOR ME AND I'M

05:11:38.179 --> 05:11:39.714
STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW. I'M SORRY,

05:11:39.781 --> 05:11:43.317
BUT LET ME FINISH MY WHAT I CAN

05:11:43.384 --> 05:11:49.724
SAY. LEADERS THAT RECOGNIZE

05:11:49.791 --> 05:11:50.691
SAFETY AND WELLNESS WERE VERY

05:11:50.758 --> 05:11:53.928
HELPFUL TO ME, AND THEY

05:12:44.312 --> 05:12:46.247

PUBLIC AND REALLY TALK ABOUT OUR

05:12:59.527 --> 05:13:00.194
EXPERIENCES. BUT I THINK THAT

05:13:00.261 --> 05:13:02.096
THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO MAKE

05:13:02.163 --> 05:13:03.931
PUBLIC POLICY IS TO BRING TO THE

CALIFORNIA ACTION. OUR

ORGANIZATION IS IN RESPECTFUL

05:15:00.548 --> 05:15:02.483
OPPOSITION TO SB 431, UNLESS

05:15:02.550 --> 05:15:04.118
AMENDED. WE WANT TO THANK THE

05:15:04.185 --> 05:15:06.220
AUTHOR FOR AGREEING TO NARROW

05:15:06.287 --> 05:15:07.955
THE DEFINITION IN THIS BILL WITH

05:15:08.022 --> 05:15:09.757
PENDING COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS.

05:15:09.824 --> 05:15:11.192
HOWEVER, WE'RE HOPING FURTHER

05:15:11.259 --> 05:15:11.759
AMENDMENTS THAT THE SENATOR

05:15:11.826 --> 05:15:14.095
WOULD CONSIDER FURTHER STRIKING

05:15:14.161 --> 05:15:15.096
UTILITY WORKER, THE NEWLY

05:15:15.162 --> 05:15:16.697
DEFINED UTILITY WORKER IN PENAL

05:15:16.764 --> 05:15:19.500
CODE SECTION 241, SUBDIVISION C,

05:15:19.567 --> 05:15:21.636
AND MOVE IT TO SECTION 241,

05:15:21.702 --> 05:15:23.204
SUBDIVISION A. THIS WOULD STILL

05:15:23.271 --> 05:15:25.106
ALLOW FOR AN ENHANCED PENALTY.

05:15:25.172 --> 05:15:26.941
IN ADDITION, WE ARE ASKING THE

05:15:27.008 --> 05:15:28.409
AUTHOR TO STRIKE REFERENCE TO

05:15:28.476 --> 05:15:30.645
UTILITY WORKER IN SECTION 243,

05:15:30.711 --> 05:15:32.580
SUBDIVISION B ALTOGETHER, AS WE

05:15:32.647 --> 05:15:34.548
DO NOT FIND THIS PROVISION

05:15:34.615 --> 05:15:36.784
NECESSARY, IT IS INCREDIBLY

05:15:36.851 --> 05:15:38.152
IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT

05:15:38.219 --> 05:15:39.987
EXISTING LAW COVERS THE

05:15:40.054 --> 05:15:41.555
SITUATIONS THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO

05:15:41.622 --> 05:15:43.190
ADDRESS. EXISTING CRIMINAL

05:15:43.257 --> 05:15:44.292
PENALTIES FOR THIS TYPE OF

05:15:44.358 --> 05:15:45.993
CONDUCT RANGE FROM MISDEMEANOR

05:15:46.060 --> 05:15:47.828
TO FELONY CONVICTIONS. THERE IS

05:15:47.895 --> 05:15:49.697
NO EVIDENCE TO INDICATE THAT OUR

05:15:49.764 --> 05:15:51.065
CURRENT LAWS AND SENTENCING

05:15:51.132 --> 05:15:52.867
STRUCTURE FAIL TO OFFER AS MUCH

05:15:52.933 --> 05:15:54.568
DETERRENCE AS THIS BILL ATTEMPTS

05:15:54.635 --> 05:15:56.971
TO PROVIDE. WE HAVE LOOKED FOR

05:15:57.038 --> 05:15:58.639
AND BEEN UNABLE TO LOCATE, ANY

05:15:58.706 --> 05:15:59.740
EVIDENCE THAT AN ADDITIONAL SIX

05:15:59.807 --> 05:16:01.008
MONTHS OF INCARCERATION WOULD

05:16:01.075 --> 05:16:02.343
EITHER ENHANCE COMMUNITY SAFETY

05:16:02.410 --> 05:16:03.911
OR SERVE AS A DETERRENT TO THESE

05:16:03.978 --> 05:16:06.314
TYPES OF SITUATIONS. TO THE

05:16:06.380 --> 05:16:07.782
CONTRARY, THERE ARE LARGE BODIES

05:16:07.848 --> 05:16:09.216
OF RESEARCH THAT SHOW CRIMINAL,

05:16:09.283 --> 05:16:11.018
LONGER CRIMINAL SENTENCES

05:16:11.085 --> 05:16:12.386
ULTIMATELY DO NOT MAKE OUR

05:16:12.453 --> 05:16:14.388
COMMUNITIES ANY SAFER. INSTEAD,

05:16:14.455 --> 05:16:15.790
THEY DRAIN TAXPAYER DOLLARS

05:16:15.856 --> 05:16:17.158
WHILE SEPARATING PEOPLE FROM

05:16:17.224 --> 05:16:18.559
SUPPORT SYSTEM AND INFLICTING

05:16:18.626 --> 05:16:20.394
FINANCIAL BURDENS ONTO THESE

05:16:20.461 --> 05:16:21.429
INDIVIDUALS. CAUGHT UP IN THIS

05:16:21.495 --> 05:16:23.197
COSTLY MASS INCARCERATION

05:16:23.264 --> 05:16:24.865
MACHINE. I UNDERSTAND THE AUTHOR

05:16:24.932 --> 05:16:26.133
IS TRYING TO CREATE PARITY WITH

05:16:26.200 --> 05:16:27.968
THESE PENALTIES, AMONG OTHER

05:16:28.035 --> 05:16:28.903
PROFESSIONS SUCH AS LAW

05:16:28.969 --> 05:16:31.138
ENFORCEMENT OR NURSES. HOWEVER,

05:16:31.205 --> 05:16:32.940
PARITY THAT CONTRIBUTES TO AN

05:16:33.007 --> 05:16:34.475
INEQUITABLE JUSTICE SYSTEM DOES

05:16:34.542 --> 05:16:36.277
NOT MAKE FOR GOOD POLICY. FOR

05:16:36.344 --> 05:16:37.378
THESE REASONS, WE ARE IN

05:16:37.445 --> 05:16:40.081
RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO SB 431

05:16:40.147 --> 05:16:41.315
UNLESS UNLESS IT IS FURTHER

05:16:41.382 --> 05:16:43.718
AMENDED. THANK YOU. HI, MY NAME

05:16:43.784 --> 05:16:45.720

DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER.

05:16:48.923 --> 05:16:50.024
I'M A MEMBER IN GOOD STANDING

05:16:50.091 --> 05:16:50.825
WITH THE INTERNATIONAL

05:16:50.891 --> 05:16:51.559
BROTHERHOOD OF ELECTRICAL

05:16:51.625 --> 05:16:53.794
WORKERS LOCAL 18. MY COMMENTS

05:16:53.861 --> 05:16:55.496
ARE MY OWN AND DO NOT REPRESENT

05:16:55.563 --> 05:16:57.064
MY LOCAL, MY EMPLOYER, AND I

05:16:57.131 --> 05:16:58.999
WANT TO SAY OR ANYBODY ELSE. BUT

05:16:59.066 --> 05:17:00.968
A LOT OF MY BROTHERS THAT I

05:17:01.035 --> 05:17:02.436
SPOKE WITH ACTUALLY AGREE WITH

05:17:02.503 --> 05:17:04.238
MY VIEWPOINT. I APPRECIATE THE

05:17:04.305 --> 05:17:04.972
AUTHOR'S CONCERN FOR PUBLIC

05:17:05.039 --> 05:17:05.773
UTILITY WORKERS. I DO NOT WISH

05:17:05.840 --> 05:17:07.942
ANY HARM ON MY BROTHERS, NOR DO

05:17:08.008 --> 05:17:09.677
I WISH ANY HARM TO ANYBODY. MY

05:17:09.744 --> 05:17:11.512
UNION I AND MY UNION BROTHERS

05:17:11.579 --> 05:17:13.581
WHO JUST SPOKE. WE ARE NOT

05:17:13.647 --> 05:17:15.082
EXCEPTIONAL PEOPLE. EVERY PERSON

05:17:15.149 --> 05:17:16.717
WHO COMMITS AN ASSAULT SHOULD BE

05:17:16.784 --> 05:17:17.585
TREATED WITH HARSH

05:17:17.651 --> 05:17:18.686
REPERCUSSIONS, NO MATTER WHO THE

05:17:18.753 --> 05:17:20.821
VICTIM IS. WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO

05:17:20.888 --> 05:17:22.223
MY BROTHER OVER HERE AND

05:17:22.289 --> 05:17:23.357
EVERYTHING THAT MY BROTHER HERE

05:17:23.424 --> 05:17:24.992
TALKED ABOUT IS INEXCUSABLE. IT

05:17:25.059 --> 05:17:26.694
SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED, BUT

05:17:26.761 --> 05:17:28.662
I FEEL THE DOUBLING OF FINES AND

05:17:28.729 --> 05:17:31.098
JAIL TIME IS NOT GOING TO BE THE

05:17:31.165 --> 05:17:31.799
ANSWER. THIS WILL NOT STOP A

05:17:31.866 --> 05:17:33.067
POTENTIAL PREDATOR FROM

05:17:33.134 --> 05:17:34.268
COMMITTING AN ASSAULT. AND MY

05:17:34.335 --> 05:17:35.736
QUESTION IS, HAS IT ACTUALLY

05:17:35.803 --> 05:17:36.203
STOPPED FOR THE OTHER

05:17:36.270 --> 05:17:37.972
EXCEPTIONAL CLASS OF PEOPLE THAT

05:17:38.038 --> 05:17:39.573
ARE COVERED IN PENAL CODE 241

05:17:39.640 --> 05:17:41.642
AND 243? I FEEL IT'S THE

05:17:41.709 --> 05:17:42.810
ATTITUDE OF THE LEGISLATORS,

05:17:42.877 --> 05:17:44.879
JUDGES AND OTHER LOCAL ELECTED

05:17:44.945 --> 05:17:46.046
OFFICIALS THAT HAVE BEEN SOFT ON

05:17:46.113 --> 05:17:47.181
CRIME, REDUCING FUNDING FOR

05:17:47.248 --> 05:17:48.582
BUILDING NEW JAILS, CLOSING

05:17:48.649 --> 05:17:50.017
PRISONS, NO BAIL POLICY, CATCH

05:17:50.084 --> 05:17:51.752
AND RELEASE. AND LET'S GIVE

05:17:51.819 --> 05:17:53.587
DIVERSION A CHANCE AS A SOLUTION

05:17:53.654 --> 05:17:55.389
IS NO SOLUTION AT ALL. THIS HAS

05:17:55.456 --> 05:17:56.824
CREATED AN ATMOSPHERE WHERE

05:17:56.891 --> 05:17:58.793
PEOPLE KNOW THERE'S REALLY NO

05:17:58.859 --> 05:18:00.027
REPERCUSSIONS FOR THEIR ACTIONS

05:18:00.094 --> 05:18:01.495
AFTER THIS LAW IS PASSED IN

05:18:01.562 --> 05:18:02.897
CHAPTER IN A CODE, I DON'T THINK

05:18:02.963 --> 05:18:05.065
THIS IS GOING TO STOP ANY WOULD

05:18:05.132 --> 05:18:06.200
BE ASSAILANTS THAT'S GOING TO DO

05:18:06.267 --> 05:18:08.169
THIS UNDER THE GUISE OF CRIMES

05:18:08.235 --> 05:18:10.538
OF PASSION, IF YOU WILL, BECAUSE

05:18:10.604 --> 05:18:11.539
THEY MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN AWAY WITH

05:18:11.605 --> 05:18:13.040
THIS SO MUCH ALREADY THAT IT

05:18:13.107 --> 05:18:14.241
DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE

05:18:14.308 --> 05:18:15.476
PENALTIES ARE BECOMING, BECAUSE

05:18:15.543 --> 05:18:17.778
THAT SIX MONTHS TURNING IN A

05:18:17.845 --> 05:18:18.546
YEAR, IF THEY EVEN GET THAT

05:18:18.612 --> 05:18:19.880
SENTENCE, IS GOING TO BE

05:18:19.947 --> 05:18:21.081
RELEASED EARLY BECAUSE OF EITHER

05:18:21.148 --> 05:18:22.082
SHORT STAFFING OR OVERCROWDING,

05:18:22.149 --> 05:18:23.050
CAUSING ONLY A FRACTION OF THE

05:18:23.117 --> 05:18:24.985
SENTENCE TO BE SERVED AT THE

05:18:25.052 --> 05:18:28.522
LOCAL JAIL. SO I FEEL THIS BILL

05:18:28.589 --> 05:18:29.723
IS NO DETERRENT. BUT WHAT COULD

05:18:29.790 --> 05:18:32.126
BE SOLUTIONS ALLOWING US AS

05:18:32.193 --> 05:18:32.793
WORKERS TO DEFEND OURSELVES

05:18:32.860 --> 05:18:34.295
WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT HAVING

05:18:34.361 --> 05:18:35.696
ANY CRIMINAL LIABILITY FOR IT,

05:18:35.763 --> 05:18:37.431
OR ANY CIVIL LIABILITY WITHOUT

05:18:37.498 --> 05:18:39.066
HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT LOSING OUR

05:18:39.133 --> 05:18:40.601
JOBS, FOR DEFENDING OURSELVES

05:18:40.668 --> 05:18:42.503
AND NOT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT

05:18:42.570 --> 05:18:44.205
OUR EMPLOYERS HAVING TO DEAL

05:18:44.271 --> 05:18:46.707
WITH CIVIL LIABILITY FOR US,

05:18:46.774 --> 05:18:47.341
DEFENDING OURSELVES WHEN WE ARE

05:18:47.408 --> 05:18:50.945
BEING ATTACKED. AT THAT POINT IN

05:18:51.011 --> 05:18:52.346
TIME, I REALLY FEEL THAT THE

05:18:52.413 --> 05:18:53.447
STATE, AS YOU'RE DOING

05:18:53.514 --> 05:18:54.815
LEGISLATORS, CAN IMPLEMENT YOUR

05:18:54.882 --> 05:18:55.916
RESTORATIVE JUSTICE MEASURES

05:18:55.983 --> 05:18:57.651
THAT YOU ARE NOW DOING. WITH

05:18:57.718 --> 05:18:58.686
THAT SAID, I KNOW YOU'RE ALL

05:18:58.752 --> 05:19:01.121
GOING TO VOTE FOR THIS, AND I

05:19:01.188 --> 05:19:03.657
ASK YOU TO CONSIDER MY, MY, MY

05:19:03.724 --> 05:19:05.059
SOLUTIONS IN THE FUTURE SO THAT

05:19:05.125 --> 05:19:06.360
WE AS WORKERS CAN DEFEND

05:19:06.427 --> 05:19:08.229
OURSELVES WHILE OUT ON THE FIELD

05:19:08.295 --> 05:19:09.430
WHILE IT HAPPENS, AS OPPOSED TO

05:19:09.497 --> 05:19:11.832
THE COURTS REACTING TO IT AFTER

05:19:11.899 --> 05:19:14.435
THE FACT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU

05:19:14.502 --> 05:19:16.070
BOTH VERY MUCH FOR YOUR

05:19:16.136 --> 05:19:17.037
COMMENTS. IF YOU'D LIKE, YOU'RE

05:19:17.104 --> 05:19:18.205
WELCOME TO REMAIN SEATED, AS THE

05:19:18.272 --> 05:19:20.074
PANEL MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE

05:19:20.140 --> 05:19:21.809
QUESTIONS FOR ANY OF YOU. WE'LL

05:19:21.876 --> 05:19:23.611
GO WITH ANY OTHER METOOS ANYONE

05:19:23.677 --> 05:19:25.346
ELSE HOPING TO BE HEARD IN

05:19:25.412 --> 05:19:26.413
OPPOSITION TO THE BILL? OKAY.

05:19:26.480 --> 05:19:27.848
SEEING NO RESPONSE, I'LL TURN IT

05:19:27.915 --> 05:19:30.684
BACK TO THE DAIS. ARE THERE ANY

05:19:30.751 --> 05:19:33.787
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS? ALL

05:19:33.854 --> 05:19:37.124
RIGHT, I GUESS, MR. CHAIR, I

05:19:37.191 --> 05:19:38.959
JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR YOU.

05:19:39.026 --> 05:19:40.828
YOU HEARD SOME CONCERNS,

05:19:40.895 --> 05:19:41.929
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES, BUT

05:19:41.996 --> 05:19:43.030
CONCERNS NONETHELESS RAISED BY

05:19:43.097 --> 05:19:44.832
THE OPPOSITION. ANYTHING THAT

05:19:44.899 --> 05:19:47.067
YOU WANTED TO ADD IN RESPONSE TO

05:19:47.134 --> 05:19:48.435
SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS THAT WERE

05:19:48.502 --> 05:19:51.038
ADDRESSED? SURE. HAPPY TO

05:19:51.105 --> 05:19:52.740
CONTINUE TO ENGAGE WITH THE ACLU

05:19:52.806 --> 05:19:55.476
ON THIS BILL. BUT, YOU KNOW,

05:19:55.543 --> 05:19:59.813
THIS IS MIRRORED ON OTHER

05:19:59.880 --> 05:20:01.715
PROVISIONS OF THE PENAL CODE

05:20:01.782 --> 05:20:03.117
THAT PROVIDE PROTECTIONS FOR

05:20:03.183 --> 05:20:04.652
OTHER ESSENTIAL WORKERS,

05:20:04.718 --> 05:20:08.055
INCLUDING EMTS, FIREFIGHTERS,

05:20:08.122 --> 05:20:11.559
PEACE OFFICERS. AND I UNDERSTAND

05:20:11.625 --> 05:20:13.661
THAT THE SUBSTANTIVE IMPACT OF

05:20:13.727 --> 05:20:14.628
THE CHANGES REQUESTED ARE

05:20:14.695 --> 05:20:16.730
REDUCED, THE AMOUNT OF THE

05:20:16.797 --> 05:20:18.132
PENALTIES. BUT WE FRANKLY THINK

05:20:18.198 --> 05:20:19.967
THOSE PENALTIES ARE AN IMPORTANT

05:20:20.034 --> 05:20:22.202
DISINCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE

05:20:22.269 --> 05:20:24.238
COMMITTING ASSAULT AGAINST THESE

05:20:24.305 --> 05:20:25.706
ESSENTIAL WORKERS. AND JUST TO

05:20:25.773 --> 05:20:28.709
KIND OF PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE,

05:20:28.776 --> 05:20:30.678
THERE HAVE BEEN 140 REPORTED

05:20:30.744 --> 05:20:34.815
INCIDENTS SINCE 2024 OF THREATS

05:20:34.882 --> 05:20:37.351
AND ASSAULT AGAINST UTILITY

05:20:37.418 --> 05:20:39.253
WORKERS, INCLUDING SHOOTINGS,

05:20:39.320 --> 05:20:42.022
STABBINGS, HARASSMENT. AND SO

05:20:42.089 --> 05:20:43.457
CURRENT LAW DOES NOT PROVIDE

05:20:43.524 --> 05:20:45.159
ADEQUATE DETERRENCE AGAINST

05:20:45.225 --> 05:20:46.827
THESE TYPES OF THREATS THAT

05:20:46.894 --> 05:20:48.963
THESE WORKERS FACE. AND SO THIS

05:20:49.029 --> 05:20:50.397
REALLY THIS BILL IS ABOUT

05:20:50.464 --> 05:20:51.398
EMPHASIZING ACCOUNTABILITY AND

05:20:51.465 --> 05:20:53.233
MAKING A STRONG MESSAGE THAT

05:20:53.300 --> 05:20:55.102
VIOLENCE AGAINST THESE ESSENTIAL

05:20:55.169 --> 05:20:56.103
WORKERS SHOULD NOT BE TOLERATED

05:20:56.170 --> 05:21:01.976
IN CALIFORNIA. AND JUST IN

05:21:02.042 --> 05:21:04.478
ADDITION, JUST TO CITE A FEW OF

05:21:04.545 --> 05:21:05.946
THE SPECIFIC INSTANCES, JANUARY

05:21:06.013 --> 05:21:07.247
2024 EMPLOYEES OF LOS ANGELES

05:21:07.314 --> 05:21:08.582
WATER AND POWER ALERTED POLICE

05:21:08.649 --> 05:21:10.150
OF THREATS INVOLVING BODILY

05:21:10.217 --> 05:21:12.653
HARM. DECEMBER 2024 ON DUTY

05:21:12.720 --> 05:21:14.021
SOCAL EDISON EMPLOYEES WERE

05:21:14.088 --> 05:21:16.991
DIRECT TARGETS OF GUNFIRE. 2022

05:21:17.057 --> 05:21:18.659
PGA EMPLOYEE WAS STABBED WHILE

05:21:18.726 --> 05:21:20.961
MARKING GAS LINES IN SAN

05:21:21.028 --> 05:21:22.296
FRANCISCO, SO THERE HAVE BEEN

05:21:22.363 --> 05:21:23.697
NUMEROUS INCIDENTS. ESCALATION

05:21:23.764 --> 05:21:25.899
OF INSTANCE, PARTICULARLY AROUND

05:21:25.966 --> 05:21:27.067
POWER SAFETY, SHUT OFFS AND

05:21:27.134 --> 05:21:29.269
OTHER CRITICAL INCIDENTS. AND

05:21:29.336 --> 05:21:30.804
THIS REALLY IS ABOUT AFFIRMING

05:21:30.871 --> 05:21:32.706
THE SAME LEVEL OF PROTECTION TO

05:21:32.773 --> 05:21:34.141
THESE ESSENTIAL WORKERS THAT

05:21:34.208 --> 05:21:36.043
OTHER PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL

05:21:36.110 --> 05:21:41.048
HAVE. WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH,

05:21:41.115 --> 05:21:43.050
MR. CHAIR, BEFORE I ALLOW YOU A

05:21:43.117 --> 05:21:44.084

05:21:44.151 --> 05:21:46.220
QUESTION. RAISE ANY COMMENTS OR

05:21:46.286 --> 05:21:48.088
QUESTIONS FROM OTHER MEMBERS OF

05:21:48.155 --> 05:21:50.658

05:21:52.793 --> 05:21:53.360
COMMENT. OKAY. DOCTOR COLLINS,

05:21:57.865 --> 05:21:59.667
DECORUM THAT'S REQUIRED WHEN WE

05:21:59.733 --> 05:22:02.569

WHEN IT COMES TO VOTING. NO

05:22:09.043 --> 05:22:10.778
PROPS WITHOUT APPROVALS. SO FROM

05:22:14.448 --> 05:22:16.316
PAST, LET'S JUST MAKE SURE THAT

05:22:16.383 --> 05:22:17.718

AS WE MOVE FORWARD, I'M JUST

05:22:24.258 --> 05:22:26.226
POINTING THAT OUT. DO NOT ASK

05:22:26.293 --> 05:22:27.394
QUESTIONS. JUST KNOW JUST POINT

05:22:37.071 --> 05:22:38.906
I RESPECTFULLY ASK, I VOTE I

05:22:38.972 --> 05:22:41.375
THINK THE TESTIMONY OFFERED BY

05:22:41.442 --> 05:22:43.143
THIS GENTLEMAN, I THINK, CLEARLY

05:22:43.210 --> 05:22:44.578
ILLUSTRATES THAT THIS IS A REAL

05:22:44.645 --> 05:22:46.747
ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA THAT

05:22:46.814 --> 05:22:48.916
THREATENS THE SAFETY OF UTILITY

05:22:48.982 --> 05:22:50.718
WORKERS ON A DAILY BASIS. I

05:22:50.784 --> 05:22:52.519
THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR NARROWLY

05:22:52.586 --> 05:22:54.888
FOCUSING THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL

05:22:54.955 --> 05:22:56.290
AND ONCE AGAIN, RESPECTFULLY ASK

05:22:56.356 --> 05:22:58.225
FOR AN AYE VOTE. WELL, THANK YOU

05:22:58.292 --> 05:22:59.460
VERY MUCH, MR. CHAIR. I'LL BE

05:22:59.526 --> 05:23:01.095
BRIEF, COLLEAGUES, I AM

05:23:01.161 --> 05:23:02.896
RECOMMENDING AN AYE. I DO WANT

05:23:02.963 --> 05:23:03.897
TO THANK. I'LL START WITH I WANT

05:23:03.964 --> 05:23:05.833
TO THANK THE OPPOSITION

05:23:05.899 --> 05:23:07.201
WITNESSES. I THOUGHT THAT YOU

05:23:07.267 --> 05:23:08.302
BOTH RAISED VERY GOOD POINTS TO

05:23:08.368 --> 05:23:09.470
OUR REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE

05:23:09.536 --> 05:23:10.938
ACLU. I DON'T DISAGREE THAT

05:23:11.004 --> 05:23:12.272
THERE ARE DISCREPANCIES AND

05:23:12.339 --> 05:23:13.440
DISPARITIES IN OUR CRIMINAL

05:23:13.507 --> 05:23:15.209
LAWS, AND THOSE ABSOLUTELY

05:23:15.275 --> 05:23:17.711
SHOULD BE REMEDIED. BUT WE ALSO

05:23:17.778 --> 05:23:19.880
THE WAY I COME AT THIS IS I DO

05:23:19.947 --> 05:23:21.682
WANT SIMILARLY SITUATED PEOPLE

05:23:21.749 --> 05:23:23.117
TO BE TREATED AT LEAST AS

05:23:23.183 --> 05:23:24.985
SIMILAR AS POSSIBLE AS WE CAN

05:23:25.052 --> 05:23:27.788
ACHIEVE UNDER OUR LEGAL SYSTEM.

05:23:27.855 --> 05:23:28.856
TO OUR OTHER WITNESS, I

05:23:28.922 --> 05:23:30.090
APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS, AND

05:23:30.157 --> 05:23:32.126
WHAT I WOULD SAY IN RESPONSE IS

05:23:32.192 --> 05:23:33.060
THAT NOBODY SHOULD SHOW HAVE TO

05:23:33.127 --> 05:23:34.728
SHOW UP TO WORK WONDERING

05:23:34.795 --> 05:23:36.830
WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO WHETHER

05:23:36.897 --> 05:23:37.464
THEY'RE GOING TO BE ASSAULTED

05:23:37.531 --> 05:23:38.298
TODAY, WHETHER YOU'RE A TRANSIT

05:23:38.365 --> 05:23:39.933
OPERATOR, A POLICE OFFICER, OR

05:23:40.000 --> 05:23:41.502
SOMEONE WHO'S SHUTTING OFF POWER

05:23:41.568 --> 05:23:42.970
IN COMPLIANCE WITH LADWP OR ANY

05:23:43.036 --> 05:23:45.506
OTHER UTILITY, I GET THAT

05:23:45.572 --> 05:23:47.574
TENSIONS AND EMOTIONS CAN RUN

05:23:47.641 --> 05:23:49.343
HIGH. BUT THROWING ITEMS AT

05:23:49.409 --> 05:23:50.811
PEOPLE TRYING TO PHYSICALLY HARM

05:23:50.878 --> 05:23:51.979
ANOTHER PERSON FOR JUST DOING

05:23:52.045 --> 05:23:53.347
THEIR JOB AS WHAT HAPPENED TO

05:23:53.413 --> 05:23:55.482
YOU, SIR? THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE. I

05:23:55.549 --> 05:23:57.050
WISH I COULD SAY THAT ANY BILL

05:23:57.117 --> 05:23:58.752
WE COULD PASS IN THIS BUILDING

05:23:58.819 --> 05:24:01.288
WOULD CHANGE WHAT I SEE AS A

05:24:01.355 --> 05:24:02.523
MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS, AND REALLY

05:24:02.589 --> 05:24:03.791
AN ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT THAT WE

05:24:03.857 --> 05:24:05.192
ALL NEED TO MAKE COLLECTIVELY AS

05:24:05.259 --> 05:24:06.627
A SOCIETY. I DON'T THINK THIS

05:24:06.693 --> 05:24:08.428
BILL DOES THAT, BUT I DO APPLAUD

05:24:08.495 --> 05:24:09.997
THE CHAIR FOR AT LEAST TRYING TO

05:24:10.063 --> 05:24:11.698
DO SOMETHING TO SEND THE MESSAGE

05:24:11.765 --> 05:24:13.167
THAT PEOPLE THAT ARE JUST

05:24:13.233 --> 05:24:14.134
EXECUTING THE JOB THAT YOU'VE

05:24:14.201 --> 05:24:15.969
BEEN HIRED TO DO SHOULD NOT HAVE

05:24:16.036 --> 05:24:17.838
TO LEAVE THEIR HOUSE AND WORRY

05:24:17.905 --> 05:24:19.173
ABOUT THEIR PHYSICAL SAFETY.

05:24:19.239 --> 05:24:20.707
THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE. SO I'LL BE

05:24:20.774 --> 05:24:22.543
RECOMMENDING AN AYE. COLLEAGUES,

05:24:22.609 --> 05:24:23.777
THIS WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE

05:24:23.844 --> 05:24:25.279
TIME FOR A MOTION AND A SECOND

05:24:25.345 --> 05:24:27.181
IF THERE IS ONE. SO MOVED MOTION

05:24:27.247 --> 05:24:28.982
BY LACKEY. IS THERE A SECOND?

05:24:29.049 --> 05:24:30.818
OKAY. SECOND BY DOCTOR SHARPE.

05:24:30.884 --> 05:24:32.986
COLLINS. LET'S CALL THE ROLL FOR

05:24:33.053 --> 05:24:35.455
ITEM NUMBER SEVEN SB 431 BY

05:24:35.522 --> 05:24:36.857
SENATOR ARREGUIN. THE MOTION IS

05:24:36.924 --> 05:24:38.625

COLLEAGUES WILL BE LOOKING AT

05:25:07.287 --> 05:25:08.622

THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. MEMBERS

AND PLEASED TO PRESENT SB 524

05:25:24.438 --> 05:25:25.806
WHICH REQUIRE LAW ENFORCEMENT

05:25:25.873 --> 05:25:27.074
AGENCIES CURRENTLY USING

05:25:27.140 --> 05:25:28.876
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE

05:25:28.942 --> 05:25:30.244
REPORT WRITING PROCESS TO

05:25:30.310 --> 05:25:32.012
MAINTAIN A POLICY DISCLOSING

05:25:32.079 --> 05:25:33.380
WHETHER REPORT WAS WRITTEN

05:25:33.447 --> 05:25:35.349
EITHER FULLY OR IN PART USING

05:25:35.415 --> 05:25:39.152
AI, SB 524 SEEKS TO ENSURE

05:25:39.219 --> 05:25:41.321
TRANSPARENCY AND ACCURACY BY

05:25:41.388 --> 05:25:42.756
ADDING CRITICAL GUARDRAILS IN

05:25:42.823 --> 05:25:44.691
THE REPORT WRITING PROCESS AND

05:25:44.758 --> 05:25:46.693
THE PROCESS OF WRITING THIS LAW,

05:25:46.760 --> 05:25:48.395
I WAS SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT

05:25:48.462 --> 05:25:49.730
THERE WAS THERE WAS NO LAW

05:25:49.796 --> 05:25:51.531
THAT'S ACTUALLY EVER BEEN

05:25:51.598 --> 05:25:53.634
ADOPTED AROUND REGULATING THE

05:25:53.700 --> 05:25:55.435
USE OF AI IN THE PROCESS OF

05:25:55.502 --> 05:25:57.237
DEVELOPING POLICE REPORTS IN

05:25:57.304 --> 05:25:58.572
CALIFORNIA. THE EVOLUTION OF

05:25:58.639 --> 05:26:00.107
THIS TECHNOLOGY, I THINK,

05:26:00.173 --> 05:26:02.309
REQUIRES THAT WE HAVE TO PUT IN

05:26:02.376 --> 05:26:03.677
PLACE SOME ESSENTIAL GUARDRAILS,

05:26:03.744 --> 05:26:05.479
BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT WE

05:26:05.545 --> 05:26:07.281
PROVIDE SUFFICIENT FLEXIBILITY

05:26:07.347 --> 05:26:08.382
FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

05:26:08.448 --> 05:26:10.684
AGENCIES TO USE THIS TOOL TO

05:26:10.751 --> 05:26:12.619
ASSIST IN THE WORK THAT THEY DO

05:26:12.686 --> 05:26:17.724
ON A DAILY BASIS. SO LET ME FAST

05:26:17.791 --> 05:26:21.161
FORWARD. YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE

05:26:21.228 --> 05:26:22.729
THAT HUMAN VERIFICATION AND

05:26:22.796 --> 05:26:24.298
JUDGMENT IS STILL NECESSARY IN

05:26:24.364 --> 05:26:26.366
THE USE OF AI. PROSECUTORS,

05:26:26.433 --> 05:26:27.200
DEFENSE ATTORNEYS AND COURTS

05:26:27.267 --> 05:26:29.603
RELY HEAVILY ON POLICE REPORTS

05:26:29.670 --> 05:26:30.737
TO DETERMINE CRIMINAL OUTCOMES,

05:26:30.804 --> 05:26:32.139
AND IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT

05:26:32.205 --> 05:26:34.641
THAT ADDITIONAL TOOLS USED TO

05:26:34.708 --> 05:26:36.376
GENERATE AN OFFICIAL REPORT IS

05:26:36.443 --> 05:26:38.879
ACCURATE TO ENSURE THAT THE

05:26:38.946 --> 05:26:40.380
RIGHT PUBLIC SAFETY OUTCOMES ARE

05:26:40.447 --> 05:26:42.683
ACHIEVED. WE'VE BEEN WORKING

05:26:42.749 --> 05:26:43.784
CLOSELY WITH OPPOSITION TO

05:26:43.850 --> 05:26:45.419
ADDRESS SOME OF THEIR ONGOING

05:26:45.485 --> 05:26:46.320
CONCERNS. WE'VE NARROWED THE

05:26:46.386 --> 05:26:47.721
SCOPE OF WHAT DRAFTS ARE

05:26:47.788 --> 05:26:49.523
REQUIRED TO BE RETAINED. IN

05:26:49.589 --> 05:26:50.724
ADDITION, WE HAVE CLARIFIED THAT

05:26:50.791 --> 05:26:52.960
THE DRAFT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN

05:26:53.026 --> 05:26:54.695
OFFICER'S OFFICIAL STATEMENT. I

05:26:54.761 --> 05:26:55.996
LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO

05:26:56.063 --> 05:26:56.663
WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS,

05:26:56.730 --> 05:26:57.965
INCLUDING OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT

05:26:58.031 --> 05:26:59.633
PARTNERS, TO ADDRESS ANY

05:26:59.700 --> 05:27:00.968
REMAINING CONCERNS ON THE

05:27:01.034 --> 05:27:02.736
IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS BILL AND

05:27:02.803 --> 05:27:04.171
ENSURE WE CAN BALANCE

05:27:04.237 --> 05:27:05.539
TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY

05:27:05.605 --> 05:27:06.807
WITH SUFFICIENT FLEXIBILITY TO

05:27:06.873 --> 05:27:08.308
ENSURE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT

05:27:08.375 --> 05:27:09.910
AGENCIES CAN USE THIS EVER

05:27:09.977 --> 05:27:12.145
EVOLVING TOOL WITH ME TO TESTIFY

05:27:12.212 --> 05:27:15.382
IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. LESLIE

05:27:15.449 --> 05:27:16.750
HOUSTON, A FORMER SOLANO COUNTY

05:27:16.817 --> 05:27:19.353
PUBLIC DEFENDER REPRESENTING THE

05:27:19.419 --> 05:27:21.188
CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDER'S

05:27:21.254 --> 05:27:22.856
ASSOCIATION, AND GLENN BACKUS

05:27:22.923 --> 05:27:27.294
FROM THE PROSECUTOR'S ALLIANCE.

05:27:27.361 --> 05:27:29.296
GOOD AFTERNOON, LESLIE CALDWELL

05:27:29.363 --> 05:27:30.497
HOUSTON, ON BEHALF OF THE

05:27:30.564 --> 05:27:32.299
CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS

05:27:32.366 --> 05:27:33.700
ASSOCIATION, PROUD SPONSOR OF

05:27:33.767 --> 05:27:36.203
THIS BILL. THE BILL'S PURPOSE IS

05:27:36.269 --> 05:27:38.772
VERY SIMPLE. IT'S TO REQUIRE LAW

05:27:38.839 --> 05:27:41.274
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO MAINTAIN

05:27:41.341 --> 05:27:43.744
A POLICY THAT REQUIRES POLICE

05:27:43.810 --> 05:27:45.412
REPORTS TO INCLUDE AN INDICATION

05:27:45.479 --> 05:27:47.714
THAT THE REPORT WAS GENERATED

05:27:47.781 --> 05:27:50.617
USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

05:27:50.684 --> 05:27:52.753
AND TO SPECIFY RETENTION,

05:27:52.819 --> 05:27:54.421
RETENTION REQUIREMENTS FOR

05:27:54.488 --> 05:27:58.158
DRAFTS OF POLICE REPORTS. AI IS

05:27:58.225 --> 05:27:59.760
DEVELOPING SO QUICKLY AND ITS

05:27:59.826 --> 05:28:02.229
USE BECOMING SO WIDESPREAD, WE

05:28:02.295 --> 05:28:04.498
NEED TO HAVE THE GUARDRAILS.

05:28:04.564 --> 05:28:07.167
THERE ARE ALREADY BASIC

05:28:07.234 --> 05:28:08.869
PRINCIPLES IN PLACE ENACTED BY

05:28:08.935 --> 05:28:10.871
THE LEGISLATURE, BUT THERE ARE

05:28:10.937 --> 05:28:13.607
SOME CONCERNS. STILL, I'D LIKE

05:28:13.673 --> 05:28:15.842
TO USE A LITTLE EXAMPLE OF MY

05:28:15.909 --> 05:28:17.644
OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE ON A

05:28:17.711 --> 05:28:23.750
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT AREA TO. TO

05:28:23.817 --> 05:28:25.886
EXPRESS MY CONCERN ABOUT THE

05:28:25.952 --> 05:28:27.287
TRANSPARENCY OF THIS WHOLE

05:28:27.354 --> 05:28:29.122
PROCESS. I WAS IN MY PRIMARY

05:28:29.189 --> 05:28:31.324
CARE DOCTOR'S OFFICE AND WE HAD

05:28:31.391 --> 05:28:33.427
A VERY LENGTHY CONVERSATION.

05:28:33.493 --> 05:28:36.363
THEY USED AI TO GENERATE THEIR

05:28:36.430 --> 05:28:39.599
REPORTS. I KNEW THIS, BUT I

05:28:39.666 --> 05:28:42.169
DIDN'T. SO I WENT BACK TO LOOK

05:28:42.235 --> 05:28:43.570
AT THE REPORT AND HALF OF THE

05:28:43.637 --> 05:28:46.406
STATEMENTS ATTRIBUTED TO ME WERE

05:28:46.473 --> 05:28:48.241
STATEMENTS THAT THE DOCTOR HAD

05:28:48.308 --> 05:28:51.478
MADE, ALSO A WOMAN. SO I WAS

05:28:51.545 --> 05:28:54.314
VERY CONCERNED. AND THIS KIND OF

05:28:54.381 --> 05:28:56.149
DEMONSTRATES WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

05:28:56.216 --> 05:29:01.221
AI IS LISTENING TO OR VIEWING

05:29:01.288 --> 05:29:04.091
DASH CAM OR BODY CAM, THAT KIND

05:29:04.157 --> 05:29:06.993
OF THING. SO THE PROBLEM IS THE

05:29:07.060 --> 05:29:08.161
INDIVIDUAL POLICE REPORTS ARE

05:29:08.228 --> 05:29:10.664
BEING GENERATED USING AI, AND

05:29:10.730 --> 05:29:12.399
NEITHER AN INDIVIDUAL NOR THEIR

05:29:12.466 --> 05:29:14.568
LAWYER OR ANY DEFENSE HAS ANY

05:29:14.634 --> 05:29:17.037
IDEA THAT I WAS BEING USED. WHAT

05:29:17.104 --> 05:29:18.472
PROGRAM WAS USED, WHETHER THE

05:29:18.538 --> 05:29:20.273
POLICE OFFICER OR THEIR

05:29:20.340 --> 05:29:22.776
SUPERIORS HAD REJECTED THE AI

05:29:22.843 --> 05:29:24.177
VERSION AND MADE CHANGES TO THE

05:29:24.244 --> 05:29:26.146
REPORT? AND WHAT THOSE CHANGES

05:29:26.213 --> 05:29:31.051
ARE, AS THE SENATOR SPOKE OF,

05:29:31.118 --> 05:29:33.987
ACCURACY IS IMPERATIVE. THE

05:29:34.054 --> 05:29:36.089
PROSECUTION USES THESE REPORTS

05:29:36.156 --> 05:29:38.658
PRETTY MUCH SOLELY IN ALMOST

05:29:38.725 --> 05:29:41.161
EVERY FILING DECISION. SO WE

05:29:41.228 --> 05:29:44.131
HAVE TO HAVE ACCURACY. SO IT'S

05:29:44.197 --> 05:29:45.899
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT MIGHT HELP

05:29:45.966 --> 05:29:47.334
DETERMINE WHO WAS AT FAULT IN AN

05:29:47.400 --> 05:29:49.436
AUTO ACCIDENT, OR WHETHER AN

05:29:49.503 --> 05:29:51.238
INDIVIDUAL WAS ACTING IN

05:29:51.304 --> 05:29:53.140
SELF-DEFENSE. THIS BILL SOLVES

05:29:53.206 --> 05:29:56.676
THE PROBLEM. IT REQUIRES THAT

05:29:56.743 --> 05:29:59.913
THE EVERYONE THAT'S GOING TO BE

05:29:59.980 --> 05:30:00.981
REVIEWING THAT REPORT WILL KNOW

05:30:01.047 --> 05:30:03.583
I WAS USED AND WHAT CHANGES WERE

05:30:03.650 --> 05:30:07.821
MADE. THERE'S AN AUDIT TRAIL

05:30:07.888 --> 05:30:11.091
BASICALLY, AND SO THAT WOULD

05:30:11.158 --> 05:30:13.560
ENSURE THE TRANSPARENCY AND

05:30:13.627 --> 05:30:14.995
ACCURACY THAT'S NECESSARY. THANK

05:30:15.061 --> 05:30:17.898
YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON, GLENN

05:30:17.964 --> 05:30:19.332
BACKUS FOR PROSECUTORS ALLIANCE

05:30:19.399 --> 05:30:22.235
ACTION. I'LL BE BRIEF. OUR LEGAL

05:30:22.302 --> 05:30:24.738
SYSTEM RELIES ON POLICE REPORTS.

05:30:24.804 --> 05:30:26.540
THEY'RE NOT JUST PAPERWORK. THEY

05:30:26.606 --> 05:30:27.941
ARE SWORN RECOLLECTIONS OF THE

05:30:28.008 --> 05:30:30.443
OFFICER OF WHAT THEY SAW, HEARD

05:30:30.510 --> 05:30:31.945
AND DID. PROSECUTORS MAKE

05:30:32.012 --> 05:30:33.713
DECISIONS BASED ON THESE

05:30:33.780 --> 05:30:35.182
REPORTS? JUDGES CONSIDER THEM.

05:30:35.248 --> 05:30:37.250
JUDGES AND JURIES MAY HEAR THE

05:30:37.317 --> 05:30:39.119
OFFICER'S TESTIMONY AS WELL AND

05:30:39.186 --> 05:30:40.620
DRAW CONCLUSIONS ABOUT

05:30:40.687 --> 05:30:43.190
DISCREPANCIES IF THEY EXIST. THE

05:30:43.256 --> 05:30:45.192
BILL DOES NOT BAN LABOR SAVING

05:30:45.258 --> 05:30:47.327
AI, BUT IT DOES REQUIRE THAT THE

05:30:47.394 --> 05:30:48.528
RESPONSIBLE OFFICER WHO WAS

05:30:48.595 --> 05:30:50.897
PRESENT AT THE SCENE, OR PERHAPS

05:30:50.964 --> 05:30:53.266
SPOKE TO WITNESSES, DEFENDANT OR

05:30:53.333 --> 05:30:55.035
VICTIM TO SIGN THE REPORT

05:30:55.101 --> 05:30:56.536
ATTESTING TO ITS ACCURACY. THAT

05:30:56.603 --> 05:30:58.605
IS NOT ONEROUS. IT'S COMPLETELY

05:30:58.672 --> 05:31:00.073
APPROPRIATE. THE BILL ALSO

05:31:00.140 --> 05:31:01.708
REQUIRES NOTATION ON THE PAGES

05:31:01.775 --> 05:31:03.577
WHERE I WAS USED. THAT CAN BE

05:31:03.643 --> 05:31:04.945
HELPFUL TO THE PROSECUTION AND

05:31:05.011 --> 05:31:06.713
THE DEFENSE IN MAKING SURE THAT

05:31:06.780 --> 05:31:07.714
THE INFORMATION IS FULLY

05:31:07.781 --> 05:31:09.249
ACCURATE. IT'S NOT ONEROUS, BUT

05:31:09.316 --> 05:31:11.151
IT'S URGENTLY NEEDED. THE STAKES

05:31:11.218 --> 05:31:12.352
ARE HIGH FOR THE WELL-BEING OF

05:31:12.419 --> 05:31:13.453
VICTIMS, THE RIGHTS OF THE

05:31:13.520 --> 05:31:15.522
ACCUSED, AND THE CREDIBILITY OF

05:31:15.589 --> 05:31:16.690
OUR LEGAL SYSTEM. PROSECUTORS

05:31:16.756 --> 05:31:19.159
ALLIANCE ACTION SUPPORTS. ALL

05:31:19.226 --> 05:31:20.160

05:31:22.362 --> 05:31:23.797
TESTIMONY. NOW WE'LL GO TO THE

BUT NO THANK YOU. AND YOU KNOW,

05:32:40.607 --> 05:32:42.942
HERE IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO

05:32:43.009 --> 05:32:45.178
THE SENATOR'S BILL, I'D ACTUALLY

05:32:45.245 --> 05:32:46.179
CHARACTERIZE MORE AS OPPOSE

05:32:46.246 --> 05:32:46.946
UNLESS AMENDED. I THINK WE'RE

05:32:47.013 --> 05:32:48.882
GETTING REALLY, REALLY CLOSE ON

05:32:48.948 --> 05:32:50.183
THIS ONE AND APPRECIATE ALL THE

05:32:50.250 --> 05:32:51.217
AMENDMENTS, NOT JUST MOVING FROM

05:32:51.284 --> 05:32:53.019
THE ORIGINAL VERSION THAT

05:32:53.086 --> 05:32:54.254
REQUIRED COLLECTION OF EVERY

05:32:54.321 --> 05:32:55.655
SINGLE DRAFT, THE FIRST AND LAST

05:32:55.722 --> 05:32:57.691
DRAFT NOW. BUT THE LINE IN THE

05:32:57.757 --> 05:32:59.459
BILL THROUGH THE COMMITTEE ABOUT

05:32:59.526 --> 05:33:00.593
THIS NOT CONSTITUTING AN

05:33:00.660 --> 05:33:01.895
OFFICER'S OFFICIAL STATEMENT

05:33:01.961 --> 05:33:03.830
BECAUSE TO THE PROPONENTS

05:33:03.897 --> 05:33:05.699
ARGUMENTS, YOU KNOW, THAT IS ONE

05:33:05.765 --> 05:33:06.666
OF OUR CONCERNS, RIGHT? BECAUSE

05:33:06.733 --> 05:33:08.001
THE SYSTEMS ARE NOT ENTIRELY

05:33:08.068 --> 05:33:09.636
ACCURATE AND THEY MAY BLEED OVER

05:33:09.703 --> 05:33:10.704
BETWEEN WHAT ONE PERSON SAID AND

05:33:10.770 --> 05:33:12.839
ANOTHER SAID. AND I WANT TO MAKE

05:33:12.906 --> 05:33:14.107
SURE THAT THE OFFICIAL RECORD

05:33:14.174 --> 05:33:15.108
THAT GOES INTO THE COURTROOM

05:33:15.175 --> 05:33:16.109
PROCEEDINGS IS ACCURATE AND IS

05:33:16.176 --> 05:33:17.944
SIGNED OFF BY THE OFFICER, WHICH

05:33:18.011 --> 05:33:19.746
WAS ANOTHER GOOD AMENDMENT PUT

05:33:19.813 --> 05:33:20.847
INTO THE BILL. SO, YOU KNOW, WE

05:33:20.914 --> 05:33:22.649
CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN

05:33:22.716 --> 05:33:24.517
UTILIZE THESE TOOLS IN A WAY

05:33:24.584 --> 05:33:26.086
THAT DOESN'T JEOPARDIZE PUBLIC

05:33:26.152 --> 05:33:29.089
TRUST, DOESN'T COMPROMISE THE

05:33:29.155 --> 05:33:30.490
INTEGRITY OF THE CRIMINAL

05:33:30.557 --> 05:33:33.059
JUSTICE SYSTEM. WE DO HAVE SOME

05:33:33.126 --> 05:33:34.160
ADDITIONAL CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS

05:33:34.227 --> 05:33:35.995
THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEEK. BUT I

05:33:36.062 --> 05:33:37.430
FEEL LIKE AT THIS POINT, THE WAY

05:33:37.497 --> 05:33:38.665
THINGS HAVE PROGRESSED AND THE

05:33:38.732 --> 05:33:39.966
POSITIVE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE

05:33:40.033 --> 05:33:41.334
HAD, THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE

05:33:41.401 --> 05:33:43.503
TO GET THERE ON THIS ONE. SO

05:33:43.570 --> 05:33:44.637
RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT YOU

05:33:44.704 --> 05:33:47.140
CONSIDER ALL OF THAT AND LOOK

05:33:47.207 --> 05:33:48.808
FORWARD TO CONTINUING THESE

05:33:48.875 --> 05:33:50.777

05:33:56.883 --> 05:33:59.018
WAS A MASTERCLASS, FOLKS. LET'S

THE ONGOING DIALOG WITH NOT ONLY

THE CHIEFS, BUT PORAC AND OTHER

05:34:39.759 --> 05:34:41.728
LAW ENFORCEMENT STAKEHOLDERS. I

05:34:41.795 --> 05:34:42.829
UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS. YOU

05:34:42.896 --> 05:34:44.330
WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE ARE

05:34:44.397 --> 05:34:45.832
PROTECTIONS SO THAT POLICE

05:34:45.899 --> 05:34:47.700
OFFICERS ARE USING THIS TOOL FOR

05:34:47.767 --> 05:34:49.202
LEGITIMATE PURPOSES, DON'T GET

05:34:49.269 --> 05:34:50.437
TRIPPED UP. BUT AT THE SAME

05:34:50.503 --> 05:34:51.905
TIME, IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE

05:34:51.971 --> 05:34:53.406
HAVE GUARDRAILS IN PLACE. SO I'M

05:34:53.473 --> 05:34:55.108
CONFIDENT WE'LL CONTINUE TO WORK

05:34:55.175 --> 05:34:56.709
TOWARDS ACHIEVING A RESOLUTION

05:34:56.776 --> 05:34:59.813
THAT CAN ACCOMPLISH BOTH THOSE

05:34:59.879 --> 05:35:01.181
GOALS. WITH THAT, I RESPECTFULLY

05:35:01.247 --> 05:35:03.082
ASK FOR NÃI VOTE. THANK YOU, MR.

05:35:03.149 --> 05:35:05.084
CHAIR. I WILL BE RECOMMENDING AN

05:35:05.151 --> 05:35:05.985
AYE, AND I JUST WANT TO

05:35:06.052 --> 05:35:07.754
COMPLIMENT YOU. I THINK IT'S A

05:35:07.821 --> 05:35:08.855
GREAT BILL. I KNOW IT'S NOT

05:35:08.922 --> 05:35:10.557
FULLY THERE YET. I'M SURE THE

05:35:10.623 --> 05:35:11.858
CONVERSATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO

05:35:11.925 --> 05:35:13.026
HAPPEN, BUT I ACTUALLY WANTED TO

05:35:13.092 --> 05:35:14.427
ECHO SOMETHING I HEARD FROM MISS

05:35:14.494 --> 05:35:16.296
CALDWELL, HOUSTON WHEN I WAS A

05:35:16.362 --> 05:35:17.931
PROSECUTOR, I RELIED ON ON

05:35:17.997 --> 05:35:18.565
REPORTS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM

05:35:18.631 --> 05:35:19.532
FILING DECISIONS TO PRELIMINARY

05:35:19.599 --> 05:35:21.434
HEARING PREPARATION. MY CONCERN

05:35:21.501 --> 05:35:23.002
GOES BOTH WAYS. I WANT TO MAKE

05:35:23.069 --> 05:35:24.704
SURE THAT THOSE REPORTS

05:35:24.771 --> 05:35:25.738
ACCURATELY REFLECT WHAT THE

05:35:25.805 --> 05:35:27.540
OFFICER, TO THE BEST OF THEIR

05:35:27.607 --> 05:35:28.942
THEIR RECOLLECTION, OBSERVED. I

05:35:29.008 --> 05:35:31.511
ALSO WANT TO ENSURE THAT IF I

05:35:31.578 --> 05:35:33.046
WAS USED, THAT'S DISCLOSED

05:35:33.112 --> 05:35:34.047
BECAUSE THEN AT LEAST WE CAN

05:35:34.113 --> 05:35:35.148
TEST THOSE STATEMENTS AND WHAT

05:35:35.215 --> 05:35:37.050
WAS OBSERVED IN THE JUDICIAL

05:35:37.116 --> 05:35:38.785
PROCESS. I VIEW THIS AS REALLY A

05:35:38.852 --> 05:35:40.086
CRITICAL PROTECTION FOR BOTH THE

05:35:40.153 --> 05:35:41.521

05:35:41.588 --> 05:35:42.255

ASSEMBLYMEMBER GONZALEZ HAS

SIMILAR LEGISLATION AIMING TO

PREVIOUSLY SHELTERING IN THEM.

05:37:52.452 --> 05:37:53.186
SOMETIMES THEY'RE BEING

05:37:53.252 --> 05:37:55.421
PURCHASED BY PEOPLE AT A VERY

05:38:02.595 --> 05:38:04.397
VEHICLES ARE IN SUCH POOR

05:38:04.464 --> 05:38:05.531
CONDITION AND POSE SUCH SERIOUS

05:38:05.598 --> 05:38:07.400
HEALTH AND SAFETY RISKS THAT

05:38:07.467 --> 05:38:08.768
LOCAL TOWING COMPANIES SIMPLY

05:38:08.835 --> 05:38:11.304
REFUSE TO TAKE THEM. DUE TO THE

05:38:11.371 --> 05:38:12.372
PRESCRIPTIVE REQUIREMENTS IN

05:38:12.438 --> 05:38:14.173
EXISTING LAW, LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

05:38:14.240 --> 05:38:16.009
HAVE VERY FEW OPTIONS TO ABATE

05:38:16.075 --> 05:38:17.844
AND REMOVE THEM. UNDER EXISTING

05:38:17.910 --> 05:38:19.245
LAW, LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE

05:38:19.312 --> 05:38:20.213
REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A TEN DAY

05:38:20.279 --> 05:38:22.081
NOTICE THAT THE VEHICLE WILL BE

05:38:22.148 --> 05:38:23.883
REMOVED AND, UNLESS SPECIFIC

05:38:23.950 --> 05:38:25.118
REQUIREMENTS ARE MET AS

05:38:25.184 --> 05:38:27.654
SPECIFIED IN STATUTE, SB 692

05:38:27.720 --> 05:38:29.288
WOULD AMEND THE CURRENT

05:38:29.355 --> 05:38:30.356
REQUIREMENT FOR LOCAL

05:38:30.423 --> 05:38:32.358
GOVERNMENTS TO BE ABLE TO REMOVE

05:38:32.425 --> 05:38:33.593
ABANDONED AND INOPERABLE

05:38:33.660 --> 05:38:35.428
VEHICLES VALUED AT LESS THAN

05:38:35.495 --> 05:38:37.296
$200, BY REQUIRING THAT THE

05:38:37.363 --> 05:38:38.598
LOCAL GOVERNMENT EITHER

05:38:38.665 --> 05:38:40.466
DETERMINES THAT THE VEHICLE BE

05:38:40.533 --> 05:38:42.335
IS A PUBLIC NUISANCE, PRESENTING

05:38:42.402 --> 05:38:43.603
AN IMMINENT THREAT TO PUBLIC

05:38:43.670 --> 05:38:45.905
HEALTH OR SAFETY, OR A PROPERTY

05:38:45.972 --> 05:38:48.041
OR SIGNS A RELEASE ALLOWING FOR

05:38:48.107 --> 05:38:50.910
THE REMOVAL OF THAT VEHICLE.

05:38:50.977 --> 05:38:52.845
CURRENT LAW REQUIRES BOTH HEALTH

05:38:52.912 --> 05:38:55.314
AND SAFETY, AS WELL AS A SIGNED

05:38:55.381 --> 05:38:57.150
RELEASE IN ORDER TO REMOVE THAT

05:38:57.216 --> 05:38:58.518
VEHICLE. THIS IS ALLOWING EITHER

05:38:58.584 --> 05:39:01.287
OR OPTION. IN INSTANCES WHEN A

05:39:01.354 --> 05:39:02.855
VEHICLE IS ABANDONED, IT CAN BE

05:39:02.922 --> 05:39:04.390
VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND THE OWNER

05:39:04.457 --> 05:39:05.792
OF AN ABANDONED VEHICLE TO BE

05:39:05.858 --> 05:39:08.227
ABLE TO COMPLY WITH THE EXISTING

05:39:08.294 --> 05:39:09.262
REQUIREMENTS OF THE STATUTE.

05:39:09.328 --> 05:39:10.430
ADDITIONALLY, COMMITTEE

05:39:10.496 --> 05:39:11.097
REQUIREMENTS COMMITTEE

05:39:11.164 --> 05:39:12.231
AMENDMENTS CLARIFY THAT THE

05:39:12.298 --> 05:39:14.734
EXISTING PROCESSES THAT A LOCAL

05:39:14.801 --> 05:39:15.635
GOVERNMENTS FOLLOW TO ABATE

05:39:15.702 --> 05:39:17.937
ABANDONED VEHICLES ALSO APPLY TO

05:39:18.004 --> 05:39:20.440
INOPERABLE VEHICLES OR THE OR

05:39:20.506 --> 05:39:22.275
PARTS THAT ARE POSING AN

05:39:22.341 --> 05:39:23.710
IMMINENT HEALTH AND SAFETY

05:39:23.776 --> 05:39:25.044
THREAT. WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY

05:39:25.111 --> 05:39:26.512
CLOSELY WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS,

05:39:26.579 --> 05:39:28.247
INCLUDING OPPOSITION, THROUGHOUT

05:39:28.314 --> 05:39:30.116
THE PROCESS TO ADDRESS CONCERNS.

05:39:30.183 --> 05:39:31.984
I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE

05:39:32.051 --> 05:39:33.820
ACLU AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO

05:39:33.886 --> 05:39:35.655
MAKE SURE THAT THIS BILL IS

05:39:35.722 --> 05:39:36.989
FOCUSED SPECIFICALLY ON

05:39:37.056 --> 05:39:38.858
ABANDONED AND INOPERABLE

05:39:38.925 --> 05:39:40.259
VEHICLES, NOT VEHICLES THAT ARE

05:39:40.326 --> 05:39:41.627
BEING USED AS SHELTER. THAT'S

05:39:41.694 --> 05:39:44.097
NOT THE GOAL. WITH ME TO TESTIFY

05:39:44.163 --> 05:39:45.631
IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS PETER

05:39:45.698 --> 05:39:47.734
RADU, ASSISTANT TO THE CITY

05:39:47.800 --> 05:39:48.267
MANAGER FOR NEIGHBORHOOD

05:39:48.334 --> 05:39:50.236
SERVICES AT MY FORMER JOB, THE

05:39:50.303 --> 05:39:51.671
CITY OF BERKELEY. GOOD TO SEE

05:39:51.738 --> 05:39:52.972
YOU AND NICCOLO DELUCA ON BEHALF

05:39:53.039 --> 05:39:54.741
OF THE CITY OF OAKLAND. THANK

05:39:54.807 --> 05:39:56.075
YOU, MR. SENATOR, AND THANK YOU,

05:39:56.142 --> 05:39:57.910
MR. CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS,

05:39:57.977 --> 05:39:59.145
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. MY NAME IS

05:39:59.212 --> 05:40:01.214
PETER RADU FOR THE CITY OF

05:40:01.280 --> 05:40:01.814
BERKELEY. I OVERSEE HOMELESS

05:40:01.881 --> 05:40:03.516
POLICY AS WELL AS ENCAMPMENT

05:40:03.583 --> 05:40:05.852
RESPONSE. THE CITY OF BERKELEY

05:40:05.918 --> 05:40:06.953
HAS TAKEN GREAT STRIDES OVER THE

05:40:07.019 --> 05:40:09.355
PAST SEVERAL YEARS TO USE STATE

05:40:09.422 --> 05:40:11.224
DOLLARS AND LOCAL DOLLARS TO

05:40:11.290 --> 05:40:12.225
MAKE MEASURABLE IMPACTS IN OUR

05:40:12.291 --> 05:40:13.593
HOMELESS ENCAMPMENT SITUATION,

05:40:13.659 --> 05:40:14.794
WE'VE DECREASED UNSHELTERED

05:40:14.861 --> 05:40:17.330
HOMELESSNESS BY 45% IN THE LAST

05:40:17.396 --> 05:40:19.499
TWO YEARS, AND RECENTLY WE USED

05:40:19.565 --> 05:40:20.933
STATE ENCAMPMENT RESOLUTION

05:40:21.000 --> 05:40:22.769
FUNDING TO PILOT A VERY

05:40:22.835 --> 05:40:24.137
SUCCESSFUL AND INNOVATIVE RV

05:40:24.203 --> 05:40:26.105
BUYBACK PROGRAM, WHERE WE WERE

05:40:26.172 --> 05:40:27.006
ABLE TO TACKLE ONE OF OUR

05:40:27.073 --> 05:40:28.574
LARGEST ENCAMPMENTS IN WEST

05:40:28.641 --> 05:40:31.277
BERKELEY AND SUCCESSFULLY MOVE

05:40:31.344 --> 05:40:32.879
THE OCCUPANTS. OUT OF 29 OF 29

05:40:32.945 --> 05:40:35.348
OF THE 30 LARGE, INOPERATIVE AND

05:40:35.414 --> 05:40:36.749
PROBLEMATIC NUISANCE VEHICLES

05:40:36.816 --> 05:40:38.251
THAT WERE FORMERLY BEING USED AS

05:40:38.317 --> 05:40:40.019
SHELTER THERE SAFELY INTO

05:40:40.086 --> 05:40:41.854
INTERIM HOUSING. I'M NOT HERE TO

05:40:41.921 --> 05:40:43.289
TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT SUCCESS,

05:40:43.356 --> 05:40:44.690
THOUGH. TODAY I'M HERE TO TALK

05:40:44.757 --> 05:40:46.025
TO YOU ABOUT THE GREAT

05:40:46.092 --> 05:40:47.426
CHALLENGES WE RAN INTO RAN INTO

05:40:47.493 --> 05:40:49.328
REMOVING THOSE VEHICLES FROM THE

05:40:49.395 --> 05:40:50.396
STREET, EVEN AFTER WE HAD SAFELY

05:40:50.463 --> 05:40:52.231
MOVED THEIR OCCUPANTS INTO

05:40:52.298 --> 05:40:52.965
HOUSING FOR WEEKS AND MONTHS.

05:40:53.032 --> 05:40:55.067
AND AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED, WE

05:40:55.134 --> 05:40:57.637
COULD NOT GET OUR TOW COMPANIES

05:40:57.703 --> 05:41:00.139
TO AGREE TO TAKE THEM. THEY WERE

05:41:00.206 --> 05:41:02.775
CITING ISSUES SUCH AS THE

05:41:02.842 --> 05:41:04.010
CONDITION OF THE VEHICLE, HEALTH

05:41:04.076 --> 05:41:05.144
HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

05:41:05.211 --> 05:41:07.213
VEHICLE LIKE RAT INFESTATIONS,

05:41:07.280 --> 05:41:09.115
ETC. REASONS THAT THEY COULD NOT

05:41:09.182 --> 05:41:10.349
ACCEPT THEM INTO THEIR IMPOUND

05:41:10.416 --> 05:41:12.385
YARD. AND SO WE WERE STUCK IN,

05:41:12.451 --> 05:41:14.153
THE VEHICLES WERE EMPTY AND THEY

05:41:14.220 --> 05:41:16.322
WERE LEFT BEHIND, AND THEY WERE

05:41:16.389 --> 05:41:17.423
CLEARLY POSING NUISANCE

05:41:17.490 --> 05:41:19.625
CONDITIONS FOR OUR COMMUNITY.

05:41:19.692 --> 05:41:20.993
AND YET WE COULD DO NOTHING

05:41:21.060 --> 05:41:22.562
REALLY, TO REMOVE THEM BECAUSE

05:41:22.628 --> 05:41:24.096
OF THE CONSTRAINTS THAT WERE

05:41:24.163 --> 05:41:26.265
PLACED UPON US BY STATE LAW. IF

05:41:26.332 --> 05:41:27.066
I COULD PUT THIS DIFFERENTLY AND

05:41:27.133 --> 05:41:28.601
IN BLUNT TERMS, A LOCAL

05:41:28.668 --> 05:41:31.137
GOVERNMENT WOULD LIKE BERKELEY

05:41:31.204 --> 05:41:32.939
WAS UNABLE TO PRODUCE THE

05:41:33.005 --> 05:41:34.340
MEASURABLE AND VISIBLE

05:41:34.407 --> 05:41:35.007
ACCOUNTABILITY THAT WE KNOW THAT

05:41:35.074 --> 05:41:37.076
THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE ARE

05:41:37.143 --> 05:41:38.678
DEMANDING OF US TO SEE, WITH

05:41:38.744 --> 05:41:40.213
RESPECT TO HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS

05:41:40.279 --> 05:41:41.247
AND CLEANING UP OUR STREETS.

05:41:41.314 --> 05:41:41.881
BECAUSE OF THIS CONSTRAINT AND

05:41:41.948 --> 05:41:44.350
EXISTING STATE LAW. SO SB 692

05:41:44.417 --> 05:41:46.319
WOULD REPRESENT A FIX TO THAT

05:41:46.385 --> 05:41:48.454
CONSTRAINT IN THAT BARRIER.

05:41:48.521 --> 05:41:50.089
CALIFORNIA LAW CURRENTLY ALREADY

05:41:50.156 --> 05:41:51.724
DELEGATES BROAD AUTHORITY TO

05:41:51.791 --> 05:41:53.693
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DEFINE,

05:41:53.759 --> 05:41:56.462
RESPOND TO DECLARE NUISANCES,

05:41:56.529 --> 05:41:58.064
BUT THAT AUTHORITY CURRENTLY

05:41:58.130 --> 05:42:01.367
ONLY EXTENDS TO PROPERTY THAT IS

05:42:01.434 --> 05:42:05.238
NOT ON WHEELS. SB 692, REALLY AT

05:42:05.304 --> 05:42:07.473
ITS CORE, CREATES LOGICAL AND

05:42:07.540 --> 05:42:09.308
LEGAL PARITY BETWEEN HOW WE

05:42:09.375 --> 05:42:11.344
RESPOND TO NUISANCES, WHETHER OR

05:42:11.410 --> 05:42:13.145
NOT THAT NUISANCE HAPPENS TO

05:42:13.212 --> 05:42:16.249
OCCUR ON WHEELS OR NOT. PUT

05:42:16.315 --> 05:42:17.516
DIFFERENTLY, IF A LOCAL FIRE

05:42:17.583 --> 05:42:19.619
MARSHAL OR A HEALTH OFFICER

05:42:19.685 --> 05:42:21.153
DECLARES PROPERTY TO BE

05:42:21.220 --> 05:42:22.822
HAZARDOUS TO PUBLIC SAFETY, WE

05:42:22.889 --> 05:42:25.358
AS A STATE SHOULD RESPECT THEIR

05:42:25.424 --> 05:42:27.026
AUTHORITY TO ORDER THAT THAT

05:42:27.093 --> 05:42:28.361
HAZARD BE MITIGATED, AND WE

05:42:28.427 --> 05:42:29.762
SHOULD NOT BE PARSING THAT

05:42:29.829 --> 05:42:31.297
AUTHORITY BY WHETHER THE HAZARD

05:42:31.364 --> 05:42:33.366
HAPPENS TO BE A VEHICLE OR NOT.

05:42:33.432 --> 05:42:35.201
SO AS YOU CONSIDER YOUR VOTE ON

05:42:35.268 --> 05:42:36.335
THIS BILL TODAY, HONORABLE

05:42:36.402 --> 05:42:38.004
COMMITTEE MEMBERS, I WOULD

05:42:38.070 --> 05:42:38.871
RESPECTFULLY URGE YOU TO

05:42:38.938 --> 05:42:41.007
CONSIDER NOT JUST THE

05:42:41.073 --> 05:42:42.308
HYPOTHETICAL ACTIONS THAT SOME

05:42:42.375 --> 05:42:43.876
THEORETICAL BAD ACTOR MIGHT USE

05:42:43.943 --> 05:42:45.311
TO ABUSE THIS, BUT ALSO CONSIDER

05:42:45.378 --> 05:42:47.346
THE KNOWN GOOD ACTORS LIKE

05:42:47.413 --> 05:42:49.282
BERKELEY, THAT ARE USING STATE

05:42:49.348 --> 05:42:51.417
DOLLARS TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE

05:42:51.484 --> 05:42:52.385
DEMANDS THAT THE PUBLIC ARE,

05:42:52.451 --> 05:42:54.086
THAT THE PUBLIC IS MAKING OF US

05:42:54.153 --> 05:42:56.188
TO CLEAN UP OUR STREETS AND TO

05:42:56.255 --> 05:42:57.890
RESOLVE ENCAMPMENTS. AND I'M

05:42:57.957 --> 05:43:00.026
ASKING ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF

05:43:00.092 --> 05:43:01.160
BERKELEY, WHO VOTED UNANIMOUSLY

05:43:01.227 --> 05:43:03.863
IN SUPPORT OF THIS FOR YOUR

05:43:03.930 --> 05:43:06.532
SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU

HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF

05:43:10.903 --> 05:43:12.672
OAKLAND. I'LL BE I'LL BE BRIEF,

REALLY WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR

THE OPPOSITION FOR THEIR

05:43:19.512 --> 05:43:20.479
FEEDBACK. LONG STORY SHORT,

05:43:20.546 --> 05:43:21.814
WE'RE REALLY PROUD OF OUR

ABANDONED AUTOS A YEAR. SOME CAN

BE TOWED, SOME CAN'T. JUST

05:43:33.559 --> 05:43:35.061
YESTERDAY I WAS IN WEST OAKLAND

05:43:35.127 --> 05:43:36.896
ON A TOUR. WEST OAKLAND IS A

05:43:36.963 --> 05:43:38.130
PROUD PART OF TOWN. WE DROVE

05:43:38.197 --> 05:43:39.832
AROUND AND SO MANY RESIDENTS AND

05:43:39.899 --> 05:43:41.300
BUSINESS OWNERS WERE SAYING,

05:43:41.367 --> 05:43:42.168
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. WE HAVE THESE

ABANDONED RVS, THESE CARS WHERE

05:43:44.036 --> 05:43:45.571
OUR CUSTOMERS DON'T WANT TO COME

05:43:45.638 --> 05:43:47.006

REALLY GOING TO HELP OAKLAND,

05:46:14.720 --> 05:46:17.423

SAY I'VE NOT SEEN THAT IN A LONG

05:46:27.800 --> 05:46:28.334
TIME WHERE YOU HAD OPPOSITION

05:46:28.400 --> 05:46:30.669
ALL COME UP TO SAY THAT THEY'RE

05:46:30.736 --> 05:46:31.871
DROPPING AND GOING TO A NEUTRAL.

05:46:31.937 --> 05:46:32.872
THIS IS A REALLY GOOD BILL. I

05:46:32.938 --> 05:46:36.008
THINK WE DEAL WITH THIS IN ALL

05:46:36.075 --> 05:46:37.209
OF OUR CITIES, WHERE WE'VE GOT

05:46:37.276 --> 05:46:38.410
CITIES THAT ARE LINED UP WITH

05:46:38.477 --> 05:46:39.912
CARS THAT ARE ABANDONED, AND

05:46:39.979 --> 05:46:42.081
THEY JUST SIT THERE AND THEY SIT

05:46:42.148 --> 05:46:42.882
THERE AND WE ALL TRY TO CALL TO

05:46:42.948 --> 05:46:45.117
SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO GET IT

05:46:45.184 --> 05:46:46.652
FIXED. AND THERE ARE SO MANY

05:46:46.719 --> 05:46:47.786
REGULATIONS OR PROCESS THAT

05:46:47.853 --> 05:46:50.022
TAKES PLACE THAT IT MAKES IT

05:46:50.089 --> 05:46:50.589
ALMOST DIFFICULT. BUT WHAT

05:46:50.656 --> 05:46:52.124
HAPPENS MORE SO THAN ANYTHING IS

05:46:52.191 --> 05:46:53.225
THAT ONE CAR IS THERE, AND THEN

05:46:53.292 --> 05:46:55.728
EVERYBODY USES THAT AS A MARKER

05:46:55.794 --> 05:46:56.762
TO BE ABLE TO DROP EVEN MORE

05:46:56.829 --> 05:46:57.963
CARS THERE. AND SO THIS IS GOING

05:46:58.030 --> 05:47:00.833
TO REALLY FIX THAT. AND NOT JUST

05:47:00.900 --> 05:47:02.434
YOUR CITIES, BUT I THINK ALL OF

05:47:02.501 --> 05:47:04.170
US DEAL WITH THIS. AND SO I'M

05:47:04.236 --> 05:47:06.105
VERY HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL

05:47:06.172 --> 05:47:07.273
MOVING THE BILL AND WOULD LIKE

05:47:07.339 --> 05:47:09.742
TO BE ADDED AS A COAUTHOR IF

05:47:09.808 --> 05:47:11.310
THIS BILL MAKES IT OUT HERE.

05:47:11.377 --> 05:47:13.779
THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.

05:47:13.846 --> 05:47:14.947
AND I'LL JUST NOTE WE HAVE A

05:47:15.014 --> 05:47:17.283
MOTION. IS THERE A SECOND? OKAY.

05:47:17.349 --> 05:47:18.717
WE HAVE A MOTION IN A SECOND.

05:47:18.784 --> 05:47:20.319
WE'LL KEEP GOING. ASSEMBLYMEMBER

05:47:20.386 --> 05:47:21.053
GONZALEZ, I JUST WANT TO THANK

05:47:21.120 --> 05:47:22.788
THE AUTHOR AS HIS REFERENCE TO

05:47:22.855 --> 05:47:24.523
SIMILAR BILLS. I HAVE AB 630.

05:47:24.590 --> 05:47:25.558
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT

05:47:25.624 --> 05:47:27.059
BILL AND ALSO WORKING WITH

05:47:27.126 --> 05:47:27.960
OPPOSITION ON THAT IN BOTH

05:47:28.027 --> 05:47:28.961
RESPECTIVE HOUSES. AND I JUST

05:47:29.028 --> 05:47:31.063
WANTED TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR

05:47:31.130 --> 05:47:32.765
THAT. BUT I ALSO WANTED JUST TO

05:47:32.831 --> 05:47:34.466
ADDRESS PART OF OUR

05:47:34.533 --> 05:47:35.100
CONVERSATION, WHY WE'VE WORKED

05:47:35.167 --> 05:47:36.802
ON OUR BILLS TOGETHER ON THAT.

05:47:36.869 --> 05:47:38.437
AND I'M ALSO A COAUTHOR OF THAT,

05:47:38.504 --> 05:47:40.005
IS THAT OUR GOAL HERE IS TO

05:47:40.072 --> 05:47:41.207
RECOGNIZE THAT NO ONE'S HOME

05:47:41.273 --> 05:47:42.775
SHOULD BE A HAZARD AND THAT

05:47:42.841 --> 05:47:43.842
OFTENTIMES THESE THESE RVS ARE

05:47:43.909 --> 05:47:46.412
USUALLY USED FOR PREDATORY

05:47:46.478 --> 05:47:48.013
LANDLORDS, WHO THEN THEN RECYCLE

05:47:48.080 --> 05:47:49.582
THEM AND GO BACK INTO THE

05:47:49.648 --> 05:47:50.816
COMMUNITY. THEY'RE AUCTIONED OFF

05:47:50.883 --> 05:47:52.151
OFTENTIMES FOR 50 BUCKS. AND THE

05:47:52.218 --> 05:47:53.686
REALITY IS IT'S A PROBLEM.

05:47:53.752 --> 05:47:55.221
ACROSS THE STATE. WE'VE SEEN

05:47:55.287 --> 05:47:56.222
HUMAN TRAFFICKING, PROSTITUTION,

05:47:56.288 --> 05:47:58.023
DRUG RINGS AND SO FORTH. SO THE

05:47:58.090 --> 05:48:00.159
GOAL HERE IS TO CONTINUE TO WORK

05:48:00.226 --> 05:48:01.727
WITH OPPOSITION, BUT TO ALSO

05:48:01.794 --> 05:48:03.028
RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE TO DO

05:48:03.095 --> 05:48:04.830
BETTER, BETTER AND MORE ON

05:48:04.897 --> 05:48:06.332
WRAPAROUND SERVICES AND GETTING

05:48:06.398 --> 05:48:07.833
FOLKS OUT OF THOSE RVS AND

05:48:07.900 --> 05:48:09.501
ACTUALLY INTO HOUSING. AND SO I

05:48:09.568 --> 05:48:10.903
KNOW THAT WE ARE BOTH COMMITTED

05:48:10.970 --> 05:48:12.805
TO THAT AS WELL. BUT THIS IS A

05:48:12.871 --> 05:48:14.340
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION,

05:48:14.406 --> 05:48:14.940
ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE THAT ARE

05:48:15.007 --> 05:48:17.009
PARKED AROUND SCHOOLS AND

05:48:17.076 --> 05:48:18.244
CHURCHES AND PLACES OF WORSHIP.

05:48:18.310 --> 05:48:20.079
SO THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR

05:48:20.145 --> 05:48:20.646
THAT. THANK YOU SIR. DOCTOR

05:48:20.713 --> 05:48:22.147
SHARPE COLLINS FLOOR IS YOURS.

05:48:22.214 --> 05:48:24.950
WITH THE LAST OF MY VOICE, I

05:48:25.017 --> 05:48:26.852
WANTED TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR AS

05:48:26.919 --> 05:48:29.188
WELL FOR ALL OF YOUR HARD WORK.

05:48:29.255 --> 05:48:30.789
I DO APPRECIATE YOU WORKING WITH

05:48:30.856 --> 05:48:32.291
THE OPPOSITION TO GET THEM

05:48:32.358 --> 05:48:33.993
NEUTRAL, SO THAT WAY WE CAN

05:48:34.059 --> 05:48:36.562
ADDRESS SOME OTHER THINGS. I DO

05:48:36.629 --> 05:48:38.464
HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TWO OF

05:48:38.530 --> 05:48:40.466
THE PROVISIONS THAT IS IN HERE.

05:48:40.532 --> 05:48:41.834
ONE OF THEM IS THAT THERE WAS NO

05:48:41.900 --> 05:48:44.436
DEFINITION OF ABANDONED. SO HOW

05:48:44.503 --> 05:48:46.272
WILL WE ENSURE THAT A CAR IS

05:48:46.338 --> 05:48:47.306
ACTUALLY ABANDONED? THAT'S

05:48:47.373 --> 05:48:48.841
QUESTION NUMBER ONE. YEAH. I

05:48:48.907 --> 05:48:49.842
THINK THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS

05:48:49.908 --> 05:48:53.579
TOUCHED UPON THIS. THAT RIGHT

05:48:53.646 --> 05:48:55.614
NOW IT'S UP TO THE DISCRETION OF

05:48:55.681 --> 05:48:58.884
THE OF THE ENFORCING OFFICER TO

05:48:58.951 --> 05:49:00.319
DETERMINE WHETHER SOMETHING IS

05:49:00.386 --> 05:49:02.721
ABANDONED OR NOT ABANDONED. AND

05:49:02.788 --> 05:49:04.523
THAT'S JUST CURRENT LAW. THAT'S

05:49:04.590 --> 05:49:06.458
CURRENT PRACTICE. CERTAINLY.

05:49:06.525 --> 05:49:08.260
HAPPY TO THINK SOME MORE ABOUT

05:49:08.327 --> 05:49:10.095
THAT AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD.

05:49:10.162 --> 05:49:11.196
BUT WE'RE NOT PROPOSING TO

05:49:11.263 --> 05:49:12.331
CHANGE CURRENT PRACTICE IN TERMS

05:49:12.398 --> 05:49:14.433
OF HOW THE LAW IS CURRENTLY

05:49:14.500 --> 05:49:17.403
BEING APPLIED. BUT I UNDERSTAND

05:49:17.469 --> 05:49:18.270
THE OPPOSITION IS CONCERNED

05:49:18.337 --> 05:49:19.838
ABOUT HAVING A MORE SPECIFIC

05:49:19.905 --> 05:49:21.440
DEFINITION OF ABANDONED. IT'S

05:49:21.507 --> 05:49:22.775
CHALLENGING, AND I THINK THAT

05:49:22.841 --> 05:49:26.245
GETS TO THE UNDERLYING ISSUE OF

05:49:26.312 --> 05:49:27.279
SOMEBODY MAY BE LIVING IN IT,

05:49:27.346 --> 05:49:29.181
BUT THEY MAY STEP AWAY AND THEN

05:49:29.248 --> 05:49:30.883
IT'S ABANDONED BECAUSE NOBODY'S

05:49:30.949 --> 05:49:32.251
THERE AT THE TIME. THAT'S NOT

05:49:32.318 --> 05:49:33.786
THE INTENT OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING

05:49:33.852 --> 05:49:36.422
TO ADDRESS. AND SO AS STATED,

05:49:36.488 --> 05:49:37.389
YOU KNOW, WE'RE GOING TO

05:49:37.456 --> 05:49:38.991
CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE

05:49:39.058 --> 05:49:41.694
ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE.

05:49:41.760 --> 05:49:43.729
AND AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD

05:49:43.796 --> 05:49:46.332
IN THE ASSEMBLY. THANK YOU. AND

05:49:46.398 --> 05:49:49.301
MY LAST PART OF THIS AS WELL, IS

05:49:49.368 --> 05:49:49.968
THAT THE BILL SEEMS TO ALLOW THE

05:49:50.035 --> 05:49:51.904
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO MAKE A

05:49:51.970 --> 05:49:52.971
JUDGMENT CALL, WHICH WE'RE JUST

05:49:53.038 --> 05:49:55.407
TALKING ABOUT IN REGARDS TO THE

05:49:55.474 --> 05:49:56.842
VALUE OF THAT CAR. AND SOMETIMES

05:49:56.909 --> 05:49:58.677
IT'S JUST BASED ON HOW THE CAR

05:49:58.744 --> 05:50:00.379
EVEN LOOKS. YEAH. AND SO WHAT

05:50:00.446 --> 05:50:02.414
GUARDRAILS ARE THERE CURRENTLY

05:50:02.481 --> 05:50:04.983
OR WHAT YOU'RE CONSIDERING. SO

05:50:05.050 --> 05:50:07.619
FOR US TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS A

05:50:07.686 --> 05:50:09.054
TRULY LOW VALUE CAR THAT'S BEING

05:50:09.121 --> 05:50:10.622
TOWED. YEAH, I MEAN THAT

05:50:10.689 --> 05:50:11.924
CURRENTLY THERE'S A STATUTORY

05:50:11.990 --> 05:50:12.858
AMOUNT AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S

05:50:12.925 --> 05:50:14.827
ANOTHER BILL THAT PROPOSES TO

05:50:14.893 --> 05:50:18.364
MODIFY THAT. I RESPECTFULLY

05:50:18.430 --> 05:50:20.532
DON'T AGREE WITH THE OPPONENT'S

05:50:20.599 --> 05:50:21.633
SUGGESTION THAT THERE BE

05:50:21.700 --> 05:50:22.801
SOMEBODY WHO HAS SOME SUBJECT

05:50:22.868 --> 05:50:25.604
MATTER EXPERTISE TO APPRAISE THE

05:50:25.671 --> 05:50:27.706
VALUE OF THE. THAT'S JUST NOT A

05:50:27.773 --> 05:50:30.209
WORKABLE SOLUTION TO THE

05:50:30.275 --> 05:50:32.077
CONCERN, BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT

05:50:32.144 --> 05:50:33.212
ARE PRINCIPALLY RESPONDING TO

05:50:33.278 --> 05:50:34.747
THESE ARE CODE ENFORCEMENT

05:50:34.813 --> 05:50:36.815
OFFICERS OR PEACE OFFICERS. AND

05:50:36.882 --> 05:50:40.386
SO I THINK IT GETS TO THE

05:50:40.452 --> 05:50:43.255
UNDERLYING ISSUE OF WHAT ARE THE

05:50:43.322 --> 05:50:44.556
MARKERS OF WHETHER SOMETHING IS

05:50:44.623 --> 05:50:47.659
ABANDONED OR INOPERABLE. AND I

05:50:47.726 --> 05:50:48.494
THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE'LL

05:50:48.560 --> 05:50:49.661
CONTINUE TO THINK SOME MORE

05:50:49.728 --> 05:50:51.897
ABOUT AS THIS BILL MOVES

05:50:51.964 --> 05:50:52.798
FORWARD. AT THE END OF THE DAY,

05:50:52.865 --> 05:50:54.733
WE WANT A POLICY OR STANDARD

05:50:54.800 --> 05:50:55.934
THAT'S WORKABLE AND THAT COULD

05:50:56.001 --> 05:50:58.670
BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE FIELD. AND

05:50:58.737 --> 05:50:59.805
SO I APPRECIATE YOU RAISING THAT

05:50:59.872 --> 05:51:02.574
ISSUE. I DID NOTE THAT IN THE

05:51:02.641 --> 05:51:05.177
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS, AND I THINK

05:51:05.244 --> 05:51:06.345
THE CONVERSATIONS WE'RE HAVING

05:51:06.412 --> 05:51:10.015
WITH RESPECT TO THE DEFINITION

05:51:10.082 --> 05:51:12.684
OF ABANDONED AND HOW THAT WILL

05:51:12.751 --> 05:51:13.585
BE OPERATIONALIZED, I THINK

05:51:13.652 --> 05:51:15.287
THROUGH THAT PROCESS, WILL BE

05:51:15.354 --> 05:51:17.656
ABLE TO THINK THROUGH SOME OF

05:51:17.723 --> 05:51:18.323
THESE ISSUES. THANK YOU SO MUCH

05:51:18.390 --> 05:51:19.925
FOR THAT. THAT'S ALL I HAVE, MR.

05:51:19.992 --> 05:51:22.294
CHAIR. THANK YOU, DOCTOR

05:51:22.361 --> 05:51:22.928
COLLINS. I'M GOING TO GO NEXT TO

05:51:22.995 --> 05:51:25.497
MR. LACKEY AND THEN BACK TO YOU,

05:51:25.564 --> 05:51:26.165
MR. GONZALEZ. WELL THANK YOU. I

05:51:26.231 --> 05:51:28.801
THINK THAT THIS THIS PARTICULAR

05:51:28.867 --> 05:51:31.470
BILL PROPOSAL OUTLINES A VERY,

05:51:31.537 --> 05:51:34.339
VERY CRITICAL PIECE OF

05:51:34.406 --> 05:51:37.509
ENFORCEMENT, AND IT'S OFTEN

05:51:37.576 --> 05:51:39.778
MISINTERPRETED ACTIONS TAKEN OR

05:51:39.845 --> 05:51:43.348
OFTEN MISINTERPRETED AS LACK OF

05:51:43.415 --> 05:51:47.386
COMPASSION. AND WHEN CERTAIN

05:51:47.453 --> 05:51:49.822
CIRCUMSTANCES EXIST THAT ARE

05:51:49.888 --> 05:51:51.557
UNSAFE AND ARE THREATENING TO

05:51:51.623 --> 05:51:54.159
OTHERS, ACTION IS REQUIRED. AND

05:51:54.226 --> 05:51:56.261
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS IS.

05:51:56.328 --> 05:51:58.864
THIS IS A SITUATION THAT IS VERY

05:51:58.931 --> 05:52:00.165
UNSAFE, AND IT THREATENS THE

05:52:00.232 --> 05:52:02.501
SAFETY OF NOT ONLY THOSE WHO MAY

05:52:02.568 --> 05:52:05.704
BE UTILIZING THIS AS SHELTER,

05:52:05.771 --> 05:52:08.841
BUT OTHERS. AND SO THIS IS

05:52:08.907 --> 05:52:11.443
EASILY MISUNDERSTOOD, AS MANY

05:52:11.510 --> 05:52:13.946
ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS ARE. AND SO

05:52:14.012 --> 05:52:16.014
I COMMEND YOU FOR HAVING THE

05:52:16.081 --> 05:52:18.484
COURAGE TO TAKE ON SOMETHING

05:52:18.550 --> 05:52:20.219
VERY SENSITIVE, BUT IT'S VERY

05:52:20.285 --> 05:52:22.721
MUCH IN NEED. I THINK ANY OF US

05:52:22.788 --> 05:52:25.190
THAT HAVE BEEN IN ANY KIND OF

05:52:25.257 --> 05:52:26.692
IT'S NOT JUST URBAN CENTERS

05:52:26.758 --> 05:52:28.494
WHERE THIS IS A PROBLEM. I LIVE

05:52:28.560 --> 05:52:31.630
IN THE DESERT AND IT'S ALSO A

05:52:31.697 --> 05:52:35.200
PROBLEM THERE. AND AGAIN, IT'S

05:52:35.267 --> 05:52:37.336
OFTEN SEEN AS SOMETHING THAT'S

05:52:37.402 --> 05:52:39.171
NOT A COMPASSIONATE ACTION, WHEN

05:52:39.238 --> 05:52:42.441
IN FACT IT TRULY BRINGS AN END

05:52:42.508 --> 05:52:43.742
TO OTHER THREATS AND OTHER VERY

05:52:43.809 --> 05:52:45.277
DANGEROUS CIRCUMSTANCES. SO I

05:52:45.344 --> 05:52:47.012
COMMEND YOU AND YOU'LL HAVE MY

05:52:47.079 --> 05:52:48.013
SUPPORT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU,

05:52:48.080 --> 05:52:50.482
MR. LACKEY. MR. GONZALEZ, JUST

05:52:50.549 --> 05:52:52.184
TO ADD TO MY COLLEAGUE, I THINK

05:52:52.251 --> 05:52:52.851
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER

05:52:52.918 --> 05:52:54.453
AGAIN ON THE ABANDONED PIECE OF

05:52:54.520 --> 05:52:55.854
IT OR INOPERABLE, WHICH THE

05:52:55.921 --> 05:52:57.089
DEFINITION OF THAT IS WHERE THE

05:52:57.155 --> 05:52:57.990
VEHICLE ITSELF CANNOT MOVE

05:52:58.056 --> 05:52:59.258
WITHOUT A TOW TRUCK. AND SO

05:52:59.324 --> 05:53:01.059
WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THAT ON

05:53:01.126 --> 05:53:01.860
OUR RESPECTIVE BILLS TO MAKE

05:53:01.927 --> 05:53:04.463
SURE THAT WE DEFINE THAT PIECE.

05:53:04.530 --> 05:53:06.231
THAT'S TRUE. YEAH. YEP. THANK

05:53:06.298 --> 05:53:07.032
YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER

05:53:07.099 --> 05:53:09.434
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS, MR.

05:53:09.501 --> 05:53:10.202
CHAIR, THIS IS GONNA SOUND

05:53:10.269 --> 05:53:12.170
REALLY WEIRD. WERE YOU ON THE

05:53:12.237 --> 05:53:15.140
CITY COUNCIL IN 2012? YES. I'M

05:53:15.207 --> 05:53:16.642
PRETTY SURE I WAS YOUR

05:53:16.708 --> 05:53:17.442
CONSTITUENT FOR A SUMMER. WE'LL

05:53:17.509 --> 05:53:19.478
TALK ABOUT THAT. THEY'RE GOING

05:53:19.545 --> 05:53:21.280
TO WRITE A BOOK ABOUT YOU AND I

05:53:21.346 --> 05:53:22.781
ONE DAY. MAN. THE WEIRD, THE

05:53:22.848 --> 05:53:24.082
WEIRD CONNECTIONS THERE. BUT

05:53:24.149 --> 05:53:25.617
ANYWAY, WELL DONE. SIR, WOULD

05:53:25.684 --> 05:53:27.886
YOU LIKE TO GIVE A BRIEF CLOSE?

05:53:27.953 --> 05:53:28.921
NO. I APPRECIATE THE WORK. THE

05:53:28.987 --> 05:53:30.556
WORK OF THE COMMITTEE AND THE

05:53:30.622 --> 05:53:31.523
THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSION. THERE'S A

05:53:31.590 --> 05:53:33.125
LOT TO BALANCE HERE. IT'S A

05:53:33.191 --> 05:53:34.593
COMPLEX ISSUE. WE HAVE TO

05:53:34.660 --> 05:53:35.961
RESPECT CONSTITUTIONAL

05:53:36.028 --> 05:53:37.863
PROTECTIONS, BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO

05:53:37.930 --> 05:53:39.164
RECOGNIZE THE REALITY OF WHAT'S

05:53:39.231 --> 05:53:40.899
HAPPENING IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS

05:53:40.966 --> 05:53:41.934
CALIFORNIA, THE NEED TO BALANCE

05:53:42.000 --> 05:53:43.268
THAT WITH SUFFICIENT FLEXIBILITY

05:53:43.335 --> 05:53:45.504
TO MAKE SURE WE CAN ACT IN CASES

05:53:45.571 --> 05:53:47.205
OF SERIOUS HEALTH AND SAFETY

05:53:47.272 --> 05:53:48.407
ISSUES. AND SO THAT'S THE GOAL

05:53:48.473 --> 05:53:49.775
OF THIS BILL. IT'S NOT TO

05:53:49.841 --> 05:53:51.276
CRIMINALIZE HOMELESSNESS. IT'S

05:53:51.343 --> 05:53:52.344
ABOUT MAKING SURE WE CAN KEEP

05:53:52.411 --> 05:53:54.746
OUR COMMUNITY SAFE. I

05:53:54.813 --> 05:53:56.448
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE

05:53:56.515 --> 05:53:57.316
VOTE. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR.

05:53:57.382 --> 05:53:58.650
FOURTH DISTRICT IS THE BEST

05:53:58.717 --> 05:54:00.552
DISTRICT, AM I RIGHT? YES. OKAY.

05:54:00.619 --> 05:54:02.287
WITH THAT, CHAIR IS RECOMMENDING

COMMITTEE AND YOU'RE NOT ALREADY

THE TIME SHIFTING MODES. WE'RE

05:55:12.991 --> 05:55:15.327
TALKING TODAY ABOUT

05:55:15.394 --> 05:55:16.828
MISDEMEANANTS WHO ARE DEEMED

05:55:16.895 --> 05:55:17.896
INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL. SO

05:55:17.963 --> 05:55:19.131
SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS. WE KNOW

05:55:19.197 --> 05:55:21.166
SOME OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS

05:55:21.233 --> 05:55:22.200
HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD ON

05:55:22.267 --> 05:55:24.269
THIS ISSUE AS WELL AS YOU, MR.

05:55:24.336 --> 05:55:25.871
CHAIR, WE FEEL THAT THIS THIS

05:55:25.937 --> 05:55:26.471
LEGISLATION BEFORE YOU HERE

05:55:26.538 --> 05:55:28.440
TODAY DEALS WITH THE DISCRETE

05:55:28.507 --> 05:55:29.541
ISSUE WITHIN THE MIST ARENA

05:55:29.608 --> 05:55:31.576
AROUND MEDICATION. I PASSED A

05:55:31.643 --> 05:55:35.547
BILL IN 2021 THAT THAT GAVE MORE

05:55:35.614 --> 05:55:37.683
OPTIONS TO MISDEMEANOR

05:55:37.749 --> 05:55:39.418
DEFENDANTS TO GET SORT OF DUAL

05:55:39.484 --> 05:55:41.720
CREDIT FOR, FOR TIME SERVED,

05:55:41.787 --> 05:55:42.888
SAY, IN A DIVERSION PROGRAM

05:55:42.954 --> 05:55:44.589
VERSUS JAIL TIME. BUT

05:55:44.656 --> 05:55:45.724
INADVERTENTLY, WE ALSO REMOVE

05:55:45.791 --> 05:55:48.827
THE ABILITY FOR DOCTORS TO

05:55:48.894 --> 05:55:50.662
PRESCRIBE MEDICATION TO THE

05:55:50.729 --> 05:55:51.697
POPULATION, REGARDLESS OF THEIR

05:55:51.763 --> 05:55:53.899
MEDICAL NECESSITY, BASED ON THE

05:55:53.965 --> 05:55:55.267
SEVERITY OF THE PATIENT'S

05:55:55.333 --> 05:55:56.735
CONDITION. AND THAT TOOL HAS

05:55:56.802 --> 05:55:58.537
REALLY BEEN TAKEN OUT OF THE

05:55:58.603 --> 05:56:00.038
TOOLKIT. IF YOU COMMIT A

05:56:00.105 --> 05:56:00.639
MISDEMEANOR, THOSE THOSE TOOLS

05:56:00.706 --> 05:56:02.474
STILL EXIST FOR FOLKS WHO COMMIT

05:56:02.541 --> 05:56:03.875
FELONIES. BUT WE PUT OUR, OUR

05:56:03.942 --> 05:56:05.744
FAMILIES IN THIS THIS AWFUL

05:56:05.811 --> 05:56:07.179
SITUATION WHERE WE BASICALLY

05:56:07.245 --> 05:56:08.280
HAVE TO BE PRAYING FOR OUR SONS

05:56:08.346 --> 05:56:10.482
AND DAUGHTERS TO COMMIT A FELONY

05:56:10.549 --> 05:56:12.217
JUST SO THAT THEY CAN GET ACCESS

05:56:12.284 --> 05:56:13.952
TO MEDICATION IN THE SYSTEM. AND

05:56:14.019 --> 05:56:17.923
ONE OF OUR WITNESSES, ACTUALLY

05:56:17.989 --> 05:56:19.458
KIND OF HOOPER, WHO'S WAS

05:56:19.524 --> 05:56:21.460
SUPPOSED TO BE HERE, HOPPER

05:56:21.526 --> 05:56:26.198
SORRY, WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HERE,

05:56:26.264 --> 05:56:27.332
BUT SHE, YOU KNOW, IN HER OWN

05:56:27.399 --> 05:56:29.101
FAMILY JUST WENT THROUGH A

05:56:29.167 --> 05:56:32.003
SITUATION IN SAC COUNTY WHERE,

05:56:32.070 --> 05:56:33.705
AGAIN, HAVING A PSYCHOTIC

05:56:33.772 --> 05:56:36.742
EPISODE AND RELEASE FROM CUSTODY

05:56:36.808 --> 05:56:38.243
AND BACK ON THE STREETS AND

05:56:38.310 --> 05:56:40.679
CAN'T FIND THEM. AND IT'S

05:56:40.746 --> 05:56:41.713
AFFECTING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE,

05:56:41.780 --> 05:56:43.148
CERTAINLY IN LA COUNTY, BUT WE

05:56:43.215 --> 05:56:44.950
KNOW IT'S HITTING CLOSE TO HOME

05:56:45.016 --> 05:56:46.785
AND IN EVERYONE'S BACKYARD.

05:56:46.852 --> 05:56:48.587
WE'RE REALLY PROUD OF THE

05:56:48.653 --> 05:56:49.321
AMENDMENTS THAT THE COMMITTEE

05:56:49.387 --> 05:56:52.424
HAS WORKED WITH US ON, SO I WANT

05:56:52.491 --> 05:56:53.024
TO HEARTILY ACCEPT THOSE AND

05:56:53.091 --> 05:56:53.992
THANK THEM FOR IT. I DO THINK

05:56:54.059 --> 05:56:55.694
IT'S ACTUALLY REMOVED SOME SOME

05:56:55.761 --> 05:56:56.862
CORE OPPOSITION. WE'VE BEEN

05:56:56.928 --> 05:56:58.630
WORKING WITH A NUMBER OF

05:56:58.697 --> 05:56:59.798
STAKEHOLDERS, NOT JUST FOR THE

05:56:59.865 --> 05:57:01.867
LAST FEW MONTHS, BUT SINCE I

05:57:01.933 --> 05:57:03.034
PASSED THIS BILL IN 2021. SO

05:57:03.101 --> 05:57:05.036
IT'S BEEN A LONG, WINDING ROAD,

05:57:05.103 --> 05:57:06.538
BUT WE KNOW WE'VE GOT TO FIND A

05:57:06.605 --> 05:57:08.240
WAY TO GET FOLKS SOME

05:57:08.306 --> 05:57:08.840
PSYCHIATRIC CARE WHEN THEY'RE

05:57:08.907 --> 05:57:10.876
INCARCERATED. CARE AND LEAVING

05:57:10.942 --> 05:57:13.145
FOLKS IN THEIR CELLS TO

05:57:13.211 --> 05:57:14.880
DECOMPENSATE, AND THEN EITHER

05:57:14.946 --> 05:57:15.747
DIVERTING THEM ONTO THE STREETS

05:57:15.814 --> 05:57:17.783
OR EXPECTING THEM TO BE ABLE TO

05:57:17.849 --> 05:57:19.718
ACCEPT ANY OF THOSE ALTERNATIVE

05:57:19.785 --> 05:57:20.952
PROGRAMS IS REALLY A FOOL'S

05:57:21.019 --> 05:57:24.055
ERRAND. SO WE THINK THIS THESE

05:57:24.122 --> 05:57:25.390
AMENDMENTS STRENGTHEN THE DUE

05:57:25.457 --> 05:57:26.691
PROCESS PROTECTIONS, AND THEY

05:57:26.758 --> 05:57:28.160
CLARIFY SOME IMPORTANT COURT

05:57:28.226 --> 05:57:30.095
PROCEDURES AROUND LEAST

05:57:30.162 --> 05:57:31.429
RESTRICTIVE MEANS, AS WELL AS

05:57:31.496 --> 05:57:36.067
SOME 72 HOUR, 72 HOUR TIMELINE

05:57:36.134 --> 05:57:38.503
ON MAKING ADDITIONAL PETITIONS.

05:57:38.570 --> 05:57:40.138
AND THEY ALSO ADD A SUNSET TO

05:57:40.205 --> 05:57:42.307
THE MEASURE HERE WITH ME TODAY

05:57:42.374 --> 05:57:43.475

PHYSICIAN AND ADDICTION

05:58:25.116 --> 05:58:25.784
SPECIALIST WHO HAS BEEN WORKING

05:58:25.851 --> 05:58:27.285
WITH THE UNHOUSED POPULATION FOR

05:58:27.352 --> 05:58:28.920
OVER 20 YEARS. I'M ALSO THE

05:58:28.987 --> 05:58:30.622
DIRECTOR OF THE GRAVE OF THE

05:58:30.689 --> 05:58:31.456
CALIFORNIA'S GRAVE DISABILITY

05:58:31.523 --> 05:58:33.825
WORK GROUP. I HELPED CREATE THE

05:58:33.892 --> 05:58:35.627
FIRST STREET MEDICINE TEAM IN

05:58:35.694 --> 05:58:37.028
LOS ANGELES COUNTY, AND THE

05:58:37.095 --> 05:58:38.263
FIRST STREET MEDICINE TEAM ON

05:58:38.330 --> 05:58:40.632
SKID ROW. I HAVE NOW FOCUSED THE

05:58:40.699 --> 05:58:42.167
LAST TEN YEARS WORKING WITH THE

05:58:42.234 --> 05:58:43.535
SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL COMMUNITY

05:58:43.602 --> 05:58:45.937
IN THE STREETS AND IN THE JAILS.

05:58:46.004 --> 05:58:48.206
I WORKED THE WOMEN'S JAIL IN LA

05:58:48.273 --> 05:58:49.674
COUNTY AND WAS THE LIAISON

05:58:49.741 --> 05:58:50.942
DOCTOR FOR THE HIGH OBSERVATION

05:58:51.009 --> 05:58:53.245
HOUSING POPULATION. BECAUSE THE

05:58:53.311 --> 05:58:55.680
WOMEN'S JAIL WAS NOT LPS

05:58:55.747 --> 05:58:57.415
DESIGNATED, WE WERE NOT ALLOWED

05:58:57.482 --> 05:58:59.951
TO MEDICATE PEOPLE UNWILLINGLY.

05:59:00.018 --> 05:59:03.388
I SAW PEOPLE DAY IN AND DAY OUT,

05:59:03.455 --> 05:59:05.023
LITERALLY ON DEATH'S DOOR

05:59:05.090 --> 05:59:06.791
BECAUSE THEY WERE. THERE WAS A

05:59:06.858 --> 05:59:08.627
TWO WEEK WAIT FOR THE INPATIENT

05:59:08.693 --> 05:59:10.095
HOSPITAL. I SAW ONE WOMAN WHO

05:59:10.161 --> 05:59:12.564
WAS EATING HER OWN FECES. I SAW

05:59:12.631 --> 05:59:14.032
ONE WOMAN NAKED SMEARING FECES

05:59:14.099 --> 05:59:16.201
ON THE WALLS, THE WINDOW, AND

05:59:16.268 --> 05:59:17.969
SPEAKING TO HERSELF.

05:59:18.036 --> 05:59:19.437
NONSENSICALLY. I SAW ONE WOMAN,

05:59:19.504 --> 05:59:21.406
NAKED AND CATATONIC, WHO STOPPED

05:59:21.473 --> 05:59:22.674
EATING AND DRINKING, AND BY THE

05:59:22.741 --> 05:59:25.243
TIME I GOT THERE, SHE REQUIRED

05:59:25.310 --> 05:59:26.645
HOSPITALIZATION FOR SEVERE

05:59:26.711 --> 05:59:28.613
DEHYDRATION. THESE ARE PEOPLE

05:59:28.680 --> 05:59:30.215
THAT WE COULDN'T MEDICATE

05:59:30.282 --> 05:59:31.716
BECAUSE IT WAS UNLAWFUL, AND

05:59:31.783 --> 05:59:33.318
THEY WERE SEVERELY DETERIORATING

05:59:33.385 --> 05:59:35.220
BOTH MENTALLY AND MEDICALLY. THE

05:59:35.287 --> 05:59:37.155
PHYSICIANS IN JAIL ARE TRYING TO

05:59:37.222 --> 05:59:39.357
SAVE LIVES. WE'RE NOT TRYING TO

05:59:39.424 --> 05:59:41.526
WILLY NILLY SNOW INMATES JUST TO

05:59:41.593 --> 05:59:43.261
MAKE THEM MORE MANAGEABLE. IF

05:59:43.328 --> 05:59:45.163
YOU LOOK AT THOSE WHO ARE DYING

05:59:45.230 --> 05:59:47.565
IN JAILS, THERE WERE 32 IN LA

05:59:47.632 --> 05:59:49.567
COUNTY LAST YEAR WHEN WE MET

05:59:49.634 --> 05:59:51.870
WITH SHERIFF LUNA LAST YEAR AND

05:59:51.937 --> 05:59:53.872
ASKED HIM WHAT THE CAUSES WERE,

05:59:53.939 --> 05:59:54.706
HE CONFIRMED THAT THEY WERE

05:59:54.773 --> 05:59:56.007
ALMOST ALL SEVERELY MENTALLY

05:59:56.074 --> 05:59:57.876
ILL. PEOPLE. LET US TREAT OUR

05:59:57.943 --> 05:59:59.711
PATIENTS THE WAY WE ARE TRAINED

05:59:59.778 --> 06:00:01.212
TO TREAT THEM. IF SOMEONE IS

06:00:01.279 --> 06:00:02.647
HAVING DIFFICULTY BREATHING, I

06:00:02.714 --> 06:00:04.049
DON'T ASK THEM, DO YOU AGREE TO

06:00:04.115 --> 06:00:06.284
LIFE SAVING TREATMENT? IT'S AN

06:00:06.351 --> 06:00:07.686
EMERGENCY. I JUST TREAT THEM

06:00:07.752 --> 06:00:09.087
SIMILARLY. IF SOMEONE'S

06:00:09.154 --> 06:00:10.555
PSYCHOTIC, IT'S AN EMERGENCY AND

06:00:10.622 --> 06:00:12.324
WE NEED TO TREAT THEM

06:00:12.390 --> 06:00:14.159
EMERGENTLY. IT'S CRUEL TO ALLOW

06:00:14.225 --> 06:00:15.927
ANYONE TO LINGER IN THEIR

06:00:15.994 --> 06:00:17.529
PSYCHOSIS, ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE

06:00:17.595 --> 06:00:20.332
ARE CLINICIANS AVAILABLE TO

06:00:20.398 --> 06:00:22.834
TREAT THEM. THESE PEOPLE ARE

06:00:22.901 --> 06:00:24.602
SUFFERING FROM SEVERE PSYCHOSIS.

06:00:24.669 --> 06:00:26.004
THEY'RE IN PAIN, AND IT'S THE

06:00:26.071 --> 06:00:29.374
ONLY ETHICAL THING TO DO TO

06:00:29.441 --> 06:00:30.875
ALLOW US TO TREAT THEM. THANK

06:00:30.942 --> 06:00:34.346
YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON, CHAIR

06:00:34.412 --> 06:00:35.647
SCHULTZ, MEMBERS OF THE

06:00:35.714 --> 06:00:36.815
COMMITTEE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH

06:00:36.881 --> 06:00:38.550
FOR YOUR WORK IN THIS IMPORTANT

06:00:38.616 --> 06:00:39.884
BILL. I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF

06:00:39.951 --> 06:00:41.119
OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE

06:00:41.186 --> 06:00:42.287
ASSOCIATION OF PSYCHIATRISTS,

06:00:42.354 --> 06:00:44.756
PROUD SPONSOR OF SENATE BILL

06:00:44.823 --> 06:00:46.591
820. SO, MOST IMPORTANTLY, THIS

06:00:46.658 --> 06:00:48.259
BILL TREATS PEOPLE WHO ARE

06:00:48.326 --> 06:00:49.761
INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL

06:00:49.828 --> 06:00:50.929
EQUALLY, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER

06:00:50.996 --> 06:00:53.064
THEY COMMITTED A FELONY OR A

06:00:53.131 --> 06:00:54.399
MISDEMEANOR. CURRENTLY,

06:00:54.466 --> 06:00:56.234
INVOLUNTARY MEDICATION ORDER CAN

06:00:56.301 --> 06:00:58.136
ONLY BE ISSUED AT THE SAME TIME

06:00:58.203 --> 06:00:59.571
AS A FELONY INCOMPETENCY

06:00:59.637 --> 06:01:01.706
PROCEEDING THE SAME IS NOT TRUE

06:01:01.773 --> 06:01:02.841
FOR MISDEMEANORS. UNTREATED

06:01:02.907 --> 06:01:05.010
MENTAL ILLNESS DOES LEAD TO

06:01:05.076 --> 06:01:06.344
DETERIORATION IN CARCERAL

06:01:06.411 --> 06:01:08.179
SETTINGS, REGARDLESS OF CRIME,

06:01:08.246 --> 06:01:09.581
SO THE AMENDMENTS IN 820 ARE

06:01:09.647 --> 06:01:11.416
VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE, AS

06:01:11.483 --> 06:01:12.784
SENATOR STERN SAID, THEY

06:01:12.851 --> 06:01:13.885
STRENGTHEN DUE PROCESS

06:01:13.952 --> 06:01:15.020
PROTECTIONS AND CLARIFY THE

06:01:15.086 --> 06:01:16.921
NECESSARY COURT FINDINGS. SO NOT

06:01:16.988 --> 06:01:18.323
ONLY MUST THE PERSON HAVE A

06:01:18.390 --> 06:01:20.325
MENTAL ILLNESS AND BE GRAVELY

06:01:20.392 --> 06:01:22.594
DISABLED, THEY ALSO HAVE TO LACK

06:01:22.660 --> 06:01:24.396
CAPACITY TO CONSENT OR REFUSE

06:01:24.462 --> 06:01:26.164
ANTIPSYCHOTIC MEDICATION. WE

06:01:26.231 --> 06:01:27.632
HAVE TO STIPULATE ALSO THAT

06:01:27.699 --> 06:01:29.734
SERIOUS HARM IS LIKELY TO OCCUR,

06:01:29.801 --> 06:01:31.302
AND THERE MUST BE NO VIABLE

06:01:31.369 --> 06:01:32.804
ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS

06:01:32.871 --> 06:01:34.873
AND NO AVAILABLE COMMUNITY BASED

06:01:34.939 --> 06:01:36.541
ALTERNATIVES. SO THIS

06:01:36.608 --> 06:01:37.809
INTERVENTION IS RESERVED FOR

06:01:37.876 --> 06:01:39.644
INDIVIDUALS WITH THE MOST SEVERE

06:01:39.711 --> 06:01:41.046
MENTAL ILLNESS WHO NEED HELP THE

06:01:41.112 --> 06:01:42.747
MOST, BUT DEMONSTRATE THE LEAST

06:01:42.814 --> 06:01:44.282
INSIGHT. AND I'VE PREVIOUSLY

06:01:44.349 --> 06:01:45.984
WORKED IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY

06:01:46.051 --> 06:01:47.819
JAILS. THERE ARE INCREDIBLY

06:01:47.886 --> 06:01:48.787
VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS WITH

06:01:48.853 --> 06:01:51.289
SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS, OFTEN IN

06:01:51.356 --> 06:01:52.991
SOLITARY CONFINEMENT. PEOPLE WHO

06:01:53.058 --> 06:01:54.959
HAVE LOST SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF

06:01:55.026 --> 06:01:57.162
WEIGHT DUE TO REFUSAL TO EAT.

06:01:57.228 --> 06:01:57.762
THEY'RE UNCLOTHED, AS DOCTOR

06:01:57.829 --> 06:01:58.997
TOVEY SAID, COVERED IN FECES,

06:01:59.064 --> 06:02:00.665
LIVING IN A FLOODED CELL WITH

06:02:00.732 --> 06:02:02.600
TRASH AND FOOD CLOGGING THEIR

06:02:02.667 --> 06:02:03.902
TOILET. THERE ARE SOME WHO

06:02:03.968 --> 06:02:05.370
WOULDN'T PRESENT FOR EVALUATION

06:02:05.437 --> 06:02:07.539
YELLING THINGS AT ME THAT DIDN'T

06:02:07.605 --> 06:02:08.440
MAKE SENSE. THEIR PROCEEDINGS

06:02:08.506 --> 06:02:10.742
WERE SUSPENDED FOR MONTHS. IN

06:02:10.809 --> 06:02:12.310
THE OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF

06:02:12.377 --> 06:02:13.244
CIRCUMSTANCES, THERE IS LITTLE

06:02:13.311 --> 06:02:15.146
HOPE THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN

06:02:15.213 --> 06:02:16.848
IMPROVE WITHOUT ANTIPSYCHOTIC

06:02:16.915 --> 06:02:18.783
MEDICATIONS. SO THIS BILL GIVES

06:02:18.850 --> 06:02:19.918
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE GRAVELY

06:02:19.984 --> 06:02:20.852
DISABLED AND INCOMPETENT TO

06:02:20.919 --> 06:02:23.455
STAND TRIAL A CHANCE AT

06:02:23.521 --> 06:02:24.923
STABILIZATION PRIOR TO RELEASE,

06:02:24.989 --> 06:02:27.258
A CHANCE TO NOT ONLY AVOID

06:02:27.325 --> 06:02:28.159
FURTHER INCARCERATION, BUT ALSO

06:02:28.226 --> 06:02:30.328
A RESTRICTIVE CONSERVATORSHIP.

06:02:30.395 --> 06:02:32.597
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELL, THANK

06:02:32.664 --> 06:02:33.398
YOU, SENATOR, FOR THE

06:02:33.465 --> 06:02:35.300
PRESENTATION, AND THANK YOU BOTH

FOR YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY. NEXT,

06:02:36.401 --> 06:02:38.303
WE'LL TAKE ANY OTHER METOOS

06:02:38.369 --> 06:02:40.338
WOULD ANYONE LIKE TO BE HEARD IN

06:02:40.405 --> 06:02:41.606
SUPPORT OF THE BILL? PERFECT.

06:02:41.673 --> 06:02:43.942
TAKE YOUR TIME. MAKE YOUR WAY

06:02:44.008 --> 06:02:45.143
OVER TO THE MICROPHONE ON THIS

06:02:45.210 --> 06:02:46.244
SIDE. NAME, ORGANIZATION AND

06:02:46.311 --> 06:02:47.946
YOUR POSITION, PLEASE. THANK

06:02:48.012 --> 06:02:49.114
YOU. CLAIRE SULLIVAN, ON BEHALF

06:02:49.180 --> 06:02:51.382
OF THE CITY OF BAKERSFIELD AND

STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU.

06:03:00.325 --> 06:03:01.593
FAMILIES ADVOCATING FOR THE

06:03:01.659 --> 06:03:03.361
SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL, MENTALLY

06:03:03.428 --> 06:03:06.598
ILL AND SUPPORT. WONDERFUL.

06:03:06.664 --> 06:03:08.032
THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH. DO WE

06:03:08.099 --> 06:03:09.901
HAVE ANYONE HERE HOPING TO

06:03:09.968 --> 06:03:12.437
TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION? OKAY. WE

06:03:12.504 --> 06:03:14.539
DO? YES. COME ON DOWN. YOU

06:03:14.606 --> 06:03:16.107
GENTLEMEN CAN TAKE THESE SEATS

06:03:16.174 --> 06:03:17.408
RIGHT HERE. ONCE YOU START

06:03:17.475 --> 06:03:18.743
SPEAKING, YOU'LL HAVE A COMBINED

06:03:18.810 --> 06:03:21.813
TOTAL TIME OF FIVE MINUTES TO

06:03:21.880 --> 06:03:31.089
ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE. 32 DAYS.

06:03:31.156 --> 06:03:33.258
YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON, CHAIR AND

06:03:33.324 --> 06:03:34.759
MEMBERS. I'M MARCO RAMOS WITH

06:03:34.826 --> 06:03:36.928
CAMP FOR A STATEWIDE NETWORK OF

06:03:36.995 --> 06:03:38.830
PEER RUN MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS.

06:03:38.897 --> 06:03:42.066
WE STILL OPPOSE SB 820 FOR FOUR

06:03:42.133 --> 06:03:44.569
MAIN REASONS. NUMBER ONE, BIGGER

06:03:44.636 --> 06:03:46.437
REACH FOR FORCE MEDS. THE BILL

06:03:46.504 --> 06:03:48.072
LETS COUNTY JAILS START

06:03:48.139 --> 06:03:49.507
SATURATING PSYCHIATRIC

06:03:49.574 --> 06:03:50.875
MEDICATION ON PEOPLE FOUND

06:03:50.942 --> 06:03:52.777
INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL FOR

06:03:52.844 --> 06:03:53.912
MISDEMEANORS, AND THAT EXPANDS

06:03:53.978 --> 06:03:55.246
THE PRACTICE THAT ALREADY HURTS

06:03:55.313 --> 06:03:57.782
MANY PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY.

06:03:57.849 --> 06:04:00.285
THE NUMBER TWO LIGHT DUE PROCESS

06:04:00.351 --> 06:04:02.187
RULES THE BILL LETS JAIL SAY,

06:04:02.253 --> 06:04:04.155
HEY, WE TRIED TO FIND A HOSPITAL

06:04:04.222 --> 06:04:06.024
BED, CHECK A BOX, AND THEN GO

06:04:06.090 --> 06:04:07.625
AHEAD WITH FORCED MEDICATION

06:04:07.692 --> 06:04:09.327
RIGHT THERE IN THE JAIL, ONE

06:04:09.394 --> 06:04:11.462
LINE OF PAPERWORK IS TREATED AS

06:04:11.529 --> 06:04:13.331
DUE PROCESS, EVEN THOUGH THE

06:04:13.398 --> 06:04:14.699
PERSON NEVER LEAVES CUSTODY OR

06:04:14.766 --> 06:04:16.634
SEES AN OUTSIDE DOCTOR. THAT IS

06:04:16.701 --> 06:04:19.103
NOT REAL DIVERSION OR REAL

06:04:19.170 --> 06:04:21.806
CHOICE. NUMBER THREE WE WRONG

06:04:21.873 --> 06:04:24.342
PLACE WEAK MONITORING. PICTURE

06:04:24.409 --> 06:04:26.611
THIS. SOMEONE IS HANDED A

06:04:26.678 --> 06:04:28.379
POWERFUL ANTIPSYCHOTIC WHILE

06:04:28.446 --> 06:04:30.915
STILL IN GENERAL. CELL BLOCK A

06:04:30.982 --> 06:04:33.384
NURSE PEEKS IN FOUR TIMES OVER

06:04:33.451 --> 06:04:34.552
THE FIRST HOUR, THEN WALKS AWAY.

06:04:34.619 --> 06:04:37.722
THE REAL DANGER OFTEN HITS HOURS

06:04:37.789 --> 06:04:40.191
OR EVEN DAYS LATER. BY THEN, A

06:04:40.258 --> 06:04:42.460
GUARD, NOT EVEN A CLINICIAN, IS

06:04:42.527 --> 06:04:44.229
WHO DECIDES WHETHER THE PERSON

06:04:44.295 --> 06:04:46.331
IS ACTING OUT OR SUFFERING A

06:04:46.397 --> 06:04:49.200
MEDICAL CRISIS. THAT GAP PUTS

06:04:49.267 --> 06:04:50.768
LIVES IN EVERYONE IN THAT UNIT

06:04:50.835 --> 06:04:53.605
AT RISK. NUMBER FOUR KEEPS

06:04:53.671 --> 06:04:55.707
PEOPLE IN JAIL AND NOT IN CARE.

06:04:55.773 --> 06:04:57.508
BY CREATING A JAIL BASED

06:04:57.575 --> 06:05:00.311
PATHWAY. SB 820 NUDGES COUNTIES

06:05:00.378 --> 06:05:02.580
TO HOLD PEOPLE LONGER INSTEAD OF

06:05:02.647 --> 06:05:04.082
FINDING COMMUNITY BEDS. IT ADDS

06:05:04.148 --> 06:05:06.985
MONEY FOR COURT STEPS, NONE FOR

06:05:07.051 --> 06:05:09.354
HOUSING, PEER RESPITE OR REAL

06:05:09.420 --> 06:05:10.855
TREATMENT UNTIL THE BILL

06:05:10.922 --> 06:05:12.190
REQUIRES A LICENSED MEDICAL

06:05:12.257 --> 06:05:13.658
UNIT, LONGER MONITORING OR A

06:05:13.725 --> 06:05:16.160
TRUE MOVE TO COMMUNITY CARE.

06:05:16.227 --> 06:05:20.231
FIRST, IT IS UNSAFE AND UNFAIR.

06:05:20.298 --> 06:05:22.000
PLEASE VOTE NO ON SB 820. THANK

06:05:22.066 --> 06:05:29.040
YOU. THANK YOU, CHAIR AND

06:05:29.107 --> 06:05:30.508
MEMBERS SAMUEL CHEN WITH

06:05:30.575 --> 06:05:32.210
DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. WE

06:05:32.277 --> 06:05:34.045
THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THE

06:05:34.112 --> 06:05:36.314
PROGRESS MADE ON THIS BILL. THE

06:05:36.381 --> 06:05:36.981
RECENT AMENDMENTS ADDRESSED

06:05:37.048 --> 06:05:38.483
SEVERAL OF OUR CONCERNS, BUT WE

06:05:38.549 --> 06:05:39.817
HAVE REMAINING CONCERNS AND ARE

06:05:39.884 --> 06:05:42.687
HERE IN OPPOSITION TO SB 820. I

06:05:42.754 --> 06:05:44.122
WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE

06:05:44.188 --> 06:05:46.658
COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TO PENAL

06:05:46.724 --> 06:05:51.396
CODE 26 03.5 A ON THE BOTTOM OF

06:05:51.462 --> 06:05:54.265
PAGE TWO OF THE MOCK UP OF THE

06:05:54.332 --> 06:05:55.300
ANALYSIS, WE'RE CONCERNED THAT

06:05:55.366 --> 06:05:57.201
THOSE CONFLICT WITH OTHER

06:05:57.268 --> 06:05:58.469
PROVISIONS IN THE BILL AND

06:05:58.536 --> 06:06:01.039
SUBSECTION C, WE'RE CONCERNED

06:06:01.105 --> 06:06:03.241
THAT THIS CHANGE READS THAT THE

06:06:03.308 --> 06:06:05.243
REQUIREMENTS UNDER SUBSECTION C

06:06:05.310 --> 06:06:08.746
MUST ONLY BE CONSIDERED. THIS

06:06:08.813 --> 06:06:10.581
BILL WOULD CREATE A NEW

06:06:10.648 --> 06:06:11.883
MECHANISM FOR ADMINISTERING

06:06:11.949 --> 06:06:14.085
INVOLUNTARY MEDICATION ORDERS

06:06:14.152 --> 06:06:15.019
FOR INDIVIDUALS FACING

06:06:15.086 --> 06:06:16.220
MISDEMEANOR CHARGES AND

06:06:16.287 --> 06:06:17.555
DETERMINED INCOMPETENT TO STAND

06:06:17.622 --> 06:06:20.458
TRIAL. THE BILL WOULD EXPAND THE

06:06:20.525 --> 06:06:21.993
ABILITY OF COUNTY JAILS TO

06:06:22.060 --> 06:06:24.162
FORCIBLY ADMINISTER POWERFUL

06:06:24.228 --> 06:06:26.030
PSYCHIATRIC MEDICATIONS IN

06:06:26.097 --> 06:06:27.365
NON-CLINICAL SETTINGS LIKE

06:06:27.432 --> 06:06:29.267
GENERAL POPULATION. I'VE HAD

06:06:29.334 --> 06:06:31.069
MANY CLIENTS WHO ARE SUBJECT TO

06:06:31.135 --> 06:06:33.104
FORCED MEDICATION. OFTEN THEY'RE

06:06:33.171 --> 06:06:35.206
HELD DOWN BY 5 OR 6 STAFF

06:06:35.273 --> 06:06:36.174
MEMBERS. THEY'RE FLIPPED OVER

06:06:36.240 --> 06:06:38.276
ONTO THEIR STOMACHS, THEIR PANTS

06:06:38.343 --> 06:06:40.078
ARE PULLED DOWN, AND THEY'RE

06:06:40.144 --> 06:06:41.079
INJECTED IN THEIR GLUTE WITH

06:06:41.145 --> 06:06:42.814
POWERFUL SEDATIVES LIKE HALDOL

06:06:42.880 --> 06:06:45.583
OR THORAZINE. THE EFFECTS OF

06:06:45.650 --> 06:06:47.218
THESE MEDICATIONS ARE OFTEN SO

06:06:47.285 --> 06:06:48.986
PRONOUNCED, THE INDIVIDUAL FALLS

06:06:49.053 --> 06:06:50.321
ASLEEP AND IS VERY DIFFICULT TO

06:06:50.388 --> 06:06:52.890
WAKE UP. IT'S COMMON FOR PEOPLE

06:06:52.957 --> 06:06:54.392
TO URINATE THEMSELVES AFTER

06:06:54.459 --> 06:06:55.860
RECEIVING THESE INJECTIONS,

06:06:55.927 --> 06:06:57.195
BECAUSE THEY'RE SO STRONG THAT

06:06:57.261 --> 06:06:59.163
THE INDIVIDUAL IS UNABLE TO

06:06:59.230 --> 06:07:01.532
RESPOND TO BASIC BODILY NEEDS. I

06:07:01.599 --> 06:07:04.502
HAVE CLIENTS WHO SHARE, YEARS

06:07:04.569 --> 06:07:06.304
LATER, AFTER BEING HELD DOWN AND

06:07:06.371 --> 06:07:08.206
FORCIBLY MEDICATED, THAT THAT

06:07:08.272 --> 06:07:09.874
WAS THE WORST MOMENT OF THEIR

06:07:09.941 --> 06:07:12.410
LIFE. IN JAIL SETTINGS, THESE

06:07:12.477 --> 06:07:13.444
INTERVENTIONS CAN BE

06:07:13.511 --> 06:07:16.047
PARTICULARLY VIOLENT FOR THESE

06:07:16.114 --> 06:07:17.181
INTERVENTIONS TO BE CONDUCTED IN

06:07:17.248 --> 06:07:19.117
A GENERAL POPULATION UNIT, AND

06:07:19.183 --> 06:07:20.752
THE INDIVIDUAL TO THEN BE LEFT

06:07:20.818 --> 06:07:22.887
IN THAT UNIT AND RECEIVE MINIMAL

06:07:22.954 --> 06:07:24.222
MONITORING AND SUPERVISION BY

06:07:24.288 --> 06:07:26.124
HEALTH STAFF. JUST ONE HOUR

06:07:26.190 --> 06:07:27.959
UNDER THIS BILL IS

06:07:28.025 --> 06:07:29.660
UNCONSCIONABLE. WE ASK FOR YOUR

06:07:29.727 --> 06:07:31.129
OPPOSITION TO SB 820 FOR THESE

06:07:31.195 --> 06:07:32.330
REASONS. THANK YOU. AND I

06:07:32.397 --> 06:07:33.564
BELIEVE WE HAD ONE OTHER

06:07:33.631 --> 06:07:35.500
INDIVIDUAL WHO WANTED TO LAUGH.

06:07:35.566 --> 06:07:38.002
MAY I TAKE IT I APOLOGIZE? UNDER

06:07:38.069 --> 06:07:39.804
COMMITTEE RULES, WE ONLY HAVE

06:07:39.871 --> 06:07:41.572
TWO WITNESSES. BUT IF YOU WANT

06:07:41.639 --> 06:07:42.874
TO USE ANY REMAINING TIME, YOU

06:07:42.940 --> 06:07:44.876
CAN, AND HE WILL HAVE A CHANCE

06:07:44.942 --> 06:07:45.943
TO REGISTER HIS OPPOSITION IN A

06:07:46.010 --> 06:07:47.845
MOMENT. THANK YOU. MY NAME IS

MEANING. I'M SORRY, SIR, HE CAN

06:07:56.320 --> 06:07:58.423
USE THE MINUTE. I WILL LET YOU

SAY WHO YOU'RE WITH IN YOUR

06:08:00.758 --> 06:08:01.726
POSITION. ANYTHING ELSE EITHER

06:08:01.793 --> 06:08:03.995
OF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD? I

06:08:04.061 --> 06:08:05.263
DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE RIGHT

06:08:05.329 --> 06:08:07.198
NOW. NO. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. THANK

06:08:07.265 --> 06:08:08.833
YOU BOTH VERY MUCH. SORRY FOR

06:08:08.900 --> 06:08:10.134
THE CONFUSION. JUST WANT TO KEEP

06:08:10.201 --> 06:08:12.270
THE COMMITTEE RULES ALIVE AND

06:08:12.336 --> 06:08:13.938
WELL. WE'LL NOW DO THE. ME TOO.

06:08:14.005 --> 06:08:15.807
SO WE'LL START WITH YOU, SIR.

06:08:15.873 --> 06:08:17.008
ANYONE ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO BE

06:08:17.074 --> 06:08:18.342
HEARD IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL?

06:08:18.409 --> 06:08:20.344
PLEASE COME FORWARD AT THIS TIME

06:08:20.411 --> 06:08:20.978
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. SIR. MY

06:08:21.045 --> 06:08:22.046

06:09:04.055 --> 06:09:05.156
NOW WE'LL TURN IT OVER TO THE

06:09:05.223 --> 06:09:06.691
COMMITTEE. ARE THERE ANY

06:09:06.757 --> 06:09:07.458
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM

06:09:07.525 --> 06:09:08.359
COMMITTEE MEMBERS ABOUT THE

06:09:08.426 --> 06:09:10.428
BILL? I JUST WANT TO THANK THE

06:09:10.495 --> 06:09:12.597
AUTHOR FOR THIS. I KNOW I WORKED

06:09:12.663 --> 06:09:13.731
IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES,

06:09:13.798 --> 06:09:15.833
REPRESENT PART OF THE AREA, NO

06:09:15.900 --> 06:09:17.235
LONGER HAVE SKID ROW, BUT THE

06:09:17.301 --> 06:09:18.202
ISSUE THAT THIS HOUSE HAS DONE

06:09:18.269 --> 06:09:20.738
AND THIS BODY HAS DONE TO WORK

06:09:20.805 --> 06:09:22.139
WITH CARE COURTS, PREVENTING

06:09:22.206 --> 06:09:22.673
CONSERVATORSHIPS AND OTHER

06:09:22.740 --> 06:09:24.108
PIECES THAT I HAVE A STREET

06:09:24.175 --> 06:09:25.643
MEDICINE BILL MYSELF. SO I

06:09:25.710 --> 06:09:27.245
APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON THAT.

06:09:27.311 --> 06:09:27.879
AND OBVIOUSLY THE CONVERSATION

06:09:27.945 --> 06:09:29.547
OF GRAVELY DISABLED. KEEP IN

06:09:29.614 --> 06:09:31.015
MIND, THOUGH, THAT ALL OF THOSE

06:09:31.082 --> 06:09:31.816
EFFORTS HAVE BEEN PREVENTABLE

06:09:31.883 --> 06:09:33.184
AND THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO HELP

06:09:33.251 --> 06:09:35.086
WITH TREATMENT AND HOUSING AND

06:09:35.152 --> 06:09:36.787
SO FORTH. BUT THIS IS FOR

06:09:36.854 --> 06:09:37.388
INMATES WHO'VE ALREADY PASSED

06:09:37.455 --> 06:09:39.190
THIS PART OF IT. SO I THINK THIS

06:09:39.257 --> 06:09:41.192
IS ABSOLUTELY NEEDED TO GET THEM

06:09:41.259 --> 06:09:42.860
OUT. AND SO I THINK I WANT TO

06:09:42.927 --> 06:09:44.161
JUST THANK THE AUTHOR FOR

06:09:44.228 --> 06:09:45.863
PUTTING THAT TOGETHER. I KNOW

06:09:45.930 --> 06:09:46.597
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT AS

06:09:46.664 --> 06:09:48.165
WELL WITH THE AUTHOR. SO I

06:09:48.232 --> 06:09:50.468
APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR TIME ON

06:09:50.535 --> 06:09:50.968
THAT. IS THAT A MOTION?

06:09:51.035 --> 06:09:51.569
ASSEMBLYMEMBER GONZALEZ OKAY.

06:09:51.636 --> 06:09:53.771
AND WE HAVE A SECOND BY DOCTOR

06:09:53.838 --> 06:09:54.705
SHARPE COLLINS AND A THIRD BY

06:09:54.772 --> 06:09:56.674
MISS NGUYEN. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS

06:09:56.741 --> 06:09:58.776
OR COMMENTS? MR. LACKEY? YEAH,

06:09:58.843 --> 06:10:00.945
JUST REAL QUICKLY. ANOTHER

06:10:01.012 --> 06:10:05.416
EXAMPLE OF MISPLACED ASSERTION

06:10:05.483 --> 06:10:07.752
THAT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS ARE NOT

06:10:07.818 --> 06:10:10.254
COMPASSIONATE. THIS IS A VERY

06:10:10.321 --> 06:10:11.389
DELICATE CIRCUMSTANCE. WHEN YOU

06:10:11.455 --> 06:10:13.124
HAVE SOMEBODY THAT'S IN THIS

06:10:13.190 --> 06:10:15.359
CONDITION, THERE'S NO PRETTY WAY

06:10:15.426 --> 06:10:19.931
TO MANAGE IT. IT'S JUST AS THE

06:10:19.997 --> 06:10:22.433
OPPOSITION INDICATED, THE

06:10:22.500 --> 06:10:25.403
AWKWARD NATURE OF ACTION.

06:10:25.469 --> 06:10:26.404
SOMETIMES IT'S MISUNDERSTOOD AND

06:10:26.470 --> 06:10:30.408
IT'S UNFORTUNATE. BUT IN ORDER

06:10:30.474 --> 06:10:32.577
TO MITIGATE CIRCUMSTANCES,

06:10:32.643 --> 06:10:35.446
THERE'S NO PRETTY WAY. AND SO

06:10:35.513 --> 06:10:36.747
THIS IS MORE COMPASSIONATE, IN

06:10:36.814 --> 06:10:39.717
MY OPINION, TO BRING AN END TO

06:10:39.784 --> 06:10:41.919
DYSFUNCTION. THAT'S REALLY HARD

06:10:41.986 --> 06:10:44.255
TO UNDERSTAND. AND I APPRECIATE

06:10:44.322 --> 06:10:45.756
YOU HAVING THE COURAGE TO BRING

06:10:45.823 --> 06:10:46.691
IT FORWARD. AND I'LL BE

06:10:46.757 --> 06:10:48.559
SUPPORTING YOU. THANK YOU. THANK

06:10:48.626 --> 06:10:50.127
YOU, MR. LACKEY. ANY OTHER

06:10:50.194 --> 06:10:52.863
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS? ALL

06:10:52.930 --> 06:10:54.565
RIGHT. SENATOR STERN, YOUR

06:10:54.632 --> 06:10:55.800
CHANCE TO CLOSE. I WAS GOING TO

06:10:55.866 --> 06:10:58.002
ASK YOU IF YOU HAD ANY RESPONSE

06:10:58.069 --> 06:10:59.070
TO THE CONCERNS THAT WERE

06:10:59.136 --> 06:11:01.172
RAISED. IF YOU WANT TO DEAL WITH

06:11:01.238 --> 06:11:02.707
THAT IN YOUR CLOSING, THAT'D BE

06:11:02.773 --> 06:11:04.075
GREAT. YEAH. THANK YOU FOR THAT

06:11:04.141 --> 06:11:05.810
OPPORTUNITY, MR. CHAIR. I WAS I

06:11:05.876 --> 06:11:06.877
WAS PLANNING TO DO THAT. AND TO

06:11:06.944 --> 06:11:09.246
BE CLEAR ON BOTH THE COMMITTEE

06:11:09.313 --> 06:11:09.847
AMENDMENTS AND THE UNDERLYING

06:11:09.914 --> 06:11:10.982
BILL, WE DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS

06:11:11.048 --> 06:11:13.084
JUST A CHECK THE BOX EXERCISE

06:11:13.150 --> 06:11:14.619
THAT CAN BE THAT THERE WILL BE

06:11:14.685 --> 06:11:15.186
JUDICIAL DISCRETION ON THIS,

06:11:15.252 --> 06:11:18.055
THAT THIS WILL BE A MATTER FOR

06:11:18.122 --> 06:11:20.124
NOT JUST TO HAPPEN IN COURT, I

06:11:20.191 --> 06:11:21.926
MEAN, TO HAPPEN IN THE JAIL, BUT

06:11:21.993 --> 06:11:22.927
THAT THE COURT ITSELF AND THE

06:11:22.994 --> 06:11:25.162
JUDGE WILL HAVE THAT SORT OF DUE

06:11:25.229 --> 06:11:26.731
PROCESS POWER OVER THESE NEW

06:11:26.797 --> 06:11:28.399
SUBSTANTIAL RIGHTS THAT ARE THAT

06:11:28.466 --> 06:11:31.002
ARE CLARIFIED HERE. THERE'S ALSO

06:11:31.068 --> 06:11:32.670
A LEAST RESTRICTIVE MEANS

06:11:32.737 --> 06:11:35.539
NECESSARY THRESHOLD HERE. SO WE

06:11:35.606 --> 06:11:37.108
BELIEVE THAT THAT WOULD PREVENT

06:11:37.174 --> 06:11:38.809
THE SITUATION OF PEOPLE BEING

06:11:38.876 --> 06:11:41.078
HELD LONGER THAN THEY NEED TO

06:11:41.145 --> 06:11:42.713
JUST TO MEDICATE THEM. THAT IS

06:11:42.780 --> 06:11:44.782
THAT IS WE TRY TO BE VERY

06:11:44.849 --> 06:11:46.384
SPECIFIC ABOUT THAT HERE IN THE

06:11:46.450 --> 06:11:48.219
BILL AND THEN THE POINT FROM OUR

06:11:48.285 --> 06:11:51.288
FRIENDS AT DRC, JUST TO CLARIFY

06:11:51.355 --> 06:11:52.857
AND MAYBE, MAYBE THIS WE CAN

06:11:52.923 --> 06:11:54.558
KEEP TALKING ABOUT THIS GOING

06:11:54.625 --> 06:11:56.160
FORWARD, OBVIOUSLY. BUT THE NEW

06:11:56.227 --> 06:11:58.963
PROVISIONS IN SUBSECTION C THAT

06:11:59.030 --> 06:12:00.531
THEY HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED IN

06:12:00.598 --> 06:12:01.165
ADDITION TO THE OTHER

06:12:01.232 --> 06:12:02.533
REQUIREMENTS. SO IT'S NOT

06:12:02.600 --> 06:12:03.701
SUPPOSED TO DISPLACE THEM. BUT

06:12:03.768 --> 06:12:05.336
IF THAT'S A DRAFTING ISSUE,

06:12:05.403 --> 06:12:06.470
WE'RE HAPPY TO KEEP TALKING

06:12:06.537 --> 06:12:11.242
ABOUT THAT. I DO APPRECIATE THE

06:12:11.308 --> 06:12:13.277
GENUINE CONCERN FROM FROM THE

06:12:13.344 --> 06:12:14.879
OPPOSITION RIGHT NOW. AND THIS

06:12:14.945 --> 06:12:16.280
IS THE WORST PLACE FOR SOMEONE

06:12:16.347 --> 06:12:18.849
TO BE IN. I, I WISH WE DIDN'T

06:12:18.916 --> 06:12:20.618
HAVE TO RUN A BILL LIKE THIS OR

06:12:20.685 --> 06:12:21.852
HAVE TO DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES.

06:12:21.919 --> 06:12:23.421
AND TO SOME MEMBER GONZALEZ'S

06:12:23.487 --> 06:12:25.322
POINT THAT WE ACTUALLY DID OUR

06:12:25.389 --> 06:12:26.824
JOBS ON THE FRONT END AND DIDN'T

06:12:26.891 --> 06:12:29.860
LET PEOPLE. YOU KNOW, GET TO A

06:12:29.927 --> 06:12:31.762
SITUATION WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO

06:12:31.829 --> 06:12:32.830
DIE ON OUR STREETS OR THEY'RE

06:12:32.897 --> 06:12:34.031
COMMITTING CRIMES. BUT WHEREVER

06:12:34.098 --> 06:12:35.099
THEY ENTER OUR SYSTEM, WE WANT

06:12:35.166 --> 06:12:36.901
TO CARE FOR THEM. AND SO THIS IS

06:12:36.967 --> 06:12:39.103
ONE IF THEY IF THEY COME THROUGH

06:12:39.170 --> 06:12:40.738
THE JAILS, WE'RE GOING TO

06:12:40.805 --> 06:12:42.073
PROVIDE THE CARE. THEY'RE JUST

06:12:42.139 --> 06:12:43.674
LIKE WE WOULD ANYBODY ELSE. BUT

06:12:43.741 --> 06:12:44.341
WE'RE HOPING THIS IS A LIMITED

06:12:44.408 --> 06:12:46.544
TOOL THAT IS USED RARELY BUT

06:12:46.610 --> 06:12:48.012
SAVES LIVES. WITH THAT,

06:12:48.079 --> 06:12:49.413
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE.

06:12:49.480 --> 06:12:50.715
WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH,

06:12:50.781 --> 06:12:51.882
SENATOR STERN. JUST GOING TO DO

06:12:51.949 --> 06:12:54.051
A QUICK CALL OUT FOR VICE CHAIR

06:12:54.118 --> 06:12:56.087
ALANIS. IF YOUR STAFF LISTENING

06:12:56.153 --> 06:12:56.954
IN, PLEASE SEND HIM BACK.

06:12:57.021 --> 06:12:59.156
SENATOR STERN, YOU DO HAVE MY

06:12:59.223 --> 06:12:59.724
RECOMMENDATION, AND I JUST

06:12:59.790 --> 06:13:00.991
WANTED TO THANK THE OPPOSITION.

06:13:01.058 --> 06:13:02.593
I KNOW THAT MY RECOMMENDATION

06:13:02.660 --> 06:13:04.895
MAY DISAPPOINT. I THINK THAT THE

06:13:04.962 --> 06:13:06.297
ISSUES THAT YOU RAISED ARE

06:13:06.363 --> 06:13:08.265
ABSOLUTELY RIGHTEOUS. I THINK

06:13:08.332 --> 06:13:08.733
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS

06:13:08.799 --> 06:13:10.568
CIRCUMSTANCE IS UNFORTUNATE. I

06:13:10.634 --> 06:13:12.002
SEE WHAT THE SENATOR IS TRYING

06:13:12.069 --> 06:13:14.605
TO DO AND PREVENT THE

06:13:14.672 --> 06:13:15.639
DETERIORATION OF PEOPLE THAT

06:13:15.706 --> 06:13:17.007
SERIOUSLY NEED HELP AND

06:13:17.074 --> 06:13:18.175
TREATMENT, BUT DOING IT IN A WAY

06:13:18.242 --> 06:13:20.010
THAT IS COMPASSIONATE AND WITH

06:13:20.077 --> 06:13:21.545
DIGNITY AND WITH RESPECT TO

06:13:21.612 --> 06:13:22.646
THEIR AUTONOMY. I THINK THIS IS

06:13:22.713 --> 06:13:24.081
THE BALANCE THAT WE HAVE TO

06:13:24.148 --> 06:13:25.816
STRIKE. I THINK THE BILL HAS

06:13:25.883 --> 06:13:27.618
IMPROVED AS IT LEAVES COMMITTEE,

06:13:27.685 --> 06:13:29.687
AND I CAN SAY THAT IN THE TIME

06:13:29.754 --> 06:13:30.321
I'VE KNOWN SENATOR STERN, THERE

06:13:30.387 --> 06:13:32.189
ARE VERY FEW PEOPLE THAT I THINK

06:13:32.256 --> 06:13:34.191
ARE AS THOUGHTFUL AND CAREFUL

06:13:34.258 --> 06:13:34.792
AND WANT TO GET THIS ANSWER

06:13:34.859 --> 06:13:37.161
RIGHT. SO I HAVE FULL FAITH THAT

06:13:37.228 --> 06:13:37.661
YOU WILL CONTINUE THE

06:13:37.728 --> 06:13:38.529
CONVERSATION WITH THE

06:13:38.596 --> 06:13:40.197
OPPOSITION. AND I HOPE THAT THE

06:13:40.264 --> 06:13:41.499
FINAL VERSION, IT'S NEVER GOING

06:13:41.565 --> 06:13:42.633
TO SATISFY EVERYBODY, BUT I HOPE

06:13:42.700 --> 06:13:44.168
IT CAN SATISFY AS MANY CRITICS

06:13:44.235 --> 06:13:46.036
AS POSSIBLE. SO THANK YOU ALL.

06:13:46.103 --> 06:13:46.804
AND WITH THAT, WE HAVE A MOTION.

06:13:46.871 --> 06:13:48.839
AND A SECOND. LET'S CALL THE

06:13:48.906 --> 06:13:50.541
