00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:14.304
OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SB 18,

00:46:14.371 --> 00:46:15.639
REFERRED TO AS THE FOOD

00:46:15.706 --> 00:46:17.274
AFFORDABILITY ACT. THIS

00:46:17.341 --> 00:46:18.642
IMPORTANT BILL WILL HELP

00:46:18.709 --> 00:46:19.910
CALIFORNIA FAMILIES STRUGGLING

00:46:19.977 --> 00:46:21.879
WITH THE COST OF GROCERIES BY

00:46:21.945 --> 00:46:24.014
ENSURING THAT THE CALIFORNIA

00:46:24.081 --> 00:46:25.782
CALIFORNIANS LIVING IN FOOD

00:46:25.849 --> 00:46:27.551
DESERTS COMMUNITIES HAVE ACCESS

00:46:27.618 --> 00:46:29.353
TO AFFORDABLE, HEALTHY FOOD

00:46:29.419 --> 00:46:31.221
OPTIONS. EVERY CALIFORNIAN

00:46:31.288 --> 00:46:33.023
DESERVES ACCESS TO NUTRITIOUS

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:34.858
FOOD, BUT IN TOO MANY

00:46:34.925 --> 00:46:35.926
COMMUNITIES, YOU DON'T SEE THEM.

00:46:35.993 --> 00:46:37.694
YOU SEE LIQUOR STORES, YOU SEE

00:46:37.761 --> 00:46:39.329
FAST FOOD PLACES. AND THAT IS

00:46:39.396 --> 00:46:40.764
REALLY UNACCEPTABLE FOR OUR

00:46:40.831 --> 00:46:42.699
COMMUNITIES. RESIDENTS OF FOOD

00:46:42.766 --> 00:46:44.234
DESERTS MUST TRAVEL LONG

00:46:44.301 --> 00:46:46.303
DISTANCES, OFTEN TO FIND GROCERY

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:47.738
STORES WITH HEALTHY FOOD

00:46:47.804 --> 00:46:49.206
OPTIONS, OR ELSE THEY MUST

00:46:49.273 --> 00:46:50.674
RESIGN THEMSELVES TO RELYING ON

00:46:50.741 --> 00:46:53.177
THESE STORES. AS I MENTIONED,

00:46:53.243 --> 00:46:55.979
LESS HEALTHY AND THEIR FAST FOOD

00:46:56.046 --> 00:46:57.314
LIQUOR STORES. THAT'S NOT WHAT

00:46:57.381 --> 00:46:59.249
WE WANT OUR CHILDREN EATING. AND

00:46:59.316 --> 00:47:00.951
SO ONCE AGAIN, SB 18 WILL

00:47:01.018 --> 00:47:02.452
ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM BY

00:47:02.519 --> 00:47:03.887
INCREASING ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE,

00:47:03.954 --> 00:47:05.756
FRESH AND NUTRITIOUS FOOD FOR

00:47:05.822 --> 00:47:08.292
FAMILIES WITH NEEDS. THIS BILL

00:47:08.358 --> 00:47:10.093
WILL ESTABLISH THE FOOD DESERT

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:11.161
ELIMINATION GRANT PROGRAM UNDER

00:47:11.228 --> 00:47:12.896
THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

00:47:12.963 --> 00:47:14.698
FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. THE

00:47:14.765 --> 00:47:16.667
DEPARTMENT WILL BE AUTHORIZED TO

00:47:16.733 --> 00:47:18.669
AWARD GRANTS TO GROCERY STORES

00:47:18.735 --> 00:47:20.437
OPERATORS TO SUPPORT OPENING NEW

00:47:20.504 --> 00:47:22.406
GROCERY STORES OR IMPROVING

00:47:22.472 --> 00:47:23.774
EXISTING GROCERY STORES AND FOOD

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:26.176
DESERT COMMUNITIES. AS AN

00:47:26.243 --> 00:47:28.045
EDUCATOR, I CAN ATTEST THAT WHAT

00:47:28.111 --> 00:47:31.248
OUR STUDENTS EAT DOES DO

00:47:31.315 --> 00:47:32.749
OFTENTIMES AFFECT THE WAY THEY

00:47:32.816 --> 00:47:34.651
BEHAVE AND HOW THEY PERFORM, AND

00:47:34.718 --> 00:47:36.286
IT IMPACTS A CHILD'S ABILITY TO

00:47:36.353 --> 00:47:38.522
LEARN, TO GROW AND TO SUCCEED,

00:47:38.589 --> 00:47:40.290
CREATING A CYCLE OF DISADVANTAGE

00:47:40.357 --> 00:47:42.292
AND STUDENTS NOT BEING ABLE TO

00:47:42.359 --> 00:47:44.294
PERFORM AT THEIR FULL POTENTIAL.

00:47:44.361 --> 00:47:45.362
CALIFORNIA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY

00:47:45.429 --> 00:47:47.164
TODAY TO LEAD BY CREATING

00:47:47.231 --> 00:47:48.632
MEANINGFUL CHANGE AND ENSURING

00:47:48.699 --> 00:47:50.067
FAMILIES AND FOOD DESERTS HAVE

00:47:50.133 --> 00:47:52.569
ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOOD AS THEY

00:47:52.636 --> 00:47:54.137
DESERVE. AND EQUALLY IMPORTANT,

00:47:54.204 --> 00:47:56.106
AND SOMETIMES OVERLOOKED IN THE

00:47:56.173 --> 00:47:58.675
DISCUSSION IS BRINGING

00:47:58.742 --> 00:48:00.077
OPPORTUNITIES TO COMMUNITIES

00:48:00.143 --> 00:48:03.013
SUCH AS JOB CREATION AND

00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:05.515
ECONOMIC VITALITY, ESPECIALLY IN

00:48:05.582 --> 00:48:06.917
THESE ECONOMIC TIMES WHERE OUR

00:48:06.984 --> 00:48:08.085
COMMUNITIES NEED A LITTLE BIT OF

00:48:08.151 --> 00:48:10.854
BOOST IN THAT AREA. THIS IS, I

00:48:10.921 --> 00:48:12.956
THINK, A WIN WIN FOR EVERYONE.

00:48:13.023 --> 00:48:14.291
WE GET TO FEED OUR CHILDREN

00:48:14.358 --> 00:48:15.659
HEALTHIER OPTIONS. WE GET TO

00:48:15.726 --> 00:48:17.928
CREATE JOBS. WE GET TO IMPROVE

00:48:17.995 --> 00:48:19.696
THE SURROUNDING OF A COMMUNITY

00:48:19.763 --> 00:48:21.498
AND MAKE SURE THAT WE SUPPORT

00:48:21.565 --> 00:48:23.166
OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BY

00:48:23.233 --> 00:48:25.202
BRINGING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES.

00:48:25.269 --> 00:48:27.804
I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THIS

00:48:27.871 --> 00:48:29.373
BILL WAS SUPPORTED BY HEALTH

00:48:29.439 --> 00:48:30.307
ORGANIZATIONS AND LOCAL

00:48:30.374 --> 00:48:32.509
GOVERNMENTS, AND THAT IS WHY IT

00:48:32.576 --> 00:48:34.278
PASSED IN THE SENATE WITH

00:48:34.344 --> 00:48:37.914
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT, 38 TO 0, NO,

00:48:37.981 --> 00:48:40.183
NO VOTES. AND WITH ME, I HAVE

00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:41.551
SOMEONE THAT WILL SPEAK ON

00:48:41.618 --> 00:48:42.853
BEHALF OF THIS. BILL TAYLOR

00:48:42.919 --> 00:48:44.054
TRUFFLE, ON BEHALF OF THE

00:48:44.121 --> 00:48:45.889
CALIFORNIA GROCERS ASSOCIATION,

00:48:45.956 --> 00:48:48.325
IF I MAY TURN IT OVER TO. GREAT.

00:48:48.392 --> 00:48:50.460
SO WE WILL NOW HEAR FROM THOSE

00:48:50.527 --> 00:48:52.129
TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT. PLEASE

00:48:52.195 --> 00:48:53.497
PROCEED. GOOD AFTERNOON, MADAM

00:48:53.563 --> 00:48:54.865
CHAIR AND MEMBERS. TAYLOR TRÊN,

00:48:54.931 --> 00:48:56.233
ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA

00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:57.434
GROCERS ASSOCIATION, AS SPONSORS

00:48:57.501 --> 00:48:59.303
OF SB 18, AND WE OFFER OUR

00:48:59.369 --> 00:49:00.504
THANKS TO SENATOR RUBIO.

00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:02.406
CALIFORNIA GROCERS REPRESENT A

00:49:02.472 --> 00:49:03.940
WIDE VARIETY OF GROCERY STORES

00:49:04.007 --> 00:49:05.575
HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THOSE CHAINS

00:49:05.642 --> 00:49:06.977
THAT YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND, AND

00:49:07.044 --> 00:49:08.178
THEN ALSO INDEPENDENT ETHNIC

00:49:08.245 --> 00:49:09.546
MARKETS AND SMALLER MARKETS AS

00:49:09.613 --> 00:49:11.882
WELL. FOOD INSECURITY NOW

00:49:11.948 --> 00:49:13.717
AFFECTS ONE IN EVERY FIVE

00:49:13.784 --> 00:49:14.751
CALIFORNIANS. AND I THINK, AS

00:49:14.818 --> 00:49:16.953
ALL OF US HAVE COME TO

00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:17.988
UNDERSTAND AS BUYERS, FOOD

00:49:18.055 --> 00:49:18.989
AFFORDABILITY IS A MAJOR

00:49:19.056 --> 00:49:21.525
COMPONENT OF THE INSECURITY. BUT

00:49:21.591 --> 00:49:22.693
AND FOR THESE REASONS, IS REALLY

00:49:22.759 --> 00:49:24.027
PROUD TO WORK WITH ADVOCATES TO

00:49:24.094 --> 00:49:25.796
PROTECT SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFITS,

00:49:25.862 --> 00:49:26.897
TO EXPAND STATE PROGRAMS LIKE

00:49:26.963 --> 00:49:28.965
FRUIT AND VEGETABLE EBT PROGRAM,

00:49:29.032 --> 00:49:30.200
TO INCREASE FARM TO SCHOOL AND

00:49:30.267 --> 00:49:31.935
CONTINUE DONATIONS TO VULNERABLE

00:49:32.002 --> 00:49:33.170
COMMUNITIES. BUT INSECURITY IS

00:49:33.236 --> 00:49:34.271
MORE THAN JUST ABOUT

00:49:34.338 --> 00:49:35.238
AFFORDABILITY. IT'S ALSO ABOUT

00:49:35.305 --> 00:49:36.340
ACCESS. AS THE SENATOR

00:49:36.406 --> 00:49:37.741
MENTIONED, DESPITE CALIFORNIA'S

00:49:37.808 --> 00:49:38.675
AGRICULTURAL ABUNDANCE, WHICH

00:49:38.742 --> 00:49:39.810
THIS COMMITTEE SPEAKS ABOUT

00:49:39.876 --> 00:49:42.012
FREQUENTLY, RURAL AND URBAN

00:49:42.079 --> 00:49:42.846
NEIGHBORHOODS SIMPLY HAVE NO

00:49:42.913 --> 00:49:44.781
ACCESS TO STORES. THOSE OF YOU

00:49:44.848 --> 00:49:47.317
IN A RURAL AREA, I THINK,

00:49:47.384 --> 00:49:48.151
UNDERSTAND THAT PROXIMITY IS

00:49:48.218 --> 00:49:49.853
ESSENTIAL, BUT THE URBAN ISSUES

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:51.722
ARE ARE ALSO A PROBLEM. IN LA,

00:49:51.788 --> 00:49:53.190
THE MOST POPULATED COUNTY IN THE

00:49:53.256 --> 00:49:54.558
STATE, OVER A QUARTER MILLION

00:49:54.624 --> 00:49:56.460
HOUSEHOLDS LIVE IN A FOOD

00:49:56.526 --> 00:49:57.394
DESERT. AND YET IT'S

00:49:57.461 --> 00:49:58.328
INCREASINGLY CHALLENGING FOR

00:49:58.395 --> 00:49:59.629
CALIFORNIA GROCERS, WITH MARGINS

00:49:59.696 --> 00:50:02.899
OF 1 TO 2%. TO RESPOND TO THIS

00:50:02.966 --> 00:50:04.801
OUTSTANDING NEED, SB 18 HELPS TO

00:50:04.868 --> 00:50:06.436
FILL THIS GAP BY SUPPORTING THE

00:50:06.503 --> 00:50:07.904
SITING AND IMPROVEMENTS OF

00:50:07.971 --> 00:50:09.406
EXISTING GROCERY STORES AND FOOD

00:50:09.473 --> 00:50:10.674
DESERTS, WHERE ACCESS IS LIMITED

00:50:10.741 --> 00:50:13.043
OR NONEXISTENT. IT BUILDS ON OUR

00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:14.244
EXISTING WORK TO INCREASE FRESH

00:50:14.311 --> 00:50:16.313
FOOD AND CORNER STORES THROUGH

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:16.847
THE HEALTHY REFRIGERATION

00:50:16.913 --> 00:50:18.715
PROGRAM AT CDFA AND FARMERS

00:50:18.782 --> 00:50:20.083
MARKETS, AND INCREASING BENEFIT

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:21.985
WITH ANOTHER STRATEGIC SOLUTION

00:50:22.052 --> 00:50:23.653
HELP NEW STORES OPEN AND EXPAND

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:25.122
IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. THE

00:50:25.188 --> 00:50:26.823
BILL MIRRORS SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS

00:50:26.890 --> 00:50:28.225
OF OTHER STATES LIKE

00:50:28.291 --> 00:50:29.459
PENNSYLVANIA AND ILLINOIS, AND

00:50:29.526 --> 00:50:30.827
BUILDS ON CALIFORNIA PILOTS LIKE

00:50:30.894 --> 00:50:32.996
THOSE LED BY CAL ENDOWMENT. WITH

00:50:33.063 --> 00:50:34.164
NORTHGATE MARKETS THAT HAVE

00:50:34.231 --> 00:50:36.500
PROVEN SUCCESS. WE RECOGNIZE

00:50:36.566 --> 00:50:37.868
THAT STORES NEED TO BE SUPPORTED

00:50:37.934 --> 00:50:39.770
BY THEIR COMMUNITY AND MAINTAIN.

00:50:39.836 --> 00:50:41.438
AND I KNOW THERE'S QUESTIONS

00:50:41.505 --> 00:50:43.306
ABOUT GUARDRAILS, WHICH WE ARE

00:50:43.373 --> 00:50:44.941
WHY WE'RE ANTICIPATING A VERY

00:50:45.008 --> 00:50:45.709
ROBUST STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AT

00:50:45.776 --> 00:50:48.345
THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND

00:50:48.412 --> 00:50:48.979
AGRICULTURE TO SHAPE THE FUTURE

00:50:49.045 --> 00:50:49.646
OF THE PROGRAM. THAT DEPARTMENT

00:50:49.713 --> 00:50:51.181
HAS A REALLY STRONG LEGACY OF

00:50:51.248 --> 00:50:52.649
HOLDING EQUITY AS A CORE TENET

00:50:52.716 --> 00:50:54.151
OF ALL OF THEIR GRANT PROGRAMS,

00:50:54.217 --> 00:50:56.953
AND I'M HAPPY TO GO INTO MORE

00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:57.554
DETAIL ON THAT LATER. BEYOND

00:50:57.621 --> 00:50:58.088
PROVIDING ACCESS, WE ALSO

00:50:58.155 --> 00:51:00.090
BELIEVE SB 18 WOULD HELP DRIVE

00:51:00.157 --> 00:51:00.957
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. GROCERY

00:51:01.024 --> 00:51:02.359
STORES ARE OFTEN THE ANCHOR

00:51:02.426 --> 00:51:03.760
STORES IN SHOPPING CENTERS,

00:51:03.827 --> 00:51:05.228
ENCOURAGING CONSISTENT CONSUMER

00:51:05.295 --> 00:51:06.663
TRAFFIC AND ATTRACTING NEW

00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:08.098
BUSINESSES. AND IMPORTANTLY, AS

00:51:08.165 --> 00:51:09.800
OUR STATE BUDGET SUFFERS, THE

00:51:09.866 --> 00:51:11.334
BILL PLACES CALIFORNIA IN A

00:51:11.401 --> 00:51:12.702
POSITION TO COMPETE FOR PRIVATE

00:51:12.769 --> 00:51:14.304
AND REMAINING FEDERAL DOLLARS

00:51:14.371 --> 00:51:16.339
AND DELIVER RESOURCES FOR OUR

00:51:16.406 --> 00:51:18.642
COMMUNITIES. FOR THESE REASONS,

00:51:18.708 --> 00:51:19.276
WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE

00:51:19.342 --> 00:51:22.145
VOTE. THANK YOU. GREAT. THANK

00:51:22.212 --> 00:51:24.848
YOU. WE WILL NOW HEAR IF THERE'S

00:51:24.915 --> 00:51:28.285
ANYONE ELSE. YOU ONLY HAVE ONE

00:51:28.351 --> 00:51:29.953
WITNESS. OKAY, PERFECT. WE WILL

00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:32.155
NOW HEAR FROM THOSE TESTIFYING

00:51:32.222 --> 00:51:34.958
IN OPPOSITION. IF YOU CAN,

00:51:35.025 --> 00:51:51.274
PLEASE PROCEED.

00:51:52.676 --> 00:51:54.277
AGAIN, IF YOU CAN, PLEASE STATE

00:51:54.344 --> 00:51:55.812
YOUR NAME AND THE ORGANIZATION

00:51:55.879 --> 00:51:57.247
YOU'RE HERE REPRESENTING. YOU

00:51:57.314 --> 00:51:59.249
MAY PROCEED. GOOD AFTERNOON,

00:51:59.316 --> 00:52:00.116
CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE

00:52:00.183 --> 00:52:01.985
COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS ESTHER

00:52:02.052 --> 00:52:03.386
PAMINTUAN, AND I'M HERE ON

00:52:03.453 --> 00:52:04.287
BEHALF OF ALAMEDA COUNTY

00:52:04.354 --> 00:52:05.689
COMMUNITY FOOD BANK AND THE

00:52:05.755 --> 00:52:07.090
CALIFORNIA FOOD AND FARMING

00:52:07.157 --> 00:52:08.358
NETWORK TO RESPECTFULLY EXPRESS

00:52:08.425 --> 00:52:10.727
OUR POSITION ON SB 18 OF OPPOSE,

00:52:10.794 --> 00:52:12.762
UNLESS AMENDED. LET ME STRESS

00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:14.598
THIS WE ARE IMMENSELY GRATEFUL

00:52:14.664 --> 00:52:15.999
FOR SENATOR RUBIO'S RECORD AS AN

00:52:16.066 --> 00:52:17.901
ANTI HUNGER FIGHTER, INCLUDING

00:52:17.968 --> 00:52:19.970
THIS YEAR CHAMPIONING MEDICALLY

00:52:20.036 --> 00:52:21.271
SUPPORTIVE FOOD AND NUTRITION.

00:52:21.338 --> 00:52:22.739
BUT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS

00:52:22.806 --> 00:52:24.941
BILL'S POTENTIAL UNINTENDED

00:52:25.008 --> 00:52:27.043
CONSEQUENCES. HUNGER IS STILL AN

00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:28.945
EMERGENCY. OUR FOOD BANK

00:52:29.012 --> 00:52:30.347
DISTRIBUTES NEARLY 1 MILLION

00:52:30.413 --> 00:52:32.782
MEALS PER WEEK. WE SOURCE OVER

00:52:32.849 --> 00:52:34.384
80% OF OUR PURCHASED PRODUCE

00:52:34.451 --> 00:52:36.486
FROM BIPOC FARMERS, WHICH HAS

00:52:36.553 --> 00:52:37.854
INCREASED OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE

00:52:37.921 --> 00:52:39.623
CULTURALLY RELEVANT FOODS AND

00:52:39.689 --> 00:52:41.291
SUPPORTS THE COMMUNITIES MOST AT

00:52:41.358 --> 00:52:42.993
RISK OF EXPERIENCING FOOD

00:52:43.059 --> 00:52:44.628
INSECURITY. THIS IS THE LENS BY

00:52:44.694 --> 00:52:46.596
WHICH WE EVALUATE SB 18 AS

00:52:46.663 --> 00:52:48.398
WRITTEN TODAY. IN SUMMARY, WE

00:52:48.465 --> 00:52:51.501
HAVE THREE CONCERNS. FIRST, FOOD

00:52:51.568 --> 00:52:52.869
INSECURITY IS ABOUT MUCH MORE

00:52:52.936 --> 00:52:55.205
THAN JUST PROXIMITY TO A STORE.

00:52:55.272 --> 00:52:56.640
BUILDING A GROCERY STORE DOESN'T

00:52:56.706 --> 00:52:58.074
ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSES OF

00:52:58.141 --> 00:52:59.809
HUNGER, LIKE LOW WAGES AND HIGH

00:52:59.876 --> 00:53:02.312
FOOD COSTS. SECOND, THE BILL

00:53:02.379 --> 00:53:04.648
LACKS COMMUNITY INPUT AND

00:53:04.714 --> 00:53:06.016
ACCOUNTABILITY, WITHOUT WHICH

00:53:06.082 --> 00:53:07.784
TAXPAYER DOLLARS COULD BE WASTED

00:53:07.851 --> 00:53:10.287
AND COMMUNITIES LEFT WORSE OFF.

00:53:10.353 --> 00:53:12.222
THIRD, SB 18 COULD ACTUALLY

00:53:12.289 --> 00:53:14.624
DEEPEN FOOD INSECURITY. LARGE

00:53:14.691 --> 00:53:16.092
GROCERY STORE CHAINS ALREADY

00:53:16.159 --> 00:53:18.562
RECEIVE SUBSIDIES AND LOG RECORD

00:53:18.628 --> 00:53:20.363
PROFITS, YET STILL CLOSE AND

00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:22.332
CONSOLIDATE STORES. INVESTING IN

00:53:22.399 --> 00:53:24.768
BIG BOX STORES SIDELINE SMALL

00:53:24.834 --> 00:53:26.803
FARMERS, LOCAL GROCERS AND

00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:28.672
COOPERATIVES. BUT WE HAVE A

00:53:28.738 --> 00:53:30.440
BLUEPRINT FOR MAKING SB 18

00:53:30.507 --> 00:53:31.908
BETTER. RATHER THAN INVESTMENT

00:53:31.975 --> 00:53:34.177
IN THE STATUS QUO, WE ARE URGING

00:53:34.244 --> 00:53:35.545
FOR AMENDMENTS THAT PRIORITIZE

00:53:35.612 --> 00:53:37.614
COMMUNITY AND TRIBAL LED RETAIL

00:53:37.681 --> 00:53:39.950
AND BIPOC OWNED BUSINESSES

00:53:40.016 --> 00:53:41.351
REQUIRE ROBUST COMMUNITY INPUT

00:53:41.418 --> 00:53:43.320
AND STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT, AND

00:53:43.386 --> 00:53:44.754
ENSURE LONG TERM COMMITMENTS

00:53:44.821 --> 00:53:46.756
FROM GRANTEES TO STAY IN THE

00:53:46.823 --> 00:53:48.191
COMMUNITY. OUR OBJECTIONS LIE

00:53:48.258 --> 00:53:49.993
NOT WITH THE INTENT OF THIS

00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:51.227
BILL, BUT WITH THE MECHANISMS

00:53:51.294 --> 00:53:52.796
FOR PURSUING IT. I URGE YOU TO

00:53:52.862 --> 00:53:54.331
SUPPORT STRONGER, COMMUNITY

00:53:54.397 --> 00:53:56.199
CENTERED AMENDMENTS BEFORE

00:53:56.266 --> 00:53:57.801
MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD. THANK

00:53:57.867 --> 00:54:01.938
YOU. THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE

00:54:02.005 --> 00:54:06.843
OTHER. HAND, MADAM CHAIR, AND

00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:10.013
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE? SHARON

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:12.649
WARREN NETANYAHU NOT TO KNOCK.

00:54:12.716 --> 00:54:15.485
HI, DAD. I'M REALLY GLAD TO SEE

00:54:15.552 --> 00:54:17.253
EVERYONE HERE TODAY. I'M A

00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:18.655
MEMBER OF THE HOOPA TRIBE, BUT

00:54:18.722 --> 00:54:19.889
I'M ALSO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

00:54:19.956 --> 00:54:21.191
OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN

00:54:21.257 --> 00:54:22.525
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

00:54:22.592 --> 00:54:25.495
COALITION, WHICH HAS 30, 30

00:54:25.562 --> 00:54:27.330
MEMBERS STRONG. WE'RE 30 TRIBES

00:54:27.397 --> 00:54:28.765
BELONG TO OUR ORGANIZATION. I

00:54:28.832 --> 00:54:31.267
HAVE HAD THE GREAT OPPORTUNITY

00:54:31.334 --> 00:54:33.803
TO TRAVEL TO 98 OF THE

00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:36.039
RESERVATIONS IN CALIFORNIA. IN

00:54:36.106 --> 00:54:38.408
TRAVELING TO THESE RESERVATIONS,

00:54:38.475 --> 00:54:40.644
I PASS COMMUNITY LIKE LOS BANOS.

00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:43.947
I GO TO LONE PINE. I HAD TO

00:54:44.014 --> 00:54:46.349
WRITE THEM DOWN. ALTURAS,

00:54:46.416 --> 00:54:48.151
BRIDGEPORT. THESE ARE ALL RURAL

00:54:48.218 --> 00:54:50.387
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE NOT

00:54:50.453 --> 00:54:51.788
NECESSARILY TRIBAL COMMUNITIES,

00:54:51.855 --> 00:54:54.357
BUT THEY FACE SIMILAR PROBLEMS.

00:54:54.424 --> 00:54:56.826
THIS IS A COMPLEX ISSUE THAT

00:54:56.893 --> 00:54:58.995
REQUIRES A COMPLEX SOLUTION, BUT

00:54:59.062 --> 00:55:01.164
IT REQUIRES MORE THAN THAT. THE

00:55:01.231 --> 00:55:04.434
SOLUTION OF ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT OF

00:55:04.501 --> 00:55:05.168
COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS. AND I'M

00:55:05.235 --> 00:55:07.103
GOING TO GIVE YOU THE STORY OF

00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:09.472
HOOPA AS AN EXAMPLE. AS A RURAL

00:55:09.539 --> 00:55:11.274
COMMUNITY, HISTORICALLY, WE

00:55:11.341 --> 00:55:13.877
ALWAYS HAD TWO GROCERY STORES,

00:55:13.943 --> 00:55:15.912
TWO SMALL, PRIVATELY OWNED LOCAL

00:55:15.979 --> 00:55:17.480
COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO OWN THOSE

00:55:17.547 --> 00:55:19.949
GROCERY STORES IN OUR COMMUNITY.

00:55:20.016 --> 00:55:21.651
ALSO 12 MILES AWAY IN WILLOW

00:55:21.718 --> 00:55:24.287
CREEK, WAS ALSO TWO GROCERY

00:55:24.354 --> 00:55:27.123
STORES. GUESS WHAT? BIG CHAIN

00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:28.958
GROCERY STORE CAME IN. AND GUESS

00:55:29.025 --> 00:55:30.393
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LOCAL

00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:32.162
COMMUNITY? GROCERY STORES? THEY

00:55:32.228 --> 00:55:33.963
WERE CLOSED DOWN. CLOSED DOWN

00:55:34.030 --> 00:55:35.765
BECAUSE THEY WERE THEY COULDN'T

00:55:35.832 --> 00:55:38.568
COMPETE AT THE SAME LEVEL. AS A

00:55:38.635 --> 00:55:40.103
RESULT, THE COMMUNITY WAS LEFT

00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:42.706
WITH ONE GROCERY STORE CHAIN

00:55:42.772 --> 00:55:45.875
OPERATED. THERE WAS NEVER A

00:55:45.942 --> 00:55:48.545
TRIBAL MANAGER. YES. DID OUR DID

00:55:48.611 --> 00:55:50.513
OUR TRIBAL MEMBERS BECOME

00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:52.716
EMPLOYED? YES. MAINLY JANITORS

00:55:52.782 --> 00:55:55.585
AND CASHIERS, BUT NEVER AT THE

00:55:55.652 --> 00:55:59.422
MANAGEMENT LEVEL. AND WHEN THAT

00:55:59.489 --> 00:56:01.958
STORE WAS SHUT DOWN BY THE

00:56:02.025 --> 00:56:04.994
COUNTY, I MIGHT ADD, IT DECIDED

00:56:05.061 --> 00:56:06.996
TO LEAVE COMPLETELY. AND IT

00:56:07.063 --> 00:56:09.599
LEFT. BASICALLY OUR COMMUNITY

00:56:09.666 --> 00:56:11.768
OVERNIGHT. THERE WAS NOTHING

00:56:11.835 --> 00:56:14.270
LEFT. SO THE TRIBE OWNING A GAS

00:56:14.337 --> 00:56:16.940
STATION, WE HAD TO WORK A FIX,

00:56:17.006 --> 00:56:20.043
RIGHT? WELL, WE TRIED TO SOLICIT

00:56:20.110 --> 00:56:21.845
GROCERY STORE CHAIN AFTER

00:56:21.911 --> 00:56:23.246
GROCERY STORE, CHAIN AFTER

00:56:23.313 --> 00:56:25.148
GROCERY STORE CHAIN TO COME IN

00:56:25.215 --> 00:56:27.183
AND BE A PART OF OUR COMMUNITY.

00:56:27.250 --> 00:56:28.752
BUT GUESS WHAT? THEY WEREN'T

00:56:28.818 --> 00:56:30.120
INTERESTED IN BECOMING A PART OF

00:56:30.186 --> 00:56:32.322
OUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE THE BOTTOM

00:56:32.388 --> 00:56:34.724
LINE WASN'T BIG ENOUGH FOR THEM.

00:56:34.791 --> 00:56:38.094
SO THIS THRUST THE TRIBE INTO A

00:56:38.161 --> 00:56:39.496
POSITION OF HAVING TO DEVELOP

00:56:39.562 --> 00:56:41.397
OUR OWN GROCERY STORE. AND WE

00:56:41.464 --> 00:56:43.433
DID IT FIRST BY REALLY EXAMINING

00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:44.868
WHAT WERE OUR WHAT WERE OUR

00:56:44.934 --> 00:56:46.603
NEEDS, WHAT REALLY WERE OUR

00:56:46.669 --> 00:56:50.640
NEEDS. OUR POPULATION HAS LIVES

00:56:50.707 --> 00:56:53.943
AT BELOW THE 200% POVERTY LEVEL.

00:56:54.010 --> 00:56:56.012
SO WE KNOW THAT OUR COMMUNITY

00:56:56.079 --> 00:56:57.113
MEMBERS ARE SUFFERING NOT JUST

00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:59.215
TRIBAL, BUT NON-TRIBAL AS WELL.

00:56:59.282 --> 00:57:01.684
WE BUILT A GROCERY STORE THAT

00:57:01.751 --> 00:57:03.586
ANSWERED THE NEEDS OF THE

00:57:03.653 --> 00:57:05.755
COMMUNITY. WE HAVE LOCAL LOCAL

00:57:05.822 --> 00:57:07.257
FARMERS, BOTH TRIBAL AND

00:57:07.323 --> 00:57:08.658
NON-TRIBAL, WHO SELL ITEMS TO

00:57:08.725 --> 00:57:11.060
THE STORE. WE HAVE A DIABETIC

00:57:11.127 --> 00:57:13.696
SECTION, A WHOLE ROW OF FOODS

00:57:13.763 --> 00:57:14.998
FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIABETES AND

00:57:15.064 --> 00:57:17.367
ARE BATTLING THAT. WE ALSO

00:57:17.433 --> 00:57:18.334
ENSURE THAT OUR GROCERY STORE

00:57:18.401 --> 00:57:20.503
DOES NOT GOUGE THE PRICES OF

00:57:20.570 --> 00:57:23.072
ESSENTIAL ITEMS LIKE BREAD,

00:57:23.139 --> 00:57:25.975
MILK, CHEESE, HAMBURGER. THESE

00:57:26.042 --> 00:57:27.710
ARE THE KINDS OF WAYS IN WHICH

00:57:27.777 --> 00:57:29.913
YOU FIX THIS ISSUE. SO LASTLY, I

00:57:29.979 --> 00:57:32.048
JUST WANT TO IMPLORE UPON YOU

00:57:32.115 --> 00:57:33.650
THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT CAN'T

00:57:33.716 --> 00:57:35.585
BE FIXED IN WITH A SINGLE

00:57:35.652 --> 00:57:37.687
APPROACH BY A BIG STORE, GROCERY

00:57:37.754 --> 00:57:40.690

HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AT

00:59:11.981 --> 00:59:15.752
THIS TIME? WERE THERE AMENDMENTS

00:59:15.818 --> 00:59:17.553
ON THIS BILL? DID YOU TAKE

00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:20.156
AMENDMENTS THERE? NO, THERE WERE

00:59:20.223 --> 00:59:22.725
NO AMENDMENTS TAKEN. YEAH. I

00:59:22.792 --> 00:59:24.460
JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS IN

00:59:24.527 --> 00:59:25.795
MY CONCERNS. I VOTED FOR A

00:59:25.862 --> 00:59:27.230
SIMILAR BILL LIKE THIS BEFORE,

00:59:27.297 --> 00:59:29.599
AND IT WAS BROUGHT UP TO ME JUST

00:59:29.666 --> 00:59:32.001
AS I WALKED IN HERE TODAY. I DID

00:59:32.068 --> 00:59:33.703
VOTE FOR THEM IN THE PAST, BUT

00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:35.338
WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY OPPOSITION ON

00:59:35.405 --> 00:59:37.974
IT. NOW WE HAVE SOME OPPOSITION.

00:59:38.041 --> 00:59:40.143
EVERY COMMUNITY UP AND DOWN THE

00:59:40.209 --> 00:59:43.046
STATE IS DIFFERENT AND I'M

00:59:43.112 --> 00:59:45.348
WANTING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE

00:59:45.415 --> 00:59:48.217
ADDRESS FOOD INSECURITY. I LOOK

00:59:48.284 --> 00:59:50.453
AT MY LITTLE TOWN. I HAVE ONE

00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:52.422
GROCERY STORE AND THEY'RE

00:59:52.488 --> 00:59:53.957
STRUGGLING, SO IT'S ONLY A

00:59:54.023 --> 00:59:56.192
MATTER OF TIME THAT WE DON'T

00:59:56.259 --> 00:59:57.860
KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. BUT

00:59:57.927 --> 00:59:58.962
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW

00:59:59.028 --> 01:00:01.397
DO YOU GET MORE LOCALLY GROWN OR

01:00:01.464 --> 01:00:03.967
NICE GROCERY STORES IN YOUR

01:00:04.033 --> 01:00:05.134
DISTRICT? AND IT ALWAYS COMES

01:00:05.201 --> 01:00:07.236
BACK TO POPULATION, AND IF YOU

01:00:07.303 --> 01:00:08.705
CAN'T MEET THE POPULATION, IT'S

01:00:08.771 --> 01:00:10.573
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. SO I JUST

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:13.076
WANTED TO THROW THAT OUT THERE.

01:00:13.142 --> 01:00:14.978
WE KNOW THAT THE FEDERAL PROGRAM

01:00:15.044 --> 01:00:16.579
EXISTS AND ALREADY OFFERS

01:00:16.646 --> 01:00:18.681
SUPPORT FOR THE ISSUE. WHY CAN'T

01:00:18.748 --> 01:00:20.516
GROCERS APPLY DIRECTLY FOR THESE

01:00:20.583 --> 01:00:21.918
FUNDS WITHOUT A NEW STATE

01:00:21.985 --> 01:00:25.154
PROGRAM? WITH THE CHAIR'S

01:00:25.221 --> 01:00:27.056
PERMISSION? YEAH. GO AHEAD.

01:00:27.123 --> 01:00:28.925
PROCEED. SO UNDER THE EXISTING

01:00:28.992 --> 01:00:30.626
FEDERAL STANDARDS, GROCERS COULD

01:00:30.693 --> 01:00:31.728
APPLY FOR THOSE DOLLARS. WHAT

01:00:31.794 --> 01:00:33.062
WE'RE HOPING IS THAT WE'D BE

01:00:33.129 --> 01:00:35.031
ABLE TO CATALYZE ADDITIONAL NGO

01:00:35.098 --> 01:00:35.932
DOLLARS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE

01:00:35.999 --> 01:00:37.834
ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE, ESPECIALLY

01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:39.502
SERVICING SOME OF THOSE SMALLER

01:00:39.569 --> 01:00:40.903
GROWERS, GROCERS THAT WOULD BE

01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:41.871
INTERESTED IN GOING INTO THOSE

01:00:41.938 --> 01:00:43.439
AREAS THAT HAVEN'T PREVIOUSLY

01:00:43.506 --> 01:00:44.674
BEEN SERVED. SO I THINK WE FIND

01:00:44.741 --> 01:00:46.175
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME SYNERGY

01:00:46.242 --> 01:00:47.643
WITH OUR NONPROFIT PARTNERS IN

01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:49.545
ORDER TO DO THAT. AND THAT'S HOW

01:00:49.612 --> 01:00:51.014
THE CAL ENDOWMENT PROGRAM WAS

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.648
ABLE TO OPEN. NORTHGATE MARKET

01:00:52.715 --> 01:00:54.150
DOWN IN WEST LOS ANGELES WAS ALL

01:00:54.217 --> 01:00:55.885
THROUGH NONPROFIT DOLLARS.

01:00:55.952 --> 01:00:57.787
LARGER AREA BY FAR. BUT WHAT ARE

01:00:57.854 --> 01:01:00.056
WE GOING TO DO IF THE FEDERAL

01:01:00.123 --> 01:01:00.957
GOVERNMENT DOESN'T PROVIDE THE

01:01:01.024 --> 01:01:01.891
FUNDING THAT WE'RE HOPING FOR? I

01:01:01.958 --> 01:01:03.793
MEAN, THAT'S WHAT MAKES ME

01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:05.561
NERVOUS, BECAUSE DO I WANT THIS

01:01:05.628 --> 01:01:06.562
TO SUCCEED? ABSOLUTELY. BUT I AM

01:01:06.629 --> 01:01:08.264
REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT WHERE ARE

01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:10.867
WE GOING? WHERE ARE WE GOING TO

01:01:10.933 --> 01:01:13.169
LAND ON THIS? I MEMBER THAT'S A

01:01:13.236 --> 01:01:14.904
GREAT QUESTION. SO AS OF RIGHT

01:01:14.971 --> 01:01:15.772
NOW, THE FAIR FUNDING, AT LEAST

01:01:15.838 --> 01:01:17.907
AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL, IS STILL

01:01:17.974 --> 01:01:18.775
AVAILABLE. IT'S NOT BEEN A PART

01:01:18.841 --> 01:01:20.877
OF THE DOGE CUTBACKS THAT

01:01:20.943 --> 01:01:22.512
ACTUALLY JUST RELEASED ABOUT $16

01:01:22.578 --> 01:01:23.846
MILLION IN THE FIRST ROUND. THEY

01:01:23.913 --> 01:01:26.049
HAVE A SECOND ROUND THAT'S GOING

01:01:26.115 --> 01:01:27.250
TO BE RELEASED IN OCTOBER OF

01:01:27.316 --> 01:01:28.618
NEXT YEAR. AND THEN THERE'S

01:01:28.684 --> 01:01:29.519
ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

01:01:29.585 --> 01:01:30.753
COMPONENTS AND OTHER THINGS. SO

01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:32.922
OUR HOPE WITH THIS BILL IS TO

01:01:32.989 --> 01:01:33.589
CREATE AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S

01:01:33.656 --> 01:01:35.691
IN PLACE THAT ALLOWS CALIFORNIA

01:01:35.758 --> 01:01:36.893
TO BE COMPETITIVE FOR THOSE

01:01:36.959 --> 01:01:38.327
DOLLARS. SO WE'RE NOT SEEING ONE

01:01:38.394 --> 01:01:40.129
OFF GROCERY STORES MAKE

01:01:40.196 --> 01:01:41.297
INDIVIDUAL PROJECT SPECIFIC

01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:42.331
DECISIONS, BUT THAT WE HAVE A

01:01:42.398 --> 01:01:43.332
COORDINATED EFFORT THROUGH THE

01:01:43.399 --> 01:01:44.033
DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:45.601
AGRICULTURE TO MAKE THOSE

01:01:45.668 --> 01:01:47.336
CHOICES. IF I WAS ASSURED THAT

01:01:47.403 --> 01:01:49.072
THE GROCERS WOULD FOLLOW

01:01:49.138 --> 01:01:50.640
THROUGH, FEEL BETTER ABOUT IT

01:01:50.706 --> 01:01:52.175
BECAUSE I WORRY ABOUT MY SMALL

01:01:52.241 --> 01:01:53.876
GUY. ABSOLUTELY. AND I THINK WE

01:01:53.943 --> 01:01:56.179
ALL HAVE TO AGREE IS THAT, YOU

01:01:56.245 --> 01:01:56.846
KNOW, UNFORTUNATELY, AND I HATE

01:01:56.913 --> 01:01:58.147
TO SAY THIS BECAUSE I'M ON

01:01:58.214 --> 01:02:00.483
CAMERA, YOU KNOW, I CAN GO INTO

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:01.717
MY GROCERY STORE RIGHT NOW AND

01:02:01.784 --> 01:02:03.286
IT'S STRUGGLING SO MUCH IS THAT

01:02:03.352 --> 01:02:04.954
THEY'RE NOT BEING ABLE TO ROTATE

01:02:05.021 --> 01:02:07.290
FOOD AROUND. IT'S JUST YOUR LAST

01:02:07.356 --> 01:02:08.958
CHANCE TO WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO

01:02:09.025 --> 01:02:10.793
GO. AND IT'S 12 MILES AWAY TO

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:12.795
THE NEAREST GROCERY STORE. SO

01:02:12.862 --> 01:02:14.831
YEAH, I HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT

01:02:14.897 --> 01:02:16.732
THIS AS THE WAY IT IS RIGHT NOW,

01:02:16.799 --> 01:02:18.568
BUT I WAS HOPING THERE'S GOING

01:02:18.634 --> 01:02:20.570
TO BE SOME CHANGES TO THE BILL.

01:02:20.636 --> 01:02:21.537
SO THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:02:21.604 --> 01:02:24.373
CONLEY. THANK YOU CHAIR. JUST

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.943
WANTED TO KIND OF EXPRESS SOME

01:02:27.009 --> 01:02:28.845
SIMILAR SENTIMENTS, STARTING

01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:30.012
WITH THE APPRECIATE THE INTENT

01:02:30.079 --> 01:02:33.149
OF THE BILL AND THE NEED TO

01:02:33.216 --> 01:02:35.585
ADDRESS ISSUES IN THIS AREA. BUT

01:02:35.651 --> 01:02:38.821
I WAS ALSO STRUCK BY SOME OF THE

01:02:38.888 --> 01:02:40.923
OPPOSITION TESTIMONY. SO JUST A

01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:44.260
COUPLE FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS KIND

01:02:44.327 --> 01:02:46.095
OF ALONG THOSE LINES. HOW HOW

01:02:46.162 --> 01:02:48.164
WILL THIS PROGRAM INCLUDE

01:02:48.231 --> 01:02:51.100
COMMUNITY FEEDBACK TO ENSURE BUY

01:02:51.167 --> 01:02:53.636
IN FOR OPENING A NEW GROCERY

01:02:53.703 --> 01:02:58.341
STORE, I.E. POSSIBLE PROVISIONS

01:02:58.407 --> 01:03:00.009
THAT WOULD GIVE COMMUNITIES THE

01:03:00.076 --> 01:03:01.577
OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK

01:03:01.644 --> 01:03:04.380
ON WHAT TYPE OF GROCERY STORE OR

01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:05.815
PROVIDER THEY WANT IN THEIR

01:03:05.882 --> 01:03:08.317
COMMUNITY. RECOGNIZING THAT NOT

01:03:08.384 --> 01:03:10.119
EVERY COMMUNITY IS THE SAME AS

01:03:10.186 --> 01:03:12.989
WAS NOTED. WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I

01:03:13.055 --> 01:03:14.090
JUST REALLY WANT TO TAKE A

01:03:14.157 --> 01:03:15.858
MOMENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT ALL

01:03:15.925 --> 01:03:17.160
OF YOU SAID UP HERE, BECAUSE I

01:03:17.226 --> 01:03:19.195
THINK ULTIMATELY OUR GOAL IS THE

01:03:19.262 --> 01:03:20.329
SAME. AS ALREADY NOTED, I WORKED

01:03:20.396 --> 01:03:21.998
REALLY, REALLY HARD TO ENSURE

01:03:22.064 --> 01:03:23.900
THAT WE FEED OUR LOW INCOME

01:03:23.966 --> 01:03:25.168
COMMUNITIES. AS SOMEONE THAT

01:03:25.234 --> 01:03:28.871
GAVE OUT ALMOST 2000, YOU KNOW,

01:03:28.938 --> 01:03:30.640
FOOD BOXES LAST YEAR FOR

01:03:30.706 --> 01:03:31.841
THANKSGIVING, WE KNOW THAT THE

01:03:31.908 --> 01:03:34.577
NEED IS GREAT. AND SO I ALWAYS

01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:35.211
APPRECIATE MY PARTNERS AT THE

01:03:35.278 --> 01:03:36.779
FOOD BANKS WHO HELP OUT. IT IS

01:03:36.846 --> 01:03:39.215
SOMETHING THAT I THINK ALL OF US

01:03:39.282 --> 01:03:40.583
WANT TO MOVE TOWARDS, MAKING

01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:42.885
SURE THAT WE TACKLE THE FOOD

01:03:42.952 --> 01:03:44.620
INSECURITY ISSUE. I KNOW THAT

01:03:44.687 --> 01:03:46.923
THIS BILL IS MEANT TO PRIORITIZE

01:03:46.989 --> 01:03:49.358
TRIBAL COMMUNITIES, AS WELL AS

01:03:49.425 --> 01:03:51.561
THOSE ETHNIC, ETHNIC, SMALLER

01:03:51.627 --> 01:03:52.895
COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE THESE

01:03:52.962 --> 01:03:54.897
LITTLE SMALLER GROCERIES. I'M

01:03:54.964 --> 01:03:56.599
NOT OPPOSED TO HAVING A

01:03:56.666 --> 01:03:58.000
CONVERSATION OF HOW WE CAN MAYBE

01:03:58.067 --> 01:03:59.268
HELP THESE SMALLER GROCERY

01:03:59.335 --> 01:04:01.637
STORES PARTNER IN TERMS OF MAYBE

01:04:01.704 --> 01:04:03.072
SELLING SOME OTHER PRODUCTS TO,

01:04:03.139 --> 01:04:05.741
YOU KNOW, TO THESE LARGER COMING

01:04:05.808 --> 01:04:07.610
IN MARKETS SO THEY DON'T

01:04:07.677 --> 01:04:09.579
DISAPPEAR. BUT I HAVE TO SHARE

01:04:09.645 --> 01:04:10.913
WITH YOU, THIS BILL HAS BEEN

01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:12.715
AROUND SINCE LAST YEAR. AS I

01:04:12.782 --> 01:04:14.217
MENTIONED, IT PASSED ALMOST

01:04:14.283 --> 01:04:16.385
UNANIMOUSLY. IT HAS ALREADY. AND

01:04:16.452 --> 01:04:18.888
TO MY UFC FRIENDS, I JUST HEARD

01:04:18.955 --> 01:04:20.856
IN OPPOSITION, THIS IS THE FIRST

01:04:20.923 --> 01:04:22.158
TIME I HEAR HIM RIGHT HERE ON

01:04:22.225 --> 01:04:23.993
THE ON THE MICROPHONE, WHICH IS

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:24.560
REALLY DISAPPOINTING BECAUSE

01:04:24.627 --> 01:04:25.728
I'VE HAD A 20 YEAR RELATIONSHIP

01:04:25.795 --> 01:04:27.897
WITH THEM, 20 YEARS AS A LOCAL

01:04:27.964 --> 01:04:28.965
COUNCIL MEMBER, ALWAYS HELPING

01:04:29.031 --> 01:04:30.800
THEM BRING IN JOBS TO MY

01:04:30.866 --> 01:04:32.068
COMMUNITY. AND THIS IS NOT HOW

01:04:32.134 --> 01:04:34.370
WE NEGOTIATE. SO I HAVE TO SAY

01:04:34.437 --> 01:04:36.205
THAT HAVE WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY

01:04:36.272 --> 01:04:37.740
TO SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT IT,

01:04:37.807 --> 01:04:39.775
WE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE GOTTEN TO

01:04:39.842 --> 01:04:41.010
A PLACE WHERE THEY WOULDN'T BE

01:04:41.077 --> 01:04:42.545
HERE OPPOSING THE BILL. BUT I'M

01:04:42.612 --> 01:04:44.180
OPEN TO A CONVERSATION, AS I

01:04:44.247 --> 01:04:45.381
ALWAYS HAVE. THESE ARE IMPORTANT

01:04:45.448 --> 01:04:47.183
ISSUES TO ME AS WELL. LOW INCOME

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:49.585
COMMUNITY, PREDOMINANTLY LATINO.

01:04:49.652 --> 01:04:51.687
AND AS A TEACHER, I CAN TELL YOU,

01:04:51.754 --> 01:04:53.756
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I DID

01:04:53.823 --> 01:04:56.259
THAT I COULD ONLY DO IS WE HAVE

01:04:56.325 --> 01:04:57.460
KIDS THAT GO HOME BY THEMSELVES.

01:04:57.526 --> 01:04:58.861
AND AS A TEACHER, I REMEMBER

01:04:58.928 --> 01:04:59.595
LITERALLY TEACHING A COOKING

01:04:59.662 --> 01:05:01.130
CLASS WHERE WE COULD JUST CREATE

01:05:01.197 --> 01:05:03.232
HEALTHY OPTIONS WITH THREE

01:05:03.299 --> 01:05:04.567
INGREDIENTS AT HOME BECAUSE THEY

01:05:04.634 --> 01:05:06.035
WOULD GO HOME TO AN EMPTY HOME.

01:05:06.102 --> 01:05:08.170
AND WHAT DO WE DO? RIGHT. AND SO

01:05:08.237 --> 01:05:10.740
I'M VERY MINDFUL OF WHAT I DID

01:05:10.806 --> 01:05:11.807
FOR 20 YEARS AS A CLASSROOM

01:05:11.874 --> 01:05:13.476
TEACHER, MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN

01:05:13.542 --> 01:05:14.744
PICK UP ITEMS WHERE THE KIDS

01:05:14.810 --> 01:05:16.012
COULD GO HOME AND LITERALLY MAKE

01:05:16.078 --> 01:05:17.713
THEIR OWN FOOD WITH THREE

01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:18.781
INGREDIENTS THAT WERE HEALTHY.

01:05:18.848 --> 01:05:20.816
SO THIS IS A MISSION FOR ME

01:05:20.883 --> 01:05:21.984
THAT'S BEEN ONGOING, NOT JUST

01:05:22.051 --> 01:05:23.719
THE BILL THAT CAME IN TODAY, BUT

01:05:23.786 --> 01:05:24.854
IT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:26.922
CAN WORK TOWARDS WITHOUT

01:05:26.989 --> 01:05:28.324
OPPOSING EACH OTHER, BECAUSE I

01:05:28.391 --> 01:05:30.593
DO BELIEVE THAT IF WE SIT DOWN

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:32.595
AND HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS,

01:05:32.662 --> 01:05:34.497
YOU KNOW, WE HAVEN'T HAD

01:05:34.563 --> 01:05:36.632
OPPOSITION UNTIL, LIKE I SAID,

01:05:36.699 --> 01:05:38.334
UNTIL RECENTLY, WHICH IS REALLY

01:05:38.401 --> 01:05:39.935
DISAPPOINTING BECAUSE I WANT TO

01:05:40.002 --> 01:05:40.736
COLLABORATE. I WANT TO TALK

01:05:40.803 --> 01:05:42.071
ABOUT THESE ISSUES. I WANT TO

01:05:42.138 --> 01:05:45.007
MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THAT

01:05:45.074 --> 01:05:45.875
COMMUNITY FEEDBACK IN A WAY THAT

01:05:45.941 --> 01:05:47.810
MAKES EVERYONE HAPPY. SO I'M

01:05:47.877 --> 01:05:49.612
WE'LL CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION.

01:05:49.679 --> 01:05:50.713
AS I MENTIONED TODAY, I JUST

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.114
HEARD MY FRIENDS FROM UFW

01:05:52.181 --> 01:05:53.015
OPPOSED TODAY, AND THIS IS THE

01:05:53.082 --> 01:05:55.084
FIRST TIME I'VE HEARD OF IT. I'M

01:05:55.151 --> 01:05:56.819
WILLING TO SIT DOWN WITH EACH

01:05:56.886 --> 01:05:59.255
AND EVERY ONE OF YOU. I

01:05:59.322 --> 01:05:59.889
DEFINITELY DON'T WANT TO MAKE,

01:05:59.955 --> 01:06:01.223
YOU KNOW, BE PART OF MAKING SURE

01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:02.625
THAT WE DISAPPEAR. THE LAST TWO

01:06:02.692 --> 01:06:04.260
LITTLE GROCERY STORES IN OUR

01:06:04.327 --> 01:06:06.395
COMMUNITY, I WANT TO PARTNER. I

01:06:06.462 --> 01:06:07.763
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE BRING

01:06:07.830 --> 01:06:10.266
YOU TO THE TABLE. I WANT TO MAKE

01:06:10.333 --> 01:06:11.100
SURE THAT WE PUT SOME SAFEGUARDS

01:06:11.167 --> 01:06:12.635
IN PLACE. SO WE ARE PERHAPS,

01:06:12.702 --> 01:06:13.703
LIKE I SAID, PARTNERING TO

01:06:13.769 --> 01:06:15.171
ENSURE THAT WE BUY THEIR

01:06:15.237 --> 01:06:16.172
PRODUCTS, ESPECIALLY LOCALLY

01:06:16.238 --> 01:06:18.708
GROWN GROCERIES. SO ANYTHING

01:06:18.774 --> 01:06:20.309
THAT I CAN DO, PLEASE BE ASSURED

01:06:20.376 --> 01:06:22.812
THAT I WILL TRY TO COME TO THE

01:06:22.878 --> 01:06:24.080
TABLE. IF ANYONE'S OPEN FOR A

01:06:24.146 --> 01:06:26.048
CONVERSATION. I'M I'M STILL OPEN

01:06:26.115 --> 01:06:27.850
AND I APPRECIATE THAT. AND JUST

01:06:27.917 --> 01:06:29.719
A QUICK FOLLOW UP AND THANK YOU

01:06:29.785 --> 01:06:31.787
FOR MENTIONING LOCAL FARMERS

01:06:31.854 --> 01:06:35.024
MARKETS. WE KNOW A VALUABLE

01:06:35.091 --> 01:06:37.493
SOURCE OF AFFORDABILITY, HEALTHY

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:38.761
FOOD. SO I GUESS THE QUESTION

01:06:38.828 --> 01:06:42.398
IS, IS THERE COULD THERE BE SOME

01:06:42.465 --> 01:06:44.600
PLANNING TO TIE THIS NEW GRANT

01:06:44.667 --> 01:06:47.670
PROGRAM TO OTHER STRATEGIES TO

01:06:47.737 --> 01:06:50.039
REDUCE FOOD INSECURITY, LIKE

01:06:50.106 --> 01:06:51.340
CALFRESH AND MARKET MATCH, WHICH

01:06:51.407 --> 01:06:56.512
TIE INTO LOCAL MARKETS AND

01:06:56.579 --> 01:06:58.347
STOCKING SHELVES FROM LOCAL

01:06:58.414 --> 01:07:00.649
FARMERS AND RANCHERS? LIKE I

01:07:00.716 --> 01:07:02.251
SAID, EVERYTHING'S POSSIBLE.

01:07:02.318 --> 01:07:04.253
ABSOLUTELY. AND I ALSO WANT TO

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:05.921
NOTE THAT NOT EVERY COMMUNITY IS

01:07:05.988 --> 01:07:08.124
THE SAME. SO I GET THAT, YOU

01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:09.458
KNOW, I'VE BEEN TO WINTERS AND

01:07:09.525 --> 01:07:10.926
HAVE STOPPED AT YOUR LITTLE

01:07:10.993 --> 01:07:11.794
SUPERMARKET ON THE, YOU KNOW, ON

01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:13.929
THE ROAD. AND SO WE'LL

01:07:13.996 --> 01:07:14.864
DEFINITELY FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:16.799
I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY GUESTS,

01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:18.067
SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU WANT

01:07:18.134 --> 01:07:19.902
TO ADD TO THAT. ABSOLUTELY. SO I

01:07:19.969 --> 01:07:21.637
THINK THAT'S A WONDERFUL

01:07:21.704 --> 01:07:22.938
QUESTION. I WILL SAY, I THINK IN

01:07:23.005 --> 01:07:24.073
CFA'S HISTORIC PROGRAMS, THEY'VE

01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:25.141
ADDED ADDITIONAL POINTS. MANY OF

01:07:25.207 --> 01:07:26.709
YOU HAVE GONE THROUGH RFPS AND

01:07:26.776 --> 01:07:27.943
SEEN HOW EXTENSIVE THEY ARE.

01:07:28.010 --> 01:07:29.412
THEY'VE GOT SCORING RUBRICS.

01:07:29.478 --> 01:07:30.780
THEY THROUGH A ROBUST

01:07:30.846 --> 01:07:31.547
STAKEHOLDER PROCESS IN THE

01:07:31.614 --> 01:07:33.249
DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR RFP, PUT

01:07:33.315 --> 01:07:34.417
ADDITIONAL STANDARDS ON THE

01:07:34.483 --> 01:07:36.152
HEALTHY REFRIGERATION UNIT

01:07:36.218 --> 01:07:37.186
PROGRAM, ENCOURAGES AND GIVES

01:07:37.253 --> 01:07:38.721
EXTRA POINTS TO CORNER STORES

01:07:38.788 --> 01:07:40.489
THAT SOURCE FROM LOCAL FARMERS.

01:07:40.556 --> 01:07:42.925
WE WOULD IMAGINE THE SAME KIND

01:07:42.992 --> 01:07:44.393
OF LANGUAGE WOULD COME THROUGH

01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:45.227
ALONG WITH COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT.

01:07:45.294 --> 01:07:46.829
DO WE HAVE DECLARATIONS FROM

01:07:46.896 --> 01:07:48.531
MUNICIPALITIES? DO WE HAVE

01:07:48.597 --> 01:07:49.465
TRIBAL SUPPORT? HAVE WE DONE

01:07:49.532 --> 01:07:51.333
LISTENING SESSIONS THAT EACH

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:53.135
CITY AND EACH GROCERY PROJECT IS

01:07:53.202 --> 01:07:54.837
UNIQUE? THAT MAY NOT BE

01:07:54.904 --> 01:07:55.638
NECESSARY FOR A MARKET

01:07:55.704 --> 01:07:57.006
FEASIBILITY STUDY, BUT

01:07:57.072 --> 01:07:58.574
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY AS A PART

01:07:58.641 --> 01:08:00.409
OF SITING A GROCERY STORE. SO I

01:08:00.476 --> 01:08:01.744
THINK THERE'S AN ENTIRE PROCESS.

01:08:01.811 --> 01:08:02.912
SOVIET CAFE I UNDERSTAND IT'S

01:08:02.978 --> 01:08:04.613
NOT AS TRANSPARENT AS THE BILL

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:06.282
IN THE BILL, BUT THERE'S A LONG

01:08:06.348 --> 01:08:08.417
HISTORY THERE OF THAT KIND OF

01:08:08.484 --> 01:08:10.152
EQUITY AND SUCCESS THAT WE'D

01:08:10.219 --> 01:08:13.689
HOPE TO BUILD ON. ANY OTHER

01:08:13.756 --> 01:08:15.090
QUESTIONS ASSEMBLY MEMBER WE

01:08:15.157 --> 01:08:16.859
HAVE? I KNOW THAT WE HAVE

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:18.127
ASSEMBLYWOMAN RANSOM, AND THEN

01:08:18.194 --> 01:08:22.865
WE'LL GO TO ASSEMBLYWOMAN IRWIN.

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:24.767
OKAY. THANK YOU. SO I WANT TO

01:08:24.834 --> 01:08:27.303
THANK THE AUTHOR, AS WELL AS THE

01:08:27.369 --> 01:08:27.937
OPPOSITION FOR YOUR

01:08:28.003 --> 01:08:29.772
PRESENTATIONS TODAY. THIS BILL

01:08:29.839 --> 01:08:32.374
IS A LOT OF INTEREST TO ME IN MY

01:08:32.441 --> 01:08:33.843
DISTRICT. I LIVE IN A DISTRICT

01:08:33.909 --> 01:08:36.278
THAT HAS REALLY HIGH RATE OF

01:08:36.345 --> 01:08:37.880
POVERTY. FOLKS THAT DON'T HAVE

01:08:37.947 --> 01:08:39.582
ACCESS TO GROCERY STORES WHO

01:08:39.648 --> 01:08:41.050
LITERALLY ARE JUST VISITED A LOW

01:08:41.116 --> 01:08:42.418
INCOME HOUSING COMPLEX WHERE

01:08:42.485 --> 01:08:43.986
THEY GET THEIR GROCERIES.

01:08:44.053 --> 01:08:45.988
INSTACART, BECAUSE THERE IS NO

01:08:46.055 --> 01:08:47.756
LOCAL GROCERY STORE OPTION. AND

01:08:47.823 --> 01:08:51.160
SO MY QUESTION IN REGARDS TO,

01:08:51.227 --> 01:08:52.394
YOU KNOW, BASICALLY WHAT THE

01:08:52.461 --> 01:08:54.964
OPPOSITION HAS PRESENTED IS,

01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:57.233
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THE FACT

01:08:57.299 --> 01:08:58.667
THAT MAJOR GROCERY STORES, IF

01:08:58.734 --> 01:08:59.869
THEY WANTED TO BE IN THESE

01:08:59.935 --> 01:09:01.770
AREAS, WE WOULD NOT HAVE FOOD

01:09:01.837 --> 01:09:03.506
DESERTS. A LOT OF THEM HAVE

01:09:03.572 --> 01:09:05.040
ALREADY ABANDONED LOW INCOME

01:09:05.107 --> 01:09:06.842
COMMUNITIES. AND SO I'M

01:09:06.909 --> 01:09:08.210
WONDERING IF WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:09:08.277 --> 01:09:10.846
THIS AND ALSO LOOKING AT HOW

01:09:10.913 --> 01:09:11.914
THIS WORKS WITH THE FEDERAL

01:09:11.981 --> 01:09:14.483
PROGRAM, THE HFFI PROGRAM THAT

01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:15.784
HAS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT

01:09:15.851 --> 01:09:17.586
YOU ALREADY THAT YOU'RE

01:09:17.653 --> 01:09:18.721
CONCERNED ABOUT, ALREADY DROPPED

01:09:18.787 --> 01:09:20.556
IT IN THE WAY I'M LOOKING AT

01:09:20.623 --> 01:09:22.458
THIS BILL. THESE THINGS WOULD

01:09:22.525 --> 01:09:24.460
WORK TOGETHER. AND SO I'M

01:09:24.527 --> 01:09:25.561
WONDERING IF YOU'VE LOOKED AT

01:09:25.628 --> 01:09:29.532
HOW WE WOULD BE ABLE TO BE ABLE

01:09:29.598 --> 01:09:30.666
TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS, THE

01:09:30.733 --> 01:09:32.468
CONCERNS FOR THE FOOD

01:09:32.535 --> 01:09:33.402
INSECURITIES THAT WE'RE FACING

01:09:33.469 --> 01:09:35.170
WHEN THESE MAJOR GROCERY STORES,

01:09:35.237 --> 01:09:36.405
THEY ARE ABOUT MAKING THEIR

01:09:36.472 --> 01:09:37.806
DOLLARS AND THEY CAN'T MAKE

01:09:37.873 --> 01:09:39.975
THEIR DOLLARS, THEY'RE NOT GOING

01:09:40.042 --> 01:09:40.843
TO GO THERE. THAT'S HOW THEY

01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:41.844
OPERATE. SO I'M NOT REALLY

01:09:41.911 --> 01:09:42.811
CONCERNED ABOUT THEM COMING IN

01:09:42.878 --> 01:09:43.879
AND, YOU KNOW, BUYING OUT THESE

01:09:43.946 --> 01:09:45.714
GROCERY STORES WHERE THEY NEVER

01:09:45.781 --> 01:09:47.783
WANT IT TO BE ANYWAY. BECAUSE IN

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:48.551
MY COMMUNITY, THESE ARE LOW

01:09:48.617 --> 01:09:50.986
INCOME AREAS. SO IS THERE A WAY

01:09:51.053 --> 01:09:52.588
TO, YOU KNOW, WORK WITH YOU OR

01:09:52.655 --> 01:09:55.124
WORK WITH THE AUTHOR TO ENSURE

01:09:55.190 --> 01:09:58.060
THAT IF WE'RE LOOKING AT HDF5,

01:09:58.127 --> 01:10:00.129
WHICH IS THE HEALTHY FOOD

01:10:00.195 --> 01:10:01.530
FINANCING INITIATIVE, IT ALREADY

01:10:01.597 --> 01:10:02.698
ADDRESSES SOME OF THE CONCERNS

01:10:02.765 --> 01:10:05.167
THAT YOU HAVE IN REGARDS TO, YOU

01:10:05.234 --> 01:10:06.435
KNOW, PRIORITIZING THE THINGS

01:10:06.502 --> 01:10:08.070
THAT YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT. AND

01:10:08.137 --> 01:10:09.838
I REALLY IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU GUYS

01:10:09.905 --> 01:10:11.373
ALSO HAVE CONCERNED ABOUT MAKING

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:12.808
SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO

01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:14.843
FOOD, A FOOD BANK. I MEAN, WE

01:10:14.910 --> 01:10:15.778
SHOULDN'T HAVE PEOPLE HAVING TO

01:10:15.844 --> 01:10:18.380
LINE UP IN CARS AND GUESS WHAT

01:10:18.447 --> 01:10:19.615
THEY'RE GOING TO EAT FOR DINNER

01:10:19.682 --> 01:10:21.183
BASED ON WHAT WAS AVAILABLE FROM

01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:23.218
A FOOD BANK. AND THAT'S WHAT'S

01:10:23.285 --> 01:10:24.653
HAPPENING IN MY COMMUNITY. SO I,

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:26.789
I REALLY WANT TO BE ABLE TO SEE

01:10:26.855 --> 01:10:28.991
THIS BILL BE SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE

01:10:29.058 --> 01:10:31.894
WE NEED MORE. AND SO I, I DO

01:10:31.961 --> 01:10:33.128
UNDERSTAND BECAUSE I, WE HAVE A

01:10:33.195 --> 01:10:35.731
HUGE TRIBAL, YOU KNOW, COMMUNITY

01:10:35.798 --> 01:10:38.867
NETWORK IN MY COMMUNITY. AND WE

01:10:38.934 --> 01:10:40.569
JUST WE NEED MORE ACCESS TO

01:10:40.636 --> 01:10:42.371
FOOD. AND THAT'S WE NEED TO BE

01:10:42.438 --> 01:10:44.106
ON THE SAME PAGE IN REGARDS TO

01:10:44.173 --> 01:10:45.774
THAT. SO I AM SUPPORTING THIS

01:10:45.841 --> 01:10:47.676
BILL, BUT I WANT TO SEE THAT WE

01:10:47.743 --> 01:10:49.144
CAN ANSWER YOUR CONCERNS. AND I

01:10:49.211 --> 01:10:51.213
REALLY WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:52.615
UFW WHAT THEIR CONCERNS COULD

01:10:52.681 --> 01:10:54.083
POSSIBLY BE ABOUT PUTTING A

01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:55.784
GROCERY STORE IN A COMMUNITY

01:10:55.851 --> 01:10:56.986
WHERE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ACCESS

01:10:57.052 --> 01:10:59.188
TO FOOD. WE HAVE COLLEAGUES WHO

01:10:59.254 --> 01:11:00.589
HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE TRAVELING

01:11:00.656 --> 01:11:02.424
100 MILES TO GET GROCERIES, AND

01:11:02.491 --> 01:11:04.994
SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S

01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:06.562
ACCESS, AND SO CAN THE AUTHOR.

01:11:06.629 --> 01:11:08.831
CAN YOU ADDRESS WHETHER THIS

01:11:08.897 --> 01:11:11.667
PARTICULAR PROGRAM, HOW IT

01:11:11.734 --> 01:11:13.235
INTERSECTS WITH THE HDF5

01:11:13.302 --> 01:11:14.803
PROGRAM, THE FEDERAL PROGRAM?

01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:18.307
WILL THERE BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:11:18.374 --> 01:11:20.843
ENSURE THAT WE ARE PRIORITIZING

01:11:20.909 --> 01:11:22.711
WHETHER IT'S TRIBAL COMMUNITIES,

01:11:22.778 --> 01:11:25.214
WHETHER IT IS THE SMALL

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:26.148
NONPROFIT GROCERS? CAN YOU

01:11:26.215 --> 01:11:27.950
PLEASE HOW DO YOU INTEND THIS

01:11:28.017 --> 01:11:29.585
FOR THIS TO WORK TOGETHER?

01:11:29.652 --> 01:11:31.320
BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE IF I'M

01:11:31.387 --> 01:11:32.688
LOOKING AT THE BACKGROUND OF

01:11:32.755 --> 01:11:34.857
THIS, THAT THESE FOLKS WHO ARE

01:11:34.923 --> 01:11:36.025
STANDING UP THE GROCERY STORES

01:11:36.091 --> 01:11:38.027
WILL PROBABLY QUALIFY FOR BOTH

01:11:38.093 --> 01:11:39.261
PROGRAMS. BUT CAN YOU ADDRESS

01:11:39.328 --> 01:11:41.997
THAT FOR ME? YES. HAPPY TO, WITH

01:11:42.064 --> 01:11:44.166
THE CHAIR'S PERMISSION. SO IF

01:11:44.233 --> 01:11:47.403
THE FAIR PROGRAM THROUGH H H FFI

01:11:47.469 --> 01:11:49.405
WERE TO BE THE FUND SOURCE FOR

01:11:49.471 --> 01:11:50.339
THIS, CALIFORNIA WOULD BE

01:11:50.406 --> 01:11:50.973
BEHOLDEN TO MEETING THOSE

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:53.342
STANDARDS THAT ARE ALREADY IN

01:11:53.409 --> 01:11:54.243
THE HFFI RFP. THAT INCLUDES A

01:11:54.309 --> 01:11:56.812
BIPOC STANDARD THAT INCLUDES A

01:11:56.879 --> 01:11:58.914
TRIBAL COMPONENT THAT INCLUDES

01:11:58.981 --> 01:12:00.115
PRIORITIES FOR SMALL FARMS, OR,

01:12:00.182 --> 01:12:01.550
I'M SORRY, FOR SMALL GROCERY

01:12:01.617 --> 01:12:02.918
STORES. AND SO, BY EXTENSION,

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:04.687
THOSE REGULATIONS, IN ORDER FOR

01:12:04.753 --> 01:12:06.221
CALIFORNIA TO BE COMPETITIVE FOR

01:12:06.288 --> 01:12:07.856
THAT, THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE

01:12:07.923 --> 01:12:09.124
INCLUDING THAT IN THAT IN THEIR

01:12:09.191 --> 01:12:10.559
IN THEIR PROGRAM, IN THEIR RFP.

01:12:10.626 --> 01:12:12.194
IF THERE WAS A STANDALONE

01:12:12.261 --> 01:12:13.729
PROGRAM AT CDFA, WE'RE ASSUMING

01:12:13.796 --> 01:12:15.064
THAT SEVERAL OF THOSE COMPONENTS

01:12:15.130 --> 01:12:16.965
WOULD BE INCORPORATED WITH

01:12:17.032 --> 01:12:19.401
SPECIFIC DETAIL AS TO WHAT THE

01:12:19.468 --> 01:12:19.968
STAKEHOLDERS AND COMMUNITIES

01:12:20.035 --> 01:12:21.537
WOULD LIKE TO SEE THROUGH THE

01:12:21.603 --> 01:12:23.572
REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS PROCESS.

01:12:23.639 --> 01:12:25.274
SO THEY WOULD PUT OUT AN RFP AND

01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:26.975
INCLUDE ALL OF THOSE CONDITIONS.

01:12:27.042 --> 01:12:28.110
MANY OF THE FARM TO SCHOOL

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:29.578
PROGRAMS, MANY OF THE GRANT

01:12:29.645 --> 01:12:30.979
PROGRAMS THAT CDF HAS HAD, DON'T

01:12:31.046 --> 01:12:32.281
HAVE THOSE INDIVIDUAL LINE ITEMS

01:12:32.347 --> 01:12:34.283
WITH NECESSARY PRIORITIZATIONS

01:12:34.349 --> 01:12:36.151
ADDITIONAL POINTS FOR X, Y, AND

01:12:36.218 --> 01:12:37.853
Z. THAT'S A PART OF THE ROBUST

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:39.021
STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. SO WE WOULD

01:12:39.088 --> 01:12:40.723
IMAGINE THOSE SOME OF THOSE SAME

01:12:40.789 --> 01:12:43.292
COMPONENTS AT A SPECIFIC DEGREE

01:12:43.358 --> 01:12:45.027
OF, OF LEVEL OF DETAIL WOULD BE

01:12:45.094 --> 01:12:45.761
INCORPORATED THROUGH THAT

01:12:45.828 --> 01:12:47.863
PROCESS. THAT IS VERY NUANCED IN

01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:49.364
TRYING TO FIT THAT INTO A BILL.

01:12:49.431 --> 01:12:51.133
BUT IF IT WERE TO BE FEDERAL

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:52.901
DOLLARS, CALIFORNIA WOULD BE

01:12:52.968 --> 01:12:53.569
BEHOLDEN TO MEET THOSE

01:12:53.635 --> 01:12:54.403
STANDARDS. SO ANY FEDERAL

01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:56.105
DOLLARS WILL ALREADY HAVE THAT

01:12:56.171 --> 01:12:58.407
REQUIREMENT. AND ARE YOU OPPOSED

01:12:58.474 --> 01:13:02.277
TO, YOU KNOW, A PRIORITIZATION

01:13:02.344 --> 01:13:04.780
PROCESS WHERE WE CAN IF THE

01:13:04.847 --> 01:13:05.948
OPPORTUNITY PRESENTS ITSELF, WE

01:13:06.014 --> 01:13:07.750
DON'T WE DON'T HAVE A GUARANTEE

01:13:07.816 --> 01:13:09.485
THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A, YOU

01:13:09.551 --> 01:13:11.620
KNOW, THE HUGE INFLUX OF PEOPLE

01:13:11.687 --> 01:13:13.055
THAT CAN DO THAT. BUT ARE YOU

01:13:13.122 --> 01:13:14.523
OPPOSED TO WHEN THERE'S AN

01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:16.058
OPPORTUNITY, YOU KNOW, LOOKING

01:13:16.125 --> 01:13:18.827
AT THE OPPORTUNITY PROVIDE, YOU

01:13:18.894 --> 01:13:23.165
KNOW, THE TRIBAL OR BIPOC POINTS

01:13:23.232 --> 01:13:24.800
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE

01:13:24.867 --> 01:13:26.435
LOCAL GROCERY STORES

01:13:26.502 --> 01:13:28.904
OPPORTUNITIES ON BEHALF OF CGA.

01:13:28.971 --> 01:13:30.105
WE WOULD NOT BE OPPOSED TO

01:13:30.172 --> 01:13:32.608
HAVING THAT TO BE A PART OF THE

01:13:32.674 --> 01:13:33.575
RUBRIC THAT'S THERE. AT CDFA.

01:13:33.642 --> 01:13:35.144
WE'D ALSO WANT DETAILS OF WHAT

01:13:35.210 --> 01:13:36.845
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT LOOKS LIKE.

01:13:36.912 --> 01:13:38.847
WHAT DOES A COMMITMENT TO EXTEND

01:13:38.914 --> 01:13:40.849
ON THAT PROPERTY LOOK LIKE? SO

01:13:40.916 --> 01:13:42.117
WE'D WANT TO HAVE A LOT OF

01:13:42.184 --> 01:13:43.786
DETAIL THAT WOULD SUPPORT, I

01:13:43.852 --> 01:13:45.120
THINK, THE TENETS OF WHAT THE

01:13:45.187 --> 01:13:47.156
OPPOSITION IS ASKING FOR. WE

01:13:47.222 --> 01:13:47.756
JUST BELIEVE THOSE GUARDRAILS

01:13:47.823 --> 01:13:48.724
BELONG IN A REGULATORY PROCESS

01:13:48.791 --> 01:13:51.393
RATHER THAN IN EXPLICITLY STATED

01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:52.294
IN STATUTE. OKAY. THANK YOU,

01:13:52.361 --> 01:13:56.431
THANK YOU. NEXT, ASSEMBLYWOMAN

01:13:56.498 --> 01:13:58.834
ERWIN, THEN WE HAVE

01:13:58.901 --> 01:14:00.602
ASSEMBLYWOMAN HARDWICK AND

01:14:00.669 --> 01:14:05.541
ASSEMBLYMEMBER GONZALEZ. HI. I

01:14:05.607 --> 01:14:07.910
WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD TELL

01:14:07.976 --> 01:14:09.812
US HOW MANY GROCERY STORES HAVE

01:14:09.878 --> 01:14:12.414
CLOSED IN THE LAST LIKE TEN

01:14:12.481 --> 01:14:15.918
YEARS? YES, ACTUALLY WE CAN. SO

01:14:15.984 --> 01:14:18.253
IN CALIFORNIA, THE ECONOMIC

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:19.221
DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT, THERE'S

01:14:19.288 --> 01:14:20.589
A THERE'S A LAW CALLED THE WARN

01:14:20.656 --> 01:14:22.291
ACT, WHICH REQUIRES ANY GROCER,

01:14:22.357 --> 01:14:23.292
ACTUALLY ANY RETAILER THAT

01:14:23.358 --> 01:14:24.860
EMPLOYS OVER 100 PEOPLE. SO

01:14:24.927 --> 01:14:26.962
THOSE ARE MANY OF THE GROCERY

01:14:27.029 --> 01:14:28.163
STORES YOU'RE SPEAKING ABOUT

01:14:28.230 --> 01:14:28.997
HERE HAVE A REQUIREMENT TO

01:14:29.064 --> 01:14:30.432
NOTIFY LOCAL GOVERNMENT,

01:14:30.499 --> 01:14:31.366
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT

01:14:31.433 --> 01:14:32.467
AND OTHER STATE AGENCIES THAT

01:14:32.534 --> 01:14:33.602
THEY ARE PLANNING ON CLOSING.

01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:35.971
THEY HAVE TO GIVE A 60 DAY

01:14:36.038 --> 01:14:36.905
NOTICE. THEY HAVE TO MAKE SURE

01:14:36.972 --> 01:14:37.906
THAT THEY'RE MOVING THEIR

01:14:37.973 --> 01:14:39.808
EMPLOYEES TO NEARBY STORES AND

01:14:39.875 --> 01:14:40.309
MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE

01:14:40.375 --> 01:14:41.043
MAINTAINING A LEVEL OF

01:14:41.109 --> 01:14:41.844
EMPLOYMENT IF EVEN IF THEY'RE

01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:43.478
CLOSING JUST FOR MAKING

01:14:43.545 --> 01:14:44.379
RETROFITS ON THEIR FACILITIES,

01:14:44.446 --> 01:14:46.014
THEY HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE

01:14:46.081 --> 01:14:47.583
WARN ACT BASED ON ED DATA THAT

01:14:47.649 --> 01:14:49.518
WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST TEN

01:14:49.585 --> 01:14:51.253
YEARS, 15 GROCERY STORES THAT

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:53.088
EMPLOY 100 OR MORE PEOPLE HAVE

01:14:53.155 --> 01:14:54.857
CLOSED IN CALIFORNIA. TWO OF

01:14:54.923 --> 01:14:56.225
THOSE WERE FOR INTERIM CLOSURES

01:14:56.291 --> 01:14:58.827
TO DO UPDATES. TO GIVE THIS

01:14:58.894 --> 01:15:00.095
CONTEXT, THOSE 15 STORES

01:15:00.162 --> 01:15:04.166
REPRESENT 0.0101% OF ALL RETAIL

01:15:04.233 --> 01:15:05.601
CLOSURES IN THE STATE OF

01:15:05.667 --> 01:15:06.835
CALIFORNIA IN THE LAST TEN

01:15:06.902 --> 01:15:08.804
YEARS. SO I, I UNDERSTAND I

01:15:08.871 --> 01:15:09.671
THINK CJ UNDERSTANDS WE NEVER

01:15:09.738 --> 01:15:11.373
WANT TO SEE ANY GROCERY STORE

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:13.642
CLOSE REGARDLESS OF SIZE. BUT I

01:15:13.709 --> 01:15:15.077
THINK WE DO. WE ARE HOPING

01:15:15.143 --> 01:15:17.212
THROUGH THIS BILL TO BE ABLE TO

01:15:17.279 --> 01:15:17.846
ADDRESS THE OUTSTANDING PROBLEM

01:15:17.913 --> 01:15:19.348
OF HOW DO WE ENTICE GROCERY

01:15:19.414 --> 01:15:21.250
STORES TO GO IN PLACES THAT THEY

01:15:21.316 --> 01:15:22.718
WOULDN'T OTHERWISE GO? HOW CAN

01:15:22.784 --> 01:15:24.386
WE HELP THEM INCENTIVIZE

01:15:24.453 --> 01:15:25.787
RETROFITS SO THEY CAN OFFER MORE

01:15:25.854 --> 01:15:27.222
FRESH, LOCAL OFFERINGS THAN THEY

01:15:27.289 --> 01:15:28.757
WOULD OTHERWISE BE OFFERING AND

01:15:28.824 --> 01:15:30.492
MEET WITH THE CULTURE OF THEIR

01:15:30.559 --> 01:15:32.027
COMMUNITY? SO OUR HOPE IS THAT

01:15:32.094 --> 01:15:33.061
THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM IS FILLING

01:15:33.128 --> 01:15:36.398
THE GAP, THOUGH WE THINK IT'S A

01:15:36.465 --> 01:15:37.766
IT'S A NARROW GAP IN THE LARGER

01:15:37.833 --> 01:15:38.800
SUBSET, BUT CERTAINLY SMALLER

01:15:38.867 --> 01:15:39.868
FORMAT. GROCERY STORES NEED AN

01:15:39.935 --> 01:15:41.503
OPPORTUNITY TO THRIVE AS WELL.

01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:42.938
OKAY. THANK YOU. I WAS TRYING TO

01:15:43.005 --> 01:15:44.806
FIND THE DATA IN MY DISTRICT

01:15:44.873 --> 01:15:46.775
BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF

01:15:46.842 --> 01:15:48.410
GROCERY STORES CLOSE. I HAVE 11

01:15:48.477 --> 01:15:49.344
COUNTIES VERY RURAL. OUR GROCERY

01:15:49.411 --> 01:15:51.546
STORES ARE KIND OF THE HUB OF

01:15:51.613 --> 01:15:53.081
THE TOWN, AND I'M THE COLLEAGUE

01:15:53.148 --> 01:15:54.449
THAT HAS TO DRIVE 100 MILES TO

01:15:54.516 --> 01:15:56.051
GET TO A WALMART. SO IT'S THREE

01:15:56.118 --> 01:15:57.920
HOURS TO A COSTCO. LIKE I LIVE

01:15:57.986 --> 01:16:00.389
IN MODOC COUNTY IN ALTURAS. IT'S

01:16:00.455 --> 01:16:03.125
VERY, VERY RURAL. OUR OUR

01:16:03.191 --> 01:16:04.726
GROCERY STORE. WE ARE VERY

01:16:04.793 --> 01:16:06.528
BLESSED. IT'S A LARGER CHAIN,

01:16:06.595 --> 01:16:08.297
BUT THEY SELL LOCAL PRODUCTS.

01:16:08.363 --> 01:16:09.765
THEY GET STUFF FROM LOCAL

01:16:09.831 --> 01:16:12.000
FARMERS, LOCAL HONEY, FLOUR. WE

01:16:12.067 --> 01:16:14.403
HAVE A FLOUR MILL DOWN THE ROAD.

01:16:14.469 --> 01:16:15.671
THE TRIBE THERE HAS BEEN REALLY

01:16:15.737 --> 01:16:16.939
FOCUSED ON FOOD SOVEREIGNTY AND

01:16:17.005 --> 01:16:18.740
IS WORKING WITH THEM, PARTNERED

01:16:18.807 --> 01:16:19.975
WITH THEM, THAT THEY WOULD

01:16:20.042 --> 01:16:21.043
HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO SELL THAT

01:16:21.109 --> 01:16:23.412
AS SOON AS THEY GET UP AND

01:16:23.478 --> 01:16:25.147
GOING. I, I AM A PROUD CO AUTHOR

01:16:25.213 --> 01:16:27.015
OF THIS BILL. I THINK THIS IS A

01:16:27.082 --> 01:16:29.217
HUGE NEED IN MY DISTRICT. THE

01:16:29.284 --> 01:16:31.320
NORTH STATE IS STRUGGLING AND WE

01:16:31.386 --> 01:16:32.821
HAVE MADE IT SO HARD TO RUN A

01:16:32.888 --> 01:16:34.890
BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA THAT ANY

01:16:34.957 --> 01:16:36.792
INCENTIVE THAT WE HAVE,

01:16:36.858 --> 01:16:39.361
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO

01:16:39.428 --> 01:16:41.463
ACCESS FOR JUST FOOD. I WAS ALSO

01:16:41.530 --> 01:16:43.265
A CLASSROOM TEACHER AND I'M A

01:16:43.332 --> 01:16:45.434
FARMER. LIKE, IT'S AMAZING HOW

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:47.569
MANY OF OUR KIDS ARE GOING HOME

01:16:47.636 --> 01:16:50.138
HUNGRY. AND AS GAS PRICES RISE,

01:16:50.205 --> 01:16:52.674
THAT KILLS MY THAT KILLS MY

01:16:52.741 --> 01:16:54.609
FAMILIES. THEY ARE HAVING TO,

01:16:54.676 --> 01:16:56.812
YOU KNOW, A TRIP TO TOWN. WE

01:16:56.878 --> 01:16:57.879
CALL IT TOWN WHEN WE DRIVE 100

01:16:57.946 --> 01:16:59.815
MILES TO GO TO WALMART OR

01:16:59.881 --> 01:17:01.149
WHATEVER STORE WE'RE GOING TO,

01:17:01.216 --> 01:17:02.718
YOU KNOW, THAT'S THAT'S NO

01:17:02.784 --> 01:17:05.187
LONGER A $20 TANK OF GAS. THAT'S

01:17:05.253 --> 01:17:08.023
60, $70 FOR TO ADD ON TO YOUR

01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:11.326
GROCERY BILL. WE HAVE TO MAKE IT

01:17:11.393 --> 01:17:12.728
MORE ACCESSIBLE. I WISH I HAD

01:17:12.794 --> 01:17:14.930
INSTANT, I HAVE NEVER DONE

01:17:14.997 --> 01:17:17.065
INSTACART. I'M MIGHT HAVE TO TRY

01:17:17.132 --> 01:17:20.002
THAT. WE DON'T HAVE ANY OF THAT

01:17:20.068 --> 01:17:21.503
STUFF. YOU KNOW WHERE WE LIVE.

01:17:21.570 --> 01:17:23.705
WE'RE INSTA INSTA SORRY, INSTA.

01:17:23.772 --> 01:17:25.807
WE DON'T HAVE THAT WHERE I LIVE.

01:17:25.874 --> 01:17:28.844
SO, YOU KNOW, THAT'S A

01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:30.712
CONVENIENCE THAT RURAL RURAL

01:17:30.779 --> 01:17:34.049
LIVING DOESN'T OFFER US. SO I

01:17:34.116 --> 01:17:36.151
COMPLETELY HEAR THE WORRIES OF

01:17:36.218 --> 01:17:36.952
THE OPPOSITION. AND I'M JUST

01:17:37.019 --> 01:17:40.155
GOING TO HOPE THAT THESE GROCERY

01:17:40.222 --> 01:17:42.391
STORES THAT ARE THE HUBS OF

01:17:42.457 --> 01:17:43.725
THEIR COMMUNITIES IN IN MY

01:17:43.792 --> 01:17:44.926
DISTRICT, THEY'RE THE ONES

01:17:44.993 --> 01:17:45.827
SPONSORING THE LITTLE LEAGUE

01:17:45.894 --> 01:17:46.962
TEAMS. THEY'RE THE ONES, YOU

01:17:47.029 --> 01:17:49.431
KNOW, DONATING FOOD FOR EVERY

01:17:49.498 --> 01:17:51.266
BOOSTERS EVENT OR PTA MEETING

01:17:51.333 --> 01:17:53.735
OR, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE THEY

01:17:53.802 --> 01:17:55.637
REALLY ARE THE HUBS OF THESE

01:17:55.704 --> 01:17:57.539
COMMUNITIES. AND I DO FEEL LIKE

01:17:57.606 --> 01:17:59.074
THEY HAVE THAT COMMUNITY

01:17:59.141 --> 01:18:01.743
FEEDBACK BECAUSE THEY ARE SO

01:18:01.810 --> 01:18:02.944
INVOLVED AND THEY THEY NEED EACH

01:18:03.011 --> 01:18:05.080
OTHER. IT'S A, YOU KNOW, IT'S A

01:18:05.147 --> 01:18:08.517
WIN WIN FOR EVERYBODY. BUT I, I,

01:18:08.583 --> 01:18:10.052
I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR

01:18:10.118 --> 01:18:12.521
FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. AND I

01:18:12.587 --> 01:18:13.955
HOPE, I'M SURE THAT YOU WILL

01:18:14.022 --> 01:18:15.424
CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WITH

01:18:15.490 --> 01:18:18.927
THE OPPOSITION AND HAPPY TO

01:18:18.994 --> 01:18:20.829
SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. THANK

01:18:20.896 --> 01:18:24.266
YOU. CHAIR GONZALEZ. THANK YOU,

01:18:24.332 --> 01:18:29.104
MADAM CHAIR. FROM MODOC TO

01:18:29.171 --> 01:18:32.174
IMPERIAL ALL THE WAY DOWN SOUTH,

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:35.977
I REPRESENT A AREA THAT IS THAT

01:18:36.044 --> 01:18:38.613
HAS 12 SOVEREIGN NATIONS, AND

01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:40.515
IT'S ABOUT THE SIZE A LITTLE BIT

01:18:40.582 --> 01:18:42.918
BIGGER THAN NEW HAMPSHIRE. SO

01:18:42.984 --> 01:18:45.687
IT'S A PRETTY BIG PERMISSION TO

01:18:45.754 --> 01:18:51.760
USE A PROP. THAT WOULD BE NICE.

01:18:51.827 --> 01:18:56.031
SO THE GREEN IS LOW INCOME, LOW

01:18:56.098 --> 01:18:57.933
ACCESS. SO AS YOU CAN SEE JUST

01:18:57.999 --> 01:19:01.803
BY THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF NEED, A

01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:07.175
LOT OF DESERT TO COVER. IT IS WE

01:19:07.242 --> 01:19:09.411
ALSO HAVE A 17% UNEMPLOYMENT

01:19:09.478 --> 01:19:15.684
RATE. A PLACE LIKE BLYTHE HAS NO

01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:18.787
GROCERY STORES. AND THAT'S A

01:19:18.854 --> 01:19:22.757
THAT'S A HUGE CHALLENGE, RIGHT?

01:19:22.824 --> 01:19:24.793
UNEMPLOYMENT, NO GROCERY STORE.

01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:25.961
LIKE THERE'S JUST A LOT OF

01:19:26.027 --> 01:19:27.696
THINGS GOING ON OVER THERE. AND

01:19:27.762 --> 01:19:29.297
1 IN 4 KIDS DON'T KNOW WHERE

01:19:29.364 --> 01:19:31.633
THEIR NEXT MEAL IS COMING FROM.

01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:34.302
SO THAT IN ITSELF IS A

01:19:34.369 --> 01:19:36.705
CHALLENGE. I HAVE A COUPLE

01:19:36.771 --> 01:19:40.275
QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR OR

01:19:40.342 --> 01:19:43.979
TECHNICAL QUESTION HERE. HOW

01:19:44.045 --> 01:19:45.847
WOULD THESE WELL, FIRST OF ALL,

01:19:45.914 --> 01:19:49.718
LET ME CLARIFY FOR CLARITY. CAN

01:19:49.784 --> 01:19:52.487
A SMALL GROCERY STORE GET THIS

01:19:52.554 --> 01:19:56.158
GRANT? ABSOLUTELY. GREAT. SO NOT

01:19:56.224 --> 01:19:59.161
JUST BIG. THIS IS SMALL. THIS IS

01:19:59.227 --> 01:20:00.629
ANYONE. AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO

01:20:00.695 --> 01:20:02.464
CLARIFY, THE BILL SETS ASIDE 10%

01:20:02.531 --> 01:20:04.332
OF ANY MONEY THAT THE STATE

01:20:04.399 --> 01:20:05.066
RECEIVES IN ORDER TO PROVIDE

01:20:05.133 --> 01:20:06.968
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THAT'S THE

01:20:07.035 --> 01:20:07.536
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT A

01:20:07.602 --> 01:20:09.504
SMALL GROCER NEEDS TO FIGURE

01:20:09.571 --> 01:20:11.806
OUT, PERMITTING, PLANNING WHO TO

01:20:11.873 --> 01:20:13.575
CONTRACT WITH ON SITE

01:20:13.642 --> 01:20:15.243
EVALUATIONS. SO, FOR INSTANCE,

01:20:15.310 --> 01:20:17.679
THE CITY OF BLYTHE, THEY DON'T

01:20:17.746 --> 01:20:19.548
HAVE ANYTHING. SOMEONE SAYS,

01:20:19.614 --> 01:20:22.050
HEY, YOU KNOW, RONNIE, ROBBY,

01:20:22.117 --> 01:20:27.789
RICKY AND MIKE. NEW ADDITION.

01:20:27.856 --> 01:20:31.226
YEAH, WE ALL KNOW THEM. YOU WANT

01:20:31.293 --> 01:20:33.728
TO PUT A GROCERY STORE TOGETHER?

01:20:33.795 --> 01:20:35.130
IS THIS SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN

01:20:35.197 --> 01:20:38.667
HAVE ACCESS TO? OKAY, GREAT. HOW

01:20:38.733 --> 01:20:41.536
WOULD THE AS THE BILL IS

01:20:41.603 --> 01:20:43.738
CURRENTLY WRITTEN, IS CDFA ABLE

01:20:43.805 --> 01:20:45.106
TO DECIDE WHO IS AWARDED THE

01:20:45.173 --> 01:20:47.209
GRANT MONEY? I THINK YOU ALREADY

01:20:47.275 --> 01:20:49.744
ANSWERED THAT. SO, YES. SO IT

01:20:49.811 --> 01:20:51.479
IT'S NOT JUST THIS BLANKET

01:20:51.546 --> 01:20:56.618
COVERAGE. OKAY, GREAT. AS A

01:20:56.685 --> 01:20:58.853
PRINCIPAL COAUTHOR AND SOMEONE

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:02.090
WHO REPRESENTS AN AREA THAT'S

01:21:02.157 --> 01:21:03.592
SIGNIFICANTLY IN NEED, I'M

01:21:03.658 --> 01:21:05.060
THANKFUL NOT ONLY FOR THE AUTHOR

01:21:05.126 --> 01:21:09.864
AND YOUR CONSISTENT.

01:21:09.931 --> 01:21:12.167
COMPASSIONATE LOOK IN INTO

01:21:12.234 --> 01:21:13.168
COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE AND

01:21:13.235 --> 01:21:14.803
COMMUNITIES LIKE YOURS. I'M

01:21:14.869 --> 01:21:16.571
THANKFUL FOR THE GROCERS WHO

01:21:16.638 --> 01:21:18.406
I'VE BEEN IN LOTS OF

01:21:18.473 --> 01:21:19.841
CONVERSATIONS WITH ABOUT HOW DO

01:21:19.908 --> 01:21:22.310
WE JUST ANSWER THIS NEED AND HOW

01:21:22.377 --> 01:21:24.946
DO WE WORK TOGETHER. AND HUNGER

01:21:25.013 --> 01:21:27.449
IS NOT A PARTIZAN ISSUE, RIGHT?

01:21:27.515 --> 01:21:29.784
IT IS. IT IS. ABSOLUTELY. IT'S A

01:21:29.851 --> 01:21:31.920
HUMAN ISSUE. AND I'M THANKFUL

01:21:31.987 --> 01:21:33.355
THAT THAT THE AUTHOR HAS BROUGHT

01:21:33.421 --> 01:21:36.992
THIS UP. AND IT'S FOR THOSE

01:21:37.058 --> 01:21:38.360
REASONS IN YOUR LEADERSHIP THAT

01:21:38.426 --> 01:21:40.061
I'LL BE SUPPORTING TODAY. THANK

01:21:40.128 --> 01:21:43.164
YOU. GREAT. THANK YOU. I THINK

01:21:43.231 --> 01:21:44.532
ASSEMBLYWOMAN RANSOM HAS ANOTHER

01:21:44.599 --> 01:21:45.767
COMMENT OR QUESTION. IT WAS A

01:21:45.834 --> 01:21:47.669
QUICK QUESTION THAT I FORGOT TO

01:21:47.736 --> 01:21:49.537
ASK. SO WITH THIS PROGRAM, WILL

01:21:49.604 --> 01:21:52.107
THERE BE REQUIREMENTS FOR IF YOU

01:21:52.173 --> 01:21:53.608
ARE SUCCESSFUL IN THE GRANT, HOW

01:21:53.675 --> 01:21:57.112
LONG YOUR STORE MUST BE OPEN AND

01:21:57.178 --> 01:21:59.381
IN THIS COMMUNITY. OTHERWISE YOU

01:21:59.447 --> 01:22:01.082
MIGHT HAVE TO REFUND SOME OF THE

01:22:01.149 --> 01:22:02.517
GRANT MONEY. WILL THAT BE

01:22:02.584 --> 01:22:04.219
BECAUSE THAT WAS A CONCERN THAT

01:22:04.286 --> 01:22:06.087
WAS RAISED TO MY OFFICE? IS THAT

01:22:06.154 --> 01:22:07.622
SOMETHING THAT'S A REQUIREMENT?

01:22:07.689 --> 01:22:08.723
ABSOLUTELY. IT'S NOT EXPLICIT IN

01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:11.159
THE BILL AS WE'VE STATED, BUT

01:22:11.226 --> 01:22:12.727
CDFA WITH THEIR HISTORICAL

01:22:12.794 --> 01:22:15.497
PROGRAMS HAVE REQUIRED, LIKE FOR

01:22:15.563 --> 01:22:16.765
CORNER STORES, THEY HAVE OR I'M

01:22:16.831 --> 01:22:18.667
SORRY, FOR THEIR FARM TO SCHOOL

01:22:18.733 --> 01:22:19.668
PROGRAM. THEY HAVE TO HAVE A

01:22:19.734 --> 01:22:20.835
LETTER OF SUPPORT FROM THE

01:22:20.902 --> 01:22:22.837
SCHOOL THAT THAT SCHOOL IS

01:22:22.904 --> 01:22:23.838
WILLING TO COMMIT TO PURCHASING

01:22:23.905 --> 01:22:25.040
THAT PRODUCT FOR A PARTICULAR

01:22:25.106 --> 01:22:27.776
AMOUNT OF TIME, FOR SOME OF THE

01:22:27.842 --> 01:22:28.476
ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THAT

01:22:28.543 --> 01:22:30.512
COMMITMENT. THERE'S A LOT MORE

01:22:30.578 --> 01:22:32.147
THAT GOES INTO BUILDING A

01:22:32.213 --> 01:22:33.248
GROCERY STORE THAN JUST GETTING

01:22:33.315 --> 01:22:34.716
DOLLARS FROM THE STATE. IT'S

01:22:34.783 --> 01:22:35.784
INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE PROCESS.

01:22:35.850 --> 01:22:37.485
THEY NEED MATCHING DOLLARS.

01:22:37.552 --> 01:22:39.287
THEY'VE GOT CONSUMER INTEREST

01:22:39.354 --> 01:22:41.022
SURVEYS, THEY'VE GOT COMPANY

01:22:41.089 --> 01:22:42.290
PERSPECTIVES AND MARKET DATA

01:22:42.357 --> 01:22:43.758
THAT WOULD LIKELY BE SUBMITTED

01:22:43.825 --> 01:22:45.627
TO THE DEPARTMENT IN ORDER FOR

01:22:45.694 --> 01:22:47.996
THEM TO MAKE A DECISION ON

01:22:48.063 --> 01:22:48.663
WHETHER THE DEPARTMENT BELIEVES,

01:22:48.730 --> 01:22:49.798
BASED ON A RUBRIC, THAT THEY

01:22:49.864 --> 01:22:50.699
WOULD DEVELOP WITH COMMUNITY

01:22:50.765 --> 01:22:52.600
INPUT. IS THIS THE BEST BANG FOR

01:22:52.667 --> 01:22:53.768
THE BUCK? IS THIS THE MOST

01:22:53.835 --> 01:22:55.770
EFFICIENT USE OF THE RESOURCES?

01:22:55.837 --> 01:22:57.472
THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE THE

01:22:57.539 --> 01:22:59.441
PANACEA TO FIXING HUNGER. I KNOW

01:22:59.507 --> 01:23:00.709
THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE

01:23:00.775 --> 01:23:02.510
PANACEA TO FIX ACCESS. WE KNOW

01:23:02.577 --> 01:23:03.912
THAT. BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS

01:23:03.978 --> 01:23:05.146
THAT IF THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY

01:23:05.213 --> 01:23:06.981
TO CAPITALIZE ON DOLLARS THAT

01:23:07.048 --> 01:23:07.849
MAY BE AVAILABLE IN ORDER TO

01:23:07.916 --> 01:23:10.185
FILL THE VERY WIDE GAPS IN A

01:23:10.251 --> 01:23:11.586
LIMITED CAPACITY THAT WE CAN,

01:23:11.653 --> 01:23:13.488
THAT'S WHAT WE WOULD DO. AND I

01:23:13.555 --> 01:23:15.090
THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF FAITH

01:23:15.156 --> 01:23:16.624
THAT THE DEPARTMENT AND THROUGH

01:23:16.691 --> 01:23:17.258
A STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK PROCESS

01:23:17.325 --> 01:23:19.027
WOULD BE ABLE TO ADD THOSE

01:23:19.094 --> 01:23:20.228
TENDRILS AND THOSE GUARDRAILS IN

01:23:20.295 --> 01:23:21.696
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE

01:23:21.763 --> 01:23:22.997
SPENDING THE MONEY APPROPRIATELY

01:23:23.064 --> 01:23:29.404
AND JUDICIOUSLY. THANK YOU.

01:23:29.471 --> 01:23:30.805
ASSEMBLYMAN OR MY VICE CHAIR,

01:23:30.872 --> 01:23:33.508
ALANIS. THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR.

01:23:33.575 --> 01:23:36.077
I THINK THIS BILL IS GREAT. I'M

01:23:36.144 --> 01:23:37.979
JUST IT JUST KEEPS IRKING ME

01:23:38.046 --> 01:23:39.748
WITH THE OPPOSITION. WHAT IF YOU

01:23:39.814 --> 01:23:42.283
GUYS CAN ANSWER THIS QUESTION?

01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:44.386
WHY DID WE WAIT SO LONG? I'M

01:23:44.452 --> 01:23:46.187
SORRY. WHY DID WE WAIT SO LONG

01:23:46.254 --> 01:23:47.355
TO DO THE OPPOSITION LETTERS

01:23:47.422 --> 01:23:50.658
THAT YOU GUYS DID? SURE. MAY I

01:23:50.725 --> 01:23:51.826
PERSON. GREAT. THANK YOU. MY

01:23:51.893 --> 01:23:53.128
NAME IS BETH SMOKER. I'M THE

01:23:53.194 --> 01:23:54.195
POLICY DIRECTOR AT THE

01:23:54.262 --> 01:23:55.397
CALIFORNIA FOOD AND FARMING

01:23:55.463 --> 01:23:57.632
NETWORK. WE ACTUALLY SHARED A

01:23:57.699 --> 01:23:59.501
LETTER OF CONCERN WITH SENATOR

01:23:59.567 --> 01:24:01.236
RUBIO BACK IN APRIL, BEFORE IT

01:24:01.302 --> 01:24:03.171
EVER WENT TO ITS FIRST POLICY

01:24:03.238 --> 01:24:05.006
COMMITTEE, AND MET WITH TWO OF

01:24:05.073 --> 01:24:06.141
YOUR STAFF MULTIPLE TIMES AND

01:24:06.207 --> 01:24:08.076
SHARED OUR CONCERNS AGAIN,

01:24:08.143 --> 01:24:09.244
REALLY TRYING NOT TO TAKE AN

01:24:09.310 --> 01:24:10.678
OPPOSITIONAL POSITION BECAUSE WE

01:24:10.745 --> 01:24:13.615
AGREE WITH THE INTENT.

01:24:13.681 --> 01:24:16.384
UNFORTUNATELY, OUR REQUESTS WERE

01:24:16.451 --> 01:24:18.186
IGNORED. AND SO WE TURNED TO A

01:24:18.253 --> 01:24:21.256
LETTER OF OPPOSITION BACK RIGHT

01:24:21.322 --> 01:24:23.258
AFTER IT PASSED APPROPRIATIONS

01:24:23.324 --> 01:24:25.760
IN THE SENATE AND HAVE MET WITH

01:24:25.827 --> 01:24:27.095
YOUR OFFICE MULTIPLE TIMES,

01:24:27.162 --> 01:24:28.963
INCLUDING AGAIN THIS MORNING,

01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:31.966
AND GOT AN EMAIL CONFIRMING THAT

01:24:32.033 --> 01:24:34.769
THERE WAS NO WILLINGNESS TO TAKE

01:24:34.836 --> 01:24:37.705
ANY OF OUR AMENDMENTS. OKAY.

01:24:37.772 --> 01:24:40.742
THANK YOU. AND ALSO JUST.

01:24:40.809 --> 01:24:42.777
TAYLOR, IF YOU CAN ANSWER THIS,

01:24:42.844 --> 01:24:44.646
I KNOW ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE

01:24:44.712 --> 01:24:46.614
BROUGHT UP A POPULATION AS FAR

01:24:46.681 --> 01:24:48.950
AS WITH STORES IS, AND IT GOT ME

01:24:49.017 --> 01:24:50.485
THINKING ON THAT ALSO IS THERE

01:24:50.552 --> 01:24:51.786
DOES THIS BILL HELP WITH THAT AS

01:24:51.853 --> 01:24:53.521
WELL? IF WE CAN'T GET THE

01:24:53.588 --> 01:24:54.823
POPULATION THERE, HOW WOULD THIS

01:24:54.889 --> 01:24:56.825
BILL HELP WITH THAT? YEAH, I

01:24:56.891 --> 01:24:59.093
MEAN I THINK WE ALL I'M GOING TO

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:00.428
SPEAK PLAINLY, I THINK WE ALL

01:25:00.495 --> 01:25:01.496
KNOW LARGER SCALE BUSINESSES

01:25:01.563 --> 01:25:03.231
MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON A LOT OF

01:25:03.298 --> 01:25:04.332
DIFFERENT FACTORS. WHAT WE NEED

01:25:04.399 --> 01:25:06.468
IS THE INCENTIVE FOR THOSE THAT

01:25:06.534 --> 01:25:07.535
HAVEN'T ALREADY DONE THE MARKET

01:25:07.602 --> 01:25:08.570
RESEARCH, THAT DON'T HAVE THE

01:25:08.636 --> 01:25:09.871
INTERNAL CAPACITY TO DO THAT

01:25:09.938 --> 01:25:11.706
KIND OF WORK. WE NEED TO HELP

01:25:11.773 --> 01:25:14.142
THEM DO THAT WORK SO THAT THEY

01:25:14.209 --> 01:25:15.477
CAN COME IN WHERE OTHERS HAVE

01:25:15.543 --> 01:25:16.144
CHOSEN, FOR WHATEVER REASON, NOT

01:25:16.211 --> 01:25:18.079
TO. SO OUR HOPE IS THAT THIS

01:25:18.146 --> 01:25:20.081
PROGRAM IS A WAY TO FILL THOSE

01:25:20.148 --> 01:25:22.317
GAPS WHERE THERE HASN'T BEEN AN

01:25:22.383 --> 01:25:23.785
APPETITE IN THE PAST, OR AT

01:25:23.852 --> 01:25:25.520
LEAST ALLOW THOSE GROCERY STORES

01:25:25.587 --> 01:25:27.021
THAT DON'T HAVE THE INTERNAL

01:25:27.088 --> 01:25:28.823
CAPACITY TO DO THAT, TO

01:25:28.890 --> 01:25:29.991
ACTUALIZE AND REALIZE THEIR

01:25:30.058 --> 01:25:31.626
FUTURE WITH AN OPPORTUNITY IN

01:25:31.693 --> 01:25:32.594
THAT PARTICULAR COMMUNITY THAT

01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:35.230
ISN'T ALREADY SERVED. THANK YOU.

01:25:35.296 --> 01:25:37.031
I'M GOOD. SURE. GREAT. THANK

01:25:37.098 --> 01:25:38.867
YOU. I APPRECIATE ALL THE

01:25:38.933 --> 01:25:39.934
COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS. I JUST

01:25:40.001 --> 01:25:42.637
HAVE SOME FINAL QUESTIONS. AND,

01:25:42.704 --> 01:25:44.372
YOU KNOW, JUST A COUPLE THOUGHTS

01:25:44.439 --> 01:25:46.508
TODAY. I THINK YOU'VE ANSWERED A

01:25:46.574 --> 01:25:48.543
LOT OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAD.

01:25:48.610 --> 01:25:49.644
I OBVIOUSLY REPRESENT ALSO VERY

01:25:49.711 --> 01:25:52.146
RURAL DISTRICT, EVEN THOUGH I

01:25:52.213 --> 01:25:54.415
LIKE TO SAY THAT WE ARE THE

01:25:54.482 --> 01:25:56.351
BREADBASKET OF THE STATE AND,

01:25:56.417 --> 01:25:58.353
YOU KNOW, THE NATION, WE STILL

01:25:58.419 --> 01:26:00.388
HAVE A LOT OF CHILDREN THAT ARE

01:26:00.455 --> 01:26:02.557
FOOD INSECURE FAMILIES THAT ARE

01:26:02.624 --> 01:26:04.759
LIVING IN, YOU KNOW, FOOD

01:26:04.826 --> 01:26:06.594
INSECURE. AND SO THIS IS AN

01:26:06.661 --> 01:26:07.962
ISSUE THAT IS IMPORTANT TO ME.

01:26:08.029 --> 01:26:09.964
AND I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THE INTENT

01:26:10.031 --> 01:26:11.966
OF THE BILL. I DO WANT TO FIGURE

01:26:12.033 --> 01:26:13.968
OUT HOW WE DO STRIKE A BALANCE

01:26:14.035 --> 01:26:16.070
IN TERMS OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

01:26:16.137 --> 01:26:17.071
FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES, BECAUSE I

01:26:17.138 --> 01:26:18.973
KNOW THAT THE BIG, BIG STORES

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:22.377
ARE NOT GOING TO COME TO LIKE A

01:26:22.443 --> 01:26:24.546
CARUTHERS OR A BIOLA. THEY'RE

01:26:24.612 --> 01:26:26.748
NOT GOING TO COME. AND SO HOW DO

01:26:26.814 --> 01:26:30.318
WE CREATE THE PROGRAM? AND I

01:26:30.385 --> 01:26:33.054
KNOW THAT THE CDFA WILL

01:26:33.121 --> 01:26:34.989
ESSENTIALLY DRAFT REGULATIONS,

01:26:35.056 --> 01:26:39.360
BUT WHERE OUR SMALL MAYBE THE

01:26:39.427 --> 01:26:40.094
SMALLER GROCERS THAT YOU'RE

01:26:40.161 --> 01:26:42.564
TALKING ABOUT THAT MAY WANT TO

01:26:42.630 --> 01:26:44.098
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS

01:26:44.165 --> 01:26:45.800
INCENTIVE, ARE GIVING A GREATER

01:26:45.867 --> 01:26:48.236
INCENTIVE OR GREATER MARKS SO

01:26:48.303 --> 01:26:50.171
THAT THEY'RE NOT COMPETING

01:26:50.238 --> 01:26:52.040
AGAINST THE BIG BOX STORES THAT

01:26:52.106 --> 01:26:53.975
WE KNOW ARE NOT GOING TO COME TO

01:26:54.042 --> 01:26:55.076
THOSE COMMUNITIES. SO I THINK

01:26:55.143 --> 01:26:56.711
THAT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY,

01:26:56.778 --> 01:26:58.613
AND IF THE AUTHOR IS AMENABLE, I

01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:00.615
THINK THAT WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT

01:27:00.682 --> 01:27:02.417
INCLUDING SOME INTENT LANGUAGE

01:27:02.483 --> 01:27:04.986
TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS SOME

01:27:05.053 --> 01:27:07.021
EQUITY IN THE EQUITY THAT WE

01:27:07.088 --> 01:27:08.456
KNOW THAT OBVIOUSLY, CDFA HAS

01:27:08.523 --> 01:27:09.657
SUPPORTED IN THE VARIETY OF

01:27:09.724 --> 01:27:12.193
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT THEY DO

01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:14.295
ADMINISTER. AND SO I THINK WE'RE

01:27:14.362 --> 01:27:15.730
HEARING FROM SEVERAL OF MY

01:27:15.797 --> 01:27:17.231
COLLEAGUES, AND I KNOW THAT'S

01:27:17.298 --> 01:27:18.566
SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:27:18.633 --> 01:27:20.068
ME, YOU KNOW, AND OBVIOUSLY IT

01:27:20.134 --> 01:27:20.969
SEEMS LIKE YOU GUYS ARE

01:27:21.035 --> 01:27:22.670
SUPPORTIVE OF THAT. SO I DON'T

01:27:22.737 --> 01:27:24.439
SEE WHY THERE SHOULDN'T BE MAYBE

01:27:24.505 --> 01:27:27.175
SOME COMMITMENT FROM, YOU KNOW,

01:27:27.241 --> 01:27:29.410
THE SPONSORS AND THE AUTHOR. IF

01:27:29.477 --> 01:27:31.980
YOU GUYS COULD HELP US IN

01:27:32.046 --> 01:27:33.715
INCLUDING SOME OF THAT AS WE

01:27:33.781 --> 01:27:35.516
MOVE THIS FORWARD. I AGAIN, I'D

01:27:35.583 --> 01:27:37.719
LIKE TO SUPPORT IT TODAY, BUT I

01:27:37.785 --> 01:27:40.588
ALSO WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO

01:27:40.655 --> 01:27:42.023
ENSURE THAT WE'RE FIGURING OUT

01:27:42.090 --> 01:27:44.525
HOW THESE SMALLER GROCERY STORES

01:27:44.592 --> 01:27:45.994
REALLY ARE NOT COMPETING WITH

01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:48.429
THE BIG BOX STORES THAT ARE NOT

01:27:48.496 --> 01:27:49.430
GOING TO COME TO THE CARUTHERS

01:27:49.497 --> 01:27:50.965
AND THE BIOLA'S IN MY COMMUNITY.

01:27:51.032 --> 01:27:53.067
BUT MAYBE WE CAN INCENTIVIZE

01:27:53.134 --> 01:27:54.035
THESE. RICK. AND WHAT WERE THEIR

01:27:54.102 --> 01:27:58.573
NAMES? YEAH, THERE WE GO. HOW WE

01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:00.775
CAN INCENTIVIZE THEM TO, YOU

01:28:00.842 --> 01:28:03.611
KNOW, MAYBE COME TO BIOLA AND

01:28:03.678 --> 01:28:04.979
CARUTHERS AND SO FORTH. SO I

01:28:05.046 --> 01:28:06.814
WANTED TO GIVE THE AUTHOR AN

01:28:06.881 --> 01:28:07.949
OPPORTUNITY. OBVIOUSLY, AGAIN, I

01:28:08.016 --> 01:28:09.951
SUPPORT THE INTENT AND THE GOAL

01:28:10.018 --> 01:28:13.287
THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO, YOU

01:28:13.354 --> 01:28:14.856
KNOW, TO MOVE FORWARD IN THIS

01:28:14.922 --> 01:28:16.190
PIECE OF LEGISLATION. I KNOW,

01:28:16.257 --> 01:28:17.558
OBVIOUSLY, YOU REPRESENT A VERY

01:28:17.625 --> 01:28:19.160
DIFFERENT DISTRICT FROM MANY OF

01:28:19.227 --> 01:28:21.529
THE DISTRICTS THAT ARE UP HERE.

01:28:21.596 --> 01:28:23.364
OURS ARE MUCH MORE RURAL, AND WE

01:28:23.431 --> 01:28:25.199
ALSO WANT THIS TO WORK FOR OUR

01:28:25.266 --> 01:28:26.601
COMMUNITY. SO MAYBE IF YOU COULD

01:28:26.668 --> 01:28:28.369
SPEAK TO YOUR WILLINGNESS TO DO

01:28:28.436 --> 01:28:31.572
THAT TODAY. WELL, FIRST OF ALL,

01:28:31.639 --> 01:28:33.141
THANK YOU FOR THIS ENGAGEMENT.

01:28:33.207 --> 01:28:34.142
BUT I WANT TO MAKE SOME

01:28:34.208 --> 01:28:35.376
CLARIFYING STATEMENTS. YOU KNOW,

01:28:35.443 --> 01:28:37.078
NUMBER ONE, WHEN I SAID THAT WE

01:28:37.145 --> 01:28:39.647
HEARD ABOUT THE OPPOSITION LATE,

01:28:39.714 --> 01:28:41.015
THIS BILL HAS BEEN GOING THROUGH

01:28:41.082 --> 01:28:42.750
THE PROCESS. LAST YEAR WE PASSED

01:28:42.817 --> 01:28:44.652
IT. THE REASON, YOU KNOW, WE

01:28:44.719 --> 01:28:46.020
WEREN'T ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD

01:28:46.087 --> 01:28:47.855
WITH IT BECAUSE THERE WAS LACK

01:28:47.922 --> 01:28:48.890
OF FUNDING. BUT THAT WAS THE

01:28:48.956 --> 01:28:49.791
ENTIRE YEAR. I DIDN'T HEAR ANY

01:28:49.857 --> 01:28:51.559
OF THIS OPPOSITION. AND AS I

01:28:51.626 --> 01:28:53.494
SPOKE TODAY, TO BE CLEAR, I WAS

01:28:53.561 --> 01:28:55.830
IN SPEAKING ABOUT YOU. I SAID MY

01:28:55.897 --> 01:28:57.065
FRIEND SAID UFCW, WHO I'VE HAD A

01:28:57.131 --> 01:28:58.399
20 YEAR RELATIONSHIP WITH. I

01:28:58.466 --> 01:28:59.133
WILL REITERATE, THIS IS THE

01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:00.835
FIRST TIME I'VE HEARD THEM

01:29:00.902 --> 01:29:02.270
OPPOSING AS IT PERTAINS TO THE

01:29:02.336 --> 01:29:03.638
DISCUSSION WE HAD WITH YOU. I

01:29:03.705 --> 01:29:05.373
THINK YOU USED THE WORD WERE

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:06.941
IGNORED, AND I THINK THAT'S VERY

01:29:07.008 --> 01:29:08.176
STRONG BECAUSE WE HAD MULTIPLE

01:29:08.242 --> 01:29:09.877
MEETINGS, MULTIPLE DISCUSSIONS

01:29:09.944 --> 01:29:11.913
WITH MY STAFF. IT WAS LIKE WE

01:29:11.979 --> 01:29:13.614
CLOSED THE DOOR ON YOU AND WE

01:29:13.681 --> 01:29:15.650
DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE YOUR IDEAS.

01:29:15.717 --> 01:29:16.217
THERE WAS DIALOG, THERE WAS

01:29:16.284 --> 01:29:17.719
CONVERSATIONS. AND YOU'RE RIGHT,

01:29:17.785 --> 01:29:19.287
YOU DID COME. I THINK IT WAS IN

01:29:19.353 --> 01:29:21.689
APRIL. BUT AGAIN, IT'S NOT THAT

01:29:21.756 --> 01:29:24.492
WE IGNORED YOUR STATEMENTS AND

01:29:24.559 --> 01:29:25.426
COMPLETELY DISMISSED YOU. THAT

01:29:25.493 --> 01:29:27.862
WAS IN THE CASE. THERE WAS

01:29:27.929 --> 01:29:29.964
CONVERSATIONS. YOU'RE RIGHT. AND

01:29:30.031 --> 01:29:32.133
THE REALITY IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING

01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:33.835
TO DO IS I KEEP HEARING THIS

01:29:33.901 --> 01:29:35.703
EITHER OR SITUATION, AND I DON'T

01:29:35.770 --> 01:29:37.538
THINK IT HAS TO BE EITHER OR. I

01:29:37.605 --> 01:29:40.041
THINK WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO

01:29:40.108 --> 01:29:41.175
MAKE IT ALL WORK. AND EVEN

01:29:41.242 --> 01:29:43.010
THOUGH I DO LIVE IN A DIFFERENT

01:29:43.077 --> 01:29:44.712
AREA THAN YOU, CHAIR, I HAVE TO

01:29:44.779 --> 01:29:46.981
TELL YOU, I LIVE IN A FOOD

01:29:47.048 --> 01:29:48.583
DESERT AND I LIVE IN LA, LOS

01:29:48.649 --> 01:29:49.684
ANGELES COUNTY. THAT IS A

01:29:49.751 --> 01:29:51.519
PROBLEM BECAUSE THAT'S ALSO A

01:29:51.586 --> 01:29:52.253
MISCONCEPTION THAT BECAUSE WE

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:54.622
LIVE IN THESE BIG CITIES, WE

01:29:54.689 --> 01:29:56.324
HAVE GROCERY STORES IN EVERY

01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:57.859
CORNER. I KNOW AS A COUNCIL

01:29:57.925 --> 01:29:59.894
MEMBER, I REMEMBER IT'S ONE OF

01:29:59.961 --> 01:30:00.595
THE THINGS THAT I ALWAYS

01:30:00.661 --> 01:30:02.864
STRUGGLED WITH. WE HAVE A LIQUOR

01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:03.931
STORE, PROBABLY 3 IN 1 BLOCK, TO

01:30:03.998 --> 01:30:05.500
THE POINT THAT WE PUT A

01:30:05.566 --> 01:30:07.101
MORATORIUM ON THESE LIQUOR

01:30:07.168 --> 01:30:08.870
STORES, SO MUCH SO THAT EVEN A

01:30:08.936 --> 01:30:11.105
7-ELEVEN CAME IN AND WE HAD TO

01:30:11.172 --> 01:30:12.406
EVEN BAN THE SQUARE FOOTAGE OF

01:30:12.473 --> 01:30:14.342
HOW MUCH ALCOHOL THEY COULD SELL

01:30:14.408 --> 01:30:15.977
TO A LITTLE CORNER, AND MANDATED

01:30:16.043 --> 01:30:17.411
THAT THE FRONT BE STOCKED WITH

01:30:17.478 --> 01:30:18.913
NOTHING BUT FRUITS AND

01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:19.881
VEGETABLES. EVERYTHING WE COULD

01:30:19.947 --> 01:30:22.984
DO TO TRY AND GET OUR KIDS TO

01:30:23.050 --> 01:30:23.518
GRAB THAT FIRST FRUIT AND

01:30:23.584 --> 01:30:24.652
VEGETABLE, VERSUS ALL THE JUNK

01:30:24.719 --> 01:30:26.287
FOOD THAT THEY PUT IN FRONT. SO

01:30:26.354 --> 01:30:27.555
AGAIN, THERE'S A MISCONCEPTION

01:30:27.622 --> 01:30:29.390
THAT WE'RE L.A. COUNTY AND THAT

01:30:29.457 --> 01:30:31.192
WE'RE OVERFLOWING WITH MARKETS.

01:30:31.259 --> 01:30:32.994
THAT'S NOT THE REALITY, NOT IN

01:30:33.060 --> 01:30:35.029
MY COMMUNITY. I DO LIVE IN A

01:30:35.096 --> 01:30:36.931
FOOD DESERT. AND SO I THINK WE

01:30:36.998 --> 01:30:39.500
CAN FIND THAT OPPORTUNITY TO

01:30:39.567 --> 01:30:41.669
CONTINUE THE DIALOG. SO I STATED

01:30:41.736 --> 01:30:44.438
THAT FIRST THING WHEN I TOOK THE

01:30:44.505 --> 01:30:45.673
MICROPHONE THAT I THINK WE CAN

01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:47.375
FIND OPPORTUNITIES, BUT NOT

01:30:47.441 --> 01:30:48.910
DOING ANYTHING AT ALL IS REALLY

01:30:48.976 --> 01:30:50.344
NOT GOING TO HELP THE ISSUE

01:30:50.411 --> 01:30:52.146
HERE. I DO WANT TO THANK

01:30:52.213 --> 01:30:53.848
ASSEMBLY MEMBER RANSOM FOR

01:30:53.915 --> 01:30:56.818
SAYING WHAT SHE SAID. WE COULD

01:30:56.884 --> 01:30:58.586
CONTINUE TO NOT HAVE THESE

01:30:58.653 --> 01:30:59.320
OPPORTUNITIES AND OUR

01:30:59.387 --> 01:31:01.122
COMMUNITIES WILL CONTINUE TO GO

01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:02.390
WITHOUT, YOU KNOW, SUPERMARKETS.

01:31:02.456 --> 01:31:04.725
AND IT'S NOT OKAY. WE DO HAVE A

01:31:04.792 --> 01:31:06.894
LOT OF CHILDREN WHO ARE JUST NOT

01:31:06.961 --> 01:31:07.762
GETTING HEALTHY MEALS. SO

01:31:07.829 --> 01:31:09.664
WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO CONTINUE

01:31:09.730 --> 01:31:11.232
THE CONVERSATION, ABSOLUTELY.

01:31:11.299 --> 01:31:13.000
WE'RE NOT SAYING NO. AND WE'LL

01:31:13.067 --> 01:31:14.769
DEFINITELY FIGURE OUT A WAY TO

01:31:14.836 --> 01:31:15.837
STRENGTHEN THE LANGUAGE TO PUT

01:31:15.903 --> 01:31:17.305
SOME OF THE GUARDRAILS THAT YOU

01:31:17.371 --> 01:31:19.907
EXPRESSED. AND WITH THAT, I

01:31:19.974 --> 01:31:21.576
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE

01:31:21.642 --> 01:31:23.477

01:31:23.544 --> 01:31:25.379

PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK

01:32:20.034 --> 01:32:21.502
YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY

01:32:21.569 --> 01:32:22.770
TO PRESENT THIS. I WILL BE

01:32:22.837 --> 01:32:24.005
PRESENTING ON BEHALF OF MY

01:32:24.071 --> 01:32:25.406
COLLEAGUE, SENATOR UMBERG, WHO

01:32:25.473 --> 01:32:27.074
COULD NOT BE HERE TODAY. AND I

01:32:27.141 --> 01:32:30.378
BELIEVE THESE ARE OUR WITNESSES.

01:32:30.444 --> 01:32:33.281
SECOND, YOU MAY PROCEED. OH,

01:32:33.347 --> 01:32:34.782
LOOK AT THIS. WELL, THANK YOU.

01:32:34.849 --> 01:32:36.450
I'LL MAKE THIS SHORT. SO TODAY

01:32:36.517 --> 01:32:37.551
I'M PRESENTING THIS BILL ON

01:32:37.618 --> 01:32:40.087
BEHALF OF SENATOR UMBERG. IN

01:32:40.154 --> 01:32:41.088
2017, CALIFORNIA BANNED THE SALE

01:32:41.155 --> 01:32:43.291
OF PUPPIES AT RETAIL STORES.

01:32:43.357 --> 01:32:45.259
HOWEVER, HOWEVER, IT IS APPARENT

01:32:45.326 --> 01:32:48.329
THAT AS A RESULT, OTHER

01:32:48.396 --> 01:32:49.764
CLANDESTINE SALES CHANNELS WERE

01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:52.833
CREATED OFFERING THESE PUPPIES

01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:55.536
THAT WERE SOLD INAPPROPRIATELY.

01:32:55.603 --> 01:32:56.938
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PUPPIES ARE

01:32:57.004 --> 01:32:58.439
CURRENTLY BEING BRED OUT OF

01:32:58.506 --> 01:32:59.907
STATE, TYPICALLY IN SO-CALLED

01:32:59.974 --> 01:33:02.043
PUPPY MILLS, AND THEN SOLD

01:33:02.109 --> 01:33:04.712
OFTENTIMES ONLINE AND SHIPPED TO

01:33:04.779 --> 01:33:05.579
CALIFORNIANS, SOMETIMES DIRECTLY

01:33:05.646 --> 01:33:07.448
AND OTHER TIMES THROUGH BROKERS.

01:33:07.515 --> 01:33:08.716
CALIFORNIA STATE LAW HAS NEVER

01:33:08.783 --> 01:33:10.418
REQUIRED SHIPPERS OF DOGS TO

01:33:10.484 --> 01:33:13.220
SEND HEALTH CERTIFICATE FORMS TO

01:33:13.287 --> 01:33:15.723
CDFA, AND THIS BILL INTENDS TO

01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:17.391
REMEDY THIS AND THE INTEREST OF

01:33:17.458 --> 01:33:19.360
TIME. I WILL MAKE SURE TO GIVE

01:33:19.427 --> 01:33:21.462
MY WITNESSES THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:33:21.529 --> 01:33:23.030
SPEAK ON THE BILL. SO IF I MAY

01:33:23.097 --> 01:33:24.999
TURN IT OVER, GREAT. WE WILL NOW

01:33:25.066 --> 01:33:26.500
HEAR FROM THOSE TESTIFYING IN

01:33:26.567 --> 01:33:27.601
SUPPORT. PLEASE PROCEED. STATE

01:33:27.668 --> 01:33:29.036
YOUR NAME AND THE ORGANIZATION

01:33:29.103 --> 01:33:30.504
YOU'RE REPRESENTING. THANK YOU

01:33:30.571 --> 01:33:32.340
CHAIR. AND THANK YOU, SENATOR

01:33:32.406 --> 01:33:33.874
RUBIO. BRITNEY BENASSI, ON

01:33:33.941 --> 01:33:35.843
BEHALF OF THE ASPCA. AT ITS

01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:37.478
CORE, THIS BILL IS ABOUT

01:33:37.545 --> 01:33:38.879
PROTECTING CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS,

01:33:38.946 --> 01:33:40.247
PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING THEIR BEST

01:33:40.314 --> 01:33:41.248
TO MAKE THOUGHTFUL, LOVING

01:33:41.315 --> 01:33:42.750
CHOICES WHEN BRINGING A NEW PET

01:33:42.817 --> 01:33:44.485
INTO THEIR HOME. UNFORTUNATELY,

01:33:44.552 --> 01:33:46.020
MEN ARE. MANY ARE CURRENTLY

01:33:46.087 --> 01:33:48.122
BEING MISLED. EVERY YEAR,

01:33:48.189 --> 01:33:49.056
THOUSANDS OF PUPPIES ARE

01:33:49.123 --> 01:33:50.725
IMPORTED INTO OUR STATE FROM OUT

01:33:50.791 --> 01:33:52.426
OF STATE BREEDING OPERATIONS,

01:33:52.493 --> 01:33:54.128
OFTEN THROUGH ONLINE ADS THAT

01:33:54.195 --> 01:33:56.364
PRESENT THEM AS LOCAL, REPUTABLE

01:33:56.430 --> 01:33:58.299
AND HEALTHY. BUT BEHIND THE

01:33:58.366 --> 01:34:00.034
POLISHED WEBSITES, ADMITTEDLY

01:34:00.101 --> 01:34:01.702
ADORABLE PICTURES AND CAREFULLY

01:34:01.769 --> 01:34:04.271
WORDED LISTINGS IS OFTEN A VERY

01:34:04.338 --> 01:34:05.406
DIFFERENT STORY. ONE OF ANIMALS

01:34:05.473 --> 01:34:07.241
BRED IN LARGE SCALE FACILITIES

01:34:07.308 --> 01:34:09.343
WITH QUESTIONABLE CONDITIONS,

01:34:09.410 --> 01:34:10.778
INADEQUATE VET CARE, AND NO

01:34:10.845 --> 01:34:12.646
MEANINGFUL ACCOUNTABILITY,

01:34:12.713 --> 01:34:13.781
CONSUMERS HAVE NO WAY TO VERIFY

01:34:13.848 --> 01:34:15.816
THE ORIGIN OR HEALTH STATUS OF

01:34:15.883 --> 01:34:17.051
THE ANIMALS THEY'RE PURCHASING.

01:34:17.118 --> 01:34:18.586
AND WHEN SOMETHING GOES WRONG,

01:34:18.652 --> 01:34:20.888
WHEN THE PUPPY ARRIVES SICK OR

01:34:20.955 --> 01:34:21.622
THE BREEDER DISAPPEARS, THESE

01:34:21.689 --> 01:34:23.391
FAMILIES ARE LEFT WITH EMOTIONAL

01:34:23.457 --> 01:34:25.292
DISTRESS, UNEXPECTED VET BILLS,

01:34:25.359 --> 01:34:28.462
AND NO RECOURSE. SB 312 OFFERS A

01:34:28.529 --> 01:34:29.497
SOLUTION. IT REQUIRES THAT

01:34:29.563 --> 01:34:31.098
HEALTH CERTIFICATES FOR DOGS

01:34:31.165 --> 01:34:33.467
IMPORTED INTO OUR STATE ARE BE

01:34:33.534 --> 01:34:35.436
SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLY TO

01:34:35.503 --> 01:34:36.704
CDFA, AS WELL AS THE BUYER AND

01:34:36.771 --> 01:34:39.173
MADE ACCESSIBLE. THIS GIVES

01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:40.608
CONSUMERS ACCESS TO CLEAR

01:34:40.674 --> 01:34:41.809
FACTUAL INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE

01:34:41.876 --> 01:34:43.444
THEIR PETS ARE COMING FROM, AND

01:34:43.511 --> 01:34:45.079
WHETHER IT WAS HEALTHY AT THE

01:34:45.146 --> 01:34:46.347
TIME OF SHIPMENT. THIS KIND OF

01:34:46.414 --> 01:34:47.882
TRANSPARENCY IS ALREADY THE NORM

01:34:47.948 --> 01:34:49.583
IN MOST OTHER STATES.

01:34:49.650 --> 01:34:50.684
CALIFORNIA, ONE THAT PRIDES

01:34:50.751 --> 01:34:52.620
ITSELF ON OUR CONSUMER

01:34:52.686 --> 01:34:53.788
PROTECTION AND ANIMAL WELFARE,

01:34:53.854 --> 01:34:55.656
HAS UNFORTUNATELY FALLEN BEHIND

01:34:55.723 --> 01:34:57.992
THE CURVE ON THIS MATTER. THIS

01:34:58.059 --> 01:34:58.926
BILL ENSURES THAT BUYERS AREN'T

01:34:58.993 --> 01:35:00.594
LEFT IN THE DARK, THAT BAD

01:35:00.661 --> 01:35:02.596
ACTORS CAN'T HIDE BEHIND FALSE

01:35:02.663 --> 01:35:03.831
IDENTITIES, AND THAT THE STATE

01:35:03.898 --> 01:35:05.599
HAS THE INFORMATION NEEDED TO

01:35:05.666 --> 01:35:07.134
DETERMINE HOW MANY DOGS ARE

01:35:07.201 --> 01:35:08.769
BEING IMPORTED IN AND FROM

01:35:08.836 --> 01:35:10.871
WHERE. THANK YOU TO THE

01:35:10.938 --> 01:35:13.207
COMMITTEE FOR YOUR TIME, TO

01:35:13.274 --> 01:35:13.707

HUMANE SOCIETY, WHICH PROVIDES

01:35:23.317 --> 01:35:24.151
ANIMAL CARE, PUBLIC HEALTH

SERVICES FOR 13 CITIES IN SAN

01:35:27.321 --> 01:35:28.522
DIEGO COUNTY. FOR YEARS, WE'VE

01:35:28.589 --> 01:35:29.890
BEEN TOLD STORIES OF PUPPIES

01:35:29.957 --> 01:35:31.125
SHIPPED IN FROM OUT OF STATE

01:35:31.192 --> 01:35:32.993
BREEDERS VIA BROKERS WHO ARRIVE

01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:34.328
WITH PARVO, BRUCELLOSIS, OR

01:35:34.395 --> 01:35:35.863
FALSIFIED PAPERWORK. IF

01:35:35.930 --> 01:35:37.031
INVESTIGATORS IN CALIFORNIA

01:35:37.098 --> 01:35:38.365
WHETHER HUMANE LAW ENFORCEMENT,

ANIMAL CONTROL, PUBLIC HEALTH OR

01:35:40.034 --> 01:35:41.702
OUR CONSUMER PROTECTION AGENCIES

01:35:41.769 --> 01:35:43.003
WANT TO TRACE THE SOURCE,

01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:44.805
WHETHER FOR A DISEASE

01:35:44.872 --> 01:35:45.906
INVESTIGATION, A CONSUMER FRAUD

01:35:45.973 --> 01:35:47.708
CASE OR EVEN TAX EVASION PROBES,

01:35:47.775 --> 01:35:49.477
THE PAPER TRAIL SIMPLY ISN'T

01:35:49.543 --> 01:35:51.712
THERE. CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF FEW

01:35:51.779 --> 01:35:53.614
STATES THAT DON'T KEEP A CENTRAL

01:35:53.681 --> 01:35:54.281
RECORD OF THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH

01:35:54.348 --> 01:35:55.683
CERTIFICATES THAT ACCOMPANY

01:35:55.749 --> 01:35:56.550
THESE DOGS, LEAVING US BLIND TO

01:35:56.617 --> 01:35:58.586
BOTH PUBLIC HEALTH RISKS AND

01:35:58.652 --> 01:35:59.753
CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. THE LOS

01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:01.155
ANGELES TIMES RECENTLY SPENT

01:36:01.222 --> 01:36:02.656
YEARS INVESTIGATING AND

01:36:02.723 --> 01:36:04.391
COLLECTING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

01:36:04.458 --> 01:36:05.626
THESE CERTIFICATES, ONE PUBLIC

01:36:05.693 --> 01:36:07.061
RECORDS REQUEST AT A TIME FROM

01:36:07.128 --> 01:36:08.529
16 DIFFERENT STATES. JUST TO

01:36:08.596 --> 01:36:10.231
SHOW HOW EASILY SICK OR

01:36:10.297 --> 01:36:12.366
MISREPRESENTED PUPPIES SLIP PAST

01:36:12.433 --> 01:36:13.567
CALIFORNIA'S SAFEGUARDS, THEIR

01:36:13.634 --> 01:36:15.269
EXPOSÉ DOCUMENTED HOW CURRENT

01:36:15.336 --> 01:36:16.070
REQUIREMENTS FOR HEALTH

01:36:16.137 --> 01:36:17.271
CERTIFICATES TO BE FURNISHED TO

01:36:17.338 --> 01:36:18.572
LOCAL COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS

01:36:18.639 --> 01:36:20.407
SIMPLY ISN'T WORKING. IT WAS

01:36:20.474 --> 01:36:21.709
REMARKABLE JOURNALISM, BUT IT

01:36:21.775 --> 01:36:22.910
SHOULDN'T TAKE A NEWSROOM THE

01:36:22.977 --> 01:36:25.346
TIME IT DID TO COLLECT BASIC

01:36:25.412 --> 01:36:26.947
INFORMATION THAT CONSUMERS

01:36:27.014 --> 01:36:27.948
EXPECT OUR STATE TO HAVE IN

01:36:28.015 --> 01:36:30.718
HAND. SB 312 CLOSES THIS GAP BY

01:36:30.784 --> 01:36:32.520
REQUIRING OUT-OF-STATE SHIPPERS

01:36:32.586 --> 01:36:33.954

01:36:41.562 --> 01:36:42.630
CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER

01:36:42.696 --> 01:36:43.697

THIS HAPPENS A LOT IN MY

01:37:49.263 --> 01:37:51.232
DISTRICT, AND WE ALSO BORDER

01:37:51.298 --> 01:37:52.466
NEVADA AND OREGON. SO WE OFTEN

01:37:52.533 --> 01:37:55.502

YOUR TESTIMONY. WAS VERY

01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:07.147
CLARIFYING BECAUSE I ACTUALLY

01:38:07.214 --> 01:38:08.482
HAD SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

01:38:08.549 --> 01:38:10.117
BILL. AND I STILL HAVE QUESTIONS

01:38:10.184 --> 01:38:11.952
ABOUT KIND OF CAN YOU KIND OF

01:38:12.019 --> 01:38:13.053
WALK US THROUGH HOW IT WOULD

01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:15.122
WORK? BECAUSE MY WE DON'T REALLY

01:38:15.189 --> 01:38:16.423
REGULATE OTHER STATES. RIGHT.

01:38:16.490 --> 01:38:17.691
AND THE DOGS ARE COMING FROM

01:38:17.758 --> 01:38:19.593
OTHER STATES. SO CAN YOU JUST

01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:21.495
FOR THE RECORD, JUST TELL US HOW

01:38:21.562 --> 01:38:23.497
THAT WORKS, WHERE WE'LL BE ABLE

01:38:23.564 --> 01:38:25.232
TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE PROTECTING

01:38:25.299 --> 01:38:27.468
OUR, YOU KNOW, FUTURE PET OWNERS

01:38:27.534 --> 01:38:30.938
FROM BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF.

01:38:31.005 --> 01:38:33.507
MADAM CHAIR, YOU MAY PROCEED

01:38:33.574 --> 01:38:35.576
WITH SAN DIEGO HUMANE SOCIETY.

01:38:35.643 --> 01:38:37.478
THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY PART OF A

01:38:37.544 --> 01:38:38.612
PACKAGE OF BILLS, AND WE'RE

01:38:38.679 --> 01:38:39.780
GRATEFUL TO THE ASSEMBLY FOR

01:38:39.847 --> 01:38:42.449
SEEING FIT TO PASS AB 506 AND AB

01:38:42.516 --> 01:38:44.718
519 THAT ARE ADDRESSING OTHER

01:38:44.785 --> 01:38:46.120
ASPECTS OF THIS CALLED PUPPY

01:38:46.186 --> 01:38:48.188
MILL PIPELINE INTO CALIFORNIA.

01:38:48.255 --> 01:38:51.258
AND SB 312 IS REALLY ALMOST THE

01:38:51.325 --> 01:38:52.593
ENFORCEMENT PIECE THAT WE NEED

01:38:52.660 --> 01:38:54.628
IN THAT WE AGAIN, WE'RE ONE OF

01:38:54.695 --> 01:38:55.863
FEW STATES. THERE ARE THESE

01:38:55.929 --> 01:38:57.331
FEDERAL FORMS. THEY'RE CALLED

01:38:57.398 --> 01:38:58.098
FORM 700 FROM USDA THAT ARE

01:38:58.165 --> 01:39:00.000
HEALTH CERTIFICATES THAT

01:39:00.067 --> 01:39:00.868
CALIFORNIA ALREADY REQUIRES

01:39:00.934 --> 01:39:02.536
ACTUALLY FOR A LOT OF LIVESTOCK

01:39:02.603 --> 01:39:04.171
SPECIES. SO CDFA HAS A LOT OF

01:39:04.238 --> 01:39:04.838
EXPERIENCE RECEIVING THESE

01:39:04.905 --> 01:39:06.774
FORMS. AND THEY'RE DONE VIA E

01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:07.975
FILE. SO THE VETERINARIAN IN

01:39:08.042 --> 01:39:09.476
ANOTHER STATE IS ALREADY

01:39:09.543 --> 01:39:11.345
REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW TO

01:39:11.412 --> 01:39:13.280
TRANSMIT THIS TO E FILE. THIS.

01:39:13.347 --> 01:39:14.548
IN FACT, THEY HAVE BEEN COMING

01:39:14.615 --> 01:39:15.749
INTO CALIFORNIA AND BEING

01:39:15.816 --> 01:39:17.051
DELETED BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A

01:39:17.117 --> 01:39:18.986
STATE LAW THAT REQUIRES CDFA TO

01:39:19.053 --> 01:39:20.988
RECEIVE THEM. SO THEY ARE Â

01:39:21.055 --> 01:39:22.890
FILED BY THE VETERINARIAN WHO IS

01:39:22.956 --> 01:39:24.425
REQUIRED TO FILE THEM UNDER

01:39:24.491 --> 01:39:25.759
FEDERAL LAW BECAUSE THEY ARE

01:39:25.826 --> 01:39:27.594
SUPPOSED TO ACTUALLY ACCOMPANY A

01:39:27.661 --> 01:39:29.029
SHIPMENT OF PUPPIES AND BE GIVEN

01:39:29.096 --> 01:39:30.764
TO THE BUYER. WHAT WE DON'T HAVE

01:39:30.831 --> 01:39:32.766
IS WHAT ALL THESE OTHER STATES

01:39:32.833 --> 01:39:34.068
HAVE IS A COPY OF THAT GIVEN TO

01:39:34.134 --> 01:39:35.836
OUR STATE. YOU KNOW, THEY USED

01:39:35.903 --> 01:39:37.571
TO BE IN PAPER. THEY'RE NOW DONE

01:39:37.638 --> 01:39:39.106
ELECTRONICALLY. AND BECAUSE THIS

01:39:39.173 --> 01:39:41.141
BILL WOULD ACTUALLY CLARIFY THAT

01:39:41.208 --> 01:39:42.309
CALIFORNIA INDEED WANTS TO

01:39:42.376 --> 01:39:43.610
RECEIVE THEM AND IS DEMANDING

01:39:43.677 --> 01:39:45.512
THAT THEY RECEIVE THEM FROM

01:39:45.579 --> 01:39:46.613
EXPORTING FROM SHIPPERS COMING

01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:49.183
INTO THE STATE, THEN MAKING THAT

01:39:49.249 --> 01:39:50.484
INFORMATION AVAILABLE. WE WILL

01:39:50.551 --> 01:39:52.052
NOW HAVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION

01:39:52.119 --> 01:39:53.554
THAT FOLKS HAVE IN OTHER STATES.

01:39:53.620 --> 01:39:55.622
OKAY. I GUESS THE PART I SHOULD

01:39:55.689 --> 01:39:56.857
HAVE ASKED IS, HOW DO WE COMPEL

01:39:56.924 --> 01:39:58.292
THE BAD ACTORS TO REGISTER?

01:39:58.359 --> 01:40:00.027
LIKE, IS THERE LIKE HOW DO WE IS

01:40:00.094 --> 01:40:02.296
IT IS THERE LIKE THE AIRPORT

01:40:02.363 --> 01:40:03.731
WILL KNOW BECAUSE THE DOGS ARE

01:40:03.797 --> 01:40:04.732
BEING SHIPPED? LIKE, HOW DO WE

01:40:04.798 --> 01:40:07.167
COMPEL THE BAD ACTORS TO ENSURE

01:40:07.234 --> 01:40:08.369
THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY GETTING

01:40:08.435 --> 01:40:09.770
THE DOGS TO THE VETS TO GET THE

01:40:09.837 --> 01:40:13.574
REPORTS? ON BEHALF OF THE ASPCA?

01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:16.143
I CAN CLARIFY THAT THE OUT OF

01:40:16.210 --> 01:40:18.011
STATE BAD ACTORS THAT DO NOT

01:40:18.078 --> 01:40:19.947
MEET THE STANDARDS THAT

01:40:20.013 --> 01:40:21.815
CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS RECOGNIZE

01:40:21.882 --> 01:40:23.851
ARE NOT NECESSARILY PERCEIVED AS

01:40:23.917 --> 01:40:25.486
BAD ACTORS WITHIN THEIR STATE.

01:40:25.552 --> 01:40:27.554
THEY HAVE VERY LOOSE ANIMAL

01:40:27.621 --> 01:40:29.056
WELFARE LAWS, BUT THEY ARE

01:40:29.123 --> 01:40:31.525
COMPELLED TO PROVIDE AN EXPORT

01:40:31.592 --> 01:40:33.360
CERTIFICATE OF VETERINARY

01:40:33.427 --> 01:40:35.562
INSPECTION. AND SO BY BY

01:40:35.629 --> 01:40:37.164
FOLLOWING THEIR OWN STATE LAWS,

01:40:37.231 --> 01:40:39.066
THEY WILL ALREADY BE

01:40:39.133 --> 01:40:40.167
AUTOMATICALLY SENDING OUT A

01:40:40.234 --> 01:40:41.969
HEALTH CERTIFICATE WITH THAT

01:40:42.035 --> 01:40:43.203
ANIMAL. IT'S JUST A MATTER OF

01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:44.972
RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA, NO ONE

01:40:45.038 --> 01:40:46.673
KNOWS WHERE THEY GO. GOT IT.

01:40:46.740 --> 01:40:48.709
OKAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT

01:40:48.776 --> 01:40:50.744

THESE SALARIES ARE NOT FUNDED BY

PUBLIC SERVICE WE PROVIDE, THE

POSITION HAS NEVER UNDERGONE A

01:45:55.916 --> 01:45:57.851
FORMAL SALARY REVIEW SINCE IT

01:45:57.918 --> 01:46:00.754
WAS CREATED. SB 493 FIXES THAT

01:46:00.821 --> 01:46:02.656
BY DIRECTING CDFA TO CONDUCT A

01:46:02.723 --> 01:46:04.558

CORRECTION BY REMOVING FROM THE

01:46:20.941 --> 01:46:23.643
SALARY APPROVAL PROCESS. PRIOR

01:46:23.710 --> 01:46:25.545
TO 2015, CAL HR WAS NOT

01:46:25.612 --> 01:46:26.947

ACTUALLY STREAMLINES AND MAKES

01:50:10.537 --> 01:50:11.037
THINGS SIMPLER. THEY WILL

01:50:11.104 --> 01:50:12.639
BASICALLY CONTRACT OUT FOR A

01:50:12.706 --> 01:50:14.507
SALARY SURVEY THAT'S FUNDED BY

01:50:14.574 --> 01:50:17.310
THE FAIRGROUNDS. AND THEN

01:50:17.377 --> 01:50:19.512
THERE'S A PROCESS IN HR THAT'S

01:50:19.579 --> 01:50:20.981
CONVOLUTED. THIS DOES NOT HELP

01:50:21.047 --> 01:50:22.048
THAT, BUT THAT WOULD BE

01:50:22.115 --> 01:50:24.050
SOMETHING ELSE TO ADDRESS. THIS

01:50:24.117 --> 01:50:26.319
WILL MAKE IT SIMPLER BECAUSE CAL

01:50:26.386 --> 01:50:27.787
HR WOULD BE REMOVED. AND THEN IT

01:50:27.854 --> 01:50:29.489
JUST GOES TO THE SECRETARY,

01:50:29.556 --> 01:50:30.056
WHICH IS THE CURRENT STATUS

01:50:30.123 --> 01:50:31.858
RIGHT NOW. THE BOARDS APPROVE

01:50:31.925 --> 01:50:33.626
IT, AND THEN IT GOES TO THE

01:50:33.693 --> 01:50:35.061
SECRETARY AND THEN IT GOES TO

01:50:35.128 --> 01:50:36.696
HR. SO IT REMOVES ONE LAYER OF

01:50:36.763 --> 01:50:38.331
THE PROCESS TO MAKE IT SIMPLER.

01:50:38.398 --> 01:50:39.966
IT'S THE HR PROCESS THAT WE NEED

01:50:40.033 --> 01:50:41.868
TO WORK ON. BUT THAT'S AN

01:50:41.935 --> 01:50:44.637
INTERNAL CDFA ISSUE OKAY. THANK

01:50:44.704 --> 01:50:48.608
YOU. THANK YOU. SO I APPRECIATE

01:50:48.675 --> 01:50:49.809
DEFINITELY THE SPIRIT OF THIS

01:50:49.876 --> 01:50:52.045
BILL IN MY DISTRICT. WE AND I

01:50:52.112 --> 01:50:53.680
KNOW YOU GUYS GET TIRED OF

01:50:53.747 --> 01:50:55.615
HEARING ABOUT WHAT WE DO IN OUR

01:50:55.682 --> 01:50:57.684
DISTRICT, BUT IN OUR DISTRICT WE

01:50:57.751 --> 01:50:58.251
HAVE A VERY CAPABLE, FAIR

01:50:58.318 --> 01:50:59.552
MANAGER THAT USED TO MANAGE

01:50:59.619 --> 01:51:01.287
COACHELLA. SO LIKE WE DO

01:51:01.354 --> 01:51:02.722
CONCERTS, WE DO EMERGENCY

01:51:02.789 --> 01:51:04.457
MANAGEMENT, WE DO COMMUNITY

01:51:04.524 --> 01:51:05.625
EVENTS, WE DO ALL OF THESE

01:51:05.692 --> 01:51:08.028
THINGS. AND THEN THERE'S THIS

01:51:08.094 --> 01:51:09.596
HUGE PAY DISPARITY. SO I JUST

01:51:09.662 --> 01:51:12.065
WANT TO CLARIFY THAT YOU MOVING

01:51:12.132 --> 01:51:13.800
TO THIS NEW SYSTEM, DOES THAT

01:51:13.867 --> 01:51:15.902
HELP CREATE MORE EQUITY WITH THE

01:51:15.969 --> 01:51:17.303
PAY. BECAUSE NOW WE'RE GOING TO

01:51:17.370 --> 01:51:19.272
BE USING KIND OF LIKE THIS

01:51:19.339 --> 01:51:20.306
DIFFERENT PACE OF LIKE A PAY

01:51:20.373 --> 01:51:22.075
SCALE. WILL THIS ARE WE LOOKING

01:51:22.142 --> 01:51:23.209
TO SOLVE THIS EQUITY AND LIKE

01:51:23.276 --> 01:51:25.879
PAY PEOPLE LIVABLE WAGES. YEAH,

01:51:25.945 --> 01:51:27.881
EXACTLY. THAT'S THE MAIN POINT

01:51:27.947 --> 01:51:28.548
OF THE BILL AND THE STREAMLINING

01:51:28.615 --> 01:51:29.716
OTHER THINGS. BUT YEAH, THAT'S

01:51:29.783 --> 01:51:30.984
THE MAIN POINT OF THE BILL.

01:51:31.051 --> 01:51:32.585
YEAH. OKAY. YEAH. SO THAT THAT

01:51:32.652 --> 01:51:33.720
IS THE REASON. THAT WAS MY

01:51:33.787 --> 01:51:35.355
UNDERSTANDING. I JUST WANTED TO

01:51:35.422 --> 01:51:37.223
GET CLARIFICATION ON THE RECORD.

01:51:37.290 --> 01:51:37.824
AND I THINK THIS IS REALLY

01:51:37.891 --> 01:51:40.226
IMPORTANT BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE

01:51:40.293 --> 01:51:41.227
FOLKS HAVE PRETTY MUCH BEEN

01:51:41.294 --> 01:51:42.762
VOLUNTEERING AND VERY HIGH LEVEL

01:51:42.829 --> 01:51:45.265
COMMUNITY NEEDED ROLES. AND SO

01:51:45.331 --> 01:51:46.966
FOR THAT, THOSE ARE THE REASONS

01:51:47.033 --> 01:51:48.001
I'M SUPPORTING. THANK YOU.

01:51:48.068 --> 01:51:48.568
ABSOLUTELY. NO, ABSOLUTELY.

01:51:48.635 --> 01:51:50.904
THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND AGAIN,

01:51:50.970 --> 01:51:51.504
WHEN COVID WE SAW THAT VERY,

01:51:51.571 --> 01:51:56.109
VERY STARKLY. YEAH. THANK YOU.

01:51:56.176 --> 01:51:58.812
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE. I KNOW HOW

01:51:58.878 --> 01:52:00.547
HARD OUR FAIRGROUNDS WORK AND

01:52:00.613 --> 01:52:03.149
OUR STAFF AND THOSE ARE MINIMAL.

01:52:03.216 --> 01:52:04.517
LIKE AS YOU SAID, THEY'RE

01:52:04.584 --> 01:52:06.386
VOLUNTEER. THERE'S A LOT GOING

01:52:06.453 --> 01:52:07.921
ON IN THE FAIRGROUNDS. YOU MAY

01:52:07.987 --> 01:52:09.422
JUST THINK IT'S DURING YOLO

01:52:09.489 --> 01:52:11.291
COUNTY FAIR OR WHATEVER, THE

01:52:11.357 --> 01:52:13.660
FOUR H SPRING FAIR OR WHATEVER

01:52:13.726 --> 01:52:14.961
THE CASE MIGHT BE. THERE'S SO

01:52:15.028 --> 01:52:17.230
MUCH ACTIVITY GOING ON, BUT I DO

01:52:17.297 --> 01:52:21.434
FEEL THAT THE PAY IS NEEDS TO BE

01:52:21.501 --> 01:52:23.670
FIXED THROUGHOUT THE STATE,

01:52:23.736 --> 01:52:26.473
BECAUSE YOU MIGHT BE A SMALL

01:52:26.539 --> 01:52:27.073
FAIRGROUNDS, BUT YOU'RE STILL

01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:29.542
DOING THE SAME AMOUNT OF WORK AS

01:52:29.609 --> 01:52:30.877
SOME OF THE BIGGER ONES. SO I

01:52:30.944 --> 01:52:32.645
THINK THIS IS A GREAT BILL.

01:52:32.712 --> 01:52:33.880
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT

01:52:33.947 --> 01:52:35.014

01:52:43.857 --> 01:52:47.460
WAS MADE. AND JUST FOR CLARITY.

01:52:47.527 --> 01:52:49.829
