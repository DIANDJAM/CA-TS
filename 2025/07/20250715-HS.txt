SITE, AND INCREASE SAFE PARKING

00:50:46.376 --> 00:50:48.612
SITE HOURS. YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE

00:50:48.678 --> 00:50:51.882
A LITTLE ACCOUNTABILITY HERE. IN

00:50:51.948 --> 00:50:53.917

ARE YOUR WITNESSES PRESENT IN

00:51:22.712 --> 00:51:23.713
THE CHAMBER, IN THE HEARING

ROOM? OH, THERE'S Ó. ALL RIGHT.

00:51:27.651 --> 00:51:28.785
SEEMS THERE SEEMS THEY'RE DOUBLE

00:51:28.852 --> 00:51:31.455
BOOKED RIGHT NOW, BUT, WELL, TO

00:51:31.521 --> 00:51:33.290
SUMMARIZE THEIR COMMENTS, AS

00:51:33.356 --> 00:51:34.591
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH SEVERAL

00:51:34.658 --> 00:51:36.927
COMMITTEES NOW, ONE, ON BEHALF

00:51:36.993 --> 00:51:38.795
OF THE WESTERN MANUFACTURING,

00:51:38.862 --> 00:51:40.964
WHAT THEY HAVE SHARED IS THAT BY

00:51:41.031 --> 00:51:42.599
HAVING RV ENCAMPMENTS, SOMETIMES

00:51:42.666 --> 00:51:44.501
THESE RVS COME AND PARK NEAR THE

00:51:44.568 --> 00:51:46.336
MOBILE HOME PARKS. AND SO IT

00:51:46.403 --> 00:51:48.038
MAKES IT DIFFICULT BECAUSE

00:51:48.104 --> 00:51:50.874
PEOPLE THERE WANT TO LIVE IN A

00:51:50.941 --> 00:51:54.578
QUALITY HOME, YOU KNOW, FREE OF

00:51:54.644 --> 00:51:56.046
DEBRIS AND TRASH AND PEOPLE

00:51:56.112 --> 00:51:57.280
TAKING THEIR SHOWERS OUTSIDE ON

00:51:57.347 --> 00:51:59.583
THE SIDEWALK AND ALL OF THAT.

00:51:59.649 --> 00:52:01.485
AND PEOPLE HAVE AN ASSOCIATION

00:52:01.551 --> 00:52:03.453
OF ASSUMING THE RVS ARE THE

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:05.055
MOBILE HOMES, WHICH THEY'RE NOT.

00:52:05.121 --> 00:52:08.892
THEY'RE TWO TOTALLY SEPARATE

00:52:08.959 --> 00:52:11.962
VEHICLES. IT ALSO IS A MISNOMER

00:52:12.028 --> 00:52:13.530
AND COMMUNICATION BECAUSE THEN

00:52:13.597 --> 00:52:15.465
PEOPLE THINK, WELL, MOBILE

00:52:15.532 --> 00:52:16.700
HOMES, YOU CAN JUST PLACE THEM

00:52:16.766 --> 00:52:18.068
ANYWHERE AND YOU CAN'T. THERE

00:52:18.134 --> 00:52:20.370
ARE VERY SPECIFIC RULES TO THAT.

00:52:20.437 --> 00:52:21.972
MISS SHELBY, WHO WOULD SPEAK ON

00:52:22.038 --> 00:52:24.274
BEHALF OF THE CITY OF COMPTON,

00:52:24.341 --> 00:52:26.142
WILL SHARE WITH YOU. AND I'M

00:52:26.209 --> 00:52:28.144
SHOWING YOU A PICTURE HERE. THIS

00:52:28.211 --> 00:52:29.846
IS AN EXAMPLE OF MY DISTRICT,

00:52:29.913 --> 00:52:31.915
WHERE WE HAVE SOME STREETS WHERE

00:52:31.982 --> 00:52:35.151
RVS ARE LITERALLY MILES LONG.

00:52:35.218 --> 00:52:36.987
AND SO IMAGINE WHEN WE TOOK

00:52:37.053 --> 00:52:39.623
THESE PICTURES, WE GOT A LITTLE

00:52:39.689 --> 00:52:41.925
CLOSER AND A DOG CAME OUT AND

00:52:41.992 --> 00:52:43.994
ALMOST BIT ME. YOU HAD PEOPLE

00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:45.629
WHO WERE TAKING OFF THEIR

00:52:45.695 --> 00:52:47.797
CLOTHES TRYING TO COOK AND THROW

00:52:47.864 --> 00:52:50.233
THEIR ITEMS, YOU KNOW, DOWN IN

00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:51.568
THE TRASH, WHICH IS IMPACTING

00:52:51.635 --> 00:52:54.504
OUR SEAWATER, JUST NOT, YOU

00:52:54.571 --> 00:52:56.840
KNOW, ATTRACTIVE PARENTS CAN'T

00:52:56.907 --> 00:52:59.342
WALK THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL. AND

00:52:59.409 --> 00:53:00.777
THEN I FINALLY, I WOULD SAY,

00:53:00.844 --> 00:53:02.679
IMAGINE TRYING TO SELL YOUR HOME

00:53:02.746 --> 00:53:04.481
AND SOMEONE'S GOT TO TURN ON

00:53:04.548 --> 00:53:05.782
THIS STREET BEFORE THEY TURN ON

00:53:05.849 --> 00:53:07.551
YOUR STREET TO BUY YOUR, THEIR

00:53:07.617 --> 00:53:08.652
HOME. IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

00:53:08.718 --> 00:53:11.087
AND SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS WE

00:53:11.154 --> 00:53:14.391
WANT TO HELP PEOPLE WHO

00:53:14.457 --> 00:53:15.825
UNFORTUNATELY, ONLY HAVE THE

00:53:15.892 --> 00:53:17.160
RESOURCE OF A RECREATIONAL

00:53:17.227 --> 00:53:19.796
VEHICLE TO LIVE IN, TO GET THEM

00:53:19.863 --> 00:53:21.598
INTO A SAFE ENVIRONMENT WHERE

00:53:21.665 --> 00:53:23.133
THEY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT

00:53:23.199 --> 00:53:24.568
SOMEONE WALKING UP IN THE MIDDLE

00:53:24.634 --> 00:53:26.202
OF THE NIGHT, ATTACKING THEM,

00:53:26.269 --> 00:53:28.071
BREAKING INTO THEIR RV, TAKING

00:53:28.138 --> 00:53:29.906
ALL OF THEIR POSSESSIONS,

00:53:29.973 --> 00:53:31.141
GETTING THEM IN A PLACE WHERE

00:53:31.207 --> 00:53:33.043
THEY CAN HAVE HOT WATER, WHERE

00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:34.878
THEY CAN HAVE PROPER

00:53:34.945 --> 00:53:36.313
ELECTRICITY, AND WHERE THEY CAN

00:53:36.379 --> 00:53:38.214
BECOME MORE CONTRIBUTING TO

00:53:38.281 --> 00:53:40.650
SOCIETY. SO WITH THAT, I'LL TURN

00:53:40.717 --> 00:53:43.253
TO YOU AND HOPEFULLY I YOU'RE IN

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:44.821
A SUBCOMMITTEE MODE SO YOU CAN'T

00:53:44.888 --> 00:53:46.423
MAKE A MOTION. SO WITH THAT,

00:53:46.489 --> 00:53:48.291
I'LL ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT

00:53:48.358 --> 00:53:49.659
YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU,

00:53:49.726 --> 00:53:51.294
SENATOR, I APPRECIATE IT. DO WE

00:53:51.361 --> 00:53:52.128
HAVE ADDITIONAL MEMBERS OF THE

00:53:52.195 --> 00:53:53.930
PUBLIC WHO WISH TO TESTIFY IN

00:53:53.997 --> 00:53:55.198
SUPPORT OF THE BILL? PLEASE COME

00:53:55.265 --> 00:53:57.367

00:53:57.434 --> 00:53:58.535
IF YOU'RE HERE TO SUPPORT THE

00:53:58.602 --> 00:54:02.606
BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON. WALID

00:54:02.672 --> 00:54:04.107
HAJJAJ, REPRESENTING THE LEAGUE

00:54:04.174 --> 00:54:05.175
OF CALIFORNIA CITIES IN SUPPORT.

00:54:05.241 --> 00:54:06.910
THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU

00:54:06.977 --> 00:54:08.311
VERY MUCH. NOW, DO WE HAVE ANY

00:54:08.378 --> 00:54:09.879
WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THE

00:54:09.946 --> 00:54:11.581
BILL? PLEASE COME FORWARD. ANY

00:54:11.648 --> 00:54:12.949
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO WISH

00:54:13.016 --> 00:54:14.918
TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THE

00:54:14.985 --> 00:54:15.752
BILL? PLEASE COME TO THE

00:54:15.819 --> 00:54:16.820
MICROPHONE. SEEING NONE, I WILL

00:54:16.886 --> 00:54:18.989
BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE.

00:54:19.055 --> 00:54:21.391
IF A COMMITTEE MEMBERS WANTS TO

00:54:21.458 --> 00:54:23.560
COMMENT OR HAVE ANY QUESTIONS.

00:54:23.627 --> 00:54:25.629
SURE. GO FOR IT, MR. TAGUBA.

00:54:25.695 --> 00:54:26.963
AGAIN, I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:29.232
YOU. I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF

00:54:29.299 --> 00:54:31.067
THAT SAME IMAGE AND A LOT OF

00:54:31.134 --> 00:54:32.902
DIFFERENT AREAS ACROSS

00:54:32.969 --> 00:54:35.038
CALIFORNIA. I THINK THIS IS A

00:54:35.105 --> 00:54:35.839
GREAT BILL AND JUST HONORED THAT

00:54:35.905 --> 00:54:37.774
YOU HAVE ME AS A COAUTHOR. AND

00:54:37.841 --> 00:54:39.643
AGAIN, JUST WANT TO SAY THANK

00:54:39.709 --> 00:54:40.310
YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

00:54:40.377 --> 00:54:41.578
SENATOR RICHARDSON, I JUST WANT

00:54:41.645 --> 00:54:42.879
TO SAY THANK YOU FOR WORKING

00:54:42.946 --> 00:54:44.748
WITH MY COMMITTEE STAFF AND

00:54:44.814 --> 00:54:45.849
MYSELF ON THIS BILL. I THINK

00:54:45.915 --> 00:54:46.850
IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT

00:54:46.916 --> 00:54:48.752
THIS PROGRAM, THE URF, WAS

00:54:48.818 --> 00:54:50.353
FOUNDED DURING IN THE BUDGET

00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:51.688
PROCESS LAST CYCLE, RIGHT BEFORE

00:54:51.755 --> 00:54:53.556
YOU WERE SWORN IN AND FACE LESS

00:54:53.623 --> 00:54:55.025
SCRUTINY FROM MANY MEMBERS OF

00:54:55.091 --> 00:54:55.592
THE LEGISLATURE, INCLUDING

00:54:55.659 --> 00:54:57.093
MYSELF. HOW? THERE WASN'T A LOT

00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:58.628
OF REPORTING IN CONTRAST TO

00:54:58.695 --> 00:54:59.929
OTHER HOMELESSNESS DOLLARS OUT

00:54:59.996 --> 00:55:01.698
THERE. THIS SOURCE WAS NOT SO

00:55:01.765 --> 00:55:03.800
WELL ACCOUNTED FOR AND WAS OFTEN

00:55:03.867 --> 00:55:05.735
USED FOR SWEEPING, EVICTING

00:55:05.802 --> 00:55:07.537
FOLKS RATHER THAN PROVIDING THEM

00:55:07.604 --> 00:55:08.838
MORE OPPORTUNITIES. AND I THINK

00:55:08.905 --> 00:55:10.707
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE,

00:55:10.774 --> 00:55:11.808
IDENTIFYING THE PROBLEM THAT TOO

00:55:11.875 --> 00:55:12.709
MANY PEOPLE UNFORTUNATELY HAVE

00:55:12.776 --> 00:55:14.110
TO LIVE IN THEIR RVS, CAMPER

00:55:14.177 --> 00:55:16.880
VANS, OR CARS NEED A SAFE PLACE

00:55:16.946 --> 00:55:17.647
TO SLEEP AT NIGHT THAT'S

00:55:17.714 --> 00:55:18.748
APPROPRIATE, THAT'S SAFE FOR

00:55:18.815 --> 00:55:19.883
THEMSELVES AND OTHER PEOPLE. AND

00:55:19.949 --> 00:55:21.885
I DO APPLAUD YOU FOR THINKING

00:55:21.951 --> 00:55:23.153
CREATIVELY ABOUT THAT AND

00:55:23.219 --> 00:55:24.154
WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS

00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:25.822
WHO LIVE IN THEIR VEHICLES HAVE

00:55:25.889 --> 00:55:26.690
APPROPRIATE PLACE TO DO SO. AND

00:55:26.756 --> 00:55:28.758
YOU'RE USING URF TO DO THAT. AND

00:55:28.825 --> 00:55:29.893
THAT'S WHY IT'S GREAT THAT

00:55:29.959 --> 00:55:31.628
YOU'RE WORKING ON THIS LANGUAGE

00:55:31.695 --> 00:55:33.363
TO ALSO NOW REPORT ON THE GOOD

00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:34.931
THINGS. RIGHT? HOW MANY PEOPLE

00:55:34.998 --> 00:55:35.532
ARE BETTER OFF BECAUSE WE'RE

00:55:35.598 --> 00:55:36.700
USING THESE FUNDS? HOW MANY

00:55:36.766 --> 00:55:38.468
PEOPLE ARE BETTER OFF DOING

00:55:38.535 --> 00:55:39.769
THESE THINGS RATHER THAN JUST A

00:55:39.836 --> 00:55:41.004
AN EVICTION KIND OF FUND THAT'S

00:55:41.071 --> 00:55:42.772
BEING USED? SO I REALLY

00:55:42.839 --> 00:55:43.373
APPRECIATE AGAIN, YOU WORKING

00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:44.941
WITH US ON THESE AMENDMENTS.

00:55:45.008 --> 00:55:45.942
SINCE WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM AT

00:55:46.009 --> 00:55:48.978
THE TIME, WE WILL TAKE UP THIS

00:55:49.045 --> 00:55:49.646
MOTION, I'M SURE. MR. THANK YOU.

00:55:49.713 --> 00:55:51.281
I'LL PROBABLY MAKE THE MOTION AT

00:55:51.347 --> 00:55:53.516
THE APPROPRIATE TIME. SO I WANT

00:55:53.583 --> 00:55:54.250
TO THANK YOU FOR COMING TO

00:55:54.317 --> 00:55:56.252
PRESENT TO US. ALL RIGHT. THANK

00:55:56.319 --> 00:55:57.087
YOU, SENATOR RICHARDSON. AND I

00:55:57.153 --> 00:55:58.555
WOULD LIKE YOU TO CLOSE TO IF

00:55:58.621 --> 00:56:00.223
YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE. NO PROBLEM.

00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:01.925
A SMART PERSON THEN SAYS, I ASK

00:56:01.991 --> 00:56:04.060
FOR YOUR VOTE. IN CLOSING, I

00:56:04.127 --> 00:56:04.828
WOULD SAY I BELIEVE SANTA

00:56:04.894 --> 00:56:06.830
BARBARA WAS THE FIRST AREA THAT

00:56:06.896 --> 00:56:07.997
DID A SAFE PARKING SITE. WE NOW

00:56:08.064 --> 00:56:09.733
HAVE ONE IN LA COUNTY. SO FOR

00:56:09.799 --> 00:56:11.334
ANY OF YOU WHO WOULD LIKE TO

00:56:11.401 --> 00:56:13.403
ACTUALLY SEE ONE OF THE SITES IN

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:14.771
OPERATION AND HOW WE WANT TO

00:56:14.838 --> 00:56:15.872
IMPROVE THEM AND ENHANCE THEM,

00:56:15.939 --> 00:56:17.373
I'D BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT THAT.

00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:19.242
WITH THAT, I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE

00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:20.710
AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH

00:56:20.777 --> 00:56:23.079
YOU TO CELEBRATE OUR SUCCESS.

00:56:23.146 --> 00:56:24.147
THANK YOU SO MUCH, SENATOR. ALL

00:56:24.214 --> 00:56:25.615
RIGHT. WE WILL TAKE THAT UP AT

00:56:25.682 --> 00:56:27.250
THE APPROPRIATE TIME. NEXT, I

00:56:27.317 --> 00:56:29.886
THINK I SEE SENATOR CUEVAS HERE,

00:56:29.953 --> 00:56:31.221
SO WHENEVER SHE IS READY, SHE

00:56:31.287 --> 00:56:51.741
COULD TAKE UP ITEM TWO, SB 290.

00:56:53.443 --> 00:56:54.711
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK

00:56:54.778 --> 00:56:56.479
YOU, MISTER CHAIR. AND GOOD

00:56:56.546 --> 00:56:57.814
AFTERNOON, ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. I

00:56:57.881 --> 00:57:01.551
AM PROUD TO PRESENT SENATE BILL

00:57:01.618 --> 00:57:03.920
290, WHICH ELIMINATES A PUNITIVE

00:57:03.987 --> 00:57:06.589
AND OUTDATED BARRIER IN CALWORKS

00:57:06.656 --> 00:57:08.424
PROGRAM THAT DENIES AID TO

00:57:08.491 --> 00:57:10.226
FAMILIES WHO ARE ALREADY

00:57:10.293 --> 00:57:13.029
STRUGGLING WITH POVERTY. SB 290

00:57:13.096 --> 00:57:14.898
REPEALS THE CALWORKS

00:57:14.964 --> 00:57:16.332
IMMUNIZATION PENALTY THAT

00:57:16.399 --> 00:57:18.501
REDUCES A FAMILY'S GRANT IF THEY

00:57:18.568 --> 00:57:20.336
CANNOT PROVIDE DOCUMENTATION

00:57:20.403 --> 00:57:22.405
SHOWING THEIR CHILD HAS RECEIVED

00:57:22.472 --> 00:57:24.841
A REQUIRED IMMUNIZATION, EVEN

00:57:24.908 --> 00:57:27.110
WHEN THE CHILD MAY ALREADY BE

00:57:27.177 --> 00:57:29.612
VACCINATED. NEARLY NEARLY MOST

00:57:29.679 --> 00:57:32.782
OF OUR FAMILIES THAT PARTICIPATE

00:57:32.849 --> 00:57:35.385
IN CALWORKS ARE BLACK AND LATINA

00:57:35.451 --> 00:57:37.954
MOTHERS. COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

00:57:38.021 --> 00:57:39.789
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY

00:57:39.856 --> 00:57:41.624
MANY, MANY BUREAUCRATIC,

00:57:41.691 --> 00:57:45.495
OVERLAPPING HURDLES AND ALSO

00:57:45.562 --> 00:57:47.297
HAVE TO DEAL WITH INCOME

00:57:47.363 --> 00:57:48.431
INSECURITY WHILE THEY'RE WORKING

00:57:48.498 --> 00:57:50.867
THROUGH THESE HURDLES. AND WE

00:57:50.934 --> 00:57:52.702
KNOW THAT THESE FAMILIES OFTEN

00:57:52.769 --> 00:57:54.204
GET VACCINES AT CLINICS OR IN

00:57:54.270 --> 00:57:56.940
POP UP, POP UP SITES THAT OFTEN

00:57:57.006 --> 00:57:59.275
DO NOT ISSUE STANDARDIZED

00:57:59.342 --> 00:58:01.344
RECORDS, RESULTING IN PENALTIES

00:58:01.411 --> 00:58:03.479
NOT FOR FAMILY FAILING TO

00:58:03.546 --> 00:58:05.682
VACCINATE, BUT FOR LACKING

00:58:05.748 --> 00:58:09.586
ACCEPTABLE DOCUMENTATION. A 2023

00:58:09.652 --> 00:58:11.855
ABC TEN INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT

00:58:11.921 --> 00:58:13.556
PARENTS WERE SANCTIONED EVEN

00:58:13.623 --> 00:58:15.391
AFTER RECEIVING IMMUNIZATIONS,

00:58:15.458 --> 00:58:17.227
SIMPLY BECAUSE DOCUMENTATION

00:58:17.293 --> 00:58:20.129
DIDN'T MEET THE COUNTY STANDARD.

00:58:20.196 --> 00:58:21.097
ONE MOTHER SHARED THAT SHE GOT

00:58:21.164 --> 00:58:23.366
SHOTS AT A LOCAL EVENT, BUT

00:58:23.433 --> 00:58:25.468
WASN'T GIVEN AN OFFICIAL RECORD,

00:58:25.535 --> 00:58:27.937
AND THEREFORE HER AID WAS CUT.

00:58:28.004 --> 00:58:29.439
THE BILL BECOMES EVEN MORE

00:58:29.505 --> 00:58:31.140
URGENT GIVEN THE FEDERAL

00:58:31.207 --> 00:58:33.009
INSTABILITY AS IT RELATES TO

00:58:33.076 --> 00:58:34.878
SUBSIDIES FOR OUR MOST NEEDY

00:58:34.944 --> 00:58:38.014
FAMILIES. ON JUNE 9TH OF 2025,

00:58:38.081 --> 00:58:40.250
THE CDC'S ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON

00:58:40.316 --> 00:58:42.018
IMMUNIZATION PRACTICES, WHICH

00:58:42.085 --> 00:58:43.553
SETS THE VACCINE GUIDELINES

00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:44.854
REFERENCED IN CALWORKS LAWS,

00:58:44.921 --> 00:58:48.157
WERE DISMANTLED AND REPEALED.

00:58:48.224 --> 00:58:51.060
MANY OF THE NEW APPOINTEES. SO

00:58:51.127 --> 00:58:52.495
THERE'S A LOT OF INSTABILITY IN

00:58:52.562 --> 00:58:54.731
THE SPACE. THAT MEANS IT WILL BE

00:58:54.797 --> 00:58:57.867
VERY HARD FOR OUR FAMILIES WHO

00:58:57.934 --> 00:59:00.270
RELY ON CALWORKS TO GET MUCH

00:59:00.336 --> 00:59:02.305
NEEDED DOCUMENTATION, AND WE

00:59:02.372 --> 00:59:04.641
THINK THAT WE CAN HELP FAMILIES

00:59:04.707 --> 00:59:06.809
BE ABLE TO CARE FOR THEIR

00:59:06.876 --> 00:59:08.611
FAMILIES AND MEET THESE

00:59:08.678 --> 00:59:09.746
BUREAUCRATIC, ADMINISTRATIVE

00:59:09.812 --> 00:59:11.581
HURDLES IN A WAY THAT'S FAIR.

00:59:11.648 --> 00:59:13.216
WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IS

00:59:13.283 --> 00:59:15.518
YESENIA JIMENEZ WITH THE END

00:59:15.585 --> 00:59:18.087
CHILD POVERTY CALIFORNIA, AND

00:59:18.154 --> 00:59:20.156
HANG WITH THE COALITION OF

00:59:20.223 --> 00:59:22.325
CALIFORNIA WELFARE RIGHTS

CALWORKS RECIPIENT, I ALWAYS

01:00:01.764 --> 01:00:04.267
REMEMBER I USED TO CARRY AROUND

01:00:04.334 --> 01:00:04.934
MY LITTLE YELLOW CARD AND WOULD

01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:06.602
ALWAYS HAVE TO REMIND MY MOM OF

01:00:06.669 --> 01:00:07.670
WHERE THIS LITTLE VERIFICATION

01:00:07.737 --> 01:00:09.439
CARD WOULD BE. ACCORDING TO THE

01:00:09.505 --> 01:00:10.974
CALIFORNIA BUDGET AND POLICY

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:13.142

FAMILIES BY REMOVING UP TO $235

01:00:16.045 --> 01:00:17.814
FROM THEIR CASH ASSISTANCE.

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:18.781
THESE SANCTIONS CAN COST

01:00:18.848 --> 01:00:20.616

THEIR TOTAL CALWORKS BENEFITS.

01:00:23.252 --> 01:00:24.587
THAT'S MORE THAN 3000 ADULTS

01:00:24.654 --> 01:00:25.888
HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:00:25.955 --> 01:00:27.857
WHO ARE ANNUALLY HAVING THEIR

01:00:27.924 --> 01:00:30.093
ASSISTANCE REDUCED JUST DUE TO

01:00:30.159 --> 01:00:32.261
THIS IMMUNIZATION SANCTION. THAT

01:00:32.328 --> 01:00:33.663
MEANS THAT MORE THAN MORE THAN

01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:36.966
88, 86% OF THESE ADULTS RESIDE

01:00:37.033 --> 01:00:39.402
IN SINGLE PARENT FAMILIES OFTEN

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:41.971
ARE BEING BLACK AND LATINA MOMS

01:00:42.038 --> 01:00:44.307
WHO ARE THE PRIMARY BREADWINNERS

01:00:44.374 --> 01:00:45.108
FOR THEIR HOUSEHOLDS. WHAT'S

01:00:45.174 --> 01:00:47.276
MORE, IF A CALWORKS FAMILY FAILS

01:00:47.343 --> 01:00:48.378
TO PROVIDE PROOF OF THEIR

01:00:48.444 --> 01:00:49.612
CHILD'S VACCINATION VACCINATION

01:00:49.679 --> 01:00:50.913
EVEN IF THEIR CHILD IS

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:53.383
VACCINATED. AS MENTIONED, THESE

01:00:53.449 --> 01:00:54.951
FAMILIES ARE STILL SANCTIONED

01:00:55.018 --> 01:00:57.153
BECAUSE THEY FAIL TO PROVIDE

01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:58.855
PROOF, AND THIS IS DETRIMENTAL.

01:00:58.921 --> 01:00:59.822
DETRIMENTAL AS CALWORKS

01:00:59.889 --> 01:01:01.758
SANCTIONS ARE PROVEN TO

01:01:01.824 --> 01:01:02.892
DESTABILIZE FAMILIES TO THE

01:01:02.959 --> 01:01:04.827
POINT OF EVEN FAMILY SEPARATION

01:01:04.894 --> 01:01:05.962
AND REMOVAL INTO THE CHILD

01:01:06.029 --> 01:01:07.797
WELFARE SYSTEM, CREATING FAR

01:01:07.864 --> 01:01:09.866
WORSE OUTCOMES WHILE MAKING IT

01:01:09.932 --> 01:01:11.267
MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE PARENT TO

01:01:11.334 --> 01:01:13.569
GET THE CHILD VACCINATED. SO

01:01:13.636 --> 01:01:15.038
RATHER THAN COMPOUNDING THESE

01:01:15.104 --> 01:01:16.506
DIFFICULTIES WITH FINANCIAL

01:01:16.572 --> 01:01:18.141
SANCTIONS, SB 290 PROVIDES A

01:01:18.207 --> 01:01:20.043
MORE COMPASSIONATE AND EQUITABLE

01:01:20.109 --> 01:01:21.511
APPROACH TO SUPPORTING

01:01:21.577 --> 01:01:22.979
CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE

01:01:23.046 --> 01:01:23.846
FAMILIES. AND FOR THESE REASONS,

01:01:23.913 --> 01:01:25.281
WE URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK

01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:26.916

01:01:28.251 --> 01:01:30.019
HAVING ME HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY

01:01:30.086 --> 01:01:32.555
ON SB 290. MY NAME IS LU N

01:01:32.622 --> 01:01:34.290
NGUYEN. I AM THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR

01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:35.925
AT THE COALITION OF CALIFORNIA

01:01:35.992 --> 01:01:37.627
WELFARE RIGHTS ORGANIZATION.

01:01:37.693 --> 01:01:40.196
IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE. AND

01:01:40.263 --> 01:01:43.933
IT'S WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL TO THE

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.601
SENATOR FOR AUTHORING THIS BILL

01:01:45.668 --> 01:01:47.837
AND BEING SUCH A CHAMPION FOR

01:01:47.904 --> 01:01:50.673
THIS COMMUNITY. I'VE BEEN DOING

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:52.742
PUBLIC BENEFITS WORK FOR A VERY

01:01:52.809 --> 01:01:54.944
LONG TIME NOW. I STARTED OUT AS

01:01:55.011 --> 01:01:56.913
A DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDER AT THE

01:01:56.979 --> 01:01:59.415
EAST BAY COMMUNITY LAW CENTER

01:01:59.482 --> 01:02:00.683
FOR TEN YEARS. AND SO I SAW THIS

01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:03.953
PROBLEM FIRSTHAND. IN MY

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:06.923
EXPERIENCE, THE FOLKS THAT ARE

01:02:06.989 --> 01:02:09.759
ON PUBLIC BENEFITS ARE

01:02:09.826 --> 01:02:10.793
ECONOMICALLY STRUGGLING. THEY'VE

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:13.329
ALWAYS BEEN ECONOMICALLY,

01:02:13.396 --> 01:02:14.530
ECONOMICALLY STRUGGLING. THERE

01:02:14.597 --> 01:02:16.566
WASN'T A TIME THAT THEY WEREN'T

01:02:16.632 --> 01:02:17.834
ECONOMICALLY STRUGGLING AND

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:21.337
DOING OKAY. AND AS IN THE

01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:22.772
EVOLUTION OF THE CALWORKS

01:02:22.839 --> 01:02:24.540
PROGRAM, WE ARE PUSHING FOR A

01:02:24.607 --> 01:02:26.109
TWO GENERATION APPROACH TO

01:02:26.175 --> 01:02:28.144
POVERTY, RECOGNIZING THAT WE ARE

01:02:28.211 --> 01:02:29.946
LOOKING TOWARDS THE FUTURE AND

01:02:30.012 --> 01:02:31.414
THESE CHILDREN ARE THE FUTURE,

01:02:31.481 --> 01:02:33.716
AND THAT WE NEED TO DO THINGS TO

01:02:33.783 --> 01:02:34.951
FOCUS ON THEIR WELL-BEING AND

01:02:35.017 --> 01:02:36.619
THEIR HEALTH. AND THE CHALLENGE

01:02:36.686 --> 01:02:38.521
WITH THE POLICY LIKE THIS IS

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:40.089
THAT YOU PUNISH THE CHILDREN

01:02:40.156 --> 01:02:42.492
ALSO BY PUNISHING THE PARENT.

01:02:42.558 --> 01:02:45.027
AND WHEN YOU KNOW, AT A CERTAIN

01:02:45.094 --> 01:02:46.762
TIME IN OUR HISTORY, WE DID THIS

01:02:46.829 --> 01:02:49.532
AND WE CONTINUE TO DO IT A LOT

01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:50.800
AND A LOT OF PROGRAMS, AND THE

01:02:50.867 --> 01:02:53.302
DATA SHOWS THAT IT DOES NOT WORK

01:02:53.369 --> 01:02:54.370
OUT WELL. AND IN ESSENCE, WHAT

01:02:54.437 --> 01:02:56.606
HAPPENS HERE IS IN THE CALWORKS

01:02:56.672 --> 01:02:58.141
PROGRAM, YOU HAVE A FAMILY THAT

01:02:58.207 --> 01:03:01.277
AT MAXIMUM AT THE HIGHEST

01:03:01.344 --> 01:03:04.247
REGIONAL LEVEL, IS GETTING

01:03:04.313 --> 01:03:06.649
$1,171 A MONTH. AND WITH THIS

01:03:06.716 --> 01:03:09.452
SANCTION, THEY'RE GETTING $927 A

01:03:09.519 --> 01:03:11.721
MONTH. AND WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT

01:03:11.787 --> 01:03:13.156
EXTREME POVERTY IS THAT IT JUST

01:03:13.222 --> 01:03:14.957
MAKES IT HARDER FOR THE FAMILY

01:03:15.024 --> 01:03:15.992
TO BE ABLE TO DO ALL THE

01:03:16.058 --> 01:03:17.994
POSITIVE THINGS THAT THEY NEED

01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:19.395
TO DO FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:20.897
CHILDREN, INCLUDING CREATOR,

01:03:20.963 --> 01:03:22.865
CREATING GREATER ACCESS. AND

01:03:22.932 --> 01:03:24.600
WHAT WE'VE ALSO LEARNED FROM

01:03:24.667 --> 01:03:26.135
VARIOUS STUDIES IS THAT THE MORE

01:03:26.202 --> 01:03:27.537
INCOME YOU PROVIDE TO THE

01:03:27.603 --> 01:03:29.639
FAMILY, THE BETTER IMPACT IT HAS

01:03:29.705 --> 01:03:31.874
ON CHILDREN'S HEALTH, THE BETTER

01:03:31.941 --> 01:03:33.543
IMPACT IT HAS ON FAMILIES. LIKE

01:03:33.609 --> 01:03:34.710
WE'RE PUTTING THESE FAMILIES IN

01:03:34.777 --> 01:03:36.012
A SITUATION WHERE THEY CANNOT

01:03:36.078 --> 01:03:37.780
EVEN AFFORD THEIR RENT, AND IT'S

01:03:37.847 --> 01:03:39.782
LEADING TO HOMELESSNESS AND IT'S

01:03:39.849 --> 01:03:41.551
LEADING TO OTHER DEVASTATING

01:03:41.617 --> 01:03:42.985
EFFECT. AND FOR THOSE REASONS,

01:03:43.052 --> 01:03:44.520
WE SHOULDN'T BE DOING THIS. WE

01:03:44.587 --> 01:03:46.055
SHOULD BE CREATING A PROGRAM

01:03:46.122 --> 01:03:47.990
THAT SUPPORTS THE CHILDREN AND

01:03:48.057 --> 01:03:48.858
PROVIDES THEM WHAT THEY NEED.

01:03:48.925 --> 01:03:50.459
AND THIS POLICY AS IT EXISTS,

01:03:50.526 --> 01:03:52.795
DOESN'T DO THAT, WHICH IS WHY WE

01:03:52.862 --> 01:03:53.829
SUPPORT WHAT THE SENATOR IS

01:03:53.896 --> 01:03:55.531
DOING. AND WE'RE VERY

01:03:55.598 --> 01:03:57.133
APPRECIATIVE, AND WE ASK THAT

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:58.301
YOU CONSIDER THESE THINGS AS YOU

01:03:58.367 --> 01:03:59.835
MAKE YOUR DECISION AND SUPPORT

UNSHELTERED, WHEREAS NATIONALLY,

01:23:58.133 --> 01:24:01.136
THAT'S 20%. THIS BILL PROVIDES A

01:24:01.202 --> 01:24:02.704
DEFINITION OF FUNCTIONAL ZERO

01:24:02.771 --> 01:24:04.339

UNSHELTERED IS ONLY A STEP

01:24:16.985 --> 01:24:18.787
TOWARDS SOLVING THE PROBLEM

01:24:18.853 --> 01:24:23.057
OVERALL OF HOMELESSNESS. SB 606

01:24:23.124 --> 01:24:24.325
REQUIRES CITIES, COUNTIES AND

01:24:24.392 --> 01:24:26.795
CONTINUUM OF CARE PROGRAMS TO

01:24:26.861 --> 01:24:27.729

UNSHELTERED HOMELESSNESS IN

01:24:29.631 --> 01:24:31.833
THEIR JURISDICTION, WHILE ALSO

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:32.801
REQUIRING THEM TO PROVIDE

HOUSING UNITS NEEDED TO ACHIEVE

01:24:35.069 --> 01:24:37.472
FUNCTIONAL ZERO. OVERALL, WE

01:24:37.539 --> 01:24:39.574
KNOW THAT UNSHELTERED IS THE

01:24:39.641 --> 01:24:41.409
MOST INHUMANE FORM OF

01:24:41.476 --> 01:24:42.610
HOMELESSNESS. PEOPLE DYING ON

01:24:42.677 --> 01:24:45.113
OUR STREETS, PEOPLE BEING ABUSED

01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:47.148
ON OUR STREETS, PEOPLE GETTING

01:24:47.215 --> 01:24:48.883
ADDICTED TO DRUGS ON THE STREETS

01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:50.718
SO THEY CAN STAY AWAKE TO MAKE

01:24:50.785 --> 01:24:52.287
SURE THEIR STUFF DOESN'T GET

01:24:52.353 --> 01:24:54.456
STOLEN. AND EVERY DAY, EVERY

01:24:54.522 --> 01:24:57.058
NIGHT IN THE CAPITAL, WHEN I

01:24:57.125 --> 01:24:58.760
WALK BACK TO THE HOTEL WHERE I

01:24:58.827 --> 01:25:01.596
STAY, I PASS PEOPLE LIVING IN

01:25:01.663 --> 01:25:03.465
DOORWAYS SO CLOSE, LITERALLY IN

01:25:03.531 --> 01:25:07.035
THE SHADOW OF OUR CAPITOL. AND

01:25:07.101 --> 01:25:08.937
IT JUST DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS

01:25:09.003 --> 01:25:10.538
WAY AND SHOULDN'T BE THIS WAY.

01:25:10.605 --> 01:25:12.140
THE GOOD NEWS IS WE ARE SEEING

01:25:12.207 --> 01:25:13.975
PROGRESS TOWARDS FUNCTIONAL ZERO

01:25:14.042 --> 01:25:14.843
UNSHELTERED IN SEVERAL PARTS OF

01:25:14.909 --> 01:25:19.547
THE STATE. SANTA BARBARA, SO

01:25:19.614 --> 01:25:20.648
COUNTIES AND CITIES DOING THE

01:25:20.715 --> 01:25:22.217
MATH AND CALCULATING HOW MANY

01:25:22.283 --> 01:25:24.953
UNITS THEY NEED FOR FUNCTIONAL

01:25:25.019 --> 01:25:26.521
ZERO SANTA BARBARA, SAN JOSE AND

01:25:26.588 --> 01:25:28.356
SAN MATEO COUNTY ARE PROVING

01:25:28.423 --> 01:25:30.024
IT'S POSSIBLE THROUGH DETAILED

01:25:30.091 --> 01:25:32.527
PLANNING AND DECISIVE USE OF

01:25:32.594 --> 01:25:34.062
MODULAR HOUSING AND OTHER

01:25:34.128 --> 01:25:35.730
SOLUTIONS TO GET THERE. IN SANTA

01:25:35.797 --> 01:25:36.764
BARBARA, THE COUNTY ADOPTED A

01:25:36.831 --> 01:25:39.667
PLAN TO ACHIEVE FUNCTIONAL ZERO

01:25:39.734 --> 01:25:40.435
UNSHELTERED AFTER EXPERIENCING

01:25:40.502 --> 01:25:41.870
THEIR SUCCESS WITH INTERIM

01:25:41.936 --> 01:25:43.705
HOUSING, THEY CREATED AN 80 ROOM

01:25:43.771 --> 01:25:45.940
COMMUNITY CENTER THAT PROVED TO

01:25:46.007 --> 01:25:47.041
BE SUCH A SUCCESS. THE COUNTY

01:25:47.108 --> 01:25:48.343
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS EXPANDED

01:25:48.409 --> 01:25:49.944
THEIR PARTNERSHIP TO COMMIT TO

01:25:50.011 --> 01:25:51.679
BUILD AN ADDITIONAL 300 SPACES

01:25:51.746 --> 01:25:53.748
ACROSS THE COUNTY TO HELP CLOSE

01:25:53.815 --> 01:25:55.350
THE GAP. CURRENTLY, THERE ARE

01:25:55.416 --> 01:25:56.851
MORE THAN HALFWAY TO THEIR GOAL

01:25:56.918 --> 01:25:57.652
OF ACHIEVING FUNCTIONAL ZERO IN

01:25:57.719 --> 01:25:59.821
THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTY.

01:25:59.888 --> 01:26:02.457
AFTER STARTING THIS IN 2022,

01:26:02.524 --> 01:26:04.325
THIS BILL REQUIRES A DETAILED

01:26:04.392 --> 01:26:05.793
PLAN FOR FUNCTIONAL ZERO

01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:07.729
UNSHELTERED TO GET DOLLARS

01:26:07.795 --> 01:26:09.063
DURING THE NEXT FUNDING CYCLE.

01:26:09.130 --> 01:26:10.732
AND WHAT THIS MEANS IS REALLY

01:26:10.798 --> 01:26:13.368
ABOUT HOLDING THE LEGISLATURE

01:26:13.434 --> 01:26:14.736
ACCOUNTABLE. SORRY, HOLDING

01:26:14.802 --> 01:26:16.037
CITIES ACCOUNTABLE TO TOOLS THAT

01:26:16.104 --> 01:26:17.739
WE GAVE THEM. SOME OF YOU WERE

01:26:17.805 --> 01:26:21.609
NOT HERE LAST YEAR FOR 1395. A

01:26:21.676 --> 01:26:23.711
BILL THAT I DID THAT PASSED

01:26:23.778 --> 01:26:25.313
UNANIMOUSLY AFTER A LOT OF WORK

01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:28.416
OVER TWO YEARS THAT GAVE CITIES

01:26:28.483 --> 01:26:31.719
DIFFERENT TOOLS. AND SO THIS

01:26:31.786 --> 01:26:32.754
PLANNING PROCESS THAT WE'VE LAID

01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:34.956
OUT REALLY, AGAIN, HOLDS THESE

01:26:35.023 --> 01:26:36.224
CITIES ACCOUNTABLE, SAYS, DO YOU

01:26:36.291 --> 01:26:38.459
HAVE A VALID SHELTER CRISIS

01:26:38.526 --> 01:26:39.794
DECLARATION? HAVE YOU ADOPTED

01:26:39.861 --> 01:26:41.696
APPENDIX P BUILDING CODES? HAVE

01:26:41.763 --> 01:26:43.698

PERMANENT HOUSING UNITS, IN

01:26:47.468 --> 01:26:49.671
FACT. SO IT REALLY HOLDS THE

01:26:49.737 --> 01:26:51.072
CITIES ACCOUNTABLE TO TOOLS THAT

01:26:51.139 --> 01:26:54.008
WE HAVE GIVEN THEM. WE'VE SEEN

01:26:54.075 --> 01:26:55.443
THAT CITY PLANNERS OFTEN JUST

01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:57.211
HAVE A RELUCTANCE, EVEN THOUGH

01:26:57.278 --> 01:26:59.047
WE'VE SAID, YOU KNOW, WE'VE

01:26:59.113 --> 01:27:01.115
GIVEN YOU THESE TOOLS, YOU'RE

01:27:01.182 --> 01:27:02.550
NOT LIABLE IF YOU USE THESE

01:27:02.617 --> 01:27:03.484
TOOLS THAT STILL, THE INCENTIVES

01:27:03.551 --> 01:27:05.119
ARE NOT ALWAYS ALIGNED WHERE THE

01:27:05.186 --> 01:27:07.655
CITY HOUSING FOLKS WANT TO STILL

01:27:07.722 --> 01:27:12.493
SAY, GO PLATE EVERYTHING. AND,

01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:15.163
YOU KNOW, AND DELAYING US

01:27:15.229 --> 01:27:18.132
TOWARDS OUR GOALS. THIS ALSO

01:27:18.199 --> 01:27:19.734
REQUIRES CITIES AT A MINIMUM TO

01:27:19.801 --> 01:27:21.069
SUBMIT ANALYSIS AGAIN OF THE

01:27:21.135 --> 01:27:23.204
UNIT OF HOUSING TYPES OF HOUSING

01:27:23.271 --> 01:27:24.105
OF ALL TYPES TO ACHIEVE

01:27:24.172 --> 01:27:25.173
FUNCTIONAL ZERO. IT ALSO

01:27:25.239 --> 01:27:26.107
INVOLVES SMALLER CITIES. WHAT WE

01:27:26.174 --> 01:27:27.942
DON'T WANT TO SEE IS THAT I

01:27:28.009 --> 01:27:29.143
REPRESENT A LOT OF SMALLER

01:27:29.210 --> 01:27:31.179
CITIES. WE DON'T SEE THE SMALLER

01:27:31.245 --> 01:27:32.046
CITIES JUST PUSHING HOMELESS

01:27:32.113 --> 01:27:32.847
POPULATION TOWARDS LARGER CITIES

01:27:32.914 --> 01:27:33.982
AND SAYING IT'S YOUR PROBLEM. SO

01:27:34.048 --> 01:27:36.818
THIS ACTUALLY INVOLVES SMALLER

01:27:36.884 --> 01:27:38.987
AND MEDIUM SIZED CITIES INTO THE

01:27:39.053 --> 01:27:42.290
PROCESS, IN THE PROCESS. SO I

01:27:42.357 --> 01:27:43.291
BELIEVE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

01:27:43.358 --> 01:27:44.692
RESPONSIBLE TO LEAD THE NATION

01:27:44.759 --> 01:27:45.893
IN SOLVING THIS CRISIS WITH

01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:47.962
EMPATHY AND DATA DRIVEN, PROVEN

01:27:48.029 --> 01:27:49.998
MODELS. AND I HAVE A WITNESS

01:27:50.064 --> 01:27:51.666
HERE, ADRIAN COVERT, WHO'S THE

01:27:51.733 --> 01:27:52.800
SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF PUBLIC

01:27:52.867 --> 01:27:53.968
POLICY AT BAY AREA COUNCIL.

01:27:54.035 --> 01:27:55.236
THANK YOU, SENATOR. THANK YOU

01:27:55.303 --> 01:27:57.338
VERY MUCH. TWO MINUTES, PLEASE.

01:27:57.405 --> 01:27:58.706
YES, THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. AND

01:27:58.773 --> 01:27:59.907
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY

01:27:59.974 --> 01:28:01.676
NAME IS ADRIAN COVERT WITH THE

01:28:01.743 --> 01:28:02.777
BAY AREA COUNCIL. IT'S MY

01:28:02.844 --> 01:28:03.645
PLEASURE TO SPEAK WITH THE

01:28:03.711 --> 01:28:05.413
COMMITTEE TODAY ON BEHALF OF SB

01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:07.815
606, THE FUNCTIONAL ZERO ACT,

01:28:07.882 --> 01:28:09.150
EXCLUDING CALIFORNIA. AS THE

01:28:09.217 --> 01:28:11.753
SENATOR SAID, ONLY ABOUT 20% OF

01:28:11.819 --> 01:28:14.255
HOMELESS AMERICANS LACK ACCESS

01:28:14.322 --> 01:28:15.657
TO BASIC INTERIM HOUSING OR

01:28:15.723 --> 01:28:17.825
SHELTER OPTIONS. IN CALIFORNIA,

01:28:17.892 --> 01:28:19.994
IT'S 67%. THIS IS THE HIGHEST

01:28:20.061 --> 01:28:22.063
RATE IN THE NATION. AND FOR MOST

01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:23.698
UNSHELTERED HOMELESS

01:28:23.765 --> 01:28:25.066
CALIFORNIANS, THIS IS NOT A

01:28:25.133 --> 01:28:26.968
CHOICE. CALIFORNIA RANKS 49TH IN

01:28:27.035 --> 01:28:29.404
THE AMOUNT OF INTERIM OPTIONS

01:28:29.470 --> 01:28:31.472
AND SHELTER OPTIONS THAT IT

01:28:31.539 --> 01:28:32.940
PROVIDES PER HOMELESS RESIDENT.

01:28:33.007 --> 01:28:34.442
WITH JUST ABOUT FOUR BEDS FOR

01:28:34.509 --> 01:28:37.078
EVERY TEN RESIDENTS, FAR BELOW

01:28:37.145 --> 01:28:38.746
THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OF ABOUT

01:28:38.813 --> 01:28:40.081
SEVEN AND A HALF TEN BEDS. AND

01:28:40.148 --> 01:28:42.183
THE PROLIFERATION OF UNSHELTERED

01:28:42.250 --> 01:28:44.786
HOMELESSNESS HAS BEEN DISASTROUS

01:28:44.852 --> 01:28:46.320
FOR THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF

01:28:46.387 --> 01:28:48.456
HOMELESS CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS.

01:28:48.523 --> 01:28:50.591
THE FUTURE THE THIS FAILURE

01:28:50.658 --> 01:28:52.794
COSTS LIVES, INCLUDING ROUGHLY

01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:54.562
7000 HOMELESS CALIFORNIANS WHO

01:28:54.629 --> 01:28:56.030
DIE ON OUR STREETS EACH YEAR,

01:28:56.097 --> 01:28:58.499
MANY FOR REASONS NO OTHER THAN

01:28:58.566 --> 01:28:59.834
THE ELEMENTS THAT THEY ARE

01:28:59.901 --> 01:29:01.402
SUBJECTED TO WHILE THEY WERE

01:29:01.469 --> 01:29:03.204
OUTDOORS. IT ALSO COSTS US

01:29:03.271 --> 01:29:04.172
RESOURCES, INCLUDING BILLIONS OF

01:29:04.238 --> 01:29:06.741
DOLLARS SPENT ON CLEANING

01:29:06.808 --> 01:29:08.543
ENCAMPMENTS AND ON EFFECTIVE

01:29:08.609 --> 01:29:11.012
SHELTER CLEARINGS, WITHOUT

01:29:11.079 --> 01:29:13.347
RELOCATING FOLKS TO SOME PLACE

01:29:13.414 --> 01:29:15.483
TO GO. THAT MONEY COULD HAVE

01:29:15.550 --> 01:29:17.251
GONE MORE EFFECTIVELY TO SHELTER

01:29:17.318 --> 01:29:19.120
OR HEALTHCARE OR HOUSING OR

01:29:19.187 --> 01:29:21.089
ANYTHING ELSE. WE MUST DO BETTER

01:29:21.155 --> 01:29:23.391
ON THIS. SB 606 WOULD REQUIRE

01:29:23.458 --> 01:29:24.792
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PLAN TO

01:29:24.859 --> 01:29:27.261
ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN FUNCTIONAL

01:29:27.328 --> 01:29:28.096
ZERO HOMELESSNESS AND

01:29:28.162 --> 01:29:29.163
UNSHELTERED HOMELESSNESS AS PART

01:29:29.230 --> 01:29:31.165
OF ITS REGIONALLY COORDINATED

01:29:31.232 --> 01:29:32.600
HOMELESS ACTION PLAN THAT THEY

01:29:32.667 --> 01:29:34.635
ALREADY DO. AS PART OF THE HAT

01:29:34.702 --> 01:29:35.536
PROCESS, AND FURTHER ENCOURAGE

01:29:35.603 --> 01:29:36.971
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO AVAIL

01:29:37.038 --> 01:29:38.539
THEMSELVES OF THE POWERS GRANTED

01:29:38.606 --> 01:29:40.108
TO THEM BY THE LEGISLATURE THE

01:29:40.174 --> 01:29:41.743
PAST SEVERAL YEARS TO MORE

01:29:41.809 --> 01:29:43.845
SPEEDILY AND AFFORDABLY SET

01:29:43.911 --> 01:29:45.513
THESE INTERIM HOUSING PROJECTS

01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:46.781
UP. JUST AS THE SENATOR

01:29:46.848 --> 01:29:48.616
MENTIONED A FEW MOMENTS AGO,

01:29:48.683 --> 01:29:49.984
ENDING UNSHELTERED HOMELESSNESS

01:29:50.051 --> 01:29:51.352
WON'T SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM

01:29:51.419 --> 01:29:52.754
RELATED TO OUR HOMELESSNESS

01:29:52.820 --> 01:29:55.022
CRISIS, BUT IT IS A CRITICAL

01:29:55.089 --> 01:29:56.824
FIRST STEP TOWARDS GETTING US

01:29:56.891 --> 01:29:58.359

01:30:59.787 --> 01:31:01.189
HOMELESSNESS AND THE CORPORATION

01:31:01.255 --> 01:31:02.490
FOR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. WE WERE

01:31:02.557 --> 01:31:03.691
ORIGINALLY OPPOSED UNLESS

01:31:03.758 --> 01:31:05.493
AMENDED. BUT THANKS TO THE

01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:06.794

01:31:08.129 --> 01:31:10.231
NEUTRAL AND APPRECIATE THE

01:31:10.298 --> 01:31:11.766

MOTION FOR THE BILL. NOW BRING

01:31:16.737 --> 01:31:18.239

01:31:23.911 --> 01:31:25.847
TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR WORKING

01:31:25.913 --> 01:31:26.981
WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND WORKING

01:31:27.048 --> 01:31:28.549
WITH MYSELF ON THIS IMPORTANT

01:31:28.616 --> 01:31:29.083
ISSUE, AS WE HAD SEVERAL

01:31:29.150 --> 01:31:30.785
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT, I REALLY DO

01:31:30.852 --> 01:31:32.153
BELIEVE IN ACHIEVING GETTING TO

01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:33.721
FUNCTIONAL ZERO UNSHELTERED. IT

01:31:33.788 --> 01:31:35.656
IS IT IS A MILESTONE. IT IS A

01:31:35.723 --> 01:31:36.724
STEPPING STONE TOWARDS

01:31:36.791 --> 01:31:37.658
FUNCTIONAL ZERO. IT'S HARD TO

01:31:37.725 --> 01:31:39.727
LEAPFROG YOUR WAY ALL THE WAY TO

01:31:39.794 --> 01:31:40.862
FUNCTIONAL ZERO WITHOUT THE

01:31:40.928 --> 01:31:42.630
ASPECT OF NO PEOPLE LIVING ON

01:31:42.697 --> 01:31:43.698
THE STREET. SO I DO THINK IT'S

01:31:43.764 --> 01:31:44.765
REALLY IMPORTANT, AND I THINK

01:31:44.832 --> 01:31:45.933
THAT YOU'RE BRINGING MORE

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.568
ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE PROCESS IS

01:31:47.635 --> 01:31:48.769
ALSO VERY IMPORTANT. SO

01:31:48.836 --> 01:31:49.604
REFLECTING ON MANY OF THOSE

01:31:49.670 --> 01:31:51.072
CONVERSATIONS, I'M HAPPY WE

01:31:51.138 --> 01:31:51.806
ARRIVE AT A POINT WHERE WE CAN

01:31:51.873 --> 01:31:52.907
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. THE ULTIMATE

01:31:52.974 --> 01:31:54.842
GOAL, OF COURSE, IS THAT NO ONE

01:31:54.909 --> 01:31:56.544
SHOULD BE LIVING IN THEIR CAR ON

01:31:56.611 --> 01:31:58.346
THE STREET ANYWHERE, BUT WE HAVE

01:31:58.412 --> 01:31:59.080
TO PROVIDE THEM INTERIM

01:31:59.146 --> 01:32:01.115
SOLUTIONS IN THE MEDIUM TERM TO

01:32:01.182 --> 01:32:02.250
GET PEOPLE WHERE THEY NEED TO BE

01:32:02.316 --> 01:32:04.085
AND PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES. AND

01:32:04.151 --> 01:32:05.519
I THINK THE BILL TODAY REFLECTS

01:32:05.586 --> 01:32:06.120
STRONGER THAT CONSENSUS WHERE

01:32:06.187 --> 01:32:07.955
WE'RE AT. AND I THINK THAT'S

01:32:08.022 --> 01:32:09.624
WHERE WE KIND OF WERE AT, EVEN

01:32:09.690 --> 01:32:10.825
IN HOUSING COMMITTEE WHEN WE

01:32:10.892 --> 01:32:12.493
TALKED THE FIRST TIME. SO I'M

01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:13.527
GLAD THE LANGUAGE TODAY REFLECTS

01:32:13.594 --> 01:32:15.096
THAT. SO WE BOTH STILL HAVE WE

01:32:15.162 --> 01:32:16.831
STILL ALSO HAVE A FUNCTIONAL

01:32:16.898 --> 01:32:17.465
ZERO UNSHELTERED DEFINITION IN

01:32:17.531 --> 01:32:18.666
THERE THAT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT

01:32:18.733 --> 01:32:19.734
IS AN IMPORTANT STEPPING STONE

01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:21.602
TOWARDS THE OVERALL GOAL OF

01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:22.136
ENDING HOMELESSNESS. SO I

01:32:22.203 --> 01:32:23.571
APPRECIATE THAT. I AM

01:32:23.638 --> 01:32:24.839
RECOMMENDING AN AYE VOTE, BUT

01:32:24.906 --> 01:32:25.840
I'LL ASK THE AUTHOR IF HE WOULD

01:32:25.907 --> 01:32:28.175
LIKE TO CLOSE. YEAH. THANK YOU

01:32:28.242 --> 01:32:28.709

01:32:28.776 --> 01:32:29.911

ALL THESE AREAS AND TOWARDS A

01:32:32.146 --> 01:32:32.713
LARGER GOAL. AND I RESPECTFULLY

ASK FOR MY VOTE. ALL RIGHT. THE

A STRATEGY TO GET RID OF THOSE

WHO THEY NO LONGER WANT TO CARE

02:13:00.439 --> 02:13:01.973
FOR. SINCE FAILURE TO PAY IS ONE

02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:03.275
OF THE FIVE LEGAL REASONS THAT

02:13:03.342 --> 02:13:05.010

02:13:24.863 --> 02:13:26.431
BECAUSE SHE IS NOT SSI ELIGIBLE,

02:13:26.498 --> 02:13:27.699
THE FACILITY IS ALLOWED TO

APPLY TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

02:46:35.285 --> 02:46:36.686
THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR. SO ALL

THIS BILL DOES IS CREATE A

02:46:40.023 --> 02:46:41.324
RELATIONSHIP WHERE WHEN THEY

02:46:41.391 --> 02:46:44.361
APPLY FOR CAL GRANT, THEY GET A

02:46:44.427 --> 02:46:45.362
NOTIFICATION THAT THEY ARE

02:46:45.428 --> 02:46:46.830
POTENTIALLY ELIGIBLE FOR

CALFRESH WITH SOME DIRECTION

02:46:48.264 --> 02:46:50.100
ABOUT HOW TO THEN GO APPLY FOR

02:46:50.166 --> 02:46:52.168
IT. A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF OUR

02:46:52.235 --> 02:46:53.970
YOUNG PEOPLE ARE REALLY HUNGRY

02:46:54.037 --> 02:46:55.905
IN COLLEGE, AND THEY'RE HAVING

02:46:55.972 --> 02:46:57.741

THEM WORK, AS I KNOW MANY OF YOU

02:46:59.843 --> 02:47:01.945
DID, I DID. I WAS A YOUNG,

02:47:02.011 --> 02:47:03.213
SINGLE MOM WHEN I WAS IN

02:47:03.279 --> 02:47:05.181
COLLEGE, AND I WAS RAISING MY

02:47:05.248 --> 02:47:07.083
SON ON MY OWN. I WENT TO UC

02:47:07.150 --> 02:47:07.884
DAVIS AND MCGEORGE LAW SCHOOL,

02:47:07.951 --> 02:47:09.619
BUT IF I DIDN'T HAVE FOOD

02:47:09.686 --> 02:47:11.020
STAMPS, WE WOULD HAVE BEEN

02:47:11.087 --> 02:47:13.456
HUNGRY. AND WHILE AND MR. CHANG

A COLLEGE ATHLETE, I WAS NOT A

02:47:18.228 --> 02:47:20.864
COLLEGE ATHLETE, OBVIOUSLY, BUT

02:47:20.930 --> 02:47:22.832
I WAS RAISING A LITTLE BOY WHO

02:47:22.899 --> 02:47:24.601
ALSO WOULD BECOME A NOSE TACKLE,

02:47:24.667 --> 02:47:26.770
AND THOSE GUYS NEED A LOT OF

02:47:26.836 --> 02:47:29.105
FOOD, SO I NEVER COULD HAVE DONE

02:47:29.172 --> 02:47:29.672
IT ON MY OWN. I WAS VERY

02:47:29.739 --> 02:47:31.775
GRATEFUL TO HAVE THE HELP AND

02:47:31.841 --> 02:47:33.643

IT'S THERE FOR THE STUDENTS IN

02:47:34.778 --> 02:47:36.546
THE YEARS TO COME. THAT IS WHAT

02:47:36.613 --> 02:47:37.981
THIS BILL IS ABOUT AND THAT IS

02:47:38.047 --> 02:47:39.816
WHY WE HAVE MOVED IT FORWARD. IT

02:47:39.883 --> 02:47:42.285
HAS ENJOYED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT

02:47:42.352 --> 02:47:44.354

STUDENTS ACROSS THE UC SYSTEM,

02:48:06.209 --> 02:48:08.311
SB 761 AIMS TO ENSURE COLLEGE

02:48:08.378 --> 02:48:09.245
AFFORDABILITY THROUGH A CRITICAL

02:48:09.312 --> 02:48:10.780
YET OFTEN OVERLOOKED COMPONENT

02:48:10.847 --> 02:48:13.249
FOOD SECURITY. ACCORDING TO THE

02:48:13.316 --> 02:48:15.285
2024 UC UNDERGRADUATE EXPERIENCE

02:48:15.351 --> 02:48:17.120
SURVEY, 48% OF UC STUDENTS

02:48:17.187 --> 02:48:18.354
EXPERIENCE SOME LEVEL OF FOOD

02:48:18.421 --> 02:48:19.823
INSECURITY LAST YEAR, MEANING

02:48:19.889 --> 02:48:21.224
THEY SKIPPED MEALS, CUT DOWN

02:48:21.291 --> 02:48:22.125
THEIR MEAL PORTIONS, AND

02:48:22.192 --> 02:48:23.960
STRUGGLE TO AFFORD BALANCED

02:48:24.027 --> 02:48:25.962
DIETS. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT

02:48:26.029 --> 02:48:27.130
FOOD INSECURITY RESULTS IN

02:48:27.197 --> 02:48:28.431
DIFFICULTY CONCENTRATING AND

02:48:28.498 --> 02:48:30.400
LOWER ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE. THIS

02:48:30.467 --> 02:48:31.534
RESULTS IN DECLINING COLLEGE

02:48:31.601 --> 02:48:33.002
ATTAINMENT AND COMPLETION,

02:48:33.069 --> 02:48:34.137
HOLDING BACK OUR STATE'S ECONOMY

02:48:34.204 --> 02:48:36.306
AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. OUR

02:48:36.372 --> 02:48:37.740
VERY OWN STUDENT LEADERS ON THE

02:48:37.807 --> 02:48:38.975
BOARD AND ACROSS THE UC HAVE

02:48:39.042 --> 02:48:40.243
DETAILED EXPERIENCES IN WHICH

02:48:40.310 --> 02:48:41.544
THEY STRUGGLE TO AFFORD RENT,

02:48:41.611 --> 02:48:43.613
GROCERIES AND TEXTBOOKS WITHOUT

02:48:43.680 --> 02:48:45.381
KNOWING THEY QUALIFY FOR FOOD

02:48:45.448 --> 02:48:46.349
ASSISTANCE THROUGH CALFRESH.

02:48:46.416 --> 02:48:47.717
OTHERS ATTEMPTED TO APPLY ONLY

02:48:47.784 --> 02:48:49.519
TO FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS. DUE

02:48:49.586 --> 02:48:50.987
TO THE COMPLEX NATURE OF

02:48:51.054 --> 02:48:51.754
ENROLLMENT AND LACK OF CONNECTED

02:48:51.821 --> 02:48:52.956
SUPPORT. WHILE THE UC WORKS TO

02:48:53.022 --> 02:48:54.357
COMBAT FOOD INSECURITY WITH

02:48:54.424 --> 02:48:55.325
BASIC NEED CENTERS AND FOOD

02:48:55.391 --> 02:48:57.126
PANTRIES ON EVERY CAMPUS, A MUCH

02:48:57.193 --> 02:48:59.229
LARGER ISSUE IS AT PLAY. MANY

02:48:59.295 --> 02:49:00.430
STUDENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR

02:49:00.497 --> 02:49:01.764
CALFRESH DON'T RECEIVE ITS

02:49:01.831 --> 02:49:03.566
BENEFITS. THE CALIFORNIA POLICY

02:49:03.633 --> 02:49:06.169
LAB FOUND THAT ONLY 22% OF

02:49:06.236 --> 02:49:07.337
ELIGIBLE UC STUDENTS ARE

02:49:07.403 --> 02:49:09.038
ENROLLED IN CALFRESH, AND THAT

02:49:09.105 --> 02:49:10.106
THE MAIN REASON STUDENTS DON'T

02:49:10.173 --> 02:49:11.808
APPLY IS A LACK OF AWARENESS

02:49:11.875 --> 02:49:13.176
ABOUT THE PROGRAM. UC STUDENTS

02:49:13.243 --> 02:49:15.044
KNOW THIS FIRSTHAND. HUNDREDS OF

02:49:15.111 --> 02:49:16.813
THOSE WHO KNOW ABOUT CALFRESH

02:49:16.880 --> 02:49:18.314
OFTEN DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT

02:49:18.381 --> 02:49:19.415
THEY QUALIFY. WE STRONGLY

02:49:19.482 --> 02:49:21.251
SUPPORT SB 761 BECAUSE IT WILL

02:49:21.317 --> 02:49:22.652
COMBAT THE UNFAMILIARITY WITH

02:49:22.719 --> 02:49:23.953
CALFRESH BY INFORMING STUDENTS

02:49:24.020 --> 02:49:24.921
ABOUT THEIR ELIGIBILITY WHILE

02:49:24.988 --> 02:49:26.689
THEY APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID. IN

02:49:26.756 --> 02:49:28.258
DOING SO, NOT ONLY WILL IT

02:49:28.324 --> 02:49:29.592
REMOVE KNOWLEDGE BARRIERS TO

02:49:29.659 --> 02:49:30.193
NUTRITION ASSISTANCE, BUT IT

02:49:30.260 --> 02:49:31.928
WILL ALSO REACH OUT TO THOSE WHO

02:49:31.995 --> 02:49:33.196
ARE MOST LIKELY TO REQUIRE

02:49:33.263 --> 02:49:35.064
CALFRESH BENEFITS, MAKING THIS A

02:49:35.131 --> 02:49:36.833
PROMISING MEASURE TO COMBAT FOOD

02:49:36.900 --> 02:49:38.034
INSECURITY. BEING CONNECTED TO

02:49:38.101 --> 02:49:39.302
FOOD BENEFITS HELPS REMOVE

02:49:39.369 --> 02:49:40.270
BARRIERS FOR MANY STUDENTS WHO

02:49:40.336 --> 02:49:41.871
ARE JUST TRYING TO PURSUE

02:49:41.938 --> 02:49:43.940
ACADEMIC SUCCESS. THUS, SB 761

02:49:44.007 --> 02:49:45.341
WILL PROMOTE BETTER HEALTH,

02:49:45.408 --> 02:49:46.943
ATTENDANCE, AND ACADEMIC

02:49:47.010 --> 02:49:47.844

COLLEGE ACCESS ORGANIZATIONS IN

THE GREATER LOS ANGELES REGION.

02:50:10.967 --> 02:50:12.302
THE NETWORK COLLECTIVELY SERVES

02:50:12.368 --> 02:50:15.438
OVER 350,000 STUDENTS AND FAMILY

02:50:15.505 --> 02:50:17.140

02:50:22.412 --> 02:50:23.746
THOUGH, FOOD INSECURITY REMAINS

02:50:23.813 --> 02:50:26.049
AS A PERVASIVE OBSTACLE TO

02:50:26.115 --> 02:50:27.417
ACCOMPLISH THIS MISSION,

02:50:27.483 --> 02:50:28.618
ESPECIALLY FOR HISTORICALLY

02:50:28.685 --> 02:50:30.420
MARGINALIZED STUDENTS. AS A

02:50:30.486 --> 02:50:32.889
NETWORK WORKING WITH STUDENT

02:50:32.956 --> 02:50:34.257
ADVOCATES, IT IS CENTRAL TO OUR

02:50:34.324 --> 02:50:36.793

02:50:36.859 --> 02:50:38.328
EVERY TIME WE CONSULT WITH

02:50:38.394 --> 02:50:39.529
STUDENTS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND

02:50:39.596 --> 02:50:41.464
THESE CHALLENGES THEY FACE WHEN

PURSUING HIGHER EDUCATION, BY

ADDRESSING STUDENT, BY

02:50:44.834 --> 02:50:45.835
ADDRESSING THE BASIC NEEDS,

02:50:45.902 --> 02:50:47.470
THAT'S ALWAYS ONE OF THEIR

02:50:47.537 --> 02:50:48.972
BIGGEST CONCERNS. STUDENTS

02:50:49.038 --> 02:50:50.640
REPORT THAT AFFORD AFFORDING A

02:50:50.707 --> 02:50:52.008
BASIC STANDARD OF LIVING IS A

02:50:52.075 --> 02:50:54.077
MAJOR ISSUE FOR THEM, DUE TO THE

02:50:54.143 --> 02:50:55.144
INSUFFICIENT FINANCIAL AID THEY

02:50:55.211 --> 02:50:57.013
RECEIVE, JUGGLING MULTIPLE

02:50:57.080 --> 02:50:57.714
RESPONSIBILITIES, MAKING IT A

02:50:57.780 --> 02:50:59.816
LOT HARDER FOR THEM TO GENERATE

02:50:59.882 --> 02:51:01.651
WORK AND INCOME. WE KNOW THAT

02:51:01.718 --> 02:51:03.186
COUPLING FINANCIAL AID WITH

02:51:03.252 --> 02:51:04.554
OTHER SOCIAL SAFETY NET BENEFITS

02:51:04.621 --> 02:51:05.755
CAN HELP THEM CLOSE THE GAPS

02:51:05.822 --> 02:51:07.523
THAT FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE

02:51:07.590 --> 02:51:09.659
PACKAGES LEAVE IN A STUDENT'S

02:51:09.726 --> 02:51:10.727
FULL COST OF ATTENDANCE,

02:51:10.793 --> 02:51:12.829
INCLUDING NOT NON TUITION COSTS.

02:51:12.895 --> 02:51:14.130
THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE

02:51:14.197 --> 02:51:15.765
RECENTLY PUBLISHED A REPORT THAT

02:51:15.832 --> 02:51:17.166
HIGHLIGHTS THIS CALFRESH CAN

02:51:17.233 --> 02:51:18.968
REDUCE FINANCIAL BURDEN AFTER

02:51:19.035 --> 02:51:20.403
TAKING FINANCIAL AID PACKAGES

02:51:20.470 --> 02:51:23.539
INTO ACCOUNT FOR UC, CSU

02:51:23.606 --> 02:51:25.441
STUDENTS ALMOST BY HALF. IT ALSO

02:51:25.508 --> 02:51:26.743
REDUCES THE FINANCIAL BURDEN FOR

02:51:26.809 --> 02:51:28.578
COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS BY

02:51:28.645 --> 02:51:30.980
24%. THIS IS A BIG REASON WHY

02:51:31.047 --> 02:51:32.281
MANY OF OUR NETWORK MEMBERS GO

02:51:32.348 --> 02:51:33.683
FAR BEYOND HELPING STUDENTS TO

02:51:33.750 --> 02:51:36.085
APPLY FOR COLLEGE AND EMPHASIZE

02:51:36.152 --> 02:51:39.355
HOW LONG TIME, HOW EMPHASIZE FOR

02:51:39.422 --> 02:51:40.957
A LONG TIME NOW TO CONNECT

02:51:41.024 --> 02:51:42.325
STUDENTS FOR THEIR SOCIAL

02:51:42.392 --> 02:51:43.793
BENEFITS BEYOND THE TRADITIONAL

02:51:43.860 --> 02:51:45.261
FINANCIAL AID, WHICH IS WHY WE

02:51:45.328 --> 02:51:47.797
BELIEVE SB 7761 ADDRESSES THESE

02:51:47.864 --> 02:51:48.798
CHALLENGES. THE BILL WILL

02:51:48.865 --> 02:51:49.932
CLARIFY THAT STUDENTS ARE

02:51:49.999 --> 02:51:51.034
ELIGIBLE SIMPLY BY BEING

02:51:51.100 --> 02:51:52.902
ENROLLED IN ONE OF THE THOUSANDS

02:51:52.969 --> 02:51:54.537
OF APPROVED POST-SECONDARY

02:51:54.604 --> 02:51:55.405
PROGRAMS OFFERED THROUGH THE

02:51:55.471 --> 02:51:57.140
PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. IT WILL

02:51:57.206 --> 02:51:58.541
ALSO CONNECT STUDENTS VIA

02:51:58.608 --> 02:52:00.009
COORDINATED OUTREACH EFFORTS

02:52:00.076 --> 02:52:01.944
WITH CRITICAL INFORMATION NEEDED

02:52:02.011 --> 02:52:03.212
TO APPLY AND MAKE THE PROCESS

02:52:03.279 --> 02:52:04.647
LESS CUMBERSOME FOR THEM. WE

02:52:04.714 --> 02:52:06.482
KNOW THAT THERE ARE HUNDREDS AND

02:52:06.549 --> 02:52:07.517
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

02:52:07.583 --> 02:52:09.018
STUDENTS OUT THERE WHO ARE

02:52:09.085 --> 02:52:10.520
ELIGIBLE BUT NOT ENROLLED IN

02:52:10.586 --> 02:52:13.256
CALFRESH. SB 761 MAKES SOME

02:52:13.322 --> 02:52:14.390
IMPORTANT CHANGES THAT WILL

02:52:14.457 --> 02:52:15.892
ALLOW THEM TO GET THE SUPPORT

02:52:15.958 --> 02:52:17.627
THAT THEY NEED AND GET HELP WITH

02:52:17.694 --> 02:52:18.795
THIS KIND OF ASSISTANCE. FOR
