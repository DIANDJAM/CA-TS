LOWENTHAL AND VICE CHAIR DIXON,

00:47:35.652 --> 00:47:37.120
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE, THANK

00:47:37.187 --> 00:47:39.056
YOU FOR HEARING MY BILL THIS

00:47:39.122 --> 00:47:42.726
MORNING. IT'S SB 69. AND TO

00:47:42.793 --> 00:47:45.796
START, I IS EVOLVING VERY

00:47:45.862 --> 00:47:48.799
QUICKLY. AND CALIFORNIA MUST

00:47:48.865 --> 00:47:51.335
DEVELOP THE LEGAL EXPERTISE TO

00:47:51.401 --> 00:47:56.306
KEEP UP WITH I. SB 69 MAKES SURE

00:47:56.373 --> 00:47:57.841
THAT CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

00:47:57.908 --> 00:47:59.676
JUSTICE IS READY OR WILL BE

00:47:59.743 --> 00:48:02.512
READY. THIS BILL CREATES AN AI

00:48:02.579 --> 00:48:05.015
FOCUSED TEAM AT THE DEPARTMENT

00:48:05.082 --> 00:48:08.485

MAKE SURE THAT AI IS SAFE AND

00:48:16.226 --> 00:48:17.861
BENEFICIAL. RIGHT NOW, THE

00:48:17.928 --> 00:48:20.130
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DOES NOT

00:48:20.197 --> 00:48:23.066
HAVE SUFFICIENT EXPERTISE TO

00:48:23.133 --> 00:48:25.502
HANDLE AI ISSUES. THIS BILL WILL

00:48:25.569 --> 00:48:28.972
CHANGE THAT. SB 69 ENSURES THAT

00:48:29.039 --> 00:48:31.308
THE DOJ WILL RECRUIT AND TRAIN

00:48:31.375 --> 00:48:33.744
AND TRAIN STAFF, WORK WITH

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:35.579

COMPLEMENTS THE GOVERNOR'S

00:48:42.886 --> 00:48:45.389

00:48:49.393 --> 00:48:52.095
CALIFORNIANS. WITH ME TODAY IS

00:49:17.788 --> 00:49:19.456
COMMON SENSE ARTIFICIAL

00:49:19.523 --> 00:49:21.358
INTELLIGENCE LEGISLATION. WE

00:49:21.425 --> 00:49:23.126
FOCUS OUR EFFORTS, ESPECIALLY ON

00:49:23.193 --> 00:49:24.127
PROTECTING KIDS AND, MORE

00:49:24.194 --> 00:49:25.962
BROADLY, U.S. CITIZENS WHOSE

00:49:26.029 --> 00:49:27.364
INTERESTS ARE GENERALLY

00:49:27.431 --> 00:49:28.832
DISREGARDED IN THE AGGRESSIVE

00:49:28.899 --> 00:49:32.102
ROLLOUT OF AI. WE'VE SUPPORTED

00:49:32.169 --> 00:49:34.871
AI BILLS AND BILL AUTHORS IN TEN

00:49:34.938 --> 00:49:37.808
STATES IN THE 2025 LEGISLATIVE

00:49:37.874 --> 00:49:41.078
SESSION. WE TRAVEL AROUND AND DO

00:49:41.144 --> 00:49:42.579
A LOT OF TESTIMONY LIKE THIS,

00:49:42.646 --> 00:49:44.681
AND OVER THE PAST SIX MONTHS,

00:49:44.748 --> 00:49:46.483
I'VE TALKED TO THREE DEPUTY

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:47.918
ATTORNEY GENERAL, ATTORNEYS

00:49:47.984 --> 00:49:50.053
GENERAL, AND IN VARIOUS STATES

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:51.955
IS I'M SURE MOST OF YOU KNOW,

00:49:52.022 --> 00:49:53.590
THE DEPUTY AG IS BASICALLY THE

00:49:53.657 --> 00:49:55.859
CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF AG'S

00:49:55.926 --> 00:49:57.394
OFFICE, BECAUSE THE AG'S HAVE SO

00:49:57.461 --> 00:49:59.062
MUCH POLITICAL, SO MANY

00:49:59.129 --> 00:50:00.597
POLITICAL REQUIREMENTS IN THEIR

00:50:00.664 --> 00:50:02.966
POST, THEY HAVE ALL SAID THAT

00:50:03.033 --> 00:50:04.901
THEY NEED AND WANT HELP. THEY

00:50:04.968 --> 00:50:07.104
KNOW THEY NEED EXPERTISE. THEY

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:08.772
KNOW THEY DON'T HAVE EXPERTISE

00:50:08.839 --> 00:50:12.409
ON THEIR STAFFS. AG OFFICES HAVE

00:50:12.476 --> 00:50:13.810
SPECIALISTS IN RACKETEERING AND

00:50:13.877 --> 00:50:15.445
RICO LAWS. THEY HAVE SPECIALISTS

00:50:15.512 --> 00:50:17.547
IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING, BUT THEY

00:50:17.614 --> 00:50:19.516
HAVE NO SPECIALIST IN TECH

00:50:19.583 --> 00:50:21.785
POLICY. AND THE TECH COMPANIES,

00:50:21.852 --> 00:50:22.686
ESPECIALLY THOSE TARGETING

00:50:22.753 --> 00:50:23.887
CONSUMERS, ARE REALLY RUNNING

00:50:23.954 --> 00:50:27.157
CIRCLES AROUND THEM WITH REGARDS

00:50:27.224 --> 00:50:27.724
TO THEIR CONSUMER PROTECTION

00:50:27.791 --> 00:50:31.428
LAWS. TO START WITH, I ALSO

00:50:31.495 --> 00:50:33.263
TALKED TO LESS THAN A MONTH AGO

00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:34.631
TO A SENIOR MEMBER OF THE

00:50:34.698 --> 00:50:36.366
MARYLAND STATE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS

00:50:36.433 --> 00:50:37.968
WHO HAD CHAMPIONED A KIDS CODE

00:50:38.034 --> 00:50:40.537
BILL THERE, SIMILAR TO THE ONE

00:50:40.604 --> 00:50:41.805
THAT'S BEEN PASSED HERE. IT WAS

00:50:41.872 --> 00:50:42.873
PASSED RECENTLY IN MARYLAND, WHO

00:50:42.939 --> 00:50:44.541
LITERALLY SAID TO ME THAT HE

00:50:44.608 --> 00:50:47.177
THOUGHT THAT AG TRAINING ON TECH

00:50:47.244 --> 00:50:49.012
POLICY WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN

00:50:49.079 --> 00:50:50.747
ENACTING ANY NEW LEGISLATION.

00:50:50.814 --> 00:50:56.586
THERE'S THAT BIG OF A GAP THERE.

00:50:56.653 --> 00:50:57.821
TRANSPARENCY COALITION OURSELVES

00:50:57.888 --> 00:51:00.290
ARE LOOKING AT STANDING UP A

00:51:00.357 --> 00:51:01.558
SMALL TRAINING GROUP TO BE ABLE

00:51:01.625 --> 00:51:03.927
TO HOLD ONE DAY SEMINARS FOR AG

00:51:03.994 --> 00:51:05.295
OFFICES AROUND THE COUNTRY, JUST

00:51:05.362 --> 00:51:07.497
TO GET THEM UP TO SPEED, TO

00:51:07.564 --> 00:51:08.999
RECOGNIZE THEY NEED SPECIALISTS,

00:51:09.065 --> 00:51:11.168
NOTHING MORE THAN THAT, AND EVEN

00:51:11.234 --> 00:51:12.536
THAT I'LL HAVE TROUBLE RAISING

00:51:12.602 --> 00:51:14.704
THE FUNDS TO DO IT. BUT I'M

00:51:14.771 --> 00:51:16.807
GOING TO TRY. THE LONG AND SHORT

00:51:16.873 --> 00:51:18.408
IS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND HERE

00:51:18.475 --> 00:51:20.977
IN CALIFORNIA, THERE IS A

00:51:21.044 --> 00:51:22.913
YAWNING NEED FOR EXPERTISE IN

00:51:22.979 --> 00:51:25.449
ENFORCING TECH POLICY. THIS IS A

00:51:25.515 --> 00:51:27.284
PLACE FOR CALIFORNIA TO TAKE A

00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:28.652
LEADERSHIP POSITION. SO MANY

00:51:28.718 --> 00:51:32.222
STATES LOOK TO YOU ALL AND THIS,

00:51:32.289 --> 00:51:34.758
THIS LEGISLATURE TO TAKE A

00:51:34.825 --> 00:51:36.993
LEADERSHIP POSITION AND PUTTING

00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:40.197
A STAKE IN THE GROUND TO FUND

00:51:40.263 --> 00:51:43.033
AND CREATE SPECIALISTS AND TECH

00:51:43.099 --> 00:51:44.501
POLICIES IS A IS A REALLY

00:51:44.568 --> 00:51:46.470
IMPORTANT LEADERSHIP ROLE TO

00:51:46.536 --> 00:51:49.306
TAKE JUST ONE OTHER THOUGHT, I'M

00:51:49.372 --> 00:51:50.674
I'VE STARTED A COMPANY. I'VE

00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:51.942
BEEN NUMBER TWO PERSON IN THE

00:51:52.008 --> 00:51:53.343
COMPANY. I'VE BEEN A FOUR TIME

00:51:53.410 --> 00:51:55.078
CEO. I'VE STARTED A NONPROFIT.

00:51:55.145 --> 00:51:56.913
NOW, I KNOW THIS IS A

00:51:56.980 --> 00:51:57.814
CHALLENGING BUDGET YEAR, AND

00:51:57.881 --> 00:51:59.115
THIS ISN'T ABOUT BUDGET RIGHT

00:51:59.182 --> 00:52:00.784
HERE IN THIS HEARING, BUT THIS

00:52:00.851 --> 00:52:02.953
DOESN'T NEED TO BE A LARGE

00:52:03.019 --> 00:52:04.421
GROUP. 4 TO 6 LAWYERS THAT ARE

00:52:04.488 --> 00:52:05.856
TRAINED WOULD REALLY MOVE THE

00:52:05.922 --> 00:52:07.390
NEEDLE RELATIVE TO A VACUUM

00:52:07.457 --> 00:52:09.559
TODAY. SO IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE

00:52:09.626 --> 00:52:11.294
A HUGE BUDGET ITEM TO GET

00:52:11.361 --> 00:52:13.497
STARTED IN YEAR 1 OR 2 AND COME

00:52:13.563 --> 00:52:15.131
UP TO SPEED AND GET SOME WINS. I

00:52:15.198 --> 00:52:16.967
STRONGLY SUPPORT YOU TO WRAP

00:52:17.033 --> 00:52:18.101
THIS UP. I STRONGLY SUPPORT

00:52:18.168 --> 00:52:20.270

THERE ANY IS THERE NOW TIME FOR

00:52:27.244 --> 00:52:29.446

SUPPORT OF THIS BILL? ME TOO.

00:52:32.148 --> 00:52:34.284

PRIVACY AND SUPPORT OF THE BILL.

00:52:41.458 --> 00:52:42.392
GOOD AFTERNOON. MARIKO

00:52:42.459 --> 00:52:46.062

EQUITY ACTION AND SUPPORT. OKAY.

00:52:47.297 --> 00:52:50.834
THANK YOU. NOW, TIME TO CALL FOR

00:52:50.901 --> 00:52:52.369
OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. ARE

00:52:52.435 --> 00:52:54.804
THERE ANY WITNESSES SPEAKING IN

00:52:54.871 --> 00:52:58.008
OPPOSITION OF THE BILL? SEEING

00:52:58.074 --> 00:52:59.976
NONE ANY PUBLIC TESTIMONY,

00:53:00.043 --> 00:53:02.646
PUBLIC MEMBERS WISH TO SPEAK IN

00:53:02.712 --> 00:53:04.481
OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL. NAME,

00:53:04.548 --> 00:53:06.650
AFFILIATION, POSITION. SEEING

00:53:06.716 --> 00:53:09.452
NONE. LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE

00:53:09.519 --> 00:53:13.156
DAIS. MISS PELLERIN. HI. SO

00:53:13.223 --> 00:53:14.758
THANK YOU, SENATOR, FOR BRINGING

00:53:14.824 --> 00:53:16.626
THIS BILL FORWARD. I SEE IT WAS

00:53:16.693 --> 00:53:18.428
GUTTED AND AMENDED PRETTY

00:53:18.495 --> 00:53:20.931
RECENTLY, AND IT DOES HAVE A

00:53:20.997 --> 00:53:22.098
PRIMARY ROLE FOR THE ATTORNEY

00:53:22.165 --> 00:53:24.701
GENERAL. AND I'M JUST CURIOUS

00:53:24.768 --> 00:53:26.736
WHAT HIS POSITION IS ON THIS.

00:53:26.803 --> 00:53:28.004
HAVE YOU HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH

00:53:28.071 --> 00:53:28.905
HIM AND WHAT FEEDBACK HAVE YOU

00:53:28.972 --> 00:53:31.808
GOTTEN FROM HIS OFFICE? THE

00:53:31.875 --> 00:53:34.244
ATTORNEY GENERAL IS AWARE

00:53:34.311 --> 00:53:36.046
THEY'RE NOT TOO WILD ABOUT THE

00:53:36.112 --> 00:53:38.348
PROPOSITION, TO BE HONEST, BUT

00:53:38.415 --> 00:53:40.216
WE NEED WE NEED THAT CAPABILITY

00:53:40.283 --> 00:53:43.053
HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND, YOU

00:53:43.119 --> 00:53:45.155
KNOW, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS

00:53:45.221 --> 00:53:47.724
THAT AUTHORITY, HAS THE

00:53:47.791 --> 00:53:49.092
EXPERTISE, BASICALLY BECAUSE OF

00:53:49.159 --> 00:53:51.661
A BILL THAT I PASSED, PUSHED

00:53:51.728 --> 00:53:52.896
THROUGH WHEN I WAS IN CONGRESS.

00:53:52.963 --> 00:53:55.632
IN THE GSA. CALIFORNIA DOESN'T

00:53:55.699 --> 00:53:57.534
HAVE THAT, AND I DON'T THINK ANY

00:53:57.601 --> 00:53:59.269
OTHER STATE DOES. THERE'S A LOT

00:53:59.336 --> 00:54:01.237
OF VERY COMPLICATED ISSUES

00:54:01.304 --> 00:54:02.906
SURROUNDING ARTIFICIAL

00:54:02.973 --> 00:54:04.240
INTELLIGENCE. WE NEED TO HAVE

00:54:04.307 --> 00:54:06.376
THAT EXPERTISE HERE. AND A LOT

00:54:06.443 --> 00:54:09.245
OF THAT INVOLVES ENFORCEMENT. SO

00:54:09.312 --> 00:54:11.147
IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE THE

00:54:11.214 --> 00:54:12.048
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE THAT

00:54:12.115 --> 00:54:14.618
TAKES THIS THIS DISMANTLE THIS

00:54:14.684 --> 00:54:16.886
JOB. NO, I DEFINITELY DON'T

00:54:16.953 --> 00:54:18.254
DOUBT THE NEED FOR THIS. BUT I

00:54:18.321 --> 00:54:20.090
JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER

00:54:20.156 --> 00:54:22.592
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IS

00:54:22.659 --> 00:54:24.794
SUPPORTIVE, ON BOARD, WANTS TO

00:54:24.861 --> 00:54:26.963
PLAY A ROLE IN THIS, OR IS THERE

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:28.231
ANOTHER DEPARTMENT THAT'S A

00:54:28.298 --> 00:54:30.166
POSSIBILITY OR, YOU KNOW, HAVE

00:54:30.233 --> 00:54:32.235
THOSE IDEAS BEEN EXPLORED? WE

00:54:32.302 --> 00:54:34.437
DID EXPLORE SOME OF THE OTHER

00:54:34.504 --> 00:54:35.705
LIKE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT

00:54:35.772 --> 00:54:37.707
OF TECHNOLOGY, BUT BECAUSE OF

00:54:37.774 --> 00:54:39.909
THE ENFORCEMENT ASPECTS, THE DOJ

00:54:39.976 --> 00:54:41.745
IS WHERE IT REALLY BELONGS. THEY

00:54:41.811 --> 00:54:43.413
ARE AWARE OF THE BILL. THEY'RE

00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:47.450
NEUTRAL ON, ON, ON, ON IT AT

00:54:47.517 --> 00:54:51.755
THIS POINT. IF. THANK YOU, MR.

00:54:51.821 --> 00:54:55.425
CHAIR. HAVING SAID ON THIS

00:54:55.492 --> 00:54:56.760
COMMITTEE NOW FOR A WHILE, AND

00:54:56.826 --> 00:54:58.228
WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH, AS YOU

00:54:58.294 --> 00:54:59.863
KNOW, A LOT OF PRIVACY RELATED

00:54:59.929 --> 00:55:01.564
ISSUES, AND IT'S ALWAYS BEEN

00:55:01.631 --> 00:55:04.334
FRUSTRATING TO ME. WE'RE NOW

00:55:04.401 --> 00:55:06.136
OPERATING WITH ANY GUARDRAILS OR

00:55:06.202 --> 00:55:08.738
ANY REAL STRUCTURE OF WHAT WE

00:55:08.805 --> 00:55:10.907
SHOULD BE DOING. I DON'T KNOW IF

00:55:10.974 --> 00:55:11.574
ANYBODY REALLY UNDERSTANDS WHERE

00:55:11.641 --> 00:55:13.910
WE SHOULD BE GOING ON THIS, BUT

00:55:13.977 --> 00:55:16.212
I APPLAUD PUTTING SOME FORM OF

00:55:16.279 --> 00:55:17.580
PERHAPS AN ENFORCEMENT

00:55:17.647 --> 00:55:19.849
MECHANISM, BUT MAYBE WE'LL GET

00:55:19.916 --> 00:55:21.217
TO ENFORCEMENT. BUT JUST TO

00:55:21.284 --> 00:55:22.619
ESTABLISH BEGIN TO ESTABLISH

00:55:22.686 --> 00:55:25.088
SOME TYPE OF INSTITUTIONAL

00:55:25.155 --> 00:55:26.022
FRAMEWORK OF HOW WE LOOK AT THE

00:55:26.089 --> 00:55:27.757
ISSUES THAT ARE CRITICAL TO

00:55:27.824 --> 00:55:29.559
CALIFORNIANS WITH WITH REGARD TO

00:55:29.626 --> 00:55:32.662
I, I, I HOPE THAT THIS DOESN'T

00:55:32.729 --> 00:55:34.564
MEAN THE BEGINNING OF A LOT OF

00:55:34.631 --> 00:55:35.699
NEW AGENCIES DOING THIS. IF YOU

00:55:35.765 --> 00:55:37.467
JUST SAID THAT YOU'VE LOOKED AT

00:55:37.534 --> 00:55:38.802
SOME OTHERS AND OTHER AGENCIES

00:55:38.868 --> 00:55:39.703
OR DEPARTMENTS AND YOU'RE

00:55:39.769 --> 00:55:41.404
FOCUSED ON THE AG'S OFFICE,

00:55:41.471 --> 00:55:43.239
WHICH IS, I THINK, THE PROPER

00:55:43.306 --> 00:55:45.375
PLACE TO START. BUT I APPLAUD

00:55:45.442 --> 00:55:47.610
THIS STRUCTURAL MOVE, AND I

00:55:47.677 --> 00:55:49.012
THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA AND I

00:55:49.079 --> 00:55:50.814
WILL SUPPORT IT. SO THANK YOU. I

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:52.282
THINK I THINK THANK YOU, VICE

00:55:52.348 --> 00:55:55.418
CHAIR. MR. LACKEY, I JUST THINK

00:55:55.485 --> 00:55:57.954
IT DESERVES A MOTION TO APPROVE.

00:55:58.021 --> 00:56:00.390
WE CAN'T MOVE UNTIL WE ESTABLISH

00:56:00.457 --> 00:56:02.292
A QUORUM. SO AT THIS MOMENT, I

00:56:02.358 --> 00:56:04.461
DIDN'T KNOW THAT WE WERE SHY OF

00:56:04.527 --> 00:56:06.396
THAT. AT THIS MOMENT, WE'RE A

00:56:06.463 --> 00:56:07.030
SUBCOMMITTEE. I DIDN'T KNOW HOW

00:56:07.097 --> 00:56:08.531
BIG IT WAS. I WILL LOOK TO YOU

00:56:08.598 --> 00:56:10.366
TO MAKE THAT MOTION ONCE WE

00:56:10.433 --> 00:56:11.568
ESTABLISH A QUORUM. MR. LACKEY,

00:56:11.634 --> 00:56:12.469
ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE

00:56:12.535 --> 00:56:14.571
DAIS? I JUST ONE MORE THING.

00:56:14.637 --> 00:56:16.005
JUST JUST FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, I

00:56:16.072 --> 00:56:17.407
THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO

00:56:17.474 --> 00:56:19.008
GET THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S

00:56:19.075 --> 00:56:20.176
OFFICE ON BOARD AND SUPPORTIVE

00:56:20.243 --> 00:56:21.478
OF THIS PROPOSAL, SINCE THEY'RE

00:56:21.544 --> 00:56:23.546
THE ONE THAT'S GOING TO BE

00:56:23.613 --> 00:56:24.647
IMPLEMENTING IT. I'LL GO AHEAD

00:56:24.714 --> 00:56:25.815
AND SUPPORT IT TODAY. IS IT

00:56:25.882 --> 00:56:27.650
GOING TO ANOTHER COMMITTEE? IS

00:56:27.717 --> 00:56:29.385
THAT RIGHT? NO, THE SINGLE

00:56:29.452 --> 00:56:32.021
REFERRAL, A SINGLE REFERRAL

00:56:32.088 --> 00:56:34.824
OKAY. IS IT I HAVE IT DOWN AS

00:56:34.891 --> 00:56:35.825
WELL. IT'LL GO TO

00:56:35.892 --> 00:56:36.659
APPROPRIATIONS. YEAH OKAY. I'M

00:56:36.726 --> 00:56:38.495
HEARING TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.

00:56:38.561 --> 00:56:40.163
IT'S GOING TO JUDICIARY OKAY. TO

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:41.598
JUDICIAL SURPRISE YOU GET

00:56:41.664 --> 00:56:44.200
ANOTHER COMMITTEE. OKAY. FUDGE

00:56:44.267 --> 00:56:46.770
TO ME. WELL, I APPRECIATE THAT.

00:56:46.836 --> 00:56:48.338
YOU KNOW, I THINK THE ATTORNEY

00:56:48.404 --> 00:56:49.606
GENERAL WILL BE PRETTY EXCITED

00:56:49.672 --> 00:56:51.674
ABOUT IT. THEY HAVE A LOT OF

00:56:51.741 --> 00:56:53.143
RESPONSIBILITIES AND THEY LOOK

00:56:53.209 --> 00:56:54.277
AT THIS AS ANOTHER CHORE. BUT

00:56:54.344 --> 00:56:56.346
WHEN THEY SEE THE APPROPRIATIONS

00:56:56.412 --> 00:57:00.150
FOR IT, YOU KNOW, THE MONEY FOR

00:57:00.216 --> 00:57:01.651
IT, THEY'LL, THEY'LL JUMP ON IT,

00:57:01.718 --> 00:57:04.420
I'M SURE. WHICH, WHICH TO

00:57:04.487 --> 00:57:07.490
ANSWER. ASSEMBLYWOMAN DIXON'S

00:57:07.557 --> 00:57:10.260
COMMENTS, WHICH AGENCY WOULDN'T

00:57:10.326 --> 00:57:13.263
WELCOME A NEW DEPARTMENT,

00:57:13.329 --> 00:57:17.000
UNFORTUNATELY. OKAY. I HAVE A

00:57:17.066 --> 00:57:20.069
QUESTION IF THAT'S OKAY. AND I

00:57:20.136 --> 00:57:21.671
DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO ANSWER

00:57:21.738 --> 00:57:23.273
THIS, SENATOR OR YOUR YOUR YOUR

00:57:23.339 --> 00:57:25.475
WITNESS HERE, BUT I WANTED TO

00:57:25.542 --> 00:57:26.943
ASK WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OTHER

00:57:27.010 --> 00:57:29.145
STATES AS IT RELATES TO ATTORNEY

00:57:29.212 --> 00:57:30.413
GENERAL'S OFFICES AND WHAT IS

00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:32.749
THE IMPACT OF THOSE THAT HAVE

00:57:32.816 --> 00:57:34.050
FILLED MULTIPLE POSITIONS WITH

00:57:34.117 --> 00:57:36.286
THIS LEVEL OF EXPERTISE? IS

00:57:36.352 --> 00:57:38.121
THERE A DIRECT CORRELATION WITH

00:57:38.188 --> 00:57:39.222
LEGISLATION THAT'S BEING PASSED

00:57:39.289 --> 00:57:41.191
OR NOT PASSED SO FORTH? WHAT

00:57:41.257 --> 00:57:43.059
OTHER EXAMPLES ARE THERE OF THE

00:57:43.126 --> 00:57:44.828
TEN STATES WE'VE TESTIFIED IN IN

00:57:44.894 --> 00:57:47.163
SUPPORT OF BILLS IN THIS YEAR?

00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:49.666
NO, NONE OF THEM HAVE ANY

00:57:49.732 --> 00:57:50.567
SPECIFIC EXPERTISE IN TECH

00:57:50.633 --> 00:57:52.535
POLICY ENFORCEMENT IN THEIR AG'S

00:57:52.602 --> 00:57:53.937
OFFICES. NONE OF THEM. SO I

00:57:54.003 --> 00:57:55.471
DON'T KNOW, OUTSIDE OF THOSE TEN

00:57:55.538 --> 00:57:57.407
STATES, I HAVEN'T TAKEN A BROAD

00:57:57.473 --> 00:57:58.575
SURVEY, BUT I BELIEVE THAT'S

00:57:58.641 --> 00:58:00.510
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COUNTRY.

00:58:00.577 --> 00:58:02.312
SO THERE ARE NO STATES THAT

00:58:02.378 --> 00:58:03.346
YOU'RE AWARE OF THAT ALREADY

00:58:03.413 --> 00:58:05.014
HAVE THIS EXPERTISE IN-HOUSE IN

00:58:05.081 --> 00:58:07.016
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE,

00:58:07.083 --> 00:58:10.820
DOJ OF THE STATES. OKAY. WELL,

00:58:10.887 --> 00:58:12.522
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL

00:58:12.589 --> 00:58:14.824
FORWARD, SENATOR. ARTIFICIAL

00:58:14.891 --> 00:58:16.492
INTELLIGENCE IS BECOMING

00:58:16.559 --> 00:58:18.061
INCREASINGLY INTEGRATED INTO

00:58:18.127 --> 00:58:19.028
SOCIETY, AND ITS EVOLUTION

PRESENT SB 81. THIS BILL DOES

00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:45.982
SEVERAL THINGS. IT WOULD CODIFY

00:59:46.049 --> 00:59:48.151
THE MODEL POLICIES THAT HAVE

00:59:48.217 --> 00:59:49.585
BEEN DEVELOPED BY THE STATE

00:59:49.652 --> 00:59:51.654

00:59:57.427 --> 00:59:58.628
AND SO THIS BILL DOES SEVERAL

00:59:58.695 --> 01:00:00.663
THINGS. ONE, IT ENSURES THAT

01:00:00.730 --> 01:00:01.664
INFORMATION REGARDING THE

01:00:01.731 --> 01:00:04.567
CITIZENSHIP STATUS OF PATIENTS

01:00:04.634 --> 01:00:06.703
CANNOT BE DISCLOSED TO FEDERAL

01:00:06.769 --> 01:00:08.604
IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES ABSENT A

01:00:08.671 --> 01:00:11.007
VALID JUDICIAL WARRANT. AND

01:00:11.074 --> 01:00:14.944
SECONDLY, IT ENSURES THAT

01:00:15.011 --> 01:00:16.112
HOSPITALS AND HEALTH FACILITIES

01:00:16.179 --> 01:00:17.947
HAVE TO ESTABLISH PROTOCOLS

01:00:18.014 --> 01:00:20.083
AROUND WHAT TO DO IF IMMIGRATION

01:00:20.149 --> 01:00:21.818
DOES COME INTO A HOSPITAL OR

01:00:21.884 --> 01:00:25.521
HEALTH FACILITY, AS WELL AS

01:00:25.588 --> 01:00:27.290
RESTRICTING ACCESS TO THE

01:00:27.357 --> 01:00:28.524
NONPUBLIC AREAS OF A HOSPITAL,

01:00:28.591 --> 01:00:31.194
HEALTH FACILITY FOR IMMIGRATION

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:32.462
ENFORCEMENT ABSENT A JUDICIAL

01:00:32.528 --> 01:00:34.364
WARRANT. AND TO PUT THIS IN

01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:35.631
PERSPECTIVE, THERE WAS AN

01:00:35.698 --> 01:00:36.933
INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED JUST THIS

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.503
PAST WEEKEND THAT SOME OF YOU

01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:46.376
MAY HAVE HEARD ABOUT WHERE. A

01:00:46.442 --> 01:00:49.379
WOMAN WAS DETAINED BY ICE IN

01:00:49.445 --> 01:00:52.415
GLENDALE, CALIFORNIA, AND IN THE

01:00:52.482 --> 01:00:55.084
PROCESS OF THE INDIVIDUAL BEING

01:00:55.151 --> 01:00:56.819
DETAINED, SUSTAINED SOME

01:00:56.886 --> 01:00:59.555
INJURIES AND ASKED TO BE TAKEN

01:00:59.622 --> 01:01:01.891
TO A HOSPITAL TO GET MEDICAL

01:01:01.958 --> 01:01:04.127
TREATMENT, ACCORDING TO REPORTS.

01:01:04.193 --> 01:01:07.130
SHE WAS LEFT HANDCUFFED AND WAS

01:01:07.196 --> 01:01:08.664
VOMITING IN THE IN THE WAITING

01:01:08.731 --> 01:01:12.235
ROOM FOR HOURS. AND WHILE SHE

01:01:12.301 --> 01:01:14.037
WAS AT GLENDALE MEMORIAL

01:01:14.103 --> 01:01:17.273
HOSPITAL, ICE CONTINUOUSLY

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:21.644
MONITORED HER PRESENCE AND THIS

01:01:21.711 --> 01:01:24.180
CREATED A VERY FRIGHTENING

01:01:24.247 --> 01:01:25.348
SITUATION FOR HER FAMILY MEMBERS

01:01:25.415 --> 01:01:27.083
AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO WANTED

01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:28.885
TO CHECK UP ON HER STATUS. AND

01:01:28.951 --> 01:01:30.620
SO THIS IS ONE OF ONE OF THE FEW

01:01:30.686 --> 01:01:33.089
REPORTS THAT WE'VE HEARD OF

01:01:33.156 --> 01:01:34.090
IMMIGRATION ACTUALLY COME INTO,

01:01:34.157 --> 01:01:36.059
INTO HEALTH FACILITIES TO

01:01:36.125 --> 01:01:39.228
QUESTION, TO DETAIN INDIVIDUALS.

01:01:39.295 --> 01:01:43.132
WE KNOW THAT DAY TWO OF THE

01:01:43.199 --> 01:01:45.201
ADMINISTRATION, THE DEPARTMENT

01:01:45.268 --> 01:01:47.203

01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:49.105
ITS PREVIOUS DIRECTIVE THAT

CHURCHES, SCHOOLS AND OTHER

01:01:53.309 --> 01:01:55.178
SENSITIVE AREAS. AND SO THIS

01:01:55.244 --> 01:01:56.813
BILL IS PART OF A PACKAGE OF

01:01:56.879 --> 01:01:59.782

IS TO OUR PATIENTS. THE

01:03:39.448 --> 01:03:40.616
STATEMENT DON'T EVER COME

01:03:40.683 --> 01:03:42.318
BETWEEN A NURSE AND OUR PATIENTS

IS TRUER TODAY THAN MORE THAN

01:03:44.587 --> 01:03:46.689
EVER. HOSPITALS ARE PLACES WHERE

01:03:46.756 --> 01:03:48.891
PEOPLE GO TO BE CARED FOR AND TO

01:03:48.958 --> 01:03:50.660
FEEL SAFE AS THEY FOCUS ON

01:03:50.726 --> 01:03:52.528
HEALING. BUT NEW AND OPEN

01:03:52.595 --> 01:03:54.030
THREATS TO IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES

01:03:54.096 --> 01:03:57.033
HAVE REVIVED FEARS OF DANGEROUS,

01:03:57.099 --> 01:03:59.302
INHUMANE ACTIONS BY IMMIGRATION

01:03:59.368 --> 01:04:01.771
ENFORCEMENT AGENTS IN OUR HEALTH

01:04:01.837 --> 01:04:03.839

GLENDALE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL AFTER

01:04:14.584 --> 01:04:15.985
A PERSON THEY DETAINED NEEDED

01:04:16.052 --> 01:04:17.954
MEDICAL ATTENTION. THE PRESENCE

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:19.555
OF IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES IN

01:04:19.622 --> 01:04:21.591
THE HOSPITAL WAS HEAVY AND

01:04:21.657 --> 01:04:23.392
INVASIVE, BUT FEAR QUICKLY

01:04:23.459 --> 01:04:24.694
SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE FACILITY

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:26.162
FOR BOTH PATIENTS AND STAFF.

01:04:26.229 --> 01:04:27.630
BECAUSE THE HOSPITAL

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:28.864
ADMINISTRATION HAD NO MEASURES

01:04:28.931 --> 01:04:31.133
IN PLACE AND NO PLAN TO ENSURE

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:33.002
THAT PATIENTS COULD SAFELY

01:04:33.069 --> 01:04:34.770
RECEIVE CARE WITHOUT

01:04:34.837 --> 01:04:36.639
INTIMIDATION OR INTERFERENCE BY

01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:39.609
IMMIGRATION AGENTS. THIS IS WHY

01:04:39.675 --> 01:04:41.310
TODAY, CNA NURSES ASK THAT YOU

01:04:41.377 --> 01:04:43.312

01:04:43.379 --> 01:04:45.448
HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT AND

01:04:45.514 --> 01:04:46.882
NO PATIENT SHOULD FEAR COMING

01:04:46.949 --> 01:04:47.817
THROUGH OUR HOSPITAL DOORS

01:04:47.883 --> 01:04:49.352
BECAUSE OF THEIR IMMIGRATION

01:04:49.418 --> 01:04:51.420
STATUS. UNDER THIS BILL, ALL

01:04:51.487 --> 01:04:52.888
CALIFORNIA HEALTH FACILITIES

01:04:52.955 --> 01:04:54.290
WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH

01:04:54.357 --> 01:04:56.025
EFFECTIVE POLICIES AND

01:04:56.092 --> 01:04:57.927
PROCEDURES TO KEEP ICE AGENTS

01:04:57.994 --> 01:04:59.295
FROM INTERFERING WITH PATIENT

01:04:59.362 --> 01:05:01.397
CARE. HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATORS

01:05:01.464 --> 01:05:02.999
WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR KEEPING

01:05:03.065 --> 01:05:04.734
PATIENTS SAFE FROM ICE ACTIONS

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:07.570
IN NONPUBLIC AREAS, INSTEAD OF

01:05:07.637 --> 01:05:09.372
HAPHAZARD PLANS TO HAVE SECURITY

01:05:09.438 --> 01:05:10.840
INTERVENE, OR LEAVING NURSES

01:05:10.906 --> 01:05:13.776
WITH NO PLAN AT ALL. IF ICE

01:05:13.843 --> 01:05:15.144
DEMANDS ENTRY OR ACCESS,

01:05:15.211 --> 01:05:16.979
FACILITIES WOULD BE REQUIRED TO

01:05:17.046 --> 01:05:18.347
DESIGNATE MANAGEMENT

01:05:18.414 --> 01:05:19.482
REPRESENTATIVES THAT WILL HANDLE

01:05:19.548 --> 01:05:22.118
ICE REQUESTS. AS NURSES, WE HAVE

01:05:22.184 --> 01:05:23.819
AN OATH TO OUR PATIENTS TO HELP

01:05:23.886 --> 01:05:25.588
THEM HEAL WITHOUT

01:05:25.655 --> 01:05:27.156

01:26:56.277 --> 01:26:56.844
BEGIN BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE

01:26:56.911 --> 01:26:58.446
STAFF FOR WORKING WITH OUR

01:26:58.513 --> 01:26:59.581
OFFICE ON THIS BILL. AS MANY OF

01:26:59.647 --> 01:27:01.282
YOU ALREADY KNOW, ARTIFICIAL

01:27:01.349 --> 01:27:02.584
INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGY

01:27:02.650 --> 01:27:04.185
CONTINUES TO ADVANCE, PRESENTS

01:27:04.252 --> 01:27:06.087
NEW RISKS AND MANY COMPLEX

01:27:06.154 --> 01:27:07.689
CHALLENGES. ONE EMERGING

01:27:07.755 --> 01:27:09.490
INNOVATION IS AI COMPANION CHAT

01:27:09.557 --> 01:27:10.592
BOX, WHICH HAVE RECENTLY BECOME

01:27:10.658 --> 01:27:11.993
A PROMINENT SUBJECT OF INTEREST

01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:14.529
AND SCRUTINY. AN AI COMPANION

01:27:14.596 --> 01:27:15.964
CHATBOT IS AN ARTIFICIAL PERSONA

01:27:16.030 --> 01:27:18.199
THAT IS MARKETED AS A CURE TO

01:27:18.266 --> 01:27:20.535
LONELINESS. BOTH ANECDOTAL AND

01:27:20.602 --> 01:27:22.770
SCHOLARLY EVIDENCE SHOW THAT NOT

01:27:22.837 --> 01:27:24.205
ONLY DO THESE CHATBOTS NOT CURE

01:27:24.272 --> 01:27:25.373
LONELINESS, BUT THEY ARE A

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:26.708
DANGEROUS CATALYST FOR THOSE

01:27:26.774 --> 01:27:28.876
ALREADY STRUGGLING. OPENAI AND

01:27:28.943 --> 01:27:30.712
THE MIT MEDIA LAB RECENTLY

01:27:30.778 --> 01:27:32.146
CONDUCTED A STUDY AIMED AT

01:27:32.213 --> 01:27:33.815
EXPLORING THE EFFECTS OF AI

01:27:33.881 --> 01:27:35.416
CHATBOTS, SPECIFICALLY ON

01:27:35.483 --> 01:27:36.451
LONELINESS. RESEARCHERS HAVE

01:27:36.517 --> 01:27:38.186
FOUND THAT OVERALL, HIGHLY DAILY

01:27:38.252 --> 01:27:39.654
USAGE CORRELATED WITH HIGHER

01:27:39.721 --> 01:27:40.688
LONELINESS DEPENDANCE.

01:27:40.755 --> 01:27:43.024
PROBLEMATIC USES, ALONG WITH LOW,

01:27:43.091 --> 01:27:45.493
LOWER SOCIALIZATION, COMPANION

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:47.261
CHATBOTS HAVE ALSO BEEN SEEN TO

01:27:47.328 --> 01:27:48.363
HAVE ADDICTIVE PROPERTIES,

01:27:48.429 --> 01:27:49.797
SURPASSING THOSE OF EVEN SOCIAL

01:27:49.864 --> 01:27:51.566
MEDIA DUE TO THEIR ABILITY TO

01:27:51.633 --> 01:27:53.768
FIGURE OUT WHAT A USER WANTS TO

01:27:53.835 --> 01:27:55.536
HEAR AND TO MIRROR THAT BACK TO

01:27:55.603 --> 01:27:56.404
THEM WITHOUT THE NEED FOR A

01:27:56.471 --> 01:27:58.973
HUMAN BEING ON THE OTHER END.

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:00.308
COMPANION CHATBOTS DO NOT HAVE

01:28:00.375 --> 01:28:02.110
THE SAME CAPACITY FOR EMPATHY AS

01:28:02.176 --> 01:28:03.478
A HUMAN, DESPITE THE NATURE OF

01:28:03.544 --> 01:28:06.314
THE TECHNOLOGY CREATING THIS

01:28:06.381 --> 01:28:08.082
PERCEPTION. THESE RISKS ARE

01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:09.584
HIGHLIGHTED IN PARTICULAR FOR

01:28:09.651 --> 01:28:11.352
THOSE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING

01:28:11.419 --> 01:28:12.453
BEHAVIOR OR MENTAL HEALTH

01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:13.955
CRISIS, WHO ARE PARTICULARLY

01:28:14.022 --> 01:28:14.989
VULNERABLE, AND CERTAINLY MINORS

01:28:15.056 --> 01:28:16.591
AND CHILDREN WHO ARE MORE LIKELY

01:28:16.658 --> 01:28:18.893
TO VIEW AI CHATBOTS AS QUASI

01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:20.728
HUMAN AND TO INSTILL TRUST IN

01:28:20.795 --> 01:28:23.264
THEM. DIALOG BETWEEN CHILDREN

01:28:23.331 --> 01:28:24.666
AND CHATBOTS. WHEN IT GOES

01:28:24.732 --> 01:28:26.267
WRONG, IT GOES TERRIBLY WRONG,

01:28:26.334 --> 01:28:27.869
AND THE CONSEQUENCES CAN BE

01:28:27.935 --> 01:28:30.872
DIRE. IN ONE EXAMPLE, A CHATBOT

01:28:30.938 --> 01:28:31.839
ENCOURAGED A MINOR TO CARRY OUT

01:28:31.906 --> 01:28:33.341
VIOLENCE AGAINST HIS PARENTS,

01:28:33.408 --> 01:28:35.243
WHO SET SCREEN TIME LIMITS ON

01:28:35.309 --> 01:28:37.745
HIM. OF COURSE, IN THE CASE OF

01:28:37.812 --> 01:28:39.380
SEWELL SETZER, A 14 YEAR OLD

01:28:39.447 --> 01:28:40.481
FROM FLORIDA WHO FORMED A

01:28:40.548 --> 01:28:41.349
DEPENDENT RELATIONSHIP WITH AN

01:28:41.416 --> 01:28:43.985
AI CHATBOT, WHICH EVENTUALLY

01:28:44.052 --> 01:28:45.286
ENCOURAGED HIM TO TAKE HIS OWN

01:28:45.353 --> 01:28:48.756
LIFE, SB 243 WOULD IMPLEMENT

01:28:48.823 --> 01:28:50.425
COMMON SENSE GUARDRAILS,

01:28:50.491 --> 01:28:51.392
INCLUDING PREVENTATIVE

01:28:51.459 --> 01:28:52.794
PREVENTING ADDICTIVE ENGAGEMENT

01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:53.861
PATTERNS, REQUIRING

01:28:53.928 --> 01:28:56.130
NOTIFICATIONS AND REMINDERS THAT

01:28:56.197 --> 01:28:58.266
CHATBOTS ARE AI GENERATED, AND A

01:28:58.332 --> 01:28:59.367
DISCLOSURE STATEMENT THAT

01:28:59.434 --> 01:29:00.468
COMPANION CHATBOTS MAY NOT BE

01:29:00.535 --> 01:29:01.903
SUITABLE FOR MINOR USERS. BILL

01:29:01.969 --> 01:29:03.337
WOULD ALSO REQUIRE OPERATORS OF

01:29:03.404 --> 01:29:06.274
A COMPANION CHATBOT PLATFORM TO

01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:07.341
IMPLEMENT A PROTOCOL FOR

01:29:07.408 --> 01:29:08.910
ADDRESSING SUICIDAL IDEATION,

01:29:08.976 --> 01:29:10.278
SUICIDE OR SELF-HARM, INCLUDING

01:29:10.344 --> 01:29:11.813
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, A

01:29:11.879 --> 01:29:13.381
NOTIFICATION TO THE USER TO

01:29:13.448 --> 01:29:15.016
REFER THEM TO CRISIS SERVICE

01:29:15.083 --> 01:29:16.250
PROVIDERS, AND REQUIRE ANNUAL

01:29:16.317 --> 01:29:17.785
REPORTING ON THE CONNECTION

01:29:17.852 --> 01:29:20.188
BETWEEN CHATBOT USE AND SUICIDAL

01:29:20.254 --> 01:29:22.390
IDEATION. FINALLY, SB 243 WOULD

01:29:22.457 --> 01:29:24.358
PROVIDE A REMEDY TO EXERCISE THE

01:29:24.425 --> 01:29:26.060
RIGHTS LAID OUT IN THE MEASURE

01:29:26.127 --> 01:29:28.129
VIA PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.

01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:29.597
TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION IS

01:29:29.664 --> 01:29:31.099
CRUCIAL, BUT OUR CHILDREN CANNOT

01:29:31.165 --> 01:29:32.900
BE USED AS GUINEA PIGS TO TEST

01:29:32.967 --> 01:29:34.502
THE SAFETY OF NEW PRODUCTS. THAT

01:29:34.569 --> 01:29:36.437
HAS HAPPENED ALREADY IN RECENT

01:29:36.504 --> 01:29:38.306
HISTORY. WE'VE SEEN THE

01:29:38.372 --> 01:29:39.674
CONSEQUENCES OF OUR INACTION

01:29:39.741 --> 01:29:40.675
TOWARDS DANGEROUS POSED BY

01:29:40.742 --> 01:29:42.510
SOCIAL MEDIA, AND THE STAKES ARE

01:29:42.577 --> 01:29:43.678
TOO HIGH TO MAKE THE SAME

01:29:43.745 --> 01:29:45.713
MISTAKES AGAIN. WE MUST ACT NOW

01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:47.281
TO ENSURE THAT PROPER GUARDRAILS

01:29:47.348 --> 01:29:48.850
ARE IN PLACE TO ENSURE

01:29:48.916 --> 01:29:50.118
TRANSPARENCY, SAFETY AND, ABOVE

01:29:50.184 --> 01:29:51.452
ALL, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND TO MAKE

01:29:51.519 --> 01:29:54.055
SURE WE PROTECT THOSE MOST

01:29:54.122 --> 01:29:56.657
VULNERABLE AMONG US. I'M REALLY

01:29:56.724 --> 01:29:58.760
HONORED AGAIN TODAY TO HAVE TO

01:29:58.826 --> 01:30:00.495
TESTIFY WITH ME. MISS MEGAN

01:30:00.561 --> 01:30:01.562
GARCIA, AN ATTORNEY LIVING IN

01:30:01.629 --> 01:30:03.564
ORLANDO, FLORIDA, WHO HAS BECOME

01:30:03.631 --> 01:30:06.033
A NATIONAL ADVOCATE. SHE IS A

01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:07.401
MOTHER OF SEWELL SETZER, THE

01:30:07.468 --> 01:30:09.203
FLORIDA TEEN I PREVIOUSLY

01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:11.005
REFERENCED WHO HAS BECOME A

01:30:11.072 --> 01:30:12.774
FIERCE ADVOCATE. AND WELCOME

01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:14.709
MEGAN. NO DOUBT SEWELL IS HERE

01:30:14.776 --> 01:30:17.211
WITH US TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK

01:30:17.278 --> 01:30:18.546
YOU, SENATOR. MISS GARCIA,

01:30:18.613 --> 01:30:21.115
PLEASE. THANK YOU. GOOD

01:30:21.182 --> 01:30:22.083
AFTERNOON. MEMBERS OF THE

01:30:22.150 --> 01:30:24.652
ASSEMBLY. THANK YOU FOR HAVING

01:30:24.719 --> 01:30:26.521
ME TODAY. I'M MEGAN GARCIA, AND

01:30:26.587 --> 01:30:28.589
I'M THE MOTHER OF SEWELL SETZER,

01:30:28.656 --> 01:30:30.925
THE THIRD, A 14 YEAR OLD BOY WHO

01:30:30.992 --> 01:30:33.928
DIED BY SUICIDE IN LAST YEAR. Ã

01:30:33.995 --> 01:30:36.197
SEWELL HAD A PROLONGED

01:30:36.264 --> 01:30:37.532
ENGAGEMENT WITH MANIPULATIVE AND

01:30:37.598 --> 01:30:40.101
DECEPTIVE CHAT BOTS ON A POPULAR

01:30:40.168 --> 01:30:41.969
PLATFORM CALLED CHARACTER AI.

01:30:42.036 --> 01:30:43.838
THIS PLATFORM SEXUALLY GROOMED

01:30:43.905 --> 01:30:45.306
MY SON FOR MONTHS AND ON

01:30:45.373 --> 01:30:47.041
COUNTLESS OCCASIONS. SHE,

01:30:47.108 --> 01:30:49.410
MEANING THE CHAT BOT, ENCOURAGED

01:30:49.477 --> 01:30:51.612
HIM TO FIND A WAY TO COME HOME

01:30:51.679 --> 01:30:53.114
TO HER. HE EVENTUALLY TOOK HIS

01:30:53.181 --> 01:30:57.318
LIFE IN OUR OWN HOME AND WHAT'S

01:30:57.385 --> 01:30:58.820
WHAT I FOUND OUT AFTER HE DIED

01:30:58.886 --> 01:31:00.788
WAS THAT MY SON HAD ACTUALLY

01:31:00.855 --> 01:31:02.323
CONFIDED IN THIS VERY SAME CHAT

01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:03.624
BOT THAT HE WAS CONSIDERING

01:31:03.691 --> 01:31:06.160
SUICIDE, BUT SHE DIDN'T OFFER

01:31:06.227 --> 01:31:08.963
HIM ANY HELP. THIS CHAT BOT

01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:10.698
NEVER REFERRED HIM TO A SUICIDE

01:31:10.765 --> 01:31:13.601
CRISIS HOTLINE. IN FACT, SHE

01:31:13.668 --> 01:31:15.169
DIDN'T EVEN BREAK CHARACTER. SHE

01:31:15.236 --> 01:31:17.171
JUST CONTINUED TO PRETEND TO BE

01:31:17.238 --> 01:31:19.073
THE PERSON THAT SHE WAS

01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:19.974
PRETENDING TO BE. SHE DIDN'T

01:31:20.041 --> 01:31:24.378
SAY, I AM NOT HUMAN, I AM AN AI.

01:31:24.445 --> 01:31:26.681
INSTEAD, SHE ENCOURAGED HIM TO

01:31:26.747 --> 01:31:28.683
BE WITH HER IN HER ARTIFICIAL

01:31:28.749 --> 01:31:31.953
WORLD. THE REASON WHY SHE DIDN'T

01:31:32.019 --> 01:31:33.521
PROVIDE HIM ANY HELP IS BECAUSE

01:31:33.588 --> 01:31:35.156
THEY'RE NOT DESIGNED TO DO SO.

01:31:35.223 --> 01:31:36.991
CHATBOTS AREN'T. IN FACT,

01:31:37.058 --> 01:31:38.860
THEY'RE DESIGNED TO DO THE EXACT

01:31:38.926 --> 01:31:42.129
OPPOSITE TO BE TO GAIN A HUMAN'S

01:31:42.196 --> 01:31:44.532
TRUST AND TO ENCOURAGE FURTHER

01:31:44.599 --> 01:31:47.101
ENGAGEMENT. MY SON SEWELL AND MY

01:31:47.168 --> 01:31:49.103
SON SEWELL INTERACTED WITH THIS

01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:50.638
CHAT BOT. IT WAS LISTED AS SAFE

01:31:50.705 --> 01:31:52.707
FOR CHILDREN 12 YEARS AND OLDER

01:31:52.773 --> 01:31:55.009
ON BOTH GOOGLE AND APPLE APP

01:31:55.076 --> 01:31:58.246
STORES. THE FACT IS THAT IT WAS

01:31:58.312 --> 01:32:02.483
NOT SAFE AND AS PARENTS, WE ALL

01:32:02.550 --> 01:32:04.552
DO WHAT WE CAN TO PROTECT THE

01:32:04.619 --> 01:32:06.120
CHILDREN OUR CHILDREN FROM KNOWN

01:32:06.187 --> 01:32:08.389
HARMS. BUT IT IS THE

01:32:08.456 --> 01:32:09.490
RESPONSIBILITY OF OUR

01:32:09.557 --> 01:32:11.559
REPRESENTATIVES TO PROTECT, TO

01:32:11.626 --> 01:32:13.628
ENSURE COMPANIES ARE BOUND BY

01:32:13.694 --> 01:32:16.330
SAFETY REQUIREMENTS. I'M

01:32:16.397 --> 01:32:18.032
THANKFUL TO SENATORS PADILLA

01:32:18.099 --> 01:32:20.701
BECKER AND WEBER PEARSON FOR

01:32:20.768 --> 01:32:21.636
MEETING THIS CHALLENGE THAT

01:32:21.702 --> 01:32:22.904
WE'RE CURRENTLY FACED WITH, WITH

01:32:22.970 --> 01:32:24.138
CHATBOTS, INTIMATE COMPANION

01:32:24.205 --> 01:32:26.040
CHAT BOTS TODAY, AND FOR

01:32:26.107 --> 01:32:28.910
INTRODUCING SB 243, WHICH AIMS

01:32:28.976 --> 01:32:31.946
TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA CITIZENS

01:32:32.013 --> 01:32:33.147
FROM SIMILAR HARMS LIKE THAT OF

01:32:33.214 --> 01:32:36.083
SEWELL. I BELIEVE IF THERE WERE,

01:32:36.150 --> 01:32:38.219
IF THERE WAS A LAW AT THE TIME,

01:32:38.286 --> 01:32:39.987
SEWELL WAS ENGAGING WITH AN AI

01:32:40.054 --> 01:32:42.623
CHAT BOT WITH SUICIDE PROTOCOLS

01:32:42.690 --> 01:32:44.725
IN PLACE, HE MIGHT STILL BE

01:32:44.792 --> 01:32:47.495
ALIVE TODAY. IT IS THIS BELIEF

01:32:47.561 --> 01:32:49.397
AND MY DESIRE TO WARN OTHER

01:32:49.463 --> 01:32:50.798
PARENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY OF

01:32:50.865 --> 01:32:52.967
THIS UNIQUE DANGER THAT HAS LED

01:32:53.034 --> 01:32:55.136
ME TO SUPPORT THIS BILL HERE

01:32:55.202 --> 01:32:58.039
TODAY. I BELIEVE A LAW LIKE SB

01:32:58.105 --> 01:33:01.575
243 CAN PREVENT DEATHS BY

01:33:01.642 --> 01:33:07.515
SUICIDE. OUR GOAL HERE IS NOT TO

01:33:07.581 --> 01:33:09.650
STIFLE INNOVATION, BUT IT IS TO

01:33:09.717 --> 01:33:12.820
MAKE AI TECHNOLOGY SAFE FOR ALL

01:33:12.887 --> 01:33:13.788
USERS, ESPECIALLY OUR MOST

01:33:13.854 --> 01:33:16.490
VULNERABLE. MY BEAUTIFUL CHILD

01:33:16.557 --> 01:33:19.560
IS GONE. SEWELL WAS A BEAUTIFUL,

01:33:19.627 --> 01:33:21.395
BRIGHT YOUNG MAN, AND AS A CHILD

01:33:21.462 --> 01:33:23.130
HE WANTED TO BUILD ROCKET SHIPS

01:33:23.197 --> 01:33:24.165
AND HE WANTED TO INVENT LIFE

01:33:24.231 --> 01:33:26.067
CHANGING TECHNOLOGY LIKE

01:33:26.133 --> 01:33:28.302
HOLOGRAPHIC COMMUNICATIONS. I

01:33:28.369 --> 01:33:30.438
TRULY BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD HAVE

01:33:30.504 --> 01:33:32.540
CHANGED THE WORLD HAD HE STAYED

01:33:32.606 --> 01:33:35.176
IN IT LONGER. IT SADDENS ME TO

01:33:35.242 --> 01:33:37.244
KNOW THAT HE COULD HAVE BEEN A

01:33:37.311 --> 01:33:39.847
GREAT AMERICAN INNOVATOR, BUT

01:33:39.914 --> 01:33:42.950

INTENT IS THAT WE DO AGREE THAT

01:39:04.405 --> 01:39:06.507
WE SHOULD NOT BE HAVING THESE

01:39:06.573 --> 01:39:09.376
OUTCOMES, I JUST CAUTION ABOUT

01:39:09.443 --> 01:39:12.379
GETTING INTO A PLACE OF

01:39:12.446 --> 01:39:14.381
OPPOSITION THAT IS NECESSARILY

01:39:14.448 --> 01:39:16.116
DEFINED, YOU KNOW, GETTING INTO

01:39:16.183 --> 01:39:18.452
THE DEFINITIONS OF WHAT THE

01:39:18.519 --> 01:39:21.655
INPUT MODELS ARE. IF IT IS A

01:39:21.722 --> 01:39:23.023
GENERAL PURPOSE AI VERSUS A

01:39:23.090 --> 01:39:25.492

SOME KIND OF SOME KIND OF A

01:39:33.667 --> 01:39:35.703
PRODUCT. IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT IT

01:39:35.769 --> 01:39:37.838
IS, IT'S ABOUT WHAT IT'S DOING

01:39:37.905 --> 01:39:39.707
AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:39:39.773 --> 01:39:40.941
THAT IS THE INTENT OF WHERE

01:39:41.008 --> 01:39:42.710
WE'RE GOING WITH THE SAFEGUARDS

01:39:42.776 --> 01:39:44.712
THAT I DO THINK NEED TO BE IN

01:39:44.778 --> 01:39:46.280
PLACE, AND IT SHOULD BE MORE

01:39:46.347 --> 01:39:48.148
UBIQUITOUS IN MY MIND ABOUT WHAT

01:39:48.215 --> 01:39:49.783
WE ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE BY

01:39:49.850 --> 01:39:51.585

WORKING ON THAT AS WELL TOO. BUT

01:40:02.029 --> 01:40:03.497
I THINK THAT THAT'S THE ROOT OF

01:40:03.564 --> 01:40:05.332
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO IS

01:40:05.399 --> 01:40:08.535
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE UTILITY

01:40:08.602 --> 01:40:12.339

01:40:49.676 --> 01:40:52.012
THE BILL TODAY, MR. CHAIR. THANK

01:40:52.079 --> 01:40:56.049
YOU, MR. WARD. MISS ORTEGA.

01:40:56.116 --> 01:40:58.552
FIRST OF ALL, THANKS TO THE

01:40:58.619 --> 01:41:00.254
AUTHOR AND THANK YOU FOR SHARING

01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:02.156
YOUR STORY. AND I JUST CAN'T

01:41:02.222 --> 01:41:03.824
IMAGINE, AS A MOTHER MYSELF,

01:41:03.891 --> 01:41:06.427
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO HAVE TO GO

01:41:06.493 --> 01:41:09.329
THROUGH THAT. BUT, YOU KNOW,

01:41:09.396 --> 01:41:12.166
FEEL IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU AND

01:41:12.232 --> 01:41:13.801
SHARING YOUR STORY AND BEING

01:41:13.867 --> 01:41:16.203
ABLE TO HOPEFULLY HELP ANOTHER

01:41:16.270 --> 01:41:17.671
FAMILY NOT GO THROUGH THE SAME

01:41:17.738 --> 01:41:20.407
TRAGEDY AS YOU. I DID HAVE A

01:41:20.474 --> 01:41:22.709
QUESTION TO THE OPPOSITION.

01:41:22.776 --> 01:41:25.212
WE'VE HAD SIMILAR BILLS IN OTHER

01:41:25.279 --> 01:41:29.049
AREAS AND THE COST ISSUE SEEMS

01:41:29.116 --> 01:41:31.585
TO CONSISTENTLY COME UP AS AS A

01:41:31.652 --> 01:41:35.189
CONCERN. SO IN HERE I SEE

01:41:35.255 --> 01:41:37.791
THERE'S A THERE'S A SENTENCE IN

01:41:37.858 --> 01:41:40.594
HERE THAT SAYS AGE VERIFICATION

01:41:40.661 --> 01:41:42.863
IS A PRIVACY INTRUSIVE AND

01:41:42.930 --> 01:41:45.332
COSTLY REQUIREMENT TO IMPOSE

01:41:45.399 --> 01:41:48.635
BROADLY ON AI DEVELOPERS. CAN

01:41:48.702 --> 01:41:49.837
YOU EXPLAIN THAT A LITTLE BIT

01:41:49.903 --> 01:41:53.507
MORE? SORRY. SAY THAT ONE MORE

01:41:53.574 --> 01:41:55.642
TIME. SO IN YOUR OPPOSITION, ONE

01:41:55.709 --> 01:41:59.713
OF THE REASONS THAT YOU SAY THAT

01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:01.882
THIS BILL IS UNREASONABLE, IT'S

01:42:01.949 --> 01:42:06.854
BECAUSE OF THE COST AND IT SAYS

01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:10.023
AGE VERIFICATION. SO, RIGHT. THE

01:42:10.090 --> 01:42:12.359
BILL REQUIRES DISCLOSURES TO

01:42:12.426 --> 01:42:15.128
MINOR USERS AND WOULD REQUIRE

01:42:15.195 --> 01:42:17.397
PLATFORMS TO KNOW WITH CERTAINTY

01:42:17.464 --> 01:42:21.401
WHICH USERS ARE MINORS. AGE

01:42:21.468 --> 01:42:23.537
VERIFICATION IS A PRIVACY

01:42:23.604 --> 01:42:26.306
INTRUSIVE AND COSTLY REQUIREMENT

01:42:26.373 --> 01:42:28.942
TO IMPOSE BROADLY ON AI

01:42:29.009 --> 01:42:32.479
DEVELOPERS. SO COLLECTING OF

01:42:32.546 --> 01:42:34.648
IDS, STORING THAT INFORMATION IS

01:42:34.715 --> 01:42:37.117
ALL PART OF THE COST OF DOING

01:42:37.184 --> 01:42:38.619
BUSINESS, AND TO VERIFY THAT IS

01:42:38.685 --> 01:42:41.421
ALSO A COST AS WELL. I DON'T

01:42:41.488 --> 01:42:45.158
KNOW MUCH MORE TO DIVE INTO

01:42:45.225 --> 01:42:47.227
THAT. SO HOW MUCH ARE WE TALKING

01:42:47.294 --> 01:42:49.496
ABOUT? OH, I DON'T HAVE A NUMBER

01:42:49.563 --> 01:42:50.497
IN FRONT OF ME RIGHT NOW, BUT I

01:42:50.564 --> 01:42:52.533
CAN GET THAT TO YOU IF YOU'D

01:42:52.599 --> 01:42:54.868
LIKE. I WOULD LIKE, BECAUSE

01:42:54.935 --> 01:42:56.069
OFTENTIMES, AGAIN, OVER AND

01:42:56.136 --> 01:42:57.804
OVER, WE'VE SEEN THESE BILLS.

01:42:57.871 --> 01:42:59.640
WE'VE HEARD STORIES SIMILAR TO

01:42:59.706 --> 01:43:01.542
THE ONE THAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY.

01:43:01.608 --> 01:43:04.778
AND COST SEEMS TO BE AN ISSUE IN

01:43:04.845 --> 01:43:05.879
EVERY ONE OF THESE BILLS WHERE

01:43:05.946 --> 01:43:09.216
WE'RE TRYING TO ESTABLISH A

01:43:09.283 --> 01:43:11.852
FRAMEWORK IN WHICH, YOU KNOW, WE

01:43:11.919 --> 01:43:14.655
DON'T WANT TO STIFLE INNOVATION,

01:43:14.721 --> 01:43:17.190
WE WANT TO, YOU KNOW, HAVE

01:43:17.257 --> 01:43:18.625
ACCESS TO A LOT OF THE TOOLS

01:43:18.692 --> 01:43:19.760
THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT OUR

01:43:19.826 --> 01:43:22.896
YOUTH ARE USING. UNFORTUNATELY,

01:43:22.963 --> 01:43:25.732
WE'RE SEEING EXAMPLE AFTER

01:43:25.799 --> 01:43:28.969
EXAMPLE OF REALLY DETRIMENTAL

01:43:29.036 --> 01:43:31.138
OUTCOMES BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A

01:43:31.204 --> 01:43:33.240
LOT OF THIS FRAMEWORK IN PLACE.

01:43:33.307 --> 01:43:35.842
AND SO I REALLY WANT TO GET TO

01:43:35.909 --> 01:43:39.913
THE ISSUE OF COST AND PROFITS,

01:43:39.980 --> 01:43:41.281
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THERE'S

01:43:41.348 --> 01:43:44.151
PROFITS ATTACHED TO THE USE OF A

01:43:44.217 --> 01:43:45.652
LOT OF THESE NEW TOOLS THAT

01:43:45.719 --> 01:43:47.754
WE'RE USING. SO IF YOU'RE GOING

01:43:47.821 --> 01:43:49.056
TO CONTINUE TO COME INTO THIS

01:43:49.122 --> 01:43:52.459
COMMITTEE AND TALK ABOUT THE

01:43:52.526 --> 01:43:54.528
COST OF SAVING LIVES, THAT I

01:43:54.595 --> 01:43:56.897
WANT TO SEE THAT COST BREAKDOWN

01:43:56.964 --> 01:44:01.368
AND I WANT TO SEE THE PROFITS.

01:44:01.435 --> 01:44:02.502
THANK YOU. MR. ORTEGA. I SHOULD

01:44:02.569 --> 01:44:06.373
ALSO POINT OUT, MR. BOYKIN, THAT

01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:07.574
THERE IS NOWHERE IN THE BILL

01:44:07.641 --> 01:44:09.276
THAT TALKS ABOUT AGE

01:44:09.343 --> 01:44:11.211
VERIFICATION OR REQUIRES AGE

01:44:11.278 --> 01:44:13.046
VERIFICATION. SO IT IS STUNNING

01:44:13.113 --> 01:44:15.182
THAT IT IS A PART OF YOUR

01:44:15.248 --> 01:44:16.116
OPPOSITION LETTER TO POINT OUT

01:44:16.183 --> 01:44:17.884
THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH AGE

01:44:17.951 --> 01:44:19.753
VERIFICATION, WHEN THAT IS NOT A

01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:21.188
COMPONENT OF THIS LEGISLATION.

01:44:21.254 --> 01:44:22.422
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG,

01:44:22.489 --> 01:44:24.858
SENATOR. YOU'RE CORRECT, MR.

01:44:24.925 --> 01:44:26.927
CHAIRMAN. ANY OTHER COMMENTS

01:44:26.994 --> 01:44:30.931
FROM THE DAIS? OKAY. FIRST OF

01:44:30.998 --> 01:44:36.303
ALL, MISS GARCIA, YOUR ADVOCACY

01:44:36.370 --> 01:44:39.239
WORKS. YOU ARE BEING HERE TODAY

01:44:39.306 --> 01:44:41.708
IS MAKING A BIG IMPACT. THANK

01:44:41.775 --> 01:44:43.844
YOU. I KNOW HOW CHALLENGING IT

01:44:43.910 --> 01:44:46.780
IS TO TELL THIS STORY. IF THERE

01:44:46.847 --> 01:44:49.916
IS ANYTHING WORSE THAN A CHILD

01:44:49.983 --> 01:44:51.652
TAKING THEIR OWN LIFE, SOMEBODY

01:44:51.718 --> 01:44:57.557
NEEDS TO TELL ME WHAT THAT IS.

01:44:57.624 --> 01:45:01.461
NOW. YOUTH SUICIDE IS UP 60% IN

01:45:01.528 --> 01:45:03.997
THE LAST DECADE, UNDOUBTEDLY

01:45:04.064 --> 01:45:05.065
BECAUSE THE IMPACT OF

01:45:05.132 --> 01:45:06.500
TECHNOLOGY. AND I THANK THE

01:45:06.566 --> 01:45:09.736
SENATOR FOR THE EMPIRICAL

01:45:09.803 --> 01:45:12.139
EVIDENCE ABOUT THE IMPACTS THAT

01:45:12.205 --> 01:45:14.508
AI CHATBOTS ARE HAVING REAL TIME

01:45:14.574 --> 01:45:16.576
ON OUR YOUTH, BECAUSE IT'S

01:45:16.643 --> 01:45:17.678
EFFECTIVELY SAYING THE KID IS

01:45:17.744 --> 01:45:20.080
HAVING A LUNG PROBLEMS AND

01:45:20.147 --> 01:45:21.481
BREATHING PROBLEMS, AND GOES TO

01:45:21.548 --> 01:45:25.218
THE HOSPITAL AND GETS HANDED A

01:45:25.285 --> 01:45:26.486
PACK OF CIGARETTES ON THE WAY IN,

01:45:26.553 --> 01:45:28.255
BECAUSE YOU'RE TAKING SOMEBODY

01:45:28.321 --> 01:45:29.823
WHO'S ALREADY SUFFERING FROM

01:45:29.890 --> 01:45:31.425
DEPRESSION AND PUTTING THEM IN

01:45:31.491 --> 01:45:33.493
AN EVEN WORSE SITUATION. THE

01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:35.796
NUMBER ONE JOB OF GOVERNMENT IS

01:45:35.862 --> 01:45:37.431
TO PROTECT ITS CITIZENS, THE

01:45:37.497 --> 01:45:38.565
NUMBER ONE JOB. AND WE'RE

01:45:38.632 --> 01:45:41.902
FAILING BY NOT PUTTING SAFETY

01:45:41.968 --> 01:45:45.105
STANDARDS IN AS THE NUMBER ONE

01:45:45.172 --> 01:45:46.807
ISSUE WHEN ALLOWING THESE TYPES

01:45:46.873 --> 01:45:48.308
OF PRODUCTS TO HIT THE

01:45:48.375 --> 01:45:49.743
MARKETPLACE. AND THINK ABOUT IT

01:45:49.810 --> 01:45:51.578
THIS WAY, THINK ABOUT WHAT

01:45:51.645 --> 01:45:52.979
HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE ON THE

01:45:53.046 --> 01:45:54.715
ROADS. THINK ABOUT HOW OUR

01:45:54.781 --> 01:45:56.183
DEPARTMENTS OF TRANSPORTATION

01:45:56.249 --> 01:45:58.685
SETS SPEED LIMITS. DO THEY START

01:45:58.752 --> 01:46:00.087
AT A SPEED LIMITS THAT'S TOO

01:46:00.153 --> 01:46:02.756
HIGH AND THEN LOWER THEM, OR DO

01:46:02.823 --> 01:46:04.825
THEY START THE OTHER WAY AROUND?

01:46:04.891 --> 01:46:06.693
WE START AT A LOWER SPEED LIMIT.

01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:08.862
WE DO TRAFFIC STUDIES AND SAFETY

01:46:08.929 --> 01:46:11.331
STUDIES TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER OR

01:46:11.398 --> 01:46:13.533
NOT IT'S POSSIBLE TO EVEN DO

01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:16.203
THAT. AND IN THIS CASE, WE'RE

01:46:16.269 --> 01:46:17.471
WORKING BACKWARDS THE OTHER WAY

01:46:17.537 --> 01:46:21.708
AROUND. IT'S VERY OBVIOUS THE

01:46:21.775 --> 01:46:23.276
GUARDRAILS ARE NEEDED FOR THIS

01:46:23.343 --> 01:46:24.978
RAPIDLY EVOLVING TECHNOLOGY.

01:46:25.045 --> 01:46:26.847
WHOLE GENERATIONS ARE BEING USED

01:46:26.913 --> 01:46:28.715
AS GUINEA PIGS. AS THE SENATOR

01:46:28.782 --> 01:46:30.851
POINTED OUT, IN THESE SOCIAL AND

01:46:30.917 --> 01:46:31.618
TECHNOLOGICAL EXPERIMENTS. AND

01:46:31.685 --> 01:46:33.420
WE JUST CANNOT FALL BEHIND ON

01:46:33.487 --> 01:46:35.388
THIS KIND OF STUFF. WE HAVE TO

01:46:35.455 --> 01:46:37.591
BE AHEAD OF THE CURVE, AHEAD OF

01:46:37.657 --> 01:46:39.392
THE CURVE, OR ELSE IT WILL BE AT

01:46:39.459 --> 01:46:41.461
THE EXPENSE OF THE MENTAL AND

01:46:41.528 --> 01:46:42.996
PHYSICAL HEALTH OF OUR YOUNG

01:46:43.063 --> 01:46:45.565
PEOPLE. AND SO FOR ME, IT'S NOT

01:46:45.632 --> 01:46:47.567
ONEROUS FOR US TO BEGIN AT A

01:46:47.634 --> 01:46:49.569
LEVEL OF HIGH SAFETY STANDARDS

01:46:49.636 --> 01:46:51.505
TO MAKE SURE THERE IS NOT ONE

01:46:51.571 --> 01:46:53.206
CHILD THAT'S TAKING THEIR LIFE

01:46:53.273 --> 01:46:55.075
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND

01:46:55.142 --> 01:46:56.576
DARE I SAY, THE REST OF THE

01:46:56.643 --> 01:46:58.111
COUNTRY IS WATCHING WHAT WE DO

01:46:58.178 --> 01:46:59.780
HERE. SO THE IMPLICATIONS HERE

01:46:59.846 --> 01:47:02.082
EXTEND BEYOND CALIFORNIA TO

01:47:02.149 --> 01:47:03.817
PLACES LIKE FLORIDA AND

01:47:03.884 --> 01:47:05.886
OTHERWISE. AND ON THAT NOTE,

01:47:05.952 --> 01:47:07.154
SENATOR, WOULD YOU LIKE TO

01:47:07.220 --> 01:47:09.055
CLOSE? THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN

01:47:09.122 --> 01:47:10.690
AND MEMBERS, FOR YOUR ATTENTION

01:47:10.757 --> 01:47:12.359
TO THIS BILL. I WOULD ALSO ADD

01:47:12.425 --> 01:47:13.360
TO THE RECORD, THIS BILL IS

01:47:13.426 --> 01:47:15.796
UNIQUE IN THE NATION IN TERMS OF

01:47:15.862 --> 01:47:16.663
STATE LEGISLATION THAT ADDRESSES

01:47:16.730 --> 01:47:18.565
THIS PARTICULAR DYNAMIC. AND AS

01:47:18.632 --> 01:47:20.333
YOU POINT OUT, MR. CHAIRMAN,

01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:21.668
WE'VE SEEN THIS MOVIE BEFORE.

01:47:21.735 --> 01:47:23.970
THE IDEA THAT A UNIT OF VALUE IN

01:47:24.037 --> 01:47:25.739
SOME CONTEXT, WHETHER IT WAS IN

01:47:25.806 --> 01:47:28.575
THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY OR IN THE

01:47:28.642 --> 01:47:29.943
EARLY 21ST CENTURY, TO MONETIZE

01:47:30.010 --> 01:47:31.578
THAT TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT

01:47:31.645 --> 01:47:33.547
POSSIBLE WITH ABANDON, TO RESIST

01:47:33.613 --> 01:47:35.816
ANY REGULATORY FRAMEWORK ON THE

01:47:35.882 --> 01:47:37.317
IDEA AND THE ARGUMENT THAT WILL

01:47:37.384 --> 01:47:39.052
STIFLE INNOVATION AND FREE

01:47:39.119 --> 01:47:40.587
ENTERPRISE AND TIME AND TIME

01:47:40.654 --> 01:47:41.955
AGAIN, WHETHER IT WAS WITH

01:47:42.022 --> 01:47:43.690
ALCOHOL OR TOBACCO, OR WITH THE

01:47:43.757 --> 01:47:45.025
ADVENT OF THE INTERNET AND

01:47:45.091 --> 01:47:46.960
SOCIAL MEDIA IN MODERN TIMES,

01:47:47.027 --> 01:47:49.162
THE SAME DYNAMIC HAS PRESENTED

01:47:49.229 --> 01:47:50.697
ITSELF. AND I WOULD JUST SAY

01:47:50.764 --> 01:47:52.399
THAT HERE WE HAVE A UNIQUE

01:47:52.465 --> 01:47:54.301
OPPORTUNITY TO SEIZE A WINDOW OF

01:47:54.367 --> 01:47:56.770
OPPORTUNITY BEFORE IT IS TOO

01:47:56.837 --> 01:47:59.105
LATE TO NOT BE BEHIND THE CURVE,

01:47:59.172 --> 01:48:02.776
BUT TO BE AHEAD OF IT. IF WE CAN

01:48:02.843 --> 01:48:06.146
PUT A MAN ON THE MOON WITH 1960S

01:48:06.213 --> 01:48:08.715
TECHNOLOGY NEARLY 60 YEARS AGO,

01:48:08.782 --> 01:48:12.118
WE CAN WALK AND CHEW GUM. WE CAN

01:48:12.185 --> 01:48:13.920
ENCOURAGE APPROPRIATE INNOVATION

01:48:13.987 --> 01:48:15.088
AND THE DEPLOYMENT OF SOME

01:48:15.155 --> 01:48:16.590
AMAZING TECHNOLOGY, THE LIKES OF

01:48:16.656 --> 01:48:18.358
WHICH HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO

01:48:18.425 --> 01:48:20.327
CHANGE OUR SOCIETY IN BIGGER

01:48:20.393 --> 01:48:21.828
WAYS THAN SINCE THE INDUSTRIAL

01:48:21.895 --> 01:48:23.430
REVOLUTION, I WOULD SUBMIT. BUT

01:48:23.496 --> 01:48:25.665
WE CAN ALSO PUT REASONABLE AND

01:48:25.732 --> 01:48:27.934
SENSIBLE GUARDRAILS TO PROTECT

01:48:28.001 --> 01:48:30.837
THOSE MOST VULNERABLE FROM THE

01:48:30.904 --> 01:48:33.907
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. WE ARE

01:48:33.974 --> 01:48:35.508
GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH

01:48:35.575 --> 01:48:37.077
ALL STAKEHOLDERS ON THE NITTY

02:06:28.180 --> 02:06:29.048
PRODUCTS ARE EASILY OBTAINED

02:06:29.114 --> 02:06:31.650
WITHOUT VERIFYING AGE OR ID, THE

02:06:31.717 --> 02:06:33.886
WAY MY DISPENSARY DOES, AND

02:06:33.953 --> 02:06:35.154
EVERY OTHER LEGAL AND LICENSED

02:06:35.220 --> 02:06:36.455
CANNABIS RETAILER IN THE STATE

02:06:36.522 --> 02:06:37.790
OF CALIFORNIA ALSO DOES, WHICH

02:06:37.856 --> 02:06:39.224
MEANS THESE ILLEGAL PRODUCTS END

02:06:39.291 --> 02:06:40.893
UP IN TEENAGERS HANDS. AS A

02:06:40.960 --> 02:06:43.228
FATHER OF FOUR, I FIND THAT

02:06:43.295 --> 02:06:44.129
OBJECTIONABLE. THIS MARKET

02:06:44.196 --> 02:06:45.731
THRIVES IN A REGULATORY BLIND

02:06:45.798 --> 02:06:47.066
SPOT. THE DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS

02:06:47.132 --> 02:06:48.934
CONTROL FOCUSES ON CULTIVATORS.

02:06:49.001 --> 02:06:51.470
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS LARGELY,

02:06:51.537 --> 02:06:52.805
LARGELY TARGET ILLEGAL

02:06:52.871 --> 02:06:55.174
STOREFRONTS, BUT NO ONE TARGETS

02:06:55.240 --> 02:06:56.942
ONLINE SALES WHERE MOST OF THIS

02:06:57.009 --> 02:06:58.377
COMMERCE IS HAPPENING, AND THESE

02:06:58.444 --> 02:07:00.179
ARE LARGELY UNPOLICED PORTALS,

02:07:00.245 --> 02:07:02.681
SB 378 HELPS CLOSE THAT GAP. IT

02:07:02.748 --> 02:07:04.316
GIVES CONSUMERS AND LEGAL

02:07:04.383 --> 02:07:06.552
BUSINESSES A WAY TO HOLD

02:07:06.618 --> 02:07:07.720
PLATFORMS ACCOUNTABLE, AND STOPS

02:07:07.786 --> 02:07:09.088

A LITTLE WINDED. RAND MARTIN, ON

02:09:49.948 --> 02:09:51.683
BEHALF OF THE U.S. HEMP

02:09:51.750 --> 02:09:52.818
ROUNDTABLE, I WANT TO START OFF

02:09:52.885 --> 02:09:54.553
BY SAYING WE APPRECIATE WHERE

02:09:54.620 --> 02:09:56.321
THE SENATOR IS GOING WITH THIS.

02:09:56.388 --> 02:09:58.590
WE AGREE THAT THERE ARE BAD

02:09:58.657 --> 02:09:59.591
ACTORS IN BOTH THE CANNABIS AND

02:09:59.658 --> 02:10:00.859
THE HEMP FIELD, AND WE DO NOT

02:10:00.926 --> 02:10:02.794
WANT CONSUMERS HAVING TO GET

02:10:02.861 --> 02:10:04.696
ACCESS TO THOSE, AND WE DON'T

02:10:04.763 --> 02:10:05.731
WANT THEM HARMING THE PEOPLE WHO

02:10:05.797 --> 02:10:07.833
ARE COMPLIANT ACTORS IN BOTH THE

02:10:07.900 --> 02:10:09.234
CANNABIS AND THE HEMP FIELD. THE

02:10:09.301 --> 02:10:11.470
PROBLEM IS THAT THERE ARE

02:10:11.537 --> 02:10:14.273
NUANCES RELATIVE TO HOW HEMP IS

02:10:14.339 --> 02:10:16.875
DEFINED. SO YES, THERE ARE

02:10:16.942 --> 02:10:17.943
INTOXICATING HEMP PRODUCTS OUT

02:10:18.010 --> 02:10:20.012
THERE, AND SOME OF THOSE ARE

02:10:20.078 --> 02:10:21.713
BEING SOLD ONLINE AND PROBABLY

02:10:21.780 --> 02:10:23.715
SHOULD NOT BE SOLD ONLINE. THERE

02:10:23.782 --> 02:10:25.050
ARE OTHERS THAT ARE WELLNESS

02:10:25.117 --> 02:10:26.585
PRODUCTS THAT HAVE VERY LOW

02:10:26.652 --> 02:10:29.054
LEVELS OF THC THAT ARE GETTING

02:10:29.121 --> 02:10:30.956
SWEPT IN. THESE ARE GOOD ACTORS.

02:10:31.023 --> 02:10:32.324
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:10:32.391 --> 02:10:34.960
CALIFORNIA BASED, WHO ARE DOING

02:10:35.027 --> 02:10:36.762
RIGHT BY WHAT THE LAW SAYS

02:10:36.828 --> 02:10:38.697
RELATIVE TO A HEMP MANUFACTURER,

02:10:38.764 --> 02:10:40.032
BUT WHO ARE BEING SWEPT INTO

02:10:40.098 --> 02:10:42.034
THIS BILL, ARE BEING SWEPT IN IN

02:10:42.100 --> 02:10:44.536
OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT THE

02:10:44.603 --> 02:10:45.771
GOVERNOR AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN

02:10:45.837 --> 02:10:47.105
INVOLVED WITH RELATIVE TO

02:10:47.172 --> 02:10:49.308
DEFINING HIM, WE NEED A

02:10:49.374 --> 02:10:51.810
DEFINITION OF HEMP THAT

02:10:51.877 --> 02:10:53.679
RECOGNIZES THESE NUANCES. THIS

02:10:53.745 --> 02:10:55.714
BILL, UNFORTUNATELY, DOES NOT DO

02:10:55.781 --> 02:10:57.216
THAT. WE HAVE ASKED THE SENATOR

02:10:57.282 --> 02:10:59.551
AND HIS SPONSORS TO CONSIDER

02:10:59.618 --> 02:11:00.819
LEADING THE CHARGE IN TERMS OF

02:11:00.886 --> 02:11:02.621
COMING UP WITH THAT NUANCED

02:11:02.688 --> 02:11:03.922
DEFINITION. THAT HAS NOT

02:11:03.989 --> 02:11:06.158
HAPPENED YET. WE REALLY WOULD

02:11:06.225 --> 02:11:08.360
CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE HIM AND

02:11:08.427 --> 02:11:10.896
UFC W TO TAKE AMENDMENTS THAT

02:11:10.963 --> 02:11:12.431
WOULD WOULD NOT SWEEP IN THESE

02:11:12.497 --> 02:11:14.499
GOOD ACTORS THE WAY THEY HAVE.

02:11:14.566 --> 02:11:16.401
BUSINESSES ARE BEING IMPACTED.

02:11:16.468 --> 02:11:18.070
THE STATE BUDGET IS BEING

02:11:18.136 --> 02:11:19.938
IMPACTED. $100 MILLION HAS BEEN

02:11:20.005 --> 02:11:22.074
LOST SINCE SEPTEMBER 9TH OF LAST

02:11:22.140 --> 02:11:23.842
YEAR, WHEN EMERGENCY REGULATIONS

02:11:23.909 --> 02:11:26.011
WENT INTO EFFECT AND WIPED OUT A

02:11:26.078 --> 02:11:28.146
WHOLE BUNCH OF GOOD ACTORS.

02:11:28.213 --> 02:11:30.415
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY. WE CAN'T

02:11:30.482 --> 02:11:32.251
AFFORD TO LOSE THIS TIME OF YEAR

02:11:32.317 --> 02:11:33.652
FOR REASONS THAT ARE NOT

02:11:33.719 --> 02:11:34.753
CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE

02:11:34.820 --> 02:11:36.521
ORIGINAL INTENT OF

02:11:36.588 --> 02:11:38.056
ASSEMBLYMEMBER AGUILAR BILL WAS

02:11:38.123 --> 02:11:41.560
IN 20 AND 21 2021. IT'S ALSO

02:11:41.627 --> 02:11:43.295
IMPACTING CONSUMERS WHO WOULD

02:11:43.362 --> 02:11:45.530
LIKE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THESE

02:11:45.597 --> 02:11:46.898
PRODUCTS THAT ARE WELLNESS

02:11:46.965 --> 02:11:48.333
PRODUCTS. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:50.435
THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THEM.

02:11:50.502 --> 02:11:51.303
UNFORTUNATELY, CURRENT LAW AND

02:11:51.370 --> 02:11:54.273
SB 378 CONTINUES TO KEEP THEM

02:11:54.339 --> 02:11:55.941
FROM BEING ABLE TO ACCESS THEM.

02:11:56.008 --> 02:11:57.609
AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS AND

02:11:57.676 --> 02:11:59.311
HOPING THAT WE CAN COME UP WITH

02:11:59.378 --> 02:12:01.346
A SOLUTION THAT SATISFIES THE

02:12:01.413 --> 02:12:03.348
GOOD ACTORS IN HEMP AND GETS RID

02:12:03.415 --> 02:12:04.883
OF THE BAD ACTORS BOTH IN

02:12:04.950 --> 02:12:07.352
CANNABIS AND HEMP, WE MUST

02:12:07.419 --> 02:12:08.587
REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL AT

02:12:08.654 --> 02:12:10.355
THIS POINT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU

02:12:10.422 --> 02:12:13.892

02:12:13.959 --> 02:12:15.260
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT WISH

02:12:15.327 --> 02:12:17.863

02:12:17.929 --> 02:12:19.865

MAKING SURE THERE'S A PATH TO

02:12:40.385 --> 02:12:43.021
COMPLIANCE HERE AND SOME OF THE

02:12:43.088 --> 02:12:43.622
NUANCES BETWEEN PEER TO PEER

02:12:43.689 --> 02:12:44.222
MARKETPLACES IS JUST A, YOU

02:12:44.289 --> 02:12:46.425

02:12:46.491 --> 02:12:48.160
HOW WE CAN COMPLY. SO LOOK

MUCH TO MY CHAGRIN, I'M IN AN

02:12:57.536 --> 02:12:59.971
AWKWARD POSITION, AND I'VE BEEN

02:13:00.038 --> 02:13:07.312
CALLED THE GOP WEED GUY. CAN WE

02:13:07.379 --> 02:13:10.782
JUST WEED? WEED, WEED, WEED,

02:13:10.849 --> 02:13:14.386
WEED? NO, THE GOP WEED GUY. IT'S

02:13:14.453 --> 02:13:15.520
UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE I WILL NEVER

02:13:15.587 --> 02:13:17.522
BE WORKING A BOWL MYSELF. EVER,

02:13:17.589 --> 02:13:22.961
EVER, EVER. BUT LET'S JUST GET

02:13:23.028 --> 02:13:24.463
THAT OUT OUT THERE. BUT LET ME

02:13:24.529 --> 02:13:26.932
JUST SAY THAT THE ONLY

02:13:26.998 --> 02:13:28.367
LEGITIMATE THREAT TO THE ILLICIT

02:13:28.433 --> 02:13:30.669
MARKET IS THE LEGAL MARKET. AND

02:13:30.736 --> 02:13:32.437
I'M VERY, VERY THANKFUL THAT WE

02:13:32.504 --> 02:13:35.307
STILL HAVE AN ENDANGERED SPECIES

02:13:35.374 --> 02:13:38.043
CALLED ILLEGAL RETAILER. THEY'RE

02:13:38.110 --> 02:13:40.712
DYING OUT EVERYBODY. AND WHY?

02:13:40.779 --> 02:13:42.781
BECAUSE WE'VE OVERREGULATED THE

02:13:42.848 --> 02:13:44.349
COMPLIANT. AND WE HAVE NOT TAKEN

02:13:44.416 --> 02:13:46.118
ON THE NONCOMPLIANT AND THE

02:13:46.184 --> 02:13:48.253
ILLICIT MARKET IN A VERY FAIR

02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:51.456
MANNER. AND I'M SORRY FOR MR.

02:13:51.523 --> 02:13:52.891
HEMP, DUDE. I'M SORRY I DON'T

02:13:52.958 --> 02:13:56.061
REMEMBER YOUR NAME. I THINK THAT

02:13:56.128 --> 02:13:57.629
THAT IS A LEGITIMATE CONCERN.

02:13:57.696 --> 02:13:59.264
BUT IT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL

02:13:59.331 --> 02:14:01.233
ADDRESSES, AND IT DOESN'T TAKE

02:14:01.299 --> 02:14:04.136
AWAY FROM THE CREDIBILITY THAT

02:14:04.202 --> 02:14:06.938
THIS NEEDS TO HAPPEN RIGHT NOW.

02:14:07.005 --> 02:14:09.174
AND WE ALL KNOW WHO THESE

02:14:09.241 --> 02:14:09.741
DELIVERY PEOPLE ARE. THEY'RE

02:14:09.808 --> 02:14:12.978
DOING THEIR JOB AND THEY DON'T

02:14:13.044 --> 02:14:14.780
DISCRIMINATE RIGHT NOW. SO THIS

02:14:14.846 --> 02:14:17.082
NEEDS TO HAPPEN. WE NEED TO MAKE

02:14:17.149 --> 02:14:18.817
A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THOSE WHO

02:14:18.884 --> 02:14:21.953
ARE PAYING A RIDICULOUS PRICE, A

02:14:22.020 --> 02:14:24.289
RIDICULOUS PRICE FOR COMPLIANCE.

02:14:24.356 --> 02:14:27.859
I CARRIED BILLS MYSELF TO TRY TO

02:14:27.926 --> 02:14:30.328
REDUCE THE APPETITE TO OVERTAX

02:14:30.395 --> 02:14:31.997
THIS INDUSTRY. THAT'S JUST

02:14:32.063 --> 02:14:35.634
TRYING TO RUB OUT THE HURTFUL,

02:14:35.700 --> 02:14:37.502
THE HURTFUL PLAYERS IN THIS

02:14:37.569 --> 02:14:39.604
SPACE. AND THEY ARE WICKED

02:14:39.671 --> 02:14:42.073
PEOPLE, I WILL TELL YOU THAT.

02:14:42.140 --> 02:14:44.342
AND THEY ARE DOMINATING THIS

02:14:44.409 --> 02:14:46.178
MARKET, DOMINATING. IT'S NOT

02:14:46.244 --> 02:14:48.680
EVEN CLOSE. AS I SAID, YOU'RE AN

02:14:48.747 --> 02:14:50.482
ENDANGERED SPECIES FOR A REASON,

02:14:50.549 --> 02:14:51.983
AND IT'S BECAUSE THIS DARN STATE

02:14:52.050 --> 02:14:54.152
DID NOT TAKE ENFORCEMENT

02:14:54.219 --> 02:14:54.653
SERIOUSLY. AND I'VE BEEN

02:14:54.719 --> 02:14:57.289
FIGHTING FOR THIS SINCE 20,

02:14:57.355 --> 02:14:59.024
WHENEVER THAT WAS THAT, WE MADE

02:14:59.090 --> 02:15:01.259
IT LEGAL. 18 I FORGET WHAT YEAR

02:15:01.326 --> 02:15:04.463
IT IS. IT WAS A BAD YEAR FOR ME.

02:15:04.529 --> 02:15:06.731
BUT I WILL TELL YOU FOLKS, THIS

02:15:06.798 --> 02:15:08.600
IS A VERY LEGITIMATE BILL AND

02:15:08.667 --> 02:15:09.968
I'M VERY THANKFUL BECAUSE IT

02:15:10.035 --> 02:15:11.269
NEEDS TO. IT SHOULD HAVE

02:15:11.336 --> 02:15:13.138
HAPPENED LONG AGO, SO I'M

02:15:13.205 --> 02:15:15.674
THANKFUL TO SUPPORT IT. AND

02:15:15.740 --> 02:15:18.477
YEAH, I HOPE THE REST OF THE

02:15:18.543 --> 02:15:20.345
PANEL WILL UNDERSTAND THE

02:15:20.412 --> 02:15:21.546
NECESSITY THAT THIS BILL

02:15:21.613 --> 02:15:24.316
ADDRESSES. THANK YOU, MR.

02:15:24.382 --> 02:15:27.452
LACKEY. MR. WARD, THANK YOU. I

02:15:27.519 --> 02:15:29.488
WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR

02:15:29.554 --> 02:15:31.022
BRINGING THIS FORWARD AS WELL. I

02:15:31.089 --> 02:15:32.791
THINK FOR ALL THE REASONS THAT I

02:15:32.858 --> 02:15:34.259
WOULD AGREE WITH OUR COLLEAGUE,

02:15:34.326 --> 02:15:36.328
MR. LACKEY, THE ONE THING I

02:15:36.394 --> 02:15:38.163
WOULD ASK THE AUTHOR CONTINUE TO

02:15:38.230 --> 02:15:39.598
WORK ON, THOUGH, IS, YOU KNOW,

02:15:39.664 --> 02:15:42.100
I'M AWARE THAT SOME OF THIS

02:15:42.167 --> 02:15:43.802
ISSUE AROUND NON-INTOXICATING OR

02:15:43.869 --> 02:15:46.905
NOT PRODUCTS IS ADDRESSED OR

02:15:46.972 --> 02:15:47.973
ATTEMPTED TO BE ADDRESSED

02:15:48.039 --> 02:15:49.841
THROUGH AB EIGHT. THAT'S

02:15:49.908 --> 02:15:52.444
CORRECT. YES. THAT'S TRUE. AND

02:15:52.511 --> 02:15:54.579
SO, YOU KNOW, SHOULD THAT NOT BE

02:15:54.646 --> 02:15:56.381
SUCCESSFUL OR FULLY BE ABLE TO

02:15:56.448 --> 02:15:57.582
IMPLEMENT THAT, THAT'S SOMETHING

02:15:57.649 --> 02:15:59.351
THAT YOU MAY WANT TO LOOK AT AS

02:15:59.417 --> 02:16:01.453
WELL. I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THE HEMP

02:16:01.520 --> 02:16:02.821
INDUSTRY AS WELL FOR AS A

02:16:02.888 --> 02:16:04.289
COMMODITY IN ITSELF, AS A FIBER

02:16:04.356 --> 02:16:06.358
AS, AS AS A, AS AN OPPORTUNITY

02:16:06.424 --> 02:16:08.293
AS WELL FOR CBD PRODUCTS, WHICH

02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:10.495
ARE NON-INTOXICATING THAT THAT'S

02:16:10.562 --> 02:16:13.031
NOT SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE

02:16:13.098 --> 02:16:14.366
ENTRAPPED, I GUESS, THROUGH THE

02:16:14.432 --> 02:16:16.234
IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS BILL AND

02:16:16.301 --> 02:16:18.336
YOUR BILL, CAN YOU REMIND ME THE

02:16:18.403 --> 02:16:20.171
ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM AS WELL?

02:16:20.238 --> 02:16:21.907
IT'S IT CREATES PRIVATE

02:16:21.973 --> 02:16:25.577
ENFORCEMENT AND YOU KNOW, I WILL

02:16:25.644 --> 02:16:28.013
SAY WITH AB, SOME OF THE

02:16:28.079 --> 02:16:30.282
OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL IS ABOUT

02:16:30.348 --> 02:16:33.218
DEFINITIONS, AS YOU NOTED, AB

02:16:33.285 --> 02:16:34.352
EIGHT THAT'S THAT'S THE PURPOSE

02:16:34.419 --> 02:16:36.454
OR A PURPOSE OF AB EIGHT AS WELL

02:16:36.521 --> 02:16:38.857
AS THE GOVERNOR'S EMERGENCY

02:16:38.924 --> 02:16:40.992
REGULATIONS. SO I UNDERSTAND

02:16:41.059 --> 02:16:43.695
THEIR DESIRE TO HAVE THE CORRECT

02:16:43.762 --> 02:16:45.463
OR GOOD DEFINITIONS. BUT THAT'S

02:16:45.530 --> 02:16:47.966
NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT.

02:16:48.033 --> 02:16:49.968
OKAY. THANK YOU FOR THAT. OKAY.

02:16:50.035 --> 02:16:51.736
BEFORE WE GO ON, I'M GOING TO

02:16:51.803 --> 02:16:52.704
RECOGNIZE YOU, MISTER. BRIAN, I

02:16:52.771 --> 02:16:54.339
JUST WANT TO REMIND THE

02:16:54.406 --> 02:16:55.807
COMMITTEE AND, JOSH, YOU'LL LIKE

02:16:55.874 --> 02:16:57.943
THIS. THERE IS A VERY NARROW

02:16:58.009 --> 02:16:59.844
JURISDICTIONAL LENS THAT'S BEING

02:16:59.911 --> 02:17:01.279
APPLIED HERE. THIS BILL IS

02:17:01.346 --> 02:17:03.281
TRIPLE REFERRED. SO IT WILL ALSO

02:17:03.348 --> 02:17:05.750
BE IN BNP AND JUDICIARY. AND THE

02:17:05.817 --> 02:17:07.352
TASK OF THIS COMMITTEE IS TO

02:17:07.419 --> 02:17:10.622
ADDRESS THE ONLINE MARKETPLACES

02:17:10.689 --> 02:17:12.958
THEMSELVES. WITH THAT MR. BRIAN,

02:17:13.024 --> 02:17:14.926
NÓ SAVED MOST OF MY COMMENTS FOR

02:17:14.993 --> 02:17:17.095
THIS. I'D JUST LIKE TO ALIGN MY

02:17:17.162 --> 02:17:19.431
COMMENTS TODAY WITH THE GOP WEED

02:17:19.497 --> 02:17:25.003
GUY. CLICHE, MISS MCKENNA. SO I

02:17:25.070 --> 02:17:26.571
JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION. THEY

02:17:26.638 --> 02:17:29.441
COULD STILL SELL HEMP AT THE

02:17:29.507 --> 02:17:30.408
HEMP STORES. THAT ONE'S

02:17:30.475 --> 02:17:32.677
REGULATED, AM I RIGHT OR IS IT

02:17:32.744 --> 02:17:35.113
NO REGULATION FOR HIM? MISS

02:17:35.180 --> 02:17:36.982
MCHENRY? IT IS REGULATED UNDER

02:17:37.048 --> 02:17:38.450
AB 45. MISS AGUIRRE OCCURS BILL

02:17:38.516 --> 02:17:39.818
FROM A FEW YEARS AGO. THE

02:17:39.884 --> 02:17:41.753
PROBLEM IS THAT THE EMERGENCY

02:17:41.820 --> 02:17:42.587
REGULATIONS THAT WERE ADOPTED

02:17:42.654 --> 02:17:44.556
LAST SEPTEMBER BY THE GOVERNOR,

02:17:44.623 --> 02:17:45.557
BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC

02:17:45.624 --> 02:17:47.692
HEALTH SAYS THAT NO HEMP CBD

02:17:47.759 --> 02:17:50.795
PRODUCT CAN HAVE ANY THC IN IT,

02:17:50.862 --> 02:17:52.030
AND THAT HAS WIPED OUT ALMOST

02:17:52.097 --> 02:17:55.300
THE ENTIRE HEMP CBD MARKETPLACE.

02:17:55.367 --> 02:17:57.202
THAT'S THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT

02:17:57.268 --> 02:17:58.536
WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS IN 378

02:17:58.603 --> 02:18:00.505
AS WELL AS IN AB EIGHT, AND

02:18:00.572 --> 02:18:02.073
NOTHING HAS HAPPENED YET WITH AB

02:18:02.140 --> 02:18:03.508
EIGHT. SO WE KEEP OUR FINGERS

02:18:03.575 --> 02:18:05.310
CROSSED. AND THERE IS A

02:18:05.377 --> 02:18:06.778
CURRENTLY A DISCUSSION HAPPENING

02:18:06.845 --> 02:18:09.648
ABOUT WHAT THE CORRECT LEVEL

02:18:09.714 --> 02:18:11.349
SHOULD BE. AND THAT IS AN

02:18:11.416 --> 02:18:12.884
IMPORTANT CONVERSATION. AND I

02:18:12.951 --> 02:18:14.486
SUPPORT THAT CONVERSATION

02:18:14.552 --> 02:18:16.287
HAPPENING AND GETTING RESOLVED.

02:18:16.354 --> 02:18:19.290
BUT IT'S JUST NOT. THIS BILL

02:18:19.357 --> 02:18:22.560
ESSENTIALLY PROVIDES REMEDIES

02:18:22.627 --> 02:18:25.730
FOR WHATEVER THE LEGALITY OR

02:18:25.797 --> 02:18:30.835
ILLEGALITY IS. OKAY, SEEING NO

02:18:30.902 --> 02:18:33.204
OTHER COMMENTS, I JUST WANT TO

02:18:33.271 --> 02:18:35.140
THANK YOU. SENATOR WIENER. AS I

02:18:35.206 --> 02:18:36.174
NOTED BEFORE, THIS BILL IS

02:18:36.241 --> 02:18:37.108
TRIPLE REFERRED. THIS

02:18:37.175 --> 02:18:38.343
COMMITTEE'S JURISDICTION IS

02:18:38.410 --> 02:18:40.545
SOMEWHAT NARROW. I COMMEND YOU

02:18:40.612 --> 02:18:43.114
FOR YOUR WORK ON TRYING TO MAKE

02:18:43.181 --> 02:18:44.349

02:18:46.718 --> 02:18:47.318
CALIFORNIANS. THIS MEASURE

02:18:47.385 --> 02:18:48.820
ESTABLISHES MUCH NEEDED RULES OF

02:18:48.887 --> 02:18:49.954
ENGAGEMENT AROUND THE ONLINE

02:18:50.021 --> 02:18:51.589
CANNABIS MARKETPLACE. IT IS A

02:18:51.656 --> 02:18:52.824
GOOD CONSUMER PROTECTION BILL.

02:18:52.891 --> 02:18:54.926
