WE'RE PROUD TO BE PARTNERS IN

00:30:39.671 --> 00:30:41.606
CALIFORNIA. SO JUST TO GET

00:30:41.673 --> 00:30:43.708
STARTED AND TELL YOU A LITTLE

00:30:43.775 --> 00:30:45.443
BIT ABOUT CAL STATE SAN MARCOS,

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:47.645
WE WERE FOUNDED ONLY 35 YEARS

00:30:47.712 --> 00:30:49.581
AGO, AND AS I JUST MENTIONED, WE

00:30:49.647 --> 00:30:51.382
WERE FOUNDED AS A UNIVERSITY OF

00:30:51.449 --> 00:30:53.318
PLACE. YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY

00:30:53.384 --> 00:30:55.453
ABOUT BEING AN AFFORDABLE OPTION

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.689
FOR STUDENTS TO COME. AND REALLY

00:30:57.755 --> 00:30:59.857
MANY FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS,

00:30:59.924 --> 00:31:01.726
MILITARY, ONE OUT OF TEN OF OUR

00:31:01.793 --> 00:31:03.494
STUDENTS ARE MILITARY. TO REALLY

00:31:03.561 --> 00:31:05.530
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SOCIAL

00:31:05.597 --> 00:31:09.500
MOBILITY. AND WE BEING 35 YEARS

00:31:09.567 --> 00:31:11.436
YOUNG, WE'RE REALLY PROUD TO BE

00:31:11.502 --> 00:31:13.571
ONE OF THE TOP THREE FASTEST

00:31:13.638 --> 00:31:15.473
GROWING CAMPUSES IN THE CSU. I

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.342
ACTUALLY BELIEVE WE'RE THE

00:31:17.408 --> 00:31:17.976
FASTEST GROWING, BUT I HAVEN'T

00:31:18.042 --> 00:31:19.577
GOTTEN THE DATA BACK ON THAT

00:31:19.644 --> 00:31:21.613
YET, SO WE SHALL SEE. BUT EITHER

00:31:21.679 --> 00:31:25.316
WAY, WE ARE THRILLED TO BE

00:31:25.383 --> 00:31:27.452
SERVING SO MANY WONDERFUL

00:31:27.518 --> 00:31:29.554
STUDENTS, ALMOST 17,000, AND WE

00:31:29.621 --> 00:31:31.689
ARE RANKED IN THE TOP 1% IN THE

00:31:31.756 --> 00:31:33.625
COUNTRY IN ADVANCING SOCIAL

00:31:33.691 --> 00:31:37.428
MOBILITY. AND THAT'S A REALLY

00:31:37.495 --> 00:31:39.430
IMPORTANT POINT FOR US, NOT JUST

00:31:39.497 --> 00:31:40.098
ABOUT A RANKING, BUT ABOUT WHAT

00:31:40.164 --> 00:31:43.434
IT MEANS TO BE PART OF THE CSU.

00:31:43.501 --> 00:31:45.436
WHAT AN IMPORTANT PLACE HIGHER

00:31:45.503 --> 00:31:47.572
EDUCATION HAS FOR HUMAN BEINGS

00:31:47.639 --> 00:31:49.607
FOR, FOR AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR

00:31:49.674 --> 00:31:51.643
OUR REGIONAL ECONOMY AND

00:31:51.709 --> 00:31:53.811
VITALITY. AND SO WHEN I THINK

00:31:53.878 --> 00:31:55.713
ABOUT THAT, I THINK ABOUT THE

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:57.615
FACT THAT, YOU KNOW, OVER HALF

00:31:57.682 --> 00:31:59.717
OUR STUDENTS ARE FIRST IN THEIR

00:31:59.784 --> 00:32:01.586
FAMILY. SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

00:32:01.653 --> 00:32:02.253
THAT WHEN YOU'RE PART OF WHETHER

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:03.821
IT'S CAL STATE, SAN MARCOS OR

00:32:03.888 --> 00:32:05.757
THE CSU OR HIGHER EDUCATION,

00:32:05.823 --> 00:32:07.925
IT'S AFFORDABLE. WE HEAR A LOT

00:32:07.992 --> 00:32:09.594
ABOUT AFFORDABILITY. AND, YOU

00:32:09.661 --> 00:32:11.629
KNOW, 65% OF OUR STUDENTS

00:32:11.696 --> 00:32:13.598
GRADUATE WITH NO DEBT. YOU KNOW,

00:32:13.665 --> 00:32:15.600
I THINK ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF OUR

00:32:15.667 --> 00:32:17.669
STUDENTS RIGHT ON THIS CAMPUS,

00:32:17.735 --> 00:32:18.303
REALLY THROUGH THROUGH FINANCIAL

00:32:18.369 --> 00:32:19.837
AID AND ALL OF THAT. THEY DON'T

00:32:19.904 --> 00:32:21.806
THEY DON'T, YOU KNOW, THE

00:32:21.873 --> 00:32:23.841
TUITION IS COVERED. BUT FOR

00:32:23.908 --> 00:32:25.443
THOSE THAT DO HAVE DEBT, IT'S

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:27.645
AROUND. IT'S LESS THAN $15,000.

00:32:27.712 --> 00:32:29.547
SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT FIRST

00:32:29.614 --> 00:32:31.616
GENERATION, MANY BEING FROM

00:32:31.683 --> 00:32:33.451
LOWER INCOME BRACKETS, THIS IS

00:32:33.518 --> 00:32:35.653
REALLY SIGNIFICANT. WE GO BACK

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.689
TO THE MOMENT RIGHT NOW AS WE'RE

00:32:37.755 --> 00:32:38.356
THINKING ABOUT ECONOMIC VITALITY

00:32:38.423 --> 00:32:41.459
IN MANY ASK, YOU KNOW, IS

00:32:41.526 --> 00:32:43.561
COLLEGE WORTH IT. IS. AND

00:32:43.628 --> 00:32:45.697
ACCORDING TO GEORGETOWN

00:32:45.763 --> 00:32:46.297
UNIVERSITY CENTER ON EDUCATION

00:32:46.364 --> 00:32:47.932
AND WORKFORCE IN GENERAL, A

00:32:47.999 --> 00:32:49.734
BACHELOR'S DEGREE ADDS AN

00:32:49.801 --> 00:32:51.803
AVERAGE OF 2.8 MILLION IN A

00:32:51.869 --> 00:32:53.705
LIFETIME EARNING COMPARED TO

00:32:53.771 --> 00:32:55.640
THOSE THAT DO NOT HAVE A

00:32:55.707 --> 00:32:57.608
BACHELOR'S DEGREE OR HAVE HAVE A

00:32:57.675 --> 00:32:59.711
HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA. AND WHEN WE

00:32:59.777 --> 00:33:01.612
THINK ABOUT FUTURE JOBS FROM

00:33:01.679 --> 00:33:03.715
THAT STUDY, THOSE THAT OFFER

00:33:03.781 --> 00:33:05.450
STRONG WAGES, BENEFITS AND LONG

00:33:05.516 --> 00:33:07.752
TERM OPPORTUNITY, 80% OF THOSE

00:33:07.819 --> 00:33:09.687
WILL REQUIRE A DEGREE OR

00:33:09.754 --> 00:33:11.789
CREDENTIAL. BUT RIGHT NOW, I'M

00:33:11.856 --> 00:33:13.858
SITTING BY A PARTNER FROM THE

00:33:13.925 --> 00:33:17.462
SAN DIEGO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

00:33:17.528 --> 00:33:18.062
CORPORATION, AND I'M GOING TO

00:33:18.129 --> 00:33:19.697
HOPE NOT TO STEAL ANY THUNDER,

00:33:19.764 --> 00:33:21.532
BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT MENTION HOW

00:33:21.599 --> 00:33:25.570
WE PARTNER. AND, YOU KNOW, THEIR

00:33:25.636 --> 00:33:26.137
STUDY ON INCLUSIVE ECONOMIC

00:33:26.204 --> 00:33:27.905
GROWTH HAS PROJECTED THAT OUR

00:33:27.972 --> 00:33:29.674
REGION MUST DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF

00:33:29.741 --> 00:33:31.476
POST-SECONDARY EDUCATION

00:33:31.542 --> 00:33:33.611
COMPLETIONS BY 2030, ADDING

00:33:33.678 --> 00:33:35.713
20,000 WORKERS ANNUALLY WITH A

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:37.782
DEGREE OR CERTIFICATE TO SUSTAIN

00:33:37.849 --> 00:33:39.784
THE LOCAL ECONOMY. ONE OF THE

00:33:39.851 --> 00:33:41.586
THINGS ABOUT CAL STATE SAN

00:33:41.652 --> 00:33:42.253
MARCOS THAT'S PART OF CSU IS SO

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:43.855
IMPORTANT IN THE HIGHER

00:33:43.921 --> 00:33:45.990
EDUCATION ECOSYSTEM IS THAT MUST

00:33:46.057 --> 00:33:47.792
BRING IN PEOPLE THAT HAVEN'T

00:33:47.859 --> 00:33:48.326
BEEN REPRESENTED IN HIGHER

00:33:48.393 --> 00:33:51.562
EDUCATION BEFORE. AND THAT, I

00:33:51.629 --> 00:33:53.698
THINK, IS REALLY TELLING THAT WE

00:33:53.765 --> 00:33:55.733
MUST WHEN WE THINK ABOUT SOCIAL

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.568
MOBILITY, WE MUST OPEN HIGHER

00:33:57.635 --> 00:33:59.704
EDUCATION TO MAKE SURE THAT IT

00:33:59.771 --> 00:34:03.574
IS FOR ALL OF THE PEOPLE AND

00:34:03.641 --> 00:34:04.242
THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO IT,

00:34:04.308 --> 00:34:06.010
THEY CAN AFFORD IT AND THAT THEY

00:34:06.077 --> 00:34:07.879
CAN GRADUATE. AND THAT IS VERY

00:34:07.945 --> 00:34:09.647
IMPORTANT TO US HERE AT CAL

00:34:09.714 --> 00:34:11.816
STATE SAN MARCOS. WE KNOW THAT

00:34:11.883 --> 00:34:13.785
THE BENEFITS ARE FAR BEYOND JUST

00:34:13.851 --> 00:34:15.720
WAGES, THAT THERE IS A QUALITY

00:34:15.787 --> 00:34:16.387
OF LIFE, OF FINANCIAL WELL-BEING

00:34:16.454 --> 00:34:19.724
AND BETTER HEALTH, BUT EVEN MORE

00:34:19.791 --> 00:34:21.926
SO, OR IN ADDITION TO REALLY

00:34:21.993 --> 00:34:23.828
IT'S ABOUT NOT JUST THE

00:34:23.895 --> 00:34:25.863
INDIVIDUAL, BUT WHAT IT DOES FOR

00:34:25.930 --> 00:34:27.932
THE REGIONAL ECONOMY AND THAT

00:34:27.999 --> 00:34:28.433
QUALITY OF LIFE AND THE

00:34:28.499 --> 00:34:29.934
WORKFORCE THAT'S SO IMPORTANT

00:34:30.001 --> 00:34:32.003
HERE. AND EIGHT OUT OF TEN OF

00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:33.805
OUR GRADUATES TELL US THEY STAY

00:34:33.871 --> 00:34:35.740
IN THE REGION. WE ARE OF THE

00:34:35.807 --> 00:34:37.809
REGION. AND SO WE SERVE OUR

00:34:37.875 --> 00:34:41.579
REGION. WE KNOW THAT WE'RE THAT

00:34:41.646 --> 00:34:43.781
FOR US, JUST LIKE MANY CSU'S,

00:34:43.848 --> 00:34:45.583
OUR REGION IS SOUTHWEST

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:47.618
RIVERSIDE THROUGH SANDY, THROUGH

00:34:47.685 --> 00:34:49.787
SAN DIEGO COUNTY, MAKING SURE

00:34:49.854 --> 00:34:51.923
THAT THOSE FOLKS HAVE ACCESS TO

00:34:51.989 --> 00:34:53.825
HIGHER EDUCATION AND THAT THEY

00:34:53.891 --> 00:34:54.425
KNOW THEY HAVE A UNIVERSITY

00:34:54.492 --> 00:34:57.728
HERE. I DON'T JUST SPEAK FOR CAL

00:34:57.795 --> 00:34:59.697
STATE SAN MARCOS. THIS IS PART

00:34:59.764 --> 00:35:01.666
OF THE ETHOS OF CAL STATE. AND

00:35:01.732 --> 00:35:03.801
THAT'S THE REALLY THAT POWERFUL

00:35:03.868 --> 00:35:05.770
RETURN ON IMPACT. BUT ANOTHER

00:35:05.837 --> 00:35:07.905
PIECE, YOU KNOW, THAT HAS COME

00:35:07.972 --> 00:35:09.807
AS WE TALK ABOUT AFFORDABILITY

00:35:09.874 --> 00:35:13.578
AND WHAT IT WOULD COST OF LIVING

00:35:13.644 --> 00:35:15.813
AND IS HOUSING IS SO IMPORTANT

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.748
AND MAKING SURE THAT OUR

00:35:17.815 --> 00:35:19.750
STUDENTS AND WE'RE 35 YEARS

00:35:19.817 --> 00:35:21.819
YOUNG. SO I ALWAYS SAY WE RIGHT

00:35:21.886 --> 00:35:23.988
NOW ARE 17,000 STUDENTS. WE

00:35:24.055 --> 00:35:27.692
HOUSE 2200. WE REALLY ONLY HAVE

00:35:27.758 --> 00:35:29.594
1800 BEDS. SO IT'S QUITE

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:30.194
MIRACULOUS. BUT THAT HAPPENS

00:35:30.261 --> 00:35:31.796
THROUGH OUR THROUGH OUR

00:35:31.863 --> 00:35:33.865
PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR CITY AND

00:35:33.931 --> 00:35:36.000
ACTUALLY NORTH CITY RIGHT HERE

00:35:36.067 --> 00:35:37.668
IS THE DEVELOPERS RIGHT ON

00:35:37.735 --> 00:35:39.604
CAMPUS THAT HELPS FIND PLACES

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:41.706
AND SPACES FOR US. BUT I'D BE

00:35:41.772 --> 00:35:42.306
REMISS IF I DIDN'T. THANK YOU

00:35:42.373 --> 00:35:44.041
AND ALL OF YOUR COLLEAGUES FOR

00:35:44.108 --> 00:35:46.110
THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAM,

00:35:46.177 --> 00:35:49.680
BECAUSE NEXT YEAR WE FALL, WE

00:35:49.747 --> 00:35:52.016
WILL OPEN 550 NEW BEDS THANKS TO

00:35:52.083 --> 00:35:54.018
THE STATE AFFORDABLE AND TWO

00:35:54.085 --> 00:35:55.686
THIRDS AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

00:35:55.753 --> 00:35:57.788
THANKS TO THE INNOVATION OF WHAT

00:35:57.855 --> 00:35:59.724
YOU'VE DONE. LAWMAKERS, STATE OF

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:00.391
CALIFORNIA. AND I'VE NEVER BEEN

00:36:00.458 --> 00:36:02.226
IN ANY STATE THAT HAS DONE THAT.

00:36:02.293 --> 00:36:04.095
IT SHOWS THE COMMITMENT AND WHAT

00:36:04.161 --> 00:36:05.963
THAT MEANS. AND IT MEANS MORE

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:07.932
STUDENTS WHO HAVEN'T ALWAYS HAD

00:36:07.999 --> 00:36:09.700
OPPORTUNITIES CAN GO TO SCHOOL.

00:36:09.767 --> 00:36:11.736
I WANT TO GIVE YOU JUST A FEW

00:36:11.802 --> 00:36:12.236
EXAMPLES OF SOME OF THE

00:36:12.303 --> 00:36:14.038
INNOVATIVE THINGS WE'RE DOING

00:36:14.105 --> 00:36:15.740
AROUND WORKFORCE AND THE

00:36:15.806 --> 00:36:17.775
TRAJECTORY. ONE, I ALSO WANT TO

00:36:17.842 --> 00:36:18.309
SAY THANK YOU BECAUSE THE

00:36:18.376 --> 00:36:19.911
INTEGRATED SCIENCE AND

00:36:19.977 --> 00:36:20.578
ENGINEERING BUILDING, I JUST GOT

00:36:20.645 --> 00:36:22.179
AN EMAIL. THEY'RE BUILDING A

00:36:22.246 --> 00:36:23.915
FENCE. I WANT THEM TO PUT THAT

00:36:23.981 --> 00:36:25.850
SHOVEL IN THE GROUND. IT IS

00:36:25.917 --> 00:36:26.450
COMING UP AND WE'RE GOING TO

00:36:26.517 --> 00:36:28.219
HAVE THAT GROUNDBREAKING THIS

00:36:28.286 --> 00:36:29.987
MONTH. BUT THE THING THAT'S SO

00:36:30.054 --> 00:36:31.756
KEY ABOUT THAT BUILDING IS WE'RE

00:36:31.822 --> 00:36:33.691
A UNIVERSITY THAT ISN'T FULLY

00:36:33.758 --> 00:36:35.726
BUILT. AND IN PARTNERSHIP WITH

00:36:35.793 --> 00:36:36.193
VIASAT, WE STARTED AN

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:38.062
ENGINEERING PROGRAM. 30% OF OUR

00:36:38.129 --> 00:36:40.131
SOFTWARE ENGINEERS ARE VETERANS,

00:36:40.197 --> 00:36:43.734
OVER 50% HISPANIC IN THE NATION.

00:36:43.801 --> 00:36:45.770
THAT AVERAGE IS AROUND 15%. AND

00:36:45.836 --> 00:36:48.172
EVEN THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

00:36:48.239 --> 00:36:49.707
CALIFORNIA, THAT AVERAGE IS

00:36:49.774 --> 00:36:51.809
MAYBE 25%. OVER HALF OF OUR

00:36:51.876 --> 00:36:53.811
STUDENTS IN ENGINEERING RIGHT

00:36:53.878 --> 00:36:54.412
NOW ARE HISPANIC. THIS WILL

00:36:54.478 --> 00:36:57.715
ALLOW US TO GO FROM ABOUT 300

00:36:57.782 --> 00:36:58.316
ENGINEERING MAJORS TO ABOUT

00:36:58.382 --> 00:37:01.719
2000. AND FOR EVERY SOFTWARE

00:37:01.786 --> 00:37:02.219
ENGINEERING GRADUATE WE

00:37:02.286 --> 00:37:03.921
GRADUATE, THERE'S FOUR JOBS

00:37:03.988 --> 00:37:05.723
WAITING. FOR EVERY ELECTRICAL

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:06.324
ENGINEERING GRADUATE, THERE'S

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:08.159
THREE. SO THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT

00:37:08.225 --> 00:37:10.094
TO THE WORKFORCE. AND LOCAL

00:37:10.161 --> 00:37:12.029
INDUSTRY REALLY HELPED US GET

00:37:12.096 --> 00:37:13.831
THIS PROGRAM OFF THE GROUND.

00:37:13.898 --> 00:37:16.233
IT'S ALSO ABOUT PARTNERSHIPS, AS

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:17.969
I THINK ABOUT PALOMAR COLLEGE

00:37:18.035 --> 00:37:19.937
JUST DOWN THE ROAD. AND THE

00:37:20.004 --> 00:37:22.173
AMAZING LEADER THERE THAT I

00:37:22.239 --> 00:37:24.041
PARTNER WITH STAR RIVERA LACY.

00:37:24.108 --> 00:37:27.712
YOU KNOW, WE AT CSU USM, WE

00:37:27.778 --> 00:37:30.081
PRODUCE THE WE ARE THE FOURTH

00:37:30.147 --> 00:37:31.916
LARGEST PRODUCER OF NURSING IN

00:37:31.983 --> 00:37:34.018
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND A

00:37:34.085 --> 00:37:35.920
PART OF THAT IS THAT WE'RE

00:37:35.987 --> 00:37:37.788
INNOVATIVE IN THE WAY THAT WE DO

00:37:37.855 --> 00:37:39.724
IT. YOU CAN COME IN AS A

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:40.391
FRESHMAN, YOU CAN HAVE A SECOND

00:37:40.458 --> 00:37:41.926
BACHELOR'S. BUT ONE OF THE

00:37:41.993 --> 00:37:43.894
PIECES THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

00:37:43.961 --> 00:37:44.462
WITH THAT PARTNERSHIP WITH

00:37:44.528 --> 00:37:46.097
PALOMAR AND OTHER COMMUNITY

00:37:46.163 --> 00:37:49.834
COLLEGES IS WE GO FROM WE DO A

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:50.401
CONCURRENT PROGRAM WITH THE

00:37:50.468 --> 00:37:52.136
ADRIN AND THE BSN AT THE SAME

00:37:52.203 --> 00:37:54.038
TIME, SHORTER TIME TO DEGREE.

00:37:54.105 --> 00:37:56.240
IT'S HAPPENING AT THE SAME TIME

00:37:56.307 --> 00:37:57.942
IN PARTNERSHIP, INNOVATIVE

00:37:58.009 --> 00:37:59.844
PARTNERSHIP WITH PALOMAR. YOU

00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:01.746
KNOW, THAT'S NOT THE COMMUNITY.

00:38:01.812 --> 00:38:02.279
COLLEGE PARTNERSHIPS ARE

00:38:02.346 --> 00:38:04.015
IMPORTANT, BUT THE K-12 SYSTEM

00:38:04.081 --> 00:38:06.183
IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT. AND WE

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:10.187
HAVE SO MANY MOUS WITH DIFFERENT

00:38:10.254 --> 00:38:12.189
SCHOOL DISTRICTS, 28 LOCAL

00:38:12.256 --> 00:38:13.958
SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND TRIBAL

00:38:14.025 --> 00:38:16.127
PARTNERS, TO BE EXACT. AND THAT

00:38:16.193 --> 00:38:18.062
IS SO IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE

00:38:18.129 --> 00:38:18.562
THAT WE'RE STARTING WITH

00:38:18.629 --> 00:38:20.231
STUDENTS LITERALLY IN THE THIRD

00:38:20.297 --> 00:38:22.199
GRADE. AND THOSE SCHOOL BUSSES

00:38:22.266 --> 00:38:24.135
PULL UP RIGHT UNDER MY OFFICE

00:38:24.201 --> 00:38:26.103
WINDOW. SO I SEE IT THREE TIMES

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:27.938
A DAY. SCHOOL BUSSES COME

00:38:28.005 --> 00:38:29.974
THROUGH ON THE TOURS TO MAKE

00:38:30.041 --> 00:38:31.842
SURE THAT PEOPLE KNOW THAT THIS

00:38:31.909 --> 00:38:34.011
IS A PLACE FOR THEM. ONE OTHER

00:38:34.078 --> 00:38:36.047
IT'S A REALLY INNOVATIVE

00:38:36.113 --> 00:38:38.082
WORKFORCE PROGRAM AROUND THIS

00:38:38.149 --> 00:38:40.351
AND REALLY STARTING AND MOVING

00:38:40.418 --> 00:38:42.219
FORWARD WITH DUAL ENROLLMENT IS

00:38:42.286 --> 00:38:44.321
A THREE YEAR PROGRAM. IT'S

00:38:44.388 --> 00:38:46.157
CALLED SWIFT, THE SCHOLARS AND

00:38:46.223 --> 00:38:47.992
WELLNESS AND INNOVATION FAST

00:38:48.059 --> 00:38:49.860
TRACK. AND THE THING THAT'S

00:38:49.927 --> 00:38:51.862
REALLY KEY ABOUT THAT PROGRAM IS

00:38:51.929 --> 00:38:52.363
WE START WITH THE DUAL

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:55.866
ENROLLMENT. WE HAVE THREE AREA,

00:38:55.933 --> 00:38:58.135
THREE AREA HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:38:58.202 --> 00:38:59.870
RIGHT NOW THAT WE'RE PARTNERING

00:38:59.937 --> 00:39:00.504
WITH. AND WHEN THEY COME OUT OF

00:39:00.571 --> 00:39:02.273
HIGH SCHOOL THEY'VE GOT THAT

00:39:02.339 --> 00:39:03.974
COLLEGE CREDIT. AND IN THREE

00:39:04.041 --> 00:39:06.277
YEARS WITH INTERNSHIPS, WHICH

00:39:06.343 --> 00:39:07.878
ARE SO IMPORTANT THAT

00:39:07.945 --> 00:39:08.546
EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING AND ALL OF

00:39:08.612 --> 00:39:12.083
THOSE AND THREE YEARS, THEY HAVE

00:39:12.149 --> 00:39:14.085
THEIR DEGREE. BUT WHAT'S EVEN

00:39:14.151 --> 00:39:15.886
MORE IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS

00:39:15.953 --> 00:39:17.922
WELLNESS DEGREE IS IT'S IN THE

00:39:17.988 --> 00:39:18.522
MENTAL HEALTH FIELDS THAT THE

00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:20.257
COMMUNITY SAID THEY DESPERATELY

00:39:20.324 --> 00:39:22.293
NEED. THE PIECE OF THAT THAT

00:39:22.359 --> 00:39:24.295
ALSO IS KEY HERE IN INNOVATIVE

00:39:24.361 --> 00:39:25.963
IS THAT IT'S EMBEDDED WITH

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:28.032
CERTIFICATES. SO THOSE STUDENTS,

00:39:28.099 --> 00:39:28.699
INSTEAD OF GRADUATING AND BEING

00:39:28.766 --> 00:39:30.234
READY TO MAKE $30,000 A YEAR,

00:39:30.301 --> 00:39:33.838
READY TO MAKE $80,000 A YEAR.

00:39:33.904 --> 00:39:34.472
THE OTHER PIECE OF THAT IS IT

00:39:34.538 --> 00:39:36.307
TAKES SOME OF THE STRAIN OFF

00:39:36.373 --> 00:39:38.109
SOCIAL WORKERS AND PEOPLE AT THE

00:39:38.175 --> 00:39:39.844
MASTER'S LEVEL. WE JUST DON'T

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:40.478
HAVE ENOUGH MENTAL HEALTH CARE

00:39:40.544 --> 00:39:42.012
WORKERS, AND WE'VE GOT TO BE

00:39:42.079 --> 00:39:43.981
INNOVATIVE. AND THIS IS ONE OF

00:39:44.048 --> 00:39:45.850
THOSE INNOVATIVE EXAMPLES AROUND

00:39:45.916 --> 00:39:48.052
WORKFORCE AND NEED THAT IS SO

00:39:48.119 --> 00:39:49.987
IMPORTANT TO OUR ECONOMY. I THIS

00:39:50.054 --> 00:39:52.189
IS A PICTURE IS UP THERE WHERE I

00:39:52.256 --> 00:39:56.060
GOT TO GO AND WELCOME STUDENTS

00:39:56.127 --> 00:39:56.660
TO CAL STATE SAN MARCOS, ALONG

00:39:56.727 --> 00:39:58.429
WITH THEIR PRINCIPAL AND SCHOOL

00:39:58.496 --> 00:40:02.133
BOARD MEMBERS, AND AT BUENA

00:40:02.199 --> 00:40:04.034
VISTA UNIFIED, WE GAVE OUT

00:40:04.101 --> 00:40:06.103
SWEATSHIRTS ON A 95 DEGREE

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:08.239
SEPTEMBER DAY AND THEY PUT THEM

00:40:08.305 --> 00:40:10.207
ON. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. I

00:40:10.274 --> 00:40:11.876
THOUGHT THEY'D CARRY THOSE HOME,

00:40:11.942 --> 00:40:12.543
BUT THOSE SWEATSHIRTS WENT RIGHT

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:14.178
ON, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO

00:40:14.245 --> 00:40:15.980
WELCOMING THOSE STUDENTS TO CAL

00:40:16.046 --> 00:40:17.982
STATE SAN MARCOS ON THE CAMPUS

00:40:18.048 --> 00:40:20.184
WHEN THEY COME FORWARD. BUT I

00:40:20.251 --> 00:40:21.952
THINK THE REAL KEY HERE IS I

00:40:22.019 --> 00:40:23.854
TALK ABOUT THERE'S SO MANY

00:40:23.921 --> 00:40:24.488
PROGRAMS, WHETHER IT'S HOW WE

00:40:24.555 --> 00:40:26.056

00:49:32.569 --> 00:49:33.036
FOR THE STATE TO ENGAGE,

00:49:33.103 --> 00:49:33.603
ESPECIALLY AROUND PROVIDING

00:49:45.082 --> 00:49:48.485
IMPORTANT FACET OF CALIFORNIA'S

00:49:48.552 --> 00:49:50.487

ENERGY RESILIENCY FOR THE

00:49:51.088 --> 00:49:54.624
COUNTRY AS A WHOLE. JUST OUTSIDE

00:49:54.691 --> 00:49:55.225
OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY, EAST AND

00:49:55.292 --> 00:49:56.893
IMPERIAL, WE HAVE THE SALTON SEA

00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.962
AND THE LARGEST LITHIUM DEPOSIT

00:49:59.029 --> 00:50:00.864
IN THE WORLD. SO CONTINUING TO

00:50:00.931 --> 00:50:02.599
INVEST IN THAT VALUE CHAIN

00:50:02.666 --> 00:50:04.534
AROUND NOT JUST EXTRACTING

00:50:04.601 --> 00:50:05.168

MOBILITY, ENERGY STORAGE AND THE

00:50:12.542 --> 00:50:14.711

00:50:14.778 --> 00:50:16.613
WANT TO MENTION IN TERMS OF OUR

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:17.214
REGIONAL ASSETS IS ADVANCED

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:18.715
MANUFACTURING. I THINK WHEN WE

00:50:18.782 --> 00:50:20.584
THINK ABOUT MANUFACTURING, WE

00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:21.118
DON'T ALWAYS THINK ABOUT

00:50:21.184 --> 00:50:22.619
CALIFORNIA, WE DON'T ALWAYS

00:50:22.686 --> 00:50:23.253
THINK ABOUT SAN DIEGO. BUT SAN

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:24.821
DIEGO ACTUALLY HAS BEEN FOR A

00:50:24.888 --> 00:50:26.823
LONG TIME A LEADING MARKET IN

00:50:26.890 --> 00:50:28.759
TERMS OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING.

00:50:28.825 --> 00:50:30.494
BEFORE THE PANDEMIC HIT, SAN

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:32.596
DIEGO'S MANUFACTURING JOB GROWTH

00:50:32.662 --> 00:50:33.230
OUTPACED BOTH THE STATE AND THE

00:50:33.296 --> 00:50:34.931
NATION. WE'VE SEEN SOME OF THAT

00:50:34.998 --> 00:50:36.900
RETREAT IN RECENT YEARS, AS SOME

00:50:36.967 --> 00:50:38.935
OF THE FEDERAL INVESTMENTS HAVE

00:50:39.002 --> 00:50:40.937
ENCOURAGED RELOCATION OF THOSE

00:50:41.004 --> 00:50:42.773
OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE REGION

00:50:42.839 --> 00:50:44.808
AND OUTSIDE OF THE STATE. BUT

00:50:44.875 --> 00:50:46.610
NONETHELESS, WE HAVE MORE THAN

00:50:46.676 --> 00:50:48.612
240,000 MANUFACTURING JOBS IN

00:50:48.678 --> 00:50:50.480
SAN DIEGO, FROM ANYTHING FROM

00:50:50.547 --> 00:50:52.783
MEDICAL DEVICES TO SATELLITE

00:50:52.849 --> 00:50:54.718
EQUIPMENT. IT REPRESENTS 10% OF

00:50:54.785 --> 00:50:56.620
THE PRIVATE WORKFORCE HERE,

00:50:56.686 --> 00:50:57.254
PRIVATE SECTOR WORKFORCE IN SAN

00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:58.955
DIEGO, AND OBVIOUSLY A BIG ASSET

00:50:59.022 --> 00:51:02.592
AND FACET OF OUR MANUFACTURING

00:51:02.659 --> 00:51:04.628
CAPABILITIES IS THE BINATIONAL

00:51:04.694 --> 00:51:05.228
ECONOMY AND THE RELATIONSHIP

00:51:05.295 --> 00:51:06.863
WITH BAJA CALIFORNIA. SO

00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:08.832
EXPANDING MANUFACTURING

00:51:08.899 --> 00:51:09.332
INCENTIVES AND TECHNICAL

00:51:09.399 --> 00:51:10.767
ASSISTANCE FOR SMALL

00:51:10.834 --> 00:51:12.602
MANUFACTURING COMPANIES IN

00:51:12.669 --> 00:51:13.236
PARTICULAR, ESPECIALLY IN THESE

00:51:13.303 --> 00:51:15.005
HIGH VALUE SECTORS. AND ANYTHING

00:51:15.071 --> 00:51:17.007
THAT WE CAN DO TO CONTINUE TO

00:51:17.073 --> 00:51:18.875
INVEST IN AND ACCELERATE THAT

00:51:18.942 --> 00:51:20.944
BINATIONAL TRANSPORTATION AND

00:51:21.011 --> 00:51:22.913
CONNECTIVITY IN TERMS OF THE

00:51:22.979 --> 00:51:25.015
HEADWINDS THAT THE REGION IS

00:51:25.081 --> 00:51:26.850
FACING, THAT PUTS ALL OF THESE

00:51:26.917 --> 00:51:28.852
AMAZING ASSETS AT RISK. AGAIN,

00:51:28.919 --> 00:51:30.687
SOME OF THESE ARE NOT UNIQUE TO

00:51:30.754 --> 00:51:31.288
OUR REGION, BUT NONETHELESS,

00:51:31.354 --> 00:51:32.823
THEY'RE HAVING, IN SOME CASES,

00:51:32.889 --> 00:51:34.724
DISPARATE IMPACTS IN SAN DIEGO,

00:51:34.791 --> 00:51:36.593
OBVIOUSLY, FEDERAL BUDGET CUTS

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:37.160
TO SCIENCE AND RESEARCH IS

00:51:37.227 --> 00:51:40.630
IMPACTING EVERYTHING FROM THAT

00:51:40.697 --> 00:51:41.264
BASIC RESEARCH AND INNOVATION

00:51:41.331 --> 00:51:44.634
AND THE TRAJECTORY OF

00:51:44.701 --> 00:51:45.235
THERAPEUTICS AND SOLUTIONS FOR

00:51:45.302 --> 00:51:48.805
THE WORLD. BUT JUST THE JUST THE

00:51:48.872 --> 00:51:51.007
PROPOSED CUTS IN INDIRECT RATES

00:51:51.074 --> 00:51:52.976
FOR RESEARCH IN THE REGION COULD

00:51:53.043 --> 00:51:56.613
POTENTIALLY HAVE A $500 MILLION

00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:58.915
ECONOMIC IMPACT INTO OUR REGION.

00:51:58.982 --> 00:52:00.917
SO ALL OF THESE CUTS THREATEN

00:52:00.984 --> 00:52:02.953
OUR ECONOMY IN MULTIPLE WAYS. WE

00:52:03.019 --> 00:52:06.690
ARE A SMALL BUSINESS REGION. 98%

00:52:06.756 --> 00:52:08.658
OF OUR COMPANIES IN SAN DIEGO

00:52:08.725 --> 00:52:10.760
EMPLOY FEWER THAN 100 PEOPLE

00:52:10.827 --> 00:52:12.662
COLLECTIVELY. THAT'S ALMOST 60%

00:52:12.729 --> 00:52:13.230
OF THE WORKFORCE, WHICH IS

00:52:13.296 --> 00:52:14.998
DOUBLE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. SO

00:52:15.065 --> 00:52:16.900
SMALL BUSINESSES MATTER IN SAN

00:52:16.967 --> 00:52:18.768
DIEGO MORE THAN THEY THAN THEY

00:52:18.835 --> 00:52:20.670
MATTER IN OTHER PARTS OF THE OF

00:52:20.737 --> 00:52:21.338
THE COUNTRY. AND THERE'S STILL A

00:52:21.404 --> 00:52:24.875
LOT OF FRAGILITY AND INSTABILITY

00:52:24.941 --> 00:52:26.610
IN OUR SMALL BUSINESSES WHO

00:52:26.676 --> 00:52:27.244
STRUGGLE TO COMPETE FOR TALENT

00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:30.714
AND, AND, AND CONTRACTS AND

00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:31.348
OPPORTUNITIES. THERE'S A LOT OF

00:52:31.414 --> 00:52:32.883
UNCERTAINTY AROUND TRADE AND

00:52:32.949 --> 00:52:34.918
CROSS-BORDER LOGISTICS, WHICH

00:52:34.985 --> 00:52:36.653
OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD LOOK TO THE

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:38.722
STATE FOR SUPPORT THERE. GRID

00:52:38.788 --> 00:52:40.790
RESILIENCY, PERMITTING DELAYS

00:52:40.857 --> 00:52:44.694
ALSO IMPACT THE SPEED TO

00:52:44.761 --> 00:52:45.362
OPERATION, THE TIME TO DELIVERY.

00:52:45.428 --> 00:52:48.632
WE HEAR FROM COMPANIES THAT TIME

00:52:48.698 --> 00:52:49.332
TO MARKET IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN

00:52:49.399 --> 00:52:51.134
ANY FINANCIAL INCENTIVE THAT CAN

00:52:51.201 --> 00:52:53.003
BE PROVIDED. AND THEN OBVIOUSLY,

00:52:53.069 --> 00:52:54.905
SOMETHING THAT I KNOW YOU ALL

00:52:54.971 --> 00:52:56.706
WANT TO HEAR ABOUT AND CARE

00:52:56.773 --> 00:52:57.307
DEEPLY ABOUT AND CROSS ALL OF

00:52:57.374 --> 00:52:58.909
THESE THINGS IS HOUSING

00:52:58.975 --> 00:53:01.011
AFFORDABILITY AND THE WAY THAT

00:53:01.077 --> 00:53:02.612
IMPACTS BUSINESS GROWTH AND

00:53:02.679 --> 00:53:03.246
EXPANSION. EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE

00:53:03.313 --> 00:53:06.616
THESE INNOVATIVE COMPANIES AND,

00:53:06.683 --> 00:53:09.019
AND, AND STRONG INDUSTRIES THAT

00:53:09.085 --> 00:53:10.720
OFFER HIGH PAYING JOBS, THE

00:53:10.787 --> 00:53:11.254
NUMBER ONE CHALLENGE THAT

00:53:11.321 --> 00:53:14.724
EMPLOYERS CITE TO US IS TALENT

00:53:14.791 --> 00:53:15.358
ATTRACTION AND RETENTION. IT'S

00:53:15.425 --> 00:53:16.927
VERY HARD TO KEEP PEOPLE IN A

00:53:16.993 --> 00:53:19.162
REGION THAT IS CONSISTENTLY ONE

00:53:19.229 --> 00:53:21.064
OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE TO LIVE

00:53:21.131 --> 00:53:22.899
IN. WE ONE OF THE RANKINGS THAT

00:53:22.966 --> 00:53:24.801
WE'RE NOT VERY EXCITED ABOUT IS

00:53:24.868 --> 00:53:26.736
HAVING THE SECOND HIGHEST MEDIAN

00:53:26.803 --> 00:53:27.370
HOME PRICE AMONG MAJOR METROS IN

00:53:27.437 --> 00:53:30.740
THE COUNTRY. ONLY 1 IN 9

00:53:30.807 --> 00:53:32.742
HOUSEHOLDS CAN CURRENTLY AFFORD

00:53:32.809 --> 00:53:33.343
TO PURCHASE AND LIVE IN THE

00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:35.211
MEDIAN PRICED HOME, AND THAT'S A

00:53:35.278 --> 00:53:37.213
TREND THAT CONTINUES TO MOVE IN

00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:40.750
THE WRONG DIRECTION. SO IN

00:53:40.817 --> 00:53:41.318
CONCLUSION, I JUST WANT TO

00:53:41.384 --> 00:53:42.986
HIGHLIGHT AGAIN, AREAS WHERE I

00:53:43.053 --> 00:53:45.155
THINK OUR REGION WOULD WANT TO

00:53:45.221 --> 00:53:46.990
PARTNER WITH THE STATE AND HAS,

00:53:47.057 --> 00:53:47.591
YOU KNOW, FORMALLY SUBMITTED

00:53:47.657 --> 00:53:50.727
SOME OF THESE IDEAS THROUGH THE

00:53:50.794 --> 00:53:53.096
JOBS FIRST PROGRAMING AND THE

00:53:53.163 --> 00:53:54.731
ACTIVATION PLANS THAT WERE

00:53:54.798 --> 00:53:55.365
RECENTLY SUBMITTED BACK TO THE

00:53:55.432 --> 00:53:57.167
STATE, STABILIZING AND GROWING

00:53:57.233 --> 00:54:00.770
RESEARCH INVESTMENT TO CERTAINLY

00:54:00.837 --> 00:54:01.404
OFFSET SOME OF THE IMPACTS THAT

00:54:01.471 --> 00:54:03.173
WE'RE ANTICIPATING AND ALREADY

00:54:03.239 --> 00:54:05.041
FEELING FROM THE FEDERAL RETREAT

00:54:05.108 --> 00:54:06.977
SUPPORTING CROSS BORDER TRADE

00:54:07.043 --> 00:54:10.747
AND MOBILITY AND THE ADVANCED

00:54:10.814 --> 00:54:11.381
MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES AND

00:54:11.448 --> 00:54:13.049
ASSETS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE,

00:54:13.116 --> 00:54:14.884
OBVIOUSLY, DRIVING HOUSING

00:54:14.951 --> 00:54:16.786
AFFORDABILITY TO SUPPORT THE

00:54:16.853 --> 00:54:17.387
RETENTION AND ATTRACTION OF

00:54:17.454 --> 00:54:19.055
TALENT, INVESTING IN AND

00:54:19.122 --> 00:54:20.991
PARTNERING WITH LOCAL

00:54:21.057 --> 00:54:22.759
UNIVERSITIES TO STRENGTHEN THAT

00:54:22.826 --> 00:54:23.393
LOCAL TALENT PIPELINE TO MAKE

00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:24.961
SURE THAT THE PEOPLE THAT GROW

00:54:25.028 --> 00:54:26.830
UP HERE ARE THE SAME PEOPLE THAT

00:54:26.896 --> 00:54:27.497
ARE EQUIPPED TO FILL THE ROLES

00:54:27.564 --> 00:54:29.232
OF TODAY AND TOMORROW, AND THEN

00:54:29.299 --> 00:54:30.900
CONTINUING TO FUEL AND DRIVE

00:54:30.967 --> 00:54:32.936
THAT RESILIENCE AND GROWTH

00:54:33.003 --> 00:54:33.503
WITHIN OUR SMALL BUSINESSES,

00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:35.138
BECAUSE THOSE ARE CRITICAL TO

00:54:35.205 --> 00:54:37.040
THE ECONOMIC GROWTH OF OUR

00:54:37.107 --> 00:54:38.742
REGION. WITH THAT, I'LL PAUSE.

00:54:38.808 --> 00:54:39.342
AND AGAIN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH

00:54:39.409 --> 00:54:41.177
FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU, MR.

00:54:41.244 --> 00:54:42.879
VELASQUEZ, AND THANK YOU TO THE

00:54:42.946 --> 00:54:44.881
TO THE PANELISTS. I'LL LET

00:54:44.948 --> 00:54:45.415
DOCTOR PATEL ASK THE FIRST

00:54:45.482 --> 00:54:47.183
QUESTION, BUT I HAVE TO JUST

00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:49.052
SHARE SOMETHING REAL QUICK. I'M

00:54:49.119 --> 00:54:50.854
A I'M A VISUAL LEARNER BY TRADE.

00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:51.488
AND SO THE MOMENT I LANDED IN

00:54:51.554 --> 00:54:53.356
SAN DIEGO THIS MORNING TO DRIVE

00:54:53.423 --> 00:54:55.058
THROUGH DOWNTOWN, DRIVING

00:54:55.125 --> 00:54:56.760
THROUGH YOUR, YOU KNOW, TO THE

00:54:56.826 --> 00:54:58.762
CAMPUS AND EVERYTHING THAT WAS

00:54:58.828 --> 00:55:00.930
SHARED TODAY, IT'S A REMINDER OF

00:55:00.997 --> 00:55:01.464
HOW MUCH OUR ECONOMY IN

00:55:01.531 --> 00:55:03.099
CALIFORNIA HAS AN IMPACT, NOT

00:55:03.166 --> 00:55:05.068
ONLY HERE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

00:55:05.135 --> 00:55:05.702
AND SAN DIEGO, BUT THROUGHOUT

00:55:05.769 --> 00:55:07.303
OUR STATE. AND THAT'S WHY I

00:55:07.370 --> 00:55:09.105
THINK WE'RE VERY EXCITED TO KICK

00:55:09.172 --> 00:55:11.041
OFF THIS. THIS WE CALL IT

00:55:11.107 --> 00:55:13.009
POCKETBOOK TOUR HERE IN SOUTHERN

00:55:13.076 --> 00:55:14.911
CALIFORNIA. AND WE WANT TO

00:55:14.978 --> 00:55:15.512
TOURISM IN CALIFORNIA. BUT ALL

00:55:15.578 --> 00:55:17.280
THE DATA YOU SHARED LITERALLY IS

00:55:17.347 --> 00:55:19.382
A REMINDER OF THE THINGS WE DO.

00:55:19.449 --> 00:55:22.852
WE JUST APPROVE A $300 BILLION

00:55:22.919 --> 00:55:26.856
BUDGET IN CALIFORNIA. AND TO ME,

00:55:26.923 --> 00:55:28.925
THE VALUES THAT WE HAVE AS

00:55:28.992 --> 00:55:31.161
CALIFORNIANS AND THE FACT THAT

00:55:31.227 --> 00:55:33.096
WE PROTECTED AS AN EXAMPLE, THE

00:55:33.163 --> 00:55:34.964
CSU AND HIGHER EDUCATION IS A

00:55:35.031 --> 00:55:37.200
REMINDER THAT OUR VOICES MATTER.

00:55:37.267 --> 00:55:39.235
IN CALIFORNIA, YOU HAVE

00:55:39.302 --> 00:55:41.271
CHAMPIONS LIKE DAVID ALVAREZ,

00:55:41.337 --> 00:55:43.006
YOUR OTHER ASSEMBLYMEMBER IN SAN

00:55:43.073 --> 00:55:43.606
DIEGO. RIGHT. THAT'S THAT'S

00:55:43.673 --> 00:55:45.275
REALLY BIG IN EDUCATION. AND HE

00:55:45.341 --> 00:55:47.277
ALSO CHAIRS THE GROUP, THE

00:55:47.343 --> 00:55:49.079
CALIFORNIA MEXICO BINATIONAL

00:55:49.145 --> 00:55:50.847
GROUP. RIGHT. BECAUSE TO YOUR

00:55:50.914 --> 00:55:51.514
POINT OF THE DATA YOU SHARED, IT

00:55:51.581 --> 00:55:53.416
HAS AN IMPACT. BUT GOING BACK TO

00:55:53.483 --> 00:55:55.185
EDUCATION AND WHY WE'RE HERE AT

00:55:55.251 --> 00:55:57.120
THE CSU CAMPUS, WE FOUGHT SO

00:55:57.187 --> 00:55:58.855
HARD TO PROTECT BECAUSE THE

00:55:58.922 --> 00:56:00.957
GOVERNOR HAD PROPOSED TO CUT 8%

00:56:01.024 --> 00:56:02.926
OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN OUR

00:56:02.992 --> 00:56:04.894
BUDGET. RIGHT. AND SO, OF

00:56:04.961 --> 00:56:05.528
COURSE, A LOT OF US ARE JUST

00:56:05.595 --> 00:56:08.898
HIGHER EDUCATION AND EDUCATION

00:56:08.965 --> 00:56:12.902
CHAMPIONS. INVESTMENTS THAT WE

00:56:12.969 --> 00:56:13.536
MAKE IN THESE CAMPUSES HAVE AN

00:56:13.603 --> 00:56:16.940
IMPACT IN LOCAL CAMPUS. AS A CSU

00:56:17.006 --> 00:56:17.540
GRADUATE MYSELF, WE HAVE VERY

00:56:17.607 --> 00:56:19.242
DIFFERENT ISSUES AT DOMINGUEZ

00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:21.077
HILLS THAT YOU JUST MENTIONED

00:56:21.144 --> 00:56:22.879
WITH OUR VETERAN COMMUNITY AND

00:56:22.946 --> 00:56:23.513
OTHER COMMUNITIES HERE IN SAN

00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:25.181
MARCOS. SO I THINK IT'S JUST A

00:56:25.248 --> 00:56:27.016
REMINDER OF THE WORK THAT WE

00:56:27.083 --> 00:56:27.684
HAVE TO CONTINUE SUPPORTING. AND

00:56:27.751 --> 00:56:30.854
SO JUST THANK YOU ALL FOR REALLY

00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:34.958
AMPLIFYING THOSE OF HOW WHAT

00:56:35.024 --> 00:56:37.127
YOU'RE DOING HAS AN IMPACT, SO

00:56:37.193 --> 00:56:38.862
THAT WHEN WE HAVE TO MAKE

00:56:38.928 --> 00:56:39.429
DECISIONS OF CUTTING, NOT

00:56:39.496 --> 00:56:41.231
CUTTING STATE RESOURCES, THESE

00:56:41.297 --> 00:56:42.966
ARE THE REMINDERS OF WHY IT'S

00:56:43.032 --> 00:56:43.566
WORKING AND WHY THINGS LIKE

00:56:43.633 --> 00:56:45.435
HOUSING HERE IS GOING TO HAVE AN

00:56:45.502 --> 00:56:47.203
IMPACT FOR YOUR COMMUNITY AND

00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:48.905

STUDENTS AND OUR POPULATION HERE

00:56:51.207 --> 00:56:51.808
TO HAVE THAT ACCESS. RIGHT. IT'S

00:56:51.875 --> 00:56:53.042
NOT JUST FOR IT'S ACCESS AS

00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:55.044
WELL. SORRY, I JUST I'M A VISUAL

00:56:55.111 --> 00:56:56.980
LEARNER AND I JUST YOU JUST KIND

00:56:57.046 --> 00:56:57.580
OF COMPILE EVERYTHING YOU'VE

00:56:57.647 --> 00:56:59.149
SAID. TO WHAT? TO STRIVING TO

00:56:59.215 --> 00:57:01.417
THE CAMPUS AS A REMINDER. BUT

00:57:01.484 --> 00:57:04.988
DOCTOR PATEL. YEAH. THANK YOU.

00:57:05.054 --> 00:57:06.990
YOU THREE PANELISTS HAVE SET UP

00:57:07.056 --> 00:57:09.192
THE HOPE AND THE CHALLENGES

00:57:09.259 --> 00:57:11.094
QUITE WELL. AND I THINK WE'RE

00:57:11.161 --> 00:57:12.929
HERE TO LISTEN TO SOME OF THESE

00:57:12.996 --> 00:57:13.563
IDEAS. I DO HAVE SOME SPECIFIC

00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:16.966
QUESTIONS FOR IN THE SAN DIEGO

00:57:17.033 --> 00:57:19.002
REGION, WE HAVE SEVERAL HIGHER

00:57:19.068 --> 00:57:20.970
INSTITUTIONS OF LEARNING THAT

00:57:21.037 --> 00:57:22.972
ARE DOING SIMILAR WORK TO WHAT

00:57:23.039 --> 00:57:24.974
WE'RE DOING HERE AT SAN MARCOS

00:57:25.041 --> 00:57:27.243
CENTERS AND HUBS. ARE THESE SEEN

00:57:27.310 --> 00:57:30.980
AS COMPETITIVE OR COLLABORATIVE?

00:57:31.047 --> 00:57:31.614
COMPLEMENTARY. AND HOW IS THAT?

00:57:31.681 --> 00:57:33.516
HOW ARE WE PULLING THEM TOGETHER

00:57:33.583 --> 00:57:35.285
TO MAKE SURE WE'RE MEETING ALL

00:57:35.351 --> 00:57:37.287
THE NEEDS OF THE SECTORS THAT WE

00:57:37.353 --> 00:57:39.055
HAVE IMPRESSED? TO KNOW, MR.

00:57:39.122 --> 00:57:41.224
VELASQUEZ, THAT THE SAN DIEGO

00:57:41.291 --> 00:57:43.092
REGION. I DIDN'T KNOW THIS

00:57:43.159 --> 00:57:45.261
BEFORE. IT CAN BOAST BEING ONE

00:57:45.328 --> 00:57:47.130
OF THE TOP REGIONS IN ALMOST

00:57:47.197 --> 00:57:49.132
EVERY SINGLE SECTOR. I ALWAYS

00:57:49.199 --> 00:57:51.201
FELT THAT. BUT TO KNOW IT

00:57:51.267 --> 00:57:53.269
FACTUALLY IS, IS ALSO BRINGS ME

00:57:53.336 --> 00:57:55.471
HOPE THAT WE CAN DO IT HERE IN

00:57:55.538 --> 00:57:57.574
SAN DIEGO. SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO A

00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:59.409
LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT THE OTHER

00:57:59.475 --> 00:57:59.843
UNIVERSITIES, HIGHER

00:57:59.909 --> 00:58:01.344
INSTITUTIONS OF LEARNING HAVE

00:58:01.411 --> 00:58:03.246
OFFERED AND HOW THEY CAN WORK

00:58:03.313 --> 00:58:07.350
TOGETHER? YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE

00:58:07.417 --> 00:58:11.154
THINGS, FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU

00:58:11.221 --> 00:58:13.089
FOR THAT IMPORTANT QUESTION. AND

00:58:13.156 --> 00:58:14.991
I JUST NEED TO PAUSE AND THANK

00:58:15.058 --> 00:58:15.692
YOU FOR YOUR ADVOCACY ON BEHALF

00:58:15.758 --> 00:58:18.995
OF THE BUDGET AND STATE HIGHER

00:58:19.062 --> 00:58:23.032
EDUCATION. IT IT WE FELT IT I

00:58:23.099 --> 00:58:25.368
FELT IT FROM MY COLLEAGUES

00:58:25.435 --> 00:58:27.437
ACROSS SAN DIEGO AND BEYOND. WE

00:58:27.503 --> 00:58:29.572
ARE GRATEFUL. I JUST WANT TO PUT

00:58:29.639 --> 00:58:31.507
THAT OUT THERE. THE THING THAT I

00:58:31.574 --> 00:58:33.343
HAVE REALLY APPRECIATED SINCE

00:58:33.409 --> 00:58:35.311
I'VE COME TO THE SAN DIEGO

00:58:35.378 --> 00:58:37.213
REGION IS THAT HIGHER EDUCATION

00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:39.182
WORKS AS AN ECOSYSTEM, FROM THE

00:58:39.249 --> 00:58:41.417
WAY WE WORK TOGETHER WITH

00:58:41.484 --> 00:58:43.386
PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES ALL ACROSS

00:58:43.453 --> 00:58:45.421
THE WAY IN WHICH WE PARTNER AND

00:58:45.488 --> 00:58:49.058
THE INNOVATION CENTERS ARE NO

00:58:49.125 --> 00:58:49.626
DIFFERENT. GETTING TOGETHER,

00:58:49.692 --> 00:58:53.062
SHARING IDEAS, WORKING TOGETHER.

00:58:53.129 --> 00:58:53.696
SO ONE OF THE THINGS YOU KNOW,

00:58:53.763 --> 00:58:57.066
AND SOMETIMES WE'RE HIGHLIGHTING

00:58:57.133 --> 00:58:59.202
DIFFERENT PIECES OR AREAS AS WE

00:58:59.269 --> 00:59:01.404
MOVE FORWARD WHEN WE OPEN THIS

00:59:01.471 --> 00:59:05.074
CENTER, IT WAS YOU KNOW, IT'S

00:59:05.141 --> 00:59:07.010
NOT THAT THAT WAS A NEW IDEA,

00:59:07.076 --> 00:59:07.610
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

00:59:07.677 --> 00:59:09.479
REALLY PUT AS A HALLMARK OF THIS

00:59:09.545 --> 00:59:11.414
CENTER WAS SOCIAL INNOVATION.

00:59:11.481 --> 00:59:13.216
TRYING TO COME IN AS WE WERE

00:59:13.283 --> 00:59:15.151
WORKING WITH OUR FACULTY TO SEE

00:59:15.218 --> 00:59:17.086
THAT TO COMPLEMENT SO MUCH OF

00:59:17.153 --> 00:59:17.720
WHAT'S OUT THERE. I DON'T KNOW

00:59:17.787 --> 00:59:19.422
IF MY COLLEAGUE HERE HAS

00:59:19.489 --> 00:59:23.192
ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD. SURE. SO

00:59:23.259 --> 00:59:27.130
WE'VE WORKED, FOR INSTANCE, WITH,

00:59:27.196 --> 00:59:31.100
WITH WITH ORGANIZATIONS THAT

00:59:31.167 --> 00:59:33.236
SERVE PEOPLE IN NEED. IN ONE OF

00:59:33.303 --> 00:59:35.238
THEM IS, IS TERRY JUST UP THE

00:59:35.305 --> 00:59:39.108
STREET, WHICH SERVES A RANGE OF

00:59:39.175 --> 00:59:41.110
FOLKS AND SOME WITH ON THE

00:59:41.177 --> 00:59:43.446
SPECTRUM, AND THEY WORK WITH

00:59:43.513 --> 00:59:45.381
THOSE GROUPS AND THEY CALL THEM

00:59:45.448 --> 00:59:47.483
THE NEED KNOWERS. AND THEY'RE

00:59:47.550 --> 00:59:51.120
THE ONES THAT KNOW WHERE

00:59:51.187 --> 00:59:53.189
INNOVATION NEEDS ARE. AND OUR

00:59:53.256 --> 00:59:55.191
CAMPUS THEN WORKS WITH THEM IN

00:59:55.258 --> 00:59:57.226
ORDER TO SOLVE SOME OF THOSE

00:59:57.293 --> 00:59:59.262
PROBLEMS AND PUT THEM OUT IN THE

00:59:59.329 --> 01:00:01.130
PUBLIC SPHERE. IT'S NOT TO MAKE

01:00:01.197 --> 01:00:03.399
NECESSARILY THE ECONOMY TICK, TO

01:00:03.466 --> 01:00:05.101
MAKE PEOPLE'S LIVES BETTER. SO

01:00:05.168 --> 01:00:05.735
THAT'S WHERE THE AN EXAMPLE OF

01:00:05.802 --> 01:00:09.105
THE SOCIAL INNOVATION THAT WE DO

01:00:09.172 --> 01:00:11.174
HERE ON THE CAMPUS. AND JUST TO

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:13.176
PIGGYBACK OFF OF THAT, I THINK

01:00:13.242 --> 01:00:13.810
WHEN WE LOOK AT HOW WE EXPAND

01:00:13.876 --> 01:00:15.378
THE TABLE AND HOW MANY CHAIRS WE

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:17.246
HAVE AROUND THE TABLE, WE CAN

01:00:17.313 --> 01:00:19.182
REALLY SOLVE SOME OF THE

01:00:19.248 --> 01:00:19.816
INTRACTABLE PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE

01:00:19.882 --> 01:00:21.351
EXPERIENCING IN OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:00:21.417 --> 01:00:23.419
IF WE BRING MORE PERSPECTIVES TO

01:00:23.486 --> 01:00:25.121
THE TABLE, AND SOME OF THESE

01:00:25.188 --> 01:00:27.123
CHALLENGES THAT FOLKS IN THE

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:27.790
COMMUNITY ARE EXPERIENCING, THEY

01:00:27.857 --> 01:00:29.392
MAY BE BLIND SPOTS FOR THE

01:00:29.459 --> 01:00:31.194
PEOPLE WHO TYPICALLY SIT AT THE

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:31.694
TABLE. AND THEY MAY NOT

01:00:31.761 --> 01:00:33.463
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S NOT ONLY

01:00:33.529 --> 01:00:35.131
THIS NEED, BUT THIS ECONOMIC

01:00:35.198 --> 01:00:35.732
OPPORTUNITY. FRANKLY, THERE'S

01:00:35.798 --> 01:00:37.533
INCENTIVES ON MULTIPLE SIDES,

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:39.402
NOT JUST MAKING PEOPLE'S LIVES

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:41.170
EASIER, WHICH IS THE MOST NOBLE

01:00:41.237 --> 01:00:41.671
CAUSE, BUT THAT IT'S AN

01:00:41.738 --> 01:00:43.539
INVESTMENT THAT'S WORTHWHILE AND

01:00:43.606 --> 01:00:45.641
WORTH PUTTING RESOURCES TOWARDS,

01:00:45.708 --> 01:00:47.477
ESPECIALLY AS WE LOOK AT ACROSS

01:00:47.543 --> 01:00:49.345
PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEMS. IT'S

01:00:49.412 --> 01:00:51.114
NOT REDUNDANT. IT'S

01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:53.149
COMPLEMENTARY AND SYNERGISTIC.

01:00:53.216 --> 01:00:55.284
ACTUALLY, IF I MIGHT JUST ADD

01:00:55.351 --> 01:00:57.353
ONE MORE PIECE TO THAT, I THINK,

01:00:57.420 --> 01:00:59.489
AND I KNOW THIS HAPPENS ACROSS

01:00:59.555 --> 01:01:01.491
CALIFORNIA. I HAPPEN TO BE IN

01:01:01.557 --> 01:01:03.393
THE SAN DIEGO REGION. I THINK IT

01:01:03.459 --> 01:01:05.561
IS A MODEL OF THAT. WHEN YOU'RE

01:01:05.628 --> 01:01:07.230
TALKING ABOUT THE EDUCATION FROM

01:01:07.296 --> 01:01:09.399
THE FROM THE K-12 EDUCATION

01:01:09.465 --> 01:01:11.300
SECTOR THROUGH THE COMMUNITY

01:01:11.367 --> 01:01:13.302
COLLEGES AND THE FOUR YEAR BUT

01:01:13.369 --> 01:01:17.173
ALSO, YOU KNOW, I, I AS WE WORK

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:19.442
TOGETHER ACROSS UNIVERSITIES IN

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:21.577
THE REGION, TO YOUR POINT ABOUT

01:01:21.644 --> 01:01:23.146
THE COMPLEMENTARY AND WHERE WE

01:01:23.212 --> 01:01:23.813
CAN PARTNER, WHETHER THAT'S WITH

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:27.150
GRANTS, INNOVATION ACROSS THE

01:01:27.216 --> 01:01:29.185
BOARD, THAT'S THE KEY. IT'S NOT

01:01:29.252 --> 01:01:31.154
IT'S NOT ABOUT A ZERO SUM GAME

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:31.821
OR SOME BIG COMPETITION. WE KNOW

01:01:31.888 --> 01:01:35.224
OUR NICHE. WE COMPLEMENT SAN

01:01:35.291 --> 01:01:37.360
DIEGO STATE'S NICHE OR UCSD'S

01:01:37.427 --> 01:01:41.264
NICHE. AND I THINK AS WE LOOK AT

01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:41.931
THESE TOUGH ECONOMIC TIMES RIGHT

01:01:41.998 --> 01:01:43.566
NOW, WE'RE GOING TO LEAN ON

01:01:43.633 --> 01:01:45.535
PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS MORE

01:01:45.601 --> 01:01:47.136
THAN EVER. GOVERNMENT CAN'T DO

01:01:47.203 --> 01:01:49.405
EVERYTHING. AND EVEN IN A IN

01:01:49.472 --> 01:01:51.441
GOOD ECONOMIC TIMES, GOVERNMENT

01:01:51.507 --> 01:01:53.242
CAN'T DO EVERYTHING. SO AS WE

01:01:53.309 --> 01:01:55.244
EXPAND THE ECONOMIC

01:01:55.311 --> 01:01:57.413
OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR PROGRAMS,

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:59.315
LOOKING AT SOCIAL MOBILITY TO

01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:01.250
STRENGTHEN ECONOMY, WE'RE GOING

01:02:01.317 --> 01:02:01.884
TO LEAN ON PRIVATE INDUSTRY MORE

01:02:01.951 --> 01:02:05.455
THAN EVER. TO MR. VELASQUEZ,

01:02:05.521 --> 01:02:07.356
WHAT WOULD YOU IF WE COULD

01:02:07.423 --> 01:02:11.260
IDENTIFY SOME OF THE TOP POLICY

01:02:11.327 --> 01:02:13.463
AREAS THAT YOU COULD ASK US TO

01:02:13.529 --> 01:02:15.398
TAKE BACK TO SACRAMENTO? HOW CAN

01:02:15.465 --> 01:02:17.700
WE HELP STIMULATE THAT AND MAKE

01:02:17.767 --> 01:02:19.569
SURE THAT IT'S ENDURING TO NOT

01:02:19.635 --> 01:02:21.604
ONLY HELP OUR SMALL BUSINESS

01:02:21.671 --> 01:02:23.439
OWNERS AND NOT ONLY HELP OUR

01:02:23.506 --> 01:02:25.274
LOCAL COMMUNITIES, BUT REALLY

01:02:25.341 --> 01:02:25.875
PUSH INNOVATION AND STABILIZE

01:02:25.942 --> 01:02:27.777
OUR BUDGET. SO WE'RE NOT RELYING

01:02:27.844 --> 01:02:31.247
ON THE TOP 1% ALL THE TIME.

01:02:31.314 --> 01:02:31.914
YEAH, I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION.

01:02:31.981 --> 01:02:35.351
AND YES, WE HAVE A LOT OF INPUT

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:35.952
AND FEEDBACK FROM, FROM THE

01:02:36.018 --> 01:02:37.620
PRIVATE INDUSTRY. OBVIOUSLY

01:02:37.687 --> 01:02:39.622
ALONG THOSE LINES, I WOULD SAY,

01:02:39.689 --> 01:02:41.357
GENERALLY SPEAKING, THE

01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:43.259
OVERARCHING THEME THAT WE HEAR

01:02:43.326 --> 01:02:45.361
ACROSS INDUSTRY, ACROSS OUR

01:02:45.428 --> 01:02:49.465
REGION IS FINDING WAYS TO REDUCE

01:02:49.532 --> 01:02:51.534
BARRIERS TO GET DEVELOPMENT AND

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:53.569
PROJECTS ONLINE. SO PERMITTING

01:02:53.636 --> 01:02:55.471
IS A IS A CONSISTENT PAIN POINT

01:02:55.538 --> 01:02:57.440
FOR BUSINESSES, WHETHER THEY'RE

01:02:57.507 --> 01:02:59.275
TRYING TO BUILD A NEW

01:02:59.342 --> 01:03:01.544
LABORATORY, A MANUFACTURING

01:03:01.611 --> 01:03:05.314
SITE, WHAT HAVE YOU. SO I WOULD

01:03:05.381 --> 01:03:05.948
I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE STATE TO

01:03:06.015 --> 01:03:07.617
EXPLORE AREAS WHERE IT CAN

01:03:07.683 --> 01:03:09.318
PARTNER WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT,

01:03:09.385 --> 01:03:13.356
IN PARTICULAR TO IDENTIFY. IT'S

01:03:13.422 --> 01:03:15.258
NOT EVEN REGULATORY BURDEN, BUT

01:03:15.324 --> 01:03:17.326
REPORTING AND PROCESSING THAT

01:03:17.393 --> 01:03:19.428
ADDS TO THE TO THE TIME AND

01:03:19.495 --> 01:03:21.330
COMPLEXITY BY WHICH A COMPANY IS

01:03:21.397 --> 01:03:23.366
THEN SPENDING RESOURCES AND

01:03:23.432 --> 01:03:25.568
DELAYING THE OPERATIONAL, YOU

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:27.270
KNOW, COMMENCEMENT OF THEIR

01:03:27.336 --> 01:03:29.438
PROJECTS AND DELIVERING SERVICES

01:03:29.505 --> 01:03:31.274
AND GOODS TO, TO THE ECONOMY.

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:31.908
THAT IS CONSISTENTLY THE ISSUE

01:03:31.974 --> 01:03:33.543
THAT WE HEAR, WE HEAR THE MOST.

01:03:33.609 --> 01:03:35.711
SO IF THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES TO

01:03:35.778 --> 01:03:37.580
DEVELOP REGULATORY SANDBOXES,

01:03:37.647 --> 01:03:38.181
WHERE WE MIGHT EXPERIMENT WITH

01:03:38.247 --> 01:03:41.384
SOME OF THESE MODIFICATIONS AND

01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:42.051
CHANGES TO PROCESSES TO SEE IF

01:03:42.118 --> 01:03:45.354
WE CAN GET DELIVERY OF

01:03:45.421 --> 01:03:47.423
FACILITIES AND ECONOMIC ENGINES

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:49.458
MORE QUICKLY WITHOUT CREATING

01:03:49.525 --> 01:03:51.694
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND

01:03:51.761 --> 01:03:53.563
SPILLOVER EFFECTS. I THINK THAT

01:03:53.629 --> 01:03:55.498
WOULD BE A VERY POSITIVE AND

01:03:55.565 --> 01:03:57.533
WELCOME OPPORTUNITY TO

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.702
EXPERIMENT AND TEST AND THEN SEE

01:03:59.769 --> 01:04:01.504
WHAT CAN BE SCALED AND AUGMENTED

01:04:01.571 --> 01:04:03.639
AND BUILT UPON. BUT THAT IS, I

01:04:03.706 --> 01:04:04.173
THINK, PROBABLY FIRST AND

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:07.410
FOREMOST WHERE I WOULD START. I

01:04:07.476 --> 01:04:08.010
APPRECIATE THE PERMITTING PART

01:04:08.077 --> 01:04:11.380
THAT YOU'RE GIVING US, BECAUSE I

01:04:11.447 --> 01:04:11.914
ACTUALLY COME FROM LOCAL

01:04:11.981 --> 01:04:13.449
GOVERNMENT MYSELF AND SAT ON

01:04:13.516 --> 01:04:14.050
SOUTH COAST COMMITTEE FOR TWO

01:04:14.116 --> 01:04:17.420
YEARS, AND THAT IN ITSELF WAS A

01:04:17.486 --> 01:04:19.388
LONG EXPERIENCE. IT FELT LIKE 20

01:04:19.455 --> 01:04:20.022
YEARS, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS TWO

01:04:20.089 --> 01:04:21.490
YEARS. BUT THE PERMITTING PART

01:04:21.557 --> 01:04:23.659
THAT WE HAVE A STATE PROBLEM

01:04:23.726 --> 01:04:24.293
WITH PERMITTING. AND SO I THINK

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:25.628
THAT SANDBOX IDEA THAT YOU'RE

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:27.697
MENTIONING, I THINK IT'S GREAT

01:04:27.763 --> 01:04:29.398
FEEDBACK FOR US BECAUSE WE NEED

01:04:29.465 --> 01:04:29.999
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO HOW TO

01:04:30.066 --> 01:04:31.601
COMBAT THAT. RIGHT? I MEAN, IN

01:04:31.667 --> 01:04:33.569
SOUTH COAST, WE HAVE WE HAVE

01:04:33.636 --> 01:04:34.237
PERMITS THAT HAVE BEEN THERE FOR

01:04:34.303 --> 01:04:35.805
YEARS, NOT MONTHS, BUT YEARS.

01:04:35.871 --> 01:04:37.640
AND HOW DOES HOW DO YOU EVEN

01:04:37.707 --> 01:04:39.408
FUNCTION THAT WAY? RIGHT. SO I

01:04:39.475 --> 01:04:40.109
THINK THAT'S THAT'S GOOD IMPACT

01:04:40.176 --> 01:04:41.777
FOR US TO OR INPUT. I'M SORRY

01:04:41.844 --> 01:04:43.779
FOR US TO TAKE BACK AND SAY HOW

01:04:43.846 --> 01:04:45.881
DO WE HOW DO WE CREATE THAT PART

01:04:45.948 --> 01:04:47.516
OF ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE?

01:04:47.583 --> 01:04:48.184
BECAUSE IT IS A PERMITTING ISSUE

01:04:48.251 --> 01:04:49.885

I'M HERE TO TELL YOU ABOUT MY

01:07:39.588 --> 01:07:41.524
MISSION, MY FOUNDER JOURNEY, AND

01:07:41.590 --> 01:07:42.091
HIGHLIGHTING THE INCREDIBLE

01:07:42.158 --> 01:07:43.793
ECOSYSTEM IN SAN DIEGO, AS WELL

01:07:43.859 --> 01:07:45.795
AS SOME OF THE WORK THAT HAS YET

01:07:45.861 --> 01:07:47.663
TO BE DONE. SO A LITTLE

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:49.632
BACKGROUND ON WHY I'M DOING WHAT

01:07:49.698 --> 01:07:51.934
I'M DOING. 75% OF THE US ADULTS

01:07:52.001 --> 01:07:53.936
ARE CHRONICALLY DEHYDRATED.

01:07:54.003 --> 01:07:55.938
ABOUT 10 MILLION SENIORS ARE

01:07:56.005 --> 01:07:57.807
HOSPITALIZED DUE TO DEHYDRATION

01:07:57.873 --> 01:07:59.642
EACH YEAR, AND JUST A 2%

01:07:59.708 --> 01:08:01.610
DECREASE IN WEIGHT DUE TO

01:08:01.677 --> 01:08:02.211
DEHYDRATION CAN SIGNIFICANTLY

01:08:02.278 --> 01:08:05.815
IMPACT THE FUNCTION. 87 MILLION

01:08:05.881 --> 01:08:07.650
PEOPLE IN THE US SUFFER FROM

01:08:07.716 --> 01:08:09.685
CONDITIONS THAT MAKE FAILED TO

01:08:09.752 --> 01:08:10.352
RECEIVE PROPER HYDRATION, SUCH

01:08:10.419 --> 01:08:13.622
AS DEMENTIA, KIDNEY DISEASE,

01:08:13.689 --> 01:08:14.223
DIABETES, AND HEART FAILURE.

01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:15.825
CURRENTLY IN THE CLINIC, WE'RE

01:08:15.891 --> 01:08:17.760
USING SKIN TURGOR OR JUST

01:08:17.827 --> 01:08:19.728
PINCHING THE SKIN OR URINE COLOR

01:08:19.795 --> 01:08:21.664
OR WEIGHTS OR SWOLLEN ANKLES TO

01:08:21.730 --> 01:08:23.899
DETERMINE PROPER HYDRATION. SO

01:08:23.966 --> 01:08:25.668
WE REALLY NEED A BETTER WAY. I

01:08:25.734 --> 01:08:27.837
STARTED THIS JOURNEY IN 2017 AS

01:08:27.903 --> 01:08:29.705
I WAS TRYING TO OPTIMIZE MY OWN

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:31.640
HYDRATION AS AN ATHLETE AND THEN

01:08:31.707 --> 01:08:32.241
AGAIN EXPERIENCING LOW BLOOD

01:08:32.308 --> 01:08:34.076
PRESSURE DURING MY PREGNANCIES.

01:08:34.143 --> 01:08:36.145
I WANTED TO BUY THIS PRODUCT,

01:08:36.212 --> 01:08:39.648
BUT IT DIDN'T EXIST. SO I PUT MY

01:08:39.715 --> 01:08:41.650
PHD TO WORK AND I STARTED

01:08:41.717 --> 01:08:43.752
TINKERING WITH THIS IDEA. BUT I

01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:45.754
WAS AN ACADEMIC SCIENTIST WITH

01:08:45.821 --> 01:08:47.823
NO BUSINESS BACKGROUND, SO I WAS

01:08:47.890 --> 01:08:48.424
EVENTUALLY INTRODUCED TO SAN

01:08:48.491 --> 01:08:51.627
DIEGO NETWORKS SUPPORTING WOMEN

01:08:51.694 --> 01:08:52.228
BUSINESS OWNERS. PEOPLE LIKE

01:08:52.294 --> 01:08:55.631
SELENA HANSON AT HARA HUB AND

01:08:55.698 --> 01:08:57.800
DOCTOR SYLVIA MÀ AT SBDC. DOCTOR

01:08:57.867 --> 01:08:59.935
MÀ BECAME A CLOSE MENTOR AND

01:09:00.002 --> 01:09:02.004
THEN AN ANGEL INVESTOR, AND THEN

01:09:02.071 --> 01:09:03.706
A DEAR FRIEND. SHE'S ALSO THE

01:09:03.772 --> 01:09:04.173
FOUNDER OF THE STELLAR

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:05.941
FOUNDATION, WHICH IS A NONPROFIT

01:09:06.008 --> 01:09:07.710
THAT SUPPORTS WOMEN FOUNDERS AND

01:09:07.776 --> 01:09:09.879
WOMEN INVESTORS. AND I WENT

01:09:09.945 --> 01:09:11.847
THROUGH THEIR ACCELERATOR

01:09:11.914 --> 01:09:13.983
PROGRAM THAT THEN I MET OTHER

01:09:14.049 --> 01:09:15.918
INVESTORS AND OTHER MENTORS,

01:09:15.985 --> 01:09:17.953
EVENTUALLY MADE IT AS A FINALIST

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:19.755
TO THE FIRST EVER SAN DIEGO

01:09:19.822 --> 01:09:21.724
ANGEL CONFERENCE IN 2019, AND

01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:23.859
I'VE SINCE RECEIVED GRANTS FROM

01:09:23.926 --> 01:09:26.061
THE SBDC FOR MARKETING CONNECTED

01:09:26.128 --> 01:09:27.663
WITH THE CALIFORNIA

01:09:27.730 --> 01:09:29.732
MANUFACTURING NETWORK AND MANY,

01:09:29.798 --> 01:09:30.366
MANY AMAZING MENTORS THAT MADE

01:09:30.432 --> 01:09:33.969
IT ALL POSSIBLE. MY JOURNEY HAS

01:09:34.036 --> 01:09:35.838
COME WITH SOME INCREDIBLE

01:09:35.905 --> 01:09:37.706
CHALLENGES THAT A WOMAN OF COLOR

01:09:37.773 --> 01:09:38.374
FACES, ESPECIALLY AS A HARDWARE

01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:40.142
TECH FOUNDER. IN THE PAST FIVE

01:09:40.209 --> 01:09:42.077
YEARS, ONLY ABOUT 2% OF VENTURE

01:09:42.144 --> 01:09:43.779
CAPITAL GOES TO WOMEN FOUNDED

01:09:43.846 --> 01:09:45.881
COMPANIES. WHILE WOMEN LED

01:09:45.948 --> 01:09:46.382
COMPANIES CONSISTENTLY

01:09:46.448 --> 01:09:47.883

COMPANIES BY 63% ON RETURN OF

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:52.254
INVESTMENT. THIS IS A MISSED

01:09:52.321 --> 01:09:54.123
ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY THAT HAS

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:55.925
NOT BEEN PROPERLY ADDRESSED. OF

01:09:55.991 --> 01:09:58.060
THOSE RECEIVING VENTURE FUNDING,

01:09:58.127 --> 01:10:01.864
ONLY ABOUT 2 TO 3% RAISE MORE

01:10:01.931 --> 01:10:03.766

10% OF US PATENTS ARE OWNED BY

01:10:04.466 --> 01:10:06.135

YEARS, HYDROSTATICS HAS RECEIVED

PUBLISHED IN EUROPE AND CHINA,

01:10:13.976 --> 01:10:14.577

01:10:14.643 --> 01:10:16.211
OF OUR FIRST PRODUCT, THE GECKO

01:10:16.278 --> 01:10:18.080
WATCH, IN 2024, FOCUSED ON

01:10:18.147 --> 01:10:20.082
SERVING OLDER ADULTS. WE'VE ALSO

RECEIVED CLOSE TO 500,000 IN

ABOUT 5 MILLION IN PRIVATE

01:10:30.225 --> 01:10:32.094
INVESTMENTS. MOST PEOPLE WOULD

01:10:32.161 --> 01:10:33.829
CALL ME A SUCCESS STORY, AND

01:10:33.896 --> 01:10:35.898
FRANKLY, SO WOULD I, BECAUSE

01:10:35.965 --> 01:10:37.866
I'VE NEVER IMAGINED I'D GET THIS

01:10:37.933 --> 01:10:40.035
FAR. BRINGING A PRODUCT FROM AN

01:10:40.102 --> 01:10:42.304
IDEA TO MARKET. I'VE LEARNED SO

01:10:42.371 --> 01:10:44.073
MUCH AND MET SO MANY AMAZING

01:10:44.139 --> 01:10:46.141
PEOPLE, BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT

01:10:46.208 --> 01:10:48.077
WONDER HOW MUCH FASTER, HOW MUCH

01:10:48.143 --> 01:10:50.145
FARTHER I COULD HAVE AND STILL

01:10:50.212 --> 01:10:52.014
GO IN GROWING MY TEAM AND

01:10:52.081 --> 01:10:54.116
BUILDING OUR PRODUCTS. IF I HAD

01:10:54.183 --> 01:10:56.085
MORE ACCESS TO CAPITAL, OR IF I

01:10:56.151 --> 01:10:58.053
DIDN'T HAVE TO WASTE MY TIME

01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:00.022
ANSWERING BIASED QUESTIONS FROM

01:11:00.089 --> 01:11:01.790
INVESTORS ABOUT WHO'S TAKING

01:11:01.857 --> 01:11:04.026
CARE OF MY KIDS, OR IF I'M EVEN

01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:05.995
WORKING FULL TIME. I DO KNOW

01:11:06.061 --> 01:11:08.063
THAT I OWE MY SUCCESS TO MY

01:11:08.130 --> 01:11:10.065
SUPPORT NETWORK, THE INCREDIBLE

01:11:10.132 --> 01:11:11.834

01:11:14.069 --> 01:11:15.838
SUPPORTED ME FROM DAY ONE. AND

01:11:15.904 --> 01:11:17.906

LOVED ONES SEE OUR HYDRATION

01:11:19.842 --> 01:11:20.342

01:11:22.277 --> 01:11:24.213

01:11:24.279 --> 01:11:25.881
THAT WE'RE DOING, WE'RE

01:11:25.948 --> 01:11:26.515
EQUIPPING THE NEXT GENERATION

01:11:26.582 --> 01:11:27.883
WITH THE KNOWLEDGE FOR A

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:28.417
HEALTHIER AND LONGER LIFE

01:11:28.484 --> 01:11:30.019
THROUGH HYDRATION. THESE DAYS,

01:11:30.085 --> 01:11:34.023
I'M GIVING BACK BY GIVING BACK

01:11:34.089 --> 01:11:35.791
TO THE COMMUNITY, BY SITTING ON

01:11:35.858 --> 01:11:36.458

BUSINESSES IN SAN DIEGO, I HOPE

01:11:41.997 --> 01:11:42.564
THAT MY STORY INSPIRES YOU TO

01:11:42.631 --> 01:11:44.099
CONTINUE TO INVEST IN WOMEN

01:11:44.166 --> 01:11:46.035

FOUNDERS LIKE ME. THANK YOU. I'M

01:11:53.909 --> 01:11:56.011
GOING TO JUST MAKE A QUICK

01:11:56.078 --> 01:11:58.080
COMMENT. I I'VE ALWAYS TOLD

01:11:58.147 --> 01:11:59.782
PEOPLE OUR SMALL BUSINESSES ARE

01:11:59.848 --> 01:12:00.416
WHAT MAKES CALIFORNIA THRIVE. I

01:12:00.482 --> 01:12:02.151
KNOW THERE'S A LOT THAT GOES ON

01:12:02.217 --> 01:12:04.053
IN OUR STATE. WE THINK WE'RE

01:12:04.119 --> 01:12:04.586
IMPORTANT AS THE ELECTED

01:12:04.653 --> 01:12:06.188
OFFICIALS, BUT REALLY OUR SMALL

01:12:06.255 --> 01:12:07.890
BUSINESSES ARE. AND YOU'RE JUST

01:12:07.956 --> 01:12:09.858
AN EXACT EXAMPLE OF THAT AND

01:12:09.925 --> 01:12:10.492
THAT GREATNESS THAT WE HAVE IN

01:12:10.559 --> 01:12:12.061
OUR STATE. SO I JUST WANT TO

01:12:12.127 --> 01:12:13.796
ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR GREATNESS AND

01:12:13.862 --> 01:12:15.864
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, SIR.

01:12:15.931 --> 01:12:18.100
HI. MY NAME IS SVEN DAVISON. I'M

01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:20.135
CO-FOUNDER AND COO OF AMAYA,

01:12:20.202 --> 01:12:24.173
INC. WE MAKE EDIBLE CUPS, WE

01:12:24.239 --> 01:12:26.375
TAKE BREWER'S SPENT GRAIN. WE

01:12:26.442 --> 01:12:28.110
MAKE THAT A SHELF STABLE

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:30.012
SUBSTANCE. WE TURN THAT INTO A

01:12:30.079 --> 01:12:32.181
FLOUR. WE ALSO TAKE OATS FROM

01:12:32.247 --> 01:12:34.349
OAT MILK PRODUCTION AND P STARCH

01:12:34.416 --> 01:12:36.085
FROM PEA PROTEIN PRODUCTION.

01:12:36.151 --> 01:12:37.920
THAT GETS PUT INTO OUR EDIBLE

01:12:37.986 --> 01:12:39.788
CUP, WHICH CAN HOLD BOILING

01:12:39.855 --> 01:12:40.422
WATER. IT DOESN'T LEAK FOR 72

01:12:40.489 --> 01:12:42.291
HOURS. YOU CAN FREEZE IT, YOU

01:12:42.357 --> 01:12:44.093
CAN COOK WITH IT, YOU CAN

01:12:44.159 --> 01:12:45.894
MICROWAVE IN IT. IT DOESN'T

01:12:45.961 --> 01:12:46.528
CHANGE ITS PROPERTIES FOR THREE

01:12:46.595 --> 01:12:49.898
DAYS. I MEAN, WHEN YOU DO THAT

01:12:49.965 --> 01:12:50.532
AND WE HAVE DIFFERENT FLAVORS,

01:12:50.599 --> 01:12:53.902
DIFFERENT SIZES. RIGHT NOW WE'RE

01:12:53.969 --> 01:12:58.040
AN R&amp;D FACILITY IN VISTA. STORY

01:12:58.107 --> 01:13:00.242
ON HOW WE BASICALLY STARTED IS

01:13:00.309 --> 01:13:02.244
I'M A 20 YEAR ENTERTAINMENT

01:13:02.311 --> 01:13:04.146
EXECUTIVE. I WORKED AT 20TH

01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:06.281
CENTURY FOX, SONY AND PARAMOUNT.

01:13:06.348 --> 01:13:09.918
I MET MY WIFE AND THE CEO AND

01:13:09.985 --> 01:13:12.221
OWNER OF AM I. DURING THAT TIME,

01:13:12.287 --> 01:13:14.123
SHE WAS GENERAL MANAGER AT

01:13:14.189 --> 01:13:15.891
PANASONIC, OVERSEEING

01:13:15.958 --> 01:13:17.993
MANUFACTURING FOR BLU RAYS AND

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:20.129
DVDS. WE DIDN'T WANT OUR SON

01:13:20.195 --> 01:13:22.264
RAISED IN THE ENTERTAINMENT

01:13:22.331 --> 01:13:24.333
WORLD, ESPECIALLY WHEN HE CAME

01:13:24.399 --> 01:13:26.101
HOME AND WAS COMPARING HIS SHOES

01:13:26.168 --> 01:13:28.203
AND FASHION AT LIKE THREE YEARS

01:13:28.270 --> 01:13:30.072
OLD AND WANTING TO KNOW WHY WE

01:13:30.139 --> 01:13:30.606
WEREN'T BUYING HIM MORE

01:13:30.672 --> 01:13:32.141
FASHIONABLE SHOES, WE FELT LIKE

01:13:32.207 --> 01:13:34.042
HE SHOULD GET OUT OF THAT

01:13:34.109 --> 01:13:35.911
SYSTEM. CAME DOWN HERE TO BE SIX

01:13:35.978 --> 01:13:36.545
BLOCKS AWAY FROM MY IN-LAWS.

01:13:36.612 --> 01:13:38.280
IT'S BEEN A WONDERFUL COMMUNITY

01:13:38.347 --> 01:13:40.182
DOWN HERE, BUT CHANGING CAREERS

01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:42.417
WAS INTERESTING FOR US, AND WE

01:13:42.484 --> 01:13:44.219
WANTED TO DO SOMETHING THAT WAS

01:13:44.286 --> 01:13:46.355
BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND

01:13:46.421 --> 01:13:48.290
WOULD CHALLENGE THE IDEAS BEHIND

01:13:48.357 --> 01:13:51.894
FOOD WASTE AND BEHIND, YOU KNOW,

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:55.898
JUST CONVENTIONAL TRASH. SO WE

01:13:55.964 --> 01:13:58.066
DISCOVERED A COMPANY IN BULGARIA

01:13:58.133 --> 01:14:00.102
IN 2020 THAT DOES MAKE AN EDIBLE

01:14:00.169 --> 01:14:02.104
CUP. BUT AS SOON AS WE BECAME

01:14:02.171 --> 01:14:04.106
THEIR SOLE IMPORTERS, WE FOUND

01:14:04.173 --> 01:14:04.807
OUT THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT

01:14:04.873 --> 01:14:06.475
WE COULD IMPROVE. ONE, IT WAS

01:14:06.542 --> 01:14:08.177
ACTUALLY MADE FROM VIRGIN GRAIN.

01:14:08.243 --> 01:14:09.912
SO WE FELT LIKE WE SHOULD

01:14:09.978 --> 01:14:10.546
INTRODUCE THE UPCYCLED PORTION

01:14:10.612 --> 01:14:14.016
OF THAT TO THE PACKAGING WAS NOT

01:14:14.082 --> 01:14:14.516
SUSTAINABLE. IT WAS NOT

01:14:14.583 --> 01:14:16.185
RECYCLABLE. SO WE FELT LIKE THAT

01:14:16.251 --> 01:14:18.020
WE SHOULD CHANGE THAT TOO. AND

01:14:18.086 --> 01:14:18.687
THEN THIRD IS WE FELT LIKE THE

01:14:18.754 --> 01:14:20.455
CARBON FOOTPRINT, IMPORTING IT

01:14:20.522 --> 01:14:22.024
FROM BULGARIA WAS KIND OF

01:14:22.090 --> 01:14:24.159
STRANGE. IT WASN'T REALLY IT WAS

01:14:24.226 --> 01:14:26.128
KIND OF ANTI MESSAGE. SO WE

01:14:26.195 --> 01:14:28.130
PITCHED THEM THIS IDEA. WE

01:14:28.197 --> 01:14:30.165
OFFERED TO LICENSE THE

01:14:30.232 --> 01:14:31.900
TECHNOLOGY AND THEY DECIDED NO,

01:14:31.967 --> 01:14:32.467
THEY JUST WANTED US TO BE A

01:14:32.534 --> 01:14:35.904
DISTRIBUTOR. SO MY WIFE WENT OFF

01:14:35.971 --> 01:14:38.106
AND FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO THIS A

01:14:38.173 --> 01:14:40.142
BETTER WAY AND FILED A PATENT

01:14:40.209 --> 01:14:42.010
WHICH WAS ISSUED TO US JUST BACK

01:14:42.077 --> 01:14:46.281
IN MAY. AND WE BEGAN A LITTLE

01:14:46.348 --> 01:14:50.118
R&amp;D FACILITY HERE IN VISTA. LONG

01:14:50.185 --> 01:14:52.487
STORY. WE AT FIRST WERE GOING TO

01:14:52.554 --> 01:14:54.489
BUILD A FACILITY HERE IN VISTA.

01:14:54.556 --> 01:14:56.225
BUT, YOU KNOW, THE CAPITAL

01:14:56.291 --> 01:14:58.160
OUTPUT FOR THAT WAS RATHER

01:14:58.227 --> 01:15:00.028
LARGE. SO WE STARTED LOOKING AT

01:15:00.095 --> 01:15:02.264
CO-MANUFACTURERS. MEANWHILE, WE

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:04.266
WERE CREATING A MACHINE, OR AT

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:06.134
LEAST WE'RE LOOKING AT A MACHINE

01:15:06.201 --> 01:15:06.702
AT A PLACE CALLED BUEHLER.

01:15:06.768 --> 01:15:10.005
THEY'RE A HUGE INDUSTRIAL BAKING

01:15:10.072 --> 01:15:12.307
FACILITY. MAKE BAKING MACHINES

01:15:12.374 --> 01:15:16.044
IN AUSTRIA. THAT WAS A LITTLE

01:15:16.111 --> 01:15:18.013
BIT TIME CONSUMING TO DO THAT.

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:18.680
SO ONE OF OUR BOARD OF ADVISORS

01:15:18.747 --> 01:15:20.449
HAD A LOT OF CONNECTIONS AT

01:15:20.515 --> 01:15:22.217
FOXCONN, AND HE HAD SET UP ALL

01:15:22.284 --> 01:15:24.186
THE MANUFACTURING FOR IPADS AND

01:15:24.253 --> 01:15:24.820
IPHONES, AND HE ACTUALLY SAID

01:15:24.887 --> 01:15:26.388
FOXCONN COULD DO THIS FOR US,

01:15:26.455 --> 01:15:28.257
AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE A C 

01:15:28.323 --> 01:15:30.192
LICENSE WITH FOXCONN TO CREATE

01:15:30.259 --> 01:15:32.294
THIS MACHINE. AND NOW I FAST

01:15:32.361 --> 01:15:34.229
FORWARD TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY.

01:15:34.296 --> 01:15:36.031
WE WERE ABOUT TO BRING THIS

01:15:36.098 --> 01:15:38.100
MACHINE IN IN THE SPRING, BUT

01:15:38.166 --> 01:15:40.402
THE TARIFF SITUATION, AT LEAST

01:15:40.469 --> 01:15:44.239
IN APRIL, CREATED 210% TARIFF ON

01:15:44.306 --> 01:15:46.041
THE MACHINE BECAUSE TARIFFS ARE

01:15:46.108 --> 01:15:46.608
STACKABLE. SO RIGHT NOW THE

01:15:46.675 --> 01:15:48.477
TARIFF IN CHINA IS 40%, THEN

01:15:48.543 --> 01:15:50.412
IT'S A 50% ANYTHING MADE FROM

01:15:50.479 --> 01:15:52.481
STEEL AND ALUMINUM. THERE'S ALSO

01:15:52.547 --> 01:15:54.316
A TARIFF ON BAKING PRODUCTS

01:15:54.383 --> 01:15:56.218
RIGHT NOW, WHICH IS A 25%.

01:15:56.285 --> 01:15:58.287
YOU'RE AT 115%. SO TO BRING THIS

01:15:58.353 --> 01:16:00.322
MACHINE IN DID NOT MAKE ANY

01:16:00.389 --> 01:16:04.092
SENSE. SO WE PIVOTED IN APRIL

01:16:04.159 --> 01:16:04.660
ORIGINALLY BECAUSE WE HAVE

01:16:04.726 --> 01:16:06.461
PATENTS AND WE HAVE A LICENSING

01:16:06.528 --> 01:16:08.563
MODEL. WE ALWAYS WANTED TO PROVE

01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:10.265
THE MODEL HERE IN SOUTHERN

01:16:10.332 --> 01:16:12.034
CALIFORNIA THEN LICENSED THIS

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:14.036
AGAIN, THE CARBON FOOTPRINT

01:16:14.102 --> 01:16:14.670
LICENSED THESE FACILITIES FROM

01:16:14.736 --> 01:16:16.471
RESCUING SPENT GRAIN OR ACTUALLY

01:16:16.538 --> 01:16:18.473
ANY LOCAL SUBSTANCE. WE FOUND

01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:20.142
OUT OTHER WAYS TO MAKE THE CUPS

01:16:20.208 --> 01:16:22.144
WITH OTHER LOCAL TYPES OF

01:16:22.210 --> 01:16:24.479
SOURCES AND LICENSES IN OTHER

01:16:24.546 --> 01:16:26.481
PLACES. SO BECAUSE OF THE

01:16:26.548 --> 01:16:28.517
TARIFFS WE ARE NOW ACTUALLY

01:16:28.583 --> 01:16:30.285
LOOKING AT, WE'VE ACTUALLY

01:16:30.352 --> 01:16:32.154
REVERSED THE MODEL. AND WE WERE

01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:32.688
TALKING WITH ABOUT FOUR

01:16:32.754 --> 01:16:34.089
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES RIGHT NOW TO

01:16:34.156 --> 01:16:34.656
LAND THE MACHINE THERE. THE

01:16:34.723 --> 01:16:38.026
MACHINE IS DONE. IT'S AT WORKS

01:16:38.093 --> 01:16:40.362
AT 95% CAPACITY. WE YOU KNOW,

01:16:40.429 --> 01:16:42.431
IT'S ANYWAY, WE'RE QUITE HAPPY

01:16:42.497 --> 01:16:43.031
WITH THE PRODUCT THAT FOXCONN

01:16:43.098 --> 01:16:44.566
MADE FOR US, BUT WE'RE KIND OF

01:16:44.633 --> 01:16:48.036
STUCK RIGHT NOW IN A ROCK AND A

01:16:48.103 --> 01:16:48.704
HARD PLACE. SO ALL OF THAT SAID,

01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:50.572
WHEN WE MOVED DOWN HERE FROM

01:16:50.639 --> 01:16:54.309
CALIFORNIA, SORRY, LOS ANGELES.

01:16:54.376 --> 01:16:58.313
I KNOW I'M. ANYWAY, WE RAN INTO

01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:00.515
INNOVATE 78 CONNECT, STARTUP SAN

01:17:00.582 --> 01:17:04.186
DIEGO, SBC. THEY'VE BEEN

01:17:04.252 --> 01:17:06.154
FANTASTIC FOR US. THEY FOUND US

01:17:06.221 --> 01:17:06.788
ACCOUNTANTS, LAWYERS TO HELP US

01:17:06.855 --> 01:17:10.125
WITH CAPITAL RAISE. ACTUALLY,

01:17:10.192 --> 01:17:12.160
BOBBY EDELMAN HELPED US WITH A

01:17:12.227 --> 01:17:12.828
FEASIBILITY STUDY. YOU KNOW, WE

01:17:12.894 --> 01:17:14.463
GOT FOR FREE, WHICH WAS ACTUALLY

01:17:14.529 --> 01:17:15.097
A GLOWING REPORT ON OUR ENTIRE

01:17:15.163 --> 01:17:16.598
BUSINESS MODEL. WE GOT CONNECTED

01:17:16.665 --> 01:17:20.302
WITH CLIMATE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE

01:17:20.369 --> 01:17:22.304
TECH, AND WE GOT A LOAN APPROVED

01:17:22.371 --> 01:17:24.473
FOR 80% OF THE $5 MILLION. WE'VE

01:17:24.539 --> 01:17:28.176
HAD FANTASTIC NETWORK OF HELP

01:17:28.243 --> 01:17:30.345
HERE, AND I CAN'T IMAGINE US

01:17:30.412 --> 01:17:32.280
DOING IT WITHOUT ANY OF THESE

01:17:32.347 --> 01:17:34.516
SOURCES. SO IT WAS VITAL TO OUR

01:17:34.583 --> 01:17:38.153
ENTIRE PATH TO GETTING HERE.

01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:40.555
THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT. OF

01:17:40.622 --> 01:17:42.257
COURSE, YOU JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT

01:17:42.324 --> 01:17:42.891
WHY WE LOVE THE SBDC AND THE

01:17:42.958 --> 01:17:44.493
WORK THAT THEY DO THROUGHOUT OUR

01:17:44.559 --> 01:17:46.561
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND OF

01:17:46.628 --> 01:17:48.397
COURSE, WE WON'T BE DISCUSSING

01:17:48.463 --> 01:17:50.165
TARIFFS TODAY, BUT YOU'RE THE

01:17:50.232 --> 01:17:50.632
EVIDENCE OF WHY THIS

01:17:50.699 --> 01:17:52.334
CONVERSATION IS NEEDS TO BE HAD

01:17:52.401 --> 01:17:54.536
OR IS BEING HAD IN SACRAMENTO AS

01:17:54.603 --> 01:17:55.203
WELL, BECAUSE IT'S IMPACTING OUR

01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:56.605
SMALL BUSINESSES AND THEN OUR

01:17:56.671 --> 01:17:58.540

SMALL BUSINESS SEEKING SUPPORT.

01:18:36.445 --> 01:18:38.213
WE RECEIVE FUNDING FROM THE SBA

01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:40.148
AND SB TAP. I ALSO HAVE THE

01:18:40.215 --> 01:18:40.816
FORTUNE TO SERVE AS A GOVERNOR'S

01:18:40.882 --> 01:18:42.517

ECONOMIC EQUITY COMMITTEE. AND

01:18:48.957 --> 01:18:50.492
I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT SENATOR

01:18:50.559 --> 01:18:52.461
PATEL WAS ONE OF OUR FORMER

01:18:52.527 --> 01:18:54.563
COLLEAGUES, A GOOD FORTUNE FOR

01:18:54.629 --> 01:18:56.631
US TO GET ELECTED, UNFORTUNATE

01:18:56.698 --> 01:18:57.165
FOR US TO LOSE YOU ON THE

01:18:57.232 --> 01:18:58.633
COMMITTEE, BUT HAPPY TO SEE YOU

01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:00.335
CARRY THOSE POLICIES ON IN

01:19:00.402 --> 01:19:02.437
COMMITTEES LIKE THIS AS WELL. SO

01:19:02.504 --> 01:19:04.439
I'M HONORED TO SHARE INSIGHTS

01:19:04.506 --> 01:19:05.040
FROM THE GROUND, PARTICULARLY

01:19:05.107 --> 01:19:06.675
FROM SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS

01:19:06.741 --> 01:19:08.443
WORKING WITH WORKING FAMILIES

01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:10.278
AND IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES,

01:19:10.345 --> 01:19:10.846
NAVIGATING TODAY'S COST OF

01:19:10.912 --> 01:19:12.714
LIVING IN THE SAN DIEGO REGION.

01:19:12.781 --> 01:19:16.384
AND SO THIS STUDY THAT I'LL

01:19:16.451 --> 01:19:18.453
QUICKLY GO OVER AND THEN SOME

01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:19.087
SOLUTIONS, BUT IT'S A REGIONAL

01:19:19.154 --> 01:19:20.689
OVERVIEW. WHILE THIS OVERVIEW IS

01:19:20.755 --> 01:19:22.290
FOR ALL SMALL BUSINESSES IN OUR

01:19:22.357 --> 01:19:24.292
REGION, I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT

01:19:24.359 --> 01:19:26.261
THAT A STUDY WE PRODUCED WITH

01:19:26.328 --> 01:19:28.296
AAPI DATA SHOWED THAT AAPI SMALL

01:19:28.363 --> 01:19:28.864
BUSINESSES IN THE SAN DIEGO

01:19:28.930 --> 01:19:30.699
REGION REPRESENT MORE THAN $5

01:19:30.765 --> 01:19:32.434
BILLION IN ECONOMIC IMPACT,

01:19:32.501 --> 01:19:34.569
WHICH HAS RESULTED IN ABOUT

01:19:34.636 --> 01:19:38.273
90,000 JOBS. SO STATEWIDE, AAPI

01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:38.840
BUSINESSES HAVE AN ECONOMIC

01:19:38.907 --> 01:19:42.277
IMPACT OF OVER $200 BILLION.

01:19:42.344 --> 01:19:42.911
THAT IS ONE THIRD OF ALL ASIAN

01:19:42.978 --> 01:19:44.479
BUSINESSES IN THE NATION. I

01:19:44.546 --> 01:19:46.414
MEAN, SIMPLY PUT, A MORE

01:19:46.481 --> 01:19:48.450
INCLUSIVE AND EQUITABLE ECONOMY

01:19:48.517 --> 01:19:50.285
IS BETTER FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS,

01:19:50.352 --> 01:19:52.487
SOMETHING I KNOW YOU ADVOCATE

01:19:52.554 --> 01:19:56.525
FOR QUITE FREQUENTLY. SO NOW FOR

01:19:56.591 --> 01:19:58.360
ALL SMALL BUSINESS FIRMS. THE

01:19:58.426 --> 01:19:59.027
STUDY WAS PRODUCED FOR ALL SMALL

01:19:59.094 --> 01:20:00.629
BUSINESSES IN THE SAN DIEGO

01:20:00.695 --> 01:20:02.664
COUNTY REGION. NOT ALL OF IT'S

01:20:02.731 --> 01:20:04.666
VERY GLOWING, BUT IT IS A GOOD

01:20:04.733 --> 01:20:06.535
SNAPSHOT IN TIME FOR US. NEARLY

01:20:06.601 --> 01:20:08.603
4 IN 10 LOCAL BUSINESSES ARE

01:20:08.670 --> 01:20:10.272
EITHER CONSIDERING OR ACTIVELY

01:20:10.338 --> 01:20:12.340
PLANNING TO RELOCATE, OR

01:20:12.407 --> 01:20:12.941
RELOCATION IS EVEN HIGHER FOR

01:20:13.008 --> 01:20:14.743
ASIAN BUSINESSES, WHICH IS ABOUT

01:20:14.809 --> 01:20:16.545
51% ACTIVELY CONSIDERING TO

01:20:16.611 --> 01:20:17.179
MOVE. AND BLACK BUSINESSES WAS

01:20:17.245 --> 01:20:20.582
ABOUT 44%. CONFIDENCE IN

01:20:20.649 --> 01:20:21.249
BUSINESS VIABILITY IS LOWER YEAR

01:20:21.316 --> 01:20:24.486
OVER YEAR. ONLY 13% REPORT

01:20:24.553 --> 01:20:28.390
CONFIDENCE STAYING AFLOAT IN SAN

01:20:28.456 --> 01:20:28.957
DIEGO, DOWN FROM A STRONGER

01:20:29.024 --> 01:20:30.492
POSITION LAST YEAR. SOME OF THE

01:20:30.559 --> 01:20:32.494
CONFIDENCE IN PARTICULARLY WITH

01:20:32.561 --> 01:20:34.696
FIRMS WITH ABOUT $75,000 OR LESS

01:20:34.763 --> 01:20:36.898
IN HOUSEHOLD INCOME. THE RISING

01:20:36.965 --> 01:20:38.800
RELOCATION INTENT APPEARS TO BE

01:20:38.867 --> 01:20:40.569
TIED TO SPIKES FROM WAGE

01:20:40.635 --> 01:20:42.537
MANDATES AND TRADE UNCERTAINTY,

01:20:42.604 --> 01:20:46.441
AS WE'VE HEARD TODAY. AND I KNOW

01:20:46.508 --> 01:20:48.276
YOU HEARD EARLIER FROM THE EDC

01:20:48.343 --> 01:20:48.944
AND OTHERS THAT HIRING REMAINS

01:20:49.010 --> 01:20:50.612
THE NUMBER ONE CONSTRAINT. 58%

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:52.881
OF BUSINESSES CAN'T CAN'T FIND

01:20:52.948 --> 01:20:56.451
QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, 55% SAY

01:20:56.518 --> 01:20:57.018
DEVELOPING TALENT IS ALSO A

01:20:57.085 --> 01:20:58.887
MAJOR CHALLENGE. AND HIGH GROWTH

01:20:58.954 --> 01:21:00.589
SECTORS LIKE LOGISTICS,

01:21:00.655 --> 01:21:02.457
HEALTHCARE AND SERVICES ARE

01:21:02.524 --> 01:21:02.991
UNDER THE MOST AMOUNT OF

01:21:03.058 --> 01:21:06.394
PRESSURE. BUSINESSES CITE

01:21:06.461 --> 01:21:06.861
PERMITTING DELAYS AND

01:21:06.928 --> 01:21:08.630
INCONSISTENT PROGRAM DELIVERY AS

01:21:08.697 --> 01:21:10.532
TOP FRUSTRATIONS. PUBLIC

01:21:10.599 --> 01:21:12.400
TRAINING PROGRAMS ARE NOT

01:21:12.467 --> 01:21:14.402
SCALING FAST ENOUGH TO MEET THE

01:21:14.469 --> 01:21:16.504
DEMANDS OF OUR ECONOMY, AND

01:21:16.571 --> 01:21:18.707
PUBLIC TRAINING PROGRAMS ARE NOT

01:21:18.773 --> 01:21:20.875
SCALING FAST ENOUGH IN TERMS OF

01:21:20.942 --> 01:21:22.644
BEING ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:24.879
HAVE, IN TERMS OF AVERAGE TIME

01:21:24.946 --> 01:21:26.548
TO FILL SKILLED ROLES,

01:21:26.615 --> 01:21:28.783
BUSINESSES ARE AWARE OF SUPPORT

01:21:28.850 --> 01:21:30.719
PROGRAMS BUT AREN'T ENGAGING

01:21:30.785 --> 01:21:32.587
WITH THEM, AND THE GAP STEMS

01:21:32.654 --> 01:21:34.389
FROM COMPLEXITY, UNCLEAR

01:21:34.456 --> 01:21:34.990
OUTCOMES. AND QUITE FRANKLY,

01:21:35.056 --> 01:21:40.428
RIGHT NOW, A LOT OF POOR TIMING.

01:21:40.495 --> 01:21:40.962
SO SOME OF THE INFORMATION

01:21:41.029 --> 01:21:42.764
REGARDING SOME OF OUR LANGUAGE

01:21:42.831 --> 01:21:44.432
SERVICE GAPS WE'VE SEEN IN THE

01:21:44.499 --> 01:21:45.066
COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO, AMONG ONE

01:21:45.133 --> 01:21:46.835
OF THE LARGEST GAPS IS LANGUAGE,

01:21:46.901 --> 01:21:48.770
CULTURALLY COMPETENT PROGRAMS,

01:21:48.837 --> 01:21:50.472
MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE ALL

01:21:50.538 --> 01:21:52.607
TAILORED FOR OUR DIFFERENT

01:21:52.674 --> 01:21:53.241
COMMUNITIES, WHICH I KNOW WE DO

01:21:53.308 --> 01:21:54.509
A LOT OF WITHIN THE SBDC

01:21:54.576 --> 01:21:58.480
NETWORK. AND SOME OF THIS YOU

01:21:58.546 --> 01:21:59.114
HEARD EARLIER. SO I'LL MOVE A

01:21:59.180 --> 01:22:00.815
LITTLE BIT QUICKER THROUGH THIS,

01:22:00.882 --> 01:22:04.552
BUT MUCH OF WHICH WE'VE SEEN.

01:22:04.619 --> 01:22:06.788
SIMPLY PUT, IF SENECA WANTS TO

01:22:06.855 --> 01:22:08.890
GROW, WE HAVE TO FIRST STOP THE

01:22:08.957 --> 01:22:10.792
LOSS AND RETENTION IS THE NEW

01:22:10.859 --> 01:22:12.594
GROWTH AND MAKING SURE THAT WE

01:22:12.661 --> 01:22:14.596
HAVE WE'RE NOT ONLY HAVING A

01:22:14.663 --> 01:22:16.431
GOOD TRAINED WORKFORCE, BUT THAT

01:22:16.498 --> 01:22:16.998
WORKFORCE REMAINS AND STAYS

01:22:17.065 --> 01:22:18.533
WITHIN A REGION. WE'VE HEARD

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.669
FROM CSU SAN MARCOS THAT MANY OF

01:22:20.735 --> 01:22:22.404
THEIR STUDENTS WANT TO STAY

01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:22.937
HERE. YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY

01:22:23.004 --> 01:22:24.706
AFFORDABILITY AND HOUSING COST

01:22:24.773 --> 01:22:26.675
OF LIVING IS SO EXPENSIVE, AND

01:22:26.741 --> 01:22:28.576
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

01:22:28.643 --> 01:22:30.412
ABLE TO KEEP THEM HERE. AND PART

01:22:30.478 --> 01:22:32.681
OF THAT IS THE TALENT AND THE

01:22:32.747 --> 01:22:34.416
WORKFORCE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO

01:22:34.482 --> 01:22:34.949
HOPEFULLY KEEP HERE IN OUR

01:22:35.016 --> 01:22:35.550
REGION, ESPECIALLY WITH OUR

01:22:35.617 --> 01:22:36.618
WORLD CLASS EDUCATION SYSTEM

01:22:36.685 --> 01:22:40.555
THAT WE HAVE HERE. AND SOME OF

01:22:40.622 --> 01:22:42.524
THE STATEWIDE SOLUTIONS I THINK,

01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:43.191
THAT WE COULD EXPLORE IN LOOKING

01:22:43.258 --> 01:22:44.859
AT CALIFORNIA COMPETES TAX

01:22:44.926 --> 01:22:46.695
CREDIT AND SMALL BUSINESS

01:22:46.761 --> 01:22:48.430
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

01:22:48.496 --> 01:22:50.532
HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE, BUT THE

01:22:50.598 --> 01:22:51.199
REACH REMAINS UNEVEN, ESPECIALLY

01:22:51.266 --> 01:22:52.901
FOR MICRO BUSINESSES, IMMIGRANT

01:22:52.967 --> 01:22:54.803
OWNED FIRMS AND UNINCORPORATED

01:22:54.869 --> 01:22:56.705
AREAS OF THE COUNTY. HOWEVER,

01:22:56.771 --> 01:22:57.238
WITH THE RECENT COMMITTEE

01:22:57.305 --> 01:23:00.475
AMENDMENTS EARLIER THIS WEEK

01:23:00.542 --> 01:23:01.009
WHICH INCREASED OUTREACH

01:23:01.076 --> 01:23:02.811
CAPACITY FOR TAP, WE'RE HOPEFUL

01:23:02.877 --> 01:23:04.813
THAT THIS POSITIVITY AFFECTS THE

01:23:04.879 --> 01:23:06.748
OUTREACH EFFICACY OF THAT

01:23:06.815 --> 01:23:10.518
PROGRAM. ONE EXAMPLE THAT IS

01:23:10.585 --> 01:23:11.119
WORKING IS LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS

01:23:11.186 --> 01:23:14.522
LIKE PROCUREMENT PROCUREMENT

01:23:14.589 --> 01:23:15.056
ACCELERATOR, WHICH HELPED

01:23:15.123 --> 01:23:16.758
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF ASIAN AND

01:23:16.825 --> 01:23:18.526
LATINO OWNED BUSINESSES

01:23:18.593 --> 01:23:19.160
CERTIFIED TO CONTRACT WITH THE

01:23:19.227 --> 01:23:20.862
GOVERNMENT. BUT THOSE PROGRAMS

01:23:20.929 --> 01:23:22.530
ARE LIMITED IN SCALE AND

01:23:22.597 --> 01:23:24.532
FUNDING. CONVERSELY, BUSINESS

01:23:24.599 --> 01:23:25.200
OWNERS THAT TELL US NAVIGATING

01:23:25.266 --> 01:23:27.001
STATE AND LOCAL RELIEF PROGRAMS

01:23:27.068 --> 01:23:28.837
IS OFTEN A LITTLE TOO COMPLEX, A

01:23:28.903 --> 01:23:30.605
LITTLE SLOW, AND TOO

01:23:30.672 --> 01:23:31.206
DISCONNECTED FROM THE ACTUAL

01:23:31.272 --> 01:23:32.774
NEED, WHICH IS, I BELIEVE, FOR

01:23:32.841 --> 01:23:34.609
US TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE WITH OUR

01:23:34.676 --> 01:23:36.644
LOCAL OPERATORS IS SUPER

01:23:36.711 --> 01:23:37.278
HELPFUL. SO WITH THAT, I ONLY

01:23:37.345 --> 01:23:38.813
HAVE THREE SPECIFIC

01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:39.347
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THIS

01:23:39.414 --> 01:23:40.949
COMMITTEE COULD WE COULD PARTNER

01:23:41.015 --> 01:23:42.784
WITH YOU ON, THE FIRST OF WHICH

01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:43.318
IS STREAMLINE AND EXPAND

01:24:24.859 --> 01:24:26.594

A ONE SIZE FITS ALL STATEWIDE

01:24:28.663 --> 01:24:30.732
FORMULA. A REGIONAL COLA WOULD

01:24:30.799 --> 01:24:31.366
BETTER SUPPORT WORKING FAMILIES

JUST ABOVE THE FEDERAL POVERTY

01:24:34.602 --> 01:24:36.704

LEADERSHIP TO UNDERSTANDING OUR

01:25:01.095 --> 01:25:02.797
REGION AND OUR ECONOMIC TERRAIN.

01:25:02.864 --> 01:25:04.666
THIS IS A MOMENT THAT DEMANDS

01:25:04.732 --> 01:25:05.300
BOLD, CREATIVE SOLUTIONS WHICH I

01:25:05.366 --> 01:25:07.035
KNOW YOU'RE PROVIDING TO US. SO

01:25:07.101 --> 01:25:09.003
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT. NOT

01:25:09.070 --> 01:25:10.805
JUST TO HELP FAMILIES SURVIVE,

01:25:10.872 --> 01:25:11.473
BUT TO HELP OUR COMMUNITIES STAY

01:25:11.539 --> 01:25:13.074
AND THRIVE. THANKS FOR YOUR

01:25:13.141 --> 01:25:14.843
TIME. THANK YOU FOR THAT INPUT.

01:25:14.909 --> 01:25:17.045
I LOVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET

01:25:17.111 --> 01:25:19.013
INPUT ON ANY BILLS OR THINGS

01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:20.815
THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING IN

01:25:20.882 --> 01:25:22.650
SACRAMENTO, SO I APPRECIATE THAT

01:25:22.717 --> 01:25:24.652
SPECIFIC FEEDBACK. YEAH, WE

01:25:24.719 --> 01:25:25.286
DEFINITELY HAVE BILLS THAT ARE

01:25:25.353 --> 01:25:26.888
OBVIOUSLY HOPEFULLY GOING TO

01:25:26.955 --> 01:25:28.656
MAKE SOME REAL IMPACT IN

01:25:28.723 --> 01:25:30.959
CALIFORNIANS. BUT WITH THAT, I

01:25:31.025 --> 01:25:32.760
WAS ACTUALLY INTRIGUED BY WHAT.

01:25:32.827 --> 01:25:34.662
AND I'LL JUST DIVE INTO A QUICK

01:25:34.729 --> 01:25:35.230
QUESTION. YOU MENTIONED THE

01:25:35.296 --> 01:25:36.998
ZONES. CAN YOU ELABORATE MORE ON

01:25:37.065 --> 01:25:38.766
THAT? BECAUSE I WAS I WAS MORE

01:25:38.833 --> 01:25:40.668
INTRIGUED BY THAT PART OF THE OF

01:25:40.735 --> 01:25:41.336
YOUR. YEAH, WE SAW SOME OF THIS,

01:25:41.402 --> 01:25:42.904
PARTICULARLY THROUGHOUT THE

01:25:42.971 --> 01:25:44.639
PANDEMIC, WHERE, YOU KNOW, AS WE

01:25:44.706 --> 01:25:45.306
SEE A LOT OF THE FEDERAL FUNDING

01:25:45.373 --> 01:25:47.075
FOR BLOCK GRANTS GOING AWAY,

01:25:47.141 --> 01:25:48.743
WHETHER THEY'RE PROMISE ZONES OR

01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:49.344
FOLKS HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO

01:25:49.410 --> 01:25:50.979
UTILIZE THE OPPORTUNITY ZONES,

01:25:51.045 --> 01:25:52.780
WE HAVE 52 IN THE SAN DIEGO

01:25:52.847 --> 01:25:54.749
REGION BEING ABLE TO HAVE MORE

01:25:54.816 --> 01:25:56.885
SPECIFIC, I THINK, AREAS WHERE

01:25:56.951 --> 01:25:58.887
WE'RE LOOKING AT MAYBE WHAT'S

01:25:58.953 --> 01:26:00.755
DESIGNATING FOR INCENTIVES OR

01:26:00.822 --> 01:26:01.356
WHERE WE'RE HELPING A LOT OF

01:26:01.422 --> 01:26:03.124
SMALL BUSINESSES. WE SAW THAT IN

01:26:03.191 --> 01:26:05.159
THE PAN ASIAN CULTURAL DISTRICT.

01:26:05.226 --> 01:26:06.895
WHILE IT'S NOT A DESIGNATED

01:26:06.961 --> 01:26:09.130
ZONE, PARTICULARLY AS A PROMISE

01:26:09.197 --> 01:26:10.899
ZONE, THERE WAS A LOT OF HIGH

01:26:10.965 --> 01:26:12.667
CULTURAL AND LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE

01:26:12.734 --> 01:26:14.669
NEEDS IN THAT REGION. BUT

01:26:14.736 --> 01:26:15.136
BECAUSE THERE WERE NO

01:26:15.203 --> 01:26:16.905
RESIDENCIES BASED ON THE CENSUS,

01:26:16.971 --> 01:26:18.673
IT MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO

01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:19.240
CREATE CERTAIN POLICIES. SO

01:26:19.307 --> 01:26:21.175
LOCAL FUNDING, WHETHER IT WAS A

01:26:21.242 --> 01:26:23.011
CARES ACT OR ARPA, WE WERE ABLE

01:26:23.077 --> 01:26:24.879
TO GET WITH THE LOCAL

01:26:24.946 --> 01:26:25.513
POLICYMAKERS TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:27.215
WE COULD HAVE THOSE LANGUAGE BE

01:26:27.282 --> 01:26:29.050
A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBLE IN

01:26:29.117 --> 01:26:30.818
TERMS OF HOW WE WERE ABLE TO

01:26:30.885 --> 01:26:31.486
ACTION INCENTIVES OR SUPPORT FOR

01:26:31.553 --> 01:26:33.087
THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES. SO I

01:26:33.154 --> 01:26:34.722
THINK JUST OPENING UP THE

01:26:34.789 --> 01:26:36.724
TOOLBOX A LOT MORE TO MAKE SURE

01:26:36.791 --> 01:26:37.358
THAT WE HAVE CERTAIN POLICIES

01:26:37.425 --> 01:26:39.127
THAT ARE A LITTLE LESS GENERAL

01:26:39.193 --> 01:26:40.695
AND A LOT MORE PRESCRIPTIVE

01:26:40.762 --> 01:26:41.329
TOWARDS CERTAIN REGIONS AND ZIP

01:26:41.396 --> 01:26:43.164
CODES THAT COULD HELP US. BUT IT

01:26:43.231 --> 01:26:44.866
ALSO REQUIRES A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:26:44.933 --> 01:26:46.668
DATA, WHICH OBVIOUSLY WE'LL DO

01:26:46.734 --> 01:26:47.235
WHAT WE CAN TO HELP SUPPORT

01:26:47.302 --> 01:26:49.070
THAT. AND I KNOW SENATOR PATEL

01:26:49.137 --> 01:26:50.805
HAS DONE QUITE A BIT TO MAKE

01:26:50.872 --> 01:26:52.774
SURE THAT WE HAVE A MORE

01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:53.441
COMPLETE DATA TO MAKE SURE WE'RE

01:26:53.508 --> 01:26:55.043
ADDRESSING A LOT OF THOSE NEEDS.

01:26:55.109 --> 01:26:56.878
CHAIRMAN. GOT IT. THANK YOU FOR

01:26:56.945 --> 01:26:58.680
THAT. AND THAT KIND OF LEADS

01:26:58.746 --> 01:26:59.380
INTO MY ONE OF MY QUESTIONS THAT

01:26:59.447 --> 01:27:01.182
I HAD, WHICH IS, YOU KNOW, AS

01:27:01.249 --> 01:27:02.951
YOUR LOCAL EXPERIENCE IN

01:27:03.017 --> 01:27:03.551
BUSINESS AND THE WORK YOU'RE

01:27:03.618 --> 01:27:06.821
DOING, WHAT POLICY CHANGES

01:27:06.888 --> 01:27:08.890
POSSIBLY OR SUPPORT MECHANISMS

01:27:08.957 --> 01:27:11.092
COULD BE THAT WE COULD POSSIBLY

01:27:11.159 --> 01:27:13.027
LOOK AT IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE

01:27:13.094 --> 01:27:14.862
THAT COULD HELP, YOU KNOW, WITH

01:27:14.929 --> 01:27:16.998
THE SAN DIEGO LOCAL ECONOMY

01:27:17.065 --> 01:27:18.866
THRIVE MORE. SO IS THERE

01:27:18.933 --> 01:27:19.400
SOMETHING THAT, YOU KNOW,

01:27:19.467 --> 01:27:20.902
OBVIOUSLY, WE HEARD IN THE LAST

01:27:20.969 --> 01:27:22.937
PANEL, THE PERMITTING PROCESS,

01:27:23.004 --> 01:27:23.438
RIGHT, IN THE STATE OF

01:27:23.504 --> 01:27:24.939
CALIFORNIA, BUT ARE THERE ANY

01:27:25.006 --> 01:27:26.774
POLICY CHANGES OR SUPPORT

01:27:26.841 --> 01:27:28.676
MECHANISMS THAT WE COULD HELP

01:27:28.743 --> 01:27:29.243
ADDRESS AT THE STATE THAT WE

01:27:29.310 --> 01:27:31.212
LOOK TO LEGISLATION OR THROUGH,

01:27:31.279 --> 01:27:33.147
OBVIOUSLY, FUNDING? I KNOW THAT

01:27:33.214 --> 01:27:34.916
FUNDING IS ALWAYS AN EASY ONE TO

01:27:34.983 --> 01:27:36.784
DO BECAUSE IT'S JUST GIVE US

01:27:36.851 --> 01:27:37.285
MORE MONEY AND WE'LL DO

01:27:37.352 --> 01:27:38.920
SOMETHING. BUT ARE THERE ANY ANY

01:27:38.987 --> 01:27:40.822
ACTUAL POLICIES THAT YOU SEE

01:27:40.888 --> 01:27:41.356
THAT WE COULD ADDRESS AS

01:27:41.422 --> 01:27:43.057
LEGISLATORS? AND SO WE WOULD

01:27:43.124 --> 01:27:45.093
LIKE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING

01:27:45.159 --> 01:27:46.861
THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO GIVE US

01:27:46.928 --> 01:27:48.896
ANY FEEDBACK ON THAT. I'VE

01:27:48.963 --> 01:27:51.165
ALREADY MENTIONED THE FUNDING

01:27:51.232 --> 01:27:53.201
PIECE, BUT SPECIFICALLY THERE

01:27:53.267 --> 01:27:55.203
ARE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE

01:27:55.269 --> 01:27:57.105
ALREADY DOING THE HARD WORK.

01:27:57.171 --> 01:27:58.873
RIGHT? AND SO IT'S NOT ABOUT

01:27:58.940 --> 01:27:59.507
JUST THROWING MONEY AT IT, BUT

01:27:59.574 --> 01:28:01.275
IT'S ALSO JUST DISTRIBUTING THE

01:28:01.342 --> 01:28:02.944
FUNDING TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:28:03.011 --> 01:28:04.879
ALREADY ON THE GROUND. SO

01:28:04.946 --> 01:28:06.781
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE WE BOTH

01:28:06.848 --> 01:28:07.448
MENTIONED SBDC AND SPECIFICALLY

01:28:07.515 --> 01:28:09.217
I SIT ON THE BOARD OF A

01:28:09.283 --> 01:28:12.887
FOUNDATION WHO SPECIFICALLY IS

01:28:12.954 --> 01:28:15.156
PUTTING EDUCATION SURROUNDING

01:28:15.223 --> 01:28:17.158
WOMEN FOUNDERS AND WOMEN

01:28:17.225 --> 01:28:20.828
INVESTORS AND, AND SORT OF

01:28:20.895 --> 01:28:23.064
CREATING THAT COMMUNITY. THE

01:28:23.131 --> 01:28:25.199
OTHER THING, TOO, IS I HAVE TO

01:28:25.266 --> 01:28:28.836
GIVE A THANKS TO CAL STATE SAN

01:28:28.903 --> 01:28:29.504
MARCOS, WHO'S ACTUALLY THERE WAS

01:28:29.570 --> 01:28:33.041
A GRANT LAST YEAR THAT HELPED ME

01:28:33.107 --> 01:28:34.942
BRING IN TWO INTERNS, WHICH I

01:28:35.009 --> 01:28:37.278
THEN WERE SO AMAZING. I KEPT

01:28:37.345 --> 01:28:39.280
THEM ON AS PART TIME. AND THEN

01:28:39.347 --> 01:28:41.249
NOW ONE OF THEM IS FULL TIME.

01:28:41.315 --> 01:28:43.117
AND SO THESE TYPES OF, YOU KNOW,

01:28:43.184 --> 01:28:46.788
I THINK IT WAS THE CITY OF SAN

01:28:46.854 --> 01:28:47.321
DIEGO, PLUS CAL STATE SAN

01:28:47.388 --> 01:28:49.257
MARCOS. AND THEY CAME IN AT NO

01:28:49.323 --> 01:28:51.025
COST TO ME, YOU KNOW, THE

01:28:51.092 --> 01:28:53.194
BUSINESS OWNER TO BRING IN THESE

01:28:53.261 --> 01:28:54.996
AMAZING FOLKS. AND EVENTUALLY,

01:28:55.063 --> 01:28:55.663
BECAUSE THEY WERE SO AMAZING, I

01:28:55.730 --> 01:28:57.265
DID NOT WANT TO LOSE THEM.

01:28:57.331 --> 01:28:59.067
RIGHT. AND SO THEN JOBS WERE

01:28:59.133 --> 01:29:00.902
CREATED. SO THESE TYPES OF

01:29:00.968 --> 01:29:02.970
FUNDING AVENUES, AGAIN, IT'S NOT

01:29:03.037 --> 01:29:04.972
THROWING MONEY, BUT IT'S LIKE

01:29:05.039 --> 01:29:06.808
THESE AVENUES THAT ARE ALREADY

01:29:06.874 --> 01:29:08.876
ESTABLISHED BUT ARE REALLY

01:29:08.943 --> 01:29:09.444
HELPING THE FOLKS DOING THE

01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:11.379
WORK. GREAT. THANK YOU FOR THAT.

01:29:11.446 --> 01:29:13.281
I'LL ASK THE NEXT QUESTION, BUT

01:29:13.347 --> 01:29:15.216
I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT ALSO

01:29:15.283 --> 01:29:16.884
INTERNSHIPS, RIGHT? WE HAVE

01:29:16.951 --> 01:29:18.953
STUDENTS HERE. I HAVE I THINK I

01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:20.988
HAVE MY INTERN IN MY OFFICE IN

01:29:21.055 --> 01:29:22.890
THE LAST SIX MONTHS. WE ALL AS

01:29:22.957 --> 01:29:23.558
STUDENT LEADERS DID INTERNSHIPS.

01:29:23.624 --> 01:29:25.293
SO I WANT TO ECHO THAT TO ANYONE

01:29:25.359 --> 01:29:27.295
IN THE AUDIENCE AND WATCHING

01:29:27.361 --> 01:29:28.963
THAT GIVE OUR YOUTH THE

01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:30.798
OPPORTUNITY TO INTERN, LET THEM

01:29:30.865 --> 01:29:31.432
EXPLORE THE WORK THAT YOU'RE

01:29:31.499 --> 01:29:33.234
DOING EVERY DAY. AND IT JUST

01:29:33.301 --> 01:29:35.103
HELPS US JUST EXPAND OUR

01:29:35.169 --> 01:29:36.938
HORIZONS. I ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE I

01:29:37.004 --> 01:29:37.605
LOVE MY LOCAL COMMUNITY, BUT GO

01:29:37.672 --> 01:29:39.340
LIVE A LITTLE, GO, GO LEARN A

01:29:39.407 --> 01:29:41.142
LITTLE MORE ELSEWHERE, RIGHT?

01:29:41.209 --> 01:29:42.910
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO EXPLORE AND

01:29:42.977 --> 01:29:43.544
WHAT'S OUT THERE. I REMEMBER AS

01:29:43.611 --> 01:29:47.014
A YOUNG GOING TO WESTWOOD, RIGHT

01:29:47.081 --> 01:29:49.050
TO THE WEST SIDE, I LIVE IN THE

01:29:49.117 --> 01:29:50.918
SOUTHEAST PART OF LOS ANGELES. I

01:29:50.985 --> 01:29:51.452
WAS LIKE, WOW, THESE ARE

01:29:51.519 --> 01:29:53.020
BEAUTIFUL HOMES. THESE ARE

01:29:53.087 --> 01:29:53.621
BEAUTIFUL. PEOPLE HAVE NICE

01:29:53.688 --> 01:29:55.223
CARS, RIGHT? BUT IT JUST EXPANDS

01:29:55.289 --> 01:29:57.058
YOUR HORIZON OF WHAT YOU CAN. SO

01:29:57.125 --> 01:29:58.926
IT'S ALMOST LIKE THAT PART OF

01:29:58.993 --> 01:29:59.460
DREAMING AND WHAT CAN BE

01:29:59.527 --> 01:30:01.062
POSSIBLE, YOU KNOW, IN YOUR

01:30:01.129 --> 01:30:02.930
STORY IS GREAT TOO. AND YOUR,

01:30:02.997 --> 01:30:03.531
YOUR YOUR STORY. SO WITH THAT

01:30:03.598 --> 01:30:05.266
DOCTOR PATEL. YES. THANK YOU ALL

01:30:05.333 --> 01:30:06.934
FOR PRESENTING YOUR EXPERIENCES,

01:30:07.001 --> 01:30:09.203
ESPECIALLY FOR THE TWO BUSINESS

01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:10.938
ENTREPRENEURS. DOCTOR CHEN, I

01:30:11.005 --> 01:30:11.405
HAVE TO SAY, WHAT YOU

01:30:11.472 --> 01:30:13.274
EXPERIENCED IS SIMILAR TO WHAT

01:30:13.341 --> 01:30:15.009
WE EXPERIENCED IN SO MANY

01:30:15.076 --> 01:30:15.643
DIFFERENT SECTORS. I HEARD THE

01:30:15.710 --> 01:30:17.245
SAME THINGS WHEN I DECIDED TO

01:30:17.311 --> 01:30:19.413
PUT MY HAT IN THE RING TO RUN

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:21.382
FOR THIS STATE LEVEL OFFICE.

01:30:21.449 --> 01:30:23.117
PEOPLE ASK ME, WELL, WHO'S GOING

01:30:23.184 --> 01:30:24.952
TO MANAGE YOUR HOUSEHOLD? AND

01:30:25.019 --> 01:30:25.486
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE THESE

01:30:25.553 --> 01:30:27.054
CONVERSATIONS. BUT THE REALITY

01:30:27.121 --> 01:30:28.956
IS, AS I SAID BEFORE, WHEN YOU

01:30:29.023 --> 01:30:30.992
BRING DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES TO

01:30:31.058 --> 01:30:31.559
THE TABLE, YOU'RE ABLE TO

01:30:31.626 --> 01:30:33.327
INNOVATE IN NEW SPACES AND IN

01:30:33.394 --> 01:30:35.363
NEW WAYS AND REALLY UNLOCK

01:30:35.429 --> 01:30:37.331
ECONOMIC POTENTIAL THAT MIGHT

01:30:37.398 --> 01:30:39.133
NOT HAVE BEEN THERE BEFORE. AND

01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:41.369
FOR MR. PAGUIO, I WANT TO ASK

01:30:41.435 --> 01:30:45.006
AGAIN AND REITERATE, THERE IS

01:30:45.072 --> 01:30:47.108
ABSOLUTELY A NEED TO DO TARGETED

01:30:47.175 --> 01:30:49.076
INTERVENTIONS AND MAKE SURE THAT

01:30:49.143 --> 01:30:50.912
WE ARE ABLE TO UNLOCK THE

01:30:50.978 --> 01:30:51.512
POTENTIAL OF OUR ECONOMY. WHEN

01:30:51.579 --> 01:30:53.347
WE LOOK AT CERTAIN SECTORS,

01:30:53.414 --> 01:30:55.183
THERE ARE PEOPLE HUNGRY TO PUT

01:30:55.249 --> 01:30:57.385
THEIR INNOVATIONS, THEIR IDEAS,

01:30:57.451 --> 01:30:59.287
THEIR THEIR SOLUTIONS OUT THERE.

01:30:59.353 --> 01:31:01.255
THEY JUST DON'T KNOW HOW. AND

01:31:01.322 --> 01:31:03.157
THEY MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS, EVEN

01:31:03.224 --> 01:31:05.226
CULTURALLY OR ECONOMICALLY OR

01:31:05.293 --> 01:31:07.295
REGIONALLY TO THE SERVICES AND

01:31:07.361 --> 01:31:09.063
SUPPORTS THAT THEY NEED. AND THE

01:31:09.130 --> 01:31:10.932
WORK THAT THE SBDC DOES IS

01:31:10.998 --> 01:31:12.967
INVALUABLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. I

01:31:13.034 --> 01:31:14.936
CAN'T SHARE ENOUGH HOW, WHEN WE

01:31:15.002 --> 01:31:15.603
LOOK AT STARTING A BUSINESS. MY

01:31:15.670 --> 01:31:17.305
FATHER WAS A CIVIL ENGINEER, BUT

01:31:17.371 --> 01:31:19.173
ULTIMATELY HE MADE HIS SUCCESS

01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:21.008
IN A SMALL BUSINESS. AND

01:31:21.075 --> 01:31:23.044
SOMETIMES IT'S IMPORTANT TO DO

01:31:23.110 --> 01:31:24.946
THAT FOR YOUR OWN FAMILY, BUT

01:31:25.012 --> 01:31:27.215
ALSO FOR SOCIETY. SO THERE'S A

01:31:27.281 --> 01:31:29.283
BIG PUSH IN THIS REGION AROUND

01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:33.020
EQUITY AND OPPORTUNITY, FROM

01:31:33.087 --> 01:31:35.022
PROCUREMENT TO MULTILINGUAL

01:31:35.089 --> 01:31:35.590
OUTREACH. WHAT DO YOU THINK

01:31:35.656 --> 01:31:37.225
OTHER CITIES OR REGIONS ARE

01:31:37.291 --> 01:31:39.193
DOING THAT COULD INFORM HOW WE

01:31:39.260 --> 01:31:43.030
COULD DO IT BETTER? MAYBE IT'S

01:31:43.097 --> 01:31:43.698
NOT JUST HERE IN CALIFORNIA, BUT

01:31:43.764 --> 01:31:45.333
MAYBE IT'S IN OTHER PARTS OF THE

01:31:45.399 --> 01:31:47.468
UNITED STATES OR GLOBALLY. HAVE

01:31:47.535 --> 01:31:51.038
YOU SEEN ANY POLICY OR MAYBE NOT

01:31:51.105 --> 01:31:53.040
POLICY IDEAS, JUST INCENTIVE

01:31:53.107 --> 01:31:55.042
IDEAS THAT ARE WORKING THAT WE

01:31:55.109 --> 01:31:56.944
COULD ADOPT HERE IN CALIFORNIA

01:31:57.011 --> 01:31:59.313
FOR OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. I

01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:03.050
HAVE ONE ON THAT. PATEL. SIMILAR

01:32:03.117 --> 01:32:05.253
TO AB 2019, THE EQUITY AND

01:32:05.319 --> 01:32:07.255
PROCUREMENT BILL. SEEING THE

01:32:07.321 --> 01:32:09.056
WATERFALL FROM THAT, WE HAD

01:32:09.123 --> 01:32:11.225
RECENTLY, SUPERVISOR MONTGOMERY

01:32:11.292 --> 01:32:13.394
STEP ADOPT A POLICY FOR EQUITY

01:32:13.461 --> 01:32:15.162
AND PROCUREMENT IN THE REGION,

01:32:15.229 --> 01:32:17.365
MIMICKING THE 25% PROCUREMENT

01:32:17.431 --> 01:32:19.033
GOALS FOR THE STATE, WHICH THE

01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:19.600
CITY HAS EXCEEDED ALL THEIR

01:32:19.667 --> 01:32:21.335
GOALS SINCE THE IMPLEMENTATION

01:32:21.402 --> 01:32:21.936
OF THAT BILL AND WORKING WITH

01:32:22.003 --> 01:32:23.404
THEIR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

01:32:23.471 --> 01:32:25.172
PROVIDERS. AS YOU ALLUDED TO, WE

01:32:25.239 --> 01:32:25.840
HAVE OVER 100 BUSINESS ADVISORS

01:32:25.907 --> 01:32:29.076
WITHIN THE SBDC NETWORK AND OF

01:32:29.143 --> 01:32:29.710
THOSE SPECIALTIES AND EVERYBODY

01:32:29.777 --> 01:32:31.212
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. THOSE ARE

01:32:31.279 --> 01:32:33.080
PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE COMMUNITY

01:32:33.147 --> 01:32:33.714
EVERY SINGLE DAY, WORKING WITH

01:32:33.781 --> 01:32:35.216
THEIR BUSINESSES TO MAKE SURE

01:32:35.283 --> 01:32:37.151
THEY COULD DO ALL THAT WORK. AND

01:32:37.218 --> 01:32:37.718
AS ECONOMY AND WE'RE DEALING

01:32:37.785 --> 01:32:39.120
WITH THE TARIFFS AND A LOT OF

01:32:39.186 --> 01:32:41.155
UNCERTAINTY AND POLICIES THAT

01:32:41.222 --> 01:32:43.057
ARE MAYBE UNFAMILIAR TO A LOT OF

01:32:43.124 --> 01:32:43.691
FOLKS, THE PLACE WE COULD TURN

01:32:43.758 --> 01:32:45.526
TO, WE BELIEVE IS REALLY LOCAL

01:32:45.593 --> 01:32:46.127
GOVERNMENT. BUT SOME OF THAT

01:32:46.193 --> 01:32:47.228
COMES FROM LEADERSHIP, FROM THE

01:32:47.295 --> 01:32:49.397
STATE. SO OUR ABILITY TO WORK

01:32:49.463 --> 01:32:51.265
WITH THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS

01:32:51.332 --> 01:32:51.866
AND THE COUNTY AND THEIR FEW

01:32:51.933 --> 01:32:53.334
BILLION DOLLARS IN SPEND IN OUR

01:32:53.401 --> 01:32:55.269
COMMUNITY HAVING TO MIMIC A

01:32:55.336 --> 01:32:57.305
BILL, BUT HAVING THE MECHANISMS

01:32:57.371 --> 01:32:59.040
IN PLACE FOR OUTREACH, BUT BE

01:32:59.106 --> 01:32:59.640
ABLE TO PROVIDE THE TECHNICAL

01:32:59.707 --> 01:33:01.375
ASSISTANCE AND BUYING POWER, I

01:33:01.442 --> 01:33:03.311
THINK BEING ABLE TO MIMIC SOME

01:33:03.377 --> 01:33:05.146
OF THOSE BILLS AND IMPLEMENT

01:33:05.212 --> 01:33:05.713
THEM IN OUR LOCAL REGIONS,

01:33:05.780 --> 01:33:07.315
WHETHER IT'S THE COUNTY OR LOCAL

01:33:07.381 --> 01:33:09.350
MUNICIPALITIES, I THINK COULD

01:33:09.417 --> 01:33:11.185
GIVE US THAT OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE

01:33:11.252 --> 01:33:13.120
SURE THAT MONEY STAYS WITHIN OUR

01:33:13.187 --> 01:33:13.788
LOCAL COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU FOR

01:33:13.854 --> 01:33:17.291
THAT. I THINK WE OH, I'VE GOT

01:33:17.358 --> 01:33:19.060
TIME TO ASK ONE MORE QUESTION,

01:33:19.126 --> 01:33:21.362
MR. DAVISON. WHEN WE WHEN YOU

01:33:21.429 --> 01:33:23.064
WERE GOING THROUGH ALL OF YOUR

01:33:23.130 --> 01:33:25.132
CHALLENGES OF FINDING OUT HOW TO

01:33:25.199 --> 01:33:25.733
MANUFACTURE, YOU PIVOTED OVER

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:27.468
AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO MAKE

01:33:27.535 --> 01:33:29.437
SURE YOU COULD BRING THIS

01:33:29.503 --> 01:33:31.072
WONDERFUL PRODUCT TO MARKET? I'M

01:33:31.138 --> 01:33:31.706
JUST IMPRESSED AT THE TENACITY

01:33:31.772 --> 01:33:35.142
THAT YOUR BUSINESS IS ABLE TO

01:33:35.209 --> 01:33:35.810
EXPERIENCE IN ORDER TO REALLY DO

01:33:35.876 --> 01:33:37.411
THIS CUTTING EDGE WORK. WE ARE

01:33:37.478 --> 01:33:39.513
ALL LOOKING FOR WAYS TO MAKE OUR

01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:41.515
PLANET MORE LIVABLE, RIGHT? FOR

01:33:41.582 --> 01:33:45.386
THE LONG TERM. HOW HOW HAVE YOU

01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:47.388
LEVERAGED CREATIVE PARTNERSHIPS

01:33:47.455 --> 01:33:49.357
INTERNATIONALLY, AND HOW DO YOU

01:33:49.423 --> 01:33:51.158
HAVE ANY ADVICE FOR PEOPLE WHO

01:33:51.225 --> 01:33:53.160
ARE TRYING TO NAVIGATE THIS

01:33:53.227 --> 01:33:55.162
SPACE OF RISING COSTS OF

01:33:55.229 --> 01:33:57.264
IMPORTING GOODS, TARIFFS, ETC?

01:33:57.331 --> 01:33:59.233
DO YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE FOR

01:33:59.300 --> 01:33:59.800
PEOPLE OUT THERE NAVIGATING

01:33:59.867 --> 01:34:05.172
SIMILAR SPACES TO YOU? REACH OUT

01:34:05.239 --> 01:34:05.740
TO SBDC AND TALK TO BOBBY

01:34:05.806 --> 01:34:07.575
EDELMAN BECAUSE BOBBY HAS SOME

01:34:07.641 --> 01:34:09.377
AMAZING CONNECTIONS WORLDWIDE.

01:34:09.443 --> 01:34:11.579
WE'VE BEEN FORTUNATE AT LEAST TO

01:34:11.645 --> 01:34:13.180
HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE ON OUR BOARD

01:34:13.247 --> 01:34:17.184
TO CONNECT US WITH LOCAL PEOPLE.

01:34:17.251 --> 01:34:19.253
ACTUALLY THE BRINK. WE'VE ALSO

01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:21.188
HAD, YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW,

01:34:21.255 --> 01:34:21.822
CONNECTIONS TO MEXICO. I MEAN,

01:34:21.889 --> 01:34:23.591
IT'S ALL THESE RESOURCES HAVE

01:34:23.657 --> 01:34:25.493
ACTUALLY BEEN THROUGH THE LOCAL

01:34:25.559 --> 01:34:27.228
RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE HERE, AND

01:34:27.294 --> 01:34:29.263
THAT'S HOW WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO

01:34:29.330 --> 01:34:29.830
MAKE THESE CONTACTS AND HOW

01:34:29.897 --> 01:34:31.265
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO TALK WITH

01:34:31.332 --> 01:34:33.467
THEM. SO IF WE HAVE THESE

01:34:33.534 --> 01:34:35.569
RESOURCES DOWN HERE, PLEASE USE

01:34:35.636 --> 01:34:37.505
THEM AND WE HOPE WE CONTINUE

01:34:37.571 --> 01:34:39.340
HAVING THEM. I WILL JUST JUMP IN

01:34:39.407 --> 01:34:41.275
REAL QUICK AND TALK ABOUT

01:34:41.342 --> 01:34:43.177
FUNDING AGAIN, BECAUSE, YOU

01:34:43.244 --> 01:34:43.844
KNOW, WE GOT APPROVED FOR THAT,

01:34:43.911 --> 01:34:45.513
THAT CLIMATE TECH AWARD, WHICH

01:34:45.579 --> 01:34:49.183
IS 80% OF 5 MILLION. BUT IT

01:34:49.250 --> 01:34:49.784
TURNED OUT THAT AFTER SILICON

01:34:49.850 --> 01:34:51.385
VALLEY NATIONAL BANK FAILED, ALL

01:34:51.452 --> 01:34:53.487
THE BANKS KIND OF BACKED OFF ON

01:34:53.554 --> 01:34:54.055
THAT. SO THAT BACKING, WE

01:34:54.121 --> 01:34:55.556
COULDN'T ACTUALLY GET A LOAN

01:34:55.623 --> 01:34:57.691
BASED ON THAT UNLESS WE HAD, YOU

01:34:57.758 --> 01:34:59.460
KNOW, BASICALLY A STANDARD LOAN,

01:34:59.527 --> 01:35:01.362
ENOUGH EQUITY, ENOUGH REVENUE.

01:35:01.429 --> 01:35:01.929
AND OF COURSE, BEING AN R&amp;D

01:35:01.996 --> 01:35:03.364
FACILITY, YOU KNOW, WE DIDN'T

01:35:03.431 --> 01:35:05.499
HAVE THOSE THINGS. SO WE STILL

01:35:05.566 --> 01:35:06.100
HAVE THAT GUARANTEE, BUT WE

01:35:06.167 --> 01:35:07.468
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO USE IT WITH

01:35:07.535 --> 01:35:09.370
ANY BANK WITHOUT ENOUGH MOUS AND

01:35:09.437 --> 01:35:11.439
LOIS, WHICH WE ARE WORKING ON

01:35:11.505 --> 01:35:12.039
RIGHT NOW. BUT SO I'M JUST

01:35:12.106 --> 01:35:13.574
SAYING THAT IF THERE'S SOME WAY

01:35:13.641 --> 01:35:17.211
TO KIND OF UNLOCK THAT AND, AND

01:35:17.278 --> 01:35:19.447
STOP THAT KIND OF PARANOIA, THAT

01:35:19.513 --> 01:35:21.248
EVERYTHING KIND OF CLOSED DOWN

01:35:21.315 --> 01:35:23.284
AFTER SVB FAILED, THAT WOULD

01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:25.252
HELP A LOT OF ENTREPRENEURS A

01:35:25.319 --> 01:35:27.521
LOT. YEAH. SO IN SOME WAYS WE DO

01:35:27.588 --> 01:35:29.490
NEED SOME REGULATIONS AND

01:35:29.557 --> 01:35:31.192
OVERSIGHT, AND IN OTHER WAYS WE

01:35:31.258 --> 01:35:33.227
NEED TO LOOK AT BEING MORE

01:35:33.294 --> 01:35:33.828
STRATEGIC ABOUT WINDING DOWN

01:35:33.894 --> 01:35:35.563
SOME OR PROVIDING REGULATORY

01:35:35.629 --> 01:35:37.598
RELIEF. SO IT'S THAT IT'S THAT

01:35:37.665 --> 01:35:39.433
CONSTANT BALANCE. RIGHT? RIGHT.

01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:41.168
WE WANT TO BE STRATEGIC. THANK

01:35:41.235 --> 01:35:41.702
YOU FOR YOUR THOUGHTS AND

01:35:41.769 --> 01:35:43.537
INSIGHTS AND JUST SHARING HOW

01:35:43.604 --> 01:35:47.308
HELPFUL SBDC HAS BEEN. I HAVE

01:35:47.374 --> 01:35:47.975
NOT BEEN THAT FAMILIAR WITH IT.

01:35:48.042 --> 01:35:49.743
SO THIS HAS BEEN VERY INSIGHTFUL

01:35:49.810 --> 01:35:51.345
AND SUPPORTIVE FOR MY LEARNING

01:35:51.412 --> 01:35:53.180
AND I APPRECIATE YOU SHARING

01:35:53.247 --> 01:35:55.316
THOSE STORIES. THANK YOU. AND WE

01:35:55.382 --> 01:35:57.251
THANK THE PANELISTS FOR DOING A

01:35:57.318 --> 01:35:57.918
GREAT JOB. TODAY. WE'RE GOING TO

01:35:57.985 --> 01:35:59.253
GO INTO ONE MORE THING, WHICH IS

IT TOGETHER AND FIND A WAY TO

WHEN WE INVEST IN CHILDREN IN

THEIR PUBLIC EDUCATION, THEY

01:41:18.238 --> 01:41:19.573
COULD TURN AROUND AND GIVE BACK
