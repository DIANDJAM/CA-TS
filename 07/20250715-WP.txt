YOU FOR BEING HERE. WE'VE GOT I

00:45:11.341 --> 00:45:15.179
THINK SIX BILLS TODAY. AND GIVEN

00:45:15.245 --> 00:45:16.647
OUR SHORT AGENDA WE WON'T IMPOSE

00:45:16.713 --> 00:45:18.549
TIME LIMITS. BUT TRY TO BE AS

00:45:18.615 --> 00:45:19.716
BRIEF AS POSSIBLE AND NOT

00:45:19.783 --> 00:45:22.019
REPEATING OTHER POINTS AND

00:45:22.086 --> 00:45:23.487

00:45:30.861 --> 00:45:33.197
KNOW THAT WE DON'T HAVE A

00:45:33.263 --> 00:45:34.231
QUORUM, BUT THAT'S OKAY. WE'LL

00:45:34.298 --> 00:45:36.800
GET STARTED AS A SUBCOMMITTEE

00:45:36.867 --> 00:45:40.604
UNTIL WE DO SO. WITH THAT, I SEE

00:45:40.671 --> 00:45:42.206
THAT WE HAVE SENATOR HURTADO

00:45:42.272 --> 00:45:44.308

SB 224. AWESOME. BILL, I WANT TO

00:46:00.424 --> 00:46:01.358
START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE

00:46:01.425 --> 00:46:03.460
AND YOUR STAFF FOR YOUR WORK ON

00:46:03.527 --> 00:46:06.029
THIS MEASURE. I'M ACCEPTING THE

00:46:06.096 --> 00:46:07.464
AMENDMENTS, AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR

00:46:07.531 --> 00:46:08.699
THE THOUGHTFUL WORK THAT WENT

00:46:08.765 --> 00:46:11.301
INTO REFINING THIS MEASURE. THIS

00:46:11.368 --> 00:46:13.103
MEASURE REALLY BUILDS ON THE

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:15.105
GROUNDWORK LAID BY MY PREVIOUS

00:46:15.172 --> 00:46:19.576
BILL ON SB 231, WHICH I CARRIED

00:46:19.643 --> 00:46:22.579
IN 2023. SENATE BILL 2 TO 4

00:46:22.646 --> 00:46:24.348
REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER

00:46:24.414 --> 00:46:25.816
RESOURCES TO ADOPT THE

00:46:25.883 --> 00:46:27.151
OUTSTANDING RECOMMENDATIONS

00:46:27.217 --> 00:46:29.686
STEMMING FROM A 2023 AUDIT

00:46:29.753 --> 00:46:30.254
CONDUCTED BY THE INDEPENDENT

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:33.790
CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR, AND

00:46:33.857 --> 00:46:35.559
SPECIFICALLY, SB 224 WOULD

00:46:35.626 --> 00:46:37.661
REQUIRE DWR TO CONTINUE

00:46:37.728 --> 00:46:38.795
IMPLEMENTING ITS PLAN TO UPDATE

00:46:38.862 --> 00:46:40.531
WATER SUPPLY FORECASTING MODELS

00:46:40.597 --> 00:46:42.166
AND PROCEDURES THAT ADDRESS THE

00:46:42.232 --> 00:46:44.735
EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. IT

00:46:44.801 --> 00:46:47.871
WOULD ALSO ASK PROVIDE ANNUAL

00:46:47.938 --> 00:46:48.906
UPDATES TO THE LEGISLATURE

00:46:48.972 --> 00:46:51.375
RELATING DWR'S PROGRESS IN

00:46:51.441 --> 00:46:53.143
IMPLEMENTING THE NEW FORECASTING

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:56.413
MODEL, AND IT WOULD ALSO REQUEST

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:58.916
FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A

00:46:58.982 --> 00:47:00.417
FORMAL POLICY AND PROCEDURES FOR

00:47:00.484 --> 00:47:03.320
DOCUMENTING DWR OPERATIONAL

00:47:03.387 --> 00:47:04.655
PLANS FOR THE STATE'S WATER

00:47:04.721 --> 00:47:09.359
SUPPLY, SO THE WHOLE REASON FOR

00:47:09.426 --> 00:47:11.795
THIS BILL IS BACK IN WATER YEAR

00:47:11.862 --> 00:47:14.064
2021. THERE WAS A THE MODELING

00:47:14.131 --> 00:47:15.999
ERRORS BY DWR LED TO OVER

00:47:16.066 --> 00:47:17.968
RELEASE OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

00:47:18.035 --> 00:47:20.571
OF ACRE FEET OF WATER FROM THE

00:47:20.637 --> 00:47:23.340
RESERVOIR. AND YOU KNOW, THAT'S

00:47:23.407 --> 00:47:24.908
BILLIONS OF GALLONS OF WATER

00:47:24.975 --> 00:47:26.276
RELEASED TO THE SACRAMENTO-SAN

00:47:26.343 --> 00:47:27.611
JOAQUIN DELTA AT TIMES WHEN IT

00:47:27.678 --> 00:47:29.446
HAD NO POSITIVE IMPACT TO HUMANS

00:47:29.513 --> 00:47:32.349
OR WILDLIFE. SO, AGAIN, THIS IS

00:47:32.416 --> 00:47:35.219
REALLY A BILL THAT SEEKS TO

00:47:35.285 --> 00:47:38.088
STRENGTHEN OUR FORECASTING,

00:47:38.155 --> 00:47:41.058

HURTADO, AN IMPORTANT BILL WHICH

00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:18.662
WILL REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:48:24.635 --> 00:48:25.269
CONDUCTED BY THE INDEPENDENT

CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR. AS

00:48:27.938 --> 00:48:29.640
THIS COMMITTEE IS UNDOUBTEDLY

00:48:29.706 --> 00:48:30.707
AWARE, CALIFORNIA'S CENTRAL

00:48:30.774 --> 00:48:32.209
VALLEY PRODUCES MUCH OF THE

00:48:32.276 --> 00:48:34.645
NATION'S FOOD YET FACES SEVERE

00:48:34.711 --> 00:48:36.079
WATER SECURITY AND ALLOCATION

00:48:36.146 --> 00:48:39.249
CHALLENGES. THESE WATER SECURITY

00:48:39.316 --> 00:48:41.218
CHALLENGES ARE AMPLIFIED BY

00:48:41.285 --> 00:48:43.253
PERIODS OF SEVERE DROUGHT AND AS

00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:44.721
SENATOR SENATOR HURTADO

00:48:44.788 --> 00:48:46.156
MENTIONED DURING HER

00:48:46.223 --> 00:48:47.257
PRESENTATION, THE CITY OF

00:48:47.324 --> 00:48:48.692
COALINGA IS A PRIME EXAMPLE OF

00:48:48.759 --> 00:48:50.494
THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH POOR

00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:54.765
WATER MANAGEMENT. IN 2023, WATER

00:48:54.831 --> 00:48:55.799
RESTRICTIONS LEFT COALINGA SHORT

00:48:55.866 --> 00:48:58.302
OF 600 ACRE FEET OF WATER. THUS,

00:48:58.368 --> 00:48:59.903
THE CITY HAD TO RUN TO THE

00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:01.638
INCREASINGLY EXPENSIVE OPEN

00:49:01.705 --> 00:49:03.040
MARKET TO MAKE UP THE

00:49:03.106 --> 00:49:05.542
DIFFERENCE. THE CITY'S PRICE TAG

00:49:05.609 --> 00:49:07.010
FOR THE LIFE'S MOST BASIC

00:49:07.077 --> 00:49:09.579
NECESSITY WAS ROUGHLY $1.1

00:49:09.646 --> 00:49:10.914
MILLION, AND A CITY OFFICIAL

00:49:10.981 --> 00:49:12.482
TOLD CNN THE SAME AMOUNT OF

00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:15.252
WATER USED TO COST THE CITY

00:49:15.319 --> 00:49:19.990
114,000IN PREVIOUS YEARS.

00:49:20.057 --> 00:49:21.425
UNFORTUNATELY, MANY

00:49:21.491 --> 00:49:22.793
DISADVANTAGED AND LOW INCOME

00:49:22.859 --> 00:49:24.428
CENTRAL VALLEY COMMUNITIES ARE

00:49:24.494 --> 00:49:25.896
ALREADY STRUGGLING WITH WATER.

00:49:25.962 --> 00:49:27.631
SECURITY FACED INCREASED AND

00:49:27.698 --> 00:49:29.499
UNNECESSARY CHALLENGES DUE TO

00:49:29.566 --> 00:49:31.601
WATER MISCALCULATIONS. IN MY

00:49:31.668 --> 00:49:33.603
HOME COMMUNITY OF DELANO, WE

00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:35.472
HAVE FACED SEVERE WATER QUALITY

00:49:35.539 --> 00:49:37.674
ISSUES AND ACROSS THE STATE THE

00:49:37.741 --> 00:49:39.209
PROBLEM REMAINS SEVERE. MORE

00:49:39.276 --> 00:49:42.312
THAN 735,000 PEOPLE ARE STILL

00:49:42.379 --> 00:49:44.648
REVERED BY NEARLY 400 WATER

00:49:44.715 --> 00:49:47.084
SYSTEMS THAT FAIL TO MEET STATE

00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:48.485
REQUIREMENTS FOR SAFE AND

00:49:48.552 --> 00:49:50.287
RELIABLE DRINKING WATER.

00:49:50.354 --> 00:49:51.321
UNFORTUNATELY, THE MAJORITY OF

00:49:51.388 --> 00:49:53.156
THESE COMMUNITIES ARE LOCATED IN

00:49:53.223 --> 00:49:55.425
CALIFORNIA'S CENTRAL VALLEY,

00:49:55.492 --> 00:49:57.961
MANY OF WHOM ARE PRIMARILY

00:49:58.028 --> 00:50:00.497
LATINO FARM WORKING COMMUNITIES.

00:50:00.564 --> 00:50:01.798
SORRY, STRUGGLING WITH POVERTY

00:50:01.865 --> 00:50:04.401
AND HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT, WATER IS

00:50:04.468 --> 00:50:06.503
THE LIFEBLOOD FOR SO MANY OF OUR

00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:07.504
CENTRAL VALLEY COMMUNITIES, AND

00:50:07.571 --> 00:50:10.006
THIS IS WHY SB 224 IS VERY MUCH

00:50:10.073 --> 00:50:11.808
NEEDED TO STRENGTHEN

00:50:11.875 --> 00:50:12.776
CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO MANAGE

00:50:12.843 --> 00:50:15.479
ITS WATER RESOURCES, EFFECTIVELY

00:50:15.545 --> 00:50:17.280
ENHANCE THE STATE'S RESILIENCY

00:50:17.347 --> 00:50:19.483
TO DROUGHT. SO I TRULY THANK YOU

00:50:19.549 --> 00:50:21.318
FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY

00:50:21.385 --> 00:50:24.521
IN SUPPORT OF SB 224, AND I

GLASER. I'M THE EXECUTIVE

00:50:46.743 --> 00:50:49.179
DIRECTOR FOR THE DELTA WATER

00:50:49.246 --> 00:50:51.047
ASSOCIATION. I HAVE THE

00:50:51.114 --> 00:50:52.516
PRIVILEGE OF REPRESENTING

00:50:52.582 --> 00:50:54.551
FARMERS AND LANDOWNERS IN TULARE

00:50:54.618 --> 00:50:56.820

TRYING TO ADAPT TO THE

00:51:04.127 --> 00:51:05.128
SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER

00:51:05.195 --> 00:51:07.664
MANAGEMENT ACT AND THE

00:51:07.731 --> 00:51:08.632
IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT IN THE

00:51:08.698 --> 00:51:10.934
HEART OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY, SO

00:51:11.001 --> 00:51:13.537
IT REMAINS A TOP PRIORITY FOR

00:51:13.603 --> 00:51:15.005
US, FOR OUR GROUP AND OUR

00:51:15.071 --> 00:51:19.309
GROWERS. TO SEE THAT OUR STATE

00:51:19.376 --> 00:51:21.278
HAS THE ABILITY TO MANAGE THE

00:51:21.344 --> 00:51:22.012
WATER RESOURCES AS EFFICIENTLY

00:51:22.078 --> 00:51:24.481
AS POSSIBLE. I ALSO HAVE MEMBERS

00:51:24.548 --> 00:51:27.484

LANDOWNERS IN THESE COMMUNITIES.

00:51:29.386 --> 00:51:30.420
SO THE OBJECTIVES THAT ARE

00:51:30.487 --> 00:51:32.456
OUTLINED IN SB 24 WILL GIVE

00:51:32.522 --> 00:51:33.623

00:51:33.690 --> 00:51:35.392
OVERALL WATER MANAGEMENT

00:51:35.459 --> 00:51:37.127
PRACTICES. THE BILL COULD

00:51:37.194 --> 00:51:38.762
PREVENT UNNECESSARY WATER LOSS,

00:51:38.829 --> 00:51:40.730
WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY A HUGE

00:51:40.797 --> 00:51:41.865
COMPONENT AND ENHANCES THE

00:51:41.932 --> 00:51:43.667
STATE'S PREPAREDNESS IN OUR

00:51:43.733 --> 00:51:46.536
INEVITABLE DROUGHT YEARS. SO

00:51:46.603 --> 00:51:48.805
ACCURATE WATER DATA MODELING

00:51:48.872 --> 00:51:51.274
PLANNING IS CRITICAL FOR OUR

00:51:51.341 --> 00:51:54.077
COMMUNITIES AND THE AGRICULTURE

00:51:54.144 --> 00:51:55.846
INDUSTRY THAT FUELS AND FEEDS

00:51:55.912 --> 00:51:58.048
ALL OF US. MY MEMBERS ALWAYS

THEMSELVES AND THEIR GOVERNMENT,

00:52:02.486 --> 00:52:04.921
AND I THINK THAT UPDATES

00:52:04.988 --> 00:52:06.556
REQUIRING DWR TO PROVIDE THOSE

00:52:06.623 --> 00:52:08.124

BILL, THIS TIMELY BILL. AND I

00:53:35.245 --> 00:53:37.714
APPRECIATE THE TRANSPARENCY AS

00:53:37.781 --> 00:53:39.716
WE NEED MORE TRANSPARENCY. OUR

00:53:39.783 --> 00:53:42.752
GROWERS ARE FARM WORKERS. OUR

00:53:42.819 --> 00:53:44.154
COMMUNITIES ABSOLUTELY NEED TO

00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:46.590
KNOW. I WOULD RATHER SEE IN REAL

00:53:46.656 --> 00:53:48.525
TIME WHAT'S GOING ON. BUT YOU

00:53:48.592 --> 00:53:52.495
KNOW, AS BEST AS WE CAN GET THAT

00:53:52.562 --> 00:53:53.363
IT'S IMPORTANT. MY QUESTION TO

00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:55.999
THE AUTHOR OR TO YOUR TECHNICAL

00:53:56.066 --> 00:53:59.636
EXPERTS IS, AS YOU, YOU KNOW,

00:53:59.703 --> 00:54:03.573
YEAR ONE, YOU FORECAST AND THEN

00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:05.442
YOU SEE THAT THERE'S A NEED TO

00:54:05.508 --> 00:54:06.843
CHANGE. IS THERE ANY ACTION THAT

00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:10.013
WILL BE TAKEN BECAUSE OF THE OF

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:12.749
ANY OF THE FORECAST CHANGES? DO

00:54:12.816 --> 00:54:15.952
WE KNOW ANYTHING LIKE THAT? DO

00:54:16.019 --> 00:54:19.789
YOU WANT TO ANSWER? NO. WELL,

00:54:19.856 --> 00:54:22.359
THE WHOLE IDEA IS TO HAVE

00:54:22.425 --> 00:54:24.894
ACCURATE FORECAST BECAUSE THAT

00:54:24.961 --> 00:54:28.098
ALLOWS WITH CERTAINTY FOR A

00:54:28.164 --> 00:54:31.234
GROWER TO PLANT OR KNOWING JUST

00:54:31.301 --> 00:54:33.069
KIND OF AS MUCH IN ADVANCE HOW

00:54:33.136 --> 00:54:36.272
MUCH WATER THEY'LL HAVE. BUT

00:54:36.339 --> 00:54:40.176
WHEN THINGS ARE KIND OF

00:54:40.243 --> 00:54:41.745
UNPREDICTABLE OR UP IN THE AIR,

00:54:41.811 --> 00:54:44.347
IT MAKES EVERYTHING THAT MUCH

00:54:44.414 --> 00:54:46.316
MORE CHALLENGING. AND SO

00:54:46.383 --> 00:54:49.552
ENSURING THAT THE MODELS ARE AS

00:54:49.619 --> 00:54:51.421
ACCURATE AS POSSIBLE AND ALSO IN

00:54:51.488 --> 00:54:54.391
REAL TIME, JUST PROVIDES THAT AT

00:54:54.457 --> 00:54:56.960
LEAST STABILITY TO KNOW WHAT

00:54:57.027 --> 00:54:59.396
WHAT IS AHEAD AND THAT THERE'S

00:54:59.462 --> 00:55:02.632
CONSISTENCY AND NOT.

00:55:02.699 --> 00:55:05.201
INCONSISTENCY FROM, FROM YEAR TO

00:55:05.268 --> 00:55:08.038
YEAR. WELL, ADD TO THAT IF I

00:55:08.104 --> 00:55:11.608
COULD, TO ECHO THE SENATOR, MORE

00:55:11.675 --> 00:55:12.942
INFORMATION FOR OUR GROWERS IS

00:55:13.009 --> 00:55:15.512
BETTER. SO THE MORE INFORMATION

00:55:15.578 --> 00:55:19.182
THAT THEY HAVE TO PLAN AND

00:55:19.249 --> 00:55:21.484
PREPARE AND WOULD BE IDEAL.

00:55:21.551 --> 00:55:24.654
OKAY. THANK YOU. AND I

00:55:24.721 --> 00:55:26.456
APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE TO THESE

00:55:26.523 --> 00:55:27.924
QUESTIONS. AND I GET IT. WE'RE

00:55:27.991 --> 00:55:29.225
TRYING TO GET MORE INFORMATION.

00:55:29.292 --> 00:55:30.727
AND I AND I TRULY APPRECIATE

00:55:30.794 --> 00:55:32.462

00:55:32.529 --> 00:55:34.497
I'LL BE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL.

00:55:34.564 --> 00:55:38.334

00:56:56.312 --> 00:56:59.115
MEETINGS HAVE TO HAPPEN. HOW ARE

00:56:59.182 --> 00:57:03.253
THOSE FOUR LOCATIONS CHOSEN. WE

00:57:03.319 --> 00:57:05.388
TRY TO ENSURE THAT THERE WERE

00:57:05.455 --> 00:57:07.490
THAT THOSE LOCATIONS WERE

00:57:07.557 --> 00:57:08.725
THROUGHOUT THE STATE, NOT JUST

00:57:08.792 --> 00:57:12.228
IN ONE PART, BUT WE I KNOW THAT

00:57:12.295 --> 00:57:14.164
WE DID WORK WITH THE CHAIR AND

00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:19.002
HER COMMITTEE TO REFINE THAT.

00:57:19.068 --> 00:57:21.671
AND ARE YOU OPEN TO FURTHER

00:57:21.738 --> 00:57:26.342
REFINING THAT? I ASK BECAUSE IF

00:57:26.409 --> 00:57:28.778
THE INTENTION OF THIS IS TO GET

00:57:28.845 --> 00:57:29.946
THROUGHOUT THE STATE, THERE'S

00:57:30.013 --> 00:57:30.947
ONE THAT SAYS NEBULOUSLY ONE

00:57:31.014 --> 00:57:32.715
MEETING IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

00:57:32.782 --> 00:57:34.517
OTHER THAN THAT, THE MOST

00:57:34.584 --> 00:57:36.386
NORTHERN THIS GOES TO SANTA

00:57:36.452 --> 00:57:39.222
CLARA, WHICH THERE STILL NINE

00:57:39.289 --> 00:57:40.757
HOURS OF DRIVING NORTH OF THAT

00:57:40.824 --> 00:57:42.792
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT

00:57:42.859 --> 00:57:44.027
ISN'T REPRESENTED. AND IN FACT,

00:57:44.093 --> 00:57:45.795
ONE OF THE EARLY OPPOSITION

00:57:45.862 --> 00:57:47.330
LETTERS THAT I THINK HAS BEEN

00:57:47.397 --> 00:57:48.998
REMOVED WAS THE DELTA. AS A

00:57:49.065 --> 00:57:52.202
SUGGESTION, I THINK I HAVE THE

00:57:52.268 --> 00:57:53.536
MOST CURRENT ITERATION OF THE

00:57:53.603 --> 00:57:55.438
BILL. I'VE GOT CITY OF REDDING,

SANTA FE AND SAN FRANCISCO. THIS

00:58:04.647 --> 00:58:05.515
IS NOT THE MOST CURRENT

00:58:05.582 --> 00:58:08.117
PROPOSAL. OKAY. THESE ARE THE

00:58:08.184 --> 00:58:09.886
COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE

00:58:09.953 --> 00:58:12.388
BEING PROPOSED. I'M HAPPY TO

00:58:12.455 --> 00:58:14.324
SUPPORT THE BILL. I WOULD ALSO

00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:15.992
LIKE TO SEE AN OPTION THAT GOES

00:58:16.059 --> 00:58:18.995
NORTH INTO NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.

00:58:19.062 --> 00:58:32.041

GET SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE

00:58:38.314 --> 00:58:40.216
NORTH. I DON'T THINK THAT SHOULD

00:58:40.283 --> 00:58:42.118
BE A BIG ISSUE, BUT I DO WANT TO

00:58:42.185 --> 00:58:43.686
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING CLIMATE

00:58:43.753 --> 00:58:46.522

UNPREDICTABILITY AS WE HAVE

00:58:47.156 --> 00:58:49.492
THESE DELUGES OF RAIN AND THEN

00:58:49.559 --> 00:58:52.629
PERIODS OF DROUGHT. SO AN ANNUAL

00:58:52.695 --> 00:58:54.464
ASSESSMENT WITH NEW FOREST

MORE ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS MODELS

00:59:19.756 --> 00:59:21.190

TULARE BASIN DURING THE HISTORIC

01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:36.366
WINTER OF 2023 WAS A STARK

01:00:56.185 --> 01:00:57.220
MULTI-BENEFIT FLOODPLAIN

01:00:57.286 --> 01:00:58.021
RESTORATION THAT GIVES RIVERS

01:00:58.087 --> 01:00:59.956
AND FLOOD WATERS ROOM TO SPREAD

01:01:00.023 --> 01:01:01.624
OUT, SLOW DOWN, AND SINK INTO

01:01:01.691 --> 01:01:03.659
THE REGION'S OVERSTRESSED

01:01:03.726 --> 01:01:05.828
AQUIFERS. RATHER THAN HARMING

01:01:05.895 --> 01:01:08.898
PEOPLE, CROPS, AND PROPERTY.

01:01:08.965 --> 01:01:10.066
FLOODPLAIN RESTORATION PROJECTS,

01:01:10.133 --> 01:01:11.934
SIMILAR TO THOSE PROPOSED IN SB

01:01:12.001 --> 01:01:13.770
556, PRODUCED NUMEROUS

01:01:13.836 --> 01:01:14.871
CO-BENEFITS BEYOND IMPROVED

01:01:14.937 --> 01:01:16.939
FLOOD SAFETY AND GROUNDWATER

01:01:17.006 --> 01:01:18.875
RECHARGE. SOME OF THESE BENEFITS

01:01:18.941 --> 01:01:19.876
INCLUDE FISH AND WILDLIFE

01:01:19.942 --> 01:01:21.511
HABITAT RESTORATION, CREATION OF

01:01:21.577 --> 01:01:23.880
GOOD PAYING JOBS WHICH WE

01:01:23.946 --> 01:01:25.815
DESPERATELY NEED IN THE CENTRAL

01:01:25.882 --> 01:01:27.083
VALLEY, NATURAL CARBON

01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:28.484
SEQUESTRATION, CLEAN WATER, AND

01:01:28.551 --> 01:01:30.019
RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:01:30.086 --> 01:01:31.387
UNDERSERVED CENTRAL VALLEY

01:01:31.454 --> 01:01:33.456
COMMUNITIES. FLOODPLAIN

01:01:33.523 --> 01:01:34.957
RESTORATION IS A COMMON SENSE,

01:01:35.024 --> 01:01:36.426
PROVEN, AND SCALABLE SOLUTION

01:01:36.492 --> 01:01:38.227
THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN

01:01:38.294 --> 01:01:39.295
IMPLEMENTED ACROSS TENS OF

01:01:39.362 --> 01:01:40.930
THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF LAND

01:01:40.997 --> 01:01:42.565
THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY,

01:01:42.632 --> 01:01:44.700
AND WITHOUT ACTION IN OUR

01:01:44.767 --> 01:01:46.502
REGION, THE TULARE BASIN IS LEFT

01:01:46.569 --> 01:01:47.603
VULNERABLE TO BILLIONS OF

01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:49.772
DOLLARS OF FUTURE DAMAGE AND

01:01:49.839 --> 01:01:51.607
SACRIFICING MAJOR OPPORTUNITIES

01:01:51.674 --> 01:01:53.810
TO RECHARGE GROUNDWATER AND

01:01:53.876 --> 01:01:56.579
SUPPORT THE LOCAL AG COMMUNITY.

01:01:56.646 --> 01:01:58.815
SB 556 HAS BEEN EMBRACED BY

01:01:58.881 --> 01:02:00.149
FARMERS, ENVIRONMENTALISTS,

01:02:00.216 --> 01:02:02.351

DISTRICTS AND MY COLLEAGUES ON

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:05.588
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. I'M

01:02:05.655 --> 01:02:07.924
CONFIDENT THAT THE EFFECTS OF SB

01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:09.992
556 WILL SERVE TO ENHANCE THE

01:02:10.059 --> 01:02:10.993
ENVIRONMENT, THE ECONOMY AND,

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:12.228
MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE QUALITY OF

01:02:12.295 --> 01:02:13.796
LIFE FOR RESIDENTS THROUGHOUT

01:02:13.863 --> 01:02:15.631
THE SOUTHERN CENTRAL VALLEY. AND

01:02:15.698 --> 01:02:18.134
WITH ME TODAY, I HAVE MAYOR SAUL

01:02:18.201 --> 01:02:20.369
OF THE CITY OF MCFARLAND AND

01:02:20.436 --> 01:02:22.572
JULIE RATNER, PRESIDENT OF RIVER

QUESTIONS. GOOD MORNING,

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:34.484
ASSEMBLY MEMBERS, CAN YOU HEAR

01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:36.619
ME? AND THANK YOU FOR THE

01:02:36.686 --> 01:02:37.653
OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.088
TODAY. I STAND BEFORE YOU NOT

01:02:39.155 --> 01:02:41.557
ONLY AS THE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF

01:02:41.624 --> 01:02:42.592
MCFARLAND, BUT THE VOICE OF A

01:02:42.658 --> 01:02:44.127
SMALL, RESILIENT COMMUNITY THAT

01:02:44.193 --> 01:02:46.395
HAS ENDURED MORE THAN 40 YEARS

01:02:46.462 --> 01:02:48.965
OF HARDSHIP DUE TO THIS REPEATED

01:02:49.031 --> 01:02:50.266
FLOOD, REPEATED FLOODING FROM

01:02:50.333 --> 01:02:52.068
BATTLE CREEK. FOR DECADES, OUR

01:02:52.135 --> 01:02:54.170
COMMUNITY HAS LIVED WITH THE

01:02:54.237 --> 01:02:55.271
DEVASTATING IMPACTS OF FLOOD

01:02:55.338 --> 01:02:57.140
WATERS. THESE FLOODS DISRUPT OUR

01:02:57.206 --> 01:02:59.709
DAILY LIVES, THREATEN OUR HOMES,

01:02:59.775 --> 01:03:02.211
OUR SCHOOLS, OUR STREETS FOR A

01:03:02.278 --> 01:03:03.980
LOW INCOME, UNDERSERVED

01:03:04.046 --> 01:03:05.815
COMMUNITY, THE SOURCE OF

01:03:05.882 --> 01:03:07.216
FLOODING LIES BEYOND OUR CITY

01:03:07.283 --> 01:03:09.385
LIMITS. WHEN POSO CREEK

01:03:09.452 --> 01:03:10.853
OVERFLOWS, FLOOD WATERS PASS

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:12.922
THROUGH A LARGE ANIMAL

01:03:12.989 --> 01:03:14.390
CONFINEMENT, WHICH IS A DAIRY OR

01:03:14.457 --> 01:03:17.960
A FEEDLOT HOUSING THOUSANDS OF

01:03:18.027 --> 01:03:19.762
CATTLE BEFORE ENTERING OUR

01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:21.597
COMMUNITY. THIS IS SIMPLY NOT

01:03:21.664 --> 01:03:23.699
JUST STORMWATER. IT'S WATER

01:03:23.766 --> 01:03:24.800
CONTAMINATED WITH ANIMAL WASTE,

01:03:24.867 --> 01:03:26.202
CREATING A SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH

01:03:26.269 --> 01:03:28.571
AND ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARD. AND

01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:30.339
THIS CONTAMINATED RUNOFF DOESN'T

01:03:30.406 --> 01:03:32.008
JUST STOP AT OUR CITY EDGE. IT

01:03:32.074 --> 01:03:34.677
GOES THROUGH OUR LOW INCOME,

01:03:34.744 --> 01:03:36.979
UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY. MARK

01:03:37.046 --> 01:03:38.347
MCFARLAND HAS DONE EVERYTHING IN

01:03:38.414 --> 01:03:40.149
HIS POWER TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.

01:03:40.216 --> 01:03:42.018
WE WORK WITH LANDOWNERS, STOP

01:03:42.084 --> 01:03:43.719
PATCHWORK FUNDING, AND RESPOND

01:03:43.786 --> 01:03:45.855
TO THE BEST WE CAN WITH LIMITED

01:03:45.922 --> 01:03:46.956
RESOURCES. BUT THE TRUTH IS, WE

01:03:47.023 --> 01:03:49.659
CANNOT DO IT BY OURSELVES. WITH

01:03:49.725 --> 01:03:51.861
SB 556, THE FLOODPLAIN

01:03:51.928 --> 01:03:53.329
RESTORATION BILL, SENATOR

01:03:53.396 --> 01:03:55.464
MELISSA HURTADO HAS DEMONSTRATED

01:03:55.531 --> 01:03:56.899
TRUE LEADERSHIP AND A DEEP

01:03:56.966 --> 01:03:58.067
COMMITMENT TO THE CENTRAL

01:03:58.134 --> 01:04:01.304
VALLEY. THIS BILL PROPOSES A $20

01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:03.239
MILLION INVESTMENT TOWARD FLOOD

01:04:03.306 --> 01:04:03.973
MITIGATION. SOURCE OF THE

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.775
PROBLEM, WHICH IS POSO CREEK.

01:04:05.841 --> 01:04:07.276
THIS IS NOT A BILL. IT'S A LONG

01:04:07.343 --> 01:04:08.811
OVERDUE, COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION

01:04:08.878 --> 01:04:10.213
TO THE CRISIS THAT HAS PLAGUED

01:04:10.279 --> 01:04:12.782
OUR CITY FOR GENERATIONS. THIS

01:04:12.848 --> 01:04:13.883
FUNDING REPRESENTS MORE THAN

01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:15.251
DOLLARS. IT REPRESENTS HOPE.

01:04:15.318 --> 01:04:17.019
KEEPING OUR CHILDREN SAFE. OUR

01:04:17.086 --> 01:04:18.654
FAMILIES NO LONGER LIVE IN

01:04:18.721 --> 01:04:19.855
CONSTANT THREAT. IT'S A STEP

01:04:19.922 --> 01:04:21.624
TOWARD TOWARDS ENVIRONMENTAL

01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:23.192
JUSTICE FOR THE COMMUNITY THAT

01:04:23.259 --> 01:04:25.328
HAS LONG BEEN OVERLOOKED. TO THE

01:04:25.394 --> 01:04:27.363
MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE, I SAY

01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:29.198
THIS APPROVING SB AND SUPPORTING

01:04:29.265 --> 01:04:31.367
FIVE BY SIX IS MORE THAN A

01:04:31.434 --> 01:04:32.501
MATTER OF INFRASTRUCTURE. IT'S A

01:04:32.568 --> 01:04:33.336
MATTER OF JUSTICE, HEALTH AND

01:04:33.402 --> 01:04:35.371
SAFETY. IT'S A CHANCE TO CORRECT

01:04:35.438 --> 01:04:36.172
A LONG STANDING WRONG, TO ENSURE

01:04:36.239 --> 01:04:38.107
THAT SMALL COMMUNITIES HAVE ARE

01:04:38.174 --> 01:04:40.676
NOT FORGOTTEN IN CALIFORNIA'S

01:04:40.743 --> 01:04:41.811
BROADER FLOOD MANAGEMENT

01:04:41.877 --> 01:04:43.346
EFFORTS. ON BEHALF OF OUR

01:04:43.412 --> 01:04:44.347
COMMUNITY, I RESPECTFULLY URGE

01:04:44.413 --> 01:04:45.848
YOU TO APPROVE APPROVE SENATE

01:04:45.915 --> 01:04:48.384
BILL 556 TO THAT TOGETHER, LET'S

01:04:48.451 --> 01:04:50.886
END THIS FLOODING, THE CYCLE OF

01:04:50.953 --> 01:04:52.488
FLOODING, AND BUILD A SAFER,

01:04:52.555 --> 01:04:52.989
STRONGER, MORE RESILIENT

01:04:53.055 --> 01:04:54.790
MCFARLAND. I JUST WANT TO ADD

01:04:54.857 --> 01:04:57.360
THE FINANCIAL BURDEN IS CRUSHING

01:04:57.426 --> 01:04:59.128
FOR CLOSE TO 40% OF OUR

01:04:59.195 --> 01:05:01.631
RESIDENTS LIVE UNDER THE POVERTY

01:05:01.697 --> 01:05:04.233
LINE. THEY HAVE TO GET FLOOD

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:07.503
INSURANCE DUE TO THE TO THE FACT

01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:09.505
THAT WE'RE IN A FLOODPLAIN, AND

01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:11.307
JUST FIXING THIS INFRASTRUCTURE

01:05:11.374 --> 01:05:12.475
WOULD SAVE A LOT OF THOUSANDS

01:05:12.541 --> 01:05:13.542
PER YEAR. WHAT THESE FAMILIES

01:05:13.609 --> 01:05:16.846
COULD DO WITH IT. ALSO, WHEN I

01:05:16.912 --> 01:05:19.548
MENTIONED OUR STREETS, HOMES AND

01:05:19.615 --> 01:05:21.384
YOU KNOW, OUR KIDS DON'T, LET'S

01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:23.219
NOT FORGET ABOUT OUR BELOVED

01:05:23.286 --> 01:05:24.453
ANIMALS. WE HAVE TO FIND A PLACE

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:27.023
FOR THEM AS WELL. BUT I WANT TO

01:05:27.089 --> 01:05:28.557
END BY SHARING A PERSONAL MOMENT

01:05:28.624 --> 01:05:30.426
THAT HAS STAYED WITH ME FOR A

01:05:30.493 --> 01:05:32.094
WHILE IN MARCH. IN 2020 MARCH

01:05:32.161 --> 01:05:34.463
2023, WE HAD OUR LAST FLOOD

01:05:34.530 --> 01:05:36.265
INCIDENT. I RECEIVED A CALL FROM

01:05:36.332 --> 01:05:39.168
MY FATHER AT ABOUT 1 OR 2 IN THE

01:05:39.235 --> 01:05:40.970
MORNING. HE TELLS ME, HEY, WHY

01:05:41.037 --> 01:05:42.938
DO I HAVE TO RELOCATE? THE

01:05:43.005 --> 01:05:45.207
POLICE OFFICERS ARE MAKING ME

01:05:45.274 --> 01:05:46.642
EVACUATE. AND HE SAYS, AND I

01:05:46.709 --> 01:05:48.644
SAID, WELL, THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE

01:05:48.711 --> 01:05:49.945
TO DO BECAUSE THE WATER MIGHT,

01:05:50.012 --> 01:05:51.380

SHARE. I'VE ONLY BEEN IN OFFICE

FOR THREE MONTHS. RIGHT. SO

01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:58.988
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO FIX THE

01:05:59.055 --> 01:06:00.523
PROBLEM RIGHT AWAY. AND AT THAT

01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:03.192

01:07:21.771 --> 01:07:22.972
THE FLOODPLAINS OF OUR CREEKS

01:07:23.038 --> 01:07:24.607

COMMUNITY SAFETY ACROSS THE

01:07:29.745 --> 01:07:31.447

01:07:31.514 --> 01:07:32.882
LOCAL LEADERSHIP LIKE THAT

HUMANS AND COMMUNITIES ALL OVER

01:07:41.223 --> 01:07:44.760
THE CENTRAL VALLEY. FRANKLY, THE

01:07:44.827 --> 01:07:46.462
ISSUES, THE JOINT ISSUES THAT

01:07:46.529 --> 01:07:48.230
CLIMATE CHANGE IS BRINGING UPON

01:07:48.297 --> 01:07:50.466
THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN INCREASED

01:07:50.533 --> 01:07:52.334
INTENSITY OF FLOODING AND

01:07:52.401 --> 01:07:54.036
INCREASED SEVERITY OF DROUGHTS.

01:07:54.103 --> 01:07:56.539
LONG DURATION DROUGHTS MAKE THIS

01:07:56.605 --> 01:07:58.073
CLIMATE RESILIENT SOLUTION VERY

01:07:58.140 --> 01:07:59.909
URGENT AND IMPORTANT. WE NEED TO

01:07:59.975 --> 01:08:02.011
GET TO WORK, AND THERE'S NO

01:08:02.077 --> 01:08:04.947

01:08:05.014 --> 01:08:06.348
MANY MORE FLOODPLAIN RESTORATION

01:08:06.415 --> 01:08:07.349

FUNDED UNDER SB 556 THAT ARE

01:08:09.185 --> 01:08:10.653

01:08:10.719 --> 01:08:11.687

01:08:14.156 --> 01:08:15.991
RIGHT, AS A REAL ENDORSEMENT

01:08:16.058 --> 01:08:17.493
THAT CALIFORNIA SEES A FUTURE

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:20.362
THAT'S INNOVATIVE AND INTEGRATED

01:08:20.429 --> 01:08:22.898
NATURE, WILDLIFE, WATER SYSTEM

01:08:22.965 --> 01:08:25.100
IMPROVEMENTS, GOOD PAYING JOBS.

01:08:25.167 --> 01:08:25.801
FRANKLY, A FLOODPLAIN

01:08:25.868 --> 01:08:27.169
RESTORATION PROGRAM IS NEEDED AT

01:08:27.236 --> 01:08:28.370
THE STATE BUDGET, BUT WE DON'T

01:08:28.437 --> 01:08:29.738
HAVE ONE. AND FRANKLY, DEEPER

01:08:29.805 --> 01:08:32.241
INVESTMENT IN THE BASIN IS

01:08:32.308 --> 01:08:33.642
NEEDED AS WELL. AND WE DON'T

01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:38.080
HAVE THAT. THIS BILL WOULD

01:08:38.147 --> 01:08:39.815
SUPPORT FLOODPLAIN RESTORATION

01:08:39.882 --> 01:08:41.150
IN THE TULARE BASIN IN

01:08:41.217 --> 01:08:42.318
PARTICULAR, WHICH IS A GEOGRAPHY

01:08:42.384 --> 01:08:44.453
THAT IS DEEPLY UNDERINVESTED IN

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.856
AND OF STATEWIDE IMPORTANCE. THE

01:08:46.922 --> 01:08:48.491
COST OF DISASTER RECOVERY, AS

01:08:48.557 --> 01:08:50.559
THE MAYOR JUST DESCRIBED, IS

01:08:50.626 --> 01:08:52.161
ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE HIGHER THAN

THE COST OF INVESTMENT IN

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:55.931
PREVENTION OF THOSE DISASTERS,

01:08:55.998 --> 01:08:57.466

01:09:02.137 --> 01:09:04.306
MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE SPACE

01:09:04.373 --> 01:09:06.141
TO LET WATER FLOW WHERE IT NEEDS

01:09:06.208 --> 01:09:08.611
TO FLOW, CAN AVOID CATASTROPHE,

01:09:08.677 --> 01:09:10.679
LOSS OF LIFE AND LOSS OF

01:09:10.746 --> 01:09:13.682

FOR WORKING WITH US. AND I'M

01:20:13.875 --> 01:20:14.509
ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE

01:20:14.576 --> 01:20:15.510
AMENDMENTS WITH THE COMMITMENT

01:20:15.577 --> 01:20:17.379
THAT WE WILL BE CONTINUING SOME

01:20:17.445 --> 01:20:20.649
DISCUSSIONS MOVING FORWARD. WE I

01:20:20.715 --> 01:20:21.816
DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO

01:20:21.883 --> 01:20:24.152
OUTLINE THE OUR CONVERSATIONS,

01:20:24.219 --> 01:20:25.253
MADAM CHAIR, AT SOME POINT, BUT

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:27.489
I THINK THE MEMBERS HAVE BEEN

01:20:27.556 --> 01:20:32.160
APPRIZED. SO THIS ULTIMATELY WAS

01:20:32.227 --> 01:20:37.632
CENTERED ON THE EFFORT TO TRY TO

01:20:37.699 --> 01:20:39.034
HELP OUR PARKS DEPARTMENT DO

01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:40.468
MORE TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES AND

01:20:40.535 --> 01:20:42.037
THE ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING

01:20:42.103 --> 01:20:43.104
HELPING OUR STATE REACH ITS 30

01:20:43.171 --> 01:20:45.540
BY 30 GOALS. THE PARKS

01:20:45.607 --> 01:20:46.541
DEPARTMENT HAS LIMITED FUNDS

01:20:46.608 --> 01:20:47.976
AVAILABLE TO PURCHASE CRITICAL

01:20:48.043 --> 01:20:49.744
LANDS NEEDED TO INCREASE OUTDOOR

01:20:49.811 --> 01:20:53.014
ACCESS AND PROTECT HABITAT. AND

01:20:53.081 --> 01:20:54.849
AFTER SPENDING A BIT OF TIME ON

01:20:54.916 --> 01:20:55.984
THIS ISSUE, I'VE REALLY COME TO

01:20:56.051 --> 01:20:58.520
THE CONCLUSION THAT WE NEED TO

01:20:58.587 --> 01:20:59.888
REMOVE SOME BUREAUCRATIC

01:20:59.955 --> 01:21:01.957
BARRIERS THAT ARE CURRENTLY

01:21:02.023 --> 01:21:03.458
IMPACTING OUR ABILITY TO STRETCH

01:21:03.525 --> 01:21:06.661
EVERY DOLLAR. EVEN SIMPLE

01:21:06.728 --> 01:21:08.163
ACQUISITIONS BY THE DEPARTMENT

01:21:08.230 --> 01:21:09.965
HAVE ROUTINELY TAKEN MULTIPLE

01:21:10.031 --> 01:21:11.933
YEARS DUE TO ONEROUS AND

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.201
OFTENTIMES DUPLICATIVE

01:21:13.268 --> 01:21:15.437
REQUIREMENTS AND REVIEW BY DGS

01:21:15.503 --> 01:21:17.472
AND THE PUBLIC WORKS BOARD. BOTH

01:21:17.539 --> 01:21:19.541
OF THOSE DEPARTMENTS HAVE

01:21:19.608 --> 01:21:21.309
SIGNIFICANT BACKLOGS, SOMETIMES

01:21:21.376 --> 01:21:24.379
IN SOME CASES YEARS WORTH OF

01:21:24.446 --> 01:21:26.147
BACKLOG JUST IN TERMS OF

01:21:26.214 --> 01:21:27.082
PROCESSING THEIR ACQUISITION

01:21:27.148 --> 01:21:29.084
PACKAGES FROM ALL THE DIFFERENT

01:21:29.150 --> 01:21:30.785
STATE DEPARTMENTS THAT THEY HAVE

01:21:30.852 --> 01:21:32.587
TO APPROVE. NOW, THE STANDARD

01:21:32.654 --> 01:21:34.389
REVIEW PROCESS FOR PURCHASES

01:21:34.456 --> 01:21:35.824
MIGHT MAKE SENSE WHEN

01:21:35.890 --> 01:21:37.192
CONSIDERING SIGNIFICANT

01:21:37.259 --> 01:21:39.060
TRANSACTIONS, BUT IT REALLY DOES

01:21:39.127 --> 01:21:40.562
IMPOSE AN OUTSIZED BURDEN ON

01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:42.297
SIMPLER TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING

01:21:42.364 --> 01:21:45.233
DGS STAFF COSTS THAT CAN REACH

01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:47.602
$90,000 PER PER PURCHASE. AND

01:21:47.669 --> 01:21:49.004
WE'VE HAD SOME VERY SMALL

01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:50.905
PURCHASES THAT HAVE GOTTEN

01:21:50.972 --> 01:21:53.174
BACKLOGGED SIGNIFICANTLY AS A

01:21:53.241 --> 01:21:57.445
RESULT OF THIS SITUATION. SO AND

01:21:57.512 --> 01:21:58.747
THERE'S A THERE'S A PROBLEM ON

01:21:58.813 --> 01:22:00.181
OUR HANDS AS A RESULT, THE STATE

01:22:00.248 --> 01:22:03.952
PARKS HAS A BACKLOG OF SIMPLE,

01:22:04.019 --> 01:22:06.054
STRAIGHTFORWARD ACQUISITIONS.

01:22:06.121 --> 01:22:08.590
HEY, THERE WE GO. THAT'S ALL

01:22:08.657 --> 01:22:10.759
RIGHT. I WAS I WAS MONITORING

01:22:10.825 --> 01:22:12.961
THE BACK TO THE FUTURE HERE.

01:22:13.028 --> 01:22:17.299
OKAY. YEAH. BUT BUT BUT STATE

01:22:17.365 --> 01:22:19.134
PARKS HAS AMASSED THIS THIS THIS

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:20.602
THERE'S A BACKLOG OF SIMPLE,

01:22:20.669 --> 01:22:21.936
STRAIGHTFORWARD ACQUISITIONS

01:22:22.003 --> 01:22:23.672
SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS NO

01:22:23.738 --> 01:22:24.806
BRAINER TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING

01:22:24.873 --> 01:22:29.277
52 PROJECTS OF DONATIONS OF

01:22:29.344 --> 01:22:31.680
SMALL ACREAGE. AND THE OTHER

01:22:31.746 --> 01:22:33.515
KIND OF ASPECT OF THIS IS THAT

01:22:33.581 --> 01:22:34.616
THE PUBLIC HAS LOST AN UNTOLD

01:22:34.683 --> 01:22:35.717
NUMBER OF OPPORTUNITIES TO

01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:36.951
SECURE CRITICAL PARCELS AS A

01:22:37.018 --> 01:22:38.853
RESULT OF A PROTRACTED AND

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:39.554
DUPLICATIVE PROCESS. SOME

01:22:39.621 --> 01:22:40.622
PROPERTY OWNERS WON'T EVEN

01:22:40.689 --> 01:22:41.656
CONSIDER BRINGING PROJECTS TO

01:22:41.723 --> 01:22:43.124
STATE PARKS BECAUSE THEY JUST

01:22:43.191 --> 01:22:44.693
CAN'T HOLD ON TO THE PROPERTIES

01:22:44.759 --> 01:22:46.061
INDEFINITELY WHILE AWAITING

01:22:46.127 --> 01:22:47.495
APPROVAL, AND THE WORD'S GOTTEN

01:22:47.562 --> 01:22:48.797
OUT AS TO THE PROBLEMS

01:22:48.863 --> 01:22:51.099
ASSOCIATED WITH WITH WITH GIVING

01:22:51.166 --> 01:22:53.234
PROPERTY TO PARKS. AND IN

01:22:53.301 --> 01:22:54.602
ADDITION, WHILE EXISTING LAW

01:22:54.669 --> 01:22:56.438
AUTHORIZES DGS TO WAIVE ITS

01:22:56.504 --> 01:22:59.007
REVIEW AND APPROVE APPROVAL FOR

01:22:59.074 --> 01:23:01.209
ANY REAL ESTATE ACQUISITION OR

01:23:01.276 --> 01:23:02.944
CONVEYANCE INVOLVING LESS THAN

01:23:03.011 --> 01:23:04.212
$150,000, THIS AMOUNT HAS NOT

01:23:04.279 --> 01:23:06.281
BEEN ADJUSTED SINCE 1998, AND IT

01:23:06.348 --> 01:23:07.916
SIMPLY DOESN'T. SO THERE'S BEEN

01:23:07.982 --> 01:23:09.818
NO THERE'S NO COST OF LIVING.

01:23:09.884 --> 01:23:11.586
ESCALATOR. WE ALL KNOW HOW MUCH

01:23:11.653 --> 01:23:12.987
LAND VALUES HAVE INCREDIBLY

01:23:13.054 --> 01:23:14.856
INCREASED. INCREDIBLY, SINCE

01:23:14.923 --> 01:23:17.992
1998. AND SO WE'RE STUCK WITH

01:23:18.059 --> 01:23:19.594
THESE OLD NUMBERS. AND IT'S

01:23:19.661 --> 01:23:20.495
REALLY IMPACTING STATES OF STATE

01:23:20.562 --> 01:23:22.197
PARKS ABILITY TO GROW. SO THIS

01:23:22.263 --> 01:23:24.232
BILL WOULD STREAMLINE STATE

01:23:24.299 --> 01:23:25.533
PARKS REAL PROPERTY TRANSACTIONS

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:27.402
BY REMOVING DUPLICATIVE REVIEWS

01:23:27.469 --> 01:23:28.970
FOR SIMPLE ACQUISITIONS,

01:23:29.037 --> 01:23:30.772
ALLOWING THE PARKS TO BE MORE

01:23:30.839 --> 01:23:32.140
RESPONSIVE IN WORKING WITH LOCAL

01:23:32.207 --> 01:23:33.575
AGENCIES AND NONPROFIT PARTNERS

01:23:33.641 --> 01:23:34.776
TO ADDRESS PRESSING NEEDS FOR

01:23:34.843 --> 01:23:36.444
PARK ACCESS, INFRASTRUCTURE AND

01:23:36.511 --> 01:23:39.013
OPERATIONS. EXISTING OVERSIGHT

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:40.482
REQUIREMENTS WOULD REMAIN FOR

01:23:40.548 --> 01:23:41.750
MORE SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS

01:23:41.816 --> 01:23:42.684
THAT MEET ANY OF THE FOLLOWING

01:23:42.751 --> 01:23:45.120
CRITERIA THE CREATION OF A NEW

01:23:45.186 --> 01:23:45.787
STATE PARK OF COURSE TRANSACTION

01:23:45.854 --> 01:23:47.756
REQUIRING STATE PARKS TO EXPEND

01:23:47.822 --> 01:23:48.723
MORE THAN $1 MILLION OR THE

01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:50.525
PROPERTY WOULD REQUIRE CAPITAL

01:23:50.592 --> 01:23:51.593
IMPROVEMENTS OR ADDITIONAL

01:23:51.659 --> 01:23:53.228
FINANCIAL RESOURCES. BEYOND THE

01:23:53.294 --> 01:23:55.497
STATE PARKS BUDGETED RESOURCES.

01:23:55.563 --> 01:23:57.365
IN ADDITION, THE BILL WOULD

01:23:57.432 --> 01:23:59.200
RAISE THE THRESHOLD AT WHICH DGS

01:23:59.267 --> 01:24:00.201
IS AUTHORIZED TO WAIVE ITS

01:24:00.268 --> 01:24:01.970
REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF STATE

01:24:02.036 --> 01:24:03.805
REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS, AND

01:24:03.872 --> 01:24:04.873
THIS WILL REDUCE THE BACKLOG

01:24:04.939 --> 01:24:06.374
OVER THERE AND ALLOW DGS TO

01:24:06.441 --> 01:24:08.476
FOCUS ON LARGER AND MORE COMPLEX

01:24:08.543 --> 01:24:09.411
ACQUISITIONS THAT REQUIRE

01:24:09.477 --> 01:24:11.780
ADDITIONAL REVIEW. SO TESTIFYING

01:24:11.846 --> 01:24:13.581
WITH ME IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL

01:24:13.648 --> 01:24:14.382
TODAY, WE HAVE MICHAEL JARRETT,

01:24:14.449 --> 01:24:15.984

01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:26.995
CONSERVANCY. THE NATURE

01:24:27.061 --> 01:24:28.263
CONSERVANCY IS PROUD TO SUPPORT

01:24:28.329 --> 01:24:29.364
THIS IMPORTANT BILL AND THANKS

THE AUTHOR FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON

01:24:30.532 --> 01:24:34.436
THIS ISSUE. SB 630 IS A VITAL

01:24:34.502 --> 01:24:35.437
PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT

01:24:35.503 --> 01:24:37.005
SUPPORTS THE STATE'S 30 BY 30

01:24:37.071 --> 01:24:39.107
GOALS, BY MAKING IT EASIER FOR

01:24:39.174 --> 01:24:39.741
STATE PARKS TO ACQUIRE

01:24:39.808 --> 01:24:41.676
CONSERVATION LANDS, TNC HAS

01:24:41.743 --> 01:24:42.911
WORKED CLOSELY WITH STATE PARKS

01:24:42.977 --> 01:24:44.846
ON THE BOW TIE PROJECT, WHICH IS

01:24:44.913 --> 01:24:46.781
PART OF THE RIO DE LOS ANGELES

01:24:46.848 --> 01:24:48.750
STATE PARK. THE PROJECT WILL

01:24:48.817 --> 01:24:50.251
PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT STORMWATER

01:24:50.318 --> 01:24:52.053
CAPTURE BENEFITS, HABITAT AND

01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:53.521
IMPORTANT PUBLIC ACCESS. WE

01:24:53.588 --> 01:24:54.956
BELIEVE STATE PARKS CAN PROVIDE

01:24:55.023 --> 01:24:57.058
MANY BENEFITS TO CALIFORNIANS BY

01:24:57.125 --> 01:24:58.793
EXPANDING EXISTING STATE PARKS,

01:24:58.860 --> 01:25:01.896
AND SB 630 SUPPORTS THAT WORK,

01:25:01.963 --> 01:25:05.633
SENATOR ALLEN'S SB SIX 867,

01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:07.135
WHICH BECAME PROPOSITION FOUR,

01:25:07.202 --> 01:25:08.870
MADE HISTORIC INVESTMENTS IN THE

01:25:08.937 --> 01:25:10.705
PROTECTION AND CONSERVATION OF

01:25:10.772 --> 01:25:13.641
NATURE. SB 630 BUILDS ON THAT

01:25:13.708 --> 01:25:15.443
LEGACY BY REDUCING THE COST AND

01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:17.045
TIME TO MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS

01:25:17.111 --> 01:25:18.980
AT STATE PARKS, AND OFFERS AN

01:25:19.047 --> 01:25:20.582
OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE SMALLER

01:25:20.648 --> 01:25:21.916
PARCELS, OFTEN AT LITTLE OR NO

01:25:21.983 --> 01:25:24.452
COST TO THE STATE. SPECIFICALLY,

01:25:24.519 --> 01:25:26.287
SB 630 WILL STREAMLINE THE

01:25:26.354 --> 01:25:27.655
APPROVAL OF ACQUISITION OF

01:25:27.722 --> 01:25:29.858
SMALLER OR LOWER COST

01:25:29.924 --> 01:25:31.326
CONSERVATION PROPERTIES BY

01:25:31.392 --> 01:25:33.127
UTILIZING STATE PARKS APPROVAL

01:25:33.194 --> 01:25:35.230
PROCESS WHILE FOREGOING DGS AND

01:25:35.296 --> 01:25:37.031
THE STATE PUBLIC WORKS BOARD'S

01:25:37.098 --> 01:25:39.100
REVIEW, WHICH ADDS SIGNIFICANT

01:25:39.167 --> 01:25:40.802
COST AND CAN TAKE YEARS TO

01:25:40.869 --> 01:25:42.704
COMPLETE. MANY OF THESE

01:25:42.770 --> 01:25:44.072
PROPERTIES ARE IMMEDIATELY

01:25:44.138 --> 01:25:45.974
ADJACENT TO EXISTING STATE PARKS

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:48.309
AND OFFER IMPORTANT CONNECTIVITY

01:25:48.376 --> 01:25:49.143
OPPORTUNITIES FOR BOTH

01:25:49.210 --> 01:25:51.446
RECREATION AND WILDLIFE.

01:25:51.513 --> 01:25:52.714
ACCEPTING THESE PROPERTIES WILL

01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:54.282
ALSO REDUCE THE BURDENS OF

01:25:54.349 --> 01:25:56.050
MANAGING STATE PARK UNITS BY

01:25:56.117 --> 01:25:57.619
LOWERING OR ELIMINATING THE

01:25:57.685 --> 01:26:00.154
OPERATIONAL COMPLICATIONS OF

01:26:00.221 --> 01:26:01.556
INHOLDINGS AND UNLOCKING THE

01:26:01.623 --> 01:26:03.358
FINAL VISION OF THE STATE PARK,

01:26:03.424 --> 01:26:05.527
WHICH WILL INCREASE VISITATION

01:26:05.593 --> 01:26:07.729
AND REVENUE GENERATION

01:26:07.795 --> 01:26:08.796
OPPORTUNITIES. THANK YOU FOR THE

01:26:08.863 --> 01:26:09.364

GOOD MORNING, CHAIR AND

PROTECTION FOR SAVE THE REDWOODS

01:26:20.475 --> 01:26:22.510
LEAGUE. I'M NOT SURE WHY I'M

01:26:22.577 --> 01:26:23.378
HERE. THE AUTHOR GAVE SUCH A

01:26:23.444 --> 01:26:25.413
GREAT INTRODUCTION AND

01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:26.147
DISCUSSION OF THIS BILL. BUT

01:26:26.214 --> 01:26:27.916
WE'RE GOING TO TALK I'M GOING TO

01:26:27.982 --> 01:26:29.884
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR

01:26:29.951 --> 01:26:30.652
FIRST PERSON EXPERIENCE. THE

01:26:30.718 --> 01:26:31.819
LEAGUE HAS BEEN WORKING IN

01:26:31.886 --> 01:26:32.620
PARTNERSHIP WITH CALIFORNIA

01:26:32.687 --> 01:26:33.988
STATE PARKS FOR MORE THAN 100

01:26:34.055 --> 01:26:37.926
YEARS. OUR MISSION. AND IN THOSE

01:26:37.992 --> 01:26:39.060
HUNDRED YEARS, WE PROTECTED MORE

01:26:39.127 --> 01:26:41.162
THAN 220,000 ACRES OF COAST

01:26:41.229 --> 01:26:44.032
REDWOODS AND GIANT SEQUOIA,

01:26:44.098 --> 01:26:45.767
CREATING HELPING TO CREATE MORE

01:26:45.833 --> 01:26:47.201
THAN 66 LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL

01:26:47.268 --> 01:26:49.037
PARKS. OUR MISSION IS TO

01:26:49.103 --> 01:26:50.872
PROTECT, RESTORE AND CONNECT

01:26:50.939 --> 01:26:53.107
PEOPLE TO THESE INCREDIBLE

01:26:53.174 --> 01:26:54.742
RESOURCES IN THE MODERN ERA. THE

01:26:54.809 --> 01:26:57.011
LEAGUE AND OUR CONSERVATION

01:26:57.078 --> 01:26:58.346
ORGANIZATION PARTNERS, IN

01:26:58.413 --> 01:26:59.914
COORDINATION WITH PARKS, WILL

01:26:59.981 --> 01:27:01.616
STEP IN TO ACQUIRE INHOLDINGS

01:27:01.683 --> 01:27:03.451
AND OTHER IMPORTANT PROPERTIES

01:27:03.518 --> 01:27:05.687
ADJACENT TO EXISTING PARKS AND

01:27:05.753 --> 01:27:07.121
RESERVES AS THEY COME IN THE

01:27:07.188 --> 01:27:08.890
MARKET AND ARE AVAILABLE.

01:27:08.957 --> 01:27:09.891
CONSERVATION GROUPS LIKE THE

01:27:09.958 --> 01:27:11.426
LEAGUE CAN ACT QUICKLY TO SECURE

01:27:11.492 --> 01:27:13.194
THESE PROPERTIES WHEN THE STATE

01:27:13.261 --> 01:27:15.730
CANNOT. OF COURSE, THE GOAL IS

01:27:15.797 --> 01:27:17.231
TO CONVEY THESE PROPERTIES TO

01:27:17.298 --> 01:27:19.233
STATE PARKS, BUT RIGHT NOW THE

01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:21.769
SYSTEM IS BROKEN. ESSENTIALLY,

01:27:21.836 --> 01:27:23.638
THE LEAGUE CURRENTLY OWNS,

01:27:23.705 --> 01:27:26.874
MONITORS, STEWARDS AND 16

01:27:26.941 --> 01:27:27.408
PROPERTIES THROUGHOUT THE

01:27:27.475 --> 01:27:29.811
REDWOOD AND GIANT SEQUOIA RANGE

01:27:29.877 --> 01:27:31.212
THAT WE ACQUIRED AT THE REQUEST

01:27:31.279 --> 01:27:33.081
OF STATE PARKS ONE AS FAR BACK

01:27:33.147 --> 01:27:36.117
AS 1997. 12 OF THESE PROPERTIES

01:27:36.184 --> 01:27:38.086
WOULD QUALIFY FOR THE PROCESS

01:27:38.152 --> 01:27:39.621
THAT WOULD BE CREATED BY SENATOR

01:27:39.687 --> 01:27:41.856
ALLEN'S BILL. OF THOSE 12 EIGHT,

01:27:41.923 --> 01:27:43.324
WE ARE PREPARED TO TRANSFER AT

01:27:43.391 --> 01:27:45.960
NO COST TO THE STATE AT ALL. SO

01:27:46.027 --> 01:27:48.029
A DONATION THE ACQUISITION

01:27:48.096 --> 01:27:49.564
PROCESS REQUIRES DEPARTMENT OF

01:27:49.631 --> 01:27:50.865
GENERAL SERVICES TO DUPLICATE

01:27:50.932 --> 01:27:53.835
THE WORK THAT WE DO TO, IN

01:27:53.901 --> 01:27:54.936
PARTNERSHIP WITH STATE PARKS,

01:27:55.003 --> 01:27:57.071
BOTH REGIONAL AND STATE

01:27:57.138 --> 01:27:59.507
ACQUISITION STAFF. THAT INCLUDES

01:27:59.574 --> 01:28:01.776
SITE VISITS, TITLE WORK,

01:28:01.843 --> 01:28:03.244
ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND OTHER

01:28:03.311 --> 01:28:05.713
REAL ESTATE FUNCTIONS. THIS ADDS

01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:07.582
TIME AND COST TO THE STATE AND

01:28:07.649 --> 01:28:10.084
TO PARTNERS LIKE THE LEAGUE.

01:28:10.151 --> 01:28:12.153
SINCE 2008, THE LEAGUE HAS ONLY

01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:14.656
BEEN ABLE TO TRANSFER 180 ACRE

01:28:14.722 --> 01:28:15.657
INHOLDING WITHIN MONTGOMERY

01:28:15.723 --> 01:28:16.958
WOODS STATE RESERVE UP IN

01:28:17.025 --> 01:28:18.426
MENDOCINO COUNTY TO THE STATE

01:28:18.493 --> 01:28:20.428
PARK SYSTEM. OUR TEAM HAS BEEN

01:28:20.495 --> 01:28:22.797
WORKING TO TRANSFER THREE ONE

01:28:22.864 --> 01:28:25.900
HALF ACRE INHOLDINGS WITHIN

01:28:25.967 --> 01:28:27.235
EXISTING STATE PARKS TO THE

01:28:27.301 --> 01:28:29.504
STATE PARK SYSTEM. THESE ARE

01:28:29.570 --> 01:28:30.571
PROJECTS I'VE BEEN WORKING ON

01:28:30.638 --> 01:28:34.742
PERSONALLY SINCE 2022. TO DATE,

01:28:34.809 --> 01:28:35.977
NONE OF THESE PROJECTS HAS MADE

01:28:36.044 --> 01:28:37.679
IT TO THE PUBLIC WORKS BOARD.

01:28:37.745 --> 01:28:40.948
AGENDA FOR APPROVAL. THE

01:28:41.015 --> 01:28:42.083
INEFFECTIVE AND INEFFICIENT

01:28:42.150 --> 01:28:43.918
PROCESS HAS STARTED TO REALLY

01:28:43.985 --> 01:28:46.187
AFFECT OUR OUR ABILITY TO

01:28:46.254 --> 01:28:48.523
PARTNER WITH STATE PARKS. THIS

01:28:48.589 --> 01:28:50.525
THIS LAST YEAR, WE HAD TO PASS

01:28:50.591 --> 01:28:52.160
ON TWO IMPORTANT ACQUISITION

01:28:52.226 --> 01:28:52.894
OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE THE

01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:54.696
LEAGUE'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS IS

01:28:54.762 --> 01:28:56.831
HESITANT TO CONTINUE TO BUY MORE

01:28:56.898 --> 01:28:58.266
LAND. WHEN WE CAN'T TRANSFER THE

01:28:58.332 --> 01:29:00.001
LAND WE OWN INTO THE PARK

01:29:00.068 --> 01:29:01.836
SYSTEM. YOU KNOW, THESE

01:29:01.903 --> 01:29:06.874
PROPERTIES TAKE TIME TO MONITOR.

01:29:06.941 --> 01:29:10.478
ETC. SO THIS IS NOT ONLY OUR

01:29:10.545 --> 01:29:11.879
STORY. THIS IS THE STORY OF

01:29:11.946 --> 01:29:14.215
DOZENS OF NONPROFIT PARTNERS, OF

01:29:14.282 --> 01:29:15.883
OUR COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE STATE.

01:29:15.950 --> 01:29:18.086
SO IT'S AFFECTING ALL STATE PARK

01:29:18.152 --> 01:29:20.988
UNITS UP AND DOWN CALIFORNIA. SO

01:29:21.055 --> 01:29:22.323
ON BEHALF OF SAVE THE REDWOODS

01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:23.891
LEAGUE AND OUR CONSERVATION

01:29:23.958 --> 01:29:25.126
PARTNERS, WE URGE YOU TO SUPPORT

01:29:25.193 --> 01:29:27.462
THIS BILL. IF STATE PARKS CAN

01:29:27.528 --> 01:29:28.896
USE THE STREAMLINED PROCESS TO

01:29:28.963 --> 01:29:30.732
CLEAR THE BACKLOG OF PROPERTIES

01:29:30.798 --> 01:29:32.467
THAT MEET THE CRITERIA, IT WILL

01:29:32.533 --> 01:29:34.068
FREE DGS, DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

01:29:34.135 --> 01:29:36.337
AND THE PUBLIC WORKS BOARD TO

01:29:36.404 --> 01:29:37.939
FOCUS THEIR EFFORTS ON LARGER,

01:29:38.005 --> 01:29:40.041
MORE IMPORTANT, REALLY IMPORTANT

01:29:40.108 --> 01:29:42.143
PROJECTS AND ON BEHALF THAT WILL

01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:43.978
REALLY WORK TO ADVANCE THE GOALS

01:29:44.045 --> 01:29:46.914
OF THE 30 BY 30 AND CONNECT OUR

01:29:46.981 --> 01:29:48.416
PEOPLE TO THE PARKS. SO THANK

OKAY. WITH THAT, WE'LL BRING IT

01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:55.249
BACK TO THE. I SEE SOME MEMBER,

YEAH. I'D JUST LIKE TO BE ADDED

01:31:09.730 --> 01:31:12.900
AS A COAUTHOR. THANK YOU, THANK

01:31:12.967 --> 01:31:16.103
YOU. FOR IT. I THINK THE BILL IS

01:31:16.170 --> 01:31:17.939
WAY OVERDUE IN TERMS OF BEING

01:31:18.005 --> 01:31:20.541
NEEDED, GOING ALL THE WAY BACK

01:31:20.608 --> 01:31:22.643
TO 1998. I'M NOT VERY CONCERNED

01:31:22.710 --> 01:31:24.312
ABOUT THE STATE PARKS DIRECTOR

01:31:24.378 --> 01:31:26.581
GETTING OUT OF CONTROL AND

01:31:26.647 --> 01:31:29.083
ACCEPTING TOO MANY PROPERTIES

01:31:29.150 --> 01:31:33.788
INAPPROPRIATELY. AND SO I

01:31:33.855 --> 01:31:36.691
ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR TO NEXT

01:31:36.757 --> 01:31:38.192
YEAR CONSIDER THIS BILL AGAIN.

01:31:38.259 --> 01:31:40.628
AND PERHAPS MORE EXCEPTIONS. FOR

01:31:40.695 --> 01:31:42.897
EXAMPLE, LIKE FOR THE

01:31:42.964 --> 01:31:45.700
INHOLDINGS, THAT OUGHT TO BE A

01:31:45.766 --> 01:31:48.870
MUCH MORE A REAL STREAMLINED

01:31:48.936 --> 01:31:50.438
PROCESS. YOU KNOW, WE WANT TO

01:31:50.504 --> 01:31:52.173
TRY TO GET RID OF THOSE

01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:53.307
INHOLDINGS, THOSE KIND OF

01:31:53.374 --> 01:31:54.609
THINGS. AND POTENTIALLY, IF YOU

01:31:54.675 --> 01:31:57.311
LOOK AT IT, IF YOU GO FROM 1998,

01:31:57.378 --> 01:32:00.147
IN TERMS OF $150,000 AND YOU PUT

01:32:00.214 --> 01:32:01.849
THE REAL ESTATE INFLATION FACTOR

01:32:01.916 --> 01:32:04.418
ON THERE, I WOULD I WOULD COME

01:32:04.485 --> 01:32:06.187
BACK AND SEE IF PEOPLE ARE GOING

01:32:06.254 --> 01:32:07.088
TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH A HIGHER

01:32:07.154 --> 01:32:08.322
AMOUNT, BECAUSE I DON'T THINK

01:32:08.389 --> 01:32:10.925
YOU'RE GOING TO CLEAR THE

01:32:10.992 --> 01:32:15.229
BACKLOG AT $500,000. AND SO

01:32:15.296 --> 01:32:18.432
WE'VE NEGOTIATED UP TO 750,000.

01:32:18.499 --> 01:32:21.302
BUT, YOU KNOW, I'D LOVE IT TO BE

01:32:21.369 --> 01:32:23.237
HIGHER, BUT THAT'S WHERE WE ARE.

01:32:23.304 --> 01:32:24.739
AND, YOU KNOW. SURE. AND SO

01:32:24.805 --> 01:32:27.375
YEAH. AND SO AND I SUPPORT THIS

01:32:27.441 --> 01:32:29.844
BILL AS IT IS, I JUST THINK THAT

01:32:29.911 --> 01:32:31.612
WE JUST WITH MORE INFORMATION

01:32:31.679 --> 01:32:34.248
AND STUFF THAT MAY BE IT MAY BE,

01:32:34.315 --> 01:32:36.417
MAY BE APPROPRIATE AND WE MAY

01:32:36.484 --> 01:32:38.319
HAVE THE COMMITTEE, YOU KNOW, BE

01:32:38.386 --> 01:32:39.720
WILLING TO LOOK AT THAT AFTER A

01:32:39.787 --> 01:32:41.656
YEAR WHEN WE GET MORE DATA IN

01:32:41.722 --> 01:32:43.257
TERMS OF THAT. SO I'D LIKE TO BE

01:32:43.324 --> 01:32:45.493
A COAUTHOR OF THIS BILL, BUT

01:32:45.559 --> 01:32:47.194
ENCOURAGE US, BECAUSE I THINK IN

01:32:47.261 --> 01:32:50.998
THE LONG RUN, WE WANT TO TRY TO

01:32:51.065 --> 01:32:54.735
CLEAR THESE THINGS BECAUSE.

01:32:54.802 --> 01:32:57.438
NONPROFIT AGENCIES WON'T WON'T

01:32:57.505 --> 01:32:59.240
WANT TO HOLD ON TO THESE

01:32:59.307 --> 01:33:00.942
PROPERTIES FOR A LONG PERIOD OF

01:33:01.008 --> 01:33:02.243
TIME IF THEY CAN'T GET THEM OVER

01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:04.312
TO STATE PARKS, AND IF THEY IF

01:33:04.378 --> 01:33:05.246
THEY AREN'T GOOD PROPERTIES. I'M

01:33:05.313 --> 01:33:06.948
PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT THE STATE

01:33:07.014 --> 01:33:08.149
PARKS DIRECTORS ARE NOT GOING TO

01:33:08.215 --> 01:33:09.517
BE ACCEPTING PROPERTIES THAT ARE

01:33:09.583 --> 01:33:11.385
GOING TO CAUSE, YOU KNOW, UNDUE

01:33:11.452 --> 01:33:13.988
EXPENSE FOR THE STATE, ETC. SO

01:33:14.055 --> 01:33:17.458
WITH THAT, I APPRECIATE THE WORK

01:33:17.525 --> 01:33:19.327
OF THE COMMITTEE AND THE AUTHOR,

01:33:19.393 --> 01:33:21.128
AND I JUST THINK IN THE LONG

01:33:21.195 --> 01:33:22.296
RUN, WE'VE GOT MORE WORK TO DO

01:33:22.363 --> 01:33:24.966
HERE. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. AND

01:33:25.032 --> 01:33:25.800
IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S THE

01:33:25.866 --> 01:33:27.001
MAKINGS OF A BENNETT ALLEN BILL

01:33:27.068 --> 01:33:29.103

WANTED TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR

01:33:39.213 --> 01:33:40.681
BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND ALL

01:33:40.748 --> 01:33:42.083
THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT CAME OUT

01:33:42.149 --> 01:33:44.518

PUBLIC WORKS BOARD. SO THANK YOU

01:33:47.421 --> 01:33:49.056
FOR BRINGING THIS ISSUE TO

01:33:49.123 --> 01:33:51.025
LIGHT. WE'D LOVE TO MAYBE WORK

01:33:51.092 --> 01:33:52.860
ON A BENNETT ALLEN BILL NEXT

01:33:52.927 --> 01:33:58.165
YEAR TO THAT'S RIGHT TO CONTINUE

01:33:58.232 --> 01:34:00.968

01:34:01.035 --> 01:34:02.136
ALSO HAVE SOME PARKS BILL AS

01:34:02.203 --> 01:34:04.271
WELL AS INSPIRED BY OUR CHAIR,

01:34:04.338 --> 01:34:05.306
AND WOULD ALSO LOVE TO BE ADDED

01:34:05.373 --> 01:34:07.174
AS A COAUTHOR. THANK YOU, THANK

01:34:07.241 --> 01:34:10.578
YOU, THANK YOU. YES, THANK YOU.

01:34:10.644 --> 01:34:12.613
AND I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF

01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:14.181
FOCUS ON THE STATE PARKS PORTION

01:34:14.248 --> 01:34:15.716
OF IT, BUT JUST FOR CLARITY,

01:34:15.783 --> 01:34:18.085
THIS RAISES THE DGS WAIVER FOR

01:34:18.152 --> 01:34:20.221
ALL STATE AGENCIES, NOT JUST

01:34:20.287 --> 01:34:21.489
STATE PARKS. SO STATE PARKS WILL

01:34:21.555 --> 01:34:24.091
GO UP TO A MILLION, AND DGS

01:34:24.158 --> 01:34:25.159
WOULD GO UP TO 750,000. UNDER

01:34:25.226 --> 01:34:29.163
THE TERMS OF OUR NEGOTIATED

01:34:29.230 --> 01:34:30.064
SETTLEMENT. AND IN THE SEVEN

01:34:30.131 --> 01:34:33.200
YEAR SUNSET FOR ALL STATE

01:34:33.267 --> 01:34:34.435
AGENCIES, THOUGH NOT JUST STATE

01:34:34.502 --> 01:34:36.303
PARKS, EFFECTIVELY, YES, IT'S A

01:34:36.370 --> 01:34:39.140
YES, THOUGH AGAIN, IT'S MORE

01:34:39.206 --> 01:34:43.210
GENEROUS TO STATE PARKS. BUT BUT

01:34:43.277 --> 01:34:47.081
AGAIN, THE MEDIAN DGS REVIEWED

01:34:47.148 --> 01:34:51.852
THEIR THEIR PAST FIVE YEARS OF

01:34:51.919 --> 01:34:53.320
APPRAISAL REVIEW DATA. AND THEY

01:34:53.387 --> 01:34:56.223
FOUND THAT THE MEDIAN WAS ABOUT

01:34:56.290 --> 01:34:58.893
$1 MILLION. SO WE FOUND THAT

01:34:58.959 --> 01:35:00.461
THERE'S A MASSIVE KIND OF

01:35:00.528 --> 01:35:03.030
STATEWIDE PROBLEM. NOW DGS WOULD

01:35:03.097 --> 01:35:04.165
STILL MAINTAIN ITS WAIVER

01:35:04.231 --> 01:35:05.366
AUTHORITY. SO IT WOULD ONLY

01:35:05.433 --> 01:35:06.567
GRANT IT FOR DEPARTMENTS THAT

01:35:06.634 --> 01:35:09.470
HAD MET THE REQUISITE, YOU KNOW,

01:35:09.537 --> 01:35:11.672
EXPERIENCE FOR THE SIMPLICITY OR

01:35:11.739 --> 01:35:13.007
COMPLEXITY OF THE ACQUISITION.

01:35:13.074 --> 01:35:15.509
SO DGS COULD STILL REVIEW ANY

01:35:15.576 --> 01:35:17.878
PROJECT UNDER THE UNDER 750,000

01:35:17.945 --> 01:35:19.547
IF THEY WANTED TO. BUT IT JUST

01:35:19.613 --> 01:35:21.015
GIVES THEM THE ABILITY TO TAKE A

01:35:21.082 --> 01:35:23.517
LOOK AT THE PROJECT AND SAY,

01:35:23.584 --> 01:35:24.318
WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO GO

01:35:24.385 --> 01:35:26.320
THROUGH THE LENGTHY REVIEW FOR

01:35:26.387 --> 01:35:27.455
THESE SMALLER PROJECTS. AND JUST

01:35:27.521 --> 01:35:28.889
FOR CLARITY ON MY PART, DO THESE

01:35:28.956 --> 01:35:30.624
STATE AGENCIES, DO THEY HAVE A

01:35:30.691 --> 01:35:32.460
CAP ON WHAT THEY'RE ALLOWED TO?

01:35:32.526 --> 01:35:35.596
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, COULD CARB

01:35:35.663 --> 01:35:39.667
FIND TI¾N PROPERTIES AT $400,000

01:35:39.733 --> 01:35:41.335
APIECE AND SPEND $4 MILLION WITH

01:35:41.402 --> 01:35:43.737
JUST DGS REVIEW? YEAH, I DON'T

01:35:43.804 --> 01:35:45.639
THINK CARB'S IN THE LAND

01:35:45.706 --> 01:35:46.874
ACQUISITION BUSINESS, BUT BUT

01:35:46.941 --> 01:35:48.676
BUT I, I MEAN, I GUESS IF THEY

01:35:48.742 --> 01:35:50.277
WERE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT I'M

01:35:50.344 --> 01:35:51.479
JUST LOOKING AT IT FROM, FROM

01:35:51.545 --> 01:35:53.414
ALL SIDES, I GUESS TECHNICALLY,

01:35:53.481 --> 01:35:55.049
I MEAN YOU COULD IF THEY WERE

01:35:55.116 --> 01:35:56.250
ALL SEPARATE PURCHASES AGAIN,

01:35:56.317 --> 01:35:58.552
DGS WOULD WOULD TAKE AN INITIAL

01:35:58.619 --> 01:35:59.186
REVIEW OF EACH OF THOSE

01:35:59.253 --> 01:36:02.022
PURCHASES. DGS WOULD STILL, YOU

01:36:02.089 --> 01:36:04.925
KNOW, DO AN INITIAL REVIEW, BUT

01:36:04.992 --> 01:36:06.293
THIS, THIS, THIS WOULD PROVIDE

01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:08.162
THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO,

01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:09.630
TO, TO NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH

01:36:09.697 --> 01:36:11.398
THAT. THE TRIGGER THE MORE

01:36:11.465 --> 01:36:13.901
LENGTHY REVIEW. YEAH. AND I

01:36:13.968 --> 01:36:15.136
UNDERSTAND ON THAT PART I JUST

01:36:15.202 --> 01:36:17.138
HAVE I HAVE CONCERNS WITH A LOT

01:36:17.204 --> 01:36:19.173
OF THE AND I UNDERSTAND ON THE

01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:20.241
STATE PARK SIDE TOO. IT'S JUST

01:36:20.307 --> 01:36:23.244
THE DIFFERENCES FOR ALL AGENCIES

01:36:23.310 --> 01:36:25.045
FOR THAT. I JUST HAVE SOME

01:36:25.112 --> 01:36:25.646
CONCERNS THERE, ESPECIALLY ON

01:36:25.713 --> 01:36:27.181
THE FISCAL SIDE OF THINGS. SO

01:36:27.248 --> 01:36:29.717
THE REASON WHY, THE WAY IT KIND

01:36:29.783 --> 01:36:31.018
OF GOT IN ON THE FISCAL SIDE OF

01:36:31.085 --> 01:36:32.987
THINGS, REMEMBER, THE REVIEW WE

01:36:33.053 --> 01:36:35.256
FOUND SOMETIMES COSTS UP TO

01:36:35.322 --> 01:36:37.258
$100,000 FOR A $200,000

01:36:37.324 --> 01:36:39.460
PURCHASE. SO THAT'S THAT'S A

01:36:39.527 --> 01:36:41.262
WILD PROBLEM WE HAVE. AND THE

01:36:41.328 --> 01:36:43.264
REASON WHY WE GOT WE ENDED UP

01:36:43.330 --> 01:36:45.299
EXPANDING IT OUT IS BECAUSE WE

01:36:45.366 --> 01:36:46.200
FOUND EVEN THOUGH WE STARTED

01:36:46.267 --> 01:36:47.301
THIS OUT WITH THE PARKS

01:36:47.368 --> 01:36:48.502
CONVERSATION, IS THAT THE

01:36:48.569 --> 01:36:50.137
BACKLOG OF DGS IN GENERAL HAS

01:36:50.204 --> 01:36:52.339
CREATED MASSIVE PROBLEMS FOR

01:36:52.406 --> 01:36:54.575
PARKS SO THAT IF WE CAN LOWER

01:36:54.642 --> 01:36:57.344
THEIR BACKLOG FOR THE LARGER

01:36:57.411 --> 01:36:58.445
PURCHASES, THAT WILL STILL BE

01:36:58.512 --> 01:36:59.914
SUBJECT TO THE ROBUST REVIEW.

01:36:59.980 --> 01:37:02.750
OVER $1 MILLION AT PARKS, THOSE

01:37:02.816 --> 01:37:04.118
WILL HOPEFULLY GET SPED UP AS A

01:37:04.185 --> 01:37:06.220
RESULT OF GIVING MORE

01:37:06.287 --> 01:37:07.254
FLEXIBILITY FOR THESE SMALLER

01:37:07.321 --> 01:37:10.424
PURCHASES. I UNDERSTAND THAT

01:37:10.491 --> 01:37:13.294
PART. IT'S THERE'S YOU KNOW,

01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:14.662
THERE'S BEEN SOME SOME ISSUES

01:37:14.728 --> 01:37:16.096
WITH LIKE HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:37:16.163 --> 01:37:17.498
AUTHORITY WHEN THEY HAVE SOME

01:37:17.565 --> 01:37:18.899
ACQUISITION, THEY DON'T HAVE AS

01:37:18.966 --> 01:37:20.467
MANY BARRIERS IN PLACE. AND

01:37:20.534 --> 01:37:22.503
THAT'S WHAT THE GOAL OF THIS

01:37:22.570 --> 01:37:23.437
BILL IS TO ACTUALLY EXPEDITE. SO

01:37:23.504 --> 01:37:25.506
THAT WAY WE'RE NOT CAUGHT UP IN

01:37:25.573 --> 01:37:26.607
THAT LONG PROCESS THAT ACTUALLY

01:37:26.674 --> 01:37:28.008
COSTS MORE JUST FROM THE LABOR

01:37:28.075 --> 01:37:30.010
SIDE JUST TO GET IT DONE. BUT

01:37:30.077 --> 01:37:32.446
SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE

01:37:32.513 --> 01:37:33.047
SEEN WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL IS

01:37:33.113 --> 01:37:34.181
THAT THERE WASN'T AN ADDITIONAL

01:37:34.248 --> 01:37:36.283
OVERSIGHT TO MAKE SURE PART OF

01:37:36.350 --> 01:37:37.051
THE REVIEW, OR EVEN SOME PIECES

01:37:37.117 --> 01:37:39.353
IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE

01:37:39.420 --> 01:37:41.388
WAS AN ACTUAL FISCAL PLAN, WHICH

01:37:41.455 --> 01:37:42.022
ACTUALLY WE ALL JUST VOTED ON

01:37:42.089 --> 01:37:43.390
YESTERDAY IN PLACE FOR HIGH

01:37:43.457 --> 01:37:44.992
SPEED RAIL TO GET TO THOSE

01:37:45.059 --> 01:37:46.327
POINTS. AND SO IT'S JUST

01:37:46.393 --> 01:37:47.361
CONCERNS ON THAT PART. I

01:37:47.428 --> 01:37:47.928
COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND,

01:37:47.995 --> 01:37:49.964
ESPECIALLY THE GOAL AND MORE ON

01:37:50.030 --> 01:37:51.632
THE STATE PARKS PORTION OF IT.

01:37:51.699 --> 01:37:53.834
IT'S MORE OF THE OTHER AGENCIES

01:37:53.901 --> 01:37:55.469
THAT PART AND SOME OF THE

01:37:55.536 --> 01:37:58.906
WAIVERS I THINK ALLOWS LESS

01:37:58.973 --> 01:38:00.507
OVERSIGHT ON THAT, ESPECIALLY

01:38:00.574 --> 01:38:02.576
JUST MOVING INTO MORE OF A

01:38:02.643 --> 01:38:04.612
FISCALLY TROUBLING TIMES FOR THE

01:38:04.678 --> 01:38:06.447
FUTURE OUTCAST. SO THANK YOU.

01:38:06.513 --> 01:38:07.915
YEAH, YEAH. I MEAN, THERE'S

01:38:07.982 --> 01:38:09.283
PLENTY TO CRITICIZE ABOUT HIGH

01:38:09.350 --> 01:38:10.784
SPEED RAIL OF COURSE, BUT BUT

01:38:10.851 --> 01:38:13.087
THERE'S A THAT'S A THAT WAS A

01:38:13.153 --> 01:38:14.221
KIND OF A MACRO DECISION MADE

01:38:14.288 --> 01:38:17.258
FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE. YOU

01:38:17.324 --> 01:38:19.727
KNOW, AND LOTS OF THOSE

01:38:19.793 --> 01:38:21.195
PURCHASES HAPPEN REGARDLESS OF

01:38:21.262 --> 01:38:22.997
THE ADEQUACY OF THE FISCAL

01:38:23.063 --> 01:38:26.200
REVIEW. SO HERE WE'RE TALKING

01:38:26.267 --> 01:38:28.669
ABOUT ABOUT KIND OF SMALLER

01:38:28.736 --> 01:38:39.246
STANDALONE. PURCHASES. SO. YEAH.

01:38:39.313 --> 01:38:41.815
ASSEMBLYMEMBER ALVAREZ, THANK

01:38:41.882 --> 01:38:43.384
YOU. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK

01:38:43.450 --> 01:38:45.386
ON THIS. I THINK IT'S THERE'S A

01:38:45.452 --> 01:38:47.488
LOT OF MERIT TO THIS PROPOSAL.

01:38:47.554 --> 01:38:48.822
I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

01:38:48.889 --> 01:38:53.827
FROM THE ANALYSIS, THE. THE

01:38:53.894 --> 01:38:58.632
AMOUNTS WILL BE LIMITED TO YOU

01:38:58.699 --> 01:39:03.370
HAD MENTIONED 750,000 FOR DGS

01:39:03.437 --> 01:39:06.607
AND A MILLION FOR PARKS. IS THAT

01:39:06.674 --> 01:39:07.975
CORRECT? THAT'S CORRECT. YEAH.

01:39:08.042 --> 01:39:12.479
OKAY. THOSE ARE JUST FOR THOSE

01:39:12.546 --> 01:39:14.481
ARE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT

01:39:14.548 --> 01:39:16.550
WILL TAKE PLACE AFTER THIS

01:39:16.617 --> 01:39:17.384
COMMITTEE. OH THANK YOU. YOU

01:39:17.451 --> 01:39:19.186
HAVE CONFUSION. THAT'S WHY OKAY

01:39:19.253 --> 01:39:23.390
I, I APPRECIATE THAT OKAY. SO

01:39:23.457 --> 01:39:27.461
THERE ARE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO

01:39:27.528 --> 01:39:29.763
REDUCE THAT THEN MADAM CHAIR THE

01:39:29.830 --> 01:39:31.865
PROPOSED AMENDMENT IS TO REDUCE

01:39:31.932 --> 01:39:33.567
THAT TO 500,000. SO FOR NON

01:39:33.634 --> 01:39:35.869
STATE PROPERTY NON PARK

01:39:35.936 --> 01:39:38.539
PROPERTIES IT'S 750,000. THE

01:39:38.605 --> 01:39:40.507
THRESHOLD FOR PARK PROPERTIES IS

01:39:40.574 --> 01:39:43.610
STILL A MILLION OKAY. THANK YOU.

ON THE POTENTIAL

01:39:49.817 --> 01:39:52.286
WELL-INTENTIONED MISUSE OF THE

KNOW, MY WIFE AND I LIKE TO CALL

ZIGGY'S LAW BECAUSE IT'S AT

01:43:47.421 --> 01:43:49.856
LEAST PARTIALLY INSPIRED BY MY

01:43:49.923 --> 01:43:51.058
FATHER IN LAW, WHO WE SADLY LOST

01:43:51.124 --> 01:43:54.528
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, WHO SPENT

01:43:54.595 --> 01:43:56.029
SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF HIS LIFE

01:43:56.096 --> 01:44:01.101
IN DEEP POVERTY. AND. RELIED ON

01:44:01.168 --> 01:44:03.570
SUBSISTENCE HUNTING AND FISHING

01:44:03.637 --> 01:44:05.439
TO FEED HIMSELF AND HIS AND HIS

01:44:05.505 --> 01:44:08.275
DAUGHTERS AT CERTAIN POINTS IN

01:44:08.342 --> 01:44:11.078
HIS LIFE. YOU KNOW, A LOT OF

01:44:11.144 --> 01:44:12.212
PEOPLE THINK OF HUNTING AND

01:44:12.279 --> 01:44:14.615
FISHING AS A AS A SPORT. AND

01:44:14.681 --> 01:44:16.216
CERTAINLY LOTS OF PEOPLE GET

01:44:16.283 --> 01:44:18.018
GREAT ENJOYMENT OUT OF THOSE

01:44:18.085 --> 01:44:20.887
EXPERIENCES. BUT BUT IT ALSO IS

01:44:20.954 --> 01:44:22.422
A VERY MEANINGFUL AND IMPORTANT

01:44:22.489 --> 01:44:24.024
SOURCE OF FOOD FOR, FOR A LOT OF

01:44:24.091 --> 01:44:27.027
PEOPLE AROUND OUR COUNTRY. IT'S

01:44:27.094 --> 01:44:30.230
ONE OF THOSE AGE OLD PRACTICE

01:44:30.297 --> 01:44:32.032
BACK TO THE DAWN OF TIME, AND

01:44:32.099 --> 01:44:33.233
CERTAINLY IT'S A PHENOMENON IN

01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:35.002
OUR STATE. WE'VE GOT A LOT OF

01:44:35.068 --> 01:44:36.336
VERY LOW RESOURCE FOLKS,

01:44:36.403 --> 01:44:37.371
ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS, WHO

01:44:37.437 --> 01:44:40.674
RELY ON HUNTING AND FISHING. AND

01:44:40.741 --> 01:44:43.243
THIS BILL BASICALLY REDUCES THE

01:44:43.310 --> 01:44:47.414
COSTS OF LICENSES FOR FOLKS WITH

01:44:47.481 --> 01:44:49.716
VERY LITTLE RESOURCES SO AS TO

01:44:49.783 --> 01:44:53.320
GIVE THEM ACCESS TO THIS KIND OF

01:44:53.387 --> 01:44:54.888
TO, TO HUNTING AND FISHING IN A

01:44:54.955 --> 01:44:56.556
WAY THAT'S BOTH RESPONSIBLE. WE

01:44:56.623 --> 01:44:57.924
WANT THEM TO COMPLY WITH THE

01:44:57.991 --> 01:45:00.227
LAW, WE WANT THEM TO WORK WITH

01:45:00.293 --> 01:45:01.194
THE DEPARTMENT, BUT WE ALSO WANT

01:45:01.261 --> 01:45:03.463
TO MAKE SURE IT'S AFFORDABLE TO

01:45:03.530 --> 01:45:04.131
THEM. AND WE WANT TO RECOGNIZE

01:45:04.197 --> 01:45:06.133
THE FACT THAT THESE ARE FOLKS

01:45:06.199 --> 01:45:09.436
WITH VERY FEW RESOURCES. SO I

01:45:09.503 --> 01:45:10.570
APPROACHED SENATOR DAWLEY AND WE

01:45:10.637 --> 01:45:11.605

TOGETHER. IT'S BEEN A FUN

01:45:13.540 --> 01:45:15.042
EXPERIENCE, AND I'M HOPEFUL THIS

01:45:15.108 --> 01:45:17.477
WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR

01:45:17.544 --> 01:45:18.645
FOLKS, ESPECIALLY IN OUR IN

01:45:18.712 --> 01:45:20.280
RURAL PARTS OF OUR STATE WHO

01:45:20.347 --> 01:45:21.948
RELY ON HUNTING AND FISHING FOR

01:45:22.015 --> 01:45:23.050
SUBSISTENCE. AND THAT WILL MAKE

01:45:23.116 --> 01:45:24.418
A DIFFERENCE FOR THEM. AND WITH

01:45:24.484 --> 01:45:27.020

OPPOSITION? WITH THAT? I'LL

BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE.

01:55:59.018 --> 01:56:06.125
THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR. THIS

01:56:06.192 --> 01:56:08.227
SPECIFICALLY IMPACTS MY DISTRICT

01:56:08.294 --> 01:56:12.031
WITH THE SALTON SEA. AND I SEE

01:56:12.098 --> 01:56:13.733
THAT THERE'S AN ORGANIZATION IN

01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:16.869
IN SUPPORT HERE. LET ME JUST

01:56:16.936 --> 01:56:20.139
CLARIFY WHAT WHAT THIS ALSO

01:56:20.206 --> 01:56:21.908
MEANS, RIGHT. PEOPLE THINK THIS

01:56:21.974 --> 01:56:24.777
IS ABOUT BIRDS AND PLANTS.

01:56:24.844 --> 01:56:27.347
RIGHT. AND IT'S THE END OF THE

01:56:27.413 --> 01:56:28.548
CONVERSATION. BUT THE REALITY

01:56:28.614 --> 01:56:30.483
IS, IS IN THE SALTON SEA REGION

01:56:30.550 --> 01:56:33.119
WITH THE EXPOSED PLAYA, WHEN WE

01:56:33.186 --> 01:56:35.288
CONSERVE THAT REGION, WE ARE

01:56:35.355 --> 01:56:38.091
ACTUALLY IMPACTING THE AIR, THE

01:56:38.157 --> 01:56:39.592
QUALITY OF AIR THAT WE BREATHE

01:56:39.659 --> 01:56:43.162
IN. SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT,

01:56:43.229 --> 01:56:44.364
YOU KNOW, FOLKS WHO ARE WATCHING

01:56:44.430 --> 01:56:46.032
AND LISTENING THAT, YOU KNOW,

01:56:46.099 --> 01:56:47.333
MIGHT BE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS,

01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:49.068
THAT THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT, IF

01:56:49.135 --> 01:56:51.537
YOU WILL, A BIRD AND A PLANT.

01:56:51.604 --> 01:56:53.973
THIS IS ABOUT A WHOLE ECOSYSTEM,

01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:58.211
US INCLUDED INSIDE OF THIS. SO

01:56:58.277 --> 01:57:01.914
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. RECENTLY

01:57:01.981 --> 01:57:08.721
I WAS WITH THE NATURAL. WITH

01:57:08.788 --> 01:57:10.790
WADE CROWFOOT. GOSH, I CAN'T

01:57:10.857 --> 01:57:12.592
REMEMBER HIS TITLE NATURAL

01:57:12.658 --> 01:57:14.560
RESOURCES BOARD. SORRY. AND WE

01:57:14.627 --> 01:57:17.663
WERE AT THE SALTON SEA AND WATER

01:57:17.730 --> 01:57:19.198
WAS RELEASED INTO A SPECIFIC

01:57:19.265 --> 01:57:23.136
REGION. AND FOR YEARS PEOPLE

01:57:23.202 --> 01:57:24.470
THOUGHT, WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN?

01:57:24.537 --> 01:57:27.473
YOU KNOW, THIS IS KIND OF IT'S A

01:57:27.540 --> 01:57:28.341
DYING AREA AND THEY'VE JUST LET

01:57:28.408 --> 01:57:33.179
IT GO. WHEN WATER WAS RELEASED A

01:57:33.246 --> 01:57:36.482
FEW SHORT DAYS AFTER BIRDS

01:57:36.549 --> 01:57:40.319
STARTED COMING AND NESTING.

01:57:40.386 --> 01:57:42.588
LOOK, I'M A MARINE. I'M A TOUGH

01:57:42.655 --> 01:57:46.926
GUY. BUT I WAS LIKE, CRYING

01:57:46.993 --> 01:57:49.395
BECAUSE THIS WAS JUST A GROUP OF

01:57:49.462 --> 01:57:52.732
PEOPLE COMING TOGETHER NOT ONLY

01:57:52.799 --> 01:57:55.868
TO SAVE A REGION, BUT TO SAVE,

01:57:55.935 --> 01:57:58.171
YOU KNOW, KIDS WHO ARE BREATHING

01:57:58.237 --> 01:58:00.606
IN BAD AIR BECAUSE OF WHAT'S

01:58:00.673 --> 01:58:03.443
GOING ON. SO I THANK THE AUTHOR

01:58:03.509 --> 01:58:04.444
FOR THIS. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU

01:58:04.510 --> 01:58:06.212
WERE LOOKING AT ME LIKE, OH MY

01:58:06.279 --> 01:58:08.147
GOSH, SHE'S GOING TO HE'S GOING

01:58:08.214 --> 01:58:10.016
TO OPPOSE THIS. I'M IN GREAT

01:58:10.082 --> 01:58:11.851
SUPPORT OF THIS BECAUSE OF THE

01:58:11.918 --> 01:58:15.621
DIRECT IMPACT THAT I GET TO SEE.

01:58:15.688 --> 01:58:17.123
SPECIFICALLY A COUPLE MILES DOWN

01:58:17.190 --> 01:58:19.959
FROM MY HOUSE. SO WITH THAT, I'M

01:58:20.026 --> 01:58:21.861
IN FULL SUPPORT OF THAT AND I

01:58:21.928 --> 01:58:26.399
ASK TO BE A COAUTHOR. THANK YOU.

01:58:26.466 --> 01:58:27.500
THANK YOU, VICE CHAIR. ANY OTHER

01:58:27.567 --> 01:58:30.770
MEMBERS? I BELIEVE WE HAD A

01:58:30.837 --> 01:58:34.006
MOTION AND A SECOND ALREADY.

01:58:34.073 --> 01:58:35.475
THANK YOU SO MUCH TO THE AUTHOR

01:58:35.541 --> 01:58:37.343
FOR MAKING SURE THAT THIS

01:58:37.410 --> 01:58:40.246
FUNDING STAYS ALIVE. I DON'T

01:58:40.313 --> 01:58:42.548
KNOW IF YOU LEARNED, BUT

01:58:42.615 --> 01:58:43.216
CERTAINLY I'VE LEARNED THAT

01:58:43.282 --> 01:58:45.017
THERE'S A LOT OF MOVING AROUND

01:58:45.084 --> 01:58:46.686
OF FUNDS, AND ONCE THEY GET

01:58:46.752 --> 01:58:47.954
DESIGNATED, PRESERVING THEM

01:58:48.020 --> 01:58:50.056
REALLY IS THE KEY. SO I, I THANK

01:58:50.122 --> 01:58:51.958
YOU FOR YOUR SAVVY IN BRINGING

01:58:52.024 --> 01:58:53.059
THIS FORWARD. WOULD YOU LIKE TO

01:58:53.125 --> 01:58:54.427
CLOSE? YES. THANK YOU. YES, I

01:58:54.494 --> 01:58:56.329
APPRECIATE THAT. AND I VERY MUCH

01:58:56.395 --> 01:58:57.296
APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY FROM

01:58:57.363 --> 01:58:58.431
ASSEMBLYMEMBER GONZALEZ ABOUT

01:58:58.498 --> 01:59:00.867
HIS PERSONAL EMOTIONAL

01:59:00.933 --> 01:59:02.602
EXPERIENCE OF SEEING BASICALLY

01:59:02.668 --> 01:59:04.871
HABITAT COME BACK TO LIFE. IT'S

01:59:04.937 --> 01:59:06.339
IMPORTANT TO CONTEXTUALIZE THIS.

01:59:06.405 --> 01:59:08.508
SO IT'S ONLY $30 MILLION, BUT

01:59:08.574 --> 01:59:10.309
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY WHEN IT

01:59:10.376 --> 01:59:12.545
CAN BE LEVERAGED AGAINST OTHER

01:59:12.612 --> 01:59:15.448
GRANTS AND PRIVATE PHILANTHROPIC

01:59:15.515 --> 01:59:16.816
COMMITMENTS. AND ALL OF THE

01:59:16.883 --> 01:59:17.917
SUPPORTERS THAT WE HAD TODAY,

01:59:17.984 --> 01:59:19.352
ALL THOSE ORGANIZATIONS AND THE

01:59:19.418 --> 01:59:21.854
WORK THEY DO, AND THIS MONEY

01:59:21.921 --> 01:59:24.023
CAME PERILOUSLY CLOSE TO BEING

01:59:24.090 --> 01:59:25.925
SWEPT LAST YEAR, AND THE NUMBER

01:59:25.992 --> 01:59:27.927
OF LEGISLATORS WHO HAD IT ON

01:59:27.994 --> 01:59:30.162
THEIR RADAR WAS VERY, VERY FEW,

01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:31.197
BECAUSE THINGS ARE MOVING AROUND

01:59:31.264 --> 01:59:34.066
REALLY QUICKLY. AND MANY OF US

01:59:34.133 --> 01:59:35.902
ARE INVOLVED IN A LOT OF

01:59:35.968 --> 01:59:37.003
DIFFERENT FIGHTS. AND SO, YOU

01:59:37.069 --> 01:59:38.237
KNOW, IF IT WASN'T FOR ADVOCATES

01:59:38.304 --> 01:59:41.173
WHO RAISED IT TO A, TO THE ALARM

01:59:41.240 --> 01:59:43.009
LEVEL OF RED, TO ME, I WOULDN'T

01:59:43.075 --> 01:59:44.777
HAVE BEEN SPEAKING AGAINST IT AT

01:59:44.844 --> 01:59:46.312
THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE AND

01:59:46.379 --> 01:59:47.413
WOULDN'T HAVE REALIZED WHAT IT

01:59:47.480 --> 01:59:49.582
WAS THAT THIS PARTICULAR FUND

01:59:49.649 --> 01:59:50.950
DID. SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT,

01:59:51.017 --> 01:59:53.452
AS WE'RE DOING SO MUCH CEQA

01:59:53.519 --> 01:59:54.887
STREAMLINING AND WE'RE

01:59:54.954 --> 01:59:56.856
CONSIDERING MAJOR PROJECTS THAT

01:59:56.923 --> 01:59:59.625
WILL BE DEVELOPING IN OUR IN OUR

01:59:59.692 --> 02:00:02.161
CURRENTLY WILD AREAS THAT WE ARE

02:00:02.228 --> 02:00:04.397
PRESERVING HABITAT AND WILDLIFE

02:00:04.463 --> 02:00:06.832
AND CORRIDORS AND THE ABILITY

02:00:06.899 --> 02:00:08.601
FOR US TO HAVE ALL THE MANY

02:00:08.668 --> 02:00:09.969
CO-BENEFITS OF PROTECTING

02:00:10.036 --> 02:00:11.370
SPECIES THAT MIGHT BE AT RISK OF

02:00:11.437 --> 02:00:13.205
GOING EXTINCT AND ALSO JUST

02:00:13.272 --> 02:00:14.874
NATURAL, OPEN, WILD PLACES FOR

02:00:14.941 --> 02:00:16.442
PEOPLE TO VISIT AND FOR ANIMALS

02:00:16.509 --> 02:00:18.010
TO THRIVE AND PLANTS TO LIVE.

02:00:18.077 --> 02:00:19.412
AND ALL THE THINGS THAT WE KNOW

02:00:19.478 --> 02:00:21.547
ARE GREAT ABOUT WHAT A WILD

02:00:21.614 --> 02:00:24.884
PLACES. SO IT'S JUST I THIS IS A

02:00:24.951 --> 02:00:26.285
RELATIVELY SMALL BECAUSE IT'S

02:00:26.352 --> 02:00:27.687
EXTENDING A SUNSET BY FIVE YEARS

02:00:27.753 --> 02:00:30.856
FROM 2030 TO 2035, BUT IT DOES

02:00:30.923 --> 02:00:32.458
CLEARLY SEND THE MESSAGE THAT

02:00:32.525 --> 02:00:34.160
THE LEGISLATURE CARES ABOUT THIS

02:00:34.226 --> 02:00:35.928
AND THAT WE DO NOT. I THINK IT

02:00:35.995 --> 02:00:37.463
SAYS WE DO NOT WANT THIS SWEPT

02:00:37.530 --> 02:00:39.432
IN FUTURE YEARS, BECAUSE IT HAS

02:00:39.498 --> 02:00:40.199
GONE THROUGH A LEGISLATIVE

02:00:40.266 --> 02:00:41.867
PROCESS AND WE'VE ESTABLISHED IT

02:00:41.934 --> 02:00:43.469
AS A PRIORITY. SO I'M GRATEFUL

02:00:43.536 --> 02:00:44.637
FOR THE SUPPORT OF THIS

02:00:44.704 --> 02:00:46.005
COMMITTEE. AND I THINK, YOU

02:00:46.072 --> 02:00:47.373
KNOW, WE ALL NEED TO BE VIGILANT

02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:48.908
ABOUT FUNDING STREAMS LIKE THIS,

02:00:48.975 --> 02:00:50.676
AS YOU SAID, CHAIR, TO MAKE SURE

02:00:50.743 --> 02:00:53.245
THAT THEY RETAIN BECAUSE THEY

02:00:53.312 --> 02:00:55.615
THEY VERY MUCH CAN BE THREATENED

02:00:55.681 --> 02:00:58.250
IF WE DON'T PROTECT THEM.

02:00:58.317 --> 02:00:59.118
EXCELLENT. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

02:00:59.185 --> 02:01:01.287
WITH THAT, WE'LL TAKE A VOTE.

02:01:01.354 --> 02:01:02.221

LEAVE IT OPEN FOR ADDITIONAL ADD

ONS. ADDITIONAL ADD ONS. I THINK

02:01:35.588 --> 02:01:37.223
THAT'S A LITTLE REPETITIVE.

02:01:37.289 --> 02:01:40.126
OKAY, SENATOR JONES, COME ON

COMMITTEE STAFF REALLY DID THIS.
