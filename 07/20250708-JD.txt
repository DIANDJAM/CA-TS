WELL, GOOD

COMPLETE OUR AGENDA, ALLOW

EVERYONE EQUAL TIME, THE RULES

00:32:27.278 --> 00:32:28.112
OF WITNESS TESTIMONY ARE THAT

00:32:28.179 --> 00:32:29.547
EACH SIDE WILL BE ALLOWED TWO

00:32:29.614 --> 00:32:30.448
MAIN WITNESSES. EACH WITNESSES

00:32:30.515 --> 00:32:31.883

00:32:31.949 --> 00:32:32.583
MINUTES TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:34.652
OR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL, AND

00:32:34.719 --> 00:32:35.386
ADDITIONAL WITNESSES SHOULD

00:32:35.453 --> 00:32:36.854
STATE ONLY THEIR NAMES OR

00:32:36.921 --> 00:32:37.955
ORGANIZATION, IF ANY, AND THEIR

00:32:38.022 --> 00:32:39.624
POSITION ON THE BILL. AND AS WE

00:32:39.691 --> 00:32:40.858
PROCEED WITH WITNESS AND PUBLIC

00:32:40.925 --> 00:32:42.527
COMMENT, I WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:32:42.593 --> 00:32:43.294
EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE

00:32:43.361 --> 00:32:44.729
COMMITTEE HAS RULES TO ENSURE A

00:32:44.796 --> 00:32:47.598
FAIR AND EFFICIENT HEARING, AND

00:32:47.665 --> 00:32:49.033
I WON'T GO OVER ALL THOSE

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:50.435
DETAILS AT THE MOMENT, BUT

00:32:50.501 --> 00:32:52.003
HOPEFULLY THOSE WON'T BE

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:53.771
NECESSARY SINCE WE HAVE A VERY

00:32:53.838 --> 00:32:55.740
WELL-BEHAVED AUDIENCE AND, I

00:32:55.807 --> 00:32:57.909
HOPE, WELL-BEHAVED SENATE

00:32:57.975 --> 00:33:03.081
AUTHORS. FOR THE OTHERS. AND SO

00:33:03.147 --> 00:33:05.216
WE DO NOT HAVE A QUORUM.

00:33:05.283 --> 00:33:07.385
HOWEVER, WE WILL BEGIN AS A

00:33:07.452 --> 00:33:09.153
SUBCOMMITTEE IN ORDER TO RESPECT

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:11.422
THE TIME OF EVERYONE THAT'S HERE

00:33:11.489 --> 00:33:13.124
THIS MORNING. AND SO WE'LL GO

00:33:13.191 --> 00:33:14.926
AHEAD AND START WITH SENATOR

00:33:14.992 --> 00:33:17.295
LAIRD. AND WILL YOU BE STARTING

00:33:17.362 --> 00:33:23.368
WITH ITEM ONE, SB 29. JUST ME?

00:33:23.434 --> 00:33:28.272
YEAH, THIS IS TWO OF US AGAIN.

00:33:28.339 --> 00:33:30.808
ALL RIGHT. WE'LL HANDLE IT.

00:33:30.875 --> 00:33:39.417
YEAH. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING.

00:33:39.484 --> 00:33:41.319
AND WHENEVER YOU'RE READY, SIR.

00:33:41.386 --> 00:33:45.189
THANK YOU. AND I KNOW I HAVE

00:33:45.256 --> 00:33:46.591
ANOTHER BILL, AND I'M PRESENTING

00:33:46.657 --> 00:33:47.759
A BILL FOR SENATOR. THAT'S

00:33:47.825 --> 00:33:49.360
CORRECT. FOR SENATOR REYES. YES.

00:33:49.427 --> 00:33:51.329
YOU CAN DO ALL THREE OF THOSE

00:33:51.396 --> 00:33:52.997
RIGHT NOW SINCE YOU'RE THE

00:33:53.064 --> 00:33:55.032
PROMPT, SENATOR, THIS MORNING.

00:33:55.099 --> 00:33:58.202
BLESS YOU. SO I AM HERE, AS YOU

00:33:58.269 --> 00:34:01.839
SAID, TO PRESENT SENATE BILL 29.

00:34:01.906 --> 00:34:04.609
THIS BILL WAS NARROWED IN THE

00:34:04.675 --> 00:34:06.411
SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE

00:34:06.477 --> 00:34:09.680
TO TAKE A SUNSET AND TO COMPILE

00:34:09.747 --> 00:34:11.449
INFORMATION ON THE NUMBER OF

00:34:11.516 --> 00:34:15.953
CASES THAT THAT ARE INVOLVED IN

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:18.623
2021, I AUTHORED SENATE BILL

00:34:18.689 --> 00:34:20.825
447. AT THE TIME, CALIFORNIA WAS

00:34:20.892 --> 00:34:23.294
ONE OF FIVE STATES IN THE UNITED

00:34:23.361 --> 00:34:24.929
STATES WHERE IF YOU WERE

00:34:24.996 --> 00:34:28.399
ENTITLED TO A PAIN AND SUFFERING

00:34:28.466 --> 00:34:32.069
ACTION, IT DIED WITH YOU. IF YOU

00:34:32.136 --> 00:34:34.939
DIED, THERE HAS BEEN A BACKLOG.

00:34:35.006 --> 00:34:36.707
THERE'S STILL A TWO YEAR BACKLOG

00:34:36.774 --> 00:34:38.876
IN IN SOME COUNTIES. BUT AT THE

00:34:38.943 --> 00:34:40.978
TIME THERE WAS A PARTICULAR

00:34:41.045 --> 00:34:42.780
BACKLOG BECAUSE OF COVID. AND

00:34:42.847 --> 00:34:44.949
THERE WERE MANY, MANY CASES

00:34:45.016 --> 00:34:47.251
WHERE PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO JUST

00:34:47.318 --> 00:34:49.320
OUTWAIT THE PERSON THAT HAD THE

00:34:49.387 --> 00:34:51.322
ACTION AND THEY DIED WITHOUT

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:55.092
GETTING REDRESS. WHEN THIS BILL

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:58.129
WAS ENACTED IN 2021, IT MEANT

00:34:58.196 --> 00:35:00.398
THAT CALIFORNIA WAS JUST ONE OF

00:35:00.465 --> 00:35:03.301
FOUR STATES WHERE THAT WAS THE

00:35:03.367 --> 00:35:08.673
CASE, AND MANY VICTIMS,

00:35:08.739 --> 00:35:10.808
INCLUDING VICTIMS OF ASBESTOS

00:35:10.875 --> 00:35:13.344
POISONING, ELDER ABUSE, LOW WAGE

00:35:13.411 --> 00:35:15.980
WORKERS WERE THOSE THAT EITHER

00:35:16.047 --> 00:35:17.682
MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD THE RESOURCES

00:35:17.748 --> 00:35:19.116
OR MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD THE

00:35:19.183 --> 00:35:21.385
ADEQUATE REPRESENTATION, AND AS

00:35:21.452 --> 00:35:24.489
A RESULT, LOST THE BENEFIT AND

00:35:24.555 --> 00:35:27.625
PEOPLE WOULD NOT BE INCLINED TO

00:35:27.692 --> 00:35:28.926
SETTLE BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THEY

00:35:28.993 --> 00:35:31.762
COULD OUTWAIT THIS SITUATION.

00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:34.232
AND IT IS THOSE REPRESENTATIONS

00:35:34.298 --> 00:35:36.701
OF WORKERS AND ASBESTOS AND

00:35:36.767 --> 00:35:39.036
OTHERS. THAT'S THE REASON THE

00:35:39.103 --> 00:35:41.772
CALIFORNIA LABOR FED AND THE

00:35:41.839 --> 00:35:42.840
CALIFORNIA BUILDING TRADES,

00:35:42.907 --> 00:35:44.876
WHICH ARE HERE, THE IRONWORKERS

00:35:44.942 --> 00:35:47.879
AND OTHERS STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS

00:35:47.945 --> 00:35:49.780
BILL, AND IT'S ALSO SUPPORTED BY

00:35:49.847 --> 00:35:53.751
ELDER ADVOCATES BECAUSE OF THE

00:35:53.818 --> 00:35:57.355
CASES THERE, THE JUDICIAL

00:35:57.421 --> 00:36:00.625
COUNCIL HAS COMPILED STATISTICS

00:36:00.691 --> 00:36:04.128
SINCE THAT LAW WAS ENACTED IN

00:36:04.195 --> 00:36:05.930
2021. AND THERE HAVE BEEN

00:36:05.997 --> 00:36:08.799
EXACTLY FOUR CASES REPORTED TO

00:36:08.866 --> 00:36:12.136
THEM WHERE THAT LAW HAS BEEN

00:36:12.203 --> 00:36:15.006
USED. I DO NOT WANT TO

00:36:15.072 --> 00:36:17.041
COMPLETELY MISREPRESENT THAT,

00:36:17.108 --> 00:36:18.843
BECAUSE THERE'S A NUMBER OF

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:19.977
CASES WHERE THERE ARE

00:36:20.044 --> 00:36:21.078
SETTLEMENTS, BECAUSE NOW THERE'S

00:36:21.145 --> 00:36:23.648
NO INCENTIVE NOT TO SETTLE. SO

00:36:23.714 --> 00:36:26.217
AS OPPOSED TO PRIOR TO THE LAW,

00:36:26.284 --> 00:36:29.387
PEOPLE ARE SETTLING CASES. THE

00:36:29.453 --> 00:36:31.455
NUMBER OF SETTLEMENTS HAS NOT

00:36:31.522 --> 00:36:33.991
BEEN ADEQUATELY COMPILED. AND

00:36:34.058 --> 00:36:36.327
THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT

00:36:36.394 --> 00:36:38.296
WE TOOK THE AMENDMENT THAT SAYS

00:36:38.362 --> 00:36:41.299
THERE WILL BE INFORMATION

00:36:41.365 --> 00:36:44.201
COMPILED ON THIS, ALTHOUGH I

00:36:44.268 --> 00:36:46.604
SHOULD POINT OUT ONE OF THE

00:36:46.671 --> 00:36:48.272
INTERESTING ANOMALIES, WHICH IS

00:36:48.339 --> 00:36:49.974
THAT THERE'S BEEN A CRITICISM

00:36:50.041 --> 00:36:52.376
THAT THERE'S NOT INFORMATION WE

00:36:52.443 --> 00:36:54.579
HAVE PUT IN THE BILL A

00:36:54.645 --> 00:36:57.148
COMPILATION OF INFORMATION. AND

00:36:57.214 --> 00:37:00.351
YET SOME OF THE INTERESTS WHERE

00:37:00.418 --> 00:37:03.354
THEIR SETTLEMENTS ARE ASKED NOT

00:37:03.421 --> 00:37:06.090
TO HAVE MANDATORY REPORTING OF

00:37:06.157 --> 00:37:07.925
SETTLEMENTS BECAUSE THEY DON'T

00:37:07.992 --> 00:37:10.094
WANT IT TO APPEAR IF THEY

00:37:10.161 --> 00:37:11.128
SETTLED THAT THAT WAS AN

00:37:11.195 --> 00:37:13.731
ADMISSION OF GUILT. AND SO THE

00:37:13.798 --> 00:37:15.900
IRONY IS, IS SOME OF THE PEOPLE

00:37:15.967 --> 00:37:17.602
THAT SAY YOU DON'T HAVE

00:37:17.668 --> 00:37:18.569
STATISTICS ARE THE ONES THAT

00:37:18.636 --> 00:37:21.038
DON'T WANT TO HELP US COMPILE

00:37:21.105 --> 00:37:21.839
THE STATISTICS WITH THE

00:37:21.906 --> 00:37:27.545
AMENDMENT. SO I THINK THAT THE

00:37:27.612 --> 00:37:29.013
ADDITIONAL CASES IN WHICH

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:31.582
SETTLEMENTS WERE MADE, THE

00:37:31.649 --> 00:37:33.017
IMPACT OF THE LAW HAS BEEN

00:37:33.084 --> 00:37:34.485
REASONABLE. AND THE CALIFORNIA

00:37:34.552 --> 00:37:35.920
DEFENSE COUNSEL IS NEUTRAL ON

00:37:35.987 --> 00:37:39.390
THE BILL. SO IF WE LET THIS LAW

00:37:39.457 --> 00:37:40.524
SUNSET, CALIFORNIA, WOULD

00:37:40.591 --> 00:37:43.494
REGRESS TO BEING NOW JUST ONE OF

00:37:43.561 --> 00:37:44.395
FOUR STATES BECAUSE ANOTHER

00:37:44.462 --> 00:37:47.331
STATE'S FLIPPED SINCE WE DID THE

00:37:47.398 --> 00:37:49.900
2021 LAW WITH AN OUTDATED AND

00:37:49.967 --> 00:37:51.369
RESTRICTIVE STANDARD AND UNDOING

00:37:51.435 --> 00:37:54.205
THE PROGRESS TO PROTECT VICTIMS

00:37:54.271 --> 00:37:58.075
RIGHTS. AND THESE ARE ESPECIALLY

00:37:58.142 --> 00:37:59.210
IMPORTANT TO STAY AT HOME

00:37:59.276 --> 00:38:00.678
PARENTS, LOW INCOME WORKERS,

00:38:00.745 --> 00:38:03.180
ELDERS, CHILDREN, DISABLED,

00:38:03.247 --> 00:38:05.082
BASICALLY ANYONE WHOSE LOSSES

00:38:05.149 --> 00:38:07.418
ARE NOT PRIMARILY BASED ON THEIR

00:38:07.485 --> 00:38:11.856
INCOME. I HAVE TO CONFESS THAT

00:38:11.922 --> 00:38:14.358
IN MY 11 YEARS OF LEGISLATIVE

00:38:14.425 --> 00:38:19.063
SERVICE, OVER ALMOST 23 YEARS

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:21.399
PERIOD, I HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED

00:38:21.465 --> 00:38:23.701
THE LEVEL OF DISINFORMATION

00:38:23.768 --> 00:38:25.870
ABOUT A BILL AS THERE HAS BEEN

00:38:25.936 --> 00:38:28.873
ON THIS BILL. SO LET ME GO

00:38:28.939 --> 00:38:31.709
THROUGH A FEW OF THE ISSUES TO

00:38:31.776 --> 00:38:35.646
JUST CLARIFY. IT'S BEEN SAID

00:38:35.713 --> 00:38:38.215
THAT WITH THIS BILL, THE

00:38:38.282 --> 00:38:39.784
FLOODGATES WILL OPEN AND

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:43.220
LIABILITY COSTS WILL SKYROCKET.

00:38:43.287 --> 00:38:44.955
OBVIOUSLY, WITH THE NUMBER OF

00:38:45.022 --> 00:38:46.824
CASES BEING SO SMALL, I THINK ON

00:38:46.891 --> 00:38:50.261
ITS FACE THAT IS NOT TRUE. BUT

00:38:50.327 --> 00:38:54.031
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE, EVEN WITH

00:38:54.098 --> 00:38:57.168
THE MICRO REFORM OF 2022 AND THE

00:38:57.234 --> 00:39:00.371
CAPS RAISING A BIT ON MEDICAL

00:39:00.438 --> 00:39:02.239
MALPRACTICE, THERE'S BEEN NO

00:39:02.306 --> 00:39:04.075
EVIDENCE THAT THERE'S BEEN AN

00:39:04.141 --> 00:39:05.509
INCREASE IN MEDICAL MALPRACTICE

00:39:05.576 --> 00:39:09.380
INSURANCE RATES SINCE EITHER LAW

00:39:09.447 --> 00:39:14.952
ENACTED. I THINK THERE'S ONE

00:39:15.019 --> 00:39:18.456
SINGLE DOCTOR MALPRACTICE RATE

00:39:18.522 --> 00:39:19.423
THAT WAS FILED WITH THE

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:22.660
DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE THAT WAS

00:39:22.727 --> 00:39:25.329
17/100 OF A PERCENT OF A RATE

00:39:25.396 --> 00:39:27.098
INCREASE. BUT THERE'S REALLY NO

00:39:27.164 --> 00:39:28.566
EVIDENCE THAT THIS HAS AFFECTED

00:39:28.632 --> 00:39:30.401
THE RATES ON INSURANCE. IT'S

00:39:30.468 --> 00:39:32.103
BEEN ARGUED THAT THIS BILL IS

00:39:32.169 --> 00:39:36.841
DOUBLE DIPPING ON PUNITIVE

00:39:36.907 --> 00:39:39.410
DAMAGES IN RELATION TO PAIN AND

00:39:39.477 --> 00:39:42.113
SUFFERING. AND THERE'S SEPARATE

00:39:42.179 --> 00:39:44.148
DAMAGES FOR SEPARATE PURPOSES.

00:39:44.215 --> 00:39:49.086
THEY DON'T OVERLAP. AND FOR

00:39:49.153 --> 00:39:51.322
PUNITIVE DAMAGES YOU HAVE TO

00:39:51.388 --> 00:39:52.990
PROVE MALICE, FRAUD OR

00:39:53.057 --> 00:39:55.192
OPPRESSION, WHICH IS A HIGHER

00:39:55.259 --> 00:39:59.663
STANDARD. AND SO THERE IS NOT AN

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:01.799
EVIDENCE OF, OF DOUBLE DIPPING

00:40:01.866 --> 00:40:04.802
IN REVERSE. THERE'S BEEN CHARTS

00:40:04.869 --> 00:40:09.874
GOING AROUND THAT. YOU CAN GET

00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:11.776
WRONGFUL DEATH AND PAIN AND

00:40:11.842 --> 00:40:14.879
SUFFERING JUDGMENTS. BUT ALL

00:40:14.945 --> 00:40:17.982
THIS IS UNDER THE MICRO CAP. SO

00:40:18.048 --> 00:40:20.918
THE MICRO CAPS THAT WERE ADOPTED

00:40:20.985 --> 00:40:22.653
IN 2022 COVER THIS ON THE SENATE

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.388
FLOOR. AND THE DEBATE ONE

00:40:24.455 --> 00:40:25.756
SENATOR SAID, OH, THERE WAS A

00:40:25.823 --> 00:40:28.692
PAYMENT OF $3 MILLION. FALSE ON

00:40:28.759 --> 00:40:30.694
ITS FACE BECAUSE THE CAP RIGHT

00:40:30.761 --> 00:40:34.365
NOW IS ABOUT ONE SIXTH OF THAT.

00:40:34.431 --> 00:40:37.601
AND SO THIS ALSO PRESUMES HUMAN

00:40:37.668 --> 00:40:38.702
SUFFERING IS PART OF EVERY

00:40:38.769 --> 00:40:41.906
WRONGFUL DEATH ACTION. IT IS NOT

00:40:41.972 --> 00:40:45.276
IT'S BEEN STATED, AND THIS IS A

00:40:45.342 --> 00:40:49.513
KEY POINT, THAT THE MICRO

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:51.315
NEGOTIATIONS THAT RESULTED IN

00:40:51.382 --> 00:40:57.555
ASSEMBLY BILL 35, IN 2022. WHAT

00:40:57.621 --> 00:40:59.557
THIS WAS PART OF THAT DEAL. AND

00:40:59.623 --> 00:41:00.825
IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS

00:41:00.891 --> 00:41:02.827
WOULD SUNSET. AND EVERYBODY

00:41:02.893 --> 00:41:05.062
UNDERSTOOD THAT AS PART OF THE

00:41:05.129 --> 00:41:07.097
DEAL. THAT IS JUST PLAINLY

00:41:07.164 --> 00:41:10.167
FALSE. AND I WAS A PRINCIPAL

00:41:10.234 --> 00:41:13.904
COAUTHOR OF THAT BILL ON THE

00:41:13.971 --> 00:41:15.973
MICRO CAPS, AND I WOULD NOT HAVE

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:19.710
DONE THAT IF IT UNDID THE OTHER

00:41:19.777 --> 00:41:22.279
LAW. AND I THINK IT'S BEEN RUN

00:41:22.346 --> 00:41:23.781
TO GROUND IN THE SENATE

00:41:23.848 --> 00:41:26.150
JUDICIARY HEARING THAT IT WAS

00:41:26.217 --> 00:41:29.887
NOT INCLUDED IN THOSE

00:41:29.954 --> 00:41:34.225
NEGOTIATIONS. AND IT IS. AND

00:41:34.291 --> 00:41:36.627
THAT'S A VERY, VERY IMPORTANT

00:41:36.694 --> 00:41:40.531
POINT. AND SO NOW THE QUESTION

00:41:40.598 --> 00:41:42.199
IS, AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:41:42.266 --> 00:41:43.601
CAME UP IN THE SENATE JUDICIARY

00:41:43.667 --> 00:41:47.171
HEARING, THE CHAIR ASKED ONE OF

00:41:47.238 --> 00:41:50.674
THE WITNESSES THAT IF YOU

00:41:50.741 --> 00:41:54.979
EXEMPTED MEDICAL MALPRACTICE

00:41:55.045 --> 00:41:58.148
FROM PAIN AND SUFFERING, THAT IF

00:41:58.215 --> 00:42:02.286
YOU WERE IN A CAR ACCIDENT AND

00:42:02.353 --> 00:42:03.988
DUE TO SOMEBODY NEGLIGENCE AND

00:42:04.054 --> 00:42:05.823
YOU HAD A NEGLIGENT ACTION AND

00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:08.659
YOU HAD PAIN AND SUFFERING, WHY

00:42:08.726 --> 00:42:10.761
SHOULD IN MEDICAL MALPRACTICE

00:42:10.828 --> 00:42:13.130
SHOULD YOU HAVE AN INCIDENT AND

00:42:13.197 --> 00:42:15.032
THEN ALSO BE EXEMPTED FROM PAIN

00:42:15.099 --> 00:42:17.001
AND SUFFERING? WHY WOULD YOU SET

00:42:17.067 --> 00:42:18.369
UP A LAW THAT HAD DIFFERENT

00:42:18.435 --> 00:42:20.704
TIERS FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF

00:42:20.771 --> 00:42:22.840
WAYS? THE ACTION OCCURRED? AND I

00:42:22.907 --> 00:42:24.541
THINK THAT WAS A HARD QUESTION

00:42:24.608 --> 00:42:26.443
TO ANSWER BECAUSE THERE REALLY

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:27.645
SHOULDN'T BE. AND WHEN YOU HEAR

00:42:27.711 --> 00:42:29.546
FROM ONE OF THE WITNESSES, YOU

00:42:29.613 --> 00:42:32.182
WILL HEAR OF AN ACTUAL CASE THAT

00:42:32.249 --> 00:42:35.119
I THINK STRONGLY MAKES THE CASE

00:42:35.185 --> 00:42:37.821
FOR WHY THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE.

00:42:37.888 --> 00:42:42.259
SO THAT'S AS BRIEF AS AS I CAN

00:42:42.326 --> 00:42:44.328
MAKE IT. I KNOW THERE WILL BE AN

00:42:44.395 --> 00:42:46.530
ANIMATED DEBATE. I LOOK FORWARD

00:42:46.597 --> 00:42:48.365
TO PUSHING BACK. THIS JUST

00:42:48.432 --> 00:42:50.901
ENSURES THAT VICTIMS WHO ENDURE

00:42:50.968 --> 00:42:52.937
INTENSE PAIN AND SUFFERING ARE

00:42:53.003 --> 00:42:55.472
NOT DENIED THEIR JUSTICE BECAUSE

00:42:55.539 --> 00:42:59.476
THEY DIDN'T LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO

00:42:59.543 --> 00:43:01.645
REALIZE IT. SO WITH ME TO

00:43:01.712 --> 00:43:03.580
TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS ERICA COLE

00:43:03.647 --> 00:43:05.282

00:43:12.957 --> 00:43:15.426
TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. AND JEREMY

SMITH IS HERE WITH THE STATE

00:43:17.227 --> 00:43:18.862

00:43:18.929 --> 00:43:21.365
COUNCIL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME.

00:43:21.432 --> 00:43:23.734

NAME IS ERICA COLE, AND I'M HERE

00:43:49.593 --> 00:43:51.628
TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF MY MOM,

00:43:51.695 --> 00:43:53.931
PAMELA GRAHAM. MY MOM WAS A

00:43:53.998 --> 00:43:55.366
KIND, LOVING WOMAN WHO WAS THE

00:43:55.432 --> 00:43:57.201
HEART OF OUR FAMILY, AND SHE WAS

00:43:57.267 --> 00:43:58.969
TAKEN FROM US FAR TOO SOON DUE

00:43:59.036 --> 00:44:00.504
TO THE NEGLIGENCE OF THOSE WHO

00:44:00.571 --> 00:44:02.840
WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR HER CARE.

00:44:02.906 --> 00:44:05.809
ON NOVEMBER 4TH, 2023, MY MOM

00:44:05.876 --> 00:44:07.511
WAS RUSHED TO SCRIPPS MEMORIAL

00:44:07.578 --> 00:44:09.680
HOSPITAL AFTER TAKING A BAD FALL

00:44:09.747 --> 00:44:11.215
AND FRACTURING HER ANKLE WHILE

00:44:11.281 --> 00:44:12.883
IN THE TRAUMA UNIT. SHE WAS

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:14.718
IMMEDIATELY SEDATED AND

00:44:14.785 --> 00:44:15.853
INTUBATED AFTER HER ANKLE

00:44:15.919 --> 00:44:17.488
SURGERY. MY MOM KEPT TELLING US

00:44:17.554 --> 00:44:19.089
SOMETHING WASN'T RIGHT. SHE

00:44:19.156 --> 00:44:20.491
STRUGGLED TO BREATHE AND SAID

00:44:20.557 --> 00:44:21.959
THE BREATHING TREATMENTS WEREN'T

00:44:22.026 --> 00:44:23.727
WORKING. SHE KEPT FAILING HER

00:44:23.794 --> 00:44:25.596
SWALLOWING TEST AND FELT WEAKER

00:44:25.662 --> 00:44:28.499
AS THE DAYS WENT ON. WE WATCHED

00:44:28.565 --> 00:44:29.933
HER SUFFER AND BEGGED FOR

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.369
ANSWERS, BUT NONE CAME. SHE WAS

00:44:32.436 --> 00:44:33.537
EVENTUALLY SENT TO A SKILLED

00:44:33.604 --> 00:44:35.773
NURSING REHAB WHERE HER ISSUES

00:44:35.839 --> 00:44:37.408
CONTINUED. ON WEDNESDAY,

00:44:37.474 --> 00:44:39.309
DECEMBER 6TH, 2023, I GOT THE

00:44:39.376 --> 00:44:40.878
CALL. MY MOM WAS BEING RUSHED

00:44:40.944 --> 00:44:43.881
BACK TO THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE HER

00:44:43.947 --> 00:44:44.481
BLOOD PRESSURE HAD PLUMMETED.

00:44:44.548 --> 00:44:47.017
SHE WAS BARELY HANGING ON. SHE

00:44:47.084 --> 00:44:49.319
SUFFERED WITH ACUTE HYPOXIC

00:44:49.386 --> 00:44:51.121
RESPIRATORY FAILURE. THE ICU

00:44:51.188 --> 00:44:52.556
DOCTOR INFORMED US THAT HE

00:44:52.623 --> 00:44:54.591
NEEDED TO PUT A CAMERA INTO HER

00:44:54.658 --> 00:44:55.692
AIRWAY, AND ASKED US TO STEP

00:44:55.759 --> 00:44:57.961
OUT. A FEW MINUTES LATER, WE

00:44:58.028 --> 00:45:00.097
HEAR THE PAGE OVER THE LOUD

00:45:00.164 --> 00:45:01.999
INTERCOM CODE BLUE. AFTER SIX

00:45:02.066 --> 00:45:03.434
LONG MINUTES, THEY GOT A PULSE

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:04.735
AND THE DOCTOR SAID THAT HE

00:45:04.802 --> 00:45:07.337
NEEDED TO TALK TO US. HE SAID HE

00:45:07.404 --> 00:45:09.773
FOUND A BLUE MEDICINE CAP IN HER

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:11.508
AIRWAY. HE TOLD US IT WAS FROM

00:45:11.575 --> 00:45:13.710
ONE OF THE MEDICATIONS SHE WAS

00:45:13.777 --> 00:45:15.212
GIVEN IN NOVEMBER, WHEN SHE WAS

00:45:15.279 --> 00:45:17.114
INTUBATED. THE BLUE MEDICINE CAP

00:45:17.181 --> 00:45:18.949
HAD BEEN LODGED IN HER AIRWAY

00:45:19.016 --> 00:45:21.051
FOR OVER A MONTH. NEEDLESS TO

00:45:21.118 --> 00:45:22.419
SAY, THIS WAS ALL TOO MUCH FOR

00:45:22.486 --> 00:45:24.488
HER BODY TO HANDLE. SHE WAS ON

00:45:24.555 --> 00:45:26.523
FULL LIFE SUPPORT WHILE HER BODY

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:28.092
WAS SHUTTING DOWN. I STAYED WITH

00:45:28.158 --> 00:45:30.260
MY MOM BY HER SIDE ALL THOSE

00:45:30.327 --> 00:45:31.462
REMAINING DAYS, HOLDING HER

00:45:31.528 --> 00:45:33.530
HAND, TALKING TO HER, PRAYING.

00:45:33.597 --> 00:45:36.033
BUT SADLY, ON WEDNESDAY,

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:38.168
DECEMBER 13TH, SHE PASSED AWAY.

00:45:38.235 --> 00:45:39.770
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY MOM?

00:45:39.837 --> 00:45:40.604
HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR SENATE

00:45:40.671 --> 00:45:44.108
BILL 29. THIS BILL IS ABOUT

00:45:44.174 --> 00:45:45.476
ACCOUNTABILITY AND PROTECTING

00:45:45.542 --> 00:45:47.544

HONOR THE SUFFERING OF THEIR

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:51.949
LOVED ONES WHO ARE NO LONGER

00:45:52.015 --> 00:45:53.984
HERE TO FIGHT FOR THEMSELVES.

00:45:54.051 --> 00:45:57.387
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU,

MR. CHAIR. MEMBERS OF THE

00:45:58.489 --> 00:45:59.356
COMMITTEE, JEREMY SMITH, HERE ON

00:45:59.423 --> 00:46:01.492
BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND

00:46:01.558 --> 00:46:02.693

PLUMBING, INSULATION AND OTHER

00:46:10.434 --> 00:46:11.568
TRADES HAVE BUILT CALIFORNIA

00:46:11.635 --> 00:46:13.370
FROM THE GROUND UP, BUT TOO MANY

00:46:13.437 --> 00:46:15.839
OF THEM HAVE PAID THE PRICE WITH

00:46:15.906 --> 00:46:17.608
THEIR HEALTH AND THEIR LIVES DUE

00:46:17.674 --> 00:46:18.909
TO LONG TERM EXPOSURE TO TOXIC

00:46:18.976 --> 00:46:19.676
SUBSTANCES LIKE ASBESTOS AND

00:46:19.743 --> 00:46:21.445
SILICA ON THE JOB. THESE

00:46:21.512 --> 00:46:23.947
DISEASES ARE CRUEL. ASBESTOS AND

00:46:24.014 --> 00:46:25.382
SILICA RELATED ILLNESSES,

00:46:25.449 --> 00:46:26.917
INCLUDING MESOTHELIOMA AND

SILICOSIS, OFTEN TAKE DECADES TO

00:46:28.785 --> 00:46:31.155
SURFACE, AND ALMOST MORE

00:46:31.221 --> 00:46:32.589
INSIDIOUSLY, SOMETIMES THEY

00:46:32.656 --> 00:46:35.259
SURFACE IN FAMILY MEMBERS OF

00:46:35.325 --> 00:46:37.027
WORKERS WHO BRING HOME THE TOXIC

00:46:37.094 --> 00:46:39.062
SUBSTANCES ON THEIR CLOTHING

00:46:39.129 --> 00:46:40.564
WHEN THEY DO. THE PROGNOSIS IS

00:46:40.631 --> 00:46:42.299
FATAL AND THE TIMELINE IS SHORT.

00:46:42.366 --> 00:46:44.268
SB 29 ENSURES THAT WHEN A WORKER

00:46:44.334 --> 00:46:45.502
WHO HAS SUFFERED UNIMAGINABLE

00:46:45.569 --> 00:46:47.337
PAIN, UNIMAGINABLE PAIN FROM

00:46:47.404 --> 00:46:49.273
TOXIC EXPOSURE DIES BEFORE THEIR

00:46:49.339 --> 00:46:51.341
CASE IS RESOLVED, THEIR CLAIM

00:46:51.408 --> 00:46:52.409
FOR PAIN AND SUFFERING DOESN'T

00:46:52.476 --> 00:46:54.611
DIE WITH THEM. THAT'S NOT JUST A

00:46:54.678 --> 00:46:55.612
LEGAL TECHNICALITY. IT'S A

00:46:55.679 --> 00:46:57.514
MATTER OF DIGNITY AND JUSTICE

00:46:57.581 --> 00:46:58.649
FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR

00:46:58.715 --> 00:46:59.750
FAMILIES. FAMILIES WHO WATCH

00:46:59.816 --> 00:47:00.851
THEIR LOVED ONES SUFFER

00:47:00.918 --> 00:47:01.785
SHOULDN'T BE DENIED

00:47:01.852 --> 00:47:02.452
ACCOUNTABILITY JUST BECAUSE THAT

00:47:02.519 --> 00:47:03.887
SUFFERING ENDED IN DEATH BEFORE

00:47:03.954 --> 00:47:05.455
TRIAL. SOMETIMES TRIALS THAT

00:47:05.522 --> 00:47:07.624
WERE STRUNG OUT SO THAT A WORKER

00:47:07.691 --> 00:47:09.960
WOULD DIE. THIS BILL DOESN'T

00:47:10.027 --> 00:47:10.894
CREATE NEW RIGHTS. IT SIMPLY

00:47:10.961 --> 00:47:12.563
EXTENDS AN EXISTING SUNSET FOR A

00:47:12.629 --> 00:47:13.997

00:47:14.064 --> 00:47:15.098
ENSURES COMPANIES DON'T RUN OUT

THE CLOCK ON VICTIMS. IT

00:47:16.967 --> 00:47:18.035
PROTECTS VICTIMS, IT DETERS

00:47:18.101 --> 00:47:19.536
CORPORATE NEGLIGENCE, AND IT

00:47:19.603 --> 00:47:21.205
UPHOLDS FAIRNESS. ON BEHALF OF

00:47:21.271 --> 00:47:22.606

CALIFORNIA, RESPECTFULLY, TO THE

00:50:16.546 --> 00:50:18.815
AUTHOR, SENATOR LAIRD, WE ARE

00:50:18.882 --> 00:50:20.884
NOT IN FAVOR OF WHAT WE VIEW AS

00:50:20.951 --> 00:50:22.119
AN ARBITRARY, ARBITRARY

00:50:22.185 --> 00:50:23.487
EXTENSION OF THIS FOUR YEAR

00:50:23.553 --> 00:50:25.555
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. AS THE

00:50:25.622 --> 00:50:28.525
GOOD SENATOR NOTED, HIS SB 447

00:50:28.592 --> 00:50:32.896
FROM 2021 WAS SCHEDULED TO

00:50:32.963 --> 00:50:34.297
SUNSET AT THE END OF THIS

00:50:34.364 --> 00:50:35.999
CALENDAR YEAR, AT LEAST FROM

00:50:36.066 --> 00:50:37.768
JACK'S PERSPECTIVE. WE

00:50:37.834 --> 00:50:41.171
ATTRIBUTED THIS BILL, SB 447,

00:50:41.238 --> 00:50:43.507
THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT EXTENDING

00:50:43.573 --> 00:50:46.042
AS ITS PURPOSE BEING THE COVID

00:50:46.109 --> 00:50:47.511
CLOSURE OF COURTS AND THE

00:50:47.577 --> 00:50:50.347
BACKLOG THERE, AND THAT FOR THAT

00:50:50.414 --> 00:50:52.249
REASON, WE HAD BEEN NEUTRAL ON

00:50:52.315 --> 00:50:55.819
THE PARTICULAR ORIGINAL BILL.

00:50:55.886 --> 00:50:59.122
447 WE DO DISAGREE IN TERMS OF

00:50:59.189 --> 00:51:00.457
WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS

00:51:00.524 --> 00:51:02.325
ESSENTIALLY A THIRD SET OF

00:51:02.392 --> 00:51:04.828
POTENTIAL DAMAGES. AS YOU'RE

00:51:04.895 --> 00:51:07.998
AWARE TODAY, A THE ESTATE CAN

00:51:08.064 --> 00:51:10.534
BRING A LAWSUIT THAT INCLUDES

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:12.602
UNLIMITED ECONOMIC DAMAGES. AND

00:51:12.669 --> 00:51:14.871
YES, THERE IS A HIGHER STANDARD

00:51:14.938 --> 00:51:16.339
FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, BUT THE

00:51:16.406 --> 00:51:18.275
FACT THAT THEY ARE AVAILABLE

00:51:18.341 --> 00:51:20.644
THAT THOSE ARE OBVIOUSLY

00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:23.079
SUBJECTIVE AND IMMEASURABLE AT

00:51:23.146 --> 00:51:24.981
TIMES DRIVES UP THE SETTLEMENT

00:51:25.048 --> 00:51:27.484
VALUE. WE BELIEVE THAT

00:51:27.551 --> 00:51:28.819
BUSINESSES, PARTICULARLY SMALL

00:51:28.885 --> 00:51:30.654
BUSINESSES, NONPROFITS, STATE

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:32.556
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT WERE

00:51:32.622 --> 00:51:35.292
CITED IN THE SB 29 ANALYSIS

00:51:35.358 --> 00:51:37.093
BEFORE THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:38.995
COMMITTEE WILL BE SUBJECT TO

00:51:39.062 --> 00:51:41.164
ADDITIONAL AWARDS AND

00:51:41.231 --> 00:51:42.566
SUBSTANTIAL SETTLEMENTS. THE

00:51:42.632 --> 00:51:44.668
OTHER TYPE OF CASE, OF COURSE,

00:51:44.734 --> 00:51:46.503
IS A WRONGFUL DEATH ACTION BY

00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:48.705
THE FAMILY WHICH ALLOWS RECOVERY

00:51:48.772 --> 00:51:50.474
OF BOTH ECONOMIC AND

00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:53.109
NON-ECONOMIC DAMAGES WITHOUT

00:51:53.176 --> 00:51:54.611
LIMITATION. AND SO WE VIEW THIS

00:51:54.678 --> 00:51:57.280
BILL, IN FACT, AS A THIRD SET OF

00:51:57.347 --> 00:51:59.483
POTENTIAL DAMAGES. WE BELIEVE

00:51:59.549 --> 00:52:01.651
THAT THE LAW SHOULD SUNSET. THE

00:52:01.718 --> 00:52:03.453
ORIGINAL PURPOSE, FROM OUR

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:04.855
STANDPOINT, WAS THE COVID

00:52:04.921 --> 00:52:07.123
BACKLOG IN OUR COURT SYSTEM, AND

00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:08.859
THEREFORE WE BELIEVE THAT THIS

00:52:08.925 --> 00:52:10.026
BILL SHOULD APPROPRIATELY SUNSET

00:52:10.093 --> 00:52:12.429
AT THE END OF THIS CALENDAR

00:52:12.496 --> 00:52:14.464
YEAR. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN.

00:52:14.531 --> 00:52:16.399
THANK YOU. PLEASE. THANK YOU.

00:52:16.466 --> 00:52:17.567
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE, THANK

00:52:17.634 --> 00:52:18.935
YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:52:19.002 --> 00:52:20.704
ADDRESS YOU. MY NAME IS PEDRO

00:52:20.770 --> 00:52:22.372
TOLEDO, AND I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE

00:52:22.439 --> 00:52:24.407
OF SERVING AS THE CEO FOR

00:52:24.474 --> 00:52:25.775

MARIN, WEST MARIN COUNTIES.

00:52:36.887 --> 00:52:38.989
UNFORTUNATELY, SENATOR LAIRD'S

00:52:39.055 --> 00:52:41.324
SB 29 WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO

00:52:41.391 --> 00:52:43.827
OUR MISSION OF ENSURING ACCESS

00:52:43.894 --> 00:52:45.695
TO HIGH QUALITY HEALTH CARE FOR

00:52:45.762 --> 00:52:47.397
THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE.

00:52:47.464 --> 00:52:49.499
AT PETALUMA HEALTH CENTER, ABOUT

00:52:49.566 --> 00:52:52.435
87% OF OUR PATIENTS ARE UNDER

00:52:52.502 --> 00:52:54.738
200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY

00:52:54.804 --> 00:52:57.807
LEVEL, AND 8% ARE UNINSURED.

00:52:57.874 --> 00:53:01.077
FQHCS, LIKE OUR SUPPORTED MICRO

00:53:01.144 --> 00:53:03.246
MODERNIZATION BILL, AB 35 THAT

00:53:03.313 --> 00:53:06.716
WAS SIGNED IN 2022, AB 35 WAS

00:53:06.783 --> 00:53:09.319
MEANT TO STAND ON ITS OWN, WITH

00:53:09.386 --> 00:53:11.788
SIGNIFICANT INCREASES ANNUALLY

00:53:11.855 --> 00:53:14.257
EVERY YEAR IN PERPETUITY.

00:53:14.324 --> 00:53:16.760
UNFORTUNATELY, BY EXTENDING THE

00:53:16.826 --> 00:53:19.129
SUNSET CLAUSE, SB 29 WILL RESULT

00:53:19.195 --> 00:53:21.698
IN SIGNIFICANT COSTS FOR

00:53:21.765 --> 00:53:24.334
COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS AND

00:53:24.401 --> 00:53:25.669
PATIENTS, AND HEALTHCARE

00:53:25.735 --> 00:53:27.971
PROVIDERS WILL PAY THE PRICE WE

00:53:28.038 --> 00:53:29.439
RESPECT. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK THE

00:53:29.506 --> 00:53:30.941
AUTHOR AND COMMITTEE TO AMEND

00:53:31.007 --> 00:53:33.443
THE BILL TO EXCLUDE MEDICAL

00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:35.412
MALPRACTICE CASES, AND TO ALLOW

00:53:35.478 --> 00:53:37.514
THE MICRO MODERNIZATION BILL TO

00:53:37.581 --> 00:53:39.916
STAND ON ITS OWN. CALIFORNIA'S

00:53:39.983 --> 00:53:41.318
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS ALREADY

00:53:41.384 --> 00:53:43.219
UNDER ATTACK IN WASHINGTON. THIS

00:53:43.286 --> 00:53:45.655
IS NOT THE TIME TO COMPOUND THE

00:53:45.722 --> 00:53:47.958
HARM BY INCREASING COSTS AND

00:53:48.024 --> 00:53:50.393
HURTING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE.

00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:53.897
SB 29 POSES A SIGNIFICANT RISK

00:53:53.964 --> 00:53:55.031
TO HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF

00:53:55.098 --> 00:53:56.800
COMMUNITIES WE SERVE, ESPECIALLY

COMMENTS OR MOTIONS. MADAM VICE

00:56:29.452 --> 00:56:33.389
CHAIR. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. I'M

00:56:33.456 --> 00:56:35.658
TRYING TO GET MY HEAD AROUND THE

00:56:35.725 --> 00:56:38.094
MOVING OF THE GOALPOSTS WITH

00:56:38.161 --> 00:56:43.466
THE. EXTENSION. IT WAS SUPPOSED

00:56:43.533 --> 00:56:47.604
TO END THIS YEAR, I GUESS, AND

00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:49.873
NOW WE WANT TO EXTEND IT TO

00:56:49.939 --> 00:56:52.142
2030. IS THERE AN END IN SIGHT?

00:56:52.208 --> 00:56:55.345
I HEAR THESE, I HEAR THE SAD

00:56:55.411 --> 00:56:57.180
STORIES, OF COURSE, BUT YET

00:56:57.247 --> 00:56:58.581
THERE ARE REMEDIES WITHIN THE

00:56:58.648 --> 00:57:01.217
CURRENT TIME FRAME. SO TO

00:57:01.284 --> 00:57:02.786
CONTINUE TO EXTEND, HOW DOES

00:57:02.852 --> 00:57:04.387
THAT GIVE ASSURANCE JUST TO HOW

00:57:04.454 --> 00:57:06.122
TO MANAGE THROUGH THESE ISSUES?

00:57:06.189 --> 00:57:09.492
THAT CONCERNS ME. ACTUALLY, I

00:57:09.559 --> 00:57:10.927
WOULD DISAGREE WITH THE

00:57:10.994 --> 00:57:12.262
CHARACTERIZATION OF MOVING THE

00:57:12.328 --> 00:57:14.764
GOALPOSTS, OKAY, BECAUSE IT IS A

00:57:14.831 --> 00:57:16.633
MATTER OF JUSTICE AND EQUITY

00:57:16.699 --> 00:57:19.536
THAT EXISTS WHENEVER IT EXISTS.

00:57:19.602 --> 00:57:21.704
AND IT EXISTED FOR 60 YEARS, AND

00:57:21.771 --> 00:57:25.508
WE REDRESSED IT IN IN 2021. AND

00:57:25.575 --> 00:57:29.946
I THINK THAT WE TOOK THE SUNSET

00:57:30.013 --> 00:57:34.217
AND I SHOULD CLARIFY, AT NO TIME

00:57:34.284 --> 00:57:36.019
WERE BECAUSE I PRESENTED THAT

00:57:36.085 --> 00:57:38.555
BILL OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AT NO

00:57:38.621 --> 00:57:40.056
TIME WAS IT REPRESENTED. IT WAS

00:57:40.123 --> 00:57:42.992
JUST BECAUSE OF COVID. IT WAS TO

00:57:43.059 --> 00:57:47.297
ADDRESS THIS OVER TIME AND TO DO

00:57:47.363 --> 00:57:51.267
IT AND THAT AND THE SUNSET WAS

00:57:51.334 --> 00:57:54.003
IN MANY WAYS TO PROVE THAT THIS

00:57:54.070 --> 00:57:57.440
WASN'T THE ISSUE THAT WAS BEING

00:57:57.507 --> 00:57:59.409
SUGGESTED AT THE TIME. AND SO

00:57:59.475 --> 00:58:01.244
NOW WE HAVE FOUR YEARS OF

00:58:01.311 --> 00:58:03.479
EXPERIENCE. WE HAVE EXACTLY FOUR

00:58:03.546 --> 00:58:05.582
DOCUMENTED CASES PLUS THE

00:58:05.648 --> 00:58:08.084
SETTLEMENTS. WE HAVE NO INCREASE

00:58:08.151 --> 00:58:11.354
IN INSURANCE RATES ON MEDICAL

00:58:11.421 --> 00:58:13.456
MALPRACTICE. I THINK THAT THE

00:58:13.523 --> 00:58:15.692
SUNSET PROVED WHAT THE GOAL WAS

00:58:15.758 --> 00:58:18.494
AT THE TIME. AND I STARTED THIS

00:58:18.561 --> 00:58:21.431
BILL WITH NO SUNSET IN IT AT

00:58:21.497 --> 00:58:23.900
ALL, BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT IS A

00:58:23.967 --> 00:58:26.035
MATTER OF JUSTICE. IT SHOULD BE

00:58:26.102 --> 00:58:27.570
ADDRESSED. AND ONCE AGAIN,

00:58:27.637 --> 00:58:28.605
BECAUSE THERE MIGHT NOT HAVE

00:58:28.671 --> 00:58:31.207
BEEN ADEQUATE DATA COLLECTED, I

00:58:31.274 --> 00:58:33.710
TOOK A SUNSET TO BE ABLE TO

00:58:33.776 --> 00:58:35.445
COLLECT THE DATA AND TO BE ABLE

00:58:35.511 --> 00:58:37.180
TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION IN A

00:58:37.247 --> 00:58:40.917
WAY THAT I BELIEVE WILL PROVE IN

00:58:40.984 --> 00:58:43.019
2030 THAT THERE'S BEEN NO

00:58:43.086 --> 00:58:45.488
DELETERIOUS EFFECT IN ANY WAY ON

00:58:45.555 --> 00:58:47.790
INSURANCE RATES, JUST AS THERE

00:58:47.857 --> 00:58:49.926
HASN'T BEEN IN THE LAST FOUR

00:58:49.993 --> 00:58:51.728
YEARS SINCE THIS. WELL, OKAY.

00:58:51.794 --> 00:58:53.396
THAT'S TO BE DETERMINED.

00:58:53.463 --> 00:58:55.298
HOWEVER, WHEN THERE IS NO SUNSET

00:58:55.365 --> 00:58:56.733
OR DEADLINE, THEN AND SOMEONE

00:58:56.799 --> 00:58:59.602
HAS PASSED AWAY FOR WHATEVER

00:58:59.669 --> 00:59:01.537
CIRCUMSTANCES, SITUATION AND

00:59:01.604 --> 00:59:05.074
YEARS HAVE PASSED, WHAT ARE YOU

00:59:05.141 --> 00:59:07.944
RELYING ON? THE WHAT RECORDS

00:59:08.011 --> 00:59:09.345
WITNESSES THAT ARE STILL THERE

00:59:09.412 --> 00:59:11.481
OR NOT THERE? I MEAN, IT'S JUST

00:59:11.547 --> 00:59:12.348
LIKE NEVER ENDING TO KEEP THIS

00:59:12.415 --> 00:59:14.550
OPEN. AND THEN WHEN WE GET CLOSE

00:59:14.617 --> 00:59:16.319
TO I'M SURE I WON'T BE HERE IN

00:59:16.386 --> 00:59:18.221
2029, 20, 2030 WHEN YOU GO JUST

00:59:18.288 --> 00:59:20.456
TO KEEP PUSHING IT OUT. THE

00:59:20.523 --> 00:59:22.926
PURPOSE OF A SUNSET IS TO PUT A

00:59:22.992 --> 00:59:25.028
DEFINITIVE SOMEONE PASSES AWAY,

00:59:25.094 --> 00:59:26.396
WHATEVER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. IT'S

00:59:26.462 --> 00:59:29.399
ALWAYS SAD, OF COURSE, AND THE

00:59:29.465 --> 00:59:31.467
CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT AS TIME GOES

00:59:31.534 --> 00:59:33.202
FORWARD, THAT SHOULD BE REMEDIED

00:59:33.269 --> 00:59:35.772
DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME THAT

00:59:35.838 --> 00:59:37.340
THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES CAN BE

00:59:37.407 --> 00:59:38.808
LITIGATED. AND THEN NOW, JUST TO

00:59:38.875 --> 00:59:40.944
KEEP PUSHING OUT THE DEADLINE,

00:59:41.010 --> 00:59:43.146
THE SUNSET, I THINK, IS

00:59:43.212 --> 00:59:44.914
PROBLEMATIC. WHETHER YOU HAVE 4

00:59:44.981 --> 00:59:46.582
OR 40, IT'S STILL IT'S STILL

00:59:46.649 --> 00:59:48.484
PUSHING OUT WITH NO DEADLINE,

00:59:48.551 --> 00:59:50.620
MAKING IT OPEN. YOU'RE MIXING

00:59:50.687 --> 00:59:51.721
ISSUES BECAUSE THERE'S A STATUTE

00:59:51.788 --> 00:59:53.923
OF LIMITATIONS ISSUE, WHICH IS

00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:56.392
NOT PART OF THIS BILL. AND

00:59:56.459 --> 00:59:58.027
THERE'S AN ISSUE OF A SUNSET ON

00:59:58.094 --> 01:00:00.964
A PRACTICE. INFORM ME THEN WHAT

01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:02.699
ARE THE WHAT'S THE STATUTE OF

01:00:02.765 --> 01:00:04.667
LIMITATIONS? LET ME LET AN

01:00:04.734 --> 01:00:06.769
ATTORNEY OKAY. THANK YOU. ALL

01:00:06.836 --> 01:00:08.972
RIGHT. THANK YOU AGAIN, AMY

01:00:09.038 --> 01:00:11.841
MARTELL. SO EACH CASE HAS ITS

01:00:11.908 --> 01:00:12.575
OWN STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS AND

01:00:12.642 --> 01:00:14.043
MEDICAL MALPRACTICE. IT'S ONE

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:15.878
YEAR. SO EVEN THOUGH THIS LAW

01:00:15.945 --> 01:00:18.448
MAY EXTEND TO 2030, CASES CAN

01:00:18.514 --> 01:00:20.116
ONLY BE BROUGHT FOR ONE YEAR. IN

01:00:20.183 --> 01:00:21.150
GENERAL. PERSONAL INJURY

01:00:21.217 --> 01:00:23.353
ACTIONS, IT'S TWO YEARS, SO

01:00:23.419 --> 01:00:24.887
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A CASE

01:00:24.954 --> 01:00:28.057
FROM 2022 BROUGHT IN 2030. THE

01:00:28.124 --> 01:00:29.826
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS WILL HAVE

01:00:29.892 --> 01:00:31.194
EXPIRED. SO THIS DOESN'T EXTEND

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:33.596
THE STATUTE FOR INDIVIDUAL

01:00:33.663 --> 01:00:34.664
CASES. THIS WOULD JUST EXTEND

01:00:34.731 --> 01:00:36.332
THE LAW TO ALLOW DIFFERENT CASES

01:00:36.399 --> 01:00:38.768
AND NEW CASES TO CONTINUE TO BE

01:00:38.835 --> 01:00:40.370
FILED. BUT OKAY, I'M NOT A

01:00:40.436 --> 01:00:42.038
LAWYER, SO BUT YOU'RE STILL

01:00:42.105 --> 01:00:43.573
EXTENDING THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:00:43.639 --> 01:00:45.241
BRING CASES FORWARD REGARDLESS

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:48.011
OF THE STATUTE FOR THE CAUSE OF

01:00:48.077 --> 01:00:49.245
ACTION, FOR PAIN AND SUFFERING.

01:00:49.312 --> 01:00:53.349
YEAH. AND YOU MAY BE MIXING THIS

01:00:53.416 --> 01:00:56.452
UP WITH A BILL THAT I'M GOING TO

01:00:56.519 --> 01:00:59.655
PRESENT TO YOU NEXT WEEK. THAT

01:00:59.722 --> 01:01:02.592
IS RELATED TO THE STATUTE OF

01:01:02.658 --> 01:01:03.426
LIMITATION. TIME TO THINK ABOUT

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:05.361
THE QUESTIONS ON THAT ONE. YEAH,

01:01:05.428 --> 01:01:09.032
THAT'S JUST A HEADS UP OKAY. ALL

01:01:09.098 --> 01:01:11.300
RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:01:11.367 --> 01:01:14.003
ASSEMBLYMAN PACHECO. MOVING

01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:17.707
DOWN. THANK YOU. TURN THIS ON.

01:01:17.774 --> 01:01:20.276
THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU,

01:01:20.343 --> 01:01:22.378
SENATOR. I KNOW WE HAD A COUPLE

01:01:22.445 --> 01:01:24.814
OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS

01:01:24.881 --> 01:01:33.589
BILL. I DO HAVE A QUESTION. AND

01:01:33.656 --> 01:01:35.391
FIRST, IT WILL GO TO THE AUTHOR.

01:01:35.458 --> 01:01:39.929
I KNOW SB 447. IT HAD A

01:01:39.996 --> 01:01:43.366
REPORTING MECHANISM INVOLVED IN

01:01:43.433 --> 01:01:45.468
THAT BILL. AND THAT'S WHERE WE

01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:48.504
GET THE FOUR CASES. AND IN THE

01:01:48.571 --> 01:01:50.440
ANALYSIS IT SAID IT ASKS IF

01:01:50.506 --> 01:01:54.177
THERE'S A BETTER METHOD TO

01:01:54.243 --> 01:01:57.713
OBTAIN THIS INFORMATION WITHIN

01:01:57.780 --> 01:02:00.249
THE NEXT YEARS COMING FORWARD UP

01:02:00.316 --> 01:02:03.086
UNTIL 2030. IS THERE A BETTER

01:02:03.152 --> 01:02:06.089
MECHANISM TO OBTAIN INFORMATION?

01:02:06.155 --> 01:02:08.624
JUST I TALKED ABOUT IT A LITTLE

01:02:08.691 --> 01:02:10.693
BIT BEFORE YOU WALKED IN THE

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:13.196
ROOM. AND YES, IT'S IN THE BILL

01:02:13.262 --> 01:02:15.264
AND I WOULD LIKE THAT MECHANISM

01:02:15.331 --> 01:02:17.834
TO ACTUALLY BE BETTER, BUT IT IS

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:20.303
THE MECHANISM THAT WE NEGOTIATED

01:02:20.369 --> 01:02:23.239
WHICH BASICALLY SAYS THAT WE

01:02:23.306 --> 01:02:25.341
WOULD HAVE REPORTING ON THE

01:02:25.408 --> 01:02:26.843
SETTLEMENTS AS WELL AS THE

01:02:26.909 --> 01:02:30.746
ACTUAL CASES. SO IT 2030 OR

01:02:30.813 --> 01:02:32.648
WHENEVER THAT SUNSET WAS DEALT

01:02:32.715 --> 01:02:34.183
WITH, WE WOULD HAVE A RECORD

01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:36.285
THAT WE DON'T HAVE NOW THAT

01:02:36.352 --> 01:02:37.653
DEALS WITH THE SETTLEMENTS THAT

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.188
MIGHT HAVE COME FROM THIS, AND

01:02:39.255 --> 01:02:41.624
WE WILL ALSO HAVE THAT IS NOT

01:02:41.691 --> 01:02:42.692
PART OF THIS BILL, BUT IS

01:02:42.758 --> 01:02:45.261
COLLECTED SEPARATELY. WE WILL

01:02:45.328 --> 01:02:47.830
HAVE THE AN ABSOLUTE EVIDENCE

01:02:47.897 --> 01:02:48.931
ABOUT WHETHER INSURANCE RATES

01:02:48.998 --> 01:02:50.566
HAVE BEEN AFFECTED. THEY HAVEN'T

01:02:50.633 --> 01:02:53.536
BEEN AFFECTED IN IN THE LIFE OF

01:02:53.603 --> 01:02:55.338
THE CURRENT BILL, AND WE WILL

01:02:55.404 --> 01:02:57.807
HAVE THAT AS WELL. AND THEN NOW

01:02:57.874 --> 01:03:00.309
TO THE OPPOSITION AND EITHER OF

01:03:00.376 --> 01:03:02.145
YOU CAN ANSWER. BUT AGAIN,

01:03:02.211 --> 01:03:04.647
TAKING IT BACK TO THE REPORTING

01:03:04.714 --> 01:03:07.283
COMPONENT, BECAUSE HERE IN THE

01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:09.318
ANALYSIS, IT SAYS THAT THERE WAS

01:03:09.385 --> 01:03:11.521
FOUR CASES THAT WERE REPORTED.

01:03:11.587 --> 01:03:13.356
AND I KNOW IT'S THERE'S THERE

01:03:13.422 --> 01:03:15.424
MAY BE A DETRIMENT TO OUR

01:03:15.491 --> 01:03:17.426
HOSPITALS, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO

01:03:17.493 --> 01:03:20.596
HEAR WHAT YOUR INPUT IS AS TO

01:03:20.663 --> 01:03:23.032
HOW TO ACCURATELY REPORT THE

01:03:23.099 --> 01:03:24.133
INFORMATION SO THAT THE

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:26.235
LEGISLATURE CAN GET THE FULL

01:03:26.302 --> 01:03:27.336
INFORMATION OF HOW IT COULD

01:03:27.403 --> 01:03:29.906
POSSIBLY IMPACT OR WILL IMPACT

01:03:29.972 --> 01:03:33.409
OUR HOSPITALS. SO EITHER OF YOU

01:03:33.476 --> 01:03:37.880
COULD TAKE THAT. MAY I? FIRST, I

01:03:37.947 --> 01:03:40.049
WANT TO PREFACE MY RESPONSE TO

01:03:40.116 --> 01:03:42.752
YOU THAT JACK DID NOT RAISE ANY

01:03:42.818 --> 01:03:45.021
ISSUE AS IT RELATED TO THE

01:03:45.087 --> 01:03:46.822
REPORTING. I THINK THAT,

01:03:46.889 --> 01:03:48.457
SENATOR, THE AUTHOR'S

01:03:48.524 --> 01:03:50.226
DESCRIPTION OF THE LANGUAGE

01:03:50.293 --> 01:03:52.728
CERTAINLY IS ACCURATE. I CAN'T

01:03:52.795 --> 01:03:55.398
SPEAK, UNFORTUNATELY, TO

01:03:55.464 --> 01:03:56.899
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SUCH AS

01:03:56.966 --> 01:03:58.634
IMPACT ON RATES. I DEFER TO

01:03:58.701 --> 01:04:00.369
PERHAPS SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES IN

01:04:00.436 --> 01:04:02.405
THE AUDIENCE FROM THE HOSPITAL

01:04:02.471 --> 01:04:03.639
OR MEDICAL ASSOCIATIONS, FOR

01:04:03.706 --> 01:04:05.408
EXAMPLE, IN THAT IN THAT REGARD.

01:04:05.474 --> 01:04:07.243
BUT AT LEAST IT IS, YOU KNOW,

01:04:07.310 --> 01:04:08.377
TRYING TO PURSUE THE

01:04:08.444 --> 01:04:09.712
SETTLEMENTS, BECAUSE TODAY WE

01:04:09.779 --> 01:04:12.315
HAVE JUST A LOT OF ANECDOTAL

01:04:12.381 --> 01:04:14.150
INFORMATION AS IT RELATES TO THE

01:04:14.217 --> 01:04:15.484
SETTLEMENT PIECE. SO I COULDN'T

01:04:15.551 --> 01:04:18.454
BE MORE HELPFUL ON THAT ONE. I

01:04:18.521 --> 01:04:20.656
DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO ADD

01:04:20.723 --> 01:04:23.759
ON. IN TERMS OF CAPTURING THE

01:04:23.826 --> 01:04:27.897
DATA. CORRECT. I MEAN, I THINK

01:04:27.964 --> 01:04:29.198
BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THESE

01:04:29.265 --> 01:04:31.701
TYPES OF CLAIMS, IT'S ALWAYS

01:04:31.767 --> 01:04:33.769
DIFFICULT TO GET SOME OF THESE

01:04:33.836 --> 01:04:34.870
SOME OF THIS DATA, ESPECIALLY

01:04:34.937 --> 01:04:36.739
WITH WITH REGARD TO SETTLEMENTS,

01:04:36.806 --> 01:04:41.811
ALTHOUGH. I MEAN, BUT IT IS

01:04:41.877 --> 01:04:43.412
IMPORTANT TO CAPTURE THE DATA SO

01:04:43.479 --> 01:04:44.847
WE CAN BETTER QUANTIFY THE

01:04:44.914 --> 01:04:48.951
IMPACT ON, ON ON THE RATES

01:04:49.018 --> 01:04:51.954
INCREASES. CERTAINLY ALL

01:04:52.021 --> 01:04:53.723
SETTLEMENTS IMPACT OUR RATES AS

01:04:53.789 --> 01:04:56.392
WELL. IT'S NOT JUST THE FOUR

01:04:56.459 --> 01:04:58.361
CASES THAT THAT THAT WAS HAD.

01:04:58.427 --> 01:05:00.630
THERE'S GENERALLY MORE

01:05:00.696 --> 01:05:01.764
SETTLEMENTS THAN CASES THAT MAKE

01:05:01.831 --> 01:05:03.199
IT THROUGH THE COURT SYSTEM.

01:05:03.266 --> 01:05:05.067
RIGHT. SO IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE

01:05:05.134 --> 01:05:07.169
SOME THAT MAY BE ABLE TO GIVE A

01:05:07.236 --> 01:05:07.770
LITTLE INSIGHT FROM INDUSTRY

01:05:07.837 --> 01:05:09.071
REGARDING DATA. GO AHEAD. YEAH.

01:05:09.138 --> 01:05:10.339
STEWART THOMAS, ON BEHALF OF THE

01:05:10.406 --> 01:05:11.874
CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION,

01:05:11.941 --> 01:05:12.908
I THINK THE CHALLENGE AND WE

01:05:12.975 --> 01:05:14.210
HAVE TALKED WITH THE AUTHORS

01:05:14.277 --> 01:05:15.077
OFFICE ABOUT CAPTURING

01:05:15.144 --> 01:05:17.780
SETTLEMENT DATA, AND WE'RE NOT

01:05:17.847 --> 01:05:19.248
EXPERTS IN THE CIVIL PROCEDURE,

01:05:19.315 --> 01:05:20.950
BUT OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THERE'S

01:05:21.017 --> 01:05:22.585
NOT YOU WOULD HAVE TO BASICALLY

01:05:22.652 --> 01:05:24.387
KIND OF GO OUT TO LAWYERS AND

01:05:24.453 --> 01:05:25.388
HAVE THEM REPORT WHAT SOME OF

01:05:25.454 --> 01:05:27.857
THE SETTLEMENT DATA WAS. WE

01:05:27.923 --> 01:05:29.692
HAVEN'T SEEN A MODEL KIND OF IN

01:05:29.759 --> 01:05:31.193
THE LEGAL LANDSCAPE THAT THAT

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:32.628
REQUIRES THIS FOR, FOR OTHER

01:05:32.695 --> 01:05:34.897
ISSUES. SO I THINK FOR US,

01:05:34.964 --> 01:05:36.132
CAPTURING DATA AROUND

01:05:36.198 --> 01:05:38.467
SETTLEMENTS IS CHALLENGING, JUST

01:05:38.534 --> 01:05:39.402
BROADLY SPEAKING. AND SO I THINK

01:05:39.468 --> 01:05:41.504
THAT'S WHERE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:42.738
REPORT, WE THINK IT'S INCOMPLETE

01:05:42.805 --> 01:05:44.874
BECAUSE IT'S ONLY CASES THAT GO

01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:46.275
TO FULL TRIAL. AT THE SAME TIME,

01:05:46.342 --> 01:05:48.110
I'M NOT SURE THERE'S A POLICY

01:05:48.177 --> 01:05:48.978
SOLUTION FROM ALSO CAPTURING

01:05:49.045 --> 01:05:51.047
SOME OF THE DATA ON SETTLEMENTS.

01:05:51.113 --> 01:05:52.982
SO I WONDER IF THERE'S A WAY TO

01:05:53.049 --> 01:05:54.483
ALSO GET INFORMATION ON

01:05:54.550 --> 01:05:56.085
SETTLEMENTS, OR IS THAT JUST

01:05:56.152 --> 01:05:57.486
IMPOSSIBLE TO GET INFORMATION.

01:05:57.553 --> 01:05:58.521
WE WOULD WORK WITH THE ON THE

01:05:58.587 --> 01:05:59.722
MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. IT'S NOT

01:05:59.789 --> 01:06:01.424
TOTALLY OUR EXPERTISE ON THE

01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:03.125
CIVIL PROCEDURE SIDE AS FAR AS

01:06:03.192 --> 01:06:04.493
WHAT LAWYERS. SO WE WOULD WORK

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:05.761
WITH THE COMMITTEE. BUT BUT

01:06:05.828 --> 01:06:07.330
THAT'S AS WE'VE EXPLORED THIS

01:06:07.396 --> 01:06:08.898
IDEA. THERE HAS BEEN SOME

01:06:08.964 --> 01:06:09.532
CHALLENGES AROUND. YOU'D HAVE TO

01:06:09.598 --> 01:06:11.167
PUT A REPORTING MANDATE OUT AND

01:06:11.233 --> 01:06:12.601
HOW THAT WOULD COME BACK,

01:06:12.668 --> 01:06:13.869
BECAUSE I ALSO THINK IT'S

01:06:13.936 --> 01:06:15.104
IMPORTANT TO GET THIS

01:06:15.171 --> 01:06:16.439
INFORMATION FOR THE LEGISLATURE

01:06:16.505 --> 01:06:18.341
SO THAT WE CAN MAKE BETTER AND

01:06:18.407 --> 01:06:20.242
MORE INFORMED DECISIONS. BUT IT

01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:22.278
LOOKS LIKE I DON'T KNOW IF ONE

01:06:22.345 --> 01:06:23.979
OF THE WITNESSES WANTS TO HAVE

01:06:24.046 --> 01:06:26.482
SOME INPUT ON THAT. IT LOOKED

01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:28.517
LIKE YOU WANTED TO ANSWER. SURE.

01:06:28.584 --> 01:06:29.752
AS A PLAINTIFF'S ATTORNEY, ONE

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:31.320
OF THE DIFFICULTIES IN REPORTING

01:06:31.387 --> 01:06:32.555
THESE TYPES OF SETTLEMENTS IS

01:06:32.621 --> 01:06:34.023
THE DEFENSE COUNSEL REQUIRE US

01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:36.392
TO SIGN CONFIDENTIALITY,

01:06:36.459 --> 01:06:37.293
INCLUDING THE MEDICAL INSURANCE

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:38.928
INDUSTRY THAT'S HERE TODAY.

01:06:38.994 --> 01:06:40.663
THEY'RE THE ONES THAT REQUIRE US

01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:42.231
TO KEEP IT CONFIDENTIAL. SO

01:06:42.298 --> 01:06:43.599
THERE WOULD NEED TO BE A

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:45.401
COMPROMISE ON BOTH SIDES THAT WE

01:06:45.468 --> 01:06:46.702
COULD REPORT TO THE JUDICIAL

01:06:46.769 --> 01:06:48.604
COUNCIL, THE SETTLEMENTS. ALSO,

01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:49.839
SOME OF THE PROBLEM WITH

01:06:49.905 --> 01:06:51.107
SETTLEMENTS IS THAT THEY DON'T

01:06:51.173 --> 01:06:52.341
ALLOCATE IF THERE'S MULTIPLE

01:06:52.408 --> 01:06:54.076
CAUSES OF ACTION. SETTLEMENT

01:06:54.143 --> 01:06:55.444
AGREEMENTS DON'T TYPICALLY

01:06:55.511 --> 01:06:57.346
ALLOCATE. THIS MUCH IS FOR

01:06:57.413 --> 01:06:59.448
WRONGFUL DEATH, THIS MUCH IS FOR

01:06:59.515 --> 01:07:01.250
SURVIVAL, AND THIS MUCH IS FOR

01:07:01.317 --> 01:07:03.085
ECONOMIC DAMAGES. SO IF YOU HAVE

01:07:03.152 --> 01:07:05.187
A CASE WITH A TOTAL VALUE OF 2

01:07:05.254 --> 01:07:07.356
MILLION AND YOU SETTLE FOR

01:07:07.423 --> 01:07:08.758
500,000, YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH

01:07:08.824 --> 01:07:11.260
OF THAT IS ATTRIBUTED. SO THERE

01:07:11.327 --> 01:07:11.927
ARE SOME CHALLENGES THAT I HOPE

01:07:11.994 --> 01:07:13.763
WE CAN ALL WORK TOGETHER ON TO

01:07:13.829 --> 01:07:15.664
CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO CAPTURE

01:07:15.731 --> 01:07:16.298
THE IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT

01:07:16.365 --> 01:07:18.134
WE NEED. OKAY. AND I THINK

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:19.335
THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO GET

01:07:19.402 --> 01:07:21.270
THE INFORMATION. SO IF THERE'S A

01:07:21.337 --> 01:07:24.273
WAY TO BETTER GET THIS

01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:25.307
INFORMATION, I THINK THAT WOULD

01:07:25.374 --> 01:07:27.476
BE HELPFUL. WHAT I FEEL MORE

01:07:27.543 --> 01:07:29.545
COMFORTABLE AND I KNOW WE'VE THE

01:07:29.612 --> 01:07:31.247
SENATOR AND I HAVE SPOKEN. WHAT

01:07:31.313 --> 01:07:33.182
I FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE ABOUT

01:07:33.249 --> 01:07:34.517
THIS BILL IS THAT THERE IS A

01:07:34.583 --> 01:07:36.352
SUNSET SO THAT WE CAN GATHER

01:07:36.419 --> 01:07:39.622
THIS INFORMATION SO WE CAN KNOW

01:07:39.688 --> 01:07:41.490
EXACTLY HOW THE IMPACT WOULD BE.

01:07:41.557 --> 01:07:45.060
BUT I THINK DEVELOPING ALSO A

01:07:45.127 --> 01:07:46.962
MECHANISM OR SOMETHING TO SOME

01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:49.732
WAY TO CAPTURE THIS INFORMATION

01:07:49.799 --> 01:07:52.635
IS ALSO GOING TO BE EXTREMELY

01:07:52.701 --> 01:07:53.602
IMPORTANT. SO I AM VOTING FOR

01:07:53.669 --> 01:07:57.273
THIS BILL TODAY. BUT OF COURSE,

01:07:57.339 --> 01:07:58.874
YOU KNOW IT CAN CHANGE WHEN WE

01:07:58.941 --> 01:08:01.544
GET TO THE FLOOR. BUT I'M I'M

01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:04.079
HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN FIGURE THIS

01:08:04.146 --> 01:08:06.782
OUT SO THAT WHEN IT COMES TO

01:08:06.849 --> 01:08:09.151
2030, WE KNOW WHAT TO DO. AND

01:08:09.218 --> 01:08:09.819
WE'RE NOT JUST EXTENDING OUT THE

01:08:09.885 --> 01:08:11.554
SUNSET OVER AND OVER AND OVER

01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:14.223
AGAIN. SO THAT'S MY HOPE. AND

01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:16.091
OPEN DOOR AND OPEN DOOR

01:08:16.158 --> 01:08:17.460
CONVERSATIONS FROM EVERYONE. SO

01:08:17.526 --> 01:08:19.728
THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU,

01:08:19.795 --> 01:08:21.063
ASSEMBLY MEMBER STEPHANIE. THANK

01:08:21.130 --> 01:08:23.299
YOU. CHAIR, JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON

01:08:23.365 --> 01:08:25.434
THAT POINT TOO, IN TERMS OF

01:08:25.501 --> 01:08:26.035
COLLECTING THE DATA, BECAUSE I

01:08:26.101 --> 01:08:28.103
THINK IT IS IMPORTANT IN MY

01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:29.638
FEELING IS IF THERE WAS A LOT OF

01:08:29.705 --> 01:08:31.674
SETTLEMENT DATA OR CASES TO

01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:34.143
PROVE THE DEFENSE BAR'S POINT, I

01:08:34.210 --> 01:08:35.644
FEEL LIKE WE WOULD BE FLOODED

01:08:35.711 --> 01:08:37.613
WITH IT. AND I THINK THAT THAT

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:39.415
WILL BE NECESSARY IN THE NEXT

01:08:39.482 --> 01:08:41.717
FOUR YEARS. IF YOU HAVE A POINT

01:08:41.784 --> 01:08:43.385
TO PROVE AND YOU HAVE THE DATA,

01:08:43.452 --> 01:08:44.587
YOU SHOULD THEN TURN IT OVER TO

01:08:44.653 --> 01:08:47.490
US SO THAT WE CAN THEN MAKE

01:08:47.556 --> 01:08:48.190
INFORMED POLICY DECISIONS. SO IF

01:08:48.257 --> 01:08:50.125
THAT DATA IS OUT THERE, DO

01:08:50.192 --> 01:08:51.560
EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO GET IT TO

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:53.329
US SO THAT WE CAN MAKE THAT

01:08:53.395 --> 01:08:55.264
DECISION. I SPENT A LOT OF TIME

01:08:55.331 --> 01:08:56.866
ON THIS ON SATURDAY. I CARE

01:08:56.932 --> 01:08:59.401
DEEPLY ABOUT THIS, AND I WANT TO

01:08:59.468 --> 01:09:00.903
THANK YOU, ERICA, FOR BEING HERE

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:02.705
AND SHARING YOUR STORY ABOUT

01:09:02.771 --> 01:09:04.406
YOUR MOM. IT IS MOVING AND FOR

01:09:04.473 --> 01:09:06.942
ME, YOU KNOW, I CARE DEEPLY

01:09:07.009 --> 01:09:08.711
ABOUT VICTIMS RIGHTS. I STARTED

01:09:08.777 --> 01:09:10.446
THE OFFICE OF VICTIM AND WITNESS

01:09:10.513 --> 01:09:12.948
RIGHTS IN SAN FRANCISCO. AND FOR

01:09:13.015 --> 01:09:15.184
ME, THIS COMES DOWN TO A POLICY

01:09:15.251 --> 01:09:17.152
QUESTION. DO WE BELIEVE IN

01:09:17.219 --> 01:09:19.021
CALIFORNIA THAT PAIN AND

01:09:19.088 --> 01:09:20.856
SUFFERING IS RECOVERABLE IN A

01:09:20.923 --> 01:09:23.659
SURVIVAL ACTION? NO MATTER WHAT,

01:09:23.726 --> 01:09:25.194
NO MATTER HOW THAT VICTIM WAS

01:09:25.261 --> 01:09:26.529
INJURED, WHETHER IT'S MEDICAL

01:09:26.595 --> 01:09:28.030
MALPRACTICE, WHETHER IT'S A CAR

01:09:28.097 --> 01:09:30.199
ACCIDENT, NO MATTER WHAT

01:09:30.266 --> 01:09:33.736
HAPPENED. AND IF WE BELIEVE THAT

01:09:33.802 --> 01:09:36.038
WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT,

01:09:36.105 --> 01:09:40.009
AND THE FACT THAT SOMEONE MAY

01:09:40.075 --> 01:09:41.744
LOSE THAT RECOVERY BECAUSE THEY

01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:43.913
DIE, ALSO KNOWN AS THE DEATH

01:09:43.979 --> 01:09:45.381
DISCOUNT, DO WE WANT TO DO

01:09:45.447 --> 01:09:46.549
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT AS WELL? SO

01:09:46.615 --> 01:09:48.150
THE POLICY QUESTION FOR ME IS

01:09:48.217 --> 01:09:49.785
WHETHER OR NOT WE BELIEVE PAIN

01:09:49.852 --> 01:09:51.620
AND SUFFERING IS RECOVERABLE

01:09:51.687 --> 01:09:53.222
AFTER THE VICTIM PASSES AWAY.

01:09:53.289 --> 01:09:55.658
AND IN 1961, AS WE SAW THE

01:09:55.724 --> 01:09:57.259
CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW COMMISSION

01:09:57.326 --> 01:10:00.462
RECOMMENDED THAT WE DO BE ONE OF

01:10:00.529 --> 01:10:02.665
THOSE STATES THAT ALLOWS FOR

01:10:02.731 --> 01:10:05.167
THIS DAMAGE, AS YOU KNOW, AS

01:10:05.234 --> 01:10:06.302
ILLUSTRATED BY WHAT HAPPENED TO

01:10:06.368 --> 01:10:07.636
YOUR MOM. I THINK THAT'S THE

01:10:07.703 --> 01:10:09.438
IMPORTANT POLICY QUESTION HERE.

01:10:09.505 --> 01:10:11.240
I ALSO DEEPLY CARE ABOUT MICRO,

01:10:11.307 --> 01:10:12.641
AND I CARE ABOUT THE DEAL THAT

01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:15.144
WAS STRUCK AND MAKING SURE

01:10:15.210 --> 01:10:16.512
THERE'S ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE.

01:10:16.579 --> 01:10:17.746
IT'S SOMETHING, AGAIN, THAT I

01:10:17.813 --> 01:10:19.915
CARE DEEPLY ABOUT. BUT I THINK

01:10:19.982 --> 01:10:22.518
THAT THIS IDEA OF DOUBLE DIPPING

01:10:22.585 --> 01:10:24.520
IS I DON'T I DON'T SEE THE

01:10:24.587 --> 01:10:26.422
ARGUMENT THERE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT

01:10:26.488 --> 01:10:28.390
DOUBLE DIPPING. IT'S A SURVIVAL

01:10:28.457 --> 01:10:30.726
ACTION, WHICH IS WHAT THE VICTIM

01:10:30.793 --> 01:10:32.161
GETS TO RECOVER. AND THEN YOU

01:10:32.227 --> 01:10:33.696
HAVE THE WRONGFUL DEATH ACTION,

01:10:33.762 --> 01:10:36.665
WHICH IS BROUGHT BY THE FAMILY

01:10:36.732 --> 01:10:37.866
MEMBERS OF SOMEONE, AND THAT'S

01:10:37.933 --> 01:10:39.268
THEIR OWN PAIN AND SUFFERING,

01:10:39.335 --> 01:10:40.769
THEIR OWN ECONOMIC DAMAGES,

01:10:40.836 --> 01:10:42.237
WHATEVER THAT IS. SO I DON'T BUY

01:10:42.304 --> 01:10:45.174
THE DOUBLE DIPPING ARGUMENT. SO.

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:47.610
SO FOR ME, IT'S JUST REALLY DO

01:10:47.676 --> 01:10:49.144
WE THINK IN CALIFORNIA, ARE WE

01:10:49.211 --> 01:10:51.180
ARE WE GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE

01:10:51.246 --> 01:10:52.848
ONE OF FOUR STATES THAT DOESN'T

01:10:52.915 --> 01:10:55.284
ALLOW THIS, OR ARE WE GOING TO

01:10:55.351 --> 01:10:57.753
ALLOW WHAT I THINK IS SOMETHING

01:10:57.820 --> 01:10:59.188
THAT EVERY VICTIM WHO SUFFERS IN

01:10:59.254 --> 01:11:04.193
THIS WAY DESERVES? DO I AM I

01:11:04.259 --> 01:11:05.594
SYMPATHETIC TO THE ARGUMENTS

01:11:05.661 --> 01:11:08.130
BROUGHT BY THE, YOU KNOW, THE

01:11:08.197 --> 01:11:09.898
HEALTH CARE CLINICS AND PLANNED

01:11:09.965 --> 01:11:12.001
PARENTHOOD? YES. BUT AGAIN, I

01:11:12.067 --> 01:11:15.004
NEED THE DATA TO BE ABLE TO MAKE

01:11:15.070 --> 01:11:16.305
DECISIONS AROUND THAT. AND IT'S

01:11:16.372 --> 01:11:18.674
JUST NOT HERE TODAY. SO I THINK

01:11:18.741 --> 01:11:20.075
EXTENDING IT FOR ANOTHER FOUR

01:11:20.142 --> 01:11:22.544
YEARS AND NOT IN PERPETUITY,

01:11:22.611 --> 01:11:23.345
WHICH WOULD PROBABLY BE THE

01:11:23.412 --> 01:11:25.381
RIGHT THING TO DO IF YOU REALLY,

01:11:25.447 --> 01:11:26.315
TRULY BELIEVE THE VICTIMS

01:11:26.382 --> 01:11:28.951
DESERVE THIS TYPE OF RECOVERY IS

01:11:29.018 --> 01:11:30.719
SOMETHING THAT I'M WILLING TO

01:11:30.786 --> 01:11:31.887
SUPPORT TODAY. I REALLY THINK

01:11:31.954 --> 01:11:35.591
THAT WE SHOULD BE A STATE THAT

01:11:35.658 --> 01:11:36.892
WANTS TO MAKE A VICTIM WHOLE,

01:11:36.959 --> 01:11:40.562
AND THAT WE DON'T ENCOURAGE

01:11:40.629 --> 01:11:41.964
DEFENSE ATTORNEYS. I ALSO

01:11:42.031 --> 01:11:43.465
SHOULD, YOU KNOW, I STARTED OUT

01:11:43.532 --> 01:11:45.467
AS A PROSECUTOR, BUT THEN I WENT

01:11:45.534 --> 01:11:46.402
INTO INSURANCE DEFENSE AND I

01:11:46.468 --> 01:11:48.170
WORKED FOR A GREAT FIRM. BUT I

01:11:48.237 --> 01:11:49.371
TELL YOU, THERE ARE ATTORNEYS

01:11:49.438 --> 01:11:51.573
OUT THERE THAT WILL PROLONG

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:52.474
CASES SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO

01:11:52.541 --> 01:11:54.476
PAY THAT CLAIM. AND I DON'T

01:11:54.543 --> 01:11:55.944
THINK THAT'S RIGHT. AND SO TODAY

01:11:56.011 --> 01:11:58.213
I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS. AND I

01:11:58.280 --> 01:11:59.415
HOPE THAT IN THE NEXT FOUR

01:11:59.481 --> 01:12:01.650
YEARS, THE DEFENSE BAR AND THE

01:12:01.717 --> 01:12:02.851
MEDICAL FIELD AND THOSE THAT I

01:12:02.918 --> 01:12:05.721
RESPECT AROUND EVERYTHING THAT

01:12:05.788 --> 01:12:06.922
HAPPENED WITH THE MICRO DEAL

01:12:06.989 --> 01:12:09.258
WILL COME TO US WITH INFORMATION

01:12:09.324 --> 01:12:10.859
THAT SHOULD INSURANCE PREMIUMS

01:12:10.926 --> 01:12:12.594
BLOW UP FOR OUR HEALTH CARE

01:12:12.661 --> 01:12:13.495
CLINICS, SHOULD INSURANCE

01:12:13.562 --> 01:12:14.730
PREMIUMS GO SO HIGH THAT PLANNED

01:12:14.797 --> 01:12:16.031
PARENTHOOD CAN'T PROVIDE THE

01:12:16.098 --> 01:12:17.366
SERVICES IT PROVIDES THAT I CARE

01:12:17.433 --> 01:12:19.334
SO DEEPLY ABOUT, THEN WE COULD

01:12:19.401 --> 01:12:21.003
REEVALUATE THAT IN FOUR YEARS.

01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:22.671
BUT FOR ME, TODAY, I WILL BE

01:12:22.738 --> 01:12:24.506
SUPPORTING THIS. I THINK IT'S

01:12:24.573 --> 01:12:26.275
THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AND I

01:12:26.341 --> 01:12:28.043
THINK THE POLICY QUESTION IS, DO

01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:28.844
WE THINK VICTIMS SHOULD BE ABLE

01:12:28.911 --> 01:12:30.145
TO RECOVER PAIN AND SUFFERING

01:12:30.212 --> 01:12:32.281
AFTER THEY DIE IN A SURVIVAL

01:12:32.347 --> 01:12:33.182
ACTION? AND FOR ME TODAY, THE

01:12:33.248 --> 01:12:36.151
ANSWER IS YES. THANK YOU. IS

01:12:36.218 --> 01:12:38.554
THAT A MOTION I MOVE

01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:40.255
DEVELOPMENT. IS THERE A SECOND?

01:12:40.322 --> 01:12:42.191
I'LL SECOND. SECOND. ASSEMBLY

01:12:42.257 --> 01:12:45.094
MEMBER CONNOLLY. YEAH. THANK

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:46.995
YOU. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE. I

01:12:47.062 --> 01:12:48.697
WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR

01:12:48.764 --> 01:12:51.400
YOUR MULTIYEAR WORK ON THIS

01:12:51.467 --> 01:12:53.736
ISSUE. IT'S AN IMPORTANT ONE.

01:12:53.802 --> 01:12:55.738
AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK, IN

01:12:55.804 --> 01:12:57.206
PARTICULAR, ALL THE WITNESSES,

01:12:57.272 --> 01:13:00.042
BUT IN PARTICULAR ONE FROM MY

01:13:00.109 --> 01:13:02.644
DISTRICT, VERY WELL RESPECTED

01:13:02.711 --> 01:13:06.315
HEAD OF OUR HEALTH CLINIC IN

01:13:06.381 --> 01:13:08.851
PETALUMA. AND I'M GOING TO COVER

01:13:08.917 --> 01:13:10.119
SOME OF THE SAME ISSUES, BUT

01:13:10.185 --> 01:13:11.653
JUST KIND OF MY THINKING, WHICH

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:14.189
I THINK WILL PARALLEL ASSEMBLY

01:13:14.256 --> 01:13:18.026
MEMBER STEPHANIE'S. BUT MR.

01:13:18.093 --> 01:13:20.229
TOLEDO POINT BLANK SAID

01:13:20.295 --> 01:13:22.731
EXTENDING THIS SUNSET CLAUSE

01:13:22.798 --> 01:13:25.267
WILL RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS.

01:13:25.334 --> 01:13:27.402
WHAT I'M UNDERSTANDING FROM YOUR

01:13:27.469 --> 01:13:29.805
TESTIMONY THIS MORNING IS, TO

01:13:29.872 --> 01:13:32.841
THE EXTENT WE HAVE DATA OVER THE

01:13:32.908 --> 01:13:34.243
FOUR YEARS THIS HAS BEEN IN

01:13:34.309 --> 01:13:37.412
EFFECT, THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE

01:13:37.479 --> 01:13:38.814
CASE. BUT IF YOU CAN REITERATE

01:13:38.881 --> 01:13:41.784
THAT BOTH WITH REGARD TO HAVE WE

01:13:41.850 --> 01:13:45.721
SEEN ANY RESULTING INCREASE IN

01:13:45.788 --> 01:13:50.092
MALPRACTICE INSURANCE COSTS, HOW

01:13:50.159 --> 01:13:53.762
HAVE WE SEEN A BIG SPIKE IN

01:13:53.829 --> 01:13:55.664
CLAIMS? IT SOUNDS LIKE AND THIS

01:13:55.731 --> 01:13:57.466
IS PERHAPS BEFORE I WALKED INTO

01:13:57.533 --> 01:14:00.669
THE ROOM, THERE ARE FOUR

01:14:00.736 --> 01:14:03.906
DOCUMENTED CLAIMS, ALBEIT WE

01:14:03.972 --> 01:14:05.874
DON'T KNOW THE FULL DATA AROUND

01:14:05.941 --> 01:14:07.643
SETTLEMENT. BUT IF YOU CAN KIND

01:14:07.709 --> 01:14:10.813
OF JUST REITERATE, WHERE ARE WE

01:14:10.879 --> 01:14:13.248
IN TERMS OF EVALUATING THE CLAIM

01:14:13.315 --> 01:14:15.651
THAT THIS WOULD INCREASE COSTS,

01:14:15.717 --> 01:14:17.820
HE SAID. IT IS A REITERATION AND

01:14:17.886 --> 01:14:20.088
I'M HAPPY TO DO IT, WHICH IS

01:14:20.155 --> 01:14:24.326
THAT IN THE YEARS SINCE 2021,

01:14:24.393 --> 01:14:26.528
THERE'S BEEN NO DEMONSTRABLE

01:14:26.595 --> 01:14:30.132
INCREASE IN IN CLAIMS OR RATES.

01:14:30.199 --> 01:14:32.367
AND THAT IS TRUE. MEDICAL

01:14:32.434 --> 01:14:34.469
MALPRACTICE WRIT LARGE. NOT EVEN

01:14:34.536 --> 01:14:37.206
THIS VERY SMALL SUB SEGMENT OF

01:14:37.272 --> 01:14:40.242
IT. AND I THINK IT'S MY VIEW

01:14:40.309 --> 01:14:41.777
THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE

01:14:41.844 --> 01:14:43.579
CASE. BUT THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING

01:14:43.645 --> 01:14:45.214
TO TRY TO COLLECT DATA TO MAKE

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:47.783
SURE THAT WE PROVE IT. YEAH, I

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:49.484
THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT

01:14:49.551 --> 01:14:52.955
WE DON'T FALL INTO CONFLATING

01:14:53.021 --> 01:14:56.491
THIS WITH MICRA. AND FRANKLY, I

01:14:56.558 --> 01:14:58.126
ALSO WAS A SUPPORTER OF THE

01:14:58.193 --> 01:14:59.995
MICRA DEAL. I THINK IT PLAYS AN

01:15:00.062 --> 01:15:03.799
IMPORTANT ROLE. BUT HERE THOUGH

01:15:03.866 --> 01:15:06.835
THERE'S NO IMPACT ON MICRA

01:15:06.902 --> 01:15:09.738
LIMITS I THINK THE THEORY SEEMS

01:15:09.805 --> 01:15:11.440
TO BE SOME SORT OF DOUBLE

01:15:11.506 --> 01:15:14.776
DIPPING AS IT WAS STATED. WHERE

01:15:14.843 --> 01:15:18.714
IN IN THE JUST CIRCUMSTANCE

01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:22.351
WHERE A PLAINTIFF WHO IS

01:15:22.417 --> 01:15:25.220
CLAIMING INJURY DUE TO

01:15:25.287 --> 01:15:26.955
MALPRACTICE AND NON-ECONOMIC

01:15:27.022 --> 01:15:30.158
DAMAGES HAPPENS TO DIE BEFORE

01:15:30.225 --> 01:15:33.395
TRIAL, YOU WOULD THEN HAVE A

01:15:33.462 --> 01:15:35.264
SITUATION WHERE THERE COULD BE

01:15:35.330 --> 01:15:37.065
THEORETICALLY BOTH A WRONGFUL

01:15:37.132 --> 01:15:41.703
DEATH ACTION ON BEHALF OF HEIRS

01:15:41.770 --> 01:15:44.539
OR SURVIVORS, AS WELL AS A

01:15:44.606 --> 01:15:48.176
SURVIVOR CLAIM FOR PAIN AND

01:15:48.243 --> 01:15:50.045
SUFFERING, FOR PAIN AND

01:15:50.112 --> 01:15:51.780
SUFFERING. THAT'S CORRECT. AND

01:15:51.847 --> 01:15:55.851
IT ALSO THE REVERSE IS TRUE. IF

01:15:55.918 --> 01:15:57.252
SOMEBODY WERE TO DIE ON THE

01:15:57.319 --> 01:16:00.188
OPERATING TABLE, IT'S JUST AN

01:16:00.255 --> 01:16:01.823
IMMEDIATE DEATH DUE TO SOMETHING

01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:03.659
THAT WAS RELATED THERE. THERE'S

01:16:03.725 --> 01:16:05.227
NOT PAIN AND SUFFERING BECAUSE

01:16:05.294 --> 01:16:06.561
THERE'S NOT BEEN TIME TO HAVE

01:16:06.628 --> 01:16:08.630
IT. SO IT IS TWO SEPARATE THINGS

01:16:08.697 --> 01:16:11.867
MEDICAL MALPRACTICE AND NOT AN

01:16:11.934 --> 01:16:13.635
ACTION FOR PAIN AND SUFFERING.

01:16:13.702 --> 01:16:17.005
OKAY. SO TWO SEPARATE CLAIMS

01:16:17.072 --> 01:16:20.375
BOTH ON NON-ECONOMIC SUBJECT TO

01:16:20.442 --> 01:16:23.078
MICRO LIMITS. WHAT HOW DO OTHER

01:16:23.145 --> 01:16:26.815
STATES DEAL WITH THIS? I KIND OF

01:16:26.882 --> 01:16:29.251
TEND TO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE.

01:16:29.318 --> 01:16:34.323
IF WE WANT TO REDRESS. INJURIES

01:16:34.389 --> 01:16:36.391
AND CLAIMS, HOW DO OTHER STATES

01:16:36.458 --> 01:16:40.095
DEAL WITH THIS SITUATION? THE

01:16:40.162 --> 01:16:43.398
ANALYSIS ON PAGE FIVE TOOK A

01:16:43.465 --> 01:16:45.834
STAB AT THIS. AND I THINK THEY

01:16:45.901 --> 01:16:47.636
WERE BASICALLY SAYING THE

01:16:47.703 --> 01:16:49.571
COMMITTEE IS NOT AWARE OF ANY

01:16:49.638 --> 01:16:51.707
ANALYSIS SHOWING THAT THE 45 OR

01:16:51.773 --> 01:16:53.775
47 STATES THAT ALLOW PAIN AND

01:16:53.842 --> 01:16:56.945
SUFFERING DO NOT ALSO OFFER

01:16:57.012 --> 01:16:58.513
PUNITIVE DAMAGES, BECAUSE THERE

01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:01.383
WAS A SUGGESTION THAT IT WAS

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:02.050
DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT IN

01:17:02.117 --> 01:17:03.852
DIFFERENT STATES. SOME ALLOWED

01:17:03.919 --> 01:17:06.355
PAIN AND SUFFERING WITH

01:17:06.421 --> 01:17:09.558
PUNITIVE, SOME DIDN'T. BUT THE

01:17:09.624 --> 01:17:12.861
ANALYSIS BASICALLY SAYS THEY

01:17:12.928 --> 01:17:14.363
CAN'T GET THERE, BUT THEY DON'T

01:17:14.429 --> 01:17:15.931
HAVE EVIDENCE THAT THAT'S THE

01:17:15.998 --> 01:17:17.866
CASE. BUT THEY'RE BUT THEY DO

01:17:17.933 --> 01:17:21.436
ALLOW FOR SURVIVOR CLAIMS ON

01:17:21.503 --> 01:17:23.972
PAIN AND SUFFERING IN OTHER

01:17:24.039 --> 01:17:26.141
STATES. YES, YES. BUT IT'S A

01:17:26.208 --> 01:17:28.577
QUESTION OF WHETHER THE ANALYSIS

01:17:28.643 --> 01:17:29.344
COULDN'T ADDRESS WHETHER THAT

01:17:29.411 --> 01:17:33.515
WAS EVERY STATE OF THE OF THE 45

01:17:33.582 --> 01:17:36.551
OR 47. OKAY, GREAT. NO, I THINK

01:17:36.618 --> 01:17:39.855
THAT THAT ANSWERS MY QUESTIONS.

01:17:39.921 --> 01:17:40.922
AGAIN. I THINK WE'RE ALL GOING

01:17:40.989 --> 01:17:43.492
TO BE INTERESTED IN SEEING

01:17:43.558 --> 01:17:46.061
ADDITIONAL DATA. WE ARE MINDFUL

01:17:46.128 --> 01:17:49.965
OF HEALTH CARE COSTS, INSURANCE

01:17:50.032 --> 01:17:51.733
PREMIUMS, PARTICULARLY AS THEY

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:54.236
RELATE TO CLINICS AND THE

01:17:54.302 --> 01:17:56.138
IMPORTANT WORK THEY DO. BUT

01:17:56.204 --> 01:17:57.839
FRANKLY, ALL HEALTH CARE

01:17:57.906 --> 01:18:00.242
PROVIDERS. BUT THAT HAVING BEEN

01:18:00.308 --> 01:18:02.611
SAID, I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO

01:18:02.677 --> 01:18:05.747
RECOGNIZE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

01:18:05.814 --> 01:18:08.250
DIFFERENT TYPES OF CLAIMS,

01:18:08.316 --> 01:18:11.853
DIFFERENT KINDS OF RIGHTS HERE.

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:15.123
AND ON THAT BASIS, I'M PREPARED

01:18:15.190 --> 01:18:17.726
TO VOTE FOR THIS TODAY AND

01:18:17.793 --> 01:18:20.529
CONTINUE TO KIND OF DIG DEEPER

01:18:20.595 --> 01:18:23.799
AS WE GO FORWARD. BUT IT'S

01:18:23.865 --> 01:18:25.167
IMPORTANT, I THINK, TO CUT

01:18:25.233 --> 01:18:27.369
THROUGH JUST THE SUPERFICIAL

01:18:27.436 --> 01:18:29.171
APPEAL OF THE DOUBLE DIPPING

01:18:29.237 --> 01:18:32.307
ARGUMENT, THE CONFLATION OF

01:18:32.374 --> 01:18:34.142
MICRO, WHICH I THINK WE ALL

01:18:34.209 --> 01:18:38.847
SUPPORT. AND OF COURSE,

01:18:38.914 --> 01:18:41.049
ULTIMATELY JUST WHERE WE FIND

01:18:41.116 --> 01:18:43.552
OURSELVES AS MORE AND ADDITIONAL

01:18:43.618 --> 01:18:45.620
DATA COMES IN AS WELL. SO

01:18:45.687 --> 01:18:47.956
APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION.

01:18:48.023 --> 01:18:49.124
THANKS. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

01:18:49.191 --> 01:18:51.960
MEMBER HART. YEAH, I APPRECIATE

01:18:52.027 --> 01:18:53.228
THE WORK THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING

01:18:53.295 --> 01:18:55.030
ON THIS BILL AND THE COMPLEXITY

01:18:55.097 --> 01:18:56.565
OF THIS. AND I'M CATCHING UP AS

01:18:56.631 --> 01:18:58.733
BEST I CAN. I DO THINK THIS IS

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:01.269
AN IMPORTANT REFORM AND I'LL BE

01:19:01.336 --> 01:19:02.604
SUPPORTING IT. AND I ALSO AM

01:19:02.671 --> 01:19:04.272
CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACTS ON

01:19:04.339 --> 01:19:05.474
HEALTH CLINICS POTENTIALLY. AND

01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:07.309
I UNDERSTAND THE DATA ISN'T

01:19:07.375 --> 01:19:08.877
THERE TO DEFINITIVELY ANSWER

01:19:08.944 --> 01:19:10.779
THAT QUESTION. BUT THE CONCERNS

01:19:10.846 --> 01:19:12.681
THAT I'M HEARING FROM HEALTH

01:19:12.747 --> 01:19:14.416
CLINICS IN MY DISTRICT AND IN

01:19:14.483 --> 01:19:16.284
PLANNED PARENTHOOD'S

01:19:16.351 --> 01:19:17.486
COMMUNICATIONS, YOU KNOW, ARE

01:19:17.552 --> 01:19:19.154
SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN

01:19:19.221 --> 01:19:20.655
INTO CONSIDERATION. I HOPE THAT

01:19:20.722 --> 01:19:22.457
YOU'LL DO THAT AND CONTINUE TO

01:19:22.524 --> 01:19:23.458
WORK WITH FOLKS AND SEE WHERE

01:19:23.525 --> 01:19:25.393
THIS GOES AS IT PROGRESSES

01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:27.929
THROUGH THE PROCESS. THANK YOU.

01:19:27.996 --> 01:19:30.298
WELL, YES, ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S

01:19:30.365 --> 01:19:33.201
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. I COME

01:19:33.268 --> 01:19:35.337
FROM A VERY RURAL PART OF

01:19:35.403 --> 01:19:37.472
CALIFORNIA. THAT MINUTES MATTER

01:19:37.539 --> 01:19:39.574
AND RIGHT NOW WE ARE MANY, MANY,

01:19:39.641 --> 01:19:41.176
MANY MINUTES AWAY FROM A

01:19:41.243 --> 01:19:42.611
HOSPITAL OR A CLINIC OR A

01:19:42.677 --> 01:19:45.080
DOCTOR. AND IT'S TERRIFYING. AND

01:19:45.147 --> 01:19:46.448
I HAD DIRECT CONVERSATIONS WITH

01:19:46.515 --> 01:19:48.617
MY HOSPITALS THAT TOLD ME WE'RE

01:19:48.683 --> 01:19:50.485
ONE SLIP AND FALL AWAY FROM

01:19:50.552 --> 01:19:52.287
CLOSING OUR DOORS. WE HAVE A 20

01:19:52.354 --> 01:19:53.855
TO 30 DAY OPERATING BUDGET, AND

01:19:53.922 --> 01:19:55.423
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO KEEP THE

01:19:55.490 --> 01:19:57.259
LIGHTS ON AND KEEP PROVIDERS

01:19:57.325 --> 01:19:58.026
HERE. AND ADDITIONALLY, WHERE

01:19:58.093 --> 01:19:59.828
I'M FROM, IT'S HARD TO KEEP

01:19:59.895 --> 01:20:01.630
PROVIDERS THERE AND KEEP THEM

01:20:01.696 --> 01:20:03.265
PRACTICING. AND SO SOMETHING

01:20:03.331 --> 01:20:05.300
LIKE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I

01:20:05.367 --> 01:20:06.234
UNDERSTAND. THE DATA IS

01:20:06.301 --> 01:20:07.169
SOMETHING WE'RE WANTING. IT'S

01:20:07.235 --> 01:20:08.904
NOT A CHANCE WE CAN TAKE WITH

01:20:08.970 --> 01:20:10.539
PEOPLE'S LIVES IN THE VALLEY WHO

01:20:10.605 --> 01:20:12.140
DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE

01:20:12.207 --> 01:20:14.709
LIKE WE DO IN A LOT OF

01:20:14.776 --> 01:20:15.343
CALIFORNIA. SO THE MAIN THING

01:20:15.410 --> 01:20:17.345
THAT I WANT TO ASK IS IF THE

01:20:17.412 --> 01:20:18.547
LEGISLATURE LEGISLATURE ALREADY

01:20:18.613 --> 01:20:20.615
STRUCK A CAREFUL BALANCE IN AB

01:20:20.682 --> 01:20:22.517
35 TO PROTECT PATIENTS AND

01:20:22.584 --> 01:20:24.753
PRESERVE ACCESS TO CARE, WHY ARE

01:20:24.819 --> 01:20:26.221
WE REOPENING THE DOOR TO

01:20:26.288 --> 01:20:27.956
INCREASE LITIGATION COSTS,

01:20:28.023 --> 01:20:29.791
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE HEALTH CARE

01:20:29.858 --> 01:20:30.559
PROVIDERS THEMSELVES ARE THE

01:20:30.625 --> 01:20:32.327
ONES IN THE OPPOSITION SAYING

01:20:32.394 --> 01:20:34.529
THAT? I MEAN, THEY'RE THE ONES

01:20:34.596 --> 01:20:36.331
WE RELY ON MOST FOR THIS CARE,

01:20:36.398 --> 01:20:38.767
TELLING US THEY CAN'T AFFORD OR

01:20:38.833 --> 01:20:40.569
TO ABSORB THESE COSTS. LET ME

01:20:40.635 --> 01:20:42.571
JUST RESTATE SOMETHING THAT THAT

01:20:42.637 --> 01:20:45.840
I SAID EARLIER. IT IS NOT

01:20:45.907 --> 01:20:47.042
DEMONSTRATED THAT THERE ARE

01:20:47.108 --> 01:20:52.414
THOSE COSTS. AND IN THIS BILL

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:55.250
WILL NOT DRIVE RURAL HOSPITALS

01:20:55.317 --> 01:20:57.719
OUT OF EXISTENCE. AND I WAS

01:20:57.786 --> 01:20:59.955
GOING TO MENTION IN THE CLOSE,

01:21:00.021 --> 01:21:01.756
BASED ON ON THE TESTIMONY, AND

01:21:01.823 --> 01:21:05.293
I'LL DO IT NOW, THE SPEAKER AND

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:08.863
I IN THREE YEARS AGO SAVED A

01:21:08.930 --> 01:21:12.467
RURAL HOSPITAL. WE I DID A BILL

01:21:12.534 --> 01:21:15.704
IN 19 DAYS TO CREATE A PUBLIC

01:21:15.770 --> 01:21:17.572
HOSPITAL DISTRICT. THE DISTRICT

01:21:17.639 --> 01:21:19.975
WAS FIVE DAYS OLD WHEN THE

01:21:20.041 --> 01:21:21.543
BANKRUPTCY COURT ACCEPTED THE

01:21:21.610 --> 01:21:23.578
BID, AND WE RAISED $60 MILLION

01:21:23.645 --> 01:21:25.146
TO PURCHASE IT. IT HAD BEEN IN

01:21:25.213 --> 01:21:26.915
THE RED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS.

01:21:26.982 --> 01:21:28.650
THEY WERE GOING TO CLOSE AND LAY

01:21:28.717 --> 01:21:32.020
OFF 600 PEOPLE THIS YEAR,

01:21:32.087 --> 01:21:33.021
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FEDERAL BILL

01:21:33.088 --> 01:21:35.390
THAT JUST PASSED THIS YEAR, THAT

01:21:35.457 --> 01:21:37.359
HOSPITAL IS SCHEDULED TO BE IN

01:21:37.425 --> 01:21:39.327
THE RED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 6

01:21:39.394 --> 01:21:42.831
OR 8 YEARS. 600 PEOPLE WERE NOT

01:21:42.897 --> 01:21:45.500
LAID OFF HEALTH CARE TO A

01:21:45.567 --> 01:21:47.102
DISADVANTAGED VALLEY. THE PAJARO

01:21:47.168 --> 01:21:48.737
VALLEY HAS NOT BEEN

01:21:48.803 --> 01:21:50.505
DISCONTINUED. AND IF I THOUGHT

01:21:50.572 --> 01:21:53.575
FOR A SECOND THAT THIS BILL WAS

01:21:53.642 --> 01:21:55.644
GOING TO ENDANGER THAT, I WOULD

01:21:55.710 --> 01:21:58.613
NOT BE CARRYING IT, BECAUSE IT

01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:00.615
JUST GOES BACK TO THE EVIDENCE

01:22:00.682 --> 01:22:02.484
THAT THERE'S BEEN NO INCREASE IN

01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:06.154
RATES, THERE'S NO INCREASE IN IN

01:22:06.221 --> 01:22:07.922
CLAIMS RELATED TO MEDICAL

01:22:07.989 --> 01:22:09.357
MALPRACTICE. IN THIS, THERE'S NO

01:22:09.424 --> 01:22:11.359
INCREASED COST. IT'S THREATENED

01:22:11.426 --> 01:22:12.594
THE VIABILITY OF THOSE

01:22:12.661 --> 01:22:16.298
INSTITUTIONS. I APPRECIATE YOU

01:22:16.364 --> 01:22:17.666
UNDERSTANDING THE NEEDS OF THE

01:22:17.732 --> 01:22:18.767
RURAL COMMUNITY. AND

01:22:18.833 --> 01:22:20.302
UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S JUST NOT A

01:22:20.368 --> 01:22:21.536
CHANCE THAT I'M WILLING TO TAKE

01:22:21.603 --> 01:22:23.338
AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME SO I

01:22:23.405 --> 01:22:25.573
WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT TODAY.

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:26.574
BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO ONGOING

01:22:26.641 --> 01:22:27.642
CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU. THANK

01:22:27.709 --> 01:22:28.943
YOU VERY MUCH, SENATOR. THANK

01:22:29.010 --> 01:22:30.245
YOU, MR. CHAIR. THANK YOU TO THE

01:22:30.312 --> 01:22:32.147
AUTHOR. THANK YOU TO ALL THE

01:22:32.213 --> 01:22:33.515
WITNESSES. AND I DO WANT TO KIND

01:22:33.581 --> 01:22:35.684
OF CIRCLE BACK QUICKLY TO THIS

01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:37.218
POINT ABOUT SHARING OF DATA. AND

01:22:37.285 --> 01:22:38.553
I THINK BOTH WITNESSES AND

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:40.355
PARTIES HAVE TOUCHED UPON IT.

01:22:40.422 --> 01:22:43.291
DOES THE BILL. AND I, LIKE MANY,

01:22:43.358 --> 01:22:45.193
HAVE SPENT AN INORDINATE AMOUNT

01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:47.095
OF TIME ON THIS BILL. SO THANK

01:22:47.162 --> 01:22:49.097
YOU. BUT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE

01:22:49.164 --> 01:22:50.765
GET THIS RIGHT. I CAN'T BELIEVE

01:22:50.832 --> 01:22:52.267
YOU'RE THANKING ME FOR ALL THE

01:22:52.334 --> 01:22:53.368
TIME YOU'RE SPENDING ON THE

01:22:53.435 --> 01:22:55.870
BILL. THAT'S RIGHT. DOES THE

01:22:55.937 --> 01:22:58.973
BILL REQUIRE BECAUSE THESE

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:00.508
CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS AND

01:23:00.575 --> 01:23:02.977
PROVISIONS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT

01:23:03.044 --> 01:23:05.480
BECAUSE THEY DO DISALLOW SHARING

01:23:05.547 --> 01:23:06.748
OF CRITICAL INFORMATION OVER

01:23:06.815 --> 01:23:08.650
THESE NEXT 4 TO 5 YEARS TO MAKE

01:23:08.717 --> 01:23:10.285
SURE THAT THE DATA IS ACCURATE

01:23:10.352 --> 01:23:12.487
AND THAT WHEN THIS COMES FORWARD

01:23:12.554 --> 01:23:14.356
TO ANOTHER JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

01:23:14.422 --> 01:23:17.525
IN 2030, WE HAVE THE DATA. IS

01:23:17.592 --> 01:23:18.593
THERE ANYTHING BUILT INTO THE

01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:20.261
LAW THAT SAYS ANY

01:23:20.328 --> 01:23:22.063
CONFIDENTIALITY PROVISION IN A

01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:24.899
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT SHALL NOT,

01:23:24.966 --> 01:23:27.902
YOU KNOW, DISALLOW THE SHARING

01:23:27.969 --> 01:23:29.337
OF THE INFORMATION WITH JUDICIAL

01:23:29.404 --> 01:23:30.839
COUNCIL, BECAUSE WITHOUT IT, I

01:23:30.905 --> 01:23:33.274
THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE BACK

01:23:33.341 --> 01:23:33.942
HERE IN A SIMILAR SITUATION. IT

01:23:34.008 --> 01:23:34.609
SHOULDN'T BE INCUMBENT ON

01:23:34.676 --> 01:23:35.744
PLAINTIFF'S ATTORNEYS. IT

01:23:35.810 --> 01:23:37.979
SHOULDN'T BE INCUMBENT ON THE

01:23:38.046 --> 01:23:39.013
DEFENSE COUNSEL. IT SHOULD BE

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:40.515
INCUMBENT ON BOTH PARTIES TO

01:23:40.582 --> 01:23:43.017
HAVE TO SHARE THIS INFORMATION

01:23:43.084 --> 01:23:44.652
WITH JUDICIAL COUNSEL. SO I

01:23:44.719 --> 01:23:47.689
THINK IF WE DON'T BUILD THAT IN,

01:23:47.756 --> 01:23:48.757
I JUST THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE

01:23:48.823 --> 01:23:50.291
BACK AT THIS SITUATION WHERE

01:23:50.358 --> 01:23:52.193
BOTH PARTIES ARE SAYING WE DON'T

01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:53.762
HAVE THE DATA. AND I THINK IT'S

01:23:53.828 --> 01:23:54.729
REALLY ONE OF THESE, EVERYONE

01:23:54.796 --> 01:23:57.198
POINTING TO EACH OTHER. SO HAVE

01:23:57.265 --> 01:23:58.500
YOU BUILT THAT IN? AND IF NOT, I

01:23:58.566 --> 01:23:59.334
THINK IT'S CRITICAL. I ACTUALLY

01:23:59.401 --> 01:24:01.569
DON'T THINK THAT THE SUNSET DATE

01:24:01.636 --> 01:24:04.839
MAKES SENSE WITHOUT IT. I'M

01:24:04.906 --> 01:24:06.341
LOOKING AT THE AUTHOR, NOT THE

01:24:06.408 --> 01:24:07.942
I'M LOOKING AT WHEN WE WERE

01:24:08.009 --> 01:24:09.310
TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT, AND YOU

01:24:09.377 --> 01:24:11.613
MIGHT NEED TO FILL IN BEHIND ME,

01:24:11.679 --> 01:24:14.849
BUT BASICALLY, WE HONORED THE

01:24:14.916 --> 01:24:16.684
REQUEST OF SOME OF THE OPPONENTS

01:24:16.751 --> 01:24:21.556
OF NOT MAKING IT MANDATORY FOR

01:24:21.623 --> 01:24:22.891
PROVIDING THE DATA OF

01:24:22.957 --> 01:24:24.826
SETTLEMENTS BECAUSE THEY, AS I

01:24:24.893 --> 01:24:27.195
SAID EARLIER IN THE HEARING,

01:24:27.262 --> 01:24:29.330
THEY THEY DO NOT BELIEVE

01:24:29.397 --> 01:24:31.533
SETTLEMENTS SHOULD BE READ AS AN

01:24:31.599 --> 01:24:34.903
ADMISSION OF GUILT IN A IN, IN A

01:24:34.969 --> 01:24:38.006
IN, IN A CASE. AND AS A RESULT,

01:24:38.072 --> 01:24:41.943
THEY DID NOT WANT THE MANDATORY

01:24:42.010 --> 01:24:44.345
REPORTING OF EVERY SINGLE

01:24:44.412 --> 01:24:46.281
SETTLEMENT. AND WE AND HOW WE

01:24:46.347 --> 01:24:48.750
STRUCTURED IT HONORED THAT

01:24:48.817 --> 01:24:50.985
REQUEST. I CAN IMAGINE WE COULD

01:24:51.052 --> 01:24:52.554
REVISIT THAT. AND I THINK

01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:55.423
PARTICULARLY AFTER ASSEMBLY

01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:59.327
MEMBER PACHECO'S COMMENTS, WE

01:24:59.394 --> 01:25:02.096
WILL TAKE A FURTHER LOOK TO SEE

01:25:02.163 --> 01:25:03.898
IF THERE ARE WAYS TO RESTRUCTURE

01:25:03.965 --> 01:25:08.269
THIS AND MAYBE TALK TO DIFFERENT

01:25:08.336 --> 01:25:10.138
STAKEHOLDERS. BUT THAT WAS THE

01:25:10.205 --> 01:25:11.539
PUSHBACK THAT WE GOT AND WE

01:25:11.606 --> 01:25:12.941
HONORED IN PUTTING THIS

01:25:13.007 --> 01:25:14.409
TOGETHER. I MEAN, IT'S THIS

01:25:14.476 --> 01:25:15.810
PERNICIOUS CYCLE, RIGHT, THAT WE

01:25:15.877 --> 01:25:18.046
DON'T HAVE THE DATA AND WE DON'T

01:25:18.112 --> 01:25:18.913
HAVE THE INFORMATION YET. WE

01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:21.382
DON'T WANT TO PUT IN PLACE

01:25:21.449 --> 01:25:22.183
TRANSPARENCY MEASURES TO ENSURE

01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:24.252
THAT WE HAVE THE DATA IN THE

01:25:24.319 --> 01:25:25.353
YEARS TO COME. AND I THINK

01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:26.654
THAT'S WHY WE'RE IN THIS

01:25:26.721 --> 01:25:28.056
SITUATION. AND I'M SYMPATHETIC

01:25:28.122 --> 01:25:29.891
TO FUTURE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND

01:25:29.958 --> 01:25:31.459
SENATORS WHO ARE GOING TO BE IN

01:25:31.526 --> 01:25:32.727
THIS POSITION IN 2030, WHO ARE

01:25:32.794 --> 01:25:35.330
LIKELY GOING TO HAVE THE SAME

01:25:35.396 --> 01:25:36.564
CONVERSATION. AND I THINK WE'RE

01:25:36.631 --> 01:25:38.266
GOING TO KICK THE CAN DOWN THE

01:25:38.333 --> 01:25:39.634
ROAD AND NOT ACTUALLY DEAL WITH

01:25:39.701 --> 01:25:41.636
THIS ISSUE UNLESS WE GET IT

01:25:41.703 --> 01:25:43.204
RIGHT RIGHT NOW. SO, YOU KNOW,

01:25:43.271 --> 01:25:44.405
AND I DO LOOK TO OUR CHAIR AND

01:25:44.472 --> 01:25:46.641
OUR STAFF HERE WHO CAN PROBABLY

01:25:46.708 --> 01:25:47.876
COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT

01:25:47.942 --> 01:25:49.143
WOULD WORK BEFORE THIS. I ASSUME

01:25:49.210 --> 01:25:51.546
THIS WOULD GO TO A PROBES. I

01:25:51.613 --> 01:25:52.714
DON'T THINK THAT THE BILL WORKS.

01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:55.083
AT LEAST THE SUNSET. RIGHT.

01:25:55.149 --> 01:25:56.851
BECAUSE AND MY COMMENTS ALIGN

01:25:56.918 --> 01:25:58.520
WITH THE SUN MEMBER. STEPHANIE,

01:25:58.586 --> 01:26:00.522
I THINK THE POLICY IS SOUND. I

01:26:00.588 --> 01:26:01.923
THINK YOU ONLY BUILD IN THE

01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:03.324
SUNSET IF IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO

01:26:03.391 --> 01:26:06.261
LEAD TO SOME SORT OF DATA AND

01:26:06.327 --> 01:26:07.695
RECKONING IN 2030, WHERE WE CAN

01:26:07.762 --> 01:26:09.597
PUT THIS TO BED ONCE AND FOR

01:26:09.664 --> 01:26:11.299
ALL. BECAUSE IF WE'RE JUST GOING

01:26:11.366 --> 01:26:13.167
TO KEEP PUTTING IN SUNSET DATES,

01:26:13.234 --> 01:26:14.269
IT'S POLITICAL MALPRACTICE. I'VE

01:26:14.335 --> 01:26:15.403
SAID THIS BEFORE, I THINK THAT

01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:17.572
THIS BODY DOES THIS WAY TOO

01:26:17.639 --> 01:26:19.340
MUCH. YOU PUT IN A SUNSET DATE

01:26:19.407 --> 01:26:21.009
TO KICK THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD

01:26:21.075 --> 01:26:23.177
AND JUST, YOU KNOW, ENABLE A

01:26:23.244 --> 01:26:25.313
POLITICAL BATTLE THAT PUTS US ON

01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:26.981
THE CROSSHAIRS UNNECESSARILY. SO

01:26:27.048 --> 01:26:28.383
I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. AND I

01:26:28.449 --> 01:26:30.952
DON'T THINK THAT WE CAN SOLVE

01:26:31.019 --> 01:26:31.920
THIS UNLESS YOU REQUIRE THE

01:26:31.986 --> 01:26:35.723
DATA, THE SETTLEMENT DATA, TO BE

01:26:35.790 --> 01:26:37.125
ACTUALLY SHARED WITH JUDICIAL

01:26:37.191 --> 01:26:38.593
COUNCIL, WHICH WILL THEN GIVE US

01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:40.962
ALL A VERY CLEAR IDEA AS TO

01:26:41.029 --> 01:26:42.363
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. WE'LL HAVE

01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:44.432
THE INSURANCE RATES, WE'LL KNOW

01:26:44.499 --> 01:26:45.533
EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON IN THAT

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:47.001
MARKET. WE'LL KNOW HOW MANY

01:26:47.068 --> 01:26:48.670
SETTLEMENTS HAVE OCCURRED. AND I

01:26:48.736 --> 01:26:51.005
THINK WE CAN ALL HAVE A VERY

01:26:51.072 --> 01:26:53.308
SOUND EVIDENTIARY RECORD AT THAT

01:26:53.374 --> 01:26:54.909
POINT TO MAKE A DECISION ONCE

01:26:54.976 --> 01:26:56.411
AND FOR ALL. AND SO I THINK IT'S

01:26:56.477 --> 01:26:58.613
INCUMBENT ON THE AUTHOR TO MAKE

01:26:58.680 --> 01:26:59.747
SURE THAT HAPPENS. WELL, BEFORE

01:26:59.814 --> 01:27:01.482
YOU WERE HERE, I WAS WATCHING

01:27:01.549 --> 01:27:03.618
THE WHOLE THING. I WAS WATCHING

01:27:03.685 --> 01:27:04.218
THE WHOLE THING. WELL, THANK

01:27:04.285 --> 01:27:07.422
YOU. I SPOKE TO THE IRONY OF

01:27:07.488 --> 01:27:08.556
CERTAIN INTERESTS, SAYING WE

01:27:08.623 --> 01:27:10.491
DON'T HAVE THE DATA AND THEN

01:27:10.558 --> 01:27:12.260
THEM NOT WANTING TO MANDATORILY

01:27:12.327 --> 01:27:13.728
DISCLOSE THE DATA THAT IS THERE

01:27:13.795 --> 01:27:15.763
IS THAT IRONY THAT THAT IS OUT

01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:18.666
THERE WITH THIS. I THINK I'M

01:27:18.733 --> 01:27:19.901
OBVIOUSLY WILLING TO CONSIDER

01:27:19.968 --> 01:27:22.503
IT. THAT WILL GET AN EVEN LARGER

01:27:22.570 --> 01:27:24.772
PUSHBACK FROM SOME OF THE. BUT

01:27:24.839 --> 01:27:26.407
WE CAN HAVE THAT DISCUSSION. WE

01:27:26.474 --> 01:27:28.409
I DO THINK WE HAVE TO THINK OF

01:27:28.476 --> 01:27:29.844
THE FUTURE SENATORS AND ASSEMBLY

01:27:29.911 --> 01:27:31.145
MEMBERS AND THE WHOLE SYSTEM. I

01:27:31.212 --> 01:27:32.447
THINK WE'RE DOING A DISSERVICE

01:27:32.513 --> 01:27:35.149
NOT TO DO IT. AND SO IT'S BEYOND

01:27:35.216 --> 01:27:35.750
US. I THINK IT'S BIGGER THAN

01:27:35.817 --> 01:27:37.752
YOU. IT'S BIGGER THAN US. HERE I

01:27:37.819 --> 01:27:39.153
AM SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. I

01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:40.421
DO THINK THAT THE SUNSET DATE

01:27:40.488 --> 01:27:42.690
ONLY MAKES SENSE IF YOU ACTUALLY

01:27:42.757 --> 01:27:43.524
PUT SOME TEETH INTO IT

01:27:43.591 --> 01:27:44.392
OTHERWISE, AND OTHER MEMBERS

01:27:44.459 --> 01:27:46.694
HAVE SPOKE VERY ELOQUENTLY, YOU

01:27:46.761 --> 01:27:47.328
KNOW, INCLUDING ASSEMBLYMEMBER

01:27:47.395 --> 01:27:48.196
PACHECO. OTHERWISE IT'S JUST,

01:27:48.262 --> 01:27:49.964
WHY ARE WE PUTTING IT IN THERE?

01:27:50.031 --> 01:27:51.633
I MEAN, THERE'S NO REASON TO PUT

01:27:51.699 --> 01:27:53.801
IT IN THERE IF THE DATA IS NOT

01:27:53.868 --> 01:27:56.137
GOING TO BE THERE. SO I WILL

01:27:56.204 --> 01:27:57.105
SUPPORT IT. SO THANK YOU VERY

01:27:57.171 --> 01:27:58.573
MUCH. AND I WOULD JUST SAY,

01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:01.009
SENATOR, GET USED TO IT.

01:28:01.075 --> 01:28:02.844
UNFORTUNATELY, BECAUSE WE GET

01:28:02.910 --> 01:28:05.246
SUNSETS ON STUFF ALL THE TIME

01:28:05.313 --> 01:28:07.048
AND I AGREE WITH YOU, THEY'RE

01:28:07.115 --> 01:28:10.518
JUST DONE IN SOME WAYS JUST TO

01:28:10.585 --> 01:28:11.552
NOT NECESSARILY JUST KICK THE

01:28:11.619 --> 01:28:13.421
CAN DOWN THE ROAD, BUT TO

01:28:13.488 --> 01:28:14.856
REENGAGE ON THE ARGUMENT AT A

01:28:14.922 --> 01:28:16.824
LATER DATE SO THAT THOSE THAT

01:28:16.891 --> 01:28:18.059
DON'T NECESSARILY SUPPORT THE

01:28:18.126 --> 01:28:19.427
BILL HAVE ANOTHER CRACK AT

01:28:19.494 --> 01:28:23.131
TRYING TO DEFEAT IT. I MEAN, AND

01:28:23.197 --> 01:28:24.766
THAT'S NOT EVEN SPECIFIC TO THIS

01:28:24.832 --> 01:28:26.000
PARTICULAR BILL. THAT JUST

01:28:26.067 --> 01:28:27.835
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. AS WAS

01:28:27.902 --> 01:28:28.736
MENTIONED EARLIER, SENATOR

01:28:28.803 --> 01:28:30.672
LEHRER DID NOT WANT HE WANTED TO

01:28:30.738 --> 01:28:33.107
REMOVE THE SUNSET ALTOGETHER.

01:28:33.174 --> 01:28:35.443
AND SO I JUST WANT TO, FIRST OF

01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:37.512
ALL, THANK OUR SURVIVOR VICTIM

01:28:37.578 --> 01:28:39.213
FOR BEING HERE AND FOR YOUR

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:40.515
TESTIMONY. YOU KNOW, I THINK

01:28:40.581 --> 01:28:43.251
THAT THAT'S THE UNDERLYING

01:28:43.317 --> 01:28:44.652
PURPOSE OF WHY WE'RE HERE IS

01:28:44.719 --> 01:28:46.621
JUST THAT IS TO PROTECT FAMILIES

01:28:46.688 --> 01:28:48.222
LIKE YOURS TO THE BEST THAT WE

01:28:48.289 --> 01:28:52.093
CAN. THANK YOU. AND I DON'T, AS

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:53.795
OTHERS HAVE SAID, DON'T BELIEVE

01:28:53.861 --> 01:28:56.931
THAT THIS LOOK, THE DEAL WAS A

01:28:56.998 --> 01:28:59.167
HUGE DEAL WAS HISTORIC, BUT IT

01:28:59.233 --> 01:29:01.035
WAS ALSO IT TOOK MANY YEARS TO

01:29:01.102 --> 01:29:04.539
GET TO. IT WAS HOTLY KIND OF

01:29:04.605 --> 01:29:07.108
DEBATED. IT WAS INTENSE

01:29:07.175 --> 01:29:08.309
NEGOTIATIONS. THIS WAS MEANT TO

01:29:08.376 --> 01:29:10.378
BE PART OF IT. IT WOULD HAVE

01:29:10.445 --> 01:29:11.612
BEEN INCLUDED. I DON'T THINK IT

01:29:11.679 --> 01:29:12.547
WAS OVERSIGHT. I THINK BECAUSE

01:29:12.613 --> 01:29:15.283
THE FACT IS THE MICRO CAP STILL

01:29:15.349 --> 01:29:16.350
APPLY EVEN HERE. AND TO THE

01:29:16.417 --> 01:29:17.318
ARGUMENT THAT THE FLOODGATES

01:29:17.385 --> 01:29:19.053
WILL OPEN WHILE THEY HAVE SAYING

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:20.688
THEY WILL OPEN AS OPPOSED TO THE

01:29:20.755 --> 01:29:22.156
FLOODGATES HAD OPENED OR ALREADY

01:29:22.223 --> 01:29:23.558
HAVE OPENED, ARE TWO VERY

01:29:23.624 --> 01:29:24.792
DIFFERENT THINGS. AND THE FACT

01:29:24.859 --> 01:29:25.760
THAT THERE ISN'T EVIDENCE THAT

01:29:25.827 --> 01:29:29.263
THE FLOODGATES HAVE OPENED UP TO

01:29:29.330 --> 01:29:31.866
ME ALREADY SHOWS THAT THIS IS

01:29:31.933 --> 01:29:33.534
WORKING AND DOESN'T HAVE THE

01:29:33.601 --> 01:29:35.403
DELETERIOUS IMPACTS THAT WERE

01:29:35.470 --> 01:29:36.938
SUGGESTED BACK WHEN THE BILL WAS

01:29:37.004 --> 01:29:39.340
FIRST PASSED. AS TO SEPTEMBER

01:29:39.407 --> 01:29:41.209
ÓRDENES POINTS, WHICH I AGREE

01:29:41.275 --> 01:29:43.010
WITH AND I THINK THE AUTHOR

01:29:43.077 --> 01:29:44.378
AGREES WITH BECAUSE HE'S

01:29:44.445 --> 01:29:45.446
ACCEPTED AMENDMENTS THAT

01:29:45.513 --> 01:29:47.448
ACTUALLY HAVE IN THE BILL. IF

01:29:47.515 --> 01:29:49.851
YOU GO TO PAGE 2 OR 2 ON PAGE

01:29:49.917 --> 01:29:51.919
THREE OF THE BILL ITSELF, IT

01:29:51.986 --> 01:29:54.856
REQUIRES PLAINTIFFS TO SUBMIT

01:29:54.922 --> 01:29:55.656
INFORMATION REGARDING

01:29:55.723 --> 01:29:57.391
SETTLEMENTS TO THE JUDICIAL

01:29:57.458 --> 01:30:01.295
COUNCIL. ANY OTHER PARTY MAY

01:30:01.362 --> 01:30:03.164
SUBMIT THE DATA, AND THAT WAS A

01:30:03.231 --> 01:30:06.400
REQUEST OF OPPOSITION AND THE

01:30:06.467 --> 01:30:09.270
DEFENSE BAR AND THE HOSPITALS

01:30:09.337 --> 01:30:11.105
AND SO ON AND SO FORTH. THEY

01:30:11.172 --> 01:30:12.807
DON'T. SO ON THE ONE HAND,

01:30:12.874 --> 01:30:13.608
THEY'RE SAYING, OH, WE'RE GOING

01:30:13.674 --> 01:30:15.109
TO BE OVERRUN AND THIS, THAT,

01:30:15.176 --> 01:30:16.377
AND YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE

01:30:16.444 --> 01:30:18.279
DATA, BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO

01:30:18.346 --> 01:30:20.348
GIVE THE DATA. SO IF WE JUST

01:30:20.414 --> 01:30:22.183
WANT TO GET RID OF THE SUNSET

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:23.851
ALTOGETHER AND GO FORWARD, I

01:30:23.918 --> 01:30:25.253
WOULD BE FINE WITH THAT, BECAUSE

01:30:25.319 --> 01:30:26.287
IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT THOSE THAT

01:30:26.354 --> 01:30:27.722
ARE CLAMORING THAT THE DATA

01:30:27.789 --> 01:30:29.590
SHOWS ALL THESE BAD THINGS ARE

01:30:29.657 --> 01:30:30.124
HAPPENING, BUT YET AREN'T

01:30:30.191 --> 01:30:31.559
WILLING TO SHOW THAT DATA AREN'T

01:30:31.626 --> 01:30:32.760
REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT WANTING TO

01:30:32.827 --> 01:30:34.729
RESOLVE THIS ISSUE OR SHOW THAT

01:30:34.796 --> 01:30:36.330
THERE IS SOME IMPACT, THAT THEN

01:30:36.397 --> 01:30:38.599
IN 2030, VICE CHAIR AND I WON'T

01:30:38.666 --> 01:30:39.534
BE HERE, BUT OTHERS CAN THEN

01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:41.569
TAKE ACTION ON SAY, YOU KNOW

01:30:41.636 --> 01:30:42.336
WHAT? THE IMPACTS WEREN'T AS

01:30:42.403 --> 01:30:44.105
BAD, BUT THERE WERE SOME

01:30:44.172 --> 01:30:45.339
IMPACTS. WE CAN DO SOMETHING

01:30:45.406 --> 01:30:46.908
ABOUT IT BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY

01:30:46.974 --> 01:30:48.009
HAVE DATA. THEY DON'T WANT TO

01:30:48.075 --> 01:30:49.443
GIVE THAT DATA. I MEAN, IF I'M

01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:52.146
HERE IN 2030 AND THEY STILL

01:30:52.213 --> 01:30:52.747
OPPOSE GIVING DATA, I'M LIKE,

01:30:52.814 --> 01:30:53.714
OKAY, GET RID OF THE SUNSET

01:30:53.781 --> 01:30:55.416
ALTOGETHER BECAUSE YOU DON'T

01:30:55.483 --> 01:30:56.851
HAVE ANY ARGUMENT AGAINST IT. SO

01:30:56.918 --> 01:30:58.319
I THINK QUITE OBVIOUSLY SUPPORT

01:30:58.386 --> 01:31:00.555
THE BILL WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED

01:31:00.621 --> 01:31:02.223
AS A COAUTHOR AND WOULD LIKE TO

01:31:02.290 --> 01:31:04.091
CERTAINLY WORK AS BEST WE CAN,

01:31:04.158 --> 01:31:05.059
AND CERTAINLY WITH OUR STAFF

01:31:05.126 --> 01:31:06.160
HERE, IF THERE'S A SERIOUS

01:31:06.227 --> 01:31:08.329
EFFORT TO HAVE DATA SHARING IN A

01:31:08.396 --> 01:31:11.132
WAY THAT PROTECTS, YOU KNOW,

01:31:11.199 --> 01:31:13.000
PROTECTS THE DETAILED

01:31:13.067 --> 01:31:13.868
INFORMATION OF THOSE INVOLVED IN

01:31:13.935 --> 01:31:15.469
THE SETTLEMENT, BUT GETS THE RAW

01:31:15.536 --> 01:31:18.039
DATA, THE KIND OF THE GENERIC

01:31:18.105 --> 01:31:20.208
DATA OF HOW MANY SETTLEMENTS ARE

01:31:20.274 --> 01:31:21.976
OCCURRING AND WHAT HAVE YOU. I'M

01:31:22.043 --> 01:31:23.311
ALL FOR THAT, BUT IT'S GOING TO

01:31:23.377 --> 01:31:25.847
TAKE TWO SIDES TO GET TO THAT.

01:31:25.913 --> 01:31:27.548
AND AT THIS POINT, IF ONLY ONE

01:31:27.615 --> 01:31:28.449
SIDE IS INTERESTED IN DOING

01:31:28.516 --> 01:31:30.685
THAT, I SUPPORT THE AUTHOR AND

01:31:30.751 --> 01:31:31.719
SUPPORT, AT THE VERY LEAST

01:31:31.786 --> 01:31:33.187
EXTENDING THE DATA. SO IT GIVES

01:31:33.254 --> 01:31:34.522
TIME TO HOPEFULLY COME TO THAT

01:31:34.589 --> 01:31:37.158
PLACE. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE?

01:31:37.225 --> 01:31:40.761
YES. THANK YOU. AND WITH SOME

01:31:40.828 --> 01:31:42.263
AMUSEMENT. I'M ENJOYING ASSEMBLY

01:31:42.330 --> 01:31:44.332
MEMBER GARABEDIAN'S COMMENTS

01:31:44.398 --> 01:31:45.766
BECAUSE I HOPE FOR ENOUGH DATA,

01:31:45.833 --> 01:31:47.768
BECAUSE MY OWN STATUTE OF

01:31:47.835 --> 01:31:49.637
LIMITATIONS WILL KICK IN AND HE

01:31:49.704 --> 01:31:51.239
WILL BE PRESENTING THE BILL IN

01:31:51.305 --> 01:31:57.612
2030. I WANT TO TAKE THIS

01:31:57.678 --> 01:31:59.480
DISCUSSION AS TO CLOSE. IN

01:31:59.547 --> 01:32:02.950
ESSENCE, IT WAS SO GOOD ABOUT

01:32:03.017 --> 01:32:05.686
PARSING THE ACTUAL FACTS AROUND

01:32:05.753 --> 01:32:08.456
THE SITUATION IN TERMS OF THIS

01:32:08.522 --> 01:32:10.358
IS A STANDALONE POLICY. THERE'S

01:32:10.424 --> 01:32:13.394
BEEN NO EVIDENCE OF HIGHER RATES

01:32:13.461 --> 01:32:16.697
OR HIGHER CASES. THE 2021 BILL

01:32:16.764 --> 01:32:19.333
WAS NOT DESIGNED TO JUST BE FOR

01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:22.270
COVID. THE 2022 MICRO DEAL DID

01:32:22.336 --> 01:32:23.804
NOT INCLUDE THIS. I THINK THAT

01:32:23.871 --> 01:32:26.307
WAS ALL VETTED IN A GOOD WAY. SO

01:32:26.374 --> 01:32:28.175
I AND I PARTICULARLY WANT TO

01:32:28.242 --> 01:32:30.077
THANK THE WITNESS, ERICA,

01:32:30.144 --> 01:32:33.247
BECAUSE I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO

01:32:33.314 --> 01:32:35.049
TELL A PERSONAL STORY LIKE THAT.

01:32:35.116 --> 01:32:37.919
AND YET IT'S SO MADE THE CASE

01:32:37.985 --> 01:32:39.420
FOR WHY WE'RE HERE RIGHT NOW. SO

01:32:39.487 --> 01:32:41.155
I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN

01:32:41.222 --> 01:32:43.691

WORKERS UNIONS AND ADVOCATES

01:35:00.995 --> 01:35:02.363
HAVE FOUGHT TIRELESSLY TO ENSURE

01:35:02.430 --> 01:35:04.131
THE STRONGEST WORKER PROTECTIONS

01:35:04.198 --> 01:35:06.067
IN THE COUNTRY. AND HOWEVER, THE

01:35:06.133 --> 01:35:07.701
FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION HAS

01:35:07.768 --> 01:35:08.736
ENACTED A WAVE OF EXECUTIVE

01:35:08.803 --> 01:35:10.171
ORDERS THAT WEAKEN CIVIL AND

01:35:10.237 --> 01:35:11.539
LABOR PROTECTIONS, MAKING IT

01:35:11.605 --> 01:35:12.706
DIFFICULT FOR WORKERS TO

01:35:12.773 --> 01:35:14.442
UNDERSTAND THEIR RIGHTS. IN

01:35:14.508 --> 01:35:15.476
ADDITION, THE FEDERAL

01:35:15.543 --> 01:35:17.044
ADMINISTRATION HAS STARTED MASS

01:35:17.111 --> 01:35:18.646
LAYOFFS OF FEDERAL WORKERS AND

01:35:18.712 --> 01:35:20.581
GUTTING OF FEDERAL AGENCIES

01:35:20.648 --> 01:35:22.716
TASKED WITH ENFORCING FEDERAL

01:35:22.783 --> 01:35:23.851
LABOR AND CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS,

01:35:23.918 --> 01:35:25.553
SUCH AS THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR,

01:35:25.619 --> 01:35:27.755
THE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY

01:35:27.822 --> 01:35:29.590
COMMISSION, THE NATIONAL LABOR

01:35:29.657 --> 01:35:30.558
RELATIONS BOARD, AND MOST

01:35:30.624 --> 01:35:32.760
RECENTLY, THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE

01:35:32.827 --> 01:35:33.594
FOR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND

01:35:33.661 --> 01:35:35.596
HEALTH. APART FROM DEALING WITH

01:35:35.663 --> 01:35:37.465
THESE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS, OUR

01:35:37.531 --> 01:35:38.899
AGENCIES IN THE STATE HAVE A

01:35:38.966 --> 01:35:40.134
CHRONIC UNDERSTAFFING ISSUE,

01:35:40.201 --> 01:35:41.302
WHICH MAKES HEALTH AND SAFETY

01:35:41.368 --> 01:35:42.536
LAW ENFORCEMENT INCREDIBLY

01:35:42.603 --> 01:35:44.371
DIFFICULT, AND GIVING THESE

01:35:44.438 --> 01:35:45.439
ENFORCEMENT CHALLENGES AT BOTH

01:35:45.506 --> 01:35:47.641
THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL.

01:35:47.708 --> 01:35:49.009
WORKERS UNDERSTANDING OF LABOR

01:35:49.076 --> 01:35:51.412
LAWS, AND INCREDIBLY CRITICAL SO

01:35:51.479 --> 01:35:54.081
THEY CAN SPEAK UP OR REPORT WHEN

01:35:54.148 --> 01:35:55.549
THERE ARE VIOLATIONS IN THEIR

01:35:55.616 --> 01:35:56.484
WORKPLACE. ONE OF THE BEST WAYS

01:35:56.550 --> 01:35:57.751
TO PREVENT VIOLATIONS IS TO

01:35:57.818 --> 01:35:58.886
EMPOWER WORKERS TO PROTECT

01:35:58.953 --> 01:36:00.187
THEMSELVES WHENEVER POSSIBLE.

01:36:00.254 --> 01:36:01.722
NOT ONLY DOES THIS HELP REDUCE

01:36:01.789 --> 01:36:03.357
THE BURDEN ON OUR UNDERSTAFFED

01:36:03.424 --> 01:36:04.458
AGENCIES, BUT IT HELPS PROTECT

01:36:04.525 --> 01:36:07.361
WORKERS BY HELPING PREVENT HARM

01:36:07.428 --> 01:36:09.964
ALTOGETHER. WE'VE SEEN IN

01:36:10.030 --> 01:36:10.831
ADDITION, THE FEDERAL

01:36:10.898 --> 01:36:12.066
ADMINISTRATION'S POLICIES ARE

01:36:12.133 --> 01:36:13.501
TARGETING THE MOST VULNERABLE

01:36:13.567 --> 01:36:14.935
WORKERS AND CONFUSION OVER STATE

01:36:15.002 --> 01:36:16.670
AND FEDERAL LAWS OFTEN SCARCE

01:36:16.737 --> 01:36:18.539
WORKERS INTO REMAINING SILENT.

01:36:18.606 --> 01:36:20.341
SO ULTIMATELY, WHEN WORKERS ARE

01:36:20.407 --> 01:36:22.743
NOT AWARE OF THEIR FUNDAMENTAL

01:36:22.810 --> 01:36:23.944
LAWS, LABOR AND CONSTITUTIONAL

01:36:24.011 --> 01:36:25.613
WISE, IT IS MUCH MORE LIKELY

01:36:25.679 --> 01:36:27.281
THAT THOSE RIGHTS ARE GOING TO

01:36:27.348 --> 01:36:28.516
BE VIOLATED. AGAIN, THIS BILL,

01:36:28.582 --> 01:36:30.351
SB 24, WILL BE A POWERFUL

01:36:30.417 --> 01:36:31.852
EDUCATIONAL TOOL TO HELP WORKERS

01:36:31.919 --> 01:36:32.953
UNDERSTAND THEIR RIGHTS, SECURE

01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:34.788
THEM IN THE WORKPLACE, AND TO

01:36:34.855 --> 01:36:36.090
FEEL EMPOWERED TO ENFORCE THEM

01:36:36.157 --> 01:36:38.526
IF NECESSARY. THANK YOU SO MUCH

01:36:38.592 --> 01:36:39.660
AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN

01:36:39.727 --> 01:36:41.762
AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. GOOD

01:36:41.829 --> 01:36:42.730
MORNING, CHAIR AND MEMBERS. MY

01:36:42.796 --> 01:36:44.465
NAME IS JAMIL. I'VE BEEN A

01:36:44.532 --> 01:36:45.666
SECURITY OFFICER FOR 11 YEARS

01:36:45.733 --> 01:36:47.968
AND SERVED AS SHOP STEWARD IN MY

01:36:48.035 --> 01:36:49.236
WORKPLACE. I AM HERE IN SUPPORT

01:36:49.303 --> 01:36:51.205
OF SB 294, BECAUSE I'VE SEEN

01:36:51.272 --> 01:36:52.806
FIRSTHAND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

01:36:52.873 --> 01:36:54.175
WORKERS AREN'T TOLD THEIR

01:36:54.241 --> 01:36:55.409
RIGHTS. RECENTLY, WHILE DEALING

01:36:55.476 --> 01:36:57.378
WITH AN OSHA POSTING BY MY

01:36:57.444 --> 01:36:58.712
EMPLOYER, I NOTICED THEY HAD

01:36:58.779 --> 01:37:00.314
ADMITTED A SECOND PAGE TO THE

01:37:00.381 --> 01:37:02.116
REPORT. THAT PAGE EXPLAINED TO

01:37:02.183 --> 01:37:03.317
EMPLOYEES THEIR PROTECTIONS FOR

01:37:03.384 --> 01:37:04.919
REPORTING SAFETY HAZARDS. BY

01:37:04.985 --> 01:37:06.353
EXCLUDING THIS PAGE, EMPLOYEES

01:37:06.420 --> 01:37:08.556
WERE ACTIVELY BEING DEPRIVED OF

01:37:08.622 --> 01:37:10.024
INFORMATION THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE

01:37:10.090 --> 01:37:11.792
THEM REACHING OUT. THIS IS JUST

01:37:11.859 --> 01:37:13.327
AN EXAMPLE OF THE WAYS COMPANIES

01:37:13.394 --> 01:37:14.695
MAKE IT HARDER FOR EMPLOYEES TO

01:37:14.762 --> 01:37:16.330
KNOW THEIR RIGHTS. WITHOUT THIS

01:37:16.397 --> 01:37:17.531
KNOWLEDGE BEING READILY

01:37:17.598 --> 01:37:18.999
AVAILABLE, WORKERS CAN'T PROTECT

01:37:19.066 --> 01:37:20.434
THEMSELVES OR HOLD THE PROPER

01:37:20.501 --> 01:37:22.102
PARTY ACCOUNTABLE WHEN SOMETHING

01:37:22.169 --> 01:37:24.838
GOES WRONG. SB 294 WOULD CHANGE

01:37:24.905 --> 01:37:26.473
THAT BY REQUIRING THE LABOR

01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:28.342
COMMISSIONER TO CREATE A SIMPLE,

01:37:28.409 --> 01:37:29.443
CLEAR TEMPLATE OUTLINING WORKERS

01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:30.744
RIGHTS UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL

01:37:30.811 --> 01:37:32.313
LAW. EMPLOYERS WOULD HAVE TO

01:37:32.379 --> 01:37:33.981
GIVE THIS NOTICE TO WORKERS

01:37:34.048 --> 01:37:35.416
EVERY YEAR SO NO ONE IS LEFT IN

01:37:35.482 --> 01:37:37.251
THE DARK. THIS IS ESPECIALLY

01:37:37.318 --> 01:37:38.852
IMPORTANT NOW WITH RISING

01:37:38.919 --> 01:37:40.120
THREATS FROM WAGE THEFT AND

01:37:40.187 --> 01:37:42.056
UNSAFE CONDITIONS TO IMMIGRATION

01:37:42.122 --> 01:37:43.424
ENFORCEMENT IN THE WORKPLACE,

01:37:43.490 --> 01:37:45.192
MANY ARE SCARED TO SPEAK UP AND

01:37:45.259 --> 01:37:47.027
MORE DON'T KNOW HOW. THIS BILL

01:37:47.094 --> 01:37:48.295
GIVES THEM THE INFORMATION THEY

01:37:48.362 --> 01:37:49.863
NEED TO STAND UP FOR THEMSELVES

01:37:49.930 --> 01:37:51.398
AND HELP EMPLOYERS STAY

01:37:51.465 --> 01:37:52.366
COMPLIANT. WHEN EVERYONE KNOWS

01:37:52.433 --> 01:37:54.568
THE RULES. WE HAVE SAFER, FAIRER

01:37:54.635 --> 01:37:56.503
WORKPLACES. THAT'S WHY

01:37:56.570 --> 01:37:58.672

SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. THIS BILL

01:53:00.673 --> 01:53:02.442
ADDRESSES THE GAPING HOLE IN

01:53:02.509 --> 01:53:04.177
CURRENT LAW. RIGHT NOW, THERE'S

01:53:04.244 --> 01:53:06.146
MANY ETHICS RULES ATTORNEYS HAVE

01:53:06.212 --> 01:53:07.580
TO GUIDE BY, ESPECIALLY FOR

01:53:07.647 --> 01:53:08.915
ADVERTISING. THE STATE BAR HAS

01:53:08.982 --> 01:53:11.117
ENFORCEMENT. CAPPING IS ILLEGAL.

01:53:11.184 --> 01:53:12.218

NO ENFORCEMENT FOR THAT OTHER

THAN THE STATE BAR. AND SO IN

01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:22.562
THE STATE BAR DOES ENFORCE IT.

01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:24.097
LET'S SAY THEY GET A COMPLAINT.

01:53:24.164 --> 01:53:24.964
SOMETIMES THEY LOOK INTO IT.

01:53:25.031 --> 01:53:26.799
THEY'LL TELL THE ATTORNEY THIS

01:53:26.866 --> 01:53:27.734
AD IS UNETHICAL. PLEASE TAKE IT

01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:28.935
DOWN. PLEASE CORRECT IT. THAT'S

01:53:29.002 --> 01:53:30.537
NOT A BIG ENOUGH DETERRENT

01:53:30.603 --> 01:53:31.905
EFFECT. SO WHAT THE BILL DOES IS

01:53:31.971 --> 01:53:33.306

01:53:35.375 --> 01:53:36.476
SURE THAT THE ETHICAL ATTORNEYS

01:53:36.543 --> 01:53:38.378
ARE ON THE SAME FOOTING AS

01:53:38.444 --> 01:53:38.978
UNETHICAL ADVERTISEMENTS. WE

01:53:39.045 --> 01:53:40.246
WANT TO BRING EVERYONE UP TO THE

01:53:40.313 --> 01:53:41.714
CURRENT STANDARDS AND MAKE SURE

01:53:41.781 --> 01:53:43.683

01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:44.284
HELD ACCOUNTABLE. WE'VE BEEN

01:53:44.350 --> 01:53:45.318

HAPPENING, BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE

01:59:33.466 --> 01:59:34.534
SOME OF THESE CONCERNS ARE

01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:36.636
LEGITIMATE, AND I'M HOPING THEY

01:59:36.702 --> 01:59:39.171
CAN BE RESOLVED. BUT I WANT TO

01:59:39.238 --> 01:59:40.640
HEAR FROM THE AUTHOR TO SEE HOW

01:59:40.706 --> 01:59:42.508
YOU ARE CORRECTING. WE ARE.

01:59:42.575 --> 01:59:43.976
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. WE

01:59:44.043 --> 01:59:45.278
ARE. WE ARE ENGAGED IN

01:59:45.344 --> 01:59:45.878
CONTINUING CONVERSATION WITH

01:59:45.945 --> 01:59:47.280
BOTH THE SPONSORS AS WELL AS

01:59:47.346 --> 01:59:49.949
THOSE WHO HAVE CONCERNS. ONE, I

01:59:50.016 --> 01:59:51.684
THINK IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL FOR US

01:59:51.751 --> 01:59:53.286
TO LIMIT, FOR EXAMPLE, ONE'S

01:59:53.352 --> 01:59:55.388
FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT TO

01:59:55.454 --> 01:59:56.722
ADVERTISE SO LONG AS THEY'RE

01:59:56.789 --> 01:59:58.190
DOING IT THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH

01:59:58.257 --> 02:00:00.426
THE LAW AND NOT MISLEADING

02:00:00.493 --> 02:00:02.895
CONSUMERS. AND I, YOU KNOW,

02:00:02.962 --> 02:00:04.363
CONFIDENT WE'RE GOING TO GET TO

02:00:04.430 --> 02:00:06.399
A PLACE WHERE FOLKS CAN

02:00:06.465 --> 02:00:08.000
CERTAINLY ADVERTISE IN AN

02:00:08.067 --> 02:00:09.702
ETHICAL WHOMEVER WISHES TO

02:00:09.769 --> 02:00:10.870
ADVERTISE CAN ADVERTISE AN

02:00:10.937 --> 02:00:13.973
ETHICAL MANNER. THANK YOU. AND I

02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:15.274
DON'T KNOW IF THE OPPOSITION

02:00:15.341 --> 02:00:16.909
WANTS TO MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT

02:00:16.976 --> 02:00:17.977
CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE

02:00:18.044 --> 02:00:20.513
HAPPENING. WE'VE HAD

02:00:20.580 --> 02:00:22.214
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CAC AND

02:00:22.281 --> 02:00:24.116
WE'LL CONTINUE TO DO SO. WE HAVE

02:00:24.183 --> 02:00:28.421
AN APPOINTMENT SET WITH YOU

02:00:28.487 --> 02:00:30.156
LATER IN THE MONTH. WE'RE HOPING

02:00:30.222 --> 02:00:32.325
TO EXTEND THAT TO AN HOUR. AND

02:00:32.391 --> 02:00:35.328
AN HOUR WITH THE CHAIR, THE

02:00:35.394 --> 02:00:38.931
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. I

02:00:38.998 --> 02:00:39.565
THINK IT'S BETWEEN TWO. I CAN'T

02:00:39.632 --> 02:00:42.168
EVEN GET AN HOUR WITH THEM. CAN

02:00:42.234 --> 02:00:44.236
I GET AN HOUR WITH YOU, TOO, MR.

02:00:44.303 --> 02:00:46.772
CHAIR? I'M JUST KIDDING. NO,

02:00:46.839 --> 02:00:48.574
WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING

02:00:48.641 --> 02:00:50.810
WITH YOU ALL. WE HAVE WORKED

02:00:50.876 --> 02:00:52.244
WITH THE STATE BAR AND THE

02:00:52.311 --> 02:00:53.446
LEGISLATURE BEFORE, AND WE KNOW

02:00:53.512 --> 02:00:55.381
WE CAN GET TO A PLACE WHERE

02:00:55.448 --> 02:00:56.616
EVERYBODY SHOULD BE HAPPY WITH

02:00:56.682 --> 02:00:58.551
THE OUTCOME. WE WANT TO BE PART

02:00:58.618 --> 02:01:00.453
OF THE SOLUTION AND NOT THE

02:01:00.519 --> 02:01:02.455
PROBLEM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

02:01:02.521 --> 02:01:04.357
AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE

02:01:04.423 --> 02:01:06.125
BILL TODAY AND I'M LOOKING

02:01:06.192 --> 02:01:06.759
FORWARD TO SEEING THE OUTCOME.

02:01:06.826 --> 02:01:08.194
THANK YOU, MADAM VICE CHAIR.

02:01:08.260 --> 02:01:10.129
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. I AM

02:01:10.196 --> 02:01:11.297
SUPPORTING THE BILL. I HAVE A

02:01:11.364 --> 02:01:12.598
QUICK QUESTION REGARDING THE

02:01:12.665 --> 02:01:15.601
STATE BAR'S ROLE. SO I YOU SAID

02:01:15.668 --> 02:01:17.436
THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH

02:01:17.503 --> 02:01:18.504
ENFORCEMENT THERE. IS THERE

02:01:18.571 --> 02:01:20.740
ENFORCEMENT OR NOT ENOUGH OR

02:01:20.806 --> 02:01:22.108
BECAUSE THAT IS THE STATE BAR

02:01:22.174 --> 02:01:25.311
CHIEF TRIAL COUNSEL'S ROLE TO

02:01:25.378 --> 02:01:27.480
ENFORCE ON THIS. SO WHAT IS JUST

02:01:27.546 --> 02:01:28.781
GIVE ME SOME BACKGROUND, SOME

02:01:28.848 --> 02:01:30.316
CONTEXT. WHAT'S HAPPENING OR NOT

02:01:30.383 --> 02:01:31.884
HAPPENING? SURE. NOT TO SPEAK

02:01:31.951 --> 02:01:33.519
FOR THE STATE BAR, FROM WHAT

02:01:33.586 --> 02:01:35.588
WE'RE AWARE OF IS THAT AN AD IS

02:01:35.655 --> 02:01:37.189
REPORTED TO THE STATE BAR. THEY

02:01:37.256 --> 02:01:39.659
REVIEW IT FOR WHETHER OR NOT

02:01:39.725 --> 02:01:40.292
IT'S ETHICAL, AND THEY'LL COME

02:01:40.359 --> 02:01:41.594
BACK TO THAT ADVERTISER AND THEN

02:01:41.661 --> 02:01:44.230
ASK THEM TO FIX IT. SO IT'S MORE

02:01:44.296 --> 02:01:44.697
OF A FIXING PROCESS.

02:01:44.764 --> 02:01:45.431
CORRECTIONS. SO FOR US IT

02:01:45.498 --> 02:01:47.500
CONSUMER ATTORNEYS, WE FEEL THAT

02:01:47.566 --> 02:01:49.969
WHEN THERE'S A RIGHT TO FIX LIKE

02:01:50.036 --> 02:01:50.636
THAT, THEN THERE'S NOT REALLY AN

02:01:50.703 --> 02:01:51.771
INCENTIVE TO COMPLY IN THE FIRST

02:01:51.837 --> 02:01:53.706
PLACE. BECAUSE WHAT'S THE REALLY

02:01:53.773 --> 02:01:54.740
THE HARM IS ONLY THAT YOU'RE

02:01:54.807 --> 02:01:56.342
GOING TO CORRECT THE AD. SO YOU

02:01:56.409 --> 02:01:58.144
GOT AWAY WITH HAVING THIS

02:01:58.210 --> 02:01:59.779
UNETHICAL AD THAT'S BEEN GETTING

02:01:59.845 --> 02:02:00.413
A LOT OF CONSUMER ATTENTION,

02:02:00.479 --> 02:02:01.480
MISLEADING PEOPLE. AND THEN THE

02:02:01.547 --> 02:02:02.715
SOLUTION IS JUST MERELY FIXING

02:02:02.782 --> 02:02:04.083
IT. SO INSTEAD, THIS BILL HAS

02:02:04.150 --> 02:02:05.685
MORE TEETH TO WHERE WE WANT TO

02:02:05.751 --> 02:02:06.852
MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE

02:02:06.919 --> 02:02:08.387
INCENTIVIZED TO COMPLY BEFORE

02:02:08.454 --> 02:02:09.455
THAT PROCESS HAPPENS. OKAY. AND

02:02:09.522 --> 02:02:12.258
THEN THE SECOND QUESTION, IS

02:02:12.324 --> 02:02:15.661
THERE A ANY DETERRENT IN THE

02:02:15.728 --> 02:02:17.930
PROPOSED BILL, IN THE BILL THAT

02:02:17.997 --> 02:02:20.499
WOULD PREVENT OTHER LAWYERS,

02:02:20.566 --> 02:02:23.269
TRIAL LAWYERS FROM CRITIC BEING

02:02:23.335 --> 02:02:24.770
CRITICAL OF OTHER LAW FIRMS? SO

02:02:24.837 --> 02:02:27.540
IT'S JUST A WAY TO BE

02:02:27.606 --> 02:02:28.774
ANTI-COMPETITIVE, IF YOU WILL.

02:02:28.841 --> 02:02:30.009
IS THERE A WAY TO PROTECT

02:02:30.076 --> 02:02:31.711
AGAINST THAT? CORRECT. YES. IT

02:02:31.777 --> 02:02:33.579
HAS TO BE A MISLED CONSUMER. SO

02:02:33.646 --> 02:02:35.047
A CONSUMER SEES THE AD, THEY'RE

02:02:35.114 --> 02:02:36.382
MISLED. SO THEY HAVE THE RIGHT

02:02:36.449 --> 02:02:38.517
OF ACTION. IT'S NOT JUST A

02:02:38.584 --> 02:02:39.185
CITIZEN LAWSUIT FOR THE

02:02:39.251 --> 02:02:40.219
ADVERTISEMENT. VERY GOOD. OKAY.

02:02:40.286 --> 02:02:42.421
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

02:02:42.488 --> 02:02:43.089
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS?

02:02:43.155 --> 02:02:47.493
DO WE HAVE A MOTION? A MOTION

02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:49.261
AND A SECOND I WANT TO THANK

02:02:49.328 --> 02:02:51.030
YOU, SENATOR UMBERG, FOR

02:02:51.097 --> 02:02:52.598
BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I WANT TO

02:02:52.665 --> 02:02:55.367
THANK THE SPONSORS, YOU KNOW,

02:02:55.434 --> 02:02:57.236
FOR ONCE AGAIN, TAKING ACTION TO

02:02:57.303 --> 02:02:59.405
KIND OF POLICE YOUR OWN

02:02:59.472 --> 02:03:00.306
INDUSTRY, WHICH IS NOT SOMETHING

02:03:00.372 --> 02:03:02.908
YOU ALWAYS SEE FROM A LOT OF

02:03:02.975 --> 02:03:04.443
ORGANIZATIONS THAT DO THAT

02:03:04.510 --> 02:03:07.313
WILLINGLY AND PROACTIVELY AND TO

02:03:07.379 --> 02:03:08.748
THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED. I

02:03:08.814 --> 02:03:12.218
THINK THAT WE ALL LOOK FORWARD

02:03:12.284 --> 02:03:14.553
TO RESOLUTION. AND ALL ALL JOKES

02:03:14.620 --> 02:03:15.488
ASIDE, I KNOW CHAIR ELLENBERG IS

02:03:15.554 --> 02:03:17.723
GENEROUS WITH HIS TIME TO THE

02:03:17.790 --> 02:03:19.158
GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE. AND

02:03:19.225 --> 02:03:21.127
BUT WE ARE ALSO HERE TO HELP

02:03:21.193 --> 02:03:22.928
WORKING WITH THE CHAIR AND WITH

02:03:22.995 --> 02:03:24.730
OUR COMMITTEE, JOINT COMMITTEE

02:03:24.797 --> 02:03:27.867
STAFFS AND THE STATE BAR ETHICS

02:03:27.933 --> 02:03:29.702
COUNSEL TO ENSURE THAT THAT WE

02:03:29.769 --> 02:03:31.003
CAN DEAL WITH. IT'S A RELATIVELY

02:03:31.070 --> 02:03:33.639
NARROW ISSUE. I BELIEVE THAT'S

02:03:33.706 --> 02:03:35.374
THAT'S IMPACTING YOU. AND I

02:03:35.441 --> 02:03:37.610
THINK THAT WE CAN GET TO A

02:03:37.676 --> 02:03:38.544
RESOLUTION THERE. SO WE'LL LOOK

02:03:38.611 --> 02:03:39.945
FORWARD TO THOSE CONTINUED

02:03:40.012 --> 02:03:41.514
CONVERSATIONS. WOULD YOU LIKE TO

02:03:41.580 --> 02:03:42.848
CLOSE? THANK YOU. WHAT THE CHAIR

02:03:42.915 --> 02:03:45.151
SAID OR DID I VOTE THANK YOU.

02:03:45.217 --> 02:03:46.452
MOTIONS DO PASS TO

02:03:46.519 --> 02:03:48.154
APPROPRIATIONS CHOLERA. CHOLERA

STEPHANIE. ZUBIATE. WHAT? THAT

02:04:03.836 --> 02:04:07.473
BILL IS OUT. AND WE'LL GO ON TO

02:04:07.540 --> 02:04:10.609
ITEM EIGHT, WHICH IS SB 645.

02:04:10.676 --> 02:04:11.610
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU,

02:04:11.677 --> 02:04:15.314
MR. CHAIR AND MEMBERS. SB 645

02:04:15.381 --> 02:04:16.415
DEALS WITH PEREMPTORY

02:04:16.482 --> 02:04:17.550
CHALLENGES, AND I KNOW A NUMBER

02:04:17.616 --> 02:04:19.585
OF MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE

02:04:19.652 --> 02:04:20.886
TRIED CASES AND ARE FAMILIAR

02:04:20.953 --> 02:04:22.188
WITH PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES. FOR

02:04:22.254 --> 02:04:23.422
THOSE WHO ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH

02:04:23.489 --> 02:04:25.291
IT, THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF

02:04:25.357 --> 02:04:27.159
CHALLENGES THAT EXIST WHEN A

02:04:27.226 --> 02:04:30.196
JURY IS SOUGHT. ONE IS FOR CAUSE

02:04:30.262 --> 02:04:33.966
WHERE A JUROR HAS A CONFLICT, IF

02:04:34.033 --> 02:04:37.903
YOU WILL, IN TRYING A CASE. IN

02:04:37.970 --> 02:04:39.572
OTHER WORDS, THEY MAY BE RELATED

02:04:39.638 --> 02:04:41.440
TO ONE OF THE PARTIES OF THE

02:04:41.507 --> 02:04:43.108
LAWYERS, OR THEY KNOW THE JUDGE

02:04:43.175 --> 02:04:43.776
PERSONALLY, THAT KIND OF THING.

02:04:43.843 --> 02:04:45.644
THAT'S A CHALLENGE FOR CAUSE.

02:04:45.711 --> 02:04:46.478
THEN THERE ARE PEREMPTORY

02:04:46.545 --> 02:04:47.213
CHALLENGES. PEREMPTORY

02:04:47.279 --> 02:04:48.614
CHALLENGES ARE CHALLENGES FOR

02:04:48.681 --> 02:04:50.149
WHATEVER REASON, PROVIDED THEY

02:04:50.216 --> 02:04:52.651
ARE NOT ILLEGAL. IN OTHER WORDS,

02:04:52.718 --> 02:04:53.719
PROVIDED THAT YOU'RE NOT

02:04:53.786 --> 02:04:55.521
CHALLENGING SOMEONE BASED ON

02:04:55.588 --> 02:04:58.457
CERTAIN PROTECTED CRITERIA, FOR

02:04:58.524 --> 02:05:00.192
EXAMPLE, BASED ON RACE, BASED ON

02:05:00.259 --> 02:05:02.795
RELIGION, BASED ON ETHNICITY.

02:05:02.862 --> 02:05:04.530
AND WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS THIS

02:05:04.597 --> 02:05:07.299
BILL IN SOME WAYS BUILDS ON THE

02:05:07.366 --> 02:05:10.369
EFFORTS OF THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:05:10.436 --> 02:05:11.737
WEBER, NOW SECRETARY OF STATE

02:05:11.804 --> 02:05:16.041
WEBER, FROM SEVERAL YEARS AGO IN

02:05:16.108 --> 02:05:17.843
ENACTING A BILL THAT PERTAINED

02:05:17.910 --> 02:05:19.612
AND APPLIED ONLY TO THE CRIMINAL

02:05:19.678 --> 02:05:22.481
COURTS, THERE WAS A FIVE YEAR

02:05:22.548 --> 02:05:24.950
SUNRISE FOR CIVIL MATTERS, AND

02:05:25.017 --> 02:05:27.419
THAT SUNRISE IS ABOUT TO OCCUR.

02:05:27.486 --> 02:05:30.723
AND WHAT THIS BILL DOES, IS IT

02:05:30.789 --> 02:05:32.925
BASICALLY EXEMPTS CIVIL MATTERS,

02:05:32.992 --> 02:05:35.427
EXCEPT FOR IN A FAIRLY BROAD

02:05:35.494 --> 02:05:37.897
CLASS OF ACTIONS, ACTIONS THAT

02:05:37.963 --> 02:05:40.799
RELATE TO ISSUES CONCERNING

02:05:40.866 --> 02:05:42.768
DISCRIMINATION BASED ON SOME OF

02:05:42.835 --> 02:05:44.436
THE CRITERIA I MENTIONED BEFORE,

02:05:44.503 --> 02:05:45.838
WHETHER IT'S RACE OR DISABILITY

02:05:45.905 --> 02:05:48.007
OR RELIGION, THAT KIND OF THING.

02:05:48.073 --> 02:05:51.644
THEY ARE EXEMPT. IT'S A RATHER

02:05:51.710 --> 02:05:53.078
COMPLICATED PROCESS NOW THAT

02:05:53.145 --> 02:05:55.915
EXISTS IN LAW. THE PROCESS IS

02:05:55.981 --> 02:05:58.450
WHEN SOMEONE CHALLENGES ANOTHER

02:05:58.517 --> 02:06:00.019
JUROR. THE OTHER SIDE CAN

02:06:00.085 --> 02:06:01.620
OBJECT. IF THE OTHER SIDE

02:06:01.687 --> 02:06:03.923
OBJECTS AND SAYS, I THINK THAT

02:06:03.989 --> 02:06:05.024
COUNSEL WHO IS CHALLENGING THAT

02:06:05.090 --> 02:06:06.492
JUROR IS CHALLENGING IT, THAT

02:06:06.558 --> 02:06:08.394
JUROR FOR AN IMPROPER PURPOSE.

02:06:08.460 --> 02:06:11.397
THE BURDEN THEN SHIFTS TO THE

02:06:11.463 --> 02:06:12.631
SIDE THAT IS CHALLENGING THAT

02:06:12.698 --> 02:06:14.700
JUROR TO DEMONSTRATE IT'S NOT A

02:06:14.767 --> 02:06:15.868
SUBTERFUGE. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, IF

02:06:15.935 --> 02:06:17.236
YOU SAY, I'M CHALLENGING JUROR

02:06:17.303 --> 02:06:18.404
NUMBER THREE BECAUSE I THINK

02:06:18.470 --> 02:06:19.738
THEY LOOK LIKE THEY'RE SLEEPING,

02:06:19.805 --> 02:06:21.573
AND IT TURNS OUT THAT JUROR

02:06:21.640 --> 02:06:23.609
NUMBER THREE IS IN THAT ONE OF

02:06:23.676 --> 02:06:24.343
THOSE PROTECTED CLASSES, THEN

02:06:24.410 --> 02:06:26.645
THE COURT HAS AN INQUIRY AS TO

02:06:26.712 --> 02:06:27.613
WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S A

02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:29.481
SUBTERFUGE OR NOT, AND MUST FIND

02:06:29.548 --> 02:06:30.649
BY CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE

02:06:30.716 --> 02:06:32.418
THAT IT'S NOT A SUBTERFUGE WHICH

02:06:32.484 --> 02:06:34.420
IS REVIEWED DE NOVO BY THE COURT

02:06:34.486 --> 02:06:35.554
OF APPEAL. I REALIZE THAT THAT'S

02:06:35.621 --> 02:06:38.457
A VERY CHALLENGING PROCESS. I

02:06:38.524 --> 02:06:40.659
PERSONALLY, AND I KNOW THE CHAIR

02:06:40.726 --> 02:06:41.927
IS FAMILIAR PEREMPTORY

02:06:41.994 --> 02:06:43.762
CHALLENGES. I PERSONALLY BELIEVE

02:06:43.829 --> 02:06:45.331
I'M AN EXPERT WITH RESPECT TO

02:06:45.397 --> 02:06:47.032
PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES, JUST LIKE

02:06:47.099 --> 02:06:48.467
EVERY PERSON WHO'S EVER TRIED A

02:06:48.534 --> 02:06:50.336
CASE. BUT I'M ALMOST ALWAYS

02:06:50.402 --> 02:06:53.505
WRONG. SO PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES.

02:06:53.572 --> 02:06:56.108
I THINK IF I HAD MY WAY, THEY

02:06:56.175 --> 02:06:56.875
WOULD BE COMPLETELY ELIMINATED

02:06:56.942 --> 02:06:59.445
IN CALIFORNIA. BUT I DON'T HAVE

02:06:59.511 --> 02:07:01.380
MY WAY. AND SO THUS WE HAVE THIS

02:07:01.447 --> 02:07:03.048
WE HAVE THIS BILL. MANY OTHER

02:07:03.115 --> 02:07:03.983
STATES ACTUALLY DO ELIMINATE

02:07:04.049 --> 02:07:05.050
PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES BECAUSE

02:07:05.117 --> 02:07:07.987
THEIR HISTORY IS ONE OF SEVERE

02:07:08.053 --> 02:07:09.621
BIAS AND DISCRIMINATION. THEY'VE

02:07:09.688 --> 02:07:11.857
BEEN USED FOR IMPROPER PURPOSES,

02:07:11.924 --> 02:07:13.692
AND I BELIEVE THEY'RE SIMPLY

02:07:13.759 --> 02:07:16.228
BORN OF BIAS AND PREJUDICE. BUT

02:07:16.295 --> 02:07:17.563
NEVERTHELESS, WE HAVE THIS BILL

02:07:17.629 --> 02:07:20.599
BEFORE US TODAY. WITH ME TO

02:07:20.666 --> 02:07:24.570
TESTIFY IS AGAIN, MISS TAKHAR

02:07:24.636 --> 02:07:27.172
FROM THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF

02:07:27.239 --> 02:07:29.575
CALIFORNIA. AND I ALSO SEE MR.

02:07:29.641 --> 02:07:31.076
BELOTE HERE. SO ONCE AGAIN, WE

02:07:31.143 --> 02:07:32.811
HAVE THE DEFENSE COUNSEL AND

02:07:32.878 --> 02:07:34.313
CONSUMER ATTORNEYS IS GETTING TO

02:07:34.380 --> 02:07:36.415
BE SOMEWHAT OF A PATTERN. SO

02:07:36.482 --> 02:07:39.284
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. SABINA

02:07:39.351 --> 02:07:40.786
TUCKER, THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS

02:07:40.853 --> 02:07:41.820
OF CALIFORNIA HERE IS A PROUD

02:07:41.887 --> 02:07:44.056
CO-SPONSOR OF SB 645. WE THANK

02:07:44.123 --> 02:07:45.391
THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR

02:07:45.457 --> 02:07:46.692
ANALYSIS. WE ALSO WANT TO THANK

02:07:46.759 --> 02:07:48.694
THE SECRETARY OF STATE, THE

02:07:48.761 --> 02:07:50.229
CRIMINAL DEFENSE LAWYERS AND

02:07:50.295 --> 02:07:51.830
OTHER STAKEHOLDERS FOR THEIR

02:07:51.897 --> 02:07:53.465
ENGAGEMENT. THE BILL THAT YOU

02:07:53.532 --> 02:07:56.001
SEE BEFORE YOU TODAY IS A RESULT

02:07:56.068 --> 02:07:57.302
OF MONTHS OF COLLABORATION, AS

02:07:57.369 --> 02:07:59.405
REFLECTED IN ANALYSIS AS WE. 645

02:07:59.471 --> 02:08:01.140
STRIKES A CAREFUL BALANCE. IT

02:08:01.206 --> 02:08:02.641
RECOGNIZES THAT WHILE PEREMPTORY

02:08:02.708 --> 02:08:05.277
CHALLENGES MUST BE SCRUTINIZED

02:08:05.344 --> 02:08:07.079
IN CASES, IMPLEMENTING CLASSES

02:08:07.146 --> 02:08:08.447
IN CIVIL RIGHTS, SUCH AS FOR

02:08:08.514 --> 02:08:10.215
HATE CRIMES AND DEPENDENCY

02:08:10.282 --> 02:08:11.817
MATTERS, THE PROCEDURES ARE NOT

02:08:11.884 --> 02:08:12.951
NECESSARILY WELL SUITED FOR ALL

02:08:13.018 --> 02:08:14.486
OF CIVIL CASES. SO WE BELIEVE

02:08:14.553 --> 02:08:16.789
THIS BILL EXPANDING TO THOSE

02:08:16.855 --> 02:08:17.623
CATEGORIES MAKES THE MOST SENSE

02:08:17.689 --> 02:08:21.060
AT THIS TIME. WE WILL CONTINUE

02:08:21.126 --> 02:08:22.227
TO WORK WITH OTHER STAKEHOLDERS

02:08:22.294 --> 02:08:25.030
AS NEEDED. WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN ANY

02:08:25.097 --> 02:08:26.398
CONCRETE ANSWER BACK FROM THE

02:08:26.465 --> 02:08:27.266
SECRETARY OF STATE WHETHER THEIR

02:08:27.332 --> 02:08:28.467
OPPOSITION IS FULLY REMOVED, BUT

02:08:28.534 --> 02:08:30.302
THEY WERE OPPOSED TO THE PRIOR

02:08:30.369 --> 02:08:31.670
BILL, AND WE HAVE SINCE ADDED

02:08:31.737 --> 02:08:32.805
EVERY SINGLE CATEGORY THAT THEY

02:08:32.871 --> 02:08:35.774
ASKED FOR. SO WE BELIEVE THAT

02:08:35.841 --> 02:08:36.408
WE'VE SATISFIED THEIR CONCERNS,

02:08:36.475 --> 02:08:36.975
BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE

02:08:37.042 --> 02:08:38.544
WORKING ON THE BILL. THANK YOU,

02:08:38.610 --> 02:08:40.279
MR. CHAIR. PARDON ME, MR. CHAIR

02:08:40.345 --> 02:08:41.914
AND MEMBERS, MIKE, FOR THE

02:08:41.980 --> 02:08:43.115
CALIFORNIA DEFENSE COUNSEL, AS

02:08:43.182 --> 02:08:44.750
YOU MAY HAVE INTIMATED FROM

02:08:44.817 --> 02:08:46.085
SENATOR ELLENBERG'S COMMENTS,

02:08:46.151 --> 02:08:47.953
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE 250,000

02:08:48.020 --> 02:08:49.455
LAWYERS IN CALIFORNIA AND

02:08:49.521 --> 02:08:51.323
ANOTHER COUPLE THOUSAND JUDGES.

02:08:51.390 --> 02:08:52.758
AND THERE'S ABOUT THAT MANY

02:08:52.825 --> 02:08:54.593
OPINIONS ABOUT PEREMPTORY

02:08:54.660 --> 02:08:56.628
CHALLENGES. THESE ARE DEBATED

02:08:56.695 --> 02:08:58.097
YEAR AFTER YEAR. THEY WILL BE

02:08:58.163 --> 02:08:59.598
FOR THE BALANCE OF MY CAREER AND

02:08:59.665 --> 02:09:01.400
YOUR CAREER HERE IN THE

02:09:01.467 --> 02:09:02.468
LEGISLATURE. THERE ARE THOSE WHO

02:09:02.534 --> 02:09:04.770
WHO WANT TO GET RID OF THEM

02:09:04.837 --> 02:09:08.540
ENTIRELY AS AS SENATOR UMBERG.

02:09:08.607 --> 02:09:10.976
MENTIONED, THIS IS A COMPROMISE.

02:09:11.043 --> 02:09:14.279
THE IN OUR VIEW, THE HISTORY OF

02:09:14.346 --> 02:09:17.216
THE BATTS AND WHEELER CHALLENGES

02:09:17.282 --> 02:09:19.751
IS ALMOST ENTIRELY ONE OF

02:09:19.818 --> 02:09:21.520
CRIMINAL CASES. AND THAT WAS

02:09:21.587 --> 02:09:23.021
REFLECTED IN THE ANALYSIS YOU

02:09:23.088 --> 02:09:25.858
HAVE TODAY. ON THE OTHER HAND,

02:09:25.924 --> 02:09:26.892
THERE ARE SENSITIVE CASES

02:09:26.959 --> 02:09:29.128
INVOLVING DISCRIMINATION AGAINST

02:09:29.194 --> 02:09:33.699
PROTECTED CLASSES. AND SO THE

02:09:33.765 --> 02:09:36.201
COMPROMISE IS THOSE CASES WILL

02:09:36.268 --> 02:09:39.905
BE BROUGHT WITHIN THE AMBIT OF

02:09:39.972 --> 02:09:42.441
ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBBER'S BILL AB

02:09:42.508 --> 02:09:44.309
3070 FROM SEVERAL YEARS AGO. BUT

02:09:44.376 --> 02:09:46.845
IF YOU HAVE A GENERAL SLIP AND

02:09:46.912 --> 02:09:48.213
FALL CASE, WE WILL CONTINUE TO

02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:50.682
USE BATSON AND WHEELER

02:09:50.749 --> 02:09:53.285
CHALLENGES TO PREVENT BIAS IN

02:09:53.352 --> 02:09:55.320
JURORS. AND LIKE I SAY, THE

02:09:55.387 --> 02:09:56.788
DEBATE WILL CONTINUE, BUT WE

02:09:56.855 --> 02:09:59.424
THINK IT'S A FAIR COMPROMISE

02:09:59.491 --> 02:10:02.161
THAT DOESN'T UPEND JURY

02:10:02.227 --> 02:10:04.029
SELECTION IN GENERAL CIVIL

02:10:04.096 --> 02:10:05.831
CASES, BUT RECOGNIZES THE

02:10:05.898 --> 02:10:07.332
SENSITIVE NATURE OF SOME OF

02:10:07.399 --> 02:10:09.501
THESE DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS. SO

02:10:09.568 --> 02:10:11.570
WE WOULD ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

02:10:11.637 --> 02:10:13.038
THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE

02:10:13.105 --> 02:10:21.246
HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB 645? IS

02:10:21.313 --> 02:10:24.683

02:10:44.336 --> 02:10:45.771
WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE DA'S

PLANE, BUT WE'RE DEFINITELY MUCH

02:10:52.644 --> 02:10:54.046
CLOSER. SO WE'LL CONTINUE TO

ENGAGED ON THAT. ALSO, I'VE BEEN

FROM SECRETARY OF STATE'S

02:11:06.625 --> 02:11:07.426

ANOTHER MEETING RIGHT NOW, AND

02:11:09.194 --> 02:11:10.862
THEY ARE IN THE SAME PLACE WHERE

02:11:10.929 --> 02:11:12.631
MUCH CLOSER. WE'RE NOT QUITE

02:11:12.698 --> 02:11:14.233
THERE YET, BUT I DO WANT TO

THANK THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS

02:11:16.134 --> 02:11:17.469

02:11:17.536 --> 02:11:20.205
ONGOING DISCUSSIONS, AND HAPPY

02:11:20.272 --> 02:11:21.540
TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. IF ANY

02:11:21.607 --> 02:11:23.508
OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE.

02:11:23.575 --> 02:11:25.811
THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE

02:11:25.877 --> 02:11:28.714
IN OPPOSITION? SB 645. I'LL

02:11:28.780 --> 02:11:30.749
BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE.

02:11:30.816 --> 02:11:33.518
ANY QUESTIONS? COMMENTS, MOTIONS

02:11:33.585 --> 02:11:36.054
WE HAVE WE HAVE A MOTION AND A

02:11:36.121 --> 02:11:38.257
SECOND. ANY COMMENTS OR

02:11:38.323 --> 02:11:42.628
QUESTIONS? I, I WAS WHEN I

02:11:42.694 --> 02:11:43.895
AUTHORED THE RACIAL JUSTICE ACT.

02:11:43.962 --> 02:11:45.464
IT WAS DONE SOMEWHAT IN

02:11:45.530 --> 02:11:47.332
PARALLEL. THE SECRETARY WEBBER'S

02:11:47.399 --> 02:11:51.103
BILL, BECAUSE MY, MY BILL ALSO

02:11:51.169 --> 02:11:52.371
HAD PROVISIONS REGARDING JURY

02:11:52.437 --> 02:11:53.572
SELECTION, BUT HERS WERE FAR

02:11:53.639 --> 02:11:56.875
MORE DETAILED. AND SO I WAS KIND

02:11:56.942 --> 02:11:58.543
OF DEFERRED. IF THAT BILL

02:11:58.610 --> 02:12:00.112
PASSED, IF IT DIDN'T, THEN IT

02:12:00.178 --> 02:12:01.613
WOULD KIND OF RACIAL JUSTICE ACT

02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:03.615
WOULD BE A FALLBACK. AND SO IT

02:12:03.682 --> 02:12:05.317
WAS HISTORIC WHEN THAT BILL WAS

02:12:05.384 --> 02:12:08.920
PASSED REGARDING CRIMINAL CASES,

02:12:08.987 --> 02:12:12.524
I ALSO BELIEVE THAT BIAS,

02:12:12.591 --> 02:12:13.925
IMPLICIT BIAS, AND RACIAL BIAS

02:12:13.992 --> 02:12:15.727
PLAYS A ROLE IN EVERY ASPECT OF

02:12:15.794 --> 02:12:17.129
OUR SOCIETY, WHETHER IT'S A

02:12:17.195 --> 02:12:19.398
CIVIL RIGHTS CASE OR NOT. I

02:12:19.464 --> 02:12:21.466
THINK THAT IT COULD BE A, YOU

02:12:21.533 --> 02:12:23.969
KNOW, A SLIP AND FALL COULD BE A

02:12:24.036 --> 02:12:25.570
MEDICAL MALPRACTICE RACE, IS A

02:12:25.637 --> 02:12:28.307
RACE HAS A WAY OVER THE

02:12:28.373 --> 02:12:30.142
GENERATIONS INFECTING EVERY

02:12:30.208 --> 02:12:32.044
ASPECT OF DECISION MAKING,

02:12:32.110 --> 02:12:33.111
WHETHER IT'S CONSCIOUS OR NOT.

02:12:33.178 --> 02:12:35.681
AND THAT WAS THE ASPECT OF THE

02:12:35.747 --> 02:12:36.214
RACIAL JUSTICE ACT WAS IT

02:12:36.281 --> 02:12:37.382
DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S CONSCIOUS

02:12:37.449 --> 02:12:39.918
OR NOT, IT'S IMPLICIT BIAS. THAT

02:12:39.985 --> 02:12:40.886
BEING SAID, I REALLY APPRECIATE

02:12:40.952 --> 02:12:43.488
AND UNDERSTAND CONCERNS OF THE

02:12:43.555 --> 02:12:44.823
BROADER APPLICATION OF IT,

02:12:44.890 --> 02:12:46.425
PARTICULARLY AS IT APPLIES TO

02:12:46.491 --> 02:12:47.426
THE WAY JURY SELECTION IS

02:12:47.492 --> 02:12:49.227
CURRENTLY DONE IN CIVIL CASES.

02:12:49.294 --> 02:12:52.164
AND SO THE NARROWING IT TO CIVIL

02:12:52.230 --> 02:12:53.965
RIGHTS CASES, WHERE IT'S VERY

02:12:54.032 --> 02:12:55.434
EXPLICITLY INVOLVES CATEGORIES

02:12:55.500 --> 02:12:57.202
THAT WE WANT TO BE MORE

02:12:57.269 --> 02:12:58.603
COGNIZANT ABOUT AND MORE

02:12:58.670 --> 02:13:00.339
PROTECTIVE OF, WHOLLY UNDERSTAND

02:13:00.405 --> 02:13:02.341
THAT AND JUST WOULD ASK YOU TO

02:15:16.475 --> 02:15:18.343

02:15:31.623 --> 02:15:33.658
THIS. THESE AMENDMENTS HAVE

02:15:33.725 --> 02:15:36.161
MOVED EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS, OUR

02:15:36.228 --> 02:15:37.696

CHAMBERS COALITION TO NEUTRAL

INSTEAD OF OPPOSITION TO THIS

02:15:41.733 --> 02:15:44.202
BILL. SO THE GOAL OF THIS BILL

02:15:44.269 --> 02:15:45.537
IS SIMPLE. IT'S TO PROTECT THE

02:15:45.604 --> 02:15:47.806
SPACE FOR MEANINGFUL ANTI-BIAS

02:15:47.873 --> 02:15:49.841
WORK WHILE ENSURING REAL

02:15:49.908 --> 02:15:51.977
MISCONDUCT IS STILL INVESTIGATED

02:15:52.043 --> 02:15:53.111
AND ADDRESSED THROUGH PROPER

02:15:53.178 --> 02:15:55.347
LEGAL OR DISCIPLINARY CHANNELS.

02:15:55.413 --> 02:15:56.815
PUBLIC AGENCIES ARE REQUIRED BY

02:15:56.882 --> 02:15:58.817
STATE AND FEDERAL LAW TO PREVENT

02:15:58.884 --> 02:16:00.685
AND CORRECT WORKPLACE

02:16:00.752 --> 02:16:01.286
DISCRIMINATION, OFTEN THROUGH

02:16:01.353 --> 02:16:03.889
BIAS MITIGATION AND

02:16:03.955 --> 02:16:05.390
ANTI-DISCRIMINATION PROGRAMS,

02:16:05.457 --> 02:16:07.225
BUT THESE EFFORTS FACE

02:16:07.292 --> 02:16:08.927
CHALLENGES FOR WORKERS.

02:16:08.994 --> 02:16:09.961
PARTICIPATION IN THESE PROGRAMS

02:16:10.028 --> 02:16:12.697
CAN FEEL RISKY WITHOUT LEGAL

02:16:12.764 --> 02:16:15.133
SAFEGUARDS. THEY MAY HESITATE TO

02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:16.535
ENGAGE OPENLY AND HONESTLY OUT

02:16:16.601 --> 02:16:18.837
OF THEIR FEAR THAT THEIR WORDS

02:16:18.904 --> 02:16:20.605
AND ACTIONS COULD BE USED

02:16:20.672 --> 02:16:22.474
AGAINST THEM. THE RESULT IS

02:16:22.541 --> 02:16:24.509
THESE PROGRAMS THAT ARE AIMED AT

02:16:24.576 --> 02:16:26.344
IDENTIFYING AND ADDRESSING BIAS

02:16:26.411 --> 02:16:28.113
COULD BE UNDERCUT BEFORE THEY

02:16:28.179 --> 02:16:30.649
CAN EVEN SUCCEED, AND WE CANNOT

02:16:30.715 --> 02:16:32.551
ELIMINATE BIAS IF WE DO NOT KNOW

02:16:32.617 --> 02:16:34.519
THAT THEY EXIST, AND HAVE A

02:16:34.586 --> 02:16:36.087
PROCESS BY WHICH WE CAN

02:16:36.154 --> 02:16:38.189
INTERROGATE AND PROVIDE TOOLS TO

02:16:38.256 --> 02:16:41.426
HELP OUR EMPLOYEES ADDRESS THESE

02:16:41.493 --> 02:16:43.595
ISSUES. BIAS ELIMINATION EFFORTS

02:16:43.662 --> 02:16:46.031
ARE PROVEN TOOL TO IDENTIFY AND

02:16:46.097 --> 02:16:47.832
TO CREATE SAFER WORKSPACES. AND

02:16:47.899 --> 02:16:50.135
AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STEPS

02:16:50.201 --> 02:16:53.305
AWAY FROM ANTI-DISCRIMINATION

02:16:53.371 --> 02:16:55.173
ENFORCEMENT, FROM AFFIRMATIVE

02:16:55.240 --> 02:16:57.309
ACTION THAT INCLUDES DIVERSITY

02:16:57.375 --> 02:16:59.311
FROM DEI INITIATIVES, IT IS EVEN

02:16:59.377 --> 02:17:01.146
MORE CRUCIAL THAT OUR STATE

02:17:01.212 --> 02:17:03.315
AGENCIES INCLUDE THE NECESSARY

02:17:03.381 --> 02:17:06.651
SAFEGUARDS THAT EMPLOY ANTI-BIAS

02:17:06.718 --> 02:17:08.720
TRAININGS TO WORK. AND LET ME BE

02:17:08.787 --> 02:17:10.555
CLEAR, THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS

02:17:10.622 --> 02:17:11.990
NOT TO SHIELD EMPLOYEES FROM

02:17:12.057 --> 02:17:13.158
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR

02:17:13.224 --> 02:17:15.327
DISCRIMINATORY ACTION FOR THEIR

02:17:15.393 --> 02:17:16.761
DISCRIMINATORY SPEECH, OR FOR

02:17:16.828 --> 02:17:18.163
SHARING AN INTENT TO

02:17:18.229 --> 02:17:19.531
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THEIR PEERS

02:17:19.598 --> 02:17:22.867
AND EMPLOYEES. DESPITE OUR BEST

02:17:22.934 --> 02:17:24.669
EFFORTS, HATE IS ON THE RISE IN

02:17:24.736 --> 02:17:26.438
THIS STATE, AND THAT IS WHAT

02:17:26.504 --> 02:17:28.607
THIS BILL IS ADDRESSING. IT IS

02:17:28.673 --> 02:17:30.709
ADDRESSING THE NEED FOR TOOLS

02:17:30.775 --> 02:17:32.877
LIKE ANTI-BIAS TRAININGS, TOOLS

02:17:32.944 --> 02:17:34.646
THAT WORK, TOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN

02:17:34.713 --> 02:17:35.780
VETTED, TOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN

02:17:35.847 --> 02:17:37.616
ADOPTED BY THIS LEGISLATURE, AND

02:17:37.682 --> 02:17:40.518
SB 303 HELPS MAKE THAT POSSIBLE.

02:17:40.585 --> 02:17:42.153

REDUCE THE IMPACTS OF BIAS IN

02:18:00.338 --> 02:18:01.640
EMPLOYMENT. THIS BILL WILL HELP

US FOSTER TRAINING AND WORKPLACE

02:18:03.308 --> 02:18:04.175
ENVIRONMENTS, WHERE EMPLOYEES

02:18:04.242 --> 02:18:06.011
CAN TAKE ACTION TO MITIGATE THE

02:18:06.077 --> 02:18:08.079
ROLE THAT BIAS PLAYS IN THE

02:18:13.818 --> 02:18:15.520
LINE IS THIS WE HAVE A DUTY TO

DISCRIMINATION. IN OUR WORK, I

02:18:28.433 --> 02:18:30.035
HAVE SEEN FIRSTHAND HOW SAFE

02:18:30.101 --> 02:18:31.836
SPACES FOR SELF-DISCOVERY AND

02:18:31.903 --> 02:18:33.338
INTROSPECTION CAN MAKE IT

02:18:33.405 --> 02:18:34.839
POSSIBLE FOR EMPLOYEES TO

02:18:34.906 --> 02:18:36.875
UNDERSTAND HOW THEIR PERSONAL

02:18:36.941 --> 02:18:38.376
BIAS MIGHT INFLUENCE THEIR OWN

02:18:38.443 --> 02:18:40.679
DECISION MAKING AND ACTION, AND

02:18:40.745 --> 02:18:42.380
THIS, IN TURN, MAKES IT POSSIBLE

02:18:42.447 --> 02:18:43.581
FOR EMPLOYERS TO IDENTIFY POINTS

02:18:43.648 --> 02:18:45.583
OF INTERVENTION, INCLUDING

02:18:45.650 --> 02:18:47.419
CUSTOMIZED TRAINING OR RESOURCES

FOR EMPLOYEES THAT CAN FOSTER A

02:18:49.054 --> 02:18:50.021
MORE POSITIVE WORKPLACE CULTURE

02:18:50.088 --> 02:18:51.823
AND REDUCE THE PROPENSITY FOR

02:18:51.890 --> 02:18:53.591
INSTANCES OF UNLAWFUL

02:18:53.658 --> 02:18:55.160
DISCRIMINATION. SINCE INITIATING

02:18:55.226 --> 02:18:57.062
SB 303, WE HAVE COLLABORATED

02:18:57.128 --> 02:18:58.229
WITH VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS TO

ADDRESS THE CONCERNS AND

02:18:59.698 --> 02:19:01.866
STRENGTHEN THE LEGISLATION.

02:19:01.933 --> 02:19:03.201
IMPORTANTLY, WE HAVE WORKED TO

02:19:03.268 --> 02:19:05.170
CLARIFY THE SCOPE OF SB 303,

02:19:05.236 --> 02:19:06.371
WHICH HAS INCLUDED RELOCATING

02:19:06.438 --> 02:19:08.139
THE TEXT OF THE FIRE AND

02:19:08.206 --> 02:19:09.474
EXPANDING THE LAW TO APPLY TO

02:19:09.541 --> 02:19:11.242
ALL EMPLOYERS IN THE STATE. THE

BILL IS NOT INTENDED TO APPLY TO

02:19:12.677 --> 02:19:13.645
SITUATIONS WHERE AN EMPLOYEE

DISCRIMINATION, OR RETALIATION

02:19:18.416 --> 02:19:19.718
DURING A BIAS MITIGATION

02:19:19.784 --> 02:19:21.586
TRAINING. NOR IS IT TO PREVENT

02:19:21.653 --> 02:19:22.921
AN EMPLOYER FROM ADDRESSING

02:19:22.987 --> 02:19:24.422
UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION OR

02:19:24.489 --> 02:19:27.025

REPRESENTS A CONCRETE STEP THAT

02:19:31.396 --> 02:19:33.431
THIS COMMITTEE CAN TAKE TO EQUIP

02:19:33.498 --> 02:19:35.366
EMPLOYERS WITH NEEDED TOOLS TO

PREVENT THE IMPACTS OF BIAS

02:19:36.901 --> 02:19:38.303
BEFORE THEY BECOME ACTIONABLE

02:19:38.369 --> 02:19:40.338
UNDER THE FIRE. FOR THESE

02:19:40.405 --> 02:19:41.506
REASONS, WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR

02:26:13.331 --> 02:26:13.931
ADVOCATES, I JUST WANT TO

02:26:13.998 --> 02:26:15.333
HIGHLIGHT A KIND OF KEY ISSUE

02:26:15.399 --> 02:26:16.567
THAT THIS BILL ADDRESSES, WHICH

02:26:16.634 --> 02:26:18.536
IS THE ISSUE OF OCCUPATIONAL

02:26:18.603 --> 02:26:19.871
SEGREGATION, WHICH KIND OF

02:26:19.937 --> 02:26:21.839
DESCRIBES THE ISSUE OF WOMEN AND

02:26:21.906 --> 02:26:22.607
PEOPLE OF COLOR BEING

02:26:22.673 --> 02:26:23.808
CONCENTRATED NOT ONLY IN LOWER

02:26:23.875 --> 02:26:25.810
PAYING FIELDS, BUT ALSO EVEN IN

02:26:25.877 --> 02:26:27.345
LOWER PAYING POSITIONS WITHIN

02:26:27.411 --> 02:26:28.346
COMPANIES OR IN THIS CASE,

02:26:28.412 --> 02:26:30.047
AGENCIES. SO FOR THAT REASON,

02:26:30.114 --> 02:26:31.315
ONE CRITICAL STRATEGY TO CLOSING

02:26:31.382 --> 02:26:33.251
THE WAGE GAP. SO OCCUPATIONAL

02:26:33.317 --> 02:26:34.252
SEGREGATION IS A MAJOR

02:26:34.318 --> 02:26:36.187
CONTRIBUTOR TO IT IS NOT ONLY

02:26:36.254 --> 02:26:36.754
FIGHTING FOR PAY EQUITY. SO

02:26:39.657 --> 02:26:41.626

MAKING SURE WOMEN, PEOPLE OF

02:26:45.196 --> 02:26:46.597
COLOR AND OTHERS ARE REPRESENTED

02:26:46.664 --> 02:26:48.232
AT ALL WAGE LEVELS. AS YOU HEARD

02:26:48.299 --> 02:26:49.534
FROM THE SENATOR, YOU CAN'T FIX

02:26:49.600 --> 02:26:51.402
WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE. AND BY

02:26:51.469 --> 02:26:52.670
PROVIDING A HIGH LEVEL VIEW OF

02:26:52.737 --> 02:26:54.172
THESE GROUPINGS OF WORKERS

02:26:54.238 --> 02:26:55.506
WITHIN AN AGENCY, THE PAY DATA

02:26:55.573 --> 02:26:56.607
REPORTS REALLY HELP TO BRING

02:26:56.674 --> 02:26:58.342
OUT, BRING INTO LIGHT PATTERNS

02:26:58.409 --> 02:26:59.877
AND INCENTIVIZE EMPLOYERS, IN

02:26:59.944 --> 02:27:01.646
THIS CASE AGENCIES, TO MAKE

02:27:01.712 --> 02:27:04.148
CHANGES WHEN NEEDED TO HIRING OR

02:27:04.215 --> 02:27:04.749

PEOPLE ARE REPRESENTED AT ALL

02:27:05.950 --> 02:27:07.518
WAGE LEVELS. WE KNOW THAT THIS

02:27:07.585 --> 02:27:09.220
KIND OF TRANSPARENCY WORKS.

02:27:09.287 --> 02:27:10.655
THERE ARE ALREADY MANY COMPANIES

02:27:10.721 --> 02:27:12.023
THAT HAVE CHOSEN TO VOLUNTARILY

02:27:12.089 --> 02:27:14.292
DISCLOSE THIS TYPE OF PAY DATA

02:27:14.358 --> 02:27:15.393
INFORMATION NOT IN SHAME, BUT TO

02:27:15.459 --> 02:27:17.461
SHOW, HEY, WE SEE THERE'S AN

02:27:17.528 --> 02:27:18.296
ISSUE. HERE'S WHAT WE'RE DOING

02:27:18.362 --> 02:27:20.097
TO TRY TO BETTER REPRESENT

02:27:20.164 --> 02:27:21.599
PEOPLE AT ALL LEVELS. THE STATE

02:27:21.666 --> 02:27:22.466
WORKER CENSUS, RELEASED LAST

02:27:22.533 --> 02:27:23.301
DECEMBER, CONFIRMED THE GENDER

02:27:23.367 --> 02:27:25.069
WAGE GAP FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES IN

CALIFORNIA REMAINS WIDE, WITH A

02:27:26.971 --> 02:27:28.439
NEARLY $14,000 DIFFERENCE

02:27:28.506 --> 02:27:30.074
BETWEEN EACH GENDERS MEDIAN

02:27:30.141 --> 02:27:30.942
SALARY, AND THAT WAS AN INCREASE

02:27:31.008 --> 02:27:32.577
FROM PREVIOUS YEARS. AND THE

02:27:32.643 --> 02:27:34.712
CENSUS REPORT NOTED THAT ONE OF

02:27:34.779 --> 02:27:35.846
THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR THAT GAP

02:27:35.913 --> 02:27:37.181
IS BECAUSE MEN HOLD HIGHER

02:27:37.248 --> 02:27:38.649
PAYING POSITIONS THAN WOMEN.

02:27:38.716 --> 02:27:40.184

AND HOPEFULLY ENSURE BETTER

02:27:46.224 --> 02:27:47.291
ACCOUNTABILITY. FOR THOSE

MORNING. I'M HONORED TO BE HERE

02:31:19.470 --> 02:31:20.271
WITH MY PRINCIPAL CO-CHAIR,

02:31:20.337 --> 02:31:23.274
PILAR SHAVANO, AND I THANK HER

02:31:23.340 --> 02:31:26.977

02:31:27.044 --> 02:31:28.712
I WOULD JUST LIKE TO BEGIN BY

02:31:28.779 --> 02:31:30.548

LOVING AND CARING FOR OUR

02:31:34.585 --> 02:31:36.353
POINT OUT THAT I'VE GOT TWO THAT

02:31:36.420 --> 02:31:38.422
ARE SERVING. BOTH MY SONS ARE

02:31:38.489 --> 02:31:39.824
WEST POINT GRADUATES, AND

02:31:39.890 --> 02:31:41.692
THEY'RE SERVING RIGHT NOW, AND I

02:31:41.759 --> 02:31:43.427
THINK I'M THE ONLY SENATOR IN

02:31:43.494 --> 02:31:44.728
AMERICA THAT HAS TWO WEST

02:31:44.795 --> 02:31:46.397
POINTERS THAT ARE STILL SERVING,

02:31:46.464 --> 02:31:47.331
ONE WHO GRADUATED FROM WEST

02:31:47.398 --> 02:31:49.467
POINT AS A PRESIDENT AND THE

02:31:49.533 --> 02:31:50.367
OTHER IS VICE PRESIDENT. SO I

02:31:50.434 --> 02:31:51.769
THINK THE ARCHULETA HAS DONE

02:31:51.836 --> 02:31:53.971
WELL. AND I HAD THE HONOR TO

02:31:54.038 --> 02:31:56.207
SERVE PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA TO

02:31:56.273 --> 02:31:57.908
THE BOARD OF VISITORS, LIKE THE

02:31:57.975 --> 02:31:59.710
BOARD OF TRUSTEES THERE AT WEST

02:31:59.777 --> 02:32:02.279
POINT REPRESENTING THEM. AND I

02:32:02.346 --> 02:32:05.082
HAD THE HONOR TO SERVE AS THE LA

02:32:05.149 --> 02:32:06.150
COUNTY COMMISSIONER OF MILITARY

02:32:06.217 --> 02:32:08.085
AND VETERANS AFFAIRS FOR 24

02:32:08.152 --> 02:32:10.521
YEARS, FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS

02:32:10.588 --> 02:32:12.289
ANGELES, AND SERVING WITH

02:32:12.356 --> 02:32:14.792
EDELMAN AND GLORIA MOLINA AND

02:32:14.859 --> 02:32:17.294
MANY OUTSTANDING MEN AND WOMEN

02:32:17.361 --> 02:32:18.729
REPRESENTING COUNTY OF LOS

02:32:18.796 --> 02:32:20.664
ANGELES. SO I HAVE A LONG

02:32:20.731 --> 02:32:22.366
HISTORY OF SERVING OUR VETERANS

02:32:22.433 --> 02:32:24.201
AND REPRESENTING THEM. AND AS A

02:32:24.268 --> 02:32:26.036
MATTER OF FACT, WHEN MY SON WAS

02:32:26.103 --> 02:32:28.339
BORN, IT WAS THE RED CROSS THAT

02:32:28.405 --> 02:32:30.207
SENT ME HOME ON EMERGENCY LEAVE.

02:32:30.274 --> 02:32:32.776
DIDN'T CHARGE ME A DIME. WHY?

02:32:32.843 --> 02:32:34.979
BECAUSE IT'S PART OF THE GROUP

02:32:35.045 --> 02:32:36.881
THAT ASSISTS VETERANS. AND WHEN

02:32:36.947 --> 02:32:38.582
I CAME HOME, I SERVED IN COMBAT

02:32:38.649 --> 02:32:40.417
WITH THE 82ND AIRBORNE. AND WHEN

02:32:40.484 --> 02:32:42.753
I CAME HOME AND I WENT DIRECTLY

02:32:42.820 --> 02:32:46.023
TO THE VA AND I WAS ABLE TO BE

02:32:46.090 --> 02:32:47.625
RECEIVED AND TAKEN CARE OF, AND

02:32:47.691 --> 02:32:49.693
I STILL CARRY MY VA CARD WITH ME

02:32:49.760 --> 02:32:52.196
IN MY WALLET, BECAUSE IT'S SO

02:32:52.263 --> 02:32:53.631
IMPORTANT THAT GOD FORBID I EVER

02:32:53.697 --> 02:32:55.366
NEED ANYTHING. ANYONE COULD JUST

02:32:55.432 --> 02:32:57.935
SEE THAT VA CARD AND I'LL HAVE

02:32:58.002 --> 02:32:59.136
MEDICAL BENEFITS AND EVERYTHING

02:32:59.203 --> 02:33:00.371
ELSE. SO I JUST WANTED TO POINT

02:33:00.437 --> 02:33:02.406
THAT OUT. AND AS CHAIR OF THE

02:33:02.473 --> 02:33:04.108
MILITARY AND VETERANS COMMITTEE,

02:33:04.174 --> 02:33:04.975
AGAIN, I'M HONORED TO BE HERE.

02:33:05.042 --> 02:33:08.479
SENATE BILL 694 STRENGTHENS

02:33:08.546 --> 02:33:09.847
CALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENT TO

02:33:09.914 --> 02:33:12.082
PROTECTING VETERANS FROM

02:33:12.149 --> 02:33:13.450
EXPLOITATION IN THE FEDERAL

02:33:13.517 --> 02:33:14.885
CLAIMS PROCESS. MORE

02:33:14.952 --> 02:33:17.154
IMPORTANTLY, IT REAFFIRMS OUR

02:33:17.221 --> 02:33:18.722
RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT

02:33:18.789 --> 02:33:21.058
VETERANS ARE NOT MISLED,

02:33:21.125 --> 02:33:22.860
MANIPULATED OR TAKEN ADVANTAGE

02:33:22.927 --> 02:33:24.929
WHEN SEEKING THE BENEFITS THEY

02:33:24.995 --> 02:33:26.830
HAVE EARNED THROUGH MILITARY

02:33:26.897 --> 02:33:28.899
SERVICE. THE COMMITTEE'S

02:33:28.966 --> 02:33:30.701
ANALYSIS DESCRIBES THE CURRENT

02:33:30.768 --> 02:33:33.203
SYSTEM OF VA ACCREDITATION, THE

02:33:33.270 --> 02:33:35.472
PUBLIC POLICY PURPOSE OF

02:33:35.539 --> 02:33:36.373
ACCREDITATION, AND HIGHLIGHTING

02:33:36.440 --> 02:33:38.909
THE FEDERAL LAW THAT GENERALLY

02:33:38.976 --> 02:33:41.145
REQUIRES SOMEONE TO BE A VA

02:33:41.211 --> 02:33:43.247
ACCREDITED IN ORDER TO ASSIST A

02:33:43.314 --> 02:33:44.748
CLAIMANT IN PREPARING,

02:33:44.815 --> 02:33:46.216
PRESENTING AND PROSECUTING A

02:33:46.283 --> 02:33:48.752
CLAIM FOR VA BENEFITS. THIS

02:33:48.819 --> 02:33:51.555
FEDERAL LAW REQUIRING

02:33:51.622 --> 02:33:52.623
ACCREDITATION IS THE

02:33:52.690 --> 02:33:54.491
UNDERPINNING OF THIS BILL. THE

02:33:54.558 --> 02:33:57.828
KEY PRINCIPLE THAT MANY MILITARY

02:33:57.895 --> 02:33:59.563
AND VETERANS GROUPS THAT SUPPORT

02:33:59.630 --> 02:34:02.066
THIS BILL SEEK TO UPHOLD. IN

02:34:02.132 --> 02:34:04.134
CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIA LAW,

02:34:04.201 --> 02:34:06.770
NAMELY, THAT CHARGING A FEE FOR

02:34:06.837 --> 02:34:08.439
PREPARATION OR ASSISTANCE WITH

02:34:08.505 --> 02:34:10.307
VETERANS BENEFITS CLAIMS SHOULD

02:34:10.374 --> 02:34:11.675
APPROPRIATELY BE RESERVED TO

02:34:11.742 --> 02:34:14.144
THOSE AUTHORIZED UNDER FEDERAL

02:34:14.211 --> 02:34:16.046
LAW TO DO SO. SPECIFICALLY,

02:34:16.113 --> 02:34:18.482
THOSE WHO ARE VA ACCREDITED.

02:34:18.549 --> 02:34:22.219
SINCE 2006, WE HAVE SEEN THE

02:34:22.286 --> 02:34:25.422
EXPLOITATION OF A NEW INDUSTRY

02:34:25.489 --> 02:34:27.324
OF BUSINESSES THAT CHARGE

02:34:27.391 --> 02:34:29.360
VETERANS FOR ASSISTANCE WITH

02:34:29.426 --> 02:34:31.562
BENEFITS CLAIMS WITHOUT BEING

02:34:31.629 --> 02:34:33.664
ACCREDITED. IT IS THE LACK OF

02:34:33.731 --> 02:34:35.432
INSTITUTIONAL OVERSIGHT OVER

02:34:35.499 --> 02:34:37.401
THESE UNACCREDITED ACTORS. THAT

02:34:37.468 --> 02:34:39.837
IS THE CRUX OF THE PROBLEM THAT

02:34:39.903 --> 02:34:42.306
THIS BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS. THE

02:34:42.373 --> 02:34:44.441
CHAIR OF THE OVERSIGHT

02:34:44.508 --> 02:34:45.609
INVESTIGATION SUBCOMMITTEE IN

02:34:45.676 --> 02:34:47.344
THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON VETERANS

AFFAIRS, REPRESENTATIVE CHRIS

02:34:49.980 --> 02:34:52.449
PAPPAS, EXPLAINED IN THIS WAY

02:34:52.516 --> 02:34:54.518
THAT IN RECENT CONGRESSIONAL

02:34:54.585 --> 02:34:56.320
HEARINGS, SOME VETERANS MAY BE

02:34:56.387 --> 02:34:58.622
WILLING TO PAY A FEE IF THE

02:34:58.689 --> 02:35:00.724
SERVICES THEY RECEIVE ARE

02:35:00.791 --> 02:35:02.960
WORTHWHILE AND A COMPANY'S

02:35:03.027 --> 02:35:05.095
BUSINESS PRACTICES ARE ABOVE

02:35:05.162 --> 02:35:07.598
BOARD, BUT WITHOUT ADEQUATE

02:35:07.665 --> 02:35:08.699
OVERSIGHT THROUGH THE

02:35:08.766 --> 02:35:10.801
ACCREDITATION PROCESS, WE CANNOT

02:35:10.868 --> 02:35:12.970
BE ASSURED THAT THIS IS

02:35:13.037 --> 02:35:15.172
HAPPENING. AS A PROUD VETERAN,

02:35:15.239 --> 02:35:17.374
AS I MENTIONED, AS THE CHAIR OF

02:35:17.441 --> 02:35:19.043
THE MILITARY COMMITTEE ON

02:35:19.109 --> 02:35:20.210
MILITARY AND VETERANS AFFAIRS

02:35:20.277 --> 02:35:22.613
AND A FATHER OF TWO ACTIVE DUTY

02:35:22.680 --> 02:35:24.882
PARATROOPERS, I DO ALL THIS TO

02:35:24.948 --> 02:35:25.916
PROTECT THEM AND TO PROTECT MY

02:35:25.983 --> 02:35:27.384
BROTHERS AND SISTERS WHO SERVED

02:35:27.451 --> 02:35:29.486
OUR GREAT COUNTRY, AND MAKE SURE

02:35:29.553 --> 02:35:31.622
THAT THEY'RE NOT EXPLOITED. THIS

02:35:31.689 --> 02:35:33.824
BILL WOULD ESTABLISH IN STATE

02:35:33.891 --> 02:35:36.393
LAW THE FEDERAL PROHIBITION IN

02:35:36.460 --> 02:35:37.728
PREPARING, PRESENTING, AND

02:35:37.795 --> 02:35:41.465
PROHIBITING AND ALSO PROSECUTING

02:35:41.532 --> 02:35:43.934
CLAIMS FOR BENEFITS UNLESS

02:35:44.001 --> 02:35:45.769
ACCREDITED PURSUANT TO FEDERAL

02:35:45.836 --> 02:35:47.871
LAW. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT

02:35:47.938 --> 02:35:49.773
FEDERAL LAW DOES NOT ALLOW FOR

02:35:49.840 --> 02:35:51.809
THE CHARGING OF FEES, EVEN FOR

02:35:51.875 --> 02:35:54.044
ACCREDITED AGENTS AND LAWYERS,

02:35:54.111 --> 02:35:55.779
FOR THE PREPARATION OF INITIAL

02:35:55.846 --> 02:35:57.848
CLAIMS OR BENEFITS, AND THIS

02:35:57.915 --> 02:36:00.084
BILL ADDRESSES THE FEDERAL LAW

02:36:00.150 --> 02:36:02.986
WITH RESPECT AND DIGNITY. THE

02:36:03.053 --> 02:36:05.456
BILL ALSO ESTABLISHES AND

02:36:05.522 --> 02:36:07.991
STRENGTHENS STATE LAW BY

02:36:08.058 --> 02:36:09.927
INCREASING PENALTIES FOR PERSONS

02:36:09.993 --> 02:36:12.629
THAT OBTAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS

02:36:12.696 --> 02:36:15.199
TO VETERANS. DATA ON VA COMPUTER

02:36:15.265 --> 02:36:17.668
SYSTEMS, WHICH IS A PRACTICE

02:36:17.735 --> 02:36:19.269
THAT UNSCRUPULOUS ACTORS OFTEN

02:36:19.336 --> 02:36:22.005
ENGAGE IN. IT WOULD ALSO

02:36:22.072 --> 02:36:23.574
PROHIBIT THE CHARGING OF FEES

02:36:23.640 --> 02:36:26.076
THAT EXCEED WHAT A VA ACCREDITED

02:36:26.143 --> 02:36:27.811
ATTORNEY OR CLAIMS AGENT COULD

02:36:27.878 --> 02:36:30.280
LEGALLY CHARGE TO ASSIST THESE

02:36:30.347 --> 02:36:32.549
VETERANS WITH THEIR CLAIMS,

02:36:32.616 --> 02:36:33.951
UNACCREDITED COMPANIES HAVE NO

FORMAL TRAINING IN THE VA SYSTEM

02:36:36.386 --> 02:36:38.956
AND OPERATE OUTSIDE FEDERAL LAW.

02:36:39.022 --> 02:36:40.858
THESE COMPANIES CHARGE A FEE FOR

02:36:40.924 --> 02:36:43.861
THEIR SERVICES EQUAL TO FIVE

02:36:43.927 --> 02:36:44.862
TIMES THE INCREASE OF THE

02:36:59.777 --> 02:37:01.445
HIS ENTIRE LIFE TO BE ABLE TO

02:37:01.512 --> 02:37:03.447
PAY HIS RENT, HIS CAR AND PUT

02:37:03.514 --> 02:37:05.983
FOOD ON THE TABLE. $3,800 PER

MONTH FOR FILING FOR HELP FILING

02:37:08.719 --> 02:37:10.621
THAT CLAIM, A CONSULTING COMPANY

02:37:10.687 --> 02:37:13.157
MIGHT CHARGE A ONE TIME FEE OF

02:37:13.223 --> 02:37:16.493
ABOUT $19,000, AND IN SOME

02:37:16.560 --> 02:37:17.961
CASES, CONSULTANTS CAN POCKET AS

02:37:18.028 --> 02:37:21.832
MUCH AS $30,000 THROUGH A TACTIC

02:37:21.899 --> 02:37:24.434
SUCH AS HOLDING ON TO THE CLAIM

02:37:24.501 --> 02:37:25.836
FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS BEFORE

02:37:25.903 --> 02:37:27.571
FILING. SO IT WILL ACCUMULATE.

02:37:27.638 --> 02:37:29.339
AND THEN WHEN IT FINALLY

02:37:29.406 --> 02:37:31.875
HAPPENS, THE PAY, THE BACK PAY

02:37:31.942 --> 02:37:34.545
WILL ACCUMULATE. AND REACHING

02:37:34.611 --> 02:37:37.014
THAT BENEFIT OF $30,000 FOR THAT

02:37:37.080 --> 02:37:40.217

02:37:42.452 --> 02:37:46.290

HAS FOR ACCREDITED SERVICES FOR

02:38:34.805 --> 02:38:37.174
OUR VETERANS. THIS BILL DOES NOT

02:38:37.241 --> 02:38:38.742
PREVENT INDIVIDUALS FROM WORKING

THE DAUGHTER AND SISTER OF

VETERANS, I UNDERSTAND JUST WHAT

02:40:04.561 --> 02:40:07.864
THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE MADE

02:40:07.931 --> 02:40:10.033
GREAT RISKS IN SERVICE TO THEIR

02:40:10.100 --> 02:40:11.835
COUNTRY HAVE GONE THROUGH JUST

02:40:11.902 --> 02:40:13.904
THIS YEAR. MY DAD PASSED AWAY IN

02:40:13.971 --> 02:40:16.373
MARCH BECAUSE OF COMPLICATIONS

02:40:16.440 --> 02:40:18.241
FROM HIS EXPOSURE TO AGENT

02:40:18.308 --> 02:40:21.445
ORANGE AND BECAUSE OF THE VA. HE

02:40:21.511 --> 02:40:23.680
LIVED 40 EXTRA YEARS FIGHTING

02:40:23.747 --> 02:40:25.482
CANCER THREE DIFFERENT TIMES IN

02:40:33.557 --> 02:40:36.293
CAN BE FOR A FAMILY AND HOW

02:40:36.360 --> 02:40:38.228
IMPORTANT IT IS TO MAKE SURE

02:40:38.295 --> 02:40:39.830
THAT VETERANS ARE CONNECTED TO

02:40:39.896 --> 02:40:43.367
THESE EFFECTIVELY. SO, YOU KNOW,

02:40:43.433 --> 02:40:46.503
I'M DEEPLY COMMITTED TO ENSURING

02:40:46.570 --> 02:40:48.271

COMMUNITY HAVE THE ABILITY TO

02:40:50.841 --> 02:40:52.376
ACCESS THE SAME CARE AND

02:40:52.442 --> 02:40:54.077
BENEFITS WITHOUT BEING EXPLOITED

02:40:54.144 --> 02:40:56.613
AND TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF AT A TIME

02:40:56.680 --> 02:40:58.248
WHEN TOO MANY FAMILIES ARE

FOOD AND HOUSING AND UTILITIES,

02:41:02.919 --> 02:41:04.955
THIS LEGISLATION WOULD SAVE

02:41:05.022 --> 02:41:06.823
VETERANS AND ESPECIALLY DISABLED

02:41:06.890 --> 02:41:09.026
VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES A

02:41:09.092 --> 02:41:10.927
LOT OF MONEY, AND IT WOULD PUT

02:41:10.994 --> 02:41:12.562
THAT MONEY BACK INTO THEIR

02:41:12.629 --> 02:41:13.563
POCKETS WHERE IT SHOULD BE,

02:41:13.630 --> 02:41:15.499
RATHER THAN LINING THE POCKETS

02:41:15.565 --> 02:41:18.402
OF FOR PROFIT COMPANIES THAT ARE

02:41:18.468 --> 02:41:19.536
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF VETERANS IN

02:41:19.603 --> 02:41:23.073
THEIR TIME OF NEED. SB 694 IS A

02:41:23.140 --> 02:41:24.908
CONSUMER PROTECTION BILL THAT

02:41:24.975 --> 02:41:27.010
ENHANCES CALIFORNIA LAW BY

02:41:27.077 --> 02:41:29.279
PROTECTING VETERANS FROM

02:41:29.346 --> 02:41:30.647

THEIR CLAIMS FOR BENEFITS TO THE

02:41:32.516 --> 02:41:36.019
VA. FOLLOWING A 2006 CHANGE IN

02:41:36.086 --> 02:41:38.188
FEDERAL LAW THAT CREATED AN

02:41:38.255 --> 02:41:40.657
UNINTENDED LOOPHOLE, FOR PROFIT

02:41:40.724 --> 02:41:43.260
COMPANIES HAVE PROLIFERATED

02:41:43.326 --> 02:41:45.262
NATIONWIDE AFTER THAT CHANGE,

02:41:45.328 --> 02:41:47.264
AND THEY ARE RAKING IN MILLIONS

02:41:47.330 --> 02:41:48.632
AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN

02:41:48.698 --> 02:41:50.767

02:41:50.834 --> 02:41:52.803
EXORBITANT FEES TO HELP THEM

02:41:52.869 --> 02:41:54.704

02:42:00.544 --> 02:42:02.813
PRECISELY FOR THIS INDUSTRY.

02:42:02.879 --> 02:42:04.781
FEES THAT CAN BE ALMOST A HALF

02:42:04.848 --> 02:42:06.550
OF A YEAR OF DISABILITY

02:42:06.616 --> 02:42:08.452
BENEFITS. SO IF YOU THINK OF

02:42:08.518 --> 02:42:10.987
DISABLED VETERANS GIVING UP A

02:42:11.054 --> 02:42:13.957
HALF OF YEAR OF THEIR BENEFITS,

02:42:14.024 --> 02:42:15.559
HOW MANY PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO DO

02:42:15.625 --> 02:42:17.427
THAT? WHAT'S WORSE IS THAT

02:42:17.494 --> 02:42:19.830
THEY'RE DOING SO DESPITE THE

02:42:19.896 --> 02:42:22.332
FACT THAT ASSISTANCE IS PROVIDED

02:42:22.399 --> 02:42:24.868

FEDERAL LAW. SO FEDERAL LAW

02:43:15.418 --> 02:43:17.154
CURRENTLY STATES THAT THEY ARE

WITH THE INITIAL FILING FOR VA

02:43:23.393 --> 02:43:25.462
DISABILITY CLAIM. IT ALLOWS

02:43:25.529 --> 02:43:27.330
CHARGING A VETERAN ONLY AFTER

02:43:27.397 --> 02:43:29.533
THE VA ISSUED A NOTICE THAT THE

02:43:29.599 --> 02:43:32.736
INITIAL CLAIM DECISION WAS

02:43:32.802 --> 02:43:35.205
DENIED, AND ONLY IF THE VA

02:43:35.272 --> 02:43:39.109
ACCREDITS THEM. IT SETS

02:43:39.176 --> 02:43:40.944
REASONABLE FEES AND CAN BE

02:43:41.011 --> 02:43:43.046
CHARGED AFTER AN INITIAL CLAIM

02:43:43.113 --> 02:43:46.216

02:43:46.283 --> 02:43:48.518
MENTIONED IN 2006, THE CRIMINAL

DISABILITY CLAIMS WERE

02:43:56.393 --> 02:43:57.460
ELIMINATED. ALTHOUGH THOSE

02:43:57.527 --> 02:43:59.296
PENALTIES WERE ELIMINATED, IT

02:43:59.362 --> 02:44:01.131
REMAINS ILLEGAL UNDER FEDERAL

02:44:01.198 --> 02:44:03.233
LAW FOR ANYONE WHO IS

02:44:03.300 --> 02:44:05.702

02:44:14.911 --> 02:44:17.314
COMPANIES THAT OPERATE DO THIS

02:44:17.380 --> 02:44:20.116
DO PRECISELY THIS. THE VA HAS

02:44:20.183 --> 02:44:22.385
ISSUED NUMEROUS CEASE AND DESIST

02:44:22.452 --> 02:44:23.887
LETTERS, BUT IT LACKS THE

02:44:23.954 --> 02:44:26.256
AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE PENALTIES.

02:44:26.323 --> 02:44:27.657
NONE OF THESE COMPANIES EXISTED

02:44:27.724 --> 02:44:29.492
UNTIL AFTER THE CRIMINAL

02:44:29.559 --> 02:44:31.595
PENALTIES WERE ELIMINATED IN

02:44:31.661 --> 02:44:33.530
2006, AND NUMEROUS STATE

02:44:33.597 --> 02:44:35.665
ATTORNEY GENERALS HAVE ACTIVELY

02:44:35.732 --> 02:44:37.100
INVESTIGATED THESE COMPANIES,

02:44:37.167 --> 02:44:39.135
BUT OFTEN LACKED STATE LAW THAT

02:44:39.202 --> 02:44:40.704
PERMITS THEM TO DO ANYTHING

02:44:40.770 --> 02:44:42.472
ABOUT THEIR OPERATION. THIS BILL

02:44:42.539 --> 02:44:44.241
WILL HELP OUR STATE PROTECT

02:44:44.307 --> 02:44:47.611
VETERANS WHO EXPLOIT FROM

02:44:47.677 --> 02:44:48.979
EXPLOITATION BY STRENGTHENING

02:44:49.045 --> 02:44:50.780
EXISTING STATE LAW AND

02:44:50.847 --> 02:44:52.749
PROHIBITING EXORBITANT FEES FROM

02:44:52.816 --> 02:44:54.284
BEING CHARGED. THE LARGEST

02:44:54.351 --> 02:44:56.152
NATIONAL AND STATE VETERANS

02:44:56.219 --> 02:44:57.254
ORGANIZATIONS WITH MILLIONS OF

02:44:57.320 --> 02:44:58.655

02:44:58.722 --> 02:45:00.924
THIS CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA TO

02:45:00.991 --> 02:45:02.692
PROTECT OUR VETERANS. AND AFTER

02:45:02.759 --> 02:45:04.394
THESE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN RISKED

02:45:04.461 --> 02:45:06.696
THEIR LIVES TO PROTECT OURS, AT

02:45:06.763 --> 02:45:08.498
THE LEAST WE CAN DO IS ENSURE

02:45:08.565 --> 02:45:09.866
THAT THEY ARE NOT TAKEN

02:45:09.933 --> 02:45:11.935
ADVANTAGE OF WHEN THEY NEED

02:45:12.002 --> 02:45:13.603
SUPPORT TO ACCESS THEIR BENEFITS

02:45:13.670 --> 02:45:17.107

MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY

02:45:23.747 --> 02:45:26.349

COUNTY VETERANS SERVICE OFFICER

02:45:30.820 --> 02:45:31.855
THERE. I'M ALSO THE CHAIR OF THE

02:45:31.921 --> 02:45:33.089
LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE FOR THE

02:45:33.156 --> 02:45:34.391
CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY

02:45:34.457 --> 02:45:35.725
VETERANS SERVICE OFFICERS. I'M

02:45:35.792 --> 02:45:37.527
HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE

02:45:37.594 --> 02:45:38.361
ASSOCIATION, TO EXPRESS OUR

02:45:38.428 --> 02:45:41.965
STRONG SUPPORT FOR SB 694 AND TO

02:45:42.032 --> 02:45:43.667
RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT.

02:45:43.733 --> 02:45:44.868
YOU'LL HEAR FROM SOME BUSINESSES

02:45:44.934 --> 02:45:46.469
AND OPPONENTS THAT SAY IT'S

02:45:46.536 --> 02:45:48.038
ABOUT CHOICE. WE REJECT THIS

02:45:48.104 --> 02:45:49.506
FALSE EQUIVALENCY THAT SAYS

02:45:49.572 --> 02:45:51.541
SINCE PHOEBE BASED UNREGULATED

02:45:51.608 --> 02:45:53.410
SERVICES ARE THE ONLY OPTION IN

02:45:53.476 --> 02:45:54.811
SOME COMMUNITIES THAN IT IS GOOD

02:45:54.878 --> 02:45:57.180
ENOUGH. BETTER THAN NOTHING IS

02:45:57.247 --> 02:45:59.549
NOT A POLICY, AND IT'S NOT HOW

02:45:59.616 --> 02:46:00.650
WE SHOULD BUILD. THAT'S NOT HOW

02:46:00.717 --> 02:46:02.352
WE BUILD EQUITY. CHOICE IS NOT

02:46:02.419 --> 02:46:03.853
THE SAME AS NECESSITY, AND

02:46:03.920 --> 02:46:05.955
CHOICE SHOULD BE ALLOWED UNDER A

02:46:06.022 --> 02:46:08.224
LEGALLY PROTECTED NETWORK. SOME

02:46:08.291 --> 02:46:09.626
OPPONENTS HAVE CITED THAT IN

02:46:09.693 --> 02:46:11.061
2006, CHANGES THAT REPEALED THE

02:46:11.127 --> 02:46:12.929
PENALTIES FOR CERTAIN CLAIM ACTS

02:46:12.996 --> 02:46:13.930
WERE FUNDAMENTAL. THEY WERE. THE

02:46:13.997 --> 02:46:15.598
FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES WERE TO

02:46:15.665 --> 02:46:19.336
REMOVE ALL ACCOUNTABILITY. IN

02:46:19.402 --> 02:46:20.437
FEBRUARY 2023, THE CONSUMER

02:46:20.503 --> 02:46:21.671
FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU AND

02:46:21.738 --> 02:46:22.906
THE US DEPARTMENT OF VETERAN

02:46:22.972 --> 02:46:24.674

02:46:24.741 --> 02:46:25.875
ABOUT UNACCREDITED ACTORS

02:46:25.942 --> 02:46:27.544
CHARGING ILLEGAL FEES FOR FILING

02:46:27.610 --> 02:46:29.312
CLAIMS, OFTEN USING TITLES LIKE

02:46:29.379 --> 02:46:32.282
COACH OR CONSULTANT. THE WARNING

02:46:32.349 --> 02:46:33.516
NOTED THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE

02:46:33.583 --> 02:46:34.417
DEMANDED A PERCENTAGE OF THE

02:46:34.484 --> 02:46:36.052
VETERANS BENEFITS AND IN SOME

02:46:36.119 --> 02:46:37.921
CASES SENT UNPAID BILLS TO THIRD

02:46:37.987 --> 02:46:41.024
PARTY DEBT COLLECTORS. THESE ARE

02:46:41.091 --> 02:46:42.325
REAL PATTERNS AND THEY ARE

02:46:42.392 --> 02:46:43.560
HAPPENING RIGHT HERE IN

02:46:43.626 --> 02:46:44.094
CALIFORNIA. AND YET WHEN

02:46:44.160 --> 02:46:45.362
VETERANS ARE HARMED, THERE ISN'T

02:46:45.428 --> 02:46:48.064
A PATH TO REPORT IT OR SEEK

02:46:48.131 --> 02:46:49.399
RELIEF. SOME HAVE ASKED FOR

02:46:49.466 --> 02:46:52.202
DATA, AND WE AGREE WE'D LIKE TO

02:46:52.268 --> 02:46:52.802
SEE THAT DATA. IF THE STATE

02:46:52.869 --> 02:46:54.237
WANTS A REAL UNDERSTANDING OF

02:46:54.304 --> 02:46:55.672
THE IMPACT OF THESE SERVICES,

02:46:55.739 --> 02:46:56.940
THEN CREATE THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK

02:46:57.006 --> 02:46:58.908
THAT ALLOWS FOR TRANSPARENCY AND

02:46:58.975 --> 02:46:59.709
ACCOUNTABILITY. WE'VE ALSO HEARD

02:46:59.776 --> 02:47:01.745
THE CONCERN THAT REMOVING THESE

02:47:01.811 --> 02:47:03.246
ACTORS WILL REDUCE ACCESS.

02:47:03.313 --> 02:47:04.848
ANOTHER PART OF THE ISSUE IS

02:47:04.914 --> 02:47:06.249
INSUFFICIENT FUNDING IN THE

02:47:06.316 --> 02:47:07.951
INFRASTRUCTURE. CALIFORNIA HAS A

VSOS THAT SERVES VETERANS,

02:47:12.288 --> 02:47:14.057
RELYING ON COUNTIES AND VETERAN

SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS TO PICK UP

02:47:14.824 --> 02:47:16.926
THE SLACK. IF WE WANT TO EXPAND

02:47:16.993 --> 02:47:17.994
ACCESS, THEN FUND THE SYSTEMS

02:47:18.061 --> 02:47:19.829
THAT ARE BUILT TO HELP. WE DON'T

02:47:19.896 --> 02:47:21.264
LOOK FOR A SINGLE PAYOUT. WE

02:47:21.331 --> 02:47:22.999
BUILD SAFETY NETS AROUND

02:47:23.066 --> 02:47:24.734
VETERANS THAT COME TO US NOT

02:47:24.801 --> 02:47:25.935
JUST FOR A CLAIM, BUT HELP WITH

02:47:26.002 --> 02:47:28.605
HOUSING. ON BEHALF OF CÁC, VSO,

02:47:28.671 --> 02:47:30.573
AND THE VETERANS WE SERVE ACROSS

02:47:30.640 --> 02:47:32.776

02:55:41.998 --> 02:55:42.698
FOR VETERANS, AND WE ARE DOING

02:55:42.765 --> 02:55:45.401
SO IN AN ETHICAL, UPFRONT AND

02:55:45.468 --> 02:55:47.303
TRANSPARENT MANNER. I WOULD ALSO

02:55:47.370 --> 02:55:49.438
LIKE TO ADDRESS A FEW OF THE

02:55:49.505 --> 02:55:51.207
ISSUES THAT WERE BROUGHT UP

02:55:51.274 --> 02:55:52.174
TODAY. NUMBER ONE, WE BELIEVE

02:55:52.241 --> 02:55:53.943
THAT WE ARE OPERATING COMPLETELY

02:55:54.010 --> 02:55:55.945
IN COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL LAW.

02:55:56.012 --> 02:55:58.014
THE INDICATION FROM THE COURTS,

02:55:58.080 --> 02:55:59.148
PARTICULARLY THE THIRD CIRCUIT,

02:55:59.215 --> 02:56:00.449
IN A CASE THAT WE ARE DEALING

02:56:00.516 --> 02:56:03.085
WITH, ALSO IS INDICATING

02:56:03.152 --> 02:56:04.654
AFFIRMATION OF OUR

02:56:04.720 --> 02:56:05.655
INTERPRETATION OF FEDERAL LAW.

02:56:05.721 --> 02:56:07.790
SO THAT IS NOT A SETTLED ISSUE.

02:56:07.857 --> 02:56:09.458
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADDRESS

02:56:09.525 --> 02:56:12.061
THAT. WE ARE WORKING HEAVILY TO

02:56:12.128 --> 02:56:13.896
TRY AND REFORM THE ACCREDITATION

02:56:13.963 --> 02:56:15.331
PROCESS. I'VE BEEN WORKING AT

02:56:15.398 --> 02:56:16.866
THE FEDERAL LEVEL. THERE IS A

02:56:16.933 --> 02:56:18.200
BILL CALLED THE CHOICE ACT,

02:56:18.267 --> 02:56:19.735
WHICH IS PASSED OUT OF THE HOUSE

02:56:19.802 --> 02:56:20.736
VETERAN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE AND

02:56:20.803 --> 02:56:22.605
WILL BE GOING FOR THE BEFORE THE

02:56:22.672 --> 02:56:24.073
FULL HOUSE IN NOVEMBER. THAT

02:56:24.140 --> 02:56:25.808
WILL OPEN UP ACCREDITATION FOR

02:56:25.875 --> 02:56:28.377
COMPANIES LIKE OURS, ALLOW US TO

02:56:28.444 --> 02:56:30.579
CHARGE A FEE AT ANY STEP OF THE

02:56:30.646 --> 02:56:31.547
PROCESS, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,

02:56:31.614 --> 02:56:33.316
PUTTING CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. WE

02:56:33.382 --> 02:56:34.583
UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS ABOUT

02:56:34.650 --> 02:56:36.519
THE PREDATORY PRACTICES. I SHARE

02:56:36.585 --> 02:56:37.987
THEM. WE NEED TO PROTECT

02:56:38.054 --> 02:56:39.555
VETERANS. WE FEEL A BETTER WAY

02:56:39.622 --> 02:56:40.856
TO DO THAT IS, RATHER THAN

02:56:40.923 --> 02:56:42.325
GETTING RID OF THE WHOLE

02:56:42.391 --> 02:56:43.359
INDUSTRY, LET'S LEGISLATE

02:56:43.426 --> 02:56:44.894
AGAINST THE PRACTICES WE DON'T

02:56:44.961 --> 02:56:46.529
LIKE. LET'S LEGISLATE AGAINST

02:56:46.595 --> 02:56:48.431
THE PREDATORY PRACTICES AND

02:56:48.497 --> 02:56:49.932
PROVIDE PROTECTIONS FOR VETERANS

02:56:49.999 --> 02:56:51.334
WHILE STILL MAINTAINING THEIR

02:56:51.400 --> 02:56:53.235
FREEDOM OF CHOICE TO PURSUE A

02:56:53.302 --> 02:56:55.171
CLAIM IN THE MANNER THAT BEST

02:56:55.237 --> 02:56:56.906
FITS THEIR NEEDS. THANK YOU,

02:56:56.973 --> 02:57:04.013
THANK YOU. THIS IS MY FIRST TIME

02:57:04.080 --> 02:57:09.051
DOING THIS, SO WELCOME, DEAR

02:57:09.118 --> 02:57:09.618
CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE

02:57:09.685 --> 02:57:11.253
COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS RYAN

02:57:11.320 --> 02:57:13.389

02:57:13.456 --> 02:57:14.290

02:57:18.060 --> 02:57:19.862

02:57:19.929 --> 02:57:21.964
OPPOSITION TO SB 694 AS

02:57:22.031 --> 02:57:23.733
CURRENTLY WRITTEN. AFTER I LEFT

02:57:23.799 --> 02:57:25.634
ACTIVE DUTY, I JOINED THE VA TO

02:57:25.701 --> 02:57:27.603
CONTINUE MY SERVICE TO FELLOW

02:57:27.670 --> 02:57:30.106
VETERANS AND SPENT 11 YEARS, 11

02:57:30.172 --> 02:57:32.475
YEARS ADJUDICATING DISABILITY

COMPENSATION CLAIMS AND

02:57:33.843 --> 02:57:35.578
PERFORMED QUALITY REVIEWS ON MY

02:57:35.644 --> 02:57:37.613
COLLEAGUES BEFORE LEAVING TO

02:57:37.680 --> 02:57:38.848
JOIN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AS

02:57:38.914 --> 02:57:41.350

COMPLIANCE FOR VETERAN BENEFITS

02:57:43.285 --> 02:57:45.187
GUIDE. I STRONGLY SUPPORT

02:57:45.254 --> 02:57:46.789
ASSEMBLYMAN ARCHULETA'S

02:57:46.856 --> 02:57:48.891
COMMITMENT TO PROTECTING OUR

02:57:48.958 --> 02:57:50.726
VETERANS, BUT UNFORTUNATELY,

02:57:50.793 --> 02:57:52.762
THIS BILL PROPOSES TO EXASPERATE

02:57:52.828 --> 02:57:54.597
THE VERY SHORTFALLS THAT I

02:57:54.663 --> 02:57:56.432
WITNESSED IN MY CAPACITY WORKING

02:57:56.499 --> 02:57:59.635
AT THE VA. I HAVE ADJUDICATED

02:57:59.702 --> 02:58:01.670
THOUSANDS OF CLAIMS, REVIEWED

02:58:01.737 --> 02:58:03.973
AND PROCESSED TENS OF THOUSANDS

02:58:04.040 --> 02:58:06.609
MORE FROM VETERANS ATTEMPTING TO

02:58:06.675 --> 02:58:09.011
NAVIGATE THE PROCESS, EITHER ON

02:58:09.078 --> 02:58:10.579
THEIR OWN AND OH MY GOD, THE

02:58:10.646 --> 02:58:14.717
LIGHTS ARE OUT. SIGN FROM GOD.

02:58:14.784 --> 02:58:18.487
YEAH, YOU HAVE. YEAH, YEAH. I

02:58:18.554 --> 02:58:20.256
HAVEN'T HAD THAT HAPPEN. OKAY.

02:58:20.322 --> 02:58:21.624
ALL RIGHT, SPECIAL OPS. EVERYONE

02:58:21.690 --> 02:58:24.160
TAKE A DEEP BREATH. FORCES THAT

02:58:24.226 --> 02:58:24.794
DID THAT. YEAH. ALL RIGHT. YOU

02:58:24.860 --> 02:58:27.329
MAY CONTINUE. SO I HAVE

02:58:27.396 --> 02:58:29.231
ADJUDICATED THOUSANDS OF CLAIMS

02:58:29.298 --> 02:58:31.400
REVIEWED AND PROCESSED TENS OF

02:58:31.467 --> 02:58:32.835
THOUSANDS MORE FROM VETERANS

02:58:32.902 --> 02:58:34.303
ATTEMPTING TO NAVIGATE THE

02:58:34.370 --> 02:58:36.806
PROCESS, EITHER ON THEIR OWN

02:58:36.872 --> 02:58:39.909
THROUGH ACCREDITED AGENTS. VSOS,

02:58:39.975 --> 02:58:42.445
INCLUDING IN THIS ROOM TODAY.

02:58:42.511 --> 02:58:45.714
AND LASTLY, COSTLY ATTORNEYS. I

02:58:45.781 --> 02:58:47.283
REALIZED THAT THE BEST WAY I

02:58:47.349 --> 02:58:49.452
COULD EFFECT POSITIVE CHANGE FOR

02:58:49.518 --> 02:58:50.486
VETERANS WAS TO TAKE MY

02:58:50.553 --> 02:58:52.588
KNOWLEDGE OF THE VA AND THE

02:58:52.655 --> 02:58:53.789
LEGACY PROCESS OF ADJUDICATING

02:58:53.856 --> 02:58:55.758
CLAIMS TO PROVIDE A BETTER

02:58:55.825 --> 02:58:56.959
SOLUTION FOR VETERANS. VETERANS

02:58:57.026 --> 02:58:59.161
LACK EXPERIENCE AND

02:58:59.228 --> 02:59:00.596
INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE, WHICH

02:59:00.663 --> 02:59:02.731
IS WHAT I HAVE, AND DECIDED THAT

02:59:02.798 --> 02:59:04.400
THIS WAS THE BEST WAY I COULD BE

02:59:04.467 --> 02:59:06.335
OF SERVICE TO MAKE THE BIGGEST

02:59:06.402 --> 02:59:08.170
IMPACT. AS A DISABLED VETERAN

02:59:08.237 --> 02:59:10.272
MYSELF, IT TOOK EIGHT YEARS TO

02:59:10.339 --> 02:59:12.341
GET MY APPROPRIATE RATING AND

02:59:12.408 --> 02:59:14.343
THAT WAS SECURED THROUGH THE

02:59:14.410 --> 02:59:15.644
SERVICES OF VBG. IF IT WEREN'T

02:59:15.711 --> 02:59:17.546
FOR THIS CRITICAL INDUSTRY'S

02:59:17.613 --> 02:59:19.415
ABILITY TO COMPILE A FULLY

02:59:19.482 --> 02:59:20.983
DEVELOPED CLAIM, I BELIEVE I

02:59:21.050 --> 02:59:22.885
WOULD STILL BE FIGHTING THE VA

02:59:22.952 --> 02:59:24.386
WITH ALL THE RESOURCES THAT I

02:59:24.453 --> 02:59:26.889
HAD, THE VERY BURDENSOME AND

02:59:26.956 --> 02:59:27.857
BUREAUCRATIC PROCESS WITH

02:59:27.923 --> 02:59:29.825
FORMING A FULLY DEVELOPED CLAIM

02:59:29.892 --> 02:59:31.193
IS WHAT GAVE BIRTH TO THE

02:59:31.260 --> 02:59:33.429
PRIVATE INDUSTRY, WHICH IN MOST

02:59:33.496 --> 02:59:35.264
CASES SUCCESSFULLY PROVIDES A

02:59:35.331 --> 02:59:37.166
MUCH NEEDED SERVICE, A MUCH

02:59:37.233 --> 02:59:38.601
NEEDED OPTION FOR VETERANS.

02:59:38.667 --> 02:59:41.203
TODAY, I WOULD BE MORE THAN

02:59:41.270 --> 02:59:42.705
HAPPY TO LEND MY EXPERIENCE FROM

02:59:42.771 --> 02:59:44.607
THE VA AND IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR

02:59:44.673 --> 02:59:46.108
TO IMPROVE PROTECTIONS FOR

02:59:46.175 --> 02:59:47.076
VETERANS WHILE ALSO ALLOWING A

02:59:47.143 --> 02:59:49.245
PATH FOR HONORABLE, FOR PROFIT

02:59:49.311 --> 02:59:50.946
COMPANIES. UNFORTUNATELY, THE

02:59:51.013 --> 02:59:52.381
BILL IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN.

02:59:52.448 --> 02:59:54.250
PROPOSES TO INCREASE COST TO

02:59:54.316 --> 02:59:55.317
VETERANS WHILE REDUCING FREEDOM

02:59:55.384 --> 02:59:57.920
OF CHOICE AND ACCESS TO VETERAN

02:59:57.987 --> 02:59:59.989
SERVICES. SO FOR THAT, I ASK FOR

03:00:00.055 --> 03:00:03.259
YOU. NO VOTE ON SB 694 AS

03:00:03.325 --> 03:00:04.727
CURRENTLY WRITTEN. THANK YOU,

AS WELL AS, OF COURSE, OUR

IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS,

03:01:40.022 --> 03:01:42.324
COMMENTS OR ANY MOTIONS. SENATOR

03:01:42.391 --> 03:01:46.428
MACEDO. I THINK THIS BILL HAS

03:01:46.495 --> 03:01:48.364
TAKEN THE MOST TIME AS FAR AS

03:01:48.430 --> 03:01:49.865
REALLY TRYING TO WORK THROUGH

03:01:49.932 --> 03:01:51.467
IT, BECAUSE THIS WAS AN ISSUE

03:01:51.533 --> 03:01:54.036
BROUGHT TO ME BY VETERANS FROM

03:01:54.103 --> 03:01:55.871
MY DISTRICT OF THE PREDATORY

03:01:55.938 --> 03:01:57.139
PRACTICES THAT ARE HAPPENING. SO

03:01:57.206 --> 03:01:58.507
FIRST AND FOREMOST, I WANT TO

03:01:58.574 --> 03:01:59.775
ECHO THE SENTIMENTS OF OUR

03:01:59.842 --> 03:02:01.377
CHAIR. IT'S SO INCREDIBLE TO

03:02:01.443 --> 03:02:02.444
HAVE PEOPLE THAT HAVE SERVED,

03:02:02.511 --> 03:02:03.512
THAT ARE FAMILY MEMBERS OF THOSE

03:02:03.579 --> 03:02:05.281
THAT HAVE SERVED, BECAUSE TRULY,

03:02:05.347 --> 03:02:07.750
WE OWE YOU WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY.

03:02:07.816 --> 03:02:09.551
MY CONSTITUENTS ARE DEMANDING

03:02:09.618 --> 03:02:11.020
CHANGE IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA,

03:02:11.086 --> 03:02:12.655
AND I THINK THAT I'VE MADE THAT

03:02:12.721 --> 03:02:15.758
CLEAR BOTH TO EVERYBODY HERE

03:02:15.824 --> 03:02:16.892
TODAY. AND VETERANS ARE HURTING,

03:02:16.959 --> 03:02:18.794
AND THEY NEED HELP NAVIGATING

03:02:18.861 --> 03:02:20.796
THE VERY BUREAUCRATIC SYSTEM.

03:02:20.863 --> 03:02:22.298
AND IF THERE'S A COMPLETE BAN ON

03:02:22.364 --> 03:02:23.565
THE THIRD PARTIES TO ASSIST

03:02:23.632 --> 03:02:25.000
VETERANS. MY QUESTION FOR YOU,

03:02:25.067 --> 03:02:27.202
SENATOR, IS CAN THE VSO HANDLE

03:02:27.269 --> 03:02:29.104
THAT CASELOAD, FIRST OF ALL? AND

03:02:29.171 --> 03:02:30.506
THEN SECONDLY, WHAT WOULD BE

03:02:30.572 --> 03:02:31.807
THEIR PLAN TO ABSORB THE

03:02:31.874 --> 03:02:34.176
INCREASE IN THOSE CASELOADS?

03:02:34.243 --> 03:02:36.078
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION.

03:02:36.145 --> 03:02:38.013
REMEMBER ASSEMBLY MEMBERS,

03:02:38.080 --> 03:02:39.248
COMMITTEE MEMBERS, EVERYONE IN

03:02:39.315 --> 03:02:41.884
THE AUDIENCE, THE VETERANS

03:02:41.950 --> 03:02:43.018
ADMINISTRATION IS DOING

03:02:43.085 --> 03:02:44.353
EVERYTHING THEY CAN EVERY SINGLE

03:02:44.420 --> 03:02:46.655
DAY TO HELP OUR VETERANS, NO

03:02:46.722 --> 03:02:48.190
DOUBT. SO THEY HAD TO REACH OUT

03:02:48.257 --> 03:02:49.224
TO THESE EXPERTS. AND I

03:02:49.291 --> 03:02:50.726
MENTIONED THE AMERICAN LEGION,

03:02:50.793 --> 03:02:52.061
AMVETS, AND ALL THESE VARIOUS

03:02:52.127 --> 03:02:53.796
ORGANIZATIONS THAT YOU SAW, AND

03:02:53.862 --> 03:02:56.031
THEY HAVE BEEN TRAINED AND

03:02:56.098 --> 03:02:58.100
CERTIFIED. AND THE ISSUE HERE IS

03:02:58.167 --> 03:03:00.636
ABOUT ACCREDITATION. THAT'S THE

03:03:00.703 --> 03:03:02.538
KEY. AND I WELCOME THESE

03:03:02.604 --> 03:03:05.074
GENTLEMEN TO PARTICIPATE, GET

03:03:05.140 --> 03:03:05.874
ACCREDITED. COULD YOU PRACTICE

03:03:05.941 --> 03:03:07.543
LAW WITHOUT A LICENSE? I DON'T

03:03:07.609 --> 03:03:09.378
THINK SO. CAN YOU DRIVE A BIG

03:03:09.445 --> 03:03:10.713
RIG WITHOUT A COMMERCIAL

03:03:10.779 --> 03:03:12.214
LICENSE? I DON'T THINK SO. CAN

03:03:12.281 --> 03:03:13.882
YOU SELL REAL ESTATE WITHOUT A

03:03:13.949 --> 03:03:15.384
BROKER'S LICENSE? I DON'T THINK

03:03:15.451 --> 03:03:18.354
SO. DO YOU HAVE THE TALENT TO DO

03:03:18.420 --> 03:03:19.555
IT? YOU PROBABLY COULD. IN YOUR

03:03:19.621 --> 03:03:22.124
BACKYARD, YOUR GARAGE. BUT THESE

03:03:22.191 --> 03:03:23.559
ARE PROFESSIONAL INDIVIDUALS

03:03:23.625 --> 03:03:25.194
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT

03:03:25.260 --> 03:03:28.030
ARE ACCREDITED. AND I WELCOME

03:03:28.097 --> 03:03:30.265
THEIR JOURNEY TO ACCREDITATION.

03:03:30.332 --> 03:03:32.000
AS A MATTER OF FACT, WHEN WE

03:03:32.067 --> 03:03:34.103
PRESENTED THE BILL EARLIER, I

03:03:34.169 --> 03:03:38.474
INVITED OUR MEMBERS HERE TO SIT

03:03:38.540 --> 03:03:41.076
WITH ME. GIVE ME YOUR LIST OF

03:03:41.143 --> 03:03:42.811
THINGS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE IN A

03:03:42.878 --> 03:03:44.780
BILL TO GET THE BAD APPLES OUT,

03:03:44.847 --> 03:03:46.915
AM I CORRECT? I DID THAT CORRECT

03:03:46.982 --> 03:03:48.550
AND I AM STILL WILLING TO DO

03:03:48.617 --> 03:03:50.719
THAT. IN THE INTERIM. WE HAVE TO

03:03:50.786 --> 03:03:52.554
MAINTAIN FEDERAL LAW. WE HAVE TO

03:03:52.621 --> 03:03:54.757
MAINTAIN STATE LAW AND STATE LAW

03:03:54.823 --> 03:03:56.558
ACCORDING TO THE ATTORNEY

03:03:56.625 --> 03:03:57.893
GENERAL. AND EVERYONE ELSE IS

03:03:57.960 --> 03:03:59.795
THAT WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE

03:03:59.862 --> 03:04:01.630
THESE INDIVIDUALS PRACTICE

03:04:01.697 --> 03:04:03.265
WITHOUT BEING ACCREDITATION

03:04:03.332 --> 03:04:05.501
PROCESS. AND THAT'S THE GIST OF

03:04:05.567 --> 03:04:06.869
IT ALL. I THANK THEM FOR THEIR

03:04:06.935 --> 03:04:09.838
SERVICE. THE WEST POINTER, AS I

03:04:09.905 --> 03:04:11.673
MENTIONED, I SERVED ON THE BOARD

03:04:11.740 --> 03:04:13.108
OVERSEEING THE WEST POINT

03:04:13.175 --> 03:04:15.277
GRADUATES AND SO ON. I DID THAT

03:04:15.344 --> 03:04:17.045
WITH THE PRESIDENT. SO I KNOW

03:04:17.112 --> 03:04:19.214
YOUR DEVOTION TO DUTY, GOD AND

03:04:19.281 --> 03:04:20.315
SERVICE. I GOT THAT, BUT YOU'RE

03:04:20.382 --> 03:04:22.418
NOT ACCREDITED. THIS GENTLEMAN

03:04:22.484 --> 03:04:24.953
HERE WHO'S A GREAT CASE SOUNDS

03:04:25.020 --> 03:04:26.355
LIKE HE'S AN EXPERT. WHAT A

03:04:26.422 --> 03:04:28.457
PERFECT GUY TO BE ACCREDITED.

03:04:28.524 --> 03:04:30.359
AND THAT IS MY POINT. LET'S GET

03:04:30.426 --> 03:04:32.060
THEM ACCREDITED. LET'S GET

03:04:32.127 --> 03:04:33.529
BEHIND THEM. BUT LET'S FOLLOW

03:04:33.595 --> 03:04:35.764
THE LAW. SENATOR, ONE OF YOUR

03:04:35.831 --> 03:04:37.800
LEAD WITNESSES HAS A COMMENT

03:04:37.866 --> 03:04:38.934
REGARDING ABSORBING SOME OF THE

03:04:39.001 --> 03:04:40.869
WORKLOAD. YES, MA'AM. SO I'M

03:04:40.936 --> 03:04:42.204
DAVID WEST, PRESIDENT OF THE

03:04:42.271 --> 03:04:43.372
CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY

03:04:43.439 --> 03:04:44.773
VETERANS SERVICES OFFICERS. AND

03:04:44.840 --> 03:04:46.575
I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT

03:04:46.642 --> 03:04:47.876
LAST YEAR, OUR ASSOCIATION

03:04:47.943 --> 03:04:49.745
SUBMITTED 12% OF THE TOTAL

03:04:49.812 --> 03:04:51.113
CLAIMS THAT WAS RECEIVED BY THE

03:04:51.180 --> 03:04:53.549
VA, AND WE ONLY HAVE 8% OF THE

03:04:53.615 --> 03:04:55.484
VETERAN POPULATION IN OUR UNION.

03:04:55.551 --> 03:04:57.986
OUR DATA IS EASILY VERIFIABLE,

03:04:58.053 --> 03:04:59.721
RIGHT? ALL OF OUR CLAIMS ARE

03:04:59.788 --> 03:05:00.923
SUBMITTED THROUGH CHALVET AND GO

03:05:00.989 --> 03:05:03.091
TO THE GO THROUGH THE VA. THESE

03:05:03.158 --> 03:05:04.092
GENTLEMEN ARE SPEAKING ABOUT

03:05:04.159 --> 03:05:05.561
DATA THAT HAS NOT BEEN VERIFIED

03:05:05.627 --> 03:05:07.396
BY ANYBODY OUTSIDE OF THEIR OWN

03:05:07.463 --> 03:05:09.231
COMPANY. THEY CAN MAKE ANY

03:05:09.298 --> 03:05:09.832
CLAIMS THAT THEY WANT WITHOUT

03:05:09.898 --> 03:05:10.732
HAVING ANY DATA THAT'S BEEN

03:05:10.799 --> 03:05:12.401
VERIFIED BY BY A THIRD PARTY IS

03:05:12.468 --> 03:05:13.735
WHAT CALIFORNIA LIKES TO CALL

03:05:13.802 --> 03:05:15.471
JUNK DATA, RIGHT? WE CAN'T TAKE

03:05:15.537 --> 03:05:17.239
THEIR WORD. WE CAN'T TAKE THEIR

03:05:17.306 --> 03:05:18.674
CLAIMS. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT

03:05:18.740 --> 03:05:19.775
CLAIMS ARE. THEY'RE CHOOSING NOT

03:05:19.842 --> 03:05:21.210
TO WORK BECAUSE THERE'S NOT

03:05:21.276 --> 03:05:22.978
ENOUGH PROFIT MARGIN FOR THEM.

03:05:23.045 --> 03:05:24.546
BUT NO, MA'AM. AND ONE MORE

03:05:24.613 --> 03:05:26.715
THING I WANT TO POINT OUT TO YOU

03:05:26.782 --> 03:05:27.549
THAT WE WERE WORKING WITH

03:05:27.616 --> 03:05:29.985
CHALVET TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO

03:05:30.052 --> 03:05:30.919
A DO A CENTRALIZED WORK QUEUE

03:05:30.986 --> 03:05:32.988
FOR SOME OF OUR COUNTIES THAT

03:05:33.055 --> 03:05:34.389
MIGHT NEED ASSISTANCE IN THAT

03:05:34.456 --> 03:05:34.957
AREA. THANK YOU. ACTUALLY,

03:05:35.023 --> 03:05:36.358
BEFORE YOU STEP AWAY, I DO HAVE

03:05:36.425 --> 03:05:37.793
A FOLLOW UP QUESTION. SO WHAT

03:05:37.860 --> 03:05:39.895
WILL HAPPEN OR WHO WILL HELP THE

03:05:39.962 --> 03:05:40.829
VETERANS WHOSE APPLICATIONS HAVE

03:05:40.896 --> 03:05:43.198
BEEN WRONGLY DENIED? WE HELP

03:05:43.265 --> 03:05:44.733
THEM RIGHT NOW. WE CONTINUE TO

03:05:44.800 --> 03:05:46.335
HELP THEM. WE HAVE VETS. THE

03:05:46.401 --> 03:05:47.836
REASON WHY WE FIND OUT ABOUT

03:05:47.903 --> 03:05:48.504
THESE COMPANIES IS BECAUSE THEY

03:05:48.570 --> 03:05:50.205
DON'T HAVE THE ACCESS TO THE

03:05:50.272 --> 03:05:51.740
VETERANS CLAIM FOLDER THAT WE

03:05:51.807 --> 03:05:52.941
HAVE. SO THESE THESE COMPANIES

03:05:53.008 --> 03:05:55.744
ARE SUBMITTING CLAIMS OR

03:05:55.811 --> 03:05:56.812
PREPARING CLAIMS OR WHATEVER

03:05:56.879 --> 03:05:58.247
TERM THAT THEY'RE USING. THEY

03:05:58.313 --> 03:06:00.082
SUBMIT THEM AND IT GOES INTO THE

03:06:00.148 --> 03:06:01.517
VA AND THEY ONLY HAVE A TOOL

03:06:01.583 --> 03:06:02.951
CALLED VA.GOV TO CHECK. I

03:06:03.018 --> 03:06:04.419
PERSONALLY HATE VA GOV BECAUSE

03:06:04.486 --> 03:06:06.522
IT ELICITS MORE QUESTIONS THAN

03:06:06.588 --> 03:06:08.624
IT DOES ANSWERS. RIGHT. SO THESE

03:06:08.690 --> 03:06:10.225
VETERANS ARE THEN COMING INTO

03:06:10.292 --> 03:06:10.926
OUR OFFICES BECAUSE WE'RE

03:06:10.993 --> 03:06:12.261
THEY'RE ASSIGNED WHERE THEY'RE

03:06:12.327 --> 03:06:13.462
WHERE THEY'RE ASSIGNED VA REP,

03:06:13.529 --> 03:06:15.163
WHERE WE THEN HAVE THE ANSWERS

03:06:15.230 --> 03:06:16.832
TO TELL THEM WHAT'S GOING ON

03:06:16.899 --> 03:06:18.500
WITH THEIR CLAIM, WHY THE VA IS

03:06:18.567 --> 03:06:19.434
SENDING THEM CERTAIN, CERTAIN

03:06:19.501 --> 03:06:20.369
THEM, CERTAIN SENDING THEM

03:06:20.435 --> 03:06:21.703
CERTAIN LETTERS, AND THEN ONCE,

03:06:21.770 --> 03:06:23.005
OF COURSE, ENCOURAGING THEM TO,

03:06:23.071 --> 03:06:24.806
TO ATTEND THEIR VA EXAMINATION.

03:06:24.873 --> 03:06:26.241
THAT IS PART OF THE CLAIMS

03:06:26.308 --> 03:06:28.810
PROCESS. OKAY. THANK YOU. I HAVE

03:06:28.877 --> 03:06:30.379
SOME QUESTIONS FOR THE

03:06:30.445 --> 03:06:31.747
OPPOSITION. WHAT PROTECTIONS DO

03:06:31.813 --> 03:06:33.048
YOU HAVE FOR THE VETERANS WHO

03:06:33.115 --> 03:06:34.917
TRUST YOUR COMPANIES CONSULTING

03:06:34.983 --> 03:06:36.485
SERVICES AND SIGN THE PAPERWORK,

03:06:36.552 --> 03:06:38.520
BUT ARE LATER REQUIRED TO PAY

03:06:38.587 --> 03:06:41.089
BACK SOME OR ALL OF THE BENEFITS

03:06:41.156 --> 03:06:41.623
RECEIVED DUE TO ERRONEOUS

03:06:41.690 --> 03:06:46.128
INFORMATION ON THE PAPERWORK. I

03:06:46.194 --> 03:06:48.030
WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT.

03:06:48.096 --> 03:06:48.630
NUMBER ONE, THAT IS SOMETHING

03:06:48.697 --> 03:06:51.466
THAT WE HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED.

03:06:51.533 --> 03:06:52.668
WE HONESTLY, TO THIS POINT, WE

03:06:52.734 --> 03:06:54.536
HAVE NOT HAD A VETERAN THAT'S

03:06:54.603 --> 03:06:56.238
WORKED WITH MY COMPANY, HAD ANY

03:06:56.305 --> 03:06:58.941
MONEY CLAWED BACK. WE HAVE HAD

03:06:59.007 --> 03:07:01.977
THERE ARE CASES WHERE VETERANS

03:07:02.044 --> 03:07:03.412
MEDICAL CONDITION WILL IMPROVE

03:07:03.478 --> 03:07:05.681
AND THEY'LL NO LONGER MEET THE

03:07:05.747 --> 03:07:08.250
CRITERIA TO RECEIVE BENEFITS.

03:07:08.317 --> 03:07:09.685
BUT TYPICALLY IF THAT'S THE

03:07:09.751 --> 03:07:11.286
CASE, WE WILL ASSIST THE VETERAN

03:07:11.353 --> 03:07:13.188
AT NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE. WE

03:07:13.255 --> 03:07:14.222
CONSIDER THAT PART OF THE

03:07:14.289 --> 03:07:16.391
ORIGINAL FEE TO ADDRESS ANY OF

03:07:16.458 --> 03:07:18.594
THOSE ISSUES WITH THE VA. BUT IF

03:07:18.660 --> 03:07:19.227
THE VA ULTIMATELY DETERMINES

03:07:19.294 --> 03:07:20.295
THAT THEY NO LONGER HAVE THE

03:07:20.362 --> 03:07:21.463
CONDITION BECAUSE THEY'RE

03:07:21.530 --> 03:07:23.265
THEY'VE GOTTEN TREATMENT,

03:07:23.332 --> 03:07:24.299
SOMETIMES THE BENEFITS CAN END.

03:07:24.366 --> 03:07:25.801
BUT WE HAVE NEVER SEEN MONEY

03:07:25.867 --> 03:07:27.235
CLAWED BACK BECAUSE OF A CLAIM

03:07:27.302 --> 03:07:28.637
THAT WE'VE WE'VE ASSISTED WITH.

03:07:28.704 --> 03:07:30.706
AND IF WE WERE TO FIND AN ERROR,

03:07:30.772 --> 03:07:32.307
I CAN TELL YOU JUST MY COMPANY,

03:07:32.374 --> 03:07:34.409
WE WOULD MAKE THE VETERAN WHOLE.

03:07:34.476 --> 03:07:36.511
AND ASSEMBLYWOMAN, IF I MAY

03:07:36.578 --> 03:07:38.347
RECALL, WITH VETERAN BENEFITS

03:07:38.413 --> 03:07:40.115
GUIDE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION,

03:07:40.182 --> 03:07:43.018
THE VA'S WHO DECIDES WHAT THE

03:07:43.085 --> 03:07:45.053
CLAIM, WHAT THE VETERAN IS

03:07:45.120 --> 03:07:46.188
ENTITLED TO. THEY'RE THE ONLY

03:07:46.254 --> 03:07:47.589
ONES WHO MAKE THAT DECISION. SO

03:07:47.656 --> 03:07:49.358
IF THERE WAS AN ERROR, THAT

03:07:49.424 --> 03:07:50.559
ERROR WOULD HAVE OCCURRED AT THE

03:07:50.626 --> 03:07:52.594
VA. IF THERE WAS AN ERROR DUE TO

03:07:52.661 --> 03:07:53.895
THE PAPERWORK THAT WE SUBMITTED,

03:07:53.962 --> 03:07:55.197
WELL, THEN THAT'S FRAUD. SO ARE

03:07:55.263 --> 03:07:58.133
WE TALKING ABOUT FRAUD OR ARE WE

03:07:58.200 --> 03:07:58.767
TALKING ABOUT A SIMPLE ERROR?

03:07:58.834 --> 03:08:00.102
AND WHEN A DECISION WAS MADE BY

03:08:00.168 --> 03:08:02.504
THE VA, I GUESS MY QUESTION IS,

03:08:02.571 --> 03:08:04.873
I MEAN, I'M SURE WE HAVE LOTS OF

03:08:04.940 --> 03:08:06.775
VETERANS THAT MISTAKES DO

03:08:06.842 --> 03:08:08.143
HAPPEN. AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE

03:08:08.210 --> 03:08:10.278
THE VETERAN IS NOT THE ONE

03:08:10.345 --> 03:08:11.146
PAYING THE ULTIMATE PRICE. SO

03:08:11.213 --> 03:08:12.914
THAT'S WHY I'M WANTING TO MAKE

03:08:12.981 --> 03:08:13.849
SURE THAT THERE'S SAFEGUARDS

03:08:13.915 --> 03:08:14.616
HERE, BECAUSE I'VE HEARD JUST

03:08:14.683 --> 03:08:15.550
ABSOLUTE HORROR STORIES. AND I'M

03:08:15.617 --> 03:08:17.052
NOT SAYING IT'S YOUR BUSINESS,

03:08:17.119 --> 03:08:18.487
BUT THERE ARE BAD ACTORS OUT

03:08:18.553 --> 03:08:20.355
THERE. I THINK YOU GUYS 100%

03:08:20.422 --> 03:08:21.890
WILL ADMIT THAT. MY NEXT

03:08:21.957 --> 03:08:23.258
QUESTION IS, IS WHEN YOU CHARGE

03:08:23.325 --> 03:08:25.193
THE VETERAN FOR YOUR SERVICE, IS

03:08:25.260 --> 03:08:27.562
IT PER AILMENT OR IS IT JUST PER

03:08:27.629 --> 03:08:29.998
FOR THE OVERALL APPLICATION FOR

03:08:30.065 --> 03:08:31.266
VETERANS GUARDIAN IT'S FOR THE

03:08:31.333 --> 03:08:32.668
OVERALL. IT'S BASED ON THE

03:08:32.734 --> 03:08:34.069
INCREASE IN THEIR COMPENSATION.

03:08:34.136 --> 03:08:36.638
SO WHETHER YOU DO ONE CLAIM OR

03:08:36.705 --> 03:08:37.706
TEN CLAIMS, IT'S BASED ON HOW

03:08:37.773 --> 03:08:39.741
MUCH WE OUR ASSISTANCE, HELP THE

03:08:39.808 --> 03:08:41.543
VETERAN GET ADDITIONAL BENEFITS.

03:08:41.610 --> 03:08:43.879
WE WORK STRICTLY ON A CONTINGENT

03:08:43.945 --> 03:08:44.846
BASIS. SO IF THE VETERAN DOES

03:08:44.913 --> 03:08:46.515
NOT GET AN INCREASE IN THEIR

03:08:46.581 --> 03:08:48.050
COMPENSATION, THERE IS NO FEE

03:08:48.116 --> 03:08:51.520
FULL STOP. IF THEY DO GET AN

03:08:51.586 --> 03:08:52.154
INCREASE IN THEIR BENEFITS. OUR

03:08:52.220 --> 03:08:53.588
FEE IS FIVE MONTHS OF THE

03:08:53.655 --> 03:08:54.956
INCREASE. THAT IS A ONE TIME

03:08:55.023 --> 03:08:57.225
FEE. WE DO NOT TOUCH BACK PAY.

03:08:57.292 --> 03:08:58.994
AND SO SOME OF THE ACCUSATIONS

03:08:59.061 --> 03:09:01.830
THAT WE'LL DRAG OUT A CLAIM

03:09:01.897 --> 03:09:02.931
UNNECESSARILY LONG THAT DOESN'T

03:09:02.998 --> 03:09:04.199
APPLY TO US, THAT ACTUALLY ONLY

03:09:04.266 --> 03:09:05.600
APPLIES TO THE ACCREDITED

03:09:05.667 --> 03:09:07.869
ATTORNEYS, NOT TO OUR INDUSTRY.

03:09:07.936 --> 03:09:10.505
WE ALSO DO NOT INVOICE UNTIL WE

03:09:10.572 --> 03:09:11.606
VALIDATED THAT THE VETERANS ARE

03:09:11.673 --> 03:09:13.308
GETTING THEIR NEW MONEY FROM THE

03:09:13.375 --> 03:09:15.444
VA, SO THAT ANY FEE THAT IS PAID

03:09:15.510 --> 03:09:16.712
TO US IS PAID WITH, WITH

03:09:16.778 --> 03:09:18.113
BENEFITS THAT THEY'RE THAT THEY

03:09:18.180 --> 03:09:20.782
WERE NOT RECEIVING BEFORE. AND

03:09:20.849 --> 03:09:22.551
WE OFFER MULTIPLE PAYMENT PLANS

03:09:22.617 --> 03:09:24.419
WITH NO INTEREST AND NO FEES.

03:09:24.486 --> 03:09:26.288
AND WE WOULD RECOMMEND IN OUR

03:09:26.354 --> 03:09:27.756
RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS TO THIS

03:09:27.823 --> 03:09:30.125
THAT WE CODIFY THOSE PRACTICES.

03:09:30.192 --> 03:09:32.394
IT ALSO ADDRESSING THE FRAUD

03:09:32.461 --> 03:09:34.696
ISSUE. WE ALSO WOULD RECOMMEND

03:09:34.763 --> 03:09:36.264
IN OUR RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS

03:09:36.331 --> 03:09:37.599
THAT WE GIVE THE VETERANS A

03:09:37.666 --> 03:09:40.202
RIGHT OF ACTION HERE IN

03:09:40.268 --> 03:09:41.903
CALIFORNIA, THAT IF WE DO DO

03:09:41.970 --> 03:09:44.339
SOMETHING WRONG, IF WE DO COMMIT

03:09:44.406 --> 03:09:45.774
FRAUD, THEN THE VETERAN COULD

03:09:45.841 --> 03:09:47.542
COME AFTER US. IN THE STATE

03:09:47.609 --> 03:09:49.578
COURTS, WE BELIEVE FUNDAMENTALLY

03:09:49.644 --> 03:09:50.812
IN PRESERVING THOSE RIGHTS, AND

03:09:50.879 --> 03:09:52.647
WE BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A WAY TO

03:09:52.714 --> 03:09:54.616
GET THERE BY ADDRESSING THE

03:09:54.683 --> 03:09:55.851
SPECIFIC ISSUES THAT WE'RE

03:09:55.917 --> 03:09:57.185
CONCERNED ABOUT, RATHER THAN

03:09:57.252 --> 03:09:58.653
JUST GETTING RID OF THE ENTIRE

03:09:58.720 --> 03:10:01.123
INDUSTRY. SO THAT'S ACTUALLY

03:10:01.189 --> 03:10:02.758
REALLY QUICKLY GO AHEAD. I JUST

03:10:02.824 --> 03:10:04.459
I THINK WHAT YOUR FIRST

03:10:04.526 --> 03:10:05.327
QUESTION, PART OF WHAT YOU'RE

03:10:05.393 --> 03:10:07.329
GETTING TO IS THE FIRST EXAMPLE

03:10:07.395 --> 03:10:09.498
THAT HE SHARED, WHEN SOMEONE

03:10:09.564 --> 03:10:13.702
STATUS CHANGES. AND SO WHAT WE

03:10:13.769 --> 03:10:15.270
HAVE SEEN IS THAT THEY STILL

03:10:15.337 --> 03:10:16.438
HAVE TO PAY THAT FULL AMOUNT. SO

03:10:16.505 --> 03:10:19.841
IF YOU OWE $20,000 AND SUDDENLY

03:10:19.908 --> 03:10:22.711
YOU'RE NOT ELIGIBLE ANYMORE FOR

03:10:22.778 --> 03:10:25.213
DISABILITY BENEFITS BECAUSE OF

03:10:25.280 --> 03:10:26.715
WHATEVER REASON, IF YOUR STATUS

03:10:26.782 --> 03:10:28.350
CHANGES OR IF YOU KNOW THERE WAS

03:10:28.416 --> 03:10:29.818
INCORRECT INFORMATION THAT WE'VE

03:10:29.885 --> 03:10:31.319
HAD INSTANCES THAT WE'VE HEARD

03:10:31.386 --> 03:10:34.156
OF, THE VA HAS GONE BACK AND

03:10:34.222 --> 03:10:36.625
AUDITED THE AUDIT APPLICATIONS,

03:10:36.691 --> 03:10:39.561
AND IF THEY FIND THEM TO BE

03:10:39.628 --> 03:10:40.996
INACCURATE, THEN THEY WILL LOWER

03:10:41.062 --> 03:10:42.831
THE AMOUNT THAT PEOPLE ARE

03:10:42.898 --> 03:10:44.666
APPROVED FOR. THEY STILL OWE

03:10:44.733 --> 03:10:46.034
WHATEVER THAT ORIGINAL AMOUNT

03:10:46.101 --> 03:10:47.335
IS, EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE GETTING

03:10:47.402 --> 03:10:50.071
A LOWER BENEFIT NOW. OKAY. AS

03:10:50.138 --> 03:10:51.606
YOU HAVE, MR. CHAIR, CAN I ASK

03:10:51.673 --> 03:10:54.075
JIM TO JUMP IN ON THAT AS WELL?

03:10:54.142 --> 03:10:57.512
JIM? SURE, YEAH. FOR AN EARLIER

03:10:57.579 --> 03:10:58.613
QUESTION IN LA COUNTY RIGHT NOW,

03:10:58.680 --> 03:11:00.816
YOU CAN WALK INTO BOB HOPE

03:11:00.882 --> 03:11:01.483
PATRIOTIC HALL FIVE DAYS A WEEK

03:11:01.550 --> 03:11:03.752
AND BE SEEN. SO WE WELCOME THE

03:11:03.819 --> 03:11:06.221
EXTRA TRAFFIC INTO OUR BUILDING

03:11:06.288 --> 03:11:07.722
TO ASSIST. ONE OTHER PIECE IS IN

03:11:07.789 --> 03:11:09.858
LA COUNTY. WE HAVE A INFORMATION

03:11:09.925 --> 03:11:12.027
HUB WHERE WE KNOW WE HAVE OVER

03:11:12.093 --> 03:11:13.428
40,000 SELF-IDENTIFIED VETERANS

03:11:13.495 --> 03:11:15.197
THAT ARE GOING TO SOCIAL

03:11:15.263 --> 03:11:16.331
SERVICES DEPARTMENT, GOING TO

03:11:16.398 --> 03:11:17.766
CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES. THIS

03:11:17.833 --> 03:11:19.935
WILL HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON YOUR

03:11:20.001 --> 03:11:20.769
COUNTIES BECAUSE WE WORK AS

03:11:20.836 --> 03:11:23.205
COUNTY VSOS TO GET IN FRONT OF

03:11:23.271 --> 03:11:24.306
THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND NOT JUST

03:11:24.372 --> 03:11:25.440
HELP THEM WITH THE CLAIM, BUT

03:11:25.507 --> 03:11:27.042
HELP THEM WITH EVERYTHING ELSE.

03:11:27.108 --> 03:11:28.476
WHERE THE FOR PROFIT COMPANIES

03:11:28.543 --> 03:11:30.278
TEND TO JUST HELP WITH THE CLAIM

03:11:30.345 --> 03:11:31.813
TO MAKE THE MONEY AND THEN

03:11:31.880 --> 03:11:33.248
THEY'RE DONE. WE'RE, YOU KNOW,

03:11:33.315 --> 03:11:34.616
TELLING THEM ABOUT THEIR FREE

03:11:34.683 --> 03:11:36.151
ACCESS TO PARKS, WHICH IS A

03:11:36.218 --> 03:11:37.285
GREAT STATE BENEFIT. WE'RE

03:11:37.352 --> 03:11:38.687
TELLING THEM ABOUT THEIR TUITION

03:11:38.753 --> 03:11:40.255
FEE WAIVER, WHICH IS AN AMAZING

03:11:40.322 --> 03:11:41.256
BENEFIT THAT THE STATE OFFERS

03:11:41.323 --> 03:11:43.592
THROUGH CALVET. SO THAT'S AND

03:11:43.658 --> 03:11:44.793
PEOPLE COME INTO COUNTIES.

03:11:44.860 --> 03:11:46.294
THEY'RE NOT HAVING A GOOD DAY.

03:11:46.361 --> 03:11:47.729
SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO

03:11:47.796 --> 03:11:49.431
PROTECT OUR VULNERABLE VETERANS,

03:11:49.497 --> 03:11:51.633
TO NOT HAVE THESE FOLKS OUT

03:11:51.700 --> 03:11:54.102
THERE OPERATING. I SAW THAT YOU

03:11:54.169 --> 03:11:56.738
HAD SOMETHING. YES I DID, WITH

03:11:56.805 --> 03:11:58.773
RESPECT TO DEBT. RECOUPMENT

03:11:58.840 --> 03:12:00.508
ASSEMBLYWOMAN, THAT IS NOT HOW

03:12:00.575 --> 03:12:01.710
THE VA ACTUALLY OPERATES. SO A

03:12:01.776 --> 03:12:03.879
CLEAR AND UNMISTAKABLE ERROR IS

03:12:03.945 --> 03:12:06.681
DEFINED IN VA LAW AND WOULD BE

03:12:06.748 --> 03:12:08.250
REQUIRED TO BE MET AND WOULD

03:12:08.316 --> 03:12:09.618
HAVE TO BE SHOWN THAT THE

03:12:09.684 --> 03:12:11.519
VETERAN PURPOSELY WITHHELD

03:12:11.586 --> 03:12:12.921
INFORMATION OR CONTRIBUTED TO

03:12:12.988 --> 03:12:14.990
FRAUD IN SOME WAY. OTHERWISE THE

03:12:15.056 --> 03:12:17.158
DECISION OF THE VA RESTS WITH

03:12:17.225 --> 03:12:18.126
THEM. IT IS THEIR

03:12:18.193 --> 03:12:19.261
RESPONSIBILITY. THEREFORE,

03:12:19.327 --> 03:12:20.462
RECOUPMENT WOULD NOT APPLY TO

03:12:20.528 --> 03:12:22.430
THAT VETERAN. SO ONLY IN VERY

03:12:22.497 --> 03:12:23.665
SPECIFIC CASES WOULD THE VETERAN

03:12:23.732 --> 03:12:25.600
HAVE TO RECOUP THAT AND WOULD BE

03:12:25.667 --> 03:12:27.535
CLEARLY DEFINED BY LAW IN

03:12:27.602 --> 03:12:29.504
EVIDENCE. I THINK THIS IS JUST

03:12:29.571 --> 03:12:31.206
FURTHER EVIDENCE THAT THIS IS A

03:12:31.273 --> 03:12:32.774
VERY COMPLEX ISSUE, THAT CLEARLY

03:12:32.841 --> 03:12:34.009
THERE'S LOTS OF CONVERSATIONS

03:12:34.075 --> 03:12:35.143
THAT HAVE BEEN HAD, AND I LOOK

03:12:35.210 --> 03:12:36.378
FORWARD TO HAVING MORE

03:12:36.444 --> 03:12:37.479
CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU BECAUSE I

03:12:37.545 --> 03:12:40.181
KNOW YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS.

03:12:40.248 --> 03:12:41.449
THE FINAL THING THAT I KEPT

03:12:41.516 --> 03:12:43.451
HEARING OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS

03:12:43.518 --> 03:12:44.953
WE NEED MORE REGULATION AND

03:12:45.020 --> 03:12:45.787
OVERSIGHT. SO I'M GOING TO START

03:12:45.854 --> 03:12:47.589
WITH YOU GUYS, BECAUSE IF YOU'RE

03:12:47.656 --> 03:12:48.390
SAYING YOU'RE ONE OF THE GOOD

03:12:48.456 --> 03:12:51.426
GUYS, I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU AT

03:12:51.493 --> 03:12:52.594
YOUR WORD AND YOU WANT TO BE

03:12:52.661 --> 03:12:53.662
REGULATED. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

03:12:53.728 --> 03:12:55.397
BECAUSE I WANT THE BAD GUYS OUT

03:12:55.463 --> 03:12:57.465
AND I DON'T WANT THEM OUT

03:12:57.532 --> 03:12:58.633
TOMORROW. I WANT THEM OUT RIGHT

03:12:58.700 --> 03:12:59.467
NOW. BECAUSE EVERY MINUTE THAT

03:12:59.534 --> 03:13:01.503
WE WAIT TO REGULATE, THIS IS

03:13:01.569 --> 03:13:02.237
ANOTHER VETERAN THAT'S BEING

03:13:02.304 --> 03:13:04.172
TAKEN ADVANTAGE. SO WHAT CAN WE

03:13:04.239 --> 03:13:05.440
DO? THERE'S TWO LEVELS OF THIS

03:13:05.507 --> 03:13:06.942
ISSUE. THE FIRST OF ALL THIS IS

03:13:07.008 --> 03:13:08.410
REALLY A FEDERAL ISSUE, RIGHT? I

03:13:08.476 --> 03:13:09.477
HAVE BEEN WORKING ACTIVELY FOR

03:13:09.544 --> 03:13:11.346
SIX YEARS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL

03:13:11.413 --> 03:13:12.814
TO REFORM ACCREDITATION, TO

03:13:12.881 --> 03:13:13.949
CREATE A PATH FOR US TO BECOME

03:13:14.015 --> 03:13:15.283
ACCREDITED, TO BE REGULATED BY

03:13:15.350 --> 03:13:17.319
THE VA, AND TO OPERATE WITHIN

03:13:17.385 --> 03:13:18.386
THE SYSTEM. THAT TOOK AN

03:13:18.453 --> 03:13:19.454
IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD IN APRIL

03:13:19.521 --> 03:13:21.957
OF THIS YEAR, WHEN THE CHOICE

03:13:22.023 --> 03:13:23.591
ACT WAS PASSED OUT OF THE HOUSE

03:13:23.658 --> 03:13:24.259
VETERAN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE AND IS

03:13:24.326 --> 03:13:25.794
NOW GOING TO BE CONSIDERED

03:13:25.860 --> 03:13:27.562
BEFORE THE FULL HOUSE. SO THAT'S

03:13:27.629 --> 03:13:29.764
STEP NUMBER ONE. I'VE GOT TO FIX

03:13:29.831 --> 03:13:30.565
THE ACCREDITATION SYSTEM AT THE

03:13:30.632 --> 03:13:32.500
FEDERAL LEVEL HERE AT THE STATE

03:13:32.567 --> 03:13:33.835
LEVEL, WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR

03:13:33.902 --> 03:13:35.770
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO FIGURE

03:13:35.837 --> 03:13:37.505
OUT THIS ISSUE. AND THAT'S WHO

03:13:37.572 --> 03:13:38.673
SHOULD BE FIGURING OUT THIS

03:13:38.740 --> 03:13:40.442
ISSUE. WHAT WE CAN DO IS PUT

03:13:40.508 --> 03:13:42.911
CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN PLACE,

03:13:42.978 --> 03:13:44.980
IDENTIFY EVERY PREDATORY

03:13:45.046 --> 03:13:48.249
PRACTICE OUT THERE. I AM OPEN TO

03:13:48.316 --> 03:13:49.384
BASICALLY ANYTHING THAT THE

03:13:49.451 --> 03:13:50.785
OPPOSITION IS IDENTIFIED. AND

03:13:50.852 --> 03:13:52.554
LET'S LEGISLATE AGAINST EVERY

03:13:52.620 --> 03:13:54.356
SINGLE ONE OF THOSE PRACTICES

03:13:54.422 --> 03:13:56.391
HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA,

03:13:56.458 --> 03:13:57.826
SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE SOME

03:13:57.892 --> 03:13:59.527
LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT, SOME LEVEL

03:13:59.594 --> 03:14:01.363
OF PROTECTION FOR VETERANS WHILE

03:14:01.429 --> 03:14:03.431
WE'RE WAITING FOR THE FEDERAL

03:14:03.498 --> 03:14:04.966
GOVERNMENT TO MAKE THAT

03:14:05.033 --> 03:14:07.669
DECISION. MR. CHAIR, YOU KNOW

03:14:07.736 --> 03:14:09.471
IT. AS I POINTED OUT EARLIER,

03:14:09.537 --> 03:14:13.141
THE GENTLEMAN HERE NO DOUBT THAT

03:14:13.208 --> 03:14:14.809
HE'S TRUSTWORTHY. HE'S AN

03:14:14.876 --> 03:14:16.277
OUTSTANDING VETERAN. I'VE GOT NO

03:14:16.344 --> 03:14:18.847
PROBLEM WITH THAT. AND IT SOUNDS

03:14:18.913 --> 03:14:20.849
LIKE HE'S IN THE PROCESS. LET'S

03:14:20.915 --> 03:14:22.350
LET THE PROCESS WORK ITS WAY

03:14:22.417 --> 03:14:24.185
OUT. IF HE'S GOING THROUGH THAT

03:14:24.252 --> 03:14:25.286
PROCESS WITH THE FEDERAL

03:14:25.353 --> 03:14:27.122
GOVERNMENT AND HE'S SEEKING

03:14:27.188 --> 03:14:28.256
ACCREDITATION, THAT'S GOING TO

03:14:28.323 --> 03:14:29.891
OPEN UP THE DOORS NOT ONLY FOR

03:14:29.958 --> 03:14:31.493
CALIFORNIA, BUT FOR OTHER STATES

03:14:31.559 --> 03:14:33.395
AS WELL. BUT UNTIL THEN, I THINK

03:14:33.461 --> 03:14:35.997
WE HAVE TO ACT NOW TO DO EXACTLY

03:14:36.064 --> 03:14:37.932
AS YOU SAID, PROTECT OUR

03:14:37.999 --> 03:14:40.468
VETERANS TODAY. THIS IS YEAR

03:14:40.535 --> 03:14:41.569
2025. IF YOU'RE GOING TO GET

03:14:41.636 --> 03:14:43.938
THIS DONE IN 26, I INVITE YOU TO

03:14:44.005 --> 03:14:46.074
COME BACK AND I WILL SPONSOR A

03:14:46.141 --> 03:14:49.144
BILL TO BE ABLE TO LICENSE THESE

03:14:49.210 --> 03:14:50.512
INDIVIDUALS TO PRACTICE IN

03:14:50.578 --> 03:14:51.813
CALIFORNIA. UNTIL THEN, THEY

03:14:51.880 --> 03:14:54.115
HAVE NO LICENSE TO PRACTICE IN

03:14:54.182 --> 03:14:55.984
CALIFORNIA UNDER FEDERAL LAW AND

03:14:56.051 --> 03:14:57.485
UNDER OUR DEPARTMENT. AND THIS

03:14:57.552 --> 03:14:59.154
IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY. AND

03:14:59.220 --> 03:15:01.022
WE ALSO HEARD SOMETHING THAT WE

03:15:01.089 --> 03:15:03.124
DIDN'T PRESENT EITHER ONE OF US,

03:15:03.191 --> 03:15:05.627
THAT WHEN THESE VETERANS GO IN

03:15:05.693 --> 03:15:06.761
TO VISIT THEIR COUNTY VETERAN

03:15:06.828 --> 03:15:09.297
SERVICE OFFICERS, IT'S NOT JUST

03:15:09.364 --> 03:15:10.698
FOR THEM, IT'S FOR THEIR

03:15:10.765 --> 03:15:12.000
FAMILIES, THEIR CHILDREN TO GO

03:15:12.067 --> 03:15:13.735
ON TO COLLEGE. PEOPLE DON'T KNOW

03:15:13.802 --> 03:15:15.703
THAT. CHALVET IF YOU'RE A

03:15:15.770 --> 03:15:17.672
QUALIFIED VETERAN, YOUR CHILDREN

03:15:17.739 --> 03:15:19.707
CAN GO TO COLLEGE FREE. WHERE

03:15:19.774 --> 03:15:21.509
DID THAT INFORMATION COME FROM?

03:15:21.576 --> 03:15:22.844
THE COUNTY VETERANS SERVICE

03:15:22.911 --> 03:15:25.080
OFFICER. IF YOUR FAMILY HAS

03:15:25.146 --> 03:15:26.948
ISSUES WITHIN THE COUNTY

03:15:27.015 --> 03:15:28.249
SERVICES OR WHATEVER IT MIGHT

03:15:28.316 --> 03:15:30.452
BE, THEY WILL GET IT THERE. SO

03:15:30.518 --> 03:15:33.321
IT'S NOT JUST ONE, BUT IT'S

03:15:33.388 --> 03:15:35.190
OPENING THE DOORS FOR OTHER

03:15:35.256 --> 03:15:36.691
VETERANS TO REALIZE THAT THEY

03:15:36.758 --> 03:15:38.426
CAN GO TO THEIR AMERICAN LEGION,

03:15:38.493 --> 03:15:40.195
AMVETS AND EVERY OTHER, THE RED

03:15:40.261 --> 03:15:41.796
CROSS, WHATEVER FOR SERVICES.

03:15:41.863 --> 03:15:43.832
AND THIS IS A MULTITUDE OF

03:15:43.898 --> 03:15:45.266
PEOPLE, BUT THEY HAVE DATA, THEY

03:15:45.333 --> 03:15:47.135
HAVE PROOF, THEY HAVE

03:15:47.202 --> 03:15:48.470
REGULATIONS, AND THAT'S WHAT

03:15:48.536 --> 03:15:49.904
WE'RE TRYING TO DO. ACCREDITED.

03:15:49.971 --> 03:15:51.506
COME ON, WE WELCOME YOU. BUT

03:15:51.573 --> 03:15:52.974
YOU'RE NOT. AND WE SHOULDN'T

03:15:53.041 --> 03:15:54.909
ALLOW THEM TO PRACTICE IN

03:15:54.976 --> 03:15:59.047
CALIFORNIA. I JUST THANK YOU

03:15:59.114 --> 03:16:00.615
ONCE AGAIN TO ALL OF OUR SERVICE

03:16:00.682 --> 03:16:02.317
MEN AND WOMEN IN THIS ROOM.

03:16:02.383 --> 03:16:04.085
VETERANS FIRST. I THINK THAT'S

03:16:04.152 --> 03:16:05.420
WHAT WE CAN ALL AGREE ON. SO

03:16:05.487 --> 03:16:06.588
THANK YOU, SENATOR, FOR BRINGING

03:16:06.654 --> 03:16:08.189
THIS FORWARD. AND I WILL MOVE

03:16:08.256 --> 03:16:10.058
THE BILL A MOTION. IS THERE A

03:16:10.125 --> 03:16:11.493
SECOND? WE HAVE A SECOND. I

03:16:11.559 --> 03:16:13.027
THINK SENATOR PAPINEAU'S GOING

03:16:13.094 --> 03:16:15.163
TO GO DOWN THE LINE, AND WE'RE

03:16:15.230 --> 03:16:16.531
HAVING A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH OF

03:16:16.598 --> 03:16:18.433
A FREE FLOWING CONVERSATION. SO

03:16:18.500 --> 03:16:19.534
IF WE CAN HAVE DIRECTED

03:16:19.601 --> 03:16:20.902
QUESTIONS TO INDIVIDUALS, THAT'D

03:16:20.969 --> 03:16:22.637
BE APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU, MR.

03:16:22.704 --> 03:16:26.741
CHAIR. I THINK WE CAN ALL

03:16:26.808 --> 03:16:27.542
STIPULATE THAT WE WANT WHAT'S

03:16:27.609 --> 03:16:30.545
BEST FOR OUR VETS. SO LET'S PUT

03:16:30.612 --> 03:16:32.413
THAT OUT THERE. AND I THANK

03:16:32.480 --> 03:16:33.381
EVERYBODY FOR WHAT THEY'RE

03:16:33.448 --> 03:16:35.316
TRYING TO DO FOR OUR VETS. SO MY

03:16:35.383 --> 03:16:36.417
QUESTION REALLY COMES DOWN TO

03:16:36.484 --> 03:16:40.288
THE SCOPE OF SERVICES. AND IS IT

03:16:40.355 --> 03:16:42.023
THAT AND I'LL POSE THIS TO THE

03:16:42.090 --> 03:16:43.958
OPPOSITION. FIRST, IS IT THAT

03:16:44.025 --> 03:16:45.360
THE SCOPE OF SERVICES THAT YOU

03:16:45.426 --> 03:16:48.196
ARE PROVIDING THE SAME SCOPE OF

03:16:48.263 --> 03:16:50.265
SERVICES THAT IS MANDATED AT THE

03:16:50.331 --> 03:16:53.968
FEDERAL LEVEL TO BE ACCREDITED?

03:16:54.035 --> 03:16:55.103
I THINK ACCREDITED IS THE WORD

03:16:55.170 --> 03:16:57.205
YOU'RE USING, NOT LICENSED, BUT

03:16:57.272 --> 03:16:59.040
ACCREDITED. SO LET ME ASK YOU

03:16:59.107 --> 03:17:00.141
THAT FIRST AND LET'S SEE WHAT

03:17:00.208 --> 03:17:02.110
YOU HAVE TO SAY. AND THEN I'M

03:17:02.177 --> 03:17:03.511
PROBABLY GOING TO COME BACK TO

03:17:03.578 --> 03:17:05.880
YOU ALL AS WELL. SO GO AHEAD. SO

03:17:05.947 --> 03:17:07.282
GO AHEAD. SO INSTEAD OF

03:17:07.348 --> 03:17:08.716
PROVIDING YOU WITH AN

03:17:08.783 --> 03:17:09.784
INTERPRETATION, I WILL RECITE TO

03:17:09.851 --> 03:17:11.286
YOU FEDERAL LAW WORD FOR WORD,

03:17:11.352 --> 03:17:13.788
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO TO GIVE

03:17:13.855 --> 03:17:15.623
ME A LAW STATES NO INDIVIDUAL

03:17:15.690 --> 03:17:16.224
MAY ASSIST CLAIMANTS IN THE

03:17:16.291 --> 03:17:17.392
PREPARATION, PRESENTATION AND

03:17:17.458 --> 03:17:18.826
PERSECUTION OF CLAIMS FOR VA

03:17:18.893 --> 03:17:21.696
BENEFITS AS AN AGENT OR

03:17:21.763 --> 03:17:23.464
ATTORNEY, UNLESS HE OR SHE HAS

03:17:23.531 --> 03:17:26.067
FIRST BEEN ACCREDITED BY THE VA

03:17:26.134 --> 03:17:28.703
FOR SUCH PURPOSES. WHY DID YOU

03:17:28.770 --> 03:17:31.072
SAY ASSIST AS AN AGENT OR

03:17:31.139 --> 03:17:32.173
ATTORNEY? CORRECT. SO THE

03:17:32.240 --> 03:17:33.141
QUALITY THERE'S A QUALIFIER.

03:17:33.208 --> 03:17:35.677
YES. SO IT SAYS PREPARATION,

03:17:35.743 --> 03:17:37.245
PRESENTATION, PERSECUTION OF

03:17:37.312 --> 03:17:38.746
CLAIMS FOR BENEFITS AS AN AGENT

03:17:38.813 --> 03:17:40.715
OR ATTORNEY. SO THE KEY

03:17:40.782 --> 03:17:42.617
QUALIFIER IS AGENT OR ATTORNEY.

03:17:42.684 --> 03:17:44.819
SO AN AGENT REPRESENTS THE

03:17:44.886 --> 03:17:47.589
VETERAN BEFORE THE VA OR AN

03:17:47.655 --> 03:17:48.389
ATTORNEY PROVIDES THEM WITH

03:17:48.456 --> 03:17:49.958
LEGAL SERVICES OR EVEN TAKES

03:17:50.024 --> 03:17:51.526
POWER OF ATTORNEY. WE DO NOT

03:17:51.593 --> 03:17:53.428
PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES. AND THAT

03:17:53.494 --> 03:17:55.129
IS WHY. WHAT IS IT THAT YOU'RE

03:17:55.196 --> 03:17:56.731
DOING THEN? YES. SO WE ASSIST

03:17:56.798 --> 03:17:58.233
THE VETERAN WITH THE PREPARING

03:17:58.299 --> 03:18:00.168
THE INFORMATION BEFORE IT'S

03:18:00.235 --> 03:18:02.103
SUBMITTED TO THE VA. SO WE'RE

03:18:02.170 --> 03:18:03.171
PROVIDING THEM WITH THE

03:18:03.238 --> 03:18:05.240
CONSULTING SERVICES. THERE'S A

03:18:05.306 --> 03:18:06.407
EIGHT STAGES. ONCE YOUR CLAIM

03:18:06.474 --> 03:18:08.910
GETS TO THE VA. AND THE THIRD

03:18:08.977 --> 03:18:11.446
STAGE IS WHAT WE PREPARE BEFORE

03:18:11.512 --> 03:18:13.514
IT GOES TO THE VA, WHICH IS

03:18:13.581 --> 03:18:15.516
TAKES THE MOST AMOUNT OF TIME,

03:18:15.583 --> 03:18:17.619
WHICH REDUCES THE TIME THAT A

03:18:17.685 --> 03:18:18.886
VETERAN WAITS TO RECEIVE THEIR

03:18:18.953 --> 03:18:21.155
CLAIM, THEIR DECISION BY 30 TO

03:18:21.222 --> 03:18:23.625
60 DAYS. SO THAT IS THE ONLY

03:18:23.691 --> 03:18:25.727
REASON WHY WE ARE NOT REQUIRED

03:18:25.793 --> 03:18:28.396
BY FEDERAL LAW TO BE ACCREDITED.

03:18:28.463 --> 03:18:30.365
HOWEVER, ONCE AND IF WE CHOOSE

03:18:30.431 --> 03:18:31.699
TO REPRESENT THAT VETERAN BEFORE

03:18:31.766 --> 03:18:33.668
THE VA, WE AND WE'RE NOT

03:18:33.735 --> 03:18:35.470
ACCREDITED, WE WOULD THEN BE IN

03:18:35.536 --> 03:18:37.338
VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW. SO I

03:18:37.405 --> 03:18:38.640
WANTED TO PROVIDE THAT VERY

03:18:38.706 --> 03:18:40.908
IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION THAT THE

03:18:40.975 --> 03:18:42.710
TRIGGER IS AS AN AGENT OR

03:18:42.777 --> 03:18:45.546
ATTORNEY. AND AGAIN, WE DO NOT

03:18:45.613 --> 03:18:47.782
PROVIDE SUCH SERVICES. AND MAY I

03:18:47.849 --> 03:18:51.019
JUMP IN? OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL

03:18:51.085 --> 03:18:53.521
HAS STIPULATED THEY ARE NOT

03:18:53.588 --> 03:18:54.956
OPERATING WITHIN CALIFORNIA

03:18:55.023 --> 03:18:57.959
STATE LAW BASED ON HIS

03:18:58.026 --> 03:18:59.294
UNDERSTANDING, BASED ON LAW. AND

03:18:59.360 --> 03:19:01.329
THAT'S WHY THE BILL IS HERE. AND

03:19:01.396 --> 03:19:03.164
AGAIN, WE INVITE THEM TO GET

03:19:03.231 --> 03:19:04.365
ACCREDITED. THAT'S NOT THE

03:19:04.432 --> 03:19:06.100
PROBLEM. LET'S LET THEM DO THAT.

03:19:06.167 --> 03:19:07.635
BUT LET'S MAKE SURE THAT WE

03:19:07.702 --> 03:19:08.770
PROTECT VETERANS HERE IN THE

03:19:08.836 --> 03:19:09.837
STATE OF CALIFORNIA, WHAT THEY

03:19:09.904 --> 03:19:12.573
DO OUTSIDE THE STATE. I HAVE NO

03:19:12.640 --> 03:19:15.109
BEARING ON, AND I'M SURE THEY DO

03:19:15.176 --> 03:19:17.345
VERY WELL MATHEMATICALLY, BUT I

03:19:17.412 --> 03:19:19.447
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR

03:19:19.514 --> 03:19:21.349
VETERANS ARE TAKEN CARE OF HERE

03:19:21.416 --> 03:19:23.451
IN CALIFORNIA. AND MY CO-CHAIR

03:19:23.518 --> 03:19:24.585
HAS A STATEMENT THAT WAS MY

03:19:24.652 --> 03:19:25.887
INITIAL STIPULATION. BUT GO

03:19:25.953 --> 03:19:29.090
AHEAD. THANK YOU. SO I THINK

03:19:29.157 --> 03:19:31.959
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS THAT

03:19:32.026 --> 03:19:34.195
IT'S A WORD GAME, RIGHT. WE'RE

03:19:34.262 --> 03:19:35.697
NOT GOING TO WE'RE NOT GOING TO

03:19:35.763 --> 03:19:37.365
CALL OURSELVES AN AGENT. WE'RE

03:19:37.432 --> 03:19:39.567
GOING TO CALL OURSELVES A

03:19:39.634 --> 03:19:42.103
CONSULTANT. BUT I THINK THE KEY

03:19:42.170 --> 03:19:43.538
WORDS ARE NOT ACTUALLY AGENT.

03:19:43.604 --> 03:19:46.007
THE KEY WORDS ARE PROHIBITS

03:19:46.074 --> 03:19:48.910
PREPARATION, PREPARATION OF

03:19:48.976 --> 03:19:52.146
DOCUMENTS, WHICH THEY SAID THEY

03:19:52.213 --> 03:19:53.681
SUBMIT PAPERWORK. THEY'RE

03:19:53.748 --> 03:19:55.483
ASSISTING WITH PREPARATION OF

03:19:55.550 --> 03:19:57.452
CLAIMS. THESE ARE THE WORDS THAT

03:19:57.518 --> 03:19:59.454
HE JUST SAID HIMSELF.

03:19:59.520 --> 03:20:00.488
PRESENTATION AND PROSECUTION OF

03:20:00.555 --> 03:20:03.658
ANY CLAIMS. SO YOU CANNOT DO ANY

03:20:03.725 --> 03:20:06.894
OF THOSE ACTIVITIES IF YOU ARE

03:20:06.961 --> 03:20:11.999
NOT A IF YOU ARE NOT ALREADY AN

03:20:12.066 --> 03:20:14.102
AGENT OF AND RECOGNIZED BY THE

03:20:14.168 --> 03:20:16.704
SECRETARY OF THE VA AND

03:20:16.771 --> 03:20:19.207
ACCREDITED. SO THIS IS YOU KNOW,

03:20:19.273 --> 03:20:22.477
I HAVE A CONTRACT HERE THAT OF A

03:20:22.543 --> 03:20:24.245
OF A DIFFERENT COMPANY, NOT THIS

03:20:24.312 --> 03:20:26.280
COMPANY, BUT WE HAVE A CONTRACT

03:20:26.347 --> 03:20:28.216
FROM SOMEONE WHO, YOU KNOW,

03:20:28.282 --> 03:20:30.218
SOUGHT OUT THEIR SERVICES. THEY

03:20:30.284 --> 03:20:33.588
HAVE A HIPAA, YOU SIGN OVER A

03:20:33.654 --> 03:20:36.057
HIPAA CLAIM TO ALLOW THEM TO GO

03:20:36.124 --> 03:20:38.593
GET HEALTH INFORMATION FROM

03:20:38.659 --> 03:20:40.728
HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. IF YOU ARE

03:20:40.795 --> 03:20:44.432
NOT REPRESENTING SOMEONE IN THAT

03:20:44.499 --> 03:20:45.800
SITUATION, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.

03:20:45.867 --> 03:20:47.568
AND THEY ALSO REQUIRE THAT THEY

03:20:47.635 --> 03:20:49.704
PAY THE PAYMENT WITHIN 30 DAYS

03:20:49.771 --> 03:20:51.506
OF RECEIPT OF THE INVOICE TO A

03:20:51.572 --> 03:20:53.374
QUESTION EARLIER. BUT YOU KNOW,

03:20:53.441 --> 03:20:56.244
THIS IS PAGES AND PAGES OF THEM

03:20:56.310 --> 03:20:58.379
REPRESENTING VETERANS AS AN

03:20:58.446 --> 03:21:00.214
AGENT AND OPERATING IN A WAY

03:21:00.281 --> 03:21:02.717
THAT IS CLEARLY ILLEGAL BASED ON

03:21:02.784 --> 03:21:04.685
FEDERAL LAW. AND AS YOU KNOW,

03:21:04.752 --> 03:21:07.088
THE SENATOR SAID, WE WOULD LOVE

03:21:07.155 --> 03:21:08.656
FOR THEM TO GET ACCREDITED. THE

03:21:08.723 --> 03:21:10.324
VALUE OF BEING ACCREDITED IS

03:21:10.391 --> 03:21:12.760
THAT THERE'S EXTENSIVE TRAINING

03:21:12.827 --> 03:21:16.464
BECAUSE IT IS A COMPLEX WEB OF,

03:21:16.531 --> 03:21:18.633
YOU KNOW, TO GO THROUGH A CLAIMS

03:21:18.699 --> 03:21:20.668
PROCESS AND APPLY. SO THERE'S A

03:21:20.735 --> 03:21:24.005
TRAINING THAT'S REQUIRED OF

03:21:24.071 --> 03:21:26.073
ACCREDITED FOLKS. AND THERE'S

03:21:26.140 --> 03:21:29.744
ALSO, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE THEY'RE

03:21:29.811 --> 03:21:31.712
ABLE TO HAVE TRANSPARENCY OVER

03:21:31.779 --> 03:21:33.648
THE WORK THAT THEY DO. THESE

03:21:33.714 --> 03:21:36.551
FOLKS ARE ARE RATED ON THEIR

03:21:36.617 --> 03:21:38.052
ABILITY TO PROCESS THESE CLAIMS

03:21:38.119 --> 03:21:40.922
AND THEIR SUCCESS RATE. THEY AS

03:21:40.988 --> 03:21:42.490
WAS SAID BEFORE, THEY CAN MAKE

03:21:42.557 --> 03:21:45.259
ALL KINDS OF CLAIMS, 99% SUCCESS

03:21:45.326 --> 03:21:46.661
RATE. THEY'RE ABLE TO CHERRY

03:21:46.727 --> 03:21:49.530
PICK PEOPLE VSOS HAVE TO SERVE

03:21:49.597 --> 03:21:50.898
EVERYONE. THEY'RE ABLE TO CHOOSE

03:21:50.965 --> 03:21:52.500
THE CLAIMS THAT THEY THINK ARE

03:21:52.567 --> 03:21:54.535
GOING TO BE THE MOST PROFITABLE

03:21:54.602 --> 03:21:56.838
VSOS EVERY CASE, NO MATTER HOW

03:21:56.904 --> 03:21:58.239
DIFFICULT IT IS, THEY COULD

03:21:58.306 --> 03:22:00.007
SPEND ONE HOUR HELPING SOMEONE

03:22:00.074 --> 03:22:02.109
AND GET $20,000, OR THEY COULD

03:22:02.176 --> 03:22:04.579
SPEND 5 OR 10 HOURS. THERE'S NO

03:22:04.645 --> 03:22:08.516
REAL STANDARDS AND NO REAL WAY

03:22:08.583 --> 03:22:10.284
TO SEE BEHIND THE CURTAIN, WHICH

03:22:10.351 --> 03:22:12.920
IS THE PROBLEM WITH THIS ILLEGAL

03:22:12.987 --> 03:22:14.422
BUSINESS, THESE ILLEGAL

03:22:14.489 --> 03:22:16.924
BUSINESSES THAT ARE OPERATING

03:22:16.991 --> 03:22:18.493
BASICALLY WITH NO TRANSPARENCY

03:22:18.559 --> 03:22:23.731
AND NO DAYLIGHT. I THINK ONE OF

03:22:23.798 --> 03:22:26.267
THE OTHER THINGS WE CAN PROBABLY

03:22:26.334 --> 03:22:27.301
STIPULATE TO IS THAT THE VA IS

03:22:27.368 --> 03:22:29.604
NO EASY TASK TO NEGOTIATE

03:22:29.670 --> 03:22:31.706
YOURSELF THROUGH THAT. SO THERE

03:22:31.772 --> 03:22:33.808
IS LISTEN, MY COUNTY IS GREAT AS

03:22:33.875 --> 03:22:35.409
CVSO AND I KNOW THEY'RE ALL

03:22:35.476 --> 03:22:36.811
DOING GREAT WORK. I DON'T THINK

03:22:36.878 --> 03:22:39.313
IT IS THE FAULT OF THE CVSO THAT

03:22:39.380 --> 03:22:41.048
WE MIGHT HAVE A GAP HERE IN

03:22:41.115 --> 03:22:41.983
PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO RECOVER

03:22:42.049 --> 03:22:43.684
THEIR BENEFITS. I THINK WE CAN

03:22:43.751 --> 03:22:45.686
ALL LOOK TO THE VA TO HAVE

03:22:45.753 --> 03:22:47.622
ACCOMPLISHED THAT QUITE WELL AND

03:22:47.688 --> 03:22:50.591
ON THEIR OWN. BUT. SO I DO HAVE

03:22:50.658 --> 03:22:53.261
SOME CONCERNS AND I AM GOING TO

03:22:53.327 --> 03:22:55.696
SUPPORT THE BILL, BUT I DO HAVE

03:22:55.763 --> 03:22:57.665
SOME CONCERNS ABOUT ELIMINATING

03:22:57.732 --> 03:22:59.400
SOME FOLKS THAT ARE OFFERING

03:22:59.467 --> 03:23:00.635
SERVICES THERE. STANDING BEFORE

03:23:00.701 --> 03:23:02.570
YOU SAYING REGULATE THE HECK OUT

03:23:02.637 --> 03:23:04.438
OF US, WE'LL DO THAT. BUT WHY

03:23:04.505 --> 03:23:06.674
AREN'T WE DOING THAT NOW? IT MAY

03:23:06.741 --> 03:23:08.109
BE I HAVE A FEELING YOU DON'T

03:23:08.175 --> 03:23:10.645
LIKE TO BE CERTIFIED BECAUSE

03:23:10.711 --> 03:23:11.312
THAT MAY RESTRICT YOUR FEES. NO.

03:23:11.379 --> 03:23:12.647
THEY ALL. WOULD YOU SAY NO? ON

03:23:12.713 --> 03:23:14.916
THE RECORD? I WOULD LIKE TO SAY

03:23:14.982 --> 03:23:16.350
NO. ABSOLUTELY AGREE TO A STATE

03:23:16.417 --> 03:23:17.785
REGISTRATION AND I CAN TELL YOU

03:23:17.852 --> 03:23:19.153
EVERYTHING IN DETAIL. THAT'S

03:23:19.220 --> 03:23:20.454
FINE. AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT

03:23:20.521 --> 03:23:22.256
CAPTAIN AND ALL KINDS OF GOOD

03:23:22.323 --> 03:23:23.357
STUFF. WE WOULD AGREE TO THAT AS

03:23:23.424 --> 03:23:26.494
WELL, I RECKON. YEAH. SO SOME OF

03:23:26.561 --> 03:23:27.762
THE THINGS THAT THAT I HAVE COME

03:23:27.828 --> 03:23:29.697
TO UNDERSTAND, THAT YOU WOULD

03:23:29.764 --> 03:23:31.432
ALLOW YOURSELVES TO BE REGULATED

03:23:31.499 --> 03:23:34.268
BY WAY OF CAPS, BY WAY OF HOLD

03:23:34.335 --> 03:23:37.004
ON. I HAVE TO PUT ON MY GLASSES.

03:23:37.071 --> 03:23:38.573
JUST A MOMENT. DISCLOSURE

03:23:38.639 --> 03:23:40.107
DOCUMENTS, LICENSING OR

03:23:40.174 --> 03:23:41.242
REGISTERING BY THE STATE PRIVATE

03:23:41.309 --> 03:23:42.810
RIGHT OF ACTION. ALL THOSE GOOD

03:23:42.877 --> 03:23:44.445
THINGS THAT WOULD. IF IN FACT,

03:23:44.512 --> 03:23:46.614
YOU'RE DOING THESE SERVICES. I

03:23:46.681 --> 03:23:48.015
THINK SOME OF THEM DOES MAKE A

03:23:48.082 --> 03:23:49.417
GOOD CASE. YOU KNOW, ONE MAN'S

03:23:49.483 --> 03:23:51.185
CONSULTATION IS ANOTHER MAN'S

03:23:51.252 --> 03:23:54.522
REPRESENTATION AND GOT A LITTLE

03:23:54.589 --> 03:23:58.459
BIT OF A PROBLEM THERE. BUT SO

03:23:58.526 --> 03:24:02.863
BUT I THE VA IS THE PITS AND NO

03:24:02.930 --> 03:24:04.899
NO NOTHING TO THE CVS. I'M LOVE

03:24:04.966 --> 03:24:06.801
THEM IN MY COUNTY. I CAN'T SAY

03:24:06.867 --> 03:24:08.102
ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT THEM.

03:24:08.169 --> 03:24:10.438
BUT WE GOT A GAP HERE AND I

03:24:10.504 --> 03:24:12.440
WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME

03:24:12.506 --> 03:24:16.243
ALTERNATIVE BECAUSE IT WE HAVE

03:24:16.310 --> 03:24:18.212
PEOPLE THAT FOUGHT FOR OUR

03:24:18.279 --> 03:24:19.313
COUNTRY, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES. IF

03:24:19.380 --> 03:24:21.215
WE CAN'T SERVE THEM, WHO ARE WE

03:24:21.282 --> 03:24:22.316
GOING TO SERVE? YEAH. OKAY.

03:24:22.383 --> 03:24:23.818
THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING ALL MY

03:24:23.884 --> 03:24:25.519
STUFF. I APPRECIATE IT. AND I

03:24:25.586 --> 03:24:26.487
WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE

03:24:26.554 --> 03:24:28.289
STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS DOING

03:24:28.356 --> 03:24:29.957
SOMETHING ABOUT IT. JIM, WOULD

03:24:30.024 --> 03:24:31.258
YOU TELL US HOW MUCH MONEY WAS

03:24:31.325 --> 03:24:32.293
ALLOCATED JUST RECENTLY BY THE

03:24:32.360 --> 03:24:34.095
STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR THE

03:24:34.161 --> 03:24:35.963
VSOS? YEAH. SO WE'RE UP TO $11

03:24:36.030 --> 03:24:37.198
MILLION IN SUBVENTION, WHICH

03:24:37.264 --> 03:24:40.167
EQUATES TO AROUND $70 PER CLAIM.

03:24:40.234 --> 03:24:42.036
SO WHAT THE STATE HAS AN OPTION

03:24:42.103 --> 03:24:43.337
TO DO AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

03:24:43.404 --> 03:24:45.673
HAS AN OPTION TO DO IS TO FUND

03:24:45.740 --> 03:24:48.542
US MORE. AND SO THAT SO THAT. SO

03:24:48.609 --> 03:24:50.311
THAT WAY VETERANS DON'T HAVE TO

03:24:50.378 --> 03:24:51.579
PAY. THEY DON'T HAVE TO. AND THE

03:24:51.646 --> 03:24:54.215
THING IS, IS, YOU KNOW, WE AS A

03:24:54.281 --> 03:24:55.282
SOCIAL WORKER STRAIGHT OUT OF

03:24:55.349 --> 03:24:56.684
SCHOOL, LIKE WE WOULD HELP EACH

03:24:56.751 --> 03:24:58.285
OTHER ON THE SIDE OF THE

03:24:58.352 --> 03:24:59.253
BUILDING, JUST, HEY, WHERE'S

YOUR CLAIM AT? YOU KNOW, WE DO

03:25:01.088 --> 03:25:03.457
IT FOR FREE. WE TAKE CARE OF OUR

03:25:03.524 --> 03:25:05.493
OWN. AND, YOU KNOW, THIS IS KIND

03:25:05.559 --> 03:25:06.327
OF ALL JUST, YOU KNOW, I DON'T

03:25:06.394 --> 03:25:08.095
UNDERSTAND WHY WE GOT HERE, BUT

03:25:08.162 --> 03:25:10.765
WE'RE HERE. SO THE WORK I'VE

03:25:10.831 --> 03:25:11.666
DONE AS CHAIR OF THE MILITARY

03:25:11.732 --> 03:25:12.299
AND VETERANS COMMITTEE WAS TO

03:25:12.366 --> 03:25:13.434
GET THOSE PROCEEDS TO OUR

03:25:13.501 --> 03:25:15.503
VETERANS AND TO THE ENTIRE STATE

03:25:15.569 --> 03:25:16.237
OF CALIFORNIA, ALL THE VETERAN

03:25:16.303 --> 03:25:17.505
SERVICE OFFICERS. SO THAT MONEY

03:25:17.571 --> 03:25:18.472
WAS REQUESTED. WE STARTED WITH A

03:25:18.539 --> 03:25:20.941
MILLION, GOT TO FIVE. NOW WE'RE

03:25:21.008 --> 03:25:22.576
AT 11. AND SO WE ARE RECOGNIZING

03:25:22.643 --> 03:25:24.412
THE FACT THAT WE NEED TRAINED

03:25:24.478 --> 03:25:25.579
PROFESSIONALS IN WITHIN THE

03:25:25.646 --> 03:25:26.947
SYSTEM. SO WE ARE DOING

03:25:27.014 --> 03:25:28.449
SOMETHING CALIFORNIA. WE'RE NOT

03:25:28.516 --> 03:25:30.251
SITTING WAITING, WE'RE DOING

03:25:30.317 --> 03:25:31.986
SOMETHING. AND AS SOON AS THESE

03:25:32.053 --> 03:25:34.221
INDIVIDUALS GET THEIR

03:25:34.288 --> 03:25:35.156
COMPLETION, AS THEY'RE GOING

03:25:35.222 --> 03:25:36.791
THROUGH, THEN WE WELCOME. AND AS

03:25:36.857 --> 03:25:38.492
I SAID, I WILL HELP THEM GET

03:25:38.559 --> 03:25:40.227
THEIR LICENSE IN CALIFORNIA. AND

03:25:40.294 --> 03:25:42.663
UNTIL THEN, WE'VE GOT TO PROTECT

03:25:42.730 --> 03:25:44.265
OUR VETERANS AND GO FORWARD.

03:25:44.331 --> 03:25:46.801
THANK YOU. OKAY. ASSEMBLYMEMBER

03:25:46.867 --> 03:25:49.637
STEPHANIE, THANK YOU. I WANT TO

03:25:49.704 --> 03:25:50.371
THANK SENATOR ARCHULETA FOR

03:25:50.438 --> 03:25:52.139
BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND

03:25:52.206 --> 03:25:54.475
TO ASSEMBLY MEMBERS FOR

03:25:54.542 --> 03:25:56.544
COAUTHORING IT. YOU KNOW, I, I

03:25:56.610 --> 03:25:59.647
HAVE SUCH RESPECT FOR VETERANS.

03:25:59.714 --> 03:26:01.248
I AM THE PROUD DAUGHTER OF A

03:26:01.315 --> 03:26:02.283
VIETNAM VETERAN, OF FIRST

03:26:02.349 --> 03:26:04.185
LIEUTENANT IN THE ARMY, WHO

03:26:04.251 --> 03:26:06.987
SERVED IN THE ARMY FOR TWO YEARS

03:26:07.054 --> 03:26:09.890
OR FOUR YEARS, TWO YEARS, ONE

03:26:09.957 --> 03:26:10.524
YEAR IN VIETNAM AND THEN THREE

03:26:10.591 --> 03:26:15.262
YEARS AT HOME. AND IT'S JUST MY

03:26:15.329 --> 03:26:16.297
FEELING THAT VETERANS SHOULDN'T

03:26:16.363 --> 03:26:18.499
HAVE TO PAY ONE PENNY AT ALL FOR

03:26:18.566 --> 03:26:20.334
ANY OF THESE SERVICES. AND I

03:26:20.401 --> 03:26:22.336
DON'T LIKE SEEING VETERANS ON

03:26:22.403 --> 03:26:23.871
TWO SIDES OF AN ISSUE, BECAUSE I

03:26:23.938 --> 03:26:25.306
THINK THERE ARE GOOD PEOPLE

03:26:25.372 --> 03:26:26.707
TRYING TO HELP THOSE VETS. AND

03:26:26.774 --> 03:26:28.476
WHEN I WAS ON THE BOARD OF

03:26:28.542 --> 03:26:29.310
SUPERVISORS, I PASSED A

03:26:29.376 --> 03:26:30.778
RESOLUTION THAT DEMANDED SAN

03:26:30.845 --> 03:26:32.379
FRANCISCO HIRE COUNTY VETERANS

03:26:32.446 --> 03:26:34.081
SERVICE OFFICER WHEN THAT

03:26:34.148 --> 03:26:35.583
POSITION WAS VACANT. TOO LONG.

03:26:35.649 --> 03:26:36.517
AND IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE AL

03:26:36.584 --> 03:26:38.285
SIMMS, I THINK, I DON'T KNOW IF

03:26:38.352 --> 03:26:40.154
HE'S STILL IN THE AUDIENCE. WE

03:26:40.221 --> 03:26:42.256
WERE ABLE TO HIRE HIM BECAUSE OF

03:26:42.323 --> 03:26:43.424
IT. WE NOW LOST HIM TO ANOTHER

03:26:43.491 --> 03:26:45.493
COUNTY, AND THAT'S SAN

03:26:45.559 --> 03:26:46.160
FRANCISCO'S LOSS. BUT, YOU KNOW,

03:26:46.227 --> 03:26:50.097
I JUST I HAVE SUCH COMPASSION

03:26:50.164 --> 03:26:52.166
FOR VETS. AND AGAIN, I WANT TO

03:26:52.233 --> 03:26:53.234
THANK EVERY SERVICE MEMBER,

03:26:53.300 --> 03:26:55.536
ACTIVE AND VET IN THIS ROOM THAT

03:26:55.603 --> 03:26:58.405
HAS SERVED WHAT WE PUT THEM

03:26:58.472 --> 03:26:59.907
THROUGH WHEN THEY COME HOME IS

03:26:59.974 --> 03:27:01.976
JUST ABHORRENT. AND IT SHOULD

03:27:02.042 --> 03:27:05.246
NOT BE THIS DIFFICULT FOR THEM

03:27:05.312 --> 03:27:07.748
TO GET THE SERVICES AND THE AND

03:27:07.815 --> 03:27:11.352
THE COMPENSATION THEY SO RIGHTLY

03:27:11.418 --> 03:27:13.454
DESERVE. MY FATHER WAS IN AN

03:27:13.521 --> 03:27:15.289
AREA MOST HEAVILY SPRAYED WITH

03:27:15.356 --> 03:27:17.792
AGENT ORANGE, AND HE IS NOW

03:27:17.858 --> 03:27:19.326
SUFFERING FROM LEWY BODY

03:27:19.393 --> 03:27:20.895
DEMENTIA FOR SEVEN AND A HALF

03:27:20.961 --> 03:27:22.830
YEARS NOW, AND EVERY SINGLE

03:27:22.897 --> 03:27:24.331
PERSON IN HIS BUNKER EITHER HAD

03:27:24.398 --> 03:27:26.534
SOME TYPE OF CANCER OR

03:27:26.600 --> 03:27:28.969
PARKINSON'S. HALF OF THEM HAVE

03:27:29.036 --> 03:27:31.539
PASSED. MY DAUGHTER, MY DAD IS

03:27:31.605 --> 03:27:34.575
81 YEARS OLD, AND I JUST THINK

03:27:34.642 --> 03:27:36.143
WE NEED TO BE DOING EVERYTHING

03:27:36.210 --> 03:27:37.645
POSSIBLE TO MAKE SURE VETERANS

03:27:37.711 --> 03:27:39.580
AREN'T TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. I

03:27:39.647 --> 03:27:41.148
THINK THIS BILL ACCOMPLISHES

03:27:41.215 --> 03:27:43.184
THAT. I DO SEE THE GRAY AREAS IN

03:27:43.250 --> 03:27:44.785
WHICH SOME OF THESE GOOD, YOU

03:27:44.852 --> 03:27:46.720
KNOW, VETERANS OVER HERE ARE

03:27:46.787 --> 03:27:48.255
OPERATING IN THAT I THINK WE

03:27:48.322 --> 03:27:50.591
NEED TO FIX. AND I RESPECT

03:27:50.658 --> 03:27:53.194
SENATOR ARCHULETA'S COMMITMENT

03:27:53.260 --> 03:27:55.696
TO THAT. AND I JUST DO THINK

03:27:55.763 --> 03:27:58.098
THAT WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING

03:27:58.165 --> 03:27:59.934
RIGHT NOW TO MAKE CERTAIN

03:28:00.000 --> 03:28:01.402
VETERANS ARE NOT TAKEN ADVANTAGE

03:28:01.468 --> 03:28:03.571
OF, AND THE BAD ACTORS ARE

03:28:03.637 --> 03:28:05.439
PROBABLY RUINING IT FOR THE GOOD

03:28:05.506 --> 03:28:07.208
PEOPLE THAT ARE TRYING TO HELP.

03:28:07.274 --> 03:28:08.576
BUT AGAIN, I DON'T THINK THAT

03:28:08.642 --> 03:28:10.544
VETS SHOULD HAVE TO PAY ONE

03:28:10.611 --> 03:28:12.646
PENNY FOR THESE SERVICES TO

03:28:12.713 --> 03:28:14.348
ANYONE, AND IT'S ON US TO MAKE

03:28:14.415 --> 03:28:15.583
SURE THAT THEY DON'T. I THINK

03:28:15.649 --> 03:28:18.719
THIS BILL IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT

03:28:18.786 --> 03:28:19.854
DIRECTION, AND I WOULD LOVE TO

03:28:19.920 --> 03:28:21.589
BE ADDED AS A COAUTHOR. AND I

03:28:21.655 --> 03:28:22.990
WANT TO THANK, TOO, SENATOR

03:28:23.057 --> 03:28:24.558
ARCHULETA, FOR ONE OF THE BEST

03:28:24.625 --> 03:28:26.227
THINGS I'VE DONE. I'M A FRESHMAN

03:28:26.293 --> 03:28:27.795
LEGISLATOR HERE. ONE OF THE BEST

03:28:27.862 --> 03:28:30.197
THINGS I'VE DONE HERE WAS THAT

03:28:30.264 --> 03:28:32.032
WEEKEND IN SAN DIEGO WITH YOU

03:28:32.099 --> 03:28:33.934
AND SOME OTHER MEMBERS, WHERE WE

03:28:34.001 --> 03:28:35.936
WATCHED THE MARINES GRADUATE

03:28:36.003 --> 03:28:38.405
FROM THAT OVER 500 MARINES

03:28:38.472 --> 03:28:40.941
GRADUATED. WE WERE ON THAT NAVY

03:28:41.008 --> 03:28:42.509
SHIP. WE WATCHED THE COAST

03:28:42.576 --> 03:28:44.578
GUARD. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU

03:28:44.645 --> 03:28:45.346
FOR THAT EXPERIENCE, BECAUSE IT

03:28:45.412 --> 03:28:47.548
JUST REMINDED ME OF THE ISSUES

03:28:47.615 --> 03:28:48.983
THAT PEOPLE ARE FACING WHILE IN

03:28:49.049 --> 03:28:50.918
THE MILITARY, AND ALSO WHEN THEY

03:28:50.985 --> 03:28:52.753
GET OUT AND THE VETS. THE ISSUES

03:28:52.820 --> 03:28:54.288
THAT WE DISCUSSED THAT VETERANS

03:28:54.355 --> 03:28:55.389
ARE FACING THAT A LOT OF US

03:28:55.456 --> 03:28:57.591
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IN THAT

03:28:57.658 --> 03:28:59.093
WEEKEND. WE GOT TO SEE THOSE

03:28:59.159 --> 03:29:00.895
ISSUES UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL. WE

03:29:00.961 --> 03:29:03.397
GOT TO HEAR FROM THOSE VETERANS

03:29:03.464 --> 03:29:05.299
THAT ARE TRYING TO MAKE A LIVING

03:29:05.366 --> 03:29:07.268
HERE IN CALIFORNIA AFTER THEIR

03:29:07.334 --> 03:29:10.638
SERVICE. AND AGAIN, IT'S AN IT'S

03:29:10.704 --> 03:29:11.906
AN ISSUE THAT I'M PASSIONATE

03:29:11.972 --> 03:29:12.973
ABOUT. I'M EMOTIONAL ABOUT

03:29:13.040 --> 03:29:14.842
BECAUSE IT AFFECTS MY FATHER,

03:29:14.909 --> 03:29:16.243
ALL HIS FRIENDS. IT WAS MY

03:29:16.310 --> 03:29:18.646
VIETNAM. IT WAS MY DAD'S VIETNAM

03:29:18.712 --> 03:29:19.580
BUDDIES WHO WERE THERE FOR HIM

03:29:19.647 --> 03:29:21.582
WHEN HE WOULDN'T GO GET SEEN.

03:29:21.649 --> 03:29:22.783
FOR LEWY BODY DEMENTIA, ONE FLEW

03:29:22.850 --> 03:29:25.653
IN FROM COLORADO TO GET HIM TO

03:29:25.719 --> 03:29:27.187
GO TO UCSF, THE MEMORY CARE

03:29:27.254 --> 03:29:29.990
CENTER. IT WAS ONE OF HIS

03:29:30.057 --> 03:29:31.091
VIETNAM BUDDIES THAT CALLED ME

03:29:31.158 --> 03:29:33.093
AND SAID, YOUR DAD NEEDS TO BE

03:29:33.160 --> 03:29:34.595
GETTING BENEFITS FROM THE VA.

03:29:34.662 --> 03:29:37.197
YEAH. AND I JUST I HAVE SO MUCH

03:29:37.264 --> 03:29:38.666
RESPECT FOR PEOPLE WHO SERVE. I

03:29:38.732 --> 03:29:40.734
CAN'T SAY ENOUGH OR DO ENOUGH.

03:29:40.801 --> 03:29:42.336
AND I THINK THIS BILL IS A STEP

03:29:42.403 --> 03:29:44.405
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I DO

03:29:44.471 --> 03:29:45.806
WANT TO RESPECT THE OPPOSITION,

03:29:45.873 --> 03:29:47.908
MAKE SURE THAT SOMEHOW WE FIND A

03:29:47.975 --> 03:29:49.476
WAY TO INCLUDE THEM IN WHAT I

03:29:49.543 --> 03:29:50.778
THINK THEY'RE LEGITIMATELY

03:29:50.844 --> 03:29:51.512
TRYING TO DO, THOSE THAT ARE

03:29:51.578 --> 03:29:53.781
HERE TODAY AND HELPING OUR VETS.

03:29:53.847 --> 03:29:54.548
BUT AGAIN, THANK YOU FOR

03:29:54.615 --> 03:29:56.750
BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I WILL

03:29:56.817 --> 03:29:58.385
BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY AND WOULD

03:29:58.452 --> 03:29:59.653
LOVE TO BE A COAUTHOR. THANK

03:29:59.720 --> 03:30:01.388
YOU, THANK YOU. AND NEXT UP WE

03:30:01.455 --> 03:30:04.191
HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER ZIPPER. SO

03:30:04.258 --> 03:30:05.459
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL

03:30:05.526 --> 03:30:07.361
TODAY. OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW, MY

03:30:07.428 --> 03:30:10.297
DAD TOO WAS A AS A VETERAN, A

03:30:10.364 --> 03:30:12.366
DISABLED VETERAN. HE ACTUALLY

03:30:12.433 --> 03:30:13.968
CONTRACTED RHEUMATIC FEVER WHEN

03:30:14.034 --> 03:30:15.970
HE SERVED IN KOREA. AND THAT LED

03:30:16.036 --> 03:30:17.204
TO HEART A HEART CONDITION THAT

03:30:17.271 --> 03:30:18.572
PLAGUED HIM HIS ENTIRE LIFE. AND

03:30:18.639 --> 03:30:22.142
HE DIED OF IT IN THE END. AND I

03:30:22.209 --> 03:30:26.113
REMEMBER THE AS A KID, HIM

03:30:26.180 --> 03:30:27.848
NAVIGATING THE VETERANS

03:30:27.915 --> 03:30:29.783
ADMINISTRATION THROUGH DIFFERENT

03:30:29.850 --> 03:30:31.185
ADMINISTRATIONS. SOMETIMES IT

03:30:31.251 --> 03:30:32.619
WAS EASIER DURING THE REAGAN

03:30:32.686 --> 03:30:33.520
ADMINISTRATION. IT WAS REALLY

03:30:33.587 --> 03:30:37.057
HARD. AND I JUST I THINK THAT WE

03:30:37.124 --> 03:30:38.459
SHOULD BE DOING EVERYTHING WE

03:30:38.525 --> 03:30:41.161
CAN TO HELP VETERANS NAVIGATE

03:30:41.228 --> 03:30:43.030
THAT SYSTEM AND GET THE SERVICES

03:30:43.097 --> 03:30:46.000
AND THE BENEFITS THAT THEY NEED.

03:30:46.066 --> 03:30:48.102
I HAD A QUESTION FOR THE IF IT'S

03:30:48.168 --> 03:30:50.004
POSSIBLE FOR THE FOR THE

03:30:50.070 --> 03:30:51.472
OPPONENTS. SO WHY IS IT THAT

03:30:51.538 --> 03:30:52.840
YOU'RE THAT YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO

03:30:52.906 --> 03:30:55.275
GET ACCREDITED? SO UNDER THE

03:30:55.342 --> 03:30:56.810
CURRENT ACCREDITATION IN 2000,

03:30:56.877 --> 03:30:58.946
PRIOR TO 2006, NO ONE WAS

03:30:59.013 --> 03:31:00.347
ALLOWED TO CHARGE A FEE TO

03:31:00.414 --> 03:31:02.049
PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO VETERANS.

03:31:02.116 --> 03:31:04.284
IN 2006, WHEN THEY CHANGED THE

03:31:04.351 --> 03:31:06.286
LAW, THEY ALLOWED LAWYERS TO

03:31:06.353 --> 03:31:08.856
COME IN AND ACCREDITED AGENTS TO

03:31:08.922 --> 03:31:11.592
CHARGE A FEE TO ASSIST WITH

03:31:11.658 --> 03:31:12.626
APPEALS. AND SO THERE IS A

03:31:12.693 --> 03:31:14.461
SYSTEM WHERE VETERANS ARE PAYING

03:31:14.528 --> 03:31:15.429
FOR ASSISTANCE UNDER THE

03:31:15.496 --> 03:31:17.231
ACCREDITATION MODEL TO WORK ON

03:31:17.297 --> 03:31:19.500
APPEALS, BUT THEY MAINTAIN THE

03:31:19.566 --> 03:31:22.069
MORATORIUM FOR ACCREDITED AGENTS

03:31:22.136 --> 03:31:23.404
TO CHARGE A FEE TO HELP WITH

03:31:23.470 --> 03:31:25.339
INITIAL CLAIMS. SO THE REASON

03:31:25.406 --> 03:31:26.974
THAT WE CAN'T GET ACCREDITED

03:31:27.041 --> 03:31:29.543
RIGHT NOW IS BECAUSE OUR WHOLE

03:31:29.610 --> 03:31:31.445
THE WAY WE LOOK AT PROVIDING

03:31:31.512 --> 03:31:32.546
ASSISTANCE IS I WANT TO HELP

03:31:32.613 --> 03:31:34.014
VETERANS ACROSS THE BOARD,

03:31:34.081 --> 03:31:35.516
THINGS THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE

03:31:35.582 --> 03:31:36.417
CLAIMED THAT THEY DIDN'T,

03:31:36.483 --> 03:31:37.217
SECONDARY CONDITIONS, BOTH OF

03:31:37.284 --> 03:31:39.353
WHICH ARE INITIAL CLAIMS AND

03:31:39.420 --> 03:31:41.221
WITH THINGS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN

03:31:41.288 --> 03:31:42.189
DENIED FOR OR ARE UNDERRATED. IF

03:31:42.256 --> 03:31:43.590
I'M ACCREDITED, I CAN ONLY

03:31:43.657 --> 03:31:45.359
ASSIST WITH THAT LAST CATEGORY,

03:31:45.426 --> 03:31:46.827
AND THAT'S LESS THAN 10% OF THE

03:31:46.894 --> 03:31:49.263
WORK THAT I DO. AND SO I AM

03:31:49.329 --> 03:31:50.631
BETTER SERVING MY VETERANS,

03:31:50.697 --> 03:31:51.732
OPERATING AS AN UNACCREDITED

03:31:51.799 --> 03:31:53.667
ENTITY BECAUSE I'M CAPABLE OF

03:31:53.734 --> 03:31:55.736
LOOKING AT THEM HOLISTICALLY. I

03:31:55.803 --> 03:31:58.005
WANT TO CHANGE THE ACCREDITATION

03:31:58.072 --> 03:31:59.973
RULES TO ALLOW US TO BECOME

03:32:00.040 --> 03:32:00.707
ACCREDITED. THAT'S WHAT THE

03:32:00.774 --> 03:32:02.376
CHOICE ACT DOES. THAT'S THE

03:32:02.443 --> 03:32:03.277
DIRECTION THAT THE FEDERAL

03:32:03.343 --> 03:32:04.978
GOVERNMENT IS HEADING, BUT IT'S

03:32:05.045 --> 03:32:06.346
GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME FOR THEM

03:32:06.413 --> 03:32:08.415
TO GET THERE. IF WE LOOK AT JUST

03:32:08.482 --> 03:32:10.784
PUTTING A BAN ON US LIKE THIS

03:32:10.851 --> 03:32:14.054
BILL DOES, IT IS GOING A STEP

03:32:14.121 --> 03:32:16.156
FURTHER THAN CURRENT FEDERAL LAW

03:32:16.223 --> 03:32:17.958
GOES. WE ARE GOING PAST WHAT

03:32:18.025 --> 03:32:20.027
FEDERAL LAW CURRENTLY SAYS A

03:32:20.094 --> 03:32:22.596
BETTER WAY TO PROTECT VETERANS

03:32:22.663 --> 03:32:25.499
IS TO GO WITH OUR AMENDMENTS,

03:32:25.566 --> 03:32:27.601
WHERE WE LEGISLATE AGAINST THE

03:32:27.668 --> 03:32:28.869
PRACTICES, WHILE WE'RE WAITING

03:32:28.936 --> 03:32:30.170
FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO

03:32:30.237 --> 03:32:32.005
MAKE THE DECISION ON WHAT

03:32:32.072 --> 03:32:32.606
ACCREDITATION IS GOING TO LOOK

03:32:32.673 --> 03:32:34.908
LIKE GOING FORWARD. SO WHEN WE

03:32:34.975 --> 03:32:40.013
WERE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE

03:32:40.080 --> 03:32:41.782
CATEGORIES OF SERVICES THAT ARE

03:32:41.849 --> 03:32:45.319
PROVIDED ASSISTING, I THINK THE

03:32:45.385 --> 03:32:47.688
LIST THAT SOME OF THE MEMBERS

03:32:47.754 --> 03:32:51.191
RAISED, THAT IS YOU'RE ONLY ABLE

03:32:51.258 --> 03:32:54.228
TO GET ACCREDITED FOR PROVIDING

03:32:54.294 --> 03:32:56.163
THOSE SERVICES ON ESSENTIALLY ON

03:32:56.230 --> 03:32:58.031
AN APPEAL. IS THAT RIGHT? NO. SO

03:32:58.098 --> 03:33:00.934
YOU CAN ONLY BE ACCREDITED AND

03:33:01.001 --> 03:33:01.969
TO CHARGE. WELL, NO. BUT THE

03:33:02.035 --> 03:33:03.403
IMPORTANT THING IS WHAT THE LAW

03:33:03.470 --> 03:33:05.539
SAYS IS AS AN AGENT OR ATTORNEY.

03:33:05.606 --> 03:33:07.674
SO ACCREDITATION IS ABOUT BEING

03:33:07.741 --> 03:33:09.743
ACCREDITED AS AN AGENT AND AN

03:33:09.810 --> 03:33:11.345
AGENT, THE DEFINING

03:33:11.411 --> 03:33:12.312
CHARACTERISTIC OF BEING AN

03:33:12.379 --> 03:33:13.614
AGENT. AND THIS WAS STATED BY

03:33:13.680 --> 03:33:15.449
THE VA IN 2006 WHEN THEY

03:33:15.516 --> 03:33:17.818
PUBLISHED THEIR RULE ON THE LAW,

03:33:17.885 --> 03:33:18.485
THAT THE DEFINING CHARACTERISTIC

03:33:18.552 --> 03:33:19.853
OF BEING AN AGENT IS COMPLETING

03:33:19.920 --> 03:33:21.688
THE POWER OF ATTORNEY FORM AND

03:33:21.755 --> 03:33:23.991
BECOMING THE VA THE VETERANS

03:33:24.057 --> 03:33:25.025
REPRESENTATIVE TO THE VA. THEY

03:33:25.092 --> 03:33:26.493
ARE SUBMITTING THE CLAIM ON

03:33:26.560 --> 03:33:28.162
BEHALF OF THE VETERAN THEY'RE

03:33:28.228 --> 03:33:29.229
PROSECUTING. THEY HAVE ACCESS

03:33:29.296 --> 03:33:31.632
INTO VBMS, INTO CAPRI. THEY HAVE

03:33:31.698 --> 03:33:34.968
THE ABILITY TO TALK WITH THE

03:33:35.035 --> 03:33:36.603
RAIDERS AGENCY HAS A VERY

03:33:36.670 --> 03:33:38.672
DEFINITIVE MEANING. WE ARE NOT

03:33:38.739 --> 03:33:40.807
ACTING AS AGENTS. WE ARE ACTING

03:33:40.874 --> 03:33:42.309
AS CONSULTANTS. THE VETERAN IS

03:33:42.376 --> 03:33:43.377
SUBMITTING THE CLAIM ON THEIR

03:33:43.443 --> 03:33:44.711
OWN NAME ON THEIR OWN BEHALF.

03:33:44.778 --> 03:33:46.413
THEY'RE PROSECUTING IT WITH US

03:33:46.480 --> 03:33:48.081
AS CONSULTANTS, ASSISTING THEM.

03:33:48.148 --> 03:33:49.816
AND WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS EVERY

03:33:49.883 --> 03:33:51.652
VETERAN'S RIGHT TO MAKE THAT

03:33:51.718 --> 03:33:53.287
CHOICE, NOT ONLY UNDER CURRENT

03:33:53.353 --> 03:33:55.622
VA LAW, BUT ALSO UNDER THE

03:33:55.689 --> 03:33:56.190
CONSTITUTION AND THEIR FIRST

03:33:56.256 --> 03:33:58.392
AMENDMENT RIGHTS, TO WORK WITH

03:33:58.458 --> 03:34:01.395
ANYONE, TO EXCHANGE INFORMATION,

03:34:01.461 --> 03:34:02.629
TO PREPARE TO PETITION THEIR

03:34:02.696 --> 03:34:04.565
GOVERNMENT FOR A GRIEVANCE.

03:34:04.631 --> 03:34:07.701
THESE, THESE, THESE FINES THAT

03:34:07.768 --> 03:34:10.337
WERE REMOVED IN 2006 TO THEY

03:34:10.404 --> 03:34:12.139
WEREN'T REMOVED FOR OUR

03:34:12.206 --> 03:34:13.907
INDUSTRY. OUR INDUSTRY DID NOT

03:34:13.974 --> 03:34:16.443
EXIST 20 YEARS AGO. THIS EXISTED

03:34:16.510 --> 03:34:18.245
WHAT THE CO-CREATION OF VSOS AND

03:34:18.312 --> 03:34:19.646
THE VA PUTTING TOGETHER WHAT'S

03:34:19.713 --> 03:34:21.481
CALLED A FULLY DEVELOPED CLAIM

03:34:21.548 --> 03:34:23.584
TO HELP WITH THIS PROBLEM OF HOW

03:34:23.650 --> 03:34:26.086
MANY CLAIMS. SO IN 2006, THOSE

03:34:26.153 --> 03:34:28.589
FINES WERE REMOVED TO PROTECT

03:34:28.655 --> 03:34:30.190
VSOS AND FAMILY MEMBERS OR

03:34:30.257 --> 03:34:32.659
FRIENDS FROM HELPING VETERANS

03:34:32.726 --> 03:34:33.527
WITHOUT GETTING CIVIL OR

03:34:33.594 --> 03:34:35.896
CRIMINAL PENALTIES. THESE AT

03:34:35.963 --> 03:34:38.699
THAT TIME, THIS INDUSTRY DID NOT

03:34:38.765 --> 03:34:40.400
EXIST. SO THERE WAS NOTHING.

03:34:40.467 --> 03:34:42.736
THERE WAS NO REASON. AND WE ARE

03:34:42.803 --> 03:34:44.705
NOT THE REASON FOR THOSE FINES

03:34:44.771 --> 03:34:46.707
TO BE REMOVED. I WANTED TO MAKE

03:34:46.773 --> 03:34:48.075
THAT CLEAR AS WELL. OKAY. I

03:34:48.141 --> 03:34:50.544
MEAN, I'M, YOU KNOW, I HAVE

03:34:50.611 --> 03:34:51.845
GREAT RESPECT FOR THE AUTHORS. I

03:34:51.912 --> 03:34:54.915
KNOW THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO, YOU

03:34:54.982 --> 03:34:56.149
KNOW, REALLY PROTECT OUR

03:34:56.216 --> 03:34:57.351
VETERANS. IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S

03:34:57.417 --> 03:34:59.019
SOME BAD ACTORS OUT THERE THAT

03:34:59.086 --> 03:35:01.521
THIS IS AIMED AT, AT ADDRESSING.

03:35:01.588 --> 03:35:03.657
AND SO I'M CLEARLY GOING TO

03:35:03.724 --> 03:35:06.159
SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. I DO

03:35:06.226 --> 03:35:08.862
HOPE, THOUGH, THAT THAT YOU'LL

03:35:08.929 --> 03:35:10.530
WORK WITH THE OPPONENTS AND FIND

03:35:10.597 --> 03:35:16.503
A WAY OF NOT CLOSING DOWN. HELP

03:35:16.570 --> 03:35:19.006
FOR VETERANS AND GIVING VETERANS

03:35:19.072 --> 03:35:20.540
CHOICES FOR FOLKS THAT ACTUALLY

03:35:20.607 --> 03:35:22.376
ARE REGULATED. I DO THINK THAT

03:35:22.442 --> 03:35:23.710
FOLKS SHOULD BE REGULATED

03:35:23.777 --> 03:35:25.012
BECAUSE THERE IS FRAUD THAT'S

03:35:25.078 --> 03:35:26.980
GOING TO OCCUR, ESPECIALLY WHEN

03:35:27.047 --> 03:35:28.115
THERE'S FEES THAT ARE GOING TO

03:35:28.181 --> 03:35:30.250
BE CHARGED. BUT, YOU KNOW, I

03:35:30.317 --> 03:35:31.318
ALSO THINK OF IT IN THE SAME

03:35:31.385 --> 03:35:33.220
WAY, YOU KNOW, I CAN I CAN GO

03:35:33.287 --> 03:35:34.688
GET A PASSPORT IN THE NORMAL,

03:35:34.755 --> 03:35:36.390
FOLLOW THE NORMAL PROCESS. AT

03:35:36.456 --> 03:35:37.758
ONE POINT, BASICALLY, I ENDED UP

03:35:37.824 --> 03:35:39.192
GOING TO AN OUTSIDE AGENT TO

03:35:39.259 --> 03:35:41.628
SORT OF HELP ME GET THE PASSPORT

03:35:41.695 --> 03:35:42.329
THAT THEY WENT DOWN TO THE

03:35:42.396 --> 03:35:44.264
FEDERAL BUILDING. I HAD TO PAY A

03:35:44.331 --> 03:35:45.799
FEE FOR IT. BUT LIKE, I'M REALLY

03:35:45.866 --> 03:35:48.101
GLAD THAT I HAD THAT SERVICE

03:35:48.168 --> 03:35:48.702
BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE HAD TO

03:35:48.769 --> 03:35:50.304
CANCEL A REALLY IMPORTANT TRIP

03:35:50.370 --> 03:35:52.839
WITH A FAMILY IF I HAD NOT HAD

03:35:52.906 --> 03:35:54.441
THAT. SO I THINK THAT CONTINUING

03:35:54.508 --> 03:35:55.375
TO GIVE VETERANS OPTIONS IS A

03:35:55.442 --> 03:35:56.810
GOOD THING, AS LONG AS THE

03:35:56.877 --> 03:35:58.312
OPTIONS ARE REGULATED. AND IT

03:35:58.378 --> 03:36:00.480
DOESN'T SOUND TO ME LIKE THE

03:36:00.547 --> 03:36:01.815
ANSWER SAYS JUST GET ACCREDITED

03:36:01.882 --> 03:36:03.583
IS THE ANSWER. BECAUSE IF THEY

03:36:03.650 --> 03:36:04.818
CAN'T GET ACCREDITED, THEN

03:36:04.885 --> 03:36:06.153
YOU'RE BASICALLY SHUTTING, CAN

03:36:06.219 --> 03:36:08.188
THEY JUST CAN'T CHARGE YOU?

03:36:08.255 --> 03:36:09.756
WELL, BUT THAT'S THAT'S THEY

03:36:09.823 --> 03:36:11.124
CAN. BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.

03:36:11.191 --> 03:36:12.759
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. NO ONE'S

03:36:12.826 --> 03:36:14.261
GOING TO NO ONE'S GOING TO. NO

03:36:14.328 --> 03:36:15.729
ONE'S GOING TO PROVIDE SERVICES

03:36:15.796 --> 03:36:16.897
AND SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES.

03:36:16.963 --> 03:36:18.532
YEAH. SO THE REASON WHY THE VA

03:36:18.598 --> 03:36:19.533
AND THE REASON WHY THIS RULE

03:36:19.599 --> 03:36:20.967
EXISTS TO NOT CHARGE UNDER

03:36:21.034 --> 03:36:22.069
VETERANS INITIAL CLAIM, BECAUSE

03:36:22.135 --> 03:36:25.639
THAT IS USUALLY THE EASIEST TIME

03:36:25.706 --> 03:36:27.474
FOR VETERANS TO GET SERVICE

03:36:27.541 --> 03:36:28.709
CONNECTED. AND THERE YOU HAVE

03:36:28.775 --> 03:36:29.976
PRESUMPTIVE CONDITIONS. YOU

03:36:30.043 --> 03:36:32.079
MIGHT HAVE A VETERAN WHO GOT HIS

03:36:32.145 --> 03:36:34.047
PURPLE HEART, SOME COMBAT MEDALS

03:36:34.114 --> 03:36:36.416
OF VALOR NEVER FILED THEIR CLAIM

03:36:36.483 --> 03:36:38.251
FOR PTSD, DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE

03:36:38.318 --> 03:36:39.186
SITUATION, DOESN'T UNDERSTAND

03:36:39.252 --> 03:36:41.421
THE CLAIMS PROCESS. RIGHT. SO

03:36:41.488 --> 03:36:43.156
THE REASON WHY YOU CAN'T CHARGE

03:36:43.223 --> 03:36:44.391
FOR THOSE INITIAL CLAIMS?

03:36:44.458 --> 03:36:45.559
BECAUSE THAT IS USUALLY THE

03:36:45.625 --> 03:36:46.927
EASIEST TIME FOR A VETERAN AND

03:36:46.993 --> 03:36:49.396
HAS THE HIGHEST RETURN ON THESE

03:36:49.463 --> 03:36:51.365
COMPANIES INVESTMENTS. THAT'S

03:36:51.431 --> 03:36:53.367
THE REASON WHY THEY DO NOT WANT

03:36:53.433 --> 03:36:54.701
TO GET ACCREDITED, BECAUSE THE

03:36:54.768 --> 03:36:57.671
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 50 AND 70% IS

03:36:57.738 --> 03:37:00.207
VERY LITTLE, BUT A DIFFERENCE

03:37:00.273 --> 03:37:01.775
BETWEEN 0 AND 70% IS THOUSANDS

03:37:01.842 --> 03:37:03.343
OF DOLLARS, WHICH THEN ALLOWS

03:37:03.410 --> 03:37:04.845
THEM TO SPEND MILLIONS OF

03:37:04.911 --> 03:37:07.848
DOLLARS ON MARKETING AND

03:37:07.914 --> 03:37:10.717
LOBBYING. TO GET THIS ISSUE

03:37:10.784 --> 03:37:12.219
ADDRESSED, I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT

03:37:12.285 --> 03:37:13.687
ONE THING. I DO MANY THINGS. I

03:37:13.754 --> 03:37:16.189
DO MANY THINGS IN MY LIFE. I'M A

03:37:16.256 --> 03:37:17.424
VETERAN SERVICES OFFICER. I'M

03:37:17.491 --> 03:37:19.226
ALSO A DAD, AND ONE OF THE

03:37:19.292 --> 03:37:21.695
THINGS I HAVE TO DO EVERY YEAR

03:37:21.762 --> 03:37:23.330
IS A DAD FOR MY COACH. MY GIRLS

03:37:23.397 --> 03:37:24.297
BASKETBALL IS I HAVE TO TAKE MY

03:37:24.364 --> 03:37:26.733
ONLINE SAFE TRAINING. I HAVE TO

03:37:26.800 --> 03:37:28.101
GET A CERTIFICATE TO LET THEM

03:37:28.168 --> 03:37:29.403
KNOW THAT I AM A SAFE PERSON TO

03:37:29.469 --> 03:37:31.138
WORK WITH. AND I'VE BEEN THROUGH

03:37:31.204 --> 03:37:33.340
A CLASS AND PARENTS CAN TRUST MY

03:37:33.407 --> 03:37:34.808
KIDS. ALL WE'RE ASKING IS THAT

03:37:34.875 --> 03:37:37.644
THESE COMPANIES GO OUT AND GET

03:37:37.711 --> 03:37:39.446
ACCREDITED OR AND IT'S NOT ON

03:37:39.513 --> 03:37:41.882
THE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYER FOR US

03:37:41.948 --> 03:37:43.550
TO PREVENT ACCREDITATION POLICY

03:37:43.617 --> 03:37:45.585
OR OVERSIGHT OR FOR THEM TO

03:37:45.652 --> 03:37:48.088
CONTINUE TO DO THEIR WORK AND,

03:37:48.155 --> 03:37:50.157
AND GET LEGALIZED SO THEREFORE

03:37:50.223 --> 03:37:51.958
THEY CAN OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA.

03:37:52.025 --> 03:37:53.827
I DO NOT KNOW OF ANY OTHER

03:37:53.894 --> 03:37:55.695
INDUSTRY WHERE THEY ALLOW PEOPLE

03:37:55.762 --> 03:37:56.997
TO OPERATE THAT ARE CURRENTLY

03:37:57.063 --> 03:37:58.832
NOT LICENSED OR ACCREDITED IN

03:37:58.899 --> 03:38:01.368
ANY FASHION TO CHARGE FOR THEIR

03:38:01.435 --> 03:38:02.736
SERVICES. IT'S ALREADY AGAINST

03:38:02.803 --> 03:38:04.404
CALIFORNIA LAW. OKAY. THANK YOU.

03:38:04.471 --> 03:38:06.440
I DIDN'T ASK YOUR QUESTION, BUT

03:38:06.506 --> 03:38:08.241
I CAME IN IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS.

03:38:08.308 --> 03:38:10.210
SO I'M TRYING TO SORT OUT WHO'S

03:38:10.277 --> 03:38:11.578
ON FIRST. YES. SO LET ME JUST

03:38:11.645 --> 03:38:14.347
I'M JUST GOING TO FINISH I, I

03:38:14.414 --> 03:38:15.348
AGREE THAT ACTUALLY ANYONE WHO'S

03:38:15.415 --> 03:38:16.783
PROVIDING A SERVICE TO VETERAN

03:38:16.850 --> 03:38:18.318
NEEDS TO HAVE OVERSIGHT AND

03:38:18.385 --> 03:38:21.955
THERE SHOULD BE SOME REGULATORY

03:38:22.022 --> 03:38:23.890
PROGRAM THERE. THERE SEEMS TO BE

03:38:23.957 --> 03:38:24.691
A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION OF

03:38:24.758 --> 03:38:26.326
WHETHER OR NOT THESE GUYS CAN

03:38:26.393 --> 03:38:28.628
GET ACCREDITED. I WOULD JUST

03:38:28.695 --> 03:38:30.530
LIKE TO NOT IN THE I'M GOING TO

03:38:30.597 --> 03:38:32.299
VOTE FOR THIS TODAY. OBVIOUSLY I

03:38:32.365 --> 03:38:34.334
THINK THAT THE THAT THE THAT THE

03:38:34.401 --> 03:38:35.535
THRUST OF THE BILL IS ACTUALLY

03:38:35.602 --> 03:38:36.736
VERY, VERY IMPORTANT AND SO

03:38:36.803 --> 03:38:38.205
VOTING FOR THAT PURPOSE. BUT I'D

03:38:38.271 --> 03:38:40.106
ALSO LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:38:40.173 --> 03:38:42.309
WE'RE NOT SORT OF CLOSING DOWN

03:38:42.375 --> 03:38:45.011
OPTIONS FOR VETERANS, BECAUSE I

03:38:45.078 --> 03:38:46.480
KNOW WHAT MY DAD WENT THROUGH

03:38:46.546 --> 03:38:47.380
SOMETIMES HE'D GO TO THE VA AND

03:38:47.447 --> 03:38:49.382
HE COULDN'T GET A RESPONSE. AND

03:38:49.449 --> 03:38:51.351
THEN WE'D GO TO THE APPEAL. AND,

03:38:51.418 --> 03:38:53.286
YOU KNOW, WE WERE SITTING THERE.

03:38:53.353 --> 03:38:54.421
IT'S LIKE SOMETIMES PEOPLE NEED

03:38:54.488 --> 03:38:55.889
HELP, AND THE HELP THAT THEY'RE

03:38:55.956 --> 03:38:57.357
GETTING IS NOT, YOU KNOW, WE

03:38:57.424 --> 03:38:58.925
HAVE ALL KINDS OF NAVIGATORS AND

03:38:58.992 --> 03:39:00.126
ALL KINDS OF GOVERNMENT

03:39:00.193 --> 03:39:01.828
PROGRAMS. AND THOSE NAVIGATORS,

03:39:01.895 --> 03:39:03.396
95% OF THE TIME, THEY WORK WELL,

03:39:03.463 --> 03:39:05.098
BUT THEY DON'T ALWAYS WORK WELL.

03:39:05.165 --> 03:39:07.367
SO I JUST HATE SHUTTING DOWN

03:39:07.434 --> 03:39:09.536
AVENUES FOR RELIEF IF WE DON'T

03:39:09.603 --> 03:39:11.404
HAVE TO. BUT I DO BELIEVE THEY

03:39:11.471 --> 03:39:12.772
NEED TO BE REGULATED. SO I'D

03:39:12.839 --> 03:39:14.140
HOPE YOU'D WORK ON SOMETHING

03:39:14.207 --> 03:39:15.942
LIKE THAT. YEAH. AND IF I MAY,

03:39:16.009 --> 03:39:19.946
MADAM CHAIR, WE'RE NOT TRYING TO

03:39:20.013 --> 03:39:22.148
PREVENT THEM. WE'RE TRYING TO

03:39:22.215 --> 03:39:24.251
ENCOURAGE THEM TO GO AHEAD AND

03:39:24.317 --> 03:39:25.785
GET INTO THE PROCESS. AND ONCE

03:39:25.852 --> 03:39:27.454
THEY GET IN THE PROCESS, THEY

03:39:27.521 --> 03:39:28.555
COME BACK, GOD WILLING, A YEAR

03:39:28.622 --> 03:39:31.091
OR TWO FROM NOW, THEN I WILL

03:39:31.157 --> 03:39:33.226
LEAD THE CHARGE, AND I WILL DO

03:39:33.293 --> 03:39:35.061
THAT TO HELP THEM TO OPEN THE

03:39:35.128 --> 03:39:37.230
DOORS. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS WE

03:39:37.297 --> 03:39:38.965
JUST HEARD THAT JUST CAME TO ME,

03:39:39.032 --> 03:39:40.834
WE HAVE VETERANS THAT ARE

03:39:40.901 --> 03:39:43.970
GETTING 15 AND 20% DISABILITY

03:39:44.037 --> 03:39:46.139
CLAIM, RIGHT? AND THE TIME AND

03:39:46.206 --> 03:39:48.108
EFFORT IT TAKES TO DO THAT,

03:39:48.174 --> 03:39:49.442
THEY'LL DO IT. BUT WAIT A

03:39:49.509 --> 03:39:50.810
MINUTE. I GOT THIS GUY HERE

03:39:50.877 --> 03:39:52.779
WHO'S WHO RECEIVES A PURPLE

03:39:52.846 --> 03:39:54.080
HEART AND CAN HARDLY WALK. AND

03:39:54.147 --> 03:39:55.515
HE'S BRAIN DAMAGED AND

03:39:55.582 --> 03:39:56.316
EVERYTHING ELSE. WELL, I DON'T

03:39:56.383 --> 03:39:58.618
WANT TO SPEND ANY TIME ON THIS

03:39:58.685 --> 03:40:00.320
GUY. I'M GOING TO SPEND ALL MY

03:40:00.387 --> 03:40:02.122
TIME ON THIS GUY BECAUSE THIS IS

03:40:02.188 --> 03:40:03.857
THE BIG BUCKS. THIS IS THE BIG

03:40:03.924 --> 03:40:05.525
BUCKS. NOW, I'M BEING FACETIOUS,

03:40:05.592 --> 03:40:07.861
BUT IN REALITY, THEY HAVE TO

03:40:07.928 --> 03:40:10.096
ADHERE TO EVERY SINGLE VETERAN,

03:40:10.163 --> 03:40:12.165
NO MATTER WHAT IT IS. HOW DO I

03:40:12.232 --> 03:40:13.833
GET MY KID INTO COLLEGE? I'M A

03:40:13.900 --> 03:40:15.402
COMBAT VETERAN. HOW DO I GO

03:40:15.468 --> 03:40:17.904
AHEAD AND PAY MY RENT, GET ME

03:40:17.971 --> 03:40:19.306
INTO THE SERVICES? SO IT'S A

03:40:19.372 --> 03:40:22.909
FULL SERVICE ORGANIZATION, OUR

03:40:22.976 --> 03:40:24.578
VFW, AMERICAN LEGION, AMVETS,

03:40:24.644 --> 03:40:26.446
ALL OF THEM THAT ALL OF YOU

03:40:26.513 --> 03:40:27.981
REPRESENT IN YOUR COMMUNITIES.

03:40:28.048 --> 03:40:30.083
SO THIS IS JUST OPENING UP THE

03:40:30.150 --> 03:40:32.285
DOOR THAT GOD ALMIGHTY, WE'VE

03:40:32.352 --> 03:40:33.687
GOT AN ISSUE HERE AND WE'RE

03:40:33.753 --> 03:40:35.121
GOING TO ADDRESS IT. WE'RE

ADDRESSING IT HERE IN

03:40:36.256 --> 03:40:37.657
CALIFORNIA, AND WE SHOULD TAKE

03:40:37.724 --> 03:40:39.593
THE LEAD. AND IF WE CAN HELP

03:40:39.659 --> 03:40:40.627
THESE INDIVIDUALS, GOOD PEOPLE,

03:40:40.694 --> 03:40:42.395
GET ACCREDITED, THEN LET'S DO

03:40:42.462 --> 03:40:43.897
IT. BUT LET'S KEEP THE BAD

03:40:43.964 --> 03:40:45.732
APPLES OUT. AND THAT'S MY

03:40:45.799 --> 03:40:47.701
CLOSING. AND WITH THAT, I HAVE

03:40:47.767 --> 03:40:48.768
ONE OVER HERE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

03:40:48.835 --> 03:40:51.104
PACHECO, PLEASE, REAL QUICK. SO

I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU,

PUSHING FOR LEGISLATION TO

DOING EVERYTHING THAT YOU CAN

03:41:03.617 --> 03:41:05.885
FOR OUR VETERANS AND TO ALL OF

03:41:05.952 --> 03:41:06.886
OUR VETERANS. I WANT TO SAY

03:41:06.953 --> 03:41:08.388
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK

IMPORTANT FOR YOUR VOICE TO BE

HEARD, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES

03:41:14.427 --> 03:41:15.862
TO LEGISLATION THAT MAY IMPACT

03:41:15.929 --> 03:41:18.365
YOU. AND I THINK WE CAN ALL

03:41:18.431 --> 03:41:20.200
AGREE. I KNOW IT'S SAID BEFORE,

03:41:20.266 --> 03:41:23.003
WE ALL CARE ABOUT VETERANS,

03:41:23.069 --> 03:41:24.371
OPPOSITION CARES ABOUT VETERANS,

03:41:24.437 --> 03:41:26.640

03:41:26.706 --> 03:41:28.742
THAT EVERYTHING IS DONE TO HELP

03:41:28.808 --> 03:41:31.978
THEM TO NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM. AND

03:41:32.045 --> 03:41:34.247
SO I WANT TO COMMEND YOU FOR

03:41:34.314 --> 03:41:36.282
BEING HERE AS WELL. THANK YOU

03:41:36.349 --> 03:41:37.751
FOR YOUR SERVICE FOR THOSE THAT

03:41:37.817 --> 03:41:40.353
HAVE SERVED. BUT IT SEEMS LIKE

03:41:40.420 --> 03:41:42.489
THERE'S A PATHWAY FORWARD.

03:41:42.555 --> 03:41:43.823
OPPOSITION WANTS TO BE

03:41:43.890 --> 03:41:47.093
REGULATED. AND SO I WANT TO HEAR

03:41:47.160 --> 03:41:51.898
FROM YOU AS TO THIS BILL AND HOW

03:41:51.965 --> 03:41:53.566
WE CAN MOVE FORWARD. I KNOW YOU

03:41:53.633 --> 03:41:55.502
WANT TO BE REGULATED, AND I

03:41:55.568 --> 03:41:57.237
WOULD JUST LOVE TO HEAR FROM

03:41:57.303 --> 03:41:58.238
YOU. IF THERE'S CERTAIN

03:41:58.304 --> 03:41:59.806
AMENDMENTS THAT CAN BE TAKEN TO

03:41:59.873 --> 03:42:02.275
MAKE THIS BILL BETTER. SO YOURS

03:42:02.342 --> 03:42:04.411
IS ARE YOU ASKING FOR THAT? YES.

03:42:04.477 --> 03:42:06.246
OKAY. SO HERE ARE THE REAL

03:42:06.312 --> 03:42:06.980
PROTECTIONS THAT WE COULD AGREE

03:42:07.047 --> 03:42:08.915
TO AND HAVE AGREED TO. VETERANS

03:42:08.982 --> 03:42:10.150
SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO PRICING

03:42:10.216 --> 03:42:10.784
TRANSPARENCY. A DESCRIPTION OF

03:42:10.850 --> 03:42:11.985
THE SERVICES, INCLUDING THE

03:42:12.052 --> 03:42:13.453
AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION THAT WILL

03:42:13.520 --> 03:42:15.422
BE DETERMINED AND WHAT THEY

03:42:15.488 --> 03:42:16.489
WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR. THEY

03:42:16.556 --> 03:42:18.458
SHOULD BE MADE AWARE THAT A FREE

03:42:18.525 --> 03:42:20.093
SERVICE EXISTS, AND THEY SHOULD

03:42:20.160 --> 03:42:21.528
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IN WRITING,

03:42:21.594 --> 03:42:22.429
FEES SHOULD BE CONTINGENT ONLY

03:42:22.495 --> 03:42:23.263
ON AN INCREASE. SO THEREFORE, IT

03:42:23.329 --> 03:42:24.764
DOESN'T MATTER HOW HARD WE WORK

03:42:24.831 --> 03:42:26.666
ON A CLAIM, IF THEY DO NOT SEE

03:42:26.733 --> 03:42:29.202
AN INCREASE, WE DO NOT GET PAID.

03:42:29.269 --> 03:42:30.737
THERE SHOULD BE A PROHIBITION ON

03:42:30.804 --> 03:42:31.271
GUARANTEEING A SUCCESSFUL

03:42:31.337 --> 03:42:31.971
OUTCOME, BECAUSE YOU CANNOT

03:42:32.038 --> 03:42:33.306
PREDICT WHAT THE OUTCOME WOULD

03:42:33.373 --> 03:42:35.809
BE. WE ALSO FINALLY AGREED THAT

03:42:35.875 --> 03:42:38.044
A PERSON SHALL NOT MAKE A FALSE

03:42:38.111 --> 03:42:38.978
REPRESENTATION, THAT THEY ARE AN

03:42:39.045 --> 03:42:40.413
ACCREDITED REPRESENTATIVE OF A

03:42:40.480 --> 03:42:42.415
VSO, A CLAIM AGENT OR ATTORNEY.

03:42:42.482 --> 03:42:43.683
SO THOSE ARE THE REAL

03:42:43.750 --> 03:42:45.585
PROTECTIONS WE CAN AGREE TO

03:42:45.652 --> 03:42:47.020
WITHOUT BEING PROHIBITED FROM

03:42:47.087 --> 03:42:47.487
PROVIDING OUR SERVICES

03:42:47.554 --> 03:42:48.788
ALTOGETHER. AND WE CAN TAKE AND

03:42:48.855 --> 03:42:51.291
I HEAR FROM THE IN ADDITION TO

03:42:51.357 --> 03:42:53.426
THOSE, WE WOULD AGREE TO A FEE

03:42:53.493 --> 03:42:54.594
CAP, A REASONABLE FEE CAP, WHICH

03:42:54.661 --> 03:42:56.196
WE HAVE SEEN IN SEVEN OTHER

03:42:56.262 --> 03:42:58.064
STATES THAT HAVE ENACTED SIMILAR

03:42:58.131 --> 03:42:58.932
LEGISLATION AND IS ALSO INCLUDED

03:42:58.998 --> 03:43:00.967
IN THE FEDERAL LEGISLATION. WE

03:43:01.034 --> 03:43:02.702
AGREE ON A MORATORIUM OF US

03:43:02.769 --> 03:43:03.803
ASSISTING VETERANS WITHIN THE

03:43:03.870 --> 03:43:06.339
FIRST 365 DAYS OF THEIR

03:43:06.406 --> 03:43:07.574
SEPARATION, WHICH IS WHEN IT'S

03:43:07.640 --> 03:43:09.242
THE MOST OPPORTUNITY, EASIEST

03:43:09.309 --> 03:43:12.045
FOR A VETERAN TO GET THEIR THEIR

03:43:12.112 --> 03:43:13.279
FEES APPROVED. WE WOULD AGREE

03:43:13.346 --> 03:43:15.682
WITH ADDING A RIGHT OF ACTION SO

03:43:15.749 --> 03:43:17.083
THAT VETERANS WOULD HAVE

03:43:17.150 --> 03:43:18.651
RECOURSE IN THE STATE OF

03:43:18.718 --> 03:43:20.086
CALIFORNIA. I COULD KEEP GOING

03:43:20.153 --> 03:43:22.522
ON AND ON. YOU PICK A CRITICISM

03:43:22.589 --> 03:43:25.759
OF OUR INDUSTRY, AND THERE'S I

03:43:25.825 --> 03:43:27.327
CAN'T THINK OF ANY OF THEM THAT

03:43:27.393 --> 03:43:29.362
ARE OUT THERE RIGHT NOW THAT WE

03:43:29.429 --> 03:43:30.864
WOULDN'T AGREE TO A PROHIBITION

03:43:30.930 --> 03:43:31.931
AGAINST THEM. AND WE HAVE

03:43:31.998 --> 03:43:34.534
PROVIDED THESE RECOMMENDATION,

03:43:34.601 --> 03:43:36.936
RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS

03:43:37.003 --> 03:43:38.037
FREQUENTLY. AND, MADAM CHAIR,

03:43:38.104 --> 03:43:39.606
I'LL GO AHEAD. AND NOW HAND IT

03:43:39.672 --> 03:43:41.674
OVER TO THE SENATOR. WELL, MADAM

03:43:41.741 --> 03:43:42.942
CHAIR, THESE ARE GREAT IDEAS.

03:43:43.009 --> 03:43:44.144
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? WHEN IT'S

03:43:44.210 --> 03:43:46.312
TIME TO GIVE THEM THEIR LICENSE

03:43:46.379 --> 03:43:48.882
AND GET A STATE LICENSE, WE WILL

03:43:48.948 --> 03:43:50.984
IMPLEMENT THAT. BUT UNTIL THEY

03:43:51.050 --> 03:43:53.052
ARE FINISHED THE ACCREDITATION

03:43:53.119 --> 03:43:54.154
PROCESS, BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW

03:43:54.220 --> 03:43:56.189
HOW THAT'S GOING TO TURN OUT,

03:43:56.256 --> 03:43:57.123
BECAUSE IT MAY TURN OUT

03:43:57.190 --> 03:43:58.291
POSITIVE, MAY TURN OUT NEGATIVE.

03:43:58.358 --> 03:44:00.326
THEY STILL HAVE WORK TO DO IN

03:44:00.393 --> 03:44:02.128
DEALING WITH THE VA IN

03:44:02.195 --> 03:44:03.196
WASHINGTON. WHEN THAT COMES

03:44:03.263 --> 03:44:04.664
BACK, THEN WE CAN TAKE ANOTHER

03:44:04.731 --> 03:44:06.432
LOOK AT IT AND WE WILL CONTINUE

03:44:06.499 --> 03:44:08.168
WORKING WITH THAT. BUT RIGHT NOW

03:44:08.234 --> 03:44:11.137
WE'RE UNDER A CONSTRAINT. WE ARE

03:44:11.204 --> 03:44:12.906
UNDER FEDERAL LAW, CALIFORNIA

03:44:12.972 --> 03:44:15.074
STATE LAW THAT SAYS THESE

03:44:15.141 --> 03:44:16.843
INDIVIDUALS CANNOT OPERATE IN

03:44:16.910 --> 03:44:18.678
CALIFORNIA, PRACTICING

03:44:18.745 --> 03:44:19.512
REPRESENTING VETERANS WHEN

03:44:19.579 --> 03:44:21.181
THEY'RE NOT ACCREDITED. AND IT

03:44:21.247 --> 03:44:23.283
GOES BACK TO THE ACCREDITED. AND

03:44:23.349 --> 03:44:25.852
AGAIN, PARALEGALS CAN'T GO TO

03:44:25.919 --> 03:44:27.053
COURT AND REPRESENT A CLIENT.

03:44:27.120 --> 03:44:29.489
YOU KNOW THAT I KNOW THAT. AND

03:44:29.556 --> 03:44:31.324
BUT WILL THEY WILL THEY DO

03:44:31.391 --> 03:44:32.692
EVERYTHING THEY CAN? I'M SURE.

03:44:32.759 --> 03:44:34.294
BUT THERE'S REGULATIONS THAT

03:44:34.360 --> 03:44:35.929
WE'RE TRYING TO ESTABLISH HERE.

03:44:35.995 --> 03:44:37.897
AND THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES,

03:44:37.964 --> 03:44:39.232
THE LARGEST COUNTY IN THE

03:44:39.299 --> 03:44:41.000
COUNTRY, WHO HAS MORE VETERANS

03:44:41.067 --> 03:44:42.635
THAN ANYONE ELSE. WE HAVE ALMOST

03:44:42.702 --> 03:44:44.337
A MILLION VETERANS THERE. THEY

03:44:44.404 --> 03:44:46.406
HAVE THE BEST OF THE BEST. AND

03:44:46.472 --> 03:44:48.575
EVERY COUNTY IN THE STATE OF

03:44:48.641 --> 03:44:50.343
CALIFORNIA HAS THESE

03:44:50.410 --> 03:44:51.544
PROFESSIONALS. WE WANT TO

03:44:51.611 --> 03:44:53.379
RESPECT WHAT THEY DO. WE WANT TO

03:44:53.446 --> 03:44:54.848
ENHANCE WHAT THEY DO, NO DOUBT.

03:44:54.914 --> 03:44:56.216
BUT WE WANT TO FIND THE BAD

03:44:56.282 --> 03:44:57.450
APPLES AND KEEP THEM OUT. WE

03:44:57.517 --> 03:44:59.452
WANT TO ENCOURAGE THOSE THAT ARE

03:44:59.519 --> 03:45:00.720
GOOD, OKAY, BUT LET THEM FINISH

03:45:00.787 --> 03:45:02.422
THEIR PROCESS. IN THE INTERIM,

03:45:02.488 --> 03:45:04.524
WE HAVE TO ADHERE TO LAW. SO I

03:45:04.591 --> 03:45:06.826
JUST HAD A QUESTION. SO IS THERE

03:45:06.893 --> 03:45:08.328
A IT SEEMS LIKE ALL OF US WANT

03:45:08.394 --> 03:45:10.463
TO GET RID OF BAD ACTORS. AND

03:45:10.530 --> 03:45:13.466
IT'S TRUE THAT PARALEGALS CANNOT

03:45:13.533 --> 03:45:15.535
REPRESENT A CLIENT, BUT YOU

03:45:15.602 --> 03:45:17.737
SOMETIMES SEE A SITUATION WHERE

03:45:17.804 --> 03:45:20.506
A CLIENT NEEDS HELP AND THAT

03:45:20.573 --> 03:45:23.476
PARALEGAL MAY CANNOT GO INTO THE

03:45:23.543 --> 03:45:24.944
COURTROOM AND REPRESENT THAT

03:45:25.011 --> 03:45:27.413
CLIENT. BUT A PARALEGAL WILL

03:45:27.480 --> 03:45:29.282
SOMETIMES HELP WITH, LIKE, YOU

03:45:29.349 --> 03:45:31.117
KNOW, FILLING OUT FORMS. AND YET

03:45:31.184 --> 03:45:33.553
THE CLIENT WILL THEN GO INTO THE

03:45:33.620 --> 03:45:35.355
COURTROOM THEMSELVES AND

03:45:35.421 --> 03:45:36.756
REPRESENT THEMSELVES. BUT OF

03:45:36.823 --> 03:45:39.859
COURSE, AN ATTORNEY CANNOT. I

03:45:39.926 --> 03:45:41.160
MEAN, A PARALEGAL CANNOT DO

03:45:41.227 --> 03:45:42.996
THAT. AND IT SEEMS LIKE AND I

03:45:43.062 --> 03:45:44.530
COULD BE WRONG, BUT IT SEEMS

03:45:44.597 --> 03:45:45.632
LIKE THIS IS THE KIND OF

03:45:45.698 --> 03:45:47.267
SERVICES THAT ARE BEING PROVIDED

03:45:47.333 --> 03:45:48.735
WHERE THEY FILL OUT THE

03:45:48.801 --> 03:45:51.070
PAPERWORK, BUT THEY'RE NOT

03:45:51.137 --> 03:45:53.339
REPRESENTING THEM. SO WE HAVE AN

03:45:53.406 --> 03:45:55.174
AVENUE. CORRECT. AND WE HAVE THE

03:45:55.241 --> 03:45:56.676
AVENUE RIGHT BACK HERE. I KNOW

03:45:56.743 --> 03:45:58.211
WE'RE ALL RIGHT. WE'LL GO ROUND

03:45:58.278 --> 03:46:00.079
AND ROUND. I'M TRYING TO WHAT

03:46:00.146 --> 03:46:02.715
I'M TRYING TO SEE IS, IS THERE A

03:46:02.782 --> 03:46:05.652
WAY THAT CONVERSATIONS CAN BE

03:46:05.718 --> 03:46:06.753
HAD WITH OPPOSITION? BECAUSE IT

03:46:06.819 --> 03:46:08.454
SEEMS LIKE THEY WANT TO BE

03:46:08.521 --> 03:46:09.656
REGULATED, THEY WANT TO HELP

03:46:09.722 --> 03:46:11.591
VETERANS. AND I THINK AT THE END

03:46:11.658 --> 03:46:13.159
OF THE DAY, OUR GOAL SHOULD BE

03:46:13.226 --> 03:46:15.995
HELPING VETERANS. AND SO I WANT

03:46:16.062 --> 03:46:18.331
TO SEE IF THERE'S A PATH FORWARD

03:46:18.398 --> 03:46:20.433
TO HAVE THAT OPEN DIALOG, TO

03:46:20.500 --> 03:46:22.902
HEAR THEM OUT AND SOMEHOW WORK

03:46:22.969 --> 03:46:24.437
ON THIS BILL. BECAUSE IF THERE'S

03:46:24.504 --> 03:46:26.572
NO PATH FORWARD, I DON'T THINK I

03:46:26.639 --> 03:46:27.874
CAN SUPPORT IT. OKAY. THERE IS

03:46:27.941 --> 03:46:30.076
THERE IS ALSO THERE'S ALREADY A

03:46:30.143 --> 03:46:31.577
PROCESS GOING FORWARD AT THE

03:46:31.644 --> 03:46:33.413
FEDERAL LEVEL. THERE IS A BILL

03:46:33.479 --> 03:46:35.214
TO DO EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT TO

03:46:35.281 --> 03:46:37.717
DO, BASICALLY. AND SO THAT IS

03:46:37.784 --> 03:46:38.918
MOVING FORWARD. IT'S PROBABLY

03:46:38.985 --> 03:46:40.286
GOING TO PASS, IF I'M BEING

03:46:40.353 --> 03:46:41.688
HONEST ABOUT THE POLITICS OF THE

03:46:41.754 --> 03:46:43.790
SITUATION RIGHT NOW. SO THERE IS

03:46:43.856 --> 03:46:45.258
SOMETHING MOVING FORWARD. AND IF

03:46:45.325 --> 03:46:47.393
THAT'S THE CASE, THEN WE MAY

03:46:47.460 --> 03:46:48.761
NEED TO REEVALUATE THIS AS A

03:46:48.828 --> 03:46:50.563
STATE. BUT CURRENT FEDERAL LAW,

03:46:50.630 --> 03:46:52.799
THEY ARE OPERATING ILLEGALLY.

03:46:52.865 --> 03:46:54.467
THEY ARE UP HERE TESTIFYING

03:46:54.534 --> 03:46:56.970
TODAY AS AN ILLEGAL BUSINESS

03:46:57.036 --> 03:46:58.338
OPERATING, PROUDLY TALKING ABOUT

03:46:58.404 --> 03:47:00.540
THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING IN

03:47:00.606 --> 03:47:01.908
OUR STATE ILLEGALLY. THEY ARE

03:47:01.975 --> 03:47:03.242
OPERATING ILLEGALLY. IF YOU'RE

03:47:03.309 --> 03:47:04.544
TALKING ABOUT A PARALEGAL, THEY

03:47:04.610 --> 03:47:05.979
STILL HAVE TO BE LICENSED.

03:47:06.045 --> 03:47:07.914
THEY'RE STILL ALL KINDS OF

03:47:07.981 --> 03:47:09.983
REQUIREMENTS THAT YOU NEED TO DO

03:47:10.049 --> 03:47:12.185
NOTHING. THEY ARE IN COMPLETELY

03:47:12.251 --> 03:47:15.555
NO MAN'S LAND, NO REQUIREMENTS,

03:47:15.621 --> 03:47:18.992
NO STANDARDS, NO REPORTING,

03:47:19.058 --> 03:47:20.593
NOTHING. NOTHING IS HAPPENING

03:47:20.660 --> 03:47:22.695
RIGHT NOW TO GIVE US ANY

03:47:22.762 --> 03:47:24.464
DAYLIGHT ON WHAT THEY ARE DOING.

03:47:24.530 --> 03:47:28.334
AND SO WE RESPECT THAT THEY ARE

03:47:28.401 --> 03:47:30.169
SETTING UP THEIR OWN STANDARDS

03:47:30.236 --> 03:47:31.704
AND TRYING TO DO GOOD WORK. THEY

03:47:31.771 --> 03:47:33.773
ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THIS

03:47:33.840 --> 03:47:35.942
INDUSTRY. THEY ARE ONE COMPANY

03:47:36.009 --> 03:47:37.443
THAT CONTINUALLY THIS IS THE

03:47:37.510 --> 03:47:38.444
THIRD TIME I'VE SEEN THEM,

03:47:38.511 --> 03:47:40.246
BECAUSE THEY MAY BE THE ONLY

03:47:40.313 --> 03:47:42.215
GOOD COMPANY THAT THEY CAN FIND

03:47:42.281 --> 03:47:44.183
IN THIS INDUSTRY TO COME AND

03:47:44.250 --> 03:47:45.251
TESTIFY, AND THEY'RE AN

03:47:45.318 --> 03:47:47.120
OUT-OF-STATE COMPANY FROM NORTH

03:47:47.186 --> 03:47:48.221
CAROLINA. THE OTHER COMPANIES

03:47:48.287 --> 03:47:49.589
ARE OUT OF STATE COMPANIES.

03:47:49.655 --> 03:47:50.790
THERE'S NONE OF THESE COMPANIES

03:47:50.857 --> 03:47:54.660
ARE BASED IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO

03:47:54.727 --> 03:47:56.462
THE COMPANY IS NOT BASED IN

03:47:56.529 --> 03:47:58.498
CALIFORNIA. YOU ARE A COMPANY. I

03:47:58.564 --> 03:48:00.466
LIVE AND WORK IN CALIFORNIA. I'M

03:48:00.533 --> 03:48:01.634
NOT TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO

03:48:01.701 --> 03:48:02.902
WORK FOR THE COMPANY. I'M

03:48:02.969 --> 03:48:04.070
TALKING ABOUT THE COMPANY.

03:48:04.137 --> 03:48:05.505
VETERAN BENEFITS GUIDE HAS AN

03:48:05.571 --> 03:48:06.539
OFFICE IN SAN DIEGO, HAS AN

03:48:06.606 --> 03:48:08.374
OFFICE, BUT IT IS BASED IN

03:48:08.441 --> 03:48:11.711
FOUNDED IN SAN DIEGO AND BASED

03:48:11.778 --> 03:48:13.813
IN. WE ALSO HAVE AN OFFICE IN

03:48:13.880 --> 03:48:15.248
NEVADA. YES, IN NEVADA FOUNDED

03:48:15.314 --> 03:48:17.383
IN SAN DIEGO. THAT'S WHERE I

03:48:17.450 --> 03:48:19.952
WORK. OKAY, OKAY, OKAY. MY

03:48:20.019 --> 03:48:21.754
MISTAKE. ONE COMPANY IS HERE.

03:48:21.821 --> 03:48:25.224
SO. SO THIS IS THIS THERE'S

03:48:25.291 --> 03:48:27.060
ALREADY A FEDERAL PROCESS GOING

03:48:27.126 --> 03:48:28.594
FORWARD. THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS

03:48:28.661 --> 03:48:30.830
BILL IS. THIS BILL IS NOT THAT

03:48:30.897 --> 03:48:32.498
PROCESS. THIS BILL IS SIMPLY

03:48:32.565 --> 03:48:34.600
SAYING THAT WHAT IS CURRENT

03:48:34.667 --> 03:48:36.135
FEDERAL LAW THAT MAKES THIS

03:48:36.202 --> 03:48:37.837
ILLEGAL? WE ARE GOING TO CLARIFY

03:48:37.904 --> 03:48:39.639
IN STATE LAW AS WELL. AND WE'RE

03:48:39.705 --> 03:48:41.174
DOING THAT A LOT RIGHT NOW BASED

03:48:41.240 --> 03:48:42.275
ON WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE

03:48:42.341 --> 03:48:44.410
FEDERAL LEVEL. WE ARE DOING THAT

03:48:44.477 --> 03:48:46.279
IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT AREAS TO

03:48:46.345 --> 03:48:50.850
PROTECT PEOPLE. AND SO THIS IS

03:48:50.917 --> 03:48:52.285
SIMPLY MAKING SURE THAT IT'S

03:48:52.351 --> 03:48:53.686
CLEAR SO THAT THE ATTORNEY

03:48:53.753 --> 03:48:54.687
GENERAL, WHO RIGHT NOW DOES NOT

03:48:54.754 --> 03:48:56.456
FEEL LIKE OUR CURRENT STATE LAW

03:48:56.522 --> 03:48:58.524
IS CRYSTAL CLEAR ENOUGH TO MAKE

03:48:58.591 --> 03:48:59.158
SURE THAT THEY'RE HOLDING THESE

03:48:59.225 --> 03:49:02.028
COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE. BUT

03:49:02.095 --> 03:49:03.863
ALREADY, YOU KNOW, FOR EXAMPLE,

03:49:03.930 --> 03:49:06.332
IF YOU WERE TO CHARGE TO HELP

03:49:06.399 --> 03:49:08.501
SOMEONE GET MEDI-CAL OR TO HELP

03:49:08.568 --> 03:49:10.636
SOMEONE GET CALFRESH, RIGHT,

03:49:10.703 --> 03:49:13.106
THIS IS THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING

03:49:13.172 --> 03:49:14.874
WITH THESE COMPANIES. THEY ARE

03:49:14.941 --> 03:49:18.144
CHARGING PEOPLE TO HELP THEM GET

03:49:18.211 --> 03:49:20.379
WHAT THEY SHOULD GET FOR FREE

03:49:20.446 --> 03:49:22.215
AND PUBLIC BENEFITS. THAT IS

03:49:22.281 --> 03:49:25.151
WHAT'S HAPPENING. AND SO THIS,

03:49:25.218 --> 03:49:27.520
YOU KNOW, THIS BILL, THERE'S NO

03:49:27.587 --> 03:49:29.155
DAYLIGHT FOR VETERANS

03:49:29.222 --> 03:49:30.456
ORGANIZATIONS, VETERANS

03:49:30.523 --> 03:49:32.592
ORGANIZATIONS, 100% ARE

03:49:32.658 --> 03:49:34.127
SUPPORTING THIS BILL. IT IS A

03:49:34.193 --> 03:49:36.195
NATIONAL PRIORITY TO MOVE THIS

03:49:36.262 --> 03:49:39.132
POLICY FORWARD. MULTIPLE STATES,

03:49:39.198 --> 03:49:41.968
INCLUDING I THINK ARKANSAS, HAVE

03:49:42.034 --> 03:49:45.972
MADE THIS ILLEGAL, 100% ILLEGAL,

03:49:46.038 --> 03:49:48.474
ALABAMA, WHATEVER IT IS FOR, FOR

03:49:48.541 --> 03:49:49.375
STATES THAT HAVE MADE FOR

03:49:49.442 --> 03:49:51.344
STATES, WHICH ARE THE ONES THAT

03:49:51.410 --> 03:49:52.745
PASS LEGISLATION THAT'S

03:49:52.812 --> 03:49:54.614
SUPPORTIVE OF OUR BUSINESS.

03:49:54.680 --> 03:49:55.681
ARKANSAS. NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT

03:49:55.748 --> 03:49:57.116
I'M TALKING ABOUT. I'M TALKING

03:49:57.183 --> 03:49:58.351
ABOUT MAKING IT ILLEGAL. THERE

03:49:58.417 --> 03:50:00.386
ARE ONLY FOUR STATES THAT WE DO

03:50:00.453 --> 03:50:02.155
NOT OPERATE IN RIGHT NOW. WE ARE

03:50:02.221 --> 03:50:03.689
NOT OPERATING IN THE STATE OF

03:50:03.756 --> 03:50:05.458
NEW JERSEY, THE STATE OF MAINE,

03:50:05.525 --> 03:50:06.826
UTAH OR NEW YORK. I'M CURRENTLY

03:50:06.893 --> 03:50:09.629
SUING THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY.

03:50:09.695 --> 03:50:11.664
OKAY. OKAY. SORRY. LET'S WRAP IT

03:50:11.731 --> 03:50:15.101
UP. SO THIS IS THIS IS ILLEGAL

03:50:15.168 --> 03:50:16.969
FEDERALLY. WE ARE MAKING SURE IT

03:50:17.036 --> 03:50:18.337
IS ILLEGAL HERE. STATEWIDE. WE

03:50:18.404 --> 03:50:19.438
ALREADY HAVE CONSUMER

03:50:19.505 --> 03:50:20.473
PROTECTIONS AT THE STATEWIDE

03:50:20.540 --> 03:50:22.008
LEVEL TO MAKE IT ILLEGAL TO

03:50:22.074 --> 03:50:24.076
CHARGE PEOPLE TO ACCESS PUBLIC

03:50:24.143 --> 03:50:25.444
BENEFITS. SO THIS IS JUST

03:50:25.511 --> 03:50:27.380
ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION TO

03:50:27.446 --> 03:50:29.215
ALLOW THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO

03:50:29.282 --> 03:50:30.616
ENFORCE THE LAW THAT CURRENTLY

03:50:30.683 --> 03:50:32.718
EXISTS AND MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE

03:50:32.785 --> 03:50:34.887
WHO ARE MAYBE NOT THESE PEOPLE

03:50:34.954 --> 03:50:35.955
BECAUSE EVERYBODY LIKES THEM,

03:50:36.022 --> 03:50:38.491
BUT OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE PREYING

03:50:38.558 --> 03:50:41.727
ON PEOPLE THAT THEY CANNOT DO

03:50:41.794 --> 03:50:44.197
THAT BECAUSE THERE IS NO WAY, NO

03:50:44.263 --> 03:50:47.867
WAY FOR US TO ACTUALLY SEE WHAT

03:50:47.934 --> 03:50:49.769
THEY ARE DOING, SEE HOW THEY ARE

03:50:49.835 --> 03:50:50.670
REPRESENTING PEOPLE, SEE WHAT

03:50:50.736 --> 03:50:52.205
THEY'RE CHARGING, SEE THE WORK

03:50:52.271 --> 03:50:54.774
THAT THEY'RE DOING. NO, NO

03:50:54.840 --> 03:50:56.275
VISION BEHIND THE CURTAIN RIGHT

03:50:56.342 --> 03:50:59.345
NOW. OKAY. AND THIS IS SO I IT

03:50:59.412 --> 03:51:01.447
SEEMS LIKE THEY WANT TO BE

03:51:01.514 --> 03:51:03.316
REGULATED AND THEY OFFER A

03:51:03.382 --> 03:51:05.218
SERVICE THAT YOU SAID SEEMS LIKE

03:51:05.284 --> 03:51:07.353
THEY'RE GOOD ACTORS. SO THEY

03:51:07.420 --> 03:51:08.754
WANT TO BE REGULATED. THEY WANT

03:51:08.821 --> 03:51:10.756
TO GET RID OF THE BAD ACTORS.

03:51:10.823 --> 03:51:12.425
AND I THINK AT THE END OF THE

03:51:12.491 --> 03:51:14.760
DAY, WE ALL WANT TO GET RID OF

03:51:14.827 --> 03:51:16.329
THE BAD ACTORS. SO I GUESS I'M

03:51:16.395 --> 03:51:18.130
NOT FULLY UNDERSTANDING WHY THEY

03:51:18.197 --> 03:51:18.798
CAN'T GET ACCREDITED. THEY JUST

03:51:18.864 --> 03:51:20.333
CAN'T CHARGE. HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

03:51:20.399 --> 03:51:22.468
IT SEEMS LIKE THEY HAVE AN

03:51:22.535 --> 03:51:23.469
OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. THAT'S

03:51:23.536 --> 03:51:25.171
VERY DIFFERENT FROM AN OPPOSED.

03:51:25.238 --> 03:51:27.106
THAT MEANS THERE IS A PATHWAY

03:51:27.173 --> 03:51:28.407
FORWARD. AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE

03:51:28.474 --> 03:51:30.309
SURE THAT THEY ARE HEARD. AND

03:51:30.376 --> 03:51:32.578
FROM WHAT I'M HEARING THERE,

03:51:32.645 --> 03:51:34.647
THERE IS NO WILLINGNESS TO HAVE

03:51:34.714 --> 03:51:36.182
THEM HEARD. AND I THINK AT THE

03:51:36.249 --> 03:51:38.517
END OF THE DAY, THEY'RE

03:51:38.584 --> 03:51:39.085
VETERANS. THEY'RE VETERANS

03:51:39.151 --> 03:51:40.419
HELPING OTHER VETERANS. AND

03:51:40.486 --> 03:51:42.588
INSTEAD OF ALL BEING DIVIDED, WE

03:51:42.655 --> 03:51:44.390
CAN ALL GET TO THE TABLE. WE CAN

03:51:44.457 --> 03:51:46.459
ALL HAVE A CONVERSATION. WE CAN

03:51:46.525 --> 03:51:48.294
FIGURE IT OUT TO MAKE THIS BILL

03:51:48.361 --> 03:51:50.162
BETTER. BECAUSE AT THE END OF

03:51:50.229 --> 03:51:51.831
THE DAY, WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR

03:51:51.897 --> 03:51:53.366
VETERANS. THEY HAVE SERVED OUR

03:51:53.432 --> 03:51:55.268
COUNTRY, AND NOW WE HAVE TO DO

03:51:55.334 --> 03:51:57.803
EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO

03:51:57.870 --> 03:51:59.639
PROTECT THEM. AND THEY AGREE,

03:51:59.705 --> 03:52:01.307
BUT ALSO TO LIKE PROTECTING

03:52:01.374 --> 03:52:02.475
THEM, HELP THE SERVICES, BUT

03:52:02.541 --> 03:52:03.776
THEY ALSO WANT TO PROTECT THEM

03:52:03.843 --> 03:52:06.212
TOO. SO THAT'S WHERE I GUESS I

03:52:06.279 --> 03:52:07.780
AM A LITTLE CONFUSED. AND IF

03:52:07.847 --> 03:52:09.949
THERE WAS A WILLINGNESS TO HAVE

03:52:10.016 --> 03:52:11.017
CONVERSATIONS, I WOULD

03:52:11.083 --> 03:52:12.485
DEFINITELY SUPPORT IT.

03:52:12.551 --> 03:52:13.586
ASSEMBLYMEMBERS. BUT IT DOESN'T

03:52:13.653 --> 03:52:15.021
SEEM THAT WAY. OKAY, THAT'S MY

03:52:15.087 --> 03:52:16.322
FRUSTRATION. A NGUYEN NGUYEN IS

03:52:16.389 --> 03:52:18.624
WHAT I'VE PROPOSED. THE NGUYEN

03:52:18.691 --> 03:52:20.726
NGUYEN IS THAT WE WILL BACK THEM

03:52:20.793 --> 03:52:22.928
WHEN THEY COME BACK A YEAR OR

03:52:22.995 --> 03:52:24.697
TWO, WHEN THEY COME BACK WITH

03:52:24.764 --> 03:52:26.132
SOME HARD FACTS FROM THE FEDERAL

03:52:26.198 --> 03:52:27.533
GOVERNMENT, FROM THE VA, THAT

03:52:27.600 --> 03:52:30.503
THEY CAN BE LICENSED LEGALLY IN

03:52:30.569 --> 03:52:31.904
CALIFORNIA AND THEY'RE NOT RIGHT

03:52:31.971 --> 03:52:33.773
NOW. THAT'S THE POINT. OUR DOORS

03:52:33.839 --> 03:52:35.141
ARE NOT CLOSED TO VETERANS.

03:52:35.207 --> 03:52:36.542
THEY'RE OPERATING UNDER ALL

03:52:36.609 --> 03:52:38.177
THESE DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS.

03:52:38.244 --> 03:52:39.745
AND I MENTIONED THEM AGAIN, THE

03:52:39.812 --> 03:52:40.680
COUNTY VETERANS SERVICE OFFICE,

03:52:40.746 --> 03:52:43.115
THE AMERICAN LEGION, AMVETS, RED

03:52:43.182 --> 03:52:44.750
CROSS, YOU NAME THEM, THEY'RE

03:52:44.817 --> 03:52:46.285
ALL THERE. OUR VETERANS ARE

03:52:46.352 --> 03:52:48.487
GETTING SERVICE. THAT'S NOT THE

03:52:48.554 --> 03:52:49.822
POINT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:52:49.889 --> 03:52:50.823
ACCREDITATION. SO IF THERE'S

03:52:50.890 --> 03:52:52.725
GOING TO BE AN AMENDMENT, THE

03:52:52.792 --> 03:52:54.193
AMENDMENT IS THAT, AS I SAID, WE

03:52:54.260 --> 03:52:55.895
WILL OPEN UP THE DOORS TO ALLOW

03:52:55.961 --> 03:52:58.497
THEM TO COME BACK AND SHOW THE

03:52:58.564 --> 03:52:59.699
WORK THEY'VE DONE. THAT WILL

03:52:59.765 --> 03:53:02.835
MAKE IT EASIER FOR THEM TO BE

03:53:02.902 --> 03:53:03.536
LICENSED IN CALIFORNIA, AS I

03:53:03.602 --> 03:53:06.505
MENTIONED, THAT THAT THAT

03:53:06.572 --> 03:53:08.274
EXAMPLE ABOUT DRIVING THE THAT

03:53:08.341 --> 03:53:10.409
BIG 18 WHEELER WITH A COMMERCIAL

03:53:10.476 --> 03:53:12.178
LICENSE VERSUS ANOTHER ONE, WHEN

03:53:12.244 --> 03:53:13.679
YOU COME BACK AND YOU CAN GET

03:53:13.746 --> 03:53:15.815
LICENSED IN CALIFORNIA, WE'LL

03:53:15.881 --> 03:53:17.483
BACK YOU. I MEAN, WE WILL HELP

03:53:17.550 --> 03:53:20.386
THEM. SO YES, LET'S GO AHEAD AND

03:53:20.453 --> 03:53:21.654
DO THAT. BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE

03:53:21.721 --> 03:53:23.689
DEALING WITH THE FACTS TODAY.

03:53:23.756 --> 03:53:26.025
AND THE FACTS ARE WE ARE HERE TO

03:53:26.092 --> 03:53:28.160
HELP VETERANS. WE'VE SEEN IT.

03:53:28.227 --> 03:53:30.129
WE'VE GOT THE SUPPORT FROM EVERY

03:53:30.196 --> 03:53:31.664
VETERANS ORGANIZATION THAT I CAN

03:53:31.731 --> 03:53:33.599
THINK OF. AND THEY ALL SUPPORT

03:53:33.666 --> 03:53:35.668
THIS BILL. AND WITH THAT, I DO

03:53:35.735 --> 03:53:37.703
ASK RESPECTFULLY FOR AN AYE,

03:53:37.770 --> 03:53:41.340
OKAY, LET'S CALL THE VOTE.

03:53:41.407 --> 03:53:43.576
MOTION IS DUE. PASS TO

NUMBER FIVE SB 1313 CERVANTES.

AND JUST WE'LL TAKE 30S FOR THE

03:54:51.043 --> 03:54:52.278
NOISE TO DIE DOWN AND THEN YOU

03:54:52.344 --> 03:54:55.948

CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I

03:55:05.758 --> 03:55:07.993
WILL KEEP THIS SHORT. SB 313 IS

03:55:08.060 --> 03:55:09.628
A VITAL STEP TOWARD PROTECTING

03:55:09.695 --> 03:55:11.330
THE PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF

03:55:11.397 --> 03:55:13.532
CALIFORNIA FAMILIES. IT MAKES A

03:55:13.599 --> 03:55:14.500
STRAIGHTFORWARD BUT IMPORTANT

03:55:14.567 --> 03:55:16.302
CHANGE. IT MOVES THE BIRTHPLACE

03:55:16.368 --> 03:55:17.803
OF A CHILD'S PARENT FROM THE

03:55:17.870 --> 03:55:19.371
PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE PORTION OF A

BELIEVE YOU'RE ALSO PRESENTING

03:57:57.363 --> 03:57:59.398
ON BEHALF OF SENATOR LIMÓN. ITEM

03:57:59.465 --> 03:58:02.568
SEVEN SB 642. YES. THANK YOU,

03:58:02.635 --> 03:58:03.902
MR. CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS,

03:58:03.969 --> 03:58:05.838
THIS YEAR MARKS THE 10TH

03:58:05.904 --> 03:58:06.939
ANNIVERSARY OF THE PASSAGE OF

03:58:07.006 --> 03:58:09.908
THE CALIFORNIA FAIR PAY ACT, A

03:58:09.975 --> 03:58:12.111
HISTORIC BIPARTISAN MEASURE TO

03:58:12.177 --> 03:58:14.546
ADDRESS GAPS IN THE EQUAL PAY

03:58:14.613 --> 03:58:15.948
ACT. OVER THE LAST DECADE, WE

03:58:16.015 --> 03:58:17.716
HAVE SEEN THE GENDER PAY GAP

03:58:17.783 --> 03:58:19.918
CONTINUE TO PERSIST FOR WOMEN,

03:58:19.985 --> 03:58:21.920
WITH WOMEN OF COLOR EXPERIENCING

03:58:21.987 --> 03:58:25.257
THE LARGEST GAPS. SB 642 MAKES

03:58:25.324 --> 03:58:26.692
REFORMS TO THE CALIFORNIA EQUAL

03:58:26.759 --> 03:58:29.194
PAY ACT TO ENSURE WORKERS CAN

03:58:29.261 --> 03:58:30.729
EFFECTIVELY ENFORCE THEIR RIGHTS

03:58:30.796 --> 03:58:33.532
BY HARMONIZING THE STATUTE OF

03:58:33.599 --> 03:58:35.134
LIMITATIONS WITH OTHER WAGE

03:58:35.200 --> 03:58:37.236
STATUTES AND ALLOWING WORKERS TO

03:58:37.302 --> 03:58:40.139
RECOVER FOR ALL LOST PAY FOR UP

03:58:40.205 --> 03:58:41.740
TO TEN YEARS. THE BILL UPDATES

03:58:41.807 --> 03:58:44.243
THE CALIFORNIA EQUAL PAY ACT BY

03:58:44.309 --> 03:58:46.612
REVISING OUTDATED GENDER BINARY

03:58:46.679 --> 03:58:48.380
LANGUAGE AND CLARIFYING THE

03:58:48.447 --> 03:58:50.516
DEFINITION OF WAGES. THIS WOULD

03:58:50.582 --> 03:58:52.317
MAKE THE STATE THE STATE LAW

03:58:52.384 --> 03:58:53.652
CONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL LAW,

03:58:53.719 --> 03:58:55.954
WHICH DEFINES WAGES BROADLY TO

03:58:56.021 --> 03:58:57.990
INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, STOCK,

03:58:58.057 --> 03:59:00.426
STOCK OPTIONS, PROFIT SHARING,

03:59:00.492 --> 03:59:04.163
AND BONUS PLANS. THIS BILL ALSO

03:59:04.229 --> 03:59:06.031
REVISES THE DEFINITION OF PAY

03:59:06.098 --> 03:59:08.067
SCALE TO MEAN A GOOD FAITH

03:59:08.133 --> 03:59:10.669
ESTIMATE OF THE EXPECTED WAGE

03:59:10.736 --> 03:59:12.871
RANGE. IN 2022, THE LEGISLATURE

03:59:12.938 --> 03:59:15.574
PASSED SB 1162, WHICH REQUIRED

03:59:15.641 --> 03:59:17.042
COMPANIES WITH 15 OR MORE

03:59:17.109 --> 03:59:19.311
EMPLOYEES TO INCLUDE A PAY SCALE

03:59:19.378 --> 03:59:21.380
FOR ALL JOB POSTINGS. THE

03:59:21.447 --> 03:59:23.015
LEGISLATION DID NOT PROVIDE ANY

03:59:23.082 --> 03:59:24.616
LIMITS ON THE RANGE OF THE PAY

03:59:24.683 --> 03:59:26.852
SCALE. THIS HAS LED TO SOME

03:59:26.919 --> 03:59:28.687
EMPLOYERS POSTING EXTREMELY

03:59:28.754 --> 03:59:31.423
BROAD PAY RANGES. FOR EXAMPLE,

03:59:31.490 --> 03:59:33.258
ONE JOB POSTING GAVE A SALARY

03:59:33.325 --> 03:59:38.030
RANGE FROM 90,000 TO 900,000. SB

03:59:38.097 --> 03:59:39.798
642 STRENGTHENS OUR PAY EQUITY

03:59:39.865 --> 03:59:42.634
AND PAY TRANSPARENCY LAWS. I

03:59:42.701 --> 03:59:44.470
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE

03:59:44.536 --> 03:59:46.672
TODAY. WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES WHO

03:59:46.739 --> 03:59:48.240
WILL TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. WE HAVE

03:59:48.307 --> 03:59:50.275
SONIA SMOLLET WITH THE

03:59:50.342 --> 03:59:51.577
CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS

03:59:51.643 --> 03:59:52.945
ASSOCIATION AND JESSICA STENDER

03:59:53.011 --> 03:59:55.247
WITH THE EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES

03:59:55.314 --> 03:59:56.749
TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU

03:59:56.815 --> 03:59:58.350
SO MUCH. AND GIVE ME ONE MOMENT.

03:59:58.417 --> 04:00:00.085
I JUST WANT TO MAKE AN

04:00:00.152 --> 04:00:00.719
ANNOUNCEMENT. AFTER THIS BILL,

04:00:00.786 --> 04:00:03.255
WE WILL RECESS AND RETURN AT 130

04:00:03.322 --> 04:00:04.723
TO ROOM 447. SO IF THERE ARE

04:00:04.790 --> 04:00:06.258
OTHER AUTHORS OUT THERE, JUST

04:00:06.325 --> 04:00:07.626
COME BACK AT 130, PLEASE. TO

04:00:07.693 --> 04:00:09.461
ROOM 447. AFTER WE HEAR THIS

04:00:09.528 --> 04:00:11.196
BILL WILL GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY

04:00:11.263 --> 04:00:12.631
FOR ADD ONS AND SUCH, AND THEN

04:00:12.698 --> 04:00:14.166
WE'LL RECESS. PLEASE CONTINUE.

04:00:14.233 --> 04:00:16.235
GOOD AFTERNOON, MR. CHAIR.

04:00:16.301 --> 04:00:17.269
MEMBERS JESSICA STENDER, ON

04:00:17.336 --> 04:00:18.470
BEHALF OF EQUAL RIGHTS

04:00:18.537 --> 04:00:19.304
ADVOCATES, I JUST WANT TO NOTE

04:00:19.371 --> 04:00:21.306
THAT WE HAVE MADE SO MUCH

04:00:21.373 --> 04:00:23.075
PROGRESS IN THIS STATE ON

04:00:23.142 --> 04:00:24.443
COMBATING UNEQUAL, UNEQUAL PAY

04:00:24.510 --> 04:00:26.645
AND CLOSING THE WAGE GAP, BUT IT

04:00:26.712 --> 04:00:27.679
STILL REMAINS AN ISSUE. AND

04:00:27.746 --> 04:00:29.214
THERE ARE SOME IMPORTANT FIXES

04:00:29.281 --> 04:00:30.983
THAT WE WOULD SEE AS VERY

04:00:31.049 --> 04:00:31.950
NECESSARY TO CONTINUE THIS

04:00:32.017 --> 04:00:33.619
FIGHT. ON AVERAGE, WOMEN OVERALL

04:00:33.685 --> 04:00:35.621
IN CALIFORNIA ARE PAID JUST

04:00:35.687 --> 04:00:37.422
$0.79 PER DOLLAR PAID TO MEN,

04:00:37.489 --> 04:00:39.958
AND THAT TRANSLATES INTO

04:00:40.025 --> 04:00:41.794
$350,000 LESS IN WAGES OVER THE

04:00:41.860 --> 04:00:43.629
COURSE OF A 40 YEAR CAREER. AND

04:00:43.695 --> 04:00:44.863
OF COURSE, THOSE PAY DISPARITIES

04:00:44.930 --> 04:00:46.365
ARE WORSE FOR WOMEN OF COLOR.

04:00:46.431 --> 04:00:47.866
BLACK WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA WILL

04:00:47.933 --> 04:00:50.302
MAKE APPROXIMATELY $1.5 MILLION

04:00:50.369 --> 04:00:51.904
LESS THAN THEIR WHITE MALE

04:00:51.970 --> 04:00:53.238
COUNTERPARTS OVER THE COURSE OF

04:00:53.305 --> 04:00:54.540
A 40 YEAR CAREER, AND THESE

04:00:54.606 --> 04:00:56.575
CAREER LOSSES CLIMBED TO $2

04:00:56.642 --> 04:00:58.343
MILLION IN LOST WAGES OVER THE

04:00:58.410 --> 04:00:59.812
COURSE OF A CAREER FOR A LATINO

04:00:59.878 --> 04:01:01.280
WOMAN. SO JUST WANTED TO

04:01:01.346 --> 04:01:02.714
HIGHLIGHT HOW MUCH THIS WAGE GAP

04:01:02.781 --> 04:01:04.016
DEPRIVES NOT ONLY WOMEN WORKERS,

04:01:04.082 --> 04:01:05.884
BUT ALSO THEIR FAMILIES WHO THIS

04:01:05.951 --> 04:01:07.920
MONEY WOULD GO TO SUPPORT WITH

04:01:07.986 --> 04:01:09.454
BASIC NECESSITIES SUCH AS RENT,

04:01:09.521 --> 04:01:10.956
DIAPERS, FOOD, BUT ALSO FOR

04:01:11.023 --> 04:01:12.925
LONGER TERM SAVINGS, RETIREMENT,

04:01:12.991 --> 04:01:15.160
ETC. YOU ALREADY HEARD ABOUT THE

04:01:15.227 --> 04:01:17.196
WAYS IN WHICH THE BILL WILL

04:01:17.262 --> 04:01:18.564
STRENGTHEN THE LAW, AND I JUST

04:01:18.630 --> 04:01:20.299
WANTED TO NOTE THAT THE ENSURING

04:01:20.365 --> 04:01:21.366
ENSURING THAT WAGES ARE

04:01:21.433 --> 04:01:22.801
INCLUDING ALL FORMS OF

04:01:22.868 --> 04:01:24.203
COMPENSATION REALLY DOES CLOSE A

04:01:24.269 --> 04:01:25.537
LOOPHOLE WE HAVE SEEN WHERE AN

04:01:25.604 --> 04:01:27.272
EMPLOYER MAY PAY PEOPLE EQUALLY

04:01:27.339 --> 04:01:29.274
ON A BASE SALARY LEVEL, BUT THEN

04:01:29.341 --> 04:01:30.609
IN TERMS OF EQUITY AND OTHER

04:01:30.676 --> 04:01:32.311
STOCK OPTIONS, ETC, THEY ARE

04:01:32.377 --> 04:01:33.312
PAYING DIFFERENTLY. AND THAT IS

04:01:33.378 --> 04:01:35.013
REALLY OFTEN WHERE WOMEN IN

04:01:35.080 --> 04:01:37.516
HIGHER PAID JOBS ARE UNDERPAID.

04:01:37.583 --> 04:01:39.218
ALSO, JUST IN TERMS OF THE PAY

04:01:39.284 --> 04:01:40.519
TRANSPARENCY PIECE, THE

04:01:40.586 --> 04:01:41.286
LEGISLATURE OF COURSE, ADDRESSED

04:01:41.353 --> 04:01:42.521
THIS AND PASSED THIS IMPORTANT

04:01:42.588 --> 04:01:44.489
LAW. AND WE JUST WANT TO MAKE

04:01:44.556 --> 04:01:46.191
SURE THAT EMPLOYERS HAVE THAT

04:01:46.258 --> 04:01:47.492
GOOD FAITH REQUIREMENT IN ORDER

04:01:47.559 --> 04:01:48.827
TO ENSURE THE LAW HAS ITS

04:01:48.894 --> 04:01:50.128
INTENDED EFFECT. SO WITH ALL

04:01:50.195 --> 04:01:51.864
THESE REASONS, I WOULD LIKE

04:01:51.930 --> 04:01:55.033
REQUEST WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST

04:01:55.100 --> 04:01:55.667
YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK

04:01:55.734 --> 04:01:59.905
YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M SONYA

04:01:59.972 --> 04:02:00.839
SMOLLETTS AND I'M AN ATTORNEY.

04:02:00.906 --> 04:02:02.674
AND I REPRESENT WOMEN WHO'VE

04:02:02.741 --> 04:02:04.843
BEEN SUBJECTED TO DISCRIMINATORY

04:02:04.910 --> 04:02:06.478
PAY PRACTICES. AND I'M A MEMBER

04:02:06.545 --> 04:02:07.746
OF THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT

04:02:07.813 --> 04:02:09.581
LAWYERS ASSOCIATION. AND HERE ON

04:02:09.648 --> 04:02:12.050
THEIR BEHALF, AS AN EQUAL RIGHTS

04:02:12.117 --> 04:02:14.620
ADVOCATES, HELPS CO-SPONSOR THE

04:02:14.686 --> 04:02:16.788
FAIR PAY ACT TEN YEARS AGO. AND

04:02:16.855 --> 04:02:18.156
THAT'S BEEN AN IMPORTANT BILL

04:02:18.223 --> 04:02:20.325
THAT'S HAD SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS.

04:02:20.392 --> 04:02:22.794
BUT AS AS MISS STENDER WAS

04:02:22.861 --> 04:02:24.029
HIGHLIGHTING THESE WAGE, THE

04:02:24.096 --> 04:02:26.098
WAGE GAP CONTINUES TO PERSIST.

04:02:26.164 --> 04:02:28.400
AND THIS BILL HELPS ADDRESS THAT

04:02:28.467 --> 04:02:30.168
WAGE GAP IN A COUPLE OF

04:02:30.235 --> 04:02:33.372
IMPORTANT WAYS. ONE IS IT GIVES

04:02:33.438 --> 04:02:35.440
WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR MORE

04:02:35.507 --> 04:02:37.242
TIME TO BRING THEIR CLAIMS, AND

04:02:37.309 --> 04:02:39.211
IT GIVES THEM ALLOWS THEM TO

04:02:39.278 --> 04:02:41.747
RECOVER MORE OF THEIR DAMAGES.

04:02:41.813 --> 04:02:42.781
AND SO THESE ARE REALLY

04:02:42.848 --> 04:02:43.715
IMPORTANT CHANGES. AND THE

04:02:43.782 --> 04:02:45.584
REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE WHAT

04:02:45.651 --> 04:02:47.419
I HAVE LEARNED IN MY PRACTICE IS

04:02:47.486 --> 04:02:49.187
THAT IT OFTEN TAKES PEOPLE A

04:02:49.254 --> 04:02:50.489
LONG TIME TO LEARN THEY'RE BEING

04:02:50.555 --> 04:02:52.324
PAID LESS. THIS INFORMATION IS

04:02:52.391 --> 04:02:54.226
NOT READILY AVAILABLE, AND

04:02:54.293 --> 04:02:56.695
PEOPLE FIND THAT OUT IN VERY

04:02:56.762 --> 04:02:58.597
UNEXPECTED WAYS. I'VE SPOKEN TO

04:02:58.664 --> 04:03:00.432
A WOMAN WHO LEARNED THAT SHE WAS

04:03:00.499 --> 04:03:01.967
BEING PAID LESS WHEN, AFTER

04:03:02.034 --> 04:03:04.036
YEARS ON THE JOB, HER MALE

04:03:04.102 --> 04:03:05.871
COWORKER FINALLY TRUSTED HER

04:03:05.938 --> 04:03:07.239
ENOUGH TO TELL HER WHAT HE WAS

04:03:07.306 --> 04:03:10.042
BEING PAID. I SPOKE TO A WOMAN

04:03:10.108 --> 04:03:11.243
WHO GOT PROMOTED, AND ONCE SHE

04:03:11.310 --> 04:03:13.679
WAS PROMOTED, SHE'S MANAGING HER

04:03:13.745 --> 04:03:15.447
FORMER PEERS, HER COWORKERS, AND

04:03:15.514 --> 04:03:17.950
SHE LEARNED THAT EVEN AFTER HER

04:03:18.016 --> 04:03:19.851
PROMOTION, SHE WAS EARNING LESS

04:03:19.918 --> 04:03:21.586
THAN THE MEN WHO REPORTED TO

04:03:21.653 --> 04:03:24.456
HER. I SPOKE TO A WOMAN WHO WAS

04:03:24.523 --> 04:03:26.291
OFFERED A TRANSFER TO A POSITION

04:03:26.358 --> 04:03:27.592
AT THE SAME A POSITION IN A

04:03:27.659 --> 04:03:29.962
LOWER COST LOCALE, AND AS PART

04:03:30.028 --> 04:03:31.363
OF THAT PROCESS, SHE LEARNED

04:03:31.430 --> 04:03:33.165
THAT THE MALE INCUMBENT IN THAT

04:03:33.231 --> 04:03:35.701
POSITION, WHO HAD BEEN ON THE

04:03:35.767 --> 04:03:36.335
JOB FOR LESS FEWER YEARS, WAS

04:03:36.401 --> 04:03:37.469
EARNING MORE THAN THEY HAD

04:03:37.536 --> 04:03:40.038
OFFERED HER. SO PEOPLE DON'T.

04:03:40.105 --> 04:03:42.074
THIS IS HOW THEY FIND OUT THIS

04:03:42.140 --> 04:03:43.241
INFORMATION, AND WHEN THEY DO,

04:03:43.308 --> 04:03:45.377
IT CAN OFTEN BE TOO LATE TO

04:03:45.444 --> 04:03:48.246
EITHER BRING CLAIMS OR

04:03:48.313 --> 04:03:50.349
OFTENTIMES TOO LATE TO GET A

04:03:50.415 --> 04:03:53.585
FULL RECOVERY. AND THIS LAW IS

04:03:53.652 --> 04:03:55.854
DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THAT IN TWO

04:03:55.921 --> 04:03:57.589
DIFFERENT WAYS. ONE, IT

04:03:57.656 --> 04:03:59.024
INCREASES THE STATUTE OF

04:03:59.091 --> 04:04:01.660
LIMITATIONS TO BRING CLAIMS TO

04:04:01.727 --> 04:04:03.362
THREE YEARS, AND THAT'S

04:04:03.428 --> 04:04:05.197
CONSISTENT WITH OTHER

04:04:05.263 --> 04:04:06.231
ANTI-DISCRIMINATION LAWS IN

04:04:06.298 --> 04:04:07.699
CALIFORNIA, INCLUDING THE FAIR

04:04:07.766 --> 04:04:09.868
EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT. AND

04:04:09.935 --> 04:04:11.169
SECOND, IT SAYS THAT EMPLOYEES

04:04:11.236 --> 04:04:13.538
CAN RECOVER ALL OF THE WAGES

04:04:13.605 --> 04:04:15.540
THAT THEY HAVE LOST BECAUSE OF

04:04:15.607 --> 04:04:17.476
THEIR EMPLOYER'S UNLAWFUL PAY

04:04:17.542 --> 04:04:20.012
PRACTICE TO A MAXIMUM OF TEN

04:04:20.078 --> 04:04:21.713
YEARS. SO THAT MEANS THAT

04:04:21.780 --> 04:04:22.881
EMPLOYEES, ONCE THEY FIND OUT

04:04:22.948 --> 04:04:24.516
THAT THEY SUFFERED THIS DAMAGE,

04:04:24.583 --> 04:04:26.418
CAN GO BACK FOR TEN YEARS TO

04:04:26.485 --> 04:04:27.519
RECOVER. SO THAT'S REALLY

04:04:27.586 --> 04:04:28.320
IMPORTANT WHEN WE'RE TALKING

04:04:28.387 --> 04:04:31.123
ABOUT LIFETIME WAGE GAPS. BUT IT

04:04:31.189 --> 04:04:32.591
DOESN'T IMPOSE AN UNDUE BURDEN

04:04:32.657 --> 04:04:36.428
ON EMPLOYERS BECAUSE RECORD

04:04:36.495 --> 04:04:38.697
KEEPING REQUIREMENTS ALREADY

04:04:38.764 --> 04:04:40.799
EXIST UNDER EXISTING CALIFORNIA

04:04:40.866 --> 04:04:43.068
LAW, EMPLOYERS ARE REQUIRED TO

04:04:43.135 --> 04:04:45.504
KEEP JOB HISTORY AND PAY DATA

04:04:45.570 --> 04:04:47.606
FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THE

04:04:47.672 --> 04:04:49.408
EMPLOYER'S EMPLOYEES EMPLOYMENT

04:04:49.474 --> 04:04:52.778
TH¤U PLUS THREE YEARS, SO THAT

04:04:52.844 --> 04:04:54.246
THAT THERE'S NOT THAT BURDEN.

04:04:54.312 --> 04:04:55.981
THANK YOU. APPRECIATE IT. IS

04:04:56.048 --> 04:04:57.282

MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. ROBERT MØT

04:05:43.195 --> 04:05:44.229
FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF

04:05:44.296 --> 04:05:46.264
COMMERCE, FILLING IN FOR MY

04:05:46.331 --> 04:05:47.432
COLLEAGUE ASHLEY HOFFMAN. AND

04:05:47.499 --> 04:05:48.200
I'LL TRY TO BE BRIEF BECAUSE I

04:05:48.266 --> 04:05:49.401
KNOW EVERYONE HAS LUNCH PLANS.

04:05:49.468 --> 04:05:51.937
FIRST, ASHLEY ASKED ME TO REALLY

04:05:52.003 --> 04:05:52.804
THANK YOU FOR THE CONVERSATIONS.

04:05:52.871 --> 04:05:54.272
YOU'VE BEEN HAVING AMENDMENTS,

04:05:54.339 --> 04:05:54.940
WORKING ON THE BILL, SO WE

04:05:55.006 --> 04:05:55.974
APPRECIATE THAT. OUR ONLY

04:05:56.041 --> 04:05:56.608
OUTSTANDING CONCERN REALLY IS

04:05:56.675 --> 04:05:57.943
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

04:05:58.009 --> 04:05:58.743
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS THREE

04:05:58.810 --> 04:06:00.245
YEARS AND THE LOOKBACK PERIOD.

04:06:00.312 --> 04:06:01.813
WE THINK THE ANALYSIS FLAGS THE

04:06:01.880 --> 04:06:04.382
ISSUE WELL, IN TERMS OF CLAIMS

04:06:04.449 --> 04:06:05.450
THAT COULD BE FILED RECENTLY,

04:06:05.517 --> 04:06:06.818
BUT HAVE FACTUAL INQUIRIES THAT

04:06:06.885 --> 04:06:08.787
GO FAR BACK. YOU KNOW, AT A

04:06:08.854 --> 04:06:10.555
BASIC LEVEL, WE ARE CONCERNED

04:06:10.622 --> 04:06:11.456
ABOUT LITIGATING THE EVENTS OF

04:06:11.523 --> 04:06:12.591
THE PAST TEN YEARS, INCLUDING,

04:06:12.657 --> 04:06:14.526
YOU KNOW, ONE, WHETHER THE EQUAL

04:06:14.593 --> 04:06:15.260
PAY ACT WAS VIOLATED FOR THE

04:06:15.327 --> 04:06:17.195
DURATION OF THE PORTION OF THOSE

04:06:17.262 --> 04:06:18.930
YEARS. AND IF TWO WAS IF SO,

04:06:18.997 --> 04:06:20.098
WHAT'S THE APPROPRIATE RECOVERY?

04:06:20.165 --> 04:06:21.299
WE VIEW THIS AS FACT BASED

04:06:21.366 --> 04:06:22.334
INQUIRIES. I APPRECIATE THE

04:06:22.400 --> 04:06:23.435
COMMENT ABOUT DOCUMENTS BEING

04:06:23.502 --> 04:06:24.870
MAINTAINED, BUT WE THINK TO GO

04:06:24.936 --> 04:06:26.671
BACK AND DETERMINE THOSE THINGS

04:06:26.738 --> 04:06:27.873
FOR TEN YEARS IS ALSO GOING TO

04:06:27.939 --> 04:06:29.207
REQUIRE DEPOSITIONS AND PERSONAL

04:06:29.274 --> 04:06:29.808
DISCOVERY ISSUES THAT WE THINK

04:06:29.875 --> 04:06:31.376
WILL BE PROBLEMATIC. LOOKING TO

04:06:31.443 --> 04:06:32.777
OTHER STATES, WE THINK WE DON'T

04:06:32.844 --> 04:06:34.246
SEE MANY LAWS WITH SIMILAR TEN

04:06:34.312 --> 04:06:36.414
YEAR PERIODS. NOTABLY, THE ONLY

04:06:36.481 --> 04:06:37.949
OTHER COMPARABLE EQUAL PAY ACT

04:06:38.016 --> 04:06:39.484
WE'RE AWARE OF IS NEW JERSEY,

04:06:39.551 --> 04:06:41.586
WHICH HAS A SIX YEAR LOOK BACK

04:06:41.653 --> 04:06:42.521
PERIOD. SO FOR THOSE REASONS, WE

04:06:42.587 --> 04:06:44.089
MUST REMAIN OPPOSED UNLESS

04:06:44.156 --> 04:06:44.923
AMENDED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

04:06:44.990 --> 04:06:47.192

04:08:06.171 --> 04:08:07.205
KNOW, WE CAN DO BETTER THAN

04:08:07.272 --> 04:08:08.773
JERSEY, RIGHT? SO LIKE JERSEY'S

04:08:08.840 --> 04:08:10.442
DOING WE COULD DO TEN. YOU KNOW

04:08:10.508 --> 04:08:12.110
WE'RE NOT GOING TO STOP AT

04:08:12.177 --> 04:08:13.278
JERSEY LEVEL. WE CAN DO BETTER.

04:08:13.345 --> 04:08:16.047
AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU KNOW AGAIN

04:08:16.114 --> 04:08:17.315
THE DISPARITY HAS TO BE SHOWN

04:08:17.382 --> 04:08:20.485
AND PROVEN. AND IF SO TO THE TO

04:08:20.552 --> 04:08:23.321
THE POINT OF SUPPORT THE SUPPORT

04:08:23.388 --> 04:08:24.522
WITNESS. YOU KNOW, THESE RECORDS

04:08:24.589 --> 04:08:26.291
ARE KEPT DURING THE ENTIRE TIME

04:08:26.358 --> 04:08:27.325
OF EMPLOYMENT. YOU COULD EVEN GO

04:08:27.392 --> 04:08:28.460
FURTHER BACK THAN TEN. BUT I

04:08:28.526 --> 04:08:30.462
THINK TEN IS A REASONABLE PLACE,

04:08:30.528 --> 04:08:33.198
YOU KNOW, TO CREATE EQUITY. IF

04:08:33.265 --> 04:08:34.466
AGAIN, IF THAT DISPARITY IS

04:08:34.532 --> 04:08:36.301
PROVEN AND SOMETIMES IT TAKES

04:08:36.368 --> 04:08:37.602
EVEN MORE THAN THREE YEARS

04:08:37.669 --> 04:08:39.037
BEFORE ITS DISCOVERY. SO GOING

04:08:39.104 --> 04:08:40.805
TO THREE I THINK IS REASONABLE

04:08:40.872 --> 04:08:42.607
IN THAT SENSE, BECAUSE IT ALLOWS

04:08:42.674 --> 04:08:43.775
MORE OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY

04:08:43.842 --> 04:08:45.610
DISCOVER YOU ARE BEING YOU ARE A

04:08:45.677 --> 04:08:48.313
VICTIM OF THAT DISPARITY. SO I'M

04:08:48.380 --> 04:08:49.447
A BIG FAN OF THE BILL. ALSO

04:08:49.514 --> 04:08:51.449

04:15:57.975 --> 04:15:59.544
OFFICIAL APOLOGY FROM THE

04:15:59.610 --> 04:16:01.646
CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE TO

04:16:01.713 --> 04:16:04.148
CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLE. IT

04:16:04.215 --> 04:16:05.283
ACKNOWLEDGES ITS INVOLVEMENT IN

04:16:05.349 --> 04:16:07.285
THE HISTORIC INJUSTICES AND

04:16:07.351 --> 04:16:08.619
ATROCITIES COMMITTED AGAINST

04:16:08.686 --> 04:16:12.056
NATIVE AMERICANS, AND AFFIRMS

04:16:12.123 --> 04:16:13.524
THIS STATE'S COMMITMENT TO

04:16:13.591 --> 04:16:16.794
HEALING AND RECONCILIATION.

04:16:16.861 --> 04:16:18.529
CALIFORNIA JOINED THE UNION IN

04:16:18.596 --> 04:16:20.698
1850, AND THE STATE LEGISLATURE

04:16:20.765 --> 04:16:22.433
HAS YET TO OFFICIALLY APOLOGIZE

04:16:22.500 --> 04:16:24.669
FOR ITS OWN ROLE IN THE EARLY

04:16:24.736 --> 04:16:26.704
WARS AND MASSACRES WAGED AGAINST

04:16:26.771 --> 04:16:29.073
THE STATE'S FIRST PEOPLE.

04:16:29.140 --> 04:16:30.508
CERTAINLY, THERE HAS BEEN NO

04:16:30.575 --> 04:16:31.876
APOLOGY OR ACKNOWLEDGMENT FOR

04:16:31.943 --> 04:16:34.746
THE SANCTIONING AND PAYMENT OF

04:16:34.812 --> 04:16:36.814
BOUNTY HUNTERS TO KILL NATIVE

04:16:36.881 --> 04:16:41.285
AMERICANS. I'M SORRY THERE HAS

04:16:41.352 --> 04:16:43.020
BEEN NO APOLOGY OR

04:16:43.087 --> 04:16:44.288
ACKNOWLEDGMENT FOR THE SANCTION

04:16:44.355 --> 04:16:46.324
AND PAYMENT OF BOUNTY HUNTERS TO

04:16:46.390 --> 04:16:47.658
KILL NATIVE AMERICANS DURING

04:16:47.725 --> 04:16:49.894
THAT TIME FROM THE STATE

04:16:49.961 --> 04:16:53.731
LEGISLATURE BETWEEN 1851 AND

04:16:53.798 --> 04:16:57.468
1859. THE STATE RACKED UP OVER

04:16:57.535 --> 04:16:59.070
$1.2 MILLION IN ITS WAR AGAINST

04:16:59.137 --> 04:17:01.339
NATIVE AMERICANS IN THE STATE OF

04:17:01.405 --> 04:17:03.207
CALIFORNIA. THESE WERE TAXPAYERS

04:17:03.274 --> 04:17:05.276
DOLLARS USED TO ELIMINATE NATIVE

04:17:05.343 --> 04:17:06.878
PEOPLE IN THIS LAND IN THE STATE

04:17:06.944 --> 04:17:09.113
OF CALIFORNIA. THIS LEGISLATION,

04:17:09.180 --> 04:17:10.982
THAT LEGISLATION LED TO THE

04:17:11.048 --> 04:17:12.617
DESTRUCTION OF TRIBAL NATIONS

04:17:12.683 --> 04:17:14.418
ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND

04:17:14.485 --> 04:17:16.854
ALMOST WIPED OUT US AS A PEOPLE.

04:17:16.921 --> 04:17:20.491
IN 1852, THE LEGISLATURE VOTED

04:17:20.558 --> 04:17:22.894
TO OPPOSE THE RATIFICATION OF 18

04:17:22.960 --> 04:17:24.595
TREATIES MADE BETWEEN THE UNITED

04:17:24.662 --> 04:17:26.063
STATES GOVERNMENT AND CALIFORNIA

04:17:26.130 --> 04:17:30.201
NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES. IN 1860,

04:17:30.268 --> 04:17:32.003
MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE

04:17:32.069 --> 04:17:33.704
INVESTIGATING THE MENDOCINO WARS

04:17:33.771 --> 04:17:35.439
CALLED FOR THE OUTRIGHT TAKEOVER

04:17:35.506 --> 04:17:38.075
OF TRIBAL AFFAIRS BY THE STATE

04:17:38.142 --> 04:17:40.311
GOVERNMENT AND FOR THE

04:17:40.378 --> 04:17:41.646
ENSLAVEMENT OF THE REMAINING

04:17:41.712 --> 04:17:43.581
NATIVES OF THE STATE BY

04:17:43.648 --> 04:17:46.117
SO-CALLED RESPONSIBLE CITIZENS.

04:17:46.184 --> 04:17:48.152
THE HISTORY OF VIOLENCE AGAINST

04:17:48.219 --> 04:17:49.687
CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLE

04:17:49.754 --> 04:17:51.055
CREATED AND INSTILLED TRAUMA

04:17:51.122 --> 04:17:53.591
THAT CONTINUES TO IMPACT NATIVE

04:17:53.658 --> 04:17:55.493
AMERICANS TO THIS DAY. THIS IS

04:17:55.560 --> 04:17:57.995
THE LEGACY OF OUR STATE'S

04:17:58.062 --> 04:17:59.797
LEGISLATURE AND WHY I INTRODUCED

04:17:59.864 --> 04:18:02.333
H.R. 18. ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNOR

04:18:02.400 --> 04:18:03.668
ISSUED HIS APOLOGY ON BEHALF OF

04:18:03.734 --> 04:18:06.270
THE STATE IN 2019, THIS BODY,

04:18:06.337 --> 04:18:08.973
THIS INSTITUTION, WHICH PASSED

04:18:09.040 --> 04:18:11.209
LEGISLATION FACILITATING THE

04:18:11.275 --> 04:18:13.377
REMOVAL OF NATIVE AMERICANS, HAS

04:18:13.444 --> 04:18:16.247
NOT DONE SO. WE CAN NEVER FIX

04:18:16.314 --> 04:18:18.249
THE WRONGDOINGS OF THE PAST, BUT

04:18:18.316 --> 04:18:20.718
WE CAN. WHAT WE CAN DO IS TAKE

04:18:20.785 --> 04:18:23.421
THE FIRST STEP OF ENSURING THIS

04:18:23.487 --> 04:18:25.223
BODY TAKES THE FUNDAMENTAL STEP

04:18:25.289 --> 04:18:27.491
OF ACKNOWLEDGING THE HARM

04:18:27.558 --> 04:18:29.193
COMMITTED, AND STATE ITS

04:18:29.260 --> 04:18:30.695
INTENTIONS TO PREVENT THESE

04:18:30.761 --> 04:18:32.496
INJUSTICES FROM HAPPENING IN THE

04:18:32.563 --> 04:18:35.032
FUTURE. I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

04:18:35.099 --> 04:18:36.868
THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE

04:18:36.934 --> 04:18:42.240
HERE IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 18? IS

04:18:42.306 --> 04:18:43.541
THERE ANYONE HERE IN OPPOSITION

04:18:43.608 --> 04:18:47.678
TO H.R. 18? I WILL BRING IT BACK

04:18:47.745 --> 04:18:51.082
TO THE COMMITTEE. AS SENATOR

04:18:51.148 --> 04:18:55.219
BRYANT. THANK YOU. HAPPY TO BE

04:18:55.286 --> 04:18:57.255
ADDED AS A COAUTHOR IF YOU'RE

04:18:57.321 --> 04:18:58.389
TAKING COAUTHORS. AND REALLY

04:18:58.456 --> 04:19:01.592
GRATEFUL. TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM

04:19:01.659 --> 04:19:03.661
SAN BERNARDINO FOR BRINGING THIS

04:19:03.728 --> 04:19:04.395
FORWARD. THIS SEEMS EERILY

04:19:04.462 --> 04:19:06.130
FAMILIAR TO SOMETHING THAT WAS

04:19:06.197 --> 04:19:07.765
DONE BY THE LEGISLATIVE BLACK

04:19:07.832 --> 04:19:10.635
CAUCUS LAST YEAR BY ASSEMBLY

04:19:10.701 --> 04:19:12.436
MEMBER JONES SAWYER, WHO'S NO

04:19:12.503 --> 04:19:14.538
LONGER SERVING WITH US. AND I

04:19:14.605 --> 04:19:16.707
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AND

04:19:16.774 --> 04:19:18.976
APPROPRIATE. IT TOOK TWO YEARS

04:19:19.043 --> 04:19:20.011
OF DELIBERATION IN THE

04:19:20.077 --> 04:19:21.345
CALIFORNIA REPARATIONS TASK

04:19:21.412 --> 04:19:23.381
FORCE TO COME UP WITH A SERIES

04:19:23.447 --> 04:19:24.582
OF RECOMMENDATIONS, INCLUDING A

04:19:24.649 --> 04:19:26.484
STATE APOLOGY. AND I THINK

04:19:26.550 --> 04:19:27.518
ANYTIME THE STATE HAS

04:19:27.585 --> 04:19:28.920
PARTICIPATED IN HARM AGAINST

04:19:28.986 --> 04:19:30.788
ANY, ANY PEOPLE, WHETHER IT'S

04:19:30.855 --> 04:19:32.089
BLACK AMERICANS, CALIFORNIANS,

04:19:32.156 --> 04:19:34.358
FIRST PEOPLE OR ANYONE ELSE WHO

04:19:34.425 --> 04:19:35.559
HAS CALLED CALIFORNIA HOME

04:19:35.626 --> 04:19:38.429
DURING OUR HISTORY AS A STATE,

04:19:38.496 --> 04:19:40.831
AN APOLOGY IS NECESSARY AND

04:19:40.898 --> 04:19:43.200
REPAIR IS NEEDED. I ALSO THINK

04:19:43.267 --> 04:19:44.702
IT'S IMPORTANT TO STAND IN

04:19:44.769 --> 04:19:45.670
SOLIDARITY WITH OTHER

04:19:45.736 --> 04:19:47.071
COMMUNITIES AS THEY SEEK PROPER

04:19:47.138 --> 04:19:48.873
REDRESS AND REPAIR FOR THE HARMS

04:19:48.940 --> 04:19:49.774
THAT THEY'VE EXPERIENCED, AND SO

SURE WHAT THE PROCESS IS ON A

04:20:20.504 --> 04:20:23.374

04:20:23.441 --> 04:20:25.509
OBVIOUSLY YOU CONTINUE TO DO

04:20:25.576 --> 04:20:27.778

04:20:27.845 --> 04:20:28.646
FEELS LIKE YOU'RE DOING IT

04:20:28.713 --> 04:20:30.815

04:20:53.838 --> 04:20:55.706
DISCUSSIONS. AND HOPEFULLY IT'S

04:20:55.773 --> 04:20:57.108

ADDED AS A COAUTHOR AS WELL. AND

04:21:20.231 --> 04:21:21.599

04:21:26.570 --> 04:21:31.409
IS IMPORTANT, AND I ADMIRE YOUR

04:21:33.144 --> 04:21:34.645
AND YOUR COURAGE ALL THESE YEARS

04:21:34.712 --> 04:21:36.147
THAT I'VE KNOWN YOU AND THAT

04:21:36.213 --> 04:21:38.049
I'VE BEEN HERE AND APPRECIATE

04:21:38.115 --> 04:21:39.016
WHAT YOU'RE DOING. I MEAN, THE

04:21:39.083 --> 04:21:42.186
FIRST PEOPLE, I MEAN, YOU WERE

04:21:42.253 --> 04:21:44.722
FIRST. AND I RESPECT THAT. I DO

04:21:44.789 --> 04:21:47.992
HAVE A QUESTION. IS, IS THIS

04:21:48.059 --> 04:21:50.027
FOUNDATIONAL? IF YOU'RE MODELING

04:21:50.094 --> 04:21:52.263
AFTER OTHER LIKE THE REPARATIONS

04:21:52.329 --> 04:21:53.831
TASK FORCE, OR ARE WE GOING TO

04:21:53.898 --> 04:21:57.601
BE LOOKING TO FURTHER STUDIES

04:21:57.668 --> 04:22:00.104
AND GETTING INTO DIFFERENCES AND

04:22:00.171 --> 04:22:03.741
HOW THEY GET REMEDIED IN THE

04:22:03.808 --> 04:22:07.344
21ST CENTURY? OR OR IS THIS

04:22:07.411 --> 04:22:08.946
APOLOGY ONLY, OR WHERE DO YOU

04:22:09.013 --> 04:22:12.049
SEE THIS GOING? SO THANK YOU FOR

04:22:12.116 --> 04:22:14.251
THE QUESTION. AND REALLY THIS

04:22:14.318 --> 04:22:15.719
RESOLUTION IS PLAYING CATCH UP

04:22:15.786 --> 04:22:16.854
TO WHAT THIS LEGISLATURE HAS

04:22:16.921 --> 04:22:18.255
ALREADY BEEN WORKING ON MISSING

04:22:18.322 --> 04:22:20.024
AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS WOMEN,

04:22:20.091 --> 04:22:22.593
FEATHER ALERT, AND A SERIES OF

04:22:22.660 --> 04:22:24.428
OTHERS PL 280 THAT WE HAD TO

04:22:24.495 --> 04:22:26.030
BRING AND DO A WHOLE EDUCATION

04:22:26.097 --> 04:22:27.131
AROUND THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T EVEN

04:22:27.198 --> 04:22:29.400
KNOW WHAT PUBLIC LAW 280 WAS.

04:22:29.467 --> 04:22:30.768
THIS IS ACTUALLY A FOLLOW

04:22:30.835 --> 04:22:32.103
THROUGH OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE

04:22:32.169 --> 04:22:34.638
AND ITS APOLOGY, AND TO CONTINUE

04:22:34.705 --> 04:22:36.674
TO WORK ON THOSE AREAS THAT HAVE

04:22:36.740 --> 04:22:39.043
CAUSED HISTORICAL TRAUMA AND

04:22:39.110 --> 04:22:41.645
RESOURCES, BRING RESOURCES TO

04:22:41.712 --> 04:22:42.947
INDIAN COUNTRY HERE IN THE STATE

04:22:43.013 --> 04:22:44.482
OF CALIFORNIA. SO THIS IS

04:22:44.548 --> 04:22:45.583
ACTUALLY FOLLOWING UP ON ALL THE

04:22:45.649 --> 04:22:46.917
WORK THAT WE'VE ALREADY BEEN

04:22:46.984 --> 04:22:49.086
DOING, WHICH I VOTED YES ON ALL

04:22:49.153 --> 04:22:51.122
THOSE MATTERS. I LOOK FORWARD TO

04:22:51.188 --> 04:22:52.756
YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT. AND I

04:22:52.823 --> 04:22:54.158
THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT,

04:22:54.225 --> 04:22:55.392
PARTICULARLY ON INDIGENOUS WOMEN

04:22:55.459 --> 04:22:57.094
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT RELATED

04:22:57.161 --> 04:22:58.529
ISSUES, PUBLIC SAFETY TYPE

04:22:58.596 --> 04:23:01.031
ISSUES. SO I COMMEND YOU TO DO

04:23:01.098 --> 04:23:03.067
THAT. SO I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THE

04:23:03.134 --> 04:23:04.735
APOLOGY AND THE PAST WORK THAT

04:23:04.802 --> 04:23:06.770
YOU'VE BEEN DOING. SO I LOOK

04:23:06.837 --> 04:23:08.839
FORWARD TO THIS HOPEFULLY

04:23:08.906 --> 04:23:10.708
SETTING A RECORD THAT IS

04:23:10.774 --> 04:23:12.643
IMPORTANT TO YOU AND YOUR

04:23:12.710 --> 04:23:14.879
PEOPLE. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU

04:23:14.945 --> 04:23:17.581
SO MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

04:23:17.648 --> 04:23:18.949
BRINGING THIS FORWARD. WHEN I

04:23:19.016 --> 04:23:21.252
USED TO TEACH AT SAN JOSE STATE

04:23:21.318 --> 04:23:22.353
UNIVERSITY IN LINCOLN LAW

04:23:22.419 --> 04:23:23.754
SCHOOL, A COURSE CALLED RACE AND

04:23:23.821 --> 04:23:25.156
THE LAW. THE FIRST SECTION WAS

04:23:25.222 --> 04:23:27.324
ON NATIVE AMERICAN SOVEREIGNTY,

04:23:27.391 --> 04:23:29.860
AND MANY OF THE ATROCITIES THAT

04:23:29.927 --> 04:23:32.096
WERE NOT JUST DONE IN SOME KIND

04:23:32.163 --> 04:23:34.498
OF KIND OF OTHERS SENSE, BUT WAS

04:23:34.565 --> 04:23:35.799
ACTUALLY DONE BY US. AND I

04:23:35.866 --> 04:23:36.967
REALLY APPRECIATE YOU POINTING

04:23:37.034 --> 04:23:39.170
OUT THIS IS THE LEGACY OF OUR

04:23:39.236 --> 04:23:40.237
STATE LEGISLATURE, OUR

04:23:40.304 --> 04:23:41.605
GOVERNORS, YOU KNOW, BUT WHO WAS

04:23:41.672 --> 04:23:43.440
HERE LITERALLY ON THESE FLOORS

04:23:43.507 --> 04:23:46.076
BEFORE US. AND IT'S UP TO US TO

04:23:46.143 --> 04:23:47.511
MAKE IT RIGHT TO THE BEST WE THE

04:23:47.578 --> 04:23:49.613
BEST WE CAN. YOU MENTIONED OTHER

04:23:49.680 --> 04:23:51.015
POLICIES WE'RE WORKING ON, BUT I

04:23:51.081 --> 04:23:53.217
THINK THE FORMAL APOLOGY IS NOT

04:23:53.284 --> 04:23:54.618
JUST SYMBOLIC. IT MEANS

04:23:54.685 --> 04:23:55.819
SOMETHING, AND IT MEANS

04:23:55.886 --> 04:23:57.154
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT FOR US

04:23:57.221 --> 04:23:59.690
TO CONTINUE IN OUR WORK, TO TRY

04:23:59.757 --> 04:24:01.225
TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT. AND WE HAD

04:24:01.292 --> 04:24:02.660
SOME CONVERSATION ON THIS, YOU

04:24:02.726 --> 04:24:04.128
KNOW, I MEAN, YOU MENTIONED

04:24:04.195 --> 04:24:05.262
TALKING ABOUT THE FIRST

04:24:05.329 --> 04:24:07.998
GOVERNOR, PETER BURNETT, AND THE

04:24:08.065 --> 04:24:09.767
HORRIBLE ATROCITIES, LITERALLY,

04:24:09.833 --> 04:24:11.035
ALONG WITH LEGISLATURE DECLARING

04:24:11.101 --> 04:24:14.171
A WAR AGAINST NATIVE PEOPLE. AND

04:24:14.238 --> 04:24:16.974
I THINK TO WHATEVER EXTENT THAT

04:24:17.041 --> 04:24:18.776
CAN BE HIGHLIGHTED, BECAUSE WE

04:24:18.842 --> 04:24:20.578
HAVE PICTURES OF HIM AND OTHERS

04:24:20.644 --> 04:24:24.615
IN OUR CAPITAL, AND I THINK IT

04:24:24.682 --> 04:24:28.152
SHOULD BE KNOWN THAT, YES, THEY

04:24:28.219 --> 04:24:29.553
WERE FORMER GOVERNORS OR

04:24:29.620 --> 04:24:32.089
WHATEVER, BUT THEIR ACTIONS

04:24:32.156 --> 04:24:36.827
SHOULD ALSO BE CLEARLY TOLD,

04:24:36.894 --> 04:24:37.528
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE

04:24:37.595 --> 04:24:38.896
THOUSANDS OF VISITORS COMING

04:24:38.963 --> 04:24:40.497
THROUGH HERE. I ALWAYS GET

04:24:40.564 --> 04:24:42.700
UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN I SEE IT AND

04:24:42.766 --> 04:24:43.901
I'M NOT INDIGENOUS. I CAN ONLY

04:24:43.968 --> 04:24:45.502
IMAGINE SOME OF THE RAGE THAT

04:24:45.569 --> 04:24:46.837
OTHERS FEEL BECAUSE OF WHAT

04:24:46.904 --> 04:24:49.006
HAPPENED TO THEIR ANCESTORS. SO

04:24:49.073 --> 04:24:50.541
ANYWAY, I JUST WANT TO A LONG

04:24:50.608 --> 04:24:52.376
WAY OF SAYING I'M VERY GRATEFUL

04:24:52.443 --> 04:24:54.144
FOR YOU AND THE WORK YOU'RE

04:24:54.211 --> 04:24:54.945
DOING. BUT I'D ALSO LIKE TO BE

04:24:55.012 --> 04:24:57.948
ADDED AS A COAUTHOR. WOULD YOU

04:24:58.015 --> 04:24:58.449
LIKE TO CLOSE? THANK YOU

04:24:58.515 --> 04:25:00.918
CHAIRMAN, AND IT TRULY IS AN

04:25:00.985 --> 04:25:04.088
OPPORTUNITY TO RIGHT A WRONG AND

04:25:04.154 --> 04:25:06.023
BECOME THAT EDUCATIONAL PROCESS

04:25:06.090 --> 04:25:07.758
FOR THE HISTORY OF THE STATE OF

04:25:07.825 --> 04:25:09.226
CALIFORNIA AND MOVING FORWARD ON

04:25:09.293 --> 04:25:11.695
THE ISSUES THAT THIS BODY HAS

04:25:11.762 --> 04:25:13.464
TACKLED OVER THE YEARS, AND

04:25:13.530 --> 04:25:15.733
COMING AS FAR AS REPATRIATION

04:25:15.799 --> 04:25:17.201
AND THOSE TYPES OF THINGS FROM

04:25:17.268 --> 04:25:18.936
CAL STATE UNIVERSITIES. I DO

04:25:19.003 --> 04:25:21.071
WANT TO HIGHLIGHT AND

04:25:21.138 --> 04:25:22.439
ACKNOWLEDGE THE COMMITTEE'S

04:25:22.506 --> 04:25:24.074
ANALYSIS AND THE GREAT WORK THAT

04:25:24.141 --> 04:25:24.942
WAS DONE IN BRINGING THAT

04:25:25.009 --> 04:25:26.810
HISTORY FORWARD. READ THAT

04:25:26.877 --> 04:25:29.880
ANALYSIS, AND I TRULY WANT TO

04:25:29.947 --> 04:25:31.115
HONOR THAT, BECAUSE IT TRULY IS

04:25:31.181 --> 04:25:33.417
SOMETHING THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE

04:25:33.484 --> 04:25:35.052
DONE AND BE TOLD. AND SO IT'S

04:25:35.119 --> 04:25:36.620
THE BEGINNING. IT'S THE

04:25:36.687 --> 04:25:38.689
BEGINNING OF CORRECTING A LOT OF

04:25:38.756 --> 04:25:40.958
HISTORY, BUT ALSO BRINGING

04:26:41.518 --> 04:26:43.587
OVERDUE STEP TOWARD JUSTICE. I

BRING THIS RESOLUTION FORWARD

COUNTRY'S IMMIGRATION LAWS HAVE

04:26:52.963 --> 04:26:55.065
NOT BEEN UPDATED IN NEARLY 40

04:26:55.132 --> 04:26:56.567
YEARS, EVEN AS MILLIONS OF

04:26:56.633 --> 04:26:58.202

04:27:00.537 --> 04:27:01.872
NEIGHBORS, COWORKERS, AND

04:27:01.939 --> 04:27:02.873
FRIENDS. THEY ARE PEOPLE WHO

04:27:02.940 --> 04:27:05.042
HAVE BUILT LIVES HERE BUT REMAIN

04:27:05.109 --> 04:27:06.210
WITH AN UNRESOLVED, UNRESOLVED

04:27:06.276 --> 04:27:08.145
LEGAL STATUS. CALIFORNIA IS HOME

04:27:08.212 --> 04:27:09.813
TO OVER 10 MILLION IMMIGRANTS,

04:27:09.880 --> 04:27:11.648
AND MANY OF THEM HAVE LIVED HERE

04:27:11.715 --> 04:27:13.917
FOR MORE THAN A DECADE. THEY'VE

04:27:13.984 --> 04:27:15.119
RAISED CHILDREN HERE. THEY PAY

04:27:15.185 --> 04:27:16.720
TAXES. THEY SHOW UP EVERY DAY

04:27:16.787 --> 04:27:17.755
FOR WORK AND FOR THEIR

04:27:17.821 --> 04:27:19.923
COMMUNITIES. 1 IN 10 WORKERS IN

04:27:19.990 --> 04:27:21.258
CALIFORNIA IS UNDOCUMENTED, AND

04:27:21.325 --> 04:27:23.460
THEY CONTRIBUTE MORE THAN $8.5

04:27:23.527 --> 04:27:25.229
BILLION ANNUALLY IN CALIFORNIA

04:27:25.295 --> 04:27:27.765

WORKFORCE, AND YET THEY REMAIN

04:27:30.401 --> 04:27:31.869
EXCLUDED FROM THE BENEFITS OF

04:27:31.935 --> 04:27:35.072
LEGAL STATUS. HCR 17 URGES THE

04:27:35.139 --> 04:27:36.907
ASSEMBLY AND SENATE TO SUPPORT

04:27:36.974 --> 04:27:38.442
FEDERAL LEGISLATION THAT WOULD

04:27:38.509 --> 04:27:40.110
UPDATE THE CURRENT REGISTRY

04:27:40.177 --> 04:27:41.912
STATUTE SO THAT IMMIGRANTS MAY

04:27:41.979 --> 04:27:43.447
QUALIFY FOR A LAWFUL PERMANENT

04:27:43.514 --> 04:27:44.748

FILING AN APPLICATION FOR LAWFUL

PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS. FOR

04:27:52.823 --> 04:27:53.824
MANY, THIS WOULD MEAN FINALLY

04:27:53.891 --> 04:27:54.825
LIVING WITHOUT FEAR OF

04:27:54.892 --> 04:27:57.060
SEPARATION FROM FAMILY, OF

EVERYTHING THEY'VE WORKED SO

04:27:59.696 --> 04:28:02.132
HARD FOR. THIS IS NOT JUST A

04:28:02.199 --> 04:28:03.100
POLICY ISSUE, IT'S ABOUT DOING

04:28:03.167 --> 04:28:04.835

ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION, I

04:32:17.421 --> 04:32:18.955
THINK THE POINT OF IT IS REALLY

04:32:19.022 --> 04:32:20.490
POWERFUL AND IMPORTANT, AND THAT

04:32:20.557 --> 04:32:22.292
IS THAT WE HAVE A BROKEN

04:32:22.359 --> 04:32:23.727
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. WE TALK

04:32:23.794 --> 04:32:24.795
ABOUT PEOPLE GOING THROUGH THE

04:32:24.861 --> 04:32:26.963
LEGAL PATHWAY, RECOGNIZING THAT

04:32:27.030 --> 04:32:29.900
THAT LEGAL PATHWAY IS NOT

04:32:29.966 --> 04:32:31.334
CERTAIN, EVER CHANGING. AND

04:32:31.401 --> 04:32:33.804
RIGHT NOW SEEMINGLY NONEXISTENT.

04:32:33.870 --> 04:32:35.238
AND INSTEAD OF CONGRESS AND THE

04:32:35.305 --> 04:32:37.407
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOING THE JOB

04:32:37.474 --> 04:32:39.276
THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY ASKING OF

04:32:39.342 --> 04:32:41.111
THEM, WHICH IS TO COME UP WITH A

04:32:41.178 --> 04:32:42.612
COMPREHENSIVE AND THOUGHTFUL,

04:32:42.679 --> 04:32:44.381
HUMANE, DIGNIFIED WAY TO

04:32:44.448 --> 04:32:46.016
IMMIGRATE TO THIS COUNTRY.

04:32:46.083 --> 04:32:47.551
THEY'RE STAGING PHOTO OPS IN

04:32:47.617 --> 04:32:51.955
MACARTHUR PARK, MOVING WELL OVER

04:32:52.022 --> 04:32:55.292
$100 BILLION TO BUILD DETENTION

CAMPS IN EIGHT DAYS, AND SWAMPS

04:32:57.728 --> 04:32:59.129
THAT ARE ALREADY FLOODED IN

04:32:59.196 --> 04:33:01.565
FLORIDA. THIS ISN'T THE PATHWAY

04:33:01.631 --> 04:33:04.067
FORWARD. WHAT IS THE HARD WORK,

04:33:04.134 --> 04:33:06.203
THE POLICYMAKING WORK, WHICH,

04:33:06.269 --> 04:33:07.337
SURPRISINGLY, IS SOMETHING THAT

04:33:07.404 --> 04:33:09.840
FORMER PRESIDENT REAGAN ENGAGED

04:33:09.906 --> 04:33:12.375
IN BACK IN THE 80S AND WAS LEFT

04:33:12.442 --> 04:33:14.177
UNFINISHED. SO THANK YOU TO THE

04:33:14.244 --> 04:33:16.480
AUTHOR FOR REMINDING CALIFORNIA

04:33:16.546 --> 04:33:18.215
OF OUR ROLE IN IMMIGRATION, BOTH

04:33:18.281 --> 04:33:21.151
AS A STATE AND HAVING SENT ONE

04:33:21.218 --> 04:33:23.086
OF OUR GOVERNORS TO THE WHITE

04:33:23.153 --> 04:33:26.056

04:33:26.123 --> 04:33:28.825

SEEK A BETTER LIFE AND GET THEIR

04:33:33.697 --> 04:33:35.232
PLACE OF THE AMERICAN DREAM.

04:33:35.298 --> 04:33:36.600
I'VE SAID IT A FEW DIFFERENT

04:33:36.666 --> 04:33:39.369
TIMES AND PLACES. WE ALL EXIST

04:33:39.436 --> 04:33:43.740
ON STOLEN LAND. SOME OF US WERE

04:33:43.807 --> 04:33:46.409
STOLEN AND BROUGHT TO THIS LAND.

04:33:46.476 --> 04:33:48.011

BY OUR COLLEAGUE, YOU KNOW, THIS

04:34:24.347 --> 04:34:26.917
IS CALLING ON LEGISLATION THAT

04:34:26.983 --> 04:34:29.252
WOULD AMEND THE ORIGINAL

SHOWS HOW FAR WE HAVE COME, AND

04:34:39.496 --> 04:34:41.631
NOT IN A GOOD WAY. BUT AT THE

END OF THE DAY, WE HAVE TO STAND

04:34:43.600 --> 04:34:46.303
UP FOR WHAT WE KNOW TO BELIEVE

04:34:46.369 --> 04:34:47.938
IS RIGHT, AND THE TRUTH AND THE

04:34:48.004 --> 04:34:49.606
TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT WE

04:34:49.673 --> 04:34:51.174
HAVE FAR TOO MANY PEOPLE THAT

04:34:51.241 --> 04:34:53.276

04:43:00.196 --> 04:43:00.863
BROWN. IN JANUARY, OUR ENTIRE

04:43:00.930 --> 04:43:02.532
MOBILE HOME PARK, PACIFIC

04:43:02.598 --> 04:43:04.734
PALISADES BOWL IN IN PACIFIC

04:43:04.801 --> 04:43:06.569
PALISADES BURNED TO THE GROUND.

04:43:06.636 --> 04:43:08.471
OVER A THOUSAND OF US WERE

04:43:08.538 --> 04:43:09.439
DISPLACED OVERNIGHT. MONTHS

04:43:09.505 --> 04:43:10.940
LATER, WE'RE STILL IN LIMBO.

04:43:11.007 --> 04:43:13.009
WE'RE UNABLE TO KNOW WHETHER

04:43:13.076 --> 04:43:14.944
WE'RE GOING TO EVER RETURN BACK

04:43:15.011 --> 04:43:16.813
TO OUR HOMES. TEN YEARS AGO,

04:43:16.879 --> 04:43:18.681
WHEN MY WIFE AND I COULDN'T

04:43:18.748 --> 04:43:19.449
AFFORD A TRADITIONAL HOME, WE

04:43:19.515 --> 04:43:21.250
FOUND THIS PARK. IT OFFERED

04:43:21.317 --> 04:43:23.119
SOMETHING RARE AND AFFORDABLE AN

04:43:23.186 --> 04:43:24.921
AFFORDABLE, SINGLE FAMILY LIKE

04:43:24.987 --> 04:43:26.422
HOME BY THE BEACH, WHERE WE

04:43:26.489 --> 04:43:28.157
RAISED OUR TWO CHILDREN AND HAVE

04:43:28.224 --> 04:43:29.959
BEEN BUILDING OUR LIFE. OUR

04:43:30.026 --> 04:43:32.028
NEIGHBORS WERE RETIRED TEACHERS,

04:43:32.095 --> 04:43:34.597
LIFEGUARDS, NURSES. OVER 50% ARE

04:43:34.664 --> 04:43:36.432
SENIOR CITIZENS WHO BECAME

04:43:36.499 --> 04:43:37.867
GRANDPARENTS TO MY CHILDREN. WE

04:43:37.934 --> 04:43:39.602
DIDN'T JUST RENT, WE OWNED OUR

04:43:39.669 --> 04:43:41.904
HOMES AND WE BUILT A REAL

04:43:41.971 --> 04:43:42.905
COMMUNITY MOBILE HOME PARKS JUST

04:43:42.972 --> 04:43:45.875
LIKE OURS. THEY AREN'T JUST

04:43:45.942 --> 04:43:46.976
AFFORDABLE, THEY'RE OFTEN THE

04:43:47.043 --> 04:43:48.811
BEST AND MOST APPROPRIATE USE OF

04:43:48.878 --> 04:43:49.479
THE LAND. PALISADES BOWL SITS ON

04:43:49.545 --> 04:43:51.948
AN ACTIVE LANDSLIDE ZONE.

04:43:52.014 --> 04:43:53.015
LIGHTWEIGHT MANUFACTURED HOMES

04:43:53.082 --> 04:43:54.851
ARE SAFER, MORE FLEXIBLE AND

04:43:54.917 --> 04:43:56.953
MORE PRACTICAL THAN DENSE

04:43:57.019 --> 04:43:58.788
DEVELOPMENT IN AREAS LIKE THIS.

04:43:58.855 --> 04:44:00.356
THE LANDOWNERS WHO BOUGHT THESE

04:44:00.423 --> 04:44:02.125
PARKS KNEW WHAT THEY WERE BUYING

04:44:02.191 --> 04:44:03.059
LAND ZONED AND PROTECTED FOR

04:44:03.126 --> 04:44:04.527
MOBILE HOME USE, WITH LONG

04:44:04.594 --> 04:44:06.396
STANDING RESIDENTS WHO INVESTED

04:44:06.462 --> 04:44:07.530
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS

04:44:07.597 --> 04:44:09.632
INTO THEIR HOMES. SO IF AN OWNER

04:44:09.699 --> 04:44:11.467
WANTS TO CHANGE THAT USE, WHICH

04:44:11.534 --> 04:44:14.103
I AGREE THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO

04:44:14.170 --> 04:44:15.138
UNDER CERTAIN PROTECTIONS FOR

04:44:15.204 --> 04:44:16.739
THE RESIDENTS WHO LIVE THERE, IF

04:44:16.806 --> 04:44:18.908
THEY WANT TO SHUT DOWN OR

04:44:18.975 --> 04:44:20.476
REDEVELOP THE PARK. IT'S ONLY

04:44:20.543 --> 04:44:21.811
FAIR THAT THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE

04:44:21.878 --> 04:44:23.179
THERE WHO ALREADY BUILT THEIR

04:44:23.246 --> 04:44:24.947
LIVES THERE, GET A REAL,

04:44:25.014 --> 04:44:26.616
REGULATED OPPORTUNITY TO

04:44:26.682 --> 04:44:28.184
PURCHASE THAT LAND BEFORE BEING

04:44:28.251 --> 04:44:31.554
PERMANENTLY DISPLACED. SB 749

04:44:31.621 --> 04:44:32.722
STRIKES. THAT BALANCE DOESN'T

04:44:32.789 --> 04:44:34.390
STOP LANDOWNERS FROM CHANGING.

04:44:34.457 --> 04:44:36.626
USE SIMPLY ENSURES A FAIR

04:44:36.692 --> 04:44:37.994
PROCESS, PROPER NOTICE, A

04:44:38.060 --> 04:44:40.096
TRANSPARENT BUYOUT OPPORTUNITY,

04:44:40.163 --> 04:44:41.731
AND A PATH FOR RESIDENTS TO STAY

04:44:41.798 --> 04:44:43.766
IN THEIR HOMES. WITHOUT THIS

04:44:43.833 --> 04:44:44.834
LEGISLATION, WE COULD BE

04:44:44.901 --> 04:44:46.235
DISPLACED INDEFINITELY. WITH IT,

04:44:46.302 --> 04:44:48.805
WE HAVE A CHANCE TO REBUILD AND

04:44:48.871 --> 04:44:49.605
PRESERVE ONE OF THE LAST

04:44:49.672 --> 04:44:51.307
AFFORDABLE HOME OWNERSHIP

04:44:51.374 --> 04:44:51.974
OPPORTUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA

04:44:52.041 --> 04:44:54.377
ALONG THE COAST. ON MY ON BEHALF

04:44:54.444 --> 04:44:55.711
OF MY FAMILY, MY NEIGHBORS, AND

04:44:55.778 --> 04:44:58.314
THOUSANDS LIKE THIS AND LIKE US,

I URGE YOUR SUPPORT ON SB 749.

04:45:01.050 --> 04:45:03.286

INCOME CLIENTS, WE ASSIST

04:45:15.832 --> 04:45:16.933
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN

04:45:16.999 --> 04:45:18.668
MOBILE HOME PARKS EACH YEAR, AND

04:45:18.734 --> 04:45:20.203
IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS, WE'VE

04:45:20.269 --> 04:45:21.737
PROVIDED LEGAL SERVICES IN

04:45:21.804 --> 04:45:24.040
RESPONSE TO MULTIPLE DISASTER

04:45:24.106 --> 04:45:25.608
DECLARATIONS, INCLUDING THE CAMP

04:45:25.675 --> 04:45:27.977
FIRE IN PARADISE, BUTTE COUNTY,

04:45:28.044 --> 04:45:30.213
THE 34 DAMAGED OR DESTROYED

04:45:30.279 --> 04:45:32.148
MOBILE HOME PARKS THAT WERE

04:45:32.215 --> 04:45:34.183
DESTROYED IN THE CAMP FIRE

04:45:34.250 --> 04:45:35.351
REPRESENTED SOME OF THE ONLY

04:45:35.418 --> 04:45:36.419
AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPTIONS FOR

04:45:36.486 --> 04:45:39.655
MANY OF OUR CLIENTS. SB 749

04:45:39.722 --> 04:45:41.290
DIRECTLY ADDRESSES SOME OF THE

04:45:41.357 --> 04:45:43.559
PROBLEMS WE SAW HOMEOWNERS FACE

04:45:43.626 --> 04:45:45.361
WHO LIVED IN THESE DAMAGED OR

04:45:45.428 --> 04:45:47.029
DESTROYED PARKS. FOR EXAMPLE,

04:45:47.096 --> 04:45:48.498
WITH THE DEVASTATION OF THE TOWN

04:45:48.564 --> 04:45:50.366
OF PARADISE AND THE LENGTHY TIME

04:45:50.433 --> 04:45:52.535
FRAME IT TOOK FOR MANY PARKS TO

04:45:52.602 --> 04:45:53.069
START REBUILDING, IT WAS

04:45:53.135 --> 04:45:54.337
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR

04:45:54.403 --> 04:45:56.005
HOMEOWNERS TO KNOW THE STATUS OF

04:45:56.072 --> 04:45:58.274
THE PARKS. PLANS TO REBUILD OR

04:45:58.341 --> 04:45:59.809
CLOSE. HOMEOWNERS WOULD ONLY

04:45:59.876 --> 04:46:01.143
KNOW THE STATUS IF THE OWNER WAS

04:46:01.210 --> 04:46:02.612
WILLING TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEM

04:46:02.678 --> 04:46:04.413
AND PROVIDE THEM INFORMATION.

04:46:04.480 --> 04:46:06.249
HAD THIS BILL EXISTED,

04:46:06.315 --> 04:46:08.084
HOMEOWNERS AND THE PUBLIC

04:46:08.150 --> 04:46:09.051
ENTITIES WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER

04:46:09.118 --> 04:46:11.287
ABLE TO MONITOR WHICH PARKS PLAN

04:46:11.354 --> 04:46:13.322
TO REOPEN, CHANGE, USE, OR CLOSE

04:46:13.389 --> 04:46:15.258
COMPLETELY, AND WITH THE NOTICE

04:46:15.324 --> 04:46:15.825
REQUIREMENTS, WOULD HAVE HAD

04:46:15.892 --> 04:46:18.060
TIME TO MAKE A PLAN TO PRESERVE

04:46:18.127 --> 04:46:19.529
AT LEAST SOME OF THOSE PARKS

04:46:19.595 --> 04:46:21.631
THAT DID END UP CLOSING. OUR

04:46:21.697 --> 04:46:23.232
FIRM HAS ALSO REPRESENTED

04:46:23.299 --> 04:46:24.600
TENANTS WHO LIVE IN AFFORDABLE

04:46:24.667 --> 04:46:26.135

NOTICE LAW. THE NOTICE

04:46:29.238 --> 04:46:29.972
REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN

04:46:30.039 --> 04:46:31.374
INSTRUMENTAL IN PRESERVING THE

04:46:31.440 --> 04:46:32.775
AFFORDABILITY OF APARTMENT

04:46:32.842 --> 04:46:35.077
COMPLEXES IN SEVERAL INSTANCES,

04:46:35.144 --> 04:46:35.945
EXTENDING THIS TYPE OF NOTICE

04:46:36.012 --> 04:46:37.613
PERIOD AND PROTECTION TO MOBILE

04:46:37.680 --> 04:46:39.282
HOME OWNERS IS A LOGICAL NEXT

04:46:39.348 --> 04:46:41.817
STEP. MOBILE HOME PARKS ARE

04:46:41.884 --> 04:46:43.119
COMMUNITIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS,

04:46:43.185 --> 04:46:44.720
AND THE CLOSURE OF THE PARKS

04:46:44.787 --> 04:46:46.088
DESTROYS THESE COMMUNITIES.

04:46:46.155 --> 04:46:47.757
FURTHER, PEOPLE LIVING IN MOBILE

04:46:47.823 --> 04:46:49.325
HOME PARKS ARE UNIQUELY SITUATED

04:46:49.392 --> 04:46:53.796
AS BOTH HOMEOWNERS AND TENANTS

04:46:53.863 --> 04:46:54.463
IN THE PARK, WHERE THEY RENT THE

04:46:54.530 --> 04:46:55.097
SPACE THEIR HOME SITS ON. THE

04:46:55.164 --> 04:46:56.899
LOSS OF THE ENTIRE PARK RENDERS

04:46:56.966 --> 04:46:59.902
THEIR INVESTMENT IN EQUITY

04:46:59.969 --> 04:47:01.070
WORTHLESS, AS THE VALUE OF THE

04:47:01.137 --> 04:47:02.505
HOME IS ONLY REALIZED IF THE

04:47:02.572 --> 04:47:04.574
HOMEOWNER HAS A PLACE TO BE. FOR

04:47:04.640 --> 04:47:06.409

04:47:58.995 --> 04:48:01.097
A MOBILE HOME PARK ATTORNEY FOR

04:48:01.163 --> 04:48:02.932
NEARLY 20 YEARS NOW. I'M HERE ON

04:48:02.999 --> 04:48:05.401
BEHALF OF RMA AND I ALSO

04:48:05.468 --> 04:48:06.535
REPRESENT TAHITIAN TERRACE

04:48:06.602 --> 04:48:08.437
MOBILE HOME PARK IN PACIFIC

04:48:08.504 --> 04:48:09.972
PALISADES, WHICH WAS COMPLETELY

04:48:10.039 --> 04:48:11.907
DESTROYED IN THE JANUARY FIRES.

04:48:11.974 --> 04:48:13.609
I WILL NOTE THAT IF SECTION

04:48:13.676 --> 04:48:16.078
THREE, WHICH IS THE PART THAT

04:48:16.145 --> 04:48:17.980
MANDATES THAT MY CLIENT OR ANY

04:48:18.047 --> 04:48:20.516
PARK OWNER SELL THE PARK, IS

04:48:20.583 --> 04:48:22.251
REMOVED FROM THIS BILL BY WAY OF

04:48:22.318 --> 04:48:24.587
AMENDMENT, RMA WOULD GO NEUTRAL.

04:48:24.654 --> 04:48:26.656
IN THE MEANTIME. AS TO SECTION

04:48:26.722 --> 04:48:28.791
THREE, THE PNL SHOULD NOT EXTEND

04:48:28.858 --> 04:48:30.292
TO MOBILE HOME PARKS FOR THREE

04:48:30.359 --> 04:48:32.028
REASONS ONE, A DEVELOPER TOOK

04:48:32.094 --> 04:48:33.529
THE SUBSIDY WITH THE

04:48:33.596 --> 04:48:34.430
UNDERSTANDING OF THE REQUIREMENT

04:48:34.497 --> 04:48:36.432
TO SELL TO A QUALIFIED ENTITY.

04:48:36.499 --> 04:48:38.601
WHEN THE CONTRACT EXPIRED, PARK

04:48:38.668 --> 04:48:40.636
OWNERS RECEIVED NO SUCH SUBSIDY

04:48:40.703 --> 04:48:42.738
AND MADE NO SUCH AGREEMENT. TWO

04:48:42.805 --> 04:48:44.273
IT WOULD NOT NECESSARILY

04:48:44.340 --> 04:48:46.042
MAXIMIZE OR INCREASE THE NUMBER

04:48:46.108 --> 04:48:47.810
OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS TO

04:48:47.877 --> 04:48:51.247
TERRACE, FOR EXAMPLE, HAS 156

04:48:51.313 --> 04:48:52.148
SPACES, BUT THE LAND COULD

04:48:52.214 --> 04:48:54.383
PROBABLY ACCOMMODATE 300

04:48:54.450 --> 04:48:56.285
AFFORDABLE APARTMENTS AND CONDO

04:48:56.352 --> 04:48:57.253
UNITS. AND THEN FINALLY THREE.

04:48:57.319 --> 04:48:59.088
THE PARK OWNER WILL LIKELY NOT

04:48:59.155 --> 04:49:01.390
RECEIVE FAIR MARKET VALUE FOR

04:49:01.457 --> 04:49:02.258
THEIR PROPERTY. WHAT IS

04:49:02.324 --> 04:49:03.726
ENVISIONED IN THIS IS THAT,

04:49:03.793 --> 04:49:05.461
LET'S SAY, HYPOTHETICALLY, THE

04:49:05.528 --> 04:49:06.996
PARK OWNER WANTS TO SELL HIS

04:49:07.063 --> 04:49:09.632
LAND WITH HIS APPRAISER FOR 50

04:49:09.699 --> 04:49:11.667
MILLION. THE BUYER WOULD HAVE AN

04:49:11.734 --> 04:49:13.969
APPRAISER THAT WOULD SAY 10

04:49:14.036 --> 04:49:15.371
MILLION. AND THEN THE LAW SAYS

04:49:15.438 --> 04:49:16.672
THERE'LL BE A THIRD APPRAISER

04:49:16.739 --> 04:49:18.774
THAT WILL SPLIT THE BABY,

04:49:18.841 --> 04:49:19.942
FORCING THE PARK OWNER TO SELL

04:49:20.009 --> 04:49:21.744
THEIR PARK, LET'S SAY, AT 30

04:49:21.811 --> 04:49:24.213
MILLION, AT A HUGE LOSS. BEYOND

04:49:24.280 --> 04:49:26.515
THESE THREE REASONS, EXTENDING

04:49:26.582 --> 04:49:27.883
PNL WOULD VIOLATE THE PARK

04:49:27.950 --> 04:49:29.351
OWNER'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO

04:49:29.418 --> 04:49:32.221
CLOSE A PARK. AS STAFF NOTES, A

04:49:32.288 --> 04:49:33.556
REGULATORY TAKING IS DETERMINED

04:49:33.622 --> 04:49:35.391
BY WHETHER THE LAW INTERFERES

04:49:35.458 --> 04:49:38.127
WITH DISTINCT INVESTMENT BACKED

04:49:38.194 --> 04:49:39.762
EXPECTATIONS FOR THE. FOR THE

04:49:39.829 --> 04:49:41.864
PAST 3 OR 4 DECADES, EVERY PARK

04:49:41.931 --> 04:49:43.632
OWNER HAS AN EXPECTATION,

04:49:43.699 --> 04:49:44.967
SUPPORTED BY CALIFORNIA LAW,

04:49:45.034 --> 04:49:46.969
THAT THEY CAN CLOSE THE PARK. WE

04:49:47.036 --> 04:49:50.072
HAVE MRL PROVISIONS THAT ALLOW A

04:49:50.139 --> 04:49:52.408
PARK OWNER TO CLOSE THE PARK, SO

04:49:52.475 --> 04:49:55.044
FOR 40 YEARS WE HAVE SUPPORTED

04:49:55.111 --> 04:49:56.946
THAT EXPECTATION. TO TAKE AWAY

04:49:57.012 --> 04:49:59.315
THAT EXPECTATION IS WHAT WOULD

04:49:59.381 --> 04:50:01.250
MAKE IT A REGULATORY TAKING.

04:50:01.317 --> 04:50:04.286
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

04:50:04.353 --> 04:50:05.921
MEMBERS. JASON, ON BEHALF OF THE

04:50:05.988 --> 04:50:06.989
CALIFORNIA MOBILE HOME PARK

04:50:07.056 --> 04:50:08.891
OWNERS ALLIANCE, I WILL DO MY

04:50:08.958 --> 04:50:10.693
BEST TO NOT REPEAT EVERYTHING

04:50:10.760 --> 04:50:12.628
THAT MY COLLEAGUE SAID. STARTING

04:50:12.695 --> 04:50:14.396
AT THE TOP. WE AGREE WITH HIS

04:50:14.463 --> 04:50:15.798
ASSESSMENT ON THE

04:50:15.865 --> 04:50:16.532
CONSTITUTIONALITY.

04:50:16.599 --> 04:50:17.900
FUNDAMENTALLY, WE BELIEVE THAT

04:50:17.967 --> 04:50:19.535
THE BILL DEPRIVES A PARK OWNER

04:50:19.602 --> 04:50:22.638
OF THE FULL MARKET VALUE. AND

04:50:22.705 --> 04:50:23.973
BUT BUT MORE FUNDAMENTALLY,

04:50:24.039 --> 04:50:26.041
BECAUSE OF ITS ITS ITS

04:50:26.108 --> 04:50:27.943
UNCONSTITUTIONALITY, WE QUESTION

04:50:28.010 --> 04:50:29.578
SERIOUSLY WHETHER THE BILL WILL

04:50:29.645 --> 04:50:31.080
ACHIEVE THE AUTHOR'S SINCERE AND

04:50:31.147 --> 04:50:32.281
STATED INTENT OF PRESERVING

04:50:32.348 --> 04:50:34.784
MOBILE HOME PARKS. WE THINK THAT

04:50:34.850 --> 04:50:36.619
IT WILL BE ESSENTIAL THAT PARK

04:50:36.685 --> 04:50:38.621
OWNERS TO PROTECT THEIR PROPERTY

04:50:38.687 --> 04:50:39.755
VALUE, JUST LIKE ANY OTHER

04:50:39.822 --> 04:50:41.157
PROPERTY OWNER IN THE STATE

04:50:41.223 --> 04:50:43.526
WOULD WHEN THEY WERE FACING A

04:50:43.592 --> 04:50:44.393
SITUATION WHERE THEY WERE GOING

04:50:44.460 --> 04:50:45.628
TO BE TOLD THAT THEY ARE BOUND

04:50:45.694 --> 04:50:47.630
BY A PRICE SET BY AN APPRAISER,

04:50:47.696 --> 04:50:49.331
THEY ARE GOING TO BE FORCED TO

04:50:49.398 --> 04:50:50.599
LITIGATE THIS ISSUE. THAT WILL

04:50:50.666 --> 04:50:52.234
TAKE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF

04:50:52.301 --> 04:50:53.803
YEARS, IN OUR OPINION, JUST

04:50:53.869 --> 04:50:55.571
LOOKING AT WHAT THE COURT'S

04:50:55.638 --> 04:50:57.973
CURRENT CASELOAD IS TODAY. AND

04:50:58.040 --> 04:50:59.708
SO AS A CONSEQUENCE, WE DON'T

04:50:59.775 --> 04:51:00.910
THINK IT'S GOING TO ACHIEVE THE

04:51:00.976 --> 04:51:01.944
GOAL OF PRESERVING MOBILE HOME

04:51:02.011 --> 04:51:04.380
PARK HOUSING OR GETTING A PARK

04:51:04.446 --> 04:51:06.081
REBUILT FASTER. I ALSO JUST WANT

04:51:06.148 --> 04:51:07.316
TO BRIEFLY ADDRESS, YOU KNOW,

04:51:07.383 --> 04:51:08.751
THE NOTION THAT THIS IS

04:51:08.818 --> 04:51:09.819
APPLICATION OF PRESERVATION

04:51:09.885 --> 04:51:11.453
NOTICE LAW ON MOBILE HOME PARKS.

04:51:11.520 --> 04:51:12.588
SO SOME IMPORTANT THINGS ARE

04:51:12.655 --> 04:51:15.124
SAID BOTH IN THE ANALYSIS AND TO

04:51:15.191 --> 04:51:16.225
SOME EXTENT ACKNOWLEDGED HERE BY

04:51:16.292 --> 04:51:18.861
THE AUTHOR. WE HAVE SAID FOR THE

04:51:18.928 --> 04:51:20.229
LAST SEVERAL DECADES THAT MOBILE

04:51:20.296 --> 04:51:22.064
HOME PARKS ARE THE LARGEST FORM

04:51:22.131 --> 04:51:23.032
OF UNSUBSIDIZED AFFORDABLE

04:51:23.098 --> 04:51:25.234
HOUSING PRESERVATION. NOTICE LAW

04:51:25.301 --> 04:51:26.969
APPLIES TO SUBSIDIZED AFFORDABLE

04:51:27.036 --> 04:51:28.804
HOUSING. IT'S AN ONEROUS SET OF

04:51:28.871 --> 04:51:30.139
REQUIREMENTS TO ANY PROPERTY

04:51:30.206 --> 04:51:32.474
OWNER, BUT IT'S APPROPRIATE

04:51:32.541 --> 04:51:33.509
BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT, EITHER

04:51:33.576 --> 04:51:35.211
THROUGH STATE, LOCAL OR FEDERAL

04:51:35.277 --> 04:51:35.978
GOVERNMENT, HAS SKIN IN THE

04:51:36.045 --> 04:51:37.713
GAME. THEY DON'T JUST HAVE

04:51:37.780 --> 04:51:38.714
INTEREST IN PRESERVING THE

04:51:38.781 --> 04:51:39.815
HOUSING, THEY HAVE PAID MONEY TO

04:51:39.882 --> 04:51:41.517
PRESERVE THE HOUSING. THAT IS

04:51:41.584 --> 04:51:42.918
NOT THE CASE FOR THESE MOBILE

04:51:42.985 --> 04:51:44.653
HOME PARKS THAT WE REPRESENT

04:51:44.720 --> 04:51:46.722
HERE. AND SO WE WOULD BE

04:51:46.789 --> 04:51:47.323
APPLYING THAT FRAMEWORK AFTER

04:51:47.389 --> 04:51:48.791
THE FACT TO PARK OWNERS WHO HAVE

04:51:48.858 --> 04:51:50.759
BEEN OPERATING IN GOOD FAITH

04:51:50.826 --> 04:51:52.228
AFFORDABLY FOR DECADES. SO FOR

04:51:52.294 --> 04:51:52.728
THESE REASONS, WE MUST

04:51:52.795 --> 04:51:53.596
RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL AND

04:51:53.662 --> 04:51:55.798
REQUEST YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU.

04:51:55.865 --> 04:51:59.068
IS THERE ANYONE ELSE HERE IN

04:51:59.134 --> 04:52:00.669
OPPOSITION? STATE YOUR NAME,

04:52:00.736 --> 04:52:03.505
ENTITY AND POSITION. HI, MADAM

04:52:03.572 --> 04:52:05.574
CHAIR CHRIS, VICE MAYOR, AND I'M

04:52:05.641 --> 04:52:07.343
HERE TO ACTUALLY JUST ANSWER ANY

04:52:07.409 --> 04:52:08.644
QUESTIONS ON BEHALF OF THE

04:52:08.711 --> 04:52:10.279
ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU, THANK

04:52:10.346 --> 04:52:11.780
YOU. I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND

04:52:11.847 --> 04:52:13.983
BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE.

04:52:14.049 --> 04:52:17.019
IS THERE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS?

04:52:17.086 --> 04:52:18.921
ASSEMBLY MEMBER HARBIN THANK

04:52:18.988 --> 04:52:20.689
YOU, MADAM CHAIR. AND THANK YOU

04:52:20.756 --> 04:52:22.424
TO THE AUTHOR FOR OBVIOUSLY

04:52:22.491 --> 04:52:23.893
FIGHTING FOR HIS CONSTITUENTS. I

04:52:23.959 --> 04:52:25.761
JUST WANT TO SAY, SIR, SO SORRY

04:52:25.828 --> 04:52:27.463
FOR YOUR LOSS AND EVERYTHING

04:52:27.529 --> 04:52:29.231
THAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH. AND

04:52:29.298 --> 04:52:30.633
OBVIOUSLY WORST CASE SCENARIO, I

04:52:30.699 --> 04:52:32.234
MEAN, IT COULD BE WORSE. YOU'RE

04:52:32.301 --> 04:52:34.670
HERE AND YOU'RE ALIVE, BUT LET'S

04:52:34.737 --> 04:52:37.539
NOT THIS BILL ASIDE, LET THE

04:52:37.606 --> 04:52:39.642
MOMENT KIND OF ESCAPE US OF JUST

04:52:39.708 --> 04:52:42.645
WE ALL HAVE AN EXTREME AMOUNT OF

04:52:42.711 --> 04:52:43.779
SYMPATHY AND EMPATHY, AND OUR

04:52:43.846 --> 04:52:45.547
HEART GOES OUT TO YOU EVERY DAY.

04:52:45.614 --> 04:52:47.049
AND WE KNOW THAT YOUR SENATOR

04:52:47.116 --> 04:52:50.185
HERE IS JUST TRYING TO KIND OF

04:52:50.252 --> 04:52:51.987
FIGHT FOR YOUR EXISTENCE. AND WE

04:52:52.054 --> 04:52:53.923
APPRECIATE THAT. SO THANK YOU TO

04:52:53.989 --> 04:52:54.890
THE SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS.

04:52:54.957 --> 04:52:56.425
WE'VE HAD GOOD CONVERSATIONS. I,

04:52:56.492 --> 04:52:59.595
I AM SYMPATHETIC ON THE

04:52:59.662 --> 04:53:00.996
PURCHASING ASPECT OF THIS BILL.

04:53:01.063 --> 04:53:03.232
I THINK THE NOTICE ASPECTS OF

04:53:03.299 --> 04:53:06.468
THIS BILL MAKE SENSE. AND I

04:53:06.535 --> 04:53:08.370
THINK TO THE EXTENT THAT A

04:53:08.437 --> 04:53:10.773
MOBILE HOME OWNER IS CONVERTING

04:53:10.839 --> 04:53:12.107
THEIR PROPERTY TO SOMETHING

04:53:12.174 --> 04:53:13.342
OTHER THAN MOBILE HOMES, THERE

04:53:13.409 --> 04:53:15.811
SHOULD BE ADEQUATE NOTICE. AND

04:53:15.878 --> 04:53:16.779
ARGUABLY THERE ALREADY IS. BUT

04:53:16.845 --> 04:53:18.747
IF WE WANT TO BOLSTER THAT FOR

04:53:18.814 --> 04:53:20.382
THE CONSUMER, I THINK THAT

04:53:20.449 --> 04:53:22.251
THAT'S GREAT. I DO THINK THAT

04:53:22.318 --> 04:53:23.519
FOR THE MANDATORY PURCHASE

04:53:23.585 --> 04:53:25.554
OPTION, REALLY WHAT WE'RE

04:53:25.621 --> 04:53:27.556
DEBATING HERE IS ONE IS P AND L

04:53:27.623 --> 04:53:29.158
ACTUALLY APPLICABLE. AND I THINK

04:53:29.224 --> 04:53:30.359
THAT THE OPPOSITION MAKES SOME

04:53:30.426 --> 04:53:31.627
GOOD ARGUMENTS AS TO WHY IT'S

04:53:31.694 --> 04:53:33.362
NOT TWO. I THINK IT'S

04:53:33.429 --> 04:53:34.029
FUNDAMENTALLY PRICE. YOU KNOW, I

04:53:34.096 --> 04:53:35.631
DO THINK IT'S I DON'T THINK

04:53:35.698 --> 04:53:38.033
ANYONE WOULD ARGUE THAT THE, THE

04:53:38.100 --> 04:53:39.535
OWNERS WITHIN THE PARK HAVE THE

04:53:39.601 --> 04:53:41.036
OPTION TO PUT TOGETHER A BONA

04:53:41.103 --> 04:53:43.839
FIDE OFFER AT A CERTAIN PRICE,

04:53:43.906 --> 04:53:46.075
AND THAT THE SELLER SHOULD HAVE

04:53:46.141 --> 04:53:48.077
THE OPTION TO SELL IT TO THEM,

04:53:48.143 --> 04:53:49.545
TO THEM, IF, IF THEY WANT. I

04:53:49.611 --> 04:53:51.080
THINK WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH

04:53:51.146 --> 04:53:53.682
HERE IS THE IDEA THAT WE WILL

04:53:53.749 --> 04:53:55.250
MANDATE A PURCHASE TO A CERTAIN

04:53:55.317 --> 04:53:58.120
BUYER, THE CURRENT TENANTS, AT A

04:53:58.187 --> 04:53:59.621
CERTAIN PRICE DICTATED BY A

04:53:59.688 --> 04:54:02.091
THIRD PARTY. AND I DO THINK THAT

04:54:02.157 --> 04:54:04.460
IS A TROUBLING NOTION FOR A LOT

04:54:04.526 --> 04:54:06.795
OF REASONS. ONE OF WHICH IS I

04:54:06.862 --> 04:54:08.263
THINK IT COULD LEAD TO SCENARIOS

04:54:08.330 --> 04:54:10.366
WHERE SOMEONE WHO OWNS A RENTAL

04:54:10.432 --> 04:54:12.201
BUILDING, MULTI-UNIT RENTAL

04:54:12.267 --> 04:54:14.703
BUILDING, WHO WOULD WANT TO SELL

04:54:14.770 --> 04:54:16.271
THE BUILDING AND, AND OR CONVERT

04:54:16.338 --> 04:54:17.873
IT TO CONDOS OR DO SOMETHING

04:54:17.940 --> 04:54:19.742
ELSE. YOU COULD SEE THIS LAW

04:54:19.808 --> 04:54:22.244
APPLYING TO THAT SCENARIO WHERE

04:54:22.311 --> 04:54:24.146
THE STATE WOULD POTENTIALLY

04:54:24.213 --> 04:54:25.681
FORCE THEM TO ACTUALLY SELL IT

04:54:25.748 --> 04:54:28.183
TO THE TENANTS IN SOME SORT OF

04:54:28.250 --> 04:54:29.718
CO-OP, AND AT A PRICE THAT WAS

04:54:29.785 --> 04:54:30.986
DICTATED NOT BY THE MARKET, BUT

04:54:31.053 --> 04:54:33.555
BUT BY THE STATUTE. AND I JUST

04:54:33.622 --> 04:54:36.525
THINK THAT THE POTENTIAL TO

04:54:36.592 --> 04:54:39.228
ABUSE THIS, EVEN IF IT IS

04:54:39.294 --> 04:54:41.430
CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL, IS

04:54:41.497 --> 04:54:43.198
REALLY SOMETHING THAT MAKES ME

04:54:43.265 --> 04:54:44.433
UNCOMFORTABLE. THAT BEING SAID,

04:54:44.500 --> 04:54:46.835
I UNDERSTAND THAT THE PURPOSE OF

04:54:46.902 --> 04:54:50.706
THIS IS REALLY TO TRY TO ADDRESS

04:54:50.773 --> 04:54:52.508
WILDFIRE VICTIMS, DISASTER

04:54:52.574 --> 04:54:55.477
VICTIMS WHO HAVE BEEN PUT IN A

04:54:55.544 --> 04:54:57.112
SITUATION WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN

04:54:57.179 --> 04:54:58.213
LEFT WITH NOTHING, EITHER

04:54:58.280 --> 04:54:59.548
THEY'RE UNINSURED OR

04:54:59.615 --> 04:55:00.149
UNDERINSURED, THEY DON'T HAVE

04:55:00.215 --> 04:55:01.583
THE MOBILE HOME, THEY DON'T OWN

04:55:01.650 --> 04:55:03.719
THE DIRT. AND I AM SYMPATHETIC

04:55:03.786 --> 04:55:06.955
TO THAT. SO MY QUESTION IS, IS

04:55:07.022 --> 04:55:10.626
THIS A BILL THAT COULD

04:55:10.692 --> 04:55:12.327
POTENTIALLY BE NARROWED TO ONLY

04:55:12.394 --> 04:55:15.230
DISASTERS AND OR, YOU KNOW,

04:55:15.297 --> 04:55:16.732
WILDFIRES? I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF

04:55:16.799 --> 04:55:18.100
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE

04:55:18.167 --> 04:55:20.035
OPPOSITION WOULD ENTERTAIN FOR

04:55:20.102 --> 04:55:21.637
ALL THE SAME REASONS THAT

04:55:21.703 --> 04:55:23.205
THEY'VE THAT THEY HAVE

04:55:23.272 --> 04:55:24.139
ARTICULATED. BUT IT IS SOMETHING

04:55:24.206 --> 04:55:25.707
THAT IS INTERESTING TO ME

04:55:25.774 --> 04:55:27.576
BECAUSE I DO THINK IF WE'RE JUST

04:55:27.643 --> 04:55:28.944
GOING TO SAY STATEWIDE, EVERY

04:55:29.011 --> 04:55:30.112
MOBILE HOME PARK OWNER NEEDS TO

04:55:30.179 --> 04:55:33.982
ADHERE TO THIS COMPLETELY NEW,

04:55:34.049 --> 04:55:35.217
COMPLETELY NEW FRAMEWORK THAT

04:55:35.284 --> 04:55:37.619
YOU KNOW THAT YOU'VE LAID OUT IN

04:55:37.686 --> 04:55:39.955
THE BILL. I DO THINK THAT THAT

04:55:40.022 --> 04:55:40.856
IS IT'S A PRETTY DRASTIC STEP.

04:55:40.923 --> 04:55:42.624
SO I GUESS LET ME JUST THE

04:55:42.691 --> 04:55:44.660
QUESTION IN A LONG WIND UP IS,

04:55:44.726 --> 04:55:46.195
WOULD YOU EVER CONSIDER

04:55:46.261 --> 04:55:46.795
NARROWING IT JUST TO EITHER

04:55:46.862 --> 04:55:47.930
WILDFIRE VICTIMS, DISASTER

04:55:47.996 --> 04:55:51.033
VICTIMS FOR PURPOSES OF THE OF

04:55:51.100 --> 04:55:54.303
THE BILL? YEAH, I WOULD CONSIDER

04:55:54.369 --> 04:55:57.072
THAT. I MEAN, ULTIMATELY THIS

04:55:57.139 --> 04:55:58.707
THIS BILL IS VERY MUCH INSPIRED

04:55:58.774 --> 04:56:01.710
BY THE EXAMPLE OF MY

04:56:01.777 --> 04:56:03.045
CONSTITUENTS WHO LOST THEIR

04:56:03.112 --> 04:56:04.646
HOMES. I MEAN, THERE'S A REASON

04:56:04.713 --> 04:56:07.249
WHY WE WROTE IT THIS WAY, BUT I

04:56:07.316 --> 04:56:08.350
THINK IT WOULD BE MEANINGFUL TO,

04:56:08.417 --> 04:56:09.751
TO MEMBERS TO LIMIT TO THOSE

04:56:09.818 --> 04:56:10.652
CASES. I'M CERTAINLY OPEN TO

04:56:10.719 --> 04:56:12.988
CONSIDERING THAT. ABSOLUTELY. I

04:56:13.055 --> 04:56:14.756
APPRECIATE THAT. AND I GUESS TO

04:56:14.823 --> 04:56:15.958
ANYONE HERE THAT CAN ANSWER WHAT

04:56:16.024 --> 04:56:18.060
WHAT WOULD THIS PURCHASE LOOK

04:56:18.127 --> 04:56:19.995
LIKE? SO IF THE MOBILE HOME

04:56:20.062 --> 04:56:21.964
TENANT OWNERS COME TOGETHER AS A

04:56:22.030 --> 04:56:22.831
COALITION, THEY TRY TO COME UP

04:56:22.898 --> 04:56:24.566
WITH FINANCING AND THEY PUT IN A

04:56:24.633 --> 04:56:26.735
BONA FIDE OFFER LIKE, IS THIS

04:56:26.802 --> 04:56:28.203
SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN DONE?

04:56:28.270 --> 04:56:28.971
BECAUSE EFFECTIVELY THIS THIS

04:56:29.037 --> 04:56:31.940
BILL WOULD, WOULD PROVIDE THAT

04:56:32.007 --> 04:56:33.709
OPTION, RIGHT. OR AND AGAIN,

04:56:33.775 --> 04:56:35.577
IT'S THE IT'S THE MÀ VERSUS THE

04:56:35.644 --> 04:56:37.146
CHAU THAT I GET THAT GIVES ME

04:56:37.212 --> 04:56:38.881
SOME TROUBLE IF IT'S A MAY AND

04:56:38.947 --> 04:56:40.649
IT'S JUST A VOLUNTARY THEN THEN

04:56:40.716 --> 04:56:42.751
THAT'S FINE. BUT I JUST WANT TO

04:56:42.818 --> 04:56:44.620
KNOW THE MECHANICS OF HOW THIS

04:56:44.686 --> 04:56:45.621
WOULD WORK. WHOEVER CAN ANSWER

04:56:45.687 --> 04:56:47.756
THAT, I JUST DON'T I DON'T KNOW

04:56:47.823 --> 04:56:48.357
HOW IT WOULD ACTUALLY WORK.

04:56:48.423 --> 04:56:50.392
YEAH. IT'S A IT'S A THE PROCESS

04:56:50.459 --> 04:56:51.727
THAT WAS ESTABLISHED. AND BY THE

04:56:51.793 --> 04:56:54.263
WAY, I'M OPEN TO DIFFERENT. YOU

04:56:54.329 --> 04:56:56.498
KNOW, IF THERE'S IF THERE'S IT'S

04:56:56.565 --> 04:56:58.233
MY UNDERSTANDING FROM EXTENSIVE

04:56:58.300 --> 04:56:58.901
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

04:56:58.967 --> 04:57:01.036
OPPOSITION THAT THEY I THINK

04:57:01.103 --> 04:57:03.238
ULTIMATELY JUST WANT THEY, THEY

04:57:03.305 --> 04:57:06.508
DON'T WANT TO THEY, YOU KNOW,

04:57:06.575 --> 04:57:08.510
THEY WANT A FREE MARKET SALE TO

04:57:08.577 --> 04:57:10.579
WHOEVER THEY WANT TO SELL TO. SO

04:57:10.646 --> 04:57:12.681
THEY SORT OF OBJECT TO, TO

04:57:12.748 --> 04:57:14.816
ANYTHING IN THIS SPACE. WHAT

04:57:14.883 --> 04:57:16.618
WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS IF YOU BUY

04:57:16.685 --> 04:57:18.353
THE PREMISE THAT THE RESIDENTS

04:57:18.420 --> 04:57:20.589
OUGHT TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO COME

04:57:20.656 --> 04:57:23.692
TOGETHER AND KIND OF BE GIVEN A

04:57:23.759 --> 04:57:26.195
KIND OF A FIRST, FIRST OFFER OF

04:57:26.261 --> 04:57:28.497
REFUSAL, KIND OF FIRST REFUSAL

04:57:28.564 --> 04:57:29.865
TYPE SITUATION, THEN THE

04:57:29.932 --> 04:57:31.200
QUESTION IS, WELL, HOW DO YOU

04:57:31.266 --> 04:57:33.135
CREATE A SCENARIO WHERE YOU CAN

04:57:33.202 --> 04:57:34.937
GET A GOOD, FAIR MARKET VALUE

04:57:35.003 --> 04:57:37.105
FOR THE PARK? AND THAT'S THROUGH

04:57:37.172 --> 04:57:37.940
APPRAISERS, APPRAISERS. THAT'S

04:57:38.006 --> 04:57:39.541
WHAT THEY DO PROFESSIONALLY.

04:57:39.608 --> 04:57:41.343
THEY THEY APPRAISE THE VALUE OF

04:57:41.410 --> 04:57:42.511
PROPERTIES. WE SET UP A

04:57:42.578 --> 04:57:43.745
STRUCTURE WHERE BOTH SIDES CAN

04:57:43.812 --> 04:57:46.148
COME, CAN HIRE APPRAISERS IF

04:57:46.215 --> 04:57:47.549
THEY'RE RELATIVELY CLOSE, IF

04:57:47.616 --> 04:57:49.551
THEY'RE WITHIN 5% OF THE SAME

04:57:49.618 --> 04:57:52.554
VALUE, THEN, YOU KNOW, THEN IT

04:57:52.621 --> 04:57:54.122
ACTUALLY ENDS UP GOING WITH THE

04:57:54.189 --> 04:57:55.757
HIGHER VALUE. IF THERE'S A MAJOR

04:57:55.824 --> 04:57:56.858
DISCREPANCY, THEN THE PARTIES

04:57:56.925 --> 04:57:59.394
CAN GET A THIRD. THEY WILL AGREE

04:57:59.461 --> 04:58:00.963
TOGETHER ON A THIRD, THIRD,

04:58:01.029 --> 04:58:03.198
THIRD APPRAISAL TO HELP TO

04:58:03.265 --> 04:58:04.032
DETERMINE THE VALUE. THIS IS

04:58:04.099 --> 04:58:05.701
WHAT APPRAISERS DO. I MEAN, THIS

04:58:05.767 --> 04:58:07.769
IS WHY, YOU KNOW, IF YOU IF YOU

04:58:07.836 --> 04:58:09.871
BUY A HOME, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU'VE

04:58:09.938 --> 04:58:10.872
GOT TO GO GET APPRAISAL. THE

04:58:10.939 --> 04:58:12.241
BANK WILL GET AN APPRAISAL TO

04:58:12.307 --> 04:58:13.508
JUST MAKE SURE THAT THE LOAN

04:58:13.575 --> 04:58:15.244
THAT THEY'RE GIVING YOU IS NOT

04:58:15.310 --> 04:58:16.778
OUT OF WHACK WITH THE PURCHASE

04:58:16.845 --> 04:58:18.347
PRICE THAT YOU'RE, THAT YOU'RE

04:58:18.413 --> 04:58:19.615
PUTTING UP FOR THE HOUSE. THIS

04:58:19.681 --> 04:58:21.650
IS OUR SYSTEM. APPRAISERS ARE

04:58:21.717 --> 04:58:23.452
THERE TO HELP DETERMINE THE FAIR

04:58:23.518 --> 04:58:25.387
MARKET VALUE OF PROPERTIES. AND

04:58:25.454 --> 04:58:27.923
SO AGAIN, IF FOLKS WANT TO

04:58:27.990 --> 04:58:30.826
SUGGEST A DIFFERENT WAY OF

04:58:30.892 --> 04:58:31.827
APPRAISING THE VALUE TO MAKE

04:58:31.893 --> 04:58:33.562
SURE THAT THOSE, YOU KNOW, THE

04:58:33.629 --> 04:58:35.097
OWNERS ARE WHOLE, I'M OPEN TO

04:58:35.163 --> 04:58:36.965
THAT CONVERSATION. WE THOUGHT

04:58:37.032 --> 04:58:39.668
THIS WAS A FAIR WAY OF DOING IT.

04:58:39.735 --> 04:58:41.837
BUT YEAH, YOU KNOW, THIS IS

04:58:41.903 --> 04:58:42.938
ULTIMATELY ABOUT MAKING SURE

04:58:43.005 --> 04:58:44.306
THAT, YOU KNOW, THAT THE OWNERS

04:58:44.373 --> 04:58:47.342
ARE ABLE TO GET A FAIR MARKET

04:58:47.409 --> 04:58:48.677
COMPENSATION FOR THE SALE. AND

04:58:48.744 --> 04:58:51.947
REMEMBER, THIS ONLY HAPPENS IF,

04:58:52.014 --> 04:58:53.048
YOU KNOW, IF THESE FOLKS ARE

04:58:53.115 --> 04:58:54.983
ABLE TO COME UP WITH THE MONEY

04:58:55.050 --> 04:58:56.752
WITH, WITH A REAL BONAFIDE OFFER

04:58:56.818 --> 04:58:58.654
THAT'S FINANCED AND READY TO GO,

04:58:58.720 --> 04:59:00.322
THAT MEETS THE FAIR MARKET VALUE

04:59:00.389 --> 04:59:03.725
OF THE PARK. YEAH. AND I

04:59:03.792 --> 04:59:04.893
APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU. BUT

04:59:04.960 --> 04:59:06.728
IS IT THE FAIR MARKET? I THINK

04:59:06.795 --> 04:59:07.929
WHERE THE TENSION IS, IS THAT

04:59:07.996 --> 04:59:11.667
THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE

04:59:11.733 --> 04:59:12.434
OWNER TRANSFORMING THE MOBILE

04:59:12.501 --> 04:59:15.604
HOME PARK INTO A 500 UNIT CONDO

04:59:15.671 --> 04:59:17.339
PROPERTY, OR IS IT THE FAIR

04:59:17.406 --> 04:59:19.308
MARKET VALUE OF EXISTING

04:59:19.374 --> 04:59:20.776
REMAINING AS AN EXISTING MOBILE

04:59:20.842 --> 04:59:22.544
HOME PARK? BECAUSE THOSE ARE

04:59:22.611 --> 04:59:23.278
GOING TO BE WILDLY DIFFERENT.

04:59:23.345 --> 04:59:25.047
THE TERMS, THE TERMS THAT WERE

04:59:25.113 --> 04:59:26.715
USED WAS THE FAIR MARKET VALUE

04:59:26.782 --> 04:59:28.183
OF THE PROPERTY'S HIGHEST AND

04:59:28.250 --> 04:59:29.551
BEST USE BASED ON CURRENT

04:59:29.618 --> 04:59:32.020
ZONING. SO IF IT'S ZONED

04:59:32.087 --> 04:59:33.722
RESIDENTIAL AND, YOU KNOW, AND

04:59:33.789 --> 04:59:35.557
IF THEY IF THEY WOULD BE ALLOWED

04:59:35.624 --> 04:59:38.160
TO JUST SELL IT AND TURN IT INTO

04:59:38.226 --> 04:59:40.762
A, YOU KNOW, A MAJOR HIGH RISE,

04:59:40.829 --> 04:59:42.197
IF THAT'S ALLOWED UNDER THE

04:59:42.264 --> 04:59:43.965
ZONING, THEN THAT WOULD BE

04:59:44.032 --> 04:59:45.667
INCORPORATED INTO THE APPRAISED

04:59:45.734 --> 04:59:47.002
VALUE. THAT WOULD HELP TO

04:59:47.069 --> 04:59:48.403
DETERMINE THE FAIR MARKET VALUE.

04:59:48.470 --> 04:59:49.671
FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS BILL,

04:59:49.738 --> 04:59:51.573
IF I MAY, MADAM CHAIR, AND THEN

04:59:51.640 --> 04:59:52.674
I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY

04:59:52.741 --> 04:59:53.975
COLLEAGUES, IF THAT WERE THE

04:59:54.042 --> 04:59:55.944
CASE AND IF WE NARROWED IT JUST

04:59:56.011 --> 04:59:59.081
TO I'M NOT SAYING THE AUTHOR IS

04:59:59.147 --> 04:59:59.715
DOING THIS, BUT IF WE NARROWED

04:59:59.781 --> 05:00:00.649
IT JUST TO WILDFIRES OR

05:00:00.716 --> 05:00:01.783
DISASTERS, AND IF THE FAIR

05:00:01.850 --> 05:00:04.019
MARKET VALUE WAS FOR THE HIGHEST

05:00:04.086 --> 05:00:07.022
AND BEST USE USE TO THE I FORGET

05:00:07.089 --> 05:00:09.024
WHICH. WHICH WITNESS AND IF IT

05:00:09.091 --> 05:00:10.892
WAS IF IT WAS, YOU'RE BASICALLY

05:00:10.959 --> 05:00:12.160
GETTING YOUR APPRAISAL FOR THE

05:00:12.227 --> 05:00:13.628
VALUE OF THE LAND. IF YOU WERE

05:00:13.695 --> 05:00:15.764
TO BUILD A 500 UNIT CONDO

05:00:15.831 --> 05:00:17.899
PROJECT ON THE BEACH, WOULD THAT

05:00:17.966 --> 05:00:20.502
NOT APPEASE? AND I'M NOT HOLDING

05:00:20.569 --> 05:00:22.237
YOU TO ANYTHING HERE. WE'RE NOT

05:00:22.304 --> 05:00:22.904
WE'RE NOT DICTATING TERMS. WE'RE

05:00:22.971 --> 05:00:24.873
NOT AMENDING THE BILL RIGHT NOW.

05:00:24.940 --> 05:00:26.908
BUT WOULD THAT APPEASE YOUR

05:00:26.975 --> 05:00:28.410
CONCERN ON ON THE PROCESS AT

05:00:28.477 --> 05:00:30.512
ALL? YOU STILL HAVE A MECHANISM,

05:00:30.579 --> 05:00:32.647
RIGHT. AND THAT MECHANISM IS YOU

05:00:32.714 --> 05:00:34.383
NEED TO GO SELL YOUR PROPERTY

05:00:34.449 --> 05:00:36.418
AND YOUR APPRAISER, MY APPRAISER

05:00:36.485 --> 05:00:38.453
AND THE APPRAISER IN THE MIDDLE.

05:00:38.520 --> 05:00:40.389
SO IT'S STILL GOING TO BE A

05:00:40.455 --> 05:00:41.857
SPLIT THE BABY. AND WHEN THE

05:00:41.923 --> 05:00:43.558
SENATOR SAYS, OH, THIS WORKS OUT

05:00:43.625 --> 05:00:45.594
OKAY WITH APPRAISALS. WELL, HE'S

05:00:45.660 --> 05:00:47.129
HE'S GOT THE VERY POINT THERE.

05:00:47.195 --> 05:00:48.730
IF YOU'RE BUYING A HOUSE, WHAT

05:00:48.797 --> 05:00:50.699
DO YOU DO? YOU GET YOUR OWN

05:00:50.766 --> 05:00:52.033
APPRAISER. WHAT IS THE BANK DO.

05:00:52.100 --> 05:00:53.602
THE BANK DOESN'T TRUST YOU. THE

05:00:53.668 --> 05:00:54.803
BANK GOES GETS THEIR OWN

05:00:54.870 --> 05:00:56.171
APPRAISER. IN FACT, THE BILL

05:00:56.238 --> 05:00:57.539
ADMITS ON ITS FACE THAT YOU JUST

05:00:57.606 --> 05:00:59.975
DON'T GO WITH LIKE THE ACTUAL

05:01:00.041 --> 05:01:01.443
MARKET VALUE DOESN'T COME OUT OF

05:01:01.510 --> 05:01:04.012
THE OF OUT OF THE MOUTH OF ONE

05:01:04.079 --> 05:01:04.579
APPRAISER BECAUSE THE BILL

05:01:04.646 --> 05:01:05.781
ACTUALLY SAYS, OH, NO,

05:01:05.847 --> 05:01:07.249
APPRAISERS DISAGREE. THAT'S WHY

05:01:07.315 --> 05:01:09.117
THE BILL IS DESIGNED IN THE

05:01:09.184 --> 05:01:11.219
SYSTEM OF YOUR APPRAISER, MY

05:01:11.286 --> 05:01:13.288
APPRAISER, AND THEN A SPLIT THE

05:01:13.355 --> 05:01:14.790
APPRAISER. AND WHAT'S GOING TO

05:01:14.856 --> 05:01:16.691
HAPPEN IS YOU'RE GOING TO FORCE

05:01:16.758 --> 05:01:18.126
YOU CAN'T BACK OUT OF THIS DEAL.

05:01:18.193 --> 05:01:19.561
THAT'S THE OTHER THING. SO IT'S

05:01:19.628 --> 05:01:21.730
NOT IT'S NEVER GOING TO BE FAIR

05:01:21.797 --> 05:01:23.165
MARKET VALUE. FAIR MARKET VALUE

05:01:23.231 --> 05:01:24.599
IS YEAH. THESE WORDS CALLED BONA

05:01:24.666 --> 05:01:26.067
FIDE. BUT REALLY WHAT IT IS, AS

05:01:26.134 --> 05:01:28.470
WE ALL KNOW IS, IS THE ARM'S

05:01:28.537 --> 05:01:30.205
LENGTH NEGOTIATION IN WHICH

05:01:30.272 --> 05:01:31.706
EITHER SIDE COULD GO BACK AND

05:01:31.773 --> 05:01:33.975
FORTH AND YOU CAN WALK AWAY.

05:01:34.042 --> 05:01:36.011
THIS IS BEFORE YOU CLOSE THE

05:01:36.077 --> 05:01:37.446
PARK, BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING TO

05:01:37.512 --> 05:01:38.880
ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE THE PARK.

05:01:38.947 --> 05:01:40.649
WE'RE GOING TO DENY YOU YOUR

05:01:40.715 --> 05:01:41.950
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO CLOSE

05:01:42.017 --> 05:01:42.684
THE PARK AND CHANGE USE. IF

05:01:42.751 --> 05:01:43.819
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT CLOSING

05:01:43.885 --> 05:01:45.954
THIS PARK, WE ARE GOING TO FORCE

05:01:46.021 --> 05:01:47.522
YOU TO COME OVER HERE AND WE'RE

05:01:47.589 --> 05:01:48.790
GOING TO FORCE YOU. YOU CAN'T

05:01:48.857 --> 05:01:51.493
BACK OUT OF THE DEAL. YOU HAVE

05:01:51.560 --> 05:01:53.662
TO SELL IT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

05:01:53.728 --> 05:01:54.996
WHEN WE LEAVE THIS ROOM, YOU'RE

05:01:55.063 --> 05:01:55.664
GOING TO SELL THIS PROPERTY AND

05:01:55.730 --> 05:01:57.833
YOU'RE GOING TO SELL IT BY YOUR

05:01:57.899 --> 05:01:59.401
APPRAISER. THEIR APPRAISER SPLIT

05:01:59.468 --> 05:02:00.469
THE BABY. THAT'S NOT GOING TO

05:02:00.535 --> 05:02:01.069
RESULT IN FAIR MARKET VALUE.

05:02:01.136 --> 05:02:04.206
WHEN WE'VE GOT A GUN TO OUR HEAD

05:02:04.272 --> 05:02:04.973
AND WE CAN'T LEAVE THE ROOM

05:02:05.040 --> 05:02:06.675
UNTIL THAT THIRD APPRAISER MAKES

05:02:06.741 --> 05:02:08.076
UP HIS MIND. GRANTED, THAT THIRD

05:02:08.143 --> 05:02:09.544
APPRAISER COULD COME CLOSER TO

05:02:09.611 --> 05:02:11.746
ME OR THE PARK OWNER, OR CLOSER

05:02:11.813 --> 05:02:12.848
TO THE TENANTS AND BRIEFLY,

05:02:12.914 --> 05:02:14.049
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. JUST NOT TO

05:02:14.115 --> 05:02:15.817
DOUBLE DIP, BUT JUST TO RAISE

05:02:15.884 --> 05:02:17.853
ONE MORE POINT. I MEAN, SO

05:02:17.919 --> 05:02:18.386
APPRECIATE THE CONCEPT OF

05:02:18.453 --> 05:02:19.955
NARROWING IT TO PARKS THAT ARE

05:02:20.021 --> 05:02:21.456
DESTROYED OR SOMETHING HAPPENS

05:02:21.523 --> 05:02:23.925
TO THEM LIKE THAT. BUT THE

05:02:23.992 --> 05:02:25.060
REALITY IS, IS THAT THE LAW

05:02:25.126 --> 05:02:26.461
STILL HANGS OVER EVERY PARK AT

05:02:26.528 --> 05:02:28.230
THAT POINT. AND THAT ALONE ALSO

05:02:28.296 --> 05:02:29.631
HAS AN IMPACT ON FAIR MARKET

05:02:29.698 --> 05:02:30.999
VALUE OF THAT OR THE MARKET

05:02:31.066 --> 05:02:33.668
VALUE OF THAT PARK. PEOPLE WHO

05:02:33.735 --> 05:02:35.437
ARE IN THE MARKET, WHICH IT'S

05:02:35.504 --> 05:02:36.638
ALREADY SMALL FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN

05:02:36.705 --> 05:02:38.340
MAKE A TRANSACTION LIKE THIS,

05:02:38.406 --> 05:02:39.908
ARE AWARE OF THE FACT THAT THAT

05:02:39.975 --> 05:02:41.743
LAW IS OUT THERE. IT WILL AFFECT

05:02:41.810 --> 05:02:44.079
THE VALUE. AND THAT, IN TURN HAS

05:02:44.145 --> 05:02:44.713
AN IMPLICATION CONSTITUTIONALLY.

05:02:44.779 --> 05:02:46.014
ALSO, ONE LAST THING, JUST TO

05:02:46.081 --> 05:02:47.215
TALK TO YOUR POINT ABOUT

05:02:47.282 --> 05:02:48.783
LIMITING IT JUST TO DESTROYED

05:02:48.850 --> 05:02:51.219
PARKS, I CAN KIND OF SEE THE

05:02:51.286 --> 05:02:52.988
MEMBERS GRAVITATING TOWARDS THAT

05:02:53.054 --> 05:02:54.723
IDEA, MEANING YOU'VE GOT A LOT

05:02:54.789 --> 05:02:55.824
OF MOBILE HOME PARKS IN THE

05:02:55.891 --> 05:02:57.692
STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ARE

05:02:57.759 --> 05:02:59.594
FULLY OPERATIONAL, AND LET'S LET

05:02:59.661 --> 05:03:01.296
THEM CLOSE THE PARK ACCORDING TO

05:03:01.363 --> 05:03:03.098
CALIFORNIA LAW. BUT OVER HERE,

05:03:03.164 --> 05:03:05.033
YOU'VE GOT A DESTROYED PARK AND

05:03:05.100 --> 05:03:06.668
THE TENANTS, AND EVERYONE IS

05:03:06.735 --> 05:03:08.069
SAYING YOU'VE GOT A DESTROYED

05:03:08.136 --> 05:03:09.638
PARK. I GUESS YOU'RE THINKING

05:03:09.704 --> 05:03:13.308
ABOUT CLOSING. WE'RE GOING TO

05:03:13.375 --> 05:03:15.744
SUBJECT YOU THE BURNT DOWN PARK

05:03:15.810 --> 05:03:17.946
TO THE APPRAISAL PROCESS. ISN'T

05:03:18.013 --> 05:03:20.749
THAT TERRIBLY UNFAIR? I MEAN,

05:03:20.815 --> 05:03:22.284
THAT THESE PARK OWNERS DON'T

05:03:22.350 --> 05:03:24.019
HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE

05:03:24.085 --> 05:03:25.153
APPRAISAL PROCESS, BUT YOU'RE

05:03:25.220 --> 05:03:26.955
SAYING WE COULD MAKE IT A LAW

05:03:27.022 --> 05:03:28.757
THAT THE BURNT DOWN ONE, JUST

05:03:28.823 --> 05:03:30.025
BECAUSE THEY HAD THE UNFORTUNATE

05:03:30.091 --> 05:03:32.394
EVENT? THE PARK OWNER HAD THE

05:03:32.460 --> 05:03:34.029
UNFORTUNATE EVENT TO BURN DOWN.

05:03:34.095 --> 05:03:35.630
YOU'RE REALLY PENALIZING THEM.

05:03:35.697 --> 05:03:37.432
YOU'RE MAKING JUST THE ONES THAT

05:03:37.499 --> 05:03:39.167
GOT BURNED DOWN. THOSE PARK

05:03:39.234 --> 05:03:40.769
OWNERS, AS OPPOSED TO ALL THESE

05:03:40.835 --> 05:03:41.770
PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T HAVE THEIR

05:03:41.836 --> 05:03:43.171
PARKS, BURNED DOWN. THESE PEOPLE

05:03:43.238 --> 05:03:44.973
GET PUNISHED FOR HAVING THEIR

05:03:45.040 --> 05:03:46.675
PARK BURNED DOWN, BECAUSE YOU'RE

05:03:46.741 --> 05:03:48.543
SAYING WE'LL MAKE IT A LAW THAT

05:03:48.610 --> 05:03:49.644
ONLY THESE KIND OF PEOPLE, THE

05:03:49.711 --> 05:03:50.779
DESTROYED PARKS, HAVE TO GO

05:03:50.845 --> 05:03:52.647
THROUGH THE APPRAISAL PROCESS?

05:03:52.714 --> 05:03:54.149
CAN I, IF I MAY, MADAM CHAIR,

05:03:54.215 --> 05:03:55.850
JUST TO RESPOND TO THAT? WELL, I

05:03:55.917 --> 05:03:57.819
DO THINK THE SCENARIOS ARE

05:03:57.886 --> 05:03:58.687
DIFFERENT IN THAT EXISTING LAW

05:03:58.753 --> 05:04:00.755
SAYS IF AN OWNER OF AN EXISTING

05:04:00.822 --> 05:04:02.657
PARK THAT DIDN'T BURN DOWN

05:04:02.724 --> 05:04:04.859
DECIDES TO CONVERT THE PARK, AND

05:04:04.926 --> 05:04:06.628
THOSE OWNERS DO NOT FIND ANOTHER

05:04:06.695 --> 05:04:08.496
MOBILE HOME, YOU ACTUALLY HAVE

05:04:08.563 --> 05:04:10.265
TO COMPENSATE THEM FOR THE FAIR

05:04:10.332 --> 05:04:11.800
MARKET VALUE OF THEIR TRAILER OF

05:04:11.866 --> 05:04:14.135
THEIR HOME. IN THIS CASE, WHEN

05:04:14.202 --> 05:04:16.137
IT BURNS DOWN, THAT FAIR MARKET

05:04:16.204 --> 05:04:18.440
VALUE IS ZERO. THEY DON'T HAVE

05:04:18.506 --> 05:04:20.108
ANYTHING. SO I DO THINK YOU'RE

05:04:20.175 --> 05:04:21.810
COMPARING APPLES AND ORANGES,

05:04:21.876 --> 05:04:22.410
AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE

05:04:22.477 --> 05:04:23.845
TRYING TO SAY. I THINK THE

05:04:23.912 --> 05:04:24.613
SCENARIOS ARE DIFFERENT, WHICH

05:04:24.679 --> 05:04:26.715
IS WHY THE SENATOR IS BRINGING

05:04:26.781 --> 05:04:27.816
THE BILL AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING

05:04:27.882 --> 05:04:29.484
TO FIGURE OUT. ALL WE'RE TRYING

05:04:29.551 --> 05:04:30.919
TO FIGURE OUT. I THINK WHAT THE

05:04:30.986 --> 05:04:32.921
SENATOR IS TRYING TO DO IS HOW

05:04:32.988 --> 05:04:35.223
DO WE INCENTIVIZE YOUR OWNERS TO

05:04:35.290 --> 05:04:36.391
ALLOW THEM TO COME BACK AND LIVE

05:04:36.458 --> 05:04:37.926
IN THEIR ONCE THEIR HOME THAT

05:04:37.993 --> 05:04:39.527
BURNED DOWN? AND MAYBE THIS

05:04:39.594 --> 05:04:41.396
ISN'T THE RIGHT METHOD. MAYBE

05:04:41.463 --> 05:04:42.964
IT'S THE STATE JUST GIVES YOU

05:04:43.031 --> 05:04:45.567
GUYS MONEY TO ACTUALLY KEEP THIS

05:04:45.634 --> 05:04:47.702
AS A MOBILE HOME AND PUT THE

05:04:47.769 --> 05:04:48.903
TRAILERS BACK ON AND ALLOW THEM

05:04:48.970 --> 05:04:50.805
TO COME. MAYBE THAT'S THE

05:04:50.872 --> 05:04:51.573
SOLUTION. AND IT ISN'T THAT. AND

05:04:51.640 --> 05:04:53.742
I'M NOT SAYING THAT THIS IS

05:04:53.808 --> 05:04:54.909
PERFECT. I FAR FROM IT, BUT I

05:04:54.976 --> 05:04:57.612
THINK ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS

05:04:57.679 --> 05:04:58.246
FIND A SOLUTION TO INCENTIVIZE

05:04:58.313 --> 05:04:59.681
YOUR OWNERS TO KEEP THIS AS A

05:04:59.748 --> 05:05:01.116
MOBILE HOME SO THAT PEOPLE HAVE

05:05:01.182 --> 05:05:03.118
A PLACE TO LIVE. SO JUST JUST TO

05:05:03.184 --> 05:05:05.620
PUSH BACK ON THAT. YEAH. I JUST

05:05:05.687 --> 05:05:06.287
WANTED TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION

05:05:06.354 --> 05:05:07.722
DIRECTLY. WHETHER THERE IS A

05:05:07.789 --> 05:05:08.957
SYSTEM FOR THIS THERE THERE'S A

05:05:09.024 --> 05:05:10.191
VERY SPECIFIC THERE'S ACTUALLY

05:05:10.258 --> 05:05:11.693
AN ACRONYM. IT'S SO COMMON THAT

05:05:11.760 --> 05:05:13.561
THERE'S AN ACRONYM FOR IT CALLED

05:05:13.628 --> 05:05:14.863
ROC. IT'S CALLED RESIDENT OWNED

05:05:14.929 --> 05:05:16.097
COMMUNITY. AND THERE'S A PROCESS

05:05:16.164 --> 05:05:17.832
WHERE DOZENS OF THESE MOBILE

05:05:17.899 --> 05:05:19.100
HOME PARKS THAT HAVE RESIDENTS

05:05:19.167 --> 05:05:20.735
WHO HAVE HAD CONTENTIOUS

05:05:20.802 --> 05:05:21.603
RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR OWNERS,

05:05:21.670 --> 05:05:23.638
THEIR OWNERS, YOU KNOW, FOR SOME

05:05:23.705 --> 05:05:26.041
REASON, WANTED A WAY OUT. AND

05:05:26.107 --> 05:05:27.409
I'VE ALWAYS SAID TO MY

05:05:27.475 --> 05:05:28.710
NEIGHBORS, LOOK, AT THE END OF

05:05:28.777 --> 05:05:31.079
THE DAY, WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO

05:05:31.146 --> 05:05:32.881
PAY AT LEAST A DOLLAR MORE FOR

05:05:32.947 --> 05:05:34.916
OUR PARK THAN ANYBODY ELSE

05:05:34.983 --> 05:05:37.886
WOULD, BECAUSE WE WOULD BE

05:05:37.952 --> 05:05:39.354
WILLING BECAUSE IT'S OUR

05:05:39.421 --> 05:05:40.455
COMMUNITY. AND, WELL, AT LEAST

05:05:40.522 --> 05:05:41.856
IN OUR SITUATION, JUST BECAUSE

05:05:41.923 --> 05:05:42.757
THERE'S RENT CONTROL AND THERE'S

05:05:42.824 --> 05:05:44.826
A LOT OF STIPULATIONS THAT WOULD

05:05:44.893 --> 05:05:45.960
MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM

05:05:46.027 --> 05:05:47.962
TO DO ANYTHING ELSE WITH IT. BUT

05:05:48.029 --> 05:05:49.898
JUST TO SAY THAT THERE IS THERE

05:05:49.964 --> 05:05:50.665
THERE ARE NONPROFIT

05:05:50.732 --> 05:05:51.332
ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE'VE REACHED

05:05:51.399 --> 05:05:52.767
OUT TO THAT WE'VE SPOKEN TO. ONE

05:05:52.834 --> 05:05:55.070
IS CALLED ROC USA, AND THEY THIS

05:05:55.136 --> 05:05:57.405
IS WHAT THEY DO ALL DAY LONG IS

05:05:57.472 --> 05:05:58.006
THEY THEY HELP RESIDENTS AND

05:05:58.073 --> 05:05:59.674
OWNERS COME TOGETHER. THERE'S

05:05:59.741 --> 05:06:00.675
ONE IN SAN DIEGO THAT DID A

05:06:00.742 --> 05:06:01.810
RESIDENT OWNED CONVERSION. AND

05:06:01.876 --> 05:06:03.812
THEY THEY TELL ME A STORY THAT

05:06:03.878 --> 05:06:05.747
EVERY YEAR ON THE DAY THAT IT

05:06:05.814 --> 05:06:07.048
WAS CONVERTED, THE OWNER, THE

05:06:07.115 --> 05:06:07.716
PREVIOUS OWNER ACTUALLY COMES IN

05:06:07.782 --> 05:06:08.950
AND THEY HAVE LIKE A CELEBRATORY

05:06:09.017 --> 05:06:11.052
THING WITH THE RESIDENTS BECAUSE

05:06:11.119 --> 05:06:12.454
IT WAS SUCH A WIN WIN FOR

05:06:12.520 --> 05:06:13.655
EVERYBODY. SO I JUST WANTED TO

05:06:13.722 --> 05:06:14.823
ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. THAT AND

05:06:14.889 --> 05:06:16.391
VERY BRIEFLY, ASSEMBLYMEMBER,

05:06:16.458 --> 05:06:17.759
JUST TO NOTE, YOU WERE ACTUALLY

05:06:17.826 --> 05:06:18.293
SPEAKING TO SOLUTIONS. YOU

05:06:18.359 --> 05:06:19.961
NAILED THE SOLUTION. AND WE

05:06:20.028 --> 05:06:20.562
RECOGNIZE THE CURRENT BUDGET

05:06:20.628 --> 05:06:22.163
SITUATION THAT WE'RE DEALING

05:06:22.230 --> 05:06:23.331
WITH IN CALIFORNIA. BUT YOU'RE

05:06:23.398 --> 05:06:24.799
CORRECT. THE SOLUTION IS THAT

05:06:24.866 --> 05:06:26.401
THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

05:06:26.468 --> 05:06:27.769
WORK WITH PARK OWNERS, NEGOTIATE

05:06:27.836 --> 05:06:29.704
WITH PARK OWNERS, AND COME TO AN

05:06:29.771 --> 05:06:30.538
ACCOMMODATION THAT GIVES THEM

05:06:30.605 --> 05:06:32.073
FAIR MARKET VALUE WITHOUT THE

05:06:32.140 --> 05:06:33.775
LEGISLATURE DEPRIVING THEM OF A

05:06:33.842 --> 05:06:34.809
FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTY RIGHT, AND

05:06:34.876 --> 05:06:36.978
ALLOWS THEM TO ACTUALLY HAVE AN

05:06:37.045 --> 05:06:38.446
INCENTIVE TO REOPEN A PARK.

05:06:38.513 --> 05:06:39.581
THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

05:06:39.647 --> 05:06:42.050
AND, AND, AND WE ARE NOT WITHOUT

05:06:42.117 --> 05:06:43.084
SYMPATHY. AND YOU DID SOMETHING

05:06:43.151 --> 05:06:44.352
THAT I'VE BEEN REMISS IN DOING.

05:06:44.419 --> 05:06:46.588
I NEED TO OFFER MY CONDOLENCES

05:06:46.654 --> 05:06:48.156
TO MR. BROWN AS WELL. I I'M

05:06:48.223 --> 05:06:50.992
SORRY FOR WHAT YOU AND YOUR

05:06:51.059 --> 05:06:51.693
COMMUNITY HAS GONE THROUGH. IT'S

05:06:51.760 --> 05:06:53.027
TRAGIC, BUT THE CORRECT SOLUTION

05:06:53.094 --> 05:06:54.662
IS THE ONE THAT YOU IDENTIFIED,

05:06:54.729 --> 05:07:03.238
NOT THE BILL HERE. YEAH. I NEVER

05:07:03.304 --> 05:07:05.640
SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU, SENATOR

05:07:05.707 --> 05:07:06.708
ALLEN, FOR BRINGING THIS BILL. I

05:07:06.775 --> 05:07:09.911
THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT ONE. I

05:07:09.978 --> 05:07:11.179
I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL

05:07:11.246 --> 05:07:14.149
TODAY. I, I THINK APPRAISALS ARE

05:07:14.215 --> 05:07:15.583
THE WAY YOU VALUE PROPERTY. I

05:07:15.650 --> 05:07:17.118
MEAN, I DON'T SEE ANYTHING IN

05:07:17.185 --> 05:07:19.187
THIS BILL THAT'S UNUSUAL. IT'S

05:07:19.254 --> 05:07:20.622
THE WAY MANY TRANSACTIONS ARE

05:07:20.688 --> 05:07:22.624
BEING DONE. I THINK EVEN THE

05:07:22.690 --> 05:07:24.159
OPENNESS YOU HAVE TO SORT OF THE

05:07:24.225 --> 05:07:25.693
STATE BUYING THIS LAND SOMEHOW

05:07:25.760 --> 05:07:27.028
WOULD BE BASED ON APPRAISALS.

05:07:27.095 --> 05:07:28.897
THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME THING

05:07:28.963 --> 05:07:31.733
THAT'S IN THIS BILL. SO I JUST

05:07:31.800 --> 05:07:35.003
THINK THAT THESE, THESE MOBILE

05:07:35.069 --> 05:07:37.772
HOME PARKS ARE, ARE ARE PEOPLE'S

05:07:37.839 --> 05:07:41.409
HOMES. THEY'RE DIFFERENT THAN

05:07:41.476 --> 05:07:44.412
THEY REQUIRE A DIFFERENT SORT OF

05:07:44.479 --> 05:07:45.380
LEVEL OF PROTECTION TO ALLOW

05:07:45.446 --> 05:07:48.917
PEOPLE TO CONTINUE TO LIVE WHERE

05:07:48.983 --> 05:07:50.318
THEY MADE SIGNIFICANT

05:07:50.385 --> 05:07:52.654
INVESTMENTS. AND, AND I, I THINK

05:07:52.720 --> 05:07:53.688
THE APPRAISAL PROCESS THAT'S IN

05:07:53.755 --> 05:07:55.456
THE BILL IS THE WAY WE VALUE

05:07:55.523 --> 05:07:58.560
PROPERTY. I MEAN, IT'S A THIS

05:07:58.626 --> 05:08:00.428
THE TERM SPLIT THE BABY. I'VE

05:08:00.495 --> 05:08:04.065
NEVER I'VE NEVER HEARD THAT WHEN

05:08:04.132 --> 05:08:05.934
YOU'RE USING SORT OF A NORMAL

05:08:06.000 --> 05:08:06.835
APPRAISAL PROCESS, IT'S NOT LIKE

05:08:06.901 --> 05:08:08.236
AN APPRAISER COMES IN AND

05:08:08.303 --> 05:08:09.737
THERE'S ONE THAT'S LOW AND ONE

05:08:09.804 --> 05:08:11.773
THAT'S HIGH. AND THEN THE ONE

05:08:11.840 --> 05:08:12.841
COMES IN THE MIDDLE AND YOU

05:08:12.907 --> 05:08:13.675
SPLIT THEM. THAT'S THAT'S JUST

05:08:13.741 --> 05:08:16.244
NOT THE WAY THE PROCESS WORKS.

05:08:16.311 --> 05:08:16.911
AND THAT'S TYPICAL IN VALUATION

05:08:16.978 --> 05:08:19.180
OF ALL KINDS OF PROPERTY. SO

05:08:19.247 --> 05:08:19.814
WITH THAT I JUST WANT TO THANK

05:08:19.881 --> 05:08:22.317
YOU. I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL

05:08:22.383 --> 05:08:26.821
TODAY. THANK YOU. AND I, I WANT

05:08:26.888 --> 05:08:28.690
TO GO AHEAD AND THANK THE AUTHOR

05:08:28.756 --> 05:08:30.625
AS WELL FOR BRINGING THIS BILL

05:08:30.692 --> 05:08:35.597
FORWARD. I HAD A QUESTION AS TO

05:08:35.663 --> 05:08:39.033
MAYBE A RATIONALE AS TO WHY NOT

05:08:39.100 --> 05:08:40.535
REMOVE SECTION THREE, AND MAYBE

05:08:40.602 --> 05:08:41.536
THERE'S A REASON BEHIND IT, BUT

05:08:41.603 --> 05:08:43.805
I JUST WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU.

05:08:43.872 --> 05:08:45.139
LIKE WHY NOT REMOVE IT. YEAH.

05:08:45.206 --> 05:08:47.375
WELL IT'S ULTIMATELY SECTION

05:08:47.442 --> 05:08:50.778
THREE IS THE SECTION THAT THAT

05:08:50.845 --> 05:08:52.413
CREATES THE MECHANISM FOR THE

05:08:52.480 --> 05:08:53.948
SALE. IF THE FOLKS WHO LIVED IN

05:08:54.015 --> 05:08:55.884
THE PROPERTY WANT TO COME

05:08:55.950 --> 05:08:59.053
TOGETHER AND PUT UP AN OFFER

05:08:59.120 --> 05:09:00.922
THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

05:09:00.989 --> 05:09:01.623
THEY'RE BASICALLY GIVEN THE

05:09:01.689 --> 05:09:03.157
RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL, THAT'S

05:09:03.224 --> 05:09:05.059
ESSENTIALLY WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

05:09:05.126 --> 05:09:07.528
YOU KNOW, IF THE IF THE IF THE

05:09:07.595 --> 05:09:08.529
LANDLORD'S PULLING OUT OF THE

05:09:08.596 --> 05:09:10.231
BUSINESS OF, OF MOBILE HOME

05:09:10.298 --> 05:09:12.867
PARKS, MAYBE WE END UP LIMITING

05:09:12.934 --> 05:09:14.335
IT JUST TO THESE DISASTER

05:09:14.402 --> 05:09:15.536
SITUATIONS, AS HAS BEEN

05:09:15.603 --> 05:09:17.939
SUGGESTED BY, BY BY THE ASSEMBLY

05:09:18.006 --> 05:09:19.707
MEMBER. BUT IN THE END OF THE

05:09:19.774 --> 05:09:21.676
DAY, IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE

05:09:21.743 --> 05:09:22.310
THAT, THAT THE COMMUNITY LIKE

05:09:22.377 --> 05:09:23.544
JOHN'S, WHICH IS JUST LOST

05:09:23.611 --> 05:09:24.879
EVERYTHING, WHOSE VALUE OF

05:09:24.946 --> 05:09:26.114
THEIR, OF THEIR PROPERTIES ARE

05:09:26.180 --> 05:09:27.682
LITERALLY ZERO. SO THEY DON'T

05:09:27.749 --> 05:09:29.117
EVEN GET ANY JUST COMPENSATION

05:09:29.183 --> 05:09:31.119
ASSOCIATED WITH WITH, WITH,

05:09:31.185 --> 05:09:32.754
WITH, WITH THE CHANGE OF STATUS

05:09:32.820 --> 05:09:35.223
OF THAT PARK TO BE ABLE TO COME

05:09:35.290 --> 05:09:36.691
TOGETHER AND, YOU KNOW, PUT UP

05:09:36.758 --> 05:09:38.493
AN OFFER AS LONG AS IT MEETS A

05:09:38.559 --> 05:09:41.129
FAIR APPRAISAL PROCESS TO BE

05:09:41.195 --> 05:09:42.830
ABLE TO BUY THE PROPERTY. THAT'S

05:09:42.897 --> 05:09:44.432
WHAT SECTION THREE PROVIDES FOR.

05:09:44.499 --> 05:09:47.468
AND BY THE WAY, IN THE BILL, IT

05:09:47.535 --> 05:09:49.504
ACTUALLY IF THEY IF THEY CAN

05:09:49.570 --> 05:09:51.172
NEGOTIATE IT FIRST, THEN THAT,

05:09:51.239 --> 05:09:52.874
THEN YOU AVOID THE APPRAISAL

05:09:52.941 --> 05:09:54.609
PROCESS ALTOGETHER. AND THE

05:09:54.676 --> 05:09:56.811
OTHER THING IS IT'S NOT IT'S NOT

05:09:56.878 --> 05:09:58.613
SPLIT THE BABY LITERALLY. IF THE

05:09:58.680 --> 05:10:00.782
TWO APPRAISALS ARE WITHIN 5%, IT

05:10:00.848 --> 05:10:03.017
ACTUALLY THE TIE GOES TO THE TO

05:10:03.084 --> 05:10:04.052
THE LANDLORD. I MEAN IT GOES TO

05:10:04.118 --> 05:10:06.254
THE HIGHER PRICE. IF THEY IF

05:10:06.321 --> 05:10:08.189
THEY ARE BEYOND A 5% DIFFERENCE,

05:10:08.256 --> 05:10:10.525
THEN THE TWO PARTIES TOGETHER

05:10:10.591 --> 05:10:14.062
CHOOSE A STANDALONE APPRAISER TO

05:10:14.128 --> 05:10:15.163
DETERMINE THE PROPER VALUE OF

05:10:15.229 --> 05:10:16.898
THE PROPERTY. SO THIS IS

05:10:16.965 --> 05:10:20.168
ULTIMATELY ABOUT ENSURING THAT

05:10:20.234 --> 05:10:22.537
THAT THAT YOU KNOW EVERYTHING

05:10:22.603 --> 05:10:23.905
ABOUT A TERRIBLE FIRE IS

05:10:23.972 --> 05:10:24.973
TERRIBLY UNFAIR. EVERYTHING

05:10:25.039 --> 05:10:26.841
ABOUT IT. IT'S UNFAIR TO THE TO

05:10:26.908 --> 05:10:28.242
THE PROPERTY OWNERS. IT'S ALSO

05:10:28.309 --> 05:10:29.744
FAIR AND FAIR TO THE PEOPLE WHO

05:10:29.811 --> 05:10:31.212
LOST EVERYTHING IN THE HOMES.

05:10:31.279 --> 05:10:32.447
IT'S ALSO TERRIBLY UNFAIR TO

05:10:32.513 --> 05:10:33.715
TELL THEM THAT THEY CAN'T, YOU

05:10:33.781 --> 05:10:35.016
KNOW, THAT THEY HAVE LITERALLY

05:10:35.083 --> 05:10:36.484
NO RIGHTS ASSOCIATED WITH WITH

05:10:36.551 --> 05:10:38.953
THEIR PROPERTY, NOT JUST BECAUSE

05:10:39.020 --> 05:10:41.622
THEY SUFFERED THROUGH A MASSIVE

05:10:41.689 --> 05:10:42.824
FIRE. YOU KNOW, TALK ABOUT

05:10:42.890 --> 05:10:44.125
TERRIBLY UNFAIR. I MEAN, GO, GO

05:10:44.192 --> 05:10:46.194
TALK TO THE FOLKS WHO WHO LOST

05:10:46.260 --> 05:10:48.329
EVERYTHING IN THE IN, YOU KNOW,

05:10:48.396 --> 05:10:51.099
AT THE PARK, YOU KNOW, IF

05:10:51.165 --> 05:10:52.533
ANYTHING, THEY HAVE SO MANY LESS

05:10:52.600 --> 05:10:54.102
RIGHTS WHEN THEY LOSE THEIR

05:10:54.168 --> 05:10:56.904
PROPERTY BECAUSE LITERALLY THEY

05:10:56.971 --> 05:10:59.140
THEY CAN'T EVEN GO BACK TO THE

05:10:59.207 --> 05:11:01.009
PROPERTY TO GO THROUGH THEIR TO,

05:11:01.075 --> 05:11:02.643
TO GO THROUGH THEIR ASHES

05:11:02.710 --> 05:11:04.045
WITHOUT THE EXPRESS PERMISSION

05:11:04.112 --> 05:11:05.046
OF THE PROPERTY OWNER. AND

05:11:05.113 --> 05:11:06.647
UNLIKE THE REST OF MY

05:11:06.714 --> 05:11:07.749
CONSTITUENTS WHO HAVE BEEN AT

05:11:07.815 --> 05:11:09.417
LEAST ABLE TO GO BACK TO THEIR

05:11:09.484 --> 05:11:10.818
HOMES AND SEARCH FOR WEDDING

05:11:10.885 --> 05:11:12.520
RINGS AND ALL THAT KIND OF

05:11:12.587 --> 05:11:13.588
THING. SO THE WHOLE THING IS

05:11:13.654 --> 05:11:14.689
FRAUGHT WITH UNFAIRNESS. THAT'S

05:11:14.756 --> 05:11:16.858
WHY WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING WE

05:11:16.924 --> 05:11:17.725
CAN TO PREVENT THESE FIRES FROM

05:11:17.792 --> 05:11:19.494
HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PLACE. IF

05:11:19.560 --> 05:11:20.795
I COULD RESPOND JUST BRIEFLY,

05:11:20.862 --> 05:11:22.630
YES, PLEASE. A RIGHT OF FIRST

05:11:22.697 --> 05:11:23.164
REFUSAL. THAT'S SOMETHING

05:11:23.231 --> 05:11:24.532
DIFFERENT, ISN'T IT? IT'S SAYING

05:11:24.599 --> 05:11:25.800
THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO BID ON

05:11:25.867 --> 05:11:27.735
THE PARK FIRST, BUT THE PARK CAN

05:11:27.802 --> 05:11:29.670
REJECT IT. THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS

05:11:29.737 --> 05:11:31.105
IS. I AGREE WITH THE MEMBER THAT

05:11:31.172 --> 05:11:32.407
THIS IS JUST THE WRONG

05:11:32.473 --> 05:11:34.042
MECHANISM. THIS IS A MECHANISM

05:11:34.108 --> 05:11:35.076
THAT FORCES YOU TO SELL IT. IT'S

05:11:35.143 --> 05:11:36.978
NOT A RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL.

05:11:37.045 --> 05:11:38.713
AND EVEN THIS POOR GENTLEMAN

05:11:38.780 --> 05:11:40.148
WHO'S HAD HIS MOBILE HOME

05:11:40.214 --> 05:11:41.482
DESTROYED, EVEN IN HIS

05:11:41.549 --> 05:11:42.950
TESTIMONY, HE SAID IN HIS

05:11:43.017 --> 05:11:45.953
TESTIMONY TO YOU THAT HE THINKS

05:11:46.020 --> 05:11:46.988
ULTIMATELY THE PARK OWNER SHOULD

05:11:47.055 --> 05:11:48.790
HAVE THE RIGHT TO CLOSE THE PARK

05:11:48.856 --> 05:11:51.626
AND CHANGE THE USE. HE SAID THAT

05:11:51.692 --> 05:11:53.428
THIS, TO BE CLEAR, DENIES YOU

05:11:53.494 --> 05:11:54.762
YOUR RIGHT TO CLOSE AND CHANGE

05:11:54.829 --> 05:11:56.664
THE PARK. IT SAYS IF YOU'RE

05:11:56.731 --> 05:11:58.499
THINKING ABOUT DOING IT, YOU

05:11:58.566 --> 05:12:00.668
CAN'T. YOU MUST GO SELL IT TO

05:12:00.735 --> 05:12:02.904
ONE OF THE QUALIFIED ENTITIES

05:12:02.970 --> 05:12:04.172
PURSUANT TO THIS APPRAISAL

05:12:04.238 --> 05:12:05.640
PROCESS. AND YOU CAN'T BACK OUT

05:12:05.706 --> 05:12:06.774
OF THE DEAL. THIS ISN'T A RIGHT

05:12:06.841 --> 05:12:08.543
OF FIRST REFUSAL. WHATEVER

05:12:08.609 --> 05:12:10.611
NUMBER COMES UP AND THE SENATOR

05:12:10.678 --> 05:12:12.313
SAYS, YOU'LL BE FINE, THE NUMBER

05:12:12.380 --> 05:12:13.981
WILL BE FINE. YOU'LL BE MADE

05:12:14.048 --> 05:12:15.683
WHOLE. NO ONE HAS TO WORRY ABOUT

05:12:15.750 --> 05:12:17.185
YOU. I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE

05:12:17.251 --> 05:12:21.155
CASE. AND SO IT'S A FOR SALE,

05:12:21.222 --> 05:12:22.990
WHICH IS THE DIFFERENCE WITHOUT

05:12:23.057 --> 05:12:25.059
ANY RIGHT TAKING AWAY COMPLETELY

05:12:25.126 --> 05:12:27.028
YOUR RIGHT TO CLOSE THE PARK AND

05:12:27.095 --> 05:12:30.998
CHANGE THE USE OF THE PARK. AND

05:12:31.065 --> 05:12:32.900
IF I, IF I COULD HEAR FROM THE

05:12:32.967 --> 05:12:35.303
SENATOR AS WELL AS I RESPECT

05:12:35.369 --> 05:12:36.871
THAT THE, THE ONLY IT ONLY

05:12:36.938 --> 05:12:38.806
BECOMES A QUOTE UNQUOTE FOR SALE

05:12:38.873 --> 05:12:41.275
IF THEY ARE ABLE TO COME UP WITH

05:12:41.342 --> 05:12:42.410
THE MONEY THAT MEETS THE

05:12:42.477 --> 05:12:44.946
APPRAISED VALUE OF THE PROPERTY,

05:12:45.012 --> 05:12:47.081
IF THEY'RE NOT, WHICH I THINK IN

05:12:47.148 --> 05:12:48.783
MANY, IN MANY CASES THEY WON'T

05:12:48.850 --> 05:12:51.986
BE ABLE TO. THEN THE LANDLORD,

05:12:52.053 --> 05:12:53.821
THE PROPERTY OWNER CAN GO AHEAD

05:12:53.888 --> 05:12:55.289
AND DO WHATEVER THEY WANT WITH

05:12:55.356 --> 05:12:56.457
THE PROPERTY. BY THE WAY,

05:12:56.524 --> 05:12:57.758
THERE'S ALREADY A LOT OF LOCAL

05:12:57.825 --> 05:12:59.594
PROCESSES IN PLACE THAT ARE

05:12:59.660 --> 05:13:00.695
ALREADY REQUIRED. AS HAS BEEN

05:13:00.761 --> 05:13:01.596
MENTIONED, THE ROCK AND OTHERS

05:13:01.662 --> 05:13:03.764
TO APPROVE A PARK CLOSURE. SO

05:13:03.831 --> 05:13:04.699
IT'S NOT AS THOUGH THIS BILL

05:13:04.765 --> 05:13:06.501
IMPOSES A WHOLE NEW SET OF RULES

05:13:06.567 --> 05:13:07.835
THAT AREN'T ALREADY IN PLACE.

05:13:07.902 --> 05:13:09.570
THERE'S ALREADY A WHOLE THERE'S

05:13:09.637 --> 05:13:11.672
A YOU KNOW VERY WELL. IT'S NOT

05:13:11.739 --> 05:13:13.641
AN EASY THING TO DO TO JUST WALK

05:13:13.708 --> 05:13:16.711
AWAY FROM A, FROM A, FROM A,

05:13:16.777 --> 05:13:19.447
FROM A MOBILE HOME PARK. SO I

05:13:19.514 --> 05:13:19.981
HOPE WE'RE NOT CONFLATING

05:13:20.047 --> 05:13:22.917
EXISTING LAW. AND YOU KNOW THAT

05:13:22.984 --> 05:13:24.852
THAT ALREADY ALREADY MAKES IT

05:13:24.919 --> 05:13:26.287
SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT FOR GOOD

05:13:26.354 --> 05:13:28.289
REASONS. RIGHT. BECAUSE THE END

05:13:28.356 --> 05:13:29.624
OF THE DAY, THIS IS WHERE PEOPLE

05:13:29.690 --> 05:13:31.392
LIVE. WELL, IT SEEMS LIKE MORE

05:13:31.459 --> 05:13:33.461
CONVERSATIONS NEED TO BE HELD,

05:13:33.528 --> 05:13:35.596
AND HOPEFULLY I GET A COMMITMENT

05:13:35.663 --> 05:13:37.198
TO HAVE MORE CONVERSATIONS AND

05:13:37.265 --> 05:13:39.734
HOPEFULLY IRON OUT SOME OF THESE

05:13:39.800 --> 05:13:40.768
ISSUES, BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE

05:13:40.835 --> 05:13:43.571
YOU JUST WANT TO HELP THE MOBILE

05:13:43.638 --> 05:13:46.874
HOME OWNERS, SO THAT WAY THEY

05:13:46.941 --> 05:13:48.176
CAN KEEP THEIR HOMES AND

05:13:48.242 --> 05:13:49.777
POTENTIALLY EVEN BUYING THE

05:13:49.844 --> 05:13:51.212
PROPERTY IF THEY'RE ABLE TO DO

05:13:51.279 --> 05:13:53.948
SO. SO HOPEFULLY CONVERSATIONS

05:13:54.015 --> 05:13:56.184
CAN CONTINUE. I WILL BE

05:13:56.250 --> 05:13:58.085
SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY.

05:13:58.152 --> 05:13:59.120
THANK YOU, BUT I'M LOOKING

05:13:59.187 --> 05:14:00.621
FORWARD TO THE FINAL OUTCOME.

05:14:00.688 --> 05:14:02.356
AND IF WHETHER IT BE STRIKING

05:14:02.423 --> 05:14:04.058
OUT SECTION THREE OR WHETHER IT

05:14:04.125 --> 05:14:06.961
BE MAYBE, POSSIBLY AMENDING IT

05:14:07.028 --> 05:14:09.030
TO HAVE CERTAIN LANGUAGE. BUT I

05:14:09.096 --> 05:14:10.765
WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE FINAL

05:14:10.831 --> 05:14:12.033
OUTCOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS

05:14:12.099 --> 05:14:13.834
THAT ARE GOING TO BE HELD. OKAY.

05:14:13.901 --> 05:14:14.702
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

05:14:14.769 --> 05:14:17.205
WOULD IT BE OKAY IF I JUST

05:14:17.271 --> 05:14:18.072
RESTATED THE ONE SENTENCE THAT I

05:14:18.139 --> 05:14:20.107
SAID, JUST TO BE CLEAR. SO I DO,

05:14:20.174 --> 05:14:21.776
BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT THEY

05:14:21.842 --> 05:14:23.578
SHOULD HAVE THAT RIGHT. IT'S

05:14:23.644 --> 05:14:25.246
JUST THAT TO SHUT DOWN THE PARK

05:14:25.313 --> 05:14:26.447
OR REDEVELOP. BUT I ONLY THINK

05:14:26.514 --> 05:14:27.982
THAT IT'S FAIR THAT THE PEOPLE

05:14:28.049 --> 05:14:28.849
WHO LIVE THERE, WHO ALREADY

05:14:28.916 --> 05:14:31.018
BUILT THEIR LIVES THERE, GET A

05:14:31.085 --> 05:14:32.053
REAL AND REGULATED OPPORTUNITY

05:14:32.119 --> 05:14:32.787
TO PURCHASE THE LAND BEFORE

05:14:32.853 --> 05:14:33.721
BEING PERMANENTLY DISPLACED.

05:14:33.788 --> 05:14:35.856
THERE'S NO THAT WAS THE FULL

05:14:35.923 --> 05:14:36.524
STATEMENT. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT.

05:14:36.591 --> 05:14:38.359
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE

05:14:38.426 --> 05:14:39.827
DIOCESE? YES. MR. I JUST WANT TO

05:14:39.894 --> 05:14:41.596
CLARIFY FOR THE AUTHOR, AND

05:14:41.662 --> 05:14:42.730
EVERYONE WILL BE SUPPORTING IT

05:14:42.797 --> 05:14:43.531
SO YOU CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE

05:14:43.598 --> 05:14:45.466
THESE CONVERSATIONS. I THINK

05:14:45.533 --> 05:14:46.534
I'VE MADE MY POINTS CLEAR AS TO

05:14:46.601 --> 05:14:48.436
WHERE I THINK THE WORK NEEDS TO

05:14:48.502 --> 05:14:50.571
BE DONE. AND OBVIOUSLY, I WANT

05:14:50.638 --> 05:14:52.373
TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO HELP

05:14:52.440 --> 05:14:53.574
FIRE VICTIMS AS WELL AS BALANCE

05:14:53.641 --> 05:14:55.276
THE, THE INTEREST OF THE OWNERS

05:14:55.343 --> 05:14:56.911
INVOLVED. SO WE'LL ALLOW YOU TO

05:14:56.978 --> 05:14:58.479
KIND OF CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT

05:14:58.546 --> 05:15:01.015
AND SEE SEE WHERE YOU END UP. SO

05:15:01.082 --> 05:15:04.318
ALL RIGHT. DO WE HAVE A MOTION.

05:15:04.385 --> 05:15:08.522
SECOND MOVE SECOND. ALL RIGHT.

05:15:08.589 --> 05:15:10.491
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE PLEASE

05:15:10.558 --> 05:15:11.759
SENATOR. YEAH I GENUINELY

05:15:11.826 --> 05:15:13.160
APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS

05:15:13.227 --> 05:15:14.295
WE'VE HAD BOTH WITH MEMBERS AND

05:15:14.362 --> 05:15:15.463
ALSO WITH THE OPPOSITION. WE'VE

05:15:15.529 --> 05:15:18.666
HAD SOME GOOD SIDEBARS ABOUT

05:15:18.733 --> 05:15:20.101
VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE BILL. AND

05:15:20.167 --> 05:15:21.936
WE ARE WE REALLY ARE OPEN TO

05:15:22.003 --> 05:15:23.638
MAKING REASONABLE CHANGES. I DO

05:15:23.704 --> 05:15:27.008
THINK THAT WE'VE GOT SOME THERE

05:15:27.074 --> 05:15:28.909
ARE SOME PHILOSOPHICAL

05:15:28.976 --> 05:15:31.045
DIFFERENCES. AND THEN I DO THINK

05:15:31.112 --> 05:15:33.981
THERE ARE SOME JUST FEARS ABOUT

05:15:34.048 --> 05:15:36.284
WHAT AN APPRAISAL PROCESS MIGHT

05:15:36.350 --> 05:15:39.720
MEAN VERSUS A MORE TRADITIONAL

05:15:39.787 --> 05:15:42.023
MARKET BASED SALE, YOU KNOW, SO

05:15:42.089 --> 05:15:43.858
BUT AGAIN, I'M IF THERE IF THERE

05:15:43.924 --> 05:15:46.294
ARE TWEAKS WE CAN MAKE TO THIS

05:15:46.360 --> 05:15:47.728
MECHANISM TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S

05:15:47.795 --> 05:15:49.797
MORE FAIR. I'M VERY OPEN TO THAT

05:15:49.864 --> 05:15:51.432
CONVERSATION. I'M VERY OPEN TO

05:15:51.499 --> 05:15:53.267
SOME REASONABLE NARROWING TO GET

05:15:53.334 --> 05:15:55.036
TO THE KIND OF CORE GOALS THAT

05:15:55.102 --> 05:15:56.671
I'M SEEKING TO ADDRESS HERE WITH

05:15:56.737 --> 05:15:58.572
THIS BILL. THIS IS HARD. THIS IS

05:15:58.639 --> 05:16:00.374
HARD STUFF. I MEAN, AT THE END

05:16:00.441 --> 05:16:01.642
OF THE DAY, IT'S CATASTROPHIC

05:16:01.709 --> 05:16:02.943
FIRES. IT'S PROPERTY RIGHTS,

05:16:03.010 --> 05:16:05.379
IT'S PEOPLE'S HOMES. THAT'S WHAT

05:16:05.446 --> 05:16:06.747
MAKES SERVING ON JUDICIARY

05:16:06.814 --> 05:16:08.983
COMMITTEE HEARTBREAKING AND

05:16:09.050 --> 05:16:10.418
EXHILARATING, RIGHT? I SERVE ON

05:16:10.484 --> 05:16:11.852
THE SENATE SIDE, AND WE DEAL

05:16:11.919 --> 05:16:13.020
WITH THESE KINDS OF DIFFICULT

05:16:13.087 --> 05:16:15.256
BILLS ALL THE TIME. AND SO, OF

05:16:15.323 --> 05:16:16.290
COURSE, WE'RE ALL WE'RE ALL

05:16:16.357 --> 05:16:17.692
GRAPPLING WITH SOME REALLY TOUGH

05:16:17.758 --> 05:16:19.627
ISSUES HERE. AND SO I APPRECIATE

05:16:19.694 --> 05:16:21.028
THE COMMENTS. I APPRECIATE THE

05:16:21.095 --> 05:16:22.096
OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE WORKING

05:16:22.163 --> 05:16:23.864
ON THIS. AND I'M ABSOLUTELY

05:16:23.931 --> 05:16:25.299
GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH

05:16:25.366 --> 05:16:27.068
THE OPPOSITION TO SEE WHETHER WE

05:16:27.134 --> 05:16:28.035
CAN COME TO SOME COMMON GROUND.

05:16:28.102 --> 05:16:29.570
AND WITH THAT, I ASK FOR A VOTE.

05:16:29.637 --> 05:16:31.839
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. MOTIONS DO

05:16:31.906 --> 05:16:33.207
PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS. LARA

05:16:33.274 --> 05:16:35.409
DIXON OPPOSED. NO. DIXON. NO

05:16:35.476 --> 05:16:38.312
HEART. HEART, EYE. BRIAN.

05:16:38.379 --> 05:16:40.381
CONNOLLY. CONNOLLY. EYE.

05:16:40.448 --> 05:16:41.849
GARABEDIAN. GARABEDIAN. EYE.

05:16:41.916 --> 05:16:44.352
MACEDO. PACHECO. PACHECO. EYE.

05:16:44.418 --> 05:16:47.088

05:16:51.359 --> 05:16:56.330
IT'S ON. IT IS ON. CALL GOES ON.

05:16:56.397 --> 05:16:59.834
PARDON ME. OKAY. NEXT GOING TO

05:16:59.900 --> 05:17:04.138
ITEM 12, WHICH IS SENATOR STERN

05:17:04.205 --> 05:17:10.044
SB 771. AND THAT'S IT. THAT'S

05:17:10.111 --> 05:17:12.813
THE LAST ITEM I HAVE TO KEEP

05:17:12.880 --> 05:17:15.182
GOING BACK AND FORTH. THEY GOT

05:17:15.249 --> 05:17:16.317
TO GO BACK TO PRIVACY. OKAY.

05:17:16.384 --> 05:17:17.284
THANK YOU SENATOR. THANK YOU,

05:17:17.351 --> 05:17:19.720
MADAM CHAIR. I'LL TRY TO BE

05:17:19.787 --> 05:17:21.655
BRIEF. I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE ALL

05:17:21.722 --> 05:17:24.692
AT THE END OF A LONG HEARING

05:17:24.759 --> 05:17:29.330
HERE. SB 771 TRIES TO CLARIFY IN

05:17:29.397 --> 05:17:32.266
LAW THAT CORPORATIONS,

05:17:32.333 --> 05:17:33.200
ESPECIALLY SOCIAL MEDIA

05:17:33.267 --> 05:17:34.802
PLATFORMS, ARE SUBJECT TO THE

05:17:34.869 --> 05:17:37.838
SAME SAME LAWS WHEN IT COMES TO

05:17:37.905 --> 05:17:40.141
AIDING AND ABETTING HATE CRIMES,

05:17:40.207 --> 05:17:43.144
THAT REGULAR INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE

05:17:43.210 --> 05:17:46.180
ARE. IT DOES NOT CREATE A NEW

05:17:46.247 --> 05:17:47.014
RIGHT OF ACTION, AND THE

05:17:47.081 --> 05:17:49.617
COMPANIES SUBJECTED TO ARE

05:17:49.683 --> 05:17:50.818
ALREADY SUBJECT TO THESE

05:17:50.885 --> 05:17:52.153
EXISTING LAWS. REFERENCE IN THE

05:17:52.219 --> 05:17:54.555
BILL. WHETHER IT'S OUR CIVIL

05:17:54.622 --> 05:17:56.090
RIGHTS LAWS OR OUR HATE CRIMES

05:17:56.157 --> 05:17:57.758
LAWS. BUT WE WANT HERE IN THIS

05:17:57.825 --> 05:17:58.959
LEGISLATION THE APPLICABILITY OF

05:17:59.026 --> 05:18:00.861
THESE LAWS IN REGARD TO SOCIAL

05:18:00.928 --> 05:18:02.696
MEDIA PLATFORMS AND ESTABLISH

05:18:02.763 --> 05:18:06.000
PENALTIES THAT WILL DETER THE

05:18:06.066 --> 05:18:07.968
INCITEMENT, AIDING AND ABETTING

05:18:08.035 --> 05:18:11.405
OF HATE CRIMES THAT WE KNOW ARE

05:18:11.472 --> 05:18:12.006
ON THE RISE. FOR EXAMPLE, IF I

05:18:12.072 --> 05:18:14.642
IF SOMEONE WERE TO GO OUT TODAY

05:18:14.708 --> 05:18:16.811
AND INCITE A GROUP OF PEOPLE TO

05:18:16.877 --> 05:18:19.280
COMMIT AN ATTACK ON SOMEONE FOR

05:18:19.346 --> 05:18:21.515
THEIR NATIONALITY, THEIR

05:18:21.582 --> 05:18:23.384
RELIGION, THEIR GENDER, AND DO

05:18:23.451 --> 05:18:26.220
THAT AT A AT A RALLY, THAT

05:18:26.287 --> 05:18:28.355
PERSON WHO SAYS, LET'S GO OUT

05:18:28.422 --> 05:18:31.792
AND KILL X AND SOMEONE IS KILLED

05:18:31.859 --> 05:18:33.494
FOR AS A RESULT OF THAT, THAT

05:18:33.561 --> 05:18:34.929
THAT PERSON WOULD BE LIABLE FOR

05:18:34.995 --> 05:18:36.063
AIDING AND ABETTING A HATE

05:18:36.130 --> 05:18:38.999
CRIME. HOWEVER, IF YOU DO THAT

05:18:39.066 --> 05:18:39.900
THROUGH A SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM

05:18:39.967 --> 05:18:42.002
YOU'RE CURRENTLY, THERE'S A

05:18:42.069 --> 05:18:43.137
VAGARY IN THE LAW AS TO WHETHER

05:18:43.204 --> 05:18:44.472
YOU'RE SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL

05:18:44.538 --> 05:18:45.639
PENALTY IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE,

05:18:45.706 --> 05:18:48.142
AND CERTAINLY WHAT FINES AND

05:18:48.209 --> 05:18:48.976
PENALTIES YOU WOULD BE SUBJECT

05:18:49.043 --> 05:18:51.078
TO IS NOT ESTABLISHED IN LAW. WE

05:18:51.145 --> 05:18:52.613
BELIEVE THAT THE SOCIAL MEDIA

05:18:52.680 --> 05:18:54.648
PLATFORMS HAVE THE SAME, SHOULD

05:18:54.715 --> 05:18:56.050
HAVE THE SAME ACCOUNTABILITY

05:18:56.116 --> 05:18:58.652
THAT REGULAR PEOPLE ARE,

05:18:58.719 --> 05:18:59.320
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE

05:18:59.386 --> 05:19:01.121
SPREADING ILLEGAL CONTENT. SO

05:19:01.188 --> 05:19:02.490
THESE VIOLENCE, THREATS AND

05:19:02.556 --> 05:19:03.224
INTIMIDATION ARE TARGETING

05:19:03.290 --> 05:19:05.025
HISTORICALLY VULNERABLE

05:19:05.092 --> 05:19:07.194
POPULATIONS AT RECORD SHATTERING

05:19:07.261 --> 05:19:09.029
RATES, AND THAT THE INTERNET IS

05:19:09.096 --> 05:19:10.798
THE PRIMARY PLACE THAT THIS IS

05:19:10.865 --> 05:19:12.099
HAPPENING. ACCORDING TO A RECENT

05:19:12.166 --> 05:19:12.933
HARVARD STUDY, THERE'S ACTUALLY

05:19:13.000 --> 05:19:14.468
A CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

05:19:14.535 --> 05:19:17.004
THIS WIDESPREAD VIOLENCE AGAINST

05:19:17.071 --> 05:19:17.805
HISTORICALLY TARGETED GROUPS AND

05:19:17.872 --> 05:19:19.173
THE PRACTICES OF THESE

05:19:19.240 --> 05:19:20.941
PLATFORMS. AND THIS TREND IS

05:19:21.008 --> 05:19:22.710
ACCELERATING. SO WE FEEL LIKE

05:19:22.776 --> 05:19:23.477
WITH THIS ESCALATING DANGER,

05:19:23.544 --> 05:19:25.679
THIS CLARIFICATION AND LAWS IS

05:19:25.746 --> 05:19:27.047
IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW, AND

05:19:27.114 --> 05:19:28.482
ESPECIALLY THE KIND OF FINANCIAL

05:19:28.549 --> 05:19:32.119
PENALTIES THAT WE TAILOR TO THE

05:19:32.186 --> 05:19:33.220
ALGORITHMIC DISTRIBUTION OF

05:19:33.287 --> 05:19:34.722
CRIMINAL CONTENT, WE FEEL LIKE

05:19:34.788 --> 05:19:36.690
WE'LL PROVIDE A DETERRENT EFFECT

05:19:36.757 --> 05:19:38.225
TO ENSURE THAT THOSE ALGORITHMS

05:19:38.292 --> 05:19:40.728
AREN'T SORT OF INTENTIONALLY

05:19:40.794 --> 05:19:42.563
ELEVATING THE KINDS OF CONTENT

05:19:42.630 --> 05:19:44.565
THAT WILL INCITE THAT KIND OF

05:19:44.632 --> 05:19:46.066
VIOLENCE, SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY

05:19:46.133 --> 05:19:48.636
EARN CLICKS. SO I WANT TO ASK

05:19:48.702 --> 05:19:50.738
FOR YOUR I VOTE AND TURN TO OUR

05:19:50.804 --> 05:19:52.139
OUR LEAD WITNESS HERE, VLAD

APOLOGIES FOR SOCIAL IMPACT AND

05:19:56.911 --> 05:19:58.379
PARTNERSHIPS FOR THE SIMON

05:20:00.481 --> 05:20:00.948
HOWARD WITH THE CHILDREN'S

ADVOCACY INSTITUTE. THANK YOU

05:20:03.584 --> 05:20:05.152
VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON,

05:20:05.219 --> 05:20:06.954
CHAIR, AND MEMBERS OF THE

05:20:07.021 --> 05:20:08.122
COMMITTEE. I APPRECIATE THE

05:20:08.188 --> 05:20:09.189
OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU

05:20:09.256 --> 05:20:10.991
TODAY. AS YOU HEARD, MY NAME IS

05:20:11.058 --> 05:20:12.760
VLAD HIKIND. I SERVE AS THE

05:20:12.826 --> 05:20:13.694
EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT FOR

05:20:13.761 --> 05:20:14.662
SOCIAL IMPACT AND PARTNERSHIPS

05:20:14.728 --> 05:20:16.297
IN NORTH AMERICA FOR THE SIMON

05:20:16.363 --> 05:20:17.531
WIESENTHAL CENTER, ONE OF THE

05:20:17.598 --> 05:20:19.099
WORLD'S FOREMOST JEWISH HUMAN

05:20:19.166 --> 05:20:21.735
RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS. FOR NEARLY

05:20:21.802 --> 05:20:22.670
THREE DECADES, THE WIESENTHAL

05:20:22.736 --> 05:20:24.305
CENTER HAS TRACKED ONLINE HATE

05:20:24.371 --> 05:20:26.874
AND EXTREMISM. EACH YEAR, WE

05:20:26.941 --> 05:20:28.275
RELEASE OUR DIGITAL TERRORISM

05:20:28.342 --> 05:20:30.611
AND HATE REPORT CARD, EVALUATING

05:20:30.678 --> 05:20:32.913
HOW MAJOR SOCIAL MEDIA AND TECH

05:20:32.980 --> 05:20:35.449
COMPANIES CONFRONT OR FAIL TO

05:20:35.516 --> 05:20:37.651
CONFRONT EXTREMISM, HATE AND

05:20:37.718 --> 05:20:38.719
DISINFORMATION ON THEIR

05:20:38.786 --> 05:20:40.421
PLATFORMS. IN OUR LATEST REPORT

05:20:40.487 --> 05:20:42.990
CARD, MOST COMPANIES RECEIVE D'S

05:20:43.057 --> 05:20:45.459
AND F'S. THEY ARE FLUNKING THEIR

05:20:45.526 --> 05:20:47.194
BASIC OBLIGATION TO PROTECT THE

05:20:47.261 --> 05:20:48.996
PUBLIC FROM EXTREMIST CONTENT

05:20:49.063 --> 05:20:50.764
THAT COULD BE INTIMIDATING OR

05:20:50.831 --> 05:20:52.232
HARASSING. THESE FAILURES ARE

05:20:52.299 --> 05:20:55.035
NOT TECHNICAL GLITCHES. THEY ARE

05:20:55.102 --> 05:20:56.870
PURPOSEFUL AND SYSTEMIC.

05:20:56.937 --> 05:20:58.973
PLATFORMS ARE SLOW TO ACT, LACK

05:20:59.039 --> 05:21:00.074
TRANSPARENCY, AND OFTEN

05:21:00.140 --> 05:21:01.909
REINSTATE EXTREMIST ACCOUNTS.

05:21:01.976 --> 05:21:04.044
EVEN AFTER REMOVAL, THE CRISIS

05:21:04.111 --> 05:21:05.579
HAS ONLY WORSENED AS PLATFORMS

05:21:05.646 --> 05:21:07.047
HAVE LOOSENED WHAT IS PERMITTED

05:21:07.114 --> 05:21:09.183
AND GUTTED MODERATION TEAMS,

05:21:09.249 --> 05:21:11.018
EVEN WHILE REAPING RECORD

05:21:11.085 --> 05:21:12.820
PROFITS. CHAIR AND MEMBERS.

05:21:12.886 --> 05:21:14.955
HERE'S WHY THIS MATTERS. WHAT

05:21:15.022 --> 05:21:17.424
HAPPENS ONLINE DOES NOT STAY

05:21:17.491 --> 05:21:19.226
ONLINE. FROM THE TREE OF LIFE

05:21:19.293 --> 05:21:20.227
SYNAGOGUE MASSACRE IN PITTSBURGH

05:21:20.294 --> 05:21:21.729
TO THE BUFFALO SUPERMARKET

05:21:21.795 --> 05:21:23.964
SHOOTING, TO THE DOCUMENTED AND

05:21:24.031 --> 05:21:25.766
SKYROCKETING RATES OF HATE

05:21:25.833 --> 05:21:27.201
CRIMES, WE HAVE SEEN THE DEADLY

05:21:27.267 --> 05:21:29.103
LINK BETWEEN ONLINE

05:21:29.169 --> 05:21:30.571
RADICALIZATION AND REAL WORLD

05:21:30.638 --> 05:21:31.905
VIOLENCE. AND THAT DEADLY LINK

05:21:31.972 --> 05:21:34.041
IS SOCIAL MEDIA. THEIR

05:21:34.108 --> 05:21:35.376
ALGORITHMS AMPLIFY HATE BECAUSE

05:21:35.442 --> 05:21:37.544
HATE DRIVES, CLICKS AND CLICKS

05:21:37.611 --> 05:21:40.481
DRIVE PROFITS. VOLUNTARY

05:21:40.547 --> 05:21:41.582
SELF-REGULATION HAS FAILED. AS

05:21:41.649 --> 05:21:43.417
OUR REPORT CARD SHOWS, THE

05:21:43.484 --> 05:21:45.486
PROFIT MOTIVE GUARANTEES THAT

05:21:45.552 --> 05:21:46.987
PLATFORMS WILL NOT ACT WITH

05:21:47.054 --> 05:21:48.689
URGENCY OR CONSISTENCY. WITHOUT

05:21:48.756 --> 05:21:50.124
LEGISLATION LIKE THIS, THERE IS

05:21:50.190 --> 05:21:51.992
NO REAL RECOURSE FOR THE

05:21:52.059 --> 05:21:53.494
AMERICAN PUBLIC. CHAIR AND

05:21:53.560 --> 05:21:54.828
MEMBERS. THE STATUS QUO IS

05:21:54.895 --> 05:21:56.964
SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE. THE

05:21:57.031 --> 05:21:58.165
PLATFORMS KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY

05:21:58.232 --> 05:22:00.134
ARE DOING. SHAME DOESN'T WORK.

05:22:00.200 --> 05:22:02.569
CURRENT LAWS DO NOT WORK. IF WE

05:22:02.636 --> 05:22:04.238
ARE SERIOUS ABOUT ALTERING THEIR

05:22:04.304 --> 05:22:06.273
BEHAVIOR, THEN WE HAVE TO

05:22:06.340 --> 05:22:07.775
PREVENT THE PROFITS THAT CAN BE

05:22:07.841 --> 05:22:09.309
EARNED FOR KNOWINGLY SERVING AS

05:22:09.376 --> 05:22:10.177

FOR THIS BILL, WHAT IT DOES AND

05:22:43.677 --> 05:22:44.878
WHAT IT DOESN'T DO. I THINK FOR

CHANGE THE LEGAL DEFINITION OF

05:22:54.221 --> 05:22:55.889

VIEWPOINT BASED RESTRICTIONS,

05:22:57.291 --> 05:23:00.260

TO LIABILITY FOR PROTECTED

05:23:01.729 --> 05:23:03.931
EXPRESSION. IT IMPOSES LIABILITY

05:23:03.997 --> 05:23:05.999
ONLY WHEN A PLATFORM'S OWN

05:23:06.066 --> 05:23:08.068

05:25:15.195 --> 05:25:16.697
ME BEGIN BY EMPHASIZING THAT

05:25:16.763 --> 05:25:17.798
CTIA AND OUR MEMBER COMPANIES

05:25:17.865 --> 05:25:19.299
ARE DEEPLY COMMITTED TO

05:25:19.366 --> 05:25:20.367
FOSTERING A SAFER ONLINE

05:25:20.434 --> 05:25:21.702
ENVIRONMENT AND STAND READY TO

05:25:21.768 --> 05:25:22.569
COLLABORATE ON THOUGHTFUL

05:25:22.636 --> 05:25:23.637
LEGISLATION THAT ACHIEVES THIS

05:25:23.704 --> 05:25:25.439
GOAL. WHILE SENATE BILL SEVEN

05:25:25.505 --> 05:25:26.440
71ST MAY NOT EXPLICITLY MANDATE

05:25:26.506 --> 05:25:27.841
CONTENT REMOVAL, THE THREAT OF

05:25:27.908 --> 05:25:29.176
SWEEPING LIABILITY EFFECTIVELY

05:25:29.243 --> 05:25:30.844
COMPELS PLATFORMS TO TAKE DOWN A

05:25:30.911 --> 05:25:32.212
BROAD RANGE OF CONTENT,

05:25:32.279 --> 05:25:33.780
REGARDLESS OF MERIT. THE BILL

05:25:33.847 --> 05:25:35.315
FUNCTIONS AS A DE FACTO DELETE

05:25:35.382 --> 05:25:36.817
EVERYTHING DIRECTIVE, WHERE THE

05:25:36.884 --> 05:25:38.385
RISK OF LITIGATION DRIVES

05:25:38.452 --> 05:25:39.319
PLATFORMS TO SILENCE SPEECH

05:25:39.386 --> 05:25:40.787
RATHER THAN RISK NONCOMPLIANCE.

05:25:40.854 --> 05:25:41.822
IN SUCH AN ENVIRONMENT,

05:25:41.889 --> 05:25:42.990
PLATFORMS WILL NOT RISK

05:25:43.056 --> 05:25:43.857
LIABILITY AND OPT INTO THE

05:25:43.924 --> 05:25:45.626
SUPPRESSION OF LEGAL SPEECH.

05:25:45.692 --> 05:25:46.693
THIS PROPOSAL WOULD OPEN THE

05:25:46.760 --> 05:25:48.095
DOOR FOR BAD FAITH ACTORS TO

05:25:48.161 --> 05:25:49.096
WEAPONIZE VAGUE OR SUBJECTIVE

05:25:49.162 --> 05:25:51.265
CLAIMS OF HARM TO TARGET, AND

05:25:51.331 --> 05:25:51.932
SILENCE OPPOSING VIEWS. THAT IS

05:25:51.999 --> 05:25:53.333
NOT MEANINGFUL ACCOUNTABILITY.

05:25:53.400 --> 05:25:55.736
IT'S CENSORSHIP. SENATE BILL 771

05:25:55.802 --> 05:25:57.871
WOULD CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT

05:25:57.938 --> 05:25:58.605
WHERE THE MOST STRINGENT OR

05:25:58.672 --> 05:25:59.973
STRIDENT VOICES SET THE

05:26:00.040 --> 05:26:02.042
BOUNDARIES OF DISCOURSE TO THE

05:26:02.109 --> 05:26:03.143
DETRIMENT OF LEGITIMATE AND

05:26:03.210 --> 05:26:04.945
LAWFUL SPEECH. BEYOND ITS POLICY

05:26:05.012 --> 05:26:05.712
FLAWS, THE BILL RAISES

05:26:05.779 --> 05:26:07.080
SIGNIFICANT CONSTITUTIONAL

05:26:07.147 --> 05:26:08.582
CONCERNS. LIKE NEWSPAPERS AND

05:26:08.649 --> 05:26:09.349
BROADCASTERS, SOCIAL MEDIA

05:26:09.416 --> 05:26:10.751
PLATFORMS ARE ENTITLED TO

05:26:10.817 --> 05:26:12.152
PROTECTIONS AND DECIDING WHAT

05:26:12.219 --> 05:26:13.220
CONTENT THEY HOST. SENATE BILL

05:26:13.287 --> 05:26:14.688
771 INFRINGES UPON THOSE RIGHTS

05:26:14.755 --> 05:26:16.523
BY PENALIZING PLATFORMS NOT FOR

05:26:16.590 --> 05:26:18.659
WHAT THEY PUBLISH, BUT FOR WHAT?

05:26:18.725 --> 05:26:20.093
FOR WHAT, BUT FOR WHAT? THEY

05:26:20.160 --> 05:26:21.595
FAIL TO REMOVE AN APPROACH THAT

05:26:21.662 --> 05:26:22.996
DIRECTLY CONTRADICTS CORE FREE

05:26:23.063 --> 05:26:24.698
SPEECH PRINCIPLES. ADDITIONALLY,

05:26:24.765 --> 05:26:26.700
SENATE BILL 771 LIKELY CONFLICTS

05:26:26.767 --> 05:26:28.101
WITH FEDERAL LAW, PARTICULARLY

05:26:28.168 --> 05:26:29.436
SECTION 230 OF THE

05:26:29.503 --> 05:26:30.170
COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT,

05:26:30.237 --> 05:26:31.371
WHICH PROVIDES PLATFORMS

05:26:31.438 --> 05:26:32.706
IMMUNITY FOR THIRD PARTY CONTENT

05:26:32.773 --> 05:26:34.207
AND FOR GOOD FAITH CONTENT

05:26:34.274 --> 05:26:34.808
MODERATION DECISIONS. FEDERAL

05:26:34.875 --> 05:26:36.310
PRECEDENT IS WELL ESTABLISHED.

05:26:36.376 --> 05:26:38.478
STATE LAWS SUCH AS THESE ARE

05:26:38.545 --> 05:26:39.079
PREEMPTED. ULTIMATELY, SENATE

05:26:39.146 --> 05:26:40.681
BILL 771 WOULD NOT IMPROVE

05:26:40.747 --> 05:26:42.382
ONLINE SAFETY. INSTEAD, IT WOULD

05:26:42.449 --> 05:26:44.818
COMPEL OVER REMOVAL, DISCOURAGE

05:26:44.885 --> 05:26:46.453
OPEN DIALOG, AND CHILL FREE

05:26:46.520 --> 05:26:47.921
EXPRESSION ACROSS PLATFORMS. FOR

05:26:47.988 --> 05:26:49.656
THESE REASONS, ON BEHALF OF CTIA

05:26:49.723 --> 05:26:50.824
AND OUR INDUSTRY PARTNERS, I

05:26:50.891 --> 05:26:51.858
RESPECTFULLY URGE YOU TO VOTE NO

05:26:51.925 --> 05:26:53.627

05:27:12.446 --> 05:27:14.381
SEEING NONE COMING UP TO THE

05:27:14.448 --> 05:27:17.517
COMMITTEE? MR. CYBER. SO FIRST

05:27:17.584 --> 05:27:19.686
OF ALL, I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU

05:27:19.753 --> 05:27:21.788
FOR BRINGING THIS BILL. I'D LOVE

05:27:21.855 --> 05:27:23.290
TO BE ADDED AS A COAUTHOR IF

05:27:23.357 --> 05:27:24.524
THAT WOULD BE OPEN. THIS BILL, I

05:27:24.591 --> 05:27:26.059
THINK, IS REALLY IMPORTANT. I

05:27:26.126 --> 05:27:29.062
MEAN, I WE'VE SEEN, ESPECIALLY

05:27:29.129 --> 05:27:32.065
IN THE LAST FEW YEARS, THE

05:27:32.132 --> 05:27:33.667
INCREASES IN CALLS FOR VIOLENCE

05:27:33.734 --> 05:27:35.235
AGAINST SPECIFIC TARGETED

05:27:35.302 --> 05:27:37.804
COMMUNITIES. AND WE'VE SEEN

05:27:37.871 --> 05:27:40.374
THESE PLATFORMS DO VIRTUALLY

05:27:40.440 --> 05:27:45.078
NOTHING TO STOP, STOP THEM. IT'S

05:27:45.145 --> 05:27:49.016
IN MY MIND, IT'S WORSE THAN

05:27:49.082 --> 05:27:50.851
SOMEONE CALLING FOR VIOLENCE IN

05:27:50.917 --> 05:27:52.619
A PARK OR ON THE STREET CORNER

05:27:52.686 --> 05:27:55.489
BECAUSE OF THE POWER OF

05:27:55.555 --> 05:27:58.558
MAGNIFYING THIS ACROSS MILLIONS

05:27:58.625 --> 05:28:01.294
OF PEOPLE AND INCREASING THE

05:28:01.361 --> 05:28:03.930
RISK THAT VIOLENCE THAT THAT

05:28:03.997 --> 05:28:06.333
SOMEONE IS GOING TO ANSWER THE

05:28:06.400 --> 05:28:07.968
CALLS TO VIOLENCE THAT ARE

05:28:08.035 --> 05:28:10.937
OCCURRING. AND IT'S FRUSTRATING

05:28:11.004 --> 05:28:15.275
WHEN WE HAVE, YOU KNOW, I DON'T

05:28:15.342 --> 05:28:17.411
THINK THAT THIS IS A CHOICE

05:28:17.477 --> 05:28:20.714
BETWEEN HAVING ADEQUATE CONTENT

05:28:20.781 --> 05:28:23.183
MODERATION THAT IS CARVING OUT

05:28:23.250 --> 05:28:27.487
CLEARLY ILLEGAL HATE SPEECH AND

05:28:27.554 --> 05:28:30.023
SUPPRESSING SPEECH. YOU KNOW, IF

05:28:30.090 --> 05:28:32.392
YOU ARE, IF YOU HAVE THE

05:28:32.459 --> 05:28:34.061
PLATFORM, YOU HAVE A

05:28:34.127 --> 05:28:35.495
RESPONSIBILITY AND YOU CAN'T

05:28:35.562 --> 05:28:37.297
BASICALLY THROW UP YOUR HANDS

05:28:37.364 --> 05:28:39.299
AND BASICALLY SAY THAT BECAUSE

05:28:39.366 --> 05:28:41.268
IT'S DIFFICULT, WE'RE NOT GOING

05:28:41.334 --> 05:28:45.238
TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. SO I, I

05:28:45.305 --> 05:28:46.640
STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS. I THINK

05:28:46.706 --> 05:28:52.045
IT'S NEEDED. I'VE SEEN. YOU

05:28:52.112 --> 05:28:53.814
KNOW, I DON'T THINK THAT A, A

05:28:53.880 --> 05:28:57.117
WEEK GOES BY WHERE I DON'T HAVE

05:28:57.184 --> 05:29:00.253
MEMBERS OF MY STAFF FLAGGING

05:29:00.320 --> 05:29:02.522
CALLS TO VIOLENCE AGAINST

05:29:02.589 --> 05:29:03.924
MEMBERS OF THE JEWISH COMMUNITY,

05:29:03.990 --> 05:29:05.258
AGAINST MEMBERS OF THE LGBTQ

05:29:05.325 --> 05:29:07.194
COMMUNITY, AGAINST IMMIGRANTS,

05:29:07.260 --> 05:29:08.528
AGAINST MANY MARGINALIZED

05:29:08.595 --> 05:29:11.665
COMMUNITIES ONLINE. AND CLEARLY,

05:29:11.731 --> 05:29:14.534
THE PLATFORMS ARE ARE DOING LESS

05:29:14.601 --> 05:29:16.603
AND LESS AND LESS TO TRY TO

05:29:16.670 --> 05:29:17.804
MODERATE THIS. SO I WANT TO

05:29:17.871 --> 05:29:19.706
THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON

05:29:19.773 --> 05:29:20.907
THIS AND WILL BE STRONGLY

05:29:20.974 --> 05:29:23.343
SUPPORTING IT. THANK YOU. THANK

05:29:23.410 --> 05:29:26.646
YOU. ANY OTHER HAVE A MOTION? IS

05:29:26.713 --> 05:29:28.448
THERE A SECOND? I'LL SECOND IT.

05:29:28.515 --> 05:29:29.049
OKAY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THANK

05:29:29.116 --> 05:29:31.451
YOU, MR. CHAIR. I WANT TO THANK

05:29:31.518 --> 05:29:32.652
THE AUTHOR. I WANT TO THANK THE

05:29:32.719 --> 05:29:34.187
WITNESSES FOR BEING HERE. AND I

05:29:34.254 --> 05:29:34.955
THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE

05:29:35.021 --> 05:29:37.491
I THINK THIS IS GOING TO SET UP

05:29:37.557 --> 05:29:39.292
SOME, SOME LEGAL FRAMEWORKS

05:29:39.359 --> 05:29:40.360
WITHIN THE COURTS TO ACTUALLY

05:29:40.427 --> 05:29:41.928
ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. I VIEW THIS

05:29:41.995 --> 05:29:43.597
BILL AS A REMEDIES BILL. YOU

05:29:43.663 --> 05:29:45.031
KNOW, I MEAN, THE LIABILITY I

05:29:45.098 --> 05:29:47.200
THINK IS LAID OUT PRETTY, PRETTY

05:29:47.267 --> 05:29:49.002
WELL HERE AS TO WHAT IS ALREADY

05:29:49.069 --> 05:29:50.403
ON THE BOOKS IN TERMS OF

05:29:50.470 --> 05:29:52.005
LIABILITY, I DON'T THINK THIS

05:29:52.072 --> 05:29:54.341
ADDS TO IT. I THINK THIS JUST

05:29:54.407 --> 05:29:55.142
PROVIDES A REMEDY THAT WILL MAKE

05:29:55.208 --> 05:29:57.477
IT CLEAR TO ANYONE VIOLATING THE

05:29:57.544 --> 05:29:58.979
LAW WHAT THE PENALTIES ARE. YOU

05:29:59.045 --> 05:30:01.414
KNOW, AND I DO THINK THAT WE GET

05:30:01.481 --> 05:30:04.885
LOST IN, IN SORT OF THE

05:30:04.951 --> 05:30:05.519
INTRICACIES AND THE DETAILS OF

05:30:05.585 --> 05:30:06.987
THESE BILLS SOMETIMES, AND I

05:30:07.053 --> 05:30:09.489
COULDN'T AGREE WITH SOME MEMBERS

05:30:09.556 --> 05:30:10.857
MORE. I MEAN, I THINK IT'S

05:30:10.924 --> 05:30:13.793
IMPORTANT THAT BILLS LIKE THIS

05:30:13.860 --> 05:30:15.862
AND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO

05:30:15.929 --> 05:30:19.032
ACTUALLY CREATES A SPACE AND

05:30:19.099 --> 05:30:20.901
SPURS CONVERSATION WITH THESE

05:30:20.967 --> 05:30:22.736
SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS ABOUT

05:30:22.802 --> 05:30:24.571
WHAT IS GOING ON. AND I THINK

05:30:24.638 --> 05:30:26.106
THAT THERE'S SO MUCH HATE AND

05:30:26.173 --> 05:30:28.942
DIVISION AND CONFLICT ON THESE

05:30:29.009 --> 05:30:31.678
PLATFORMS, AND THAT HATE AND

05:30:31.745 --> 05:30:33.113
CONFLICT IS BEING MONETIZED, AND

05:30:33.180 --> 05:30:35.148
IT LEADS TO MORE MONEY AND MORE

05:30:35.215 --> 05:30:35.815
ADVERTISING AND MORE VIEWERSHIP.

05:30:35.882 --> 05:30:38.218
AND IT'S JUST THIS REALLY

05:30:38.285 --> 05:30:40.153
DANGEROUS CYCLE THAT WE ARE ALL

05:30:40.220 --> 05:30:42.155
IN AND OUR KIDS ARE IN. AND I

05:30:42.222 --> 05:30:44.391
THINK THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A

05:30:44.457 --> 05:30:45.425
VERY SERIOUS CONVERSATION ABOUT

05:30:45.492 --> 05:30:48.929
HOW ARE WE ADDRESSING THIS AND

05:30:48.995 --> 05:30:50.797
ACTUALLY SOLVING IT. AND I DON'T

05:30:50.864 --> 05:30:54.134
THINK THAT THE ANSWER IS 230. I

05:30:54.201 --> 05:30:55.869
DON'T THINK IT'S JUST BLANKET

05:30:55.936 --> 05:30:56.937
IMMUNITY, BECAUSE THAT'S

05:30:57.003 --> 05:30:58.138
OBVIOUSLY LED US TO WHERE WE

05:30:58.205 --> 05:31:00.173
ARE. AND IT MIGHT NOT BE THIS

05:31:00.240 --> 05:31:01.975
BILL, BUT THERE HAS TO BE

05:31:02.042 --> 05:31:04.844
SOMETHING WHERE WE FIND A

05:31:04.911 --> 05:31:06.279
RESOLUTION GOING FORWARD. SO OUR

05:31:06.346 --> 05:31:08.748
KIDS AND EVERY COMMUNITY WHO'S

05:31:08.815 --> 05:31:10.250
FEELING AND WHO ACTUALLY IS

05:31:10.317 --> 05:31:11.785
BEING TARGETED ON THESE

05:31:11.851 --> 05:31:14.154
PLATFORMS IS KEPT SAFE. SO I

05:31:14.221 --> 05:31:15.989
APPRECIATE YOU DOING THIS. LET'S

05:31:16.056 --> 05:31:18.258
SEE WHERE IT LEADS. BUT THESE

05:31:18.325 --> 05:31:19.793
ARE WORTHWHILE FIGHTS. SO THANK

05:31:19.859 --> 05:31:22.095
YOU. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER

05:31:22.162 --> 05:31:23.930
STEPHANIE. THANK YOU, CHAIR. I

05:31:23.997 --> 05:31:25.632
JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR

05:31:25.699 --> 05:31:26.533
FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I

05:31:26.600 --> 05:31:27.867
THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT, AND I

05:31:27.934 --> 05:31:30.604
WANT TO ALIGN MYSELF WITH THE

05:31:30.670 --> 05:31:31.137
COMMENTS OF THE ASSEMBLY

05:31:31.204 --> 05:31:32.372
MEMBERS. I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE

05:31:32.439 --> 05:31:33.707
WHAT I SEE, AND ESPECIALLY WITH

05:31:33.773 --> 05:31:35.108
WHAT THE JEWISH COMMUNITY IS

05:31:35.175 --> 05:31:36.176
GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW. IT'S

05:31:36.243 --> 05:31:38.044
JUST SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE.

05:31:38.111 --> 05:31:39.079
AND I REMEMBER WATCHING THAT

05:31:39.145 --> 05:31:42.249
MOVIE THE SOCIAL DILEMMA, ABOUT

05:31:42.315 --> 05:31:45.619
SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE POWER OF

05:31:45.685 --> 05:31:47.687
ALGORITHMS AND HOW WHEN USED SO

05:31:47.754 --> 05:31:48.822
NEGATIVELY, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE

05:31:48.888 --> 05:31:49.756
MAKING MONEY OFF THAT. I

05:31:49.823 --> 05:31:51.691
THOUGHT, WOULDN'T IT BE

05:31:51.758 --> 05:31:53.193
INCREDIBLE IF THERE WAS SOMEONE

05:31:53.260 --> 05:31:53.793
THAT USED THAT ALGORITHM FOR

05:31:53.860 --> 05:31:55.028
GOOD, LIKE TURN THAT ALGORITHM

05:31:55.095 --> 05:31:56.663
INTO MAKING EVERYONE LIKE EACH

05:31:56.730 --> 05:31:58.832
OTHER? IT'S VERY NAIVE POSITION,

05:31:58.898 --> 05:32:00.400
PROBABLY, BUT AT THE SAME TIME,

05:32:00.467 --> 05:32:02.469
THIS IS SO NECESSARY BECAUSE OF

05:32:02.535 --> 05:32:04.604
THE POWER OF SOCIAL MEDIA. AND

05:32:04.671 --> 05:32:06.172
WHEN IT STIRS UP HATE SPEECH,

05:32:06.239 --> 05:32:08.608
WHEN IT WHEN IT PROMOTES PEOPLE

05:32:08.675 --> 05:32:10.510
TO DO HORRIBLE THINGS TO

05:32:10.577 --> 05:32:11.811
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

05:32:11.878 --> 05:32:12.479
MARGINALIZED AND ESPECIALLY,

05:32:12.545 --> 05:32:14.180
AGAIN, WHAT WE SEE OUR JEWISH

05:32:14.247 --> 05:32:15.548
COMMUNITY GOING THROUGH, IT IS

05:32:15.615 --> 05:32:18.418
SOMETHING THAT IT IS BEYOND

05:32:18.485 --> 05:32:19.886
NECESSARY. SO I'M HAPPY TO

05:32:19.953 --> 05:32:21.321
SUPPORT IT TODAY, AND I WOULD

05:32:21.388 --> 05:32:22.856
LOVE TO BE ADDED AS A COAUTHOR

05:32:22.922 --> 05:32:25.258
OF YOU'RE TAKING THEM. THANK

05:32:25.325 --> 05:32:26.960
YOU. ANY OTHER ANY OTHER

05:32:27.027 --> 05:32:29.596
COAUTHOR REQUESTS? ANYBODY ELSE?

05:32:29.663 --> 05:32:31.665
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS?

05:32:31.731 --> 05:32:33.466
YEAH. I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU,

05:32:33.533 --> 05:32:35.702
SENATOR. I MEAN, THESE ARE THE

05:32:35.769 --> 05:32:36.736
KINDS OF THINGS THAT IT ALWAYS

05:32:36.803 --> 05:32:37.837
FEELS LIKE IT'S I THINK IT'S

05:32:37.904 --> 05:32:40.273
TRUE THAT WE'RE KIND OF WE'RE

05:32:40.340 --> 05:32:40.874
FALLING BEHIND THE TECHNOLOGY,

05:32:40.940 --> 05:32:42.542
BUT IT ISN'T TOO LATE TO CATCH

05:32:42.609 --> 05:32:43.977
UP. AND I THINK THAT THIS BILL

05:32:44.044 --> 05:32:46.279
IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO ALLOW

05:32:46.346 --> 05:32:48.315
US TO AT LEAST TRY TO DO THAT,

05:32:48.381 --> 05:32:51.217
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO

05:32:51.284 --> 05:32:52.585
PROTECTING OUR YOUTH, PROTECTING

05:32:52.652 --> 05:32:54.721
FOLKS FROM AND PUTTING SOME

05:32:54.788 --> 05:32:56.389
RESPONSIBILITY. THERE IS SOME

05:32:56.456 --> 05:32:57.223
RESPONSIBILITY ON THESE

05:32:57.290 --> 05:32:58.925
COMPANIES. WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE

05:32:58.992 --> 05:33:00.627
OUT HOW WE THREAD THE NEEDLE TO

05:33:00.694 --> 05:33:02.595
ALLOW FOR THEM TO, YOU KNOW, BE

05:33:02.662 --> 05:33:04.397
INNOVATIVE AND ALLOW FOR FREE

05:33:04.464 --> 05:33:06.299
EXCHANGE OF IDEAS. BUT THAT IS

05:33:06.366 --> 05:33:08.368
NOT WITHOUT LIMITS. AND SO I

05:33:08.435 --> 05:33:11.538
REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON

05:33:11.604 --> 05:33:12.872
THIS. Þ DO YOU ACCEPT THE

05:33:12.939 --> 05:33:14.007
COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS? OKAY.

05:33:14.074 --> 05:33:15.408
SORRY. YES, I FORGOT TO ASK

05:33:15.475 --> 05:33:17.143
THAT. YES. THAT'S MY THAT'S MY

05:33:17.210 --> 05:33:19.212
STAFF'S DOING TO MAKE SURE I'M

05:33:19.279 --> 05:33:20.914
ON ON TASK. BUT YEAH, I WOULD

05:33:20.980 --> 05:33:23.149
ALSO LIKE TO BE ADDED AS

05:33:23.216 --> 05:33:23.950
COAUTHOR. WOULD YOU LIKE TO

05:33:24.017 --> 05:33:26.386
CLOSE, SIR? THANK YOU, MR.

05:33:26.453 --> 05:33:30.390
CHAIR. I THOUGHT MR. HAIRABEDIAN

05:33:30.457 --> 05:33:33.660
SUMMARIZED IT WELL IN TERMS OF

05:33:33.727 --> 05:33:36.763
NO NEW LIABILITY HERE, JUST NEW

05:33:36.830 --> 05:33:40.367
REMEDIES. AND YOU KNOW, THESE

05:33:40.433 --> 05:33:43.603
THERE ARE ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS.

05:33:43.670 --> 05:33:45.672
IF THEY WOULD SAY DROP

05:33:45.739 --> 05:33:47.974
LITIGATION ON OUR ALGORITHMIC

05:33:48.041 --> 05:33:49.109
DISCLOSURE LAWS THAT WE'VE

05:33:49.175 --> 05:33:50.310
PASSED IN YEARS PAST THAT ARE

05:33:50.377 --> 05:33:52.712
NOW HELD UP IN COURT TO ENSURE

05:33:52.779 --> 05:33:55.181
THAT ALGORITHMS ARE AT LEAST

05:33:55.248 --> 05:33:56.716
SAFE FOR CHILDREN OR ADHERE TO

05:33:56.783 --> 05:33:58.351
SOME KIND OF MINIMUM STANDARDS.

05:33:58.418 --> 05:33:59.386
I THINK THERE COULD BE A

05:33:59.452 --> 05:34:01.054
POTENTIALLY A RACE TO THE TOP,

05:34:01.121 --> 05:34:03.056
AND I HOPE THAT THIS BILL

05:34:03.123 --> 05:34:04.157
TRIGGERS SOME HEALTHY

05:34:04.224 --> 05:34:05.592
COMPETITION BETWEEN OUR

05:34:05.658 --> 05:34:06.793
PLATFORMS TO ACTUALLY CHALLENGE

05:34:06.860 --> 05:34:10.063
EACH OTHER TO BE PLACES WHERE

05:34:10.130 --> 05:34:11.765
GOOD WE'RE GOOD ACTUALLY HAPPENS

05:34:11.831 --> 05:34:15.068
TO SOME OF STEPHANIE'S POINT.
