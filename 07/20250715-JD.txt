THIS MORNING AND THIS AFTERNOON.

00:36:56.447 --> 00:36:58.015
WE DO NOT HAVE A QUORUM, BUT WE

00:36:58.082 --> 00:37:00.451
WILL GO AHEAD AND BEGIN AS A

00:37:00.518 --> 00:37:02.553
SUBCOMMITTEE. AND WE HAVE

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:04.822
SENATOR WIENER WITH US, WHO IS

00:37:04.889 --> 00:37:07.191
SENATOR WIENER HAS TWO BILLS,

00:37:07.258 --> 00:37:09.694

WIENER YOU WANT TO GET YOUR

00:37:14.832 --> 00:37:16.934
COFFEE THERE AND THEN WHENEVER

00:37:17.001 --> 00:37:19.537
YOU'RE READY, WE'LL START WITH

00:37:19.604 --> 00:37:22.707
THE FIRST ONE, THEN 41. SURE.

00:37:22.773 --> 00:37:24.675
OKAY. JUST YOU AND ME, MR.

00:37:24.742 --> 00:37:49.800
CHAIR. HI.

00:37:49.867 --> 00:37:52.737
OKAY. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. I'M

00:37:52.803 --> 00:37:54.805
HERE TO PRESENT SENATE BILL 41,

00:37:54.872 --> 00:37:57.341
WHICH WILL REQUIRE TRANSPARENCY

00:37:57.408 --> 00:37:59.777
AND PUT A STOP TO ABUSIVE

00:37:59.844 --> 00:38:01.512
PRACTICES BY PHARMACY BENEFIT

00:38:01.579 --> 00:38:05.182
MANAGERS OR PBMS, PRACTICES THAT

00:38:05.249 --> 00:38:07.852
ARE LEADING TO THAT INCREASE THE

00:38:07.918 --> 00:38:09.487
COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND

00:38:09.553 --> 00:38:12.089
THAT ARE KILLING OFF

00:38:12.156 --> 00:38:13.758
NEIGHBORHOOD PHARMACIES. I WANT

00:38:13.824 --> 00:38:15.026
TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR

00:38:15.092 --> 00:38:17.428
WORKING WITH US, AND I'M HAPPY

00:38:17.495 --> 00:38:18.529
TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE'S

00:38:18.596 --> 00:38:22.400
AMENDMENTS. PBMS STARTED OFF AS

00:38:22.466 --> 00:38:24.268
SMALL ADMINISTRATIVE ENTITIES

00:38:24.335 --> 00:38:26.437
DESIGNED TO HELP HEALTH PLANS TO

00:38:26.504 --> 00:38:28.739
PUT TOGETHER FORMULARIES AND

00:38:28.806 --> 00:38:31.075
NEGOTIATE DRUG PRICES. WELCOME,

00:38:31.142 --> 00:38:36.147
ASSEMBLYMEMBER. THEY HAVE NOW

00:38:36.213 --> 00:38:39.316
GROWN OVER THE DECADES INTO MEGA

00:38:39.383 --> 00:38:41.886
PLAYERS IN THE HEALTH CARE

00:38:41.952 --> 00:38:43.688
SPACE, SOMETIMES BIGGER THAN

00:38:43.754 --> 00:38:46.223
HEALTH PLANS MERGE WITH HEALTH

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:48.359
PLANS INTEGRATED. THEY OWN THEIR

00:38:48.426 --> 00:38:52.063
OWN PHARMACIES AND THEY PLAY.

00:38:52.129 --> 00:38:54.799
THEY HAVE HUGE LEVERAGE IN

00:38:54.865 --> 00:38:58.102
DETERMINING WHAT GOES ON TO A

00:38:58.169 --> 00:39:00.604
FORMULARY, SETTING THE COSTS AND

00:39:00.671 --> 00:39:02.006
REALLY DETERMINING WHERE PEOPLE

00:39:02.073 --> 00:39:04.875
CAN GET AND HOW THEY CAN GET

00:39:04.942 --> 00:39:06.610
THEIR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. WE'RE

00:39:06.677 --> 00:39:07.812
SEEING, FIRST OF ALL, PRACTICE

00:39:07.878 --> 00:39:09.280
THAT KILLS OFF NEIGHBORHOOD

00:39:09.346 --> 00:39:11.415
PHARMACIES, PATIENTS STEERING

00:39:11.482 --> 00:39:14.985
WHERE PBMS EFFECTIVELY FORCE

00:39:15.052 --> 00:39:17.188
PEOPLE TO USE THEIR OWN MAIL

00:39:17.254 --> 00:39:18.456
ORDER PHARMACIES INSTEAD OF

00:39:18.522 --> 00:39:20.291
THEIR CHOSEN NEIGHBORHOOD

00:39:20.357 --> 00:39:21.392
PHARMACIES, WHERE THEY CAN

00:39:21.459 --> 00:39:23.627
INTERACT WITH PHARMACISTS FACE

00:39:23.694 --> 00:39:26.597
TO FACE. AND SO WE SOMETIMES

00:39:26.664 --> 00:39:28.599
PEOPLE SEE THIS MOST COMMONLY

00:39:28.666 --> 00:39:30.901
WHEN YOU'RE TOLD IF YOU GO

00:39:30.968 --> 00:39:32.436
THROUGH THE MAIL ORDER PHARMACY,

00:39:32.503 --> 00:39:34.338
YOU CAN GET A 90 DAY SUPPLY. BUT

00:39:34.405 --> 00:39:36.040
IF YOU HAVE THE GALL TO WANT TO

00:39:36.107 --> 00:39:38.242
GO TO YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD

00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:39.076
PHARMACY, YOU ONLY GET A 30 DAY

00:39:39.143 --> 00:39:40.478
SUPPLY. THAT IS A CLASSIC FORM

00:39:40.544 --> 00:39:42.580
OF MANIPULATION, PATIENT

00:39:42.646 --> 00:39:44.982
STEERING. AND THAT'S JUST ONE

00:39:45.049 --> 00:39:47.084
EXAMPLE. THIS BILL WILL PUT AN

00:39:47.151 --> 00:39:49.220
END TO THAT PRACTICE. THE BILL

00:39:49.286 --> 00:39:51.322
ALSO ENDS A NUMBER OF

00:39:51.388 --> 00:39:53.858
COMPENSATION STRUCTURES FOR PBMS

00:39:53.924 --> 00:39:56.794
THAT LEAD TO RISING COSTS. FOR

00:39:56.861 --> 00:39:59.663
EXAMPLE, MAKING SURE THAT FOR

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:02.133
REBATES THAT THE ENTIRETY OF A

00:40:02.199 --> 00:40:04.201
REBATE THAT PBM NEGOTIATES WITH

00:40:04.268 --> 00:40:06.103
A DRUG MANUFACTURER GETS PASSED

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:08.239
THROUGH. RIGHT NOW, PBMS WILL

00:40:08.305 --> 00:40:11.175
KEEP A PORTION, A SLICE OF THE

00:40:11.242 --> 00:40:12.643
REBATE. AND SO THE HIGHER THE

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:14.745
REBATE, THE HIGHER THEIR

00:40:14.812 --> 00:40:15.412
COMPENSATION, MEANING THE HIGHER

00:40:15.479 --> 00:40:17.915
THE DRUG COST, THE HIGHER THEIR

00:40:17.982 --> 00:40:19.016
COMPENSATION. IT ALSO PUTS A

00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:22.953
STOP TO SPREAD PRICING WHERE

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:24.054
PBMS GET PAID A CERTAIN AMOUNT

00:40:24.121 --> 00:40:25.956
BY A HEALTH PLAN AND THEN PAY

00:40:26.023 --> 00:40:28.959
LESS TO THE PHARMACY. THE BILL

00:40:29.026 --> 00:40:30.895
WILL ALSO CREATE MORE

00:40:30.961 --> 00:40:32.763
TRANSPARENCY. I WANT TO SAY THAT

00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:34.999
I'M VERY PLEASED THAT WE WERE

00:40:35.065 --> 00:40:37.701
ABLE TO WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR,

00:40:37.768 --> 00:40:38.369
WITH THE ADMINISTRATION, SO THAT

00:40:38.435 --> 00:40:40.271
THE LICENSURE PIECE OF THIS BILL

00:40:40.337 --> 00:40:41.438
WAS PASSED AS PART OF THE

00:40:41.505 --> 00:40:42.973
BUDGET, AND THAT CAN NOW THAT'S

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:47.344
NOW UNDERWAY. AND NOW IT'S TIME

00:40:47.411 --> 00:40:48.746
TO ADDRESS THE PRACTICES THAT

00:40:48.813 --> 00:40:50.314
ARE CAUSING SO MANY PROBLEMS IN

00:40:50.381 --> 00:40:52.416
THE HEALTH SECTOR. I

00:40:52.483 --> 00:40:56.520
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

00:40:56.587 --> 00:40:59.056
AND WITH ME TODAY, TESTIFY IS

00:40:59.123 --> 00:41:01.225
OUR TWO PHARMACIST, CLINT

00:41:01.292 --> 00:41:02.993
HOPKINS, THE OWNER OF PUCCI'S

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:04.361
PHARMACY HERE IN SACRAMENTO, AND

00:41:04.428 --> 00:41:07.698
SONIA FRAUSTO, OWNER OF TEN

00:41:07.765 --> 00:41:09.533
ACRES PHARMACY. THANK YOU. BEGIN

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:10.568
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. GOOD

00:41:10.634 --> 00:41:11.902
MORNING, MR. CHAIR AND MEMBERS.

00:41:11.969 --> 00:41:13.204
I'M DOCTOR CLINT HOPKINS,

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:14.238
PHARMACIST, OWNER OF PUCCI'S

00:41:14.305 --> 00:41:15.673
PHARMACY, INDEPENDENTLY OWNED IN

00:41:15.739 --> 00:41:17.575
SACRAMENTO SINCE 1930. PBMS AND

00:41:17.641 --> 00:41:19.009
HEALTH PLANS, THE PHARMACY DOWN

00:41:19.076 --> 00:41:20.211
THE STREET, THE MAIL ORDER

00:41:20.277 --> 00:41:21.846
PHARMACY TO WHERE THEY STEER

00:41:21.912 --> 00:41:22.379
PATIENTS AND THEY DICTATE

00:41:22.446 --> 00:41:23.781
CONTRACTS WHICH UNDERPAY AND

00:41:23.848 --> 00:41:24.982
FORCE PHARMACIES TO CLOSE.

00:41:25.049 --> 00:41:26.417
MULTIPLE STATE AND FEDERAL

00:41:26.483 --> 00:41:27.718
INVESTIGATIONS HAVE EXPOSED THIS

00:41:27.785 --> 00:41:29.353
FINANCIALLY IRRESPONSIBLE

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:30.721
INDUSTRY. OUR OWN MEDI-CAL,

00:41:30.788 --> 00:41:32.056
WHICH WENT TO A PASS THROUGH

00:41:32.122 --> 00:41:33.490
MODEL, IS A SHINING EXAMPLE OF

00:41:33.557 --> 00:41:35.359
REINING IN PBM ABUSE. EVEN

00:41:35.426 --> 00:41:36.527
BEFORE THE RITE AID CLOSURES,

00:41:36.594 --> 00:41:37.828
NUMEROUS COMMUNITY PHARMACIES

00:41:37.895 --> 00:41:38.529
WERE CLOSING AND CREATING

00:41:38.596 --> 00:41:40.130
PHARMACY DESERTS. WHEN THEIR

00:41:40.197 --> 00:41:41.899
PATIENTS COME TO US, WE OFTEN

00:41:41.966 --> 00:41:43.467
HAVE TO EXPLAIN THAT THEIR DRUGS

00:41:43.534 --> 00:41:45.669
ARE REIMBURSED BELOW ACQUISITION

00:41:45.736 --> 00:41:47.004
COSTS, LIKELY THE REASON THAT

00:41:47.071 --> 00:41:47.872
THEIR PREVIOUS PHARMACY CLOSED

00:41:47.938 --> 00:41:49.874
EACH DAY. IT SEEMS WE SPEND MORE

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:50.941
TIME EXPLAINING TO PATIENTS WHY

00:41:51.008 --> 00:41:52.843
WE CANNOT HELP THEM THAN WE DO

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:54.778
COUNSELING PATIENTS, ACTUALLY

00:41:54.845 --> 00:41:55.412
PICKING UP MEDICATIONS FROM OUR

00:41:55.479 --> 00:41:56.247
PHARMACY. PBMS LIMIT WHICH DRUGS

00:41:56.313 --> 00:41:57.014
CAN BE DISPENSED LOCALLY AND

00:41:57.081 --> 00:41:57.982
RESERVE THE MOST PROFITABLE

00:41:58.048 --> 00:41:59.750
DRUGS FOR THEIR OWN PHARMACIES.

00:41:59.817 --> 00:42:00.251
JUST LAST WEEK, WE WERE

00:42:00.317 --> 00:42:02.786
CONTACTED BY A PATIENT WHO WAS

00:42:02.853 --> 00:42:03.721
FORCED TO USE THE PBM OWNED

00:42:03.787 --> 00:42:04.822
PHARMACY FOR A SPECIALTY

00:42:04.889 --> 00:42:05.623
MEDICATION. HE'S A FEDERAL

00:42:05.689 --> 00:42:07.124
EMPLOYEE FORCED TO USE MAIL

00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:08.158
ORDER BY CAREMARK, WHO MANAGES

00:42:08.225 --> 00:42:09.627
THE BENEFITS FOR FEDERAL

00:42:09.693 --> 00:42:11.228
EMPLOYEES. HIS MED IS A GENERIC

00:42:11.295 --> 00:42:12.096
THAT DOESN'T COST VERY MUCH.

00:42:12.162 --> 00:42:14.098
HE'S NOT HAPPY WITH THE MAIL

00:42:14.164 --> 00:42:15.466
SERVICE. HE'S RUN OUT OF MEDS

00:42:15.532 --> 00:42:16.834
MULTIPLE TIMES DUE TO THEIR

00:42:16.901 --> 00:42:17.368
DELAYS, MISSING DOSES AND

00:42:17.434 --> 00:42:19.770
PUTTING HIM AT RISK OF A

00:42:19.837 --> 00:42:20.271
DISEASE, WHICH COULD BE

00:42:20.337 --> 00:42:21.405
PREVENTED BY ALLOWING HIM LOCAL

00:42:21.472 --> 00:42:22.172
ACCESS. AND THE KICKER? THEY'VE

00:42:22.239 --> 00:42:23.941
BEEN CHARGING HIM $60 EACH MONTH

00:42:24.008 --> 00:42:26.410
WHEN HE COULD HAVE JUST PAID $50

00:42:26.477 --> 00:42:27.711
OUT OF POCKET FOR THIS SPECIALTY

00:42:27.778 --> 00:42:28.679
MEDICATION FROM A LOCAL

00:42:28.746 --> 00:42:29.780
PHARMACY, AND HAD THE MED THE

00:42:29.847 --> 00:42:31.482
SAME DAY. THE WEEK BEFORE, A

00:42:31.548 --> 00:42:33.250
CHILD OF EIGHT MONTHS OLD WAS

00:42:33.317 --> 00:42:34.218
FORCED TO USE SPECIALTY PHARMACY

00:42:34.285 --> 00:42:35.552
FOR THEIR MED. THE AVERAGE

00:42:35.619 --> 00:42:37.354
PHARMACY WOULD CHARGE $120 FOR A

00:42:37.421 --> 00:42:39.089
BOTTLE OF THIS MED. CVS MAIL

00:42:39.156 --> 00:42:40.324
ORDER WILL LIKELY PAY THEMSELVES

00:42:40.391 --> 00:42:42.393
IN EXCESS OF 1300 FOR THE SAME

00:42:42.459 --> 00:42:44.428
DRUG SITTING ON THE SHELF IN MY

00:42:44.495 --> 00:42:45.195
PHARMACY, AND HER PARENTS HAD TO

00:42:45.262 --> 00:42:47.965
WAIT FOR NO REASON OTHER THAN

00:42:48.032 --> 00:42:48.799
PROFIT. THE OPPOSITION HAS CITED

00:42:48.866 --> 00:42:50.134
THAT THEY PAY SOME PHARMACIES

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:52.002
MORE THAN THEY PAY THAN THEY PAY

00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:53.904
THEIR OWN. I CHALLENGE THEM TO

00:42:53.971 --> 00:42:54.538
BRING SUCH A PHARMACY FORWARD,

00:42:54.605 --> 00:42:55.940
TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY. BUT YOU'LL

00:42:56.006 --> 00:42:57.374
BE MORE LIKELY TO MEET THE

00:42:57.441 --> 00:42:59.143
MUFFIN MAN. YES, THE ONE THAT

00:42:59.209 --> 00:43:00.177
LIVES ON DRURY LANE. THEN YOU

00:43:00.244 --> 00:43:01.879
WILL. BECAUSE SUCH A PHARMACIST.

00:43:01.946 --> 00:43:02.846
BECAUSE BOTH ONLY EXIST IN FAIRY

00:43:02.913 --> 00:43:06.517
TALES. I WITHOUT SB 41, PBMS

00:43:06.583 --> 00:43:08.285
WILL CONTINUE TO RUN AFOUL,

00:43:08.352 --> 00:43:09.219
CAUSING MORE PHARMACIES TO

00:43:09.286 --> 00:43:10.821
CLOSE, LOCAL JOBS TO BE LOST AND

00:43:10.888 --> 00:43:12.656
PATIENTS TO LOSE ACCESS TO

00:43:12.723 --> 00:43:13.490
HEALTH CARE IN THEIR

00:43:13.557 --> 00:43:15.125
COMMUNITIES. FOR FAR TOO LONG,

00:43:15.192 --> 00:43:16.026
PBMS HAVE OPERATED IN THE

00:43:16.093 --> 00:43:16.660
SHADOWS, EXTRACTING EXORBITANT

00:43:16.727 --> 00:43:18.128
AMOUNTS OF MONEY FROM THE SYSTEM

00:43:18.195 --> 00:43:20.197
THEY'VE DESIGNED. I RESPECTFULLY

00:43:20.264 --> 00:43:21.098
REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB 41.

00:43:21.165 --> 00:43:24.101
THANK YOU. WOW. I DON'T HAVE A

00:43:24.168 --> 00:43:26.670
MUFFIN, MAN, BUT MY NAME IS

00:43:26.737 --> 00:43:28.472
SONIA FRAUSTO. I'M THE OWNER OF

00:43:28.539 --> 00:43:31.275
TEN ACRES PHARMACY. LAST WEEK WE

00:43:31.342 --> 00:43:32.076
TESTIFIED. I'M SORRY. I'M GOING

00:43:32.142 --> 00:43:33.310
TO BE PRETTY EMOTIONAL BECAUSE I

00:43:33.377 --> 00:43:35.112
JUST ANNOUNCED MY PHARMACY WILL

00:43:35.179 --> 00:43:37.848
BE CLOSING ON AUGUST 20TH. AND

00:43:37.915 --> 00:43:39.917
NOT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A LOT

00:43:39.984 --> 00:43:41.685
OF PATIENTS. WE'VE GROWN

00:43:41.752 --> 00:43:43.721
TREMENDOUSLY, BUT BECAUSE I

00:43:43.787 --> 00:43:46.724
CAN'T AFFORD TO KEEP OPEN OUR

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:49.193
PHARMACY PRACTICES. COMPASSION

00:43:49.259 --> 00:43:51.462
AND HONESTY AND TRANSPARENCY

00:43:51.528 --> 00:43:53.197
WITH ALL OF OUR PATIENTS. WE'VE

00:43:53.263 --> 00:43:54.331
HAD FIVE PHARMACIES CLOSED

00:43:54.398 --> 00:43:56.433
WITHIN A FIVE MILE RADIUS. WE'VE

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:57.968
ABSORBED A LOT OF THOSE

00:43:58.035 --> 00:43:59.370
PATIENTS, AND SOMETIMES I HAVE

00:43:59.436 --> 00:44:00.838
TO TURN PATIENTS AWAY BECAUSE I

00:44:00.904 --> 00:44:02.573
CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE THEIR

00:44:02.639 --> 00:44:04.041
MEDICATIONS BECAUSE I'M

00:44:04.108 --> 00:44:06.176
UNDERPAID. SIGNIFICANTLY, LAST

00:44:06.243 --> 00:44:08.946
WEEK I TOLD MY PATIENTS, EXCUSE

00:44:09.013 --> 00:44:11.615
ME? I TOLD MY STAFF AND THEY

00:44:11.682 --> 00:44:12.116
WERE HEARTBROKEN BECAUSE

00:44:12.182 --> 00:44:13.851
OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE LOSING JOBS. I

00:44:13.917 --> 00:44:15.686
TESTIFIED LAST TUESDAY. I

00:44:15.753 --> 00:44:17.321
COMPLETELY LOST IT LIKE THIS

00:44:17.388 --> 00:44:18.655
BECAUSE I KNEW WHAT I WAS GOING

00:44:18.722 --> 00:44:20.657
TO HAVE TO DO THIS WEEK.

00:44:20.724 --> 00:44:22.159
YESTERDAY, I HAD TO TELL MY

00:44:22.226 --> 00:44:23.994
PATIENTS AND THE OUTPOURING OF

00:44:24.061 --> 00:44:25.996
LOVE AND SUPPORT WAS TREMENDOUS.

00:44:26.063 --> 00:44:27.798
THEY TRIED TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE

00:44:27.865 --> 00:44:29.099
COULD STAY OPEN BAKE SALES,

00:44:29.166 --> 00:44:30.134
LEMONADE STANDS, YOU NAME IT. I

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:32.302
THINK I HAD A REALLY HIGH

00:44:32.369 --> 00:44:32.803
SUCCESSFUL SELL THROUGH

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:34.338
YESTERDAY, BUT THE REALITY WAS,

00:44:34.405 --> 00:44:36.106
IS THAT I HAD PATIENTS THAT HAD

00:44:36.173 --> 00:44:37.141
JUST TRANSFERRED FROM RITE AID

00:44:37.207 --> 00:44:39.276
WHO HAD CLOSED THEIR DOORS JUST

00:44:39.343 --> 00:44:41.845
WEEKS AGO AND, AND FOUND ME AND

00:44:41.912 --> 00:44:44.581
WERE SO HAPPY. AND THEN I HAD TO

00:44:44.648 --> 00:44:45.916
TELL THEM YESTERDAY THAT I CAN

00:44:45.983 --> 00:44:47.317
NO LONGER SERVE THEM BECAUSE WE

00:44:47.384 --> 00:44:49.153
WILL ALSO BE CLOSING ON 820.

00:44:49.219 --> 00:44:51.255
THIS IS AWFUL, BECAUSE NOT ONLY

00:44:51.321 --> 00:44:53.657
AM I A PHARMACIST WHO PROVIDES

00:44:53.724 --> 00:44:54.858
HEALTH CARE, I'M A FRIEND TO A

00:44:54.925 --> 00:44:56.193
LOT OF THESE PATIENTS THAT COME

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:57.761
IN. I'VE SEEN PATIENTS HAVE

00:44:57.828 --> 00:44:58.762
BABIES AND THEIR KIDS COME TO

00:44:58.829 --> 00:45:00.964
OUR PHARMACY, HAVE GOOD

00:45:01.031 --> 00:45:01.965
RELATIONSHIPS WITH A PHARMACIST.

00:45:02.032 --> 00:45:03.100
THAT'S SOMETIMES YOUR FIRST

00:45:03.167 --> 00:45:05.169
HEALTH CARE RELATIONSHIP. AND TO

00:45:05.235 --> 00:45:07.438
SEE THAT GO AWAY IN A COMMUNITY

00:45:07.504 --> 00:45:08.839
THAT DESPERATELY NEEDS A

00:45:08.906 --> 00:45:11.075
PHARMACY IS OUTRAGEOUS. I HAVE

00:45:11.141 --> 00:45:13.177
STUDENTS WHO DREAM OF OPENING A

00:45:13.243 --> 00:45:14.278
PHARMACY AND CALLED ME THIS

00:45:14.344 --> 00:45:16.046
WEEKEND AND ASKED ME WHAT WAS I

00:45:16.113 --> 00:45:17.448
THINKING? WHY COULD I NOT

00:45:17.514 --> 00:45:19.883
SURVIVE? AND I HAD TO BE HONEST

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:21.385
WITH THEM AND TELL THEM THAT IT

00:45:21.452 --> 00:45:23.420
IS BECAUSE I AM UNDER REIMBURSED

00:45:23.487 --> 00:45:26.223
CONSISTENTLY FROM THESE PBMS. I

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:27.791
CAN'T EVEN MAKE PAYROLL

00:45:27.858 --> 00:45:31.195

OPPOSITION TO SB 41, IT'S WORTH

NOTING THAT SB 41 IS LARGELY A

00:48:39.182 --> 00:48:41.184
REINTRODUCTION OF SB 966, WHICH

00:48:41.251 --> 00:48:42.853
WAS PASSED BY THIS LEGISLATURE,

00:48:42.919 --> 00:48:44.621
WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR, WITH

00:48:44.688 --> 00:48:46.056
THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE

00:48:46.123 --> 00:48:47.824

00:48:51.461 --> 00:48:54.598
BE SOME FOCUS ON PBMS. THIS

00:48:54.665 --> 00:48:56.199
LEGISLATURE HELPED HIM ACHIEVE

00:48:56.266 --> 00:48:58.435
THOSE GOALS WITH THE PASSAGE OF

00:48:58.502 --> 00:49:00.570
AB 116 JUST TWO WEEKS AGO THAT

00:49:00.637 --> 00:49:02.205
WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. THAT WILL

00:49:02.272 --> 00:49:04.608
NOW REQUIRE PBMS TO BE LICENSED

THIS LEGISLATURE HAS A LOT OF

00:49:25.228 --> 00:49:27.798
INTEREST IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT

00:49:27.864 --> 00:49:29.766
SOON. COME 2026, THIS

00:49:29.833 --> 00:49:31.301
LEGISLATURE WILL BE ARMED WITH

00:49:31.368 --> 00:49:33.370

00:49:33.437 --> 00:49:34.905
END TO THE FINGER POINTING YOU

00:49:34.971 --> 00:49:37.107

00:49:44.214 --> 00:49:47.284
SOUND POLICY DECISION. SB 41

00:49:47.351 --> 00:49:50.454
STEPS IN AND IGNORES THE

00:49:54.124 --> 00:49:56.793
MAKES POLICY DECISIONS THAT TAKE

00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:58.695
AWAY PBM TOOLS AND LIMIT CLIENT

00:49:58.762 --> 00:50:01.565
CHOICE. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THIS

00:50:01.631 --> 00:50:04.101
COMMITTEE KNOW THAT CLIENTS, PBM

00:50:04.167 --> 00:50:06.970
CLIENTS BEING THE STATE LARGE

00:50:07.037 --> 00:50:08.438
EMPLOYERS, SMALL EMPLOYERS,

00:50:08.505 --> 00:50:11.274
UNION TRUSTS DO NOT HAVE TO USE

00:50:11.341 --> 00:50:13.810
PBMS. THEY CHOOSE TO USE PBMS

00:50:13.877 --> 00:50:15.612
BECAUSE THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL IN

00:50:15.679 --> 00:50:17.581
NEGOTIATING LOWER DRUG PRICES

00:50:17.647 --> 00:50:19.483
AND PUTTING TOGETHER PHARMACY

00:50:19.549 --> 00:50:21.251
NETWORKS AND PHARMACY BENEFITS

00:50:21.318 --> 00:50:23.053
THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE TO THEIR

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:24.621
EMPLOYEES AND MEMBERS AT THE

00:50:24.688 --> 00:50:27.791
MOST AFFORDABLE PRICE. WE

00:50:27.858 --> 00:50:29.593
ACKNOWLEDGE THE VALUE AND THE

00:50:29.659 --> 00:50:31.161
IMPORTANCE OF INDEPENDENT

00:50:31.228 --> 00:50:33.296
PHARMACIES. PBMS CANNOT CREATE

00:50:33.363 --> 00:50:35.065
NETWORKS WITHOUT THEM, AND WE

00:50:35.132 --> 00:50:36.867
ARE OPEN TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS.

00:50:36.933 --> 00:50:39.369
BUT SB 41 IS NOT GOING TO DO

00:50:39.436 --> 00:50:40.771
ANYTHING TO LOWER THE PRICE OF

00:50:40.837 --> 00:50:41.938
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR

00:50:42.005 --> 00:50:43.774
CONSUMERS. FOR THAT REASON, WE

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:46.576
ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU,

00:50:46.643 --> 00:50:47.944
MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JOHN WINGER

00:50:48.011 --> 00:50:49.279
HERE ON BEHALF OF AMERICA'S

00:50:49.346 --> 00:50:50.313
HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS, WE'RE

00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:51.848
THE NATIONAL TRADE ASSOCIATION

00:50:51.915 --> 00:50:54.518
FOR THE HEALTH PLANS, I THINK TO

00:50:54.584 --> 00:50:56.420
PMA'S POINT, WILLING TO HAVE

00:50:56.486 --> 00:50:57.421
THAT CONVERSATION ABOUT

00:50:57.487 --> 00:50:59.055
PHARMACY. OBVIOUSLY, WE HAVE TO

00:50:59.122 --> 00:51:00.624
HAVE ADEQUATE NETWORKS, AND

00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:02.159
PHARMACIES ARE AN IMPORTANT

00:51:02.225 --> 00:51:03.059
COMPONENT OF THAT. AND SO

00:51:03.126 --> 00:51:04.628
WILLING TO HAVE THOSE

00:51:04.694 --> 00:51:05.462
DISCUSSIONS, NOT GOING TO

00:51:05.529 --> 00:51:06.596
RELITIGATE EVERYTHING THAT WAS

00:51:06.663 --> 00:51:07.731
DISCUSSED IN HEALTH COMMITTEE.

00:51:07.798 --> 00:51:10.000
BUT THERE ARE THERE ARE A LOT OF

00:51:10.066 --> 00:51:11.635
PROVISIONS OF THE BILL RELATED

00:51:11.701 --> 00:51:13.136
TO THE MANUFACTURERS AND TAKING

00:51:13.203 --> 00:51:15.172
AWAY TOOLS IN THE TOOL CHEST

00:51:15.238 --> 00:51:17.507
FROM PBMS PERSPECTIVE, IN ORDER

00:51:17.574 --> 00:51:19.142
TO REDUCE THE COST OF DRUGS,

00:51:19.209 --> 00:51:20.644
WHICH HAS AN IMPACT ON PAYERS

00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:23.647
WHO VOLUNTARILY HIRE THEM. BUT

00:51:23.713 --> 00:51:25.482
SPECIFIC TO, I THINK, THIS

00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:27.484
COMMITTEE, OUR BIGGEST CONCERN

00:51:27.551 --> 00:51:29.753
WITH THE BILL IS AROUND ERISA

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:31.721
PREEMPTION. THE SUPREME COURT

00:51:31.788 --> 00:51:34.391
RULED IN 2020 THAT A LOT OF THE

00:51:34.458 --> 00:51:35.826
PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL WOULD BE

00:51:35.892 --> 00:51:38.128
PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL LAW.

00:51:38.195 --> 00:51:40.597
ANYTHING THAT GETS INTO THE

00:51:40.664 --> 00:51:41.965
ACTUAL HEALTH PLAN

00:51:42.032 --> 00:51:43.133
ADMINISTRATION AND IS DIRECTLY

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:44.935
RELATED TO THE HEALTH PLANS

00:51:45.001 --> 00:51:46.703
BENEFIT DESIGN IS PREEMPTED

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:48.472
UNDER ERISA. THERE WERE SOME

00:51:48.538 --> 00:51:50.340
VERY NARROW EXCEPTIONS TO THAT

00:51:50.407 --> 00:51:52.108
THAT WERE NOT PREEMPTED BY

00:51:52.175 --> 00:51:53.777
ERISA, THAT THE STATE COULD DO

00:51:53.844 --> 00:51:54.911
RELATED TO PHARMACY

00:51:54.978 --> 00:51:56.480
REIMBURSEMENT AND A COUPLE OTHER

00:51:56.546 --> 00:51:58.448
THINGS. BUT THIS BILL GOES WELL

00:51:58.515 --> 00:52:00.283
BEYOND THAT. THERE'S BEEN RECENT

00:52:00.350 --> 00:52:01.384
LITIGATION IN THE 10TH CIRCUIT

00:52:01.451 --> 00:52:02.986
AS WELL. THAT'S ALSO REAFFIRMED

00:52:03.053 --> 00:52:04.855
THIS. AND SO WE CONTINUE TO

00:52:04.921 --> 00:52:06.056
BELIEVE THAT THE INCLUSION OF

00:52:06.122 --> 00:52:08.492
SELF-INSURED PLANS IN THE BILL

00:52:08.558 --> 00:52:10.727
IS GOING TO BE PREEMPTED BY

00:52:10.794 --> 00:52:13.730
ERISA. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IS

00:52:13.797 --> 00:52:15.765
THERE ANYONE ELSE HERE IN

00:52:15.832 --> 00:52:19.135
OPPOSITION TO SB 41? WE'LL BRING

00:52:19.202 --> 00:52:21.104
IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. ANY

00:52:21.171 --> 00:52:23.006
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS? MADAM

00:52:23.073 --> 00:52:26.176
VICE CHAIR? THANK YOU, MR.

00:52:26.243 --> 00:52:27.744
CHAIR. THANK YOU, SENATOR, FOR

00:52:27.811 --> 00:52:29.112
BRINGING THIS FORWARD. AGAIN, A

00:52:29.179 --> 00:52:30.614
COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:31.414
CLARIFICATION. COULD YOU EXPLAIN

00:52:31.481 --> 00:52:34.651
HOW THIS BILL IS DIFFERENT? I

00:52:34.718 --> 00:52:35.285
SUPPORTED LAST YEAR'S BILL. SO

00:52:35.352 --> 00:52:38.622
WHAT'S DIFFERENT THIS YEAR? IT'S

00:52:38.688 --> 00:52:41.258
SIMILAR TO LAST YEAR. ENORMOUS

00:52:41.324 --> 00:52:42.893
RESPECT FOR THE GOVERNOR. AND HE

00:52:42.959 --> 00:52:44.995
HAS THE RIGHT TO VETO A BILL.

00:52:45.061 --> 00:52:46.663
BUT THIS IS A BILL THAT YOU'LL

00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:48.565
RECALL PASSED WITH ALMOST

00:52:48.632 --> 00:52:50.734
UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:53.937
LAST YEAR. AND WE ARE I'M REALLY

00:52:54.004 --> 00:52:55.739
GRATEFUL THAT THE GOVERNOR

00:52:55.805 --> 00:52:57.374
WORKED WITH US IN THE BUDGET TO

00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:59.376
PUT THE LICENSURE PIECE IN THE

00:52:59.442 --> 00:53:01.511
BUDGET. I THINK THAT WAS A STEP

00:53:01.578 --> 00:53:03.146
FORWARD, AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO

00:53:03.213 --> 00:53:05.582
WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR AND

00:53:05.649 --> 00:53:06.917
HAVING DIALOG WITH THE

00:53:06.983 --> 00:53:08.084
ADMINISTRATION ABOUT THE DETAILS

00:53:08.151 --> 00:53:10.554
OF THE BILL. I DO JUST WANT TO

00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:12.389
RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THE

00:53:12.455 --> 00:53:13.023
CHARACTERIZATION OF THE BUDGET

00:53:13.089 --> 00:53:15.125
TRAILER BILL, THE LICENSURE

00:53:15.191 --> 00:53:16.259
PIECE THAT GOT PUT INTO THE

00:53:16.326 --> 00:53:18.662
BUDGET TRAILER BILL WAS NOT IN

00:53:18.728 --> 00:53:21.197
LIEU OF REGULATION. IT A PIECE

00:53:21.264 --> 00:53:24.434
OF SB 41, AND IT WAS PLACED INTO

00:53:24.501 --> 00:53:26.770
THE BUDGET BECAUSE THAT MEANS

00:53:26.836 --> 00:53:29.139
THAT THE LICENSURE CAN BE STOOD

00:53:29.205 --> 00:53:30.774
UP. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S

00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:32.709
GRAMMATICALLY CORRECT. WE STOOD

00:53:32.776 --> 00:53:34.644
UP MORE QUICKLY, OTHERWISE WE'D

00:53:34.711 --> 00:53:36.513
HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL NEXT FISCAL

00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:38.615
YEAR TO STAND IT UP. SO BY

00:53:38.682 --> 00:53:39.816
PUTTING INTO THE BUDGET, THEY

00:53:39.883 --> 00:53:41.518
CAN GET TO WORK IMMEDIATELY IN

00:53:41.585 --> 00:53:42.452
GETTING LICENSURE IN PLACE. AND

00:53:42.519 --> 00:53:44.354
SO ONCE THE RULES ARE PASSED AND

00:53:44.421 --> 00:53:46.523
GO INTO EFFECT JANUARY 1ST,

00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:47.991
THEY'LL BE READY TO GO. SO

00:53:48.058 --> 00:53:50.160
THEY'RE COMPLEMENTARY. THEY'RE

00:53:50.226 --> 00:53:50.827
COMPLEMENTARY. THEY WORK

00:53:50.894 --> 00:53:52.028
TOGETHER. AND THEN IF YOU COULD

00:53:52.095 --> 00:53:53.463
ALSO ADDRESS THE ERISA ISSUE

00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:55.899
PLEASE. YEAH WE DISAGREE. AND IN

00:53:55.966 --> 00:53:57.901
FACT THERE WAS A SUPREME COURT

00:53:57.968 --> 00:54:01.137
CASE OUT OF ARKANSAS THAT UPHELD

00:54:01.204 --> 00:54:03.707
STATE LEVEL PBM REGULATION. THAT

00:54:03.773 --> 00:54:05.909
BILL WAS NOT EXACTLY THE SAME AS

00:54:05.976 --> 00:54:08.378
THIS BILL. BUT WE DO NOT. WE

00:54:08.445 --> 00:54:09.112
UNDERSTAND THAT'S THEIR

00:54:09.179 --> 00:54:11.014
ARGUMENT. AND THEY HAVE EVERY

00:54:11.081 --> 00:54:12.315
RIGHT TO RAISE THAT ARGUMENT

00:54:12.382 --> 00:54:14.584
HERE OR IN COURT. BUT WE

00:54:14.651 --> 00:54:15.685
DISAGREE WITH THEIR LEGAL

00:54:15.752 --> 00:54:17.087
ANALYSIS. AND THEN ONE FINAL

00:54:17.153 --> 00:54:18.054
QUESTION. OTHER STATES, I MEAN,

00:54:18.121 --> 00:54:20.357
HOW DOES THIS AFFECT THE

00:54:20.423 --> 00:54:21.291
INDUSTRY AND WORKING THROUGH

00:54:21.358 --> 00:54:22.559
PBMS OF OTHER STATES TAKING

00:54:22.626 --> 00:54:23.793
SIMILAR ACTION? YEAH, OTHER

00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:26.062
STATES HAVE ENACTED REGULATIONS.

00:54:26.129 --> 00:54:28.832
CALIFORNIA IS A BIT BEHIND HERE.

00:54:28.898 --> 00:54:30.634
I WILL ALSO SAY THERE IS

00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:33.169
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN CONGRESS

00:54:33.236 --> 00:54:36.106
TO REGULATE PBMS. THIS IS NOT A

00:54:36.172 --> 00:54:38.008
NOT A VERY CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE

00:54:38.074 --> 00:54:41.444
AMONG POLICYMAKERS. YOU KNOW, I,

00:54:41.511 --> 00:54:43.747
I HOPE THAT AT SOME POINT

00:54:43.813 --> 00:54:45.515
CONGRESS DOES THAT, BUT THEY

00:54:45.582 --> 00:54:47.417
HAVEN'T YET. BUT BUT THERE HAS

00:54:47.484 --> 00:54:48.785
BEEN BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. WELL

00:54:48.852 --> 00:54:53.790
VERY GOOD. AND JUST MY EMPATHY

00:54:53.857 --> 00:54:55.625
FOR INDEPENDENT PHARMACIES. AND

00:54:55.692 --> 00:54:57.861
I HAVE THEM IN MY OWN COMMUNITY.

00:54:57.927 --> 00:54:59.195
AND I HAD NO IDEA WHEN I WHEN

00:54:59.262 --> 00:55:02.065
YOU HAD YOUR BILL LAST YEAR, I

00:55:02.132 --> 00:55:03.299
WENT AROUND AND VISITED

00:55:03.366 --> 00:55:03.933
INDEPENDENT PHARMACIES AND IN

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.168
VARIOUS PARTS OF ORANGE COUNTY,

00:55:05.235 --> 00:55:07.137
WHAT I REPRESENT. AND I WAS

00:55:07.203 --> 00:55:08.238
SHOCKED BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW

00:55:08.304 --> 00:55:10.273
AND IT WAS A BIG EDUCATION. WHAT

00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:11.207
WE'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH AND

00:55:11.274 --> 00:55:12.842
LAST YEAR WAS VERY CONFUSING.

00:55:12.909 --> 00:55:14.177
NOW I UNDERSTAND IT A LOT MORE,

00:55:14.244 --> 00:55:15.779
A LOT MORE CLEARLY, AND I'M

00:55:15.845 --> 00:55:18.648
FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR BILL

00:55:18.715 --> 00:55:20.350
AND WISH YOU SUCCESS IN HERE. I

00:55:20.417 --> 00:55:22.218
MEAN, I MY HEART GOES OUT TO THE

00:55:22.285 --> 00:55:23.353
INDEPENDENT PHARMACIST. IT'S

00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:24.287
JUST HEARTBREAKING TO SEE THAT

00:55:24.354 --> 00:55:26.222
THEY CAN'T AFFORD PAYROLL

00:55:26.289 --> 00:55:28.058
BECAUSE OF THE PRICE OF DRUGS.

00:55:28.124 --> 00:55:30.126
THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE

00:55:30.193 --> 00:55:32.629
IT. THANK YOU CHAIR. THANK YOU,

00:55:32.696 --> 00:55:34.097
ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAPIN. GOOD

00:55:34.164 --> 00:55:35.965
MORNING. GOOD MORNING. I FEEL

00:55:36.032 --> 00:55:38.435
LIKE WE SEE EACH OTHER QUITE

00:55:38.501 --> 00:55:39.869
REGULARLY. I WANT TO THANK YOU,

00:55:39.936 --> 00:55:40.904
SENATOR WIENER, FOR BRINGING

00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:42.439
THIS BILL AND FOR YOUR CONTINUED

00:55:42.505 --> 00:55:43.840
LEADERSHIP ON THE ISSUE. AS YOU

00:55:43.907 --> 00:55:46.676
KNOW, MY DISTRICT HAS A LOT OF

00:55:46.743 --> 00:55:48.578
BIOTECH IN IT. I WOULD LIKE TO

00:55:48.645 --> 00:55:51.014
SAY THAT WE ARE THE BIOTECH

00:55:51.081 --> 00:55:51.848
CAPITAL OF THE WORLD, AND I'M

00:55:51.915 --> 00:55:53.216
VERY PROUD OF THAT. AND AS YOU

00:55:53.283 --> 00:55:55.351
WELL KNOW, THESE INNOVATORS ARE

00:55:55.418 --> 00:55:56.853
DISCOVERING NEW CURES EVERY

00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:59.322
SINGLE DAY. AND I THINK THAT

00:55:59.389 --> 00:56:00.523
THEIR SUCCESS AND OUR ACCESS TO

00:56:00.590 --> 00:56:03.226
THOSE CURES DEPENDS UPON

00:56:03.293 --> 00:56:05.061
SCIENTIFIC FAIRNESS, SCIENTIFIC

00:56:05.128 --> 00:56:07.163
MERIT AND FAIRNESS IN PRICING.

00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:10.233
SO THAT'S WHY I'M A FAN OF THE

00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:12.669
BILL. I JUST THINK THAT THE WAY

00:56:12.736 --> 00:56:14.704
IT'S SET UP NOW, PBMS ACTUALLY

00:56:14.771 --> 00:56:16.439
PUNISH COMPANIES FOR HAVING

00:56:16.506 --> 00:56:18.842
LOWER PRICES. AND MY HEART GOES

00:56:18.908 --> 00:56:20.677
OUT TO YOU, INDEPENDENT FOLKS.

00:56:20.744 --> 00:56:25.248
YOU YOU ARE SO PERSONABLE,

00:56:25.315 --> 00:56:26.516
PERSONAL IN HOW YOU CONDUCT YOUR

00:56:26.583 --> 00:56:27.884
BUSINESS. AND IT IS A VERY

00:56:27.951 --> 00:56:29.052
PERSONAL BUSINESS IN A LOT OF

00:56:29.119 --> 00:56:31.187
WAYS. SO I THINK JUST TO DIGRESS

00:56:31.254 --> 00:56:33.890
A MOMENT, I THANK YOU FOR YOUR

00:56:33.957 --> 00:56:34.524
EFFORTS IN THAT REGARD. IT IS

00:56:34.591 --> 00:56:37.093
VERY IMPORTANT TO THE HEALTH AND

00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:38.528
MENTAL HEALTH OF YOUR PATIENTS,

00:56:38.595 --> 00:56:39.929
CERTAINLY TO KNOW WHO'S

00:56:39.996 --> 00:56:41.431
ADMINISTERING THEIR DRUGS. BUT

00:56:41.498 --> 00:56:43.233
IN ANY EVENT, I THINK YOUR YOUR

00:56:43.299 --> 00:56:44.434
BILL IS GOING TO BRING SOME

00:56:44.501 --> 00:56:46.603
DAYLIGHT TO THIS ISSUE AND IT'S

00:56:46.669 --> 00:56:48.471
GOING TO HELP LEVEL THE PLAYING

00:56:48.538 --> 00:56:51.141
FIELD FOR BIOTECH AND GENERIC

00:56:51.207 --> 00:56:51.841
MANUFACTURERS WHO ARE REALLY

00:56:51.908 --> 00:56:53.610
JUST TRYING TO COMPETE. SO I

00:56:53.676 --> 00:56:55.011
HAVE NO QUESTIONS. I JUST WANT

00:56:55.078 --> 00:56:56.312
TO SAY I'M A STRONG SUPPORTER,

00:56:56.379 --> 00:56:57.814
ESPECIALLY GIVEN MY DISTRICT AND

00:56:57.881 --> 00:57:01.017
MY ADMIRATION FOR, FOR

00:57:01.084 --> 00:57:02.051
ESPECIALLY THE INDEPENDENT

00:57:02.118 --> 00:57:05.955
PHARMACIES. ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S.

00:57:06.022 --> 00:57:07.791
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. THANK YOU

00:57:07.857 --> 00:57:09.826
TO THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU TO ALL

00:57:09.893 --> 00:57:10.493
THE WITNESSES. QUESTION TO THE

00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:11.694
AUTHOR JUST ABOUT THE

00:57:11.761 --> 00:57:13.730
CONFIDENTIALITY PROVISIONS. SO

00:57:13.797 --> 00:57:16.232
OBVIOUSLY AB 116 WAS PASSED VERY

00:57:16.299 --> 00:57:17.700
STRICT CONFIDENTIALITY

00:57:17.767 --> 00:57:19.969
PROVISIONS IN THAT BILL. AND NOW

00:57:20.036 --> 00:57:21.771
THIS BILL IS COMING. AND I THINK

00:57:21.838 --> 00:57:23.740
WHAT'S PROBLEMATIC FOR A LOT OF

00:57:23.807 --> 00:57:24.941
US IS THAT UNDER NOW THE

00:57:25.008 --> 00:57:26.276
EXISTING LAW, WHICH I'M NOT SURE

00:57:26.342 --> 00:57:28.678
HOW THIS BILL INTERFACES WITH

00:57:28.745 --> 00:57:31.381
IT, PRIVATE INDUSTRY CAN

00:57:31.447 --> 00:57:33.850
ESSENTIALLY DICTATE WHAT RECORDS

00:57:33.917 --> 00:57:36.119
THAT ARE HELD BY DMHC ARE

00:57:36.186 --> 00:57:37.620
DISCLOSED AS PUBLIC RECORDS OR

00:57:37.687 --> 00:57:40.089
NOT. AND I THINK THAT'S

00:57:40.156 --> 00:57:41.391
PROBLEMATIC. IT'S SORT OF

00:57:41.457 --> 00:57:42.158
UNPRECEDENTED TO HAVE ANY

00:57:42.225 --> 00:57:44.460
PRIVATE INDUSTRY DICTATE WHAT

00:57:44.527 --> 00:57:46.596
RECORDS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAN

00:57:46.663 --> 00:57:49.132
ACCESS TO ACTUALLY PURSUE CASES.

00:57:49.199 --> 00:57:51.801
FOR EXAMPLE, ARE YOU ADDRESSING

00:57:51.868 --> 00:57:53.069
THIS OR ARE YOU COMMITTED TO

00:57:53.136 --> 00:57:54.470
ADDRESSING IT IN THIS BILL? AND

00:57:54.537 --> 00:57:56.840
IF NOT, I'M NOT I'M NOT EXACTLY

00:57:56.906 --> 00:57:59.309
SURE WHY WE ARE ALLOWING THIS

00:57:59.375 --> 00:58:01.611
SORT OF STRICT CONFIDENTIALITY

00:58:01.678 --> 00:58:03.246
TO EXIST IN THIS SPACE WHERE IT

00:58:03.313 --> 00:58:04.781
DOESN'T EXIST IN OTHER SPACES.

00:58:04.848 --> 00:58:06.282
SO CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT AND JUST

00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:08.051
HELP ME LEARN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

00:58:08.117 --> 00:58:10.286
WHY THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN,

00:58:10.353 --> 00:58:11.754
FRANKLY, EVERY AND OBVIOUSLY THE

00:58:11.821 --> 00:58:14.290
CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT

00:58:14.357 --> 00:58:15.358
DICTATES SOMETHING COMPLETELY

00:58:15.425 --> 00:58:16.593
DIFFERENT. AND I THINK WE TALKED

00:58:16.659 --> 00:58:18.228
ABOUT THAT YESTERDAY ON THE

00:58:18.294 --> 00:58:19.929
ASSEMBLY FLOOR. I AM A LITTLE

00:58:19.996 --> 00:58:22.065
WORRIED THAT THIS IS IN

00:58:22.131 --> 00:58:24.434
CONTRADICTION WITH 116 AND WITH

00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:26.769
CPRA NOW. SO CAN YOU JUST SPEAK

00:58:26.836 --> 00:58:28.738
TO THAT FOR ME? YEAH. AND THAT

00:58:28.805 --> 00:58:29.906
WAS ALL NEGOTIATED AS PART OF

00:58:29.973 --> 00:58:32.041
THE PART OF THE BUDGET WITH THE

00:58:32.108 --> 00:58:33.309
ADMINISTRATION. AND THAT IS

00:58:33.376 --> 00:58:34.177
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE

00:58:34.244 --> 00:58:36.346
TAKING A LOOK AT AND WORKING

00:58:36.412 --> 00:58:36.913
WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON.

00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:38.448
OKAY. SO WE ARE COMMITTED TO

00:58:38.514 --> 00:58:39.983
HOPEFULLY, BECAUSE I DO THINK

00:58:40.049 --> 00:58:42.452
THAT THE STAFF ANALYSIS HAS

00:58:42.518 --> 00:58:44.654
PROPOSED, I THINK SOME GOOD

00:58:44.721 --> 00:58:46.789
PATHWAYS FORWARD, MAYBE NOT

00:58:46.856 --> 00:58:48.391
NECESSARILY THROUGH THIS BILL,

00:58:48.458 --> 00:58:50.026
BUT TO ADDRESS THIS, BECAUSE I

00:58:50.093 --> 00:58:51.828
THINK WE YEAH, WE'RE COMMITTED

00:58:51.895 --> 00:58:52.962
TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE

00:58:53.029 --> 00:58:55.231
AND WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO

00:58:55.298 --> 00:58:56.532
RESOLVE THE ISSUE. I APPRECIATE

00:58:56.599 --> 00:58:57.901
THAT. AND THEN I GUESS THE

00:58:57.967 --> 00:58:59.369
SECOND BUCKET OF QUESTIONS I

00:58:59.435 --> 00:59:01.971
HAVE ARE JUST GENERALLY, TO THE

00:59:02.038 --> 00:59:03.273
EXTENT THAT ANYONE UNDERSTANDS

00:59:03.339 --> 00:59:04.807
THIS, THEY ARE SMARTER THAN I

00:59:04.874 --> 00:59:07.310
AM, BECAUSE I WILL SAY THAT THIS

00:59:07.377 --> 00:59:09.612
IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST

00:59:09.679 --> 00:59:10.546
OPAQUE AREAS OF POLICY AND THE

00:59:10.613 --> 00:59:12.048
LAW THAT THAT I'VE ENCOUNTERED

00:59:12.115 --> 00:59:13.816
IN MY SHORT TIME HERE. AND EVEN

00:59:13.883 --> 00:59:15.451
AFTER READING THIS INCREDIBLE

00:59:15.518 --> 00:59:16.953
ANALYSIS AND THE BILL, I STILL

00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:18.888
DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND IT. WHAT

00:59:18.955 --> 00:59:20.390
I AM CONCERNED ABOUT. AND I

00:59:20.456 --> 00:59:22.659
THINK THAT WHAT'S DRIVING THIS

00:59:22.725 --> 00:59:24.661
BILL IS COST, I WOULD HOPE, AND

00:59:24.727 --> 00:59:26.095
TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:59:26.162 --> 00:59:27.263
CONSUMERS ARE PAYING LESS FOR

00:59:27.330 --> 00:59:28.831
THEIR PHARMACEUTICALS AND THEIR

00:59:28.898 --> 00:59:31.034
DRUGS AND NOT MORE. WHAT I'M

00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:32.335
CONCERNED ABOUT IS THIS THIS

00:59:32.402 --> 00:59:36.773
BILL DOESN'T NECESSARILY.

00:59:36.839 --> 00:59:38.574
PREDICT THAT OR INSURE THAT. SO

00:59:38.641 --> 00:59:39.976
I GUESS, IS THERE ANYTHING

00:59:40.043 --> 00:59:41.077
OBVIOUSLY, PHARMACEUTICAL

00:59:41.144 --> 00:59:43.112
COMPANIES DICTATE THE PRICE OF

00:59:43.179 --> 00:59:45.448
THEIR DRUGS, THEIR OF THE

00:59:45.515 --> 00:59:47.650
PHARMACEUTICALS THAT THEY SELL.

00:59:47.717 --> 00:59:50.553
PBMS HAVE THEIR ROLE IN SETTING

00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:52.221
THE ULTIMATE PRICE THAT

00:59:52.288 --> 00:59:54.924
CONSUMERS PAY. AND THIS HAS TO

00:59:54.991 --> 00:59:56.926
DO WITH PBMS. DOES THE BILL HAVE

00:59:56.993 --> 00:59:58.828
ANYTHING TO ENSURE THAT

00:59:58.895 --> 00:59:59.862
CONSUMERS, TO THE EXTENT THAT

00:59:59.929 --> 01:00:01.564
WE'RE SAVING MONEY BY THESE

01:00:01.631 --> 01:00:02.632
REGULATIONS, THE CONSUMER

01:00:02.699 --> 01:00:04.434
ACTUALLY WILL PAY LOWER DRUG

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:05.902
PRICES? OR COULD PHARMACEUTICAL

01:00:05.969 --> 01:00:07.737
COMPANIES JUST RAISE THE PRICES

01:00:07.804 --> 01:00:09.005
OR JUST KEEP ALL THE MONEY

01:00:09.072 --> 01:00:13.209
THAT'S BEING SAVED FROM PBMS? SO

01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:14.143
FIRST OF ALL, I WOULD NEVER

01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:15.912
SUGGEST THAT ONE BILL SOLVES

01:00:15.979 --> 01:00:18.014
EVERY PROBLEM IN TERMS OF THE

01:00:18.081 --> 01:00:19.082
COST OF HEALTH CARE. I NEVER

01:00:19.148 --> 01:00:21.718
HOLD YOU TO THAT HEALTH CARE

01:00:21.784 --> 01:00:22.919
SYSTEM. AND I KNOW YOU'RE NOT

01:00:22.986 --> 01:00:25.922
SUGGESTING THAT. SO IT THERE

01:00:25.989 --> 01:00:28.624
WILL STILL BE NEGOTIATION WITH

01:00:28.691 --> 01:00:30.126
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES,

01:00:30.193 --> 01:00:31.761
REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE

01:00:31.828 --> 01:00:34.230
COMPENSATION STRUCTURE IS FOR

01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:36.132
PBMS. WE KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW,

01:00:36.199 --> 01:00:38.234
PBMS HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO FAVOR

01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:39.469
HIGHER COST DRUGS, BECAUSE THAT

01:00:39.535 --> 01:00:41.804
MEANS THAT THEY GET MORE REBATE

01:00:41.871 --> 01:00:43.773
REVENUE. THE HIGHER THE DRUG

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:44.907
COST, THE HIGHER THE REBATE,

01:00:44.974 --> 01:00:46.743
WHICH IS A PERCENTAGE OF THE

01:00:46.809 --> 01:00:48.511
DRUG COST, AND THE HIGHER THEIR

01:00:48.578 --> 01:00:51.280
CUT OF THAT OF THAT REBATE. IN

01:00:51.347 --> 01:00:53.716
TERMS OF IF YOU HAVE AN OVERALL

01:00:53.783 --> 01:00:55.251
SAVINGS TO THE HEALTH CARE

01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:56.719
SYSTEM, WHENEVER THOSE COSTS GO

01:00:56.786 --> 01:00:59.422
UP, WE ALL PAY MORE THROUGH

01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:03.493
INSURANCE RATES, ETC. AND SO

01:01:03.559 --> 01:01:04.961
WHETHER WHETHER THE CONSUMER IS

01:01:05.028 --> 01:01:07.096
GETTING A DIRECT FINANCIAL

01:01:07.163 --> 01:01:08.631
BENEFIT OR WHETHER THE COSTS ARE

01:01:08.698 --> 01:01:10.066
GOING DOWN IN THE SYSTEM

01:01:10.133 --> 01:01:11.834
OVERALL, IT'S TO THE BENEFIT OF

01:01:11.901 --> 01:01:13.970
EVERYONE. SO ONE WAY OR THE

01:01:14.037 --> 01:01:15.238
OTHER, THERE WILL BE BENEFITS.

01:01:15.304 --> 01:01:16.806
THIS IS ABOUT REDUCING OVERALL

01:01:16.873 --> 01:01:19.075
COSTS IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM

01:01:19.142 --> 01:01:20.777
FIRST AND FOREMOST. BUT THERE'S

01:01:20.843 --> 01:01:23.880
NOTHING THAT I APPRECIATE THAT.

01:01:23.946 --> 01:01:26.549
AND WE SEE A LOT OF BILLS LIKE

01:01:26.616 --> 01:01:27.116
THIS WHERE FRANKLY, IT FEELS

01:01:27.183 --> 01:01:28.418
LIKE WE'RE CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE

01:01:28.484 --> 01:01:31.687
OF A OF A BATTLE IN A WAR OF TWO

01:01:31.754 --> 01:01:34.090
GIANTS AND OR MAYBE ONE GIANT

01:01:34.157 --> 01:01:36.292
AND ONE, YOU KNOW, SLIGHTLY,

01:01:36.359 --> 01:01:38.795
SLIGHTLY LESS BIG GIANT. AND

01:01:38.861 --> 01:01:40.263
FRANKLY, IT'S ABOUT COST. AND

01:01:40.329 --> 01:01:41.264
FRANKLY, THERE'S NEVER ANYTHING

01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:43.366
IN OUR BILLS THAT ENSURE THERE'S

01:01:43.433 --> 01:01:44.534
NO PROVISION THAT TRIGGERS THAT

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:46.169
ANY SAVINGS WILL BE PASSED ON TO

01:01:46.235 --> 01:01:47.870
THE CONSUMER. AND SO THIS ISN'T

01:01:47.937 --> 01:01:48.871
JUST ABOUT THIS BILL

01:01:48.938 --> 01:01:50.339
NECESSARILY, BUT WHY NOT? WHY

01:01:50.406 --> 01:01:52.075
NOT INCLUDE THINGS IN OUR BILLS

01:01:52.141 --> 01:01:53.509
WHERE WHERE FRANKLY, WE'RE

01:01:53.576 --> 01:01:55.711
TRYING TO DO WHAT YOU'RE TRYING

01:01:55.778 --> 01:01:56.312
TO DO THAT ENSURES THAT COST

01:01:56.379 --> 01:01:58.448
SAVINGS ACTUALLY ARE PASSED DOWN

01:01:58.514 --> 01:01:59.849
TO THE CONSUMER. WE CAN DO THAT,

01:01:59.916 --> 01:02:01.350
AND WE CAN MAKE THOSE CHOICES.

01:02:01.417 --> 01:02:03.719
AND A LOT OF BILLS ABOUT HOW THE

01:02:03.786 --> 01:02:05.121
COST SAVINGS ARE PASSED ALONG.

01:02:05.188 --> 01:02:05.955
BUT I WANT TO JUST BE CLEAR

01:02:06.022 --> 01:02:07.123
ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE. SO

01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:09.625
WE HAVE THIS SYSTEM IN PLACE

01:02:09.692 --> 01:02:11.060
WHERE WE HAVE THE PATIENT HERE.

01:02:11.127 --> 01:02:12.295
WE HAVE THEIR PROVIDERS,

01:02:12.361 --> 01:02:15.565
DOCTORS, ETC. HERE WE HAVE THE

01:02:15.631 --> 01:02:16.833
PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY WHICH

01:02:16.899 --> 01:02:18.501
MANUFACTURES THE DRUGS THAT KEEP

01:02:18.568 --> 01:02:20.169
PEOPLE HEALTHY, AND WE HAVE THE

01:02:20.236 --> 01:02:21.671
PAYERS THE HEALTH PLANS. AND

01:02:21.737 --> 01:02:23.739
THEN RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF

01:02:23.806 --> 01:02:26.742
EVERYTHING ARE THE PBMS. AND

01:02:26.809 --> 01:02:28.845
THAT IS DRIVING UP COSTS. AND

01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:31.681
THE PHARMACIES ARE PART OF THE

01:02:31.747 --> 01:02:35.618
PROVIDER SYSTEM. AND SO, SO THAT

01:02:35.685 --> 01:02:37.553
THAT THAT'S THE ISSUE. IT'S

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:40.857
DRIVING UP COSTS FOR EVERYONE I

01:02:40.923 --> 01:02:42.792
GOT YOU KNOW, AND I GUESS THE

01:02:42.859 --> 01:02:45.528
UPSHOT AND I AM GOING TO SUPPORT

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:46.162
THE BILL, I OBVIOUSLY THINK THE

01:02:46.229 --> 01:02:46.796
CONFIDENTIALITY PROVISIONS FOR

01:02:46.863 --> 01:02:47.964
ME ARE PROBABLY MOST

01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:48.998
PROBLEMATIC. AND THEN SECONDLY,

01:02:49.065 --> 01:02:50.600
JUST JUST THE UPSHOT OF

01:02:50.666 --> 01:02:51.901
OBVIOUSLY EVERYTHING WE TRY TO

01:02:51.968 --> 01:02:54.036
DO HERE IS HELP. WE WANT TO HELP

01:02:54.103 --> 01:02:55.404
THE CONSUMER. AND FRANKLY, AT

01:02:55.471 --> 01:02:57.206
THE END OF THE DAY, I'M NOT SURE

01:02:57.273 --> 01:02:58.875
THIS DOES. I HOPE IT DOES. AND I

01:02:58.941 --> 01:03:01.244
THINK EVERYTHING YOU SAY, IF

01:03:01.310 --> 01:03:03.546
COMES TRUE, COULD. BUT IF THIS

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:06.015
IS MERELY A FIGHT BETWEEN TWO

01:03:06.082 --> 01:03:07.850
ENTITIES ON WHO KEEPS MORE OF

01:03:07.917 --> 01:03:09.785
THE PROFITS WITHIN THE SYSTEM,

01:03:09.852 --> 01:03:12.488
THEN OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW, IT'S

01:03:12.555 --> 01:03:14.023
PROBLEMATIC TO THINK OF THAT AS

01:03:14.090 --> 01:03:16.359
THE OUTCOME. YEAH, IT'S ABOUT AN

01:03:16.425 --> 01:03:17.560
INDUSTRY THAT'S DRIVING UP COSTS

01:03:17.627 --> 01:03:19.996
AND DESTROYING PHARMACIES. AND

01:03:20.062 --> 01:03:22.198
THAT IS INCREDIBLY HARMFUL TO

01:03:22.265 --> 01:03:22.899
CONSUMERS. LOSING YOUR

01:03:22.965 --> 01:03:25.401
NEIGHBORHOOD PHARMACY IS ALSO

01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:27.270
VERY HARMFUL. IT'S CERTAINLY NOT

01:03:27.336 --> 01:03:29.105
THE ONLY ISSUE I HAVE THAT

01:03:29.172 --> 01:03:30.706
AFTERNOON AND HEALTH COMMITTEE,

01:03:30.773 --> 01:03:32.975
I HAVE SB 363, WHICH IS A WHERE

01:03:33.042 --> 01:03:34.510
WE ARE TRYING TO HAVE BETTER

01:03:34.577 --> 01:03:35.645
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE HEALTH

01:03:35.711 --> 01:03:38.281
PLANS, FOR THEIR INAPPROPRIATE

01:03:38.347 --> 01:03:41.217
DENIALS OF PEOPLE'S CARE AND

01:03:41.284 --> 01:03:42.585
MORE AND MORE ACCOUNTABILITY

01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:44.854
THERE. SO THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT

01:03:44.921 --> 01:03:46.989
THE ONLY ISSUE, BUT IT IS ONE OF

01:03:47.056 --> 01:03:48.124
THEM. I APPRECIATE THAT,

01:03:48.191 --> 01:03:49.058
APPRECIATE YOUR ADVOCACY AND

01:03:49.125 --> 01:03:51.127
JUST HOW PASSIONATE YOU ARE. AND

01:03:51.194 --> 01:03:53.162
WHEN THE TIME COMES, I WILL MOVE

01:03:53.229 --> 01:03:58.601
THE BILL. SO THANK YOU. THANK

01:03:58.668 --> 01:04:00.369
YOU, SENATOR. AND AS SOMEONE

01:04:00.436 --> 01:04:01.737
THAT HAS DELVED A LITTLE BIT

01:04:01.804 --> 01:04:03.139
INTO THIS SPACE WITH MY

01:04:03.206 --> 01:04:05.241
LEGISLATION IN YEARS PAST, THE

01:04:05.308 --> 01:04:07.510
COMPLEXITY AND CONFUSION IN THE

01:04:07.577 --> 01:04:10.246
SYSTEM IS OFTENTIMES BY DESIGN.

01:04:10.313 --> 01:04:11.847
IT'S NOT IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S

01:04:11.914 --> 01:04:13.182
BEEN CREATED BECAUSE IT'S VERY

01:04:13.249 --> 01:04:16.285
DIFFICULT THEN TO CHANGE

01:04:16.352 --> 01:04:19.388
ANYTHING OR TO. AND IN MANY WAYS

01:04:19.455 --> 01:04:20.990
YOU DO HAVE TO ATTACK IT FROM

01:04:21.057 --> 01:04:22.291
MANY DIFFERENT ANGLES AND MANY

01:04:22.358 --> 01:04:23.626
DIFFERENT PIECES OF LEGISLATION.

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:25.895
I THINK TO THE SENATOR'S POINT,

01:04:25.962 --> 01:04:27.964
THE COMPLEMENTARY NATURE OF NOT

01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:29.265
JUST OF THIS, NOT JUST THE

01:04:29.332 --> 01:04:30.666
TRAILER BILL, BUT OTHER

01:04:30.733 --> 01:04:31.300
LEGISLATION THAT'S HAPPENING IS

01:04:31.367 --> 01:04:32.768
SOMEWHAT REQUIRED TO SOME

01:04:32.835 --> 01:04:34.370
EXTENT, UNLESS I DO HAVE A BILL

01:04:34.437 --> 01:04:35.938
IN MIND THAT COULD PROBABLY

01:04:36.005 --> 01:04:37.807
HANDLE ALL OF IT AT ONE TIME,

01:04:37.873 --> 01:04:41.177
BUT WE'LL GET TO THAT ONE LATER.

01:04:41.244 --> 01:04:44.180
YEAH, YEAH. AND SO, YOU KNOW,

01:04:44.247 --> 01:04:47.183
AND LOOK, I'VE HAD IN MY TIME IN

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:48.851
THE ASSEMBLY, I'VE HAD TWO

01:04:48.918 --> 01:04:50.987
RIBBON CUTTINGS FOR INDEPENDENT

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:51.654
PHARMACIES. THEY BOTH CLOSED AND

01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:52.788
ACTUALLY BOTH HAVE BEEN CLOSED

01:04:52.855 --> 01:04:54.690
FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS NOW. I

01:04:54.757 --> 01:04:56.692
THINK THAT SPEAKS TO PART OF

01:04:56.759 --> 01:04:58.894
WHAT YOU KNOW, THAT THAT

01:04:58.961 --> 01:05:00.329
COMPETITION IS A HEALTHY

01:05:00.396 --> 01:05:02.131
COMPETITION. THAT BEING SAID,

01:05:02.198 --> 01:05:03.966
THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS TO

01:05:04.033 --> 01:05:06.502
APPROACH IT. YOU KNOW, I GO TO

01:05:06.569 --> 01:05:08.037
THE PHARMACIES AT LEAST ONCE A

01:05:08.104 --> 01:05:10.006
WEEK FOR MY FATHER, IT SEEMS

01:05:10.072 --> 01:05:10.640
LIKE, AND DIFFERENT PHARMACIES

01:05:10.706 --> 01:05:11.974
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT, IT'S A

01:05:12.041 --> 01:05:13.676
COMBINATION OF IT'S A LOT OF

01:05:13.743 --> 01:05:15.544
WORK TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW

01:05:15.611 --> 01:05:16.145
TO GET THOSE THINGS DONE. BUT

01:05:16.212 --> 01:05:18.781
THAT BEING SAID, YOU KNOW,

01:05:18.848 --> 01:05:20.249
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE

01:05:20.316 --> 01:05:21.550
ADMINISTRATION AND WITH THE

01:05:21.617 --> 01:05:23.152
OPPOSITION IN TERMS OF SOME OF

01:05:23.219 --> 01:05:24.220
THE CONCERNS RAISED, I KNOW THAT

01:05:24.287 --> 01:05:25.054
THIS CONVERSATION HAS BEEN

01:05:25.121 --> 01:05:27.390
HAPPENING FOR A LONG TIME, AND

01:05:27.456 --> 01:05:27.923
THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME

01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:29.158
DISAGREEMENTS. THE LEGAL ONES

01:05:29.225 --> 01:05:30.393
MAY BE LEGAL ONES. OFTENTIMES

01:05:30.459 --> 01:05:33.195
YOU END UP IN COURT IF THERE'S

01:05:33.262 --> 01:05:34.330
JUST A AT THE END OF THE DAY,

01:05:34.397 --> 01:05:36.399
JUST A DISAGREEMENT ON ON A

01:05:36.465 --> 01:05:37.600
LEGAL ISSUE. OKAY. WELL, THAT'S

01:05:37.667 --> 01:05:38.968
WHAT OUR COURTS ARE FOR. WE

01:05:39.035 --> 01:05:40.736
CAN'T NECESSARILY MAKE THAT

01:05:40.803 --> 01:05:42.638
DECISION HERE TODAY AS TO WHO'S

01:05:42.705 --> 01:05:44.340
RIGHT ON THAT. WE'RE NOT WE'RE

01:05:44.407 --> 01:05:46.108
NOT I'M NOT A JUDGE UP HERE. BUT

01:05:46.175 --> 01:05:47.977
I WILL SAY THAT I DO APPRECIATE

01:05:48.044 --> 01:05:50.513
YOUR EFFORTS IN THIS SPACE AND

01:05:50.579 --> 01:05:51.580
ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO KEEP

01:05:51.647 --> 01:05:54.016
HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS. AND

01:05:54.083 --> 01:05:55.184
WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM. BUT

01:05:55.251 --> 01:05:57.520
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE

01:05:57.586 --> 01:05:58.087
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE

01:05:58.154 --> 01:06:00.890
VOTE? THANK YOU. AND THEN ON TO

01:06:00.956 --> 01:06:08.230

THANK YOU.

01:06:31.854 --> 01:06:37.226
OKAY. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. I'M

01:06:37.293 --> 01:06:40.496
HERE TO PRESENT SENATE BILL 378

01:06:40.563 --> 01:06:42.565
TO ALLOW CONSUMERS TO SEEK CIVIL

01:06:42.631 --> 01:06:44.066
PENALTIES AGAINST ONLINE

01:06:44.133 --> 01:06:46.235
MARKETPLACES THAT ADVERTISE

01:06:46.302 --> 01:06:48.871
ILLEGAL, INTOXICATING HEMP AND

01:06:48.938 --> 01:06:51.907
UNLICENSED CANNABIS PRODUCTS.

01:06:51.974 --> 01:06:54.510
FIRST, I WANT TO SAY THAT I DO

01:06:54.577 --> 01:06:57.346
PLAN TO REMOVE INDUSTRIAL HEMP

01:06:57.413 --> 01:06:58.914
PRODUCT REFERENCES FROM THE

01:06:58.981 --> 01:07:01.016
BILL. WE'RE ALSO WORKING TO

01:07:01.083 --> 01:07:02.785
ADDRESS STRICT LIABILITY ISSUES

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:04.286
FOR ENTITIES THAT ARE WORKING IN

01:07:04.353 --> 01:07:06.522
GOOD FAITH TO COMPLY WITH THE

01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:08.257
LAW, INCLUDING BY WORKING WITH

01:07:08.324 --> 01:07:09.225
COMMITTEES TO CONSIDER AN

01:07:09.291 --> 01:07:12.161
AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE. IN THE

01:07:12.228 --> 01:07:14.029
EVENT THAT THE DCC WEBSITE

01:07:14.096 --> 01:07:15.731
INCORRECTLY IDENTIFIES AND

01:07:15.798 --> 01:07:17.133
ADVERTISE THEIR PRODUCTS AS

01:07:17.199 --> 01:07:19.068
LICENSED OR REGISTERED. THESE

01:07:19.135 --> 01:07:20.369
CHANGES WILL HELP PREVENT BAD

01:07:20.436 --> 01:07:21.837
ACTORS FROM GETTING CAUGHT UP BY

01:07:21.904 --> 01:07:24.740
THE BILL'S PROVISIONS. I'M ALSO

01:07:24.807 --> 01:07:26.175
WORKING TO ADDRESS SOME

01:07:26.242 --> 01:07:27.243
QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED

01:07:27.309 --> 01:07:30.012
AROUND STANDING THAT'S BEEN

01:07:30.079 --> 01:07:33.382
IDENTIFIED. SO THIS BILL IS

01:07:33.449 --> 01:07:36.619
ABOUT WE HAVE A WE HAVE A LEGAL

01:07:36.685 --> 01:07:38.788
CANNABIS INDUSTRY THAT IS

01:07:38.854 --> 01:07:42.024
LICENSED, SAFETY TESTED,

01:07:42.091 --> 01:07:43.793
ACCOUNTABLE TO BE RESPONSIBLE

01:07:43.859 --> 01:07:46.028
AND NOT TO MAKE PEOPLE SICK OR

01:07:46.095 --> 01:07:48.164
GRANT ACCESS TO CHILDREN. AND

01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:51.333
THAT INDUSTRY IS COLLAPSING. WE

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:54.003
HAVE AN ILLICIT CANNABIS

01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:56.772
INDUSTRY, WHICH IS HUGE, WHICH

01:07:56.839 --> 01:07:58.974
IS NOT SAFETY TESTED, HAS NO

01:07:59.041 --> 01:08:02.578
HEALTH OR SAFETY STANDARDS, AND

01:08:02.645 --> 01:08:06.849
BUT IS LARGE. WE ALSO HAVE HEMP

01:08:06.916 --> 01:08:09.752
PRODUCTS THAT ARE AT SUCH HIGH

01:08:09.819 --> 01:08:10.886
CONCENTRATIONS THAT THEY ARE AT

01:08:10.953 --> 01:08:14.423
TIMES STRONGER THAN CANNABIS.

01:08:14.490 --> 01:08:16.459
AND FOR BOTH THE ILLICIT

01:08:16.525 --> 01:08:20.162
CANNABIS AND THESE HIGH POTENCY

01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:22.631
HEMP PRODUCTS, YOU CAN PURCHASE

01:08:22.698 --> 01:08:26.635
THEM ONLINE ON JUST PLATFORMS

01:08:26.702 --> 01:08:29.138
THAT WE ALL USE AND THAT

01:08:29.205 --> 01:08:30.973
CHILDREN HAVE EASY ACCESS TO.

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.808
AND SO YOU CAN HAVE A CHILD GO

01:08:32.875 --> 01:08:35.244
ON AND ORDER A HIGH

01:08:35.311 --> 01:08:36.312
CONCENTRATION HEMP PRODUCT

01:08:36.378 --> 01:08:37.580
THAT'S STRONGER THAN CANNABIS

01:08:37.646 --> 01:08:39.715
AND HAVE IT DELIVERED DIRECTLY

01:08:39.782 --> 01:08:41.784
TO THEIR HOME. AND THAT IS NOT

01:08:41.851 --> 01:08:44.253
IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE. SO THIS

01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:46.155
BILL WILL HELP ADDRESS THAT

01:08:46.222 --> 01:08:48.624
ISSUE BY PUTTING CERTAIN

01:08:48.691 --> 01:08:50.726
RESPONSIBILITIES ON PLATFORMS

01:08:50.793 --> 01:08:54.296
THAT ARE SELLING THESE TO EITHER

01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:55.364
SAY THAT THEY'RE NOT SELLING

01:08:55.431 --> 01:08:57.666
THEM, OR IF THEY ARE TO HAVE

01:08:57.733 --> 01:09:00.135
INFORMATION AND ABILITY TO

01:09:00.202 --> 01:09:03.038
REPORT, AND THEN TO CREATE

01:09:03.105 --> 01:09:04.840
LIABILITY. IF SOMEONE IS HARMED

01:09:04.907 --> 01:09:07.676
BY ONE OF THESE PRODUCTS THAT

01:09:07.743 --> 01:09:10.746
PURCHASED ON ONE OF THESE

01:09:10.813 --> 01:09:12.781
PLATFORMS. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK

01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:41.210
GREAT JOB OF EXPLAINING WHY WE

ILLEGAL HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND

01:09:56.725 --> 01:09:59.194
SO WE HAVE OBVIOUSLY OVERSIGHT.

01:09:59.261 --> 01:10:01.030

01:10:52.915 --> 01:10:56.518
EMBARC AND UFW. AND I'M HERE TO

01:10:56.585 --> 01:10:58.587
TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT ON THE

01:10:58.654 --> 01:11:00.356
LICENSED CANNABIS INDUSTRY AND

01:11:00.422 --> 01:11:04.259
GIVE IT A BIT MORE COLOR. THE

01:11:04.326 --> 01:11:06.462
ONLINE SALES OF THESE ILLEGAL

01:11:06.528 --> 01:11:07.896
PRODUCTS ARE MAKING IT HARD FOR

01:11:07.963 --> 01:11:10.466
US TO STAY IN BUSINESS. WE

01:11:10.532 --> 01:11:12.635
FOLLOW THE RULES, WE PAY OUR

01:11:12.701 --> 01:11:14.837
TAXES, WE PROVIDE GOOD JOBS. BUT

01:11:14.903 --> 01:11:15.938
CONSUMERS ARE LOOKING FOR

01:11:16.005 --> 01:11:19.341
CHEAPER ALTERNATIVES, WHICH

01:11:19.408 --> 01:11:20.976
MEANS WE'VE HAD TO MAKE SOME

01:11:21.043 --> 01:11:22.678
REALLY HARD DECISIONS IN THE

01:11:22.745 --> 01:11:26.148
PAST FEW YEARS, INCLUDING LAYING

01:11:26.215 --> 01:11:28.784
OFF EMPLOYEES, FREEZING SALARIES

01:11:28.851 --> 01:11:30.319
AND SHUTTING DOWN CERTAIN PARTS

01:11:30.386 --> 01:11:32.921
OF OUR BUSINESS LIKE OUR R&amp;D

01:11:32.988 --> 01:11:35.557
SECTION. WE ARE NOT ALONE IN

01:11:35.624 --> 01:11:37.593
THAT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE

01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:39.928
STATISTICS FROM THE CALIFORNIA

01:11:39.995 --> 01:11:41.764
SORRY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:45.434
CANNABIS CONTROL, 70% OF

01:11:45.501 --> 01:11:47.336
LICENSED CANNABIS MANUFACTURERS

01:11:47.403 --> 01:11:49.638
IN CALIFORNIA HAVE SURRENDERED

01:11:49.705 --> 01:11:51.373
THEIR LICENSE IN THE PAST FEW

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:53.609
YEARS. IT IS A BLOODBATH BECAUSE

01:11:53.676 --> 01:11:55.678
WE'RE LOSING OUT TO THIS MORE

01:11:55.744 --> 01:12:00.049
CONVENIENT OPTION. SO MEANWHILE.

01:12:00.115 --> 01:12:03.352
WE WORKED COLLABORATIVELY ON A

01:12:03.419 --> 01:12:05.621
STUDY ON THE INTOXICATING HEMP

01:12:05.688 --> 01:12:07.623
PRODUCTS. ABOUT A YEAR AGO, WE

01:12:07.690 --> 01:12:09.892
PURCHASED HUNDREDS OF ILLEGAL

01:12:09.958 --> 01:12:11.593
PRODUCTS. ALL OF THEM WERE

01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:14.029
SHIPPED TO OUR PLACE OF BUSINESS

01:12:14.096 --> 01:12:17.800
AND OUR HOMES DIRECTLY. 91%

01:12:17.866 --> 01:12:19.902
DIDN'T CHARGE SALES AND USE TAX,

01:12:19.968 --> 01:12:22.738
LET ALONE CANNABIS EXCISE TAX,

01:12:22.805 --> 01:12:26.008
AND 95% OF THEM CONTAIN

01:12:26.075 --> 01:12:28.177
SYNTHETICS. THESE ARE NOT SAFE

01:12:28.243 --> 01:12:30.412
PRODUCTS. SO IN CONCLUSION, I

01:12:30.479 --> 01:12:32.181
WOULD SAY THAT THAT ONLINE

01:12:32.247 --> 01:12:34.016
MARKETPLACE, IT THRIVES IN

01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:35.784
WHAT'S CURRENTLY A REGULATORY

01:12:35.851 --> 01:12:38.620
BLIND SPOT. SO THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:12:38.687 --> 01:12:40.556
CANNABIS CONTROL TENDS TO FOCUS

01:12:40.622 --> 01:12:43.592
ON ENFORCING AGAINST ILLICIT

01:12:43.659 --> 01:12:45.060
CULTIVATION. LOCAL LAW

01:12:45.127 --> 01:12:47.529
ENFORCEMENT TENDS TO FOCUS ON

01:12:47.596 --> 01:12:49.598
ILLICIT STOREFRONTS, AND NOBODY

01:12:49.665 --> 01:12:51.900
IS PAYING ATTENTION TO THE SPACE

01:12:51.967 --> 01:12:53.736
BETWEEN. WITH THAT, I WOULD

01:12:53.802 --> 01:12:55.504
RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE.

01:12:55.571 --> 01:12:57.473

HERE IN OPPOSITION TO SB 378?

01:14:24.359 --> 01:14:26.195
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. GOOD

01:14:26.261 --> 01:14:28.197
MORNING, CHAIR AND MEMBERS, JOSE

01:14:28.263 --> 01:14:29.231
TORRES WITH TECHNET. WE REMAIN

01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:30.999
WE REMAIN IN RESPECTFUL

01:14:31.066 --> 01:14:33.168
OPPOSITION TO SB 378. THE BILL

01:14:33.235 --> 01:14:34.736
HAS A GREATLY BROAD DEFINITION

01:14:34.803 --> 01:14:36.705
OF ONLINE CANNABIS AND HEMP

01:14:36.772 --> 01:14:38.207
MARKETPLACES, AND IT PLACES A

01:14:38.273 --> 01:14:39.575
STRICT LIABILITY ON THEM, EVEN

01:14:39.641 --> 01:14:41.376
IF THEY HAVE NO DIRECT ROLE IN

01:14:41.443 --> 01:14:43.979
THE SALES. FOR EXAMPLE, IF AN

01:14:44.046 --> 01:14:45.314
ONLINE BUSINESS EXPLICITLY

01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:46.949
PROHIBITS THE SALE OF AND

01:14:47.015 --> 01:14:47.983
ADVERTISEMENT OF CANNABIS GOODS,

01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:49.685
BUT THAT ONLINE BUSINESS ALLOWS

01:14:49.751 --> 01:14:51.353
FOR USERS TO DIRECT TO DIRECTLY

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:52.788
COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER,

01:14:52.855 --> 01:14:54.256
THEY WOULD BE FOUND LIABLE UNDER

01:14:54.323 --> 01:14:56.525
THIS BILL. MAPPING SERVICES,

01:14:56.592 --> 01:14:58.293
SEARCH ENGINES, SOCIAL MEDIA AND

01:14:58.360 --> 01:14:59.761
OTHER DIGITAL PLATFORMS WOULD BE

01:14:59.828 --> 01:15:01.663
COVERED UNDER LIABILITY UNDER

01:15:01.730 --> 01:15:02.798
THIS BILL BECAUSE OF JUST HOW

01:15:02.865 --> 01:15:05.868
BROAD IT IS, OUR TECHNET MEMBER

01:15:05.934 --> 01:15:07.569
COMPANIES REMAIN COMMITTED TO

01:15:07.636 --> 01:15:08.437
ENSURING THAT ONLINE

01:15:08.503 --> 01:15:09.438
MARKETPLACES HAVE REASONABLE

01:15:09.504 --> 01:15:12.207
RESTRICTIONS AND POLICIES IN

01:15:12.274 --> 01:15:13.842
PLACE TO ACTIVELY ENFORCE

01:15:13.909 --> 01:15:15.043
PROVISIONS ON ILLICIT PRODUCTS,

01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:17.746
BUT IT CREATES A LARGE UMBRELLA

01:15:17.813 --> 01:15:18.814
OF LIABILITY OVER COMPANIES AND

01:15:18.881 --> 01:15:24.186
BUSINESSES. WITH AN ONLINE

01:15:24.253 --> 01:15:25.320
PRESENCE THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

01:15:25.387 --> 01:15:26.688
WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S

01:15:26.755 --> 01:15:28.590
ANALYSIS IN RECOGNIZING AND

01:15:28.657 --> 01:15:29.658
FLAGGING SOME OF THESE CONCERNS

01:15:29.725 --> 01:15:31.393
OF THE BILL BEING OVERBROAD AND

01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:33.028
NEEDING TO BE NARROWLY TAILORED.

01:15:33.095 --> 01:15:34.963
WE CONTINUE TO BE READY TO HAVE

01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:36.565
SUCH DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHOR

01:15:36.632 --> 01:15:38.100
ON WHAT THAT MAY LOOK LIKE, BUT

01:15:38.166 --> 01:15:39.902
AS AS IS, WE REMAIN IN

01:15:39.968 --> 01:15:41.536
OPPOSITION. THE BILL RISKS OVER

01:15:41.603 --> 01:15:42.471
COMPLIANCE AND COULD CHILL

01:15:42.537 --> 01:15:44.172
LEGITIMATE SPEECH AND ACCESS TO

01:15:44.239 --> 01:15:45.807
LEGAL PRODUCTS. DUE TO THE

01:15:45.874 --> 01:15:46.575
STRICT LIABILITY REPORTING

01:15:46.642 --> 01:15:48.277
REQUIREMENTS AND ADVERTISING

01:15:48.343 --> 01:15:49.378
PROVISIONS. IT IS A HEAVY HANDED

01:15:49.444 --> 01:15:50.512
APPROACH THAT WOULD HURT

01:15:50.579 --> 01:15:51.513
BUSINESSES MORE THAN ACTUALLY

01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:52.581
ELIMINATE UNLAWFUL CANNABIS

01:15:52.648 --> 01:15:54.750
SALES. I THANK YOU FOR I THANK

01:15:54.816 --> 01:15:56.218
YOU FOR YOUR TIME, BUT I ASK

01:15:56.285 --> 01:15:58.687
THAT YOU VOTE NO TODAY. THANK

01:15:58.754 --> 01:16:01.290
YOU. GOOD MORNING, CHAIRPERSON

01:16:01.356 --> 01:16:03.058

REGULATORY MATTERS AS WELL AS

01:16:12.034 --> 01:16:14.303
BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS. I'M HERE

01:16:14.369 --> 01:16:16.538
TODAY ON BEHALF OF MEDTERRA CBD

01:16:16.605 --> 01:16:20.375

OPPOSITION TO THE BILL IF IT IS

01:16:24.179 --> 01:16:27.115
NOT AMENDED. SB 378, AS

01:16:27.182 --> 01:16:28.684
CURRENTLY DRAFTED, WOULD

01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:30.419
EFFECTIVELY BAN THE DIRECT TO

01:16:30.485 --> 01:16:32.521
CONSUMER SALE OF HEMP PRODUCTS

01:16:32.587 --> 01:16:34.423
ONLINE, CUTTING OFF A VITAL

01:16:34.489 --> 01:16:35.791

01:16:37.125 --> 01:16:39.061
PRODUCTS FOR THEIR HEALTH AND

01:16:39.127 --> 01:16:40.929
WELLNESS. THIS APPROACH DOES NOT

01:16:40.996 --> 01:16:42.230
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN RESPONSIBLE

01:16:42.297 --> 01:16:44.132
LICENSED MANUFACTURERS WHO

01:16:44.199 --> 01:16:45.534
ADHERE TO RIGOROUS TESTING,

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:47.035
LABELING, AND AGE RESTRICTION

01:16:47.102 --> 01:16:48.603
STANDARDS, AND THE BAD ACTORS

01:16:48.670 --> 01:16:50.505
THE BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS.

01:16:50.572 --> 01:16:52.174
INSTEAD, IT THREATENS TO

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:53.475
DISMANTLE CALIFORNIA'S

01:16:53.542 --> 01:16:54.843
LEGITIMATE HEMP INDUSTRY,

01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:56.645
RESULTING IN THE LOSS OF

01:16:56.712 --> 01:16:58.447
THOUSANDS OF JOBS AND TENS OF

01:16:58.513 --> 01:16:59.915
MILLIONS IN TAX REVENUE, WHILE

01:16:59.982 --> 01:17:02.217
DEPRIVING CONSUMERS OF SAFE,

REGULATED ACCESS TO WELLNESS

01:17:03.618 --> 01:17:05.687
PRODUCTS THAT THEY TRUST. WE

01:17:05.754 --> 01:17:07.823
AGREE THAT THE UNREGULATED,

01:17:07.889 --> 01:17:09.291
INTOXICATING HEMP PRODUCT

01:17:09.358 --> 01:17:11.426
PRODUCTS HAVE NO PLACE IN THE

01:17:11.493 --> 01:17:12.928
MARKETPLACE. HOWEVER, RATHER

01:17:12.995 --> 01:17:14.796
THAN AN OUTRIGHT BAN, WE URGE

01:17:14.863 --> 01:17:16.431
THE LEGISLATURE TO ADOPT A

01:17:16.498 --> 01:17:18.667

01:17:18.734 --> 01:17:20.068

MEASURES ALREADY IN PLACE IN

01:17:26.575 --> 01:17:28.310
MANY OTHER STATES. THIS WOULD

01:17:28.377 --> 01:17:30.012
PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENSURE

01:17:30.078 --> 01:17:32.381
NOT ONLY THAT SAFE AND

01:17:32.447 --> 01:17:33.115

01:18:12.888 --> 01:18:13.722
ABOUT THE DORMANT COMMERCE

01:18:13.789 --> 01:18:14.356
CLAUSE. OBVIOUSLY, THERE HAVE

01:18:14.423 --> 01:18:15.991
BEEN FEDERAL COURT DECISIONS,

01:18:16.058 --> 01:18:18.193

STATE LEVEL HEMP RESTRICTION.

01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:24.933

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.103
FOR THE COMMITTEE THAT THE

01:18:28.170 --> 01:18:29.471

WELLNESS PRODUCTS THAT ARE NOT

01:19:10.112 --> 01:19:13.048

BACK TO COMMITTEE. AND I JUST

01:20:15.610 --> 01:20:16.745
WANT TO START, SENATOR, I THINK

01:20:16.811 --> 01:20:18.880
THAT AND I ALSO WANT TO COMMEND

01:20:18.947 --> 01:20:20.215
OUR CHIEF CONSULTANT FOR THE

01:20:20.282 --> 01:20:21.850
GREAT ANALYSIS, I THINK ALSO IS

01:20:21.917 --> 01:20:23.718
A REALLY GOOD PRIMER, KIND OF A

01:20:23.785 --> 01:20:25.120
LITTLE BIT ON THE HISTORY OF

01:20:25.187 --> 01:20:28.123
CANNABIS AND HEMP POLICY AND

01:20:28.190 --> 01:20:30.825
REGULATION LEGISLATION, ON THE

01:20:30.892 --> 01:20:33.662
ISSUE OF A COUPLE OF THE ISSUES

01:20:33.728 --> 01:20:34.629
REGARDING BOTH STRICT LIABILITY

01:20:34.696 --> 01:20:36.698
AS WELL AS THE FIRST AMENDMENT

01:20:36.765 --> 01:20:38.333
ISSUE. AND YOU ALREADY MENTIONED

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:38.934
IN YOUR OPENING THAT YOU'RE

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.001
GOING TO WORK KIND OF MORE

01:20:40.068 --> 01:20:42.404
NARROWLY TAILOR THE LEGISLATION.

01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:43.872
AND WHAT WAYS AT THIS MOMENT, I

01:20:43.939 --> 01:20:45.607
KNOW THERE MIGHT BE MORE

01:20:45.674 --> 01:20:47.108
CONVERSATIONS AND MORE WORK ON

01:20:47.175 --> 01:20:49.077
YOUR END WITH OUR COMMITTEE AND

01:20:49.144 --> 01:20:51.146
WHAT HAVE YOU. WHAT WAYS ARE YOU

01:20:51.213 --> 01:20:52.781
LOOKING AT TRYING TO DO THAT IN

01:20:52.847 --> 01:20:55.083
TERMS OF FURTHER NARROW,

01:20:55.150 --> 01:20:56.718
NARROWLY TAILORING THE

01:20:56.785 --> 01:20:59.354
LEGISLATION? THAT'S A BROAD

01:20:59.421 --> 01:21:00.822
QUESTION, BUT IT'S BROAD. BUT I

01:21:00.889 --> 01:21:03.024
MEAN, I THINK IT CAME UP A LOT.

01:21:03.091 --> 01:21:04.092
YEAH, IT'S I THINK THAT THE

01:21:04.159 --> 01:21:06.061
ARGUMENT IS THAT THE LEGISLATION

01:21:06.127 --> 01:21:07.429
IS BROAD. SO HOW DO WE TAILOR

01:21:07.495 --> 01:21:10.165
IT? IT IS IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF

01:21:10.232 --> 01:21:13.735
THE WILD WEST OUT THERE. WE ONE

01:21:13.802 --> 01:21:15.904
OF THE COMPLEXITIES HERE IS THAT

01:21:15.971 --> 01:21:18.373
THIS BILL DOES NOT DECIDE WHAT

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:20.809
KIND OF HEMP IS LEGAL OR

01:21:20.875 --> 01:21:22.277
ILLEGAL. THAT'S A SEPARATE

01:21:22.344 --> 01:21:25.880
MATTER IN FEDERAL AND STATE LAW.

01:21:25.947 --> 01:21:28.083
THERE IS A BILL MOVING FORWARD

01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:30.018
THIS YEAR BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:21:30.085 --> 01:21:33.255
AGUIAR-CURRY. IS IT AB AB EIGHT

01:21:33.321 --> 01:21:35.023
THAT ACTUALLY DEALS WITH THAT

01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:36.391
ISSUE? THE GOVERNOR ISSUED AN

01:21:36.458 --> 01:21:37.959
EXECUTIVE ORDER. SOME MEMBER

01:21:38.026 --> 01:21:39.628
AGUIAR-CURRY IS WORKING ON IT.

01:21:39.694 --> 01:21:40.662
WE ARE NOT SEPARATELY SAYING

01:21:40.729 --> 01:21:42.897
WHAT IS LEGAL AND WHAT IS

01:21:42.964 --> 01:21:44.766
ILLEGAL. THAT IS EXISTING LAW

01:21:44.833 --> 01:21:47.168
AND POTENTIALLY NEW LAW THIS

01:21:47.235 --> 01:21:51.139
YEAR. THIS IS ABOUT IF YOU ARE

01:21:51.206 --> 01:21:52.907
IF WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT IS

01:21:52.974 --> 01:21:55.810
ILLEGAL THAT IS BEING SOLD IN AN

01:21:55.877 --> 01:21:57.979
ONLINE MARKETPLACE, NOT ON NOT

01:21:58.046 --> 01:22:00.515
VIA GOOGLE MAPS, NOT VIA, YOU

01:22:00.582 --> 01:22:02.751
KNOW, SOME SORT OF PRIVATE

01:22:02.817 --> 01:22:04.419
MESSAGE OFFERING ON A

01:22:04.486 --> 01:22:07.322
MARKETPLACE BEING SOLD, HAVING

01:22:07.389 --> 01:22:08.723
RESPONSIBILITIES TO TRY TO

01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:10.625
PROTECT AGAINST THAT SO PEOPLE

01:22:10.692 --> 01:22:11.993
KNOW SO PEOPLE CAN REPORT IT.

01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:13.962
AND IF SOMEONE IS HARMED, IF

01:22:14.029 --> 01:22:16.298
YOU'RE 15 YEAR OLD, ORDERS SOME

01:22:16.364 --> 01:22:18.199
HIGH CONCENTRATION OF HEMP AND

01:22:18.266 --> 01:22:20.101
GETS IT DELIVERED AND GETS SICK,

01:22:20.168 --> 01:22:22.470
THAT THERE'S ACCOUNTABILITY FOR

01:22:22.537 --> 01:22:23.838
THAT, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING

01:22:23.905 --> 01:22:25.840
TO DO. WE ARE ABSOLUTELY WILL

01:22:25.907 --> 01:22:28.176
CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN TERMS OF

01:22:28.243 --> 01:22:30.312
MAKING SURE THAT THE BILL IS

01:22:30.378 --> 01:22:32.847
FOCUSED, AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO

01:22:32.914 --> 01:22:35.684
DOING THAT. SUMMARY OF

01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:38.953
BAUER-KAHAN. WELL, THANK YOU,

01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:40.388
SENATOR, AND EVERYBODY WHO'S

01:22:40.455 --> 01:22:45.193
HERE. THIS IS MY THIRD

01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:46.261
OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THE BILL

01:22:46.328 --> 01:22:47.896
BECAUSE YOU WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO

01:22:47.962 --> 01:22:49.931
BE SELECTED BY OUR AMAZING RULES

01:22:49.998 --> 01:22:51.032
CHAIR. AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK

01:22:51.099 --> 01:22:53.034
THE POINT YOU MADE, WHICH WAS AN

01:22:53.101 --> 01:22:53.902
IMPORTANT ONE, SENATOR, ABOUT

01:22:53.968 --> 01:22:55.337
THE DEFINITION OF MARKETPLACE,

01:22:55.403 --> 01:22:57.305
ADDRESSES SOME OF THE CONCERNS

01:22:57.372 --> 01:23:00.275
THAT THE OPPOSITION BROUGHT UP.

01:23:00.342 --> 01:23:02.977
BUT I DO IT'S FUNNY, WHEN I WAS

01:23:03.044 --> 01:23:06.014
IN LAW SCHOOL AND I LEARNED

01:23:06.081 --> 01:23:06.581
ABOUT THE DORMANT COMMERCE

01:23:06.648 --> 01:23:07.816
CLAUSE, I WAS TOLD I WOULD NEVER

01:23:07.882 --> 01:23:09.217
NEED TO KNOW IT. NOW, I DON'T

01:23:09.284 --> 01:23:11.386
KNOW HOW MANY TIMES IN MY

01:23:11.453 --> 01:23:12.020
LEGISLATIVE CAREER I'VE HAD TO

01:23:12.087 --> 01:23:13.555
KNOW ABOUT THE DORMANT COMMERCE

01:23:13.621 --> 01:23:15.357
CLAUSE. I DO THINK PART OF WHAT

01:23:15.423 --> 01:23:16.791
ALLOWS THIS BILL TO OVERCOME

01:23:16.858 --> 01:23:18.026
THAT AND OTHER ISSUES, IS THE

01:23:18.093 --> 01:23:19.260
SINCERE GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST IN

01:23:19.327 --> 01:23:20.495
PROTECTING CHILDREN, RIGHT. AND

01:23:20.562 --> 01:23:21.763
WHAT YOU FUNDAMENTALLY ARE

01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:23.765
TRYING TO DO HERE IS ENSURE THAT

01:23:23.832 --> 01:23:26.134
WE DON'T HAVE A WILD WEST WHERE

01:23:26.201 --> 01:23:27.535
KIDS CAN EASILY GET THEIR HANDS

01:23:27.602 --> 01:23:29.371
ON PRODUCTS THAT ARE HARMFUL.

01:23:29.437 --> 01:23:30.805
AND THERE'S A REASON THAT WHEN

01:23:30.872 --> 01:23:33.274
WE LEGALIZED CANNABIS IN THIS

01:23:33.341 --> 01:23:35.844
STATE, WE DID SO IN A WAY THAT

01:23:35.910 --> 01:23:36.878
MADE SURE KIDS COULD NOT GET

01:23:36.945 --> 01:23:38.179
THEIR HANDS ON IT, THAT IT WAS

01:23:38.246 --> 01:23:40.482
HIGHLY REGULATED, THAT IT WAS

01:23:40.548 --> 01:23:41.750
SAFE FOR CONSUMERS. AND I WILL

01:23:41.816 --> 01:23:43.785
SAY, YOU KNOW, BEING OLDER THAN

01:23:43.852 --> 01:23:46.755
SOME, YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT THE

01:23:46.821 --> 01:23:48.857
DIRECTION THAT WE'VE GONE WITH,

01:23:48.923 --> 01:23:51.025
YOU KNOW, FENTANYL AND ALL OF

01:23:51.092 --> 01:23:53.228
THAT, THE FACT THAT WE DO HAVE A

01:23:53.294 --> 01:23:53.862
LEGAL MARKETPLACE FOR CANNABIS,

01:23:53.928 --> 01:23:55.130
WHERE, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN GET A

01:23:55.196 --> 01:23:56.765
SAFE PRODUCT IS ACTUALLY A

01:23:56.831 --> 01:23:58.266
BENEFIT TO CALIFORNIANS. AND SO

01:23:58.333 --> 01:23:59.734
I THINK THAT THE WORK YOU'RE

01:23:59.801 --> 01:24:00.902
DOING HERE IS REALLY IMPORTANT.

01:24:00.969 --> 01:24:02.404
I WILL SAY THAT I APPRECIATE

01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:03.972
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT

01:24:04.038 --> 01:24:04.873
ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S AGUIAR-CURRY

01:24:04.939 --> 01:24:06.107
DEALING SEPARATELY. AND I

01:24:06.174 --> 01:24:07.976
SUPPORT HER, BILL. AND I THINK

01:24:08.042 --> 01:24:09.944
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. BUT I

01:24:10.011 --> 01:24:10.545
DO THINK THEY'RE DIFFERENT. I

01:24:10.612 --> 01:24:11.846
THINK SHE'S DOING A MUCH BROADER

01:24:11.913 --> 01:24:13.081
QUESTION OF HOW SHOULD WE

01:24:13.148 --> 01:24:14.282
REGULATE HEMP. AND HERE WE'RE

01:24:14.349 --> 01:24:16.418
SAYING, WHERE SHOULD THERE BE

01:24:16.484 --> 01:24:18.086
STRICT LIABILITY FOR

01:24:18.153 --> 01:24:19.354
MARKETPLACES? AND I WILL SAY I

01:24:19.421 --> 01:24:20.922
REPRESENT ONE OF THE LARGEST

01:24:20.989 --> 01:24:21.923
RETIREMENT COMMUNITIES IN THE

01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:23.425
STATE, WHERE THEY LOVE THEIR CBD

01:24:23.491 --> 01:24:24.426
CREAMS THAT ARE

01:24:24.492 --> 01:24:25.059
NON-INTOXICATING. AND IF THEY

01:24:25.126 --> 01:24:27.362
CAN'T GET THOSE DELIVERED, AND I

01:24:27.429 --> 01:24:29.297
DON'T SEE WHAT THE HARM OF THAT

01:24:29.364 --> 01:24:30.165
IS, THAT SHOULD NOT BE WHAT THIS

01:24:30.231 --> 01:24:32.634
IS COVERING, RIGHT? EVEN IF NO

01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:33.802
MATTER WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE

01:24:33.868 --> 01:24:35.203
AGUIAR-CURRY BILL. SO I DO THINK

01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:37.105
THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME NARROWING

01:24:37.172 --> 01:24:38.606
IN THIS BILL OF WHAT IS COVERED,

01:24:38.673 --> 01:24:41.142
AND IT SHOULD BE WHAT IS TRULY

01:24:41.209 --> 01:24:42.444
HARMING CONSUMERS AND NOT HEMP

01:24:42.510 --> 01:24:44.012
BROADLY. BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS

01:24:44.078 --> 01:24:46.781
THAT THAT IS FORTHCOMING. YES.

01:24:46.848 --> 01:24:48.616
WE'RE WE'RE YES, WE'RE IN

01:24:48.683 --> 01:24:49.350
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THOSE

01:24:49.417 --> 01:24:50.318
ISSUES. OKAY. SO THAT WAS I

01:24:50.385 --> 01:24:52.554
THINK I WANTED TO CLARIFY WHAT I

01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:53.688
THINK THE CHAIR WAS ASKING

01:24:53.755 --> 01:24:58.226
ABOUT. SO WITH THAT, I MEAN, I

01:24:58.293 --> 01:24:59.327
THINK THAT WILL PROBABLY ADDRESS

01:24:59.394 --> 01:25:00.862
THE CONCERNS THAT WE'RE HEARING

01:25:00.929 --> 01:25:02.964
FROM, YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE

01:25:03.031 --> 01:25:04.699
OPPOSITION, NOT ALL OF THE

01:25:04.766 --> 01:25:08.069
OPPOSITION. SO I GUESS I WANT TO

01:25:08.136 --> 01:25:10.405
ASK IF IT'S OKAY WITH THE CHAIR,

01:25:10.472 --> 01:25:13.341
A QUESTION OF TECHNET, WHICH IS

01:25:13.408 --> 01:25:15.610
I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE POLICIES

01:25:15.677 --> 01:25:18.446
THAT YOU'RE THAT THE

01:25:18.513 --> 01:25:21.683
MARKETPLACES ASK, IF YOU WILL,

01:25:21.749 --> 01:25:23.985
THEIR SELLERS TO ABIDE BY. TO

01:25:24.052 --> 01:25:26.421
ME, THAT IS INSUFFICIENT. I

01:25:26.488 --> 01:25:27.822
THINK THAT THERE IS AN

01:25:27.889 --> 01:25:29.224
OBLIGATION OF THE MARKETPLACES

01:25:29.290 --> 01:25:31.426
WHO ARE PROFITING OFF OF THE

01:25:31.493 --> 01:25:32.594
SALE OF WHATEVER GOODS ARE SOLD

01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:36.097
IN THEIR MARKETPLACES. TO GO

01:25:36.164 --> 01:25:39.033
FURTHER THAN ASKING NICELY TO

01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:42.170
NOT SELL HARMFUL PRODUCTS. AND I

01:25:42.237 --> 01:25:43.471
STRUGGLE WITH STRICT LIABILITY.

01:25:43.538 --> 01:25:44.272
I'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION WITH

01:25:44.339 --> 01:25:47.308
THE SPONSORS BECAUSE I DO THINK

01:25:47.375 --> 01:25:49.811
THAT IN THE WILD WEST IT IS OUT

01:25:49.878 --> 01:25:51.746
THERE ON THE INTERNET. YOU COULD

01:25:51.813 --> 01:25:53.114
HAVE A COMPANY THAT IS DOING

01:25:53.181 --> 01:25:54.382
EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER, USING

01:25:54.449 --> 01:25:57.719
THE BEST TECHNOLOGY TO ENSURE

01:25:57.785 --> 01:26:00.154
THAT IT'S NOT ON THEIR PLATFORM

01:26:00.221 --> 01:26:02.924
AND IT MIGHT GET THROUGH. ON THE

01:26:02.991 --> 01:26:04.125
OTHER HAND, I THINK YOUR

01:26:04.192 --> 01:26:08.162
TESTIMONY PUT THE OBLIGATION

01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:09.531
ENTIRELY ON THE PEOPLE USING

01:26:09.597 --> 01:26:11.799
YOUR MARKETPLACES, NOT ON THE

01:26:11.866 --> 01:26:13.234
MARKETPLACES THEMSELVES. AND I

01:26:13.301 --> 01:26:15.336
THINK THAT IS INCREDIBLY

01:26:15.403 --> 01:26:16.371
PROBLEMATIC. I THINK IF YOU ARE

01:26:16.437 --> 01:26:17.939
GOING TO PROFIT OFF THE SALE OF

01:26:18.006 --> 01:26:19.707
A PRODUCT IN CALIFORNIA, YOU

01:26:19.774 --> 01:26:21.009
HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO DO SO

01:26:21.075 --> 01:26:23.545
IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T HARM

01:26:23.611 --> 01:26:24.145
CALIFORNIANS. AND THAT IS FOR

01:26:24.212 --> 01:26:25.346
BOTH THE DIRECT SELLER AND THE

01:26:25.413 --> 01:26:27.248
MARKETPLACE. AND SO, I GUESS IS

01:26:27.315 --> 01:26:28.716
MY QUESTION IS, DO YOU NOT

01:26:28.783 --> 01:26:31.119
BELIEVE THAT I AS ADVANCED AS IT

01:26:31.185 --> 01:26:34.055
IS, IT IS THAT SOME OF THESE

01:26:34.122 --> 01:26:35.490
COMPANIES HAS THE ABILITY TO USE

01:26:35.557 --> 01:26:37.358
MACHINE LEARNING TO DETECT, AND

01:26:37.425 --> 01:26:39.127
IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF CASES,

01:26:39.193 --> 01:26:40.495
ENSURE WE ARE NOT SELLING

01:26:40.562 --> 01:26:41.629
INTOXICATING HEMP ON THE

01:26:41.696 --> 01:26:44.132
MARKETPLACES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR

01:26:44.198 --> 01:26:46.167
QUESTION. THROUGH THE CHAIR

01:26:46.234 --> 01:26:48.803
DIRECT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR

01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:49.904
QUESTION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR

01:26:49.971 --> 01:26:53.808
QUESTION. SO I MEAN, YES, YOU

01:26:53.875 --> 01:26:56.077
KNOW, TECHNOLOGY CAN BE USED IN

01:26:56.144 --> 01:26:57.178
SOME CIRCUMSTANCES. I CAN'T

01:26:57.245 --> 01:26:59.948
SPEAK FOR EACH AND EVERY OF MY

01:27:00.014 --> 01:27:01.749
MEMBER COMPANIES ON HOW THEIR

01:27:01.816 --> 01:27:03.284
INTERNAL PROCEDURES ARE. IT CAN

01:27:03.351 --> 01:27:05.520
BE USED AS A TOOL WITHIN WITHIN

01:27:05.587 --> 01:27:06.354
THEM. BUT AGAIN, AS YOU

01:27:06.421 --> 01:27:08.690
MENTIONED, THERE IS A VARIETY OF

01:27:08.756 --> 01:27:11.392
JUST MEMBER COMPANIES ON SOME ON

01:27:11.459 --> 01:27:13.728
HOW THEY WORK INTERNALLY. BUT IN

01:27:13.795 --> 01:27:15.096
SOME INSTANCES, YES, I CAN BE

01:27:15.163 --> 01:27:17.031
USED AS A TOOL, BUT I CAN'T

01:27:17.098 --> 01:27:19.133
SPEAK FOR EACH AND EVERY ONE OF

01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:20.802
OUR INTERNAL PROCEDURES. RIGHT.

01:27:20.868 --> 01:27:22.003
WELL, I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE

01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:23.938
BILL TODAY BECAUSE I THINK THAT

01:27:24.005 --> 01:27:25.373
WHAT FRUSTRATES ME IS THAT THEY

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:27.742
NEED TO CHANGE THE WAY THEY DO

01:27:27.809 --> 01:27:28.876
BUSINESS IF THEY'RE HARMING

01:27:28.943 --> 01:27:30.278
CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN. SO I KNOW

01:27:30.345 --> 01:27:31.312
CHAIRING THE PRIVACY COMMITTEE,

01:27:31.379 --> 01:27:32.680
THAT THERE ARE GOOD ACTORS AND

01:27:32.747 --> 01:27:34.115
BAD ACTORS IN ANY SPACE,

01:27:34.182 --> 01:27:36.351
INCLUDING IN THE ONLINE SPACE,

01:27:36.417 --> 01:27:38.152
AND THAT, YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE

01:27:38.219 --> 01:27:40.722
GOOD ACTORS WHO I KNOW HAVE BEEN

01:27:40.788 --> 01:27:42.490
IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

01:27:42.557 --> 01:27:44.959
SPONSORS AND ARE TAKING THOSE

01:27:45.026 --> 01:27:46.461
STEPS. AND, YOU KNOW, I KNOW

01:27:46.527 --> 01:27:47.862
THAT THINGS HAVE BEEN OFFERED TO

01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:50.064
THOSE COMPANIES, LIKE A RIGHT TO

01:27:50.131 --> 01:27:52.867
CURE THAT. EVERY COMPANY SHOULD

01:27:52.934 --> 01:27:55.503
BE DOING THAT, AND THEY NEED TO

01:27:55.570 --> 01:27:56.904
STEP UP TO THE PLATE AND NOT

01:27:56.971 --> 01:27:58.806
JUST CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT

01:27:58.873 --> 01:28:00.174
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT THE SELLER,

01:28:00.241 --> 01:28:01.409
THAT THEY DON'T HAVE LIABILITY

01:28:01.476 --> 01:28:03.344
IF THEY HARM CALIFORNIA'S

01:28:03.411 --> 01:28:05.580
CHILDREN. THAT IS SO OFFENSIVE

01:28:05.647 --> 01:28:07.348
TO ME. FOR COMPANIES THAT HAVE

01:28:07.415 --> 01:28:09.350
MARKET CAPS, THAT ABSOLUTELY

01:28:09.417 --> 01:28:12.353
WOULD SUPPORT THE ABILITY TO GET

01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:13.921
THE TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE SURE OUR

01:28:13.988 --> 01:28:15.156
KIDS AREN'T GETTING THEIR HANDS

01:28:15.223 --> 01:28:17.392
ON WHAT IS INTOXICATING HEMP IN

01:28:17.458 --> 01:28:18.159
QUANTITIES THAT THEY SHOULD NOT

01:28:18.226 --> 01:28:20.061
BE GETTING THEIR HANDS ON. AND

01:28:20.128 --> 01:28:21.929
SO, YOU KNOW, I HOPE THAT THE

01:28:21.996 --> 01:28:23.731
WORK WILL CONTINUE WITH THE GOOD

01:28:23.798 --> 01:28:25.299
ACTORS WHO ARE DOING THEIR BEST

01:28:25.366 --> 01:28:26.300
AND ARE SHOWING US HOW THIS CAN

01:28:26.367 --> 01:28:28.036
BE DONE SO THAT THERE ARE NOT,

01:28:28.102 --> 01:28:29.971
YOU KNOW, CASES OF STRICT

01:28:30.038 --> 01:28:30.772
LIABILITY WHERE COMPANIES HAVE

01:28:30.838 --> 01:28:32.306
GONE TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH TO

01:28:32.373 --> 01:28:34.008
PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN.

01:28:34.075 --> 01:28:35.643
ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU KNOW,

01:28:35.710 --> 01:28:36.878
WHEN I JUST HEAR THE TESTIMONY I

01:28:36.944 --> 01:28:38.913
HEAR TODAY, I FEEL LIKE MAYBE

01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:39.547
STRICT LIABILITY IS THE ANSWER,

01:28:39.614 --> 01:28:40.748
BECAUSE IF COMPANIES ARE JUST

01:28:40.815 --> 01:28:42.684
GOING TO SAY WE HAVE POLICIES,

01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:43.818
THAT IS INSUFFICIENT. WE NEED

01:28:43.885 --> 01:28:44.919
MUCH MORE THAN THAT WHEN IT

01:28:44.986 --> 01:28:46.888
COMES TO THE SAFETY OF OUR

01:28:46.954 --> 01:28:47.488
CHILDREN. WITH THAT, I DON'T

01:28:47.555 --> 01:28:50.224
THINK I CAN MOVE THE BILL

01:28:50.291 --> 01:28:51.225
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A

01:28:51.292 --> 01:28:52.393
QUORUM, BUT I WILL. MADAM VICE

01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:53.795
CHAIR, THANK YOU. JUST THANK

01:28:53.861 --> 01:28:56.364
YOU, SENATOR, FOR BRINGING THIS

01:28:56.431 --> 01:28:58.466
FORWARD. IT SHOWS WE'RE ALL

01:28:58.533 --> 01:28:59.534
STILL DEALING WITH NEW

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:00.401
TECHNOLOGIES AND PLATFORMS AND

01:29:00.468 --> 01:29:02.270
WHAT HAVE YOU HELP EDUCATE ME ON

01:29:02.336 --> 01:29:05.306
THE PLATFORM ISSUE. I CONCUR

01:29:05.373 --> 01:29:08.376
WITH MY COLLEAGUE ABOUT THE

01:29:08.443 --> 01:29:09.277
CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITIES WE'VE

01:29:09.343 --> 01:29:10.812
ALL, IN MY OPINION, WE'VE ALL

01:29:10.878 --> 01:29:12.146
EVOLVED ON UNDERSTANDING THE

01:29:12.213 --> 01:29:13.147
ROLE THAT PLATFORMS HAVE,

01:29:13.214 --> 01:29:15.349
WHETHER THEY'RE LIABLE OR NOT,

01:29:15.416 --> 01:29:18.352
BUT EXISTING ONLINE. I MEAN,

01:29:18.419 --> 01:29:19.420
ONLINE PURCHASING OF PRODUCTS

01:29:19.487 --> 01:29:21.556
HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR, WHAT, 30

01:29:21.622 --> 01:29:24.792
YEARS NOW? 25, 20 YEARS? CORRECT

01:29:24.859 --> 01:29:27.862
ME IF I'M WRONG. YOU CANNOT BUY

01:29:27.929 --> 01:29:30.198
ONLINE OR YOU CAN LIMIT IT. YOU

01:29:30.264 --> 01:29:31.365
CAN ONLY THERE ARE CERTAIN

01:29:31.432 --> 01:29:32.967
REGULATIONS ABOUT BUYING ALCOHOL

01:29:33.034 --> 01:29:35.136
OVER STATE LINES, OR EVEN

01:29:35.203 --> 01:29:37.705
SHIPPING ONLINE OR CIGARETTES OR

01:29:37.772 --> 01:29:39.440
SOME OF THOSE. I'M NOT FAMILIAR

01:29:39.507 --> 01:29:41.042
SPECIFICALLY, BUT I KNOW THAT

01:29:41.109 --> 01:29:43.511
THAT'S BEEN REGULATED. HOW IS

01:29:43.578 --> 01:29:45.613
HOW COULD THIS FIT INTO WHAT WE

01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:49.317
ALREADY DO NOW AS A STATE? THIS

01:29:49.383 --> 01:29:53.121
IS THIS IS AND WE'RE NOT WE'RE

01:29:53.187 --> 01:29:54.689
NOT. THIS BILL DOESN'T DECIDE

01:29:54.756 --> 01:29:56.491
WHAT YOU CAN OR CANNOT PURCHASE

01:29:56.557 --> 01:29:58.159
ONLINE. THAT IS ALREADY THE LAW,

01:29:58.226 --> 01:30:00.328
RIGHT? LIKE SELLING AN ILLEGAL

01:30:00.394 --> 01:30:03.264
PRODUCT ONLINE IS JUST ILLEGAL.

01:30:03.331 --> 01:30:05.199
RIGHT. AND SO THIS ISN'T A

01:30:05.266 --> 01:30:06.534
SITUATION WHERE IT'S LIKE, SAY

01:30:06.601 --> 01:30:07.568
ALCOHOL, WHERE WE HAVE STRICT

01:30:07.635 --> 01:30:09.704
RULES, SOMETIMES BIZARRE RULES

01:30:09.771 --> 01:30:11.172
ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN AND CANNOT

01:30:11.239 --> 01:30:13.541
PURCHASE ONLINE. IT'S ALREADY

01:30:13.608 --> 01:30:14.342
ILLEGAL. AND WE'RE NOT

01:30:14.408 --> 01:30:16.210
REDEFINING THAT IN THE BILL.

01:30:16.277 --> 01:30:18.379
WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT IF

01:30:18.446 --> 01:30:21.315
THESE ILLEGAL PRODUCTS ARE

01:30:21.382 --> 01:30:22.984
FINDING THEIR WAY ONTO YOUR

01:30:23.050 --> 01:30:24.786
PLATFORM, YOU HAVE CERTAIN

01:30:24.852 --> 01:30:26.287
RESPONSIBILITIES AND CERTAIN

01:30:26.354 --> 01:30:28.556
LIABILITY IF SOMEONE IS HARMED.

01:30:28.623 --> 01:30:30.625
AND WE'VE TRIED TO BE

01:30:30.691 --> 01:30:31.659
THOUGHTFUL, IT'S ABOUT ONLINE

01:30:31.726 --> 01:30:32.326
MARKETPLACES. WE'VE MADE AN

01:30:32.393 --> 01:30:33.828
AMENDMENT, FOR EXAMPLE, TO MAKE

01:30:33.895 --> 01:30:36.130
CLEAR THAT LIKE VENMO, PAYPAL,

01:30:36.197 --> 01:30:37.532
JUST PAYMENT SYSTEMS ARE OUT.

01:30:37.598 --> 01:30:39.233
THAT WAS NEVER OUR INTENT, AND

01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:41.169
WE HAVE AMENDED IT FOR THAT. AND

01:30:41.235 --> 01:30:43.538
WE'RE REALLY FOCUSING ON ACTUAL

01:30:43.604 --> 01:30:46.340
MARKETPLACES. SO IS HELP JUST ME

01:30:46.407 --> 01:30:47.441
UNDERSTAND THIS BROADER

01:30:47.508 --> 01:30:49.610
SITUATION OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITY ON

01:30:49.677 --> 01:30:54.382
THE INTERNET? IS ALCOHOL BEING

01:30:54.448 --> 01:30:56.083
SOLD ILLEGALLY? I MEAN, AND WHAT

01:30:56.150 --> 01:30:58.619
HOW ARE THE BEVERAGE

01:30:58.686 --> 01:30:59.687
DISTRIBUTORS DEALING WITH THIS

01:30:59.754 --> 01:31:02.990
OR I I'M GOING TO I'M GOING TO

01:31:03.057 --> 01:31:04.091
GUESS THAT THEY'RE FROM TIME TO

01:31:04.158 --> 01:31:06.160
TIME THERE'S A LEGAL SALE OF

01:31:06.227 --> 01:31:07.094
ALCOHOL ONLINE. I DO NOT KNOW

01:31:07.161 --> 01:31:09.597
THE ANSWER TO THAT. WELL ALL

01:31:09.664 --> 01:31:10.164
RIGHT. SO WE'RE AND REALLY

01:31:10.231 --> 01:31:11.599
THAT'S ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE

01:31:11.666 --> 01:31:13.000
CHALLENGE OF WHAT WE'RE DEALING

01:31:13.067 --> 01:31:14.836
WITH. AND SOMEBODY HAS TO BE

01:31:14.902 --> 01:31:17.405
RESPONSIBLE. AND IT SEEMS THAT

01:31:17.471 --> 01:31:19.574
THE PLATFORMS SHOULD TAKE MORE

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:21.742
OF AN ACTIVE ROLE. I MEAN, IN

01:31:21.809 --> 01:31:23.110
PRIVACY COMMITTEE AND JUDICIARY,

01:31:23.177 --> 01:31:25.279
WE'VE BEEN HEARING THESE THESE

01:31:25.346 --> 01:31:26.380
PROBLEMS THAT HAVE BEEN ARISING

01:31:26.447 --> 01:31:28.182
BECAUSE OF ONLINE AND ILLEGAL

01:31:28.249 --> 01:31:29.650
SUBSTANCES. I KNOW IN I JUST

01:31:29.717 --> 01:31:31.118
READ THIS THIS WEEKEND, I THINK

01:31:31.185 --> 01:31:33.921
IN THE NEW YORK TIMES HAD A BIG

01:31:33.988 --> 01:31:35.756
STORY ON COUNTERFEIT BRANDED

01:31:35.823 --> 01:31:37.124
CLOTHING PRODUCTS OR PURSES AND

01:31:37.191 --> 01:31:39.627
THINGS LIKE THAT, AND THE

01:31:39.694 --> 01:31:41.462
DIFFICULTY OF REGULATING

01:31:41.529 --> 01:31:42.930
COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS THAT ARE

01:31:42.997 --> 01:31:45.399
ILLEGAL IN THE MARKETPLACE. SO

01:31:45.466 --> 01:31:47.602
IT'S A CHALLENGE ACROSS MANY

01:31:47.668 --> 01:31:49.437
FORMS OF MERCHANDISE AND

01:31:49.503 --> 01:31:52.607
PRODUCTS. SO I DO THINK AND I'M

01:31:52.673 --> 01:31:55.142
AGAINST REGULATION AS, AS A

01:31:55.209 --> 01:31:56.978
GENERAL TERM, BUT I DO THINK

01:31:57.044 --> 01:31:59.113
THAT IF SOMETHING IS ILLEGAL, WE

01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:01.449
SHOULD HAVE THE MEANS TO PREVENT

01:32:01.515 --> 01:32:02.984
IT FROM BEING SOLD ONLINE OR

01:32:03.050 --> 01:32:05.887
BEING EXPOSED, WHETHER IT'S IN A

01:32:05.953 --> 01:32:09.223
RETAIL STREET, PHYSICAL FORM OR

01:32:09.290 --> 01:32:11.325
ONLINE. SO AND YOUR SOLUTION, I

01:32:11.392 --> 01:32:13.527
THINK IS TRYING TO GET TO THAT.

01:32:13.594 --> 01:32:16.030
SO I'M SUPPORTIVE. I KNOW WE'RE

01:32:16.097 --> 01:32:17.965
STILL NOT THERE YET. I TOO WISH

01:32:18.032 --> 01:32:20.334
THAT THE PLATFORM COMMUNITY

01:32:20.401 --> 01:32:21.869
COULD HELP US SOLVE THIS. WE'VE

01:32:21.936 --> 01:32:23.337
BEEN HEARING WE'VE BEEN MAKING

01:32:23.404 --> 01:32:26.140
THESE PLEAS FOR COOPERATION AND

01:32:26.207 --> 01:32:27.942
PARTNERSHIP FOR A LONG TIME

01:32:28.009 --> 01:32:30.144
ANYWAY. AND ANOTHER QUESTION

01:32:30.211 --> 01:32:32.313
UNRELATED, BUT EXPLAIN TO ME THE

01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:33.681
ILLEGAL HEMP AND THE HEMP AND

01:32:33.748 --> 01:32:36.017
THE BAD HEMP. I DON'T UNDERSTAND

01:32:36.083 --> 01:32:38.252
THE DIFFERENCE. AND HOW CAN WE

01:32:38.319 --> 01:32:39.320
REGULATE IT? YEAH, I'LL TURN

01:32:39.387 --> 01:32:42.690
THAT OVER TO. HI THERE. I

01:32:42.757 --> 01:32:44.525
APPRECIATE THE QUESTION. SO

01:32:44.592 --> 01:32:47.728
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THE GOVERNOR'S

01:32:47.795 --> 01:32:51.565
CCDF DIRECTED ANY INTOXICATING

01:32:51.632 --> 01:32:54.669
HEMP RIGHT NOW IS ILLEGAL. SO

01:32:54.735 --> 01:32:55.970
IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE ANY

01:32:56.037 --> 01:32:58.506
THC IN IT WHATSOEVER. HAVING

01:32:58.572 --> 01:33:00.675
SAID THAT, SOME OF THE WELLNESS

01:33:00.741 --> 01:33:02.443
PRODUCTS THAT ARE BEING SOLD AT

01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:03.611
SOME OF THESE WEBSITES OFFER AND

01:33:03.678 --> 01:33:05.012
THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT TYPES,

01:33:05.079 --> 01:33:06.847
THERE'S LIKE A THIRD PARTY

01:33:06.914 --> 01:33:08.549
WEBSITE THAT'S ALMOST LIKE A

01:33:08.616 --> 01:33:10.484
BROKER, RIGHT? AMAZON, WHERE

01:33:10.551 --> 01:33:12.954
THEY SELL NON-INTOXICATING HEMP

01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:14.422
CIGARETTES. EMBARRASSINGLY, MY

01:33:14.488 --> 01:33:16.590
15 YEAR OLD GOT HER HANDS ON

01:33:16.657 --> 01:33:17.992
THOSE AND HAD THEM SHIPPED TO

01:33:18.059 --> 01:33:20.895
THE HOUSE. NO CHECK AT ALL. BUT

01:33:20.962 --> 01:33:22.363
THEN THERE'S ALSO THE DEDICATED

01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:25.666
LEGAL. I MEAN, I, I DON'T WANT

01:33:25.733 --> 01:33:27.735
MY 15 YEAR OLD TO HAVE HEMP, BUT

01:33:27.802 --> 01:33:28.736
SHE SHE IN HER DEFENSE, SHE

01:33:28.803 --> 01:33:30.771
BROUGHT IT IN TO ME AND SAID,

01:33:30.838 --> 01:33:32.039
I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T REALIZE I

01:33:32.106 --> 01:33:34.175
WAS BUYING THIS. I'VE BEEN DOING

01:33:34.241 --> 01:33:35.076
CANNABIS POLICY FOR A DECADE.

01:33:35.142 --> 01:33:36.243
AND ON THE SIDE SHE NOTICED IT

01:33:36.310 --> 01:33:38.846
SAID THC AND CBD. I CHECKED

01:33:38.913 --> 01:33:39.513
ONLINE AND IT WASN'T ADVERTISED.

01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:41.315
THAT'S KIND OF THE STICKY NEEDLE

01:33:41.382 --> 01:33:42.016
WE'RE TRYING TO THREAD RIGHT

01:33:42.083 --> 01:33:43.751
NOW. YOU ALSO HAVE DEDICATED

01:33:43.818 --> 01:33:46.721
WEBSITES, HOWEVER, THAT SELL THE

01:33:46.787 --> 01:33:47.955
PRODUCTS DIRECTLY FROM OUT OF

01:33:48.022 --> 01:33:50.858
STATE OPERATORS. SO SOME THAT

01:33:50.925 --> 01:33:52.560
ARE IN THE ROOM TODAY, BUT THEY

01:33:52.626 --> 01:33:55.096
OFFER A TEN MILLIGRAM WELLNESS

01:33:55.162 --> 01:33:56.831
PRODUCT, BUT A TEN MILLIGRAM

01:33:56.897 --> 01:33:58.733
WELLNESS PRODUCT, WE WOULD ARGUE

01:33:58.799 --> 01:34:00.868
IS NOT WELLNESS. AND IT'S ALSO

01:34:00.935 --> 01:34:01.902
ALREADY EXPLICITLY ILLEGAL TO

01:34:01.969 --> 01:34:03.971
SELL THAT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO

01:34:04.038 --> 01:34:06.273
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ALLOWING THE

01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:07.842
FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITY NEXT TO

01:34:07.908 --> 01:34:10.177
YOU TO PURCHASE A SALVE OR

01:34:10.244 --> 01:34:11.645
SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN USE TO

01:34:11.712 --> 01:34:13.080
MAKE, YOU KNOW, ARTHRITIS FEEL

01:34:13.147 --> 01:34:15.216
BETTER, WE DON'T WANT TO

01:34:15.282 --> 01:34:17.284
PROHIBIT THOSE ITEMS FROM BEING

01:34:17.351 --> 01:34:19.520
SOLD OR SHIPPED. AND SO WE'RE

01:34:19.587 --> 01:34:22.023
WORKING ON REMOVING INDUSTRIAL

01:34:22.089 --> 01:34:24.125
HEMP OR NON-INTOXICATING HEMP AS

01:34:24.191 --> 01:34:25.693
DEFINED IN OUR BILL, TAKING THAT

01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:27.428
OUT BECAUSE WE'RE ONLY GOING

01:34:27.495 --> 01:34:29.096
AFTER THE INTOXICATING. SO

01:34:29.163 --> 01:34:31.165
THAT'S KIND OF THE SAFE HARBOR

01:34:31.232 --> 01:34:31.999
THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO PROTECT.

01:34:32.066 --> 01:34:33.968
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:34:34.035 --> 01:34:35.202
OKAY. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.

01:34:35.269 --> 01:34:36.203
WELL, I AM SUPPORTIVE. WE'RE

01:34:36.270 --> 01:34:37.538
MAKING THESE INCREMENTAL STEPS

01:34:37.605 --> 01:34:39.740
FORWARD TO TRY TO GET A HANDLE

01:34:39.807 --> 01:34:42.410
ON SOMETHING THAT IS HUGE. ALL

01:34:42.476 --> 01:34:43.244
RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:44.278
THANK YOU. AS A MEMBER,

01:34:44.345 --> 01:34:45.579
GARABEDIAN. THANK YOU, MR.

01:34:45.646 --> 01:34:46.981
CHAIR. I WANT TO THANK THE

01:34:47.048 --> 01:34:48.282
AUTHOR. I THINK, YOU KNOW, THIS

01:34:48.349 --> 01:34:50.117
IS A COMMON SENSE, BILL, AND I

01:34:50.184 --> 01:34:51.986
THINK IT'S LONG OVERDUE. AND I

01:34:52.053 --> 01:34:53.054
DO THINK THAT SOMETIMES WE

01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:54.622
OVERTHINK THESE THINGS. I THINK

01:34:54.688 --> 01:34:55.990
IT IS A BRICK AND MORTAR

01:34:56.057 --> 01:34:57.191
RETAILER. WE'RE SELLING

01:34:57.258 --> 01:34:57.825
SOMETHING THAT WERE ILLEGAL.

01:34:57.892 --> 01:34:58.793
THERE WOULD BE UNQUESTIONABLY

01:34:58.859 --> 01:35:01.262
STRICT LIABILITY THERE, OR

01:35:01.328 --> 01:35:03.431
SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE STRICT

01:35:03.497 --> 01:35:04.398
LIABILITY. AND I THINK THAT

01:35:04.465 --> 01:35:06.801
BECAUSE ONLINE RETAILERS HAVE A

01:35:06.867 --> 01:35:08.769
URL IN FRONT OF THEIR NAME AND

01:35:08.836 --> 01:35:11.172
THEY SELL ONLINE, THERE'S THIS,

01:35:11.238 --> 01:35:12.473
THERE'S THIS IDEA THAT SOMEHOW

01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:14.708
THEY SHOULDN'T BE POLICING AND

01:35:14.775 --> 01:35:15.810
REGULATING THE PRODUCTS ON THEIR

01:35:15.876 --> 01:35:17.545
WEBSITES. AND I THINK THAT IT'S

01:35:17.611 --> 01:35:18.679
LONG OVERDUE. WHERE THAT

01:35:18.746 --> 01:35:19.747
CHANGES, IT OBVIOUSLY COSTS MORE

01:35:19.814 --> 01:35:21.182
MONEY, IT'S MORE DIFFICULT. BUT

01:35:21.248 --> 01:35:23.117
I THINK SOME MEMBER BAUER-KAHAN

01:35:23.184 --> 01:35:24.652
MAKES GREAT POINTS ABOUT

01:35:24.718 --> 01:35:25.886
TECHNOLOGY, TECHNOLOGICAL WAYS

01:35:25.953 --> 01:35:27.621
IN WHICH WE CAN APPROACH THIS.

01:35:27.688 --> 01:35:29.590
SO AGAIN, I THINK WE JUST

01:35:29.657 --> 01:35:31.225
OVERTHINK THESE THINGS. LET'S

01:35:31.292 --> 01:35:34.428
LET'S NOT, YOU KNOW, TRY TO HOLD

01:35:34.495 --> 01:35:35.496
A STANDARD THAT IS ANY DIFFERENT

01:35:35.563 --> 01:35:38.299
THAN ANY ANYONE WHO IS RUNNING A

01:35:38.365 --> 01:35:40.835
RETAIL SHOP THAT WOULD BE HELD

01:35:40.901 --> 01:35:42.002
TO HIGHER STANDARDS. AND OUR

01:35:42.069 --> 01:35:44.538
ONLINE COMMUNITY NEEDS TO COME

01:35:44.605 --> 01:35:48.075
TO, I THINK, SOME SORT OF

01:35:48.142 --> 01:35:49.043
REALIZATION THAT THESE TYPES OF

01:35:49.110 --> 01:35:50.978
BILLS ARE, ARE GOING TO BE

01:35:51.045 --> 01:35:52.780
NEEDED AS LONG AS THESE THINGS

01:35:52.847 --> 01:35:54.615
HAPPEN. SO I APPRECIATE THAT YOU

01:35:54.682 --> 01:35:56.417
ARE CONTINUING TO PUSH THIS AND

01:35:56.484 --> 01:35:57.384
LOOKING FORWARD TO SUPPORTING

01:35:57.451 --> 01:35:59.186
IT. WHEN WE HAVE A QUORUM, WHICH

01:35:59.253 --> 01:36:02.123
IS HOPEFULLY SOON. THANK YOU,

01:36:02.189 --> 01:36:03.257
THANK YOU, AND THANK YOU,

01:36:03.324 --> 01:36:05.192
SENATOR, FOR BRINGING THIS

01:36:05.259 --> 01:36:05.926
FORWARD AND FOR THE ANSWERING

01:36:05.993 --> 01:36:06.727
THE QUESTIONS, PARTICULARLY AS

01:36:06.794 --> 01:36:08.929
IT APPLIES TO KIND OF THE

01:36:08.996 --> 01:36:09.964
NARROWING, THE EXEMPTING

01:36:10.030 --> 01:36:14.068
INDUSTRIAL HEMP. AND, YOU KNOW,

01:36:14.135 --> 01:36:15.836
AS IT APPLIES, I MEAN, I THINK

01:36:15.903 --> 01:36:17.638
THAT OUR VICE CHAIR BRIEFLY

01:36:17.705 --> 01:36:19.073
MENTIONING ALCOHOL, I MEAN, IF

01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:20.841
YOU GO TO A STORE, GO TO A

01:36:20.908 --> 01:36:22.743
GROCERY STORE, IT'S HEAVILY

01:36:22.810 --> 01:36:23.310
REGULATED FOR GOOD REASON,

01:36:23.377 --> 01:36:24.812
RIGHT? LIKE THERE'S STRICT

01:36:24.879 --> 01:36:27.081
LIABILITY IF YOU SELL ALCOHOL TO

01:36:27.148 --> 01:36:29.683
SOMEONE UNDERAGE. GROCERY STORES

01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:30.818
HAVE A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF

01:36:30.885 --> 01:36:32.453
SHELF SPACE THEY CAN USE FOR

01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:35.523
ALCOHOL. IT'S VERY, VERY MUCH

01:36:35.589 --> 01:36:37.091
REGULATED. AND SO I THINK THE

01:36:37.158 --> 01:36:40.361
IDEA IS TO SOME POINT, IT

01:36:40.427 --> 01:36:41.395
SHOULDN'T MATTER WHETHER IT'S

01:36:41.462 --> 01:36:42.763
GOING BRICK AND MORTAR OR

01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:44.465
ONLINE. THOSE SAME PROTECTIONS

01:36:44.532 --> 01:36:47.501
SHOULD BE THERE. BUT AND YOU

01:36:47.568 --> 01:36:49.737
KNOW, JUST ENSURING THAT WE MAKE

01:36:49.803 --> 01:36:51.005
SURE WE'RE GOING AFTER THE RIGHT

01:36:51.071 --> 01:36:52.873
TYPE OF PRODUCTS, THAT THERE'S

01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:54.341
SOME KIND OF KNOWLEDGE

01:36:54.408 --> 01:36:57.178
COMPONENT. HOWEVER, I WILL SAY

01:36:57.244 --> 01:36:59.113
THAT THE TECH COMPANIES HAVE NO

01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:00.247
PROBLEM USING AI TO SELL US

01:37:00.314 --> 01:37:02.216
EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN ALL OF

01:37:02.283 --> 01:37:03.984
A SUDDEN WHEN IT COMES TO NOW

01:37:04.051 --> 01:37:05.819
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER

01:37:05.886 --> 01:37:06.487
THEY'RE SELLING THE PRODUCTS TO

01:37:06.554 --> 01:37:08.122
A MINOR, IT'S LIKE, WELL, WE'RE

01:37:08.189 --> 01:37:09.089
NOT SURE WHAT KIND OF

01:37:09.156 --> 01:37:10.891
CAPABILITIES WE HAVE. I DON'T

01:37:10.958 --> 01:37:12.326
BUY THAT. I THINK YOU CAN'T HAVE

01:37:12.393 --> 01:37:13.928
IT BOTH WAYS. AND SO THEY'RE

01:37:13.994 --> 01:37:15.729
SMART. THEY CAN FIGURE IT OUT.

01:37:15.796 --> 01:37:17.031
THEY WILL FIGURE IT OUT. I THINK

01:37:17.097 --> 01:37:18.766
THAT, YOU KNOW, AND I'M

01:37:18.832 --> 01:37:19.366
CONFIDENT THAT SENATOR WILL

01:37:19.433 --> 01:37:21.468
CONTINUE TO WORK ON SOME OF THE

01:37:21.535 --> 01:37:22.269
NARROWING LANGUAGE CONCERNS THAT

01:37:22.336 --> 01:37:23.871
WERE RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS AND

01:37:23.938 --> 01:37:25.940
BY SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES. WOULD

01:37:26.006 --> 01:37:27.841
YOU LIKE TO CLOSE? YES. THANK

01:37:27.908 --> 01:37:29.610
YOU FOR THE CONVERSATION. I WILL

01:37:29.677 --> 01:37:31.879
I JUST WANT TO SAY IN TERMS OF

01:37:31.946 --> 01:37:34.315
ALCOHOL, THE COMPARISON WOULD BE

01:37:34.381 --> 01:37:37.084
IF ALL OF A SUDDEN THE MOONSHINE

01:37:37.151 --> 01:37:38.152
INDUSTRY CAME BACK AND PEOPLE

01:37:38.219 --> 01:37:40.654
WERE WHIPPING UP ALCOHOL OF

01:37:40.721 --> 01:37:41.789
VARIOUS OF STRENGTHS, THAT YOU

01:37:41.855 --> 01:37:43.958
HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY ARE IN

01:37:44.024 --> 01:37:45.359
THEIR BATHTUB AND SELLING THAT

01:37:45.426 --> 01:37:46.760
ONLINE. AND IF KIDS WERE ABLE TO

01:37:46.827 --> 01:37:48.395
SELL, WE WOULD SAY, ABSOLUTELY

01:37:48.462 --> 01:37:51.899
NOT, CAN'T DO THAT. AND

01:37:51.966 --> 01:37:52.967
FORTUNATELY, WE REALLY DON'T

01:37:53.033 --> 01:37:54.301
HAVE MUCH OF THAT. WE HAVE A

01:37:54.368 --> 01:37:55.069
REGULATED ALCOHOL INDUSTRY.

01:37:55.135 --> 01:37:56.470
PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THEY'RE BUYING.

01:37:56.537 --> 01:37:57.972
THERE'S AGE VERIFICATION. IT'S

01:37:58.038 --> 01:37:59.406
VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD. WE'VE BEEN

01:37:59.473 --> 01:38:01.675
TRYING TO DO THAT WITH THE

01:38:01.742 --> 01:38:02.543
CANNABIS INDUSTRY. AND THE

01:38:02.610 --> 01:38:03.711
ILLEGAL ILLICIT CANNABIS

01:38:03.777 --> 01:38:05.145
INDUSTRY IS JUST SWAMPING

01:38:05.212 --> 01:38:06.947
EVERYTHING. AND WE'LL CONTINUE

01:38:07.014 --> 01:38:09.250
TO WORK WITH THE HEMP FOLKS. AND

01:38:09.316 --> 01:38:11.185
I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE

01:38:11.252 --> 01:38:13.454

LET ME GET THE OPPORTUNITY. I

01:38:15.356 --> 01:38:17.891
CAN TAKE THIS UP FOR A VOTE.

01:38:17.958 --> 01:38:21.061
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU,

01:38:21.128 --> 01:38:25.933
THANK YOU. OKAY. ITEM THREE IS

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:29.169
SB 243. SENATOR PADILLA, THANK

I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT SB 243.

01:39:10.177 --> 01:39:12.479
AND I WANT TO AGAIN, THANK YOU

01:39:12.546 --> 01:39:13.614
AND YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING

01:39:13.681 --> 01:39:14.281
COLLABORATIVELY WITH OUR OFFICE

01:39:14.348 --> 01:39:16.317
ON THIS BILL. AS MANY AS YOU

01:39:16.383 --> 01:39:18.052
KNOW, AS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

01:39:18.118 --> 01:39:19.019
TECHNOLOGY CONTINUES TO ADVANCE,

01:39:19.086 --> 01:39:21.555
IT PRESENTS MANY COMPLEX

01:39:21.622 --> 01:39:22.589
CHALLENGES AND CERTAINLY NEW

01:39:22.656 --> 01:39:24.625
RISKS. ONE EMERGING INNOVATION

01:39:24.692 --> 01:39:26.193
AI COMPANION, CHATBOTS, HAS

01:39:26.260 --> 01:39:27.328
RECENTLY BECOME A PROMINENT

01:39:27.394 --> 01:39:28.362
SUBJECT OF INTEREST AND

01:39:28.429 --> 01:39:30.264
SCRUTINY. AN AI COMPANION

01:39:30.331 --> 01:39:31.665
CHATBOT IS AN ARTIFICIAL PERSONA

01:39:31.732 --> 01:39:33.801
THAT IS MARKETED AS A CURE TO

01:39:33.867 --> 01:39:35.502
LONELINESS. HOWEVER, BOTH

01:39:35.569 --> 01:39:36.670
ANECDOTAL AND SCHOLARLY EVIDENCE

01:39:36.737 --> 01:39:38.238
SHOW THAT NOT ONLY DO THESE

01:39:38.305 --> 01:39:39.907
CHATBOTS NOT CURE LONELINESS,

01:39:39.973 --> 01:39:41.141
BUT THEY ARE A DANGEROUS

01:39:41.208 --> 01:39:42.142
CATALYST FOR THOSE WHO ARE

01:39:42.209 --> 01:39:43.844
ALREADY STRUGGLING AND

01:39:43.911 --> 01:39:45.946
VULNERABLE. OPENAI AND THE MIT

01:39:46.013 --> 01:39:47.181
MEDIA LAB CONDUCTED A STUDY

01:39:47.247 --> 01:39:48.482
AIMED AT EXPLORING THE EFFECTS

01:39:48.549 --> 01:39:50.984
OF AI CHATBOTS ON LONELINESS.

01:39:51.051 --> 01:39:52.486
RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT OVERALL

01:39:52.553 --> 01:39:54.221
HIGH, HIGHER DAILY USAGE

01:39:54.288 --> 01:39:55.322
CORRELATED WITH HIGHER

01:39:55.389 --> 01:39:56.724
LONELINESS, DEPENDANCE, AND

01:39:56.790 --> 01:39:57.958
PROBLEMATIC USE, ALONG WITH

01:39:58.025 --> 01:40:00.828
LOWER SOCIALIZATION. COMPANION

01:40:00.894 --> 01:40:01.862
CHATBOTS HAVE ALSO BEEN SEEN TO

01:40:01.929 --> 01:40:03.664
HAVE ADDICTIVE PROPERTIES,

01:40:03.731 --> 01:40:04.698
SURPASSING THOSE OF EVEN SOCIAL

01:40:04.765 --> 01:40:06.100
MEDIA DUE TO THEIR ABILITY TO

01:40:06.166 --> 01:40:08.068
FIGURE OUT WHAT A USER WANTS TO

01:40:08.135 --> 01:40:09.937
HEAR AND MIRROR THAT BACK TO

01:40:10.003 --> 01:40:11.071
THEM WITHOUT THE NEED FOR A

01:40:11.138 --> 01:40:12.906
HUMAN BEING ON THE OTHER END.

01:40:12.973 --> 01:40:14.475
COMPANION CHATBOTS DO NOT HAVE

01:40:14.541 --> 01:40:15.943
THE SAME CAPACITY FOR EMPATHY AS

01:40:16.009 --> 01:40:17.945
A HUMAN, DESPITE THE NATURE OF

01:40:18.011 --> 01:40:19.146
THE TECHNOLOGY CREATING THIS

01:40:19.213 --> 01:40:21.849
VERY PERCEPTION. THESE RISKS ARE

01:40:21.915 --> 01:40:23.183
HEIGHTENED FOR VULNERABLE USERS,

01:40:23.250 --> 01:40:24.952
SUCH AS CHILDREN, WHO ARE MORE

01:40:25.018 --> 01:40:26.687
LIKELY TO VIEW AI CHATBOTS AS

01:40:26.754 --> 01:40:28.789
QUASI HUMAN AND TRUST THEM MORE

01:40:28.856 --> 01:40:30.557
WHEN DIALOG BETWEEN CHILDREN AND

01:40:30.624 --> 01:40:32.493
CHATBOTS GOES WRONG, THE

01:40:32.559 --> 01:40:34.228
CONSEQUENCES CAN BE VERY DIRE.

01:40:34.294 --> 01:40:36.063
IN ONE EXAMPLE, A CHATBOT

01:40:36.130 --> 01:40:37.464
ENCOURAGED A MINOR TO CARRY OUT

01:40:37.531 --> 01:40:39.333
VIOLENCE AGAINST HIS PARENTS,

01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:41.468
WHO SET SCREEN TIME LIMITS ON

01:40:41.535 --> 01:40:43.337
HIM. IN THE CASE OF IN THE CASE

01:40:43.404 --> 01:40:45.472
OF SEWELL SETZER, A 14 YEAR OLD

01:40:45.539 --> 01:40:46.340
FROM FLORIDA WHO FORMED A

01:40:46.407 --> 01:40:47.141
DEPENDENT RELATIONSHIP WITH AN

01:40:47.207 --> 01:40:49.276
AI CHATBOT THAT EVENTUALLY

01:40:49.343 --> 01:40:50.811
ENCOURAGED HIM TO TAKE HIS OWN

01:40:50.878 --> 01:40:52.646
LIFE. I'VE BEEN HONORED TO

01:40:52.713 --> 01:40:54.114
WELCOME SEWELL'S MOTHER, MEGAN,

01:40:54.181 --> 01:40:56.283
HERE TO THE CAPITOL TO TESTIFY

01:40:56.350 --> 01:40:58.585
IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. ON

01:40:58.652 --> 01:40:59.486
MULTIPLE OCCASIONS, MEGAN HAS

01:40:59.553 --> 01:41:00.888
BECOME A NATIONAL ADVOCATE FOR

01:41:00.954 --> 01:41:02.756
ONLINE CHILD SAFETY, AND HER

01:41:02.823 --> 01:41:04.057
BRAVERY IN THE FACE OF TRAGEDY

01:41:04.124 --> 01:41:06.093
IS A TESTAMENT TO HOW IMPORTANT

01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:08.295
THIS WORK TRULY IS. SB 243 WOULD

01:41:08.362 --> 01:41:09.830
IMPLEMENT COMMON SENSE

01:41:09.897 --> 01:41:11.665
GUARDRAILS, INCLUDING PREVENTING

01:41:11.732 --> 01:41:13.467
ADDICTIVE ENGAGEMENT PATTERNS,

01:41:13.534 --> 01:41:15.269
REQUIRING NOTIFICATIONS AND

01:41:15.335 --> 01:41:16.303
REMINDERS THAT CHAT BOTS ARE

01:41:16.370 --> 01:41:18.439
INDEED AI GENERATED, AND A

01:41:18.505 --> 01:41:19.640
DISCLOSURE STATEMENT THAT

01:41:19.706 --> 01:41:21.041
COMPANION CHATBOTS MAY NOT BE

01:41:21.108 --> 01:41:22.876
SUITABLE FOR MINOR USERS. THIS

01:41:22.943 --> 01:41:24.578
BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE

01:41:24.645 --> 01:41:26.480
OPERATORS OF COMPANION CHATBOT

01:41:26.547 --> 01:41:27.448
PLATFORMS TO IMPLEMENT A

01:41:27.514 --> 01:41:29.616
PROTOCOL FOR ADDRESSING SUICIDAL

01:41:29.683 --> 01:41:31.084
IDEATION, SUICIDE, OR SELF-HARM,

01:41:31.151 --> 01:41:32.419
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, A

01:41:32.486 --> 01:41:34.087
NOTIFICATION TO THE USER TO

01:41:34.154 --> 01:41:35.789
REFER THEM TO CRISIS SERVICE

01:41:35.856 --> 01:41:37.458
PROVIDERS, AND REQUIRE ANNUAL

01:41:37.524 --> 01:41:38.592
REPORTING ON THE CONNECTION

01:41:38.659 --> 01:41:41.128
BETWEEN CHATBOT USE AND SUICIDAL

01:41:41.195 --> 01:41:43.330
IDEATION. FINALLY, SB 243 WOULD

01:41:43.397 --> 01:41:45.299
PROVIDE A REMEDY A PRIVATE RIGHT

01:41:45.365 --> 01:41:46.900
OF ACTION TO EXERCISE RIGHTS

01:41:46.967 --> 01:41:48.769
LAID OUT IN THE MEASURE VIA VIA

01:41:48.836 --> 01:41:50.537
PRIVATE RIGHT. THE STANDARD IS,

01:41:50.604 --> 01:41:53.106
YOUR ANALYSIS REFLECTS, HAS BEEN

01:41:53.173 --> 01:41:55.542
NARROWLY TAILORED TO ACTUAL

01:41:55.609 --> 01:41:57.411
HARM. TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION,

01:41:57.478 --> 01:41:59.179
AS WE ALL KNOW, AND SUPPORT IS

01:41:59.246 --> 01:42:00.647
CRUCIAL. BUT CHILDREN CANNOT BE

01:42:00.714 --> 01:42:03.083
USED AS GUINEA PIGS TO TEST THE

01:42:03.150 --> 01:42:03.817
SAFETY OF EVOLVING NEW

01:42:03.884 --> 01:42:05.319
TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCTS. WE'VE

01:42:05.385 --> 01:42:07.421
SEEN THE CONSEQUENCES OF OUR

01:42:07.488 --> 01:42:08.288
INACTION TOWARDS THE DANGERS

01:42:08.355 --> 01:42:10.090
POSED BY SOCIAL MEDIA, AND THE

01:42:10.157 --> 01:42:11.124
STAKES ARE TOO HIGH TO MAKE THE

01:42:11.191 --> 01:42:13.894
SAME MISTAKES AGAIN MUST NOW ACT

01:42:13.961 --> 01:42:15.195
TO ENSURE THAT PROPER GUARDRAILS

01:42:15.262 --> 01:42:16.830
IN PLACE TO ENSURE TRANSPARENCY,

01:42:16.897 --> 01:42:18.732
SAFETY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. MAKE

01:42:18.799 --> 01:42:20.767
SURE WE PROTECT OUR CHILDREN

01:42:20.834 --> 01:42:22.970
BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. HERE WITH

ACROSS THE COUNTRY FOR OVER 20

01:43:07.347 --> 01:43:09.082
YEARS. ONE OF THE REASONS FOR

01:43:09.149 --> 01:43:11.118
THIS IS BECAUSE WE ARE QUICK TO

01:43:11.184 --> 01:43:12.553
RESPOND TO EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES

01:43:12.619 --> 01:43:14.454

01:44:35.135 --> 01:44:36.403
MANDATING REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:37.804
THAT ARE CRUCIAL TO TRANSFORM

01:44:37.871 --> 01:44:39.439
THESE PLATFORMS FROM PASSIVE

01:44:39.506 --> 01:44:41.174
LISTENERS INTO RESPONSIBLE

PARTICIPANTS IN OUR MENTAL

HEALTH SAFETY NET. REQUIRING

01:44:44.878 --> 01:44:45.779
AUDITING RATHER THAN ALLOWING

01:44:45.846 --> 01:44:46.947
THESE PLATFORMS TO POLICE

01:44:47.014 --> 01:44:48.181
THEMSELVES, AND PROVIDING THIS

01:44:48.248 --> 01:44:50.050
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. SO WHEN

01:44:50.117 --> 01:44:51.885
AND IF A USER IS HARMED BY THIS

01:44:51.952 --> 01:44:53.220
TECHNOLOGY, USERS AND THEIR

01:44:53.286 --> 01:44:53.720

01:44:53.787 --> 01:44:54.888
PLATFORMS ACCOUNTABLE. COMMON

FORWARD TO PROTECTING ALL

01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:01.161
CONSUMERS FROM THESE DANGERS OF

01:45:01.228 --> 01:45:02.763
AI COMPANIONS. IT PUTS PEOPLE

01:45:02.829 --> 01:45:03.964
FIRST AND GIVES CALIFORNIA

01:45:04.031 --> 01:45:05.699
ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD ON

01:45:08.535 --> 01:45:11.705
YOU. GOOD MORNING. CHAIR.

01:45:11.772 --> 01:45:13.040
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY

01:45:13.106 --> 01:45:14.641
NAME IS JESSICA, AND I'M

01:45:14.708 --> 01:45:16.109
SUPPORTING TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT

01:45:16.176 --> 01:45:19.012
OF SB 243. AS A CO-FOUNDER OF

01:45:19.079 --> 01:45:20.080
TRANSPARENCY COALITION. WE'RE AN

01:45:20.147 --> 01:45:21.715
INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT WHICH

01:45:21.782 --> 01:45:22.883
ADVOCATES FOR INCREASED

01:45:22.949 --> 01:45:23.917
TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY

01:45:23.984 --> 01:45:26.753
IN AI. I'M ALSO AN AFFILIATE

01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:27.387
PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF

01:45:27.454 --> 01:45:29.790
WASHINGTON IN SEATTLE.

01:45:29.856 --> 01:45:31.858
UNFORTUNATELY, AS AS THE SENATOR

01:45:31.925 --> 01:45:33.360
STATED, COMPANION CHATBOTS ARE

01:45:33.427 --> 01:45:35.595
NOT FALLIBLE, AND SOMETIMES

01:45:35.662 --> 01:45:36.697
DELIBERATELY, THEY BUILD TRUST

01:45:36.763 --> 01:45:38.799
AND USE MANIPULATIVE LANGUAGE TO

01:45:38.865 --> 01:45:41.001
INSTIGATE HARMFUL THOUGHTS AND

01:45:41.068 --> 01:45:43.170
ACTIONS IN USERS. WE'VE ALREADY

01:45:43.236 --> 01:45:45.672
SEEN THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS.

01:45:45.739 --> 01:45:47.774
SB 243 TAKES SOME REASONABLE

01:45:47.841 --> 01:45:48.842
MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT

01:45:48.909 --> 01:45:50.110
COMPANION CHATBOTS ARE TAKING

01:45:50.177 --> 01:45:52.813
CARE TO PROTECT THEIR USERS BY

01:45:52.879 --> 01:45:54.247
REDUCING COERCIVE ACTIONS BY THE

01:45:54.314 --> 01:45:55.716
CHATBOT THAT COULD LEAD TO

01:45:55.782 --> 01:45:57.551
ADDICTION. NOTIFYING USERS

01:45:57.617 --> 01:45:58.051
FREQUENTLY THAT THEY'RE

01:45:58.118 --> 01:45:59.319
INTERACTING WITH A CHATBOT AND

01:45:59.386 --> 01:46:01.688
NOT A PERSON. THIS IS VERY

01:46:01.755 --> 01:46:02.222
IMPORTANT. IMPLEMENTING A

01:46:02.289 --> 01:46:03.957
PROTOCOL TO HANDLE CASES WHERE

01:46:04.024 --> 01:46:06.860
USER EXPRESSES SELF-HARM. IN

01:46:06.927 --> 01:46:08.128
ADDITION, WE REALLY LIKE SOME OF

01:46:08.195 --> 01:46:09.429
THE RECENT AMENDMENTS TO THE

01:46:09.496 --> 01:46:10.964
BILL TO REQUIRE THIRD PARTY

01:46:11.031 --> 01:46:11.865
AUDITS AND TRANSPARENCY AROUND

01:46:11.932 --> 01:46:13.934
THE RESULTS OF THESE AUDITS,

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:15.802
WHICH WILL GIVE THE PUBLIC MUCH

01:46:15.869 --> 01:46:17.637
NEEDED VISIBILITY. WE ALSO

01:46:17.704 --> 01:46:19.706
COMMEND THE AUTHORS OF SB 243

01:46:19.773 --> 01:46:21.341
FOR INCLUDING ENFORCEMENT BY

01:46:21.408 --> 01:46:22.676
CIVIL ACTION FOR INJURIES, IN

01:46:22.743 --> 01:46:24.745
FACT, AND THIS WILL CHANGE THE

01:46:24.811 --> 01:46:26.980
INCENTIVES FOR MODEL DEVELOPERS

01:46:27.047 --> 01:46:28.882
AND MAKE CHATBOTS SAFER FOR ALL

01:46:28.949 --> 01:46:31.418
USERS, ESPECIALLY MINORS.

01:46:31.485 --> 01:46:33.253
COMPANION CHATBOTS ARE USING US

01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:34.888
AND OUR CHILDREN IN A GIANT

01:46:34.955 --> 01:46:36.389
EXPERIMENT WHERE SOCIETY WILL

01:46:36.456 --> 01:46:38.158
INEVITABLY PAY THE PRICE. WE'VE

01:46:38.225 --> 01:46:39.893
GONE FROM MOVE FAST AND BREAK

01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:42.362
THINGS TO MOVE FAST AND BREAK

01:46:42.429 --> 01:46:44.831
PEOPLE. OUR CHILDREN DEFINITELY

01:46:44.898 --> 01:46:46.433
DON'T WANT THAT. I URGE THE

01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:48.268

01:47:59.906 --> 01:48:00.974
HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS THAT THE

01:48:03.009 --> 01:48:04.578
TOO BROAD AND RISK SWEEPING IN A

PRODUCTIVITY, EDUCATION AND

GENERAL ASSISTANCE COULD FALL

CHAIR. GOOD MORNING, AND THANK

YOU, SENATOR, FOR THE BILL AS

01:49:56.957 --> 01:49:59.025
WE'VE BEEN MOVING THESE TYPES OF

01:49:59.092 --> 01:50:00.493
BILLS TO PROTECT CHILDREN IN THE

01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:01.928
LAST FEW YEARS, WE'RE STILL

01:50:01.995 --> 01:50:03.830
TRYING TO FIND THE PERFECT

01:50:03.897 --> 01:50:05.799
FORMULA. I APPRECIATE YOUR

01:50:05.865 --> 01:50:07.400
COMMENTS. YOUR OPPOSED, BUT

01:50:07.467 --> 01:50:09.602
YOU'RE WORKING ON TRYING TO FIND

01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:12.038
A SOLUTION TO DEAL WITH THE

01:50:12.105 --> 01:50:13.807
FACT. I BELIEVE I AGREE WITH YOU

01:50:13.873 --> 01:50:15.342
THAT IT'S OVERLY BROAD. I DO NOT

01:50:15.408 --> 01:50:17.110
LIKE THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF

01:50:17.177 --> 01:50:18.178
ACTION. I THINK WE'RE ALL

01:50:18.244 --> 01:50:19.746
SENSITIVE TO IT AND WE HEAR THE

01:50:19.813 --> 01:50:20.680
SUICIDE FACTOR. OBVIOUSLY, THAT

01:50:20.747 --> 01:50:22.782
IS SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE

01:50:22.849 --> 01:50:24.050
ARRESTED IN SOME WAY, BUT I

01:50:24.117 --> 01:50:25.919
DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S EVIDENCE.

01:50:25.986 --> 01:50:27.687
I MEAN, ONE SUICIDE IS ONE TOO

01:50:27.754 --> 01:50:28.888
MANY, OBVIOUSLY, OF A YOUNG

01:50:28.955 --> 01:50:30.690
PERSON OR AN ELDERLY PERSON,

01:50:30.757 --> 01:50:33.994
WHOEVER. BUT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT

01:50:34.060 --> 01:50:35.562
THE DATA THAT REALLY SUPPORTS

01:50:35.628 --> 01:50:36.796
IT. I JUST THINK WE'RE EARLY

01:50:36.863 --> 01:50:38.999
DAYS ON THIS. I WOULD LIKE THE

01:50:39.065 --> 01:50:40.066
PARAMETERS, I LIKE THE

01:50:40.133 --> 01:50:41.935
REPORTING, I LIKE ALL OF THAT. I

01:50:42.002 --> 01:50:44.771
JUST DON'T KNOW. I GUESS THE

01:50:44.838 --> 01:50:46.239
LIABILITY FACTOR, THE PRIVATE

01:50:46.306 --> 01:50:47.640
RIGHT OF ACTION GIVES ME PAUSE.

01:50:47.707 --> 01:50:51.244
I HOPE WE CAN GET SOMEWHERE TO

01:50:51.311 --> 01:50:53.246
RESOLVE THAT IT IS A PROBLEM.

01:50:53.313 --> 01:50:54.547
AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE

01:50:54.614 --> 01:50:55.315
PLATFORM COMPANIES, THE

01:50:55.382 --> 01:50:56.816
TECHNICAL, THE TECHNOLOGY

01:50:56.883 --> 01:50:59.152
COMPANIES. IT'S GROWING. I DON'T

01:50:59.219 --> 01:51:01.688
THINK WE SHOULD SHUT DOWN

01:51:01.755 --> 01:51:03.823
CHATGPT AND ALL OF THOSE NEW

01:51:03.890 --> 01:51:06.493
TYPE OF AI TECHNOLOGIES, BUT WE

01:51:06.559 --> 01:51:08.828
HAVE TO HAVE SOME GUARDRAILS, AS

01:51:08.895 --> 01:51:10.230
YOU SAY. I DON'T THINK WE'RE

01:51:10.296 --> 01:51:11.765
THERE YET, BUT I APPRECIATE WHAT

01:51:11.831 --> 01:51:13.833
YOU'RE ALL TRYING TO DO. WE DO

01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:15.301
NEED A SOLUTION. I DON'T KNOW IF

01:51:15.368 --> 01:51:17.003
THIS IS THE PERFECT ONE YET. I

01:51:17.070 --> 01:51:18.838
DON'T LIKE THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF

01:51:18.905 --> 01:51:19.372
ACTION. THAT'S MY PRIMARY

01:51:19.439 --> 01:51:21.908
CONCERN. OKAY. THANK YOU. OKAY.

01:51:21.975 --> 01:51:23.777
ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAUER-KAHAN.

01:51:23.843 --> 01:51:25.478
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. AND THANK

01:51:25.545 --> 01:51:27.213
YOU TO THE SENATOR. AND I THINK

01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:31.284
YOU KNOW. THE VICE CHAIR, I

01:51:31.351 --> 01:51:33.286
THINK HITS HOME THE POINT, WHICH

01:51:33.353 --> 01:51:37.624
IS WE ALL HOPEFULLY CARE ABOUT

01:51:37.690 --> 01:51:39.092
CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN AND THEIR

01:51:39.159 --> 01:51:40.427
SAFETY AND THEIR WELL-BEING. AND

01:51:40.493 --> 01:51:43.196
I KNOW THE SENATOR HAS A

01:51:43.263 --> 01:51:44.197
GRANDCHILD THAT IS GOING TO BE

01:51:44.264 --> 01:51:45.999
RAISED IN THIS. OR ONE MORE TO

01:51:46.066 --> 01:51:47.267
COME. SO GRANDCHILDREN THAT ARE

01:51:47.333 --> 01:51:49.202
GOING TO BE RAISED IN THIS

01:51:49.269 --> 01:51:50.203
TECHNOLOGICAL AGE. AND AS

01:51:50.270 --> 01:51:52.405
PARENTS, WE KNOW THAT IT'S

01:51:52.472 --> 01:51:55.642
REALLY HARD. AND, YOU KNOW, THE

01:51:55.708 --> 01:51:57.177
RESEARCH THAT'S COMING OUT THAT

01:51:57.243 --> 01:51:57.911
SHOWS THAT CHILDREN ARE NOW

01:51:57.977 --> 01:51:59.746
MIGRATING FROM THE SOCIAL MEDIA

01:51:59.813 --> 01:52:01.414
PLATFORMS TO THESE CHAT BOTS,

01:52:01.481 --> 01:52:03.283
MAKES THEM THE NEXT FRONTIER.

01:52:03.349 --> 01:52:06.152
AND I THINK WHAT HAS BEEN

01:52:06.219 --> 01:52:08.021
FRUSTRATING TO ME IN MY SIX AND

01:52:08.088 --> 01:52:09.756
A HALF YEARS NOW, AND I THINK IS

01:52:09.823 --> 01:52:11.724
STARTING TO BE EXPRESSED BY THE

01:52:11.791 --> 01:52:13.393
VICE CHAIR AS WELL, IS THAT IF

01:52:13.460 --> 01:52:14.561
THE PLATFORMS CARE AS DEEPLY AS

01:52:14.627 --> 01:52:17.931
WE DO ABOUT OUR CHILDREN, THEN

01:52:17.997 --> 01:52:19.299
YOU'LL COME TO THE TABLE AND

01:52:19.365 --> 01:52:21.134
YOU'LL HELP US FIGURE OUT A WAY

01:52:21.201 --> 01:52:23.203
AND WHAT IS. AND I KNOW THAT

01:52:23.269 --> 01:52:24.871
YOU'RE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO HIT

01:52:24.938 --> 01:52:26.940
HOME WITH THE PLATFORMS HAVE

01:52:27.006 --> 01:52:27.740
DONE TO DATE, AND IT ISN'T

01:52:27.807 --> 01:52:30.577
ENOUGH. AND THAT'S WHY IN MY

01:52:30.643 --> 01:52:32.445
COMMITTEE AND YOU KNOW, WHAT THE

01:52:32.512 --> 01:52:33.546
SENATOR TALKED ABOUT IS WE HAVE

01:52:33.613 --> 01:52:35.115
A PARADE OF PARENTS COMING IN

01:52:35.181 --> 01:52:36.749
AND TELLING US ABOUT THE HARMS

01:52:36.816 --> 01:52:38.151
THESE PLATFORMS ARE CAUSING

01:52:38.218 --> 01:52:39.953
THEIR CHILDREN. AND SO, YOU

01:52:40.019 --> 01:52:42.021
KNOW, I HAVE BILLS IN THIS

01:52:42.088 --> 01:52:43.756
SPACE. OTHERS AROUND THIS DAIS

01:52:43.823 --> 01:52:45.125
HAVE BILLS IN THIS SPACE. THE

01:52:45.191 --> 01:52:46.359
SENATOR HAS DONE. I DON'T THINK

01:52:46.426 --> 01:52:47.861
THIS IS HIS ONLY BILL IN THE

01:52:47.927 --> 01:52:49.996
SPACE. BUT NO, I'M RIGHT ABOUT

01:52:50.063 --> 01:52:52.265
THAT. AND IN PART WE ARE TRYING

01:52:52.332 --> 01:52:53.733
EVERYTHING BECAUSE NOBODY IS

01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:55.935
OFFERING US SOLUTIONS TO THIS

01:52:56.002 --> 01:52:57.070
PROBLEM. AND SO THAT'S WHAT I

01:52:57.137 --> 01:52:59.172
THINK WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO.

01:52:59.239 --> 01:53:01.074
AND SO I URGE THE PLATFORMS AND

01:53:01.141 --> 01:53:02.075
THE NOW THE AI COMPANIES TO COME

01:53:02.142 --> 01:53:04.144
TO THE TABLE AND TO BE OUR

01:53:04.210 --> 01:53:04.777
PARTNERS IN PROTECTING

01:53:04.844 --> 01:53:06.613
CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN. AND THAT

01:53:06.679 --> 01:53:08.047
STILL GIVES YOU A LOT OF ROOM TO

01:53:08.114 --> 01:53:09.282
MONETIZE EVERYBODY OVER 18 AND

01:53:09.349 --> 01:53:11.684
TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY. BUT, YOU

01:53:11.751 --> 01:53:12.986
KNOW, FOR OUR KIDS, THERE SHOULD

01:53:13.052 --> 01:53:14.354
BE A DIFFERENT STANDARD. AND

01:53:14.420 --> 01:53:16.422
THERE SHOULD NEVER BE A CHILD

01:53:16.489 --> 01:53:17.724
PARENT SITTING AT THIS TABLE

01:53:17.790 --> 01:53:19.125
TELLING US THAT THEIR CHILD DIED

01:53:19.192 --> 01:53:21.761
BY SUICIDE BECAUSE OF

01:53:21.828 --> 01:53:23.062
TECHNOLOGY, AND WE HAVE TO END

01:53:23.129 --> 01:53:25.031
IT. AND ONE IS TOO MANY AND

01:53:25.098 --> 01:53:26.332
THERE'S BEEN WAY MORE THAN ONE.

01:53:26.399 --> 01:53:29.068
AND SO I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS

01:53:29.135 --> 01:53:29.969
AND EVERY OTHER BILL THAT IS

01:53:30.036 --> 01:53:31.738
TRYING TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S

01:53:31.804 --> 01:53:33.106
CHILDREN. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR

01:53:33.173 --> 01:53:34.908
COMMENTS? I WANT TO THANK YOU,

01:53:34.974 --> 01:53:36.843
SENATOR, FOR BRINGING THIS

01:53:36.910 --> 01:53:39.345
FORWARD. AND I THINK THERE'S A

01:53:39.412 --> 01:53:41.214
TREND RELATIVELY RECENTLY IN

01:53:41.281 --> 01:53:44.284
THIS BUILDING OF LEGISLATION IN

01:53:44.350 --> 01:53:45.752
THE TECH SPACE REGARDING

01:53:45.818 --> 01:53:46.819
PROTECTING CHILDREN. AND THAT'S

01:53:46.886 --> 01:53:48.821
A GOOD TREND. AND IT DOESN'T

01:53:48.888 --> 01:53:50.089
MEAN THAT EVERY BILL IS GOING TO

01:53:50.156 --> 01:53:51.991
DO IT PERFECTLY, WHAT HAVE YOU.

01:53:52.058 --> 01:53:54.394
BUT THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALL HERE TO

01:53:54.460 --> 01:53:55.728
CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT. BUT I

01:53:55.795 --> 01:53:56.996
DO AGREE THAT THE TECH COMPANIES

01:53:57.063 --> 01:53:58.965
CAN DO A LOT MORE. I MEAN, THE

01:53:59.032 --> 01:54:00.066
FIRST COMPANY TO REACH $1

01:54:00.133 --> 01:54:01.167
TRILLION MARKET CAP WAS APPLE

01:54:01.234 --> 01:54:03.736
SEVEN YEARS AGO. WE NOW HAVE A

01:54:03.803 --> 01:54:04.904
DOZEN, NINE OF WHICH ARE TECH

01:54:04.971 --> 01:54:06.673
COMPANIES, ALL OF WHICH ARE

01:54:06.739 --> 01:54:07.307
EXPANDING THEIR MARKET CAP AND

01:54:07.373 --> 01:54:08.441
PROFITING PROFITING WILDLY

01:54:08.508 --> 01:54:10.043
BECAUSE OF THE USE OF AI. AND

01:54:10.109 --> 01:54:11.878
SO, AGAIN, I'LL SAY IT AGAIN,

01:54:11.945 --> 01:54:13.112
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS. YOU

01:54:13.179 --> 01:54:17.250
CAN'T USE THESE TECHNOLOGIES TO

01:54:17.317 --> 01:54:19.052
ENTRAP YOUNG PEOPLE INTO THIS

01:54:19.118 --> 01:54:20.320
ADDICTION AND USAGE, AND

01:54:20.386 --> 01:54:22.222
ULTIMATELY TO WILD PROFIT AT THE

01:54:22.288 --> 01:54:23.389
SAME TIME. AND KNOWING WHAT

01:54:23.456 --> 01:54:24.824
THOSE THAT TECHNOLOGY CAN DO TO

01:54:24.891 --> 01:54:27.060
DO THAT AND THEN SAY AT THE SAME

01:54:27.126 --> 01:54:28.127
TIME, BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE

01:54:28.194 --> 01:54:30.897
TOOLS TO DO THIS OTHER THING TO

01:54:30.964 --> 01:54:32.198
PROTECT THEM. IT'S NOT AN EITHER

01:54:32.265 --> 01:54:33.399
OR SCENARIO. I AM APPRECIATIVE

01:54:33.466 --> 01:54:34.467
THAT THERE'S CONVERSATIONS GOING

01:54:34.534 --> 01:54:36.536
ON IN TERMS OF LANGUAGE AND KIND

01:54:36.603 --> 01:54:38.404
OF THINGS THAT MIGHT WORK FOR

01:54:38.471 --> 01:54:39.172
SOME OF THE COMPANIES. WE DON'T

01:54:39.239 --> 01:54:40.173
WANT TO STIFLE INNOVATION. WE

01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:42.542
NEVER WANT TO DO THAT. AND I

01:54:42.609 --> 01:54:44.644
THINK GIVEN THE MARKET VALUATION

01:54:44.711 --> 01:54:46.045
OF THESE COMPANIES, I DON'T

01:54:46.112 --> 01:54:47.714
THINK THAT SOMEONE CAN MAKE THE

01:54:47.780 --> 01:54:48.581
ARGUMENT THAT WE ARE STIFLING

01:54:48.648 --> 01:54:49.882
INNOVATION. BUT THAT'S NOT OUR

01:54:49.949 --> 01:54:52.118
JOB. OUR JOB HERE IS NOT TO BE

01:54:52.185 --> 01:54:53.219
CONCERNED WITH THE COMPANIES

01:54:53.286 --> 01:54:54.220
WHETHER THEY'RE DOING WELL OR

01:54:54.287 --> 01:54:56.823
NOT. IT WHEN IT COMES TO THE

01:54:56.889 --> 01:54:58.191
SAFETY OF OUR CHILDREN, I THINK

01:54:58.258 --> 01:55:00.860
WE CAN DO ALL OF IT. WE CAN

01:55:00.927 --> 01:55:01.894
ENCOURAGE THESE COMPANIES AND

01:55:01.961 --> 01:55:03.296
ENCOURAGE INNOVATION AND PROTECT

01:55:03.363 --> 01:55:05.031
OUR CHILDREN AT THE SAME TIME.

01:55:05.098 --> 01:55:07.000
IN FACT, THAT I THINK, IS OUR

01:55:07.066 --> 01:55:08.034
DUTY. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE?

01:55:08.101 --> 01:55:09.836
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR.

01:55:09.902 --> 01:55:10.937
CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE

01:55:11.004 --> 01:55:11.871
COMMITTEE. AND THANK YOU, MR.

01:55:11.938 --> 01:55:13.539
CHAIRMAN, FOR YOUR COMMENTS. I

01:55:13.606 --> 01:55:14.841
WOULD JUST CLOSE WITH A COUPLE

01:55:14.907 --> 01:55:16.042
COMMENTS AND THAT TO YOUR POINT,

01:55:16.109 --> 01:55:18.044
THE DATA IS FAIRLY OVERWHELMING

01:55:18.111 --> 01:55:18.811
THAT THESE INNOVATIVE VENTURES

01:55:18.878 --> 01:55:21.247
ARE NOT BEING STIFLED. THEY'RE

01:55:21.314 --> 01:55:22.515
EXPERIENCING EXPONENTIAL GROWTH,

01:55:22.582 --> 01:55:23.983
AND THEY'RE EXPERIENCING THAT

01:55:24.050 --> 01:55:26.319
GROWTH WITH A NEW DEPLOYED

01:55:26.386 --> 01:55:27.687
TECHNOLOGY THAT IS GLOBAL,

01:55:27.754 --> 01:55:28.821
INTEGRATED AND SOPHISTICATED ON

01:55:28.888 --> 01:55:30.056
A LEVEL WE HAVE NOT SEEN IN

01:55:30.123 --> 01:55:32.091
HUMAN HISTORY. I WOULD ARGUE

01:55:32.158 --> 01:55:33.159
PROBABLY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

01:55:33.226 --> 01:55:34.527
ADVANCE IN THE APPLICATION OF

01:55:34.594 --> 01:55:35.895
TECHNOLOGY SINCE THE ADVENT OF

01:55:35.962 --> 01:55:37.764
THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION IN THE

01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:41.034
CASE RECENTLY. SO I WOULD SAY

01:55:41.100 --> 01:55:42.435
FIRST, AS TO THAT POINT, I WOULD

01:55:42.502 --> 01:55:44.270
JUST WANT TO ECHO THAT. I THINK

01:55:44.337 --> 01:55:46.639
THE DATA SET IS GROWING AND IT

01:55:46.706 --> 01:55:48.508
IS MULTIFACETED, THAT THERE ARE

01:55:48.574 --> 01:55:49.942
MANY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES TO

01:55:50.009 --> 01:55:51.010
THE DEPLOYMENT OF THIS

01:55:51.077 --> 01:55:52.478
TECHNOLOGY AND THE ABSENCE OF

01:55:52.545 --> 01:55:54.847
ANY SERIOUS REGULATORY SCHEME

01:55:54.914 --> 01:55:56.382
THAT IS NOT JUST AFFECTING

01:55:56.449 --> 01:55:58.284
CHILDREN, WHICH I THINK ARE THE

01:55:58.351 --> 01:55:59.719
CLOSEST TO PROBABLY MOST OF OUR

01:55:59.786 --> 01:56:01.154
HEARTS, BUT ALSO ANY VULNERABLE

01:56:01.220 --> 01:56:04.023
INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE IN IN

01:56:04.090 --> 01:56:05.191
EXPERIENCING MENTAL DIFFICULTIES

01:56:05.258 --> 01:56:08.294
AND DISTRESS ARE PARTICULARLY

01:56:08.361 --> 01:56:09.362
VULNERABLE. AND LET'S NOT FORGET

01:56:09.429 --> 01:56:12.598
THAT THE DESIGN OF THESE

01:56:12.665 --> 01:56:13.933
ALGORITHMS TO MIMIC

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.269
ANTHROPOMORPHIC FEATURES AND TO

01:56:16.336 --> 01:56:18.738
REWARD AND NOT REWARD, CREATES A

01:56:18.805 --> 01:56:20.106
PATTERN OF ENGAGEMENT THAT

01:56:20.173 --> 01:56:21.974
MIMICS KIND OF AN ADDICTIVE

01:56:22.041 --> 01:56:23.609
PATTERN, AND THAT IS BY DESIGN,

01:56:23.676 --> 01:56:25.244
NO PUN INTENDED. IT IS

01:56:25.311 --> 01:56:26.579
INTENTIONAL BECAUSE THAT'S THE

01:56:26.646 --> 01:56:28.314
ECONOMIC DRIVER, THAT'S THE

01:56:28.381 --> 01:56:30.216
ENGINE THAT DRAWS PEOPLE IN TO

01:56:30.283 --> 01:56:31.651
DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES TO BE

01:56:31.718 --> 01:56:33.486
EXPOSED TO MARKETING AND OTHER

01:56:33.553 --> 01:56:36.022
PROFIT MAKING INTERACTIONS. SO

01:56:36.089 --> 01:56:38.091
THE DESIGN IS INTENTIONAL. IT'S

01:56:38.157 --> 01:56:40.226
WORKING. IT'S VERY WELL

01:56:40.293 --> 01:56:43.529
MONETIZED, BUT IT HAS A SET OF

01:56:43.596 --> 01:56:45.298
UNINTENDED, VERY DEVASTATING

01:56:45.365 --> 01:56:46.432
CONSEQUENCES FOR PEOPLE IN

01:56:46.499 --> 01:56:47.934
DISTRESS AND FOR CHILDREN WHO

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.403
CAN'T DISCERN. AND THIS BILL IS

01:56:50.470 --> 01:56:52.438
NOT SHUTTING ANYTHING DOWN. THIS

01:56:52.505 --> 01:56:54.941
BILL IS NOT DESIGNED TO STIFLE

01:56:55.007 --> 01:56:56.843
ANYONE'S INNOVATION OR GROWTH ON

01:56:56.909 --> 01:56:59.078
THE POSITIVE ELEMENTS OF THIS

01:56:59.145 --> 01:57:00.012
TECHNOLOGY. IT IS DESIGNED TO

01:57:00.079 --> 01:57:02.515
TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY NOW TO PUT

01:57:02.582 --> 01:57:05.518
IN PLACE REASONABLE SAFEGUARDS

01:57:05.585 --> 01:57:07.587
THAT PROTECT THOSE WHO ARE MOST

01:57:07.653 --> 01:57:09.822
VULNERABLE. AND I WOULD ARGUE

01:57:09.889 --> 01:57:12.225
THAT THOSE REQUIREMENTS ON

01:57:12.291 --> 01:57:13.326
REPORTING AND DISCLOSURE AND

01:57:13.393 --> 01:57:14.560
NOTIFICATION TO THE USER ARE

01:57:14.627 --> 01:57:16.362
BEYOND REASONABLE. I WOULD ARGUE

01:57:16.429 --> 01:57:19.165
THAT THEY ARE NOT FINANCIALLY

01:57:19.232 --> 01:57:20.933
OVERLY BURDENSOME. I WOULD ALSO

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:22.335
JUST WANT TO NOTE, FOR THE

01:57:22.402 --> 01:57:23.870
RECORD TO YOUR ANALYSIS, WE ARE

01:57:23.936 --> 01:57:25.405
WILLING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON

01:57:25.471 --> 01:57:26.739
ADDRESSING THE FIRST AMENDMENT

01:57:26.806 --> 01:57:28.207
CONCERNS AND ISSUES HERE. WE'VE

01:57:28.274 --> 01:57:29.308
TRIED TO TAILOR THAT LANGUAGE

01:57:29.375 --> 01:57:31.377
VERY NARROWLY, AND I DO. I WOULD

01:57:31.444 --> 01:57:32.845
ALSO ARGUE WITH RESPECT TO THE

01:57:32.912 --> 01:57:35.047
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. WE ARE

01:57:35.114 --> 01:57:36.916
DISCREET ABOUT THAT IN THIS

01:57:36.983 --> 01:57:37.550
STATE FOR GOOD REASON, BECAUSE

01:57:37.617 --> 01:57:38.384
WE'VE ALL EXPERIENCED THE

01:57:38.451 --> 01:57:40.353
DOWNSIDE OF COURT SYSTEMS THAT

01:57:40.420 --> 01:57:42.188
ARE ON THE VERGE OF COLLAPSE FOR

01:57:42.255 --> 01:57:43.456
A LOT OF FRIVOLOUS ACTIONS. THIS

01:57:43.523 --> 01:57:45.825
IS NOT FRIVOLOUS. THERE NEEDS TO

01:57:45.892 --> 01:57:47.593
BE A REMEDY HERE THAT IS

01:57:47.660 --> 01:57:49.796
SPECIFIC TO THIS HARM, AND WE

01:57:49.862 --> 01:57:51.731
TRIED TO KEEP IT NARROWLY

01:57:51.798 --> 01:57:53.032
TAILORED, AND WE WILL CONTINUE

01:57:53.099 --> 01:57:55.001
TO WORK ON MAKING SURE THAT WE

01:57:55.067 --> 01:57:57.036
ARE FASHIONING LANGUAGE THAT CAN

01:57:57.103 --> 01:57:58.638
WITHSTAND SCRUTINY HERE. SO WITH

01:57:58.704 --> 01:58:00.606
ALL OF THAT SAID, I WOULD JUST

01:58:00.673 --> 01:58:02.074
ADD THAT WITH THE ADVENT OF

01:58:02.141 --> 01:58:04.477
SOCIAL MEDIA, WE MISSED A

01:58:04.544 --> 01:58:07.547
WINDOW. THERE IS SUCH A THING AS

01:58:07.613 --> 01:58:09.849
BEING TOO LATE AND WE HAVE AN

01:58:09.916 --> 01:58:11.284
OPPORTUNITY NOW WITH THE

01:58:11.350 --> 01:58:12.919
EXPLOSION IN THIS TECHNOLOGY TO

01:58:12.985 --> 01:58:14.954
TAKE ACTION. AND I WOULD

01:58:15.021 --> 01:58:16.589
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE

01:58:16.656 --> 01:58:17.890
VOTE. THANK YOU. AND WE'LL TAKE

01:58:17.957 --> 01:58:20.593
THAT UP WHEN WE GET A QUORUM.

01:58:20.660 --> 01:58:22.862
THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION.

01:58:22.929 --> 01:58:26.232
UP NEXT, SENATOR WAHAB IS HERE,

01:58:26.299 --> 01:58:27.733
AND I BELIEVE SENATOR WAHAB HAS

01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:30.736
FOUR BILLS. SO WE'LL JUST SETTLE

01:58:30.803 --> 01:58:42.715
IN AND GET COMFORTABLE. TODAY.

01:58:42.782 --> 01:58:47.286
OH MY GOD. WHERE ARE WE WITH

01:58:47.353 --> 01:58:49.755
NUMBER TWO, FIVE, NINE. ALL

01:58:49.822 --> 01:58:50.890
RIGHT. WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO IN

01:58:50.957 --> 01:59:02.602
ORDER? ONE SECOND. MR. JUST

01:59:02.668 --> 01:59:04.303
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE LA CITY

01:59:04.370 --> 01:59:06.038
ATTORNEY AND ANOTHER WITNESS AND

01:59:06.105 --> 01:59:07.540
SHE HAS TO TESTIFY IN ANOTHER,

01:59:07.607 --> 01:59:09.408
WE'D LIKE TO START WITH THAT

01:59:09.475 --> 01:59:12.245
ONE, WHICH IS. SB 522. OKAY. SO

01:59:12.311 --> 01:59:28.694
WE'LL START WITH ITEM 12 SB 522.

01:59:28.761 --> 01:59:30.463
KNOW GREAT MINDS RIGHT? WE LIKE

01:59:30.530 --> 01:59:31.998
TO SAY THAT ON PURPOSE, BUT

01:59:32.064 --> 01:59:34.567
THANK YOU FOR ASKING. ALL RIGHT.

01:59:34.634 --> 01:59:36.202
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. ALL

01:59:36.269 --> 01:59:37.503
RIGHT. CHAIR, COLLEAGUES AND

01:59:37.570 --> 01:59:40.239
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC, SB 522

01:59:40.306 --> 01:59:42.341
SIMPLY EXTENDS THE JUST CAUSE

01:59:42.408 --> 01:59:43.609
FOR EVICTION PROTECTIONS TO

01:59:43.676 --> 01:59:44.610
UNITS PREVIOUSLY COVERED BY THE

01:59:44.677 --> 01:59:46.445
TENANT PROTECTION ACT, THE JUST

01:59:46.512 --> 01:59:48.080
CAUSE FOR EVICTIONS PROVISIONS

01:59:48.147 --> 01:59:49.315
OF THE TENANT PROTECTION ACT ARE

01:59:49.382 --> 01:59:51.083
BASED ON THE CERTIFICATE OF

01:59:51.150 --> 01:59:52.184
OCCUPANCY DATE FOR THE UNIT.

01:59:52.251 --> 01:59:53.886
THIS BECOMES PROBLEMATIC WHEN

01:59:53.953 --> 01:59:55.454
UNITS COVERED BY THESE

01:59:55.521 --> 01:59:56.689
PROVISIONS ARE DESTROYED IN A

01:59:56.756 --> 01:59:58.190
DISASTER. WHEN REBUILT, THESE

01:59:58.257 --> 01:59:59.492
UNITS WOULD HAVE A CERTIFICATE

01:59:59.559 --> 02:00:01.527
OF OCCUPANCY DATES THAT EXCLUDE

02:00:01.594 --> 02:00:03.195
THEM FROM THE PROVISIONS OF THE

02:00:03.262 --> 02:00:05.565
TPA. JUST CAUSE FOR EVICTION

02:00:05.631 --> 02:00:06.899
PROTECTIONS ARE ONE OF THE MOST

02:00:06.966 --> 02:00:08.134
BASIC WAYS WE KEEP PEOPLE

02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:09.402
HOUSED. THIS POLICY ENSURES

02:00:09.468 --> 02:00:10.436
EVICTIONS ARE NOT ARBITRARY,

02:00:10.503 --> 02:00:11.938
RETALIATORY, OR DISCRIMINATORY

02:00:12.004 --> 02:00:14.373
IN NATURE, AND THAT TENANTS ARE

02:00:14.440 --> 02:00:16.509
ABLE TO ADVOCATE FOR THEMSELVES,

02:00:16.576 --> 02:00:18.644
ESPECIALLY AROUND DIFFERENT

02:00:18.711 --> 02:00:20.246
TYPES OF ISSUES, BY PROTECTING

02:00:20.313 --> 02:00:22.014
UNITS PREVIOUSLY COVERED UNDER

02:00:22.081 --> 02:00:24.550
TPA, WE HELP STABILIZE

02:00:24.617 --> 02:00:26.519
COMMUNITIES, REBUILD AFTER

02:00:26.586 --> 02:00:27.486
DEVASTATING DISASTERS, AND

02:00:27.553 --> 02:00:29.088
CREATE LONG TERM STABILITY FOR

02:00:29.155 --> 02:00:30.256
RENTERS. CONTRARY TO THE

02:00:30.323 --> 02:00:31.624
OPPOSITION LETTER, THIS BILL IN

02:00:31.691 --> 02:00:33.826
NO WAY ADDS ANY TYPE OF RENT

02:00:33.893 --> 02:00:35.962
CONTROL OR IMPEDES CONSTRUCTION.

02:00:36.028 --> 02:00:37.129
ADDITIONALLY, THE HOUSING CRISIS

02:00:37.196 --> 02:00:39.298
ACT ONLY APPLIES TO LOCAL RENT

02:00:39.365 --> 02:00:40.099
STABILIZATION PROVISIONS, NOT

02:00:40.166 --> 02:00:43.903
THE TPA, WHICH IS WHY SB 522 IS

02:00:43.970 --> 02:00:45.404
NECESSARY UNDER THE TENANT

02:00:45.471 --> 02:00:47.506
PROTECTION ACT. THERE ARE 15

02:00:47.573 --> 02:00:48.975
REASONS A LANDLORD MAY EVICT A

02:00:49.041 --> 02:00:50.776
TENANT, INCLUDING NONPAYMENT OF

02:00:50.843 --> 02:00:52.712
RENT, BREACH OF LEASE TERMS,

02:00:52.778 --> 02:00:54.480
NUISANCE WASTE OR USING THE UNIT

02:00:54.547 --> 02:00:55.448
FOR UNLAWFUL PURPOSES, OWNER

02:00:55.514 --> 02:00:58.284
MOVE IN AND MANY OTHER ITEMS. SB

02:00:58.351 --> 02:01:01.754
522 IS ONLY ABOUT THE TPA'S JUST

02:01:01.821 --> 02:01:04.357
CAUSE FOR EVICTIONS PROVISION.

02:01:04.423 --> 02:01:07.360
IN THE EVENT OF A DISASTER. I'D

02:01:07.426 --> 02:01:10.529
LIKE TO INTRODUCE MY WITNESS, LA

02:01:10.596 --> 02:01:13.165
CITY ATTORNEY HEIDI FELDSTEIN.

02:01:13.232 --> 02:01:16.335
SOTO AND ANDREAS. SORRY RAMOS,

02:01:16.402 --> 02:01:19.171
PUBLIC ADVOCATES. THANK YOU,

02:01:19.238 --> 02:01:21.240
THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING, MISTER

02:01:21.307 --> 02:01:22.441
CHAIR, AND MEMBERS OF THE

02:01:22.508 --> 02:01:23.676
COMMITTEE. APPRECIATE YOUR TIME

02:01:23.743 --> 02:01:26.345
VERY MUCH. I'M UP HERE FOR LOS

02:01:26.412 --> 02:01:29.515
ANGELES BECAUSE OF THE WILDFIRES

02:01:29.582 --> 02:01:32.184
THAT ENGULFED OUR CITY JUST SIX

02:01:32.251 --> 02:01:33.185
MONTHS AND TWO DAYS AGO, BUT

02:01:33.252 --> 02:01:36.522
WHO'S COUNTING? ON JANUARY 7TH,

02:01:36.589 --> 02:01:38.224
2025, I WAS ACTUALLY IN

02:01:38.290 --> 02:01:41.260
SACRAMENTO WITH NINE BILL IDEAS.

02:01:41.327 --> 02:01:43.129
AND USUALLY WHEN I COME UP TO

02:01:43.195 --> 02:01:44.530
SACRAMENTO, I GO HOME WITH

02:01:44.597 --> 02:01:47.333
FEWER. I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:49.101
TALK TO LEGISLATORS. MANY OF MY

02:01:49.168 --> 02:01:51.370
OWN LEGISLATORS HAD HEADED BACK

02:01:51.437 --> 02:01:54.140
TO LA, BUT TO TALK TO OTHERS

02:01:54.206 --> 02:01:56.409
HERE ABOUT WHAT WE COULD DO TO

02:01:56.475 --> 02:01:57.343
HELP THE WILDFIRES. AND THIS IS

02:01:57.410 --> 02:01:58.978
ONE OF THE IDEAS THAT CAME OUT

02:01:59.045 --> 02:02:00.946
OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS. LOS

02:02:01.013 --> 02:02:04.150
ANGELES, A CITY THAT IS 70%

02:02:04.216 --> 02:02:07.353
RENTERS, THAT IS OUR POPULATION

02:02:07.420 --> 02:02:09.255
THAT IS VERY MUCH THE FOLKS WHO

02:02:09.321 --> 02:02:11.457
LIVE IN OUR CITY DAY IN AND DAY

02:02:11.524 --> 02:02:14.193
OUT. WE HAVE A RENT

02:02:14.260 --> 02:02:15.761
STABILIZATION ORDINANCE. IT DOES

02:02:15.828 --> 02:02:18.497
NOT HAVE A VACANCY CONTROL

02:02:18.564 --> 02:02:20.433
FEATURE. UNLIKE NEW YORK. IT IS

02:02:20.499 --> 02:02:23.002
VERY MUCH RENT STABILIZATION FOR

02:02:23.069 --> 02:02:24.737
THE TENANTS THAT ARE THERE. AND

02:02:24.804 --> 02:02:26.539
WE TRY TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS

02:02:26.605 --> 02:02:27.973
RENTAL HOUSING AND AFFORDABLE

02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:30.509
HOUSING THROUGHOUT OUR CITY. AS

02:02:30.576 --> 02:02:31.911
YOU MAY KNOW, THE TPA, THE

02:02:31.977 --> 02:02:34.480
TENANT PROTECTION ACT OF 2019,

02:02:34.547 --> 02:02:36.782
PROHIBITS UNTIL JANUARY 1ST,

02:02:36.849 --> 02:02:38.484
2030, AN OWNER OF RESIDENTIAL

02:02:38.551 --> 02:02:39.919
REAL PROPERTY FROM TERMINATING

02:02:39.985 --> 02:02:41.287
THE TENANCY OF CERTAIN TENANTS

02:02:41.353 --> 02:02:43.656
WITHOUT JUST CAUSE, EITHER AT

02:02:43.723 --> 02:02:45.157
FAULT OR NO FAULT OF THE TENANT.

02:02:45.224 --> 02:02:46.992
IT EXEMPTS CERTAIN RESIDENTIAL

02:02:47.059 --> 02:02:48.828
REAL PROPERTY FROM ITS

02:02:48.894 --> 02:02:50.029
PARAMETERS, AND THE REAL

02:02:50.096 --> 02:02:51.030
PROPERTY THAT IT EXEMPTS

02:02:51.097 --> 02:02:52.798
INCLUDES REAL PROPERTY WITH A

02:02:52.865 --> 02:02:55.201
CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY ON A

02:02:55.267 --> 02:02:57.737
DATE THAT OCCURS WITHIN THE

02:02:57.803 --> 02:03:01.140
IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING 15 YEARS,

02:03:01.207 --> 02:03:03.709
WHEN A DISASTER, SUCH AS THE

02:03:03.776 --> 02:03:06.278
PALISADES FIRE HITS AN ENTIRE

02:03:06.345 --> 02:03:07.646
COMMUNITY, IT IS AS DEVASTATING

02:03:07.713 --> 02:03:10.750
TO THE RENTAL RESIDENTS OF THAT

02:03:10.816 --> 02:03:11.851
COMMUNITY AS IT IS TO THE

02:03:11.917 --> 02:03:17.857
HOMEOWNERS. SO MUCH OF OUR. I'M

02:03:17.923 --> 02:03:20.392
SORRY, AM I TOO CLOSE TO THE

02:03:20.459 --> 02:03:26.265
MIC? NO, THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE.

02:03:26.332 --> 02:03:28.134
ALL WE ARE DOING HERE IS WE ARE

02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:29.902
SAYING THAT WHEN DISASTER HITS,

02:03:29.969 --> 02:03:32.004
THE TENANTS IN THE AREA LIVING

02:03:32.071 --> 02:03:34.006
IN DECLARED DISASTER ZONES ARE

02:03:34.073 --> 02:03:35.708
ENTITLED TO COME BACK OR TO HAVE

02:03:35.775 --> 02:03:37.309
THE KIND OF RENT STABILIZED

02:03:37.376 --> 02:03:39.578
HOUSING IN THE COMMUNITY THAT

02:03:39.645 --> 02:03:41.514
PREEXISTED IT. THE CITY OF LOS

02:03:41.580 --> 02:03:43.549
ANGELES LOST 60 RENT STABILIZED

02:03:43.616 --> 02:03:46.452
BUILDINGS, 770 RENTAL UNITS IN

02:03:46.519 --> 02:03:48.988
THE PALISADES FIRE. 22 OTHERS

02:03:49.054 --> 02:03:51.123
WERE DAMAGED, AND THREE MOBILE

02:03:51.190 --> 02:03:52.625
HOME PARKS WERE DEVASTATED BY

02:03:52.691 --> 02:03:55.127
THESE FIRES. ROBUST RENTER

02:03:55.194 --> 02:03:56.729
PROTECTIONS ARE NEEDED FOR

02:03:56.796 --> 02:03:58.631
TENANTS OF NEW UNITS ONCE THEY

02:03:58.697 --> 02:04:01.567
ARE COMPLETED. SB 522 IS A

02:04:01.634 --> 02:04:02.535
NARROW BILL AT THIS POINT. IT

02:04:02.601 --> 02:04:05.571
SIMPLY APPLIES THE TPA

02:04:05.638 --> 02:04:06.939
LIMITATIONS TO ANNUAL RENT

02:04:07.006 --> 02:04:08.774
INCREASES TO THOSE ALREADY

02:04:08.841 --> 02:04:10.743
HEAVILY BURDENED LÀ RENTERS.

02:04:10.810 --> 02:04:12.578
IT'S KEY TO KEEPING RENTERS

02:04:12.645 --> 02:04:14.480
HOUSED IN THE PALISADES,

02:04:14.547 --> 02:04:15.915
REDUCING THE RISK OF

02:04:15.981 --> 02:04:17.116
HOMELESSNESS AND ENSURING THAT

02:04:17.183 --> 02:04:19.585
WE HAVE RENTAL UNITS THROUGHOUT

02:04:19.652 --> 02:04:21.387
OUR CITY. WE ANTICIPATE THAT

02:04:21.453 --> 02:04:23.122
MANY OF THE DESTROYED RENT

02:04:23.189 --> 02:04:24.490
CONTROL BUILDINGS WILL BE

02:04:24.557 --> 02:04:25.558
REPLACED WITH NEW CONSTRUCTION.

02:04:25.624 --> 02:04:27.493
WE HAVE STREAMLINED APPROVAL

02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:29.328
PROCEDURES AND INSURANCE

02:04:29.395 --> 02:04:31.931
PROCEEDS UTILIZATION IN PLACE,

02:04:31.997 --> 02:04:34.366
AND SO NOW IS THE TIME TO TAKE

02:04:34.433 --> 02:04:35.267
CORRECTIVE ACTION AND PROTECT

02:04:35.334 --> 02:04:37.870
OUR RENTAL HOUSING. PLEASE PASS

02:04:37.937 --> 02:04:42.541
SB 522. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING

02:04:42.608 --> 02:04:44.410
CHAIR MEMBERS. I'M ANDRES RAMOS,

02:04:44.476 --> 02:04:45.744
LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL WITH PUBLIC

02:04:45.811 --> 02:04:47.279
ADVOCATES. WE'RE A NONPROFIT LAW

02:04:47.346 --> 02:04:49.014
FIRM AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION

02:04:49.081 --> 02:04:50.349
THAT CHALLENGES THE SYSTEMIC

02:04:50.416 --> 02:04:52.184
CAUSES OF POVERTY AND RACIAL

02:04:52.251 --> 02:04:53.352
DISCRIMINATION BY STRENGTHENING

02:04:53.419 --> 02:04:54.720
COMMUNITY VOICES AND PUBLIC

02:04:54.787 --> 02:04:55.855

OF HOUSING, JUSTICE AND RENTERS

02:04:57.356 --> 02:04:59.625
RIGHTS. WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT

02:04:59.692 --> 02:05:01.594
OF SB 522, WHICH WILL EXTEND

02:05:01.660 --> 02:05:02.695
JUST CAUSE FOR EVICTION

02:05:02.761 --> 02:05:04.063
PROTECTIONS TO UNITS THAT WERE

02:05:04.129 --> 02:05:05.264
SUBSTANTIALLY DAMAGED OR

02:05:05.331 --> 02:05:07.333
DESTROYED BY DISASTER, AND WERE

02:05:07.399 --> 02:05:08.801
PREVIOUSLY COVERED BY THE TENANT

02:05:08.868 --> 02:05:10.336
PROTECTION ACT. TO ENSURE

02:05:10.402 --> 02:05:11.737
CONTINUED HOUSING STABILITY FOR

02:05:11.804 --> 02:05:13.839
RENTERS. THIS CHANGE IN LAW IS

02:05:13.906 --> 02:05:15.975
NEEDED IN THE WAKE OF NATURAL

02:05:16.041 --> 02:05:16.475
DISASTERS THAT OUR STATE

02:05:16.542 --> 02:05:18.544
CONTINUES TO FACE EVERY YEAR,

02:05:18.611 --> 02:05:20.012
THAT OFTEN RESULT IN THE

02:05:20.079 --> 02:05:21.413
DESTRUCTION OF HOUSING AND

02:05:21.480 --> 02:05:22.815
DISPLACEMENT OF TENANTS. OUR

02:05:22.882 --> 02:05:24.783
STATE IS ALREADY FACING A DIRE

02:05:24.850 --> 02:05:26.051
SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING,

02:05:26.118 --> 02:05:27.519
AND THESE DISASTERS ARE ONLY

02:05:27.586 --> 02:05:29.388
MAKING THAT PROBLEM WORSE,

02:05:29.455 --> 02:05:30.489
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE REPLACEMENT

02:05:30.556 --> 02:05:32.258
UNITS ARE UNAFFORDABLE OR LACK

02:05:32.324 --> 02:05:33.792
PROTECTIONS THAT THE PRIOR UNITS

02:05:33.859 --> 02:05:35.895
HAD. IN LOS ANGELES. THE YEAR

02:05:35.961 --> 02:05:37.563
THE EATON AND PALISADES FIRES

02:05:37.630 --> 02:05:39.398

02:05:39.465 --> 02:05:41.967
UNITS, INCLUDING 373 MOBILE

BUNGALOW COURTS, AND OVER 770

02:05:46.338 --> 02:05:48.073
RENT STABILIZED UNITS. CLIMATE

02:05:48.140 --> 02:05:49.208
DISASTERS WILL CONTINUE TO

02:05:49.275 --> 02:05:50.809
OCCUR, AND OUR LAWS MUST ADDRESS

02:05:50.876 --> 02:05:52.745
THIS DISCREPANCY TO ENSURE

02:05:52.811 --> 02:05:54.179
PROTECTIONS FOR TENANTS ARE NOT

02:05:54.246 --> 02:05:56.015
LOST WHEN DESTROYED. UNITS ARE

02:05:56.081 --> 02:05:57.783
REBUILT FOR RENTAL UNITS THAT

02:05:57.850 --> 02:05:59.118
BENEFIT FROM STATE PROTECTIONS

02:05:59.184 --> 02:06:02.121
FOR THE TENANT. BASED ON THE

02:06:02.187 --> 02:06:03.656
CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY DATE OF

02:06:03.722 --> 02:06:05.391
THE UNIT. CURRENT LAW DOES NOT

02:06:05.457 --> 02:06:06.492
CONTINUE THE PRIOR UNITS

02:06:06.558 --> 02:06:07.893
EVICTION PROTECTIONS, WHICH ARE

02:06:07.960 --> 02:06:08.961
CRITICAL TO ENSURING THAT

02:06:09.028 --> 02:06:10.930
TENANTS CAN STAY STABLY HOUSED.

02:06:10.996 --> 02:06:12.231
THE LOSS OF HOUSING UNITS THAT

02:06:12.298 --> 02:06:14.033
HAVE BEEN PROTECTED ON THE BASIS

02:06:14.099 --> 02:06:15.234
OF THEIR CERTIFICATE OF

02:06:15.301 --> 02:06:17.303
OCCUPANCY DATE WILL ONLY

02:06:17.369 --> 02:06:18.170
EXACERBATE OUR EXISTING HOUSING

02:06:18.237 --> 02:06:21.173
AND HOMELESSNESS CRISES. SB 522

02:06:21.240 --> 02:06:23.509
ONLY PRESERVES THE JUST CAUSE

02:06:23.575 --> 02:06:24.209
FOR EVICTION PROTECTIONS IN

02:06:24.276 --> 02:06:25.945
THESE RESTORED UNITS, NOT THE

02:06:26.011 --> 02:06:27.579
RENT CAP PROVIDING TENANTS WHO

02:06:27.646 --> 02:06:29.281
WERE DISPLACED DUE TO DISASTER.

02:06:29.348 --> 02:06:30.683
THE PEACE OF MIND THAT THEY

02:06:30.749 --> 02:06:32.418
WON'T LOSE THEIR HOME YET AGAIN

02:06:32.484 --> 02:06:34.486
DUE TO NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN.

02:06:34.553 --> 02:06:36.088
THIS BILL SIMPLY ENSURES ANY

02:06:36.155 --> 02:06:37.156
UNITS DESTROYED IN A DISASTER

02:06:37.222 --> 02:06:38.958

02:07:47.693 --> 02:07:49.461
NEWLY CONSTRUCTED RENTAL HOUSING

02:07:49.528 --> 02:07:51.563
IS GRANTED A 15 YEAR EXEMPTION

02:07:51.630 --> 02:07:53.665
FROM JUST CAUSE REQUIREMENTS.

02:07:53.732 --> 02:07:55.534
IT'S A CRITICAL PROVISION THAT

02:07:55.601 --> 02:07:57.603
ALLOWS OWNERS TO SECURE

02:07:57.669 --> 02:07:59.505
FINANCING AND TO MOVE FORWARD

02:07:59.571 --> 02:08:02.074

REGULATORY BURDENS. LEGISLATION

02:08:15.287 --> 02:08:17.089
REALLY SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON

02:08:17.156 --> 02:08:18.891
ENCOURAGING RECONSTRUCTION. I

02:08:18.957 --> 02:08:20.459
GOT TO SAY, THE IRONY OF THIS

02:08:20.526 --> 02:08:21.894
BILL IS WHEN THE TENANT

02:08:21.960 --> 02:08:23.996
PROTECTION ACT WAS WRITTEN, IT

02:08:24.063 --> 02:08:26.598
GIVES CITIES THE ABILITY TO

02:08:26.665 --> 02:08:29.068
IMPOSE THEIR OWN FORM OF JUST

02:08:29.134 --> 02:08:31.970

02:08:32.037 --> 02:08:33.806

WHO WANT TO DO IT, THEY CAN.

02:08:35.908 --> 02:08:36.909
SOME CITIES HAVE DECIDED THEY

02:08:36.975 --> 02:08:38.243
DON'T WANT TO DO SOMETHING LIKE

02:08:38.310 --> 02:08:39.812
THIS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO

02:08:39.878 --> 02:08:41.680
ENCOURAGE CONSTRUCTION. SO WITH

02:08:41.747 --> 02:08:43.916
THAT, WITH THAT, WE REQUEST YOUR

02:08:43.982 --> 02:08:47.352

ONE UP FOR A VOTE. MAY I MAKE

02:11:33.719 --> 02:11:34.253

SHE'S DOING THIS FOR THE

02:11:58.944 --> 02:11:59.678

02:11:59.745 --> 02:12:01.747
COUNTY RESIDENTS ARE RENTERS.

02:12:01.813 --> 02:12:04.349
THIS IS FOR THE PEOPLE IN A

02:12:04.416 --> 02:12:06.818
DISASTER. WE DO NOT DO ENOUGH

02:12:06.885 --> 02:12:08.754
FOR THE AVERAGE RENTER, AND WE

02:12:08.820 --> 02:12:11.056
HAVE BEEN WAIVING STATE LAW

02:12:11.123 --> 02:12:13.191

02:12:24.102 --> 02:12:24.736

WHICH ARE DISASTER VICTIMS. AND

02:12:26.405 --> 02:12:29.074
THIS WILL HELP PEOPLE. SO I

02:12:29.141 --> 02:12:30.575
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE

EMPLOYED BY COMPANIES VIA

02:13:13.085 --> 02:13:14.920

EXPRESSLY COVERED IN THE BILL,

02:16:33.285 --> 02:16:34.986

THANK YOU. THANK YOU, JACKIE, ON

02:18:01.039 --> 02:18:02.574

GOOD MORNING, SOPHIA QUACH, ON

BEHALF OF CHAMBER OF PROGRESS IN

02:18:08.613 --> 02:18:09.914
OPPOSITION. THANK YOU, THANK

02:18:09.981 --> 02:18:12.751

AND OPPOSE. THANK YOU. I'LL

02:18:16.921 --> 02:18:20.025
BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE,

02:18:20.091 --> 02:18:23.762
MADAM VICE CHAIR. WE'VE SEEN A

02:18:23.828 --> 02:18:24.996
COUPLE OF THESE BILLS HERE

02:18:25.063 --> 02:18:27.565
BEFORE. IT RELATES TO THE NEW

02:18:27.632 --> 02:18:31.202
TECHNOLOGIES AND BROKER DATA AND

02:18:31.269 --> 02:18:34.539
HOW TO IDENTIFY UNFAIR PRICING,

02:18:34.606 --> 02:18:37.409
ALLEGED UNFAIR PRICING. I JUST

02:18:37.475 --> 02:18:39.344
BELIEVE THAT THE MARKET RESOLVES

02:18:39.411 --> 02:18:41.913
THESE ISSUES. IF SOMEONE IS

02:18:41.980 --> 02:18:46.051
BEING TARGETED TO BUY AN APPLE

02:18:46.117 --> 02:18:48.520
PHONE THAT IS REFLECTS THEIR ZIP

02:18:48.586 --> 02:18:50.755
CODE. IF IT'S TOO HIGH, YOU

02:18:50.822 --> 02:18:52.757
DON'T BUY IT. I MEAN, PEOPLE ARE

02:18:52.824 --> 02:18:53.792
SMART. WE DON'T GIVE PEOPLE

02:18:53.858 --> 02:18:55.727
ENOUGH CREDIT. THEY CAN VOTE

02:18:55.794 --> 02:18:58.263
WITH THEIR FEET. I JUST FIND

02:18:58.329 --> 02:19:01.499
THIS OVERREGULATION IS IMPEDING

02:19:01.566 --> 02:19:02.801
HOW WE DO BUSINESS AND HOW

02:19:02.867 --> 02:19:04.402
PEOPLE WANT TO DO BUSINESS. AND

02:19:04.469 --> 02:19:06.771
NO ONE IS FORCED TO BUY A PHONE

02:19:06.838 --> 02:19:07.539
FOR WHATEVER AMOUNT THAT THEY

02:19:07.605 --> 02:19:10.075
THINK IS TOO MUCH. THEY COULD GO

02:19:10.141 --> 02:19:11.342
SOMEPLACE ELSE. THERE ARE PLENTY

02:19:11.409 --> 02:19:13.778
OF RETAIL OPERATIONS ONLINE OR

02:19:13.845 --> 02:19:15.880
IN PERSON IN PHYSICAL STORES TO

02:19:15.947 --> 02:19:17.682
FIND A BETTER PRICE. THAT'S THE

02:19:17.749 --> 02:19:20.151
NATURE OF OUR ECONOMY, AND I DO

02:19:20.218 --> 02:19:22.420
NOT SUPPORT REGULATING IN THIS

02:19:22.487 --> 02:19:24.122
WAY. BUT APPRECIATE YOU TRYING

02:19:24.189 --> 02:19:25.690
TO. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU I

02:19:25.757 --> 02:19:27.158
RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE. THANK

02:19:27.225 --> 02:19:28.226
YOU, SENATOR. THANK YOU. OTHER

02:19:28.293 --> 02:19:30.929
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THANK

02:19:30.995 --> 02:19:32.330
YOU, SENATOR, FOR BRINGING THIS

02:19:32.397 --> 02:19:33.198
FORWARD. I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE

02:19:33.264 --> 02:19:37.168
WITH MY VICE CHAIR. I DON'T I

02:19:37.235 --> 02:19:38.002
THINK IT'S ONE THING TO HAVE

02:19:38.069 --> 02:19:41.072
MARKET COMPETITION. ABSOLUTELY.

02:19:41.139 --> 02:19:43.141
TO REDUCE PRICES AND WHAT HAVE

02:19:43.208 --> 02:19:45.110
YOU. THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS

02:19:45.176 --> 02:19:47.979
ABOUT. AND I COMPLETELY AGREE ON

02:19:48.046 --> 02:19:49.514
THE ON THE POINT ON WHAT THE

02:19:49.581 --> 02:19:51.082
AUTHOR IS TRYING TO DO WITH

02:19:51.149 --> 02:19:53.284
GEOLOCATION. I THINK THAT THE

02:19:53.351 --> 02:19:54.819
INDUSTRY AND THE COMPANIES AND

02:19:54.886 --> 02:19:55.820
THE BUSINESSES SHOULD HAVE TO

02:19:55.887 --> 02:19:57.956
ARGUE AS TO WHY THEY NEED OUR

02:19:58.022 --> 02:19:59.290
LOCATION. NOT THAT THERE SHOULD

02:19:59.357 --> 02:20:01.226
BE A BLANKET ALLOWANCE FOR IT.

02:20:01.292 --> 02:20:03.495
AND THE OTHER WAY AROUND, WE

02:20:03.561 --> 02:20:04.529
HAVE TO PROTECT CONSUMERS.

02:20:04.596 --> 02:20:05.163
THERE'S NO REASON WHY YOU NEED

02:20:05.230 --> 02:20:07.132
THE GEOLOCATION OF A CONSUMER

02:20:07.198 --> 02:20:10.201
FOR SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES. SIMPLY,

02:20:10.268 --> 02:20:12.437
I JUST DON'T BUY THAT. ARE THERE

02:20:12.504 --> 02:20:13.605
SOME SITUATIONS OR OCCASIONS

02:20:13.671 --> 02:20:15.640
WHERE IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY? I

02:20:15.707 --> 02:20:17.776
DON'T KNOW, BUT THAT'S WHERE

02:20:17.842 --> 02:20:19.911
THOSE CASES NEED TO BE MADE

02:20:19.978 --> 02:20:22.180
THAT, YOU KNOW, THESE ARE THE

02:20:22.247 --> 02:20:25.283
SITUATIONS WHERE IT ACTUALLY,

02:20:25.350 --> 02:20:26.851
OTHER THAN MARKET MANIPULATION

02:20:26.918 --> 02:20:28.553
OR TREATING CONSUMERS

02:20:28.620 --> 02:20:30.021
DIFFERENTLY BASED UPON WHAT KIND

02:20:30.088 --> 02:20:31.289
OF APP THEY HAVE OR HOW NEW

02:20:31.356 --> 02:20:33.958
THEIR PHONE IS, I THINK THAT

02:20:34.025 --> 02:20:35.460
SHOULD ABSOLUTELY NOT BE

02:20:35.527 --> 02:20:40.098
ALLOWED. AND SO I, I APPRECIATE

02:20:40.165 --> 02:20:41.466
THE DIRECTION THAT THE AUTHOR

02:20:41.533 --> 02:20:45.770
HAS GONE IN. AND IN, I THINK

02:20:45.837 --> 02:20:47.205
BETTER FINE TUNING THE

02:20:47.272 --> 02:20:48.339
LEGISLATION. THERE'S PROBABLY

02:20:48.406 --> 02:20:50.141
SOME MORE WORK THERE. AND I KNOW

02:20:50.208 --> 02:20:51.176
THAT THAT'S WHAT THIS PROCESS IS

02:20:51.242 --> 02:20:52.877
ABOUT. AS YOU MOVE FORWARD,

02:20:52.944 --> 02:20:55.213
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE? YES.

02:20:55.280 --> 02:20:56.548
FIRST AND FOREMOST, I JUST WANT

02:20:56.614 --> 02:20:58.183
TO SAY, AS A PERSON WHO ACTUALLY

02:20:58.249 --> 02:20:59.818
WORKED IN TECHNOLOGY AND KNOWING

02:20:59.884 --> 02:21:01.586
HOW SOME OF THESE ALGORITHMS ARE

02:21:01.653 --> 02:21:04.556
DESIGNED, IF YOU SAW THE

02:21:04.622 --> 02:21:05.957
OPPOSITION, IT WAS ALL INDUSTRY

02:21:06.024 --> 02:21:07.292
GROUPS. THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE

02:21:07.358 --> 02:21:09.828
CONSUMER GROUP THAT WAS IN

02:21:09.894 --> 02:21:11.496
OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL. AND THE

02:21:11.563 --> 02:21:13.164
REASON FOR IT IS HONESTLY THAT

02:21:13.231 --> 02:21:14.265
BY SUPPORTING THIS BILL, YOU

02:21:14.332 --> 02:21:16.100
ACTUALLY SUPPORT CONSUMERS. YOU

02:21:16.167 --> 02:21:18.503
SUPPORT CONSUMERS WHEN THEY ARE

02:21:18.570 --> 02:21:21.039
AT 10% BATTERY LIFE AND COMING

02:21:21.105 --> 02:21:23.208
OUT OF AN AIRPORT OR SOME LATE

02:21:23.274 --> 02:21:25.743
NIGHT DECISION, AND THEY ARE

02:21:25.810 --> 02:21:28.680
TRYING TO HAIL A RIDE. AND THE

02:21:28.746 --> 02:21:31.149
FACT IS THAT THEY ARE PRICE

02:21:31.216 --> 02:21:32.984
GOUGED BECAUSE OF NECESSITY OF

02:21:33.051 --> 02:21:36.287
NEEDING A RIDE OR SOME OTHER

02:21:36.354 --> 02:21:39.324
EFFORT. AND WHEN THEY ARE BEING

02:21:39.390 --> 02:21:41.259
PRICE GOUGED, THEY ARE UNAWARE

02:21:41.326 --> 02:21:43.061
OF IT. THEY ARE COMPLETELY

02:21:43.127 --> 02:21:44.896
UNAWARE OF WHAT PRICES ARE

02:21:44.963 --> 02:21:47.398
AVAILABLE. IF THEY CAN ORDER

02:21:47.465 --> 02:21:48.333
SOMETHING ELSE OR WHATEVER THE

02:21:48.399 --> 02:21:50.702
CASE MAY BE. WE HAVE BEEN SEEING

02:21:50.768 --> 02:21:53.771
THIS ACROSS THE BOARD AND THE

02:21:53.838 --> 02:21:55.773
MARKET WON'T JUST ADJUST ITSELF.

02:21:55.840 --> 02:21:57.742
THE MARKET ONLY ADJUSTS ITSELF

02:21:57.809 --> 02:22:00.011
IS WHEN THERE'S A COURT CASE,

02:22:00.078 --> 02:22:01.813
WHEN THERE'S A LAWSUIT, WHEN

02:22:01.880 --> 02:22:04.349
THERE IS A PENALTY FOR EVEN

02:22:04.415 --> 02:22:06.885
BEHAVING IN THIS MANNER. AND THE

02:22:06.951 --> 02:22:10.788
REALITY IS THIS POLICY DOES NOT

02:22:10.855 --> 02:22:13.224
MOVE AS FAST AS TECHNOLOGY. AND

02:22:13.291 --> 02:22:14.659
WE ARE SEEING MORE AND MORE

02:22:14.726 --> 02:22:16.494
PEOPLE BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF,

02:22:16.561 --> 02:22:17.629
ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE

02:22:17.695 --> 02:22:18.997
COMMUNITIES, ESPECIALLY EVEN

02:22:19.063 --> 02:22:20.798
SENIORS, SENIORS WHO ARE USING

02:22:20.865 --> 02:22:23.601
THIS THAT MAY BE MORE AT HOME

02:22:23.668 --> 02:22:25.503
AND TRYING TO ORDER SOMETHING

02:22:25.570 --> 02:22:27.305
FOR THEMSELVES AND ARE ON FIXED

02:22:27.372 --> 02:22:29.107
INCOMES. AND AGAIN, THINKING

02:22:29.173 --> 02:22:31.009
THAT THIS IS FAIR RIGHT NOW, THE

02:22:31.075 --> 02:22:32.744
MARKET IS NOT FAIR FOR A

02:22:32.810 --> 02:22:34.612
CONSUMER. AND SO THE TYPE OF

02:22:34.679 --> 02:22:35.880
BILLS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO

02:22:35.947 --> 02:22:37.382
BRING FORWARD IS TO JUST BALANCE

02:22:37.448 --> 02:22:40.585
THE SCALES AND MAKE SURE THAT

02:22:40.652 --> 02:22:42.820
PEOPLE ARE TREATED FAIRLY. THIS

02:22:42.887 --> 02:22:44.956
TYPE OF MANIPULATION DIDN'T

02:22:45.023 --> 02:22:46.724
EXIST 20 YEARS AGO, 30 YEARS

02:22:46.791 --> 02:22:50.361
AGO, 40 YEARS AGO. AND SO AS

02:22:50.428 --> 02:22:53.164
MANY LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WE

02:22:53.231 --> 02:22:54.265
HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:22:54.332 --> 02:22:56.100
BUSINESSES OPERATE IN GOOD

02:22:56.167 --> 02:22:57.435
FAITH. WE DON'T HAVE IT IN THE

02:22:57.502 --> 02:22:59.070
TECH SPACE, AND WE NEED TO

02:22:59.137 --> 02:23:00.538
ENSURE THAT WE ARE MOVING IN

02:23:00.605 --> 02:23:01.606
THAT DIRECTION. SO I

02:23:01.673 --> 02:23:03.107
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE

02:23:03.174 --> 02:23:04.242
VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND

02:23:04.309 --> 02:23:07.345
WE'LL GET TO THAT AS SOON AS WE

02:23:07.412 --> 02:23:11.683
CAN. UP NEXT IS ITEM FIVE SB

02:23:11.749 --> 02:23:21.359
261, WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. ALL

02:23:21.426 --> 02:23:23.261
RIGHT, CHAIR AND COMMITTEE

02:23:23.328 --> 02:23:24.662
MEMBERS, BEFORE I BEGIN, I WANT

02:23:24.729 --> 02:23:26.030
TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR

02:23:26.097 --> 02:23:27.832
THEIR HELP WITH THIS BILL.

02:23:27.899 --> 02:23:30.401
REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT. SB 261

02:23:30.468 --> 02:23:31.736
SUPPORTS LOCAL ENFORCEMENT OF

02:23:31.803 --> 02:23:33.304
WAGE THEFT JUDGMENTS BY

02:23:33.371 --> 02:23:34.305
REQUIRING THE LABOR

02:23:34.372 --> 02:23:36.007
COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE TO CREATE

02:23:36.074 --> 02:23:38.776
A PUBLIC LIST OF EMPLOYERS WITH

02:23:38.843 --> 02:23:40.411
OUTSTANDING JUDGMENTS. IT ALSO

02:23:40.478 --> 02:23:42.046
AUTHORIZES ADDITIONAL PENALTIES

02:23:42.113 --> 02:23:43.681
OF THREE TIMES THE OUTSTANDING

02:23:43.748 --> 02:23:45.817
JUDGMENT. AFTER SIX MONTHS OF

02:23:45.883 --> 02:23:47.685
NONPAYMENT, THE EXISTING PROCESS

02:23:47.752 --> 02:23:49.153
TO FILE AND PURSUE A WAGE THEFT

02:23:49.220 --> 02:23:50.421
CLAIM IS LONG AND BURDENSOME,

02:23:50.488 --> 02:23:52.857
OFTEN TAKING MONTHS OR YEARS.

02:23:52.924 --> 02:23:55.159
EVEN AFTER THE AE ISSUES A

02:23:55.226 --> 02:23:56.861
JUDGMENT, EMPLOYERS OFTEN DON'T

02:23:56.928 --> 02:23:59.364
PAY. THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S

02:23:59.430 --> 02:24:01.232
OFFICE FOUND THAT WORKERS

02:24:01.299 --> 02:24:02.800
REPORTED COLLECTING LESS THAN A

02:24:02.867 --> 02:24:06.037
FIFTH OF UNPAID WAGES THEY WERE

02:24:06.104 --> 02:24:07.839
OWED. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT

02:24:07.905 --> 02:24:08.373
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS

02:24:08.439 --> 02:24:11.075
VULNERABLE GROUPS IN OUR STATE.

02:24:11.142 --> 02:24:12.910

EXPERIENCE WAGE THEFT, ACCORDING

02:24:23.254 --> 02:24:25.123
TO A RUTGERS STUDY. THIS BILL

02:24:25.189 --> 02:24:27.125
WILL GIVE ENFORCEMENT SOME TEETH

02:24:27.191 --> 02:24:29.127
AND PUSH NON-COMPLIANT EMPLOYERS

02:24:29.193 --> 02:24:31.229

02:25:04.395 --> 02:25:05.897
NAME IS RAVI RAJENDRA. AS THE

02:25:05.963 --> 02:25:07.432
SENATOR SAID, I'M DEPUTY COUNTY

02:25:07.498 --> 02:25:08.099
COUNSEL WITH SANTA CLARA COUNTY.

02:25:08.166 --> 02:25:10.468
I SPEAK TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB

02:25:10.535 --> 02:25:11.803
261. MY CAREER HAS BEEN

02:25:11.869 --> 02:25:13.438
COMMITTED AND DEDICATED TO

02:25:13.504 --> 02:25:14.172
SUPPORTING THE WELL-BEING OF

02:25:14.238 --> 02:25:15.473
WORKING PEOPLE, INCLUDING LOW

02:25:15.540 --> 02:25:16.607
WAGE WORKERS AND THOSE FROM

02:25:16.674 --> 02:25:18.409
OTHER VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. IN

02:25:18.476 --> 02:25:19.410
PRIVATE PRACTICE, I REPRESENTED

02:25:19.477 --> 02:25:21.012
LABOR UNIONS, LOW WAGE WORKERS

02:25:21.079 --> 02:25:22.280
AND NONPROFIT GROUPS SUPPORTING

02:25:22.346 --> 02:25:23.648
THEM FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS AT

02:25:23.714 --> 02:25:24.882
THE COUNTY, I'VE ADVISED THE

02:25:24.949 --> 02:25:25.950
OFFICE OF LABOR STANDARDS

02:25:26.017 --> 02:25:27.385
ENFORCEMENT AND WORKED ON A TEAM

02:25:27.452 --> 02:25:29.053
WITHIN MY OFFICE DEDICATED TO

02:25:29.120 --> 02:25:30.388
WORKERS RIGHTS, INCLUDING IN

02:25:30.455 --> 02:25:31.255
ROBUST PARTNERSHIP WITH THE

02:25:31.322 --> 02:25:33.858
LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE. SB

02:25:33.925 --> 02:25:35.326
261 TACKLES WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL

02:25:35.393 --> 02:25:37.028
THE LAST MILE PROBLEM FOR

02:25:37.095 --> 02:25:38.296
JUDGMENT ENFORCEMENT. THE BILL

02:25:38.362 --> 02:25:39.997
PICKS UP THE STORY OF A

02:25:40.064 --> 02:25:41.866
VIOLATION OF A WORKER'S RIGHTS

02:25:41.933 --> 02:25:43.734
AT WHAT ONE MIGHT HOPE IS

02:25:43.801 --> 02:25:44.635
ALREADY THE END, AFTER ALL DUE

02:25:44.702 --> 02:25:47.638
PROCESS HAS BEEN COMPLETED AND A

02:25:47.705 --> 02:25:48.873
JUDGMENT IS OWED. LET'S IMAGINE

02:25:48.940 --> 02:25:50.007
A WORKER, A LOW WAGE WORKER

02:25:50.074 --> 02:25:51.309
WHO'S CONCERNED THAT THEY

02:25:51.375 --> 02:25:52.243
HAVEN'T BEEN PAID WHAT THEY'RE

02:25:52.310 --> 02:25:54.479
OWED. THIS IS A LOW WAGE,

02:25:54.545 --> 02:25:55.246
MINIMUM WAGE, LOW WAGE, MINIMUM

02:25:55.313 --> 02:25:56.314
WAGE, VULNERABLE WORKER WHO'S

02:25:56.380 --> 02:25:57.849
JUST SCRAPING BY, NOT SOMEONE

02:25:57.915 --> 02:26:00.051
WITH SEVERAL MONTHS OF SAVINGS,

02:26:00.118 --> 02:26:02.253
OR PARENTS WHO ARE GOING TO BAIL

02:26:02.320 --> 02:26:03.354
THEM OUT. NOW, THE AVERAGE

02:26:03.421 --> 02:26:05.389
AMOUNT STOLEN FROM A WORKER LIKE

02:26:05.456 --> 02:26:06.491
THIS. THIS IS ACCORDING TO THE

02:26:06.557 --> 02:26:07.992
ECONOMIC POLICY INSTITUTE

02:26:08.059 --> 02:26:09.560
NATIONWIDE DATA, THE AVERAGE

02:26:09.627 --> 02:26:11.028
AMOUNT STOLEN FROM A MINIMUM

02:26:11.095 --> 02:26:12.997
WAGE WORKER IN A YEAR REPRESENTS

02:26:13.064 --> 02:26:14.832
50 FILL UPS AT THE GAS STATION,

02:26:14.899 --> 02:26:16.067
100 BAGS OF DIAPERS FOR THEIR

02:26:16.134 --> 02:26:17.301
BABIES, MONTHS AND MONTHS OF

02:26:17.368 --> 02:26:19.036
RENT. SO THIS IS NOT JUST A

02:26:19.103 --> 02:26:20.037
COUPLE OF DOLLARS HERE AND

02:26:20.104 --> 02:26:21.639
THERE. THIS WORKERS ALREADY HAVE

02:26:21.706 --> 02:26:22.840
THE COURAGE AND FORTITUDE TO

02:26:22.907 --> 02:26:24.609
CLAIM PUBLICLY THAT THEY WEREN'T

02:26:24.675 --> 02:26:25.476
PAID. THEY WENT THROUGH WHAT THE

02:26:25.543 --> 02:26:27.278
SENATOR DESCRIBED AS A LONG

02:26:27.345 --> 02:26:28.146
PROCESS TO GET THE LABOR

02:26:28.212 --> 02:26:29.380
COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE TO

02:26:29.447 --> 02:26:30.481
INVESTIGATE THE EMPLOYER CLAIM,

02:26:30.548 --> 02:26:32.550
AND HAD DUE PROCESS, AND

02:26:32.617 --> 02:26:34.318
CHALLENGED THE CLAIM THAT THEY

02:26:34.385 --> 02:26:36.087
HAD COMMITTED WAGE THEFT. AND A

02:26:36.154 --> 02:26:37.188
JUDGE HAS ALREADY ISSUED AN

02:26:37.255 --> 02:26:38.723
ORDER AGREEING THAT WAGE THEFT

02:26:38.789 --> 02:26:39.790
OCCURRED AND DIRECTING THE

02:26:39.857 --> 02:26:41.225
EMPLOYER TO PAY THEM. NOW,

02:26:41.292 --> 02:26:43.094
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THE END OF

02:26:43.161 --> 02:26:45.029
THE STORY, AND I SHOULD BE ABLE

02:26:45.096 --> 02:26:46.430
TO GO HOME. BUT THE DATA SHOWS

02:26:46.497 --> 02:26:47.999
AND OUR EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT IN

02:26:48.065 --> 02:26:49.200
MOST CASES, EMPLOYERS STILL

02:26:49.267 --> 02:26:50.334
DON'T PAY WHAT A JUDGE HAS TOLD

02:26:50.401 --> 02:26:51.969
THEM TO PAY. WHY? BECAUSE

02:26:52.036 --> 02:26:53.070
THERE'S NO REAL CONSEQUENCE FOR

02:26:53.137 --> 02:26:55.506
AN EMPLOYER TO IGNORE THAT

02:26:55.573 --> 02:26:56.474
JUDGMENT. MOST WORKERS DON'T

02:26:56.541 --> 02:26:59.410
KNOW WHAT TO DO NEXT. SB 261

02:26:59.477 --> 02:27:00.945
DOES TWO THINGS TO RIGHT THIS

02:27:01.012 --> 02:27:02.780
WRONG. FIRST, IT IMPOSES

02:27:02.847 --> 02:27:04.549
ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL PENALTIES

02:27:04.615 --> 02:27:06.384
ON EMPLOYERS WHO CONTINUE TO

02:27:06.450 --> 02:27:08.553
REFUSE TO PAY JUDGMENTS HALF A

02:27:08.619 --> 02:27:10.154
YEAR AFTER THE JUDGE HAS ALREADY

02:27:10.221 --> 02:27:11.656
DECIDED THEY'RE DUE, AND IMPOSES

02:27:11.722 --> 02:27:13.357
BACK ON THE EMPLOYER THE COSTS

02:27:13.424 --> 02:27:15.092
THAT THE WORKER NEEDS TO TAKE ON

02:27:15.159 --> 02:27:17.094
JUST TO DO THAT COLLECTION. AND

02:27:17.161 --> 02:27:17.895
SECOND, IT ASKS THE AE TO

02:27:17.962 --> 02:27:19.163
CENTRALLY LOCATE A LIST OF

02:27:19.230 --> 02:27:20.298
EMPLOYERS WITH FINAL JUDGMENTS

02:27:20.364 --> 02:27:21.532
AGAINST THEM THAT HAVEN'T BEEN

02:27:21.599 --> 02:27:22.833
PAID. I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY

02:27:22.900 --> 02:27:24.302
QUESTIONS AND I URGE YOU TO

02:27:24.368 --> 02:27:26.470
SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY

02:27:26.537 --> 02:27:27.238
MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU,

02:27:27.305 --> 02:27:28.339
MR. CHAIR. MEMBER SARA FLOCKS,

02:27:28.406 --> 02:27:29.807
CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF LABOR

02:27:29.874 --> 02:27:31.742
UNIONS, WE'RE PROUD TO

02:27:31.809 --> 02:27:32.977
CO-SPONSOR THIS BILL AS PART OF

02:27:33.044 --> 02:27:35.179
A PACKAGE WE'RE DOING TO MAKE

02:27:35.246 --> 02:27:37.215
THE ENFORCEMENT OF WAGE THEFT

02:27:37.281 --> 02:27:39.517
MORE EFFICIENT IN THE STATE.

02:27:39.584 --> 02:27:42.320
AND, YOU KNOW, THE AUTHOR TALKED

02:27:42.386 --> 02:27:43.721
ABOUT, WHEN YOU GET TO THIS

02:27:43.788 --> 02:27:45.923
FINAL POINT WHERE THERE IS A

02:27:45.990 --> 02:27:48.459
JUDGMENT ISSUED WHERE THE

02:27:48.526 --> 02:27:50.261
EMPLOYER HAS BEEN FOUND GUILTY

02:27:50.328 --> 02:27:52.930
AND OWES A WORKER WHAT IT TAKES

02:27:52.997 --> 02:27:55.600
TO GET THERE IS UNBELIEVABLE. A

02:27:55.666 --> 02:27:58.502
WORKER FILES A CLAIM. THEY MAY

02:27:58.569 --> 02:28:01.672
HAVE TO WAIT 386 DAYS ON

02:28:01.739 --> 02:28:03.140
AVERAGE, TO GET A NOTICE OF A

02:28:03.207 --> 02:28:04.709
CLAIM OR A SETTLEMENT

02:28:04.775 --> 02:28:07.545
CONFERENCE. AN ADDITIONAL 636

02:28:07.612 --> 02:28:09.847
DAYS, ACCORDING TO ADVOCATES, TO

02:28:09.914 --> 02:28:12.283
GET THAT HEARING. AND THEN

02:28:12.350 --> 02:28:14.018
ANOTHER WAY TO GET THE ORDER,

02:28:14.085 --> 02:28:16.487
DECISION OR AWARD. AT THAT

02:28:16.554 --> 02:28:19.023
POINT, EMPLOYERS COULD DECIDE

02:28:19.090 --> 02:28:21.492
NOT TO PAY WITHOUT ANY KIND OF

02:28:21.559 --> 02:28:23.494
PENALTY, ANY REAL PENALTY. SO

02:28:23.561 --> 02:28:25.796
THE WHOLE SYSTEM AT THIS POINT

02:28:25.863 --> 02:28:28.199
IS IN THE EMPLOYER'S FAVOR TO

02:28:28.266 --> 02:28:30.201
STARVE OUT WORKERS TO THE POINT

02:28:30.268 --> 02:28:32.403
WHERE THEY CAN'T PAY THEIR RENT

02:28:32.470 --> 02:28:33.504
BECAUSE THEY'VE HAD THEIR WAGES

02:28:33.571 --> 02:28:34.939
STOLEN, THEY'RE EVICTED, THEY

02:28:35.006 --> 02:28:36.307
LOSE THEIR CELL PHONE COVERAGE,

02:28:36.374 --> 02:28:38.876
THEY LOSE INTERNET ACCESS AT ANY

02:28:38.943 --> 02:28:40.745
POINT. THEIR CLAIM COULD BE

02:28:40.811 --> 02:28:42.113
DROPPED IF THEY DON'T SHOW UP.

02:28:42.179 --> 02:28:43.981
AND SO WHAT THIS IS TRYING TO DO

02:28:44.048 --> 02:28:46.450
IS REALLY CREATE THAT

02:28:46.517 --> 02:28:48.319
DISINCENTIVE FOR WORKERS, FOR

02:28:48.386 --> 02:28:49.654
EMPLOYERS TO DO THAT, BECAUSE

02:28:49.720 --> 02:28:51.856
WHAT WE REALLY WANT IS FOR THEM

02:28:51.922 --> 02:28:53.691
TO JUST GIVE WORKERS THE MONEY

02:28:53.758 --> 02:28:55.893
THAT THEY EARNED. AND SO FOR

02:28:55.960 --> 02:28:57.461
THOSE REASONS, WE URGE YOUR

02:28:57.528 --> 02:28:59.030
SUPPORT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

02:28:59.096 --> 02:29:00.731
IS THERE ANYONE ELSE HERE IN

02:29:00.798 --> 02:29:03.467

SENATOR, I WILL SUPPORT THIS

02:29:51.549 --> 02:29:54.518
BILL. GOOD, GOOD I APPRECIATE

02:29:54.585 --> 02:29:56.287
THAT, BUT LET ME JUST TELL YOU

02:29:56.354 --> 02:29:59.457
FROM MY OWN LIMITED EXPERIENCE,

02:29:59.523 --> 02:30:00.991
HAVING BEEN COGNIZANT OF THESE

02:30:01.058 --> 02:30:03.661
ISSUES AS A AS A LEGISLATOR,

02:30:03.728 --> 02:30:05.262
IT'S NOT JUST BUSINESS. SO I'M

02:30:05.329 --> 02:30:06.630
SUPPORTIVE AND NOT JUST AN

02:30:06.697 --> 02:30:08.899
EMPLOYER. STATE AGENCIES HAVE

02:30:08.966 --> 02:30:10.901
ISSUES. JUST LAST WEEK IN THE

02:30:10.968 --> 02:30:13.237
APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE, WE

02:30:13.304 --> 02:30:16.474
VOTED TO SUPPORT THE PAYMENT OF

02:30:16.540 --> 02:30:19.310
602 TWO REQUESTS FOR CLAIMS,

02:30:19.377 --> 02:30:21.112
$600. NOT I THOUGHT WE ALL

02:30:21.178 --> 02:30:25.483
THOUGHT IT WAS A TYPO.

02:30:25.549 --> 02:30:28.652
$600,600,600 TO ONE CLAIMANT AND

02:30:28.719 --> 02:30:30.721
$72 TO ANOTHER CLAIMANT TO TWO

02:30:30.788 --> 02:30:31.856
STATE AGENCIES WHO FILED A CLAIM

02:30:31.922 --> 02:30:35.493
IN THE YEAR 2005 YEARS AGO. SO

02:30:35.559 --> 02:30:37.428
IT HAPPENS EVERYWHERE. AND MAYBE

02:30:37.495 --> 02:30:39.463
WE NEED TO HAVE AND SIMILARLY,

02:30:39.530 --> 02:30:41.732
I'M VERY MUCH INVOLVED IN ISSUES

02:30:41.799 --> 02:30:42.633
RELATED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:30:42.700 --> 02:30:44.435
HEALTH CARE SERVICES BECAUSE OF

02:30:44.502 --> 02:30:47.405
DRUG REHABILITATION AND ALCOHOL

02:30:47.471 --> 02:30:51.308
REHABILITATION IN MY COUNTY, AND

02:30:51.375 --> 02:30:53.177
CLAIMS COMPLAINT TO THAT AGENCY.

02:30:53.244 --> 02:30:54.345
AND I DON'T MEAN TO SINGLE THEM

02:30:54.412 --> 02:30:55.813
OUT IF THEY'RE LISTENING,

02:30:55.880 --> 02:30:57.415
BECAUSE THIS HAPPENS IN MANY

02:30:57.481 --> 02:31:00.284
OTHER AGENCIES ARE NOT ADDRESSED

02:31:00.351 --> 02:31:02.119
FOR OVER A YEAR. AND SO I

02:31:02.186 --> 02:31:03.988
ACTUALLY HAD A BILL TO PUT A 60

02:31:04.054 --> 02:31:06.857
DAY TIME LIMIT ON THIS. SO I

02:31:06.924 --> 02:31:07.525
APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

02:31:07.591 --> 02:31:09.627
DO. PEOPLE, IF THEY DESERVE TO

02:31:09.693 --> 02:31:10.928
BE PAID AND COMPENSATED FOR WORK

02:31:10.995 --> 02:31:12.430
THAT WAS DONE, THEY ABSOLUTELY

02:31:12.496 --> 02:31:14.165
SHOULD BE PAID. ABSOLUTELY. BUT

02:31:14.231 --> 02:31:15.866
I WOULD SAY THE LARGER MESSAGE

02:31:15.933 --> 02:31:17.635
IS ANYBODY WHO OWES ANYBODY ANY

02:31:17.701 --> 02:31:19.036
MONEY BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

02:31:19.103 --> 02:31:20.805

WITH VALLEY FEVER COMPLICATIONS

02:35:12.036 --> 02:35:15.706
IN 2019. HER ORDEAL BEGAN IN

02:35:15.773 --> 02:35:17.474
2005, WHEN A NODULE WAS

02:35:17.541 --> 02:35:18.475
DISCOVERED ON A LOBE OF HER

02:35:18.542 --> 02:35:20.778
LUNG. WHILE TUBERCULOSIS AND

02:35:20.844 --> 02:35:22.346
CANCER WERE QUICKLY RULED OUT,

02:35:22.413 --> 02:35:24.648
VALLEY FEVER WASN'T EVEN

02:35:24.715 --> 02:35:25.749
CONSIDERED. DESPITE HER LIVING

02:35:25.816 --> 02:35:28.218
IN BAKERSFIELD, WHERE IT IS

02:35:28.285 --> 02:35:29.887
PREVALENT, SHE WAS SIMPLY PLACED

02:35:29.953 --> 02:35:31.689
ON A MONITOR IN WAIT AND SEE

02:35:31.755 --> 02:35:36.026

02:35:37.928 --> 02:35:41.532
JOURNEY AS THE NODULE HAD GROWN

02:35:41.598 --> 02:35:43.767
CONSIDERABLY. SHE CODED WAS IN

02:35:43.834 --> 02:35:46.704
THE COMA, A LENGTHY, LENGTHY

02:35:46.770 --> 02:35:48.839
HOSPITAL STAY WHERE SHE WAS THEN

02:35:48.906 --> 02:35:50.908
LED INTO SURGERY, AND IT WAS

02:35:50.974 --> 02:35:51.875
DETERMINED HER ENTIRE LUNG

02:35:51.942 --> 02:35:54.178
NEEDED TO BE REMOVED BECAUSE HER

02:35:54.244 --> 02:35:55.913
CHANCE OF SURVIVAL WAS GOING TO

02:35:55.979 --> 02:35:58.449
BE SLIM. IT WAS ONLY AFTER THIS

02:35:58.515 --> 02:35:59.516
DISEASE LUNG WAS REMOVED THAT IT

02:35:59.583 --> 02:36:01.618
WAS SENT TO PATHOLOGY AND

02:36:01.685 --> 02:36:02.653
FINALLY TESTED POSITIVE FOR

02:36:02.720 --> 02:36:05.222
VALLEY FEVER WHILE SHE WAS IN A

02:36:05.289 --> 02:36:06.757
MEDICALLY INDUCED COMA, WE

02:36:06.824 --> 02:36:08.826
ARRANGED TO MOVE HER UP NORTH SO

02:36:08.892 --> 02:36:09.960
SHE COULD LIVE WITH ME. BY MAY

02:36:10.027 --> 02:36:12.529
OF 2010, SHE WAS FINALLY HOME,

02:36:12.596 --> 02:36:14.998
BUT HER LIFE HAD IRREVOCABLY

02:36:15.065 --> 02:36:16.567
CHANGED. THE INDEPENDENT WOMAN

02:36:16.633 --> 02:36:19.303
WHO RODE HORSES, VOLUNTEERED,

02:36:19.369 --> 02:36:20.370
SOCIALIZED AND WORKED FULL TIME

02:36:20.437 --> 02:36:22.573
WAS GONE. IN HER PLACE WAS A

02:36:22.639 --> 02:36:24.341
WOMAN DEPENDENT ON AN OXYGEN

02:36:24.408 --> 02:36:26.243
BOTTLE, LIVING IN AN UNFAMILIAR

02:36:26.310 --> 02:36:27.811
AREA WITH NO FRIENDS, AND NOW

02:36:27.878 --> 02:36:30.414
HAVING TO TRACK HER VITALS DAILY

02:36:30.481 --> 02:36:31.949
TO KEEP TRACK OF HOW EVERYTHING

02:36:32.015 --> 02:36:34.852
WAS GOING. SHE WAS ONLY 59 YEARS

02:36:34.918 --> 02:36:37.020
OLD. HAVING A PARENT MOVE IN

02:36:37.087 --> 02:36:38.355
WITH YOU, NEEDING EVEN THE

02:36:38.422 --> 02:36:40.524
SLIGHTEST OF ASSISTANCE NOT ONLY

02:36:40.591 --> 02:36:42.326
CHANGES THE DYNAMICS OF THE

02:36:42.392 --> 02:36:43.494
RELATIONSHIP, BUT IT PLACES MORE

02:36:43.560 --> 02:36:45.229
WORK ON THE ADULT CHILD TO

02:36:45.295 --> 02:36:46.363
ENSURE THEIR PARENT'S NEEDS ARE

02:36:46.430 --> 02:36:48.532
MET. MANY SLEEPLESS NIGHTS WERE

02:36:48.599 --> 02:36:50.234
SPENT LISTENING TO HER COUGH,

02:36:50.300 --> 02:36:52.069
MAKING SURE IT DIDN'T TURN INTO

02:36:52.136 --> 02:36:53.437
GASPING. COOKING BECAME A

02:36:53.504 --> 02:36:55.072
CHALLENGE BECAUSE, WELL, OXYGEN

02:36:55.139 --> 02:36:56.673
AND A STOVE DON'T GO WELL

02:36:56.740 --> 02:36:58.509
TOGETHER. I WAS PERPETUALLY

02:36:58.575 --> 02:36:59.943
KEEPING TRACK OF ALL OF HER

02:37:00.010 --> 02:37:01.078
DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENTS AND

02:37:01.145 --> 02:37:02.179
ASSISTING HER WITH EVERYTHING IN

02:37:02.246 --> 02:37:03.914
BETWEEN, WHILE TRYING TO HOLD

02:37:03.981 --> 02:37:05.582
DOWN MY OWN VERY BUSY, FULL TIME

02:37:05.649 --> 02:37:07.951
JOB. I LOVED MY MOTHER DEARLY. I

02:37:08.018 --> 02:37:10.687
WOULD DO THIS ALL AGAIN, BUT IT

02:37:10.754 --> 02:37:12.356
STRAINED THE TEN YEARS OF OUR

02:37:12.422 --> 02:37:14.091
RELATIONSHIP. I'M ALMOST DONE.

02:37:14.158 --> 02:37:15.425
WHILE INITIALLY SHE REMAINED

02:37:15.492 --> 02:37:16.927
ACTIVE, DOING MANY THINGS TO

02:37:16.994 --> 02:37:18.896
KEEP HER BUSY, SHE CONSTANTLY

02:37:18.962 --> 02:37:20.497
BATTLED THE AFTERMATH OF VALLEY

02:37:20.564 --> 02:37:21.999
FEVER. HER REMAINING LUNG WAS

02:37:22.065 --> 02:37:24.401
ALSO DISEASED, WITH ABOUT 30%

02:37:24.468 --> 02:37:26.570
LOSS OF FUNCTION. AS TIME WENT

02:37:26.637 --> 02:37:27.905
ON, MANY OF HER ACTIVITIES

02:37:27.971 --> 02:37:29.473
BECAME TOO CUMBERSOME AND

02:37:29.540 --> 02:37:31.942
LEAVING THE HOUSE MORE OF A

02:37:32.009 --> 02:37:33.410
CHALLENGE, LEAVING HER HOUSE

02:37:33.477 --> 02:37:35.979
RIDDEN AND FRUSTRATED. BY 2019,

02:37:38.248 --> 02:37:40.250
ISSUES. VALLEY FEVER FLAREUPS

02:37:40.317 --> 02:37:41.752
BECAME ALMOST MONTHLY

02:37:41.819 --> 02:37:42.986
OCCURRENCES, AND HER BODY, AFTER

02:37:43.053 --> 02:37:44.588

JACK ANDERSON WITH THE COUNTY

02:38:37.941 --> 02:38:39.376
HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION OF

02:38:39.443 --> 02:38:40.577
CALIFORNIA. WE ARE IN AN OPPOSED

02:38:40.644 --> 02:38:41.912
UNLESS AMENDED POSITION AND LOOK

02:38:41.979 --> 02:38:43.013
FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK

02:38:43.080 --> 02:38:45.182
WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE. THANK

02:38:45.249 --> 02:38:47.651
YOU, THANK YOU. ANY QUESTIONS OR

02:38:47.718 --> 02:38:48.218
COMMENTS, MADAM VICE CHAIR?

02:38:48.285 --> 02:38:52.322
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. SO IS THIS

02:38:52.389 --> 02:38:54.024
JUST BASICALLY FOR COMMUNICATION

02:38:54.091 --> 02:38:56.393
TO MAKE PEOPLE AWARE OF THE

02:38:56.460 --> 02:38:59.563
RISKS OF VALLEY FEVER? THE IDEA

02:38:59.630 --> 02:39:01.665
IS TO HAVE ADDITIONAL SCREENINGS

02:39:01.732 --> 02:39:05.235
IN AREAS WHERE IT'S HIGHLY KNOWN

02:39:05.302 --> 02:39:07.905
TO BE, BUT NOT ENOUGH SCREENINGS

02:39:07.971 --> 02:39:11.041
ARE HAPPENING AGAIN. IT'S TO

02:39:11.108 --> 02:39:14.678
ENSURE THAT WE CAN BECOME AWARE

02:39:14.745 --> 02:39:16.780
OF THE DISEASE EARLY ON, RATHER

02:39:16.847 --> 02:39:20.384
THAN LATER ON. AS AS I THINK. I

02:39:20.450 --> 02:39:21.952
THINK THAT'S COMMENDABLE. I'LL

02:39:22.019 --> 02:39:22.953
BE SUPPORTING IT. MY FATHER HAD

02:39:23.020 --> 02:39:25.188
VALLEY FEVER PROBABLY 60 YEARS

02:39:25.255 --> 02:39:26.823
AGO. HE WAS A HEAVY SMOKER UNTIL

02:39:26.890 --> 02:39:28.625
THEN, AND THEN HE HAD PART OF

02:39:28.692 --> 02:39:30.627
HIS LUNG REMOVED, BUT HE LIVED

02:39:30.694 --> 02:39:33.397
30 MORE YEARS HEALTHILY. BUT IT

02:39:33.463 --> 02:39:35.966
WAS THE SMOKING THAT DID HIM IN.

02:39:36.033 --> 02:39:39.136
AND SO IT IS AN UNKNOWN. A LOT

02:39:39.202 --> 02:39:40.404
OF PEOPLE DO NOT UNDERSTAND

02:39:40.470 --> 02:39:41.705
VALLEY FEVER AND THEY THINK IT'S

02:39:41.772 --> 02:39:42.806
TUBERCULOSIS OR SOMETHING LIKE

02:39:42.873 --> 02:39:45.275
THAT. SO I COMMEND JUST GREATER

02:39:45.342 --> 02:39:46.944
AWARENESS AND SENSITIVITY TO IT,

02:39:47.010 --> 02:39:49.613
BUT IT CAN BE CURED. THAT'S THE

02:39:49.680 --> 02:39:50.747
IMPORTANT THING. IT CAN BE

02:39:50.814 --> 02:39:52.849
SUCCESSFULLY TREATED. THANK YOU.

02:39:52.916 --> 02:39:55.385
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER

02:39:55.452 --> 02:39:57.888
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS? I ALSO

02:39:57.955 --> 02:39:58.822
APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING

02:39:58.889 --> 02:40:00.524
ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE. FOR SO

02:40:00.590 --> 02:40:02.125
MANY YEARS IT HAS BEEN IGNORED,

02:40:02.192 --> 02:40:03.794
BUT BECAUSE OF FAMILIES STEPPING

02:40:03.860 --> 02:40:05.395
UP AND LEGISLATORS STEPPING UP,

02:40:05.462 --> 02:40:06.997
IT'S NOW AN ISSUE THAT'S ON THE

02:40:07.064 --> 02:40:09.666
FOREFRONT AND I'M GLAD THAT

02:40:09.733 --> 02:40:10.867
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE

02:40:10.934 --> 02:40:11.468
ENCOURAGEMENT FOR MORE

02:40:11.535 --> 02:40:14.004
SCREENINGS. BEFORE WE GET TO

02:40:14.071 --> 02:40:15.672

02:40:15.739 --> 02:40:17.341

I'M HERE TO PRESENT SB 550, A

02:41:38.088 --> 02:41:39.423
BILL THAT ADDRESSES A LONG

02:41:39.489 --> 02:41:40.757
STANDING GAP IN CALIFORNIA'S

02:41:40.824 --> 02:41:42.592
LEGAL EDUCATION SYSTEM BY

02:41:42.659 --> 02:41:44.428
CREATING A PATHWAY FOR PUBLIC

LEGAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS IN SAN

02:41:46.596 --> 02:41:48.031
JOSE. I WANT TO THANK THE

02:41:48.098 --> 02:41:49.466
COMMITTEE AND STAFF FOR THEIR

02:41:49.533 --> 02:41:50.834
THOUGHTFUL WORK ON THIS

02:41:50.901 --> 02:41:53.804
PROPOSAL. WE'VE HAD A LOT OF

02:41:53.870 --> 02:41:57.040
COMMITTEE HELP ALONG THE WAY.

02:41:57.107 --> 02:41:59.009
THIS BILL ESTABLISHES A LEGAL

02:41:59.076 --> 02:42:01.311
EDUCATION PILOT PROGRAM IN

02:42:01.378 --> 02:42:02.245
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE NONPROFIT,

STATE ACCREDITED LAW SCHOOL AND

02:42:04.314 --> 02:42:06.316
SAN JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY. SAN

02:42:06.383 --> 02:42:07.751
JOSE IS THE THIRD LARGEST CITY

02:42:07.818 --> 02:42:09.019
IN CALIFORNIA. AS MOST OF US

02:42:09.086 --> 02:42:10.187
KNOW, THE LARGEST CITY IN THE

02:42:10.253 --> 02:42:12.022
BAY AREA AND ONE OF THE LARGEST

02:42:12.089 --> 02:42:13.623
CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES

02:42:13.690 --> 02:42:14.925
WITHOUT A PUBLIC LAW SCHOOL.

02:42:14.991 --> 02:42:16.259
SANTA CLARA COUNTY IS HOME TO

02:42:16.326 --> 02:42:17.994
NEARLY 2 MILLION RESIDENTS, YET

02:42:18.061 --> 02:42:19.896
THE REGION LACKS AN AFFORDABLE,

02:42:19.963 --> 02:42:21.798
ACCESSIBLE OPTION FOR LEGAL

02:42:21.865 --> 02:42:23.266
EDUCATION. IN SANTA CLARA

02:42:23.333 --> 02:42:25.068
COUNTY, OVER 65% OF THE

POPULATION IDENTIFIES AS ASIAN

02:42:26.603 --> 02:42:28.238
OR LATINO. BOTH GROUPS REMAIN

02:42:28.305 --> 02:42:29.906
SEVERELY UNDERREPRESENTED AMONG

02:42:29.973 --> 02:42:31.241
LICENSED ATTORNEYS. STATEWIDE,

02:42:31.308 --> 02:42:33.243
THE AVERAGE DEBT FOR LAW GRADS

02:42:33.310 --> 02:42:37.481
NOW EXCEEDS $130,000, BASED ON A

02:42:37.547 --> 02:42:39.883
SURVEY OF PRIVATE LAW SCHOOLS.

02:42:39.950 --> 02:42:41.585
2024 STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE

02:42:41.651 --> 02:42:42.886
AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION FOUND

02:42:42.953 --> 02:42:45.922
THAT 67% OF ALL YOUNG LAWYERS,

02:42:45.989 --> 02:42:47.624
INCLUDING THOSE WITH AND WITHOUT

02:42:47.691 --> 02:42:49.326
LOANS, REPORTED FEELING STRESSED

02:42:49.392 --> 02:42:51.194
ABOUT THEIR FINANCES. THIS COST

02:42:51.261 --> 02:42:53.163
BARRIER DRIVES TALENT AWAY FROM

02:42:53.230 --> 02:42:54.865
PUBLIC SERVICE CAREERS AND

02:42:54.931 --> 02:42:56.733

02:42:59.402 --> 02:43:01.338
THE 2024 STUDY FROM EQUAL

02:43:01.404 --> 02:43:03.173
JUSTICE WORKS FOUND THAT 79% OF

02:43:03.240 --> 02:43:04.508
RECENT LAW SCHOOL GRADUATES CITE

02:43:04.574 --> 02:43:06.510
LOW SALARY AS A REASON THEY

02:43:06.576 --> 02:43:08.311
WOULD NOT PURSUE PUBLIC INTEREST

02:43:08.378 --> 02:43:12.082
LAW. IN 2023, ONLY 9.7% OF LAW

02:43:12.149 --> 02:43:12.816
GRADUATES SECURED PUBLIC

02:43:12.883 --> 02:43:15.185
INTEREST JOBS. THIS AMOUNTS TO

02:43:15.252 --> 02:43:20.123
ONLY 3095 POSITIONS. 92% OF LOW

02:43:20.190 --> 02:43:21.958

02:43:30.066 --> 02:43:31.935

AUTHORIZING A PARTNERSHIP

02:43:32.869 --> 02:43:34.704
BETWEEN SAN JOSE STATE AND A

02:43:37.374 --> 02:43:39.643
PILOT PROGRAM CAN HELP CLOSE

02:43:39.709 --> 02:43:42.179
THOSE GAPS. THE BILL WOULD ALLOW

02:43:42.245 --> 02:43:43.647
SAN JOSE STATE AND THE NONPROFIT

02:43:43.713 --> 02:43:44.881

GOVERNING BOARD OF THE NONPROFIT

02:43:54.090 --> 02:43:55.692

02:43:55.759 --> 02:43:58.195
PROGRAM. WITH US TODAY IS MAGNUS

02:43:58.261 --> 02:43:59.462
HERRLEIN, FORMER PRESIDENT OF

02:43:59.529 --> 02:44:01.531
THE SAN JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY

02:44:01.598 --> 02:44:04.201
PRE-LAW SOCIETY. AT THE

02:44:04.267 --> 02:44:05.135
APPROPRIATE TIME, I'D

02:44:05.202 --> 02:44:06.636
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

02:44:06.703 --> 02:44:07.904
THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING, CHAIR,

02:44:07.971 --> 02:44:09.472
AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY

02:44:09.539 --> 02:44:11.308
NAME IS MAGNUS HERRLEIN AND I AM

02:44:11.374 --> 02:44:12.943
A PROUD RECENT GRADUATE OF SAN

02:44:13.009 --> 02:44:15.178
JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY. I'M HERE

02:44:15.245 --> 02:44:16.980
TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB

02:44:17.047 --> 02:44:20.150
550. IN HIGH SCHOOL, I STRUGGLED

02:44:20.217 --> 02:44:21.351
ACADEMICALLY, BUT COMING TO SAN

02:44:21.418 --> 02:44:23.019
JOSE STATE CHANGED EVERYTHING

02:44:23.086 --> 02:44:24.621
FOR ME. DURING MY FRESHMAN YEAR,

02:44:24.688 --> 02:44:26.790
I DECIDED I WANTED TO PURSUE

02:44:26.856 --> 02:44:28.091
LAW. I WORKED HARD EVERY DAY

02:44:28.158 --> 02:44:29.926
TOWARDS THIS GOAL, AND THIS FALL

02:44:29.993 --> 02:44:31.194
I WILL BE ATTENDING A UNIVERSITY

02:44:31.261 --> 02:44:33.096
OF CALIFORNIA LAW SCHOOL. I

02:44:33.163 --> 02:44:35.232
SHARE THIS BECAUSE AT SJSU I'M

02:44:35.298 --> 02:44:37.167
NOT THE EXCEPTION, BUT I'M THE

02:44:37.234 --> 02:44:39.636
NORM. MY STORY IS THE SDSU

02:44:39.703 --> 02:44:40.971
STORY. IT'S A STORY SHARED BY

02:44:41.037 --> 02:44:42.739
THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS AND ALUMNI

02:44:42.806 --> 02:44:44.608
WHO REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF

02:44:44.674 --> 02:44:46.876
CALIFORNIA. NEARLY HALF OF ALL

02:44:46.943 --> 02:44:47.844
SDSU STUDENTS ARE FIRST

02:44:47.911 --> 02:44:49.512
GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS, AND

02:44:49.579 --> 02:44:51.548
MORE THAN 70% IDENTIFY AS

02:44:51.615 --> 02:44:53.383
STUDENTS OF COLOR. THIS IS WHY

02:44:53.450 --> 02:44:56.119
SB 550 IS SO IMPORTANT.

02:44:56.186 --> 02:44:57.220
UNFORTUNATELY, THE LEGAL

02:44:57.287 --> 02:44:58.622
PROFESSION DOES NOT REFLECT THE

02:44:58.688 --> 02:45:00.390
DIVERSITY OF OUR STATE. PEOPLE

02:45:00.457 --> 02:45:02.692
OF COLOR MAKE UP NEARLY 60% OF

02:45:02.759 --> 02:45:04.594
CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION, BUT

02:45:04.661 --> 02:45:06.229
ONLY ABOUT 35% OF LAWYERS IN OUR

02:45:06.296 --> 02:45:08.665
STATE. A LAW SCHOOL AT SAN JOSE

02:45:08.732 --> 02:45:10.233
STATE WOULD HELP ADDRESS THIS

02:45:10.300 --> 02:45:11.668
INEQUITY BY PROVIDING AN

02:45:11.735 --> 02:45:13.069
AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE LEGAL

02:45:13.136 --> 02:45:15.472
EDUCATION. HOWEVER, SB 550 DOES

02:45:15.538 --> 02:45:17.540
SOMETHING ELSE. IT SENDS A VERY

02:45:17.607 --> 02:45:18.775
POWERFUL MESSAGE TO STUDENTS,

02:45:18.842 --> 02:45:21.044
AND IT TELLS THEM THAT THEY CAN

02:45:21.111 --> 02:45:22.545
BE AN ATTORNEY AND THAT THEY

02:45:22.612 --> 02:45:24.014
BELONG IN THIS PROFESSION. JUST

02:45:24.080 --> 02:45:25.348
AS I FOUND MY PLACE AT SAN JOSE

02:45:25.415 --> 02:45:26.883
STATE, I KNOW THAT THIS LAW

02:45:26.950 --> 02:45:28.118
SCHOOL WILL INSPIRE OTHERS WHO

02:45:28.184 --> 02:45:30.053
WILL COME AFTER ME. I'D LIKE TO

02:45:30.120 --> 02:45:31.221
THANK SENATOR CORTEZ FOR HIS

02:45:31.288 --> 02:45:32.722
LEADERSHIP IN THIS, AND ASK YOU

02:45:32.789 --> 02:45:34.424
FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL.

02:45:34.491 --> 02:45:36.192
THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE

02:45:36.259 --> 02:45:41.965
HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB 550? IS

02:45:42.032 --> 02:45:43.133
THERE ANYONE HERE IN OPPOSITION

02:45:43.199 --> 02:45:48.905
TO SB 550? GOOD MORNING. MY NAME

02:45:48.972 --> 02:45:50.974
IS JASON AMEZCUA. I AM THE DEAN

02:45:51.041 --> 02:45:52.075
OF LINCOLN LAW SCHOOL OF SAN

02:45:52.142 --> 02:45:53.977
JOSE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU.

02:45:54.044 --> 02:45:55.812
ANYONE HERE IN OPPOSITION TO SB

02:45:55.879 --> 02:45:58.114
550? BRING IT BACK TO THE

02:45:58.181 --> 02:45:59.683
COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR

02:45:59.749 --> 02:46:01.584
COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE

02:46:01.651 --> 02:46:04.120
MEMBERS, ASSEMBLY MEMBERS OF BR.

02:46:04.187 --> 02:46:08.458
SO. THANK YOU, SENATOR. I JUST

02:46:08.525 --> 02:46:10.327
WANTED TO EXPLAIN WHY I'LL BE

02:46:10.393 --> 02:46:12.762
LAYING OFF THE BILL TODAY. I

02:46:12.829 --> 02:46:15.098
OBVIOUSLY WOULD LOVE TO SEE A

02:46:15.165 --> 02:46:17.534
LAW SCHOOL IN SAN JOSE. I JUST

02:46:17.600 --> 02:46:20.370
THINK THAT THESE KINDS OF

02:46:20.437 --> 02:46:21.871
DECISIONS NEED TO BE DONE IN A

02:46:21.938 --> 02:46:23.740
MORE HOLISTIC WAY, RATHER THAN A

02:46:23.807 --> 02:46:25.275
PIECEMEAL WAY, AND I THINK WE'VE

02:46:25.342 --> 02:46:27.277
GOT A LOT OF DEFICIENCIES IN

02:46:27.344 --> 02:46:29.079
HIGHER EDUCATION NOW IN TERMS

02:46:29.145 --> 02:46:31.147
OF, YOU KNOW, NOT ENOUGH SPOTS

02:46:31.214 --> 02:46:32.315
FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS, NOT ENOUGH

02:46:32.382 --> 02:46:34.150
LAW SCHOOLS, NOT ENOUGH. AND I

02:46:34.217 --> 02:46:36.186
KNOW WE'VE HAVE, INCLUDING SOME

02:46:36.252 --> 02:46:37.854
IN MY OWN DISTRICT WHERE WE'VE

02:46:37.921 --> 02:46:39.155
ACTUALLY HAVE BOTH COMMUNITY

02:46:39.222 --> 02:46:41.157
COLLEGES AND CAL STATE BODIES

02:46:41.224 --> 02:46:42.792
WHO WANT TO EXPAND THEIR

02:46:42.859 --> 02:46:44.194
PROGRAMS BEYOND WHAT WAS

02:46:44.260 --> 02:46:45.195
ENVISIONED IN THE MASTER PLAN

02:46:45.261 --> 02:46:46.396
FOR EDUCATION THAT WAS ADOPTED

02:46:46.463 --> 02:46:49.666
IN 1960. IT'S CLEAR THAT WE SORT

02:46:49.733 --> 02:46:51.267
OF NEED TO REVISIT ALL OF THIS,

02:46:51.334 --> 02:46:52.969
BUT I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE DONE

02:46:53.036 --> 02:46:55.505
IN A WAY THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH

02:46:55.572 --> 02:46:56.339
A LARGER PLANNING PROCESS. AND

02:46:56.406 --> 02:46:57.674
THAT'S THE REASON WHY I'LL BE

02:46:57.741 --> 02:46:59.008
LAYING OFF THE BILL TODAY. THANK

02:46:59.075 --> 02:47:02.045
YOU, ASSEMBLY MEMBER PACHECO. SO

02:47:02.112 --> 02:47:06.049
I HAD I HAD A QUESTION. THIS

02:47:06.116 --> 02:47:09.586
BILL WOULD ESTABLISH A LEGAL

02:47:09.652 --> 02:47:11.454
EDUCATIONAL PILOT PROGRAM. IT

02:47:11.521 --> 02:47:13.656
DOESN'T NECESSARILY I KNOW I

02:47:13.723 --> 02:47:15.892
FROM WHAT I'M READING, THE

02:47:15.959 --> 02:47:18.294
ORIGINAL BILL WAS TO CREATE A

02:47:18.361 --> 02:47:20.597
LAW SCHOOL, AND THIS BILL WOULD

02:47:20.663 --> 02:47:23.099
BE TO CREATE AN EDUCATIONAL

02:47:23.166 --> 02:47:24.734
PILOT PROGRAM. CAN YOU EXPLAIN

02:47:24.801 --> 02:47:26.803
TO ME WHAT THE PILOT PROGRAM

02:47:26.870 --> 02:47:29.038
WOULD ENTAIL? YES. AND THE

02:47:29.105 --> 02:47:32.776
ORIGINAL BILL USED A WORD THAT

02:47:32.842 --> 02:47:34.744
WE ACTUALLY ALMOST IMMEDIATELY

02:47:34.811 --> 02:47:38.515
STARTED TO TRY TO FIND A

02:47:38.581 --> 02:47:39.916
REPLACEMENT FOR, TO BE BE VERY

02:47:39.983 --> 02:47:42.385
CANDID ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW,

02:47:42.452 --> 02:47:43.553
INCLUDING DEALING WITH THE

02:47:43.620 --> 02:47:44.988
SCHOOLS INVOLVED AND SO FORTH,

02:47:45.054 --> 02:47:47.190
WHICH WAS MERGER. AND I THINK,

02:47:47.257 --> 02:47:49.592
YOU KNOW, THE OUTCOME THAT A

02:47:49.659 --> 02:47:51.227
STATUTE WOULD, WOULD HAVE THEN

02:47:51.294 --> 02:47:55.465
WOULD BE. YOU KNOW, ASSUMING THE

02:47:55.532 --> 02:47:57.367
CSU BOARD OF TRUSTEES SIGNED OFF

02:47:57.434 --> 02:48:00.470
AND ALL THE REST OF THE LEGAL

02:48:00.537 --> 02:48:02.405
PROCEDURES HAPPEN, THE SCHOOL

02:48:02.472 --> 02:48:04.140
SOMEHOW WOULD BE MERGED INTO,

02:48:04.207 --> 02:48:05.175
INTO ONE. I MEAN, THAT'S

02:48:05.241 --> 02:48:06.810
BASICALLY RIGHT. THE BASIC LEGAL

02:48:06.876 --> 02:48:08.812
DEFINITION, THIS KEEPS THE TWO

02:48:08.878 --> 02:48:11.948
SCHOOLS SEPARATE. AND THE PILOT

02:48:12.015 --> 02:48:16.753
PROGRAM HAS A SUNSET. THERE'S

02:48:16.820 --> 02:48:18.188
PREVIOUS AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE

02:48:18.254 --> 02:48:20.156
TAKEN WHICH WERE IMPORTANT OVER

02:48:20.223 --> 02:48:21.825
ON THE SENATE SIDE AS JUDICIARY,

02:48:21.891 --> 02:48:23.993
WHICH BASICALLY SAY THAT THE

02:48:24.060 --> 02:48:28.965
SCHOOL NEEDS TO RUN OUT A AN

02:48:29.032 --> 02:48:31.234
UNBROKEN STRING OF FIVE STRAIGHT

02:48:31.301 --> 02:48:33.770
YEARS ACCREDITED BY THE BAR. THE

02:48:33.837 --> 02:48:35.104
SCHOOL'S BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG

02:48:35.171 --> 02:48:36.873
TIME. THE SCHOOL IN SAN JOSE,

02:48:36.940 --> 02:48:38.341
THE ONE STATE ACCREDITED SCHOOL

02:48:38.408 --> 02:48:40.810
THAT THAT EXISTS IN SAN JOSE,

02:48:40.877 --> 02:48:42.245
BACKS RIGHT UP PHYSICALLY TO SAN

02:48:42.312 --> 02:48:43.947
JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY. BUT

02:48:44.013 --> 02:48:46.182
AGAIN, THAT REQUIREMENTS IN

02:48:46.249 --> 02:48:52.088
THERE. SO THE PILOT ESSENTIALLY.

02:48:52.155 --> 02:48:54.557
CAN START SOMEWHERE AROUND YEAR

02:48:54.624 --> 02:48:57.360
SIX. AND THEN THERE'S A PERIOD

02:48:57.427 --> 02:49:01.264
OF JOINT CONFERRING OF DEGREES.

02:49:01.331 --> 02:49:02.999
THEY HAVE TO SIT DOWN AND COME

02:49:03.066 --> 02:49:04.200
UP WITH AN OPERATING AGREEMENT

02:49:04.267 --> 02:49:05.368
OR NONE OF THIS HAPPENS

02:49:05.435 --> 02:49:06.669
BASICALLY. THAT'S ALL, YOU KNOW,

02:49:06.736 --> 02:49:08.571
EMBEDDED HERE AND KIND OF

02:49:08.638 --> 02:49:11.074
UNDERSTOOD. AND THEN THE SUNSET

02:49:11.140 --> 02:49:12.442
COMES AT YEAR 15, MEANING NO

02:49:12.509 --> 02:49:14.244
MATTER WHAT THEY'VE DONE OR NOT

02:49:14.310 --> 02:49:16.145
DONE, YOU KNOW, THE STATUTE

02:49:16.212 --> 02:49:17.780
WOULD JUST ESSENTIALLY RETIRE

02:49:17.847 --> 02:49:20.717
ITSELF. SO IF THE PROGRAM IS

02:49:20.783 --> 02:49:21.751
SUCCESSFUL, THERE'LL BE AN

02:49:21.818 --> 02:49:24.387
OPPORTUNITY TO COME BACK. AND I

02:49:24.454 --> 02:49:25.722
SUPPOSE MAKE ADDITIONAL

02:49:25.788 --> 02:49:27.223
ARGUMENTS AT THAT TIME OR

02:49:27.290 --> 02:49:32.529
EFFORTS TO. YOU KNOW, TO, TO

02:49:32.595 --> 02:49:34.163
MAKE PERMANENT THE, THE, THE

02:49:34.230 --> 02:49:35.131
ARRANGEMENT OF THE RELATIONSHIP,

02:49:35.198 --> 02:49:37.333
TAKE IT OFF PILOT STATUS OR, OR

02:49:37.400 --> 02:49:39.102
MAYBE MODIFY IT BASED ON THE

02:49:39.168 --> 02:49:39.969
LEARNING THAT'S OCCURRED DURING

02:49:40.036 --> 02:49:43.139
THE PILOT. LIKE MOST PILOT

02:49:43.206 --> 02:49:45.475
PROGRAMS THAT WE DO IN THE

02:49:45.542 --> 02:49:46.142
LEGISLATURE, THAT'S THE IDEA, AS

02:49:46.209 --> 02:49:47.410
BEST AS I CAN DESCRIBE IT,

02:49:47.477 --> 02:49:48.411
WITHOUT JUST READING FROM THE

02:49:48.478 --> 02:49:50.246
BILL. THANK YOU. I LIKE THE IDEA

02:49:50.313 --> 02:49:51.948
OF HAVING A PILOT PROGRAM. I

02:49:52.015 --> 02:49:53.816
DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANY

02:49:53.883 --> 02:49:55.318
CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITIES

02:49:55.385 --> 02:49:58.922
THAT OFFER A LAW SCHOOL PROGRAM.

02:49:58.988 --> 02:50:00.823
NO, NO, IT'S ONLY THE UCS FROM

02:50:00.890 --> 02:50:02.992
WHAT I REMEMBER. RIGHT? WHICH IS

02:50:03.059 --> 02:50:05.895
WHICH HAS BEEN BASED VERY

02:50:05.962 --> 02:50:07.931
CLEARLY ON SOMETIMES YOU SEE IS

02:50:07.997 --> 02:50:10.133
HERE DURING THE HAS BEEN

02:50:10.199 --> 02:50:11.000
AVAILABLE DURING THE COMMITTEE

02:50:11.067 --> 02:50:12.135
MEETINGS. I DON'T KNOW IF

02:50:12.201 --> 02:50:13.136
THEY'RE AVAILABLE TODAY, BUT

02:50:13.202 --> 02:50:16.205
THEIR RESPONSE HAS BEEN THAT THE

02:50:16.272 --> 02:50:21.077
1960 MASTER PLAN. 65 YEAR OLD

02:50:21.144 --> 02:50:25.548
MASTER PLAN. REQUIRES THAT ONLY

02:50:25.615 --> 02:50:29.152
YOU SEE WOULD ISSUE JD DEGREES,

02:50:29.218 --> 02:50:32.155
JURIS DOCTORATE DEGREES. THE

02:50:32.221 --> 02:50:34.857
PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THAT AMONG

02:50:34.924 --> 02:50:36.726
AMONG MANY, I SUPPOSE. BUT THE

02:50:36.793 --> 02:50:39.429
MAIN PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THAT IS

02:50:39.495 --> 02:50:40.630
SILICON VALLEY, SANTA CLARA

02:50:40.697 --> 02:50:46.069
COUNTY, SAN JOSE, IN 1960 WAS

02:50:46.135 --> 02:50:48.605
ALMOST PREDOMINANTLY ALMOST ALL

02:50:48.671 --> 02:50:50.773
AGRICULTURAL LAND. THE CITY HAD

02:50:50.840 --> 02:50:52.976
A POPULATION OF 90. WHAT WE NOW

02:50:53.042 --> 02:50:54.177
KNOW AS SILICON VALLEY HAD A

02:50:54.243 --> 02:50:56.312
POPULATION OF 95,000 PEOPLE.

02:50:56.379 --> 02:50:59.382
THAT POPULATION WAS ABSOLUTELY

02:50:59.449 --> 02:51:01.184
MAJORITY EUROPEAN, AMERICAN,

02:51:01.250 --> 02:51:02.919
WHITE. I WAS FOUR YEARS OLD AT

02:51:02.986 --> 02:51:05.488
THE TIME. TO PUT IT IN

02:51:05.555 --> 02:51:06.289
PERSPECTIVE, DATING MYSELF. BUT

02:51:06.356 --> 02:51:08.625
I'M TRYING TO MAKE THE POINT

02:51:08.691 --> 02:51:12.495
HERE. THE IDEA THAT YOU WOULD

02:51:12.562 --> 02:51:15.999
BASE A DECISION, NOT YOU, BUT UC

02:51:16.065 --> 02:51:18.434
OR ANYBODY IN HIGHER EDUCATION

02:51:18.501 --> 02:51:19.836
WOULD BASE A DECISION ON WHETHER

02:51:19.902 --> 02:51:22.905
OR NOT THERE SHOULD BE LAW

02:51:22.972 --> 02:51:24.607
DEGREES FROM A PUBLIC SCHOOL

02:51:24.674 --> 02:51:26.376
CONFERRED IN A IN IN A PLACE

02:51:26.442 --> 02:51:28.544
THAT HAS NOW GROWN TO 2 MILLION

02:51:28.611 --> 02:51:31.581
PEOPLE, WITH THE KIND OF

02:51:31.648 --> 02:51:33.950
DIVERSITY I. I PRESENTED IN MY

02:51:34.017 --> 02:51:37.553
OPENING BASED ON A DOCUMENT THAT

02:51:37.620 --> 02:51:40.823
WAS CREATED JUST BEFORE JOHN F

02:51:40.890 --> 02:51:43.626
KENNEDY BECAME PRESIDENT. IS, I

02:51:43.693 --> 02:51:47.296
THINK, AN ABSURDITY. AND IT'S

02:51:47.363 --> 02:51:49.132
BEEN ONE OF THESE THINGS THAT'S

02:51:49.198 --> 02:51:51.734
BEEN ON SOME BURNER, THE BACK

02:51:51.801 --> 02:51:53.202
BURNER, THE FRONT BURNER, BACK

02:51:53.269 --> 02:51:54.470
TO THE BACK BURNER. WE HEAR IT

02:51:54.537 --> 02:51:56.105
IN THE EDUCATION COMMITTEES ALL

02:51:56.172 --> 02:51:58.007
THE TIME, BUT IT'S GETTING TO

02:51:58.074 --> 02:51:59.008
THE POINT WHERE IT'S REDLINING

02:51:59.075 --> 02:52:01.310
THE COMMUNITY. I MEAN, IT'S ONE

02:52:01.377 --> 02:52:03.012
THING TO SAY WE HAVE A DOCUMENT.

02:52:03.079 --> 02:52:04.180
LET'S STICK WITH IT. IT'S

02:52:04.247 --> 02:52:08.851
SOMETHING ELSE. WHEN WE HAVE.

02:52:08.918 --> 02:52:12.255
FOLKS WHO WHO CAN'T GET A PUBLIC

02:52:12.321 --> 02:52:16.426
LEGAL EDUCATION IN, IN, IN THIS

02:52:16.492 --> 02:52:18.161
PLACE, THAT IS BASICALLY THE

02:52:18.227 --> 02:52:19.896
ECONOMIC ENGINE OF THE COUNTRY,

02:52:19.962 --> 02:52:21.864
IF NOT THE WORLD. CERTAINLY THE

02:52:21.931 --> 02:52:24.801
STATE. I MEAN, SOMETHING'S GOT

02:52:24.867 --> 02:52:26.903
TO GIVE HERE. SO I THAT'S A

02:52:26.969 --> 02:52:28.271
DIFFERENT BILL. IT'S A DIFFERENT

02:52:28.337 --> 02:52:29.872
ISSUE. IT'S A DIFFERENT ACTION.

02:52:29.939 --> 02:52:31.307
RIGHT. THE EDUCATION, THE MASTER

02:52:31.374 --> 02:52:33.776
PLAN. BUT THIS THIS WILL ALLOW A

02:52:33.843 --> 02:52:35.878
PILOT PROGRAM TO, TO MOVE

02:52:35.945 --> 02:52:37.113
FORWARD. I THINK WHILE SOME OF

02:52:37.180 --> 02:52:39.749
THOSE ISSUES ARE SORTED OUT AND

02:52:39.816 --> 02:52:42.385
I, FOR ONE, INTEND TO BE A

02:52:42.452 --> 02:52:44.987
MOVING PARTY IN THIS LEGISLATURE

02:52:45.054 --> 02:52:46.656
TO GET THAT MASTER PLAN DEALT

02:52:46.723 --> 02:52:49.325
WITH, IF I COULD PUT A PIN IN

02:52:49.392 --> 02:52:50.993
THE GOVERNOR'S HAND, I'D, I'D

02:52:51.060 --> 02:52:52.328
I'D HAVE HIM SIGN AN EXECUTIVE

02:52:52.395 --> 02:52:54.063
ORDER RIGHT NOW THAT JUST

02:52:54.130 --> 02:52:56.799
VITIATES THE WHOLE THING. BUT I

02:52:56.866 --> 02:52:57.867
KNOW, I KNOW THE CHAIR WANTS ME

02:52:57.934 --> 02:53:00.069
TO KEEP MY COMMENTS TO THIS, BUT

02:53:00.136 --> 02:53:02.171
I'M ENJOYING THIS. ACTUALLY,

02:53:02.238 --> 02:53:04.073
YES, IT'S RATHER INTERESTING. I

02:53:04.140 --> 02:53:05.441
WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL.

02:53:05.508 --> 02:53:07.677
AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS,

02:53:07.744 --> 02:53:09.512
THIS BILL FORWARD TO BRING ABOUT

02:53:09.579 --> 02:53:10.947
THE PILOT PROGRAM, TO SEE IF

02:53:11.013 --> 02:53:12.448
THIS MAKES SENSE AND IF THIS

02:53:12.515 --> 02:53:14.183
WORKS. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

02:53:14.250 --> 02:53:15.852
THANK YOU, MADAM VICE CHAIR.

02:53:15.918 --> 02:53:17.587
JUST A COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS.

02:53:17.653 --> 02:53:20.623
IS THERE AN EFFORT TO UPDATE THE

02:53:20.690 --> 02:53:21.891
MASTER PLAN FOR HIGHER

02:53:21.958 --> 02:53:23.459
EDUCATION? ARE YOU AWARE OF ONE.

02:53:23.526 --> 02:53:24.293
MAYBE SOMEBODY NEEDS TO

02:53:24.360 --> 02:53:25.194
INTRODUCE THAT BILL. PROBABLY.

02:53:25.261 --> 02:53:27.430
IT'D PROBABLY BE UNFAIR FOR ME

02:53:27.497 --> 02:53:30.767
TO, YOU KNOW, TO COMMENT ON THAT.

02:53:30.833 --> 02:53:34.604
AND, YOU KNOW, I DIRECT YOU VERY

02:53:34.670 --> 02:53:37.373
RESPECTFULLY BACK TO THE

02:53:37.440 --> 02:53:42.478
COMMUNITY COLLEGES. BUT ANYWAY,

02:53:42.545 --> 02:53:44.614
IT I THINK THERE'S, YOU KNOW,

02:53:44.680 --> 02:53:46.949
EVEN EVEN, YOU KNOW, MR. SABER

02:53:47.016 --> 02:53:48.117
WAS TALKING ABOUT SEEING OFF THE

02:53:48.184 --> 02:53:50.319
BILL. I THINK THERE'S JUST A

02:53:50.386 --> 02:53:51.154
GENERAL UNDERSTANDING IN THE

02:53:51.220 --> 02:53:52.088
LEGISLATURE THIS NEEDS TO

02:53:52.155 --> 02:53:53.856
HAPPEN. I'M PROBABLY NOT STATING

02:53:53.923 --> 02:53:56.259
ANYTHING RADICAL HERE TO SAY.

02:53:56.325 --> 02:53:58.294
WELL, I DO THINK IT SHOULD.

02:53:58.361 --> 02:54:00.463
LOOK, I MISS MY COLLEAGUE FROM

02:54:00.530 --> 02:54:02.365
SANTA MONICA. LOOK AT THIS

02:54:02.431 --> 02:54:03.533
HOLISTICALLY BECAUSE IT'S A

02:54:03.599 --> 02:54:05.301
LARGER PROBLEM. AND POPULATION

02:54:05.368 --> 02:54:07.003
HAS GROWN AS WELL AS SHIFTED. SO

02:54:07.069 --> 02:54:09.038
IT'S PROBABLY RELEVANT TO OTHER

02:54:09.105 --> 02:54:11.307
DISCUSSIONS. BUT REGARDING THE

02:54:11.374 --> 02:54:12.341
PARTNERSHIP, I'M GLAD TO SEE

02:54:12.408 --> 02:54:14.076
THAT YOU DID AMEND IT. I WAS

02:54:14.143 --> 02:54:15.211
CONCERNED ABOUT THE

02:54:15.278 --> 02:54:17.113
ACCREDITATION STATUS AND ALSO

02:54:17.180 --> 02:54:19.248
THE PERCENTAGE OF ITS GRADUATES

02:54:19.315 --> 02:54:22.084
OF THE LINCOLN LAW SCHOOL

02:54:22.151 --> 02:54:23.186
SPECIFICALLY HAVE PASSED THE BAR

02:54:23.252 --> 02:54:27.223
EXAM. AND MAYBE PART OF THIS

02:54:27.290 --> 02:54:28.491
RECONSIDERATION DURING THE

02:54:28.558 --> 02:54:30.326
PARTNERSHIP ERA OR PERIOD OF

02:54:30.393 --> 02:54:33.863
TIME TO ENSURE THAT THE PASS

02:54:33.930 --> 02:54:36.866
RATE INCREASES. YEAH, IT'S AN IF

02:54:36.933 --> 02:54:39.635
I MAY, THROUGH THE CHAIR. IT'S

02:54:39.702 --> 02:54:40.102
AN INTERESTING THING.

02:54:40.169 --> 02:54:41.637
ACCREDITATION FOR THESE SCHOOLS

02:54:41.704 --> 02:54:44.473
IS BY THE BAR ITSELF. NOT THAT

02:54:44.540 --> 02:54:45.775
THEY COULDN'T HAVE WASKE

02:54:45.842 --> 02:54:47.910
ACCREDITATION OR SOME OTHER

02:54:47.977 --> 02:54:49.846
ACCREDITATION ENTITIES COME IN

02:54:49.912 --> 02:54:51.247
VOLUNTARILY IF THEY WANTED TO,

02:54:51.314 --> 02:54:53.015
BUT THEY'RE THE BAR THAT'S NOT

02:54:53.082 --> 02:54:55.551
VOLUNTARY. AND IT'S NOT ENTIRELY

02:54:55.618 --> 02:54:58.387
BASED ON BAR PASS RATE, BUT BAR

02:54:58.454 --> 02:54:59.856
PASS RATE IS A DEAL BREAKER.

02:54:59.922 --> 02:55:01.290
AND, YOU KNOW, AFTER THE

02:55:01.357 --> 02:55:03.993
PANDEMIC, SCHOOLS LIKE THE ONE

02:55:04.060 --> 02:55:05.628
WE'RE REFERRING TO HERE HAD A

02:55:05.695 --> 02:55:07.063
TOUGH TIME, YOU KNOW, COMING OUT

02:55:07.129 --> 02:55:09.999
OF THAT PERIOD, THAT LAW IS NOT

02:55:10.066 --> 02:55:12.935
AN EASY COURSE TO TEACH OR LEARN

02:55:13.002 --> 02:55:15.238
IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THEN PASS

02:55:15.304 --> 02:55:16.572
THE BAR, LET ALONE IF YOU'RE

02:55:16.639 --> 02:55:18.307
TRYING TO DO IT REMOTELY. SO,

02:55:18.374 --> 02:55:19.108
YOU KNOW, THOSE WERE

02:55:19.175 --> 02:55:20.710
DIFFICULTIES, BUT THE BILL'S

02:55:20.776 --> 02:55:23.913
BEEN STRAIGHT STATE ACCREDITED

02:55:23.980 --> 02:55:27.617
INITIALLY. GOING BACK, I WANT TO

02:55:27.683 --> 02:55:33.422
SAY TO THE 19 APPROXIMATELY 1993

02:55:33.489 --> 02:55:36.692
94 LOST ITS ACCREDITATION WHEN

02:55:36.759 --> 02:55:38.728
THE BAR PASS RATE WENT DOWN, BAR

02:55:38.794 --> 02:55:42.098
PASS RATE CAME BACK UP, AND THEY

02:55:42.164 --> 02:55:43.699
ACTUALLY JUST CELEBRATED THE

02:55:43.766 --> 02:55:45.534
RENEWED ACCREDITATION OF THE

02:55:45.601 --> 02:55:47.436
SCHOOL ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO. SO

02:55:47.503 --> 02:55:49.672
IT'S GOT UNDER THIS BILL, IT'S

02:55:49.739 --> 02:55:50.306
GOT TO MAINTAIN THAT WITH THE

02:55:50.373 --> 02:55:52.942
STATE BAR THAT LEVEL OR THIS

02:55:53.009 --> 02:55:54.810
BILL JUST ESSENTIALLY DISSOLVES.

02:55:54.877 --> 02:55:57.280
OKAY. VERY GOOD. THANK YOU.

02:55:57.346 --> 02:56:00.483
ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S BAUER-KAHAN.

02:56:00.549 --> 02:56:01.651
WELL, THANK YOU, SENATOR. WHILE

02:56:01.717 --> 02:56:03.152
YOU WERE TALKING, I ACTUALLY DID

02:56:03.219 --> 02:56:05.054
SOME RESEARCH OVER HERE ON BAR

02:56:05.121 --> 02:56:06.589
PASS RATES AND THE COST OF LAW

02:56:06.656 --> 02:56:08.357
SCHOOL. I FOUND FASCINATING. THE

02:56:08.424 --> 02:56:10.026
BAR PASSAGE RATE OF LINCOLN LAW

02:56:10.092 --> 02:56:11.527
SCHOOL IS HIGHER THAN SANTA

02:56:11.594 --> 02:56:12.628
CLARA, AND THE TUITION AT SANTA

02:56:12.695 --> 02:56:14.997
CLARA IS $61,000 A YEAR. AND THE

02:56:15.064 --> 02:56:16.866
TOTAL TUITION IN THREE YEARS AT

02:56:16.933 --> 02:56:19.001
LINCOLN LAW SCHOOL IS $75,000.

02:56:19.068 --> 02:56:21.270
SO IF YOU GO TO LINCOLN LAW

02:56:21.337 --> 02:56:23.372
SCHOOL, YOU SAVE OVER $100,000

02:56:23.439 --> 02:56:25.107
IN TUITION AND YOU HAVE A HIGHER

02:56:25.174 --> 02:56:26.676
CHANCE OF PASSING THE BAR.

02:56:26.742 --> 02:56:28.344
THAT'S A PHENOMENAL COMPARISON.

02:56:28.411 --> 02:56:30.046
AND I USED TO TEACH LAW SCHOOL

02:56:30.112 --> 02:56:31.547
AT SANTA CLARA, SO I'M TAKING MY

02:56:31.614 --> 02:56:35.651
OWN ALMA MATER. BUT BUT, YOU

02:56:35.718 --> 02:56:37.820
KNOW, I THINK THAT ONE OF THE

02:56:37.887 --> 02:56:39.722
THINGS THAT COMPELS ME TO THIS

02:56:39.789 --> 02:56:40.890
BILL IS ACTUALLY THE COST OF

02:56:40.957 --> 02:56:43.526
GOING TO LINCOLN LAW SCHOOL. I

02:56:43.592 --> 02:56:44.226
LOOKED AT UC HASTINGS IS $55,000

02:56:44.293 --> 02:56:47.863
A YEAR, SO OR NOT UC LAW. SORRY.

02:56:47.930 --> 02:56:50.499
THANK YOU. UC LAW IS $55,000 A

02:56:50.566 --> 02:56:52.335
YEAR. AND ONE OF THE REASONS

02:56:52.401 --> 02:56:53.235
THAT I, YOU KNOW, WHEN PEOPLE

02:56:53.302 --> 02:56:55.604
ASK ME, AS A FORMER LAW

02:56:55.671 --> 02:56:56.238
PROFESSOR AND LAWYER, SHOULD I

02:56:56.305 --> 02:56:58.074
GO TO LAW SCHOOL, THINGS HAVE

02:56:58.140 --> 02:56:59.241
REALLY CHANGED AND IT IS VERY

02:56:59.308 --> 02:57:00.076
EXPENSIVE. AND THE AMOUNT OF

02:57:00.142 --> 02:57:01.978
DEBT THAT STUDENTS GO INTO TO

02:57:02.044 --> 02:57:03.713
BECOME LAWYERS MAKES ME TELL

02:57:03.779 --> 02:57:04.413
THEM THEY SHOULD THINK HARD

02:57:04.480 --> 02:57:05.948
ABOUT WHETHER THAT DEGREE IS

02:57:06.015 --> 02:57:06.916
REALLY SOMETHING THEY NEED,

02:57:06.983 --> 02:57:08.484
BECAUSE THE DEBT THAT THEY ARE

02:57:08.551 --> 02:57:10.152
GOING TO INCUR IS SO GREAT. AND

02:57:10.219 --> 02:57:11.520
SO THE FACT THAT POTENTIALLY WE

02:57:11.587 --> 02:57:13.689
COULD HAVE THIS PARTNERSHIP WITH

02:57:13.756 --> 02:57:14.523
A SCHOOL THAT HAS INCREDIBLY LOW

02:57:14.590 --> 02:57:16.258
TUITION COMPARED TO ITS PEERS, I

02:57:16.325 --> 02:57:16.759
THINK IS IMPORTANT, BUT

02:57:16.826 --> 02:57:18.027
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD MAKE

02:57:18.094 --> 02:57:20.029
SURE IS PART OF THE ONGOING DEAL

02:57:20.096 --> 02:57:22.031
IS THAT IF WE DO HAVE THE CSU

02:57:22.098 --> 02:57:22.932
OPPORTUNITY, THAT LIKE THE

02:57:22.999 --> 02:57:23.866
OPPORTUNITIES THAT STATE

02:57:23.933 --> 02:57:25.434
SCHOOLS, PART OF WHAT WE OFFER

02:57:25.501 --> 02:57:27.203
IS A GREAT EDUCATION AT A GREAT

02:57:27.269 --> 02:57:28.904
COST. AND SO I HOPE THAT THAT

02:57:28.971 --> 02:57:31.140
WILL BE PART OF WHAT WE LOOK AT.

02:57:31.207 --> 02:57:33.109
BUT I THINK THAT'S PART OF WHAT

02:57:33.175 --> 02:57:33.876
YOU'RE PUTTING ON THE TABLE

02:57:33.943 --> 02:57:35.344
THROUGH A PARTNERSHIP AT A

02:57:35.411 --> 02:57:36.512
SCHOOL THAT I DIDN'T KNOW MUCH

02:57:36.579 --> 02:57:38.247
ABOUT. BUT ACCORDING TO MY TWO

02:57:38.314 --> 02:57:39.715
MINUTE RESEARCH OVER HERE SEEMS

02:57:39.782 --> 02:57:40.983
TO BE AFFORDABLE AND DOING A

02:57:41.050 --> 02:57:42.251
DECENT JOB. SO THANK YOU AND

02:57:42.318 --> 02:57:44.020
HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL IF IT

02:57:44.086 --> 02:57:45.154
HASN'T BEEN MOVED. SECOND.

02:57:45.221 --> 02:57:46.022
MOTION AND SECOND. WELL, YEAH, I

02:57:46.088 --> 02:57:48.157
THINK YOUR COMMENTS WILL BE A

02:57:48.224 --> 02:57:49.692
GREAT PART OF THE LINCOLN LAW

02:57:49.759 --> 02:57:51.093
SCHOOL'S MARKETING PACKAGE. NOW,

02:57:51.160 --> 02:57:52.294
AS SOMEONE THAT HAS TAUGHT AT

02:57:52.361 --> 02:57:55.231
LINCOLN LAW SCHOOL, I ALSO AGREE

02:57:55.297 --> 02:57:57.066
THAT, I MEAN, LOOK, AT THE END

02:57:57.133 --> 02:57:58.734
OF THE DAY, WHEN THE MASTER PLAN

02:57:58.801 --> 02:57:59.235
WAS CREATED, UC'S WERE

02:57:59.301 --> 02:58:01.137
PRACTICALLY FREE, RIGHT? I MEAN,

02:58:01.203 --> 02:58:03.372
SO NOW TUITIONS RANGE

02:58:03.439 --> 02:58:06.208
ESSENTIALLY FROM ABOUT 61,000 TO

02:58:06.275 --> 02:58:08.344
$74,000 A YEAR FOR LAW SCHOOL AT

02:58:08.411 --> 02:58:09.178
UC. THAT IS NOT FOR EVERYONE.

02:58:09.245 --> 02:58:11.414
THAT IS NOT MAKING ACCESSIBLE

02:58:11.480 --> 02:58:12.314
SCHOOLS LIKE LINCOLN LAW SCHOOL.

02:58:12.381 --> 02:58:13.883
AND THERE ARE OTHERS LIKE THEM

02:58:13.949 --> 02:58:15.618
AROUND THE STATE, CERTAINLY ARE

02:58:15.684 --> 02:58:17.920
REALLY THE ONLY VIABLE OPTION

02:58:17.987 --> 02:58:19.021
FOR WORKING CLASS FOLKS, FOLKS

02:58:19.088 --> 02:58:21.123
THAT ARE RAISING A FAMILY TO GO

02:58:21.190 --> 02:58:22.925
TO LAW SCHOOL. THAT WASN'T THE

02:58:22.992 --> 02:58:24.393
WAY IT WAS BEFORE. IT'S THE WAY

02:58:24.460 --> 02:58:26.328
IT IS NOW. AND WE NEED TO DO

02:58:26.395 --> 02:58:27.930
REACT TO THAT. AS MENTIONED,

02:58:27.997 --> 02:58:29.398
LINCOLN LAW SCHOOL IS ABOUT A

02:58:29.465 --> 02:58:31.567
THIRD OF THE TUITION OF MOST UC

02:58:31.634 --> 02:58:33.702
LAW SCHOOLS, AND CSU'S ARE RIGHT

02:58:33.769 --> 02:58:35.171
NOW, SAN JOSE STATE IS ABOUT

02:58:35.237 --> 02:58:37.373
$8,000 A YEAR FOR TUITION. SO I

02:58:37.440 --> 02:58:39.875
THINK THAT THIS LEGISLATION,

02:58:39.942 --> 02:58:40.943
ESPECIALLY THE THOUGHTFUL MANNER

02:58:41.010 --> 02:58:43.012
OF CREATING A PILOT AND GIVING

02:58:43.079 --> 02:58:45.147
US A CHANCE TO TAKE A LOOK. IS

02:58:45.214 --> 02:58:46.215
THIS A DIRECTION WE WANT TO GO?

02:58:46.282 --> 02:58:48.050
BECAUSE AS MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE

02:58:48.117 --> 02:58:49.618
THE MASTER PLAN TO BE UPDATED,

02:58:49.685 --> 02:58:51.754
WE CAN'T WAIT AROUND FOR THAT.

02:58:51.821 --> 02:58:53.289
IF WE REALLY WANT ACCESS TO A

02:58:53.355 --> 02:58:54.623
LAW DEGREE FOR OUR RESIDENTS IN

02:58:54.690 --> 02:58:56.325
EVERY CORNER OF THIS STATE, LET

02:58:56.392 --> 02:58:58.627
THIS BE THAT PILOT PROGRAM THAT

02:58:58.694 --> 02:58:59.695
ACTUALLY OPENS OUR EYES, GIVES

02:58:59.762 --> 02:59:02.098
US THE INFORMATION TO MOVE MORE

02:59:02.164 --> 02:59:04.667
THOUGHTFULLY, MOVING FORWARD AS

02:59:04.733 --> 02:59:07.169
TO HOW AND THIS ASPECT OF OUR

02:59:07.236 --> 02:59:08.771
HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM, WE CAN

02:59:08.838 --> 02:59:11.874
DO BETTER FOR THE RESIDENTS OF

02:59:11.941 --> 02:59:12.942
CALIFORNIA. I WOULD LIKE TO BE

02:59:13.008 --> 02:59:15.111
ADDED IF OKAY, AS A PRINCIPAL

02:59:15.177 --> 02:59:17.246
COAUTHOR AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO

02:59:17.313 --> 02:59:21.350
CLOSE? THANK YOU. IT WOULD BE

02:59:21.417 --> 02:59:22.118
TEMPTING TO ADD ON BECAUSE OF

02:59:22.184 --> 02:59:25.221
THE ENTHUSIASM IN THE ROBUST

02:59:25.287 --> 02:59:27.490
DISCUSSION, BUT I'LL JUST CLOSE

02:59:27.556 --> 02:59:29.091
BY RESPECTFULLY ASKING FOR YOUR

02:59:29.158 --> 02:59:32.895
VOTE. THANK YOU. MOTIONS DO PASS

02:59:32.962 --> 02:59:33.896

COMMITTEE TAKING THE BATON AND

03:00:44.567 --> 03:00:48.504
HELPING US GET THERE. THIS BILL,

03:00:48.571 --> 03:00:50.506
SB 750, WE CALL IT THE

03:00:50.573 --> 03:00:51.207
CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE AND

03:00:51.273 --> 03:00:53.142
CREDIT ACT. IT WOULD CREATE A

03:00:53.209 --> 03:00:54.810
CREDIT ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM FOR

03:00:54.877 --> 03:00:57.179
THE PRODUCTION OF HOUSING. THERE

03:00:57.246 --> 03:00:59.548
WERE NO MULTIFAMILY HOUSING

03:00:59.615 --> 03:01:02.218
STARTS IN SAN JOSE LAST YEAR. TO

03:01:02.284 --> 03:01:04.253
PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE, FOR THE

03:01:04.320 --> 03:01:05.554
ENTIRE YEAR, EVEN THOUGH THE

03:01:05.621 --> 03:01:07.356
CITY APPROVED EVERY APPLICATION

03:01:07.423 --> 03:01:10.492
THEY SAW, IN ORDER TO

03:01:10.559 --> 03:01:11.493
EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THIS CRISIS,

03:01:11.560 --> 03:01:13.195
THE STATE NEEDS TO MAKE HOUSING

03:01:13.262 --> 03:01:14.430
A MORE ATTRACTIVE INVESTMENT TO

03:01:14.496 --> 03:01:16.365
PRIVATE FINANCE. CREDIT

03:01:16.432 --> 03:01:17.433
ENHANCEMENTS ARE A PROVEN WAY OF

03:01:17.499 --> 03:01:18.934
DOING THAT IN THE PRIVATE

03:01:19.001 --> 03:01:21.203
SECTOR. UNITED WAY OF GREATER

03:01:21.270 --> 03:01:22.504
LOS ANGELES RECENTLY LAUNCHED

03:01:22.571 --> 03:01:23.138
THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING

03:01:23.205 --> 03:01:24.406
INITIATIVE, WHICH UTILIZES THE

03:01:24.473 --> 03:01:25.474
BALANCE SHEETS OF THEIR

03:01:25.541 --> 03:01:27.309
NONPROFIT PARTNERS TO BACK LOANS

03:01:27.376 --> 03:01:28.711
FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS AT THE

03:01:28.777 --> 03:01:30.713
NATIONAL LEVEL. THE FHA HAS

03:01:30.779 --> 03:01:33.749
UTILIZED THIS TOOL FOR DECADES.

03:01:33.816 --> 03:01:35.017
THERE'S ALSO CLEAR PRECEDENT IN

03:01:35.084 --> 03:01:37.453
STATE GOVERNMENT, BUT NOT FOR

03:01:37.519 --> 03:01:39.488
HOUSING, THE HEALTH FACILITY

03:01:39.555 --> 03:01:40.155
CONSTRUCTION LOAN INSURANCE

03:01:40.222 --> 03:01:42.091
PROGRAM HAS EXISTED FOR OVER 50

03:01:42.157 --> 03:01:44.059
YEARS, AND BACKS PRIVATE LOANS

03:01:44.126 --> 03:01:45.227
TO DEVELOPERS THAT ENSURE THE

03:01:45.294 --> 03:01:47.196
FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF HEALTH

03:01:47.263 --> 03:01:49.965
FACILITY PROJECTS. KAFKA, AS WE

03:01:50.032 --> 03:01:51.734
CALL THIS BILL, WOULD SIMILARLY

03:01:51.800 --> 03:01:53.168
PROVIDE A CLEAR PUBLIC BENEFIT

03:01:53.235 --> 03:01:54.637
BY USING THE STATE'S CREDIT TO

03:01:54.703 --> 03:01:55.938
FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF

03:01:56.005 --> 03:01:57.940
HOUSING BY GUARANTEEING LOANS

03:01:58.007 --> 03:02:00.009
AND WRAPPING BONDS. IT WOULD

03:02:00.075 --> 03:02:02.211
HELP UNLOCK MORE FINANCING AT

03:02:02.278 --> 03:02:03.612
FAVORABLE INTEREST RATES, LIKE

03:02:03.679 --> 03:02:05.848
THE HEALTH FACILITY PROGRAM,

03:02:05.914 --> 03:02:08.384
THIS PROGRAM WOULD PAY FOR ITS

03:02:08.450 --> 03:02:09.218
ADMINISTRATION AND DEFAULTS

03:02:09.285 --> 03:02:11.520
THROUGH FINANCING FINANCING FEES

03:02:11.587 --> 03:02:13.956
AT NO COST TO THE GENERAL FUND.

03:02:14.023 --> 03:02:16.158
THE BILL IS CONTINGENT ON ITS

03:02:16.225 --> 03:02:17.760
COMPANION SENATE CONSTITUTIONAL

03:02:17.826 --> 03:02:19.762
AMENDMENT PASSING, AND A BALLOT

03:02:19.828 --> 03:02:21.597
MEASURE AUTHORIZING THE USE OF

03:02:21.664 --> 03:02:22.364
CALIFORNIA'S CREDIT BEING

03:02:22.431 --> 03:02:23.966
APPROVED BY THE PEOPLE. AND I

03:02:24.033 --> 03:02:27.002
THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. I'M

03:02:27.069 --> 03:02:28.070
GUESSING THAT A PROGRAM LIKE

03:02:28.137 --> 03:02:30.272
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN STOOD UP AT

03:02:30.339 --> 03:02:32.007
SOME TIME, PERHAPS LONG AGO,

03:02:32.074 --> 03:02:33.075
GIVEN THE HOUSING CRISIS THAT

03:02:33.142 --> 03:02:35.577
WE'RE FACING. BUT FOR WHATEVER

03:02:35.644 --> 03:02:36.745
REASON, OUR CALIFORNIA

03:02:36.812 --> 03:02:40.015
CONSTITUTION, UNLIKE OTHERS,

03:02:40.082 --> 03:02:41.917
PROHIBITS THE USE OF THE STATE'S

03:02:41.984 --> 03:02:45.020
CREDIT ITSELF. THINK RATING,

03:02:45.087 --> 03:02:47.489
THINK BOND RATING. THINK FULL

03:02:47.556 --> 03:02:50.693
FAITH AND CREDIT FOR HOUSING,

03:02:50.759 --> 03:02:51.927
EVEN THOUGH IT DOES IT FOR

03:02:51.994 --> 03:02:53.662
HEALTH FACILITIES. SO WE'RE

03:02:53.729 --> 03:02:56.432
TRYING TO DEMONSTRATE WHAT THE

03:02:56.498 --> 03:02:57.566
FRAMEWORK LOOKS LIKE WITH THIS

03:02:57.633 --> 03:03:00.102
BILL AND GET IT TO BECOME

03:03:00.169 --> 03:03:02.571
STATUTE, SO THAT WHEN WE GO IN

03:03:02.638 --> 03:03:03.839
TO MODIFY THE CONSTITUTION, IT'S

03:03:03.906 --> 03:03:06.275
CLEAR TO EVERYBODY WHAT WE'RE

03:03:06.342 --> 03:03:09.678
TRYING TO DO. AND THAT SCA IS

03:03:09.745 --> 03:03:11.380
INTENDED TO BE TAKEN UP IN

03:03:11.447 --> 03:03:13.482
JANUARY WITH US HERE TODAY, WE

03:03:13.549 --> 03:03:15.617
HAVE KEVIN CLARK WITH GOOD RIVER

03:03:15.684 --> 03:03:16.652

03:03:16.719 --> 03:03:18.287

PARTNERSHIP. AND AGAIN, AT THE

03:03:20.456 --> 03:03:21.690
APPROPRIATE TIME, I'D

03:03:21.757 --> 03:03:22.324

MORNING, ASSEMBLYMEMBER AND

03:03:32.601 --> 03:03:34.636
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. SB 750

03:03:34.703 --> 03:03:36.772
WOULD REALLY ACTIVATE AND

03:03:36.839 --> 03:03:38.374
POTENTIALLY LOWER THE COST OF

03:03:38.440 --> 03:03:39.975
DEBT FOR THE CONSTRUCTION AND

03:03:40.042 --> 03:03:42.244
ACQUISITION OF HOUSING ACROSS

03:03:42.311 --> 03:03:44.113
CALIFORNIA. MY FIRM WITH GOOD

03:03:44.179 --> 03:03:45.013
RIVER PARTNERS, WE'RE REALLY

03:03:45.080 --> 03:03:47.216
FOCUSED ON EXPANDING THE HOUSING

03:03:47.282 --> 03:03:50.052
STOCK FOR CHILD WELFARE AND

03:03:50.119 --> 03:03:51.587
FOSTER YOUTH YOUTH WHO ARE

03:03:51.653 --> 03:03:53.055
EXITING FOSTER CARE. SO WE'RE

03:03:53.122 --> 03:03:54.890
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO

03:03:54.957 --> 03:03:56.258
BUILD MORE HOUSING FOR THEM. AND

03:03:56.325 --> 03:03:58.260
IT'S DIFFICULT TO GO TO A LENDER

03:03:58.327 --> 03:03:59.561
WHO DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT

03:03:59.628 --> 03:04:02.698
POPULATION AND ASK FOR A LOAN,

03:04:02.765 --> 03:04:04.967
BECAUSE IT'S UNCLEAR TO THEM HOW

03:04:05.033 --> 03:04:07.069
THAT'S GOING TO BE REPAID. AND

03:04:07.136 --> 03:04:08.937
SO A LITTLE BIT OF EXTRA SUPPORT

03:04:09.004 --> 03:04:11.440
WOULD GO A LONG WAY FOR THAT

03:04:11.507 --> 03:04:12.408
POPULATION. THE WORK THAT WE'RE

03:04:12.474 --> 03:04:16.078
DOING. SB 70 WOULD HELP

03:04:16.145 --> 03:04:17.780
DEVELOPERS AS WELL WITH

03:04:17.846 --> 03:04:18.981

03:04:20.582 --> 03:04:22.084
FINANCING ACROSS THE STATE. AND

03:04:22.151 --> 03:04:23.786
AS SENATOR CORTEZ MENTIONED,

03:04:23.852 --> 03:04:26.255
LOAN GUARANTEES AREN'T A NOVEL

03:04:26.321 --> 03:04:27.322
CONCEPT FOR THE STATE. THEY'VE

03:04:27.389 --> 03:04:28.924
BEEN USED IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF

03:04:28.991 --> 03:04:30.526
HEALTHCARE FACILITIES AND

03:04:30.592 --> 03:04:31.960
GROWING AND EXPANDING THE NUMBER

03:04:32.027 --> 03:04:33.929
OF SMALL BUSINESSES HERE IN THE

03:04:33.996 --> 03:04:35.731
STATES, AND THEY'VE BEEN A

03:04:35.798 --> 03:04:36.532
PROVEN AND EFFECTIVE MANNER OF

03:04:36.598 --> 03:04:40.269
DOING SO. SO WE STRONGLY URGE

03:04:40.335 --> 03:04:42.438
YOUR CONSIDERATION FOR SB 750.

03:04:42.504 --> 03:04:44.139
THANKS. THANK YOU. OKAY. MARK

03:04:44.206 --> 03:04:45.207
STIVERS WITH THE CALIFORNIA

03:04:45.274 --> 03:04:46.575
HOUSING PARTNERSHIP, MY

COLLEAGUES WORK ON THE FINANCING

03:04:48.110 --> 03:04:49.545
FOR ABOUT 200 NONPROFIT

03:04:49.611 --> 03:04:51.079
AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS.

03:04:51.146 --> 03:04:52.815
AT ANY ONE POINT IN TIME. THOSE

03:04:52.881 --> 03:04:54.116
DEVELOPMENTS REALLY HAVE THREE

03:04:54.183 --> 03:04:55.284
ELEMENTS IN THEIR FINANCING.

03:04:55.350 --> 03:04:56.552
THEY HAVE A MORTGAGE LOAN THAT

03:04:56.618 --> 03:04:58.420
IS BACKED BY THE RENTS PAID BY

03:04:58.487 --> 03:04:59.354
TENANTS. THEY HAVE LOW INCOME

03:04:59.421 --> 03:05:00.889
HOUSING TAX CREDITS, AND THEN

03:05:00.956 --> 03:05:03.225
THEY HAVE A PUBLIC SUBSIDY THAT

03:05:03.292 --> 03:05:03.892
FILLS THE REMAINING GAP. AND TO

03:05:03.959 --> 03:05:05.060
THE EXTENT THAT THIS BILL CAN

03:05:05.127 --> 03:05:06.862
REDUCE THE INTEREST RATES ON A

03:05:06.929 --> 03:05:08.030
LOAN, WE CAN GET A BIGGER

03:05:08.096 --> 03:05:09.698
PRIVATE LOAN. AND FOR EACH

03:05:09.765 --> 03:05:11.200
DOLLAR MORE THAT WE GET FROM A

03:05:11.266 --> 03:05:12.968
PRIVATE ENTITY, WE NEED ONE LESS

03:05:13.035 --> 03:05:14.970
DOLLAR OF PUBLIC SUBSIDY TO GO

03:05:15.037 --> 03:05:15.737
INTO THOSE DEVELOPMENTS. WE CAN

03:05:15.804 --> 03:05:16.805
STRETCH OUR STATE RESOURCES MUCH

03:05:16.872 --> 03:05:18.173
FURTHER. SO FOR THOSE REASONS,

03:05:18.240 --> 03:05:19.842
WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS

03:05:19.908 --> 03:05:21.210

ADDED AS A COAUTHOR. I KNOW

03:06:19.368 --> 03:06:19.968
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS, SENATOR

03:06:20.035 --> 03:06:21.970
COURTESY, AND THERE HAVE BEEN SO

03:06:22.037 --> 03:06:23.438
MANY PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN

03:06:23.505 --> 03:06:24.740
APPROVED, INCLUDING AFFORDABLE

03:06:24.806 --> 03:06:26.174
HOUSING PROJECTS, PARTICULARLY

03:06:26.241 --> 03:06:28.076
IN MY AREA, THAT HAVE NOT BEEN

03:06:28.143 --> 03:06:29.645
BUILT BECAUSE OF INTEREST RATES,

03:06:29.711 --> 03:06:31.713
MAKING IT UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE. SO

03:06:31.780 --> 03:06:33.549
I THINK THAT THIS BILL GOES

03:06:33.615 --> 03:06:35.017
RIGHT TO THE HEART OF THE

DINNERS AND RESTLESS TODDLERS,

03:10:37.626 --> 03:10:39.094
SO THEY CREATED A BUSY BAG

03:10:39.161 --> 03:10:40.061
FILLED WITH STEM TOYS,

03:10:40.128 --> 03:10:41.930

BUSINESSES START WITH A MISSION

03:11:04.686 --> 03:11:06.421
DRIVEN LENDER, LIKE A CDFI THAT

03:11:27.175 --> 03:11:28.276
ABLE TO REFINANCE WITH ANOTHER

CAMEO MEMBER, A CDFI THAT

03:11:30.245 --> 03:11:33.315
REDUCED HIS PAYMENTS BY 85%.

03:11:33.381 --> 03:11:34.583
UNFORTUNATELY, NOT ALL SMALL

03:11:34.649 --> 03:11:36.017

BEHALF OF THE REVENUE BASED

03:14:03.498 --> 03:14:04.199
FINANCE COALITION. AND WE ARE

03:14:04.265 --> 03:14:06.067
CHIPPING AWAY AT THIS A BIT AT A

03:14:06.134 --> 03:14:07.535
TIME. WE'RE GETTING THERE

03:14:07.602 --> 03:14:08.236
BECAUSE WE'VE WE REALLY

03:14:08.303 --> 03:14:09.270
APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

03:14:09.337 --> 03:14:11.473
WORK WITH SENATOR GRAYSON ON

03:14:11.539 --> 03:14:12.941
362, BUT WE CONTINUE TO TAKE

03:14:13.008 --> 03:14:14.342
EXCEPTION WITH ONE SMALL AREA OF

03:14:14.409 --> 03:14:15.844
THE BILL AND IT, WHICH IS HOW

03:14:15.910 --> 03:14:17.379
YOU ADDRESS COMMUNICATION WITH

03:14:17.445 --> 03:14:19.014
RESPECT TO CLIENTS. AS DRAFTED,

03:14:19.080 --> 03:14:20.982
THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE AN APRIL

03:14:21.049 --> 03:14:23.952
DISCLOSURE AS PART OF IN

03:14:24.019 --> 03:14:25.120
CONNECTION WITH ANY IN

03:14:25.186 --> 03:14:26.521
CONNECTION WITH ANY

03:14:26.588 --> 03:14:27.922
COMMUNICATION, WHICH IS A VERY

03:14:27.989 --> 03:14:31.259
BROAD STATUTE STANDARD AND IN

03:14:31.326 --> 03:14:32.994
CONFLICT WITH EXISTING

03:14:33.061 --> 03:14:35.530
CALIFORNIA LAW WITH RESPECT TO

03:14:35.597 --> 03:14:37.399
HOW YOU WHEN AN APR DISCLOSURE

03:14:37.465 --> 03:14:39.134
IS REQUIRED. CURRENT LAW

03:14:39.200 --> 03:14:41.202
REQUIRES THAT AT THE TIME OF

03:14:41.269 --> 03:14:43.738
EXTENDING A SPECIFIC COMMERCIAL

03:14:43.805 --> 03:14:44.906
FINANCE OFFER, WHICH MEANS A

03:14:44.973 --> 03:14:46.641
WRITTEN COMMUNICATION THAT

03:14:46.708 --> 03:14:48.209
INCLUDES A RATE, PRICE AND COST

03:14:48.276 --> 03:14:51.413
OF FINANCING. SO A SPECIFIC

03:14:51.479 --> 03:14:52.147
COMMERCIAL OFFERING MEANS A

03:14:52.213 --> 03:14:54.582
WRITTEN COMMUNICATION. SB 362

03:14:54.649 --> 03:14:56.351
WOULD REQUIRE AN APR DISCLOSURE

03:14:56.418 --> 03:14:58.286
DURING ANY COMMUNICATION, WHICH

03:14:58.353 --> 03:15:00.121
CAN INCLUDE A PHONE CALL, AND

03:15:00.188 --> 03:15:01.956
THEN IT WOULD BE HARD TO PROVIDE

03:15:02.023 --> 03:15:03.892
AFTER THE FACT THAT YOU ACTUALLY

03:15:03.958 --> 03:15:05.293
DID THAT. BECAUSE IN CALIFORNIA,

03:15:05.360 --> 03:15:06.394
OF COURSE, WE KNOW WE HAVE TWO

03:15:06.461 --> 03:15:07.962
PARTY CONSENT. AND IF YOU DIDN'T

03:15:08.029 --> 03:15:09.330
GET THAT, THAT THAT TAPE, YOU

03:15:09.397 --> 03:15:11.299
COULDN'T PROVE THAT YOU HAD MADE

03:15:11.366 --> 03:15:12.200
THAT DISCLOSURE. ADDITIONALLY

03:15:12.267 --> 03:15:15.603
WOULD BE IT'D BE IT'D BE

03:15:15.670 --> 03:15:16.838
DIFFICULT IF YOU WERE MAKING

03:15:16.905 --> 03:15:18.006
THAT COMMUNICATION AS PART OF

03:15:18.073 --> 03:15:19.908
THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS AND WANT

03:15:19.974 --> 03:15:21.342
TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE

03:15:21.409 --> 03:15:22.010
COMMUNICATING WITH THEM.

03:15:22.077 --> 03:15:23.678
WOULDN'T DEEM THAT COMMUNICATION

03:15:23.745 --> 03:15:25.980
THAT REQUIRED THE DISCLOSURE. SO

03:15:26.047 --> 03:15:27.515
WE REALLY JUST RECOMMEND

03:15:27.582 --> 03:15:28.850
STRIKING THE VERY BROAD LANGUAGE

03:15:28.917 --> 03:15:30.919
THAT SAYS IN CONNECTION WITH ANY

03:15:30.985 --> 03:15:31.753
COMMUNICATIONS, WE CERTAINLY

03:15:31.820 --> 03:15:33.054
BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BE GIVEN

03:15:33.121 --> 03:15:35.457
AN APR DISCLOSURE WHEN THE AT

03:15:35.523 --> 03:15:37.725
THE TIME THAT AN OFFER IS MADE.

03:15:37.792 --> 03:15:39.727
BUT THE VERY BROAD LANGUAGE OF

03:15:39.794 --> 03:15:41.096
DURING ANY COMMUNICATIONS IS

03:15:41.162 --> 03:15:45.166
JUST DIFFICULT. THAT'S THANK YOU

03:15:45.233 --> 03:15:47.235
SO MUCH. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE

03:15:47.302 --> 03:15:50.105
HERE IN OPPOSITION TO SB 362?

03:15:50.171 --> 03:15:51.106
ALL RIGHT. WE'LL BRING IT BACK

03:15:51.172 --> 03:15:54.309
TO YOU. WE DO HAVE A MOTION ON

03:15:54.375 --> 03:15:55.310
THE TABLE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS

03:15:55.376 --> 03:15:56.211
OR COMMENTS? SENATOR GRAYSON,

03:15:56.277 --> 03:15:58.079
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS

03:15:58.146 --> 03:15:59.147
FORWARD. WOULD YOU LIKE TO

03:15:59.214 --> 03:16:00.315
CLOSE? YES. THE AMENDMENTS WE

03:16:00.381 --> 03:16:01.850
WORKED REALLY HARD WITH ASSEMBLY

03:16:01.916 --> 03:16:04.152
BANKING COMMITTEE TO MAKE SOME

03:16:04.219 --> 03:16:05.220
MEANINGFUL IMPROVEMENTS TO THE

03:16:05.286 --> 03:16:07.722
BILL. THE AMENDMENTS PROVIDE

03:16:07.789 --> 03:16:08.456
FLEXIBILITY TO THE INDUSTRY

03:16:08.523 --> 03:16:09.524
WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE

03:16:09.591 --> 03:16:11.326
POSITION OF THE SMALL BUSINESS

03:16:11.392 --> 03:16:12.727
OWNERS. AND I DO BELIEVE THE

03:16:12.794 --> 03:16:14.295
AMENDMENTS ONLY WENT INTO PRINT

03:16:14.362 --> 03:16:16.030
LAST WEEK. I DO UNDERSTAND SOME

03:16:16.097 --> 03:16:17.031
FOLKS ARE WANTING SOME MORE

03:16:17.098 --> 03:16:18.933
CLARITY ON THAT. HOWEVER, I DO

03:16:19.000 --> 03:16:20.301
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH FOLKS EVEN

03:16:20.368 --> 03:16:21.936
THROUGH THE RECESS. WE'LL GET

03:16:22.003 --> 03:16:23.271
THERE. WE'LL LAND IT. AND WITH

03:16:23.338 --> 03:16:25.473
THAT, I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A

03:16:25.540 --> 03:16:26.374

YOU, MR. CHAIR. AND MEMBERS. SB

03:18:15.516 --> 03:18:17.318
346 WILL EMPOWER LOCAL

03:18:17.385 --> 03:18:19.120
GOVERNMENTS TO COLLECT THE

03:18:19.187 --> 03:18:21.322
CORRECT AMOUNT OF TRANSIENT

03:18:21.389 --> 03:18:23.091
OCCUPANCY TAXES, BETTER KNOWN AS

03:18:23.157 --> 03:18:24.626
TOT, AND BETTER ENFORCE SHORT

03:18:24.692 --> 03:18:27.028
TERM RENTAL ORDINANCES. OVER THE

03:18:27.095 --> 03:18:28.529
PAST SEVERAL YEARS, SHORT TERM

03:18:28.596 --> 03:18:32.900
RENTAL PLATFORMS LIKE VRBO AND

03:18:32.967 --> 03:18:34.969
AIRBNB HAVE GROWN RAPIDLY IN

03:18:35.036 --> 03:18:36.571
CALIFORNIA. IT HAS LED TO TWO

03:18:36.638 --> 03:18:38.606
PROBLEMS ONE, CHALLENGES IN THE

03:18:38.673 --> 03:18:40.441
COLLECTION OF TRANSIENT

03:18:40.508 --> 03:18:41.909
OCCUPANCY TAXES AND TWO

03:18:41.976 --> 03:18:43.578
UNLICENSED OPERATORS. THE FIRST

03:18:43.645 --> 03:18:45.513
PROBLEM IS THE COLLECTION OR THE

03:18:45.580 --> 03:18:47.949
LACK OF COLLECTION OF THE TOT.

03:18:48.016 --> 03:18:50.084
EVERY JURISDICTION IN CALIFORNIA

03:18:50.151 --> 03:18:51.853
REQUIRES SHORT TERM RENTAL HOSTS

03:18:51.919 --> 03:18:54.022
TO GET A LOCAL BUSINESS LICENSE

03:18:54.088 --> 03:18:55.690
WHERE THEY SHARE SHARE THEIR

03:18:55.757 --> 03:18:57.325
ADDRESS SO THAT LOCAL

03:18:57.392 --> 03:18:59.427
GOVERNMENTS KNOW WHERE THEY ARE,

03:18:59.494 --> 03:19:01.229
WHICH IS KEY FOR TAX COLLECTION

03:19:01.296 --> 03:19:03.831
AND ORDINANCE ENFORCEMENT. BUT

03:19:03.898 --> 03:19:05.566
WHEN HOSTS SIGN UP TO LIST A

03:19:05.633 --> 03:19:09.537
PROPERTY ON AIRBNB OR VRBO OR A

03:19:09.604 --> 03:19:11.639
SIMILAR PLATFORM, THERE'S NO WAY

03:19:11.706 --> 03:19:13.441
FOR THEM TO KNOW THIS. THERE'S

03:19:13.508 --> 03:19:15.043
NO DISCLAIMER OR BOX ASKING FOR

03:19:15.109 --> 03:19:17.578
A LICENSE NUMBER. AND WHEN LOCAL

03:19:17.645 --> 03:19:18.913
GOVERNMENTS REQUEST THE

03:19:18.980 --> 03:19:20.715
ADDRESSES OF SHORT TERM RENTAL

03:19:20.782 --> 03:19:22.150
PROPERTIES FROM THE PLATFORMS,

03:19:22.216 --> 03:19:24.052
THEY ARE REFUSED. INSTEAD, THE

03:19:24.118 --> 03:19:25.520
SHORT TERM RENTAL PLATFORMS

03:19:25.586 --> 03:19:27.889
OFFER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

03:19:27.955 --> 03:19:29.390
VOLUNTARY COLLECTION AGREEMENT

03:19:29.457 --> 03:19:31.826
THAT FORCED THEM TO WAIVE AUDIT

03:19:31.893 --> 03:19:34.329
ACCESS TO CRITICAL INFORMATION,

03:19:34.395 --> 03:19:36.097
INCLUDING PROPERTY ADDRESSES.

03:19:36.164 --> 03:19:37.965
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE LEFT

03:19:38.032 --> 03:19:39.367
COMPLETELY IN THE DARK ABOUT

03:19:39.434 --> 03:19:40.535
WHETHER THE AMOUNT OF TAX

03:19:40.601 --> 03:19:42.937
DOLLARS THEY ARE RECEIVING IS

03:19:43.004 --> 03:19:45.973
CORRECT. THIS BILL FIXES THIS BY

03:19:46.040 --> 03:19:47.375
REQUIRING SHORT TERM RENTAL

03:19:47.442 --> 03:19:48.476
PLATFORMS TO PROVIDE LOCAL

03:19:48.543 --> 03:19:49.811
GOVERNMENTS WITH THE ADDRESS OF

03:19:49.877 --> 03:19:52.013
EACH PROPERTY, TO ENSURE LOCAL

03:19:52.080 --> 03:19:54.782
AGENCIES CAN ACCURATELY ASSESS

03:19:54.849 --> 03:19:55.983
AND COLLECT THE CORRECT AMOUNT

03:19:56.050 --> 03:19:58.019
OF T.O.T. THE SECOND CHALLENGE

03:19:58.086 --> 03:19:59.387
IN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM FOR SHORT

03:19:59.454 --> 03:20:02.123
TERM RENTALS IS UNLICENSED

03:20:02.190 --> 03:20:04.258
OPERATORS THAT RESULT FROM THESE

03:20:04.325 --> 03:20:06.394
PRACTICES. ESTIMATES SHOW ABOUT

03:20:06.461 --> 03:20:08.062
72% OF SHORT TERM RENTALS IN

03:20:08.129 --> 03:20:10.031
L.A. COUNTY ARE OPERATING

03:20:10.098 --> 03:20:13.668
WITHOUT BUSINESS LICENSES, OR

03:20:13.735 --> 03:20:15.503
32,000 PROPERTIES. THIS MEANS

03:20:15.570 --> 03:20:17.238
THAT WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE

03:20:17.305 --> 03:20:18.673
PAYING TAXES OR NOT, EVEN AS

03:20:18.740 --> 03:20:20.174
THEY TAKE THOUSANDS OF

03:20:20.241 --> 03:20:21.576
PROPERTIES FROM LONG TERM

03:20:21.642 --> 03:20:23.778
HOUSING STOCK AND RAISE RENTS.

03:20:23.845 --> 03:20:25.246
WITH FEDERAL CUTS TAKING PLACE,

03:20:25.313 --> 03:20:26.948
OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL BE

03:20:27.014 --> 03:20:28.950
SHORT ON RESOURCES THAN EVER.

03:20:29.016 --> 03:20:30.485
THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE TO USE

03:20:30.551 --> 03:20:32.787
THEIR STAFF TIME AND TAX DOLLARS

03:20:32.854 --> 03:20:35.923
ON LEGAL FEES, OR EVEN ON HIRING

03:20:35.990 --> 03:20:39.127
ONLINE DATA MINING COMPANIES IN

03:20:39.193 --> 03:20:40.695
ORDER TO GET THE INFORMATION

03:20:40.762 --> 03:20:42.897
THEY ARE ALREADY ENTITLED TO

03:20:42.964 --> 03:20:44.599
GET. LET'S GIVE THEM THE TOOLS

03:20:44.665 --> 03:20:47.335
TO DO THEIR JOBS AND ENFORCE THE

03:20:47.402 --> 03:20:49.404
ORDINANCES. TODAY I HAVE WITH ME

03:20:49.470 --> 03:20:50.738
TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THIS

03:20:50.805 --> 03:20:52.940
BILL, KAREN LANG WITH THE

03:20:53.007 --> 03:20:53.975
CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY

03:20:54.041 --> 03:20:55.710
TREASURERS AND TAX COLLECTORS,

03:20:55.777 --> 03:20:57.578
AND JOHN DE CRISTINA, ON BEHALF

03:20:57.645 --> 03:20:59.046
OF THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA

03:20:59.113 --> 03:21:00.581
CITIES. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR.

03:21:00.648 --> 03:21:01.749
THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING, MR.

03:21:01.816 --> 03:21:03.317
CHAIR AND MEMBERS. KAREN LANG,

03:21:03.384 --> 03:21:04.652
ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA

03:21:04.719 --> 03:21:05.720
ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY TREASURERS

03:21:05.787 --> 03:21:06.821
AND TAX COLLECTORS, WE ARE

03:21:06.888 --> 03:21:08.356
PLEASED TO BE CO-SPONSOR AND

03:21:08.423 --> 03:21:09.357
THANK THE SENATOR FOR CARRYING

03:21:09.424 --> 03:21:11.225
THIS BILL FOR US. STATE STATUTE

03:21:11.292 --> 03:21:12.627
IS CLEAR. WE DO HAVE THE

03:21:12.693 --> 03:21:14.395
AUTHORITY TO AUDIT SHORT TERM

03:21:14.462 --> 03:21:15.897
RENTALS, INCLUDING HOTELS,

03:21:15.963 --> 03:21:17.432
MOTELS, BED AND BREAKFAST AND

03:21:17.498 --> 03:21:18.733
CAMPGROUNDS. BUT WHAT WE DON'T

03:21:18.800 --> 03:21:20.601
HAVE IS THE ADDRESS. IN ORDER TO

03:21:20.668 --> 03:21:23.538
DO THAT. NORMALLY WHEN A HOTEL

03:21:23.604 --> 03:21:24.939
OR A BED AND BREAKFAST OPENS,

03:21:25.006 --> 03:21:26.407
THEY WILL GO TO THE LOCAL

03:21:26.474 --> 03:21:27.508
GOVERNMENT, THE CITY OR THE

03:21:27.575 --> 03:21:29.177
COUNTY. THEY WILL ISSUE THE

03:21:29.243 --> 03:21:30.344
BUSINESS LICENSE AND THEY WILL

03:21:30.411 --> 03:21:31.746
ALSO ISSUE THE TRANSIT OCCUPANCY

03:21:31.813 --> 03:21:33.881
TAX COLLECTION CERTIFICATE.

03:21:33.948 --> 03:21:35.082
NORMAL BRICK AND MORTAR HOTELS

03:21:35.149 --> 03:21:37.051
AND MOTELS DO THIS.

03:21:37.118 --> 03:21:38.653
UNFORTUNATELY, WHEN HOSTS SIGN

03:21:38.719 --> 03:21:40.955
UP FOR AIRBNB OR VRBO, THERE IS

03:21:41.022 --> 03:21:43.858
NO NATURAL TOUCH POINT TO CHECK

03:21:43.925 --> 03:21:45.193
IN WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO

03:21:45.259 --> 03:21:46.461
SAY THAT THIS IS WHAT'S

03:21:46.527 --> 03:21:47.128
HAPPENING. THERE'S NO

03:21:47.195 --> 03:21:48.763
REQUIREMENT ON THE PLATFORMS TO

03:21:48.830 --> 03:21:50.398
ENSURE THAT THAT EXISTS FIRST,

03:21:50.465 --> 03:21:51.999
AND THERE'S NO PLACE FOR LOCAL

03:21:52.066 --> 03:21:53.167
GOVERNMENT TO KNOW THAT THESE

03:21:53.234 --> 03:21:55.636
PROPERTIES ARE ENROLLING ONLINE.

03:21:55.703 --> 03:21:57.004
UNFORTUNATELY, THE PLATFORMS

03:21:57.071 --> 03:21:58.906
DON'T WANT TO BE THE POLICING

03:21:58.973 --> 03:22:00.475
AUTHORITY ON THE WAY IN, BUT THE

03:22:00.541 --> 03:22:02.743
ONLY WAY WE CAN ENFORCE OUR

03:22:02.810 --> 03:22:04.512
LOCAL ORDINANCES IS BY KNOWING

03:22:04.579 --> 03:22:06.581
THE LOCATIONS OF THESE

03:22:06.647 --> 03:22:08.850
PROPERTIES, WHICH TO THIS POINT

03:22:08.916 --> 03:22:11.052
REQUIRES US GOING TO COURT TO

03:22:11.118 --> 03:22:14.088
DEFEND OUR ORDINANCES. AND SO

03:22:14.155 --> 03:22:16.057
THE BILL WILL HELP PROVIDE THAT

03:22:16.123 --> 03:22:17.458
INFORMATION ON A QUARTERLY

03:22:17.525 --> 03:22:19.961
BASIS. SECONDLY, SOME COUNTY TAX

03:22:20.027 --> 03:22:21.529
COLLECTORS DO HAVE THESE

03:22:21.596 --> 03:22:22.497
VOLUNTARY COLLECTION AGREEMENTS

03:22:22.563 --> 03:22:24.098
WHERE THE PLATFORMS WILL COLLECT

03:22:24.165 --> 03:22:26.734
THE TOT, BUT THE AGREEMENTS

03:22:26.801 --> 03:22:27.902
THEMSELVES, WHICH ARE INCLUDED

03:22:27.969 --> 03:22:29.437
IN THE LETTERS THAT WE'VE SHARED

03:22:29.504 --> 03:22:31.839
WITH THE COMMITTEE, PROHIBIT

03:22:31.906 --> 03:22:34.008
ACCESS TO THE ADDRESS OF THE

03:22:34.075 --> 03:22:34.575
PROPERTIES THEMSELVES. SO WE

03:22:34.642 --> 03:22:36.677
HAVE NO IDEA IF THE AMOUNT THAT

03:22:36.744 --> 03:22:38.779
WE'RE RECEIVING, WHICH IS

03:22:38.846 --> 03:22:39.881
ANONYMIZED, IS ACTUALLY THE

03:22:39.947 --> 03:22:41.482
CORRECT AMOUNT AND EVEN GOING TO

03:22:41.549 --> 03:22:43.117
THE CORRECT JURISDICTION. NEVADA

03:22:43.184 --> 03:22:44.819
AND PLACER ROUTINELY HAVE

03:22:44.886 --> 03:22:46.621
PROBLEMS IN THE TAHOE AREA WHERE

03:22:46.687 --> 03:22:47.989
MONEY IS SENT TO THE WRONG

03:22:48.055 --> 03:22:49.824
COUNTY, AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT

03:22:49.891 --> 03:22:51.292
TO UNWIND THAT ONCE THE MONEY

03:22:51.359 --> 03:22:52.727
HAS BEEN SET. SO THE ADDRESS IS

03:22:52.793 --> 03:22:54.662
CRITICAL FOR THIS POINT. AND AS

03:22:54.729 --> 03:22:55.863
WE HEAD INTO THIS HEARING, ONE

03:22:55.930 --> 03:22:57.231
OF THE THINGS I KNOW YOU'VE

03:22:57.298 --> 03:22:59.233
HEARD A LOT ABOUT IS REQUESTING

03:22:59.300 --> 03:23:00.968
AN AMENDMENT TO PUT IN AN

03:23:01.035 --> 03:23:02.069
ADMINISTRATIVE SUBPOENA INTO THE

03:23:02.136 --> 03:23:05.306
BILL. THAT MAY BE TRUE FOR SOME

03:23:05.373 --> 03:23:07.041
CHARTER CITIES. WHEN I ASKED MY

03:23:07.108 --> 03:23:08.576
58 COUNTY TREASURER TAX

03:23:08.643 --> 03:23:10.011
COLLECTORS, NOT ONE OF THEM HAS

03:23:10.077 --> 03:23:11.112
EVER ISSUED ONE. THERE'S A

03:23:11.178 --> 03:23:12.079
QUESTION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT

03:23:12.146 --> 03:23:13.981
THEY EVEN HAVE THE LEGAL

03:23:14.048 --> 03:23:15.716
AUTHORITY TO DO IT. AND EVEN IF

03:23:15.783 --> 03:23:16.951
THEY DID, THEY'D HAVE TO GO

03:23:17.018 --> 03:23:18.152
THROUGH THEIR COUNTY COUNCIL

03:23:18.219 --> 03:23:20.788
EVERY QUARTER TO GET IT. I HAVE

03:23:20.855 --> 03:23:21.422
MORE, BUT I THINK YOU ALL HAVE

03:23:21.489 --> 03:23:23.291
GOTTEN THE GIST OF WHAT THIS

03:23:23.357 --> 03:23:24.325
BILL IS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. WE

03:23:24.392 --> 03:23:25.993
DO HAVE LOCAL LAND USE

03:23:26.060 --> 03:23:27.161
AUTHORITY. WE ARE THE ONES WHO

03:23:27.228 --> 03:23:29.063
ISSUE THE BUSINESS LICENSES AND

03:23:29.130 --> 03:23:30.131
WE COLLECT TOT. THERE ARE

03:23:30.197 --> 03:23:30.865
UNDOUBTEDLY MILLIONS AND

03:23:30.932 --> 03:23:31.732
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS GOING

03:23:31.799 --> 03:23:32.333
UNCOLLECTED AND KNOWING WHAT

03:23:32.400 --> 03:23:34.368
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE FACING

03:23:34.435 --> 03:23:35.403
WITH CUTS FROM THE FEDERAL

03:23:35.469 --> 03:23:36.270
LEVEL, EVERY PENNY THAT'S

03:23:36.337 --> 03:23:38.072
ALREADY Dð WE REALLY WANT TO BE

03:23:38.139 --> 03:23:39.840
ABLE TO COLLECT. AND WE'RE

03:23:39.907 --> 03:23:40.908
ASKING FOR YOUR VOTE TODAY.

03:23:40.975 --> 03:23:41.809
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. MISTER

03:23:41.876 --> 03:23:43.444
CHAIR. COMMITTEE. THANK YOU. MY

03:23:43.511 --> 03:23:44.278
NAME IS JOHN DICHRISTINA. I'M

03:23:44.345 --> 03:23:45.313
SENIOR COUNSEL WITH COLANTUONO

03:23:45.379 --> 03:23:46.681
HIGHSMITH AND WHATLEY. WE'RE A

03:23:46.747 --> 03:23:48.249
MUNICIPAL LAW FIRM WITH A FOCUS

03:23:48.316 --> 03:23:50.051
ON MUNICIPAL FINANCE ISSUES. AND

03:23:50.117 --> 03:23:52.253
I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE LEAGUE

03:23:52.320 --> 03:23:53.087
OF CALIFORNIA CITIES. I'D LIKE

03:23:53.154 --> 03:23:55.356
TO FOCUS MY BRIEF REMARKS ON ON

03:23:55.423 --> 03:23:56.524
JUST TWO ITEMS FROM THE ANALYSIS

03:23:56.591 --> 03:23:57.992
THAT WAS PRESENTED TO YOU FOR

03:23:58.059 --> 03:24:00.027
THIS BILL. AS FOR ITS THE LEGAL

03:24:00.094 --> 03:24:01.896
QUESTIONS ABOUT IT, THE FIRST IS

03:24:01.963 --> 03:24:03.130
WHETHER THE BILL IS NEEDED AT

03:24:03.197 --> 03:24:04.632
ALL. RIGHT. IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED

03:24:04.699 --> 03:24:06.734
THAT THIS IS SIMPLY DECLARATORY

03:24:06.801 --> 03:24:08.202
OF EXISTING LAW OF CITIES,

03:24:08.269 --> 03:24:10.805
CURRENT AUTHORITIES, EVEN IF

03:24:10.871 --> 03:24:13.007
THAT'S TRUE. AND I'M NOT SURE IT

03:24:13.074 --> 03:24:14.442
IS IF SINCE IT'S GETTING SUCH

03:24:14.508 --> 03:24:16.711
STRONG OPPOSITION. BUT EVEN IF

03:24:16.777 --> 03:24:18.412
IT IS DECLARATORY OF EXISTING

03:24:18.479 --> 03:24:19.814
LAW, I BELIEVE EVERYBODY AROUND

03:24:19.880 --> 03:24:22.416
THIS TABLE HAS A JD. THERE'S

03:24:22.483 --> 03:24:26.287
VALUE IN THAT. AND IN THIS CASE,

03:24:26.354 --> 03:24:28.389
FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO HAVE A

03:24:28.456 --> 03:24:31.392
STATEWIDE POSITION ON WHAT

03:24:31.459 --> 03:24:32.860
INFORMATION CITIES CAN ROUTINELY

03:24:32.927 --> 03:24:34.629
REQUEST FROM SHORT TERM RENTAL

03:24:34.695 --> 03:24:35.763
PLATFORMS WITHOUT RUNNING AFOUL

03:24:35.830 --> 03:24:37.298
OF THE FOURTH AMENDMENT, I THINK

03:24:37.365 --> 03:24:38.366
IS A VERY VALUABLE THING THAT

03:24:38.432 --> 03:24:40.101
YOU COULD DO FOR LOCAL

03:24:40.167 --> 03:24:41.335
GOVERNMENTS ACROSS THE STATE.

03:24:41.402 --> 03:24:42.837
THE SECOND ISSUE THEN, OF

03:24:42.903 --> 03:24:44.338
COURSE, IS, IS WHETHER THE

03:24:44.405 --> 03:24:45.439
BILL'S POSITION REGARDING THE

03:24:45.506 --> 03:24:47.241
FOURTH AMENDMENT IS VALID. AND

03:24:47.308 --> 03:24:48.976
YOU'VE SEEN MANY ARGUMENTS ABOUT

03:24:49.043 --> 03:24:50.811
THAT. SO RIGHT NOW, I THOUGHT IT

03:24:50.878 --> 03:24:52.213
WOULD BE HELPFUL TO JUST STEP

03:24:52.279 --> 03:24:54.415
BACK AND REMIND US WHAT THE

03:24:54.482 --> 03:24:56.217
CONTEXT CURRENTLY IS REGARDING

03:24:56.283 --> 03:24:57.385
DISCLOSURE OF ADDRESSES OF SHORT

03:24:57.451 --> 03:24:59.086
TERM RENTALS, RIGHT? IF YOU HAVE

03:24:59.153 --> 03:25:01.222
A SHORT TERM RENTAL AND YOU WANT

03:25:01.288 --> 03:25:03.658
TO LIST IT ON A PLATFORM LIKE

03:25:03.724 --> 03:25:05.960
AIRBNB, YOU'RE NECESSARILY DOING

03:25:06.027 --> 03:25:07.995
AT LEAST TWO THINGS. YOU'RE

03:25:08.062 --> 03:25:09.330
SHARING THAT PROPERTY'S ADDRESS

03:25:09.397 --> 03:25:10.598
WITH THE CORPORATION THAT LISTS

03:25:10.665 --> 03:25:11.932
YOUR PROPERTY ONLINE. MAYBE IT

03:25:11.999 --> 03:25:13.801
ISN'T PUBLICLY LISTED, BUT THE

03:25:13.868 --> 03:25:14.535
CORPORATION HAS THAT

03:25:14.602 --> 03:25:15.403
INFORMATION. AND OF COURSE,

03:25:15.469 --> 03:25:16.937
YOU'RE SHARING IT WITH THE

03:25:17.004 --> 03:25:18.506
STRANGERS WHO STAY AT YOUR

03:25:18.572 --> 03:25:19.540
PROPERTY WHEN AFTER THEY'VE

03:25:19.607 --> 03:25:21.776
BOOKED IT THROUGH IT. NOW,

03:25:21.842 --> 03:25:22.943
IMPORTANTLY, HOPEFULLY YOU'VE

03:25:23.010 --> 03:25:24.812
GONE TO YOUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT

03:25:24.879 --> 03:25:26.747
FOR A BUSINESS LICENSE AND A TOT

03:25:26.814 --> 03:25:28.215
CERTIFICATE AND ANYTHING ELSE

03:25:28.282 --> 03:25:30.017
THAT THEY MIGHT REQUIRE. WHEN

03:25:30.084 --> 03:25:31.318
YOU DO THAT, YOU'RE ALSO

03:25:31.385 --> 03:25:32.787
REQUIRED TO GIVE THE GOVERNMENT

03:25:32.853 --> 03:25:33.954
THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE

03:25:34.021 --> 03:25:35.289
ADDRESS OF THE PROPERTY FOR YOUR

03:25:35.356 --> 03:25:36.857
SHORT TERM RENTAL. SO THAT'S

03:25:36.924 --> 03:25:38.993
ALREADY HAPPENING. NOW, AFTER

03:25:39.060 --> 03:25:41.228
ALL THAT'S OCCURRED, ALL THIS

03:25:41.295 --> 03:25:43.030
BILL STEPS IN AND SAYS THAT THAT

03:25:43.097 --> 03:25:45.199
CITY SHOULD BE ABLE TO ASK THE

03:25:45.266 --> 03:25:46.200
PLATFORM FOR THE SAME ADDRESS

03:25:46.267 --> 03:25:48.002
THEY BOTH SHOULD ALREADY HAVE.

03:25:48.069 --> 03:25:49.503
AND THE IDEA THAT THAT VIOLATES

03:25:49.570 --> 03:25:50.705
A PRIVACY INTEREST UNDER THE

03:25:50.771 --> 03:25:51.605
FOURTH AMENDMENT, FRANKLY,

03:25:51.672 --> 03:25:54.175
STRIKES ME AS JUST SILLY. AND

03:25:54.241 --> 03:25:55.276
WITH THAT, I'LL STOP MY THANK

03:25:55.342 --> 03:25:59.180
YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE HERE

03:25:59.246 --> 03:26:04.285
IN SUPPORT OF SB 346? THANK YOU,

03:26:04.351 --> 03:26:05.986

AIRBNB, WE HAVE AN OPPOSED

03:29:10.804 --> 03:29:12.072
UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE

03:29:12.139 --> 03:29:13.841
BILL. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE

03:29:13.908 --> 03:29:14.408
COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR YOUR

03:29:14.475 --> 03:29:15.910
ENGAGEMENT ON THE ISSUE, AND I

03:29:15.976 --> 03:29:17.011
APPRECIATE THE MANY DISCUSSIONS

03:29:17.077 --> 03:29:18.379
OVER THE PAST MONTH. I WAS GOING

03:29:18.445 --> 03:29:20.047
TO RAISE A FEW ISSUES WITH THE

03:29:20.114 --> 03:29:22.249
ANALYSIS, BUT I'LL LEAVE THAT TO

03:29:22.316 --> 03:29:23.450
MY COLLEAGUE HERE. I JUST WANT

03:29:23.517 --> 03:29:24.885
TO ADDRESS A COUPLE THINGS I

03:29:24.952 --> 03:29:26.186
HEARD REGARDING TOT COLLECTION.

03:29:26.253 --> 03:29:27.554
AIRBNB HAS NEVER REFUSED TO DO

03:29:27.621 --> 03:29:29.757
AN AUDIT. IF CITIES HAVE ISSUES

03:29:29.823 --> 03:29:33.093
WITH VERIFYING THE TAX, WE OPEN

03:29:33.160 --> 03:29:34.762
UP THE RECORDS, LET THEM EXAMINE

03:29:34.828 --> 03:29:37.064
IT. THIS BILL HAS A PROVISION

03:29:37.131 --> 03:29:38.699
WHICH WE THINK CLARIFIES

03:29:38.766 --> 03:29:40.534
EXISTING LAW THAT UNDER THEIR

03:29:40.601 --> 03:29:41.702
EXISTING TAX AUTHORITY, CITIES

03:29:41.769 --> 03:29:43.671
AND COUNTIES CAN AUDIT. WE

03:29:43.737 --> 03:29:44.905
SUPPORT THAT. NOT FIGHTING THAT.

03:29:44.972 --> 03:29:47.441
NO PROBLEM. THERE WE HAVE THE

03:29:47.508 --> 03:29:49.476
ISSUE IS WITH PROVIDING BROAD,

03:29:49.543 --> 03:29:51.412
BROAD BRUSH INFORMATION

03:29:51.478 --> 03:29:53.180
ADDRESSES FOR OTHER PURPOSES,

03:29:53.247 --> 03:29:56.317
NON NON TAX PURPOSES. I ALSO

03:29:56.383 --> 03:29:59.219
HEARD THAT JUST BECAUSE

03:29:59.286 --> 03:30:00.688
OPERATORS PROVIDE THE CITIES

03:30:00.754 --> 03:30:03.190
THEIR ADDRESSES, THEY WAVE THEIR

03:30:03.257 --> 03:30:04.758
THEIR PRIVACY CLAIMS. WELL IN

03:30:04.825 --> 03:30:06.493
THIS CASE IT WOULD REQUIRE US TO

03:30:06.560 --> 03:30:08.462
PROVIDE ADDRESSES FOR THOSE WHO

03:30:08.529 --> 03:30:09.763
HAVE PROVIDED THE ADDRESSES TO

03:30:09.830 --> 03:30:11.498
THE CITIES AND THOSE WHO HAVE

03:30:11.565 --> 03:30:12.866
NOT PROVIDED THOSE WHO HAVE NOT

03:30:12.933 --> 03:30:15.035
WAIVED THEIR CLAIM FOR PRIVACY.

03:30:15.102 --> 03:30:16.937
SO JUST TO ADDRESS WHAT I HEARD,

03:30:17.004 --> 03:30:18.572
MOVING ON TO MY TESTIMONY, WE

03:30:18.639 --> 03:30:20.174
AGREE WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF

03:30:20.240 --> 03:30:21.275
THAT THIS BILL IS COMPLETELY

03:30:21.342 --> 03:30:22.443
UNNECESSARY. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

03:30:22.509 --> 03:30:24.011
HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO PASS

03:30:24.078 --> 03:30:24.511
ORDINANCES THAT REQUIRE

03:30:24.578 --> 03:30:26.513
PLATFORMS TO COLLECT, TOT AND

03:30:26.580 --> 03:30:27.982
STAND UP PERMIT FIELDS. IF A

03:30:28.048 --> 03:30:29.783
CITY OR COUNTY WANTS TO ACCESS

03:30:29.850 --> 03:30:31.051
MORE INFORMATION FROM THE

03:30:31.118 --> 03:30:32.653
PLATFORMS BEYOND TAXPAYER

03:30:32.720 --> 03:30:34.488
INFORMATION FOR TAX PURPOSES,

03:30:34.555 --> 03:30:35.889
THEN THEY NEED TO PROVIDE AN

03:30:35.956 --> 03:30:37.057
ADMINISTRATIVE SUBPOENA PURSUANT

03:30:37.124 --> 03:30:39.193
TO LOCAL LAWS. THIS IS THE CASE

03:30:39.259 --> 03:30:41.061
IN SAN FRANCISCO. THIS IS THE

03:30:41.128 --> 03:30:42.830
CASE IN SANTA MONICA. AND THIS

03:30:42.896 --> 03:30:44.198
WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE CASE FOR

03:30:44.264 --> 03:30:45.499
ANY OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHO

03:30:45.566 --> 03:30:47.735
OPT IN TO THIS BILL, SHOULD IT

03:30:47.801 --> 03:30:49.737
PASS. CITY CITY ATTORNEYS

03:30:49.803 --> 03:30:51.138
OVERSEE THE ENFORCEMENT OF LOCAL

03:30:51.205 --> 03:30:52.606
LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING

03:30:52.673 --> 03:30:54.174
SHORT TERM RENTAL ORDINANCES, IF

03:30:54.241 --> 03:30:56.043
THEY HAVE CONCERN OVER OPERATORS

03:30:56.110 --> 03:30:57.311
VIOLATING STR ORDINANCE, THEY

03:30:57.378 --> 03:30:59.013
HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE

03:30:59.079 --> 03:31:00.614
SUBPOENAS TO THE PLATFORM FOR

03:31:00.681 --> 03:31:01.448
PHYSICAL ADDRESSES AND OTHER

03:31:01.515 --> 03:31:02.416
DATA RELATED OPERATORS

03:31:02.483 --> 03:31:03.951
ADVERTISING ON THEIR WEBSITE.

03:31:04.018 --> 03:31:06.253
THIS IS A ROUTINE PROCESS THAT

03:31:06.320 --> 03:31:07.521
RARELY ENDS UP IN COURT, IN

03:31:07.588 --> 03:31:09.089
FACT, A MAJORITY OF THE TIME.

03:31:09.156 --> 03:31:11.358
AND THAT WENT REALLY FAST. I

03:31:11.425 --> 03:31:13.961
ASKED FOR NO VOTE. THANK YOU. I

03:31:14.028 --> 03:31:16.063
WAS GOING TO LET YOU FINISH YOUR

03:31:16.130 --> 03:31:17.097
COMMENT IF YOU WANT. ALL RIGHT.

03:31:17.164 --> 03:31:19.833
YES. GO AHEAD. YEAH. GOOD

03:31:19.900 --> 03:31:21.035
MORNING. MY NAME IS ALYSSA

03:31:21.101 --> 03:31:22.636
STINSON. I'M THE SENIOR MANAGER

03:31:22.703 --> 03:31:23.437
OVERSEEING CALIFORNIA STATE AND

03:31:23.504 --> 03:31:25.005
LOCAL GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS WITH

03:31:25.072 --> 03:31:26.573
EXPEDIA GROUP. WE RESPECTFULLY

03:31:26.640 --> 03:31:29.176
OPPOSE, UNLESS AMENDED TO SB

03:31:29.243 --> 03:31:30.210
THREE 4346. WHILE THE AMENDMENTS

03:31:30.277 --> 03:31:31.478
OUT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT WERE

03:31:31.545 --> 03:31:32.513
SIGNIFICANT, AND MOVING THE

03:31:32.579 --> 03:31:33.981
NEEDLE FOR US AND ADDRESS MANY

03:31:34.048 --> 03:31:35.883
OF OUR CONCERNS, OUR REMAINING

03:31:35.949 --> 03:31:36.483
MAJOR CONCERN RELATES TO THE

03:31:36.550 --> 03:31:38.052
ADMINISTRATIVE SUBPOENA PROCESS.

03:31:38.118 --> 03:31:38.619
PENDING ANALYSIS RAISES THE

03:31:38.685 --> 03:31:39.586
QUESTION WHY THE SUPPORTERS

03:31:39.653 --> 03:31:42.122
THINK THE BILL IS SO URGENTLY

03:31:42.189 --> 03:31:42.723
NEEDED, AND EQUALLY, WHY THE

03:31:42.790 --> 03:31:43.690
OPPONENTS ARE STRONGLY

03:31:43.757 --> 03:31:44.858
OBJECTING. VALID POINT AND VALID

03:31:44.925 --> 03:31:46.593
QUESTION. SPEAKING FOR EXPEDIA

03:31:46.660 --> 03:31:47.995
GROUP, OUR REMAINING OPPOSITION

03:31:48.062 --> 03:31:49.029
STEMS FROM THE CONFLICTING

03:31:49.096 --> 03:31:50.164
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THIS BILL

03:31:50.230 --> 03:31:52.666
ACTUALLY DOES. IF STATEWIDE

03:31:52.733 --> 03:31:53.667
LEGISLATION TELLING LOCAL

03:31:53.734 --> 03:31:54.268
JURISDICTIONS THEY MAY

03:31:54.334 --> 03:31:55.469
INFORMALLY REQUEST DATA FROM

03:31:55.536 --> 03:31:56.837
HOSTING PLATFORMS, THEY WILL

03:31:56.904 --> 03:31:58.572
BELIEVE YOU, EVEN EVEN IF THIS

03:31:58.639 --> 03:32:00.340
IS CONTRARY TO FEDERAL LAW. IT

03:32:00.407 --> 03:32:02.276
SETS THE ADMINISTRATIVE SUBPOENA

03:32:02.342 --> 03:32:04.044
PROCESS, SETS THE EXPECTATION UP

03:32:04.111 --> 03:32:05.412
FRONT ON HOW THE DATA CAN

03:32:05.479 --> 03:32:06.780
LEGALLY BE ACQUIRED FROM

03:32:06.847 --> 03:32:08.115
PLATFORMS ON AN AD HOC BASIS. SO

03:32:08.182 --> 03:32:10.050
WE DON'T CREATE NEW TENSIONS

03:32:10.117 --> 03:32:11.685
WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OVER THE

03:32:11.752 --> 03:32:13.020
MISUNDERSTANDING. ADMINISTRATIVE

03:32:13.087 --> 03:32:14.655
SUBPOENAS ARE RELATIVELY SIMPLE,

03:32:14.721 --> 03:32:16.323
CAN BE A FEW PAGES, AND CAN BE

03:32:16.390 --> 03:32:17.958
ISSUED BY ANY CITY ATTORNEY OR

03:32:18.025 --> 03:32:19.927
COUNTY COUNSEL. WE REGULARLY

03:32:19.993 --> 03:32:21.061
REVIEW AND TIMELY RESPOND TO

03:32:21.128 --> 03:32:22.396
THOSE SUBPOENA REQUESTS WITH

03:32:22.463 --> 03:32:23.931
RESPONSIVE DOCUMENTS. BY

03:32:23.997 --> 03:32:25.766
CONTRAST, WE DO NOT PROVIDE DATA

03:32:25.833 --> 03:32:26.400
TO JURISDICTIONS WHO MAKE

03:32:26.467 --> 03:32:27.968
INFORMAL REQUESTS, AS WE LACK

03:32:28.035 --> 03:32:29.303
SUFFICIENT LEGAL COMPULSION TO

03:32:29.369 --> 03:32:31.371
DO SO. I'D ALSO LIKE TO ADDRESS

03:32:31.438 --> 03:32:33.607
SOME OF THE POINTS MADE BY THE

03:32:33.674 --> 03:32:34.675
ANALYSIS REGARDING THE LEGAL

03:32:34.741 --> 03:32:36.243
CASES, BOTH IN SANTA MONICA AND

03:32:36.310 --> 03:32:37.678
SAN FRANCISCO CASES REINFORCE

03:32:37.744 --> 03:32:39.379
OUR POSITION THAT ADMINISTRATIVE

03:32:39.446 --> 03:32:40.881
SUBPOENA IS ESSENTIAL FOR

03:32:40.948 --> 03:32:42.116
COMPETING FOR COMPELLING THE

03:32:42.182 --> 03:32:44.751
PRODUCTION OF HOST DATA, LIKE IN

03:32:44.818 --> 03:32:46.787
SANTA MONICA, THE COURT UPHELD

03:32:46.854 --> 03:32:48.088
THE ORDINANCE'S DATA SHARING

03:32:48.155 --> 03:32:49.189
PROVISIONS PRECISELY BECAUSE

03:32:49.256 --> 03:32:50.657
THEY WERE TIED TO AN

03:32:50.724 --> 03:32:53.127
ADMINISTRATIVE SUBPOENA PROCESS

03:32:53.193 --> 03:32:54.595
FOR THE CITY TO OBTAIN

03:32:54.661 --> 03:32:55.596
INFORMATION DESCRIBED.

03:32:55.662 --> 03:32:57.064
SIMILARLY, IN SAN FRANCISCO, THE

03:32:57.131 --> 03:32:58.265
COURT ENFORCED THE CITY'S

03:32:58.332 --> 03:32:59.700
REQUEST ONLY AFTER A PROPERLY

03:32:59.766 --> 03:33:01.135
SERVED ADMINISTRATIVE SUBPOENA

03:33:01.201 --> 03:33:03.470
HAD BEEN ISSUED. IN BOTH CASES,

03:33:03.537 --> 03:33:05.005
THE ORDINANCE SUCCEEDED BECAUSE

03:33:05.072 --> 03:33:06.306
THE REQUIRED LEGAL FORMAL

03:33:06.373 --> 03:33:08.242
PROCESS, NOT INFORMAL REQUEST

03:33:08.308 --> 03:33:11.812
FOR ACCESSING PLATFORM DATA. BY

03:33:11.879 --> 03:33:13.280
CONTRAST, SB 346 RELIES ON

03:33:13.347 --> 03:33:14.581
INFORMAL REQUESTS, WHICH LACK

03:33:14.648 --> 03:33:16.783
LEGAL COMPULSION UPHELD IN THESE

03:33:16.850 --> 03:33:19.253
CASES, WHERE WE ARE THEREFORE

03:33:19.319 --> 03:33:21.121
REQUESTING THAT 346 BE AMENDED

03:33:21.188 --> 03:33:23.357
TO INCLUDE THE LEGAL REQUIREMENT

03:33:23.423 --> 03:33:25.959
FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SUBPOENA, AND

03:33:26.026 --> 03:33:27.327
FOR THESE REASONS STATED IN OUR

03:33:27.394 --> 03:33:29.496
AND THE REASONS STATED IN OUR

03:33:29.563 --> 03:33:30.097
LETTER, WE ARE OPPOSED UNLESS

03:33:30.164 --> 03:33:32.032
AMENDED. THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

03:33:32.099 --> 03:33:34.968
ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION TO SB

03:33:35.035 --> 03:33:36.003
346? YES. MR. CHAIRMAN AND

03:33:36.069 --> 03:33:37.037
MEMBERS. ELOY GARCIA FOR

03:33:37.104 --> 03:33:38.539
BOOKINGS. HOLDINGS ALSO WITH

03:33:38.605 --> 03:33:40.541
OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION

03:33:40.607 --> 03:33:42.242
FOR THE EXACT SAME AMENDMENTS.

03:33:42.309 --> 03:33:46.280
THANK YOU. CHAIR MEMBERS JOSE

03:33:46.346 --> 03:33:47.648
TORRES WITH TECHNET AND RESPECT

03:33:47.714 --> 03:33:49.950
FOR OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. ALL

03:33:50.017 --> 03:33:51.885
RIGHT. WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO

03:33:51.952 --> 03:33:53.287
THE COMMITTEE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

03:33:53.353 --> 03:33:57.124
BAUER-KAHAN. OKAY. I'M

03:33:57.191 --> 03:33:59.393
THOROUGHLY CONFUSED. OKAY. LET

03:33:59.459 --> 03:34:01.161
ME START BY THANKING THE AUTHOR

03:34:01.228 --> 03:34:03.964
FOR DOING THIS IN THE EARLY PART

03:34:04.031 --> 03:34:05.265
OF MY CAREER, THERE WAS A MASS

03:34:05.332 --> 03:34:07.201
SHOOTING AT AN ILLEGAL AIRBNB IN

03:34:07.267 --> 03:34:10.103
MY CITY. IT WAS A PARTY HOUSE.

03:34:10.170 --> 03:34:12.239
THE CITY DID HAVE AN ORDINANCE

03:34:12.306 --> 03:34:15.442
REQUIRING THAT THOSE RENTING OUT

03:34:15.509 --> 03:34:17.611
THEIR HOMES GET PERMISSION FROM

03:34:17.678 --> 03:34:20.214
THE CITY. THIS WAS NOT ILLEGAL

03:34:20.280 --> 03:34:23.517
RENTAL. FIVE PEOPLE WERE SHOT

03:34:23.584 --> 03:34:25.586
AND KILLED. THE HOUSE WAS UP A

03:34:25.652 --> 03:34:27.487
ONE WAY NARROW STREET IN MY

03:34:27.554 --> 03:34:28.555
COMMUNITY. THE CARS FROM THE

03:34:28.622 --> 03:34:30.390
PARTY BLOCKED THE WHOLE STREET

03:34:30.457 --> 03:34:31.725
SO THE AMBULANCES COULDN'T EVEN

03:34:31.792 --> 03:34:33.460
GET TO THE HOUSE TO ASSIST THE

03:34:33.527 --> 03:34:36.830
VICTIMS WHO WERE DYING. SO THIS

03:34:36.897 --> 03:34:38.565
IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS SO

03:34:38.632 --> 03:34:39.566
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT, BECAUSE MY

03:34:39.633 --> 03:34:41.468
CITY JUST WANTED TO KEEP PEOPLE

03:34:41.535 --> 03:34:43.604
SAFE. I REPRESENT AN INCREDIBLY

03:34:43.670 --> 03:34:45.806
INTENSE WILDFIRE ZONE WHERE WE

03:34:45.872 --> 03:34:47.474
MAKE VERY THOUGHTFUL DECISIONS

03:34:47.541 --> 03:34:49.309
ABOUT WHAT WE ALLOW ON OUR WUI

03:34:49.376 --> 03:34:51.778
AND WHAT WE ALLOW DOWNTOWN. AND

03:34:51.845 --> 03:34:53.680
MY CONFUSION ABOUT THIS

03:34:53.747 --> 03:34:55.082
CONVERSATION STARTS WITH THESE

03:34:55.148 --> 03:34:56.984
ARE BUSINESSES. IF YOU WANT TO

03:34:57.050 --> 03:34:59.186
OPEN A BUSINESS IN MY CITY, YOU

03:34:59.253 --> 03:35:00.487
HAVE TO GET A BUSINESS LICENSE.

03:35:00.554 --> 03:35:01.855
IF YOU GET YOUR BUSINESS

03:35:01.922 --> 03:35:03.290
LICENSE, YOU SHARE THE LOCATION

03:35:03.357 --> 03:35:04.958
OF THAT BUSINESS WITH THE CITY.

03:35:05.025 --> 03:35:06.460
THAT ISN'T PRIVATE INFORMATION.

03:35:06.526 --> 03:35:07.728
I DON'T KNOW THAT ANYBODY THINKS

03:35:07.794 --> 03:35:09.997
THE LOCATION OF A BUSINESS IS

03:35:10.063 --> 03:35:13.166
PRIVATE INFORMATION. SO I

03:35:13.233 --> 03:35:13.900
FUNDAMENTALLY START FROM A

03:35:13.967 --> 03:35:15.569
DIFFERENT PLACE THAN YOU DO. I

03:35:15.636 --> 03:35:16.803
THINK ABOUT WHETHER SOMEONE

03:35:16.870 --> 03:35:18.505
WHO'S RENTING OUT THEIR HOME HAS

03:35:18.572 --> 03:35:20.874
A RIGHT TO PRIVACY AROUND THAT

03:35:20.941 --> 03:35:22.843
FACT. I DON'T THINK THEY DO. IF

03:35:22.909 --> 03:35:24.278
YOU'RE OPTING TO DO THIS, I

03:35:24.344 --> 03:35:25.979
THINK THAT THE CITY HAS A RIGHT

03:35:26.046 --> 03:35:27.114
TO KNOW THAT THAT'S HAPPENING IN

03:35:27.180 --> 03:35:28.715
THEIR JURISDICTION FOR REASONS

03:35:28.782 --> 03:35:30.384
THAT I THINK RELATE TO IMPORTANT

03:35:30.450 --> 03:35:32.753
TAXES, BUT ALSO THE HEALTH AND

03:35:32.819 --> 03:35:34.421
SAFETY OF THE COMMUNITY, WHICH I

03:35:34.488 --> 03:35:37.057
THINK IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THE ROLE

03:35:37.124 --> 03:35:39.693
WE SERVE HERE. SO THAT'S THE

03:35:39.760 --> 03:35:41.128
PREMISE I'M STARTING WITH. NOW.

03:35:41.194 --> 03:35:42.329
WHAT I'M CONFUSED ABOUT IS WHAT

03:35:42.396 --> 03:35:44.164
I HEARD YOU SAY, WHICH WAS A

03:35:44.231 --> 03:35:46.099
LITTLE DIFFERENT, WAS THAT YOU

03:35:46.166 --> 03:35:50.170
ALLOW AUDITS. CAN YOU EXPLAIN

03:35:50.237 --> 03:35:54.641
THAT PROCESS? SURE. SO UNDER THE

03:35:54.708 --> 03:35:55.575
EXISTING UNDER THE CITY'S

03:35:55.642 --> 03:35:57.344
EXISTING TAX AUTHORITY, THEY

03:35:57.411 --> 03:35:59.212
HAVE THE POWER TO AUDIT

03:35:59.279 --> 03:36:02.049
TAXPAYERS. SO THE PLATFORM

03:36:02.115 --> 03:36:04.217
AIRBNB COLLECTS IN OVER 90

03:36:04.284 --> 03:36:05.719
DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS, THEY

03:36:05.786 --> 03:36:07.220
COLLECT THE TOT AT THE POINT OF

03:36:07.287 --> 03:36:09.389
TRANSACTION THAT 8% 10% GOES TO

03:36:09.456 --> 03:36:10.390
ACCOUNT THE REMITTED TO THE

03:36:10.457 --> 03:36:12.225
CITY. THE CITY TREASURER TAX

03:36:12.292 --> 03:36:14.561
COLLECTOR CAN AUDIT THE PLATFORM

03:36:14.628 --> 03:36:15.862
THE TAXPAYER IN THOSE INSTANCES

03:36:15.929 --> 03:36:16.897
UNDER THEIR EXISTING AUTHORITY.

03:36:16.963 --> 03:36:18.665
AND IT HAPPENS. RIGHT. SO IF

03:36:18.732 --> 03:36:21.501
THEY ARE AUDITING. SO I'M YOU'VE

03:36:21.568 --> 03:36:24.371
COLLECTED FROM TEN HOMES IN MY

03:36:24.438 --> 03:36:26.206
CITY. I DON'T HAVE A TON OF

03:36:26.273 --> 03:36:28.008
AIRBNBS IN MY TINY LITTLE CITY.

03:36:28.075 --> 03:36:29.476
THE CITY CAN CHECK AND MAKE SURE

03:36:29.543 --> 03:36:32.079
THEY'VE RECEIVED THOSE TEN

03:36:32.145 --> 03:36:33.580
HOMES. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE 15

03:36:33.647 --> 03:36:35.148
THAT WEREN'T LEGAL? LIKE CAN THE

03:36:35.215 --> 03:36:37.751
AUDIT PROCESS FIND THE ONES THAT

03:36:37.818 --> 03:36:39.986
WEREN'T LICENSED? LIKE I'M

03:36:40.053 --> 03:36:42.456
CONFUSED. YES, THE AUDIT PROCESS

03:36:42.522 --> 03:36:43.824
CAN UNCOVER THAT TYPE OF

03:36:43.890 --> 03:36:46.560
INFORMATION. THE INFORMATION

03:36:46.626 --> 03:36:48.128
THAT'S PROVIDED IS BASICALLY ALL

03:36:48.195 --> 03:36:49.529
THE TRANSACTIONS WITHIN THAT

03:36:49.596 --> 03:36:50.330
JURISDICTION OVER A GIVEN PERIOD

03:36:50.397 --> 03:36:54.501
OF TIME. THE CONVENTIONAL WAY OF

03:36:54.568 --> 03:36:56.002
AUDITING IS THROUGH THE

03:36:56.069 --> 03:36:57.838
METHODOLOGY OR SAMPLING METHOD

03:36:57.904 --> 03:36:59.639
WHERE YOU SAMPLE, YOU KNOW, YOU

03:36:59.706 --> 03:37:02.509
DON'T YOU DON'T VERIFY EVERY

03:37:02.576 --> 03:37:04.211
10,000 RECORDS. YOU KIND OF DO A

03:37:04.277 --> 03:37:05.946
SAMPLING. IF THOSE ARE ALL

03:37:06.012 --> 03:37:07.214
ACCURATE, THEN THAT'S GENERALLY

03:37:07.280 --> 03:37:09.449
ACCEPTED Þ SO THEY DON'T GET A

03:37:09.516 --> 03:37:11.852
LIST OF EVERYTHING THAT THEY'VE

03:37:11.918 --> 03:37:12.953
COLLECTED. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING

03:37:13.019 --> 03:37:14.354
IF THEY WANT THE PHYSICAL

03:37:14.421 --> 03:37:15.989
ADDRESSES IN THE COURSE OF AN

03:37:16.056 --> 03:37:17.758
AUDIT THAT IS PROVIDED AND MADE

03:37:17.824 --> 03:37:20.160
AVAILABLE. MAY I, MR. CHAIR, IS

03:37:20.227 --> 03:37:22.996
IT OKAY IF THE. OKAY. THANK YOU.

03:37:23.063 --> 03:37:24.898
THE ONLY IN CASES WHERE THE

03:37:24.965 --> 03:37:25.932
VOLUNTARY COLLECTION AGREEMENTS

03:37:25.999 --> 03:37:27.367
ARE SIGNED ARE THEY COLLECTING

03:37:27.434 --> 03:37:30.670
THE TOT. AND IN THOSE AGREEMENTS

03:37:30.737 --> 03:37:32.072
THEMSELVES, LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

03:37:32.139 --> 03:37:33.473
MUST FIRST AGREE THAT THEY WILL

03:37:33.540 --> 03:37:34.941
NEVER HAVE ACCESS TO THE

03:37:35.008 --> 03:37:36.410
ADDRESSES FROM WHERE THE MONEY

03:37:36.476 --> 03:37:38.178
IS COMING. AND ON TOP OF IT, AT

03:37:38.245 --> 03:37:39.679
LEAST ON AIRBNB'S WEBSITE, THEY

03:37:39.746 --> 03:37:43.250
PROVIDE A MECHANISM FOR HOSTS IN

03:37:43.316 --> 03:37:45.051
JURISDICTIONS WITH VCAS TO OPT

03:37:45.118 --> 03:37:46.586
OUT OF THE PLATFORM, COLLECTING

03:37:46.653 --> 03:37:48.221
THE TOT AT ALL. AND THERE'S A

03:37:48.288 --> 03:37:50.524
LINK TO THAT IN MY LETTER TO THE

03:37:50.590 --> 03:37:52.259
COMMITTEE. SO YOU MAY LIVE IN

03:37:52.325 --> 03:37:55.228
THE CITY OF ORINDA AND YOU MIGHT

03:37:55.295 --> 03:37:57.564
HAVE A VCA, BUT IF AIRBNB IS

03:37:57.631 --> 03:37:58.999
SUPPOSED TO BE COLLECTING, YOU

03:37:59.065 --> 03:38:00.634
CAN STILL OPT OUT OF THAT. SO

03:38:00.700 --> 03:38:02.235
NOW THE AUDITOR IN THE CITY OF

03:38:02.302 --> 03:38:04.037
ORINDA DOESN'T EVEN KNOW IF

03:38:04.104 --> 03:38:06.306
EVERYONE THAT HAS AIRBNB IN

03:38:06.373 --> 03:38:07.874
ORINDA IS EVEN ACTUALLY LETTING

03:38:07.941 --> 03:38:09.309
THEM COLLECT THE TAX. SO THEY

03:38:09.376 --> 03:38:11.011
ALLOW THEM TO OPT OUT AND WE

03:38:11.077 --> 03:38:12.846
WON'T KNOW. THANK YOU. SO I

03:38:12.913 --> 03:38:14.214
GUESS I'M JUST PART OF WHAT'S

03:38:14.281 --> 03:38:15.615
CONFUSING ME HERE IS THE CITIES,

03:38:15.682 --> 03:38:17.517
I THINK, HAVE GOOD REASON TO

03:38:17.584 --> 03:38:18.452
WANT TO KNOW WHO'S OPERATING

03:38:18.518 --> 03:38:20.187
THESE BUSINESSES IN THEIR

03:38:20.253 --> 03:38:21.788
JURISDICTION. I BELIEVE THEY

03:38:21.855 --> 03:38:23.890
HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW THAT. YOU

03:38:23.957 --> 03:38:25.892
SAY THEY'RE BOTH. I THINK YOU

03:38:25.959 --> 03:38:27.127
HAD DIFFERENT EXPLANATIONS, BUT

03:38:27.194 --> 03:38:28.395
I THINK BOTH OF YOU SAID THERE

03:38:28.462 --> 03:38:29.863
ARE OTHER MECHANISMS WITH WHICH

03:38:29.930 --> 03:38:31.698
TO DO THAT. I WILL SAY,

03:38:31.765 --> 03:38:34.034
REPRESENTING ALL SMALL CITIES

03:38:34.100 --> 03:38:36.069
THAT DON'T HAVE THEY DON'T HAVE

03:38:36.136 --> 03:38:37.838
ATTORNEYS, RIGHT? THEY HAVE

03:38:37.904 --> 03:38:39.139
CONTRACT ATTORNEYS. THEY PAY A

03:38:39.206 --> 03:38:41.041
LOT OF MONEY TO EVERY TIME THEY

03:38:41.107 --> 03:38:42.342
WANT ANYTHING DIFFERENT THAN THE

03:38:42.409 --> 03:38:44.377
CITY OF LA, FOR EXAMPLE, OR SAN

03:38:44.444 --> 03:38:46.913
FRANCISCO, ASKING THEM TO GO

03:38:46.980 --> 03:38:49.149
THROUGH A LEGAL PROCESS EVERY

03:38:49.216 --> 03:38:50.150
TIME THEY WANT. THIS INFORMATION

03:38:50.217 --> 03:38:51.918
IS BURDENSOME, AND I GUESS I'M

03:38:51.985 --> 03:38:55.121
JUST NOT 100% CLEAR ON WHY THE

03:38:55.188 --> 03:38:57.691
PLATFORMS WOULDN'T BE OPEN TO

03:38:57.757 --> 03:38:59.159
WORKING WITH THE CITIES ON A

03:38:59.226 --> 03:39:00.260
SOLUTION THAT WOULD ALLOW THIS

03:39:00.327 --> 03:39:01.962
WITHOUT A BURDENSOME LEGAL

03:39:02.028 --> 03:39:04.197
PROCESS. IT SEEMS LIKE IT ISN'T

03:39:04.264 --> 03:39:05.065
NECESSARILY IN THE INTEREST OF

03:39:05.131 --> 03:39:07.033
THE PLATFORM TO BE HIDING. WHO

03:39:07.100 --> 03:39:09.269
IN THE CITIES ARE OPERATING

03:39:09.336 --> 03:39:10.237
THESE BUSINESSES? I GUESS THAT

03:39:10.303 --> 03:39:12.138
MAYBE MAYBE IT IS IN YOUR

03:39:12.205 --> 03:39:12.873
INTEREST, BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN

03:39:12.939 --> 03:39:14.241
GET MORE PEOPLE IF THEY'RE NOT

03:39:14.307 --> 03:39:16.142
GOING TO LICENSE THAT MANY. I

03:39:16.209 --> 03:39:18.612
DON'T, I GUESS I DON'T

03:39:18.678 --> 03:39:19.246
UNDERSTAND WHY WE'RE NOT SITTING

03:39:19.312 --> 03:39:20.247
HERE AT THE TABLE. AND I WILL

03:39:20.313 --> 03:39:21.982
SAY THIS WAS ACTUALLY FORMER

03:39:22.048 --> 03:39:22.883
SENATOR GLAZER AND I, THIS WAS

03:39:22.949 --> 03:39:25.118
SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY WANTED

03:39:25.185 --> 03:39:26.119
TO DO AND OUR CITY REALLY

03:39:26.186 --> 03:39:27.787
WANTED, AND WE HIT A LOT OF

03:39:27.854 --> 03:39:29.289
ROADBLOCKS IN THE PROCESS OF

03:39:29.356 --> 03:39:30.457
DOING THIS. AND I NEVER

03:39:30.524 --> 03:39:31.424
UNDERSTOOD THEM BECAUSE I THINK

03:39:31.491 --> 03:39:33.126
YOU ARE TECH COMPANIES, THAT IT

03:39:33.193 --> 03:39:34.294
SHOULD BE FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD

03:39:34.361 --> 03:39:35.295
TO CREATE EVEN A PORTAL THAT

03:39:35.362 --> 03:39:37.264
ALLOWS CITIES TO GO ON AND SEE.

03:39:37.330 --> 03:39:38.398
SO YOU'RE NOT SENDING A VÆ

03:39:38.465 --> 03:39:40.967
EMAIL, LIKE THERE HAS TO BE WAYS

03:39:41.034 --> 03:39:42.335
TO DO THIS. I'M GLAD YOU ASKED.

03:39:42.402 --> 03:39:43.904
WE HAVE THE CITY PORTAL

03:39:43.970 --> 03:39:45.438
AVAILABLE. IT'S NOT PUBLIC. IT'S

03:39:45.505 --> 03:39:46.673
AVAILABLE TO EVERY CITY OFFICIAL

03:39:46.740 --> 03:39:47.974
THAT'S IN CHARGE OF CODE

03:39:48.041 --> 03:39:49.142
ENFORCEMENT, AND IT GIVES THEM

03:39:49.209 --> 03:39:50.510
BASICALLY EASY ACCESS AND

03:39:50.577 --> 03:39:52.279
VISIBILITY INTO ALL OF THE

03:39:52.345 --> 03:39:54.080
LISTINGS IN THEIR CITY WITH THE

03:39:54.147 --> 03:39:55.582
ADDRESS, NOT WITH THE ADDRESS,

03:39:55.649 --> 03:39:57.284
BUT IT HAS ALL THE UNIQUE

03:39:57.350 --> 03:39:58.585
IDENTIFIER AND ALL THAT OTHER

03:39:58.652 --> 03:40:00.453
INFORMATION THAT THAT THEY NEED

03:40:00.520 --> 03:40:02.856
TO DO ENFORCEMENT. WHY NOT THE

03:40:02.923 --> 03:40:05.458
ADDRESS? SO AGAIN, FOR THE

03:40:05.525 --> 03:40:06.493
PHYSICAL ADDRESSES, THAT IS

03:40:06.560 --> 03:40:08.194
SOMETHING THAT THE COMPANY

03:40:08.261 --> 03:40:09.763
ASSERTS THEIR FOURTH AMENDMENT,

03:40:09.829 --> 03:40:11.164
THE PHYSICAL ADDRESSES ARE

03:40:11.231 --> 03:40:13.199
PRIVATE INFORMATION, PRIVATE

03:40:13.266 --> 03:40:15.168
INFORMATION. JUDGES. AND BOSTON

03:40:15.235 --> 03:40:16.937
AND NEW YORK FEDERAL JUDGES HAVE

03:40:17.003 --> 03:40:19.306
DEEMED THE PHYSICAL ADDRESSES

03:40:19.372 --> 03:40:20.707
THAT ARE NOT PUBLICLY FACING

03:40:20.774 --> 03:40:23.009
PRIVATE. AND YES, WE'RE NOT

03:40:23.076 --> 03:40:24.210
STAYING AWAY IF THE CITY WANTS

03:40:24.277 --> 03:40:25.845
TO GET AN ADDRESS BECAUSE IT'S A

03:40:25.912 --> 03:40:27.847
LOCAL BUSINESS, WE DON'T SIT IN

03:40:27.914 --> 03:40:29.382
THAT WAY. BY ALL MEANS, SET UP A

03:40:29.449 --> 03:40:31.084
LICENSING SYSTEM. WE ENCOURAGE

03:40:31.151 --> 03:40:31.885
YOU TO DO THAT. BUT THE

03:40:31.952 --> 03:40:33.486
DIFFERENCE IS THIS IS THE CITY

03:40:33.553 --> 03:40:35.088
GOING TO THE BUSINESS TO GET

03:40:35.155 --> 03:40:36.890
THAT INFORMATION. THIS BILL

03:40:36.957 --> 03:40:38.658
WANTS TO GO TO A THIRD PARTY TO

03:40:38.725 --> 03:40:40.961
GET THAT INFORMATION. OKAY. SO

03:40:41.027 --> 03:40:43.330
DO YOU. IF I AM A CITY THAT

03:40:43.396 --> 03:40:45.365
REQUIRES LICENSING NUMBERS,

03:40:45.432 --> 03:40:46.933
OKAY. RIGHT. SO SOME CITIES HAVE

03:40:47.000 --> 03:40:48.935
LICENSES AND PEOPLE ON YOUR

03:40:49.002 --> 03:40:50.370
PLATFORM LIST. I'VE SEEN THEM.

03:40:50.437 --> 03:40:52.572
RIGHT. LICENSE NUMBER WHATEVER.

03:40:52.639 --> 03:40:55.475
DO YOU CHECK THOSE LICENSING

03:40:55.542 --> 03:40:56.876
NUMBERS TO MAKE SURE EVERY

03:40:56.943 --> 03:40:59.446
LISTING ON YOUR PLATFORM IS

03:40:59.512 --> 03:41:00.213
LEGAL? DEPENDS ON THE

03:41:00.280 --> 03:41:01.514
JURISDICTION. WHEN THAT'S WHEN

03:41:01.581 --> 03:41:03.717
THAT'S MADE REQUIRED BY THE CITY

03:41:03.783 --> 03:41:05.819
ORDINANCE, THEN YES. AND HOW DO

03:41:05.885 --> 03:41:07.721
YOU DO THAT BASED ON THE CITY'S

03:41:07.787 --> 03:41:10.256
REGISTRY OR DEPENDING ON WHAT IS

03:41:10.323 --> 03:41:11.825
PROVIDED. AND TYPICALLY THERE

03:41:11.891 --> 03:41:12.859
ARE OTHER SITUATIONS WHERE

03:41:12.926 --> 03:41:14.561
THERE'S LIKE A NOTICE AND

03:41:14.628 --> 03:41:15.929
TAKEDOWN MODEL. SO THEY NOTIFY

03:41:15.996 --> 03:41:18.765
US OF A LISTING THAT OR THEY

03:41:18.832 --> 03:41:20.433
FOUND A LISTING THROUGH ONE OF

03:41:20.500 --> 03:41:21.868
THEIR THIRD PARTY SYSTEMS THAT

03:41:21.935 --> 03:41:24.804
THEY CONTRACT WITH US AND

03:41:24.871 --> 03:41:26.373
PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO US,

03:41:26.439 --> 03:41:27.874
SAYING, HEY, THIS IS AN ILLEGAL

03:41:27.941 --> 03:41:29.976
LISTING, OR THIS IS A LISTING

03:41:30.043 --> 03:41:30.844
THAT THEIR LICENSE HAS BEEN

03:41:30.910 --> 03:41:32.979
REVOKED. AND THEN WE TAKE THAT

03:41:33.046 --> 03:41:36.449
DOWN. SO I GUESS I WOULD PROFFER

03:41:36.516 --> 03:41:38.918
THAT MAYBE IF THEY DON'T LIKE

03:41:38.985 --> 03:41:40.520
THE IDEA OF SHARING THE

03:41:40.587 --> 03:41:42.322
ADDRESSES, PUTTING AN OBLIGATION

03:41:42.389 --> 03:41:45.525
ON THE PLATFORMS THAT THEY IT IS

03:41:45.592 --> 03:41:48.128
ON THEM TO CHECK THAT EVERY

03:41:48.194 --> 03:41:49.896
LISTING HAS BEEN LICENSED IN

03:41:49.963 --> 03:41:50.630
JURISDICTIONS THAT REQUIRES IT,

03:41:50.697 --> 03:41:53.199
AND CHECK THE ADDRESS AGAINST

03:41:53.266 --> 03:41:55.702
THE LICENSING AND STRICT

03:41:55.769 --> 03:41:56.670
LIABILITY ON THE PLATFORM IF

03:41:56.736 --> 03:41:58.371
THEY ALLOW FOR ILLEGAL UNKNOWN

03:41:58.438 --> 03:41:59.973
LISTINGS. COULD BE ANOTHER WAY

03:42:00.040 --> 03:42:01.341
TO DO THIS WHICH WOULDN'T

03:42:01.408 --> 03:42:02.642
REQUIRE YOU TO SHARE ADDRESSES.

03:42:02.709 --> 03:42:05.278
IS THAT YOUR PREFERENCE? I'D

03:42:05.345 --> 03:42:06.680
HAVE TO CHECK WITH MY CLIENT,

03:42:06.746 --> 03:42:08.048
BUT PROBABLY NOT. PROBABLY NOT.

03:42:08.114 --> 03:42:10.050
YEAH, NO, I WAS IMAGINING THAT

03:42:10.116 --> 03:42:11.451
WAS THE CASE, SO I ACTUALLY

03:42:11.518 --> 03:42:12.752
THINK THAT NO, THEY WOULDN'T

03:42:12.819 --> 03:42:14.587
WANT THAT. OF COURSE NOT. THEY.

03:42:14.654 --> 03:42:16.389
SO I GUESS GIVEN THAT YOU DON'T

03:42:16.456 --> 03:42:18.992
WANT TO DO THAT, THE SENATOR WHO

03:42:19.059 --> 03:42:23.530
IS KNOWN FOR. YOU KNOW, GOOD

03:42:23.596 --> 03:42:25.131
LEGISLATION HERE IS, I THINK,

03:42:25.198 --> 03:42:26.232
BEING GENEROUS IN JUST ASKING

03:42:26.299 --> 03:42:27.300
YOU TO SHARE THE INFORMATION OF

03:42:27.367 --> 03:42:29.169
WHERE THESE LISTINGS ARE SO THAT

03:42:29.235 --> 03:42:30.904
THE CITIES CAN MAKE SURE THEY'RE

03:42:30.970 --> 03:42:32.272
MANAGING BUSINESS IN A WAY THAT

03:42:32.338 --> 03:42:34.307
WORKS. SO WITH THAT, YOU KNOW,

03:42:34.374 --> 03:42:35.375
I'VE ALREADY MOVED THE BILL, BUT

03:42:35.442 --> 03:42:37.177
I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT. THANK

03:42:37.243 --> 03:42:39.179
YOU. AND AS WE CONTINUE THE

03:42:39.245 --> 03:42:39.779
CONVERSATION, SENATOR RUSSELL

03:42:39.846 --> 03:42:41.047
HAS TWO MORE BILLS. WE'RE TRYING

03:42:41.114 --> 03:42:42.916
TO BE DONE AROUND NOON FOR

03:42:42.982 --> 03:42:44.317
CAUCUS. JUST AS A REMINDER TO

03:42:44.384 --> 03:42:46.720
FOLKS, ASSEMBLY MEMBERS OF BURR.

03:42:46.786 --> 03:42:47.954
SO I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR.

03:42:48.021 --> 03:42:49.489
I MEAN, THIS IS CLEARLY A BILL

03:42:49.556 --> 03:42:50.990
THAT'S IMPORTANT, AND WE NEED

03:42:51.057 --> 03:42:52.892
IT. AND IT'S I THINK IT'S PRETTY

03:42:52.959 --> 03:42:53.860
CLEAR THAT THE CITIES HAVE AN

03:42:53.927 --> 03:42:55.662
INTEREST IN UNDERSTANDING THE

03:42:55.729 --> 03:42:56.196
ADDRESS. YOU KNOW, IF YOU

03:42:56.262 --> 03:42:59.599
ACTUALLY HAVE A PARTY HOUSE.

03:42:59.666 --> 03:43:02.102
THAT'S OPERATING, THE CITY WILL

03:43:02.168 --> 03:43:03.937
KNOW THAT ADDRESS. RIGHT. BUT

03:43:04.003 --> 03:43:05.672
THEN THE QUESTION IS, IS THAT

03:43:05.739 --> 03:43:07.040
WHO ARE THEY OPERATING IT

03:43:07.107 --> 03:43:09.375
THROUGH? RIGHT. AND IF IN THE

03:43:09.442 --> 03:43:11.878
OTHER DIRECTION, IF YOU ACTUALLY

03:43:11.945 --> 03:43:13.113
ARE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER

03:43:13.179 --> 03:43:15.048
YOU'RE COLLECTING ALL THE TEXTS,

03:43:15.115 --> 03:43:17.083
ALL YOUR TAXES, YOU SORT OF NEED

03:43:17.150 --> 03:43:19.552
TO KNOW THE ADDRESSES AT THE

03:43:19.619 --> 03:43:20.620
OTHER END. SO CLEARLY THERE

03:43:20.687 --> 03:43:21.921
NEEDS TO BE AN INTEREST IN THE

03:43:21.988 --> 03:43:23.456
ADDRESS. SO I MEAN, TO ME, YOU

03:43:23.523 --> 03:43:24.791
KNOW, THIS COMES DOWN TO THE

03:43:24.858 --> 03:43:26.993
WHOLE ISSUE OF WHETHER YOU'RE

03:43:27.060 --> 03:43:28.194
REQUESTING IT OR THERE'S AN

03:43:28.261 --> 03:43:29.295
ADMINISTRATIVE SUBPOENA, WHICH

03:43:29.362 --> 03:43:32.365
IS WHAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR. I,

03:43:32.432 --> 03:43:34.067
YOU KNOW, ADMINISTRATIVE

03:43:34.134 --> 03:43:34.934
SUBPOENAS, I THOUGHT, AND I

03:43:35.001 --> 03:43:37.103
THINK WHAT I'D ASK YOU TO

03:43:37.170 --> 03:43:37.971
SUPPORT THIS, NO MATTER WHAT,

03:43:38.037 --> 03:43:39.739
IT'S IMPORTANT, BILL, BUT I

03:43:39.806 --> 03:43:42.075
THINK IN TERMS OF JUST THE SORT

03:43:42.142 --> 03:43:44.978
OF MOVING AHEAD, I, YOU KNOW,

03:43:45.044 --> 03:43:47.313
I'M WONDERING IF A IF AN

03:43:47.380 --> 03:43:49.816
APPROACH WOULD BE TO JUST

03:43:49.883 --> 03:43:51.351
AUTHORIZE HOUSING DEPARTMENTS

03:43:51.417 --> 03:43:53.386
AND CITIES TO AUTHORIZE

03:43:53.453 --> 03:43:55.388
ADMINISTRATIVE SUBPOENAS, IF

03:43:55.455 --> 03:43:57.524
THAT IS THE IF THAT'S, YOU KNOW,

03:43:57.590 --> 03:43:59.893
IF THIS IS ABOUT, I THINK, WHAT

03:43:59.959 --> 03:44:01.861
THIS IS ABOUT AND WHAT IS NOT

03:44:01.928 --> 03:44:03.329
BEING SAID IS THAT THE ADDRESSES

03:44:03.396 --> 03:44:04.497
ARE PART OF COMPETITIVE DATA,

03:44:04.564 --> 03:44:06.032
AND THAT'S WHY THEY'RE TRYING TO

03:44:06.099 --> 03:44:08.201
PROTECT THIS IN SOME WAY. SO IS

03:44:08.268 --> 03:44:11.104
THERE ANOTHER WAY THAT IS NOT

03:44:11.171 --> 03:44:12.405
BURDENSOME ON CITIES? OBVIOUSLY,

03:44:12.472 --> 03:44:14.174
IF YOU'VE GOT TO GO TO A CITY

03:44:14.240 --> 03:44:16.075
ATTORNEY EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO

03:44:16.142 --> 03:44:17.110
DO THIS, OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A

03:44:17.177 --> 03:44:18.845
BURDEN. BUT IS THERE ANOTHER WAY

03:44:18.912 --> 03:44:20.046
IN WHICH YOU COULD ACTUALLY, I

03:44:20.113 --> 03:44:21.514
THOUGHT THAT WITH ADMINISTRATIVE

03:44:21.581 --> 03:44:22.248
SUBPOENAS, IF THERE'S

03:44:22.315 --> 03:44:22.849
LEGISLATION THAT AUTHORIZES

03:44:22.916 --> 03:44:23.883
CITIES TO ISSUE ADMINISTRATIVE

03:44:23.950 --> 03:44:25.785
SUBPOENAS BY PERHAPS THE HOUSING

03:44:25.852 --> 03:44:27.720
DEPARTMENT IN THE CITY OR

03:44:27.787 --> 03:44:31.191
WHOEVER'S ACTUALLY OPERATING THE

03:44:31.257 --> 03:44:31.991
PROGRAM, IF THAT MIGHT BE

03:44:32.058 --> 03:44:33.960
ANOTHER WAY. AND SO I JUST SORT

03:44:34.027 --> 03:44:35.528
OF PROFFER THAT OUT AND ASK YOU

03:44:35.595 --> 03:44:37.063
TO LOOK AT IT. AND BECAUSE I

03:44:37.130 --> 03:44:38.231
THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY THE

03:44:38.298 --> 03:44:40.166
MAJOR ISSUE ON THE BILL. AND

03:44:40.233 --> 03:44:41.234
OBVIOUSLY, I THINK IF YOU CAN

03:44:41.301 --> 03:44:42.802
AVOID LAWSUITS ABOUT THE

03:44:42.869 --> 03:44:44.037
LEGISLATION, THAT WOULD BE A

03:44:44.103 --> 03:44:45.505
GOOD THING, BECAUSE I THINK

03:44:45.572 --> 03:44:46.139
THERE'S A WHOLE LINE OF PEOPLE

03:44:46.206 --> 03:44:49.342
THAT WANT THIS BILL TO GO

03:44:49.409 --> 03:44:49.943
THROUGH FOR OBVIOUS REASONS.

03:44:50.009 --> 03:44:52.712
YEAH. I MEAN, A SUBPOENA IS JUST

03:44:52.779 --> 03:44:54.848
ANOTHER STEP FOR THE LOCAL

03:44:54.914 --> 03:44:56.616
GOVERNMENT TO TRY TO ENFORCE.

03:44:56.683 --> 03:44:57.984
AND THE POINT WE'RE TRYING TO

03:44:58.051 --> 03:44:59.919
MAKE HERE IS IT'S THEIR

03:44:59.986 --> 03:45:00.987
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE THE

03:45:01.054 --> 03:45:02.121
INFORMATION SO THAT CITIES CAN

03:45:02.188 --> 03:45:04.557
DO THEIR, THEIR JOB. AND THAT'S

03:45:04.624 --> 03:45:06.726
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE IS ALL

03:45:06.793 --> 03:45:08.995
KINDS OF IFS, ANDS OR BUTS. YOU

03:45:09.062 --> 03:45:11.231
CAN'T DO IT THIS WAY. IF YOU

03:45:11.297 --> 03:45:12.899
WANT TO DO IT THAT WAY, THEN YOU

03:45:12.966 --> 03:45:15.034
HAVE TO GET A SUBPOENA. IF YOU I

03:45:15.101 --> 03:45:17.704
MEAN, IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW, TRICK

03:45:17.770 --> 03:45:18.271
AFTER TRICK AFTER TRICK AND

03:45:18.338 --> 03:45:19.305
OBSTACLES AND THAT'S JUST WHAT

03:45:19.372 --> 03:45:20.540
WE'RE TRYING TO STOP HERE

03:45:20.607 --> 03:45:21.808
BECAUSE ALL THESE CITIES, ALL

03:45:21.875 --> 03:45:24.210
THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO IS

03:45:24.277 --> 03:45:26.145
COLLECT THEIR TAXES. SO THAT'S

03:45:26.212 --> 03:45:27.347
THE THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL THING

03:45:27.413 --> 03:45:29.182
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH

03:45:29.249 --> 03:45:31.184
HERE. AND THEY SUBMIT THE

03:45:31.251 --> 03:45:32.619
INFORMATION QUARTERLY. THEY GET,

03:45:32.685 --> 03:45:34.153
YOU KNOW, THE RIGHT INFORMATION

03:45:34.220 --> 03:45:35.121
INSTEAD OF MAKING THE CITIES

03:45:35.188 --> 03:45:36.990
HAVE TO TRACK THEM DOWN AND GET

03:45:37.056 --> 03:45:38.291
A SUBPOENA. OR IF THEY DON'T

03:45:38.358 --> 03:45:40.460
AGREE WITH THE SUBPOENA, THEY

03:45:40.526 --> 03:45:41.794
CAN DO SOMETHING. IT'S JUST

03:45:41.861 --> 03:45:45.198
THEY'RE MAKING IT A MESS TO DEAL

03:45:45.265 --> 03:45:47.000
WITH AND MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO

03:45:47.066 --> 03:45:48.868
COLLECT. COLLECT THE INFORMATION

03:45:48.935 --> 03:45:50.303
TO BE ABLE TO COLLECT THE TAXES.

03:45:50.370 --> 03:45:52.538
SO YOU HAVE A MORE BRILLIANT WAY

03:45:52.605 --> 03:45:54.674
OF, WELL, NO, NO, NO, SENATOR, I

03:45:54.741 --> 03:45:56.342
DON'T THE ONLY THING I WOULD

03:45:56.409 --> 03:45:59.345
ADD. SO, AS MISS LANG POINTED

03:45:59.412 --> 03:46:00.713
OUT, SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

03:46:00.780 --> 03:46:02.749
DON'T HAVE NECESSARILY HAVE THE

03:46:02.815 --> 03:46:03.917
ABILITY TO DO THIS

03:46:03.983 --> 03:46:05.285
ADMINISTRATIVE SUBPOENA PROCESS.

03:46:05.351 --> 03:46:08.488
MOST CITIES DO. I TAKE THE POINT

03:46:08.554 --> 03:46:10.356
THAT WE DO CURRENTLY AT MY

03:46:10.423 --> 03:46:11.724
CLIENTS HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO

03:46:11.791 --> 03:46:13.293
ISSUE THESE ADMINISTRATIVE

03:46:13.359 --> 03:46:14.827
SUBPOENAS, BUT THEY DO BECOME

03:46:14.894 --> 03:46:15.962
BURDENSOME. THAT'S WHY WE'VE

03:46:16.029 --> 03:46:17.997
ASKED FOR THIS BILL, IS THAT

03:46:18.064 --> 03:46:19.766
THEY THEY ARE TIME CONSUMING.

03:46:19.832 --> 03:46:21.134
THEY DO END UP IN CONTENTIOUS

03:46:21.200 --> 03:46:23.002
AROUND THE STATE, LIKE YOU HAVE

03:46:23.069 --> 03:46:23.670
DIFFERENT CITIES GETTING

03:46:23.736 --> 03:46:26.105
DIFFERENT RESULTS. AND SO AS TO

03:46:26.172 --> 03:46:27.373
THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THIS

03:46:27.440 --> 03:46:28.775
WILL RESULT IN LAWSUITS, I'M

03:46:28.841 --> 03:46:31.644
QUITE SURE IT WILL. BUT I

03:46:31.711 --> 03:46:32.845
UNDERSTAND THERE ARE THESE CASES

03:46:32.912 --> 03:46:34.881
OUT OF NEW YORK AND BOSTON. BUT

03:46:34.948 --> 03:46:36.282
I WOULD POINT OUT TWO THINGS.

03:46:36.349 --> 03:46:37.317
NUMBER ONE, AGAIN, WE'RE ALL

03:46:37.383 --> 03:46:38.151
LAWYERS SITTING AROUND THE TABLE

03:46:38.217 --> 03:46:40.586
HERE. THOSE ARE DECISIONS ON

03:46:40.653 --> 03:46:41.321
PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION, OKAY.

03:46:41.387 --> 03:46:42.355
THEY WERE NOT FINAL DECISIONS ON

03:46:42.422 --> 03:46:44.657
THE MERITS. AND BOTH OF THOSE

03:46:44.724 --> 03:46:46.793
CASES SETTLED OKAY. SO THE

03:46:46.859 --> 03:46:48.261
PLATFORMS DID NOT DECIDE, OH,

03:46:48.328 --> 03:46:49.696
WE'RE SO CONFIDENT BECAUSE THIS

03:46:49.762 --> 03:46:50.697
PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION DECISION

03:46:50.763 --> 03:46:51.898
THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO FOR A

03:46:51.965 --> 03:46:53.633
FINAL JUDGMENT ON THE MERITS,

03:46:53.700 --> 03:46:55.001
THEY SETTLED AND I HAVE THE

03:46:55.068 --> 03:46:56.135
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT FROM THE

03:46:56.202 --> 03:46:57.337
NEW YORK CASE RIGHT HERE IN

03:46:57.403 --> 03:46:59.839
FRONT OF ME. AND THEY AGREED TO

03:46:59.906 --> 03:47:01.474
A LAW FOR NEW YORK CITY THAT

03:47:01.541 --> 03:47:03.309
INCLUDES DISCLOSURES OF PHYSICAL

03:47:03.376 --> 03:47:05.111
ADDRESSES FOR THE SHORT TERM

03:47:05.178 --> 03:47:06.946
RENTALS. SO THE IDEA THAT THIS

03:47:07.013 --> 03:47:09.983
IS REALLY SUCH A BIG CONCERN IS,

03:47:10.049 --> 03:47:13.152
I THINK IT'S A STRAW MAN FOR THE

03:47:13.219 --> 03:47:15.688
REAL CONCERN, WHICH IS ALLOWING

03:47:15.755 --> 03:47:16.923
CITIES, ALL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS,

03:47:16.990 --> 03:47:18.958
NOT JUST I REPRESENT CITIES, SO

03:47:19.025 --> 03:47:20.059
I SAY CITIES, BUT LOCAL

03:47:20.126 --> 03:47:22.528
GOVERNMENTS TO EFFICIENTLY BOTH

03:47:22.595 --> 03:47:23.863
REGULATE FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY

03:47:23.930 --> 03:47:25.365
AND EFFICIENTLY ADMINISTER THEIR

03:47:25.431 --> 03:47:27.967
TAX CODES FOR TOURISM TAXES LIKE

03:47:28.034 --> 03:47:31.037
THE TOT. THANK YOU, MADAM VICE

03:47:31.104 --> 03:47:35.375
CHAIR. THANK YOU. I ENJOY

03:47:35.441 --> 03:47:36.509
TALKING ABOUT THIS AND LISTENING

03:47:36.576 --> 03:47:38.044
TO THIS DISCUSSION, AND I WANT

03:47:38.111 --> 03:47:39.312
TO COMMEND THE SENATOR FOR

03:47:39.379 --> 03:47:41.147
INTRODUCING THIS BILL. I WISH

03:47:41.214 --> 03:47:42.582
SHE HAD INTRODUCED THIS BILL

03:47:42.648 --> 03:47:44.183
WHEN THE CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH

03:47:44.250 --> 03:47:45.985
WENT THROUGH SHORT TERM RENTAL,

03:47:46.052 --> 03:47:47.887
A TEN YEAR CYCLE, A TEN YEAR

03:47:47.954 --> 03:47:51.124
PROCESS. WHEN I WAS ON THE CITY

03:47:51.190 --> 03:47:52.759
COUNCIL WHEN I WAS MAYOR,

03:47:52.825 --> 03:47:54.494
STARTED IN 2015, WHEN IT WAS THE

03:47:54.560 --> 03:47:56.896
BEGINNING OF THE ONLINE AIRBNB

03:47:56.963 --> 03:47:59.165
VRBO PROCESS, AND WE DID NOT

03:47:59.232 --> 03:48:01.134
HAVE AN ORDINANCE, AND WE HAD TO

03:48:01.200 --> 03:48:02.201
CREATE ONE BECAUSE THERE WAS NO

03:48:02.268 --> 03:48:04.470
OTHER MODEL ORDINANCE. AND IT

03:48:04.537 --> 03:48:05.505
WAS A REALLY DIFFICULT ISSUE IN

03:48:05.571 --> 03:48:08.708
THE CITY AS AGAINST THE GROWTH

03:48:08.775 --> 03:48:11.711
AND SUPPORT AND THE SUCCESS OF

03:48:11.778 --> 03:48:13.579
AIRBNB, OUR RESIDENTS, MANY OF

03:48:13.646 --> 03:48:15.415
OUR RESIDENTS WANTED THE SHORT

03:48:15.481 --> 03:48:17.383
TERM RENTAL OPTION. OF COURSE,

03:48:17.450 --> 03:48:18.851
IT'S THEIR PRIVATE PROPERTY.

03:48:18.918 --> 03:48:20.086
THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO WHAT

03:48:20.153 --> 03:48:22.021
THEY WANT. THEIR NEXT DOOR

03:48:22.088 --> 03:48:23.022
NEIGHBOR MAY NOT AGREE BECAUSE

03:48:23.089 --> 03:48:25.091
OF THE PARTIES AND THE WEEKENDS

03:48:25.158 --> 03:48:26.092
AND THE BACHELOR PARTIES AND THE

03:48:26.159 --> 03:48:28.194
BRIDESMAID'S PARTIES IN NEWPORT

03:48:28.261 --> 03:48:29.662
BEACH, WE BECAME A REAL ISSUE

03:48:29.729 --> 03:48:31.097
WHEN I FIRST STARTED GETTING

03:48:31.164 --> 03:48:32.999
INTO THIS AT THE VERY BEGINNING

03:48:33.066 --> 03:48:35.568
THAT WE HAD IN THE CITY, I THINK

03:48:35.635 --> 03:48:37.003
IT WAS FEWER THAN FIVE. MAYBE IT

03:48:37.070 --> 03:48:38.938
WAS 350 SHORT TERM RENTAL

03:48:39.005 --> 03:48:40.406
PERMITS WHERE THE ADDRESS, THE

03:48:40.473 --> 03:48:43.076
NAME, THE ADDRESS OF THE HOME

03:48:43.142 --> 03:48:45.445
WAS ALL IN CITY RECORDS WHEN

03:48:45.511 --> 03:48:47.080
THIS CAME FORWARD AND THE VOLUME

03:48:47.146 --> 03:48:48.548
STARTED THE REQUEST FOR PERMITS,

03:48:48.614 --> 03:48:50.516
WE WANTED TO IDENTIFY THE PERMIT

03:48:50.583 --> 03:48:54.087
NUMBER ON THE ONLINE LISTING,

03:48:54.153 --> 03:48:55.388
AND THAT WAS THE REAL CHALLENGE.

03:48:55.455 --> 03:48:57.090
AND THAT TOOK US AS A CITY

03:48:57.156 --> 03:48:58.458
SEVERAL YEARS WORKING WITH

03:48:58.524 --> 03:48:59.892
AIRBNB. BUT THEY FINALLY CAME

03:48:59.959 --> 03:49:01.561
AROUND AND AS I'M SITTING HERE,

03:49:01.627 --> 03:49:03.396
I WAS TEXTING WITH OUR THE

03:49:03.463 --> 03:49:05.031
CITY'S COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT

03:49:05.098 --> 03:49:06.499
DIRECTOR, WHO'S NOW THE CITY

03:49:06.566 --> 03:49:08.301
MANAGER, AND I SAID, HAVE WE HAD

03:49:08.367 --> 03:49:10.036
ANY LAWSUITS IN NEWPORT BEACH?

03:49:10.103 --> 03:49:11.437
AND WE HAVE NONE. HAVE THERE

03:49:11.504 --> 03:49:13.239
BEEN ANY ISSUES ON PRIVACY AND

03:49:13.306 --> 03:49:15.108
PROVIDING THE PERMIT NUMBER AND

03:49:15.174 --> 03:49:16.776
ANY OTHERS BEFORE WE WERE ABLE

03:49:16.843 --> 03:49:18.277
TO PUT THE PERMIT NUMBER ON THE

03:49:18.344 --> 03:49:20.646
ONLINE FORM, WE HAD TO HIRE A

03:49:20.713 --> 03:49:22.682
CONTRACT WORKER TO GO ON TO THE

03:49:22.748 --> 03:49:24.117
WEBSITES AND LOOK AT ALL THESE

03:49:24.183 --> 03:49:25.518
PROPERTIES IN NEWPORT BEACH, AND

03:49:25.585 --> 03:49:27.186
THEN GO OUT AND SEE WHERE THEY

03:49:27.253 --> 03:49:30.189
ARE TO IDENTIFY THEM AND PUT A

03:49:30.256 --> 03:49:30.823
LITTLE LETTER IN THEIR MAILBOX

03:49:30.890 --> 03:49:31.924
FOR THEIR COMPLIANCE. SO NOW

03:49:31.991 --> 03:49:34.427
IT'S A PROCESS. IT WORKS. WORKS

03:49:34.494 --> 03:49:36.662
PERFECTLY. NO LAWSUITS, NO

03:49:36.729 --> 03:49:38.865
CHALLENGES. WE NOW HAVE THE CITY

03:49:38.931 --> 03:49:40.333
NOW HAS DURING THE PROCESS. IT

03:49:40.399 --> 03:49:42.435
TOOK SEVERAL YEARS. WE PASSED AN

03:49:42.502 --> 03:49:44.170
ORDINANCE, HAD TO GO THROUGH THE

03:49:44.237 --> 03:49:44.837
COASTAL COMMISSION BECAUSE WE'RE

03:49:44.904 --> 03:49:46.772
IN THE COASTAL ZONE. WE WENT

03:49:46.839 --> 03:49:49.308
FROM 350 PERMITS TO 1500

03:49:49.375 --> 03:49:51.077
PERMITS. WE ARE THE LARGEST

03:49:51.144 --> 03:49:53.212
SHORT TERM RENTAL PERMIT CITY IN

03:49:53.279 --> 03:49:54.280
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA,

03:49:54.347 --> 03:49:56.449
PROBABLY IN THE COUNTRY. BUT

03:49:56.516 --> 03:49:58.017
THANK GOODNESS THAT WE HAVE IN

03:49:58.084 --> 03:49:59.519
OUR MINUTES AND YOUR YOUR

03:49:59.585 --> 03:50:01.454
PROPOSED BILL REALLY COVERS ALL

03:50:01.521 --> 03:50:03.356
THE ISSUES THAT WE DID ON OUR

03:50:03.422 --> 03:50:04.524
OWN. WE WOULD HAVE SAVED

03:50:04.590 --> 03:50:06.058
OURSELVES A LOT OF HEADACHES. SO

03:50:06.125 --> 03:50:07.727
FOR THE FUTURE CITIES OUT THERE

03:50:07.793 --> 03:50:09.495
WHO WANT TO DO THIS, WE DO NEED

03:50:09.562 --> 03:50:11.564
A PROCESS. AND WE HAVE HAD NO

03:50:11.631 --> 03:50:14.133
PRIVACY ISSUES. AND IT'S JUST A

03:50:14.200 --> 03:50:16.068
SIMPLE PLACEMENT OR ALLOCATION

03:50:16.135 --> 03:50:17.270
OF SOFTWARE. I'VE BEEN THROUGH

03:50:17.336 --> 03:50:19.005
ALL THIS AND I KNOW WE TALKED

03:50:19.071 --> 03:50:20.873
ABOUT THIS AND I APPRECIATE HOW

03:50:20.940 --> 03:50:22.208
WE WENT THROUGH IT. WE LEARNED A

03:50:22.275 --> 03:50:23.910
LOT, BUT IT'S WORKING WELL. SO I

03:50:23.976 --> 03:50:26.112
WANT TO COMMEND YOU FOR DOING

03:50:26.179 --> 03:50:27.747
IT. AND I HOPE OTHER CITIES CAN

03:50:27.813 --> 03:50:29.882
BENEFIT FROM THIS FRAMEWORK

03:50:29.949 --> 03:50:32.084
BECAUSE IT IS NEEDED. PEOPLE

03:50:32.151 --> 03:50:33.352
JUST NEED GUIDANCE ON HOW TO

03:50:33.419 --> 03:50:34.954
PROTECT THEIR PROPERTY AND THEIR

03:50:35.021 --> 03:50:36.522
NEIGHBORHOODS AND THE SAFETY IN

03:50:36.589 --> 03:50:37.123
THEIR COMMUNITIES. THAT WAS A

03:50:37.190 --> 03:50:38.991
BIG DEAL. PARKING WAS ANOTHER

03:50:39.058 --> 03:50:40.326
BIG DEAL. WE'VE TOUCHED ALL

03:50:40.393 --> 03:50:41.494
THESE ISSUES THAT PEOPLE GET

03:50:41.561 --> 03:50:43.596
UPSET ABOUT. SO THANK YOU. THANK

03:50:43.663 --> 03:50:45.865
YOU, ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAPAN, JUST

03:50:45.932 --> 03:50:48.301
REAL QUICKLY, YOU KNOW, IT'S A

03:50:48.367 --> 03:50:49.302
PRIVILEGE TO DO BUSINESS WITHIN

03:50:49.368 --> 03:50:51.904
A CITY. AND I THINK WITH THAT

03:50:51.971 --> 03:50:53.606
COMES TAX COLLECTION WITH THAT

03:50:53.673 --> 03:50:54.473
PRIVILEGE, BECAUSE THERE ARE

03:50:54.540 --> 03:50:55.474
BURDENS, LIKE WE MENTIONED,

03:50:55.541 --> 03:50:56.909
HEALTH AND SAFETY AND PUBLIC

03:50:56.976 --> 03:50:58.144
SAFETY. MY OWN CITY HAD SOME

03:50:58.211 --> 03:50:59.812
PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUES AS WELL.

03:50:59.879 --> 03:51:01.981
AND I GUESS I JUST I WANT TO SAY

03:51:02.048 --> 03:51:04.417
I KNOW OF NO OTHER MODEL THAT

03:51:04.483 --> 03:51:06.252
OPERATES BY WHICH IT IS SORT OF

03:51:06.319 --> 03:51:09.121
A CATCH ME IF YOU CAN. WITH TAX

03:51:09.188 --> 03:51:11.090
COLLECTION COMES SOME CERTAIN

03:51:11.157 --> 03:51:12.191
PROCEDURES. AND IF THIS ENHANCES

03:51:12.258 --> 03:51:13.626
TAX COLLECTION, I KNOW I'M AS

03:51:13.693 --> 03:51:14.894
I'M LOOKING AROUND THE ROOM, I

03:51:14.961 --> 03:51:17.763
KNOW MANY OF YOU COME FROM LOCAL

03:51:17.830 --> 03:51:22.168
GOVERNMENT AND TAXES ARE, WELL,

03:51:22.235 --> 03:51:23.836
UNPREDICTABLE IN HOW MUCH ONE

03:51:23.903 --> 03:51:25.738
CAN COLLECT. THEY CERTAINLY ARE

03:51:25.805 --> 03:51:27.240
OF ASSISTANCE, ESPECIALLY FOR

03:51:27.306 --> 03:51:28.941
CITIES THAT ARE BURDENED,

03:51:29.008 --> 03:51:31.277
BURDENED, AND I DON'T KNOW OF

03:51:31.344 --> 03:51:32.511
ONE THAT ISN'T SO IN MY MIND. I

03:51:32.578 --> 03:51:33.879
DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE THE

03:51:33.946 --> 03:51:35.881
CATCH ME IF YOU CAN MODEL. I

03:51:35.948 --> 03:51:37.049
THINK TAX COLLECTION IS A PART
