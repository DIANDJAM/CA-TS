00:05:59.392 --> 00:06:01.094
IS OKAY WITH SENATOR WIENER

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.229
BEGIN AS A SUBCOMMITTEE BECAUSE

00:06:03.296 --> 00:06:04.964

TO YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR

00:06:32.925 --> 00:06:35.128
WORKING WITH US. AND I ACCEPT

00:06:35.194 --> 00:06:37.163
THE COMMITTEE'S AMENDMENTS AS

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.633
OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS LAST

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.468
YEAR, AS YOU RECALL, BECAUSE THE

00:06:42.535 --> 00:06:43.402
BILL WENT THROUGH THIS

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:45.204
COMMITTEE, I AUTHORED A

00:06:45.271 --> 00:06:47.173
COMPREHENSIVE AI SAFETY

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.042
LEGISLATION, SENATE BILL 1047.

00:06:50.109 --> 00:06:52.545
THE BILL PASSED WITH BIPARTISAN

00:06:52.612 --> 00:06:54.413
SUPPORT IN BOTH HOUSES OF THE

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.849
LEGISLATURE. AND THE GOVERNOR

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:59.619
DID VETO IT. BUT IN HIS VETO

00:06:59.685 --> 00:07:01.420
MESSAGE, THE GOVERNOR WAS VERY,

00:07:01.487 --> 00:07:04.090
VERY CLEAR THAT THE RISKS THAT

00:07:04.157 --> 00:07:06.993
WE HAD IDENTIFIED IN SB 1047

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:11.531
WERE REAL. THAT THAT IT WAS

00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:13.399
IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE TO TAKE

00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:15.234
ACTION, TO TRY TO GET AHEAD OF

00:07:15.301 --> 00:07:17.103
THOSE RISKS. AND EVEN THOUGH HE

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:18.471
DID NOT AGREE WITH THE

00:07:18.538 --> 00:07:22.108
PARTICULAR APPROACH, IN 1047, HE

00:07:22.175 --> 00:07:23.910
MADE THOSE STATEMENTS AND THEN

00:07:23.976 --> 00:07:25.344
CONVENED AS PART OF HIS VETO

00:07:25.411 --> 00:07:27.814
MESSAGE, A WORKING GROUP WITH

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.650
SOME LEADING MINDS IN THE SPACE

00:07:30.716 --> 00:07:32.151
TO COME BACK WITH

00:07:32.218 --> 00:07:34.720
RECOMMENDATIONS. THAT WORKING

00:07:34.787 --> 00:07:38.257
GROUP, WHICH INCLUDED ONE OF THE

00:07:38.324 --> 00:07:40.593
MOST VOCAL OPPONENTS OF SB 1047

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:43.296
AS WELL, CAME BACK WITH ITS

00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:46.165
FINAL REPORT ABOUT A MONTH AGO,

00:07:46.232 --> 00:07:49.235
AND WE HAD BEEN ADVANCING SB 53

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:50.670
WITH WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS

00:07:50.736 --> 00:07:52.572
AND THE CREATION OF CAL COMPUTE,

00:07:52.638 --> 00:07:56.342
THE PUBLIC CLOUD FOR THE BULK OF

00:07:56.409 --> 00:07:58.110
THIS YEAR. AND AS I INDICATED

00:07:58.177 --> 00:07:59.912
EARLIER IN THE YEAR, WE TOOK A

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:01.280
LOOK AT THE WORKING GROUP

00:08:01.347 --> 00:08:02.215
REPORT, AND THERE WERE A NUMBER

00:08:02.281 --> 00:08:04.283
OF VERY SOLID POLICY

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:05.284
RECOMMENDATIONS IN THAT REPORT.

00:08:05.351 --> 00:08:07.420
AND SO WE THEN INCORPORATED THEM

00:08:07.486 --> 00:08:12.758
INTO SB 53. SO, YOU KNOW, I'M

00:08:12.825 --> 00:08:14.994
VERY PROUD AND NO OFFENSE TO ANY

00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:16.562
COLLEAGUES, BUT I'M VERY PROUD

00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:17.496
TO REPRESENT THE BEATING HEART

00:08:17.563 --> 00:08:20.333
OF AI INNOVATION IN SAN

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:22.134
FRANCISCO. WE HAVE A POWERFUL

00:08:22.201 --> 00:08:25.805
AND GROWING ECOSYSTEM OF AI

00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:28.341
STARTUPS, AND SO MUCH AMAZING

00:08:28.407 --> 00:08:30.476
INNOVATION IS HAPPENING IN OUR

00:08:30.543 --> 00:08:32.011
GREAT CITY, BUT IN OTHER PLACES

00:08:32.078 --> 00:08:34.146
AS WELL. WITH THIS IMPORTANT AND

00:08:34.213 --> 00:08:37.016
POWERFUL TECHNOLOGY IN AI HAS

00:08:37.083 --> 00:08:40.319
THE POTENTIAL TO MAKE THE WORLD

00:08:40.386 --> 00:08:43.089
A BETTER PLACE AND TO IMPROVE

00:08:43.155 --> 00:08:44.857
LIFE FOR HUMANITY, TO HELP US

00:08:44.924 --> 00:08:48.194
CURE DISEASES, TO HELP US TACKLE

00:08:48.261 --> 00:08:49.762
PROBLEMS THAT WE THOUGHT WE

00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:51.063
WEREN'T SURE IF WE COULD TACKLE.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:52.765
WHETHER CLIMATE CHANGE OR SO

00:08:52.832 --> 00:08:56.102
MANY OTHER ISSUES. AND IT IS

00:08:56.168 --> 00:08:58.971
REALLY EXCITING WHAT AI

00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:01.407
PROMISES. BUT AS WITH ANY

00:09:01.474 --> 00:09:04.343
POWERFUL TECHNOLOGY IN ADDITION

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:06.145
TO BENEFITS, THERE ARE RISKS.

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:07.914
AND THAT'S NORMAL. AND IT'S NOT

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.949
ABOUT GETTING ELIMINATING RISKS.

00:09:10.016 --> 00:09:11.284
LIFE IS ABOUT RISK. UNLESS

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:12.985
YOU'RE GOING TO GO LIVE IN A

00:09:13.052 --> 00:09:14.353
BASEMENT SOMEWHERE, AND EVEN

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:15.788
THEN THE CEILING COULD COLLAPSE

00:09:15.855 --> 00:09:17.590
ON YOU. IT'S ABOUT IT'S ABOUT

00:09:17.657 --> 00:09:20.826
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE RISKS

00:09:20.893 --> 00:09:23.095
AND THEN TRYING TO GET AHEAD OF

00:09:23.162 --> 00:09:25.665
THEM IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE

00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:26.999
RISKS. AND I KNOW THROUGH THIS

00:09:27.066 --> 00:09:28.334
COMMITTEE, VARIOUS BILLS HAVE

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:30.169
MOVED THROUGH AROUND DEEPFAKES,

00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:31.637
AROUND ALGORITHMIC

00:09:31.704 --> 00:09:32.872
DISCRIMINATION AND VARIOUS KINDS

00:09:32.939 --> 00:09:35.041
OF RISKS. THE RISKS THAT WE'RE

00:09:35.107 --> 00:09:39.145
FOCUSED ON IN SB 53 ARE MORE

00:09:39.211 --> 00:09:40.613
CATASTROPHIC RISKS, WHETHER

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.515
AROUND CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL,

00:09:42.581 --> 00:09:44.583
RADIOLOGICAL, NUCLEAR WEAPONS,

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:46.752
WHETHER AROUND MAJOR CYBER

00:09:46.819 --> 00:09:50.189
CRIMES, THREATS TO CRITICAL

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:52.591
INFRASTRUCTURE AND SO FORTH. AND

00:09:52.658 --> 00:09:56.495
SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND SB

00:09:56.562 --> 00:09:58.331
1047 WAS A DIFFERENT APPROACH

00:09:58.397 --> 00:10:00.499
HAVING TO DO WITH REQUIRING

00:10:00.566 --> 00:10:02.969
SAFETY TESTING AND LIABILITY.

00:10:03.035 --> 00:10:04.537
THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT

00:10:04.603 --> 00:10:05.938
LIABILITY. IT'S ABOUT

00:10:06.005 --> 00:10:08.474
TRANSPARENCY. AND SO IT WILL

00:10:08.541 --> 00:10:12.311
REQUIRE TRANSPARENCY FOR LARGE,

00:10:12.378 --> 00:10:13.713
LARGE COMPANIES SAFETY AND

00:10:13.779 --> 00:10:16.048
SECURITY PROTOCOLS. OUR GOAL IN

00:10:16.115 --> 00:10:18.818
THIS BILL IS NOT TO SWEEP UP

00:10:18.884 --> 00:10:20.453
STARTUPS. AND SO THAT'S WHY WE

00:10:20.519 --> 00:10:24.290
HAVE TO QUALIFY A LARGE 10 TO 26

00:10:24.357 --> 00:10:28.227
FLOP AS THE SIZE THRESHOLD AND

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:29.595
PER AMENDMENT THAT WE WORKED OUT

00:10:29.662 --> 00:10:32.131
WITH COMMITTEE REQUIRING THAT

00:10:32.198 --> 00:10:35.134
THE COMPANY ALSO HAVE AT LEAST

00:10:35.201 --> 00:10:37.003
$100 MILLION IN ANNUAL REVENUE.

00:10:37.069 --> 00:10:38.270
SO THEY'LL BE REQUIRED TO BE

00:10:38.337 --> 00:10:39.805
TRANSPARENT ABOUT THEIR SAFETY

00:10:39.872 --> 00:10:42.575
AND SECURITY PROTOCOLS AND RISK

00:10:42.641 --> 00:10:43.242
EVALUATIONS. THEY'LL BE ABLE TO

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:46.245
REDACT THOSE TO PROTECT TRADE

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:48.047
SECRETS. THE BILL WILL ALSO

00:10:48.114 --> 00:10:49.882
REQUIRE THAT WHEN THERE IS A

00:10:49.949 --> 00:10:52.018
CRITICAL SAFETY INCIDENT, FOR

00:10:52.084 --> 00:10:53.853
EXAMPLE, LIKE A LOSS OF MODEL

00:10:53.919 --> 00:10:57.123
CONTROL OR MODEL ENABLED, YOU

00:10:57.189 --> 00:10:59.925
KNOW, BIOLOGICAL WEAPON THREATS,

00:10:59.992 --> 00:11:02.328
MAJOR CYBER ATTACKS THAT

00:11:02.395 --> 00:11:04.964
REQUIRING THE DEVELOPER TO

00:11:05.031 --> 00:11:07.833
REPORT TO THE AUTHORITIES WITHIN

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.236
24 HOURS, AND TO FILE A REPORT

00:11:10.302 --> 00:11:12.471
WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WITHIN

00:11:12.538 --> 00:11:14.373
15 DAYS. THE BILL GRANTS THE

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.975
ATTORNEY GENERAL SOME

00:11:16.042 --> 00:11:16.842
FLEXIBILITY TO UPDATE

00:11:16.909 --> 00:11:18.310
THRESHOLDS, AS THIS IS AN

00:11:18.377 --> 00:11:23.582
EVOLVING TECHNOLOGY AND THE ONLY

00:11:23.649 --> 00:11:24.717
ENFORCEMENT LIES WITH THE

00:11:24.784 --> 00:11:27.286
ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR PENALTIES

00:11:27.353 --> 00:11:28.421
FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE ACT AND

00:11:28.487 --> 00:11:31.123
NOT REPORTING, NOT TRANSPARENCY.

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:34.894
THERE'S NO NEW LIABILITY FOR

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.896
HARMS. THIS IS A TRANSPARENCY

00:11:36.962 --> 00:11:44.470
BILL, NOT A LIABILITY BILL. SO I

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:46.005
YOU KNOW, IN ADDITION TO THE

00:11:46.072 --> 00:11:47.039
WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS AND

00:11:47.106 --> 00:11:49.909
THE CREATION OF CAL COMPUTE, THE

00:11:49.975 --> 00:11:51.944
PUBLIC CLOUD TO ENABLE

00:11:52.011 --> 00:11:53.312
RESEARCHERS, STARTUPS TO BE ABLE

00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:55.247
TO HAVE ACCESS TO INCREASINGLY

00:11:55.314 --> 00:11:57.083
EXPENSIVE COMPUTE. AND BY THE

00:11:57.149 --> 00:11:58.217
WAY, WE'VE ALREADY GOTTEN

00:11:58.284 --> 00:11:59.485
POSITIVE SIGNALS FROM SOME FOLKS

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:02.121
IN èC ABOUT NOT ON BEHALF OF

00:12:02.188 --> 00:12:03.956
UC, BUT ON BEHALF OF THEMSELVES

00:12:04.023 --> 00:12:06.258
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF HOSTING

00:12:06.325 --> 00:12:07.226
CAL COMPUTE AT UC, WHICH WOULD

00:12:07.293 --> 00:12:10.830
BE AMAZING. THIS BILL IS VERY,

00:12:10.896 --> 00:12:13.299
VERY SOLID. I DO WANT TO SAY

00:12:13.365 --> 00:12:17.103
THAT WE BECAUSE THE BILL WENT TO

00:12:17.169 --> 00:12:18.871
PRINT WITH THE WORKING GROUP

00:12:18.938 --> 00:12:21.240
RECOMMENDATIONS INCORPORATED

00:12:21.307 --> 00:12:23.375
JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO, AND NOW

00:12:23.442 --> 00:12:25.377
WE'RE NOW WE'RE SEEING

00:12:25.444 --> 00:12:27.079
SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS THAT

00:12:27.146 --> 00:12:29.181
WE'VE ACCEPTED FROM FROM THIS

00:12:29.248 --> 00:12:32.017
COMMITTEE. WE ARE THE ENGAGEMENT

00:12:32.084 --> 00:12:34.186
WITH STAKEHOLDERS, INCLUDING THE

00:12:34.253 --> 00:12:36.088
INDUSTRY, INCLUDING THE

00:12:36.155 --> 00:12:37.923
ADMINISTRATION AND OBVIOUSLY THE

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:38.724
ADMINISTRATION, GIVEN THE VETO

00:12:38.791 --> 00:12:40.559
WE NEED, YOU KNOW, MAKE SURE

00:12:40.626 --> 00:12:42.128
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS GOING

00:12:42.194 --> 00:12:44.130
TO BE ON BOARD WITH WHAT WE'RE

00:12:44.196 --> 00:12:46.565
DOING. THAT ENGAGEMENT HAS BEGUN

00:12:46.632 --> 00:12:49.135
AND IT'S GOING TO ACCELERATE,

00:12:49.201 --> 00:12:50.703
AND I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO

00:12:50.769 --> 00:12:52.738
HAVE A VERY OPEN DOOR. AND WE

00:12:52.805 --> 00:12:56.242
ARE PROACTIVELY SOLICITING INPUT

00:12:56.308 --> 00:12:59.078
FROM LARGE COMPANIES, FROM

00:12:59.145 --> 00:13:02.548
STARTUPS, FROM RESEARCHERS,

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:04.984
ACADEMICS, INVESTORS, ANYONE WHO

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:07.353
HAS FEEDBACK. WE WANT TO KNOW

00:13:07.419 --> 00:13:09.255
THAT FEEDBACK, ANYONE WHO HAS

00:13:09.321 --> 00:13:10.789
IDEAS, WE WANT TO KNOW THOSE

00:13:10.856 --> 00:13:13.859
IDEAS. THIS BILL, YOU KNOW,

00:13:13.926 --> 00:13:15.161
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE

00:13:15.227 --> 00:13:17.563
THAT ENGAGEMENT AND HAVE AN OPEN

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:18.898
DOOR. AND OF COURSE, WE'LL STAY

00:13:18.964 --> 00:13:20.666
VERY CLOSE WITH THE COMMITTEE AS

00:13:20.733 --> 00:13:22.501
WE MOVE FORWARD. AND AS THAT

00:13:22.568 --> 00:13:25.004
FEEDBACK COMES IN. AND I THINK

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:27.106
THIS IS A VERY SOLID BILL IN THE

00:13:27.173 --> 00:13:29.575
STATE THAT IT WILL BE AMENDED IF

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:30.676
IT PASSES OUT OF COMMITTEE

00:13:30.743 --> 00:13:33.245
TODAY. AND I BELIEVE AND MY GOAL

00:13:33.312 --> 00:13:36.081
IS THAT FOR TO PRODUCE A BILL

00:13:36.148 --> 00:13:38.350
ULTIMATELY, THAT WE CAN SEND TO

00:13:38.417 --> 00:13:39.218
THE GOVERNOR THAT WE CAN BE

00:13:39.285 --> 00:13:41.053
PROUD OF AND THE GOVERNOR CAN BE

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.855
PROUD OF, I HOPE SIGNING. SO

00:13:42.922 --> 00:13:45.224
WITH THAT, I RESPECTFULLY ASK

00:13:45.291 --> 00:13:47.193
FOR YOUR VOTE. AND WITH ME TODAY

00:13:47.259 --> 00:13:48.961

00:13:49.028 --> 00:13:51.096
IS CO-FOUNDED EIGHT TECH

00:13:51.163 --> 00:13:52.932
STARTUPS, INCLUDING WRITELY,

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:54.466

THANK YOU. TWO MINUTES EACH WHEN

00:14:02.541 --> 00:14:05.010
YOU'RE READY. OKAY. THANK YOU,

00:14:05.077 --> 00:14:06.812
MADAM CHAIR. AND MEMBERS OF THE

00:14:06.879 --> 00:14:07.813
COMMITTEE FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.882
TO TESTIFY TODAY. SO YEAH, MY

00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:12.117
NAME IS STEVE NEWMAN. I'M A

00:14:12.184 --> 00:14:13.886
SOFTWARE ENTREPRENEUR. I'VE SOLD

00:14:13.953 --> 00:14:15.788
COMPANIES TO GOOGLE, APPLE

00:14:15.854 --> 00:14:17.656
SENTINEL ONE. I'M NOW PRESIDENT

00:14:17.723 --> 00:14:19.358
OF THE GOLDEN GATE INSTITUTE FOR

00:14:19.425 --> 00:14:21.794
AI. BUT HERE IN A PERSONAL

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:25.497
CAPACITY, I LEARNED TO CODE AT

00:14:25.564 --> 00:14:26.432
AGE EIGHT, WHICH MEANS I'VE BEEN

00:14:26.498 --> 00:14:30.569
IN TECH SINCE 1975. I PLAYED MY

00:14:30.636 --> 00:14:32.438
OWN SMALL PART. WE BUILT GOOGLE

00:14:32.504 --> 00:14:33.706
DOCS IN THE ATTIC OVER MY

00:14:33.772 --> 00:14:36.442
GARAGE, BUT THIS IS THE MOST

00:14:36.508 --> 00:14:38.544
EXCITING. GENERATIVE AI IS THE

00:14:38.611 --> 00:14:39.878
MOST EXCITING TECHNOLOGY I'VE

00:14:39.945 --> 00:14:43.382
SEEN. I'VE ALSO NEVER SEEN ANY

00:14:43.449 --> 00:14:44.350
TECHNOLOGY LESS WELL UNDERSTOOD

00:14:44.416 --> 00:14:45.818
BY THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BUILDING

00:14:45.884 --> 00:14:49.154
IT. ANY ANY AI DEVELOPER WILL

00:14:49.221 --> 00:14:50.856
TELL YOU THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING

00:14:50.923 --> 00:14:52.658
HERE IS NOT IS AS MUCH ALCHEMY

00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:55.628
AS ENGINEERING. SILICON VALLEY

00:14:55.694 --> 00:14:58.130
WAS BUILT ON INNOVATION, AND

00:14:58.197 --> 00:14:59.965
INNOVATION IS BUILT ON

00:15:00.032 --> 00:15:01.367
INFORMATION, BUT WE'RE LACKING

00:15:01.433 --> 00:15:03.235
INFORMATION TODAY. GENERATIVE AI

00:15:03.302 --> 00:15:05.671
IS SO POWERFUL, EVOLVING SO

00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:07.473
RAPIDLY, AND FRANKLY SO

00:15:07.539 --> 00:15:09.642
MYSTERIOUS THAT WE CAN'T PREDICT

00:15:09.708 --> 00:15:11.377
WHEN CATASTROPHIC RISKS WILL

00:15:11.443 --> 00:15:14.680
OCCUR. THERE ARE WARNING SIGNS.

00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:15.981
OPENAI'S OWN PREPAREDNESS

00:15:16.048 --> 00:15:17.850
FRAMEWORK CITES SYSTEMS THAT

00:15:17.916 --> 00:15:20.486
WILL SOON HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO

00:15:20.552 --> 00:15:22.187
CREATE MEANINGFUL RISK OF SEVERE

00:15:22.254 --> 00:15:25.090
HARM, OF SEVERE HARM. THAT'S WHY

00:15:25.157 --> 00:15:26.959
GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S POLICY WORKING

00:15:27.026 --> 00:15:28.294
GROUP CALLED FOR IMMEDIATE

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.162
ACTION. THIS BILL'S REPORTING

00:15:30.229 --> 00:15:31.664
REQUIREMENTS AND WHISTLEBLOWER

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:33.699
PROTECTIONS WILL PROVIDE THE

00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:35.167
INFORMATION WE NEED TO PROCEED

00:15:35.234 --> 00:15:38.437
WITH CONFIDENCE. I KNOW A GOOD

00:15:38.504 --> 00:15:39.571
TECHNICAL COMPROMISE WHEN I SEE

00:15:39.638 --> 00:15:40.606
IT. THAT DOESN'T MEAN BOTH SIDES

00:15:40.673 --> 00:15:42.775
ARE UNHAPPY. IT MEANS YOU'VE PUT

00:15:42.841 --> 00:15:44.910
IN THE WORK TO GET WHAT YOU NEED

00:15:44.977 --> 00:15:47.079
AT MINIMAL COST. AS YOU'VE JUST

00:15:47.146 --> 00:15:48.480
HEARD FROM SENATOR WIENER, THE

00:15:48.547 --> 00:15:49.782
WORKING GROUP AND THE AUTHORS OF

00:15:49.848 --> 00:15:51.383
THIS BILL HAVE DONE THAT HARD

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:53.052
WORK. WE SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE

00:15:53.118 --> 00:15:54.720
OF THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SAFELY

00:15:54.787 --> 00:15:56.388
ADVANCE THIS ONCE IN A

00:15:56.455 --> 00:15:57.990
GENERATION TECHNOLOGY. FOR THESE

00:15:58.057 --> 00:16:00.025
REASONS, I URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF

00:16:00.092 --> 00:16:02.628
THIS CRITICAL LEGISLATION. THANK

00:16:02.695 --> 00:16:06.498

TERRY LEE WITH ECONOMIC SECURITY

00:16:09.468 --> 00:16:10.536
CALIFORNIA ACTION, PROUD

00:16:10.602 --> 00:16:11.470
CO-SPONSOR OF THE BILL. AND OF

00:16:11.537 --> 00:16:13.205
COURSE, I WANT TO THANK THE

00:16:13.272 --> 00:16:14.273
SENATOR FOR HIS CONTINUED

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:15.441
LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. I'M

00:16:15.507 --> 00:16:17.076
GOING TO TALK FOR A MINUTE ABOUT

00:16:17.142 --> 00:16:19.011
CAL COMPUTE, WHICH WOULD, AS YOU

00:16:19.078 --> 00:16:20.079
KNOW, ESTABLISH A CONSORTIUM TO

00:16:20.145 --> 00:16:21.613
DEVELOP A PUBLICLY OWNED AND

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:22.881
OPERATED CLOUD COMPUTING CLUSTER

00:16:22.948 --> 00:16:24.583
SO THAT WE CAN EXPAND AND

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:25.918
DEMOCRATIZE ACCESS TO THIS

00:16:25.984 --> 00:16:28.153
CRITICAL AI INFRASTRUCTURE. CAL

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:30.089
COMPUTE FIRST ADDRESSES THE

00:16:30.155 --> 00:16:31.323
PROBLEM OF EXTREME CONCENTRATION

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:33.559
OF COMPUTE POWER IN A FEW HANDS.

00:16:33.625 --> 00:16:35.094
COMPUTE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.729
FACTOR IN ENABLING OR LIMITING

00:16:36.795 --> 00:16:38.497
LIMITING AI INNOVATION. IT'S

00:16:38.564 --> 00:16:39.298
EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE AND

00:16:39.365 --> 00:16:40.999
CONTROLLED BY A TINY NUMBER OF

00:16:41.066 --> 00:16:42.534
COMPANIES WHO HAVE AN OUTSIZED

00:16:42.601 --> 00:16:43.769
SAY IN WHAT'S DEVELOPED AND WHOM

00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:45.504
IT BENEFITS. MEANWHILE, STARTUPS

00:16:45.571 --> 00:16:47.172
AND EVEN MAJOR ACADEMIC

00:16:47.239 --> 00:16:48.607
INSTITUTIONS LAG BEHIND. FOR

00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:50.442
EXAMPLE, STANFORD ONLY HAS 300

00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:51.610
OF THESE SPECIALIZED CHIPS

00:16:51.677 --> 00:16:54.480
NEEDED FOR AI. MICROSOFT HAS 1.8

00:16:54.546 --> 00:16:55.881
MILLION. DISPARITY AFFECTS

00:16:55.948 --> 00:16:57.316
CAREER PATHWAYS, TOO, WITH

00:16:57.383 --> 00:16:59.084
CALIFORNIA EDUCATED TECH TALENT

00:16:59.151 --> 00:17:00.519
LURED AWAY FROM SOLVING OUR

00:17:00.586 --> 00:17:01.353
PRESSING PUBLIC PROBLEMS BECAUSE

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:02.721
THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS FRANKLY,

00:17:02.788 --> 00:17:04.089
MORE DYNAMIC, THIS IS A

00:17:04.156 --> 00:17:06.158
SIGNIFICANT LOSS. SECOND, CAL

00:17:06.225 --> 00:17:07.359
COMPUTE WOULD CONTINUE

00:17:07.426 --> 00:17:08.727
CALIFORNIA'S LEGACY OF

00:17:08.794 --> 00:17:09.895
TRANSFORMATIVE PUBLIC INVESTMENT

00:17:09.962 --> 00:17:11.697
IN CUTTING EDGE RESEARCH

00:17:11.764 --> 00:17:13.065
INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS THE

00:17:13.132 --> 00:17:14.466
PIONEERING STEM CELL RESEARCH

00:17:14.533 --> 00:17:15.734
CENTER AND OUR WORLD CLASS

00:17:15.801 --> 00:17:17.403
NATIONAL LABS. WE ARE THE HOME

00:17:17.469 --> 00:17:19.304
OF AI, AND WE SHOULD BE LEADING

00:17:19.371 --> 00:17:21.306
ON THIS Tð. NEW YORK IS ALREADY

00:17:21.373 --> 00:17:22.608
UNDERWAY AND SHOWING WHAT'S

00:17:22.674 --> 00:17:24.376
POSSIBLE AFTER INVESTING IN A

00:17:24.443 --> 00:17:25.677
CONSORTIUM LAST YEAR, EMPIRE AI

00:17:25.744 --> 00:17:27.980
HAS 200 PLUS RESEARCHERS BUSY

00:17:28.046 --> 00:17:29.348
BUILDING CLIMATE MODELS AND

00:17:29.415 --> 00:17:31.183
IMPROVING CANCER DIAGNOSES.

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:32.151
CALIFORNIA SHOULD JOIN WITH THEM

00:17:32.217 --> 00:17:34.086
AND SHOW THE WORLD HOW TO SPUR

00:17:34.153 --> 00:17:35.621
INNOVATION IN A CLIMATE OF

00:17:35.687 --> 00:17:37.089
TRANSPARENCY AND SAFETY. AND

00:17:37.156 --> 00:17:38.457
FINALLY, CAL COMPUTE IS POPULAR,

00:17:38.524 --> 00:17:39.792
AS WE'VE HEARD, IT RECEIVED

00:17:39.858 --> 00:17:41.160
NEARLY UNIVERSAL SUPPORT AS PART

00:17:41.226 --> 00:17:43.128
OF LAST YEAR'S 1047, AND SINCE

00:17:43.195 --> 00:17:45.197
THEN IT WAS NAMED AS THE TOP

00:17:45.264 --> 00:17:46.265
RECOMMENDATION IN THE LITTLE

00:17:46.331 --> 00:17:47.299
HOOVER COMMISSION'S REPORT ON

00:17:47.366 --> 00:17:48.967

CALIFORNIA ACHIEVING A DEGREE OF

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:55.874
TECHNOLOGICAL INDEPENDENCE,

00:17:55.941 --> 00:17:57.709
WHICH SEEMS MORE IMPORTANT THAN

00:17:57.776 --> 00:17:59.344
EVER. FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS,

00:19:26.365 --> 00:19:28.267
A GENERAL MATTER, OF COURSE, WE

00:19:28.333 --> 00:19:29.167
APPRECIATE AND SHARE IN YOUR

00:19:29.234 --> 00:19:30.469
GOAL IN ENSURING THE SAFE AND

00:19:30.536 --> 00:19:32.104
RESPONSIBLE DEVELOPMENT OF AI.

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:33.272
OUR CONCERN IS IN HOW TO BEST

00:19:33.338 --> 00:19:35.941
GET THERE. AS WRITTEN, SB 53

00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:36.842
PRESENTS SOME CHALLENGES THAT

00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:38.176
COULD HINDER INNOVATION AND MAY

00:19:38.243 --> 00:19:39.912
NOT FULLY ADDRESS THE TRUE RISKS

00:19:39.978 --> 00:19:41.179
OF AI. WE ARE STILL REVIEWING

00:19:41.246 --> 00:19:43.081
THE BILL AND ITS PROPOSED

00:19:43.148 --> 00:19:44.683
AMENDMENTS AND DISCUSSING THE

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:45.417
IMPLICATIONS WITH OUR MEMBERS,

00:19:45.484 --> 00:19:47.286
BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL AREAS WE

00:19:47.352 --> 00:19:48.787
HOPE THAT ADDITIONAL WORK CAN BE

00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:50.756
DONE. FIRST, THE BILL FOCUSES ON

00:19:50.822 --> 00:19:52.591
DEVELOPER SIZE RATHER THAN MODEL

00:19:52.658 --> 00:19:54.326
RISK. SMALL ENTITIES CAN BUILD

00:19:54.393 --> 00:19:56.261
ON MODELS THAT ARE JUST AS

00:19:56.328 --> 00:19:57.329
CAPABLE, AND POTENTIALLY AS

00:19:57.396 --> 00:19:58.664
RISKY AS THOSE FROM LARGE

00:19:58.730 --> 00:19:59.965
DEVELOPERS. GOVERNOR NEWSOM

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:01.166
FLAGGED THIS IN HIS VETO LAST

00:20:01.233 --> 00:20:04.202
YEAR. SIZES IN A RELIABLE RISK

00:20:04.269 --> 00:20:06.071
FOR PROXY FOR RISK, MAKING BOTH

00:20:06.138 --> 00:20:08.373
THE BILL BOTH TOO BROAD AND TOO

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.474
NARROW. SECOND, THE BILL'S

00:20:09.541 --> 00:20:10.576
DEFINITIONS OF CATASTROPHIC

00:20:10.642 --> 00:20:11.910
RISK, CRITICAL SAFETY INCIDENTS

00:20:11.977 --> 00:20:13.211
AND DANGEROUS CAPABILITIES

00:20:13.278 --> 00:20:14.246
SHOULD BE SIMPLIFIED AND

00:20:14.313 --> 00:20:15.914
NARROWED. THIRDLY, DETAILED

00:20:15.981 --> 00:20:17.115
DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS POSE

00:20:17.182 --> 00:20:18.884
SIGNIFICANT SECURITY RISKS BY

00:20:18.951 --> 00:20:20.252
MAKING DEVELOPERS INTERNAL

00:20:20.319 --> 00:20:21.320
PROTOCOLS VULNERABLE TO BAD

00:20:21.386 --> 00:20:22.454
ACTORS, WE ASK THAT THE

00:20:22.521 --> 00:20:23.589
REQUIREMENTS BE ADJUSTED TO

00:20:23.655 --> 00:20:25.924
MITIGATE RISKS AND SIMPLIFY

00:20:25.991 --> 00:20:27.693
COMPLIANCE. WE ALSO SUGGEST THAT

00:20:27.759 --> 00:20:29.061
THE ENFORCEMENT SHOULD FOCUS ON

00:20:29.127 --> 00:20:30.162
MATERIAL VIOLATIONS AND INCLUDE

00:20:30.228 --> 00:20:32.064
A RIGHT TO CURE. DEVELOPERS

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:33.332
SHOULD NOT FACE LIABILITY FOR

00:20:33.398 --> 00:20:34.399
GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS TO MEET

00:20:34.466 --> 00:20:36.535
PAPERWORK REQUIREMENTS,

00:20:36.602 --> 00:20:37.135
ESPECIALLY WHEN DEALING WITH

00:20:37.202 --> 00:20:38.637
HIGHLY COMPLEX AND RAPIDLY

00:20:38.704 --> 00:20:40.405
CHANGING SCIENTIFIC AND POLICY

00:20:40.472 --> 00:20:41.540
MATTERS. WITH REGARD TO RECENT

00:20:41.607 --> 00:20:42.674
AMENDMENTS, AGAIN, WE ARE

00:20:42.741 --> 00:20:44.042
CONTINUING TO REVIEW THEM. SOME

00:20:44.109 --> 00:20:45.577
OF OUR MEMBERS HAVE FLAGGED

00:20:45.644 --> 00:20:46.311
CONCERNS, I CAN SAY, ON THE

00:20:46.378 --> 00:20:48.013
AUDIT PROVISION WE ARE HEAVILY

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.581
CONCERNED. COST ASIDE, NO ONE

00:20:49.648 --> 00:20:50.482
UNDERSTANDS THIS TECHNOLOGY

00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:52.384
BETTER THAN OUR OWN DEVELOPERS.

00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:54.753
SO CREATING A COTTAGE INDUSTRY

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:55.721
FOR AUDITING DOESN'T ENHANCE

00:20:55.787 --> 00:20:58.090
SAFETY FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE.

00:20:58.156 --> 00:21:00.425
MOREOVER, WE ALSO DO WANT TO

00:21:00.492 --> 00:21:01.293
CLARIFY THAT FOR THE RECORD, THE

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.195
RAISE ACT THAT WAS ACTUALLY

00:21:03.261 --> 00:21:04.329
PASSED DID NOT INCLUDE THE THIRD

00:21:04.396 --> 00:21:06.765
PARTY AUDIT REQUIREMENT. SO

00:21:06.832 --> 00:21:08.767
AGAIN, WE JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE

00:21:08.834 --> 00:21:10.569
THAT WE DO LOOK FORWARD WORKING

00:21:10.636 --> 00:21:11.336
WITH THE AUTHOR. WE THINK THAT

00:21:11.403 --> 00:21:14.272
THERE IS SOME PLACE TO GO ON

00:21:14.339 --> 00:21:14.873
SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND ARE

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.274
LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH

00:21:16.341 --> 00:21:17.442
NOT JUST THE AUTHOR BUT ALSO THE

00:21:17.509 --> 00:21:19.978
COMMITTEE. SO WE THANK YOU.

00:21:20.045 --> 00:21:24.883
THANK YOU. AS WELL. PRACTICED.

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:27.319
SHE LEFT YOU ALL TWO MINUTES.

00:21:27.386 --> 00:21:28.920
OKAY. GOOD MORNING, CHAIR

00:21:28.987 --> 00:21:30.222
MEMBERS ROBERT BOYKIN WITH

00:21:30.288 --> 00:21:32.157
TECHNET HERE TODAY. RESPECTFULLY

00:21:32.224 --> 00:21:34.092
OPPOSED TO SB 53 UNLESS IT IS

00:21:34.159 --> 00:21:35.894
AMENDED. TECHNET APPRECIATES THE

00:21:35.961 --> 00:21:37.095
SENATOR'S CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT

00:21:37.162 --> 00:21:38.864
ON SB 53 AND ITS COMMITMENT TO

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:40.198
RESPONSIBLE AI GOVERNANCE. WE

00:21:40.265 --> 00:21:41.833
SUPPORT THE GOAL OF PROMOTING

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:43.201
TRANSPARENCY AND SAFETY IN THE

00:21:43.268 --> 00:21:44.936
DEVELOPMENT OF ADVANCED AI

00:21:45.003 --> 00:21:46.138
SYSTEMS. WE RECOGNIZE THE BILL

00:21:46.204 --> 00:21:48.240
IS INTENDED AS A WORKING DRAFT.

00:21:48.306 --> 00:21:50.375
THAT SAID, WE DO HAVE A FEW KEY

00:21:50.442 --> 00:21:51.309
CONCERNS WE'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT.

00:21:51.376 --> 00:21:52.611
FIRST, THE BILL APPLIES TO ALL

00:21:52.678 --> 00:21:54.146
MODELS DEVELOPED BY A COMPANY.

00:21:54.212 --> 00:21:55.981
ONCE THAT COMPANY EXCEEDS A

00:21:56.048 --> 00:21:56.515
SPECIFIC THRESHOLD, THIS

00:21:56.581 --> 00:21:57.616
APPROACH DOESN'T REFLECT THE

00:21:57.683 --> 00:22:00.152
ACTUAL RISK POSED BY INDIVIDUAL

00:22:00.218 --> 00:22:01.486
MODELS, AND MAY INTENTIONALLY

00:22:01.553 --> 00:22:03.422
REGULATE SMALL, LOW RISK TOOLS

00:22:03.488 --> 00:22:05.190
SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WERE CREATED

00:22:05.257 --> 00:22:06.758
BY A LARGE DEVELOPER. WE BELIEVE

00:22:06.825 --> 00:22:08.694
IT WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE TO

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:09.795
FOCUS ON CAPABILITIES AND RISK

00:22:09.861 --> 00:22:11.329
OF THE MODEL ITSELF, NOT JUST

00:22:11.396 --> 00:22:13.031
THE SIZE OF THE COMPANY BEHIND

00:22:13.098 --> 00:22:14.032
IT. SECOND, SOME OF THE

00:22:14.099 --> 00:22:15.200
REPORTING AND DISCLOSURE

00:22:15.267 --> 00:22:16.635
REQUIREMENTS, SUCH AS THOSE

00:22:16.702 --> 00:22:17.202
RELATED TO CYBER SECURITY

00:22:17.269 --> 00:22:18.704
PROTOCOLS, INTERNAL TESTING, OR

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:20.238
THE REPRODUCTION OF RISK

00:22:20.305 --> 00:22:21.206
ASSESSMENTS RAISE SERIOUS

00:22:21.273 --> 00:22:22.841
CONCERNS ABOUT EXPOSING TRADE

00:22:22.908 --> 00:22:24.976
SECRETS OR INCREASING SECURITY

00:22:25.043 --> 00:22:26.044
VULNERABILITIES. WE ENCOURAGE

00:22:26.111 --> 00:22:27.379
KEEPING DISCLOSURES HIGH LEVEL

00:22:27.446 --> 00:22:28.780
ENOUGH TO SUPPORT OVERSIGHT, BUT

00:22:28.847 --> 00:22:30.315
NOT SO DETAILED THAT THE

00:22:30.382 --> 00:22:32.017
ADVERSARIAL ACTORS COULD EXPLOIT

00:22:32.084 --> 00:22:33.251
THEM. FINALLY, MANY COMPANIES

00:22:33.318 --> 00:22:35.620
ARE ALREADY INVESTING HEAVILY IN

00:22:35.687 --> 00:22:37.289
ROBUST SAFETY SAFETY PRACTICES

00:22:37.355 --> 00:22:39.791
LIKE RED TEAMING AND POST

00:22:39.858 --> 00:22:40.826
POST-DEPLOYMENT MONITORING. WE

00:22:40.892 --> 00:22:43.161
WANT TO ENSURE THAT SB 53

00:22:43.228 --> 00:22:44.062
STRENGTHENS THAT CULTURE OF

00:22:44.129 --> 00:22:45.397
SAFETY. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ADVERSE

00:22:45.464 --> 00:22:46.932
EVENT REPORTING FRAMEWORK MAY BE

00:22:46.998 --> 00:22:48.567
BETTER SUITED FOR NATIONAL

00:22:48.633 --> 00:22:49.801
COORDINATION GIVEN THE

00:22:49.868 --> 00:22:52.137
CROSS-SECTOR AND CROSS-BORDER

00:22:52.204 --> 00:22:54.039
IMPLICATIONS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO

00:22:54.106 --> 00:22:55.574
WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR TO HELP

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.309
ENSURE THAT THIS BILL IS BOTH

00:22:57.375 --> 00:22:58.043
EFFECTIVE AND PRACTICAL IN

00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:59.444
MEETING ITS IMPORTANT GOALS.

00:22:59.511 --> 00:23:00.846
HOWEVER, FOR THE REASONS STATED,

00:23:00.912 --> 00:23:03.415
WE REMAIN OPPOSED. SB 53. THANK

00:23:03.482 --> 00:23:06.318
YOU FOR YOUR TIME. TODAY. I

00:23:06.384 --> 00:23:08.386
TURNED MY MIC OFF. THANK YOU.

00:23:08.453 --> 00:23:09.488
ANYONE ELSE HERE IN OPPOSITION

00:23:09.554 --> 00:23:11.790
TO THIS BILL COMING UP? NAME,

00:23:11.857 --> 00:23:13.725
ORGANIZATION AND POSITION. THANK

00:23:13.792 --> 00:23:18.830
YOU. ROBERT SINGLETON OF CHAMBER

00:23:18.897 --> 00:23:21.767
OF PROGRESS. WE LOVE CAL COMPUTE

00:23:21.833 --> 00:23:23.335
BUT REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE REST

00:23:23.401 --> 00:23:24.870
OF THE BILL. THANK YOU. THE

00:23:24.936 --> 00:23:26.371
COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY

00:23:26.438 --> 00:23:27.472
ASSOCIATION. WE'D LIKE TO ALIGN

00:23:27.539 --> 00:23:29.107
OUR COMMENTS WITH TECHNET AND

00:23:29.174 --> 00:23:31.510
CAL CHAMBER. THANK YOU. ALEX

00:23:31.576 --> 00:23:32.544
TORRES, ON BEHALF OF THE BAY

00:23:32.611 --> 00:23:33.879
AREA COUNCIL, IN RESPECTFUL

00:23:33.945 --> 00:23:35.514
OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME. THANK

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:37.449
YOU, SENATOR. I THINK THAT IS A

00:23:37.516 --> 00:23:39.484
SHORTER LINE THAN WE HAD LAST

00:23:39.551 --> 00:23:42.554
YEAR. SO KUDOS TO YOU BRINGING

00:23:42.621 --> 00:23:44.055
IT BACK TO THE DAIS. ASSEMBLY

00:23:44.122 --> 00:23:47.492
MEMBER IRWIN, THANK YOU VERY

00:23:47.559 --> 00:23:48.393
MUCH, CHAIR. AND I DIDN'T SEE

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:52.697
YOU OVER THERE. I WAS HIDING I

00:23:52.764 --> 00:23:55.734
WANT TO THANK YOU, SENATOR, FOR

00:23:55.801 --> 00:23:57.435
YOUR DEDICATION. WE ALL KNOW

00:23:57.502 --> 00:23:59.104
YOU'RE HOW HARD WORKING YOU ARE

00:23:59.171 --> 00:24:02.107
AND TRYING TO SECURE THAT, THAT

00:24:02.174 --> 00:24:04.943
I IS SAFE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS.

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:07.846
BUT I DO NEED TO IMPRESS UPON

00:24:07.913 --> 00:24:09.681
YOU THAT I HOPE YOU TAKE THE

00:24:09.748 --> 00:24:11.583
NEXT TWO MONTHS OR SO TO WORK

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:14.386
WITH THE OPPOSITION AND MAKE

00:24:14.452 --> 00:24:18.223
SURE THAT YOU IRON OUT THE

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:20.058
DIFFERENCES YOU HAVE. THIS IS I

00:24:20.125 --> 00:24:22.127
KNOW YOU WERE WAITING FOR THE

00:24:22.194 --> 00:24:24.362
REPORT TO COME OUT, BUT ASKING

00:24:24.429 --> 00:24:28.300
THE COMMITTEE TO BASICALLY HAVE,

00:24:28.366 --> 00:24:30.569
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS ONE

00:24:30.635 --> 00:24:32.304
WEEK TO DIGEST ALL THIS MATERIAL

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:34.806
WAS A LOT. AND I DO COMMEND THE

00:24:34.873 --> 00:24:36.775
COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIR FOR

00:24:36.842 --> 00:24:38.476
WORKING SO DILIGENTLY THAT THE

00:24:38.543 --> 00:24:40.478
ANALYSIS IS 53 PAGES. I THINK

00:24:40.545 --> 00:24:42.747
THAT'S A RECORD AND AN

00:24:42.814 --> 00:24:43.582
INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF WORK. BUT

00:24:43.648 --> 00:24:46.418
IT DOES POINT OUT TO I THINK

00:24:46.484 --> 00:24:48.019
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK STILL TO

00:24:48.086 --> 00:24:52.324
WORK OUT A LOT OF WORK TO LOOK

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:54.326
AT WHAT THE OPPOSITION IS

00:24:54.392 --> 00:24:56.061
SAYING. AND THAT MAKES SURE THAT

00:24:56.127 --> 00:24:57.429
YOU, THAT YOU DEAL WITH THE

00:24:57.495 --> 00:24:58.563
ISSUES. ONE OF THE REASONS I

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:00.065
DIDN'T VOTE FOR YOUR BILL LAST

00:25:00.131 --> 00:25:02.400
YEAR WAS WE'RE WE WERE YOU KNOW,

00:25:02.467 --> 00:25:03.735
WE'RE CONCERNED IN CALIFORNIA

00:25:03.802 --> 00:25:06.137
THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT BALANCE

00:25:06.204 --> 00:25:07.505
BETWEEN SAFETY AND DRIVING OUT

00:25:07.572 --> 00:25:09.341
INNOVATION. AND I THINK THAT THE

00:25:09.407 --> 00:25:11.176
GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE WAS THE SAME.

00:25:11.243 --> 00:25:13.278
SO I WANT TO SEE WHAT THE BILL

00:25:13.345 --> 00:25:16.214
LOOKS LIKE WHEN IT GETS TO THE

00:25:16.281 --> 00:25:17.482
FLOOR. HOPEFULLY I CAN STILL

00:25:17.549 --> 00:25:19.517
SUPPORT IT. I'M GOING TO BE

00:25:19.584 --> 00:25:20.685
SUPPORTING IT TODAY. BUT

00:25:20.752 --> 00:25:22.053
OBVIOUSLY I THINK THAT YOU YOU

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:24.155
DO NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT THE

00:25:24.222 --> 00:25:26.424
GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE IS TO MAKE

00:25:26.491 --> 00:25:27.626
SURE THAT HE CAN SUPPORT IT.

00:25:27.692 --> 00:25:32.797
ALSO. YES, THANK YOU FOR THAT.

00:25:32.864 --> 00:25:35.267
AND WE'RE ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED

00:25:35.333 --> 00:25:37.068
TO CONTINUE DIALOG WITH THE

00:25:37.135 --> 00:25:39.237
OPPOSITION AS AS THE FOLKS IN ON

00:25:39.304 --> 00:25:41.640
IN THE INDUSTRY KNOW, WE HAVE

00:25:41.706 --> 00:25:45.410
BEEN INCESSANTLY PESTERING THEM

00:25:45.477 --> 00:25:46.845
FOR MORE AND MORE. YOU KNOW,

00:25:46.912 --> 00:25:48.246
PROPOSALS AND FEEDBACKS FOR A

00:25:48.313 --> 00:25:51.049
WHILE NOW. AND WE LOOK FORWARD

00:25:51.116 --> 00:25:52.484
TO SEEING THAT AND SOME OF THE

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:54.719
ISSUES THAT THE OPPOSITION

00:25:54.786 --> 00:25:55.854
RAISED ARE ONES THAT WE, YOU

00:25:55.921 --> 00:25:57.989
KNOW, SEEM LIKE WE CAN

00:25:58.056 --> 00:26:00.091
ABSOLUTELY HAVE A CONVERSATION

00:26:00.158 --> 00:26:01.159
ABOUT. I KNOW THERE'S A

00:26:01.226 --> 00:26:02.027
DISAGREEMENT ABOUT AUDITS, AND

00:26:02.093 --> 00:26:04.496
WE TALKED ABOUT THAT LAST NIGHT

00:26:04.562 --> 00:26:08.466
IN JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. AND

00:26:08.533 --> 00:26:10.268
YEAH, WE ALSO WE TRIED YOU KNOW,

00:26:10.335 --> 00:26:11.503
WE MADE CLEAR EARLIER IN THE

00:26:11.569 --> 00:26:13.505
YEAR THAT WE WERE AWAITING THE

00:26:13.571 --> 00:26:15.540
REPORT. WE ACTUALLY EVEN PUT OUT

00:26:15.607 --> 00:26:16.241
AN OUTLINE OF WHAT WE WERE

00:26:16.308 --> 00:26:18.677
LOOKING AT VERY QUICKLY AFTER

00:26:18.743 --> 00:26:21.012
THE REPORT CAME OUT. SO WE'VE I

00:26:21.079 --> 00:26:22.814
APPRECIATE ACKNOWLEDGING THE

00:26:22.881 --> 00:26:24.215
CHALLENGING TIMING THAT WE'RE

00:26:24.282 --> 00:26:26.318
IN, BUT WE'VE BEEN REALLY TRYING

00:26:26.384 --> 00:26:27.886
TO BE AS TRANSPARENT AS

00:26:27.953 --> 00:26:28.620
POSSIBLE, UNDERSTANDING THAT

00:26:28.687 --> 00:26:31.356
THIS IS A VERY IT'S A TIME

00:26:31.423 --> 00:26:32.891
SENSITIVE SITUATION. CONGRESS IS

00:26:32.958 --> 00:26:35.160
DOING NOTHING, LITERALLY

00:26:35.226 --> 00:26:36.861
NOTHING. CONGRESS HAS YET TO

00:26:36.928 --> 00:26:38.930
PASS A PRIVACY DATA PRIVACY LAW,

00:26:38.997 --> 00:26:40.699
WHICH I THINK IS ABSOLUTELY

00:26:40.765 --> 00:26:41.633
EMBARRASSING FOR THE UNITED

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:43.134
STATES OF AMERICA THAT WE DO NOT

00:26:43.201 --> 00:26:45.770
HAVE A FEDERAL DATA PRIVACY LAW

00:26:45.837 --> 00:26:47.272
IN 2025. IT'S ACTUALLY

00:26:47.339 --> 00:26:51.276
DESPICABLE. AND THEY JUST TRIED

00:26:51.343 --> 00:26:54.913
TO BAN STATES FROM, YOU KNOW,

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:56.281
PROTECTING CHILDREN, YOU KNOW,

00:26:56.348 --> 00:26:59.084
KIDS FROM DEEPFAKE KIDDY PORN.

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:01.586
AND THERE WERE, UNFORTUNATELY,

00:27:01.653 --> 00:27:03.254
INDUSTRY ACTORS THAT WERE

00:27:03.321 --> 00:27:05.190
HELPING PUSH THE FEDERAL

00:27:05.256 --> 00:27:07.025
MORATORIUM PROPOSAL THAT WAS

00:27:07.092 --> 00:27:09.194
FORTUNATELY KILLED. SO I THINK

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:10.829
IT'S ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT FOR

00:27:10.895 --> 00:27:12.130
CALIFORNIA TO ACT. AND WE DO

00:27:12.197 --> 00:27:14.099
LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH

00:27:14.165 --> 00:27:15.066
WITH A BROAD SPECTRUM OF

00:27:15.133 --> 00:27:17.135
STAKEHOLDERS. SO THANK YOU.

00:27:17.202 --> 00:27:19.371
THANK YOU, SENATOR. MADAM VICE

00:27:19.437 --> 00:27:21.473
CHAIR. THANK YOU. CHAIR.

00:27:21.539 --> 00:27:22.841
SENATOR. YES, YOU YOU HAVE

00:27:22.907 --> 00:27:25.210
BECOME THE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT

00:27:25.276 --> 00:27:27.645
AS WELL AS THE CHAIR. HERE. LET

00:27:27.712 --> 00:27:29.114
ME ASK YOU A COUPLE OF SERIES OF

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:30.281
QUESTIONS. SO YOU'VE BEEN

00:27:30.348 --> 00:27:31.449
WORKING ON THIS SUBJECT NOW FOR

00:27:31.516 --> 00:27:33.551
A COUPLE OF YEARS. WHAT HAVE YOU

00:27:33.618 --> 00:27:35.653
LEARNED TO THE BILLS THAT WE SAW

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.856
LAST COUPLE OF YEARS? I MEAN,

00:27:37.922 --> 00:27:38.523
WE'RE VERY BROAD AND KIND OF ALL

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:40.358
OVER THE PLACE, NOT WITHOUT GOOD

00:27:40.425 --> 00:27:41.760
INTENTION. IT'S JUST. WHAT HAVE

00:27:41.826 --> 00:27:43.428
YOU LEARNED TO HELP US

00:27:43.495 --> 00:27:45.263
UNDERSTAND WHAT WE NEED TO DO

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:47.065
WHEN PEOPLE COME AND SPEAK FOR

00:27:47.132 --> 00:27:48.800
OR AGAINST WHETHER THEY'RE THE

00:27:48.867 --> 00:27:50.668
PLATFORM PEOPLE OR JUST

00:27:50.735 --> 00:27:52.470
CONCERNED INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING

00:27:52.537 --> 00:27:54.973
MYSELF, WHAT ARE WE SPEAKING ON?

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.307
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR TO FIX

00:27:56.374 --> 00:27:58.877
OR TO TAKE CARE OF? SURE. AND ON

00:27:58.943 --> 00:28:01.246
THE ON OUR BILL LAST YEAR WAS IT

00:28:01.312 --> 00:28:02.914
WAS DEFINITELY A BIG BILL, I

00:28:02.981 --> 00:28:04.382
THINK. I THINK IT WAS A

00:28:04.449 --> 00:28:04.916
WELL-CONSTRUCTED BILL. AND

00:28:04.983 --> 00:28:07.552
THAT'S WHY IT GOT BIPARTISAN

00:28:07.619 --> 00:28:09.154
SUPPORT AND GOT VERY BROAD

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:11.189
SUPPORT IN BOTH HOUSES. AND

00:28:11.256 --> 00:28:12.891
FRANKLY, IF YOU LOOK AT THE

00:28:12.957 --> 00:28:14.059
GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE ON IT,

00:28:14.125 --> 00:28:16.661
IT WAS BY FAR THE LONGEST VETO

00:28:16.728 --> 00:28:19.130
MESSAGE I HAVE EVER SEEN, WHICH

00:28:19.197 --> 00:28:21.966
AND I THINK THAT AND THAT

00:28:22.033 --> 00:28:23.568
REFLECTS THE FACT THAT I KNOW

00:28:23.635 --> 00:28:25.303
THAT THE GOVERNOR STRUGGLED WITH

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:27.806
THIS. I THINK HE REALLY SAW THE

00:28:27.872 --> 00:28:28.440
IMPORTANCE OF WHAT WE WERE

00:28:28.506 --> 00:28:30.208
TRYING TO DEAL WITH AND REALLY

00:28:30.275 --> 00:28:32.010
STRUGGLED WITH. WHAT'S THE BEST

00:28:32.077 --> 00:28:32.510
APPROACH, AND I REALLY

00:28:32.577 --> 00:28:33.511
APPRECIATE THAT. HIS VETO

00:28:33.578 --> 00:28:34.879
MESSAGE WAS VERY THOUGHTFUL AND

00:28:34.946 --> 00:28:37.482
IT CREATED THE WORKING GROUP.

00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:38.550
AND SO, YOU KNOW, WHAT I'VE

00:28:38.616 --> 00:28:42.454
LEARNED IS THAT WE ALL ARE

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.689
TRYING WE ALL WANT TECHNOLOGY TO

00:28:44.756 --> 00:28:45.790
SUCCEED IN MAKING THE WORLD

00:28:45.857 --> 00:28:47.959
BETTER. WE I THINK WE ALL WANT

00:28:48.026 --> 00:28:50.962
THAT. AND NONE OF US THERE ARE

00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:51.629
SOME PEOPLE THERE ARE SOME

00:28:51.696 --> 00:28:53.031
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO LIKE, SQUASH

00:28:53.098 --> 00:28:54.866
IT. BUT I THINK THAT'S A SMALL

00:28:54.933 --> 00:28:56.935
MINORITY OF YOU. I THINK

00:28:57.001 --> 00:28:58.002
OVERWHELMINGLY THE PUBLIC. AND

00:28:58.069 --> 00:29:00.138
WE SEE THIS FROM THE POLLING

00:29:00.205 --> 00:29:01.139
BECAUSE THE BILL LAST YEAR HAD

00:29:01.206 --> 00:29:03.007
LIKE WAS POLLING STATEWIDE, LIKE

00:29:03.074 --> 00:29:05.543
ALMOST 80% HIGHER, HIGHER

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:07.412
SUPPORT AMONG TECH WORKERS THAN

00:29:07.479 --> 00:29:08.613
AMONG THE GENERAL PUBLIC,

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.148
SUPPORT AMONG REPUBLICANS,

00:29:10.215 --> 00:29:12.617
DEMOCRATS ALL OVER. AND THAT'S

00:29:12.684 --> 00:29:14.185
NOT BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT TO STOP

00:29:14.252 --> 00:29:15.720
INNOVATION, BUT THEY WANT TO

00:29:15.787 --> 00:29:18.690
MAKE SURE THAT POLICY MAKERS ARE

00:29:18.756 --> 00:29:21.459
ACTUALLY CARING ABOUT PUBLIC

00:29:21.526 --> 00:29:24.295
SAFETY AND WHAT THE IMPACTS THAT

00:29:24.362 --> 00:29:25.630
BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE COULD

00:29:25.697 --> 00:29:28.600
BE. AND SO WHAT I'VE LEARNED IS

00:29:28.666 --> 00:29:30.335
THAT THAT THERE IS BROAD SUPPORT

00:29:30.401 --> 00:29:32.270
FOR, FOR TAKING STEPS TO PROTECT

00:29:32.337 --> 00:29:35.106
THE PUBLIC WHILE ALSO PROMOTING

00:29:35.173 --> 00:29:37.675
INNOVATION. AND SO, YOU KNOW, WE

00:29:37.742 --> 00:29:38.810
I THOUGHT LAST YEAR THAT

00:29:38.877 --> 00:29:40.111
REQUIRING SAFETY TESTING WAS

00:29:40.178 --> 00:29:41.412
REASONABLE, SINCE ALL THE LARGE

00:29:41.479 --> 00:29:43.148
LABS HAD ALREADY COMMITTED TO

00:29:43.214 --> 00:29:44.415
DOING THAT. OBVIOUSLY IT

00:29:44.482 --> 00:29:46.317
PROVOKED A BIG FIGHT, BUT THAT

00:29:46.384 --> 00:29:48.319
THE BILL LAST YEAR, WHAT WAS

00:29:48.386 --> 00:29:50.188
INTERESTING ABOUT IT, IT WAS THE

00:29:50.255 --> 00:29:53.024
DEBATE ABOUT IT WAS WAS NOT DID

00:29:53.091 --> 00:29:55.326
NOT HAVE A TON TO DO WITH WHAT

00:29:55.393 --> 00:29:57.195
WAS ACTUALLY IN THE BILL. WITH

00:29:57.262 --> 00:29:58.763
ALL RESPECT TO BOTH SUPPORTERS

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:00.231
AND OPPONENTS, IT BECAME SORT OF

00:30:00.298 --> 00:30:02.433
A SYMBOL AND A PROXY WHERE THERE

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:03.902
WERE SUPPORTERS WHO WOULD TALK

00:30:03.968 --> 00:30:05.603
ABOUT IT IN WAYS THAT LIKE THAT,

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:07.138
LIKE I'M LIKE, THAT'S NOT WHAT

00:30:07.205 --> 00:30:08.973
THE BILL DOES. THE BILL DOESN'T

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.642
IT'S NOT AS BIG AS SOME PEOPLE

00:30:10.708 --> 00:30:12.210
THOUGHT IT WAS, AND SOME

00:30:12.277 --> 00:30:13.178
OPPONENTS WERE TALKING ABOUT IT

00:30:13.244 --> 00:30:15.079
IN WAYS THAT MADE THE BILL SEEM

00:30:15.146 --> 00:30:16.314
MUCH BIGGER THAN IT WAS. BUT I

00:30:16.381 --> 00:30:18.816
THINK IT WAS AN INCREDIBLY

00:30:18.883 --> 00:30:19.717
IMPORTANT CONVERSATION THAT THAT

00:30:19.784 --> 00:30:22.487
SB 1047 SPARKED IN TERMS OF WHAT

00:30:22.554 --> 00:30:24.422
DO WE MEAN WHEN WE SAY WE WANT

00:30:24.489 --> 00:30:26.224
TO PROMOTE INNOVATION? AND WHAT

00:30:26.291 --> 00:30:27.559
WHAT DO WE MEAN WHEN WE SAY THAT

00:30:27.625 --> 00:30:29.127
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:30:29.194 --> 00:30:30.595
TECHNOLOGY DOESN'T HARM THE

00:30:30.662 --> 00:30:32.363
PUBLIC? AND, YOU KNOW, WE

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:34.399
OBVIOUSLY DID NOTHING FOR MANY

00:30:34.465 --> 00:30:36.701
YEARS AROUND SOCIAL MEDIA, AND

00:30:36.768 --> 00:30:38.002
WE'VE SEEN SOME OF THE

00:30:38.069 --> 00:30:39.404
CHALLENGES THAT THAT'S CREATED

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:41.706
WITH KIDS AND DISINFORMATION.

00:30:41.773 --> 00:30:44.976
AND SO HOW DO WE GET AHEAD OF

00:30:45.043 --> 00:30:45.643
THOSE RISKS HERE? AND WHAT I'VE

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:48.813
ALSO LEARNED IS THAT THERE ARE

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:51.015
FOLKS IN INDUSTRY WHO REALLY GET

00:30:51.082 --> 00:30:53.251
IT AND WANT TO GET TO A GOOD

00:30:53.318 --> 00:30:54.786
PLACE IN TERMS OF SAFETY

00:30:54.852 --> 00:30:56.487
REGULATION. AND THEY AND THEY'RE

00:30:56.554 --> 00:30:57.322
VERY GENUINE. THERE ARE OTHER

00:30:57.388 --> 00:30:59.324
FOLKS IN INDUSTRY THAT YOU COULD

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:00.959
PROPOSE THE MOST MINIMAL THING,

00:31:01.025 --> 00:31:02.460
AND THEY WILL OPPOSE IT, BECAUSE

00:31:02.527 --> 00:31:04.596
THEY JUST DO NOT WANT THE

00:31:04.662 --> 00:31:05.263
GOVERNMENT TO BE INVOLVED IN ANY

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:07.699
WAY IN REGULATING TECHNOLOGY. SO

00:31:07.765 --> 00:31:09.434
IT'S COMPLICATED. BUT I THINK

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.102
THIS WITH A TRANSPARENCY

00:31:11.169 --> 00:31:13.338
APPROACH, I THINK I THINK WE'RE

00:31:13.404 --> 00:31:14.706
IN A GOOD PLACE UNDERSTANDING

00:31:14.772 --> 00:31:16.007
THAT THERE'S MORE WORK TO DO.

00:31:16.074 --> 00:31:17.742
OKAY. I DON'T WANT TO TAKE UP

00:31:17.809 --> 00:31:19.877
TOO MUCH OF EVERYONE'S TIME.

00:31:19.944 --> 00:31:20.912
JUST A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. I

00:31:20.979 --> 00:31:22.513
THINK I'VE SAID THIS LAST YEAR

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:24.249
AND THEN I SAW IT IN SOME

00:31:24.315 --> 00:31:26.217
COMMENTS THIS YEAR. THE EU MODEL

00:31:26.284 --> 00:31:28.753
WAS TO INVOLVE THE COMPANIES,

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:30.989
THE STAKEHOLDERS, IF YOU WILL,

00:31:31.055 --> 00:31:32.323
AND IT TOOK SEVERAL YEARS TO

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:34.192
KIND OF IRON ALL THIS OUT AND

00:31:34.259 --> 00:31:36.294
WORK ALL THIS OUT. WHY ISN'T

00:31:36.361 --> 00:31:39.864
JUST TO MAYBE JUST TAKE FURTHER

00:31:39.931 --> 00:31:41.132
WHAT YOU JUST SAID. SOME ARE

00:31:41.199 --> 00:31:42.500
WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU AND

00:31:42.567 --> 00:31:44.369
SOME AREN'T. YOU'RE WORKING WITH

00:31:44.435 --> 00:31:45.770
THE LARGE PLATFORMS, BUT IT'S

00:31:45.837 --> 00:31:47.272
THE SMALLER COMPANIES TOO THAT

00:31:47.338 --> 00:31:49.307
CAN GATHER UP $1 BILLION WITH

00:31:49.374 --> 00:31:50.108
FUNDING, AND THEY'RE ON THEIR

00:31:50.174 --> 00:31:52.243
WAY TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANT TO

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:56.147
DO WITH AI. DO YOU THINK WE ARE

00:31:56.214 --> 00:31:57.982
REALLY RUSHING THIS UNTIL WE GET

00:31:58.049 --> 00:32:01.552
ALL THE PLAYERS, STAKEHOLDERS TO

00:32:01.619 --> 00:32:04.022
REALLY HONE IN ON WHAT YOU'RE

00:32:04.088 --> 00:32:05.823
TRYING TO DO FOR A SAFETY

00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:07.692
REASON? AND THE CATASTROPHIC

00:32:07.759 --> 00:32:10.328
WORD IS KIND OF FRIGHTENING. AND

00:32:10.395 --> 00:32:12.297
HOW DO WE EVEN KNOW THAT WHAT

00:32:12.363 --> 00:32:13.831
YOU'RE PROPOSING WILL CONTROL

00:32:13.898 --> 00:32:15.300
THE TRANSPARENCY? YES. BUT WILL

00:32:15.366 --> 00:32:17.168
WE REALLY KNOW? YEAH, I THINK WE

00:32:17.235 --> 00:32:19.137
CAN GET THERE. HONESTLY, I THINK

00:32:19.203 --> 00:32:20.605
WE KNOW WHAT THE ISSUES ARE.

00:32:20.672 --> 00:32:22.340
THERE ARE SOME DISPUTES ABOUT

00:32:22.407 --> 00:32:23.608
SOME OF THOSE ISSUES, BUT WE I

00:32:23.675 --> 00:32:25.777
THINK WE HAVE A GRASP OF WHAT

00:32:25.843 --> 00:32:27.745
THE ISSUES ARE. AND I, I THINK

00:32:27.812 --> 00:32:29.480
IT IS TIME SENSITIVE. RIGHT.

00:32:29.547 --> 00:32:32.150
THIS TECHNOLOGY IS MOVING MORE

00:32:32.216 --> 00:32:34.419
QUICKLY THAN PEOPLE ANTICIPATED

00:32:34.485 --> 00:32:36.120
OR SOME ANTICIPATED IT, BUT

00:32:36.187 --> 00:32:37.989
OTHERS DIDN'T. AND THERE'S ALL

00:32:38.056 --> 00:32:39.223
SORTS OF PREDICTIONS ABOUT WHEN

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:40.992
ARE WE GOING TO GET TO

00:32:41.059 --> 00:32:43.061
ARTIFICIAL GENERAL INTELLIGENCE

00:32:43.127 --> 00:32:44.595
IS WHEN IS THERE A POSSIBILITY

00:32:44.662 --> 00:32:46.297
OF SOME SORT OF

00:32:46.364 --> 00:32:46.898
SUPERINTELLIGENCE, AND PEOPLE

00:32:46.964 --> 00:32:48.399
HAVE ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT

00:32:48.466 --> 00:32:49.834
PREDICTIONS ON IT. BUT JUST IN

00:32:49.901 --> 00:32:52.737
TERMS OF GENERATIVE AI, IT IS

00:32:52.804 --> 00:32:54.205
MOVING VERY, VERY QUICKLY. AND

00:32:54.272 --> 00:32:55.973
THOSE IMPACTS, WE'RE SEEING IT,

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:58.109
YOU KNOW, WITH JOB IMPACTS,

00:32:58.176 --> 00:32:59.444
WHICH IN SOME WAYS IS THE

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:00.978
HARDEST ISSUE, THE JOBS ISSUE,

00:33:01.045 --> 00:33:03.147
BECAUSE TECHNOLOGY, TECHNOLOGY

00:33:03.214 --> 00:33:04.449
THROUGHOUT HUMAN HISTORY HAS HAD

00:33:04.515 --> 00:33:05.750
IMPACTS ON HOW PEOPLE WORK AND

00:33:05.817 --> 00:33:07.952
WHAT JOBS EXIST OR DON'T EXIST.

00:33:08.019 --> 00:33:10.455
IT'S NEVER HAPPENED AT THIS

00:33:10.521 --> 00:33:14.525
SPEED. BUT THEN ON SAFETY, ON ON

00:33:14.592 --> 00:33:17.495
AI, MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT YOUR

00:33:17.562 --> 00:33:19.697
LIFE, WHICH COULD BE PROFOUND

00:33:19.764 --> 00:33:21.432
DECISIONS ABOUT YOUR LIFE, ABOUT

00:33:21.499 --> 00:33:23.401
EMPLOYMENT, ABOUT BANKING, ABOUT

00:33:23.468 --> 00:33:24.702
SO MANY OTHER ISSUES WHERE ALL

00:33:24.769 --> 00:33:26.371
OF A SUDDEN A DECISION IS MADE

00:33:26.437 --> 00:33:28.139
ABOUT YOUR LIFE THAT IMPACTS IT

00:33:28.206 --> 00:33:30.641
IN A GRAVE WAY, AND NO HUMAN

00:33:30.708 --> 00:33:31.676
BEING WAS INVOLVED. AND SO THERE

00:33:31.743 --> 00:33:33.778
ARE JUST ALL SORTS OF ISSUES

00:33:33.845 --> 00:33:35.146
THAT WE'RE GRAPPLING WITH. I

00:33:35.213 --> 00:33:36.881
THINK WE KNOW WHAT THOSE ISSUES

00:33:36.948 --> 00:33:37.482
ARE. THERE ARE DISPUTES ABOUT

00:33:37.548 --> 00:33:39.283
HOW BEST TO ADDRESS IT, BUT IT

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:41.319
IS TIME SENSITIVE. AND I THINK

00:33:41.386 --> 00:33:42.687
HAVING LAWS WITH SOME

00:33:42.754 --> 00:33:44.622
FLEXIBILITY IN IT IS A GOOD

00:33:44.689 --> 00:33:46.357
THING. AND WE TRY TO DO THAT IN

00:33:46.424 --> 00:33:47.291
THIS BILL AS WELL, CONCERNED

00:33:47.358 --> 00:33:48.393
THAT THEY'RE NOT WORKING WITH

00:33:48.459 --> 00:33:51.596
YOU. Ó, I MEAN, I THINK, I

00:33:51.662 --> 00:33:54.932
THINK THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR

00:33:54.999 --> 00:33:56.734
SOME SOME FOLKS IN INDUSTRY HAVE

00:33:56.801 --> 00:33:58.603
BEEN WORKING WITH US. WE'VE BEEN

00:33:58.669 --> 00:33:59.971
IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

00:34:00.037 --> 00:34:01.606
CHAMBER WITH WITH A LARGE LABS.

00:34:01.672 --> 00:34:03.141
WE'VE BEEN REACHING OUT TO THE

00:34:03.207 --> 00:34:04.876
WHAT ABOUT THE SMALL? THE SMALL.

00:34:04.942 --> 00:34:06.477
YEAH. WE WE'VE WE'VE REACHED

00:34:06.544 --> 00:34:08.413
WE'VE WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN

00:34:08.479 --> 00:34:12.383
TALKING TO EVERYONE. YES. IT

00:34:12.450 --> 00:34:15.052
WOULD BE GOOD. I MEAN, IF THERE

00:34:15.119 --> 00:34:17.989
COULD BE A COMING TOGETHER OF A

00:34:18.055 --> 00:34:19.957
COMMON VOICE FOR WHERE WE ARE

00:34:20.024 --> 00:34:21.492
RIGHT NOW. NOW, OF COURSE, THE

00:34:21.559 --> 00:34:22.627
CHAMBER OF THE BUSINESS

00:34:22.693 --> 00:34:23.461
COMMUNITY, AS YOU SAID, YOU'RE

00:34:23.528 --> 00:34:25.163
NOT YOU'RE YOU WOULD SUPPORT

00:34:25.229 --> 00:34:26.697
AMENDMENTS AND SOME FIXES. IT'S

00:34:26.764 --> 00:34:28.533
KIND OF IT'S STILL IN WORK. WORK

00:34:28.599 --> 00:34:31.602
IN PROGRESS. I ACCEPT THAT IS

00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:33.504
OKAY. SO DOES INDUSTRY SEE THIS

00:34:33.571 --> 00:34:36.774
AS THE DEFINITIVE POLICY THAT IS

00:34:36.841 --> 00:34:39.243
GOING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH SOME?

00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:41.078
I CAN'T SPEAK FOR INDUSTRY. WHAT

00:34:41.145 --> 00:34:42.847
I CAN SAY IS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS

00:34:42.914 --> 00:34:44.348
AN OUTSIZED VOICE. AND WHEN THE

00:34:44.415 --> 00:34:46.784
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT

00:34:46.851 --> 00:34:48.719
APPARENTLY GOING TO DO ANYTHING

00:34:48.786 --> 00:34:50.721
TO REGULATE IT IN ANY WAY, WHICH

00:34:50.788 --> 00:34:52.590
SEEMS LIKELY, AT LEAST IN THE

00:34:52.657 --> 00:34:55.359
NEAR FUTURE, CALIFORNIA HAS AN

00:34:55.426 --> 00:34:57.528
INCREDIBLY POWERFUL VOICE

00:34:57.595 --> 00:34:58.996
BECAUSE OF JUST WE'RE THE WE'RE

00:34:59.063 --> 00:35:01.365
THE CAPITAL OF TECH INNOVATION

00:35:01.432 --> 00:35:02.567
GLOBALLY, AND WE STILL ARE, NO

00:35:02.633 --> 00:35:04.402
MATTER WHAT AUSTIN OR NEW YORK

00:35:04.469 --> 00:35:05.903
MIGHT SAY, WHERE IT'S STILL

00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:07.638
HERE, AND WE'RE PROUD OF THAT.

00:35:07.705 --> 00:35:10.908
AND SO WE WHEN CALIFORNIA SPEAKS

00:35:10.975 --> 00:35:12.977
ON AN ISSUE LIKE THIS, IT IS IT

00:35:13.044 --> 00:35:14.879
HAS INTERNATIONAL

00:35:14.946 --> 00:35:16.347
REVERBERATIONS. I CAN TELL YOU

00:35:16.414 --> 00:35:17.748
THE NUMBER, THE AMOUNT OF

00:35:17.815 --> 00:35:19.183
INTERNATIONAL OUTREACH I GOT

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:21.586
ABOUT THE BILL LAST YEAR. IT WAS

00:35:21.652 --> 00:35:23.554
EXTRAORDINARY CONSTANT. THEY'RE

00:35:23.621 --> 00:35:25.289
ALL WATCHING WHAT WE WERE DOING

00:35:25.356 --> 00:35:26.057
IN CALIFORNIA. ONE FINAL

00:35:26.123 --> 00:35:27.558
QUESTION. IF THIS IS EVEN

00:35:27.625 --> 00:35:28.526
ANSWERABLE, ALL THESE BILLS THAT

00:35:28.593 --> 00:35:29.927
ARE PENDING NOW BEFORE THE

00:35:29.994 --> 00:35:31.429
COMMITTEE AND MOVING THROUGH THE

00:35:31.496 --> 00:35:32.363
PROCESS RELATED TO PRIVACY

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:38.703
RELATED TO CHILDREN AND WELL,

00:35:38.769 --> 00:35:41.105
ALL THAT. WOULD THIS BILL

00:35:41.172 --> 00:35:42.540
RESOLVE THAT SO WE DON'T DEAL

00:35:42.607 --> 00:35:45.076
WITH CHAT BOXES AND CREATING

00:35:45.142 --> 00:35:46.944
HORRIBLE THINGS WITH THIS BILL.

00:35:47.011 --> 00:35:48.813
TAKE CARE OF THAT. SO WE'LL

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.181
STILL HAVE THOSE KINDS OF BILLS

00:35:50.248 --> 00:35:51.649
SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSING VARIOUS

00:35:51.716 --> 00:35:53.084
PROBLEMS. YEAH. THIS BILL IS

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:54.519
ABOUT SAFETY FOR REALLY

00:35:54.585 --> 00:35:56.687
SIGNIFICANT SAFETY RISKS. OTHER

00:35:56.754 --> 00:35:58.089
BILLS MAY BE ABOUT

00:35:58.155 --> 00:35:59.156
DISCRIMINATION OR ABOUT

00:35:59.223 --> 00:36:00.258
DEEPFAKES THAT WILL CONTINUE.

00:36:00.324 --> 00:36:01.492
THAT'LL CONTINUE. THIS IS KIND

00:36:01.559 --> 00:36:04.462
OF THE FOUNDATIONAL ONE FOR ONE

00:36:04.529 --> 00:36:06.464
PIECE OF IT. THE SIGNIFICANT

00:36:06.531 --> 00:36:08.900
SAFETY RISKS OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

00:36:08.966 --> 00:36:12.103
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

00:36:12.169 --> 00:36:14.405
SORRY TO PROMPT YOU IN THE

00:36:14.472 --> 00:36:15.306
MIDDLE OF THAT. BUT I THINK IT'S

00:36:15.373 --> 00:36:16.340
IMPORTANT BECAUSE I'VE HAD THE

00:36:16.407 --> 00:36:18.309
PRIVILEGE OF TALKING TO SOME OF

00:36:18.376 --> 00:36:19.410
THE INDUSTRY PLAYERS THAT THE

00:36:19.477 --> 00:36:20.311
SENATOR HAS BEEN CONSULTING WITH

00:36:20.378 --> 00:36:22.680
ON THIS, AND I THINK BUT CORRECT

00:36:22.747 --> 00:36:24.749
ME IF I'M WRONG, OPPOSITION. UP

00:36:24.815 --> 00:36:26.083
TO THIS POINT, YOU WERE NOT

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:27.451
OPPOSED TO THE PRIOR TO THE

00:36:27.518 --> 00:36:29.186
SENATE VERSION. AM I RIGHT ABOUT

00:36:29.253 --> 00:36:31.222
THAT? WE DID NOT HAVE A POSITION

00:36:31.289 --> 00:36:32.323
ON THE PRIOR VERSION. WE WERE

00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:33.658
TALKING WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE

00:36:33.724 --> 00:36:34.525
QUITE EXTENSIVELY SINCE EVEN

00:36:34.592 --> 00:36:35.826
BEFORE THE INTRODUCTION, THEY'VE

00:36:35.893 --> 00:36:37.995
DONE OUTREACH TO US. SO YEAH,

00:36:38.062 --> 00:36:40.464
IT'S HELPFUL, IF I MAY, WE

00:36:40.531 --> 00:36:42.633
REPRESENT BOTH SMALL AND LARGE

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:43.968
BUSINESSES, AND CERTAINLY WE

00:36:44.035 --> 00:36:46.671
NEED TO BE AT THE TABLE AND HAVE

00:36:46.737 --> 00:36:47.305
THESE CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE IT

00:36:47.371 --> 00:36:49.073
AFFECTS ALL OF OUR MEMBERS. AND

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:51.342
IT WOULDN'T BEHOOVE US TO NOT BE

00:36:51.409 --> 00:36:53.010
HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS. SO

00:36:53.077 --> 00:36:55.313
WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE THEM AND

00:36:55.379 --> 00:36:56.280
HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET SOME MORE

00:36:56.347 --> 00:36:57.949
GOOD THIS YEAR. YEAH. OKAY.

00:36:58.015 --> 00:37:00.251
ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S. THANK YOU,

00:37:00.318 --> 00:37:01.752
MADAM CHAIR. AND THANK YOU,

00:37:01.819 --> 00:37:03.087
SENATOR. I MEAN, ONE THING

00:37:03.154 --> 00:37:04.422
THAT'S REALLY REASSURING FOR ME

00:37:04.488 --> 00:37:06.457
IS WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE

00:37:06.524 --> 00:37:08.593
ABOUT SOMETHING. THAT SOMETHING

00:37:08.659 --> 00:37:09.226
NEEDS TO BE DONE. I SUPPORTED

00:37:09.293 --> 00:37:11.095
THIS BILL IN JUDICIARY BECAUSE

00:37:11.162 --> 00:37:12.597
OF THE SHEER VOLUME OF

00:37:12.663 --> 00:37:14.365
INFORMATION. I DO WANT TO ECHO

00:37:14.432 --> 00:37:15.700
THE CONCERNS OF MY COLLEAGUE AND

00:37:15.766 --> 00:37:17.435
ALSO TELL HER THANK YOU, BECAUSE

00:37:17.501 --> 00:37:19.403
I DO NOT COME FROM THE TECH

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:20.538
WORLD, AND BECAUSE OF THE TECH

00:37:20.605 --> 00:37:22.974
CAUCUS, I WAS ABLE TO VISIT WHAT

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.041
I BELIEVE IS YOUR DISTRICT AND

00:37:24.108 --> 00:37:25.776
TOURED THE EXTRAORDINARY WORLD

00:37:25.843 --> 00:37:27.845
THAT IS THE TECH INDUSTRY IN THE

00:37:27.912 --> 00:37:29.313
BAY AREA. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:30.481
THAT WE'RE SUPPORTING THEM AND

00:37:30.548 --> 00:37:32.149
KEEPING THEM THERE. AND I THINK

00:37:32.216 --> 00:37:33.217
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE

00:37:33.284 --> 00:37:35.186
TRYING TO DO IN MAKING SURE THAT

00:37:35.252 --> 00:37:36.454
WE'RE PROTECTING THE PUBLIC AT

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:38.222
THE SAME TIME. SO I'D LOVE TO BE

00:37:38.289 --> 00:37:39.557
INCLUDED IN CONVERSATIONS WITH

00:37:39.624 --> 00:37:40.658
THIS BECAUSE I IT'S JUST THIS

00:37:40.725 --> 00:37:42.393
WORLD IS SO EXTRAORDINARY. WE

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:43.461
ARE IN LIKE, THE HORSE AND BUGGY

00:37:43.527 --> 00:37:46.397
ERA OF AI, AND WE COULD BE IN

00:37:46.464 --> 00:37:47.131
FLYING CARS IN THE VERY NEAR

00:37:47.198 --> 00:37:49.400
FUTURE. BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:37:49.467 --> 00:37:50.101
THAT THE RIGHT SAFEGUARDS ARE

00:37:50.167 --> 00:37:52.236
THERE. SO I'M NOT GOING TO BE

00:37:52.303 --> 00:37:54.372
VOTING ON THIS TODAY, BUT I DO

00:37:54.438 --> 00:37:55.373
LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING IT ON

00:37:55.439 --> 00:37:57.041
THE FLOOR, BECAUSE I KNOW HOW

00:37:57.108 --> 00:37:58.309
HARD WORKING YOU ARE AND WILLING

00:37:58.376 --> 00:37:59.477
TO GET THIS EXACTLY WHERE IT

00:37:59.543 --> 00:38:01.245
NEEDS TO BE. SO THANK YOU VERY

00:38:01.312 --> 00:38:03.314
MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I

00:38:03.381 --> 00:38:04.482
DON'T SEE ANYBODY ELSE. ANYBODY

00:38:04.548 --> 00:38:05.316
ELSE? OKAY. WELL, I WANT TO

00:38:05.383 --> 00:38:07.084
THANK THE SENATOR FOR WORKING

00:38:07.151 --> 00:38:08.452
WITH OUR STAFF AND ALSO TO THE

00:38:08.519 --> 00:38:10.187
STAFF. I THINK I APPRECIATE

00:38:10.254 --> 00:38:11.222
ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN'S COMMENTS

00:38:11.288 --> 00:38:13.424
BECAUSE THEY THEY ARE A SMALL

00:38:13.491 --> 00:38:15.292
BUT MIGHTY TEAM WITH A NUMBER OF

00:38:15.359 --> 00:38:16.994
BILLS THAT COME THROUGH THIS

00:38:17.061 --> 00:38:17.962
COMMITTEE THESE DAYS AND THE

00:38:18.029 --> 00:38:21.298
COMPLEXITY THAT WE SEE. AND I

00:38:21.365 --> 00:38:22.500
THINK, YOU KNOW, THE SENATOR HAS

00:38:22.566 --> 00:38:23.501
BEEN COLLABORATIVE BOTH WITH

00:38:23.567 --> 00:38:25.336
COMMITTEE AND ALSO WITH MANY

00:38:25.403 --> 00:38:26.370
STAKEHOLDERS AS THIS MOVED

00:38:26.437 --> 00:38:28.339
FORWARD. AND I THINK THERE ARE A

00:38:28.406 --> 00:38:29.674
COUPLE OF THINGS THAT ARE

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:30.274
SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT ABOUT

00:38:30.341 --> 00:38:31.842
THIS YEAR THAT I WANT TO

00:38:31.909 --> 00:38:33.577
HIGHLIGHT, IN ADDITION TO WHAT

00:38:33.644 --> 00:38:35.713
THE SENATOR SAID, WHICH IS UNDER

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.348
THIS BILL, ONE OF THE THINGS I

00:38:37.415 --> 00:38:39.316
HEAR FROM INDUSTRY A LOT IS WE

00:38:39.383 --> 00:38:41.352
AND I THINK I HEARD YOU SAY

00:38:41.419 --> 00:38:42.920
THIS, WE KNOW OUR PRODUCTS BEST.

00:38:42.987 --> 00:38:45.222
WE KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING.

00:38:45.289 --> 00:38:47.491
WE KNOW HOW TO KEEP HOW TO

00:38:47.558 --> 00:38:48.826
CREATE SAFETY PROTOCOLS. AND

00:38:48.893 --> 00:38:50.161
THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY THE BASIS

00:38:50.227 --> 00:38:52.229
OF THIS BILL IS THAT THEY WILL

00:38:52.296 --> 00:38:53.898
BE DEFINING THEIR OWN SAFETY

00:38:53.964 --> 00:38:54.999
PROTOCOLS. THEY WILL BE MAKING

00:38:55.066 --> 00:38:58.002
THOSE PUBLIC, AND THEN THEY WILL

00:38:58.069 --> 00:39:00.137
HAVE TO FOLLOW THEM. AND THAT

00:39:00.204 --> 00:39:01.972
FEELS LIKE THAT IS SIGNIFICANTLY

00:39:02.039 --> 00:39:03.174
DIFFERENT FROM LAST YEAR. AND IT

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.442
ALSO IS PUTTING THE

00:39:04.508 --> 00:39:06.544
RESPONSIBILITY ON THE AI

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:07.678
COMPANIES TO DECIDE HOW TO KEEP

00:39:07.745 --> 00:39:09.480
THE COMMUNITY SAFE. BUT ALLOWING

00:39:09.547 --> 00:39:12.583
US AS THE PEOPLE WHOSE SOLE ROLE

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:14.952
IS TO KEEP COMMUNITIES SAFE,

00:39:15.019 --> 00:39:16.454
INFORMED IN HOW THAT PROGRESS IS

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:18.089
HAPPENING. I ALSO, YOU KNOW,

00:39:18.155 --> 00:39:18.956
APPRECIATED ONE OF THE

00:39:19.023 --> 00:39:20.357
AMENDMENTS THAT THE SENATOR IS

00:39:20.424 --> 00:39:22.059
TAKING HERE, WHICH IS THAT FOR I

00:39:22.126 --> 00:39:23.794
MEAN, THE RISKS THAT ARE

00:39:23.861 --> 00:39:26.063
CONTEMPLATED IN THIS BILL ARE

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:27.732
RISKS TO HUMAN LIFE. I MEAN,

00:39:27.798 --> 00:39:28.933
THIS IS THE MOST FUNDAMENTALLY

00:39:28.999 --> 00:39:30.167
IMPORTANT THING THAT WE DO, I

00:39:30.234 --> 00:39:31.602
THINK, IS KEEP COMMUNITIES SAFE.

00:39:31.669 --> 00:39:33.571
AND SO ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS IS

00:39:33.637 --> 00:39:34.772
THAT WITHIN 24 HOURS, THE

00:39:34.839 --> 00:39:36.173
COMPANY WOULD BE OBLIGATED TO

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.609
TELL THE RELEVANT GOVERNMENTAL

00:39:38.676 --> 00:39:40.177
AUTHORITY THAT COULD HELP KEEP

00:39:40.244 --> 00:39:41.178
COMMUNITIES SAFE IN THE EVENT

00:39:41.245 --> 00:39:42.513
THAT SOMETHING WERE TO ACTUALLY

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:44.882
COME TO PASS. AND I THINK THAT'S

00:39:44.949 --> 00:39:46.217
AN IMPORTANT AMENDMENT, BECAUSE

00:39:46.283 --> 00:39:47.284
WHAT IT SHOWS IS THAT AS THIS

00:39:47.351 --> 00:39:48.786
INNOVATION HAPPENS, WE ARE JUST

00:39:48.853 --> 00:39:50.554
ASKING THAT YOU BRING US, US,

00:39:50.621 --> 00:39:53.557
THE GOVERNMENT, POLICE, YOU

00:39:53.624 --> 00:39:54.291
KNOW, OUR PUBLIC HEALTH

00:39:54.358 --> 00:39:55.559
OFFICIALS. IT DEPENDS ON WHAT

00:39:55.626 --> 00:39:58.262
RISK IS COMING TO PASS INTO INTO

00:39:58.329 --> 00:39:59.864
THE CONVERSATION TO HELP KEEP

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:01.265
COMMUNITIES SAFE. AND I THINK

00:40:01.332 --> 00:40:03.167
THAT'S SO FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR

00:40:03.234 --> 00:40:07.538
ROLE. AND YOU ARE NOTHING IF NOT

00:40:07.605 --> 00:40:08.839
TENACIOUS. SO I KNOW THAT, YOU

00:40:08.906 --> 00:40:11.408
KNOW, YOU HAVE TALL AND TALL.

00:40:11.475 --> 00:40:13.577
YOU HAVE STUCK WITH IT, I THINK,

00:40:13.644 --> 00:40:15.045
BECAUSE YOU BELIEVE SO DEEPLY,

00:40:15.112 --> 00:40:17.214
DESPITE THE MANY CRITICISMS YOU

00:40:17.281 --> 00:40:19.383
GOT FOR THIS, THAT THAT THIS IS

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:21.285
REALLY IMPORTANT. I'LL ALSO NOTE

00:40:21.352 --> 00:40:22.987
THAT SINCE LAST YEAR, NEW YORK

00:40:23.053 --> 00:40:25.022
HAS ALREADY PASSED A LAW THAT IS

00:40:25.089 --> 00:40:27.124
DIFFERENT, BUT IS SIMILAR IN A

00:40:27.191 --> 00:40:29.193
LOT OF WAYS. AND SO WE ARE NOT

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:31.996
THE FIRST ANYMORE BECAUSE OF THE

00:40:32.062 --> 00:40:34.064
VETO. AND SO I DO THINK THIS IS

00:40:34.131 --> 00:40:35.332
SOMETHING THAT, YOU KNOW, TWO OF

00:40:35.399 --> 00:40:37.001
THE LARGEST ECONOMIES IN THE

00:40:37.067 --> 00:40:39.003
COUNTRY ARE STARTING TO LOOK AT

00:40:39.069 --> 00:40:40.471
IS HOW DO WE KEEP OUR

00:40:40.538 --> 00:40:41.005
COMMUNITIES SAFE AS THIS

00:40:41.071 --> 00:40:41.672
INNOVATION HAPPENS? I'VE ALWAYS

00:40:41.739 --> 00:40:43.407
BEEN A FAN OF CAL COMPUTE, AS

00:40:43.474 --> 00:40:45.976
YOU KNOW, I AM, YOU KNOW, HAVE

00:40:46.043 --> 00:40:48.212
TOLD YOU THAT I'M HAPPY TO BE A

00:40:48.279 --> 00:40:50.281
PARTNER IN TRYING TO SEE THAT

00:40:50.347 --> 00:40:51.415
COME TO FRUITION, BECAUSE I

00:40:51.482 --> 00:40:52.316
THINK COMPETITION IN THE

00:40:52.383 --> 00:40:53.350
MARKETPLACE IS ALSO ONE OF THE

00:40:53.417 --> 00:40:54.518
THINGS THAT WILL KEEP US SAFE.

00:40:54.585 --> 00:40:57.188
AS AI COMES TO PASS, AND THAT

00:40:57.254 --> 00:40:58.489
ALLOWING DEMOCRATIZING COMPUTE

00:40:58.556 --> 00:41:00.491
IS ONE OF THE WAYS TO DO THAT.

00:41:00.558 --> 00:41:02.293
AND CURRENTLY, YOU HAVE TO GET

00:41:02.359 --> 00:41:04.061
$1 BILLION IN ORDER TO GET INTO

00:41:04.128 --> 00:41:05.796
THE GAME. AND THE IDEA THAT WE

00:41:05.863 --> 00:41:07.231
AS THE WORLD'S CAPITAL OF

00:41:07.298 --> 00:41:08.065
INNOVATION WOULD SAY, NO, WE'RE

00:41:08.132 --> 00:41:09.333
GOING TO LET EVERYBODY PLAY THIS

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:11.001
GAME, AND WE'RE GOING TO LET

00:41:11.068 --> 00:41:12.937
EVERYONE TRY TO INNOVATE AND

00:41:13.003 --> 00:41:13.604
CREATE MIRACULOUS THINGS HERE IN

00:41:13.671 --> 00:41:15.539
CALIFORNIA. AND WE'RE GOING TO

00:41:15.606 --> 00:41:16.373
PROVIDE THE RESOURCE TO DO THAT,

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.242
I THINK IS SOMETHING THAT WILL

00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:19.243
KEEP COMMUNITIES SAFER. SO BUILT

00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:20.644
INTO THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT

00:41:20.711 --> 00:41:21.846
PIECES THAT I THINK COME

00:41:21.912 --> 00:41:24.915
TOGETHER TO CREATE A SAFER

00:41:24.982 --> 00:41:26.250
ECOSYSTEM. ALSO THE

00:41:26.317 --> 00:41:27.084
WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS, WHICH

00:41:27.151 --> 00:41:28.786
I KNOW, YOU KNOW, YOU WEREN'T

00:41:28.853 --> 00:41:30.721
OPPOSED TO BECAUSE THOSE WERE IN

00:41:30.788 --> 00:41:32.389
THE BILL PRIOR, ARE REALLY

00:41:32.456 --> 00:41:33.591
IMPORTANT BECAUSE CURRENTLY YOU

00:41:33.657 --> 00:41:35.192
CAN ONLY WHISTLEBLOW FOR THINGS

00:41:35.259 --> 00:41:37.728
THAT ARE ILLEGAL. AND A LOT OF

00:41:37.795 --> 00:41:38.929
WHAT THIS BILL CONTEMPLATES

00:41:38.996 --> 00:41:41.165
ISN'T NOTHING IS REACHED THE

00:41:41.232 --> 00:41:42.600
POINT OF ILLEGAL CONDUCT WHEN WE

00:41:42.666 --> 00:41:44.501
NEED TO KNOW THERE ARE RISKS

00:41:44.568 --> 00:41:46.437
COMING TO PASS. AND SO THAT'S AN

00:41:46.503 --> 00:41:46.871
IMPORTANT CHANGE TO

00:41:46.937 --> 00:41:48.472
WHISTLEBLOWER LAW THAT I THINK

00:41:48.539 --> 00:41:52.243
IS CRITICAL AND WILL KEEP OUR

00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:53.811
COMMUNITIES SAFER. AND SO I'M

00:41:53.878 --> 00:41:55.312
HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT TODAY. I'M

00:41:55.379 --> 00:41:57.214
HAPPY TO HEAR, YOU KNOW, THAT WE

00:41:57.281 --> 00:41:59.383
HAVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:02.286
CONCEPT, IF NOT IN PRACTICE. AND

00:42:02.353 --> 00:42:04.154
WITH THAT, WOULD YOU LIKE TO

00:42:04.221 --> 00:42:05.890
CLOSE? THANK YOU SO MUCH. I

00:42:05.956 --> 00:42:08.592
APPRECIATE THE DIALOG TODAY. YOU

00:42:08.659 --> 00:42:11.528
KNOW, THIS IS A BILL. I THINK

00:42:11.595 --> 00:42:13.097
IT'S I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR

00:42:13.163 --> 00:42:15.266
US TO TAKE ACTION THIS YEAR. WE

00:42:15.332 --> 00:42:16.567
KNOW THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE

00:42:16.634 --> 00:42:19.169
ADDITIONAL DIALOG. IT'S A

00:42:19.236 --> 00:42:20.371
DIFFERENT APPROACH THAN LAST

00:42:20.437 --> 00:42:21.605
YEAR, AND I THINK IT'S ONE

00:42:21.672 --> 00:42:23.107
WORTHY OF SUPPORT. I APPRECIATE

00:42:23.173 --> 00:42:24.408
THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE

00:42:24.475 --> 00:42:25.276

00:45:39.503 --> 00:45:41.905
OUR OPPOSITION TO NEUTRAL, WHICH

00:45:41.972 --> 00:45:44.708
IS VERY EXCITING. SO THIS BILL

00:45:44.775 --> 00:45:46.477
SEEKS TO ADD CONSUMER

00:45:46.543 --> 00:45:48.011
PROTECTIONS, IMPORTANT CONSUMER

00:45:48.078 --> 00:45:49.313
PROTECTIONS FOR CAR PURCHASERS

00:45:49.379 --> 00:45:53.784
AND CAR LEASERS BY CODIFYING THE

00:45:53.851 --> 00:45:55.953
FTC'S CARS RULE AND ESTABLISHING

00:45:56.019 --> 00:45:57.321
A COOLING OFF PERIOD FOR USED

00:45:57.387 --> 00:45:59.022
CARS. LATE LAST YEAR, THE COURT

00:45:59.089 --> 00:46:00.691
OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

00:46:00.757 --> 00:46:02.326
OVERTURNED THE CARS RULE, BUT

00:46:02.392 --> 00:46:03.627
ONLY ON ADMINISTRATIVE GROUNDS.

00:46:03.694 --> 00:46:06.396
WE HAD MANY CALIFORNIANS FILING

00:46:06.463 --> 00:46:07.831
COMMENTS IN FAVOR OF THE FTC'S

00:46:07.898 --> 00:46:09.233
RULE THAT THIS BILL CODIFIES,

00:46:09.299 --> 00:46:11.001
INCLUDING FORMER AUTO SALES

00:46:11.068 --> 00:46:12.102
PERSONNEL, CONSUMERS WHO

00:46:12.169 --> 00:46:13.904
PERSONALLY EXPERIENCED AUTO

00:46:13.971 --> 00:46:19.076
SCAMS, OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL AND,

00:46:19.143 --> 00:46:21.245
YOU KNOW, THE BASICALLY, THIS

00:46:21.311 --> 00:46:24.848
WAS A LOOK AT THE PRICING AND

00:46:24.915 --> 00:46:26.817
ADVERTISING OF CARS AND MAKING

00:46:26.884 --> 00:46:28.519
SURE THAT WE WOULD WE TRY TO

00:46:28.585 --> 00:46:30.521
REFINE OUR RULES TO MAKE THEM

00:46:30.587 --> 00:46:33.423
MORE CONSUMER FRIENDLY. SO WHAT

00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:35.592
IS THE BILL SEEK TO DO? IT WOULD

00:46:35.659 --> 00:46:36.927
PROHIBIT CAR DEALERS FROM

00:46:36.994 --> 00:46:37.561
MISREPRESENTING THE PRICE OF A

00:46:37.628 --> 00:46:39.363
CAR, REQUIRE TRANSPARENCY ON THE

00:46:39.429 --> 00:46:41.265
FULL TOTAL PRICE AND TOTAL

00:46:41.331 --> 00:46:42.733
PAYMENTS. IT REQUIRES THE

00:46:42.799 --> 00:46:44.234
DEALERS TO BE TRANSPARENT ABOUT

00:46:44.301 --> 00:46:45.702
ADD ON SERVICES OR FEATURES THAT

00:46:45.769 --> 00:46:47.337
ARE OPTIONAL, AND PROHIBITS THEM

00:46:47.404 --> 00:46:49.306
FROM CHARGING FOR ADD ONS THAT

00:46:49.373 --> 00:46:50.974
WILL NOT BENEFIT THE CONSUMER,

00:46:51.041 --> 00:46:52.042
AND THEN IT WILL PROVIDE

00:46:52.109 --> 00:46:52.709
ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS FOR

00:46:52.776 --> 00:46:54.545
MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY AND

00:46:54.611 --> 00:46:56.113
VETERANS BY PROHIBITING DEALERS

00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:58.015
FROM MISREPRESENTING AFFILIATION

00:46:58.081 --> 00:46:59.283
WITH THE US GOVERNMENT, STATE

00:46:59.349 --> 00:47:00.384
GOVERNMENT, LOCAL GOVERNMENT, OR

00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:01.852
ANY AGENCY OR DEPARTMENT,

00:47:01.919 --> 00:47:03.287
INCLUDING THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:47:03.353 --> 00:47:06.590
DEFENSE. ADDITIONALLY, THERE ARE

00:47:06.657 --> 00:47:09.092
SOME LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES FOR

00:47:09.159 --> 00:47:12.262
CONSUMERS TO RETURN A CAR UNDER

00:47:12.329 --> 00:47:15.499
CURRENT LAW. EXISTING LAW USES

00:47:15.566 --> 00:47:17.868
ALLOWS FOR CAR PURCHASERS USED

00:47:17.935 --> 00:47:19.503
CAR PURCHASERS TO HAVE THE

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:21.405
ABILITY TO RETURN THEIR CAR ONLY

00:47:21.471 --> 00:47:22.506
IF THEY PRE-PURCHASE THE RIGHT

00:47:22.573 --> 00:47:23.574
TO RETURN IT, BUT THIS

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:24.575
REQUIREMENT IS A STRONG

00:47:24.641 --> 00:47:26.610
DETERRENT IN MANY PURCHASERS ARE

00:47:26.677 --> 00:47:27.311
UNABLE TO MAKE THE ADDITIONAL

00:47:27.377 --> 00:47:28.912
PURCHASE WHEN THEY'RE BUYING THE

00:47:28.979 --> 00:47:30.547
CAR, SO AS TO GIVE CONSUMERS

00:47:30.614 --> 00:47:31.215
TIME TO REVIEW THE PURCHASE

00:47:31.281 --> 00:47:32.883
AGREEMENT CAREFULLY AND FULLY

00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:34.151
INSPECT THE VEHICLE. THE BILL AS

00:47:34.218 --> 00:47:35.586
PROPOSED, THE AMENDMENT CREATES

00:47:35.652 --> 00:47:37.454
AA3 DAY COOLING OFF PERIOD THAT

00:47:37.521 --> 00:47:39.056
DOESN'T REQUIRE CONSUMERS TO

00:47:39.122 --> 00:47:40.490
PRE-PURCHASE THE RETURN PERIOD,

00:47:40.557 --> 00:47:42.226
AND IT WOULD PERMIT DEALERS TO

00:47:42.292 --> 00:47:44.061
CHARGE A RESTOCKING FEE. THE

00:47:44.127 --> 00:47:45.596
COOLING OFF PERIOD INCLUDES SOME

00:47:45.662 --> 00:47:47.030
ADDITIONAL GUARDRAILS BY CAPPING

00:47:47.097 --> 00:47:49.032
THE MAXIMUM VALUE OF THE OF THE

00:47:49.099 --> 00:47:50.434
USED CAR AT $50,000. IT ALSO

00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:52.703
CAPS THE MILEAGE A CONSUMER MAY

00:47:52.769 --> 00:47:55.172
DRIVE, SO THAT FOLKS DON'T GO ON

00:47:55.239 --> 00:47:58.175
SOME JOYRIDE TO VEGAS AND JUST

00:47:58.242 --> 00:48:00.210
EFFECTIVELY RENT IT FOR FREE FOR

00:48:00.277 --> 00:48:01.278
A COUPLE OF DAYS. SO HERE WITH

00:48:01.345 --> 00:48:03.146
ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT

00:48:03.213 --> 00:48:05.983
OF THE BILL IS ROSEMARIE, WHO'S

00:48:06.049 --> 00:48:07.584

00:48:07.651 --> 00:48:10.354
RELIABILITY AND SAFETY. OKAY,

00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:12.723
MADAM CHAIR, TWO MINUTES EACH

00:48:12.789 --> 00:48:13.290
WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE. THANK

00:48:13.357 --> 00:48:14.558
YOU, MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS.

00:48:14.625 --> 00:48:15.959
ROSEMARIE SHAHAN, PRESIDENT OF

00:48:16.026 --> 00:48:17.327
CONSUMERS FOR AUTO RELIABILITY

00:48:17.394 --> 00:48:19.263
AND SAFETY. AND WHILE WE'RE NOT

00:48:19.329 --> 00:48:21.465
THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL BECAUSE

00:48:21.531 --> 00:48:23.533
THE AUTHOR IS THE SPONSOR, WE'VE

00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:26.403
BEEN VERY ACTIVE AND

00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:29.740
ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORTERS. AND WE

00:48:29.806 --> 00:48:31.441
APPLAUD SENATOR ALLEN FOR

00:48:31.508 --> 00:48:32.809
AUTHORING THIS BILL. ACCORDING

00:48:32.876 --> 00:48:35.145
TO THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION,

00:48:35.212 --> 00:48:37.848
JUST THE PARTS OF THE BILL THAT

00:48:37.914 --> 00:48:41.918
EMULATE THE FTC CAR'S RULE ARE

00:48:41.985 --> 00:48:45.522
PROJECTED TO SAVE CAR BUYERS

00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:48.659
$3.4 BILLION A YEAR AND ANOTHER

00:48:48.725 --> 00:48:50.560
72,000,000 HOURS THAT THEY WOULD

00:48:50.627 --> 00:48:51.662
OTHERWISE SPEND HAGGLING OVER

00:48:51.728 --> 00:48:54.131
THE PRICE OF CARS. SO THAT'S A

00:48:54.197 --> 00:48:55.932
REAL BENEFIT RIGHT THERE. AND

00:48:55.999 --> 00:48:57.668
THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT, THE

00:48:57.734 --> 00:49:01.305
BILL HAS PROVISIONS, AS THE

00:49:01.371 --> 00:49:04.608
SENATOR MENTIONED, FOR A KIND OF

00:49:04.675 --> 00:49:07.878
MINI AUTO ESCROW PERIOD, DURING

00:49:07.944 --> 00:49:10.147
WHICH AT LEAST SOME CONSUMERS

00:49:10.213 --> 00:49:12.149
WILL BE ABLE TO GET THE CAR

00:49:12.215 --> 00:49:14.985
INSPECTED, AND IT WILL BENEFIT

00:49:15.052 --> 00:49:17.254
CONSUMERS LIKE WILLIAM BRADLEY,

00:49:17.321 --> 00:49:18.755
WHO TESTIFIED BEFORE THE BILL,

00:49:18.822 --> 00:49:20.891
AND SENATE JUDICIARY, WHO BOUGHT

00:49:20.957 --> 00:49:25.095
A CAR, PAID 10,000 PLUS IN CASH,

00:49:25.162 --> 00:49:27.331
WAS TOLD THAT ALTHOUGH THE

00:49:27.397 --> 00:49:29.499
CARFAX REPORT SAID IT HAD COME

00:49:29.566 --> 00:49:31.201
HERE FROM PENNSYLVANIA, THAT

00:49:31.268 --> 00:49:34.037
RUSS WAS NOT AN ISSUE. AND THEN

00:49:34.104 --> 00:49:36.573
SHORTLY AFTERWARD, HE GOT THE

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:37.808
CAR INSPECTED AND FOUND OUT IT

00:49:37.874 --> 00:49:41.678
WAS SO BADLY RUSTED SOMEONE HAD

00:49:41.745 --> 00:49:44.047
TAKEN DUCT TAPE AND TAPED THE

00:49:44.114 --> 00:49:45.916
UNDERCARRIAGE TOGETHER THAT IT

00:49:45.982 --> 00:49:47.551
HAD MAJOR STRUCTURAL DAMAGE AND

00:49:47.617 --> 00:49:49.186
MADE IT GROSSLY UNSAFE, THE AUTO

00:49:49.252 --> 00:49:50.787
TECH SAID, I'M NOT LETTING YOU

00:49:50.854 --> 00:49:53.256
LEAVE THE LOT IN THIS CAR, BUT

00:49:53.323 --> 00:49:55.359
WHEN HE WENT BACK TO TRY TO GET

00:49:55.425 --> 00:49:57.160
HIS MONEY BACK FROM THE DEALER,

00:49:57.227 --> 00:49:58.462
THE DEALER SAID, WELL, YOU

00:49:58.528 --> 00:50:01.431
BOUGHT IT AS IS, SO YOU'RE STUCK

00:50:01.498 --> 00:50:03.633
AND I WILL BE THRILLED IF THE

00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:06.636
BILL PASSES TO BE ABLE TO TELL

00:50:06.703 --> 00:50:08.739
WILLIAM BRADLEY THAT THE NEXT

00:50:08.805 --> 00:50:10.640
TIME HE GOES TO BUY A CAR, A

00:50:10.707 --> 00:50:13.744
USED CAR, FOR UNDER $50,000, IF

00:50:13.810 --> 00:50:16.213
HE HAS A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE, HE

00:50:16.279 --> 00:50:18.382
CAN GET A REFUND WITHOUT HAVING

00:50:18.448 --> 00:50:20.584
TO GET AN ATTORNEY. IT SHOULD BE

00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:23.387
A RELATIVELY PAINLESS PROCESS

00:50:23.453 --> 00:50:25.522
THAT'S GROUNDBREAKING. NO OTHER

00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:31.027
STATE HAS DONE THIS BEFORE, SO

00:50:31.094 --> 00:50:34.398
WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE CHAIR

00:50:34.464 --> 00:50:36.833
AND THE COUNCIL AND THEIR ROLE

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:41.371
IN BRINGING ABOUT AGREEMENTS.

00:50:41.438 --> 00:50:42.939
I'LL BE HONEST, WE'RE NOT GOING

00:50:43.006 --> 00:50:44.708
TO TOUT IT AS LIKE THE MODEL

00:50:44.775 --> 00:50:46.176
BECAUSE WE WANT TO LIKE TAKE IT

00:50:46.243 --> 00:50:48.245
FOR A TEST DRIVE, MAYBE GIVE IT

00:50:48.311 --> 00:50:51.915
A TUNEUP BEFORE WE URGE OTHER

00:50:51.982 --> 00:50:55.485
STATES TO ADOPT SIMILAR

00:50:55.552 --> 00:50:57.621
LEGISLATION. BUT WE REALLY

00:50:57.687 --> 00:50:58.822
APPRECIATE ALL THE HARD WORK.

00:50:58.889 --> 00:51:00.657
AND ESPECIALLY I WANT TO

00:51:00.724 --> 00:51:02.592
RECOGNIZE SHOSHANA LEVY, WHO'S

00:51:02.659 --> 00:51:07.697

WORKING. SO. OKAY. AND WITH

00:51:16.072 --> 00:51:17.307
THAT, I'D ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

00:51:17.374 --> 00:51:19.242
THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING, MADAM

ALONG WITH A FEW OTHER GROUPS IN

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:33.590
THE NEGOTIATIONS. THIS IS A

00:51:33.657 --> 00:51:34.724
PURCHASE WHERE THERE'S A MAJOR

00:51:34.791 --> 00:51:36.860
POWER IMBALANCE BETWEEN THE

00:51:36.927 --> 00:51:37.994

LEVEL THAT PLAYING FIELD, TO BE

00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:48.705
HONEST. BUT WHAT YOU CAN DO IS

00:51:48.772 --> 00:51:51.241
EMPOWER CONSUMERS TO HAVE MORE

00:51:51.308 --> 00:51:54.244
OPPORTUNITIES AND RIGHTS TO MAKE

00:51:54.311 --> 00:51:56.313
SURE THEY'RE NOT MISLED, AND

00:51:56.379 --> 00:51:58.148
MAKE SURE THAT IF THEY DIDN'T

00:51:58.215 --> 00:51:59.416
GET WHAT THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE

00:51:59.483 --> 00:52:01.351
GETTING, THAT THEY CAN GO BACK.

00:52:01.418 --> 00:52:03.920

WELL, I'M SITTING HERE IN

00:54:45.215 --> 00:54:48.118
PLEASANT ASTONISHMENT. SO YOU

00:54:48.184 --> 00:54:50.153
YOU HAVE BROUGHT THE OPPOSING

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:51.554
FORCES TOGETHER. IF I'M

00:54:51.621 --> 00:54:53.056
UNDERSTANDING THESE COMMENTS

00:54:53.123 --> 00:54:56.526
TOGETHER. SO I GUESS I AM

00:54:56.593 --> 00:54:58.094
SURPRISED. AND IN THE STATE OF

00:54:58.161 --> 00:54:59.529
CALIFORNIA, THERE HAS NOT BEEN A

00:54:59.596 --> 00:55:06.403
USED CAR CONSUMER. SET OF LAWS

00:55:06.469 --> 00:55:10.373
OR LAW EVER. HAS THERE BEEN? IS

00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:13.309
THIS THE FIRST. NO, NO NO NO.

00:55:13.376 --> 00:55:15.245
BUT REGARDING TO USED CAR SALES

00:55:15.311 --> 00:55:16.413
AND RETURNS AND THAT TYPE OF

00:55:16.479 --> 00:55:20.316
THING. BUT THIS IS THIS IS NEW

00:55:20.383 --> 00:55:21.785
NATIONALLY. IS THAT WHAT I JUST

00:55:21.851 --> 00:55:26.790
HEARD. WE'RE YOU KNOW, CERTAINLY

00:55:26.856 --> 00:55:29.092
WE'RE PROUD OF THE OF THE, OF

00:55:29.159 --> 00:55:30.360
THE PROGRESS WE'RE MAKING WITH

00:55:30.427 --> 00:55:32.896
THIS BILL IN TERMS OF CONSUMER

00:55:32.962 --> 00:55:33.496
PROTECTIONS. AND I THINK, YOU

00:55:33.563 --> 00:55:34.864
KNOW, WE'LL SEE WHAT IMPACT THIS

00:55:34.931 --> 00:55:36.866
HAS NATIONALLY. OBVIOUSLY, YOU

00:55:36.933 --> 00:55:39.302
KNOW, THE BILL IS NOT AS STRONG

00:55:39.369 --> 00:55:40.603
AS IT WAS WHEN WE FIRST

00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:43.673
INTRODUCED IT. AND YET I STILL

00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:44.441
BELIEVE IT'S VERY STRONG. AND SO

00:55:44.507 --> 00:55:45.975
I MEAN, DEPENDING ON THE I MEAN,

00:55:46.042 --> 00:55:47.544
I'LL TURN THIS OVER TO OUR

00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:49.446
FRIENDS WHO WORK IN THE CONSUMER

00:55:49.512 --> 00:55:50.747
SPACE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

00:55:50.814 --> 00:55:52.015
OKAY. THAT'S A REALLY GOOD

00:55:52.082 --> 00:55:53.650
QUESTION. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. AND

00:55:53.717 --> 00:55:55.885
THERE IS A CALIFORNIA CAR BUYERS

00:55:55.952 --> 00:55:57.854
BILL OF RIGHTS THAT WAS ENACTED

00:55:57.921 --> 00:56:00.657
IN 2005. THAT WAS A LEGISLATIVE

00:56:00.724 --> 00:56:03.960
COMPROMISE BASED ON BALLOT

00:56:04.027 --> 00:56:06.930
INITIATIVE THAT WERE DRAFTED IT.

00:56:06.996 --> 00:56:08.631
AND WE ENDED UP WITH, INSTEAD OF

00:56:08.698 --> 00:56:11.301
A COOLING OFF PERIOD, WE ENDED

00:56:11.367 --> 00:56:14.771
UP WITH A TWO DAY RETURN OPTION

00:56:14.838 --> 00:56:16.239
THAT CONSUMERS HAD TO PURCHASE

00:56:16.306 --> 00:56:18.341
IN ADVANCE, AND NOBODY WAS

00:56:18.408 --> 00:56:21.344
GETTING IT RIGHT. SO THIS IS

00:56:21.411 --> 00:56:22.645
VERY DIFFERENT BECAUSE THIS IS

00:56:22.712 --> 00:56:25.215
GOING TO BE A THREE DAY RIGHT.

00:56:25.281 --> 00:56:27.617
CONSUMERS WILL HAVE THAT RIGHT.

00:56:27.684 --> 00:56:30.754
AND IN OTHER STATES, VERY OFTEN

00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:32.155
THERE ARE USED CAR LEMON LAWS

00:56:32.222 --> 00:56:33.823
THAT MANDATE THAT DEALERS HAVE

00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:36.426
TO HONOR, OFFER WARRANTIES OF

00:56:36.493 --> 00:56:38.261
VARIOUS LENGTHS DEPENDING ON THE

00:56:38.328 --> 00:56:40.330
COST OF THE CAR OR THE MILEAGE.

00:56:40.396 --> 00:56:42.065
WE THOUGHT, INSTEAD OF THAT

00:56:42.132 --> 00:56:43.500
WHICH YOU OFTEN HAVE TO ENFORCE

00:56:43.566 --> 00:56:45.301
BY GETTING AN ATTORNEY AND GOING

00:56:45.368 --> 00:56:48.338
TO COURT, A COOLING OFF PERIOD

00:56:48.404 --> 00:56:50.473
WHERE YOU COULD JUST SAY, YOU

00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:52.475
KNOW WHAT? THIS ISN'T WORKING

00:56:52.542 --> 00:56:54.344
FOR ME. I'D LIKE TO TAKE IT BACK

00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:56.513
AND GET A REFUND. WOULD GIVE

00:56:56.579 --> 00:56:58.414
PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET

00:56:58.481 --> 00:57:01.785
OUT OF A BAD DEAL FOR WHATEVER

00:57:01.851 --> 00:57:04.087
REASON, WITHOUT HAVING TO GO

00:57:04.154 --> 00:57:05.955
THROUGH THE LEGAL SYSTEM, NOT

00:57:06.022 --> 00:57:08.792
EVEN GOING THROUGH ARBITRATION,

00:57:08.858 --> 00:57:10.260
BUT, YOU KNOW, TRYING TO MAKE

00:57:10.326 --> 00:57:12.762
THAT AS EASY AND PAINLESS AS

00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:14.531
POSSIBLE. WELL, IT MAKES A LOT

00:57:14.597 --> 00:57:16.699
OF SENSE AND THAT YOU'VE BROUGHT

00:57:16.766 --> 00:57:17.634
THE STAKEHOLDERS A NEW CAR, THE

00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:19.169
USED CAR DEALERS, THE CONSUMER

00:57:19.235 --> 00:57:20.637
GROUP TOGETHER, IF I'M

00:57:20.703 --> 00:57:21.938
UNDERSTANDING THAT CORRECTLY.

00:57:22.005 --> 00:57:25.241
YEAH. WELL WELL DONE. ALL RIGHT.

00:57:25.308 --> 00:57:27.143
I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL. AND

00:57:27.210 --> 00:57:28.978
I'M I'M REALLY PLEASED TO SEE

00:57:29.045 --> 00:57:31.581
THAT ALL FORCES CAME TOGETHER TO

00:57:31.648 --> 00:57:33.650
DO GOOD WORK FOR OUR CONSUMERS,

00:57:33.716 --> 00:57:35.018
FOR ALL OF US. WE ALL WILL

00:57:35.084 --> 00:57:36.519
BENEFIT FROM THIS. SO THANK YOU,

00:57:36.586 --> 00:57:38.388
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

00:57:38.454 --> 00:57:40.423
ANYBODY ELSE? OKAY. WELL, I WANT

00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:41.925
TO THANK YOU, SENATOR ALLEN, AND

00:57:41.991 --> 00:57:44.761
ALSO TO YOUR STAFF AND TO THE

00:57:44.828 --> 00:57:48.364
STAFF OF THE COMMITTEE. OFTEN WE

00:57:48.431 --> 00:57:50.300
HEAR EVEN IN WHAT IS THE LAST

00:57:50.366 --> 00:57:52.135
COMMITTEE. OH, WE'LL WORK ON IT

00:57:52.202 --> 00:57:53.770
LATER. AND I ALWAYS THINK BY THE

00:57:53.837 --> 00:57:55.505
LAST COMMITTEE, WE SHOULD HAVE

00:57:55.572 --> 00:57:57.407
BILLS IN A STATE THAT THEY ARE

00:57:57.473 --> 00:57:59.108
READY TO BE SENT TO THE FLOOR.

00:57:59.175 --> 00:58:00.510
AND YOU HAVE DONE THAT WORK. AND

00:58:00.577 --> 00:58:03.446
THAT IS CLEAR. AND I THINK IT IS

00:58:03.513 --> 00:58:04.914
COMMENDABLE BECAUSE YOU SET OUT

00:58:04.981 --> 00:58:07.116
WITH THE GOAL OF PROTECTING

00:58:07.183 --> 00:58:08.284
CONSUMERS FROM TO YOUR POINT,

00:58:08.351 --> 00:58:10.520
WHAT CAN BE A REALLY

00:58:10.587 --> 00:58:12.455
COMPLICATED, HARD AND LARGE

00:58:12.522 --> 00:58:14.757
PURCHASE FOR MANY PEOPLE, THIS

00:58:14.824 --> 00:58:15.959
IS, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE NOT

00:58:16.025 --> 00:58:17.193
HOMEOWNERS. THIS MIGHT BE THE

00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:19.229
LARGEST PURCHASE THEY MAKE. AND

00:58:19.295 --> 00:58:21.598
SO MAKING SURE THAT THEY GET

00:58:21.664 --> 00:58:22.932
WHAT THEY ARE BUYING AND

00:58:22.999 --> 00:58:24.167
INTENDING TO BUY IS CRITICAL.

00:58:24.234 --> 00:58:26.736
AND SO I AGREE WITH THE NOW

00:58:26.803 --> 00:58:29.706
NEUTRAL FORMER OPPOSITION THAT I

00:58:29.772 --> 00:58:31.474
ACTUALLY DO THINK THIS IS A

00:58:31.541 --> 00:58:32.475
MODEL. I THINK YOU ARE PUSHING

00:58:32.542 --> 00:58:33.877
THE BOUNDARIES FOR CONSUMERS

00:58:33.943 --> 00:58:35.445
FURTHER THAN WE'VE SEEN ANYWHERE

00:58:35.511 --> 00:58:36.279
IN THE NATION. IN THE FOURTH

00:58:36.346 --> 00:58:38.348
LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD,

00:58:38.414 --> 00:58:39.949
YOU ARE PROTECTING 40 MILLION

00:58:40.016 --> 00:58:40.850
CONSUMERS. WELL, NOT SO MANY

00:58:40.917 --> 00:58:42.819
BECAUSE SOME OF THOSE ARE KIDS,

00:58:42.886 --> 00:58:45.221
BUT A LOT OF CONSUMERS. AND

00:58:45.288 --> 00:58:46.322
THAT'S REALLY COMMENDABLE. AND I

00:58:46.389 --> 00:58:48.324
THINK YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF THE

00:58:48.391 --> 00:58:50.326
PRODUCT THAT'S COMING OUT OF

00:58:50.393 --> 00:58:50.960
HERE THAT WILL HAVE BIPARTISAN

00:58:51.027 --> 00:58:52.862
SUPPORT, THAT WILL, I BELIEVE,

00:58:52.929 --> 00:58:53.429
BE HOPEFULLY SIGNED BY THE

00:58:53.496 --> 00:58:54.697
GOVERNOR, BECOME LAW FOR

00:58:54.764 --> 00:58:55.999
CALIFORNIANS. AND SO, YOU KNOW,

00:58:56.065 --> 00:58:58.334
I COMMEND YOU ON THAT WORK. AND

00:58:58.401 --> 00:59:00.536
I THINK IT'S WORK I'VE SEEN YOU

00:59:00.603 --> 00:59:01.104
DO OVER THE YEARS. BUT YOU

00:59:01.170 --> 00:59:02.305
CONTINUE TO HOLD STRONG TO YOUR

00:59:02.372 --> 00:59:04.274
GOALS AND ALSO WORK WITH PEOPLE

00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:05.508
TO MAKE SURE IT'S WORKABLE. AND

00:59:05.575 --> 00:59:06.643
THAT IS COMMENDABLE. SO WITH

00:59:06.709 --> 00:59:08.778
THAT, I'M REQUESTING AN AYE

00:59:08.845 --> 00:59:10.246
VOTE. AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO

00:59:10.313 --> 00:59:12.548

00:59:23.159 --> 00:59:24.661
HEARING WAS NOT ANYWHERE NEAR AS

00:59:24.727 --> 00:59:27.697
PLEASANT. AND BECAUSE WE WERE,

00:59:27.764 --> 00:59:30.466
WE WANTED TO MAKE REAL CHANGE IN

00:59:30.533 --> 00:59:33.903
THIS AREA. AND YET, YOU KNOW,

00:59:33.970 --> 00:59:35.505
OUR FRIENDS IN THE OPPOSITION

00:59:35.571 --> 00:59:37.407

00:59:37.473 --> 00:59:38.942
BUSINESS MODEL THAT THEY, THEY

SEEK TO PROTECT FOR ALL SORTS OF

00:59:40.443 --> 00:59:42.912
GOOD REASONS. AND SO THERE'S SO

TO REALLY BANG HEADS TOGETHER AT

00:59:52.288 --> 00:59:54.057
THE END. AND I THINK WE WERE

00:59:54.123 --> 00:59:55.558
GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER

00:59:55.625 --> 00:59:56.125
THROUGH COMMITTEE, THROUGH

CAME TO THE TABLE. AND I DO

01:01:43.232 --> 01:01:44.901
THINK THAT IS WHAT WE SHOULD

01:01:44.967 --> 01:01:46.536
HOPE FOR IN THIS BUILDING IS

01:01:46.602 --> 01:01:47.537
THEY YOU KNOW, THEY SHOWED THAT

01:01:47.603 --> 01:01:48.771
THEY CARED EQUALLY ABOUT THEIR

01:01:48.838 --> 01:01:50.239
CONSUMERS AND THAT THEY WANTED

01:01:50.306 --> 01:01:51.474
TO MOVE THE BALL FORWARD IN A

01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:54.310
WAY NO ONE ELSE HAD. AND I KNOW

01:01:54.377 --> 01:01:55.244
IT WASN'T ALWAYS EASY AND IT

01:01:55.311 --> 01:01:56.746
WASN'T DIDN'T LAND EXACTLY WHERE

01:01:56.813 --> 01:01:58.147
IT STARTED OR WHERE MAYBE YOU

01:01:58.214 --> 01:01:59.182
WOULD HAVE WANTED, BUT THEY

01:01:59.248 --> 01:02:00.983
ABSOLUTELY CAME IN GOOD FAITH

01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:02.452
AND WORKED REALLY HARD. AND I

01:02:02.518 --> 01:02:04.187
THAT IS IMPORTANT TO COMMEND

01:02:04.253 --> 01:02:04.854
THAT. AND I HOPE MORE OPPOSITION

01:02:04.921 --> 01:02:06.189
WILL DO THAT. AND WE FEEL REALLY

01:02:06.255 --> 01:02:08.291

ARE HERE ON TIME? THAT WAS LIKE

01:03:11.053 --> 01:03:13.122
THE FIRST TIME I GOT TO KNOW THE

01:03:13.189 --> 01:03:16.192

01:03:43.085 --> 01:03:45.821

01:04:14.951 --> 01:04:18.487

DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE

01:04:20.756 --> 01:04:22.391
COMMITTEE. I'M PLEASED TO BE

01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:23.292
HERE THIS MORNING. IT'S STILL

01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:26.329
MORNING, ISN'T IT? TO PRESENT SB

01:04:26.395 --> 01:04:28.698
SEVEN, I WANT TO START BY

01:04:28.764 --> 01:04:30.266
THANKING THE CHAIR AND THE

01:04:30.333 --> 01:04:31.500
COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH

01:04:31.567 --> 01:04:33.236
US ON THE AMENDMENTS. WE'VE

01:04:33.302 --> 01:04:34.604
GOTTEN A LOT OF INPUT OVER THE

01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:36.572
LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS, AND WE'VE

01:04:36.639 --> 01:04:37.907
MADE OUR BEST EFFORT TO

01:04:37.974 --> 01:04:39.675
INCORPORATE THAT IN A WAY THAT

01:04:39.742 --> 01:04:41.444
DOESN'T KILL THE INTENT OF THE

01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:45.047
BILL. SB SEVEN PUTS IN PLACE

01:04:45.114 --> 01:04:47.450
COMMON SENSE GUARDRAILS A LITTLE

01:04:47.516 --> 01:04:49.218
OUT OF BREATH AFTER RUNNING OVER

01:04:49.285 --> 01:04:52.722
HERE. EXCUSE ME. WHAT'S THAT?

01:04:52.788 --> 01:04:56.025
NO, NO. I'M GOOD. BUT THE COMMON

01:04:56.092 --> 01:04:57.960
SENSE REQUIRES COMMON SENSE

01:04:58.027 --> 01:04:59.495
GUARDRAILS. IT REQUIRES

01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:02.064
EMPLOYEES TO NOTIFY WORKERS

01:05:02.131 --> 01:05:03.899
BEFORE USING AUTOMATED DECISION

01:05:03.966 --> 01:05:06.702
MAKING SYSTEMS AND EMPLOYMENT

01:05:06.769 --> 01:05:08.771
DECISIONS. NUMBER TWO ENSURES

01:05:08.838 --> 01:05:11.507
THAT THERE'S A HUMAN IN THE LOOP

01:05:11.574 --> 01:05:13.209
FOR DISCIPLINE AND TERMINATION

01:05:13.276 --> 01:05:15.278
DECISIONS. AND THREE, IT BARS

01:05:15.344 --> 01:05:17.947
ADDS AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING

01:05:18.014 --> 01:05:19.715
SYSTEMS FROM PREDICTING WORKERS

01:05:19.782 --> 01:05:22.151
FUTURE BEHAVIOR TO JUSTIFY

01:05:22.218 --> 01:05:24.687
EMPLOYMENT ACTIONS. WE HAVE

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:27.890
WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH ALL THE

01:05:27.957 --> 01:05:29.158
STAKEHOLDERS AS A RESULT OF

01:05:29.225 --> 01:05:31.227
THOSE CONVERSATIONS. THE BILL IS

01:05:31.294 --> 01:05:33.729
NARROWLY FOCUSED AND MUCH MORE

01:05:33.796 --> 01:05:35.064
WORKABLE WHILE KEEPING STRONG

01:05:35.131 --> 01:05:37.033
PROTECTIONS IN PLACE. SO THAT'S

01:05:37.099 --> 01:05:39.268
MY OPENING SALVO. I'M GOING TO

01:05:39.335 --> 01:05:41.237
TURN IT OVER TO MY WITNESS,

01:05:41.304 --> 01:05:42.471
YVONNE FERNANDEZ FROM THE

01:05:42.538 --> 01:05:43.839
CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF LABOR

01:05:43.906 --> 01:05:45.574
UNIONS, AND THEN WE'LL START THE

01:05:45.641 --> 01:05:46.976
DISCUSSION. THANK YOU. GOOD

01:05:47.043 --> 01:05:48.110
MORNING, MADAM CHAIR, AND

01:05:48.177 --> 01:05:49.712
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE, YVONNE

01:05:49.779 --> 01:05:50.713
FERNANDEZ, CALIFORNIA FEDERATION

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.448
OF LABOR UNIONS, PROUD

01:05:52.515 --> 01:05:54.583
CO-SPONSOR OF SB SEVEN AUTOMATED

01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:56.085
DECISION MAKING SYSTEMS, OR ADS,

01:05:56.152 --> 01:05:57.787
AS THIS COMMITTEE IS VERY AWARE,

01:05:57.853 --> 01:06:00.022
MAY BE A NEW TOOL EMPLOYERS HAVE

01:06:00.089 --> 01:06:01.457
AT THEIR DISPOSAL TO SQUEEZE OUT

01:06:01.524 --> 01:06:02.925
EVERY BIT OF PRODUCTIVITY FROM A

01:06:02.992 --> 01:06:03.926
WORKER. HOWEVER, THIS PRACTICE

01:06:03.993 --> 01:06:05.594
IS NOTHING NEW. EMPLOYERS HAVE

01:06:05.661 --> 01:06:06.996
USED SCIENTIFIC MANAGEMENT TO

01:06:07.063 --> 01:06:07.963
SPEED UP, MONITOR AND CONTROL

01:06:08.030 --> 01:06:10.132
WORKERS FOR DECADES. TODAY,

01:06:10.199 --> 01:06:11.967
EMPLOYERS ARE OUTSOURCING

01:06:12.034 --> 01:06:13.369
MANAGEMENT TO AI POWERED SYSTEMS

01:06:13.436 --> 01:06:14.437
CAPABLE OF FIRING AND

01:06:14.503 --> 01:06:15.805
DISCIPLINING A WORKER AND

01:06:15.871 --> 01:06:17.039
DETERMINING HOW MUCH THEY ARE

01:06:17.106 --> 01:06:18.774
PAID. FOR EXAMPLE, AMAZON

01:06:18.841 --> 01:06:20.242
WAREHOUSES USE AN UNPAID TIME

01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:21.310
SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES WORKERS

01:06:21.377 --> 01:06:22.678
WITH A LIMITED AMOUNT OF

01:06:22.745 --> 01:06:24.480
WORKING, LIMITED AMOUNT OF

01:06:24.547 --> 01:06:25.114
NON-WORKING MINUTES THROUGHOUT

01:06:25.181 --> 01:06:27.083
THE DAY. HOWEVER, RATHER THAN

01:06:27.149 --> 01:06:29.185
PROVIDING THAT SET FLEXIBILITY,

01:06:29.251 --> 01:06:30.386
WORKERS HAVE REPORTED THAT THE

01:06:30.453 --> 01:06:31.587
SYSTEM IS USED TO AUTOMATICALLY

01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:33.189
GENERATE PAPERWORK TO FIRE THEM

01:06:33.255 --> 01:06:35.324
IF THEY USE UP A CERTAIN AMOUNT

01:06:35.391 --> 01:06:36.292
OF MINUTES OF THEIR ALLOTTED

01:06:36.359 --> 01:06:38.260
TIME. WORKERS CAN BE FIRED EVEN

01:06:38.327 --> 01:06:39.695
IF THEY'RE TEN MINUTES LATE

01:06:39.762 --> 01:06:41.030
BECAUSE OF CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE A

01:06:41.097 --> 01:06:42.998
SICK CHILD OR A TRAFFIC JAM. ADS

01:06:43.065 --> 01:06:44.266
IS INCAPABLE OF MAKING THOSE

01:06:44.333 --> 01:06:46.202
NUANCED DECISIONS. ANOTHER RISK

01:06:46.268 --> 01:06:48.537
OF UNSUPERVISED ADS USAGE IS THE

01:06:48.604 --> 01:06:50.406
POTENTIAL FOR BIAS AND

01:06:50.473 --> 01:06:51.841
DISCRIMINATION BUILT INTO THE

01:06:51.907 --> 01:06:53.175
SYSTEMS. TECHNOLOGY IS NOT FREE

01:06:53.242 --> 01:06:55.344
OF BIASES AND THE FLAWS OF THE

01:06:55.411 --> 01:06:56.512
HUMANS THAT CREATE THEM. HUMAN

01:06:56.579 --> 01:06:57.546
BIASES CAN ALSO BE BUILT INTO

01:06:57.613 --> 01:06:58.948
THE CORE OF THE TECHNOLOGY

01:06:59.014 --> 01:07:00.182
THROUGH TRAINING, DATA AND THE

01:07:00.249 --> 01:07:02.318
ALGORITHM ITSELF. THIS RISK IS

01:07:02.385 --> 01:07:03.219
WORSENED WHEN THESE TOOLS ARE

01:07:03.285 --> 01:07:05.154
USED TO PREDICT FUTURE BEHAVIOR,

01:07:05.221 --> 01:07:07.390
RATHER THAN JUST ANALYZING PAST

01:07:07.456 --> 01:07:08.157
PERFORMANCES. JUST BEING FLAGGED

01:07:08.224 --> 01:07:10.226
AS A RISK CAN IMPACT WORKERS

01:07:10.292 --> 01:07:12.027
ABILITY TO GET GOOD SHIFTS OR

01:07:12.094 --> 01:07:13.396
RAISE, OR PUT THEM AT RISK OF

01:07:13.462 --> 01:07:15.097
TERMINATION SIMPLY BECAUSE OF AN

01:07:15.164 --> 01:07:17.099
ALGORITHM. SB SEVEN REQUIRES

01:07:17.166 --> 01:07:18.467
HUMAN OVERSIGHT OF MACHINE

01:07:18.534 --> 01:07:19.935
MANAGEMENT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS

01:07:20.002 --> 01:07:21.370
AS DESCRIBED BY THE SENATOR, AND

01:07:21.437 --> 01:07:23.639
FOR THESE REASONS, WE STRONGLY

01:07:23.706 --> 01:07:24.874
URGE YOUR VOTE AT THE

01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:26.642
APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU.

01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:28.944
THANK YOU. ANYBODY ELSE HERE IN

01:07:29.011 --> 01:07:30.279

01:07:34.683 --> 01:07:36.152
WAIT. THE MIC'S NOT ON. COME

01:07:36.218 --> 01:07:39.288

01:08:43.352 --> 01:08:45.187
THOUGHT MAYBE YOU WERE COMING UP

TO ONE MORE SUPPORT, BUT YOU

01:08:46.522 --> 01:08:48.891

AFTER AFTER LAST NIGHT'S

01:08:56.065 --> 01:08:58.567
JUDICIARY Ó I APPRECIATE THAT

01:08:58.634 --> 01:09:01.003
WE APPRECIATE SPEED. IF ANYBODY

01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:02.404
REMEMBERS HOW QUICKLY I SPOKE

01:09:02.471 --> 01:09:05.441
WHEN I WAS PRESIDING OFFICER, WE

01:09:05.508 --> 01:09:08.611
APPRECIATED IT. GOOD MORNING,

01:09:08.677 --> 01:09:10.479
MADAM CHAIR. MEMBERS, CHRIS

01:09:10.546 --> 01:09:11.881
MICHELI, ON BEHALF OF THE

01:09:11.947 --> 01:09:14.016
SOCIETY FOR HUMAN RESOURCE

01:09:14.083 --> 01:09:16.151
MANAGEMENT. AS THE SENATOR KNOWS

01:09:16.218 --> 01:09:18.120
FROM OUR TESTIMONY IN HIS HOUSE

01:09:18.187 --> 01:09:20.956
AS WELL AS EARLIER HERE, WE DO

01:09:21.023 --> 01:09:22.324
APPRECIATE THE CONTINUED

01:09:22.391 --> 01:09:24.493
ENGAGEMENT OF HIM AND THE

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.729
FEDERATION OF LABOR UNIONS

01:09:26.795 --> 01:09:28.697
WANTED TO WE WANT TO BE CLEAR,

01:09:28.764 --> 01:09:29.665
WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO PROVIDING

01:09:29.732 --> 01:09:31.901
EMPLOYEE NOTICES WITH ADS THAT

01:09:31.967 --> 01:09:33.769
ARE USED IN SIGNIFICANT WAYS IN

01:09:33.836 --> 01:09:37.439
THE WORKPLACE. OUR CONCERN IS,

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:39.275
FIRST, THAT SB SEVEN REQUIRES

01:09:39.341 --> 01:09:40.643
NOTICES TO BOTH EMPLOYEES AND

01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:42.545
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS WHEN ADS

01:09:42.611 --> 01:09:45.047
IS USED AT ALL, NO MATTER HOW

01:09:45.114 --> 01:09:46.882
MINIMAL IT IS. FOR EXAMPLE,

01:09:46.949 --> 01:09:49.385
INCLUDING SCHEDULING, TASK

01:09:49.451 --> 01:09:51.854
ALLOCATIONS, ETC, WITH

01:09:51.921 --> 01:09:53.255
PARTICULAR CONCERN ABOUT

01:09:53.322 --> 01:09:55.190
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS.

01:09:55.257 --> 01:09:56.525
IRONICALLY, IN THE DEFINITION OF

01:09:56.592 --> 01:09:58.794
WORKER IN THE BILL, IT TALKS

01:09:58.861 --> 01:10:00.429
ABOUT DIRECTION AND CONTROL,

01:10:00.496 --> 01:10:02.197
WHICH OF COURSE IS A TRADITIONAL

01:10:02.264 --> 01:10:04.500
DEFINITION OF EMPLOYEE. BUT

01:10:04.567 --> 01:10:06.268
LATER IN THE DEFINITION OF

01:10:06.335 --> 01:10:08.470
WORKER, IT INCLUDES INDEPENDENT

01:10:08.537 --> 01:10:10.506
CONTRACTORS. THE SECOND IS IN

01:10:10.573 --> 01:10:14.510
SECTION 1522 SUBDIVISIONS A AND

01:10:14.577 --> 01:10:16.579
B, THE LENGTH OF THIS NOTICE

01:10:16.645 --> 01:10:18.180
THAT'S OUTLINED IN THOSE TWO

01:10:18.247 --> 01:10:19.148
PROVISIONS, WE THINK,

01:10:19.214 --> 01:10:20.316
PARTICULARLY FOR A LARGE

01:10:20.382 --> 01:10:22.484
EMPLOYER, IS GOING TO BE VERY

01:10:22.551 --> 01:10:23.419
SIGNIFICANT AND FEAR THAT IT

01:10:23.485 --> 01:10:25.487
WILL TURN INTO WHAT MANY OF US

01:10:25.554 --> 01:10:28.223
VIEW AS PROP 65 WARNINGS. WE

01:10:28.290 --> 01:10:30.492
SIMPLY BYPASS THEM. THE OTHER

01:10:30.559 --> 01:10:33.295
ITEM IS IN PROPOSED SECTION 1524

01:10:33.362 --> 01:10:36.031
Ã THREE, WHERE IT INCLUDES A

01:10:36.098 --> 01:10:37.866
COMPLETE BAN ON PREDICTIVE

01:10:37.933 --> 01:10:40.569
BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS. AND WE THINK

01:10:40.636 --> 01:10:42.504
THAT THAT INCORRECTLY ASSUMES

01:10:42.571 --> 01:10:44.206
THAT THIS IS ALWAYS USED FOR

01:10:44.273 --> 01:10:46.875
SOME SORT OF NEFARIOUS PURPOSE

01:10:46.942 --> 01:10:48.544
IN MANY INSTANCES. FOR EXAMPLE,

01:10:48.611 --> 01:10:50.913
A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION THAT IS

01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:53.048
TRYING TO COMBAT CONSUMER FRAUD,

01:10:53.115 --> 01:10:54.450
OBVIOUSLY THEIR EMPLOYEES ARE

01:10:54.516 --> 01:10:56.251
GOING TO HAVE ACCESS TO CONSUMER

01:10:56.318 --> 01:10:58.420
ACCOUNTS. AND SO EVEN IF A FLAG

01:10:58.487 --> 01:11:01.991
IS ISSUED BY AN AD AND IS FULLY

01:11:02.057 --> 01:11:03.225
INVESTIGATED, THAT INITIAL FLAG

01:11:03.292 --> 01:11:04.893
COULD BE UNLAWFUL UNDER THIS

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:06.362
BILL. SO FOR THESE REASONS, WE

01:11:06.428 --> 01:11:08.364
CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN AND OPPOSE,

01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:09.698
UNLESS AMENDED, A POSITION ON

01:11:09.765 --> 01:11:11.100
THE BILL. MADAM CHAIR, THANK

01:11:11.166 --> 01:11:13.602
YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING.

01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:15.104
ASHLEY HOFFMAN, ON BEHALF OF THE

01:11:15.170 --> 01:11:16.639
CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE,

01:11:16.705 --> 01:11:18.407
I WANT TO ECHO THE THANK YOU TO

01:11:18.474 --> 01:11:19.675
THE AUTHOR AND STAFF AND THE

01:11:19.742 --> 01:11:20.242
SPONSORS FOR ALL THE

01:11:20.309 --> 01:11:22.678
CONVERSATIONS ON THIS BILL. AND

01:11:22.745 --> 01:11:24.513
WHAT WE'VE SAID FROM THE

01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:25.180
BEGINNING IS WE ABSOLUTELY AGREE

01:11:25.247 --> 01:11:26.148
THAT A HUMAN SHOULD BE IN THE

01:11:26.215 --> 01:11:27.316
LOOP WHEN YOU'RE MAKING

01:11:27.383 --> 01:11:28.684
CONSEQUENTIAL DECISIONS LIKE A

01:11:28.751 --> 01:11:29.585
DISCIPLINE OR TERMINATION FROM A

01:11:29.652 --> 01:11:30.386
LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT

01:11:30.452 --> 01:11:31.520
PERSPECTIVE, THAT ABSOLUTELY

01:11:31.587 --> 01:11:33.022
MAKES SENSE. I THINK ONE OF OUR

01:11:33.088 --> 01:11:35.457
CONCERNS HERE IS THAT THE BILL,

01:11:35.524 --> 01:11:36.592
ESPECIALLY THE APPEAL, RIGHT,

01:11:36.659 --> 01:11:37.726
FOR EXAMPLE, IS FOCUSED A LOT

01:11:37.793 --> 01:11:39.561
MORE ON WHAT HAPPENS AFTERWARDS,

01:11:39.628 --> 01:11:40.529
NOT ENSURING THAT WE'RE HAVING

01:11:40.596 --> 01:11:42.398
THAT HUMAN IN THE LOOP ELEMENT

01:11:42.464 --> 01:11:43.499
UP FRONT. AGAIN, I THINK THAT'S

01:11:43.565 --> 01:11:45.401
REALLY WHERE WE THINK THE FOCUS

01:11:45.467 --> 01:11:47.369
OF THE BILL SHOULD BE. I KNOW

01:11:47.436 --> 01:11:48.570
THERE'S A RECENT AMENDMENT TO

01:11:48.637 --> 01:11:50.639
THE APPEAL, RIGHT. AND I I'VE

01:11:50.706 --> 01:11:51.173
ASKED BUT HAVEN'T GOTTEN

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:52.241
COMPLETE CLARIFICATION ON THIS.

01:11:52.307 --> 01:11:54.510
BUT TO ME, IT STILL READS THAT

01:11:54.576 --> 01:11:56.779
EVEN IF AN ADZ IS USED AT ALL,

01:11:56.845 --> 01:11:57.546
NO MATTER HOW MINIMALLY, THAT

01:11:57.613 --> 01:11:59.314
WOULD TRIGGER THE APPEAL, RIGHT?

01:11:59.381 --> 01:12:00.549
EVEN IF THERE WAS, FOR EXAMPLE,

01:12:00.616 --> 01:12:02.284
A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION

01:12:02.351 --> 01:12:03.152
PERFORMED. AND SO WE DO HAVE

01:12:03.218 --> 01:12:04.787
SOME CONCERN FROM THAT

01:12:04.853 --> 01:12:05.621
PERSPECTIVE OF THE PRECEDENT.

01:12:05.688 --> 01:12:07.589
AND AGAIN, THE IMPLICATIONS THAT

01:12:07.656 --> 01:12:08.223
COULD HAVE ON BROADER LABOR AND

01:12:08.290 --> 01:12:09.825
EMPLOYMENT LAW. WE ARE ALSO

01:12:09.892 --> 01:12:10.826
CONCERNED STILL ABOUT THE

01:12:10.893 --> 01:12:12.294
PROVISIONS STATING THAT ADS CAN

01:12:12.361 --> 01:12:13.996
NEVER BE RELIED ON, QUOTE,

01:12:14.063 --> 01:12:15.898
PRIMARILY FOR DISCIPLINARY

01:12:15.964 --> 01:12:18.133
PURPOSES, NO MATTER HOW HOW

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:19.468
IMPEACHABLE IT IS, HOW MUCH

01:12:19.535 --> 01:12:20.302
TESTING, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU'VE

01:12:20.369 --> 01:12:22.037
DONE ON THAT. AND ONE OF THE

01:12:22.104 --> 01:12:23.038
ISSUES WE HAVE IMPLEMENTATION

01:12:23.105 --> 01:12:24.640
WISE IS, IS WORKERS CAN'T ALWAYS

01:12:24.707 --> 01:12:26.408
BE OBSERVED AT ALL TIMES. AND SO

01:12:26.475 --> 01:12:28.377
WE HAVE TO RELY ON TOOLS, FOR

01:12:28.444 --> 01:12:29.311
EXAMPLE, SOMETIMES FOR SAFETY IN

01:12:29.378 --> 01:12:31.313
THE WORKPLACE, IF THE SAME

01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:32.514
WORKER IS REPEATEDLY FLAGGED BY

01:12:32.581 --> 01:12:34.083
A TOOL FOR UNSAFE DRIVING. AS I

01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:35.984
READ THIS BILL, I AM NOT SURE

01:12:36.051 --> 01:12:37.853
THAT MY MEMBERS COULD DISCIPLINE

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:38.887
FOR THAT. WE WOULD, FOR EXAMPLE,

01:12:38.954 --> 01:12:40.155
HAVE TO HAVE SOMEONE MAYBE DRIVE

01:12:40.222 --> 01:12:41.557
ALONG WITH THEM CONSTANTLY, OR

01:12:41.623 --> 01:12:43.292
SOME OTHER MEANS OR OR

01:12:43.358 --> 01:12:44.193
MEASUREMENTS OF PRODUCTIVITY.

01:12:44.259 --> 01:12:45.794
AND I KNOW THAT CAN GET

01:12:45.861 --> 01:12:46.361
CONTROVERSIAL, BUT THERE ARE

01:12:46.428 --> 01:12:48.530
SOME LEGITIMATE USES WHERE ADS

01:12:48.597 --> 01:12:50.432
CAN FLAG IF NOTHING IS BEING

01:12:50.499 --> 01:12:52.801
DONE BY A WORKER. OR AGAIN,

01:12:52.868 --> 01:12:55.137
THERE'S POTENTIAL RISKS OF

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:57.239
UNSAFE BEHAVIOR. SO AGAIN, WE'RE

01:12:57.306 --> 01:12:58.807
NOT OPPOSED TO A LEVEL OF

01:12:58.874 --> 01:12:59.475
CORROBORATION, BUT HAVE SOME

01:12:59.541 --> 01:13:01.243
CONCERN ABOUT THE USE OF THE

01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:02.444
PRIMARILY LANGUAGE IN THE BILL.

01:13:02.511 --> 01:13:04.246
AND THEN FINALLY IS THE ACCESS

01:13:04.313 --> 01:13:05.247
TO ACCESS RIGHTS AND THE

01:13:05.314 --> 01:13:06.315
CORRECTION RIGHTS. AS I READ

01:13:06.381 --> 01:13:08.617
THIS BILL, IT APPLIES TO ALL LOW

01:13:08.684 --> 01:13:10.552
RISK USES, BECAUSE IT IS

01:13:10.619 --> 01:13:11.653
GOVERNED BY THAT DEFINITION OF

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:12.955
AN EMPLOYMENT RELATED DECISION,

01:13:13.021 --> 01:13:14.256
WHICH COVERS THINGS LIKE

01:13:14.323 --> 01:13:15.491
SCHEDULING TASK ALLOCATION. AS

01:13:15.557 --> 01:13:17.025
MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED, I KNOW

01:13:17.092 --> 01:13:18.427
THE PROPONENTS IN THE ANALYSIS

01:13:18.494 --> 01:13:19.495
SAID, YOU KNOW, OUR ARGUMENT ON

01:13:19.561 --> 01:13:21.130
THIS DOESN'T STAND BECAUSE THEY

01:13:21.196 --> 01:13:22.865
ASSUME A WORKER IS NOT LIKELY TO

01:13:22.931 --> 01:13:24.433
REQUEST OR ACCESS DATA UNLESS

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:25.701
THERE'S APPEAL. BUT AGAIN, IT'S

01:13:25.768 --> 01:13:28.003
NOT ACTUALLY THAT LIMITED. SO

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:29.538
AGAIN, YOU KNOW, WE REALLY

01:13:29.605 --> 01:13:30.305
BELIEVE THAT THE BETTER APPROACH

01:13:30.372 --> 01:13:32.141
HERE IS, AGAIN, WE'RE FOCUSED ON

01:13:32.207 --> 01:13:34.676
KIND OF HAVING THAT HUMAN

01:13:34.743 --> 01:13:35.277
INVOLVEMENT UP FRONT. I KNOW

01:13:35.344 --> 01:13:36.278

WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DÍAS.

01:15:20.315 --> 01:15:23.886
QUESTIONS? OH, YEAH. WELL, THANK

01:15:23.952 --> 01:15:25.320
YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I

01:15:25.387 --> 01:15:26.722
THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

01:15:26.788 --> 01:15:29.725
IS THAT THAT WE THAT WE'RE

01:15:29.791 --> 01:15:31.326
PRUDENT AND PUT A PERSON IN THE

01:15:31.393 --> 01:15:33.061
LOOP WHEN THESE AUTOMATED

01:15:33.128 --> 01:15:34.630
DECISIONS ARE MADE. BUT COULD

01:15:34.696 --> 01:15:37.432
YOU ANSWER A COUPLE OF I MEAN,

01:15:37.499 --> 01:15:39.701
WE DEFINITELY HEARD A LOT OF

01:15:39.768 --> 01:15:43.038
ISSUES, A LOT OF OPPOSITION

01:15:43.105 --> 01:15:45.407
BROUGHT UP, BUT COULD YOU TALK

01:15:45.474 --> 01:15:48.610
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT BANNING ALL

01:15:48.677 --> 01:15:50.879
PREDICTIVE BEHAVIOR THERE? THERE

01:15:50.946 --> 01:15:54.349
COULD BE, AGAIN, SOME INSTANCES

01:15:54.416 --> 01:15:56.218
WHERE BEING ABLE TO PREDICT

01:15:56.285 --> 01:15:58.820
BEHAVIOR COULD BE USEFUL TO

01:15:58.887 --> 01:16:02.291
PROTECT EMPLOYEES. AND I THINK

01:16:02.357 --> 01:16:04.960
THAT THAT WAS MENTIONED WITH,

01:16:05.027 --> 01:16:08.430
WITH THE. LOOKING AT THE SPEED

01:16:08.497 --> 01:16:11.733
OF A CAR. AND THEN ALSO IF YOU

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:15.971
HAVE A PERSON IN THE LOOP IS IT

01:16:16.038 --> 01:16:18.373
REDUNDANT TO NOW SAY YOU CAN THE

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:21.777
EMPLOYEE CAN STILL APPEAL THE,

01:16:21.843 --> 01:16:23.812
THE EMPLOYMENT DECISION BECAUSE

01:16:23.879 --> 01:16:26.014
I SEE IT AND I KNOW THIS WAS ALL

01:16:26.081 --> 01:16:27.349
BROUGHT UP BY THE OPPOSITION,

01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:29.418
BUT IT MIGHT BE FOR A SMALL

01:16:29.484 --> 01:16:30.052
BUSINESS THAT THE PERSON THAT

01:16:30.118 --> 01:16:32.187
WAS IN THE LOOP MIGHT BE THE

01:16:32.254 --> 01:16:33.522
ONLY PERSON THERE. AND YOU HAVE

01:16:33.588 --> 01:16:35.190
TO GET A SECOND PERSON THAT THAT

01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:36.892
THE EMPLOYEE COULD APPEAL TO. SO

01:16:36.959 --> 01:16:38.260
COULD WOULD YOU MIND JUST

01:16:38.327 --> 01:16:39.795
ADDRESSING SOME OF THE ITEMS

01:16:39.861 --> 01:16:40.963
THAT WERE BROUGHT UP? WELL, I

01:16:41.029 --> 01:16:42.898
THINK I'LL ADDRESS THE FIRST.

01:16:42.965 --> 01:16:45.233
THE SECOND ITEM FIRST IS HAVING

01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:46.969
A HUMAN IN THE LOOP. IT'S KIND

01:16:47.035 --> 01:16:48.337
OF A IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT

01:16:48.403 --> 01:16:50.872
TO GET THAT EXACTLY RIGHT. BUT

01:16:50.939 --> 01:16:53.742
WE'VE WORKED WITH BOTH SIDES OF

01:16:53.809 --> 01:16:55.978
THE ISSUE AND WE'VE WE'VE COME

01:16:56.044 --> 01:16:58.847
DOWN PRETTY WELL ON THAT. SO

01:16:58.914 --> 01:17:00.649
EVEN IF THERE IS A HUMAN

01:17:00.716 --> 01:17:03.785
INVOLVED IN THE IN, IN

01:17:03.852 --> 01:17:06.321
OVERSEEING A PROCESS, THEN

01:17:06.388 --> 01:17:08.090
THERE'S MISTAKES THAT CAN BE

01:17:08.156 --> 01:17:11.026
MADE, ESPECIALLY IF THE PERSON

01:17:11.093 --> 01:17:13.161
HAS TOO MUCH OF THE AUTOMATED

01:17:13.228 --> 01:17:15.130
SYSTEM. SO IN OTHER WORDS, IF

01:17:15.197 --> 01:17:18.867
YOU HAVE A PERSON SUPPOSEDLY

01:17:18.934 --> 01:17:20.669
OVERSEEING, TASKED WITH

01:17:20.736 --> 01:17:21.770
OVERSEEING AND AN AUTOMATED

01:17:21.837 --> 01:17:24.373
DECISION MAKING SYSTEM, MAKING

01:17:24.439 --> 01:17:26.241
DECISION WITHOUT REALLY THAT

01:17:26.308 --> 01:17:28.276
MUCH OVERSIGHT, THEN I THINK

01:17:28.343 --> 01:17:30.078
MISTAKES CAN BE MADE AND PEOPLE

01:17:30.145 --> 01:17:32.581
CAN BE HARMED. SO I THINK IT'S

01:17:32.647 --> 01:17:34.850
IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT NECESSARY

01:17:34.916 --> 01:17:37.352
HUMAN IN THE LOOP, PART OF THE

01:17:37.419 --> 01:17:40.856
PART OF THE PART OF THE PROCESS.

01:17:40.922 --> 01:17:42.491
AND THE OTHER QUESTION, I THINK

01:17:42.557 --> 01:17:44.993
I'M GOING TO TURN THAT OVER TO

01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:46.495
MY WITNESS. YVONNE, THANK YOU

01:17:46.561 --> 01:17:48.296
FOR THE QUESTION. ASSEMBLY

01:17:48.363 --> 01:17:50.298
MEMBERS. SO REGARDING PREDICTIVE

01:17:50.365 --> 01:17:51.600
ANALYSIS, YOU KNOW, WE

01:17:51.666 --> 01:17:53.168
UNDERSTAND THE NEED AND THE

01:17:53.235 --> 01:17:54.970
DESIRE FOR EMPLOYERS TO ANALYZE

01:17:55.037 --> 01:17:56.705
DATA. AND WE DEFINITELY DON'T

01:17:56.772 --> 01:17:58.373
PREVENT THAT THROUGH THIS BILL.

01:17:58.440 --> 01:17:59.708
WHERE PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS CAN

01:17:59.775 --> 01:18:01.510
GET DIFFICULT IS THERE CAN BE A

01:18:01.576 --> 01:18:02.811
VARIETY OF PIECES OF

01:18:02.878 --> 01:18:03.912
INFORMATION. SO FOR EXAMPLE, IF

01:18:03.979 --> 01:18:05.414
AN EMPLOYER WANTS TO DETERMINE

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:07.149
WHETHER OR NOT A WORKER IS

01:18:07.215 --> 01:18:08.417
LIKELY TO COMMIT FRAUD, THEY CAN

01:18:08.483 --> 01:18:10.285
PUT, LET'S SAY, THEIR CREDIT

01:18:10.352 --> 01:18:11.219
SCORE OR LET'S SAY THEIR INCOME

01:18:11.286 --> 01:18:12.621
LEVEL OR WHERE THEY WHERE THEY

01:18:12.687 --> 01:18:14.256
LIVE. AND ALL OF THESE THINGS

01:18:14.322 --> 01:18:16.158
CAN OR THESE METRICS OR PIECES

01:18:16.224 --> 01:18:16.825
OF INFORMATION CAN FURTHER

01:18:16.892 --> 01:18:17.993
EXACERBATE BIASES OF WHO IS

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:20.462
LIKELY TO COMMIT WHAT TYPE OF

01:18:20.529 --> 01:18:22.264
CRIMES OR OR ACTIONS IN THE

01:18:22.330 --> 01:18:23.732
WORKPLACE. SO OUR HESITANCY IS

01:18:23.799 --> 01:18:25.500
TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE BIASES

01:18:25.567 --> 01:18:27.335
AREN'T EXACERBATED BY PREDICTIVE

01:18:27.402 --> 01:18:29.905
BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS. I KNOW I

01:18:29.971 --> 01:18:32.374
TOTALLY GET THAT PART. AND IN

01:18:32.441 --> 01:18:33.508
SUPPORT OF THAT, I'M JUST

01:18:33.575 --> 01:18:35.911
TALKING ABOUT IF YOU HAVE A

01:18:35.977 --> 01:18:37.045
PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS THAT WOULD

01:18:37.112 --> 01:18:38.747
PREDICT THAT AN EMPLOYEE IS

01:18:38.814 --> 01:18:40.615
LIKELY TO GET HURT BECAUSE

01:18:40.682 --> 01:18:42.084
THEY'RE DRIVING TOO FAST, FOR

01:18:42.150 --> 01:18:45.387
INSTANCE, SO ARE YOU PREVENTING

01:18:45.454 --> 01:18:47.956
ARE YOU PREVENTING THAT TYPE OF

01:18:48.023 --> 01:18:51.293
ANALYSIS BY BANNING THAT

01:18:51.359 --> 01:18:52.327
PREDICTIVE, IF I MAY, THROUGH

01:18:52.394 --> 01:18:55.063
THE CHAIR RESPOND? NO. SO IN

01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:56.898
THOSE INSTANCES, LIKE IN THE

01:18:56.965 --> 01:18:57.833
DRIVING EXAMPLE, THE EMPLOYER

01:18:57.899 --> 01:18:59.734
WOULD HAVE ALL THOSE LOGS OF,

01:18:59.801 --> 01:19:01.703
YOU KNOW, THE SYSTEM CATCHING

01:19:01.770 --> 01:19:03.805
THAT PERSON GOING OVER THE SPEED

01:19:03.872 --> 01:19:05.607
LIMIT, BREAKING THE LAW WHILE

01:19:05.674 --> 01:19:06.741
THEY'RE DRIVING. AND SO THE

01:19:06.808 --> 01:19:08.043
EMPLOYER THEMSELVES CAN

01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:09.144
DETERMINE, WELL, THEY'VE BROKEN

01:19:09.211 --> 01:19:10.979
THE LAW A FEW TIMES IN THESE

01:19:11.046 --> 01:19:12.347
INSTANCES. THAT ITSELF WARRANTS,

01:19:12.414 --> 01:19:14.182
YOU KNOW, AN ACTION FROM THE

01:19:14.249 --> 01:19:15.817
EMPLOYER TO THE WORKER. SO IT'S

01:19:15.884 --> 01:19:17.752
NOT NECESSARILY ELIMINATING THAT

01:19:17.819 --> 01:19:19.087
ABILITY TO SAY YOU'VE ALREADY

01:19:19.154 --> 01:19:20.755
BROKEN THE LAW A FEW TIMES.

01:19:20.822 --> 01:19:22.357
LET'S TAKE AN ACTION. LET'S, YOU

01:19:22.424 --> 01:19:24.059
KNOW, JUST CAN'T USE THAT TO

01:19:24.126 --> 01:19:26.328
PREDICT FUTURE BEHAVIOR. IS WHAT

01:19:26.394 --> 01:19:31.466
YOU'RE SAYING CORRECT? OKAY.

01:19:31.533 --> 01:19:32.868
THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER I

01:19:32.934 --> 01:19:35.403
JUST ALSO WANT TO MENTION THAT

01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:36.838
WE'RE STILL OPEN TO FINDING

01:19:36.905 --> 01:19:38.573
LANGUAGE ON ON THE ISSUES THAT

01:22:38.853 --> 01:22:41.856
TIME MONITORING AND HUMAN REVIEW

01:22:41.923 --> 01:22:44.225

ALIGNED WITH THE GOVERNOR'S

SUPPORT OF SB 833. SB 833

01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:30.772
ESTABLISHES HUMAN OVERSIGHT

01:23:30.839 --> 01:23:32.507
REQUIREMENTS, WHICH I THINK ARE

01:23:32.574 --> 01:23:34.476
CRITICAL. IF YOU'RE WONDERING

01:23:34.542 --> 01:23:36.111

01:23:36.177 --> 01:23:38.613
YOU THIS FROM MONDAY'S MIT

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:40.448
TECHNOLOGY REVIEW. CALIFORNIA IS

01:23:40.515 --> 01:23:42.283
SET TO BECOME THE FIRST US STATE

01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:44.786
TO MANAGE POWER OUTAGES WITH AI.

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:46.287
I'M SURE IT COMES AS A SURPRISE

01:23:46.354 --> 01:23:48.022
TO MANY PEOPLE HERE. IT

01:23:48.089 --> 01:23:49.357
CERTAINLY CAME AS A SURPRISE TO

01:23:49.424 --> 01:23:51.926
ME, AND THE USE OF GENERATIVE AI

01:23:51.993 --> 01:23:54.496
IN THIS ENVIRONMENT IS WITHOUT A

01:23:54.562 --> 01:23:57.265
PROPER GUARDRAILS IS GOING TO BE

01:23:57.332 --> 01:23:59.134
POTENTIALLY VERY PROBLEMATIC

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:00.535
WITHOUT PROPER OVERSIGHT,

01:24:00.602 --> 01:24:02.370
ASSESSMENT AND TRANSPARENCY

01:24:02.437 --> 01:24:03.938
MECHANISMS, AI SYSTEMS OPERATING

01:24:04.005 --> 01:24:05.306
IN THESE CRITICAL SECTORS COULD

01:24:05.373 --> 01:24:06.508
MAKE CONSEQUENTIAL DECISIONS

01:24:06.574 --> 01:24:09.310
WITHOUT HUMAN REVIEW OR WORSE.

01:24:09.377 --> 01:24:10.578
THERE'S ALSO CONCERN THAT

01:24:10.645 --> 01:24:12.280
UNMONITORED AI COULD TAKE RISKS

01:24:12.347 --> 01:24:14.048
THAT COULD POTENTIALLY ESCALATE.

01:24:14.115 --> 01:24:15.450
IN THIS PARTICULAR EXAMPLE, THE

01:24:15.517 --> 01:24:17.986
ONE WITH THE ARTICLE I JUST

01:24:18.052 --> 01:24:19.354
CITED, THEY'RE PLANNING TO USE

01:24:19.421 --> 01:24:20.321
GENERATIVE AI. SO YOU CAN

01:24:20.388 --> 01:24:22.357
IMAGINE ALL THE ISSUES THAT YOU

01:24:22.424 --> 01:24:23.925
EXPERIENCED WITH GENERATIVE AI

01:24:23.992 --> 01:24:25.527
AROUND HALLUCINATIONS, ALL OF

01:24:25.593 --> 01:24:30.098
THAT POTENTIALLY BEING IN PLACE

01:24:30.165 --> 01:24:31.533
WITHOUT WITHOUT ANY SAFEGUARDS

01:24:31.599 --> 01:24:34.469
OR OVERSIGHT. SB 833 WOULD GO A

01:24:34.536 --> 01:24:36.304
LONG WAY TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES

01:24:36.371 --> 01:24:39.073
AND IMPROVE THE SAFETY OF AI

01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:41.443

DON'T SEE HIM EITHER. I GUESS

01:26:13.835 --> 01:26:15.670
I'M A LITTLE PERPLEXED IF

01:26:15.737 --> 01:26:16.638
SOMEBODY FROM THE OPPOSITION

01:26:16.704 --> 01:26:18.306
WANTS TO. YEAH. ROBERT, COME

01:26:24.679 --> 01:26:26.114
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE SENATOR IS

01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:27.549
TRYING TO ACHIEVE HERE IS MAKING

01:26:27.615 --> 01:26:29.183
SURE THAT FOR CRITICAL

01:26:29.250 --> 01:26:30.818
INFRASTRUCTURE, WE RETAIN A

01:26:30.885 --> 01:26:33.655
HUMAN IN THE LOOP THAT CREATES

01:26:33.721 --> 01:26:35.890
POLICIES TO ENSURE THAT THESE

01:26:35.957 --> 01:26:36.524
FUNCTION THE WAY WE WANT. THIS

01:26:36.591 --> 01:26:39.093
IS OUR MOST CRITICAL PUBLIC

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:40.662
INFRASTRUCTURE. THE AMENDMENTS

01:26:40.728 --> 01:26:41.829
HE'S TAKEN IN THIS COMMITTEE.

01:26:41.896 --> 01:26:43.031
PERSONALLY, I HAVEN'T WORKED SO

01:26:43.097 --> 01:26:45.233
DEEPLY ON 911 AND 988 UNDERSTOOD

01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:48.036
THAT WE NEEDED TO GIVE MORE

01:26:48.102 --> 01:26:49.170
FLEXIBILITY TO AGENCIES. YOU

01:26:49.237 --> 01:26:50.271
CAN'T HAVE A HUMAN DECIDING

01:26:50.338 --> 01:26:52.307
EVERY TIME 911 USES AN ADS THAT

01:26:52.373 --> 01:26:54.175
WOULD MAKE 911 FALL APART,

01:26:54.242 --> 01:26:55.977
RIGHT? SO WE HAVE TO DEFER TO

01:26:56.044 --> 01:26:57.545
AGENCIES TO ALLOW THEM TO DECIDE

01:26:57.612 --> 01:27:00.214
HOW TO KEEP THE HUMAN IN THE

01:27:00.281 --> 01:27:00.882
LOOP. BUT I THINK FUNDAMENTALLY,

01:27:00.949 --> 01:27:02.450
THIS IS A REALLY SIMPLE BILL. I

01:27:02.517 --> 01:27:03.451
DON'T I ACTUALLY WAS SURPRISED

01:27:03.518 --> 01:27:05.320
THERE WAS OPPOSITION. CAN YOU

01:27:05.386 --> 01:27:07.088
GIVE US A LITTLE BIT MORE OF WHY

01:27:07.155 --> 01:27:08.590
YOU WOULD BE OPPOSED TO THIS?

01:27:08.656 --> 01:27:09.691
OH, IT'S JUST SOME CONCERNS

01:27:09.757 --> 01:27:11.492
WANTING TO NARROW THE SCOPE. WE

01:27:11.559 --> 01:27:12.961
THINK IT SHOULD BE APPLIED TO

01:27:13.027 --> 01:27:14.262
HIGH RISK SITUATIONS, MORE HIGH,

01:27:14.329 --> 01:27:15.430
MORE HIGH RISK SITUATIONS THAN

01:27:15.496 --> 01:27:17.298
THE DAY TO DAY ONES. IT'S JUST

01:27:17.365 --> 01:27:18.600
AN ONGOING CONVERSATION WE'RE

01:27:18.666 --> 01:27:20.435
HAVING. IS IT CRITICAL?

01:27:20.501 --> 01:27:21.135
INFRASTRUCTURE BY ITS NATURE,

01:27:21.202 --> 01:27:23.972
ALWAYS HIGH RISK. MAYBE WE CAN

01:27:24.038 --> 01:27:25.406
SAY THAT I'LL GO BACK AND FORTH

01:27:25.473 --> 01:27:29.477
WITH THAT. BUT THAT'S THE THAT'S

01:27:29.544 --> 01:27:31.980
I DON'T KNOW THAT FOR SURE. AND

01:27:32.046 --> 01:27:34.215
I WILL GO BACK AND TAKE THAT,

01:27:34.282 --> 01:27:37.218
BUT I DON'T I WAS ASKED, SORRY,

01:27:37.285 --> 01:27:39.320
CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD. WELL, IF

01:27:39.387 --> 01:27:41.022
YOU'RE GOING TO OPPOSE THE BILL,

01:27:41.089 --> 01:27:43.458
BE READY. SO OKAY. THANK YOU.

01:27:43.524 --> 01:27:44.559
OKAY. WELL, I JUST AM CONFUSED

01:27:44.626 --> 01:27:46.227
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE WHAT YOU'RE

01:27:46.294 --> 01:27:48.162
TRYING TO DO HERE IS MAKE SENSE

01:27:48.229 --> 01:27:49.964
TO ME. I WAS OBVIOUSLY I

01:27:50.031 --> 01:27:51.733
ACTUALLY THINK THAT THE MOST

01:27:51.799 --> 01:27:54.002
IMPORTANT PEOPLE TO BE TALKING

01:27:54.068 --> 01:27:55.937
TO IN THIS IS NOT, CONFUSINGLY,

01:27:56.004 --> 01:27:57.138
THE OPPOSITION THAT SHOWED UP

01:27:57.205 --> 01:27:58.272
TODAY. BUT THE AGENCIES LIKE,

01:27:58.339 --> 01:28:00.141
WILL THIS WORK FOR THEM, WHICH I

01:28:00.208 --> 01:28:01.142
THINK WAS REALLY THE

01:28:01.209 --> 01:28:02.477
CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAD IN

01:28:02.543 --> 01:28:03.611
PREPARATION FOR THIS, BECAUSE I

01:28:03.678 --> 01:28:07.248
THINK, YOU KNOW, TO ME, WHETHER

01:28:07.315 --> 01:28:09.050
OUR GRID STAYS UP IS OBVIOUSLY

01:28:09.117 --> 01:28:11.986
CRITICAL, FOR EXAMPLE. SO, YOU

01:28:12.053 --> 01:28:14.122
KNOW, I THINK YOU ARE FOCUSED ON

01:28:14.188 --> 01:28:16.658
THIS AND MAKING SURE IT WORKS

01:28:16.724 --> 01:28:17.291
FOR THE AGENCIES. BUT I IMAGINE

01:28:17.358 --> 01:28:18.559
AND I HOPE THAT THE GOVERNMENT,

01:28:18.626 --> 01:28:19.460
THAT THE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES

01:28:19.527 --> 01:28:21.896
WILL BE ON BOARD WITH THE IDEA

01:28:21.963 --> 01:28:23.197
THAT AS WE DEPLOY THESE ADS,

01:28:23.264 --> 01:28:24.832
THERE NEEDS TO BE SOMEONE THAT

01:28:24.899 --> 01:28:26.100
IS A HUMAN THAT'S OVERSEEING

01:28:26.167 --> 01:28:27.168
THEM. AND SO I ABSOLUTELY

01:28:27.235 --> 01:28:28.169
SUPPORT THIS EFFORT.

01:28:28.236 --> 01:28:29.537
ASSEMBLYMEMBER WILSON HAD SOME

01:28:29.604 --> 01:28:31.305
COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. I'VE BEEN

01:28:31.372 --> 01:28:32.940
RUNNING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN

01:28:33.007 --> 01:28:34.308
COMMITTEES. I WANTED TO BE

01:28:34.375 --> 01:28:37.712
CLEAR. IS THIS SB 833 OR SB

01:28:37.779 --> 01:28:41.816
SEVEN 833? OKAY, THEN I MISSED

01:28:41.883 --> 01:28:43.618
SEVEN. ALL RIGHT, NEVER MIND.

01:28:43.685 --> 01:28:50.458
I'M GOOD. AND SHE'S GONE. OKAY

01:28:50.525 --> 01:28:54.062
WITH THAT? I DON'T SEE ANY MORE

01:28:54.128 --> 01:28:55.163
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THANK

01:28:55.229 --> 01:28:58.499
YOU. SORRY MY MIC WAS OFF. THANK

01:28:58.566 --> 01:29:00.268
YOU, MR. BOYKIN, FOR COMING BACK

01:29:00.334 --> 01:29:03.237
AND INDULGING THE CHAIR. DO WE

01:29:03.304 --> 01:29:05.440
HAVE A MOTION ON THE BILL? WE

01:29:05.506 --> 01:29:10.411
HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND.

01:29:10.478 --> 01:29:12.380
PERFECT. LET'S CALL THE ROLL. SO

01:29:12.447 --> 01:29:14.115
I DON'T NEED TO CLOSE, I GUESS.

01:29:14.182 --> 01:29:15.950
OH, SORRY, I FORGOT THE CLOSE.

01:29:16.017 --> 01:29:17.218
SENATOR, WOULD YOU LIKE TO

01:29:17.285 --> 01:29:19.287
CLOSE? WELL, I, I THINK THE

01:29:19.353 --> 01:29:21.756
CHAIR. THIS IS A COMMON SENSE,

01:29:21.823 --> 01:29:22.957
BILL. WE'VE NARROWED IT DOWN

01:29:23.024 --> 01:29:24.759
REALLY QUITE A BIT. WE DON'T

01:29:24.826 --> 01:29:28.796
WANT TO CAUSE THE AGENCIES TO

01:29:28.863 --> 01:29:29.864
HAVE PROBLEMS. AND WE'VE GIVEN

01:29:29.931 --> 01:29:32.133
THEM QUITE A BIT OF FLEXIBILITY.

01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:33.668
AND, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A

01:29:33.735 --> 01:29:38.639
REPORT BY THE ON A TEST BY

01:29:38.706 --> 01:29:40.374
ANTHROPIC THAT SHOWED THAT AI

01:29:40.441 --> 01:29:44.011
SYSTEMS WOULD BE WILLING TO LIE,

01:29:44.078 --> 01:29:46.347
CHEAT, STEAL AND DO ANYTHING

01:29:46.414 --> 01:29:48.382
THEY CAN TO PROTECT THEMSELVES,

01:29:48.449 --> 01:29:50.184
INCLUDING HARMING HUMANS. SO

01:29:50.251 --> 01:29:51.486
IT'S NEEDED. THIS IS A FAIRLY

01:29:51.552 --> 01:29:53.020
NARROW AND THAT IT APPLIES

01:29:53.087 --> 01:29:55.323
REALLY TO STATE AGENCIES, BUT I

01:29:55.389 --> 01:29:56.691
THINK IT'S A STARTING POINT AND

01:29:56.758 --> 01:29:57.759
IT'S IMPORTANT. IT'S COMMON

01:29:57.825 --> 01:29:59.260
SENSE. SO WITH THAT I'LL ASK FOR

01:29:59.327 --> 01:30:02.263
AN AYE VOTE. AND I THANK THE

01:30:02.330 --> 01:30:03.297

ABOUT THE CLOSE THOUGHT. YOU DID

01:30:05.099 --> 01:30:07.168
SO WELL. WE DIDN'T EVEN NEED IT.

01:30:07.235 --> 01:30:09.470

ACCEPTING THIS COMMITTEE'S

02:45:21.778 --> 02:45:22.779

02:45:22.846 --> 02:45:24.648
FOR YOUR HELP AND ASSISTANCE.

02:45:24.714 --> 02:45:26.716
THE EYE ABUSE PROTECTION ACT

02:45:26.783 --> 02:45:29.653
ESTABLISHES A LEGAL FRAMEWORK

02:45:29.719 --> 02:45:31.087
FOR REGULATING ARTIFICIAL

02:45:31.154 --> 02:45:33.123
INTELLIGENCE, VOICE, IMAGE AND

02:45:33.189 --> 02:45:35.725
VIDEO CLONING TECHNOLOGY. THE

02:45:35.792 --> 02:45:37.427
RISE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

02:45:37.494 --> 02:45:39.963
PRESENTS A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY

02:45:40.030 --> 02:45:41.298
FOR INNOVATION, MOSTLY AS A

02:45:41.364 --> 02:45:42.999
REALLY GOOD THING. THIS

02:45:43.066 --> 02:45:44.801
INNOVATION CROSSES VARIOUS

02:45:44.868 --> 02:45:46.636
INDUSTRIES. THE TECHNOLOGIES ARE

02:45:46.703 --> 02:45:48.271
POWERFUL TOOL. WE KNOW THAT AND

02:45:48.338 --> 02:45:50.073
THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY WORKING

02:45:50.140 --> 02:45:51.574
TOWARDS THE CONTINUED

02:45:51.641 --> 02:45:53.677
ADVANCEMENT OF OUR GREAT STATE.

02:45:53.743 --> 02:45:56.646
HOWEVER, THERE IS A LACK OF

02:45:56.713 --> 02:45:59.115
COMPREHENSIVE LEGAL FRAMEWORK

02:45:59.182 --> 02:46:01.685
FOR ADDRESSING DEEPFAKES AND

02:46:01.751 --> 02:46:03.186
NONCONSENSUAL IMAGES AND VIDEOS

02:46:03.253 --> 02:46:05.255
THAT ARE DEEPLY TROUBLING. THIS

02:46:05.322 --> 02:46:07.757
LEAVES INDIVIDUALS VULNERABLE TO

02:46:07.824 --> 02:46:09.926
VARIOUS FORMS OF EXPLOITATION,

02:46:09.993 --> 02:46:12.729
IDENTITY THEFT, SCAMS,

02:46:12.796 --> 02:46:14.431
MISINFORMATION, AND

02:46:14.497 --> 02:46:16.399
MISREPRESENTATION OF CHARACTER.

02:46:16.466 --> 02:46:17.367
UNFORTUNATELY, THE TECHNOLOGY

02:46:17.434 --> 02:46:19.369
CAN SOMETIMES BE

02:46:19.436 --> 02:46:20.737
DISPROPORTIONATELY USED FOR

02:46:20.804 --> 02:46:23.940
THESE NEGATIVE USES, AND OFTEN

02:46:24.007 --> 02:46:26.476
THAT IS IMPACTING WOMEN AND

02:46:26.543 --> 02:46:28.645
GIRLS, THOUGH NOT EXCLUSIVELY,

02:46:28.712 --> 02:46:30.313
BUT THE CREATION OF SEXUALLY

02:46:30.380 --> 02:46:33.350
EXPLICIT PHOTOS AND VIDEOS HAS

02:46:33.416 --> 02:46:35.585
TAKEN OVER THE INTERNET. IT'S.

02:46:35.652 --> 02:46:37.420
THERE ARE MANY WELL-KNOWN CASES,

02:46:37.487 --> 02:46:39.155
LIKE THE TAYLOR SWIFT CASE,

02:46:39.222 --> 02:46:42.025
WHICH GAINED OVER 45 MILLION

02:46:42.092 --> 02:46:45.562

02:46:45.628 --> 02:46:48.565

CONTENT FEATURING ANYONE. SB 11

02:47:13.757 --> 02:47:15.825
ADDRESSES THE MISUSE OF

02:47:15.892 --> 02:47:17.260
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

02:47:17.327 --> 02:47:19.429
TECHNOLOGY BY ESTABLISHING

02:47:19.496 --> 02:47:21.564
GUARDRAILS. THESE GUARDRAILS

02:47:21.631 --> 02:47:24.467
PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM HARM BY

AI SOFTWARE. THREE ESTABLISHING

02:47:36.679 --> 02:47:39.082
VIOLATIONS FOR THE MISUSE OF AI

02:47:39.149 --> 02:47:40.784
TECHNOLOGY, AND FOUR PREVENTING

02:47:40.850 --> 02:47:44.521
AI GENERATED EVIDENCE TAMPERING

02:47:44.587 --> 02:47:46.723
IN OUR COURTROOMS. THIS BILL

02:47:46.790 --> 02:47:48.858
PROVIDES A BALANCED APPROACH OF

02:47:48.925 --> 02:47:50.660
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

02:47:50.727 --> 02:47:52.462

REMEDIES FOR VICTIMS OF ABUSE

02:47:54.631 --> 02:47:56.533
AND ALLOWING FOR THE INDUSTRY TO

CREATIVELY MOVE FORWARD IN OUR

02:47:58.268 --> 02:48:01.037

02:48:01.104 --> 02:48:02.872
REALLY WONDERFUL WITNESS WHO HAS

02:48:02.939 --> 02:48:05.442
A TON OF EXPERIENCE IN THIS

02:48:05.508 --> 02:48:07.243
SPACE, WHOSE NAME IS VERY

02:48:07.310 --> 02:48:08.278
DIFFICULT TO SAY. SO I'M GOING

02:48:08.344 --> 02:48:10.113
TO LET HIM INTRODUCE HIMSELF SO

02:48:10.180 --> 02:48:12.215
I DON'T MAKE A MISTAKE, BUT VERY

02:48:12.282 --> 02:48:14.484
HAPPY TO HAVE HIM WITH US TODAY.

02:48:14.551 --> 02:48:16.352
TELL HIM YOUR NAME AND TITLE.

02:48:16.419 --> 02:48:17.887
PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU.

02:48:17.954 --> 02:48:20.190
HONORABLE VICE CHAIR AND MEMBER,

02:48:20.256 --> 02:48:21.658
THANK YOU FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF

02:48:21.724 --> 02:48:23.726
PRESENTING HERE. MY NAME IS JAY

02:48:23.793 --> 02:48:25.562
JAYASIMHA AND I'M TESTIFYING IN

02:48:25.628 --> 02:48:27.697
SUPPORT OF SB 11. I'M THE

02:48:27.764 --> 02:48:29.098
CO-FOUNDER OF THE TRANSPARENCY

02:48:29.165 --> 02:48:30.533
COALITION. WE'RE AN INDEPENDENT

02:48:30.600 --> 02:48:32.435
NONPROFIT WHICH ADVOCATES FOR

02:48:32.502 --> 02:48:33.470
INCREASED TRANSPARENCY AND

02:48:33.536 --> 02:48:35.738
ACCOUNTABILITY IN GENERATIVE AI.

02:48:35.805 --> 02:48:37.507
SB 11 IS NOT ABOUT BROAD,

02:48:37.574 --> 02:48:38.808
SWEEPING REGULATION OF AI

02:48:38.875 --> 02:48:40.643
TECHNOLOGY ITSELF. WE HEARD

02:48:40.710 --> 02:48:41.778
ABOUT OTHER REGULATIONS THAT

02:48:41.845 --> 02:48:43.246
WERE GOING IN THAT SPACE IS A

02:48:43.313 --> 02:48:45.381
VERY SPECIFIC BILL THAT

02:48:45.448 --> 02:48:46.583
ESTABLISHES CLEAR DEFINITIONS

02:48:46.649 --> 02:48:49.018
AND RULES FOR HOW HIGH QUALITY

02:48:49.085 --> 02:48:50.220
DIGITAL VOICE AND IMAGE REPLICAS

02:48:50.286 --> 02:48:52.489
CAN BE CREATED BY AI. THERE'S

02:48:52.555 --> 02:48:54.057
CLEARLY EVIDENCE OF CONSUMER

02:48:54.123 --> 02:48:55.525
HARM, AS THE SENATOR SHARED, AND

02:48:55.592 --> 02:48:58.294
THE BILL DOES SEVERAL THINGS TO

02:48:58.361 --> 02:49:00.797
FIX THAT OR ADDRESS THAT ISSUE.

02:49:00.864 --> 02:49:02.465
HIGH QUALITY VOICE AND IMAGE

02:49:02.532 --> 02:49:03.766
REPLICA SHOULD BE TREATED AS THE

02:49:03.833 --> 02:49:05.034
ACTUAL VOICE AND LIKENESS OF THE

02:49:05.101 --> 02:49:06.069
SYSTEM. SO THAT'S THE FIRST

02:49:06.135 --> 02:49:08.104
THING. THE SECOND IS THAT IT

02:49:08.171 --> 02:49:09.606
EXPANDS THE RULES AROUND FALSE

02:49:09.672 --> 02:49:10.607
IMPERSONATION. TO INCLUDE THESE

02:49:10.673 --> 02:49:12.742
DIGITAL REPLICAS. IT REQUIRES A

02:49:12.809 --> 02:49:14.110
CONSUMER WARNING, AS THE SENATOR

02:49:14.177 --> 02:49:16.446
STATED, AGAINST THE MISUSE OF

02:49:16.513 --> 02:49:17.747
THESE TOOLS. AND FINALLY, IT

02:49:17.814 --> 02:49:19.482
ANALYZES THE IMPACT OF AI BASED

02:49:19.549 --> 02:49:21.484
ON THE RULES OF AI BASED CONTENT

02:49:21.551 --> 02:49:23.319
ON THE RULES OF EVIDENCE. THESE

02:49:23.386 --> 02:49:25.021
ARE VERY COMMON SENSE MEASURES,

02:49:25.088 --> 02:49:26.723
IN OUR OPINION, AND WILL PROMOTE

02:49:26.789 --> 02:49:28.525
GREATER SAFETY, TRANSPARENCY AND

02:49:28.591 --> 02:49:30.293
TRUST AROUND DIGITAL REPLICAS

02:49:30.360 --> 02:49:33.563
FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. CALIFORNIA

02:49:33.630 --> 02:49:35.098
MUST NOT BE DETERRED FROM ITS

02:49:35.164 --> 02:49:36.499
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT ITS

02:49:36.566 --> 02:49:37.901

EVOLVING LANDSCAPE OF CALIFORNIA

02:49:39.969 --> 02:49:40.904
LEADERSHIP IS MORE IMPORTANT

02:49:40.970 --> 02:49:43.706
THAN EVER. YOU KNOW, WHILE

02:49:43.773 --> 02:49:46.042
PEOPLE ARE TAKING STEPS TO DO

02:49:46.109 --> 02:49:47.443
MORE CAREFUL DEVELOPMENT OF

02:49:47.510 --> 02:49:49.412
MODELS, AND THEY NEED TO BE EVEN

02:49:49.479 --> 02:49:51.281
MORE CAREFUL AND HOPEFULLY THE

02:49:51.347 --> 02:49:52.849
PENALTIES AND THE ENFORCEMENT

02:49:52.916 --> 02:49:53.783
PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL WILL

02:49:53.850 --> 02:49:55.919
HELP THEM MAKE BETTER DECISIONS.

02:49:55.985 --> 02:49:57.687
SB 11 SENDS A CLEAR MESSAGE THAT

02:49:57.754 --> 02:49:59.389
THOUGHTFUL, SPECIFIC, TARGETED

02:49:59.455 --> 02:50:01.424

02:50:01.491 --> 02:50:02.492
INNOVATION, BUT IT'S ESSENTIAL

AT ALL. AT ALL. I'LL JUST TALK

02:50:46.636 --> 02:50:47.637
TO YOU, SENATOR. OH, GOSH.

02:50:47.704 --> 02:50:49.806
JESUS. SO I LEFT MY TESTIMONY IN

02:50:49.872 --> 02:50:51.107
THIS BUILDING SOMEWHERE. SO THIS

02:50:51.174 --> 02:50:52.909
IS OFF THE CUFF, SO BEAR WITH

02:50:52.976 --> 02:50:54.744
ME. OH MY GOD. REALLY? LIKE

02:50:54.811 --> 02:50:55.278
SITTING SOMEWHERE IN THIS

02:50:55.345 --> 02:50:56.379
BUILDING? YEP. IT'S DOWNSTAIRS

02:50:56.446 --> 02:50:58.448
SOMEWHERE. WHAT DID YOU SAY? I

02:50:58.514 --> 02:50:59.482
LEFT MY TESTIMONY THAT I PRINTED

02:50:59.549 --> 02:51:00.516
DOWNSTAIRS SOMEWHERE. SO WE'RE

02:51:00.583 --> 02:51:03.286
JUST GOING TO PLAY ALONG. MADAM

02:51:03.353 --> 02:51:04.687
VICE CHAIR, MEMBERS OF THE

02:51:04.754 --> 02:51:05.622
COMMITTEE, LARA BENNETT, ON

02:51:05.688 --> 02:51:07.190
BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER

02:51:07.256 --> 02:51:08.891
OF COMMERCE AND OPPOSE THE

02:51:08.958 --> 02:51:09.659
AMENDED POSITION. WE VERY MUCH

02:51:09.726 --> 02:51:11.628
APPRECIATE THE SENATOR'S RECENT

02:51:11.694 --> 02:51:12.996
AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL. IN FACT,

02:51:13.062 --> 02:51:14.764
WE APPRECIATE CRITICALLY THE

02:51:14.831 --> 02:51:16.933
CHANGE FROM MISUSE TO UNLAWFUL.

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.402
WE THINK THAT GOES A LONG WAY TO

02:51:19.469 --> 02:51:20.269
REMOVE SOME OF OUR CONCERNS.

02:51:20.336 --> 02:51:21.137
UNFORTUNATELY, WE DO HAVE SOME

02:51:21.204 --> 02:51:22.605
REMAINING CONCERNS, NAMELY AS IT

02:51:22.672 --> 02:51:24.140
RELATES TO THE PENALTY PROVISION

02:51:24.207 --> 02:51:26.209
IN THE BILL. RIGHT NOW, IT'S

02:51:26.275 --> 02:51:28.077
$25,000 PER DAY FOR NOT

02:51:28.144 --> 02:51:30.213
PROVIDING A CONSUMER WARNING. WE

02:51:30.279 --> 02:51:31.447
WOULD APPRECIATE THAT BEING

02:51:31.514 --> 02:51:33.349
LOWERED A BIT TO ABOUT $5,000,

02:51:33.416 --> 02:51:35.451
WHICH WE THINK IS IN LINE WITH

02:51:35.518 --> 02:51:36.886
OTHER CONSUMER WARNINGS SUCH AS

02:51:36.953 --> 02:51:38.688
PROP 65, WHICH GIVES A PERSON A

02:51:38.755 --> 02:51:39.689
WARNING ABOUT THE CHEMICALS THAT

02:51:39.756 --> 02:51:41.557
COULD CAUSE BIRTH DEFECTS. IT'S

02:51:41.624 --> 02:51:43.192
NOT ABOUT THE CHEMICALS CAUSING,

02:51:43.259 --> 02:51:44.594
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE WARNING

02:51:44.661 --> 02:51:45.828
CAUSING THE BIRTH DEFECT. IT'S

02:51:45.895 --> 02:51:47.063
THE WARNING IS TELLING SOMEONE

02:51:47.130 --> 02:51:48.765
ABOUT THE CONDUCT OF THE

02:51:48.831 --> 02:51:49.432
CHEMICALS. WE THINK THAT'S MORE

02:51:49.499 --> 02:51:51.300
IN LINE IN THIS BILL. WE'RE

02:51:51.367 --> 02:51:52.802
TELLING USERS OF THE TECHNOLOGY

02:51:52.869 --> 02:51:55.872
THAT THEY COULD COULD BE LAWFUL

02:51:55.938 --> 02:51:57.674
FOR CRIMINAL CIVIL LIABILITY. IN

02:51:57.740 --> 02:51:59.542
ADDITION, THE NEW WORDING OF THE

02:51:59.609 --> 02:52:02.979
LANGUAGE IN THE BILL TODAY SAYS

02:52:03.046 --> 02:52:04.847
UNLAWFUL USE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY

02:52:04.914 --> 02:52:06.315
TO DEPICT ANOTHER PERSON WITHOUT

02:52:06.382 --> 02:52:07.383
PRIOR CONSENT MAY RESULT IN

02:52:07.450 --> 02:52:09.118
CIVIL OR CRIMINAL LIABILITY FOR

02:52:09.185 --> 02:52:10.486
THE USER. WE DO APPRECIATE THE

02:52:10.553 --> 02:52:11.487
ADDITION OF CONSENT. WE THINK

02:52:11.554 --> 02:52:13.289
THAT THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS. WHAT

02:52:13.356 --> 02:52:14.223
WE'RE TELLING PEOPLE IS

02:52:14.290 --> 02:52:15.291
UNLAWFUL. UNFORTUNATELY, WE

02:52:15.358 --> 02:52:17.093
THINK IT SHOULD SAY CREATE A

02:52:17.160 --> 02:52:19.929
DIGITAL REPLICA WITHOUT CONSENT.

02:52:19.996 --> 02:52:21.230
WE THINK THAT IS IN LINE WITH

02:52:21.297 --> 02:52:23.433
THE ACTUAL PROHIBITION. AND IN

02:52:23.499 --> 02:52:25.334
SECTION Ã WE DO. WE HAVE ASKED

02:52:25.401 --> 02:52:26.803
PREVIOUSLY TO DO MORE AMENDMENTS

02:52:26.869 --> 02:52:29.105
RELATED TO SPECIFICALLY MARKETED

AND DESIGNED TO CREATE A DIGITAL

02:52:31.140 --> 02:52:32.175
REPLICA. WE UNDERSTAND THE

02:52:32.241 --> 02:52:34.077
SENATOR HAS NOT IS NOT INCLINED

02:52:34.143 --> 02:52:35.878
TO ACCEPT THAT AMENDMENT TODAY.

02:52:35.945 --> 02:52:37.280
IN ADDITION TO THAT, WE HAVE

02:52:37.346 --> 02:52:38.681
ASKED TO ADDRESS THE B2B AND

02:52:38.748 --> 02:52:40.750
EMPLOYEE USE. AGAIN. WE THINK

02:52:40.817 --> 02:52:42.919
THE CONSENT PROVISION. ALSO,

02:52:42.985 --> 02:52:45.621
ADDITIONS MAY ADDRESS THAT

02:52:45.688 --> 02:52:46.589
CONCERN, BUT WE ARE REVIEWING

02:52:46.656 --> 02:52:48.124
THOSE AMENDMENTS. JUST WANTED TO

02:52:48.191 --> 02:52:49.892
PRINT I THINK ON SATURDAY. SO

02:52:49.959 --> 02:52:52.628
WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT THOSE.

COMMITTEE FOR THEIR DILIGENCE ON

02:53:00.036 --> 02:53:01.204

02:53:01.270 --> 02:53:03.573
UNLESS AMENDED LETTER CROSSED

02:53:03.639 --> 02:53:05.675
THE AMENDMENTS IN SPACE IN REAL

02:53:05.742 --> 02:53:07.410
TIME. SO WE DO THINK THE

02:53:07.477 --> 02:53:08.511
AMENDMENTS OUR LETTER WAS

02:53:08.578 --> 02:53:09.946
LARGELY FOCUSED ON THE BUSINESS

BUSINESS TO BUSINESS USES THERE.

02:53:15.384 --> 02:53:17.220
THE MOVE TO CONSUMERS, I THINK,

02:53:17.286 --> 02:53:18.654
GOES A LONG WAY IN FIXING THE

02:53:18.721 --> 02:53:20.356
BILL. WE DO. WE MAY WE'RE STILL

02:53:20.423 --> 02:53:21.924
ANALYZING THE AMENDMENTS. WE MAY

02:53:21.991 --> 02:53:23.326
SHARE SOME OF THE SAME CONCERNS

02:53:23.392 --> 02:53:25.862
ABOUT THE WORDING ON THE

02:53:25.928 --> 02:53:26.996
WARNING, AND THEN ALSO THE

02:53:27.063 --> 02:53:28.131
PLACEMENT OF THE WARNING AND HOW

02:53:28.197 --> 02:53:30.199
THAT MIGHT EXIST IN A REAL TIME

02:53:30.266 --> 02:53:32.068
VIDEO GAME SETTING. BUT THE

02:53:32.135 --> 02:53:32.969
AMENDMENTS DO SEEM TO GO IN THE

02:53:33.035 --> 02:53:34.871
RIGHT DIRECTION. WE APPRECIATE

02:53:34.937 --> 02:53:35.471

FASCINATING TO ME AND IT'S SO

02:54:37.800 --> 02:54:40.036
IMPRESSIVE WHAT IT CAN DO. BUT I

02:54:40.102 --> 02:54:40.703
WILL TELL YOU, SCROLLING THROUGH

02:54:40.770 --> 02:54:42.271
SOCIAL MEDIA, I HAVE TO DOUBLE

02:54:42.338 --> 02:54:43.673
TAKE SOMETIMES WHEN YOU SEE

02:54:43.739 --> 02:54:45.041
VIDEOS AND YOU'RE LIKE, OKAY, IS

02:54:45.107 --> 02:54:46.108
SOMEBODY SAYING SOMETHING CRAZY

02:54:46.175 --> 02:54:47.343
OR IS THIS REALLY HAPPENING IN

02:54:47.410 --> 02:54:48.377
TODAY'S WORLD? IT'S VERY

02:54:48.444 --> 02:54:49.946
REALISTIC IN EITHER DIRECTION.

02:54:50.012 --> 02:54:51.180
AND NOW, YOU KNOW, BEING A

02:54:51.247 --> 02:54:52.982
PUBLIC FIGURE, WHICH SOUNDS, I

02:54:53.049 --> 02:54:54.417
GUESS, KIND OF ARROGANT, BUT I

02:54:54.483 --> 02:54:56.085
AM. IT SCARES ME OF WHAT

02:54:56.152 --> 02:54:58.020
SOMEBODY CAN DO TO USE AI, TO

02:54:58.087 --> 02:54:59.555
USE MY IMAGE AND LIKENESS AND

02:54:59.622 --> 02:55:02.024
THINGS LIKE THAT. MY ONLY

02:55:02.091 --> 02:55:02.959
CONCERN IS TO WHAT YOU

02:55:03.025 --> 02:55:04.727
MENTIONED. OF THE $25,000 FIGURE

02:55:04.794 --> 02:55:06.262
THAT I DO THINK THAT'S EXTREMELY

02:55:06.329 --> 02:55:09.232
HIGH, BUT I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW

02:55:09.298 --> 02:55:10.566
YOU, AND I KNOW THAT YOU WORK

02:55:10.633 --> 02:55:12.301
REALLY WELL TO FIND COMMON SENSE

02:55:12.368 --> 02:55:13.169
SOLUTIONS. SO I WILL BE

02:55:13.236 --> 02:55:14.971
SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. BUT

02:55:15.037 --> 02:55:16.906
THAT IS MY ONLY CONCERN IS THAT

02:55:16.973 --> 02:55:18.174
NUMBER. SO I ASK THAT YOU WORK

02:55:18.241 --> 02:55:19.909
WITH OPPOSITION ON THAT. BUT

02:55:19.976 --> 02:55:21.344
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS VERY

02:55:21.410 --> 02:55:22.511
IMPORTANT BILL FORWARD AND LET'S

02:55:22.578 --> 02:55:23.145
PROTECT OUR IMAGE AND LIKENESS.

02:55:23.212 --> 02:55:25.481
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SENATOR.

02:55:25.548 --> 02:55:27.149

COMMITTEE? MISS PELLERIN, DO YOU

02:55:30.052 --> 02:55:34.357

02:55:34.423 --> 02:55:36.058
GIVE YOU THE GAME. AS WE ALL

02:55:36.125 --> 02:55:39.795
KNOW, YOU HAVE NO COMMENTS. NO,

02:55:39.862 --> 02:55:41.297
I WAS GOING TO SAY THE SAME AS

02:55:41.364 --> 02:55:43.299
MY COLLEAGUE. THE FINE TO ME

02:55:43.366 --> 02:55:45.501
SEEMS A LITTLE STIFF. SO I HOPE

02:55:45.568 --> 02:55:46.969
THERE WILL BE FURTHER AMENDMENTS

02:55:47.036 --> 02:55:48.104
SO WE CAN BRING EVERYBODY

02:55:48.170 --> 02:55:50.907
TOGETHER ON THIS. I APPRECIATE

02:55:50.973 --> 02:55:52.742
THAT IT'S SUCH THE END OF THE

02:55:52.808 --> 02:55:54.110
WEEK. WE'RE ALL SO TIRED. IT'S

02:55:54.176 --> 02:55:57.446
SO BAD. IT'S SO BAD. SO I'VE

02:55:57.513 --> 02:55:59.348
BEEN INFORMED THAT WE CAN TAKE A

02:55:59.415 --> 02:56:02.351
VOTE. IT'S OBVIOUSLY WE NEED A

02:56:02.418 --> 02:56:04.253
MOTION A SECOND. WE DON'T HAVE A

02:56:04.320 --> 02:56:05.755
QUORUM, BUT IT WILL STILL BE

02:56:05.821 --> 02:56:08.491
RECORDED AS A VOTE. NO, NO. WHAT

02:56:08.557 --> 02:56:12.161
DO WE SAY? BEAR WITH US. WE'VE

02:56:12.228 --> 02:56:13.663

SUPER RESPECTFUL. THEY ACTUALLY

02:57:04.146 --> 02:57:05.247

02:57:07.583 --> 02:57:08.985
THAT HAVE HAPPENED. SO GIVE THEM

02:57:09.051 --> 02:57:11.287
A CHANCE TO DO THAT. WE'RE OPEN,

02:57:11.354 --> 02:57:11.921
WE'RE OPEN. WE'LL KEEP TALKING

02:57:11.988 --> 02:57:13.289

MAKE THEIR WAY FORWARD. THIS IS

02:57:54.930 --> 02:57:57.333
THE SAFER STREETS ACT, WHICH I

02:57:57.400 --> 02:57:59.835
AM VERY HONORED TO PRESENT TO

02:57:59.902 --> 02:58:02.338
YOU TODAY. THANK THE COMMITTEE

02:58:02.405 --> 02:58:04.206
CHAIR AND STAFF FOR THEIR

02:58:04.273 --> 02:58:06.242
ASSISTANCE ON THIS BILL. VERY

02:58:06.308 --> 02:58:09.245
HELPFUL. SB 720 ALLOWS CITIES TO

02:58:09.311 --> 02:58:11.947
OPT INTO A NEW RED LIGHT CAMERA

02:58:12.014 --> 02:58:14.183
SYSTEM FOR HIGH COLLISION ZONES,

02:58:14.250 --> 02:58:16.752
PROVIDING A VITAL TOOL TO REDUCE

02:58:16.819 --> 02:58:20.956
TRAFFIC FATALITIES IN 2021, OVER

02:58:21.023 --> 02:58:22.391
4000 CALIFORNIANS LOST THEIR

02:58:22.458 --> 02:58:24.393
LIVES TO TRAFFIC COLLISIONS,

02:58:24.460 --> 02:58:25.661
WITH MORE THAN A QUARTER OF

02:58:25.728 --> 02:58:27.096
THOSE DEATHS RESULTING FROM

02:58:27.163 --> 02:58:30.032
DRIVERS WHO RAN RED LIGHTS. THE

02:58:30.099 --> 02:58:31.600
OUTDATED AND EXPENSIVE STRUCTURE

02:58:31.667 --> 02:58:33.536
OF OUR CURRENT RED LIGHT CAMERA

02:58:33.602 --> 02:58:35.271
PROGRAMS HAVE PROVEN THEMSELVES

02:58:35.337 --> 02:58:37.573
TO BE INCREDIBLY INEFFECTIVE,

02:58:37.640 --> 02:58:40.443
OVERLY PUNITIVE, AND OVERLY

02:58:40.509 --> 02:58:42.178
TARGETED AT FACTORS THAT HAVE

02:58:42.244 --> 02:58:43.779
NOTHING TO DO WITH TRAFFIC

02:58:43.846 --> 02:58:45.481
SAFETY. THE DISDAIN FOR OUR

02:58:45.548 --> 02:58:47.249
CURRENT RED LIGHT PROGRAM IS, I

02:58:47.316 --> 02:58:48.918
BELIEVE, THE THING THAT UNIFIES

02:58:48.984 --> 02:58:51.620
US ALL IN THE LEGISLATURE.

02:58:51.687 --> 02:58:54.156
CURRENTLY, UNLIKE OTHER STATES,

02:58:54.223 --> 02:58:55.524
CALIFORNIA HOLDS DRIVERS

02:58:55.591 --> 02:58:57.726
RESPONSIBLE FOR VIOLATIONS BY

02:58:57.793 --> 02:58:59.128
REQUIRING A PHOTO OF THE

02:58:59.195 --> 02:59:00.629
PERSON'S FACE AS THEY RUN

02:59:00.696 --> 02:59:02.898
THROUGH THE RED LIGHT. DRIVER

02:59:02.965 --> 02:59:04.900
CANNOT BE IDENTIFIED. THEN THE

02:59:04.967 --> 02:59:07.169
VIOLATION NOTICE IS SENT TO THE

02:59:07.236 --> 02:59:08.237
VEHICLE'S REGISTERED OWNER, AND

02:59:08.304 --> 02:59:10.639
THEN, OF COURSE, THE FINGER

02:59:10.706 --> 02:59:12.875
POINTING BEGINS. AS WE ALL KNOW,

02:59:12.942 --> 02:59:14.743
THIS CONTROVERSIAL FACIAL

02:59:14.810 --> 02:59:15.678
RECOGNITION IS REALLY OUTDATED

02:59:15.744 --> 02:59:17.913
AND UNNECESSARY. AND CALIFORNIA,

02:59:17.980 --> 02:59:19.548
THE HOME OF INNOVATION, NEEDS TO

02:59:19.615 --> 02:59:21.884
GET ON BOARD WITH A BETTER

02:59:21.951 --> 02:59:25.788
SYSTEM. RIGHT NOW IF IDENTIFIED,

02:59:25.855 --> 02:59:27.923
WHICH IS QUITE THE QUALIFIER.

02:59:27.990 --> 02:59:29.325
VIOLATORS ARE SUBJECT TO A

02:59:29.391 --> 02:59:30.693
CRIMINAL PENALTY, WHICH INCLUDES

02:59:30.759 --> 02:59:33.028
A FINE UPWARDS OF $500 POINTS ON

02:59:33.095 --> 02:59:34.463
THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSE, AND THE

02:59:34.530 --> 02:59:36.932
VERY POPULAR TRAFFIC COURT. AS

02:59:36.999 --> 02:59:39.468
WE KNOW, INSURANCE RATES ARE

02:59:39.535 --> 02:59:41.337
ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY RED

02:59:41.403 --> 02:59:43.372
LIGHT VIOLATIONS. THOSE HIGH

02:59:43.439 --> 02:59:45.174
FEES AND PENALTIES ASSOCIATED

02:59:45.241 --> 02:59:46.642
WITH THE CURRENT OUTDATED RED

02:59:46.709 --> 02:59:48.811
LIGHT TRAFFIC ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM

02:59:48.878 --> 02:59:50.646
CREATE A PRETTY BIG FINANCIAL

02:59:50.713 --> 02:59:53.449
BURDEN AND LONG TERM EFFECT ON

02:59:53.516 --> 02:59:56.752
FAMILIES DEALING WITH POVERTY.

02:59:56.819 --> 02:59:59.221
SB 720 PROVIDES AN UPDATED

02:59:59.288 --> 03:00:00.823
FRAMEWORK SO THAT CALIFORNIA CAN

03:00:00.890 --> 03:00:02.391
JOIN THE REST OF THE WORLD IN

03:00:02.458 --> 03:00:05.794
THE YEAR 2025. IT SHIFTS THE

03:00:05.861 --> 03:00:07.730
PROGRAM FROM DRIVER LIABILITY TO

03:00:07.796 --> 03:00:09.698
OWNER LIABILITY, REMOVING ANY

03:00:09.765 --> 03:00:11.934
NEED FOR FACIAL ID PROGRAMS.

03:00:12.001 --> 03:00:13.335
THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU DRIVE

03:00:13.402 --> 03:00:14.436
ACROSS THE TOLL BRIDGES AND THE

03:00:14.503 --> 03:00:16.105
CAMERA TAKES A PHOTO OF YOUR

03:00:16.172 --> 03:00:17.506
LICENSE PLATE. IT DOESN'T CARE

03:00:17.573 --> 03:00:19.508
WHO THE DRIVER IS. IT ONLY CARES

03:00:19.575 --> 03:00:20.943
THAT YOU HAVE CROSSED THE

03:00:21.010 --> 03:00:24.246
BRIDGE. CHANGES TO THE VIOLATION.

03:00:24.313 --> 03:00:26.115
IN TERMS OF CRIMINAL PENALTY TO

03:00:26.182 --> 03:00:28.017
A CIVIL PENALTY, THERE'S NO

03:00:28.083 --> 03:00:29.885
REASON FOR RED LIGHT VIOLATION

03:00:29.952 --> 03:00:31.353
TO BE CRIMINAL AND THEREBY HAVE

03:00:31.420 --> 03:00:33.055
ALL OF THE COMPONENTS TO A

03:00:33.122 --> 03:00:35.291
CRIMINAL VIOLATION. CIVIL

03:00:35.357 --> 03:00:38.093
PENALTY SUFFICES. THIS EASES

03:00:38.160 --> 03:00:39.995
INSURANCE BURDENS BECAUSE IT NO

03:00:40.062 --> 03:00:42.064
LONGER DEALS WITH POINTS ON YOUR

03:00:42.131 --> 03:00:44.600
DRIVER'S RECORD, NOR YOUR

03:00:44.667 --> 03:00:46.769
INSURANCE. IT IMPLEMENTS A

03:00:46.835 --> 03:00:48.938
TIERED VIOLATION SYSTEM FOR

03:00:49.004 --> 03:00:50.706
VIOLATIONS AND DIRECTS FUNDING

03:00:50.773 --> 03:00:53.309
BACK TOWARDS SAFE, MULTI-MODAL

03:00:53.375 --> 03:00:56.245
TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS IN YOUR

03:00:56.312 --> 03:00:57.980
COMMUNITIES. THOSE OF US WHO

03:00:58.047 --> 03:00:59.381
HAVE SERVED ON THE LOCAL LEVEL,

03:00:59.448 --> 03:01:01.383
WE KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO FIND

03:01:01.450 --> 03:01:02.751
THOSE RARE AND PRECIOUS DOLLARS

03:01:02.818 --> 03:01:04.553
FOR BIKE LANES AND OVER

03:01:04.620 --> 03:01:06.255
CROSSINGS AND PEDESTRIAN

03:01:06.322 --> 03:01:08.290
WALKWAYS. THIS IS A REAL AND

03:01:08.357 --> 03:01:10.259
TRUE FUNDING SOURCE FOR ALL OF

03:01:10.326 --> 03:01:11.327
THOSE INCREDIBLE PROGRAMS THAT

03:01:11.393 --> 03:01:14.096
DO A LOT MORE FOR TRAFFIC SAFETY

03:01:14.163 --> 03:01:15.631
THAN AN OUTDATED RED LIGHT

03:01:15.698 --> 03:01:18.067
CAMERA SYSTEM. LOCAL GOVERNMENT

03:01:18.133 --> 03:01:19.868
MAY CHOOSE TO OPT INTO THIS

03:01:19.935 --> 03:01:22.104
PROGRAM. IT'S NOT MANDATORY, BUT

03:01:22.171 --> 03:01:23.472
HERE'S WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO. IN

03:01:23.539 --> 03:01:25.874
ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE, THEY HAVE

03:01:25.941 --> 03:01:26.508
TO DEVELOP GUIDELINES FOR

03:01:26.575 --> 03:01:28.244
SCREENING AND ISSUING THE

03:01:28.310 --> 03:01:29.645
VIOLATIONS. THEY HAVE TO DEVELOP

03:01:29.712 --> 03:01:31.413
GUIDELINES FOR SELECTING THE

03:01:31.480 --> 03:01:33.315
LOCATION TO INSTALL THESE

03:01:33.382 --> 03:01:34.617
SYSTEMS. AND THOSE LOCATIONS

03:01:34.683 --> 03:01:37.152
HAVE TO BE BASED ON COLLISION

03:01:37.219 --> 03:01:39.388
ANALYSIS WHERE THE ACCIDENTS ARE

03:01:39.455 --> 03:01:41.590
ACTUALLY HAPPENING, NOT WHERE WE

03:01:41.657 --> 03:01:43.225
WANT TO POLICE COMMUNITIES, BUT

03:01:43.292 --> 03:01:44.727
RATHER WHERE ACCIDENTS ARE

03:01:44.793 --> 03:01:46.295
ACTUALLY HAPPENING. AND THEY

03:01:46.362 --> 03:01:49.064
MUST SUBMIT AN ANNUAL REPORT ON

03:01:49.131 --> 03:01:51.233
THE DATA FROM THE AUTOMATED

03:01:51.300 --> 03:01:53.035
TRACKING TRAFFIC ENFORCEMENT

03:01:53.102 --> 03:01:56.372
SYSTEM. SB 720 ENSURES THAT

03:01:56.438 --> 03:01:57.706
CITIES HAVE TOOLS NEEDED TO

03:01:57.773 --> 03:01:59.174
CREATE SAFER STREETS, MAKING

03:01:59.241 --> 03:02:00.976
THIS A CRITICAL STEP TOWARDS

03:02:01.043 --> 03:02:02.778
REDUCING TRAFFIC COLLISIONS IN

03:02:02.845 --> 03:02:05.281
CALIFORNIA AND ENSURING THAT OUR

03:02:05.347 --> 03:02:06.749
COMMUNITIES ARE SAFER. YOU WILL

03:02:06.815 --> 03:02:08.217
HEAR FROM SOME OF THE WITNESSES

03:02:08.284 --> 03:02:10.019
TODAY HOW THIS SYSTEM HAS

03:02:10.085 --> 03:02:11.720
REDUCED RED LIGHT RUNNING AND

03:02:11.787 --> 03:02:13.956
REDUCED COLLISIONS IN OTHER

03:02:14.023 --> 03:02:16.158
PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. THE BILL

03:02:16.225 --> 03:02:18.193
IN ITS IMPLEMENTATION

03:02:18.260 --> 03:02:19.428
IMPLEMENTATION SHOULD DO THE

03:02:19.495 --> 03:02:20.329
FOLLOWING. IT SHOULD MAKE US

03:02:20.396 --> 03:02:22.531
SAFER. IT SHOULD DECRIMINALIZE

03:02:22.598 --> 03:02:24.366
TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS. IT SHOULD

03:02:24.433 --> 03:02:26.535
REDUCE FINES, FEES AND INSURANCE

03:02:26.602 --> 03:02:27.870
BURDENS. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,

03:02:27.936 --> 03:02:30.139
IT SHOULD SAVE THE LIVES OF OUR

03:02:30.205 --> 03:02:31.307
CONSTITUENTS WHO ARE DRIVING

03:02:31.373 --> 03:02:33.375
AROUND THE GOLDEN STATE. WITH ME

03:02:33.442 --> 03:02:35.544
TODAY IS DAMIAN KEVITT FROM

03:02:35.611 --> 03:02:37.246
STREETS ARE FOR EVERYONE AND DEB

03:02:37.313 --> 03:02:39.048
BANKS FROM SACRAMENTO. AREA BIKE

03:02:39.114 --> 03:02:41.016
ADVOCATES RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR

03:02:41.083 --> 03:02:44.553
YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. PLEASE

03:02:44.620 --> 03:02:46.388
PROCEED. WHICHEVER. WHOEVER'S

03:02:46.455 --> 03:02:47.489
FIRST. ALL RIGHT, I'LL GO FIRST.

03:02:47.556 --> 03:02:49.158
GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYBODY. MY

03:02:49.224 --> 03:02:50.559
NAME IS DEBORAH BANKS. I'M THE

03:02:50.626 --> 03:02:52.428
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF SACRAMENTO

03:02:52.494 --> 03:02:54.229
AREA BICYCLE ADVOCATES, ALSO

03:02:54.296 --> 03:02:56.498
KNOWN AS SABA. WE ARE A

03:02:56.565 --> 03:02:59.001
CO-SPONSOR OF SB 720. I'VE BEEN

03:02:59.068 --> 03:03:00.602
IN MY POSITION FOR SIX YEARS,

03:03:00.669 --> 03:03:03.806
AND I CAME TO IT AS A VICTIM OF

03:03:03.872 --> 03:03:04.473
VEHICULAR VIOLENCE. WHILE RIDING

03:03:04.540 --> 03:03:06.675
MY BIKE, A DRUNK DRIVER HIT ME

03:03:06.742 --> 03:03:09.445
FROM BEHIND AT 45 PLUS MILES PER

03:03:09.511 --> 03:03:11.280
HOUR. I'M REALLY LUCKY TO BE

03:03:11.347 --> 03:03:13.048
HERE WITH YOU ALL. AND HERE WE

03:03:13.115 --> 03:03:15.784
ARE. SABA ADVOCATES FOR SAFE

03:03:15.851 --> 03:03:17.286
STREETS FOR ALL USERS. WE

03:03:17.353 --> 03:03:19.188
BELIEVE THAT IF THEY'RE SAFE FOR

03:03:19.254 --> 03:03:20.456
PEDESTRIANS AND CYCLISTS, THEN

03:03:20.522 --> 03:03:22.624
THEY'RE SAFER FOR DRIVERS TOO.

03:03:22.691 --> 03:03:24.426
BUT WE HAVE WORK TO DO.

03:03:24.493 --> 03:03:26.995
SACRAMENTO IS ONE OF THE MOST

03:03:27.062 --> 03:03:27.696
DANGEROUS CITIES FOR ROAD SAFETY

03:03:27.763 --> 03:03:29.565
IN CALIFORNIA, AND RANKS PRETTY

03:03:29.631 --> 03:03:32.067
HIGH ACROSS THE NATION. RED

03:03:32.134 --> 03:03:33.802
LIGHT RUNNING IS A ROAD SAFETY

03:03:33.869 --> 03:03:35.704
ISSUE FOR DRIVERS, PEDESTRIANS,

03:03:35.771 --> 03:03:37.706
CYCLISTS, AND IN PARTICULAR

03:03:37.773 --> 03:03:40.008
CHILDREN. ACROSS THE US. FATAL

03:03:40.075 --> 03:03:41.410
CRASHES CAUSED BY DRIVERS

03:03:41.477 --> 03:03:42.678
RUNNING RED LIGHTS HAVE REACHED

03:03:42.745 --> 03:03:45.781
A TEN YEAR HIGH. SACRAMENTO USED

03:03:45.848 --> 03:03:47.249
TO HAVE A RED LIGHT PROGRAM. IT

03:03:47.316 --> 03:03:50.085
WAS MANAGED BY SAC COUNTY. DATA

03:03:50.152 --> 03:03:51.453
COLLECTED BY THE CITY REPORTS

03:03:51.520 --> 03:03:56.158
THAT BETWEEN 2020 AND 2023, 4300

03:03:56.225 --> 03:03:57.893
CRASHES WERE DUE TO A BROADSIDE

03:03:57.960 --> 03:04:01.630
OR THAT T-BONED TYPE OF A CRASH.

03:04:01.697 --> 03:04:03.332
24% OF THOSE WERE FATAL OR

03:04:03.399 --> 03:04:05.300
CAUSED INJURY, SERIOUS INJURY,

03:04:05.367 --> 03:04:08.003
AND 23% OF THOSE BROADSIDE

03:04:08.070 --> 03:04:11.607
CRASHES INCLUDED A CYCLIST. IN

03:04:11.673 --> 03:04:14.643
2023, THERE WERE 1300 BROADSIDE

03:04:14.710 --> 03:04:16.278
CRASHES ALONE, AND SACRAMENTO

03:04:16.345 --> 03:04:18.180
COUNTY DROPPED OUR RED LIGHT

03:04:18.247 --> 03:04:22.084
CAMERA PROGRAM IN EARLY 2024.

03:04:22.151 --> 03:04:23.886
DATA HIGHLIGHTS THE DANGER OF

03:04:23.952 --> 03:04:25.354
INTERSECTIONS. AS SENATOR ASHBY

03:04:25.421 --> 03:04:27.489
JUST SAID, 4000 ANNUAL

03:04:27.556 --> 03:04:29.992
COLLISIONS NATIONWIDE IN

03:04:30.058 --> 03:04:31.393
SACRAMENTO. MORE THAN HALF OF

03:04:31.460 --> 03:04:34.029
THOSE ANNUAL COLLISIONS ARE AT

03:04:34.096 --> 03:04:35.898
TRAFFIC SIGNALS, ACCORDING TO

03:04:35.964 --> 03:04:38.667
TRIPLE A, THREE PEOPLE DIE IN

03:04:38.734 --> 03:04:40.803
RED LIGHT RUNNING CRASHES

03:04:40.869 --> 03:04:42.371
NATIONWIDE. YESTERDAY, I

03:04:42.438 --> 03:04:43.972
WITNESSED THREE DRIVERS RUN A

03:04:44.039 --> 03:04:45.841
RED LIGHT IN THE FIVE MILES THAT

03:04:45.908 --> 03:04:48.277
I COMMUTE ON MY WAY HOME FROM MY

03:04:48.343 --> 03:04:49.845
OFFICE. THEY'RE NOT JUST

03:04:49.912 --> 03:04:51.380
STATISTICS. THEY'RE PREVENTABLE

03:04:51.447 --> 03:04:53.115
TRAGEDIES THAT DEMAND IMMEDIATE

03:04:53.182 --> 03:04:54.917
ACTION TO FIX OUR OUTDATED

03:04:54.983 --> 03:04:57.753
TRAFFIC SAFETY SYSTEMS. EVERY

03:04:57.820 --> 03:04:59.021
COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA DESERVES

03:04:59.087 --> 03:05:00.989
ACCESS TO PROVEN SAFETY TOOLS

03:05:01.056 --> 03:05:02.758
THAT PROTECT PEDESTRIANS,

03:05:02.825 --> 03:05:05.661
CYCLISTS AND DRIVERS ALIKE. BY

03:05:05.727 --> 03:05:06.662
MODERNIZING OUR APPROACH TO RED

03:05:06.728 --> 03:05:08.430
LIGHT CAMERA PROGRAMS, WE CAN

03:05:08.497 --> 03:05:10.365
MAKE THEM SUSTAINABLE AND MORE

03:05:10.432 --> 03:05:12.134
EFFECTIVE AT PREVENTING FUTURE

03:05:12.201 --> 03:05:13.936
TRAGEDIES ON OUR ROAD. WE ASK

03:05:14.002 --> 03:05:17.306
FOR YOUR VOTE OF SB 720. THANK

03:05:17.372 --> 03:05:20.409
YOU. NEXT SPEAKER PLEASE. THANK

03:05:20.476 --> 03:05:22.177
YOU, MADAM VICE CHAIR. GOOD TO

03:05:22.244 --> 03:05:24.446
SEE YOU AGAIN. MEMBERS. MY NAME

03:05:24.513 --> 03:05:26.081
IS DAMIAN KEVITT. I AM THE

03:05:26.148 --> 03:05:27.316
FOUNDER OF STREETS ARE FOR

03:05:27.382 --> 03:05:28.450
EVERYONE, A NONPROFIT ROAD

03:05:28.517 --> 03:05:30.552
SAFETY ADVOCACY AND CO-SPONSOR

03:05:30.619 --> 03:05:33.355
OF SENATE BILL 720. I AM ALSO A

03:05:33.422 --> 03:05:35.991
VICTIM OF TRAFFIC VIOLENCE. IN

03:05:36.058 --> 03:05:37.826
2013, I WAS CYCLING IN LOS

03:05:37.893 --> 03:05:39.228
ANGELES, GOING THROUGH AN

03:05:39.294 --> 03:05:40.963
INTERSECTION WHEN I WAS HIT,

03:05:41.029 --> 03:05:43.131
PINNED UNDERNEATH A CAR, DRAGGED

03:05:43.198 --> 03:05:44.500
NEARLY A QUARTER OF A MILE FROM

03:05:44.566 --> 03:05:46.735
THE STREETS ONTO AND DOWN THE

03:05:46.802 --> 03:05:48.904
FIVE FREEWAY AT FREEWAY SPEEDS.

03:05:48.971 --> 03:05:50.639
MY RIGHT LEG WAS RIPPED OFF,

03:05:50.706 --> 03:05:52.074
ABOUT 20 POUNDS OF FLESH AND

03:05:52.140 --> 03:05:54.476
OVER 20 BROKEN BONES. LUCKILY, I

03:05:54.543 --> 03:05:56.178
DID NOT LOSE MY LIFE OR MY

03:05:56.245 --> 03:05:58.914
PASSION TO HELP OTHERS. I AM

03:05:58.981 --> 03:05:59.948
UNDERSTANDABLY VERY PASSIONATE

03:06:00.015 --> 03:06:02.484
ABOUT THE SUBJECT OF ROAD SAFETY

03:06:02.551 --> 03:06:05.087
AND ABOUT REDUCING PREVENTABLE

03:06:05.153 --> 03:06:07.189
TRAFFIC VIOLENCE. WE HAVE A

03:06:07.256 --> 03:06:08.390
PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS IN MOST

03:06:08.457 --> 03:06:10.893
CITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA DUE TO

03:06:10.959 --> 03:06:12.060
TRAFFIC VIOLENCE, WITH RED LIGHT

03:06:12.127 --> 03:06:13.729
RUNNING ACCOUNTING FOR NEARLY A

03:06:13.795 --> 03:06:16.298
QUARTER OF ALL FATALITIES ACROSS

03:06:16.365 --> 03:06:17.666
CALIFORNIA. THESE ARE

03:06:17.733 --> 03:06:19.501
PREVENTABLE TRAGEDIES HAPPENING

03:06:19.568 --> 03:06:22.804
EVERY SINGLE DAY. WE ALL HAVE

03:06:22.871 --> 03:06:24.907
THE RIGHT TO DRIVE A CAR

03:06:24.973 --> 03:06:27.009
RESPONSIBLY. NONE OF US HAVE THE

03:06:27.075 --> 03:06:28.477
RIGHT TO VIOLATE THE LAW BY

03:06:28.544 --> 03:06:29.878
DRIVING THROUGH RED LIGHTS AND

03:06:29.945 --> 03:06:31.346
INJURING OR ENDANGERING THE

03:06:31.413 --> 03:06:34.116
LIVES OF OTHERS. DESPITE SAFE'S

03:06:34.182 --> 03:06:35.717
PASSIONATE ABOUT PREVENTING

03:06:35.784 --> 03:06:36.752
TRAFFIC VIOLENCE AND THE STUDIES

03:06:36.818 --> 03:06:38.220
FROM MULTIPLE GOVERNMENT

03:06:38.287 --> 03:06:39.721
AGENCIES THAT SHOW AUTOMATED RED

03:06:39.788 --> 03:06:41.757
LIGHT, ENFORCEMENT SAVES LIVES,

03:06:41.823 --> 03:06:44.126
WE COULD NOT, IN GOOD FAITH,

03:06:44.192 --> 03:06:46.061
ADVOCATE FOR ANY CALIFORNIA CITY

03:06:46.128 --> 03:06:47.462
TO USE THE CURRENT FAILED RED

03:06:47.529 --> 03:06:49.665
LIGHT CAMERA LAW. THREE YEARS

03:06:49.731 --> 03:06:51.633
AGO, SAFE STARTED EXPLORING HOW

03:06:51.700 --> 03:06:54.736
BEST TO REFORM THE CURRENT LAW,

03:06:54.803 --> 03:06:55.871
REVIEWING THE HISTORY OF THE

03:06:55.938 --> 03:06:57.506
CURRENT FAILED LAW, THE

03:06:57.573 --> 03:06:58.807
SUCCESSES IN OTHER CITIES, AND

03:06:58.874 --> 03:07:01.043
BEST PRACTICES TO ENSURE PRIVACY

03:07:01.109 --> 03:07:03.645
YET TRANSPARENCY TO ENSURE

03:07:03.712 --> 03:07:05.914

03:08:55.323 --> 03:08:57.025
I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR

03:08:57.092 --> 03:08:59.027
HER WORK ON THIS ISSUE. I'VE

03:08:59.094 --> 03:08:59.594
BECOME LIKE RADICALIZED ON

03:08:59.661 --> 03:09:02.097
TRAFFIC ISSUES, AND IT'S BECAUSE

03:09:02.164 --> 03:09:04.032
I HAVE A FOUR YEAR OLD AND AN

03:09:04.099 --> 03:09:06.334
EIGHT YEAR OLD, AND I LIVE ON A

03:09:06.401 --> 03:09:07.569
BUSY STREET, AND I DON'T WANT

03:09:07.636 --> 03:09:09.104
THEM TO DIE. SO THAT'S THE

03:09:09.171 --> 03:09:11.006
REALITY. AND WE NEED TO DO MORE

03:09:11.073 --> 03:09:12.274
EVERY SINGLE DAY IN OUR

03:09:12.340 --> 03:09:14.142

03:09:14.209 --> 03:09:15.544
OUR CAR CULTURE HERE AND HOLD

03:09:15.610 --> 03:09:16.178
PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE WHEN THEY DO

03:09:16.244 --> 03:09:17.679
VIOLATE OUR TRAFFIC LAWS AND

03:09:17.746 --> 03:09:19.081
CREATE MORE GUARDRAILS TO KEEP

03:09:19.147 --> 03:09:20.582
OUR CYCLISTS SAFE, OUR

03:09:20.649 --> 03:09:21.650
PEDESTRIANS SAFE, OUR CHILDREN

03:09:21.717 --> 03:09:22.818
SAFE, OUR SENIORS SAFE, AND

03:09:22.884 --> 03:09:24.086
EVERYONE ELSE IN OUR COMMUNITY.

03:09:24.152 --> 03:09:26.288
SO I WOULD LOVE TO MAKE A MOTION

03:09:26.354 --> 03:09:27.656
TO MOVE THE BILL AND WOULD LOVE

03:09:27.723 --> 03:09:29.291
TO BE ADDED AS A COAUTHOR.

03:09:29.357 --> 03:09:31.426
SECOND. OKAY, MISS PELLERIN, I

03:09:31.493 --> 03:09:33.729
DO WANT TO JUST THANK THE IS.

03:09:33.795 --> 03:09:35.163
YOUR TESTIMONY WAS JUST SO

03:09:35.230 --> 03:09:36.531
POWERFUL AND I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE

03:09:36.598 --> 03:09:38.867
HERE TODAY TO PROVIDE THIS

03:09:38.934 --> 03:09:41.470
INSIGHT. ONE OF MY COWORKERS HAD

03:09:41.536 --> 03:09:43.371
HER PARTNER GOT IN AN ACCIDENT

03:09:43.438 --> 03:09:45.040
AS WELL ON A BIKE AND LUCKY TO

03:09:45.107 --> 03:09:46.508
ESCAPE WITH HIS LIFE. AND SO

03:09:46.575 --> 03:09:48.143
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY, INCREDIBLY

03:09:48.210 --> 03:09:49.911
NEEDED. AND I HAVE A LOT, A LOT

03:09:49.978 --> 03:09:51.246
OF BICYCLISTS IN MY DISTRICT.

03:09:51.313 --> 03:09:53.548
AND I TOO WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED

03:09:53.615 --> 03:09:55.117
AS A COAUTHOR. SO THANK YOU SO

03:09:55.183 --> 03:09:56.384
MUCH. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER

03:09:56.451 --> 03:09:58.386
COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE? I

03:09:58.453 --> 03:10:00.021
JUST WANT TO. OH, I'M SORRY, MR.

03:10:00.088 --> 03:10:02.224
WARD. GO AHEAD. NO, I ALSO WANT

03:10:02.290 --> 03:10:03.625
TO THANK YOU FOR THIS. I HAVE

03:10:03.692 --> 03:10:05.293
ACTUALLY BEEN A FAN OF RED LIGHT

03:10:05.360 --> 03:10:06.428
CAMERAS FOR SOME TIME, BUT HAVE

03:10:06.495 --> 03:10:08.697
BEEN VERY DISAPPOINTED HOW A LOT

03:10:08.764 --> 03:10:09.297
OF MUNICIPALITIES HAVE ROLLED

03:10:09.364 --> 03:10:13.335
THEM OUT IN RECENT YEARS, YOU

03:10:13.401 --> 03:10:14.503
KNOW, WITHOUT CERTAIN SAFEGUARDS

03:10:14.569 --> 03:10:16.805
IN PLACE, IT HAS ALLOWED FOR

03:10:16.872 --> 03:10:18.173
ABUSE. AND, YOU KNOW, CERTAINLY

03:10:18.240 --> 03:10:19.407
NOT JUST EVEN EXCESSIVE

03:10:19.474 --> 03:10:20.876
TICKETING, BUT ALSO WRONGFUL

03:10:20.942 --> 03:10:22.711
TICKETING, AND SOMETIMES ALSO TO

03:10:22.778 --> 03:10:24.312
THE BENEFIT OF THE RED LIGHT

03:10:24.379 --> 03:10:27.382
CAMERA COMPANIES THEMSELVES. SO

03:10:27.449 --> 03:10:28.483
TWO QUESTIONS REALLY. I SAW THIS

03:10:28.550 --> 03:10:29.918
IN TRANSPORTATION AND VERY HAPPY

03:10:29.985 --> 03:10:31.186
TO SUPPORT IT THERE. AND WE'LL

03:10:31.253 --> 03:10:34.289
DO SO AGAIN TODAY. BUT JUST FOR

03:10:34.356 --> 03:10:35.991
TO LOCK IT DOWN, THIS WOULD ONLY

03:10:36.057 --> 03:10:37.526
BE AUTHORIZED IF THE LOCAL

03:10:37.592 --> 03:10:39.995
GOVERNMENT WANTS TO OPT IN FOR

03:10:40.061 --> 03:10:41.029
THIS AND EVERYTHING. AND WOULD

03:10:41.096 --> 03:10:44.332
IT BE THE PROPERTY OF THE LOCAL

03:10:44.399 --> 03:10:45.901
GOVERNMENT OR THEY WOULD ALSO,

03:10:45.967 --> 03:10:47.936
THEY WOULD PROBABLY BE ELIGIBLE

03:10:48.003 --> 03:10:49.771
TO CONTRACT OUT TO A THIRD PARTY

03:10:49.838 --> 03:10:51.173
VENDOR. YES, OF COURSE THEY

03:10:51.239 --> 03:10:52.974
COULD. AND WHAT SAFEGUARDS DO WE

03:10:53.041 --> 03:10:55.610
FEEL ARE IN PLACE HERE THAT ARE

03:10:55.677 --> 03:10:57.612
GOING TO ONE, MAKE SURE THAT

03:10:57.679 --> 03:11:00.882
THERE IS I KNOW THERE'S A FINE

03:11:00.949 --> 03:11:01.483
STRUCTURE HERE, A CIVIL FINE

03:11:01.550 --> 03:11:02.684
STRUCTURE, WHICH I WHICH I

03:11:02.751 --> 03:11:05.887
CERTAINLY SUPPORT. SOMETIMES THE

03:11:05.954 --> 03:11:07.389
CONTRACT WITH THE LOCAL

03:11:07.455 --> 03:11:08.790
GOVERNMENT WAS PREDICATED ON THE

03:11:08.857 --> 03:11:10.559
OPERATOR OR THE, THE OWNER OF

03:11:10.625 --> 03:11:12.394
THAT, THE COMPANY RECEIVING A

03:11:12.460 --> 03:11:14.129
CERTAIN SHARE OF THAT. DO YOU

03:11:14.196 --> 03:11:15.997
SEE LIMITATIONS ON THAT? BECAUSE

03:11:16.064 --> 03:11:18.800
OTHERWISE I SAW A PERVERSE

03:11:18.867 --> 03:11:21.469
BENEFIT FOR THOSE COMPANY OWNERS

03:11:21.536 --> 03:11:22.270
TO SOMETIMES ADJUST THE TIMING

03:11:22.337 --> 03:11:24.039
OF IT. WE SAW A LOT THAT, YOU

03:11:24.105 --> 03:11:26.208
KNOW, HAD ACTUALLY RUN A YELLOW

03:11:26.274 --> 03:11:27.209
LIGHT. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. GREAT

03:11:27.275 --> 03:11:28.710
QUESTION. WE DID TAKE SOME MEDS

03:11:28.777 --> 03:11:30.445
FOR THOSE EXACT ISSUES, RIGHT.

03:11:30.512 --> 03:11:31.847
TURNS ON REDS, YELLOWS TIMING.

03:11:31.913 --> 03:11:33.915
BUT I'LL HAVE MY WITNESS IF IT'S

03:11:33.982 --> 03:11:35.350
OKAY THROUGH THE CHAIR. SURE. OF

03:11:35.417 --> 03:11:37.652
COURSE. SO THAT PARTICULAR

03:11:37.719 --> 03:11:39.387
POINT, THERE'S TWO POINTS OF

03:11:39.454 --> 03:11:41.223
ABUSE THAT HAVE BEEN FOUND ON

03:11:41.289 --> 03:11:43.658
THIS TECHNOLOGY AND HAVE BEEN

03:11:43.725 --> 03:11:45.327
RECOMMENDED BY AGENCIES SUCH AS

03:11:45.393 --> 03:11:47.629
THE TRIPLE A FOUNDATION,

03:11:47.696 --> 03:11:49.097
GOVERNMENT HIGHWAY SAFETY

03:11:49.164 --> 03:11:51.633
ASSOCIATION, IHS, ETC. THAT

03:11:51.700 --> 03:11:53.101
SPECIFICALLY SAYS THESE SYSTEMS

03:11:53.168 --> 03:11:54.936
SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE DONE

03:11:55.003 --> 03:11:56.504
ON A PAY PER TICKET BASIS THAT

03:11:56.571 --> 03:11:58.139
IS INSTALLED IN THIS PARTICULAR

03:11:58.206 --> 03:12:00.208
BILL. IT IS A SET CONTRACT FEE

03:12:00.275 --> 03:12:02.477
SO THAT THERE IS NO ADVANTAGE

03:12:02.544 --> 03:12:04.546
FOR THE VENDOR TO HAVE MORE

03:12:04.613 --> 03:12:07.249
TICKETS BEING DONE. IT CAN ONLY

03:12:07.315 --> 03:12:08.550
BE MONITORED BY THE CITY AND A

03:12:08.617 --> 03:12:10.285
MONTHLY RENTAL. YEAH, EXACTLY.

03:12:10.352 --> 03:12:11.720
IT'S A MONTHLY RENTAL FOR THE

03:12:11.786 --> 03:12:14.089
MANAGEMENT AND THE CALIBRATION

03:12:14.155 --> 03:12:16.491
OF THAT PARTICULAR SYSTEM. THE

03:12:16.558 --> 03:12:17.559
LAST POINT THAT YOU SHOULD BE

03:12:17.626 --> 03:12:19.060
AWARE OF, AND THIS WAS VERY

03:12:19.127 --> 03:12:20.862
SPECIFICALLY PUT INTO THE BILL

03:12:20.929 --> 03:12:22.264
EXACTLY. FOR THAT ONE POINT OF

03:12:22.330 --> 03:12:23.665
CONCERN, WHICH IS ONCE THOSE

03:12:23.732 --> 03:12:25.367
CAMERAS ARE INSTALLED, YOU

03:12:25.433 --> 03:12:29.204
CANNOT REDUCE THE LENGTH OF THE

03:12:29.271 --> 03:12:30.939
YELLOW LIGHT. YOU CAN ONLY

03:12:31.006 --> 03:12:32.707
EXTEND IT AS PER DIRECTION AND

03:12:32.774 --> 03:12:34.142
GUIDANCE WITH THAT. AND WE JUST

03:12:34.209 --> 03:12:36.244
TOOK ANOTHER AMENDMENT THAT ALSO

03:12:36.311 --> 03:12:38.813
MADE SURE THAT THAT YELLOW LIGHT

03:12:38.880 --> 03:12:41.016
LENGTH HAS TO BE CERTIFIED AND

03:12:41.082 --> 03:12:42.417
SHOWN ON THE TICKET, THAT THIS

03:12:42.484 --> 03:12:43.818
HAS BEEN CALIBRATED AND REVIEWED

03:12:43.885 --> 03:12:46.121
AND IS WITHIN THAT LEGAL LIMIT

03:12:46.187 --> 03:12:48.523
OF THAT. SO IN OTHER WORDS, IT

03:12:48.590 --> 03:12:50.659
PREVENTS THE CITY FROM ACTUALLY

03:12:50.725 --> 03:12:51.793
REDUCING THAT YELLOW LIGHT

03:12:51.860 --> 03:12:53.595
LENGTH TO AS TO INCREASE

03:12:53.662 --> 03:12:55.497
POTENTIAL REVENUE. OBVIOUSLY,

03:12:55.563 --> 03:12:57.465
ANY REVENUE CAN ONLY GO FOR ROAD

03:12:57.532 --> 03:12:58.233
SAFETY PURPOSES, BUT STILL WE

03:12:58.300 --> 03:13:00.135
WANT TO MAKE SURE THIS IS FOR

03:13:00.201 --> 03:13:01.303
SAFETY, NOT FOR REVENUE. I

03:13:01.369 --> 03:13:03.204
APPRECIATE THAT. AND THEN UNDER

03:13:03.271 --> 03:13:04.372
PURVIEW THIS COMMITTEE COMES UP

03:13:04.439 --> 03:13:06.441
OFTEN IS THE RETENTION OF ALPR

03:13:06.508 --> 03:13:08.243
DATA. I KNOW THAT YOU ARE

03:13:08.310 --> 03:13:10.045
LOOKING AT ONLY REAR, I THINK

03:13:10.111 --> 03:13:11.880
REAR FACING CAMERAS THAT CAPTURE

03:13:11.947 --> 03:13:13.982
THE REAR LICENSE PLATE. WHERE

03:13:14.049 --> 03:13:16.351
ARE THE REQUIREMENTS OR THE SORT

03:13:16.418 --> 03:13:18.053
OF, YOU KNOW, THE LENGTH OF TIME

03:13:18.119 --> 03:13:19.487
THAT THAT CAN BE STORED. I MEAN,

03:13:19.554 --> 03:13:21.389
IF IT'S OKAY THROUGH THE CHAIR.

03:13:21.456 --> 03:13:22.324
ALSO HAVE THE THIS HAS ACTUALLY

03:13:22.390 --> 03:13:24.059
BEEN A VERY LENGTHY CONVERSATION

03:13:24.125 --> 03:13:25.293
ACROSS A COUPLE COMMITTEES, BUT

03:13:25.360 --> 03:13:27.028
WE'RE SETTLED IN ON IT. SO FIRST

03:13:27.095 --> 03:13:31.333
OF ALL, ANY VISUAL DATA AND DATA

03:13:31.399 --> 03:13:34.536
ABOUT THE PERSON AND THE EXACT

03:13:34.602 --> 03:13:37.339
LOCATION IS SCRUBBED, THE PERSON

03:13:37.405 --> 03:13:40.041
IS, IS KEPT, BUT THE LOCATION OF

03:13:40.108 --> 03:13:42.410
THE TICKET IS SCRUBBED AFTER 60

03:13:42.477 --> 03:13:43.511
DAYS. ONCE THAT TICKET IS

03:13:43.578 --> 03:13:45.880
RESOLVED, IT IS GONE. OKAY.

03:13:45.947 --> 03:13:47.182
THERE ARE PROVISIONS WITHIN

03:13:47.248 --> 03:13:48.616
THERE THAT SAYS IT CANNOT BE

03:13:48.683 --> 03:13:49.951
SHARED UNLESS THERE'S A COURT

03:13:50.018 --> 03:13:52.354
ORDER. SO IT CANNOT BE KEPT FOR

03:13:52.420 --> 03:13:53.588
ANY LONGER THAN THAT. OBVIOUSLY,

03:13:53.655 --> 03:13:55.457
IF THERE'S A COURT ORDER THAT'S

03:13:55.523 --> 03:13:56.157
DIFFERENT, IF THERE'S SOME

03:13:56.224 --> 03:13:58.326
EVIDENCE OF A CRIME IN A COURT

03:13:58.393 --> 03:13:59.361
WANTS TO DO THAT, THEN THAT'S

03:13:59.427 --> 03:14:01.963
OBVIOUSLY VALID. THOSE ARE THE

03:14:02.030 --> 03:14:03.131
BIGGEST FACTORS. THE OTHER THING

03:14:03.198 --> 03:14:04.432
WITH THIS PARTICULAR ONE IS IT

03:14:04.499 --> 03:14:06.134
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ADMINISTERED

03:14:06.201 --> 03:14:07.335
BY A POLICE DEPARTMENT. IT CAN

03:14:07.402 --> 03:14:09.137
BE ADMINISTERED BY A PUBLIC

03:14:09.204 --> 03:14:11.940
WORKS OR DOT. SO IF A CITY FEELS

03:14:12.007 --> 03:14:13.608
LIKE THEY WANT TO HAVE AN EXTRA

03:14:13.675 --> 03:14:15.643
POINT OF LAYER OF SECURITY, OF

03:14:15.710 --> 03:14:16.945
WHERE THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE

03:14:17.012 --> 03:14:19.280
THE POTENTIAL OF AN ENFORCEMENT

03:14:19.347 --> 03:14:20.648
DIVISION WORKING WITH ANOTHER

03:14:20.715 --> 03:14:22.117
OUTSIDE ENFORCEMENT DIVISION,

03:14:22.183 --> 03:14:23.618
THEN YOU PUT THE WHOLE SYSTEM

03:14:23.685 --> 03:14:24.652
UNDERNEATH A PUBLIC WORKS

03:14:24.719 --> 03:14:25.887
DEPARTMENT THAT WAS NOT ALLOWED

03:14:25.954 --> 03:14:27.455
IN THE PREVIOUS LAW. IT IS NOW

03:14:27.522 --> 03:14:29.024
ALLOWED WITH THIS ONE THERE, BUT

03:14:29.090 --> 03:14:30.725
THE REQUIREMENTS ARE ON THE

03:14:30.792 --> 03:14:32.594
PRIVATE COMPANY BECAUSE I AM

03:14:32.660 --> 03:14:35.130
ASSUMING HERE THAT THEY ARE IN

03:14:35.196 --> 03:14:37.198
OWNERSHIP, I GUESS, OR IN THE

03:14:37.265 --> 03:14:39.467
STEWARDSHIP OF THAT, THAT DATA

03:14:39.534 --> 03:14:42.270
ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT. NO.

03:14:42.337 --> 03:14:44.472
YES AND NO. SO LET ME THE

03:14:44.539 --> 03:14:46.541
PROCESS IS VERY SIMPLE. FIRST OF

03:14:46.608 --> 03:14:48.877
ALL, JUST TO BE VERY, VERY

03:14:48.943 --> 03:14:50.512
CLEAR, THE ONLY PERSON THAT CAN

03:14:50.578 --> 03:14:53.448
ISSUE A TICKET IS A CITY

03:14:53.515 --> 03:14:55.250
EMPLOYEE, RIGHT. IT MUST GO

03:14:55.316 --> 03:14:56.785
THROUGH A LIVE CITY EMPLOYEE. IT

03:14:56.851 --> 03:14:58.186
CANNOT BE DONE BY AI AND IT

03:14:58.253 --> 03:15:00.255
CANNOT BE DONE BY THE VENDOR.

03:15:00.321 --> 03:15:02.757
YES, THE VENDOR IS MANAGING AND

03:15:02.824 --> 03:15:04.125
MAKING SURE THAT THAT EQUIPMENT

03:15:04.192 --> 03:15:05.994
IS DONE CORRECTLY THERE AND DOES

03:15:06.061 --> 03:15:07.429
A FIRST SCREENING TO MAKE SURE

03:15:07.495 --> 03:15:09.064
YOU'RE NOT SENDING A BUNCH OF

03:15:09.130 --> 03:15:10.331
FALSE INFORMATION OVER TO THE

03:15:10.398 --> 03:15:11.733
CITY EMPLOYEES. BUT THE CITY'S

03:15:11.800 --> 03:15:13.601
EMPLOYEES ARE THE ONES THAT ARE

03:15:13.668 --> 03:15:14.969
ACTUALLY HOLDING ON TO THAT

03:15:15.036 --> 03:15:16.504
INFORMATION. AND THAT'S WHERE

03:15:16.571 --> 03:15:17.572
THAT THAT'S WHERE THAT OCCURS

03:15:17.639 --> 03:15:20.008
THERE. THE VENDOR IS ONLY

03:15:20.075 --> 03:15:22.510
FOLLOWING THE, THE LAWS FOR THAT

03:15:22.577 --> 03:15:24.079
PARTICULAR SYSTEM THERE. AND OF

03:15:24.145 --> 03:15:25.947
COURSE, EVERY CITY HAS

03:15:26.014 --> 03:15:27.048
GUIDELINES THAT THEY CAN DO IN

03:15:27.115 --> 03:15:28.583
TERMS OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL CITY.

03:15:28.650 --> 03:15:30.285
RIGHT. AND I ASK THIS QUESTION

03:15:30.351 --> 03:15:31.352
BECAUSE THERE'S SEVERAL OTHER

03:15:31.419 --> 03:15:32.887
BILLS AND A LOT OF DISCUSSION

03:15:32.954 --> 03:15:35.190
THIS YEAR ABOUT WHO WHO HAS THE

03:15:35.256 --> 03:15:36.658
OWNERSHIP OF THIS DATA, WHO IS

03:15:36.724 --> 03:15:37.258
RETAINING IT, WHEN ARE THEY

03:15:37.325 --> 03:15:38.393
AUTHORIZED TO SHARE IT, WHO CAN

03:15:38.460 --> 03:15:40.195
GET THAT INFORMATION. AND THEN

03:15:40.261 --> 03:15:41.696
WE SEE A DISTINCT CONVERSATION

03:15:41.763 --> 03:15:43.398
BETWEEN A PUBLIC AGENCY VERSUS A

03:15:43.465 --> 03:15:44.899
PRIVATE OPERATOR. AND WE'RE

03:15:44.966 --> 03:15:47.001
TRYING TO COVER BOTH BASES HERE,

03:15:47.068 --> 03:15:48.036
TOO. AND SO IF YOU FEEL THAT'S

03:15:48.103 --> 03:15:49.304
TIGHTENED UP HERE AND

03:15:49.370 --> 03:15:50.338
EVERYTHING, I APPRECIATE BECAUSE

03:15:50.405 --> 03:15:52.107
I THINK THAT'S OF INTEREST TO

03:15:52.173 --> 03:15:53.241
THE COMMITTEE, I THINK ONE OF

03:15:53.308 --> 03:15:55.076
THE BEST PARTS ABOUT THIS BILL

03:15:55.143 --> 03:15:55.977
IS THAT WHILE WE'RE STILL

03:15:56.044 --> 03:15:57.178
TALKING ABOUT DATA, WE'VE

03:15:57.245 --> 03:15:59.347
REMOVED ANY OF THE FACIAL

03:15:59.414 --> 03:15:59.914
RECOGNITION COMPONENTS. SO

03:15:59.981 --> 03:16:00.882
THAT'S ALL OUT OF THERE. I

03:16:00.949 --> 03:16:02.617
DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO. SO

03:16:02.684 --> 03:16:03.418
YOU'RE REALLY ONLY TALKING ABOUT

03:16:03.485 --> 03:16:05.053
A LICENSE PLATE, AND THEREFORE

03:16:05.120 --> 03:16:05.653
THE REGISTERED OWNER OF THAT

03:16:05.720 --> 03:16:07.255
VEHICLE. AND ALL OF THE DATA

03:16:07.322 --> 03:16:08.790
UNDER THIS BILL IS TRANSFERRED

03:16:08.857 --> 03:16:11.159
TO THE MUNICIPALITY THAT HAS

03:16:11.226 --> 03:16:13.394
OPTED IN, AND THEREFORE THE

03:16:13.461 --> 03:16:14.662
RULES FOR HOW LONG THEY CAN KEEP

03:16:14.729 --> 03:16:17.265
IT ARE APPLICABLE TO THE THAT.

03:16:17.332 --> 03:16:18.766
YEAH. THE MUNICIPALITY.

03:16:18.833 --> 03:16:20.602
FABULOUS. THANK YOU. HAPPY TO

03:16:20.668 --> 03:16:22.270
SECOND IT. OKAY. THANK YOU. ANY

03:16:22.337 --> 03:16:26.241
OTHER QUESTIONS SEEING NONE I

03:16:26.307 --> 03:16:30.912
HAVE A QUESTION. YOU CITED THE

03:16:30.979 --> 03:16:32.814
STEADY INCREASE IN PEDESTRIAN

03:16:32.881 --> 03:16:36.117
AND BICYCLE TRAFFIC. SO I THINK

03:16:36.184 --> 03:16:38.786
WE'VE ALL WITNESSED THE

03:16:38.853 --> 03:16:40.355
CALIFORNIA STOP, THE ROLLING

03:16:40.421 --> 03:16:43.024
STOP AT INTERSECTIONS BY MAKING

03:16:43.091 --> 03:16:46.161
THE PENALTY FINE, WHICH I THINK

03:16:46.227 --> 03:16:48.329
I SUPPORT. I JUST YOU THINK

03:16:48.396 --> 03:16:50.131
THAT'S ENOUGH OF A DETERRENT IF

03:16:50.198 --> 03:16:51.900
THERE'S SO MANY ACCIDENTS? ARE

03:16:51.966 --> 03:16:55.503
WE MAKING IT UP? I MEAN, THE

03:16:55.570 --> 03:16:57.005
ENFORCEMENT IS LESS, SO I'M JUST

03:16:57.071 --> 03:16:59.007
WANT TO BE SURE WE'RE HEADED IN

03:16:59.073 --> 03:17:00.275
THE RIGHT DIRECTION HERE. YEAH.

03:17:00.341 --> 03:17:02.677
I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO JUST SAY

03:17:02.744 --> 03:17:04.312
TO YOU, I THINK THE ANSWER TO

03:17:04.379 --> 03:17:06.281
THAT IS YES, BUT I THINK IT

03:17:06.347 --> 03:17:08.216
WOULD BE GREAT FOR YOU TO HEAR

03:17:08.283 --> 03:17:09.250
FROM THE WITNESS HOW IT'S

03:17:09.317 --> 03:17:11.452
WORKING IN OTHER PLACES AND THE

03:17:11.519 --> 03:17:12.020
REDUCTION THEY'RE SEEING. I

03:17:12.086 --> 03:17:14.122
THINK THAT'S THE ROOT OF YOUR

03:17:14.189 --> 03:17:15.723
QUESTION. SO THERE HAVE BEEN AND

03:17:15.790 --> 03:17:16.257
I FORGET IF IT'S NATIONAL

03:17:16.324 --> 03:17:17.492
HIGHWAY SAFETY ADMINISTRATION OR

03:17:17.559 --> 03:17:20.128
I'M SORRY, NHTSA OR WHICH LEVEL

03:17:20.195 --> 03:17:21.362
AGENCY, BUT FEDERAL STUDY THAT

03:17:21.429 --> 03:17:23.431
FOUND THAT THERE WAS A 21%

03:17:23.498 --> 03:17:26.034
REDUCTION IN FATALITIES IN

03:17:26.100 --> 03:17:27.135
INTERSECTIONS WHERE RED LIGHT

03:17:27.202 --> 03:17:28.203
CAMERAS WERE USED. THAT'S A

03:17:28.269 --> 03:17:30.271
NATIONAL STUDY. OKAY. CALIFORNIA

03:17:30.338 --> 03:17:32.173
IS THE ONLY STATE THAT STILL

03:17:32.240 --> 03:17:33.575
DOES PICTURES OF A PERSON'S

03:17:33.641 --> 03:17:36.511
FACE. SO AND HAS THE WHOLE

03:17:36.578 --> 03:17:38.279
ANTIQUATED SYSTEM. ALL THE OTHER

03:17:38.346 --> 03:17:40.415
STATES HAVE BASICALLY VERY

03:17:40.481 --> 03:17:41.549
SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING

03:17:41.616 --> 03:17:43.851
AT. AND I DID A DEEP DIVE ONTO

03:17:43.918 --> 03:17:47.222
THE LEVELS OF PENALTIES. THE

03:17:47.288 --> 03:17:49.457
LEVELS OF PENALTIES RANGE FROM

03:17:49.524 --> 03:17:52.327
ROUGHLY AS LOW AS ABOUT $50,

03:17:52.393 --> 03:17:54.829
$75, ALL THE WAY UP TO ABOUT

03:17:54.896 --> 03:17:56.197
$200. AND THAT'S A THAT'S A

03:17:56.264 --> 03:17:58.299
ROUGH RANGE I'M GIVING YOU ON

03:17:58.366 --> 03:17:59.467
THAT. THERE WE ARE, RIGHT IN THE

03:17:59.534 --> 03:18:01.769
MIDDLE AT $100 FINE. PLUS, WE'VE

03:18:01.836 --> 03:18:03.805
ADDED THIS GRADUATED SCALE SO

03:18:03.871 --> 03:18:04.939
THAT IF THEY'RE REPEAT

03:18:05.006 --> 03:18:06.140
OFFENDERS, THAT'S GOING TO GO UP

03:18:06.207 --> 03:18:07.308
AND THAT'S GOING TO SEVERELY

03:18:07.375 --> 03:18:09.944
IMPACT. SO YOU'VE YOU'VE GOT

03:18:10.011 --> 03:18:12.547
STATISTICAL PROOF THAT WE'RE

03:18:12.614 --> 03:18:15.416
RIGHT IN THAT SWEET SPOT OF

03:18:15.483 --> 03:18:17.085
CORRECT PENALTY VERSUS

03:18:17.151 --> 03:18:18.686
OVERBURDENING. AND THAT WILL

03:18:18.753 --> 03:18:20.588
SEND A MESSAGE HOPEFULLY TO

03:18:20.655 --> 03:18:22.223
DETER. ALL RIGHT. WE HAVE A

03:18:22.290 --> 03:18:24.892
MOTION IN A SECOND. AND DO WE

03:18:24.959 --> 03:18:28.529
HAVE A QUORUM. OH THAT'S RIGHT.

03:18:28.596 --> 03:18:30.665

03:18:30.732 --> 03:18:32.100
RIGHT LET'S VOTE. OH DO YOU HAVE

03:18:32.166 --> 03:18:33.901
A CLOSING STATEMENT? PLEASE

03:18:33.968 --> 03:18:36.371
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

AMENDMENTS DUE TO THE SHORT

03:18:47.081 --> 03:18:49.250
TIMELINE BETWEEN HEARINGS. SO,

YES, THE TRANSPORTATION

03:18:50.451 --> 03:18:50.985

AMENDMENTS, THAT MUCH WE'VE

03:18:52.220 --> 03:18:53.354
TALKED ABOUT TODAY IN TERMS OF

03:18:53.421 --> 03:18:54.622
THE ESCALATING COMPONENTS. AND

03:18:54.689 --> 03:18:56.190
SO THEY JUST WE DIDN'T GET THEM

03:19:04.065 --> 03:19:04.632
ACTUALLY GOES TO YOUR QUESTION

ESCALATION IN TRANSPORTATION. WE

03:19:09.304 --> 03:19:09.871
ADDED SOME INCREASED FINES BASED

03:19:09.937 --> 03:19:11.739
ON HOW MANY TIMES YOU GET A

03:19:11.806 --> 03:19:13.141
TICKET. OKAY. SO WE'VE ACCEPTED

FROM THE COMMITTEE, RESPOND TO

03:21:08.956 --> 03:21:10.324

03:21:12.894 --> 03:21:14.996
OUTSTANDING ISSUES. THESE

03:21:15.062 --> 03:21:16.864

03:21:20.168 --> 03:21:21.068
ISSUES FROM THE CALIFORNIA

03:21:21.135 --> 03:21:23.271
APARTMENT ASSOCIATION. THEY

03:21:23.337 --> 03:21:24.672
BUILD ON PRIOR COMMITTEE

03:21:24.739 --> 03:21:26.941
AMENDMENTS THAT ARE ALREADY MADE

03:21:27.008 --> 03:21:28.309
SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS IN

03:21:28.376 --> 03:21:31.179
RESOLVING OPPOSITION. SB 52 WILL

03:21:31.245 --> 03:21:33.414
MAKE USING ALGORITHMS TO COLLUDE

03:21:33.481 --> 03:21:35.483
AND ARTIFICIALLY INFLATE RENTAL

03:21:35.550 --> 03:21:38.052
PRICES ILLEGAL IN CALIFORNIA.

03:21:38.119 --> 03:21:39.654
CALIFORNIA IS FACING A SEVERE

03:21:39.720 --> 03:21:41.255
RENTAL HOUSING AFFORDABILITY

03:21:41.322 --> 03:21:42.990
CRISIS AND THE MOST EXPENSIVE

03:21:43.057 --> 03:21:44.792
STATE TO RENT. CALIFORNIANS NEED

03:21:44.859 --> 03:21:49.130
TO EARN AN HOURLY WAGE OF $47.38

03:21:49.197 --> 03:21:50.598
TO AFFORD A TWO BEDROOM

03:21:50.665 --> 03:21:52.166
APARTMENT, WHILE THE RENTAL

03:21:52.233 --> 03:21:53.935
HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS IS

03:21:54.001 --> 03:21:56.771
NOT NEW, LANDLORDS ARE USING AI

03:21:56.838 --> 03:21:58.906
TO INFLATE RENT. BEYOND WHAT IS

03:21:58.973 --> 03:22:01.075
FAIR AI, COMPANIES ARE USING

03:22:01.142 --> 03:22:03.311
ALGORITHMS TO SET PRICES BASED

03:22:03.377 --> 03:22:05.746
ON RENTAL DATA FROM THOUSANDS OF

03:22:05.813 --> 03:22:07.915
LANDLORDS AND OTHER SOURCES.

03:22:07.982 --> 03:22:09.817
THESE AI DRIVEN, RENT SETTING

03:22:09.884 --> 03:22:12.286
ALGORITHMS TURN COMPETITORS INTO

03:22:12.353 --> 03:22:14.455
COLLABORATORS, FACILITATING A

03:22:14.522 --> 03:22:15.923
SEEMINGLY UNLAWFUL INFORMATION

03:22:15.990 --> 03:22:17.959
SHARING OPERATION THAT

03:22:18.025 --> 03:22:18.893
MANIPULATES THE HOUSING MARKET

03:22:18.960 --> 03:22:21.896
FOR AN ANTI-COMPETITIVE GAIN.

03:22:21.963 --> 03:22:24.031
ALGORITHMIC PRICING HAS BECOME

03:22:24.098 --> 03:22:26.267
DEEPLY EMBEDDED IN OUR HOUSING

03:22:26.334 --> 03:22:27.735
MARKET ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

03:22:27.802 --> 03:22:29.470
ALTHOUGH EXISTING FEDERAL AND

03:22:29.537 --> 03:22:30.805
STATE LAWS SET PRECEDENTS

03:22:30.872 --> 03:22:32.640
DEFINING A LEGAL ANTITRUST

03:22:32.707 --> 03:22:35.042
BUSINESS PRACTICES, THE USE OF

03:22:35.109 --> 03:22:36.711
AI BACKED RENT SETTING

03:22:36.777 --> 03:22:38.846
ALGORITHMS CONTINUES. LANDLORDS

03:22:38.913 --> 03:22:40.982
ARE STILL SHARING AND COMPILING

03:22:41.048 --> 03:22:42.116
COMPETITIVE DATA THROUGH THESE

03:22:42.183 --> 03:22:43.918
PLATFORMS IN A BACK ROOM,

03:22:43.985 --> 03:22:45.753
COLLUSIVE MANNER TO FIX PRICES

03:22:45.820 --> 03:22:47.588
BEYOND MARKET RATES. WHILE

03:22:47.655 --> 03:22:48.789
FEDERAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES

03:22:48.856 --> 03:22:51.559
HAVE INITIALLY INITIATED LEGAL

03:22:51.626 --> 03:22:52.560
ACTION, LOCAL GOVERNMENT

03:22:52.627 --> 03:22:54.695
OFFICIALS HAVE ALSO STEPPED IN

03:22:54.762 --> 03:22:56.531
BECAUSE WE CANNOT AFFORD TO WAIT

03:22:56.597 --> 03:22:57.899
FOR COURT DECISIONS, WHILE

03:22:57.965 --> 03:22:59.066
LANDLORDS COORDINATE RENT HIKES

03:22:59.133 --> 03:23:00.868
AND IMPOSE COMMERCIAL TERMS THAT

03:23:00.935 --> 03:23:02.970
DEEPEN THE AFFORDABILITY CRISIS.

03:23:03.037 --> 03:23:04.739
IN FACT, THIS LEGISLATION IS

03:23:04.805 --> 03:23:07.542
MODELED AFTER ONE OF THOSE LOCAL

03:23:07.608 --> 03:23:09.143
CITY ORDINANCES ADOPTED FOR THE

03:23:09.210 --> 03:23:11.913
CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. WE MUST

03:23:11.979 --> 03:23:13.481
ACT QUICKLY TO KEEP PACE WITH

03:23:13.548 --> 03:23:15.383
THE WIDESPREAD USE OF TECHNOLOGY

03:23:15.449 --> 03:23:17.385
AND RENT FIXING PRACTICES, AND

03:23:17.451 --> 03:23:19.654
TO REINFORCE PROTECTIONS FOR

03:23:19.720 --> 03:23:21.088
RENTERS SIMPLY TRYING TO STAY

03:23:21.155 --> 03:23:23.291
AFLOAT. SB 52 MAKES IT CLEAR

03:23:23.357 --> 03:23:25.359
THAT THE USE OF THESE ALGORITHMS

03:23:25.426 --> 03:23:27.161
FOR RENT FIXING IS ILLEGAL,

03:23:27.228 --> 03:23:29.530
WHILE ALSO PROVIDING MECHANISMS

03:23:29.597 --> 03:23:31.032

03:24:20.014 --> 03:24:22.483
CONTINUED TO EVOLVE. WE MUST ACT

03:24:22.550 --> 03:24:24.652
NOW TO INTERRUPT THESE

03:24:24.719 --> 03:24:26.220
ANTI-COMPETITIVE SCHEMES AND THE

03:24:26.287 --> 03:24:27.955
TOOLS THAT FACILITATE THE

03:24:28.022 --> 03:24:29.290
UNDERMINING OF A FAIR,

03:24:29.357 --> 03:24:31.759
COMPETITIVE MARKET, PARTICULARLY

03:24:31.826 --> 03:24:34.328
AS CALIFORNIA FACES A CRITICAL

03:24:34.395 --> 03:24:36.063
AFFORDABILITY CRISIS AND TENANTS

03:24:36.130 --> 03:24:38.399
GRAPPLE WITH CRUSHING RENTS,

03:24:38.466 --> 03:24:39.867
PRICING ALGORITHMS

03:24:39.934 --> 03:24:41.702
CONSERVATIVELY ADDED 3.8 BILLION

03:24:41.769 --> 03:24:44.138
IN COSTS FOR RENTERS IN 2023

03:24:44.205 --> 03:24:45.539
ALONE. THIS IS FROM RESEARCH

03:24:45.606 --> 03:24:46.974
FROM THE BIDEN WHITE HOUSE

03:24:47.041 --> 03:24:48.809
COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISORS

03:24:48.876 --> 03:24:50.611
THAT ALSO SHOWED THAT TENANTS

SUBJECT TO PRICING ALGORITHMS

03:24:52.046 --> 03:24:53.848
ARE UP TO 15% MORE LIKELY TO BE

03:24:53.914 --> 03:24:55.650
EVICTED DUE TO HIGH COSTS OF

03:24:55.716 --> 03:24:57.785
HOUSING. COMPANIES ARE ON RECORD

03:24:57.852 --> 03:24:58.886
REFERRING TO THEIR RENTAL

03:24:58.953 --> 03:25:01.122
PRICING ALGORITHMS AS DRIVING

03:25:01.188 --> 03:25:03.290
EVERY POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO

AMENDED, WILL BAN THE EXCHANGE

03:25:09.597 --> 03:25:11.265

03:25:11.332 --> 03:25:13.768
THIS IS ONE IMPORTANT STRATEGY

03:25:13.834 --> 03:25:14.669
TO ADDRESS THE COLLUSION THAT

03:25:14.735 --> 03:25:16.604

INSTANCES OF COLLUSION THROUGH

TOOLS EVOLVE AND COMPETITORS ARE

03:25:36.791 --> 03:25:38.025
ABLE TO COORDINATE AND COLLUDE

03:25:38.092 --> 03:25:41.028
ON RENTAL PRICING EVEN WITHOUT

WE AGREE COLLUSION SHOULD NOT BE

03:27:26.267 --> 03:27:27.701
TAKING PLACE. I WOULD ARGUE THAT

03:27:27.768 --> 03:27:29.403
MANY OF THE OWNERS DID NOT KNOW

03:27:29.470 --> 03:27:31.205
THAT THEY WERE INVOLVED IN A

03:27:44.985 --> 03:27:46.687
UNFAIRLY TARGETS PEOPLE WHO USE

03:27:46.754 --> 03:27:48.989
AN ALGORITHM, NOT JUST THE ONES

03:27:49.056 --> 03:27:51.425

03:27:57.364 --> 03:27:59.600
ON THE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN

03:27:59.667 --> 03:28:01.468
STANDARD. THAT'S LIKE BEING

03:28:01.535 --> 03:28:03.337
PUNISHED FOR DRIVING A CAR,

03:28:03.404 --> 03:28:04.338
SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU PROBABLY

03:28:04.405 --> 03:28:05.406
SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THERE WAS A

03:28:05.472 --> 03:28:07.942
PROBLEM UNDER THE HOOD. SB 52

03:28:08.008 --> 03:28:09.777
ALLOWS LAWSUITS BASED ON A VERY

03:28:09.844 --> 03:28:12.246
LOW LEVEL OF PROOF. JUST SHOWING

03:28:12.313 --> 03:28:14.381
THAT SOMETHING WAS PROBABLY

03:28:14.448 --> 03:28:16.617
TRUE. BUT THESE ARE SERIOUS

03:28:16.684 --> 03:28:19.119
ALLEGATIONS WITH BIG FINANCIAL

03:28:19.186 --> 03:28:21.121
RISKS. WE BELIEVE STRONGER

03:28:21.188 --> 03:28:24.391
PROOF, CLEAR AND CONVINCING

03:28:24.458 --> 03:28:25.526
EVIDENCE SHOULD BE REQUIRED

03:28:25.593 --> 03:28:26.927
BEFORE SOMEONE CAN BE FOUND

03:28:26.994 --> 03:28:29.463
LIABLE. IF A PERSON WHO CLAIMS

03:28:29.530 --> 03:28:30.931
TO BE HARMED BY A VIOLATION OF

03:28:30.998 --> 03:28:33.067
THE LAW SUES AND WINS, THEY GET

03:28:33.133 --> 03:28:35.069
ATTORNEY'S FEES. IF THE LANDLORD

03:28:35.135 --> 03:28:36.937
WINS, THEY GET NOTHING. THIS

03:28:37.004 --> 03:28:38.539
ENCOURAGES WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE

03:28:38.606 --> 03:28:40.341
FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS BECAUSE THE

03:28:40.407 --> 03:28:42.109
PLAINTIFF HAS NOTHING TO LOSE.

03:28:42.176 --> 03:28:44.612
BUT LANDLORDS FACE HIGH LEGAL

03:28:44.678 --> 03:28:47.214
BILLS. EITHER WAY, THE PEOPLE

03:28:47.281 --> 03:28:50.017
WHO BUILD AND SELL THE SOFTWARE

03:28:50.084 --> 03:28:51.919
KNOW HOW IT WORKS. THE PEOPLE

03:28:51.986 --> 03:28:53.954
WHO USE THE SOFTWARE DON'T

03:28:54.021 --> 03:28:55.756
TYPICALLY HAVE THE EXPERTISE OR

03:28:55.823 --> 03:28:57.992
THE TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE. IT

03:28:58.058 --> 03:29:00.194
TREATS BOTH GROUPS THE SAME,

03:29:00.261 --> 03:29:02.630
WHICH WE BELIEVE IS

03:29:02.696 --> 03:29:04.598
UNREASONABLE. IF LANDLORDS ARE

03:29:04.665 --> 03:29:06.333
AFRAID TO USE THE TECHNOLOGY,

03:29:06.400 --> 03:29:08.168
THEY'LL STOP. WE BELIEVE

03:29:08.235 --> 03:29:09.770
ACTUALLY THAT'S NOT HELPFUL FOR

03:29:09.837 --> 03:29:12.106
CONSUMERS WHEN IT COMES TO

03:29:12.172 --> 03:29:13.974
SERVICE AND OPERATIONS AND EVEN

03:29:14.041 --> 03:29:15.776
PRICING WHEN IT COMES TO

03:29:15.843 --> 03:29:18.913
REDUCING RENTS. THE SECOND ISSUE

03:29:18.979 --> 03:29:22.449
IS AGGREGATED DATA. SB 52 WOULD<u>%</u>

03:29:22.516 --> 03:29:25.352
NOT ALLOW THE SOFTWARE TO USE

03:29:25.419 --> 03:29:27.821
AGGREGATED DATA, SUCH AS MARKET

03:29:27.888 --> 03:29:30.324
REPORTS, TREND REPORTS AND THIRD

03:29:30.391 --> 03:29:32.192
PARTY ANALYTICS. EVEN THOUGH

03:29:32.259 --> 03:29:34.695
THIS DATA IS GENERALIZED AND NOT

03:29:34.762 --> 03:29:37.264
TIED TO ANY ONE COMPANY, WE'RE

03:29:37.331 --> 03:29:41.101
NOT ASKING THAT WE USE PRIVATE

03:29:41.168 --> 03:29:42.970
COMPETITOR DATA. WE SHOULD BE

03:29:43.037 --> 03:29:45.005
ABLE TO INCORPORATE INFORMATION

03:29:45.072 --> 03:29:47.241
THAT IS SUMMARIZED OR AVERAGED

03:29:47.308 --> 03:29:49.310
AND IT CAN BE LINKED TO IT CAN'T

03:29:49.376 --> 03:29:51.178
BE LINKED TO ANY COMPETITOR.

03:29:51.245 --> 03:29:53.414
THIS IS NOT COLLUSIVE. FOR THESE

03:29:53.480 --> 03:29:54.949
REASONS WE REMAIN OPPOSED AND

03:29:55.015 --> 03:29:56.283
ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE TODAY.

03:29:56.350 --> 03:29:58.552

PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

03:32:10.451 --> 03:32:11.985
COMPONENTS AND NOT THE LEGAL

03:32:12.052 --> 03:32:13.954
STANDARDS THAT WERE DISCUSSED IN

03:32:14.021 --> 03:32:15.422
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE PRIOR TO

CAN BE PREDATORY. WE ARE IN A

03:32:39.279 --> 03:32:41.582

THAT YOU HAVE DONE ON THIS ISSUE

03:32:54.828 --> 03:32:56.864
AND WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION

03:32:56.930 --> 03:33:00.501
WE HAVE FOR ALGORITHMIC PRICING

03:33:00.567 --> 03:33:02.302
BILLS THAT ARE GOING THROUGH THE

03:33:02.369 --> 03:33:03.670
LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW. AND

03:33:03.737 --> 03:33:06.640
THEY'RE ALL, YOU KNOW, SOME ARE

03:33:06.707 --> 03:33:09.843
BROADER THAN YOURS AND SOME ARE

03:33:09.910 --> 03:33:12.079
NARROWER. WE THERE'S THREE THAT

03:33:12.146 --> 03:33:14.481
WE'RE GOING TO BE HEARING TODAY.

03:33:14.548 --> 03:33:16.116
AND I WAS ABLE TO GET TO A

03:33:16.183 --> 03:33:18.352
POSITION OF SUPPORT WITH THE

03:33:18.418 --> 03:33:20.687
AGUIAR-CURRY BILL, WHICH THE

03:33:20.754 --> 03:33:23.157
LANGUAGE REQUIRED. OTHERS

03:33:23.223 --> 03:33:25.993
REQUIRED THAT YOU HAD TO COERCE

03:33:26.059 --> 03:33:28.328
OTHERS TO SET PRICES OR RESTRAIN

03:33:28.395 --> 03:33:30.030
TRADE THROUGH CONTRACTS AND

03:33:30.097 --> 03:33:32.132
CONSPIRACY USING A PRICING

03:33:32.199 --> 03:33:33.901
ALGORITHM. AND THE THREE BILLS

03:33:33.967 --> 03:33:36.103
TODAY GO BACK TO THE OLD

03:33:36.170 --> 03:33:37.571
LANGUAGE THAT SHE HAD BEFORE,

03:33:37.638 --> 03:33:40.440
WHICH BASICALLY PROHIBIT TWO

03:33:40.507 --> 03:33:42.843
USERS OF A SINGLE PRICING TOOL.

03:33:42.910 --> 03:33:45.445
SO I, I KNOW THAT YOU'RE GOING

03:33:45.512 --> 03:33:47.614
TO KEEP WORKING ON IT. I HOPE

03:33:47.681 --> 03:33:50.184
THAT THAT BY THE TIME IT GETS TO

03:33:50.250 --> 03:33:52.920
THE FLOOR, THAT THERE IS SOME

03:33:52.986 --> 03:33:55.289
EFFORT TO DEAL WITH THAT ISSUE,

03:33:55.355 --> 03:33:58.525
JUST LIKE ASSEMBLY MEMBER

03:33:58.592 --> 03:34:00.994
AGUILAR CURRY DID. BUT BECAUSE

03:34:01.061 --> 03:34:02.229
THIS IS THE LAST POLICY

03:34:02.296 --> 03:34:03.931
COMMITTEE, I'M JUST GOING TO

03:34:03.997 --> 03:34:06.066
STAY OFF ALL THREE OF THE BILLS

03:34:06.133 --> 03:34:07.367
TODAY AND SEE WHAT THEY LOOK

03:34:07.434 --> 03:34:09.369
LIKE ON THE FLOOR AND HOPE TO

03:34:09.436 --> 03:34:10.437
SUPPORT THEM AT THAT TIME. THIS

03:34:10.504 --> 03:34:13.774
IS A PRICE GOUGING, HUGE ISSUE.

03:34:13.840 --> 03:34:16.310
AND WHEN THERE IS COLLUSION,

03:34:16.376 --> 03:34:19.413
WHICH I THINK REALLY NEEDS TO BE

03:34:19.479 --> 03:34:22.249
PROVED PROVEN, I THINK THAT IT

03:34:22.316 --> 03:34:23.617
SHOULD BE PUNISHED. BUT BUT IN

03:34:23.684 --> 03:34:26.587
THIS CASE, I THINK THE BAR IS

03:34:26.653 --> 03:34:28.922
TOO LOW BECAUSE LIKE I SAID,

03:34:28.989 --> 03:34:32.326
USING THIS PRICING ALGORITHM BY

03:34:32.392 --> 03:34:33.994
IF MORE THAN ONE PERSON IS USING

03:34:34.061 --> 03:34:36.997
THE PRICING ALGORITHM, THEN IT'S

03:34:37.064 --> 03:34:39.533
CONSIDERED COLLUSION. SO LIKE I

03:34:39.600 --> 03:34:42.035
SAID, I KNOW YOU'VE WORKED VERY

03:34:42.102 --> 03:34:43.270
HARD AND HOPE TO SUPPORT IT ON

03:34:43.337 --> 03:34:45.572
THE FLOOR. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER

03:34:45.639 --> 03:34:47.007
QUESTIONS UP HERE FOR THE

03:34:47.074 --> 03:34:50.744
COMMITTEE? MR. WILSON? THANK YOU

03:34:50.811 --> 03:34:52.779
TO THE AUTHOR. WE HAD A CHANCE

03:34:52.846 --> 03:34:54.982
TO DISCUSS THIS YESTERDAY, JUST

03:34:55.048 --> 03:34:57.117
YESTERDAY IN DOG YEARS. I THINK

03:34:57.184 --> 03:34:59.086
THAT FELT LIKE, YOU KNOW, THREE

03:34:59.152 --> 03:35:00.087
YEARS AGO, THE WAY THIS IS

03:35:00.153 --> 03:35:01.188
GOING, WE JUST HAVE ONE MORE

03:35:01.255 --> 03:35:03.590
WAKE UP AND WE'RE ON RECESS. I'M

03:35:03.657 --> 03:35:04.324
SURE EVERYBODY APPRECIATES THAT.

03:35:04.391 --> 03:35:07.127
AND SO I HAVE A SIMILAR CONCERNS

03:35:07.194 --> 03:35:08.629
THAT WERE BROUGHT UP BY MY

03:35:08.695 --> 03:35:10.264
COLLEAGUE IN TERMS OF SOME OF

03:35:10.330 --> 03:35:12.766
THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE MADE IN

03:35:12.833 --> 03:35:14.134
THIS COMMITTEE ON A DIFFERENT

03:35:14.201 --> 03:35:18.372
BILL, I THINK HELPED REFINE IT

03:35:18.438 --> 03:35:20.407
TO ENSURE THAT IT WAS A DIRECT

03:35:20.474 --> 03:35:21.174
IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS

03:35:21.241 --> 03:35:22.943
COERCION. IT WASN'T JUST PEOPLE

03:35:23.010 --> 03:35:25.512
USING THE SAME TOOL. AND

03:35:25.579 --> 03:35:27.814
ALTHOUGH PRICE GOUGING IS

03:35:27.881 --> 03:35:29.116
COMPLETELY TERRIBLE AND WE DON'T

03:35:29.182 --> 03:35:31.685
WANT TO SEE WHERE THERE'S THIS

03:35:31.752 --> 03:35:32.919
LEVEL OF POTENTIAL COLLUSION

03:35:32.986 --> 03:35:35.622
THROUGH ALGORITHMIC MEANS, WE DO

03:35:35.689 --> 03:35:38.725
HAVE TO BE MINDFUL OF THE LAWS

03:35:38.792 --> 03:35:41.361
THAT WE CREATE AND HOW WE

03:35:41.428 --> 03:35:43.163
ENFORCE THOSE, BECAUSE THERE IS

03:35:43.230 --> 03:35:46.133
A PENALTY PROVISION, RIGHTFULLY

03:35:46.199 --> 03:35:47.501
SO. YOU WANT TO ENFORCE THIS.

03:35:47.567 --> 03:35:50.437
AND SO I, I'M GOING TO DO THE

03:35:50.504 --> 03:35:51.471
OPPOSITE OF MY COLLEAGUE IN

03:35:51.538 --> 03:35:52.939
REGARD TO HER, WHERE SHE WAS

03:35:53.006 --> 03:35:55.142
LAYING OFF ON ALL THE BILLS

03:35:55.208 --> 03:35:56.910
TODAY, I'M GOING TO GIVE THE

03:35:56.977 --> 03:35:59.012
ABILITY TO FIGURE THIS OUT AND

03:35:59.079 --> 03:36:01.248
SEE I'M GOING TO DEFER TO THE

03:36:01.315 --> 03:36:03.116
CHAIR ON THESE ON THESE THREE

03:36:03.183 --> 03:36:05.652
TODAY, BUT RESERVING THE RIGHT

03:36:05.719 --> 03:36:07.321
THAT I DO HAVE CONCERNS AND

03:36:07.387 --> 03:36:08.288
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THOSE. AND

03:36:08.355 --> 03:36:12.225
SO, YOU KNOW, NO COMMITMENT FOR

03:36:12.292 --> 03:36:13.894
BY THE TIME THIS GETS TO THE

03:36:13.960 --> 03:36:15.829
FLOOR. BUT I'M GOING TO TODAY

03:36:15.896 --> 03:36:17.197
DEFER TO THE CHAIR WITH HOPES

03:36:17.264 --> 03:36:20.300
THAT YOU FIGURE OUT HOW TO

03:36:20.367 --> 03:36:22.869
ADDRESS THE REAL ISSUE OF PRICE

03:36:22.936 --> 03:36:24.671
GOUGING IN, IN, IN A MEANINGFUL

03:36:24.738 --> 03:36:27.107
WAY THAT, THAT, THAT MAKES, YOU

03:36:27.174 --> 03:36:29.242
KNOW, COMMON SENSE AND DOESN'T

03:36:29.309 --> 03:36:30.377
CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE

03:36:30.444 --> 03:36:33.613
PEOPLE CAN JUST RANDOMLY MAKE

03:36:33.680 --> 03:36:35.148
ASSUMPTIONS AND SUE AND, YOU

03:36:35.215 --> 03:36:36.149
KNOW, AND NOT NECESSARILY SUE,

03:36:36.216 --> 03:36:37.517
BUT MAKE THESE ALLEGATIONS WHEN

03:36:37.584 --> 03:36:38.352
THEY'RE UNFOUNDED BECAUSE THE

03:36:38.418 --> 03:36:41.321
COST TO DEFEND IS A BURDEN TO A

03:36:41.388 --> 03:36:43.290
LOT OF BUSINESSES. WE SEE THAT

03:36:43.357 --> 03:36:44.991
WHERE, YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE

03:36:45.058 --> 03:36:46.593
LEAVE THE MARKET BECAUSE THE

03:36:46.660 --> 03:36:49.262
COST TO CONTINUALLY DEFEND IS SO

03:36:49.329 --> 03:36:51.465
HARD, AND IT'S BASED ON SOME OF

03:36:51.531 --> 03:36:52.399
THE LAWS THAT WE CREATE HERE. SO

03:36:52.466 --> 03:36:55.102
THANK YOU. Þ ANY OTHER COMMENTS

03:36:55.168 --> 03:36:58.739
FROM THE COMMITTEE SEEING NONE

03:36:58.805 --> 03:37:01.007
THE BILL WE HAVE A SECOND,

03:37:01.074 --> 03:37:03.110
SECOND, SECOND. WOULD YOU LIKE

03:37:03.176 --> 03:37:06.046
TO CLOSE? YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

03:37:06.113 --> 03:37:08.615
WELL, ONE I APPRECIATE THE

03:37:08.682 --> 03:37:09.916
COMMENTS FROM ALL OF THE

03:37:09.983 --> 03:37:11.084
MEMBERS. WOULD CERTAINLY LOVE TO

03:37:11.151 --> 03:37:13.120
HAVE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOWENTHAL

03:37:13.186 --> 03:37:15.689
ADDED. AS A COAUTHOR AND

03:37:15.756 --> 03:37:16.890
APPRECIATE BOTH THE CONCERNS

03:37:16.957 --> 03:37:18.191
RAISED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER ERWIN

03:37:18.258 --> 03:37:20.127
AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER WILSON. AND

03:37:20.193 --> 03:37:21.828
WE'VE DEFINITELY HAD ACTIVE

03:37:21.895 --> 03:37:22.596
CONVERSATIONS AND HAVE BEEN

03:37:22.662 --> 03:37:23.930
WORKING REALLY CLOSELY WITH THE

03:37:23.997 --> 03:37:27.901
APARTMENT ASSOCIATION. I WANT TO

03:37:27.968 --> 03:37:30.103
NOTE A COUPLE OF THINGS. AS

03:37:30.170 --> 03:37:31.438
NOTED IN MY OPENING STATEMENT,

03:37:31.505 --> 03:37:33.340
THIS BILL HAS UNDERGONE

03:37:33.407 --> 03:37:35.142
SUBSTANTIAL AMENDMENTS THAT

03:37:35.208 --> 03:37:36.543
REFLECT REQUESTED CHANGES FROM

03:37:36.610 --> 03:37:39.079
OPPOSING STAKEHOLDERS. NOTABLY,

03:37:39.146 --> 03:37:40.514
WE HAVE INCLUDED SIGNIFICANT

03:37:40.580 --> 03:37:41.581
LANGUAGE PROPOSED BY THE

03:37:41.648 --> 03:37:43.083
CALIFORNIA APARTMENT

03:37:43.150 --> 03:37:44.117
ASSOCIATION. IF THE BILL

03:37:44.184 --> 03:37:45.419
ADVANCES OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE,

03:37:45.485 --> 03:37:47.220
MY OFFICE IS COMMITTED TO

03:37:47.287 --> 03:37:49.623
CONTINUING TO WORK ON OUR MAJOR

03:37:49.689 --> 03:37:50.690
UNRESOLVED CONCERN, WHICH IS

03:37:50.757 --> 03:37:51.725
ENSURING THAT THE LIABILITY

03:37:51.792 --> 03:37:53.260
LANGUAGE CURRENTLY IN PRINT

03:37:53.326 --> 03:37:54.628
ALIGNS MORE CLOSELY WITH THE

03:37:54.694 --> 03:37:56.730
CARTWRIGHT ACT. I'D LIKE TO

03:37:56.797 --> 03:37:58.198
EXPLAIN WHY WE WERE UNABLE TO

03:37:58.265 --> 03:37:59.900
ADOPT THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE

03:37:59.966 --> 03:38:01.568
REQUESTED BY THE APARTMENT

03:38:01.635 --> 03:38:02.502
ASSOCIATION TO ADDRESS THAT

03:38:02.569 --> 03:38:03.970
ISSUE. AFTER THOROUGH REVIEW,

03:38:04.037 --> 03:38:05.839
OUR LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL ADVISED

03:38:05.906 --> 03:38:07.307
THAT ADOPTING THE PROPOSED

03:38:07.374 --> 03:38:09.776
LANGUAGE WOULD RENDER THE BILL

03:38:09.843 --> 03:38:12.913
UNCONSTITUTIONAL UNDER ARTICLE

03:38:12.979 --> 03:38:14.347
FOUR, CHAPTER NINE OF THE

03:38:14.414 --> 03:38:15.715
CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION, WHICH

03:38:15.782 --> 03:38:18.084
PROHIBITS AMENDING A STATUTE BY

03:38:18.151 --> 03:38:20.153
REFERENCE TO ITS TITLE ALONE.

03:38:20.220 --> 03:38:21.388
SINCE THE BILL CURRENTLY AMENDS

03:38:21.455 --> 03:38:23.390
THE CIVIL CODE, WE CANNOT

03:38:23.457 --> 03:38:25.258
INCORPORATE PROVISIONS FROM THE

03:38:25.325 --> 03:38:26.726
CARTWRIGHT ACT BY MERELY

03:38:26.793 --> 03:38:28.428
REFERRING TO ITS TITLE. RATHER,

03:38:28.495 --> 03:38:29.896
WE WOULD NEED TO REPRODUCE THE

03:38:29.963 --> 03:38:31.731
RELEVANT STATUTORY LANGUAGE IN

03:38:31.798 --> 03:38:33.200
FULL, WHICH IS NOT FEASIBLE IN

03:38:33.266 --> 03:38:35.302
THIS CASE. IN RESPONSE TO THE

03:38:35.368 --> 03:38:36.436
CONCERN RAISED, OUR OFFICE

03:38:36.503 --> 03:38:37.671
PROPOSED RELOCATING THE ENTIRE

03:38:37.737 --> 03:38:39.372
BILL INTO THE CARTWRIGHT ACT AS

03:38:39.439 --> 03:38:41.775
A POTENTIAL SOLUTION. THIS WAS

03:38:41.842 --> 03:38:43.743
SOMETHING THAT WE DISCUSSED WITH

03:38:43.810 --> 03:38:46.046
THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS. AFTER

03:38:46.112 --> 03:38:47.314
CAREFUL CONSIDERATION, THE

03:38:47.380 --> 03:38:48.582
COMMITTEE INDICATED THAT THEY

03:38:48.648 --> 03:38:50.817
WERE NOT PREPARED TO PURSUE THAT

03:38:50.884 --> 03:38:52.352
DIRECTION AT THIS TIME AND FELT

03:38:52.419 --> 03:38:54.154
AS THOUGH IT WAS OUT OF THE

03:38:54.221 --> 03:38:55.288
BILL'S JURISDICTION, WHICH WE

03:38:55.355 --> 03:38:56.923
COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND AS WELL.

03:38:56.990 --> 03:38:59.493
SO KNOW THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL

03:38:59.559 --> 03:39:00.527
BILLS IN THIS SPACE AND HAVE

03:39:00.594 --> 03:39:03.363
BEEN TRYING TO NAVIGATE THAT.

03:39:03.430 --> 03:39:04.531
SPECIFICALLY, THE ASSEMBLY

03:39:04.598 --> 03:39:06.600
MEMBER CURRY'S BILL IS ACTUALLY

03:39:06.666 --> 03:39:08.768
IT IS AMENDING THE CARTWRIGHT

03:39:08.835 --> 03:39:10.403
ACT, WHICH IS WHY SHE WAS ABLE

03:39:10.470 --> 03:39:12.138
TO MAKE SOME OF THOSE AMENDMENTS

03:39:12.205 --> 03:39:13.240
AND THOSE PROVISIONS. THIS BILL

03:39:13.306 --> 03:39:15.575
IS NOT IN THE CARTWRIGHT ACT. SO

03:39:15.642 --> 03:39:17.143
I KNOW IT GETS A LITTLE

03:39:17.210 --> 03:39:20.313
CONFUSING, BUT THAT IS, I THINK,

03:39:20.380 --> 03:39:21.615
JURISDICTIONALLY WHY WHY WE WERE

03:39:21.681 --> 03:39:24.651
NOT ABLE TO GO THAT ROUTE. IN

03:39:24.718 --> 03:39:26.119
ADDITION TO THAT, I KNOW I'VE

03:39:26.186 --> 03:39:27.921
SHARED THIS WITH SEVERAL MEMBERS

03:39:27.988 --> 03:39:30.657
OF THE COMMITTEE, BUT THIS BILL

03:39:30.724 --> 03:39:32.359
IS VERY NARROW IN ITS SCOPE

03:39:32.425 --> 03:39:33.894
BECAUSE I FELT AS THOUGH IT WAS

03:39:33.960 --> 03:39:36.463
VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE WORK ON

03:39:36.530 --> 03:39:38.632
STRONG REGULATIONS AROUND

03:39:38.698 --> 03:39:41.234
PROTECTING RENTAL HOUSING AND

03:39:41.301 --> 03:39:43.937
PREVENTING RENT INCREASES USING

03:39:44.004 --> 03:39:46.540
AI ALGORITHMS. I, I THINK THERE

03:39:46.606 --> 03:39:48.909
ARE CERTAINLY AI TOOLS BEING

03:39:48.975 --> 03:39:51.244
USED IN OTHER AREAS AND OTHER

03:39:51.311 --> 03:39:53.046
SPACES FOR CONCERT TICKETS AND

03:39:53.113 --> 03:39:54.447
OTHER THINGS, BUT I THINK WE CAN

03:39:54.514 --> 03:39:57.350
AGREE THAT HOUSING IS VERY

03:39:57.417 --> 03:39:59.019
CRITICAL COMPONENT THAT EACH AND

03:39:59.085 --> 03:40:00.887
EVERY ONE OF US RELIES ON AND

03:40:00.954 --> 03:40:04.157
UTILIZES THAT WITH. WITH THAT

03:40:04.224 --> 03:40:05.959
BEING SAID, THIS LEAVES US WITH

03:40:06.026 --> 03:40:07.761
AN OPPORTUNITY DURING THE SUMMER

03:40:07.827 --> 03:40:09.162
RECESS TO EXPLORE SOME NEW

03:40:09.229 --> 03:40:10.096
PATHWAYS, AND WE'RE VERY

03:40:10.163 --> 03:40:10.964
COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE

03:40:11.031 --> 03:40:12.933
APARTMENT ASSOCIATION AND TO

03:40:12.999 --> 03:40:14.634
FINDING AN APPROACH THAT

03:40:14.701 --> 03:40:16.102
ADDRESSES THEIR ISSUE. THIS

03:40:16.169 --> 03:40:17.604
POLICY REFLECTS MONTHS OF

03:40:17.671 --> 03:40:18.338
COLLABORATION AND THOUGHTFUL

03:40:18.405 --> 03:40:20.173
INPUT FROM A WIDE ARRAY OF

03:40:20.240 --> 03:40:21.875
STAKEHOLDERS, AND THAT WORK WILL

03:40:21.942 --> 03:40:23.276
CONTINUE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU

03:40:23.343 --> 03:40:24.578
ALL FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. SO THANK

03:40:24.644 --> 03:40:26.413

WHILE ALPR TECHNOLOGY CAN BE A

03:42:36.342 --> 03:42:37.777
USEFUL TOOL, IT POSSESSES

03:42:37.844 --> 03:42:40.080

CIVIL RIGHTS AND CIVIL LIBERTY

03:43:17.317 --> 03:43:19.319

THESE SYSTEMS IN HIGH CRIME

03:46:52.432 --> 03:46:53.499

03:47:00.773 --> 03:47:01.708
GOVERNMENT SURVEILLANCE HAS

03:47:01.774 --> 03:47:03.910

CIVIL LIBERTIES GROUPS IN 2023

03:48:27.193 --> 03:48:29.729
FOUND THAT 71 CALIFORNIA LAW

LAUNCHED A SEVEN MONTH

03:49:08.267 --> 03:49:09.969
INVESTIGATION INTO THE USE OF

03:49:10.036 --> 03:49:11.804
ALPR. THEY FOUND THAT ALPR

03:49:11.871 --> 03:49:13.539
SYSTEM COULD NOT DISTINGUISH,

03:49:13.606 --> 03:49:15.675
COULD NOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN

03:49:17.944 --> 03:49:20.113
AND THOSE OPERATED LEGALLY, AND

03:49:20.179 --> 03:49:21.848
THEY SUBSEQUENTLY LEARNED THAT

03:49:21.914 --> 03:49:23.649
BOTH THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE AND

03:49:23.716 --> 03:49:26.719
SACRAMENTO PD HAVE BEEN LAX IN

03:49:26.786 --> 03:49:28.187

03:49:34.193 --> 03:49:36.028
VIOLATING SB 34, WHICH IS THE

03:49:36.095 --> 03:49:39.198

03:49:51.144 --> 03:49:53.179
NOT BE RETAINED INDEFINITELY. WE

03:49:53.246 --> 03:49:54.981
ARE LIVING IN A TIME WHERE

ABORTION AND GENDER AFFIRMING

03:49:56.315 --> 03:49:57.450
CARE IS BEING CRIMINALIZED IN

03:49:57.517 --> 03:49:59.118
OTHER STATES, AND THERE IS A

03:49:59.185 --> 03:50:01.420
REAL THREAT THAT ALPR

03:50:01.487 --> 03:50:03.256

03:50:03.322 --> 03:50:05.057
IDENTIFY, TRACK AND CRIMINALIZE

03:50:05.124 --> 03:50:08.161
PEOPLE WHO TRAVEL FOR CARE IN

03:50:08.227 --> 03:50:10.096
STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA WHO ARE

03:50:10.163 --> 03:50:13.332
HELPING THOSE IN NEED. USING

03:50:13.399 --> 03:50:15.501
THIS DATA CAN SERVE AS A

03:50:15.568 --> 03:50:17.570
POWERFUL TOOL TO SOLVE CRIMES ON

03:50:17.637 --> 03:50:21.507
A HOT LIST. AND SO I DON'T WANT

03:50:21.574 --> 03:50:23.009
TO NEGATE THAT IT IS AN

03:50:23.075 --> 03:50:25.845
IMPORTANT TOOL, BUT

03:50:25.912 --> 03:50:27.713
SIMULTANEOUSLY, OUR TEMPTATION

03:50:27.780 --> 03:50:30.917
TO CAPTURE IT ALL SHOULD NEVER

03:50:34.587 --> 03:50:36.322
ALL, ESPECIALLY IN THE WAKE OF

03:50:36.389 --> 03:50:39.959
CITIES VIOLATING PUBLIC AGENCIES

03:50:40.026 --> 03:50:41.761
VIOLATING THE CALIFORNIA VALUES

03:50:41.827 --> 03:50:45.698
ACT AND SB 34. WE HAVE GIVEN

03:50:45.765 --> 03:50:47.833
AGENCIES A DECADE TO ADDRESS THE

03:50:47.900 --> 03:50:51.737
MISUSE AND THE VIOLATION OF OUR

03:50:51.804 --> 03:50:54.240
LAWS. IT IS CRUCIAL THAT WE RISE

03:50:54.307 --> 03:50:56.809
TO THIS OCCASION AND ENSURE THAT

03:50:56.876 --> 03:50:59.745
MORE THAN EVER TODAY, THAT WE

03:50:59.812 --> 03:51:01.581
HOLD OUR AGENCIES ACCOUNTABLE.

03:51:01.647 --> 03:51:03.349
AND WE PUT THESE GUARDRAILS IN

03:51:03.416 --> 03:51:05.151
PLACE AND THESE SAFEGUARDS IN

03:51:05.218 --> 03:51:08.487
PLACE FOR THE GREATER GOOD. MANY

03:51:08.554 --> 03:51:10.356
OF YOU REPRESENT CITIES AND

03:51:10.423 --> 03:51:11.257
COUNTIES WHERE LAW ENFORCEMENT

03:51:11.324 --> 03:51:14.493
AGENCIES RETAIN THIS DATA, AND

03:51:14.560 --> 03:51:16.229
THEY'RE ALREADY RETAIN THIS DATA

03:51:16.295 --> 03:51:19.432
FOR 30 DAYS. THIS BILL IS ASKING

03:51:19.498 --> 03:51:23.135
FOR 60 DAYS. AND ALTHOUGH THE

03:51:23.202 --> 03:51:24.270
OPPOSITION BELIEVES THAT

03:51:24.337 --> 03:51:25.338
RETENTION CAN HINDER THEIR

03:51:25.404 --> 03:51:28.574
ABILITY TO PURSUE CASES, EVERY

03:51:28.641 --> 03:51:31.043
SINGLE ONE OF YOU AGAIN HAS

03:51:31.110 --> 03:51:31.944
AGENCIES THAT ALREADY HAVE

03:51:32.011 --> 03:51:36.115
RETENTION POLICIES FOR 30 DAYS

03:51:36.182 --> 03:51:38.884
THAT DO NOT HOLD ALPR DATA

03:51:38.951 --> 03:51:41.153
INDEFINITELY. I BELIEVE THAT

03:51:41.220 --> 03:51:43.723
THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT ALPR

03:51:43.789 --> 03:51:45.558
DATA TECHNOLOGY IS USED

03:51:45.625 --> 03:51:47.627
ETHICALLY, LEGALLY, WHILE

03:51:47.693 --> 03:51:48.894
PROTECTING THE PRIVACY AND

03:51:48.961 --> 03:51:50.663
SAFETY OF ALL CALIFORNIANS.

03:51:50.730 --> 03:51:52.798
TODAY, I HAVE A WITNESS HERE TO

03:51:52.865 --> 03:51:55.668
TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL.

03:51:55.735 --> 03:51:57.270
REBECCA MARCUS GEORGE WITH THE

03:51:57.336 --> 03:51:58.838
CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS

03:51:58.904 --> 03:52:00.906
ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU. PLEASE

03:52:00.973 --> 03:52:02.074
PROCEED. GOOD AFTERNOON, CHAIR

03:52:02.141 --> 03:52:03.342
AND MEMBERS, REBECCA MARCUS WITH

03:52:03.409 --> 03:52:05.177
THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS

03:52:05.244 --> 03:52:06.646
ASSOCIATION, A STATEWIDE

03:52:06.712 --> 03:52:07.747
ORGANIZATION OF PUBLIC

03:52:07.813 --> 03:52:08.948
DEFENDERS, PRIVATE DEFENSE

03:52:09.015 --> 03:52:10.216
COUNSEL AND INVESTIGATORS,

03:52:10.283 --> 03:52:12.785
SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF SB 274.

03:52:12.852 --> 03:52:15.388
THIS IS NEEDED TO MAKE IT CLEAR

03:52:15.454 --> 03:52:17.423
THAT LAPR DATA CAN ONLY BE USED

03:52:17.490 --> 03:52:19.191
FOR SPECIFIED NARROW PURPOSES.

03:52:19.258 --> 03:52:21.027
AS YOUR ANALYSIS POINTS OUT, A

03:52:21.093 --> 03:52:22.595
RECENT INVESTIGATION INTO THE

03:52:22.662 --> 03:52:25.498
FOX SAFETY LAPR SYSTEM BY AN

03:52:25.564 --> 03:52:26.799
INDEPENDENT MEDIA COMPANY THAT

03:52:26.866 --> 03:52:29.068
SPECIALIZES IN TECHNOLOGY FOUND

03:52:29.135 --> 03:52:31.871
THAT FOUND THAT MORE THAN 4000

03:52:31.937 --> 03:52:34.273
STATEWIDE LOOKUPS WERE DONE

03:52:34.340 --> 03:52:36.375
EITHER DONE BY THE REQUEST OF

03:52:36.442 --> 03:52:37.410
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR AS A

03:52:37.476 --> 03:52:39.078
FAVOR TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

03:52:39.145 --> 03:52:41.013
IN FACT, AN EXPERT WAS QUOTED AS

03:52:41.080 --> 03:52:42.348
SAYING THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT

03:52:42.415 --> 03:52:44.450
REALLY LIKE LAPR BECAUSE OF THE

03:52:44.517 --> 03:52:46.252
LACK OF RESTRICTIONS ON THAT

03:52:46.319 --> 03:52:47.420
DATA. THEY DON'T FEEL THAT THEY

03:52:47.486 --> 03:52:48.821
REALLY NEED A WARRANT. AND

03:52:48.888 --> 03:52:50.356
OFTENTIMES THERE ARE NO

03:52:50.423 --> 03:52:51.957
RESTRICTIONS. THE STATE AUDITOR

03:52:52.024 --> 03:52:54.327
REPORT MENTIONED FOUND THAT

03:52:54.393 --> 03:52:55.661
THREE OUT OF FOUR AGENCIES

03:52:55.728 --> 03:52:57.496
FAILED TO ESTABLISH THESE

03:52:57.563 --> 03:53:00.066
IMPORTANT LAPR POLICIES. THE

03:53:00.132 --> 03:53:02.234
REPORT ALSO REVEALED THAT MOST

03:53:02.301 --> 03:53:03.869
OF THE INFORMATION WAS

03:53:03.936 --> 03:53:05.304
COMMINGLED. SO WE HAD CRIMINAL

03:53:05.371 --> 03:53:06.939
JUSTICE INFORMATION AND OTHER

03:53:07.006 --> 03:53:08.240
SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION

03:53:08.307 --> 03:53:10.376
ABOUT INDIVIDUALS CLEARLY

03:53:10.443 --> 03:53:11.243
POINTING OUT THE NEED FOR

03:53:11.310 --> 03:53:12.611
STRONGER SECURITY MEASURES AND

03:53:12.678 --> 03:53:15.614
MORE CIRCUMSCRIBED PROCESSES AND

03:53:15.681 --> 03:53:18.317
USE POLICIES. FINALLY, A RECENT

03:53:18.384 --> 03:53:19.385
CALMATTERS ARTICLE REPORTED THAT

03:53:19.452 --> 03:53:21.520
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES SHARED

03:53:21.587 --> 03:53:23.689
THIS DATA WITH FEDERAL AGENTS

03:53:23.756 --> 03:53:25.157
FOR NON-CRIME CRIME FIGHTING

03:53:25.224 --> 03:53:26.959
MOTIVES MORE THAN 100 TIMES JUST

03:53:27.026 --> 03:53:29.428
IN THE MONTH OF MAY, BY LAW

03:53:29.495 --> 03:53:30.730
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ACROSS

03:53:30.796 --> 03:53:32.565
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL

03:53:32.631 --> 03:53:33.933
TAKES A POSITIVE STEP TOWARDS

03:53:33.999 --> 03:53:35.835
LIMITING SURVEILLANCE OF THE

03:53:35.901 --> 03:53:38.404
GENERAL PUBLIC. BY LIMITING THIS

03:53:38.471 --> 03:53:40.206
RETENTION WITH SPECIFIED

03:53:40.272 --> 03:53:42.007
EXEMPTIONS, SB 274 CREATES AN

03:53:42.074 --> 03:53:43.409
IMPORTANT INITIAL GUARDRAIL

03:53:43.476 --> 03:53:45.678
AGAINST UNFETTERED LICENSE PLATE

03:53:45.745 --> 03:53:47.079
SURVEILLANCE, WHICH INFRINGES ON

03:53:47.146 --> 03:53:49.081
OUR PRIVACY. I ASK FOR YOUR

03:53:49.148 --> 03:53:50.683
VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY

03:53:50.750 --> 03:53:53.519
MUCH. DO WE HAVE ANY SPEAKERS IN

03:53:53.586 --> 03:53:54.920
OPPOSITION? EXCUSE ME? IN

03:53:54.987 --> 03:53:56.355
SUPPORT? HAVE I GOTTEN

03:53:56.422 --> 03:53:57.423
OPPOSITION YET IN SUPPORT?

03:53:57.490 --> 03:53:58.991
PLEASE COME TO THE MICROPHONE.

03:53:59.058 --> 03:54:01.761
THANK YOU. OF COURSE. TRACY

ROSENBERG, ON BEHALF OF OAKLAND

03:54:03.996 --> 03:54:06.766
PRIVACY, WE HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN

03:54:06.832 --> 03:54:08.367
NEUTRAL ON THE BILL, BUT AS A

03:54:08.434 --> 03:54:10.503
RESULT OF THE WORK DONE IN THIS

03:54:10.569 --> 03:54:12.271
COMMITTEE, WE THINK IT'S LIKELY

03:54:12.338 --> 03:54:14.407
WE WILL MOVE TO A POSITION OF

03:54:14.473 --> 03:54:16.742
SUPPORT SHORTLY. THANK YOU. NEXT

03:54:16.809 --> 03:54:23.015
SPEAKER, PLEASE, IN SUPPORT.

03:54:23.082 --> 03:54:24.283
THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR.

03:54:24.350 --> 03:54:25.084
ACTUALLY, WE DO NOT HAVE A

03:54:25.151 --> 03:54:26.352
POSITION ON THE BILL. MATT

03:54:26.419 --> 03:54:27.353
ROBINSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA

03:54:27.420 --> 03:54:29.288
TRANSIT ASSOCIATION. WE JUST

03:54:29.355 --> 03:54:30.956
WANT TO KEEP WORKING WITH THE

03:54:31.023 --> 03:54:32.691
AUTHOR. WE'VE BEEN IN SOME

03:54:32.758 --> 03:54:33.325
RECENT CONVERSATIONS TO RESOLVE

03:54:33.392 --> 03:54:34.527
SOME ISSUES BETWEEN THE

03:54:34.593 --> 03:54:36.362
INTERPLAY WITH THIS BILL AND

03:54:36.429 --> 03:54:37.196
LEGISLATION THAT WE ALREADY HAVE

03:54:37.263 --> 03:54:38.931
ON THE BOOKS FOR SOME FORWARD

03:54:38.998 --> 03:54:40.232
FACING CAMERAS THAT WE OPERATE

03:54:40.299 --> 03:54:42.201
ON BUSSES, WE HAVE EXTREMELY

03:54:42.268 --> 03:54:43.869
STRICT DATA RETENTION STANDARDS

03:54:43.936 --> 03:54:46.238
IN LAW ALREADY, AND WE JUST WANT

03:54:46.305 --> 03:54:48.941
TO RECOGNIZE THOSE IN THIS BILL.

03:54:49.008 --> 03:54:50.810
SO THANK YOU. OKAY. THANK YOU.

03:54:50.876 --> 03:54:52.912
NEXT SPEAKER PLEASE. MADAM CHAIR

03:54:52.978 --> 03:54:54.613
MEMBERS, ANOTHER TWEENER, ANDREW

03:54:54.680 --> 03:54:56.382
ANTHONY, ON BEHALF OF THE LOS

03:54:56.449 --> 03:54:57.950
ANGELES COUNTY METROPOLITAN

03:54:58.017 --> 03:54:58.818
TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY, WE

03:54:58.884 --> 03:55:00.386
ACTUALLY THANK THE AUTHOR FOR

03:55:00.453 --> 03:55:02.288
THE AMENDMENT THAT WAS JUST

03:55:02.354 --> 03:55:03.823
ACCEPTED ON PAGE 15 OF THE

03:55:03.889 --> 03:55:05.524
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. WE HAVE ONE

03:55:05.591 --> 03:55:06.559
MORE CHANGE THAT WE'VE SHARED

03:55:06.625 --> 03:55:08.360
WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE, AND

03:55:08.427 --> 03:55:09.862
WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT GOING

03:55:09.929 --> 03:55:11.597
FORWARD, THAT CAN BE ADDRESSED

03:55:11.664 --> 03:55:14.099
SO THAT METRO CAN CONTINUE ITS

03:55:14.166 --> 03:55:15.234
CURRENT OPERATIONS. ALL RIGHT.

03:55:15.301 --> 03:55:19.638
THANK YOU. ANY OTHER SPEAKERS IN

03:55:19.705 --> 03:55:21.373
SUPPORT? DO WE HAVE A PRIMARY

03:55:21.440 --> 03:55:23.442
WITNESS IN OPPOSITION? PLEASE

03:55:23.509 --> 03:55:25.110
COME FORWARD TO THE TABLE IF

03:55:25.177 --> 03:55:40.759
YOU'D LIKE.

03:55:40.826 --> 03:55:42.361
GOOD AFTERNOON, MADAM CHAIR. AND

03:55:42.428 --> 03:55:44.230
MEMBERS, ON BEHALF OF THE

03:55:44.296 --> 03:55:45.164
CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS

03:55:45.231 --> 03:55:48.033
ASSOCIATION HERE IN OPPOSITION

03:55:48.100 --> 03:55:51.337
TO SB 274, AS THE AUTHOR POINTED

03:55:51.403 --> 03:55:53.806
OUT, LEGISLATION FROM 2015 SETS

03:55:53.873 --> 03:55:55.641
REQUIREMENTS AND STATUTE ABOUT

03:55:55.708 --> 03:55:57.776
ACCESSING ALPR DATA. IT ALSO

03:55:57.843 --> 03:55:59.945
REQUIRES AGENCIES TO COLLECT AND

03:56:00.012 --> 03:56:02.815
RETAIN ALPR DATA TO SET IN THEIR

03:56:02.882 --> 03:56:04.950
POLICIES HOW LONG THEY ARE GOING

03:56:05.017 --> 03:56:06.385
TO RETAIN THE DATA. IT DOES NOT

03:56:06.452 --> 03:56:08.521
LIMIT HOW LONG THEY CAN RETAIN

03:56:08.587 --> 03:56:10.523
THAT DATA, AND THERE'S VERY GOOD

03:56:10.589 --> 03:56:11.490
REASON FOR THAT. AND THAT'S LAW

03:56:11.557 --> 03:56:12.558
ENFORCEMENT. AGENCIES ACROSS THE

03:56:12.625 --> 03:56:14.326
STATE AND NATION HAVE USED ALPR

03:56:14.393 --> 03:56:15.928
DATA TO SOLVE COUNTLESS CRIMES

03:56:15.995 --> 03:56:18.898
AND APPREHEND SUSPECTS. AND

03:56:18.964 --> 03:56:20.432
WHILE A LOT OF CASES ARE SOLVED

03:56:20.499 --> 03:56:23.569
QUICKLY, SOME ARE NOT. AND SO IN

03:56:23.636 --> 03:56:25.471
THESE SITUATIONS, THESE DATA CAN

03:56:25.538 --> 03:56:27.773
BE EXCEPTIONALLY HELPFUL IN

03:56:27.840 --> 03:56:29.775
SOLVING THOSE CRIMES AND SETTING

03:56:29.842 --> 03:56:31.544
A RETENTION LIMIT, SUCH AS 60

03:56:31.610 --> 03:56:34.079
DAYS IN STATUTE WILL

03:56:34.146 --> 03:56:35.314
SIGNIFICANTLY HINDER THOSE

03:56:35.381 --> 03:56:38.384
EFFORTS. THE AUTHOR MENTIONED

03:56:38.450 --> 03:56:40.619
SOME AGENCIES THAT HAVE A 30 DAY

03:56:40.686 --> 03:56:43.289
RETENTION POLICY, ONE THEY MIGHT

03:56:43.355 --> 03:56:44.757
HAVE ADOPTED THAT. THAT'S THEIR

03:56:44.823 --> 03:56:46.392
CHOICE. IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF A

03:56:46.458 --> 03:56:48.127
STATE MANDATE TO THAT 30 DAYS

03:56:48.193 --> 03:56:50.663
REFLECTS ONE COMPANY'S SO-CALLED

03:56:50.729 --> 03:56:52.464
BEST PRACTICE. IT'S NOT

03:56:52.531 --> 03:56:53.766
NECESSARILY BASED ON ANYTHING

03:56:53.832 --> 03:56:56.802
ELSE OTHER THAN THAT.

03:56:56.869 --> 03:56:58.671
UNFORTUNATELY. ALPR THE DATA,

03:56:58.737 --> 03:56:59.972
THE DATA, THE TECHNOLOGY HAS

03:57:00.039 --> 03:57:02.975
BECOME A STAND IN FOR OTHER

03:57:03.042 --> 03:57:06.879
ISSUES THAT HAVE CONCERNED SOME

03:57:06.946 --> 03:57:08.681
ABOUT CALIFORNIA VALUES. I SAY

03:57:08.747 --> 03:57:10.816
THOSE IN SMALL LETTERS, NOT

03:57:10.883 --> 03:57:12.518
CAPITAL LETTERS, BUT WHETHER

03:57:12.585 --> 03:57:13.752
IT'S REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE,

03:57:13.819 --> 03:57:15.154
WHICH WAS THE THING A COUPLE

03:57:15.220 --> 03:57:16.589
YEARS AGO NOW IT'S SORT OF

03:57:16.655 --> 03:57:17.556
SWITCHED TO IMMIGRATION THAT

03:57:17.623 --> 03:57:19.825
ALPR IS BEING USED TO FACILITATE

03:57:19.892 --> 03:57:21.660
THESE EFFORTS. THE AMENDMENTS TO

03:57:21.727 --> 03:57:23.462
THE BILL THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS

03:57:23.529 --> 03:57:24.663
OFFERED AND THAT ARE BEING

03:57:24.730 --> 03:57:25.931
ADOPTED MAKE THE BILL WORSE.

03:57:25.998 --> 03:57:27.499
CANDIDLY, THEY REQUIRE A CASE

03:57:27.566 --> 03:57:28.901
FILE NUMBER. IF YOU DON'T HAVE A

03:57:28.968 --> 03:57:30.035
CASE FILE NUMBER, YOU'RE NOT

03:57:30.102 --> 03:57:32.071
GOING TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THESE

03:57:32.137 --> 03:57:33.906
RECORDS. YOU MAY NOT HAVE A CASE

03:57:33.973 --> 03:57:35.341
YET SET UP. YOU MAY KNOW YOU ARE

03:57:35.407 --> 03:57:36.375
LOOKING FOR PARTICULAR

03:57:36.442 --> 03:57:38.410
INFORMATION. IT MAY NOT BE IN

03:57:38.477 --> 03:57:39.578
REFERENCE TO A PARTICULAR

03:57:39.645 --> 03:57:42.615
SUSPECT OR VEHICLE. THIS ALSO

03:57:42.681 --> 03:57:43.949
LIMITS THE TYPES OF HOT LISTS

03:57:44.016 --> 03:57:46.585
THAT CAN BE ACCESSED. SO FOR ALL

03:57:46.652 --> 03:57:48.053
THESE REASONS, WE RESPECTFULLY

03:57:48.120 --> 03:57:50.389
ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU.

03:57:50.456 --> 03:57:51.523
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT

03:57:51.590 --> 03:57:52.124

JONATHAN FELDMAN WITH THE

03:57:52.992 --> 03:57:53.993
CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS

03:57:54.059 --> 03:57:55.227
ASSOCIATION, ALSO STILL IN

03:57:55.294 --> 03:57:57.830
RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION. I WANT TO

03:57:57.896 --> 03:57:59.031
START WITH I'VE GOT SOME

03:57:59.098 --> 03:58:00.232
DISAGREEMENTS WITH SOME OF THE

03:58:00.299 --> 03:58:02.234
CLAIMS THAT WERE MADE BY THE

03:58:02.301 --> 03:58:03.669
PROPONENTS. THERE ARE

03:58:03.736 --> 03:58:05.504
SIGNIFICANT PROTECTIONS NOW IN

03:58:05.571 --> 03:58:07.473
PLACE FOR THE USE OF ALPR DATA.

03:58:07.539 --> 03:58:08.407
THERE'S NOT NOTHING. AND IN

03:58:08.474 --> 03:58:10.376
TERMS OF SHARING WITHOUT A

03:58:10.442 --> 03:58:11.243
STATE, THERE'S ALSO CLEAR LAWS

03:58:11.310 --> 03:58:13.145
AROUND SHARING FOR INAPPROPRIATE

03:58:13.212 --> 03:58:14.179
PURPOSES. IMMIGRATION PURPOSES.

03:58:14.246 --> 03:58:16.215
WE HAVE SB 54 THAT IS VERY, VERY

03:58:16.281 --> 03:58:18.017
CLEAR ABOUT WHAT WE CAN AND

03:58:18.083 --> 03:58:19.585
CANNOT SHARE INFORMATION. WE

03:58:19.652 --> 03:58:22.521
HAVE RESTRICTIONS DEBATED AND

03:58:22.588 --> 03:58:24.289
DEVELOPED IN LAST YEAR'S SESSION

03:58:24.356 --> 03:58:26.191
ABOUT SHARING INFORMATION FOR

03:58:26.258 --> 03:58:28.027
GENDER AFFIRMING CARE, ABORTION

03:58:28.093 --> 03:58:30.763
PURPOSES AND EVEN IN SB 34, THE

03:58:30.829 --> 03:58:31.764
ORIGINAL BILL. THERE ARE LIMITS

03:58:31.830 --> 03:58:34.366
IN SHARING INFORMATION AND

03:58:34.433 --> 03:58:36.935
PROTECTIONS FOR THAT KIND OF

03:58:37.002 --> 03:58:38.771
COLLABORATION. THAT'S

03:58:38.837 --> 03:58:39.571
INAPPROPRIATE. AND A LOT OF THE

03:58:39.638 --> 03:58:40.839
CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED HERE,

03:58:40.906 --> 03:58:42.341
THOSE ARE VIOLATIONS OF THOSE

03:58:42.408 --> 03:58:43.342
EXISTING POLICIES AND THOSE

03:58:43.409 --> 03:58:44.410
AGENCIES AND THOSE OFFICERS THAT

03:58:44.476 --> 03:58:45.811
HAVE VIOLATED STATE LAW. THEY

03:58:45.878 --> 03:58:46.979
HAVE BEEN HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR

03:58:47.046 --> 03:58:48.981
THAT, AND THEY HAVE BEEN SUED

03:58:49.048 --> 03:58:50.416
AND TAKEN TO COURT AND EVEN

03:58:50.482 --> 03:58:52.351
CRIMINAL PENALTIES AT TIMES

03:58:52.418 --> 03:58:53.452
LEVIED AGAINST THE INDIVIDUAL

03:58:53.519 --> 03:58:55.354
OFFICERS THEMSELVES. SO I SEE A

03:58:55.421 --> 03:58:56.889
LOT OF THE CONCERNS HERE, AND

03:58:56.955 --> 03:58:58.691
I'M NOT GOING TO SAY THAT THERE

03:58:58.757 --> 03:59:00.192
AREN'T ABUSES THAT ARE GOING ON

03:59:00.259 --> 03:59:01.060
THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED. THEY

03:59:01.126 --> 03:59:03.429
SHOULD BE AND THEY SHOULD BE

03:59:03.495 --> 03:59:04.163
THROUGH OVERSIGHT AND

03:59:04.229 --> 03:59:04.730
ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES. AND

03:59:04.797 --> 03:59:06.398
WE'RE NOT HERE TO OPPOSE ANY OF

03:59:06.465 --> 03:59:07.633
THE ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT THAT'S

03:59:07.700 --> 03:59:08.867
IN THE BILL. IT'S THE RETENTION

03:59:08.934 --> 03:59:09.935
POLICY THAT WE'RE MOST CONCERNED

03:59:10.002 --> 03:59:11.570
WITH THE MANDATORY 60 DAYS. YOU

03:59:11.637 --> 03:59:13.038
HAVE TO DUMP THE DATA, THE

03:59:13.105 --> 03:59:14.373
CONCERN AND THE PERSPECTIVE FROM

03:59:14.440 --> 03:59:15.974
CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS IS THAT

03:59:16.041 --> 03:59:17.876
IF WE FIND OUT A MAJOR CRIME

03:59:17.943 --> 03:59:19.778
OCCURRED IN THE 61ST DAY, AND

03:59:19.845 --> 03:59:21.080
THAT INFORMATION WOULD HAVE BEEN

03:59:21.146 --> 03:59:23.015
THERE AND WE WOULD HAVE HAD AN

03:59:23.082 --> 03:59:24.183
OPPORTUNITY TO FIND SOMEBODY OR

03:59:24.249 --> 03:59:25.484
MAYBE SAVE SOMEBODY, WE'RE GOING

03:59:25.551 --> 03:59:27.119
TO BE HINDERED IN DOING THAT.

03:59:27.186 --> 03:59:28.687
THAT IS A MAJOR, MAJOR CONCERN.

03:59:28.754 --> 03:59:30.055
THAT'S THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE

03:59:30.122 --> 03:59:31.690
POLICE CHIEFS. THEY ARE FOCUSED

03:59:31.757 --> 03:59:32.725
ON PREVENTING VICTIMS FROM

03:59:32.791 --> 03:59:33.826
GETTING HURT AND PROTECTING

03:59:33.892 --> 03:59:35.194
THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND WHILE

03:59:35.260 --> 03:59:37.463
YES, THE 30 DAYS IS IN PLACE FOR

03:59:37.529 --> 03:59:38.731
A LOT OF DEPARTMENTS, BECAUSE

03:59:38.797 --> 03:59:41.200
THAT IS THE STANDARD POLICY FOR

03:59:41.266 --> 03:59:43.302
ONE COMPANY, THAT WILL ALSO LET

03:59:43.368 --> 03:59:44.436
YOU GO ABOVE AND BEYOND. IF YOU

03:59:44.503 --> 03:59:46.105
CHOOSE TO PAY FOR MORE STORAGE

03:59:46.171 --> 03:59:47.272
AND GET A LOCAL APPROVAL FROM

03:59:47.339 --> 03:59:49.842
YOUR GOVERNING BODY, IT'S NOT 30

03:59:49.908 --> 03:59:51.276
DAYS FOR ANY OTHER REASON THAN

03:59:51.343 --> 03:59:52.878
THAT A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF

03:59:52.945 --> 03:59:54.346
AGENCIES HAVE RETENTION PERIODS

03:59:54.413 --> 03:59:55.647
LONGER, INCLUDING THE LARGEST

03:59:55.714 --> 03:59:56.749
AGENCIES IN THE STATE OF

03:59:56.815 --> 03:59:58.217
CALIFORNIA THAT DO THE MOST

03:59:58.283 --> 03:59:59.418
INVESTIGATIONS. WE'RE TALKING

03:59:59.485 --> 04:00:01.220
LAPD, LA, SHERIFF'S OFFICE,

04:00:01.286 --> 04:00:02.721
MAJOR AGENCIES IN THE BAY AREA.

04:00:02.788 --> 04:00:04.623
THE 30 DAYS IS NOT A STANDARD

04:00:04.690 --> 04:00:06.258
ACROSS THE BOARD FOR ALL OF

04:00:06.325 --> 04:00:07.926
THEM. I WOULD SAY A MAJORITY OF

04:00:07.993 --> 04:00:09.394
OFFICERS OPERATING NOW ARE UNDER

04:00:09.461 --> 04:00:10.496
POLICIES THAT HAVE LONGER THAN

04:00:10.562 --> 04:00:12.197
30 DAYS. IF YOU LOOK AT THOSE

04:00:12.264 --> 04:00:15.501
MAJOR, MAJOR AGENCIES, WE HAVE

04:00:15.567 --> 04:00:17.102
OFFERED AMENDMENTS,

04:00:17.169 --> 04:00:18.470
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE 60 DAY

04:00:18.537 --> 04:00:21.306
RETENTION LIMIT IS A SENATE

04:00:21.373 --> 04:00:22.775
APPROPRIATIONS AMENDMENT AND

04:00:22.841 --> 04:00:24.176
CAN'T BE CHANGED AT THIS POINT

04:00:24.243 --> 04:00:26.445
IN THE PROCESS, WE'VE ASKED FOR

04:00:26.512 --> 04:00:27.946
ADDING AN ADDITIONAL LOCKBOX

04:00:28.013 --> 04:00:30.282
PERIOD ON TOP OF THAT, 60 DAYS

04:00:30.349 --> 04:00:32.151
THAT WOULD ALLOW THE DATA TO BE

04:00:32.217 --> 04:00:33.919
RETAINED ONLY ACCESSIBLE BY A

04:00:33.986 --> 04:00:35.587
POLICE CHIEF OR ADMINISTRATOR,

04:00:35.654 --> 04:00:37.289
AND ONLY IN RESPONSE TO AN

04:00:37.356 --> 04:00:38.957
ACTIVE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION.

04:00:39.024 --> 04:00:41.160
AGAIN, UNDERSTANDING WE DO NEED

04:00:41.226 --> 04:00:42.728
TO DO A BETTER JOB PROTECTING

04:00:42.795 --> 04:00:43.962
THE DATA, ACKNOWLEDGING THE

04:00:44.029 --> 04:00:45.097
VIOLATIONS OF EXISTING LAW, THAT

04:00:45.164 --> 04:00:47.399
THERE SHOULD BE MORE ENFORCEMENT

04:00:47.466 --> 04:00:48.767
IN PLACE TO ADDRESS THOSE

04:00:48.834 --> 04:00:50.202
CONCERNS. BUT COMING IN AND

04:00:50.269 --> 04:00:52.271
SAYING THAT IT'S SO BROADLY

04:00:52.337 --> 04:00:53.105
ABUSED THAT WE HAVE TO JUST CAP

04:00:53.172 --> 04:00:54.239
THE DATA WE THINK IS

04:00:54.306 --> 04:00:55.574
INAPPROPRIATE AND UNFITTING. AND

04:00:55.641 --> 04:00:56.909
THERE'S BETTER WAYS TO GET AT

04:00:56.975 --> 04:00:58.110
THIS, AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO

04:00:58.177 --> 04:00:59.244
OFFER AMENDMENTS AND TRY AND

04:00:59.311 --> 04:01:00.612
WORK TOWARDS AN AGREEMENT. BUT

04:01:00.679 --> 04:01:02.214
UNFORTUNATELY, AT THIS POINT, I

04:01:02.281 --> 04:01:03.282
AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE. THE

04:01:03.348 --> 04:01:04.516
AMENDMENTS IN THE COMMITTEE DO

04:01:04.583 --> 04:01:07.352
MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO WORK

04:01:07.419 --> 04:01:11.056
THROUGH THIS POLICY. BUT I, YOU

04:01:11.123 --> 04:01:13.158
KNOW, HOPE THAT WE CAN FINALLY

04:01:13.225 --> 04:01:14.526
COME TO SOME TYPE OF RESOLUTION

04:01:14.593 --> 04:01:15.260
HERE. WE'VE DEBATED THIS

04:01:15.327 --> 04:01:16.094
RETENTION POLICY NOW FOR, I

04:01:16.161 --> 04:01:18.363
THINK, 3 OR 4 YEARS. SO I WOULD

04:01:18.430 --> 04:01:19.998
LIKE TO FINALLY GET TO A

04:01:20.065 --> 04:01:21.900
RESOLUTION, BUT IT NEEDS TO BE

04:01:21.967 --> 04:01:23.569
ONE THAT I THINK IS BETTER

04:01:23.635 --> 04:01:24.870
BALANCED THAN WHAT'S IN THE BILL

04:01:24.937 --> 04:01:26.972
NOW. SO ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. OKAY.

04:01:27.039 --> 04:01:28.540
VERY GOOD. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

04:01:28.607 --> 04:01:29.374

DEPARTMENT. AND ON BEHALF OF OUR

04:01:43.856 --> 04:01:44.289
SHERIFF, ROBERT LUNA, WE

04:01:44.356 --> 04:01:47.960
RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE. THANK YOU.

04:01:48.026 --> 04:01:49.061
GOOD AFTERNOON, LIEUTENANT JULIO

04:01:49.127 --> 04:01:50.362

LET'S BRING IT TO THE COMMITTEE,

MR. LOWENTHAL. BEFORE I, I SPEAK

04:02:07.346 --> 04:02:09.248
TO YOU, SENATOR, ON THE BILL

04:02:09.314 --> 04:02:11.016
ITSELF, I WANT TO COMPLIMENT THE

04:02:11.083 --> 04:02:12.384
OPPOSITION. ACTUALLY, WE HAVE

04:02:12.451 --> 04:02:13.185
BEEN ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF

04:02:13.252 --> 04:02:15.320
THIS ISSUE NOW FOR A FEW YEARS,

04:02:15.387 --> 04:02:17.823
AND I THINK YOU MAKE VERY

04:02:17.890 --> 04:02:18.490
COMPELLING ARGUMENTS. AND I WANT

04:02:18.557 --> 04:02:20.025
TO LET YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T

04:02:20.092 --> 04:02:21.860
SIMPLY ABOUT THE CRISIS DU JOUR

04:02:21.927 --> 04:02:23.695
THAT'S TAKING PLACE AT ANY GIVEN

04:02:23.762 --> 04:02:26.465
TIME. THERE ARE MANY OF US

04:02:26.531 --> 04:02:27.666
LEGISLATORS, AND CERTAINLY

04:02:27.733 --> 04:02:28.901
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF

04:02:28.967 --> 04:02:30.836
CALIFORNIANS THAT WANT THEIR

04:02:30.903 --> 04:02:32.504
PRIVACY SAFEGUARDED AS A

04:02:32.571 --> 04:02:34.106
FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHT. I'M ONE

04:02:34.172 --> 04:02:36.241
OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT THAT

04:02:36.308 --> 04:02:37.576
BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO START

04:02:37.643 --> 04:02:39.311
FROM A PLACE OF PRIVACY, THAT WE

04:02:39.378 --> 04:02:40.212
START FROM A PLACE WHERE

04:02:40.279 --> 04:02:42.681
GOVERNMENT DOES NOT HAVE

04:02:42.748 --> 04:02:44.116
CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE OF WHERE

04:02:44.182 --> 04:02:46.618
WE'RE GOING AND MAINTAINS THAT

04:02:46.685 --> 04:02:49.554
DATA IN PERPETUITY. AND SO WE

04:02:49.621 --> 04:02:51.723
START FROM THERE. AND SO I DON'T

04:02:51.790 --> 04:02:53.191
DISCOUNT THE VERY VALID POINTS

04:02:53.258 --> 04:02:54.693
THAT YOU ARE MAKING THAT LAW

04:02:54.760 --> 04:02:56.028
ENFORCEMENT IS HERE TO VOICE.

04:02:56.094 --> 04:02:58.931
BUT WHAT I RECOMMEND IS THAT IS

04:02:58.997 --> 04:03:00.265
THAT WHEN YOU'RE MAKING THIS

04:03:00.332 --> 04:03:02.901
CASE THAT IT'S EMPIRICAL. SO FOR

04:03:02.968 --> 04:03:04.002
EXAMPLE, INSTEAD OF SIMPLY

04:03:04.069 --> 04:03:06.071
SAYING ANECDOTALLY, IF YOU WERE

04:03:06.138 --> 04:03:08.006
TO HOLD ON TO THIS DATA, THAT

04:03:08.073 --> 04:03:09.041
THERE ARE SOME CRIMES THAT YOU

04:03:09.107 --> 04:03:11.510
WOULD BE ABLE TO SOLVE DOWN THE

04:03:11.576 --> 04:03:12.344
ROAD, WHAT PERCENTAGE OF CRIMES

04:03:12.411 --> 04:03:15.180
ARE USED? THIS DATA AFTER 60

04:03:15.247 --> 04:03:17.316
DAYS, WHAT PERCENTAGE OF CRIMES

04:03:17.382 --> 04:03:19.284
THAT ARE SOLVED AFTER ONE YEAR?

04:03:19.351 --> 04:03:21.586
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF CRIMES AFTER

04:03:21.653 --> 04:03:23.021
A CERTAIN AMOUNT? WHAT ARE THE

04:03:23.088 --> 04:03:24.356
CATEGORIES OF CRIMES THAT WE'RE

04:03:24.423 --> 04:03:26.325
TALKING ABOUT? BECAUSE OTHERWISE

04:03:26.391 --> 04:03:27.993
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ANECDOTAL

04:03:28.060 --> 04:03:30.395
DATA, ANECDOTAL INFORMATION. AND

04:03:30.462 --> 04:03:33.131
IF IT'S STRICTLY ANECDOTAL, I

04:03:33.198 --> 04:03:35.801
CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR MYSELF, BUT I

04:03:35.867 --> 04:03:38.603
WILL ALWAYS ON THE SIDE OF

04:03:38.670 --> 04:03:40.672
PRIVACY AS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT,

04:03:40.739 --> 04:03:43.809
KNOWING THAT 30 DAYS IS USED BY

04:03:43.875 --> 04:03:45.210
SO MANY DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT

04:03:45.277 --> 04:03:47.112
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT IS

04:03:47.179 --> 04:03:49.014
WHAT THE COMPANY THAT IS, THAT

04:03:49.081 --> 04:03:51.383
IS THE TECHNOLOGY BEHIND THIS IS

04:03:51.450 --> 04:03:52.184
RECOMMENDING. OF COURSE, I'VE

04:03:52.250 --> 04:03:53.618
SAID THIS IN TRANSPORTATION

04:03:53.685 --> 04:03:55.487
COMMITTEE IN THE PAST. THERE ARE

04:03:55.554 --> 04:03:57.622
A VARIETY OF STATES OUT THERE

04:03:57.689 --> 04:04:00.125
THAT HAVE EVEN LESS TIME.

04:04:00.192 --> 04:04:01.360
THERE'S SOME STATES THAT EVEN

04:04:01.426 --> 04:04:02.961
HAVE IT A MATTER OF HOURS. ONLY

04:04:03.028 --> 04:04:04.329
THE STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE IS A

04:04:04.396 --> 04:04:06.965
MATTER OF FACT, AND WE DON'T SEE

04:04:07.032 --> 04:04:08.867
THIS HUGE SPIKE IN CRIME THAT

04:04:08.934 --> 04:04:10.669
CORRELATES WITH THAT. AND IF I'M

04:04:10.736 --> 04:04:12.170
WRONG ABOUT THAT, PLEASE CORRECT

04:04:12.237 --> 04:04:14.539
ME. I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO

04:04:14.606 --> 04:04:15.173
UNDERSTAND THOSE THINGS. SO I'M

04:04:15.240 --> 04:04:18.377
VERY PROUD TO BE A COAUTHOR OF

04:04:18.443 --> 04:04:21.413
THIS BILL. THE TASK OF THIS

04:04:21.480 --> 04:04:23.248
COMMITTEE IS CONSUMER PROTECTION

04:04:23.315 --> 04:04:25.450
AND PRIVACY. AND I THINK THAT IS

04:04:25.517 --> 04:04:27.152
FUNDAMENTAL THAT WE ADDRESS

04:04:27.219 --> 04:04:29.221
SPECIFICALLY FROM A DATA CENTRIC

04:04:29.287 --> 04:04:31.123
STANDPOINT, HOW LONG WE SHOULD

04:04:31.189 --> 04:04:32.491
BE KEEPING THIS. AND UNTIL I

04:04:32.557 --> 04:04:33.792
HEAR THAT ON THE OPPOSITION

04:04:33.859 --> 04:04:35.594
SIDE, I'M GOING TO BE STANDING

04:04:35.660 --> 04:04:36.361
ON THE SIDE OF PRIVACY. BUT

04:04:36.428 --> 04:04:38.730
THANK YOU AGAIN VERY MUCH. YEAH.

04:04:38.797 --> 04:04:39.364
OKAY. WE'LL COME OVER TO THIS

04:04:39.431 --> 04:04:41.066
SIDE OF THE ROOM. WHO'S FIRST

04:04:41.133 --> 04:04:42.901
HERE, MISS WILSON? THANK YOU.

04:04:42.968 --> 04:04:44.102
THANK YOU. AND I APPRECIATE MY

04:04:44.169 --> 04:04:45.270
COLLEAGUE AS I HAVE TO GO TO

04:04:45.337 --> 04:04:47.606
LOCAL GOVT FOR LETTING ME GO

04:04:47.672 --> 04:04:50.108
FIRST BEFORE HIM. I WOULD LIKE

04:04:50.175 --> 04:04:51.676
TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND COMMEND

04:04:51.743 --> 04:04:53.612
HER FOR HER WORK ON THIS BILL

04:04:53.678 --> 04:04:55.981
AND FOR WORKING REALLY WELL,

04:04:56.048 --> 04:04:57.716
EVEN WITH MY COMMITTEE AS CHAIR

04:04:57.783 --> 04:04:58.517
OF TRANSPORTATION, AS WE SAW

04:04:58.583 --> 04:05:00.052
THIS IN TRANSPORTATION, AND WE

04:05:00.118 --> 04:05:03.188
GOT OUT WITH STRONG SUPPORT ON

04:05:03.255 --> 04:05:06.391
THIS BILL. AND LOOKING AT IT

04:05:06.458 --> 04:05:08.660
PURELY, WE DEALT WITH THE ISSUES

04:05:08.727 --> 04:05:09.561
AS IT RELATES TO TRANSPORTATION,

04:05:09.628 --> 04:05:11.263
BUT LOOKING AT IT PURELY FROM A

04:05:11.329 --> 04:05:12.164
PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION

04:05:12.230 --> 04:05:13.331
COMMITTEE. ONE OF THE THINGS

04:05:13.398 --> 04:05:15.033
THAT WE DID WITH TRANSPORTATION

04:05:15.100 --> 04:05:16.902
IS WORK WITH THE PRIVACY CHAIR,

04:05:16.968 --> 04:05:19.037
BECAUSE WE KNEW HOW IT WAS GOING

04:05:19.104 --> 04:05:20.572
TO BE BOOM, BOOM, AND THERE

04:05:20.639 --> 04:05:22.140
WASN'T GOING TO BE A LOT OF

04:05:22.207 --> 04:05:23.775
TIME. AND I KNOW THAT THERE WILL

04:05:23.842 --> 04:05:26.211
WAS LIKE SEVEN DAYS. RIGHT. AND

04:05:26.278 --> 04:05:27.012
SO THE FACT THAT IT WAS ABLE TO

04:05:27.079 --> 04:05:29.047
RETAIN 60 DAYS WAS A BIG DEAL.

04:05:29.114 --> 04:05:31.583
AND SO FROM A PRIVACY CONSUMER

04:05:31.650 --> 04:05:32.751
POINT OF VIEW, WHEN YOU THINK

04:05:32.818 --> 04:05:33.418
ABOUT WHEN A CRIME IS COMMITTED,

04:05:33.485 --> 04:05:35.720
YOU DO HAVE QUITE A BIT OF DATA

04:05:35.787 --> 04:05:36.888
AVAILABLE AT YOUR DISPOSAL. AND

04:05:36.955 --> 04:05:38.223
YOU CAN THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY

04:05:38.290 --> 04:05:40.959
FOR A HOT LIST AND THINGS OF

04:05:41.026 --> 04:05:41.526
THAT NATURE TO BE ABLE TO

04:05:41.593 --> 04:05:45.297
CAPTURE, TO BE ABLE TO CAPTURE

04:05:45.363 --> 04:05:47.199
THE INFORMATION THAT YOU MAY

04:05:47.265 --> 04:05:50.268
NEED TO USE IF THERE'S A CRIME.

04:05:50.335 --> 04:05:52.070
BUT OTHERWISE, THIS REALLY IS

04:05:52.137 --> 04:05:53.538
ABOUT ENSURING THAT PEOPLE HAVE

04:05:53.605 --> 04:05:55.674
THE FREEDOM TO BE ABLE TO LEAVE

04:05:55.740 --> 04:05:57.209
THEIR HOMES. I ALWAYS SAY WHEN

04:05:57.275 --> 04:05:58.944
YOU LEAVE YOUR HOUSE, DESPITE

04:05:59.010 --> 04:06:00.011
BEING THE PUBLIC, THERE ARE

04:06:00.078 --> 04:06:02.547
STILL A LEVEL OF EXPECTATION OF

04:06:02.614 --> 04:06:05.050
PRIVACY. AND EACH DAY, YOU KNOW,

04:06:05.117 --> 04:06:07.252
WE HEAR IN THIS COMMITTEE ALL

04:06:07.319 --> 04:06:08.086
THE TIME OF THE EROSION OF THAT.

04:06:08.153 --> 04:06:10.288
AND SO WE DO HAVE TO BALANCE

04:06:10.355 --> 04:06:11.556
THAT. WHEN YOU LEAVE YOUR HOUSE,

04:06:11.623 --> 04:06:12.090
THERE'S AN EXPECTATION OF

04:06:12.157 --> 04:06:13.258
PRIVACY. HOWEVER, IF YOU COMMIT

04:06:13.325 --> 04:06:16.228
A CRIME THAT STARTS TO GO AWAY.

04:06:16.294 --> 04:06:17.229
AND SO HOW DO WE BALANCE THAT?

04:06:17.295 --> 04:06:19.531
AND I THINK THAT THERE'S BEEN A

04:06:19.598 --> 04:06:21.833
GOOD JOB ON THIS BILL OF

04:06:21.900 --> 04:06:23.435
BALANCING THAT AND APPRECIATE

04:06:23.502 --> 04:06:25.403
YOUR WORK AND HAPPY TO MAKE THE

04:06:25.470 --> 04:06:27.472
MOTION. OKAY, MISS MACEDO, OR

04:06:27.539 --> 04:06:29.975
KEEP GOING, MR. PATTERSON.

04:06:30.041 --> 04:06:32.744
GREAT. THANK YOU. WELL,

04:06:32.811 --> 04:06:33.979
ACTUALLY. WELL, HE'S GONE NOW,

04:06:34.045 --> 04:06:35.680
BUT. WELL, MR. LOWENTHAL SAID, I

04:06:35.747 --> 04:06:37.482
THINK, YOU KNOW, I SHARE HIS

04:06:37.549 --> 04:06:40.218
VIEW ON, YOU KNOW, WHERE I COME

04:06:40.285 --> 04:06:42.587
FROM ON THIS COMMITTEE IS A IS A

04:06:42.654 --> 04:06:45.790
PLACE OF PRIVACY, YOU KNOW, AND

04:06:45.857 --> 04:06:48.193
IT DOES KIND OF I'M KIND OF

04:06:48.260 --> 04:06:49.161
STARTING OFF WITH A GOOD BUT,

04:06:49.227 --> 04:06:51.730
YOU KNOW, IT DOES KIND OF

04:06:51.796 --> 04:06:52.697
CONCERN ME THAT JUST DRIVING

04:06:52.764 --> 04:06:54.032
OUTSIDE MY HOUSE, GOING TO THE

04:06:54.099 --> 04:06:55.500
PARK WITH MY KIDS OR WHATEVER, I

04:06:55.567 --> 04:06:57.102
MEAN, I APPROVED OF THESE AND WE

04:06:57.169 --> 04:06:59.437
INSTALLED THESE IN MY OWN CITY,

04:06:59.504 --> 04:07:01.640
YOU KNOW, BUT I DON'T LIKE TO BE

04:07:01.706 --> 04:07:02.274
MONITORED EVERYWHERE I GO. I'D

04:07:02.340 --> 04:07:04.776
LIKE TO JUST BE LEFT ALONE AT

04:07:04.843 --> 04:07:09.648
TIMES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. BUT I

04:07:09.714 --> 04:07:11.216
DO THINK THAT THE OPPOSITION

04:07:11.283 --> 04:07:13.852
OFFERED SOME REASONABLE

04:07:13.919 --> 04:07:16.054
SUGGESTIONS, AND I'D LIKE TO

04:07:16.121 --> 04:07:18.089
PROVIDE WHY THOSE ARE. AND BY

04:07:18.156 --> 04:07:20.125
THE WAY, I HAD A BILL LAST YEAR

04:07:20.192 --> 04:07:22.194
TO MAKE MORE INFORMATION

04:07:22.260 --> 04:07:23.161
PRIVATE, AND ACTUALLY IT GOT

04:07:23.228 --> 04:07:24.930
KIND OF WRAPPED UP IN THE

04:07:24.996 --> 04:07:26.364
LICENSE PLATE READERS AND IT

04:07:26.431 --> 04:07:27.933
DIED AND SENATE APPROACH JUST

04:07:27.999 --> 04:07:29.367
LAST YEAR. SO I AM SENSITIVE TO

04:07:29.434 --> 04:07:31.369
THIS ISSUE, 

04:07:31.436 --> 04:07:32.938
MYSELF SUPPORTING A BILL AROUND

04:07:33.004 --> 04:07:34.673
THIS THAT KIND OF THE OPPOSITION

04:07:34.739 --> 04:07:36.541
HAD POINTED OUT. BUT IN 27,

04:07:36.608 --> 04:07:38.009
THERE'S A MEMBER OF MY STAFF.

04:07:38.076 --> 04:07:41.246
HIS NAME IS VICTOR. HE WAS A

04:07:41.313 --> 04:07:42.480
SACRAMENTO CITY POLICE OFFICER,

04:07:42.547 --> 04:07:44.849
AND IN 2017, HE USED A LICENSE

04:07:44.916 --> 04:07:48.687
PLATE READER TO APPREHEND A

04:07:48.753 --> 04:07:51.256
MURDERER, A DOUBLE MURDERER WHO

04:07:51.323 --> 04:07:54.492
KILLED HIS GIRLFRIEND AND HER

04:07:54.559 --> 04:07:56.428
DAUGHTER. HE USED A LICENSE

04:07:56.494 --> 04:08:00.298
PLATE READER. INFORMATION FOUND

04:08:00.365 --> 04:08:02.133
IT HAPPENED TO BE NEARBY WHEN

04:08:02.200 --> 04:08:04.202
THE PERSON WENT THROUGH A

04:08:04.269 --> 04:08:07.105
PARTICULAR LICENSE PLATE READER,

04:08:07.172 --> 04:08:09.107
AND UNFORTUNATELY, VICTOR WAS

04:08:09.174 --> 04:08:11.509
SHOT IN THE LINE OF DUTY AND

04:08:11.576 --> 04:08:13.345
COULDN'T RETURN TO WORK. BUT THE

04:08:13.411 --> 04:08:15.180
GOOD NEWS IS HE'S ON MY STAFF

04:08:15.247 --> 04:08:17.349
NOW, DOING A GREAT JOB, AND SO

04:08:17.415 --> 04:08:19.084
WE'RE KIND OF BENEFITING FROM

04:08:19.150 --> 04:08:20.986
THAT. AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT YOUR

04:08:21.052 --> 04:08:23.355
INTENT. I DO WORRY ABOUT PEOPLE

04:08:23.421 --> 04:08:25.223
JUST SWITCHING CARS, FOR

04:08:25.290 --> 04:08:27.392
EXAMPLE, IN THE WAY THE BILLS

04:08:27.459 --> 04:08:28.526
ARE WRITTEN, BECAUSE IT'S OKAY

04:08:28.593 --> 04:08:30.562
IF THE CAR IS A KNOWN OF A

04:08:30.629 --> 04:08:31.930
CRIMINAL, MAYBE THEY SWITCH CARS

04:08:31.997 --> 04:08:33.765
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SO WHAT?

04:08:33.832 --> 04:08:36.067
I WOULD GET MY SUPPORT AND

04:08:36.134 --> 04:08:37.369
PROBABLY DON'T NEED IT, BUT

04:08:37.435 --> 04:08:40.238
WOULD MAYBE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT

04:08:40.305 --> 04:08:42.007
KIND OF THE LOCKBOX SITUATION

04:08:42.073 --> 04:08:43.875
WHERE IN SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES,

04:08:43.942 --> 04:08:45.410
MAYBE A POLICE CHIEF, BECAUSE I

04:08:45.477 --> 04:08:46.645
DON'T WANT THIS INFORMATION TO

04:08:46.711 --> 04:08:48.113
BE USED EITHER. HONESTLY. I

04:08:48.179 --> 04:08:50.582
MEAN, AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN, I

04:08:50.649 --> 04:08:52.017
DON'T LIKE MY INFORMATION

04:08:52.083 --> 04:08:53.618
INDEFINITELY STORED ANYWHERE,

04:08:53.685 --> 04:08:55.687
WHETHER THAT'S SOCIAL MEDIA OR A

04:08:55.754 --> 04:08:57.822
CITY GOVERNMENT SOMEWHERE. SO I

04:08:57.889 --> 04:09:00.759
COME WITH THAT BASIC. BUT ALSO

04:09:00.825 --> 04:09:03.194
IF IT NEEDS TO BE USED FOR

04:09:03.261 --> 04:09:05.430
WHATEVER REASON IN THE COURSE OF

04:09:05.497 --> 04:09:07.198
A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION, AND

04:09:07.265 --> 04:09:08.667
THERE'S SOME KIND OF TRACK

04:09:08.733 --> 04:09:10.268
RECORD WHERE IT SAYS LIKE, HEY,

04:09:10.335 --> 04:09:12.237
WE NEEDED TO ACCESS THIS

04:09:12.304 --> 04:09:14.072
INFORMATION AND THEY LOG IT AND

04:09:14.139 --> 04:09:15.607
THIS IS WHY. AND SO THERE'S

04:09:15.674 --> 04:09:16.908
SOMEBODY THAT CAN BE HELD

04:09:16.975 --> 04:09:18.443
ACCOUNTABLE IF IT'S ABUSED, IF

04:09:18.510 --> 04:09:20.345
WE CAN GET TO THAT POINT, I

04:09:20.412 --> 04:09:20.945
WOULD PROBABLY SUPPORT THIS

04:09:21.012 --> 04:09:23.181
BILL, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. BUT

04:09:23.248 --> 04:09:24.883
I THINK RIGHT NOW IT GOES A

04:09:24.949 --> 04:09:26.251
LITTLE BIT BEYOND MY COMFORT

04:09:26.318 --> 04:09:27.419
LEVEL. AND FEEL FREE TO RESPOND

04:09:27.485 --> 04:09:29.821
IF YOU LIKE. THAT WAS JUST KIND

04:09:29.888 --> 04:09:31.589
OF MY TED TALK. AND SO THERE ARE

04:09:31.656 --> 04:09:34.192
CASES IN WHICH, AS IT RELATES TO

04:09:34.259 --> 04:09:36.728
WHAT YOU HAD SHARED ABOUT YOUR

04:09:36.795 --> 04:09:39.164
STAFFER FOR MURDER AND OTHER

04:09:39.230 --> 04:09:41.633
CRIMES, THEY'RE ALLOWED. THAT

04:09:41.700 --> 04:09:44.202
DOESN'T FALL UNDER THE 60 DAYS.

04:09:44.269 --> 04:09:46.004
SO AND SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE

04:09:46.071 --> 04:09:48.340
SURE THAT I WANT THAT THAT'S

04:09:48.406 --> 04:09:51.142
VERY CLEAR AND REALLY

04:09:51.209 --> 04:09:51.776
UNFORTUNATE WHEN THOSE

04:09:51.843 --> 04:09:53.345
SITUATIONS DO ARISE. BUT AGAIN,

04:09:53.411 --> 04:09:55.347
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO LIMIT LAW

04:09:55.413 --> 04:09:57.349
ENFORCEMENT FROM DOING CLOSING

04:09:57.415 --> 04:09:59.117
THOSE TYPE OF CASES. WE'RE

04:09:59.184 --> 04:10:01.653
TRYING TO ADDRESS THE PRIVACY

04:10:01.720 --> 04:10:02.654
CONCERNS, ESPECIALLY THROUGH

04:10:02.721 --> 04:10:05.523
THIS COMMITTEE. YEAH. OKAY. I

04:10:05.590 --> 04:10:07.025
APPRECIATE AND CERTAINLY THANK

04:10:07.092 --> 04:10:08.526
YOU FOR YOUR THOUGHTS AND

04:10:08.593 --> 04:10:09.828
FEEDBACK. GREAT. THANK YOU VERY

04:10:09.894 --> 04:10:12.030
MUCH. NEXT, MISS MACEDO. THANK

04:10:12.097 --> 04:10:14.299
YOU, MADAM CHAIR. I JUST WANT TO

04:10:14.366 --> 04:10:16.134
COMPLIMENT THE OPPOSITION. I

04:10:16.201 --> 04:10:17.102
HEAR OPPOSITION SO MANY TIMES

04:10:17.168 --> 04:10:18.570
THAT COME HERE JUST TO OPPOSE

04:10:18.636 --> 04:10:20.138
BILLS AND THEY DON'T OFFER

04:10:20.205 --> 04:10:21.339
SOLUTIONS. YOU GUYS OFFERED A

04:10:21.406 --> 04:10:22.841
SOLUTION AND THE SOLUTION YOU

04:10:22.907 --> 04:10:24.242
OFFERED IS SOMETHING I 100%

04:10:24.309 --> 04:10:25.410
COULD SUPPORT. SO GREAT JOB TO

04:10:25.477 --> 04:10:27.245
YOU. AND I WANT TO THANK ALL THE

04:10:27.312 --> 04:10:29.047
MEN AND WOMEN THAT YOU REPRESENT

04:10:29.114 --> 04:10:30.815
THAT KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE.

04:10:30.882 --> 04:10:32.050
RIGHT NOW. IT FEELS LIKE A VERY

04:10:32.117 --> 04:10:33.952
THANKLESS JOB DOING WHAT THEY'RE

04:10:34.018 --> 04:10:35.487
DOING, AND I DON'T KNOW WHY

04:10:35.553 --> 04:10:36.421
WE'RE TAKING MORE TOOLS AWAY.

04:10:36.488 --> 04:10:38.490
AND AS SOMEBODY WHO WILL ECHO

04:10:38.556 --> 04:10:39.491
WHAT MULTIPLE MEMBERS OF THIS

04:10:39.557 --> 04:10:40.925
DÍAS HAVE SAID, I VALUE MY

04:10:40.992 --> 04:10:43.328
PRIVACY AS A CITIZEN. HOWEVER, I

04:10:43.395 --> 04:10:45.130
AM WILLING TO SACRIFICE SOME OF

04:10:45.196 --> 04:10:46.998
THAT IF THAT MEANS BRINGING

04:10:47.065 --> 04:10:48.299
CRIMINALS TO JUSTICE AND GETTING

04:10:48.366 --> 04:10:50.235
JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS. SO WITH

04:10:50.301 --> 04:10:51.569
THAT BEING SAID, I CANNOT

04:10:51.636 --> 04:10:52.704
SUPPORT THIS, BUT I REALLY DO

04:10:52.771 --> 04:10:54.472
ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR TO WORK

04:10:54.539 --> 04:10:55.273
WITH OPPOSITION BECAUSE THEY

04:10:55.340 --> 04:10:56.408
HAVE SOME REALLY GREAT IDEAS TO

04:10:56.474 --> 04:10:57.409
ACCOMPLISH WHAT I THINK YOU'RE

04:10:57.475 --> 04:10:59.878
TRYING TO GET TO, BUT MAKING

04:10:59.944 --> 04:11:00.979
SURE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN DO

04:11:01.045 --> 04:11:03.915
THEIR JOB AS WELL. THANK YOU.

04:11:03.982 --> 04:11:05.617
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS BY THE

04:11:05.683 --> 04:11:07.986
COMMITTEE? I HAVE A QUESTION.

04:11:08.052 --> 04:11:11.022
I'VE OFTEN WONDERED THIS. I DO

04:11:11.089 --> 04:11:12.924
VALUE OUR PRIVACY AND THE RIGHT

04:11:12.991 --> 04:11:14.926
TO PRIVACY IN THIS COUNTRY.

04:11:14.993 --> 04:11:16.961
WHAT? I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO

04:11:17.028 --> 04:11:18.296
THIS. NOT A TRICK QUESTION. WHAT

04:11:18.363 --> 04:11:20.432
IS OUR EXPECTATION WHEN WE HAVE

04:11:20.498 --> 04:11:22.934
A LICENSE PLATE ON OUR CAR THAT

04:11:23.001 --> 04:11:26.271
IS, GOES THROUGH PROPER CHANNELS

04:11:26.337 --> 04:11:27.505
TO OBTAIN AND WITH OUR VEHICLE

04:11:27.572 --> 04:11:28.606
IDENTIFICATION NUMBER, IT HAS

04:11:28.673 --> 04:11:30.842
OUR INFORMATION. WHAT IS THE

04:11:30.909 --> 04:11:32.844
EXPECTATION OF CITIZENS FOR THE

04:11:32.911 --> 04:11:34.512
RIGHT OF PRIVACY? I DO NOT KNOW

04:11:34.579 --> 04:11:36.948
THE ANSWER. PLEASE, MADAM CHAIR,

04:11:37.015 --> 04:11:39.484
THROUGH THE CHAIR. I THINK THE

04:11:39.551 --> 04:11:41.286
ANSWER IS IN YOUR QUESTION THAT

04:11:41.352 --> 04:11:43.455
YOU, DESPITE THE DESIRE OR AN

04:11:43.521 --> 04:11:44.556
EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY WHEN YOU

04:11:44.622 --> 04:11:46.324
WALK OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE, GET IN

04:11:46.391 --> 04:11:47.625
A CAR THAT HAS A GOVERNMENT

04:11:47.692 --> 04:11:50.228
ISSUED PIECE OF METAL ON IT. YOU

04:11:50.295 --> 04:11:52.030
DON'T REALLY HAVE AN EXPECTATION

04:11:52.096 --> 04:11:53.898
OF PRIVACY IN THAT REGARD. AND

04:11:53.965 --> 04:11:55.333
TO BE CLEAR, LICENSE PLATE

04:11:55.400 --> 04:11:57.135
READER CAMERAS TAKE A PICTURE OF

04:11:57.202 --> 04:11:58.970
THE LICENSE PLATE, A PART OF THE

04:11:59.037 --> 04:12:00.205
CAR, AND THEY RECORD A TIME AND

04:12:00.271 --> 04:12:01.873
LOCATION. UNLESS SOMEBODY

04:12:01.940 --> 04:12:03.908
ACCESSES THAT AND KNOWS THAT.

04:12:03.975 --> 04:12:05.844
ASSEMBLY MEMBER DIXON DRIVES A

04:12:05.910 --> 04:12:07.178
BLUE HONDA WITH LICENSE PLATE

04:12:07.245 --> 04:12:10.148
ABC 123, ALL THEY'RE GOING TO

04:12:10.215 --> 04:12:11.850
KNOW IS THAT A BLUE HONDA WITH

04:12:11.916 --> 04:12:13.551
ABC ONE, TWO, THREE LEFT A

04:12:13.618 --> 04:12:15.553
DRIVEWAY OR, YOU KNOW, WENT TO

04:12:15.620 --> 04:12:17.322
THE GROCERY STORE OR WHATEVER.

04:12:17.388 --> 04:12:19.090
SO THERE THERE REALLY ISN'T AN

04:12:19.157 --> 04:12:20.458
EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY. AND I

04:12:20.525 --> 04:12:21.593
BELIEVE THERE IS CASE LAW, IN

04:12:21.659 --> 04:12:24.662
FACT, ABOUT THE CAPTURING OF

04:12:24.729 --> 04:12:25.497
IMAGES LIKE THAT THAT IS

04:12:25.563 --> 04:12:27.799
PROTECTED BY THE FIRST AMENDMENT

04:12:27.866 --> 04:12:29.901
IN REGARDS TO JUST THE SIMPLE

04:12:29.968 --> 04:12:31.669
ACT OF RECORDING THAT

04:12:31.736 --> 04:12:33.137
INFORMATION. WELL, AND

04:12:33.204 --> 04:12:34.272
SIMILARLY, WE'RE ALL

04:12:34.339 --> 04:12:36.107
EXPERIENCING NOW, WHEN YOU GO TO

04:12:36.174 --> 04:12:37.642
AIRPORT, TSA TAKES YOUR PICTURE.

04:12:37.709 --> 04:12:40.678
NOW THAT'S A VOLUNTARY PHOTO. WE

04:12:40.745 --> 04:12:42.313
OF COURSE, MANY OF US DO THIS

04:12:42.380 --> 04:12:45.683
EVERY WEEK, MULTIPLE TIMES. AND

04:12:45.750 --> 04:12:47.585
OTHER DAY I WAS I WAS LOOKING AT

04:12:47.652 --> 04:12:49.487
MY PHONE AND COMING THROUGH TSA

04:12:49.554 --> 04:12:51.456
AND HE SAID, TAKE YOUR PICTURE.

04:12:51.523 --> 04:12:53.191
AND I SAID, OH, I DIDN'T THINK

04:12:53.258 --> 04:12:54.726
WE HAD TO. IT'S OPTIONAL. IT

04:12:54.792 --> 04:12:56.394
SAYS ON THAT LITTLE SIGN, IT'S

04:12:56.461 --> 04:12:58.029
OPTIONAL. AND HE DIDN'T RESIST,

04:12:58.096 --> 04:13:02.433
BUT I MEAN, YOU MAKE A GOOD

04:13:02.500 --> 04:13:03.968
POINT ABOUT GOVERNMENT ISSUED

04:13:04.035 --> 04:13:05.270
IDENTIFICATIONS. WE ALL WANT TO

04:13:05.336 --> 04:13:07.438
SAVE. WE ALL WANT TO PROTECT OUR

04:13:07.505 --> 04:13:08.806
PRIVACY. AND I GUESS I'M

04:13:08.873 --> 04:13:09.841
PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE WHEN

04:13:09.908 --> 04:13:10.975
CRIMES ARE COMMITTED. AND THIS

04:13:11.042 --> 04:13:14.178
IS EVIDENTIARY EVIDENCE TO BE

04:13:14.245 --> 04:13:16.648
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE IN A

04:13:16.714 --> 04:13:20.451
CRIMINAL TRIAL AND POSSESSION

04:13:20.518 --> 04:13:22.921
AFTER 60 DAYS MAY TAKE I IT MAY

04:13:22.987 --> 04:13:25.690
BE REQUIRED. I DO KNOW CRIMES IN

04:13:25.757 --> 04:13:27.926
IN MY COMMUNITY THAT THEY

04:13:27.992 --> 04:13:30.194
RECENTLY IN THE LAST TWO YEARS

04:13:30.261 --> 04:13:34.732
THEY DID FIND THE PERPETRATOR BY

04:13:34.799 --> 04:13:35.800
RECOGNIZING OR THAT CAR CAME

04:13:35.867 --> 04:13:37.969
BACK INTO TOWN. AND I THINK THIS

04:13:38.036 --> 04:13:39.370
WAS JUST IN THE PAPER RECENTLY

04:13:39.437 --> 04:13:42.240
THAT THEY FOUND THE PERSON, THE

04:13:42.307 --> 04:13:43.641
ALLEGED CRIMINAL, BECAUSE THEY

04:13:43.708 --> 04:13:45.476
RETURNED TO TOWN TO COMMIT A

04:13:45.543 --> 04:13:48.046
CRIME, AND THEY KNEW THAT HE HAD

04:13:48.112 --> 04:13:49.547
BEEN THERE A YEAR OR TWO BEFORE

04:13:49.614 --> 04:13:51.249
AND HAD NEVER BEEN APPREHENDED

04:13:51.316 --> 04:13:53.451
ANYWAY. SO IT'S A DIFFICULT

04:13:53.518 --> 04:13:54.986
SUBJECT. I THINK WE ALL FEEL

04:13:55.053 --> 04:13:56.921
VERY STRONGLY ABOUT PRIVACY AND

04:13:56.988 --> 04:13:59.190
WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT,

04:13:59.257 --> 04:14:01.292
AND I APPRECIATE YOUR STATEMENTS

04:14:01.359 --> 04:14:03.027
AS WELL. AND I THANK YOU FOR

04:14:03.094 --> 04:14:04.629
YOUR BILL. IS THERE ANY MORE?

04:14:04.696 --> 04:14:05.330
ANY OTHER COMMENTS? WOULD YOU

04:14:05.396 --> 04:14:07.665
LIKE TO MAKE A CLOSING COMMENTS?

04:14:07.732 --> 04:14:08.466
THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR. AND JUST

04:14:08.533 --> 04:14:10.702
IN SOMETHING THAT YOU HAD JUST

04:14:10.768 --> 04:14:12.036
MENTIONED, YOU KNOW, IN THE

04:14:12.103 --> 04:14:14.339
INTEREST OF JUSTICE, MURDER AND

04:14:14.405 --> 04:14:17.475
RAPE DO NOT HAVE A TIME LIMIT

04:14:17.542 --> 04:14:18.610
FOR PROSECUTION. SO WHILE OTHER

04:14:18.676 --> 04:14:21.212
CRIMES HAVE A SPECIFIC PERIOD

04:14:21.279 --> 04:14:24.716
WITHIN, THE LEGAL ACTION MUST BE

04:14:24.782 --> 04:14:26.751
TAKEN. I JUST WANT TO BE VERY

04:14:26.818 --> 04:14:29.020
CLEAR THAT THEY CAN STILL

04:14:29.087 --> 04:14:30.822
PROSECUTE. THERE'D BE NO LIMIT.

04:14:30.888 --> 04:14:32.023
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING? THEY

04:14:32.090 --> 04:14:33.725
CAN THEY CAN PROSECUTE ON THOSE

04:14:33.791 --> 04:14:35.660
ISSUES. THAT DOESN'T FALL WITHIN

04:14:35.727 --> 04:14:38.162
THE 60 TIME FRAME. I DO WANT TO

04:14:38.229 --> 04:14:39.697
STATE THAT, YOU KNOW, FROM THE

04:14:39.764 --> 04:14:41.633
VERY BEGINNING OF THIS BILL, WE

04:14:41.699 --> 04:14:43.201
KNEW THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD

04:14:43.267 --> 04:14:45.770
COME AT US HARD. I ALWAYS WANT

04:14:45.837 --> 04:14:48.172
TO BE VERY CLEAR. MY OFFICE HAS

04:14:48.239 --> 04:14:49.140
REACHED OUT FROM THE VERY

04:14:49.207 --> 04:14:51.476
BEGINNING TO ENGAGE WITH ALL OF

04:14:51.542 --> 04:14:52.744
OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES,

04:14:52.810 --> 04:14:54.646
FROM THE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION

04:14:54.712 --> 04:14:57.782
TO OUR CHIEF OF POLICE AND

04:14:57.849 --> 04:14:59.283
OTHERS WHO WERE IN OPPOSITION

04:14:59.350 --> 04:15:00.985
FROM OUR TRANSIT AGENCIES. WE'VE

04:15:01.052 --> 04:15:02.120
BEEN ABLE TO ADDRESS SOME OF

04:15:02.186 --> 04:15:04.155
THOSE ISSUES, AS YOU HEARD,

04:15:04.222 --> 04:15:05.923
THROUGH AMENDMENTS. BUT I WANT

04:15:05.990 --> 04:15:07.959
TO BE CLEAR THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT

04:15:08.026 --> 04:15:11.729
IS RESISTANT TO ANY OVERSIGHT

04:15:11.796 --> 04:15:13.931
REGARDING DATA RETENTION

04:15:13.998 --> 04:15:15.867
TIMELINES. IT WAS ASKED IN A

04:15:15.933 --> 04:15:17.201
PREVIOUS COMMITTEE, WHAT IS WHAT

04:15:17.268 --> 04:15:18.703
IS THE TIMELINE THEN FOR YOU

04:15:18.770 --> 04:15:21.539
THAT WOULD WORK? NO RESPONSE.

04:15:21.606 --> 04:15:23.274
AND SO I ASK YOU, YOU KNOW, I

04:15:23.341 --> 04:15:25.143
WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH

04:15:25.209 --> 04:15:26.310
OPPOSITION. THAT IS WHO I AM AS

04:15:26.377 --> 04:15:28.546
A LEGISLATOR. AND I THINK THAT

04:15:28.613 --> 04:15:30.481
ALL OF YOU, EVEN THOSE ON THE

04:15:30.548 --> 04:15:31.683
OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE, CAN

04:15:31.749 --> 04:15:33.518
VOUCH FOR THAT. I AM WILLING TO

04:15:33.584 --> 04:15:35.353
WORK WITH THOSE WHO HAVE A

04:15:35.420 --> 04:15:36.621
DIFFERENT OPINION AND

04:15:36.688 --> 04:15:38.022
PERSPECTIVE, AND I VALUE SOME OF

04:15:38.089 --> 04:15:40.291
THE OPINIONS THAT WERE MENTIONED

04:15:40.358 --> 04:15:43.528
TODAY, BECAUSE I'M HAPPY TO GO

04:15:43.594 --> 04:15:45.596
BACK AND CONTINUE TO ENGAGE. BUT

04:15:45.663 --> 04:15:47.031
WHEN YOU HAVE A PARTY THAT IS

04:15:47.098 --> 04:15:49.967
NOT WILLING TO START THOSE

04:15:50.034 --> 04:15:51.235
NEGOTIATIONS, WHERE DO WE WHAT

04:15:51.302 --> 04:15:54.272
DO WE DO AS LEGISLATORS? AGAIN,

04:15:54.338 --> 04:15:58.643
I WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN

04:15:58.710 --> 04:15:59.977
CONTINUE HAVING WE WILL HAVE

04:16:00.044 --> 04:16:03.281
ROBUST CONVERSATIONS AS WE HAVE

04:16:03.347 --> 04:16:05.583
THESE DISCUSSIONS OUTSIDE OF

04:16:05.650 --> 04:16:08.019
THIS COMMITTEE TODAY. BUT JUST

04:16:08.086 --> 04:16:10.154
IN A FEW YEARS AGO, WE HAD A

04:16:10.221 --> 04:16:11.889
COLLEAGUE IN THE SENATE WHO

04:16:11.956 --> 04:16:14.425
INTRODUCED THIS BILL, A 24 HOUR

04:16:14.492 --> 04:16:18.229
RETENTION LIMIT THAT WAS PUSHED

04:16:18.296 --> 04:16:21.499
OFF THE TABLE. AND THEN WE HAD A

04:16:21.566 --> 04:16:23.735
30 DAY RETENTION LIMIT THAT WAS

04:16:23.801 --> 04:16:25.636
PUSHED OFF THE TABLE. NOW WE

04:16:25.703 --> 04:16:28.139
HAVE A 60 DAY RETENTION LIMIT.

04:16:28.206 --> 04:16:32.043
SO WHERE DO WE LAND? AND IT'S A

04:16:32.110 --> 04:16:33.611
QUESTION THAT I POSED TODAY ON

04:16:33.678 --> 04:16:36.714
THAT ISSUE. BUT ASIDE FROM THE

04:16:36.781 --> 04:16:38.216
RETENTION LIMIT IT'S THE

04:16:38.282 --> 04:16:40.017
SAFEGUARDS. IT'S THE TRAINING

04:16:40.084 --> 04:16:41.853
THAT WE'RE PUTTING IN PLACE FOR

04:16:41.919 --> 04:16:44.689
THE STAFF THAT ACTUALLY ACCESS

04:16:44.756 --> 04:16:46.958
ALPR DATA. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED

04:16:47.024 --> 04:16:49.093
TO DO IS LOOK AT THE SAFEGUARDS

04:16:49.160 --> 04:16:51.629
ON THE TRAINING MECHANISMS FOR

04:16:51.696 --> 04:16:56.567
ALL OF THE APRIL ALPR USERS. AND

04:16:56.634 --> 04:16:59.737
LASTLY, I WILL JUST ASK EACH OF

04:16:59.804 --> 04:17:05.543
US. IS IT THE EXPECTATION OF

04:17:05.610 --> 04:17:08.646
PRIVACY TO HAVE YOUR DATA USED

04:17:08.713 --> 04:17:12.683
TO BE STOCKED? THAT IS THE DAY

04:17:12.750 --> 04:17:16.020
IN WHICH WE ARE LIVING IN, AND I

04:17:16.087 --> 04:17:17.555
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

04:17:17.622 --> 04:17:19.957
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

04:17:20.024 --> 04:17:23.261
CALL THE ROLL, PLEASE. OH, WE

04:17:23.327 --> 04:17:26.130
NEED A SECOND, SECOND, SECOND.

04:17:26.197 --> 04:17:30.802
THANK YOU. ITEM NUMBER FIVE, SB

04:17:30.868 --> 04:17:33.638

04:17:33.704 --> 04:17:35.873
MOTION IS DO PASS, AS AMENDED,

384 ADDRESSES DIGITAL COLLUSION

04:18:55.853 --> 04:18:57.555
BY PLACING RESPONSIBILITY ON

04:18:57.622 --> 04:18:58.556
SELLERS TO ENSURE THEY ARE NOT

04:18:58.623 --> 04:19:00.258
USING PRICE SETTING SOFTWARE,

04:19:00.324 --> 04:19:02.593
AND ON SOFTWARE CREATORS TO

04:19:02.660 --> 04:19:04.161
ENSURE THEY ARE NOT SELLING,

04:19:04.228 --> 04:19:06.464
PRICE FIXING OR PRICE SETTING

04:19:06.530 --> 04:19:07.965
SOFTWARE. WE ARE SEEING MORE

04:19:08.032 --> 04:19:09.367
WIDESPREAD USE OF SOFTWARE THAT

04:19:09.433 --> 04:19:10.935
COLLECTS COMPETITIVELY SENSITIVE

04:19:11.002 --> 04:19:12.570
DATA FROM COMPETITORS AND

04:19:12.637 --> 04:19:14.005
GENERATES PRICING

04:19:14.071 --> 04:19:15.106
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INDIVIDUAL

04:19:15.172 --> 04:19:16.874
BUSINESSES. BASED ON THE DATA

04:19:16.941 --> 04:19:19.110
SHARED BY COMPETITORS. WE ALL

04:19:19.176 --> 04:19:22.079
AGREE WHEN YOU KNOW CONFIDENTIAL

04:19:22.146 --> 04:19:23.681
AND NONPUBLIC DATA IS SHARED

04:19:23.748 --> 04:19:25.950
AMONGST COMPETITORS IN ANY

04:19:26.017 --> 04:19:28.019
FASHION, IT IS COLLUSION.

04:19:28.085 --> 04:19:29.620
HOWEVER, BY THE TIME THESE

04:19:29.687 --> 04:19:30.955
ILLEGAL PRACTICES ARE

04:19:31.022 --> 04:19:32.089
DISCOVERED, THE MARKET

04:19:32.156 --> 04:19:33.858
MANIPULATIONS HAVE ALREADY

04:19:33.925 --> 04:19:35.026
OCCURRED AND CONSUMERS HAVE

04:19:35.092 --> 04:19:36.360
ALREADY SUFFERED THE

04:19:36.427 --> 04:19:38.062
CONSEQUENCES. SB 384 IS AN

04:19:38.129 --> 04:19:39.964
INTERVENING MEASURE TO PREVENT

04:19:40.031 --> 04:19:41.799
MARKETPLACE MANIPULATIONS IN THE

04:19:41.866 --> 04:19:43.634
FIRST PLACE, BY REQUIRING

04:19:43.701 --> 04:19:44.936
SELLERS TO DO GREAT DUE

04:19:45.002 --> 04:19:46.270
DILIGENCE ON THE SOFTWARE THEY

04:19:46.337 --> 04:19:47.772
ARE USING, AND PREVENTING

04:19:47.838 --> 04:19:48.706
SOFTWARE CREATORS FROM SELLING

04:19:48.773 --> 04:19:50.107
SUCH SOFTWARE IN THE FIRST

04:19:50.174 --> 04:19:51.442
PLACE. I FEEL WE HAVE

04:19:51.509 --> 04:19:52.510
THOUGHTFULLY ADDRESSED THE

04:19:52.576 --> 04:19:53.110

OPPOSITION. I'D LIKE TO

04:19:58.182 --> 04:19:59.617
INTRODUCE MY FIRST WITNESS,

TRACY ROSENBERG OF OAKLAND.

04:20:00.785 --> 04:20:04.155
PRIVACY. GOOD AFTERNOON, VICE

04:20:04.221 --> 04:20:05.589
CHAIR AND MEMBERS TRACY

04:20:05.656 --> 04:20:07.458
ROSENBERG, OAKLAND PRIVACY WE

04:20:07.525 --> 04:20:09.493
ARE A STATEWIDE COALITION THAT

04:20:09.560 --> 04:20:10.594
ADVOCATES FOR SAFEGUARDS AND

04:20:10.661 --> 04:20:11.529
GUARDRAILS IN THE INTEREST OF

PRIVACY PROTECTIONS, CIVIL

04:20:13.998 --> 04:20:15.866
RIGHTS, AND COMMUNITY CONSENT.

04:20:15.933 --> 04:20:17.702
SB 384 IS ONE OF MANY BILLS THIS

04:20:17.768 --> 04:20:19.503
YEAR FOCUSED ON ALGORITHMIC

04:20:19.570 --> 04:20:20.705
PRICING FORMULAS AND THEIR

04:20:20.771 --> 04:20:24.041
HARMFUL IMPACTS ON AFFORDABILITY

04:20:24.108 --> 04:20:25.309
FOR CONSUMERS AND ON MARKET

04:20:25.376 --> 04:20:27.078
COMPETITION. SB 384 SEEKS TO

04:20:27.144 --> 04:20:28.980
CLEARLY DEFINE THE PRICE FIXING

04:20:29.046 --> 04:20:30.781
IS STILL PRICE FIXING IF A

04:20:30.848 --> 04:20:32.850
MACHINE DOES IT, AND THAT

04:20:32.917 --> 04:20:33.985
INDIVIDUAL SELLERS CAN BE SAID

04:20:34.051 --> 04:20:35.553
TO ENGAGE IN PRICE FIXING. IF

04:20:35.619 --> 04:20:37.121
THE PRICING STRATEGY IS

04:20:37.188 --> 04:20:38.489
DETERMINED BY AN ALGORITHMIC

04:20:38.556 --> 04:20:40.358
PROCESS THAT CONTAINS NONPUBLIC

04:20:40.424 --> 04:20:43.995
DATA FROM TWO OR MORE SELLERS,

04:20:44.061 --> 04:20:46.597
TO DEVELOP THAT PRICE FIXING

04:20:46.664 --> 04:20:47.999
STRATEGY, WE SUPPORT THIS AS THE

04:20:48.065 --> 04:20:50.201
ADAPTATION OF CLASSIC ANTITRUST

04:20:50.267 --> 04:20:52.703
LAW TO THE SAME OLD PRICE FIXING

04:20:52.770 --> 04:20:54.672
BEHAVIOR IN NEW GUISES AND

04:20:54.739 --> 04:20:58.709
FORMATS DUE TO TECHNOLOGICAL.

04:20:58.776 --> 04:21:00.277
INNOVATION AND THE INCREASING

04:21:00.344 --> 04:21:02.079
CAPACITY OF ARTIFICIAL

04:21:02.146 --> 04:21:03.447
INTELLIGENCE PROGRAMING,

04:21:03.514 --> 04:21:05.349
CONSUMERS ARE ENTITLED TO THE

04:21:05.416 --> 04:21:06.784
BENEFITS OF MARKETPLACE

04:21:06.851 --> 04:21:08.853
COMPETITION BETWEEN VARIOUS

04:21:08.919 --> 04:21:10.354
SELLERS, WHICH IS THE PRIMARY

04:21:10.421 --> 04:21:12.923
LEVER FOR DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON

04:21:12.990 --> 04:21:14.525
PRICES IN MARKET BASED

04:21:14.592 --> 04:21:16.861
CAPITALISM. WHEN SELLERS COLLUDE

04:21:16.927 --> 04:21:18.262
SECRETIVELY TO KEEP PRICES

04:21:18.329 --> 04:21:19.830
ARTIFICIALLY HIGH, ARTIFICIALLY

04:21:19.897 --> 04:21:21.465
HIGH, THEY CONSUMERS LOSE THEIR

04:21:21.532 --> 04:21:23.601
STRONGEST WEAPON, WHICH IS THE

04:21:23.667 --> 04:21:26.470
ABILITY TO WALK FROM ONE SELLER

04:21:26.537 --> 04:21:28.139
TO ANOTHER. SHOULD ONE

04:21:28.205 --> 04:21:29.407
PARTICULAR SELLER RAISE THEIR

04:21:29.473 --> 04:21:31.942
PRICE TOO HIGH. SO THANK YOU.

04:21:32.009 --> 04:21:34.612
AND WE ASK FOR YOUR VOTE ON SB

04:21:34.678 --> 04:21:35.579

PRINCIPAL WITNESS IF YOU'D LIKE

04:22:04.875 --> 04:22:10.181
TO COME FORWARD. YOU'VE BEEN

04:22:10.247 --> 04:22:17.855
BUSY TODAY. JUST A LITTLE. THANK

04:22:17.922 --> 04:22:19.156
YOU, MADAM VICE CHAIR AND

04:22:19.223 --> 04:22:21.292
MEMBERS, ON BEHALF OF CAL

04:22:21.358 --> 04:22:23.694
CHAMBER IN OPPOSITION TO SB 384

04:22:23.761 --> 04:22:25.162
AS A COST DRIVER, THOUGH, WE DO

04:22:25.229 --> 04:22:27.064
WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND HER

04:22:27.131 --> 04:22:28.432
STAFF AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF

04:22:28.499 --> 04:22:30.201
FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL.

04:22:30.267 --> 04:22:31.202
THUS FAR, I PRICING TOOLS ARE

04:22:31.268 --> 04:22:33.137
WIDELY USED TO HELP KEEP PRICE

04:22:33.204 --> 04:22:35.005
PRICES COMPETITIVE AND LOWER FOR

04:22:35.072 --> 04:22:36.240
CONSUMERS ACROSS RETAIL,

04:22:36.307 --> 04:22:37.708
BANKING, HOSPITALITY, TICKETING,

04:22:37.775 --> 04:22:39.510
RIDE SHARING AND MORE. OUR CORE

04:22:39.577 --> 04:22:41.212
CONCERN WITH SB 384 AND SIMILAR

04:22:41.278 --> 04:22:42.480
PRICING ALGORITHM BILLS IS THAT

04:22:42.546 --> 04:22:43.881
THEY ASSUME THAT ALL PRICING

04:22:43.948 --> 04:22:45.316
ALGORITHMS ARE INHERENTLY

04:22:45.382 --> 04:22:46.851
SUSPECT OR EQUIVALENT TO PRICE

04:22:46.917 --> 04:22:48.252
FIXING, WHICH IS SIMPLY NOT THE

04:22:48.319 --> 04:22:50.087
CASE. PRICE COLLUSION IS ALREADY

04:22:50.154 --> 04:22:51.355
ILLEGAL UNDER FEDERAL AND STATE

04:22:51.422 --> 04:22:52.656
LAW, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER

04:22:52.723 --> 04:22:53.791
TECHNOLOGY IS INVOLVED. AND I

04:22:53.858 --> 04:22:56.260
SAY THIS AS A REMINDER THAT THE

04:22:56.327 --> 04:22:57.228
LACK OF A BILL ON THIS ISSUE

04:22:57.294 --> 04:22:59.296
DOES NOT LEAVE A VACUUM IN THE

04:22:59.363 --> 04:23:01.232
LAW. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

04:23:01.298 --> 04:23:02.032
STATE THAT WE VERY MUCH

04:23:02.099 --> 04:23:03.167
APPRECIATE, AGAIN, THE

04:23:03.234 --> 04:23:04.869
AMENDMENTS TO NARROW AND CLARIFY

04:23:04.935 --> 04:23:06.103
THE DEFINITION OF NONPUBLIC

04:23:06.170 --> 04:23:06.637
DATA, WHICH I BELIEVE THE

04:23:06.704 --> 04:23:08.139
COMMITTEE IS ALSO PLAYED AN

04:23:08.205 --> 04:23:09.440
INSTRUMENTAL PART IN. AND WE DO

04:23:09.507 --> 04:23:10.941
THANK YOU FOR I THINK THAT IS

04:23:11.008 --> 04:23:12.243
VERY HELPFUL. THAT'S BEEN ONE OF

04:23:12.309 --> 04:23:13.878
THE KEY ISSUES WITH THIS BILL

04:23:13.944 --> 04:23:16.480
FROM THE GET GO. SO WE'VE

04:23:16.547 --> 04:23:17.148
ACTUALLY MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS

04:23:17.214 --> 04:23:19.150
ON THAT. WE THINK THE AUTHOR, IT

04:23:19.216 --> 04:23:20.151
WOULD BE HELPFUL, I THINK FROM

04:23:20.217 --> 04:23:21.285
OUR PERSPECTIVE, TO JUST

04:23:21.352 --> 04:23:22.453
EXPRESSLY MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

04:23:22.520 --> 04:23:24.088
EXCLUDING PUBLICLY AVAILABLE

04:23:24.155 --> 04:23:24.655
INFORMATION AS WELL AS WE

04:23:24.722 --> 04:23:25.689
CONTINUE GATHERING FEEDBACK FROM

04:23:25.756 --> 04:23:27.858
OUR MEMBERS ON THE AMENDED BILL,

04:23:27.925 --> 04:23:29.326
WE DO SEE TWO KIND OF ISSUES WE

04:23:29.393 --> 04:23:31.295
DO WANT TO HIT ON THAT WOULD

04:23:31.362 --> 04:23:32.897
CONTINUE TO CHILL PRICE

04:23:32.963 --> 04:23:34.231
COMPETITION FIRST, AS WAS REALLY

04:23:34.298 --> 04:23:35.332
WELL EXPRESSED BY MY COLLEAGUE

04:23:35.399 --> 04:23:37.301
FROM CAA EARLIER TODAY. THIS

04:23:37.368 --> 04:23:38.469
SHOULD HAVE KNOWN STANDARD IN

04:23:38.536 --> 04:23:40.037
THE BILL IS VAGUE AND

04:23:40.104 --> 04:23:41.205
SUBJECTIVE, AND WE BELIEVE THAT

04:23:41.272 --> 04:23:42.573
THE BILL SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON

04:23:42.640 --> 04:23:44.375
WHAT BUSINESSES KNOW WHEN THEY

04:23:44.441 --> 04:23:45.276
USE THESE TOOLS. THE ALLEGATIONS

04:23:45.342 --> 04:23:46.544
ARE SERIOUS AND THEY ARE, AND

04:23:46.610 --> 04:23:49.146
THE PENALTIES ARE QUITE HIGH.

04:23:49.213 --> 04:23:51.015
AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

04:23:51.081 --> 04:23:52.917
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WHAT

04:23:52.983 --> 04:23:53.517
BUSINESSES ACTUALLY KNOW, AND

04:23:53.584 --> 04:23:54.919
NOT KIND OF THE MONDAY MORNING

04:23:54.985 --> 04:23:56.187
QUARTERBACKING OF WHAT THEY

04:23:56.253 --> 04:23:57.121
SHOULD HAVE KNOWN. ONCE WE HAVE

04:23:57.188 --> 04:23:58.556
ALL THE FACTS IN PLACE. SECOND,

04:23:58.622 --> 04:24:00.591
THE DEFINITION OF PRICE SETTING

04:24:00.658 --> 04:24:01.759
ALGORITHMS CONTINUES TO BE

04:24:01.825 --> 04:24:03.427
EXTREMELY BROAD. IT CAPTURES

04:24:03.494 --> 04:24:04.929
VIRTUALLY ALL SOFTWARE SYSTEMS

04:24:04.995 --> 04:24:06.797
OR PROCESSES THAT PROCESS

04:24:06.864 --> 04:24:08.432
NONPUBLIC DATA FOR ANY PRICING

04:24:08.499 --> 04:24:09.700
STRATEGY, POTENTIALLY EVEN

04:24:09.767 --> 04:24:10.968
SEARCH ENGINES OR TOOLS THAT

04:24:11.035 --> 04:24:12.469
PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS,

04:24:12.536 --> 04:24:13.571
COMPARISONS, BID STRATEGIES EVEN

04:24:13.637 --> 04:24:15.072
IF THEY DON'T SET THE FINAL

04:24:15.139 --> 04:24:16.840
PRICE. AGAIN, WE DO APPRECIATE

04:24:16.907 --> 04:24:18.242
THE DIRECTION THAT'S BEEN TAKEN.

04:24:18.309 --> 04:24:19.310
WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH

04:24:19.376 --> 04:24:21.412
THE AUTHOR. I WILL SAY ASSEMBLY

04:24:21.478 --> 04:24:22.880
MEMBER IRWIN MENTIONED THIS

04:24:22.947 --> 04:24:23.948
EARLIER. WE WOULD HAVE HOPED

04:24:24.014 --> 04:24:26.083
THAT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN MAYBE

04:24:26.150 --> 04:24:26.951
FEWER BILLS ON THIS ONE ISSUE,

04:24:27.017 --> 04:24:28.252
SO WE COULD CONCENTRATE ON

04:24:28.319 --> 04:24:31.989
PROVIDING OUR AMENDMENTS. BUT WE,

04:24:32.056 --> 04:24:34.024
WE ARE WHERE WE ARE AND WE

04:24:34.091 --> 04:24:35.226
CONTINUE TO LOOK FORWARD TO

04:24:35.292 --> 04:24:36.393
WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. THANK

04:24:36.460 --> 04:24:38.295

HONESTLY LOVE TO COLLUDE WITH

YOU AND THE OTHER AUTHORS TO

04:24:50.441 --> 04:24:52.209
FIGURE OUT HOW WE COULD NARROW

04:24:52.276 --> 04:24:54.111
THESE BILLS. SO WE DON'T HAVE

04:24:54.178 --> 04:24:55.179
FIVE DIFFERENT CODE SECTIONS

04:24:55.246 --> 04:24:56.547

04:25:51.468 --> 04:25:52.436
FURTHER OPPOSITION, WE'LL BRING

04:25:52.503 --> 04:25:57.308
IT BACK TO THE DÍAS.

04:25:57.374 --> 04:26:00.778
ASSEMBLYMEMBER KENNER. IT'S LIKE

04:26:00.844 --> 04:26:02.680
EVERYBODY'S MOVED TO THE LEFT,

04:26:02.746 --> 04:26:06.684
INCLUDING MY REPUBLICANS. I JUST

04:26:06.750 --> 04:26:09.386
WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

04:26:09.453 --> 04:26:11.021
COMPETITION. THE FOUNDATION OF A

04:26:11.088 --> 04:26:13.791
FREE MARKET IS COMPETITION. AND

04:26:13.857 --> 04:26:18.529
WHEN YOU USE THESE ALGORITHMS TO

04:26:18.595 --> 04:26:22.466
SET PRICES, IT IT'S ALMOST LIKE

04:26:22.533 --> 04:26:24.401
PRICE FIXING. BUT BACK IN THE

04:26:24.468 --> 04:26:25.436
DAY, BEFORE WE HAD COMPUTERS,

04:26:25.502 --> 04:26:27.104
PRICE FIXING, THEY WOULD HAVE TO

04:26:27.171 --> 04:26:29.306
GO AND GO IN THE BACK ROOMS AND

04:26:29.373 --> 04:26:30.074
MEET AND DO THESE KIND OF

04:26:30.140 --> 04:26:32.543
THINGS. NOW THEY COULD JUST KIND

04:26:32.609 --> 04:26:33.210
OF COLLUDE WITH EACH OTHER OVER

04:26:33.277 --> 04:26:35.279
THE INTERNET. SO I JUST WANT TO

04:26:35.346 --> 04:26:37.147
KNOW WHAT WHAT IS THE WHAT, HOW,

04:26:37.214 --> 04:26:38.682
WHO DID THESE ALGORITHMS

04:26:38.749 --> 04:26:40.884
ACTUALLY HELP? BESIDES THE

04:26:40.951 --> 04:26:42.720
COMPANIES? I THINK IT DOES HELP

04:26:42.786 --> 04:26:44.154
THE CONSUMER AS WELL. IT HELPS

04:26:44.221 --> 04:26:46.190
US DO DYNAMIC PRICING SO YOU CAN

04:26:46.256 --> 04:26:47.358
SEE MUCH MORE QUICKLY IF YOU

04:26:47.424 --> 04:26:48.826
WANT TO, FOR EXAMPLE, UNDERCUT

04:26:48.892 --> 04:26:50.194
THE PRICES OF YOUR COMPETITORS.

04:26:50.260 --> 04:26:52.096
YOU CAN SEE MUCH MORE QUICKLY

04:26:52.162 --> 04:26:53.797
KIND OF WHAT THE PRICES ARE AND

04:26:53.864 --> 04:26:55.632
UNDER UNDERCUT THOSE PRICES FOR

04:26:55.699 --> 04:26:57.034
PRICE MATCHING AND THINGS LIKE

04:26:57.101 --> 04:26:58.435
THAT. IT DOES HELP WITH THOSE

04:26:58.502 --> 04:27:00.671
TYPES OF POLICIES. I HEAR YOUR

04:27:00.738 --> 04:27:02.072
POINT AND I DON'T WE DON'T

04:27:02.139 --> 04:27:03.874
DISAGREE WITH YOU. I THINK FROM

04:27:03.941 --> 04:27:04.641
OUR PERSPECTIVE, USING

04:27:04.708 --> 04:27:05.776
TECHNOLOGY OR NOT USING

04:27:05.843 --> 04:27:06.310
TECHNOLOGY DOESN'T CHANGE

04:27:06.377 --> 04:27:08.479
WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE VIOLATED

04:27:08.545 --> 04:27:09.446
THE LAW. SO WE'RE NOT DISPUTING

04:27:09.513 --> 04:27:11.582
THAT AT ALL. I THINK WHAT WE'RE

04:27:11.648 --> 04:27:13.417
TRYING TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT

04:27:13.484 --> 04:27:14.818
WE ARE NOT CHANGING

04:27:14.885 --> 04:27:16.553
FUNDAMENTALLY THE WHAT IS

04:27:16.620 --> 04:27:17.888
CONSIDERED COLLUSION, WHAT IS

04:27:17.955 --> 04:27:20.257
CONSIDERED TO BE A VIOLATION OF

04:27:20.324 --> 04:27:22.659
THE LAW JUST BY NATURE OF USING

04:27:22.726 --> 04:27:24.027
THE TECHNOLOGY. SO IF YOU USE

04:27:24.094 --> 04:27:25.329
THE CALCULATOR, IT DOESN'T MAKE

04:27:25.396 --> 04:27:26.830
IT CHEATING. ARE YOU CHEATING OR

04:27:26.897 --> 04:27:28.499
DETECT THOUGH? YES. RIGHT. IT'S

04:27:28.565 --> 04:27:30.134
HARDER TO DETECT IF THAT'S WHAT

04:27:30.200 --> 04:27:32.970
YOU GUYS ARE DOING. BUT IF I'M

04:27:33.036 --> 04:27:35.105
TRYING TO GET A PROFIT AND I

04:27:35.172 --> 04:27:37.274
DON'T WANT TO, I WANT TO KEEP MY

04:27:37.341 --> 04:27:38.142
PROFITS HIGH AND I SEE WHAT

04:27:38.208 --> 04:27:40.544
OTHER PEOPLE ARE CHARGING AND I

04:27:40.611 --> 04:27:41.612
COULD SEE IT CLEARLY WITH THESE

04:27:41.678 --> 04:27:42.646
ALGORITHMS. I DON'T KNOW IF

04:27:42.713 --> 04:27:44.481
THAT'S HELPING THE CONSUMER, AND

04:27:44.548 --> 04:27:45.749
I DON'T KNOW IF THE COMPANIES

04:27:45.816 --> 04:27:47.050
ARE ACTUALLY SAYING, OKAY, NOW

04:27:47.117 --> 04:27:48.552
I'M GOING TO UNDERCUT AND BRING

04:27:48.619 --> 04:27:50.187
THE BRING THE PRICES DOWN. BUT

04:27:50.254 --> 04:27:51.822
IT IS VERY IT'S HARDER TO

04:27:51.889 --> 04:27:53.891
DETECT. SO WE'D LOVE TO SEE YOU

04:27:53.957 --> 04:27:56.360
GUYS WORK ON HOW HOW WE'RE GOING

04:27:56.427 --> 04:27:58.195
TO DETECT THAT. AND IF YOU GUYS

04:27:58.262 --> 04:28:00.130
IF THIS IS REALLY GOOD FOR THE

04:28:00.197 --> 04:28:01.165
CONSUMER. AND WITH THAT I'LL BE

04:28:01.231 --> 04:28:02.933
SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. AND I

04:28:03.000 --> 04:28:04.768
WOULD ARGUE THAT IF YOU USE THE

04:28:04.835 --> 04:28:06.870
CALCULATOR AND EVERY STORE, THE

04:28:06.937 --> 04:28:08.038
BUTTON LEADS TO THE SAME PRICE

04:28:08.105 --> 04:28:09.606
AND YOU'RE ALL USING THE SAME

04:28:09.673 --> 04:28:11.408
CALCULATOR. THAT IS COLLUSION.

04:28:11.475 --> 04:28:12.509
SO IT KIND OF DEPENDS ON HOW THE

04:28:12.576 --> 04:28:16.246
CALCULATOR IS BUILT. SO IT'S

04:28:16.313 --> 04:28:18.048
BEEN A VERY LONG WEEK. I THINK

04:28:18.115 --> 04:28:20.884
WE CAN ALL ATTEST TO IT. BUT I

04:28:20.951 --> 04:28:22.219
KIND OF FEEL LIKE WE HAVE DEJA

04:28:22.286 --> 04:28:23.454
VU SOMETIMES. LIKE I'M SURE

04:28:23.520 --> 04:28:24.488
YOU'RE TALKING POINTS FOR THIS.

04:28:24.555 --> 04:28:26.990
SO MY MAIN PLEA TO ALL OF THE

04:28:27.057 --> 04:28:28.425
AUTHORS RUNNING BILLS LIKE THIS

04:28:28.492 --> 04:28:30.093
IS TO ALL JUST GET IN THE SAME

04:28:30.160 --> 04:28:31.662
ROOM, AND LET'S PUT ONE COHESIVE

04:28:31.728 --> 04:28:33.897
BILL IN FRONT OF THE GOVERNOR

04:28:33.964 --> 04:28:36.066
THAT I THINK THAT THE PLAYERS

04:28:36.133 --> 04:28:37.334
INVOLVED ARE WILLING TO CONCEDE

04:28:37.401 --> 04:28:39.236
ON A LOT OF THINGS TO GET TO

04:28:39.303 --> 04:28:40.971
WHAT YOUR CONCERNS ARE AND YOUR

04:28:41.038 --> 04:28:42.873
CONCERNS ARE. BUT MY PLEA IS

04:28:42.940 --> 04:28:44.808
SIMILAR TO MISS IRWIN'S OF LET'S

04:28:44.875 --> 04:28:46.810
ALL GET IN THE SAME ROOM AND

04:28:46.877 --> 04:28:47.845
HAVE ONE REALLY GREAT BILL, AND

04:28:47.911 --> 04:28:49.713
I'LL BE VERY CAREFUL HOW I USE

04:28:49.780 --> 04:28:51.782
MY WORDS AND NOT CALL IT ANOTHER

04:28:51.849 --> 04:28:52.983
WORD THAT'S TRIGGERING. BUT

04:28:53.050 --> 04:28:55.185
ANYWAY, I WON'T BE ABLE TO

04:28:55.252 --> 04:28:56.854
SUPPORT TODAY. BUT THAT'S MY ASK

04:28:56.920 --> 04:28:59.089
I GUESS. AND I MIGHT BE ABLE TO

04:28:59.156 --> 04:29:00.057
SUPPORT SOMETHING ON THE FLOOR

04:29:00.123 --> 04:29:02.259
IF WE COULD GET MULTIPLE AUTHORS

04:29:02.326 --> 04:29:03.260
IN THE SAME ROOM. AND I'LL BE

04:29:03.327 --> 04:29:05.162
SAYING THE SAME THING TO MISS

04:29:05.229 --> 04:29:06.430
SENATOR HURTADO WHEN SHE'S IN

04:29:06.497 --> 04:29:08.665
NEXT. BUT THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR

04:29:08.732 --> 04:29:09.733
HARD WORK ON THIS, AND LOOK

04:29:09.800 --> 04:29:11.301
FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT YOU GUYS

04:29:11.368 --> 04:29:12.269
GET PUT TOGETHER BEFORE THE

04:29:12.336 --> 04:29:14.438
ASSEMBLY FLOOR. THANK YOU. I DO

04:29:14.505 --> 04:29:16.840
JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT, YOU

04:29:16.907 --> 04:29:19.209
KNOW, THE THREE BILLS ARE SENATE

04:29:19.276 --> 04:29:22.412
BILLS FIRST AND FOREMOST. AND WE

04:29:22.479 --> 04:29:23.914
HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE OTHER

04:29:23.981 --> 04:29:26.383
AUTHORS AS WELL AS THE COMMITTEE

04:29:26.450 --> 04:29:27.551
STAFF TO KIND OF JUST SEE WHERE

04:29:27.618 --> 04:29:31.421
WE'RE GOING TO GO WITH THIS. AND

04:29:31.488 --> 04:29:33.257
I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT OUR

04:29:33.323 --> 04:29:34.691
BILL ALSO OFFERS AN AFFIRMATIVE

04:29:34.758 --> 04:29:36.593
DEFENSE TO THOSE WHO DID THEIR

04:29:36.660 --> 04:29:37.794
DUE DILIGENCE BEFORE CHOOSING A

04:29:37.861 --> 04:29:39.696
SPECIFIC SOFTWARE THAT IS LATER

04:29:39.763 --> 04:29:41.999
FOUND IN VIOLATION. AND I THINK

04:29:42.065 --> 04:29:44.034
THAT WITH YOUR VOTE, YOU CAN

04:29:44.101 --> 04:29:46.637
CHOOSE THE BILL THAT COULD GO IN

04:29:46.703 --> 04:29:49.006
FRONT OF THE GOVERNOR'S DESK.

04:29:49.072 --> 04:29:50.374
AND I THINK THAT THIS IS THE

04:29:50.440 --> 04:29:52.042
RIGHT BILL. YOU KNOW, WE ARE

04:29:52.109 --> 04:29:55.879
VERY CLEAR ABOUT THE DATA BEING

04:29:55.946 --> 04:29:58.715
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE, DATA BEING

04:29:58.782 --> 04:29:59.883
EXCLUDED. AND IT'S THE PRIVATE

04:29:59.950 --> 04:30:01.752
DATA. AND WE'RE TRYING TO WORK

04:30:01.818 --> 04:30:03.787
WITH THE OPPOSITION AS MUCH AS

04:30:03.854 --> 04:30:05.289
POSSIBLE TO REALLY KIND OF

04:30:05.355 --> 04:30:06.323
ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS.

04:30:06.390 --> 04:30:07.724
BUT I THINK TO THE

04:30:07.791 --> 04:30:10.360
ASSEMBLYMEMBERS POINT, THE

04:30:10.427 --> 04:30:12.162
REALITY IS THAT, YOU KNOW, IT

04:30:12.229 --> 04:30:13.730
WAS STATED EVEN BY OPPOSITION,

04:30:13.797 --> 04:30:15.632
DYNAMIC PRICING IS ACTUALLY VERY

04:30:15.699 --> 04:30:17.200
PROBLEMATIC TO CONSUMERS. AND I

04:30:17.267 --> 04:30:18.535
TRULY, WHOLEHEARTEDLY BELIEVE

04:30:18.602 --> 04:30:19.870
THAT. YES, YOU COULD SAY, HEY,

04:30:19.937 --> 04:30:22.606
WE CAN DO A PRICE MATCH AND MUCH

04:30:22.673 --> 04:30:24.374
MORE, BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT

04:30:24.441 --> 04:30:27.744
PEOPLE WHO ARE BUSINESS OWNERS

04:30:27.811 --> 04:30:29.813
ARE LOOKING FOR THAT PROFIT. AND

04:30:29.880 --> 04:30:31.982
WHAT'S THE REALITY IS THAT WHEN

04:30:32.049 --> 04:30:33.984
YOU SEE A LOT OF INFORMATION, A

04:30:34.051 --> 04:30:35.686
LOT OF INFORMATION IS ALREADY

04:30:35.752 --> 04:30:36.587
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. IT'S ALREADY

04:30:36.653 --> 04:30:37.621
VERY OBVIOUS WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING

04:30:37.688 --> 04:30:40.057
AT ONLINE SEARCHING AND SAYING,

04:30:40.123 --> 04:30:41.925
HEY, HOW SHOULD I PUT THE PRICE

04:30:41.992 --> 04:30:45.195
OF GOODS AT THIS, THIS LEVEL?

04:30:45.262 --> 04:30:47.664
BUT A DYNAMIC PRICING AND THESE

04:30:47.731 --> 04:30:49.099
ALGORITHMS ARE ALSO WE HAVE

04:30:49.166 --> 04:30:50.901
SEVERAL BILLS IN THIS SPACE. I

04:30:50.968 --> 04:30:52.836
DID COME FROM A BACKGROUND IN

04:30:52.903 --> 04:30:53.804
TECHNOLOGY. I DO REPRESENT

04:30:53.870 --> 04:30:55.839
SILICON VALLEY. THEY ALSO LOOK

04:30:55.906 --> 04:30:58.342
AT YOUR PHONE. SO AND I'M SURE

04:30:58.408 --> 04:30:58.976
YOU'VE EXPERIENCED THIS, IF YOU

04:30:59.042 --> 04:31:01.211
HAVE 10% BATTERY LIFE AND YOU'RE

04:31:01.278 --> 04:31:04.281
TRYING TO GET A RIDE HAILING

04:31:04.348 --> 04:31:06.116
SERVICE, THEY WILL GIVE YOU A

04:31:06.183 --> 04:31:07.918
DYNAMIC PRICE THAT IS MORE THAN

04:31:07.985 --> 04:31:10.253
WHAT YOU WOULD NORMALLY PAY FOR,

04:31:10.320 --> 04:31:11.088
BECAUSE THEY KNOW YOU'RE

04:31:11.154 --> 04:31:12.222
DESPERATE BECAUSE YOUR PHONE'S

04:31:12.289 --> 04:31:14.358
ABOUT TO DIE, RIGHT? SO THAT'S

04:31:14.424 --> 04:31:15.559
DYNAMIC PRICING AS WELL. IT'S

04:31:15.626 --> 04:31:17.527
NOT JUST, HEY, YOU GET A COUPON

04:31:17.594 --> 04:31:19.096
AND WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU THE

04:31:19.162 --> 04:31:20.330
CHEAPEST PRICE BECAUSE THAT'S

04:31:20.397 --> 04:31:22.332
NOT WHAT THEY'RE INTERESTED IN.

04:31:22.399 --> 04:31:23.200
AT THE END OF THE DAY, BUSINESS

04:31:23.266 --> 04:31:25.535
IS FOR PROFIT. AND SO WE AS

04:31:25.602 --> 04:31:26.436
POLICY MAKERS ARE TRULY IN THE

04:31:26.503 --> 04:31:28.538
BUSINESS OF PROTECTING OUR 40

04:31:28.605 --> 04:31:30.307
MILLION CALIFORNIANS. AND THAT'S

04:31:30.374 --> 04:31:32.009
WHAT THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS,

04:31:32.075 --> 04:31:35.012
AS WELL AS ANY, PRETTY MUCH ANY

04:31:35.078 --> 04:31:35.612
BILL I CARRY. BUT SO I THINK

04:31:35.679 --> 04:31:38.682
THAT THIS IS A GOOD BILL TO GET

04:31:38.749 --> 04:31:39.650
YOUR VOTE EVENTUALLY. SO THANK

04:31:39.716 --> 04:31:42.419
YOU. YEAH, YEAH. MADAM VICE

04:31:42.486 --> 04:31:48.659
CHAIR, I CAN'T HELP MYSELF

04:31:48.725 --> 04:31:49.593
BECAUSE THIS IS THE THIRD BILL.

04:31:49.660 --> 04:31:51.395
I GUESS I'VE HEARD THESE IN

04:31:51.461 --> 04:31:54.931
JUDICIARY AS WELL. I JUST WANT

04:31:54.998 --> 04:31:57.167
TO QUOTE WHAT YOU JUST SAID.

04:31:57.234 --> 04:31:58.702
THEY WANT TO MAKE A PROFIT.

04:31:58.769 --> 04:32:01.438
WELL, SO ARE YOU SAYING THAT

04:32:01.505 --> 04:32:04.441
THAT'S WRONG? PROFIT IS NOT A

04:32:04.508 --> 04:32:07.277
BAD THING. IN FACT, WE ACTUALLY

04:32:07.344 --> 04:32:09.046
UNDERSTAND THAT OUR ECONOMY IS

04:32:09.112 --> 04:32:10.647
VERY VALUABLE. WE WANT TO

04:32:10.714 --> 04:32:11.581
SUPPORT BUSINESSES. WE WANT TO

04:32:11.648 --> 04:32:13.417
MAKE IT EASIER FOR FOLKS, BUT WE

04:32:13.483 --> 04:32:15.218
ALSO WANT TO PROTECT PEOPLE'S

04:32:15.285 --> 04:32:17.020
RIGHTS TO HAVING A FAIR SHOT.

04:32:17.087 --> 04:32:18.388
RIGHT. AND SO EVEN IN THIS

04:32:18.455 --> 04:32:20.724
PARTICULAR BILL, WE DON'T HAVE A

04:32:20.791 --> 04:32:21.391
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. RIGHT?

04:32:21.458 --> 04:32:23.226
WE ARE TRYING TO JUST MAKE IT A

04:32:23.293 --> 04:32:25.295
FAIR LAW THAT BALANCES BOTH

04:32:25.362 --> 04:32:27.164
SIDES AND SAY THAT WE ARE STILL

04:32:27.230 --> 04:32:28.699
TRYING TO PROTECT THE 40 MILLION

04:32:28.765 --> 04:32:30.300
CALIFORNIANS AND ALSO STILL

04:32:30.367 --> 04:32:32.135
PROTECT BUSINESSES TO DO THE JOB

04:32:32.202 --> 04:32:33.570
THAT THEY NEED TO DO, USE

04:32:33.637 --> 04:32:35.105
WHATEVER SERVICE THEY WANT TO

04:32:35.172 --> 04:32:37.207
USE, BUT ALSO JUST HAVE THIS

04:32:37.274 --> 04:32:39.009
SAFEGUARD IN PLACE. AND AS I'VE

04:32:39.076 --> 04:32:42.245
PRESENTED TO YOU IN THE PAST,

04:32:42.312 --> 04:32:44.748
AGAIN, POLICY DOESN'T CATCH UP

04:32:44.815 --> 04:32:47.284
AS QUICKLY TO TECHNOLOGY AS IT

04:32:47.350 --> 04:32:48.752
NEEDS TO HAPPEN. RIGHT?

04:32:48.819 --> 04:32:50.220
TECHNOLOGY IS UPDATED EVERY SIX

04:32:50.287 --> 04:32:51.655
MINUTES. RIGHT? I KNOW, AND WE

04:32:51.722 --> 04:32:52.689
HAVE DISCUSSED THIS. HERE'S

04:32:52.756 --> 04:32:54.825
WHERE MY ISSUE IS WITH THIS BILL

04:32:54.891 --> 04:32:59.129
OR OTHERS IS THAT THERE IS A

04:32:59.196 --> 04:33:00.530
PRESUMPTION THAT THE DYNAMIC

04:33:00.597 --> 04:33:02.666
PRICING IS A BAD THING.

04:33:02.733 --> 04:33:04.267
SOMETIMES THE PRICES GO DOWN,

04:33:04.334 --> 04:33:06.036
IT'S THE MARKETPLACE, AND YOU

04:33:06.103 --> 04:33:07.838
CAN WALK WITH YOUR FEET. IF YOU

04:33:07.904 --> 04:33:10.640
OR GO TO SOME OTHER RETAILER,

04:33:10.707 --> 04:33:13.977
THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO OBTAIN

04:33:14.044 --> 04:33:15.345
INFORMATION ONLINE, PARTICULARLY

04:33:15.412 --> 04:33:17.814
PEOPLE OBTAIN THAT KIND OF PRICE

04:33:17.881 --> 04:33:18.882
INFORMATION. BUT IF YOU DON'T

04:33:18.949 --> 04:33:21.151
LIKE IT, DON'T BUY IT. AND THE

04:33:21.218 --> 04:33:22.552
PRICE DIFFERENTIAL, I HAVEN'T

04:33:22.619 --> 04:33:24.654
SEEN THE DATA, I'VE SEEN READ

04:33:24.721 --> 04:33:27.124
ABOUT THIS A GREAT DEAL IN YOUR

04:33:27.190 --> 04:33:29.459
DATA, WHERE YOU SHOW THAT THE

04:33:29.526 --> 04:33:31.928
CONSUMER IS PAYING MAYBE A CENT

04:33:31.995 --> 04:33:34.064
MORE OR A HALF CENT MORE OR HALF

04:33:34.131 --> 04:33:35.799
CENT LESS. I MEAN, WE'RE TALKING

04:33:35.866 --> 04:33:38.168
CENTS OR PORTIONS OF CENTS.

04:33:38.235 --> 04:33:39.770
WE'RE NOT TALKING MAJOR DOLLARS.

04:33:39.836 --> 04:33:41.338
NOW, AIRLINES, FOR EXAMPLE, THEY

04:33:41.404 --> 04:33:43.039
HAVE BEEN DOING DYNAMIC PRICING

04:33:43.106 --> 04:33:45.776
FOR 25 YEARS BEFORE ALGORITHMS

04:33:45.842 --> 04:33:46.977
OR THEIR OWN ALGORITHMS THAT

04:33:47.043 --> 04:33:48.979
THEY WERE USING. I MEAN, YOU

04:33:49.045 --> 04:33:51.448
WANT TO FLY AT 3:00 OR MIDNIGHT.

04:33:51.515 --> 04:33:53.483
IT'S CHEAPER THAN FLYING AT 9

04:33:53.550 --> 04:33:55.752
A.M. AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY I'VE

04:33:55.819 --> 04:33:58.155
DONE IT MANY TIMES. SO I'M JUST

04:33:58.221 --> 04:34:00.423
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE

04:34:00.490 --> 04:34:02.859
WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING

04:34:02.926 --> 04:34:04.961
TO FIX WHEN MANUFACTURERS

04:34:05.028 --> 04:34:06.963
PRODUCE PRODUCT TO BE SOLD, THEY

04:34:07.030 --> 04:34:08.665
WANT TO SELL IT AT A PRICE THAT

04:34:08.732 --> 04:34:10.233
SOMEBODY IS GOING TO BUY IT. AND

04:34:10.300 --> 04:34:11.968
IF AND IF THAT PRICE MEANS THAT

04:34:12.035 --> 04:34:14.805
NO ONE'S GOING TO BUY, THEY ARE

04:34:14.871 --> 04:34:16.273
HAVING A PROBLEM AS A BUSINESS.

04:34:16.339 --> 04:34:19.142
SO IT'S CONSTANTLY IN FLUX. BUT

04:34:19.209 --> 04:34:20.544
TO ASSUME THAT BUSINESS IS THE

04:34:20.610 --> 04:34:22.612
BAD GUY, JUST BECAUSE THEY WANT

04:34:22.679 --> 04:34:25.615
A PROFIT IS REALLY COUNTER TO

04:34:25.682 --> 04:34:27.484
OUR WHOLE ECONOMIC SYSTEM.

04:34:27.551 --> 04:34:29.553
PROFIT IS OKAY 100%. AND WE SAY

04:34:29.619 --> 04:34:31.288
THAT AND I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR

04:34:31.354 --> 04:34:34.224
ABOUT THAT. WE SAY YOU CAN USE

04:34:34.291 --> 04:34:35.525
THE ALGORITHMS THAT YOU GUYS

04:34:35.592 --> 04:34:37.027
NEED. YOU GUYS CAN USE THE

04:34:37.093 --> 04:34:38.461
SOFTWARE. YOU GUYS CAN BE

04:34:38.528 --> 04:34:40.630
COMPETITIVE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE,

04:34:40.697 --> 04:34:42.666
BUT ANY ALGORITHM OR SOFTWARE

04:34:42.732 --> 04:34:44.267
THAT COMPARES ANY PUBLICLY

04:34:44.334 --> 04:34:45.735
AVAILABLE DATA AGAINST AN

04:34:45.802 --> 04:34:48.238
INDIVIDUAL'S BUSINESS

04:34:48.305 --> 04:34:50.106
SPECIFICALLY OAN SENSITIVE

04:34:50.173 --> 04:34:52.576
NONPUBLIC DATA, WOULD STILL BE

04:34:52.642 --> 04:34:53.543
ACCEPTABLE UNDER THE TERMS OF

04:34:53.610 --> 04:34:55.378
THIS BILL. RIGHT. SO WE ARE

04:34:55.445 --> 04:34:57.214
VERY, VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT. IF

04:34:57.280 --> 04:34:58.715
THAT SAME SOFTWARE THEN COMBINES

04:34:58.782 --> 04:35:00.450
THE SENSITIVE NONPUBLIC DATA

04:35:00.517 --> 04:35:02.652
FROM ANOTHER COMPETITOR, THEN

04:35:02.719 --> 04:35:03.653
THAT WOULD BE A PROBLEM UNDER

04:35:03.720 --> 04:35:05.255
THE TERMS OF THIS BILL. SO WE

04:35:05.322 --> 04:35:07.190
ARE AGAIN VERY, VERY NARROW IN

04:35:07.257 --> 04:35:10.193
THIS AND SMALL BUSINESSES, AND I

04:35:10.260 --> 04:35:12.095
REPRESENT A COMMUNITY THAT IS

04:35:12.162 --> 04:35:14.097
LARGELY SMALL. BUSINESSES RELY

04:35:14.164 --> 04:35:15.632
ON THESE DIGITAL TOOLS TO HELP

04:35:15.699 --> 04:35:17.767
THEM COMPETE IN THE MARKETPLACE

04:35:17.834 --> 04:35:19.569
AMONG THESE LARGER CORPORATIONS.

04:35:19.636 --> 04:35:21.104
SO IT GIVES THEM AN ADVANTAGE TO

04:35:21.171 --> 04:35:22.572
SOME DEGREE. AND WE RECOGNIZE

04:35:22.639 --> 04:35:23.974
THAT, YOU KNOW WHAT? THEY

04:35:24.040 --> 04:35:25.275
PROBABLY HAVE A BETTER PRICE

04:35:25.342 --> 04:35:26.643
THAN A LARGE CORPORATION IN MANY

04:35:26.710 --> 04:35:28.144
RESPECTS, EXCEPT FOR MAYBE THE

04:35:28.211 --> 04:35:30.013
BIG SUPERSTORES THAT WE KNOW

04:35:30.080 --> 04:35:31.281
ABOUT. BUT THE SMALL BUSINESS

04:35:31.348 --> 04:35:32.916
CAN BE COMPETITIVE. I SHOP IN

04:35:32.983 --> 04:35:34.951
SMALL, WE ALL SHOP IN OUR LOCAL

04:35:35.018 --> 04:35:36.353
BUSINESSES BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN

04:35:36.419 --> 04:35:38.655
LOCAL BUSINESS. AND THERE'S THE

04:35:38.722 --> 04:35:40.390
CONVENIENCE FACTOR THEY COULD

04:35:40.457 --> 04:35:43.293
BE. WE ALL MAKE THOSE INDIVIDUAL

04:35:43.360 --> 04:35:45.729
DECISIONS. BUT THE GOAL OF THIS

04:35:45.795 --> 04:35:47.998
BILL AND WHAT WE ARE HERE TO DO

04:35:48.064 --> 04:35:49.833
IS NONE OF THESE BUSINESSES

04:35:49.900 --> 04:35:51.167
SHOULD BE USING TOOLS THAT

04:35:51.234 --> 04:35:53.103
DIRECTLY FACILITATE THE

04:35:53.169 --> 04:35:55.238
CONDITIONS FOR COLLUSION. THAT

04:35:55.305 --> 04:35:56.306
IS OUR FOCUS. WELL, HAS THAT

04:35:56.373 --> 04:35:59.209
BEEN PROVEN? THERE ARE MANY

04:35:59.276 --> 04:36:01.611
CASES THAT WE HAVE THAT LET ME

04:36:01.678 --> 04:36:03.413
HAVE THERE BEEN COURT CASES THAT

04:36:03.480 --> 04:36:06.349
HAVE CONVICTED OR THE ATTORNEY

04:36:06.416 --> 04:36:08.151
GENERAL DOES GO AFTER CERTAIN

04:36:08.218 --> 04:36:10.487
CASES. AND, YOU KNOW, SHE'S EVEN

04:36:10.554 --> 04:36:12.522
AND THAT'S THAT'S GOOD. THAT

04:36:12.589 --> 04:36:13.890
SHOULD THAT'S THE RESOLUTION. SO

04:36:13.957 --> 04:36:15.692
ANYWAY, WE AND I COULD OFFLINE

04:36:15.759 --> 04:36:16.860
DISCUSS THIS. SO I APPRECIATE

04:36:16.927 --> 04:36:17.994
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO. I'M

04:36:18.061 --> 04:36:19.863
JUST TRYING TO SAY COMPETITION

04:36:19.930 --> 04:36:21.765
IS GOOD PROFITS OKAY. AS LONG AS

04:36:21.831 --> 04:36:24.701
IT'S REASONABLE PROFIT FOR A

04:36:24.768 --> 04:36:26.503
CONDUCTING A BUSINESS. I'M JUST

04:36:26.569 --> 04:36:27.637
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE

04:36:27.704 --> 04:36:29.673
GOING TO HOW CONSUMERS ARE GOING

04:36:29.739 --> 04:36:30.907
TO BENEFIT. BUT I APPRECIATE

04:36:30.974 --> 04:36:32.709
YOUR EFFORTS. SO THANK YOU.

04:36:32.776 --> 04:36:34.778
THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. GO AHEAD.

04:36:34.844 --> 04:36:37.414
THANK YOU, MADAM VICE CHAIR. SO

04:36:37.480 --> 04:36:41.351
I WILL NOTE IN THE ANALYSIS THAT

04:36:41.418 --> 04:36:42.752
THEY POINT OUT THAT THE ORIGINAL

04:36:42.819 --> 04:36:44.888
ALGORITHMIC COLLUSION CASE WAS

04:36:44.955 --> 04:36:48.458
THE AIRLINES. AND IT WAS IT WAS

04:36:48.525 --> 04:36:49.859
WHAT THE SENATORS FOCUSED ON,

04:36:49.926 --> 04:36:51.494
WHICH WAS NONPUBLIC INFORMATION.

04:36:51.561 --> 04:36:52.896
SO THEY WERE SORT OF USING AN

04:36:52.963 --> 04:36:54.164
ALGORITHM TO COMMUNICATE WHAT

04:36:54.230 --> 04:36:55.999
THEY WANTED TO CHARGE. RIGHT? SO

04:36:56.066 --> 04:36:56.633
WASN'T WHAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY

04:36:56.700 --> 04:36:57.734
CHARGING AVAILABLE TO THE

04:36:57.801 --> 04:37:00.770
PUBLIC, AND THAT THE COURTS DID

04:37:00.837 --> 04:37:02.138
FIND THAT THAT WAS COLLUSION

04:37:02.205 --> 04:37:03.139
BECAUSE IT WAS THE SAME AS GOING

04:37:03.206 --> 04:37:05.208
TO A BACK ROOM AND SAYING, I

04:37:05.275 --> 04:37:07.077
WANT TO CHARGE $5. WILL YOU

04:37:07.143 --> 04:37:09.846
CHARGE $5? SO THAT IS, YOU KNOW,

04:37:09.913 --> 04:37:11.081
AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY WHERE

04:37:11.147 --> 04:37:12.716
THE SENATOR IS GOING. YOU KNOW,

04:37:12.782 --> 04:37:15.485
I THINK I SAID THIS IN

04:37:15.552 --> 04:37:16.653
JUDICIARY, BUT I HAVE FOUR GAS

04:37:16.720 --> 04:37:17.587
STATIONS IN MY SMALL TOWN. ONE

04:37:17.654 --> 04:37:18.321
OF THEM IS INDEPENDENTLY OWNED.

04:37:18.388 --> 04:37:20.557
THE THREE OTHERS ARE ALL LARGE

04:37:20.623 --> 04:37:21.825
CORPORATE STATIONS. MY

04:37:21.891 --> 04:37:22.892
INDEPENDENT GUY, WHO I KNOW

04:37:22.959 --> 04:37:24.094
WELL, DRIVES AROUND EVERY

04:37:24.160 --> 04:37:25.261
MORNING AND HE LOOKS AT THE

04:37:25.328 --> 04:37:26.963
PRICES AT THE OTHER GAS

04:37:27.030 --> 04:37:28.031
STATIONS, AND HE UNDERCUTS THEM

04:37:28.098 --> 04:37:29.466
EVERY SINGLE DAY. WE GET LINES

04:37:29.532 --> 04:37:32.002
IN MY TOWN FOR GAS THAT ARE SO

04:37:32.068 --> 04:37:33.803
LONG BECAUSE HE IS UNDERCUTTING

04:37:33.870 --> 04:37:34.904
THE OTHER FOLKS, AND HE'S DOING

04:37:34.971 --> 04:37:36.106
IT THE OLD FASHIONED WAY. HE

04:37:36.172 --> 04:37:38.041
DRIVES AROUND EVERY MORNING AND

04:37:38.108 --> 04:37:39.175
LOOKS AT THE COST, AND THAT IS

04:37:39.242 --> 04:37:41.244
LEGAL AND IT'S BENEFICIAL. SO

04:37:41.311 --> 04:37:42.178
NOBODY, INCLUDING THE AUTHOR,

04:37:42.245 --> 04:37:44.114
WANTS TO STOP THAT. AND I THINK

04:37:44.180 --> 04:37:45.615
THAT'S WHY THIS SPECIFICALLY

04:37:45.682 --> 04:37:46.616
DOESN'T INCLUDE PUBLIC

04:37:46.683 --> 04:37:48.218
INFORMATION, LIKE LOOKING AT THE

04:37:48.284 --> 04:37:49.986
GAS PRICES THAT ARE POSTED IN

04:37:50.053 --> 04:37:52.422
THE BIG SIGNS. BUT IT DOES SAY

04:37:52.489 --> 04:37:54.057
THAT YOU CAN'T USE THESE

04:37:54.124 --> 04:37:55.258
ALGORITHMS TO TAKE NONPUBLIC

04:37:55.325 --> 04:37:56.426
INFORMATION. AND I THINK, YOU

04:37:56.493 --> 04:37:58.495
KNOW, THIS REALLY CAME TO A HEAD

04:37:58.561 --> 04:38:01.064
WHEN, YOU KNOW, THE REALPAGE

04:38:01.131 --> 04:38:02.165
EXAMPLE, WHICH IS IN THE

04:38:02.232 --> 04:38:04.067
ANALYSIS AS WELL, YOU KNOW,

04:38:04.134 --> 04:38:05.835
OFTEN IT WASN'T EVEN THAT, YOU

04:38:05.902 --> 04:38:07.670
KNOW, THEY WERE HAD THESE

04:38:07.737 --> 04:38:09.672
COMPANIES DO MANY THINGS OFTEN.

04:38:09.739 --> 04:38:11.541
AND SO THEY HAD NONPUBLIC

04:38:11.608 --> 04:38:14.744
INFORMATION FROM OTHER ENTITIES.

04:38:14.811 --> 04:38:17.013
AND THEN IT WAS. YEAH, RIGHT. SO

04:38:17.080 --> 04:38:19.149
IF YOU'RE MANAGING I MEAN, AND I

04:38:19.215 --> 04:38:20.116
DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW THEY

04:38:20.183 --> 04:38:22.485
WORK, BUT THIS IS HOW I THINK OF

04:38:22.552 --> 04:38:24.187
IT. YOU KNOW, IF YOU HAVE AN

04:38:24.254 --> 04:38:24.854
APARTMENT MANAGEMENT TOOL, THEY

04:38:24.921 --> 04:38:26.356
KNOW, YOU KNOW, WHAT IS THE

04:38:26.423 --> 04:38:28.691
VACANCY RATE. THEY KNOW, BUT

04:38:28.758 --> 04:38:29.259
THAT'S NOT AVAILABLE TO THE

04:38:29.325 --> 04:38:30.226
PUBLIC. BUT BECAUSE THEY'RE

04:38:30.293 --> 04:38:32.028
MANAGING THE SOFTWARE'S MANAGING

04:38:32.095 --> 04:38:34.431
THE VACANCY, IT'S ON THE BACK

04:38:34.497 --> 04:38:36.032
END. WELL, THAT'S NOT I DON'T

04:38:36.099 --> 04:38:37.534
KNOW HOW YOU WOULD PUBLICLY FIND

04:38:37.600 --> 04:38:39.436
OUT. THERE ARE SO MANY WAYS TO

04:38:39.502 --> 04:38:41.805
FIND OUT WHAT'S WHAT. HOUSES ARE

04:38:41.871 --> 04:38:43.473
FOR SALE. WHAT? WELL, THAT WILL

04:38:43.540 --> 04:38:45.375
BE FOR THE COURTS TO FIGURE OUT.

04:38:45.442 --> 04:38:47.177
WAS THIS PUBLIC INFORMATION OR

04:38:47.243 --> 04:38:48.311
NOT? IT'S NOT FOR US TO DICTATE

04:38:48.378 --> 04:38:50.213
WHAT IS PUBLIC AND WHAT IS NOT.

04:38:50.280 --> 04:38:52.215
AND MANY WELL-PAID LAWYERS WILL

04:38:52.282 --> 04:38:53.083
FIGHT THAT OUT IN COURT. SO, I

04:38:53.149 --> 04:38:54.417
MEAN, I DO THINK THAT THAT'S

04:38:54.484 --> 04:38:56.719
WHERE, YOU KNOW, AND I

04:38:56.786 --> 04:38:57.353
APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF MY

04:38:57.420 --> 04:38:58.088
COLLEAGUES AROUND THE BILLS

04:38:58.154 --> 04:38:59.489
COMING TOGETHER. THAT WAS MY

04:38:59.556 --> 04:39:00.957
DESIRE. I THINK, YOU KNOW, I

04:39:01.024 --> 04:39:02.826
SAID IT IN JUDICIARY, SAYING IT

04:39:02.892 --> 04:39:04.260
AGAIN HERE. YOU KNOW, I THINK WE

04:39:04.327 --> 04:39:06.096
ARE BETTER OFF IF WE GET TO ONE

04:39:06.162 --> 04:39:08.164
POLICY. THE REASON THESE BILLS

04:39:08.231 --> 04:39:09.199
KEEP MOVING IS BECAUSE WE AGREE

04:39:09.265 --> 04:39:10.400
THIS IS IMPORTANT POLICY. I

04:39:10.467 --> 04:39:11.568
THINK IT SOUNDS LIKE THE

04:39:11.634 --> 04:39:13.870
OPPOSITION IS WILLING TO WORK

04:39:13.937 --> 04:39:15.772
HOPEFULLY TO, YOU KNOW, MOVE

04:39:15.839 --> 04:39:17.440
THIS POLICY FORWARD AS WELL,

04:39:17.507 --> 04:39:19.909
BECAUSE FUNDAMENTALLY, AN

04:39:19.976 --> 04:39:20.944
ANTI-COMPETITIVE MARKET IS NOT

04:39:21.010 --> 04:39:23.980
ONE THAT IS GOOD FOR SOCIETY OR

04:39:24.047 --> 04:39:25.081
CALIFORNIANS. SO WE ARE MOVING

04:39:25.148 --> 04:39:26.516
ALL THESE BILLS OUT BECAUSE WE

04:39:26.583 --> 04:39:28.418
BELIEVE IN THE POLICY UNDER

04:39:28.485 --> 04:39:29.986
WHICH THEY ARE ALL TRYING TO

04:39:30.053 --> 04:39:31.788
MOVE FORWARD. BUT I THINK AS A

04:39:31.855 --> 04:39:32.922
FORMER REGULATORY LAWYER MYSELF,

04:39:32.989 --> 04:39:35.859
IT WOULD BE A MESS IF WE DID

04:39:35.925 --> 04:39:37.961
PASS AND HAVE ALL THREE OF THESE

04:39:38.027 --> 04:39:39.329
BILLS SIGNED INTO LAW. WE NEED

04:39:39.395 --> 04:39:40.930
ONE COHERENT LEGAL STRATEGY, SO

04:39:40.997 --> 04:39:43.032
I AM OPTIMISTIC THAT THAT WILL

04:39:43.099 --> 04:39:44.768
HAPPEN, AND I WILL SHARE IN MY

04:39:44.834 --> 04:39:46.269
COLLEAGUE'S COMMENTS URGING ALL

04:39:46.336 --> 04:39:48.304
THREE AUTHORS TO DO SO, ALTHOUGH

04:39:48.371 --> 04:39:50.807
I WASN'T HERE FOR THE FIRST ONE,

04:39:50.874 --> 04:39:51.374
BUT I HAVE SAID IT TO HER

04:39:51.441 --> 04:39:53.176
PREVIOUS TO THIS, SO I THINK WE

04:39:53.243 --> 04:39:55.578
CAN DO THAT, AND I THINK WE WILL

04:39:55.645 --> 04:39:57.013
HOPEFULLY COME OUT WITH A POLICY

04:39:57.080 --> 04:39:58.248
THAT HELPS CALIFORNIANS. AND

04:39:58.314 --> 04:39:59.349
WITH THAT, WOULD YOU LIKE TO

04:39:59.415 --> 04:40:01.017
CLOSE? YES. AND I JUST WANT TO

04:40:01.084 --> 04:40:02.185
HIGHLIGHT THAT THIS BILL IS NOT

04:40:02.252 --> 04:40:04.254
ONLY GOOD FOR CONSUMERS, BUT

04:40:04.320 --> 04:40:05.054
IT'S ALSO GOOD FOR SMALL

04:40:05.121 --> 04:40:05.655
BUSINESSES, SMALL BUSINESSES

04:40:05.722 --> 04:40:07.157
THAT ACTUALLY COMPETE WITH LARGE

04:40:07.223 --> 04:40:08.892
BUSINESSES TO JUST BE IN THE

04:40:08.958 --> 04:40:09.893
MARKET. WE HAVE SEEN TIME AND

04:40:09.959 --> 04:40:11.294
TIME AGAIN THAT THOSE COMPANIES

04:40:11.361 --> 04:40:12.495
THAT ARE ABLE TO AFFORD THESE

04:40:12.562 --> 04:40:14.764
TYPES OF UNDERCUTTING SOFTWARE,

04:40:14.831 --> 04:40:19.068
AS YOU DESCRIBED IT, ALSO ARE

04:40:19.135 --> 04:40:20.270
STRUGGLING IN THE SMALL BUSINESS

04:40:20.336 --> 04:40:22.272
SPACE. RIGHT. AND WHEN WE ARE

04:40:22.338 --> 04:40:25.008
ALSO SEEING GIANT CORPORATIONS

04:40:25.074 --> 04:40:27.310
THAT ARE MINING DATA OVER AND

04:40:27.377 --> 04:40:29.045
OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND HAVING

04:40:29.112 --> 04:40:30.513
NO SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE IN THE

04:40:30.580 --> 04:40:32.148
STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH 40

04:40:32.215 --> 04:40:33.850
MILLION INDIVIDUALS THAT COULD

04:40:33.917 --> 04:40:35.985
POTENTIALLY BE CONSUMERS. AND WE

04:40:36.052 --> 04:40:38.154
SEE PRICE GOUGING, WE SEE UNFAIR

04:40:38.221 --> 04:40:40.623
PRACTICES, AND WE SEE MUCH MORE.

04:40:40.690 --> 04:40:44.160
WE DO BELIEVE IN A VERY STRONG

04:40:44.227 --> 04:40:45.995
COMPETITIVE MARKET IN ANY FIELD,

04:40:46.062 --> 04:40:47.564
AND THAT IS THE GOAL WHEN WE'RE

04:40:47.630 --> 04:40:49.265
TALKING ABOUT DIVERSIFICATION

04:40:49.332 --> 04:40:51.034
AND MUCH MORE. BUT TO DO THAT,

04:40:51.100 --> 04:40:52.402
WE ALSO NEED TO HAVE SAFEGUARDS

04:40:52.468 --> 04:40:53.970
IN PLACE THAT PROTECT THE

04:40:54.037 --> 04:40:55.738
CONSUMER, THE SMALL BUSINESS AND

04:40:55.805 --> 04:40:57.607
ALSO HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE. SO

04:40:57.674 --> 04:41:00.143
THAT IS WHAT THIS BILL IS. AND I

04:41:00.210 --> 04:41:02.378
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE

04:41:02.445 --> 04:41:04.681
VOTE. THANK YOU. AND WE HAVE A

04:41:04.747 --> 04:41:06.416
MOTION AND A SECOND OR FIRST

04:41:06.482 --> 04:41:07.717
OKAY. WE HAVE A WE NEED A

04:41:07.784 --> 04:41:10.920
SECOND. OKAY. GREAT. OKAY. LET'S

04:41:10.987 --> 04:41:13.890
CALL THE ROLL ITEM NUMBER 12 SB

04:41:13.957 --> 04:41:15.858

WILSON. WE HAVE THREE, BUT WE'LL

04:41:43.419 --> 04:41:45.355
HOLD THE ROLL OPEN FOR ABSENT

04:41:45.421 --> 04:41:48.124
MEMBERS. YOU CAN. SENATOR WAHAB,

04:41:48.191 --> 04:41:52.695
I THINK YOU HAVE ONE MORE BILL.

04:41:52.762 --> 04:41:54.864
SB 435, WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK

04:41:54.931 --> 04:41:57.967
YOU. YEAH, I THOUGHT YOU HAD

04:41:58.034 --> 04:42:04.073
ONE. NO, NOT THAT LUCKY. ALL

04:42:04.140 --> 04:42:05.275
RIGHT, CHAIR, COLLEAGUES AND

04:42:05.341 --> 04:42:07.377
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC, I WANT TO

04:42:07.443 --> 04:42:09.112
THANK YOU ALL AND THE COMMITTEE

04:42:09.178 --> 04:42:10.880
STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS

04:42:10.947 --> 04:42:12.815
BILL. AND I ACCEPT THE

04:42:12.882 --> 04:42:15.585
AMENDMENTS. I ALSO WANT TO THANK

04:42:15.652 --> 04:42:17.153
ASSEMBLY MEMBERS BONTA,

04:42:17.220 --> 04:42:18.488
LOWENTHAL AND GARCIA FOR BEING

04:42:18.554 --> 04:42:20.723
COAUTHORS OF THIS BILL. YOU

04:42:20.790 --> 04:42:22.925
KNOW, HONESTLY, ABOUT SIX WEEKS

04:42:22.992 --> 04:42:24.861
AGO, I READ ABOUT AN ARTICLE

04:42:24.927 --> 04:42:26.429
THAT CARFAX WAS SHARING DATA.

04:42:26.496 --> 04:42:30.533
THEY GATHER WITH ICE, AND THAT

04:42:30.600 --> 04:42:32.235
WAS CONCERNING. AND I WAS TAKING

04:42:32.302 --> 04:42:33.269
A LOOK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT

04:42:33.336 --> 04:42:36.205
WHAT WHAT GOES ON WITH OUR DATA.

04:42:36.272 --> 04:42:36.806
AND WE OFTENTIMES THINK THAT,

04:42:36.873 --> 04:42:38.608
YOU KNOW, IF WE FILL UP THE

04:42:38.675 --> 04:42:40.109
PAPERWORK, WE'RE GOOD TO GO, AND

04:42:40.176 --> 04:42:42.612
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE SHARED WITH

04:42:42.679 --> 04:42:45.882
ANY OTHER ENTITY THAT HAS ZERO

BUSINESSES TO COLLECT AND SELL

04:47:40.376 --> 04:47:42.912

STATUS HOUSEHOLDS, THAT LOOPHOLE

04:48:16.479 --> 04:48:18.214
ISN'T THEORETICAL. IT IS AN

04:48:18.280 --> 04:48:20.082
IMMINENT THREAT. WE'VE SEEN WHAT

04:48:20.149 --> 04:48:21.150
HAPPENS WHEN THIS DATA ENDS UP

04:48:21.217 --> 04:48:23.486
IN THE HANDS OF IMMIGRATION

04:48:23.552 --> 04:48:24.253
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. PARENTS

04:48:24.320 --> 04:48:26.055
ARE PICKED UP ON THEIR WAY TO

WORK OR WHILE DROPPING OFF THEIR

COME HOME TO FIND A PARENT GONE

04:48:31.093 --> 04:48:32.595
OR WASH THEIR CAREGIVER, BE

04:48:32.662 --> 04:48:34.830
TAKEN AWAY IN REAL TIME. THAT

04:48:34.897 --> 04:48:36.132
KIND OF TRAUMA STAYS WITH A

04:48:41.303 --> 04:48:42.405
WON'T UNDO THE HARM THAT'S

04:48:42.471 --> 04:48:44.340
ALREADY BEEN DONE, BUT IT WILL

04:48:44.407 --> 04:48:46.642
PREVENT FURTHER EXPLOITATION BY

BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ACTORS.

04:48:48.811 --> 04:48:51.147

WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU YOUR OWN

ME. CALIFORNIA LAW AND VOTERS

04:49:44.166 --> 04:49:45.434
HAVE BEEN CLEAR ABOUT HOW

04:49:45.501 --> 04:49:46.602
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION

04:49:46.669 --> 04:49:48.437
IS TO BE TREATED UNDER THE CCPA,

04:49:48.504 --> 04:49:49.638
BALANCING PRIVACY AND FIRST

04:49:49.705 --> 04:49:51.707
AMENDMENT RIGHTS NOT ONCE, BUT

04:49:51.774 --> 04:49:53.976
THREE TIMES NOW. AND THE CCPA.

04:49:54.043 --> 04:49:55.444
WE ADDED A RATHER NARROW

04:49:55.511 --> 04:49:57.313
EXCEPTION, ACTUALLY NOT FOR

04:49:57.379 --> 04:49:58.447
DISSIMILAR CONCERNS AND THOSE

04:49:58.514 --> 04:49:59.415
THAT WE HAVE DISCUSSED WITH THE

04:49:59.482 --> 04:50:01.150

04:50:01.217 --> 04:50:02.885
OUR FIRST CONVERSATION, I SHOULD

04:50:02.952 --> 04:50:04.720
SAY. BUT AFTER CONTINUED

04:50:04.787 --> 04:50:05.921
CONCERNS ABOUT FIRST AMENDMENT

04:50:05.988 --> 04:50:07.256
AND BUSINESS IMPACTS, THE

04:50:07.323 --> 04:50:08.557
LEGISLATURE PASSED, I BELIEVE IT

04:50:08.624 --> 04:50:10.993
WAS AB 874 BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER

04:50:11.060 --> 04:50:12.962
ERWIN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY IN THE

04:50:13.028 --> 04:50:14.363
CCPA CLEANUP THAT HAPPENED IN

04:50:14.430 --> 04:50:15.998
THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF THE

04:50:16.065 --> 04:50:18.501
CCPA IN 2020. VOTERS THEN

04:50:18.567 --> 04:50:19.869
BROADENED THE EXEMPTION EVEN

04:50:19.935 --> 04:50:21.403
FURTHER IN PROP 24 AND EXTENDED

04:50:21.470 --> 04:50:23.139
IT TO SENSITIVE PERSONAL

04:50:23.205 --> 04:50:26.175
INFORMATION. SB 435, AS DRAFTED,

04:50:26.242 --> 04:50:27.343
WOULD UPEND THAT BALANCE AND

04:50:27.409 --> 04:50:28.611
UNDERMINE THE SUBSTANTIAL

04:50:28.677 --> 04:50:30.012
SOCIETAL BENEFITS AND ACCESS TO

04:50:31.881 --> 04:50:33.115
BENEFITS THAT HAVE BEEN LONG

04:50:33.182 --> 04:50:34.650
RECOGNIZED BY THE US SUPREME

04:50:34.717 --> 04:50:35.718
COURT, AND THE RAMIFICATIONS OF

04:50:35.785 --> 04:50:37.153
DOING SO WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT

04:50:37.219 --> 04:50:38.420
FOR OUR MEMBERS, NOT MERELY IN

04:50:38.487 --> 04:50:39.789
TERMS OF INFRINGING UPON THEIR

COMPLIANCE STANDPOINT.

04:50:42.525 --> 04:50:43.859
BUSINESSES HAVE SPENT YEARS AND

04:50:43.926 --> 04:50:45.094
RESOURCES BUILDING SYSTEMS TO

04:50:45.161 --> 04:50:46.162
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN PUBLICLY

SENSITIVE PII UNDER THE CCPA FOR

COMPLIANCE AND CONSUMER RIGHTS.

04:50:50.833 --> 04:50:51.834
THIS BILL WOULD DISRUPT THAT AND

04:50:51.901 --> 04:50:53.302
MAKE COMPLIANCE NEARLY

04:50:53.369 --> 04:50:55.104
IMPOSSIBLE. THIS WILL INVARIABLY

04:50:55.171 --> 04:50:56.338
UNDERMINE OUR MEMBERS ABILITY TO

04:50:57.673 --> 04:50:59.708
CONSUMER RIGHTS. THAT BEING

04:50:59.775 --> 04:51:00.876
SAID, AFTER FURTHER

04:51:00.943 --> 04:51:01.710
CONVERSATIONS, TO THE EXTENT

04:51:01.777 --> 04:51:02.978
THAT THE CONCERN IS SOMETHING

04:51:03.045 --> 04:51:04.246
MORE SPECIFIC THAN A GENERALIZED

04:51:04.313 --> 04:51:05.948
RIGHT OF PRIVACY, WE ARE HAPPY

04:51:06.015 --> 04:51:07.349
TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH

04:51:07.416 --> 04:51:09.618
THE AUTHOR. WE KNOW, FOR

04:51:09.685 --> 04:51:10.920
EXAMPLE, THERE'S A LOT OF

04:51:10.986 --> 04:51:12.188
CONCERN RIGHT NOW OVER PRECISE

04:51:12.254 --> 04:51:14.223
GEOLOCATION DATA AND OVER

04:51:14.290 --> 04:51:14.890
NATIONALITY AND IMMIGRATION DATA

04:51:14.957 --> 04:51:16.725
AT THIS POINT IN TIME, AS STATED

04:51:16.792 --> 04:51:18.928
BY OUR CEO JENNIFER BARRERA LAST

04:51:18.994 --> 04:51:20.329
MONTH, THE CURRENT SITUATION IS

04:51:20.396 --> 04:51:22.898
BAD FOR BOTH COMMUNITIES AND BAD

04:51:22.965 --> 04:51:24.667
FOR BUSINESSES. I THINK THERE'S

04:51:24.733 --> 04:51:26.135
BROAD CONSENSUS THAT THOSE WHO

04:51:26.202 --> 04:51:27.403
HAVE LIVED AND WORKED HERE FOR

04:51:27.469 --> 04:51:29.004
YEARS SHOULD BE GIVEN A PATHWAY

04:51:29.071 --> 04:51:30.472
TO LEGALLY DO SO WITHOUT FEAR.

04:51:30.539 --> 04:51:32.241
AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW

04:51:32.308 --> 04:51:34.143
JUST HAS SERIOUS IMPACTS FOR OUR

04:51:34.210 --> 04:51:34.743
ECONOMY, OUR COMMUNITIES, AND

04:51:34.810 --> 04:51:36.278
THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE

04:51:36.345 --> 04:51:38.614
AND WORK IN THIS STATE. SO WE

04:51:38.681 --> 04:51:39.281
CARE DEEPLY ABOUT OUR EMPLOYEES,

04:51:39.348 --> 04:51:40.883
WE CARE ABOUT OUR COWORKERS, AND

04:51:40.950 --> 04:51:42.418
OUR INTERESTS ARE CLOSELY

04:51:42.484 --> 04:51:43.018
INTERTWINED. THAT BEING SAID,

04:51:43.085 --> 04:51:44.887
AGAIN, WE DO WANT TO JUST REMIND

04:51:44.954 --> 04:51:46.789
THAT THE CCPA AND ACPA AND A

04:51:46.856 --> 04:51:47.990
WHOLE HOST OF OTHER CALIFORNIA

04:51:48.057 --> 04:51:49.158
LAWS HAVE BEEN ENACTED OVER THE

04:51:49.225 --> 04:51:49.959
YEARS, BOTH GENERALLY AND

04:51:50.025 --> 04:51:51.260
SPECIFICALLY, TO PROTECT THIS

04:51:51.327 --> 04:51:53.062
INFORMATION FROM ANY SORT OF

04:51:53.128 --> 04:51:54.864
ABUSES. AND SO WHILE ALSO

04:51:54.930 --> 04:51:55.931
PRESERVING IT FOR LEGITIMATE

04:51:55.998 --> 04:51:57.666
BUSINESS USES AND SO PRESERVING

04:51:57.733 --> 04:51:59.635
THE WELL, EXCUSE ME, WHILE ALSO

04:51:59.702 --> 04:52:01.737
PRESERVING THE PUBLIC'S

04:52:01.804 --> 04:52:03.138
CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED RIGHT

04:52:03.205 --> 04:52:04.440
TO INFORMATION. SO WITH ALL THAT

04:52:04.506 --> 04:52:06.008
BEING SAID, WE ARE, OF COURSE,

04:52:06.075 --> 04:52:07.243
OPEN TO CLOSING ANY SORT OF GAPS

04:52:07.309 --> 04:52:09.011
THAT MAY EXIST, EXAMINING THOSE

04:52:09.078 --> 04:52:11.113
AGAIN WITH OPEN EYES TO SEE IF

04:52:11.180 --> 04:52:12.248
THERE'S SOMETHING WE ARE

04:52:12.314 --> 04:52:13.382
MISSING. WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE

04:52:13.449 --> 04:52:13.983
THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

04:52:14.049 --> 04:52:15.317
AUTHOR MOVING FORWARD. KEEP THE

04:52:15.384 --> 04:52:16.685
COMMUNITY COMMITTEE IN THE LOOP

04:52:16.752 --> 04:52:19.388
AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING

04:52:19.455 --> 04:52:22.958
THOSE. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU,

04:52:23.025 --> 04:52:24.193
THANK YOU. SURE. MY MIC WAS ON

04:52:24.260 --> 04:52:26.562
NOW. ANYBODY ELSE HERE IN

04:52:26.629 --> 04:52:28.764
OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL NAME

04:52:28.831 --> 04:52:30.633
ORGANIZATION AND POSITION

04:52:30.699 --> 04:52:34.570
PLEASE. ROBERT BOYKIN WITH

04:52:34.637 --> 04:52:35.537
TECHNET AND RESPECTFUL

04:52:35.604 --> 04:52:37.473
OPPOSITION. WE'RE HEARING THE

04:52:37.539 --> 04:52:39.775
MIC ISN'T WORKING. SO IF YOU

04:52:39.842 --> 04:52:40.376
JUST WAIT ONE SECOND, IS IT

04:52:40.442 --> 04:52:42.478
WORKING NOW? OKAY, GREAT. SORRY.

04:52:42.544 --> 04:52:44.513
I WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE CAN

04:52:44.580 --> 04:52:46.282
HEAR YOU IN THE WORLD. GOOD

04:52:46.348 --> 04:52:47.917
AFTERNOON, CHAIR AND MEMBERS, ON

04:52:47.983 --> 04:52:49.318
BEHALF OF THE COMPUTER AND

04:52:49.385 --> 04:52:49.919
COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY

04:52:49.985 --> 04:52:51.086
ASSOCIATION, WE WOULD ECHO THE

04:52:51.153 --> 04:52:53.389
COMMENTS MADE BY THE CALIFORNIA

04:52:53.455 --> 04:52:54.490
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. THANK YOU,

04:52:54.556 --> 04:52:58.227
THANK YOU. BRINGING IT BACK TO

04:52:58.294 --> 04:52:58.861
THE COMMITTEE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S

04:52:58.928 --> 04:53:02.531
NGUYEN. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING

04:53:02.598 --> 04:53:04.400
THIS BILL FORWARD. I AM NOT

04:53:04.466 --> 04:53:06.235
GOING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT

04:53:06.302 --> 04:53:08.270
TODAY, BUT I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE

04:53:08.337 --> 04:53:11.140
THE HUGE CONCERN WE HAVE WITH,

04:53:11.206 --> 04:53:12.541
WITH WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH

04:53:12.608 --> 04:53:15.811
CURRENT IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT

04:53:15.878 --> 04:53:18.747
AND THEN THE LOCATION DATA, THE

04:53:18.814 --> 04:53:19.915
SENSITIVITY OF LOCATION DATA,

04:53:19.982 --> 04:53:21.317
THOSE STORIES ABOUT WHAT DATA

04:53:21.383 --> 04:53:23.385
BROKERS ARE DOING ARE AWFUL. AND

04:53:23.452 --> 04:53:25.220
LUCKILY, OUR COLLEAGUE IN THE

04:53:25.287 --> 04:53:28.791
SENATE, SENATOR BECKER, HAS A

04:53:28.857 --> 04:53:30.259
BILL OR HAS A BILL THAT HAS

04:53:30.326 --> 04:53:32.661
PASSED THAT IS GOING TO BE WHERE

04:53:32.728 --> 04:53:34.596
WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO EASILY

04:53:34.663 --> 04:53:36.699
OPT OUT OF COLLECTION OF DATA

04:53:36.765 --> 04:53:39.601
FROM DATA BROKERS, AS WAS

04:53:39.668 --> 04:53:40.970
MENTIONED BY THE REPRESENTATIVE

04:53:41.036 --> 04:53:42.738
FROM THE CHAMBER. I AUTHORED THE

04:53:42.805 --> 04:53:47.643
BILL 8874 TO REFORM THE

04:53:47.710 --> 04:53:50.112
DEFINITION OF PUBLICLY AVAILABLE

04:53:50.179 --> 04:53:51.513
INFORMATION TO SERVE BOTH

04:53:51.580 --> 04:53:53.315
PRACTICAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL

04:53:53.382 --> 04:53:54.316
ISSUES WITH THE LANGUAGE, AND

04:53:54.383 --> 04:53:56.151
THEN THAT WAS REAFFIRMED AGAIN

04:53:56.218 --> 04:54:01.957
BY THE PROPOSITION 24 IN 2020.

04:54:02.024 --> 04:54:05.527
AND THERE'S JUST IT IS

04:54:05.594 --> 04:54:06.295
PROBLEMATIC WHEN THERE'S

04:54:06.362 --> 04:54:07.696
INFORMATION THAT'S AVAILABLE IN

04:54:07.763 --> 04:54:09.765
THE NEWSPAPERS OR ON SOCIAL

04:54:09.832 --> 04:54:15.671
MEDIA THAT IS PUBLIC TO NOW TRY

04:54:15.738 --> 04:54:19.508
TO SUBJECT IT TO CCPA. SO

04:54:19.575 --> 04:54:20.709
BECAUSE OF THAT, BECAUSE OF

04:54:20.776 --> 04:54:22.177
THESE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES, I'M

04:54:22.244 --> 04:54:24.747
JUST NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO

04:54:24.813 --> 04:54:25.381
SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. BUT I

04:54:25.447 --> 04:54:27.916
APPRECIATE ALL THE YOUR WORK AND

04:54:27.983 --> 04:54:31.320
YOUR CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE

04:54:31.387 --> 04:54:33.655
CHAMBER TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES.

04:54:33.722 --> 04:54:37.960
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. SO THE

04:54:38.027 --> 04:54:39.428
CCPA IS ABOUT GIVING CONSUMERS

04:54:39.495 --> 04:54:41.196
MORE CONTROL OVER THEIR PERSONAL

04:54:41.263 --> 04:54:42.231
INFORMATION THAT BUSINESSES

04:54:42.297 --> 04:54:44.400
COLLECT. THE CCPA CREATED

04:54:44.466 --> 04:54:45.567
REGULATIONS THAT SECURED NEW

04:54:45.634 --> 04:54:47.236
PRIVACY RIGHTS FOR CALIFORNIANS

04:54:47.302 --> 04:54:49.772
IN 2020. THE PROPOSITION THAT'S

04:54:49.838 --> 04:54:51.340
BEING REFERRED TO AS PROP 24,

04:54:51.407 --> 04:54:53.442
THE CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS

04:54:53.509 --> 04:54:55.944
ACT, WHICH ADDED ADDITIONAL

04:54:56.011 --> 04:54:57.212
PROTECTIONS. IT IS THE FLOOR,

04:54:57.279 --> 04:54:59.314
NOT THE CEILING, AND WE NEED TO

04:54:59.381 --> 04:55:00.949
CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THAT. THE

04:55:01.016 --> 04:55:02.651
CCPA IS BUILT UPON SIX PILLARS,

04:55:02.718 --> 04:55:03.952
WHICH IMPORTANTLY PROVIDES THE

04:55:04.019 --> 04:55:05.320
ABILITY FOR A CONSUMER TO

04:55:05.387 --> 04:55:07.890
REQUEST THE DELETION OF PERSONAL

04:55:07.956 --> 04:55:09.925
INFORMATION. RIGHT TO KNOW,

04:55:09.992 --> 04:55:11.393
DELETE, OPT OUT

04:55:11.460 --> 04:55:12.828
NONDISCRIMINATION, CORRECT, AND

04:55:12.895 --> 04:55:15.764
TO LIMIT. HOWEVER, THE CCPA ONLY

04:55:15.831 --> 04:55:18.300
APPLIES TO ANY BUSINESS THAT

04:55:18.367 --> 04:55:21.136
EARNS MORE THAN $25 MILLION IN

04:55:21.203 --> 04:55:23.639
ANNUAL REVENUE, BUYS, SELLS, OR

04:55:23.705 --> 04:55:26.475
SHARES PERSONAL DATA OF 100,000

04:55:26.542 --> 04:55:28.710
REVENUE OR MORE CONSUMERS, OR

04:55:28.777 --> 04:55:30.879
EARNS 50% OR MORE OF THEIR

04:55:30.946 --> 04:55:32.347
ANNUAL REVENUES FROM SELLING

04:55:32.414 --> 04:55:35.117
PERSONAL INFORMATION. SO SB 435

04:55:35.184 --> 04:55:36.752
IS ABOUT PROTECTING SENSITIVE

04:55:36.819 --> 04:55:37.820
PERSONAL INFORMATION TO ENSURE

04:55:37.886 --> 04:55:40.656
THAT IT IS ALWAYS TREATED AS

04:55:40.722 --> 04:55:41.890
SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION.

04:55:41.957 --> 04:55:43.725
IF AN INDIVIDUAL POSTS THEIR

04:55:43.792 --> 04:55:45.727
CITIZENSHIP STATUS ON SOCIAL

04:55:45.794 --> 04:55:48.363
MEDIA THAT CORPORATIONS CAN DEEM

04:55:48.430 --> 04:55:49.932
THAT INFORMATION PUBLICLY

04:55:49.998 --> 04:55:51.100
AVAILABLE, LEADING TO CONSUMERS

04:55:51.166 --> 04:55:53.102
LOSING THEIR RIGHTS OVER THEIR

04:55:53.168 --> 04:55:54.336
INFORMATION. EVEN IF THEY DELETE

04:55:54.403 --> 04:55:56.872
THE POST, THEY LOSE THE RIGHT TO

04:55:56.939 --> 04:55:58.774
REQUEST DELETION OF CERTAIN

04:55:58.841 --> 04:56:00.008
INFORMATION UNDER THE CCPA. SO

04:56:00.075 --> 04:56:03.679
SB 435 ENSURES THAT THE RIGHTS

04:56:03.745 --> 04:56:05.080
CONSUMERS HAVE RELATIVE TO THEIR

04:56:05.147 --> 04:56:06.915
SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION

04:56:06.982 --> 04:56:08.750
ALWAYS APPLIES AND ARE NOT

04:56:08.817 --> 04:56:09.751
STRIPPED AWAY BECAUSE THE

04:56:09.818 --> 04:56:10.819
INFORMATION IS CONSIDERED

04:56:10.886 --> 04:56:12.688
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE IN SOME

04:56:12.754 --> 04:56:13.889
FASHION. AND I DO BELIEVE THAT

04:56:13.956 --> 04:56:15.424
WE ALL DESERVE THE RIGHT TO BE

04:56:15.491 --> 04:56:17.259
ABLE TO GO TO DATA BROKERS AND

04:56:17.326 --> 04:56:20.195
SAY, HEY, THIS TYPE OF

04:56:20.262 --> 04:56:26.401
INFORMATION SHOULD BE DELETED.

04:56:26.468 --> 04:56:27.035
YEAH. THANK YOU, ASSEMBLYMEMBER

04:56:27.102 --> 04:56:30.606
DEMAIO. I REFRAINED FROM

04:56:30.672 --> 04:56:31.773
SPEAKING ON SOME OF THE OTHER

04:56:31.840 --> 04:56:33.375
BILLS BECAUSE MY COMMENTS THAT

04:56:33.442 --> 04:56:35.677
I'M ABOUT TO MAKE KIND OF COVER

04:56:35.744 --> 04:56:37.880
MY NO VOTES ON THOSE BILLS AND

04:56:37.946 --> 04:56:41.416
MY NO VOTE ON THIS BILL AS WELL.

04:56:41.483 --> 04:56:44.186
I THINK PEOPLE WHO ARE THIS IS A

04:56:44.253 --> 04:56:47.456
UNIQUE COMMITTEE. ACTUALLY, THE

04:56:47.523 --> 04:56:49.858
I LIKE THE COMMITTEE IN THAT

04:56:49.925 --> 04:56:52.461
IT'S NOT OVERTLY PARTIZAN. AND

04:56:52.528 --> 04:56:54.163
WHEN PEOPLE COME HERE WITH A

04:56:54.229 --> 04:56:55.731
BILL, THERE'S ALWAYS A GOOD

04:56:55.797 --> 04:56:58.000
INTENTION. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT

04:56:58.066 --> 04:57:00.169
MAMA TAUGHT YOU? THE ROAD TO

04:57:00.235 --> 04:57:02.638
HELL IS PAVED WITH GOOD

04:57:02.704 --> 04:57:04.907
INTENTIONS. AND I FEAR THAT A

04:57:04.973 --> 04:57:06.975
LOT OF THESE IDEAS ARE

04:57:07.042 --> 04:57:09.478
HAPHAZARD. THEY ARE NOT

04:57:09.545 --> 04:57:11.914
COORDINATED. AND THAT'S BEEN

04:57:11.980 --> 04:57:13.315
POINTED OUT BY MY COLLEAGUES ON

04:57:13.382 --> 04:57:16.351
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. AND I'M

04:57:16.418 --> 04:57:18.120
GLAD THAT THAT CONVERSATION IS

04:57:18.187 --> 04:57:24.493
UNDERWAY. CNBC PUBLISHED A AN

04:57:24.560 --> 04:57:26.361
UPDATE TO ITS ANNUAL SURVEY ON

04:57:26.428 --> 04:57:28.497
THE ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS OF

04:57:28.564 --> 04:57:30.299
STATES. CNBC IS NOT A

04:57:30.365 --> 04:57:32.601
CONSERVATIVE OUTLET. IT IT'S

04:57:32.668 --> 04:57:35.437
LEFT LEANING ARGUABLY, BUT I

04:57:35.504 --> 04:57:36.972
LIKE THEIR METHODOLOGY AND THAT

04:57:37.039 --> 04:57:38.440
THEY BROKE DOWN DIFFERENT

04:57:38.507 --> 04:57:40.742
ELEMENTS OF A STATE. AND IN

04:57:40.809 --> 04:57:41.610
CALIFORNIA THEY GAVE US GOOD

04:57:41.677 --> 04:57:43.212
MARKS FOR QUALITY OF LIFE. I

04:57:43.278 --> 04:57:44.646
MEAN, YOU CAN'T BEAT THE

04:57:44.713 --> 04:57:47.416
SUNSHINE. THEY ALSO GAVE US GOOD

04:57:47.482 --> 04:57:48.250
MARKS FOR OUR INNOVATION

04:57:48.317 --> 04:57:53.455
ECONOMY. STRONG MARKS AND BUT

04:57:53.522 --> 04:57:54.856
OVERALL, WE WEREN'T VERY GOOD AS

04:57:54.923 --> 04:57:57.192
AN ECONOMY. BUT IT WAS BECAUSE

04:57:57.259 --> 04:57:59.228
OF THOSE TWO GOOD THINGS THAT WE

04:57:59.294 --> 04:58:00.495
KIND OF PROPPED UP THE OTHER BAD

04:58:00.562 --> 04:58:02.130
NUMBERS, WHICH WAS NUMBER ONE

04:58:02.197 --> 04:58:03.232
COST OF LIVING. WE ARE DEAD

04:58:03.298 --> 04:58:05.601
LAST, THE COST OF OPERATING A

04:58:05.667 --> 04:58:07.936
BUSINESS OR BUSINESS FRIENDLY OR

04:58:08.003 --> 04:58:09.338
UNFRIENDLINESS. IN THE CASE OF

04:58:09.404 --> 04:58:11.039
CALIFORNIA, WE WERE DEAD LAST 48

04:58:11.106 --> 04:58:13.875
OUT OF 50. SO WE'RE REALLY WE'RE

04:58:13.942 --> 04:58:15.477
REALLY COMPETING WITH NEW YORK

04:58:15.544 --> 04:58:17.646
TO MAKE OURSELVES THE MOST

04:58:17.713 --> 04:58:18.914
TOXIC, TOXIC STATE IN THE

04:58:18.981 --> 04:58:22.417
NATION. THE POINT I'M MAKING IS

04:58:22.484 --> 04:58:26.221
I WOULDN'T TRUST SACRAMENTO TO

04:58:26.288 --> 04:58:27.656
REGULATE A LEMONADE STAND AT

04:58:27.723 --> 04:58:30.859
THIS POINT, LET ALONE OUR

04:58:30.926 --> 04:58:32.327
INNOVATION ECONOMY, WHICH IS

04:58:32.394 --> 04:58:34.496
SOMETHING THAT CALIFORNIA HAS

04:58:34.563 --> 04:58:37.432
GOING FOR IT. AGAIN, I DON'T

04:58:37.499 --> 04:58:39.034
WANT TO BE DISPARAGING ABOUT

04:58:39.101 --> 04:58:40.202
INTENT ON THESE THINGS, BECAUSE

04:58:40.269 --> 04:58:42.337
SOME OF THE BILLS THAT WE'VE

04:58:42.404 --> 04:58:44.239
SEEN HAVE GOOD INTENT, BUT THE

04:58:44.306 --> 04:58:45.540
EXECUTION IS FATALLY FLAWED. SO

04:58:45.607 --> 04:58:47.976
I WOULD LIKE JUST TO HAVE A

04:58:48.043 --> 04:58:50.612
MORATORIUM, JUST PUMP THE BRAKES.

04:58:50.679 --> 04:58:55.684
AND I WOULD URGE INDUSTRY TO

04:58:55.751 --> 04:58:56.752
CHANGE YOUR APPROACH BECAUSE IT

04:58:56.818 --> 04:58:58.387
ISN'T WORKING. YOU COMING IN

04:58:58.453 --> 04:59:00.322
WITH RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION. I

04:59:00.389 --> 04:59:01.123
MEAN, WHEN SOMEONE'S ABOUT TO

04:59:01.189 --> 04:59:03.759
DIE, THEY SAY I HAVE RESPECTFUL

04:59:03.825 --> 04:59:04.960
OPPOSITION TO DEATH. WELL, IT'S

04:59:05.027 --> 04:59:07.529
NOT GOING TO CHANGE ANYTHING. I

04:59:07.596 --> 04:59:10.098
WOULD URGE YOU TO STOP THAT

04:59:10.165 --> 04:59:14.670
APPROACH AND INSTEAD TALK TO THE

04:59:14.736 --> 04:59:16.071
AUTHORS ABOUT THEIR INTENT AND

04:59:16.138 --> 04:59:17.673
FIGURE OUT A BETTER,

04:59:17.739 --> 04:59:18.674
PRO-BUSINESS, FREE MARKET

04:59:18.740 --> 04:59:20.142
APPROACH TO DEALING WITH THESE

04:59:20.208 --> 04:59:21.543
THINGS. BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE

04:59:21.610 --> 04:59:22.177
DOING RIGHT NOW ISN'T GOING TO

04:59:22.244 --> 04:59:23.979
WORK. THEY'RE GOING TO PASS BAD

04:59:24.046 --> 04:59:25.380
BILLS. AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE

04:59:25.447 --> 04:59:27.115
SAYING, WELL, WE'RE GOING TO TRY

04:59:27.182 --> 04:59:28.216
TO NIBBLE AROUND THE EDGES, YOU

04:59:28.283 --> 04:59:29.751
KNOW, NIBBLE AROUND THE EDGES

04:59:29.818 --> 04:59:30.852
AND MAKE THINGS BETTER. YOU

04:59:30.919 --> 04:59:32.321
KNOW, MAYBE WE STOP MOST OF THE

04:59:32.387 --> 04:59:34.222
STUFF, BUT MAYBE WE CAN FIX SOME

04:59:34.289 --> 04:59:36.158
OF THE STUFF. I THINK INDUSTRY,

04:59:36.224 --> 04:59:36.725
PARTICULARLY OUR INNOVATION

04:59:36.792 --> 04:59:39.127
ECONOMY, YOU WOULD DO YOURSELVES

04:59:39.194 --> 04:59:40.529
A FAVOR IN GETTING PROACTIVE ON

04:59:40.595 --> 04:59:42.364
SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT ARE

04:59:42.431 --> 04:59:43.765
DRIVING SOME OF THIS REGULATION

04:59:43.832 --> 04:59:45.267
AND COME UP WITH A BETTER

04:59:45.334 --> 04:59:48.103
APPROACH, AND IT PROBABLY WON'T

04:59:48.170 --> 04:59:49.905
SATISFY THE AUTHORS IN ALL

04:59:49.971 --> 04:59:51.506
RESPECTS, BUT IT MIGHT ACTUALLY

04:59:51.573 --> 04:59:53.208
MOVE THE CONVERSATION IN A

04:59:53.275 --> 04:59:54.476
DIRECTION THAT'S THAT'S HEALTHY

04:59:54.543 --> 04:59:56.511
AND PRODUCTIVE. AGAIN, I URGE

04:59:56.578 --> 04:59:57.913
THIS COMMITTEE JUST TO PUMP THE

04:59:57.979 --> 05:00:00.482
BRAKES AND VOTE NO ON ALL THESE

05:00:00.549 --> 05:00:02.317
BILLS. I THINK THAT WE ARE DOING

05:00:02.384 --> 05:00:03.352
GRAVE DAMAGE. WE'VE ALREADY DONE

05:00:03.418 --> 05:00:05.020
GRAVE DAMAGE TO OTHER INDUSTRIES

05:00:05.087 --> 05:00:06.321
OF THE STATE, WHICH IS WHY WE'RE

05:00:06.388 --> 05:00:07.289
NOT A VERY COMPETITIVE STATE

05:00:07.356 --> 05:00:08.757
ANYMORE. WE'RE TOXIC TO

05:00:08.824 --> 05:00:10.692
BUSINESS, BUT THE ONE INDUSTRY

05:00:10.759 --> 05:00:12.060
WHERE WE'RE KIND OF DOING WELL

05:00:12.127 --> 05:00:14.496
BECAUSE OF OUR INNOVATORS. BOY,

05:00:14.563 --> 05:00:16.598
THIS COMMITTEE AND SOME OF THE

05:00:16.665 --> 05:00:17.132
OTHER LEGISLATION WINDING

05:00:17.199 --> 05:00:19.034
THROUGH OTHER COMMITTEES REALLY,

05:00:19.101 --> 05:00:21.336
I THINK PRESENTS A THREAT TO

05:00:21.403 --> 05:00:22.738
THAT, THAT THAT STRENGTH. SO I

05:00:22.804 --> 05:00:24.639
WILL BE VOTING NO. AND I WILL

05:00:24.706 --> 05:00:27.676
SHUT UP ON THE OTHER BILLS.

05:00:27.743 --> 05:00:30.712
THANK YOU. I ACTUALLY REALLY

05:00:30.779 --> 05:00:33.482
APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTARY. FOR

05:00:33.548 --> 05:00:36.385
ONE, WE ARE DEEPLY COMMITTED

05:00:36.451 --> 05:00:37.919
WITH WORKING WITH INDUSTRY. AND

05:00:37.986 --> 05:00:39.287
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE

05:00:39.354 --> 05:00:40.889
INNOVATION ECONOMY, MY DISTRICT

05:00:40.956 --> 05:00:42.557
IN PARTICULAR, FOR EXAMPLE,

05:00:42.624 --> 05:00:44.659
REALLY VALUES RESHORING JOBS

05:00:44.726 --> 05:00:46.528
HERE IN THE BAY AREA IN

05:00:46.595 --> 05:00:49.064
PARTICULAR. IN MY DISTRICT, WE

05:00:49.131 --> 05:00:51.767
HAVE THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF

05:00:51.833 --> 05:00:53.301
MANUFACTURERS THAN IN MY

05:00:53.368 --> 05:00:55.170
DISTRICT THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN

05:00:55.237 --> 05:00:57.672
CALIFORNIA. WE ARE DEEPLY

05:00:57.739 --> 05:01:00.242
COMMITTED TO DIVERSITY. AND, YOU

05:01:00.308 --> 05:01:01.710
KNOW, SOME OF THE OTHER WORDS

05:01:01.777 --> 05:01:05.046
THAT ARE NOT AS APPRECIATED,

05:01:05.113 --> 05:01:06.248
LIKE EQUITY AND INCLUSION AND

05:01:06.314 --> 05:01:08.417
MUCH MORE. THIS PARTICULAR BILL,

05:01:08.483 --> 05:01:10.318
AND I WOULDN'T BE VERY CLEAR

05:01:10.385 --> 05:01:11.887
ABOUT THIS, IS ABOUT PROTECTING

05:01:11.953 --> 05:01:14.956
ALL CALIFORNIANS AND THEIR RIGHT

05:01:15.023 --> 05:01:16.324
TO PRIVACY WHEN THEY DO SIGN UP,

05:01:16.391 --> 05:01:18.593
ASSUMING THAT, HEY, I'M FILLING

05:01:18.660 --> 05:01:20.629
OUT THIS INFORMATION TO UTILIZE

05:01:20.695 --> 05:01:22.864
AN APP OR ANYTHING ELSE, WHETHER

05:01:22.931 --> 05:01:25.700
IT'S EVEN RENTING A CAR, AS I

05:01:25.767 --> 05:01:29.604
TESTIFIED EARLIER, IT'S

05:01:29.671 --> 05:01:30.906
INFORMATION THAT'S BEING SHARED

05:01:30.972 --> 05:01:32.107
THAT SOME PEOPLE DON'T EVEN

05:01:32.174 --> 05:01:33.308
REALIZE IS BEING SOLD OVER AND

05:01:33.375 --> 05:01:35.043
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

05:01:35.110 --> 05:01:37.179
RIGHT. AND SO THE INNOVATION

05:01:37.245 --> 05:01:38.914
ECONOMY AND PROTECTING CONSUMERS

05:01:38.980 --> 05:01:40.849
IS NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. AND I

05:01:40.916 --> 05:01:42.584
THINK THAT THIS BILL DOES JUST

05:01:42.651 --> 05:01:44.553
THAT. IT PROTECTS PEOPLE TO BE

05:01:44.619 --> 05:01:48.089
ABLE TO SAY, HEY, THIS TYPE OF

05:01:48.156 --> 05:01:50.225
INFORMATION, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT

05:01:50.292 --> 05:01:52.260
AS A HUMAN BEING TO BE ABLE TO

05:01:52.327 --> 05:01:53.562
DELETE AND SAY, THIS IS

05:01:53.628 --> 05:01:54.496
PERSONAL, SENSITIVE INFORMATION

05:01:54.563 --> 05:01:55.997
THAT I DON'T WANT SHARED WITH

05:01:56.064 --> 05:01:57.365
EVERY SINGLE PERSON. I DON'T

05:01:57.432 --> 05:02:00.735
WANT THINGS PROJECTED TO ME AND

05:02:00.802 --> 05:02:03.271
SHARED IN QUESTIONABLE WAYS AS,

05:02:03.338 --> 05:02:05.707
AS WE'VE DISCUSSED BEFORE. AND

05:02:05.774 --> 05:02:07.342
AT THE SAME TIME, IT ALSO

05:02:07.409 --> 05:02:09.678
DOESN'T LIMIT INNOVATION IN ANY

05:02:09.744 --> 05:02:11.746
WAY. IT JUST SAYS, HEY, THIS

05:02:11.813 --> 05:02:13.515
INFORMATION SHOULD NOT BE

05:02:13.582 --> 05:02:15.884
UTILIZED IN ANY DISCRIMINATION

05:02:15.951 --> 05:02:17.486
IN ANY WAY THAT WOULD HARM

05:02:17.552 --> 05:02:19.054
SOMEBODY AND MUCH MORE. AND WE

05:02:19.120 --> 05:02:20.055
ARE DEEPLY COMMITTED WITH

05:02:20.121 --> 05:02:22.457
WORKING WITH THE CHAMBER ON

05:02:22.524 --> 05:02:24.726
THREADING THAT NEEDLE AND MAKING

05:02:24.793 --> 05:02:27.429
GOOD POLICY FOR THE STATE OF

05:02:27.496 --> 05:02:28.897
CALIFORNIA. SO WE ARE COMMITTED

05:02:28.964 --> 05:02:34.369
TO THAT. THANK YOU, SENATOR.

05:02:34.436 --> 05:02:36.037
SEEING NOBODY ELSE WANTING TO

05:02:36.104 --> 05:02:38.707
CHIME IN, I THINK I WILL SAY

05:02:38.773 --> 05:02:43.545
THAT I BELIEVE THIS IS ONE OF

05:02:43.612 --> 05:02:44.679
THE MOST NONPARTIZAN I'LL CALL

05:02:44.746 --> 05:02:47.115
IT NONPARTISAN COMMITTEES IN THE

05:02:47.182 --> 05:02:49.284
LEGISLATURE. I THINK PRIVACY

05:02:49.351 --> 05:02:50.719
FUNDAMENTALLY IS A SHARED VALUE

05:02:50.785 --> 05:02:52.454
AMONGST BOTH DEMOCRATS,

05:02:52.521 --> 05:02:53.655
REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS ALIKE.

05:02:53.722 --> 05:02:55.257
WE ALL BELIEVE WE HAVE A RIGHT

05:02:55.323 --> 05:02:56.458
TO CONTROL OUR PRIVATE

05:02:56.525 --> 05:02:57.592
INFORMATION AND THAT WE DON'T

05:02:57.659 --> 05:03:00.328
WANT IT SPREAD AROUND WILLY

05:03:00.395 --> 05:03:02.130
NILLY WITHOUT SOME POWER TO

05:03:02.197 --> 05:03:07.269
CONTROL IT. AND. I THINK I'M

05:03:07.335 --> 05:03:09.371
GOING TO TAKE A MOMENT TO JUST

05:03:09.437 --> 05:03:10.438
GIVE AMAZING KUDOS TO THE STAFF

05:03:10.505 --> 05:03:12.007
AT THIS COMMITTEE THAT WORKS

05:03:12.073 --> 05:03:13.875
INCREDIBLY HARD TO PROTECT OUR

05:03:13.942 --> 05:03:15.877
INNOVATION ECONOMY AND ALSO

05:03:15.944 --> 05:03:18.013
PROTECT THE VALUES THAT WE ALL

05:03:18.079 --> 05:03:19.514
SHARE. AND I THINK THAT THE

05:03:19.581 --> 05:03:21.349
PROOF IS IN THE PUDDING THAT WE

05:03:21.416 --> 05:03:23.552
ARE SUCCEEDING IN DOING THAT,

05:03:23.618 --> 05:03:24.185
BECAUSE OUR INNOVATION ECONOMY

05:03:24.252 --> 05:03:25.453
IS THRIVING. WE ARE THE CAPITAL

05:03:25.520 --> 05:03:27.722
OF AI. WE ARE WHERE THE NEXT

05:03:27.789 --> 05:03:29.057
GENERATION OF TECHNOLOGY IS

05:03:29.124 --> 05:03:32.527
BEING INVENTED. AND OBVIOUSLY

05:03:32.594 --> 05:03:34.195
THAT IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO

05:03:34.262 --> 05:03:35.397
REMAIN COGNIZANT OF AT ALL

05:03:35.463 --> 05:03:37.299
TIMES. I, LIKE THE SENATOR,

05:03:37.365 --> 05:03:39.200
REPRESENT MANY OF THE TECH

05:03:39.267 --> 05:03:41.870
WORKERS IN SILICON VALLEY. BOTH

05:03:41.937 --> 05:03:43.238
OF US HAVE SUPERCOMPUTERS, SO WE

05:03:43.305 --> 05:03:44.506
MAY NOT REPRESENT THE COMPANIES,

05:03:44.573 --> 05:03:46.775
BUT WE REPRESENT THE WORKERS.

05:03:46.841 --> 05:03:49.311
AND SO THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT

05:03:49.377 --> 05:03:51.212
WE ARE FRIENDS WITH THAT WE HANG

05:03:51.279 --> 05:03:53.014
OUT WITH. THAT'S THEIR JOBS. AND

05:03:53.081 --> 05:03:55.050
WE BELIEVE DEEPLY THAT THOSE

05:03:55.116 --> 05:03:57.018
JOBS ARE CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS

05:03:57.085 --> 05:03:58.486
OF THIS STATE, OF THE ECONOMY,

05:03:58.553 --> 05:04:00.021
OF EVERYTHING. BUT THAT DOESN'T

05:04:00.088 --> 05:04:01.656
MEAN WE HAVE TO SACRIFICE

05:04:01.723 --> 05:04:04.793
PRIVACY. AND I THINK THAT WE'VE

05:04:04.859 --> 05:04:06.361
PROVEN THAT. AND I THINK WE

05:04:06.428 --> 05:04:07.495
CONTINUE TO PROVE THAT IN THIS

05:04:07.562 --> 05:04:11.333
BILL IS, YOU KNOW, IN ITS FIRST

05:04:11.399 --> 05:04:13.435
COMMITTEE. AND I TRUST THE

05:04:13.501 --> 05:04:14.936
AUTHOR TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON

05:04:15.003 --> 05:04:16.938
IT. BUT I THINK THE GOALS SHE

05:04:17.005 --> 05:04:18.139
HAS ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT.

05:04:18.206 --> 05:04:22.077
AND I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, SHE

05:04:22.143 --> 05:04:23.111
WILL REMAIN IN CONVERSATION

05:04:23.178 --> 05:04:24.980
ABOUT HOW TO ACHIEVE THOSE. BUT

05:04:25.046 --> 05:04:27.682
I THINK YOU CAN SEE BY THE FACT

05:04:27.749 --> 05:04:28.883
THAT IT'S, YOU KNOW, A VERY

05:04:28.950 --> 05:04:30.318
SURGICAL CHANGE THAT SHE'S

05:04:30.385 --> 05:04:31.686
TRYING TO THREAD A NEEDLE,

05:04:31.753 --> 05:04:32.287
WHETHER SHE SUCCEEDED IN THE

05:04:32.354 --> 05:04:33.989
FIRST COMMITTEE OR NOT WILL BE,

05:04:34.055 --> 05:04:35.924
YOU KNOW, OFTEN THE ANSWER TO

05:04:35.991 --> 05:04:38.259
THAT IS NO, NOT AS A DIG TO THE

05:04:38.326 --> 05:04:40.228
AUTHOR, JUST GENERALLY THE

05:04:40.295 --> 05:04:41.129
REALITY OF THE LEGISLATIVE

05:04:41.196 --> 05:04:42.263
PROCESS. AND I KNOW THAT THIS

05:04:42.330 --> 05:04:44.532
COMMITTEE AND THE CONSULTANT WHO

05:04:44.599 --> 05:04:46.568
HAS WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THE

05:04:46.635 --> 05:04:47.869
SENATOR'S OFFICE ON THIS

05:04:47.936 --> 05:04:49.537
PROPOSAL, WILL CONTINUE TO HELP

05:04:49.604 --> 05:04:50.705
SUPPORT THE SENATOR IN ACHIEVING

05:04:50.772 --> 05:04:51.673
HER GOAL OF PROTECTING

05:04:51.740 --> 05:04:53.441
CALIFORNIANS RIGHT NOW WHO ARE

05:04:53.508 --> 05:04:55.610
BOTH AFRAID AND INCREDIBLY

05:04:55.677 --> 05:04:56.611
VULNERABLE. AND I THINK I

05:04:56.678 --> 05:04:57.712
APPRECIATE THE CHAMBER COMING

05:04:57.779 --> 05:05:00.248
OUT PUBLICLY WITH A STATEMENT

05:05:00.315 --> 05:05:03.818
THAT SUPPORTS CALIFORNIANS AND

05:05:03.885 --> 05:05:06.021
TALKS ABOUT WHY WHAT IS

05:05:06.087 --> 05:05:07.255
HAPPENING IN OUR GREAT STATE

05:05:07.322 --> 05:05:08.890
RIGHT NOW IS NOT BENEFICIAL TO

05:05:08.957 --> 05:05:11.026
ANYBODY. AND SO, YOU KNOW, I

05:05:11.092 --> 05:05:12.427
HOPE THAT TOGETHER, WE CAN MOVE

05:05:12.494 --> 05:05:13.928
FORWARD IN A WAY THAT PROTECTS

05:05:13.995 --> 05:05:15.797
PEOPLE FROM THIS INFORMATION

05:05:15.864 --> 05:05:18.366
BEING SO EASILY AVAILABLE, WHICH

05:05:18.433 --> 05:05:20.702
IT JUST IS TODAY. AND THAT'S

05:05:20.769 --> 05:05:23.905
PROBLEMATIC. SO WITH THAT Þ.

05:05:23.972 --> 05:05:25.740
SURE. YES. THAT'S ALL. THAT'S

05:05:25.807 --> 05:05:27.375
OKAY. MADAM VICE CHAIR. IT'S

05:05:27.442 --> 05:05:29.377
MORE OF A MORE OF A MACRO

05:05:29.444 --> 05:05:31.212
STATEMENT JUST ABOUT IMPORTANCE

05:05:31.279 --> 05:05:33.815
OF THIS INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA,

05:05:33.882 --> 05:05:35.617
MAYBE NOT SPECIFICALLY TO THIS

05:05:35.684 --> 05:05:37.619
BILL. I JUST IF I'M SITTING HERE

05:05:37.686 --> 05:05:39.487
LISTENING TO THE PRIVACY

05:05:39.554 --> 05:05:40.555
ARGUMENT, WHICH OF COURSE, WE

05:05:40.622 --> 05:05:43.892
ALL RESPECT, BUT INFORMATION IS

05:05:43.958 --> 05:05:46.461
OUT THERE. I MEAN, PEOPLE ARE

05:05:46.528 --> 05:05:47.696
WHETHER IT'S FACEBOOK, IT'S BEEN

05:05:47.762 --> 05:05:49.097
GOING ON, PEOPLE KNOW THEIR

05:05:49.164 --> 05:05:50.298
BIRTHDAY. I MEAN, OTHER PEOPLE,

05:05:50.365 --> 05:05:54.602
CAN THEY JUST COMB FACEBOOK AND

05:05:54.669 --> 05:05:57.272
ALL THE SOCIAL MEDIA SITES THAT

05:05:57.338 --> 05:05:58.940
YOU HAVE TO? WE'VE ALL BECOME

05:05:59.007 --> 05:06:01.042
MORE I HAVE ALARMED TO WHAT

05:06:01.109 --> 05:06:02.243
INFORMATION IS OUT THERE,

05:06:02.310 --> 05:06:03.778
WHETHER YOU'RE TAKING PICTURES

05:06:03.845 --> 05:06:05.447
OF BEING ON VACATION. OOPS, YOU

05:06:05.513 --> 05:06:06.748
BETTER NOT DO THAT. SOMEBODY

05:06:06.815 --> 05:06:07.982
KNOWS YOU'RE NOT HOME. SO, I

05:06:08.049 --> 05:06:10.151
MEAN, WE ALL HAVE TO BE

05:06:10.218 --> 05:06:11.152
COGNIZANT OF WHAT'S GOING ON

05:06:11.219 --> 05:06:12.320
THERE. AT THE SAME TIME, I THINK

05:06:12.387 --> 05:06:14.222
I'M SPEAKING ABOUT PERSONAL

05:06:14.289 --> 05:06:14.989
RESPONSIBILITY AND PROTECTING

05:06:15.056 --> 05:06:17.792
THAT INFORMATION. I MEAN, WHEN I

05:06:17.859 --> 05:06:19.360
CALL MY OWN BANK, IF YOU GET

05:06:19.427 --> 05:06:21.196
THROUGH TO A BANK, YOU GO

05:06:21.262 --> 05:06:22.831
THROUGH SEVERAL STEPS TO

05:06:22.897 --> 05:06:24.432
IDENTIFY YOURSELF, WHICH I TRUST

05:06:24.499 --> 05:06:28.670
THE BANK. SO WE HAVE TO WE'RE

05:06:28.737 --> 05:06:33.174
SELF COMMUNICATING OUR OWN LAST

05:06:33.241 --> 05:06:34.275
FOUR DIGITS OF OUR SOCIAL

05:06:34.342 --> 05:06:35.443
SECURITY NUMBER. I MEAN, YOU

05:06:35.510 --> 05:06:37.112
JUST KIND OF THINK, SHOULD I

05:06:37.178 --> 05:06:38.980
REALLY DO THIS? SO WE ALL HAVE

05:06:39.047 --> 05:06:40.782
TO BE I WAS SPEAKING ABOUT

05:06:40.849 --> 05:06:42.083
PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AS WELL.

05:06:42.150 --> 05:06:46.421
ALSO ON A MACRO SENSE ABOUT THE

05:06:46.488 --> 05:06:48.223
SILICON VALLEY BUSINESSES, OUR

05:06:48.289 --> 05:06:49.624
INNOVATION BUSINESS. WE TALK

05:06:49.691 --> 05:06:53.828
ABOUT AI. WELL, CALIFORNIA ISN'T

05:06:53.895 --> 05:06:55.663
WHERE IT'S ALL AT. I MEAN, YOU

05:06:55.730 --> 05:06:58.032
READ THE NEWS AS I DO. TEXAS IS

05:06:58.099 --> 05:06:59.734
WELCOMING THESE COMPANIES.

05:06:59.801 --> 05:07:01.536
YESTERDAY, A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT IN

05:07:01.603 --> 05:07:03.404
PENNSYLVANIA WHERE AI IS GOING

05:07:03.471 --> 05:07:04.439
TO BE HEADQUARTERED AND NEVADA

05:07:04.506 --> 05:07:09.444
HAS ALL THESE. COMPUTER DATA

05:07:09.511 --> 05:07:11.412
CENTERS, AI CENTERS. SO I DON'T

05:07:11.479 --> 05:07:15.383
THINK WE SHOULD BE IGNORE THE

05:07:15.450 --> 05:07:17.051
FACT THAT CALIFORNIA REALLY MAY

05:07:17.118 --> 05:07:19.254
NOT ALWAYS BE THE BE ALL TO END

05:07:19.320 --> 05:07:21.022
ALL. WE HAVE TO DO WHATEVER WE

05:07:21.089 --> 05:07:22.457
CAN TO PROTECT OUR PRIVACY,

05:07:22.524 --> 05:07:23.992
PROTECT OUR BUSINESSES, AND MAKE

05:07:24.058 --> 05:07:25.760
SURE THAT WE'RE NOT MAKING IT SO

05:07:25.827 --> 05:07:27.495
DIFFICULT TO DO BUSINESS IN

05:07:27.562 --> 05:07:28.429
CALIFORNIA THAT THE PEOPLE WE

05:07:28.496 --> 05:07:31.099
WANT TO PROTECT ARE NOT GOING TO

05:07:31.166 --> 05:07:33.001
WANT TO LIVE HERE ANYMORE. SO I

05:07:33.067 --> 05:07:34.736
THINK WE HAVE PERSONAL

05:07:34.803 --> 05:07:35.370
RESPONSIBILITY AS PART OF MY

05:07:35.436 --> 05:07:37.238
POINT, AND ALSO BE COGNIZANT OF

05:07:37.305 --> 05:07:39.641
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE REST OF

05:07:39.707 --> 05:07:41.009
THE COUNTRY MAKING THEMSELVES. I

05:07:41.075 --> 05:07:42.310
MEAN, IT'S WELL KNOWN CALIFORNIA

05:07:42.377 --> 05:07:44.445
OVER LITIGATES, OVER TAXES AND

05:07:44.512 --> 05:07:46.114
OVER REGULATES. AND IF THAT'S

05:07:46.181 --> 05:07:48.483
THE IF THAT'S THE REPUTATION

05:07:48.550 --> 05:07:50.585
CALIFORNIA WANTS, WE'RE GOING TO

05:07:50.652 --> 05:07:52.387
BE A PROBLEM FROM AN ECONOMIC

05:07:52.453 --> 05:07:54.189
STANDPOINT GOING FORWARD. BUT I

05:07:54.255 --> 05:07:57.058
DIGRESS. BUT ANYWAY, SO BACK TO

05:07:57.125 --> 05:07:59.060
BACK TO THE SUBJECT AT HAND,

05:07:59.127 --> 05:08:01.129
WHEN I WAS GOING TO SAY THAT THE

05:08:01.196 --> 05:08:02.130
OPPOSITION WITNESS WAS ACTUALLY

05:08:02.197 --> 05:08:03.598
WORKING FOR THIS COMMITTEE WHEN

05:08:03.665 --> 05:08:07.535
THE CCPA WAS DRAFTED, AND I

05:08:07.602 --> 05:08:09.671
THINK THAT NOW IT'S GOT IT WAS

05:08:09.737 --> 05:08:11.372
FOR MY TIME AND I'VE BEEN AROUND

05:08:11.439 --> 05:08:12.473
ALMOST SEVEN YEARS. SO WHAT,

05:08:12.540 --> 05:08:14.642
EIGHT YEARS AGO, PROBABLY ISH

05:08:14.709 --> 05:08:16.411
WAS WHEN THE BILL CAME TO PASS

05:08:16.477 --> 05:08:18.746
AND THE SKY HAS NOT FALLEN. AND

05:08:18.813 --> 05:08:20.281
I THINK THAT IT IS THE ARTFUL

05:08:20.348 --> 05:08:21.716
WAY THAT IT DOES EMPOWER

05:08:21.783 --> 05:08:22.951
CONSUMERS. RIGHT? I MEAN, THAT

05:08:23.017 --> 05:08:24.719
IS THE WAY THE CCPA WORKS

05:08:24.786 --> 05:08:26.287
SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW, AN OPT IN

05:08:26.354 --> 05:08:28.189
IS HARD TO GET PEOPLE TO DO.

05:08:28.256 --> 05:08:30.959
BUT, YOU KNOW, I THINK AND

05:08:31.025 --> 05:08:32.126
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

05:08:32.193 --> 05:08:33.061
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHEN DO WE

05:08:33.127 --> 05:08:36.464
HAVE OPT IN, WHEN DO WE HAVE OPT

05:08:36.531 --> 05:08:36.965
OUT? WHAT IS SENSITIVE

05:08:37.031 --> 05:08:37.565
INFORMATION THAT HAS CHANGED?

05:08:37.632 --> 05:08:38.299
RIGHT. WHEN THIS BILL WAS

05:08:38.366 --> 05:08:40.368
PASSED, WE WERE IN A VERY

05:08:40.435 --> 05:08:41.436
DIFFERENT ABORTION LANDSCAPE,

05:08:41.502 --> 05:08:42.337
FOR EXAMPLE, THAN WE ARE TODAY.

05:08:42.403 --> 05:08:43.471
THAT INFORMATION, ALTHOUGH

05:08:43.538 --> 05:08:44.672
ALWAYS SENSITIVE BECAUSE IT'S

05:08:44.739 --> 05:08:45.506
HEALTH INFORMATION, WASN'T

05:08:45.573 --> 05:08:47.242
VIEWED IN THE SAME LIGHT EIGHT

05:08:47.308 --> 05:08:49.377
YEARS AGO AS IT IS TODAY. AND SO

05:08:49.444 --> 05:08:52.480
WE HAVE TO BE COGNIZANT OF BOTH

05:08:52.547 --> 05:08:55.383
GOOD LAW AND CHANGING DYNAMICS.

05:08:55.450 --> 05:08:56.851
YOU WANTED TO RESPOND TO

05:08:56.918 --> 05:08:57.952
SOMETHING, MAY I PLEASE, JUST

05:08:58.019 --> 05:08:59.554
BECAUSE IT WAS TALKED ABOUT, THE

05:08:59.621 --> 05:09:01.990
OPPOSITION IN OUR POSITION ON

05:09:02.056 --> 05:09:03.091
THIS AND HOW WE SHOULD MOVE

05:09:03.157 --> 05:09:05.026
FORWARD. IF I CAN TAKE A MINUTE.

05:09:05.093 --> 05:09:06.494
THANK YOU. SO I JUST A COUPLE OF

05:09:06.561 --> 05:09:08.062
THINGS AND I APPRECIATE YOUR

05:09:08.129 --> 05:09:09.931
REMARKS. YOU KNOW, WE I WANT TO

05:09:09.998 --> 05:09:10.832
THERE'S BEEN A COUPLE COMMENTS

05:09:10.899 --> 05:09:13.034
MADE I FEEL LIKE IN THE LAST 24

05:09:13.101 --> 05:09:14.369
HOURS, MAYBE THIS IS A LITTLE

05:09:14.435 --> 05:09:15.937
BIT ON MY MIND ABOUT THE

05:09:16.004 --> 05:09:16.938
RESPECTFULLY COMMENTS. WE SAY

05:09:17.005 --> 05:09:18.273
RESPECTFULLY, BECAUSE THERE'S A

05:09:18.339 --> 05:09:20.275
LOT OF RESPECT FROM THOSE OF US

05:09:20.341 --> 05:09:20.875
WHO WORK, HAVE WORKED IN THE

05:09:20.942 --> 05:09:23.177
BUILDING, WORK OUTSIDE THE

05:09:23.244 --> 05:09:23.778
BUILDING FOR THIS PROCESS AND

05:09:23.845 --> 05:09:24.479
THIS BUILDING AND FOR THE

05:09:24.545 --> 05:09:26.481
MEMBERS AND THE AUTHORS. AND SO

05:09:26.547 --> 05:09:28.182
IT COMES WITH THAT, EVEN IF WE

05:09:28.249 --> 05:09:29.918
ARE OPPOSED TO SOMETHING. AND I

05:09:29.984 --> 05:09:30.885
DON'T THINK THAT MEANS THAT OUR

05:09:30.952 --> 05:09:32.320
OPPOSITION IS ANY LESS FERVENT,

05:09:32.387 --> 05:09:33.354
WE CAN VEHEMENTLY OPPOSE

05:09:33.421 --> 05:09:34.989
SOMETHING AND STILL WANT TO BE

05:09:35.056 --> 05:09:36.491
AT THE TABLE AND WANT TO HAVE

05:09:36.557 --> 05:09:38.226
CONVERSATIONS. WE CAN THINK THIS

05:09:38.293 --> 05:09:39.060
IS VERY MUCH THE WRONG APPROACH

05:09:39.127 --> 05:09:40.161
TO TAKE AND SAY THAT WE'RE

05:09:40.228 --> 05:09:41.229
WILLING TO HAVE THE

05:09:41.296 --> 05:09:42.363
CONVERSATIONS, AND THAT'S THE

05:09:42.430 --> 05:09:43.898
SITUATION WE'RE IN WITH THIS

05:09:43.965 --> 05:09:45.533
BILL. YOU KNOW, AGAIN, THIS

05:09:45.600 --> 05:09:46.234
ISSUE HAS BEEN DECIDED THREE

05:09:46.301 --> 05:09:47.902
TIMES NOW, TWICE BY THE

05:09:47.969 --> 05:09:49.437
LEGISLATURE, ONCE BY VOTERS. WE

05:09:49.504 --> 05:09:50.138
DISAGREE COMPLETELY THAT THE

05:09:50.204 --> 05:09:51.539
RIGHT APPROACH TO TAKE IS TO

05:09:51.606 --> 05:09:52.907
EXCLUDE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE

05:09:52.974 --> 05:09:54.542
INFORMATION. I THINK WE'RE BEING

05:09:54.609 --> 05:09:55.510
ABSOLUTELY CLEAR ON THAT IN OUR

05:09:55.576 --> 05:09:57.679
LETTER AND OUR POSITION AND OUR

05:09:57.745 --> 05:09:58.313
COMMENTARY. WE'RE BEING

05:09:58.379 --> 05:09:59.280
ABSOLUTELY CLEAR. BUT I THINK WE

05:09:59.347 --> 05:10:01.849
CAN RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE

05:10:01.916 --> 05:10:02.450
BROADER THINGS THAT ARE BEING

05:10:02.517 --> 05:10:04.252
DISCUSSED, AND WE CAN BE PART OF

05:10:04.319 --> 05:10:05.186
A SOLUTION TO THINGS WITHOUT

05:10:05.253 --> 05:10:06.521
DOING HARM TO OUR INNOVATION

05:10:06.587 --> 05:10:08.690
ECONOMY. I DON'T THINK ANYONE

05:10:08.756 --> 05:10:09.390
CAN ACCUSE CAL CHAMBER OF TRYING

05:10:09.457 --> 05:10:10.291
TO JUST BE LACKADAISICAL ABOUT

05:10:10.358 --> 05:10:12.193
WHAT MIGHT BE HAPPENING TO OUR

05:10:12.260 --> 05:10:13.161
INNOVATION ECONOMY AND TO OUR

05:10:13.227 --> 05:10:14.796
SMALL BUSINESSES AND TO OUR

05:10:14.862 --> 05:10:15.430
LARGER BUSINESSES, WHICHEVER MAY

05:10:15.496 --> 05:10:17.165
BE ANY SIZE IN BETWEEN. SO I

05:10:17.231 --> 05:10:19.801
JUST I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR, WE

05:10:19.867 --> 05:10:21.402
APPRECIATE THE SUGGESTIONS. WE

05:10:21.469 --> 05:10:23.171
TAKE THEM TO HEART. WE WILL OF

05:10:23.237 --> 05:10:24.505
COURSE CONSIDER THEM. BUT AGAIN,

05:10:24.572 --> 05:10:26.107
WHEN WE SAY WE ARE WILLING TO

05:10:26.174 --> 05:10:27.508
WORK, IT'S NOT BECAUSE WE ARE

05:10:27.575 --> 05:10:29.177
TRYING TO FIX AND PUT A BAND-AID

05:10:29.243 --> 05:10:30.778
ON SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T WORK.

05:10:30.845 --> 05:10:32.246
THIS THIS DOESN'T WORK FOR US.

05:10:32.313 --> 05:10:34.415
WE'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR ABOUT

05:10:34.482 --> 05:10:35.683
THAT, BUT WE ARE VERY MUCH STILL

05:10:35.750 --> 05:10:36.651
WILLING TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS

05:10:36.718 --> 05:10:37.952
WITH AUTHORS AND BE GOOD

05:10:38.019 --> 05:10:38.486
PARTNERS WHERE WE CAN. IF

05:10:38.553 --> 05:10:40.888
THERE'S A PLACE TO GET TO. YES,

05:10:40.955 --> 05:10:42.590
WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE THOSE

05:10:42.657 --> 05:10:43.558
CONVERSATIONS AND TRY TO GET

05:10:43.624 --> 05:10:44.959
THERE WHERE THAT'S THE RIGHT

05:10:45.026 --> 05:10:48.062
THING TO DO. THANK YOU. SO, I

05:10:48.129 --> 05:10:49.998
MEAN, I DO THINK AND I WILL SAY,

05:10:50.064 --> 05:10:52.166
THE ONE THING THAT I APPRECIATE

05:10:52.233 --> 05:10:53.167
ABOUT WHAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN

05:10:53.234 --> 05:10:56.337
DIEGO SAID IS THAT I ALWAYS

05:10:56.404 --> 05:10:58.239
THINK WHEN I FIRST LOOK AT A

05:10:58.306 --> 05:10:59.807
BILL, WHAT IS THE AUTHOR TRYING

05:10:59.874 --> 05:11:01.442
TO ACHIEVE? LIKE WHEN NO MATTER

05:11:01.509 --> 05:11:04.078
WHO AGAIN, REPUBLICAN, DEMOCRAT,

05:11:04.145 --> 05:11:05.179
WHEN SOMEBODY BRINGS A BILL,

05:11:05.246 --> 05:11:06.514
THEY'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE

05:11:06.581 --> 05:11:07.615
SOMETHING THAT THEY THINK

05:11:07.682 --> 05:11:09.217
IMPROVES THE LIVES FOR SOME

05:11:09.283 --> 05:11:10.985
SEGMENT OF CALIFORNIA. WHAT IS

05:11:11.052 --> 05:11:14.088
THAT? AND I THINK HERE THE

05:11:14.155 --> 05:11:15.556
AUTHOR IS BEING INCREDIBLY

05:11:15.623 --> 05:11:16.724
TRANSPARENT ABOUT WHAT SHE'S

05:11:16.791 --> 05:11:19.427
TRYING TO ACHIEVE FOR

05:11:19.494 --> 05:11:22.764
CALIFORNIANS. AND I, YOU KNOW,

05:11:22.830 --> 05:11:29.037
SO PART OF WHAT I THINK THE

05:11:29.103 --> 05:11:30.405
ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM SAN DIEGO

05:11:30.471 --> 05:11:32.373
WAS SAYING WAS COME TO THE TABLE

05:11:32.440 --> 05:11:33.207
WITH SOLUTIONS TO THOSE PROBLEMS

05:11:33.274 --> 05:11:34.275
AND THEY MIGHT BE DIFFERENT

05:11:34.342 --> 05:11:35.410
SOLUTIONS. AND OFTEN WE'LL SEE

05:11:35.476 --> 05:11:37.078
THROUGH THE PROCESS. AND THIS

05:11:37.145 --> 05:11:38.279
HAPPENS ACTUALLY OFTEN IN THIS

05:11:38.346 --> 05:11:39.881
COMMITTEE WHERE WE TAKE A

05:11:39.947 --> 05:11:40.848
TOTALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTION WITH

05:11:40.915 --> 05:11:42.383
AN AUTHOR, BUT THEIR GOAL IS

05:11:42.450 --> 05:11:43.351
STILL ACHIEVED. AND I THINK THAT

05:11:43.418 --> 05:11:45.019
MOST AUTHORS ARE OPEN TO THAT

05:11:45.086 --> 05:11:47.021
BECAUSE THEY COME IN WANTING TO

05:11:47.088 --> 05:11:48.523
FIX A PROBLEM AND THEY COME UP

05:11:48.589 --> 05:11:50.024
WITH ONE WAY, BUT IF THERE'S A

05:11:50.091 --> 05:11:52.193
DIFFERENT WAY TO DO IT, THEY'RE

05:11:52.260 --> 05:11:53.194
OPEN TO THAT. AND I, YOU KNOW,

05:11:53.261 --> 05:11:54.228
I, I WON'T SPEAK FOR THE

05:11:54.295 --> 05:11:56.264
SENATOR, BUT I KNOW IN MY

05:11:56.330 --> 05:11:58.066
EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH HER OVER

05:11:58.132 --> 05:11:59.667
THE YEARS THAT SHE IS SOMEONE

05:11:59.734 --> 05:12:00.802
WHO WILL HAVE CONVERSATIONS AND

05:12:00.868 --> 05:12:02.236
LISTEN AND REALLY IS HERE TO

05:12:02.303 --> 05:12:03.204
PROTECT THE PEOPLE AND DO THE

05:12:03.271 --> 05:12:04.305
MOST GOOD FOR THE MOST PEOPLE.

05:12:04.372 --> 05:12:06.574
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY,

05:12:06.641 --> 05:12:08.209
WHETHER THIS IS THE BEST

05:12:08.276 --> 05:12:09.010
APPROACH AND IT'S THE ONE WE

05:12:09.077 --> 05:12:10.945
HAVE TODAY AND IT'S A STRONG

05:12:11.012 --> 05:12:12.046
ONE, YOU KNOW, I'M SURE SHE'S

05:12:12.113 --> 05:12:13.314
WILLING TO LISTEN TO WHAT PEOPLE

05:12:13.381 --> 05:12:16.150
HAVE TO SAY WITH THAT. WOULD YOU

05:12:16.217 --> 05:12:17.218
LIKE TO CLOSE? YES. FIRST AND

05:12:17.285 --> 05:12:19.554
FOREMOST, I REALLY DO APPRECIATE

05:12:19.620 --> 05:12:20.855
EVERYBODY'S COMMENTARY ON THIS

05:12:20.922 --> 05:12:22.290
PARTICULAR BILL AND ALSO JUST

05:12:22.356 --> 05:12:25.693
THE STATE OF OUR STATE AND WHAT

05:12:25.760 --> 05:12:28.596
OUR ECONOMY IS AND THE RIGHTS OF

05:12:28.663 --> 05:12:31.365
PEOPLE. I FULLY AGREE, ACTUALLY,

05:12:31.432 --> 05:12:33.167
WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER

05:12:33.234 --> 05:12:36.537
SIDE, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE

05:12:36.604 --> 05:12:37.405
BIGGEST FRUSTRATIONS IN THIS

05:12:37.472 --> 05:12:38.973
BUILDING SOMETIMES IS THAT

05:12:39.040 --> 05:12:40.808
STAKEHOLDERS TEND TO BE VERY

05:12:40.875 --> 05:12:42.310
DEFENSIVE RATHER THAN PROACTIVE

05:12:42.376 --> 05:12:45.446
AS TO HOW CAN WE REALLY ADDRESS

05:12:45.513 --> 05:12:47.281
ISSUES THAT AFFECT 40 MILLION

05:12:47.348 --> 05:12:49.283
PEOPLE. AND THE REALITY IS

05:12:49.350 --> 05:12:50.885
SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW, THEY ALWAYS

05:12:50.952 --> 05:12:52.386
SAY THAT THIS BUILDING IS BUILT

05:12:52.453 --> 05:12:54.055
AND DESIGNED TO MAKE INCREMENTAL

05:12:54.122 --> 05:12:57.258
CHANGE RATHER THAN A OVERHAUL

05:12:57.325 --> 05:12:59.260
SOMETIMES. AND I THINK THAT WHEN

05:12:59.327 --> 05:13:00.595
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE BILLS

05:13:00.661 --> 05:13:03.564
THAT WERE REFERENCED, AS WELL AS

05:13:03.631 --> 05:13:04.899
THE PROPOSITION THAT WAS

05:13:04.966 --> 05:13:06.067
REFERENCED, AGAIN, I WILL SAY

05:13:06.134 --> 05:13:08.136
THAT THAT WAS THE FLOOR THAT WAS

05:13:08.202 --> 05:13:09.904
THE MOST BASIC STANDARD

05:13:09.971 --> 05:13:11.205
FOUNDATION THAT WE CAN HAVE IN

05:13:11.272 --> 05:13:12.473
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, AND

05:13:12.540 --> 05:13:14.342
EVEN THE REFERENCES TO THE BANKS

05:13:14.408 --> 05:13:16.777
AND MUCH MORE. IT IS BECAUSE WE

05:13:16.844 --> 05:13:18.146
HAD THOSE SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE,

05:13:18.212 --> 05:13:19.947
EVEN AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL, WHERE

05:13:20.014 --> 05:13:22.550
OUR INFORMATION REGARDING OUR

05:13:22.617 --> 05:13:24.552
EDUCATION IS PROTECTED. OUR

05:13:24.619 --> 05:13:26.420
INFORMATION IN BANKING

05:13:26.487 --> 05:13:28.689
INSTITUTIONS IS PROTECTED, AND

05:13:28.756 --> 05:13:30.057
MUCH MORE, BECAUSE WE SAID THAT

05:13:30.124 --> 05:13:31.859
THE INDUSTRY HAS A

05:13:31.926 --> 05:13:33.127
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT THIS

05:13:33.194 --> 05:13:35.329
TYPE OF INFORMATION FROM, YOU

05:13:35.396 --> 05:13:37.098
KNOW, BEING IN THE HANDS OF

05:13:37.165 --> 05:13:38.866
PEOPLE THAT WOULD TARGET PEOPLE

05:13:38.933 --> 05:13:40.801
IN A NEGATIVE WAY, IN A

05:13:40.868 --> 05:13:42.703
DISCRIMINATORY WAY, WHETHER IT'S

05:13:42.770 --> 05:13:44.038
FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY, WHETHER

05:13:44.105 --> 05:13:46.207
IT'S, YOU KNOW, UTILIZING

05:13:46.274 --> 05:13:47.375
PEOPLE'S SOCIAL SECURITY,

05:13:47.441 --> 05:13:48.910
WHETHER IT'S, YOU KNOW,

05:13:48.976 --> 05:13:50.978
OBTAINING CREDIT BASED ON

05:13:51.045 --> 05:13:52.713
SOMEBODY ELSE'S IDENTITY

05:13:52.780 --> 05:13:53.915
IDENTIFICATION AND MUCH MORE.

05:13:53.981 --> 05:13:56.417
AND THIS BILL LARGELY BUILDS ON

05:13:56.484 --> 05:13:58.519
THOSE FOUNDATIONS. AND SO I

05:13:58.586 --> 05:14:00.988
THINK PRIVACY IS UNIVERSAL. IT

05:14:01.055 --> 05:14:02.890
IS ONE THING THAT BOTH

05:14:02.957 --> 05:14:05.660
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS DO

05:14:05.726 --> 05:14:07.428
BELIEVE IN. AND AT THE SAME

05:14:07.495 --> 05:14:11.499
TIME, A LOT OF THE INNOVATION

05:14:11.566 --> 05:14:12.900
ECONOMY THAT WE HAVE, YOU KNOW,

05:14:12.967 --> 05:14:14.936
AGAIN, TECHNOLOGY IS SO UTILIZED

05:14:15.002 --> 05:14:16.704
AND INFORMATION IS SHARED AT THE

05:14:16.771 --> 05:14:19.407
SPEED OF LIGHT THAT OFTENTIMES

05:14:19.473 --> 05:14:21.876
THE CONSUMER IS COMPLETELY

05:14:21.943 --> 05:14:24.078
UNAWARE THAT THIS INFORMATION IS

05:14:24.145 --> 05:14:25.880
BEING OUT THERE. I CAN ASSURE

05:14:25.947 --> 05:14:27.715
YOU THAT WHEN I TALK TO THE

05:14:27.782 --> 05:14:29.083
ELDERS IN MY COMMUNITY, THEY

05:14:29.150 --> 05:14:30.651
OFTEN DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THEY

05:14:30.718 --> 05:14:34.255
POSTED A PHOTO THAT HAS

05:14:34.322 --> 05:14:35.556
INFORMATION THAT IS LITERALLY

05:14:35.623 --> 05:14:37.558
TIED TO IT THAT CAN TELL YOU

05:14:37.625 --> 05:14:39.360
EXACTLY WHERE THEY WERE, WHAT

05:14:39.427 --> 05:14:41.395
TIME THE PHOTO WAS TAKEN, AND

05:14:41.462 --> 05:14:43.464
MUCH MORE. NOBODY IS FULLY AWARE

05:14:43.531 --> 05:14:46.334
OF THIS TYPE OF STUFF, AND SO I

05:14:46.400 --> 05:14:48.169
WANT TO PROTECT PEOPLE, WHETHER

05:14:48.236 --> 05:14:49.637
THEY ARE AWARE OF THE

05:14:49.704 --> 05:14:51.005
INFORMATION BEING SHARED OR

05:14:51.072 --> 05:14:53.341
UNAWARE. BUT IF THEY DECIDE TO

05:14:53.407 --> 05:14:54.575
CHOOSE TO DELETE THEIR

05:14:54.642 --> 05:14:55.977
INFORMATION WITH ONE OF THESE

05:14:56.043 --> 05:14:57.712
BROKERS, THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO

05:14:57.778 --> 05:14:59.714
DO SO. AND SO IT'S NO

05:14:59.780 --> 05:15:01.115
EXAGGERATION TO SAY THAT EVERY

05:15:01.182 --> 05:15:02.350
DAY WE DON'T COMMIT TO

05:15:02.416 --> 05:15:04.051
PROTECTING SENSITIVE PERSONAL

05:15:04.118 --> 05:15:06.554
INFORMATION. WE POTENTIALLY HARM

05:15:06.621 --> 05:15:08.356
THE 40 MILLION CALIFORNIANS THAT

05:15:08.422 --> 05:15:10.992
WE ARE HERE TO REPRESENT. SO SB

05:15:11.058 --> 05:15:13.060
435 ENSURES THAT SENSITIVE DATA

05:15:13.127 --> 05:15:15.563
MEANS SENSITIVE DATA WITH NO

05:15:15.630 --> 05:15:17.198
EXCEPTIONS, SO PEOPLE MAINTAIN

05:15:17.265 --> 05:15:19.634
FULL RIGHTS THAT THE CCPA GIVES

05:15:19.700 --> 05:15:22.136
THEM. DATA PRIVACY ONLINE

05:15:22.203 --> 05:15:23.437
DIRECTLY TRANSLATES TO PHYSICAL

05:15:23.504 --> 05:15:26.007
SAFETY OFFLINE. FOR UNDOCUMENTED

05:15:26.073 --> 05:15:28.109
AND MIXED STATUS FAMILIES. FOR

05:15:28.175 --> 05:15:29.877
PEOPLE WHO'VE HAD ABORTIONS OR

05:15:29.944 --> 05:15:31.479
ARE SEEKING TO HAVE AN ABORTION

05:15:31.545 --> 05:15:34.782
FOR THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY, FOR

05:15:34.849 --> 05:15:37.251
EVERY SINGLE INDIVIDUAL, NOW IS

05:15:37.318 --> 05:15:38.919
NOT THE TIME TO GET COLD FEET

05:15:38.986 --> 05:15:40.087
ABOUT PROTECTING OUR

05:15:40.154 --> 05:15:41.322
CONSTITUENTS AND OUR COMMUNITY.

05:15:41.389 --> 05:15:43.190
SO WE LOOK FORWARD AND WILL

05:15:43.257 --> 05:15:45.092
CONTINUE TO COMMIT WITH WORKING

05:15:45.159 --> 05:15:47.194
WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED,

05:15:47.261 --> 05:15:48.429
INCLUDING CAL CHAMBER, TO

05:15:48.496 --> 05:15:50.097
ACHIEVE THIS GOAL. SO I

05:15:50.164 --> 05:15:51.532
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE

05:15:51.599 --> 05:15:53.000
TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO CONTROL THEIR

05:15:53.067 --> 05:15:55.036
PRIVATE DATA, BECAUSE PUBLICLY

05:15:55.102 --> 05:15:57.638
AVAILABLE DATA SHOULD NEVER MEAN

05:15:57.705 --> 05:15:59.473
FREELY EXPLOITABLE DATA. THANK

05:15:59.540 --> 05:16:03.144
YOU. THANK YOU. AND I DON'T

05:16:03.210 --> 05:16:05.813
THINK WE HAVE A MOTION YET.

05:16:05.880 --> 05:16:07.581
OKAY, GREAT. WE HAVE MOTION IN A

05:16:07.648 --> 05:16:08.382
SECOND. WITH THAT WE CALL THE

05:16:08.449 --> 05:16:12.520
ROLL. ITEM NUMBER 13 SB 435 BY

05:16:12.586 --> 05:16:13.821
SENATOR WAHAB. THE MOTION IS DO

05:16:13.888 --> 05:16:15.489
PASS, AS AMENDED TO

05:16:15.556 --> 05:16:17.124
APPROPRIATIONS BILL KHN I

PELLERIN. I PETRIE-NORRIS WARD.

WIX. WIX I WILSON. WE HAVE THAT.

05:16:40.414 --> 05:16:41.916
BILL HAS FOUR VOTES. THE RULE

05:16:41.982 --> 05:16:43.017
REMAIN OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS.

05:16:43.084 --> 05:16:44.852
I SEE SENATOR HURTADO HAS SNUCK

05:16:44.919 --> 05:16:48.923
IN FRONT OF SENATOR ARAGON. COME

05:16:48.989 --> 05:16:53.661
ON UP. SORRY, SENATOR. THEY'RE

05:16:53.728 --> 05:16:55.996
ON THEIR WAY. THEY'LL BE HERE IN

05:16:56.063 --> 05:17:04.972

05:17:05.039 --> 05:17:06.741
AFTERNOON, MADAM CHAIR. AND

05:17:06.807 --> 05:17:08.909
MEMBERS, I'M PROUD TO PRESENT

05:17:08.976 --> 05:17:11.178
SENATE BILL 295, ONE OF FOUR

05:17:11.245 --> 05:17:12.313
BILLS THIS YEAR ADDRESSING THE

05:17:12.380 --> 05:17:13.647
GROWING AND URGENT ISSUE OF

05:17:13.714 --> 05:17:16.450
ALGORITHMIC PRICE FIXING. LAST

05:17:16.517 --> 05:17:18.285
YEAR, I INTRODUCED THE VERY

05:17:18.352 --> 05:17:20.721
FIRST VERSION OF THIS BILL AT A

05:17:20.788 --> 05:17:21.622
TIME WHEN IT SEEMED LIKE LITTLE

05:17:21.689 --> 05:17:23.023
WAS KNOWN ABOUT HOW DIGITAL

05:17:23.090 --> 05:17:24.658
TOOLS WERE QUIETLY DISTORTING

05:17:24.725 --> 05:17:27.628
MARKETS. THAT BILL DIDN'T MOVE

05:17:27.695 --> 05:17:30.731
FAR LAST YEAR, BUT I'M PROUD OF

05:17:30.798 --> 05:17:32.666
THE FACT THAT THIS YEAR IS

05:17:32.733 --> 05:17:35.669
DIFFERENT, AND I AM THANKFUL TO

05:17:35.736 --> 05:17:37.905
OUR COLLEAGUES. ASSEMBLYMEMBER

05:17:37.972 --> 05:17:39.607
AGUIAR-CURRY, SENATOR WAHAB AND

05:17:39.673 --> 05:17:41.709
SENATOR PEREZ FOR WORKING TO

05:17:41.776 --> 05:17:44.678
ADVANCE THIS CAUSE. AND I THINK

05:17:44.745 --> 05:17:47.481
IT'S A SIGN THAT THESE EFFORTS

05:17:47.548 --> 05:17:51.051
ARE NOT GOING AWAY. I ALSO WANT

05:17:51.118 --> 05:17:52.353
TO THANK THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE

05:17:52.420 --> 05:17:53.687
STAFF FOR COLLABORATING WITH MY

05:17:53.754 --> 05:17:55.122
OFFICE TO ADVANCE A STRONGER AND

05:17:55.189 --> 05:17:56.524
MORE COMPREHENSIVE VERSION OF

05:17:56.590 --> 05:17:58.592
THIS BILL. THE CHAIR, IN

05:17:58.659 --> 05:17:59.760
PARTICULAR, LIKELY UNDERSTANDS

05:17:59.827 --> 05:18:01.529
BETTER THAN ANYONE IN THIS

05:18:01.595 --> 05:18:04.799
LEGISLATURE WHY I CARE SO DEEPLY

05:18:04.865 --> 05:18:07.268
ABOUT THIS ISSUE. WE'VE WORKED

05:18:07.334 --> 05:18:10.538
TOGETHER BEFORE TO PUSH FOR

05:18:10.604 --> 05:18:11.939
GREATER FAIRNESS, AND I'M

05:18:12.006 --> 05:18:14.408
GRATEFUL FOR HER PARTNERSHIP.

05:18:14.475 --> 05:18:16.277
NOW, I KNOW THIS IS THE PRIVACY

05:18:16.343 --> 05:18:17.611
AND CONSUMER PROTECTION

05:18:17.678 --> 05:18:20.214
COMMITTEE, SO RATHER THAN GET

05:18:20.281 --> 05:18:22.550
INTO THE DETAILS AND WALK YOU

05:18:22.616 --> 05:18:23.150
THROUGH TECHNICAL ELEMENTS OF

05:18:23.217 --> 05:18:24.618
THE BILL, I'D REALLY LIKE TO

05:18:24.685 --> 05:18:27.354
SHARE MORE HOW I GOT HERE. THE

05:18:27.421 --> 05:18:29.490
JOURNEY DIDN'T. AND ALTHOUGH I

05:18:29.557 --> 05:18:32.092
THINK PEOPLE ASSUME THIS, IT

05:18:32.159 --> 05:18:34.195
DIDN'T BEGIN WITH HOUSING. IT

05:18:34.261 --> 05:18:36.430
ACTUALLY BEGAN WITH WATER. AND

05:18:36.497 --> 05:18:39.266
ABOUT 2020. AND IN MY DISTRICT,

05:18:39.333 --> 05:18:41.202
I'VE WATCHED FARMERS AND SMALL

05:18:41.268 --> 05:18:43.637
BUSINESS OWNERS WHAT SEEM TO BE,

05:18:43.704 --> 05:18:45.239
YOU KNOW, PUSHED OUT BY SYSTEMS

05:18:45.306 --> 05:18:47.842
THAT INCREASINGLY FELT RIGGED,

05:18:47.908 --> 05:18:50.077
RIGGED AGAINST THEM NOT JUST BY

05:18:50.144 --> 05:18:52.613
DROUGHT, BUT BY FORCES THEY

05:18:52.680 --> 05:18:54.815
COULDN'T SEE. I PURSUED A RANGE

05:18:54.882 --> 05:18:56.917
OF LEGISLATIVE SOLUTIONS, BUT I

05:18:56.984 --> 05:18:58.486
COULDN'T FULLY PINPOINT THE ROOT

05:18:58.552 --> 05:19:02.056
OF THE PROBLEM EITHER, WITH ONLY

05:19:02.122 --> 05:19:03.657
FACTS ON MY HAND FROM FARMERS

05:19:03.724 --> 05:19:05.960
AND THE HELP OF A FELLOW

05:19:06.026 --> 05:19:08.028
SENATOR, WE BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND

05:19:08.095 --> 05:19:12.099
THAT WHAT WE WERE WITNESSING IN

05:19:12.166 --> 05:19:14.602
2021 WERE SIGNS OF WHAT COULD BE

05:19:14.668 --> 05:19:16.470
CONSIDERED AN ANTITRUST ISSUE AT

05:19:16.537 --> 05:19:19.006
ITS ROOT. AND SO IN 2022, WE

05:19:19.073 --> 05:19:21.041
BROUGHT OUR CONCERNS TO THE US

05:19:21.108 --> 05:19:22.176
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN THE

05:19:22.243 --> 05:19:24.445
FORM OF A LETTER NOT JUST ONCE,

05:19:24.512 --> 05:19:27.248
BUT TWICE. THE SECOND LETTER,

05:19:27.314 --> 05:19:29.283
SIGNED ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS,

05:19:29.350 --> 05:19:29.817
HIGHLIGHTED WHAT WE THEN

05:19:29.884 --> 05:19:31.552
DESCRIBED AS TROUBLING SIGNS OF

05:19:31.619 --> 05:19:33.721
POSSIBLE MARKET MANIPULATION IN

05:19:33.787 --> 05:19:34.822
CALIFORNIA'S WATER SECTOR, WHERE

05:19:34.889 --> 05:19:36.891
LARGE INVESTORS WERE USING DATA,

05:19:36.957 --> 05:19:38.359
ALGORITHMS AND INSIDER ACCESS TO

05:19:38.425 --> 05:19:40.528
DISTORT PRICES AND SHUT OUT

05:19:40.594 --> 05:19:43.731
FAMILY FARMERS. AT THAT TIME, WE

05:19:43.797 --> 05:19:45.799
DIDN'T KNOW TO CALL IT

05:19:45.866 --> 05:19:48.736
ALGORITHMIC COLLUSION. BUT IN

05:19:48.802 --> 05:19:50.638
RETROSPECT, THOSE SAME PATTERNS

05:19:50.704 --> 05:19:53.173
CONTINUE TO SURFACE ACROSS OTHER

05:19:53.240 --> 05:19:54.275
SECTORS LIKE HOUSING, HEALTH

05:19:54.341 --> 05:19:56.777
CARE AND BEYOND. THAT

05:19:56.844 --> 05:19:58.846
REALIZATION IS WHAT LED ME TO

05:19:58.913 --> 05:20:01.849
INTRODUCE SB 54 LAST YEAR, AND

05:20:01.916 --> 05:20:05.252
NOW SB 295. AND ONE OF THE

05:20:05.319 --> 05:20:07.721
THINGS THAT I DO WANT TO POINT

05:20:07.788 --> 05:20:10.157
OUT IS THAT THERE'S THOSE THAT

05:20:10.224 --> 05:20:12.593
WILL ARGUE THAT WE MUST PROTECT

05:20:12.660 --> 05:20:15.095
INNOVATION AT ALL COST. AND WHAT

05:20:15.162 --> 05:20:16.864
I'LL SAY TO THAT IS THAT

05:20:16.931 --> 05:20:18.599
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS

05:20:18.666 --> 05:20:20.968
SUPPORT THESE TYPES OF EFFORTS.

05:20:21.035 --> 05:20:23.003
AND IF WE WANT TO BE HONEST, YOU

05:20:23.070 --> 05:20:24.905
KNOW, PRESIDENTS TRUMP CAMPAIGN

05:20:24.972 --> 05:20:26.507
GAINED MOMENTUM IN LARGE PART

05:20:26.574 --> 05:20:29.109
DUE TO HIS POSITION ON BIG TECH.

05:20:29.176 --> 05:20:31.211
AND THAT WE SHOULDN'T IGNORE

05:20:31.278 --> 05:20:33.514
THAT THE FIRST MAJOR ANTITRUST

05:20:33.581 --> 05:20:34.515
CASE AGAINST GOOGLE WAS LAUNCHED

05:20:34.582 --> 05:20:36.917
UNDER HIS GOT REALLY STARTED

05:20:36.984 --> 05:20:39.353
UNDER HIS ADMINISTRATION. AND

05:20:39.420 --> 05:20:41.488
UNDER THIS, YOU KNOW, CURRENT

05:20:41.555 --> 05:20:42.623
REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATION. JUST

05:20:42.690 --> 05:20:45.092
LAST MONTH, THE PRINCIPAL DEPUTY

05:20:45.159 --> 05:20:46.327
ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL,

05:20:46.393 --> 05:20:49.730
ROGER ALFORD, GAVE A SPEECH THAT

05:20:49.797 --> 05:20:51.332
CONFIRMED THE DOJ'S POSITION ON

05:20:51.398 --> 05:20:52.533
THIS ISSUE, MAKING IT CLEAR AND

05:20:52.600 --> 05:20:57.371
I'M GOING TO QUOTE HIM, SUCH

05:20:57.438 --> 05:20:58.539
ALGORITHMIC SHARING OF

05:20:58.606 --> 05:20:59.607
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION ON

05:20:59.673 --> 05:21:01.342
DIGITAL PLATFORMS SHOULD BE

05:21:01.408 --> 05:21:03.043
CHALLENGED AS A VIOLATION OF THE

05:21:03.110 --> 05:21:05.446
ANTITRUST LAWS. AND I WANT TO

05:21:05.512 --> 05:21:07.047
CLOSE MY STATEMENT BY SAYING

05:21:07.114 --> 05:21:08.616
THAT QUOTING SOMETHING ELSE THAT

05:21:08.682 --> 05:21:13.153
HE SAID THAT REALLY. KIND OF

05:21:13.220 --> 05:21:16.056
I'LL BE HONEST, IT INSPIRED ME.

05:21:16.123 --> 05:21:17.257
AND IT'S A REMINDER OF REALLY

05:21:17.324 --> 05:21:19.827
WHAT'S AT STAKE. AND I'LL QUOTE

05:21:19.893 --> 05:21:21.562
HIM ONCE AGAIN FROM HIS SPEECH.

05:21:21.629 --> 05:21:23.664
HE SAID, WE CONSISTENTLY REJECT

05:21:23.731 --> 05:21:25.032
ARGUMENTS THAT WE SHOULD EXCUSE

05:21:25.099 --> 05:21:26.934
HARM TO COMPETITION IN ORDER TO

05:21:27.001 --> 05:21:28.802
PROTECT A NATIONAL CHAMPION

05:21:28.869 --> 05:21:30.471
FIRM. WE DON'T ACCEPT THE

05:21:30.537 --> 05:21:31.939
PREMISE THAT SHIELDING OUR

05:21:32.006 --> 05:21:33.374
BUSINESSES FROM COMPETITION

05:21:33.440 --> 05:21:35.542
SOMEHOW MAKES US STRONGER. THE

05:21:35.609 --> 05:21:37.177
AMERICAN WAY OF WINNING THE

05:21:37.244 --> 05:21:39.446
GLOBAL ECONOMIC COMPETITION IS

05:21:39.513 --> 05:21:41.782
WITH STRONG COMPETITION IN OUR

05:21:41.849 --> 05:21:43.183
DOMESTIC FIRMS THAT MAKE OUR

05:21:43.250 --> 05:21:44.985
COMPANY STRONGER TO COMPETE

05:21:45.052 --> 05:21:46.420
ABROAD. THAT PREMISE HAS SERVED

05:21:46.487 --> 05:21:49.657
US WELL FOR CENTURIES, AND WE DO

05:21:49.723 --> 05:21:52.259
NOT INTEND TO ABANDON IT NOW.

05:21:52.326 --> 05:21:54.762
WITH THAT SAID, I TODAY TO

05:21:54.828 --> 05:21:57.264
TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB 295, I

05:21:57.331 --> 05:21:59.600
HAVE JONATHAN EISENBERG, WHO'S

05:21:59.667 --> 05:22:01.502
THE DEPUTY GENERAL COUNSEL FOR

05:22:01.568 --> 05:22:03.404
THE FOR LITIGATION AT THE AIDS

05:22:03.470 --> 05:22:06.907
HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION. THANK YOU

05:22:06.974 --> 05:22:12.713
SENATOR. I WANTED TO BEGIN MY

05:22:12.780 --> 05:22:14.815
STATEMENT BY QUOTING FROM ADAM

05:22:14.882 --> 05:22:16.517
SMITH FROM THE WEALTH OF

05:22:16.583 --> 05:22:19.720
NATIONS, 1776. AS I'M SURE YOU

05:22:19.787 --> 05:22:22.022
KNOW, ADAM SMITH IS WIDELY

05:22:22.089 --> 05:22:24.224
CONSIDERED TO BE THE FATHER OF

05:22:24.291 --> 05:22:27.094
FREE MARKET CAPITALISM AS AN

05:22:27.161 --> 05:22:29.596
ECONOMIC THEORY. AND HE WROTE,

05:22:29.663 --> 05:22:32.132
PEOPLE OF THE SAME TRADE SELDOM

05:22:32.199 --> 05:22:33.901
MEET TOGETHER, EVEN FOR

05:22:33.967 --> 05:22:36.236
MERRIMENT AND DIVERSION. BUT THE

05:22:36.303 --> 05:22:38.172
CONVERSATION ENDS IN A

05:22:38.238 --> 05:22:41.175
CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE PUBLIC OR

05:22:41.241 --> 05:22:43.877
CONTRIVANCE TO RAISE PRICES.

05:22:43.944 --> 05:22:46.780
WHAT HE IS REFERRING TO IS NOW

05:22:46.847 --> 05:22:50.117
UNDERSTOOD TO BE, OR IS CALLED,

05:22:50.184 --> 05:22:53.220
PRICE FIXING. GOING AFTER PRICE

05:22:53.287 --> 05:22:56.490
FIXING IS AS AMERICAN AND AS

05:22:56.557 --> 05:22:59.393
PRO-FREE MARKET AS CAN POSSIBLY

05:22:59.460 --> 05:23:05.165
BE. THE. BILL THAT SENATOR

05:23:05.232 --> 05:23:09.870
HURTADO HAS BEEN SPONSORING IS

05:23:09.937 --> 05:23:12.406
VERY FOCUSED AND HAS BECOME EVEN

05:23:12.473 --> 05:23:16.310
MORE FOCUSED ON ROOTING OUT

05:23:16.376 --> 05:23:20.047
CARTEL COLLUSIVE TYPE BEHAVIOR

05:23:20.114 --> 05:23:26.687
AND NOT TOUCHING OR DISTURBING

05:23:26.754 --> 05:23:29.757
BUSINESS ACTIVITY THAT MAY BE

05:23:29.823 --> 05:23:31.792
INNOVATIVE OR AT LEAST

05:23:31.859 --> 05:23:34.728
INNOCUOUS. OVER THE COURSE OF

05:23:34.795 --> 05:23:37.965
THE LIFE OF THIS BILL, IT HAS

05:23:38.031 --> 05:23:41.869
BEEN NARROWED SO THAT THE DATA

05:23:41.935 --> 05:23:43.570
BEING SHARED AMONG COMPETITORS

05:23:43.637 --> 05:23:46.707
IS LIMITED TO NONPUBLIC,

05:23:46.774 --> 05:23:49.109
COMPETITIVELY SENSITIVE DATA.

05:23:49.176 --> 05:23:51.245
THERE IS NOW A KNOWLEDGE, ACTUAL

05:23:51.311 --> 05:23:54.248
OR CONSTRUCTIVE REQUIREMENT FOR

05:23:54.314 --> 05:23:56.283
LIABILITY FOR BOTH PRICING

05:23:56.350 --> 05:23:58.452
ALGORITHM DISTRIBUTORS AND

05:23:58.519 --> 05:24:01.288
PRICING ALGORITHM USERS. THERE'S

05:24:01.355 --> 05:24:03.090
ALSO AN AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE

05:24:03.157 --> 05:24:06.059
AVAILABLE FOR USERS IF THEY

05:24:06.126 --> 05:24:09.563
EXERCISE DUE DILIGENCE TO SEE

05:24:09.630 --> 05:24:13.267
THAT THEY WERE NOT USING

05:24:13.333 --> 05:24:15.769
NONPUBLIC COMPETITOR DATA IN A

05:24:15.836 --> 05:24:19.673
COLLUSIVE MANNER. THE NUMBER OF

05:24:19.740 --> 05:24:22.309
POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS THAT A USER

05:24:22.376 --> 05:24:24.344
CAN BE SUBJECT TO HAS BEEN

05:24:24.411 --> 05:24:29.783
LIMITED. THE BILL EXCLUDES FROM

05:24:29.850 --> 05:24:31.485
CONSIDERATION SO-CALLED STALE

05:24:31.552 --> 05:24:33.754
DATA THAT MIGHT BE IN A PRICING

05:24:33.821 --> 05:24:37.691
ALGORITHM DATABASE. THE PENALTY

05:24:37.758 --> 05:24:39.593
HAS BEEN REDUCED FROM A MAXIMUM

05:24:39.660 --> 05:24:42.763
OF $1 MILLION TO A MAXIMUM OF

05:24:42.830 --> 05:24:45.265
OVER 20 OF ONLY $25,000,

05:24:45.332 --> 05:24:46.700
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE OTHER, THERE

05:24:46.767 --> 05:24:50.971
ARE OTHER REMEDIES AVAILABLE,

05:24:51.038 --> 05:24:55.275
AND SO THIS BILL IS NOT A

05:24:55.342 --> 05:24:57.444
RADICAL MEASURE. IT'S NOT ONE

05:24:57.511 --> 05:25:03.217
THAT WOULD IN ANY WAY INHIBIT

05:25:03.283 --> 05:25:05.652
CALIFORNIA'S INNOVATIVE HIGH

05:25:05.719 --> 05:25:10.090
TECH ECONOMY. THANK YOU, THANK

05:25:10.157 --> 05:25:11.558
YOU. ANYBODY ELSE HERE IN

05:25:11.625 --> 05:25:13.694
SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE? PLEASE

05:25:13.760 --> 05:25:15.028
COME UP. NAME, ORGANIZATION AND

05:25:15.095 --> 05:25:17.798
POSITION. SEEING NONE, ANYONE

05:25:17.865 --> 05:25:20.634
HERE IN OPPOSITION CAN JOIN US.

05:25:20.701 --> 05:25:32.179
TWO PEOPLE CAN JOIN US HERE.

05:25:32.246 --> 05:25:33.614
THE PROFESSOR IS ALWAYS IN

05:25:33.680 --> 05:25:35.349
RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION. WELL,

05:25:35.415 --> 05:25:37.818
LAST NIGHT, SENATOR UMBERG WAS

05:25:37.885 --> 05:25:40.787
COUNTING. HE WAS, AND I WILL

05:25:40.854 --> 05:25:43.156
SAY, HAVING SIX BILLS THAT WERE

05:25:43.223 --> 05:25:45.459
ALL LAST, THEY GOT LESS

05:25:45.525 --> 05:25:46.393
RESPECTFUL AS WE GOT CLOSER TO

05:25:46.460 --> 05:25:49.363
1030 AT NIGHT. AS TIME

05:25:49.429 --> 05:25:52.165
PROGRESSED, MADAM CHAIR CHRIS

05:25:52.232 --> 05:25:53.767
MICHELI, ON BEHALF OF THE CIVIL

05:25:53.834 --> 05:25:55.502

CALIFORNIA. YES. AND

05:25:57.004 --> 05:25:58.338
RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE, UNLESS

05:25:58.405 --> 05:25:59.806
AMENDED, I'M GOING TO LEAVE IT

05:25:59.873 --> 05:26:02.376
TO MY COLLEAGUES TO TALK ABOUT

05:26:02.442 --> 05:26:04.111
THE ALGORITHMIC ASPECTS OF IT. I

05:26:04.177 --> 05:26:06.346
WANTED TO FOCUS FROM CDRH

05:26:06.413 --> 05:26:08.849
PERSPECTIVE ON TWO PROVISIONS

05:26:08.916 --> 05:26:10.984
THE MAIN ONE BEING PROPOSED,

05:26:11.051 --> 05:26:13.987
SECTION 1737 THREE, WHICH ALLOWS

05:26:14.054 --> 05:26:15.789
A CIVIL ACTION, NO PRIVATE RIGHT

05:26:15.856 --> 05:26:17.557
OF ACTION, BUT A CIVIL ACTION BY

05:26:17.624 --> 05:26:19.226
THE AG, LOCAL PROSECUTORS,

05:26:19.293 --> 05:26:21.528
COUNTY COUNSEL, CITY ATTORNEY,

05:26:21.595 --> 05:26:23.931
INCLUDING UP TO A $25,000 CIVIL

05:26:23.997 --> 05:26:26.066
PENALTY, PUNITIVE DAMAGES,

05:26:26.133 --> 05:26:28.602
ATTORNEY'S FEES AND COSTS, IN

05:26:28.669 --> 05:26:30.437
ADDITION TO ANY OTHER AVAILABLE

05:26:30.504 --> 05:26:33.240
REMEDIES UNDER PROPOSED SECTION

05:26:33.307 --> 05:26:35.442
17375. OUR CONCERN IS THAT WITH

05:26:35.509 --> 05:26:37.544
THE BREADTH AND POTENTIAL

05:26:37.611 --> 05:26:39.012
UNCERTAINTY WITH A NUMBER OF THE

05:26:39.079 --> 05:26:41.548
PROVISIONS OF THE BILL, WE SEE

05:26:41.615 --> 05:26:43.183
SIGNIFICANT LIABILITY EXPOSURE.

LOT OF THESE TYPES OF ISSUES

05:31:24.864 --> 05:31:27.500
GOING ON IN OUR ECONOMY, ACROSS

THE STATE, ACROSS THE COUNTRY,

05:31:30.036 --> 05:31:32.205
WE I THINK WE DO NEED TO PROVIDE

THAT ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. WE DO

05:31:33.640 --> 05:31:36.776

AND, YOU KNOW, I'LL JUST SAY

05:31:38.211 --> 05:31:40.347
THAT I THINK THAT LAST YEAR IT

05:31:40.413 --> 05:31:42.449

LOUD AND CLEAR MESSAGE THAT THEY

05:31:46.186 --> 05:31:49.456
WANT US TO BE TOUGH ON ON CRIME.

05:31:49.522 --> 05:31:50.724
AND THAT MEANS TACKLING ALL

05:31:50.790 --> 05:31:52.559
FORMS OF IT, INCLUDING WHITE

05:31:52.626 --> 05:31:54.928

05:31:57.364 --> 05:31:59.099
OUR ECONOMY AND DESTROYING

ACTUALLY A NEUTRAL NEUTRAL SO

05:36:29.168 --> 05:36:30.436

05:36:57.630 --> 05:36:58.998
LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE

05:36:59.065 --> 05:37:00.400
AUTHOR AND HER STAFF FOR WORKING

05:37:00.466 --> 05:37:02.669
WITH US. WE DO NOT CURRENTLY

05:37:02.735 --> 05:37:03.202
OPPOSE SB 503 AND REMAIN

05:37:03.269 --> 05:37:04.337
ENCOURAGED THAT WE CAN FIND A

05:37:04.404 --> 05:37:06.172
SOLUTION. THAT SAID, WE WANT TO

05:37:06.239 --> 05:37:07.840
FLAG A FEW CONCERNS THE BILL.

05:37:07.907 --> 05:37:09.342
THE BILL COULD UNINTENTIONALLY

05:37:09.409 --> 05:37:11.177
CAPTURE A WIDE RANGE OF TOOLS,

05:37:11.244 --> 05:37:12.979
INCLUDING LOW RISK TECHNOLOGIES,

05:37:13.046 --> 05:37:14.781
FDA REVIEWED DEVICES, AND ARE

USED SOLELY IN RESEARCH AND

05:37:16.683 --> 05:37:18.084
DEVELOPMENT. THIS WOULD CREATE

05:37:18.151 --> 05:37:19.452
DUPLICATIVE AND BURDENSOME

05:37:19.519 --> 05:37:20.620

05:37:24.090 --> 05:37:24.824
ESPECIALLY WITH THE RECENT

05:37:24.891 --> 05:37:27.427
ADDITION OF THIRD PARTY AUDITOR

05:37:27.493 --> 05:37:28.761

05:37:30.797 --> 05:37:31.931

05:37:34.367 --> 05:37:36.369

PRESERVE INNOVATION. THANK YOU.

05:37:38.504 --> 05:37:39.339
I LET YOU BREAK THE RULES

05:37:39.405 --> 05:37:40.974
BECAUSE THERE WAS NO OPPOSITION

05:37:41.040 --> 05:37:43.643
WITNESS, BUT DON'T TAKE THAT AS

05:37:43.710 --> 05:37:47.046
PERMISSION IN THE FUTURE. MADAM

05:37:47.113 --> 05:37:48.414
CHAIR MEMBERS JOHN WINGER, ON

05:37:48.481 --> 05:37:50.717
BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL TRADE

05:37:50.783 --> 05:37:51.484
ASSOCIATION FOR THE MEDICAL

05:37:51.551 --> 05:37:53.286
DEVICE INDUSTRY, ALIGN OUR

05:37:53.353 --> 05:37:55.922
COMMENTS WITH CLS AND LOOK

05:37:55.989 --> 05:37:56.456
FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR

05:37:56.522 --> 05:37:58.257
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR.

05:37:58.324 --> 05:38:01.661
THANK YOU. OKAY, SEEING NO ONE

05:38:01.728 --> 05:38:03.496
ELSE HERE, I ASSUME THAT WAS

05:38:03.563 --> 05:38:05.264
OPPOSITION AND TWAIN BRINGING IT

05:38:05.331 --> 05:38:08.368
BACK TO THE DAIS. YES, WE'LL

05:38:08.434 --> 05:38:11.170
START WITH SENATOR DE MAYO AND

05:38:11.237 --> 05:38:12.672
THEN THE VICE CHAIR. THAT'S

05:38:12.739 --> 05:38:16.275
OKAY. I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE

05:38:16.342 --> 05:38:18.444
AMENDMENTS. I THINK WE SHOULD

05:38:18.511 --> 05:38:22.448
START WITH. FIRST AND FOREMOST,

05:38:22.515 --> 05:38:25.284
I'M THRILLED THAT CMA IS HERE. I

05:38:25.351 --> 05:38:26.753
APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR WORKING

05:38:26.819 --> 05:38:28.588
WITH THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY IN

05:38:28.655 --> 05:38:30.323
A THOUGHTFUL WAY. TO HAVE THAT

05:38:30.390 --> 05:38:32.592
SUPPORT SAYS A LOT TO ME. IT

05:38:32.659 --> 05:38:34.227
KIND OF CARRIES ON THE COMMENT I

05:38:34.293 --> 05:38:36.129
SAID EARLIER ABOUT SOME OF THE

05:38:36.195 --> 05:38:37.330
CONCERNS I HAVE ABOUT SOME OF

05:38:37.397 --> 05:38:39.766
THE OTHER BILLS IN THIS SPACE,

05:38:39.832 --> 05:38:42.001
THE REASON WHY I THINK THE AUDIT

05:38:42.068 --> 05:38:44.003
REQUIREMENT IS PERHAPS

05:38:44.070 --> 05:38:45.772
TROUBLESOME IS IT DOES IMPOSE A

05:38:45.838 --> 05:38:49.809
REGULATORY COST. PERHAPS WE

05:38:49.876 --> 05:38:50.877
IMPLEMENT THE STANDARDS FIRST,

05:38:50.943 --> 05:38:52.645
AND IF THERE ARE PROBLEMS THAT

05:38:52.712 --> 05:38:54.981
WE SEE WITH HOW THEY ARE

05:38:55.048 --> 05:38:55.848
IMPLEMENTING THE STANDARDS, YOU

05:38:55.915 --> 05:38:57.684
KNOW, THE REASONABLE CARE

05:38:57.750 --> 05:39:00.219
REQUIREMENT, THE REQUIREMENT TO

05:39:00.286 --> 05:39:01.754
EVALUATE THEIR USE OF AI FROM

05:39:01.821 --> 05:39:03.956
THE STANDPOINT OF BIAS. IF THERE

05:39:04.023 --> 05:39:05.425
ARE PROBLEMS, WE CAN ALWAYS COME

05:39:05.491 --> 05:39:07.126
BACK AND LOOK AT THE AUDIT

05:39:07.193 --> 05:39:08.828
REQUIREMENT AT THAT POINT. BUT I

05:39:08.895 --> 05:39:11.164
THINK THIS MAY BE GOING TOO, TOO

05:39:11.230 --> 05:39:12.398
FAST. SO I WOULD REALLY

05:39:12.465 --> 05:39:14.434
ENCOURAGE I'M GOING TO LAY OFF

05:39:14.500 --> 05:39:15.435
THE BILL TODAY, BUT AS IT GETS

05:39:15.501 --> 05:39:17.904
TO THE FLOOR, I WOULD REALLY

05:39:17.970 --> 05:39:18.504
STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THAT THAT

05:39:18.571 --> 05:39:20.073
AUDIT REQUIREMENT BE

05:39:20.139 --> 05:39:22.375
RECONSIDERED. SO THANK YOU.

05:39:22.442 --> 05:39:25.845
THOSE WERE COMMITTEE. YEAH. AND

05:39:25.912 --> 05:39:28.114
I'LL I MEAN IF YOU DON'T MIND,

05:39:28.181 --> 05:39:30.283
THAT WAS A CONVERSATION THAT I

05:39:30.349 --> 05:39:31.884
HAD WITH THE AUTHOR. I THINK THE

05:39:31.951 --> 05:39:32.985
BILL IS REALLY IMPORTANT. I MEAN

05:39:33.052 --> 05:39:34.454
IT COVERS ALL PROTECTED CLASSES.

05:39:34.520 --> 05:39:36.422
SO IT COVERS ME AS A WOMAN WHO

05:39:36.489 --> 05:39:38.057
SEEKS HEALTH CARE AS WELL. I

05:39:38.124 --> 05:39:39.092
KNOW IT'S A BLACK CAUCUS

05:39:39.158 --> 05:39:40.193
PRIORITY BECAUSE IT'S CRITICALLY

05:39:40.259 --> 05:39:41.260
IMPORTANT TO THE BLACK

05:39:41.327 --> 05:39:42.195
COMMUNITY, BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO

05:39:42.261 --> 05:39:44.230
ALL PROTECTED CLASSES. AND THE

05:39:44.297 --> 05:39:46.699
BILL'S REQUIREMENTS ARE ACTUALLY

05:39:46.766 --> 05:39:48.000
AND I THINK THIS WAS INTENTIONAL

05:39:48.067 --> 05:39:49.535
OF THE AUTHOR CAN SPEAK TO THIS

05:39:49.602 --> 05:39:52.205
MORE DIRECTLY. YOU KNOW, IT SAYS

05:39:52.271 --> 05:39:53.773
THAT THEY NEED TO OVERSEE AND

05:39:53.840 --> 05:39:55.041
ENSURE, RIGHT, BUT IT DOESN'T

05:39:55.108 --> 05:39:57.043
HAVE STRICT, DETAILED

05:39:57.110 --> 05:39:59.345
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE HEALTH CARE

05:39:59.412 --> 05:40:01.214
PROVIDERS. AND SO MY CONCERN, AS

05:40:01.280 --> 05:40:03.149
I TOLD THE AUTHOR, WAS BORN OUT

05:40:03.216 --> 05:40:05.118
OF A BILL WE DID A COUPLE OF

05:40:05.184 --> 05:40:06.686
YEARS AGO BY ONE OF OUR

05:40:06.753 --> 05:40:07.286
COLLEAGUES, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

05:40:07.353 --> 05:40:08.254
WARD, THAT REQUIRED THE

05:40:08.321 --> 05:40:09.388
GOVERNMENT, THE STATE, TO PUT

05:40:09.455 --> 05:40:12.625
OUT WHAT AUTOMATED DECISION

05:40:12.692 --> 05:40:13.459
SYSTEMS THEY WERE USING, THE

05:40:13.526 --> 05:40:15.128
HIGH RISK SPACE. THEY JUST

05:40:15.194 --> 05:40:16.729
SUBMITTED THAT REPORT A COUPLE

05:40:16.796 --> 05:40:18.297
MONTHS AGO, I THINK IT WAS. AND

05:40:18.364 --> 05:40:20.900
THEY SAID THERE WERE ZERO ZERO.

05:40:20.967 --> 05:40:22.435
SO THE STATE GOVERNMENT IS

05:40:22.502 --> 05:40:23.402
CLAIMING THEY ARE USING ZERO

05:40:23.469 --> 05:40:24.804
HIGH RISK AUTOMATED DECISION

05:40:24.871 --> 05:40:27.640
SYSTEMS. I THINK EVERYBODY IN

05:40:27.707 --> 05:40:29.509
THIS ROOM KNOWS THAT IS NOT THE

05:40:29.575 --> 05:40:30.977
CASE. I MEAN, THEY'RE USING

05:40:31.043 --> 05:40:32.512
HIRING TOOLS. THEY'RE USING

05:40:32.578 --> 05:40:34.313
THEIR TOOLS ARE USED IN THE

05:40:34.380 --> 05:40:36.015
COURTS. AND IT WASN'T EVEN THAT

05:40:36.082 --> 05:40:37.150
THEY HAD TO DO ANYTHING. THEY

05:40:37.216 --> 05:40:38.985
JUST WERE TELLING US. BUT THEY

05:40:39.051 --> 05:40:40.086
CAME BACK WITH NONE. SO I THINK

05:40:40.153 --> 05:40:42.455
THAT THAT SORT OF PIQUED MY

05:40:42.522 --> 05:40:44.757
INTEREST IN THESE BROAD BILLS TO

05:40:44.824 --> 05:40:46.159
SAY, HOW ARE THEY BEING

05:40:46.225 --> 05:40:47.560
INTERPRETED SUCH THAT MAYBE

05:40:47.627 --> 05:40:48.161
NOTHING WILL HAPPEN. AND THAT

05:40:48.227 --> 05:40:50.029
WAS MY CONCERN, WAS THAT BECAUSE

05:40:50.096 --> 05:40:51.464
OF ITS BREADTH, I WANTED TO MAKE

05:40:51.531 --> 05:40:53.132
SURE THERE WAS SOME OVERSIGHT TO

05:40:53.199 --> 05:40:54.700
ENSURE THAT THIS WAS HAPPENING.

05:40:54.767 --> 05:40:56.903
I THINK THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS

05:40:56.969 --> 05:40:57.537
REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT, AND I

05:40:57.603 --> 05:40:59.438
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AT SOME

05:40:59.505 --> 05:41:00.940
POINT WE HAVE SOME EYES MAKING

05:41:01.007 --> 05:41:02.975
SURE THAT THERE IS

05:41:03.042 --> 05:41:03.543
NONDISCRIMINATION IN THESE

05:41:03.609 --> 05:41:05.011
TOOLS. AND I THINK THAT IS THE

05:41:05.077 --> 05:41:07.013
ROLE THE AUDITORS WILL PLAY.

05:41:07.079 --> 05:41:08.748
WE'VE PUSHED OUT TO 2030. WE

05:41:08.815 --> 05:41:10.183
ALSO, IN CONVERSATION WITH THE

05:41:10.249 --> 05:41:12.418
AUTHOR, ONLY PUT THAT ON THE

05:41:12.485 --> 05:41:16.422
DEVELOPERS. SO I MY GUESS

05:41:16.489 --> 05:41:18.224
ALTHOUGH CMA HASN'T HAD A CHANCE

05:41:18.291 --> 05:41:20.393
TO LOOK AT IT, CMA WON'T BE. I

05:41:20.459 --> 05:41:22.061
CAN'T IMAGINE THERE ARE MANY CMA

05:41:22.128 --> 05:41:23.262
MEMBERS WHO ARE DEVELOPING THESE

05:41:23.329 --> 05:41:24.697
TOOLS, BUT CORRECT ME IF I'M

05:41:24.764 --> 05:41:26.232
WRONG, THERE'S A FEW APPARENTLY

05:41:26.299 --> 05:41:28.201
CMA MEMBERS. MAYBE THEY'RE NOW

05:41:28.267 --> 05:41:31.204
TECH FOLKS. YOU KNOW IT IS

05:41:31.270 --> 05:41:32.371
DEVELOPERS. I KNOW WE ALSO

05:41:32.438 --> 05:41:33.739
INDICATED IN THE ANALYSIS ON

05:41:33.806 --> 05:41:35.842
PAGE EIGHT THAT, YOU KNOW, AS WE

05:41:35.908 --> 05:41:37.143
LOOK AT THIS, IF THERE ARE OTHER

05:41:37.210 --> 05:41:38.511
SAFETY NET PROVIDERS WHO WOULD

05:41:38.578 --> 05:41:40.646
BE BROUGHT IN, THAT WE WILL MAKE

05:41:40.713 --> 05:41:41.981
SURE TO BE KEENLY AWARE OF THAT

05:41:42.048 --> 05:41:43.149
AND CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE

05:41:43.216 --> 05:41:45.484
AUTHOR ON THAT. BUT WE WERE

05:41:45.551 --> 05:41:46.586
THOUGHTFUL IN WHO WE DIRECTED

05:41:46.652 --> 05:41:47.286
THIS AUDIT TO. SO IT ISN'T

05:41:47.353 --> 05:41:49.222
AFFECTING OUR HOSPITALS, WHO I

05:41:49.288 --> 05:41:50.990
KNOW ARE ON THE BRINK, BUT

05:41:51.057 --> 05:41:51.624
INSTEAD REALLY THE DEVELOPERS

05:41:51.691 --> 05:41:53.526
WHO ARE MAKING THESE TOOLS FOR

05:41:53.593 --> 05:41:55.928
HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIAN GROUPS

05:41:55.995 --> 05:41:57.430
AND OTHERS THAT ARE BUYING

05:41:57.496 --> 05:41:59.098
THESE. BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT

05:41:59.165 --> 05:42:00.132
WHEN THEY END UP IN THE HANDS OF

05:42:00.199 --> 05:42:02.235
THE USERS, THEY AREN'T BIASED.

05:42:02.301 --> 05:42:03.769
AND I WILL SAY THAT THIS

05:42:03.836 --> 05:42:04.770
COMMITTEE CO-CHAIRED A HEARING

05:42:04.837 --> 05:42:06.172
WITH THE HEALTH COMMITTEE ON AI

05:42:06.239 --> 05:42:08.875
AND HEALTH. I THINK SOME OF YOU

05:42:08.941 --> 05:42:10.109
WERE THERE, AND ONE OF THE MOST

05:42:10.176 --> 05:42:11.677
SHOCKING MOMENTS OF THAT HEARING

05:42:11.744 --> 05:42:13.246
WAS ONE OF OUR LARGE SOUTHERN

05:42:13.312 --> 05:42:14.313
CALIFORNIA HEALTH SYSTEMS CAME

05:42:14.380 --> 05:42:17.216
UP AND DESCRIBED AN AI TOOL THAT

05:42:17.283 --> 05:42:18.651
IS PREDICTING WHETHER WOMEN HAVE

05:42:18.718 --> 05:42:21.120
C-SECTIONS. AND IN THAT

05:42:21.187 --> 05:42:23.022
TESTIMONY, HE SAID, WHAT'S

05:42:23.089 --> 05:42:24.857
AMAZING IS THAT THESE AI TOOLS

05:42:24.924 --> 05:42:27.426
ARE 90% ACCURATE IN WHETHER

05:42:27.493 --> 05:42:31.564
THEY, A WOMAN, ENDS UP HAVING A

05:42:31.631 --> 05:42:33.699
C-SECTION. SO I ASKED, DO YOU

05:42:33.766 --> 05:42:35.468
THINK THAT'S BECAUSE THE TOOL

05:42:35.534 --> 05:42:37.503
KNOWS WHO'S HAVING A C-SECTION,

05:42:37.570 --> 05:42:39.739
OR BECAUSE THE DOCTOR THAT'S

05:42:39.805 --> 05:42:42.642
MANAGING NUMEROUS PATIENTS SEES

05:42:42.708 --> 05:42:44.176
THAT THE TOOL IS PREDICTING A

05:42:44.243 --> 05:42:45.578
C-SECTION, THEN DOES A

05:42:45.645 --> 05:42:46.345
C-SECTION, LIKE, HOW IS THAT

05:42:46.412 --> 05:42:48.314
PLAYING OUT? AND HAVE YOU LOOKED

05:42:48.381 --> 05:42:50.149
INTO IT? HE DIDN'T HADN'T

05:42:50.216 --> 05:42:51.183
THOUGHT OF THAT, WHICH WAS QUITE

05:42:51.250 --> 05:42:52.051
FASCINATING. BUT THEN I SAID,

05:42:52.118 --> 05:42:53.352
WELL, HAVE YOU LOOKED SINCE

05:42:53.419 --> 05:42:54.587
YOU'VE DEPLOYED THIS TOOL,

05:42:54.654 --> 05:42:56.022
WHETHER, YOU KNOW, MATERNAL

05:42:56.088 --> 05:42:57.123
MORTALITY, ESPECIALLY AMONGST

05:42:57.189 --> 05:42:58.758
BLACK WOMEN, IS SOMETHING THIS

05:42:58.824 --> 05:43:00.393
LEGISLATURE IS KEENLY FOCUSED

05:43:00.459 --> 05:43:01.594
ON. HAVE YOU LOOKED AT WHETHER

05:43:01.661 --> 05:43:03.896
THIS TOOL IS PREDICTING

05:43:03.963 --> 05:43:05.698
DIFFERENT OUTCOMES FOR DIFFERENT

05:43:05.765 --> 05:43:08.601
PEOPLE OF COLOR? HOW IS THIS

05:43:08.668 --> 05:43:10.369
PLAYING OUT? THEY HAD DONE NO

05:43:10.436 --> 05:43:12.104
ANALYSIS. IT WAS SHOCKING TO ME

05:43:12.171 --> 05:43:13.639
THAT WE HAVE A TOOL THAT IS

05:43:13.706 --> 05:43:15.374
BEING USED CURRENTLY IN ONE OF

05:43:15.441 --> 05:43:16.575
CALIFORNIA'S LARGE HEALTH

05:43:16.642 --> 05:43:19.011
SYSTEMS, AND FOR SOMETHING AS

05:43:19.078 --> 05:43:20.079
SIGNIFICANT DECISION AS WHETHER

05:43:20.146 --> 05:43:22.014
A WOMAN HAS A C-SECTION AND THE

05:43:22.081 --> 05:43:23.416
HOSPITAL SYSTEM IS NOT DOING

05:43:23.482 --> 05:43:25.184
SOME SORT OF ANALYSIS ON WHETHER

05:43:25.251 --> 05:43:27.286
OR NOT THE OUTCOME OF THAT IS

05:43:27.353 --> 05:43:28.921
HARMING THE WOMEN IN THEIR

05:43:28.988 --> 05:43:30.289
SYSTEM. AND SO I THINK THAT IS

05:43:30.356 --> 05:43:31.657
THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS. LIKE WE

05:43:31.724 --> 05:43:33.125
SHOULD KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT.

05:43:33.192 --> 05:43:35.661
WE SHOULD KNOW THAT IT ISN'T

05:43:35.728 --> 05:43:36.662
CAUSING MORE, YOU KNOW, WOMEN OF

05:43:36.729 --> 05:43:37.730
COLOR TO HAVE C-SECTIONS OR

05:43:37.797 --> 05:43:39.332
WHATEVER THE CASE IS. AND I'M

05:43:39.398 --> 05:43:41.000
NOT SAYING IT IS. I DON'T KNOW

05:43:41.067 --> 05:43:42.368
THE ANSWER. THEY DIDN'T KNOW THE

05:43:42.435 --> 05:43:44.036
ANSWER. BUT WE SHOULD MAKE SURE

05:43:44.103 --> 05:43:46.005
THAT THAT IS THE CASE. AS AI

05:43:46.072 --> 05:43:47.940
STARTS TO BECOME MORE INTEGRATED

05:43:48.007 --> 05:43:48.708
INTO OUR HEALTHCARE DECISIONS.

05:43:48.774 --> 05:43:49.976
SO THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S

05:43:50.042 --> 05:43:51.277
IMPORTANT THAT THERE IS THIS

05:43:51.344 --> 05:43:52.411
OUTSIDE EYES THAT IT'S NOT

05:43:52.478 --> 05:43:54.013
ALWAYS GRADING OUR OWN, TESTING

05:43:54.080 --> 05:43:55.614
OUR OWN TESTS IN VAGUE WAYS. AND

05:43:55.681 --> 05:43:57.283
I REALLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR

05:43:57.350 --> 05:43:59.118
WORKING WITH ME ON THAT. YES,

05:43:59.185 --> 05:44:02.722
MADAM VICE CHAIR. I'M SUPPORTING

05:44:02.788 --> 05:44:04.290
THE BILL AND HAPPY TO, AND I

05:44:04.357 --> 05:44:05.491
APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING IT

05:44:05.558 --> 05:44:07.460
FORWARD. IF I JUST MIGHT MAKE A

05:44:07.526 --> 05:44:08.361
COMMENT, GIVEN THAT, OF COURSE

05:44:08.427 --> 05:44:11.397
IT'S THE END OF THE DAY, ALMOST,

05:44:11.464 --> 05:44:11.998
AND THE COMPLEXITY OF AI, AND

05:44:12.064 --> 05:44:13.232
WE'VE BEEN WRESTLING WITH THIS

05:44:13.299 --> 05:44:15.267
NOW FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS. I

05:44:15.334 --> 05:44:16.268
JUST APPRECIATE THE SIMPLICITY

05:44:16.335 --> 05:44:19.805
OF YOUR BILL THAT HAS MAJOR

05:44:19.872 --> 05:44:21.941
IMPACT. IT WILL DO GOOD WORK. IT

05:44:22.008 --> 05:44:26.345
WILL DO AND SURFACE VARIOUS

05:44:26.412 --> 05:44:29.315
BIASES OR INADEQUACIES THAT

05:44:29.382 --> 05:44:30.783
EXIST. BUT IT WAS VERY

05:44:30.850 --> 05:44:33.919
STRAIGHTFORWARD, WELL CRAFTED. I

05:44:33.986 --> 05:44:36.389
APPRECIATE IT GIVEN AI IS

05:44:36.455 --> 05:44:37.723
GETTING OUR BRAINS AROUND. THIS

05:44:37.790 --> 05:44:40.059
IS VERY COMPLEX, BUT YOURS IS A

05:44:40.126 --> 05:44:41.660
SIMPLE REQUEST. I ACTUALLY THINK

05:44:41.727 --> 05:44:44.497
IN THE MEDICAL WORLD, WHETHER

05:44:44.563 --> 05:44:47.233
IT'S C-SECTIONS OR NOT, THE AI

05:44:47.299 --> 05:44:48.567
WILL SERVE, WHETHER IT'S

05:44:48.634 --> 05:44:50.002
DISEASES AND CHRONIC DISEASES,

05:44:50.069 --> 05:44:53.339
RARE DISEASES, WILL. AI IS A

05:44:53.406 --> 05:44:55.174
TOOL TO HELP EVERYBODY

05:44:55.241 --> 05:44:57.043
UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON, TO

05:44:57.109 --> 05:44:59.845
SHARE INFORMATION AND SUCCESS OR

05:44:59.912 --> 05:45:01.280
FAILURES SO THAT WE GET TO

05:45:01.347 --> 05:45:03.382
BETTER OUTCOMES WITH MEDICAL

05:45:03.449 --> 05:45:05.217
SCIENCE. SO ANYWAY, I APPRECIATE

05:45:05.284 --> 05:45:06.485
YOUR BILL AND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING

05:45:06.552 --> 05:45:08.754
TO DO. AND I THINK IT HAS GREAT

05:45:08.821 --> 05:45:10.723
POTENTIAL IN A POSITIVE WAY.

05:45:10.790 --> 05:45:18.164
THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE HAVE

05:45:18.230 --> 05:45:21.333
COMMENTS? QUESTIONS? NO. SO I'VE

05:45:21.400 --> 05:45:22.601
ALREADY GIVEN MY LITTLE SPEECH.

05:45:22.668 --> 05:45:24.670
SO I WILL TURN IT OVER TO YOU.

05:45:24.737 --> 05:45:26.338
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YEAH.

05:45:26.405 --> 05:45:27.973
OH SORRY. I'M SORRY. JUST

05:45:28.040 --> 05:45:30.009
QUICKLY I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE

05:45:30.076 --> 05:45:31.277
LOOKING THROUGH THIS OF HOW WE

05:45:31.343 --> 05:45:32.912
CAN BEST SAFEGUARD THIS. AND I

05:45:32.978 --> 05:45:35.081
UNDERSTAND IT MIGHT NOT BE A

05:45:35.147 --> 05:45:35.714
DIRECT COST TO THE HOSPITALS,

05:45:35.781 --> 05:45:37.383
BUT IT COULD INCREASE THE COST

05:45:37.450 --> 05:45:38.384
OF THE TECHNOLOGY TO THE PEOPLE

05:45:38.451 --> 05:45:40.019
THAT ARE BUYING IT. AND THAT IS

05:45:40.086 --> 05:45:41.921
A CONCERN FOR ME CONSIDERING MY

05:45:41.987 --> 05:45:44.390
HOSPITALS ARE STRUGGLING. BUT I

05:45:44.457 --> 05:45:44.924
KNOW THAT THEY NEED THIS

05:45:44.990 --> 05:45:46.292
TECHNOLOGY. SO I ACTUALLY WAS

05:45:46.358 --> 05:45:47.326
PLANNING ON SUPPORTING THIS BILL

05:45:47.393 --> 05:45:49.895
TODAY. I'M GOING TO NOT VOTE,

05:45:49.962 --> 05:45:50.996
AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN WORK

05:45:51.063 --> 05:45:52.765
THROUGH MAYBE THE WAYS THAT WE

05:45:52.832 --> 05:45:54.066
CAN MAKE SURE THAT THE COST OF

05:45:54.133 --> 05:45:55.167
THIS TECHNOLOGY DOESN'T RISE. SO

05:45:55.234 --> 05:45:56.869
RURAL HOSPITALS AND RURAL

05:45:56.936 --> 05:45:58.270
PROVIDERS HAVE ACCESS TO IT AS

05:45:58.337 --> 05:46:00.206
WELL. BUT I KNOW THAT YOU ARE

05:46:00.272 --> 05:46:01.440
DEDICATED TO THIS AS I AM. SO

05:46:01.507 --> 05:46:03.242
BEST OF LUCK TO YOU AND THANK

05:46:03.309 --> 05:46:05.177
YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. YEAH,

05:46:05.244 --> 05:46:06.178
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, AGAIN, I

05:46:06.245 --> 05:46:09.615
WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND

05:46:09.682 --> 05:46:11.383
YOUR CHAIR WANT TO THANK THE

05:46:11.450 --> 05:46:13.185
COMMENTS HERE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER

05:46:13.252 --> 05:46:15.387
MACEDO, THAT WAS ALSO ONE OF MY

05:46:15.454 --> 05:46:17.223
CONCERNS WITH THE REQUIREMENT OF

05:46:17.289 --> 05:46:20.559
THE AUDIT. NOT EVERY HOSPITAL IS

05:46:20.626 --> 05:46:22.261
THE SAME. NOT EVERY CLINIC IS

05:46:22.328 --> 05:46:23.395
THE SAME. AND EVEN THOUGH WE

05:46:23.462 --> 05:46:25.231
HAVE PLACED IT ON DEPLOYERS, IT

05:46:25.297 --> 05:46:28.367
IS GOING TO ULTIMATELY COST THE

05:46:28.434 --> 05:46:30.536
PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY END UP

05:46:30.603 --> 05:46:32.671
PURCHASING THIS VERY MUCH NEEDED

05:46:32.738 --> 05:46:35.207
SYSTEM OR DEVELOPERS. EXCUSE ME,

05:46:35.274 --> 05:46:38.177
IT IS GOING TO END UP COSTING

05:46:38.244 --> 05:46:39.879
MORE FOR THE DEPLOYERS, AND WE

05:46:39.945 --> 05:46:42.448
DON'T WANT THAT IN ITSELF TO

05:46:42.515 --> 05:46:44.483
BECOME A SYSTEM OF INEQUITY

05:46:44.550 --> 05:46:46.986
WHERE SOME CAN PROPERLY USE THEM

05:46:47.052 --> 05:46:49.421
AND OTHERS CANNOT. SO HOPEFULLY

05:46:49.488 --> 05:46:51.824
WE WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE IN

05:46:51.891 --> 05:46:52.424
CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE THIS IS

05:46:52.491 --> 05:46:54.560
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. THANK YOU

05:46:54.627 --> 05:46:56.462
VERY MUCH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER, VICE

05:46:56.529 --> 05:46:57.997
CHAIR DIXON, FOR YOUR COMMENTS

05:46:58.063 --> 05:46:59.331
ABOUT THE SIMPLICITY OF THIS

05:46:59.398 --> 05:47:00.766
BILL. THIS IS A VERY, VERY

05:47:00.833 --> 05:47:02.968
COMPLICATED ISSUE. REALLY WANT

05:47:03.035 --> 05:47:05.538
TO THANK MY STAFF FOR WORKING SO

05:47:05.604 --> 05:47:07.673
HARD ON THIS BILL. IT IS

05:47:07.740 --> 05:47:10.843
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. HEALTHCARE

05:47:10.910 --> 05:47:12.745
IS AN AREA WHERE WE SHOULD BE

05:47:12.811 --> 05:47:14.780
STRIVING TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE

05:47:14.847 --> 05:47:16.549
IS GETTING THE BEST CARE AND

05:47:16.615 --> 05:47:17.783
BECOMING THE HEALTHIEST

05:47:17.850 --> 05:47:18.817
CALIFORNIA THAT THEY ARE,

05:47:18.884 --> 05:47:19.852
REGARDLESS OF THEIR RACE,

05:47:19.919 --> 05:47:21.654
GENDER, SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS,

05:47:21.720 --> 05:47:23.289
AND UNFORTUNATELY, WHAT WE HAVE

05:47:23.355 --> 05:47:25.658
SEEN IN THE PAST IS THAT THOSE

05:47:25.724 --> 05:47:27.726
BIASES HAVE COME INTO PLAY. AND

05:47:27.793 --> 05:47:29.562
WHAT YOU SEE WITH AI IS THAT IT

05:47:29.628 --> 05:47:32.031
IS ONLY AS GOOD AS WHAT KIND OF

05:47:32.097 --> 05:47:33.566
INFORMATION HAS BEEN PLACED INTO

05:47:33.632 --> 05:47:36.068
THE SYSTEM INITIALLY. AND SO IF

05:47:36.135 --> 05:47:37.403
BIASES HAVE BEEN PLACED IN THE

05:47:37.469 --> 05:47:39.605
SYSTEM INITIALLY, THEN THE

05:47:39.672 --> 05:47:41.240
OUTCOMES WILL BE BIASED. BUT IF

05:47:41.307 --> 05:47:43.309
YOU HAVE A SYSTEM THAT IS

05:47:43.375 --> 05:47:44.677
ACTUALLY LOOKING INTO THAT TO

05:47:44.743 --> 05:47:47.012
ENSURE AND TO TEST ON A REGULAR

05:47:47.079 --> 05:47:48.347
BASIS THAT THERE IS NO BIAS,

05:47:48.414 --> 05:47:50.149
THEN YOU DON'T END UP WITH THE

05:47:50.216 --> 05:47:51.850
SAME KIND OF UNINTENDED

05:47:51.917 --> 05:47:53.052
CONSEQUENCES THAT WE HAVE SEEN

05:47:53.118 --> 05:47:54.820
THAT HAVE BEEN LAID OUT IN THE

05:47:54.887 --> 05:47:56.222
ANALYSIS, BUT OTHERS HAVE JUST

05:47:56.288 --> 05:47:58.791
LIVED AND EXPERIENCED,

05:47:58.857 --> 05:47:59.959
UNFORTUNATELY, WITH THEIR

05:48:00.025 --> 05:48:01.293
EXPERIENCE IN THE HEALTH CARE

05:48:01.360 --> 05:48:03.128
SYSTEM. I WANT TO THANK CMA FOR

05:48:03.195 --> 05:48:04.897
BEING HERE AND BY AND BY MY

05:48:04.964 --> 05:48:06.599
SIDES AND THOSE WHO HAD REALLY

05:48:06.665 --> 05:48:10.002
SUPPORTED STRONGLY PRIOR TO THE

05:48:10.069 --> 05:48:11.103
AMENDMENT, BECAUSE THEY

05:48:11.170 --> 05:48:12.404
UNDERSTAND AS WELL THE

05:48:12.471 --> 05:48:13.172
IMPORTANCE THIS IS WITHIN THE

05:48:13.239 --> 05:48:15.341
HEALTH CARE SPACE. AND SO AS WE

05:48:15.407 --> 05:48:16.775
CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS BILL,

05:48:16.842 --> 05:48:18.210
WHICH IS A PRIORITY OF THE

05:48:18.277 --> 05:48:19.211
CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK

05:48:19.278 --> 05:48:21.213
CAUCUS, I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN

05:48:21.280 --> 05:48:23.282
COME TO A PLACE AND CRAFT A BILL

05:48:23.349 --> 05:48:24.350
THAT REALLY DOES WORK FOR

05:48:24.416 --> 05:48:25.551
EVERYONE, BECAUSE AT THE END OF

05:48:25.618 --> 05:48:28.220
THE DAY, WE'RE TRYING TO DO THE

05:48:28.287 --> 05:48:30.055
BEST THAT WE CAN TO HAVE THE

05:48:30.122 --> 05:48:30.689
BEST HEALTH CARE OUTCOMES FOR

05:48:30.756 --> 05:48:32.391
THE PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE. AND

05:48:32.458 --> 05:48:34.927
FOR THAT, I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR

05:48:34.994 --> 05:48:38.397
AN AYE VOTE ON SB 503. THANK

05:48:38.464 --> 05:48:41.934
YOU. DO WE HAVE A MOTION?

05:48:42.001 --> 05:48:44.803
SECOND. OH, DID YOU ALREADY MOVE

05:48:44.870 --> 05:48:46.639

05:48:46.705 --> 05:48:47.940
A THIRD AND A FOURTH. LET'S CALL

05:48:48.007 --> 05:48:50.609
THE ROLL. SORRY ABOUT THAT.

05:48:50.676 --> 05:48:52.411
DIDN'T MEAN TO DISMISS YOUR

05:48:52.478 --> 05:48:55.247
MOTION. LET'S CALL THE ROLL.

05:48:55.314 --> 05:48:58.150

SENATOR WEBER PEARSON. THE

05:48:59.518 --> 05:49:01.587
MOTION IS DUE PASS, AS AMENDED

05:49:01.654 --> 05:49:02.454

WE'LL KEEP IT OPEN FOR ABSENT

05:49:35.554 --> 05:49:36.989
MEMBERS. THANK YOU, DOCTOR

05:49:37.056 --> 05:49:38.357
PEARSON. SENATOR ARAGON, I

05:49:38.424 --> 05:49:40.559
APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE. I

05:49:40.626 --> 05:49:47.466
KNOW. WE HAVE SB 524. IT'S WELL

05:49:47.533 --> 05:49:52.504
WORTH THE WAIT. I LEARNED A LOT.

05:49:52.571 --> 05:49:54.406
Ó. I'M HAPPY TO PRESENT MY LAST

05:49:54.473 --> 05:49:55.641
BILL BEFORE AN ASSEMBLY

05:49:55.708 --> 05:49:59.044
COMMITTEE, AND HAPPY TO BE HERE

05:49:59.111 --> 05:50:00.012
BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY PRIVACY

05:50:00.079 --> 05:50:01.880
COMMITTEE TO PRESENT SENATE BILL

05:50:01.947 --> 05:50:05.150
524. I WANT TO FIRST STATE THAT

05:50:05.217 --> 05:50:06.919
I'M ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE

05:50:06.985 --> 05:50:08.954
AMENDMENTS, WHICH LIMIT

05:50:09.021 --> 05:50:10.856
CONTRACTED VENDORS FROM SHARING

05:50:10.923 --> 05:50:12.991
AND SELLING DATA OBTAINED

05:50:13.058 --> 05:50:14.760
THROUGH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

05:50:14.827 --> 05:50:16.161
TO UNPERMITTED PARTIES. WHAT

05:50:16.228 --> 05:50:18.364
THOSE AMENDMENTS WOULD DO IS

05:50:18.430 --> 05:50:20.899
ENSURE THAT ANY DATA THAT'S

05:50:20.966 --> 05:50:23.502
COLLECTED FROM A LAW ENFORCEMENT

05:50:23.569 --> 05:50:24.236
AGENCY CAN ONLY BE SHARED FOR

05:50:24.303 --> 05:50:24.770
LEGITIMATE LAW ENFORCEMENT

05:50:24.837 --> 05:50:27.106
PURPOSES, BECAUSE SOME OF THIS

05:50:27.172 --> 05:50:28.674
DATA IS ACTUALLY USED TO TRAIN

05:50:28.741 --> 05:50:30.743
AI TOOLS. SO I APPRECIATE THE

05:50:30.809 --> 05:50:32.444
COMMITTEE BRINGING THIS TO OUR

05:50:32.511 --> 05:50:33.112
ATTENTION AND CONVERSATIONS WITH

05:50:33.178 --> 05:50:34.780
AXON AND SOME OF THE VENDORS

05:50:34.847 --> 05:50:36.014
THAT USE THIS TECHNOLOGY. AND I

05:50:36.081 --> 05:50:38.217
THINK THIS IS A GOOD AMENDMENT

05:50:38.283 --> 05:50:42.821
THAT WILL FURTHER PROTECT THE

05:50:42.888 --> 05:50:43.655
SENSITIVITY OF THIS IMPORTANT

05:50:43.722 --> 05:50:47.359
DATA. AND I WANT TO THANK THE

05:50:47.426 --> 05:50:48.460
COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING

05:50:48.527 --> 05:50:49.228
DILIGENTLY WITH MY OFFICE AND

05:50:49.294 --> 05:50:51.697
THE SPONSORS AND STAKEHOLDERS TO

05:50:51.764 --> 05:50:52.765
ENSURE THAT ALL PERSPECTIVES

05:50:52.831 --> 05:50:53.699
WERE CONSIDERED AND CONCERNS

05:50:53.766 --> 05:50:54.433
WERE THOUGHTFULLY ADDRESSED. AND

05:50:54.500 --> 05:50:56.635
I JUST WANT TO ALSO THANK THE

05:50:56.702 --> 05:50:58.704
VARIOUS LAW ENFORCEMENT

05:50:58.771 --> 05:50:59.838
ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE'VE ENGAGED

05:50:59.905 --> 05:51:00.906
WITH FROM THE VERY BEGINNING,

05:51:00.973 --> 05:51:02.708
SOME OF WHICH YOU'LL HEAR FROM

05:51:02.775 --> 05:51:04.209
TODAY. THEY'RE NOT QUITE AT THE

05:51:04.276 --> 05:51:05.944
POINT WHERE THEY'RE NEUTRAL, BUT

05:51:06.011 --> 05:51:06.745
WE'RE CONTINUING TO MEET WITH

05:51:06.812 --> 05:51:08.247
THEM AND WORK WITH THEM. THEY

05:51:08.313 --> 05:51:09.348
WERE ENGAGING WITH MY OFFICE AND

05:51:09.415 --> 05:51:11.417
COMMITTEE STAFF ON THE

05:51:11.483 --> 05:51:12.050
AMENDMENTS. I FELT IT WAS

05:51:12.117 --> 05:51:13.118
IMPORTANT THAT THEIR INPUT

05:51:13.185 --> 05:51:14.186
INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE

05:51:14.253 --> 05:51:15.521
AMENDMENTS, AND WE CONTINUE TO

05:51:15.587 --> 05:51:17.189
COMMIT, IF THIS BILL OUT OF

05:51:17.256 --> 05:51:18.424
COMMITTEE, TO WORK WITH OUR LAW

05:51:18.490 --> 05:51:19.324
ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS, BECAUSE AT

05:51:19.391 --> 05:51:22.694
THE END OF THE DAY, WE WANT THIS

05:51:22.761 --> 05:51:23.195
TO WORK. YOU KNOW, IT'S

05:51:23.262 --> 05:51:24.229
IMPORTANT FOR TRANSPARENCY AND

05:51:24.296 --> 05:51:25.063
ACCOUNTABILITY, BUT WE WANT IT

05:51:25.130 --> 05:51:26.532
TO BE WORKABLE FOR THOSE LAW

05:51:26.598 --> 05:51:28.167
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AS WELL,

05:51:28.233 --> 05:51:28.801
GIVEN THE RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS

05:51:28.867 --> 05:51:31.437
THAT THEY'RE FACING. SO SB 524

05:51:31.503 --> 05:51:32.571
WOULD REQUIRE LAW ENFORCEMENT

05:51:32.638 --> 05:51:34.006
AGENCIES CURRENTLY USING

05:51:34.072 --> 05:51:36.175
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THEIR

05:51:36.241 --> 05:51:38.644
REPORT WRITING PROCESSES TO

05:51:38.710 --> 05:51:40.145
MAINTAIN A POLICY DISCLOSING

05:51:40.212 --> 05:51:41.880
WHETHER A REPORT WAS WRITTEN

05:51:41.947 --> 05:51:44.450
EITHER FULLY OR IN PART USING

05:51:44.516 --> 05:51:46.151
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. THIS

05:51:46.218 --> 05:51:47.719
BILL SEEKS TO ENSURE

05:51:47.786 --> 05:51:49.087
TRANSPARENCY AND ACCURACY BY

05:51:49.154 --> 05:51:50.589
ADDING CRITICAL SAFEGUARDS IN

05:51:50.656 --> 05:51:53.225
THE REPORT WRITING PROCESS. WHEN

05:51:53.292 --> 05:51:56.028
USED PROPERLY, AI CAN BE USEFUL

05:51:56.094 --> 05:51:57.429
FOR TASKS. TASKS SUCH AS

05:51:57.496 --> 05:51:59.431
RESEARCH AND ANALYTICS, AND WITH

05:51:59.498 --> 05:52:01.200
THE USE OF AI INCREASING, IT'S

05:52:01.266 --> 05:52:03.101
ALSO BEGAN TO BE USED IN LAW

05:52:03.168 --> 05:52:04.636
ENFORCEMENT, FROM HELPING WITH

05:52:04.703 --> 05:52:05.704
ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES TO HELPING

05:52:05.771 --> 05:52:07.940
WITH INVESTIGATIONS. AND I THINK

05:52:08.006 --> 05:52:09.775
THAT'S IMPORTANT. DESPITE THIS,

05:52:09.842 --> 05:52:11.844
THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS OVER THE

05:52:11.910 --> 05:52:14.046
AI'S ACCURACY. TAKE, FOR

05:52:14.112 --> 05:52:15.314
EXAMPLE, WHEN AI IS USED TO

05:52:15.380 --> 05:52:17.149
GENERATE A RESPONSE TO MESSAGES

05:52:17.216 --> 05:52:18.317
OR DRAFT A COVER LETTER, OR EVEN

05:52:18.383 --> 05:52:20.786
WHEN IT'S USED FOR VOICE

05:52:20.853 --> 05:52:22.221
DICTATION ON OUR PHONE. MORE

05:52:22.287 --> 05:52:24.022
OFTEN THAN NOT, WE HAVE TO

05:52:24.089 --> 05:52:25.591
REVIEW THAT RESPONSE FOR

05:52:25.657 --> 05:52:27.192
ACCURACY. HUMAN VERIFICATION AND

05:52:27.259 --> 05:52:28.827
JUDGMENT IS STILL NECESSARY IN

05:52:28.894 --> 05:52:31.296
THE USE OF AI, AND THIS IS

05:52:31.363 --> 05:52:32.698
ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR POLICE

05:52:32.764 --> 05:52:34.099
REPORTS BECAUSE PROSECUTORS,

05:52:34.166 --> 05:52:35.968
DEFENSE ATTORNEYS, AND COURTS

05:52:36.034 --> 05:52:38.103
RELY HEAVILY ON POLICE REPORTS

05:52:38.170 --> 05:52:39.271
TO DETERMINE CRIMINAL OUTCOMES.

05:52:39.338 --> 05:52:40.839
AND IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT

05:52:40.906 --> 05:52:42.875
THAT ADDITIONAL TOOLS USED TO

05:52:42.941 --> 05:52:44.877
GENERATE AN OFFICIAL REPORT IS

05:52:44.943 --> 05:52:46.411
ACCURATE TO PREVENT SOMEONE'S

05:52:46.478 --> 05:52:47.779
LIVELIHOOD FROM BEING WRONGLY

05:52:47.846 --> 05:52:49.581
IMPACTED. WE'VE BEEN WORKING

05:52:49.648 --> 05:52:50.682
CLOSELY WITH OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT

05:52:50.749 --> 05:52:52.417
PARTNERS TO ADDRESS SOME OF

05:52:52.484 --> 05:52:53.919
THEIR ONGOING CONCERNS, AND HAVE

05:52:53.986 --> 05:52:54.453
NARROWED THE SCOPES OF THE

05:52:54.520 --> 05:52:56.154
DRAFTS THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO

05:52:56.221 --> 05:52:57.623
BE RETAINED IN THE BILL. IN

05:52:57.689 --> 05:52:58.957
ADDITION, WE HAVE CLARIFIED THAT

05:52:59.024 --> 05:53:00.826
A DRAFT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN

05:53:00.893 --> 05:53:02.961
OFFICER'S OFFICIAL STATEMENT TO

05:53:03.028 --> 05:53:05.898
PROTECT THOSE OFFICERS FROM

05:53:05.964 --> 05:53:07.266
LIABILITY AS WELL. I LOOK

POLICE DEPARTMENTS TO AUTOMATE

05:53:37.763 --> 05:53:39.598
THE CREATION OF POLICE REPORTS,

05:53:39.665 --> 05:53:41.466
AIMING TO SAVE OFFICERS TIME,

ENHANCE CONSISTENCY AND IMPROVE

05:53:44.036 --> 05:53:45.337
EFFICACY. HOWEVER, THE SYSTEMS

05:53:45.404 --> 05:53:47.172
BEING USED LACK TRANSPARENCY AND

05:53:47.239 --> 05:53:48.307
AUDIT TRAILS, MAKING IT

05:53:48.373 --> 05:53:50.208
DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHAT WAS

05:53:50.275 --> 05:53:51.977
WRITTEN BY AI AND WHAT WAS ADDED

05:53:52.044 --> 05:53:54.012
BY THE OFFICER. NEITHER THE

05:53:54.079 --> 05:53:55.080
INDIVIDUAL NOR THEIR ATTORNEY

05:53:55.147 --> 05:53:56.882
HAS ANY IDEA THAT AI IS BEING

05:53:56.949 --> 05:53:58.417
USED, WHICH PROGRAM IS BEING

05:53:58.483 --> 05:53:59.818
USED, AND WHETHER THE POLICE

05:53:59.885 --> 05:54:01.653
OFFICER OR THEIR SUPERIORS HAS

05:54:01.720 --> 05:54:03.522
REJECTED THE AI VERSION AND MADE

05:54:03.589 --> 05:54:04.723
CHANGES TO THE REPORT AND WHAT

05:54:04.790 --> 05:54:06.625
THOSE CHANGES ARE. TRANSPARENCY

05:54:06.692 --> 05:54:08.393
IS CRUCIAL IN THE CRIMINAL

05:54:08.460 --> 05:54:09.294
JUSTICE SYSTEM, AND THE USE OF

05:54:09.361 --> 05:54:11.396
AI IN POLICE REPORTS CAN

05:54:11.463 --> 05:54:12.864
COMPLICATE THIS IF NOT

PARTICULARLY IN LEGAL

05:54:20.405 --> 05:54:23.141
PROCEEDINGS. SB 524 SOLVES THIS

05:54:23.208 --> 05:54:24.309
PROBLEM, BUT IT'S SILENT ON

05:54:24.376 --> 05:54:26.678
WHETHER OR NOT I SHOULD BE USED

05:54:26.745 --> 05:54:27.980
BY LAW ENFORCEMENT OR IF IT

05:54:28.046 --> 05:54:29.147
CREATES A BIAS. IT SIMPLY

05:54:29.214 --> 05:54:30.549
PROVIDES CLEAR GUIDELINES WHEN

05:54:30.616 --> 05:54:32.985
IT IS USED. KNOWING WHEN AI IS

05:54:33.051 --> 05:54:34.686
USED ENABLES BETTER SCRUTINY,

05:54:34.753 --> 05:54:35.754
PROMOTES FAIRNESS AND

05:54:35.821 --> 05:54:36.688

IN SUPPORT OF SB 524, WHICH

05:54:50.702 --> 05:54:52.604
WOULD PUT MUCH NEEDED GUARDRAILS

05:54:52.671 --> 05:54:53.905
ON A TECHNOLOGY THAT CURRENTLY

05:54:53.972 --> 05:54:56.675
HAS NONE, EFF HAS WRITTEN

05:54:56.742 --> 05:54:58.110
EXTENSIVELY ABOUT WHAT CAN GO

05:54:58.176 --> 05:54:59.978
WRONG WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT

05:55:00.045 --> 05:55:02.447
AGENCIES USE AI TO WRITE POLICE

05:55:02.514 --> 05:55:04.983
REPORTS. THIS INCLUDES A LOSS OF

05:55:05.050 --> 05:55:05.984
ACCOUNTABILITY AND ACCURACY

05:55:06.051 --> 05:55:08.520
ABOUT WHAT HAS REALLY HAPPENED.

ALREADY USING THE TECH FOUND

05:55:13.725 --> 05:55:15.260

DELIBERATELY DESIGNED TO AVOID

AUDITS THAT COULD PROVIDE ANY

05:55:24.069 --> 05:55:25.370
ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE PUBLIC. WE

05:55:25.437 --> 05:55:27.005
BELIEVE THERE ARE TOO MANY

05:55:27.072 --> 05:55:28.507
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW I

05:55:28.573 --> 05:55:30.575
WOULD TRANSLATE THE AUDIO OF

05:55:30.642 --> 05:55:32.277

05:55:32.344 --> 05:55:33.745
EXTENT TO WHICH POLICE WILL

05:55:33.812 --> 05:55:35.580
ACTUALLY EDIT OR CORRECT THOSE

05:55:35.647 --> 05:55:37.416
DRAFTS. ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS

05:55:37.482 --> 05:55:39.151
CURRENTLY NO WAY FOR THE PUBLIC

05:55:39.217 --> 05:55:40.585
TO RELIABLY DISCERN WHAT WAS

05:55:40.652 --> 05:55:42.421
WRITTEN BY A PERSON AND WHAT WAS

05:55:42.487 --> 05:55:45.290
WRITTEN BY A COMPUTER. AB 524

05:55:45.357 --> 05:55:47.059
WOULD MITIGATE SOME OF THESE

05:55:47.125 --> 05:55:49.995
HARMS. ANY NEW, UNTESTED, AND

05:55:50.062 --> 05:55:51.697
PROBLEMATIC TECHNOLOGY NEEDS A

05:55:51.763 --> 05:55:53.231
ROBUST PROCESS TO EVALUATE ITS

05:55:53.298 --> 05:55:55.600
USE BY OFFICERS, ENSURING THAT

05:55:55.667 --> 05:55:57.269
THERE IS AN AUDIT TRAIL FOR

05:55:57.335 --> 05:55:58.670

05:55:58.737 --> 05:56:00.706

CITIES AND STATES ACROSS THE

05:56:02.307 --> 05:56:03.675
COUNTRY ARE CONSIDERING

05:56:03.742 --> 05:56:05.110
GUARDRAILS TO ADDRESS THE IMPACT

05:56:05.177 --> 05:56:06.912
THIS TECHNOLOGY MAY HAVE ON OUR

05:56:06.978 --> 05:56:08.814
JUDICIAL SYSTEM, AND IT'S

05:56:08.880 --> 05:56:10.115
IMPORTANT THAT CALIFORNIA MOVES

05:56:10.182 --> 05:56:12.984

05:56:13.051 --> 05:56:14.553
EMERGING POLICE TECHNOLOGY THAT

05:56:14.619 --> 05:56:16.354

LIBERTARIAN, I WANT TO MAKE SURE

05:58:22.080 --> 05:58:25.550
THAT WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT. DOES

05:58:25.617 --> 05:58:27.319
AN INVESTIGATION, MAKES A

05:58:27.385 --> 05:58:31.289
REPORT, MAKES A CLAIM THAT IT'S

05:58:31.356 --> 05:58:32.424
LEGITIMATE AND WE DON'T HAVE A

05:58:32.490 --> 05:58:36.328
RISK OF. SOMETHING GOING AWRY OR

05:58:36.394 --> 05:58:39.231
LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY. THERE

05:58:39.297 --> 05:58:41.233
WAS A COMMENT IN THE MATERIALS,

05:58:41.299 --> 05:58:42.601
THE BACKUP MATERIALS THAT SAID

05:58:42.667 --> 05:58:44.369
THAT THERE WAS A CONCERN THAT

05:58:44.436 --> 05:58:46.071
MAYBE IF YOU USED GRAMMAR CHECK

05:58:46.137 --> 05:58:48.173
ON A REPORT, THAT THAT SOMEHOW

05:58:48.240 --> 05:58:50.609
WOULD NOT BE COMPLIANT WITH YOUR

05:58:50.675 --> 05:58:53.211
LAW. CAN YOU SPECIFICALLY

05:58:53.278 --> 05:58:55.046
RESPOND TO THAT EXAMPLE? SURE.

05:58:55.113 --> 05:58:57.916
WOULD GRAMMAR CHECK TRIGGER THIS

05:58:57.983 --> 05:59:00.385
REQUIREMENT? NO. YOU KNOW, THE

05:59:00.452 --> 05:59:02.120
BILL'S INTENDED FOCUS IS ON

05:59:02.187 --> 05:59:04.422
SPECIFIC AI ASSISTED SOFTWARE

05:59:04.489 --> 05:59:05.590
THAT'S CURRENTLY BEING UTILIZED.

05:59:05.657 --> 05:59:06.591
AND REALLY, THERE'S ONE

05:59:06.658 --> 05:59:09.127
PRINCIPAL TOOL BY AXON TO WHICH

05:59:09.194 --> 05:59:10.428
WE'VE BEEN MEETING WITH

05:59:10.495 --> 05:59:12.163
THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE PROCESS.

05:59:12.230 --> 05:59:14.065
IT DOESN'T INCLUDE, YOU KNOW,

05:59:14.132 --> 05:59:16.268
TRADITIONAL WORD PROCESSORS,

05:59:16.334 --> 05:59:17.969
OTHER TYPES OF SORT OF GRAMMAR

05:59:18.036 --> 05:59:20.372
CHECK TECHNOLOGY. SO THAT THAT'S

05:59:20.438 --> 05:59:21.706
REALLY THE WE'VE TRIED TO CRAFT

05:59:21.773 --> 05:59:24.476
THIS TO NARROWLY FOCUS ON. AND

05:59:24.542 --> 05:59:26.311
MOREOVER, THE DEFINITION OF

05:59:26.378 --> 05:59:28.914
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE

05:59:28.980 --> 05:59:33.118
BILL. SPECIFICALLY, I THINK

05:59:33.184 --> 05:59:35.654
ADDRESSES THAT. AND THEN FOR THE

05:59:35.720 --> 05:59:38.256
OPPOSITION, YOUR AMENDMENTS OR

05:59:38.323 --> 05:59:39.658
REFINEMENTS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING

05:59:39.724 --> 05:59:41.526
FOR, IS THAT THE SPACE THAT

05:59:41.593 --> 05:59:43.628
YOU'RE TRYING TO HONE IN ON? NO,

05:59:43.695 --> 05:59:45.130
I AGREE, WE ADDRESSED THAT ISSUE

05:59:45.196 --> 05:59:47.532
EARLIER IN THE YEAR WITH THE

05:59:47.599 --> 05:59:48.066
DEFINITION OF ARTIFICIAL

05:59:48.133 --> 05:59:50.068

05:59:50.135 --> 05:59:51.336
WHAT ARE THE ADDITIONS WE'RE

05:59:51.403 --> 05:59:54.072
LOOKING FOR. SO THE BILL REFERS

05:59:54.139 --> 05:59:55.507
TO OFFICIAL DRAFT, OFFICIAL

05:59:55.573 --> 05:59:57.375
REPORT, FINAL REPORT, INTERIM

05:59:57.442 --> 05:59:59.244
DRAFT AND DRAFT. SO THERE'S FOUR

05:59:59.311 --> 06:00:00.812
DIFFERENT TERMS THAT ARE USED.

06:00:00.879 --> 06:00:02.080
AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

06:00:02.147 --> 06:00:03.782
THERE'S REALLY WE'RE TALKING

06:00:03.848 --> 06:00:04.582
ABOUT THE OFFICIAL REPORT WHICH

06:00:04.649 --> 06:00:06.051
IS THE FINAL THE FINAL AND THEN

06:00:06.117 --> 06:00:07.319
THE DRAFT. AND WANTING TO MAKE

06:00:07.385 --> 06:00:09.254
SURE THAT THE DRAFT IS PURELY

06:00:09.321 --> 06:00:10.255
WHAT THE AI SYSTEM SPITS OUT

06:00:10.322 --> 06:00:12.757
WITH NO HUMAN INTERVENTION, AND

06:00:12.824 --> 06:00:14.259
MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE CLEAR ON

06:00:14.326 --> 06:00:15.460
THAT. SO IT'S MORE JUST PUTTING

06:00:15.527 --> 06:00:16.895
SOME DEFINITIONS. SO THE

06:00:16.962 --> 06:00:17.829
CONSISTENT TERMS, THE

06:00:17.896 --> 06:00:18.496
CLARIFICATION THAT YOU'RE

06:00:18.563 --> 06:00:20.298
LOOKING AT REALLY WOULD APPLY

06:00:20.365 --> 06:00:23.501
THE BILL TO THE FINAL REPORT.

06:00:23.568 --> 06:00:25.737
YES. YEAH. OKAY. THE OFFICIAL

06:00:25.804 --> 06:00:27.005
REPORT, WHICH IS THE FINAL DRAFT

06:00:27.072 --> 06:00:28.940
SIGNED OFF BY THE OFFICER. WE DO

06:00:29.007 --> 06:00:30.475
THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO

06:00:30.542 --> 06:00:31.943
HAVE SOME GUARDRAILS AROUND

06:00:32.010 --> 06:00:32.610
HERE. AND THERE WAS AN AMENDMENT

06:00:32.677 --> 06:00:34.179
PUT IN EARLIER TO MAKE SURE THAT

06:00:34.245 --> 06:00:36.348
THE OFFICER SIGNS OFF ON THE

06:00:36.414 --> 06:00:37.015
FINAL REPORT, SO THAT THEY DID

06:00:37.082 --> 06:00:39.317
ACTUALLY PUT EYES ON IT AND THEY

06:00:39.384 --> 06:00:40.885
APPROVE IT. WE WORKED ON OTHER

06:00:40.952 --> 06:00:42.354
ISSUES. BUT YEAH, THAT'S KIND OF

06:00:42.420 --> 06:00:44.089
WHAT WE'RE THE LAST LITTLE BIT

06:00:44.155 --> 06:00:45.357
THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. I KNOW

06:00:45.423 --> 06:00:46.758
OUR REPUBLICAN CAUCUS HAS AN

06:00:46.825 --> 06:00:47.726
OPPOSED RECOMMENDATION ON THE

06:00:47.792 --> 06:00:49.094
BILL. I'M PERFECTLY FINE

06:00:49.160 --> 06:00:50.328
SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY IN THE

06:00:50.395 --> 06:00:51.830
HOPES THAT YOU'LL CONTINUE TO

06:00:51.896 --> 06:00:54.632
REFINE THE LANGUAGE AND LISTEN

06:00:54.699 --> 06:00:56.001
TO LAW ENFORCEMENT'S INPUT.

06:00:56.067 --> 06:00:58.803
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

06:00:58.870 --> 06:01:02.173
SO, MEMBER WILSON, THANK YOU TO

06:01:02.240 --> 06:01:04.009
THE AUTHOR BRINGING FORWARD I

06:01:04.075 --> 06:01:06.411
MISSED. DID WE ALREADY HAVE A

06:01:06.478 --> 06:01:07.946
MOTION SO MOVED OKAY. WELL THEN

06:01:08.013 --> 06:01:11.750
I'LL SECOND. FOR BRINGING THIS

06:01:11.816 --> 06:01:13.985
FORWARD. SO WHEN I WAS SO I

06:01:14.052 --> 06:01:16.054
UNDERSTOOD THE INTENT WHEN I WAS

06:01:16.121 --> 06:01:17.389
GETTING BRIEFED ON THE BILL AND

06:01:17.455 --> 06:01:18.990
READING THE BILL, ONE OF THE

06:01:19.057 --> 06:01:20.759
THINGS THAT I HAD CONCERN AND

06:01:20.825 --> 06:01:23.261
FLAGGED FOR ME WAS COMING FROM

06:01:23.328 --> 06:01:26.297
LOCAL GOV AND BEING INVOLVED IN

06:01:26.364 --> 06:01:27.732
SEVERAL LAWSUITS AGAINST THE

06:01:27.799 --> 06:01:28.733
CITY, INCLUDING THOSE AGAINST

06:01:28.800 --> 06:01:30.635
OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT. AND, YOU

06:01:30.702 --> 06:01:31.936
KNOW, ALL OF THAT STUFF WAS THIS

06:01:32.003 --> 06:01:34.472
THING ABOUT DRAFT AND

06:01:34.539 --> 06:01:35.640
UNDERSTANDING THAT WHEN

06:01:35.707 --> 06:01:38.109
SOMETHING ISN'T DRAFT FORM, IT'S

06:01:38.176 --> 06:01:40.678
DRAFT, AND IT'S WHEN YOU MAKE

06:01:40.745 --> 06:01:42.013
SOMETHING FINAL AND SIGN YOUR

06:01:42.080 --> 06:01:44.182
NAME AND ATTEST TO IT, WHICH I

06:01:44.249 --> 06:01:45.016
BELIEVE WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH

06:01:45.083 --> 06:01:48.153
POLICE OFFICERS WHEN THEY'RE

06:01:48.219 --> 06:01:49.154
WHEN THERE'S A REPORT, BECAUSE

06:01:49.220 --> 06:01:51.456
WE'VE SEEN A FEW OF THEM BEING

06:01:51.523 --> 06:01:52.557
INVOLVED IN THESE TYPES OF

06:01:52.624 --> 06:01:54.592
LAWSUITS OR INVESTIGATIVE THINGS

06:01:54.659 --> 06:01:57.295
WHERE THEY'RE ATTESTING TO THAT,

06:01:57.362 --> 06:01:58.530
AND IT BECOMES THAT OWNERSHIP.

06:01:58.596 --> 06:02:00.532
AND SO IT IS HELPFUL TO KNOW

06:02:00.598 --> 06:02:01.900
THAT IF SOMETHING WAS DRAFTED

06:02:01.966 --> 06:02:04.002
AND FULL AND PART OF I. BUT I'M

06:02:04.069 --> 06:02:05.503
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE PURPOSE

06:02:05.570 --> 06:02:09.441
OF THE DRAFT VERSION MORE THAN

06:02:09.507 --> 06:02:11.209
THE DISTINCTION OF, OH, WE JUST

06:02:11.276 --> 06:02:12.310
WANT TO KNOW, BECAUSE I FEEL

06:02:12.377 --> 06:02:14.412
LIKE THAT COULD BE BROUGHT INTO

06:02:14.479 --> 06:02:15.980
SOME TYPE OF LIABILITY

06:02:16.047 --> 06:02:17.315
SITUATION. HAVING SEEN PEOPLE

06:02:17.382 --> 06:02:18.516
TRYING TO DISCOVER LIKE WHAT WAS

06:02:18.583 --> 06:02:20.452
THE DRAFT, WHAT WAS THE THOUGHT

06:02:20.518 --> 06:02:21.419
PROCESS AND THAT REALLY THAT

06:02:21.486 --> 06:02:23.455
PART JUST ON MY OWN. BEFORE

06:02:23.521 --> 06:02:25.323
READING, EVEN THE OPPOSITION

06:02:25.390 --> 06:02:26.658
CONCERNED ME JUST HAVING BEEN

06:02:26.724 --> 06:02:28.960
INVOLVED IN A FEW OF THESE

06:02:29.027 --> 06:02:30.562
SITUATIONS WHERE WHAT WAS THE

06:02:30.628 --> 06:02:32.097
ORIGINAL, NOT WHAT WAS TESTED

06:02:32.163 --> 06:02:34.332
TO, BUT WHAT WAS IT, YOU KNOW,

06:02:34.399 --> 06:02:36.367
THE ITERATIONS THAT LED TO THAT

06:02:36.434 --> 06:02:38.203
POINT. AND SO CAN YOU CAN YOU

06:02:38.269 --> 06:02:40.738
SPEAK TO WHY THE DRAFT THING

06:02:40.805 --> 06:02:43.074
BEYOND JUST I WANT TO KNOW WHERE

06:02:43.141 --> 06:02:44.309
IT CAME FROM, BECAUSE THAT COULD

06:02:44.375 --> 06:02:47.278
BE THE SAME THING. IF YOU HAD

06:02:47.345 --> 06:02:48.213
TWO OFFICERS AND THEY'RE LEADING

06:02:48.279 --> 06:02:49.114
OFF A REPORT, THE DISTINCTION

06:02:49.180 --> 06:02:50.682
BETWEEN THE TWO. WHY WHY WOULD

06:02:50.748 --> 06:02:51.916
THAT BE IMPORTANT? YEAH. THE

06:02:51.983 --> 06:02:53.084
BILL DOES A COUPLE THINGS. ONE

06:02:53.151 --> 06:02:55.086
REQUIRES THE DISCLAIMER ON EACH

06:02:55.153 --> 06:02:57.355
PAGE OF THE REPORT TO INDICATE

06:02:57.422 --> 06:02:59.491
WHETHER I WAS USED. AND THEN

06:02:59.557 --> 06:03:00.892
TWO, THE RETENTION, THE DRAFTS.

06:03:00.959 --> 06:03:02.093
AND I THINK THE RETENTION THE

06:03:02.160 --> 06:03:04.129
DRAFTS IS REALLY IMPORTANT

06:03:04.195 --> 06:03:05.263
BECAUSE IT CONSTITUTES A HISTORY

06:03:05.330 --> 06:03:11.536
OF THE DOCUMENT. AND. AND, YOU

06:03:11.603 --> 06:03:14.305
KNOW, SHOULD THERE BE A NEED TO

06:03:14.372 --> 06:03:15.974
DISTINGUISH WHAT I PRODUCED,

06:03:16.040 --> 06:03:17.909
WHICH WOULD BE IN THE FIRST

06:03:17.976 --> 06:03:19.177
DRAFT TO WHAT THE OFFICIAL

06:03:19.244 --> 06:03:20.879
REPORT ULTIMATELY REFLECTS,

06:03:20.945 --> 06:03:22.447
WHICH REQUIRES, I THINK

06:03:22.514 --> 06:03:23.915
ULTIMATELY REVIEW BY THE

06:03:23.982 --> 06:03:26.718
OFFICER? I THINK THE INTENT IS

06:03:26.784 --> 06:03:28.953
TO HAVE A PAPER TRAIL

06:03:29.020 --> 06:03:30.455
DOCUMENTING HOW A RESULTS IN THE

06:03:30.522 --> 06:03:32.490
WHAT DO YOU GET, HOW THAT COULD

06:03:32.557 --> 06:03:34.726
BE AN ISSUE AND LIABILITY. OKAY.

06:03:34.792 --> 06:03:39.430
SECTION 13 6663A2 REQUIRING THE

06:03:39.497 --> 06:03:41.166
SIGNATURE OF A LAW ENFORCEMENT

06:03:41.232 --> 06:03:42.467
OFFICER OR MEMBER OF A LAW

06:03:42.534 --> 06:03:43.601
ENFORCEMENT AGENCY WHO PREPARED

06:03:43.668 --> 06:03:46.204
THE FINAL REPORT. AND SO BY

06:03:46.271 --> 06:03:47.338
REQUIRING THAT THERE HAS TO BE

06:03:47.405 --> 06:03:49.140
SIGN OFF AND MR. FELDMAN CAN

06:03:49.207 --> 06:03:50.308
ELABORATE. NO, NO, NO, I THINK

06:03:50.375 --> 06:03:52.043
WE'RE MISSING MAYBE THE POINT OF

06:03:52.110 --> 06:03:54.479
MINE AND MAYBE I'M NOT MAKING IT

06:03:54.546 --> 06:03:55.580
CLEAR AND I'M SUPPORTING THE

06:03:55.647 --> 06:03:57.182
BILL. THAT'S WHY I WAS ASKING

06:03:57.248 --> 06:03:58.883
ABOUT THE MOTION. SO IT REALLY

06:03:58.950 --> 06:04:00.051
IS ABOUT GETTING TO THE FINE

06:04:00.118 --> 06:04:03.555
TUNE. IS THAT TYPICALLY IN THESE

06:04:03.621 --> 06:04:04.989
TYPES OF THINGS, SITUATIONS AT

06:04:05.056 --> 06:04:07.859
CITY LEVELS, NOT I'M SORRY, I

06:04:07.926 --> 06:04:09.360
MADE A POINT TO THE OTHER

06:04:09.427 --> 06:04:10.228
AMENDMENT, WHICH WE TOOK WITH

06:04:10.295 --> 06:04:11.563
THE SUGGESTION OF LAW

06:04:11.629 --> 06:04:16.034
ENFORCEMENT, WHICH IS ON BE TWO,

06:04:16.100 --> 06:04:17.936
WHICH SAYS, EXCEPT FOR THE FINAL

06:04:18.002 --> 06:04:19.237
REPORT, A DRAFT OF ANY REPORT

06:04:19.304 --> 06:04:20.772
CREATED BY THE USE OF I SHALL

06:04:20.838 --> 06:04:22.040
NOT CONSTITUTE AN OFFICER'S

06:04:22.106 --> 06:04:23.942
OFFICIAL STATEMENT. AND THE

06:04:24.008 --> 06:04:25.577
INTENT OF THAT IS TO MAKE SURE

06:04:25.643 --> 06:04:27.312
THERE'S NO LIABILITY TO THE

06:04:27.378 --> 06:04:28.279
OFFICER BASED ON WHAT THE DRAFT

06:04:28.346 --> 06:04:30.615
SAYS. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT TO

06:04:30.682 --> 06:04:31.916
THE OFFICER, TO THE OFFICER THAT

06:04:31.983 --> 06:04:33.151
THAT ALLEVIATES THE OFFICER, BUT

06:04:33.218 --> 06:04:35.153
NOT TO THE CITY. SO WHAT I'M

06:04:35.220 --> 06:04:36.921
SAYING IS DRAFT VERSIONS OF

06:04:36.988 --> 06:04:41.292
THINGS USUALLY ARE. SO LET'S NOT

06:04:41.359 --> 06:04:43.895
SAY I LET'S JUST SAY TWO

06:04:43.962 --> 06:04:45.697
OFFICERS WORKED ON A REPORT, BUT

06:04:45.763 --> 06:04:47.332
IT'S ONE PERSON'S REPORT.

06:04:47.398 --> 06:04:48.900
COULDN'T SAY, HEY, THE OTHER

06:04:48.967 --> 06:04:50.735
AUTHOR. THIS WAS THEIR DRAFT

06:04:50.802 --> 06:04:52.337
VERSION. THIS IS HOW MUCH THEY

06:04:52.403 --> 06:04:53.271
CONTRIBUTED, THE OTHER FOR THE

06:04:53.338 --> 06:04:55.440
OTHER OFFICER. AND SO TO SHOW

06:04:55.506 --> 06:04:56.608
THAT WHICH WOULD COULD

06:04:56.674 --> 06:04:57.842
POTENTIALLY SHOW LIABILITY IN

06:04:57.909 --> 06:04:59.077
COURT. SO I WAS JUST TALKING

06:04:59.143 --> 06:05:01.713
ABOUT JUST THIS WHOLE DRAFT

06:05:01.779 --> 06:05:03.314
VERSION AND THE LIABILITY THAT

06:05:03.381 --> 06:05:06.818
COULD CREATE. SO AND I THINK MR.

06:05:06.884 --> 06:05:08.553
FELDMAN, I THINK HE CAN HELP

06:05:08.620 --> 06:05:09.988
ANSWER. I KNOW WE WORK. WE'VE

06:05:10.054 --> 06:05:11.856
BEEN IN ACTIVE DISCUSSION ABOUT

06:05:11.923 --> 06:05:13.658
THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. YEAH. AND

06:05:13.725 --> 06:05:15.126
THAT THAT LINE IN THERE ABOUT IT

06:05:15.193 --> 06:05:16.861
NOT CONSTITUTING THE OFFICER'S

06:05:16.928 --> 06:05:17.962
OFFICIAL STATEMENT IS TO PREVENT

06:05:18.029 --> 06:05:19.030
THAT INFORMATION FROM COMING

06:05:19.097 --> 06:05:20.565
INTO A COURT SITUATION, BE USED

06:05:20.632 --> 06:05:22.667
AGAINST A DRAFT VERSION. AND

06:05:22.734 --> 06:05:24.235
IT'S ONLY IT'S JUST INTERNAL.

06:05:24.302 --> 06:05:25.837
IT'S NOT THE OFFICER'S OFFICIAL

06:05:25.903 --> 06:05:27.205
STATEMENT. AND OUR LEGAL COUNSEL

06:05:27.272 --> 06:05:30.208
IS ARGUED FOR THAT. SO THAT THAT

06:05:30.275 --> 06:05:32.143
DOESN'T END UP IN A COURT SYSTEM

06:05:32.210 --> 06:05:33.311
BEING USED AGAINST AN OFFICER,

06:05:33.378 --> 06:05:35.747
BECAUSE AGAIN, IT'S JUST A

06:05:35.813 --> 06:05:36.981
DRAFT, BUT IT USED AGAINST THE

06:05:37.048 --> 06:05:39.150
CITY OR A COUNTY. I'LL LEAVE.

06:05:39.217 --> 06:05:40.151
I'LL LEAVE IT BE. I CAN BRING

06:05:40.218 --> 06:05:42.120
THAT BACK AND MAKE SURE I'LL

06:05:42.186 --> 06:05:43.888
EVEN BE. I JUST THINK THE WHOLE

06:05:43.955 --> 06:05:45.089
WE USUALLY DON'T KEEP DRAFTS AS

06:05:45.156 --> 06:05:47.225
A PART OF ANY TYPE OF RECORD

06:05:47.292 --> 06:05:48.793
THAT IS ALLOWABLE TO BE USED OR

06:05:48.860 --> 06:05:49.961
PUBLIC REQUEST ACT OR ANYTHING

06:05:50.028 --> 06:05:51.596
LIKE THAT. SO I JUST WANTED TO

06:05:51.663 --> 06:05:53.064
MAKE SURE AND THE CRIMINAL

06:05:53.131 --> 06:05:54.132
SETTING, I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY

06:05:54.198 --> 06:05:56.868
AND I'LL TURN IT OVER TO THE PD

06:05:56.934 --> 06:05:58.069
TO EXPLAIN IT. IN A CRIMINAL

06:05:58.136 --> 06:05:59.304
SETTING, IT IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE

06:05:59.370 --> 06:06:00.905
THAT CAN BE EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE

06:06:00.972 --> 06:06:01.706
WITH THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS

06:06:01.773 --> 06:06:03.308
TO BY THE DEFENDANT. AND SO THEY

06:06:03.374 --> 06:06:04.342
ACTUALLY HAVE TO RETAIN THINGS

06:06:04.409 --> 06:06:06.511
IN A DIFFERENT WAY TO COMPLY

06:06:06.577 --> 06:06:07.345
WITH CONSTITUTION. I DON'T KNOW

06:06:07.412 --> 06:06:09.247
IF YOU WANT TO ADD IN. I'M AWARE

06:06:09.314 --> 06:06:11.516
I'M SO I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY

06:06:11.582 --> 06:06:12.884
CAN. YEAH. DESTROY DRAFTS

06:06:12.950 --> 06:06:14.819
ANYWAYS. YOU CAN YOU CAN ASK I

06:06:14.886 --> 06:06:16.354
WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET A

06:06:16.421 --> 06:06:18.556
CHANCE TO MAKE SURE. I JUST WANT

06:06:18.623 --> 06:06:19.957
TO FLAG IT YOUR, YOUR SUGGESTION

06:06:20.024 --> 06:06:22.827
WHICH IS THAT THAT PROVISION

06:06:22.894 --> 06:06:25.563
AROUND THE DRAFT REPORT NOT

06:06:25.630 --> 06:06:26.564
BASICALLY CREATING LIABILITY.

06:06:26.631 --> 06:06:27.999
THE OFFICER THAT THAT SHOULD

06:06:28.066 --> 06:06:30.001
ALSO BE EXTENDED TO THE CITY OR

06:06:30.068 --> 06:06:31.769
CITY OR COUNTY. YES. YEAH.

06:06:31.836 --> 06:06:33.671
THAT'S WHAT IT IS TO, TO ALL

06:06:33.738 --> 06:06:35.306
INVOLVED THAT IT IS A DRAFT JUST

06:06:35.373 --> 06:06:36.808
FOR INTERNAL PURPOSES AND

06:06:36.874 --> 06:06:38.242
COMPARISON. BUT THEN IF THE

06:06:38.309 --> 06:06:39.410
OFFICER, MAYBE I'LL PUT THE CITY

06:06:39.477 --> 06:06:41.145
WHO ALLOWED THE USE OF THE

06:06:41.212 --> 06:06:42.847
COUNTY WHO ALLOWED THE USE OF

06:06:42.914 --> 06:06:44.182
THE AI TOOL WOULD THEN NOW COULD

06:06:44.248 --> 06:06:46.818
BE LIABLE. AND I'M CERTAINLY

06:06:46.884 --> 06:06:47.418
HAPPY TO CONSIDER THAT. THANK

06:06:47.485 --> 06:06:49.320
YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT. OKAY.

06:06:49.387 --> 06:06:51.322
DID YOU WANT TO ADD IN TO THE

06:06:51.389 --> 06:06:54.625
POINT I WAS MAKING THAT A LOT OF

06:06:54.692 --> 06:06:55.960
WHAT YOU GET, THE INFORMATION.

06:06:56.027 --> 06:06:57.562
THE AI IS REALLY LIKE THE BODY

06:06:57.628 --> 06:06:59.197
CAMERA. RIGHT. AND SO THEY COME

06:06:59.263 --> 06:07:01.232
BACK INTO THEIR INTO MY

06:07:01.299 --> 06:07:02.633
UNDERSTANDING IS THEY COME BACK,

06:07:02.700 --> 06:07:04.635
BACK TO HEADQUARTERS AND THEY

06:07:04.702 --> 06:07:06.738
STICK IT INTO SOME MACHINE AND

06:07:06.804 --> 06:07:09.207
THE AI SPITS IT OUT. AND SO ALSO

06:07:09.273 --> 06:07:11.709
FOR DEFENSE PURPOSES, IT IS

06:07:11.776 --> 06:07:13.444
SOMETHING THAT WE MIGHT WANT TO

06:07:13.511 --> 06:07:15.613
SEE IN A CRIMINAL CASE. WHAT

06:07:15.680 --> 06:07:17.548
WHAT THE BODY CAM TRANSCRIPT

06:07:17.615 --> 06:07:20.318
MIGHT LOOK LIKE. AND WE MIGHT

06:07:20.385 --> 06:07:22.120
NEED TO COMPARE THAT TO THE

06:07:22.186 --> 06:07:24.355
FINAL DRAFT. BUT THE OFFICER'S

06:07:24.422 --> 06:07:26.357
OFFICIAL REPORT IS WHAT THEY

06:07:26.424 --> 06:07:27.859
SIGN. AND THEN IT'S VERY CLEAR

06:07:27.925 --> 06:07:30.194
THAT THE FIRST DRAFT IS ONLY

06:07:30.261 --> 06:07:32.296
WHAT I SAID. AND I GET, YOU

06:07:32.363 --> 06:07:34.432
KNOW, WE'VE HAD THIS WHOLE DAY,

06:07:34.499 --> 06:07:36.934
WE'VE HEARD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

06:07:37.001 --> 06:07:37.935
HOW ACCURATE OR INACCURATE I

06:07:38.002 --> 06:07:41.005
MIGHT BE. YEAH, BUT THERE IS A

06:07:41.072 --> 06:07:42.673
HUMAN REVIEW PROCESS IN THIS

06:07:42.740 --> 06:07:44.041
100%, AND YOU DEFINITELY DON'T

06:07:44.108 --> 06:07:46.010
WANT TO TALK ME OUT OF MY VOTE.

06:07:46.077 --> 06:07:48.546
OH, NO. WE SHOULD STOP, I GOT

06:07:48.613 --> 06:07:53.017
IT. ANYBODY ELSE? YEAH. I THINK

06:07:53.084 --> 06:07:55.353
YOUR POINT IS THE FINAL DRAFT IS

06:07:55.420 --> 06:07:56.988
THAT SHOULD BE THE FINAL DRAFT

06:07:57.054 --> 06:07:59.190
ON THE LIABILITY. EXACTLY I

06:07:59.257 --> 06:08:02.427
UNDERSTAND. YEAH. AND I THINK

06:08:02.493 --> 06:08:04.295
THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF LIKE,

06:08:04.362 --> 06:08:05.630
CAN WE ADDRESS THE CIVIL

06:08:05.696 --> 06:08:06.798
LIABILITY WHILE RETAINING THE

06:08:06.864 --> 06:08:07.999
RIGHTS OF THE CRIMINAL

06:08:08.065 --> 06:08:09.033
DEFENDANT, WHICH I THINK IS

06:08:09.100 --> 06:08:10.201
POSSIBLE. WE JUST NEED TO THREAD

06:08:10.268 --> 06:08:12.804
THAT NEEDLE. AND WE HAVE THE

06:08:12.870 --> 06:08:14.238
PUBLIC SAFETY CHAIR HERE. SO I

06:08:14.305 --> 06:08:16.374
BET HE COULD HELP THAT. ANYBODY

06:08:16.441 --> 06:08:19.477
ELSE? OKAY. WELL, I REALLY

06:08:19.544 --> 06:08:21.145
APPRECIATE THIS. I THINK THIS

06:08:21.212 --> 06:08:23.281
FOLLOWS IN LINE WITH SOME OF THE

06:08:23.347 --> 06:08:24.882
OTHER AI BILLS WE HAVE DONE

06:08:24.949 --> 06:08:26.484
WHERE WE'RE PUTTING A HUMAN IN

06:08:26.551 --> 06:08:28.252
THE LOOP. AND WE KNOW THAT AI TO

06:08:28.319 --> 06:08:30.154
THE POINT THAT WAS MADE BY YOUR

06:08:30.221 --> 06:08:31.956
SPONSORS, IT HALLUCINATES. I

06:08:32.023 --> 06:08:34.025
MEAN, YOU KNOW, WE DON'T FULLY

06:08:34.091 --> 06:08:35.193
UNDERSTAND ALL THE WAYS THAT AI

06:08:35.259 --> 06:08:37.462
SPITS OUT THE THINGS IT DOES.

06:08:37.528 --> 06:08:39.931
AND SO, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW

06:08:39.997 --> 06:08:41.466
WHETHER THESE ARE CHEN AI TOOLS

06:08:41.532 --> 06:08:43.267
OR WHAT KIND OF TOOLS THESE ARE

06:08:43.334 --> 06:08:44.936
THAT ARE BEING UTILIZED. BUT IT

06:08:45.002 --> 06:08:46.137
IS IMPORTANT WE, YOU KNOW, WE

06:08:46.204 --> 06:08:47.271
PASSED A BILL THAT IN THE

06:08:47.338 --> 06:08:48.906
MEDICAL SETTING, FOR EXAMPLE, ON

06:08:48.973 --> 06:08:50.575
THE NOTES THAT DOCTORS SPIT OUT,

06:08:50.641 --> 06:08:52.677
THEY HAVE TO DO THIS AS WELL,

06:08:52.743 --> 06:08:54.011
RIGHT? WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

06:08:54.078 --> 06:08:56.080
IT'S NOT CHANGING THE DOSAGE,

06:08:56.147 --> 06:08:56.714
FOR EXAMPLE, BECAUSE THAT COULD

06:08:56.781 --> 06:08:57.849
BE REALLY CATASTROPHIC. AND THE

06:08:57.915 --> 06:08:59.617
SAME IS TRUE HERE. THESE ARE

06:08:59.684 --> 06:09:01.052
DOCUMENTS THAT IMPACT PEOPLE'S

06:09:01.118 --> 06:09:02.453
LIBERTY. AND SO WE WANT THEM TO

06:09:02.520 --> 06:09:04.255
BE ACCURATE. AND I REALLY

06:09:04.322 --> 06:09:05.490
APPRECIATE LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR

06:09:05.556 --> 06:09:06.123
BEING AT THE TABLE FOR AGREEING.

06:09:06.190 --> 06:09:08.125
I MEAN, I KNOW FUNDAMENTALLY YOU

06:09:08.192 --> 06:09:09.093
WANT JUSTICE FOR EVERYONE AS

06:09:09.160 --> 06:09:11.529
WELL. AND THAT IS WHAT THIS I

06:09:11.596 --> 06:09:14.198
THINK IS TRYING TO ACHIEVE. I,

06:09:14.265 --> 06:09:15.233
YOU KNOW, I THINK I TAKE A

06:09:15.299 --> 06:09:17.034
DIFFERENT APPROACH ON THE

06:09:17.101 --> 06:09:18.436
DRAFTS. I DID ONE DEATH PENALTY

06:09:18.503 --> 06:09:20.938
CASE IN MY CAREER, AND MY CLIENT

06:09:21.005 --> 06:09:23.107
WAS LET OFF DEATH ROW BECAUSE OF

06:09:23.174 --> 06:09:24.442
DRAFTS AND DIFFERENT ITERATIONS

06:09:24.509 --> 06:09:25.643
OF A DOCUMENT. SO I THINK DRAFTS

06:09:25.710 --> 06:09:26.844
AND ITERATIONS ARE ACTUALLY

06:09:26.911 --> 06:09:28.012
REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY

06:09:28.079 --> 06:09:31.048
TELL A STORY. AND SOMETIMES THE

06:09:31.115 --> 06:09:32.183
CHANGES WILL BE BECAUSE IT'S

06:09:32.250 --> 06:09:34.585
MORE IN LINE WITH WHAT THE

06:09:34.652 --> 06:09:35.186
BODYCAM FOOTAGE IS. BUT IT'S

06:09:35.253 --> 06:09:36.420
IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE

06:09:36.487 --> 06:09:37.889
THOSE CHANGES AND HOW ARE THEY

06:09:37.955 --> 06:09:39.123
DOING. BUT I THINK THAT'S

06:09:39.190 --> 06:09:40.191
DIFFERENT BECAUSE THAT'S ABOUT

06:09:40.258 --> 06:09:41.726
DEFENDING THE CRIMINAL VERSUS

06:09:41.792 --> 06:09:42.894
LIABILITY. I THINK WE CAN THREAD

06:09:42.960 --> 06:09:44.562
THAT NEEDLE. AND SO, YOU KNOW, I

06:09:44.629 --> 06:09:46.430
REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE

06:09:46.497 --> 06:09:47.298
TRYING TO DO HERE AND HOW YOU'VE

06:09:47.365 --> 06:09:48.132
WORKED REALLY HARD WITH

06:09:48.199 --> 06:09:49.133
EVERYBODY TO GET THIS RIGHT. AND

06:09:49.200 --> 06:09:51.202
I KNOW THAT WE'RE NOT 100%

06:09:51.269 --> 06:09:52.336
THERE. BUT AGAIN, WE THANK YOU

06:09:52.403 --> 06:09:54.071
FOR WORKING SO MUCH WITH

06:09:54.138 --> 06:09:55.072
COMMITTEE, BECAUSE I KNOW THAT

06:09:55.139 --> 06:09:56.741
IN OUR EFFORTS TO MAKE SURE THAT

06:09:56.807 --> 06:09:59.043
WHAT WE WERE ASKING FOR WAS IN

06:09:59.110 --> 06:10:00.545
LINE WITH EVERYBODY, I COULD

06:10:00.611 --> 06:10:01.145
TELL THAT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT

06:10:01.212 --> 06:10:02.713
WAS ABSOLUTELY AT THE TABLE AND

06:10:02.780 --> 06:10:03.781
REALLY COOPERATING IN GETTING

06:10:03.848 --> 06:10:05.182
THIS RIGHT. SO THANK YOU FOR

06:10:05.249 --> 06:10:08.119
THAT HARD WORK AND FOR BEING SO

06:10:08.185 --> 06:10:09.854
OPEN AND WILLING TO WORK WITH

06:10:09.921 --> 06:10:11.022
EVERYONE, INCLUDING THE

06:10:11.088 --> 06:10:12.089
COMMITTEE. WITH THAT. WOULD YOU

06:10:12.156 --> 06:10:14.091
LIKE TO CLOSE? WELL, I WANT TO

06:10:14.158 --> 06:10:15.426
THANK MR. FELDMAN AND ALL THE

06:10:15.493 --> 06:10:16.127
LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUPS THAT

06:10:16.193 --> 06:10:18.162
WE'VE WORKED WITH ON THIS. I

06:10:18.229 --> 06:10:19.297
THINK, ASSEMBLYMAN WILSON, FOR

06:10:19.363 --> 06:10:20.798
YOUR SUGGESTION. WE'LL TAKE THAT

06:10:20.865 --> 06:10:23.401
BACK AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR

06:10:23.467 --> 06:10:25.536

SERVICE DATA THAT'S ALREADY BEEN

06:11:36.073 --> 06:11:37.174

MAKE SURE THAT DATA IS SHARED IN

HAPPENED WITH DATA LEAKS AND

06:11:52.556 --> 06:11:53.958
HERE. BUT IF WE DON'T HAVE A

BOARD MOVING FORWARD, THEN THOSE

06:11:55.760 --> 06:11:56.761
POTENTIAL LEAKS COULD HAPPEN

BECAUSE THE BOARD THEMSELVES

MAKE SURE THAT A PROVIDER

06:12:04.201 --> 06:12:05.002
ENTITY, WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING TO

06:12:43.607 --> 06:12:45.042
ADVOCATES, COMMUNITY BASED

06:12:45.109 --> 06:12:46.510
ORGANIZATIONS, PROVIDERS, PLANS

06:12:46.577 --> 06:12:48.546

06:12:48.612 --> 06:12:50.247
EVERY CALIFORNIAN AND THEIR CARE

06:12:50.314 --> 06:12:52.183

06:12:52.249 --> 06:12:53.617
INSIGHTS THEY NEED TO MAKE CARE

06:12:53.684 --> 06:12:55.419
SEAMLESS, HIGH QUALITY, AND

06:12:55.486 --> 06:12:57.188
AFFORDABLE. WITH THE

06:12:57.254 --> 06:12:58.389
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE DCSF AND

06:12:58.456 --> 06:13:00.124
ITS UNIFORM DATA SHARING

06:13:00.191 --> 06:13:02.159
AGREEMENT, OVER 4000 HEALTHCARE

06:13:02.226 --> 06:13:03.294
AND SOCIAL SERVICES

06:13:03.360 --> 06:13:04.528
ORGANIZATIONS HAVE NOW SIGNED

06:13:04.595 --> 06:13:06.630
ON, AGREEING TO SAFELY AND

06:13:06.697 --> 06:13:08.365
SECURELY SHARE DATA UNDER THE

06:13:08.432 --> 06:13:10.601
SAME RULES OF THE ROAD. THE

AGREEMENT ALIGNS WITH ALL

06:13:12.136 --> 06:13:13.504
APPLICABLE STATE AND FEDERAL

06:13:13.571 --> 06:13:15.239
LAWS AND INCLUDES POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES COVERING PRIVACY AND

06:13:17.174 --> 06:13:19.143
SECURITY SAFEGUARDS, BREACH

06:13:19.210 --> 06:13:20.611
NOTIFICATION AND INDIVIDUAL'S

06:13:20.678 --> 06:13:22.913
ACCESS TO THEIR OWN RECORDS. YET

06:13:22.980 --> 06:13:24.381
THERE REMAINS A CRITICAL GAP. WE

06:13:24.448 --> 06:13:25.816
CURRENTLY HAVE NO FORMAL

06:13:25.883 --> 06:13:27.184
GOVERNANCE BODY, NOR THE ABILITY

06:13:27.251 --> 06:13:29.019
TO KNOW WHO'S COMPLYING WITH

06:13:29.086 --> 06:13:30.488
THIS LACK OF VISIBILITY. IT'S

06:13:30.554 --> 06:13:32.590
NOT POSSIBLE TO EFFECTIVELY

06:13:32.656 --> 06:13:33.891
SUPPORT A COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM

06:13:33.958 --> 06:13:36.227
OF CARE, NOR ITS SAFETY AND

06:13:36.293 --> 06:13:38.295
PRIVACY. WITHOUT CLEAR

06:13:38.362 --> 06:13:39.396
ACCOUNTABILITY, WE RISK

06:13:39.463 --> 06:13:40.965
UNDERMINING CONFIDENCE AND TRUST

06:13:41.031 --> 06:13:43.768
IN THIS EFFORT. SB 660 CLOSES

06:13:43.834 --> 06:13:45.102
THIS GAP BY CREATING THE

06:13:45.169 --> 06:13:46.337
MECHANISMS NEEDED TO ENSURE

06:13:46.403 --> 06:13:48.339
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICE

06:13:48.405 --> 06:13:50.107
ORGANIZATIONS ARE ALL UPHOLDING

06:13:50.174 --> 06:13:52.777
THE OBLIGATIONS OUTLINED IN THE

06:13:52.843 --> 06:13:54.044
DCSF. BY ESTABLISHING GOVERNANCE

06:13:54.111 --> 06:13:55.146
AND ACCOUNTABILITY, WE CAN

06:13:55.212 --> 06:13:56.981
FULFILL THE PROMISE OF THE DCSF

06:13:57.047 --> 06:13:58.983
THAT WAS STARTED FOUR YEARS AGO,

ACHIEVING A SAFER AND MORE

06:14:00.317 --> 06:14:02.086
CONNECTED SYSTEM OF CARE ACROSS

06:14:02.153 --> 06:14:05.322
CALIFORNIA. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK

06:14:05.389 --> 06:14:06.257

06:14:31.649 --> 06:14:34.218
EXCHANGE AGREEMENT AND BEGINNING

06:14:34.285 --> 06:14:35.619
IMPLEMENTATION, INCLUDING

06:14:35.686 --> 06:14:37.521
SECURING A DCSF GRANT TO CONNECT

06:14:37.588 --> 06:14:38.823
TO A QUALIFIED HEALTH

06:14:38.889 --> 06:14:41.025
INFORMATION ORGANIZATION. WE

06:14:41.091 --> 06:14:42.593
KNOW THAT A ROBUST, APPROPRIATE

06:14:42.660 --> 06:14:44.562
AND SECURE DATA SHARING ISN'T

06:14:44.628 --> 06:14:46.697
JUST A TECHNICAL GOAL. IT'S

06:14:46.764 --> 06:14:47.865
FUNDAMENTAL TO DELIVERING HIGH

06:14:47.932 --> 06:14:49.533
QUALITY, TIMELY AND EQUITABLE

06:14:49.600 --> 06:14:51.302

THEIR INFORMATION IS USED FOR

06:14:55.172 --> 06:14:57.041
THE RIGHT PURPOSES. HOWEVER,

06:14:57.107 --> 06:14:58.976
WHEN CALIFORNIA FIRST

06:14:59.043 --> 06:15:00.511
ESTABLISHED THE DATA EXCHANGE

06:15:00.578 --> 06:15:02.613
FRAMEWORK FOUR YEARS AGO, MANY

06:15:02.680 --> 06:15:03.647
COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS

06:15:03.714 --> 06:15:05.082
WONDERED IF THEY WERE TRULY

06:15:05.149 --> 06:15:06.517
INCLUDED. THE BROAD LABEL OF

06:15:06.584 --> 06:15:08.085
PROVIDER ORGANIZATIONS AND

06:15:08.152 --> 06:15:10.120
MEDICAL GROUPS DIDN'T CLEARLY

06:15:10.187 --> 06:15:11.989
REFLECT THE UNIQUE ROLE THAT

06:15:12.056 --> 06:15:14.425
COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS PROVIDE

06:15:14.491 --> 06:15:16.560
ACROSS OUR STATE. HEALTH CENTER

06:15:16.627 --> 06:15:18.429
TEAMS ARE NOW READY TO DO THEIR

06:15:18.495 --> 06:15:19.530

06:15:19.597 --> 06:15:20.931
THAT OTHERS HOSPITALS, HEALTH

06:15:20.998 --> 06:15:22.266

06:15:22.333 --> 06:15:24.201
COMMITTED TO DOING THEIRS

06:15:24.268 --> 06:15:25.636
WITHOUT GOVERNANCE OR

06:15:25.703 --> 06:15:27.304
ACCOUNTABILITY. IT'S BEEN

06:15:27.371 --> 06:15:28.806
CHALLENGING FOR INDIVIDUAL

06:15:28.873 --> 06:15:30.708
ORGANIZATIONS TO MAKE PROGRESS

06:15:30.774 --> 06:15:31.742

06:15:33.611 --> 06:15:35.079

06:15:36.780 --> 06:15:38.782
TO PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS.

06:15:38.849 --> 06:15:39.950
STRENGTHENING COMPLIANCE WITH

06:15:40.017 --> 06:15:42.853

06:18:00.791 --> 06:18:03.427
COUPLE OF PRIMARY ISSUES. I DO

WANT TO MENTION THAT HOSPITALS

EXTREMELY TECHNICAL AND COMPLEX

06:18:11.668 --> 06:18:13.670

EXCHANGE BOARD, AND ALSO

06:18:41.832 --> 06:18:43.133
REMOVING POTENTIALLY PUNITIVE

THIS EARLY STAGE IMPLEMENTATION.

06:18:47.337 --> 06:18:48.272
WHILE THE DATA EXCHANGE

06:18:48.338 --> 06:18:49.406
FRAMEWORK HAS THE POTENTIAL TO

06:18:49.473 --> 06:18:51.141
IMPROVE CARE COORDINATION, IT

06:18:51.208 --> 06:18:52.576
ALSO INTRODUCES NEW

06:18:52.643 --> 06:18:53.877
CYBERSECURITY RISKS AS THOUSANDS

06:18:53.944 --> 06:18:55.813
OF PROVIDERS AND THIRD PARTY

06:19:21.772 --> 06:19:22.606
DELGADO, ON BEHALF OF POINT

06:19:22.673 --> 06:19:24.074
CLICK CARE, WE DO HAVE AN

06:19:24.141 --> 06:19:26.443
OPPOSING, LESS AMENDED POSITION.

06:19:26.510 --> 06:19:28.545
REALLY DEALING WITH THE IMPACT

06:19:28.612 --> 06:19:29.847
TO SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES.

06:19:29.913 --> 06:19:32.149
OUR PARTNERS AND WE'VE HAD

06:19:32.216 --> 06:19:33.317
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR,

06:19:33.383 --> 06:19:34.351
STAFF AND SPONSOR. WE HOPE TO

06:19:34.418 --> 06:19:37.287
RESOLVE THOSE ISSUES. THANK YOU.

06:19:37.354 --> 06:19:38.388
SEEING NOBODY ELSE, WE'LL BRING

06:19:38.455 --> 06:19:41.825
IT BACK TO THE DÍAS. THANK YOU,

06:19:41.892 --> 06:19:48.098
MADAM VICE CHAIR. YOUR MIC. THIS

06:19:48.165 --> 06:19:50.067
IS AS SIMPLE AS YOU'RE

06:19:50.134 --> 06:19:51.001
DESCRIBING OR IT'S BEEN

06:19:51.068 --> 06:19:52.336
DESCRIBED AS JUST TRANSFERRING

06:19:52.402 --> 06:19:54.872
EXISTING DATA INTO A DIFFERENT

06:19:54.938 --> 06:19:56.974
REPOSITORY. NO, NO. SO A COUPLE

06:19:57.040 --> 06:19:59.076
OF YEARS AGO WE'VE ESTABLISHED

06:19:59.143 --> 06:20:00.444
THE DATA EXCHANGE FRAMEWORK WITH

06:20:00.511 --> 06:20:03.814
THE DH. AS IT'S BEEN NOTED HERE.

06:20:03.881 --> 06:20:07.417
SO AS OF A YEAR AGO OR EVEN

06:20:07.484 --> 06:20:09.186
JANUARY OF THIS YEAR, CERTAIN

06:20:09.253 --> 06:20:11.388
INDIVIDUALS HAVE ALREADY STARTED

06:20:11.455 --> 06:20:13.123
TO SHARE THAT DATA. BY LAW, THEY

06:20:13.190 --> 06:20:14.958
NEED TO SHARE DATA AMONGST EACH

06:20:15.025 --> 06:20:16.493
OTHER. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU GO TO

06:20:16.560 --> 06:20:18.462
YOUR COUNTY OF CARE, BUT THEN

06:20:18.529 --> 06:20:19.596
YOU'RE ON VACATION SOMEWHERE

06:20:19.663 --> 06:20:21.131
ELSE IN A DIFFERENT COUNTY, SO

06:20:21.198 --> 06:20:21.965
THAT DATA, YOUR HEALTH

06:20:22.032 --> 06:20:22.966
INSURANCE, YOUR HEALTH

06:20:23.033 --> 06:20:24.568
INFORMATION CAN BE SHARED

06:20:24.635 --> 06:20:25.636
AMONGST DIFFERENT ENTITIES. SO

06:20:25.702 --> 06:20:26.937
THAT'S OUR REQUIREMENT. NOW,

06:20:27.004 --> 06:20:28.872
WHAT DOESN'T EXIST IS A BOARD

06:20:28.939 --> 06:20:30.374
THAT CAN GOVERN POLICIES AND

06:20:30.440 --> 06:20:32.009
SAY, THIS IS HOW IT SHOULD BE

06:20:32.075 --> 06:20:34.111
DONE. SO MY BILL DOES NOT

06:20:34.178 --> 06:20:37.014
ESTABLISH A NEW MANDATE TO SHARE

06:20:37.080 --> 06:20:38.916
DATA THAT'S ALREADY IN STATUTE.

06:20:38.982 --> 06:20:40.684
MY BILL ESTABLISHES, SHOULD IT

06:20:40.751 --> 06:20:43.220
PASS A BOARD TO GOVERN HOW THAT

06:20:43.287 --> 06:20:45.722
DATA SHOULD BE SHARED. OKAY.

06:20:45.789 --> 06:20:47.090
WELL THEN I HAVE ANOTHER

06:20:47.157 --> 06:20:51.061
QUESTION. NOW, WE I KNOW MANY OF

06:20:51.128 --> 06:20:53.564
US, BUT WHERE I VISIT DIFFERENT

06:20:53.630 --> 06:20:56.733
DOCTORS IN MY AREA, THERE'S MY

06:20:56.800 --> 06:20:58.602
CHART. IS THIS THE SAME AS HOW

06:20:58.669 --> 06:21:01.138
MEDICAL INFORMATION FOR

06:21:01.205 --> 06:21:02.940
PARTICIPATING DOCTORS. AND I'VE

06:21:03.006 --> 06:21:05.442
UNDERSTOOD THERE'S THERE THEY

06:21:05.509 --> 06:21:07.244
OPERATE UP HERE AND THEY'RE

06:21:07.311 --> 06:21:08.879
WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON

06:21:08.946 --> 06:21:09.713
VARIOUS PIECES OF LEGISLATION.

06:21:09.780 --> 06:21:10.647
WHEN I DISCOVERED THAT, OH, I

06:21:10.714 --> 06:21:12.549
KNOW WHAT MY CHART IS. IS THIS A

06:21:12.616 --> 06:21:14.518
SIMILAR WHERE INDIVIDUALS AND

06:21:14.585 --> 06:21:16.286
THEIR DOCTORS ARE SHARING? WE

06:21:16.353 --> 06:21:17.688
HAVE TO ACCESS IT THROUGH

06:21:17.754 --> 06:21:18.522
PASSWORDS AND EVERYTHING ELSE,

06:21:18.589 --> 06:21:20.991
OUR OWN MEDICAL INFORMATION. BUT

06:21:21.058 --> 06:21:22.693
MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS AND

06:21:22.759 --> 06:21:25.162
DOCTORS, PHYSICIANS WHO

06:21:25.229 --> 06:21:26.697
PARTICIPATE ARE SHARING ALL THIS

06:21:26.763 --> 06:21:27.431
INFORMATION. IS THAT CORRECT?

06:21:27.497 --> 06:21:29.433
THAT IS CORRECT. SO HOW DO WE

06:21:29.499 --> 06:21:30.234
THEN GOVERN THAT AND MAKE SURE

06:21:30.300 --> 06:21:31.935
THAT THERE ARE PROTECTIONS IN

06:21:32.002 --> 06:21:33.837
PLACE NOW? RIGHT. IT'S SOME ARE

06:21:33.904 --> 06:21:35.339
OPERATING RIGHT NOW. YES. NOT

06:21:35.405 --> 06:21:38.175
EVERYONE HAS STARTED THE DATA

06:21:38.242 --> 06:21:41.912
SHARING OKAY. SO YOU'RE GOING TO

06:21:41.979 --> 06:21:44.314
HAVE A BOARD IS AS POLITICIZED.

06:21:44.381 --> 06:21:47.184
IS THIS ARE THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE

06:21:47.251 --> 06:21:48.752
PROFESSIONALS IN THE MEDICAL

06:21:48.819 --> 06:21:50.187
INDUSTRY. SO BEFORE WHEN IT CAME

06:21:50.254 --> 06:21:51.488
TO THIS COMMITTEE, WAS A BOARD

06:21:51.555 --> 06:21:53.523
MADE UP OF FIVE VOTING MEMBERS

06:21:53.590 --> 06:21:55.392
AND NINE NON-VOTING MEMBERS.

06:21:55.459 --> 06:21:56.526
WITH THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS,

06:21:56.593 --> 06:21:58.395
WE HAVE NOW INCREASED THAT TO

06:21:58.462 --> 06:22:00.631
SEVEN VOTING MEMBERS APPOINTED

06:22:00.697 --> 06:22:03.100
BY THE GOVERNOR, THE ASSEMBLY

06:22:03.166 --> 06:22:05.969
AND THE SENATE. WE I DO HAVE

06:22:06.036 --> 06:22:07.704
THREE SPECIFIC NOW FOR SPECIFIC

06:22:07.771 --> 06:22:09.206
PARAMETERS AROUND WHO MAKES UP

06:22:09.273 --> 06:22:11.041
THAT BOARD. ONE HAS TO BE A

06:22:11.108 --> 06:22:14.044
CONSUMER ADVOCATE. ONE HAS TO BE

06:22:14.111 --> 06:22:17.247
BY THE SECRETARY OF OUR CAO OR

06:22:17.314 --> 06:22:19.750
AN APPOINTMENT. ONE HAS TO BE A

06:22:19.816 --> 06:22:21.451
SIGNATORY, AND NOW ONE HAS TO BE

06:22:21.518 --> 06:22:24.254
AN EXPERT IN PRIVATE, IN

06:22:24.321 --> 06:22:26.857
PRIVACY. OKAY. SO IF YOU WOULD

06:22:26.923 --> 06:22:28.625
PLEASE GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF THE

06:22:28.692 --> 06:22:29.993
INFORMATION THAT THE ROLE THAT

06:22:30.060 --> 06:22:32.229
THIS BOARD WOULD PLAY IN MAKING

06:22:32.296 --> 06:22:33.697
DECISIONS, POLICY DECISIONS ON

06:22:33.764 --> 06:22:35.866
HOW INFORMATION IS SHARED, WHAT

06:22:35.932 --> 06:22:37.901
IS THE PROBLEM. ABSOLUTELY. SO

06:22:37.968 --> 06:22:41.204
ONE OF THE THINGS IS SO AS OF

06:22:41.271 --> 06:22:43.273
JANUARY OF THIS YEAR, THE

06:22:43.340 --> 06:22:45.142
SMALLER ENTITIES SHOULD HAVE

06:22:45.208 --> 06:22:46.677
ALREADY STARTED SHARING DATA.

06:22:46.743 --> 06:22:48.345
SOME HAVE NOT. SO PART OF THE

06:22:48.412 --> 06:22:49.946
BOARD WILL ALSO BE FOR

06:22:50.013 --> 06:22:52.716
ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM TO ENSURE

06:22:52.783 --> 06:22:55.252
THAT PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY

06:22:55.319 --> 06:22:55.919
PARTICIPATING, BECAUSE THEY HAVE

06:22:55.986 --> 06:22:59.256
TO BE PARTICIPATING IN EVERY

06:22:59.323 --> 06:23:00.957
CALIFORNIAN MUST PARTICIPATE

06:23:01.024 --> 06:23:03.226
HEALTH IN THE HEALTH SYSTEM?

06:23:03.293 --> 06:23:04.995
YES. EVERY PATIENT, NOT THE

06:23:05.062 --> 06:23:07.064
PATIENT. THIS IS ON THE PROVIDER.

06:23:07.130 --> 06:23:10.801
OH. OH YES THE WORKER. YES. YES.

06:23:10.867 --> 06:23:12.669
OH OH OKAY. YES. NOT INDIVIDUAL

06:23:12.736 --> 06:23:15.105
PERSONAL HEALTH INSURANCE. YES.

06:23:15.172 --> 06:23:16.106
SORRY. NOT HEALTH INSURANCE.

06:23:16.173 --> 06:23:17.908
HEALTH INFORMATION. YES. THAT IS

06:23:17.974 --> 06:23:19.476
CORRECT SPECIFICALLY TO A

06:23:19.543 --> 06:23:21.945
PERSON. SO FOR EXAMPLE, LET ME

06:23:22.012 --> 06:23:23.180
AND I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT DOING A

06:23:23.246 --> 06:23:25.449
GOOD JOB EXPLAINING THIS. SO SAY

06:23:25.515 --> 06:23:28.185
I THERE IS A CONCERN, THERE HAS

06:23:28.251 --> 06:23:29.786
BEEN A CONCERN IN CALIFORNIA

06:23:29.853 --> 06:23:30.987
THAT WHAT HAPPENS RIGHT NOW IS

06:23:31.054 --> 06:23:33.023
THAT WE GO SEE ONE ENTITY, AND

06:23:33.090 --> 06:23:34.658
THEN IF WE SEE SOMEONE ELSE,

06:23:34.725 --> 06:23:36.326
THAT ENTITY DOES NOT HAVE YOUR

06:23:36.393 --> 06:23:38.195
UP TO DATE INFORMATION. THAT'S

06:23:38.261 --> 06:23:39.863
WHAT MY CHART DOES. YES. SO

06:23:39.930 --> 06:23:42.499
LET'S ALSO TALK ABOUT UNHOUSED

06:23:42.566 --> 06:23:43.533
POPULATION WHERE YOU GO

06:23:43.600 --> 06:23:45.135
SOMEWHERE BECAUSE THEY MOVE

06:23:45.202 --> 06:23:48.171
AROUND, THEY GIVE THEM XYZ

06:23:48.238 --> 06:23:49.773
MEDICATION. AND IF THEY GO TO

06:23:49.840 --> 06:23:51.108
ANOTHER ENTITY, THAT PROVIDER

06:23:51.174 --> 06:23:52.876
HAS NO IDEA WHAT MEDICATION HAS

06:23:52.943 --> 06:23:54.711
BEEN GIVEN TO THE INDIVIDUAL.

06:23:54.778 --> 06:23:57.214
WITH THIS DATA EXCHANGE

06:23:57.280 --> 06:23:59.015
PLATFORM, THEY'LL BE ABLE TO

06:23:59.082 --> 06:24:00.283
UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING.

06:24:00.350 --> 06:24:01.418
WHAT IS CURRENTLY HAPPENING

06:24:01.485 --> 06:24:02.586
WITHOUT THIS DATA EXCHANGE IS

06:24:02.652 --> 06:24:04.855
THAT A PROVIDER IS LITERALLY ON

06:24:04.921 --> 06:24:07.624
THE PHONE WITH ANOTHER PROVIDER

06:24:07.691 --> 06:24:09.025
WAITING, HEY, I'M CALLING TO GET

06:24:09.092 --> 06:24:10.494
INFORMATION ON THIS PATIENT THAT

06:24:10.560 --> 06:24:13.063
COULD TAKE HOURS, MINUTES OR

06:24:13.130 --> 06:24:14.865
DAYS TO GET THAT INFORMATION AND

06:24:14.931 --> 06:24:17.000
THAT COULD HURT THE TREATMENT

06:24:17.067 --> 06:24:18.468
FOR THAT PATIENT THAT IS IN

06:24:18.535 --> 06:24:19.469
FRONT OF THEM, BECAUSE THEY

06:24:19.536 --> 06:24:21.338
DON'T HAVE THAT DATA ON THE

06:24:21.405 --> 06:24:22.672
COMPUTER SCREEN. NOW, THERE IS

06:24:22.739 --> 06:24:24.441
CONCERNS ABOUT PRIVACY AND SO

06:24:24.508 --> 06:24:26.309
FORTH. OBVIOUSLY THAT'S TRUE,

06:24:26.376 --> 06:24:28.111
BUT THERE IS NO GOVERNING BOARD

06:24:28.178 --> 06:24:29.980
TO SET IN PLACE POLICIES AND

06:24:30.046 --> 06:24:31.381
PROCEDURES ON HOW TO BEST

06:24:31.448 --> 06:24:32.516
PROTECT THAT DATA AND

06:24:32.582 --> 06:24:34.251
INFORMATION WILL COME IF THIS

06:24:34.317 --> 06:24:36.686
BOARD IS PUT IN PLACE. YES,

06:24:36.753 --> 06:24:38.655
OKAY. NOT BY LEGISLATION BUT BY

06:24:38.722 --> 06:24:40.090
THIS BOARD WILL ESTABLISH THE

06:24:40.157 --> 06:24:42.192
POLICY PARAMETERS FOR THE THAT

06:24:42.259 --> 06:24:44.261
IS CORRECT INFORMATION. YES. SO

06:24:44.327 --> 06:24:46.463
GIVING A LOT OF POWER TO THIS

06:24:46.530 --> 06:24:48.698
BOARD IN TERMS OF ACCESS TO

06:24:48.765 --> 06:24:49.833
PERSONAL INFORMATION, THERE

06:24:49.900 --> 06:24:51.835
EXISTS AN ADVISORY COUNCIL RIGHT

06:24:51.902 --> 06:24:53.370
NOW. AND THAT ADVISORY COUNCIL

06:24:53.437 --> 06:24:55.038
IS PROVIDING RECOMMENDATIONS

06:24:55.105 --> 06:24:56.973
RIGHT NOW, BUT DOES NOT HAVE THE

06:24:57.040 --> 06:25:00.210
AUTHORITY TO GOVERN OR PROVIDE

06:25:00.277 --> 06:25:03.146
ACTUAL POLICIES OUTSIDE OF JUST

06:25:03.213 --> 06:25:04.147
RECOMMENDATIONS. SO WE'RE LIVING

06:25:04.214 --> 06:25:05.782
IN A WORLD RIGHT NOW, SAY, THE

06:25:05.849 --> 06:25:07.417
LEAKS THAT HAPPEN WITH COVERED

06:25:07.484 --> 06:25:08.685
CALIFORNIA WE'RE LIVING. THAT

06:25:08.752 --> 06:25:10.554
COULD POTENTIALLY HAPPEN NOW

06:25:10.620 --> 06:25:12.122
WITH THIS INFORMATION, BUT

06:25:12.189 --> 06:25:14.324
THERE'S NO GOVERNING BOARD TO

06:25:14.391 --> 06:25:15.625
PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING. SO

06:25:15.692 --> 06:25:17.060
SHOULD THIS GOVERNING BOARD NOT

06:25:17.127 --> 06:25:18.161
MOVE FORWARD? WE'RE GOING TO

06:25:18.228 --> 06:25:20.130
STILL BE IN A PLACE WHERE

06:25:20.197 --> 06:25:21.498
ENTITIES ARE SHARING

06:25:21.565 --> 06:25:22.232
INFORMATION, AND THEY'RE SHARING

06:25:22.299 --> 06:25:23.867
IT WITHOUT HAVING IT BOARD TO

06:25:23.934 --> 06:25:25.168
TELL THEM EXACTLY HOW TO DO IT

06:25:25.235 --> 06:25:27.370
IN THE BEST MANNER POSSIBLE.

06:25:27.437 --> 06:25:28.538
THAT'S INTERESTING. OKAY. THANK

06:25:28.605 --> 06:25:30.040
YOU. APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU.

06:25:30.106 --> 06:25:31.942
AND I'LL NOTE ONE ADDITION TO

06:25:32.008 --> 06:25:35.512
WHAT THE AUTHOR SAID IS AS THE

06:25:35.579 --> 06:25:37.180
DATA EXCHANGE IS HAPPENING IN

06:25:37.247 --> 06:25:39.149
DIFFERENT SYSTEMS ARE NOW

06:25:39.216 --> 06:25:40.217
COMMUNICATING, WHICH IS REALLY

06:25:40.283 --> 06:25:41.485
THE GOAL PREVIOUSLY, RIGHT. IF

06:25:41.551 --> 06:25:43.220
YOU WERE ALWAYS AT KAISER, YOUR

06:25:43.286 --> 06:25:44.154
KAISER DOCTORS COULD KNOW, FOR

06:25:44.221 --> 06:25:45.822
EXAMPLE. BUT IF YOU WENT FROM

06:25:45.889 --> 06:25:46.957
KAISER TO SUTTER, THEN THEY

06:25:47.023 --> 06:25:48.358
WOULDN'T KNOW. THIS NOW ALLOWS

06:25:48.425 --> 06:25:50.861
FOR YOU TO BE MORE MOBILE IN

06:25:50.927 --> 06:25:52.329
CHOOSING DOCTORS AND HAVE THEM

06:25:52.395 --> 06:25:54.598
KNOW YOUR CARE. BUT ALL OF THAT

06:25:54.664 --> 06:25:56.399
DATA, REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS

06:25:56.466 --> 06:25:58.201
HERE, IS PROTECTED UNDER HIPAA

06:25:58.268 --> 06:26:00.337
AND CMIA, WHICH I THINK WAS AN

06:26:00.403 --> 06:26:01.037
IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL NOTE AROUND

06:26:01.104 --> 06:26:02.372
THE PRIVACY THAT DOES NOT

06:26:02.439 --> 06:26:03.907
CHANGE. ALL THE PROVIDERS IN THE

06:26:03.974 --> 06:26:05.509
DATA EXCHANGE ARE CONTINUING TO

06:26:05.575 --> 06:26:06.343
MAINTAIN THAT INCREDIBLY HIGH

06:26:06.409 --> 06:26:08.111
LEVEL OF PRIVACY FOR THIS DATA.

06:26:08.178 --> 06:26:10.347
SO I WANTED TO ADD THAT IN. SO

06:26:10.413 --> 06:26:13.517
PATTERSON. GREAT. THANKS. AND I

06:26:13.583 --> 06:26:15.085
APOLOGIZE. LIKE EVERYBODY, I'M

06:26:15.151 --> 06:26:16.786
IN BETWEEN TWO COMMITTEES RIGHT

06:26:16.853 --> 06:26:21.791
NOW. SO WANTED TO ASK THE

06:26:21.858 --> 06:26:24.594
OPPOSITION OR THE HOSPITALS

06:26:24.661 --> 06:26:27.797
PARTICULAR. YOUR CONCERN IS THE

06:26:27.864 --> 06:26:29.699
ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM OR WHAT

06:26:29.766 --> 06:26:31.568
WAS I WALKED IN LIKE MID WHAT

06:26:31.635 --> 06:26:33.270
YOU WERE SAYING. YEAH I THINK

06:26:33.336 --> 06:26:35.605
THANK YOU. SO OUR OUR CONCERNS

06:26:35.672 --> 06:26:37.908
ARE RELATED TO TWO ISSUES. ONE

06:26:37.974 --> 06:26:39.743
IS THE BOARD MAKEUP WHICH WE

06:26:39.809 --> 06:26:40.911
ACKNOWLEDGE AMENDMENTS ARE

06:26:40.977 --> 06:26:42.779
IMPROVING THAT. BUT THE

06:26:42.846 --> 06:26:44.781
EVOLUTION OF THIS BILL HAS AT

06:26:44.848 --> 06:26:46.883
THE AN EARLIER VERSION WOULD

06:26:46.950 --> 06:26:48.752
HAVE EXCLUDED ANY PROVIDER

06:26:48.818 --> 06:26:50.554
THAT'S A SIGNATORY FROM HAVING

06:26:50.620 --> 06:26:52.088
SOMEONE ON THE BOARD. MANY OF

06:26:52.155 --> 06:26:54.157
THE RENOWNED NATIONAL EXPERTS

06:26:54.224 --> 06:26:56.026
ALSO WORK FOR HEALTH CARE

06:26:56.092 --> 06:26:57.193
PROVIDERS. THAT'S BEEN CHANGED

06:26:57.260 --> 06:26:58.695
RECENTLY IN THE BILL. WE

06:26:58.762 --> 06:27:00.096
APPRECIATE THAT AT LEAST ONE

06:27:00.163 --> 06:27:03.199
BOARD SEAT, WE HAVE EVOLVED FROM

06:27:03.266 --> 06:27:04.901
OUR ORIGINAL POSITION TO ASK

06:27:04.968 --> 06:27:06.403
THAT POTENTIALLY AT LEAST TWO

06:27:06.469 --> 06:27:08.905
BOARD SEATS WOULD ALLOW THOSE

06:27:08.972 --> 06:27:11.141
THAT WORK FOR SIGNATORIES TO THE

06:27:11.207 --> 06:27:13.209
DATA EXCHANGE FRAMEWORK TO SERVE

06:27:13.276 --> 06:27:14.411
ON THE BOARD. AND THEN THE

06:27:14.477 --> 06:27:16.446
SECOND ISSUE RELATED TO THE

06:27:16.513 --> 06:27:18.381
POTENTIAL PENALTIES. IT ALLOWS

06:27:18.448 --> 06:27:20.817
THE BOARD TO ESTABLISH

06:27:20.884 --> 06:27:22.218
COMPLIANCE MECHANISMS, WHICH WE

06:27:22.285 --> 06:27:24.521
HAVE NOT OBJECTED TO. THERE'S A

06:27:24.588 --> 06:27:25.589
PROVISION IN THE BILL THAT IF

06:27:25.655 --> 06:27:28.158
YOU HAVE NOT YET SIGNED ON TO

06:27:28.224 --> 06:27:28.758
THE DATA EXCHANGE FRAMEWORK,

06:27:28.825 --> 06:27:30.560
THAT THAT WOULD BE REPORTED TO

06:27:30.627 --> 06:27:31.995
YOUR LICENSING ENTITY. THAT

06:27:32.062 --> 06:27:33.196
DOESN'T SPECIFY WHAT THEY WOULD

06:27:33.263 --> 06:27:35.599
DO WITH THAT, BUT THAT GIVES OUR

06:27:35.665 --> 06:27:36.967
MEMBERS SOME CONCERNS THAT THEIR

06:27:37.033 --> 06:27:38.401
LICENSE COULD PARTICULARLY BE IN

06:27:38.468 --> 06:27:39.903
JEOPARDY BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T

06:27:39.970 --> 06:27:41.771
SIGNED ON TO THE FRAMEWORK YET

06:27:41.838 --> 06:27:42.672
FOR A VARIETY OF LEGITIMATE

06:27:42.739 --> 06:27:44.641
REASONS WHY THEY MAY NOT. OKAY.

06:27:44.708 --> 06:27:47.177
GREAT. THANKS. SO YOUR LETTERS

06:27:47.243 --> 06:27:48.111
BASICALLY STILL, I READ THE

06:27:48.178 --> 06:27:51.081
LETTER. IT'S STILL KIND OF THE

06:27:51.147 --> 06:27:52.415
SAME. YEAH. AND, SENATOR, WOULD

06:27:52.482 --> 06:27:55.018
YOU MIND WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE

06:27:55.085 --> 06:27:56.853
ON THE ENFORCEMENT. AND THEN

06:27:56.920 --> 06:27:59.723
ALSO THE HAVING PROVIDERS ON THE

06:27:59.789 --> 06:28:01.191
BOARD, IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THE

06:28:01.257 --> 06:28:02.993
INTENT OF THE BILL IS TO HELP

06:28:03.059 --> 06:28:04.894
THE PROVIDERS AT THE END OF THE

06:28:04.961 --> 06:28:06.129
DAY. SO JUST WANTED TO GET YOUR

06:28:06.196 --> 06:28:08.698
COMMENTS ON THOSE. SO AS IT

06:28:08.765 --> 06:28:10.500
STANDS RIGHT NOW, THEY HAVE ONE

06:28:10.567 --> 06:28:11.167
SEAT ON THE BOARD RIGHT NOW. AND

06:28:11.234 --> 06:28:12.836
ORIGINALLY THAT BOARD WAS FIVE

06:28:12.902 --> 06:28:14.838
MEMBERS. ONE SEAT I THOUGHT WAS

06:28:14.904 --> 06:28:16.339
PRETTY FAIR BECAUSE I WAS ALSO

06:28:16.406 --> 06:28:17.707
JUST I WAS ALSO SAYING ONE

06:28:17.774 --> 06:28:19.909
CONSUMER ADVOCATE SEAT AS WELL.

06:28:19.976 --> 06:28:23.079
IF I WERE TO ADD AND SAY TWO

06:28:23.146 --> 06:28:24.381
SIGNATORIES, AND I WOULD TO ME

06:28:24.447 --> 06:28:27.083
MAKE IT FAIR WHEN I ADD ANOTHER

06:28:27.150 --> 06:28:27.684
ONE ON THE CONSUMER ADVOCATE

06:28:27.751 --> 06:28:29.319
SIDE. RIGHT. AND THAT GROWS IT

06:28:29.386 --> 06:28:30.387
EVEN MORE AND MORE. WE JUST

06:28:30.453 --> 06:28:32.689
STARTED GETTING TO FROM THE

06:28:32.756 --> 06:28:33.690
DEPARTMENT BECAUSE ALL THIS WORK

06:28:33.757 --> 06:28:35.058
WAS JUST MOVED FROM ONE

06:28:35.125 --> 06:28:36.226
DEPARTMENT INTO ANOTHER, AND

06:28:36.292 --> 06:28:38.695
IT'S NOW AN HCCI. SO WE ARE

06:28:38.762 --> 06:28:40.096
HOLDING A LITTLE BIT RIGHT NOW

06:28:40.163 --> 06:28:41.931
BECAUSE WE JUST STARTED THOSE

06:28:41.998 --> 06:28:42.465
CONVERSATIONS. AND NOW THE

06:28:42.532 --> 06:28:44.668
DEPARTMENT THAT IT WAS IN WAS, I

06:28:44.734 --> 06:28:46.603
GUESS, THE EXPERT IN THIS IS NO

06:28:46.670 --> 06:28:47.570
LONGER HOLDING THIS INFORMATION

06:28:47.637 --> 06:28:49.372
AND NOW IT'S MOVING TO HK. SO

06:28:49.439 --> 06:28:50.473
WE'RE STILL ONGOING

06:28:50.540 --> 06:28:51.875
CONVERSATIONS WITH THAT. AND

06:28:51.941 --> 06:28:53.143
WE'VE BEEN WORKING REALLY CLOSE

06:28:53.209 --> 06:28:55.178
ON THIS. AND MY GOAL HAS ALWAYS

06:28:55.245 --> 06:28:56.713
BEEN TO HAVE THE EXPERTS AT THE

06:28:56.780 --> 06:28:58.448
TABLE, WHICH IS WHY I'VE BEEN

06:28:58.515 --> 06:28:59.115
TAKING AMENDMENTS AFTER

06:28:59.182 --> 06:29:00.517
AMENDMENT TO ENSURE THAT WE AS

06:29:00.583 --> 06:29:02.786
CLOSE AS POSSIBLE GET TO THEIR

06:29:02.852 --> 06:29:04.254
REPRESENTATIVE AT THE TABLE. AND

06:29:04.320 --> 06:29:06.656
I KNOW C.H.A HAS SUBMITTED

06:29:06.723 --> 06:29:07.757
AMENDMENTS ON THE EXECUTIVE

06:29:07.824 --> 06:29:09.325
LEADERSHIP DEFINITION THAT WE'RE

06:29:09.392 --> 06:29:10.593
LOOKING TO ADDRESS AS WELL,

06:29:10.660 --> 06:29:12.095
BECAUSE I THINK THEIR LETTER

06:29:12.162 --> 06:29:14.197
ALSO STATES THAT THAT PROVISION

06:29:14.264 --> 06:29:15.465
CAN EXCLUDE SOME OF THE

06:29:15.532 --> 06:29:17.467
TECHNICAL EXPERTS, WHICH I DON'T

06:29:17.534 --> 06:29:18.935
WANT TO DO, BUT THEY RECOGNIZE

06:29:19.002 --> 06:29:20.203
THAT WHAT I DON'T WANT TO HAVE

06:29:20.270 --> 06:29:23.106
ON THE BOARD IS THE CFO, THE

06:29:23.173 --> 06:29:25.442
CEO, THE CEO ON THE BOARD, WHO

06:29:25.508 --> 06:29:27.877
HAS A DIRECT CONFLICT OF

06:29:27.944 --> 06:29:29.145
INTEREST THAT POTENTIALLY I'M

06:29:29.212 --> 06:29:30.880
NOT SAYING THEY WOULD, BUT

06:29:30.947 --> 06:29:31.614
POTENTIALLY COULD COMING IN,

06:29:31.681 --> 06:29:34.317
COULD BE COMING IN TO VOTE AS IT

06:29:34.384 --> 06:29:37.320
BETTERS THEIR THEIR RESPECTIVE

06:29:37.387 --> 06:29:39.789
HOSPITAL. I KNOW THAT'S NOT

06:29:39.856 --> 06:29:41.558
THAT'S NOT THE INTENT OF THE

06:29:41.624 --> 06:29:43.026
MEMBERS OF C.H.A, BUT WE WANT TO

06:29:43.093 --> 06:29:44.494
MAKE IT AS, AS, AS CLEAR AS

06:29:44.561 --> 06:29:46.830
POSSIBLE THERE. BUT WE'VE BEEN

06:29:46.896 --> 06:29:47.497
IN CONSTANT COMMUNICATION ON IT.

06:29:47.564 --> 06:29:48.965
WE'RE GOING TO LAND THIS PLANE

06:29:49.032 --> 06:29:50.233
AND THEN THE LICENSE PART Þ ON

06:29:50.300 --> 06:29:51.668
THE ENFORCEMENT. AND THAT GOES

06:29:51.735 --> 06:29:53.236
IN HAND IN HAND WITH WHAT WE

06:29:53.303 --> 06:29:55.004
HEARD WITH THE SKILLED NURSING

06:29:55.071 --> 06:29:56.940
FACILITIES. AND IT MIGHT BE IT

06:29:57.006 --> 06:29:59.242
IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT BECAUSE AT

06:29:59.309 --> 06:30:00.376
LEAST FOR THE SKILLED NURSING

06:30:00.443 --> 06:30:01.411
FACILITIES, THERE IS AN OFF

06:30:01.478 --> 06:30:02.479
RAMP. BUT THE CONTRACTS FOR THIS

06:30:02.545 --> 06:30:04.314
HAS ALREADY BEEN IN PLACE. THERE

06:30:04.380 --> 06:30:05.782
HAS ALREADY BEEN A MANDATE TO

06:30:05.849 --> 06:30:07.016
PARTICIPATE IN DATA EXCHANGE

06:30:07.083 --> 06:30:08.918
SHARING. THAT'S BEEN EVEN

06:30:08.985 --> 06:30:10.286
WITHOUT MY BILL IN PLACE RIGHT

06:30:10.353 --> 06:30:12.055
NOW, AND THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF

06:30:12.122 --> 06:30:14.724
TIME TO GET TO THIS PLACE, AND

06:30:14.791 --> 06:30:17.026
THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE HARDER TO

06:30:17.093 --> 06:30:18.862
GET TO, BUT WE'RE STILL IN

06:30:18.928 --> 06:30:20.330
COMMUNICATION. BUT I JUST WANT

06:30:20.396 --> 06:30:22.031
TO MAKE SURE SINCE THEY'VE BEEN

06:30:22.098 --> 06:30:22.599
IN IN COLLABORATION ON THIS

06:30:22.665 --> 06:30:24.100
ISSUE FOR ALMOST FOUR YEARS ON

06:30:24.167 --> 06:30:26.169
THIS, THERE HAS BEEN TIME TO BE

06:30:26.236 --> 06:30:28.004
PREPARED TO SHARE THIS DATA. AND

06:30:28.071 --> 06:30:31.141
MY BILL IS NOT SAYING THAT YOU I

06:30:31.207 --> 06:30:32.776
MEAN, MY BILL IS NOT CHANGING

06:30:32.842 --> 06:30:34.544
THE TIMELINE THAT'S BEEN IMPOSED

06:30:34.611 --> 06:30:36.012
BEFORE. WE JUST WANT TO MAKE

06:30:36.079 --> 06:30:37.380
SURE THE TIMELINE THAT'S BEEN

06:30:37.447 --> 06:30:39.082
IMPOSED BEFORE ACTUALLY HAPPENS,

06:30:39.149 --> 06:30:40.350
BECAUSE WE'RE SEEING THAT EVEN

06:30:40.416 --> 06:30:42.352
WITH THAT TIMELINE THAT HAS BEEN

06:30:42.418 --> 06:30:44.220
IMPOSED, SOME MEMBER THERE ARE A

06:30:44.287 --> 06:30:44.988
LOT OF ENTITIES THAT STILL

06:30:45.054 --> 06:30:47.123
HAVEN'T SIGNED ON TO DO IT, AND

06:30:47.190 --> 06:30:48.091
THERE ARE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE

06:30:48.158 --> 06:30:49.692
REQUIRING A CONTRACT SIGNATURE

06:30:49.759 --> 06:30:50.727
TO DO DATA EXCHANGE FRAMEWORK TO

06:30:50.794 --> 06:30:52.862
WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT. SO

06:30:52.929 --> 06:30:54.764
EVEN WITH EVEN WITHOUT OUR

06:30:54.831 --> 06:30:56.132
LANGUAGE THAT SAYS YOU HAVE TO

06:30:56.199 --> 06:30:57.534
BE IN CONTRACT, THE DEPARTMENT

06:30:57.600 --> 06:30:59.669
IS STILL ASKING OF THAT AS A

06:30:59.736 --> 06:31:01.471
REQUIREMENT TO DO BUSINESS. HOW

06:31:01.538 --> 06:31:03.173
DOES THIS WORK WITH YOU KNOW, WE

06:31:03.239 --> 06:31:05.742
HAVE A LOT OF ONLINE PLATFORMS

06:31:05.809 --> 06:31:08.711
NOW. PRESCRIBERS AND PROVIDERS

06:31:08.778 --> 06:31:10.747
THAT ARE PROVIDING SERVICES

06:31:10.814 --> 06:31:12.615
ONLINE, SORT OF OUTSIDE OF ANY

06:31:12.682 --> 06:31:15.151
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. I'M NOT

06:31:15.218 --> 06:31:16.252
NECESSARILY AGAINST THAT. I'M

06:31:16.319 --> 06:31:18.955
PRO THAT ACTUALLY. BUT SOMEBODY

06:31:19.022 --> 06:31:21.324
COULD PRESCRIBE ONE MEDICATION

06:31:21.391 --> 06:31:23.459
TO TREAT SOMETHING AND THEN THEY

06:31:23.526 --> 06:31:25.094
GO TO THEIR NORMAL PRIMARY, YOU

06:31:25.161 --> 06:31:27.030
KNOW, AND GET IT IS DOES THIS

06:31:27.096 --> 06:31:28.231
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THOSE OR DOES

06:31:28.298 --> 06:31:30.366
IT LEAVE FLEXIBILITY FOR THIS

06:31:30.433 --> 06:31:32.168
BOARD OR HOW DOES THAT WORK?

06:31:32.235 --> 06:31:33.336
IT'S A GREAT QUESTION THAT I

06:31:33.403 --> 06:31:36.172
HAVE NOT BEEN ASKED YET, SO I

06:31:36.239 --> 06:31:37.207
DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR YOU. IF

06:31:37.273 --> 06:31:38.441
I COULD TURN TO MY WITNESS.

06:31:38.508 --> 06:31:40.076
SURE. THROUGH THE CHAIR, I.

06:31:40.143 --> 06:31:41.211
WELL, ONE THING I THINK IS

06:31:41.277 --> 06:31:42.745
REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT RIGHT

06:31:42.812 --> 06:31:44.280
NOW, AS MAX ALLUDED TO, THERE'S

06:31:44.347 --> 06:31:46.616
A LOT OF CONFUSION AROUND WHAT

06:31:46.683 --> 06:31:49.619
THE DEFINITIONS OF PROVIDERS

06:31:49.686 --> 06:31:51.521
ACTUALLY MEAN. AND SOME OF THESE

06:31:51.588 --> 06:31:54.791
ONLINE ONLY, NO PHYSICAL ADDRESS

06:31:54.858 --> 06:31:55.491
PROVIDERS. THERE'S BEEN

06:31:55.558 --> 06:31:56.826
QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT. AND

06:31:56.893 --> 06:31:58.528
BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T GRANTED THE

06:31:58.595 --> 06:32:00.296
STATE FORMAL AUTHORITY TO

06:32:00.363 --> 06:32:01.130
OVERSEE AND IMPLEMENT THE DATA

06:32:01.197 --> 06:32:02.999
EXCHANGE FRAMEWORK, WE HAVEN'T

06:32:03.066 --> 06:32:05.335
BEEN ABLE TO GET CLARIFYING

06:32:05.401 --> 06:32:06.936
GUIDANCE FROM THE OFFICE

06:32:07.003 --> 06:32:08.071
OVERSEEING THE DATA EXCHANGE

06:32:08.137 --> 06:32:09.239
FRAMEWORK AT THIS POINT. SO

06:32:09.305 --> 06:32:12.508
THAT'S AN INTENT OF THE BILL AND

06:32:12.575 --> 06:32:13.543
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE WE'RE

06:32:13.610 --> 06:32:14.978
REALLY HOPING TO ACCOMPLISH IS

06:32:15.044 --> 06:32:16.112
THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY HAVE

06:32:16.179 --> 06:32:17.480
SOMEONE AT THE STATE LEVEL

06:32:17.547 --> 06:32:18.748
ANSWERING THOSE TYPES OF

06:32:18.815 --> 06:32:20.383
QUESTIONS. WHAT I WOULD SAY IS,

06:32:20.450 --> 06:32:21.951
AS THAT'S ANSWERED, WE DON'T

06:32:22.018 --> 06:32:24.454
WANT TO DISINCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO

06:32:24.520 --> 06:32:25.655
FROM. AND I'M SURE YOU DON'T

06:32:25.722 --> 06:32:28.157
EITHER. GOING TO THEIR PRIMARY

06:32:28.224 --> 06:32:29.592
CARE PHYSICIAN, YOU KNOW, IF

06:32:29.659 --> 06:32:31.828
THEY'RE UNABLE TO MAYBE GET A

06:32:31.895 --> 06:32:32.962
PRESCRIPTION OR SOME KIND OF

06:32:33.029 --> 06:32:34.530
CARE FROM THEIR PRIMARY AND SO

06:32:34.597 --> 06:32:36.666
THEY GO ONLINE OR SOMETHING LIKE

06:32:36.733 --> 06:32:37.634
THAT, RIGHT? BECAUSE MAYBE THEY

06:32:37.700 --> 06:32:39.035
HAVE THE DATA HERE IN

06:32:39.102 --> 06:32:41.304
CALIFORNIA, THE PRIMARY CARE

06:32:41.371 --> 06:32:42.171
PHYSICIANS. BUT THE, YOU KNOW,

06:32:42.238 --> 06:32:43.806
THE PLATFORMS DON'T, WHICH

06:32:43.873 --> 06:32:45.909
AGAIN, I DON'T WANT TO BE OVERLY

06:32:45.975 --> 06:32:46.542
CRITICAL OF THE PLATFORMS. BUT

06:32:46.609 --> 06:32:48.211
THE REALITY IS, YOU KNOW, THERE

06:32:48.278 --> 06:32:49.779
SEEMS TO BE THERE'S RULES THAT

06:32:49.846 --> 06:32:52.782
THOSE PROVIDERS MAY NOT HAVE TO

06:32:52.849 --> 06:32:54.217
COMPLY WITH. AND SO I'M

06:32:54.284 --> 06:32:55.318
INTERESTED IN THAT. BUT

06:32:55.385 --> 06:32:56.352
REGARDLESS OF THAT ASSEMBLY

06:32:56.419 --> 06:32:58.521
MEMBER, A CONSUMER'S ABILITY TO

06:32:58.588 --> 06:33:00.290
CHOOSE WHO THEY GO GET TREATMENT

06:33:00.356 --> 06:33:01.958
DOESN'T GET IMPACTED BY THIS

06:33:02.025 --> 06:33:04.027
BILL. YEAH. YEAH. DEFINITELY.

06:33:04.093 --> 06:33:06.362
OKAY. ALL RIGHT. GREAT. THANKS.

06:33:06.429 --> 06:33:08.631
WELL, I'LL DECIDE WHEN MY NAME'S

06:33:08.698 --> 06:33:09.265
CALLED. JUST OKAY. THANK YOU.

06:33:09.332 --> 06:33:11.534
CALL HIM LAST. GIVE HIM MORE

06:33:11.601 --> 06:33:15.004
TIME. OKAY. SO REMEMBER WHEN. SO

06:33:15.071 --> 06:33:17.640
THIS BOARD IS RESPONSIBLE. FIRST

06:33:17.707 --> 06:33:20.109
OF ALL I'M SUPPORTING THE BILL.

06:33:20.176 --> 06:33:22.478
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF BIG

06:33:22.545 --> 06:33:25.081
BENEFITS WITH WITH SHARING

06:33:25.148 --> 06:33:26.149
INFORMATION AS YOU MENTIONED

06:33:26.215 --> 06:33:27.550
WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO DIFFERENT

06:33:27.617 --> 06:33:29.385
PROVIDERS, THIS BOARD IS

06:33:29.452 --> 06:33:30.887
PARTIALLY IS LOOKING AT THE

06:33:30.954 --> 06:33:33.523
PRIVACY ISSUES. IS IT IS WHAT

06:33:33.589 --> 06:33:35.558
YOU'RE SAYING IS MAKING SURE

06:33:35.625 --> 06:33:37.760
THAT THE PRIVACY CONTROLS ARE IN

06:33:37.827 --> 06:33:40.129
PLACE. WELL, REGARDLESS OF THE

06:33:40.196 --> 06:33:42.699
BOARD, LIKE THE CHAIR MENTIONED,

06:33:42.765 --> 06:33:44.300
WHENEVER WE'RE DEALING WITH DATA

06:33:44.367 --> 06:33:46.169
EXCHANGE, THOSE POLICIES ARE

06:33:46.235 --> 06:33:48.604
STILL IN EFFECT. AND I THINK THE

06:33:48.671 --> 06:33:49.672
ANALYSIS DOES A REALLY GOOD JOB

06:33:49.739 --> 06:33:51.874
OF EXPLAINING THAT AND SAYING

06:33:51.941 --> 06:33:53.643
THAT THERE ARE ROBUST PRIVACY

06:33:53.710 --> 06:33:55.411
PROTECTIONS ALREADY. BUT NOW

06:33:55.478 --> 06:33:57.680
WE'RE GOING TO REQUIRE A BOARD

06:33:57.747 --> 06:34:00.049
MEMBER TO BE TO HAVE THE PRIVACY

06:34:00.116 --> 06:34:01.584
EXPERT. BUT EVERYTHING THAT IS

06:34:01.651 --> 06:34:04.454
IN CALIFORNIA'S RIGHT TO PRIVACY

06:34:04.520 --> 06:34:05.788
EXISTS REGARDLESS OF THIS BOARD.

06:34:05.855 --> 06:34:07.290
AND I WOULD ARGUE I WOULD SAY

06:34:07.357 --> 06:34:09.292
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SAME COIN

06:34:09.359 --> 06:34:11.260
IS CYBERSECURITY, BECAUSE YOU

06:34:11.327 --> 06:34:14.597
CAN HAVE ALL THE PRIVACY LAWS

06:34:14.664 --> 06:34:16.399
AND CONTROLS IN PLACE, AND IF

06:34:16.466 --> 06:34:17.767
THERE'S A BREACH, THEN NONE OF

06:34:17.834 --> 06:34:20.703
THAT MATTERS. SO HOPEFULLY THERE

06:34:20.770 --> 06:34:24.607
IS A HUGE EMPHASIS ON THAT ALSO.

06:34:24.674 --> 06:34:27.076
AND THE BOARD CAN PUT TOGETHER

06:34:27.143 --> 06:34:28.478
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ON HOW

06:34:28.544 --> 06:34:29.946
TO RESPOND TO A CYBER SECURITY

06:34:30.013 --> 06:34:32.148
OR HOW TO PREVENT, AS MUCH AS

06:34:32.215 --> 06:34:33.583
POSSIBLE, THE CYBER SECURITY

06:34:33.649 --> 06:34:35.518
LEADS. OKAY. THANK YOU FOR THAT.

06:34:35.585 --> 06:34:37.553
AND THEN I JUST WANT TO GO BACK

06:34:37.620 --> 06:34:39.322
AGAIN TO THE HOSPITAL

06:34:39.389 --> 06:34:41.524
ASSOCIATION SAYING THAT THEIR

06:34:41.591 --> 06:34:42.892
REQUEST TO HAVE ONE MORE

06:34:42.959 --> 06:34:45.461
SIGNATORY ON THE ON THE

06:34:45.528 --> 06:34:48.464
COMMITTEE. BUT AND I UNDERSTAND

06:34:48.531 --> 06:34:50.466
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH YOUR OWN

06:34:50.533 --> 06:34:51.634
PROCESS AS TO HOW MANY THERE

06:34:51.701 --> 06:34:53.403
SHOULD BE. BUT I DO SIT ON THE

06:34:53.469 --> 06:34:55.505
CRADLE TO CAREER GOVERNING

06:34:55.571 --> 06:34:56.873
BOARD, AND IT'S A HUGE BOARD, I

06:34:56.939 --> 06:34:59.942
DON'T KNOW, 25, 26 PEOPLE AND

06:35:00.009 --> 06:35:02.278
HALF OF THEM ARE DATA PROVIDERS.

06:35:02.345 --> 06:35:05.615
SO THEY'RE PROVIDING A LOT OF

06:35:05.681 --> 06:35:06.983
EXPERTISE TO THE BOARD. BUT I

06:35:07.050 --> 06:35:08.818
THOUGHT I WOULD JUST SHARE THAT

06:35:08.885 --> 06:35:12.121
JUST, YOU KNOW, IF IT

06:35:12.188 --> 06:35:13.389
STRENGTHENS THE HOSPITAL'S

06:35:13.456 --> 06:35:14.957
ARGUMENT AT ALL. AND WHAT I'VE

06:35:15.024 --> 06:35:16.826
SHARED IN PREVIOUS COMMITTEES IS

06:35:16.893 --> 06:35:18.561
THAT THEY ARE THE ONES THAT ARE

06:35:18.628 --> 06:35:20.363
SHARING THE DATA. THEY'RE THE

06:35:20.430 --> 06:35:21.998
ONES IN CHARGE, SINCE THEY'RE

06:35:22.065 --> 06:35:24.367
THE ONES RUNNING THESE THESE

06:35:24.434 --> 06:35:25.401
ENTITIES. SO I WANT THEM AT THE

06:35:25.468 --> 06:35:26.969
BOARD, AND I'VE BEEN TRYING TO

06:35:27.036 --> 06:35:28.938
BE AS FAIR AS POSSIBLE TO ALSO

06:35:29.005 --> 06:35:30.940
HAVE CONSUMER ADVOCATES AND

06:35:31.007 --> 06:35:32.208
OTHER REPRESENTATIVES HAVE A

06:35:32.275 --> 06:35:35.912
VOTING PLACE AS WELL. SO WHILE

06:35:35.978 --> 06:35:38.014
AT THE SAME TIME AS A MEMBER NOT

06:35:38.081 --> 06:35:39.849
MAKING A 20 BOARD, 20 MEMBER

06:35:39.916 --> 06:35:41.184
BOARD, WHICH THAT WOULD JUST BE

06:35:41.250 --> 06:35:42.985
BUREAUCRACY, RIGHT? SO IT'S

06:35:43.052 --> 06:35:45.021
KEEPING IT AS LOW AS POSSIBLE AS

06:35:45.088 --> 06:35:46.589
MINIMUM MEMBERS AS POSSIBLE,

06:35:46.656 --> 06:35:47.957
HAVING REPRESENTATION FROM

06:35:48.024 --> 06:35:49.826
EVERYONE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE,

06:35:49.892 --> 06:35:52.161
AND NOT PUTTING RESTRICTIONS ON

06:35:52.228 --> 06:35:53.362
THE MEMBERS THAT PARTICIPATE AS

06:35:53.429 --> 06:35:56.032
MUCH AS POSSIBLE. WHICH IS WHY I

06:35:56.099 --> 06:35:56.933
FELT IF I SAID ONE CONSUMER

06:35:56.999 --> 06:35:57.967
ADVOCATE, THEN IT'S ONE

06:35:58.034 --> 06:35:59.235
SIGNATORY, BUT STILL LOOKING AT

06:35:59.302 --> 06:36:00.870
IT BECAUSE I KNOW I STILL NEED

06:36:00.937 --> 06:36:02.538
TO LAND THE PLANE ON THE

06:36:02.605 --> 06:36:03.039
DEFINITION OF EXECUTIVE

06:36:03.106 --> 06:36:03.873
LEADERSHIP, BECAUSE I DO

06:36:03.940 --> 06:36:05.074
RECOGNIZE THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES

06:36:05.141 --> 06:36:06.409
THAT HAVE RESTRICTIONS STILL IN

06:36:06.476 --> 06:36:09.412
MY BILL AS TO HOW SOMEONE CAN

06:36:09.479 --> 06:36:11.080
PARTICIPATE. SO I'M STILL OPEN

06:36:11.147 --> 06:36:13.049
WITH, WITH WITH WORKING THAT

06:36:13.116 --> 06:36:14.984
LANGUAGE OUT. ALL RIGHT. THANK

06:36:15.051 --> 06:36:18.287
YOU. THANK YOU. SEEING NO

06:36:18.354 --> 06:36:20.123
ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR

06:36:20.189 --> 06:36:21.491
COMMENTS, I WANT TO THANK YOU,

06:36:21.557 --> 06:36:23.159
SENATOR, FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS.

06:36:23.226 --> 06:36:26.496
I ALSO THINK I WANT TO NOTE I

06:36:26.562 --> 06:36:27.463
PASSED A BILL A COUPLE OF YEARS

06:36:27.530 --> 06:36:28.397
AGO THAT MAKES SURE THAT AS WE

06:36:28.464 --> 06:36:30.867
MOVE TO THE DATA EXCHANGE, WE'RE

06:36:30.933 --> 06:36:33.402
NOT EXPORTING SENSITIVE

06:36:33.469 --> 06:36:35.238
INFORMATION OUT OF CALIFORNIA ON

06:36:35.304 --> 06:36:36.973
ABORTION AND OTHER SENSITIVE

06:36:37.039 --> 06:36:38.875
SERVICES. AND THIS BOARD WILL BE

06:36:38.941 --> 06:36:40.109
CRITICAL IN HELPING TO ENSURE

06:36:40.176 --> 06:36:41.711
THAT ACTUALLY COMES TO FRUITION.

06:36:41.777 --> 06:36:44.280
AND SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR

06:36:44.347 --> 06:36:45.248
THAT AND WOULD LOVE TO BE ADDED

06:36:45.314 --> 06:36:46.849
AS A COAUTHOR. COAUTHOR, IF

06:36:46.916 --> 06:36:50.286
YOU'LL HAVE ME. AND BECAUSE I DO

06:36:50.353 --> 06:36:52.155
THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT, HAVING

06:36:52.221 --> 06:36:53.923
DONE THAT WORK AND SORT OF

06:36:53.990 --> 06:36:54.857
HEARING, WELL, WILL IT ACTUALLY

06:36:54.924 --> 06:36:56.359
MATTER? LIKE I THINK THIS WILL

06:36:56.425 --> 06:36:57.927
MAKE THAT WORK MATTER. SO I

06:36:57.994 --> 06:36:59.262
APPRECIATE THAT. AND WITH THAT,

06:36:59.328 --> 06:37:01.097
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE? NO.

06:37:01.164 --> 06:37:02.765
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING

06:37:02.832 --> 06:37:04.300
THAT UP. BUT I WAS TELLING

06:37:04.367 --> 06:37:06.335
MYSELF TO REMIND THE, THE, THE

06:37:06.402 --> 06:37:07.003
COMMITTEE HERE THAT, YES, THAT

06:37:07.069 --> 06:37:08.704
IS IN THE BILL THAT WE WANT TO

06:37:08.771 --> 06:37:10.706
MAKE SURE WE ARE NOT APPLYING

06:37:10.773 --> 06:37:11.874
THE EXCHANGE OF HEALTH

06:37:11.941 --> 06:37:12.942
INFORMATION RELATED TO ABORTION,

06:37:13.009 --> 06:37:14.110
ABORTION RELATED SERVICES,

06:37:14.177 --> 06:37:14.810
GENDER AFFIRMING CARE,

06:37:14.877 --> 06:37:16.179
IMMIGRATION OR CITIZENSHIP

06:37:16.245 --> 06:37:17.980
STATUS OR PLACE OF BIRTH. THAT'S

06:37:18.047 --> 06:37:19.482
STILL VERY IMPORTANT

06:37:19.549 --> 06:37:20.616
PROTECTIONS. LISTEN, WE ALL ARE

06:37:20.683 --> 06:37:22.752
TRYING TO REMOVE RED TAPE

06:37:22.818 --> 06:37:23.886
BUREAUCRACY FROM THE STATE OF

06:37:23.953 --> 06:37:25.054
CALIFORNIA. ONE WAY WE CAN DO

06:37:25.121 --> 06:37:27.089
THAT IS MAKE SURE THAT ONE

06:37:27.156 --> 06:37:28.291
COUNTY IS TALKING TO ANOTHER

06:37:28.357 --> 06:37:29.725
COUNTY, OR WITHIN EVEN THE SAME

06:37:29.792 --> 06:37:30.560
COUNTY. ONE PROVIDER IS TALKING

06:37:30.626 --> 06:37:32.728
TO ANOTHER PROVIDER THAT BRINGS

06:37:32.795 --> 06:37:34.664
MORE ACCESS TO EQUITABLE HEALTH

06:37:34.730 --> 06:37:36.265
CARE, ACCESS TO THE RIGHT KIND

06:37:36.332 --> 06:37:38.000
OF CARE THAT WE'RE NOT BEING

06:37:38.067 --> 06:37:39.936
DUPLICATIVE, DUPLICATIVE IN OUR

06:37:40.002 --> 06:37:42.505

CONSUMERS AND OUR PATIENTS. WITH

06:37:44.440 --> 06:37:46.542
THAT, THIS IS A STEP IN THE

06:37:46.609 --> 06:37:47.376
RIGHT DIRECTION TO PUT POLICIES

06:37:47.443 --> 06:37:48.978
AND PROCEDURES TO ENSURE THAT

06:37:49.045 --> 06:37:51.447
THE WAY WE SHARE OUR DATA IS IN

06:37:51.514 --> 06:37:54.116
AS MOST AS EFFICIENT AND SAFE AS

06:37:54.183 --> 06:37:56.586
POSSIBLE, WITHOUT ASKING

06:37:56.652 --> 06:37:59.722
