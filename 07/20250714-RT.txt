MAJOR PUBLIC TRANSIT SYSTEMS

TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS BART,

00:34:06.911 --> 00:34:09.380
CALTRAIN, MUNI, AC TRANSIT, ARE

00:34:09.447 --> 00:34:11.883
FACING AN UNPRECEDENTED CRISIS.

00:34:11.949 --> 00:34:14.218
THESE AGENCIES WERE ALREADY

00:34:14.285 --> 00:34:15.520
UNDERFUNDED AND OVERLY RELIANT

00:34:15.586 --> 00:34:19.190
ON FARE REVENUE. THE PANDEMIC

00:34:19.257 --> 00:34:20.992
EXPOSED THIS FUNDING WEAKNESS BY

00:34:21.058 --> 00:34:22.693
SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGING COMMUTE

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.462
PATTERNS, REDUCING FARE REVENUES

00:34:24.529 --> 00:34:26.731
AND EXACERBATING OPERATING

00:34:26.798 --> 00:34:28.166
SHORTFALLS FOR SOME OF OUR MOST

00:34:28.232 --> 00:34:30.701
FARE RELIANT TRANSIT SYSTEMS.

00:34:30.768 --> 00:34:31.836
WHILE EMERGENCY FEDERAL AND

00:34:31.903 --> 00:34:33.905
STATE FUNDING ALLOW TRANSIT

00:34:33.971 --> 00:34:35.706
ACROSS THE STATE TO MAINTAIN

00:34:35.773 --> 00:34:38.609
MAINTAIN SERVICE, THAT AID IS

00:34:38.676 --> 00:34:41.212
TEMPORARY. A SUSTAINABLE FUNDING

00:34:41.279 --> 00:34:42.847
SOLUTION IS NECESSARY TO PREVENT

00:34:42.914 --> 00:34:44.649
BAY AREA TRANSIT SYSTEMS FROM

00:34:44.715 --> 00:34:46.918
HAVING TO IMPLEMENT DEVASTATING

00:34:46.984 --> 00:34:49.153
SERVICE CUTS. A STATE LEÓN IN

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:50.855
THIS YEAR'S BUDGET THAT WOULD

00:34:50.922 --> 00:34:52.957
PROVIDE MORE FUNDING IS

00:34:53.024 --> 00:34:54.459
CONTINGENT ON THE PASSAGE OF

00:34:54.525 --> 00:34:57.328
THIS MEASURE. IF WE DO NOTHING,

00:34:57.395 --> 00:34:59.030
THESE AGENCIES WILL BE FORCED TO

00:34:59.096 --> 00:35:00.898
MAKE DEVASTATING CUTS, CLOSING

00:35:00.965 --> 00:35:03.468
BART STATIONS, REDUCING MUNI

00:35:03.534 --> 00:35:06.437
SERVICE BY UP TO 50%, AND

00:35:06.504 --> 00:35:07.805
ELIMINATING LINES ENTIRELY

00:35:07.872 --> 00:35:09.273
ACROSS ALL OF OUR TRANSIT

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.008
SYSTEMS, INCLUDING CALTRAIN AND

00:35:11.075 --> 00:35:13.945
AC TRANSIT. THE CONSEQUENCES OF

00:35:14.011 --> 00:35:15.780
INACTION ARE CLEAR MORE TRAFFIC,

00:35:15.847 --> 00:35:17.615
MORE POLLUTION, AND MORE PEOPLE

00:35:17.682 --> 00:35:19.217
LEFT BEHIND, ESPECIALLY THE

00:35:19.283 --> 00:35:21.285
WORKING CLASS RIDERS, SENIORS,

00:35:21.352 --> 00:35:23.221
AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WHO

00:35:23.287 --> 00:35:25.790
DEPEND MOST ON PUBLIC TRANSIT.

00:35:25.857 --> 00:35:28.659
SB 63 GIVES THE REGION A PATH

00:35:28.726 --> 00:35:30.161
FORWARD. IT ALLOWS VOTERS TO

00:35:30.228 --> 00:35:31.829
APPROVE A SUSTAINABLE FUNDING

00:35:31.896 --> 00:35:33.698
SOURCE, BUT IT DOESN'T DO SO

00:35:33.764 --> 00:35:36.601
BLINDLY. THIS BILL INCLUDES

00:35:36.667 --> 00:35:38.703
STRONG ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES

00:35:38.769 --> 00:35:39.837
TO RECEIVE FUNDING FOR THE

00:35:39.904 --> 00:35:41.606
REGIONAL MEASURE. BART,

00:35:41.672 --> 00:35:43.808
CALTRAIN, MUNI, AND AC TRANSIT

00:35:43.875 --> 00:35:45.176
ARE REQUIRED TO BE IN COMPLIANCE

00:35:45.243 --> 00:35:47.378
WITH REGIONAL NETWORK MANAGEMENT

00:35:47.445 --> 00:35:49.480
POLICIES, UNDERGO AN INDEPENDENT

00:35:49.547 --> 00:35:51.816
FINANCIAL EFFICIENCY REVIEW, AND

00:35:51.883 --> 00:35:53.851
ADOPT IDENTIFIED COST SAVING

00:35:53.918 --> 00:35:55.953
MEASURES. GIVEN THAT THESE ARE

00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:57.755
COMPLEX MATTERS THAT REQUIRE

00:35:57.822 --> 00:35:59.290
DILIGENT, HYPER LOCAL AND

00:35:59.357 --> 00:36:01.826
REGIONAL ENGAGEMENT, THIS BILL

00:36:01.893 --> 00:36:03.194
CONTINUES TO BE A WORK IN

00:36:03.261 --> 00:36:05.029
PROGRESS. THE AUTHORS HAVE

00:36:05.096 --> 00:36:06.063
APPRECIATED THE DEEP INTEREST

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:07.732
AND ENGAGEMENT BY ALL COUNTIES

00:36:07.798 --> 00:36:09.333
THAT MAY BE A PART OF THE

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.102
MEASURE, AND THEY REMAIN

00:36:11.168 --> 00:36:12.570
OPTIMISTIC THAT THEY WILL BE

00:36:12.637 --> 00:36:14.005
ABLE TO AGREE ON AN EXPENDITURE

00:36:14.071 --> 00:36:16.908
PLAN IN THE NEXT MONTH. SB 63

00:36:16.974 --> 00:36:19.010
GIVES THE BAY AREA THE TOOLS IT

00:36:19.076 --> 00:36:21.145
NEEDS TO TAKE CARE OF ITS OWN

00:36:21.212 --> 00:36:23.681
TRANSIT SYSTEM, SO WE DON'T HAVE

00:36:23.748 --> 00:36:25.216
TO KEEP COMING BACK TO THE STATE

00:36:25.283 --> 00:36:27.084
YEAR AFTER YEAR ASKING FOR

00:36:27.151 --> 00:36:28.386
EMERGENCY FUNDING. THAT'S WHAT

00:36:28.452 --> 00:36:30.288
LOCAL SELF-HELP LOOKS LIKE, AND

00:36:30.354 --> 00:36:32.757
IT'S WHAT LONG TERM STABILITY

00:36:32.823 --> 00:36:34.125

00:37:03.754 --> 00:37:06.290
BART WAS A MODEL FOR

00:37:06.357 --> 00:37:07.692
SELF-SUFFICIENCY, WITH MORE THAN

00:37:07.758 --> 00:37:09.427
TWO THIRDS OF OUR OPERATING

HOWEVER, WE CANNOT CUT OUR WAY

00:37:29.714 --> 00:37:32.149
OUT OF THIS CRISIS, AND WE WILL

00:37:32.216 --> 00:37:36.053
FACE A $350 MILLION PLUS DEFICIT

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:39.023
STARTING IN FISCAL YEAR 27.

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:40.825
WE'RE THANKFUL FOR THIS YEAR'S

00:37:40.891 --> 00:37:43.327
STATE BUDGET PRESERVES THAT THE

00:37:43.394 --> 00:37:45.396
BUDGET PRESERVES TRANSIT FUNDING

00:37:45.463 --> 00:37:49.333
AND PROVIDES FOR $750 MILLION AS

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:51.602
A LOAN TO BART, SAN FRANCISCO,

00:37:51.669 --> 00:37:54.972
MUNI, CALTRAIN, AND AC TRANSIT.

00:37:55.039 --> 00:37:56.574
THIS WILL ALLOW US TO GET

00:37:56.641 --> 00:37:58.676
THROUGH TO NGUYEN REGIONAL

00:37:58.743 --> 00:38:00.611
MEASURE. FUNDS WOULD START

00:38:00.678 --> 00:38:02.813
FLOWING IN THE CALENDAR YEAR,

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:06.017
FISCAL YEAR OF 27 CALENDAR YEAR.

00:38:06.083 --> 00:38:08.152
IF BART IS FORCED TO DRASTICALLY

00:38:08.219 --> 00:38:09.920
REDUCE SERVICE OR CLOSE

00:38:09.987 --> 00:38:11.822
STATIONS, CONNECTING TRANSIT

00:38:11.889 --> 00:38:13.190
AGENCIES WILL BE AFFECTED.

00:38:13.257 --> 00:38:14.792
TRANSIT DEPENDENT INDIVIDUALS

00:38:14.859 --> 00:38:17.895
WILL BE LEFT BEHIND. TRAFFIC

00:38:17.962 --> 00:38:19.697
CONGESTION WILL WORSEN, AND THE

00:38:19.764 --> 00:38:21.866
BAY AREA'S ECONOMY WILL SUFFER.

00:38:21.932 --> 00:38:24.735
THIS IS WHY SB 63 IS SO

00:38:24.802 --> 00:38:26.470
IMPORTANT TO THE BAY AREA AS A

00:38:26.537 --> 00:38:28.305
WHOLE. THIS MEASURE IS NOT A

00:38:28.372 --> 00:38:30.141
GREEN LIGHT TO CONTINUE THE

00:38:30.207 --> 00:38:32.243
STATUS QUO. WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF

00:38:32.309 --> 00:38:35.112
THE FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY AND

00:38:35.179 --> 00:38:37.648
ACCOUNTABILITY PROVISIONS. WE

00:38:37.715 --> 00:38:39.850
HAVE ALSO BEEN LASER FOCUSED ON

00:38:39.917 --> 00:38:41.285
IMPROVING THE CUSTOMER

00:38:41.352 --> 00:38:42.353
EXPERIENCE THROUGH BETTER

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:44.822
SERVICE, QUALITY, SAFETY AND

00:38:44.889 --> 00:38:45.923
CLEANLINESS. THROUGH THESE

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:47.725
EFFORTS, BART'S CUSTOMER

00:38:47.792 --> 00:38:49.226
SATISFACTION RATE IS AT ITS

00:38:49.293 --> 00:38:51.729
HIGHEST IN TEN YEARS.

00:38:51.796 --> 00:38:53.464
ADDITIONALLY, NEW FAREGATES TO

00:38:53.531 --> 00:38:54.732
HELP PREVENT FARE EVASION ARE

00:38:54.799 --> 00:38:57.435
NOW INSTALLED AT 40 OF OUR 50

00:38:57.501 --> 00:39:00.371
STATIONS AND WILL BE COMPLETED

00:39:00.438 --> 00:39:02.840

00:39:02.907 --> 00:39:04.709
WE APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE

00:39:04.775 --> 00:39:07.211
AUTHORS. THE METROPOLITAN

00:39:12.383 --> 00:39:14.051

ACKNOWLEDGES BART'S NEED FOR A

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:17.955
SUSTAINABLE REVENUE FUTURE.

00:39:18.022 --> 00:39:20.891
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME, AND I

AFTERNOON, CHAIR GIBSON AND

00:39:29.533 --> 00:39:30.935
MEMBERS. I'M SUE NOWAK. I'M THE

00:39:31.001 --> 00:39:32.436
MAYOR OF PLEASANT HILL AND THE

00:39:32.503 --> 00:39:34.338
CHAIR OF THE METROPOLITAN

00:39:34.405 --> 00:39:35.639
TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. I'M

00:39:35.706 --> 00:39:37.041
HERE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF

00:39:37.108 --> 00:39:40.010
SB 63, WHICH WOULD GIVE BAY AREA

00:39:40.077 --> 00:39:41.812
VOTERS THE ABILITY TO DECIDE

00:39:41.879 --> 00:39:44.014
WHETHER TO RAISE LOCAL FUNDS TO

00:39:44.081 --> 00:39:45.249
SUSTAIN AND IMPROVE PUBLIC

00:39:45.316 --> 00:39:47.585
TRANSIT. TRANSIT IS ESSENTIAL TO

00:39:47.651 --> 00:39:50.054
THE BAY AREA'S ECONOMY. IT

00:39:50.121 --> 00:39:51.856
UNDERPINS OUR HOUSING GOALS,

00:39:51.922 --> 00:39:53.457
KEEPS PEOPLE MOVING, AND WITHOUT

00:39:53.524 --> 00:39:55.392
IT WE CAN'T MEET OUR CLIMATE

00:39:55.459 --> 00:39:57.628
GOALS. BUT ITS IMPORTANCE GOES

00:39:57.695 --> 00:39:58.996
BEYOND OUR REGION. THE BAY AREA

00:39:59.063 --> 00:40:00.898
IS A MAJOR DRIVER OF THE

00:40:00.965 --> 00:40:02.199
CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY.

00:40:02.266 --> 00:40:03.768
CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY A STRONG

00:40:03.834 --> 00:40:05.436
TRANSIT NETWORK IS PART OF WHAT

00:40:05.503 --> 00:40:07.238
MAKES THAT POSSIBLE. THE

00:40:07.304 --> 00:40:09.106
PANDEMIC UPENDED OUR TRANSIT

00:40:09.173 --> 00:40:11.275
SYSTEM. AGENCIES LIKE BART,

00:40:11.342 --> 00:40:13.444
MUNI, AC TRANSIT AND CALTRAIN

00:40:13.511 --> 00:40:14.912
WERE HIT HARD AND CONTINUE TO

00:40:14.979 --> 00:40:18.048
FACE A $700 MILLION ANNUAL

00:40:18.115 --> 00:40:19.550
SHORTFALL. WITHOUT NEW FUNDING,

00:40:19.617 --> 00:40:21.685
SERVICE CUTS ARE INEVITABLE,

00:40:21.752 --> 00:40:23.454
JEOPARDIZING ACCESS TO JOBS,

00:40:23.521 --> 00:40:25.322
WORSENING CONGESTION ON STATE

00:40:25.389 --> 00:40:26.423
HIGHWAYS, AND SLOWING THE

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:29.627
REGION'S RECOVERY. SB 63 DOESN'T

00:40:29.693 --> 00:40:31.529
RAISE TAXES. IT SIMPLY GIVES THE

00:40:31.595 --> 00:40:33.564
BAY AREA PERMISSION TO ASK ITS

00:40:33.631 --> 00:40:35.366
VOTERS WHETHER THEY WANT TO

00:40:35.432 --> 00:40:37.268
INVEST IN THEIR OWN FUTURE, AND

00:40:37.334 --> 00:40:39.036
MTC HAS ADOPTED STRONG

00:40:39.103 --> 00:40:40.437
PRINCIPLES TO ENSURE THAT IF

00:40:40.504 --> 00:40:42.573
VOTERS SAY YES, THEY'LL SEE REAL

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:44.308
IMPROVEMENTS MORE AFFORDABLE,

00:40:44.375 --> 00:40:46.210
ACCESSIBLE AND EASIER TO USE

00:40:46.277 --> 00:40:47.645
SERVICES. THAT BRINGS IN NEW

00:40:47.711 --> 00:40:49.847
RIDERS. AS A REGULAR BART RIDER,

00:40:49.914 --> 00:40:51.282
I SHUDDER TO THINK WHAT THE BAY

00:40:51.348 --> 00:40:52.917

THANK YOU VERY MUCH, HONORABLE

00:43:48.659 --> 00:43:50.027
CHAIR. AND I'M HERE TO PRESENT

00:43:50.094 --> 00:43:53.063
SB 56. SB 56 ADDRESSES A

00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:55.632
CRITICAL FLAW IN THE SYSTEM THAT

00:43:55.699 --> 00:43:57.001
UNFAIRLY PENALIZES DISABLED

00:43:57.067 --> 00:43:58.335
VETERANS BY COUNTING THEIR

00:43:58.402 --> 00:44:00.204
DISABILITY BENEFITS AS INCOME

00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:02.373
WHEN DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY FOR

00:44:02.439 --> 00:44:04.108
THE DISABLED VETERANS PROPERTY

00:44:04.174 --> 00:44:06.877
TAX EXEMPTION. OVER THE PAST TWO

00:44:06.944 --> 00:44:08.212
YEARS, BOTH CALIFORNIA AND THE

00:44:08.278 --> 00:44:09.213
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE

00:44:09.279 --> 00:44:10.781
RECOGNIZED THIS ISSUE AND TAKEN

00:44:10.848 --> 00:44:12.850
STEPS TO EXCLUDE DISABILITY

00:44:12.916 --> 00:44:14.685
BENEFITS FROM HOUSEHOLD INCOME

00:44:14.752 --> 00:44:16.086
CALCULATION CALCULATIONS AND

00:44:16.153 --> 00:44:18.555
HOUSING PROGRAMS. THE PROBLEM IS

00:44:18.622 --> 00:44:21.458
THAT VETERANS MUST BE DISABLED

00:44:21.525 --> 00:44:22.459
TO QUALIFY FOR THE TAX

00:44:22.526 --> 00:44:25.029
EXEMPTION, YET THEIR DISABILITY

00:44:25.095 --> 00:44:26.130
COMPENSATION IS COUNTED AS

00:44:26.196 --> 00:44:27.498
INCOME, PUSHING THEM OVER THE

00:44:27.564 --> 00:44:30.100
INCOME THRESHOLD AND MAKING THEM

00:44:30.167 --> 00:44:31.568
INELIGIBLE. THIS CREATES AN

00:44:31.635 --> 00:44:33.737
UNFAIR CATCH 22 THAT DENIES

00:44:33.804 --> 00:44:35.105
VETERANS THE VERY SUPPORT MEANT

00:44:35.172 --> 00:44:36.907
TO HELP THEM. VETERANS ARE

00:44:36.974 --> 00:44:38.075
ENCOURAGED TO APPLY FOR

00:44:38.142 --> 00:44:39.443
DISABILITY BENEFITS, YET

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:40.944

NAME IS CHRISTINA. SHARON. I'M

00:51:06.830 --> 00:51:09.099
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR KATE

00:51:09.166 --> 00:51:11.334
FOR. AND I JUST WANT TO SAY,

00:51:11.401 --> 00:51:12.736
BECAUSE THE SENATOR GAVE A VERY

00:51:12.803 --> 00:51:14.271
GOOD PREP ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT

00:51:14.337 --> 00:51:16.773
WE DO. BUT IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:19.743
ASKED THE QUESTION, WHAT IS

00:51:19.810 --> 00:51:21.411
CALIFORNIA A BUSINESS FRIENDLY?

00:51:21.478 --> 00:51:23.680
MY PROGRAM IS THE ANSWER TO

00:51:23.747 --> 00:51:24.681
THAT. BECAUSE IF YOU'VE EVER

00:51:24.748 --> 00:51:25.816
LOOKED AROUND AND WONDERED WHO

00:51:25.882 --> 00:51:27.918
IS THE NUMBER ONE STATE, IT'S

00:51:27.984 --> 00:51:30.187
WYOMING, AND THEY HAVE A $50

00:51:30.253 --> 00:51:34.458

00:51:34.524 --> 00:51:36.126
YEARS, THEY'VE HAD FIVE YEARS OF

00:51:36.193 --> 00:51:38.762
NEGATIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH. IN

00:51:38.829 --> 00:51:40.530
THAT SAME PERIOD, CALIFORNIA HAS

00:51:40.597 --> 00:51:42.265
ONLY HAD ONE. AND IT'S BECAUSE

00:51:42.332 --> 00:51:44.501
WE HAVE A LARGE AND DIVERSE

00:51:44.568 --> 00:51:46.303
ECONOMY. AND DOING THAT IS WHAT

00:51:46.369 --> 00:51:49.639
MY PROGRAM DOES. IT ENCOURAGES

00:51:49.706 --> 00:51:50.640
MANUFACTURERS TO COME TO

00:51:50.707 --> 00:51:53.143
CALIFORNIA AND BE HERE, GROW AND

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:55.979
BRING JOBS WITH THEM. SO MY

00:51:56.046 --> 00:52:00.016
PROGRAM HAS BROUGHT IN THE LAST

00:52:00.083 --> 00:52:04.721

MANUFACTURING PROJECTS IN 40

00:52:08.758 --> 00:52:10.727
COUNTIES. THAT'S NEARLY 70% OF

00:52:10.794 --> 00:52:11.862
CALIFORNIA. AND I'M LOOKING TO

00:52:11.928 --> 00:52:13.930
MAKE THAT 100% OF CALIFORNIA

00:52:13.997 --> 00:52:16.833
EVENTUALLY. BUT IT RESULTED IN

00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:20.770
CREATING OR RETAINING 158,000

00:52:20.837 --> 00:52:22.939
283,000 JOBS. IN ADDITION, WE

00:52:23.006 --> 00:52:24.474

TAXPAYING CALIFORNIANS WHEN THEY

00:59:46.049 --> 00:59:48.251
FIND THAT FEDERAL AND STATE TAX

00:59:48.318 --> 00:59:50.887
LAWS TREAT THE SAME ISSUE IN

00:59:50.954 --> 00:59:53.456
OPPOSITE WAYS. THIS BILL IS A

00:59:53.523 --> 00:59:55.491
CONSENSUS MEASURE AND INTENDS TO

00:59:55.558 --> 00:59:57.327
IMPLEMENT TAX POLICY CHANGES

00:59:57.393 --> 00:59:59.395
THAT ARE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE

00:59:59.462 --> 01:00:01.931
AND AVOID POLICY DISPUTES. THIS

01:00:01.998 --> 01:00:03.733
BILL CONFORMS TO CHANGES MADE IN

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:06.069
THE LAST TEN YEARS THAT WERE

01:00:06.135 --> 01:00:08.504
ENACTED UNDER THREE DIFFERENT

01:00:08.571 --> 01:00:10.606
PRESIDENCIES, AND EVERY POSSIBLE

01:00:10.673 --> 01:00:13.176
COMBINATION OF UNIFIED OR SPLIT

01:00:13.242 --> 01:00:15.778
PARTIZAN CONTROL OF CONGRESS.

01:00:15.845 --> 01:00:17.280
HOWEVER, BECAUSE THIS BILL

01:00:17.347 --> 01:00:19.649
ADVANCES THE STATE'S TAX

01:00:19.716 --> 01:00:22.118
CONFORMITY DATE TO JANUARY 1ST,

01:00:22.185 --> 01:00:24.387
2025, IT DOES NOT CONFORM TO ANY

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:26.456
CHANGES MADE FROM FEDERAL BILL

01:00:26.522 --> 01:00:29.792
RECENTLY ENACTED BY CONGRESS. I

01:00:29.859 --> 01:00:31.894
HAVE WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN

01:00:31.961 --> 01:00:33.696
SUPPORT ONE OF THE LEADING

MATTERS OF CONFORMITY IS

01:00:42.338 --> 01:00:44.474
ABSOLUTELY UNMATCHED. I ALSO

ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. AND

01:01:02.225 --> 01:01:04.961
WITH THAT, I WILL TURN IT OVER

HERE IN SACRAMENTO. SENATOR

01:01:18.041 --> 01:01:19.308
MCNERNEY INVITED ME TO SPEAK

01:01:19.375 --> 01:01:20.610
TODAY BECAUSE I LIKELY HAVE

01:01:20.676 --> 01:01:22.645
WORKED ON MORE OMNIBUS FEDERAL

01:01:22.712 --> 01:01:23.746
CONFORMITY BILLS THAN ANYONE

01:01:23.813 --> 01:01:26.949
ELSE IN THE STATE, INCLUDING

01:01:27.016 --> 01:01:28.751
1987 AB 53. JULIA MAY HAVE BEEN

01:01:28.818 --> 01:01:31.888
THERE, TOO, 19 1987. THAT

01:01:31.954 --> 01:01:34.157
LEGISLATION CONFORMED TO FEDERAL

01:01:34.223 --> 01:01:37.560
LAW BY PRESIDENT REAGAN'S

01:01:37.627 --> 01:01:40.563
SWEEPING TAX REFORM ACT OF 1986,

01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:41.697
WHICH WAS DRIVEN BY THE

01:01:41.764 --> 01:01:43.433
PRINCIPLES OF FAIRNESS,

01:01:43.499 --> 01:01:45.034
EFFICIENCY, SIMPLICITY, AND

01:01:45.101 --> 01:01:47.537
REVENUE NEUTRALITY. AB 53 MARKED

01:01:47.603 --> 01:01:49.338
A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT IN

01:01:49.405 --> 01:01:50.740
CALIFORNIA'S TAX STRUCTURE. IT

01:01:50.807 --> 01:01:52.608
MOVED THE STATE AWAY FROM A

01:01:52.675 --> 01:01:54.010
STANDALONE PERSONAL INCOME TAX

01:01:54.077 --> 01:01:57.246
RETURN, WHICH, WHEN WE HAD TO

01:01:57.313 --> 01:01:58.347
RECONSTRUCT THE FEDERAL RETURN

01:01:58.414 --> 01:02:00.416
FROM SCRATCH TO ONE THAT BEGINS

01:02:00.483 --> 01:02:02.118
WITH FEDERAL AGI. AND THAT'S

01:02:02.185 --> 01:02:03.252
WHERE WE ARE TODAY, BEGINNING

01:02:03.319 --> 01:02:05.388
WITH FEDERAL AGI, THIS ALIGNMENT

01:02:05.455 --> 01:02:07.590
REPRESENTED A MAJOR STEP TOWARD

01:02:07.657 --> 01:02:08.624
SIMPLIFICATION AND CONSISTENCY

01:02:08.691 --> 01:02:10.493
BETWEEN FEDERAL AND STATE TAX

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:13.496
SYSTEMS. WHEN ADDRESSING FEDERAL

01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:14.764
CONFORMITY. THERE ARE THERE'S A

01:02:14.831 --> 01:02:16.232
GENERAL METHODOLOGY THAT APPLIES

01:02:16.299 --> 01:02:18.401
ACROSS THE STATES. SOME STATES

01:02:18.468 --> 01:02:19.902
USE ROLLING CONFORMITY, MEANING

01:02:19.969 --> 01:02:22.438
THE STATE AUTOMATICALLY CONFORMS

01:02:22.505 --> 01:02:24.273
TO NEW AND AMENDED FEDERAL

01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:26.742
PROVISIONS. SOME USE STATIC

01:02:26.809 --> 01:02:28.578
CONFORMITY. WE CALL THAT ALSO

01:02:28.644 --> 01:02:29.712
FIXED STATE CONFORMITY, MEANING

01:02:29.779 --> 01:02:31.047
THE STATES CONFORM TO FEDERAL

01:02:31.114 --> 01:02:32.915
LAW AS OF A CERTAIN DATE, AND

01:02:32.982 --> 01:02:34.717
THAT TAKES DELIBERATIVE

01:02:34.784 --> 01:02:36.552
LEGISLATIVE ACTION. AND FINALLY,

01:02:36.619 --> 01:02:38.621
SOME STATES USE SELECTIVE

01:02:38.688 --> 01:02:39.989
CONFORMITY, WHERE SPECIFIC

01:02:40.056 --> 01:02:41.424
FEDERAL PROVISIONS ARE ENACTED

01:02:41.491 --> 01:02:43.960
INTO STATE LAW. CALIFORNIA USES

01:02:44.026 --> 01:02:45.728
A COMBINATION OF STATIC AND

01:02:45.795 --> 01:02:48.231
SELECTIVE CONFORMITY, AND WE USE

01:02:48.297 --> 01:02:50.500
STATIC CONFORMITY BY WAY OF A

01:02:50.566 --> 01:02:52.735
SPECIFIED DATE, WHICH I WILL

01:02:52.802 --> 01:02:54.437
EXPLAIN IN A MINUTE. BUT THE

01:02:54.504 --> 01:02:55.838
LEGISLATURE ALSO USES A

01:02:55.905 --> 01:02:57.673
SELECTIVE CONFORMITY OR

01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:59.242
NON-CONFORMITY, SPECIFICALLY

01:02:59.308 --> 01:03:00.977
CONFORMING OR DECOUPLING TO A

01:03:01.043 --> 01:03:02.778
SPECIFIC FEDERAL PROVISION. FOR

01:03:02.845 --> 01:03:05.248
EXAMPLE, CALIFORNIA HAS NEVER

01:03:05.314 --> 01:03:06.616
CONFORMED TO HEALTH SAVINGS

01:03:06.682 --> 01:03:09.719
ACCOUNTS OR HSAS. PRIOR TO 1983,

01:03:09.785 --> 01:03:11.020
THE CALIFORNIA INCOME AND

01:03:11.087 --> 01:03:12.788
FRANCHISE TAX LAWS WERE STAND

01:03:12.855 --> 01:03:14.157
ALONE. WE DID NOT

01:03:14.223 --> 01:03:14.957
CROSS-REFERENCE FEDERAL

01:03:15.024 --> 01:03:17.126
PROVISIONS, BUT WE COPIED WHOLE

01:03:17.193 --> 01:03:19.095
SECTIONS INTO OUR LAW. AND THEN

01:03:19.162 --> 01:03:20.763
IN THE LATE 80S, AND IF YOU'LL

01:03:20.830 --> 01:03:22.098
REFERENCE THE CHART, I PASSED

01:03:22.165 --> 01:03:24.567
OUT IN THE LATE 80S AND 90S,

01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:26.068
CALIFORNIA ENACTED CONFORMITY

01:03:26.135 --> 01:03:28.604
LEGISLATION NEARLY EVERY YEAR.

01:03:28.671 --> 01:03:30.873
BUT BY THE LATE 90S AND 2000,

01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:33.476
GENERAL DATE CHANGE CONFORMITY

01:03:33.543 --> 01:03:35.244
BECAME LESS FREQUENT AND THE

01:03:35.311 --> 01:03:37.713
LEGISLATURE MISSED 94 THROUGH

01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:40.249
9699 THROUGH 2000, 2002, AND ON

01:03:40.316 --> 01:03:41.450
AND ON. AND WE WENT DOWNHILL

01:03:41.517 --> 01:03:42.785
FROM THERE. BASICALLY, WE ARE

01:03:42.852 --> 01:03:45.521
NOW TEN YEARS BEHIND. IN

01:03:45.588 --> 01:03:46.822
PRACTICAL TERMS, WHAT THAT MEANS

01:03:46.889 --> 01:03:48.424
IS AND AGAIN, IF YOU COULD

01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:49.992
REFERENCE THE CHART, FOR

01:03:50.059 --> 01:03:51.327
EXAMPLE, IF YOU'RE UNDER AUDIT

01:03:51.394 --> 01:03:53.529
FOR THE 2014 TAX YEAR AND THERE

01:03:53.596 --> 01:03:54.530
ARE TAXPAYERS UNDER AUDIT FOR

01:03:54.597 --> 01:03:56.399
THAT YEAR, YOU NEED TO USE

01:03:56.465 --> 01:03:58.668
FEDERAL LAW, AS IT READ JANUARY

01:03:58.734 --> 01:04:01.304
1ST, 2009. THIS IS JUST

01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:02.939
RIDICULOUS, A RIDICULOUS SYSTEM

01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:05.007
WE NEED TO UPDATE UPDATE OUR

01:04:05.074 --> 01:04:06.409
SPECIFIED DATE. IF YOU ARE

01:04:06.475 --> 01:04:08.177
PREPARING A 2024 RETURN, YOU

01:04:08.244 --> 01:04:10.046
NEED TO USE FEDERAL LAW AS IT

01:04:10.112 --> 01:04:13.015
READ JANUARY 1ST, 2015. SO WE'VE

01:04:13.082 --> 01:04:14.617
GOT TO GO TEN YEARS BACK JUST TO

01:04:14.684 --> 01:04:16.485
PREPARE THE 24 RETURN. THAT'S

01:04:16.552 --> 01:04:18.287
WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO UPDATE,

01:04:18.354 --> 01:04:20.456
AS SENATOR MCNERNEY'S BILL DOES

01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:23.092
FROM JANUARY 1ST, 2015 TO

01:04:23.159 --> 01:04:26.596
JANUARY 1ST, 2025. WHY CONFORM

01:04:26.662 --> 01:04:27.496
SIMPLIFICATION, SIMPLIFICATION

01:04:27.563 --> 01:04:29.131
ALL THE WAY AROUND FOR

01:04:29.198 --> 01:04:30.600
TAXPAYERS? FOR THE TAX

01:04:30.666 --> 01:04:32.134
ADMINISTRATORS, IT REDUCES THEIR

01:04:32.201 --> 01:04:34.136
THEIR COSTS OF ADMINISTERING

01:04:34.203 --> 01:04:36.372
SUCH COMPLEX LAWS. IT EASES THE

01:04:36.439 --> 01:04:39.141
BURDEN THEY THE FEDERAL THE

01:04:39.208 --> 01:04:40.676
FRANCHISE TAX BOARD CAN RELY ON

01:04:40.743 --> 01:04:43.546
FEDERAL LAW, CAN RELY ON FEDERAL

01:04:43.613 --> 01:04:45.748
AUDITS. THEY CAN RELY ON FEDERAL

01:04:45.815 --> 01:04:47.883
CASE LAW AND REGULATIONS. I

01:04:47.950 --> 01:04:49.652
APPLAUD SENATOR MCNERNEY AND

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:51.621

CHAIR. ESTEEMED MEMBERS OF THE

COMMITTEE AND VERY CAPABLE

01:10:25.921 --> 01:10:29.792
STAFF. SB 328 IS A BILL THAT

01:10:29.858 --> 01:10:31.694
WOULD PREVENT SIGNIFICANT COST

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:32.595
INCREASES FOR HOUSING DEVELOPERS

01:10:32.661 --> 01:10:34.897
WHO HAVE REMEDIATED CONTAMINATED

01:10:34.964 --> 01:10:37.766
SOIL AND RETURNED LAND TO

01:10:37.833 --> 01:10:40.202
PRODUCTIVE USE. IN 2022, THE

01:10:40.269 --> 01:10:42.671
LEGISLATURE PASSED SB 158, A

01:10:42.738 --> 01:10:44.573
BUDGET TRAILER BILL THAT HAD THE

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:46.041
GOAL OF STABILIZING THE BUDGET

01:10:46.108 --> 01:10:48.344
FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC

01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:49.578
SUBSTANCE CONTROL, OR WE KNOW IT

01:10:49.645 --> 01:10:52.481
AS DTSC. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE

01:10:52.548 --> 01:10:55.184
THIS, SB 158 MADE CHANGES TO ONE

01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:57.186
OF THE MAJOR FEES THAT ARE PAID

01:10:57.252 --> 01:10:59.822
TO DTSC WHEN REMEDIATING A SITE.

01:10:59.888 --> 01:11:02.558
BEFORE SB 158, DTSC USED A

01:11:02.625 --> 01:11:04.727
TIERED MODEL WITH A FEE THAT

01:11:04.793 --> 01:11:06.462
RANGED DEPENDING ON THE PROJECT.

01:11:06.528 --> 01:11:08.731
THE FEES WERE ALSO CAPPED AT

01:11:08.797 --> 01:11:10.432
$100,000 FOR MOST HOUSING

01:11:10.499 --> 01:11:12.267
PROJECTS. HOWEVER, THIS MODEL

01:11:12.334 --> 01:11:14.470
WAS REPLACED WITH A FIXED PRICE

01:11:14.536 --> 01:11:19.008
PER TON MODEL OF $46.20 PER TON.

01:11:19.074 --> 01:11:20.209
THESE CHANGES TO THE HAZARDOUS

01:11:20.275 --> 01:11:22.845
WASTE GENERATOR FEE HAVE HAD A

01:11:22.911 --> 01:11:24.179
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON

01:11:24.246 --> 01:11:25.314
DEVELOPMENT, AND HAVE INCREASED

01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:26.615
COSTS FOR SEVERAL ESSENTIAL

01:11:26.682 --> 01:11:28.651
HOUSING PROJECTS AND PROJECTS

01:11:28.717 --> 01:11:30.352
THAT PROVIDE COMMUNITY

01:11:30.419 --> 01:11:33.122
DEVELOPMENT. THIS FEE

01:11:33.188 --> 01:11:34.323
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE COST

01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:36.759
OF REMEDIATING CONTAMINATED SOIL

01:11:36.825 --> 01:11:38.994
IN URBAN INFILL SITES, OR IN

01:11:39.061 --> 01:11:40.396
SITUATIONS WHERE DEVELOPERS

01:11:40.462 --> 01:11:42.197
ENCOUNTERED NATURALLY OCCURRING

01:11:42.264 --> 01:11:44.733
TOXIC MATERIALS. FOR INSTANCE, A

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:46.568
HOUSING PROJECT IN SAN FRANCISCO

01:11:46.635 --> 01:11:52.274
SAW THEIR FEES RISE FROM

01:11:52.341 --> 01:11:53.208
$100,000 TO $800,000. THE

01:11:53.275 --> 01:11:54.810
INCREASED FEE WAS HAS MADE

01:11:54.877 --> 01:11:56.679
SEVERAL PROJECTS INFEASIBLE. AT

01:11:56.745 --> 01:11:58.347
A TIME WHERE CALIFORNIA IS

01:11:58.414 --> 01:12:00.549
ALREADY STRUGGLING WITH RISING

01:12:00.616 --> 01:12:02.317
COSTS TO HELP PROVIDE RELIEF AND

01:12:02.384 --> 01:12:04.219
REDUCE COSTS FOR THESE IMPORTANT

01:12:04.286 --> 01:12:07.456
ESSENTIAL HOUSING PROJECTS, SB

01:12:07.523 --> 01:12:09.558
328 WOULD ESTABLISH A CAP ON

01:12:09.625 --> 01:12:12.361
HAZARDOUS WASTE GENERATOR FEE AT

01:12:12.428 --> 01:12:14.630
$100,000 PER PROJECT, PER YEAR

01:12:14.697 --> 01:12:17.199
FOR INFILL PROJECTS, AND 250,000

01:12:17.266 --> 01:12:19.635
PER PROJECT PER YEAR FOR MASTER

01:12:19.702 --> 01:12:21.103
DEVELOPED PROJECTS. THIS BILL

01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:23.539
WOULD ALSO PLACE TIMELINES ON

01:12:23.605 --> 01:12:25.140
DTSC FOR RESPONDING TO

01:12:25.207 --> 01:12:27.009
DEVELOPMENT RELATED ACTIONS TO

01:12:27.076 --> 01:12:28.577
HELP PREVENT DELAYS IN THE

01:12:28.644 --> 01:12:30.279
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. AT A TIME

01:12:30.345 --> 01:12:31.947
WHERE CALIFORNIA IS FACING

01:12:32.014 --> 01:12:33.649
INCREASED DEVELOPMENT COSTS, WE

01:12:33.716 --> 01:12:35.851
MUST DO WHAT WE CAN TO CREATE A

01:12:35.918 --> 01:12:38.654
MORE FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT THAT

01:12:38.721 --> 01:12:40.489
ALLOWS US TO BUILD HOUSING

01:12:40.556 --> 01:12:41.857
THAT'S AFFORDABLE. BUILDERS WHO

01:12:41.924 --> 01:12:45.060
ARE REPURPOSING THE LAND

01:12:45.127 --> 01:12:47.196
PRODUCTIVE USE SHOULD NOT BE

01:12:47.262 --> 01:12:48.997
PENALIZED, ESPECIALLY THOSE

01:12:49.064 --> 01:12:50.866
REMEDIATING POLLUTION RATHER

01:12:50.933 --> 01:12:53.802
THAN CAUSING IT. SB 328 WOULD

01:12:53.869 --> 01:12:55.437
PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED RELIEF AT A

01:12:55.504 --> 01:12:58.340
TIME WHERE COSTS ARE CONSTANTLY

01:12:58.407 --> 01:12:59.708
INCREASING. I DO HAVE WITNESSES

01:12:59.775 --> 01:13:01.343
WITH ME THROUGH THE CHAIR. I

01:13:01.410 --> 01:13:02.678
WOULD HAVE THEM INTRODUCE. THANK

01:13:02.745 --> 01:13:04.146

01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:05.948

AREA COUNCIL HERE IN SUPPORT.

01:13:09.985 --> 01:13:11.420
THANKS FOR HEARING US OUT. THE

01:13:11.487 --> 01:13:12.888
BAY AREA COUNCIL REPRESENTS

01:13:12.955 --> 01:13:13.856
ABOUT 350 OF THE REGION'S

01:13:13.922 --> 01:13:15.557
LARGEST EMPLOYERS. WE'VE WORKED

01:13:15.624 --> 01:13:17.092
ON HOUSING AND RELATED ISSUES

01:13:17.159 --> 01:13:19.027
FOR OVER 80 YEARS. THIS BILL

01:13:19.094 --> 01:13:20.696
WOULD HELP US BUILD MORE INFILL

01:13:20.763 --> 01:13:21.964
HOUSING AND LEAD TO CLEANING UP

01:13:22.030 --> 01:13:24.032
MORE POLLUTION BY CAPPING THE

01:13:24.099 --> 01:13:24.933
GENERATION AND HANDLING FEE

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.769
CHARGED BY DTSC FOR RESIDENTIAL

01:13:26.835 --> 01:13:28.203
INFILL HOUSING AND MASTER

01:13:28.270 --> 01:13:30.539
DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. IN 2021,

01:13:30.606 --> 01:13:31.774
WHEN THE LEGISLATURE REMOVED THE

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:34.109
CAP ON THIS FEE, THERE WAS AN

01:13:34.176 --> 01:13:35.477
UNEXPECTED, UNEXPECTEDLY LARGE

01:13:35.544 --> 01:13:37.579
FEE INCREASE FOR MANY INFILL

01:13:37.646 --> 01:13:39.114
HOUSING PROJECTS. AS SENATOR

01:13:39.181 --> 01:13:40.516
GRAYSON MENTIONED, MANY OF THOSE

01:13:40.582 --> 01:13:43.051
FEES WENT FROM $100,000 A YEAR

01:13:43.118 --> 01:13:44.887
TO $800,000 A YEAR. IN SOME

01:13:44.953 --> 01:13:45.888
CASES, DEVELOPERS HAD TO PAY THE

01:13:45.954 --> 01:13:48.090
FEE TWICE, STOPPING PROJECTS IN

01:13:48.157 --> 01:13:50.692
THEIR TRACKS. TO BE CLEAR, THESE

01:13:50.759 --> 01:13:52.027
PROJECTS HAVE IN THE PAST PAID

01:13:52.094 --> 01:13:53.495
FOR THE REMEDIATION OF ANY SOIL

01:13:53.562 --> 01:13:55.697
THEY EXCAVATED, AND THEY WILL DO

01:13:55.764 --> 01:13:58.500
SO UNDER THE BILL. TODAY, THE

01:13:58.567 --> 01:13:59.601
GENERATION AND HANDLING FEE IS

01:13:59.668 --> 01:14:01.837
JUST FOR DTSC TO MONITOR AND

01:14:01.904 --> 01:14:03.872
VERIFY THAT THE CLEANUP IS BEING

01:14:03.939 --> 01:14:06.008
DONE. WE WORRY THAT AN UNCAPPED

01:14:06.074 --> 01:14:07.643
FEE WILL PUSH HOUSING AWAY FROM

01:14:07.709 --> 01:14:09.645
OUR URBAN AREAS AND CAUSE LESS

01:14:09.711 --> 01:14:11.547
SOIL REMEDIATION TO OCCUR,

01:14:11.613 --> 01:14:12.781
LEAVING COMMUNITIES POLLUTED.

01:14:12.848 --> 01:14:14.683
THE BILL ALSO APPLIES KEY

01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:15.584
PRINCIPLES FROM THE STATE'S

01:14:15.651 --> 01:14:17.286
PERMIT STREAMLINING ACT TO THE

01:14:17.352 --> 01:14:18.821
CLEANUP REVIEW PROCESS, IN WAYS

01:14:18.887 --> 01:14:20.622
THAT WILL MAKE CLEANING UP THAT

01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:21.690
LAND EASIER TO DO. THE BILL

01:14:21.757 --> 01:14:24.159
WOULD, FOR EXAMPLE, REQUIRE DTSC

01:14:24.226 --> 01:14:25.828
TO REVIEW AND PROVIDE INITIAL

01:14:25.894 --> 01:14:27.329
RESPONSE TO CLEANUP PLANS WITHIN

01:14:27.396 --> 01:14:29.865
60 DAYS OR 120 DAYS, DEPENDING

01:14:29.932 --> 01:14:32.034
ON THE SIZE OF THE PROJECT. DTSC

01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:33.535
WOULD INCLUDE IN THIS RESPONSE

01:14:33.602 --> 01:14:35.170
THEIR REQUEST FOR ANY ADDITIONAL

01:14:35.237 --> 01:14:36.705
INFORMATION OR RELEVANT

01:14:36.772 --> 01:14:38.040
TIMELINES THAT THE PROJECT MUST

01:14:38.106 --> 01:14:39.908
ABIDE. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE

01:14:39.975 --> 01:14:41.310
CHANGES STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE

01:14:41.376 --> 01:14:42.945
BETWEEN ALLOWING DTSC TO COVER

01:14:43.011 --> 01:14:44.980
THE COSTS OF THEIR ESSENTIAL

01:14:45.047 --> 01:14:46.348
WORK, WHILE ALLOWING IMPORTANT

WITH CERTAINTY AND AT A

01:14:49.318 --> 01:14:50.385
REASONABLE COST. FOR THESE

01:14:50.452 --> 01:14:51.520
REASONS, THE BAY AREA COUNCIL IS

01:14:51.587 --> 01:14:54.056

SEVERAL CLEAN ENERGY INVESTMENT

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:32.661

THESE INCENTIVES. CLEAN ENERGY

01:21:00.855 --> 01:21:01.890
PROJECTS IN CALIFORNIA WILL COST

01:21:01.957 --> 01:21:04.793
MORE TO BUILD, LEADING TO HIGHER

01:21:04.859 --> 01:21:07.195
RATEPAYER COSTS. SB 302 WOULD

01:21:07.262 --> 01:21:08.630
BRING CALIFORNIA TAX CODE INTO

CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES TO UTILIZE

01:21:16.504 --> 01:21:18.473
THE INCENTIVES LAID OUT IN THE

01:22:30.945 --> 01:22:33.315
THE THREE LEGGED STOOL, OUR OWN

01:22:33.381 --> 01:22:36.151
CAPITAL. WE TRUSTED FINANCIAL

01:22:36.217 --> 01:22:37.652
INSTITUTIONS WHO HAVE LENT MONEY

01:22:37.719 --> 01:22:40.121
TO US ALL THE WAY BACK TO FIRST

01:22:40.188 --> 01:22:43.024
PROJECT IN YUBA CITY IN 1990,

01:22:43.091 --> 01:22:44.392
AND THE FEDERAL ENERGY TAX

01:22:44.459 --> 01:22:46.695
CREDIT. THE ENERGY TAX CREDIT IS

01:22:46.761 --> 01:22:50.932
JUST ABSOLUTELY KEY TO THIS

01:22:50.999 --> 01:22:53.134
ENTIRE FINANCING STRUCTURE. AND

01:22:53.201 --> 01:22:55.036
ONE OF THOSE LEGS DISAPPEARS OR

01:22:55.103 --> 01:22:56.771
GETS HIT BADLY. THE PROJECTS

01:22:56.838 --> 01:22:59.207
REALLY DON'T WORK. PROJECTS ARE

01:22:59.274 --> 01:23:01.309
REAL. THEY'LL GET BUILT. BUT

01:23:01.376 --> 01:23:02.744
REALLY CRITICAL. IS THE

01:23:02.811 --> 01:23:05.013
CONFORMITY ISSUE. CONFORMING

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:06.114
CALIFORNIA TAX LAW TO THE

01:23:06.181 --> 01:23:09.651
FEDERAL TAX LAW? SO WE'VE BUILT

01:23:09.718 --> 01:23:12.153
STUFF ON BUDGET, ON TIME, LOCAL

01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:13.655
HIRES, HIGHLY SKILLED ENGINEERS,

01:23:13.722 --> 01:23:15.857
UNION LABOR, GOT A GOOD

01:23:15.924 --> 01:23:17.926
REPUTATION. I WANT TO UNDERSCORE

01:23:17.992 --> 01:23:18.993
THREE POINTS. THIS IS A FEDERAL

01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:21.229
TAX CREDIT. THIS IS NOT A STATE

01:23:21.296 --> 01:23:24.366
TAX GIVEAWAY. CALIFORNIA IS

01:23:24.432 --> 01:23:27.235
BEHIND. EVERY OTHER STATE HAS

01:23:27.302 --> 01:23:29.671
REACHED THE CONFORMITY SITUATION

01:23:29.738 --> 01:23:31.773
WITH THE FEDERAL TAX LAW. EVERY

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:34.509
OTHER STATE NONCONFORMITY AND

01:23:34.576 --> 01:23:36.611
THIS IS A REALLY BIG DEAL, IS

01:23:36.678 --> 01:23:40.482
BAD FOR AFFORDABILITY BECAUSE

01:23:40.548 --> 01:23:43.151
WHAT WILL HAPPEN HERE IS IF THIS

01:23:43.218 --> 01:23:45.286
GETS INCLUDED IN THE COST OF

01:23:45.353 --> 01:23:47.122
BUILDING IN CALIFORNIA, THOSE

01:23:47.188 --> 01:23:50.392
TAX ULTIMATELY GET PASSED ON TO

01:23:50.458 --> 01:23:51.926
RATEPAYERS. SO IN SHORT, WE

01:23:51.993 --> 01:23:53.995
THINK THIS IS A COMMON SENSE PRO

01:23:54.062 --> 01:23:56.097
CLIMATE PRO AFFORDABILITY BILL.

01:23:56.164 --> 01:23:58.633
AND WE REQUEST RESPECTFULLY

01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:01.102
REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT IN AN AYE

01:24:01.169 --> 01:24:03.638

THE TAX CONFORMITY LAWS IN MY

01:24:15.917 --> 01:24:18.086

01:24:18.153 --> 01:24:19.187

TO ME HERE TO TALK ABOUT, I

01:24:23.458 --> 01:24:27.162
WANTED TO JUST TOUCH ON THE NEED

01:24:27.228 --> 01:24:28.897
FOR THESE, FOR THIS BILL AND FOR

01:24:28.963 --> 01:24:30.265
THIS HISTORIC INVESTMENT THAT

01:24:30.331 --> 01:24:32.133
CAME OUT OF THE PREVIOUS

01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:32.867
ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON,

01:24:32.934 --> 01:24:36.971
DC. WE, AS YOU ALL KNOW, FIGHT

01:24:37.038 --> 01:24:40.775
VERY HARD FOR OUR MEMBERS, OUR

01:24:40.842 --> 01:24:41.576
THOUSANDS OF MEMBERS WHO WORK IN

01:24:41.643 --> 01:24:42.444
THE TRADITIONAL ENERGY SECTOR IN

01:24:42.510 --> 01:24:45.513
THIS STATE. HOWEVER, PROJECTS

01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:47.282
SUCH AS WELLHEADS PROJECTS,

01:24:47.348 --> 01:24:49.684
ENERGY STORAGE PROJECTS, OUR

01:24:49.751 --> 01:24:52.120
MEMBERS ARE TRAINED TO BUILD

01:24:52.187 --> 01:24:54.489
THOSE PROJECTS AS WELL. WE'VE

01:24:54.556 --> 01:24:57.992
BUILT THE VAST MAJORITY OF GREEN

01:24:58.059 --> 01:24:59.861
PROJECTS, WHETHER IT BE STORAGE,

WHETHER IT BE GEOTHERMAL, PUMPED

01:25:06.701 --> 01:25:09.237
LAST 20 YEARS, WE STAND READY TO

01:25:09.304 --> 01:25:11.673
BUILD THESE PROJECTS AS WELL.

01:25:11.739 --> 01:25:13.842
THESE CREDITS AND THIS TAX

01:25:13.908 --> 01:25:15.610
CONFORMITY ARE SO CRITICAL TO

01:25:15.677 --> 01:25:17.212
GET SOME OF THESE PROJECTS OFF

01:25:17.278 --> 01:25:18.646
THE GROUND, MANY OF THESE

01:25:18.713 --> 01:25:19.981
PROJECTS OFF THE GROUND, AND TO

01:25:20.048 --> 01:25:22.951
GIVE CALIFORNIANS, MEN AND WOMEN

01:25:23.017 --> 01:25:24.319

01:25:25.553 --> 01:25:26.421
STATE APPROVED APPRENTICESHIP

TO DO TO BECOME A JOURNEY PERSON

01:25:37.131 --> 01:25:39.734
IN THEIR RESPECTIVE TRADE. SO

01:25:39.801 --> 01:25:42.003
THIS TAX CONFORMITY SEEMS VERY

01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:44.138
COMMON SENSE, VERY SIMPLE TO

01:25:44.205 --> 01:25:45.540
UNDERSTAND. WE'RE THE ONLY STATE

01:25:45.607 --> 01:25:47.008
THAT HASN'T DONE IT YET, BUT

01:25:47.075 --> 01:25:48.443
JUST THIS SMALL CHANGE IS GOING

01:25:48.510 --> 01:25:50.478
TO MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN

01:25:50.545 --> 01:25:52.180
GETTING A LOT OF THESE PROJECTS

01:25:52.247 --> 01:25:53.515
OFF THE GROUND. AND IT'S GOING

01:25:53.581 --> 01:25:56.150
TO BE ABLE TO PUT A LOT OF OUR

01:25:56.217 --> 01:25:56.985
MEMBERS TO WORK, AND ESPECIALLY

01:25:57.051 --> 01:25:58.186
AS THE STATE TRANSITIONS, YOU

01:25:58.253 --> 01:25:59.554

01:25:59.621 --> 01:26:01.422
THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS TO GET

01:26:01.489 --> 01:26:03.525
OFF THE GROUND AND GET GOING. SO

01:26:03.591 --> 01:26:04.726

01:42:10.457 --> 01:42:12.659
VETERANS WHO EITHER OWN A HOME

01:42:12.726 --> 01:42:14.361
OR ARE LOOKING TO PURCHASE THE

01:42:14.428 --> 01:42:17.231
VERY FIRST HOME IN CALIFORNIA.

01:42:17.297 --> 01:42:18.499
VETERANS FROM ACROSS THE NATION

01:42:18.565 --> 01:42:20.934
AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE

01:42:21.001 --> 01:42:22.269
SHOWN THEIR SUPPORT FOR THIS

01:42:22.336 --> 01:42:24.771
PARTICULAR BILL, RECOGNIZING THE

01:42:24.838 --> 01:42:26.974
POSITIVE ECONOMIC IMPACT IT WILL

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:29.042
HAVE ON THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR

01:42:29.109 --> 01:42:31.612
FAMILIES IN THE FUTURE. THE

01:42:31.678 --> 01:42:34.147
VETERANS ELIGIBLE FOR THIS

01:42:34.214 --> 01:42:36.116
PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION SERVED

01:42:36.183 --> 01:42:37.985
OUR COUNTRY WITH HONOR AND IN

01:42:38.051 --> 01:42:42.222
MANY CASES, WHO GAVE UP PARTS OF

01:42:42.289 --> 01:42:45.292
THEIR BODY MENTALLY, PHYSICALLY,

01:42:45.359 --> 01:42:47.427
AND WHETHER IT BE IN COMBAT,

01:42:47.494 --> 01:42:49.663
WHETHER IT WAS LITERALLY FALLING

01:42:49.730 --> 01:42:51.431
OUT OF AN AIRPLANE, A TRUCK OR A

01:42:51.498 --> 01:42:53.567
JEEP OR WHATEVER IT WAS, BROKE

01:42:53.634 --> 01:42:55.435
THEIR BACKS AND WERE NO LONGER

01:42:55.502 --> 01:42:59.339
ABLE TO WALK OR WORK AND BECAME

01:42:59.406 --> 01:43:02.509
100% DISABLED. HOUSING

01:43:02.576 --> 01:43:03.944
AFFORDABILITY REMAINS A

01:43:04.011 --> 01:43:05.612
SIGNIFICANT CONCERN FOR

01:43:05.679 --> 01:43:07.581
VETERANS, WITH NEARLY 35% OF

01:43:07.648 --> 01:43:10.217
VETERANS PAYING MORE THAN 30% OF

01:43:10.284 --> 01:43:13.053
THEIR INCOME FOR HOUSING.

01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:14.855
HOUSING IS AN ISSUE HERE IN

01:43:14.922 --> 01:43:16.890
CALIFORNIA THAT ADDRESSES

01:43:16.957 --> 01:43:20.160
VETERANS AND CIVILIANS ALIKE.

01:43:20.227 --> 01:43:22.663
DISABLED VETERANS IS THIS BILL.

01:43:22.729 --> 01:43:24.998
DISABLED VETERANS ARE EAGER TO

01:43:25.065 --> 01:43:27.067
RESIDE IN THE STATE, YET THE

01:43:27.134 --> 01:43:28.402
PREVAILING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

01:43:28.468 --> 01:43:30.370
ARE CREATING SIGNIFICANT

01:43:30.437 --> 01:43:32.506
FINANCIAL STRAINS FOR THEM. SO

01:43:32.573 --> 01:43:34.641
IMAGINE BY HAVING A TAX RELIEF,

01:43:34.708 --> 01:43:35.876
WHAT THAT WILL DO TO OUR

01:43:35.943 --> 01:43:38.245
VETERANS. SENATE BILL 296

01:43:38.312 --> 01:43:39.646
PROVIDES A PROPERTY TAX

01:43:39.713 --> 01:43:42.583
EXEMPTION FOR 100% DISABLED

01:43:42.649 --> 01:43:43.951
VETERANS. LET ME POINT THAT

01:43:44.017 --> 01:43:47.187
AGAIN, 100% DISABLED VETERANS,

01:43:47.254 --> 01:43:49.356
THAT WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF

01:43:49.423 --> 01:43:51.558
VETERANS WHO REALLY OWN A

01:43:51.625 --> 01:43:53.460
PROPERTY AND HAVE OWNED IT FOR A

01:43:53.527 --> 01:43:55.495
CONSIDERABLE LONG TIME, BUT

01:43:55.562 --> 01:43:57.431
THOSE THAT DO THAT EXEMPTION

01:43:57.497 --> 01:43:59.433
WOULD REALLY HELP THE VETERANS

01:43:59.499 --> 01:44:01.902
WHO MAYBE NOW WITH THE VA

01:44:01.969 --> 01:44:04.237
HELPING WITH WHEELCHAIR ACCESS,

01:44:04.304 --> 01:44:05.472
WILL NOW BE ABLE TO BUY THAT

01:44:05.539 --> 01:44:07.407
HOME. SO IT'S REALLY GOING TO

01:44:07.474 --> 01:44:10.577
OPEN DOORS. THIS INCLUDES

01:44:10.644 --> 01:44:12.012
VETERANS WHO HAVE EITHER HAVE

01:44:12.079 --> 01:44:15.482
THAT 100% RATING FROM THE VA,

01:44:15.549 --> 01:44:16.984
AND SOME OF THOSE RATINGS

01:44:17.050 --> 01:44:19.186
CONSIST OF VETERANS WHO ARE

01:44:19.252 --> 01:44:21.054
BLIND IN BOTH EYES WHO HAVE LOST

01:44:21.121 --> 01:44:23.624
TWO OR MORE LIMBS. THIS BILL

01:44:23.690 --> 01:44:25.492
ALSO OFFERS TAX EXEMPTIONS TO

01:44:25.559 --> 01:44:27.527
THE UNMARRIED SURVIVING SPOUSE

01:44:27.594 --> 01:44:29.563
OF A QUALIFYING DECEASED

01:44:29.630 --> 01:44:31.965
VETERAN, WHICH IS VERY, VERY

01:44:32.032 --> 01:44:33.333
IMPORTANT. AND WITH CALVERT, I

01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:35.168
DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS, BUT

01:44:35.235 --> 01:44:39.006
CALVERT NOW HAS A PROGRAM THAT

01:44:39.072 --> 01:44:41.675
VETERANS WHO HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE

01:44:41.742 --> 01:44:43.844
IN THEIR FAMILY, THEIR THEIR

01:44:43.910 --> 01:44:45.612
DAUGHTERS AND SONS CAN GO ON AND

01:44:45.679 --> 01:44:47.280
GET A FULL EDUCATION WITH OUR

01:44:47.347 --> 01:44:49.616
CAL STATE SCHOOLS BECAUSE OF

01:44:49.683 --> 01:44:51.351
CALVERT. AND THAT IS FOR ALL

01:44:51.418 --> 01:44:52.753
VETERANS, NOT JUST DISABLED. SO

01:44:52.819 --> 01:44:55.255
I THINK CALIFORNIA IS DOING

01:44:55.322 --> 01:44:57.057
THINGS THAT WE'RE FINALLY

01:44:57.124 --> 01:44:58.325
JOINING SOME OF THE OTHER STATES

01:44:58.392 --> 01:44:59.860
IN THE UNION SUPPORTING AND

01:44:59.926 --> 01:45:02.095
LOVING OUR VETERANS, A FULL

01:45:02.162 --> 01:45:03.997
DISABLED VETERANS PROPERTY TAX

01:45:04.064 --> 01:45:06.033
EXEMPTION IS A COURTESY PROVIDED

01:45:06.099 --> 01:45:08.235
IN NUMEROUS STATES, INCLUDING

01:45:08.301 --> 01:45:10.370
TEXAS, WHICH RECENTLY SURPASSED

01:45:10.437 --> 01:45:11.805
CALIFORNIA AND BECOMING THE

01:45:11.872 --> 01:45:14.307
STATE WITH THE LARGEST NUMBER OF

01:45:14.374 --> 01:45:16.243
VETERANS. BUT WE WANT THAT

01:45:16.309 --> 01:45:17.411
POPULATION BACK. WE WANT TO HOLD

01:45:17.477 --> 01:45:19.179
OUR VETERANS HERE. OTHER STATES

01:45:19.246 --> 01:45:21.648
HAVE PASSED LEGISLATION SIMILAR

01:45:21.715 --> 01:45:24.251
TO SENATE BILL 296 INCLUDE

01:45:24.317 --> 01:45:24.951
FLORIDA, VIRGINIA, NEW MEXICO

01:45:25.018 --> 01:45:28.422
AND HAWAII. WE MUST DO MORE TO

01:45:28.488 --> 01:45:29.890
ENSURE THAT OUR VETERANS CAN

01:45:29.956 --> 01:45:31.792
AFFORD TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:45:31.858 --> 01:45:32.793
AND IT'S MY HOPE THAT SENATE

01:45:32.859 --> 01:45:35.095
BILL 296 WILL GIVE VETERANS A

01:45:35.162 --> 01:45:37.130
MUCH NEEDED TAX RELIEF DURING

01:45:37.197 --> 01:45:39.299
THESE TOUGH TIMES, AND WILL OPEN

01:45:39.366 --> 01:45:42.269
UP THE DOOR FOR THEM TO STAY IN

01:45:42.335 --> 01:45:43.704
CALIFORNIA, BUY A HOME IN

01:45:43.770 --> 01:45:45.205
CALIFORNIA, AND RAISE THEIR

01:45:45.272 --> 01:45:46.840
FAMILIES. SO WITH ME TODAY, I

01:45:46.907 --> 01:45:49.242
WOULD NORMALLY HAVE ONE OF OUR

01:45:49.309 --> 01:45:51.011
VETERANS, BUT THEY WERE BOTH

01:45:51.078 --> 01:45:54.414
CALLED AWAY. SO MY PRESENTATION

01:45:54.481 --> 01:45:56.883
IS JUST FOR ME. A VETERAN WHO

01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:59.019
SERVED WITH THE 82ND AIRBORNE, A

01:45:59.086 --> 01:46:00.353
VETERAN WHO HAS TWO SONS THAT

01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:01.955
ARE STILL SERVING RIGHT NOW WHO

01:46:02.022 --> 01:46:04.024
ARE BOTH WEST POINT GRADUATES,

01:46:04.091 --> 01:46:05.826
PARATROOPERS LIKE I WAS, AND

01:46:05.892 --> 01:46:07.627
THEY'RE RAISING THEIR FAMILY. SO

01:46:07.694 --> 01:46:09.429
I WAS JUST INFORMED EARLY THIS

01:46:09.496 --> 01:46:12.265
MORNING THAT MY SON, WHO'S IN

01:46:12.332 --> 01:46:14.735
GERMANY, WILL BE BACK IN

01:46:14.801 --> 01:46:16.336
CALIFORNIA NEXT YEAR AT THIS

01:46:16.403 --> 01:46:18.438
TIME, AND I'M HOPING THAT HE CAN

01:46:18.505 --> 01:46:19.806
GO AHEAD AND THINK ABOUT BUYING

01:46:19.873 --> 01:46:20.907
HIS HOME AND STAYING IN

01:46:20.974 --> 01:46:23.577
CALIFORNIA. THE OTHER ONE IS

01:46:23.643 --> 01:46:25.946
100% DISABLED, AND HE'S LOOKING

01:46:26.012 --> 01:46:28.048
TO COME BACK IN TWO YEARS, AND

01:46:28.115 --> 01:46:31.451
HOPEFULLY HE'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE

01:46:31.518 --> 01:46:33.186
THE ABILITY TO BUY HIS HOME

01:46:33.253 --> 01:46:35.355
BECAUSE OF SENATE BILL 296. AND

01:46:35.422 --> 01:46:37.491
WITH THAT, I URGE AN AYE VOTE.

01:46:37.557 --> 01:46:39.092
