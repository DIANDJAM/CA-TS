00:53:45.155 --> 00:53:47.157
I WOULD EVEN BE HERE TODAY IF IT

WEREN'T FOR ME ACCEPTING THOSE

00:53:48.692 --> 00:53:49.960

00:53:50.026 --> 00:53:52.028
MADAM CHAIR. I AM HERE TO

PRESENT SB 371, AND I DO WANT TO

00:53:53.463 --> 00:53:54.965
BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE AUTHORS

00:53:55.031 --> 00:53:56.333
OF MINUTES I BELIEVE TECHNICALLY

00:53:56.399 --> 00:53:58.335
WILL BE TAKING THEM IN IN THE

00:53:58.401 --> 00:53:58.835
NEXT COMMUNICATIONS AND

00:53:58.902 --> 00:53:59.769
CONVEYANCE, WHICH IS HEARING THE

00:53:59.836 --> 00:54:01.871
SAME BILL LATER TODAY. YES, BUT

00:54:01.938 --> 00:54:03.740
THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO THE

00:54:03.807 --> 00:54:05.442
CHAIR AND THE STAFF FOR ALL THE

00:54:05.508 --> 00:54:07.043
WORK ON THE BILL. I'M HERE TO

00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:09.045
PRESENT THIS BILL. WE, THE

00:54:09.112 --> 00:54:10.880
LEGISLATURE, SET THE INSURANCE

00:54:10.947 --> 00:54:13.850
LIMITS FOR UBER AND LYFT AND

00:54:13.917 --> 00:54:14.818
OTHER RIDESHARE COMPANIES A

00:54:14.884 --> 00:54:16.486
LITTLE OVER A DECADE AGO, WHEN

00:54:16.553 --> 00:54:19.089
THE SECTOR WAS BRAND NEW, THE

00:54:19.155 --> 00:54:21.324
SENATE COMMITTEE HEARING

00:54:21.391 --> 00:54:23.860
DOCUMENTS ON THE INSURANCE ISSUE

00:54:23.927 --> 00:54:25.762
DESCRIBED THIS STRANGE, EXOTIC

00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:28.498
NEW IDEA THAT WAS OUT THERE. AND

00:54:28.565 --> 00:54:30.000
AT ONE OF THE INFORMATIONAL

00:54:30.066 --> 00:54:31.134
HEARINGS, THE STAFF REPORTED

00:54:31.201 --> 00:54:33.236
THAT THEY THAT THEY HAD ACTUALLY

00:54:33.303 --> 00:54:36.473
SECURED A LIVE HUMAN DRIVER THAT

00:54:36.539 --> 00:54:38.241
WAS DRIVING RIDESHARE IN ORDER

00:54:38.308 --> 00:54:39.909
TO MAKE MONEY THAT THIS WAS SUCH

00:54:39.976 --> 00:54:42.145
A IT'S SUCH A STRANGE CONCEPT.

00:54:42.212 --> 00:54:44.047
AND AT THE TIME, IF NONE OF YOU

00:54:44.114 --> 00:54:45.115
ARE OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER THIS,

00:54:45.181 --> 00:54:46.850
BUT MANY CALIFORNIANS WERE LIKE,

00:54:46.916 --> 00:54:48.151
I'M NOT GETTING IN THAT UNLESS

00:54:48.218 --> 00:54:49.319
I'M NOT GETTING IN SOME

00:54:49.386 --> 00:54:51.988
STRANGER'S CAR, UNLESS IT HAS $5

00:54:52.055 --> 00:54:53.523
BILLION WORTH OF INSURANCE

00:54:53.590 --> 00:54:55.225
COVERAGE. YOU KNOW, I NEED A I

00:54:55.291 --> 00:54:57.661
NEED A GUIDE DOG ANIMAL WITH ME.

00:54:57.727 --> 00:54:58.995
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THIS AT ALL.

00:54:59.062 --> 00:55:01.264
IT WAS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

00:55:01.331 --> 00:55:03.099
MARKET TODAY. RIDESHARE IS A

00:55:03.166 --> 00:55:04.200
FUNDAMENTAL PART OF THE

00:55:04.267 --> 00:55:05.635
TRANSPORTATION TRANSPORTATION

00:55:05.702 --> 00:55:07.103
ECOSYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA, AND NOT

00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:08.938
JUST IN THE WAYS THAT WE

00:55:09.005 --> 00:55:09.739
SOMETIMES THINK, ESPECIALLY

00:55:09.806 --> 00:55:11.941
THOSE OF US THAT ARE IN RURAL

00:55:12.008 --> 00:55:13.243
AND SUBURBAN AREAS. RIDESHARE

00:55:13.309 --> 00:55:14.611
PUBLICLY CONTRACTED BUT

00:55:14.678 --> 00:55:15.945
PRIVATELY OPERATED RIDESHARE NOT

00:55:16.012 --> 00:55:18.181
UBER AND LYFT, BUT COVERED. BUT

00:55:18.248 --> 00:55:20.750
OTHER TNCS ARE THE BACKBONE

00:55:20.817 --> 00:55:23.286
TRANSIT SYSTEMS IN MY COUNTY OF

00:55:23.353 --> 00:55:24.754
YOLO, INCREASINGLY IN OTHER

00:55:24.821 --> 00:55:26.523
PARTS OF CALIFORNIA. SO THEY'RE

00:55:26.589 --> 00:55:29.392
NO LONGER SIMPLY AN OPTIONAL AN

00:55:29.459 --> 00:55:30.427
OPTION. THEY ARE NOT AN

00:55:30.493 --> 00:55:31.995
ALTERNATIVE TO TAXIS OR OTHER

00:55:32.062 --> 00:55:33.930
FORMS, BUT AS YOU KNOW, AS PART

00:55:33.997 --> 00:55:35.465
OF THAT ORIGINAL SCOPING A

00:55:35.532 --> 00:55:37.067
DECADE AGO, AND I WOULD POINT

00:55:37.133 --> 00:55:38.301
OUT, THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AT

00:55:38.368 --> 00:55:39.869
THAT TIME POINTED OUT, HEY, IT'S

00:55:39.936 --> 00:55:41.371
ANYBODY'S GUESS WHAT THE RIGHT

00:55:41.438 --> 00:55:42.038
INSURANCE LIMITS ARE. WE'VE GOT

00:55:42.105 --> 00:55:44.107
TO DO SOMETHING, BUT WE'VE GOT

00:55:44.174 --> 00:55:45.942
TO PUT SOMETHING IN PLACE. AND

00:55:46.009 --> 00:55:47.711
THAT WAS NECESSARY. AND THOSE

00:55:47.777 --> 00:55:49.846
LIMITS WERE INTENDED TO PROTECT,

00:55:49.913 --> 00:55:52.048
PROTECT DRIVERS AND RIDERS AND

00:55:52.115 --> 00:55:53.049
OTHERS. SO THESE LIMITS APPLY

00:55:53.116 --> 00:55:54.784
ONLY TO IN THE EVENT WHERE

00:55:54.851 --> 00:55:57.153
THERE'S UNINSURED OR

00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:58.054
UNDERINSURED MOTORIST COVERAGE

00:55:58.121 --> 00:55:59.989
THAT'S KICKING IN, REMEMBER THAT

00:56:00.056 --> 00:56:02.425
DRIVERS ARE PROTECTED THROUGH

00:56:02.492 --> 00:56:03.960
SEVERAL LAYERS OF INSURANCE

00:56:04.027 --> 00:56:05.395
PROTECTION, INCLUDING THE DIRECT

00:56:05.462 --> 00:56:07.497
DRIVER COVERAGE FROM THE

00:56:07.564 --> 00:56:09.365
COMPANIES. BUT RIDERS ARE ALSO

00:56:09.432 --> 00:56:10.800
PROTECTED BY THE COVERAGE THAT

00:56:10.867 --> 00:56:12.902
IS PROVIDED MORE GENERALLY IN

00:56:12.969 --> 00:56:14.104
THE VEHICLE AND THEIR OWN

00:56:14.170 --> 00:56:15.071
COVERAGE WHEN THERE IS

00:56:15.138 --> 00:56:17.273
INSUFFICIENT OR NO COVERAGE BY

00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:19.109
ANOTHER DRIVER WHO IS AT FAULT.

00:56:19.175 --> 00:56:20.577
THAT'S THE ISSUE. THAT'S THE

00:56:20.643 --> 00:56:21.945
ZONE IN WHICH WE'RE SPEAKING

00:56:22.011 --> 00:56:24.214
ABOUT IN THIS BILL. SO THIS BILL

00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:25.315
TAKES THE LIMITS THAT WERE PUT

00:56:25.381 --> 00:56:28.017
IN PLACE AS A AS AN INTERIM.

00:56:28.084 --> 00:56:29.886
IT'S QUOTE UNQUOTE, ANYBODY'S

00:56:29.953 --> 00:56:31.855
GUESS APPROACH A LITTLE OVER A

00:56:31.921 --> 00:56:33.423
DECADE AGO AND REPLACES THEM

00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:34.924
WITH THESE AMENDMENTS WITH

00:56:34.991 --> 00:56:36.960
LIMITS OF $100,000 PER, PER,

00:56:37.026 --> 00:56:40.864
PER, PER PERSON, $300,000 PER

00:56:40.930 --> 00:56:42.832
PASSENGERS IN THE VEHICLE TO

00:56:42.899 --> 00:56:44.734
MODERNIZE, INCLUDING LANGUAGE TO

00:56:44.801 --> 00:56:47.203
PROVIDE FOR ADDITIONAL DATA

00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:48.271
ANALYSIS STUDIES AND

00:56:48.338 --> 00:56:49.372
ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY

00:56:49.439 --> 00:56:50.807
IN ORDER TO ASSURE THAT THIS IS

00:56:50.874 --> 00:56:52.208
THE RIGHT THING. RIDESHARE IS

00:56:52.275 --> 00:56:54.410
NOW ONE OF THE ONE OF THE MOST

00:56:54.477 --> 00:56:55.779
SIGNIFICANT COSTS THAT THAT

00:56:55.845 --> 00:56:56.880
CALIFORNIANS FACE IN THEIR

00:56:56.946 --> 00:56:58.348
TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS IF THEY

00:56:58.414 --> 00:57:00.116
DON'T OWN A CAR. OR LIKE

00:57:00.183 --> 00:57:01.718
YESTERDAY, AS I WAS HEADING TO

00:57:01.785 --> 00:57:05.255
SURGERY, I COULDN'T DRIVE. THERE

00:57:05.321 --> 00:57:06.923
ARE NO AND THERE WAS NO OTHER

00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:08.825
ALTERNATIVE. AND SO THE

00:57:08.892 --> 00:57:10.160
AFFORDABILITY OF RIDESHARE AS A

00:57:10.226 --> 00:57:11.961
AS AN OPTION FOR CALIFORNIANS IS

00:57:12.028 --> 00:57:13.329
ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. AND THE

00:57:13.396 --> 00:57:15.198
COST OF UNINSURED AND

00:57:15.265 --> 00:57:17.300
UNDERINSURED MOTORIST COVERAGE

00:57:17.367 --> 00:57:18.401
FOR THE RIDESHARE COMPANIES AND

00:57:18.468 --> 00:57:21.004
THEREFORE FOR RIDERS HAS GROWN

00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:22.071
SO SUBSTANTIALLY THAT IT IS IT

00:57:22.138 --> 00:57:24.974
IS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE

00:57:25.041 --> 00:57:26.442
FARE. AND SO OUR EFFORTS HERE IN

00:57:26.509 --> 00:57:28.711
THIS BILL ARE TO TRY TO REDUCE

00:57:28.778 --> 00:57:31.181
THE COST OF, OF, OF, OF

00:57:31.247 --> 00:57:33.216
INSURANCE FOR THE RIDES AND

00:57:33.283 --> 00:57:35.151
THEREFORE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE

00:57:35.218 --> 00:57:37.187
THE COST OF THE FARES FOR THE

00:57:37.253 --> 00:57:38.788
RIDERS. THAT'S THE BILL IN A

00:57:38.855 --> 00:57:40.223
NUTSHELL. LOOK FORWARD TO ROBUST

00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:40.990
CONVERSATION HERE. AND THANK YOU

00:57:41.057 --> 00:57:42.859
AGAIN FOR THE COMMITTEE'S WORK

00:57:42.926 --> 00:57:44.294
FOR THE AMENDMENTS. WOULD ASK

00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:45.762

00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:48.097

00:58:20.296 --> 00:58:21.564
EXPRESS OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR

00:58:21.631 --> 00:58:24.334
SB 371, A TARGETED FIX TO A

00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:26.135
PROBLEM THAT'S QUIETLY MAKING

00:58:26.202 --> 00:58:28.037
RIDESHARE MORE EXPENSIVE FOR

00:58:28.104 --> 00:58:30.874
MILLIONS OF RIDERS. TODAY. EACH

00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:32.642
TRIP IS COVERED BY MULTIPLE

00:58:32.709 --> 00:58:34.377
FORMS OF INSURANCE. AS SENATOR

00:58:34.444 --> 00:58:36.679
CABALDON JUST ALLUDED TO $1

00:58:36.746 --> 00:58:38.448
MILLION IN LIABILITY INSURANCE,

00:58:38.514 --> 00:58:39.415
$1 MILLION IN OCCUPATIONAL

00:58:39.482 --> 00:58:41.317
ACCIDENT INSURANCE TO PROTECT

00:58:41.384 --> 00:58:42.685
DRIVERS PHYSICAL DAMAGE

00:58:42.752 --> 00:58:44.520
COVERAGE. THREE COVERAGES THAT

00:58:44.587 --> 00:58:46.155
WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT TODAY,

00:58:46.222 --> 00:58:49.392
AS SB 371 DOES NOT TOUCH THEM.

00:58:49.459 --> 00:58:51.995
LASTLY, $1 MILLION IN UNINSURED

00:58:52.061 --> 00:58:53.796
AND UNDERINSURED MOTORIST

00:58:53.863 --> 00:58:54.964
COVERAGE COVERAGE FOR WHEN

00:58:55.031 --> 00:58:57.000
RIDESHARE DRIVERS ARE NOT AT

00:58:57.066 --> 00:58:58.768
FAULT. NO OTHER VEHICLES ON

00:58:58.835 --> 00:59:01.170
CALIFORNIA ROADS ARE REQUIRED TO

00:59:01.237 --> 00:59:03.606
CARRY THIS. NOT TAXIS, NOT

00:59:03.673 --> 00:59:05.808
LIMOUSINES, NOT PUBLIC SCHOOL

00:59:05.875 --> 00:59:08.611
BUSSES. NOBODY RIDESHARE ALONE.

00:59:08.678 --> 00:59:10.446
AND THIS POLICY HAS BECOME THE

00:59:10.513 --> 00:59:12.181
SINGLE BIGGEST COST DRIVER IN

00:59:12.248 --> 00:59:15.018
LOS ANGELES COUNTY. UP TO 45% OF

00:59:15.084 --> 00:59:16.586
EVERY FARE GOES TO GOVERNMENT

00:59:16.653 --> 00:59:19.455
MANDATED INSURANCE, AROUND 33%

00:59:19.522 --> 00:59:21.357
FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO

00:59:21.424 --> 00:59:23.860
BE CLEAR, THIS INSURANCE IS A

00:59:23.927 --> 00:59:25.895
PASS THROUGH TO RIDERS TODAY,

00:59:25.962 --> 00:59:27.764
AND YOU CAN SEE IT ON ANY OF

00:59:27.830 --> 00:59:29.032
YOUR OWN INDIVIDUAL RECEIPTS ON

00:59:29.098 --> 00:59:31.367
THE BOOKING FEE. THESE INFLATED

00:59:31.434 --> 00:59:33.102
COSTS ARE PASSED DIRECTLY TO THE

00:59:33.169 --> 00:59:34.170
PEOPLE WHO RELY ON RIDESHARE TO

00:59:34.237 --> 00:59:36.506
GET TO WORK, TO SCHOOL, TO

00:59:36.572 --> 00:59:37.707
DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENTS, AND

00:59:37.774 --> 00:59:38.875
THEY'RE CUTTING INTO THE

00:59:38.942 --> 00:59:40.443
EARNINGS OF DRIVERS WHO KEEP OUR

00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:42.211
PLATFORM MOVING. I'M PROUD TO

00:59:42.278 --> 00:59:43.913
HAVE A SUPPORT LETTER HERE WITH

00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:46.215
ME TODAY, SIGNED BY OVER 7000

00:59:46.282 --> 00:59:49.652
RIDESHARE DRIVERS. SB 371,

00:59:49.719 --> 00:59:51.688
INFORMED BY DATA, MODERNIZES THE

00:59:51.754 --> 00:59:53.589
COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS, BUT STILL

00:59:53.656 --> 00:59:55.525
ABOVE WHAT THE LAW REQUIRES FOR

00:59:55.591 --> 00:59:57.226
ANYBODY ELSE. IT DEFINES THAT

00:59:57.293 --> 00:59:59.062
DRIVERS WILL NEVER HAVE TO CARRY

00:59:59.128 --> 01:00:00.797
THIS POLICY, AND IT ENSURES THAT

01:00:00.863 --> 01:00:02.966
RIDESHARE UIM POLICY WILL BE

01:00:03.032 --> 01:00:04.734
PRIMARY TO OTHERS LIKE IT. ON

01:00:04.801 --> 01:00:06.903
BEHALF OF UBER, I ENCOURAGE YOUR

01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:09.539
SUPPORT OF SB 371 SO WE CAN

01:00:09.605 --> 01:00:10.773
CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION ON

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.408
THIS IMPORTANT REFORM, AND WE

01:00:12.475 --> 01:00:14.777
REMAIN COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH

01:00:14.844 --> 01:00:18.581
THIS COMMITTEE. THANK YOU. THANK

01:00:18.648 --> 01:00:19.916
YOU, THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING,

01:00:19.983 --> 01:00:20.950
MADAM CHAIR, AND ESTEEMED

01:00:21.017 --> 01:00:21.918
MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. MY

01:00:21.985 --> 01:00:23.519
NAME IS NICK JOHNSON, PUBLIC

01:00:23.586 --> 01:00:24.821
POLICY DIRECTOR FOR LYFT. AND

01:00:24.887 --> 01:00:26.122
I'M SPEAKING TODAY IN SUPPORT OF

01:00:26.189 --> 01:00:28.925
SENATE BILL 371. SENATE BILL 371

01:00:28.992 --> 01:00:30.226
AIMS TO ADDRESS THE

01:00:30.293 --> 01:00:31.327
AFFORDABILITY OF RIDESHARE

01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:32.895
SERVICES BY ADJUSTING UNINSURED

01:00:32.962 --> 01:00:34.297
AND UNDERINSURED MOTORIST

01:00:34.364 --> 01:00:35.665
COVERAGE LIMITS, WHICH WERE

01:00:35.732 --> 01:00:36.866
ESTABLISHED OVER A DECADE AGO.

01:00:36.933 --> 01:00:38.835
AS THE SENATOR SAID, I WANT TO

01:00:38.901 --> 01:00:39.569
ACKNOWLEDGE THE INHERENT

01:00:39.635 --> 01:00:40.703
CHALLENGES IN ESTABLISHING THOSE

01:00:40.770 --> 01:00:41.804
REQUIREMENTS TEN YEARS AGO,

01:00:41.871 --> 01:00:43.573
BECAUSE THERE WAS LIMITED DATA

01:00:43.639 --> 01:00:45.041
AND THIS WAS A NOVEL INDUSTRY

01:00:45.108 --> 01:00:47.610
THAT WAS ON THE RISE. SO WE

01:00:47.677 --> 01:00:49.012
RECOGNIZE THAT THIS PROPOSED

01:00:49.078 --> 01:00:51.881
CHANGE IS A PARADIGM SHIFT.

01:00:51.948 --> 01:00:53.316
NEVERTHELESS, OUR OBSERVATIONS

01:00:53.383 --> 01:00:54.150
INDICATE THAT THE ELEVATED

01:00:54.217 --> 01:00:56.619
LIMITS MANDATED BY UIM HAVE

01:00:56.686 --> 01:00:58.321
BECOME ECONOMICALLY INEFFICIENT.

01:00:58.388 --> 01:01:00.189
THIS INEFFICIENCY IS LARGELY

01:01:00.256 --> 01:01:01.524
ATTRIBUTABLE TO INFLATED

01:01:01.591 --> 01:01:02.859
ATTORNEY REPRESENTED CLAIMS,

01:01:02.925 --> 01:01:04.560
OFTEN INVOLVING SUBSTANTIAL

01:01:04.627 --> 01:01:05.895
CONTINGENCY FEES, WHICH

01:01:05.962 --> 01:01:07.330
CONSEQUENTLY DRIVE UP FARES. IT

01:01:07.397 --> 01:01:09.599
IS IMPORTANT TO DEFINE THE SCOPE

01:01:09.665 --> 01:01:10.533
WITHIN WHICH THIS BILL WOULD

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:13.069
OPERATE. UIM COVERAGE IS

01:01:13.136 --> 01:01:14.137
APPLICABLE WHEN OUR DRIVER IS

01:01:14.203 --> 01:01:16.339
NOT AT FAULT AS AN ACCIDENT. AS

01:01:16.406 --> 01:01:17.774
RAMONA SAID, THE BILL DOES NOT

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:19.909
ALTER OUR $1 MILLION LIABILITY

01:01:19.976 --> 01:01:21.411
COVERAGE, WHICH ADDRESSES

01:01:21.477 --> 01:01:22.845
ACCIDENTS IN WHICH OUR DRIVER IS

01:01:22.912 --> 01:01:25.548
AT FAULT. UIM CLAIMS CONSTITUTE

01:01:25.615 --> 01:01:26.849
A SMALL FRACTION OF THE CLAIMS

01:01:26.916 --> 01:01:29.085
THAT WE PROCESS ANNUALLY AT THE

01:01:29.152 --> 01:01:30.219
PROPOSED LIMITS. CALIFORNIA

01:01:30.286 --> 01:01:31.788
WOULD STILL MAINTAIN A HIGHER

01:01:31.854 --> 01:01:33.256
REQUIREMENT THAN 40 OTHER

01:01:33.322 --> 01:01:34.791
STATES. FURTHERMORE, IT IS

01:01:34.857 --> 01:01:36.159
NOTABLE THAT 26 STATES DO NOT

01:01:36.225 --> 01:01:37.593
REQUIRE THIS THIS COVERAGE AT

01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:39.829
ALL FOR TNCS, AND AS RAMONA

01:01:39.896 --> 01:01:40.930
SAID, NO OTHER COMMERCIAL MODE

01:01:40.997 --> 01:01:42.331
OF TRANSPORTATION IN CALIFORNIA

01:01:42.398 --> 01:01:44.434
REQUIRES THIS SPECIFIC TYPE OF

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.302
INSURANCE. OUR REQUEST TODAY IS

01:01:46.369 --> 01:01:48.071
SIMPLY TO MAINTAIN THIS POLICY

01:01:48.137 --> 01:01:49.238
REQUIREMENT AT A LEVEL THAT

01:01:49.305 --> 01:01:50.206
WOULD ADEQUATELY COVER THE

01:01:50.273 --> 01:01:52.175
MAJORITY OF UIM CLAIMS OCCURRING

01:01:52.241 --> 01:01:54.210
ON OUR PLATFORM, AND MAKE OUR

01:01:54.277 --> 01:01:55.912
POLICY PRIMARY TO THAT OF

01:01:55.978 --> 01:01:58.281
PASSENGER UIM. THE OBJECTIVE OF

01:01:58.347 --> 01:02:00.049
THIS LIMIT REDUCTION IS NOT TO

01:02:00.116 --> 01:02:01.517
ACHIEVE A WINDFALL. RATHER, IT

01:02:01.584 --> 01:02:03.086
IS TO ENHANCE THE AFFORDABILITY

01:02:03.152 --> 01:02:05.088
OF RIDESHARE, INCREASE

01:02:05.154 --> 01:02:06.889
PROFITABILITY FOR DRIVERS, AND

01:02:06.956 --> 01:02:07.824
DISINCENTIVIZE BAD BEHAVIOR IN

01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:09.659
THE LEGAL SYSTEM. I THANK YOU

01:02:09.725 --> 01:02:11.294
FOR YOUR TIME AND RESPECTFULLY

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:12.695
REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU,

01:02:12.762 --> 01:02:14.664
THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER

01:02:14.730 --> 01:02:16.766
WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IN THE

01:02:16.833 --> 01:02:24.807
ROOM? PLEASE COME FORWARD. GOOD

01:02:24.874 --> 01:02:25.908

THANK YOU. OKAY. DO WE HAVE ANY

SO, PLEASE COME FORWARD. YOU CAN

01:03:46.589 --> 01:04:01.671

MADAM CHAIR, MEMBERS OF THE

RESPECTFULLY EXPRESS OUR

01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:08.778
OPPOSED, UNLESS AMENDED,

01:04:08.844 --> 01:04:11.781
POSITION ON SB 371. THIS BILL

01:04:11.847 --> 01:04:12.882
PROPOSES A DRASTIC REDUCTION IN

01:04:12.949 --> 01:04:13.916
THE UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED

01:04:13.983 --> 01:04:16.319
MOTORIST COVERAGE UIM REQUIRED

01:04:16.385 --> 01:04:17.887
OF UBER AND LYFT FROM $1 MILLION

01:04:17.954 --> 01:04:19.589
DOWN TO JUST $100,000 PER

01:04:19.655 --> 01:04:21.824
PERSON, $300,000 PER INCIDENT.

01:04:21.891 --> 01:04:24.360
IT'S A 90% CUT IN PROTECTION FOR

01:04:24.427 --> 01:04:25.795
PASSENGERS AND DRIVERS WHO WERE

01:04:25.861 --> 01:04:26.929
INJURED BY UNINSURED OR

01:04:26.996 --> 01:04:28.097
UNDERINSURED MOTORISTS. WE THANK

01:04:28.164 --> 01:04:29.632
THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK ON

01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:30.866
IMPROVING THE BILL FROM THE

01:04:30.933 --> 01:04:32.768
LANGUAGE IN PRINT, WHICH

01:04:32.835 --> 01:04:34.036
PROPOSED A 95% REDUCTION TO

01:04:34.103 --> 01:04:36.305
50,000 $100,000. HOWEVER, MORE

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:38.007
WORK MUST BE DONE. MAKE NO

01:04:38.074 --> 01:04:39.075
MISTAKE, THIS IS A CORPORATE

01:04:39.141 --> 01:04:41.611
WINDFALL AT THE EXPENSE OF REAL

01:04:41.677 --> 01:04:42.678
PEOPLE. CALIFORNIANS WHO RELY ON

01:04:42.745 --> 01:04:43.879
RIDESHARE SERVICES DESERVE TO

01:04:43.946 --> 01:04:45.815
KNOW THAT IF THEY'RE SERIOUSLY

01:04:45.881 --> 01:04:46.349
INJURED BY A RECKLESS OR

01:04:46.415 --> 01:04:47.550
UNINSURED DRIVER, THEY'LL BE

01:04:47.617 --> 01:04:49.719
COVERED. BUT UNDER SB SEVEN 371,

01:04:49.785 --> 01:04:51.087
THEY COULD BE LEFT WITH HUNDREDS

01:04:51.153 --> 01:04:52.788
OF THOUSANDS IN MEDICAL BILLS,

01:04:52.855 --> 01:04:54.690
LOST WAGES AND LONG TERM

01:04:54.757 --> 01:04:56.392
DISABILITY WITHOUT MEANINGFUL

01:04:56.459 --> 01:04:57.426
COMPENSATION. THIS BILL ALSO

01:04:57.493 --> 01:04:59.562
LEAVES DRIVERS DANGEROUSLY

01:04:59.629 --> 01:05:00.963
UNDER-PROTECTED IN SERIOUS

01:05:01.030 --> 01:05:02.865
CRASHES. UNLIKE UIM, THE

01:05:02.932 --> 01:05:03.899
OCCUPATIONAL ACCIDENT INSURANCE

01:05:03.966 --> 01:05:06.002
PROVIDED UNDER PROPOSITION 22

01:05:06.068 --> 01:05:07.870
EXCLUDES COMPENSATION FOR PAIN,

01:05:07.937 --> 01:05:09.105
SUFFERING, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS

01:05:09.171 --> 01:05:10.773
AND PERMANENT DISABILITY,

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:11.807
LEAVING DRIVERS WITH ONLY

01:05:11.874 --> 01:05:13.309
PARTIAL COVERAGE AND SUBSTANTIAL

01:05:13.376 --> 01:05:15.378
OUT-OF-POCKET COSTS. MOREOVER,

01:05:15.444 --> 01:05:17.346
UBER'S INSURER DELAYS ACCESS TO

01:05:17.413 --> 01:05:18.614
UIM BENEFITS BY CREATING A

01:05:18.681 --> 01:05:19.849
PROCEDURAL ROADBLOCK AT A TIME

01:05:19.915 --> 01:05:21.417
WHEN INJURED DRIVERS ARE

01:05:21.484 --> 01:05:21.984
STRUGGLING TO RECOVER BOTH

01:05:22.051 --> 01:05:24.620
PHYSICALLY AND FINANCIALLY. THE

01:05:24.687 --> 01:05:26.722
REDUCTION IN SB 371 WOULD PLACE

01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:28.291
DRIVERS IN A POSITION WITH FEWER

01:05:28.357 --> 01:05:29.592
RIGHTS, AND NO GUARANTEE THAT

01:05:29.659 --> 01:05:30.960
ANY CORPORATE SAVINGS WILL BE

01:05:31.027 --> 01:05:33.362
PASSED ALONG FOR THEIR BENEFIT.

01:05:33.429 --> 01:05:34.697
ONE WAY TO AMELIORATE THE HARSH

01:05:34.764 --> 01:05:35.965
IMPACT OF THE REDUCED LIMITS

01:05:36.032 --> 01:05:37.800
WOULD BE TO MAKE SURE THAT TNC

01:05:37.867 --> 01:05:39.068
DRIVERS AND PASSENGERS CAN

01:05:39.135 --> 01:05:41.604
ACCESS THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE

01:05:41.671 --> 01:05:44.106
TNC. UIM REDUCED $100,000

01:05:44.173 --> 01:05:46.142
COVERAGE, IF WARRANTED BY THEIR

01:05:46.208 --> 01:05:47.276
INJURIES. BY ELIMINATING A

01:05:47.343 --> 01:05:48.678
CREDIT AGAINST THE UIM POLICY

01:05:48.744 --> 01:05:50.246
FOR THE AMOUNT OF THE AT FAULT

01:05:50.313 --> 01:05:52.348
DRIVER'S POLICY, UBER RECENTLY

01:05:52.415 --> 01:05:54.183
AGREED TO THIS PROVISION IN THE

01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:55.151
STATE OF VIRGINIA. WE UNDERSTAND

01:05:55.217 --> 01:05:56.085
SEVERAL OTHER STATES ALSO MAKE

01:05:56.152 --> 01:05:58.054
SURE THE FULL VALUE OF THE

01:05:58.120 --> 01:05:59.188
POLICY IS ACCESSIBLE TO TNC

01:05:59.255 --> 01:06:00.556
DRIVERS AND PASSENGERS WHEN

01:06:00.623 --> 01:06:02.024
NEEDED. THIS COVERAGE IS NOT A

01:06:02.091 --> 01:06:03.526
LUXURY, IT'S A CRITICAL SAFETY

01:06:03.592 --> 01:06:05.695
NET. WE URGE YOU TO PROTECT

01:06:05.761 --> 01:06:06.796
INJURED CALIFORNIANS AND NOT

01:06:06.862 --> 01:06:07.863
MULTIBILLION DOLLAR

01:06:07.930 --> 01:06:09.965
CORPORATIONS. PLEASE REJECT SB

01:06:10.032 --> 01:06:12.935
371. THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR

01:06:13.002 --> 01:06:14.670
MEMBERS SARA FLOCKS, CALIFORNIA

01:06:14.737 --> 01:06:16.038
FEDERATION OF LABOR UNIONS. WE

01:06:16.105 --> 01:06:17.973
ARE ALSO OPPOSE, UNLESS AMENDED.

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:19.041
WE DO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR

01:06:19.108 --> 01:06:21.410
THEIR WORK ON THE BILL. BUT I

01:06:21.477 --> 01:06:23.746
WANTED TO GIVE SOME CONTEXT FOR

01:06:23.813 --> 01:06:26.148
THE CURRENT INSURANCE

01:06:26.215 --> 01:06:27.850
REQUIREMENTS FOR UBER AND LYFT

01:06:27.917 --> 01:06:31.420
AND TNCS. SO IN 2013, A SIX YEAR

01:06:31.487 --> 01:06:33.989
OLD CHILD WAS STRUCK AND KILLED

01:06:34.056 --> 01:06:36.325
BY A TNC DRIVER IN SAN

01:06:36.392 --> 01:06:37.827
FRANCISCO, WHICH PUT A SPOTLIGHT

01:06:37.893 --> 01:06:39.829
ON THE INDUSTRY AND REALLY

01:06:39.895 --> 01:06:41.564
EXPOSED THE GAPS IN COVERAGE.

01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:44.200
AND THAT IS WHEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:06:44.266 --> 01:06:45.401
BONILLA CAME IN WITH THE BILL

01:06:45.468 --> 01:06:47.370
THAT CURRENTLY SETS THE

01:06:47.436 --> 01:06:48.938
INSURANCE COVER, WHICH WAS

01:06:49.004 --> 01:06:50.673
SUPPORTED BY UBER AND LYFT AT

01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:54.210
THE TIME. PART OF THAT WAS

01:06:54.276 --> 01:06:55.311
RECOGNIZING THAT THIS WAS A

01:06:55.378 --> 01:06:58.314
UNIQUE INDUSTRY IN THAT AT THE

01:06:58.381 --> 01:06:59.882
TIME, THE COMPANIES WERE

01:06:59.949 --> 01:07:01.050
MISCLASSIFYING DRIVERS, THEY

01:07:01.117 --> 01:07:03.285
WERE USING THEIR PERSONAL

01:07:03.352 --> 01:07:04.954
VEHICLES, AND THE COMPANIES

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:07.490
DEPENDED ON A VERY LARGE

01:07:07.556 --> 01:07:10.092
DISPOSABLE POOL OF DRIVERS WHO

01:07:10.159 --> 01:07:11.827
WOULD COME IN AND DRIVE FOR

01:07:11.894 --> 01:07:13.162
SHORT AMOUNTS OF TIME, AND THERE

01:07:13.229 --> 01:07:15.431
WAS A LOT OF CYCLING THROUGH. SO

01:07:15.498 --> 01:07:17.266
THESE WERE DRIVERS WHO WERE NOT

01:07:17.333 --> 01:07:19.402
ALWAYS ON THE ROAD. THEY WERE

01:07:19.468 --> 01:07:21.203
NOT COVERED BY WORKERS COMP

01:07:21.270 --> 01:07:23.773
HEALTH INSURANCE. THEY WERE

01:07:23.839 --> 01:07:25.975
USING THEIR PERSONAL VEHICLES.

01:07:26.041 --> 01:07:27.743
THEY DID NOT HAVE THE SAME KIND

01:07:27.810 --> 01:07:29.545
OF REQUIREMENTS IN TERMS OF

01:07:29.612 --> 01:07:31.747
SECURITY TRAININGS OR

01:07:31.814 --> 01:07:33.182
INSPECTIONS THAT ANY OTHER

01:07:33.249 --> 01:07:35.317
DRIVER DID IN THE STATE,

01:07:35.384 --> 01:07:38.287
CREATING A LARGE AMOUNT OF RISK.

01:07:38.354 --> 01:07:39.321
THAT'S WHY THESE INSURANCE

01:07:39.388 --> 01:07:42.057
LEVELS WERE PUT INTO PLACE,

01:07:42.124 --> 01:07:43.926
BECAUSE THERE WAS THIS IS A

01:07:43.993 --> 01:07:45.728
DIFFERENT INDUSTRY WITH VERY

01:07:45.795 --> 01:07:47.630
DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS FOR

01:07:47.696 --> 01:07:50.699
DRIVERS. THE MISCLASSIFICATION

01:07:50.766 --> 01:07:52.868
OF DRIVERS AT THE TIME HAS NOW

01:07:52.935 --> 01:07:53.936
BECOME LAW BECAUSE OF

01:07:54.003 --> 01:07:57.039
PROPOSITION 22. THAT MEANS THAT

01:07:57.106 --> 01:07:58.774
THESE DRIVERS DO NOT HAVE

01:07:58.841 --> 01:08:00.409
WORKER'S COMPENSATION.

01:08:00.476 --> 01:08:02.077
OCCUPATIONAL ACCIDENT INDUSTRY

01:08:02.144 --> 01:08:04.280
IS NOT THE SAME COVERAGE. IT

01:08:04.346 --> 01:08:05.681
DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME

01:08:05.748 --> 01:08:08.083
GUARANTEES FOR WORKERS. THEY DO

01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:09.618
NOT HAVE GUARANTEED HEALTH

01:08:09.685 --> 01:08:11.487
COVERAGE AT THE SAME LEVELS.

01:08:11.554 --> 01:08:13.122
THEY DO NOT HAVE PAID TIME OFF.

01:08:13.189 --> 01:08:14.690
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY OF THE

01:08:14.757 --> 01:08:16.091
BENEFITS THAT ANY OTHER WORKER

01:08:16.158 --> 01:08:17.893
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOES

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:20.463
AS AN EMPLOYEE, PUTTING THEM AT

01:08:20.529 --> 01:08:22.331
MUCH GREATER RISK. THEY ALSO

01:08:22.398 --> 01:08:24.366
HAVE TO DO ALL OF THE

01:08:24.433 --> 01:08:25.734
REIMBURSEMENTS IN TERMS OF GAS

01:08:25.801 --> 01:08:29.238
AND REPAIRS TO THEIR CARS. SO

01:08:29.305 --> 01:08:31.574
THESE LEVELS ARE VERY IMPORTANT

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:33.642
TO PROVIDE TO PROTECT BOTH

01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:34.977
PASSENGERS, MANY WHO RELY ON

01:08:35.044 --> 01:08:37.346
THIS EVERY DAY TO GET TO WORK,

01:08:37.413 --> 01:08:41.317
AS WELL AS WORKERS, AND AT THE

01:08:41.383 --> 01:08:44.487
SAME TIME, TNCS DON'T HAVE ANY

01:08:44.553 --> 01:08:46.755
OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE

01:08:46.822 --> 01:08:47.990
STATE AS OTHER COMPANIES, SUCH

01:08:48.057 --> 01:08:49.992
AS PAYING PAYROLL TAXES INTO THE

01:08:50.059 --> 01:08:52.795
UI, FUND, WORKERS COMPENSATION,

01:08:52.862 --> 01:08:55.097
ANYTHING ELSE THAT IS KIND OF

01:08:55.164 --> 01:08:57.600
THE COLLECTIVE POOLED

01:08:57.666 --> 01:08:59.268
RESPONSIBILITY THAT INSURANCE IS

01:08:59.335 --> 01:09:03.906
BASED ON. AND SO FOR THOSE

01:09:03.973 --> 01:09:06.509
REASONS, WE ARE OPPOSED UNLESS

01:09:06.575 --> 01:09:07.910
AMENDED. WE WERE OPPOSED BECAUSE

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:09.678
WE THINK THESE INSURANCE LIMITS

01:09:09.745 --> 01:09:11.313
SHOULD BE IN PLACE. THESE

01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:12.548
INSURANCE LEVELS SHOULD BE IN

01:09:12.615 --> 01:09:14.450
PLACE, BUT OUR AMENDMENT WOULD

01:09:14.517 --> 01:09:16.118
BE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:19.555
GUARANTEE, NOT INTENT, NOT JUST

01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:21.223
IT LEAVING IT UP TO THE

01:09:21.290 --> 01:09:23.659
COMPANIES, BUT ACTUAL GUARANTEE

01:09:23.726 --> 01:09:25.861
THAT ALL OF THE COST SAVINGS

01:09:25.928 --> 01:09:27.930
FROM THIS REDUCTION IN INSURANCE

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:32.201
ARE PASSED ON TO DRIVERS AND TO

01:09:32.268 --> 01:09:33.068
RIDERS. BECAUSE THIS DOES

01:09:33.135 --> 01:09:33.936
THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL

01:09:34.003 --> 01:09:35.571
THAT GUARANTEES THIS. THERE'S

01:09:35.638 --> 01:09:37.206
NOTHING THAT PREVENTS

01:09:37.273 --> 01:09:38.774
ALGORITHMIC WAGE SETTING OR

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:41.777
SURGE PRICING OR ANYTHING THAT

01:09:41.844 --> 01:09:43.879
RIDERS AND DRIVERS DEAL WITH.

01:09:43.946 --> 01:09:45.948
FOR THAT REASON, WE REMAIN

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:48.817
OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED. THANK

01:09:48.884 --> 01:09:51.186
YOU. ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION IN

01:09:59.428 --> 01:10:00.763

RESPECTFULLY, I DON'T RECOGNIZE

01:10:02.164 --> 01:10:04.033
THE WORLD THAT THE AUTHOR

01:10:04.099 --> 01:10:05.834
DESCRIBED IN HIS OPEN. AND I SAY

01:10:05.901 --> 01:10:07.703
THAT AS SOMEONE WHO WAS A DECADE

01:10:07.770 --> 01:10:08.871
AGO AT THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:10:08.938 --> 01:10:10.739

01:10:10.806 --> 01:10:12.841
YOUNG GIRL WHO WAS KILLED WAS

01:10:12.908 --> 01:10:14.143
SOPHIA LIU. THAT WAS A REALLY

01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:16.745
TRAGIC EVENT THAT SHOULD NOT

01:10:16.812 --> 01:10:18.747
HAVE EVER HAPPENED. THANK YOU.

01:10:18.814 --> 01:10:21.350

CONCERNED THAT THE LOWERED COSTS

01:10:32.861 --> 01:10:34.663
WILL ENCOURAGE DISTRICTS TO

CONTRACT OUT WITH TNC. COMPANIES

01:10:36.865 --> 01:10:39.268
SUCH AS ZOOM AND HOP, SKIP AND

01:10:39.335 --> 01:10:41.470
DRIVE, WHICH WOULD ENDANGER THE

01:10:41.537 --> 01:10:43.272
LIVES OF STUDENTS. IT WOULD ALSO

01:10:43.339 --> 01:10:45.808
IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL

01:10:45.874 --> 01:10:48.410
BURDENS ON STAFF AND STUDENTS

01:10:48.477 --> 01:10:51.180

TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY. BUT

01:11:56.445 --> 01:11:57.713
I DO THINK WE REALLY NEED TO

01:11:57.780 --> 01:11:59.815
STRIKE A BALANCE HERE. YOU KNOW,

01:11:59.882 --> 01:12:01.550
WHAT I'M SEEING AS POSITIVES IN

01:12:01.617 --> 01:12:04.520
THIS BILL ARE IMPACT ON

01:12:04.586 --> 01:12:05.120
AFFORDABILITY AND THE AMOUNT

01:12:05.187 --> 01:12:07.122
THAT CONSUMERS ARE PAYING TO

01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:11.126
RIDE TO RIDE UBERS AND THEN ALSO

01:12:11.193 --> 01:12:14.329
POTENTIAL, YOU KNOW, POTENTIAL

01:12:14.396 --> 01:12:16.565
SUPPORT FOR DRIVERS, INCREASED

01:12:16.632 --> 01:12:19.134
PAY, BETTER BENEFITS. AND SO

01:12:19.201 --> 01:12:20.035
THAT'S REALLY WHAT I'M LOOKING

01:12:20.102 --> 01:12:22.204
AT, POSITIVE POSITIVES. BUT I AM

01:12:22.271 --> 01:12:23.739
CONCERNED ABOUT THE LIABILITY

01:12:23.806 --> 01:12:25.074
PIECE. AND I THINK IT'S STRIKING

01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:27.309
A BALANCE ON WHAT EXACTLY THE

01:12:27.376 --> 01:12:29.111
RIGHT NUMBER IS. SO I WILL BE

01:12:29.178 --> 01:12:30.746
VOTING FOR THIS BILL TODAY. I

01:12:30.813 --> 01:12:32.514
APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING IT AND

01:12:32.581 --> 01:12:34.283
APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION THAT

01:12:34.349 --> 01:12:34.883
EVERYONE'S HAVING ABOUT THIS

01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:39.254
BILL. THANKS. OKAY.

01:12:39.321 --> 01:12:43.392
ASSEMBLYWOMAN ORTEGA. THANK YOU,

01:12:43.459 --> 01:12:46.662
SENATOR, I APPRECIATE YOU

01:12:46.729 --> 01:12:47.896
POSTPONING YOUR SURGERY FOR

01:12:47.963 --> 01:12:52.735
TODAY. THE SURGEON DID THAT. I

01:12:52.801 --> 01:12:54.837
DO LIKE THE BILL, BUT BUT YOU

01:12:54.903 --> 01:12:56.972
KNOW, MY IT'S MY EYE IS MORE

01:12:57.039 --> 01:12:58.440
IMPORTANT THAN ANY BILL. BUT,

01:12:58.507 --> 01:13:01.410
YOU KNOW, I HAD A LOT OF

01:13:01.477 --> 01:13:03.645
QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS BILL. SO I

01:13:03.712 --> 01:13:06.515
WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR, AS YOU

01:13:06.582 --> 01:13:08.517
KNOW, LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT

01:13:08.584 --> 01:13:11.120
COMMITTEE CHAIR, MY COMMITTEE

01:13:11.186 --> 01:13:13.322
PASSED THE BILL FOR UBER AND

01:13:13.388 --> 01:13:18.727
LYFT DRIVERS TO UNIONIZE. AND I

01:13:18.794 --> 01:13:21.230
DON'T SEE ANY LABOR SUPPORT

01:13:21.296 --> 01:13:24.166
TODAY FOR THIS BILL. I DON'T

01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:25.934
KNOW WHY I HAVEN'T HAD AN

01:13:26.001 --> 01:13:27.102
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A LOT OF

01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:29.571
THOSE CONVERSATIONS. BUT WHAT I

01:13:29.638 --> 01:13:32.441
CAN TELL YOU IS THAT I'M VERY

01:13:32.508 --> 01:13:34.643
UNCOMFORTABLE, THAT THERE ARE NO

01:13:34.710 --> 01:13:37.146
GUARANTEES THAT ANY OF THE

01:13:37.212 --> 01:13:38.714
SAVINGS ON INSURANCE COSTS ARE

01:13:38.781 --> 01:13:40.682
GOING TO TRICKLE DOWN TO THE

01:13:40.749 --> 01:13:42.584
PEOPLE WHO ARE DRIVING THOSE

01:13:42.651 --> 01:13:45.687
CARS. I'VE BARGAINED A LOT OF

01:13:45.754 --> 01:13:49.391
CONTRACTS IN MY TIME, AND I KNOW

01:13:49.458 --> 01:13:51.493
WHAT A GUARANTEE LOOKS LIKE. AND

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:53.128
THIS VERSION OF YOUR BILL DOES

01:13:53.195 --> 01:13:56.231
NOT HAVE IT. SO UNFORTUNATELY, I

01:13:56.298 --> 01:14:00.102
CANNOT SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY.

01:14:00.169 --> 01:14:03.839
HEY, ASSEMBLYWOMAN ADDIS, THANK

01:14:03.906 --> 01:14:05.240
YOU. THANK YOU, SENATOR, AND I

01:14:05.307 --> 01:14:08.076
WANT TO APPRECIATE THE FOCUS YOU

01:14:08.143 --> 01:14:10.179
HAVE HERE ON AFFORDABILITY AND

01:14:10.245 --> 01:14:12.714
JUST THE INTENT OF THE BILL. I

01:14:12.781 --> 01:14:13.882
UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE TRYING

01:14:13.949 --> 01:14:16.084
TO GO, BUT JUST WAS WONDERING IF

01:14:16.151 --> 01:14:17.786
YOU COULD CLARIFY A LITTLE BIT

01:14:17.853 --> 01:14:20.255
MORE. I KNOW IT'S NOT IN THE

01:14:20.322 --> 01:14:21.657
BILL, PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF

01:14:21.723 --> 01:14:24.193
SAVINGS TO DRIVERS, SAVINGS TO

01:14:24.259 --> 01:14:25.327
RIDERS, BUT THINGS THAT YOU

01:14:25.394 --> 01:14:27.162
MIGHT BE THINKING ABOUT MOVING

01:14:27.229 --> 01:14:29.731
FORWARD OR THAT WE MIGHT SEE

01:14:29.798 --> 01:14:31.633
BEFORE THIS GETS, YOU KNOW, GOES

01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:33.569
TO THE FLOOR. I KNOW THERE'S

01:14:33.635 --> 01:14:37.239
STILL POTENTIALLY CONVERSATIONS

01:14:37.306 --> 01:14:38.640
THAT COULD BE HAD BEFORE THIS

01:14:38.707 --> 01:14:40.275
COMES TO THE FLOOR. AND SO WHAT

01:14:40.342 --> 01:14:41.844
YOU MIGHT BE LOOKING AT, I KNOW

01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:44.346
YOU TO BE A VERY THOUGHTFUL

01:14:44.413 --> 01:14:45.347
PERSON. AND SO IF YOU COULD

01:14:45.414 --> 01:14:47.683
CLARIFY A LITTLE BIT OF THAT,

01:14:47.749 --> 01:14:50.219
MADAM. MADAM CHAIR, MAY I

01:14:50.285 --> 01:14:55.324
RESPOND? YES. ALL RIGHT. THANKS.

01:14:55.390 --> 01:14:56.859
THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

01:14:56.925 --> 01:14:58.827
AND THANK YOU AND THANK I THE

01:14:58.894 --> 01:15:00.662
QUESTION IS AT THE CORE OF ALL

01:15:00.729 --> 01:15:01.897
OF THIS, BECAUSE THAT IS THAT IS

01:15:01.964 --> 01:15:04.399
THE PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE PURPOSE

01:15:04.466 --> 01:15:06.768
OF THE BILL IS TO IS TO REDUCE

01:15:06.835 --> 01:15:08.270
FARES FOR RIDERS AND ALSO TO

01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:10.772
IMPROVE COMPENSATION FOR

01:15:10.839 --> 01:15:13.242
DRIVERS, BOTH FOR THOSE TWO

01:15:13.308 --> 01:15:14.476
PURPOSES, BUT ALSO BECAUSE THIS

01:15:14.543 --> 01:15:18.814
IS A MARKET THAT IS IN IN SOME

01:15:18.881 --> 01:15:20.082
CHALLENGE. RIGHT. AND SO PART

01:15:20.148 --> 01:15:22.284
ONE OF THE REASONS FARES ARE SO

01:15:22.351 --> 01:15:23.252
HIGH IS THEY'RE NOT ENOUGH

01:15:23.318 --> 01:15:23.952
DRIVERS, YOU KNOW, OUT THERE.

01:15:24.019 --> 01:15:26.154
AND SO WE HAVE TO DO BOTH

01:15:26.221 --> 01:15:27.856
THINGS. AND SO THE BILL IS

01:15:27.923 --> 01:15:29.791
INTENDED TO DO BOTH OF THEM AT

01:15:29.858 --> 01:15:30.859
THE SAME TIME. I SPENT MOST OF

01:15:30.926 --> 01:15:32.661
MY TIME WORKING ON HOUSING

01:15:32.728 --> 01:15:34.096
ISSUES WHERE WE HAVE THE SAME

01:15:34.162 --> 01:15:35.697
EXACT THING, LIKE, OKAY, YOU'RE

01:15:35.764 --> 01:15:36.265
PROVIDING THIS STREAMLINED

01:15:36.331 --> 01:15:37.299
MINISTERIAL APPROVAL. CAN YOU

01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:38.867
GUARANTEE THAT THAT MEANS THE

01:15:38.934 --> 01:15:41.036
APARTMENT WILL BE $1,200 AND

01:15:41.103 --> 01:15:42.738
NOT, YOU KNOW, 2000 OR WHAT HAVE

01:15:42.804 --> 01:15:44.740
YOU? AND I THINK GENERALLY

01:15:44.806 --> 01:15:47.075
THAT'S REALLY HARD TO DO IN THE

01:15:47.142 --> 01:15:48.977
PRIVATE MARKETPLACE. AND SO

01:15:49.044 --> 01:15:49.845
WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH

01:15:49.912 --> 01:15:51.413
EXACTLY HOW WOULD WE ACCOMPLISH

01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:53.081
THAT. NO ONE WANTS TO DO THAT

01:15:53.148 --> 01:15:54.716
MORE THAN ME, THOUGH. SO, YOU

01:15:54.783 --> 01:15:55.918
KNOW, FOLKS HAVE BEEN, YOU KNOW,

01:15:55.984 --> 01:15:58.220
IDEAS HAVE BEEN SWIRLING AROUND.

01:15:58.287 --> 01:16:00.322
I'VE TALKED TO THE TO THE CHAIR

01:16:00.389 --> 01:16:00.956
ABOUT IT AS WELL, AND ALSO THE

01:16:01.023 --> 01:16:02.057
CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE ABOUT

01:16:02.124 --> 01:16:03.759
MECHANISMS THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE

01:16:03.825 --> 01:16:05.460
TO, YOU KNOW, GET THE GET

01:16:05.527 --> 01:16:06.595
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT, YOU

01:16:06.662 --> 01:16:08.030
KNOW, A LOOK BACK, THE LANGUAGE

01:16:08.096 --> 01:16:09.898
THAT'S IN THE BILL THAT THE

01:16:09.965 --> 01:16:10.565
COMMITTEE PUT TOGETHER WILL HELP

01:16:10.632 --> 01:16:12.301
US DO THAT. BUT, YOU KNOW, BEING

01:16:12.367 --> 01:16:13.669
EXPLICIT THAT IT'LL LOOK BACK,

01:16:13.735 --> 01:16:15.637
YOU KNOW, WHAT HAPPENED. AND IF

01:16:15.704 --> 01:16:16.872
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN THE WAY THAT

01:16:16.939 --> 01:16:18.740
WE'RE EXPECTING AS WE DO THIS,

01:16:18.807 --> 01:16:20.108
THEN THEN WE'D HAVE WE'D COME

01:16:20.175 --> 01:16:23.078
BACK AND LOOK AT IT AGAIN. SO I

01:16:23.145 --> 01:16:24.012
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE EXACT ANSWER

01:16:24.079 --> 01:16:26.081
IS, BUT I ABSOLUTELY SHARE YOUR

01:16:26.148 --> 01:16:26.748
INTEREST IN THE TRANSPARENCY AND

01:16:26.815 --> 01:16:27.349
ACCOUNTABILITY TO ASSURE THAT

01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:28.817
WE'RE DOING THIS. FOR THAT, WE

01:16:28.884 --> 01:16:30.185
ARE DOING THAT. WE'RE GOING TO

01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:31.720
ACCOMPLISH WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:16:31.787 --> 01:16:33.055
DO HERE AND ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED

01:16:33.121 --> 01:16:34.957
TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH EVERY

01:16:35.023 --> 01:16:36.091
EVERY PARTY CRAZY SUPPORTER,

01:16:36.158 --> 01:16:37.726
OPPONENT THAT HAS IDEAS ABOUT

01:16:37.793 --> 01:16:39.161
HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO

01:16:39.227 --> 01:16:40.829
ACCOMPLISH THAT AS WE GO

01:16:40.896 --> 01:16:43.532
FORWARD. AND YOUR ARE YOU

01:16:43.598 --> 01:16:46.168
CONCRETELY LOOKING AT POTENTIAL

01:16:46.234 --> 01:16:48.103
CHANGES TO THE BILL TO MAKE SURE

01:16:48.170 --> 01:16:49.638
THOSE THINGS HAPPEN BEFORE IT

01:16:49.705 --> 01:16:52.607
GETS TO THE FLOOR? YES, WE I

01:16:52.674 --> 01:16:54.009
KNOW WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS

01:16:54.076 --> 01:16:56.378
ABOUT THEM AS WELL AS THE CHAIR

01:16:56.445 --> 01:16:58.447
OF CNC, ABOUT ABOUT SOME SOME

01:16:58.513 --> 01:17:00.882
FRAMEWORKS TO ACCOMPLISH THAT. I

01:17:00.949 --> 01:17:02.651
THINK, YOU KNOW, I GAVE THE

01:17:02.718 --> 01:17:03.552
HOUSING EXAMPLE. THE ADVANTAGE

01:17:03.618 --> 01:17:05.354
THAT WE HAVE HERE IS THAT IT'S

01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:07.089
NOT IT'S NOT A MILLION PEOPLE IN

01:17:07.155 --> 01:17:08.023
THE MARKET. IT'S, YOU KNOW, IT'S

01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:10.892
A IT'S A HANDFUL OF COMPANIES.

01:17:10.959 --> 01:17:11.526
SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT SIMPLER.

01:17:11.593 --> 01:17:12.694
BUT IT'S STILL IS THAT

01:17:12.761 --> 01:17:14.196
CHALLENGE. SO I THINK THERE ARE

01:17:14.262 --> 01:17:15.464
THE BOTH COMMITTEES AND OTHERS

01:17:15.530 --> 01:17:16.965
HAVE HAVE COME UP WITH A COUPLE

01:17:17.032 --> 01:17:18.834
OF FRAMEWORKS THAT ARE IN THAT

01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:19.901
KIND OF A LOOK BACK POINT OF

01:17:19.968 --> 01:17:22.137
VIEW. TELL US, DID WE, DID THEY

01:17:22.204 --> 01:17:24.272
DID THEY DO WHAT THEY SAID THAT

01:17:24.339 --> 01:17:24.806
WOULD HAPPEN? I'M PRETTY

01:17:24.873 --> 01:17:26.875
CONFIDENT BECAUSE THE ECONOMICS,

01:17:26.942 --> 01:17:27.876
THE ECONOMIC INCENTIVES ARE

01:17:27.943 --> 01:17:29.444
ALIGNED EXACTLY RIGHT, THAT, YOU

01:17:29.511 --> 01:17:31.513
KNOW, THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE

01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:32.147
EXPERIENCING THE CHALLENGES OF

01:17:32.214 --> 01:17:34.716
THEIR MARKET. SO THEIR ABSOLUTE

01:17:34.783 --> 01:17:36.585
INTEREST IS FOR FARES TO BE

01:17:36.651 --> 01:17:38.687
LOWER AND FOR RIDERS TO WANT TO

01:17:38.754 --> 01:17:40.655
DRIVE. SO I THINK IN THIS CASE,

01:17:40.722 --> 01:17:42.791
WE ARE IN A PLACE WHERE, WHERE,

01:17:42.858 --> 01:17:43.692
WHERE OUR INTERESTS ARE ALIGNED.

01:17:43.759 --> 01:17:45.260
BUT BUT YES, WE'VE BEEN LOOKING

01:17:45.327 --> 01:17:46.695
AT SOME OTHER FRAMEWORKS THAT

01:17:46.762 --> 01:17:48.196
HAVE BEEN KIND OF FLOATED HERE

01:17:48.263 --> 01:17:49.197
IN THE ASSEMBLY AND ABSOLUTELY

01:17:49.264 --> 01:17:51.400
COMMITTED TO, TO IF WE CAN LAND

01:17:51.466 --> 01:17:53.535
ON ONE TO MAKE SURE IT'S IN THE

01:17:53.602 --> 01:17:55.137
BILL AS WELL. I APPRECIATE THAT

01:17:55.203 --> 01:17:58.407
I AGAIN I, I'M, I LOVE YOUR

01:17:58.473 --> 01:17:59.674
FOCUS ON AFFORDABILITY AND

01:17:59.741 --> 01:18:02.844
WANTING TO IMPROVE RATES FOR

01:18:02.911 --> 01:18:04.413
DRIVERS AS WELL AS INCREASE

01:18:04.479 --> 01:18:06.448
FARES FOR CUSTOMERS. I STRUGGLE

01:18:06.515 --> 01:18:08.850
WITH THE LACK OF CONCRETENESS IN

01:18:08.917 --> 01:18:11.420
THE BILL THAT IN TERMS OF THOSE

01:18:11.486 --> 01:18:12.854
PARTICULAR PIECES, I'M GOING TO

01:18:12.921 --> 01:18:15.190
SUPPORT IT TODAY, WOULD REALLY

01:18:15.257 --> 01:18:17.159
BE LOOKING FOR THOSE. AS THIS

01:18:17.225 --> 01:18:18.560
MOVES TOWARDS THE FLOOR, I'M

01:18:18.627 --> 01:18:19.828
ASSUMING THAT IT'S GOING TO MOVE

01:18:19.895 --> 01:18:22.230
TO THE FLOOR, BUT REALLY BE

01:18:22.297 --> 01:18:24.533
LOOKING FOR MORE CONCRETE THINGS

01:18:24.599 --> 01:18:26.134
IN THIS THAT WILL PROVIDE THOSE

01:18:26.201 --> 01:18:28.503
KINDS OF GUARANTEES, BUT WANT TO

01:18:28.570 --> 01:18:29.971
HELP YOU GET IT OUT OF

01:18:30.038 --> 01:18:31.106
COMMITTEE. I THINK YOU'VE GOT A

01:18:31.173 --> 01:18:32.240
SUPPORTIVE COMMITTEE HERE AND

01:18:32.307 --> 01:18:34.643
IT'S GOING TO GET OUT ANYWAY,

01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:35.277
BUT WOULD LIKE TO SUPPORT YOU

01:18:35.343 --> 01:18:37.112
TODAY AND THEN BE LOOKING FOR

01:18:37.179 --> 01:18:38.480
THOSE THINGS. THANK YOU, VICE

01:18:38.547 --> 01:18:40.549
CHAIR WALLACE. THANK YOU, MADAM

01:18:40.615 --> 01:18:42.217
CHAIR. SENATOR, I APPRECIATE YOU

01:18:42.284 --> 01:18:43.585
BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. WHEN

01:18:43.652 --> 01:18:44.986
I WAS GROWING UP, YOU KNOW, WE

01:18:45.053 --> 01:18:47.089
WERE TAUGHT AS KIDS NOT TO GET

01:18:47.155 --> 01:18:49.291
IN STRANGERS CARS AND NOT TO

01:18:49.357 --> 01:18:51.159
MEET PEOPLE, STRANGERS FROM THE

01:18:51.226 --> 01:18:51.860
INTERNET. AND NOW WE'RE

01:18:51.927 --> 01:18:52.994
LITERALLY SUMMONING STRANGERS

01:18:53.061 --> 01:18:54.129
FROM THE INTERNET TO GET INTO

01:18:54.196 --> 01:18:56.798
THEIR CARS. SO, YOU KNOW, I

01:18:56.865 --> 01:18:58.066
APPRECIATE THAT. WELL, TIMES

01:18:58.133 --> 01:18:59.701
CHANGE, SO SHOULD POLICY. AND

01:18:59.768 --> 01:19:01.069
THAT'S THE APPROACH I THINK

01:19:01.136 --> 01:19:02.971
YOU'RE TAKING HERE. YOU KNOW, I,

01:19:03.038 --> 01:19:04.039
I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS

01:19:04.106 --> 01:19:05.774
BILL. I WAS SUPPORTIVE OF IT

01:19:05.841 --> 01:19:07.109
BEFORE TAKING THE COMMITTEE

01:19:07.175 --> 01:19:08.510
AMENDS. BUT I DO APPRECIATE YOU

01:19:08.577 --> 01:19:10.078
TAKING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS

01:19:10.145 --> 01:19:10.912
AND WORKING WITH OUR GROUP HERE

01:19:10.979 --> 01:19:12.614
IN INSURANCE. I DO THINK THAT

01:19:12.681 --> 01:19:14.916
YOU'VE HIT SORT OF THE CRUX OF

01:19:14.983 --> 01:19:16.585
THE ISSUE HERE. HOW DO WE GET

01:19:16.651 --> 01:19:18.120
LOWER FARES FOR RIDERS AND HOW

01:19:18.186 --> 01:19:19.287
DO WE GET MORE MONEY IN DRIVERS

01:19:19.354 --> 01:19:20.989
POCKETS? AND SO I APPRECIATE

01:19:21.056 --> 01:19:22.157
YOUR WORK ON THIS AND JUST

01:19:22.224 --> 01:19:23.959
LOOKING FORWARD TO SUPPORTING

01:19:24.025 --> 01:19:24.993
THE BILL. I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE

01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:26.027
BILL WHEN APPROPRIATE. THANK

01:19:26.094 --> 01:19:28.530
YOU. OKAY. ASSEMBLYWOMAN ÁVILA

01:19:28.597 --> 01:19:32.534
FARÍAS THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR.

01:19:32.601 --> 01:19:33.869
SENATOR, I ALWAYS LOOK FORWARD

01:19:33.935 --> 01:19:35.804
TO YOUR PRESENTATIONS BECAUSE

01:19:35.871 --> 01:19:38.206
THE ONE THING WE HAVE IN COMMON

01:19:38.273 --> 01:19:39.541
IS AFFORDABILITY OF HOUSING

01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:41.510
POLICY. AND SO WE'RE JUST WIRED

01:19:41.576 --> 01:19:42.777
A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY AROUND

01:19:42.844 --> 01:19:45.046
PUBLIC POLICY. AND SO WHEN I SAW

01:19:45.113 --> 01:19:46.781
THIS BILL, I KNEW THAT THERE WAS

01:19:46.848 --> 01:19:48.917
A LOT OF THOUGHTFUL THINKING

01:19:48.984 --> 01:19:52.888
BEHIND IT TO ASSURE A BALANCE

01:19:52.954 --> 01:19:55.357
FOR CONSUMERS. AND ALSO THE UBER

01:19:55.423 --> 01:19:57.959
DRIVERS. AND SO I FEEL THIS

01:19:58.026 --> 01:20:00.262
BILL, DOES THAT CREATE THAT

01:20:00.328 --> 01:20:01.796
BALANCE THROUGH REDUCING

01:20:01.863 --> 01:20:04.399
EXCESSIVE COSTS FOR THE DRIVERS

01:20:04.466 --> 01:20:05.901
AND THEN AT THE SAME TIME,

01:20:05.967 --> 01:20:07.702
PROTECTING CONSUMERS, WHICH I

01:20:07.769 --> 01:20:10.305
KNOW ALL OF US HAVE A VESTED

01:20:10.372 --> 01:20:11.907
INTEREST IN. BUT MOST

01:20:11.973 --> 01:20:13.542
IMPORTANTLY, YOU KNOW, WE AT THE

01:20:13.608 --> 01:20:14.876
BEGINNING OF THE YEAR AND THE

01:20:14.943 --> 01:20:16.411
LEGISLATURE ON THE FLOOR

01:20:16.478 --> 01:20:17.913
COMMITTED TO MAKING CALIFORNIA

01:20:17.979 --> 01:20:19.814
MORE AFFORDABLE. AND THIS IS

01:20:19.881 --> 01:20:21.683
REALLY IN THE SPIRIT OF, YOU

01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:24.452
KNOW, KEEPING AFFORDABILITY AND

01:20:24.519 --> 01:20:26.354
ACCESSIBILITY, WHICH ARE EQUALLY

01:20:26.421 --> 01:20:29.457
IMPORTANT. AND IT'S SMART, FAIR,

01:20:29.524 --> 01:20:31.193
UPDATED POLICY THAT I THINK THAT

01:20:31.259 --> 01:20:32.928
YOU ARE LOOKING THROUGH THAT

01:20:32.994 --> 01:20:35.864
LENS. AND I AND I DO SEE JOBS

01:20:35.931 --> 01:20:37.132
HERE, YOU KNOW, AS SOMEONE WHO'S

01:20:37.199 --> 01:20:40.001
BEEN IN A LABOR SPACE, ALL OF MY

01:20:40.068 --> 01:20:43.104
PUBLIC SERVICE CAREER AND A

01:20:43.171 --> 01:20:44.773
MEMBER, THE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY

01:20:44.839 --> 01:20:47.309
THAT I SEE HERE FOR OUR MEMBERS

01:20:47.375 --> 01:20:49.644
IS EVERY TIME I JUMP IN AN UBER,

01:20:49.711 --> 01:20:51.980
I ALWAYS ASK IN OUR LONG CHAT

01:20:52.047 --> 01:20:53.782
WHETHER IT'S AN AIRPORT DRIVE,

01:20:53.848 --> 01:20:55.150
IS THIS YOUR FULL TIME JOB? OR

01:20:55.217 --> 01:20:57.085
WHAT DO YOU DO? AND THE

01:20:57.152 --> 01:20:59.020
MAJORITY, IT'S THEIR SECOND JOB

01:20:59.087 --> 01:21:01.389
THAT THEY UTILIZE TO SUPPLEMENT

01:21:01.456 --> 01:21:04.159
THEIR INCOME TO, YOU KNOW, DEAL

01:21:04.226 --> 01:21:06.628
WITH THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING IN

01:21:06.695 --> 01:21:09.130
CALIFORNIA. AND SO I HAVE YET TO

01:21:09.197 --> 01:21:11.132
JUMP INTO A CAR WHERE THEY ARE

01:21:11.199 --> 01:21:12.767
NOT APPRECIATIVE OF THE

01:21:12.834 --> 01:21:14.636
OPPORTUNITY, THE ECONOMIC JOB

01:21:14.703 --> 01:21:15.804
OPPORTUNITY THAT THEY'RE BEING

01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:17.405
PROVIDED BY THE UBER

01:21:17.472 --> 01:21:19.274
ORGANIZATION. AND SO AS A

01:21:19.341 --> 01:21:21.776
LEGISLATOR, YOU KNOW, OUR JOB IS

01:21:21.843 --> 01:21:23.578
TO CREATE THAT ECONOMIC

01:21:23.645 --> 01:21:24.980
OPPORTUNITY SPACE. AND I THINK

01:21:25.046 --> 01:21:27.315
UBER DOES THAT. AND I THINK

01:21:27.382 --> 01:21:29.384
AGAIN, YOUR POLICY IS STRIKING A

01:21:29.451 --> 01:21:31.019
BALANCE HERE. SO THANK YOU FOR

01:21:31.086 --> 01:21:32.020
BRINGING IT FORWARD. AND I'LL BE

01:21:32.087 --> 01:21:34.256
SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY AS

01:21:34.322 --> 01:21:36.758
WELL. ASSEMBLYMAN HERB, THANK

01:21:41.896 --> 01:21:43.064
AND OBVIOUSLY THE OPPOSITION AS

01:21:43.131 --> 01:21:44.966
WELL FOR BEING HERE. AND I WANT

01:21:45.033 --> 01:21:47.535
TO JUST GO BACK QUICKLY TO THE

01:21:47.602 --> 01:21:48.870
OPPOSITION. SIR, THE ISSUE THAT

01:21:48.937 --> 01:21:50.572
YOU HAD TALKED ABOUT IS AND I

01:21:50.639 --> 01:21:52.574
WANT TO MAKE SURE I'M GETTING

01:21:52.641 --> 01:21:53.108
THIS RIGHT, IS SOMEHOW THE

01:21:53.174 --> 01:21:56.778
DRIVERS DON'T AUTOMATICALLY GET

01:21:56.845 --> 01:21:58.313
TO TAKE PART IN THIS INSURANCE

01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:01.516
POLICY. POLICY. THE YOU BECAUSE

01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:02.917
OF I THINK YOU JUST DESCRIBED A

01:22:02.984 --> 01:22:05.020
BASIC SUBROGATION ISSUE. AND I

01:22:05.086 --> 01:22:07.188
JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I'M NOT

01:22:07.255 --> 01:22:08.023
MISSING SOMETHING. ARE YOU ARE

01:22:08.089 --> 01:22:09.658
YOU ASKING FOR AN AMENDMENT THAT

01:22:09.724 --> 01:22:11.493
WOULD THAT WOULD BASICALLY GO

01:22:11.559 --> 01:22:13.261
AROUND SUBROGATION RULES UNDER

01:22:13.328 --> 01:22:15.797
THE EXISTING INSURANCE POLICIES

01:22:15.864 --> 01:22:17.932
AND LAWS IN CALIFORNIA? OR IS IT

01:22:17.999 --> 01:22:18.566
SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

01:22:18.633 --> 01:22:19.734
THAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR?

01:22:19.801 --> 01:22:20.902
SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT?

01:22:20.969 --> 01:22:22.337
OKAY. SO WHAT EXACTLY WHAT

01:22:22.404 --> 01:22:23.805
EXACTLY ARE YOU ARE YOU SAYING

01:22:23.872 --> 01:22:25.440
IS NOT IN THIS BILL? THAT SHOULD

01:22:25.507 --> 01:22:27.275
BE THE AMENDMENT THAT WE WOULD

01:22:27.342 --> 01:22:30.879
BE SEEKING WOULD BE THAT IF THE

01:22:30.945 --> 01:22:33.415
RIDER HAD THEIR OWN POLICY THAT

01:22:33.481 --> 01:22:35.750
HAD COVERAGE. I'M SORRY. LET ME

01:22:35.817 --> 01:22:38.586
START OVER. IF THERE WAS AN AT

01:22:38.653 --> 01:22:40.155
FAULT PARTY WHO HAD COVERAGE AND

01:22:40.221 --> 01:22:42.457
THERE WERE PAYMENTS MADE BY THAT

01:22:42.524 --> 01:22:44.659
PARTY, THAT ANY PAYMENTS MADE BY

01:22:44.726 --> 01:22:46.695
THAT PARTY WOULD NOT SERVE AS

01:22:46.761 --> 01:22:48.963
ANY SORT OF A SET OFF FOR THE

01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:51.566
COVERAGE PROVIDED IN THE UIM

01:22:51.633 --> 01:22:53.268
UNDER THE NEW LIMITS. SO, FOR

01:22:53.335 --> 01:22:55.003
EXAMPLE, IF THERE WAS AN AT

01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:56.738
FAULT PARTY WHO HAD A MINIMUM

01:22:56.805 --> 01:22:59.374
INSURED A $30,000 POLICY, THE

01:22:59.441 --> 01:23:00.408
PERSON SUFFERED A BROKEN ARM,

01:23:00.475 --> 01:23:01.776
HAD TO HAVE SURGERY, MISSED WORK

01:23:01.843 --> 01:23:04.279
FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS, AND THAT

01:23:04.346 --> 01:23:06.614
FAULT PARTY'S INSURER PAID THE

01:23:06.681 --> 01:23:09.417
$30,000. THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE

01:23:09.484 --> 01:23:10.885
UNDERINSURED COVERAGE AVAILABLE

01:23:10.952 --> 01:23:12.554
UNDER THE UBER POLICY WOULD THEN

01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:14.189
STILL BE AVAILABLE. IT WOULDN'T

01:23:14.255 --> 01:23:16.925
JUST BE $70,000, BECAUSE $30,000

01:23:16.991 --> 01:23:18.827
HAD ALREADY BEEN PAID BY THE AT

01:23:18.893 --> 01:23:19.961
FAULT PARTY'S INSURER. I

01:23:20.028 --> 01:23:21.429
UNDERSTAND IS THAT CURRENT SET

01:23:21.496 --> 01:23:23.365
OFF IN UNDER THE CURRENT LIMITS,

01:23:23.431 --> 01:23:25.300
THERE'S A SET OFF, THERE IS A

01:23:25.367 --> 01:23:27.102
SET OFF FOR ANY PAYMENTS MADE AT

01:23:27.168 --> 01:23:28.236
FAULT IN ANY INSURANCE. YEAH,

01:23:28.303 --> 01:23:29.838
OKAY, I APPRECIATE IT. JUST

01:23:29.904 --> 01:23:31.806
WANTED TO CLARIFY. THANK YOU.

01:23:31.873 --> 01:23:34.843
OKAY. ASSEMBLYMAN ALVAREZ, THANK

01:23:34.909 --> 01:23:36.845
YOU. APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION.

01:23:36.911 --> 01:23:39.647
IT PRESENTS AN INTERESTING

01:23:39.714 --> 01:23:41.049
APPROACH, WHICH I'M CERTAINLY

01:23:41.116 --> 01:23:42.650
INTERESTED IN HEARING MORE

01:23:42.717 --> 01:23:44.586
ABOUT. BUT I WANT TO ASK ABOUT

01:23:44.652 --> 01:23:47.922
THE IN OUR ANALYSIS, YOU

01:23:47.989 --> 01:23:50.925
IDENTIFY A STUDY WHICH TALKS

01:23:50.992 --> 01:23:52.627
ABOUT THE PERCENTAGE OF CLAIMS

01:23:52.694 --> 01:23:57.031
THAT ARE WOULD BE SETTLED UNDER

01:23:57.098 --> 01:24:02.303
50,000, 100,000 LIMITS. WHAT WHO

01:24:02.370 --> 01:24:06.374
CONDUCTED THIS STUDY AND IS THAT

01:24:06.441 --> 01:24:10.378
DATA AVAILABLE? I BELIEVE YOU'RE

01:24:10.445 --> 01:24:11.746
REFERRING TO THE BRG STUDY,

01:24:11.813 --> 01:24:13.014
BERKELEY RESEARCH GROUP. THAT

01:24:13.081 --> 01:24:15.350
WAS THE INDUSTRY STUDY THAT WE

01:24:15.417 --> 01:24:17.185
COMMISSIONED THIS YEAR. IT MAY

01:24:17.252 --> 01:24:18.686
BE WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO. A

01:24:18.753 --> 01:24:20.488
STUDY THAT'S IN OUR ANALYSIS

01:24:20.555 --> 01:24:22.490
DOESN'T NAME IT AND SECTION OF

01:24:22.557 --> 01:24:24.426
THE ANALYSIS. SO WE CAN PROVIDE

01:24:24.492 --> 01:24:27.529
THAT. OKAY. SO IN YOUR IN THIS

01:24:27.595 --> 01:24:32.567
STUDY YOU ANALYZE EXISTING LIKE

01:24:32.634 --> 01:24:33.668
HISTORICAL TRENDS. AND THAT'S

01:24:33.735 --> 01:24:36.237
HOW THIS PERCENTAGE WAS ARRIVED

01:24:36.304 --> 01:24:39.340
TO OKAY. AND THAT WAS ORIGINALLY

01:24:39.407 --> 01:24:41.576
IN THE BILL. THE AMENDMENTS

01:24:41.643 --> 01:24:44.012
WHICH I UNDERSTAND ARE BEING

01:24:44.078 --> 01:24:46.748
TAKEN RAISE THOSE LIMITS. WHAT

01:24:46.815 --> 01:24:48.950
ARE THE NEW LIMITS DO IN TERMS

01:24:49.017 --> 01:24:50.218
OF THE PERCENTAGE OF COVERAGE,

01:24:50.285 --> 01:24:53.555
IF YOU WILL, OF INCIDENTS

01:24:53.621 --> 01:24:55.356
COMPARED TO THE 60% OF CLAIMS

01:24:55.423 --> 01:24:57.792
UNDER THE PREVIOUS 50,000

01:24:57.859 --> 01:25:01.095
100,000 LIMITS? SO YOU'RE ASKING

01:25:01.162 --> 01:25:03.932
HOW MUCH? I'M SORRY. HOW MANY

01:25:03.998 --> 01:25:05.567
CLAIMS WOULD NOW HOW MANY MORE

01:25:05.633 --> 01:25:07.669
IS HOW I INTERPRET THAT? THAT'S

01:25:07.735 --> 01:25:09.337
RIGHT. WE CAN GET BACK TO YOUR

01:25:09.404 --> 01:25:11.573
OFFICE ON THAT AND HAVE THAT

01:25:11.639 --> 01:25:13.475
INFORMATION FOR YOU. OKAY. AND

01:25:13.541 --> 01:25:15.944
WORTH FLAGGING IF AM I, IF I'M

01:25:16.010 --> 01:25:17.645
ALLOWED TO SHARE. WE HAD

01:25:17.712 --> 01:25:20.281
CONDUCTED A STUDY WITH OUR

01:25:20.348 --> 01:25:21.249
UNDERWRITER, OUR STATE

01:25:21.316 --> 01:25:22.417
UNDERWRITER, JUST OUR COMPANY ON

01:25:22.484 --> 01:25:24.118
WHAT WOULD BE SUFFICIENT, LIKE

01:25:24.185 --> 01:25:26.354
WHAT, 5100 WAS NOT PULLED OUT OF

01:25:26.421 --> 01:25:28.122
THE SKY. AND I THINK IT'S

01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:29.557
WONDERFUL THAT WE'RE HAVING THE

01:25:29.624 --> 01:25:31.159
OPPORTUNITY TO DEBATE IT TODAY,

01:25:31.226 --> 01:25:31.926
AND I'M VERY THANKFUL FOR THAT.

01:25:31.993 --> 01:25:33.862
BUT THAT THAT STUDY, WE WILL

01:25:33.928 --> 01:25:35.697
ALSO BE HAPPY TO SHARE WITH YOU

01:25:35.763 --> 01:25:39.601
THE 5100 BEING COMPARED TO

01:25:39.667 --> 01:25:41.836
ACCIDENTS FOR PERSONAL DRIVERS,

01:25:41.903 --> 01:25:45.106
YOU OR I INDIVIDUALLY NOT TNCS

01:25:45.173 --> 01:25:49.410
WOULD COVER 96% OF UIM CLAIMS

01:25:49.477 --> 01:25:50.745
TODAY FOR INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE

01:25:50.812 --> 01:25:52.213
DIFFERENT THAN COMPANIES, THE

01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:53.248
CLAIMS FOR COMPANIES, ACCORDING

01:25:53.314 --> 01:25:55.083
TO OUR UNDERWRITER ARE OFTEN 10

01:25:55.149 --> 01:25:57.151
TO 12 TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE ON

01:25:57.218 --> 01:25:58.987
UIM CLAIMS, BUT WE WOULD BE

01:25:59.053 --> 01:26:01.289
HAPPY TO SEND THE BRG STUDY AND

01:26:01.356 --> 01:26:02.690
OUR AND OUR OUTSIDE STUDY AS

01:26:02.757 --> 01:26:04.425
WELL. OKAY, I DEFINITELY WOULD

01:26:04.492 --> 01:26:06.561
BE INTERESTED IN THAT. NOW MORE

01:26:06.628 --> 01:26:08.429
FROM A USER PERSPECTIVE AS THIS

01:26:08.496 --> 01:26:10.265
AFFORDABILITY FOR, YOU KNOW, ON

01:26:10.331 --> 01:26:12.166
MULTIPLE LEVELS AS A USER PULLED

01:26:12.233 --> 01:26:15.203
UP A VERY RECENT TRIP THAT I

01:26:15.270 --> 01:26:16.738
TOOK, AND I'M CURIOUS WHERE

01:26:16.804 --> 01:26:19.541
THERE ARE SEVERAL FEES THAT UBER

01:26:19.607 --> 01:26:23.144
CHARGES TO THE USER, WHERE WOULD

01:26:23.211 --> 01:26:27.048
A DISCOUNTED FARE OR DISCOUNTED

01:26:27.115 --> 01:26:29.150
AS A RESULT OF THIS BILL? WHERE

01:26:29.217 --> 01:26:31.052
WOULD THAT BE REFLECTED IN THE

01:26:31.119 --> 01:26:32.186
MULTIPLE FEES THAT I HAVE

01:26:32.253 --> 01:26:34.322
LISTED? WOULD THAT BE IN THE

01:26:34.389 --> 01:26:35.957
BOOKING FEE? I ASSUME IT WOULD

01:26:36.024 --> 01:26:37.292
NOT BE IN THE DRIVER BENEFITS

01:26:37.358 --> 01:26:39.227
FEE. WHEN YOU GO TO AN AIRPORT,

01:26:39.294 --> 01:26:40.128
AIRPORTS HAVE THEIR OWN FEE.

01:26:40.194 --> 01:26:41.996
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.

01:26:42.063 --> 01:26:44.032
THERE'S A REGULATORY FEE AND

01:26:44.098 --> 01:26:45.033
THERE'S A SOMETHING CALLED AN

01:26:45.099 --> 01:26:46.834
ACCESS FEE, AND THEN THERE'S THE

01:26:46.901 --> 01:26:48.369
ACTUAL FARE. YEAH. SO WHERE

01:26:48.436 --> 01:26:51.172
WOULD I SEE A REDUCTION IN MY

01:26:51.239 --> 01:26:53.775
FARE? GREAT QUESTION. SO THE

01:26:53.841 --> 01:26:54.976
REGULATORY FEES AND THE ACCESS

01:26:55.043 --> 01:26:57.011
FOR ALL FEES, THOSE ARE A RESULT

01:26:57.078 --> 01:26:58.413
OF STATE LEGISLATION. BUT OUR

01:26:58.479 --> 01:27:00.014
INSURANCE FEES TODAY ARE

01:27:00.081 --> 01:27:01.649
CAPTURED IN THE BOOKING FEE. SO

01:27:01.716 --> 01:27:04.152
WE ARE TRANSPARENT PER TRIP ON

01:27:04.218 --> 01:27:05.386
GOVERNMENT MANDATED INSURANCE.

01:27:05.453 --> 01:27:06.821
AND WHAT THOSE COSTS ARE WHERE

01:27:06.888 --> 01:27:08.022
YOU WILL SEE A DIFFERENCE. AND

01:27:08.089 --> 01:27:10.124
IF YOU WERE TO COMPARE A

01:27:10.191 --> 01:27:11.526
RECEIPT, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU

01:27:11.593 --> 01:27:13.061
WENT TO SPRING TRAINING IN

01:27:13.127 --> 01:27:14.295
ARIZONA AND YOU'RE BOOKING FEE

01:27:14.362 --> 01:27:15.697
IN ARIZONA VERSUS CALIFORNIA, OR

01:27:15.763 --> 01:27:16.297
FOR EXAMPLE, IN BOSTON, WHERE

01:27:16.364 --> 01:27:18.900
IT'S A 10TH OF THE COST OF OUR

01:27:18.967 --> 01:27:20.034
INSURANCE HERE, THE BOOKING FEE

01:27:20.101 --> 01:27:22.370
WILL BE THE PLACE WHERE THOSE

01:27:22.437 --> 01:27:23.304
SAVINGS ARE REFLECTED AND WILL

01:27:23.371 --> 01:27:25.740
BE CAPTURED, TOO, BY ELEMENTS OF

01:27:25.807 --> 01:27:27.475
THE STUDY BEING PROPOSED IN THE

01:27:27.542 --> 01:27:29.210
AMENDMENTS TODAY. WOULD YOU BE

01:27:29.277 --> 01:27:30.044
WILLING TO PROVIDE WHAT THE

01:27:30.111 --> 01:27:31.846
BREAKDOWN OF THE BOOKING FEE IS

01:27:31.913 --> 01:27:34.716
PER STATE REGULATION TO US?

01:27:34.782 --> 01:27:36.551
GLADLY, AND IDENTIFY

01:27:36.618 --> 01:27:37.652
SPECIFICALLY WHERE THE INSURANCE

01:27:37.719 --> 01:27:39.454
FEE, WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THAT FEE

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:41.289
IS DUE TO INSURANCE? YEAH. NO

01:27:41.356 --> 01:27:43.124
PROBLEM. OKAY. AND I WOULD JUST

01:27:43.191 --> 01:27:44.926
ADD THAT, YOU KNOW, I'M UPSET

01:27:44.993 --> 01:27:45.827
THAT YOU WEREN'T LOOKING AT A

01:27:45.893 --> 01:27:48.062
LYFT RECEIPT, BUT AT THE SAME AT

01:27:48.129 --> 01:27:50.598
THE SAME TIME, WE HAVE AN

01:27:50.665 --> 01:27:52.000
EARNINGS GUARANTEE FOR OUR

01:27:52.066 --> 01:27:54.202
DRIVERS. SO AFTER EXTERNAL FEES

01:27:54.268 --> 01:27:56.104
AND GOVERNMENT MANDATED

01:27:56.170 --> 01:27:59.207
INSURANCE, 70% OF RIDE FARES GO

01:27:59.273 --> 01:28:01.476
TO OUR DRIVERS. AND WE GUARANTEE

01:28:01.542 --> 01:28:02.944
THAT. AND WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT

01:28:03.011 --> 01:28:04.646
FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. SO

01:28:04.712 --> 01:28:06.614
IF THERE WERE TO BE ANY SAVINGS,

01:28:06.681 --> 01:28:08.349
THEY WOULD BE ON THE EXTERNAL

01:28:08.416 --> 01:28:09.884
FEES AND INSURANCE, AND THAT POT

01:28:09.951 --> 01:28:11.986
OF THAT POT OF MONEY WOULD

01:28:12.053 --> 01:28:13.921
REDUCE AND IT WOULD GO TO THE

01:28:13.988 --> 01:28:15.490
DRIVERS. SO WE'RE WE'RE TALKING

01:28:15.556 --> 01:28:17.925
ABOUT THE, THE FEES BEFORE

01:28:17.992 --> 01:28:19.727
THERE'S THE TAKE RATE FROM TO

01:28:19.794 --> 01:28:21.329
THE DRIVERS AND TO US. RIGHT.

01:28:21.396 --> 01:28:24.032
AND SO IF WE WERE TO REDUCE

01:28:24.098 --> 01:28:26.601
INSURANCE COSTS THEN THOSE FEES

01:28:26.668 --> 01:28:28.236
WOULD GO DOWN AND THE POOL OF

01:28:28.302 --> 01:28:30.104
MONEY AVAILABLE TO DRIVERS WOULD

01:28:30.171 --> 01:28:31.739
GO UP. YOU MIGHT HAVE LOST ME A

01:28:31.806 --> 01:28:33.841
LITTLE BIT. SO I UNDERSTAND WHAT

01:28:33.908 --> 01:28:36.244
YOU MOST OF WHAT YOU SAID. BUT

01:28:36.310 --> 01:28:37.545
NOW TALKING ABOUT DRIVERS,

01:28:37.612 --> 01:28:38.780
BECAUSE THIS WAS ALSO SOMETHING

01:28:38.846 --> 01:28:39.881
THAT WAS MENTIONED AND

01:28:39.947 --> 01:28:41.215
APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR CONCERNED

01:28:41.282 --> 01:28:43.217
BOTH ABOUT CONSUMERS AND THOSE

01:28:43.284 --> 01:28:47.655
WHO PROVIDE THE SERVICE. SO THEN

01:28:47.722 --> 01:28:51.392
WE WOULD ANTICIPATE THAT THE

01:28:51.459 --> 01:28:54.262
OUTSIDE OF ALL THESE OTHER FEES,

01:28:54.328 --> 01:28:57.598
THERE WOULD BE SOME BENEFIT TO

01:28:57.665 --> 01:28:58.733
DRIVERS. THEY SHOULD ANTICIPATE

01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:01.469
SOME BENEFIT TO THEM. IF IT'S A

01:29:01.536 --> 01:29:02.837
7030 SPLIT. ARE YOU TALKING

01:29:02.904 --> 01:29:05.173
ABOUT THE 7030 SPLIT CHANGING OR

01:29:05.239 --> 01:29:06.941
WHAT WOULD THEY EXPECT? NO. SO

01:29:07.008 --> 01:29:08.676
SORRY IF I DIDN'T IF I WASN'T

01:29:08.743 --> 01:29:10.611
CLEAR ENOUGH. SO AFTER EXTERNAL

01:29:10.678 --> 01:29:12.080
FEES. SO THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE

01:29:12.146 --> 01:29:14.082
TALKING ABOUT AS FAR AS AIRPORT

01:29:14.148 --> 01:29:15.850
FEES, GROSS RECEIPTS, TAXES,

01:29:15.917 --> 01:29:18.886
PROP 22 FEES. NOW THE CPUC CLEAN

01:29:18.953 --> 01:29:21.122
MILES FEE. SO INSURANCE. CALL

01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:23.491
YOUR TRIP FARE. I'M SORRY, WOULD

01:29:23.558 --> 01:29:24.692
YOU WOULD YOU CALL YOUR TRIP

01:29:24.759 --> 01:29:26.160
FARE? IS WHAT YOU'RE TALKING

01:29:26.227 --> 01:29:28.129
ABOUT? YES YES, YES. SO AFTER

01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:30.598
FEES, THAT'S WHEN THE 7030

01:29:30.665 --> 01:29:32.433
SPLIT. SPLIT HAPPENS WITH OUR

01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:34.702
EARNINGS GUARANTEE. AND SO THE

01:29:34.769 --> 01:29:36.537
FEES BEFORE THAT SPLIT OCCURS

01:29:36.604 --> 01:29:38.172
WILL GO DOWN BECAUSE INSURANCE

01:29:38.239 --> 01:29:39.907
COSTS WILL GO DOWN. AND SO I

01:29:39.974 --> 01:29:41.709
UNDERSTAND THE FEES TO ME AS A

01:29:41.776 --> 01:29:42.977
CONSUMER WILL GO DOWN. I GOT

01:29:43.044 --> 01:29:44.312
THAT PART WE'RE TALKING ALSO

01:29:44.378 --> 01:29:46.581
ABOUT NOW THE DRIVERS

01:29:46.647 --> 01:29:47.915
THEMSELVES. RIGHT. WE'VE TALKED

01:29:47.982 --> 01:29:49.450
ABOUT THE BENEFITS TO THEM. SO

01:29:49.517 --> 01:29:50.885
WHERE WOULD WE BE ABLE TO

01:29:50.952 --> 01:29:52.553
IDENTIFY THE BENEFITS TO DRIVERS

01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:54.756
AS A RESULT OF THIS. SO IF THE

01:29:54.822 --> 01:29:56.557
IF THE IN THE LYFT SITUATION. SO

01:29:56.624 --> 01:29:59.293
IF THE FEE IF THE FEES GO DOWN

01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:03.765
BY BY $10 BY AUTOMATIC OPERATION

01:30:03.831 --> 01:30:05.600
OF THEIR OF THE FORMULA, THEN

01:30:05.666 --> 01:30:08.035
THE DRIVERS, THE DRIVER CAPTURES

01:30:08.102 --> 01:30:09.537
70% OF THAT AUTOMATICALLY

01:30:09.604 --> 01:30:11.506
WITHOUT ANY SEPARATE POLICY. BUT

01:30:11.572 --> 01:30:13.274
IN THE CASE OF UBER, THAT'S NOT

01:30:13.341 --> 01:30:15.309
IT SOUNDS THE WAY THAT THEY. SO

01:30:15.376 --> 01:30:17.078
RECEIPTS ARE HOW WE NAME

01:30:17.145 --> 01:30:18.412
INSURANCE IS A BIT DIFFERENT.

01:30:18.479 --> 01:30:21.549
BUT LET'S USE A TRIP TO LAX AND

01:30:21.616 --> 01:30:23.251
LET'S USE A ROUND NUMBER. IT'S

01:30:23.317 --> 01:30:24.819
$100 AND YOU OR I INDIVIDUALLY

01:30:24.886 --> 01:30:26.954
ARE DECIDING IF WE CAN AFFORD TO

01:30:27.021 --> 01:30:31.159
DO THAT. $45 OF THAT $100 TODAY

01:30:31.225 --> 01:30:32.627
GOES TO GOVERNMENT MANDATED

01:30:32.693 --> 01:30:34.729
INSURANCE. THE OCCUPATIONAL

01:30:34.796 --> 01:30:36.097
ACCIDENT INSURANCE I REFERENCED

01:30:36.164 --> 01:30:38.032
OR, EXCUSE ME, THE LIABILITY

01:30:38.099 --> 01:30:39.801
INSURANCE THAT I REFERENCED AND

01:30:39.867 --> 01:30:42.270
UIM REPRESENT A LARGE PORTION OF

01:30:42.336 --> 01:30:44.005
THAT, BRINGING DOWN UIM AND

01:30:44.071 --> 01:30:45.907
MAKING TRIPS MORE AFFORDABLE.

01:30:45.973 --> 01:30:48.075
LET'S SAY THERE'S IT'S $20 MORE

01:30:48.142 --> 01:30:49.443
AFFORDABLE. YOU OR I ARE QUICKER

01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:51.679
TO NOW GO ON THAT TRIP. THERE'S

01:30:51.746 --> 01:30:53.815
MORE DEMAND ALSO FROM RIDERS TO

01:30:53.881 --> 01:30:56.250
TAKE TRIPS SO DRIVERS HAVE

01:30:56.317 --> 01:30:58.085
ACCESS TO MORE WORK. THEY WILL

01:30:58.152 --> 01:30:59.754
NEVER HAVE TO CARRY THIS POLICY.

01:30:59.821 --> 01:31:01.756
A HEALTHY MARKETPLACE Tê IS

01:31:01.823 --> 01:31:03.124
INCUMBENT ON PEOPLE WILLING TO

01:31:03.191 --> 01:31:05.626
TAKE TRIPS, SO THERE ARE BOTH

01:31:05.693 --> 01:31:07.829
DIRECT BENEFITS AND MARKETPLACE

01:31:07.895 --> 01:31:09.797
BENEFITS FOR DRIVERS. AND I HEAR

01:31:09.864 --> 01:31:11.032
THE CRITIQUE ON WANTING THAT TO

01:31:11.098 --> 01:31:12.867
BE FORMALIZED IN LIKE THE

01:31:12.934 --> 01:31:14.302
SENATOR MENTIONED, WE ARE

01:31:14.368 --> 01:31:16.137
COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK

01:31:16.204 --> 01:31:16.938
WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND ALL OF

01:31:17.004 --> 01:31:19.140
YOU AND FIGURING OUT THE RIGHT

01:31:19.207 --> 01:31:20.107
WAYS TO DO THAT. OKAY. I THINK

01:31:20.174 --> 01:31:21.909
THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE PLACE TO

01:31:21.976 --> 01:31:24.745
CLOSE. I THINK CERTAINLY

01:31:24.812 --> 01:31:26.848
SENATORS HEARD ACROSS THE BOARD

01:31:26.914 --> 01:31:30.218
TRYING TO IDENTIFY HOW THIS IS

01:31:30.284 --> 01:31:31.986
GOING TO POSITIVELY IMPACT

01:31:32.053 --> 01:31:33.254
CONSUMERS IN A WAY THAT WE CAN.

01:31:33.321 --> 01:31:35.022
THOSE OF US THAT ARE CONSUMING

01:31:35.089 --> 01:31:37.391
THIS PRODUCT CAN FEEL IT. AND

01:31:37.458 --> 01:31:39.527
THOSE THOSE WHO ARE EMPLOYED

01:31:39.594 --> 01:31:43.164
ALSO HAVE THE BENEFIT, CERTAINLY

01:31:43.231 --> 01:31:44.198
APPRECIATIVE THAT THE GOAL IS

01:31:44.265 --> 01:31:45.633
MUTUAL THERE FOR BOTH OF THOSE.

01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:47.869
AND SO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY.

01:31:47.935 --> 01:31:49.604
BUT LOOKING FORWARD TO WHAT THAT

01:31:49.670 --> 01:31:51.639
ACTUALLY BECOMES BEFORE THIS

01:31:51.706 --> 01:31:55.710
GOES TO THE FLOOR. THANK YOU.

01:31:55.776 --> 01:31:59.347
ASSEMBLYMAN BERMAN. THANK YOU,

01:31:59.413 --> 01:32:00.915
MADAM CHAIR, AND THANK YOU TO

01:32:00.982 --> 01:32:02.450
THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THE

01:32:02.516 --> 01:32:04.085
BILL. AND I KIND OF WANT TO

01:32:04.151 --> 01:32:05.353
ALIGN MYSELF WITH WITH DIFFERENT

01:32:05.419 --> 01:32:06.787
POINTS THAT ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES

01:32:06.854 --> 01:32:07.922
HAVE MADE DURING THE

01:32:07.989 --> 01:32:09.790
CONVERSATION. I THINK, YOU KNOW,

01:32:09.857 --> 01:32:11.559
I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR

01:32:11.626 --> 01:32:12.860
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF LOWERING

01:32:12.927 --> 01:32:14.128
THE COST FOR CONSUMERS AND

01:32:14.195 --> 01:32:16.130
LOWERING THE COST OF DAILY

01:32:16.197 --> 01:32:17.465
LIVING IN CALIFORNIA, WHICH WE

01:32:17.531 --> 01:32:19.433
ALL, I THINK, IN A BIPARTISAN

01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:21.302
FASHION, AGREE IS A TOP PRIORITY

01:32:21.369 --> 01:32:23.204
FOR THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR

01:32:23.271 --> 01:32:25.273
AND IN FUTURE YEARS. I SO

01:32:25.339 --> 01:32:26.807
APPRECIATE THAT YOUR YOUR, YOU

01:32:26.874 --> 01:32:28.476
KNOW, SECONDARY FOCUS IS

01:32:28.542 --> 01:32:31.078
INCREASING BENEFITS FOR DRIVERS,

01:32:31.145 --> 01:32:33.114
INCREASING BENEFITS FOR GIG

01:32:33.180 --> 01:32:34.982
WORKERS, WHO ARE THE ONES WHO

01:32:35.049 --> 01:32:36.684
ARE GETTING OUT ON THE ROAD AND,

01:32:36.751 --> 01:32:37.985
AND, YOU KNOW, LITERALLY DRIVING

01:32:38.052 --> 01:32:38.986
THIS, THIS NEW ECONOMY THAT HAS

01:32:39.053 --> 01:32:40.855
SPRUNG UP IN CALIFORNIA AND

01:32:40.922 --> 01:32:42.089
EXPANDED TO OTHER PARTS OF THE

01:32:42.156 --> 01:32:43.291
COUNTRY AND THE WORLD. AND

01:32:43.357 --> 01:32:44.392
ASSEMBLY MEMBER ORTEGA

01:32:44.458 --> 01:32:46.193
REFERENCED THE BILL FOR GIG

01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:47.995
WORKERS, WHICH I'M PROUD TO BE A

01:32:48.062 --> 01:32:50.131
JOINT AUTHOR OF WITH ASSEMBLY

01:32:50.197 --> 01:32:51.299
MEMBER WIX. AND, YOU KNOW,

01:32:51.365 --> 01:32:52.767
THAT'S THAT'S I'D SAY THAT'S MY

01:32:52.833 --> 01:32:54.568
PRIMARY CONCERN. AND THEN ALSO

01:32:54.635 --> 01:32:56.237
REDUCING THE COST FOR CONSUMERS

01:32:56.304 --> 01:32:58.773
IS A IS A GREAT BENEFIT AS WELL.

01:32:58.839 --> 01:33:00.908
AND A SECONDARY KIND OF BENEFIT

01:33:00.975 --> 01:33:02.243
IN MY EYES. BUT IT'S RARE THIS

01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:04.078
DAY AND AGE WHERE YOU GET THE

01:33:04.145 --> 01:33:06.414
OPPORTUNITY TO DO BOTH AT THE

01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:07.448
SAME TIME. AND I THINK THAT'S A

01:33:07.515 --> 01:33:09.817
REALLY UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY AND

01:33:09.884 --> 01:33:11.352
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD

01:33:11.419 --> 01:33:12.887
EMBRACE. AND SO I'M HAPPY TO

01:33:12.954 --> 01:33:14.655
SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. ALSO

01:33:14.722 --> 01:33:15.957
LOOK FOR OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO

01:33:16.023 --> 01:33:19.160
DO THAT IN OTHER SECTORS OF OUR

01:33:19.226 --> 01:33:20.995
ECONOMY. I APPRECIATE THE

01:33:21.062 --> 01:33:22.396
QUESTIONS THAT ASSEMBLYMEMBER

01:33:22.463 --> 01:33:24.865
ALVAREZ WAS ASKING, AND I WOULD

01:33:24.932 --> 01:33:26.500
ENCOURAGE THE COMPANIES GET THAT

01:33:26.567 --> 01:33:29.003
DATA TO ALL OF US. YOU KNOW,

01:33:29.070 --> 01:33:30.471
DATA. I KNOW THAT THE ORIGINAL

01:33:30.538 --> 01:33:32.406
PROPOSAL WAS 1100. I ASSUME

01:33:32.473 --> 01:33:34.175
THERE WAS SOME SCIENCE BEHIND

01:33:34.241 --> 01:33:35.843
THAT AND DATA BEHIND THAT. I

01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:37.611
WOULD LOVE TO, TO GET TO

01:33:37.678 --> 01:33:39.347
UNDERSTAND THAT DATA BETTER. IF

01:33:39.413 --> 01:33:42.316
AND AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD, I

01:33:42.383 --> 01:33:43.150
UNDERSTAND THAT THE CURRENT

01:33:43.217 --> 01:33:45.519
LIMIT IS $1 MILLION, AND IT'S A

01:33:45.586 --> 01:33:48.689
VERY KIND OF EASY TO UNDERSTAND

01:33:48.756 --> 01:33:51.058
TALKING POINT, THAT THIS WOULD

01:33:51.125 --> 01:33:52.693
REDUCE THAT BY 90%, OR THE

01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:53.728
ORIGINAL PROPOSAL WOULD REDUCE

01:33:53.794 --> 01:33:56.163
THAT BY 95%. I THINK THAT'S AN

01:33:56.230 --> 01:33:57.131
EASY TALKING POINT TO

01:33:57.198 --> 01:33:57.765
UNDERSTAND. I DON'T FIND IT TO

01:33:57.832 --> 01:34:00.067
BE A CONVINCING ONE, BECAUSE I

01:34:00.134 --> 01:34:00.968
THINK THAT MILLION DOLLAR LIMIT

01:34:01.035 --> 01:34:03.170
WAS SET AT A TOTALLY DIFFERENT

01:34:03.237 --> 01:34:04.472
TIME. IT WAS SET AT A DIFFERENT

01:34:04.538 --> 01:34:05.740
TIME WHEN THE INDUSTRY WAS BRAND

01:34:05.806 --> 01:34:08.576
NEW, WHEN THERE WAS A LOT OF

01:34:08.642 --> 01:34:09.610
UNKNOWNS AS TO WHAT THE IMPACT

01:34:09.677 --> 01:34:11.479
OF THE INDUSTRY WOULD BE ON OUR

01:34:11.545 --> 01:34:13.481
ON OUR COMMUNITIES, ON DRIVERS,

01:34:13.547 --> 01:34:15.316
ON RIDERS, ON OTHER PASSENGERS,

01:34:15.383 --> 01:34:16.784
YOU KNOW, ON ON OTHER DRIVERS ON

01:34:16.851 --> 01:34:18.753
THE ROAD, ON THE INSURANCE

01:34:18.819 --> 01:34:20.121
MARKET. WE DON'T AND I THINK

01:34:20.187 --> 01:34:21.322
LARGELY THAT ORIGINAL MILLION

01:34:21.389 --> 01:34:22.590
DOLLAR LIMIT WAS, WAS SORT OF

01:34:22.656 --> 01:34:24.358
PLUCKED OUT OF THIN AIR AS

01:34:24.425 --> 01:34:26.394
SOMETHING TO BE SUPER

01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:28.796
CONSERVATIVE, TO GIVE

01:34:28.863 --> 01:34:30.331
CALIFORNIANS THE COMFORT TO, TO

01:34:30.398 --> 01:34:32.099
START USING THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY.

01:34:32.166 --> 01:34:34.101
BUT WE DON'T NEED TO PULL THINGS

01:34:34.168 --> 01:34:35.903
OUT OF THIN AIR ANYMORE BECAUSE

01:34:35.970 --> 01:34:37.104
WE'VE GOT OVER A DOZEN YEARS OF

01:34:37.171 --> 01:34:38.806
EXPERIENCE. WE'VE GOT A LOT OF

01:34:38.873 --> 01:34:39.974
DATA IN CALIFORNIA. WE'VE GOT A

01:34:40.041 --> 01:34:41.042
LOT OF DATA FROM OTHER STATES.

01:34:41.108 --> 01:34:43.044
AND, YOU KNOW, I'M STRUCK BY THE

01:34:43.110 --> 01:34:46.380
FACT THAT CALIFORNIA IS VERY OUT

01:34:46.447 --> 01:34:48.549
OF OUT OF WHACK WITH MOST OTHER

01:34:48.616 --> 01:34:50.551
STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I

01:34:50.618 --> 01:34:51.519
UNDERSTAND THOSE STATES MIGHT

01:34:51.585 --> 01:34:53.854
HAVE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT

01:34:53.921 --> 01:34:54.955
I'D LOVE TO UNDERSTAND, YOU

01:34:55.022 --> 01:34:57.291
KNOW, FOR THE STATES THAT HAVE

01:34:57.358 --> 01:34:58.626
MUCH LOWER LIMITS, WHAT IS THE

01:34:58.692 --> 01:35:00.594
IMPACT BEEN? WHAT IS THE IMPACT

01:35:00.661 --> 01:35:01.228
BEEN ON THE INSURANCE MARKET IN

01:35:01.295 --> 01:35:02.897
THOSE STATES? WHAT HAS THE

01:35:02.963 --> 01:35:03.898
IMPACT BEEN ON DRIVERS AND

01:35:03.964 --> 01:35:05.499
RIDERS AND, YOU KNOW, OTHER

01:35:05.566 --> 01:35:09.136
OTHER DRIVERS THAT AREN'T IN THE

01:35:09.203 --> 01:35:10.805
LYFT'S AND UBER'S IN THOSE

01:35:10.871 --> 01:35:12.273
STATES? WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE

01:35:12.339 --> 01:35:14.075
TO GUESS ANYMORE. WE'VE GOT DATA

01:35:14.141 --> 01:35:16.277
AND WE CAN LOOK AT THAT DATA TO

01:35:16.343 --> 01:35:18.179
FIGURE OUT WHAT REALLY IS THE

01:35:18.245 --> 01:35:20.281
RIGHT LIMIT. AND I DON'T KNOW IF

01:35:20.347 --> 01:35:23.150
IT'S 5100 OR IF IT'S 100 300, OR

01:35:23.217 --> 01:35:26.487
IF IT'S SOMETHING IN BETWEEN

01:35:26.554 --> 01:35:27.688
1100 AND 103 HUNDRED. YOU KNOW,

01:35:27.755 --> 01:35:30.124
I HOPE THAT THAT'S A CONTINUING

01:35:30.191 --> 01:35:31.292
CONVERSATION THAT THE

01:35:31.358 --> 01:35:33.227
LEGISLATURE HAS. I, YOU KNOW,

01:35:33.294 --> 01:35:34.495
AGAIN, REALLY WANT TO ENCOURAGE

01:35:34.562 --> 01:35:35.729
THE COMPANIES TO PROVIDE A LOT

01:35:35.796 --> 01:35:36.964
OF THAT INFORMATION, PROVIDE A

01:35:37.031 --> 01:35:38.866
LOT OF THAT DATA, BE AS

01:35:38.933 --> 01:35:40.067
TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE SO THAT

01:35:40.134 --> 01:35:41.869
WE ALL, AS LEGISLATORS, CAN GET

01:35:41.936 --> 01:35:43.003
A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT

01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:45.739
THAT RIGHT BALANCE IS. YOU KNOW,

01:35:45.806 --> 01:35:46.874
CLEARLY, WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE

01:35:46.941 --> 01:35:50.811
IS WAY TOO CONSERVATIVE, AND

01:35:50.878 --> 01:35:52.646
THERE'S A LOT OF POTENTIAL

01:35:52.713 --> 01:35:54.748
BENEFIT TO LOWERING THAT FOR

01:35:54.815 --> 01:35:56.183
CONSUMERS. YOU KNOW, FUNNY

01:35:56.250 --> 01:35:57.618
LITTLE ANECDOTE, BUT THE BERMAN

01:35:57.685 --> 01:35:59.553
FAMILY LOVES TO PICK EACH OTHER

01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:02.289
UP FROM THE AIRPORT. AND MY

01:36:02.356 --> 01:36:03.891
PARENTS LOVE IT. AND MY BROTHERS

01:36:03.958 --> 01:36:06.093
LOVE IT. AND I HATE IT BECAUSE I

01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:08.429
FIND IT TO BE A MASSIVE WASTE OF

01:36:08.496 --> 01:36:09.997
TIME. AND SO, YOU KNOW, A DECADE

01:36:10.064 --> 01:36:11.732
AGO, I'D BE LIKE, GET IN AN I

01:36:11.799 --> 01:36:14.168
WILL PAY FOR YOUR LYFT. I WILL

01:36:14.235 --> 01:36:14.969
PAY FOR YOUR UBER. LIKE THAT'S

01:36:15.035 --> 01:36:16.904
WAY, YOU KNOW, TIME BETTER SPENT

01:36:16.971 --> 01:36:18.205
THAN ME SPENDING AN HOUR DRIVING

01:36:18.272 --> 01:36:20.574
YOU AND PICKING YOU UP. BUT THE

01:36:20.641 --> 01:36:21.942
COST HAS GONE UP A LOT, AND

01:36:22.009 --> 01:36:23.611
THAT'S A HARDER ARGUMENT FOR ME

01:36:23.677 --> 01:36:24.845
TO MAKE. OR THAT'S A HARDER BILL

01:36:24.912 --> 01:36:26.914
FOR ME TO PAY WHEN MY BROTHER

01:36:26.981 --> 01:36:28.382
FLIES IN FROM PORTLAND. AND SO,

01:36:28.449 --> 01:36:29.817
YOU KNOW, IT HAS BEEN

01:36:29.884 --> 01:36:30.718
NOTICEABLE, I THINK, FOR

01:36:30.784 --> 01:36:33.154
EVERYBODY HOW MUCH, YOU KNOW,

01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:35.456
THE COST OF THESE RIDES HAS

01:36:35.523 --> 01:36:38.058
INCREASED. AND, YOU KNOW, SO I

01:36:38.125 --> 01:36:39.393
THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

01:36:39.460 --> 01:36:40.861
CONVERSATION TO LOWER THAT COST,

01:36:40.928 --> 01:36:43.564
LOWER IT FOR CONSUMERS, GET THAT

01:36:43.631 --> 01:36:45.132
MONEY TO WORKERS. I APPRECIATE

01:36:45.199 --> 01:36:46.600
THE COMMITMENT TO CONTINUING TO

01:36:46.667 --> 01:36:48.035
WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT, YOU

01:36:48.102 --> 01:36:51.238
KNOW, WE MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT

01:36:51.305 --> 01:36:53.073
THE, YOU KNOW, AS MUCH OF THE

01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:54.909
SAVINGS AS POSSIBLE ARE GOING TO

01:36:54.975 --> 01:36:55.809
GO TO WORKERS, THEY'RE GOING TO

01:36:55.876 --> 01:36:57.778
GO TO CONSUMERS AND LOOK FORWARD

01:36:57.845 --> 01:36:58.946
TO GETTING MORE OF THAT

01:36:59.013 --> 01:37:00.581
INFORMATION FROM Y'ALL OVER THE

01:37:00.648 --> 01:37:02.416
NEXT, YOU KNOW, SIX WEEKS OR SO

01:37:02.483 --> 01:37:03.951
AND, YOU KNOW, MAKING SURE THAT

01:37:04.018 --> 01:37:06.086
WE SET THAT PROPER LIMIT FOR

01:37:06.153 --> 01:37:07.488
CALIFORNIANS FOR THE NEXT DOZEN

01:37:07.555 --> 01:37:08.989
YEARS AND DON'T COME BACK, YOU

01:37:09.056 --> 01:37:10.324
KNOW, A DOZEN YEARS FROM NOW

01:37:10.391 --> 01:37:12.159
AND, AND SAY, OH, THAT WAS THAT

01:37:12.226 --> 01:37:14.228
WAS STILL TOO HIGH. SO I

01:37:14.295 --> 01:37:15.196
APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THE

01:37:15.262 --> 01:37:17.865
BILL. HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT. I

01:37:17.932 --> 01:37:19.233
KNOW THERE'S A LOT MORE

01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:19.900
CONVERSATION THAT STILL NEEDS TO

01:37:19.967 --> 01:37:20.668
HAPPEN AND LOOKING FORWARD TO

01:37:20.734 --> 01:37:21.735
HAVING THAT CONVERSATION. THANK

01:37:21.802 --> 01:37:24.738
YOU, MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU.

01:37:24.805 --> 01:37:26.073
ASSEMBLYWOMAN ORTEGA, YOU HAD

01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:27.241
ONE MORE COMMENT. YEAH, IT'S A

01:37:27.308 --> 01:37:29.310
QUESTION TO UBER LYFT. YOU

01:37:29.376 --> 01:37:33.447
MENTIONED $45 OUT OF $100 GOES

01:37:33.514 --> 01:37:36.183
TOWARDS INSURANCE. SO IF THIS

01:37:36.250 --> 01:37:39.119
BILL WERE TO PASS BECAUSE WE'RE

01:37:39.186 --> 01:37:41.021
TALKING A LOT ABOUT SAVINGS AND

01:37:41.088 --> 01:37:44.391
THE SAVINGS GOING TO WORKERS AND

01:37:44.458 --> 01:37:46.527
CONSUMERS. SO HOW MUCH SAVINGS

01:37:46.594 --> 01:37:48.762
ARE WE ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT?

01:37:48.829 --> 01:37:51.265
SO IF THE IF I'LL GO FIRST OKAY.

01:37:51.332 --> 01:37:52.933
OF THE GOVERNMENT MANDATED

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:53.901
INSURANCE REFERENCED IT ISN'T

01:37:53.968 --> 01:37:55.703
JUST THIS POLICY. SO THIS POLICY

01:37:55.769 --> 01:37:57.371
IS GETTING AT A PORTION OF THAT,

01:37:57.438 --> 01:37:59.673
TO BE SURE. AND THE WAYS THAT WE

01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:02.109
ARE LOOKING TO BE TRANSPARENT ON

01:38:02.176 --> 01:38:04.378
WHO IT BENEFITS. I'LL USE JUST

01:38:04.445 --> 01:38:06.447
SPEAKING FOR UBER IS IN OUR

01:38:06.513 --> 01:38:08.782
BOOKING FEE AND THE WAYS THAT IT

01:38:08.849 --> 01:38:10.484
BENEFITS DRIVERS. AS MENTIONED

01:38:10.551 --> 01:38:11.952
EARLIER TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER

01:38:12.019 --> 01:38:16.290
ALVAREZ, THE SAVINGS WILL BE,

01:38:16.357 --> 01:38:17.591
LET'S SAY, AROUND HALF OF THAT,

01:38:17.658 --> 01:38:18.993
MAYBE LESS. WE CAN GIVE YOU IN

01:38:19.059 --> 01:38:20.761
TERMS OF GOVERNMENT MANDATED

01:38:20.828 --> 01:38:22.129
INSURANCE, WHAT GOES TO

01:38:22.196 --> 01:38:24.031
LIABILITY AND WHAT GOES TO UIM.

01:38:24.098 --> 01:38:26.000
WE CAN GIVE YOU THE RANGE. WE'VE

01:38:26.066 --> 01:38:27.534
WE'VE IT'S ON OUR RECEIPTS NOW

01:38:27.601 --> 01:38:30.337
IN TERMS OF THE MEDIAN OF WHAT

01:38:30.404 --> 01:38:32.306
THOSE COSTS ARE IN CALIFORNIA ON

01:38:32.373 --> 01:38:33.974
RECEIPTS. BUT THE BOOKING FEE

01:38:34.041 --> 01:38:35.409
WILL BE THE PLACE THAT'S VERY

01:38:35.476 --> 01:38:37.444
TRANSPARENT AND WILL BE PART OF

01:38:37.511 --> 01:38:38.379
THE STUDY FOR, FOR THE MONEY

01:38:38.445 --> 01:38:39.613
BEING REINVESTED, THE WAYS THAT

01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:40.848
WE'RE SAYING. SO THE STUDY THAT

01:38:40.914 --> 01:38:43.083
YOU GUYS ARE ALL PROPOSING TO

01:38:43.150 --> 01:38:44.985
ADD, ALONG WITH THE AREAS THAT

01:38:45.052 --> 01:38:47.321
IT EXISTS TRANSPARENTLY IN OUR

01:38:47.388 --> 01:38:49.123
RECEIPTS. YEAH. AND FROM A LYFT

01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:52.192
STANDPOINT, WE CALCULATE

01:38:52.259 --> 01:38:53.360
GOVERNMENT MANDATE INSURANCE TO

01:38:53.427 --> 01:38:55.763
BE ABOUT $6 PER RIDE. AND AS

01:38:55.829 --> 01:38:59.033
RAMONA SAID, UIM IS A PORTION OF

01:38:59.099 --> 01:39:01.335
THAT PER RIDE FEE. AND SO WE

01:39:01.402 --> 01:39:03.103
WOULD BE SEEING SOME SAVINGS. I

01:39:03.170 --> 01:39:04.938
DON'T WANT TO VIOLATE ANY TYPE

01:39:05.005 --> 01:39:06.240
OF ANTITRUST LAWS, AND I DON'T

01:39:06.307 --> 01:39:07.641
WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT

01:39:07.708 --> 01:39:09.943
IMPACT WOULD BE, BUT WE WOULD

01:39:10.010 --> 01:39:11.245
GLADLY REACH OUT TO YOUR YOUR

01:39:11.312 --> 01:39:12.713
TEAM AND GIVE YOU THAT

01:39:12.780 --> 01:39:14.581
INFORMATION SEPARATELY. AND

01:39:14.648 --> 01:39:17.651
SORRY. GO AHEAD. NO, I'M ASKING

01:39:17.718 --> 01:39:20.220
HERE BECAUSE I'VE ASKED FOR THIS

01:39:20.287 --> 01:39:22.856
INFORMATION OVER THE WEEKEND AND

01:39:22.923 --> 01:39:25.259
I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE A NUMBER.

01:39:25.326 --> 01:39:27.461
OKAY, SO IF YOU'RE THE ARGUMENT

01:39:27.528 --> 01:39:30.798
HERE TODAY IS THAT THE UBER AND

01:39:30.864 --> 01:39:33.300
LYFT, IF WE PASS THIS BILL GET

01:39:33.367 --> 01:39:36.270
SIGNED, YOU WILL BE SAVING MONEY

01:39:36.337 --> 01:39:38.272
THAT WILL THEN BE PASSED TO THE

01:39:38.339 --> 01:39:40.240
CONSUMER AND TO THE WORKERS.

01:39:40.307 --> 01:39:41.875
CORRECT. SO I WANT TO KNOW WHAT

01:39:41.942 --> 01:39:43.377
THAT NUMBER IS. YEAH. AND I'LL

01:39:43.444 --> 01:39:45.846
JUST SAY WE HAVE NO INTEREST IN

01:39:45.913 --> 01:39:47.948
HAVING HIGHER, HIGHER FARES OR

01:39:48.015 --> 01:39:49.583
KEEPING FARES AS HIGH AS THEY

01:39:49.650 --> 01:39:51.085
ARE RIGHT NOW. IT'S NOT GOOD FOR

01:39:51.151 --> 01:39:53.287
BUSINESS. IT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE

01:39:53.354 --> 01:39:53.921
RIDERS, IT'S NOT GOOD FOR

01:39:53.987 --> 01:39:55.622
DRIVERS. SO ANY SAVINGS THAT WE

01:39:55.689 --> 01:39:58.025
COULD SEE FROM THESE INSURANCE

01:39:58.092 --> 01:40:00.327
SAVINGS WOULD GO BACK INTO THE

01:40:00.394 --> 01:40:01.328
MARKETPLACE. THAT'S JUST HOW

01:40:01.395 --> 01:40:02.996
IT'S GOING TO WORK. LOWER PRICES

01:40:03.063 --> 01:40:04.865
MEANS MORE RIDES. MORE RIDES

01:40:04.932 --> 01:40:06.367
MEANS MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO EARN

01:40:06.433 --> 01:40:07.768
AND MORE MONEY FOR DRIVERS. AND

01:40:07.835 --> 01:40:09.670
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE COMMITTED TO.

01:40:09.737 --> 01:40:12.673
AND SO I'M SORRY IF YOU HAVEN'T

01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:14.208
GOT THAT INFORMATION. AND I

01:40:14.274 --> 01:40:15.376
THOUGHT THAT WE HAD PROVIDED

01:40:15.442 --> 01:40:16.810
THAT, BUT WE WILL DEFINITELY

01:40:16.877 --> 01:40:17.845
PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION

01:40:17.911 --> 01:40:20.781
DIRECTLY. BUT BECAUSE WE ARE

01:40:20.848 --> 01:40:22.950
COMPETITORS, WE CANNOT SAY THAT

01:40:23.016 --> 01:40:24.752
PUBLICLY IN THE SAME ROOM

01:40:24.818 --> 01:40:27.988
TOGETHER. SO WE WOULD RATHER NOT

01:40:28.055 --> 01:40:31.592
VIOLATE ANTITRUST TODAY. OKAY.

01:40:31.658 --> 01:40:33.093
SEEING NO OTHER QUESTIONS OR

01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:34.395
COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE.

01:40:34.461 --> 01:40:36.263
SENATOR, WOULD YOU LIKE TO

01:40:36.330 --> 01:40:37.431
CLOSE? YEAH. THANK YOU SO MUCH,

01:40:37.498 --> 01:40:38.832
MADAM CHAIR. AND I REALLY

01:40:38.899 --> 01:40:41.001
APPRECIATE BOTH THE DIALOG AND

01:40:41.068 --> 01:40:42.436
THE ATTENTION HERE, BUT ALSO

01:40:42.503 --> 01:40:45.139
THE, THE UNIVERSAL INSISTENCE

01:40:45.205 --> 01:40:47.007
THAT THE FOCUS HERE IS ON

01:40:47.074 --> 01:40:49.777
AFFORDABILITY FOR, FOR RIDERS

01:40:49.843 --> 01:40:52.446
AND ALSO ON MAKING SURE THAT THE

01:40:52.513 --> 01:40:54.648
DRIVERS ARE APPROPRIATELY

01:40:54.715 --> 01:40:57.050
COMPENSATED. YOU MENTIONED THAT

01:40:57.117 --> 01:40:59.553
THAT IN AN UBER RIDE YOU ALWAYS

01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:02.556
ASK, ARE YOU IS THIS YOUR MAIN

01:41:02.623 --> 01:41:05.159
JOB AND ALL OF THAT? I DO THE

01:41:05.225 --> 01:41:06.927
SAME. AND THE DRIVER ALWAYS ASKS

01:41:06.994 --> 01:41:09.062
ME BACK, HOW MUCH WAS YOUR HOW

01:41:09.129 --> 01:41:10.798
MUCH DID YOU PAY FOR THIS RIDE?

01:41:10.864 --> 01:41:12.666
BECAUSE I'M NOT MAKING THAT MUCH

01:41:12.733 --> 01:41:14.201
BECAUSE IT'S ALL GOING TO THE

01:41:14.268 --> 01:41:16.203
FEES. AND SO THIS BILL IS

01:41:16.270 --> 01:41:17.304
INTENDED TO DO BOTH TO DO TO

01:41:17.371 --> 01:41:18.605
ACCOMPLISH BOTH THINGS. I DO

01:41:18.672 --> 01:41:21.175
WANT TO TURN TO A COUPLE OF THE

01:41:21.241 --> 01:41:24.611
OPPOSITION ELEMENTS AS WE CLOSE,

01:41:24.678 --> 01:41:26.079
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH

01:41:26.146 --> 01:41:27.047
THE OPPOSITION, AND THERE ARE

01:41:27.114 --> 01:41:28.782
SOME IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT HAVE

01:41:28.849 --> 01:41:29.716
BEEN RAISED. FIRST, JUST IN

01:41:29.783 --> 01:41:31.685
TERMS OF THE LOOK BACK FROM A

01:41:31.752 --> 01:41:33.086
DECADE AGO WHEN THIS WAS DONE, I

01:41:33.153 --> 01:41:34.888
JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR, BECAUSE

01:41:34.955 --> 01:41:36.590
THERE WERE SOME, SOME QUESTIONS

01:41:36.657 --> 01:41:37.858
ABOUT THE ABOUT WHAT I HAD SAID

01:41:37.925 --> 01:41:40.694
EARLIER AND TEN YEARS AGO WHEN

01:41:40.761 --> 01:41:42.262
THIS WHEN THIS WAS DONE, THERE

01:41:42.329 --> 01:41:44.298
WAS VERY SERIOUS WORK AND

01:41:44.364 --> 01:41:46.099
ANALYSIS DONE ON THE INSURANCE

01:41:46.166 --> 01:41:47.935
REQUIREMENTS FOR RIDESHARE IN

01:41:48.001 --> 01:41:49.870
THE BILL AND ALL OF THE

01:41:49.937 --> 01:41:51.839
HEARINGS. BUT AND HERE'S THE KEY

01:41:51.905 --> 01:41:53.841
DIFFERENCE, WHICH I THINK I JUST

01:41:53.907 --> 01:41:55.342
WANT TO EMPHASIZE FOR THE

01:41:55.409 --> 01:41:58.078
OPPOSITION, IS THAT IF YOU LOOK,

01:41:58.145 --> 01:42:01.181
I READ EVERY SENTENCE OF THE PUC

01:42:01.248 --> 01:42:03.116
HEARINGS ON THIS, THE

01:42:03.183 --> 01:42:04.485
RULEMAKING, ALL OF THE

01:42:04.551 --> 01:42:05.919
TRANSCRIPTS FROM EVERY SINGLE

01:42:05.986 --> 01:42:07.087
HEARING THAT THIS, THAT THAT

01:42:07.154 --> 01:42:09.890
BILL WENT THROUGH. UIM WAS

01:42:09.957 --> 01:42:11.525
VIRTUALLY NEVER MENTIONED. SO

01:42:11.592 --> 01:42:13.260
THERE WAS A VERY EXTENSIVE, AS

01:42:13.327 --> 01:42:14.394
THE OPPOSITION HAS TESTIFIED,

01:42:14.461 --> 01:42:16.330
VERY, VERY EXTENSIVE

01:42:16.396 --> 01:42:17.231
CONSIDERATION OF WHAT ARE THE

01:42:17.297 --> 01:42:19.032
RIGHT INSURANCE LIMITS FOR

01:42:19.099 --> 01:42:22.135
RIDESHARE GENERALLY. BUT ON YOU

01:42:22.202 --> 01:42:24.137
KNOW, IT WAS WE WERE ALREADY

01:42:24.204 --> 01:42:25.739
DOING IT. LET'S OKAY, LET'S MOVE

01:42:25.806 --> 01:42:28.242
ON TO THE NEXT ISSUE. SO THIS

01:42:28.308 --> 01:42:30.477
HAS NOT BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY

01:42:30.544 --> 01:42:32.679
STUDIED LITIGATED DESCRIBED. AND

01:42:32.746 --> 01:42:34.314
THAT'S WHY IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR

01:42:34.381 --> 01:42:36.550
THIS BILL TO BE DOING SO.

01:42:36.617 --> 01:42:38.452
SECOND, THE ISSUES THAT THE

01:42:38.519 --> 01:42:40.320
CONSUMER ATTORNEYS HAVE RAISED

01:42:40.387 --> 01:42:41.889
ARE REAL ONES. AS AS ASSEMBLY

01:42:41.955 --> 01:42:44.391
MEMBER GARABEDIAN REVEALED,

01:42:44.458 --> 01:42:46.260
THERE ARE LIKE 16,000 DIFFERENT

01:42:46.326 --> 01:42:47.761
WAYS IN WHICH THESE DIFFERENT

01:42:47.828 --> 01:42:50.230
POLICIES INTERACT OR SEGREGATE

01:42:50.297 --> 01:42:51.365
AND WHAT HAVE YOU. WE'VE BEEN

01:42:51.431 --> 01:42:53.066
TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH THOSE.

01:42:53.133 --> 01:42:53.901
WE'RE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING

01:42:53.967 --> 01:42:55.469
THOSE CONVERSATIONS. I WANT TO

01:42:55.536 --> 01:42:56.637
EMPHASIZE AT THE CONSUMER

01:42:56.703 --> 01:42:57.771
ATTORNEY'S SUGGESTION, WE DID

01:42:57.838 --> 01:43:00.340
ADD LANGUAGE THAT MAKES THIS THE

01:43:00.407 --> 01:43:02.109
RIDESHARE COMPANIES POLICY

01:43:02.175 --> 01:43:04.878
PRIMARY TO GET AT PART OF IT. I

01:43:04.945 --> 01:43:06.480
KNOW IT DOESN'T GET TO THIS

01:43:06.547 --> 01:43:07.748
ISSUE, BUT I'M SIMPLY SAYING WE

01:43:07.814 --> 01:43:09.283
HAVE BEEN VERY OPEN TO TRYING TO

01:43:09.349 --> 01:43:10.617
FIX THE INTERACTION OF THESE

01:43:10.684 --> 01:43:11.985
POLICIES, TO MAXIMIZE THE

01:43:12.052 --> 01:43:14.922
BENEFITS FOR, FOR, FOR CLAIMANTS

01:43:14.988 --> 01:43:16.957
AND FOR RIDERS AND DRIVERS AS

01:43:17.024 --> 01:43:18.625
WELL. WE'RE COMMITTED TO

01:43:18.692 --> 01:43:22.629
CONTINUE TO DO THAT. WE SEE THE

01:43:22.696 --> 01:43:24.665
CLAIMS IN THE UIM SPACE HERE, AS

01:43:24.731 --> 01:43:25.999
I THINK HAS BEEN WAS NOTED IN

01:43:26.066 --> 01:43:28.669
THE TESTIMONY AT ON AVERAGE,

01:43:28.735 --> 01:43:31.972
EIGHT OR 9 OR 10 TIMES HIGHER

01:43:32.039 --> 01:43:34.708
THAN CLAIMS IN THE NON UIM SPACE

01:43:34.775 --> 01:43:37.044
WHERE THERE IS REGULAR COVERAGE.

01:43:37.110 --> 01:43:38.345
AND IF WE'RE IN THE ACCIDENT, I

01:43:38.412 --> 01:43:40.581
GO, I'LL GO TO UC DAVIS MED

01:43:40.647 --> 01:43:41.715
CENTER, I WILL USE MY BLUE

01:43:41.782 --> 01:43:43.951
SHIELD COVERAGE, BUT IN MANY OF

01:43:44.017 --> 01:43:45.652
THE UIM CLAIMS AND YOU'LL SEE

01:43:45.719 --> 01:43:47.788
THIS IF YOU GO TO THE, YOU KNOW,

01:43:47.854 --> 01:43:49.356
THE ADS AND THE WEBSITES AND

01:43:49.423 --> 01:43:50.657
WHAT HAVE YOU, I WOULD BE

01:43:50.724 --> 01:43:51.892
DIVERTED INSTEAD TO A DIFFERENT

01:43:51.959 --> 01:43:53.427
MEDICAL PROVIDER CHARGING

01:43:53.493 --> 01:43:55.262
SUBSTANTIALLY MORE. AND SO THIS

01:43:55.329 --> 01:43:56.597
ISN'T A COST SHIFTING ISSUE. IT

01:43:56.663 --> 01:43:59.900
IS. IT IS A COST EXAGGERATION

01:43:59.967 --> 01:44:02.169
ISSUE IN A VERY TINY PART OF THE

01:44:02.235 --> 01:44:04.004
MARKET THAT WE'RE GRAPPLING WITH

01:44:04.071 --> 01:44:05.372
HERE. AND SO THE BILL IS

01:44:05.439 --> 01:44:07.608
INTENDED TO TRY TO TRY TO

01:44:07.674 --> 01:44:08.942
HARMONIZE THAT SO THAT IT

01:44:09.009 --> 01:44:09.776
MATCHES THE REST OF THE

01:44:09.843 --> 01:44:11.144
INSURANCE AND LIABILITY SYSTEM

01:44:11.211 --> 01:44:13.480
FOR, FOR, FOR THE REST. AND THEN

01:44:13.547 --> 01:44:15.148
LASTLY, I WOULD SAY THAT, YOU

01:44:15.215 --> 01:44:16.149
KNOW, OTHER ISSUES THAT HAVE

01:44:16.216 --> 01:44:18.151
BEEN RAISED AROUND ALGORITHMS

01:44:18.218 --> 01:44:19.853
AND SURGE PRICING AND ALL OF

01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:21.121
THAT, THAT THERE ARE REAL ISSUES

01:44:21.188 --> 01:44:23.190
AS BOTH ARE AS A WRITER AND WITH

01:44:23.256 --> 01:44:24.891
LOTS OF MY FRIENDS WHO ARE

01:44:24.958 --> 01:44:25.926
DRIVERS, I'M COMPLETELY THERE.

01:44:25.993 --> 01:44:28.729
THAT'S NOT THIS BILL. I'M HAPPY

01:44:28.795 --> 01:44:30.130
TO MAYBE CARRY SOMETHING NEXT

01:44:30.197 --> 01:44:31.264
YEAR, BUT THIS BILL IS REALLY

01:44:31.331 --> 01:44:32.766
ABOUT TRYING TO ASSURE THAT WE

01:44:32.833 --> 01:44:36.069
GET THE INSURANCE POLICIES TO

01:44:36.136 --> 01:44:37.638
BE, YOU KNOW, AMONG THE BEST IN

01:44:37.704 --> 01:44:39.239
THE COUNTRY, BUT ALSO RIGHT SIZE

01:44:39.306 --> 01:44:41.408
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO

01:44:41.475 --> 01:44:43.176
MAKE THIS ESSENTIAL BACKBONE

01:44:43.243 --> 01:44:44.511
PART OF OUR TRANSPORTATION

01:44:44.578 --> 01:44:46.813
SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA, AFFORDABLE

01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:48.649
RIDERS AND A VIABLE ECONOMIC

01:44:48.715 --> 01:44:50.050
ACTIVITY FOR DRIVERS. SO AGAIN,

01:44:50.117 --> 01:44:51.918
THANK YOU FOR THE TO THE

01:44:51.985 --> 01:44:52.686

01:47:02.315 --> 01:47:03.183
THROUGH A SETTLEMENT OR

01:47:03.250 --> 01:47:04.851
JUDGMENT. WHEN A PEACE OFFICER

01:47:04.918 --> 01:47:07.354
OR FIREFIGHTER IS INJURED ON

01:47:07.420 --> 01:47:09.322
DUTY DUE TO A THIRD PARTY'S

CLAIM. THIS CLAIM COVERS MEDICAL

01:47:15.996 --> 01:47:17.297
EXPENSES AND, UNDER LABOR CODE

01:47:17.364 --> 01:47:19.866

01:47:32.279 --> 01:47:34.181
HOWEVER, EXPEDITIOUSLY

01:47:34.247 --> 01:47:37.250

NO FURTHER INCOME SUPPORT IS

01:47:39.186 --> 01:47:42.522

PARTY'S LIABILITY INSURANCE

01:47:51.698 --> 01:47:53.400
LIMITS. WHEN BOTH AND THIS IS

01:47:53.466 --> 01:47:54.534
IMPORTANT, THE EMPLOYEE PROVES

01:47:54.601 --> 01:47:56.603
THEIR TOTAL DAMAGES EXCEED THE

01:47:56.670 --> 01:47:58.405
NET AMOUNT LEFT AFTER THE

01:47:58.471 --> 01:47:59.606
EMPLOYER'S CLAIM IS SATISFIED

01:47:59.673 --> 01:48:01.174
AND THE AVAILABILITY OR

01:48:01.241 --> 01:48:02.976
AVAILABLE LIABILITY INSURANCE

01:48:03.043 --> 01:48:04.311
LIMITS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO FULLY

01:48:04.377 --> 01:48:06.279
COVER BOTH THE EMPLOYER'S CLAIM

01:48:06.346 --> 01:48:08.014
AND THE EMPLOYER'S PROVEN

01:48:08.081 --> 01:48:10.383
DAMAGES. WITH THAT, I DO HAVE

01:48:10.450 --> 01:48:12.419

INTRODUCE THROUGH THE CHAIR, AND

I'LL HAVE THEM INTRODUCE. GOOD

01:48:17.490 --> 01:48:18.892
MORNING. THANK YOU. GOOD

01:48:18.959 --> 01:48:20.594
MORNING. MY NAME IS MEGAN

01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:21.928
BARTLETT. THANK YOU FOR HAVING

01:48:21.995 --> 01:48:23.163
US. I'M AN ATTORNEY WHO

01:48:23.230 --> 01:48:23.697
REPRESENTS PUBLIC SAFETY

01:48:23.763 --> 01:48:24.598
OFFICERS AND FIREFIGHTERS

01:48:24.664 --> 01:48:26.032
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. MY

01:48:26.099 --> 01:48:27.534
PRACTICE IS DEDICATED TO

01:48:27.601 --> 01:48:28.368
REPRESENTING FIREFIGHTERS AND

01:48:28.435 --> 01:48:29.636
PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS WHO HAVE

01:48:29.703 --> 01:48:30.971
BEEN INJURED IN THE LINE OF DUTY

01:48:31.037 --> 01:48:33.640
AT THE HANDS OF A THIRD PARTY. I

01:48:33.707 --> 01:48:35.075
PURSUE CIVIL CLAIMS AGAINST THE

01:48:35.141 --> 01:48:36.009
AT FAULT PARTIES ON BEHALF OF

01:48:36.076 --> 01:48:37.310
INJURED OFFICERS IN ORDER TO

01:48:37.377 --> 01:48:39.045
COMPENSATE THEM FOR THE DAMAGES

01:48:39.112 --> 01:48:39.846
THEY EXPERIENCE AS A RESULT OF

01:48:39.913 --> 01:48:41.581
THE INJURY. THE PROBLEM THIS

01:48:41.648 --> 01:48:43.049
BILL ADDRESSES IS THAT AN

01:48:43.116 --> 01:48:44.618
OFFICER INJURED ON DUTY BY A

01:48:44.684 --> 01:48:45.852
THIRD PARTY OFTEN RECEIVES

01:48:45.919 --> 01:48:47.254
LITTLE TO NO COMPENSATION FOR

01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:48.388
THEIR INJURIES, BECAUSE THE

01:48:48.455 --> 01:48:49.823
CURRENT LAW ALLOWS THE EMPLOYER

01:48:49.890 --> 01:48:51.691
TO BE REIMBURSED FIRST BEFORE

01:48:51.758 --> 01:48:53.827
THE OFFICER WORKER'S

01:48:53.894 --> 01:48:54.895
COMPENSATION WILL COVER SOME OF

01:48:54.961 --> 01:48:56.997
THEIR LOSSES. BUT THERE'S A LOT

01:48:57.063 --> 01:48:58.932
THAT IS NOT COVERED ANY LOSS OF

01:48:58.999 --> 01:49:00.667
OVERTIME, LOSS OF PROMOTION

01:49:00.734 --> 01:49:01.735
OPPORTUNITIES, PENSION BENEFITS,

01:49:01.801 --> 01:49:03.203
PAIN AND SUFFERING, TO NAME A

01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:04.604
FEW. THESE DAMAGES ARE NOT

01:49:04.671 --> 01:49:06.506
SPECULATIVE. THEY'RE REAL,

01:49:06.573 --> 01:49:08.074
CALCULABLE AND OFTEN

01:49:08.141 --> 01:49:09.409
UNRECOVERABLE WITH CURRENT LAW.

01:49:09.476 --> 01:49:10.944
IN SOME CASES, THE AT FAULT

01:49:11.011 --> 01:49:12.646
THIRD PARTY DOES NOT CARRY

01:49:12.712 --> 01:49:14.514
ENOUGH INSURANCE TO COVER THE

01:49:14.581 --> 01:49:15.582
EMPLOYER'S LOSSES, AS WELL AS

01:49:15.649 --> 01:49:17.717
THE OFFICER'S LOSSES. UNDER THE

01:49:17.784 --> 01:49:18.852
CURRENT SYSTEM, THE ENTIRE

01:49:18.919 --> 01:49:20.387
SETTLEMENT CAN BE CLAIMED BY THE

01:49:20.453 --> 01:49:21.721
EMPLOYER, LEAVING THE INJURED

01:49:21.788 --> 01:49:24.024
OFFICER WITH LITTLE TO NOTHING.

01:49:24.090 --> 01:49:25.058
THESE AMENDMENTS TO THE LABOR

01:49:25.125 --> 01:49:27.193
CODE REMEDY THOSE SITUATIONS BY

01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:28.528
GUARANTEEING THAT THE INJURED

01:49:28.595 --> 01:49:29.763
OFFICER RECEIVES A PORTION OF

01:49:29.829 --> 01:49:31.665
THE AVAILABLE RECOVERY, WHILE

01:49:31.731 --> 01:49:32.999
ENSURING THE EMPLOYER STILL HAS

01:49:33.066 --> 01:49:34.968
A RIGHT TO GET A PORTION OF THE

01:49:35.035 --> 01:49:36.803
RECOVERY. THIS SITUATION ONLY

01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:38.638
APPLIES WHERE LIMITS ARE

01:49:38.705 --> 01:49:40.140
INSUFFICIENT TO COVER THE

01:49:40.206 --> 01:49:41.908
DAMAGES THEY BOTH EXPERIENCE. ON

01:49:41.975 --> 01:49:43.610
THE WHOLE, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

01:49:43.677 --> 01:49:44.744
TOTAL NUMBER OF WORKER'S

01:49:44.811 --> 01:49:45.779
COMPENSATION CASES INVOLVING

01:49:45.845 --> 01:49:47.314
PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS, THOSE

01:49:47.380 --> 01:49:48.782
WITH THIRD PARTY FAULT ARE A

01:49:48.848 --> 01:49:50.183
VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF CASES.

01:49:50.250 --> 01:49:51.584
BUT WHEN THESE CASES DO OCCUR,

01:49:51.651 --> 01:49:53.053
IT CAN HAVE A SEVERE IMPACT ON

01:49:53.119 --> 01:49:55.221
THE LIVES OF THE INJURED

01:49:55.288 --> 01:49:56.289
OFFICERS. THE LANGUAGE IN THE

01:49:56.356 --> 01:49:57.958
AMENDED STATUTES IS NOT WITHOUT

01:49:58.024 --> 01:49:59.225
SIMILAR PRECEDENT AND IS MODELED

01:49:59.292 --> 01:50:01.261
AFTER CCP 3040, WHICH GOVERNS

01:50:01.328 --> 01:50:02.862
HEALTH INSURANCE REIMBURSEMENT

01:50:02.929 --> 01:50:03.897
RATES WHILE ENSURING THAT THE

01:50:03.964 --> 01:50:05.098
INJURED INDIVIDUAL RECEIVES A

01:50:05.165 --> 01:50:06.333
FAIR PORTION OF THE INSURANCE

01:50:06.399 --> 01:50:08.368
MONEY AVAILABLE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE

01:50:08.435 --> 01:50:10.670
IS GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION

01:50:10.737 --> 01:50:12.439
20252, WHICH GOVERNS CALPERS

01:50:12.505 --> 01:50:13.807
REIMBURSEMENT RIGHTS. IN SEVERE

01:50:13.873 --> 01:50:15.141
INJURY CASES WHERE THE OFFICER

01:50:15.208 --> 01:50:17.043
HAS TO MEDICALLY RETIRE, THAT

01:50:17.110 --> 01:50:18.511
STATUTE GUARANTEES A PORTION OF

01:50:18.578 --> 01:50:20.013
THE RECOVERY TO THE INJURED

01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:21.815
EMPLOYEE. OUR OUR INJURED

01:50:21.881 --> 01:50:22.716
OFFICERS DESERVE TO GET THEIR

01:50:22.782 --> 01:50:25.285
FAIR PORTION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR

01:50:25.352 --> 01:50:27.988
TIME AND SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING.

01:50:28.054 --> 01:50:29.656
KIANA LEWIS, DEPUTY SHERIFF IN

01:50:29.723 --> 01:50:31.992
CALIFORNIA ON JULY 19TH, 2022,

01:50:32.058 --> 01:50:33.727
WHILE WORKING UNIFORM PATROL, I

01:50:33.793 --> 01:50:35.128
WAS STRUCK, RUN OVER AND PINNED

01:50:35.195 --> 01:50:36.529
BENEATH A FULLY EQUIPPED PATROL

01:50:36.596 --> 01:50:38.164
VEHICLE CAUSED BY A DRUNK

01:50:38.231 --> 01:50:39.332
DRIVER. I REMAIN TRAPPED UNDER

01:50:39.399 --> 01:50:41.501
THE VEHICLE FOR APPROXIMATELY 25

01:50:41.568 --> 01:50:42.235
MINUTES BEFORE THE FIRE

01:50:42.302 --> 01:50:43.236
DEPARTMENT ARRIVED, AND USE

01:50:43.303 --> 01:50:44.738
SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT TO

01:50:44.804 --> 01:50:47.107
EXTRICATE ME. AS A RESULT OF

01:50:47.173 --> 01:50:47.941
THIS HORRIFIC INCIDENT, I

01:50:48.008 --> 01:50:48.842
SUSTAINED MULTIPLE FRACTURES AND

01:50:48.908 --> 01:50:50.276
LIGAMENT DAMAGE IN MY FOOT. BOTH

01:50:50.343 --> 01:50:53.513
OF MY KNEES REQUIRED SURGICAL

01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:54.848
INTERVENTION AND MY BACK NEEDED

01:50:54.914 --> 01:50:56.349
MULTIPLE PROCEDURES. SURVIVING

01:50:56.416 --> 01:50:58.184
SUCH AN IMPACT IS NOTHING SHORT

01:50:58.251 --> 01:50:59.652
OF A MIRACLE. HOWEVER, SURVIVAL

01:50:59.719 --> 01:51:01.788
HAS COME AT A STEEP COST.

01:51:01.855 --> 01:51:03.690
FOLLOWING THE COLLISION, MY LIFE

01:51:03.757 --> 01:51:04.691
CHANGED DRASTICALLY. I WENT FROM

01:51:04.758 --> 01:51:05.859
THRIVING IN EXTREME PHYSICAL

01:51:05.925 --> 01:51:07.027
ACTIVITIES TO NEEDING HELP WITH

01:51:07.093 --> 01:51:08.628
THE BASIC DAILY TASKS SUCH AS

01:51:08.695 --> 01:51:10.130
USING THE BATHROOM, SHOWERING,

01:51:10.196 --> 01:51:11.865
OR GETTING A GLASS OF WATER.

01:51:11.931 --> 01:51:16.536
THESE VISIBLE INJURIES TOLD ONLY

01:51:16.603 --> 01:51:17.804
A PART OF THE STORY. BEHIND THE

01:51:17.871 --> 01:51:18.872
SCENES, I ENDURED PROFOUND

01:51:18.938 --> 01:51:19.806
PERSONAL LOSSES. I WAS FORCED TO

01:51:19.873 --> 01:51:21.808
CANCEL ONCE IN A LIFETIME TRIPS

01:51:21.875 --> 01:51:22.976
AND PERSONAL EVENTS. I NEEDED

01:51:23.043 --> 01:51:24.577
HELP GETTING FOOD AND GROCERIES,

01:51:24.644 --> 01:51:25.245
RESORTING TO DELIVERY SERVICES,

01:51:25.311 --> 01:51:27.047
AND I RELIED ON OTHERS TO DRIVE

01:51:27.113 --> 01:51:28.715
ME TO AND FROM MEDICAL

01:51:28.782 --> 01:51:29.282
APPOINTMENTS FOR MONTHS. ALL

01:51:29.349 --> 01:51:31.117
THESE CHANGES WERE NOTICED BY MY

01:51:31.184 --> 01:51:31.751
COLLEAGUES. PROFESSIONALLY, THE

01:51:31.818 --> 01:51:33.119
IMPACT WAS ALSO SIGNIFICANT.

01:51:33.186 --> 01:51:35.388
BEING UNABLE TO WORK IN A FULL

01:51:35.455 --> 01:51:36.423
DUTY CAPACITY DIRECTLY IMPACTED

01:51:36.489 --> 01:51:38.191
MY ELIGIBILITY FOR SPECIALTY

01:51:38.258 --> 01:51:40.060
ASSIGNMENTS AND PROMOTIONAL

01:51:40.126 --> 01:51:41.461
OPPORTUNITIES. AFTER A YEAR OF

01:51:41.528 --> 01:51:42.796
SURGERIES AND REHABILITATION, I

01:51:42.862 --> 01:51:44.064
RETURNED TO LIGHT DUTY ONLY TO

01:51:44.130 --> 01:51:45.832
BE INFORMED THAT MY ABSENCE

01:51:45.899 --> 01:51:47.500
WOULD DELAY ANY ADVANCEMENT AND

01:51:47.567 --> 01:51:48.935
CONSIDERATION. ADDITIONALLY,

01:51:49.002 --> 01:51:50.103
BECAUSE I WAS RESTRICTED FROM

01:51:50.170 --> 01:51:51.438
WORKING OVERTIME, I EXPERIENCED

01:51:51.504 --> 01:51:52.939
A FINANCIAL LOSS ESTIMATED AT

01:51:53.006 --> 01:51:55.809
AROUND $50,000 IN JUST ONE YEAR.

01:51:55.875 --> 01:51:56.876
DESPITE MY RECOVERY AND

01:51:56.943 --> 01:51:59.179
RETURNING TO DUTY, I CARRY AN

01:51:59.245 --> 01:52:00.947
UNSPOKEN STIGMA BECAUSE OF MY

01:52:01.014 --> 01:52:02.715
INCIDENT. WHILE I'VE WORKED HARD

01:52:02.782 --> 01:52:04.451
TO REGAIN MY PHYSICAL AND

01:52:04.517 --> 01:52:05.218
PROFESSIONAL FOOTING, THERE'S A

01:52:05.285 --> 01:52:05.985
LINGERING PERCEPTION THAT I'M

01:52:06.052 --> 01:52:08.221
LESS CAPABLE DUE TO THE SEVERITY

01:52:08.288 --> 01:52:09.089
OF MY INJURIES AND THE TIME

01:52:09.155 --> 01:52:11.724
SPENT AWAY FROM FULL DUTY. THIS

01:52:11.791 --> 01:52:12.392
PERCEPTION, WHETHER CONSCIOUS OR

01:52:12.459 --> 01:52:13.827
NOT, PLACES ME AT A DISADVANTAGE

01:52:13.893 --> 01:52:15.395
WHEN IT COMES TO FAIR

CALIFORNIA COALITION ON WORKERS

01:53:32.372 --> 01:53:32.939

01:53:33.006 --> 01:53:35.275
TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND THE

01:53:35.341 --> 01:53:36.709
SPONSORS AND THE COMMITTEE FOR

01:53:36.776 --> 01:53:38.144
SOME ROBUST CONVERSATION OVER

01:53:38.211 --> 01:53:40.547
THE PAST FEW MONTHS, FEW WEEKS.

01:53:40.613 --> 01:53:41.681
UNFORTUNATELY, THOSE

01:53:41.748 --> 01:53:42.882
CONVERSATIONS WEREN'T FRUITFUL

01:53:42.949 --> 01:53:44.217
AND PRODUCING A WORKABLE MIDDLE

01:53:44.284 --> 01:53:45.552
GROUND FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE, AND

01:53:45.618 --> 01:53:46.653
WE'RE OPPOSED FOR THAT REASON

01:53:46.719 --> 01:53:48.855
TODAY. FIRST, BRIEFLY, ON OUR

01:53:48.922 --> 01:53:50.590
CONCERNS WITH THE UNDERLYING

01:53:50.657 --> 01:53:52.458
ISSUE HERE, WHEN AN EMPLOYEE IS

01:53:52.525 --> 01:53:54.994
INJURED AT WORK, THEIR EMPLOYER

01:53:55.061 --> 01:53:56.262
STEPS IN IMMEDIATELY TO PROVIDE

01:53:56.329 --> 01:53:57.497
MEDICAL TREATMENT AND CASH

01:53:57.564 --> 01:53:59.332
BENEFITS TO OFFSET LOST WAGES.

01:53:59.399 --> 01:54:01.167
CALIFORNIA HAS A NO FAULT

01:54:01.234 --> 01:54:01.935
SYSTEM, SO EMPLOYERS STEP IN TO

01:54:02.001 --> 01:54:03.002
PROVIDE THESE BENEFITS EVEN WHEN

01:54:03.069 --> 01:54:05.171
A THIRD PARTY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:54:05.238 --> 01:54:06.206
THE WORKPLACE ACCIDENT. STATE

01:54:06.272 --> 01:54:08.007
LAW RECOGNIZES THAT IN THOSE

01:54:08.074 --> 01:54:09.876
CASES, THE EMPLOYER HAS A

01:54:09.943 --> 01:54:10.577
FINANCIAL LOSS RESULTING FROM

01:54:10.643 --> 01:54:12.412
THOSE ACCIDENTS, AND WE'RE

01:54:12.478 --> 01:54:13.012
ALLOWED TO RECOVER OUR COSTS

01:54:13.079 --> 01:54:14.948
FROM THE RESPONSIBLE THIRD PARTY

01:54:15.014 --> 01:54:16.616
EMPLOYER. RECOVERIES

01:54:16.683 --> 01:54:17.750
SPECIFICALLY FOR PUBLIC SAFETY

01:54:17.817 --> 01:54:19.552
OFFICERS CAN BE EXPENSIVE, IN

01:54:19.619 --> 01:54:20.653
LARGE PART BECAUSE THE

01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:21.955
LEGISLATURE HAS GRANTED THEM

01:54:22.021 --> 01:54:22.622
SPECIAL BENEFITS THAT HELP

01:54:22.689 --> 01:54:24.057
SOFTEN THE FINANCIAL IMPACT ON

01:54:24.123 --> 01:54:26.526
WORKPLACE INJURIES. THE SENATOR

01:54:26.593 --> 01:54:29.562
TOUCHED ON 4850 BENEFITS, WHICH

01:54:29.629 --> 01:54:31.598
PROVIDE A FULL YEAR OF FULL

01:54:31.664 --> 01:54:33.866
SALARY TAX FREE TO THE INJURED

01:54:33.933 --> 01:54:35.168
WORKERS. SO IN THOSE SCENARIOS,

01:54:35.235 --> 01:54:35.969
THEY'RE ACTUALLY RECEIVING MORE

01:54:36.035 --> 01:54:37.904
TAKE HOME PAY THAN THEY DO WHEN

01:54:37.971 --> 01:54:39.639
THEY'RE WORKING. AND THEN IF A

01:54:39.706 --> 01:54:40.807
PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICER CAN'T

01:54:40.873 --> 01:54:41.874
RETURN TO THEIR NORMAL JOB, THEY

01:54:41.941 --> 01:54:43.977
ARE ELIGIBLE FOR INDUSTRIAL

01:54:44.043 --> 01:54:45.078
DISABILITY RETIREMENT BENEFITS

01:54:45.144 --> 01:54:46.746
IN ADDITION TO NORMAL PERMANENT

01:54:46.813 --> 01:54:48.414
DISABILITY BENEFITS, THEY CAN

01:54:48.481 --> 01:54:49.249
WORK WHILE RECEIVING THOSE

01:54:49.315 --> 01:54:50.416
BENEFITS, THEIR LIFETIME

01:54:50.483 --> 01:54:51.818
BENEFITS. AND THEY'RE PRETTY

01:54:51.884 --> 01:54:53.686
SUBSTANTIAL. SO STATE AND LOCAL

01:54:53.753 --> 01:54:55.788
EMPLOYERS FACE SIGNIFICANT COSTS

01:54:55.855 --> 01:54:57.257
AND EFFECTIVE RECOVERY FROM

01:54:57.323 --> 01:54:58.725
THOSE RESPONSIBLE THIRD PARTIES

01:54:58.791 --> 01:55:00.860
IS REALLY CRITICAL BECAUSE THE

01:55:00.927 --> 01:55:02.095
PUBLIC NEEDS THOSE RESOURCES

01:55:02.161 --> 01:55:03.630
BACK TO PROVIDE CRITICAL

01:55:03.696 --> 01:55:06.899
SERVICES TO CONSTITUENTS.

01:55:06.966 --> 01:55:08.401
DESPITE OUR CONCERNS WITH THE

01:55:08.468 --> 01:55:11.037
UNDERLYING BILL, I THINK WE

01:55:11.104 --> 01:55:12.739
TRIED OUR BEST TO WORK WITH THE

01:55:12.805 --> 01:55:13.806
AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS ON A

01:55:13.873 --> 01:55:16.042
MIDDLE GROUND. WE PROPOSED

01:55:16.109 --> 01:55:17.377
AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD HAVE

01:55:17.443 --> 01:55:18.678
ESSENTIALLY TAKEN THE POLICY

01:55:18.745 --> 01:55:21.414
THAT'S IN SB 487, AND APPLIED IT

01:55:21.481 --> 01:55:22.282
ONLY IN SITUATIONS WHERE YOU HAD

01:55:22.348 --> 01:55:24.584
VERY LIMITED INSURANCE. IF THE

01:55:24.651 --> 01:55:26.152
PROBLEM IS THAT THERE'S NOT

01:55:26.219 --> 01:55:27.920
ENOUGH MONEY TO GO AROUND, I

01:55:27.987 --> 01:55:30.023
THINK WE CAN GET TO THE PLACE

01:55:30.089 --> 01:55:31.424
WHERE WE CAN SUPPORT THAT IN A

01:55:31.491 --> 01:55:32.892
IN A SITUATION WHERE THERE'S

01:55:32.959 --> 01:55:33.960
LIMITED INSURANCE. YOU KNOW,

01:55:34.027 --> 01:55:35.028
COMMERCIAL VEHICLES, THOUGH,

01:55:35.094 --> 01:55:36.462
CARRY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF

01:55:36.529 --> 01:55:37.597
INSURANCE. AND WE FEEL LIKE WHEN

01:55:37.664 --> 01:55:38.765
THERE'S THAT MUCH MONEY

01:55:38.831 --> 01:55:40.133
AVAILABLE, THE PUBLIC SHOULD BE

01:55:40.199 --> 01:55:42.068
REIMBURSED FOR THEIR COSTS. THE

01:55:42.135 --> 01:55:43.102
OTHER THING THAT WE PROPOSED WAS

01:55:43.169 --> 01:55:45.104
A SUNSET AND A STUDY, A STUDY

01:55:45.171 --> 01:55:45.838
WITH THE COMMISSION ON HEALTH

01:55:45.905 --> 01:55:48.074
AND SAFETY AND WORKERS

01:55:48.141 --> 01:55:48.708
COMPENSATION. BECAUSE THE BILL

01:55:48.775 --> 01:55:50.643
IS LARGELY PROCEEDING ON

01:55:50.710 --> 01:55:52.178
ANECDOTE AT THIS POINT, WE THINK

01:55:52.245 --> 01:55:53.813
THAT A FULLER EXAMINATION OF THE

01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:54.947
DATA, THE OUTCOMES IN THESE

01:55:55.014 --> 01:55:56.616
THIRD PARTY CASES WOULD BE

01:55:56.683 --> 01:55:57.850
WARRANTED FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:55:57.917 --> 01:55:59.686
MAKE PERMANENT CHANGES TO THE

01:55:59.752 --> 01:56:01.254
WAY THIS MONEY FLOWS IN THIRD

01:56:01.321 --> 01:56:02.121
PARTY RECOVERIES. AND FOR THOSE

01:56:02.188 --> 01:56:04.691
REASONS, WE URGE YOUR NO VOTE

01:56:04.757 --> 01:56:05.825
TODAY, BUT WOULD BE OPEN TO

01:56:05.892 --> 01:56:07.360
FURTHER CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

01:56:07.427 --> 01:56:08.628
SENATOR. GOOD MORNING, MADAM

EMPLOYEES, IS RESPECTFULLY

01:56:22.342 --> 01:56:24.110
OPPOSED TO SB 487, WHICH WOULD

01:56:24.177 --> 01:56:26.179
LIMIT THE ABILITY OF PUBLIC

01:56:26.245 --> 01:56:27.547
AGENCY EMPLOYERS TO RECOVER THE

01:56:27.613 --> 01:56:29.048
COST OF WORKER'S COMPENSATION

01:56:29.115 --> 01:56:30.183
BENEFITS. WHEN A POLICE OFFICER

01:56:30.249 --> 01:56:32.018
OR FIREFIGHTER IS INJURED DUE TO

01:56:32.085 --> 01:56:33.786
THE FAULT OF A THIRD PARTY,

01:56:33.853 --> 01:56:35.154
FIRST RESPONDERS RECEIVE

01:56:35.221 --> 01:56:36.289

01:56:43.896 --> 01:56:45.531
GENEROUS TAX FREE INDUSTRIAL

01:56:45.598 --> 01:56:47.400
DISABILITY RETIREMENT. ALL OF

01:56:47.467 --> 01:56:50.203
THESE, ALL OF WHICH FOR FAR

01:56:50.269 --> 01:56:51.771
EXCEED WHAT'S AVAILABLE TO OTHER

INJURED WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA.

01:56:53.473 --> 01:56:54.741
AND THESE ARE IMPORTANT

01:56:54.807 --> 01:56:55.842
BENEFITS, BUT THEY COME AT A

01:56:55.908 --> 01:56:59.345
HIGH COST. IT IS NOT A MINOR

01:56:59.412 --> 01:57:00.780
FISCAL CHANGE TO LIMIT THE

01:57:00.847 --> 01:57:02.115
RECOUPING OF THESE TAXPAYER

01:57:02.181 --> 01:57:03.716

OWN INTERNAL REVIEW OF LOCAL

01:57:10.223 --> 01:57:11.657
GOVERNMENT DATA, THIS IS A

01:57:11.724 --> 01:57:12.825
MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR CONSTRAINT

01:57:12.892 --> 01:57:14.460
ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT DOLLARS.

01:57:14.527 --> 01:57:16.262
WHEN ANOTHER PARTY CAUSES THE

01:57:16.329 --> 01:57:17.730
INJURY, THE ONLY AVENUE FOR

01:57:17.797 --> 01:57:19.866

01:57:21.401 --> 01:57:23.836

01:57:23.903 --> 01:57:25.471

01:57:25.538 --> 01:57:27.440
ABILITY WITHOUT ANY DATA

01:57:27.507 --> 01:57:29.208
DEMONSTRATING THE PROBLEM. THIS

AGENCY LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTS

01:57:38.451 --> 01:57:41.020
THAT IT DID NOT CAUSE WITHOUT A

01:58:20.626 --> 01:58:22.562
ASSEMBLYMAN RODRIGUEZ, I JUST

01:58:22.628 --> 01:58:23.930
WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND ASK

01:58:23.996 --> 01:58:25.531
TO BE ADDED AS A COAUTHOR,

01:58:25.598 --> 01:58:28.901
PLEASE. THANK YOU. OKAY. GIBSON.

01:58:28.968 --> 01:58:30.403
SURE. FOR THE OPPOSITION, WHAT

01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:33.873
DOES ONE DO IF A IF AN OFFICER

01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:37.143
IS INJURED BY A THIRD PERSON AND

01:58:37.210 --> 01:58:40.413
IS UNABLE TO WORK, WHAT DOES A

01:58:40.480 --> 01:58:44.417
PERSON DO? WELL, WORKER'S

01:58:44.484 --> 01:58:45.051
COMPENSATION BENEFITS WOULD NEED

01:58:45.117 --> 01:58:47.453
TO BE PROVIDED IMMEDIATELY.

01:58:47.520 --> 01:58:48.354
STATUTORILY, WE'RE REQUIRED TO

01:58:48.421 --> 01:58:49.722
PROVIDE THOSE BENEFITS NO MATTER

01:58:49.789 --> 01:58:51.524
WHAT THE SITUATION. IF IT

01:58:51.591 --> 01:58:53.359
OCCURRED IN THE COURSE AND SCOPE

01:58:53.426 --> 01:58:55.261
OF WORK, WE'RE GOING TO PAY. AND

01:58:55.328 --> 01:58:57.029
THAT'S WHY WE TRY TO SEEK A

01:58:57.096 --> 01:58:58.731
RECOVERY ON THE BACK END. SO IN

01:58:58.798 --> 01:59:00.199
THIS CASE, WE WOULD PAY 4850

01:59:00.266 --> 01:59:02.034
BENEFITS, FULL SALARY FOR A FULL

01:59:02.101 --> 01:59:02.969
YEAR, AND THEN WE WOULD SWITCH

01:59:03.035 --> 01:59:04.537
TO TEMPORARY DISABILITY,

01:59:04.604 --> 01:59:05.938
TEMPORARY DISABILITY BENEFITS,

01:59:06.005 --> 01:59:07.740
WHICH IS TWO THIRDS OF THE

01:59:07.807 --> 01:59:08.908
AVERAGE WEEKLY WAGE FOR ANOTHER

01:59:08.975 --> 01:59:11.644
YEAR. AND THEN AFTER THAT,

01:59:11.711 --> 01:59:13.045
PERMANENT DISABILITY, INDUSTRIAL

01:59:13.112 --> 01:59:13.779
DISABILITY, RETIREMENT, THOSE

01:59:13.846 --> 01:59:16.282
THINGS WOULD COME INTO PLAY. SO

01:59:16.349 --> 01:59:18.885
PERSONS, PERSONS NOT ABLE TO

01:59:18.951 --> 01:59:20.753
WORK AND AT ALL THAT RUNS OUT

01:59:20.820 --> 01:59:22.855
AND NOT ABLE TO RESUME HIS OR

01:59:22.922 --> 01:59:26.592
HER FULL, FULL DUTY. CORRECT.

01:59:26.659 --> 01:59:28.327
THEY WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR

01:59:28.394 --> 01:59:29.362
INDUSTRIAL DISABILITY

01:59:29.428 --> 01:59:31.464
RETIREMENT, WHICH STARTS AT 50%

01:59:31.531 --> 01:59:33.666
OF YOUR LAST WAGE AND THEN GOES

01:59:33.733 --> 01:59:35.935
UP. I THINK IT'S 2% FOR EVERY

01:59:36.002 --> 01:59:37.570
YEAR OF SERVICE, DEPENDING ON

01:59:37.637 --> 01:59:39.105
DEPENDING IF YOU HAVE A LONG

01:59:39.171 --> 01:59:40.540
ENOUGH TENURE OF SERVICE.

01:59:40.606 --> 01:59:43.476
SENATOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

01:59:43.543 --> 01:59:44.877
THAT QUESTION. HAVING SERVED AS

01:59:44.944 --> 01:59:46.279
CRITICAL RESPONSE CHAPLAIN FOR A

01:59:46.345 --> 01:59:49.582
POLICE AGENCY SINCE 2007, I HAVE

01:59:49.649 --> 01:59:50.883
WITNESSED, AND I TAKE OFFENSE,

01:59:50.950 --> 01:59:53.486
THAT THIS IS JUST AN ANECDOTAL

01:59:53.553 --> 01:59:56.055
BILL. I HAVE WITNESSED AND SPOKE

01:59:56.122 --> 01:59:58.157
WITH MANY OFFICERS WHO HAVE BEEN

01:59:58.224 --> 02:00:00.059
INJURED, WHETHER BY THIRD PARTY

02:00:00.126 --> 02:00:03.930
OR NOT, AND THE WORKER'S COMP

02:00:03.996 --> 02:00:07.667
CLAIM MAY TAKE YEARS TO GET

02:00:07.733 --> 02:00:09.802
REIMBURSED. AS A MATTER OF FACT,

02:00:09.869 --> 02:00:11.003
THEY GO THROUGH ALL THEIR SICK

02:00:11.070 --> 02:00:12.638
TIME, THEY GO THROUGH ALL THEIR

02:00:12.705 --> 02:00:13.372
VACATION TIME. MOST LIKELY THEY

02:00:13.439 --> 02:00:15.341
HAVE TO SUE THE AGENCY THAT

02:00:15.408 --> 02:00:18.010
THEY'RE WORKING FOR THE

02:00:18.077 --> 02:00:19.111
MUNICIPALITY TO BE ABLE TO EVEN

02:00:19.178 --> 02:00:21.247
BREAK INTO BEGINNING THE

02:00:21.314 --> 02:00:22.782
BENEFITS. AND SOME OF US THAT

02:00:22.848 --> 02:00:24.951
ARE EXPOSED TO EMERGENCY

02:00:25.017 --> 02:00:26.686
SERVICES KNOW GOOD AND WELL THAT

02:00:26.752 --> 02:00:28.487
I'M TELLING THE TRUTH. SO WITH

02:00:28.554 --> 02:00:31.958
THAT, THIS IS ABOUT AN INJURED

02:00:32.024 --> 02:00:34.493
PARTY BY A THIRD PARTY THAT HAS

02:00:34.560 --> 02:00:36.095
TO LITERALLY GO GET THEIR OWN

02:00:36.162 --> 02:00:38.731
ATTORNEY, FILE THEIR OWN CIVIL

02:00:38.798 --> 02:00:40.366
LAWSUIT, AND WHEN THEY GET THAT

02:00:40.433 --> 02:00:41.767
PAYOUT, THE COUNTY WANTS TO COME

02:00:41.834 --> 02:00:43.336
IN OR THE MUNICIPALITY WANTS TO

02:00:43.402 --> 02:00:45.137
COME IN AND TAKE THAT AWAY FROM

02:00:45.204 --> 02:00:48.207
THEM AND ALLOW THEM NO RECOVERY,

02:00:48.274 --> 02:00:49.642
FOR WHETHER IT BE A FUTURE

02:00:49.709 --> 02:00:50.810
PROMOTION THAT THEY WOULD HAVE

02:00:50.876 --> 02:00:52.178
QUALIFIED FOR OR, AS YOU HEARD,

02:00:52.244 --> 02:00:53.913
THE WITNESS OF THE TESTIMONY. SO

02:00:53.980 --> 02:00:57.183
WITH THAT, BASICALLY THE INJURED

02:00:57.249 --> 02:00:58.784
OFFICER OR THE INJURED

02:00:58.851 --> 02:01:00.953
FIREFIGHTER GOES WITHOUT, AND IF

02:01:01.020 --> 02:01:03.789
THEY'RE BLESSED ENOUGH, THEY'RE

02:01:03.856 --> 02:01:06.525
THEIR COLLEAGUES THAT ARE

02:01:06.592 --> 02:01:08.828
SERVING WITH THEM WILL DONATE

02:01:08.894 --> 02:01:11.030
SICK TIME TO HELP THEM GET

02:01:11.097 --> 02:01:13.399
THROUGH. BUT MANY OF THEM SUFFER

02:01:13.466 --> 02:01:14.834
AND EVEN SOME LOSE THEIR HOMES

02:01:14.900 --> 02:01:16.769
OVER IT. AND THE REASON WHY I

02:01:16.836 --> 02:01:19.038
ASK THAT QUESTION, I'M REMINDED

02:01:19.105 --> 02:01:19.805
OF BEING ON THIS COMMITTEE A

02:01:19.872 --> 02:01:21.073
LONG TIME WHEN THERE WAS A

02:01:21.140 --> 02:01:24.243
PREVIOUS INSURANCE CHAIR AND

02:01:24.310 --> 02:01:26.746
WHEN OFFICERS WERE OFF DUTY, AND

02:01:26.812 --> 02:01:28.981
THERE WAS A MASS SHOOTING IN LAS

02:01:29.048 --> 02:01:31.083
VEGAS, NEVADA, AND THERE WAS A

02:01:31.150 --> 02:01:33.619
LOT OF CALIFORNIA OFFICERS WHO

02:01:33.686 --> 02:01:35.121
SPRUNG INTO ACTION, AND THERE

02:01:35.187 --> 02:01:37.156
WAS A LOT OF DEATHS THAT

02:01:37.223 --> 02:01:39.025
OCCURRED. AND THERE WAS THIS

02:01:39.091 --> 02:01:40.960
MISNOMER THAT THAT WAS TOWED TO

02:01:41.027 --> 02:01:42.528
A LOT OF OFFICERS, INCLUDING

02:01:42.595 --> 02:01:44.397
MYSELF, THAT YOU'RE AN OFFICER

02:01:44.463 --> 02:01:45.931
24 HOURS A DAY, SEVEN DAYS A

02:01:45.998 --> 02:01:48.734
WEEK. AND THAT MISNOMER TOOK WAS

02:01:48.801 --> 02:01:50.536
IN EVERYONE'S MIND. AND THOSE

02:01:50.603 --> 02:01:51.971
OFFICERS WHO WERE FROM

02:01:52.038 --> 02:01:53.439
CALIFORNIA SPRUNG TO ACTION,

02:01:53.506 --> 02:01:55.975
SAVED A LOT OF LIVES. THEY WERE

02:01:56.042 --> 02:01:59.178
INJURED WITHIN, WITHIN

02:01:59.245 --> 02:02:01.113
THEMSELVES, CAME TO CALIFORNIA,

02:02:01.180 --> 02:02:04.216
FILED CLAIMS, A LOT OF INJURIES.

02:02:04.283 --> 02:02:05.751
CALIFORNIA SAID THAT THEY WERE

02:02:05.818 --> 02:02:07.219
NOT IN CALIFORNIA, SO THEY WERE

02:02:07.286 --> 02:02:09.355
NOT ON DUTY, EVEN THOUGH THEY

02:02:09.422 --> 02:02:10.189
WERE SUPPOSED TO BE POLICE

02:02:10.256 --> 02:02:12.191
OFFICERS 24 HOURS A DAY, SEVEN

02:02:12.258 --> 02:02:14.393
DAYS A WEEK. NO MATTER YOU'RE IN

02:02:14.460 --> 02:02:16.162
CALIFORNIA OR NOT. AND THEY WERE

02:02:16.228 --> 02:02:17.897
DENIED CLAIMS. A LOT OF THEM

02:02:17.963 --> 02:02:19.665
WERE NOT ABLE TO RETURN BACK TO

02:02:19.732 --> 02:02:21.834
DUTY, AND POLICY WAS BROUGHT

02:02:21.901 --> 02:02:24.003
BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE, AND WE

02:02:24.070 --> 02:02:28.007
SAW THE NEED TO, YOU KNOW, TO

02:02:28.074 --> 02:02:31.577
COVER THEM, AND RIGHTFULLY SO. I

02:02:31.644 --> 02:02:33.779
THINK THIS IS A GOOD POLICY

02:02:33.846 --> 02:02:36.248
BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT, AS YOU

02:02:36.315 --> 02:02:38.417
DESCRIBE, WE CANNOT AFFORD THOSE

02:02:38.484 --> 02:02:41.287
PARTICULAR OFFICERS, THOSE FIRST

02:02:41.353 --> 02:02:43.489
RESPONDERS, TO BE NOT BE COVERED

02:02:43.556 --> 02:02:45.324
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT

02:02:45.391 --> 02:02:46.292
THING TO DO, EVEN THOUGH IT'S

02:02:46.358 --> 02:02:50.496
THE THIRD PARTY. AND THOSE

02:02:50.563 --> 02:02:52.164
INDIVIDUALS ARE IN FACT, AT

02:02:52.231 --> 02:02:54.333
WORK. AND I THINK THEY SHOULD BE

02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:57.403
COVERED. AND I DO SEE THE NEED,

02:02:57.470 --> 02:02:59.705
EVEN AS THIS DEPUTY HAS

02:02:59.772 --> 02:03:01.674
INDICATED, ALL THE THINGS YOU

02:03:01.741 --> 02:03:03.609
WENT THROUGH AND STILL GOING

02:03:03.676 --> 02:03:05.745
THROUGH LOSING COMPENSATION,

02:03:05.811 --> 02:03:09.749
LOSING 50,000, AND THEN ALSO THE

02:03:09.815 --> 02:03:11.817
INABILITY TO PROMOTE, YOU ARE

02:03:11.884 --> 02:03:15.788
STILL WORKING AND YOU KNOW, ALL

02:03:15.855 --> 02:03:17.256
THOSE THINGS YOU HAVE TO DEAL

02:03:17.323 --> 02:03:19.925
WITH FINANCIALLY MOVING FORWARD.

02:03:19.992 --> 02:03:21.827
I THINK THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT

02:03:21.894 --> 02:03:23.796
THE POLICIES AND BE ABLE TO

02:03:23.863 --> 02:03:25.131
SUPPORT THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO

02:03:25.197 --> 02:03:27.399
SERVE US. AND I UNDERSTAND THE

02:03:27.466 --> 02:03:29.301
IMPACT ON MUNICIPALITIES. I WAS

02:03:29.368 --> 02:03:32.505
A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER FOR ALMOST

02:03:32.571 --> 02:03:34.540
TEN YEARS AS WELL, THAT WE NEED

02:03:34.607 --> 02:03:37.076
TO PROTECT THOSE WHO SERVE OUR

02:03:37.143 --> 02:03:38.177
CITIES AND OUR MUNICIPALITIES.

02:03:38.244 --> 02:03:40.112
SO I WILL BE VOTING FOR THIS AND

02:03:40.179 --> 02:03:42.214
WILL ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER ME AS

02:03:42.281 --> 02:03:44.316

TO INJURIES AND LIABILITY. AND I

02:04:18.117 --> 02:04:19.051

02:04:19.118 --> 02:04:21.020
TOWARD THAT DIRECTION. AND I

ALSO NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS

02:07:54.400 --> 02:07:56.335

02:07:56.402 --> 02:07:58.170
BILL IS MEANT TO BREAK THE SILOS

02:07:58.237 --> 02:07:59.605

02:08:10.649 --> 02:08:12.985
IS WHY THIS BILL IS SO IMPORTANT

02:08:13.052 --> 02:08:14.219

02:08:23.762 --> 02:08:24.897

02:08:34.573 --> 02:08:36.642
WE HAPPEN TO HAVE ANOTHER

02:09:01.900 --> 02:09:03.702
HAVE MET AND WORKED WITH SO MANY

02:09:03.769 --> 02:09:05.871

IN TRYING TO ADDRESS OUR

02:13:54.359 --> 02:13:56.661
CONCERNS. WE RECENTLY HAD

02:13:56.728 --> 02:13:57.662
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT AMENDMENTS

02:13:57.729 --> 02:13:59.264
THAT WE BELIEVE WOULD IMPROVE

02:13:59.331 --> 02:14:01.233
THE BILL, BUT AQUA WOULD STILL

02:14:01.299 --> 02:14:02.567
HAVE REMAINING CONCERNS AND

02:14:02.634 --> 02:14:04.403

IMPROVEMENTS TO WATER

02:14:07.506 --> 02:14:08.473
INFRASTRUCTURE BE STRUCK FROM

02:14:08.540 --> 02:14:10.776
THE BILL. PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES

02:14:10.842 --> 02:14:12.744
ARE TASKED WITH PROVIDING PUBLIC

02:14:12.811 --> 02:14:14.246
THE PUBLIC WITH SAFE AND

02:14:14.312 --> 02:14:16.081
RELIABLE DRINKING WATER. THESE

02:14:16.148 --> 02:14:17.416
WATER SYSTEMS WERE NOT DESIGNED

02:14:17.482 --> 02:14:18.984
TO COMBAT WILDFIRES, ESPECIALLY

02:14:19.050 --> 02:14:21.153
THE CLIMATE DRIVEN WILDFIRES.

02:14:21.219 --> 02:14:22.754
CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCES TODAY.

02:14:22.821 --> 02:14:23.889
THERE ARE CONCERNS THAT THE

02:14:23.955 --> 02:14:25.323
BILL'S PROPOSED COMMISSION, WITH

02:14:25.390 --> 02:14:27.526
A FOCUS ON FIRE INSURANCE AND

02:14:27.592 --> 02:14:28.894
WITH THE CURRENT LACK OF

02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:30.162
ADEQUATE REPRESENTATION FROM

02:14:30.228 --> 02:14:32.631
WATER AGENCIES, COULD CREATE

02:14:32.697 --> 02:14:33.765
STATEWIDE BEST PRACTICES FOR

02:14:33.832 --> 02:14:35.066
WATER INFRASTRUCTURE

02:14:35.133 --> 02:14:36.201
IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE NOT

02:14:36.268 --> 02:14:37.903
ALIGNED WITH WATER AGENCY'S

02:14:37.969 --> 02:14:39.404
OBJECTIVE OF PROVIDING SAFE AND

02:14:39.471 --> 02:14:41.339
RELIABLE DRINKING WATER. PUBLIC

02:14:41.406 --> 02:14:42.774
WATER AGENCIES ARE THE EXPERTS

02:14:42.841 --> 02:14:44.242
OF THEIR UNIQUE SYSTEMS, AND

02:14:44.309 --> 02:14:45.844
THEY ARE THE BEST ENTITY FOR

02:14:45.911 --> 02:14:47.179
DETERMINING WATER INFRASTRUCTURE

02:14:47.245 --> 02:14:48.780
NEEDS TO BEST SERVE THE

02:14:48.847 --> 02:14:50.148
COMMUNITIES THEY ARE ACCOUNTABLE

02:14:50.215 --> 02:14:52.050
TO. WE HAVE CONCERNS THAT

02:14:52.117 --> 02:14:53.385
STATEWIDE RECOMMENDATIONS WOULD

02:14:53.452 --> 02:14:55.253
NOT REFLECT THE COMPLEXITIES OF

02:14:55.320 --> 02:14:57.189
OUR WATER SYSTEMS AND THE VAST

02:14:57.255 --> 02:14:58.857
DIVERSITY OF CONDITIONS ACROSS

02:14:58.924 --> 02:15:00.959
OUR STATE. WATER AGENCIES HAVE

02:15:01.026 --> 02:15:02.294
ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS,

02:15:02.360 --> 02:15:03.895
INCLUDING MAINTAINING WATER

02:15:03.962 --> 02:15:05.297
QUALITY, FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS,

02:15:05.363 --> 02:15:07.432
AND OPERATIONAL REALITIES. THERE

02:15:07.499 --> 02:15:08.934
ARE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS THAT IF

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.036
WATER AGENCIES FAIL TO ADHERE TO

02:15:11.102 --> 02:15:12.370
THESE BEST PRACTICES DEVELOPED

02:15:12.437 --> 02:15:15.307
BY THE STATE, THERE WOULD BE A

02:15:15.373 --> 02:15:16.942
POTENTIAL INCREASED RISK TO

02:15:17.008 --> 02:15:18.677
LITIGATION FOLLOWING A WILDFIRE

02:15:18.743 --> 02:15:19.945
EVENT. COSTS FROM POTENTIAL

02:15:20.011 --> 02:15:21.246
LITIGATION WOULD ULTIMATELY FALL

02:15:21.313 --> 02:15:22.547
ON RATEPAYERS, RESULTING IN

02:15:22.614 --> 02:15:24.983
WATER AFFORDABILITY CONCERNS.

02:15:25.050 --> 02:15:25.684
ULTIMATELY, AQUA DOES NOT

02:15:25.750 --> 02:15:27.085
BELIEVE THAT THIS COMMISSION

02:15:27.152 --> 02:15:28.286
UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:15:28.353 --> 02:15:29.921
INSURANCE, IS THE RIGHT BODY TO

02:15:29.988 --> 02:15:31.623
BE MAKING RECOMMENDATION

02:15:31.690 --> 02:15:34.125
REGARDING CALIFORNIA'S WATER

02:15:34.192 --> 02:15:35.794
INFRASTRUCTURE, AND THAT THESE

02:15:35.861 --> 02:15:37.128
STATEWIDE RECOMMENDATIONS WOULD

02:15:37.195 --> 02:15:39.264
NOT BE APPLICABLE TO EACH WATER

02:15:39.331 --> 02:15:40.932
SYSTEM. FOR THESE REASONS, AND

02:15:40.999 --> 02:15:42.434
WITHOUT THE REQUESTED AMENDMENT

02:15:42.501 --> 02:15:43.401
TO REMOVE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE

02:15:43.468 --> 02:15:45.337
FROM THE BILL, WE ASK THE

02:15:45.403 --> 02:15:46.338
COMMITTEE TODAY TO VOTE NO.

02:15:46.404 --> 02:15:49.307
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. IS THERE

02:15:49.374 --> 02:15:50.075
ANY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION IN THE

02:15:50.141 --> 02:15:52.477
ROOM? PLEASE COME FORWARD, MADAM

02:15:52.544 --> 02:15:53.912
CHAIR BOB REEB WITH REEB

02:15:53.979 --> 02:15:55.080
GOVERNMENT RELATIONS ON BEHALF

02:15:55.146 --> 02:15:56.982
OF DESERT WATER AGENCY, WHICH IS

02:15:57.048 --> 02:15:58.483
A MEMBER OF THE ASSOCIATION OF

02:15:58.550 --> 02:15:59.885
CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES AND

02:15:59.951 --> 02:16:02.354
THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS

02:16:02.420 --> 02:16:05.023
ASSOCIATION, POSING AS AMENDED.

02:16:05.090 --> 02:16:06.057
THANK YOU. OKAY, I'M GOING TO

02:16:06.124 --> 02:16:08.193
BRING YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE.

02:16:08.260 --> 02:16:08.960
DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR

02:16:09.027 --> 02:16:13.398
COMMENTS FOR. THANK YOU. OKAY.

02:16:13.465 --> 02:16:15.433
SENATOR, WOULD YOU LIKE TO

02:16:15.500 --> 02:16:16.635
CLOSE? YES. THANK YOU. AND I

02:16:16.701 --> 02:16:18.737
JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE

02:16:18.803 --> 02:16:20.171
COMMENTS OF THE OPPOSITION. AND

02:16:20.238 --> 02:16:22.007
WE'VE BEEN HAVING A LOT OF

02:16:22.073 --> 02:16:23.375
CONVERSATIONS. AND I THINK THAT

02:16:23.441 --> 02:16:25.577
WE'VE DONE OUR DUE DILIGENCE OF

02:16:25.644 --> 02:16:27.379
REALLY ENGAGING. AND, YOU KNOW,

02:16:27.445 --> 02:16:29.614
THEY WANT A SEAT AT THE TABLE

02:16:29.681 --> 02:16:31.316
AND WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE

02:16:31.383 --> 02:16:32.884
OFFER TO CONSIDER, BUT THEY

02:16:32.951 --> 02:16:34.219
WOULD STILL REMAIN OPPOSED TO

02:16:34.286 --> 02:16:35.053
THAT. AND SO AT THIS POINT,

02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:37.122
WE'LL CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION.

02:16:37.188 --> 02:16:39.925
BUT I THINK THAT WATER IS A

02:16:39.991 --> 02:16:42.027
CRITICAL COMPONENT OF SOLVING

02:16:42.093 --> 02:16:43.728
THIS, THIS ISSUE. WE CAN'T HAVE

02:16:43.795 --> 02:16:45.430
A CONVERSATION ABOUT WILDFIRES

02:16:45.497 --> 02:16:47.465
WITHOUT THE WATER CONVERSATION,

02:16:47.532 --> 02:16:49.301
BUT THERE ARE NO MANDATES TO THE

02:16:49.367 --> 02:16:51.269
BILL ON WATER INFRASTRUCTURE,

02:16:51.336 --> 02:16:53.305
WHICH IS WHAT HAS BEEN STATED.

02:16:53.371 --> 02:16:55.473
IT JUST WE JUST WANT TO MAKE

02:16:55.540 --> 02:16:56.308
RECOMMENDATIONS. AND AS WE KNOW,

02:16:56.374 --> 02:16:58.777
WE CAN NO LONGER SIT BACK AND

02:16:58.843 --> 02:17:00.912
WATCH OUR COMMUNITIES BURN DOWN.

02:17:00.979 --> 02:17:02.614
WE KNOW THAT THESE OCCURRENCES

02:17:02.681 --> 02:17:05.150
ARE HAPPENING YEAR ROUND AND OUR

02:17:05.216 --> 02:17:05.784
COMMUNITIES NEED US. THEY NEED

02:17:05.850 --> 02:17:08.353
US TO STEP UP AND CREATE A

02:17:08.420 --> 02:17:11.990
REALLY COHESIVE POLICIES WITH

02:17:12.057 --> 02:17:13.825
EVERYONE AT THE TABLE. SO I WANT

02:17:13.892 --> 02:17:15.327
TO THANK MADAM CHAIR FOR

02:17:15.393 --> 02:17:16.027
ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT, BUT IT'S

02:17:16.094 --> 02:17:18.196

02:17:19.297 --> 02:17:20.865

02:17:20.932 --> 02:17:21.900
FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU.

02:17:21.967 --> 02:17:24.302

RENTERS, ETC, AND WE'RE JUST

02:28:45.783 --> 02:28:46.951
TRYING TO TAKE AWAY A BARRIER

02:28:47.018 --> 02:28:49.620
THAT HAS IMPACTED THE ABILITY OF

02:28:49.687 --> 02:28:54.692
FOLKS TO CHARGE IN THEIR HOMES.

02:28:54.759 --> 02:28:56.594
YOU KNOW, I AUTHORED A BILL BACK

02:28:56.661 --> 02:28:59.830
IN 2018, SB 1016, TO REMOVE MANY

02:28:59.897 --> 02:29:01.265
OF THE BURDENSOME POLICIES THAT

02:29:01.332 --> 02:29:02.400
PREVENTED THE INSTALLATION OF EV

02:29:02.466 --> 02:29:06.304
CHARGERS IN HOMES. BUT THE BILL

02:29:06.370 --> 02:29:08.172
DID NOT REMOVE THIS REQUIREMENT.

02:29:08.239 --> 02:29:09.440
ABOUT THE HOMEOWNER OBTAINING AN

02:29:09.507 --> 02:29:10.841
INSURANCE POLICY THAT NAMES HOA

02:29:10.908 --> 02:29:12.343
AS AN ADDITIONAL INSURED, AND

02:29:12.410 --> 02:29:15.212
THAT HAS BASICALLY MADE OUR

02:29:15.279 --> 02:29:17.114
EARLIER BILL MUCH LESS

02:29:17.181 --> 02:29:19.550
EFFECTIVE. SO WE'VE HAD

02:29:19.617 --> 02:29:20.217
SITUATIONS WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO

02:29:20.284 --> 02:29:21.752
HEAR ABOUT TODAY, CONSUMERS

02:29:21.819 --> 02:29:22.887
TRYING TO CONTACT A DOZEN

02:29:22.953 --> 02:29:24.155
INSURANCE AGENTS WITHOUT FINDING

02:29:24.221 --> 02:29:25.289
ANY THAT WOULD PROVIDE A POLICY

02:29:25.356 --> 02:29:26.824
THAT NAMES THE HOA AS AN

02:29:26.891 --> 02:29:27.992
ADDITIONAL INSURED. AND OTHERS

02:29:28.059 --> 02:29:29.794
HAVE BEEN TOLD THEIR PREMIUMS

02:29:29.860 --> 02:29:30.795
COULD INCREASE DRAMATICALLY. AND

02:29:30.861 --> 02:29:32.229
SO WE'RE JUST CONCERNED IF WE

02:29:32.296 --> 02:29:33.331
DON'T PASS SOMETHING LIKE THIS,

02:29:33.397 --> 02:29:35.099
THAT HOA RESIDENTS WILL BE

02:29:35.166 --> 02:29:36.100
PREVENTED FROM INSTALLING

02:29:36.167 --> 02:29:37.268
CHARGERS AND DISCOURAGE FROM

02:29:37.335 --> 02:29:39.136
MAKING THE SWITCH TO AN EV. SO

02:29:39.203 --> 02:29:41.539
WE HAVE CHARLIE CARRIER, WHO'S

02:29:41.605 --> 02:29:42.973
HERE, IS AN HOA RESIDENT FROM

02:29:43.040 --> 02:29:44.375
THE BAY AREA, AND BRANDON.

02:29:44.442 --> 02:29:46.477
BRANDON WONG FROM CALSTART ARE

02:29:46.544 --> 02:29:49.046
HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE

02:29:49.113 --> 02:29:53.451
BILL. OKAY. HI. MY NAME IS

02:29:53.517 --> 02:29:54.852
CHARLIE CARRIER, AND I'M A

02:29:54.919 --> 02:29:56.721
PUBLIC SERVANT AND CO-OP OWNER

02:29:56.787 --> 02:29:59.190
LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO. I

02:29:59.256 --> 02:30:01.325
ENCOURAGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON SB

02:30:01.392 --> 02:30:03.594
770, BECAUSE THE CURRENT RULE

02:30:03.661 --> 02:30:04.962
REQUIRING AN ASSOCIATION TO BE

02:30:05.029 --> 02:30:06.831
LISTED AS ADDITIONAL INSURED

02:30:06.897 --> 02:30:08.232
MAKES INSTALLING EV CHARGERS

02:30:08.299 --> 02:30:10.267
BOTH DIFFICULT AND COSTLY FOR

02:30:10.334 --> 02:30:11.969
CALIFORNIANS. I REACHED OUT TO

02:30:12.036 --> 02:30:13.938
THE SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL

02:30:14.004 --> 02:30:15.773
BECAUSE OF MY OWN FRUSTRATING

02:30:15.840 --> 02:30:17.274
EXPERIENCE TRYING TO COMPLY WITH

02:30:17.341 --> 02:30:20.878
EXISTING LAW. THIS YEAR, I HAVE

02:30:20.945 --> 02:30:22.146
TRIED TO INSTALL AN EV CHARGER

02:30:22.213 --> 02:30:23.948
IN MY PARKING SPACE. I ATTEMPTED

02:30:24.014 --> 02:30:26.183
TO GET MY ASSOCIATION, MY

02:30:26.250 --> 02:30:26.984
ASSOCIATION, LISTED AS

02:30:27.051 --> 02:30:28.452
ADDITIONAL INSURED THROUGH MY

02:30:28.519 --> 02:30:30.454
CURRENT PROVIDER, GEICO

02:30:30.521 --> 02:30:32.423
ASSURANT, BUT THEIR WEBSITE

02:30:32.490 --> 02:30:33.824
STATED PROMINENTLY THAT

02:30:33.891 --> 02:30:36.994
ASSOCIATIONS ARE, QUOTE, NEVER

02:30:37.061 --> 02:30:39.864
LISTED AS ADDITIONAL INSURED. IT

02:30:39.930 --> 02:30:41.699
CALLED TO MY INSURER CONFIRMED

02:30:41.766 --> 02:30:44.135
THIS AFTER ASKING AROUND OUR

02:30:44.201 --> 02:30:45.236
ASSOCIATION. NO ONE COULD

02:30:45.302 --> 02:30:46.704
IDENTIFY AN INSURER THAT WAS

02:30:46.771 --> 02:30:48.272
OFFERING THE TYPE OF POLICY THAT

02:30:48.339 --> 02:30:50.541
I NEEDED. INSTEAD, I WAS

02:30:50.608 --> 02:30:52.510
REFERRED TO INSURANCE BROKERS.

02:30:52.576 --> 02:30:54.278
THE FIRST BROKER I SPOKE TO SAID

02:30:54.345 --> 02:30:57.148
THAT THAT TO SECURE A POLICY

02:30:57.214 --> 02:30:58.082
WITH THE REQUIRED LANGUAGE, IT

02:30:58.149 --> 02:30:59.717
WOULD COST THREE TIMES MY

02:30:59.784 --> 02:31:03.187
CURRENT POLICY. I ULTIMATELY

02:31:03.254 --> 02:31:05.790
SECURED AN INFERIOR POLICY AT

02:31:05.856 --> 02:31:07.925
GREATER COSTS FROM A DIFFERENT

02:31:07.992 --> 02:31:10.461
BROKER. MY NEW POLICY COSTS 60%

02:31:10.528 --> 02:31:12.263
MORE THAN MY CURRENT POLICY,

02:31:12.329 --> 02:31:14.899
ALMOST $500 MORE PER YEAR, AND

02:31:14.965 --> 02:31:16.734
HAS A DEDUCTIBLE THAT IS FIVE

02:31:16.801 --> 02:31:19.370
TIMES MY OLD DEDUCTIBLE, WITH

02:31:19.437 --> 02:31:20.805
ONE FIFTH THE AMOUNT OF DWELLING

02:31:20.871 --> 02:31:23.040
COVERAGE THAT I HAD PREVIOUSLY.

02:31:23.107 --> 02:31:24.408
AT A TIME WHEN SUSTAINABLE

02:31:24.475 --> 02:31:25.843
ENERGY IS UNDER ATTACK AT THE

02:31:25.910 --> 02:31:28.112
FEDERAL LEVEL, AND CALIFORNIA

02:31:28.179 --> 02:31:29.480
POLITICIANS ARE RIGHTLY FOCUSED

02:31:29.547 --> 02:31:31.682
ON COST OF LIVING, NOW IS THE

02:31:31.749 --> 02:31:33.851
TIME TO REMOVE A CONFUSING AND

02:31:33.918 --> 02:31:35.586
EXPENSIVE OBSTACLE TO INSTALLING

02:31:35.653 --> 02:31:38.422
EV CHARGERS. PLEASE VOTE YES ON

02:31:38.489 --> 02:31:42.960
SB 770. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GO

02:31:43.027 --> 02:31:44.628
AHEAD. GOOD MORNING, MADAM CHAIR.

02:31:44.695 --> 02:31:45.896
BRANDON, ON BEHALF OF CAL

02:31:45.963 --> 02:31:47.898
STARTUP PASADENA BASED A GLOBAL

02:31:47.965 --> 02:31:48.466
NONPROFIT DEDICATED TO THE

02:31:48.532 --> 02:31:49.800
GROWTH OF THE CLEAN

02:31:49.867 --> 02:31:50.701
TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY. LIKE

02:31:50.768 --> 02:31:52.937
SENATOR MENTIONED, THIS BILL AT

02:31:53.003 --> 02:31:54.772
ITS CORE IS PRETTY SIMPLE IN

02:31:54.839 --> 02:31:56.574
THAT WE REALLY SEE THE INSURANCE

02:31:56.640 --> 02:31:58.042
DILEMMA AT THE HEART OF SB 770

02:31:58.108 --> 02:31:59.343
AS ONE OF THESE UNFORCED,

02:31:59.410 --> 02:32:00.010
UNINTENTIONAL BARRIERS FOR A LOT

02:32:00.077 --> 02:32:01.912
OF HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE SEEKING

02:32:01.979 --> 02:32:03.013
CONDOS AND TOWNHOUSES AND OTHER

02:32:03.080 --> 02:32:04.114
COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS AS

02:32:04.181 --> 02:32:05.583
A MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:32:05.649 --> 02:32:07.151
OPTION, THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO

02:32:07.218 --> 02:32:08.152
COUNT THAT THEY CAN CHARGE AT

02:32:08.219 --> 02:32:09.887
HOME. AND SO, ACCORDING TO THE

02:32:09.954 --> 02:32:12.089
CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION, AT

02:32:12.156 --> 02:32:12.723
HOME CHARGING, WHETHER IT'S IN A

02:32:12.790 --> 02:32:13.858
SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCE OR IN A

02:32:13.924 --> 02:32:15.993
MULTI-FAMILY BUILDING, IS GOING

02:32:16.060 --> 02:32:16.727
TO ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT 75% OF ALL

02:32:16.794 --> 02:32:18.329
OF OUR CHARGING NEEDS OVER THE

02:32:18.395 --> 02:32:19.663
NEXT DECADE. AND SO WE DO

02:32:19.730 --> 02:32:20.698
ANTICIPATE ABOUT A THIRD OF

02:32:20.764 --> 02:32:22.032
EVERY NEW CHARGE THAT NEEDS TO

02:32:22.099 --> 02:32:23.667
BE BUILT IN CALIFORNIA, NEEDS TO

02:32:23.734 --> 02:32:25.135
BE IN A MULTIFAMILY BUILDING,

02:32:25.202 --> 02:32:27.037
AND NOT ALL OF THAT IS GOING TO

02:32:27.104 --> 02:32:28.739
BE AT AT PUBLIC EXPENSE,

02:32:28.806 --> 02:32:29.740
ESSENTIALLY. RIGHT. AND SO

02:32:29.807 --> 02:32:30.341
INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS, AS THEY

02:32:30.407 --> 02:32:32.409
BUY THEIR NEW EV, ARE REALLY

02:32:32.476 --> 02:32:33.277
ENCOUNTERING THESE TYPES OF

02:32:33.344 --> 02:32:34.078
STRUGGLES AS THEY'RE TRYING TO

02:32:34.144 --> 02:32:35.813
CHARGE AT HOME. AND WE KNOW AT

02:32:35.880 --> 02:32:37.848
HOME CHARGING IS BOTH CHEAPER TO

02:32:37.915 --> 02:32:39.817
INSTALL. SO WE'RE ABLE TO GET TO

02:32:39.884 --> 02:32:42.052
OUR CLIMATE GOALS A LOT FASTER

02:32:42.119 --> 02:32:43.153
AND A LOT CHEAPER. AND IT'S ALSO

02:32:43.220 --> 02:32:44.154
CHEAPER FOR THE DRIVER BECAUSE

02:32:44.221 --> 02:32:44.989
THEY'RE ABLE TO CHARGE DURING

02:32:45.055 --> 02:32:46.790
OFF PEAK HOURS, WHICH CAN

02:32:46.857 --> 02:32:47.892
OFTENTIMES BE CHEAPER THAN

02:32:47.958 --> 02:32:49.159
PUBLIC FAST CHARGING. AND SO

02:32:49.226 --> 02:32:50.961
WE'VE GOTTEN A LOT OF PUBLIC

02:32:51.028 --> 02:32:51.462
FEEDBACK THROUGH OUR OWN

02:32:51.529 --> 02:32:52.663
INBOXES. AND I UNDERSTAND THE

02:32:52.730 --> 02:32:54.798
SENATOR HAS AS WELL IN TERMS OF

02:32:54.865 --> 02:32:55.266
INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS

02:32:55.332 --> 02:32:56.267
ENCOUNTERING THIS ISSUE. SO FOR

02:32:56.333 --> 02:32:57.601
THESE REASONS, WE URGE YOU FOR

02:32:57.668 --> 02:33:00.170
YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. THANK

BEHALF OF THE COMMUNITY

02:33:28.933 --> 02:33:31.068
ASSOCIATIONS INSTITUTE IN

02:33:31.135 --> 02:33:33.270
OPPOSITION TO THE BILL, WE'RE

02:33:33.337 --> 02:33:36.140
NOT IN OPPOSITION TO ELECTRIC

VEHICLES OR ELECTRIC VEHICLE

02:33:37.241 --> 02:33:38.609
CHARGERS. IN FACT, THE LAW HAS

02:33:38.676 --> 02:33:42.112
BEEN IN PLACE SINCE 2009,

02:33:42.179 --> 02:33:44.181
ALLOWING FOR A MEMBER OF THE

02:33:44.248 --> 02:33:45.215

02:33:45.282 --> 02:33:46.984
THE COMMUNITY PROPERTY.

02:33:47.051 --> 02:33:48.285
COMMUNITY PROPERTY MEANING OWNED

BY EVERYBODY, TO INSTALL A

02:33:51.655 --> 02:33:53.390
CHARGER. THEY DO NOT NEED

02:33:53.457 --> 02:33:54.725
PERMISSION FROM THE ASSOCIATION

02:33:54.792 --> 02:33:58.529
TO DO THAT. ALL WE NEED IS THAT

02:33:58.596 --> 02:33:59.897
CERTIFICATE OF ADDITIONAL

02:33:59.964 --> 02:34:02.132
INSURED. THIS HAS BEEN IN PLACE

02:34:02.199 --> 02:34:05.603
SINCE 2009. IN 2018 WE CAME AND

02:34:05.669 --> 02:34:09.673
WE DELETED THE $1 MILLION POLICY

02:34:09.740 --> 02:34:11.275
REQUIREMENT BECAUSE THAT WAS THE

02:34:11.342 --> 02:34:13.777
ISSUE. NOW THE ISSUE IS THE

02:34:13.844 --> 02:34:15.412
CERTIFICATE OF ADDITIONAL

02:34:15.479 --> 02:34:18.549
INSURED. I BEG TO DIFFER. THE

02:34:18.616 --> 02:34:21.385
ISSUE IS INSURANCE AND WHAT

02:34:21.452 --> 02:34:23.621
YOU'VE HEARD TODAY ABOUT THIS

02:34:23.687 --> 02:34:25.089
ONE INDIVIDUAL'S EXPERIENCE IS

02:34:25.155 --> 02:34:27.191
WHAT WE'RE AFRAID IS GOING TO

02:34:27.257 --> 02:34:28.025
HAPPEN TO ASSOCIATIONS ALL

02:34:28.092 --> 02:34:30.828
AROUND THE STATE. THERE ARE

02:34:30.894 --> 02:34:33.130
55,000 ASSOCIATIONS IN THE

02:34:33.197 --> 02:34:35.833
STATE, 60% OF THEM CONDOMINIUMS.

02:34:35.899 --> 02:34:39.470
WHEN THAT PREMIUM INCREASE IS

02:34:39.536 --> 02:34:41.538
TRANSFERRED FROM THAT INDIVIDUAL

02:34:41.605 --> 02:34:44.908
WHO PURCHASED AN EV, IT JUST

02:34:44.975 --> 02:34:48.112
DOESN'T GO AWAY. THE ENTIRE

02:34:48.178 --> 02:34:50.714
ASSOCIATION BEARS THAT COST.

02:34:50.781 --> 02:34:52.182
WE'VE SEEN ASSOCIATIONS AROUND

02:34:52.249 --> 02:34:56.086
THE STATE HAVE HUNDRED AND 200

02:34:56.153 --> 02:34:59.590
AND 300% INCREASES IN THEIR

02:34:59.657 --> 02:35:00.758
PREMIUMS. THEY'VE BEEN CANCELED.

02:35:00.824 --> 02:35:02.826
THEY'VE BEEN RENEWED. I JUST

02:35:02.893 --> 02:35:04.294
TESTIFIED IN SUPPORT OF A BILL

02:35:04.361 --> 02:35:06.530
PUTTING A MORATORIUM ON

02:35:06.597 --> 02:35:08.332
CANCELLATIONS, BECAUSE THE ISSUE

02:35:08.399 --> 02:35:11.835
IS SO DIRE FOR COMMUNITY

02:35:11.902 --> 02:35:13.671
ASSOCIATIONS. AND SO AN

02:35:13.737 --> 02:35:15.906
INDIVIDUAL WHO'S MAKING AN

02:35:15.973 --> 02:35:18.709
INDIVIDUAL CHOICE TO BUY AN EV

02:35:18.776 --> 02:35:20.511
AND PUT IT ON COMMUNITY

02:35:20.577 --> 02:35:22.413
PROPERTY, ALL WE'RE ASKING FOR

02:35:22.479 --> 02:35:24.882
THEM TO DO IS TO COVER THE

02:35:24.948 --> 02:35:26.984
INSURANCE. IF THEY DON'T DO IT,

02:35:27.051 --> 02:35:29.253
THEN WE JUST KNOW THAT WHEN WE

02:35:29.319 --> 02:35:31.722
GO BACK AND WE SHOW OUR

02:35:31.789 --> 02:35:32.990
INSURANCE PROVIDER THE FOLLOWING

02:35:33.057 --> 02:35:36.293
YEAR THAT WE NOW HAVE ONE, TWO,

02:35:36.360 --> 02:35:38.629
THREE ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGERS

02:35:38.696 --> 02:35:40.831
ON OUR PROPERTY, THAT'S GOING TO

02:35:40.898 --> 02:35:43.834
COME BACK TO OUR ASSOCIATION

02:35:43.901 --> 02:35:45.169
PREMIUMS. AND THEN THE ONLY WAY

02:35:45.235 --> 02:35:47.604
WE COVER THOSE ARE INCREASING

02:35:47.671 --> 02:35:49.373
ASSESSMENTS OR SPECIAL

02:35:49.440 --> 02:35:50.774
ASSESSMENTS. SO THIS IS ABOUT

02:35:50.841 --> 02:35:52.810
HOUSING AFFORDABILITY. THIS IS

02:35:52.876 --> 02:35:54.712
NOT ABOUT ELECTRIC VEHICLE

02:35:54.778 --> 02:35:56.246
CHARGERS. THIS IS ABOUT THE

02:35:56.313 --> 02:35:58.082
INSURANCE CRISIS THIS STATE IS

02:35:58.148 --> 02:35:59.450
FACING. THIS IS NOT ABOUT

02:35:59.516 --> 02:36:01.285
ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGERS. WE'VE

02:36:01.351 --> 02:36:02.653
TRIED TO FIND COMMON GROUND WITH

02:36:02.720 --> 02:36:04.755
THE SENATOR ON THIS ISSUE. WE'VE

02:36:04.822 --> 02:36:06.657
NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT. I'VE

02:36:06.724 --> 02:36:07.891
REQUESTED HIM TO MAKE IT A TWO

02:36:07.958 --> 02:36:10.194
YEAR BILL SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO

02:36:10.260 --> 02:36:12.196
WORK ON THAT. WE'VE NOT REACHED

02:36:12.262 --> 02:36:12.730
AGREEMENT ON THAT. WE ARE

02:36:12.796 --> 02:36:14.698
CONCERNED THAT THIS BILL PASSES.

02:36:14.765 --> 02:36:17.501
YOU WILL SEE INCREASES IN

02:36:17.568 --> 02:36:18.902
INSURANCE PREMIUMS TO YOUR

02:36:18.969 --> 02:36:20.304
CONDOMINIUM ASSOCIATIONS IN

02:36:20.370 --> 02:36:22.473
EVERY ONE OF YOUR DISTRICTS. AND

02:36:22.539 --> 02:36:25.476
BECAUSE OF THAT RISK, WE REMAIN

02:36:25.542 --> 02:36:26.343
IN OPPOSITION AND ASK YOU TO

02:36:26.410 --> 02:36:29.279
VOTE NO TODAY. OKAY. THANK YOU.

02:36:29.346 --> 02:36:30.948
IS THERE ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION

02:36:31.014 --> 02:36:32.416
IN THE ROOM? PLEASE COME

02:36:32.483 --> 02:36:34.151
FORWARD. OKAY. SEEING NONE, I'M

02:36:34.218 --> 02:36:34.952
GOING TO BRING IT BACK TO THE

02:36:35.018 --> 02:36:36.920
COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS. THANK

02:36:36.987 --> 02:36:38.155
YOU, MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU TO

02:36:38.222 --> 02:36:39.923
THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU TO THE

02:36:39.990 --> 02:36:41.125
TESTIFYING WITNESSES AND THE

02:36:41.191 --> 02:36:42.493
OPPOSITION. I WE SAW THIS IN

02:36:42.559 --> 02:36:44.194
JUDICIARY. WE'VE HAD

02:36:44.261 --> 02:36:45.562
CONVERSATIONS. I THINK THAT

02:36:45.629 --> 02:36:46.930
THERE ARE THERE ARE SOME VALID

02:36:46.997 --> 02:36:48.232
CONCERNS FROM THE OPPOSITION,

02:36:48.298 --> 02:36:50.934
FROM THE STANDPOINT OF WHO PAYS

02:36:51.001 --> 02:36:53.036
FOR THIS RISK. AND TO THE EXTENT

02:36:53.103 --> 02:36:56.273
THAT INSURANCE IS GOING TO GO UP

02:36:56.340 --> 02:36:57.508
FOR SOMEONE, WHETHER IT'S THE

02:36:57.574 --> 02:37:00.010
PERSON WHO'S USING THE CHARGER

02:37:00.077 --> 02:37:01.779
VERSUS THE ASSOCIATION AS A

02:37:01.845 --> 02:37:03.280
WHOLE, THE QUESTION THAT WE HAVE

02:37:03.347 --> 02:37:04.915
TO GRAPPLE WITH IS WHO? WHO

02:37:04.982 --> 02:37:06.049
SHOULD BEAR THAT COST? AND I

02:37:06.116 --> 02:37:07.918
GUESS I WOULD JUST LIKE FOR YOU

02:37:07.985 --> 02:37:10.087
TO RESPOND TO THAT, BECAUSE I

02:37:10.154 --> 02:37:10.821
THINK THAT WE'VE NOW TALKED

02:37:10.888 --> 02:37:11.889
ABOUT THIS THROUGH TWO

02:37:11.955 --> 02:37:12.990
COMMITTEES. I THINK IT'S A VALID

02:37:13.056 --> 02:37:15.025
CONCERN BECAUSE THIS IS JUST

02:37:15.092 --> 02:37:15.893
ABOUT ECONOMIC RATIONALITY. WHO

02:37:15.959 --> 02:37:16.960
SHOULD HAVE TO PAY? SHOULD IT BE

02:37:17.027 --> 02:37:19.296
ALL OF THE RESIDENTS, OR SHOULD

02:37:19.363 --> 02:37:19.997
IT JUST BE THE ONE RESIDENT

02:37:20.063 --> 02:37:21.265
THAT'S ACTUALLY BENEFITING FROM

02:37:21.331 --> 02:37:22.666
THE CHARGERS? SO I DON'T THINK

02:37:22.733 --> 02:37:24.101
THAT'S AN UNFAIR QUESTION. IT'S

02:37:24.168 --> 02:37:25.836
NOT AN UNFAIR QUESTION. I MEAN,

02:37:25.903 --> 02:37:27.137
I THINK THE CHALLENGE HERE IS I

02:37:27.204 --> 02:37:30.107
THINK THE HOPE ON OUR SIDE IS

02:37:30.174 --> 02:37:33.744
THAT WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR HERE

02:37:33.811 --> 02:37:37.748
IS SUCH A LOW RISK ACTIVITY TO

02:37:37.815 --> 02:37:41.318
BE INSURED. SO CERTAINLY I WOULD

02:37:41.385 --> 02:37:42.786
I WOULD BE TERRIBLE IF WHAT THE

02:37:42.853 --> 02:37:45.322
WAY THAT LOUIS HAS DESCRIBED THE

02:37:45.389 --> 02:37:47.825
OUTCOME WOULD ACTUALLY COME TO

02:37:47.891 --> 02:37:49.059
FRUITION. IT'S HARD FOR ME TO

02:37:49.126 --> 02:37:53.096
BELIEVE IT BECAUSE OF HOW LOW

02:37:53.163 --> 02:37:57.234
RISK THIS, THIS TECHNOLOGY IS.

02:37:57.301 --> 02:37:58.502
WHEN THE INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS

02:37:58.569 --> 02:38:00.404
WERE FIRST DISCUSSED YEARS AND

02:38:00.470 --> 02:38:02.272
YEARS AGO, WE HAD SO LITTLE

02:38:02.339 --> 02:38:04.408
EXPERIENCE WITH CHARGERS AND

02:38:04.474 --> 02:38:06.844
THERE WAS WE JUST DIDN'T KNOW.

02:38:06.910 --> 02:38:09.379
BUT THERE HAVEN'T. THESE ARE NOT

02:38:09.446 --> 02:38:11.215
AND THEY DON'T THEY DON'T KIND

02:38:11.281 --> 02:38:13.650
OF SPONTANEOUSLY COMBUST. THE

02:38:13.717 --> 02:38:15.619
WORST SCENARIO THAT WE'VE HEARD

02:38:15.686 --> 02:38:18.055
IS MAYBE SOMEONE LEAVES THE LINE

02:38:18.121 --> 02:38:20.557
OUT AND SOMEONE TRIPS OVER IT. I

02:38:20.624 --> 02:38:21.625
MEAN, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN

02:38:21.692 --> 02:38:23.093
HAPPEN WITH ANYTHING IN A SHARED

02:38:23.160 --> 02:38:26.296
PARKING SPACE. SO IT'S MY

02:38:26.363 --> 02:38:30.267
FERVENT HOPE HERE THAT THIS IS

02:38:30.334 --> 02:38:31.001
JUST GOING TO BE A RELATIVELY

02:38:31.068 --> 02:38:34.638
EASY ADD ON ONCE WE CREATE MORE

02:38:34.705 --> 02:38:35.772
MATURITY IN THE MARKET. AND

02:38:35.839 --> 02:38:37.107
THAT'S WHAT I'M SEEKING TO PUSH

02:38:37.174 --> 02:38:39.309
HERE. I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND AND

02:38:39.376 --> 02:38:41.478
RESPECT LOUIS POSITION HERE, AND

02:38:41.545 --> 02:38:43.380
IT'S PAINFUL THAT WE'RE YOU

02:38:43.447 --> 02:38:45.315
KNOW, AND I GUESS THE FLIP SIDE

02:38:45.382 --> 02:38:46.884
ARGUMENT IS, WELL, SHOULD WE

02:38:46.950 --> 02:38:48.285
SHOULD WE THEN REQUIRE THIS TO

02:38:48.352 --> 02:38:51.521
BE A, A PRODUCT ON ON THE

02:38:51.588 --> 02:38:52.856
INSURANCE SIDE? WE'VE HAD THOSE

02:38:52.923 --> 02:38:53.957
CONVERSATIONS. I KNOW THAT'S

02:38:54.024 --> 02:38:55.158
PROBABLY YOUR POSITION.

02:38:55.225 --> 02:38:56.059
OBVIOUSLY THE INSURANCE FOLKS

02:38:56.126 --> 02:39:01.231
PUSH BACK. SO I'M I, I DON'T

02:39:01.298 --> 02:39:05.135
HAVE A I RECOGNIZE THIS IS AN

02:39:05.202 --> 02:39:06.703
IMPERFECT SOLUTION. WE'RE TRYING

02:39:06.770 --> 02:39:08.105
TO MAKE IT SO THAT FOLKS LIVING

02:39:08.171 --> 02:39:11.275
IN HOAS CAN CAN GET AN EV AND

02:39:11.341 --> 02:39:13.043
CHARGE IT AT THEIR HOUSE. AND

02:39:13.110 --> 02:39:16.079
THIS HAS BECOME A BARRIER. I

02:39:16.146 --> 02:39:17.781
KNOW IT POTENTIALLY PUTS A

02:39:17.848 --> 02:39:20.317
BURDEN ON THE HOA. I HOPE IT

02:39:20.384 --> 02:39:23.086
DOESN'T. AND IF FOLKS HAVE IDEAS

02:39:23.153 --> 02:39:26.123
ABOUT WAYS TO HONE THIS SO AS TO

02:39:26.189 --> 02:39:27.991
MITIGATE RISK FURTHER, I'M SO

02:39:28.058 --> 02:39:29.927
OPEN TO THAT. I YOU KNOW, HE'S

02:39:29.993 --> 02:39:30.761
DEFENDING HIS FOLKS AND I

02:39:30.827 --> 02:39:32.930
RESPECT HIM FOR IT. I IT'S HARD

02:39:32.996 --> 02:39:34.031
FOR ME TO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS

02:39:34.097 --> 02:39:36.833
GOING TO BE ANYWHERE NEAR AS BAD

02:39:36.900 --> 02:39:38.201
AS HAS BEEN DESCRIBED, GIVEN HOW

02:39:38.268 --> 02:39:40.604
LOW THE RISK IS ASSOCIATED WITH

02:39:40.671 --> 02:39:42.339
THE INSTALLATION OF THESE

02:39:42.406 --> 02:39:44.875
CHARGERS. BUT I, YOU KNOW, I, I

02:39:44.942 --> 02:39:47.377
DON'T DISCOUNT THE POSSIBILITY

02:39:47.444 --> 02:39:49.179
THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BY MY

02:39:49.246 --> 02:39:51.214
FRIEND MR. BROWN. AND I KNOW,

02:39:51.281 --> 02:39:52.582
YOU KNOW, THIS IS YOU'RE THE

02:39:52.649 --> 02:39:54.952
INSURANCE COMMITTEE. YOU HAVE

02:39:55.018 --> 02:39:56.620
EXPERTISE IN THIS AREA. IF

02:39:56.687 --> 02:39:58.155
YOU'VE GOT IDEAS AS TO HOW TO

02:39:58.221 --> 02:40:00.757
BETTER HONE. I'M I'M SO OPEN TO

02:40:00.824 --> 02:40:03.627
THOSE IDEAS. YEAH. THANK YOU,

02:40:03.694 --> 02:40:04.828
MADAM CHAIR. I APPRECIATE THAT

02:40:04.895 --> 02:40:06.029
AND JUST HOW THOUGHTFUL YOU

02:40:06.096 --> 02:40:07.531
ALWAYS ARE WITH YOUR BILLS,

02:40:07.597 --> 02:40:09.232
INCLUDING THIS ONE. I THINK THE

02:40:09.299 --> 02:40:10.334
CONCERN IS OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE

02:40:10.400 --> 02:40:11.768
TESTIFYING WITNESS WHAT HE WENT

02:40:11.835 --> 02:40:13.971
THROUGH AND JUST HOW MUCH HE HAD

02:40:14.037 --> 02:40:16.873
TO PAY FOR THIS LIMITED POLICY.

02:40:16.940 --> 02:40:18.008
I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU. THIS

02:40:18.075 --> 02:40:20.444
DOES NOT SEEM LIKE A HUGE RISK.

02:40:20.510 --> 02:40:21.945
HOWEVER, I'M GOING TO USE THAT

02:40:22.012 --> 02:40:22.813
TESTIMONY AND I'M GOING TO

02:40:22.879 --> 02:40:25.148
BELIEVE HIM. IT WAS IN THE

02:40:25.215 --> 02:40:26.016
MARKET, QUITE A BIG DIFFERENCE

02:40:26.083 --> 02:40:27.684
IN HIS INSURANCE POLICY, SO IT'S

02:40:27.751 --> 02:40:29.853
HARD FOR ME TO BELIEVE THAT THE

02:40:29.920 --> 02:40:30.887
HOA POLICIES WILL NOT BE

02:40:30.954 --> 02:40:31.788
AFFECTED. I'M NOT SURE WHERE THE

02:40:31.855 --> 02:40:33.056
INSURANCE. THEY WERE SITTING

02:40:33.123 --> 02:40:34.925
HERE ALL DAY. I'M NOT SURE IF

02:40:34.992 --> 02:40:36.593
ANYONE'S HERE, BUT I WOULD HAVE

02:40:36.660 --> 02:40:37.928
LOVED TO HAVE HEARD FROM THEM AS

02:40:37.995 --> 02:40:40.130
TO WHAT THEY THINK IS GOING TO

02:40:40.197 --> 02:40:41.264
HAPPEN IN THE MARKET. I'M GOING

02:40:41.331 --> 02:40:43.166
TO SUPPORT IT OUT OF COMMITTEE

02:40:43.233 --> 02:40:44.234
TODAY. SENATOR ALLEN, AND I DO

02:40:44.301 --> 02:40:45.869
THINK THAT THIS IS A REAL THIS

02:40:45.936 --> 02:40:48.305
IS A REAL ISSUE THAT I HOPE YOU

02:40:48.372 --> 02:40:50.574
GUYS CAN LAND THE PLANE WITH THE

02:40:50.640 --> 02:40:51.241
INSURANCE COMPANIES, BECAUSE TO

02:40:51.308 --> 02:40:52.743
THE EXTENT THAT ONE INDIVIDUAL

02:40:52.809 --> 02:40:53.944
IS GOING THROUGH THIS, I THINK

02:40:54.011 --> 02:40:55.645
THE HOA IS GOING TO GO THROUGH

02:40:55.712 --> 02:40:57.014
IT TOO. AND I THINK IT'S

02:40:57.080 --> 02:40:58.949
SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE COGNIZANT

02:40:59.016 --> 02:40:59.649
OF. SO I APPRECIATE YOU

02:40:59.716 --> 02:41:00.851
CONSIDERING THAT. AND I WILL

02:41:00.917 --> 02:41:02.586
MOVE THE BILL AND SUPPORT IT

02:41:02.652 --> 02:41:03.920
TODAY. BUT IT IS AN ISSUE. YEAH.

02:41:03.987 --> 02:41:06.056
I MEAN MY HOPE HERE AND MAYBE,

02:41:06.123 --> 02:41:07.791
MAYBE, MAYBE THIS IS TERRIBLY

02:41:07.858 --> 02:41:09.693
NAIVE I DON'T KNOW. BUT THIS IS

02:41:09.760 --> 02:41:11.762
GOING TO BE KIND OF LIKE, YOU

02:41:11.828 --> 02:41:13.030
KNOW, MAYBE I'LL REGRET BRINGING

02:41:13.096 --> 02:41:14.197
THIS UP, BUT LIKE SOLAR, RIGHT?

02:41:14.264 --> 02:41:15.565
I MEAN, SOLAR WAS INCREDIBLY

02:41:15.632 --> 02:41:17.334
EXPENSIVE. WE PUT IN PLACE

02:41:17.401 --> 02:41:19.736
SYSTEMS TO DECREASE THE COST,

02:41:19.803 --> 02:41:21.972
AND OVER TIME IT SCALED AND

02:41:22.039 --> 02:41:24.541
PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO PURCHASE IT,

02:41:24.608 --> 02:41:26.076
THAT IF WE IF WE PUSH THE

02:41:26.143 --> 02:41:26.977
ENVELOPE HERE, IT WILL JUST

02:41:27.044 --> 02:41:29.679
BECOME LIKE A NO BRAINER ADD ON

02:41:29.746 --> 02:41:32.149
THAT WILL ADD MINIMAL COST ONTO

02:41:32.215 --> 02:41:33.884
THE ONTO THE POLICIES. BUT I

02:41:33.950 --> 02:41:35.786
TOTALLY LISTEN. I, I UNDERSTAND

02:41:35.852 --> 02:41:39.156
THAT IT'S A IT'S A IT PUTS OUR

02:41:39.222 --> 02:41:40.791
FRIENDS FROM THE HOA COMMUNITY

02:41:40.857 --> 02:41:41.825
IN A NERVOUS PLACE BECAUSE

02:41:41.892 --> 02:41:43.927
THERE'S NO GUARANTEE. AGAIN,

02:41:43.994 --> 02:41:45.762
WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE A

02:41:45.829 --> 02:41:48.698
SCENARIO WHICH WILL LEAD TO MORE

02:41:48.765 --> 02:41:50.100
AFFORDABLE, MORE WORKABLE

02:41:50.167 --> 02:41:51.868
ADOPTION OF EVS. WE KNOW THAT

02:41:51.935 --> 02:41:54.271
THE INSTALLATION OF THESE

02:41:54.337 --> 02:41:55.672
CHARGERS PRODUCES MINIMAL,

02:41:55.739 --> 02:41:57.607
REALLY DE MINIMIS RISK. I MEAN,

02:41:57.674 --> 02:41:59.142
THIS TECHNOLOGY'S BEEN OUT THERE

02:41:59.209 --> 02:42:02.045
FOR YEARS NOW. BUT IF THERE IF

02:42:02.112 --> 02:42:04.014
THERE ARE FOLKS FROM THE

02:42:04.081 --> 02:42:05.015
INDUSTRY THAT WANT TO SPEAK, WE

02:42:05.082 --> 02:42:06.683
CERTAINLY HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH

02:42:06.750 --> 02:42:07.851
THEM. WE ALL TALKED TO THEM

02:42:07.918 --> 02:42:08.885
TOGETHER WHO WANT TO SPEAK TO

02:42:08.952 --> 02:42:11.388
THIS ISSUE. I WELCOME THEM TO

02:42:11.455 --> 02:42:11.988
THE MICROPHONE. ASSEMBLYWOMAN

02:42:12.055 --> 02:42:14.224
NGUYEN, THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR,

02:42:14.291 --> 02:42:15.792
AND THANK YOU, ASSEMBLY MEMBER,

02:42:15.859 --> 02:42:16.960
BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO ASK THE

02:42:17.027 --> 02:42:18.895
SAME QUESTION. I FEEL LIKE I

02:42:18.962 --> 02:42:20.263
FEEL LIKE THE QUESTION WASN'T

02:42:20.330 --> 02:42:21.164
ANSWERED BECAUSE I'M NOT QUITE

02:42:21.231 --> 02:42:23.200
SURE STILL, WHO'S GOING TO BEAR

02:42:23.266 --> 02:42:25.368
THIS COST. AND I ALSO WANT TO

02:42:25.435 --> 02:42:27.537
KNOW, WAS THIS AN ISSUE IN

02:42:27.604 --> 02:42:28.672
JUDICI AND IT DIDN'T GET

02:42:28.738 --> 02:42:29.806
RESOLVED. AND NOW IT'S CARRYING

02:42:29.873 --> 02:42:31.842
OVER TO HERE. IT SOUNDS LIKE IT

02:42:31.908 --> 02:42:33.944
WAS AND IT'S STILL AN ISSUE. AND

02:42:34.010 --> 02:42:35.345
HAVE THERE BEEN AMENDMENTS THAT

02:42:35.412 --> 02:42:38.682
WERE SENT? I HEAR YOU, SENATOR.

02:42:38.748 --> 02:42:40.550
FOLKS HAVE IDEAS, BUT THIS

02:42:40.617 --> 02:42:42.052
SHOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPENING

02:42:42.119 --> 02:42:43.820
BEFORE IT CAME TO US TO TALK

02:42:43.887 --> 02:42:44.855
ABOUT. OF COURSE WE'VE BEEN

02:42:44.921 --> 02:42:46.490
DISCUSSING IT. YEAH. WE HAVE. I

02:42:46.556 --> 02:42:47.757
MEAN, QUITE FRANKLY, THERE

02:42:47.824 --> 02:42:54.131
HASN'T BEEN A, YOU KNOW, I THINK

02:42:54.197 --> 02:42:55.165
OF COURSE, WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING

02:42:55.232 --> 02:42:57.300
IT. WE JUST HAVE WE I THINK THAT

02:42:57.367 --> 02:42:59.569
THERE'S A I THINK THAT, YOU

02:42:59.636 --> 02:43:03.607
KNOW, MR. BROWN IS HIS JOB IS TO

02:43:03.673 --> 02:43:05.642
LOOK OUT FOR WORST CASE

02:43:05.709 --> 02:43:08.111
SCENARIOS FOR HIS CLIENTS AND

02:43:08.178 --> 02:43:10.714
HAS BEEN CORRECTLY BRINGING

02:43:10.780 --> 02:43:12.182
THOSE, THOSE CONCERNS TO THE

02:43:12.249 --> 02:43:16.853
FORE. IT'S OUR POSITION THAT

02:43:16.920 --> 02:43:19.256
WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR HERE IS

02:43:19.322 --> 02:43:20.690
REASONABLE, THAT IT'S NOT GOING

02:43:20.757 --> 02:43:24.094
TO LEAD TO THE KINDS OF

02:43:24.161 --> 02:43:25.495
INCREASES THAT HE'S WORRIED

02:43:25.562 --> 02:43:27.998
ABOUT. YOU KNOW, FROM MY

02:43:28.064 --> 02:43:31.701
PERSPECTIVE, THAT POSITION MAKES

02:43:31.768 --> 02:43:34.137
SENSE BECAUSE OF THE LOW RISK

02:43:34.204 --> 02:43:36.573
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY

02:43:36.640 --> 02:43:39.209
AND THE LONG TRACK RECORD OF USE

02:43:39.276 --> 02:43:43.346
OF THIS TECHNOLOGY WITH NO

02:43:43.413 --> 02:43:45.015
INCIDENTS THAT WE CAN POINT TO

02:43:45.081 --> 02:43:48.451
THAT WOULD LEAD TO THE NEED FOR

02:43:48.518 --> 02:43:51.488
HIGH COST ASSOCIATED WITH

02:43:51.555 --> 02:43:52.789
INSURANCE. I THINK WHAT'S

02:43:52.856 --> 02:43:54.024
HAPPENED HERE IS THAT THERE'S

02:43:54.090 --> 02:43:57.093
IT'S JUST NOT A IT'S A IT'S A

02:43:57.160 --> 02:44:00.764
IT'S A NASCENT MARKET. AND THE

02:44:00.830 --> 02:44:06.970
QUESTION OF HOA RESIDENTS AND.

02:44:07.037 --> 02:44:08.505
AND THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS

02:44:08.572 --> 02:44:10.073
JUST NOT COME FORWARD WITH THE

02:44:10.140 --> 02:44:11.675
PRODUCT YET. YEAH. YEAH. PLEASE.

02:44:11.741 --> 02:44:13.610
YEAH. SO JUST JUST TO BE CLEAR,

02:44:13.677 --> 02:44:15.879
MY COSTS DID NOT INCREASE

02:44:15.946 --> 02:44:17.781
BECAUSE I PROPOSED TO INSTALL AN

02:44:17.847 --> 02:44:20.450
EV CHARGER. THEY INCREASED

02:44:20.517 --> 02:44:23.587
BECAUSE I HAD TO FIND A BESPOKE

02:44:23.653 --> 02:44:26.723
INSURER THAT WOULD ADD MY HOA AS

02:44:26.790 --> 02:44:29.859
ADDITIONAL INSURED. SO JUST THE

02:44:29.926 --> 02:44:31.728
INSURER HAD NO IDEA THAT I WAS

02:44:31.795 --> 02:44:32.929
PLANNING TO INSTALL AN EV

02:44:32.996 --> 02:44:36.066
CHARGER. SO, SO TO, TO TIE MY

02:44:36.132 --> 02:44:39.669
COSTS TO THE FACT THAT I WAS

02:44:39.736 --> 02:44:41.871
INSTALLING AN EV CHARGER IS NOT

02:44:41.938 --> 02:44:45.175
ACCURATE. IT HAD TO DO WITH THIS

02:44:45.242 --> 02:44:46.810
REQUIREMENT THAT AN INSURER LIKE

02:44:46.876 --> 02:44:48.912
GEICO AND ASSURANT, A MAJOR

02:44:48.979 --> 02:44:50.680
INSURER, HAD NO. LIKE JUST SAID

02:44:50.747 --> 02:44:55.018
THEY WOULDN'T DO. JUST WANT TO

02:44:55.085 --> 02:44:57.621
MAKE THAT CLEAR. MADAM CHAIR,

02:44:57.687 --> 02:45:02.659
MAY I? YES, A COUPLE ISSUES IS

02:45:02.726 --> 02:45:03.960
FIRST THE QUESTION OF WHO DOES

02:45:04.027 --> 02:45:06.296
PAY FOR THIS. IF YOU'RE AN

02:45:06.363 --> 02:45:08.765
ASSOCIATION OF 100 ASSOCIATION

02:45:08.832 --> 02:45:11.001
MEMBERS AND ONE PERSON GETS AN

02:45:11.067 --> 02:45:13.837
EV CHARGER, NOW ALL 100 ARE

02:45:13.903 --> 02:45:15.605
PAYING FOR THOSE POTENTIAL

02:45:15.672 --> 02:45:17.774
INCREASES IN INSURANCE, NOT JUST

02:45:17.841 --> 02:45:20.243
THE ONE. THAT'S THE WAY THE

02:45:20.310 --> 02:45:23.847
ASSOCIATION WORLD WORKS. WE HAVE

02:45:23.913 --> 02:45:25.348
COMMUNICATED WITH THREE OF THE

02:45:25.415 --> 02:45:26.650
MAJOR CARRIERS IN THE STATE.

02:45:26.716 --> 02:45:29.319
STATE FARM. TRAVELERS AND TRIPLE

02:45:29.386 --> 02:45:32.188
A WHO ALL PROVIDE THESE

02:45:32.255 --> 02:45:34.357
CERTIFICATES. WHEN ASKED ON THE

02:45:34.424 --> 02:45:36.459
COMMERCIAL SIDE, CERTIFICATES OF

02:45:36.526 --> 02:45:38.028
ADDITIONAL INSURED ARE JUST PART

02:45:38.094 --> 02:45:40.130
OF DOING BUSINESS. IF YOU'RE A

02:45:40.196 --> 02:45:41.531
LANDSCAPER, IF YOU'RE DOING A

02:45:41.598 --> 02:45:43.333
CONSTRUCTION JOB ON ASSOCIATION,

02:45:43.400 --> 02:45:45.602
BEFORE YOU GET THE CONTRACT, YOU

02:45:45.669 --> 02:45:47.270
PROVIDE A CERTIFICATE OF

02:45:47.337 --> 02:45:48.405
ADDITIONAL INSURED. THIS IS

02:45:48.471 --> 02:45:49.906
SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS IN THE

02:45:49.973 --> 02:45:52.976
INSURANCE INDUSTRY ALL THE TIME.

02:45:53.043 --> 02:45:55.912
AND SO AGAIN, IT HAPPENS IN

02:45:55.979 --> 02:45:57.714
VARIOUS CASES. IF IT'S NOT

02:45:57.781 --> 02:45:59.883
HAPPENING IN THIS SPACE, THEN WE

02:45:59.949 --> 02:46:03.219
QUESTION WHY. AND UNTIL WE

02:46:03.286 --> 02:46:05.455
UNDERSTAND WHY. AND WE CAN BE

02:46:05.522 --> 02:46:07.023
ASSURED THAT THOSE COST

02:46:07.090 --> 02:46:08.158
INCREASES AREN'T GOING TO BE

02:46:08.224 --> 02:46:10.460
BORNE BY EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE

02:46:10.527 --> 02:46:12.028
ASSOCIATION. THOSE WHO DON'T

02:46:12.095 --> 02:46:14.631
HAVE AN EV, THEN WE DON'T WANT

02:46:14.698 --> 02:46:16.266
TO ASSUME THE RISK. AND I DON'T

02:46:16.333 --> 02:46:19.803
THINK THAT'S UNFAIR. JUST JUST A

02:46:19.869 --> 02:46:24.074
POINT. OH, SORRY. GO AHEAD. WHEN

02:46:24.140 --> 02:46:26.376
I LOOKED INTO GETTING INSURANCE,

02:46:26.443 --> 02:46:29.279
STATE FARM AND TRIPLE A WILL NOT

02:46:29.346 --> 02:46:33.049
WRITE POLICIES IN SAN FRANCISCO.

02:46:33.116 --> 02:46:38.154
OKAY. THANK YOU. I, I HAVE A LOT

02:46:38.221 --> 02:46:40.623
OF CONCERNS. I, I APPRECIATE

02:46:40.690 --> 02:46:43.226
YOUR THOUGHTFULNESS ABOUT HOW

02:46:43.293 --> 02:46:45.662
SAFE THE TECHNOLOGY IS. MY

02:46:45.729 --> 02:46:47.831
CONCERN IS I LIVE IN A VERY FIRE

02:46:47.897 --> 02:46:48.898
PRONE AREA, SO IT'S NOT

02:46:48.965 --> 02:46:50.333
NECESSARILY THE COST THAT THE

02:46:50.400 --> 02:46:52.102
RISK THAT THAT TECHNOLOGY HAS.

02:46:52.168 --> 02:46:53.670
IT'S THE RISK OF REPLACING IT

02:46:53.737 --> 02:46:55.805
FOR THOSE NATURAL DISASTERS,

02:46:55.872 --> 02:46:57.841
FLOODS, FIRES. WE HAVE

02:46:57.907 --> 02:47:00.343
EVERYTHING IN MY DISTRICT. HAVE

02:47:00.410 --> 02:47:02.612
YOU TALKED TO INSURERS ABOUT

02:47:02.679 --> 02:47:04.280
THAT OR THE POTENTIAL COSTS FOR

02:47:04.347 --> 02:47:06.216
I MEAN, MY PEOPLE ARE GETTING

02:47:06.282 --> 02:47:08.017
CANCELED RIGHT AND LEFT AND

02:47:08.084 --> 02:47:09.519
THEIR THEIR POLICIES HAVE GONE

02:47:09.586 --> 02:47:11.855
UP THREE, 400%. OH YEAH. THEY

02:47:11.921 --> 02:47:14.224
CANNOT AFFORD ANOTHER TAKE. AND

02:47:14.290 --> 02:47:16.226
HONESTLY, IF ONE PERSON CAME

02:47:16.292 --> 02:47:19.396
WITH AN EV IN THE HOA, THEY'RE

02:47:19.462 --> 02:47:21.231
I'M GOING TO HEAR ABOUT IT EVERY

02:47:21.297 --> 02:47:24.868
DAY IF THEY ALL HAVE TO PAY FOR

02:47:24.934 --> 02:47:27.404
THAT BECAUSE OF THIS, THIS BILL.

02:47:27.470 --> 02:47:29.272
THE REASON WHY, I MEAN, WE I'M

02:47:29.339 --> 02:47:30.840
IN A FIRE PRONE AREA TOO, RIGHT?

02:47:30.907 --> 02:47:32.742
I, I REPRESENT THE PALISADES.

02:47:32.809 --> 02:47:34.377
LET'S BE REAL CLEAR. THE REASON

02:47:34.444 --> 02:47:35.612
WHY OUR OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE

02:47:35.678 --> 02:47:36.746
HAVING TROUBLE GETTING INSURANCE

02:47:36.813 --> 02:47:38.581
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH FOLKS

02:47:38.648 --> 02:47:40.283
WANTING TO PUT EV CHARGERS IN

02:47:40.350 --> 02:47:42.786
HOA PARKING LOTS. IT'S ALL THE

02:47:42.852 --> 02:47:44.354
RISKS THAT WE TALK ABOUT IN THIS

02:47:44.421 --> 02:47:46.956
COMMITTEE EVERY, EVERY WEEK. SO

02:47:47.023 --> 02:47:48.858
YOU KNOW, AGAIN, BOTH OF BOTH

02:47:48.925 --> 02:47:51.127
THE ANALYZES FROM JUDICIARY AND

02:47:51.194 --> 02:47:53.696
INSURANCE HAVE SPOKEN TO THE LOW

02:47:53.763 --> 02:47:55.799
RISK ASSOCIATED HERE. I THINK

02:47:55.865 --> 02:47:58.334
THAT, YOU KNOW, THE CONCERNS ARE

02:47:58.401 --> 02:48:00.136
ARE I THINK I THINK MR. BROWN'S

02:48:00.203 --> 02:48:01.905
DOING HIS JOB IN TERMS OF

02:48:01.971 --> 02:48:03.006
RAISING THE CONCERNS. BUT AGAIN,

02:48:03.072 --> 02:48:05.141
THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THIS

02:48:05.208 --> 02:48:07.944
PARTICULAR ASK IN THIS BILL IS

02:48:08.011 --> 02:48:09.212
NOT THE COST DRIVER. IT'S NOT

02:48:09.279 --> 02:48:11.314
THE AVAILABILITY DRIVER THAT

02:48:11.381 --> 02:48:13.483
THAT YOU'RE SPEAKING TO. BUT

02:48:13.550 --> 02:48:14.918
THEN THAT INSURANCE COMPANY IS

02:48:14.984 --> 02:48:16.186
GOING TO HAVE TO REPLACE THAT.

02:48:16.252 --> 02:48:18.087
SO IF WE LET THEM PUT IT IN, THE

02:48:18.154 --> 02:48:19.255
INSURANCE COMPANY ITSELF IS

02:48:19.322 --> 02:48:21.524
GOING TO HAVE TO REPLACE THAT.

02:48:21.591 --> 02:48:23.059
IF WE HAVE A WILDFIRE THERE OR A

02:48:23.126 --> 02:48:24.327
FLOOD. RIGHT. SO THOSE DAMAGES,

02:48:24.394 --> 02:48:26.162
NO MATTER WHAT, IT'S GOING TO BE

02:48:26.229 --> 02:48:28.064
EXPENSIVE TO REPLACE IT. SO THE

02:48:28.131 --> 02:48:29.265
HOA IS GOING TO HAVE THAT COST

02:48:29.332 --> 02:48:33.203
OR THE OWNER ON THE. SO THE

02:48:33.269 --> 02:48:36.039
OWNER THE COST OF REPLACING WHAT

02:48:36.105 --> 02:48:39.709
THE REPLACING THE UNIT THE

02:48:39.776 --> 02:48:41.811
REPLACING IT. YEAH. LIKE IF WHAT

02:48:41.878 --> 02:48:43.246
UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES. LIKE

02:48:43.313 --> 02:48:46.382
IT BURNS UP IN A FIRE. SO THAT'S

02:48:46.449 --> 02:48:48.351
WHAT THEY'RE INSURING RIGHT IS

02:48:48.418 --> 02:48:50.186
THAT THEY CAN REPLACE THAT. I

02:48:50.253 --> 02:48:52.655
THINK THEY'RE MAINLY INSURING

02:48:52.722 --> 02:48:54.157
AGAINST PEOPLE TRIPPING ON A

02:48:54.224 --> 02:48:55.692
CORD, TRIPPING ON CORDS AND THAT

02:48:55.758 --> 02:48:58.995
KIND OF THING. I MEAN, SO IT'S A

02:48:59.062 --> 02:48:59.662
LIABILITY. CERTAINLY. LOOK, IT'S

02:48:59.729 --> 02:49:01.865
ONE OF A SET OF ASSETS THAT ARE

02:49:01.931 --> 02:49:06.002
IN A BUILDING. YOU KNOW, I.

02:49:06.069 --> 02:49:08.738
GOSH, I HAVEN'T IT HASN'T COME

02:49:08.805 --> 02:49:11.140
UP THAT THIS IS A, THAT THE COST

02:49:11.207 --> 02:49:11.875
DRIVERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

02:49:11.941 --> 02:49:12.909
WHOLE BUILDING BURNING DOWN. AND

02:49:12.976 --> 02:49:14.777
THEN IT ADDS AN ADDITIONAL COST

02:49:14.844 --> 02:49:16.746
ASSOCIATED WITH THE, WITH, WITH

02:49:16.813 --> 02:49:19.682
THE DESTRUCTION OF THAT UNIT.

02:49:19.749 --> 02:49:21.651
IT'S BEEN MORE ON A TRIP AND

02:49:21.718 --> 02:49:24.420
FALL TYPE CONCERNS. BUT IS THAT

02:49:24.487 --> 02:49:26.022
CLEAR IN YOUR IN YOUR BILL THAT

02:49:26.089 --> 02:49:29.058
IT'S NOT GOING TO AFFECT THAT

02:49:29.125 --> 02:49:32.695
LIKE REPLACEMENT VALUE OR

02:49:32.762 --> 02:49:33.196
REPLACEMENT OF WHATEVER

02:49:33.263 --> 02:49:36.232
TECHNOLOGY IS IN THERE. YOU

02:49:36.299 --> 02:49:38.001
KNOW, I MEAN, LOOK, IF THAT'S

02:49:38.067 --> 02:49:39.802
THE CONCERN, I THINK WE COULD

02:49:39.869 --> 02:49:40.970
PUT IN SOME LANGUAGE ABOUT

02:49:41.037 --> 02:49:42.071
REPLACEMENT VALUE BECAUSE AT THE

02:49:42.138 --> 02:49:44.607
END OF THE DAY, THAT'S SUCH AN

02:49:44.674 --> 02:49:46.342
UNLIKELY SCENARIO. I MEAN, YOU

02:49:46.409 --> 02:49:48.511
KNOW, NOT IN MY DISTRICT. WELL,

02:49:48.578 --> 02:49:49.579
SADLY, LOOK, FROM MY

02:49:49.646 --> 02:49:50.613
PERSPECTIVE, I'M JUST TRYING TO

02:49:50.680 --> 02:49:52.148
MAKE IT EASIER FOR FOLKS TO FEEL

02:49:52.215 --> 02:49:54.684
GOOD ABOUT ADOPTING EVS, LIVING

02:49:54.751 --> 02:50:00.757
IN HOAS. SO. IF THERE'S A WAY WE

02:50:00.823 --> 02:50:02.926
CAN, WE CAN WE CAN WRITE THE

02:50:02.992 --> 02:50:04.360
LANGUAGE SO THAT IT WOULD ONLY

02:50:04.427 --> 02:50:08.665
BE FOR. FOR, YOU KNOW, THE KINDS

02:50:08.731 --> 02:50:10.033
OF CONCERNS THAT HAVE COME UP IN

02:50:10.099 --> 02:50:11.100
OUR PREVIOUS DISCUSSIONS, TRIP

02:50:11.167 --> 02:50:13.069
AND FALL SITUATIONS. I'M HAPPY

02:50:13.136 --> 02:50:14.837
TO DO THAT. I WOULD LOVE TO WORK

02:50:14.904 --> 02:50:16.906
WITH YOU ON THAT. I, I AM VERY

02:50:16.973 --> 02:50:18.007
CONCERNED. I THINK THIS IS A

02:50:18.074 --> 02:50:19.943
PERSONAL CHOICE YOU MAKE TO MAKE

02:50:20.009 --> 02:50:21.311
THAT PURCHASE. I HAVE A PERSONAL

02:50:21.377 --> 02:50:23.346
CHOICE THAT WE RUN A PUMPKIN

02:50:23.413 --> 02:50:24.314
PATCH. WE BUY ADDITIONAL

02:50:24.380 --> 02:50:25.281
POLICIES FOR THAT. THAT'S A

02:50:25.348 --> 02:50:28.318
PERSONAL CHOICE. SO I WON'T BE

02:50:28.384 --> 02:50:29.619
ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY.

02:50:29.686 --> 02:50:31.621
BUT THANK YOU, CHAIRMAN GIBSON,

02:50:31.688 --> 02:50:34.090
JUST REAL QUICK. I THINK I'VE

02:50:34.157 --> 02:50:35.792
MOVED THE BILL EARLIER, AND I

02:50:35.858 --> 02:50:37.260
THINK THAT I HAVE CONFIDENCE

02:50:37.327 --> 02:50:39.195
ENOUGH IN THE SENATOR AND THE

02:50:39.262 --> 02:50:41.464
AUTHOR OF THE INTENT OF THE BILL,

02:50:41.531 --> 02:50:42.799
THAT HE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK

02:50:42.865 --> 02:50:46.569
WITH THE OPPOSITION TO FROM

02:50:46.636 --> 02:50:48.538
MOVING THE BILL OUT OF

02:50:48.605 --> 02:50:50.106
COMMITTEE. I BELIEVE THERE'S

02:50:50.173 --> 02:50:52.175
ENOUGH DIALOG THAT HAVE TAKEN

02:50:52.241 --> 02:50:53.576
PLACE. HE HAS HEARD THE

02:50:53.643 --> 02:50:55.345
CONCERNS, AND I HAVE CONFIDENCE

02:50:55.411 --> 02:50:57.714
ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT WHEN THIS

02:50:57.780 --> 02:50:59.248
BILL, I THINK THIS BILL WILL

02:50:59.315 --> 02:51:00.583
PROBABLY FROM HERE GO TO

02:51:00.650 --> 02:51:02.986
APPROPRIATION TO THE FLOOR.

02:51:03.052 --> 02:51:06.089
OKAY. WE'LL SEE IT AGAIN. AND I

02:51:06.155 --> 02:51:07.690
BELIEVE THAT HE WILL AGAIN

02:51:07.757 --> 02:51:09.926
CONTINUE TO HAVE DIALOG TO MEET

02:51:09.993 --> 02:51:13.096
THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION.

02:51:13.162 --> 02:51:15.365
I THINK HIS WORK HERE HAS

02:51:15.431 --> 02:51:17.467
CERTAINLY SHOWN THAT. AND I

02:51:17.533 --> 02:51:19.502
BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE OF THE

02:51:19.569 --> 02:51:20.637
WITNESS WHO'S BROUGHT THIS,

02:51:20.703 --> 02:51:22.939
BECAUSE HE HAS CERTAINLY

02:51:23.006 --> 02:51:24.073
DEMONSTRATED THERE IS CERTAINLY

02:51:24.140 --> 02:51:26.142
AN ISSUE THAT I BELIEVE THAT IF

02:51:26.209 --> 02:51:28.611
HE'S HAVING AN ISSUE THAT OTHER

02:51:28.678 --> 02:51:29.245
PEOPLE WAS HAVING AN ISSUE, I

02:51:29.312 --> 02:51:32.615
BELIEVE THAT REGARDLESS, THERE

02:51:32.682 --> 02:51:34.584
WILL BE SOME COST ASSOCIATED,

02:51:34.651 --> 02:51:37.687
WHETHER IT'S THE HOA OR THE

02:51:37.754 --> 02:51:39.656
HOMEOWNER'S ASSOCIATION WILL

02:51:39.722 --> 02:51:42.091
OCCUR THIS MAY IT STILL SEEMS

02:51:42.158 --> 02:51:43.993
LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE A LIMITED

02:51:44.060 --> 02:51:45.662
BURDEN ON SOMEONE, AND I

02:51:45.728 --> 02:51:47.130
HOPEFULLY THAT THROUGH IT ALL,

02:51:47.196 --> 02:51:49.032
IT WILL WORK OUT THROUGH THE

02:51:49.098 --> 02:51:51.701
PROCESS. SO I JUST WANTED TO

02:51:51.768 --> 02:51:53.803
MAKE MENTION OF THAT. THAT GOES

02:51:53.870 --> 02:51:56.072
TO THE AUTHOR OF THE OF THE

02:51:56.139 --> 02:51:59.375
BILL, ASSEMBLYWOMAN CROW, THANK

02:51:59.442 --> 02:52:01.611
YOU SO MUCH, MADAM CHAIR. I WILL

02:52:01.678 --> 02:52:02.812
KEEP THIS QUICK. I AM PREPARED

02:52:02.879 --> 02:52:04.714
TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL TODAY, BUT

02:52:04.781 --> 02:52:06.049
I SHARE MY COLLEAGUES CONCERNS

02:52:06.115 --> 02:52:07.350
ABOUT IT. I'M ESPECIALLY

02:52:07.417 --> 02:52:08.251
CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT THAT

02:52:08.317 --> 02:52:09.652
THIS WILL HAVE ON HOMEOWNERS,

02:52:09.719 --> 02:52:11.521
AND IT REMAINS UNCLEAR TO ME HOW

02:52:11.587 --> 02:52:13.289
THE COSTS WILL BE SHARED AND WHO

02:52:13.356 --> 02:52:14.724
WILL END UP HAVING THE BURDEN

02:52:14.791 --> 02:52:16.192
AND WHAT THAT BURDEN LOOKS LIKE.

02:52:16.259 --> 02:52:19.028
SO I RESERVE TO NOT VOTE FOR IT

02:52:19.095 --> 02:52:21.097
ON THE FLOOR, JUST BASED ON

02:52:21.164 --> 02:52:22.865
FURTHER RESEARCH THAT I DO, AND

02:52:22.932 --> 02:52:24.300
HOPEFULLY FURTHER DIALOG THAT WE

02:52:24.367 --> 02:52:26.035
HAVE AND POTENTIAL AMENDMENTS

02:52:26.102 --> 02:52:27.303
LIKE THOSE THAT MY COLLEAGUES

02:52:27.370 --> 02:52:29.105
HERE HAVE DISCUSSED. BUT THANK

02:52:29.172 --> 02:52:31.207
YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR WORK ON IT,

02:52:31.274 --> 02:52:32.075
SENATOR, I APPRECIATE IT. THANK

02:52:32.141 --> 02:52:33.876
YOU. THANK YOU. AND WOULD YOU

02:52:33.943 --> 02:52:36.546
MIND IF OUR WITNESS WERE JUST TO

02:52:36.612 --> 02:52:37.180
ANSWER ONE ISSUE RELATED TO MR.

02:52:37.246 --> 02:52:39.449
CHADWICK'S CONCERNS? THANK YOU.

02:52:39.515 --> 02:52:40.950
SO WITH RESPECT TO THE CONCERN

02:52:41.017 --> 02:52:43.519
ABOUT REPLACEMENT COST, IF THIS

02:52:43.586 --> 02:52:46.723
BILL PASSES, I'M STILL REQUIRED

02:52:46.789 --> 02:52:49.325
TO MAINTAIN MY OWN POLICY, WHICH

02:52:49.392 --> 02:52:51.461
I WOULD BRING A CLAIM AGAINST IF

02:52:51.527 --> 02:52:54.030
THERE WERE A FIRE THAT RESULTED

02:52:54.097 --> 02:52:55.631
IN THE DESTRUCTION OF THAT

02:52:55.698 --> 02:52:59.635
CHARGER. SO IT'S STILL COVERED

02:52:59.702 --> 02:53:01.137
AND IT'S ULTIMATELY MY PROPERTY.

02:53:01.204 --> 02:53:02.772
SO EVEN IF I DIDN'T HAVE A

02:53:02.839 --> 02:53:03.773
POLICY WHICH WOULD STILL LEGALLY

02:53:03.840 --> 02:53:05.742
BE REQUIRED UNDER THE LAW, I

02:53:05.808 --> 02:53:07.176
WOULD HAVE TO. I MEAN, IT WOULD

02:53:07.243 --> 02:53:09.746
BE MY EXPECTATION TO REPLACE IT

02:53:09.812 --> 02:53:11.581
BECAUSE IT'S MY PROPERTY, RIGHT?

02:53:11.647 --> 02:53:12.982
YEAH. SO WE COULD WE COULD

02:53:13.049 --> 02:53:15.251
EXPLICITLY WRITE INTO WHATEVER

02:53:15.318 --> 02:53:17.787
INSURED REQUIREMENTS FOR THE HOA

02:53:17.854 --> 02:53:19.422
THAT THERE WOULDN'T BE A

02:53:19.489 --> 02:53:21.290
REPLACEMENT RESPONSIBILITY.

02:53:21.357 --> 02:53:23.059
YEAH. TO LOWER THE COST. LOWER

02:53:23.126 --> 02:53:26.763
THE LIABILITY. I MEAN THAT WOULD

02:53:26.829 --> 02:53:29.332
BE HELPFUL. RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.

02:53:29.398 --> 02:53:30.600
YOU THINK IT WOULDN'T BE LIKE

02:53:30.666 --> 02:53:34.971
THAT? OKAY. WELL, SENATOR,

02:53:35.037 --> 02:53:37.106
BEFORE YOU CLOSE, THANK YOU. I

02:53:37.173 --> 02:53:38.174
APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS AND

02:53:38.241 --> 02:53:40.443
COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES. AND

02:53:40.510 --> 02:53:42.211
I JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO PLEASE

02:53:42.278 --> 02:53:44.080
CONTINUE WORKING WITH MR. BROWN

02:53:44.147 --> 02:53:45.748
AND THE OPPOSITION THROUGH THIS,

02:53:45.815 --> 02:53:47.583
BECAUSE I THINK EVERYBODY ON

02:53:47.650 --> 02:53:50.386
THIS DAIS AND I KNOW YOU IN THIS

02:53:50.453 --> 02:53:51.854
SPACE, THE LAST THING WE WANT TO

02:53:51.921 --> 02:53:54.824
SEE IS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES

02:53:54.891 --> 02:53:57.727
TO HOA MEMBERS. AND WE'VE SEEN

02:53:57.794 --> 02:53:59.796
THEIR RATES SKYROCKET OVER THE

02:53:59.862 --> 02:54:01.430
LAST FEW YEARS. AND I KNOW

02:54:01.497 --> 02:54:02.331
THAT'S NOT YOUR INTENT. YOU'RE

02:54:02.398 --> 02:54:06.769
TRYING TO HELP WITH THE EV

02:54:06.836 --> 02:54:08.838
ISSUE. AND SO I JUST ENCOURAGE

02:54:08.905 --> 02:54:10.640
YOU TO PLEASE KEEP WORKING WITH

02:54:10.706 --> 02:54:12.108
THE OPPOSITION AS THIS MOVES

02:54:12.175 --> 02:54:13.843
FORWARD. OKAY. WOULD YOU LIKE TO

02:54:13.910 --> 02:54:15.278
CLOSE? YEAH. I MEAN, JUST

02:54:15.344 --> 02:54:17.413
REMEMBER THESE ARE THESE ARE

02:54:17.480 --> 02:54:20.917
SITUATIONS WHERE FOLKS ARE ARE

02:54:20.983 --> 02:54:22.785
IN SHARED PARKING. THAT'S WHY WE

02:54:22.852 --> 02:54:24.420
HAVE TO BE HERE IN THIS

02:54:24.487 --> 02:54:24.954
CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW AS

02:54:25.021 --> 02:54:26.823
OPPOSED TO INDIVIDUALIZED

02:54:26.889 --> 02:54:28.891
GARAGES IN THOSE PLACES WHERE

02:54:28.958 --> 02:54:31.127
INDIVIDUALS, GARAGES, IT'S ALL

02:54:31.194 --> 02:54:32.995
CLEARLY IN THE HANDS OF THE, OF

02:54:33.062 --> 02:54:34.564
THE, OF THE RESIDENT. AND SO

02:54:34.630 --> 02:54:36.599
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO COME UP

02:54:36.666 --> 02:54:38.568
WITH A, I MEAN, IT'S A CLUNKY

02:54:38.634 --> 02:54:40.169
IT'S A CLUNKY SITUATION IN TERMS

ABLE TO GET A LITTLE CLOSER. I

02:54:56.152 --> 02:54:57.920
THINK YOUR SUGGESTION IS NOT A

02:54:57.987 --> 02:54:59.755
BAD ONE IN TERMS OF WHATEVER WE

02:54:59.822 --> 02:55:02.024
CAN DO TO REDUCE THE COST, THE

02:55:02.091 --> 02:55:03.226
POTENTIAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

02:55:03.292 --> 02:55:05.428

02:55:05.494 --> 02:55:06.829
MEAN, BECAUSE IN THE END OF THE

02:55:06.896 --> 02:55:08.898
DAY, ALL THIS IS ABOUT FOR ME IS

02:55:08.965 --> 02:55:10.967
