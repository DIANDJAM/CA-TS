QUALIFIED EMPLOYEE TRAINING

00:38:06.684 --> 00:38:09.186
RECORDS ARE COMPREHENSIVE OF ALL

00:38:09.253 --> 00:38:10.621
TRAINING. USEFUL IN

00:38:10.688 --> 00:38:12.390
DEMONSTRATING SKILLS AND

00:38:12.456 --> 00:38:13.991
ACCESSIBLE FOR AN EMPLOYEE

00:38:14.058 --> 00:38:15.026
SEARCH WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING FOR

00:38:15.092 --> 00:38:17.395
A NEW JOB. WHEN WORKERS ARE LAID

00:38:17.461 --> 00:38:18.929
OFF, THEY MUST RESPOND QUICKLY

00:38:18.996 --> 00:38:21.065
AND FIND NEW EMPLOYMENT

00:38:21.132 --> 00:38:23.134
OPPORTUNITIES. IN SOME CASES,

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.902
TRAINING RECORDS ARE BEING

00:38:24.969 --> 00:38:27.238
WITHHELD FROM EMPLOYEES UNTIL

00:38:27.304 --> 00:38:29.807
THE END OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT. FOR

00:38:29.874 --> 00:38:31.809
EXAMPLE, THE PHILLIPS 66

00:38:31.876 --> 00:38:33.010
REFINERY NOTIFIED THEIR

00:38:33.077 --> 00:38:34.145
EMPLOYEES THAT THEY WOULD BE

00:38:34.211 --> 00:38:36.847
LAID OFF IN DECEMBER OF 2025.

00:38:36.914 --> 00:38:38.616
HOWEVER, THEIR TRAINING AND

00:38:38.683 --> 00:38:40.117
EDUCATION RECORDS ARE BEING

00:38:40.184 --> 00:38:42.787
WITHHELD FROM THEM UNTIL AUGUST

00:38:42.853 --> 00:38:45.056
2025. THIS IS UNFAIR. WORKERS

00:38:45.122 --> 00:38:47.324
NEED TO PREPARE, VERIFY THEIR

00:38:47.391 --> 00:38:49.126
TRAINING CERTIFICATES AND SEARCH

00:38:49.193 --> 00:38:50.795

00:38:50.861 --> 00:38:53.397
IN ADVANCE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE,

00:38:53.464 --> 00:38:55.633
AND NOT UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE.

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:57.702
THEY HAVE FAMILIES TO FEED AND

00:38:57.768 --> 00:38:59.970
COMMUNITIES TO CARE FOR HOUSING.

00:39:00.037 --> 00:39:02.073
THEY ARE EXPERTS IN THEIR

00:39:02.139 --> 00:39:03.240
SPECIALTIES. THEY JUST NEED TO

00:39:03.307 --> 00:39:05.009
PROVE THEIR TRAINING

00:39:05.076 --> 00:39:06.410
CERTIFICATIONS TO FUTURE AND

00:39:06.477 --> 00:39:08.546
POTENTIAL EMPLOYERS AND PREPARE

00:39:08.612 --> 00:39:11.315
FOR THEIR FOR THOSE CAREERS,

00:39:11.382 --> 00:39:13.317
ESPECIALLY AS JOB SECTORS

00:39:13.384 --> 00:39:15.052
TRANSITION TO MEET STATE CLIMATE

00:39:15.119 --> 00:39:16.520
GOALS. BUT HOW WILL THEY FIND A

00:39:16.587 --> 00:39:18.355
JOB IF THEY CANNOT GET ACCESS TO

00:39:18.422 --> 00:39:20.357
THEIR RECORDS? IT'S LIKE IF

00:39:20.424 --> 00:39:21.926
SOMEBODY WAS WITHHOLDING YOUR

00:39:21.992 --> 00:39:23.627
BACHELOR'S DEGREE AND THEN YOU

00:39:23.694 --> 00:39:25.196
NEEDED FOR JOB OPPORTUNITY, BUT

00:39:25.262 --> 00:39:26.664
YOU CAN'T PROVE THAT YOU HAVE

00:39:26.731 --> 00:39:28.632
THE DEGREE BECAUSE IT IS BEING

00:39:28.699 --> 00:39:31.168
WITHHELD FROM YOU. ANOTHER

00:39:31.235 --> 00:39:34.238
EXAMPLE HAPPENED IN 2020 WITH

00:39:34.305 --> 00:39:36.273

CERTIFICATIONS, WHICH DESCRIBE

00:40:00.531 --> 00:40:02.399
THEIR FORMAL SKILLS. EMPLOYERS

00:40:02.466 --> 00:40:04.001
ARE IN CONTROL. EMPLOYEES HAVE

00:40:04.068 --> 00:40:05.736
NO OTHER WAY TO REQUIRE THEIR

00:40:05.803 --> 00:40:08.005
EMPLOYERS TO PROVIDE THEM WITH

00:40:08.072 --> 00:40:09.406
THEIR EDUCATION OR TRAINING

00:40:09.473 --> 00:40:10.775
CERTIFICATE CERTIFICATIONS.

00:40:10.841 --> 00:40:12.576

00:40:12.643 --> 00:40:14.178
HEARING FROM OUR WITNESS, REGINA

00:40:14.245 --> 00:40:16.614
KAY FLEMING, UNITED STEELWORKERS

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:19.116

00:40:19.183 --> 00:40:23.087
AND CATHERINE HOUSTON, WITH US W

00:40:23.154 --> 00:40:24.555
AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY

00:40:24.622 --> 00:40:28.159
TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. HELLO. HI,

00:40:28.225 --> 00:40:30.060
I'M REGINA FLEMING AND I'VE BEEN

00:40:30.127 --> 00:40:32.830
WORKING FOR PHILLIPS 66 LA FOR

00:40:32.897 --> 00:40:35.699
17 YEARS. I WAS THERE WHEN THEY

00:40:35.766 --> 00:40:37.034
ANNOUNCED THE CLOSURE OF OUR

00:40:37.101 --> 00:40:38.702
REFINERY AFTER THAT. SHORTLY

00:40:38.769 --> 00:40:40.938
AFTER THAT, WE HAD TO GO INTO

00:40:41.005 --> 00:40:41.539
BARGAIN EFFECTS. DURING OUR

00:40:41.605 --> 00:40:43.974
BARGAIN EFFECTS, THEY BASICALLY

00:40:44.041 --> 00:40:46.544
HELD OUR TRAINING RECORDS OVER

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:48.512
OUR HEADS AND WE HAD TO BARGAIN

00:40:48.579 --> 00:40:51.148
FOR THAT. SINCE THAT TIME, SINCE

00:40:51.215 --> 00:40:55.252
THAT TIME, WE HAVE ACCESS TO

00:40:55.319 --> 00:40:58.489
THEM 90 DAYS BEFORE 90 DAYS FOR

00:40:58.556 --> 00:41:02.359
ONLY 90 DAYS. THAT IS GOING TO

00:41:02.426 --> 00:41:04.528
EXPIRE DECEMBER 1ST. WE'RE NOT

00:41:04.595 --> 00:41:06.063
GOING TO HAVE OUR LAYOFF NOTICES

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:07.865
UNTIL SEPTEMBER. AND THAT'S WHEN

00:41:07.932 --> 00:41:09.867
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF WE'RE

00:41:09.934 --> 00:41:10.901
GOING TO GET LAID OFF FOR

00:41:10.968 --> 00:41:12.403
DECEMBER 1ST. SO THE BIGGEST

00:41:12.469 --> 00:41:14.438
PROBLEM HERE IS THAT THEY

00:41:14.505 --> 00:41:16.373
DISMANTLED THE ENTIRE TRAINING

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:17.842
DEPARTMENT. THEY SENT ALL OF THE

00:41:17.908 --> 00:41:19.944
TRAINERS THAT HAS ACCESS TO ALL

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:21.378
OF OUR WORK THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED

00:41:21.445 --> 00:41:22.947
TO BE PUTTING PACKAGES TOGETHER

00:41:23.013 --> 00:41:24.682
FOR US. BACK TO THE UNITS. SO

00:41:24.748 --> 00:41:26.483
THERE'S NO ONE THERE RIGHT NOW

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:28.752
THAT IS GOING TO GIVE US OUR

00:41:28.819 --> 00:41:29.553
TRAINING RECORDS. WE'RE AFRAID

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:31.522
THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE JUST LIKE

00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:33.090
MARATHON MARTINEZ, AND THEY'RE

00:41:33.157 --> 00:41:34.758
GOING TO TELL US, NO, WE JUST

00:41:34.825 --> 00:41:36.727
CAN'T GET ANYTHING. THIS BILL IS

00:41:36.794 --> 00:41:38.762
SO IMPORTANT FOR US RIGHT NOW

00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:40.631
BECAUSE WITH ME BEING THERE FOR

00:41:40.698 --> 00:41:42.600
17 YEARS, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN THERE

00:41:42.666 --> 00:41:43.500
FOR THREE YEARS. THEY JUST

00:41:43.567 --> 00:41:45.469
THOUGHT THEY HAD A GREAT CAREER

00:41:45.536 --> 00:41:48.138
TO GO TO PEOPLE THERE FOR 40

00:41:48.205 --> 00:41:49.607
YEARS. WE JUST REALLY NEED

00:41:49.673 --> 00:41:50.941
ACCESS TO OUR TRAINING RECORDS

00:41:51.008 --> 00:41:52.776
BECAUSE AFTER THAT WE JUST START

00:41:52.843 --> 00:41:55.512
ALL OVER AGAIN. WE WILL WE WILL

00:41:55.579 --> 00:41:58.182
HAVE TO START ALL OVER AGAIN.

00:41:58.249 --> 00:41:59.450
THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME. THANK

00:41:59.516 --> 00:42:09.093
YOU. THANK YOU. AND. DO WE HAVE

00:42:09.159 --> 00:42:20.871
ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT?

00:42:20.938 --> 00:42:22.273
GOOD MORNING. AFTERNOON. I

00:42:22.339 --> 00:42:24.975
SHOULD SAY SO. I JUST WANTED TO

00:42:25.042 --> 00:42:26.610
SAY, AS REGINA HAD MENTIONED,

00:42:26.677 --> 00:42:28.112
THAT THIS BILL IS REALLY KEY FOR

00:42:28.178 --> 00:42:29.613
US BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO MENTION

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.448
THAT YOU HAVE SPENT YOUR ENTIRE

00:42:31.515 --> 00:42:33.050
CAREER WORKING IN A HIGHLY

00:42:33.117 --> 00:42:35.352
VOLATILE, HIGH HAZARD WORK

00:42:35.419 --> 00:42:37.655
ENVIRONMENT. AND WHEN IT IS TIME

00:42:37.721 --> 00:42:39.223
THAT YOU ARE LAID OFF AND YOU

00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:40.891
ASK YOUR EMPLOYER FOR YOUR

00:42:40.958 --> 00:42:43.594
RECORDS TO PROVE ALL OF THE

00:42:43.661 --> 00:42:44.261
TRAINING, CERTIFICATION IN THIS

00:42:44.328 --> 00:42:47.331
HIGHLY VOLATILE, HIGH HAZARD

00:42:47.398 --> 00:42:49.333
ARENA, AND YOU ARE FLAT OUT TOLD

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:52.336
NO. AND SO WHEN YOU ARE TALKING

00:42:52.403 --> 00:42:54.939
ABOUT THE MARKETABILITY OF A

00:42:55.005 --> 00:42:56.874
PERSON, THEIR THEIR VALUE, SO

00:42:56.941 --> 00:42:58.575
MUCH OF OUR VALUE IS ATTACHED TO

00:42:58.642 --> 00:43:00.978
WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE DO AS OUR

00:43:01.045 --> 00:43:02.546
JOBS. SO IF YOU CAN'T

00:43:02.613 --> 00:43:04.281
EFFECTIVELY GO TO YOUR NEXT

00:43:04.348 --> 00:43:05.182
EMPLOYER AND MAKE THAT CASE FOR

00:43:05.249 --> 00:43:06.850
WHAT YOUR JOB IS BECAUSE THE

00:43:06.917 --> 00:43:07.952
EMPLOYER FLAT OUT TELLS YOU NO,

00:43:08.018 --> 00:43:10.454
OR IN THIS CASE, HANGS IT OVER

00:43:10.521 --> 00:43:11.455
YOUR HEAD AS A BARGAINING CHIP.

00:43:11.522 --> 00:43:13.190
THAT IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE.

00:43:13.257 --> 00:43:15.392
IT HONESTLY, I HAVE TO SAY IT'S

00:43:15.459 --> 00:43:16.994
TO ME IT'S RIDICULOUS TO HAVE TO

00:43:17.061 --> 00:43:19.363
RUN A BILL TO SAY WE HAVE ACCESS

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:20.831
TO OUR RECORDS, THAT WE HAVE

00:43:20.898 --> 00:43:22.566

EXEMPTION, IT EXPIRED LAST YEAR.

00:47:35.819 --> 00:47:38.555
MANY EMPLOYERS HAVE CONTINUED TO

MISCLASSIFY DRIVERS, DEPRIVING

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:42.859

COMPENSATION AND THE RIGHT TO

00:47:49.032 --> 00:47:51.802
CLEAR SOLUTION BY INCENTIVIZING

00:47:51.868 --> 00:47:54.071

SYSTEM. THIS SYSTEM ENSURES THAT

00:48:06.984 --> 00:48:09.253
DRIVERS ARE PAID TWO CHECKS, ONE

00:48:09.319 --> 00:48:10.954
FOR THEIR LABOR AND ONE FOR THE

00:48:11.021 --> 00:48:13.523
USE OF THEIR EQUIPMENT. THIS

00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:15.292
GUARANTEES THEY'RE COMPENSATED

00:48:15.359 --> 00:48:17.794
FAIRLY FOR BOTH THEIR TIME AND

00:48:25.068 --> 00:48:26.803
BENEFITING BOTH EMPLOYERS AND

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:29.373
THE WORKERS AND CREATING A LEVEL

00:48:29.439 --> 00:48:32.009

00:48:52.162 --> 00:48:53.830
THIS BILL IS THE PROVERBIAL

00:48:57.868 --> 00:49:00.671
THE END OF 2024 FOR CONSTRUCTION

00:49:00.737 --> 00:49:02.105
TRUCKING, AND WE'RE DOING OUR

00:49:02.172 --> 00:49:04.241
BEST TO BRING EMPLOYERS INTO

00:49:04.308 --> 00:49:06.376
COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW IN A WAY

00:49:06.443 --> 00:49:07.444
THAT BENEFITS THEM, BUT ALSO

00:49:07.511 --> 00:49:10.347
BENEFITS THE EMPLOYEE AS WELL.

00:49:10.414 --> 00:49:11.848
AND THE WAY WE'RE DOING THAT IS

00:49:11.915 --> 00:49:13.950
SAYING, IF YOU IMPLEMENT THIS

00:49:14.017 --> 00:49:15.452
HIGH ROAD JOBS MODEL, THE TWO

00:49:15.519 --> 00:49:17.921

CAN GET IMMUNIZED FOR LIABILITY

00:49:22.359 --> 00:49:23.360
FOR MISCLASSIFICATION. THIS IS A

00:49:23.427 --> 00:49:24.895
MODEL THAT'S BEEN USED ACROSS

00:49:24.961 --> 00:49:26.763
THE UNITED STATES. AND IT'S

00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:28.332
WORKED REALLY WELL TO TRANSITION

00:49:28.398 --> 00:49:30.467

00:49:30.534 --> 00:49:31.768
CONTRACTORS, INTO EMPLOYEES

00:49:31.835 --> 00:49:33.804
BECAUSE IT DOES COMPENSATE THEM

00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:35.939
FAIRLY FOR THEIR INVESTMENT IN A

00:49:36.006 --> 00:49:37.607
VEHICLE, A TRUCK, AND MAKE SURE

00:49:37.674 --> 00:49:39.476
THAT THEY'RE GETTING ONE, ONE

00:49:39.543 --> 00:49:41.178
CHECK FOR THEIR WAGES AND

00:49:41.244 --> 00:49:42.145
BENEFITS AND ANOTHER CHECK FOR

00:49:42.212 --> 00:49:43.613
THE FAIR USE OF THEIR VEHICLE.

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:46.350
AND SO WE THINK IT'S ABOUT HIGH

00:49:46.416 --> 00:49:48.485
TIME THAT WE BRING WORKERS INTO

00:49:48.552 --> 00:49:50.287

WOULD CODIFY THE CALIFORNIA

00:53:00.377 --> 00:53:02.546
WORKPLACE OUTREACH PROGRAM, A

00:53:02.612 --> 00:53:04.247
VITAL EFFORT TO ENSURE WORKERS

00:53:04.314 --> 00:53:06.149
ACROSS OUR STATE ARE EDUCATED ON

00:53:06.216 --> 00:53:08.051
THEIR RIGHTS AND EMPOWERED TO

00:53:08.118 --> 00:53:11.621
ASSERT THEM. SB 578 FORMALLY

00:53:11.688 --> 00:53:13.690
ESTABLISHES THE SWAP IN THE

00:53:13.757 --> 00:53:15.926
LABOR CODE. BUILDING ON THE

00:53:15.992 --> 00:53:17.961
SUCCESS OF A PANDEMIC ERA MODEL

00:53:18.028 --> 00:53:20.230
THAT EMPOWERED TRUSTED COMMUNITY

00:53:20.297 --> 00:53:21.231
ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE

00:53:21.298 --> 00:53:23.099
WORKERS, ESPECIALLY THOSE IN LOW

00:53:23.166 --> 00:53:25.635
WAGE AND HIGH VIOLATION

00:53:25.702 --> 00:53:27.871
INDUSTRIES, WITH ACCURATE,

00:53:27.938 --> 00:53:29.506
MULTILINGUAL WORKPLACE RIGHTS

00:53:29.573 --> 00:53:31.408
INFORMATION. THE NEED FOR

00:53:31.474 --> 00:53:33.076
WORKPLACE RIGHTS EDUCATION GOES

00:53:33.143 --> 00:53:35.345
FAR BEYOND COVID, AND WE KNOW

00:53:35.412 --> 00:53:36.947
THIS BECAUSE SO MANY WORKERS ARE

00:53:37.013 --> 00:53:39.316
IN THOSE HIGHLY UNREGULATED, LOW

00:53:39.382 --> 00:53:41.451
WAGE INDUSTRIES. EVERY YEAR,

00:53:41.518 --> 00:53:44.387
CALIFORNIA WORKERS LOSE NEARLY

00:53:44.454 --> 00:53:46.456
$2 BILLION TO MINIMUM WAGE

00:53:46.523 --> 00:53:47.924
VIOLATIONS. AND ACCORDING TO THE

00:53:47.991 --> 00:53:49.659
NATIONAL EMPLOYMENT LAW PROJECT,

00:53:49.726 --> 00:53:51.461
38% OF CALIFORNIA WORKERS

00:53:51.528 --> 00:53:53.163
EXPERIENCE WORKPLACE VIOLATIONS

00:53:53.229 --> 00:53:55.765
FROM WAGE THEFT, UNSAFE WORKING

00:53:55.832 --> 00:53:58.368
CONDITIONS, RETALIATION AND

00:53:58.435 --> 00:54:00.470
DISCRIMINATION. TOO OFTEN, THE

00:54:00.537 --> 00:54:02.238
WORKERS MOST VULNERABLE TO ABUSE

00:54:02.305 --> 00:54:03.907
ARE THE LEAST LIKELY TO KNOW

00:54:03.974 --> 00:54:06.109
THEIR RIGHTS AND TO HAVE ACCESS

00:54:06.176 --> 00:54:07.310
TO THEM, LET ALONE TO ASSERT

00:54:07.377 --> 00:54:10.614
THEM. AND SB 578 ADDRESSES THAT

00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:13.516
GAP. WHAT BEGAN AS A COVID

00:54:13.583 --> 00:54:14.985
RESPONSE? WE KNOW, BUT IT IS A

00:54:15.051 --> 00:54:17.120
PROVEN RULE. AND IN THE LAST 14

00:54:17.187 --> 00:54:20.724
MONTHS ALONE, THE PROGRAM RUN BY

00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:23.259
62 COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS IN

00:54:23.326 --> 00:54:24.628
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE,

00:54:24.694 --> 00:54:27.097
REACHED NEARLY 2 MILLION WORKERS

00:54:27.163 --> 00:54:30.467
ACROSS 38 COUNTIES, COVERING 96%

00:54:30.533 --> 00:54:33.970
OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION. THE

00:54:34.037 --> 00:54:36.172
STATE, AS A RESULT OF THAT,

00:54:36.239 --> 00:54:39.109
REMITTED TO THE PROGRAM $25

00:54:39.175 --> 00:54:41.211
MILLION IN FUNDING. AND NOW IT'S

00:54:41.277 --> 00:54:42.579
TIME TO GIVE IT PERMANENT

00:54:42.646 --> 00:54:45.115
FOOTING IN LAW. OTHER OUTREACH

00:54:45.181 --> 00:54:46.249
PROGRAMS, SUCH AS THE DOMESTIC

00:54:46.316 --> 00:54:48.084
WORKER RIGHTS EDUCATION PROGRAM,

00:54:48.151 --> 00:54:49.786
THE GARMENT WORKER WAGE CLAIM

00:54:49.853 --> 00:54:51.955
PILOT PROGRAM, ARE CODIFIED IN

00:54:52.022 --> 00:54:55.091
LABOR CODE. SB 578 ENSURES THAT

00:54:55.158 --> 00:54:58.094
SWOP HAS THE SAME STABILITY AND

00:54:58.161 --> 00:54:59.963
ACCOUNTABILITY, AND WE WANT TO

00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:02.065
RECOGNIZE THE EFFECTIVE WAY THAT

00:55:02.132 --> 00:55:05.268
LABOR LAWS REQUIRE ARE REQUIRED

00:55:05.335 --> 00:55:07.671
TO INFORM WORKERS. AND THIS BILL

00:55:07.737 --> 00:55:10.340
DOES THAT WITH ME TODAY. TO

00:55:10.407 --> 00:55:12.108
TESTIFY IS PAMELA WITH UC

00:55:12.175 --> 00:55:14.044
BERKELEY LABOR CENTER AND ALEXIS

00:55:14.110 --> 00:55:17.113
WITH THE POMONA ECONOMIC

00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:22.185
OPPORTUNITY CENTER. EXCUSE ME,

00:55:22.252 --> 00:55:24.054
MADAM CHAIR, AND MEMBERS OF THE

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:25.221
COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS PAM. CAN

00:55:25.288 --> 00:55:26.890
YOU MOVE THE MICROPHONE A LITTLE

00:55:26.956 --> 00:55:28.858
CLOSER? THANK YOU. THERE YOU GO.

00:55:28.925 --> 00:55:30.427
IS THAT BETTER? YES. THANK YOU,

00:55:30.493 --> 00:55:31.761
MADAM CHAIR. AND MEMBERS OF THE

00:55:31.828 --> 00:55:34.030
COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS PAM EGAN,

00:55:34.097 --> 00:55:34.664
AND I'M WITH THE UC BERKELEY

00:55:34.731 --> 00:55:36.633
LABOR CENTER. MUCH OF OUR WORK

00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:38.835
FOCUSES ON THE POLICIES AND

00:55:38.902 --> 00:55:40.470
PRACTICES THAT ENSURE SAFE AND

00:55:40.537 --> 00:55:42.372
DIGNIFIED WORKPLACES FOR ALL

00:55:42.439 --> 00:55:44.140
WORKERS, ESPECIALLY IMMIGRANT,

00:55:44.207 --> 00:55:45.909
BLACK AND INDIGENOUS WORKERS AND

00:55:45.975 --> 00:55:49.913
WORKERS OF COLOR. WE'RE

00:55:49.979 --> 00:55:51.448
FORTUNATE THAT CALIFORNIA'S

00:55:51.514 --> 00:55:52.882
WORKPLACE PROTECTIONS ARE THE

00:55:52.949 --> 00:55:54.084
STRONGEST IN THE COUNTRY, BUT

00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:56.052
THEIR INTENDED IMPACT IS

00:55:56.119 --> 00:55:57.153
UNDERCUT WHEN WORKERS EITHER

00:55:57.220 --> 00:56:00.390
DON'T KNOW OR DON'T TRUST THE

00:56:00.457 --> 00:56:01.558
STANDARDS, RIGHTS AND MECHANISMS

00:56:01.624 --> 00:56:03.660
THAT PROTECT THEM. THE

00:56:03.727 --> 00:56:05.795
CALIFORNIA WORKPLACE OUTREACH

00:56:05.862 --> 00:56:07.597
PROGRAM PROVIDES THE

00:56:07.664 --> 00:56:08.698
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CAN ADDRESS

00:56:08.765 --> 00:56:11.267
THAT PROBLEM. MY COLLEAGUES AT

00:56:11.334 --> 00:56:13.336
THE UC BERKELEY POSSIBILITY LAB

00:56:13.403 --> 00:56:15.638
STUDIED SWAP'S IMPACT, AND THEIR

00:56:15.705 --> 00:56:17.140
STUDY CONFIRMS THAT WORKERS IN

00:56:17.207 --> 00:56:18.808
LOW WAGE INDUSTRIES WANT TO KNOW

00:56:18.875 --> 00:56:20.877
THEIR RIGHTS AT WORK. FOUR OUT

00:56:20.944 --> 00:56:22.245
OF FIVE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT

00:56:22.312 --> 00:56:24.347
GETTING SICK AT WORK, UNSAFE

00:56:24.414 --> 00:56:25.915
WORKING CONDITIONS, EMPLOYER

00:56:25.982 --> 00:56:27.417
RETALIATION FOR BRINGING UP

00:56:27.484 --> 00:56:28.818
ISSUES AND NOT GETTING TIME OFF

00:56:28.885 --> 00:56:30.987
TO CARE FOR OTHERS. BUT WORKERS

00:56:31.054 --> 00:56:32.822
IN LOW WAGE INDUSTRIES GENERALLY

00:56:32.889 --> 00:56:36.159
DON'T KNOW THEIR RIGHTS. BETWEEN

00:56:36.226 --> 00:56:37.560
32 AND 54% OF WORKERS SURVEYED

00:56:37.627 --> 00:56:39.362
STRUGGLED TO IDENTIFY

00:56:39.429 --> 00:56:41.030
VIOLATIONS. ON THE FLIP SIDE,

00:56:41.097 --> 00:56:42.532
THOUGH, WORKERS WHO HAD BEEN

00:56:42.599 --> 00:56:44.701
EDUCATED BY A TRUSTED MESSENGER

00:56:44.768 --> 00:56:46.102
ORGANIZATION THROUGH SWOP ARE

00:56:46.169 --> 00:56:47.971
MORE LIKELY TO BE AWARE OF FAIR

00:56:48.037 --> 00:56:50.406
PAYMENT LAWS, LEGAL PROTECTION,

00:56:50.473 --> 00:56:52.175
REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS

00:56:52.242 --> 00:56:54.043
AND THEIR RIGHT TO USE PAID SICK

00:56:54.110 --> 00:56:56.913
LEAVE. ANOTHER AREA OF CONCERN

00:56:56.980 --> 00:56:58.782
IS THAT TWO THIRDS OF WORKERS IN

00:56:58.848 --> 00:56:59.749
LOW WAGE INDUSTRIES ARE

00:56:59.816 --> 00:57:01.184
UNFAMILIAR WITH THE LABOR

00:57:01.251 --> 00:57:03.720
COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE, AND 80%

00:57:03.787 --> 00:57:05.989
DISTRUST GOVERNMENT. GENERALLY.

00:57:06.055 --> 00:57:07.323
WORKERS TRUST IS MUCH HIGHER,

00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:09.559
THOUGH, AND LOCAL COMMUNITY

00:57:09.626 --> 00:57:11.261
ORGANIZATIONS AND WORKERS WHO'VE

00:57:11.327 --> 00:57:12.962
CONNECTED WITH TRUSTED MESSENGER

00:57:13.029 --> 00:57:14.831
ORGANIZATIONS THROUGH SWOP ARE

00:57:14.898 --> 00:57:16.733
MORE LIKELY TO TAKE ACTION TO

00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:18.201
CONFRONT LABOR VIOLATIONS THAN

00:57:18.268 --> 00:57:19.569
WORKERS WHO'VE NEVER BEEN

00:57:19.636 --> 00:57:21.037
EDUCATED OR SUPPORTED BY A

00:57:21.104 --> 00:57:23.106
COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION. MY

00:57:23.173 --> 00:57:25.008
COLLEAGUES AND I AT UC BERKELEY,

00:57:25.074 --> 00:57:27.877
AT UCLA, AND AT UC MERCED LABOR

00:57:27.944 --> 00:57:29.312
CENTERS, WE WORK DIRECTLY WITH

00:57:29.379 --> 00:57:31.414
WITH DER TO ADMINISTER THE

00:57:31.481 --> 00:57:33.283
PROGRAM. NOW IN ITS FIFTH

00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:36.119
ITERATION, WE SEE FIRSTHAND THAT

00:57:36.186 --> 00:57:38.621
SWOP IS A SCALABLE AND COST

00:57:38.688 --> 00:57:42.025
EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION. THANKS

JUST WANT TO SAY THAT ONE OF THE

00:57:59.542 --> 00:58:00.877
BIGGEST MOTIVATORS TO MAKE

00:58:00.944 --> 00:58:03.947
CALIFORNIA A THRIVING PLACE FOR

00:58:04.013 --> 00:58:05.748
WORKERS IS NOT JUST THE DAY

MAKE OUR LIVES POSSIBLE. MOST OF

01:21:52.607 --> 01:21:54.376
THE JUDGMENTS GO UNPAID, AND

01:21:54.442 --> 01:21:55.810
THERE ARE FEW CONSEQUENCES FOR

01:21:55.877 --> 01:21:57.946
BAD EMPLOYERS. IN SANTA CLARA

01:21:58.013 --> 01:21:59.080
COUNTY, THE OFFICE OF LABOR

01:21:59.147 --> 01:22:01.182
STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT USES OUR

01:22:01.249 --> 01:22:02.183
PERMITTING POWERS, INCLUDING

PARTNERSHIP WITH STATE, LOCAL

01:22:10.659 --> 01:22:12.427
AGENCIES. OSC HAS RETURNED MORE

01:22:12.494 --> 01:22:15.330
THAN $500,000 IN UNPAID WAGES

01:22:15.397 --> 01:22:17.132
BACK TO WORKERS. WHILE THIS HAS

01:22:17.198 --> 01:22:19.067
BEEN A MODEL TO CLOSE JUDGMENTS

01:22:19.134 --> 01:22:20.568
AND GET WORKERS PAID, MUCH WORK

01:22:20.635 --> 01:22:22.771
REMAINS. BETWEEN 2010 AND 2024,

01:22:22.837 --> 01:22:23.972
THE CALIFORNIA LABOR

01:22:24.039 --> 01:22:25.273
COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE ISSUED

01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:26.641
WAGE AND HOUR JUDGMENTS

01:22:26.708 --> 01:22:28.243
AMOUNTING TO MORE THAN $35

01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:30.345
MILLION. IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY

01:22:30.412 --> 01:22:32.213
ALONE, SB 261 WILL HELP

01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:34.015
ENCOURAGE BUSINESSES TO SATISFY

01:22:34.082 --> 01:22:35.450
THEIR FINAL WAGE THEFT

01:22:35.517 --> 01:22:36.851
JUDGMENTS, WHICH IS CRITICAL TO

01:22:36.918 --> 01:22:38.553
HAVING A HEALTHY ECONOMY.

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:39.387
AGGRESSIVELY COMBATING WAGE

01:22:39.454 --> 01:22:40.722
THEFT IS GOOD NOT ONLY FOR

01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:42.324
WORKERS, BUT ALSO FOR LEGITIMATE

01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:44.125
BUSINESS OWNERS WHO ARE PAYING

01:22:44.192 --> 01:22:45.093
THEIR EMPLOYER'S EMPLOYEES

01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:47.295
PROPERLY AND ARE PUT AT A

01:22:47.362 --> 01:22:47.962
COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE TO THE

01:22:48.029 --> 01:22:49.397
BAD ACTORS COMMITTING WAGE THEFT

01:22:49.464 --> 01:22:51.266
AS A BUSINESS PRACTICE. THIS

01:22:51.333 --> 01:22:52.400
BILL WILL ALSO AUTHORIZE THE

01:22:52.467 --> 01:22:53.702
COURT TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL

01:22:53.768 --> 01:22:55.537
PENALTIES. PENALTIES AFTER SIX

01:22:55.603 --> 01:22:57.172
MONTHS OF PROLONGED NONPAYMENT,

01:22:57.238 --> 01:22:58.707
BUT IT WILL NOT COME AS A

01:22:58.773 --> 01:23:00.141
SURPRISE. I WANT TO NOTE THAT

01:23:00.208 --> 01:23:01.676
BUSINESSES ARE CONTACTED

01:23:01.743 --> 01:23:03.712
MULTIPLE TIMES, THEY UNDERGO

01:23:03.778 --> 01:23:04.512
INVESTIGATION, THEY ATTEND A

01:23:04.579 --> 01:23:05.847
HEARING, THEY CHALLENGE THE

01:23:05.914 --> 01:23:07.782
FINAL JUDGMENT. THEY APPEAL IT.

01:23:07.849 --> 01:23:09.417
AFTER ALL THAT IS DONE, THEY

01:23:09.484 --> 01:23:11.252
KNOW WHAT THEY OWE AND THIS IS

01:23:11.319 --> 01:23:12.821
GOING TO MAKE SURE THEY PAY IT.

01:23:12.887 --> 01:23:15.357
THANK YOU. THANK YOU, MADAM

01:23:15.423 --> 01:23:16.791
CHAIR. MEMBER SARA FLOCKS,

01:23:16.858 --> 01:23:18.426
CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF LABOR

01:23:18.493 --> 01:23:20.695
UNIONS. EARLIER IN THIS HEARING,

01:23:20.762 --> 01:23:23.298
YOU HEARD ABOUT SB 578 ABOUT THE

01:23:23.365 --> 01:23:24.799
IMPORTANCE OF SWAP FUNDING TO

01:23:24.866 --> 01:23:26.067
MAKE SURE WORKERS KNEW THEIR

01:23:26.134 --> 01:23:27.535
RIGHTS AND WERE ABLE TO THEN

01:23:27.602 --> 01:23:29.471
FILE CLAIMS WHEN THERE WERE

01:23:29.537 --> 01:23:31.072
VIOLATIONS, LIKE WAGE THEFT.

01:23:31.139 --> 01:23:33.041
THIS IS THE PERFECT COROLLARY TO

01:23:33.108 --> 01:23:35.110
THAT, BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

01:23:35.176 --> 01:23:36.578
A WORKER LEARNS ABOUT THEIR

01:23:36.644 --> 01:23:38.046
RIGHTS AND THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED

01:23:38.113 --> 01:23:39.781
TO BE PAID MINIMUM WAGE AND THEY

01:23:39.848 --> 01:23:42.984
GO AND FILE, THEY HAVE TO WAIT.

01:23:43.051 --> 01:23:45.553
THEY HAVE TO GO TO A SETTLEMENT

01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:46.221
CONFERENCE WHERE THEY OFTEN HAVE

01:23:46.287 --> 01:23:48.123
TO FACE THEIR EMPLOYER AND

01:23:48.189 --> 01:23:49.958
TESTIFY. WHEN THEIR EMPLOYER HAS

01:23:50.024 --> 01:23:51.025
ALL THE EVIDENCE, THEY HAVE TO

01:23:51.092 --> 01:23:52.994
WAIT AGAIN. THEY HAVE TO FILL

01:23:53.061 --> 01:23:54.662
OUT FORMS. THEY HAVE TO SHOW UP.

01:23:54.729 --> 01:23:56.164
SO THEIR CLAIMS NOT DISMISSED,

01:23:56.231 --> 01:23:57.632
THEY HAVE TO GO TO A HEARING.

01:23:57.699 --> 01:23:59.501
ALL OF THIS CAN TAKE AN AVERAGE

01:23:59.567 --> 01:24:01.202
OF TWO AND A HALF YEARS. DURING

01:24:01.269 --> 01:24:03.138
THE TIME. THEY DO NOT HAVE THE

01:24:03.204 --> 01:24:03.872
WAGES THEY WERE OWED FOR THE

01:24:03.938 --> 01:24:06.441
WORK THEY DID, WHICH MEANS THEY

01:24:06.508 --> 01:24:08.610
MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PAY THEIR

01:24:08.676 --> 01:24:09.711
CELL PHONE BILL, THEIR INTERNET

01:24:09.778 --> 01:24:12.981
PROVIDER, THEIR RENT. SO THEY'RE

01:24:13.047 --> 01:24:14.849
BASICALLY IF THEY CAN HOLD ON TO

01:24:14.916 --> 01:24:17.452
WHEN THEY GET A JUDGMENT,

01:24:17.519 --> 01:24:19.187
EMPLOYERS ARE NOT PAYING FOR SIX

01:24:19.254 --> 01:24:20.789
MONTHS. SO BASICALLY,

01:24:20.855 --> 01:24:22.257
RECALCITRANT EMPLOYERS ARE ABLE

01:24:22.323 --> 01:24:23.792
TO STARVE OUT WORKERS. AND

01:24:23.858 --> 01:24:24.859
THAT'S HOW THEY ARE ABLE TO

01:24:24.926 --> 01:24:27.695
EVADE JUSTICE. IT IS NOT FAIR TO

01:24:27.762 --> 01:24:29.464
PUT WORKERS THROUGH THIS. THIS

01:24:29.531 --> 01:24:32.033
IS A VERY THIS IS A BILL JUST TO

01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:33.935
KIND OF INCREASE THE PENALTIES

01:24:34.002 --> 01:24:36.438
COMMENSURATE TO THE OFFENSE. SO

01:24:36.504 --> 01:24:38.406
IF YOU HAVE STOLEN A BUNCH OF

01:24:38.473 --> 01:24:40.241
WAGES FROM WORKERS, MILLIONS OF

01:24:40.308 --> 01:24:42.777
DOLLARS, THEN THREE TIMES WHAT

01:24:42.844 --> 01:24:45.280
YOU HAVE STOLEN WOULD BE THE

01:24:45.346 --> 01:24:46.414
PENALTY. WE THINK THAT'S ONLY

01:24:46.481 --> 01:24:49.150
FAIR. AND WE URGE YOUR AYE VOTE.

01:24:49.217 --> 01:24:50.852

01:25:59.854 --> 01:26:02.323
I WANT TO THANK SUPERVISOR JUNG

01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:04.092
FOR BEING HERE. I REMEMBER WHEN

01:26:04.158 --> 01:26:05.994
YOU FIRST STARTED THE OFFICE OF

01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:06.995
LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT. IT

01:26:07.061 --> 01:26:08.162
DEFINITELY WAS A HISTORICAL

01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:09.030
MOMENT, NOT JUST FOR SANTA CLARA

01:26:09.097 --> 01:26:11.065
COUNTY, BUT FOR OUR NATION TO BE

01:26:11.132 --> 01:26:12.934
THE FIRST TO LEAD THAT. AND

01:26:13.001 --> 01:26:14.402
YOU'VE DEFINITELY BECOME ONE OF

01:26:14.469 --> 01:26:15.904
THE PREEMINENT, BOTH LEGAL AND

01:26:15.970 --> 01:26:17.038
POLICY MINDS WHEN IT COMES TO

01:26:17.105 --> 01:26:18.373
PROTECTING WORKERS IN THIS

01:26:18.439 --> 01:26:20.108
STATE. AND SO I REALLY

01:26:20.174 --> 01:26:21.075
APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TIME

01:26:21.142 --> 01:26:22.644
TO BE HERE. I KNOW THAT THIS

01:26:22.710 --> 01:26:24.979
WILL BE REFERRED IF IT GETS OUT

01:26:25.046 --> 01:26:26.681
TODAY, WHICH I HOPE IT WILL TO

01:26:26.748 --> 01:26:28.216
JUDICIARY. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO

01:26:28.283 --> 01:26:29.984
THE CONTINUED MOVEMENT OF THIS

01:26:30.051 --> 01:26:32.954
PIECE OF LEGISLATION ONWARD. AND

01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:36.691
SO I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL.

01:26:36.758 --> 01:26:40.194
YES. YES. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO

01:26:40.261 --> 01:26:41.596
THANK OUR COUNTY SUPERVISOR FOR

01:26:41.663 --> 01:26:43.731
COMING ALL THE WAY UP FROM BACK

01:26:43.798 --> 01:26:45.800
HOME. BUT I WANTED TO GIVE YOU A

01:26:45.867 --> 01:26:46.668
CHANCE IF YOU WANTED, SINCE YOU

01:26:46.734 --> 01:26:48.169
WERE VERY INSTRUMENTAL IN

01:26:48.236 --> 01:26:50.271
CREATING THIS, YOU WANT TO BRAG

01:26:50.338 --> 01:26:50.872
ABOUT HOW COUNTY ENFORCEMENT

01:26:50.939 --> 01:26:53.041
MODEL IS A MODEL FOR THE NATION,

01:26:53.107 --> 01:26:53.741
HOW IT'S FAR BETTER THAN THE

01:26:53.808 --> 01:26:55.710
CITY ENFORCEMENT. LET'S BRAG

01:26:55.777 --> 01:26:56.344
ABOUT THAT FOR A SECOND. THANK

01:26:56.411 --> 01:26:59.480
YOU. YEAH. HEY, I FIGHT, WE WIN.

01:26:59.547 --> 01:27:01.983
SO WE ARE THE ONLY PASSIVE

01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:03.418
ENFORCEMENT MODEL IN THE

01:27:03.484 --> 01:27:04.686
COUNTRY. WE'RE THE FIRST ONES.

01:27:04.752 --> 01:27:06.688
AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT IT'S

01:27:06.754 --> 01:27:08.022
VERY ACTIVE. EVEN THOUGH IT

01:27:08.089 --> 01:27:09.057
SOUNDS PASSIVE. WE DON'T HAVE

01:27:09.123 --> 01:27:10.658
POLICE POWERS AS A COUNTY OR

01:27:10.725 --> 01:27:12.393
ENTITY. SO WE DON'T TAKE A

01:27:12.460 --> 01:27:14.295
COMPLAINT AND THEN CONDUCT

01:27:14.362 --> 01:27:15.496
INVESTIGATIONS, SUBPOENAS. AND,

01:27:15.563 --> 01:27:16.864
YOU KNOW, WE KNOW THAT THERE IS

01:27:16.931 --> 01:27:19.968
A WHOLE JUST A WHOLE INVENTORY

01:27:20.034 --> 01:27:21.402
OF UNPAID WAGE THEFT JUDGMENTS

01:27:21.469 --> 01:27:22.403
AMOUNTING TO HUNDREDS OF

01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:23.905
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS STATEWIDE.

01:27:23.972 --> 01:27:26.140
RIGHT. SO WHAT WE DO IS THAT WE

01:27:26.207 --> 01:27:27.108
WORK WITH THE STATE LABOR

01:27:27.175 --> 01:27:28.610
COMMISSIONER AND OUR FEDERAL

01:27:28.676 --> 01:27:30.144
PARTNERS. WE GET THE MOST

01:27:30.211 --> 01:27:31.446
UPDATED LIST OF OUTSTANDING WAGE

01:27:31.512 --> 01:27:33.748
THEFT JUDGMENTS. AND THESE ARE

01:27:33.815 --> 01:27:35.550
APPEALED EXHAUSTED. THEIR FINAL,

01:27:35.617 --> 01:27:37.185
FINAL, FINAL THAT REMAINS

01:27:37.251 --> 01:27:38.453
UNPAID. WE CROSS-REFERENCE THAT

01:27:38.519 --> 01:27:40.188
WITH WHO WE ISSUE PERMITS TO,

01:27:40.254 --> 01:27:41.556
AND WE CHANGE THE COUNTY

01:27:41.623 --> 01:27:43.057
ORDINANCE TO SAY THAT A

01:27:43.124 --> 01:27:43.925
CONDITION OF HAVING YOUR PERMIT

01:27:43.992 --> 01:27:46.060
IS TO ABIDE BY ALL LOCAL, STATE

01:27:46.127 --> 01:27:48.162
AND FEDERAL LABOR LAWS. SO WE'VE

01:27:48.229 --> 01:27:49.797
BEEN ONCE WE SEND A LETTER

01:27:49.864 --> 01:27:50.932
SAYING THAT YOUR PERMIT IS IN

01:27:50.999 --> 01:27:53.835
DANGER. SO FOOD HEALTH PERMITS,

01:27:53.901 --> 01:27:55.970
CONTRACTS WITH THE COUNTY. THE

01:27:56.037 --> 01:27:58.506
JUDGMENTS ARE PAID VERY QUICKLY,

01:27:58.573 --> 01:27:59.941
BUT STILL, THAT ONLY EXISTS IN

01:28:00.008 --> 01:28:02.110
THE REALM OF EXISTING PERMITTING

01:28:02.176 --> 01:28:03.244
RELATIONSHIPS. SO THERE'S STILL

01:28:03.311 --> 01:28:05.780
SO MUCH MORE TO DO. WE GET

01:28:05.847 --> 01:28:06.681
CALLERS AND WORKERS ALL THE TIME

01:28:06.748 --> 01:28:09.117
REACHING OUT TO US, SAYING THAT

01:28:09.183 --> 01:28:09.984
I'M EXPERIENCING WAGE THEFT

01:28:10.051 --> 01:28:12.186
RIGHT NOW. SO THEN WE SEND THEM

01:47:25.372 --> 01:47:27.174
CHAIR, THANK YOU SO MUCH,

01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:28.642
COLLEAGUES. THIS IS A BILL THAT

01:47:28.708 --> 01:47:31.044
IS NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART

01:47:31.111 --> 01:47:31.778
BECAUSE IT'S HAPPENING IN MY

01:47:31.845 --> 01:47:33.713
BACKYARD. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE

01:47:33.780 --> 01:47:35.448
HEARD ABOUT SILICOSIS, BUT IT'S

01:47:35.515 --> 01:47:36.917
HAPPENS WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL WORKS

01:47:36.983 --> 01:47:38.251
ON THE BEAUTIFUL COUNTERTOPS

01:47:38.318 --> 01:47:40.120
THAT SO MANY OF US HAVE IN OUR

01:47:40.187 --> 01:47:41.855
KITCHENS OR ELSEWHERE. BUT WHAT

01:47:41.922 --> 01:47:44.057
HAPPENS IS THAT IF YOU CUT THAT

01:47:44.124 --> 01:47:46.226
INCORRECTLY, YOU CAN ABSORB AND

01:47:46.293 --> 01:47:47.994
INHALE THE SILICA DUST THAT IS

01:47:48.061 --> 01:47:49.996
SO SMALL AND INVISIBLE YOU DON'T

01:47:50.063 --> 01:47:50.997
EVEN KNOW YOU'RE INHALING IT.

01:47:51.064 --> 01:47:52.699
YOU MUST KNOW BECAUSE YOU'RE IN

01:47:52.766 --> 01:47:53.567
THAT WORKPLACE. BUT ONCE YOU'RE

01:47:53.633 --> 01:47:56.069
IN HELL, YOU CAN GET SILICOSIS.

01:47:56.136 --> 01:47:56.870
AND IT'S INCURABLE. AND WHAT

01:47:56.937 --> 01:47:58.572
WE'RE SEEING IS THAT THE YOUNG

01:47:58.638 --> 01:48:01.441
MEN, 98% LATINO MEN WHO ARE

01:48:01.508 --> 01:48:03.643
WORKING IN THESE WORKSHOPS, ARE

01:48:03.710 --> 01:48:04.177
CONTRACTING THIS INCURABLE

01:48:04.244 --> 01:48:07.280
DISEASE, ARE GETTING AN 18 MONTH

01:48:07.347 --> 01:48:10.851
LONG A LEFT DIAGNOSIS TO LIVE

01:48:10.917 --> 01:48:13.053
UNLESS THEY GET A DOUBLE OR A

01:48:13.119 --> 01:48:14.688
SINGLE LUNG TRANSPLANT. AND WHAT

01:48:14.754 --> 01:48:16.590
WE'RE SEEING IS MAJORITY OF THE

01:48:16.656 --> 01:48:17.958
CASES ARE IN LA COUNTY. AND FROM

01:48:18.024 --> 01:48:19.793
THAT MAJORITY OF THOSE CASES ARE

01:48:19.860 --> 01:48:21.061
HAPPENING IN MY DISTRICT,

01:48:21.127 --> 01:48:22.462
PACOIMA AND SUN VALLEY. WHEN WE

01:48:22.529 --> 01:48:24.264
SAW THESE CASES INCREASE, OSHA

01:48:24.331 --> 01:48:26.499
CAME UP WITH SOME EMERGENCY

01:48:26.566 --> 01:48:27.834
REGULATIONS AND THEY RECENTLY

01:48:27.901 --> 01:48:29.803
MADE THEM PERMANENT. HOWEVER,

01:48:29.870 --> 01:48:31.137
THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE THAT

01:48:31.204 --> 01:48:32.572
NEEDS TO HAPPEN BECAUSE EVEN

01:48:32.639 --> 01:48:34.407
SINCE THOSE EMERGENCY

01:48:34.474 --> 01:48:36.209
REGULATIONS, DEATHS HAVE

01:48:36.276 --> 01:48:38.578
OCCURRED, SINCE MY BILL HAS BEEN

01:48:38.645 --> 01:48:39.880
INTRODUCED, WE HAVE NOW

01:48:39.946 --> 01:48:42.349
INCREASED NUMBER OF CASES AND OF

01:48:42.415 --> 01:48:44.784
THIS YEAR THREE MORE DEATHS HAVE

01:48:44.851 --> 01:48:47.354
OCCURRED. SO THIS IS VERY MUCH

01:48:47.420 --> 01:48:48.655
PREVENTABLE. WE NEED TO MAKE

01:48:48.722 --> 01:48:50.523
SURE THAT THERE ARE TRAINING IN

01:48:50.590 --> 01:48:53.059
PLACE TO ENSURE THAT EMPLOYERS

01:48:53.126 --> 01:48:53.627
ARE CERTIFIED, THAT THEY'RE

01:48:53.693 --> 01:48:55.161
TRAINING THEIR INDIVIDUALS. AND

01:48:55.228 --> 01:48:56.963
IN A TIME WHERE PEOPLE ARE

01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:59.900
AFRAID TO HOLD PEOPLE

01:48:59.966 --> 01:49:01.234
ACCOUNTABLE, IF YOU'RE

01:49:01.301 --> 01:49:03.236
UNDOCUMENTED, IF YOU HAVE A WORK

01:49:03.303 --> 01:49:04.704
VISA, IF YOU'RE WORRIED THAT IF

01:49:04.771 --> 01:49:06.439
YOU MAKE ANY KIND OF NOISE, YOU

01:49:06.506 --> 01:49:07.774
COULD BE DEPORTED, IMAGINE

01:49:07.841 --> 01:49:09.242
PEOPLE NOW, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

01:49:09.309 --> 01:49:10.510
WANT TO REPORT THAT THEY'RE

01:49:10.577 --> 01:49:11.745
WORKING IN UNSAFE CONDITIONS AND

01:49:11.811 --> 01:49:13.513
THEY'RE GOING TO STILL GO TO

01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:15.849
WORK, BUT THEY'RE GOING TO END

01:49:15.916 --> 01:49:16.683
UP IT'S GOING TO END UP COSTING

01:49:16.750 --> 01:49:18.652
THEIR LIFE. SO I THINK THIS IS A

01:49:18.718 --> 01:49:20.420
COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO ENSURE

01:49:20.487 --> 01:49:21.588
THAT WE TRAIN INDIVIDUALS TO

01:49:21.655 --> 01:49:22.956
STAY SAFE AND PREVENT SOMETHING

01:49:23.023 --> 01:49:23.857
THAT IS PREVENTABLE. I'M NOT

01:49:23.924 --> 01:49:25.091
GOING TO GO THROUGH EVERYTHING

01:49:25.158 --> 01:49:27.627
IN THE BILL DOES. I KNOW WE

01:49:27.694 --> 01:49:28.295
MEMBERS READ EVERYTHING AND WE

01:49:28.361 --> 01:49:29.663
UNDERSTAND THAT. AND I'D LIKE TO

01:49:29.729 --> 01:49:31.631
TURN OVER TO MY WITNESS IN

01:49:31.698 --> 01:49:32.232
