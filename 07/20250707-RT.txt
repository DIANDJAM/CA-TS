AGE, WITH OUR HOUSING THE WAY IT

00:39:06.877 --> 00:39:08.946
IS, WAY TOO EXPENSIVE. THIS IS

00:39:09.013 --> 00:39:12.450
SOMETIMES THE ONLY MEANS FOR A.

00:39:12.516 --> 00:39:16.887
A CHILD TO OR AN ADULT CHILD TO

00:39:16.954 --> 00:39:18.422
LIVE HERE AFTER THEIR PARENTS

00:39:18.489 --> 00:39:20.491
ARE GONE, BECAUSE THAT FAMILY

00:39:20.558 --> 00:39:22.393
HOME IS THE ONLY THING THEY

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:24.195
HAVE. AND EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY

00:39:24.261 --> 00:39:25.796
HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY PAID DOWN THE

00:39:25.863 --> 00:39:28.165
MORTGAGE, THE PROPERTY TAXES

00:39:28.232 --> 00:39:29.500
THEMSELVES CAN DRIVE THEM OUT

00:39:29.567 --> 00:39:31.836
AND THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO

00:39:31.902 --> 00:39:33.871
ENJOY THE BENEFITS OF HOME

00:39:33.938 --> 00:39:34.438
OWNERSHIP THAT THEIR PARENTS

00:39:34.505 --> 00:39:37.241
WORKED SO HARD FOR THEM TO HAVE.

00:39:37.308 --> 00:39:38.809
THIS ISSUE WITH SIBLING

00:39:38.876 --> 00:39:41.412
TRANSFERS IS A FIRST FIRSTHAND

00:39:41.479 --> 00:39:43.180
KNOWLEDGE ISSUE. I HAD THAT

00:39:43.247 --> 00:39:45.750
ISSUE BEFORE, LONG BEFORE PROP

00:39:45.816 --> 00:39:48.285
19, AND IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO

00:39:48.352 --> 00:39:50.955
BE ABLE TO TRY TO CONSOLIDATE

00:39:51.021 --> 00:39:53.524
INTO ONE PERSON SO THEY CAN DO

00:39:53.591 --> 00:39:56.927
THE WORK. AND IN A STATE

00:39:56.994 --> 00:39:58.729
ENVIRONMENT, THERE'S OTHER PARTS

00:39:58.796 --> 00:40:01.098
OF THE ESTATE THAT THEY CAN

00:40:01.165 --> 00:40:04.001
TRANSFER AROUND SO THAT THE

00:40:04.068 --> 00:40:06.504
TITLE CAN BE HELD, HELD BY THE

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:08.205
ONE PERSON THAT IS GOING TO STAY

00:40:08.272 --> 00:40:10.875
IN THE HOUSE. AND THAT'S THE

00:40:10.941 --> 00:40:12.309
CHILD. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS

00:40:12.376 --> 00:40:13.811
ALL ABOUT. IT'S SUPPOSED TO

00:40:13.878 --> 00:40:17.114
ALLOW THE, THE ONE CHILD TO BE

00:40:17.181 --> 00:40:18.883
ABLE TO INHERIT THE HOUSE

00:40:18.949 --> 00:40:21.118
WITHOUT THAT REASSESSMENT. NOW,

00:40:21.185 --> 00:40:22.720
ARE THERE COMPLEXITIES? YEAH.

00:40:22.787 --> 00:40:25.689
BECAUSE PROP 19 WAS COMPLEX. IT

00:40:25.756 --> 00:40:28.526
WAS NOT IT DID NOT ADDRESS SOME

00:40:28.592 --> 00:40:29.927
OF THESE ISSUES. AND THAT'S WHY

00:40:29.994 --> 00:40:31.829
WE'RE LEFT TO COME BACK AFTER

00:40:31.896 --> 00:40:33.931
THE FACT AND TRY TO CLEAN UP

00:40:33.998 --> 00:40:36.901
SOME OF THOSE, THOSE POINTS. AND

00:40:36.967 --> 00:40:40.471
SO I, YOU KNOW, I, WE ARE GOING

00:40:40.538 --> 00:40:41.972
TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE

00:40:42.039 --> 00:40:43.674
ASSESSOR ON, ON SOME OF THE

00:40:43.741 --> 00:40:45.609
ISSUES THAT THEY HAVE. AND WE

00:40:45.676 --> 00:40:47.945
HAVE WE HAVE GIVEN THEM THAT

00:40:48.012 --> 00:40:52.316
COMMITMENT. AND SO IF THEY HAVE

00:40:52.383 --> 00:40:54.451
OUTSTANDING ISSUES, WE'LL WORK

00:40:54.518 --> 00:40:57.488
WITH THEM. HOWEVER, AT THE END

00:40:57.555 --> 00:40:58.756
OF THE DAY, THIS NEEDS TO BE

00:40:58.823 --> 00:41:00.658
ABLE TO ENABLE THIS PARENT TO

00:41:00.724 --> 00:41:04.228
CHILD TRANSFER, TO BE ABLE TO BE

00:41:04.295 --> 00:41:06.063
DONE THE WAY IT WAS SUPPOSED TO

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:09.133
BE DONE. SO SPECIFICALLY TO

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.968
THEIR ARGUMENT THAT THIS MAY

00:41:11.035 --> 00:41:12.469
REQUIRE A CONSTITUTIONAL

00:41:12.536 --> 00:41:17.341
AMENDMENT, IT IT JUST NEEDS TO

00:41:17.408 --> 00:41:19.009
BE POINTED OUT, POINTED OUT THAT

00:41:19.076 --> 00:41:21.045
THE TAX RAISERS IN THE STATE OF

00:41:21.111 --> 00:41:22.780
CALIFORNIA, THEY DON'T SEEM TO

00:41:22.847 --> 00:41:24.248
HAVE A COHERENT ARGUMENT HERE,

00:41:24.315 --> 00:41:25.382
BECAUSE WHEN THEY OPPOSE

00:41:25.449 --> 00:41:26.817
SOMETHING LIKE THE TAXPAYER

00:41:26.884 --> 00:41:28.319
PROTECTION ACT, THEY SAY THE

00:41:28.385 --> 00:41:30.221
LEGISLATURE SHOULD HAVE THE

00:41:30.287 --> 00:41:31.355
AUTHORITY TO SET TAXES AND MAKE

00:41:31.422 --> 00:41:34.058
THESE RULES AND MAKE MAKE

00:41:34.124 --> 00:41:36.126
REQUIREMENTS. BUT THEN YOU COME

00:41:36.193 --> 00:41:38.596
ALONG AND SAY, OKAY, LET'S HAVE

00:41:38.662 --> 00:41:41.966
THE LEGISLATURE CLARIFY A POORLY

00:41:42.032 --> 00:41:44.935
WRITTEN INITIATIVE, PROP 19. AND

00:41:45.002 --> 00:41:46.837
THEY SUDDENLY SAY, NO, NO, NO,

00:41:46.904 --> 00:41:47.972
NO, NO. THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T

00:41:48.038 --> 00:41:49.940
HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT.

00:41:50.007 --> 00:41:51.342
IT ALWAYS SEEMS TO BE THAT

00:41:51.408 --> 00:41:52.476
WHENEVER THEY GET MORE MONEY,

00:41:52.543 --> 00:41:53.878
IT'S BASED ON THEIR ARGUMENT. SO

00:41:53.944 --> 00:41:56.146
I IF THEY WANT TO RAISE THIS RED

00:41:56.213 --> 00:41:58.883
HERRING ARGUMENT, THAT'S FINE.

00:41:58.949 --> 00:42:00.584
TAKE IT TO COURT. I DON'T THINK

00:42:00.651 --> 00:42:02.920
YOU'RE GOING TO PREVAIL, BUT I

00:42:02.987 --> 00:42:04.655
THINK THE LEGISLATURE IS WELL

00:42:04.722 --> 00:42:07.558
WITHIN ITS AUTHORITY TO MAKE THE

00:42:07.625 --> 00:42:08.092
CLARIFICATION THAT YOU'RE

00:42:08.158 --> 00:42:10.027
SEEKING HERE. AND AGAIN, WE'RE

00:42:10.094 --> 00:42:13.364
TALKING ABOUT FAMILIES WHO

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:15.532
CERTAINLY FIT UNDER THE PROP 19

00:42:15.599 --> 00:42:17.301
FRAMEWORK ALREADY. AND THIS

00:42:17.368 --> 00:42:19.803
SIMPLY JUST PROVIDES A BIT MORE

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:21.305
FLEXIBILITY. I KNOW THAT WE'RE

00:42:21.372 --> 00:42:22.773
LIKELY TO SEE THIS ON SUSPENSE.

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:24.008
MY HOPE IS THAT THE CHAIR WILL

00:42:24.074 --> 00:42:27.678
BE OPEN MINDED WHEN YOU WEIGH

00:42:27.745 --> 00:42:31.649
CONSIDERATION OF THIS IMPORTANT

00:42:31.715 --> 00:42:33.851
RELIEF TO THESE FAMILIES FOR

00:42:33.918 --> 00:42:37.021
HOME HOMEOWNERSHIP RETENTION. SO

00:42:37.087 --> 00:42:39.256
MAY I RESPOND ALSO TO THE

00:42:39.323 --> 00:42:40.391
CONSTITUTIONAL PART OF THIS?

00:42:40.457 --> 00:42:41.759
SURE YOU MAY. YEAH, WE'VE

00:42:41.825 --> 00:42:43.494
RESEARCHED THAT. AND YES, THE

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:44.695
LEGISLATURE HAS AUTHORITY TO

00:42:44.762 --> 00:42:46.397
DEFINE TERMS NOT SPECIFICALLY

00:42:46.463 --> 00:42:49.300
DEFINED IN THE CONSTITUTION.

00:42:49.366 --> 00:42:50.801
FURTHERMORE, THE LEGISLATIVE

00:42:50.868 --> 00:42:52.436
COUNCIL HAS POLICIES SURROUNDING

00:42:52.503 --> 00:42:53.537
LEGISLATION THEY BELIEVE MAY

00:42:53.604 --> 00:42:54.972
VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION.

00:42:55.039 --> 00:42:56.507
NOTHING IN THIS MEASURE HAS

00:42:56.573 --> 00:42:57.541
TRIGGERED THOSE STANDARDS. SO

00:42:57.608 --> 00:42:59.510
NOBODY HAS BROUGHT IT UP IN OUR

00:42:59.576 --> 00:43:03.747
OUR LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. AND IN

00:43:03.814 --> 00:43:06.550
FACT, AS AS STATED BY THE MEMBER

00:43:06.617 --> 00:43:09.186
THERE, THAT DOESN'T REALLY HOLD

00:43:09.253 --> 00:43:11.021
WATER TO SAY IT'S

00:43:11.088 --> 00:43:12.122
UNCONSTITUTIONAL. AT THE END OF

00:43:12.189 --> 00:43:13.424
THE DAY, THE CONSTITUTION SAYS

00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:15.292
PARENTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO GIVE

00:43:15.359 --> 00:43:16.427
IT TO THEIR CHILDREN, AND WHEN

00:43:16.493 --> 00:43:18.595
THERE'S PROBLEMS THERE, WE NEED

00:43:18.662 --> 00:43:20.264
TO BE ABLE TO SORT THOSE OUT AND

00:43:20.331 --> 00:43:21.765
STILL BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THE

00:43:21.832 --> 00:43:24.001
GOAL, WHICH IS HOMEOWNERSHIP FOR

00:43:24.068 --> 00:43:26.770
THOSE CHILDREN. ANY ADDITIONAL

00:43:26.837 --> 00:43:28.772
QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR? I JUST

00:43:28.839 --> 00:43:30.507
WANT TO SAY, I THINK THAT WHEN

00:43:30.574 --> 00:43:31.842
YOU WERE IN THE ASSEMBLY, I

00:43:31.909 --> 00:43:32.810
THINK WE TALKED ABOUT

00:43:32.876 --> 00:43:34.445
PROPOSITION 19 AND HOW YOU'VE

00:43:34.511 --> 00:43:36.246
BEEN WORKING IN TERMS OF TRYING

00:43:36.313 --> 00:43:37.982
TO FIX PROPOSITION 19. I THINK

00:43:38.048 --> 00:43:39.650
THERE'S SOME ISSUES THERE AND

00:43:39.717 --> 00:43:40.985
APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS. AND AT

00:43:41.051 --> 00:43:42.920
THIS TIME YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK

00:43:42.987 --> 00:43:45.122
YOU. I SIMPLY ASK FOR AN AYE

00:43:45.189 --> 00:43:46.323
VOTE WHEN THE TIME COMES. I

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:47.558
THINK ALL THE PREVIOUS COMMENTS

00:43:47.624 --> 00:43:49.960
CAN SERVE AS A CLOSING. THANK

00:43:50.027 --> 00:43:54.465
YOU VERY MUCH. THIS BILL IS.

00:43:54.531 --> 00:43:56.333

ALLOW THE SAN LUIS OBISPO VOTERS

00:46:15.005 --> 00:46:16.073
TO DECIDE IF THE COUNTY OF SAN

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:18.008

CITIES THAT ARE A HALF A CENT.

00:46:58.448 --> 00:47:00.951
AWAY FROM REACHING THE MAXIMUM.

00:47:01.018 --> 00:47:03.487
IF EITHER ONE OF THEM WENT TO

00:47:03.554 --> 00:47:06.056

TO THE DESK. MR. DEMAIO COMES AS

00:49:12.115 --> 00:49:15.152
NO SURPRISE THAT I OPPOSE THIS

00:49:15.218 --> 00:49:19.756
BILL. COST OF LIVING IS A CRISIS

00:49:19.823 --> 00:49:22.192
POINT IN CALIFORNIA. AND YET IT

00:49:22.259 --> 00:49:23.727
IT JUST TAKES MY BREATH AWAY

00:49:23.794 --> 00:49:26.697
WHEN I SEE LEGISLATORS BRING

00:49:26.763 --> 00:49:29.032
FORWARD IDEAS TO MAKE IT EASIER

00:49:29.099 --> 00:49:30.600
TO RAISE TAXES, PARTICULARLY A

00:49:30.667 --> 00:49:32.803
SALES TAX, WHICH IS REGRESSIVE.

00:49:32.869 --> 00:49:35.405
WORKING FAMILIES END UP PAYING

00:49:35.472 --> 00:49:36.840
DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGHER

00:49:36.907 --> 00:49:39.676
BURDENS WITH THE SALES TAX. I'M

00:49:39.743 --> 00:49:42.713
OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER A SALES

00:49:42.779 --> 00:49:46.216
TAX. THAT WAS A NICKEL. YOU ALL

00:49:46.283 --> 00:49:49.386
HAVE TURNED IT INTO A DIME. GOES

00:49:49.453 --> 00:49:52.389
FROM 5% OF EVERY TRANSACTION TO

00:49:52.456 --> 00:49:53.323
10%. AND WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT

00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:55.225
WHEN PEOPLE SAY, WELL, YOU KNOW,

00:49:55.292 --> 00:49:56.860
THINGS HAVE GOTTEN MORE

00:49:56.927 --> 00:49:57.694
EXPENSIVE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:49:57.761 --> 00:49:58.362
PERCENTAGES. GOVERNMENT USED TO

00:49:58.428 --> 00:50:01.798
TAKE A 5% RAKE. YOU CAN SELL A

00:50:01.865 --> 00:50:04.401
HOME FOR LESS THAN 5%. NOW

00:50:04.468 --> 00:50:07.371
THEY'RE DEMANDING A 10% RAKE, AN

00:50:07.437 --> 00:50:10.240
11% RAKE. AND THAT'S JUST

00:50:10.307 --> 00:50:12.809
INSANITY. NOTHING SAYS YOU DON'T

00:50:12.876 --> 00:50:13.977
CARE ABOUT WORKING POOR MORE

00:50:14.044 --> 00:50:15.812
THAN SAYING, I'M GOING TO TAKE

00:50:15.879 --> 00:50:17.581
11% OF EVERY TRANSACTION YOU'RE

00:50:17.647 --> 00:50:20.384
BUYING AT EVERY SINGLE STORE.

00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:21.651
AND I KNOW THAT THE ARGUMENT

00:50:21.718 --> 00:50:22.386
WILL BE MADE. WELL, THEY'RE

00:50:22.452 --> 00:50:24.087
DOING THIS TO THEMSELVES. HAVE

00:50:24.154 --> 00:50:26.123
YOU SEEN YOUR BALLOT TITLES? IT

00:50:26.189 --> 00:50:27.624
SAYS THE SAVE KITTENS AND

00:50:27.691 --> 00:50:29.159
PUPPIES INITIATIVE ON ALL THESE

00:50:29.226 --> 00:50:31.161
TAX INCREASES, AND IT NEVER

00:50:31.228 --> 00:50:32.996
MAKES IT CLEAR THAT PEOPLE ARE

00:50:33.063 --> 00:50:34.798
ACTUALLY VOTING ON A TAX

00:50:34.865 --> 00:50:37.501
INCREASE. AND SO I'M SURE THAT

00:50:37.567 --> 00:50:38.602
THERE'S SOME IMPORTANT PROGRAMS

00:50:38.668 --> 00:50:40.537
THAT YOU'D LIKE TO FUND. I WOULD

00:50:40.604 --> 00:50:42.339
SUGGEST THAT YOU DO WHAT MOST

00:50:42.406 --> 00:50:43.373
WORKING FAMILIES HAVE HAD TO DO

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:47.077
UNDER THIS REGIME OF TAX AND

00:50:47.144 --> 00:50:48.445
SPENDERS. TIGHTEN THE BELT. YOU

00:50:48.512 --> 00:50:50.547
CAN DO A WHOLE BUNCH OF THINGS

00:50:50.614 --> 00:50:53.216
BY TIGHTENING THE BELT, AND WE

00:50:53.283 --> 00:50:55.018
OUGHT TO LEAD BY EXAMPLE IN

00:50:55.085 --> 00:51:00.991
GOVERNMENT. YEAH. MR. MCKENNA,

00:51:01.057 --> 00:51:02.225
YES. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE

00:51:02.292 --> 00:51:03.894
AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:05.762
FORWARD. AS TIGHT AS OUR BUDGET

00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:07.431
IS RIGHT NOW AND THE THINGS THAT

00:51:07.497 --> 00:51:08.965
WE'RE GOING WHAT'S GOING ON IN

00:51:09.032 --> 00:51:10.534
OUR CITIES AND COUNTIES, WE

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:12.569
DEFINITELY NEED THE REVENUE. BUT

00:51:12.636 --> 00:51:13.870
ALSO, YOU KNOW, I'M AGREEING A

00:51:13.937 --> 00:51:16.873
LITTLE BIT WITH MY COLLEAGUE

00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:18.842
HERE. WHEN WE KNOW WE NEED TO

00:51:18.909 --> 00:51:20.777
RAISE, WE NEED TO HAVE SOME

00:51:20.844 --> 00:51:21.845
MONEY, NOT JUST TIGHTEN THE

00:51:21.912 --> 00:51:23.980
BELT, WE NEED TO WE NEED TO PUT

00:51:24.047 --> 00:51:25.148
TAXES ON OUR BILLIONAIRES HERE.

00:51:25.215 --> 00:51:27.117
SO I THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:51:27.184 --> 00:51:27.684
NEEDS TO START. LEGISLATURE

00:51:27.751 --> 00:51:30.020
NEEDS TO START THINKING ABOUT

00:51:30.086 --> 00:51:31.721
TAXING THE BILLIONAIRES, HAVING

00:51:31.788 --> 00:51:33.857
A BILLIONAIRE TAX SO THAT WE CAN

00:51:33.924 --> 00:51:34.991
HAVE THE INCOME TO DO ALL THE

00:51:35.058 --> 00:51:37.093
THINGS WE NEED TO DO IN THE

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:38.495
CITIES AND THE COUNTIES AND

00:51:38.562 --> 00:51:39.896
STATES. I LOOK FORWARD TO

00:51:39.963 --> 00:51:41.398
WORKING WITH MY COLLEAGUE ON

00:51:41.465 --> 00:51:43.867
THAT. I'M SURE HE CAN UNDERSTAND

00:51:43.934 --> 00:51:45.268
TAXING THE BIG, BIG BILLIONAIRES

00:51:45.335 --> 00:51:48.605
AND NOT THE LITTLE PEOPLE. BUT

00:51:48.672 --> 00:51:50.474
WITH THAT, I WILL BE SUPPORTING

00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:54.845
YOUR BILL. THANK YOU. MISS

00:51:54.911 --> 00:51:59.049
QUIRK-SILVA. I APPRECIATE THE

00:51:59.115 --> 00:52:00.484
COMMENTS FROM BOTH OF MY

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:05.455
COLLEAGUES FROM HERE AND THERE.

00:52:05.522 --> 00:52:07.958
COMING FROM A SELF-HELP COUNTY,

00:52:08.024 --> 00:52:09.426
ORANGE COUNTY, AND WHO WOULD

00:52:09.493 --> 00:52:12.295
BELIEVE THEY ACTUALLY TAXED

00:52:12.362 --> 00:52:14.431
THEMSELVES MANY YEARS AGO ON

00:52:14.498 --> 00:52:16.967
TRANSPORTATION AND HAVE BEEN

00:52:17.033 --> 00:52:18.768
EXCELLENT STEWARDS OF THOSE

00:52:18.835 --> 00:52:20.570
DOLLARS, PUTTING IT TO GOOD WORK

00:52:20.637 --> 00:52:24.474
ON OUR ROADS? I DEFINITELY WILL

00:52:24.541 --> 00:52:27.010
BE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY, BUT I

00:52:27.077 --> 00:52:29.579
DO FIND IT INTERESTING. THE

00:52:29.646 --> 00:52:33.817
COMMENTS, AS I BELIEVE JUST

00:52:33.884 --> 00:52:36.386
TODAY AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT,

00:52:36.453 --> 00:52:38.221
THERE WAS A BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL

00:52:38.288 --> 00:52:40.724
THAT WAS JUST SIGNED THAT ADDS

00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:42.125
TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO OUR

00:52:42.192 --> 00:52:45.061
DEFICIT. AND WHO'S THE

00:52:45.128 --> 00:52:46.997
BENEFICIARY OF THAT? CERTAINLY

00:52:47.063 --> 00:52:48.965
NOT OUR LOWEST INCOME

00:52:49.032 --> 00:52:50.734
CALIFORNIANS. MATTER OF FACT

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:52.602
ANALYSIS SAYS THAT THEY WILL

00:52:52.669 --> 00:52:54.838
ACTUALLY BE PAYING MORE PEOPLE

00:52:54.905 --> 00:52:58.375
MAKING UNDER $10,000. WHO OR

00:52:58.441 --> 00:53:01.311
UNDER 30,000 THAT WHEN YOU GET

00:53:01.378 --> 00:53:02.946
TO THOSE VERY LOW INCOMES,

00:53:03.013 --> 00:53:05.882
THEY'RE GOING TO BE PAYING MORE

00:53:05.949 --> 00:53:08.418
COMPARED TO OUR BILLIONAIRES. SO

00:53:08.485 --> 00:53:10.921
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TAXING, LET'S

00:53:10.987 --> 00:53:12.856
TALK ABOUT WHO THE TAX IS

00:53:12.923 --> 00:53:14.090
BENEFIT AND WHO THE PEOPLE ARE

00:53:14.157 --> 00:53:16.826
GOING TO BE PAYING FOR THESE

00:53:16.893 --> 00:53:18.194
TAXES. AND SINCE WE ARE IN THE

00:53:18.261 --> 00:53:20.864
REV, REV AND TAX COMMITTEE, THIS

00:53:20.931 --> 00:53:23.333
IS CERTAINLY OPEN FOR COMMENT.

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:30.440
BUT. ASKING THE VOTERS IN YOUR

00:53:30.507 --> 00:53:32.208
DISTRICT TO SAY YES OR NO,

00:53:32.275 --> 00:53:33.543
BECAUSE WE CERTAINLY ARE SAYING

00:53:33.610 --> 00:53:36.179
YES OR NO. WE'RE SAYING YES TO

00:53:36.246 --> 00:53:39.482
ALLOW THEM TO MAKE THIS DECISION

00:53:39.549 --> 00:53:41.985
FOR THEM IS SOMETHING THAT I DO

00:53:42.052 --> 00:53:44.688
SUPPORT. WITH THAT, I MOVE THE

00:53:44.754 --> 00:53:50.160
BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE

00:53:50.226 --> 00:53:52.062
AUTHOR INDICATED IN HIS OPENING

00:53:52.128 --> 00:53:53.964
THAT HE WILL BE ACCEPTING THE

00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:56.132
AMENDMENTS, AND THAT AGREED TO A

00:53:56.199 --> 00:53:57.467
FIVE YEAR SUNSET, IS THAT

00:53:57.534 --> 00:53:58.301
CORRECT? THANK YOU VERY MUCH,

QUESTIONS THAT HAS BEEN

00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:08.645
ARTICULATED BY MY COLLEAGUES

00:54:08.712 --> 00:54:10.413
HERE IN YOUR CLOSE. THANK YOU

00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:12.882
VERY MUCH. I WOULD JUST SAY THAT

00:54:12.949 --> 00:54:14.651
WE SHOULDN'T TRUST THE VOTERS

00:54:14.718 --> 00:54:17.220
JUST WHEN THEY ELECT US. WE

00:54:17.287 --> 00:54:18.421
SHOULD TRUST THE VOTERS WHEN

00:54:18.488 --> 00:54:20.123
THEY VOTE ON INDIVIDUAL ISSUES

00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:22.158
AS WELL. AND IN THIS CASE, WE'RE

00:54:22.225 --> 00:54:23.994
ALLOWING THEM TO DO A TWO THIRDS

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:25.862
VOTE. WHEN ALL OF US THAT ARE

THEIR RIGHT TO DO IT. THAT'S

00:54:32.636 --> 00:54:34.070
WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO. I

00:54:34.137 --> 00:54:36.539
RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN ITEM.

SMALL TECHNICAL CHANGES TO THE

SB 376, A STRAIGHTFORWARD AND

00:56:04.494 --> 00:56:06.262
NECESSARY MEASURE WHICH

00:56:06.329 --> 00:56:08.331
CLARIFIES HOW CERTAIN TYPES OF

00:56:08.398 --> 00:56:09.699
TRUSTS ARE DEFINED WITHIN

00:56:09.766 --> 00:56:11.668
CALIFORNIA'S TAX LAW. UNDER

00:56:11.735 --> 00:56:12.969
CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW. THE

00:56:13.036 --> 00:56:16.005
STATE ADDRESSES HOW INCOMPLETE

00:56:16.072 --> 00:56:18.842

I'VE LEARNED IS THE TERMINOLOGY

ARE TAXED FOR INCOME PURPOSES.

00:56:23.179 --> 00:56:25.315
THE REVENUE AND TAXATION CODE

00:56:25.381 --> 00:56:27.117
ALSO MIRRORS A FEDERAL PROVISION

00:56:27.183 --> 00:56:29.686
THAT WAS INTENDED TO ENSURE A

00:56:29.753 --> 00:56:31.821
SMOOTH PROCESS IN HOW NGS ARE

00:56:31.888 --> 00:56:33.289
TAXED ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WHILE

00:56:33.356 --> 00:56:34.991
THE INTENT OF THIS CODE SECTION

00:56:35.058 --> 00:56:38.128
IS CLEAR, THERE HAS BEEN

00:56:38.194 --> 00:56:39.362
CONFUSED, THERE HAS BEEN

00:56:39.429 --> 00:56:40.463
CONFUSION ON IF CHARITABLE

00:56:40.530 --> 00:56:43.633
REMAINDER TRUST OR COR ALSO

00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:45.468
QUALIFY AS NGS AND ARE SUBJECT

00:56:45.535 --> 00:56:48.304
TO THE SAME TAXATION RULES. SB

00:56:48.371 --> 00:56:50.440
376 WILL ELIMINATE ANY CONFUSION

00:56:50.507 --> 00:56:53.309
AND REINFORCE THE CRTS ARE NOT

00:56:53.376 --> 00:56:55.245
SUBJECT TO THE SAME RULES THAT

00:56:55.311 --> 00:56:56.679
NGS ARE UNDER CALIFORNIA'S TAX

00:56:56.746 --> 00:56:58.748
CODE. THIS WILL CODIFY HOW THE

00:56:58.815 --> 00:57:00.550
FRANCHISE TAX BOARD HAS

00:57:00.617 --> 00:57:01.985
CONSISTENTLY INTERPRETED THE LAW

UP UNTIL NOW, AND WILL PROVIDE

00:57:04.287 --> 00:57:05.855
MUCH NEEDED CLARITY FOR THIS.

TAX PROFESSIONALS, ESTATE

00:57:08.458 --> 00:57:10.727
PLANNERS AND WILL PREVENT ANY

00:57:10.794 --> 00:57:12.495
UNINTENDED TAX CONSEQUENCES.

00:57:12.562 --> 00:57:13.930

00:57:13.997 --> 00:57:15.365
THIS BILL IS MARK MULLIN FROM

00:57:15.431 --> 00:57:17.066
THE CALIFORNIA LAWYERS

00:57:17.133 --> 00:57:18.968

00:57:20.904 --> 00:57:22.939
THANK YOU, CHAIR AND MEMBERS. MY

NAME IS MARK MULLIN. I'M HERE ON

00:57:25.375 --> 00:57:26.309
BEHALF OF THE TAXATION SECTION

00:57:26.376 --> 00:57:27.944
OF THE CALIFORNIA LAWYERS

00:57:28.011 --> 00:57:28.978
ASSOCIATION, WHICH IS A

00:57:29.045 --> 00:57:30.547
CO-SPONSOR OF SB 376, TOGETHER

00:57:30.613 --> 00:57:31.581
WITH THE TRUST AND ESTATE

00:57:31.648 --> 00:57:33.583
SECTION OF CLA. I'M AN ESTATE

00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:34.684
PLANNING ATTORNEY AND A COUNCIL

00:57:34.751 --> 00:57:37.086
OF CHURCHES FREE LLP IN SAN

00:57:37.153 --> 00:57:38.388
FRANCISCO. I'M FAMILIAR WITH THE

00:57:38.454 --> 00:57:39.722
INCOME TAX ISSUES ASSOCIATED

00:57:39.789 --> 00:57:40.990
WITH THE TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF

00:57:41.057 --> 00:57:42.759
TRUST AT ISSUE IN THIS BILL, AND

00:57:42.826 --> 00:57:44.093
CAN ILLUSTRATE HOW THE ISSUES

00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:46.029
RAISED BY THIS BILL COME UP IN

00:57:46.095 --> 00:57:47.564
THE REAL WORLD. NGS ARE TRUSTS

00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:49.599
THAT ARE DESIGNED TO AVOID STATE

00:57:49.666 --> 00:57:51.034
INCOME TAX. THAT CHANGED WITH

00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:52.502
THE ENACTMENT OF REVENUE AND

00:57:52.569 --> 00:57:55.638
TAXATION CODE 1708 TWO AND 2023

00:57:55.705 --> 00:57:57.440
UNDER THAT SECTION, NGS, AS

00:57:57.507 --> 00:57:59.309
DEFINED IN THAT SECTION THAT ARE

00:57:59.375 --> 00:58:00.610
CREATED BY CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS,

00:58:00.677 --> 00:58:02.679
NOW HAVE THEIR INCOME SUBJECT TO

00:58:02.745 --> 00:58:05.748
CALIFORNIA INCOME TAX. CRT AND

00:58:05.815 --> 00:58:07.483
CONTRAST ARE DESIGNED TO BENEFIT

00:58:07.550 --> 00:58:09.052
CHARITIES TO PROMOTE THEIR USE.

00:58:09.118 --> 00:58:11.221
THEY ARE GIVEN FEDERAL TAX

00:58:11.287 --> 00:58:13.590
BENEFITS. CALIFORNIA CONFORMS TO

00:58:13.656 --> 00:58:15.525
THE FEDERAL RULES GOVERNING

00:58:15.592 --> 00:58:17.293
CRTS. THE DESIGN AND STRUCTURE

00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:19.062
OF THE TWO TRUSTS DIFFER

00:58:19.128 --> 00:58:20.129
SIGNIFICANTLY. THEY ARE CREATED

00:58:20.196 --> 00:58:22.031
FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES. NOBODY

00:58:22.098 --> 00:58:23.266
IN THE ESTATE PLANNING SPACE

00:58:23.333 --> 00:58:25.568
WOULD EVER REFER TO A CRT AS A

00:58:25.635 --> 00:58:26.970
DING. HOWEVER, AS A RESULT OF

00:58:27.036 --> 00:58:28.271
THE TECHNICAL DEFINITION OF AN

00:58:28.338 --> 00:58:31.341
NG IN SECTION 1708, TWO CERTAIN

00:58:31.407 --> 00:58:33.509
CRTS COULD BE TREATED AS INGS,

00:58:33.576 --> 00:58:34.978
THEREBY LOSING THE FAVORABLE TAX

00:58:35.044 --> 00:58:36.379
TREATMENT AND DISCOURAGING

00:58:36.446 --> 00:58:38.548
INDIVIDUALS FROM CREATING CRT

00:58:38.615 --> 00:58:39.983
THAT COULD RESULT IN LESS

00:58:40.049 --> 00:58:42.118
CHARITABLE GIVING. SB 376 WOULD

00:58:42.185 --> 00:58:43.486
AVOID THIS RESULT BY AMENDING

00:58:43.553 --> 00:58:45.154
THE STATUTE TO CLARIFY THAT THE

00:58:45.221 --> 00:58:46.589
DEFINITION OF AN NG DOES NOT

00:58:46.656 --> 00:58:48.758
INCLUDE THE CRT, CONSISTENT WITH

00:58:48.825 --> 00:58:51.127
WHAT THE FTB HAS SAID, I WOULD

00:58:51.194 --> 00:58:52.996
BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS

00:58:53.062 --> 00:58:54.797

REASONABLE CAUSE AND NOT DUE TO

01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:02.545
WILLFUL NEGLECT. BY INSTITUTING

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:04.847
A MODEST TIERED PENALTY SYSTEM,

01:03:04.914 --> 01:03:06.616
THE BILL PRESERVES THE INTEGRITY

01:03:06.682 --> 01:03:09.252

INCURRING PENALTIES THAT ARE

01:03:13.189 --> 01:03:16.792
EXCESSIVELY PUNITIVE. UNDER SB

01:03:16.859 --> 01:03:18.561
591. THE PENALTY FITS THE

01:03:18.628 --> 01:03:21.797
VIOLATION. BEFORE I HAND IT OVER

01:03:21.864 --> 01:03:23.466
TO MY WITNESS, I WANT TO

01:03:23.533 --> 01:03:25.001
HIGHLIGHT THAT THIS BILL HAS

01:03:25.067 --> 01:03:26.836
RECEIVED NO NO VOTES AND HAS

01:03:26.903 --> 01:03:29.272
RECEIVED NO OPPOSITION AND IS

01:03:29.338 --> 01:03:31.541
BIPARTISAN TODAY. TO TESTIFY IN

01:03:31.607 --> 01:03:33.309
SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS MARK

01:03:33.376 --> 01:03:35.845
APREA ON BEHALF OF

01:03:35.912 --> 01:03:37.680
PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS. MR.

01:03:37.747 --> 01:03:39.081
CHAIR, MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE,

01:03:39.148 --> 01:03:41.651
MARK, WITH CAPITAL ADVOCACY ON

01:03:41.717 --> 01:03:43.486
BEHALF OF PRICEWATERHOUSE

01:03:43.553 --> 01:03:46.722
COOPERS IN SUPPORT OF SB 591.

01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:48.424
FIRST, WE WANT TO THANK SENATOR

01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:49.959
VALLADARES AND THE BIPARTISAN

01:03:50.026 --> 01:03:51.627
GROUP OF SENATE AND ASSEMBLY

01:03:51.694 --> 01:03:53.829
COAUTHORS FOR INTRODUCING THIS

01:03:53.896 --> 01:03:55.431
MEASURE, WHICH SEEKS TO LIMIT

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:57.233
THE PENALTY FOR FAILURE TO PAY

01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:59.101
THE PERSONAL OR CORPORATE INCOME

01:03:59.168 --> 01:04:02.939
TAX THROUGH AN EFT TRANSFER TO

01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:05.308
$100 FOR A FIRST TIME OFFENSE

01:04:05.374 --> 01:04:08.244
AND $500 FOR EACH SUBSEQUENT

01:04:08.311 --> 01:04:10.413
VIOLATION. UNDER EXISTING LAW.

01:04:10.479 --> 01:04:12.215
LET'S SAY AN INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYER

01:04:12.281 --> 01:04:14.350
REQUIRED TO PAY VIA ELECTRONIC

01:04:14.417 --> 01:04:16.552
FUND TRANSFER MAKES AN ESTIMATED

01:04:16.619 --> 01:04:19.722
TAX PAYMENT BY CHECK OF $60

01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:22.992
MILLION. THE PENALTY IS $600,000

01:04:23.059 --> 01:04:25.261
PLUS INTEREST. THE PENALTY IS

01:04:25.328 --> 01:04:27.330
NOT REDUCED IF IT'S LATER

01:04:27.396 --> 01:04:28.764
DETERMINED THAT THE TAXPAYER

01:04:28.831 --> 01:04:31.167
ONLY NEEDED TO MAKE A $30

01:04:31.234 --> 01:04:33.436
MILLION ESTIMATED TAX PAYMENT.

01:04:33.502 --> 01:04:36.339
UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES, THE

01:04:36.405 --> 01:04:38.474
TAXPAYER REQUESTED A WAIVER.

01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:39.875
UNFORTUNATELY, THE FTB DENIED

01:04:39.942 --> 01:04:43.279
THAT REQUEST. IN THIS INSTANCE,

01:04:43.346 --> 01:04:45.748
THERE WAS NO FRAUD, THERE WAS NO

01:04:45.815 --> 01:04:46.949
UNDERPAYMENT, THERE WAS NO DELAY

01:04:47.016 --> 01:04:49.385
IN PAYMENT. THE ERROR WAS SIMPLY

01:04:49.452 --> 01:04:52.989
THAT THE AMOUNT PAID WAS PAID BY

01:04:53.055 --> 01:04:55.524
CHECK, NOT EFT, AND THEREFORE

01:04:55.591 --> 01:04:58.261
THEY WERE REQUIRED TO PAY A

01:04:58.327 --> 01:05:00.596
$600,000 PENALTY. THIS IS AN

01:05:00.663 --> 01:05:02.231
EGREGIOUS EXAMPLE OF HOW THE

01:05:02.298 --> 01:05:04.700
EXISTING PENALTIES UNDER THE TAX

01:05:04.767 --> 01:05:06.636
CODE AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION ARE

01:05:06.702 --> 01:05:09.205
NOT COMMENSURATE WITH THE

01:05:09.272 --> 01:05:11.974
ASSOCIATED VIOLATION. BUT IF

01:05:12.041 --> 01:05:14.510
SENATE BILL 591 WILL NOT MAKE

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:16.612
CALIFORNIA AN OUTLIER TO THE

01:05:16.679 --> 01:05:18.848
CONTRARY, OF THE 41 STATES THAT

01:05:18.914 --> 01:05:22.118
HAVE A PERSONAL INCOME TAX, 32

01:05:22.184 --> 01:05:24.320
HAVE A PENALTY FOR FAILURE TO

01:05:24.387 --> 01:05:28.391
PAY VIA EFT. SB 591 WILL PROVIDE

01:05:28.457 --> 01:05:30.393
THAT. CALIFORNIA IS IN LINE WITH

01:05:30.459 --> 01:05:32.295
MANY OF THE STATES THAT DO, SUCH

01:05:32.361 --> 01:05:34.764
AS THE COMMONWEALTH OF

01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:36.098
MASSACHUSETTS, WHICH PROVIDE A

01:05:36.165 --> 01:05:40.169
PENALTY OF $100 PER VIOLATION.

01:05:40.236 --> 01:05:43.039
FURTHER. AND FINALLY, SB 591

01:05:43.105 --> 01:05:45.574
WILL MAKE A VIOLATION BY A

01:05:45.641 --> 01:05:47.943
TAXPAYER TO BE IN LINE WITH A

01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:50.913
TAX PREPARERS VIOLATION UNDER

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:55.151
CALIFORNIA TAX CODE 19170. IF A

01:05:55.217 --> 01:05:58.054
TAX PREPARER FAILS TO FILE A

01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:00.256
REQUIRED RETURN ELECTRONICALLY,

01:06:00.323 --> 01:06:03.125
THEY ARE SUBJECT TO A PENALTY OF

01:06:03.192 --> 01:06:05.027
$50 FOR EACH FAILURE, AND THERE

01:06:05.094 --> 01:06:07.797
IS NO RATCHETING UP FOR

01:06:07.863 --> 01:06:10.733
SUBSEQUENT FOR SUBSEQUENT

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:12.335
VIOLATIONS. SO, AS REFLECTED IN

01:06:12.401 --> 01:06:14.003
THE ANALYSIS, WE KNOW THIS

01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:15.638
MEASURE IS SUBJECT TO THE

01:06:15.705 --> 01:06:17.807
SUSPENSE FILE. WE WOULD SUBMIT,

01:06:17.873 --> 01:06:20.009
HOWEVER, THAT THE STATE OF

01:06:20.076 --> 01:06:21.177
CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT BALANCE

01:06:21.243 --> 01:06:24.046
ITS BUDGET BY IMPOSING EGREGIOUS

01:06:24.113 --> 01:06:26.215
PENALTIES, NO MATTER THE

01:06:26.282 --> 01:06:27.249
CIRCUMSTANCES. RATHER, WE ASK

01:06:27.316 --> 01:06:29.719
THAT YOU PRESERVE THE INTEGRITY

01:06:29.785 --> 01:06:32.254
OF THE EFT REQUIREMENT WHILE

01:06:32.321 --> 01:06:33.222
PREVENTING TAXPAYERS FROM

01:06:33.289 --> 01:06:35.558
INCURRING PENALTIES THAT ARE

01:06:35.624 --> 01:06:37.259
EXCESSIVELY PUNITIVE. WE

01:06:37.326 --> 01:06:38.394
RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR

01:06:38.461 --> 01:06:41.597
SUPPORT OF SB 591. THANK YOU.

01:06:41.664 --> 01:06:42.932
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANYONE IN

01:06:42.998 --> 01:06:44.767

01:06:51.073 --> 01:06:52.074
GOOD AFTERNOON, CHAIR AND

01:06:52.141 --> 01:06:53.509
MEMBERS, JENNIFER TANNEHILL WITH

01:06:53.576 --> 01:06:55.444
AARON READ AND ASSOCIATES ON

01:06:55.511 --> 01:06:56.746
BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY

01:06:56.812 --> 01:06:58.547
OF ENROLLED AGENTS IN SUPPORT.

01:06:58.614 --> 01:07:01.117
THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:07:01.183 --> 01:07:02.651
ANYONE IN THE ROOM IN

01:07:02.718 --> 01:07:04.987
OPPOSITION? PRIMARY OPPOSITION.

01:07:05.054 --> 01:07:06.856
I KNOW THERE WAS NONE

01:07:06.922 --> 01:07:08.657
REGISTERED, NO PRIMARY

01:07:08.724 --> 01:07:10.059
OPPOSITION. ANYONE IN THE ROOM

01:07:10.126 --> 01:07:11.861
WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION

01:07:11.927 --> 01:07:14.130
IN THE ROOM. PLEASE COME TO THE

01:07:14.196 --> 01:07:15.464
MICROPHONE WITH YOUR NAME, YOUR

01:07:15.531 --> 01:07:16.499
ORGANIZATION AND OPPOSITION

01:07:16.565 --> 01:07:19.301
SEEING NONE. WANT TO BRING IT

01:07:19.368 --> 01:07:21.170
BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. ANY. MISS

01:07:21.237 --> 01:07:23.305
QUIRK-SILVA, I SUPPORT THE BILL,

01:07:23.372 --> 01:07:26.242
BUT I'M JUST KIND OF PERPLEXED

01:07:26.308 --> 01:07:30.045
OF WHY IS IT SUCH A BIG DEAL TO

01:07:30.112 --> 01:07:32.448
GET A CHECK VERSUS AN ELECTRIC

01:07:32.515 --> 01:07:34.650
ELECTRONIC TRANSFER? AND WHEN

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:38.154
DID THIS BECOME A PROBLEM? SO I

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:41.891
WOULD THIS THE EXAMPLE THAT I

01:07:41.957 --> 01:07:43.592
PROVIDED TO YOU WAS A REAL

01:07:43.659 --> 01:07:45.394
EXAMPLE. WE OF COURSE DID NOT

01:07:45.461 --> 01:07:48.631
WANT TO NAME THE TAXPAYER FOR

01:07:48.697 --> 01:07:50.699
RIGHTS OF FOR THEIR

01:07:50.766 --> 01:07:51.867
CONFIDENTIALITY. BUT I WOULD

01:07:51.934 --> 01:07:54.470
POINT OUT TO OUR KNOWLEDGE THAT

01:07:54.537 --> 01:07:56.071
THESE ARE NOT ERRORS OF

01:07:56.138 --> 01:07:58.274
COMMISSION, BUT RATHER THEY ARE

01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:00.976
ERRORS WHEREBY THE TAXPAYER IS

01:08:01.043 --> 01:08:03.312
EITHER IMPROPERLY ADVISED OR OR

01:08:03.379 --> 01:08:05.381
MAKES A MISTAKE. BUT THESE

01:08:05.448 --> 01:08:08.017
MISTAKES HAVE SIGNIFICANT

01:08:08.083 --> 01:08:09.418
CONSEQUENCES. AND GIVEN THE

01:08:09.485 --> 01:08:11.654
HISTORY WHERE THE FTB IS NOT

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:13.622
WAIVED, THE PENALTY, WE WERE

01:08:13.689 --> 01:08:14.924
COMPELLED TO BRING THE MATTER TO

01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:18.060
THE LEGISLATURE. NO, I DON'T

01:08:18.127 --> 01:08:19.562
DISAGREE. IT JUST SEEMS TO ME

01:08:19.628 --> 01:08:22.398
LIKE WHAT IS THE BIAS AGAINST

01:08:22.465 --> 01:08:24.433
CHECKS? OR I MEAN, IT SEEMS LIKE

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:26.035
THERE'S STILL PEOPLE THAT DO,

01:08:26.101 --> 01:08:27.803
I'M SURE, A DWINDLING AMOUNT.

01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:29.705
BUT AND AGAIN, WE'RE NOT GOING

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:31.140
TO JUST AN OPINION HERE. LIKE

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:32.641
I'M HAVING A HARD TIME

01:08:32.708 --> 01:08:33.943
UNDERSTANDING WHY IT'S AN ISSUE.

01:08:34.009 --> 01:08:36.512
BUT I DO DEFER TO YOU. THANK

01:08:36.579 --> 01:08:39.248
YOU. AND IF I MAY, MR. CHAIR, I

01:08:39.315 --> 01:08:41.183
AGREE WITH YOU, WHICH IS WHY I

01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:42.585
DECIDED TO TAKE ON THIS BILL,

01:08:42.651 --> 01:08:43.786
BECAUSE YOU SHOULDN'T BE

01:08:43.853 --> 01:08:45.454
PENALIZED FOR WANTING TO PAY BY

01:08:45.521 --> 01:08:48.224
A CHECK. AND I THINK THE FEES

01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:52.228
ARE FAIR. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR

01:08:52.294 --> 01:08:55.598
SUPPORT. AN ADDITIONAL QUESTION.

01:08:55.664 --> 01:08:58.400
I HAVE A QUESTION. HOW COMMON IS

01:08:58.467 --> 01:09:00.870
THIS OCCUR? HOW OFTEN DOES THIS

01:09:00.936 --> 01:09:04.139
OCCUR? WELL, WE DID INQUIRE WITH

01:09:04.206 --> 01:09:07.109
THE FTB AS TO THE AS WE BROUGHT

01:09:07.176 --> 01:09:08.344
THIS MEASURE FORWARD. THEY DID

01:09:08.410 --> 01:09:10.980
NOT PROVIDE US WITH ANY SPECIFIC

01:09:11.046 --> 01:09:12.748
DATA. BUT AND IT IS NOT WHAT

01:09:12.815 --> 01:09:15.251
WE'RE TOLD IS, IS A COMMON

01:09:15.317 --> 01:09:17.653
PRACTICE, BUT IT DOES HAPPEN.

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:20.322
AND TO FOLLOW UP ON ASSEMBLY

01:09:20.389 --> 01:09:22.625
MEMBER QUIRK-SILVA QUESTION,

01:09:22.691 --> 01:09:25.794
THERE IS AN INTEREST IN THE FTB

01:09:25.861 --> 01:09:27.930
RECEIVING ELECTRONIC FUNDS

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:29.164
TRANSFERS, PARTICULARLY FOR

01:09:29.231 --> 01:09:31.166
LARGE AMOUNTS, SO THAT IT'S

01:09:31.233 --> 01:09:32.735
BETTER OR EASIER AND MORE SECURE

01:09:32.801 --> 01:09:35.871
FOR THEM TO MANAGE FUNDS. THAT

01:09:35.938 --> 01:09:38.040
SAID, THERE IS A TOTAL

01:09:38.107 --> 01:09:39.842
DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE

01:09:39.909 --> 01:09:41.310
VIOLATION, THE RISK TO THE

01:09:41.377 --> 01:09:43.412
STATE, THE BURDEN TO THE STATE

01:09:43.479 --> 01:09:45.614
TO ACTUALLY HAVE TO DEPOSIT A

01:09:45.681 --> 01:09:47.783
CHECK AND THE PENALTIES THAT ARE

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:49.285
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. AND AGAIN,

01:09:49.351 --> 01:09:51.053
WE WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THAT THIS

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:53.188
IS IN LINE WITH WHAT OTHER

01:09:53.255 --> 01:09:54.690
STATES DO AND THOSE OTHER STATES

01:09:54.757 --> 01:09:56.792
THAT DO HAVE A PENALTY, THAT

01:09:56.859 --> 01:09:58.928
IT'S IN LINE WITH THOSE.

01:09:58.994 --> 01:10:00.629
FURTHERMORE, IT'S IN LINE WITH

01:10:00.696 --> 01:10:02.598
CALIFORNIA STATUTE WHEN A TAX

01:10:02.665 --> 01:10:04.934
PREPARER WHO FAILS TO FILE

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.302
ELECTRONICALLY AS THEY ARE

01:10:06.368 --> 01:10:08.070
REQUIRED, WHEN THEY ARE REQUIRED

01:10:08.137 --> 01:10:10.139
TO DO SO, THEY HAVE A $50

01:10:10.205 --> 01:10:12.575
PENALTY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO

01:10:12.641 --> 01:10:14.443
IT'S SUPPOSED TO ENCOURAGE, BUT

01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:16.278
WE DON'T THINK IT OUGHT TO BE

01:10:16.345 --> 01:10:17.613
SOMETHING WHERE YOU ARE, YOU

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:20.783
KNOW, YOU KNOW, EGREGIOUSLY

01:10:20.849 --> 01:10:22.685
PENALIZED AS IN THE EXAMPLE I

01:10:22.751 --> 01:10:24.587
PROVIDED YOU. SURE. THANK YOU

01:10:24.653 --> 01:10:26.622
VERY MUCH, SENATOR. YOU MAY

01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:28.223
CLOSE. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. I

01:10:28.290 --> 01:10:29.792
WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR

01:10:29.858 --> 01:10:31.327
THEIR CONSIDERATION OF THIS

01:10:31.393 --> 01:10:32.728
LEGISLATION. IT WILL

01:10:32.795 --> 01:10:33.796
MEANINGFULLY IMPROVE

01:10:33.862 --> 01:10:34.763
CALIFORNIA'S TAX ADMINISTRATION

01:10:34.830 --> 01:10:38.167
AND PROMOTE A FAIR ENVIRONMENT

01:10:38.233 --> 01:10:39.635
FOR TAXPAYERS. IN A TIME WHEN

01:10:39.702 --> 01:10:41.637
TAXPAYERS ARE ASKING US TO FOCUS

01:10:41.704 --> 01:10:43.339
ON AFFORDABILITY. THIS BILL DOES

01:10:43.405 --> 01:10:44.907
EXACTLY THAT. AND FOR THOSE

01:10:44.974 --> 01:10:46.141
REASONS, I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR

01:10:46.208 --> 01:10:48.243
YOUR AYE VOTE WHEN THE TIME IS

01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:49.278

VERY MUCH, MR. CHAIR. AND

01:11:18.774 --> 01:11:20.009
MEMBERS, I'M HERE TODAY TO

01:11:20.075 --> 01:11:22.444
PRESENT SB 419, THE HYDROGEN

01:11:22.511 --> 01:11:25.648
FUEL TAX ACT, TO ENSURE THAT

01:11:25.714 --> 01:11:27.583
CALIFORNIA'S SYSTEM TAX SYSTEM

01:11:27.650 --> 01:11:29.451
DOES NOT DISCOURAGE THE ADOPTION

01:11:29.518 --> 01:11:31.420
OF CLEAN ENERGY. OUR STATE HAS

01:11:31.487 --> 01:11:32.888
LONG BEEN A PIONEER PIONEER IN

01:11:32.955 --> 01:11:35.290
CLEAN ENERGY AND ZERO EMISSION

01:11:35.357 --> 01:11:36.959
VEHICLES. YET OUR CURRENT TAX

01:11:37.026 --> 01:11:38.327
STRUCTURE PENALIZES HYDROGEN

01:11:38.394 --> 01:11:40.295
POWERED VEHICLES BY SUBJECTING

01:11:40.362 --> 01:11:42.598
THEM TO DOUBLE TAXATION.

01:11:42.665 --> 01:11:43.732
HYDROGEN POWERED VEHICLES

01:11:43.799 --> 01:11:45.467
CURRENTLY PAY BOTH A SALES AND

01:11:45.534 --> 01:11:47.936

01:11:50.205 --> 01:11:52.574
AT REGISTRATION, A BURDEN THAT

01:11:52.641 --> 01:11:54.109
DOESN'T APPLY TO GAS POWERED

01:11:54.176 --> 01:11:55.878
VEHICLES. THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS

01:11:55.944 --> 01:11:57.212
OUTDATED, RESULTING IN AN

01:11:57.279 --> 01:11:58.847
UNNECESSARY FINANCIAL HURDLE FOR

01:11:58.914 --> 01:12:00.616
THOSE SEEKING TO TRANSITION TO

01:12:00.683 --> 01:12:03.385
CLEAN ENERGY. SB 419 WOULD

01:12:03.452 --> 01:12:05.921
PARTIALLY EXEMPT HYDROGEN FUEL

01:12:05.988 --> 01:12:08.057
FROM THE STATE'S PORTION OF THE

01:12:08.123 --> 01:12:09.892
SALES AND USE TAX, AND DOES NOT

01:12:09.958 --> 01:12:12.161
CHANGE THE EXISTING $100 ANNUAL

01:12:12.227 --> 01:12:14.096
ROAD IMPROVEMENT FEE TO ENSURE

01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:15.597
THAT TRANSPORTATION

01:12:15.664 --> 01:12:17.199
INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING REMAINS

01:12:17.266 --> 01:12:19.001

01:12:19.068 --> 01:12:20.335
ADOPTION MORE FINANCIALLY

01:12:20.402 --> 01:12:22.304
FEASIBLE. THIS BILL IS A COMMON

01:12:22.371 --> 01:12:23.639
SENSE SOLUTION THAT PROMOTES

01:12:23.706 --> 01:12:25.374
FAIRNESS, ENCOURAGES CLEAN

01:12:25.441 --> 01:12:26.842
ENERGY ADOPTION, AND ENSURES

01:12:26.909 --> 01:12:29.044
ECONOMIC VIABILITY FOR HYDROGEN

01:12:29.111 --> 01:12:31.613
POWERED VEHICLES. I RESPECTFULLY

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:33.415
ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TO ENSURE

01:12:33.482 --> 01:12:35.050
THAT TAX POLICIES ALIGN WITH OUR

01:12:35.117 --> 01:12:37.019
CLIMATE AND CLEAN ENERGY

COMMITMENTS TO MAKE CALIFORNIA'S

HYDROGEN FUTURE EQUITABLE,

01:12:40.556 --> 01:12:41.890
SUSTAINABLE AND COMPETITIVE.

01:12:41.957 --> 01:12:43.258

01:12:43.325 --> 01:12:45.160

01:12:49.798 --> 01:12:51.100
THANK YOU. I'M TOM KNOX VALLEY

01:12:51.166 --> 01:12:53.335
CLEAN AIR. NOW WE WERE FORTUNATE

01:12:53.402 --> 01:12:55.704
TO BE ABLE TO DONATE 47 USED

01:12:55.771 --> 01:12:57.773
MIRAI FUEL CELL VEHICLES TO LOW

01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:59.375
INCOME DRIVERS AND SEVERELY

01:12:59.441 --> 01:13:00.676
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES, BOTH

01:13:00.743 --> 01:13:03.946
RURAL AND URBAN, IN SOUTH LA. TO

01:13:04.012 --> 01:13:06.648
SEE ARE THESE VIABLE OPTIONS FOR

01:13:06.715 --> 01:13:07.783
AREAS WITH A LOT OF CHALLENGES

01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:09.718
IN ACCESSING EV CHARGING? WHAT

01:13:09.785 --> 01:13:11.987
WE FOUND OUT WAS SURPRISING

01:13:12.054 --> 01:13:13.989
THESE CUSTOMERS LOVE THEIR FUEL

01:13:14.056 --> 01:13:15.424
CELL VEHICLES. WE DIDN'T HEAR

01:13:15.491 --> 01:13:16.058
ABOUT THE FUELING STATIONS. WE

01:13:16.125 --> 01:13:17.726
DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT ANY

01:13:17.793 --> 01:13:18.627
CHALLENGES. WHAT WE DO HEAR

01:13:18.694 --> 01:13:20.496
ABOUT ALL THE TIME IS THE COST.

01:13:20.562 --> 01:13:21.096
THESE CUSTOMERS ARE SAYING WE

01:13:21.163 --> 01:13:23.398
FOUND THE PERFECT OPTION FOR

01:13:23.465 --> 01:13:24.133
CLEAN, RELIABLE, BUT WE'RE

01:13:24.199 --> 01:13:25.200
CONCERNED THAT THE COST OF

01:13:25.267 --> 01:13:26.602
HYDROGEN IS SO MUCH THAT WE

01:13:26.668 --> 01:13:27.903
CAN'T CONTINUE DRIVING THESE

01:13:27.970 --> 01:13:29.171
VEHICLES AFTER OUR FUEL CARD

01:13:29.238 --> 01:13:30.939
VALUE RUNS OUT. SO THIS BILL, I

01:13:31.006 --> 01:13:33.008
THINK, IS A MAJOR STEP TOWARD

01:13:33.075 --> 01:13:34.576
SHOWING THESE CUSTOMERS THAT THE

01:13:34.643 --> 01:13:35.944
STATE DOES HAVE A PLAN TO START

01:13:36.011 --> 01:13:38.046
TO REDUCE THE COST OF HYDROGEN,

01:13:38.113 --> 01:13:39.314
TO RESTORE FAIRNESS TO ALL TYPES

01:13:39.381 --> 01:13:41.383
OF EVS. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH

01:13:41.450 --> 01:13:42.885
FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK

TYPICALLY TAXED AS A MERCHANT

COMMODITY. IT'S USED IN

YES, MISS MCKENNA? YES. I'M

01:16:01.089 --> 01:16:03.492
LOOKING AT THE PRICE OF THE

01:16:03.558 --> 01:16:05.794
SAVINGS, YOU SAY APPROXIMATELY

01:16:05.861 --> 01:16:09.131
$7 FOR EVERY $180 WORTH OF

01:16:09.197 --> 01:16:10.399
HYDROGEN FUEL PURCHASED. WHAT IS

01:16:10.465 --> 01:16:11.900
THAT COMPARED TO LIKE OIL, WHEN

01:16:11.967 --> 01:16:14.069
YOU'RE BUYING PUMPING GAS, IT

01:16:14.136 --> 01:16:17.105
DOESN'T EQUATE VERY WELL. IS THE

01:16:17.172 --> 01:16:19.174
IS IT'S A DIFFERENT WAY OF

01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:21.843
CALCULATING A TAX. AND THERE ARE

01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:23.445
TWO PIECES TO THE TAX, ONE THAT

01:16:23.512 --> 01:16:25.247
GOES TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND ONE

01:16:25.314 --> 01:16:26.782
THAT COMES TO THE STATE WITH A

01:16:26.848 --> 01:16:30.285
WITH A SALES AND USE TAX. ALL

01:16:30.352 --> 01:16:32.988
WE'VE DONE IS EXEMPTED THE STATE

01:16:33.055 --> 01:16:34.389
TAX AND NOT THE LOCAL

01:16:34.456 --> 01:16:36.158
GOVERNMENT. WE DIDN'T WANT TO

01:16:36.224 --> 01:16:37.626
TOUCH LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THEY

01:16:37.693 --> 01:16:39.127
NEED THE RESOURCES. AND SO WE

01:16:39.194 --> 01:16:42.397
HAVE NOT TOUCHED THAT. SO YEAH,

01:16:42.464 --> 01:16:45.567
TODAY IT'S THE EQUIVALENT

01:16:45.634 --> 01:16:48.136
TAXATION TO THE GASOLINE AND

01:16:48.203 --> 01:16:49.838
DIESEL WOULD SEE. HOWEVER WE'RE

01:16:49.905 --> 01:16:51.707
ALSO PAYING THAT REGISTRATION

01:16:51.773 --> 01:16:54.242
FEE WHICH WAS DISPLACED ON THE

01:16:54.309 --> 01:16:55.644
FOR BATTERY VEHICLES. AND SO

01:16:55.711 --> 01:16:58.680
WE'RE PICKING ONE HERE. SO YOU

01:16:58.747 --> 01:17:00.015
DOUBLE IT. SO WE DON'T KNOW. WE

01:17:00.082 --> 01:17:01.550
CAN'T GIVE I KNOW IT'S NOT

01:17:01.616 --> 01:17:03.352
APPLES TO APPLES BUT IT'S NO

01:17:03.418 --> 01:17:06.154
LIKE GENERAL IT'S ABOUT SAVINGS

01:17:06.221 --> 01:17:08.724
OR I THINK IT'S ABOUT 4%. THANK

01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:13.028
YOU. GREAT. AND SEEING NO

01:17:13.095 --> 01:17:14.796
ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS SENATOR YOU

01:17:14.863 --> 01:17:17.666

01:17:29.945 --> 01:17:33.448
FILE ITEM NUMBER FIVE, SB 587.

01:17:33.515 --> 01:17:35.417
MR. GRAYSON, THANK YOU VERY MUCH

01:17:35.484 --> 01:17:37.786
FOR YOUR PATIENCE, SIR. DO YOU

01:17:37.853 --> 01:17:39.187
HAVE ANY PRIMARY WITNESSES? THEY

01:17:39.254 --> 01:17:41.556
MAY JOIN YOU AT THE TABLE AS

01:17:41.623 --> 01:17:43.959
WELL, AND YOU MAY START WHEN

01:17:44.026 --> 01:17:47.229
READY. THANK YOU SO MUCH, MR.

01:17:47.295 --> 01:17:48.563
CHAIR. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE,

01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:51.066
SB 587 SEEKS TO INCENTIVIZE LONG

01:17:51.133 --> 01:17:52.601
TERM INVESTMENTS IN FUEL

01:17:52.667 --> 01:17:54.636
EXPANSION IN CALIFORNIA'S

01:17:54.703 --> 01:17:55.871
MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY BY

01:17:55.937 --> 01:17:57.572
PROVIDING A STATE TAX CREDIT FOR

01:17:57.639 --> 01:17:59.775
THE LOCAL SALES TAX PAID BY

01:17:59.841 --> 01:18:01.610
MANUFACTURERS FOR QUALIFIED

01:18:01.676 --> 01:18:03.745
EQUIPMENT PURCHASES. THIS WILL

01:18:03.812 --> 01:18:04.813
FACILITATE THE GROWTH, HIRING

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:06.615
AND TRAINING OF SKILLED

01:18:06.681 --> 01:18:08.016
WORKFORCES FOR THE FUTURE AND

01:18:08.083 --> 01:18:09.985
PROVIDE HIGH WAGE JOBS FOR

01:18:10.052 --> 01:18:11.253
CALIFORNIANS UP AND DOWN THE

01:18:11.319 --> 01:18:13.855
STATE. PRE-PANDEMIC, OUR STATE'S

01:18:13.922 --> 01:18:15.123
MANUFACTURING SECTOR HAD ALREADY

01:18:15.190 --> 01:18:17.726
FACED A DECLINE IN TOTAL

01:18:17.793 --> 01:18:19.428
EMPLOYMENT, WITH MUCH OF THIS

01:18:19.494 --> 01:18:21.063
DECLINE BEING A RESULT OF

01:18:21.129 --> 01:18:22.531
CALIFORNIA'S STEEP COST OF DOING

01:18:22.597 --> 01:18:24.699
BUSINESS, WHICH IS ONE OF THE

01:18:24.766 --> 01:18:26.034
HIGHEST IN THE NATION. THE COVID

01:18:26.101 --> 01:18:28.203
19 PANDEMIC FURTHER CHALLENGED

01:18:28.270 --> 01:18:29.371
CALIFORNIA'S MANUFACTURING

01:18:29.438 --> 01:18:31.339
SECTOR, AND THE SECTOR IS STILL

01:18:31.406 --> 01:18:33.208
RECOVERING, TRYING TO REGAIN A

01:18:33.275 --> 01:18:35.877
FOOTHOLD IN A STATE OR IN OUR

01:18:35.944 --> 01:18:37.813
STATE ONCE AGAIN. UNFORTUNATELY,

01:18:37.879 --> 01:18:39.414
CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO ATTRACT

01:18:39.481 --> 01:18:40.849
LESS OF THE COUNTRY'S

01:18:40.916 --> 01:18:42.250
MANUFACTURING INVESTMENTS, WITH

01:18:42.317 --> 01:18:43.852
OTHER STATES AGGRESSIVELY

01:18:43.919 --> 01:18:45.754
ATTEMPTING TO LURE OUR STATE'S

01:18:45.821 --> 01:18:46.888
MANUFACTURERS WITH ATTRACTIVE

01:18:46.955 --> 01:18:49.091
LOWER BUSINESS COSTS AND

01:18:49.157 --> 01:18:51.026
LOCATION INCENTIVES. ACCORDING

01:18:51.093 --> 01:18:53.028
TO THE 2024 CALIFORNIA JOBS

01:18:53.095 --> 01:18:55.130
MARKET BRIEFING PUBLISHED BY THE

01:18:55.197 --> 01:18:56.264
EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT

01:18:56.331 --> 01:18:57.666
DEPARTMENT, THE MANUFACTURING

01:18:57.732 --> 01:19:00.569
SECTOR WAS ONE OF ONLY THREE

01:19:00.635 --> 01:19:02.404
INDUSTRIES THAT EXPERIENCED JOB

01:19:02.471 --> 01:19:04.172
LOSS DURING THE MOST RECENT

01:19:04.239 --> 01:19:06.108
REPORTING PERIOD. AS A MATTER OF

01:19:06.174 --> 01:19:08.243
FACT, EVEN MORE NOTABLE AND

01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:09.444
ALARMING ABOUT THIS INFORMATION

01:19:09.511 --> 01:19:11.680
FROM OUR EDD IS THAT

01:19:11.746 --> 01:19:13.482
MANUFACTURING IS ONE OF THE FEW

01:19:13.548 --> 01:19:15.317
SECTORS TO HAVE EXPERIENCED

01:19:15.383 --> 01:19:17.486
CONSECUTIVE YEAR OVER YEAR JOB

01:19:17.552 --> 01:19:18.987
LOSSES, SOMETHING THAT SHOULD

01:19:19.054 --> 01:19:22.224
GIVE ALL OF US PAUSE AS POLICY

01:19:22.290 --> 01:19:23.992
MAKERS. IN FACT, THERE ARE

01:19:24.059 --> 01:19:26.228
APPROXIMATELY 80,000

01:19:26.294 --> 01:19:28.697
MANUFACTURING JOBS IN CALIFORNIA

01:19:28.763 --> 01:19:30.665
NOW THAN THERE WAS IN SEPTEMBER

01:19:30.732 --> 01:19:33.335
OF 2022, ACCORDING TO THE LATEST

01:19:33.401 --> 01:19:37.739
DATA. WE MUST DO BETTER. SB 587

01:19:37.806 --> 01:19:39.274
WILL HELP TO REVERSE THESE

01:19:39.341 --> 01:19:40.542
TRENDS AND MAKE CALIFORNIA MORE

01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:42.377
ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTMENT FROM

01:19:42.444 --> 01:19:43.778
FOREIGN MANUFACTURERS,

01:19:43.845 --> 01:19:45.080
ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE FACT

01:19:45.147 --> 01:19:48.049
THAT 38 STATES ALREADY HAVE A

01:19:48.116 --> 01:19:51.286
FULL SALES AND USE TAX EXEMPTION

01:19:51.353 --> 01:19:52.687
FOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT

01:19:52.754 --> 01:19:55.090
PURCHASES, AND ANOTHER FIVE

01:19:55.157 --> 01:19:57.459
STATES HAVE NO SALES TAX AT ALL,

01:19:57.526 --> 01:19:59.361
IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE STATE

01:19:59.427 --> 01:20:01.396
FIND WAYS TO MITIGATE FINANCIAL

01:20:01.463 --> 01:20:03.565
BURDENS, PROMOTE INCREASED

01:20:03.632 --> 01:20:04.633
PRODUCTION, AND ENSURE THE

01:20:04.699 --> 01:20:06.902
GROWTH OF HIGH WAGE JOBS FOR A

01:20:06.968 --> 01:20:09.004
VARIETY OF SKILL LEVELS AND

01:20:09.070 --> 01:20:10.505
BACKGROUNDS. IN ONE OF THE

01:20:10.572 --> 01:20:12.674
STATE'S ESSENTIAL INDUSTRIES. A

01:20:12.741 --> 01:20:15.076
STATE, OR SHALL I SAY, STOUT

01:20:15.143 --> 01:20:17.279
MANUFACTURING JOB BASE IS KEY TO

01:20:17.345 --> 01:20:19.281
THE GLOBAL AND DOMESTIC

01:20:19.347 --> 01:20:20.949
COMPETITIVENESS OF OUR ECONOMY

01:20:21.016 --> 01:20:22.284
BECAUSE OF ITS BREADTH AND

01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:24.486
BECAUSE OF ITS VARIETY. THERE IS

01:20:24.553 --> 01:20:26.054
A MISCONCEPTION THAT ALL

01:20:26.121 --> 01:20:27.322
MANUFACTURING IS DONE ON LARGE

01:20:27.389 --> 01:20:29.624
INDUSTRIAL SCALES, BUT OVER 70%

01:20:29.691 --> 01:20:31.626
OF MANUFACTURERS HAVE LESS THAN

01:20:31.693 --> 01:20:33.762
20 EMPLOYEES. SMALL AND MEDIUM

01:20:33.828 --> 01:20:36.665
SIZED MANUFACTURERS FACE A

01:20:36.731 --> 01:20:38.033
DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF

01:20:38.099 --> 01:20:39.668
ECONOMIC BURDENS, INCREASED

01:20:39.734 --> 01:20:41.670
CAPITAL COSTS DUE TO SUPPLY

01:20:41.736 --> 01:20:42.871
CHAIN ISSUES, AND ONE OF THE

01:20:42.938 --> 01:20:44.773
HIGHEST STATE AND LOCAL SALES

01:20:44.839 --> 01:20:46.808
TAX RATES IN THE NATION. THIS

01:20:46.875 --> 01:20:48.143
MEASURE WOULD HELP TO EASE SOME

01:20:48.210 --> 01:20:50.412
OF THOSE ECONOMIC BURDENS, AND

01:20:50.478 --> 01:20:52.581
CALIFORNIA HAS COMPARATIVE

01:20:52.647 --> 01:20:53.982
MANUFACTURING ADVANTAGES TO

01:20:54.049 --> 01:20:56.218
OTHER REGIONS OF THE WORLD DUE

01:20:56.284 --> 01:20:58.620
TO THE STRENGTH AND DEPTH OF ITS

01:20:58.687 --> 01:20:59.387
INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY. NOT

01:20:59.454 --> 01:21:01.523
ONLY DOES THE INDUSTRY EMPLOY

01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:02.691
1.2 MILLION PEOPLE IN

01:21:02.757 --> 01:21:04.426
CALIFORNIA, BUT IT ALSO PLAYS A

01:21:04.492 --> 01:21:06.595
KEY ROLE IN CREATING NEW JOBS,

01:21:06.661 --> 01:21:08.530
WITH ITS MULTIPLIER EFFECT

01:21:08.597 --> 01:21:11.233
SUPPORTING 2.5 JOBS FOR EVERY

01:21:11.299 --> 01:21:12.734
ONE MANUFACTURING JOB.

01:21:12.801 --> 01:21:13.935
MANUFACTURING PLAYS A CRUCIAL

01:21:14.002 --> 01:21:15.704
AND ESSENTIAL ROLE WITHIN OUR

01:21:15.770 --> 01:21:17.439
STATE'S ECONOMY, SUPPORTING HIGH

01:21:17.505 --> 01:21:19.641
WAGE JOBS AND SMALL BUSINESSES

01:21:19.708 --> 01:21:22.444
WITH ROOM FOR GROWTH. AS I COME

01:21:22.510 --> 01:21:26.414
NEAR TO MY CLOSE, IT IS MY HOPE

01:21:26.481 --> 01:21:28.483
THAT THIS LEGISLATION CAN BE A

01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:31.519
TIPPING POINT TO ENCOURAGE A NEW

01:21:31.586 --> 01:21:34.322

COMPANIES TO PLANT ROOTS IN OUR

01:21:37.659 --> 01:21:39.361
STATE AND GROW, WHICH WILL ALLOW

01:21:39.427 --> 01:21:41.630
ALL OF US TO REAP THE REWARDS OF

01:21:41.696 --> 01:21:43.798
THE HARVEST, WE HAVE A CHANCE TO

01:21:47.002 --> 01:21:48.603
KNOWN OPPOSITION. I RESPECTFULLY

01:21:48.670 --> 01:21:50.472
ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AT THE

01:21:50.538 --> 01:21:52.841

CALIFORNIA MEMBERS, SO I WILL

01:24:01.536 --> 01:24:03.204
TRY AND BUILD THAT IN A LITTLE

01:24:03.271 --> 01:24:04.672
BIT. THIS IS, I THINK,

01:24:04.739 --> 01:24:06.141
SOMETHING. AND, YOU KNOW, THE

01:24:14.048 --> 01:24:15.350
STRONG MESSAGE THAT CALIFORNIA

01:24:15.417 --> 01:24:16.217
IS SERIOUS ABOUT RETAINING AND

01:24:16.284 --> 01:24:17.385
GROWING ITS MANUFACTURING BASE.

01:24:17.452 --> 01:24:18.620
BAY AREA MANUFACTURERS REPORT

01:24:18.686 --> 01:24:20.321
THAT WITHOUT THIS KIND OF

01:24:20.388 --> 01:24:21.389
EXEMPTION, THEY ARE DELAYING OR

01:24:21.456 --> 01:24:23.224
SCALING BACK INVESTMENTS IN NEW

01:24:23.291 --> 01:24:24.125
PRODUCTION LINES OR MOVING THEM

01:24:24.192 --> 01:24:25.894
OUT OF THE STATE ALTOGETHER.

01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:26.995
NOW, SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REMAINS

01:24:27.061 --> 01:24:28.263
ONE OF THE LARGEST MANUFACTURING

01:24:28.329 --> 01:24:29.931
CENTERS, BUT THAT TAX BASE HAS

01:24:29.998 --> 01:24:31.699
ERODED DUE TO OUTDATED

01:24:31.766 --> 01:24:32.600
INFRASTRUCTURE, HIGH OPERATING

01:24:32.667 --> 01:24:34.302
COSTS AND LIMITED SUPPORT FOR

01:24:34.369 --> 01:24:36.471
MODERNIZED FACILITIES. I WOULD

01:24:36.538 --> 01:24:38.173
NOTE WE'VE TAKEN RECENT ACTION

01:24:38.239 --> 01:24:41.609
IN THE BUDGET FOR ADVANCED

01:24:41.676 --> 01:24:42.410
MANUFACTURING. I THINK THAT'S

01:24:42.477 --> 01:24:43.411
REALLY CRITICAL BECAUSE COUPLED

01:24:43.478 --> 01:24:44.946
WITH THIS TAX CREDIT, WE HAVE

01:24:45.013 --> 01:24:46.648
THE OPPORTUNITY AGAIN TO STATE

01:24:46.714 --> 01:24:48.049
THE SERIOUSNESS OF OUR DESIRE TO

01:24:48.116 --> 01:24:49.184
RETAIN AND GROW THE

01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:51.252
MANUFACTURING BASE HERE. WE NOW

01:24:51.319 --> 01:24:53.121
HAVE OFFERED SOME VERY TARGETED

01:24:53.188 --> 01:24:54.656
REGULATORY RELIEF. WE NOW COUPLE

01:24:54.722 --> 01:24:56.257
THAT WITH SOME RESOURCES TO BE

01:24:56.324 --> 01:24:58.059
ABLE TO HAVE CAPITAL TO ADDRESS

01:24:58.126 --> 01:25:00.094
THOSE HIGH OPERATING COSTS. SO

01:25:00.161 --> 01:25:01.996
BY REDUCING THOSE COSTS OF

01:25:02.063 --> 01:25:03.698
CAPITAL INTENSIVE CLEAN TECH

01:25:03.765 --> 01:25:04.532
INVESTMENTS, THIS BILL CAN

01:25:04.599 --> 01:25:06.734
DIRECTLY ACCELERATE CALIFORNIA'S

01:25:06.801 --> 01:25:07.635
ZERO EMISSIONS AND CIRCULAR

01:25:07.702 --> 01:25:09.270
ECONOMY OBJECTIVES. IT'S

01:25:09.337 --> 01:25:10.338
STRUCTURED TO INCLUDE

01:25:10.405 --> 01:25:11.506
APPROPRIATE SAFEGUARDS, MODEST

01:25:11.573 --> 01:25:12.841
IN SCOPE, AGAIN COMPARED TO

01:25:12.907 --> 01:25:14.576
OTHER TAX ADVANTAGES IN OTHER

01:25:14.642 --> 01:25:16.511

COMMITTEE, MR. QUIRK-SILVA. I

01:26:03.725 --> 01:26:05.026
WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR

01:26:05.093 --> 01:26:06.394
BRINGING THIS FORWARD. YOU KNOW,

01:26:06.461 --> 01:26:08.162
ONCE YOU SPEND ENOUGH TIME HERE

01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:09.731
AT THE LEGISLATIVE BODY, YOU

01:26:09.797 --> 01:26:13.735
START TO IDENTIFY CERTAIN

01:26:13.801 --> 01:26:15.503
CERTAIN AUTHORS WITH CERTAIN

01:26:15.570 --> 01:26:16.905
TYPES OF LEGISLATION. AND YOU

01:26:16.971 --> 01:26:18.940
CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN A CHAMPION

01:26:19.007 --> 01:26:21.609
ON MANUAL MANUFACTURING, ALONG

01:26:21.676 --> 01:26:26.147
WITH OUR CHAIR HERE. AND WHEN WE

01:26:26.214 --> 01:26:29.617
TALK ABOUT THE SUPPORT FOR

01:26:29.684 --> 01:26:30.218
MANUFACTURING, WE JUST MOVED

01:26:30.285 --> 01:26:32.053
THROUGH A BUDGET SESSION WHERE

01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:35.189
WE KNOW WE CAN DO BIG THINGS

01:26:35.256 --> 01:26:37.825
WHEN THERE'S THE SUPPORT FOR IT.

01:26:37.892 --> 01:26:39.527
AND WE CERTAINLY LIFTED A BIG

01:26:39.594 --> 01:26:41.396
TAX CREDIT WITH THE FILM TAX

01:26:41.462 --> 01:26:44.566
CREDIT. AND YET WE WERE A LITTLE

01:26:44.632 --> 01:26:46.267
SILENT ON THIS MANUFACTURING.

01:26:46.334 --> 01:26:48.570
AND WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO TAKE

01:26:48.636 --> 01:26:51.172
THIS SERIOUS, BECAUSE IF WE ARE

01:26:51.239 --> 01:26:52.273
GOING TO UPLIFT CALIFORNIA IN

01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:54.208
THE WAY IT NEEDS TO BE AND LOOK

01:26:54.275 --> 01:26:55.877
TOWARDS THE FUTURE, WE CANNOT

01:26:55.944 --> 01:26:58.012
IGNORE THIS. I HAD AN

01:26:58.079 --> 01:26:59.447
OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT JUST RIGHT

01:26:59.514 --> 01:27:02.183
IN MY OWN CITY, FULLERTON. THE

01:27:02.250 --> 01:27:04.519
FULLERTON FOAM FACTORY JUST

01:27:04.586 --> 01:27:06.988
ABOUT A MONTH AGO, AND THEY MAKE

01:27:07.055 --> 01:27:10.224
ALL OF THE MATTRESSES AND

01:27:10.291 --> 01:27:11.859
ACTUALLY THE CUSHION UNDERNEATH

01:27:11.926 --> 01:27:14.195
THE FLOORING. SO WHO WOULD THINK

01:27:14.262 --> 01:27:17.031
HERE IN FULLERTON AND HAD A VERY

01:27:17.098 --> 01:27:20.001
LARGE MANUFACTURING AND THEY DO

01:27:20.068 --> 01:27:23.037
USE A LOT OF RECYCLED FOAM IN

01:27:23.104 --> 01:27:24.505
ADDITION ALL THE CUTOUTS. SO I

01:27:24.572 --> 01:27:26.174
WANT YOU AND THE AUDIENCE TO

01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:27.275
THINK ABOUT IF YOU'RE WEARING

01:27:27.342 --> 01:27:28.876
TENNIS SHOES, ALL THE FOAM IN

01:27:28.943 --> 01:27:30.378
YOUR SHOES, WHICH WE DON'T EVEN

01:27:30.445 --> 01:27:32.714
THINK ABOUT THESE EVERY DAY

01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:34.382
PRODUCTS WHERE THEY USE THE

01:27:34.449 --> 01:27:36.150
CUTOUTS. SO IF YOU MAKE THE NIKE

01:27:36.217 --> 01:27:37.919
TENNIS SHOES, ALL OF THAT

01:27:37.986 --> 01:27:39.687
LEFTOVER FOAM HAS TO GO

01:27:39.754 --> 01:27:41.889
SOMEWHERE. THEY RECYCLE IT AND

01:27:41.956 --> 01:27:45.059
THEY PUT IT BACK INTO USE AS

01:27:45.126 --> 01:27:47.629
EITHER ON THE FLOOR OR IN SOME

01:27:47.695 --> 01:27:49.998
CASES, MATTRESSES. AND YET THEY

01:27:50.064 --> 01:27:51.866
TALK BROUGHT ME IN. AND BECAUSE

01:27:51.933 --> 01:27:55.303
THEY SAID THAT THEY HAD NINE

01:27:55.370 --> 01:27:56.938
MANUFACTURING IN CALIFORNIA

01:27:57.005 --> 01:27:58.206
THROUGHOUT THE STATE, AND NOW

01:27:58.272 --> 01:28:00.608
THEY'RE DOWN TO THREE. SO THIS

01:28:00.675 --> 01:28:03.144
IS SERIOUS. AND WE AS

01:28:03.211 --> 01:28:05.980
LEGISLATORS KNOW THAT WE CAN

01:28:06.047 --> 01:28:07.782
SPEAK WITH ONE VOICE, AND YET

01:28:07.849 --> 01:28:09.017
WE'RE NOT ALWAYS DOING IT IN

01:28:09.083 --> 01:28:11.452
THIS SPACE. IF WE WANT THOSE

01:28:11.519 --> 01:28:14.889
JOBS, IF WE WANT THIS REVENUE

01:28:14.956 --> 01:28:17.158
THAT WE ARE GOING TO LOSE AS WE

01:28:17.225 --> 01:28:18.292
DID WITH HOLLYWOOD, THEN WE

01:28:18.359 --> 01:28:21.462
BETTER GET SERIOUS FAST. SO WITH

01:28:21.529 --> 01:28:25.500
THAT, I SUPPORT IT. THANK YOU

01:28:25.566 --> 01:28:28.569
VERY MUCH, MISS MCKENNA. YES,

01:28:28.636 --> 01:28:30.004
SENATOR GRAYSON, I JUST WANTED

01:28:30.071 --> 01:28:32.240
TO SAY WE MISS YOU OVER HERE IN

01:28:32.306 --> 01:28:33.241
THE ASSEMBLY. I WANTED TO START

01:28:33.307 --> 01:28:35.076
WITH THAT. WE MISS YOU THIS

01:28:35.143 --> 01:28:36.878
YEAR. BUT I ALSO THANK YOU FOR

01:28:36.944 --> 01:28:38.446
THIS BILL. WE KNOW THAT

01:28:38.513 --> 01:28:39.580
MANUFACTURING JOBS IS OUR MIDDLE

01:28:39.647 --> 01:28:41.215
OUR MIDDLE CLASS JOBS. THEY HELP

01:28:41.282 --> 01:28:42.417
PEOPLE BUY A HOME, SEND THEIR

01:28:42.483 --> 01:28:44.352
KIDS TO COLLEGE AND LIVE THE

01:28:44.419 --> 01:28:45.987
AMERICAN DREAM, TAKE VACATIONS,

01:28:46.054 --> 01:28:47.889
AND DO ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE

01:28:47.955 --> 01:28:49.190
THAT OUR FAMILIES WOULD LIKE TO

01:28:49.257 --> 01:28:52.393
DO. AND SO I COMMEND YOU FOR

01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:53.928
TAKING UP THIS BILL. AND WE I

01:28:53.995 --> 01:28:55.997
KNOW IT'S IT CHARGES THE BUDGET,

01:28:56.064 --> 01:28:57.598
BUT THIS IS AN INVESTMENT AND WE

01:28:57.665 --> 01:28:59.300
GET THE MONEY BACK DOUBLE. AND

01:28:59.367 --> 01:29:00.802
SO JUST LIKE MY COLLEAGUE SAID,

01:29:00.868 --> 01:29:02.570
WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT

01:29:02.637 --> 01:29:03.371
MANUFACTURING AS WE THOUGHT

01:29:03.438 --> 01:29:05.573
ABOUT THE FILM TAX CREDIT. AND

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:07.875
WITH THAT I'LL BE VOTING YES ON

01:29:07.942 --> 01:29:10.311
THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

01:29:10.378 --> 01:29:12.146
TO THE SENATOR. I KNOW THIS IS

01:29:12.213 --> 01:29:13.948
NOT THE FIRST TIME THIS BILL.

01:29:14.015 --> 01:29:16.017
THIS IS THE SECOND TIME. WHAT

01:29:16.084 --> 01:29:18.720
ARE YOU GOING TO DO DIFFERENT

01:29:18.786 --> 01:29:20.188
AND ALSO HAVE CONVERSATIONS

01:29:20.254 --> 01:29:21.522
TAKING PLACE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S

01:29:21.589 --> 01:29:24.092
OFFICE THAT YOU CAN ELABORATE ON

01:29:24.158 --> 01:29:26.694
TO TRY TO MOVE AND, YOU KNOW,

01:29:26.761 --> 01:29:28.463
GET THIS BILL ACROSS THE FINISH

01:29:28.529 --> 01:29:29.897
LINE. YES. THANK YOU SO VERY

01:29:29.964 --> 01:29:32.767
MUCH. WE ARE IN AND HAVE HAD

01:29:32.834 --> 01:29:33.901
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

01:29:33.968 --> 01:29:35.570
ADMINISTRATION. WE DO RECOGNIZE

01:29:35.636 --> 01:29:37.238
THAT THERE IS SOMETHING SIMILAR

01:29:37.305 --> 01:29:39.273
THAT ALREADY EXISTS THROUGH

01:29:39.340 --> 01:29:42.477
GO-BIZ, DEPARTMENTALLY, AS WELL

01:29:42.543 --> 01:29:44.979
AS PROGRAMMATIC. HOWEVER, IT

01:29:45.046 --> 01:29:48.549
DOESN'T PROVIDE THE FULL BENEFIT

01:29:48.616 --> 01:29:50.451
THAT THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE. SO

01:29:50.518 --> 01:29:51.853
THIS BILL WOULD ENHANCE WHAT

01:29:51.919 --> 01:29:53.621
ALREADY EXISTED BECOME A PART

01:29:53.688 --> 01:29:56.257
OF. SO INSTEAD OF TRYING TO

01:29:56.324 --> 01:29:57.225
CREATE AND REINVENT THE WHEEL,

01:29:57.291 --> 01:29:58.192
WHAT WE'RE TAKING, WHAT WE'RE

01:29:58.259 --> 01:30:00.561
TAKING IS WHAT ALREADY EXISTS

01:30:00.628 --> 01:30:02.497
AND MAKING IT BETTER AND MAKING

01:30:02.563 --> 01:30:04.132
IT MORE COMPETITIVE. THE WAY IT

01:30:04.198 --> 01:30:05.833
EXISTS RIGHT NOW, IT REALLY

01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:07.635
DOESN'T ELEVATE CALIFORNIA INTO

01:30:07.702 --> 01:30:09.904
A COMPETITIVE FIELD WITH THE

01:30:09.971 --> 01:30:12.373
WITH THE 38 OTHER STATES, PLUS

01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:14.475
THE FIVE THAT DON'T EVEN HAVE A

01:30:14.542 --> 01:30:18.179
TAX ON A SALES TAX. SO WHAT

01:30:18.246 --> 01:30:19.547
WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO DO IS

01:30:19.614 --> 01:30:21.415
TAKE WHAT WE HAVE, ENHANCE IT,

01:30:21.482 --> 01:30:23.885
MAKE IT BIGGER, BETTER, AND AT

01:30:23.951 --> 01:30:25.987
LEAST PUT US ON A LEVEL PLAYING

01:30:26.053 --> 01:30:27.121
FIELD AND HOPEFULLY WITH

01:30:27.188 --> 01:30:28.923
EVERYTHING ELSE CALIFORNIA HAS

01:30:28.990 --> 01:30:31.025
TO OFFER, IT MAKES IT BETTER AND

01:30:31.092 --> 01:30:32.593
WE BECOME MORE ATTRACTIVE. SO

01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:35.329
WITH THAT, WE'RE GOING FULL ON

01:30:35.396 --> 01:30:37.031
GUSTO. THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT

01:30:37.098 --> 01:30:38.299
COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES ON

01:30:38.366 --> 01:30:39.700
THE COMMITTEE HERE ABOUT THE

01:30:39.767 --> 01:30:41.869
FACT THAT IT MAY BE WHAT WE SEE

01:30:41.936 --> 01:30:44.372
A COST UP FRONT, BUT IT IS TRULY

01:30:44.438 --> 01:30:47.341
AN INVESTMENT THAT HAS A RETURN

01:30:47.408 --> 01:30:50.411
THAT IS MEASURABLY EXPONENTIAL.

01:30:50.478 --> 01:30:51.946
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WITH THAT,

01:30:52.013 --> 01:30:55.850
YOU MAY CLOSE. OH, THAT WAS THAT

01:30:55.917 --> 01:30:57.952
WAS PRETTY CLOSE TO MY CLOSE.

01:30:58.019 --> 01:31:00.188
THANK YOU, CHAIR, FOR HEARING US

01:31:00.254 --> 01:31:02.790
OUT AND FOR THE VERY KIND

01:31:02.857 --> 01:31:04.392
COMMENTS. I DO MISS THE ASSEMBLY

01:31:04.458 --> 01:31:06.294
AS WELL HAVING FUN ON THE RED

01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:08.162
SIDE, BUT I DO MISS YOU ALL OVER

01:31:08.229 --> 01:31:09.964
HERE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN

01:31:10.031 --> 01:31:11.566
AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE

01:31:11.632 --> 01:31:12.834
TIME. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH AND

01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:15.236
THANK YOU TO STAFF. THANK YOU TO

YOU, COMMITTEE MEMBERS. IT'S

01:31:55.209 --> 01:31:57.411
NICE TO BE WITH YOU HERE TODAY.

01:31:57.478 --> 01:31:59.580
I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE

01:31:59.647 --> 01:32:02.483
AMENDMENTS ON SB 710 THAT

01:32:02.550 --> 01:32:04.285
INCLUDE A FIVE YEAR SUNSET ON

01:32:04.352 --> 01:32:06.787
THIS TAX EXCLUSION IN ACCORDANCE

01:32:06.854 --> 01:32:08.723
WITH THE COMMITTEE'S POLICY. AND

01:32:08.789 --> 01:32:10.391
I WANT TO THANK THE STAFF FOR

01:32:10.458 --> 01:32:12.827
THEIR WORK. IT'S MORE IMPORTANT

01:32:12.894 --> 01:32:14.729
THAN EVER THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:32:14.795 --> 01:32:15.796
PRIORITIZE AFFORDABILITY

01:32:15.863 --> 01:32:17.632
MEASURES FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS.

01:32:17.698 --> 01:32:20.201
SB 710 IS ONE OPPORTUNITY TO DO

01:32:20.268 --> 01:32:23.037
THAT. SB 710 RENEWS AN IMPORTANT

01:32:23.104 --> 01:32:24.438
TAX INCENTIVE FOR HOMEOWNERS AND

01:32:24.505 --> 01:32:26.574
SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS TO INSTALL

01:32:26.641 --> 01:32:28.409
SOLAR PANELS, WHICH IS CRITICAL

01:32:28.476 --> 01:32:29.810
AS THE STATE WORKS TO INCREASE

01:32:29.877 --> 01:32:31.212
GREEN ENERGY PRODUCTION, MEET

01:32:31.279 --> 01:32:32.980
ITS CLIMATE GOALS, AND

01:32:33.047 --> 01:32:34.482
PRIORITIZE AFFORDABILITY

01:32:34.548 --> 01:32:37.084
POLICIES FOR CALIFORNIANS. TO

01:32:37.151 --> 01:32:38.152
ILLUSTRATE THE ISSUE, THE TOTAL

01:32:38.219 --> 01:32:40.288
COST TO INSTALL INSTALL A

01:32:40.354 --> 01:32:41.289
RESIDENTIAL SOLAR PANEL AND

01:32:41.355 --> 01:32:43.824
STORAGE SYSTEM IN 2025 IS IN THE

01:32:43.891 --> 01:32:46.060
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.

01:32:46.127 --> 01:32:47.128
THIS INCENTIVE, WHICH ONLY

01:32:47.194 --> 01:32:48.696
APPLIES TO THE FIRST INSTALLER

01:32:48.763 --> 01:32:50.364
OF A SOLAR PANEL SYSTEM,

01:32:50.431 --> 01:32:51.799
PREVENTS THE COST OF THE SYSTEM

01:32:51.866 --> 01:32:53.200
FROM BEING ADDED TO THE VALUE OF

01:32:53.267 --> 01:32:55.503
YOUR HOME FOR THE PURPOSES OF

01:32:55.569 --> 01:32:59.440
PROPERTY TAXES, SAVING RESIDENTS

01:32:59.507 --> 01:33:00.741
BETWEEN 2 AND $500 PER YEAR. IF

01:33:00.808 --> 01:33:02.209
WE DON'T GET THIS ONE ACROSS THE

01:33:02.276 --> 01:33:04.078
FINISH LINE AND SIGNED BY THE

01:33:04.145 --> 01:33:04.879
GOVERNOR, THE CURRENT TAX

01:33:04.946 --> 01:33:06.247
EXCLUSION FOR SOLAR THAT HAS

01:33:06.314 --> 01:33:08.316
EXISTED FOR OVER 25 YEARS WILL

01:33:08.382 --> 01:33:11.485
EXPIRE AT THE END OF 2026. IT'S

01:33:11.552 --> 01:33:13.120
CRUCIAL TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO

01:33:13.187 --> 01:33:14.422
SWITCH TO SOLAR THAT WE KEEP

01:33:14.488 --> 01:33:18.793
THIS PROPERTY TAX EXCLUSION DUE

01:33:18.859 --> 01:33:20.027
TO REDUCED RATES THAT HOMEOWNERS

01:33:20.094 --> 01:33:21.562
NOW RECEIVE FOR PROVIDING SOLAR

01:33:21.629 --> 01:33:23.497
ENERGY TO THE GRID. SOLAR

01:33:23.564 --> 01:33:25.666
ADOPTION RATES HAVE PLUMMETED.

01:33:25.733 --> 01:33:27.101
TAKING AWAY THIS PROPERTY TAX

01:33:27.168 --> 01:33:28.536
EXCLUSION WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY

01:33:28.602 --> 01:33:30.271
REDUCE SOLAR ADOPTION EVEN

01:33:30.338 --> 01:33:31.639
FURTHER. CALIFORNIA MADE A

01:33:31.706 --> 01:33:33.274
COMMITMENT TO ACHIEVE 100%

01:33:33.341 --> 01:33:35.710
CARBON FREE ELECTRICITY BY 2045,

01:33:35.776 --> 01:33:37.144
BUT WE ARE STRUGGLING TO STAY ON

01:33:37.211 --> 01:33:39.280
TRACK TO MEET THAT GOAL. WE NEED

01:33:39.347 --> 01:33:40.348
THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT OF CLEAN

01:33:40.414 --> 01:33:42.283
ENERGY GENERATION AND EIGHT

01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:44.151
TIMES THE AMOUNT OF STORAGE

01:33:44.218 --> 01:33:45.086
COMPARED TO WHAT WE CURRENTLY

01:33:45.152 --> 01:33:46.087
HAVE, ACCORDING TO A JOINT

01:33:46.153 --> 01:33:48.356
REPORT LED BY THE CALIFORNIA

01:33:48.422 --> 01:33:49.323
ENERGY COMMISSION, IT WILL

01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:50.491
EXTEND THE SUNSET ON THE

01:33:50.558 --> 01:33:51.892
PROPERTY TAX EXCLUSION FOR

01:33:51.959 --> 01:33:53.694
ACTIVE SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS AND

01:33:53.761 --> 01:33:54.695
ESTABLISH A NEW LIMITED

01:33:54.762 --> 01:33:56.831
EXCLUSION FOR SYSTEMS INSTALLED

01:33:56.897 --> 01:33:59.867
ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1ST, 2026.

01:33:59.934 --> 01:34:01.202
SPECIFICALLY, SB 710 WILL

01:34:01.268 --> 01:34:02.603
PROVIDE EXCLUSIONS FOR SYSTEMS

01:34:02.670 --> 01:34:04.171
INCLUDING RESIDENTIAL

01:34:04.238 --> 01:34:05.639
PROPERTIES, SMALL COMMERCIAL

01:34:05.706 --> 01:34:07.375
SYSTEMS, AND LARGER COMMERCIAL

01:34:07.441 --> 01:34:09.210
SYSTEMS ENROLLED IN NET ENERGY

01:34:09.276 --> 01:34:10.611
METERING. HOWEVER, THIS

01:34:10.678 --> 01:34:11.746
EXCLUSION DOES NOT APPLY TO

01:34:11.812 --> 01:34:13.948
COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS OVER FIVE

01:34:14.015 --> 01:34:15.616
MEGAWATTS, PREVENTING LARGE

01:34:15.683 --> 01:34:16.817
UTILITY SCALE OPERATORS FROM

01:34:16.884 --> 01:34:19.620
CLAIMING THESE BENEFITS. SB 710

01:34:19.687 --> 01:34:21.322
BALANCES THE NEED TO CONTINUE

01:34:21.389 --> 01:34:22.857
ENCOURAGING SOLAR ADOPTION, WITH

01:34:22.923 --> 01:34:24.658
THE NEED FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:34:24.725 --> 01:34:26.460
TO HAVE PROPERTY TAX REVENUE.

01:34:26.527 --> 01:34:28.662
NOW MORE THAN EVER, WE MUST

01:34:28.729 --> 01:34:29.263
MAINTAIN THIS INCENTIVE THAT

01:34:29.330 --> 01:34:30.765
MAKES THE SOLAR TRANSITION MORE

01:34:30.831 --> 01:34:32.166
AFFORDABLE FOR INDIVIDUALS,

01:34:32.233 --> 01:34:33.734
BUSINESSES, SCHOOLS AND OTHERS.

01:34:33.801 --> 01:34:35.136
AND TO HELP THE STATE MEET ITS

01:34:35.202 --> 01:34:37.171
CLEAN ENERGY GOALS. AND WITH ME

01:34:37.238 --> 01:34:38.672
TODAY, I HAVE LAURA DEHAAN, ON

01:34:38.739 --> 01:34:40.508

AND OBVIOUSLY CALIFORNIA HAS

01:35:05.733 --> 01:35:08.602
BEEN A LEADER NATIONALLY ON

01:35:08.669 --> 01:35:10.438
INSTALLING SOLAR AND OTHER CLEAN

01:35:10.504 --> 01:35:12.973
ENERGY. WE NOW HAVE MORE SOLAR

01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:15.443
THAN ANY OTHER STATE BY FAR, AND

01:35:15.509 --> 01:35:16.944
ONE WAY THAT WE'VE HELPED TO

01:35:17.011 --> 01:35:19.847
LEAD THE WAY ON THAT IS WITH TAX

01:35:19.914 --> 01:35:21.749

PUNISHED OR PENALIZED FOR

01:35:44.438 --> 01:35:45.272

AS WELL. PIPELINES. SO LARGE

01:38:17.925 --> 01:38:19.159
ENERGY CONSUMERS. ONE THING THEY

01:38:19.226 --> 01:38:21.228

01:38:21.295 --> 01:38:22.830
OF THE BASE INTERRUPTIBLE

01:38:22.896 --> 01:38:24.064
PROGRAM. SO AT ANY MOMENT THE

01:38:24.131 --> 01:38:26.567
STATE CALLS ON US AND WE HAVE TO

01:38:26.634 --> 01:38:27.201
REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY

01:38:27.268 --> 01:38:29.370

WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE

01:39:35.369 --> 01:39:38.839
COMMITTEE, MR. QUIRK-SILVA. CAN

01:39:38.906 --> 01:39:41.909
YOU JUST KIND OF GIVE ME A

01:39:41.975 --> 01:39:44.445
SCENARIO OF. BECAUSE THE SUMMARY

01:39:44.511 --> 01:39:48.048
SAYS THAT ANY NEWLY CONSTRUCTED

01:39:48.115 --> 01:39:52.486
ACTIVE SOLAR SOLAR. SO YOU'RE

01:39:52.553 --> 01:39:54.288
TALKING ABOUT UNITS THAT HAVE

01:39:54.355 --> 01:39:56.290
NOT BEEN BUILT OR HAVE SOLAR OR

01:39:56.357 --> 01:39:57.925
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT GOING

01:39:57.991 --> 01:40:01.128
BACKWARDS ON THIS. IT YEAH, IT'S

01:40:01.195 --> 01:40:03.297
FOR A NEW SOLAR INSTALLATION. SO

01:40:03.364 --> 01:40:04.665
IF SOMEBODY PUTS SOLAR PANELS

01:40:04.732 --> 01:40:06.433
AND A BATTERY ON THEIR HOME,

01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:08.035
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE A

01:40:08.102 --> 01:40:09.002
REASSESSMENT THAT WOULD CAUSE

01:40:09.069 --> 01:40:10.804
THEIR PROPERTY TAXES TO GO UP.

01:40:10.871 --> 01:40:13.006
AND THAT'S BEEN IN EFFECT FOR 25

01:40:13.073 --> 01:40:14.641
YEARS. AND THIS KEEPS THAT IN

01:40:14.708 --> 01:40:19.480
EFFECT. AND. SO THAT WOULD BE

01:40:19.546 --> 01:40:22.282
LIKE SAY FROM STARTING NOW OR IF

01:40:22.349 --> 01:40:25.619
JUST IF IT, IF IT IS SIGNED

01:40:25.686 --> 01:40:29.123
GOING BACKWARDS OR. NO, JUST

01:40:29.189 --> 01:40:31.392
GOING FORWARD. GOING FORWARD. SO

01:40:31.458 --> 01:40:34.161
FOR THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE ALREADY

01:40:34.228 --> 01:40:36.430
PUT IN SOLAR AND SINCE YOU'RE

01:40:36.497 --> 01:40:38.699
TRYING TO PROTECT THE IF YOU

01:40:38.766 --> 01:40:40.000
WANT TO SAY PROMISE THAT WAS

01:40:40.067 --> 01:40:43.303
MADE AS FAR AS THIS BENEFIT,

01:40:43.370 --> 01:40:44.738
RIGHT, TAX BENEFIT, RIGHT,

01:40:44.805 --> 01:40:47.441
PEOPLE WOULDN'T HAVE TO DO

01:40:47.508 --> 01:40:48.609
ANYTHING IF THEY ALREADY HAVE

01:40:48.675 --> 01:40:51.278
SOLAR AND BATTERY, THAT THEY

01:40:51.345 --> 01:40:54.415
WOULD CONTINUE TO NOT HAVE A

01:40:54.481 --> 01:40:59.353
REASSESSMENT. RIGHT? OKAY. I

01:40:59.420 --> 01:41:01.221
DEFINITELY SUPPORT THIS. I KNOW

01:41:01.288 --> 01:41:02.756
THAT THERE'S A LOT OF CONFUSION

01:41:02.823 --> 01:41:04.925
OUT THERE, AS WE HAVE SEEN WITH

01:41:04.992 --> 01:41:08.495
OTHER BILLS, BUT I DO THINK

01:41:08.562 --> 01:41:09.630
CLARIFYING IT BECAUSE THERE'S SO

01:41:09.696 --> 01:41:12.666
MANY DIFFERENT SCENARIOS OF THE

01:41:12.733 --> 01:41:14.968
WAY IT'S WRITTEN IS NEWLY

01:41:15.035 --> 01:41:17.037
CONSTRUCTED. IT FEELS LIKE A NEW

01:41:17.104 --> 01:41:19.506
HOMES THAT ARE BEING BUILT. SO

01:41:19.573 --> 01:41:21.775
IT'S JUST THE LANGUAGE, BUT

01:41:21.842 --> 01:41:23.811

RELIEF AND EASE THE RECOVERY AND

01:42:51.031 --> 01:42:53.467
REBUILD FOR VICTIMS OF THE

01:42:53.534 --> 01:42:55.969
WILDFIRES. AS WE KNOW, NEARLY

01:42:56.036 --> 01:42:57.104
20,000 STRUCTURES WERE DAMAGED

01:42:57.170 --> 01:43:01.108
OR DESTROYED AND THOUSANDS OF

01:43:01.174 --> 01:43:03.010
PALISADES AND ALTADENA FAMILIES

01:43:03.076 --> 01:43:04.378

YOUR MICROPHONE UP? YEAH. OF

01:43:05.546 --> 01:43:07.714
COURSE. SO AS HOMEOWNERS HAVE

01:43:07.781 --> 01:43:09.049
BEEN NAVIGATING THE TRAUMA AND

01:43:09.116 --> 01:43:10.217
THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH

01:43:10.284 --> 01:43:13.387
THE FIRES, FILING OF MISFORTUNE

01:43:13.453 --> 01:43:14.688
AND CALAMITY CLAIMS WITHIN THE

01:43:14.755 --> 01:43:16.156
EXISTING 12 MONTH DEADLINE MAY

01:43:16.223 --> 01:43:17.257
BE DIFFICULT. WE KNOW THAT

01:43:17.324 --> 01:43:19.526
REBUILDING AFTER A DISASTER IS A

01:43:19.593 --> 01:43:20.527
REALLY COMPLICATED TASK, AND

01:43:20.594 --> 01:43:22.329
RESIDENTS HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH

01:43:22.396 --> 01:43:25.933
INSURERS AND COMPLETION OF THE

01:43:25.999 --> 01:43:27.401
PAPERWORK. COMPETITION FOR

01:43:27.467 --> 01:43:29.570
CONTRACTORS PERMITTING, ETC.

01:43:29.636 --> 01:43:31.071
JUST TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF

01:43:31.138 --> 01:43:32.406
THE IMPACTS OF ALL OF THIS,

01:43:32.472 --> 01:43:33.874
ACCORDING TO DATA FROM THE CITY

01:43:33.941 --> 01:43:36.276
OF MALIBU, I THINK ONLY ABOUT A

01:43:36.343 --> 01:43:38.312
THIRD OF THE HOMES THAT WERE

01:43:38.378 --> 01:43:38.845
DESTROYED DURING THE 2018

01:43:38.912 --> 01:43:39.680
WOOLSEY FIRE HAVE BEEN REBUILT

01:43:39.746 --> 01:43:42.416
TO DATE. THE LAW ALSO LACKS

01:43:42.482 --> 01:43:43.684
FLEXIBILITY FOR PROPERTIES THAT

01:43:43.750 --> 01:43:46.520
ARE PRIMARILY USED BY CHARITABLE

01:43:46.587 --> 01:43:48.655
HOSPITAL, HOSPITAL OR RELIGIOUS

01:43:48.722 --> 01:43:50.157
ORGANIZATIONS. SO JUST TO GIVE

01:43:50.223 --> 01:43:52.359
YOU THE LAW SAYS THAT THE

01:43:52.426 --> 01:43:53.226
INSTITUTIONS GET THIS SPECIAL

01:43:53.293 --> 01:43:54.962
TAX EXEMPTION, BUT IT ONLY

01:43:55.028 --> 01:43:56.930
APPLIES WHEN THE PROPERTY IS

01:43:56.997 --> 01:43:58.732
BEING USED FOR THOSE PURPOSES.

01:43:58.799 --> 01:44:00.834
SO OF COURSE, THE PROPERTY BURNS

01:44:00.901 --> 01:44:02.369
DOWN AND NO LONGER THEY'RE NO

01:44:02.436 --> 01:44:04.471
LONGER ABLE TO GET THEIR THEIR

01:44:04.538 --> 01:44:05.973
SPECIAL TAX STATUS BECAUSE IT'S

01:44:06.039 --> 01:44:07.107
NO LONGER BEING USED FOR THE

01:44:07.174 --> 01:44:08.875
PURPOSE. SO HERE'S WHAT THE BILL

01:44:08.942 --> 01:44:10.644
SEEKS TO DO. IT EXTENDS THE

01:44:10.711 --> 01:44:12.145
DEADLINES FOR VICTIMS TO FILE

01:44:12.212 --> 01:44:13.146
MISFORTUNE AND CALAMITY CLAIMS

01:44:13.213 --> 01:44:15.782
FROM 12 TO 24 MONTHS. IT EXTENDS

01:44:15.849 --> 01:44:17.150
SPECIAL EXEMPTIONS FOR UP TO

01:44:17.217 --> 01:44:19.119
EIGHT YEARS, AND IT ALSO EXTENDS

01:44:19.186 --> 01:44:20.220
THE TIME THAT HOMEOWNERS HAVE TO

01:44:20.287 --> 01:44:22.122
REBUILD FROM 5 TO 8 YEARS FOR

01:44:22.189 --> 01:44:24.224
THE TAX YEAR TO TRANSFER TO THE

01:44:24.291 --> 01:44:25.792
NEW CONSTRUCTION. RECENT

01:44:25.859 --> 01:44:27.194
AMENDMENTS ALSO EXPAND THE BILL

01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:28.495

300 STRUCTURES IN THE FALL OF

LAST YEAR. THE AMENDMENTS ALSO

01:44:34.368 --> 01:44:35.869
EXTEND TAX EXEMPTIONS PROVIDED

01:44:35.936 --> 01:44:37.704
TO DISABLED VETERANS WHO USE
