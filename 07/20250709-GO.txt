THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO

BILL 364 CONCERNING OUTDOOR

00:32:47.432 --> 00:32:49.934
ADVERTISING DISPLAYS. I'M HERE

00:32:50.001 --> 00:32:51.302
TO HIGHLIGHT HOW OUTDATED THE

00:32:51.369 --> 00:32:52.670
REGULATION REGARDING THE

00:32:52.737 --> 00:32:54.305
PLACEMENT OF THE NEW BILLBOARDS

00:32:54.372 --> 00:32:56.307
ARE NEGATIVELY IMPACTING LOCAL

00:32:56.374 --> 00:32:57.742
JURISDICTIONS SUCH AS FOUNTAIN

00:32:57.809 --> 00:33:00.244
VALLEY. CURRENTLY, IF A FREEWAY

00:33:00.311 --> 00:33:01.846
UNDERGOES A NEW ALIGNMENT, OR IN

00:33:01.913 --> 00:33:03.715
CASE OF THE 405 FREEWAY IN

00:33:03.781 --> 00:33:06.017
ORANGE COUNTY AND EXPANSION, YOU

00:33:06.084 --> 00:33:08.553
CANNOT APPLY TO PLACE A NEW

00:33:08.619 --> 00:33:10.088
OUTDOOR ADVERTISING DISPLAY LIKE

00:33:10.154 --> 00:33:10.955
BILLBOARDS UNTIL THE DEPARTMENT

00:33:11.022 --> 00:33:12.890
OF TRANSPORTATION OFFICIALLY

00:33:12.957 --> 00:33:14.826
ACCEPTS THE FREEWAY. ALTHOUGH

00:33:14.892 --> 00:33:16.861
THE 405 FREEWAY HAS BEEN FULLY

00:33:16.928 --> 00:33:19.530
OPEN TO VEHICULAR TRAFFIC FOR

00:33:19.597 --> 00:33:21.532
ALMOST TWO YEARS, WE'VE BEEN

00:33:21.599 --> 00:33:23.034
INFORMED THAT IT WON'T

00:33:23.101 --> 00:33:23.701
OFFICIALLY BE ACCEPTED FOR

00:33:23.768 --> 00:33:26.604
ANOTHER THREE YEARS. THIS RULE

00:33:26.671 --> 00:33:28.439
MADE SENSE WHEN ENTIRELY NEW

00:33:28.506 --> 00:33:30.908
FREEWAYS WERE BEING CONSTRUCTED

00:33:30.975 --> 00:33:32.043
TO ACCOMMODATE OUR RAPIDLY

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:34.812
GROWING POPULATION. HOWEVER, OUR

00:33:34.879 --> 00:33:35.913
CIRCUMSTANCES TODAY ARE

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:38.516
DIFFERENT. THE 4 OR 5 FREEWAY

00:33:38.583 --> 00:33:39.817
ALIGNMENT AND EXPANSION WERE

00:33:39.884 --> 00:33:42.954
RELATIVELY SMALL IN TERMS OF THE

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:44.655
IMPACT TO THE CITY. LIKE

00:33:44.722 --> 00:33:46.391
FOUNTAIN VALLEY. TWO YEARS AGO,

00:33:46.457 --> 00:33:48.192
OUR CITY COUNCIL APPROVED

00:33:48.259 --> 00:33:49.794
PLACING TWO BILLBOARDS ON THE

00:33:49.861 --> 00:33:52.230
405 FREEWAY. THESE SIGNS

00:33:52.296 --> 00:33:55.032
TOGETHER WOULD GENERATE AT LEAST

00:33:55.099 --> 00:33:57.235
$1.2 MILLION EACH YEAR. THIS IS

00:33:57.301 --> 00:33:58.903
MUCH NEEDED REVENUE TO HELP US

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:00.705
PAY FOR ESSENTIAL SERVICES SUCH

00:34:00.772 --> 00:34:03.107
AS POLICE AND FIRE, WHICH TAKE

00:34:03.174 --> 00:34:06.511
UP NEARLY 70% OF OUR BUDGET.

00:34:06.577 --> 00:34:08.312
HOWEVER, THE CITY AND OUR

00:34:08.379 --> 00:34:10.515
OUTDOOR ADVERTISING PARTNERS ARE

00:34:10.581 --> 00:34:12.617
CURRENTLY PRECLUDED FROM EVEN

00:34:12.683 --> 00:34:14.018
SUBMITTING AN APPLICATION FOR AT

00:34:14.085 --> 00:34:17.688
LEAST THREE YEARS. THIS DELAY IS

00:34:17.755 --> 00:34:20.625
ATTRIBUTED TO A REQUIRED PLANT

00:34:20.691 --> 00:34:22.427
ESTABLISHMENT PERIOD FOR A NEW

00:34:22.493 --> 00:34:24.929
LANDSCAPING ALONG THE FREEWAY.

00:34:24.996 --> 00:34:26.597
IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT

00:34:26.664 --> 00:34:27.865
BILLBOARDS AREN'T EVEN ALLOWED

00:34:27.932 --> 00:34:30.768
IN LANDSCAPE FREEWAY SEGMENT, SO

00:34:30.835 --> 00:34:33.237
WE'RE BEING PREVENTED FROM

00:34:33.304 --> 00:34:34.705
APPLYING FOR A BILLBOARD TO

00:34:34.772 --> 00:34:37.575
ENSURE LANDSCAPING THRIVES IN AN

00:34:37.642 --> 00:34:39.076
AREA WHERE THERE IS NO

00:34:39.143 --> 00:34:42.113
LANDSCAPING. AT THE SAME TIME,

00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:44.348
EVERY OTHER TYPE OF CONSTRUCTION

00:34:44.415 --> 00:34:46.117
PROJECT CAN OCCUR ADJACENT TO

00:34:46.184 --> 00:34:49.287
THE FREEWAY. BUSINESSES CAN

00:34:49.353 --> 00:34:51.789
ERECT THEIR OWN SIGN, NEW

00:34:51.856 --> 00:34:53.324
BUILDINGS CAN BE CONSTRUCTED,

00:34:53.391 --> 00:34:55.493
AND THE CITY HAS EVEN APPROVED A

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:59.430
NEW 650 NEW UNIT MULTIFAMILY

00:34:59.497 --> 00:35:01.232
RESIDENTIAL PROJECT NEXT TO THE

00:35:01.299 --> 00:35:03.668
FREEWAY. FOR SOME REASON,

00:35:03.734 --> 00:35:05.336
BILLBOARDS ARE THE TYPE OF

00:35:05.403 --> 00:35:07.505
IMPROVEMENT BEING PRECLUDED. TO

00:35:07.572 --> 00:35:09.207
BE CLEAR, THE FREEWAY EXPANSION

00:35:09.273 --> 00:35:11.042
IS COMPLETE AND FULLY

00:35:11.108 --> 00:35:13.511
FUNCTIONAL. THERE'S NO ONGOING

00:35:13.578 --> 00:35:15.546
CONSTRUCTION, AND THE PROPERTY

00:35:15.613 --> 00:35:16.647
AIN'T WITHIN THE FREEWAY'S RIGHT

00:35:16.714 --> 00:35:19.217
OF WAY. PLACING AN ADVERTISING

00:35:19.283 --> 00:35:22.019
SIGN ON THESE PROPERTY WOULD NO

00:35:22.086 --> 00:35:24.989
POSSIBLE IMPACT ON THE FREEWAY.

00:35:25.056 --> 00:35:27.925
IF SB 364 IS ENACTED, IT WOULD

00:35:27.992 --> 00:35:30.027
ALLOW CALTRANS TO AT LEAST

00:35:30.094 --> 00:35:31.429
CONSIDER THE MERITS OF THE

00:35:31.496 --> 00:35:33.664
APPLICATION AND THE SPECIFIC

00:35:33.731 --> 00:35:34.866
CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH REQUEST,

00:35:34.932 --> 00:35:36.901
AND MAKE A JUDGMENT BASED ON ITS

00:35:36.968 --> 00:35:39.036
INDIVIDUAL MERITS. THANK YOU FOR

00:35:39.103 --> 00:35:41.439
YOUR TIME. WE AGAIN URGE YOU TO

00:35:41.506 --> 00:35:44.442

TWO TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS TO THE

00:36:15.339 --> 00:36:19.243

AN EXCELLENT JOB OF SUMMARIZING

00:36:28.986 --> 00:36:32.423
IT, AND I DON'T SEE A LOT OF

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:35.126
ENTHUSIASM FOR TALKING ABOUT

00:36:35.192 --> 00:36:36.294
TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE OUTDOOR

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:38.296

00:42:13.464 --> 00:42:29.713

00:43:41.418 --> 00:43:43.520
YEAH. YOU CAN OPEN, PLEASE. AND

00:43:43.587 --> 00:43:45.255
THEN YOU'LL HAVE YOUR WITNESSES

00:43:45.322 --> 00:43:48.192

00:43:48.258 --> 00:43:49.593
YOU MAY BEGIN. OH, GREAT. THANK

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:51.829
YOU VERY MUCH. IT'S RARE THAT I

00:43:51.895 --> 00:43:53.697
GET TO WALK IN AND SIT RIGHT

00:43:53.764 --> 00:43:55.232
DOWN, BUT I'M IN THE RULES

00:43:55.299 --> 00:43:57.001
COMMITTEE, SO IT'LL BE GREAT TO

00:43:57.067 --> 00:43:58.035
GET BACK ANYWAY. THANK YOU,

00:43:58.102 --> 00:43:59.870
MADAM CHAIR. I'M PRESENTING

00:43:59.937 --> 00:44:03.374
SENATE BILL 470. IT EXTENDS THE

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:08.512
SUNSET, THAT OF SB 54, FOR WHICH

00:44:08.579 --> 00:44:11.615
I AUTHORED IN 2023. THAT SETS UP

00:44:11.682 --> 00:44:13.917
A NEW SYSTEM FOR OPEN MEETING

00:44:13.984 --> 00:44:15.886
LAWS FOR STATE BOARDS AND

00:44:15.953 --> 00:44:17.755
COMMISSIONS. AND THIS BILL WOULD

00:44:17.821 --> 00:44:20.424
EXTEND THE CURRENT LAW TO

00:44:20.491 --> 00:44:23.460
JANUARY 1ST, 2030. THIS SYSTEM

00:44:23.527 --> 00:44:25.295
HAS WORKED. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW

00:44:25.362 --> 00:44:28.532
IT TO CONTINUE. AND THERE'S AN

00:44:28.599 --> 00:44:30.300
ADDITIONAL SUNSET THAT I JUST

00:44:30.367 --> 00:44:32.436
MENTIONED. SO IF THERE ARE ANY

00:44:32.503 --> 00:44:34.705
CONCERNS THAT MATERIALIZE,

00:44:34.772 --> 00:44:36.206
THERE'S A CHANCE TO DEAL WITH IT

00:44:36.273 --> 00:44:39.343
IN 2029 BEFORE THE BILL WOULD

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:42.179
EXPIRE IN 2030, WHEN THE

00:44:42.246 --> 00:44:45.115
BAGLEY-KEENE ACT WAS ADOPTED FOR

00:44:45.182 --> 00:44:48.786
OPEN MEETINGS IN 1967, NO ONE

00:44:48.852 --> 00:44:51.622
ENVISIONED THE COMPUTER AGE. THE

00:44:51.688 --> 00:44:53.023
AMERICANS FOR DISABILITIES ACT

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:54.825
WAS STILL A GENERATION OFF INTO

00:44:54.892 --> 00:44:57.528
THE FUTURE. WHEN THAT WAS

00:44:57.594 --> 00:44:59.463
ADOPTED, AND THE IDEA THAT

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:00.798
CITIZENS COULD PARTICIPATE IN

00:45:00.864 --> 00:45:03.300
PUBLIC MEETINGS REMOTELY WAS NOT

00:45:03.367 --> 00:45:07.438
COMMON. THE COVID PANDEMIC GAVE

00:45:07.504 --> 00:45:10.808
US A TEST AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO

00:45:10.874 --> 00:45:13.444
SEE EXACTLY WHAT THAT WAS LIKE,

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:15.679
BOTH THE BENEFITS AND THE

00:45:15.746 --> 00:45:17.481
DRAWBACKS. AND THIS BILL

00:45:17.548 --> 00:45:18.982
CONTINUES. THE PREVIOUS ONE

00:45:19.049 --> 00:45:20.984
TAKES ADVANTAGE OF WHAT WE HAVE

00:45:21.051 --> 00:45:22.853
LEARNED AND TAKES THE GOOD

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:25.122
PIECES OF THE ALTERNATE

00:45:25.189 --> 00:45:27.191
ACCOMMODATIONS. FIRST OFF, THIS

00:45:27.257 --> 00:45:28.992
BILL GIVES A CHOICE. STATE

00:45:29.059 --> 00:45:31.595
BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS CAN

00:45:31.662 --> 00:45:33.263
CHOOSE TO USE THE EXISTING

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:35.766
SYSTEM OR THE ALTERNATIVE THAT

00:45:35.833 --> 00:45:37.835
IS SET FORTH BY THIS BILL. SO

00:45:37.901 --> 00:45:41.705
THERE'S NO OBLIGATION TO USE THE

00:45:41.772 --> 00:45:45.509
REFORM. IT CAN BE DONE. AND IF

00:45:45.576 --> 00:45:48.011
THEY CHOOSE TO TAKE THE

00:45:48.078 --> 00:45:49.847
ALTERNATIVE AND OPERATE UNDER

00:45:49.913 --> 00:45:52.216
IT, THEY HAVE TO HAVE A MAJORITY

00:45:52.282 --> 00:45:55.352
OF THEIR MEMBERS PRESENT AT THE

00:45:55.419 --> 00:45:59.923
MAIN LOCATION. AND IF THEY ALLOW

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:03.494
REMOTE PARTICIPATION, THEY HAVE

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:05.429
TO ALLOW REMOTE PARTICIPATION BY

00:46:05.496 --> 00:46:08.899
THE PUBLIC. AND IN DOING THAT,

00:46:08.966 --> 00:46:10.701
THERE'S JUST CERTAIN RULES THAT

00:46:10.767 --> 00:46:12.936
CAME FROM THE PRACTICES WE

00:46:13.003 --> 00:46:15.539
LEARNED. IF THE SYSTEM GOES DOWN

00:46:15.606 --> 00:46:16.874
FOR THE REMOTE PARTICIPANTS, YOU

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:18.742
HAVE TO PAUSE THE ENTIRE

00:46:18.809 --> 00:46:20.744
MEETING. IT REQUIRES THAT

00:46:20.811 --> 00:46:23.380
CAMERAS HAVE TO BE ON FOR THE

00:46:23.447 --> 00:46:25.115
PEOPLE PARTICIPATING REMOTELY.

00:46:25.182 --> 00:46:27.017
AND I KNOW IN ONE IN THE ONE

00:46:27.084 --> 00:46:28.352
OPPOSITION LETTER, IT SAYS IT

00:46:28.418 --> 00:46:30.587
ALLOWS PEOPLE TO BE PARTICIPATE

00:46:30.654 --> 00:46:31.688
WITH THEIR CAMERAS OFF. THAT'S

00:46:31.755 --> 00:46:35.759
NOT CORRECT. THIS BILL SAYS IT

00:46:35.826 --> 00:46:40.731
HAS TO BE ON. IT NO LONGER

00:46:40.797 --> 00:46:42.833
REQUIRES THAT THE REMOTE

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:44.701
PARTICIPANTS HAVE TO LIST THEIR

00:46:44.768 --> 00:46:47.137
HOME ADDRESS TO PARTICIPATE. AND

00:46:47.204 --> 00:46:48.672
SINCE THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO

00:46:48.739 --> 00:46:51.041
MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WITH

00:46:51.108 --> 00:46:55.112
DISABILITIES OR SENIORS ARE ABLE

00:46:55.179 --> 00:46:56.613
TO PARTICIPATE, IF IT'S HARD FOR

00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:58.315
THEM TO GET TO MEETINGS. THIS

00:46:58.382 --> 00:46:59.783
DOESN'T RAISE THE SECURITY

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:01.084
QUESTION OF SOMEBODY THAT'S A

00:47:01.151 --> 00:47:02.719
PERSON WITH DISABILITIES BEING

00:47:02.786 --> 00:47:04.121
HOME ALONE, HAVING TO PUBLISH

00:47:04.188 --> 00:47:06.190
THEIR ADDRESS WHILE THEY'RE

00:47:06.256 --> 00:47:08.392
THERE IN THE MEETING, SO IT

00:47:08.458 --> 00:47:11.161
PROTECTS THEIR SECURITY ADVISORY

00:47:11.228 --> 00:47:13.330
BOARDS THAT HAVE NO DECISION

00:47:13.397 --> 00:47:15.299
MAKING AUTHORITY WOULD BE

00:47:15.365 --> 00:47:17.734
ALLOWED TO MEET REMOTELY

00:47:17.801 --> 00:47:19.269
ENHANCING THAT KIND OF

00:47:19.336 --> 00:47:20.270
REPRESENTATION. AND I KNOW THERE

00:47:20.337 --> 00:47:22.506
IS A SEPARATE BILL UNRELATED TO

00:47:22.573 --> 00:47:24.942
THIS ONE THAT'S MOVING AHEAD ON

00:47:25.008 --> 00:47:26.777
ADVISORY BOARDS. SO THIS REALLY

00:47:26.843 --> 00:47:28.078
ALLOWS FOR SENIORS AND PEOPLE

00:47:28.145 --> 00:47:29.546
WITH DISABILITIES TO PARTICIPATE

00:47:29.613 --> 00:47:31.782
IN A WAY THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE

00:47:31.848 --> 00:47:33.550
ABLE TO UNDER THE ORIGINAL

00:47:33.617 --> 00:47:35.719
SYSTEM. I BELIEVE IT'S WORKED.

00:47:35.786 --> 00:47:36.987
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME CONCERNS

00:47:37.054 --> 00:47:38.989
THAT HAVE COME UP REGARDING THE

00:47:39.056 --> 00:47:40.490
FLEXIBILITY FOR MEMBERS OF A

00:47:40.557 --> 00:47:42.226
REGULATORY BOARD TO MEET

00:47:42.292 --> 00:47:43.994
REMOTELY AFTER QUORUM HAS BEEN

00:47:44.061 --> 00:47:45.896
ESTABLISHED. THE CURRENT

00:47:45.963 --> 00:47:47.631
LANGUAGE TAKES INTO

00:47:47.698 --> 00:47:48.732
CONSIDERATION THE OTHER FACTORS

00:47:48.799 --> 00:47:50.500
THAT COULD REQUIRE SOMEONE TO

00:47:50.567 --> 00:47:53.036
PARTICIPATE REMOTELY, SUCH AS

00:47:53.103 --> 00:47:54.705
CARETAKING, LESS FLEXIBLE WORK

00:47:54.771 --> 00:47:56.540
SCHEDULES, OR THE SHEER SIZE OF

00:47:56.607 --> 00:48:01.612
OUR STATE. SO SB 470 REALLY

00:48:01.678 --> 00:48:03.780
TAKES INTO ACCOUNT DISABILITY

00:48:03.847 --> 00:48:04.548
ACCOMMODATIONS. ALL WE'VE

00:48:04.615 --> 00:48:07.818
LEARNED DURING COVID ALLOWS

00:48:07.884 --> 00:48:10.587
REMOTE PARTICIPATION ONCE A

00:48:10.654 --> 00:48:12.823
MAJORITY HAS BEEN REACHED IN

00:48:12.889 --> 00:48:14.925
PERSON, THAT OTHERWISE PEOPLE

00:48:14.992 --> 00:48:16.560
THAT MIGHT NOT PARTICIPATE ARE

00:48:16.627 --> 00:48:18.996
ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE, AND WHO

00:48:19.062 --> 00:48:21.531
MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COME

00:48:21.598 --> 00:48:22.799
TO SACRAMENTO. AND JUST GIVEN MY

00:48:22.866 --> 00:48:25.002
EXPERIENCE, HAVING PRESENTED THE

00:48:25.068 --> 00:48:27.938
PRIOR BILL IN THIS ONE 6 OR 7

00:48:28.005 --> 00:48:30.007
TIMES, I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE

00:48:30.073 --> 00:48:32.276
THIS IS ABOUT STATE BOARDS AND

00:48:32.342 --> 00:48:33.644
COMMISSIONS, BECAUSE SO MANY

00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:35.445
TIMES PEOPLE SPEAK ABOUT WHAT

00:48:35.512 --> 00:48:37.547
THEIR EXPERIENCE IS WITH LOCAL

00:48:37.614 --> 00:48:39.416
GOVERNMENT. THIS BILL IS NOT

00:48:39.483 --> 00:48:41.051
ABOUT LOCAL GOVERNMENT. FOR

00:48:41.118 --> 00:48:43.453
THOSE OF US THAT LIVED IN LOCAL

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:45.122
GOVERNMENT AND KNOW WHAT THAT

00:48:45.188 --> 00:48:47.391
IS. SO AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME,

00:48:47.457 --> 00:48:49.192
I WOULD LIKE AN AYE VOTE AND

00:48:49.259 --> 00:48:50.927
WITH ME TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT ARE

00:48:50.994 --> 00:48:52.529
ETHAN RARICK, THE EXECUTIVE

00:48:52.596 --> 00:48:53.830
DIRECTOR OF THE LITTLE HOOVER

00:48:53.897 --> 00:48:54.898
COMMISSION, AND AARON

00:48:54.965 --> 00:48:56.300
CARRUTHERS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

00:48:56.366 --> 00:48:58.001
OF THE STATE COUNCIL ON

00:48:58.068 --> 00:48:59.803
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES.

00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:02.873
THANK YOU. THANK YOU, MADAM

00:49:02.939 --> 00:49:04.374
CHAIR AND MEMBERS, I'M ETHAN

00:49:04.441 --> 00:49:05.342
RARICK. I'M THE EXECUTIVE

00:49:05.409 --> 00:49:07.377
DIRECTOR OF THE LITTLE HOOVER

00:49:07.444 --> 00:49:07.978
COMMISSION. OUR COMMISSION IS

00:49:08.045 --> 00:49:08.712
CHARGED IN STATUTE WITH

00:49:08.779 --> 00:49:10.080
RECOMMENDING CHANGES IN STATE

00:49:10.147 --> 00:49:11.481
POLICY THAT FOSTER ECONOMY,

00:49:11.548 --> 00:49:13.784
EFFICIENCY OR IMPROVED SERVICE.

00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:16.253
IN 2021, WE SURVEYED

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:17.220
BAGLEY-KEENE AGENCIES ABOUT

00:49:17.287 --> 00:49:18.789
THEIR EXPERIENCES USING REMOTE

00:49:18.855 --> 00:49:21.224
MEETING TECHNOLOGY DURING THE

00:49:21.291 --> 00:49:22.893
PANDEMIC. WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT

00:49:22.959 --> 00:49:24.795
95% SAID THEY HAD EXPERIENCED

00:49:24.861 --> 00:49:26.563
MORE PUBLIC ATTENDANCE AT THEIR

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:27.864
MEETINGS. MORE THAN 90% SAID

00:49:27.931 --> 00:49:29.900
THEY HAD SAVED MONEY. ABOUT HALF

00:49:29.966 --> 00:49:31.168
SAID THEY HAD EXPERIENCED

00:49:31.234 --> 00:49:32.202
GREATER ATTENDANCE FROM MEMBERS

00:49:32.269 --> 00:49:34.471
OF THE BOARD OR COMMISSION. NONE

00:49:34.538 --> 00:49:36.406
HAD EXPERIENCED LESS ATTENDANCE.

00:49:36.473 --> 00:49:37.507
BASED ON THOSE SURVEY FINDINGS,

00:49:37.574 --> 00:49:39.176
WE RECOMMENDED THAT THE LAW BE

00:49:39.242 --> 00:49:40.544
CHANGED TO FACILITATE GREATER

00:49:40.610 --> 00:49:43.113
USE OF REMOTE TECHNOLOGY. AND IN

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:44.147
2023, AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED,

00:49:44.214 --> 00:49:45.549
THE LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZED THE

00:49:45.615 --> 00:49:47.150
NEED FOR THOSE CHANGES BY

00:49:47.217 --> 00:49:49.986
PASSING SB 544. THIS BILL, AS

00:49:50.053 --> 00:49:52.289
YOU KNOW, EXTENDS THE SUNSET

00:49:52.356 --> 00:49:54.991
PROVISION CONTAINED IN SB 544.

00:49:55.058 --> 00:49:56.560
SINCE THAT BILL TOOK EFFECT, OUR

00:49:56.626 --> 00:49:58.662
COMMISSION HAS USED REMOTE

00:49:58.729 --> 00:49:59.963
TECHNOLOGY FOR MEETING

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:01.631
EXTENSIVELY. WE CONTINUE TO SEE

00:50:01.698 --> 00:50:03.233
INCREASED PUBLIC PARTICIPATION

00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:04.334
AND GREATER ATTENDANCE BY THE

00:50:04.401 --> 00:50:05.869
MEMBERS OF OUR COMMISSION. WE

00:50:05.936 --> 00:50:07.771
HAVE NOT HAD THE RESOURCES TO

00:50:07.838 --> 00:50:09.206
REPEAT OUR EARLIER SURVEY, BUT

00:50:09.272 --> 00:50:10.774
WE'VE HEARD ANECDOTALLY, AND I

00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:12.275
BELIEVE MR. CROTHERS CAN SPEAK

00:50:12.342 --> 00:50:13.810
TO THIS OF OTHER BOARDS AND

00:50:13.877 --> 00:50:14.845
COMMISSIONS USING THIS

00:50:14.911 --> 00:50:17.047
TECHNOLOGY VERY PRODUCTIVELY. WE

00:50:17.114 --> 00:50:19.282
THINK THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY

00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:20.150
ASSISTS IN MAKING STATE

00:50:20.217 --> 00:50:21.752
GOVERNMENT LOOK MORE LIKE

00:50:21.818 --> 00:50:22.486
CALIFORNIA FOR MANY

00:50:22.552 --> 00:50:23.453
CALIFORNIANS. IT'S DIFFICULT TO

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:25.088
SERVE ON A STATE BOARD OR

00:50:25.155 --> 00:50:25.956
COMMISSION IF YOU ARE

00:50:26.022 --> 00:50:27.190
RESPONSIBLE FOR ELDER CARE,

00:50:27.257 --> 00:50:28.959
CHILD CARE, HAVE A WORKING JOB

00:50:29.025 --> 00:50:31.328
SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE STATE,

00:50:31.395 --> 00:50:31.995
IT'S HARD TO GET TO SACRAMENTO.

00:50:32.062 --> 00:50:33.430
WE THINK THIS BILL INCREASES

00:50:33.497 --> 00:50:35.065
DIVERSITY AND EQUITY IN STATE

00:50:35.132 --> 00:50:35.999
GOVERNMENT AND THEREFORE WE URGE

00:50:36.066 --> 00:50:39.035
AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. MR.

00:50:39.102 --> 00:50:40.137
THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR AND

00:50:40.203 --> 00:50:41.204
MEMBERS. I'M AARON CARRUTHERS.

00:50:41.271 --> 00:50:42.939
I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF

00:50:43.006 --> 00:50:44.441
CALIFORNIA'S STATE COUNCIL ON

00:50:44.508 --> 00:50:45.409
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. THE

00:50:45.475 --> 00:50:47.711
STATE COUNCIL IS AN INDEPENDENT

00:50:47.778 --> 00:50:49.513
STATE ENTITY THAT'S FUNDED BY

00:50:49.579 --> 00:50:51.515
CONGRESS. AND WE EXIST TO BE

00:50:51.581 --> 00:50:52.949
DISRUPTORS. WE DISRUPT SYSTEMS

00:50:53.016 --> 00:50:55.152
TO MAKE THEM MORE AGILE, MORE

00:50:55.218 --> 00:50:56.353
ACCOUNTABLE, MORE EFFICIENT FOR

00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:57.721
THE PEOPLE THEY'RE THERE TO

00:50:57.788 --> 00:50:59.623
SERVE, WHICH IS PEOPLE WITH

00:50:59.689 --> 00:51:00.424
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:02.359
THEIR FAMILIES. THE COUNCIL

00:51:02.426 --> 00:51:04.494
ITSELF EXISTS OF 31 GOVERNOR

00:51:04.561 --> 00:51:06.029
APPOINTED MEMBERS. A THIRD OF

00:51:06.096 --> 00:51:07.030
THOSE ARE PEOPLE WITH

00:51:07.097 --> 00:51:08.231
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES,

00:51:08.298 --> 00:51:09.666
ANOTHER THIRD ARE FAMILY

00:51:09.733 --> 00:51:11.301
MEMBERS, AND THE COUNCIL'S BEEN

00:51:11.368 --> 00:51:12.836
ABLE TO OPERATE THROUGHOUT THE

00:51:12.903 --> 00:51:14.638
PANDEMIC AND AFTERWARD BECAUSE

00:51:14.704 --> 00:51:16.506
OF THE FLEXIBILITIES AND

00:51:16.573 --> 00:51:17.441
PROVISIONS IN CURRENT LAW

00:51:17.507 --> 00:51:20.310
THROUGH SB 544. HERE'S HOW WE'RE

00:51:20.377 --> 00:51:22.546
ABLE TO DO IT WITH TRANSPARENCY

00:51:22.612 --> 00:51:24.281
AND DO IT WITH ACCOUNTABILITY.

00:51:24.347 --> 00:51:25.615
UNDER THE CURRENT LAW, THE

00:51:25.682 --> 00:51:27.250
COUNCIL MEETS SIX TIMES A YEAR.

00:51:27.317 --> 00:51:28.952
HALF OF THOSE MEETINGS ARE IN

00:51:29.019 --> 00:51:31.188
PERSON, HALF ARE BY REMOTE.

00:51:31.254 --> 00:51:33.089
USING THE REMOTE OPTION. DURING

00:51:33.156 --> 00:51:34.491
THE VIRTUAL MEETINGS, THE

00:51:34.558 --> 00:51:36.927
COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE ON SCREEN

00:51:36.993 --> 00:51:38.728
CAMERAS ON ANYBODY WHO ENTERS

00:51:38.795 --> 00:51:40.464

CARETAKERS ARE ANNOUNCED TO THE

00:51:41.998 --> 00:51:45.168
PUBLIC, SO WE KNOW WHO'S THERE,

00:51:45.235 --> 00:51:46.536
THE FLEXIBILITY AND THE CURRENT

00:51:46.603 --> 00:51:48.772
LAW ALLOWS US VERY VARIOUS WAYS

00:51:48.839 --> 00:51:50.640
TO MEET, CONDUCT THE BUSINESS

00:51:50.707 --> 00:51:52.442
TRANSPARENTLY, AND REMAIN

00:51:52.509 --> 00:51:53.877

ONE HAS AUTISM, ONE HAS DOWN

00:52:21.171 --> 00:52:23.673
SYNDROME. NOW, THE AMOUNT OF

UNEXPECTED THINGS THAT CAN GO ON

00:52:25.342 --> 00:52:27.677
IN EACH OF OUR LIVES ARE JUST

00:52:27.744 --> 00:52:28.712
INNUMERABLE. THEY'RE ALSO

00:52:28.778 --> 00:52:31.181
MULTIPLIED IN THEIR LIVES TO THE

00:52:31.248 --> 00:52:32.549
FLEXIBILITY THAT EXISTS IN

00:52:32.616 --> 00:52:35.352

00:54:06.009 --> 00:54:07.410
THIS BILL WOULD WEAKEN THE

00:54:07.477 --> 00:54:09.245
BACKLINK KING OPEN MEETING ACT

00:54:09.312 --> 00:54:11.348
BY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING

00:54:11.414 --> 00:54:13.550
TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY

00:54:13.617 --> 00:54:15.752
IN PERSON. CIVIC ENGAGEMENT IS

00:54:15.819 --> 00:54:17.854
AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR

00:54:17.921 --> 00:54:21.458
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. HOWEVER, SB

00:54:21.524 --> 00:54:23.760
740 IS PRIORITIZING THE

00:54:23.827 --> 00:54:25.328
CONVENIENCE OF PUBLIC OFFICIALS

00:54:25.395 --> 00:54:27.831
OVER THE MEANINGFUL IN-PERSON

00:54:27.897 --> 00:54:28.898
PARTICIPATION OF THE PUBLIC THAT

00:54:28.965 --> 00:54:32.569
IS BEING SERVED. TO BE CLEAR, WE

00:54:32.636 --> 00:54:34.337
STRONGLY SUPPORT THE INCREASED

00:54:34.404 --> 00:54:36.439
OPTIONS FOR REMOTE PARTICIPATION

00:54:36.506 --> 00:54:37.907
WHEN IT IS FOR MEMBERS OF THE

00:54:37.974 --> 00:54:39.743
PUBLIC AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS.

00:54:39.809 --> 00:54:41.978
THIS BILL AIMS TO SUPPORT, SUCH

00:54:42.045 --> 00:54:44.748
AS SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH

00:54:44.814 --> 00:54:46.983
DISABILITIES. HOWEVER, WE MUST

00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:48.885
OPPOSE THIS BILL BECAUSE IT'S

00:54:48.952 --> 00:54:50.954
NOT NARROWLY TAILORED AND WOULD

00:54:51.021 --> 00:54:53.023
REMOVE THE LONG STANDING

00:54:53.089 --> 00:54:54.758
REQUIREMENT THAT PUBLIC MEETINGS

00:54:54.824 --> 00:54:57.894
BE HELD IN PERSON IN PUBLIC

00:54:57.961 --> 00:54:59.529
PLACES WHERE THE PUBLIC CAN

00:54:59.596 --> 00:55:01.064
PETITION LEADERS AND OTHER

00:55:01.131 --> 00:55:03.667
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS FACE TO

00:55:03.733 --> 00:55:07.637
FACE, FURTHER ALLOWING FOR MORE

00:55:07.704 --> 00:55:08.905
THE REMOTE PARTICIPATION OF

00:55:08.972 --> 00:55:10.640
BOARD AND COMMISSION MEMBERS

00:55:10.707 --> 00:55:13.009
WITHOUT THE REQUIRED PUBLIC

00:55:13.076 --> 00:55:15.445
DISCLOSURES, IS NOT GOOD FOR THE

00:55:15.512 --> 00:55:16.880
PUBLIC AND SHOULD BE NARROWLY

00:55:16.946 --> 00:55:19.149
TAILORED TO ISSUES INVOLVING

00:55:19.215 --> 00:55:21.551
MEMBERS WITH HARDSHIPS,

00:55:21.618 --> 00:55:23.520
DISABILITIES AND WITH THE PROPER

00:55:23.586 --> 00:55:25.088
GUARDRAILS TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC

00:55:25.155 --> 00:55:27.957
INTEREST. FURTHER, INSTEAD OF

00:55:28.024 --> 00:55:29.559
REQUIRING THAT THE PUBLIC BE

00:55:29.626 --> 00:55:32.262
ABLE TO REMOTELY HEAR THE

00:55:32.328 --> 00:55:34.230
MEETING AUDIO WITH THE AUDIO,

00:55:34.297 --> 00:55:35.799
OBSERVE THE MEETING AND ADDRESS

00:55:35.865 --> 00:55:38.401
THE BODY AND ATTEND THE MEETING

00:55:38.468 --> 00:55:39.969
WHEN A MEMBER PARTICIPATES

00:55:40.036 --> 00:55:42.005
REMOTELY. THIS BILL ONLY

00:55:42.072 --> 00:55:44.541
REQUIRES THAT THE PUBLIC BE ABLE

00:55:44.607 --> 00:55:46.009
TO REMOTELY DO ONE OF THOSE

00:55:46.076 --> 00:55:48.545
THINGS. CAN YOU IMAGINE

00:55:48.611 --> 00:55:51.481
COMMUNITY MEMBERS SHOWING UP TO

00:55:51.548 --> 00:55:52.515
MEETINGS LIKE THE CALIFORNIA

00:55:52.582 --> 00:55:55.118
PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION,

00:55:55.185 --> 00:55:57.020
CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION,

00:55:57.087 --> 00:55:59.155
AND SEEING MOSTLY AN EMPTY DAIS

00:55:59.222 --> 00:56:02.859
OR AN EMPTY DAIS? OR HOW MUCH

00:56:02.926 --> 00:56:04.828
MORE CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW

00:56:04.894 --> 00:56:06.629
DIFFICULT IT WOULD BE FOR

00:56:06.696 --> 00:56:07.664
COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO APPROACH

00:56:07.731 --> 00:56:09.032
THESE ELECTED AND APPOINTED

00:56:09.099 --> 00:56:11.167
MEMBERS BEFORE OR AFTER

00:56:11.234 --> 00:56:12.268
MEETINGS, SO THAT COMMUNITY

00:56:12.335 --> 00:56:14.070
MEMBERS CAN CONNECT AND HAVE THE

00:56:14.137 --> 00:56:17.073
OPPORTUNITY TO FACE THE ELECTED

00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:19.709
OFFICIALS. FOR THESE REASONS, WE

00:56:19.776 --> 00:56:22.479
MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SB

00:56:22.545 --> 00:56:24.581
SEVEN 4070. WE HOPE TO CONTINUE

00:56:24.647 --> 00:56:25.548
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR'S

00:56:25.615 --> 00:56:27.517
OFFICE AROUND STRIKING THE RIGHT

00:56:27.584 --> 00:56:29.552
BALANCE BETWEEN TRANSPARENCY AND

00:56:29.619 --> 00:56:31.087
THE DESIRE OF GOVERNMENT

00:56:31.154 --> 00:56:33.223
OFFICIALS FOR FLEXIBILITY. THANK

00:56:33.289 --> 00:56:34.257
YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND

00:56:34.324 --> 00:56:36.292
CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU. GOOD

00:56:36.359 --> 00:56:37.360
AFTERNOON, MADAM CHAIR. MEMBERS

00:56:37.427 --> 00:56:38.962
OF THE COMMITTEE, BRITTNEY

00:56:39.028 --> 00:56:40.063
BARSOTTI, ON BEHALF OF THE

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:42.198
CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS

00:56:42.265 --> 00:56:43.199
ASSOCIATION, ALSO HERE, IN

00:56:43.266 --> 00:56:46.202
RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION, WE HAVE

00:56:46.269 --> 00:56:48.037
HAD SO MANY CONVERSATIONS OVER

00:56:48.104 --> 00:56:49.973
THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS ABOUT HOW

00:56:50.039 --> 00:56:51.908
THE PANDEMIC REALLY PUSHED US

00:56:51.975 --> 00:56:54.844
FORWARD IN BEING ABLE TO HAVE

00:56:54.911 --> 00:56:56.412
INCREASED PUBLIC PARTICIPATION

00:56:56.479 --> 00:56:59.883
AND INCREASED OPTIONS FOR REMOTE

00:56:59.949 --> 00:57:01.384
PARTICIPATION. AND TO BE CLEAR,

00:57:01.451 --> 00:57:02.819
THERE IS NOTHING IN THE CURRENT

00:57:02.886 --> 00:57:05.188
LAW THAT PREVENTS ANY BODY,

00:57:05.255 --> 00:57:08.091
STATE, LOCAL WOULD HAVE YOU FROM

00:57:08.158 --> 00:57:10.894
PROVIDING ADDITIONAL PUBLIC

00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:13.897
ACCESS TO THESE MEETINGS. SO, AS

00:57:13.963 --> 00:57:15.665
THE GENTLEMAN FROM THE LITTLE

00:57:15.732 --> 00:57:16.833
HOOVER COMMISSION MENTIONED,

00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:20.203
RIGHT. WE REALLY FOCUS ON THE

00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:23.206
PUBLIC ACCESS, BUT ALSO HAVE

00:57:23.273 --> 00:57:25.141
CONCERNS WITH TOO MUCH

00:57:25.208 --> 00:57:26.776
FLEXIBILITY FOR MEMBERS OF A

00:57:26.843 --> 00:57:30.246
BODY. RESPECTFULLY, CHAIR RUBIO

00:57:30.313 --> 00:57:31.114
HAD AN EXCELLENT BILL A COUPLE

00:57:31.181 --> 00:57:33.616
YEARS AGO DEALING IN THE BROWN

00:57:33.683 --> 00:57:37.654
ACT SPACE CALLED AB 2449. THAT

00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:39.789
IS OUR PREFERRED STRUCTURE. IT

00:57:39.856 --> 00:57:41.858
ALLOWS FOR AN IN-PERSON QUORUM,

00:57:41.925 --> 00:57:45.228
BUT THEN ALSO ALLOWS FOR EXTRA

00:57:45.295 --> 00:57:46.629
FLEXIBILITY FOR THOSE IN

00:57:46.696 --> 00:57:48.731
DIFFERENT SPACES. SO ANYONE WITH

00:57:48.798 --> 00:57:50.333
A DISABILITY, WE'RE VERY GLAD

00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:51.935
THAT THAT IS STILL IN THIS BILL

00:57:52.001 --> 00:57:53.870
CAN PARTICIPATE REMOTELY AND

00:57:53.937 --> 00:57:55.672
COUNT TOWARDS AN IN-PERSON

00:57:55.738 --> 00:57:57.440
QUORUM. ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITIES

00:57:57.507 --> 00:58:00.643
LIKE WHAT WAS TALKED ABOUT

00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:02.946
INCLUDE CAREGIVING NEEDS OR FOR

00:58:03.012 --> 00:58:05.448
A FAMILY OR MEDICAL EMERGENCY,

00:58:05.515 --> 00:58:07.217
THINGS OF THAT NATURE. SO WHILE

00:58:07.283 --> 00:58:08.618
I DON'T WANT TO CONFLATE THE

00:58:08.685 --> 00:58:10.453
BROWN ACT AND THE BAGLEY-KEENE

00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:13.189
ACT, AN OVERALL STRUCTURE THAT

00:58:13.256 --> 00:58:14.724
FOCUSES ON THE IN-PERSON QUORUM

00:58:14.791 --> 00:58:18.061
AND THEN ADDS IN THE ADDITIONAL

00:58:18.127 --> 00:58:19.095
FLEXIBILITY FOR THOSE WHO NEED

00:58:19.162 --> 00:58:21.497
IT, SUCH AS SENIOR CITIZENS OR

00:58:21.564 --> 00:58:24.100
FULL TIME CAREGIVERS, WOULD BE

00:58:24.167 --> 00:58:25.935
THE PREFERENCE. SO THAT IS WHY

00:58:26.002 --> 00:58:27.537
WE ARE HERE IN OPPOSITION, BUT

00:58:27.604 --> 00:58:30.073
COMMIT TO CONTINUING WITH THE

00:58:30.139 --> 00:58:32.475
AUTHOR'S OFFICE TO WORK ON THIS.

00:58:32.542 --> 00:58:35.078
AND YEAH, THANK YOU FOR YOUR

00:58:35.144 --> 00:58:38.248
TIME. THANK YOU. OKAY, ANYONE

ELSE FROM THE AUDIENCE IN

00:58:40.116 --> 00:58:45.321
OPPOSITION? GOOD AFTERNOON,

CHAIR AND MEMBERS, DANNY KENDALL

00:58:47.423 --> 00:58:49.125
KAISER IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION

00:58:49.192 --> 00:58:50.927

00:59:14.317 --> 00:59:16.853
ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE? THANK YOU.

00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:18.621
I'LL BRING IT BACK TO COMMUNITY

00:59:18.688 --> 00:59:20.957
OR I'M SORRY TO COMMITTEE TO

00:59:21.024 --> 00:59:26.863
COMMUNITY TO COMMITTEE. MEMBERS

00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:28.331
FOR QUESTIONS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:59:28.398 --> 00:59:30.767
DIXON. I APPRECIATE THE

00:59:30.833 --> 00:59:31.935
OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THIS BILL

00:59:32.001 --> 00:59:33.770
THAT'S BEING EXTENDED OVER THE

00:59:33.836 --> 00:59:36.005
SUNSET. I HAVING TO HAVE I'LL

00:59:36.072 --> 00:59:37.273
TAKE OFF MY LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAT

00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:40.276
BECAUSE THAT I THINK THAT WAS

00:59:40.343 --> 00:59:41.077
REALLY IT REALLY IS HELPFUL AT

00:59:41.144 --> 00:59:43.246
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL. BUT

00:59:43.313 --> 00:59:46.282
I WILL QUESTION THE DATA THAT

00:59:46.349 --> 00:59:48.151
COMES OUT OF THE PANDEMIC,

00:59:48.217 --> 00:59:51.120
MAINLY BECAUSE PEOPLE DID,

00:59:51.187 --> 00:59:52.121
BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL STUCK AT

00:59:52.188 --> 00:59:53.957
HOME, THEY COULD NOT GO TO THE

00:59:54.023 --> 00:59:55.758
MEETINGS. IT WAS REALLY THE

00:59:55.825 --> 00:59:58.027
OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE WAS

00:59:58.094 --> 00:59:59.395
DEMONSTRATED. THAT'S WHY THE

00:59:59.462 --> 01:00:00.763
NUMBERS AND THE DATA, I'VE NOT

01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:02.699
SEEN THE DATA, HOW THE NUMBERS

01:00:02.765 --> 01:00:03.366
PROBABLY DEMONSTRATED HOW PEOPLE

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:04.667
WHO COULD NOT GO TO THEIR CITY

01:00:04.734 --> 01:00:06.736
HALL OR THEIR STATE AGENCY OR

01:00:06.803 --> 01:00:09.672
REGULATORY BODY TOOK ADVANTAGE

01:00:09.739 --> 01:00:11.641
OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:00:11.708 --> 01:00:14.811
PARTICIPATE OR OBSERVE ONLINE.

01:00:14.877 --> 01:00:18.848
MY CONCERN IS FOR THE PUBLIC IF

01:00:18.915 --> 01:00:20.850
THEY WANT TO HAVE THAT OPTION. I

01:00:20.917 --> 01:00:22.185
THINK THAT DOES HELP THE PEOPLE

01:00:22.251 --> 01:00:24.053
WHO HAVE DISABILITIES AND HAVE

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:25.922
INABILITY TO GET TRANSPORTATION

01:00:25.989 --> 01:00:28.224
TO A MEETING AND AGENCY MEETING.

01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:30.693
I THINK FOR THE MEMBERS WHO ARE

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:32.795
EITHER ELECTED OR APPOINTED,

01:00:32.862 --> 01:00:34.931
PRIMARILY APPOINTED, I GUESS

01:00:34.998 --> 01:00:37.266
HAVE A DUTY AND OBLIGATION. I

01:00:37.333 --> 01:00:39.202
LIKE THE PUC EXAMPLE. YOU SHOW

01:00:39.268 --> 01:00:42.338
UP TO A PUBLIC HEARING BY A

01:00:42.405 --> 01:00:43.973
REGULATORY AGENCY AND IT

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:46.409
DOESN'T. DOES THE BILL REQUIRE

01:00:46.476 --> 01:00:48.011
THAT THE CHAIRPERSON BE PRESENT?

01:00:48.077 --> 01:00:52.615
I JUST THINK THAT THAT MAKES THE

01:00:52.682 --> 01:00:57.420
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS A LITTLE LESS

01:00:57.487 --> 01:01:00.089
A LITTLE TENUOUS. AND I THINK

01:01:00.156 --> 01:01:01.958
PEOPLE ENJOY INTERACTING WITH

01:01:02.025 --> 01:01:04.961
THE OTHER REGULATORY BODY

01:01:05.028 --> 01:01:06.696
MEMBERS. AND I JUST THINK THIS

01:01:06.763 --> 01:01:08.431
DISCOURAGES THAT DEMOCRATIC

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:10.600
INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS AND

01:01:10.666 --> 01:01:12.769
PARTICIPATION. SO MY I WISH THE

01:01:12.835 --> 01:01:15.371
BILL WERE JUST RELATED TO LET

01:01:15.438 --> 01:01:17.507
THE PUBLIC, IF THEY CHOOSE.

01:01:17.573 --> 01:01:19.976
ALTHOUGH I DO THINK JUST ON THAT

01:01:20.043 --> 01:01:21.878
POINT, STUDIES ARE BEGINNING TO

01:01:21.944 --> 01:01:23.613
SHOW IN THE EDUCATION WORLD

01:01:23.679 --> 01:01:25.681
WHICH MAY WHICH MAY HAVE SOME

01:01:25.748 --> 01:01:27.850
APPLICATION TO THIS, THAT

01:01:27.917 --> 01:01:30.820
ATTENTION TO DETAIL AND FOCUS ON

01:01:30.887 --> 01:01:33.823
THE TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION

01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:35.191
THAT'S BEING CONVEYED IN A

01:01:35.258 --> 01:01:38.094
VIRTUAL MEETING IS NOT AS PEOPLE

01:01:38.161 --> 01:01:39.695
ARE NOT CONCENTRATING AS MUCH AS

01:01:39.762 --> 01:01:41.264
THEY WOULD IN PERSON. SO IT'S

01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:42.865
JUST A WHOLE ASPECT OF DEMOCRACY

01:01:42.932 --> 01:01:44.801
AND ENCOURAGING PEOPLE'S

01:01:44.867 --> 01:01:46.803
PARTICIPATION. IF THERE WERE A

01:01:46.869 --> 01:01:49.272
WAY TO AMEND THE BILL AND JUST

01:01:49.338 --> 01:01:50.506
REQUIRE THE PUBLIC, I'D BE OKAY

01:01:50.573 --> 01:01:51.841
WITH THAT. BUT IN THE MEANTIME,

01:01:51.908 --> 01:01:53.443
I THINK IT STILL NEEDS SOME

01:01:53.509 --> 01:01:54.944
WORK. SO THANK YOU. APPRECIATE

01:01:55.011 --> 01:01:57.380
YOUR EFFORTS. THANK YOU. ANYONE

01:01:57.447 --> 01:01:58.448
ELSE IN THE COMMITTEE?

01:01:58.514 --> 01:02:01.684
QUESTIONS? COMMENTS? THANK YOU.

01:02:01.751 --> 01:02:04.921
LET'S SEE. SO, SENATOR LEONARD,

01:02:04.987 --> 01:02:07.590
I APPRECIATE AND I DO WANT TO

01:02:07.657 --> 01:02:08.958
MAKE A COMMENT BECAUSE THE

01:02:09.025 --> 01:02:10.793
SENATOR AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:13.062
ON THIS ISSUE FOR SEVERAL YEARS

01:02:13.129 --> 01:02:14.730
NOW. AND I JUST WANT TO BE

01:02:14.797 --> 01:02:17.633
CLEAR, ONE OF THE PROVISIONS IS

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:19.735
THAT THE CAMERA WOULD HAS TO BE

01:02:19.802 --> 01:02:21.838
ON, CORRECT? YES. OKAY. BECAUSE

01:02:21.904 --> 01:02:23.372
I THINK YOU STATED THAT THAT

01:02:23.439 --> 01:02:25.641
IT'S ONLY THE AUDIO THAT IS NOT

01:02:25.708 --> 01:02:27.343
CORRECT. I THINK ONE OF THE

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:28.845
PROVISIONS OF THE BILL IS THAT

01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:31.714
THE CAMERAS HAVE TO BE ON AT ALL

01:02:31.781 --> 01:02:32.682
TIMES FOR MEMBERS THAT ARE

01:02:32.748 --> 01:02:34.550
PARTICIPATING. AND THEN THE

01:02:34.617 --> 01:02:37.553
OTHER ISSUE, AND I, I KNOW THIS

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:38.821
BECAUSE I WAS THE AUTHOR OF THE

01:02:38.888 --> 01:02:41.824
BROWN ACT BILL, WE WERE VERY

01:02:41.891 --> 01:02:43.126
SPECIFIC. AND I HAD A

01:02:43.192 --> 01:02:44.327
CONVERSATION WITH SENATOR LAIRD

01:02:44.393 --> 01:02:45.962
ABOUT DOING THIS IN TANDEM, NOT

01:02:46.028 --> 01:02:49.298
TO HAVE CONFLICTING POLICIES.

01:02:49.365 --> 01:02:50.766
BUT THE OTHER REQUIREMENT IS

01:02:50.833 --> 01:02:53.369
THAT YOU MUST HAVE A QUORUM

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:55.738
PRESENT IN ORDER FOR THE PUBLIC

01:02:55.805 --> 01:02:57.540
FOR THE REMOTE PARTICIPATION. SO

01:02:57.607 --> 01:03:01.477
TO THE QUESTION FROM I DIDN'T

01:03:01.544 --> 01:03:04.680
FROM ACLU, IS WE ARE REQUIRING

01:03:04.747 --> 01:03:06.115
THAT THERE BE A QUORUM PRESENT

01:03:06.182 --> 01:03:08.050
AND THEN THE OTHER MEMBERS CAN

01:03:08.117 --> 01:03:11.654
PARTICIPATE REMOTELY. AND THE WE

01:03:11.721 --> 01:03:13.723
FOUND THAT THE PANDEMIC ENDED

01:03:13.789 --> 01:03:16.058
WELL, YOU KNOW, ENDED. AND WE

01:03:16.125 --> 01:03:19.128
HAVE HAD MORE PARTICIPATION. THE

01:03:19.195 --> 01:03:22.798
THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS WHY WE

01:03:22.865 --> 01:03:26.068
DECIDED TO GO THIS ROUTE

01:03:26.135 --> 01:03:27.870
SPECIFICALLY FOR THE ADDRESSES,

01:03:27.937 --> 01:03:28.871
PUBLISHING THE ADDRESSES. I

01:03:28.938 --> 01:03:30.072
DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR,

01:03:30.139 --> 01:03:31.908
BUT THE BROWN ACT REQUIRES THAT

01:03:31.974 --> 01:03:34.911
IF SOMEBODY, A MEMBER OF ANYBODY

01:03:34.977 --> 01:03:38.614
HAS TO DISCLOSE THE ADDRESS. THE

01:03:38.681 --> 01:03:39.916
REASON THAT WE STARTED THIS

01:03:39.982 --> 01:03:41.817
PROCESS FOR THE BROWN ACT WAS

01:03:41.884 --> 01:03:43.953
BECAUSE THERE WERE SOME STALKING

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:45.855
AND SOME DANGEROUS SITUATIONS

01:03:45.922 --> 01:03:47.857
GOING ON FOR A COUPLE OF MEMBERS

01:03:47.924 --> 01:03:50.826
OF MY, SOME OF MY BOARDS. AND SO

01:03:50.893 --> 01:03:53.262
PUBLISHING THE ADDRESS WAS THE

01:03:53.329 --> 01:03:55.665
ISSUE. IF THEY'RE AWAY FROM, YOU

01:03:55.731 --> 01:03:57.800
KNOW, FROM, FROM, FROM HOME,

01:03:57.867 --> 01:03:59.068
YOU'RE JUST IF YOU'RE AT A

01:03:59.135 --> 01:04:00.203
CONFERENCE, FOR EXAMPLE, AND

01:04:00.269 --> 01:04:02.672
YOU'RE AT A HOTEL OR A RANDOM

01:04:02.738 --> 01:04:04.507
RESTAURANT, THEN WHOEVER WAS

01:04:04.574 --> 01:04:06.409
STALKING THAT MEMBER WOULD SHOW

01:04:06.475 --> 01:04:08.878
UP. AND SO WE WERE VERY

01:04:08.945 --> 01:04:10.780
INTENTIONAL ABOUT, YOU KNOW,

01:04:10.846 --> 01:04:12.114
THAT IN THE BROWN ACT. AND I

01:04:12.181 --> 01:04:13.916
KNOW THAT SENATOR LAIRD AND I

01:04:13.983 --> 01:04:17.687
WORKED ON THIS. YOU HAVE TO

01:04:17.753 --> 01:04:19.522
THERE'S A LIMITED AMOUNT OF

01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:21.490
TIMES THAT YOU CAN DO THE REMOTE

01:04:21.557 --> 01:04:22.925
PARTICIPATION. AND SO WE DID

01:04:22.992 --> 01:04:24.427
WORK ON THESE, AND BECAUSE OF

01:04:24.493 --> 01:04:26.429
THE WORK THAT SENATOR LAIRD DID

01:04:26.495 --> 01:04:28.397
AND THE COMMITTEE DID, THE

01:04:28.464 --> 01:04:30.933
COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS DID, I'M

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.335
COMFORTABLE MOVING FORWARD WITH

01:04:32.401 --> 01:04:34.737
THE BILL. BUT AGAIN, I JUST WANT

01:04:34.804 --> 01:04:36.706
TO STRESS THAT THERE HAS TO BE A

01:04:36.772 --> 01:04:38.007
QUORUM. AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE

01:04:38.074 --> 01:04:40.276
THAT WAS A STICKING POINT FOR ME

01:04:40.343 --> 01:04:41.677
WHEN I WAS WORKING WITH WITH THE

01:04:41.744 --> 01:04:44.080
FOLKS THAT NEEDED THE, THE, THE

01:04:44.146 --> 01:04:45.481
BILL. SO JUST WANTED TO POINT

01:04:45.548 --> 01:04:48.417
THAT OUT BECAUSE WE HAVE DONE

01:04:48.484 --> 01:04:50.620
THAT WORK PREVIOUS TO THIS. THIS

01:04:50.686 --> 01:04:51.887
IS JUST AN EXTENSION OF THE WORK

01:04:51.954 --> 01:04:54.457
THAT WE HAD ALREADY DONE. THANK

01:04:54.523 --> 01:04:56.859
YOU. AND WITH THAT, MADAM

01:04:56.926 --> 01:04:58.761
SECRETARY, I NEED A MOTION AND A

01:04:58.828 --> 01:05:00.730
SECOND. OH, SENATOR LAIRD, YOU

01:05:00.796 --> 01:05:03.332
MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU. AND I WANT

01:05:03.399 --> 01:05:04.567
TO TAKE JUST BASICALLY WHAT YOU

01:05:04.634 --> 01:05:07.136
SAID IS CLOSE AND ADD A COUPLE

01:05:07.203 --> 01:05:08.371
OF THINGS, BECAUSE YOU DID MAKE

01:05:08.437 --> 01:05:10.940
THE CORRECTION THAT YOU CANNOT

01:05:11.007 --> 01:05:12.908
TURN THE CAMERA OFF. THE OTHER

01:05:12.975 --> 01:05:14.710
CORRECTION I WOULD MAKE IS IT

01:05:14.777 --> 01:05:16.912
WAS SAID SOMEBODY WOULD COME AND

01:05:16.979 --> 01:05:18.748
FACE AN EMPTY DAIS. YOU HAVE TO

01:05:18.814 --> 01:05:20.683
HAVE A MAJORITY IN PERSON. YOU

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:23.452
WOULD NEVER FACE AN EMPTY DAIS

01:05:23.519 --> 01:05:25.288
WHEN THAT HAPPENS. AND LASTLY, I

01:05:25.354 --> 01:05:27.723
WOULD JUST REMIND YOU THAT THIS

01:05:27.790 --> 01:05:30.893
LEAVES THE OPTION FOR THE BODY

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:33.162
TO GO WITH THE CURRENT LAW, TO

01:05:33.229 --> 01:05:35.197
NOT SUBSTITUTE THIS, TO GO WITH

01:05:35.264 --> 01:05:38.200
THE CURRENT LAW. AND SOME HAVE.

01:05:38.267 --> 01:05:40.970
SO I THINK THAT IT IS JUST

01:05:41.037 --> 01:05:43.239
WORKED, AND THE FEARS THAT

01:05:43.306 --> 01:05:45.441
PEOPLE HAVE HAD HAVE NOT

01:05:45.508 --> 01:05:46.709
MATERIALIZED. BUT WE HAVE A

01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:48.811
SUNSET AND IN IN FIVE YEARS WE

01:05:48.878 --> 01:05:51.080
CAN ASSESS THAT AGAIN. WITH

01:05:51.147 --> 01:05:52.948
THAT, I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN

01:05:53.015 --> 01:05:55.584
I VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR. SO

01:05:55.651 --> 01:06:00.823

DIXON. HI, SENATOR. JUST A QUICK

01:13:45.587 --> 01:13:46.588

IT'LL SUNSET AFTER SEVEN YEARS.

01:13:51.627 --> 01:13:52.928

01:13:55.397 --> 01:13:58.100

NOW, IF THEY GET ONE OF THESE

01:14:00.068 --> 01:14:01.804
LICENSES WHEN THEY'RE LET'S SAY

01:14:01.870 --> 01:14:04.139
THEY CLOSE, THEY WOULD GO BACK

01:14:04.206 --> 01:14:06.508
AND THEN BE RE LOTTERY. OH IT

01:14:06.575 --> 01:14:08.877
DOESN'T STAY WITH THE LAND. NO

01:14:08.944 --> 01:14:10.746
IT STAYS WITH THE BUSINESS. AND

01:14:10.813 --> 01:14:12.314
THAT'S WHY WE'RE CAPPING IT.

01:14:12.381 --> 01:14:13.715
IT'S THE BASIC FEE THAT THEY

01:14:13.782 --> 01:14:16.185
PAY. SO THEY CAN'T SELL IT ON

01:14:16.251 --> 01:14:17.219
THE SECONDARY MARKET. OH THAT'S

01:14:17.286 --> 01:14:18.754

200,000 FOR A LIQUOR LICENSE.

01:14:29.498 --> 01:14:30.799
AND ONE OTHER QUESTION IS, I

01:14:30.866 --> 01:14:33.001

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:40.275
SUPPORTS IT. I DON'T KNOW THE I

01:14:40.342 --> 01:14:41.677
MEAN, THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS

01:14:41.743 --> 01:14:43.912
BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF DOWNTOWN

01:14:43.979 --> 01:14:44.680
REVITALIZATION, AND THIS WOULD

01:14:44.746 --> 01:14:47.015
HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE BOARD OF

01:14:49.751 --> 01:14:50.919
HAVE THEY DONE A RESOLUTION? I

01:14:50.986 --> 01:14:53.255
DON'T KNOW THAT THEY'VE DONE A

01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:54.256
RESOLUTION. OUR SUPERVISOR DOES.

01:14:54.323 --> 01:14:56.158
WE TALK REGULARLY, AND USUALLY

01:14:56.225 --> 01:14:57.726
THE POLICE WEIGH IN ON THESE

01:14:57.793 --> 01:15:00.495
KINDS OF THINGS. WHEN THIS WOULD

01:15:00.562 --> 01:15:01.763
GO THROUGH THE BOARD OF

01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:02.865
SUPERVISORS, IF THE POLICE HAD

01:15:02.931 --> 01:15:04.399
INPUT, THEY WOULD PROVIDE INPUT

01:15:04.466 --> 01:15:06.134

FORMER REDEVELOPMENT AREAS

01:31:12.967 --> 01:31:14.602

DISPLAYS AND OTHER AREAS.

01:31:15.503 --> 01:31:16.971
BECAUSE OF THE SPECIAL ECONOMIC

HARDSHIP THAT EXISTS IN THOSE

THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE, IT IS

01:31:41.796 --> 01:31:43.865
IMPORTANT TO PASS THIS BILL.

01:31:43.931 --> 01:31:45.700
THIS BILL IS A REASONABLE

01:31:45.766 --> 01:31:46.767
APPROACH TO HELP SUPPORT OUR

01:31:46.834 --> 01:31:48.636
LOCAL COMMUNITIES, WHICH IS WHY

01:31:48.703 --> 01:31:50.438

01:31:50.504 --> 01:31:53.140

STORES. WE HAVE ONE SIGN IN THE

01:32:19.033 --> 01:32:20.735
CITY OF GLENDORA, AND I THINK

01:32:20.801 --> 01:32:21.402
THE SERGEANTS WERE KIND ENOUGH

01:32:21.469 --> 01:32:23.004
TO PASS AROUND A MAP SHOWING

01:32:23.070 --> 01:32:25.106
WHERE IT IS, BUT THIS IS NEXT TO

01:32:25.172 --> 01:32:26.340
AN ELEVATED FREEWAY. THE SIGN

01:32:26.407 --> 01:32:27.742
WAS CONSTRUCTED OVER 20 YEARS

01:32:27.808 --> 01:32:29.277
AGO THROUGH REDEVELOPMENT. IT

01:32:29.343 --> 01:32:31.445
SERVED A VERY VITAL PURPOSE.

01:32:31.512 --> 01:32:32.713
WITHOUT THE SIGN, NOBODY WOULD

01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:34.282
EVEN KNOW THIS SHOPPING MARKET

01:32:34.348 --> 01:32:36.083
EXISTS. WE'D LIKE TO FIND A

01:32:36.150 --> 01:32:39.086
PERMANENT SOLUTION, AND WE'VE

01:32:39.153 --> 01:32:41.622
HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH CALTRANS.

01:32:41.689 --> 01:32:43.257
WE'RE LOOKING FOR A LITTLE BIT

01:32:43.324 --> 01:32:44.759
MORE HELP, BUT WITHOUT AN

01:32:44.825 --> 01:32:45.326
EXTENSION, THEY'RE GOING TO

01:32:45.393 --> 01:32:47.662
FORCE US TO TEAR THIS SIGN DOWN

01:32:47.728 --> 01:32:48.729
AT A SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE ON

01:32:48.796 --> 01:32:50.631
JANUARY 1ST OF THIS NEXT YEAR.

01:32:50.698 --> 01:32:51.966
SO WE NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:32:52.033 --> 01:32:54.201
TIME TO COME UP WITH A LONGER

01:32:54.268 --> 01:32:56.504

01:32:56.570 --> 01:32:57.071

01:32:57.138 --> 01:32:58.472

DRIVING BY, YOU WILL MISS THE

01:33:11.953 --> 01:33:13.321

ADVERTISING DISPLAY FOR THEM IS

01:33:15.056 --> 01:33:16.290
VITAL FOR NOT ONLY THE

01:33:16.357 --> 01:33:17.191
BUSINESSES IN THE COMMUNITY, BUT

01:33:17.258 --> 01:33:19.060
FOR THE COMMUNITY ITSELF. SO FOR

01:33:19.126 --> 01:33:21.095
THOSE REASONS, WE WOULD LIKE TO

01:33:21.162 --> 01:33:21.896

01:33:55.830 --> 01:33:57.431
ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN

01:33:57.498 --> 01:34:13.347
OPPOSITION?

01:34:13.414 --> 01:34:14.949
WE'RE GOING TO MOVE OVER TO THIS

01:34:15.016 --> 01:34:16.250
SIDE. GOOD AFTERNOON, MADAM

01:34:16.317 --> 01:34:17.952
CHAIR AND MEMBERS. STEVE CRUZ,

01:34:18.019 --> 01:34:18.919
ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:34:18.986 --> 01:34:21.022
STATE OUTDOOR ADVERTISING

01:34:21.088 --> 01:34:23.457
ASSOCIATION. AND WE REPRESENT

01:34:23.524 --> 01:34:25.659
90% OF THE BILLBOARD COMPANIES

01:34:25.726 --> 01:34:26.861
THAT HAVE SIGNS IN AND AROUND

01:34:26.927 --> 01:34:29.196
THE STATE HIGHWAYS. REGRETTABLY,

01:34:29.263 --> 01:34:31.298
WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THE

01:34:31.365 --> 01:34:33.834
SENATOR'S BILL, AND OUR PRIMARY

01:34:33.901 --> 01:34:35.770
CONCERNS ARE ARE TWO

01:34:35.836 --> 01:34:38.873
FUNDAMENTALLY, ONE IS UNFAIR

01:34:38.939 --> 01:34:40.674
MARKET ADVANTAGE THAT THE STATE

01:34:40.741 --> 01:34:43.611
DOES REQUIRE A GREAT DEAL OF

01:34:43.677 --> 01:34:46.147
REGULATIONS FOR THE PLACEMENT OF

01:34:46.213 --> 01:34:48.315
BILLBOARDS ALONG STATE HIGHWAYS

01:34:48.382 --> 01:34:50.418
WITH RESPECT TO ENSURING SAFETY,

01:34:50.484 --> 01:34:52.153
ESTHETIC PRESERVATION AND

01:34:52.219 --> 01:34:53.687
COMMUNITY STANDARDS. SO

01:34:53.754 --> 01:34:55.523
EXTENDING THE LIFESPAN OF THE

01:34:55.589 --> 01:34:56.390
REDEVELOPMENT SIGNS THAT ARE OUT

01:34:56.457 --> 01:34:59.093
OF COMPLIANCE CLEARLY CREATES AN

01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:00.494
ADVANTAGE FOR NON-COMPLIANT

01:35:00.561 --> 01:35:02.396
BILLBOARD OPERATORS. THE SECOND

01:35:02.463 --> 01:35:04.198
ISSUE, AS A RESULT OF THAT

01:35:04.265 --> 01:35:04.999
NONCOMPLIANCE IS WHAT I THINK

01:35:05.066 --> 01:35:06.333
YOU'VE HEARD BEFORE, BUT IS

01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:07.835
MAYBE MORE SERIOUS IN THIS DAY

01:35:07.902 --> 01:35:10.271
AND AGE, IS THAT THE SIGNS THAT

01:35:10.337 --> 01:35:12.306
ARE NON-COMPLIANT ARE ALSO OUT

01:35:12.373 --> 01:35:13.441
OF COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL

01:35:13.507 --> 01:35:19.380
HIGHWAY BEAUTIFICATION ACT, AND

01:35:19.447 --> 01:35:20.848
THE REPERCUSSIONS FOR THAT COULD

01:35:20.915 --> 01:35:22.116
BE THE LOSS OF 10% OF FEDERAL

01:35:22.183 --> 01:35:23.717
HIGHWAY DOLLARS. AND OBVIOUSLY,

01:35:23.784 --> 01:35:25.019
GIVEN THE UNPREDICTABLE NATURE

01:35:25.086 --> 01:35:26.020
OF WHAT'S HAPPENING, OBVIOUSLY

01:35:26.087 --> 01:35:26.821
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE WANT

01:35:26.887 --> 01:35:28.355
TO CONTINUE TO CHANCE. WE DO

01:35:28.422 --> 01:35:30.458
APPRECIATE THE CHAIR AND THE

01:35:30.524 --> 01:35:31.959
AUTHOR'S WILLINGNESS TO TRY TO

01:35:32.026 --> 01:35:34.095
LIMIT THE EXPOSURE THERE FROM 4

01:35:34.161 --> 01:35:35.729
TO 3 YEARS. AND ONE OF THE

01:35:35.796 --> 01:35:37.264
THINGS THAT WE DID WANT TO

01:35:37.331 --> 01:35:38.666
EMPHASIZE, AND WE HOPE CAN

01:35:38.732 --> 01:35:41.268
HAPPEN AS PART OF THIS, IS TO

01:35:41.335 --> 01:35:43.504
REALLY TAKE A LOOK AT, I THINK

01:35:43.571 --> 01:35:45.072
THERE'S ABOUT 40 OR SO IN THE

01:35:45.139 --> 01:35:45.973
CONSULTANT WOULD KNOW FOR SURE,

01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:48.075
DISPLAYS THAT ARE OUT THERE THAN

01:35:48.142 --> 01:35:49.443
THESE FORMER REDEVELOPMENT AREAS

01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:51.779
IS TO HAVE CALTRANS TAKE A LOOK

01:35:51.846 --> 01:35:54.281
AT THEM. AND WHY ARE THEY

01:35:54.348 --> 01:35:54.949
NON-COMPLIANT AND WHAT WOULD IT

01:35:55.015 --> 01:35:55.649
TAKE? THERE'S A MAXIMUM

01:35:55.716 --> 01:35:56.684
ALLOWABLE SQUARE FOOTAGE FOR A

01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:58.185
DISPLAY, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT WE

01:35:58.252 --> 01:35:59.687
HAVE TO LIVE WITH. BUT DO YOU

01:35:59.753 --> 01:36:02.656
HAVE TO REDUCE THE SIZE? IS IT A

01:36:02.723 --> 01:36:03.724
SPACING ISSUE? THEN WHAT WOULD

01:36:03.791 --> 01:36:05.459
IT TAKE TO DO THAT? IT'S NOT

01:36:05.526 --> 01:36:06.861
IMPOSSIBLE. AND SO WE WOULD HOPE

01:36:06.927 --> 01:36:08.429
TO TRY TO WORK WITH THE

01:36:08.496 --> 01:36:10.764
COMMITTEE TO SEE IF DURING THIS

01:36:10.831 --> 01:36:12.833
PERIOD THAT THERE COULD BE SOME

01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:14.802
REALLY SOME MEANINGFUL ACTIONS

01:36:14.869 --> 01:36:16.537
SORT OF TAKEN TO KIND OF BRING

01:36:16.604 --> 01:36:17.771
THESE INTO COMPLIANCE FOR THE

01:36:17.838 --> 01:36:19.006
REASONS THAT I SHARED. AND RON

WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE

OUTDOOR ADVERTISING, OUTDOOR

01:37:30.077 --> 01:37:33.113
ADVERTISING ASSOCIATION. THIS, I

01:37:33.180 --> 01:37:34.982
FEEL, WAS A COMPROMISE. AFTER

01:37:35.049 --> 01:37:38.919
WORKING WITH THE SENATOR AND THE

01:37:38.986 --> 01:37:40.721
SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL, I

01:37:40.788 --> 01:37:41.789
THOUGHT THAT THIS MIGHT BE A

01:37:41.855 --> 01:37:43.891
GOOD COMPROMISE FOR THE MOMENT,

01:37:43.958 --> 01:37:46.827
AS YOU KNOW, AND WE'VE DEALT

01:37:46.894 --> 01:37:48.662
WITH THE CALTRANS. IT'S A VERY

01:37:48.729 --> 01:37:50.264
DIFFICULT PROCESS. AND SO I

01:37:50.331 --> 01:37:54.268
THINK THIS WILL GIVE THE

01:37:54.335 --> 01:37:55.436
BILLBOARDS THAT ARE NOT IN

01:37:55.502 --> 01:37:56.670
COMPLIANCE OR THAT ARE TRYING TO

01:37:56.737 --> 01:37:58.005
GET INTO COMPLIANCE AN

01:37:58.072 --> 01:37:58.806
OPPORTUNITY TO FIX IT. AND

01:37:58.872 --> 01:38:01.508
THAT'S WHY WE DID REDUCE THE

01:38:01.575 --> 01:38:03.677
YEARS FROM 4 TO 3. THAT AT LEAST

01:38:03.744 --> 01:38:07.014
WILL BE SOME KIND OF A IN

01:38:07.081 --> 01:38:08.782
BETWEEN TIME FRAME. SO I REALLY

01:38:08.849 --> 01:38:10.084
APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING

01:38:10.150 --> 01:38:11.185
