OFFICER, PROUD SUPPORTER OF

00:43:48.826 --> 00:43:50.794
SENATE BILL 27. SO THE HOPE OF

00:43:50.861 --> 00:43:52.329
THE CARE ACT PROGRAM WAS TO

00:43:52.396 --> 00:43:55.132
PREVENT AVOIDABLE PSYCHIATRIC

00:43:55.199 --> 00:43:56.600

IMPLEMENTATION IS GOING TO MATCH

00:44:05.576 --> 00:44:07.778
THE HOPE OF THE CARE ACT, WE

00:44:07.845 --> 00:44:09.113
MUST ADDRESS THE HIGH PERCENTAGE

00:44:09.179 --> 00:44:11.782
OF CARE ACT PETITION DISMISSALS

00:44:11.849 --> 00:44:14.618
RECENTLY REPORTED THAT 62% OF

00:44:14.685 --> 00:44:16.420
FAMILY PETITIONS WERE DISMISSED.

00:44:16.487 --> 00:44:18.355
WHAT ARE THE REASONS? THE STATE

00:44:18.422 --> 00:44:20.357
BAR AFFIRMED THAT 19% OF

00:44:20.424 --> 00:44:22.326
PETITION DISMISSALS WERE RELATED

00:44:22.393 --> 00:44:23.794
TO THE RESPONDENT'S ENROLLMENT,

00:44:23.861 --> 00:44:25.029
OR LIKELY ENROLLMENT IN

00:44:25.095 --> 00:44:26.864
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT. AN

00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:29.199
ADDITIONAL 7% WERE DISMISSED

00:44:29.266 --> 00:44:30.501
BECAUSE THE INDIVIDUAL WAS

00:44:30.567 --> 00:44:31.902
ALREADY STABILIZED, AND ONGOING

00:44:31.969 --> 00:44:33.804
VOLUNTARY TREATMENT FOR

00:44:33.871 --> 00:44:35.139
RESPONDENTS WHO WERE ALREADY

00:44:35.205 --> 00:44:36.774
ENROLLED IN TREATMENT PRIOR TO

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:38.008
PETITION FILING. WHY WOULD

00:44:38.075 --> 00:44:39.977
PEOPLE TAKE THE TIME AND EFFORT

00:44:40.044 --> 00:44:41.678
TO COMPLETE THESE PETITIONS WHEN

00:44:41.745 --> 00:44:43.447
EVERYTHING IS FINE? WHEN

00:44:43.514 --> 00:44:45.282
TESTIFYING LAST WEEK BEFORE THE

ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, I

00:44:47.184 --> 00:44:49.219
MENTIONED AN INDIVIDUAL WITH A

00:44:49.286 --> 00:44:51.321
PENDING CARE PETITION. THEY

00:44:51.388 --> 00:44:53.223
HAVEN'T CHANGED THEIR CLOTHES IN

00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:54.925
OVER A YEAR. THEY REQUIRE

00:44:54.992 --> 00:44:57.094
PROMPTING TO EAT. THEY REFUSE TO

00:44:57.161 --> 00:44:59.029
MOVE TO A MORE SUPPORTED SETTING

00:44:59.096 --> 00:45:01.198
DUE TO PARANOIA. I JUST LEARNED

00:45:01.265 --> 00:45:03.200
THAT THEIR CARE PETITION WAS

00:45:03.267 --> 00:45:04.568
DISMISSED BECAUSE THE PATIENT IS

00:45:04.635 --> 00:45:06.170
ALREADY ENROLLED IN AN ACT

00:45:06.236 --> 00:45:08.939
PROGRAM. SB 27TH MAY DECREASE

00:45:09.006 --> 00:45:11.241
THESE DISMISSAL RATES BY

00:45:11.308 --> 00:45:12.676
CLARIFYING THAT CLINICALLY

00:45:12.743 --> 00:45:14.011
STABILIZED AND ONGOING VOLUNTARY

00:45:14.078 --> 00:45:16.513
TREATMENT MEANS THE PERSON IS

00:45:24.288 --> 00:45:24.855
PART. ENROLLMENT AND TREATMENT

VOLUNTARY TREATMENT, IT MUST

00:45:30.661 --> 00:45:33.564
MEAN MORE. SO SENATE BILL 27

00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:35.099
CREATES CLARITY SO INDIVIDUALS

00:45:35.165 --> 00:45:37.201

YOUR SUPPORT, WE CAN THANK YOU.

00:45:44.141 --> 00:45:45.142

00:46:44.735 --> 00:46:47.004
DEFINES IT, HER PARTICIPATION IS

00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:48.438
COMPLETELY VOLUNTARY, AND EVEN

00:46:48.505 --> 00:46:50.207
THOUGH IT MAY TAKE SEVERAL

00:46:50.274 --> 00:46:51.642

TIME, EVERY RELAPSE WAS NOT

00:47:26.343 --> 00:47:27.544
IMMEDIATE. THAT WAS NOT

00:47:27.611 --> 00:47:28.946
IMMEDIATELY TREATED, TOOK HER

LONGER TO RECOVER, AND REPEATED

00:47:31.281 --> 00:47:33.317

00:47:33.383 --> 00:47:34.818
DIFFICULTY IN REGAINING HER

00:47:34.885 --> 00:47:37.020
FUNCTIONAL, COGNITIVE AND

MOTIVATIONAL ABILITIES. I FEEL

00:47:39.556 --> 00:47:41.191
SAD TO SIT HERE AND REPORT THAT

00:47:41.258 --> 00:47:43.493
WE, HER FAMILY, FEEL LUCKY TO

HAVE THE DIAGNOSIS OF

INDIVIDUALS. I SUPPORT SB 27

00:48:00.143 --> 00:48:02.179
BECAUSE IT APPROPRIATELY EXTENDS

00:48:02.246 --> 00:48:03.513
TO OTHER DIAGNOSES WITH

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:05.749

TRIED EVERY OTHER LEVEL OF CARE

00:48:16.693 --> 00:48:18.061

00:50:57.888 --> 00:50:59.189

BEHEST OF THE COURT TO GET THEM

00:51:35.225 --> 00:51:38.428

IMPLEMENTING THE ACT. THEY HAVE

00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:49.473
NOTED THAT A POSITIVE IMPACT OF

00:51:49.539 --> 00:51:51.842
THIS POLICY HAS BEEN THAT IT

00:51:51.908 --> 00:51:52.976
ALLOWS MORE PEOPLE IN OUR

00:51:53.043 --> 00:51:54.478

00:52:35.785 --> 00:52:38.221
NEEDS ARE MORE INTENSIVE. AND

00:52:38.288 --> 00:52:39.789
WHILE IT'S TRUE THAT TO DATE

00:52:39.856 --> 00:52:42.292
CARE PLANS HAVE NOT REACHED THE

00:52:42.359 --> 00:52:44.995
ESTIMATES THAT WE ALL IMAGINED

00:52:45.061 --> 00:52:46.930
WE WOULD HAVE, WE ARE SUFFERING

00:52:46.997 --> 00:52:48.431
FROM THE SAME PARADOX THAT

00:52:48.498 --> 00:52:51.268
PLAGUES PROGRAMS LIKE AOT. THAT

00:52:51.334 --> 00:52:53.436
IS OUR MOST SUCCESSFUL FORMS OF

00:52:53.503 --> 00:52:55.238
ENGAGEMENT. GETTING PEOPLE INTO

00:52:55.305 --> 00:52:57.507
VOLUNTARY SERVICES WITHOUT

00:52:57.574 --> 00:52:59.142
INVOLVING COURTS OR FORMAL

00:52:59.209 --> 00:53:00.610
ORDERS, AND RESPECTING THEIR

00:53:00.677 --> 00:53:02.279
PRIVACY AND DIGNITY, MEANS THAT

00:53:02.345 --> 00:53:04.080
OUR BIGGEST SUCCESS STORIES

00:53:04.147 --> 00:53:05.949
CAN'T BE TALLIED AND TALKED

00:53:06.016 --> 00:53:08.151
ABOUT. COUNTIES HAVE FAITHFULLY

00:53:08.218 --> 00:53:10.387
IMPLEMENTED CARE COURT IN ALL 58

00:53:10.453 --> 00:53:11.588
COUNTIES, AND THE VAST MAJORITY

00:53:11.655 --> 00:53:13.456
OF OUR SUCCESS STORIES ARE THOSE

00:53:13.523 --> 00:53:16.026
PEOPLE WHO SAY YES AT THE FIRST

00:53:16.092 --> 00:53:17.827
OFFER. THE STATE HAS UPDATED ITS

00:53:17.894 --> 00:53:18.962
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, SO

00:53:19.029 --> 00:53:21.164
FUTURE REPORTS WILL ATTEMPT TO

00:53:21.231 --> 00:53:23.400
QUANTIFY VOLUNTARY ENGAGEMENT.

00:53:23.466 --> 00:53:25.135
AND THE LEGISLATURE, IN ITS

00:53:25.201 --> 00:53:26.036
FORESIGHT, ASKED FOR A STATE

00:53:26.102 --> 00:53:27.971
AUDITOR'S IMPACT OF THE CARE

00:53:28.038 --> 00:53:30.307
COURT PROGRAM. WE'RE EXTREMELY

00:53:30.373 --> 00:53:31.841
CONCERNED THAT WITH THE URGENCY

00:53:31.908 --> 00:53:34.477
CLAUSE, WE WILL NOT HAVE TIME TO

00:53:34.544 --> 00:53:37.714
GET OUR SERVICES UP TO THE SCALE

00:53:37.781 --> 00:53:39.849
NECESSARY, AND THE COURTS WILL

00:53:39.916 --> 00:53:41.217
NOT HAVE A CHANCE TO UPDATE

00:53:41.284 --> 00:53:43.420
RULES, TRAIN JUDICIAL OFFICERS

00:53:43.486 --> 00:53:46.222
OR WORK WITH US TO BUDGET,

00:53:46.289 --> 00:53:47.324
RECRUIT AND HIRE THE STAFF

00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:49.292
NEEDED TO EXPAND OUR WORKFORCE.

00:53:49.359 --> 00:53:51.061
WHEN PEOPLE ARE BROUGHT IN, WE

00:53:51.127 --> 00:53:53.430
HAVE A PROMISE AND WE HOPE TO

00:53:53.496 --> 00:53:59.636
MEET THAT. THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

00:53:59.703 --> 00:54:02.138
HELLO. OKAY. MY NAME IS DOCTOR

00:54:02.205 --> 00:54:04.474
LYNN MÀ RIVAS. I AM THE

00:54:04.541 --> 00:54:06.176
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE

00:54:06.242 --> 00:54:07.510
CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF MENTAL

00:54:07.577 --> 00:54:09.679
HEALTH PEER RUN ORGANIZATIONS.

00:54:09.746 --> 00:54:11.247
I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE

00:54:11.314 --> 00:54:12.148
INTERESTS AND VALUES OF THE

00:54:12.215 --> 00:54:14.150
MENTAL HEALTH CONSUMER

00:54:14.217 --> 00:54:15.752
COMMUNITY. I'M ALSO A

00:54:15.819 --> 00:54:16.853
REPRESENTATIVE OF THAT

00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:19.489
COMMUNITY, AS I MYSELF HAVE MY

00:54:19.556 --> 00:54:22.692
BIPOLAR DISORDER ONE, AND AT ONE

00:54:22.759 --> 00:54:25.161
TIME I EXPERIENCED PSYCHOSIS. I

00:54:25.228 --> 00:54:26.763
BELONGED TO THE SPECIFIC

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:28.098
POPULATION BEING DISCUSSED HERE

00:54:28.164 --> 00:54:30.900
TODAY, UNDERLYING THE SO-CALLED

00:54:30.967 --> 00:54:33.269
CARE IN CARE COURT IS A COERCIVE

00:54:33.336 --> 00:54:35.672
LEGAL PROCESS THAT CAN END IN

00:54:35.739 --> 00:54:38.174
CONSERVATORSHIP AND INVOLUNTARY

00:54:38.241 --> 00:54:38.742
INSTITUTIONALIZATION IF YOU

00:54:38.808 --> 00:54:41.044
DON'T COOPERATE. AND THE

00:54:41.111 --> 00:54:42.412
ULTIMATE IRONY IS THAT CARE

00:54:42.479 --> 00:54:43.480
COURT DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY

00:54:43.546 --> 00:54:45.382
SUPPORTS FOR THE INDIVIDUALS

00:54:45.448 --> 00:54:47.517
TARGETED. THERE IS LITERALLY NO

00:54:47.584 --> 00:54:50.387
CARE IN CARE COURT BEFORE YOU

00:54:50.453 --> 00:54:51.755
INVEST MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

00:54:51.821 --> 00:54:54.424
EXPANDING THE SYSTEM, I ASK YOU,

00:54:54.491 --> 00:54:57.293
WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE? DOES IT

00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:58.595
REALLY GUIDE A PERSON DOWN THE

00:54:58.662 --> 00:55:00.930
ROAD OF MENTAL HEALTH RECOVERY?

00:55:00.997 --> 00:55:04.334
I DOUBT IT. ALSO, WHOSE

00:55:04.401 --> 00:55:05.902
INTERESTS ARE YOU PURSUING WITH

00:55:05.969 --> 00:55:08.071
THIS BILL? I CAN TELL YOU THAT

00:55:08.138 --> 00:55:09.939
IT IS NOT OURS. THESE ARE NOT

00:55:10.006 --> 00:55:11.775
THE SERVICES WE WANT YOU TO

00:55:11.841 --> 00:55:14.477
INVEST IN. RATHER, WE WANT YOU

00:55:14.544 --> 00:55:14.978
TO INVEST IN COMMUNITY

00:55:15.045 --> 00:55:16.279
ORGANIZATIONS RUN BY PEERS THAT

00:55:16.346 --> 00:55:18.181
PROVIDE SUPPORT, HOPE AND

00:55:18.248 --> 00:55:20.250
COMMUNITY. NONE OF THE EVIDENCE

00:55:20.316 --> 00:55:22.052
SUPPORTS INVOLUNTARY MEASURES.

00:55:22.118 --> 00:55:24.554
RATHER, CHOICE IS A KEY

00:55:24.621 --> 00:55:26.790
COMPONENT OF RECOVERY. WHEN WE

00:55:26.856 --> 00:55:29.559
ARE FORCED INTO CARE, WE FEEL

00:55:29.626 --> 00:55:31.528
DEMEANED AND TRAUMATIZED, AND WE

00:55:31.594 --> 00:55:34.664
LOSE TRUST. THE GOOD NEWS IS

00:55:34.731 --> 00:55:36.533
THAT THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES THAT

00:55:36.599 --> 00:55:39.636
ARE PROVEN. WE DO HAVE THE DATA

00:55:39.703 --> 00:55:41.905
THAT THEY'RE EFFECTIVE PEER

00:55:41.971 --> 00:55:43.673
SUPPORT WITHIN A PEER RUN

00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:46.042
ORGANIZATION WORKS, AND THERE

00:55:46.109 --> 00:55:48.278
ARE MULTIPLE STUDIES TO PROVE

00:55:48.344 --> 00:55:52.949
IT. HAVING BIPOLAR ONE IS NO

00:55:53.016 --> 00:55:56.352
JOKE. TO FUNCTION AND HAVE A

00:55:56.419 --> 00:56:00.256
LIFE THAT'S FULFILLING, WE NEED

00:56:00.323 --> 00:56:02.125
TO ACCESS MULTIPLE THERAPIES AND

00:56:02.192 --> 00:56:03.460
SUPPORTS. I NEED TO ACCESS

00:56:03.526 --> 00:56:05.495
MULTIPLE THERAPIES AND SUPPORTS

00:56:05.562 --> 00:56:07.197
TO BE ABLE TO BE HERE IN FRONT

00:56:07.263 --> 00:56:09.165
OF YOU TODAY. BUT JUST BECAUSE

00:56:09.232 --> 00:56:11.034
I'M BIPOLAR SHOULD NOT MEAN THAT

00:56:11.101 --> 00:56:13.570
I HAVE LESS RIGHTS. I SUBMIT TO

00:56:13.636 --> 00:56:15.472
YOU THAT JUST LIKE ALL OF US, I

00:56:15.538 --> 00:56:17.006
SHOULD ALWAYS, ALWAYS HAVE THE

00:56:17.073 --> 00:56:20.043
RIGHT TO CHOOSE. THANK YOU,

00:56:20.110 --> 00:56:21.878
THANK YOU. WE WILL NOW MOVE

00:56:21.945 --> 00:56:23.113

MUCH FOR BRINGING THE BILL

00:58:19.262 --> 00:58:21.397
FORWARD. I REMEMBER THE STRUGGLE

00:58:21.464 --> 00:58:22.565
WHEN WE TRIED TO GET THIS

00:58:22.632 --> 00:58:24.033
THROUGH, AND WE DID GET THROUGH

00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:26.069
WITH A SENATOR EGGMAN AND

00:58:26.135 --> 00:58:26.703
YOURSELF, AND I ALWAYS THOUGHT

00:58:26.769 --> 00:58:28.972
OF IT AS A FOUNDATION, AND WE

00:58:29.038 --> 00:58:29.606
BUILD ON THAT FOUNDATION EACH

00:58:29.672 --> 00:58:31.574
TIME WE COME IN AND TRY TO WORK

00:58:31.641 --> 00:58:34.410
ON POLICY. SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING

00:58:34.477 --> 00:58:36.579

00:58:36.646 --> 00:58:39.716

00:58:44.921 --> 00:58:46.422
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL

00:58:46.489 --> 00:58:48.358
FORWARD AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF

00:58:48.424 --> 00:58:49.192
SAN DIEGO COUNTY, ONE OF THE

00:58:49.259 --> 00:58:51.661
PILOT AREAS THAT WAS LOOKING AT

00:58:51.728 --> 00:58:53.162
CARE COURTS, I HAVE TO SAY WE'VE

00:58:53.229 --> 00:58:56.266
COME A LONG WAY. AND WHILE WE DO

00:58:56.332 --> 00:58:58.534
SEE THAT THERE'S STILL CAPACITY

00:58:58.601 --> 00:59:00.370
IN THE SYSTEM, WE DIDN'T GET AS

00:59:00.436 --> 00:59:03.806
MANY PEOPLE PETITIONING FOR THE

00:59:03.873 --> 00:59:04.974
SERVICES THROUGH CARE COURTS AS

00:59:05.041 --> 00:59:07.810
WE COULD HAVE. I AM CONCERNED BY

00:59:07.877 --> 00:59:10.013
THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS THAT

00:59:10.079 --> 00:59:11.714
WE DON'T HAVE CAPACITY IN OUR

00:59:11.781 --> 00:59:14.984
SYSTEM TO DO THAT. SO CAN YOU

00:59:15.051 --> 00:59:16.853
EXPRESS IN A MORE FINITE WAY

00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:18.955
WHAT THAT CAPACITY ISSUE IS?

00:59:19.022 --> 00:59:21.457
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT NEAR CAPACITY

00:59:21.524 --> 00:59:24.527
WITH THE FIRST ROLLOUT. THANK

00:59:24.594 --> 00:59:26.262
YOU SO MUCH, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:59:26.329 --> 00:59:28.698
PATEL. YES, I CAN SPEAK TO THAT.

00:59:28.765 --> 00:59:32.201
SO ORIGINALLY AS CONCEIVED, CARE

00:59:32.268 --> 00:59:35.138
COURT WAS INTENDED TO REALLY

00:59:35.204 --> 00:59:37.440
FOCUS ON AN UNHOUSED POPULATION

00:59:37.507 --> 00:59:39.509
WITH SIGNIFICANT MENTAL HEALTH

00:59:39.575 --> 00:59:42.045
CONDITIONS WHO DID NOT QUALIFY

00:59:42.111 --> 00:59:44.180
FOR A HIGHER, MORE RESTRICTIVE

00:59:44.247 --> 00:59:46.015
LEVEL OF CONSERVATORSHIP, FOR

00:59:46.082 --> 00:59:49.585
EXAMPLE. HOWEVER, THE POLICY

00:59:49.652 --> 00:59:52.121
ITSELF DID NOT ALIGN BRING WITH

00:59:52.188 --> 00:59:54.791
IT HOUSING RESOURCES. THERE WAS

00:59:54.857 --> 00:59:56.759
A ONE TIME INVESTMENT IN

00:59:56.826 --> 00:59:58.227
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, BRIDGE

00:59:58.294 --> 01:00:00.730
HOUSING. COUNTIES HAVE SPENT

01:00:00.797 --> 01:00:02.432
DOWN THAT INVESTMENT, SO WE ARE

01:00:02.498 --> 01:00:04.767
CURRENTLY HOUSING INDIVIDUALS

01:00:04.834 --> 01:00:07.236
BOTH WITHIN CARE COURT AND MORE

01:00:07.303 --> 01:00:08.604
IMPORTANTLY, PERHAPS OUTSIDE OF

01:00:08.671 --> 01:00:10.473
CARE COURT WITH THAT BEHAVIORAL

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:11.808
HEALTH BRIDGE HOUSING

01:00:11.874 --> 01:00:15.011
INVESTMENT, WE DO NOT HAVE EXTRA

01:00:15.078 --> 01:00:20.149
HOUSING RESOURCES CURRENTLY TO

01:00:20.216 --> 01:00:21.884
WITHSTAND AN EIGHT FOLD INCREASE

01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:24.287
IN THE ELIGIBLE POPULATION.

01:00:24.354 --> 01:00:25.521
MEANING IF WE TRY TO BRING

01:00:25.588 --> 01:00:27.423
PEOPLE INTO CARE COURT ON THE

01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:28.658
PROMISE THAT THERE WILL BE

01:00:28.725 --> 01:00:30.560
HOUSING FOR THEM, IT'S WE DON'T

01:00:30.626 --> 01:00:32.395
HAVE ANYTHING NEW RIGHT NOW FOR

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:34.931
THEM. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE OF

01:00:34.998 --> 01:00:37.800
THE RAMP UP TIME, WE HAD

01:00:37.867 --> 01:00:39.535
ESSENTIALLY TWO WAVES OF

01:00:39.602 --> 01:00:40.703
IMPLEMENTATION. THERE WAS AN

01:00:40.770 --> 01:00:43.606
INITIAL PILOT PHASE, AND THEN IT

01:00:43.673 --> 01:00:45.141
EXPANDED TO ALL 58 COUNTIES THAT

01:00:45.208 --> 01:00:46.909
GAVE COUNTIES THE TIME TO

01:00:46.976 --> 01:00:50.279
DEVELOP BUDGETS, TO HIRE AND

01:00:50.346 --> 01:00:52.148
RECRUIT STAFF AND TRAIN THEM IN

01:00:52.215 --> 01:00:54.751
ORDER TO MEET THE NEEDS. AND ONE

01:00:54.817 --> 01:00:57.620
OF THE THINGS THAT I TRIED TO,

01:00:57.687 --> 01:00:58.955
YOU KNOW, SORT OF PAINT A

01:00:59.022 --> 01:01:00.456
PICTURE AROUND IS THAT WE ARE

01:01:00.523 --> 01:01:01.958
SEEING MORE PEOPLE AS A RESULT

01:01:02.025 --> 01:01:03.826
OF CARE COURT. THEY'RE JUST NOT

01:01:03.893 --> 01:01:05.495
ALL GETTING CARE PLANS. AND SO

01:01:05.561 --> 01:01:07.797
IT DOES BRING PEOPLE INTO COUNTY

01:01:07.864 --> 01:01:08.765
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. AND WE'RE

01:01:08.831 --> 01:01:10.333
REALLY THRILLED ABOUT THAT SIDE

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.035
EFFECT, I WOULD SAY OF CARE

01:01:12.101 --> 01:01:14.170
COURT ARE FOLKS HAVE FOUND VALUE

01:01:14.237 --> 01:01:17.106
IN HAVING THIS OTHER LEVEL OF

01:01:17.173 --> 01:01:19.242
CARE. THE URGENCY CLAUSE IN

01:01:19.308 --> 01:01:20.643
THIS, HOWEVER, IS SOMETHING THAT

01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:23.046
WE DON'T UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THE

01:01:23.112 --> 01:01:25.548
COURTS VIEW US AS THE ENTITY

01:01:25.615 --> 01:01:27.250
PRIMARILY TO BE HELD

01:01:27.316 --> 01:01:29.318
ACCOUNTABLE, AND WE IN NO WAY

01:01:29.385 --> 01:01:31.754
WOULD BE ABLE TO TURN ON A DIME,

01:01:31.821 --> 01:01:33.256
PIVOT SO QUICKLY, AND RESPOND TO

01:01:33.322 --> 01:01:35.691
THEIR VERY RIGHTFUL, YOU KNOW,

01:01:35.758 --> 01:01:36.859
EXPECTATION THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:01:36.926 --> 01:01:38.428
BE HANDLING THESE INDIVIDUALS

01:01:38.494 --> 01:01:39.796
WITH THE CARE AND CONSIDERATION

01:01:39.862 --> 01:01:41.564
THAT THEY DESERVE, BEING BROUGHT

01:01:41.631 --> 01:01:43.032
BEFORE THE COURT IN A CIVIL

01:01:43.099 --> 01:01:46.335
COURT PROCESS, AND TO OUR CITY

01:01:46.402 --> 01:01:48.304
AND TO OUR AUTHOR. DO YOU HAVE A

01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:50.540
RESPONSE TO THAT? SO THANK YOU,

01:01:50.606 --> 01:01:51.941
ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATEL, YOU'VE

01:01:52.008 --> 01:01:54.110
HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD. SAN

01:01:54.177 --> 01:01:55.845
DIEGO, AS WELL AS MOST COUNTIES

01:01:55.912 --> 01:01:57.480
IN THE STATE, ARE NOT

01:01:57.547 --> 01:01:59.549
EXPERIENCING THE KIND OF NUMBERS

01:01:59.615 --> 01:02:01.584
THAT THAT WERE ANTICIPATED.

01:02:01.651 --> 01:02:03.186
THAT'S OKAY THOUGH. I MEAN, THIS

01:02:03.252 --> 01:02:04.554
IS A PROJECT THAT THAT IS

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:05.988
GROWING AND IT IS INNOVATIVE AND

01:02:06.055 --> 01:02:08.491
IS DYNAMIC AND IT IS NEW. AND SO

01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:10.726
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A CLEANUP

01:02:10.793 --> 01:02:13.229
BILLS LAST YEAR. AND THIS YEAR,

01:02:13.296 --> 01:02:15.264
I ACTUALLY WOULD REFER TO MISS

01:02:15.331 --> 01:02:17.800
WELCH AND REED RASOOL IN TERMS

01:02:17.867 --> 01:02:20.369
OF CAPACITY. BUT BUT I, I TAKE

01:02:20.436 --> 01:02:22.872
YOUR POINT. WE'RE NOT AT NEAR

01:02:22.939 --> 01:02:25.174
CAPACITY. I DISAGREE IN TERMS OF

01:02:25.241 --> 01:02:27.376
THE NUMBERS BECAUSE THERE'S SORT

01:02:27.443 --> 01:02:29.545
OF A FILTERING PROCESS. SO FIRST

01:02:29.612 --> 01:02:31.013
TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR CARE COURT

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:33.082
RIGHT NOW YOU NEED TO HAVE

01:02:33.149 --> 01:02:33.716
SCHIZOPHRENIA OR SCHIZOPHRENIA

01:02:33.783 --> 01:02:36.552
LIKE SYMPTOMS. VERY SMALL

01:02:36.619 --> 01:02:38.488
POPULATION. WE'LL EXPAND IT

01:02:38.554 --> 01:02:42.024
FAIRLY FINITELY TO THOSE WITH

01:02:42.091 --> 01:02:45.228
BIPOLAR ONE WITH PSYCHOSIS. SO

01:02:45.294 --> 01:02:46.796
IN ADDITION TO THAT YOU ALSO

01:02:46.863 --> 01:02:49.365
NEED TO BE A DANGER TO YOURSELF

01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:51.901
OR TO OTHERS. SO I THINK THEY

01:02:51.968 --> 01:02:53.803
CAN PROBABLY RESPOND AS TO WHAT

01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:56.072
THAT MEANS IN TERMS OF

01:02:56.139 --> 01:02:58.674
POPULATION, I CAN ONLY REFER TO

01:02:58.741 --> 01:03:00.810
MY OWN COUNTY, ORANGE COUNTY,

01:03:00.877 --> 01:03:03.980
WHICH HAS BEEN DOING WELL, HAS

01:03:04.046 --> 01:03:07.950
THE CAPACITY AND IN FACT WE ARE

01:03:08.017 --> 01:03:08.885
SEEING INCREASE IN PETITION, BUT

01:03:08.951 --> 01:03:12.488
WE'RE NOT NEAR NEAR THE TOP YET.

01:03:12.555 --> 01:03:14.991
THANK YOU FOR THAT RESPONSE. DID

01:03:15.057 --> 01:03:18.327
YOU WANT TO RESPOND AS WELL? IS

01:03:18.394 --> 01:03:20.029
THIS ON? OH, HI. GOOD AFTERNOON.

01:03:20.096 --> 01:03:21.264
STEPHANIE WELCH, DEPUTY

01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:21.964
SECRETARY AT THE HEALTH AND

01:03:22.031 --> 01:03:23.900
HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. A COUPLE

01:03:23.966 --> 01:03:25.101
OF POINTS I'D LIKE TO MENTION.

01:03:25.168 --> 01:03:26.402
ONE, THE COUNTIES HAVE BEEN

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:28.538
DOING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

01:03:28.604 --> 01:03:29.172
WORK UTILIZING THEIR BEHAVIORAL

01:03:29.238 --> 01:03:30.406
HEALTH BRIDGE HOUSING DOLLARS TO

01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:32.575
HOUSE THIS POPULATION. A

01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:33.409
CONDITION OF THOSE FUNDS WAS

01:03:33.476 --> 01:03:35.711
THAT THEY HAD TO BE USED TO

01:03:35.778 --> 01:03:37.013
PRIORITIZE PEOPLE WHO QUALIFIED

01:03:37.079 --> 01:03:40.116
FOR CARE. AND SO WE ARE SEEING

01:03:40.183 --> 01:03:41.517
THAT AND ARE EXCITED FOR THEM TO

01:03:41.584 --> 01:03:43.386
CONTINUE TO BE DOING SO. WE ALSO

01:03:43.452 --> 01:03:45.021
ARE MAKING A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT

01:03:45.087 --> 01:03:46.822
IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. SO

01:03:46.889 --> 01:03:48.524
FISCAL YEAR STARTING JULY 1ST,

01:03:48.591 --> 01:03:50.092
2026, COUNTIES WILL BE ABLE TO

01:03:50.159 --> 01:03:52.828
USE SOME OF THEIR DHS DOLLARS TO

01:03:52.895 --> 01:03:55.231
PAY FOR HOUSING SUPPORTS. WE

01:03:55.298 --> 01:03:56.566
ENVISION INDIVIDUALS WHO MEET

01:03:56.632 --> 01:03:58.501
THE CRITERIA FOR CARE AS BEING

01:03:58.568 --> 01:04:00.403
REALLY APPROPRIATELY PLACED IN

01:04:00.469 --> 01:04:02.572
WHAT WE CALL OCC LEVEL OR

01:04:02.638 --> 01:04:04.373
ASSERTIVE COMMUNITY, ASSERTIVE

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:07.610
ASSISTED COMMUNITY TREATMENT

01:04:07.677 --> 01:04:09.045
MODELS. THAT'S THE KIND OF

01:04:09.111 --> 01:04:10.279
WRAPAROUND CARE WHICH INCLUDES

01:04:10.346 --> 01:04:12.949
HOUSING SUPPORTS. AND WE DO

01:04:13.015 --> 01:04:15.151
BELIEVE THAT THESE FIT WELL

01:04:15.218 --> 01:04:17.053
TOGETHER. PART OF THE VISION OF

01:04:17.119 --> 01:04:20.489
WANTING TO REFRESH AND MODERNIZE

01:04:20.556 --> 01:04:21.991
THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT

01:04:22.058 --> 01:04:22.992
INTO THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

01:04:23.059 --> 01:04:24.393
SERVICES ACT WAS TO MAKE SURE

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:26.028
THAT THERE WAS MORE CAPACITY TO

01:04:26.095 --> 01:04:28.030
SERVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE VERY

01:04:28.097 --> 01:04:31.634
CHRONIC, COMPLEX CONDITIONS.

01:04:31.701 --> 01:04:33.736
NOW, I DO WANT TO CLARIFY THAT

01:04:33.803 --> 01:04:36.439
IS BEGINNING NEXT FISCAL YEAR.

01:04:36.505 --> 01:04:39.642
SO JULY 1ST, 2026 WOULD BE HAPPY

01:04:39.709 --> 01:04:41.844
TO TALK MORE WITH THE COUNTIES

01:04:41.911 --> 01:04:42.478
ABOUT THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT NOT

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:43.779
HAVING ENOUGH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

01:04:43.846 --> 01:04:45.181
BRIDGE HOUSING DOLLARS FOR

01:04:45.248 --> 01:04:46.482
CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. IT'S NOT

01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:48.050
OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT ALL

01:04:48.117 --> 01:04:49.318
COUNTIES DO NOT HAVE ANY

01:04:49.385 --> 01:04:50.553
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BRIDGE HOUSING

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:51.821
MONEY LEFT. AND THE LAST THING

01:04:51.887 --> 01:04:54.590
THAT I WOULD SAY, AND IT IS AN

01:04:54.657 --> 01:04:57.360
IMPORTANT POINT, CARE WAS

01:04:57.426 --> 01:04:59.862
CONCEIVED ALSO, FRANKLY, TO

01:04:59.929 --> 01:05:01.564
PRIORITIZE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL

01:05:01.631 --> 01:05:02.698
HEALTH RESOURCES FOR THOSE

01:05:02.765 --> 01:05:03.833
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE THE MOST

01:05:03.899 --> 01:05:05.868
SEVERE, CHRONIC AND CHALLENGING

01:05:05.935 --> 01:05:07.136
CONDITIONS, THOSE WHO ARE AT THE

01:05:07.203 --> 01:05:09.071
RISK OF THE MOST NEGATIVE

01:05:09.138 --> 01:05:10.640
OUTCOMES THAT COME FROM NOT,

01:05:10.706 --> 01:05:13.409
FRANKLY, GETTING TO BE FIRST IN

01:05:13.476 --> 01:05:15.978
LINE BECAUSE THEY HAVE THOSE

01:05:16.045 --> 01:05:18.914
NEEDS. SO INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE

01:05:18.981 --> 01:05:20.683
REPEAT HOSPITALIZATIONS,

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:23.219
INDIVIDUALS WHO RELY UPON CRISIS

01:05:23.286 --> 01:05:24.587
SERVICES, INDIVIDUALS WHO MAYBE

01:05:24.654 --> 01:05:26.756
ONLY GET CARE IN THE EMERGENCY

01:05:26.822 --> 01:05:28.357
DEPARTMENT, THESE ARE

01:05:28.424 --> 01:05:30.459
INDIVIDUALS WHO ACTUALLY WERE

01:05:30.526 --> 01:05:31.460
ARE GETTING SERVICES. THEY'RE

01:05:31.527 --> 01:05:33.195
JUST NOT GETTING SERVICES THAT

01:05:33.262 --> 01:05:34.330
ARE COMMUNITY BASED AND WRAPPED

01:05:34.397 --> 01:05:36.565
AROUND. SO WE WOULD REALLY LOOK

01:05:36.632 --> 01:05:37.400
FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORKING

01:05:37.466 --> 01:05:39.035
WITH THE COUNTIES TO MAKE SURE

01:05:39.101 --> 01:05:40.836
THAT THEY HAVE THAT CAPACITY,

01:05:40.903 --> 01:05:42.772
FEEL SUPPORTED BY THE STATE,

01:05:42.838 --> 01:05:44.140
BECAUSE WE DO WANT THEM TO BE

01:05:44.206 --> 01:05:45.241
SUCCESSFUL. SERVING THIS

01:05:45.308 --> 01:05:46.575
POPULATION IS INCREDIBLY

01:05:46.642 --> 01:05:48.844
CHALLENGING, AND WE'VE SEEN

01:05:48.911 --> 01:05:51.213
TREMENDOUS SUCCESS STORIES. I

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:53.115
HOPE I HOPE THE SAME FOR THE FOR

01:05:53.182 --> 01:05:54.150
THE YOUNG LADY SITTING NEXT TO

01:05:54.216 --> 01:05:57.420
ME AND HER DAUGHTER. SO THANK

01:05:57.486 --> 01:06:00.990
YOU. SO ONE FINAL QUESTION SLASH

01:06:01.057 --> 01:06:02.825
COMMENT IS I UNDERSTAND DEEPLY

01:06:02.892 --> 01:06:06.362
THE NEED TO ADDRESS THIS GROWING

01:06:06.429 --> 01:06:07.930
CHALLENGE WE HAVE IN OUR

01:06:07.997 --> 01:06:09.598
COMMUNITIES AND SEEING THE

01:06:09.665 --> 01:06:11.100
IMPACT THAT WE CAN HAVE,

01:06:11.167 --> 01:06:12.635
UNDERSTANDING AND KNOWING THAT

01:06:12.702 --> 01:06:13.869
THIS IS NEVER GOING TO BE

01:06:13.936 --> 01:06:15.104
ENOUGH. AND WE'RE CONSTANTLY

01:06:15.171 --> 01:06:16.205
WORKING TOWARDS BUILDING

01:06:16.272 --> 01:06:18.074
CAPACITY AND SERVICES. THE NEED

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:20.743
IS JUST SO PRESSING THAT TODAY I

01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:22.044
WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL,

01:06:22.111 --> 01:06:23.245
AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'VE

01:06:23.312 --> 01:06:25.848
BEEN WORKING TO PUT IN SOME

01:06:25.915 --> 01:06:26.916
AMENDMENTS THAT RAISED AN

01:06:26.982 --> 01:06:30.019
EYEBROW FOR ME. IT'S AT A MUCH

01:06:30.086 --> 01:06:32.621
BETTER PLACE FOR ME, AND I'M

01:06:32.688 --> 01:06:36.392
HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT TODAY. THANK

01:06:36.459 --> 01:06:38.060
YOU, SENATOR, FOR BRINGING

01:06:38.127 --> 01:06:40.663
FORWARD THIS L I

01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:42.064
HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS AND

01:06:42.131 --> 01:06:43.966
OUR TEAMS HAVE AS WELL. I DID

01:06:44.033 --> 01:06:46.402
WANT TO JUST GET TO THE QUESTION

01:06:46.469 --> 01:06:47.937
THAT WAS RAISED BY DIRECTOR

01:06:48.003 --> 01:06:51.707
CABRERA AROUND PERHAPS THE

01:06:51.774 --> 01:06:53.976
TIMING ISSUE AROUND THE

01:06:54.043 --> 01:06:57.880
AVAILABILITY OF HOUSING AND THE

01:06:57.947 --> 01:06:59.682
URGENCY CLAUSE THAT'S IN THIS

01:06:59.749 --> 01:07:02.451
BILL, AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL

01:07:02.518 --> 01:07:04.687
EXPONENTIAL, ALTHOUGH WE DON'T

01:07:04.754 --> 01:07:07.490
ACTUALLY HAVE A NUMBER INCREASE

01:07:07.556 --> 01:07:09.492
WITH THE ADDITION OF THE BIPOLAR

01:07:09.558 --> 01:07:12.194
ONE WITH PSYCHOSIS IN THIS. AND

01:07:12.261 --> 01:07:14.697
SO I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A

01:07:14.764 --> 01:07:15.431
QUESTION FOR DEPUTY SECRETARY

01:07:15.498 --> 01:07:18.033
WELCH OR ISSUES THAT YOU'VE

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:21.270
THOUGHT ABOUT. SO HAVING FUNDING

01:07:21.337 --> 01:07:23.005
FOR HOUSING IS A VERY DIFFERENT

01:07:23.072 --> 01:07:24.874
PROPOSITION THAN ACTUALLY HAVING

01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:28.110
HOUSING AS WE KNOW. HAVE YOU ALL

01:07:28.177 --> 01:07:30.579
BEEN ABLE TO MAP OUT, IF YOU

01:07:30.646 --> 01:07:32.047
WILL, THE AVAILABILITY OF THAT

01:07:32.114 --> 01:07:34.984
HOUSING BY COUNTY AND THE

01:07:35.050 --> 01:07:38.254
POTENTIAL INCREASE OF PEOPLE WHO

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:40.423
ARE PARTICIPATING IN CARE COURT

01:07:40.489 --> 01:07:41.424
WHO WOULD NEED TO AVAIL

01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:44.293
THEMSELVES OF THAT HOUSING? WE

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:46.529
HAVE NOT DONE THAT SPECIFIC

01:07:46.595 --> 01:07:48.631
ANALYSIS. WHAT I WOULD SAY IS

01:07:48.697 --> 01:07:50.733
THAT BRINGING PEOPLE INTO

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.234
HOUSING IS ALSO A PROCESS, AS

01:07:52.301 --> 01:07:55.471
YOU KNOW, AND NOT EVERYBODY. YOU

01:07:55.538 --> 01:07:58.340
DO NOT HAVE TO BE UNHOUSED TO

01:07:58.407 --> 01:08:00.309
QUALIFY FOR CARE COURT. SO WE'VE

01:08:00.376 --> 01:08:02.344
ONLY BEEN ABLE TO HAVE SOME

01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:03.813
REALLY, IN TERMS OF VALIDATED

01:08:03.879 --> 01:08:06.215
DATA, NOT I THINK IT'S ROUGHLY

01:08:06.282 --> 01:08:08.050
AROUND HALF OF OUR INDIVIDUALS

01:08:08.117 --> 01:08:09.919
ARE UNHOUSED. SO I JUST WANT TO

01:08:09.985 --> 01:08:12.054
BE CLEAR THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU

01:08:12.121 --> 01:08:13.189
QUALIFY FOR CARE COURT, MAYBE

01:08:13.255 --> 01:08:16.058
EVEN UNDER THE ADDITION OF

01:08:16.125 --> 01:08:17.827
BIPOLAR ONE, WITH PSYCHOTIC WITH

01:08:17.893 --> 01:08:19.862
PSYCHOTIC FEATURES, THAT DOESN'T

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:20.996
NECESSARILY MEAN THAT YOU'RE

01:08:21.063 --> 01:08:22.665
UNHOUSED AND THAT YOU REQUIRE

01:08:22.731 --> 01:08:25.401
HOUSING. AND I THINK I WOULD

01:08:25.468 --> 01:08:27.336
LEAVE IT TO THE DOCTOR TO ASSIST

01:08:27.403 --> 01:08:29.305
WITH THE NUMBERS ON HOW WE'RE

01:08:29.371 --> 01:08:30.706
PREDICTING. HOW MANY PEOPLE

01:08:30.773 --> 01:08:33.309
MIGHT THIS BE. BUT AGAIN, THIS

01:08:33.375 --> 01:08:35.144
IS NOT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST

01:08:35.211 --> 01:08:36.779
JUST DIAGNOSED WITH BIPOLAR ONE

01:08:36.846 --> 01:08:38.247
WITH PSYCHOTIC FEATURES. IT'S

01:08:38.314 --> 01:08:39.782
FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUCH

01:08:39.849 --> 01:08:41.951
IMPAIRED FUNCTIONALITY THAT THEY

01:08:42.017 --> 01:08:44.453
WOULD NOT BE SAFE IN THE

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:48.357
COMMUNITY WITHOUT TREATMENT. SO

01:08:48.424 --> 01:08:51.961
I APPRECIATE RECENT REPORT IN

01:08:52.027 --> 01:08:54.697
JULY THAT OUTLINED STATISTICS

01:08:54.763 --> 01:08:56.432
THAT UP UNTIL THIS POINT HADN'T

01:08:56.499 --> 01:08:58.734
BEEN REPORTED. AND ONE OF THE

01:08:58.801 --> 01:08:59.735
ONES THAT I WAS PARTICULARLY

01:08:59.802 --> 01:09:01.303
IMPRESSED WITH AND I THINK

01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:02.471
REFLECTS THE GREAT WORK THE

01:09:02.538 --> 01:09:04.974
COUNTIES HAVE DONE, IS OF THE

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:05.508
CARE PARTICIPANTS WHO ARE

01:09:05.574 --> 01:09:06.842
UNHOUSED AT THE TIME OF THEIR

01:09:06.909 --> 01:09:09.345
PETITIONING. SO 33%, 66% OF

01:09:09.411 --> 01:09:11.013
THOSE HAD OBTAINED SOME FORM OF

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:12.781
HOUSING. SO I THINK THAT IS

01:09:12.848 --> 01:09:15.050
ENCOURAGING. AS FAR AS THE

01:09:15.117 --> 01:09:17.119
NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD

01:09:17.186 --> 01:09:20.756
QUALIFY UNDER THIS NEW

01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:21.857
DIAGNOSIS. SO THE LIFETIME

01:09:21.924 --> 01:09:23.692
PREVALENCE OF BIPOLAR ONE

01:09:23.759 --> 01:09:27.062
DISORDER IS ABOUT 1%. WHEN WE

01:09:27.129 --> 01:09:28.998
HAVE STATISTICS ABOUT, YOU KNOW,

01:09:29.064 --> 01:09:31.567
UPWARDS OF 4.4%, THAT'S

01:09:31.634 --> 01:09:33.402
INCLUDING BIPOLAR ONE, BIPOLAR

01:09:33.469 --> 01:09:35.571
TWO, SUBTHRESHOLD BIPOLAR

01:09:35.638 --> 01:09:37.339
DISORDER. BUT BIPOLAR ONE

01:09:37.406 --> 01:09:39.775
DISORDER IS ABOUT 1 TO 1.06%.

01:09:39.842 --> 01:09:41.610
LIFETIME PREVALENCE. WHEN YOU'RE

01:09:41.677 --> 01:09:43.379
LOOKING AT BIPOLAR DISORDER WITH

01:09:43.445 --> 01:09:45.247
PSYCHOTIC FEATURES, THAT IS

01:09:45.314 --> 01:09:46.749
OBVIOUSLY A FRACTION OF THAT. SO

01:09:46.815 --> 01:09:52.121
ABOUT 0.24 TO 0.74% OF PEOPLE

01:09:52.187 --> 01:09:55.357
WITH BIPOLAR ONE DISORDER HAVE

01:09:55.424 --> 01:09:56.825
ALSO A DIAGNOSIS OF WITH

01:09:56.892 --> 01:09:58.627
PSYCHOTIC FEATURES. SO WITH

01:09:58.694 --> 01:10:00.663
PSYCHOTIC FEATURES IS TWO OUT OF

01:10:00.729 --> 01:10:03.933
ABOUT TEN SPECIFIERS OF BIPOLAR

01:10:03.999 --> 01:10:05.100
ONE DISORDER. SO WHEN WE'RE

01:10:05.167 --> 01:10:08.070
TALKING ABOUT BIPOLAR ONE

01:10:08.137 --> 01:10:09.305
DISORDER. IT REALLY IS A

01:10:09.371 --> 01:10:11.240
FRACTION WHEN YOU'RE CONSIDERING

01:10:11.307 --> 01:10:12.708
BIPOLAR ONE WITH PSYCHOTIC

01:10:12.775 --> 01:10:14.743
FEATURES. AND THEN YOU FACTOR IN

01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:17.546
ALL THE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

01:10:17.613 --> 01:10:18.981
THAT ARE NECESSARY TO MEET FOR

01:10:19.048 --> 01:10:21.984
CARE ACT ELIGIBILITY. SO I

01:10:22.051 --> 01:10:23.152
ANTICIPATE THAT IT WOULD BE A

01:10:23.218 --> 01:10:24.620
SMALL NUMBER. AND WE HAVE

01:10:24.687 --> 01:10:25.921
ADDITIONAL DATA FROM ANOTHER

01:10:25.988 --> 01:10:28.357
COURT SUPERVISED AOT PROGRAM

01:10:28.424 --> 01:10:30.259
THAT ALSO SHOWS THAT MOOD

01:10:30.326 --> 01:10:32.461
DISORDERS ARE A FRACTION OF

01:10:32.528 --> 01:10:33.228
PARTICIPATION WHEN YOU'RE

01:10:33.295 --> 01:10:35.164
COMPARING TO OTHER COUNTIES. AND

01:10:35.230 --> 01:10:36.665
THIS IS CONSISTENT IN LOS

01:10:36.732 --> 01:10:40.002
ANGELES COUNTY, NEVADA COUNTY.

01:10:40.069 --> 01:10:41.437
THERE'S ALSO DATA FROM CONTRA

01:10:41.503 --> 01:10:43.639
COSTA COUNTY, ORANGE COUNTY THAT

01:10:43.706 --> 01:10:45.240
THAT ALL SAY THAT MOOD DISORDERS

01:10:45.307 --> 01:10:47.109
OR BIPOLAR DISORDERS ARE A

01:10:47.176 --> 01:10:49.278
FRACTION OF AOT PARTICIPANTS.

01:10:49.345 --> 01:10:51.547
AND THE ELIGIBILITY FOR AOT IS

01:10:51.614 --> 01:10:54.316
SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS. SO I DO

01:10:54.383 --> 01:10:55.818
NOT THINK PEOPLE WITH BIPOLAR

01:10:55.884 --> 01:10:57.720
DISORDER, ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WITH

01:10:57.786 --> 01:10:59.121
BIPOLAR ONE WITH PSYCHOTIC

01:10:59.188 --> 01:11:01.123
FEATURES, IS AN EXPONENTIAL

01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:02.825
INCREASE. YEAH. I JUST WANT TO

01:11:02.891 --> 01:11:04.259
BE VERY CLEAR. WE WORKED VERY

01:11:04.326 --> 01:11:09.198
HARD TO UNDERSTAND THE INITIAL

01:11:09.264 --> 01:11:13.602
INTENT OF THE CARE ACT AND, AND

01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:16.305
HAD STRUGGLED KIND OF THROUGH

01:11:16.372 --> 01:11:17.906
COMMITTEE WITH THE EXPANSION OF

01:11:17.973 --> 01:11:20.009
THIS TO MORE BROADLY MOOD

01:11:20.075 --> 01:11:21.810
DISORDERS, GIVEN THE EXPONENTIAL

01:11:21.877 --> 01:11:23.178
INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

01:11:23.245 --> 01:11:30.452
AND ALSO THAT IT IS. REALLY

01:11:30.519 --> 01:11:31.954
BROADENS THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF,

01:11:32.021 --> 01:11:33.856
OF THE CARE ACT TO INCLUDE

01:11:33.922 --> 01:11:35.524
PEOPLE WITH MOOD DISORDERS. SO I

01:11:35.591 --> 01:11:38.293
JUST WANT TO ENSURE THAT OUR

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:38.961
COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE FOCUSED ON

01:11:39.028 --> 01:11:41.497
THAT AS WELL. DIRECTOR CABRERA,

01:11:41.563 --> 01:11:43.065
WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND TO ANY

01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:44.967
OF THE ISSUES AROUND THE

01:11:45.034 --> 01:11:46.535
HOUSING? THANK YOU. YES,

01:11:46.602 --> 01:11:48.270
ABSOLUTELY. BRIEFLY. YOU KNOW,

01:11:48.337 --> 01:11:51.306
WE DID IN THIS BUDGET THAT WAS

01:11:51.373 --> 01:11:53.409
JUST PASSED, CUT THE FINAL ROUND

01:11:53.475 --> 01:11:55.177
OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BRIDGE

01:11:55.244 --> 01:11:58.414
HOUSING. IN ADDITION, I WILL

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.916
NOTE AGAIN, THE MONIES UNDER

01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:02.351
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BRIDGE HOUSING

01:12:02.418 --> 01:12:06.221
ARE ALREADY SPENT. ESSENTIALLY,

01:12:06.288 --> 01:12:07.990
WE'RE GOING TO ROLL THOSE OVER

01:12:08.057 --> 01:12:10.359
INTO MEANING. THE PEOPLE WHO WE

01:12:10.426 --> 01:12:11.527
HOUSE ARE PEOPLE WITH

01:12:11.593 --> 01:12:12.895
SIGNIFICANT DISABILITIES. THEY

01:12:12.961 --> 01:12:15.431
DON'T OFTEN JUST GET A JOB AND

01:12:15.497 --> 01:12:17.466
GO OUT AND AFFORD RENT. IN

01:12:17.533 --> 01:12:20.469
CALIFORNIA, THEY OFTEN STAY

01:12:20.536 --> 01:12:23.772
REQUIRING SUBSIDIES. AND SO THE

01:12:23.839 --> 01:12:25.741
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BRIDGE HOUSING

01:12:25.808 --> 01:12:27.643
ROLLS OVER INTO IF WE WERE TO

01:12:27.710 --> 01:12:29.111
EXPAND THE POPULATION NEEDING

01:12:29.178 --> 01:12:30.412
HOUSING, WE WOULD NEED TO BRING

01:12:30.479 --> 01:12:33.849
IN ADDITIONAL HOUSING RESOURCES.

01:12:33.916 --> 01:12:36.018
BUT THE MORE IMPORTANT PIECE IS

01:12:36.085 --> 01:12:38.087
WE HAVE COURT ORDERED TIMELINES.

01:12:38.153 --> 01:12:39.488
WE HAVE TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE

01:12:39.555 --> 01:12:41.156
COURT WITHIN CERTAIN TIMELINES

01:12:41.223 --> 01:12:44.259
UNDER CARE COURT, AND THAT MEANS

01:12:44.326 --> 01:12:46.328
LOCATING AN INDIVIDUAL, TRYING

01:12:46.395 --> 01:12:48.063
TO ENGAGE THEM INTO SERVICES AND

01:12:48.130 --> 01:12:50.132
PUT TOGETHER A REPORT FOR THE

01:12:50.199 --> 01:12:51.767
COURT. THOSE SORTS OF

01:12:51.834 --> 01:12:53.802
ACTIVITIES, REALLY, IT DOESN'T

01:12:53.869 --> 01:12:54.937
MATTER IF THEY END UP WITH A

01:12:55.003 --> 01:12:56.772
CARE PLAN OR NOT. WE STILL ARE

01:12:56.839 --> 01:12:58.307
HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THAT. AND

01:12:58.373 --> 01:13:02.077
SO INCREASING THE VOLUME OVERALL

01:13:02.144 --> 01:13:04.379
DOES HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR

01:13:04.446 --> 01:13:06.348
STAFFING RESOURCES. EVERY

01:13:06.415 --> 01:13:08.183
PETITION THAT WE HAVE TO TRACK

01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:10.285
DOWN IS ANOTHER PERSON IN NEED

01:13:10.352 --> 01:13:13.288
WHO WE'RE NOT SERVING. AND SO

01:13:13.355 --> 01:13:15.758
IT'S IT REALLY IS A ZERO SUM.

01:13:15.824 --> 01:13:16.625
UNFORTUNATELY, AT THE END OF THE

01:13:16.692 --> 01:13:18.927
DAY. AND I JUST WANT TO NOTE

01:13:18.994 --> 01:13:21.263
THAT, YOU KNOW, OUR NIMH

01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:23.866
ESTIMATES SHOW 2.8% HAVING

01:13:23.932 --> 01:13:25.868
BIPOLAR. ONE HALF OF THAT

01:13:25.934 --> 01:13:27.269
POPULATION HAS PSYCHOTIC

01:13:27.336 --> 01:13:29.571
FEATURES. SO WE'RE RELYING ON

01:13:29.638 --> 01:13:33.208
NIMH DATA FOR THOSE FIGURES.

01:13:33.275 --> 01:13:37.412
THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK YOU,

01:13:37.479 --> 01:13:38.514
SENATOR UMBERG, FOR BRINGING

01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:41.483
FORWARD THIS BILL, AND CERTAINLY

01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:43.619
FOR YOUR STEWARDSHIP OF THIS OF

01:13:43.685 --> 01:13:46.522
THE CARE ACT AND THE SUBSEQUENT

01:13:46.588 --> 01:13:47.890
PIECES OF LEGISLATION. I KNOW IT

01:13:47.956 --> 01:13:49.525
IS A PASSION POINT OF YOURS, AND

01:13:49.591 --> 01:13:50.893
SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE BEEN

01:13:50.959 --> 01:13:52.561
VERY COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT

01:13:52.628 --> 01:13:54.396
WE'RE LEADING ON. I VERY MUCH

01:13:54.463 --> 01:13:55.364
APPRECIATED THE CONVERSATIONS

01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:57.266
THAT WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE, AND

01:13:57.332 --> 01:13:59.468
THAT OUR STAFF WAS ABLE TO HAVE

01:13:59.535 --> 01:14:01.703
ON ON THIS. I THINK YOU HEARD

01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:03.505
SOME OF THE INITIAL CONCERNS

01:14:03.572 --> 01:14:06.308
ABOUT THE BROADENING TO MOOD

01:14:06.375 --> 01:14:08.443
DISORDERS HAS BEEN ADDRESSED, IN

01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:09.745
PART WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT

01:14:09.812 --> 01:14:12.147
YOU WERE ABLE TO TAKE. AND I

01:14:12.214 --> 01:14:14.516
THINK THIS CONVERSATION AROUND

01:14:14.583 --> 01:14:15.951
THE TIMING ISSUES, WHETHER OR

01:14:16.018 --> 01:14:18.720
NOT THERE'S ACTUAL HOUSING

01:14:18.787 --> 01:14:20.589
AVAILABLE, THE SWITCH OF

01:14:20.656 --> 01:14:22.791
CAPACITY AND CONSTRAINTS ON

01:14:22.858 --> 01:14:24.526
CAPACITY, THAT THIS WILL

01:14:24.593 --> 01:14:28.463
CERTAINLY CAUSE FOR OUR COUNTY

01:14:28.530 --> 01:14:29.598
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM, I

01:14:29.665 --> 01:14:31.433
THINK, IS SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:35.771
ALL TOO AWARE OF AS WELL. I, I

01:14:35.838 --> 01:14:37.940
JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT THIS IS

01:14:38.006 --> 01:14:39.408
A REALLY GOOD CONVERSATION.

01:14:39.474 --> 01:14:40.976
PERHAPS YOU AND I CAN DO AN

01:14:41.043 --> 01:14:42.678
OVERSIGHT HEARING ON THIS IN IN

01:14:42.744 --> 01:14:45.214
THE FALL. AT SOME POINT, I

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:46.215
WANTED TO JUST ARTICULATE WHAT

01:14:46.281 --> 01:14:47.950
THE AMENDMENTS WERE SO THAT WE

01:14:48.016 --> 01:14:50.485
ARE CLEAR ON THEM. IT LIMITS THE

01:14:50.552 --> 01:14:51.520
EXPANDED DIAGNOSES UNDER THE

01:14:51.587 --> 01:14:53.155
CARE ACT TO JUST BIPOLAR ONE

01:14:53.222 --> 01:14:54.890
DISORDER WITH PSYCHOTIC

01:14:54.957 --> 01:14:56.225
FEATURES. IT STRIKES PARAGRAPH

01:14:56.291 --> 01:14:57.659
TWO AND FOUR FROM THE CLINICALLY

01:14:57.726 --> 01:14:58.727
STABILIZED DEFINITION AND

01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:09.238

PROFESSIONALS, AND INSTEAD

01:15:12.274 --> 01:15:13.008
SPECIFICALLY INCLUDES THEM IN A

01:15:13.075 --> 01:15:14.910
MORE LIMITED ROLE, ALLOWING

01:15:20.082 --> 01:15:22.451
PETITION WITH THESE AMENDMENTS.

01:15:22.517 --> 01:15:24.286
AND I THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING

01:15:24.353 --> 01:15:26.088

01:15:26.154 --> 01:15:28.023
BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND KNOW

01:15:28.090 --> 01:15:30.125
THAT WE HAVE MANY MORE

01:15:30.192 --> 01:15:31.460
CONVERSATIONS TO HAVE IN THIS

01:15:31.526 --> 01:15:35.030
AREA, AND VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD

01:15:35.097 --> 01:15:36.865
TO A FINAL REPORT FROM THE

01:15:36.932 --> 01:15:40.202
AGENCY. WE'VE BEEN RELYING ON,

01:15:40.269 --> 01:15:42.437
ON LIMITED PROGRESS REPORTS THAT

01:15:42.504 --> 01:15:44.840
KIND OF USE THE SAME TIME STAMP

01:15:44.907 --> 01:15:47.075
TO BE ABLE TO EVALUATE THE

01:15:47.142 --> 01:15:48.277
EFFECTIVENESS AND SOME OF THE

01:15:48.343 --> 01:15:49.945
CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES

01:15:50.012 --> 01:15:52.481
WITH THE CARE ACT PROGRAM AS IT

01:15:52.547 --> 01:15:54.249
STANDS NOW, TO BE ABLE TO

01:15:54.316 --> 01:15:56.485
CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

01:15:56.551 --> 01:15:58.253
REFINING OUR POLICY IN A WAY

01:15:58.320 --> 01:15:59.121
THAT'S ALIGNED WITH THE PRACTICE

01:15:59.187 --> 01:16:00.722
THAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING RIGHT

01:16:00.789 --> 01:16:03.425
NOW. AND WITH THAT, SENATOR,

01:16:03.492 --> 01:16:05.093
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE? THANK

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:06.361
YOU, MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU FOR

01:16:06.428 --> 01:16:08.230
YOUR WORK ON THIS PARTICULAR

01:16:08.297 --> 01:16:10.565
ISSUE AS WELL. WE FOCUSED HERE

01:16:10.632 --> 01:16:11.800
IN THIS COMMITTEE ON THE HEALTH

01:16:11.867 --> 01:16:13.368
ASPECTS. THERE ARE OTHER ASPECTS

01:16:13.435 --> 01:16:14.803
OF THIS BILL, TOO, THAT ARE

01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:16.471
VERY, VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE

01:16:16.538 --> 01:16:17.105
CONTINUATION OF THE IMPROVEMENT

01:16:17.172 --> 01:16:19.374
OF CARE ACT. SO LET ME JUST GIVE

01:16:19.441 --> 01:16:20.909
YOU ONE OTHER EXAMPLE THAT

01:16:20.976 --> 01:16:21.543
ACTUALLY WAS HEARD IN JUDICIARY

01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:22.878
COMMITTEE. THAT'S WHERE SOMEONE

01:16:22.945 --> 01:16:24.112
IS CHARGED WITH A MISDEMEANOR

01:16:24.179 --> 01:16:25.948
WHO IS INCOMPETENT TO STAND

01:16:26.014 --> 01:16:27.916
TRIAL. AND WHAT WE CURRENTLY DO

01:16:27.983 --> 01:16:29.117
IS WE JUST RELEASE THEM. SO IF

01:16:29.184 --> 01:16:30.252
YOU'VE BEEN SHOPLIFTING, YOU'RE

01:16:30.319 --> 01:16:31.753
CLEARLY EXPERIENCING SOME KIND

01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:34.256
OF PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER. SO WE

01:16:34.323 --> 01:16:36.058
BRING YOU IN, YOU'RE INCOMPETENT

01:16:36.124 --> 01:16:37.459
TO STAND TRIAL, AND WE PUT YOU

01:16:37.526 --> 01:16:39.594
BACK OUT UNDER A BRIDGE THAT

01:16:39.661 --> 01:16:41.129
DOESN'T HELP ANYONE, CERTAINLY

01:16:41.196 --> 01:16:42.497
DOESN'T HELP PUBLIC SAFETY, NOR

01:16:42.564 --> 01:16:43.832
THE INDIVIDUAL NOR THE FAMILY.

01:16:43.899 --> 01:16:46.568
BUT WHAT THIS DOES IS IT SAYS

01:16:46.635 --> 01:16:47.336
THAT PERSON THEN CAN BE ENROLLED

01:16:47.402 --> 01:16:49.004
IN CARE COURT SO THAT THEY CAN

01:16:49.071 --> 01:16:50.005
POTENTIALLY RECEIVE TREATMENT. I

01:16:50.072 --> 01:16:51.974
DO AGREE WITH DOCTOR MEYER IN

01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:53.742
TERMS OF THE INCREASE. I THINK

01:16:53.809 --> 01:16:55.043
THE INCREASE IN POPULATION IS

01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:57.980
VERY SMALL. BUT TO BE CLEAR, THE

01:16:58.046 --> 01:16:59.414
INTENT ORIGINALLY OF THIS IS

01:16:59.481 --> 01:17:01.316
WHERE YOU SEE SOMEONE AND WE'VE

01:17:01.383 --> 01:17:03.285
ALL SEEN FOLKS AND SOME OF US,

01:17:03.352 --> 01:17:04.853
INCLUDING ME, HAVE HAD FAMILY

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:06.588
LIVED EXPERIENCE IN THIS SPACE

01:17:06.655 --> 01:17:08.623
WHO'S EXPERIENCING SCHIZOPHRENIA

01:17:08.690 --> 01:17:10.726
OR PSYCHOSIS, WHO'S OUT IN THE

01:17:10.792 --> 01:17:11.960
STREET YELLING AT A STOPLIGHT.

01:17:12.027 --> 01:17:13.295
BUT WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST

01:17:13.362 --> 01:17:16.031
IS WE BRING THEM IN, MAYBE PUT

01:17:16.098 --> 01:17:17.666
THEM ON A 72 HOUR HOLD AND WE

01:17:17.733 --> 01:17:18.900
PUT THEM BACK INTO THE

01:17:18.967 --> 01:17:20.135
COMMUNITY. BUT CARE COURT DOES,

01:17:20.202 --> 01:17:22.070
AND CLEARLY WE ARE RESOURCE

01:17:22.137 --> 01:17:22.871
CONSTRAINED. I WISH WE WEREN'T

01:17:22.938 --> 01:17:23.672
RESOURCE CONSTRAINED, BUT WHAT

01:17:23.739 --> 01:17:26.408
CARE COURT DOES IS FOR THOSE

01:17:26.475 --> 01:17:29.644
INDIVIDUALS IS WE DO PROVIDE A

01:17:29.711 --> 01:17:32.147
TREATMENT PLAN THAT HAS

01:17:32.214 --> 01:17:34.249
ACCOUNTABILITY BY A JUDGE THAT

01:17:34.316 --> 01:17:36.918
HAS THE ABILITY TO, FOR EXAMPLE,

01:17:36.985 --> 01:17:38.420
YES, ORDER THE COUNTY OR ORDER

01:17:38.487 --> 01:17:42.190
OR ORDER SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR THAT

01:17:42.257 --> 01:17:45.327
INDIVIDUAL. AND SO I'M GRATEFUL

01:17:45.394 --> 01:17:46.895
FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND I URGE AND

01:17:46.962 --> 01:17:49.498
I VOTE THANK YOU. WE HAVE A

01:19:54.856 --> 01:19:56.091
THANK YOU, SENATOR, WHENEVER

01:19:56.158 --> 01:19:57.893
YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU CHAIR.

01:19:57.959 --> 01:19:59.594
GOOD AFTERNOON, CHAIR AND

01:19:59.661 --> 01:20:01.363
COMMITTEE MEMBERS. TODAY I WILL

01:20:01.429 --> 01:20:03.665
BE PRESENTING SB 503, WHICH

01:20:03.732 --> 01:20:06.101
WOULD REQUIRE SPECIFIED

01:20:06.168 --> 01:20:08.003
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE OR AI

01:20:08.069 --> 01:20:09.905
TECHNOLOGY TO BE IDENTIFIED,

01:20:09.971 --> 01:20:12.107
MITIGATED, MONITORED FOR BIAS

01:20:12.174 --> 01:20:12.974
IMPACTS WHEN DEPLOYED IN THE

01:20:13.041 --> 01:20:14.843
HEALTH CARE FACILITIES. AND THIS

01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:16.578
BILL IS ALSO A PRIORITY OF THE

01:20:16.645 --> 01:20:18.213
CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:19.948
CAUCUS. I THANK THE COMMITTEE

01:20:20.015 --> 01:20:22.083
FOR THEIR ACTIVE AND METICULOUS

01:20:22.150 --> 01:20:23.552
ENGAGEMENT, AND WILL BE

01:20:23.618 --> 01:20:24.886
ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE'S

01:20:24.953 --> 01:20:27.455
AMENDMENTS TODAY. AI TOOLS DO

01:20:27.522 --> 01:20:29.257
NOT OPERATE IN A VACUUM. THEY

01:20:29.324 --> 01:20:31.059
ARE CREATED, TRAINED AND

01:20:31.126 --> 01:20:33.261
DEPLOYED BY PEOPLE, AND EACH

01:20:33.328 --> 01:20:34.996
STEP IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND

01:20:35.063 --> 01:20:36.831
DEPLOYMENT CAN BE EMBEDDED WITH

01:20:36.898 --> 01:20:39.801
AND REFLECT EXISTING SOCIETAL

01:20:39.868 --> 01:20:41.803
BIASES IN HEALTH CARE.

01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:43.738
SPECIFICALLY, DECISION SUPPORT

01:20:43.805 --> 01:20:45.473
TOOLS CAN BE DEVELOPED TO ASSIST

01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:47.576
WITH DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT PLAN,

01:20:47.642 --> 01:20:49.878
AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION.

01:20:49.945 --> 01:20:51.646
HOWEVER, IF THESE TOOLS ARE

01:20:51.713 --> 01:20:54.049
TRAINED ON INCOMPLETE

01:20:54.115 --> 01:20:55.650
NON-REPRESENTATIVE OR BIASED

01:20:55.717 --> 01:20:57.686
DATA, THEY RISK REINFORCING OR

01:20:57.752 --> 01:21:00.655
EVEN WORSE, WORSENING EXISTING

01:21:00.722 --> 01:21:02.791
DISPARITIES. WITHOUT BOTH

01:21:02.857 --> 01:21:05.093
PROACTIVE EFFORTS AND ONGOING

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:06.361
MONITORING OF THEIR OUTPUTS,

01:21:06.428 --> 01:21:08.396
BIAS RESULTS CAN GO UNDETECTED

01:21:08.463 --> 01:21:10.265
AND UNCORRECTED, LEADING TO REAL

01:21:10.332 --> 01:21:13.268
HARM AND PATIENT CARE. AS A

01:21:13.335 --> 01:21:14.703
PHYSICIAN, I DO SEE THE PROMISE

01:21:14.769 --> 01:21:17.539
THAT AI HOLDS, BUT ONE OF ITS

01:21:17.606 --> 01:21:18.406
GREATEST CHALLENGES IS THE RISK

01:21:18.473 --> 01:21:20.809
OF PERPETUATING BIAS AND

01:21:20.875 --> 01:21:22.744
INEQUITY WHEN IT IS DEPLOYED

01:21:22.811 --> 01:21:24.779
WITHOUT CAREFUL OVERSIGHT, WE

01:21:24.846 --> 01:21:26.615
KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF BIAS

01:21:26.681 --> 01:21:28.350
ARE SEVERE, INCLUDING SHORTER

01:21:28.416 --> 01:21:30.285
LIFE EXPECTANCIES, HIGHER RATES

01:21:30.352 --> 01:21:32.287
OF INFANT AND MATERNAL

01:21:32.354 --> 01:21:33.722
MORTALITY, PSYCHOLOGICAL

01:21:33.788 --> 01:21:35.223
DISTRESS, CHRONIC LIFE

01:21:35.290 --> 01:21:37.792
THREATENING DISEASES, AND MORE

01:21:37.859 --> 01:21:39.127
FOR MINORITY AND MARGINALIZED

01:21:39.194 --> 01:21:41.229
GROUPS. SEVERAL RESEARCH AND

01:21:41.296 --> 01:21:42.731
HEALTH CARE INSTITUTIONS AND

01:21:42.797 --> 01:21:44.366
ORGANIZATIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS

01:21:44.432 --> 01:21:45.934
HAVE ALREADY BEGUN THE WORK OF

01:21:46.001 --> 01:21:47.769
CREATING PIPELINES THAT WOULD

01:21:47.836 --> 01:21:49.537
ASSIST IN THE IDENTIFYING,

01:21:49.604 --> 01:21:51.273
CORRECTING, AND CONTINUING

01:21:51.339 --> 01:21:52.874
MONITORING OF BIAS IN THEIR

01:21:52.941 --> 01:21:55.410
MODELS. MAJOR LARGE LANGUAGE

01:21:55.477 --> 01:21:57.412
MODEL, OR LLM. COMPANIES AND

01:21:57.479 --> 01:21:59.414
NATIONWIDE COALITIONS RECOGNIZE

01:21:59.481 --> 01:22:01.783
THAT THESE TOOLS CAN REFLECT AND

01:22:01.850 --> 01:22:03.652
PERPETUATE BIAS, AND HAVE TAKEN

01:22:03.718 --> 01:22:05.520
STEPS TO ADDRESS THIS BY

01:22:05.587 --> 01:22:07.989
DEVELOPING BIAS SPECIFIC MODEL

01:22:08.056 --> 01:22:09.524

AND COMPREHENSIVE BENCHMARKS. SB

01:22:14.396 --> 01:22:18.867

01:22:18.933 --> 01:22:20.635
THAT AI TECHNOLOGY USED IN

01:28:37.378 --> 01:28:41.716
VERY BIG GAP IN TERMS OF THE

SITTING RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF

THIS BILL, THIS IS SOMETHING

01:29:31.766 --> 01:29:33.568
THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON

01:29:33.634 --> 01:29:36.504
VERY DILIGENTLY. IT IS A NUANCED

01:29:36.571 --> 01:29:38.606
SPACE. WE ARE ADDRESSING THOSE

01:29:38.673 --> 01:29:40.742
CONCERNS AND AMENDMENTS WHEN WE

01:29:40.808 --> 01:29:42.677
TAKE THEM TO PRIVACY SO THAT WE

01:29:42.744 --> 01:29:46.180
CAN PRODUCE A BILL THAT IS

01:29:46.247 --> 01:29:48.783
IMPLEMENTABLE AND ACTUALLY HAS

01:29:48.850 --> 01:29:50.885
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE AND PREVENTS

01:29:50.952 --> 01:29:53.020
FURTHER HARM. YOU TALKED ABOUT

01:29:53.087 --> 01:29:54.455
THIS BEING DEPLOYED IN THE

01:29:54.522 --> 01:29:55.890
HEALTHCARE SPACE. IT IS DEPLOYED

01:29:55.957 --> 01:29:57.258
IN THE HEALTHCARE SPACE RIGHT

01:29:57.325 --> 01:29:59.494
NOW, AND SOME OF THOSE BIASES

01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:02.730

01:30:02.797 --> 01:30:04.232
WITHIN HOW DIFFERENT PATIENTS

01:30:04.298 --> 01:30:07.068

ALSO HOW THEY ARE PUT INTO

01:30:08.669 --> 01:30:11.472

AND I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE

01:36:33.687 --> 01:36:35.789
COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. MADAM

01:36:35.856 --> 01:36:37.791
CHAIR, COMMITTEE OR CONSULTANTS,

01:36:37.858 --> 01:36:39.193
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WORKING

01:36:39.260 --> 01:36:40.861
WITH ME AND MY TEAM ON THIS. A

01:36:40.928 --> 01:36:42.963
BILL THAT IS REALLY PERSONAL FOR

01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:44.398
ME AND PERSONAL FOR ONE OF MY

01:36:44.465 --> 01:36:45.199
WITNESSES. I'LL BE SPEAKING ON

01:36:45.266 --> 01:36:47.401
HER PERSONAL EXPERIENCE HERE.

01:36:47.468 --> 01:36:49.236
CURRENTLY, RESTAURANTS ARE NOT

01:36:49.303 --> 01:36:50.738
REQUIRED TO LABEL SIGNIFICANT

01:36:50.804 --> 01:36:52.573
FOOD ALLERGENS IN THEIR MENUS,

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:54.575
BUT IF YOU'VE EVER TRAVELED TO

01:36:54.642 --> 01:36:56.410
EUROPE, THEY DO HAVE THAT IN THE

01:36:56.477 --> 01:36:58.979
EU. I GREW UP AS A BUBBLE KID.

01:36:59.046 --> 01:37:00.181
THAT MEANS THAT I WAS ALLERGIC

01:37:00.247 --> 01:37:01.715
TO ALMOST EVERYTHING. GROWING

01:37:01.782 --> 01:37:03.884
UP. I'VE HAD GONE THROUGH

01:37:03.951 --> 01:37:05.085
ANAPHYLAXIS, I'VE BEEN

01:37:05.152 --> 01:37:06.787
INTUBATED, I'VE BEEN IN THE ER,

01:37:06.854 --> 01:37:08.956
I'M ALLERGIC TO ABOUT 70% OF

01:37:09.023 --> 01:37:10.724
FRUIT AND ALL THE NUTS THAT

01:37:10.791 --> 01:37:12.626
EXIST. SO WHEN PEOPLE SAY SNACK

01:37:12.693 --> 01:37:14.628
ON ALMONDS, I CAN'T. I CAN'T DO

01:37:14.695 --> 01:37:16.497
THAT. WHEN I GO TO A RESTAURANT,

01:37:16.564 --> 01:37:18.365
I ALWAYS AM WORRIED ABOUT WHAT

01:37:18.432 --> 01:37:20.301
FOOD AM I PUTTING IN MY SYSTEM?

01:37:20.367 --> 01:37:22.069
I OFTEN ASK THE WAITER, HEY,

01:37:22.136 --> 01:37:23.370
DOES THIS HAVE NUTS? DOES THIS

01:37:23.437 --> 01:37:25.506
HAVE THAT? AND EVEN IN THOSE

01:37:25.573 --> 01:37:26.207
CONVERSATIONS, I'LL STILL BE

01:37:26.273 --> 01:37:28.609
GIVEN A PLATE WITH ALMONDS WITH

01:37:28.676 --> 01:37:30.811
NUTS BECAUSE THEY WILL FORGET.

01:37:30.878 --> 01:37:32.146
WELL, I GET IT. THEY'RE DEALING

01:37:32.213 --> 01:37:34.782
WITH A LOT OF TABLES THAT THEY

01:37:34.848 --> 01:37:36.984
HAVE TO WAIT ON. I GET IT'S NOT

01:37:37.051 --> 01:37:38.052
THEIR RESPONSIBILITY, BUT FOR

01:37:38.118 --> 01:37:40.187
ME, IT'S MY LIVELIHOOD. I NEED

01:37:40.254 --> 01:37:41.522
TO MAKE SURE I KEEP MYSELF

01:37:41.589 --> 01:37:43.457
ALIVE. THE NUT ALLERGY STARTED

01:37:43.524 --> 01:37:45.392
AT THE AGE OF 19 AND I STRUGGLED

01:37:45.459 --> 01:37:47.161
WITH THE I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND. I

01:37:47.228 --> 01:37:49.196
WAS EATING AT RED ROBIN ONCE AND

01:37:49.263 --> 01:37:50.731
I ORDERED A PESTO PASTA AND NOT

01:37:50.798 --> 01:37:51.966
RECOGNIZING, NOT KNOWING THAT

01:37:52.032 --> 01:37:53.234
PESTO IS MADE OUT OF PINE NUTS

01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:55.703
AND LANDED ME IN THE ER WITH MY

01:37:55.769 --> 01:37:57.037
MOM WHO THOUGHT HER DAUGHTER WAS

01:37:57.104 --> 01:37:58.973
GOING TO DIE. AT THAT MOMENT I

01:37:59.039 --> 01:38:01.208
WAS SO AGAIN LEARNING ABOUT MY

01:38:01.275 --> 01:38:02.176
ALLERGIES. I DIDN'T IT DIDN'T

01:38:02.243 --> 01:38:04.411
DAWN ON ME AS A LEGISLATOR THAT

01:38:04.478 --> 01:38:06.146
TWO YEARS AGO I INTRODUCED A

01:38:06.213 --> 01:38:09.016
BILL THAT ADDRESSED THE LACK OF

01:38:09.083 --> 01:38:11.151
AWARENESS OF FOOD ALLERGENS

01:38:11.218 --> 01:38:13.687
UNTIL A NINE YEAR OLD CAME TO MY

01:38:13.754 --> 01:38:15.556
OFFICE AND SAID, HEY, I HAVE

01:38:15.623 --> 01:38:17.358
THESE ALLERGIES. WHAT ARE YOU

01:38:17.424 --> 01:38:19.026
DOING ABOUT IT? I WAS LIKE, OH

01:38:19.093 --> 01:38:21.028
MY GOSH, I HAVE THEM AS WELL,

01:38:21.095 --> 01:38:22.429
AND I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT

01:38:22.496 --> 01:38:23.497
IT. LET'S DO SOMETHING TOGETHER.

01:38:23.564 --> 01:38:25.966
SO AS WE SUCCEED IS LOOKING TO

01:38:26.033 --> 01:38:27.501
DO THAT. IF YOU'RE GOING TO A

01:38:27.568 --> 01:38:29.069
RESTAURANT, A MEDIUM, A SIX OR

01:38:29.136 --> 01:38:30.237
GREATER LOCATIONS OR A LARGE

01:38:30.304 --> 01:38:32.539
CHAIN RESTAURANT THAT WHEN YOU

01:38:32.606 --> 01:38:33.907
GET A MENU THAT ON THE MENU IT

01:38:33.974 --> 01:38:36.610
HAS THE NINE RECOGNIZED

01:38:36.677 --> 01:38:38.212
ALLERGENS TELLING YOU WHAT'S IN

01:38:38.279 --> 01:38:42.883
THERE, SESAME EGGS, DAIRY, NUTS.

01:38:42.950 --> 01:38:45.419
IF THAT RESTAURANT ONLY DOES QR

01:38:45.486 --> 01:38:47.254
CODES FOR THEIR MENUS, AS WE

01:38:47.321 --> 01:38:48.155
KNOW A LOT OF RESTAURANTS DO,

01:38:48.222 --> 01:38:50.824
THEN DO THE QR CODE AND JUST PUT

01:38:50.891 --> 01:38:52.459
IT ON YOUR DIGITAL MENU. BUT NOT

01:38:52.526 --> 01:38:54.028
ALL OF US ARE COMFORTABLE WITH

01:38:54.094 --> 01:38:55.996
QR CODES AND HAVE THAT OTHER

01:38:56.063 --> 01:38:56.764
PAPER MENU AVAILABLE. SHOULD

01:38:56.830 --> 01:38:59.133
YOUR CUSTOMER REQUEST THAT. ARE

01:38:59.199 --> 01:39:01.902
YOU A SMALLER RESTAURANT WITH

01:39:01.969 --> 01:39:03.537
LESS THAN SIX LOCATIONS, THEN

01:39:03.604 --> 01:39:05.039
YOU SHOULD HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY

01:39:05.105 --> 01:39:07.775
WITH THE AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS

01:39:07.841 --> 01:39:09.243
HOW, OR HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY ON

01:39:09.310 --> 01:39:10.911
HOW YOU CAN SHARE WITH YOUR

01:39:10.978 --> 01:39:13.113
CUSTOMERS THE ALLERGENS IN YOUR

01:39:13.180 --> 01:39:15.316
MENU. IS THAT THROUGH A BOOKLET?

01:39:15.382 --> 01:39:18.252
IS IT? IS IT THROUGH A DIFFERENT

01:39:18.319 --> 01:39:20.387
WAY OF DISPLAYING, NOT BEING SO

01:39:20.454 --> 01:39:22.589
RIGID IN HOW WE WANT YOU TO

01:39:22.656 --> 01:39:24.325
DISPLAY IT? NOW, THIS ISN'T THE

01:39:24.391 --> 01:39:26.126
FIRST TIME THIS BODY HAS DONE

01:39:26.193 --> 01:39:27.928
SOMETHING LIKE THIS. THE VERY

01:39:27.995 --> 01:39:29.530
STATE SENATOR THAT HELD THIS

01:39:29.596 --> 01:39:31.165
POSITION, THIS SEAT OF MINE

01:39:31.231 --> 01:39:33.200
ABOUT 15 YEARS AGO, WHO IS NOW

01:39:33.267 --> 01:39:35.736
THE US SENATOR, DID A BILL ON

01:39:35.803 --> 01:39:38.272
NUTRITION LABELING AND SO FORTH.

01:39:38.339 --> 01:39:39.873
AND A LOT OF THE RESTAURANTS

01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:41.475
SAID IT'S GOING TO PUT US ON A

01:39:41.542 --> 01:39:43.010
BUSINESS. WE CAN'T PUT ALL THAT.

01:39:43.077 --> 01:39:45.145
BUT THEY DIDN'T GO OUT OF

01:39:45.212 --> 01:39:45.746
BUSINESS. AND NOW WE GET TO

01:39:45.813 --> 01:39:47.281
ENJOY THE BENEFITS OF LOOKING AT

01:39:47.348 --> 01:39:49.016
THE LABELING OF WHAT'S INSIDE OF

01:39:49.083 --> 01:39:50.918
OUR FOODS THAT WE EAT AT

01:39:50.984 --> 01:39:52.753
RESTAURANTS AND SO FORTH. YOU

01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:53.787
MIGHT HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION

01:39:53.854 --> 01:39:55.389
THAT THIS IS GOING TO PUT THEM

01:39:55.456 --> 01:39:57.358
OUT OF BUSINESS. IT'S SO

01:39:57.424 --> 01:39:58.425
BURDENSOME. IT'S A FALSE SENSE

01:39:58.492 --> 01:40:00.027
OF SECURITY. BUT WE'RE LIVING

01:40:00.094 --> 01:40:01.595
WITH THE FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY

01:40:01.662 --> 01:40:03.497
RIGHT NOW. IF SOMEONE JUST SAYS

01:40:03.564 --> 01:40:05.232
X, Y, AND Z WHEN WE'RE HAVING A

01:40:05.299 --> 01:40:06.233
CONVERSATION, WE RECOGNIZE THAT

01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:09.036
AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT IS OUR

01:40:09.103 --> 01:40:09.903
OWN RESPONSIBILITY TO CARE FOR

01:40:09.970 --> 01:40:11.972
OUR OWN. NO ONE ELSE IS GOING TO

01:40:12.039 --> 01:40:13.974
CARE FOR US AS WE DO OURSELVES.

01:40:14.041 --> 01:40:15.342
BUT THE STUDIES SHOW THAT WHEN

01:40:15.409 --> 01:40:16.276
YOU COUPLE HAVING CONVERSATIONS

01:40:16.343 --> 01:40:18.379
WITH THE WAITRESS WAITER AND

01:40:18.445 --> 01:40:21.115
HAVING AWARENESS ON A MENU, YOU

01:40:21.181 --> 01:40:22.916
SIGNIFICANTLY DROP THE

01:40:22.983 --> 01:40:24.885
PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE HAVING AN

01:40:24.952 --> 01:40:27.388
ALLERGIC REACTION THAT CAN TURN

01:40:27.454 --> 01:40:28.722
FATAL. AND UNFORTUNATELY, A LOT

01:40:28.789 --> 01:40:31.191
OF THE YOUTH, A LOT OF THE

01:40:31.258 --> 01:40:32.593
PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:40:32.659 --> 01:40:34.061
COMING ACROSS WITH FOOD

01:40:34.128 --> 01:40:35.462
ALLERGIES ARE YOUNG KIDS LIKE

01:40:35.529 --> 01:40:38.065
THE PERSON NEXT TO ME. SO WE

01:40:38.132 --> 01:40:41.668
BELIEVE THIS HAS TOUCHED A

01:40:41.735 --> 01:40:43.070
BALANCE THAT IS PROVIDING THE

01:40:43.137 --> 01:40:45.572
FLEXIBILITY FOR RESTAURANTS, BUT

01:40:45.639 --> 01:40:48.842
ALSO SOME SENSE OF SECURITY, NOT

01:40:48.909 --> 01:40:50.811
100, BUT SOME SENSE OF SECURITY

01:40:50.878 --> 01:40:52.413
FOR INDIVIDUALS TO BE ABLE TO GO

01:40:52.479 --> 01:40:55.048
INTO RESTAURANTS AND NOT HAVE TO

01:40:55.115 --> 01:40:58.385
CONSTANTLY BE FIGHTING FOR

01:40:58.452 --> 01:40:59.319
INFORMATION ON WHAT THEY CAN

01:40:59.386 --> 01:41:01.355
EAT. MADAM CHAIR, I'D NOW LIKE

01:41:01.422 --> 01:41:03.624
TO TURN OVER TO MY Kò WITNESSES

01:41:03.690 --> 01:41:06.994
IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL.

01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:11.231
STARTING OFF WITH ADDIE. I'M

01:41:11.298 --> 01:41:12.900
ADDIE. I'M NINE YEARS OLD AND I

01:41:12.966 --> 01:41:15.502
AM IN THIRD GRADE. I'M ALLERGIC

01:41:15.569 --> 01:41:17.971
TO DAIRY, PEANUTS, TREE NUTS AND

01:41:18.038 --> 01:41:19.807
SESAME. I HAVE HAD ANAPHYLACTIC

01:41:19.873 --> 01:41:21.308
FOOD ALLERGIES SINCE I WAS A

01:41:21.375 --> 01:41:23.143
BABY. I ALWAYS HAVE TO BE

01:41:23.210 --> 01:41:24.511
CAREFUL AND CARRY MY EPIPEN

01:41:24.578 --> 01:41:27.047
WHEREVER I GO. BUT MY EPIPEN MAY

01:41:27.114 --> 01:41:29.283
NOT ALWAYS BE ENOUGH. I HAVE TO

01:41:29.349 --> 01:41:31.018
AVOID THE FOODS I'M ALLERGIC TO,

01:41:31.084 --> 01:41:32.052
SINCE IT'S LIKE POISON TO MY

01:41:32.119 --> 01:41:34.054
BODY AND CAN HARM ME. BUT HOW DO

01:41:34.121 --> 01:41:36.757
I KNOW WHAT'S IN MY FOOD TO DINE

01:41:36.824 --> 01:41:38.091
SAFELY AT A STORE? I CAN CHECK

01:41:38.158 --> 01:41:40.461
THE LABEL. THE TOP NINE

01:41:40.527 --> 01:41:42.129
ALLERGENS ARE CLEARLY STATED IN

01:41:42.196 --> 01:41:45.399
BOLD. THIS KEEPS ME SAFE AT A

01:41:45.466 --> 01:41:47.468
RESTAURANT. IT'S HIDDEN LIKE A

01:41:47.534 --> 01:41:49.169
SECRET. PEOPLE MAY THINK IT'S

01:41:49.236 --> 01:41:51.171
EASY TO SPOT MY ALLERGENS LIKE

01:41:51.238 --> 01:41:52.206
AVOID CHEESE AND DON'T DRINK

01:41:52.272 --> 01:41:54.308
MILK. OBVIOUSLY AVOID PEANUT

01:41:54.374 --> 01:41:56.877
BUTTER. NOPE. MY ALLERGENS ARE

01:41:56.944 --> 01:41:58.712
OFTEN HIDDEN CHICKEN NUGGETS

01:41:58.779 --> 01:42:00.547
MADE WITH MILK IN THE BATTER.

01:42:00.614 --> 01:42:02.282
STEAMED VEGGIES WITH BUTTER.

01:42:02.349 --> 01:42:03.617
CASHEWS USED FOR DAIRY FREE

01:42:03.684 --> 01:42:06.620
CHEESE. EVEN MY FAVORITE FOOD

01:42:06.687 --> 01:42:08.121
DUMPLINGS OFTEN HAVE SESAME OIL

01:42:08.188 --> 01:42:11.225
IN IT. OFTENTIMES, I HAVE TO

01:42:11.291 --> 01:42:12.459
PACK SAFE FOOD WHEREVER I GO,

01:42:12.526 --> 01:42:14.561
BUT THIS IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE.

01:42:14.628 --> 01:42:16.129
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO EAT OUT

01:42:16.196 --> 01:42:18.732
WITH MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY LIKE

01:42:18.799 --> 01:42:20.234
EVERYONE ELSE. HOW CAN I PROTECT

01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:22.202
MYSELF? WHEN WE ASK THE WAITER

01:42:22.269 --> 01:42:23.971
THEY DON'T KNOW AND OFTEN NEED

01:42:24.037 --> 01:42:25.839
TO CHECK. MOST OF THE TIME NO

01:42:25.906 --> 01:42:27.574
ONE KNOWS FOR SURE. EVEN WHEN

01:42:27.641 --> 01:42:29.476
THE CHEF KNOWS IT'S LOUD AND

01:42:29.543 --> 01:42:31.178
BUSY AND IT'S LIKE THAT GAME

01:42:31.245 --> 01:42:32.946
TELEPHONE. HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU

01:42:33.013 --> 01:42:35.415
KNOW WHAT THEY TELL YOU IN THE

01:42:35.482 --> 01:42:36.917
END IS TRUE? IF THEY'RE WRONG, I

01:42:36.984 --> 01:42:38.652
WON'T JUST GET A RASH. I WILL

01:42:38.719 --> 01:42:41.288
GET VERY SICK. I COULD DIE. I

01:42:41.355 --> 01:42:42.956
HAVE TO TRUST WHAT THEY SAY WITH

01:42:43.023 --> 01:42:46.126
MY LIFE. THERE MUST BE A BETTER

01:42:46.193 --> 01:42:49.763
WAY. PLEASE PASS SB 68 A.D. SO

01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:51.231
THAT RESTAURANTS WILL LABEL THE

01:42:51.298 --> 01:42:52.933
TOP NINE ALLERGENS ON THEIR

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.969
MENUS. THIS WILL KEEP ME SAFE. I

01:42:56.036 --> 01:42:59.873
WANT TO DINE ALLERGY SAFE. I AM

01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:01.608
ONE OF 4 MILLION PEOPLE IN

01:43:01.675 --> 01:43:03.443
CALIFORNIA WITH FOOD ALLERGIES.

01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:07.381
PLEASE PROTECT US. PLEASE

01:43:07.447 --> 01:43:12.286
PROTECT ME. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

01:43:12.352 --> 01:43:14.354

01:43:14.421 --> 01:43:15.789
THANK YOU. CHAIRWOMAN. MY NAME

01:43:15.856 --> 01:43:17.858

FOUNDATION OF AMERICA. 500

MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS IN

01:43:22.996 --> 01:43:25.566
CALIFORNIA AND 67 STATE AND

01:43:25.632 --> 01:43:26.900
NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS IN

01:43:26.967 --> 01:43:29.770
SUPPORT OF SB 68. CURRENTLY, THE

01:43:29.836 --> 01:43:31.972
RETAIL FOOD CODE FAILS TO SET UP

01:43:32.039 --> 01:43:33.173
GUARDRAILS FOR A PARTICULAR SET

01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:35.108
OF FOOD HAZARDS THAT COULD CAUSE

01:43:35.175 --> 01:43:36.910
VERY SERIOUS ILLNESS AND, IN

01:43:36.977 --> 01:43:39.046
RARE CASES, DEATH. FOOD

01:43:39.112 --> 01:43:41.281
ALLERGENS. IT'S TIME THAT WE

01:43:41.348 --> 01:43:42.816
ADDRESS THIS GLARING GAP IN

01:43:42.883 --> 01:43:44.918
PUBLIC HEALTH HERE IN THE

01:43:44.985 --> 01:43:46.320
LEGISLATURE TO PROTECT ADI.

01:43:46.386 --> 01:43:48.255
SENATOR MENGIBAR AND THE OTHER 4

01:43:48.322 --> 01:43:51.792
MILLION CALIFORNIANS WITH FOOD

01:43:51.858 --> 01:43:55.028
ALLERGIES BY PASSING SB 68,

01:43:55.095 --> 01:43:56.463
BECAUSE THERE IS NO CURE FOR

01:43:56.530 --> 01:43:57.831
THIS CHRONIC DISEASE. THOSE

01:43:57.898 --> 01:44:00.067
AFFECTED MUST ABIDE BY STRICT

01:44:00.133 --> 01:44:02.235
AVOIDANCE. HOWEVER, AVOIDANCE IS

01:44:02.302 --> 01:44:03.403
PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT WHEN YOU

01:44:03.470 --> 01:44:05.973
DO NOT KNOW WHAT'S IN YOUR FOOD.

01:44:06.039 --> 01:44:07.941
SB 68 IS A BILL ABOUT

01:44:08.008 --> 01:44:09.710
TRANSPARENCY. THIS LIFE SAVING

01:44:09.776 --> 01:44:11.511
LEGISLATION ADOPTS THE GLOBAL

01:44:11.578 --> 01:44:13.347
STANDARD OF WRITTEN ALLERGY

01:44:13.413 --> 01:44:14.348
INFORMATION, A PRACTICE THAT HAS

01:44:14.414 --> 01:44:17.117
BEEN MANDATORY IN THE EU AND THE

01:44:17.184 --> 01:44:19.419
UK FOR OVER A DECADE. ASSEMBLY

01:44:19.486 --> 01:44:21.888
MEMBERS I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT

01:44:21.955 --> 01:44:22.956
WRITTEN ALLERGEN INFORMATION

01:44:23.023 --> 01:44:25.959
REDUCES RISK, SUPPORT STAFF AND

01:44:26.026 --> 01:44:28.028
PROTECTS RESTAURANTS. RIGHT NOW,

01:44:28.095 --> 01:44:29.429
CUSTOMERS, AS SENATOR MENGIBAR

01:44:29.496 --> 01:44:31.932
AND ADI DISCUSSED, MUST RELY ON

01:44:31.999 --> 01:44:33.567
CONVERSATIONS WITH WAITSTAFF WHO

01:44:33.634 --> 01:44:35.335
START WITH LITTLE TO NO

01:44:35.402 --> 01:44:36.870
INFORMATION ABOUT THE ALLERGENS

01:44:36.937 --> 01:44:39.339
CONTAINED WITHIN FOODS. SB 68

01:44:39.406 --> 01:44:41.375
GIVES BOTH DINERS AND WAITSTAFF

01:44:41.441 --> 01:44:43.610
A WRITTEN FOUNDATION SO THEY CAN

01:44:43.677 --> 01:44:46.113
HAVE MORE INFORMED CONVERSATIONS

01:44:46.179 --> 01:44:48.248
TO BEST LIMIT RISK AND LIMIT

01:44:48.315 --> 01:44:49.950
LIABILITY. OUR LEGAL ANALYSIS

01:44:50.017 --> 01:44:52.486
SHOWS THAT SB 68 DOES NOT CHANGE

01:44:52.552 --> 01:44:54.388
THE EXISTING LIABILITY UNDER

01:44:54.454 --> 01:44:56.957
CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW. LABELING

01:44:57.024 --> 01:44:58.392
FOR POTENTIAL CROSS-CONTACT WILL

01:44:58.458 --> 01:45:00.227
REMAIN VOLUNTARY UNDER SB 68,

01:45:00.293 --> 01:45:01.595
JUST LIKE IT IS FOR PACKAGED

01:45:01.662 --> 01:45:03.563
FOODS UNDER FEDERAL LAW. PEOPLE

01:45:03.630 --> 01:45:05.532
WHO LIVE WITH ALLERGIES ARE WELL

01:45:05.599 --> 01:45:07.401
AWARE THAT CONVERSATIONS TO

01:45:07.467 --> 01:45:08.802
PREVENT CROSS-CONTACT WILL

01:45:08.869 --> 01:45:11.405
ALWAYS BE NECESSARY, WITH OR

01:45:11.471 --> 01:45:14.775
WITHOUT SB 68. WE SEE SB 68 AS A

01:45:14.841 --> 01:45:16.143
REASONABLE STEP THAT RESTAURANTS

01:45:16.209 --> 01:45:17.411
OF EVERY SIZE CAN TAKE TO

01:45:17.477 --> 01:45:19.913
PROTECT THEIR CUSTOMERS. RITESH

01:45:23.984 --> 01:45:26.286
HE TOLD US THAT IT TOOK HIM TWO

HOURS TO SIT DOWN WITH A CHEF

01:45:29.423 --> 01:45:30.390
AND REDESIGN HIS MENU. THIS TWO

01:45:30.457 --> 01:45:32.392
HOUR INVESTMENT DOES NOT SEEM AN

01:45:32.459 --> 01:45:34.361
UNREASONABLE INCONVENIENCE TO

01:45:34.428 --> 01:45:36.063
AVOID PREVENTABLE DEATHS,

01:45:36.129 --> 01:45:39.366
PROTECT PEOPLE, AND AVOID SEVERE

01:45:39.433 --> 01:45:41.034
REACTIONS FOR A LARGE PROPORTION

01:45:41.101 --> 01:45:43.570

01:45:43.637 --> 01:45:44.538
CELEBRATE CALIFORNIA'S

01:45:44.604 --> 01:45:46.173

AT 18 DIED AT A RESTAURANT

01:46:27.214 --> 01:46:28.982
BECAUSE THERE WAS NO LABELING OF

ANAPHYLACTIC. HE WAS SAVED

01:46:40.660 --> 01:46:42.229
BECAUSE WE GOT HIM TO THE

01:46:43.930 --> 01:46:45.232

AND OF COURSE THE SENATOR AND

01:54:33.233 --> 01:54:36.102
HER STAFF AS WELL. SO I THINK I

01:54:36.169 --> 01:54:38.338
GUESS I WOULD JUST SAY THIS WE

01:54:38.404 --> 01:54:38.972
HAVE A VERY LONG MATT SUTTON

01:54:39.038 --> 01:54:40.440
WITH THE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION.

01:54:40.506 --> 01:54:42.175
WE HAVE RESTAURANTS THAT ARE THE

01:54:42.242 --> 01:54:43.943
LARGE CHAINS, AND THEN THE VAST

01:54:44.010 --> 01:54:45.378
MAJORITY OF OUR RESTAURANTS ARE

01:54:45.445 --> 01:54:46.913
THOSE INDEPENDENT RESTAURANTS.

01:54:46.980 --> 01:54:48.948
SO WE HAVE WORKED IN THIS

01:54:49.015 --> 01:54:50.350
BUILDING FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

01:54:50.416 --> 01:54:51.784
I'VE BEEN WITH THE ASSOCIATION

01:54:51.851 --> 01:54:53.052
FOR A VERY LONG TIME, AND WE'VE

01:54:53.119 --> 01:54:56.556
DONE AT LEAST 2 OR 3 DIFFERENT

01:54:56.623 --> 01:54:57.657
ALLERGY BILLS TO GET OUR SIDE OF

01:54:57.724 --> 01:55:00.326

01:55:02.428 --> 01:55:03.830
TRAINING THAT'S BEEN REQUIRED.

01:55:03.896 --> 01:55:08.067
WE HAVE CONTENT REQUIREMENTS IN

01:55:08.134 --> 01:55:09.135
CERTIFICATIONS FOR RESTAURANT

01:55:09.202 --> 01:55:10.470
STAFF. WE FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT

01:55:10.536 --> 01:55:12.105
WHAT WE'VE DONE. NOW WE'RE AT

01:55:12.171 --> 01:55:13.206
THE STAGE WHERE WE'RE DEALING

01:55:13.273 --> 01:55:15.341
WITH SB 68 AND HOW DO WE

01:55:15.408 --> 01:55:16.442
COMMUNICATE WITH GUESTS. AND SO

01:55:16.509 --> 01:55:18.177
I THINK THERE'S TWO THINGS THAT

01:55:18.244 --> 01:55:19.879
WE'D POINT OUT HERE. WE HAVE PUT

01:55:19.946 --> 01:55:21.714
FORWARD A COMPROMISE WITH

01:55:21.781 --> 01:55:23.549

FINGERTIPS. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:55:29.322 --> 01:55:30.657
PROPOSING. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE

01:55:30.723 --> 01:55:32.458
PROPOSED. THERE'S TWO ISSUES

01:55:32.525 --> 01:55:34.761
THAT HAVE YET TO BE WORKED OUT.

01:55:34.827 --> 01:55:36.029
ONE IS WITH LIABILITY CONCERNS

01:55:36.095 --> 01:55:38.331
AND ONE IS WITH WHAT IS THE

01:55:38.398 --> 01:55:40.066
COMMUNICATION METHOD TO THE

01:55:40.133 --> 01:55:41.801
GUEST? I'LL START WITH THE

01:55:41.868 --> 01:55:42.969
COMMUNICATION METHOD TO THE

01:55:43.036 --> 01:55:44.504
GUEST. WHAT WE HAVE PROPOSED IS

01:55:44.570 --> 01:55:46.906
CALLED THE NATIONAL MODEL FOOD

01:55:46.973 --> 01:55:48.308
CODE. IT IS SOMETHING THAT

01:55:48.374 --> 01:55:49.809
ACTUALLY THIS COMMITTEE AND ITS

01:55:49.876 --> 01:55:51.311
SENATE COUNTERPART SPENT A

01:55:51.377 --> 01:55:52.679
DECENT AMOUNT OF TIME EACH

01:55:52.745 --> 01:55:53.913
SESSION ADOPTING ELEMENTS OF

01:55:53.980 --> 01:55:57.383
THAT FOOD CODE. IT IS THE GOLD

01:55:57.450 --> 01:55:58.851
STANDARD FOR ALLERGEN

01:55:58.918 --> 01:56:00.186
DISCLOSURE, AND WHAT IT DOES IS

01:56:00.253 --> 01:56:04.190
IT ALLOWS FOR 3 OR 4 DIFFERENT

01:56:04.257 --> 01:56:05.291
METHODS, INCLUDING ON MENU,

01:56:05.358 --> 01:56:07.727
INCLUDING BROCHURES, ALLERGEN

01:56:07.794 --> 01:56:09.595
GRIDS. IT'S DIFFERENT RESOURCES

01:56:09.662 --> 01:56:10.930
THAT IT ALLOWS. AND WHAT I'M

01:56:10.997 --> 01:56:12.799
GETTING AT HERE IS WE'RE HAPPY

01:56:12.865 --> 01:56:14.634
TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION. WE

01:56:14.701 --> 01:56:16.436
CANNOT LIVE WITH AN ON MENU

01:56:16.502 --> 01:56:18.538
MANDATE IN EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE.

01:56:18.604 --> 01:56:20.540
THIS MODEL FOOD CODE IS WHAT'S

01:56:20.606 --> 01:56:22.909
USED IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY

01:56:22.975 --> 01:56:25.345
TO COMMUNICATE THE MESSAGE TO

01:56:25.411 --> 01:56:26.145
GUESTS. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:56:26.212 --> 01:56:28.748
ASKING. SB 68 SAYS. YOU CAN HAVE

01:56:28.815 --> 01:56:30.249
THAT FOR SOME RESTAURANTS, BUT

01:56:30.316 --> 01:56:32.819
NOT THE OTHERS. WE'RE SAYING FOR

01:56:32.885 --> 01:56:33.653
CONSISTENCY AND FOR THE BENEFIT

01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:35.655
OF THE DINING CONSUMER TO GIVE

01:56:35.722 --> 01:56:36.989
IT TO EVERYBODY. AND AGAIN, IT'S

01:56:37.056 --> 01:56:38.725
A NATIONAL MODEL. THAT'S WHAT

01:56:38.791 --> 01:56:40.893
WE'RE ASKING FOR. SUPER

01:56:40.960 --> 01:56:42.128
REASONABLE COMMUNICATION METHODS

01:56:42.195 --> 01:56:43.830
TO THE GUEST. THE SECOND PIECE

01:56:43.896 --> 01:56:46.399
IS WITH REGARD TO LIABILITY. WE

01:56:46.466 --> 01:56:47.500
UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF THE

01:56:47.567 --> 01:56:49.235
LIABILITY LANGUAGE THAT WE ASKED

01:56:49.302 --> 01:56:50.603
FOR AND THAT WAS BLESSED BY

01:56:50.670 --> 01:56:51.304
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HAS BEEN

01:56:51.371 --> 01:56:52.872
AGREED TO. BUT THERE'S A

01:56:52.939 --> 01:56:54.507
SENTENCE THAT WAS LEFT OUT.

01:56:54.574 --> 01:56:56.042
THAT'S THE PIECE WE'RE ASKING

01:56:56.109 --> 01:56:57.577
FOR, AND THAT'S THE PIECE THAT

01:56:57.643 --> 01:56:59.078
FITS IN THE SPIRIT OF WHAT WAS

01:56:59.145 --> 01:57:00.813
MENTIONED BEFORE BY THE SENATOR.

01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:02.048
WITH REGARD TO SENATOR, THEN

01:57:02.115 --> 01:57:04.584
ALEX PADILLA'S BILL ON CALORIC

01:57:04.650 --> 01:57:06.853
MENU LABELING. THERE WAS

01:57:06.919 --> 01:57:08.621
LIABILITY INFORMATION LANGUAGE

01:57:08.688 --> 01:57:10.423
PUT IN THERE TO PROTECT

01:57:10.490 --> 01:57:11.891
RESTAURANTS ACTING IN GOOD

01:57:11.958 --> 01:57:13.292
FAITH. THAT'S THE SPIRIT IN

01:57:13.359 --> 01:57:14.727
WHICH THE LANGUAGE WE'VE PUT

01:57:14.794 --> 01:57:17.230
FORWARD MEETS. AND THAT'S WE'RE

01:57:17.296 --> 01:57:18.931
ASKING FOR ONE SENTENCE BACK

01:57:18.998 --> 01:57:20.199
WITH THAT LANGUAGE, AND WE'RE

01:57:20.266 --> 01:57:21.601
ASKING FOR THIS NATIONAL MODEL

01:57:21.667 --> 01:57:24.070
FOOD CODE STRUCTURE TO BE GIVEN

01:57:24.137 --> 01:57:25.405
TO ALL RESTAURANTS AND NOT JUST

01:57:25.471 --> 01:57:27.073
THE SELECT FEW IN THE BILL.

01:57:27.140 --> 01:57:29.108
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

01:57:29.175 --> 01:57:33.312
WITH THAT, ARE THERE ANY IN

01:57:33.379 --> 01:57:34.080
OPPOSITION TO THE BILL IN THE

01:57:34.147 --> 01:57:37.083
HEARING ROOM? SEEING NONE, I

01:57:37.150 --> 01:57:38.751
WILL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE

01:57:38.818 --> 01:57:41.754
FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.

01:57:41.821 --> 01:57:44.290
ASSEMBLY MEMBER EL-HAWARY ADI,

01:57:44.357 --> 01:57:47.126
YOU ARE MY HERO. BUT ALSO I JUST

01:57:47.193 --> 01:57:49.662
REALLY APPRECIATE JUST THE

01:57:49.729 --> 01:57:51.464
IMPORTANCE AND THOUGHTFULNESS OF

01:57:51.531 --> 01:57:53.566
BEING ABLE TO REALLY LOOK AT HOW

01:57:53.633 --> 01:57:57.537
WE ENSURE THAT ALLERGENS ARE ON,

01:57:57.603 --> 01:57:59.138
YOU KNOW, RESTAURANT MENUS,

01:57:59.205 --> 01:57:59.972
ESPECIALLY BEING THOUGHTFUL

01:58:00.039 --> 01:58:01.641
AROUND THE TYPE OF RESTAURANTS.

01:58:01.707 --> 01:58:02.975
BUT I DID WANT TO ASK, JUST IN

01:58:03.042 --> 01:58:04.811
TERMS OF THAT ONE SENTENCE, IF

01:58:04.877 --> 01:58:06.279
THERE ARE THOUGHTS THAT YOU HAVE

01:58:06.345 --> 01:58:08.614
AS THE AUTHOR AROUND WHY THAT

01:58:08.681 --> 01:58:10.216
MIGHT HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT, AND IF

01:58:10.283 --> 01:58:11.684
THERE'S POSSIBILITY OF BEING

01:58:11.751 --> 01:58:13.653
ABLE TO ADD IT. SO WHAT WE DID

01:58:13.719 --> 01:58:16.355
WAS ADDED THE LIABILITY LANGUAGE

01:58:16.422 --> 01:58:17.423
THAT WAS REQUESTED BY US FROM

01:58:17.490 --> 01:58:20.560
OUR CRA. IT DIDN'T HAVE EXACTLY

01:58:20.626 --> 01:58:21.727
EVERYTHING WORD FOR WORD, BUT

01:58:21.794 --> 01:58:23.629
WHAT WE CAME UP WITH WAS AFTER

01:58:23.696 --> 01:58:25.598
IT WAS VETTED BY BOTH THE

01:58:25.665 --> 01:58:28.134
ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE

01:58:28.201 --> 01:58:30.002
JUDICIARY COMMITTEES TO MAKE

01:58:30.069 --> 01:58:32.004
SURE THAT THIS WAS IN LINE WITH

01:58:32.071 --> 01:58:33.206
CURRENT LAW. WHAT WE WEREN'T

01:58:33.272 --> 01:58:35.007
LOOKING TO DO WAS TO DIMINISH

01:58:35.074 --> 01:58:36.809
CURRENT LAW OR ADD TO CURRENT

01:58:36.876 --> 01:58:39.312
LAW. SO THIS IS THE STATUS QUO

01:58:39.378 --> 01:58:40.713
LIABILITY CLAUSE THAT IS

01:58:40.780 --> 01:58:42.248
INCLUDED IN OTHER STATUTES THAT

01:58:42.315 --> 01:58:46.452
WE HAVE. SO WE LEFT IT AS IS AS

01:58:46.519 --> 01:58:51.123
THE STATUS QUO. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:58:51.190 --> 01:58:55.461
SCHIAVO. THANK YOU SO MUCH, FOR

01:58:55.528 --> 01:58:58.030
YOUR LEADERSHIP. SENATOR BAR HAS

01:58:58.097 --> 01:59:00.333
A KNACK FOR FINDING YOUNG,

01:59:00.399 --> 01:59:03.569
BRILLIANT KIDS TO DO BILLS WITH,

01:59:03.636 --> 01:59:05.271
AND I'M REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THIS

01:59:05.338 --> 01:59:08.074
BILL. MY KIDDO HAS A DAIRY

01:59:08.140 --> 01:59:09.909
ALLERGY, AND IT'S TRUE. YOU

01:59:09.976 --> 01:59:12.912
CAN'T I MEAN, I LUCKILY IT'S NOT

01:59:12.979 --> 01:59:14.747
ANAPHYLACTIC, BUT YOU CAN'T

01:59:14.814 --> 01:59:16.516
TRUST WHAT PEOPLE TELL YOU AT

01:59:16.582 --> 01:59:17.250
THE RESTAURANT BECAUSE, YOU

01:59:17.316 --> 01:59:19.352
KNOW, THEY CAN FORGET. THEY CAN

01:59:19.418 --> 01:59:21.420
FORGET A KIND OF FLOUR THAT IS

01:59:21.487 --> 01:59:22.922
USED, OR A LOT OF TIMES THEY

01:59:22.989 --> 01:59:24.757
DON'T THINK OF BUTTER AS DAIRY.

01:59:24.824 --> 01:59:26.759
FOR SOME REASON, I DON'T

01:59:26.826 --> 01:59:29.428
UNDERSTAND WHY. AND YOU KNOW,

01:59:29.495 --> 01:59:32.298
FOR US IT CAN BE A REALLY

01:59:32.365 --> 01:59:33.733
MISERABLE NIGHT AND COMPLETELY

01:59:33.799 --> 01:59:35.101
CHANGE PLANS. AND IF YOU'RE

01:59:35.167 --> 01:59:36.903
TRAVELING, MAKE LIFE VERY, VERY

01:59:36.969 --> 01:59:38.738
DIFFICULT. BUT WHEN WE WERE

01:59:38.804 --> 01:59:40.206
TRAVELING IN EUROPE AND FOUND

01:59:40.273 --> 01:59:43.142
THAT THINGS WERE ON THE MENU, IT

01:59:43.209 --> 01:59:45.344
MADE A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE FOR

01:59:45.411 --> 01:59:47.079
OUR EXPERIENCE TO BE ABLE TO

01:59:47.146 --> 01:59:48.915
TRUST THAT WE COULD, THAT MY KID

01:59:48.981 --> 01:59:51.350
COULD EAT. AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S

01:59:51.417 --> 01:59:53.219
SOMETHING THAT I, YOU KNOW,

01:59:53.286 --> 01:59:53.953
UNFORTUNATELY, WE'RE WE'RE

01:59:54.020 --> 01:59:55.321
BEHIND ON AND WILL MAKE SUCH A

01:59:55.388 --> 01:59:57.089
DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES AND

01:59:57.156 --> 02:00:00.993
LITERALLY PROTECT LIVES. SO VERY

02:00:01.060 --> 02:00:02.395
GRATEFUL FOR THIS BILL. HAPPY TO

02:00:02.461 --> 02:00:04.530
MOVE IT TODAY. ASSEMBLYMEMBER

02:00:04.597 --> 02:00:05.765
GONZALEZ, JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY,

02:00:05.831 --> 02:00:07.934
HAS ANY AND I HAVE NOT READ IF

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:09.101
THAT PARTICULAR PIECE WAS IN

02:00:09.168 --> 02:00:11.037
THERE ON MENU SPECIFICALLY FOR

02:00:11.103 --> 02:00:12.138
ANOTHER LANGUAGES AS WELL, OR IS

02:00:12.204 --> 02:00:14.407
IT JUST IN ENGLISH? THAT'S A

02:00:14.473 --> 02:00:15.441
GREAT QUESTION. ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

02:00:15.508 --> 02:00:17.243
WE HAVEN'T BEEN ASKED A QUESTION

02:00:17.310 --> 02:00:19.178
ON LANGUAGE. IT'S WHATEVER THE

02:00:19.245 --> 02:00:21.047
LANGUAGE OF THE MENU IS, IT'S

02:00:21.113 --> 02:00:22.815
GOING TO BE MATCHING THAT

02:00:22.882 --> 02:00:24.717
LANGUAGE JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY.

02:00:24.784 --> 02:00:25.585
JUST BECAUSE OF SPANISH

02:00:25.651 --> 02:00:27.453
ESPECIALLY, SOMETIMES WE FORGET

02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:29.288
LIKE, OH WAIT, WE ARE ALLERGIC

02:00:29.355 --> 02:00:33.859
TO THAT OR. IS THAT REMEMBER THE

02:00:33.926 --> 02:00:36.295
BILL STAYS AS IS SILENT AND

02:00:36.362 --> 02:00:37.964
DOESN'T SPECIFY ON THAT ISSUE,

02:00:38.030 --> 02:00:39.865
BUT IT ISN'T. THANK YOU FOR

02:00:39.932 --> 02:00:41.300
BRINGING THAT TO OUR ATTENTION.

02:00:41.367 --> 02:00:45.204
CONSIDER AS WELL. WELL, SENATOR,

02:00:45.271 --> 02:00:46.973
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING

02:00:47.039 --> 02:00:48.941
FORWARD THIS BILL. I WANT TO

02:00:49.008 --> 02:00:51.110
ALSO THANK MISS JORDAN FOR YOUR

02:00:51.177 --> 02:00:53.145
TESTIMONY AS WELL. AND I THINK

02:00:53.212 --> 02:00:55.448
JUST TO THE OPPOSITION, WE MR.

02:00:55.514 --> 02:00:58.084
SUTTON, WE WERE WE WENT BACK AND

02:00:58.150 --> 02:01:00.086
FORTH A FEW ROUNDS ON TRYING TO

02:01:00.152 --> 02:01:01.954
STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE WITH

02:01:02.021 --> 02:01:03.990
MAKING SURE THAT WE WEREN'T

02:01:04.056 --> 02:01:05.057
CREATING ANYTHING THAT WAS TOO

02:01:05.124 --> 02:01:06.492
ONEROUS, PARTICULARLY FOR THE

02:01:06.559 --> 02:01:09.028
INDEPENDENT, SMALLER RESTAURANTS

02:01:09.095 --> 02:01:11.631
THAT WE KNOW. YOU KNOW, A SIMPLE

02:01:11.697 --> 02:01:13.466
IT MAY SEEM LIKE A SIMPLE THING

02:01:13.532 --> 02:01:15.134
TO CHANGE A MENU, BUT THERE'S

02:01:15.201 --> 02:01:17.103
DOLLARS AND COSTS AND TIME

02:01:17.169 --> 02:01:18.771
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. AND I

02:01:18.838 --> 02:01:21.140
BELIEVE THAT WE STRUCK A BALANCE

02:01:21.207 --> 02:01:26.479
THAT IS WORKABLE FOR NOW. AND

02:01:26.545 --> 02:01:29.015
WHILE I APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS

02:01:29.081 --> 02:01:32.985
AROUND THE ADDITIONAL SENTENCE,

02:01:33.052 --> 02:01:34.887
FOR THE SAKE OF THE ASSEMBLY

02:01:34.954 --> 02:01:36.489
HEALTH COMMITTEE, THAT ISSUE IS

02:01:36.555 --> 02:01:38.324
KIND OF ASKED AND ANSWERED ON

02:01:38.391 --> 02:01:40.226
THE SENATE SIDE IN JUDICIARY.

02:01:40.292 --> 02:01:42.628
AND WE WERE ABLE TO AMEND KIND

02:01:42.695 --> 02:01:44.997
OF IN ACCORDANCE IN CONCORDANCE

02:01:45.064 --> 02:01:47.299
WITH WHAT HAD ALREADY BEEN

02:01:47.366 --> 02:01:49.035
DISCUSSED WITH ON THE SENATE

02:01:49.101 --> 02:01:51.837
SIDE. AND THAT IS OUR PATTERN OF

02:01:51.904 --> 02:01:53.939
PRACTICE. SO WHILE I APPRECIATE

02:01:54.006 --> 02:01:55.374
THAT, I ALSO THINK THAT THERE'S

02:01:55.441 --> 02:01:56.709
SOME DUPLICATIVE LANGUAGE WITH

02:01:56.776 --> 02:01:58.444
THAT ADDITIONAL SENTENCE THAT

02:01:58.511 --> 02:02:00.379
EXISTS IN CURRENT LAW. AND IT

02:02:00.446 --> 02:02:02.915
FELT LIKE WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE

02:02:02.982 --> 02:02:04.884
SURE THAT THAT NEGLIGENCE

02:02:04.950 --> 02:02:07.486
STANDARD WOULD BE ADDRESSED WITH

02:02:07.553 --> 02:02:13.726
EXISTING LAW. ADI, THANK YOU FOR

STORY. AND I JUST WANT TO SAY

02:02:19.398 --> 02:02:21.167

02:02:21.233 --> 02:02:23.269
MOST WITH ME IN YOUR TESTIMONY

02:02:23.335 --> 02:02:25.805
WAS THIS IDEA THAT I HAVE TO

02:02:25.871 --> 02:02:27.540
TRUST WHAT THEY SAY WITH MY

02:02:27.606 --> 02:02:30.843
LIFE, WHICH IS INCREDIBLY

02:02:30.910 --> 02:02:32.611
POWERFUL, AND THE SIMPLE IDEA OF

02:02:32.678 --> 02:02:34.080
WANTING TO BE ABLE TO DIE IN

02:02:34.146 --> 02:02:36.215
ALLERGEN FREE. I CAN CERTAINLY

02:02:43.289 --> 02:02:44.123
CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAVE TO

GREATEST AMOUNT OF CARE FROM THE

THIS ISN'T THE END ALL, BUT WE

02:03:43.883 --> 02:03:46.852
DO KNOW THAT WHEN CUSTOMERS ARE

02:03:46.919 --> 02:03:48.354
INFORMED, WHEN CUSTOMERS INFORM

02:03:48.420 --> 02:03:50.790
THEIR STAFF, WHEN CUSTOMERS

DOWN TO 26.6% WHEN YOU COMBINE,

02:04:05.471 --> 02:04:06.605
SHOWING IT ON THE MENU AND

02:04:06.672 --> 02:04:08.440
HAVING A CONVERSATION, IT DROPS

02:04:08.507 --> 02:04:11.377
DOWN TO 13 TO 14%. IT'S A

MAKE CALIFORNIA END OF LIFE

02:13:15.587 --> 02:13:18.724
OPTION ACT PERMANENT IN 2021. I

02:13:18.790 --> 02:13:19.991
TESTIFIED BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE

02:13:20.058 --> 02:13:22.527
ABOUT MY PARTNER OF 37 YEARS,

02:13:22.594 --> 02:13:23.428
WILL. THAT SUMMER, HE WAS

02:13:23.495 --> 02:13:24.863
DIAGNOSED WITH A MOTOR NEURON

02:13:24.930 --> 02:13:26.298
DISEASE, NOW THOUGHT TO BE A

02:13:26.365 --> 02:13:28.266
RARE COMPLICATION OF LONG COVID.

02:13:28.333 --> 02:13:29.935
WITHIN MONTHS, HE LOST HIS

02:13:30.001 --> 02:13:32.537
ABILITY TO WALK AND SPEAK AND

02:13:32.604 --> 02:13:33.572
EVENTUALLY EVEN TO BREATHE ON

02:13:33.638 --> 02:13:37.075
HIS OWN. WILL WAS A BRILLIANT

02:13:37.142 --> 02:13:38.643
PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENTIST, SERVING

02:13:38.710 --> 02:13:40.479
THE GOVERNMENT FOR OVER 40 YEARS

02:13:40.545 --> 02:13:42.848
AND A DEEPLY LOVING FATHER, AND

02:13:42.914 --> 02:13:45.050
AFTER LEARNING HIS DIAGNOSIS WAS

02:13:45.117 --> 02:13:46.284
TERMINAL, HE TURNED TO ME AND

02:13:46.351 --> 02:13:47.519
SAID, KATHERINE, IF YOU HADN'T

02:13:47.586 --> 02:13:49.421
WORKED ON THIS ON AID IN DYING

02:13:49.488 --> 02:13:51.056
LAWS, I WOULD BE LIVING EVERY

02:13:51.123 --> 02:13:53.592
LAST DAY OF MY LIFE. ABSOLUTELY

02:13:53.658 --> 02:13:55.394
TERRIFIED. THE LAW GAVE HIM THE

02:13:55.460 --> 02:13:57.295
PEACE TO FOCUS ON THE TIME HE

02:13:57.362 --> 02:14:02.367
HAD AND LEFT WITH OUR OUR

02:14:02.434 --> 02:14:03.468
CHILDREN. EVEN WITH ACCESS TO

02:14:03.535 --> 02:14:06.238
EXCELLENT CARE, WILL FACE STILL

02:14:06.304 --> 02:14:08.006
FACED BARRIERS. OUR PRIMARY

02:14:08.073 --> 02:14:09.374
HEALTH SYSTEM DIDN'T

02:14:09.441 --> 02:14:10.509
PARTICIPATE, WHICH MEANT DELAYS

02:14:10.575 --> 02:14:12.711
THAT CAUSED HIM INTENSE ANXIETY.

02:14:12.778 --> 02:14:14.246
WHETHER HE'D GET THE MEDICATION

02:14:14.312 --> 02:14:17.482
IN TIME. AND THANKFULLY HE DID.

02:14:17.549 --> 02:14:18.784
ONE MORNING, AFTER A

02:14:18.850 --> 02:14:20.619
PARTICULARLY TERRIFYING NIGHT OF

02:14:20.685 --> 02:14:22.387
CHOKING AND GASPING, HE

02:14:22.454 --> 02:14:24.890
WHISPERED TO ME, GATHER THE

02:14:24.956 --> 02:14:28.193
KIDS. I'M READY. WE ROLLED HIS

02:14:28.260 --> 02:14:29.594
BED OUTSIDE AND SURROUNDED BY

02:14:29.661 --> 02:14:31.396
TREES AND HIS LOVED ONES, HE

02:14:31.463 --> 02:14:33.932
DIED PEACEFULLY. THE

02:14:33.999 --> 02:14:35.500
COMPASSIONATE OPTION GAVE WILL

02:14:35.567 --> 02:14:37.636
BACK A SENSE OF CONTROL, EVEN AS

02:14:37.702 --> 02:14:38.737
EVERYTHING ELSE WAS SLIPPING

02:14:38.804 --> 02:14:42.240
AWAY. BUT UNLESS YOU PASS SB

02:14:42.307 --> 02:14:44.709
403, THIS LAW WILL EXPIRE IN

02:14:44.776 --> 02:14:45.977
2021. AND THAT MEANS FAMILIES

02:14:46.044 --> 02:14:48.713
LIKE MINE AND PATIENTS LIKE WILL

02:14:48.780 --> 02:14:50.615
WILL FACE FEAR AND UNCERTAINTY

02:14:50.682 --> 02:14:51.950
ABOUT WHETHER THEY'D BE ALLOWED

02:14:52.017 --> 02:14:53.819
THIS OPTION WHEN THEY NEED IT

02:14:53.885 --> 02:14:55.921
MOST. SINCE THE CALIFORNIA END

02:14:55.987 --> 02:14:57.556
OF LIFE OPTION ACT WENT INTO

02:14:57.622 --> 02:14:59.391
EFFECT IN 2016, DATA COLLECTED

02:14:59.458 --> 02:15:01.993
BY THE CDF SHOWS THAT THE LAW

02:15:02.060 --> 02:15:03.361
WORKED AS INTENDED FOR THOSE WHO

02:15:03.428 --> 02:15:05.664
CAN ACCESS IT. THIS ALIGNS WITH

02:15:05.730 --> 02:15:07.799
NEARLY 30 YEARS OF NATIONAL DATA

02:15:07.866 --> 02:15:09.234
ON THE EFFECTIVENESS AND SAFETY

02:15:09.301 --> 02:15:11.470
OF AID IN DYING LAWS, AND SINCE

02:15:11.536 --> 02:15:13.371
THE LAW WENT INTO EFFECT, OVER

02:15:13.438 --> 02:15:15.807
4000 INDIVIDUALS HAVE UTILIZED

02:15:15.874 --> 02:15:17.609
MEDICAL AID IN DYING AND OVER

02:15:17.676 --> 02:15:18.910
90% WERE ENROLLED IN HOSPICE OR

02:15:18.977 --> 02:15:21.847
PALLIATIVE CARE AT THE TIME, AS

02:15:21.913 --> 02:15:24.483
WAS MY HUSBAND. THERE HAVE BEEN

02:15:24.549 --> 02:15:25.517
ZERO COMPLAINTS OR ALLEGATIONS

02:15:25.584 --> 02:15:29.454
OF COERCION IN THAT TIME. SB 403

02:15:29.521 --> 02:15:30.922
ONLY REMOVES THE SUNSET

02:15:30.989 --> 02:15:32.991
PROVISION AND KEEPS ALL OTHER

ELIGIBILITY, AND OPPORTUNITIES

02:15:39.931 --> 02:15:41.366
FOR PATIENTS TO CHANGE THEIR

02:15:41.433 --> 02:15:43.502
MIND. THE CONTINUATION OF THE

02:15:43.568 --> 02:15:44.536
OPTION OF MEDICAL AID IN DYING

02:15:44.603 --> 02:15:47.072
IS CRUCIAL FOR AGENCY AT THE END

02:15:47.138 --> 02:15:49.541

02:15:49.608 --> 02:15:51.109

FOR TELLING YOUR STORIES,

02:20:25.416 --> 02:20:26.417
SENATOR BLAKE SPEER. I KNOW THAT

02:20:26.484 --> 02:20:28.386
THIS HAS BEEN A PASSION PROJECT

02:20:28.453 --> 02:20:32.157
OF YOURS FOR QUITE A WHILE. I'M

02:20:32.223 --> 02:20:35.059
VERY THANKFUL THAT WE ARE ABLE

02:20:35.126 --> 02:20:37.262
TO ADDRESS, HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

02:20:37.328 --> 02:20:39.330
ADDRESS ANY OF THE CONCERNS OR

02:20:39.397 --> 02:20:40.465
CONSIDERATIONS THAT THE

02:20:40.532 --> 02:20:42.233
COMMITTEE HAD ON THIS BILL, AND

02:20:42.300 --> 02:20:44.669
I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES

02:20:44.736 --> 02:20:48.072
FOR MAKING SURE TO WEIGH THE

02:20:48.139 --> 02:20:50.975
IMPACT OF THIS BILL WITH THE

02:20:51.042 --> 02:20:52.777
CARE THAT IT DESERVES. SENATOR,

02:20:52.844 --> 02:20:55.146
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE? YES,

02:20:55.213 --> 02:20:57.382
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FIRST, I'D

02:20:57.448 --> 02:20:59.284
LIKE TO THANK MY WITNESSES FOR

02:20:59.350 --> 02:21:00.985
SHARING THEIR PERSONAL STORY AND

02:21:01.052 --> 02:21:02.787
GIVING US SOME INSIGHT INTO WHAT

02:21:02.854 --> 02:21:05.256
IT LOOKS LIKE IN TWO MINUTES TO

02:21:05.323 --> 02:21:08.193
GO THROUGH THAT. AND I'LL JUST

02:21:08.259 --> 02:21:10.728
SHARE THAT I COME TO THIS TOPIC

02:21:10.795 --> 02:21:12.797
FROM HAVING JUST HAD

02:21:12.864 --> 02:21:13.631
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

02:21:13.698 --> 02:21:15.066
GENERATION ABOVE ME, MY FAMILY

02:21:15.133 --> 02:21:18.736
MEMBERS, ABOUT THEIR LIVES WHEN

02:21:18.803 --> 02:21:19.971
THEY LOOK FORWARD, BUT ALSO

02:21:20.038 --> 02:21:21.906
HAVING WORKED AS AN ESTATE

02:21:21.973 --> 02:21:23.374
PLANNING ATTORNEY AND DRAFTED

02:21:23.441 --> 02:21:25.076
WILLS AND TRUSTS AND POWERS OF

02:21:25.143 --> 02:21:26.177
ATTORNEY AND ADVANCED HEALTH

02:21:26.244 --> 02:21:28.079
CARE DIRECTIVES, AND HAD A LOT

02:21:28.146 --> 02:21:30.114
OF CONVERSATIONS WITH CLIENTS

02:21:30.181 --> 02:21:32.951
ABOUT THIS TOPIC. AND AS PEOPLE

02:21:33.017 --> 02:21:35.453
ARE PLANNING FOR THEIR EXIT,

02:21:35.520 --> 02:21:37.188
THEIR THEIR FINAL EXIT, THEY

02:21:37.255 --> 02:21:38.756
THINK ABOUT THE WHOLE RANGE OF

02:21:38.823 --> 02:21:40.892
THINGS, INCLUDING HOW MUCH

02:21:40.959 --> 02:21:42.760
AUTONOMY AND CONTROL AND MEDICAL

02:21:42.827 --> 02:21:44.562
DECISION MAKING THEY THEY WILL

02:21:44.629 --> 02:21:47.098
HAVE IF THEY DO HAVE A TERMINAL

02:21:47.165 --> 02:21:49.634
ILLNESS OR IF THEY DON'T. AND SO

02:21:49.701 --> 02:21:51.436
THE REALITY IS THAT WHAT WE'RE

02:21:51.502 --> 02:21:53.137
DOING TODAY IS RELATIVELY

02:21:53.204 --> 02:21:54.172
MODEST, AND THAT IT'S NOT

02:21:54.239 --> 02:21:56.074
EXPANDING THIS LAW AT ALL. IT'S

02:21:56.140 --> 02:21:57.876
JUST ELIMINATING THE SUNSET ON A

02:21:57.942 --> 02:22:00.044
LAW THAT'S BEEN WORKING WELL FOR

02:22:00.111 --> 02:22:01.779
TEN YEARS. SO RECOGNIZING THAT

02:22:01.846 --> 02:22:04.015
WE HAVE PROVIDED THE OPTION FOR

02:22:04.082 --> 02:22:06.251
PEOPLE WITH A TERMINAL ILLNESS

02:22:06.317 --> 02:22:07.518
WHO ARE WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF

02:22:07.585 --> 02:22:09.754
DEATH TO ACCESS MEDICATION, THAT

02:22:09.821 --> 02:22:11.789
GIVES THEM THE CHOICE TO TAKE IT

02:22:11.856 --> 02:22:13.725
IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE HAVE.

02:22:13.791 --> 02:22:15.026
THEY SUFFER WITH THINGS THAT

02:22:15.093 --> 02:22:17.228
WILL HAPPEN YEARS IN ADVANCE, AS

02:22:17.295 --> 02:22:18.663
ONE OF MY WITNESSES DESCRIBED.

02:22:18.730 --> 02:22:20.832
AND SO THERE IS ANXIETY THAT

02:22:20.899 --> 02:22:22.500
COMES UP. IF PEOPLE ARE THINKING

02:22:22.567 --> 02:22:24.168
THAT THIS LAW MIGHT EXPIRE. SO

02:22:24.235 --> 02:22:26.271
IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME AND TO MANY

02:22:26.337 --> 02:22:28.339
THAT WE ELIMINATE THE SUNSET AND

02:22:28.406 --> 02:22:30.041
THAT WE ARE THEN IN LINE WITH

02:22:30.108 --> 02:22:32.010
THE 12 OTHER STATES THAT HAVE

02:22:32.076 --> 02:22:33.778
THIS LAW AND DON'T HAVE A

02:22:33.845 --> 02:22:35.680
SUNSET. AND SO WITH THAT, I WILL

02:22:35.747 --> 02:22:38.149
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

02:22:38.216 --> 02:22:39.217
THANK YOU. SENATOR, WE HAVE A

CHAIR. I'M HERE TO PRESENT

02:26:58.509 --> 02:27:00.444
SENATE BILL 41, WHICH WILL

02:27:00.511 --> 02:27:03.014
REQUIRE TRANSPARENCY AND REIN IN

02:27:03.080 --> 02:27:05.283
ABUSIVE PRACTICES BY PHARMACY

02:27:05.349 --> 02:27:07.785
BENEFIT MANAGERS THAT ARE

02:27:07.852 --> 02:27:08.819
ESCALATING THE COST OF

02:27:08.886 --> 02:27:10.988
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND KILLING

02:27:11.055 --> 02:27:14.225
COMMUNITY PHARMACIES. I WANT TO

02:27:14.292 --> 02:27:17.161
NOTE THAT RECENT AMENDMENTS

02:27:17.228 --> 02:27:18.963
CONFORM THE BILL TO THE HEALTH

02:27:19.030 --> 02:27:21.032
TRAILER BILL THAT CREATED

02:27:21.098 --> 02:27:22.867
LICENSURE FOR PBMS, AND WE'RE

02:27:22.934 --> 02:27:25.036
GRATEFUL TO THE ADMINISTRATION

02:27:25.102 --> 02:27:28.206
FOR ITS COLLABORATION. AND SO

02:27:28.272 --> 02:27:30.641
SHOULD THE BILL PASS OUT TODAY,

02:27:30.708 --> 02:27:34.812
WE WILL AMEND THE LICENSURE OUT

02:27:34.879 --> 02:27:36.948
OF THIS BILL AS IT IS EXISTING

02:27:37.014 --> 02:27:39.483
LAW. AND I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE

02:27:39.550 --> 02:27:40.985
AMENDMENTS IN THE COMMITTEE

02:27:41.052 --> 02:27:47.058
ANALYSIS AS WELL. SO PBMS

02:27:47.124 --> 02:27:48.459
STARTED OUT AS SMALL

02:27:48.526 --> 02:27:49.627
ADMINISTRATIVE ENTITIES CREATED

02:27:49.694 --> 02:27:52.129
BY HEALTH PLANS TO HELP PUT

02:27:52.196 --> 02:27:54.665
TOGETHER THEIR FORMULARIES. AND

02:27:54.732 --> 02:27:56.334
IT WAS AN ADMINISTRATIVE

02:27:56.400 --> 02:27:58.869
FUNCTION. FAST FORWARD SEVERAL

02:27:58.936 --> 02:28:01.839
DECADES, AND PBMS ARE NOW

02:28:01.906 --> 02:28:05.042
CORPORATE BEHEMOTHS THAT ARE

02:28:05.109 --> 02:28:06.944
OFTEN BIGGER THAN THE HEALTH

02:28:07.011 --> 02:28:09.547
PLANS AND, FRANKLY, ARE COMBINED

02:28:09.614 --> 02:28:11.015
WITH HEALTH PLANS OR OAN HEALTH

02:28:11.082 --> 02:28:13.317
PLANS. THEY OWN THEIR OWN

02:28:13.384 --> 02:28:14.652
PHARMACIES, MAIL ORDER

02:28:14.719 --> 02:28:16.787
PHARMACIES THAT THEY EFFECTIVELY

02:28:16.854 --> 02:28:18.623
TRY TO FORCE CONSUMERS TO USE

02:28:18.689 --> 02:28:21.158
INSTEAD OF COMMUNITY PHARMACIES.

02:28:21.225 --> 02:28:22.627
THEY'VE STRUCTURED THEIR

02:28:22.693 --> 02:28:24.095
COMPENSATION IN A WAY WHERE THE

02:28:24.161 --> 02:28:25.863
HIGHER THE DRUG PRICE, THE MORE

02:28:25.930 --> 02:28:27.698
MONEY THEY MAKE BECAUSE OF THE

02:28:27.765 --> 02:28:29.867
WAY REBATES ARE STRUCTURED. AND

02:28:29.934 --> 02:28:33.738
IT'S JUST A SERIES OF ABUSIVE

02:28:33.804 --> 02:28:35.306
PRACTICES THAT ARE NOT TO THE

02:28:35.373 --> 02:28:37.308
BENEFIT OF PATIENTS AND NOT TO

02:28:37.375 --> 02:28:39.610
THE BENEFIT OF COSTS OR

02:28:39.677 --> 02:28:41.379
CONTAINING COSTS IN THE HEALTH

02:28:41.445 --> 02:28:43.347
CARE SYSTEM. AND THE DESTRUCTION

02:28:43.414 --> 02:28:45.616
OF COMMUNITY PHARMACIES IS VERY

02:28:45.683 --> 02:28:48.486
SEVERE, BECAUSE PHARMACISTS PLAY

02:28:48.552 --> 02:28:50.721
A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE HEALTH

02:28:50.788 --> 02:28:51.789
CARE SYSTEM. AND WHILE SOME

02:28:51.856 --> 02:28:54.325
PEOPLE MAY WANT TO DO A MAIL

02:28:54.392 --> 02:28:55.726
ORDER PHARMACY, FOR MANY PEOPLE,

02:28:55.793 --> 02:28:58.195
THAT SIMPLY DOESN'T WORK. AND

02:28:58.262 --> 02:28:59.964
THE PRACTICES WITH PHARMACIES

02:29:00.031 --> 02:29:01.432
ARE, I THINK, PARTICULARLY

02:29:01.499 --> 02:29:03.267
ABUSIVE FOR ANYONE WHO'S EVER

02:29:03.334 --> 02:29:04.835
HAD A SITUATION WHERE YOU'RE

02:29:04.902 --> 02:29:07.438
TOLD THAT IF YOU GO THROUGH THE

02:29:07.505 --> 02:29:09.006
MAIL ORDER, YOU GET 90 DAY

02:29:09.073 --> 02:29:11.242
SUPPLY. IF YOU WANT TO GO TO

02:29:11.309 --> 02:29:11.976
YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD PHARMACY, YOU

02:29:12.043 --> 02:29:14.011
ONLY GET A 30 DAY SUPPLY. THAT'S

02:29:14.078 --> 02:29:15.713
ONE OF THE PRACTICES PBMS USE TO

02:29:15.780 --> 02:29:18.149
TRY TO EFFECTIVELY FORCE PEOPLE

02:29:18.215 --> 02:29:20.651
TO USE THEIR MAIL ORDER

02:29:20.718 --> 02:29:22.453
PHARMACIES. THERE IS BROAD

02:29:22.520 --> 02:29:24.355
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR ENDING

02:29:24.422 --> 02:29:26.724
THESE PRACTICES, AND BOTH IN

02:29:26.791 --> 02:29:28.459
CONGRESS AND IN THIS

02:29:28.526 --> 02:29:32.496
LEGISLATURE, AND THIS BILL WILL

02:29:32.563 --> 02:29:34.632
PROHIBIT PRACTICES THAT STEER

02:29:34.699 --> 02:29:38.269
PATIENTS TOWARDS PBMS OWN MAIL

02:29:38.336 --> 02:29:40.338
ORDER PHARMACIES AND AWAY FROM

02:29:40.404 --> 02:29:42.139
COMMUNITY PHARMACIES. IT WILL

02:29:42.206 --> 02:29:44.241
ALSO MOVE AWAY FROM SPREAD

02:29:44.308 --> 02:29:47.978
PRICING AND WILL REQUIRE WILL

02:29:48.045 --> 02:29:49.680
PREVENT PBMS FROM POCKETING A

02:29:49.747 --> 02:29:51.082
PORTION OF REBATES, WHICH IS

02:29:51.148 --> 02:29:53.417
WHAT GIVES THEM THE INCENTIVE TO

02:29:53.484 --> 02:29:56.587
FAVOR HIGH COST DRUGS. AND, OF

02:29:56.654 --> 02:29:57.988
COURSE, LICENSURE, WHICH IS NOW

02:29:58.055 --> 02:30:00.491
PART OF THE BUDGET. THIS IS A

02:30:00.558 --> 02:30:02.727
REFORM THAT IS WAY, WAY, WAY

02:30:02.793 --> 02:30:04.228
OVERDUE. THIS COMMITTEE PASSED

02:30:04.295 --> 02:30:06.664
IN THE LEGISLATURE, PASSED A

02:30:06.731 --> 02:30:08.933
SIMILAR BILL LAST YEAR. WHILE

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:13.070
THE GOVERNOR DID VETO IT, WERE

02:30:13.137 --> 02:30:14.004
OPTIMISTIC THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO

02:30:14.071 --> 02:30:15.673
WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION,

02:30:15.740 --> 02:30:17.608
PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE LICENSURE

02:30:17.675 --> 02:30:19.343
BEING PLACED IN THE BUDGET, AND

02:30:19.410 --> 02:30:21.379
WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT

02:30:21.445 --> 02:30:22.947
CONVERSATION. SO WITH THAT, I

CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I AM DOCTOR

02:30:41.465 --> 02:30:42.666
CLINT HOPKINS, PHARMACIST AND

02:30:42.733 --> 02:30:43.834
OWNER OF PUCCI'S PHARMACY,

02:30:43.901 --> 02:30:44.835
INDEPENDENTLY OWNED HERE IN

02:30:44.902 --> 02:30:47.037
SACRAMENTO SINCE 1930. PBMS NOW

02:30:47.104 --> 02:30:48.272
DOMINATE NOT ONLY THE PHARMACY

02:30:48.339 --> 02:30:49.540
MARKET, BUT ALSO THE HEALTH CARE

02:30:49.607 --> 02:30:51.308
MARKET AT LARGE. THEY OWN THE

02:30:51.375 --> 02:30:52.309
HEALTH PLANS, THE PHARMACY DOWN

02:30:52.376 --> 02:30:53.844
THE STREET, THE MAIL ORDER

02:30:53.911 --> 02:30:55.946
PHARMACY TO WHERE THEY STEER OUR

02:30:56.013 --> 02:30:57.348
PATIENTS, AND THEY DICTATE

02:30:57.415 --> 02:30:58.215
CONTRACTS THAT UNDERPAY AND

02:30:58.282 --> 02:30:58.883
FORCE PHARMACIES TO CLOSE. EVEN

02:30:58.949 --> 02:30:59.917
BEFORE THE RITE AID CLOSURES,

02:30:59.984 --> 02:31:01.018
THERE WERE NUMEROUS OTHER

02:31:01.085 --> 02:31:01.619
COMMUNITY PHARMACIES CLOSING

02:31:01.685 --> 02:31:03.287
THEIR DOORS CREATING PHARMACY

02:31:03.354 --> 02:31:05.389
DESERTS. WE DO OUR BEST TO CARE

02:31:05.456 --> 02:31:06.524
FOR THESE PATIENTS, BUT TOO

02:31:06.590 --> 02:31:07.391
OFTEN WE HAVE TO EXPLAIN THAT

02:31:07.458 --> 02:31:09.293
THE DRUGS THEY TAKE ARE BEING

02:31:09.360 --> 02:31:10.394
REIMBURSED BELOW THE ACQUISITION

02:31:10.461 --> 02:31:13.631
COST. A LARGE PART OF THE REASON

02:31:13.697 --> 02:31:14.231
THAT THEIR PREVIOUS PHARMACY

02:31:14.298 --> 02:31:14.832
CLOSED THEIR DOORS EVERY DAY.

02:31:14.899 --> 02:31:16.434
SEEMS WE SPEND MORE TIME

02:31:16.500 --> 02:31:17.568
EXPLAINING TO PATIENTS WE CANNOT

02:31:17.635 --> 02:31:18.669
HELP, WHY WE CANNOT HELP THEM,

02:31:18.736 --> 02:31:20.204
AND TRYING TO HELP THEM NAVIGATE

02:31:20.271 --> 02:31:22.006
THE SYSTEM THAN WE DO COUNSELING

02:31:22.072 --> 02:31:22.907
PATIENTS WHO ARE ACTUALLY

02:31:22.973 --> 02:31:23.507
PICKING UP MEDICATIONS FROM

02:31:23.574 --> 02:31:25.409
PHARMACIES. PBMS LIMIT DRUGS

02:31:25.476 --> 02:31:26.577
WHICH CAN BE DISPENSED LOCALLY

02:31:26.644 --> 02:31:28.345
AND RESERVE THE MOST PROFITABLE

02:31:28.412 --> 02:31:29.480
DRUGS FOR DISPENSING FROM THEIR

02:31:29.547 --> 02:31:31.081
OWN PHARMACIES. JUST YESTERDAY,

02:31:31.148 --> 02:31:33.117
WE WERE CONTACTED BY A PATIENT

02:31:33.184 --> 02:31:34.852
WHO WAS FORCED TO USE A PBM

02:31:34.919 --> 02:31:36.086
OWNED MAIL ORDER PHARMACY FOR

02:31:36.153 --> 02:31:37.721
HIS SPECIALTY MEDICATION. THIS

02:31:37.788 --> 02:31:39.056
PATIENT HAPPENS TO BE A FEDERAL

02:31:39.123 --> 02:31:39.924
EMPLOYEE WHO IS FORCED TO USE

02:31:39.990 --> 02:31:41.625
THE PBM OWNED CAREMARK PHARMACY,

02:31:41.692 --> 02:31:43.160
WHO MANAGES THE BENEFITS FOR

02:31:43.227 --> 02:31:45.262
FEDERAL EMPLOYEES. HIS

02:31:45.329 --> 02:31:46.197
MEDICATION IS A GENERIC THAT

02:31:46.263 --> 02:31:47.765
DOESN'T COST VERY MUCH. HE'S NOT

02:31:47.832 --> 02:31:48.799
HAPPY WITH THE MAIL SERVICE.

02:31:48.866 --> 02:31:50.901
HE'S RUN OUT OF MEDS MULTIPLE

02:31:50.968 --> 02:31:52.136
TIMES DUE TO THEIR DELAYS,

02:31:52.203 --> 02:31:53.137
MISSING DOSES AND PUTTING HIM AT

02:31:53.204 --> 02:31:54.905
RISK OF DISEASE, WHICH COULD BE

02:31:54.972 --> 02:31:56.040
PREVENTED BY ALLOWING HIM LOCAL

02:31:56.106 --> 02:31:57.441
PHARMACY ACCESS. AND THEN THE

02:31:57.508 --> 02:31:58.075
KICKER? THEY'VE BEEN CHARGING

02:31:58.142 --> 02:31:59.977
HIM A $60 COPAY EACH MONTH WHEN

02:32:00.044 --> 02:32:01.579
HE COULD BE JUST PAYING $50 CASH

02:32:01.645 --> 02:32:03.881
OUT OF POCKET FOR THIS SPECIALTY

02:32:03.948 --> 02:32:05.182
MEDICATION FROM A LOCAL PHARMACY

02:32:05.249 --> 02:32:06.851
LIKE MINE OR SONIA'S, AND HAD

02:32:06.917 --> 02:32:08.619
THE MEDICATION THE SAME DAY.

02:32:08.686 --> 02:32:10.020
UNFORTUNATELY, HE'S NOT AN

02:32:10.087 --> 02:32:12.156
EXCEPTION. JUST LAST WEEK,

02:32:12.223 --> 02:32:13.357
ANOTHER PATIENT, A CHILD OF

02:32:13.424 --> 02:32:15.459
EIGHT MONTHS OLD WHO IS BEING

02:32:15.526 --> 02:32:17.228
FORCED TO USE SPECIALTY PHARMACY

02:32:17.294 --> 02:32:17.795
FOR SILDENAFIL, LIQUID FOR

02:32:17.862 --> 02:32:19.029
PULMONARY HYPERTENSION. THE

02:32:19.096 --> 02:32:20.865
AVERAGE PHARMACY WOULD CHARGE

02:32:20.931 --> 02:32:22.833
AROUND $120 FOR A BOTTLE OF THIS

02:32:22.900 --> 02:32:23.601
MEDICATION. WE CAN OBSERVE FROM

02:32:23.667 --> 02:32:26.670
CLAIMS DATA THAT CVS WILL LIKELY

02:32:26.737 --> 02:32:27.238
PAY THEMSELVES IN EXCESS OF

02:32:27.304 --> 02:32:28.405
$1,300 FOR THE SAME MEDICATION

02:32:28.472 --> 02:32:29.640
SITTING ON THE SHELF IN MY

02:32:29.707 --> 02:32:31.375
PHARMACY, AND HIS PARENTS WILL

02:32:31.442 --> 02:32:32.476
HAVE TO WAIT FOR THIS CRUCIAL

02:32:32.543 --> 02:32:34.144
MEDICATION TO BE SHIPPED FROM A

02:32:34.211 --> 02:32:35.379
MAIL SERVICE PHARMACY IN ANOTHER

02:32:35.446 --> 02:32:37.147
STATE. FOR FAR TOO LONG, PBMS

02:32:37.214 --> 02:32:38.449
HAVE OPERATED IN THE SHADOWS,

02:32:38.516 --> 02:32:39.116
EXTRACTING EXORBITANT AMOUNTS OF

02:32:39.183 --> 02:32:40.384
MONEY FROM THE SYSTEM THEY'VE

02:32:40.451 --> 02:32:41.485
DESIGNED. WITHOUT THIS

02:32:41.552 --> 02:32:42.620
LEGISLATION, PBMS WILL CONTINUE

02:32:42.686 --> 02:32:43.921
TO RUN AFOUL, CAUSING MORE

02:32:43.988 --> 02:32:45.389
PHARMACIES TO CLOSE, LOCAL JOBS

02:32:45.456 --> 02:32:47.157
TO BE LOST AND PATIENTS TO LOSE

02:32:47.224 --> 02:32:48.993
ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IN THEIR

02:32:49.059 --> 02:32:49.960
COMMUNITIES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK

02:32:50.027 --> 02:32:52.363
FOR YOUR VOTE ON SB 41. THANK

02:32:52.429 --> 02:32:56.033
YOU. AND GO AHEAD. MADAM CHAIR,

02:32:56.100 --> 02:32:57.635
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE, I'M

02:32:57.701 --> 02:32:59.336
GOING TO GET EMOTIONAL, SO I

02:32:59.403 --> 02:33:01.238
APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE. MY NAME IS

02:33:01.305 --> 02:33:03.040
SONIA. I'M THE OWNER OF TEN

02:33:03.107 --> 02:33:04.842
ACRES PHARMACY HERE IN THE LAND

02:33:04.909 --> 02:33:06.143
PARK AREA. AS A LOCAL PHARMACY,

02:33:06.210 --> 02:33:07.745
WE ARE DEEPLY ROOTED IN OUR

02:33:07.811 --> 02:33:09.413
COMMUNITY. WE'VE BUILT A

02:33:09.480 --> 02:33:11.015
WELCOMING SPACE WHERE CARE GOES

02:33:11.081 --> 02:33:12.583
BEYOND PRESCRIPTIONS, WHERE

02:33:12.650 --> 02:33:13.751
RELATIONSHIPS ARE BUILT ON

02:33:13.817 --> 02:33:15.619
COMMUNICATION, RESPECT AND

02:33:15.686 --> 02:33:17.388
COMPASSION. I WORK EVERY DAY TO

02:33:17.454 --> 02:33:19.623
EMPOWER MY PATIENTS, BUT IT'S

02:33:19.690 --> 02:33:21.392
BECOME NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO

02:33:21.458 --> 02:33:23.193
FOCUS ON THEIR NEEDS WHILE

02:33:23.260 --> 02:33:25.262
FIGHTING TO KEEP MY DOORS OPEN.

02:33:25.329 --> 02:33:26.797
I'M MANAGING THE PENNIES,

02:33:26.864 --> 02:33:29.366
LITERALLY THE PENNIES, AND

02:33:29.433 --> 02:33:30.334
DETERMINING WHAT MY

02:33:30.401 --> 02:33:31.201
REIMBURSEMENT IS. BECAUSE IT

02:33:31.268 --> 02:33:33.904
COMES DAILY, PBMS OFTEN

02:33:33.971 --> 02:33:35.839
REIMBURSE US UNDER WHAT WE PAID

02:33:35.906 --> 02:33:38.108
FOR THE DRUG. SO I MIGHT PAY

02:33:38.175 --> 02:33:40.110
$105 FOR A DRUG AND BEING

02:33:40.177 --> 02:33:42.613
REIMBURSED $50, WHICH LEAVES ME

02:33:42.680 --> 02:33:44.048
$55 SHORT. THAT DOESN'T EVEN

02:33:44.114 --> 02:33:45.916
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT MY STAFF, MY

02:33:45.983 --> 02:33:48.419
UTILITIES, OR EVEN MY LOANS.

02:33:48.485 --> 02:33:50.554
THIS IS TRULY UNSUSTAINABLE, AND

02:33:50.621 --> 02:33:52.289
IT CREATES A SITUATION WHERE I

02:33:52.356 --> 02:33:53.357
HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER I CAN

02:33:53.424 --> 02:33:54.725
EVEN TAKE CARE OF THIS PATIENT,

02:33:54.792 --> 02:33:58.062
OR I HAVE TO SEND THEM TO A MAIL

02:33:58.128 --> 02:33:59.029
ORDER OR A CHAIN PHARMACY THAT'S

02:33:59.096 --> 02:34:00.431
DOWN THE STREET. THIS IS JUST TO

02:34:00.497 --> 02:34:03.067
KEEP MY DOORS OPEN. THIS IS NOT

02:34:03.133 --> 02:34:05.002
WHAT I SIGNED UP FOR WHEN I

02:34:05.069 --> 02:34:06.804
BECAME A PHARMACIST. AND THIS IS

02:34:06.870 --> 02:34:08.172
NOT WHAT ANY OF US PLEDGED TO DO

02:34:08.238 --> 02:34:10.474
WHEN WE TOOK OUR OATH IN 2024,

02:34:10.541 --> 02:34:12.076
OUR PHARMACY HAD TO LET PATIENTS

02:34:12.142 --> 02:34:13.577
WHO HAD HIV, CANCER, AND HEART

02:34:13.644 --> 02:34:15.045
DISEASE KNOW WE COULD NO LONGER

02:34:15.112 --> 02:34:16.480
FILL THEIR MEDICATIONS BECAUSE

02:34:16.547 --> 02:34:18.682
WE WERE BEING REIMBURSED BELOW

02:34:18.749 --> 02:34:20.684
COST. THESE AREN'T RARE

02:34:20.751 --> 02:34:21.919
SITUATIONS. THEY'RE HAPPENING

02:34:21.986 --> 02:34:23.621
EVERY SINGLE DAY. THE MORE

02:34:23.687 --> 02:34:25.055
PRESCRIPTIONS WE FILL, THE MORE

02:34:25.122 --> 02:34:26.957
MONEY WE LOSE, THE MORE

02:34:27.024 --> 02:34:28.192
FINANCIALLY UNSUSTAINABLE THIS

02:34:28.258 --> 02:34:30.094
IS. NOW WE HAVE FOUR PHARMACIES

02:34:30.160 --> 02:34:31.362
THAT HAVE CLOSED WITHIN A FIVE

02:34:31.428 --> 02:34:33.564
MILE RADIUS OF MY STORE, AND I'M

02:34:33.631 --> 02:34:35.099
NOW HAVING TO CHOOSE WHETHER OR

02:34:35.165 --> 02:34:36.967
NOT I CAN TAKE PARENTS,

02:34:37.034 --> 02:34:38.469
GRANDPARENTS OR CHILDREN BECAUSE

02:34:38.535 --> 02:34:40.170
I'M LOSING MONEY EVERY SINGLE

02:34:40.237 --> 02:34:41.672
TIME. IT'S VERY PAINFUL TO TURN

02:34:41.739 --> 02:34:43.273
THEM AWAY. WHILE MOST PEOPLE

02:34:43.340 --> 02:34:45.175
DON'T REALIZE WHY THEIR LOCAL

02:34:45.242 --> 02:34:47.645
PHARMACY CLOSES, I CAN TELL YOU

02:34:47.711 --> 02:34:48.812
FIRSTHAND IT IS THE UNCHECKED

02:34:48.879 --> 02:34:50.648
POWERS OF THE PBMS THAT IS

02:34:50.714 --> 02:34:52.049
DRIVING US OUT. AND IT'S NOT

02:34:52.116 --> 02:34:54.585
JUST IN SACRAMENTO, IT'S ACROSS

02:34:54.652 --> 02:34:56.353
CALIFORNIA. MY FRIENDS DOWN IN

02:34:56.420 --> 02:34:57.755
FRESNO HAVE OWNED PHARMACIES

02:34:57.821 --> 02:34:59.990
THAT HAVE HELPED COVID VACCINES

02:35:00.057 --> 02:35:01.425
AND DISTRIBUTED THEM. AND GUESS

02:35:01.492 --> 02:35:03.260
WHAT? THEY'RE NOW CLOSED. WE

02:35:03.327 --> 02:35:06.196
NEED REAL ACTION. WE NEED YOU TO

02:35:06.263 --> 02:35:09.400
SIGN AND SUPPORT SB 441 TO STOP

02:35:09.466 --> 02:35:11.502
THE PBMS FROM REIMBURSING BELOW

02:35:11.568 --> 02:35:12.970
COST AND DRIVING PHARMACIES LIKE

02:35:13.037 --> 02:35:14.938
MINE OUT OF BUSINESS. PHARMACIES

02:35:15.005 --> 02:35:16.540
ARE ESSENTIAL. OUR PATIENTS

02:35:16.607 --> 02:35:18.375
CANNOT CONTINUE TO SUFFER. OUR

02:35:18.442 --> 02:35:19.877
PHARMACIES CANNOT CONTINUE TO

02:35:19.943 --> 02:35:21.979
DISAPPEAR. AND I RESPECTFULLY

02:35:22.046 --> 02:35:23.347
ASK AND RESPECT YOUR SUPPORT.

02:35:23.414 --> 02:35:26.250

02:44:25.488 --> 02:44:27.991
BEING THAT HE WANTED GREATER

02:44:28.058 --> 02:44:29.826
TRANSPARENCY ACROSS THE DRUG

02:44:29.893 --> 02:44:33.129
SUPPLY CHAIN. THIS LEGISLATURE

02:44:33.196 --> 02:44:36.800
JUST LAST WEEK PASSED AB 116,

02:44:36.866 --> 02:44:38.935
THE HEALTH BUDGET TRAILER BILL,

02:44:39.002 --> 02:44:41.404
WHICH ACHIEVED MANY OF THOSE

02:44:41.471 --> 02:44:43.273
GOALS FOR THE GOVERNOR. PBMS

02:44:43.340 --> 02:44:44.975
WILL NOW BE LICENSED AND

02:44:45.041 --> 02:44:46.176
REGULATED AT THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:44:46.243 --> 02:44:48.511
MANAGED HEALTH CARE AND REQUIRED

02:44:48.578 --> 02:44:51.548
TO REPORT AN EXTENSIVE AMOUNT OF

02:44:51.615 --> 02:44:53.049
DATA TO THE OFFICE OF HEALTH

02:44:53.116 --> 02:44:54.951
CARE AFFORDABILITY, INCLUDING

02:44:55.018 --> 02:44:57.988
CLAIMS DATA, CONTRACT TERMS,

02:44:58.054 --> 02:44:59.356
REIMBURSEMENT RATES AT

02:44:59.422 --> 02:45:00.724
INDEPENDENT PHARMACIES VERSUS

02:45:00.790 --> 02:45:02.592
AFFILIATE PHARMACIES, AND A

02:45:02.659 --> 02:45:05.161
WHOLE LOT MORE. WITH THAT DATA,

02:45:05.228 --> 02:45:08.031
THIS LEGISLATURE WILL SOON BE

02:45:08.098 --> 02:45:10.600
INFORMED AND ABLE TO MAKE

02:45:10.667 --> 02:45:12.769
EDUCATED POLICY DECISIONS ABOUT

02:45:12.836 --> 02:45:16.039
HOW ELSE TO REGULATE THE DRUG

02:45:16.106 --> 02:45:18.174
SUPPLY CHAIN AND SPECIFICALLY

02:45:18.241 --> 02:45:22.812
PBMS, SB 41 GOES FAR IN THAT IT

02:45:22.879 --> 02:45:24.681
PROPOSES ADDITIONAL POLICY

02:45:24.748 --> 02:45:26.816
CHANGES THAT TAKE AWAY CLIENT

02:45:26.883 --> 02:45:29.653
CHOICE AND TIE THE HANDS OF PBMS

02:45:29.719 --> 02:45:31.154
IN THEIR NEGOTIATIONS AGAINST

02:45:31.221 --> 02:45:33.490
DRUG MANUFACTURERS. LEFT

02:45:33.556 --> 02:45:35.759
UNCHECKED, WE ARE TRUSTING THAT

02:45:35.825 --> 02:45:38.361
DRUG MANUFACTURERS WILL LOWER

02:45:38.428 --> 02:45:40.130
THE PRICE THE LIST PRICE THAT

02:45:40.196 --> 02:45:41.298
THEY SET OUT OF THE KINDNESS OF

02:45:41.364 --> 02:45:43.300
THEIR HEARTS. I DON'T THINK THAT

02:45:43.366 --> 02:45:45.402
THAT WORLD EXISTS, AND AS A

02:45:45.468 --> 02:45:46.970
RESULT, OUR CONCERN IS THAT THE

02:45:47.037 --> 02:45:49.205
PRICE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS WILL

02:45:49.272 --> 02:45:51.975
ONLY GO UP FOR CONSUMERS AND THE

02:45:52.042 --> 02:45:53.143
PATIENTS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO

02:45:53.209 --> 02:45:54.844
MAKE THEM MORE AFFORDABLE FOR.

02:45:54.911 --> 02:45:56.279
IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMIND THIS

02:45:56.346 --> 02:45:58.815
COMMITTEE THAT PBM CLIENTS DO

02:45:58.882 --> 02:46:01.685
NOT HAVE TO USE PBMS. PBM

02:46:01.751 --> 02:46:06.356
CLIENTS BEING UNIONS. THE STATE

02:46:06.423 --> 02:46:09.225
PLANS LARGE EMPLOYERS MAKE THE

02:46:09.292 --> 02:46:11.127
DECISION TO USE PBMS BECAUSE

02:46:11.194 --> 02:46:13.663
THEY SAVE THEM MONEY. NOTHING IN

02:46:13.730 --> 02:46:16.499
SB 41 WILL LOWER THE COST OF

02:46:16.566 --> 02:46:17.934
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR PATIENTS.

02:46:18.001 --> 02:46:19.803
AND WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE TIME

02:46:19.869 --> 02:46:21.805
AND WORK THAT THE CHAIR AND THIS

02:46:21.871 --> 02:46:23.640
COMMITTEE HAVE PUT INTO THIS

02:46:23.707 --> 02:46:27.277
BILL, IN THIS ISSUE, WE REMAIN

02:46:27.344 --> 02:46:28.712
OPPOSED OUT OF CONCERN THAT IT

02:46:28.778 --> 02:46:31.581
WILL ONLY INCREASE THE COST OF

02:46:31.648 --> 02:46:32.649
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. AND WE URGE

02:46:32.716 --> 02:46:36.186
A NO VOTE. THANK YOU. GO AHEAD.

02:46:36.252 --> 02:46:37.620
THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR. MEMBERS

02:46:37.687 --> 02:46:39.122
JOHN WINGER HERE ON BEHALF OF

02:46:39.189 --> 02:46:39.656
AMERICA'S HEALTH INSURANCE

02:46:39.723 --> 02:46:41.424
PLANS, WE'RE THE NATIONAL TRADE

02:46:41.491 --> 02:46:41.991
ASSOCIATION FOR THE HEALTH

02:46:42.058 --> 02:46:44.461
PLANS. AS PCMA STATED, OUR

02:46:44.527 --> 02:46:46.396
HEALTH PLANS VOLUNTARILY ENTER

02:46:46.463 --> 02:46:48.465
INTO ARRANGEMENTS WITH PBMS TO

02:46:48.531 --> 02:46:50.767
LOWER THEIR DRUG SPEND. BUT IN

02:46:50.834 --> 02:46:52.469
THE INTEREST OF TIME, THERE'S

02:46:52.535 --> 02:46:54.237
MULTIPLE PARTS OF THE BILL THAT

02:46:54.304 --> 02:46:55.839
WE THINK WOULD INCREASE COST.

02:46:55.905 --> 02:46:57.474
BUT IN THE INTEREST OF TIME,

02:46:57.540 --> 02:46:58.842
JUST FOCUS ON TWO THINGS THAT

02:46:58.908 --> 02:46:59.743
THE PLANS GENERALLY HAVE ISSUES

02:46:59.809 --> 02:47:01.010
WITH IN THE BILL. ONE IS AROUND

02:47:01.077 --> 02:47:02.879
ERISA PREEMPTION, AND THE SECOND

02:47:02.946 --> 02:47:05.115
IS AROUND CLIENT CHOICE. AND SO

02:47:05.181 --> 02:47:06.549
I THINK THERE'S MULTIPLE

02:47:06.616 --> 02:47:07.984
PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL THAT WE

02:47:08.051 --> 02:47:10.320
BELIEVE VIOLATE ERISA. THERE WAS

02:47:10.387 --> 02:47:13.390
A 2020 ERISA COURT CASE THAT WAS

02:47:13.456 --> 02:47:14.324
UPHELD UNANIMOUSLY BY THE

02:47:14.391 --> 02:47:15.992
SUPREME COURT THAT AFFIRMED LAWS

02:47:16.059 --> 02:47:18.027
OR PREEMPTED BY ERISA WHEN THEY

02:47:18.094 --> 02:47:19.829
IMPACT THE CORE FUNCTION OF

02:47:19.896 --> 02:47:21.664
HEALTH PLAN ADMINISTRATION OR

02:47:21.731 --> 02:47:22.966
DIRECTLY RELATE TO THE HEALTH

02:47:23.032 --> 02:47:24.534
PLAN AND THEIR BENEFIT DESIGN.

02:47:24.601 --> 02:47:25.869
AND WE THINK THERE'S MULTIPLE

02:47:25.935 --> 02:47:27.470
PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL THAT

02:47:27.537 --> 02:47:30.974
VIOLATE ERISA ON THE CLIENT

02:47:31.040 --> 02:47:32.876
CHOICE, AS AS WAS MENTIONED BY

02:47:32.942 --> 02:47:35.612
PCMA, WE THINK THAT THE PBMS

02:47:35.678 --> 02:47:38.114
OFFER AN ARRAY OF CHOICES TO THE

02:47:38.181 --> 02:47:40.250
CLIENT ON HOW THEY WANT TO PAY

02:47:40.316 --> 02:47:41.484
FOR THE SERVICES. SOME OF THOSE

02:47:41.551 --> 02:47:42.952
ARRANGEMENTS CAN BE DONE IN A

02:47:43.019 --> 02:47:45.722
WAY TO KIND OF MITIGATE RISK. ON

02:47:45.789 --> 02:47:46.523
THE PAYER SIDE, THIS BILL WOULD

02:47:46.589 --> 02:47:47.924
ESSENTIALLY GET RID OF THOSE

02:47:47.991 --> 02:47:49.993
OPTIONS. AND SO WE DO HAVE

02:47:50.059 --> 02:47:51.828
ISSUES WITH THAT AS WELL. AND SO

02:47:51.895 --> 02:47:52.529
FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE

02:47:52.595 --> 02:47:54.097
OPPOSED. THANK YOU. ANY OTHERS

02:47:54.164 --> 02:47:55.665
IN THE HEARING ROOM THAT WOULD

02:47:55.732 --> 02:48:00.503
LIKE TO OFFER AN OPPOSITION

02:48:00.570 --> 02:48:08.144
POSITION ON THE BILL? MADAM

02:48:08.211 --> 02:48:09.045
CHAIR AND MEMBERS, STEPHANIE

02:48:09.112 --> 02:48:10.213
WATKINS, ON BEHALF OF THE

02:48:10.280 --> 02:48:12.248
ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE

02:48:12.315 --> 02:48:13.516
AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES,

02:48:13.583 --> 02:48:16.352
ALSO OPPOSED. GOOD AFTERNOON,

02:48:16.419 --> 02:48:19.189
OLGA SHILOH, ON BEHALF OF THE

02:48:19.255 --> 02:48:19.823
CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH

02:48:19.889 --> 02:48:22.091
PLANS. ALSO OPPOSED. THANK YOU.

02:48:22.158 --> 02:48:23.993
THANK YOU. WITH THAT, SEEING NO

02:48:24.060 --> 02:48:25.428
OTHER OPPOSITION, I WILL BRING

02:48:25.495 --> 02:48:27.864
IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY

02:48:27.931 --> 02:48:31.701
COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. ASSEMBLY

02:48:31.768 --> 02:48:34.504
MEMBER SHARPE COLLINS, THANK YOU

02:48:34.571 --> 02:48:36.105
SO MUCH FOR BRINGING FORTH THE

02:48:36.172 --> 02:48:38.274
BILL. SENATOR, I DO HAVE A

02:48:38.341 --> 02:48:41.110
QUESTION OF CLARIFICATION TO THE

02:48:41.177 --> 02:48:42.679
OPPOSITION, AND I KNOW THE

02:48:42.745 --> 02:48:44.881
OPPOSITION. YOU STATED THAT THAT

02:48:44.948 --> 02:48:46.282
THE WAY THE BILL IS CURRENTLY

02:48:46.349 --> 02:48:47.383
WRITTEN, THAT IT WILL NOT LOWER

02:48:47.450 --> 02:48:49.853
THE PRICES OF THE PRESCRIPTIONS

02:48:49.919 --> 02:48:52.055
TO THE CONSUMERS. SO IF THAT IS

02:48:52.121 --> 02:48:53.690
THE CASE, THEN WHAT OTHER

02:48:53.756 --> 02:48:54.924
ALTERNATIVES DO WE HAVE? WHAT

02:48:54.991 --> 02:48:56.292
OPTIONS? SO WHAT ALL COULD WE

02:48:56.359 --> 02:48:58.828
ACTUALLY DO TO LOWER THE PRICES

02:48:58.895 --> 02:49:01.431
FOR THE CONSUMERS? WELL, I MEAN,

02:49:01.498 --> 02:49:03.666
I THINK ONE THING THAT WE TRY TO

02:49:03.733 --> 02:49:06.102
DO AS PBMS IS TO THE EXTENT THAT

02:49:06.169 --> 02:49:07.437
THERE ARE GENERICS AVAILABLE,

02:49:07.504 --> 02:49:09.272
THOSE ARE WHAT WE ARE

02:49:09.339 --> 02:49:11.140
ENCOURAGING AND HAVE PREFERRED

02:49:11.207 --> 02:49:13.309
PLACEMENT ON FORMULARIES. WHAT

02:49:13.376 --> 02:49:16.379
WE SEE HAPPEN OFTENTIMES IS DRUG

02:49:16.446 --> 02:49:18.648
MANUFACTURERS THAT ACTUALLY DO

02:49:18.715 --> 02:49:20.049
EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO PREVENT

02:49:20.116 --> 02:49:21.518
GENERICS FROM COMING TO MARKET,

02:49:21.584 --> 02:49:22.886
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT THAT

02:49:22.952 --> 02:49:24.053
COMPETITION. I DON'T KNOW THAT

02:49:24.120 --> 02:49:25.221
THAT'S NECESSARILY SOMETHING

02:49:25.288 --> 02:49:26.990
THAT THIS LEGISLATURE CAN

02:49:27.056 --> 02:49:29.792
TACKLE, BUT SOME OF PHARMA'S

02:49:29.859 --> 02:49:31.961
TACTICS TO REDUCE COMPETITION

02:49:32.028 --> 02:49:33.496
STAND DIRECTLY IN THE WAY OF THE

02:49:33.563 --> 02:49:37.000
ABILITY TO HAVE LOWER COST DRUGS

02:49:37.066 --> 02:49:42.805
AVAILABLE TO CONSUMERS. PLEASE.

02:49:42.872 --> 02:49:45.208
YEAH. I MEAN, CLEARLY THERE ARE

02:49:45.275 --> 02:49:46.743
ISSUES TO DEAL WITH WITH THE

02:49:46.809 --> 02:49:47.410
PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY. AND

02:49:47.477 --> 02:49:49.579
THIS LEGISLATURE HAS HAS DONE

02:49:49.646 --> 02:49:51.014
THAT. AND IT'S, YOU KNOW,

02:49:51.080 --> 02:49:52.782
THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE IN

02:49:52.849 --> 02:49:54.817
CONGRESS AS WELL. BUT WE KNOW

02:49:54.884 --> 02:49:56.753
THAT IN ADDITION TO WHATEVER

02:49:56.819 --> 02:50:00.023
ISSUES WITH WITH PHARMA, THAT

02:50:00.089 --> 02:50:02.258
PBMS ALSO ESCALATE DRUG COSTS,

02:50:02.325 --> 02:50:03.993
BECAUSE THE WAY THEY'RE ONE OF

02:50:04.060 --> 02:50:06.529
THE PRACTICES WE'RE BANNING IN

02:50:06.596 --> 02:50:07.030
THIS BILL, WHICH AGAIN,

02:50:07.096 --> 02:50:07.664
LICENSURE IS GREAT SUPPORTED.

02:50:07.730 --> 02:50:09.966
I'M GLAD IT WENT IN THE BUDGET

02:50:10.033 --> 02:50:11.701
THAT DOESN'T BAN ANY PARTICULAR

02:50:11.768 --> 02:50:15.071
PRACTICES. THE WAY THAT PBMS GET

02:50:15.138 --> 02:50:16.906
COMPENSATED VIA TAKING A CUT OF

02:50:16.973 --> 02:50:18.808
THE REBATES THAT THEY NEGOTIATE

02:50:18.875 --> 02:50:20.176
WITH THE DRUG MANUFACTURERS

02:50:20.243 --> 02:50:21.945
MEANS THE HIGHER THE DRUG COST,

02:50:22.011 --> 02:50:23.279
THE HIGHER THE REBATE, THE

02:50:23.346 --> 02:50:25.648
HIGHER THEIR TAKE. AND SO THAT'S

02:50:25.715 --> 02:50:27.350
WHY SOMETIMES ON DRUG

02:50:27.417 --> 02:50:28.785
FORMULARIES, FOR EXAMPLE, LOWER

02:50:28.851 --> 02:50:31.287
COST INSULIN OR SOMETIMES ONLY

02:50:31.354 --> 02:50:33.356
HIGHER COST INSULIN IS ON THE

02:50:33.423 --> 02:50:36.025
DRUG FORMULARY BECAUSE PBMS MAKE

02:50:36.092 --> 02:50:37.594
MORE MONEY FROM IT. SO, YOU

02:50:37.660 --> 02:50:41.064
KNOW, THERE ARE SO THEY ARE

02:50:41.130 --> 02:50:42.098
ABSOLUTELY CONTRIBUTING TO COST

02:50:42.165 --> 02:50:45.535
ESCALATIONS. I'M JUST NOTICING

02:50:45.602 --> 02:50:47.937
THAT. DID YOU WANT TO COMMENT

02:50:48.004 --> 02:50:48.938
BECAUSE YOU HAVE SOME

02:50:49.005 --> 02:50:51.541
DISAGREEMENT? YEAH, I WOULD JUST

02:50:51.608 --> 02:50:53.042
SAY WE FUNDAMENTALLY DISAGREE

02:50:53.109 --> 02:50:56.179
WITH THAT. PBMS GET HIRED TO

02:50:56.245 --> 02:50:58.081
NEGOTIATE THE LOWEST NET PRICE

02:50:58.147 --> 02:50:59.749
ON THE FORMULARY AS POSSIBLE,

02:50:59.816 --> 02:51:02.652
AND THOSE REBATES GO TOWARDS

02:51:02.719 --> 02:51:04.654
REDUCING THE OVERALL DRUG SPEND.

02:51:04.721 --> 02:51:07.190
AND IT'S BEEN SEEN IN THE SB 17

02:51:07.256 --> 02:51:08.558
REPORTS THAT IT HELPS TO LOWER

02:51:08.625 --> 02:51:11.227
AND KEEP PREMIUMS DOWN. SO WE

02:51:11.294 --> 02:51:12.829
WOULD JUST FUNDAMENTALLY

02:51:12.895 --> 02:51:14.130
DISAGREE WITH THAT. AND I THINK

02:51:14.197 --> 02:51:15.565
TO YOUR ORIGINAL POINT, WE WOULD

02:51:15.632 --> 02:51:17.767
JUST SAY STOP TAKING TOOLS AWAY

02:51:17.834 --> 02:51:19.702
TOOL CHEST. WHEN IT COMES TO

02:51:19.769 --> 02:51:20.737
BEING ABLE TO NEGOTIATE DRUG

02:51:20.803 --> 02:51:22.138
PRICES. I MEAN, I WAS AROUND FOR

02:51:22.205 --> 02:51:24.207
AB 339, THE GORDON BILL, WHICH

02:51:24.273 --> 02:51:26.476
WAS KIND OF CAPPING THE CO-PAY,

02:51:26.542 --> 02:51:27.977
BUT IT ALSO HAD PROVISIONS IN

02:51:28.044 --> 02:51:29.846
THERE THAT KIND OF MANDATED

02:51:29.912 --> 02:51:31.214
WHERE WE HAD TO PLACE DRUGS ON

02:51:31.280 --> 02:51:32.548
CERTAIN FORMULARIES, WHICH

02:51:32.615 --> 02:51:33.916
ESSENTIALLY GAVE OUR PLAYBOOK

02:51:33.983 --> 02:51:35.618
AWAY ON BEING ABLE TO NEGOTIATE.

02:51:35.685 --> 02:51:37.020
AND SO THINGS LIKE THAT HAVE

02:51:37.086 --> 02:51:38.454
MADE IT TOUGHER TO NEGOTIATE.

02:51:38.521 --> 02:51:40.089
THERE'S THINGS IN THIS BILL

02:51:40.156 --> 02:51:41.391
AROUND BANNING EXCLUSIONARY,

02:51:41.457 --> 02:51:43.126
EXCLUSIONARY CONTRACTS TO WHERE

02:51:43.192 --> 02:51:45.128
IT WOULD MAKE IT TOUGHER TO DO

02:51:45.194 --> 02:51:46.162
FORMULARY PLACEMENT, WHICH WOULD

02:51:46.229 --> 02:51:48.998
ALLOW US TO LOWER THE COST OF

02:51:49.065 --> 02:51:50.533
THE DRUG. AND SO I THINK JUST

02:51:50.600 --> 02:51:53.102
ALLOWING OUR TOOLS TO REMAIN IN

02:51:53.169 --> 02:51:55.672
THE TOOL CHEST WOULD BE OUR ASK.

02:51:55.738 --> 02:51:58.074
THANK YOU. I'LL ADD TO THAT THAT

02:51:58.141 --> 02:51:59.509
WHEN DRUGS GO GENERIC, PBMS

02:51:59.575 --> 02:52:00.910
OFTEN KEEP THE BRAND NAME ON

02:52:00.977 --> 02:52:02.779
THEIR FORMULARY FOR MONTHS AND

02:52:02.845 --> 02:52:04.113
YEARS AFTER THOSE DRUGS DO GO

02:52:04.180 --> 02:52:06.382
GENERIC. I HAVE EXAMPLES THAT I

02:52:06.449 --> 02:52:08.251
CAN PROVIDE YOU, SUCH AS

02:52:08.317 --> 02:52:09.419
VYVANSE. VYVANSE IS NOW GENERIC.

02:52:09.485 --> 02:52:11.354
THE GENERIC COST A FOURTH OF

02:52:11.421 --> 02:52:12.689
WHAT THE BRAND NAME COST, BUT

02:52:12.755 --> 02:52:14.223
THE BRAND NAME IS REQUIRED BY

02:52:14.290 --> 02:52:16.159
SOME PLANS. IT'S CALLED THE DOOR

02:52:16.225 --> 02:52:17.360
NINE PROGRAM. SO EVEN THOUGH THE

02:52:17.427 --> 02:52:19.028
GENERIC IS AVAILABLE AND IT'S

02:52:19.095 --> 02:52:20.530
CHEAP AND WE CAN GET IT, THE

02:52:20.596 --> 02:52:22.231
PLAN PREFERS THE BRAND AND THE

02:52:22.298 --> 02:52:23.599
PATIENT MAY HAVE A CO-PAY THAT'S

02:52:23.666 --> 02:52:25.435
HIGHER THAN WHAT THEY WOULD PAY

02:52:25.501 --> 02:52:26.302
OUT OF POCKET FOR THE GENERIC

02:52:26.369 --> 02:52:28.938
NOT ONLY VYVANSE, BUT THERE'S

02:52:29.005 --> 02:52:29.839
INHALERS. THERE'S NAME SOME

02:52:29.906 --> 02:52:31.874
OTHER EXAMPLES. INSULINS FOR

02:52:31.941 --> 02:52:34.077
SEGA CAME OUT GENERIC LAST YEAR.

02:52:34.143 --> 02:52:38.715
IT COST ABOUT $600, THE GENERICS

02:52:38.781 --> 02:52:41.017
$150. PATIENTS HAVE TO PAY,

02:52:41.084 --> 02:52:42.652
USUALLY THEIR $2,000 DEDUCTIBLE

02:52:42.719 --> 02:52:43.820
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR.

02:52:43.886 --> 02:52:46.823
THEY'RE PAYING THE MOST OF THAT

02:52:46.889 --> 02:52:47.824
COST 400 TO $600 FOR THIS

02:52:47.890 --> 02:52:48.458
PRESCRIPTION, EVEN THOUGH

02:52:48.524 --> 02:52:49.792
THERE'S A GENERIC AVAILABLE,

02:52:49.859 --> 02:52:51.027
BECAUSE THE INSURANCE PLAN

02:52:51.094 --> 02:52:53.029
REQUIRES THAT THE BRAND BE

02:52:53.096 --> 02:52:54.297
BILLED, WHICH IS NOT FAIR. SO

02:52:54.363 --> 02:52:56.399
WHEN WE TALK TO PATIENTS ABOUT A

02:52:56.466 --> 02:52:58.134
CASH PACE, CASH BASED PROGRAM

02:52:58.201 --> 02:53:00.503
FOR THEM SO THAT THEY CAN SAVE

02:53:00.570 --> 02:53:01.404
MONEY, WHICH MOST OF OUR

02:53:01.471 --> 02:53:02.505
PATIENTS WHO ARE OVER 65 WHO

02:53:02.572 --> 02:53:04.607
UTILIZE THIS BILL ARE LIVING ON

02:53:04.674 --> 02:53:07.143
LIMITED INCOMES. WE OFFER THE

02:53:07.210 --> 02:53:08.845
GENERIC OPTION FOR THEM AND ALSO

02:53:08.911 --> 02:53:11.314
LET THEM KNOW THAT IF WE DO RUN

02:53:11.380 --> 02:53:12.982
A CASH FOR THIS PRESCRIPTION,

02:53:13.049 --> 02:53:13.583
PARTICULARLY THE GENERIC, THAT

02:53:13.649 --> 02:53:15.785
IT WILL BE NOT APPLIED TO THE

02:53:15.852 --> 02:53:17.353
DEDUCTIBLE. AND THIS IS TO SAVE

02:53:17.420 --> 02:53:19.689
THEM MONEY AND. GO AHEAD.

02:53:19.756 --> 02:53:20.723
SENATOR. YEAH. THANK YOU

02:53:20.790 --> 02:53:22.492
MANAGER. AND I WILL JUST SAY

02:53:22.558 --> 02:53:23.626
WHEN I FIRST STARTED GETTING

02:53:23.693 --> 02:53:25.495
INVOLVED INVOLVED IN THIS AND

02:53:25.561 --> 02:53:27.363
THE AND THE HEALTH PLANS,

02:53:27.430 --> 02:53:28.931
ASSOCIATIONS ALL CAME OUT

02:53:28.998 --> 02:53:31.334
OPPOSED TO IT. I WAS REALLY

02:53:31.400 --> 02:53:32.602
CONFUSED AT FIRST BECAUSE IF

02:53:32.668 --> 02:53:35.571
YOU'RE A PAYER, THEN THESE

02:53:35.638 --> 02:53:37.607
PRACTICES ARE NOT IN YOUR

02:53:37.673 --> 02:53:39.542
INTEREST. I LEARNED OVER TIME

02:53:39.609 --> 02:53:43.379
THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE BASICALLY

02:53:43.446 --> 02:53:44.947
INTEGRATION BETWEEN HEALTH PLANS

02:53:45.014 --> 02:53:47.183
AND PBMS AND MUTUAL OWNERSHIP,

02:53:47.250 --> 02:53:50.253
OR ONE OWNS THE OTHER, IT'S IT

02:53:50.319 --> 02:53:52.121
THAT HELPED EXPLAIN IT. AND I'M

02:53:52.188 --> 02:53:53.389
GRATEFUL THAT, YOU KNOW, BLUE

02:53:53.456 --> 02:53:55.892
SHIELD, WHICH WAS NOT FORMALLY

02:53:55.958 --> 02:53:58.227
IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL LAST

02:53:58.294 --> 02:53:58.895
YEAR, BUT THIS YEAR IS FORMALLY

02:53:58.961 --> 02:54:01.497
IN SUPPORT, BECAUSE I THINK THAT

02:54:01.564 --> 02:54:04.000
SHOWS THAT IF YOU'RE A PAYER,

02:54:04.066 --> 02:54:05.535
THIS IS A BILL THAT, FRANKLY,

02:54:05.601 --> 02:54:08.304
SHOULD BE SUPPORTING AND THAT

02:54:08.371 --> 02:54:10.706
INTEGRATION, I THINK, DISTORTS

02:54:10.773 --> 02:54:14.777
THE WHOLE SYSTEM. ASSEMBLY

02:54:14.844 --> 02:54:17.480
MEMBER PATEL, SENATOR, I WANT TO

02:54:17.547 --> 02:54:19.115
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL

02:54:19.182 --> 02:54:21.217
FORWARD. IT DOES BRING TO LIGHT

02:54:21.284 --> 02:54:23.786
SOME VERY TRICKY SITUATIONS FOR

02:54:23.853 --> 02:54:24.954
PATIENTS AND PAYERS THAT HAVE

02:54:25.021 --> 02:54:26.455
BEEN OUT THERE. AND OUR SMALL

02:54:26.522 --> 02:54:28.457
BUSINESS OWNERS WHO ARE OUR OUR

02:54:28.524 --> 02:54:29.192
PHARMACIES, OUR LOCAL

02:54:29.258 --> 02:54:31.194
PHARMACIES. WE'VE BEEN TALKING

02:54:31.260 --> 02:54:33.129
ABOUT PBMS IN HEALTH COMMITTEE

02:54:33.196 --> 02:54:35.064
THIS YEAR QUITE A LOT, AND WE'VE

02:54:35.131 --> 02:54:37.466
MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS AS WELL.

02:54:37.533 --> 02:54:39.669
A QUESTION FOR BOTH YOUR SIDE AS

02:54:39.735 --> 02:54:41.637
WELL AS THE OPPOSITION, SUPPORT

02:54:41.704 --> 02:54:44.040
AND OPPOSITION. I AS A SCIENTIST

02:54:44.106 --> 02:54:46.475
I LOOK FOR DATA. SO WHAT IS THE

02:54:46.542 --> 02:54:48.644
SPECIFIC DATA OR LACK THEREOF,

02:54:48.711 --> 02:54:50.680
THAT HAS DRIVEN YOU TO YOUR

02:54:50.746 --> 02:54:52.315
POSITION ON THIS BILL? I THINK

02:54:52.381 --> 02:54:54.517
WE HAVE READ AS JUST CONSUMERS

02:54:54.584 --> 02:54:56.485
OF MEDIA IN GENERAL, ARTICLE

02:54:56.552 --> 02:54:59.422
AFTER ARTICLE IN MAINSTREAM AND

02:54:59.488 --> 02:55:01.324
SPECIFIC PRESS ABOUT THE

02:55:01.390 --> 02:55:02.625
CHALLENGES WITH PBMS AND HOW

02:55:02.692 --> 02:55:05.995
IT'S INCREASING THE COST OF

02:55:06.062 --> 02:55:07.029
PHARMACEUTICAL ACCESS TO

02:55:07.096 --> 02:55:08.865
PATIENTS. SOME OF THE ANECDOTES

02:55:08.931 --> 02:55:11.267
THAT YOU'VE SHARED ARE EVEN

02:55:11.334 --> 02:55:13.870
RELATABLE TO ME. I IF I GO

02:55:13.936 --> 02:55:17.006
THROUGH MY LOCAL PHARMACY, I CAN

02:55:17.073 --> 02:55:19.175
ONLY GET A 30 DAY SUPPLY IF I

02:55:19.242 --> 02:55:21.010
WANT MORE THAN THAT WITH PAYING

02:55:21.077 --> 02:55:22.511
THAT COPAY OVER AND OVER AND

02:55:22.578 --> 02:55:24.046
OVER AGAIN, I WANT TO TRY TO

02:55:24.113 --> 02:55:27.416
AVOID THAT. IF I GO THROUGH THE

02:55:27.483 --> 02:55:29.252
MAIL ORDER, THEN IT'S I CAN GET

02:55:29.318 --> 02:55:31.687
THE 90 DAY SUPPLY, BUT THE PRICE

02:55:31.754 --> 02:55:32.755
IS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT. SO

02:55:32.822 --> 02:55:34.090
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT GOES

02:55:34.156 --> 02:55:35.391
THROUGH THIS. YOU'VE CITED THAT

02:55:35.458 --> 02:55:36.859
EXAMPLE. I FEEL IT. AND TO

02:55:36.926 --> 02:55:39.729
SENATOR, I FEEL YOU AS WELL WITH

02:55:39.795 --> 02:55:41.163
THE COMMENT. I WAS CONFUSED WHY

02:55:41.230 --> 02:55:44.400
OUR HEALTH PLANS AREN'T ALSO IN

02:55:44.467 --> 02:55:46.202
SUPPORT OF YOUR BILL, AND THEN

02:55:46.269 --> 02:55:47.536
UNDERSTANDING THE

02:55:47.603 --> 02:55:49.472
INTERCONNECTIVITY OF THE

02:55:49.538 --> 02:55:50.473
RELATIONSHIPS. IT DEFINITELY

02:55:50.539 --> 02:55:52.575
HELPS SHED SOME LIGHT TO THAT,

02:55:52.642 --> 02:55:54.543
TO WHY THEY'RE OPPOSED. BUT WHAT

02:55:54.610 --> 02:55:56.279
IS THE DATA THAT YOU HAVE ON THE

02:55:56.345 --> 02:55:58.180
SUPPORT SIDE FOR THIS? I'M SURE

02:55:58.247 --> 02:55:59.982
IT'S VAST. YEAH, WE HAVE AND WE

02:56:00.049 --> 02:56:01.717
ARE HAPPY TO PROVIDE. THERE'S

02:56:01.784 --> 02:56:04.987
QUITE A FEW STUDIES ABOUT THE

02:56:05.054 --> 02:56:06.722
IMPACTS OF THE REBATES AND THE

02:56:06.789 --> 02:56:08.524
SPREAD PRICING AND JUST THE

02:56:08.591 --> 02:56:12.061
WHOLE MODEL. AND SO WE'RE HAPPY

02:56:12.128 --> 02:56:14.363
TO PROVIDE THAT TO YOU. AND YES,

02:56:14.430 --> 02:56:16.332
THERE HAVE BEEN MAJOR EXPOSÉS IN

02:56:16.399 --> 02:56:17.833
THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, IN THE

02:56:17.900 --> 02:56:19.402
NEW YORK TIMES AND OTHER

02:56:19.468 --> 02:56:21.504
PUBLICATIONS ABOUT PBM ABUSIVE

02:56:21.570 --> 02:56:22.872
PRACTICES. BUT THERE HAS ALSO

02:56:22.939 --> 02:56:24.340
BEEN A LOT OF ANALYSIS DONE,

02:56:24.407 --> 02:56:26.142
INCLUDING IN CONGRESS, WHERE

02:56:26.208 --> 02:56:27.910
THERE'S BEEN BIPARTISAN SUPPORT

02:56:27.977 --> 02:56:30.279
AND OVERSIGHT. SO WE'RE HAPPY TO

02:56:30.346 --> 02:56:32.114
PROVIDE THAT DATA. YEAH. THANK

02:56:32.181 --> 02:56:33.849
YOU. AND FOR THE OPPOSITION,

02:56:33.916 --> 02:56:36.452
WHAT DATA DO YOU LEAN ON TO BACK

02:56:36.519 --> 02:56:38.087
UP YOUR POSITION THAT IT WILL

02:56:38.154 --> 02:56:40.523
NOT HELP BRING DOWN THE COST OF

02:56:40.589 --> 02:56:42.325
PHARMACEUTICALS? WELL, I THINK

02:56:42.391 --> 02:56:43.993
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO IS A LOT

02:56:44.060 --> 02:56:46.062
OF THE DATA THAT'S GOING TO BE

02:56:46.128 --> 02:56:47.430
PROVIDED TO YOU ALL INTO THE

02:56:47.496 --> 02:56:48.631
OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE

02:56:48.698 --> 02:56:49.231
AFFORDABILITY. THERE'S BEEN A

02:56:49.298 --> 02:56:51.067
LOT OF FINGER POINTING OVER THE

02:56:51.133 --> 02:56:53.102
LAST DECADE HERE IN THIS

02:56:53.169 --> 02:56:55.638
LEGISLATURE BETWEEN PBMS, DRUG

02:56:55.705 --> 02:56:56.605
MANUFACTURERS, TO A LESSER

02:56:56.672 --> 02:56:58.174
EXTENT, THE INDEPENDENT

02:56:58.240 --> 02:56:59.175
PHARMACIES. AND WE THINK THAT

02:56:59.241 --> 02:57:01.744
THAT DATA WILL ANSWER THE

02:57:01.811 --> 02:57:03.612
QUESTION, ARE INDEPENDENT

02:57:03.679 --> 02:57:04.981
PHARMACIES BEING REIMBURSED LESS

02:57:05.047 --> 02:57:07.316
THAN THE AFFILIATE PHARMACIES?

02:57:07.383 --> 02:57:09.719
ARE THE REBATES TO BLAME?

02:57:09.785 --> 02:57:11.587
REBATES GET SO MUCH TIME AND

02:57:11.654 --> 02:57:14.757
ATTENTION, BUT REALLY THOSE

02:57:14.824 --> 02:57:16.659
SAVINGS THAT ARE NEGOTIATED ARE

02:57:16.726 --> 02:57:19.895
PASSED ON TO THE CLIENT. 95%

02:57:19.962 --> 02:57:22.531
PLUS. AND A LOT OF THE PBMS ARE

02:57:22.598 --> 02:57:24.433
MAKING THE DECISION PROACTIVELY

02:57:24.500 --> 02:57:27.370
TO PASS ON 100% NOW. SO LET'S

02:57:27.436 --> 02:57:29.205
SEE WHAT THE DATA SAYS AND THEN

02:57:29.271 --> 02:57:30.873
MAKE THESE POLICY DECISIONS

02:57:30.940 --> 02:57:32.441
RATHER THAN TAKING AWAY THE

02:57:32.508 --> 02:57:34.944
TOOLS PBMS HAVE AND LEAVING IT

02:57:35.011 --> 02:57:36.412
TO PHARMA TO SET THE PRICE.

02:57:36.479 --> 02:57:38.481
WELL, I CERTAINLY DO APPRECIATE

02:57:38.547 --> 02:57:40.383
THE ANTICIPATING GETTING THAT

02:57:40.449 --> 02:57:43.285
DATA WITH THIS BUDGET TRAILER

02:57:43.352 --> 02:57:45.121
BILL THAT WE HAVE. WHEN DO WE

02:57:45.187 --> 02:57:46.088
ANTICIPATE GETTING THE FIRST

02:57:46.155 --> 02:57:49.058
BATCH OF DATA? I THINK IT'S 2027

02:57:49.125 --> 02:57:50.860
THAT THE FIRST BATCH WILL BE

02:57:50.926 --> 02:57:52.895
REPORTED AND IT HAS A LOOKBACK

02:57:52.962 --> 02:57:54.196
PERIOD. SO WE'LL BE ACTUALLY

02:57:54.263 --> 02:57:56.098
IT'S 2026. LET ME CORRECT

02:57:56.165 --> 02:57:58.100
MYSELF. IT IS 2026, BUT THERE'S

02:57:58.167 --> 02:58:00.369
A LOOK BACK ON THE DATA THAT'S

02:58:00.436 --> 02:58:01.404
GOING TO BE REPORTED. SO YOU CAN

02:58:01.470 --> 02:58:04.140
TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IT WAS AND

02:58:04.206 --> 02:58:05.241
WHERE IT'S GOING AND BETTER

02:58:05.307 --> 02:58:08.411
UNDERSTAND I THINK IT IS AN

02:58:08.477 --> 02:58:10.212
OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO AGAIN,

02:58:10.279 --> 02:58:13.449
MAKE SOUND POLICY DECISIONS THAT

02:58:13.516 --> 02:58:15.618
ARE ROOTED IN DATA, RATHER THAN

02:58:15.684 --> 02:58:18.220
JUST ASSUMING THAT THESE POLICY

02:58:18.287 --> 02:58:19.855
PROPOSED IN THIS BILL IS GOING

02:58:19.922 --> 02:58:21.257
TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. THANK YOU.

02:58:21.323 --> 02:58:23.059
AND TO THE SENATOR, AS A FOLLOW

02:58:23.125 --> 02:58:25.594
UP QUESTION, DATA IS WONDERFUL,

02:58:25.661 --> 02:58:27.263
AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT

02:58:27.329 --> 02:58:29.331
IN A COUPLE OF YEARS. BUT

02:58:29.398 --> 02:58:30.066
LOOKING AT YOUR BILL, THERE'S

02:58:30.132 --> 02:58:32.935
NOTHING THAT THAT PROHIBITS THE

02:58:33.002 --> 02:58:34.703
DATA COLLECTION HAPPENING. AND

02:58:34.770 --> 02:58:37.473
IN THE MEANTIME. WE CAN STILL

02:58:37.540 --> 02:58:39.909
MOVE FORWARD. YEAH. AND JUST TO

02:58:39.975 --> 02:58:41.844
BE CLEAR, LIKE THIS IS WHEN WE

02:58:41.911 --> 02:58:43.512
PUT THIS BILL TOGETHER, THIS IS

02:58:43.579 --> 02:58:45.181
NOT LIKE WE HAVE THIS NEW NOVEL

02:58:45.247 --> 02:58:46.949
IDEA ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS PBMS.

02:58:47.016 --> 02:58:48.751
THESE ARE POLICIES THAT HAVE

02:58:48.818 --> 02:58:50.986
BEEN PERCOLATING IN CONGRESS, IN

02:58:51.053 --> 02:58:53.789
STATE LEGISLATURES, RED AND BLUE

02:58:53.856 --> 02:58:56.392
AROUND THE COUNTRY. AND, YOU

02:58:56.459 --> 02:58:59.161
KNOW, WHEN, WHEN THE WHEN THE

02:58:59.228 --> 02:59:00.663
GOVERNOR'S STAFF APPROACHED US

02:59:00.729 --> 02:59:02.565
AND SAID AND ASKED WHAT WE

02:59:02.631 --> 02:59:04.166
THOUGHT ABOUT PUTTING LICENSURE

02:59:04.233 --> 02:59:05.968
IN THE BUDGET, I THOUGHT IT WAS

02:59:06.035 --> 02:59:07.736
A GOOD IDEA. AND I THINK THE

02:59:07.803 --> 02:59:08.904
RATIONALE IS, LET'S GET THAT

02:59:08.971 --> 02:59:10.773
STAND STOOD UP QUICKLY, AS

02:59:10.840 --> 02:59:12.141
OPPOSED TO WAITING UNTIL NEXT

02:59:12.208 --> 02:59:14.310
YEAR'S BUDGET TO STAND IT UP.

02:59:14.376 --> 02:59:16.312
AND I KNEW THAT THE OPPOSITION

02:59:16.378 --> 02:59:16.946
WOULD IMMEDIATELY SAY, OH, WE

02:59:17.012 --> 02:59:18.347
GOT LICENSURE. WE DON'T NEED

02:59:18.414 --> 02:59:20.116
ANYTHING ELSE. AND AS IMPORTANT

02:59:20.182 --> 02:59:22.952
AS LICENSURE IS AND THE DATA, WE

02:59:23.018 --> 02:59:24.286
KNOW WHAT PRACTICES ARE

02:59:24.353 --> 02:59:26.922
HAPPENING. AND SO I AGREE WE

02:59:26.989 --> 02:59:28.324
SHOULD WE SHOULD ADDRESS THOSE

02:59:28.390 --> 02:59:30.626
PRACTICES NOW BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:59:30.693 --> 02:59:33.095
HAVING NEGATIVE IMPACTS NOW.

02:59:33.162 --> 02:59:36.866
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU

02:59:36.932 --> 02:59:39.101
I JUST WANTED TO PICK UP

02:59:39.168 --> 02:59:42.838
ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATEL ON ON YOUR

02:59:42.905 --> 02:59:45.441
QUERY AROUND DATA AND EVIDENCE

02:59:45.508 --> 02:59:48.577
TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT. SO I JUST

02:59:48.644 --> 02:59:49.211
WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF

02:59:49.278 --> 02:59:50.679
THINGS THAT THE SENATOR

02:59:50.746 --> 02:59:52.481
HIGHLIGHTED. ONE IS THAT THERE

02:59:52.548 --> 02:59:55.584
ARE THREE MAJOR PBM PROVIDERS.

02:59:55.651 --> 03:00:00.422
TWO OF THOSE OPTUM IS HAS A

03:00:00.489 --> 03:00:02.458
PARENT COMPANY OF

03:00:02.525 --> 03:00:04.393
UNITEDHEALTHCARE, UNITEDHEALTH

03:00:04.460 --> 03:00:05.461
GROUP, WHICH IS A PART OF THE

03:00:05.528 --> 03:00:06.829
INSURANCE COMPANY

03:00:06.896 --> 03:00:08.898
UNITEDHEALTHCARE. AND EXPRESS

03:00:08.964 --> 03:00:11.300
SCRIPTS IS OWNED BY CIGNA.

03:00:11.367 --> 03:00:13.736
BETWEEN THOSE TWO, I THINK THEY

03:00:13.802 --> 03:00:19.074
OWN WITH CVS CAREMARK MORE THAN

03:00:19.141 --> 03:00:21.310
50% OR 60%, 80%, 80% OF THE

03:00:21.377 --> 03:00:24.547
MARKET. AND I JUST HAD THE

03:00:24.613 --> 03:00:26.015
PLEASURE OF TALKING TO SOMEBODY

03:00:26.081 --> 03:00:27.850
TODAY, A STAKEHOLDER ABOUT THIS

03:00:27.917 --> 03:00:30.319
BILL WHO SHARED WITH ME THAT

03:00:30.386 --> 03:00:32.788
THEY WERE WORKING ON PBM REFORM

03:00:32.855 --> 03:00:36.625
FROM 1989. SO WE HAVE BEEN

03:00:36.692 --> 03:00:38.894
TRYING TO DESPERATELY DO

03:00:38.961 --> 03:00:40.296
SOMETHING IN THIS AREA IN THE

03:00:40.362 --> 03:00:42.731
STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR QUITE A

03:00:42.798 --> 03:00:46.835
WHILE, IN JUST A RECENT. OTHER

03:00:46.902 --> 03:00:48.437
METRICS I WOULD OFFER IS THAT IN

03:00:48.504 --> 03:00:54.810
THE US, THE PBM INDUSTRY IN 2022

03:00:54.877 --> 03:00:59.882
ALONE WAS A $482.4 BILLION

03:00:59.949 --> 03:01:05.354
INDUSTRY. IN 2024, $573.27

03:01:05.421 --> 03:01:08.090
BILLION INDUSTRY. IN THE

03:01:08.157 --> 03:01:09.491
MEANTIME, THE COST OF

03:01:09.558 --> 03:01:11.060
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS CONTINUE TO

03:01:11.126 --> 03:01:12.695
IMPACT AFFORDABILITY OF

03:01:12.761 --> 03:01:14.997
HEALTHCARE, WITH PLANS PAYING

03:01:15.064 --> 03:01:17.566
ABOUT $13.6 BILLION FOR

03:01:17.633 --> 03:01:19.602
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IN 2023

03:01:19.668 --> 03:01:22.037
ALONE. AND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS

03:01:22.104 --> 03:01:25.741
COSTS HAVE INCREASED BY 10.8% IN

03:01:25.808 --> 03:01:30.045
2023, WHICH IS THE TOTAL MEDIAN.

03:01:30.112 --> 03:01:31.847
MEDICAL EXPENSES HAVE ONLY

03:01:31.914 --> 03:01:34.416
INCREASED BY 4%, WHICH IS STILL

03:01:34.483 --> 03:01:37.586
ASTRONOMICAL. PREMIUMS BY 6.2%

03:01:37.653 --> 03:01:39.622
DURING THAT SAME TIME PERIOD. SO

03:01:39.688 --> 03:01:42.992
THERE'S BEEN JUST AN

03:01:43.058 --> 03:01:44.126
ASTRONOMICAL INCREASE IN THE

03:01:44.193 --> 03:01:47.463
COST OF DRUGS OVER TIME, AS WELL

03:01:47.529 --> 03:01:50.299
AS THE FACT THAT DURING A TEN

03:01:50.366 --> 03:01:55.204
YEAR PERIOD, 29, NEARLY 30% OF

03:01:55.271 --> 03:01:56.605
PHARMACIES, INDEPENDENT

03:01:56.672 --> 03:01:59.208
PHARMACIES HAVE CLOSED. SO WE

03:01:59.275 --> 03:02:03.078
HAVE A LOT OF INDICATORS OF

03:02:03.145 --> 03:02:04.613
RISING COST OF HEALTH CARE,

03:02:04.680 --> 03:02:07.449
RISING COST OF DRUGS, INCIDENTS

03:02:07.516 --> 03:02:12.154
OF INCREASED MARKET SHARE AND

03:02:12.221 --> 03:02:15.391
VERTICAL INTEGRATION OF PBMS

03:02:15.457 --> 03:02:17.593
WITH HEALTH, WITH, WITH

03:02:17.660 --> 03:02:19.962
INSURANCE PROVIDERS. CERTAINLY A

03:02:20.029 --> 03:02:22.598
LOT OF MONEY BEING MADE AND A

03:02:22.665 --> 03:02:25.434
LOT OF MONEY BEING TAKEN OUT OF

03:02:25.501 --> 03:02:27.036
CONSUMERS AND PATIENTS POCKETS

03:02:27.102 --> 03:02:29.104
DURING THAT TIME PERIOD. SO,

03:02:29.171 --> 03:02:31.607
SENATOR, I'M VERY THANKFUL TO

03:02:31.674 --> 03:02:34.443

FORWARD WITH WHAT I AND I'M SURE

OUR CONSULTANT HERE, SCOTT

03:02:39.748 --> 03:02:43.786
BANES, WOULD CALL A KITCHEN SINK

03:02:43.852 --> 03:02:45.254
OF A BILL RELATED TO PBM REFORM,

03:02:45.321 --> 03:02:47.523
NOT ONLY AROUND THE NEED FOR

03:02:47.589 --> 03:02:49.358
GREATER TRANSPARENCY, WHICH I AM

03:02:49.425 --> 03:02:51.026
THANKFUL WE HAVE AN ABILITY TO

03:02:51.093 --> 03:02:52.661
DO THAT AND GET THE ADDITIONAL

03:02:52.728 --> 03:02:54.396
DATA THAT WE NEED, BUT ALSO TO

03:02:54.463 --> 03:02:56.565
BE ABLE TO PROVIDE AN

03:02:56.632 --> 03:02:58.534
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE MANY

03:02:58.600 --> 03:03:00.336
DIFFERENT REFORMS AROUND

03:03:00.402 --> 03:03:04.106
PRACTICE THAT HAVE CAUSED MUCH

03:03:04.173 --> 03:03:07.576
OF THIS INCREASE IN DRUG COSTS.

03:03:07.643 --> 03:03:12.181
AND. NEAR ELIMINATION OF A VERY

03:03:12.247 --> 03:03:14.083
VITAL COMPONENT OF OUR

03:03:14.149 --> 03:03:15.984
HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY AS WELL. IN

03:03:16.051 --> 03:03:19.154
IN THE PHARMACIES. I DON'T SEE

03:03:19.221 --> 03:03:21.023
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. I KNOW THAT

03:03:21.090 --> 03:03:23.959
THERE WERE A LOT OF AMENDMENTS Þ

QUESTION. I KNOW THAT THERE WERE

03:03:27.996 --> 03:03:29.898
A LOT OF AMENDMENTS THAT WE WERE

03:03:29.965 --> 03:03:32.368
ABLE TO TAKE, AND I THANK YOU

TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT WE HAD

03:03:35.270 --> 03:03:37.773
A VERY TIGHT BILL, EVEN THOUGH

03:03:37.840 --> 03:03:38.707
IT WAS A KITCHEN SINK. AND WITH

03:03:38.774 --> 03:03:41.076
THAT, I WILL HAVE ASSEMBLYMEMBER

AGAIN, TAKING ON ANOTHER EASY

03:03:51.253 --> 03:03:53.021
ISSUE BEFORE OUR COMMITTEES. I

03:03:53.088 --> 03:03:54.590
JUST WANTED TO FOLLOW UP BECAUSE

03:03:54.656 --> 03:03:56.325
I KNOW PBMS, AS WE HEARD FROM

03:03:56.392 --> 03:03:58.660
OUR CHAIR, IS SUCH A COMPLICATED

03:03:58.727 --> 03:04:00.562
ISSUE. WE'RE GOING OVER A LOT OF

03:04:00.629 --> 03:04:02.765
TERMINOLOGY. YOU KNOW, THAT MANY

03:04:02.831 --> 03:04:04.500
OF US ARE STILL REALLY DIGGING

03:04:04.566 --> 03:04:06.001
DEEP ON IF YOU'RE WATCHING. I

03:04:06.068 --> 03:04:07.703
HAVE A LOT OF ALSO LOCAL

03:04:07.770 --> 03:04:08.904
PHARMACIES IN MY DISTRICT THAT

03:04:08.971 --> 03:04:11.940
HAVE REACHED OUT ABOUT THIS BILL

03:04:12.007 --> 03:04:14.176
AND JUST WANTED TO GET MAYBE A

03:04:14.243 --> 03:04:16.178
LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION FOR

03:04:16.245 --> 03:04:18.614
FOLKS LISTENING TO EXPLAIN SOME

03:04:18.680 --> 03:04:21.016
OF THE NUANCES OF SOME OF THE

03:04:21.083 --> 03:04:22.384
TERMS THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED.

03:04:22.451 --> 03:04:25.154
CAN YOU JUST SHARE WHAT SPREAD

03:04:25.220 --> 03:04:26.789
PRICING IS? I KNOW THAT'S ONE OF

03:04:26.855 --> 03:04:28.991
THE THINGS THAT ONE OF THE

03:04:29.057 --> 03:04:30.626
THINGS THAT YOUR BILL LOOKS TO,

03:04:30.692 --> 03:04:31.794
TO REGULATE. YEAH. SO SPREAD

03:04:31.860 --> 03:04:34.696
PRICING IS BASICALLY THAT THE

03:04:34.763 --> 03:04:36.865
PBM RECEIVES PAYMENT FOR A

03:04:36.932 --> 03:04:38.267
PARTICULAR PRESCRIPTION,

03:04:38.333 --> 03:04:40.202
RECEIVES PAYMENT FROM THE HEALTH

03:04:40.269 --> 03:04:43.439
PLAN, AND THEN PAYS AN AMOUNT TO

03:04:43.505 --> 03:04:46.708
THE PHARMACY PHARMACY. AND THERE

03:04:46.775 --> 03:04:48.444
IS A SPREAD BETWEEN THE TWO. SO

03:04:48.510 --> 03:04:49.778
THEY RECEIVE MORE FROM THE

03:04:49.845 --> 03:04:53.081
HEALTH PLAN THAN THEY PAY TO THE

03:04:53.148 --> 03:04:56.685
PHARMACY. AND THAT IS THE

03:04:56.752 --> 03:04:58.554
VARIOUS. THERE ARE VARIOUS KINDS

03:04:58.620 --> 03:04:59.488
OF COMPENSATION THAT PBMS

03:04:59.555 --> 03:05:01.990
RECEIVE WHICH RESULT IN THEM

03:05:02.057 --> 03:05:05.027
POCKETING A PORTION OF A

03:05:05.093 --> 03:05:06.462
PAYMENT, WHETHER WHETHER IT'S

03:05:06.528 --> 03:05:10.699
THAT OR VIA A REBATE. AND THAT

03:05:10.766 --> 03:05:14.670
HELPS DRIVE UP COSTS. AND

03:05:14.736 --> 03:05:15.704
PHARMACISTS DON'T GET THE FULL

03:05:15.771 --> 03:05:18.941
PAYMENT. THANK YOU, SENATOR, AND

03:05:19.007 --> 03:05:20.609
FOR THE OPPOSITION, MAYBE IF YOU

03:05:20.676 --> 03:05:22.978
CAN HELP CLARIFY, ONE OF OUR

03:05:23.045 --> 03:05:25.113
LOCAL PHARMACISTS MENTIONED THAT

03:05:25.180 --> 03:05:26.949
THEY DON'T GET FULLY REIMBURSED

03:05:27.015 --> 03:05:29.351
FOR SOME OF THE COSTS OF THE

03:05:29.418 --> 03:05:30.819
DRUGS THAT THEY ARE PAYING OUT

03:05:30.886 --> 03:05:33.288
FRONT AND ARE LEFT HAVING TO

03:05:33.355 --> 03:05:35.290
FOOT THE BILL FOR THE REST OF

03:05:35.357 --> 03:05:36.158
THE COST. CAN YOU ADDRESS SOME

03:05:36.225 --> 03:05:38.827
OF THOSE CONCERNS? SURE. SO

03:05:38.894 --> 03:05:40.062
QUICKLY, ON THE SPREAD PRICING,

03:05:40.128 --> 03:05:42.030
I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT

03:05:42.097 --> 03:05:43.532
THAT IS NOT REQUIRED. IT'S AN

03:05:43.599 --> 03:05:44.500
OPTION TO CLIENTS. THEY CAN

03:05:44.566 --> 03:05:46.335
CHOOSE SPREAD PRICING OR THEY

03:05:46.401 --> 03:05:48.337
CAN CHOOSE PASS THROUGH. SOME

03:05:48.403 --> 03:05:49.972
CHOOSE SPREAD PRICING BECAUSE IT

03:05:50.038 --> 03:05:51.073
PROVIDES THEM WITH MORE

03:05:51.139 --> 03:05:52.875
CERTAINTY ON WHAT THEY'RE GOING

03:05:52.941 --> 03:05:54.042
TO PAY, AND THEY WANT THAT. SO I

03:05:54.109 --> 03:05:56.144
JUST WANTED TO PUT THAT OUT

03:05:56.211 --> 03:05:57.779
THERE. TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT

03:05:57.846 --> 03:05:58.614
THE PHARMACISTS BEING REIMBURSED

03:05:58.680 --> 03:06:00.382
LESS THAN WHAT THEY MIGHT HAVE

03:06:00.449 --> 03:06:02.484
BEEN PAID FOR, THAT WE DON'T

03:06:02.551 --> 03:06:04.653
HAVE A COMPLETE PICTURE BECAUSE

03:06:04.720 --> 03:06:06.822
THEIR ACQUISITION COST IS IN A

03:06:06.889 --> 03:06:09.124
CONTRACT BETWEEN THE WHOLESALER

03:06:09.191 --> 03:06:12.194
OR CHAU. AND SO WE CAN'T ON OUR

03:06:12.261 --> 03:06:14.062
OWN, KNOW FOR CERTAIN AND

03:06:14.129 --> 03:06:15.531
REIMBURSE THEM AT A RATE THAT

03:06:15.597 --> 03:06:16.932
FULLY CAPTURES THAT. UNLESS WE

03:06:16.999 --> 03:06:19.835
HAVE THAT INFORMATION. ALSO,

03:06:19.902 --> 03:06:21.270
UNFORTUNATELY, YOU KNOW, THE

03:06:21.336 --> 03:06:22.437
BIGGEST PROVISION OF THIS BILL

03:06:22.504 --> 03:06:24.540
THAT I THINK DIRECTLY HELPED THE

03:06:24.606 --> 03:06:26.275
PHARMACISTS WERE WAS TAKEN OUT

03:06:26.341 --> 03:06:28.110
BECAUSE OF THE COST IMPLICATIONS

03:06:28.176 --> 03:06:30.612
OF THAT. AND THEN WHAT I'LL SAY

03:06:30.679 --> 03:06:32.648
IS, YOU KNOW, IT'S A CONTRACT BY

03:06:32.714 --> 03:06:33.949
CONTRACT BASIS. AND SO, YOU

03:06:34.016 --> 03:06:35.684
KNOW, THERE MAY BE SITUATIONS IN

03:06:35.751 --> 03:06:38.153
WHICH THE PHARMACY IS NOT BEING

03:06:38.220 --> 03:06:39.621
REIMBURSED OR MADE WHOLE, BUT

03:06:39.688 --> 03:06:41.790
THE INDEPENDENT PHARMACIES ARE A

03:06:41.857 --> 03:06:44.326
HUGE AND VITAL PART OF THE

03:06:44.393 --> 03:06:46.828
PHARMACY NETWORK. AND SO PBMS

03:06:46.895 --> 03:06:49.698
OFTENTIMES AND WE'LL SEE THIS IN

03:06:49.765 --> 03:06:50.532
THE DATA. THEY'RE REIMBURSING

03:06:50.599 --> 03:06:51.466
SOME INDEPENDENT PHARMACIES FAR

03:06:51.533 --> 03:06:53.302
MORE THAN THEY'RE REIMBURSING

03:06:53.368 --> 03:06:54.703
AFFILIATE PHARMACIES BECAUSE

03:06:54.770 --> 03:06:56.171
THEY NEED THEM IN THEIR NETWORK.

03:06:56.238 --> 03:06:58.240
THEY HAVE NETWORK ADEQUACY

03:06:58.307 --> 03:07:00.375
REQUIREMENTS. AND SO I

03:07:00.442 --> 03:07:01.910
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE

03:07:01.977 --> 03:07:03.579
PROBABLY IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE

03:07:03.645 --> 03:07:04.413
ARE SITUATIONS IN WHICH THEY ARE

03:07:04.479 --> 03:07:05.847
NOT GETTING REIMBURSED AND MADE

03:07:05.914 --> 03:07:07.916
WHOLE. AND THAT'S CERTAINLY A

03:07:07.983 --> 03:07:10.819
CONVERSATION WORTH HAVING. BUT

03:07:10.886 --> 03:07:13.422
THIS THIS BILL GOES FAR BEYOND

03:07:13.488 --> 03:07:16.692
THAT AND DOESN'T ACTUALLY HELP

03:07:16.758 --> 03:07:18.193
THE PHARMACISTS, I THINK, IN THE

03:07:18.260 --> 03:07:19.661
WAY THAT WOULD BE MOST

03:07:19.728 --> 03:07:21.797
MEANINGFUL FOR THEM. THANKS FOR

03:07:21.863 --> 03:07:23.065
SHARING THAT. AS A PBM, DO YOU

03:07:23.131 --> 03:07:25.167
HAVE ACCESS TO THESE

03:07:25.233 --> 03:07:27.803
TRANSACTIONS LIKE THAT DATA,

03:07:27.869 --> 03:07:29.404
WHICH, I MEAN, THE PBM WOULD

03:07:29.471 --> 03:07:32.541
KNOW WHAT THEY'RE PAYING THE

03:07:32.608 --> 03:07:34.376
PHARMACY, BUT THEY WOULDN'T KNOW

03:07:34.443 --> 03:07:37.145
WHAT THE PHARMACY IS PAYING THE

03:07:37.212 --> 03:07:38.747
WHOLESALER FOR THE ACQUISITION

03:07:38.814 --> 03:07:42.684
OF THAT DRUG. OKAY. I SEE SOME

03:07:42.751 --> 03:07:45.020
HEAD NODS. DID YOU WANT TO

03:07:45.087 --> 03:07:46.154
RESPOND? I WAS JUST GOING TO

03:07:46.221 --> 03:07:48.223
SAY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR

03:07:48.290 --> 03:07:50.292
A BILL OR TILL 2027 TO COME AND

03:07:50.359 --> 03:07:52.294
GET DATA FROM ME. YOU CAN BRING

03:07:52.361 --> 03:07:53.528
A THUMB DRIVE BY THE PHARMACY

03:07:53.595 --> 03:07:56.264
LATER TODAY, AND I WILL HAPPILY

03:07:56.331 --> 03:07:56.999
PROVIDE YOU WITH ALL OF THE

03:07:57.065 --> 03:07:58.367
FINANCIAL DATA RELATED TO THE

03:07:58.433 --> 03:07:59.034
PRESCRIPTIONS AT MY PHARMACY TO

03:07:59.101 --> 03:08:00.936
SHOW YOU THAT I AM NOT BEING

03:08:01.003 --> 03:08:02.404
PAID MORE THAN THE CHAIN

03:08:02.471 --> 03:08:03.972
PHARMACY UP THE STREET. BUT YOU

03:08:04.039 --> 03:08:05.641
CANNOT GO INTO THAT PHARMACY AND

03:08:05.707 --> 03:08:06.742
GET ANY DATA BECAUSE THEY WON'T

03:08:06.808 --> 03:08:08.877
PROVIDE IT TO YOU. BUT I'LL BE

03:08:08.944 --> 03:08:09.845
MORE THAN HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU

03:08:09.911 --> 03:08:11.647
WITH ANY DATA YOU WOULD LIKE. I

03:08:11.713 --> 03:08:13.548
MAY HAVE ALREADY PROVIDED IT TO

03:08:13.615 --> 03:08:14.983
THE STATE, AND I WOULD LIKE TO

03:08:15.050 --> 03:08:17.419
SECOND THAT I. IT SURPRISES ME

03:08:17.486 --> 03:08:18.020
BECAUSE OUR CONTRACTS THAT WE

03:08:18.086 --> 03:08:18.987
HAVE ARE NON-NEGOTIABLE

03:08:19.054 --> 03:08:20.188
CONTRACTS, SO WE EITHER TAKE IT

03:08:20.255 --> 03:08:20.922
OR LEAVE IT CONTRACTS, WHICH

03:08:20.989 --> 03:08:22.724
DOESN'T ALLOW US MUCH ROOM TO

03:08:22.791 --> 03:08:24.059
NEGOTIATE. AND WHEN WE DO

03:08:24.126 --> 03:08:27.663
NEGOTIATE, IT'S LIKE 0.001%

03:08:27.729 --> 03:08:29.164
CHANGES IN THE AWP PRICING THAT

03:08:29.231 --> 03:08:30.999
WE GET OR THE MAC PRICING THAT

03:08:31.066 --> 03:08:33.402
WE GET, WHICH IS, YOU KNOW, VERY

03:08:33.468 --> 03:08:35.270
FOREIGN. I MEAN, WE TALK ABOUT

03:08:35.337 --> 03:08:37.539
ACRONYMS. SO WE EITHER WE TAKE

03:08:37.606 --> 03:08:39.174
THOSE CONTRACTS OR WE DON'T. IF

03:08:39.241 --> 03:08:40.208
WE DON'T TAKE THOSE CONTRACTS,

03:08:40.275 --> 03:08:41.943
THEN WE DON'T GET PATIENTS. IF

03:08:42.010 --> 03:08:43.679
WE DON'T GET PATIENTS, WE CAN'T

03:08:43.745 --> 03:08:47.082
STAY OPEN. SO I'M I'LL SHARE

03:08:47.149 --> 03:08:48.717
WITH YOU ALL THAT. I MEAN,

03:08:48.784 --> 03:08:52.521
THAT'S EASY BREEZY STUFF. THANK

03:08:52.587 --> 03:08:53.889
YOU ALL FOR SHARING YOUR ANSWERS

03:08:53.955 --> 03:08:55.691

03:08:55.757 --> 03:08:57.159
ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU

03:08:57.225 --> 03:08:59.294

03:09:01.930 --> 03:09:04.833
END USER, THE PATIENT, AND WHAT

03:09:04.900 --> 03:09:06.868
THE COSTS ARE THAT WE'RE PASSING

03:09:06.935 --> 03:09:08.970
ON TO EVERY PATIENT TO ENSURE

03:09:09.037 --> 03:09:11.306
THAT WE IMPROVE THE COST OF

03:09:11.373 --> 03:09:13.809
HEALTH CARE IN THIS COUNTRY. AND

03:09:13.875 --> 03:09:14.843
SO APPRECIATE THE ADDITIONAL

03:09:14.910 --> 03:09:18.113
DETAIL. THANK YOU. I DON'T SEE
