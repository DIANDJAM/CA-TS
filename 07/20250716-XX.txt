00:42:01.852 --> 00:42:03.187
COMMUNITY. CREATE HAZARDS BY

00:42:03.254 --> 00:42:04.922
BLOCKING STREETS AND SIDEWALKS,

00:42:04.989 --> 00:42:06.824
AND FREQUENTLY END UP IN OUR

00:42:06.891 --> 00:42:08.325
CREEKS AND WATERWAYS. I'VE BEEN

00:42:08.392 --> 00:42:10.227
IN BUSINESS FOR MANY YEARS AS A

00:42:10.294 --> 00:42:11.929
COMMERCIAL PROPERTY OWNER, AND

00:42:11.996 --> 00:42:13.497
HAVE WORKED WITH RETAIL TENANTS

00:42:13.564 --> 00:42:14.999
TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF

00:42:15.065 --> 00:42:17.167
ABANDONED SHOPPING CARTS, SO I

00:42:17.234 --> 00:42:18.936
UNDERSTAND ALL TOO WELL. WE NEED

00:42:19.003 --> 00:42:20.804
A SOLUTION THAT KEEPS OUR CITIES

00:42:20.871 --> 00:42:22.306
CLEAN AS OUR RESIDENTS DESERVE

00:42:22.373 --> 00:42:25.042
AND EXPECT, AND TREATS THE

00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:27.978
RETAILERS FAIRLY. I BELIEVE SB

00:42:28.045 --> 00:42:30.481
753 STRIKES THAT BALANCE. SAN

00:42:30.547 --> 00:42:32.650
JOSE'S GOAL IS TO RETRIEVE THESE

00:42:32.716 --> 00:42:34.118
CARTS AND RETURN THEM TO THEIR

00:42:34.184 --> 00:42:35.819
OWNERS AS EFFICIENTLY AS

00:42:35.886 --> 00:42:37.454
POSSIBLE, BUT STATE LAW MAKES

00:42:37.521 --> 00:42:39.156
THE PROCESS BURDENSOME AND

00:42:39.223 --> 00:42:40.457
DIFFICULT. AND UNDER CURRENT

00:42:40.524 --> 00:42:42.760
LAW, CITIES MUST STORE THESE

00:42:42.826 --> 00:42:43.861
CARTS IN AN IMPOUND LOT WHERE

00:42:43.928 --> 00:42:46.330
THEY SIT FOR UP TO 30 DAYS, OR

00:42:46.397 --> 00:42:48.699
UNTIL A RETAILER RETRIEVES THEM.

00:42:48.766 --> 00:42:51.035
THIS OUTDATED, IMPRACTICAL

00:42:51.101 --> 00:42:52.202
PROCESS IS CHALLENGING AND

00:42:52.269 --> 00:42:53.804
EXPENSIVE TO IMPLEMENT,

00:42:53.871 --> 00:42:55.005
ESPECIALLY FOR LARGE CITIES LIKE

00:42:55.072 --> 00:42:57.374
THE CITY OF SAN JOSE. WE WOULD

00:42:57.441 --> 00:42:59.276
NEED TO STORE HUNDREDS OF

00:42:59.343 --> 00:43:01.045
ABANDONED SHOPPING CARTS AT ANY

00:43:01.111 --> 00:43:02.880
GIVEN TIME. WE BELIEVE THERE'S A

00:43:02.947 --> 00:43:05.049
BETTER, MORE EFFECTIVE WAY TO

00:43:05.115 --> 00:43:07.117
RETRIEVE CARTS AND ELIMINATE

00:43:07.184 --> 00:43:10.721
UNNECESSARY DELAY AND COSTS. SB

00:43:10.788 --> 00:43:13.290
753 SEEKS TO MODERNIZE THE LAW

00:43:13.357 --> 00:43:14.325
REGULATING THE COLLECTION OF

00:43:14.391 --> 00:43:15.759
ABANDONED SHOPPING CARTS BY

00:43:15.826 --> 00:43:17.561
PROVIDING LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

00:43:17.628 --> 00:43:20.164
THE OPTION TO RETURN CARTS

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:21.966
DIRECTLY TO RETAILERS BY PICKING

00:43:22.032 --> 00:43:23.867
THEM UP IMMEDIATELY RETURNING TO

00:43:23.934 --> 00:43:25.703
THEM. THIS LEGISLATION ACHIEVES

00:43:25.769 --> 00:43:27.705
THE RIGHT BALANCE OF CREATING AN

00:43:27.771 --> 00:43:29.907
EFFICIENT, COST EFFECTIVE SYSTEM

00:43:29.974 --> 00:43:31.342
TO REMOVE ABANDONED SHOPPING

00:43:31.408 --> 00:43:33.243
CARTS WHILE ALLOWING CITIES TO

00:43:33.310 --> 00:43:34.611
RECOVER THEIR COSTS FOR

00:43:34.678 --> 00:43:37.014
PROVIDING THE SERVICE UP TO A

00:43:37.081 --> 00:43:39.583
CAP SET IN THE STATUTE. THIS

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:40.985
LEGISLATION WILL MODERNIZE AN

00:43:41.051 --> 00:43:42.820
OUTDATED SYSTEM AND PROVIDE

00:43:42.886 --> 00:43:44.288
CITIES WITH A BETTER TOOL FOR

00:43:44.355 --> 00:43:46.457
CLEANING UP STREETS,

00:43:46.523 --> 00:43:48.592
NEIGHBORHOODS AND OUR PRECIOUS

00:43:48.659 --> 00:43:50.861
WATERWAYS. WITH THAT, I

00:43:50.928 --> 00:43:51.795
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR

00:43:51.862 --> 00:43:56.800
SUPPORT FOR SB 753. THANK YOU.

00:43:56.867 --> 00:43:58.435
OKAY, GOOD AFTERNOON, CHAIR AND

00:43:58.502 --> 00:43:59.803
COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS

00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:01.939
CAROLINE GRINDER. I'M HERE ON

00:44:02.006 --> 00:44:02.439
BEHALF OF THE LEAGUE OF

00:44:02.506 --> 00:44:03.007
CALIFORNIA CITIES, WHICH IS

00:44:03.073 --> 00:44:05.275
PROUD TO SUPPORT SB 753.

00:44:05.342 --> 00:44:06.176
ABANDONED SHOPPING CARTS ARE A

00:44:06.243 --> 00:44:07.277
GROWING PROBLEM ACROSS

00:44:07.344 --> 00:44:08.379
CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITIES,

00:44:08.445 --> 00:44:09.780
BLOCKING STREETS AND SIDEWALKS,

00:44:09.847 --> 00:44:11.715
POLLUTING WATERWAYS AND PARKS,

00:44:11.782 --> 00:44:13.050
AND STRAINING OUR CITY

00:44:13.117 --> 00:44:14.885
RESOURCES. SB 753 OFFERS A

00:44:14.952 --> 00:44:16.620
COMMON SENSE UPDATE TO OUTDATED

00:44:16.687 --> 00:44:18.422
LAWS THAT NO LONGER REFLECT THE

00:44:18.489 --> 00:44:20.691
SCALE OR NATURE OF THE PROBLEM.

00:44:20.758 --> 00:44:23.660
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. UNDER

00:44:23.727 --> 00:44:24.595
CURRENT LAW, CITIES ARE

00:44:24.661 --> 00:44:25.629
PREVENTED FROM RETRIEVING

00:44:25.696 --> 00:44:26.764
ABANDONED CARTS UNTIL THE

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:28.165
RETAILER IS NOTIFIED AND

00:44:28.232 --> 00:44:29.166
REQUIRES CITIES TO STORE CARDS

00:44:29.233 --> 00:44:30.901
AT AN IMPOUND LOT. THIS APPROACH

00:44:30.968 --> 00:44:33.003
IS INEFFICIENT, COSTLY, AND

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:33.604
BURDENSOME. YOU'VE HEARD FROM

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:35.739
THE CITY OF SAN JOSE, WHICH IS

00:44:35.806 --> 00:44:36.974
DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE AT A

00:44:37.041 --> 00:44:38.342
REALLY LARGE SCALE. BUT SMALLER

00:44:38.409 --> 00:44:39.276
CITIES HAVE SIMILAR EXPERIENCES

00:44:39.343 --> 00:44:40.511
AND CONCERNS WITH EXISTING LAW.

00:44:40.577 --> 00:44:41.879
IN CITIES LIKE CONCORD,

00:44:41.945 --> 00:44:42.913
RESIDENTS AND MAINTENANCE STAFF

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:44.548
FREQUENTLY ENCOUNTER CARTS

00:44:44.615 --> 00:44:45.816
DISCARDED IN PARKS, RESIDENTIAL

00:44:45.883 --> 00:44:46.950
NEIGHBORHOODS, AND COMMERCIAL

00:44:47.017 --> 00:44:48.318
AREAS. IN RESPONSE, THE CITY HAS

00:44:48.385 --> 00:44:49.386
IMPLEMENTED A DEDICATED

00:44:49.453 --> 00:44:51.388
REPORTING SYSTEM JUST TO MANAGE

00:44:51.455 --> 00:44:52.689
THE OVERWHELMING VOLUME OF

00:44:52.756 --> 00:44:54.091
COMPLAINTS AND COORDINATE COSTLY

00:44:54.158 --> 00:44:55.826
RETRIEVAL EFFORTS IN THE CITY OF

00:44:55.893 --> 00:44:57.594
SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO. THEY'VE

00:44:57.661 --> 00:44:58.896
IDENTIFIED IDENTIFIED ABANDONED

00:44:58.962 --> 00:45:00.164
CARTS AS A DIRECT THREAT TO

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:02.566
PUBLIC SAFETY, POSING HAZARDS TO

00:45:02.633 --> 00:45:05.269
BOTH PEDESTRIANS AND DRIVERS.

00:45:05.335 --> 00:45:07.337
CITIES AGREE THAT SB 753 WOULD

00:45:07.404 --> 00:45:08.872
FINALLY CREATE THE FLEXIBILITY

00:45:08.939 --> 00:45:10.974
FOR CITIES TO ACT QUICKLY AND

00:45:11.041 --> 00:45:12.009
EFFECTIVELY. SB 753 WOULD ALLOW

00:45:12.076 --> 00:45:14.144
OUR CITIES TO BYPASS THAT COSTLY

00:45:14.211 --> 00:45:15.245
IMPOUND PROCESS, RETURNING CARTS

00:45:15.312 --> 00:45:16.747
DIRECTLY TO RETAILERS,

00:45:16.814 --> 00:45:17.781
ELIMINATING THE UNNECESSARY

00:45:17.848 --> 00:45:19.283
THREE DAY WAIT PERIOD, AND

00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:20.784
ENABLING THE RECOVERY OF ACTUAL

00:45:20.851 --> 00:45:22.086
COSTS. THIS WOULD INCENTIVIZE

00:45:22.152 --> 00:45:23.320
BETTER COLLABORATION BETWEEN OUR

00:45:23.387 --> 00:45:24.822
RETAILERS AND OUR CITIES,

00:45:24.888 --> 00:45:26.290
ENSURING THAT STOLEN PROPERTY IS

00:45:26.356 --> 00:45:28.659
RETURNED QUICKLY. SB 753

00:45:28.725 --> 00:45:30.094
RECOGNIZES THE REALITY ON THE

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:31.095
GROUND THAT CURRENT LAW HAS NOT

00:45:31.161 --> 00:45:33.831
KEPT PACE WITH WHAT CITIES ARE

00:45:33.897 --> 00:45:34.364
FACING DAY TO DAY IN OUR

00:45:34.431 --> 00:45:36.266
COMMUNITIES. FOR THESE REASONS,

00:45:36.333 --> 00:45:36.867
WE'RE PROUD TO SUPPORT SB 753

00:45:36.934 --> 00:45:38.535

THANK YOU. ANY PRIMARY WITNESSES

00:46:48.572 --> 00:46:50.541
SUPPORT IS STILL IN SUPPORT.

00:46:50.607 --> 00:46:52.276
KERRY WEST WITH THE CITY OF

GOOD AFTERNOON. CHAIR DANIEL

CONWAY WITH THE CALIFORNIA

GROCERS ASSOCIATION HERE TO

00:47:14.565 --> 00:47:15.866
EXPRESS OUR STRONG OPPOSITION

00:47:15.933 --> 00:47:17.834
THIS AFTERNOON. I THINK I HEARD

00:47:17.901 --> 00:47:19.937
THE WORD MODERNIZATION USED LIKE

00:47:20.003 --> 00:47:21.672
37 TIMES IN TWO MINUTES. BUT I

00:47:21.738 --> 00:47:23.273
THINK FROM READING THE STAFF

00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:24.341
ANALYSIS, IT'S CLEAR THAT THIS

00:47:24.408 --> 00:47:26.777
BILL IS REALLY MORE OF BACK TO

00:47:26.843 --> 00:47:27.911
THE FUTURE, RIGHT? WHERE WHAT

00:47:27.978 --> 00:47:29.913
WE'VE HAD IS WE'VE HAD A WELL

00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:31.281
ORGANIZED POLICY FRAMEWORK IN

00:47:31.348 --> 00:47:33.383
THE STATE FOR NEARLY THREE

00:47:33.450 --> 00:47:34.351
DECADES, AND NOW WE HAVE AN

00:47:34.418 --> 00:47:35.686
ATTEMPT TO ESSENTIALLY UNDERMINE

00:47:35.752 --> 00:47:37.120
THAT. SO I WANT TO TALK ABOUT

00:47:37.187 --> 00:47:39.423
HOW WE GOT HERE. WE WERE

00:47:39.489 --> 00:47:40.791
CONTACTED BY THE CITY OF SAN

00:47:40.857 --> 00:47:42.893
JOSE LATE LAST YEAR WITH THEIR

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:44.795
CONCERNS ABOUT SHOPPING CARTS

00:47:44.861 --> 00:47:46.230
AND OTHER TRASH ENDING UP IN A

00:47:46.296 --> 00:47:48.732
RIVER IN THE CITY, AND THE

00:47:48.799 --> 00:47:49.366
CONCERNS THAT THAT WAS GOING TO

00:47:49.433 --> 00:47:50.968
LEAD TO A CLEAN WATER ACT

00:47:51.034 --> 00:47:51.868
VIOLATION AND FINES FOR THE

00:47:51.935 --> 00:47:53.737
CITY. WE SAID, THAT'S TERRIBLE.

00:47:53.804 --> 00:47:56.273
HOW CAN WE HELP? NEXT THING WE

00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:57.407
KNOW, THERE WAS LANGUAGE MOVING

00:47:57.474 --> 00:47:57.975
THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE TO

00:47:58.041 --> 00:47:59.476
ADDRESS THIS. I THINK OUR

00:47:59.543 --> 00:48:01.778
CONCERN IS THAT TO THE EXTENT

00:48:01.845 --> 00:48:03.313
THAT THIS IS ABOUT TRASH ENDING

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:05.215
UP IN THE RIVER FROM HOMELESS

00:48:05.282 --> 00:48:06.016
ENCAMPMENTS. THIS BILL DOES

00:48:06.083 --> 00:48:07.884
NOTHING TO ADDRESS THAT, RIGHT.

00:48:07.951 --> 00:48:08.919
THIS DOES NOTHING TO ADDRESS

00:48:08.986 --> 00:48:10.454
ENCAMPMENTS. IT DOES NOTHING TO

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:11.788
ADDRESS TRASH GETTING IN THERE.

00:48:11.855 --> 00:48:12.856
NOTHING. WHAT THIS BILL

00:48:12.923 --> 00:48:14.658
BASICALLY DOES IS IT GIVES

00:48:14.725 --> 00:48:15.726
CITIES ONE TOOL, THE ABILITY TO

00:48:15.792 --> 00:48:17.461
CHARGE US MORE TO RETRIEVE OUR

00:48:17.527 --> 00:48:18.996
STOLEN PROPERTY. AND I GUESS I

00:48:19.062 --> 00:48:20.697
JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE IT FROM

00:48:20.764 --> 00:48:22.199
THE PERSPECTIVE OF OUR MEMBERS.

00:48:22.266 --> 00:48:23.267
LIKE, THIS ISN'T LITTER, RIGHT?

00:48:23.333 --> 00:48:24.334
THIS ISN'T THAT WE'RE BEING

00:48:24.401 --> 00:48:25.802
CARELESS WITH OUR PROPERTY. OUR

00:48:25.869 --> 00:48:27.070
PROPERTY IS BEING STOLEN AND

00:48:27.137 --> 00:48:28.672
TAKEN OFF SITE. AND NOW THE

00:48:28.739 --> 00:48:29.906
CONVERSATION WE'VE BEEN HAVING

00:48:29.973 --> 00:48:31.074
WITH SIX MONTHS FOR THE CITY OF

00:48:31.141 --> 00:48:33.176
SAN JOSE IS HOW MUCH ARE WE

00:48:33.243 --> 00:48:35.012
WILLING TO PAY TO GET OUR STOLEN

00:48:35.078 --> 00:48:36.580
PROPERTY BACK? AND SO I THINK

00:48:36.647 --> 00:48:37.781
FOR US, IT'S BEEN PROBLEMATIC

00:48:37.848 --> 00:48:39.916
ALL ALONG. THAT SAID, WE'VE HAD

00:48:39.983 --> 00:48:40.584
SEVERAL PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS

00:48:40.651 --> 00:48:41.184
WITH THE SENATOR AND HIS TEAM,

00:48:41.251 --> 00:48:42.686
AND WE'VE TRIED WE OFFERED

00:48:42.753 --> 00:48:44.021
AMENDMENTS TO TRY TO ADDRESS

00:48:44.087 --> 00:48:44.955
THEIR CONCERNS AROUND

00:48:45.022 --> 00:48:45.889
IMPOUNDMENT, AROUND THE TIMING

00:48:45.956 --> 00:48:47.124
OF RETRIEVING THE CARTS, THINGS

00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:48.458
LIKE THAT. AND UNFORTUNATELY, WE

00:48:48.525 --> 00:48:50.360
GOT NOWHERE. AND SO FOR US,

00:48:50.427 --> 00:48:52.095
WE'RE ONCE AGAIN IN STRONG

00:48:52.162 --> 00:48:52.796
OPPOSITION. AT THE END OF THE

00:48:52.863 --> 00:48:54.798
DAY, WHAT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING

00:48:54.865 --> 00:48:56.833
FOR IS TO MAINTAIN THAT RIGHT OF

00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:57.968
RETRIEVAL, RIGHT? IF OUR

00:48:58.035 --> 00:48:58.669
PROPERTY GETS STOLEN, IF

00:48:58.735 --> 00:49:00.137
SOMEBODY STOLE YOUR IPAD, LIKE,

00:49:00.203 --> 00:49:01.171
SHOULDN'T YOU AT LEAST HAVE SOME

00:49:01.238 --> 00:49:02.639
OPPORTUNITY TO GET IT BACK

00:49:02.706 --> 00:49:04.074
WITHOUT HAVING TO PAY TO GET

00:49:04.141 --> 00:49:05.242
YOUR STOLEN PROPERTY BACK?

00:49:05.309 --> 00:49:06.243
RIGHT. AND THEN BEYOND THAT, YOU

00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:07.678
KNOW, WE REALLY HAVE CONCERNS

00:49:07.744 --> 00:49:08.578
ABOUT COST CONTROLS. THIS

00:49:08.645 --> 00:49:10.480
PROPOSAL FROM THE CITY OF SAN

00:49:10.547 --> 00:49:11.581
JOSE CAME ABOUT DURING THE

00:49:11.648 --> 00:49:12.649
BUDGET PROCESS. RIGHT. SO MAYOR

00:49:12.716 --> 00:49:14.151
MEHAN HAS A HOMELESSNESS PROBLEM

00:49:14.217 --> 00:49:15.919
AND A BUDGET PROBLEM. RIGHT. AND

00:49:15.986 --> 00:49:17.587
HIS SOLUTION IS TO TRY TO SOLVE

00:49:17.654 --> 00:49:19.289
BOTH OF THOSE BY CHARGING

00:49:19.356 --> 00:49:20.257
RETAILERS MORE TO GET THEIR

00:49:20.324 --> 00:49:21.858
STOLEN PROPERTY BACK. WE DON'T

00:49:21.925 --> 00:49:23.427
THINK THAT THAT'S A HEALTHY

00:49:23.493 --> 00:49:24.628
DYNAMIC OR AN APPROPRIATE SET OF

00:49:24.695 --> 00:49:26.196
INCENTIVES FOR ANYONE INVOLVED.

00:49:26.263 --> 00:49:28.165
SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING

00:49:28.231 --> 00:49:29.833
WITH THE CITY OF SAN JOSE AND

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:31.668
OUR PARTNERS AT THE LEAGUE OF

00:49:31.735 --> 00:49:32.169
CITIES TO ADDRESS THESE

00:49:32.235 --> 00:49:33.770
CONCERNS, BECAUSE THEY ARE THEY

00:49:33.837 --> 00:49:35.639
CAN BE REAL. BUT IN TERMS OF

00:49:35.706 --> 00:49:36.673
JUST CREATING A NEW REVENUE

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:38.442
STREAM FOR CITIES WITH BUDGET

00:49:38.508 --> 00:49:39.876
PROBLEMS, WE DON'T WANT THAT

00:49:39.943 --> 00:49:40.977
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THIS IS

00:49:41.044 --> 00:49:43.146
SOMETHING THAT BECOMES A COST

00:49:43.213 --> 00:49:45.382
FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND YOUR

00:49:45.449 --> 00:49:47.050
CONSTITUENTS. SO WITH THAT,

00:49:47.117 --> 00:49:49.086
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.

00:49:49.152 --> 00:49:51.088
ALL RIGHT. GOOD AFTERNOON, CHAIR

00:49:51.154 --> 00:49:53.023
CARRILLO AND MEMBERS. MY NAME IS

00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:54.624
RYAN ELAINE. I'M WITH THE

00:49:54.691 --> 00:49:55.058
CALIFORNIA RETAILERS

00:49:55.125 --> 00:49:55.892
ASSOCIATION. FIRST, I WANT TO

00:49:55.959 --> 00:49:56.960
APOLOGIZE FOR NOT GETTING OUR

00:49:57.027 --> 00:49:59.262
LETTER IN ON TIME, BUT I AM HERE

00:49:59.329 --> 00:50:00.530
AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSED UNLESS

00:50:00.597 --> 00:50:01.598
AMENDED POSITION I WANT TO

00:50:01.665 --> 00:50:02.299
HIGHLIGHT. WE'VE HAD

00:50:02.366 --> 00:50:03.800
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SENATOR'S

00:50:03.867 --> 00:50:05.902
STAFF, AND WE CONTINUE TO HAVE

00:50:05.969 --> 00:50:07.938
THOSE. OUR CONCERNS PRIMARILY

00:50:08.004 --> 00:50:09.373
STEM FROM THE COST RECOVERY THAT

00:50:09.439 --> 00:50:10.941
CITIES CAN CAN APPLY TO

00:50:11.007 --> 00:50:12.709
RETAILERS UNDER THIS BILL,

00:50:12.776 --> 00:50:13.977
INCLUSIVE OF THE PROPOSED

00:50:14.044 --> 00:50:15.078
AMENDMENTS BY THE COMMITTEE.

00:50:15.145 --> 00:50:16.380
WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE CAP ON

00:50:16.446 --> 00:50:17.848
COSTS FROM WHAT IT PREVIOUSLY

00:50:17.914 --> 00:50:19.883
WAS AS HAVING NO CAP,

00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:21.618
UNFORTUNATELY $500 PER CART IS

00:50:21.685 --> 00:50:22.953
FAIRLY STEEP AND ACTUALLY COSTS

00:50:23.019 --> 00:50:25.756
MORE THAN NEARLY ALL CARTS. MOST

00:50:25.822 --> 00:50:26.857
IMPORTANTLY, WE WOULD LIKE TO

00:50:26.923 --> 00:50:28.558
ALLOW OUR MEMBERS THE FIRST

00:50:28.625 --> 00:50:29.593
RIGHT TO RETRIEVAL OF THE CARTS

00:50:29.659 --> 00:50:31.061
INSTEAD OF COMPETING WITH CITIES

00:50:31.128 --> 00:50:32.396
THAT WILL SOON HAVE A

00:50:32.462 --> 00:50:34.030
SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL INCENTIVE

00:50:34.097 --> 00:50:36.833
TO RETURN CARTS AT $500 APIECE.

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:37.868
ADDITIONALLY, IT'S UNCLEAR IF

00:50:37.934 --> 00:50:40.837
THE FINE ON HERE FOR CARTS NOT

00:50:40.904 --> 00:50:41.838
RETRIEVED WITHIN THREE DAYS CAN

00:50:41.905 --> 00:50:45.075
BE THAT CAN BE IMPOSED PER

00:50:45.142 --> 00:50:46.276
OCCURRENCE AS DEFINED IN. THE

00:50:46.343 --> 00:50:48.645
BILL COULD BE ADDED ON TO THAT

00:50:48.712 --> 00:50:50.580
$500 ACTUAL COST RECOVERY. SO

00:50:50.647 --> 00:50:52.682
WE'RE I'M KIND OF I NEED TO SEE

00:50:52.749 --> 00:50:54.117
WHAT THE LANGUAGE COMES OUT TO.

00:50:54.184 --> 00:50:56.219
BUT THAT COULD POSSIBLY LEAD UP

00:50:56.286 --> 00:50:56.953
TO $650 FOR CARTS IF THEY WERE

00:50:57.020 --> 00:51:01.658
OUT FOR THREE DAYS. AND ARGUABLY

00:51:01.725 --> 00:51:03.026
THAT COULD JUST, IN OUR VIEW, BE

00:51:03.093 --> 00:51:04.861
A CASH GRAB OPPORTUNITY AT THE

00:51:04.928 --> 00:51:05.695
EXPENSE OF RETAILERS HAVING

00:51:05.762 --> 00:51:07.697
CARTS TAKEN OFF THEIR PROPERTY.

00:51:07.764 --> 00:51:08.832
LASTLY, THERE IS NO

00:51:08.899 --> 00:51:10.000
CONSIDERATION IN THE BILL OR IN

00:51:10.066 --> 00:51:12.035
THE AMENDMENTS OF THE LOCATION

00:51:12.102 --> 00:51:14.571
OF CARTS THAT ARE INACCESSIBLE

00:51:14.638 --> 00:51:15.806
FOR RETAILERS TO RETRIEVE, SUCH

00:51:15.872 --> 00:51:17.073
AS PRIVATE PROPERTY EASEMENTS

00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:18.675
PROHIBITING ACCESS, REFUSAL TO

00:51:18.742 --> 00:51:20.710
TURN OVER THREATS OF VIOLENCE,

00:51:20.777 --> 00:51:23.713
AND SO ON. AND THAT INCLUDES IN

00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:25.715
WATERWAYS. AND I'LL JUST ADD, I

00:51:25.782 --> 00:51:27.484
WAS ACTUALLY IN THE BAY AREA

00:51:27.551 --> 00:51:28.819
THIS WEEKEND, AND I SAW SHOPPING

00:51:28.885 --> 00:51:30.387
CART ON BART. SO I'M CURIOUS HOW

00:51:30.454 --> 00:51:31.788
THAT ONE WOULD BE RETRIEVED AS

00:51:31.855 --> 00:51:33.156
WELL AND WHERE IT WOULD BE

00:51:33.223 --> 00:51:36.393
RETURNED TO. SO SHOULD A

00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:38.662
SHOPPING CART BE STOLEN FROM OUR

00:51:38.728 --> 00:51:40.163
STORES THEN DUMPED IN AN

00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:40.797
ACCESSIBLE AREA? RETAILERS WOULD

00:51:40.864 --> 00:51:43.099
THEN HAVE TO EAT THE PRICE OF

00:51:43.166 --> 00:51:44.868
THE CART THAT IS LIKELY DAMAGED,

00:51:44.935 --> 00:51:46.136
DEPENDING ON THE LOCATION THAT

00:51:46.203 --> 00:51:47.404
IS DUMPED AT AND ADDITION TO THE

00:51:47.471 --> 00:51:48.738
$500 COST RECOVERY LEVIED BY THE

00:51:48.805 --> 00:51:50.140
CITY. I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT AGAIN

00:51:50.207 --> 00:51:51.775
THAT CRA IS MORE THAN WILLING TO

00:51:51.842 --> 00:51:53.844
CONTINUE TO WORK, AND I THINK WE

00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:56.012
COULD FIND SOME PATH FORWARD.

00:51:56.079 --> 00:51:57.647
APPRECIATE THE SENATOR AND HIS

00:51:57.714 --> 00:51:58.148
STAFF. I APPRECIATE THE

00:51:58.215 --> 00:51:59.015
COMMITTEE, BUT AT THIS TIME WE

00:51:59.082 --> 00:52:00.717
JUST ASK FOR WE'RE IN

00:52:00.784 --> 00:52:01.718
OPPOSITION, AS AMENDED. THANK

00:52:01.785 --> 00:52:03.820
YOU, THANK YOU. ANY OTHERS I

00:52:03.887 --> 00:52:04.988
WANT TO ADD ON THE OPPOSITION,

00:52:05.055 --> 00:52:07.357
PLEASE COME UP TO THE MIC.

00:52:07.424 --> 00:52:10.327
SEEING NO OPPOSITION, TAKING IT

00:52:10.393 --> 00:52:12.162
BACK TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

00:52:12.229 --> 00:52:13.263
QUESTIONS? COMMENTS. ASSEMBLY

00:52:13.330 --> 00:52:15.398
MEMBER WARD. GREAT. THANK YOU,

00:52:15.465 --> 00:52:16.867
SENATOR, AND TO OUR CITIES AND

00:52:16.933 --> 00:52:18.001
REPRESENTATIVES FOR BRINGING

00:52:18.068 --> 00:52:20.537
THIS ISSUE FORWARD. I THINKING

00:52:20.604 --> 00:52:24.074
ABOUT I TRY TO MAYBE

00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:25.008
DE-ESCALATE, YOU KNOW, SOME OF

00:52:25.075 --> 00:52:26.743
THE RATIONALE AND BECAUSE WHAT I

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:29.346
SEE HERE IS JUST A VERY KIND OF

00:52:29.412 --> 00:52:31.848
BASIC INCIDENT AND TRANSACTION

00:52:31.915 --> 00:52:33.617
AND WHO SHOULD PAY FOR IT? HOW

00:52:33.683 --> 00:52:35.418
ARE WE GOING TO REMEDY IT? SO

00:52:35.485 --> 00:52:36.786
I'M NERVOUS ABOUT THE IDEA THAT

00:52:36.853 --> 00:52:41.658
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO FIND A GROCER.

00:52:41.725 --> 00:52:43.593
THEY DID NOT TAKE THEIR CART TO

00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:46.029
THE PARK, RIGHT. THEY DID NOT

00:52:46.096 --> 00:52:46.763
PUT IT IN THERE. I GET YOU

00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:48.899
NEEDED OUT OF THE PARK. THIS IS

00:52:48.965 --> 00:52:51.101
KIND OF LIKE, YOU KNOW, A LOSE

00:52:51.167 --> 00:52:52.135
LOSE SITUATION HERE BECAUSE WE

00:52:52.202 --> 00:52:54.104
DON'T WANT IT OVER HERE OR IT IS

00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:56.106
CAUSING A CLEAN WATER ACT ISSUE

00:52:56.172 --> 00:52:56.840
IN THE STORMWATER CHANNELS OR

00:52:56.907 --> 00:52:58.141
WHEREVER IT ENDED UP. RIGHT. AND

00:52:58.208 --> 00:53:00.110
SO THAT COMES ON THE PUBLIC

00:53:00.176 --> 00:53:02.045
SECTOR. IT COMES ON TAXPAYERS TO

00:53:02.112 --> 00:53:03.046
HAVE TO BE ABLE TO RESOLVE. AND

00:53:03.113 --> 00:53:05.015
MAYBE AND WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT

00:53:05.081 --> 00:53:06.550
WAYS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT

00:53:06.616 --> 00:53:08.051
WHOLE. AND, AND WE KNOW HOW IT

00:53:08.118 --> 00:53:09.953
GOT FROM A TO B AND WE'RE NOT

00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:12.022
GOING TO BE ABLE TO COST RECOVER

00:53:12.088 --> 00:53:13.123
YOU KNOW FROM, FROM THAT, THAT,

00:53:13.189 --> 00:53:15.825
THAT, THAT, THAT THAT PERSON. IT

00:53:15.892 --> 00:53:16.960
JUST IT SEEMS THAT A FINE IS A

00:53:17.027 --> 00:53:18.528
LITTLE BIT UNJUST, I GUESS

00:53:18.595 --> 00:53:19.729
BECAUSE IT WASN'T THEIR FAULT.

00:53:19.796 --> 00:53:21.231
HOW DO I FIND SOMEBODY WHEN IT

00:53:21.298 --> 00:53:22.532
WASN'T THEIR FAULT TO BEGIN

00:53:22.599 --> 00:53:24.634
WITH? OF COURSE THEY DON'T WANT

00:53:24.701 --> 00:53:25.302
THEIR CART TO LEAVE THEIR THEIR

00:53:25.368 --> 00:53:27.704
PROPERTY. BUT I HAVE HEARD IN

00:53:27.771 --> 00:53:28.538
CONVERSATION LEADING UP TO THIS

00:53:28.605 --> 00:53:29.973
TODAY THAT THERE IS AN OPENNESS

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:31.641
OR AN INTEREST. I WOULD LIKE TO

00:53:31.708 --> 00:53:33.043
HEAR YOUR LEVEL OF COMMITMENT TO

00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:34.778
BE ABLE TO AT LEAST TRY TO GIVE

00:53:34.844 --> 00:53:36.680
THEM A CHANCE TO RECOVER

00:53:36.746 --> 00:53:37.781
THEMSELVES, SO THEY DON'T EVEN

00:53:37.847 --> 00:53:38.815
BEGIN THE PROCESS OF NEEDING TO

00:53:38.882 --> 00:53:39.849
UTILIZE UP TO $500 OF PUBLIC

00:53:39.916 --> 00:53:41.952
PERSONNEL TO BE ABLE TO RECOVER

00:53:42.018 --> 00:53:44.421
IN THE FIRST PLACE, LET ALONE

00:53:44.487 --> 00:53:46.056
THE FINE ON TOP OF THAT. OKAY.

00:53:46.122 --> 00:53:46.690
YES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIS

00:53:46.756 --> 00:53:49.025
IS A GREAT CLARIFICATIONS TO

00:53:49.092 --> 00:53:51.428
REQUEST. AND LET ME JUST DO

00:53:51.494 --> 00:53:52.796
SOMETHING I DIDN'T DO EARLIER. I

00:53:52.862 --> 00:53:54.364
KNOW THE CHAIR WILL APPRECIATE

00:53:54.431 --> 00:53:57.167
THAT AS MAKE IT CLEAR THAT WE'RE

00:53:57.233 --> 00:53:58.568
TAKING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS

00:53:58.635 --> 00:54:00.437
ON THIS BILL. AND THE COMMITTEE

00:54:00.503 --> 00:54:01.838
AMENDMENTS, I THOUGHT, WENT A

00:54:01.905 --> 00:54:03.206
LONG WAY TOWARD ADDRESSING SOME

00:54:03.273 --> 00:54:06.209
OF THIS. FOR EXAMPLE, THEY MAKE

00:54:06.276 --> 00:54:08.011
IT CLEAR IN THE BILL THAT THE

00:54:08.078 --> 00:54:09.379
CITY OR COUNTY HAS TO ADOPT AN

00:54:09.446 --> 00:54:10.814
ACTUAL ORDINANCE TO ALLOW COST

00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:12.449
RECOVERY FOR THE RETRIEVAL AND

00:54:12.515 --> 00:54:15.151
THE RETURN OF SHOPPING CARTS. SO

00:54:15.218 --> 00:54:16.886
THERE'S THAT HEARING. AND, YOU

00:54:16.953 --> 00:54:18.321
KNOW, THE FOLKS HERE IN

00:54:18.388 --> 00:54:19.923
OPPOSITION OR WHOEVER THE LOCAL

00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:20.824
FOLKS ARE, HAVE EVERY

00:54:20.890 --> 00:54:22.392
OPPORTUNITY LIKE THEY DO AT CITY

00:54:22.459 --> 00:54:25.061
COUNCIL MEETINGS TO, TO COME IN

00:54:25.128 --> 00:54:26.997
AND, AND ADDRESS, SHOULD THERE

00:54:27.063 --> 00:54:29.332
BE A FEE, SHOULD IT BE X, SHOULD

00:54:29.399 --> 00:54:33.069
IT BE APPLIED CITYWIDE? SHOULD

00:54:33.136 --> 00:54:34.771
IT BE IN CERTAIN AREAS? SHOULD

00:54:34.838 --> 00:54:36.006
IT BE WAIVED IN BUSINESS

00:54:36.072 --> 00:54:37.841
DISTRICTS, FOR EXAMPLE? ALL THAT

00:54:37.907 --> 00:54:40.043
CAN BE DONE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:41.544
WITH AN ORDINANCE. WHAT WE

00:54:41.611 --> 00:54:43.947
STARTED TO LET ME REPEAT THE LET

00:54:44.014 --> 00:54:45.181
ME INDICATE WHAT THE OTHER TWO

00:54:45.248 --> 00:54:45.982
AMENDMENTS ARE JUST FOR

00:54:46.049 --> 00:54:48.385
EVERYBODY'S BENEFIT. THE NEXT

00:54:48.451 --> 00:54:50.387
AMENDMENT REQUIRES THAT THE

00:54:50.453 --> 00:54:51.488
ORDINANCE DESCRIBE HOW THE

00:54:51.554 --> 00:54:53.657
ACTUAL COST OF RETRIEVAL WILL BE

00:54:53.723 --> 00:54:57.193
DETERMINED. SO THAT'S CLEAR. THE

00:54:57.260 --> 00:54:59.562
CAP ON ACTUAL COST RECOVERY, NO

00:54:59.629 --> 00:55:01.231
MATTER WHAT IT COSTS, IF THE

00:55:01.297 --> 00:55:04.200
CITY SPENDS $400 FISHING GOLF

00:55:04.267 --> 00:55:06.002
CARTS FROM A CERTAIN RETAILER

00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:08.104
OUT OF OUT OF THE RIPARIAN

00:55:08.171 --> 00:55:10.507
CORRIDOR, THE CAP IS $150 BASED

00:55:10.573 --> 00:55:12.475
ON THE AMENDMENTS. AND THEN

00:55:12.542 --> 00:55:15.111
THERE'S A RE. THE BILL NOW WITH

00:55:15.178 --> 00:55:16.079
THE AMENDMENTS REINSTATES A

00:55:16.146 --> 00:55:18.181
CLEAR FINE AMOUNT OF $150 PER

00:55:18.248 --> 00:55:19.983
ABANDONED SHOPPING CART THAT'S

00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:21.785
NOT RETRIEVED THREE DAYS AFTER

00:55:21.851 --> 00:55:23.620
ACTUAL NOTICE IS PROVIDED TO THE

00:55:23.687 --> 00:55:26.423
CART OWNER, SO YOU CAN SHOW UP

00:55:26.489 --> 00:55:28.658
WITHIN THAT THREE DAY PERIOD AND

00:55:28.725 --> 00:55:30.460
AVOID THAT. SO THERE'S A LOT OF

00:55:30.527 --> 00:55:32.562
AVOIDANCE MECHANISMS IN HERE.

00:55:32.629 --> 00:55:34.364
THERE'S NOTHING IN THE BILL THAT

00:55:34.431 --> 00:55:37.534
STOPS. AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR ON

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:40.904
THIS BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY

00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:42.272
REPRESENTING THE OPPOSITION WHO

00:55:42.338 --> 00:55:43.873
I DON'T BELIEVE IS HERE TODAY,

00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:45.141
REACHED OUT TO ME THIS MORNING

00:55:45.208 --> 00:55:47.510
AND JUST AND SAID, CAN'T THE

00:55:47.577 --> 00:55:49.646
RETAILERS HAVE SORT OF THE FIRST

00:55:49.713 --> 00:55:50.680
RIGHT OF RETRIEVAL, RETRIEVAL,

00:55:50.747 --> 00:55:51.781
RETRIEVAL. AND I THINK I THINK

00:55:51.848 --> 00:55:53.983
YOU, YOU KNOW THIS IN TERMS OF

00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:55.118
YOUR QUESTION. THEY HAVE THAT

00:55:55.185 --> 00:55:56.686
THE QUESTION IS, ARE THEY GOING

00:55:56.753 --> 00:55:58.988
TO GO GET THEIR CART BEFORE THE

00:55:59.055 --> 00:56:00.657
CITY SENDS SOMEBODY OUT TO DO

00:56:00.724 --> 00:56:02.525
THAT OR HAS TO SEND SOMEBODY OUT

00:56:02.592 --> 00:56:04.527
TO DO THAT BECAUSE IT'S BLOCKING

00:56:04.594 --> 00:56:06.062
A WHATEVER, WHATEVER. IT'S

00:56:06.129 --> 00:56:08.531
BLOCKING A RIGHT OF WAY. BUT

00:56:08.598 --> 00:56:11.067
THAT IS THE CASE RIGHT NOW. THE

00:56:11.134 --> 00:56:13.336
LOCAL ORDINANCE, ONE OF THE

00:56:13.403 --> 00:56:14.738
REASONS WE TOOK THAT FIRST

00:56:14.804 --> 00:56:15.972
AMENDMENT IS TO ALLOW IN THE

00:56:16.039 --> 00:56:22.345
LOCAL ORDINANCE IN THAT PROCESS

00:56:22.412 --> 00:56:24.080
FOR A DISCUSSION, A MORE

00:56:24.147 --> 00:56:25.181
ARTICULATED DISCUSSION,

00:56:25.248 --> 00:56:27.717
DEPENDING ON SMALL CITY, LARGE

00:56:27.784 --> 00:56:29.452
CITY, ALL THOSE DIFFERENT THINGS

00:56:29.519 --> 00:56:33.490
WE SEE IN CITIES, WHAT SHOULD BE

00:56:33.556 --> 00:56:36.259
HAPPENING, YOU KNOW, IN TERMS OF

00:56:36.326 --> 00:56:38.828
ANY GRACE PERIOD, FOR EXAMPLE,

00:56:38.895 --> 00:56:40.096
THE CITIES DON'T. THIS BILL IS

00:56:40.163 --> 00:56:41.865
NOT A MANDATE TO CHANGE FROM

00:56:41.931 --> 00:56:43.533
CURRENT STATE LAW. THE CITIES

00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:45.001
DON'T. IF THE CITIES DON'T ADOPT

00:56:45.068 --> 00:56:46.736
AN ORDINANCE, THE DEFAULT IS

00:56:46.803 --> 00:56:48.838
THESE RETAILERS WILL WAIT IF

00:56:48.905 --> 00:56:51.074
THEY DON'T SHOW UP UPON THAT

00:56:51.141 --> 00:56:52.909
INITIAL NOTICE FOR 30 DAYS TO

00:56:52.976 --> 00:56:53.977
GET THEIR CART BACK. THAT CAN'T

00:56:54.043 --> 00:56:56.179
BE. TIME IS MONEY. THAT CAN'T BE

00:56:56.246 --> 00:56:58.214
A GREAT OPTION. AND THE

00:56:58.281 --> 00:56:59.015
INSPIRATION FOR THE BILL IN THE

00:56:59.082 --> 00:57:00.717
FIRST PLACE, YOU KNOW, COMING

00:57:00.784 --> 00:57:03.086
OUT OF SAN JOSE WAS THIS IS NOT

00:57:03.153 --> 00:57:03.720
HELPING ANYBODY. WE'RE TAKING

00:57:03.787 --> 00:57:05.054
CARTS. WE'RE ENDING UP HOLDING

00:57:05.121 --> 00:57:06.956
THEM ON VERY EXPENSIVE PROPERTY

00:57:07.023 --> 00:57:09.425
FOR 30 DAYS, AND NOBODY'S

00:57:09.492 --> 00:57:10.360
GETTING TO USE THEM, RETAILERS

00:57:10.426 --> 00:57:12.262
OR CUSTOMERS OR ANYBODY ELSE. SO

00:57:12.328 --> 00:57:16.366
I'M OPEN TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION

00:57:16.432 --> 00:57:18.201
TO DISCUSSING. AND I HAD ONE OF

00:57:18.268 --> 00:57:19.135
THOSE DISCUSSIONS THIS MORNING.

00:57:19.202 --> 00:57:20.970
I MEAN, IS THERE SOME KIND OF

00:57:21.037 --> 00:57:22.238
CLARIFICATION OR INTENT LANGUAGE

00:57:22.305 --> 00:57:23.339
THAT MAKES WHAT I JUST SAID

00:57:23.406 --> 00:57:27.777
CLEARER THAT YOU THAT THAT IF A

00:57:27.844 --> 00:57:29.746
CITY YOU WANTS TO CARRY EITHER

00:57:29.813 --> 00:57:31.681
BY ZONE OR JUST BY ITS GENERAL

00:57:31.748 --> 00:57:33.917
ORDINANCE, SOME SORT OF A GRACE

00:57:33.983 --> 00:57:34.918
PERIOD, THEY CAN I DON'T THINK

00:57:34.984 --> 00:57:36.586
WE SHOULD BE MANDATING THAT HERE

00:57:36.653 --> 00:57:39.322
IN SACRAMENTO STATEWIDE FOR, YOU

00:57:39.389 --> 00:57:41.124
KNOW, THOUSANDS OF CITIES, LARGE

00:57:41.191 --> 00:57:42.859
AND SMALL, NOT KNOWING EXACTLY

00:57:42.926 --> 00:57:44.194
WHAT THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES ARE.

00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:45.962
OKAY. AND I DON'T THINK WE

00:57:46.029 --> 00:57:48.131
SHOULD BE I JUST WANT TO SAY I'M

00:57:48.198 --> 00:57:49.766
OPEN TO THAT. LIKE I WAS THIS

00:57:49.833 --> 00:57:51.034
MORNING ON THE PHONE CALL, BUT

00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:53.036
I'M, I THINK I THINK A

00:57:53.102 --> 00:57:55.605
NONSTARTER IS THAT THE CITY

00:57:55.672 --> 00:57:56.840
SUBSIDIZE THIS PROCESS BY

00:57:56.906 --> 00:57:59.275
MANDATE OF THE STATE, ANY CITY,

00:57:59.342 --> 00:58:01.911
I JUST SHOULDN'T HAPPEN. OKAY.

00:58:01.978 --> 00:58:04.280
SO IN YOUR RESPONSE, YOU HAD

00:58:04.347 --> 00:58:06.749
SAID THAT ON YOUR AMENDMENTS, I

00:58:06.816 --> 00:58:07.917
THINK THAT YOU HAVE ON YOUR

00:58:07.984 --> 00:58:08.918
TABLE HERE BECAUSE I'M LOOKING

00:58:08.985 --> 00:58:10.720
AT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ON

00:58:10.787 --> 00:58:12.722
PAGE SIX OF OUR ANALYSIS. SO WE

00:58:12.789 --> 00:58:13.890
HAVEN'T YET REALLY NAILED DOWN

00:58:13.957 --> 00:58:14.824
WHETHER OR NOT THERE NEEDS YOU

00:58:14.891 --> 00:58:16.826
SAID A THREE DAY NOTICE TO THE

00:58:16.893 --> 00:58:18.528
RETAILERS, BUT I HAD ALSO HEARD

00:58:18.595 --> 00:58:19.395
DISCUSSION EARLIER 48 HOURS.

00:58:19.462 --> 00:58:20.663
THERE'S ALREADY A THREE DAY

00:58:20.730 --> 00:58:23.233
NOTICE IN STATE LAW BEFORE THIS

00:58:23.299 --> 00:58:26.069
GETS TRIGGERED. RIGHT? RIGHT.

00:58:26.135 --> 00:58:27.637
OKAY. THREE DAYS NOTICE IN STATE

00:58:27.704 --> 00:58:31.975
LAW IF THERE'S AND SO WHAT IS SO

00:58:32.041 --> 00:58:32.909
RELIANT ON STATE LAW. AND SO

00:58:32.976 --> 00:58:34.477
WITH THAT NOTICE BECAUSE THEN

00:58:34.544 --> 00:58:36.145
YOU ARE. THAT'S RIGHT. THEN

00:58:36.212 --> 00:58:36.813
YOU'RE THEN YOU'RE MOTIVATED TO

00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:38.815
SAY OKAY WELL WE GOT 72 HOURS.

00:58:38.882 --> 00:58:40.884
WE HAVE TO GO OUT THERE AND GET

00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:42.051
IT. AND I DON'T WANT TO GET

00:58:42.118 --> 00:58:44.087
FINED. AND TO YOUR POINT,

00:58:44.153 --> 00:58:44.587
ASSEMBLYMEMBER, THAT'S

00:58:44.654 --> 00:58:45.088
ESSENTIALLY THE CURRENT

00:58:45.154 --> 00:58:46.289
FRAMEWORK. AND IT WORKS BECAUSE

00:58:46.356 --> 00:58:47.891
AT THIS POINT, YOU KNOW, THIS

00:58:47.957 --> 00:58:49.125
LAW HAS BEEN IN EFFECT FOR

00:58:49.192 --> 00:58:51.094
ALMOST 40 YEARS. AND SO YOU HAVE

00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:51.928
THIRD PARTY VENDORS WHO

00:58:51.995 --> 00:58:53.062
BASICALLY CONTRACT WITH

00:58:53.129 --> 00:58:53.930
JURISDICTIONS OR CONTRACT WITH

00:58:53.997 --> 00:58:55.064
RETAILERS. AND THEY'RE USUALLY

00:58:55.131 --> 00:58:56.532
LIKE, THEY'RE LIKE SEAL TEAM SIX

00:58:56.599 --> 00:58:57.967
OUT THERE PICKING UP THESE CARTS

00:58:58.034 --> 00:58:59.202
AND BRINGING THEM BACK BY THE

00:58:59.269 --> 00:59:01.671
END OF THE DAY. SO THAT IS

00:59:01.738 --> 00:59:02.272
ESSENTIALLY THAT'S CURRENTLY

00:59:02.338 --> 00:59:04.007
WORKING NOW. EXACTLY. IS THAT

00:59:04.073 --> 00:59:04.807
CHANGE IF THIS BILL GOES INTO

00:59:04.874 --> 00:59:06.643
IT, OR DO WE NEED OTHER

00:59:06.709 --> 00:59:07.410
AMENDMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:59:07.477 --> 00:59:08.778
THAT STEP IS THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

00:59:08.845 --> 00:59:10.546
LOOKING FOR IS ESSENTIALLY

00:59:10.613 --> 00:59:11.414
AMENDMENTS THAT CAN MAINTAIN

00:59:11.481 --> 00:59:12.348
THAT WINDOW. AND THAT

00:59:12.415 --> 00:59:13.650
OPPORTUNITY TO PROCESS IS NOT

00:59:13.716 --> 00:59:16.052
FREE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WITH THE

00:59:16.119 --> 00:59:17.987
IMPLICATION IS WE'VE GOT A

00:59:18.054 --> 00:59:20.089
SITUATION NOW THAT'S FREE UNDER

00:59:20.156 --> 00:59:22.292
THIS CURRENT STATE LAW NOTICE

00:59:22.358 --> 00:59:23.693
PROCESS. AND THE SENATOR WANTS

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:25.762
TO COME IN AND CREATE A REVENUE

00:59:25.828 --> 00:59:27.363
STREAM FOR THE CITIES, FIRST OF

00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:31.034
ALL. THE CITY IS NOT A REVENUE

00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:33.536
IS ARE CHARGING NOW REVENUE

00:59:33.603 --> 00:59:34.570
STREAM. YOU'RE DOING COST

00:59:34.637 --> 00:59:35.405
RECOVERY. YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY

00:59:35.471 --> 00:59:37.206
LIKE PUTTING ANYTHING INTO YOUR

00:59:37.273 --> 00:59:38.408
GENERAL FUND. I GET THAT I I'M

00:59:38.474 --> 00:59:40.243
I'M STILL HAVING A DISCONNECT

00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:41.878
HERE. UNDER EITHER OPTION

00:59:41.945 --> 00:59:43.680
THEY'RE GOING TO PAY. IT'S JUST

00:59:43.746 --> 00:59:45.748
A QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT

00:59:45.815 --> 00:59:47.150
RIGHT. YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE

00:59:47.216 --> 00:59:49.552
PAYING AFTER A 30 DAY IMPOUND OR

00:59:49.619 --> 00:59:51.888
NOT BASICALLY. WHAT'S THAT. AND

00:59:51.955 --> 00:59:53.990
THERE'S SOME VARIATION. WE PUT A

00:59:54.057 --> 00:59:55.792
CAP A DIFFERENT CAP ON. YOU KNOW

00:59:55.858 --> 00:59:57.627
I HEAR THAT EITHER WAY THEY'RE

00:59:57.694 --> 01:00:00.830
GOING TO PAY. OPTION A IS THAT

01:00:00.897 --> 01:00:03.032
UNDER THE EXISTING PROCESS OR

01:00:03.099 --> 01:00:04.734
THE EXISTING PROCESS PLUS THE

01:00:04.801 --> 01:00:06.235
IMPROVEMENTS HERE, THEY STILL

01:00:06.302 --> 01:00:07.737
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO OUT

01:00:07.804 --> 01:00:09.238
THERE AND GET THE ITEM FIRST,

01:00:09.305 --> 01:00:11.274
WHICH IS GOING TO BE THE LEAST

01:00:11.341 --> 01:00:12.775
COSTLY PATH TO RESOLUTION HERE.

01:00:12.842 --> 01:00:15.712
RIGHT? THAT'S RIGHT, SENATOR.

01:00:15.778 --> 01:00:18.014
AND THAT AND THAT IS RETAINED.

01:00:18.081 --> 01:00:21.017
CAN I ASK. YEAH. SO JUST TO

01:00:21.084 --> 01:00:23.453
CLARIFY, UNDER EXISTING LAW, THE

01:00:23.519 --> 01:00:24.787
WAY IT WORKS IN SAN JOSE AND

01:00:24.854 --> 01:00:26.756
OTHER CITIES, THE UNDERLYING

01:00:26.823 --> 01:00:28.057
STATUTE WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS

01:00:28.124 --> 01:00:30.560
IS THAT A CITY RETRIEVES THE

01:00:30.626 --> 01:00:32.895
CARTS, TAKES IT BACK TO HUGE

01:00:32.962 --> 01:00:34.731
IMPOUND YARD, AND THEN THEY

01:00:34.797 --> 01:00:36.032
NOTIFY THE GROCER, AND THE

01:00:36.099 --> 01:00:38.234
GROCER HAS THREE DAYS TO PICK IT

01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:40.536
UP. IF THEY PICK IT UP WITHIN

01:00:40.603 --> 01:00:41.404
THOSE THREE DAYS, THERE'S

01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:43.239
ACTUALLY NO CHARGE. SO IN SAN

01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:45.174
JOSE, IT'S EFFECTIVELY A FREE

01:00:45.241 --> 01:00:47.443
CART RETRIEVAL SERVICE FOR THE

01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:48.444
GROCERIES THAT THEY BRING BACK

01:00:48.511 --> 01:00:50.013
TO THE YARD. WHAT WE'RE TRYING

01:00:50.079 --> 01:00:52.315
TO DO, AND THAT'S NOT WORKING IN

01:00:52.382 --> 01:00:53.282
SAN JOSE, AND THE COUNCILMAN CAN

01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:54.917
ATTEST TO THAT, IS TO TRY TO

01:00:54.984 --> 01:00:56.252
CREATE THE INCENTIVE FOR THE

01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:58.121
GROCER TO MOVE MORE QUICKLY IS

01:00:58.187 --> 01:01:00.089
TO PUT IN PLACE. AND THERE'S TWO

01:01:00.156 --> 01:01:01.691
PATHS. THE BILL SAYS YOU CAN

01:01:01.758 --> 01:01:02.759
STICK WITH EXISTING LAW, AND YOU

01:01:02.825 --> 01:01:04.560
CAN ANY CITY CAN CHOOSE TO SAY,

01:01:04.627 --> 01:01:05.862
WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THEM THE

01:01:05.928 --> 01:01:07.830
THREE DAYS. WE'RE GOING TO PICK

01:01:07.897 --> 01:01:09.665
IT UP FOR FREE. WE'RE NOT GOING

01:01:09.732 --> 01:01:10.533
TO CHARGE THEM ANYTHING. THEY

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:11.701
CAN STILL DO THAT. THE

01:01:11.768 --> 01:01:12.735
AMENDMENTS THAT THE CHAIR AND

01:01:12.802 --> 01:01:14.570
THE CONSULTANT REQUIRED OF THE

01:01:14.637 --> 01:01:15.705
SENATOR, WHICH I THINK WAS A

01:01:15.772 --> 01:01:18.474
GOOD ONE, IS A CITY HAS TO PASS

01:01:18.541 --> 01:01:19.208
AN ORDINANCE AND THE ORDINANCE

01:01:19.275 --> 01:01:20.977
HAS TO CLEARLY BE TRANSPARENT

01:01:21.044 --> 01:01:21.811
AND HOW THEY COME UP WITH THE

01:01:21.878 --> 01:01:24.047
COST RECOVERY FEE. THERE'S ALL

01:01:24.113 --> 01:01:24.580
KINDS OF CONSTITUTIONAL

01:01:24.647 --> 01:01:25.214
PROTECTIONS. THERE'S UNDERLYING

01:01:25.281 --> 01:01:26.783
STATUTES THAT LIMIT HOW MUCH YOU

01:01:26.849 --> 01:01:27.784
CAN ACTUALLY CHARGE. THE $500

01:01:27.850 --> 01:01:29.152
WAS AN AMENDMENT FROM THE CHAIR

01:01:29.218 --> 01:01:30.820
JUST TO SAY THAT THERE IS A

01:01:30.887 --> 01:01:32.822
LIMIT. THE ACTUAL COST WILL BE

01:01:32.889 --> 01:01:33.856
FAR LESS THAN THAT. IT HAS TO BE

01:01:33.923 --> 01:01:35.958
JUSTIFIED. THE GROCERS CAN

01:01:36.025 --> 01:01:36.893
PARTICIPATE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

01:01:36.959 --> 01:01:38.428
NOT EVERY CITY IS GOING TO HAVE

01:01:38.494 --> 01:01:40.096
AN ORDINANCE. SO IT SIMPLY SAYS

01:01:40.163 --> 01:01:41.697
THE CITIES CAN PICK THEM UP AND

01:01:41.764 --> 01:01:43.099
TAKE IT BACK TO THE GROCER AND

01:01:43.166 --> 01:01:46.169
CHARGE A NOMINAL FEE. AND

01:01:46.235 --> 01:01:47.503
LIMITED BY A COST RECOVERY

01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:48.171
MECHANISM. SO THAT'S EFFECTIVELY

01:01:48.237 --> 01:01:50.540
WHAT THE BILL DOES. I HOPE THAT

01:01:50.606 --> 01:01:52.108
HELPS WITH YOUR QUESTION. CAN I

01:01:52.175 --> 01:01:53.676
CAN I JUST MAKE ONE POINT OF

01:01:53.743 --> 01:01:56.646
CLARIFICATION? CAN WE JUST STOP

01:01:56.712 --> 01:01:57.280
GOING BACK AND FORTH? DID THEY

01:01:57.346 --> 01:01:59.515
ANSWER YOUR QUESTION? WELL, I'M

01:01:59.582 --> 01:02:02.418
NOT SURE. OKAY. IS THE ABILITY

01:02:02.485 --> 01:02:04.087
TO HAVE WHETHER IT IS A 48 HOURS

01:02:04.153 --> 01:02:06.255
OR I'M HEARING THIS EXISTING

01:02:06.322 --> 01:02:07.690
THREE DAY NOTICE TO ALLOW THEM

01:02:07.757 --> 01:02:10.193
TO BE ABLE TO GO OUT THERE IN

01:02:10.259 --> 01:02:10.993
THE MOST LEAST COSTLY WAY, BE

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:13.262
ABLE TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE. IS

01:02:13.329 --> 01:02:14.831
THAT STILL ON THE BOOKS? IF THIS

01:02:14.897 --> 01:02:15.932
BILL MAKES IT TO THE GOVERNOR'S

01:02:15.998 --> 01:02:18.367
DESK? YES, BUT IT HAS TO BE. IT

01:02:18.434 --> 01:02:20.069
HAS TO BE NEGOTIATED WITH THE

01:02:20.136 --> 01:02:21.270
ACTUAL ORDINANCE THAT'S ADOPTED.

01:02:21.337 --> 01:02:22.738
BUT IT DOESN'T. IF THAT ENABLES

01:02:22.805 --> 01:02:24.107
AN ORDINANCE AT THE CITY LEVEL,

01:02:24.173 --> 01:02:25.575
I'M SORRY. SORRY IN THAT

01:02:25.641 --> 01:02:27.176
ORDINANCE CAN HAVE THE PROVISION

01:02:27.243 --> 01:02:28.744
IN IT YOU'RE DESCRIBING OR NOT.

01:02:28.811 --> 01:02:30.613
LOCAL CONTROL. THAT PROVISION IS

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.081
CURRENTLY IN STATE LAW. IS THAT

01:02:32.148 --> 01:02:33.883
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING? YES. SO WHY

01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:34.984
DON'T WE JUST RETAIN THAT?

01:02:35.051 --> 01:02:36.052
YOU'VE CAPTURED THIS. THANK YOU,

01:02:36.119 --> 01:02:37.887
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. BECAUSE THAT

01:02:37.954 --> 01:02:38.521
THAT BECAUSE THAT PROVISION IS

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:40.656
TIED TO A 30 DAY IMPOUND. IT'S

01:02:40.723 --> 01:02:41.791
INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE TO TRY TO

01:02:41.858 --> 01:02:44.594
ENCOURAGE THEM TO COME FORWARD

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:46.796
SO THAT TO SAVE THE CITIES A 30

01:02:46.863 --> 01:02:48.464
DAY IMPOUND COST, IT WASN'T A

01:02:48.531 --> 01:02:49.832
GOOD STATUTORY SCHEME IN THE

01:02:49.899 --> 01:02:50.933
FIRST PLACE. IS THE REAL ANSWER

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.136
TO YOUR QUESTION, I WAS ON THE

01:02:53.202 --> 01:02:56.239
FAIR PROTECTION AGAIN, LIKE

01:02:56.305 --> 01:02:57.540
TAXPAYER PROTECTIONS. YOU SAY

01:02:57.607 --> 01:02:59.041
IT'S A FAIR PROTECTION BECAUSE

01:02:59.108 --> 01:02:59.976
IT GIVES THEM THE CHANCE TO BE

01:03:00.042 --> 01:03:01.844
ABLE TO CORRECT THE ISSUE FIRST,

01:03:01.911 --> 01:03:04.447
AND RATHER THAN HAVE TO ALSO

01:03:04.514 --> 01:03:06.449
ASSUME MORE FEES ON TOP OF THAT

01:03:06.516 --> 01:03:07.350
WHEN THEY'RE PROBABLY GETTING

01:03:07.416 --> 01:03:09.652
DAMAGED MATERIAL BACK. THE BEST

01:03:09.719 --> 01:03:11.621
WAY FOR MOST RETAILERS. AND I AM

01:03:11.687 --> 01:03:13.456
ONE, RIGHT? I AM ONE TO THE

01:03:13.523 --> 01:03:14.891
SITUATION. AND YOU'RE WELCOME TO

01:03:14.957 --> 01:03:16.959
SEE IF WE HAVE VIOLATIONS ON OUR

01:03:17.026 --> 01:03:18.794
PROPERTY. WE DON'T FOR THE LAST

01:03:18.861 --> 01:03:20.596
30 YEARS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:03:20.663 --> 01:03:22.632
YOU HAVE THE FOLKS IN PLACE, THE

01:03:22.698 --> 01:03:23.966
SECURITY IN PLACE, THE

01:03:24.033 --> 01:03:25.701
PROVISIONS IN PLACE THAT PEOPLE

01:03:25.768 --> 01:03:26.802
AREN'T WALKING OFF WITH YOUR

01:03:26.869 --> 01:03:28.137
SHOPPING CARTS, OR IF THEY DO

01:03:28.204 --> 01:03:29.572
THAT, YOU GO RETRIEVE THEM

01:03:29.639 --> 01:03:31.274
YOURSELF. THERE'S NO COST IF THE

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:33.209
CITY ISN'T THERE RETRIEVING IT

01:03:33.276 --> 01:03:35.278
FOR YOU. THE QUESTION IS WHETHER

01:03:35.344 --> 01:03:37.380
OR NOT THE TAXPAYERS UP AND DOWN

01:03:37.446 --> 01:03:38.047
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD

01:03:38.114 --> 01:03:40.049
BE SUBSIDIZING RETAILERS FOR THE

01:03:40.116 --> 01:03:41.884
WORK THEY'RE DOING TO GATHER THE

01:03:41.951 --> 01:03:43.819
CART FOR THEM AND SAY, HEY, IT'S

01:03:43.886 --> 01:03:45.855
OVER HERE, COME AND GET IT,

01:03:45.922 --> 01:03:47.823
OKAY? I DON'T, I DON'T I JUST

01:03:47.890 --> 01:03:49.659
I'M SAYING THAT'S I'M JUST BEING

01:03:49.725 --> 01:03:51.727
HONEST WITH YOU AS FAR AS THE

01:03:51.794 --> 01:03:53.362
NEGOTIATIONS GO ON, ANY

01:03:53.429 --> 01:03:55.464
REMAINING AMENDMENTS THAT I'M

01:03:55.531 --> 01:03:57.133
SAYING, I THINK IT'S IT STILL

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:59.802
HAS TO BE A MATTER OF LOCAL

01:03:59.869 --> 01:04:00.903
CONTROL, BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY

01:04:00.970 --> 01:04:02.538
PUT LANGUAGE IN THE BILL. AND I

01:04:02.605 --> 01:04:03.105
DON'T WANT TO NEGOTIATE AND

01:04:03.172 --> 01:04:04.574
NEGOTIATE AMENDMENT IN THIS

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:06.042
COMMITTEE. I'M NOT SURE THE

01:04:06.108 --> 01:04:07.977
CHAIR WOULD WANT ME TO DO THAT,

01:04:08.044 --> 01:04:09.512
BUT WE CAN DO THAT BEFORE

01:04:09.579 --> 01:04:10.680
CONCLUSION OF THIS BILL. INTENT

01:04:10.746 --> 01:04:11.747
LANGUAGE THAT ENCOURAGES THE

01:04:11.814 --> 01:04:12.882
CITIES TO CREATE A GRACE PERIOD

01:04:12.949 --> 01:04:14.617
THAT'S SIMILAR TO THE ONE IN THE

01:04:14.684 --> 01:04:18.187
DEFAULT STATE LAW. I CAN I CAN

01:04:18.254 --> 01:04:19.889
PUT THAT LANGUAGE IN THE BILL,

01:04:19.956 --> 01:04:21.023
BUT THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN

01:04:21.090 --> 01:04:23.025
FORCING THE CITIES TO OKAY, TO

01:04:23.092 --> 01:04:24.660
ACTUALLY SUBSIDIZE THE SENATOR.

01:04:24.727 --> 01:04:25.728
I'VE HEARD EVERYTHING NOW. AND

01:04:25.795 --> 01:04:26.963
JUST TO CONCLUDE THAT I WOULD

01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:30.566
LIKE TO SEE THAT RETAINED IN THE

01:04:30.633 --> 01:04:31.934
CONDITION OF BEING ABLE TO

01:04:32.001 --> 01:04:32.969
IMPLEMENT A NEW STRUCTURE HERE

01:04:33.035 --> 01:04:34.904
AT THE CITY AS WELL, BECAUSE AT

01:04:34.971 --> 01:04:36.339
LEAST THAT GIVES THEM THE RIGHT

01:04:36.405 --> 01:04:38.841
TO BE ABLE TO TRY TO RESOLVE THE

01:04:38.908 --> 01:04:40.209
ISSUE. AND THAT'S ACTUALLY LEAST

01:04:40.276 --> 01:04:41.277
COSTLY ON EVERYBODY IN THE FIRST

01:04:41.344 --> 01:04:43.879
PLACE. AND THEN, YES, THE REST

01:04:43.946 --> 01:04:45.881
OF THIS ALL STARTS TO FLOW AND

01:04:45.948 --> 01:04:47.183
MAKE SENSE. AND I DO THINK THE

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:49.952
CITY HAS A ROLE TO BE ABLE TO

01:04:50.019 --> 01:04:50.753
CODIFY THAT AS WELL, BECAUSE

01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:52.321
WE'RE SETTING THE CONDITIONS FOR

01:04:52.388 --> 01:04:52.822
WHICH THIS ORDINANCE CAN

01:04:52.888 --> 01:04:54.190
ACTUALLY BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE

01:04:54.257 --> 01:04:56.192
FIRST PLACE. I THINK WITHOUT

01:04:56.259 --> 01:04:57.159
THAT, IS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:04:57.226 --> 01:04:58.628
GOING TO ELECT THAT AS TO BE

01:04:58.694 --> 01:05:00.763
ABLE TO ALLOW FOR A WAIVER?

01:05:00.830 --> 01:05:01.797
MAYBE. MAYBE NOT. AND THEN AND

01:05:01.864 --> 01:05:02.999
THEN I THINK THE WHOLE, THE

01:05:03.065 --> 01:05:04.066
WHOLE FAIRNESS ARGUMENT STARTS

01:05:04.133 --> 01:05:05.835
TO FALL APART. SO IF THAT'S YOUR

01:05:05.901 --> 01:05:07.536
COMMITMENT TO BE ABLE TO

01:05:07.603 --> 01:05:08.704
CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT, THAT,

01:05:08.771 --> 01:05:10.706
THAT, THAT, THAT, THAT, THAT

01:05:10.773 --> 01:05:11.874
STRUCTURE, RETAINING THAT

01:05:11.941 --> 01:05:14.477
STRUCTURE TO TRIGGER THIS, THIS

01:05:14.543 --> 01:05:15.378
NEW, THIS NEW STRUCTURE, THIS

01:05:15.444 --> 01:05:17.079
NEW OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CITY,

01:05:17.146 --> 01:05:19.215
THEN THEN I'M THERE WITH YOU.

01:05:19.282 --> 01:05:21.183
BUT BUT IF IT'S NOT, THEN I'M

01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:22.852
NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT

01:05:22.918 --> 01:05:25.321
THE BILL TONIGHT. LOOK, I CAN'T

01:05:25.388 --> 01:05:27.189
I CAN'T TELL YOU. I HAVE

01:05:27.256 --> 01:05:27.990
AGREEMENT WITH SO MANY MEMBERS,

01:05:28.057 --> 01:05:29.825
AS YOU WELL KNOW, FROM

01:05:29.892 --> 01:05:31.560
OPPOSITION. SURE. UNTIL WE HAVE

01:05:31.627 --> 01:05:33.863
SOME LANGUAGE AMENDMENT LANGUAGE

01:05:33.929 --> 01:05:35.665
THAT THEY SIGN OFF ON AND I SIGN

01:05:35.731 --> 01:05:38.100
OFF ON, I HAD A DISCUSSION THIS

01:05:38.167 --> 01:05:38.701
MORNING WITH A REPRESENTATIVE

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:40.603
WHO'S NOT HERE TODAY, WHO

01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:41.637
REPRESENTS SIGNIFICANT RETAIL

01:05:41.704 --> 01:05:43.172
INTERESTS, PROPRIETARY

01:05:43.239 --> 01:05:45.374
INTERESTS, WHO SEEMED FINE WITH

01:05:45.441 --> 01:05:47.410
INTENT, LANGUAGE THAT WOULD

01:05:47.476 --> 01:05:49.679
ENCOURAGE DIRECT IN IN THE

01:05:49.745 --> 01:05:50.880
HEARING AND THE PUBLIC HEARING

01:05:50.946 --> 01:05:52.248
PROCESS AND THE ORDINANCE MAKING

01:05:52.315 --> 01:05:53.916
PROCESS FOR THIS KIND OF A GRACE

01:05:53.983 --> 01:05:55.851
PERIOD TO BE TAKEN UP. IT HAS TO

01:05:55.918 --> 01:05:57.820
BE ON THE TABLE, AS WE WOULD

01:05:57.887 --> 01:06:00.056
SAY. I THINK THAT'S I THINK

01:06:00.122 --> 01:06:01.223
THAT'S AS FAR AS WE'RE GOING TO

01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:03.025
GET. I'M JUST TRYING TO BE

01:06:03.092 --> 01:06:04.860
HONEST. I DON'T THINK, YOU KNOW,

01:06:04.927 --> 01:06:07.296
AN ACTUAL MANDATE OF THE OLD

01:06:07.363 --> 01:06:08.898
STRUCTURE IS GOING TO WORK ONE

01:06:08.964 --> 01:06:10.833
MINUTE. BUT I THINK I THINK WE

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:12.735
HAVE WE HAVE SOME AGREEMENT ON

01:06:12.802 --> 01:06:14.036
THAT. WE JUST NEED TO SEE IN THE

01:06:14.103 --> 01:06:15.905
COMING DAYS IF EVERYBODY WHO'S

01:06:15.971 --> 01:06:16.839
WHOEVER'S IN OPPOSITION AGREES

01:06:16.906 --> 01:06:18.507
TO. THANK YOU, SENATOR. THANK

01:06:18.574 --> 01:06:20.242
YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:21.043
ASSEMBLYMEMBER PACHECO, A

01:06:21.110 --> 01:06:23.212
QUESTION. I'M WORKING ON IT.

01:06:23.279 --> 01:06:27.149
SENATOR PACHECO, THANK YOU. AND

01:06:27.216 --> 01:06:28.684
THIS IS THE SHOPPING CARTS IS

01:06:28.751 --> 01:06:30.152
SOMETHING THAT WE EXPERIENCE IN

01:06:30.219 --> 01:06:31.687
THE CITY OF DOWNEY. AND WHEN I

01:06:31.754 --> 01:06:33.923
WAS ON CITY COUNCIL. SO IT WAS

01:06:33.989 --> 01:06:35.725
ALSO A FRUSTRATION THAT I DEALT

01:06:35.791 --> 01:06:37.159
WITH AND MY COUNCIL COLLEAGUES

01:06:37.226 --> 01:06:39.662
DEALT WITH ON CITY COUNCIL. SO

01:06:39.729 --> 01:06:42.598
WE DEALT WITH AND THIS WAS LIKE

01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:44.367
PROBABLY BEFORE COVID. SO THIS

01:06:44.433 --> 01:06:46.702
WAS SEVERAL YEARS AGO, 2017 OR

01:06:46.769 --> 01:06:48.537
SO. WE WERE DEALING WITH A

01:06:48.604 --> 01:06:49.705
SITUATION WHERE, YOU KNOW,

01:06:49.772 --> 01:06:51.640
PEOPLE WERE STEALING THESE

01:06:51.707 --> 01:06:53.409
SHOPPING CARTS AND THEY WERE

01:06:53.476 --> 01:06:54.577
JUST ABANDONING THEM, ABANDONING

01:06:54.643 --> 01:06:56.178
THEM THROUGHOUT THE CITY. AND SO

01:06:56.245 --> 01:06:58.147
IT WAS CREATING A NUISANCE.

01:06:58.214 --> 01:06:59.215
RESIDENTS WERE COMPLAINING, AND

01:06:59.281 --> 01:07:01.050
SO WE HAD TO START RETRIEVING

01:07:01.117 --> 01:07:03.486
THEM. SO IN DOWNEY ALONE, AND I

01:07:03.552 --> 01:07:05.254
JUST RECENTLY REACHED OUT TO MY

01:07:05.321 --> 01:07:07.490
ASSISTANT CITY MANAGER.

01:07:07.556 --> 01:07:08.557
CURRENTLY, THE CITY IS PAYING

01:07:08.624 --> 01:07:11.394
APPROXIMATELY 16,000 PER YEAR TO

01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:12.862
RETRIEVE THESE SHOPPING CARTS.

01:07:12.928 --> 01:07:15.431
SO IT'S AN ISSUE THAT THAT WE

01:07:15.498 --> 01:07:17.233
HAVE IN MY ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. IN

01:07:17.299 --> 01:07:18.601
FACT, ONE OF MY CITIES DID

01:07:18.667 --> 01:07:20.369
SUBMIT A LETTER OF SUPPORT THE

01:07:20.436 --> 01:07:22.938
CITY OF NORWALK. SO I THINK

01:07:23.005 --> 01:07:24.306
SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE FIGURED

01:07:24.373 --> 01:07:27.610
OUT. I HAD A QUESTION ABOUT THAT

01:07:27.676 --> 01:07:29.011
THREE DAY NOTICE BRINGING IT

01:07:29.078 --> 01:07:32.214
BACK TO THAT. SO WITH RESPECT TO

01:07:32.281 --> 01:07:33.382
THAT THREE DAY NOTICE, ISN'T

01:07:33.449 --> 01:07:36.318
THERE A WAY TO LIKE PUT

01:07:36.385 --> 01:07:37.219
IMPLEMENT THAT, THAT WE WILL

01:07:37.286 --> 01:07:39.121
KEEP THE NOTICE THAT THREE DAY

01:07:39.188 --> 01:07:41.290
NOTICE PERIOD. BUT MAYBE THE

01:07:41.357 --> 01:07:43.292
CITY'S ADOPTED AN ORDINANCE. AND

01:07:43.359 --> 01:07:44.960
IF THEY DON'T SPECIFY SOMETHING

01:07:45.027 --> 01:07:46.095
IN THE ORDINANCE IT SHOULD

01:07:46.162 --> 01:07:47.897
REVERT BACK TO STATE LAW. IS

01:07:47.963 --> 01:07:50.332
THERE IS THAT A POSSIBILITY OR

01:07:50.399 --> 01:07:52.668
WHAT'S THE RATIONALE BEHIND NOT

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:54.570
GIVING SOME KIND OF NOTICE AND

01:07:54.637 --> 01:07:57.306
ALLOWING THE GROCERS TO RETRIEVE

01:07:57.373 --> 01:07:59.175
THEIR THEIR SHOPPING CARTS? I'M

01:07:59.241 --> 01:08:01.710
JUST CURIOUS TO HEAR, YEAH, I

01:08:01.777 --> 01:08:04.947
THINK THE RATIONALE IS REALLY

01:08:05.014 --> 01:08:07.583
PRETTY BASIC. IT'S THAT YOU

01:08:07.650 --> 01:08:09.418
THINK OF A CITY LIKE SAN JOSE

01:08:09.485 --> 01:08:11.120
WITH A 1 MILLION POPULATION, OR

01:08:11.187 --> 01:08:14.723
LOS ANGELES, FOR EXAMPLE. YOU

01:08:14.790 --> 01:08:18.461
KNOW, ESSENTIALLY WE WOULD IF WE

01:08:18.527 --> 01:08:20.496
MANDATE THE THREE DAY NOTICE OR

01:08:20.563 --> 01:08:23.098
CONTINUE TO MANDATE THAT THEY

01:08:23.165 --> 01:08:25.100
MAKE THAT NOTICE TO TRY TO

01:08:25.167 --> 01:08:28.037
ENCOURAGE RETAILERS TO GET THEIR

01:08:28.103 --> 01:08:32.341
ASAP. THAT ITSELF IS A COST AND

01:08:32.408 --> 01:08:33.843
EXPENSE. I MEAN, FIRST OF ALL,

01:08:33.909 --> 01:08:34.910
THEY'VE GOT TO GO OUT THERE.

01:08:34.977 --> 01:08:37.279
THERE IS STATE LAW THAT SAYS

01:08:37.346 --> 01:08:38.614
THAT THE CART HAS TO HAVE, YOU

01:08:38.681 --> 01:08:39.982
KNOW, THE NAME AND THE CONTACT

01:08:40.049 --> 01:08:42.017
ON IT. THEY HAVE TO GO OUT THERE

01:08:42.084 --> 01:08:43.919
AND DO THAT, TAKE THAT

01:08:43.986 --> 01:08:45.054
INVENTORY. RIGHT. SOMEBODY'S GOT

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:46.021
TO DO THAT. IT'S I'M JUST SAYING

01:08:46.088 --> 01:08:47.857
THAT'S JUST NOT A FREE TASK.

01:08:47.923 --> 01:08:49.992
YOU'VE GOT TO DO THAT. AND THEN

01:08:50.059 --> 01:08:51.894
THEY'VE GOT TO COME BACK TO THE

01:08:51.961 --> 01:08:52.862
CITY AND ISSUE A NOTICE, A LEGAL

01:08:52.928 --> 01:08:54.029
NOTICE TO, YOU KNOW, TO THE

01:08:54.096 --> 01:08:59.635
GROCER. YOUR IDENTIFIED CART IS

01:08:59.702 --> 01:09:01.237
OUT HERE. YOU COULD IMAGINE IN A

01:09:01.303 --> 01:09:03.339
BIG CITY, IT SOUNDS LIKE MAYBE

01:09:03.405 --> 01:09:04.707
EVEN IN THE ONE YOU'RE

01:09:04.773 --> 01:09:06.642
DESCRIBING, A MEDIUM SIZED CITY

01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:09.044
OR SMALL CITY THAT'S GOING TO

01:09:09.111 --> 01:09:11.814
ADD UP IN ONE DAY. IN THE CITY

01:09:11.881 --> 01:09:14.149
OF SAN JOSE, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU

01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:17.119
MIGHT BE TALKING 75 OR 100 CARTS

01:09:17.186 --> 01:09:20.322
THAT ARE JUST ROLLED INTO CREEK

01:09:20.389 --> 01:09:22.992
WAYS OR, YOU KNOW, EXPRESSWAYS

01:09:23.058 --> 01:09:24.927
OR WHATEVER. THEY ARE

01:09:24.994 --> 01:09:28.130
INTERCHANGES. AND SO THEY TO

01:09:28.197 --> 01:09:29.732
MANDATE THAT THEY NEED TO GO OUT

01:09:29.798 --> 01:09:33.602
AND DO THAT SO THAT AT THEIR

01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:35.371
COST, AT OUR COST, TAXPAYER

01:09:35.437 --> 01:09:36.872
COSTS, SO THAT THE RETAILER WHO

01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:39.708
OWNS IT, YOU KNOW, CAN GET A

01:09:39.775 --> 01:09:41.110
HALL PASS ENOUGH TO PAY

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:42.278
ANYTHING. IT'S JUST THE

01:09:42.344 --> 01:09:43.312
FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION THERE. OR

01:09:43.379 --> 01:09:45.447
SHOULD THEY BE ENTITLED, LIKE ON

01:09:45.514 --> 01:09:47.816
AN ALMOST EVERY OTHER ORDINANCE

01:09:47.883 --> 01:09:49.418
AND CODE ENFORCEMENT PROVISION,

01:09:49.485 --> 01:09:51.086
THAT WE HAVE A LOCAL GOVERNMENT,

01:09:51.153 --> 01:09:52.555
SHOULD THEY BE ENTITLED TO BASIC

01:09:52.621 --> 01:09:54.156
COST RECOVERY? SO HERE'S HERE'S

01:09:54.223 --> 01:09:56.258
OUR ACTUAL COST WE DON'T WANT

01:09:56.325 --> 01:09:56.892
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO MAKE MONEY

01:09:56.959 --> 01:09:59.128
ON THIS. THIS IS WHAT IT COSTS

01:09:59.194 --> 01:10:00.563
TO SEND, YOU KNOW, EMPLOYEE X

01:10:00.629 --> 01:10:03.866
OUT THERE. IDENTIFY THIS AND PAY

01:10:03.933 --> 01:10:05.067
FOR POSTAGE AND SEND YOU THE

01:10:05.134 --> 01:10:05.901
NOTICE OR WHATEVER THE

01:10:05.968 --> 01:10:07.236
REQUIREMENT IS. ALL THAT'S GOT

01:10:07.303 --> 01:10:09.338
TO BE ARTICULATE. WHAT WE SAID

01:10:09.405 --> 01:10:10.706
IS IT GETS COMPLICATED TO TRY TO

01:10:10.773 --> 01:10:12.441
DO THAT FROM HERE, YOU KNOW,

01:10:12.508 --> 01:10:13.976
WITH SORT OF THE MEAT CLEAVER

01:10:14.043 --> 01:10:16.779
OF, OF LEGISLATION THAT WE

01:10:16.845 --> 01:10:18.914
BELIEVE THAT THE LOCAL ORDINANCE

01:10:18.981 --> 01:10:20.449
NEEDS TO TAKE THAT UP AND THEY

01:10:20.516 --> 01:10:22.051
NEED TO MAKE THAT DECISION. AND

01:10:22.117 --> 01:10:23.953
IT MIGHT NOT BE IT MIGHT NOT

01:10:24.019 --> 01:10:26.021
EVEN BE THE SAME IN A BIG CITY

01:10:26.088 --> 01:10:27.690
FOR EVERY SECTION OF THE CITY.

01:10:27.756 --> 01:10:30.359
AND THEN NEXT QUESTION WOULD BE,

01:10:30.426 --> 01:10:32.661
WHAT IS THE TIME FRAME? AND IN

01:10:32.728 --> 01:10:35.164
SAN JOSE, WHAT IS THE TIME FRAME

01:10:35.230 --> 01:10:38.367
IT TAKES FOR LIKE THE GROCERS TO

01:10:38.434 --> 01:10:40.202
GET THEIR SHOPPING CARTS? WHAT

01:10:40.269 --> 01:10:42.271
IS THE TYPICAL TIME FRAME? HOW

01:10:42.338 --> 01:10:44.239
LONG DOES IT NORMALLY TAKE THEM?

01:10:44.306 --> 01:10:45.941
WE HAVE MR. MULCAHY RESPOND TO

01:10:46.008 --> 01:10:47.109
THAT. HE'S. YEAH. IS THAT ALL

01:10:47.176 --> 01:10:49.878
RIGHT IF I DO THAT, I MEAN, I

01:10:49.945 --> 01:10:51.447
LET ME JUST ANSWER THAT QUESTION

01:10:51.513 --> 01:10:52.481
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY FROM

01:10:52.548 --> 01:10:54.183
THE STANDPOINT OF WHAT SAN

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:57.319
JOSE'S EXPECTATIONS WOULD BE, IS

01:10:57.386 --> 01:10:59.121
THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO CREATE

01:10:59.188 --> 01:11:01.357
SOME ACCOUNTABILITY HERE. WE

01:11:01.423 --> 01:11:03.659
KNOW THAT WE HAVE NATIONAL

01:11:03.726 --> 01:11:05.761
GROCERS IN OUR DISTRICT THAT

01:11:05.828 --> 01:11:07.496
HAVE JUST WRITTEN OFF 40% OF

01:11:07.563 --> 01:11:09.298
THEIR CARTS ON A QUARTERLY

01:11:09.365 --> 01:11:10.699
BASIS, SO THEY'VE SORT OF

01:11:10.766 --> 01:11:12.301
THEY'RE NOT MOTIVATED TO GO OUT

01:11:12.368 --> 01:11:13.969
AND BE PROACTIVE TO RETRIEVE

01:11:14.036 --> 01:11:16.772
THESE CARTS. SO WHAT SAN JOSE IS

01:11:16.839 --> 01:11:18.240
REALLY INTERESTED IN IS CREATING

01:11:18.307 --> 01:11:21.510
THAT TIME PERIOD WHERE WE'RE ALL

01:11:21.577 --> 01:11:23.178
WE'RE HOPING THAT OUR RETAILERS

01:11:23.245 --> 01:11:24.113
WILL BE OUT THERE LOOKING FOR

01:11:24.179 --> 01:11:25.814
CARTS TO THEY MAY HIRE THE SAME

01:11:25.881 --> 01:11:27.616
VENDOR THAT SAN JOSE WILL HIRE

01:11:27.683 --> 01:11:29.518
TO BE OUT DOING THAT SAME THING

01:11:29.585 --> 01:11:30.886
IF THEY GET TO THEM FIRST.

01:11:30.953 --> 01:11:33.322
GREAT. OUR MAIN OBJECTIVE IS

01:11:33.389 --> 01:11:35.324
WHEN WE SEE IT. WE WANT TO KNOW

01:11:35.391 --> 01:11:38.093
THAT WE CAN TAKE ACTION TO PULL

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:38.894
THOSE OUT OF THE CREEKS, TO PULL

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:40.329
THOSE OFF THE SIDEWALK, AND

01:11:40.396 --> 01:11:41.697
THERE'S A SYSTEM IN PLACE TO

01:11:41.764 --> 01:11:43.866
NOTIFY THE RETAILER FOR THEM TO

01:11:43.932 --> 01:11:45.701
COME GET THEM. IF THEY DON'T

01:11:45.768 --> 01:11:46.235
COME GET THEM AND THEY'VE

01:11:46.301 --> 01:11:47.870
WRITTEN THOSE OFF, THERE SHOULD

01:11:47.936 --> 01:11:51.774
BE SOME COST TO THAT RETAILER

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:53.242
FOR HAVING LEFT THOSE FOR THE

01:11:53.308 --> 01:11:55.144
CITY TO DEAL WITH IF THEY COME

01:11:55.210 --> 01:11:57.146
AND GET THEM. I DON'T WANT TO

01:11:57.212 --> 01:11:59.148
HAVE TO FIND THEM. AND I THINK

01:11:59.214 --> 01:12:01.517
THAT THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE ON OUR

01:12:01.583 --> 01:12:03.686
LOCAL ORDINANCE SOME LEEWAY,

01:12:03.752 --> 01:12:05.220
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THE GOAL IS

01:12:05.287 --> 01:12:06.722
TO GET THEM OFF THE STREET, GET

01:12:06.789 --> 01:12:08.524
THEM OFF THE CREEKS, GET THEM

01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:09.124
OUT OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND

01:12:09.191 --> 01:12:10.959
RETURN THEM TO THE RETAILERS.

01:12:11.026 --> 01:12:11.827
THEY DECIDE NOT TO EVER PICK

01:12:11.894 --> 01:12:13.762
THEM UP. SAN JOSE SHOULDN'T BE

01:12:13.829 --> 01:12:15.264
BURYING THE COST OF THAT IN THE

01:12:15.330 --> 01:12:17.866
LONG RUN. SO FROM WHAT I HEAR

01:12:17.933 --> 01:12:20.969
YOU SAY IS YOU ARE IN AGREEMENT

01:12:21.036 --> 01:12:22.838
WITH PROVIDING SOME KIND OF

01:12:22.905 --> 01:12:25.274
NOTICE TO THE RETAILER OR

01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:27.876
GROCER. ABSOLUTELY. AND SO IT

01:12:27.943 --> 01:12:29.244
GOES BACK TO THE ORIGINAL

01:12:29.311 --> 01:12:30.579
QUESTION, HOW LONG DOES IT RIGHT

01:12:30.646 --> 01:12:32.948
NOW TAKE FOR A GROCER OR A

01:12:33.015 --> 01:12:34.550
RETAILER TO PICK UP THEIR

01:12:34.616 --> 01:12:36.852
SHOPPING CARTS? HOW LONG IS THE

01:12:36.919 --> 01:12:37.853
TIME PERIOD FOR THEM TO PICK IT

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:39.621
UP? IT'S INDETERMINATE. THE

01:12:39.688 --> 01:12:41.523
CITY. THE CITY ACTUALLY DOES NOT

01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:43.192
HAVE AN ORDINANCE IN PLACE. AND

01:12:43.258 --> 01:12:44.626
THAT'S A KEY DETAIL THAT WE

01:12:44.693 --> 01:12:45.794
SOMEHOW HAVE NOT MENTIONED IN

01:12:45.861 --> 01:12:48.363
THIS, THAT THE CITY OF SAN JOSE,

01:12:48.430 --> 01:12:49.198
WHICH IS HERE TRYING TO CHANGE

01:12:49.264 --> 01:12:50.566
CURRENT STATE LAW, DOES NOT

01:12:50.632 --> 01:12:52.067
COMPLY WITH CURRENT STATE LAW.

01:12:52.134 --> 01:12:53.035
LET'S STOP THE BACK AND FORTH

01:12:53.102 --> 01:12:54.703
AGAIN. WE'RE ASKING I JUST WANT

01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:56.472
TO KNOW HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE

01:12:56.538 --> 01:13:00.175
RIGHT NOW FOR THE GROCER IF THAT

01:13:00.242 --> 01:13:00.943
INFORMATION IF YOU DON'T HAVE

01:13:01.009 --> 01:13:02.044
THAT INFORMATION THAT'S OKAY.

01:13:02.111 --> 01:13:04.546
BUT I JUST I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW

01:13:04.613 --> 01:13:05.681
HOW LONG DOES IT NORMALLY TAKE

01:13:05.748 --> 01:13:07.082
RIGHT NOW IN THE CITY OF SAN

01:13:07.149 --> 01:13:10.185
JOSE FOR LIKE THE GROCERS OR

01:13:10.252 --> 01:13:12.154
RETAILERS TO OBTAIN BACK THEIR

01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:14.156
SHOPPING CART? APPROXIMATELY. WE

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:15.791
CAN GET YOU THE ANSWER. I DON'T

01:13:15.858 --> 01:13:17.593
KNOW IF WE HAVE I DON'T HAVE

01:13:17.659 --> 01:13:19.528
WITH ME THAT ANSWER TO THAT

01:13:19.595 --> 01:13:20.329
QUESTION. SO THANK YOU FOR

01:13:20.395 --> 01:13:22.331
ANSWERING THE QUESTION. YOU

01:13:22.397 --> 01:13:23.332
DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER. ANYBODY

01:13:23.398 --> 01:13:25.901
ELSE? OKAY, OKAY. I'M GOING TO

01:13:25.968 --> 01:13:27.136
TAKE IT BACK TO EITHER THE

01:13:27.202 --> 01:13:31.440
GROCERS OR THE RETAILERS. SO

01:13:31.507 --> 01:13:33.976
YOU'RE WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO

01:13:34.042 --> 01:13:35.778
SEE IS SOME KIND OF NOTICE TO BE

01:13:35.844 --> 01:13:37.212
PROVIDED SO THAT YOU CAN

01:13:37.279 --> 01:13:37.880
RETRIEVE THE SHOPPING CARTS, OR

01:13:37.946 --> 01:13:39.681
IS IT THAT YOU WOULD PROACTIVELY

01:13:39.748 --> 01:13:41.917
GO OUT AND RETRIEVE THE SHOPPING

01:13:41.984 --> 01:13:43.552
CARTS? BUT WHAT IS THAT WHOLE,

01:13:43.619 --> 01:13:46.488
DO YOU WANT 24 HOUR NOTICE TO BE

01:13:46.555 --> 01:13:49.091
ABLE TO RETRIEVE THEM? YEAH,

01:13:49.158 --> 01:13:50.425
RETRIEVING THEM FROM THE CITY OR

01:13:50.492 --> 01:13:52.394
RETRIEVING THEM FROM THE

01:13:52.461 --> 01:13:54.797
LOCATION OUT IN THE CITY. SO

01:13:54.863 --> 01:13:56.031
CANDIDLY, THAT'S ONE OF THE

01:13:56.098 --> 01:13:57.966
POINTS THAT WE ARE FLEXIBLE ON.

01:13:58.033 --> 01:13:59.835
AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF OUR

01:13:59.902 --> 01:14:01.303
OUR IT'S INTERESTING HEARING

01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:02.805
SOME OF THE POINTS THAT ARE

01:14:02.871 --> 01:14:04.973
BEING MADE HERE OF WHAT WE'D BE

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.375
HAPPY TO DISCUSS THE IMPOUND

01:14:06.442 --> 01:14:07.843
TIME OR THE, THE, YOU KNOW,

01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:08.577
FINED AMOUNTS OR THINGS LIKE

01:14:08.644 --> 01:14:10.546
THAT, BECAUSE WE HAD MULTIPLE

01:14:10.612 --> 01:14:11.113
MEETINGS WITH THIS PIECE OF

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:13.081
PAPER, WE WERE OFFERING THOSE

01:14:13.148 --> 01:14:13.749
KIND OF AMENDMENTS SAYING, HEY,

01:14:13.816 --> 01:14:15.784
IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE 30 DAYS.

01:14:15.851 --> 01:14:16.952
MAYBE IT CAN BE SHORTER, THINGS

01:14:17.019 --> 01:14:18.253
LIKE THAT. SO WE'VE TRIED TO

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:20.055
WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE

01:14:20.122 --> 01:14:20.823
SPONSORS TO ADDRESS THESE

01:14:20.889 --> 01:14:22.157
ISSUES, BUT HAVE JUST NOT HAD

01:14:22.224 --> 01:14:23.992
THE LUCK. BUT I THINK FROM OUR

01:14:24.059 --> 01:14:25.761
PERSPECTIVE, LIKE I JUST

01:14:25.828 --> 01:14:26.695
MENTIONED, FIRST OF ALL, THE

01:14:26.762 --> 01:14:28.664
CITY OF SAN JOSE DOES NOT HAVE A

01:14:28.730 --> 01:14:29.932
CURRENT LAW IN PLACE. SO YOU'RE

01:14:29.998 --> 01:14:30.899
ASKING A QUESTION THAT THEY

01:14:30.966 --> 01:14:33.035
DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER TO BECAUSE

01:14:33.101 --> 01:14:33.936
THEY'RE LIKE, WE DON'T ACTUALLY

01:14:34.002 --> 01:14:34.903
CURRENTLY DO THAT. THEY JUST

01:14:34.970 --> 01:14:36.972
PASSED AN ORDINANCE IN APRIL. I

01:14:37.039 --> 01:14:37.806
BELIEVE THAT WOULD BE ENACTED IN

01:14:37.873 --> 01:14:39.041
JANUARY UNDER CURRENT LAW. BUT

01:14:39.107 --> 01:14:40.175
THEY'RE ESSENTIALLY BETTING THAT

01:14:40.242 --> 01:14:41.977
SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN HERE THIS

01:14:42.044 --> 01:14:43.912
YEAR SO THEY CAN RAISE THE MONEY

01:14:43.979 --> 01:14:45.280
ON IT. RIGHT? SO THEY DON'T THEY

01:14:45.347 --> 01:14:46.548
DON'T CURRENTLY COMPLY WITH

01:14:46.615 --> 01:14:47.783
STATE LAW. I THINK BEYOND THAT,

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:49.251
THOUGH, TO YOUR QUESTION, WE

01:14:49.318 --> 01:14:50.552
WOULD HAPPILY WORK WITH THE

01:14:50.619 --> 01:14:51.820
AUTHOR AND SPONSORS TO KIND OF

01:14:51.887 --> 01:14:53.889
COME UP WITH, WITH, WITH WAYS TO

01:14:53.956 --> 01:14:54.556
TRULY MODERNIZE THIS ORDINANCE.

01:14:54.623 --> 01:14:55.991
RIGHT? LIKE IF IT NEEDS TO GO

01:14:56.058 --> 01:14:58.527
FROM 50 TO $100, THAT'S FINE. IF

01:14:58.594 --> 01:14:59.695
IT NEEDS TO GO FROM 30 DAYS TO

01:14:59.761 --> 01:15:02.664
20 DAYS, SURE, WE CAN HAVE THAT

01:15:02.731 --> 01:15:03.565
CONVERSATION. THE PROBLEM IS WE

01:15:03.632 --> 01:15:04.600
NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO HAVE THAT

01:15:04.666 --> 01:15:06.635
CONVERSATION. AND THIS IS A THIS

01:15:06.702 --> 01:15:07.870
CAME FROM THE SENATE. SO THE

01:15:07.936 --> 01:15:09.037
CONVERSATIONS WEREN'T HELD IN

01:15:09.104 --> 01:15:10.539
THE SENATE. YEAH. WE'VE BEEN

01:15:10.606 --> 01:15:11.707
HAVING CONVERSATIONS SINCE THE

01:15:11.773 --> 01:15:13.475
DAY ONE. A LOT OF WORK HAS GONE

01:15:13.542 --> 01:15:14.543
INTO THIS TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

01:15:14.610 --> 01:15:15.911
WORK. THE STICKING POINT, AS I

01:15:15.978 --> 01:15:18.347
THINK THE LAST POTENTIAL

01:15:18.413 --> 01:15:20.082
AMENDMENT IS WHETHER OR NOT THE

01:15:20.148 --> 01:15:23.752
RETAILERS PAY OR NOT FOR THE

01:15:23.819 --> 01:15:25.520
RETRIEVAL DURING THE FIRST 48

01:15:25.587 --> 01:15:27.689
HOURS AFTER THE NOTICE QUESTION

01:15:27.756 --> 01:15:29.558
THAT SOME OF YOU HAVE BEEN

01:15:29.625 --> 01:15:31.026
ASKING IS ALREADY IN, IT'S

01:15:31.093 --> 01:15:33.562
ALREADY IN THE IT'S ALREADY IN

01:15:33.629 --> 01:15:34.830
THE BILL THERE, THERE ALREADY

01:15:34.897 --> 01:15:36.732
ARE GOING TO RECEIVE NOTICE. THE

01:15:36.798 --> 01:15:38.667
ONLY QUESTION IS DOES, YOU KNOW,

01:15:38.734 --> 01:15:40.669
DO THEY HAVE TO PAY COST

01:15:40.736 --> 01:15:43.238
RECOVERY FOR THIS WORK, WHICH IS

01:15:43.305 --> 01:15:45.274
AKIN TO CODE ENFORCEMENT WORK OR

01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:47.242
NOT? ARE THEY EXEMPTED FROM

01:15:47.309 --> 01:15:49.344
THAT? THAT'S THAT'S REALLY AND

01:15:49.411 --> 01:15:51.380
IN THE EARLIER QUESTION, I WAS

01:15:51.446 --> 01:15:52.648
OPENING THE DOOR TO TRYING TO

01:15:52.714 --> 01:15:54.316
GIVE THE CITIES MORE DIRECTION

01:15:54.383 --> 01:15:56.885
THAT THEY NEED TO AFFIRMATIVELY

01:15:56.952 --> 01:15:58.787
TAKE UP THAT ISSUE EACH TIME

01:15:58.854 --> 01:16:00.956
THEY HAVE AN ORDINANCE. IF I CAN

01:16:01.023 --> 01:16:02.190
JUST SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT, AS

01:16:02.257 --> 01:16:04.860
I WAS A MEMBER OF THE SAN JOSE

01:16:04.927 --> 01:16:06.561
CITY COUNCIL FROM 2001 THROUGH

01:16:06.628 --> 01:16:08.196
2008, THE CITY HAS AN ORDINANCE

01:16:08.263 --> 01:16:09.731
THAT WAS SUPERSEDED BY THIS

01:16:09.798 --> 01:16:11.233
STATE LAW. IT'S STILL ON THE

01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:12.868
BOOKS, BUT IT'S SUPERSEDED BY

01:16:12.935 --> 01:16:14.569
THIS LAW BECAUSE THE STATE CAME

01:16:14.636 --> 01:16:16.338
ALONG AND PREEMPTED THE CITY'S

01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:19.107
LAW, WHICH WAS IN THE EARLY 2000

01:16:19.174 --> 01:16:21.109
WITH THIS 30 DAY IMPOUND PERIOD.

01:16:21.176 --> 01:16:22.344
I THINK PROBABLY WHAT HAPPENED,

01:16:22.411 --> 01:16:23.645
IT'S NOT FAIR TO SPECULATE, IS

01:16:23.712 --> 01:16:25.414
THAT FOLKS IN SACRAMENTO SAID,

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:27.382
LET'S NOT HAVE I DON'T THINK THE

01:16:27.449 --> 01:16:28.784
ORIGINAL QUESTION WAS ANSWERED.

01:16:28.850 --> 01:16:29.985
I WOULD SAY, CAN I ANSWER YOUR

01:16:30.052 --> 01:16:31.820
SO AGAIN, CORRECT. LET'S NOT DO

01:16:31.887 --> 01:16:34.389
THAT. LET'S NOT DO THAT. SO ASK

01:16:34.456 --> 01:16:36.158
THE QUESTION OF HAVE

01:16:36.224 --> 01:16:37.926
CONVERSATIONS BEEN HAD IN THE

01:16:37.993 --> 01:16:40.829
SENATE? CONVERSATIONS HAVE BEEN

01:16:40.896 --> 01:16:42.297
HAPPENING WITH OPPOSITION AS

01:16:42.364 --> 01:16:43.799
RECENTLY AS THIS MORNING AT NO,

01:16:43.865 --> 01:16:46.969
NO, NO IN THE SENATE. THE SENATE

01:16:47.035 --> 01:16:48.637
PROCESS, HAVE YOU HAD

01:16:48.704 --> 01:16:49.871
CONVERSATIONS GETTING YOUR BILL

01:16:49.938 --> 01:16:52.407
TO THE SENATE COMMITTEE? I THINK

01:16:52.474 --> 01:16:53.642
THAT'S YOUR QUESTION. THAT'S MY

01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:54.977
QUESTION. YEAH. THIS IS NOT A

01:16:55.043 --> 01:16:56.378
GUT AND AMEND. WE'VE WORKED THIS

01:16:56.445 --> 01:16:58.480
BILL ALL THE WAY SINCE. YEAH.

01:16:58.547 --> 01:17:00.048
WE'VE TAKEN OKAY. I'LL TAKE IT

01:17:00.115 --> 01:17:02.384
TO THE OPPOSITION. HAVE

01:17:02.451 --> 01:17:04.586
CONVERSATIONS BEEN HAD WITH THE

01:17:04.653 --> 01:17:07.022
SENATOR'S OFFICE SINCE SENATE?

01:17:07.089 --> 01:17:08.190
SINCE IT WAS IN THE SENATE?

01:17:08.256 --> 01:17:10.392
YEAH, FROM WHEN THIS BILL WAS

01:17:10.459 --> 01:17:10.859
INTRODUCED. I'VE HAD

01:17:10.926 --> 01:17:11.893
CONVERSATIONS. RETAILERS HAVE

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:12.828
HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

01:17:12.894 --> 01:17:14.429
SENATOR'S OFFICE. SO WE'VE WE'VE

01:17:14.496 --> 01:17:15.397
BEEN HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS,

01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:17.866
AT LEAST FROM OUR END. AND I

01:17:17.933 --> 01:17:19.768
JUST WANT TO SAY ONE THING THAT

01:17:19.835 --> 01:17:21.136
I WANT TO HEAR FROM. YEAH. NO.

01:17:21.203 --> 01:17:23.372
AND WE HAVE AND I WANT TO

01:17:23.438 --> 01:17:24.172
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. BUT AGAIN, I

01:17:24.239 --> 01:17:25.874
THINK THE FRUSTRATION IS, IS WE

01:17:25.941 --> 01:17:27.676
HEARD THEIR CONCERNS AROUND THE

01:17:27.743 --> 01:17:29.711
COST, THE IMPOUNDMENT, ALL THOSE

01:17:29.778 --> 01:17:31.713
THINGS. AND SO WE TRIED TO COME

01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:32.647
UP WITH PROACTIVE SOLUTIONS. WE

01:17:32.714 --> 01:17:34.549
TRIED TO COME UP WITH LIKE A

01:17:34.616 --> 01:17:35.884
MENU OF POSSIBLE CHANGES. AND

01:17:35.951 --> 01:17:39.621
NEVER WERE WE REALLY GIVEN A

01:17:39.688 --> 01:17:41.356
STRAIGHT RESPONSE TO SOME OF

01:17:41.423 --> 01:17:42.457
THESE SUGGESTIONS. AND SO I

01:17:42.524 --> 01:17:43.992
THINK THAT'S WHERE MOST CITIES

01:17:44.059 --> 01:17:45.060
CAN CHOOSE TO DO WHAT EXACTLY

01:17:45.127 --> 01:17:46.595
WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY, IF THEY

01:17:46.661 --> 01:17:48.163
WANT TO PICK UP THE CARDS AND

01:17:48.230 --> 01:17:49.698
GIVE THEM A NOTICE AND NOT

01:17:49.765 --> 01:17:50.866
CHARGE THEM, THEY CAN DO THAT.

01:17:50.932 --> 01:17:52.267
IF THEY WANT TO PROVIDE THAT

01:17:52.334 --> 01:17:53.902
SERVICE FOR FREE, THEY CAN DO

01:17:53.969 --> 01:17:55.670
THAT IN SAN JOSE. IT'S NOT

01:17:55.737 --> 01:17:56.938
WORKING WITH THIS BILL. DOES IS

01:17:57.005 --> 01:17:58.540
GIVE ONE OPTION. IT ALLOWS THE

01:17:58.607 --> 01:18:00.776
CITY TO GO OUT AND PICK UP A

01:18:00.842 --> 01:18:02.477
CART SO THAT IT'S NOT SITTING

01:18:02.544 --> 01:18:03.645
THERE FOR A WEEK OR MONTH OR

01:18:03.712 --> 01:18:05.013
WHATEVER IT IS, BECAUSE RIGHT

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:06.214
NOW THERE'S NO INCENTIVE. IT'S A

01:18:06.281 --> 01:18:08.250
BUSINESS MODEL NOW BECAUSE THE

01:18:08.316 --> 01:18:09.051
MAXIMUM FINE IS $50. JUST LEAVE

01:18:09.117 --> 01:18:10.919
THE CART, LET THE CITY TAKE CARE

01:18:10.986 --> 01:18:12.587
OF IT. SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:18:12.654 --> 01:18:13.955
CHANGE IS THE CITY CAN GO OUT

01:18:14.022 --> 01:18:16.792
AND PICK UP THE CART, TAKE IT TO

01:18:16.858 --> 01:18:18.527
THE GROCER, DROP IT OFF THEIR

01:18:18.593 --> 01:18:20.062
LOT AND CHARGE THEM WHATEVER IT

01:18:20.128 --> 01:18:21.163
IS $25, $30, $15, WHATEVER IT

01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:23.131
IS, THERE'S A LIMIT ON WHAT WE

01:18:23.198 --> 01:18:25.400
CHARGE. WE WANT TO BE PROACTIVE

01:18:25.467 --> 01:18:25.934
IN THE CITY IN ADDRESSING

01:18:26.001 --> 01:18:26.535
NEIGHBORHOOD BEAUTIFICATION IN

01:18:26.601 --> 01:18:28.236
YOUR COMMUNITY. IF THERE'S NOT

01:18:28.303 --> 01:18:28.904
ENOUGH INCENTIVE, IT PROVIDES A

01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:30.672
TOOL TO SAY, WE'RE GOING TO PICK

01:18:30.739 --> 01:18:31.740
THEM UP AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE

01:18:31.807 --> 01:18:34.109
THEM TO YOU. IT'S NOT $500, IT'S

01:18:34.176 --> 01:18:35.744
A COST. THANK YOU, MR. CRUZ.

01:18:35.811 --> 01:18:36.845
THANK YOU. I'M JUST GOING TO

01:18:36.912 --> 01:18:39.147
MAKE A COMMENT. THIS IS THIS IS

01:18:39.214 --> 01:18:40.382
AN ESSENTIAL TOOL FOR THE

01:18:40.449 --> 01:18:41.817
CITIES. BUT WE NEED TO FIGURE

01:18:41.883 --> 01:18:42.951
THIS OUT. WE NEED TO WORK WITH

01:18:43.018 --> 01:18:44.653
THE OPPOSITION. WE NEED TO WORK

01:18:44.719 --> 01:18:46.254
WORK WITH OUR GROCERS BECAUSE,

01:18:46.321 --> 01:18:46.855
YOU KNOW, THEY ALSO THEY'RE

01:18:46.922 --> 01:18:49.024
VITAL TO OUR COMMUNITIES. AND SO

01:18:49.091 --> 01:18:50.625
WE JUST NEED TO FIGURE THIS OUT.

01:18:50.692 --> 01:18:52.327
AND I AM SUPPORTING YOUR BILL

01:18:52.394 --> 01:18:53.295
TODAY. BUT WE REALLY JUST NEED

01:18:53.361 --> 01:18:55.297
TO FIGURE IT OUT BECAUSE, YOU

01:18:55.363 --> 01:18:57.265
KNOW, WE CAN'T HAVE THE SHOPPING

01:18:57.332 --> 01:18:59.101
CARTS. AND EVERYWHERE IN OUR

01:18:59.167 --> 01:19:01.236
CITIES. AND IT'S JUST SOMETHING

01:19:01.303 --> 01:19:02.737
THAT WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF.

01:19:02.804 --> 01:19:03.972
THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN CARE

01:19:04.039 --> 01:19:06.174
OF PROBABLY A LONG TIME AGO, BUT

01:19:06.241 --> 01:19:07.776
WE REALLY JUST NEED TO FIGURE IT

01:19:07.843 --> 01:19:08.877
OUT. SO I HOPE AND I THINK

01:19:08.944 --> 01:19:10.612
YOU'VE ALREADY COMMITTED,

01:19:10.679 --> 01:19:11.947
SENATOR, TO WORKING WITH THE

01:19:12.013 --> 01:19:14.983
OPPOSITION. SO I'M ASKING YOU TO

01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:16.284
WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION I WILL

01:19:16.351 --> 01:19:18.487
BE SUPPORTING TODAY, AND I'M

01:19:18.553 --> 01:19:19.921
LOOKING FORWARD TO THE FINAL

01:19:19.988 --> 01:19:22.390
OUTCOME. BUT I WILL RESERVE MY

01:19:22.457 --> 01:19:23.758
VOTE FOR THE FLOOR ONCE I SEE

01:19:23.825 --> 01:19:25.727
THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THIS BILL,

01:19:25.794 --> 01:19:27.863
BECAUSE I REALLY WANT US ALL TO,

01:19:27.929 --> 01:19:29.998
LIKE, SIT DOWN AND WORK IT OUT

01:19:30.065 --> 01:19:31.399
AND HAVE MEANINGFUL

01:19:31.466 --> 01:19:33.034
CONVERSATIONS. SO THAT WAY OUR

01:19:33.101 --> 01:19:36.138
CITIES, NGUYEN AND ALSO OUR

01:19:36.204 --> 01:19:38.173
RETAILERS AND OUR GROCERS ALSO

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:40.075
NGUYEN. IT'S GOT TO BE A TRY TO

01:19:40.142 --> 01:19:43.311
SEE HOW WE CAN DO A WIN WIN FOR

01:19:43.378 --> 01:19:44.579
EVERYBODY. AND THAT MEANS

01:19:44.646 --> 01:19:46.314
COMPROMISE. SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN

01:19:46.381 --> 01:19:48.383
ALL SIT DOWN AND WORK TOGETHER.

01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:51.353
THANK YOU. ANYBODY ELSE?

01:19:51.419 --> 01:19:53.121
ASSEMBLYMEMBER RUBIO AND THEN

01:19:53.188 --> 01:19:55.157
STEPHANIE, I'M SORRY, I THOUGHT

01:19:55.223 --> 01:20:01.062
THAT THE WHOLE. COST RECOVERY

01:20:01.129 --> 01:20:03.231
WAS ALREADY SETTLED. I THINK THE

01:20:03.298 --> 01:20:04.499
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, THE ONLY

01:20:04.566 --> 01:20:05.867
POINT OF CONTENTION RIGHT NOW IS

01:20:05.934 --> 01:20:08.036
THE TIME FRAME. I THOUGHT THAT

01:20:08.103 --> 01:20:10.338
THE COST WAS ALREADY PART OF THE

01:20:10.405 --> 01:20:12.774
NEGOTIATION. AM I NOT CORRECT?

01:20:12.841 --> 01:20:15.877
NO. SO TO ANSWER THE QUESTION

01:20:15.944 --> 01:20:16.978
THAT ASSEMBLYMEMBER PACHECO

01:20:17.045 --> 01:20:18.613
ASKED IN TERMS OF WHAT ARE WE

01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:19.614
ULTIMATELY LOOKING FOR HERE,

01:20:19.681 --> 01:20:21.082
IT'S TO MAINTAIN THE ACTUAL

01:20:21.149 --> 01:20:23.618
NOTICE, RIGHT? SO THAT WE ARE

01:20:23.685 --> 01:20:24.186
TOLD BY THESE JURISDICTIONS

01:20:24.252 --> 01:20:25.453
THERE IT'S THE RIGHT OF

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:26.621
RETRIEVAL, RIGHT, WHICH IS

01:20:26.688 --> 01:20:28.089
CURRENTLY 72 HOURS. AND WE'RE

01:20:28.156 --> 01:20:29.191
PREPARED TO KIND OF TALK ABOUT

01:20:29.257 --> 01:20:31.693
THAT. AND IT'S SOME KIND OF CAP

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:33.662
ON COST. AND I THINK COMING

01:20:33.728 --> 01:20:35.597
PRIOR TO THIS HEARING THAT THE

01:20:35.664 --> 01:20:38.099
THERE WAS NO CAP ON COST, RIGHT?

01:20:38.166 --> 01:20:39.935
IT WAS UNLIMITED IN TERMS OF

01:20:40.001 --> 01:20:41.736
WHAT IT IS NOW. I THINK THE $500

01:20:41.803 --> 01:20:43.638
NUMBER IS UNREASONABLE BECAUSE

01:20:43.705 --> 01:20:45.707
FOR LIKE A CITY LIKE SAN JOSE

01:20:45.774 --> 01:20:46.775
THAT HAS APPARENTLY LIKE 2000

01:20:46.841 --> 01:20:47.776
CARTS THEY COLLECT EVERY YEAR,

01:20:47.842 --> 01:20:49.277
THAT'S LIKE $1 MILLION IN

01:20:49.344 --> 01:20:50.645
REVENUE THAT THEY'RE JUST GOING

01:20:50.712 --> 01:20:52.681
TO GET TO SIT ON. SO WE'RE KIND

01:20:52.747 --> 01:20:54.816
OF BACK TO THE CONVERSATION THAT

01:20:54.883 --> 01:20:55.717
THAT ASSEMBLYMEMBER WARD WAS,

01:20:55.784 --> 01:20:58.587
WAS HAVING. WE WANT TO BE

01:20:58.653 --> 01:21:00.722
ACCOUNTABLE. WE WANT TO BE ABLE

01:21:00.789 --> 01:21:02.157
TO RETRIEVE OUR STOLEN PROPERTY.

01:21:02.224 --> 01:21:04.726
AND WE DO THAT. AND SO I THINK

01:21:04.793 --> 01:21:05.994
FOR US, WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO

01:21:06.061 --> 01:21:07.729
MAINTAIN THAT. AND WHAT WE DON'T

01:21:07.796 --> 01:21:09.764
WANT TO DO IS CREATE A NEW

01:21:09.831 --> 01:21:10.699
REVENUE SOURCE FOR LOCAL

01:21:10.765 --> 01:21:11.166
GOVERNMENTS. BECAUSE,

01:21:11.233 --> 01:21:12.734
RESPECTFULLY, I WAS A CHIEF OF

01:21:12.801 --> 01:21:14.569
STAFF TO MAYOR. I KNOW THE

01:21:14.636 --> 01:21:15.804
LEAGUE OF CITIES. YOU GUYS ARE

01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:16.972
GREAT AT PUTTING TOGETHER MODEL

01:21:17.038 --> 01:21:18.006
ORDINANCES, PUSHING OUT EMAIL

01:21:18.073 --> 01:21:18.907
BLASTS, HAVING GREAT

01:21:18.974 --> 01:21:19.841
CONFERENCES, REMEMBER, THIS IS

01:21:19.908 --> 01:21:20.809
GETTING PERSONAL. NO, BUT I

01:21:20.875 --> 01:21:22.310
HAVEN'T BEEN IN A COMMITTEE ROOM

01:21:22.377 --> 01:21:24.112
WHERE AD HOMINEM ATTACKS WERE

01:21:24.179 --> 01:21:25.447
ALLOWED. OKAY. LET'S. OKAY, SO

01:21:25.513 --> 01:21:30.652
THE QUESTION IS SO I THERE IS I

01:21:30.719 --> 01:21:31.753
GUESS LET'S FOCUS ON THE

01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:33.455
QUESTION THAT ASSEMBLYMEMBERS.

01:21:33.521 --> 01:21:34.889
FROM WHAT I HEAR, THERE'S ONE

01:21:34.956 --> 01:21:36.224
MAJOR POINT OF CONTENTION IS

01:21:36.291 --> 01:21:37.959
THAT TIME FRAME, BECAUSE WE ALL

01:21:38.026 --> 01:21:39.094
LOOK I'M GOING TO BRING

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:40.629
CAMPAIGNS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DO

01:21:40.695 --> 01:21:42.163
CAMPAIGN SIGNS AND WE HAVE

01:21:42.230 --> 01:21:43.164
ORDINANCES FOR THAT. WE GET A

01:21:43.231 --> 01:21:44.966
NOTICE AND THEY SAY, IF YOU

01:21:45.033 --> 01:21:46.601
DON'T RETRIEVE IT BY, YOU KNOW,

01:21:46.668 --> 01:21:49.337
IT'S $5 FINE EVERY SINGLE DAY,

01:21:49.404 --> 01:21:51.906
SO IS. BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THE

01:21:51.973 --> 01:21:54.442
COST IS ALREADY BUILT INTO TO

01:21:54.509 --> 01:21:57.312
THIS BILL, AM I CORRECT? WE YES,

01:21:57.379 --> 01:21:58.580
WE HAVE A COST STRUCTURE BUILT

01:21:58.647 --> 01:22:01.616
INTO THE BILL. IT THE BILL

01:22:01.683 --> 01:22:04.419
REQUIRES AN ORDINANCE TO BE

01:22:04.486 --> 01:22:06.755
ENACTED BY THE CITY. BUT I KNOW

01:22:06.821 --> 01:22:08.056
WHAT WE'RE GETTING INTO THE

01:22:08.123 --> 01:22:09.424
ORDINANCE PART, BUT BUT THE COST

01:22:09.491 --> 01:22:11.793
STRUCTURE CAN BE MODIFIED IN THE

01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:13.194
ORDINANCE ITSELF. RIGHT. THESE

01:22:13.261 --> 01:22:15.697
ARE UP TO AMOUNTS. YES, I KNOW I

01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:16.831
UNDERSTAND THAT. THE THING IS

01:22:16.898 --> 01:22:18.366
THAT WHAT WHAT I'M GETTING

01:22:18.433 --> 01:22:19.267
FRUSTRATED OVER IS WE KEEP

01:22:19.334 --> 01:22:20.735
TALKING ABOUT WE SHOULDN'T

01:22:20.802 --> 01:22:22.203
MANDATE THIS, BUT WE SHOULD

01:22:22.270 --> 01:22:23.004
MANDATE THAT. BUT EVERYTHING WE

01:22:23.071 --> 01:22:24.606
DO HERE IS A MANDATE, LIKE

01:22:24.673 --> 01:22:26.474
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN AT

01:22:26.541 --> 01:22:27.942
THIS LEVEL, WE'RE MANDATED FOR

01:22:28.009 --> 01:22:29.611
EVERYBODY. SO IT'S NOT NEWS TO

01:22:29.678 --> 01:22:30.679
ANYBODY THAT ANY BILL THAT

01:22:30.745 --> 01:22:32.447
PASSES THROUGH HERE IS A

01:22:32.514 --> 01:22:34.482
MANDATE. SO SAYING THAT, YOU

01:22:34.549 --> 01:22:35.884
KNOW, THE CITIES CAN, YOU KNOW,

01:22:35.950 --> 01:22:37.986
DO THEIR OWN ORDINANCE. WELL, IF

01:22:38.053 --> 01:22:39.854
THAT WERE THE CASE, THEY COULD

01:22:39.921 --> 01:22:41.089
DO THEIR OWN ORDINANCE FOR

01:22:41.156 --> 01:22:42.691
EVERYTHING. AND THAT IS NOT WHAT

01:22:42.757 --> 01:22:44.759
WE DO HERE. WHAT WE DO HERE IS,

01:22:44.826 --> 01:22:46.161
YOU KNOW, MANDATE FOR THE WHOLE

01:22:46.227 --> 01:22:47.729
ENTIRE STATE. AND I, WE DON'T

01:22:47.796 --> 01:22:48.263
LIKE MANDATES, BUT THAT'S

01:22:48.330 --> 01:22:49.831
ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE DO UP HERE.

01:22:49.898 --> 01:22:52.367
AND SO THAT'S THE PART THAT GETS

01:22:52.434 --> 01:22:53.001
IS GETTING CONVOLUTED HERE. AND

01:22:53.068 --> 01:22:53.702
IT'S GETTING FRUSTRATING

01:22:53.768 --> 01:22:56.037
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IN OTHER

01:22:56.104 --> 01:22:57.038
SITUATIONS WE SAY, OH, WE

01:22:57.105 --> 01:22:57.972
SHOULDN'T MANDATE. WE SHOULD,

01:22:58.039 --> 01:22:59.140
YOU KNOW, DO LOCAL CONTROL.

01:22:59.207 --> 01:23:01.242
EXCEPT FOR, YOU KNOW, WHEN WE

01:23:01.309 --> 01:23:02.377
DON'T DO LOCAL CONTROL AND WE

01:23:02.444 --> 01:23:04.179
MANDATE THINGS. SO WE DO BOTH

01:23:04.245 --> 01:23:05.780
HERE. SO I JUST WANT TO KNOW

01:23:05.847 --> 01:23:07.949
WHAT THE MAJOR POINT OF

01:23:08.016 --> 01:23:09.017
CONTENTION IS FROM. I UNDERSTAND

01:23:09.084 --> 01:23:10.452
IT'S THE TIME FRAME THAT THAT

01:23:10.518 --> 01:23:11.786
THERE'S A NOTICE. AND IF THEY

01:23:11.853 --> 01:23:13.555
DON'T RETRIEVE IT WITHIN THE

01:23:13.621 --> 01:23:15.523
THREE DAYS, THEN THEN THERE'S A

01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:17.892
FINE. AND WHAT I'M HEARING IS

01:23:17.959 --> 01:23:20.428
THAT YOU SAID OR YOU INDICATED

01:23:20.495 --> 01:23:22.464
THAT IT'S ALREADY IF THE

01:23:22.530 --> 01:23:24.733
ORDINANCE IS NOT PASSED, THAT

01:23:24.799 --> 01:23:26.868
IT'S ALREADY IT REVERTS BACK TO

01:23:26.935 --> 01:23:28.737
STATE LAW. WELL THEN WHY? IF IT

01:23:28.803 --> 01:23:30.271
DOES, THEN WHY DON'T WE JUST

01:23:30.338 --> 01:23:32.640
WRITE IT IN THERE? LIKE, WHAT'S

01:23:32.707 --> 01:23:33.308
THE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

01:23:33.375 --> 01:23:34.809
ARGUMENT ABOUT PUTTING IN THE 48

01:23:34.876 --> 01:23:36.811
HOUR OR THE THREE DAYS, WHATEVER

01:23:36.878 --> 01:23:38.046
THE 48 HOURS IN THIS PARTICULAR

01:23:38.113 --> 01:23:40.181
BILL, THAT'S THAT'S A REQUEST BY

01:23:40.248 --> 01:23:41.983
THE OPPOSITION. WE HAVE TAKEN

01:23:42.050 --> 01:23:43.318
AMENDMENTS, COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS

01:23:43.385 --> 01:23:45.453
THAT REQUIRE THE LOCAL

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:46.988
ORDINANCE. SO BUT BY WHAT I'M

01:23:47.055 --> 01:23:48.390
HEARING, THE BILL ORIGINALLY SO

01:23:48.456 --> 01:23:49.824
THAT NO, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE IN

01:23:49.891 --> 01:23:51.826
THIS BILL IS WHAT I'M HEARING.

01:23:51.893 --> 01:23:53.862
WHAT IS NOT GOING TO BE IN THE

01:23:53.928 --> 01:23:55.230
48 HOUR? WE'RE I ASSURED MR.

01:23:55.296 --> 01:23:57.165
WARD WILL CONTINUE TO DISCUSS.

01:23:57.232 --> 01:23:59.667
YES, BUT THE GRACE PERIOD. I,

01:23:59.734 --> 01:24:01.469
SENATOR, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

01:24:01.536 --> 01:24:05.840
THE WE'RE WE'VE DONE THIS A LONG

01:24:05.907 --> 01:24:07.675
TIME AND WE KNOW THAT AT THIS

01:24:07.742 --> 01:24:09.511
POINT WE'RE IN, YOU KNOW, AT THE

01:24:09.577 --> 01:24:12.180
END OF THIS, YOU KNOW, THE BILL

01:24:12.247 --> 01:24:13.448
HEARING. SO THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:24:13.515 --> 01:24:15.450
DO THAT IS TODAY BECAUSE I

01:24:15.517 --> 01:24:17.218
ALREADY KNOW THAT WE CAN YOU

01:24:17.285 --> 01:24:18.653
KNOW, IF WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:20.555
SOMETHING, WE CAN SAY, OH, WELL

01:24:20.622 --> 01:24:22.390
I TRIED AND IT DIDN'T WORK.

01:24:22.457 --> 01:24:23.458
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THESE

01:24:23.525 --> 01:24:24.826
HEARINGS, TO HAVE THESE DEBATES

01:24:24.893 --> 01:24:26.394
HERE, BECAUSE ONCE IT GETS HERE,

01:24:26.461 --> 01:24:28.530
THEN PEOPLE HOPE AND PRAY THAT

01:24:28.596 --> 01:24:29.130
IN THE CORPORATIONS THEY GET

01:24:29.197 --> 01:24:30.598
FIXED. AND IF IT DOESN'T, WE

01:24:30.665 --> 01:24:32.300
HOPE AND PRAY THAT IT HAPPENS ON

01:24:32.367 --> 01:24:34.536
THE FLOOR AND WE CAN RESERVE OUR

01:24:34.602 --> 01:24:35.937
VOTES TO THE FLOOR. BUT WHY NOT

01:24:36.004 --> 01:24:38.173
TAKE CARE OF IT ALREADY SO THAT

01:24:38.239 --> 01:24:40.241
WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THESE

01:24:40.308 --> 01:24:40.842
ARGUMENTS ON THE FLOOR ABOUT,

01:24:40.909 --> 01:24:42.544
YOU KNOW, WHAT YOU COULD HAVE

01:24:42.610 --> 01:24:43.678
DONE OR SHOULD HAVE DONE OR THEY

01:24:43.745 --> 01:24:46.014
DIDN'T. I THINK WE CREATE A LOT

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:46.915
OF OUR OWN PROBLEMS BY NOT

01:24:46.981 --> 01:24:47.949
ADDRESSING THE ISSUES IN

01:24:48.016 --> 01:24:49.050
COMMITTEE. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE

01:24:49.117 --> 01:24:50.552
THE COMMITTEE HEARINGS. AT LEAST

01:24:50.618 --> 01:24:51.820
THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. AND I

01:24:51.886 --> 01:24:53.321
DON'T WANT TO ARGUE ABOUT, YOU

01:24:53.388 --> 01:24:54.556
KNOW, TIME FRAMES. YOU DIDN'T DO

01:24:54.622 --> 01:24:56.324
THIS OR YOU DID. AND THEN WE'RE

01:24:56.391 --> 01:24:58.293
HAVING THIS DEBATE BACK AND

01:24:58.359 --> 01:24:59.394
FORTH OVER, YOU KNOW, WHO'S

01:24:59.461 --> 01:25:00.829
RIGHT. I DON'T WANT TO KNOW

01:25:00.895 --> 01:25:02.163
WHO'S RIGHT. I WANT TO KNOW THAT

01:25:02.230 --> 01:25:03.932
WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS

01:25:03.998 --> 01:25:05.266
ADDRESSING ALL OF THE ISSUES.

01:25:05.333 --> 01:25:06.701
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT CITIES

01:25:06.768 --> 01:25:09.003
HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THE

01:25:09.070 --> 01:25:10.672
ORDINANCES. BUT AGAIN, IT'S TRUE

01:25:10.738 --> 01:25:12.240
WITH EVERYTHING ELSE. WHAT WE'RE

01:25:12.307 --> 01:25:14.509
DOING HERE IS SETTING A

01:25:14.576 --> 01:25:16.344
STRUCTURE FOR THE WHOLE ENTIRE

01:25:16.411 --> 01:25:18.913
STATE. AND THEN IF CITIES WANT

01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:20.415
TO DO ABOVE, YOU KNOW, WHATEVER

01:25:20.482 --> 01:25:22.383
THE ORDINANCE IS, THEN THAT'S

01:25:22.450 --> 01:25:23.918
THAT'S THEIR CHOICE TO YOUR

01:25:23.985 --> 01:25:25.353
POINT THAT THEY HAVE TO OPT IN.

01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:26.955
BUT IF THEY DON'T, WE ALREADY

01:25:27.021 --> 01:25:28.056
ARE LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR

01:25:28.122 --> 01:25:29.791
THEM OR THE FRAMEWORK FOR THEM

01:25:29.858 --> 01:25:30.792
THAT IT'S ALREADY GOING TO

01:25:30.859 --> 01:25:31.793
HAPPEN. SO THAT'S WHERE I'M

01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:33.127
GETTING FRUSTRATED BECAUSE WE'RE

01:25:33.194 --> 01:25:34.729
GOING BACK AND FORTH, AND IT

01:25:34.796 --> 01:25:37.265
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT'S AN

01:25:37.332 --> 01:25:37.866
OUTRAGEOUS REQUEST. YOU KNOW,

01:25:37.932 --> 01:25:39.968
THE MONEY SITUATION. I YOU KNOW,

01:25:40.034 --> 01:25:42.337
I UNDERSTAND THE COST OF

01:25:42.403 --> 01:25:44.072
RECOVERY FOR EVERYTHING. YOU

01:25:44.138 --> 01:25:45.940
KNOW, AGAIN, I MENTIONED THE

01:25:46.007 --> 01:25:47.408
LAWN SIGNS AS AN EXAMPLE. WE ALL

01:25:47.475 --> 01:25:49.110
GET NOTICES. IF WE DON'T PICK

01:25:49.177 --> 01:25:51.246
THEM UP, YOU GET FINED AND

01:25:51.312 --> 01:25:53.014
THAT'S FINE. BUT THE FIRST RIGHT

01:25:53.081 --> 01:25:55.083
OF RECOVERY WHEN YOU CALL, YOU

01:25:55.149 --> 01:25:56.885
KNOW, WHEN I GET A CALL, THEN

01:25:56.951 --> 01:25:58.553
THEY'RE SAYING YOU PICK IT UP.

01:25:58.620 --> 01:26:00.054
IF YOU DON'T, YOU'RE GOING TO

01:26:00.121 --> 01:26:02.524
GET FINED. THAT SHOULD BE THE

01:26:02.590 --> 01:26:03.157
SAME WITH, YOU KNOW, WITH THAT

01:26:03.224 --> 01:26:04.192
THE GROCERS OR WHOEVER, THE

01:26:04.259 --> 01:26:05.693
RETAILERS SHOULD HAVE THE FIRST

01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:07.061
RIGHT OF RECOVERY AND THEN BUT

01:26:07.128 --> 01:26:09.264
RIGHT, THE, THE 48 HOUR RECOVERY

01:26:09.330 --> 01:26:10.832
PERIOD IN THE BILL, I LIKE I

01:26:10.899 --> 01:26:12.800
SAID, IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE JUST

01:26:12.867 --> 01:26:14.002
MAD AT EACH OTHER. WE'RE JUST

01:26:14.068 --> 01:26:15.737
ARGUING FOR THE SAKE OF

01:26:15.803 --> 01:26:16.938
ARGUMENT. AND I DON'T WANT TO DO

01:26:17.005 --> 01:26:18.840
THAT. I WANT US TO. THE WHOLE

01:26:18.907 --> 01:26:20.041
PURPOSE OF THIS COMMITTEE IS TO

01:26:20.108 --> 01:26:22.343
TRY AND FIGURE THIS OUT SO THAT

01:26:22.410 --> 01:26:24.012
WE DON'T HAVE TO GO INTO, YOU

01:26:24.078 --> 01:26:25.246
KNOW, THE APPROPRIATIONS OR THE

01:26:25.313 --> 01:26:26.648
FLOOR AND GET THIS WHOLE

01:26:26.714 --> 01:26:27.849
CONVERSATION. AND SO, AGAIN, TO

01:26:27.916 --> 01:26:30.852
ME, IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM LIKE AN

01:26:30.919 --> 01:26:31.753
UNREASONABLE REQUEST THAT'S, YOU

01:26:31.819 --> 01:26:34.122
KNOW, THAT'S MY OPINION, RIGHT?

01:26:34.188 --> 01:26:36.991
HEY, I CAME IN HERE, TOLD THAT I

01:26:37.058 --> 01:26:38.393
NEEDED TO ACCEPT COMMITTEE

01:26:38.459 --> 01:26:42.397
AMENDMENTS. WE'VE ACCEPTED THE

01:26:42.463 --> 01:26:43.865
COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. YOU HAVE.

01:26:43.932 --> 01:26:47.001
IT SOUNDS LIKE AD HOC INDIVIDUAL

01:26:47.068 --> 01:26:48.202
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MIGHT

01:26:48.269 --> 01:26:51.739
BE ASKING OFF THE DAIS TO STOP

01:26:51.806 --> 01:26:52.941
RECESS OR SOMETHING AND TRY TO

01:26:53.007 --> 01:26:55.009
WRITE THE LEGAL LANGUAGE FOR AN

01:26:55.076 --> 01:26:56.077
ADDITIONAL AMENDMENT. I DON'T

01:26:56.144 --> 01:26:57.946
UNDERSTAND THAT. I'M A LITTLE

01:26:58.012 --> 01:26:59.314
CONFUSED. IT'S NOT IT'S NOT

01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:01.015
TYPICALLY DONE. SO LET ME JUST

01:27:01.082 --> 01:27:02.517
KNOW. OBVIOUSLY, THAT WOULD HAVE

01:27:02.584 --> 01:27:06.187
TO BE. MY COMMENTS. THANK YOU

01:27:06.254 --> 01:27:06.888
FOR ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE

01:27:06.955 --> 01:27:09.057
AMENDMENTS. APPRECIATE THAT. AND

01:27:09.123 --> 01:27:10.458
I BELIEVE THAT THERE'S STILL AN

01:27:10.525 --> 01:27:11.492
OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE WITH

01:27:11.559 --> 01:27:14.362
THOSE CONVERSATIONS. AS IT WAS

01:27:14.429 --> 01:27:16.598
STATED, WE ALL RESERVE THE RIGHT

01:27:16.664 --> 01:27:18.533
TO ACT DIFFERENTLY ON THE FLOOR.

01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:20.134
WHEN THE BILL COMES OUT, IT GETS

01:27:20.201 --> 01:27:22.403
OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE. YES. NOW,

01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:24.672
WHEN EVERY CITY, OBVIOUSLY ALL

01:27:24.739 --> 01:27:25.673
COMMUNITIES HAVE THIS ISSUE,

01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:28.076
WHICH IS NOT SOMETHING NEW,

01:27:28.142 --> 01:27:32.080
EVERY CITY ALSO HAS MECHANISMS

01:27:32.146 --> 01:27:33.247
TO RETRIEVE THOSE SHOPPING CARTS

01:27:33.314 --> 01:27:34.949
PUTTING IN ON THE RETAILER, THE

01:27:35.016 --> 01:27:36.784
STORE OWNER, WHOEVER IT IS, A

01:27:36.851 --> 01:27:38.419
PHARMACY. AND THOSE ARE

01:27:38.486 --> 01:27:39.621
TYPICALLY DONE THROUGH THE

01:27:39.687 --> 01:27:42.056
ENTITLEMENT PROCESS. SO WITH IF

01:27:42.123 --> 01:27:43.625
IT'S A CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT,

01:27:43.691 --> 01:27:45.727
THERE ARE CONDITIONS IN THAT

01:27:45.793 --> 01:27:47.195
APPROVAL IN THAT LAND USE

01:27:47.261 --> 01:27:48.529
ENTITLEMENT. ONE OF THOSE

01:27:48.596 --> 01:27:49.631
CONDITIONS IS THAT THERE SHOULD

01:27:49.697 --> 01:27:51.833
BE A SHOPPING CART RETRIEVAL

01:27:51.899 --> 01:27:56.537
PLAN. THAT'S TYPICAL. SO IF THE

01:27:56.604 --> 01:27:58.640
STORE, A SUPERMARKET, A

01:27:58.706 --> 01:28:00.174
PHARMACY, ANYBODY THAT PROVIDES

01:28:00.241 --> 01:28:01.943
SHOPPING CART FOR THEIR

01:28:02.010 --> 01:28:02.744
CUSTOMERS, THEY HAVE TO COMPLY

01:28:02.810 --> 01:28:04.112
WITH THOSE CONDITIONS OF

01:28:04.178 --> 01:28:06.681
APPROVAL. IF THEY DON'T, THEN

01:28:06.748 --> 01:28:09.183
THAT ENTITLEMENT CAN GO BACK FOR

01:28:09.250 --> 01:28:10.652
REVIEW AT THE COUNCIL LEVEL OR

01:28:10.718 --> 01:28:12.153
AT THE PLANNING COMMISSION

01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:14.155
LEVEL. THERE IS A RISK OF

01:28:14.222 --> 01:28:16.190
PULLING THAT ENTITLEMENT. THAT'S

01:28:16.257 --> 01:28:18.059
NOT SOMETHING THAT ANYBODY

01:28:18.126 --> 01:28:19.160
WANTS. THE CITIES DON'T WANT

01:28:19.227 --> 01:28:21.062
THAT. RESIDENTS DON'T WANT THAT,

01:28:21.129 --> 01:28:23.164
WANT TO BE ABLE TO GO DO OUR

01:28:23.231 --> 01:28:24.866
SHOPPING. CITIES DON'T WANT TO

01:28:24.932 --> 01:28:25.667
DO THAT EITHER, BECAUSE THAT'S A

01:28:25.733 --> 01:28:27.468
FORM OF TAX REVENUE FOR THEM.

01:28:27.535 --> 01:28:28.636
OBVIOUSLY, THE INDUSTRY DOES NOT

01:28:28.703 --> 01:28:30.505
WANT TO DO THAT EITHER. SO TO

01:28:30.571 --> 01:28:32.473
ADDRESS THE DRASTIC SOLUTION,

01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:35.009
WHEN THESE THINGS HAPPEN, CITIES

01:28:35.076 --> 01:28:36.711
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE IT

01:28:36.778 --> 01:28:38.946
BACK FOR REVIEW. THAT'S A LOSE

01:28:39.013 --> 01:28:40.948
LOSE FOR EVERYBODY. IT'S ALREADY

01:28:41.015 --> 01:28:42.650
BEEN STATED THAT IT'S AN ISSUE

01:28:42.717 --> 01:28:44.952
ACROSS THE STATE. CITIES ALREADY

01:28:45.019 --> 01:28:48.189
HAVE THAT MECHANISM IN PLACE. IF

01:28:48.256 --> 01:28:50.858
A CITY HIRES A THIRD PARTY

01:28:50.925 --> 01:28:52.393
PROGRAM TO HIRE SOMEBODY TO GO

01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:53.828
PICK HIM UP, THAT'S IN THE

01:28:53.895 --> 01:28:55.730
BENEFIT OF EVERYBODY. THE CITIES

01:28:55.797 --> 01:28:57.465
HAVE THEIR STREETS CLEAN.

01:28:57.532 --> 01:29:00.768
THERE'S NO ISSUES WITH THAT. THE

01:29:00.835 --> 01:29:01.602
GROCERS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:03.938
RETRIEVE THOSE CARS, AND THEY'RE

01:29:04.005 --> 01:29:04.706
COMPLYING WITH THEIR C.U.P WITH

01:29:04.772 --> 01:29:07.141
THE CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL,

01:29:07.208 --> 01:29:08.276
STRIKING THAT BALANCE AGAIN,

01:29:08.342 --> 01:29:10.044
WHATEVER THE COST ASSOCIATED IS

01:29:10.111 --> 01:29:13.314
FOR CITIES THAT HAVE TO DO THAT,

01:29:13.381 --> 01:29:13.915
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO PROVIDE

01:29:13.981 --> 01:29:14.515
THAT SAFETY AND APPEARANCE OF

01:29:14.582 --> 01:29:16.617
THEIR CITIES. IT'S A FAIR, FAIR

01:29:16.684 --> 01:29:18.252
ASSESSMENT. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:29:18.319 --> 01:29:19.187
TRYING TO VALUE HERE. TO YOUR

01:29:19.253 --> 01:29:20.488
QUESTION ON ACCEPTING THE

01:29:20.555 --> 01:29:21.522
COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS, THOSE ARE

01:29:21.589 --> 01:29:23.391
AMENDMENTS THAT WE ASK YOU TO

01:29:23.458 --> 01:29:25.460
ACCEPT, AND YOU HAVE DONE SO TO

01:29:25.526 --> 01:29:27.929
ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF YOU.

01:29:27.995 --> 01:29:29.797
KEEP WORKING ON THIS

01:29:29.864 --> 01:29:31.132
CONVERSATION WITH BOTH SIDES.

01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:32.867
THAT'S STILL POSSIBLE, RIGHT?

01:29:32.934 --> 01:29:34.969
YES. BUT WE'RE HERE TO REVIEW

01:29:35.036 --> 01:29:36.771
THE PROPOSAL IN FRONT OF US WITH

01:29:36.838 --> 01:29:37.839
THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT

01:29:37.905 --> 01:29:38.873
YOU'VE ACCEPTED. YES. BUT AGAIN,

01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:40.942
I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT

01:29:41.008 --> 01:29:43.111
THE MECHANISM IS ALREADY IN

01:29:43.177 --> 01:29:44.846
PLACE FOR THOSE THAT VIOLATE

01:29:44.912 --> 01:29:46.347
THEIR CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL BY

01:29:46.414 --> 01:29:48.182
NOT RETRIEVING THOSE SHOPPING

01:29:48.249 --> 01:29:49.584
CARTS, BY HAVING A SHOPPING CART

01:29:49.650 --> 01:29:51.052
RETRIEVAL PLAN. THAT'S THE

01:29:51.119 --> 01:29:52.553
BOTTOM LINE. AGAIN, CITIES DON'T

01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:54.522
WANT TO DO THAT. THAT'S THE

01:29:54.589 --> 01:29:56.891
WORST POSSIBLE WAY TO SOLVE THE

01:29:56.958 --> 01:29:58.860
ISSUE. NOBODY WANTS TO DO THAT.

01:29:58.926 --> 01:30:00.795
BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT ASSEMBLY

01:30:00.862 --> 01:30:02.430
MEMBER STEPHANIE HAD SOME

01:30:02.497 --> 01:30:05.700
COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU

01:30:05.767 --> 01:30:07.168
CHAIR. MY COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS

01:30:07.235 --> 01:30:09.337
HAVE CHANGED QUITE A BIT SINCE I

01:30:09.403 --> 01:30:12.173
ENTERED. SO FIRST OF ALL, I WANT

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:13.741
TO THANK SENATOR CORTEZ FOR

01:30:13.808 --> 01:30:15.510
ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS AND I

01:30:15.576 --> 01:30:18.212
WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE CONCERNS

01:30:18.279 --> 01:30:20.882
THAT WERE EXPRESSED BY ASSEMBLY

01:30:20.948 --> 01:30:22.016
MEMBER WARD. IN TERMS OF THE

01:30:22.083 --> 01:30:24.018
RIGHT OF RETRIEVAL. I WILL BE

01:30:24.085 --> 01:30:26.988
SUPPORTING THIS TODAY WITH THE

01:30:27.054 --> 01:30:29.524
HOPE THAT THESE ISSUES THAT HAVE

01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:31.025
BEEN BROUGHT UP CAN CONTINUE TO

01:30:31.092 --> 01:30:32.727
BE WORKED ON WITH THE GROCERS

01:30:32.794 --> 01:30:34.529
AND THE RETAILERS, AND IT SOUNDS

01:30:34.595 --> 01:30:35.730
LIKE WE HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO DO

01:30:35.797 --> 01:30:37.331
THAT OUTSIDE OF THIS COMMITTEE,

01:30:37.398 --> 01:30:38.432
INAPPROPES OR ON THE FLOOR. SO

01:30:38.499 --> 01:30:40.868
AMENDMENTS CAN BE MADE. AND I DO

01:30:40.935 --> 01:30:42.537
WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE YOU. I'M

01:30:42.603 --> 01:30:44.071
PROBABLY THE ONLY ONE HERE ON

01:30:44.138 --> 01:30:44.872
THIS PANEL THAT HAS ACTUALLY

01:30:44.939 --> 01:30:47.375
WORKED FOR THE CITY OF SAN JOSE

01:30:47.441 --> 01:30:49.677
IN 2006, WHEN YOU WERE ON THE

01:30:49.744 --> 01:30:50.545
COUNCIL. I WORKED FOR VICE MAYOR

01:30:50.611 --> 01:30:52.847
CINDY CHAVEZ AT THE TIME, SO I

01:30:52.914 --> 01:30:53.447
HAD THE BENEFIT OF ACTUALLY

01:30:53.514 --> 01:30:55.349
WORKING IN SAN JOSE AND THEN

01:30:55.416 --> 01:30:56.851
CONTRAST THAT WITH THEN WORKING

01:30:56.918 --> 01:30:59.353
IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN

01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:01.689
FRANCISCO FOR 17.9 YEARS AS A

01:31:01.756 --> 01:31:02.223
LEGISLATIVE AIDE AND AS A

01:31:02.290 --> 01:31:03.691
SUPERVISOR ON THE BOARD OF

01:31:03.758 --> 01:31:05.526
SUPERVISORS. AND I RAISE THAT

01:31:05.593 --> 01:31:07.328
BECAUSE EACH CITY IS DIFFERENT,

01:31:07.395 --> 01:31:09.363
AND EACH CITY IS GOING TO HAVE A

01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:11.299
DIFFERENT SOLUTION TO THIS

01:31:11.365 --> 01:31:13.634
PROBLEM, IT IS A PROBLEM. AS

01:31:13.701 --> 01:31:16.070
ASSEMBLY MEMBER PACHECO

01:31:16.137 --> 01:31:17.705
EXPRESSED, WHAT HOW IT AFFECTS

01:31:17.772 --> 01:31:19.340
DOWNEY. SO EACH CITY IS GOING TO

01:31:19.407 --> 01:31:21.876
BE ABLE TO CRAFT A SOLUTION TO

01:31:21.943 --> 01:31:24.111
THIS PROBLEM. AND I, I RECOGNIZE

01:31:24.178 --> 01:31:25.079
THAT IN THE BILL, AND I THANK

01:31:25.146 --> 01:31:27.481
YOU FOR AMENDING IT TO MAKE IT

01:31:27.548 --> 01:31:28.816
OPTIONAL FOR CITIES TO EVEN

01:31:28.883 --> 01:31:31.452
ENGAGE IN A RETRIEVAL PROCESS AT

01:31:31.519 --> 01:31:33.254
ALL. SO, YOU KNOW, LIKE I SAID,

01:31:33.321 --> 01:31:34.689
SAN FRANCISCO IS VERY DIFFERENT.

01:31:34.755 --> 01:31:36.257
WE HAVE A DIFFERENT DYNAMIC. WE

01:31:36.324 --> 01:31:37.859
HAVE FOOD SECURITY ISSUES. WE

01:31:37.925 --> 01:31:40.127
HAVE GROCERY STORES CLOSING DOWN

01:31:40.194 --> 01:31:42.163
IN AREAS WHERE IT'S VERY

01:31:42.230 --> 01:31:43.965
DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO GET TO A

01:31:44.031 --> 01:31:45.600
GROCERY STORE, AND FOR SAN

01:31:45.666 --> 01:31:47.001
FRANCISCO TO MAKE IT MORE

01:31:47.068 --> 01:31:48.035
DIFFICULT ON GROCERS. I DON'T

01:31:48.102 --> 01:31:49.804
THINK THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS

01:31:49.871 --> 01:31:51.038
WOULD ENGAGE IN SOMETHING LIKE

01:31:51.105 --> 01:31:53.040
THAT. I KNOW THAT I PROBABLY

01:31:53.107 --> 01:31:53.774
WOULDN'T ON THE BOARD BECAUSE

01:31:53.841 --> 01:31:54.876
IT'S SO EXPENSIVE ANYWAY TO

01:31:54.942 --> 01:31:56.477
OPERATE A BUSINESS IN SAN

01:31:56.544 --> 01:31:58.379
FRANCISCO. SO I KNOW THAT MY

01:31:58.446 --> 01:31:59.580
LOCALITY PROBABLY WILL NOT

01:31:59.647 --> 01:32:01.315
ENGAGE IN THE SAME TYPE OF

01:32:01.382 --> 01:32:03.117
MECHANISM THAT THE CITY OF SAN

01:32:03.184 --> 01:32:04.619
JOSE WILL AND I, AND I RESPECT

01:32:04.685 --> 01:32:06.687
THAT. WE ARE ALL DIFFERENT. WE

01:32:06.754 --> 01:32:07.855
COME FROM DIFFERENT AREAS. SO I

01:32:07.922 --> 01:32:09.724
WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY WITH

01:32:09.790 --> 01:32:11.459
THE UNDERSTANDING THERE ARE SOME

01:32:11.525 --> 01:32:12.293
OUTSTANDING ISSUES THAT HAVE

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:14.729
BEEN ARTICULATED BY MANY ON THIS

01:32:14.795 --> 01:32:16.497
PANEL, AND I'M HOPING THAT MAYBE

01:32:16.564 --> 01:32:18.199
COOLER MINDS CAN PREVAIL AND WE

01:32:18.266 --> 01:32:20.067
CAN, YOU KNOW, RETREAT FROM THIS

01:32:20.134 --> 01:32:22.603
AND GO BACK AND REALLY TRY TO

01:32:22.670 --> 01:32:24.038
COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT WE

01:32:24.105 --> 01:32:27.008
CAN ALL SUPPORT. SO THANK YOU.

01:32:27.074 --> 01:32:28.242
THANK YOU, SENATOR STEPHANIE.

01:32:28.309 --> 01:32:29.644
ASSEMBLYMEMBER RANSOM, I'M GOING

01:32:29.710 --> 01:32:31.712
TO BE REALLY BRIEF AND TRY NOT

01:32:31.779 --> 01:32:33.080
TO BE REDUNDANT. I THINK I'M

01:32:33.147 --> 01:32:34.882
WONDERING WHAT THE CONCERN IS

01:32:34.949 --> 01:32:37.285
ABOUT AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD

01:32:37.351 --> 01:32:39.287
PROVIDE A NOTICE. SO I COME FROM

01:32:39.353 --> 01:32:41.422
A CITY WHERE ON MY CITY COUNCIL,

01:32:41.489 --> 01:32:44.258
WHAT WE DID WAS WE DID HAVE A

01:32:44.325 --> 01:32:45.826
THE CITY WOULD, YOU KNOW,

01:32:45.893 --> 01:32:47.461
CONTACT PEOPLE, GIVE THEM AN

01:32:47.528 --> 01:32:49.263
OPPORTUNITY. AND I WANT TO MAKE

01:32:49.330 --> 01:32:51.265
SURE THAT WE ARE BEING MINDFUL

01:32:51.332 --> 01:32:52.700
THAT THESE SHOPPING CARTS ARE

01:32:52.767 --> 01:32:54.402
NOT LEAVING BECAUSE THE STORES

01:32:54.468 --> 01:32:56.370
ARE TAKING THESE SHOPPING CARTS

01:32:56.437 --> 01:32:58.205
IN OUR COMMUNITY. IT WOULD BE

01:32:58.272 --> 01:32:59.407
HOMELESS FOLKS AND THEY WOULD

01:32:59.473 --> 01:33:01.008
TAKE THE CARTS. AND SOMETIMES

01:33:01.075 --> 01:33:02.910
WHEN THE WHEN YOU FOUND THE

01:33:02.977 --> 01:33:03.911
CONDITION THAT MAYBE THE GROCER

01:33:03.978 --> 01:33:05.246
DOESN'T WANT THE CART BACK,

01:33:05.313 --> 01:33:06.480
RIGHT. BECAUSE MAYBE IT'S

01:33:06.547 --> 01:33:07.949
SOMETHING IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE TO

01:33:08.015 --> 01:33:10.151
TAKE IT BACK. IN THAT CASE,

01:33:10.217 --> 01:33:11.686
SOMEBODY NEEDS TO DEAL WITH THE

01:33:11.752 --> 01:33:12.853
NUISANCE. BUT I DO FEEL THAT IT

01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:14.622
IS IMPORTANT, ESPECIALLY WHEN

01:33:14.689 --> 01:33:15.923
WE'RE DEALING WITH BUSINESSES.

01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:17.224
THIS THIS IS NOT HAPPENING

01:33:17.291 --> 01:33:18.726
BECAUSE OF THEIR NEGLIGENCE OR

01:33:18.793 --> 01:33:19.894
NUISANCE. THIS IS HAPPENING

01:33:19.961 --> 01:33:20.995
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE TAKING THE

01:33:21.062 --> 01:33:22.396
SHOPPING CARTS OFF OF THE

01:33:22.463 --> 01:33:23.764
PROPERTY. AND I DON'T THINK THAT

01:33:23.831 --> 01:33:28.502
IT IS FAIR TO ALLOW A CITY TO

01:33:28.569 --> 01:33:30.271
IMPOSE SOMETHING WITHOUT GIVING

01:33:30.338 --> 01:33:32.440
THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO RETRIEVE

01:33:32.506 --> 01:33:34.008
WHAT'S ACTUALLY STOLEN PROPERTY.

01:33:34.075 --> 01:33:37.445
AND SO I HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE

01:33:37.511 --> 01:33:40.748
INABILITY OR THE REFUSAL TO

01:33:40.815 --> 01:33:42.450
ACCEPT GIVING A NOTICE. AND THAT

01:33:42.516 --> 01:33:43.784
IS A CONCERN FOR ME, BECAUSE I

01:33:43.851 --> 01:33:45.886
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

01:33:45.953 --> 01:33:46.854
CRAFTING LEGISLATION THAT IS

01:33:46.921 --> 01:33:48.122
FAIR TO ALL INVOLVED. SO I JUST

01:33:48.189 --> 01:33:50.591
WANTED TO GO ON RECORD WITH

01:33:50.658 --> 01:33:51.826
THAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SEE,

01:33:51.892 --> 01:33:53.227
NOBODY ELSE IN THE COMMITTEE

01:33:53.294 --> 01:33:54.428
WITH QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. IS

01:33:54.495 --> 01:33:57.665
THERE A MOTION TO MOVE THE BILL?

01:33:57.732 --> 01:34:00.067
IS THERE A SECOND, SECOND?

01:34:00.134 --> 01:34:01.535
FIRST? IN A SECOND. WOULD YOU

01:34:01.602 --> 01:34:03.838
LIKE TO CLOSE, SENATOR? YES.

01:34:03.904 --> 01:34:06.374
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. CHAIR.

01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:07.008
AND I WON'T, YOU KNOW, ENGAGE

01:34:07.074 --> 01:34:09.543
IN, YOU KNOW, FURTHER ROBUST

01:34:09.610 --> 01:34:11.479
DISCUSSION IN MY CLOSE. BUT, YOU

01:34:11.545 --> 01:34:12.713
KNOW, I JUST AGAIN WANT TO

01:34:12.780 --> 01:34:15.149
REPEAT THAT THERE. THE

01:34:15.216 --> 01:34:17.018
GOVERNMENT ALREADY IS INVOLVED

01:34:17.084 --> 01:34:20.955
IN REQUIRING THAT THESE CARTS BE

01:34:21.022 --> 01:34:22.790
RETRIEVED OR THERE'S

01:34:22.857 --> 01:34:24.792
CONSEQUENCES FOR THAT. ALL LAID

01:34:24.859 --> 01:34:27.795
OUT IN STATE STATUTE. IT'S NOT

01:34:27.862 --> 01:34:30.031
SOMETHING NEW. WE'RE NOT, YOU

01:34:30.097 --> 01:34:32.266
KNOW, JUST TO DECIDE TO WAKE UP

01:34:32.333 --> 01:34:34.068
ONE MORNING IN JANUARY AND COME

01:34:34.135 --> 01:34:35.836
AFTER BUSINESSES. THERE'S A

01:34:35.903 --> 01:34:37.805
COUPLE OF US UP HERE TESTIFYING

01:34:37.872 --> 01:34:43.778
WHO HAVE EXTENSIVE, EXTENSIVE

01:34:43.844 --> 01:34:46.514
EXPERIENCE WITH RETAIL AT BOTH

01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:48.482
THE PROPERTY OWNER STANDPOINT

01:34:48.549 --> 01:34:51.652
AND THE RETAILER STANDPOINT. SO

01:34:51.719 --> 01:34:54.188
I WOULD SUPPOSE BEYOND SOME OF

01:34:54.255 --> 01:34:55.322
THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE TESTING

01:34:55.389 --> 01:34:56.957
IN OPPOSITION. BUT WE COULD HAVE

01:34:57.024 --> 01:34:59.160
FURTHER DISCUSSIONS. THE BOTTOM

01:34:59.226 --> 01:35:01.996
LINE IS WE WILL CONTINUE TO TRY

01:35:02.063 --> 01:35:03.297
TO CLOSE THIS GAP ABOUT WHETHER

01:35:03.364 --> 01:35:05.299
A 48 HOUR NOTICE SHOULD BE

01:35:05.366 --> 01:35:06.934
SHOULD BE FREE, SHOULD BE NOT

01:35:07.001 --> 01:35:10.504
FREE AS A MATTER OF STATE LAW OR

01:35:10.571 --> 01:35:13.107
SHOULD BE, YOU KNOW, TAKEN UP BY

01:35:13.174 --> 01:35:14.842
THE LOCALS, WHICH IS THE WAY WE

01:35:14.909 --> 01:35:17.078
HAVE IT NOW. AND YOU HAVE MY

01:35:17.144 --> 01:35:17.845
COMMITMENT THAT WE'LL KEEP

01:35:17.912 --> 01:35:20.047
WORKING ON THAT. I THINK WE'VE

01:35:20.114 --> 01:35:20.714
BEEN WORKING ON THIS BILL BACK

01:35:20.781 --> 01:35:22.316
AND FORTH WITH VARIOUS

01:35:22.383 --> 01:35:23.551
REPRESENTATIVES OF OPPOSITION,

01:35:23.617 --> 01:35:24.652
LITERALLY ON A DAILY BASIS,

01:35:24.718 --> 01:35:26.587
RIGHT UP TO THIS MORNING. SO

01:35:26.654 --> 01:35:27.888
WE'LL KEEP DOING THAT. AND WE

01:35:27.955 --> 01:35:29.490
WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR CONFIDENCE

01:35:29.557 --> 01:35:32.460
IN US TO GET THAT DONE. AND I'D

01:35:32.526 --> 01:35:34.395
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

01:35:34.462 --> 01:35:35.496
THANK YOU, SENATOR, THANK YOU

01:35:35.563 --> 01:35:36.897
FOR PRESENTING YOUR BILL TODAY.

01:35:36.964 --> 01:35:38.099
THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH THE

01:35:38.165 --> 01:35:38.933
COMMITTEE TO PLACE SOME

01:35:38.999 --> 01:35:41.102
GUARDRAILS ON HOW MUCH CAN BE

01:35:41.168 --> 01:35:42.069
CHARGED TO RETAILERS, INCLUDING

01:35:42.136 --> 01:35:44.004
A CAP ON THE ACTUAL COST, WHICH

01:35:44.071 --> 01:35:46.941
WAS ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS. WHILE

01:35:47.007 --> 01:35:48.075
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE

01:35:48.142 --> 01:35:49.243
EXISTING PROCESS FOR SHOPPING

01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:50.845
CART RETRIEVAL IS SUFFICIENT, I

01:35:50.911 --> 01:35:53.280
AM SYMPATHETIC TO THE CONCERNS

01:35:53.347 --> 01:35:54.048
OF THE RETAILERS AS I'VE

01:35:54.115 --> 01:35:55.316
EXPRESSED IT. PLEASE CONTINUE TO

01:35:55.382 --> 01:35:56.383
WORK RETAILERS, WHICH YOU'VE

01:35:56.450 --> 01:35:58.285
AGREED ON, AND WITH THE

01:35:58.352 --> 01:35:59.520
AMENDMENTS, I WILL BE VOTING

01:35:59.587 --> 01:36:01.722

01:36:01.789 --> 01:36:03.224

SOUTH THANK YOU CHAIR. MOVING ON

01:36:37.424 --> 01:36:39.126
TO ITEM NUMBER TWO ON THE AGENDA

01:36:39.193 --> 01:36:42.029
SB 445 BY SENATOR WIENER.

01:36:42.096 --> 01:36:56.010
SENATOR, WHEN YOU'RE READY.

01:36:56.076 --> 01:36:56.911
WHEN YOU'RE READY, SENATOR.

01:36:56.977 --> 01:36:59.947
THANK YOU. THANK YOU, MISTER

01:37:00.014 --> 01:37:00.781
CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES, I THINK

01:37:00.848 --> 01:37:02.183
WE'RE GOING TO SWITCH OUT

01:37:02.249 --> 01:37:05.019
SHOPPING CARTS FOR TRAINS TODAY,

01:37:05.085 --> 01:37:07.188
IF THAT'S OKAY. NOTHING AGAINST

01:37:07.254 --> 01:37:10.624
SHOPPING CARTS. THEY'RE VERY

01:37:10.691 --> 01:37:12.693
IMPORTANT. COLLEAGUES, I'M HERE

01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:15.729
TO PRESENT SENATE BILL 445,

01:37:15.796 --> 01:37:20.801
WHICH IS FOCUSED ON MOVING HIGH

01:37:20.868 --> 01:37:23.771
SPEED RAIL ALONG MORE

01:37:23.837 --> 01:37:25.606
EXPEDITIOUSLY BY TRYING TO

01:37:25.673 --> 01:37:28.175
EXPEDITE THIRD PARTY PERMITS AND

01:37:28.242 --> 01:37:31.545
PERMISSIONS THAT ARE SO

01:37:31.612 --> 01:37:32.813
ESSENTIAL FOR THIS PROJECT,

01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:36.383
BEING ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD. I

01:37:36.450 --> 01:37:38.285
WANT TO SAY WHEN THIS BILL FIRST

01:37:38.352 --> 01:37:39.587
STARTED, IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT

01:37:39.653 --> 01:37:40.921
BILL. THE BILL I INTRODUCED

01:37:40.988 --> 01:37:43.324
EARLIER IN THE YEAR APPLIED TO

01:37:43.390 --> 01:37:47.194
ALL TRANSIT SYSTEMS, ANY KIND OF

01:37:47.261 --> 01:37:50.798
MULTI-JURISDICTIONAL RAIL OR BUS

01:37:50.864 --> 01:37:52.366
LINE THAT WOULD REQUIRE PERMITS

01:37:52.433 --> 01:37:54.301
FROM CITIES OR UTILITIES,

01:37:54.368 --> 01:37:56.737
TELECOMS, CABLE COMPANIES, ETC.

01:37:56.804 --> 01:37:58.806
AND IT PUT A 30 DAY SHOT CLOCK

01:37:58.872 --> 01:37:59.940
ON THOSE PERMITS. I THOUGHT IT

01:38:00.007 --> 01:38:01.875
WAS A GREAT IDEA. NOT EVERYONE

01:38:01.942 --> 01:38:04.178
THOUGHT IT WAS A GREAT IDEA. SO

01:38:04.245 --> 01:38:06.247
WE HIT THE PAUSE ON THAT AND

01:38:06.313 --> 01:38:07.681
AGREED TO WORK, CONTINUE TO WORK

01:38:07.748 --> 01:38:09.216
WITH THE SENATE COMMITTEES AND

01:38:09.283 --> 01:38:11.719
WITH THE THREE ASSEMBLY

01:38:11.785 --> 01:38:14.221
COMMITTEES ON A GOOD APPROACH.

01:38:14.288 --> 01:38:16.690
AND WE ONCE IT GOT OVER TO THE

01:38:16.757 --> 01:38:17.691
ASSEMBLY, WE TOOK A DIFFERENT

01:38:17.758 --> 01:38:18.792
APPROACH, WHICH IS THE APPROACH

01:38:18.859 --> 01:38:20.628
IN THE BILL, WHICH IS ABOUT

01:38:20.694 --> 01:38:21.962
REQUIRING EARLY ENGAGEMENT FROM

01:38:22.029 --> 01:38:23.998
HIGH SPEED RAIL, REQUIRING HIGH

01:38:24.064 --> 01:38:26.367
SPEED RAIL TO ISSUE REGULATIONS

01:38:26.433 --> 01:38:27.768
THAT SET STRUCTURE AROUND THESE

01:38:27.835 --> 01:38:29.703
THIRD PARTY, THIS TYPE OF THIRD

01:38:29.770 --> 01:38:32.172
PARTY ENGAGEMENT AND ADOPT A

01:38:32.239 --> 01:38:34.475
MODEL OF BINDING ARBITRATION

01:38:34.541 --> 01:38:37.177
WHEN THERE ARE DISPUTES, SO THAT

01:38:37.244 --> 01:38:40.180
DECISIONS CAN BE MADE QUICKLY.

01:38:40.247 --> 01:38:41.548
AND WE LIMITED THE BILL ONLY TO

01:38:41.615 --> 01:38:43.484
HIGH SPEED RAIL. I AM INTERESTED

01:38:43.550 --> 01:38:45.352
IN THE FUTURE ON WORKING ON A

01:38:45.419 --> 01:38:46.887
BROADER TRANSIT APPROACH,

01:38:46.954 --> 01:38:49.089
BECAUSE OTHER TRANSIT SYSTEMS DO

01:38:49.156 --> 01:38:50.524
EXPERIENCE THESE PROBLEMS, BUT

01:38:50.591 --> 01:38:52.693
HIGH SPEED RAIL IS TIME

01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:54.561
SENSITIVE BECAUSE WE KNOW IT'S

01:38:54.628 --> 01:38:57.264
BEEN IN THE NEWS A LOT, AND

01:38:57.331 --> 01:38:58.065
FRANKLY, IT'S BEEN A REAL BLACK

01:38:58.132 --> 01:39:00.467
EYE FOR CALIFORNIA. THE PROJECT,

01:39:00.534 --> 01:39:02.336
WHICH CONTINUES TO HAVE VOTER

01:39:02.403 --> 01:39:03.570
SUPPORT, ACCORDING TO THE

01:39:03.637 --> 01:39:05.606
POLLING, HAS MOVED ALONG SO

01:39:05.673 --> 01:39:07.941
SLOWLY. WE NEED TO GET THIS DONE

01:39:08.008 --> 01:39:09.243
FOR THE FUTURE OF THE STATE, BUT

01:39:09.310 --> 01:39:11.078
ALSO TO SHOW THAT WE CAN DELIVER

01:39:11.145 --> 01:39:12.813
LARGE PROJECTS. AND I WANT TO

01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:15.416
JUST BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THIS

01:39:15.482 --> 01:39:17.985
BILL, THE PERIOD OF TIME WHEN

01:39:18.052 --> 01:39:20.087
THIS BILL GOES INTO EFFECT FOR

01:39:20.154 --> 01:39:22.423
HIGH SPEED RAIL AND WHEN IT USED

01:39:22.489 --> 01:39:23.757
TO INCLUDE OTHER PROJECTS. THIS

01:39:23.824 --> 01:39:27.328
IS ABOUT WHEN WE AS A STATE HAVE

01:39:27.394 --> 01:39:29.163
DECIDED THAT WE ARE GOING TO DO

01:39:29.229 --> 01:39:32.299
A PROJECT AND WE'VE APPROVED THE

01:39:32.366 --> 01:39:34.134
FORMAL APPROVALS ENVIRONMENTAL

01:39:34.201 --> 01:39:36.670
CLEARANCE UNDER SEQUA, THE

01:39:36.737 --> 01:39:38.272
FUNDING, OR AT LEAST PARTIAL

01:39:38.339 --> 01:39:39.940
FUNDING WHEN WE WHEN WE HAVE

01:39:40.007 --> 01:39:41.675
DECIDED WE'RE DOING A PROJECT,

01:39:41.742 --> 01:39:43.777
IN THIS CASE HIGH SPEED RAIL AND

01:39:43.844 --> 01:39:45.946
PROVIDED FUNDING FOR IT, ARE WE

01:39:46.013 --> 01:39:49.550
GOING TO ALLOW 100 DIFFERENT

01:39:49.616 --> 01:39:51.318
ENTITIES TO BE ABLE TO VETO IT?

01:39:51.385 --> 01:39:53.120
BECAUSE THAT'S A SYSTEM WE HAVE

01:39:53.187 --> 01:39:55.689
RIGHT NOW WHERE ANY CITY OR

01:39:55.756 --> 01:39:58.225
WATER DISTRICT OR SPECIAL

01:39:58.292 --> 01:39:59.993
DISTRICT THAT WERE SOME SORT OF

01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:02.229
ENCROACHMENT PERMIT IS REQUIRED,

01:40:02.296 --> 01:40:04.631
OR A UTILITY OR TELECOM THAT MAY

01:40:04.698 --> 01:40:07.267
BE A WIRE HAS TO BE MOVED OR

01:40:07.334 --> 01:40:08.235
SOME SORT OF INFRASTRUCTURE

01:40:08.302 --> 01:40:10.070
CHANGE HAS TO BE MADE. WE

01:40:10.137 --> 01:40:12.106
EFFECTIVELY GIVE THEM A VETO

01:40:12.172 --> 01:40:14.141
BECAUSE THEY CAN JUST NOT

01:40:14.208 --> 01:40:16.543
RESPOND OR DRAG THEIR FEET,

01:40:16.610 --> 01:40:18.345
SOMETIMES FOR GOOD REASON. MAYBE

01:40:18.412 --> 01:40:20.147
THEY'RE THEY HAVE GOOD REASONS,

01:40:20.214 --> 01:40:22.082
SOMETIMES NOT GOOD REASONS. AND

01:40:22.149 --> 01:40:23.617
THERE IS NOTHING THAT IN THIS

01:40:23.684 --> 01:40:25.486
CASE HIGH SPEED RAIL CAN DO

01:40:25.552 --> 01:40:28.455
ABOUT IT. AND IT'S NOT THE ONLY

01:40:28.522 --> 01:40:29.757
REASON WHY HIGH SPEED RAIL HAS

01:40:29.823 --> 01:40:31.792
BEEN SLOWED DOWN, BUT IT IS

01:40:31.859 --> 01:40:33.460
ABSOLUTELY ONE OF THE REASONS.

01:40:33.527 --> 01:40:34.628
ACCORDING TO THE INSPECTOR

01:40:34.695 --> 01:40:37.231
GENERAL REPORT THAT CAME OUT

01:40:37.297 --> 01:40:39.600
EARLIER THIS YEAR. SO,

01:40:39.666 --> 01:40:41.001
COLLEAGUES, THIS IS A GOOD BILL

01:40:41.068 --> 01:40:42.836
WORTHY OF SUPPORT. IF THE BILL

01:40:42.903 --> 01:40:43.871
PASSES OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE, WE

01:40:43.937 --> 01:40:46.173
WILL BE GOING THIS AFTERNOON TO

01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:47.541
THE UTILITIES AND ENERGY

01:40:47.608 --> 01:40:48.976
COMMITTEE HAVING SIMULTANEOUS

01:40:49.042 --> 01:40:50.444
HEARINGS. I'VE NEVER HAD THAT

01:40:50.511 --> 01:40:51.812
BEFORE, BUT I DIDN'T REALIZE

01:40:51.879 --> 01:40:53.347
THAT WAS A THING. BUT APPARENTLY

01:40:53.414 --> 01:40:55.115
IT IS FROM TIME TO TIME AND IN

01:40:55.182 --> 01:40:56.850
UTILITIES AND ENERGY, WE'VE

01:40:56.917 --> 01:40:59.219
AGREED WITH THE CHAIR AND

01:40:59.286 --> 01:41:00.187
CONSULTATION WITH CHAIR WILSON

01:41:00.254 --> 01:41:02.623
AND CHAIR CARRILLO THAT WE WILL

01:41:02.689 --> 01:41:06.193
BE. WE'VE ALREADY REMOVED THE

01:41:06.260 --> 01:41:09.530
IOUS FROM THE MANDATORY BINDING

01:41:09.596 --> 01:41:11.265
REGULATION ARBITRATION PIECE,

01:41:11.331 --> 01:41:13.500
AND WE'LL BE ALSO CLASSIFYING

01:41:13.567 --> 01:41:15.836
OTHER UTILITIES LIKE PWS IN THE

01:41:15.903 --> 01:41:17.504
SAME PUBLIC OWNED UTILITIES IN

01:41:17.571 --> 01:41:21.074
THE SAME CATEGORY. WE ALSO HAVE,

01:41:21.141 --> 01:41:22.609
AND I'M GRATEFUL THAT ALL THREE

01:41:22.676 --> 01:41:24.511
CHAIRS AND BOTH SENATE CHAIRS

01:41:24.578 --> 01:41:26.480
HAVE AGREED THAT OVER THE

01:41:26.547 --> 01:41:27.748
SUMMER, WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON

01:41:27.815 --> 01:41:29.983
THIS TO REALLY CONSTRUCT THE

01:41:30.050 --> 01:41:32.152
BEST POSSIBLE BILL TO TRY TO

01:41:32.219 --> 01:41:34.221
MOVE THIS PROJECT FORWARD IN A

01:41:34.288 --> 01:41:35.489
WAY THAT'S FAIR TO ALL

01:41:35.556 --> 01:41:36.824
STAKEHOLDERS, BUT THAT ALSO

01:41:36.890 --> 01:41:37.758
UNDERSTANDS THAT WE HAVE TO ALL

01:41:37.825 --> 01:41:40.427
BE WE NEED TO ALL BE ROWING IN

01:41:40.494 --> 01:41:42.262
THE SAME DIRECTION WHEN IT COMES

01:41:42.329 --> 01:41:42.896
TO HIGH SPEED RAIL. AND SO I'M

01:41:42.963 --> 01:41:44.598
GRATEFUL TO ALL THE

01:41:44.665 --> 01:41:45.265
COLLABORATION, AND I

01:41:45.332 --> 01:41:47.334
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

01:41:47.401 --> 01:41:49.069
WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IS

01:41:49.136 --> 01:41:51.605
KEITH DUNN WITH THE BUILDING AND

01:41:51.672 --> 01:41:54.408
CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL AND

01:41:54.475 --> 01:41:56.543
MARK VUKOVICH WITH STREETS FOR

01:41:56.610 --> 01:42:00.180
ALL. GOOD. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR

01:42:00.247 --> 01:42:01.748
AND MEMBERS MARK STREETS FOR

01:42:01.815 --> 01:42:03.550
ALL. SB 445 DIRECTLY ADDRESSES

01:42:03.617 --> 01:42:04.952
ONE OF THE MOST PERSISTENT AND

01:42:05.018 --> 01:42:06.854
COSTLY PROBLEMS AFFECTING PUBLIC

01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:07.921
INFRASTRUCTURE. THIRD PARTY

01:42:07.988 --> 01:42:09.523
PERMITTING DELAYS. UNTIL TODAY,

01:42:09.590 --> 01:42:11.325
THE PROCESS FOR SECURING PERMITS

01:42:11.391 --> 01:42:12.893
AND APPROVALS FROM UTILITIES AND

01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:13.827
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND OTHER

01:42:13.894 --> 01:42:15.662
THIRD PARTIES IS FRAGMENTED,

01:42:15.729 --> 01:42:17.564
INCONSISTENT AND ONEROUS. THESE

01:42:17.631 --> 01:42:19.333
THIRD PARTIES, SOME PUBLIC, SOME

01:42:19.399 --> 01:42:20.434
PRIVATE, ARE ESSENTIAL FOR THE

01:42:20.501 --> 01:42:22.102
DELIVERY OF PROJECTS LIKE HIGH

01:42:22.169 --> 01:42:23.904
SPEED RAIL. YET OFTENTIMES THEY

01:42:23.971 --> 01:42:25.739
FACE NO STATUTORY DEADLINES AND,

01:42:25.806 --> 01:42:26.907
MOST IMPORTANTLY, LITTLE

01:42:26.974 --> 01:42:28.308
INCENTIVE TO ACT QUICKLY. THAT

01:42:28.375 --> 01:42:30.577
MEANS MULTIYEAR DELAYS FOR

01:42:30.644 --> 01:42:32.079
SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS REVIEWING

01:42:32.145 --> 01:42:34.047
A RELOCATION PLAN OR SIGNING OFF

01:42:34.114 --> 01:42:36.350
ON A DESIGN. THIS ISN'T AN ISSUE

01:42:36.416 --> 01:42:38.285
UNIQUE TO HIGH SPEED RAIL. IT'S

01:42:38.352 --> 01:42:39.520
SYSTEMIC. IN LA METRO, FOR

01:42:39.586 --> 01:42:41.288
EXAMPLE, HAS FOUND THAT GETTING

01:42:41.355 --> 01:42:42.022
PERMITS AND CLEARANCES FROM

01:42:42.089 --> 01:42:43.891
OTHER AGENTS AGENCIES OFTEN ADDS

01:42:43.957 --> 01:42:45.692
12 TO 18 MONTHS FOR PROJECT

01:42:45.759 --> 01:42:47.294
TIMELINES. AND EVEN THIS CAN.

01:42:47.361 --> 01:42:48.962
THIS CAN EVEN APPLY TO SOME OF

01:42:49.029 --> 01:42:50.297
THE MOST MODEST PEDESTRIAN AND

01:42:50.364 --> 01:42:51.665
BIKE SAFETY INFRASTRUCTURE

01:42:51.732 --> 01:42:53.500
PROJECTS. THESE DELAYS ARE

01:42:53.567 --> 01:42:54.801
EXPENSIVE AND DEEPLY

01:42:54.868 --> 01:42:56.403
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. EACH MONTH OF

01:42:56.470 --> 01:42:57.771
DELAYS, INCREASES LABOR AND

01:42:57.838 --> 01:42:59.640
MATERIAL COSTS, INFLATES PROJECT

01:42:59.706 --> 01:43:00.774
BUDGETS, AND DIMINISHES THE

01:43:00.841 --> 01:43:02.109
RETURN ON PUBLIC INVESTMENTS.

01:43:02.175 --> 01:43:03.310
MOST IMPORTANTLY, THESE

01:43:03.377 --> 01:43:04.177
BOTTLENECKS DELAY THE PUBLIC

01:43:04.244 --> 01:43:05.846
BENEFIT FOR TAXPAYERS THAT THE

01:43:05.913 --> 01:43:06.813
TAXPAYERS ARE DEMANDING OF THE

01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:08.715
STATE BY REQUIRING HIGH SPEED

01:43:08.782 --> 01:43:11.084
RAIL TO ADOPT CLEAR, ENFORCEABLE

01:43:11.151 --> 01:43:12.286
STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS

01:43:12.352 --> 01:43:13.620
DEVELOPED AND CONSULTED IN

01:43:13.687 --> 01:43:14.821
CONSULTATION WITH UTILITIES AND

01:43:14.888 --> 01:43:16.523
CITIES AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS.

01:43:16.590 --> 01:43:18.492
IT ENSURES THAT EARLY ENGAGEMENT

01:43:18.559 --> 01:43:19.526
HAPPENS, RESPONSIBILITIES ARE

01:43:19.593 --> 01:43:20.994
CLEARLY DEFINED AND THAT

01:43:21.061 --> 01:43:22.596
PROJECTS DON'T GET HELD HOSTAGE

01:43:22.663 --> 01:43:24.965
BY FOOT DRAGGING OR RED TAPE.

01:43:25.032 --> 01:43:26.133
EVERY MONTH, WE LET THIRD PARTY

01:43:26.199 --> 01:43:28.168
PERMITTING, DRAG ON TAXPAYERS

01:43:28.235 --> 01:43:30.203
LOSE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, AND

01:43:30.270 --> 01:43:31.905
CALIFORNIANS WAIT LONGER FOR

01:43:31.972 --> 01:43:33.273
CLEANER, FASTER TRANSPORTATION.

01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:35.175
THIS BILL IS THE FIRST TO GIVE

01:43:35.242 --> 01:43:36.510
HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT

01:43:36.577 --> 01:43:37.778
TIMELINES AND EARLY ENGAGEMENT

01:43:37.844 --> 01:43:39.947
RULES, AND IT BACKSTOP DISPUTE

01:43:40.013 --> 01:43:41.381
PROCESS THE SAME PLAYBOOK

01:43:41.448 --> 01:43:43.917
CALTRANS HAS USED FOR DECADES

01:43:43.984 --> 01:43:46.486
FOR FREEWAYS SINCE THE 1950S. I

01:43:46.553 --> 01:43:50.357
URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU.

01:43:50.424 --> 01:43:52.259
YES, SIR. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR.

KEITH DUNN, ON BEHALF OF THE

01:43:53.093 --> 01:43:54.094
STATE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION

01:43:54.161 --> 01:43:55.262
TRADES COUNCIL, AS WELL, THE

01:43:55.329 --> 01:43:56.763
DISTRICT COUNCIL OF IRONWORKERS,

01:43:56.830 --> 01:43:57.965
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, I GUESS

01:43:58.031 --> 01:43:59.600
FIRST, I'D JUST LIKE TO SAY A

01:43:59.666 --> 01:44:00.901
LITTLE CAUTIONARY TALE. YOU SIGN

01:44:00.968 --> 01:44:02.803

01:44:02.869 --> 01:44:04.805
I GUESS YOU GET TO WORK OVER

01:44:04.871 --> 01:44:06.607

MY GOOD FRIEND TO MY LEFT, I

WOULD JUST SAY THAT, YOU KNOW,

01:44:11.211 --> 01:44:12.512
AS YOU BUILD LINEAR

01:44:12.579 --> 01:44:13.814
INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGH DEVELOPED

01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:14.848
CALIFORNIA, YOU ARE GOING TO

01:44:14.915 --> 01:44:17.017
INTERACT WITH OTHER ENTITIES,

01:44:17.084 --> 01:44:19.286
THOSE ENTITIES OR UTILITIES,

01:44:19.353 --> 01:44:20.020
SPECIAL DISTRICTS, EVERYTHING

01:44:20.087 --> 01:44:22.889
THAT THE SENATOR HAS SAID, I

01:44:22.956 --> 01:44:24.691
WOULD LIKE TO TELL THOSE WHO

01:44:24.758 --> 01:44:26.526
YOU'LL HEAR FROM IN JUST A

01:44:26.593 --> 01:44:28.161
MINUTE. YOU KNOW, WE ARE NOT

01:44:28.228 --> 01:44:29.463
TRYING TO IMPEDE THEM, RESTRICT

01:44:29.529 --> 01:44:30.430
THEM OR TELL THEM EXACTLY WHAT

01:44:30.497 --> 01:44:32.966
TO DO. WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS

01:44:33.033 --> 01:44:34.101
THAT RELATIONSHIPS TAKE

01:44:34.167 --> 01:44:34.735
COMMUNICATION. THAT

01:44:34.801 --> 01:44:35.736
COMMUNICATION SOMETIMES NEEDS A

01:44:35.802 --> 01:44:38.171
JUMP START. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS

01:44:38.238 --> 01:44:38.639
IS. WE'D LIKE TO HAVE

01:44:38.705 --> 01:44:40.607
DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM ABOUT HOW

01:44:40.674 --> 01:44:41.708
TO INTERACT ON THEIR SYSTEMS

01:44:41.775 --> 01:44:43.343
WITH THIS SYSTEM. AND IT'S

01:44:43.410 --> 01:44:44.845
IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS HAS BEEN

01:44:44.911 --> 01:44:45.779
MENTIONED, THIS HAS CAUSED

01:44:45.846 --> 01:44:47.381
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF DELAYS.

01:44:47.447 --> 01:44:48.849
HIGH SPEED RAIL IS THE EASIEST

01:44:48.915 --> 01:44:50.550
TO POINT TO BECAUSE IT'S BEEN

01:50:59.119 --> 01:51:00.053
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING, EVEN

01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:02.555
WHEN IT WAS THE BIG, YOU KNOW,

01:51:02.622 --> 01:51:03.890
EXPANSIVE HAIRY BILL AND THEN

01:51:03.957 --> 01:51:05.892
NOW NARROWING IT TO HIGH SPEED

01:51:05.959 --> 01:51:07.560
RAIL, HIGH SPEED RAIL IS

01:51:07.627 --> 01:51:09.496
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. YOU KNOW, I

01:51:09.562 --> 01:51:11.231
COME FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY. I

01:51:11.297 --> 01:51:12.632
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE

01:51:12.699 --> 01:51:14.000
CENTRAL VALLEY, BUT IT IS A

01:51:14.067 --> 01:51:15.535
STRATEGIC ASSET FOR OUR ENTIRE

01:51:15.602 --> 01:51:16.636
STATE. AND ONE OF THE THINGS

01:51:16.703 --> 01:51:19.672
THAT WAS REALLY KEY AND MOST OF

01:51:19.739 --> 01:51:21.341
THE DECISIONS WILL NOT MOST

01:51:21.408 --> 01:51:22.842

01:51:22.909 --> 01:51:23.910
RELATED TO HIGH-SPEED RAIL

01:51:23.977 --> 01:51:25.311
HAPPENED BEFORE I GOT HERE. BUT

01:51:25.378 --> 01:51:27.881
I COULD TELL A KEY DIFFERENCE IN

01:51:27.947 --> 01:51:29.916
HOW WE AS A LEGISLATURE APPROACH

01:51:29.983 --> 01:51:30.950

01:51:34.287 --> 01:51:36.890
THIS NEED. WHEN WE WERE TUSSLING

01:51:36.956 --> 01:51:40.427
WITH THE BIG HAIRY BILL, THIS

01:51:40.493 --> 01:51:42.495
NEED FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL REALLY

01:51:42.562 --> 01:51:44.664
WAS PRIORITIZED AND LAID OUT

01:51:44.731 --> 01:51:47.167
VERY CLEARLY IN THE OIG REPORT

01:51:47.233 --> 01:51:49.369
THAT THIS AUTHORITY WAS NEEDED

01:51:49.436 --> 01:51:51.571
TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS PRIOR

01:51:51.638 --> 01:51:53.606
ISSUES. AND AS WE GO FORWARD,

01:51:53.673 --> 01:51:56.209
AND WE ALL WISH, AND I'VE HEARD

01:51:56.276 --> 01:51:58.678
SOME MEMBERS COME TO ME AS BEING

01:51:58.745 --> 01:51:59.979
ONE OF THE CHAIRS INVOLVED IN

01:52:00.046 --> 01:52:01.881
IT, THAT TOO BAD WE DIDN'T DO

01:52:01.948 --> 01:52:03.183
THIS EARLY ON, BUT JUST BECAUSE

01:52:03.249 --> 01:52:04.984
WE DIDN'T EARLY ON DOESN'T MEAN

01:52:05.051 --> 01:52:06.619
WE CAN'T DO IT NOW. AND THAT'S

01:52:06.686 --> 01:52:08.521
THE KEY PART, THAT ON A GO

01:52:08.588 --> 01:52:11.324
FORWARD, WE NEED TO SET THIS

01:52:11.391 --> 01:52:12.559
PARTICULAR ASSET, STRATEGIC

01:52:12.625 --> 01:52:14.260
ASSET FOR OUR STATE UP FOR

01:52:14.327 --> 01:52:15.628
SUCCESS AND DO EVERYTHING WE CAN

01:52:15.695 --> 01:52:17.430
FOR IT TO BE SUCCESSFUL. AND I

01:52:17.497 --> 01:52:19.466
THINK THAT BY PUSHING FORWARD

01:52:19.532 --> 01:52:21.868
WITH THIS BILL, EVEN THOUGH IT'S

01:52:21.935 --> 01:52:22.435
A LOT OF LANGUAGE, YOU KNOW,

01:52:22.502 --> 01:52:23.970
NEAR THE END, I THINK IT'S WORTH

01:52:24.037 --> 01:52:26.272
IT. AND SO HAPPY TO GIVE UP TIME

01:52:26.339 --> 01:52:28.308
OVER THE SUMMER TO MAKE SURE WE

01:52:28.374 --> 01:52:29.542
DELIVER SOMETHING BACK THAT THE

01:52:29.609 --> 01:52:31.978
FULL LEGISLATURE CAN SUPPORT.

01:52:32.045 --> 01:52:34.647
AND MY COLLEAGUE BEAT ME TO BE

01:52:34.714 --> 01:52:36.950
IN THE MOTION, AND GLAD I CAN BE

01:52:37.016 --> 01:52:38.651
MAKING THE MOTION. GLAD I CAN BE

01:52:38.718 --> 01:52:40.086
THE SECOND. AND JUST APPRECIATE

01:52:40.153 --> 01:52:41.121
ALWAYS YOUR DUE DILIGENCE WHEN

01:52:41.187 --> 01:52:42.689
IT COMES TO YOUR BILLS AND YOUR

01:52:42.755 --> 01:52:44.023
WILLINGNESS TO PUSH, PUSH, PUSH

01:52:44.090 --> 01:52:46.559
UNTIL WE FIND A PATHWAY FORWARD

01:52:46.626 --> 01:52:47.293
WITH EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO.

01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:50.230
THANK YOU. ANYBODY ELSE?

01:52:50.296 --> 01:52:53.833

HAVE A MOTION. AND A SECOND.

01:52:58.972 --> 01:53:00.607

AND AS SOMEONE WHO CAME OUT OF

01:53:21.861 --> 01:53:24.097

PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITY THAT I

01:53:29.202 --> 01:53:32.338
CARE A LOT ABOUT, THIS IS NOT

01:53:32.405 --> 01:53:34.841
ABOUT RIDING ROUGH OVER PEOPLE,

01:53:34.908 --> 01:53:36.409

US FIND THE WAY TO MAKE SURE

01:53:45.051 --> 01:53:47.253
THAT WE DON'T HAVE THESE

01:53:47.320 --> 01:53:48.888
BOTTLENECKS. AND THIS CONTINUING

01:53:48.955 --> 01:53:50.723
BLOCK, I, I WANT TO I WANT THE

01:53:50.790 --> 01:53:53.226
BLACK EYE TO HEAL, AND I KNOW

01:53:53.293 --> 01:53:54.060
THAT IT WILL. AND WE'RE GOING TO

01:53:54.127 --> 01:53:56.129
HAVE A GREAT TRAIN SYSTEM. AND I

01:53:56.196 --> 01:53:57.564
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN I VOTE.

01:53:57.630 --> 01:53:58.932
THANK YOU. SENATOR. I CONTINUE

01:53:58.998 --> 01:54:00.800
TO BE A SUPPORTER OF HIGH SPEED

01:54:00.867 --> 01:54:04.003
RAIL. GOES BACK TO WHEN I WAS A

01:54:04.070 --> 01:54:05.738
CITY PLANNER FOR THE CITY OF

01:54:05.805 --> 01:54:06.940
PALMDALE. I ACTUALLY WORKED ON

01:54:07.006 --> 01:54:09.576
THE PLAN STATION IN PALMDALE AS

01:54:09.642 --> 01:54:11.110
A STAFFER WORKING ON ON THAT

01:54:11.177 --> 01:54:13.880
STATION. I LOOK FORWARD TO

01:54:13.947 --> 01:54:17.250
SEEING, IF NOT HIGH SPEED RAIL,

01:54:17.317 --> 01:54:19.085
BUT BRIGHTLINE IN THE NEAR

01:54:19.152 --> 01:54:20.920
FUTURE. I DO BELIEVE THAT

01:54:20.987 --> 01:54:23.790
BRIGHTLINE WILL BE A GOOD

01:54:23.856 --> 01:54:24.791
COMPETITOR TO THE CALIFORNIA

01:54:24.857 --> 01:54:26.125
HIGH SPEED RAIL, BECAUSE WE

01:54:26.192 --> 01:54:28.061
WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:54:28.127 --> 01:54:30.363
EXPERIENCE HIGH SPEED RAIL AND

01:54:30.430 --> 01:54:31.864
IN THE NEAR FUTURE, I HOPE THAT

01:54:31.931 --> 01:54:33.566
WE CAN CONTINUE THAT

01:54:33.633 --> 01:54:34.267
CONVERSATION. HOW WE CAN

01:54:34.334 --> 01:54:36.836
INTEGRATE BRIGHTLINE COMING TO

01:54:36.903 --> 01:54:38.238
PALMDALE AND THAT PEOPLE CAN

01:54:38.304 --> 01:54:41.407
CONNECT TO THE VICTOR VALLEY OR

01:54:41.474 --> 01:54:43.142
TO CONTINUE TO VEGAS. I DO

01:54:43.209 --> 01:54:45.745
BELIEVE THAT THAT SYSTEM, ONCE

01:54:45.812 --> 01:54:47.947
IT COMES IN PLACE, THEY ALREADY

01:54:48.014 --> 01:54:49.349
HAVE PLANS IN PLACE.

01:54:49.415 --> 01:54:50.316
CONSTRUCTION COULD START ANY

01:54:50.383 --> 01:54:52.318
TIME NOW, AND RIDERSHIP WOULD

01:54:52.385 --> 01:54:54.387
ACTUALLY INCREASE IF PEOPLE WERE

01:54:54.454 --> 01:54:56.522
TO COME FROM LA TO PALMDALE TO

01:54:56.589 --> 01:54:59.425
THROUGH THE HIGH DESERT CORRIDOR,

01:54:59.492 --> 01:55:00.827
TO BRIGHTLINE IN THE VICTOR

01:55:00.893 --> 01:55:02.362
VALLEY IN THEIR WAY TO VEGAS. SO

01:55:02.428 --> 01:55:03.997
CONTINUE TO BE A BIG SUPPORTER.

01:55:04.063 --> 01:55:05.798
AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE

01:55:05.865 --> 01:55:06.933
THE CONVERSATIONS, TO SEE HOW WE

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:08.201
CAN INTEGRATE ALL THE HIGH SPEED

01:55:08.268 --> 01:55:09.569
RAIL PROJECTS WITH CALIFORNIA

01:55:09.636 --> 01:55:11.337
HIGH SPEED RAIL. I LOOK FORWARD

01:55:11.404 --> 01:55:12.839

01:56:17.003 --> 01:56:18.971
AND WE DO HAVE AN AUTHOR HERE.

01:56:19.038 --> 01:56:21.574
AGENDA ITEM NUMBER FOR SB NINE

01:56:21.641 --> 01:56:23.743
BY OREGON SENATOR, WHEN YOU'RE

01:56:23.810 --> 01:56:29.015
READY. WELL, GOOD AFTERNOON, MR.

01:56:29.082 --> 01:56:30.416
CHAIR. AND MEMBERS. THANK YOU

01:56:30.483 --> 01:56:31.984
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT

01:56:32.051 --> 01:56:34.487
SB NINE. AND SB NINE REALLY DOES

01:56:34.554 --> 01:56:36.656
ONE THING, AND THIS IS NOT THE

01:56:36.723 --> 01:56:38.624
SB NINE THAT WE ALL KNOW. THIS

01:56:38.691 --> 01:56:42.795
IS A MUCH NARROWER BILL. AND WE

01:56:42.862 --> 01:56:44.330
STARTED OUT THIS BILL BY REALLY

01:56:44.397 --> 01:56:46.332
TRYING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF

01:56:46.399 --> 01:56:47.467
OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS FOR

01:56:47.533 --> 01:56:49.635
ADUS IN THAT PROCESS, AND

01:56:49.702 --> 01:56:51.037
WORKING WITH SENATE COMMITTEE

01:56:51.104 --> 01:56:53.306
STAFF, WE LEARNED THAT EXISTING

01:56:53.373 --> 01:56:55.575
LAW ALREADY DOES EXEMPT OWNER

01:56:55.641 --> 01:56:56.142
OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS. THE

01:56:56.209 --> 01:56:58.478
CHAIRS A BILL AROUND ADUS, WHICH

01:56:58.544 --> 01:57:00.213
I STRONGLY SUPPORT. WHAT THIS

01:57:00.279 --> 01:57:04.016
BILL DOES IS TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE

01:57:04.083 --> 01:57:05.685
IMPLEMENTATION OF STATE ADU LAW.

01:57:05.752 --> 01:57:08.221
AND SO STATE AID LAWS EVOLVED

01:57:08.287 --> 01:57:09.789
OVER THE YEARS. AND I REALLY

01:57:09.856 --> 01:57:11.791
WANT TO CREDIT THE LEGISLATURE

01:57:11.858 --> 01:57:13.593
FOR REALLY MAKING CRITICAL

01:57:13.659 --> 01:57:15.428
CHANGES TO STREAMLINE THE

01:57:15.495 --> 01:57:16.696
PROCESS TO GET THESE AFFORDABLE

01:57:16.763 --> 01:57:18.564
HOMES BUILT IN NEIGHBORHOODS

01:57:18.631 --> 01:57:20.166
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA, ACTUALLY,

01:57:20.233 --> 01:57:22.635
ADUS ARE, I THINK, REPRESENT THE

01:57:22.702 --> 01:57:24.404
BIGGEST INCREASE IN HOUSING

01:57:24.470 --> 01:57:25.972
PRODUCTION OF ANY SORT OF TYPE

01:57:26.038 --> 01:57:27.673
OF BUILDING TYPE IN CALIFORNIA

01:57:27.740 --> 01:57:29.442
AS A RESULT OF THIS WORK. BUT

01:57:29.509 --> 01:57:31.310
THERE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE LOCAL

01:57:31.377 --> 01:57:32.779
GOVERNMENTS HAVE NOT UPDATED

01:57:32.845 --> 01:57:34.547
THEIR LOCAL ORDINANCES TO

01:57:34.614 --> 01:57:36.382
REFLECT THE CHANGES IN STATE ADU

01:57:36.449 --> 01:57:39.185
LAW, OR ARE ACTIVELY PASSING

01:57:39.252 --> 01:57:41.020
POLICIES TO CIRCUMVENT THE

01:57:41.087 --> 01:57:42.555
PROVISIONS OF STATE ADU LAW. AND

01:57:42.622 --> 01:57:44.357
SO WHAT SB NINE THIS SB NINE

01:57:44.424 --> 01:57:49.395
WOULD DO IS IF A LOCAL AGENCY.

01:57:49.462 --> 01:57:51.063
WELL, FIRST, WHEN A LOCAL AGENCY

01:57:51.130 --> 01:57:52.365
ADOPTS AN ADU ORDINANCE, THEY

01:57:52.432 --> 01:57:54.300
HAVE TO SUBMIT IT TO STATE HCD

01:57:54.367 --> 01:57:55.768
TO HAVE STATE AGENCY REVIEW IT

01:57:55.835 --> 01:57:57.236
TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH STATE

01:57:57.303 --> 01:58:00.006
LAW. IF HCD SAYS THAT THAT

01:58:00.072 --> 01:58:02.208
ORDINANCE IS NOT IN COMPLIANCE

01:58:02.275 --> 01:58:05.077
IN ANY WAY, THEY SPECIFY THE

01:58:05.144 --> 01:58:05.745
PROVISIONS OF THE ORDINANCE THAT

01:58:05.812 --> 01:58:08.748
NEED TO BE CORRECTED TO ENSURE

01:58:08.815 --> 01:58:10.817
CONFORMITY. AND SO WHAT THIS

01:58:10.883 --> 01:58:13.786
BILL WOULD DO IS IF A LOCAL

01:58:13.853 --> 01:58:15.188
AGENCY DOES NOT SUBMIT THEIR

01:58:15.254 --> 01:58:18.825
ORDINANCE TO HCD FOR REVIEW, OR

01:58:18.891 --> 01:58:20.760
DOES NOT RESPOND TO THE

01:58:20.827 --> 01:58:22.395
DEPARTMENT'S FINDINGS, AND BY

01:58:22.462 --> 01:58:23.863
RESPOND, RESPOND SIMPLY JUST

01:58:23.930 --> 01:58:25.998
SAYING, HEY, WE GOT YOUR YOUR

COMMENTS. WE ARE WORKING TO MAKE

01:58:28.601 --> 01:58:30.536
CORRECTIONS. WE DON'T YOU DON'T

01:58:30.603 --> 01:58:31.871
HAVE TO AMEND YOUR ORDINANCE OR

01:58:31.938 --> 01:58:33.506
AMEND YOUR GENERAL PLAN TO

01:58:33.573 --> 01:58:34.574
CONFORM WITHIN 30 DAYS. IT'S

01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:36.108
JUST SIMPLY RESPONDING. SO

01:58:36.175 --> 01:58:37.643
THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL WOULD SAY

01:58:37.710 --> 01:58:40.046
IS IF YOU FAIL TO SUBMIT A COPY

01:58:40.112 --> 01:58:41.314
OF THE ORDINANCE AS REQUIRED BY

01:58:41.380 --> 01:58:43.316
STATE LAW, OR RESPOND TO THE

01:58:43.382 --> 01:58:45.885
DEPARTMENT'S FINDINGS WITHIN 30

01:58:45.952 --> 01:58:48.621
DAYS, THAT THE LOCAL ORDINANCE

01:58:48.688 --> 01:58:49.856
SHALL NOT BE OPERATIVE IN THE

01:58:49.922 --> 01:58:51.290
STATE. STANDARD SHALL APPLY

YIMBY. CALIFORNIA'S NATION

LEADING ADU REFORMS HAVE HELPED

01:59:22.588 --> 01:59:23.890
HOMEOWNERS BUILD TENS OF

01:59:23.956 --> 01:59:26.259
THOUSANDS OF NEW HOMES, WITH 80

01:59:26.325 --> 01:59:28.528
YEARS GROWING FROM LESS THAN 1%

01:59:28.594 --> 01:59:30.396
OF NEW CONSTRUCTION IN 2016 TO

01:59:30.463 --> 01:59:32.398
FULLY ONE FIFTH OF NEW HOMES

01:59:32.465 --> 01:59:35.768
TODAY. THESE UNITS BLEND INTO

01:59:35.835 --> 01:59:37.236
EXISTING NEIGHBORHOODS AND ADD

01:59:37.303 --> 01:59:38.404

LOOK AND FEEL, UC BERKELEY

01:59:41.440 --> 01:59:43.009
RESEARCH SHOWS US THAT ADUS ARE

01:59:43.075 --> 01:59:44.477
BEING BUILT IN ALMOST EVERY

01:59:44.544 --> 01:59:45.945
NEIGHBORHOOD IN THE STATE, AND

01:59:46.012 --> 01:59:47.513
THAT THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY

01:59:47.580 --> 01:59:49.315
OF THEM ARE BEING USED AS LONG

01:59:49.382 --> 01:59:52.151
TERM HOUSING FOR FAMILY, FRIENDS

01:59:52.218 --> 01:59:55.288

01:59:55.354 --> 01:59:56.722
ADU REFORMS HAVE SUCCEEDED IN

01:59:56.789 --> 01:59:57.890
GETTING HOMES BUILT, IN LARGE

01:59:57.957 --> 01:59:59.892
PART BECAUSE THEY ARE STATEWIDE.

01:59:59.959 --> 02:00:00.927
THEY REPLACE A PATCHWORK OF

02:00:00.993 --> 02:00:02.094
LOCAL ZONING CODES WITH A

02:00:02.161 --> 02:00:04.196
CONSISTENT SET OF SIMPLE RULES

02:00:04.263 --> 02:00:05.498
FOR WHAT HOMEOWNERS CAN BUILD,

02:00:05.565 --> 02:00:07.900
AND THEY APPLY THEM IN EVERY

02:00:07.967 --> 02:00:08.901
JURISDICTION. THESE CONSISTENT

02:00:08.968 --> 02:00:10.436
ZONING STANDARDS ARE PREPARED

02:00:10.503 --> 02:00:12.538
WITH THE FAST, CONSISTENT, AND

02:00:12.605 --> 02:00:14.774
RELIABLE PERMITTING PROCEDURES.

02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:16.609
THIS STANDARDIZATION ALLOWS ADU

02:00:16.676 --> 02:00:18.778
BUILDERS TO WORK ACROSS MULTIPLE

02:00:18.844 --> 02:00:20.046
JURISDICTIONS, AND ENCOURAGES

02:00:20.112 --> 02:00:21.714
INVESTMENT BY GIVING HOMEOWNERS

02:00:21.781 --> 02:00:23.015
CONFIDENCE THAT THEY WILL

02:00:23.082 --> 02:00:23.916
ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO SECURE

02:00:23.983 --> 02:00:26.686
PERMITS. HOWEVER, LOCAL ADU

02:00:26.752 --> 02:00:28.120
ORDINANCES AND PERMITTING

02:00:28.187 --> 02:00:29.121
PROCESSES ARE NOT ALWAYS

02:00:29.188 --> 02:00:30.856
CONSISTENT WITH STATE STANDARDS.

02:00:30.923 --> 02:00:33.059
IN THESE CASES, HCD STEPS IN AND

02:00:33.125 --> 02:00:34.760
WORKS WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS,

02:00:34.827 --> 02:00:35.928
PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

02:00:35.995 --> 02:00:37.663
TO HELP THEM ADOPT POLICIES THAT

02:00:37.730 --> 02:00:40.232
ARE IN LINE WITH THE RULES. SB9

02:00:40.299 --> 02:00:41.968
STRENGTHENS EXISTING STATE LAW

02:00:42.034 --> 02:00:43.669
BY ESTABLISHING A CLEAR,

02:00:43.736 --> 02:00:44.637
STRAIGHTFORWARD AND

02:00:44.704 --> 02:00:46.472
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM. IF A

02:00:46.539 --> 02:00:48.240
LOCAL AGENCY FAILS TO SUBMIT ITS

02:00:48.307 --> 02:00:50.142
ADU ORDINANCE OR FAILS TO

02:00:50.209 --> 02:00:52.578
RESPOND TO HCD'S FINDINGS OF

02:00:52.645 --> 02:00:53.179
NONCOMPLIANCE, THAT ORDINANCE

02:00:53.245 --> 02:00:55.348
BECOMES NULL AND VOID. THE CITY

02:00:55.414 --> 02:00:56.849
OR COUNTY MUST THEN APPLY

02:00:56.916 --> 02:00:58.584
DEFAULT STATE STANDARDS UNTIL A

02:00:58.651 --> 02:01:00.820
COMPLIANT ORDINANCE IS ADOPTED.

02:01:00.886 --> 02:01:02.588
THIS CHANGE REINFORCES EXISTING

02:01:02.655 --> 02:01:04.390
LAW, ENSURES TIMELY

02:01:04.457 --> 02:01:05.524
IMPLEMENTATION, AND PROTECTS

02:01:05.591 --> 02:01:06.525
HOMEOWNERS FROM LOCAL BARRIERS

02:01:06.592 --> 02:01:08.527
TO BUILDING ADUS. WE

02:01:08.594 --> 02:01:13.466
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTES.

02:01:13.532 --> 02:01:14.934
GOOD AFTERNOON, CHAIR CARRILLO

02:01:15.001 --> 02:01:17.103
AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. MY NAME IS

02:01:17.169 --> 02:01:19.238
JONATHAN PACHECO, BEALL, VP OF

02:01:19.305 --> 02:01:21.240
POLICY AND PROGRAMS AT CASITA

02:01:21.307 --> 02:01:23.009
COALITION. WE'RE A STATEWIDE

02:01:23.075 --> 02:01:24.977
NONPROFIT THAT REMOVES BARRIERS

02:01:25.044 --> 02:01:26.545
TO BUILDING SMALLER AND MORE

02:01:26.612 --> 02:01:28.714
AFFORDABLE HOMES. MY BACKGROUND

02:01:28.781 --> 02:01:31.017
INCLUDES 14 YEARS OF LOCAL

02:01:31.083 --> 02:01:32.485
GOVERNMENT SERVICE AS A

02:01:32.551 --> 02:01:34.787
MUNICIPAL URBAN PLANNER AND CODE

02:01:34.854 --> 02:01:35.921
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER IN LOS

02:01:35.988 --> 02:01:38.591
ANGELES COUNTY. FROM THAT

02:01:38.658 --> 02:01:40.359
EXPERIENCE ON THE GROUND, I'VE

02:01:40.426 --> 02:01:42.461
SEEN HOW THE INTENT OF STATE

02:01:42.528 --> 02:01:44.697
HOUSING LAW DOESN'T ALWAYS

02:01:44.764 --> 02:01:47.266
TRANSLATE LOCALLY. SB9 WILL

02:01:47.333 --> 02:01:49.368
ENSURE THAT LOCAL LAWS REGARDING

02:01:49.435 --> 02:01:51.203
PERMITTING AND CONSTRUCTION OF

02:01:51.270 --> 02:01:58.511
ACCESSORY DWELLING. UNITS ARE

02:01:58.577 --> 02:02:01.280
FULLY CONSISTENT WITH STATE LAW

02:02:01.347 --> 02:02:04.050
SB9. IF HCD FINDS NONCOMPLIANCE,

02:02:04.116 --> 02:02:06.385
THE MUNICIPALITY MUST RESPOND TO

02:02:06.452 --> 02:02:09.288
THOSE FINDINGS WITHIN 30 DAYS.

02:02:09.355 --> 02:02:11.023
OTHERWISE, THAT ADU ORDINANCE IS

02:02:11.090 --> 02:02:12.792
NULLIFIED AND STATE ADU

02:02:12.858 --> 02:02:14.360
STANDARDS APPLY LOCALLY UNTIL

02:02:14.427 --> 02:02:16.629
LOCAL COMPLIANCE IS ACHIEVED.

02:02:16.696 --> 02:02:18.931
SB9 IS NEEDED BECAUSE SOME LOCAL

02:02:18.998 --> 02:02:21.133
ORDINANCES AND LOCAL PRACTICES

02:02:21.200 --> 02:02:23.302
ARE INCONSISTENT WITH STATE ADU

02:02:23.369 --> 02:02:26.605
LAW. THIS RESULTS IN BARRIERS,

02:02:26.672 --> 02:02:27.907
BARRIERS THAT DELAY OR BLOCK

02:02:27.973 --> 02:02:30.876
PRODUCTION OF ADUS, A WIDELY

02:02:30.943 --> 02:02:32.678
POPULAR AND MORE AFFORDABLE HOME

02:02:32.745 --> 02:02:35.147
TYPE THAT ALL KINDS OF FAMILIES

02:02:35.214 --> 02:02:37.516
USE TO MEET THEIR HOUSING NEEDS.

02:02:37.583 --> 02:02:39.819
SB9 CREATES A REASONABLE

02:02:39.885 --> 02:02:41.253
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM TO

02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:43.122
ENSURE LOCAL LAWS COMPLY WITH

02:02:43.189 --> 02:02:45.091
BOTH THE LANGUAGE AND INTENT OF

02:02:45.157 --> 02:02:48.094
STATE LAW. CASITA COALITION

02:02:48.160 --> 02:02:49.929
SUPPORTS SB9 TO ENSURE

02:02:49.995 --> 02:02:51.697
CONSISTENCY BETWEEN LOCAL AND

CAPACITY. PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION

02:06:53.172 --> 02:06:56.075
STOPS. THIS IS REALLY WHAT THIS

02:06:56.141 --> 02:07:01.146
BILL BOTTOM LINE IS ABOUT IS

02:07:01.213 --> 02:07:03.148
WHEN WE ARE MAKING SIGNIFICANT

02:07:03.215 --> 02:07:06.151
PUBLIC INVESTMENTS IN PUBLIC

02:07:06.218 --> 02:07:08.087
TRANSPORTATION, WHEN WE'RE

02:07:08.153 --> 02:07:09.822

02:07:09.888 --> 02:07:12.257

ACTUALLY BUILD ENOUGH HOUSING

02:07:15.294 --> 02:07:17.429
AROUND THEM SO THAT PEOPLE CAN

02:07:17.496 --> 02:07:18.764
WALK TO THEM AND USE THEM, AND

02:07:18.831 --> 02:07:20.733
WE CAN HAVE THE RIDERSHIP WE

02:07:31.377 --> 02:07:34.947

NANCY, WHICH WE HAD THE CHAIR

02:07:44.256 --> 02:07:45.924
AND I HAD AGREED ON AFTER THE

02:07:45.991 --> 02:07:47.459
ANALYSIS CAME OUT. SO WE'RE

02:07:47.526 --> 02:07:48.560
ACCEPTING ALL THE AMENDMENTS

02:07:48.627 --> 02:07:51.530

GRATEFUL TO THE CHAIR AND THE

02:07:56.301 --> 02:08:00.139
COMMITTEE. YOU'RE WELCOME. YEAH.

02:08:00.205 --> 02:08:02.341
AND COLLEAGUES, I ALSO I DO JUST

02:08:02.408 --> 02:08:04.943
WANT TO SAY FROM THE VERY

02:08:05.010 --> 02:08:06.278
BEGINNING OF THIS BILL, WE HAVE

02:08:06.345 --> 02:08:08.747
WORKED VERY HARD, VERY, VERY

02:08:08.814 --> 02:08:11.350
HARD TO RESPOND TO FEEDBACK ON

02:08:11.417 --> 02:08:14.319
THE BILL, CRITICISM OF THE BILL.

02:08:14.386 --> 02:08:16.321
WE TOOK A HUGE SWATH OF

02:08:16.388 --> 02:08:18.023
AMENDMENTS BASED ON FEEDBACK

02:08:18.090 --> 02:08:20.225
FROM MEMBERS AND STAKEHOLDERS IN

02:08:20.292 --> 02:08:22.494
SENATE APPROPRIATIONS. WE'VE

02:08:22.561 --> 02:08:25.764
WORKED VERY HARD WITH MR. HANEY

02:08:25.831 --> 02:08:27.266
AND ASSEMBLY HOUSING COMMITTEE

02:08:27.332 --> 02:08:30.436
AND TOOK SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS

02:08:30.502 --> 02:08:32.071
TO PROTECT AGAINST DEMOLITIONS

02:08:32.137 --> 02:08:34.039
AND DISPLACEMENT AND TO ENSURE

02:08:34.106 --> 02:08:36.575
THERE WAS ADEQUATE AFFORDABILITY

02:08:36.642 --> 02:08:39.611
IN THE BILL. WE THEN WORKED, OF

02:08:39.678 --> 02:08:41.280
COURSE, VERY CLOSELY WITH THE

02:08:41.346 --> 02:08:43.449
CHAIR ON VARIOUS AMENDMENTS

02:08:43.515 --> 02:08:46.318
AROUND LOCAL GOVERNMENT ISSUES.

02:08:46.385 --> 02:08:50.122
IN ADDITION, LAST WEEK WE MADE

02:08:50.189 --> 02:08:51.423
SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS TO THE

02:08:51.490 --> 02:08:54.860
BILL, PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON THE

02:08:54.927 --> 02:08:57.129
LOCAL FLEXIBILITY OPTION ON THIS

02:08:57.196 --> 02:08:59.231
BILL, WHICH GIVES LOCAL

02:08:59.298 --> 02:09:00.399
GOVERNMENTS THE ABILITY TO CRAFT

02:09:00.466 --> 02:09:03.535
THEIR OWN ALTERNATIVE PLAN IF

02:09:03.602 --> 02:09:04.970
THEY DON'T WANT TO DO EXACTLY

02:09:05.037 --> 02:09:07.906
WHAT THE BILL REQUIRES. WE FLESH

02:09:07.973 --> 02:09:09.608
THAT OUT, MADE IT MORE ROBUST.

02:09:09.675 --> 02:09:12.911
AND THEN WE ALSO INCLUDED A

02:09:12.978 --> 02:09:15.013
TEMPORARY, DELAYED

02:09:15.080 --> 02:09:16.949
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BILL FOR

02:09:17.015 --> 02:09:18.684
CITIES THAT HAVE ALREADY ENGAGED

02:09:18.750 --> 02:09:19.985
IN TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT.

02:09:20.052 --> 02:09:21.720
UPZONING IF THE CITY HAS DONE

02:09:21.787 --> 02:09:25.624
GOOD WORK TO DO TOD, WE WANT TO

02:09:25.691 --> 02:09:27.359
HONOR THAT, AND THEY WILL HAVE

02:09:27.426 --> 02:09:29.828
DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION AS A

02:09:29.895 --> 02:09:34.433
RESULT. AND SO, YOU KNOW, THIS

02:09:34.500 --> 02:09:36.935
IS REALLY ABOUT NOT ONLY

02:09:37.002 --> 02:09:39.972
ADDRESSING OUR HOUSING CRISIS BY

02:09:40.038 --> 02:09:42.107
BUILDING MORE HOMES. WE KNOW

02:09:42.174 --> 02:09:43.542
THAT THE HOUSING CRISIS, WHICH

02:09:43.609 --> 02:09:45.744
IS A HOUSING SHORTAGE, IS HAVING

02:09:45.811 --> 02:09:48.547
SO MANY HARMFUL IMPACTS ON

02:09:48.614 --> 02:09:50.949
CALIFORNIA, RANGING FROM DRIVING

02:09:51.016 --> 02:09:53.252
MIDDLE CLASS AND WORKING CLASS

02:09:53.318 --> 02:09:55.187
PEOPLE OUT OF THE STATE, PUSHING

02:09:55.254 --> 02:09:58.457
YOUNG PEOPLE OUT. IT IS HARMING

02:09:58.524 --> 02:10:00.058
OUR ECONOMY AND THE ABILITY OF

02:10:00.125 --> 02:10:03.428
EMPLOYERS TO FIND WORKERS. IT IS

02:10:03.495 --> 02:10:06.165
ALSO HARMING US IN TERMS OF

02:10:06.231 --> 02:10:07.633
REPRESENTATION IN THE HOUSE OF

02:10:07.699 --> 02:10:08.767
REPRESENTATIVES AFTER THE NEXT

02:10:08.834 --> 02:10:10.903
CENSUS, WHERE WE ARE PROJECTED

02:10:10.969 --> 02:10:13.038
TO LOSE SEATS TO STATES THAT

02:10:13.105 --> 02:10:14.840
BUILD MORE HOUSING, AND WE NEED

02:10:14.907 --> 02:10:16.842
TO TURN THAT AROUND, WE ALSO

02:10:16.909 --> 02:10:18.610
NEED TO SUPPORT OUR PUBLIC

02:10:18.677 --> 02:10:20.045
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS, AND THIS

02:10:20.112 --> 02:10:21.813
WILL HELP DO THAT. AND WE NEED

02:10:21.880 --> 02:10:23.215
TO GIVE PEOPLE OPTIONS OTHER

02:10:23.282 --> 02:10:24.783
THAN DRIVING. AND THE WAY TO DO

02:10:24.850 --> 02:10:26.919
THAT IS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR

02:10:26.985 --> 02:10:28.820
THEM TO LIVE NEAR PUBLIC

02:10:28.887 --> 02:10:29.922
TRANSPORTATION. WE HAVE A BROAD

02:10:29.988 --> 02:10:31.256
COALITION BEHIND THE BILL. WE'RE

02:10:31.323 --> 02:10:33.158
GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE

02:10:33.225 --> 02:10:34.960
BILL IF IT GETS OUT OF THE

02:10:35.027 --> 02:10:37.296
COMMITTEE TODAY. I'M EXTREMELY

02:10:37.362 --> 02:10:37.729
APPRECIATIVE FOR THE

02:10:37.796 --> 02:10:38.263
COLLABORATION, AND I

02:10:38.330 --> 02:10:40.532
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE

02:10:40.599 --> 02:10:41.433

02:10:41.500 --> 02:10:43.969

AND A BOARD MEMBER OF THE LOS

02:10:48.874 --> 02:10:49.841
ANGELES COUNTY AFFORDABLE

02:10:49.908 --> 02:10:52.611
HOUSING SOLUTIONS AGENCY AND A

02:10:52.678 --> 02:10:54.079
SENIOR POLICY ADVISOR OF THE

02:10:54.146 --> 02:10:55.280
INNER CITY LAW CENTER, AS WELL

02:10:55.347 --> 02:10:57.382
AS MICHAEL TUBBS, FORMERLY THE

02:10:57.449 --> 02:10:59.218
MAYOR OF STOCKTON AND THE

02:10:59.284 --> 02:11:01.386
FOUNDER OF END POVERTY,

02:11:01.453 --> 02:11:04.923
CALIFORNIA. MR. CHAIR, ESTEEMED

02:11:04.990 --> 02:11:07.426
MEMBERS JED LIANO, SENIOR POLICY

02:11:07.492 --> 02:11:08.460
ADVISOR, INNER CITY LAW CENTER,

02:11:08.527 --> 02:11:10.662
AND ALSO CLAREMONT CITY COUNCIL

02:11:10.729 --> 02:11:12.598
MEMBER. I WAS FIRST ELECTED SIX

02:11:12.664 --> 02:11:13.532
YEARS AGO WITH AN AMBITIOUS

02:11:13.599 --> 02:11:15.300
AGENDA OF BRINGING AFFORDABLE

02:11:15.367 --> 02:11:16.702
HOUSING TO AN OTHERWISE

02:11:16.768 --> 02:11:18.337
UNAFFORDABLE CITY, AND SINCE

02:11:18.403 --> 02:11:20.105
THEN, WE'VE APPROVED OUR FIRST

02:11:20.172 --> 02:11:20.739
AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS

02:11:20.806 --> 02:11:22.541
IN ALMOST IN ALMOST TWO DECADES.

02:11:22.608 --> 02:11:25.110
RE ZONED FOR OVER 2000 UNITS,

02:11:25.177 --> 02:11:26.778
AND CREATED AN INCLUSIONARY

02:11:26.845 --> 02:11:27.980
ZONING PROGRAM THAT ENSURES

02:11:28.046 --> 02:11:30.382
MARKET RATE PROJECTS CAN STILL

02:11:30.449 --> 02:11:31.750
PENCIL. NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE

02:11:31.817 --> 02:11:33.619
BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT

02:11:33.685 --> 02:11:34.319
COOPERATION FROM DIFFERENT

02:11:34.386 --> 02:11:36.154
LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. AND THESE

02:11:36.221 --> 02:11:37.689
INITIATIVES REACHED THE FINISH

02:11:37.756 --> 02:11:39.358
LINE ONLY BECAUSE LEADERS

02:11:39.424 --> 02:11:40.859
DECIDED THAT WORKING TOGETHER

02:11:40.926 --> 02:11:42.661
WAS BETTER THAN CONFLICT.

02:11:42.728 --> 02:11:45.030
RESOLVING DIFFERENCES WAS BETTER

02:11:45.097 --> 02:11:48.533
THAN ELEVATING THEM. SB 79 IS A

02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:51.036
BALANCED BILL THAT RECOGNIZES

02:11:51.103 --> 02:11:53.005
BOTH THE ABSOLUTE CRUSHING

02:11:53.071 --> 02:11:55.741
DEMAND FOR MORE HOMES WITH THE

02:11:55.807 --> 02:11:58.110
VALUE OF LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS.

02:11:58.176 --> 02:11:59.378
OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL IS

02:11:59.444 --> 02:12:01.113
OFFERING A THEORY OF THIS CASE

02:12:01.179 --> 02:12:03.115
THAT IS UNFORTUNATELY BASED ON

02:12:03.181 --> 02:12:04.383
CONFLICT. IT SUGGESTS THAT YOU

02:12:04.449 --> 02:12:06.818
MUST MAKE A CHOICE BETWEEN LOCAL

02:12:06.885 --> 02:12:08.687
CONTROL AND HOUSING PRODUCTION,

02:12:08.754 --> 02:12:10.455
A CHOICE BETWEEN CITY

02:12:10.522 --> 02:12:11.390
SELF-GOVERNANCE AND REQUIRED

02:12:11.456 --> 02:12:13.625
STATE MANDATES. BUT THIS IS A

02:12:13.692 --> 02:12:16.161
FALSE CHOICE. BY INCLUDING

02:12:16.228 --> 02:12:18.063
FLEXIBILITY FOR ALTERNATIVE

02:12:18.130 --> 02:12:20.499
PLANS. SB 79 ISN'T JUST A

02:12:20.565 --> 02:12:23.035
MANDATE, IT'S ALSO AN

02:12:23.101 --> 02:12:24.870
INVITATION, AN INVITATION TO

02:12:24.936 --> 02:12:27.005
PARTNER IN THE SHARED GOALS OF

02:12:27.072 --> 02:12:28.807
PRODUCING HOMES, REDUCING

02:12:28.874 --> 02:12:30.709
VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AND

02:12:30.776 --> 02:12:32.311
PROMOTING SUSTAINABILITY. WE

02:12:32.377 --> 02:12:33.945
SHOULD REJECT THAT FALSE CHOICE

02:12:34.012 --> 02:12:35.881
AND INSTEAD WORK TOGETHER TO

02:12:35.947 --> 02:12:38.350
DELIVER SOLUTIONS FOR PEOPLE WHO

02:12:38.417 --> 02:12:40.252
CANNOT AFFORD HOUSING. PLEASE

02:12:40.319 --> 02:12:42.321
USE YOUR VOTE TODAY TO REJECT

02:12:42.387 --> 02:12:44.589
THE POLITICS OF CONFLICT. VOTE

02:12:44.656 --> 02:12:46.425
IN SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO ARE

02:12:46.491 --> 02:12:48.994
HOUSING UNSTABLE IN OR ON THE

02:12:49.061 --> 02:12:50.362
BRINK OF HOMELESSNESS. PEOPLE

02:12:50.429 --> 02:12:52.297
WHO ARE UNREPRESENTED IN THIS

02:12:52.364 --> 02:12:53.632
ROOM AND DO NOT HAVE A VOICE

02:12:53.699 --> 02:12:55.000
LIKE OUR CLIENTS AT INNER CITY

02:12:55.067 --> 02:12:57.536
LAW CENTER. THANK YOU, MR.

02:12:57.602 --> 02:13:04.343
CHAIR, FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. GOOD

02:13:04.409 --> 02:13:05.977
AFTERNOON, MR. CHAIR, AND

02:13:06.044 --> 02:13:06.878
MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY LOCAL

02:13:06.945 --> 02:13:08.513
GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS

02:13:08.580 --> 02:13:09.915
MICHAEL TUBBS. I'M THE FORMER

02:13:09.981 --> 02:13:11.183
MAYOR OF STOCKTON, CALIFORNIA,

02:13:11.249 --> 02:13:12.117
AND THE FOUNDER OF END POVERTY

02:13:12.184 --> 02:13:14.986
IN CALIFORNIA. AND I'M HERE TO

02:13:15.053 --> 02:13:18.123
OFFER STRONG SUPPORT FOR SB 79,

02:13:18.190 --> 02:13:20.592
NOT BECAUSE IT'S AN EASY BILL,

02:13:20.659 --> 02:13:21.893
BUT BUT BECAUSE IT'S A BILL

02:13:21.960 --> 02:13:23.061
THAT'S GEARED TOWARDS SOLVING

02:13:23.128 --> 02:13:24.463
ONE OF OUR HARDEST PROBLEMS,

02:13:24.529 --> 02:13:25.597
WHICH IS A SEVERE HOUSING

02:13:25.664 --> 02:13:28.867
SHORTAGE WE HAVE IN THE STATE.

02:13:28.934 --> 02:13:31.470
WE KNOW THAT THERE'S OVER

02:13:31.536 --> 02:13:32.871
400,000 FOLKS IN THIS STATE THAT

02:13:32.938 --> 02:13:34.773
ARE SUPER COMMUTERS WHO SPEND

02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:36.174
THREE HOURS OR MORE A DAY GOING

02:13:36.241 --> 02:13:38.677
TO WORK, AND 8 MILLION PEOPLE IN

02:13:38.744 --> 02:13:40.112
OUR STATE ARE RENT BURDEN,

02:13:40.178 --> 02:13:41.546
PEOPLE WHO ARE SPENDING MORE

02:13:41.613 --> 02:13:42.714
THAN 50% OF THEIR INCOME ON

02:13:42.781 --> 02:13:44.616
RENT. AND WE KNOW THAT A BIG WAY

02:13:44.683 --> 02:13:46.551
OF HELPING THEM SOLVE THAT THEIR

02:13:46.618 --> 02:13:47.819
NEEDS IS TO ALLOW THEM TO HAVE

02:13:47.886 --> 02:13:49.721
HOUSING NEAR WHERE THEY WORK,

02:13:49.788 --> 02:13:50.655
HOUSING NEAR TRANSIT AND HOUSING

02:13:50.722 --> 02:13:52.224
THAT THEY CAN AFFORD. WE ALSO

02:13:52.290 --> 02:13:53.125
KNOW THAT THIS BILL HELPS TACKLE

02:13:53.191 --> 02:13:55.127
SOME OF OUR OTHER ISSUES, THOSE

02:13:55.193 --> 02:13:56.461
OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND THOSE OF

02:13:56.528 --> 02:13:58.497
SEVERE TRANSIT UNDERFUNDING. SO

02:13:58.563 --> 02:14:00.999
I WOULD URGE YOUR STRONG, STRONG

02:14:01.066 --> 02:14:03.034
SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL AS A WAY

02:14:03.101 --> 02:14:05.170

LAND USE AUTHORITY ON PROPERTY

02:21:45.063 --> 02:21:46.731
THEY OWN OR HAVE PERMANENT

02:21:46.798 --> 02:21:48.199
EASEMENT. IT ALSO GRANTS THEM

02:21:48.266 --> 02:21:49.634
THE AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE WHAT

02:21:49.701 --> 02:21:52.003
SITES QUALIFY AS TOD, WITHOUT

02:21:52.070 --> 02:21:53.471
ANY REGARD FOR LOCAL DEVELOPMENT

02:21:53.538 --> 02:21:54.472
STANDARDS AND STATE APPROVED

02:21:54.539 --> 02:21:56.841
HOUSING PLANS. CITY LEADERS

02:21:56.908 --> 02:21:57.842
UNDERSTAND THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS

02:21:57.909 --> 02:22:00.044
BEST. THE TRAFFIC PATTERNS, THE

02:22:00.111 --> 02:22:01.412
INFRASTRUCTURE CONSTRAINTS, THE

02:22:01.479 --> 02:22:03.081
CHARACTER OF THE COMMUNITY, AND

02:22:03.147 --> 02:22:05.650
THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE WE CALL

02:22:05.717 --> 02:22:07.118
HOME. THROUGH COMMUNITY LED

02:22:07.185 --> 02:22:08.753
DECISION MAKING, WE CAN BALANCE

02:22:08.820 --> 02:22:10.788
GROWTH WITHIN REASONABLE

02:22:10.855 --> 02:22:12.957
PLANNING. THE CITY OF PARAMOUNT

02:22:13.024 --> 02:22:13.958
SPENT THREE YEARS TO ADOPT THE

02:22:14.025 --> 02:22:16.294
NORTH PARAMOUNT GATEWAY PLAN TO

02:22:16.361 --> 02:22:17.962
HELP THE CITY PLAN FOR TRANSIT

02:22:18.029 --> 02:22:19.464
ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT NEAR

02:22:19.530 --> 02:22:20.498
METRO'S PLANNED SOUTHEAST

02:22:20.565 --> 02:22:22.867
GATEWAY LINE. THE SPECIFIC PLAN

02:22:22.934 --> 02:22:24.569
WAS DEVELOPED THROUGH EXTENSIVE

02:22:24.636 --> 02:22:26.237
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND ENSURES

02:22:26.304 --> 02:22:28.039
THAT CITIES CAN PROVIDE THE

02:22:28.106 --> 02:22:29.641
INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES TO

02:22:29.707 --> 02:22:32.076
SUPPORT THE PROJECT AND MEET THE

02:22:32.143 --> 02:22:33.044
NEEDS OF THE RESIDENTS. THE

02:22:33.111 --> 02:22:35.246
SPECIFIC PLAN RETAINS LOCAL

02:22:35.313 --> 02:22:36.648
REVIEW AND DISCRETIONARY

02:22:36.714 --> 02:22:38.549
APPROVAL. WE ARE VITAL FOR

02:22:38.616 --> 02:22:40.351
ENSURING COMPATIBILITY WITH

02:22:40.418 --> 02:22:41.653
INFRASTRUCTURE, SERVICES AND THE

02:22:41.719 --> 02:22:42.854
NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. THE

02:22:42.921 --> 02:22:43.855
LOCAL COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND

02:22:43.922 --> 02:22:45.757
PLANNING IS ESSENTIAL TO

02:22:45.823 --> 02:22:47.225
PARAMOUNT, AND IT'S PRECISELY

02:22:47.292 --> 02:22:49.661
WHAT SB 79 WOULD ELIMINATE.

02:22:49.727 --> 02:22:51.195
WHILE WE SHARE THE GOAL OF

02:22:51.262 --> 02:22:52.931
CREATING MORE HOUSING NEAR

02:22:52.997 --> 02:22:53.665
TRANSIT, REMOVING LOCAL

02:22:53.731 --> 02:22:55.466
DISCRETION UNDERCUTS THE VERY

02:22:55.533 --> 02:22:56.567
APPROACH THAT HAS ALLOWED CITIES

02:22:56.634 --> 02:22:59.037
LIKE PARAMOUNT TO BE PROACTIVE,

02:22:59.103 --> 02:23:00.471
RESPONSIBLE, AND COMMUNITY

02:23:00.538 --> 02:23:01.839
FOCUSED IN PROMOTING TRANSIT

02:23:01.906 --> 02:23:04.042
ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT. I

02:23:04.108 --> 02:23:05.209
RESPECTFULLY ENCOURAGE THE

02:23:05.276 --> 02:23:07.712
COMMITTEE TO VOTE NO ON THE BILL

02:23:07.779 --> 02:23:09.414
BEFORE YOU TODAY. THANK YOU FOR

02:23:09.480 --> 02:23:12.684
YOUR TIME. THANK. I'M HERE FOR

02:23:12.750 --> 02:23:15.219
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THANK YOU.

02:23:15.286 --> 02:23:16.955
GOOD AFTERNOON, CHAIRMAN AND

02:23:17.021 --> 02:23:18.957

GONZALEZ AND I'M THE MAYOR OF

02:23:21.092 --> 02:23:22.560
THE CITY OF AZUSA. AZUSA IS A

02:23:22.627 --> 02:23:24.128
SMALL, DIVERSE CITY WITH A

02:23:24.195 --> 02:23:26.030
POPULATION JUST UNDER 50,000

02:23:26.097 --> 02:23:27.632
RESIDENTS. FOR YEARS, WE'VE BEEN

02:23:27.699 --> 02:23:29.334
IN THE FOREFRONT OF PROMOTING

02:23:29.400 --> 02:23:30.134
TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT IN

02:23:30.201 --> 02:23:32.103
A WAY THAT REFLECTS OUR

02:23:32.170 --> 02:23:34.105
COMMUNITY'S UNIQUE NEEDS.

02:23:34.172 --> 02:23:37.675
ADOPTED IN 2015 AND 2023,

02:23:37.742 --> 02:23:38.609

02:23:41.546 --> 02:23:43.014
HOUSING ELEMENT HAS ESTABLISHED

02:23:43.081 --> 02:23:46.150
A CLEAR, ACTIONABLE FRAMEWORK TO

02:23:46.217 --> 02:23:47.919
ENCOURAGE NEW HOUSING NEAR

02:23:47.986 --> 02:23:49.253
TRANSIT WHILE BALANCING

02:23:49.320 --> 02:23:50.855
INFRASTRUCTURE CAPACITY,

02:23:50.922 --> 02:23:52.724
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS, AND

02:23:52.790 --> 02:23:54.325
IMPORTANTLY, COMMUNITY SUPPORT.

02:23:54.392 --> 02:23:55.960
THESE PLANS WERE SHAPED OVER

02:23:56.027 --> 02:23:58.096
YEARS OF COLLABORATION WITH OUR

02:23:58.162 --> 02:23:59.497
RESIDENTS, STAKEHOLDERS AND

02:23:59.564 --> 02:24:01.232
STATE AGENCIES, AND THEY ARE

02:24:01.299 --> 02:24:03.368
DELIVERING RESULTS. IN JUST THE

02:24:03.434 --> 02:24:05.236
PAST FEW YEARS, AZUSA HAS

02:24:05.303 --> 02:24:07.438
APPROVED AND FACILITATED THE

02:24:07.505 --> 02:24:10.475
CONSTRUCTION OF 290 RESIDENTIAL

02:24:10.541 --> 02:24:14.879
UNITS AND 443,700FT² OF GROUND

02:24:14.946 --> 02:24:17.148
FLOOR COMMERCIAL SPACE WITHIN A

02:24:17.215 --> 02:24:19.984
QUARTER MILE OF OUR METRO Ã,

02:24:20.051 --> 02:24:21.853
FORMERLY THE GOAL LINE STATION.

02:24:21.919 --> 02:24:24.389
PROJECTS LIKE LUMIERE CONTRIBUTE

02:24:24.455 --> 02:24:27.025
TO 127 RESIDENTIAL UNITS, 12,000

02:24:27.091 --> 02:24:28.659
PLUS SQUARE FEET OF COMMERCIAL

02:24:28.726 --> 02:24:32.230
SPACE, WHILE THE ARCHER ADDED

02:24:32.296 --> 02:24:36.434
163 RESIDENTIAL UNITS AND

02:24:36.501 --> 02:24:38.336
31,000FT² OF COMMERCIAL SPACE,

02:24:38.403 --> 02:24:39.704
BRINGING BOTH HOUSING AND

02:24:39.771 --> 02:24:42.240
VIBRANT RETAIL ACTIVITY TO OUR

02:24:42.306 --> 02:24:45.209
DOWNTOWN. SB 79 WOULD UPEND

02:24:45.276 --> 02:24:47.045
THESE THOUGHTFUL, LOCALLY

02:24:47.111 --> 02:24:49.213
TAILORED EFFORTS WITH A BROAD,

02:24:49.280 --> 02:24:51.482
ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH BY

02:24:51.549 --> 02:24:52.784
FORCING CITIES TO REVISIT AND

02:24:52.850 --> 02:24:55.686
REDO ALREADY APPROVED HOUSING

02:24:55.753 --> 02:24:57.755
ELEMENTS, IT IMPOSES UNNECESSARY

02:24:57.822 --> 02:25:00.558
COSTS AND DELAYS AND UNDERMINES

02:25:00.625 --> 02:25:02.493
PUBLIC TRUST IN THE PLANNING

02:25:02.560 --> 02:25:04.028
PROCESS. IT SUGGESTS THAT OUR

02:25:04.095 --> 02:25:05.363
LOCALLY ADOPTED AND STATE

02:25:05.430 --> 02:25:07.465
APPROVED PLANS ARE SOMEHOW NOT

02:25:07.532 --> 02:25:10.034
ENOUGH. EVEN AS WE CONTINUE TO

02:25:10.101 --> 02:25:11.569
CONSISTENTLY WORK TOWARDS OUR

02:25:11.636 --> 02:25:14.839
FAIR SHARE OF HOUSING GOALS. THE

02:25:14.906 --> 02:25:16.874
BILL ALSO ALLOWS TRANSIT

02:25:16.941 --> 02:25:18.443
AGENCIES TO SET THEIR OWN

02:25:18.509 --> 02:25:20.111
DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS FOR

02:25:20.178 --> 02:25:21.612
COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL

02:25:21.679 --> 02:25:23.514
PROJECTS ON LAND THEY OWN OR

02:25:23.581 --> 02:25:26.017
CONTROL, WITHIN A HALF MILE OF

02:25:26.084 --> 02:25:26.918
TRANSIT, WITHOUT ANY

02:25:26.984 --> 02:25:28.419
REQUIREMENTS TO COORDINATE WITH

02:25:28.486 --> 02:25:30.288
LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR PROVIDE

02:25:30.354 --> 02:25:32.056
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THIS CREATES

02:25:32.123 --> 02:25:34.959
A TROUBLING SCENARIO WHERE

02:25:35.026 --> 02:25:37.528
CRITICAL LOCAL CONSIDERATIONS

02:25:37.595 --> 02:25:39.363
FROM INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE

02:25:39.430 --> 02:25:41.499
DISPLACEMENT RISKS ARE SIDELINED

02:25:41.566 --> 02:25:44.435
ENTIRELY. EXISTING HOUSING LAWS

02:25:44.502 --> 02:25:46.370
ALREADY EXIST, PROVIDING STRICT

02:25:46.437 --> 02:25:48.606
GUARDRAILS TO DRIVE PRODUCTION

02:25:48.673 --> 02:25:50.208
WITH CITIES LIKE AZUSA. NEED

02:25:50.274 --> 02:25:52.610
FROM THE STATE IS A PARTNER, ONE

02:25:52.677 --> 02:25:55.079
THAT EMPOWERS US TO GUIDE

02:25:55.146 --> 02:25:56.848
DEVELOPMENT IN WAYS THAT FIT OUR

02:25:56.914 --> 02:25:58.983
COMMUNITIES, FOSTER CAPABILITY

02:25:59.050 --> 02:26:02.019
AND SUSTAINED PROGRESS WITHOUT

02:26:02.086 --> 02:26:04.755
UNINTENDED HARM. A BROAD BRUSH

02:26:04.822 --> 02:26:06.491
APPROACH MAY SEEM EFFICIENT, BUT

02:26:06.557 --> 02:26:08.326
IS WITHOUT TOUCH WITH THE

02:26:08.392 --> 02:26:09.894
DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CITIES

02:26:09.961 --> 02:26:12.063
AND THE REALITIES ON THE GROUND.

02:26:12.130 --> 02:26:14.232
I URGE YOU TO RECOGNIZE THE

02:26:14.298 --> 02:26:15.633
PROGRESS WITH CITIES LIKE AZUSA

02:26:15.700 --> 02:26:17.368
THAT HAVE MADE IN SUPPORT

02:26:17.435 --> 02:26:19.537
POLICIES THAT STRENGTHEN, NOT

02:26:19.604 --> 02:26:21.472
SIDELINED, COMMUNITY DRIVEN,

02:26:21.539 --> 02:26:23.941
TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT.

02:26:24.008 --> 02:26:26.477

ENCOURAGE THIS COMMITTEE TO VOTE

02:26:34.152 --> 02:26:36.487

THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT HAVE BEEN

02:29:59.724 --> 02:30:01.726
ABLE TO COME OUT TO TALK ABOUT

02:30:01.792 --> 02:30:03.327
THIS TODAY, FOR THE SENATOR, FOR

02:30:03.394 --> 02:30:05.229
THINKING BOLD ABOUT MORE HOUSING

02:30:05.296 --> 02:30:06.030
SOLUTIONS, THAT I KNOW THAT WE

02:30:06.097 --> 02:30:08.366
NEED A CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT THIS

02:30:08.432 --> 02:30:10.134
A LOT AT THE HOUSING COMMUNITY

02:30:10.201 --> 02:30:11.535
DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE. SO I

02:30:11.602 --> 02:30:12.403
WON'T GO ON A TERRIBLE LENGTH.

02:30:12.470 --> 02:30:14.171
BUT, YOU KNOW, EVEN OVER THE

02:30:14.238 --> 02:30:16.340
LAST WEEK, YOU KNOW, THIS

02:30:16.407 --> 02:30:16.941
CONTINUES TO BE A VERY HIGH

02:30:17.007 --> 02:30:18.242
PROFILE LINE OF DISCUSSION BACK

02:30:18.309 --> 02:30:20.378
HOME IN ALL OF OUR HOMES. AND SO

02:30:20.444 --> 02:30:22.847
I TAKE A LOT OF THAT INPUT VERY

02:30:22.913 --> 02:30:25.383
SERIOUSLY, BECAUSE I THINK

02:30:25.449 --> 02:30:27.918
OVERALL, WE KNOW THAT WHAT WE'RE

02:30:27.985 --> 02:30:29.887
TRYING TO DO HERE, TO YOUR POINT

02:30:29.954 --> 02:30:31.389
OF NEEDING TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

02:30:31.455 --> 02:30:33.023
MORE HOUSING, REALLY COMES IN

02:30:33.090 --> 02:30:35.025
ONE OF THREE LARGE BUCKETS. YOU

02:30:35.092 --> 02:30:37.628
CAN FOCUS ON SOLUTIONS THAT ARE

02:30:37.695 --> 02:30:38.262
GOING TO BETTER CONNECT TRANSIT

02:30:38.329 --> 02:30:38.996
AND HOUSING, CREATE TRANSIT

02:30:39.063 --> 02:30:41.031
ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT. THIS IS

02:30:41.098 --> 02:30:42.666
ONE A VERY SIGNIFICANT ONE

02:30:42.733 --> 02:30:43.834
EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

02:30:43.901 --> 02:30:45.836
DO ON THAT FRONT. YOU CAN LOOK

02:30:45.903 --> 02:30:46.704
AT AREAS THAT ARE EXPANDING,

02:30:46.771 --> 02:30:48.672
MORE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES

02:30:48.739 --> 02:30:50.141
THROUGHOUT OTHER KINDS OF

02:30:50.207 --> 02:30:51.208
LANDSCAPES, THINK ABOUT ADUS,

02:30:51.275 --> 02:30:52.676
THINK ABOUT OTHER SOLUTIONS THAT

02:30:52.743 --> 02:30:54.645
ARE GETTING INTO SINGLE FAMILY

02:30:54.712 --> 02:30:55.713
NEIGHBORHOODS. AND THAT'S ALL

02:30:55.780 --> 02:30:56.447
TOUCHING EXISTING ENVIRONMENT.

02:30:56.514 --> 02:30:57.848
AND THEN YOU HAVE SPRAWL, AND

02:30:57.915 --> 02:30:59.150
THEN YOU CAN CREATE NEW

02:30:59.216 --> 02:30:59.884
COMMUNITIES AND YOU CAN GO

02:30:59.950 --> 02:31:02.052
FARTHER OUT. AND SO THAT CAN BE

02:31:02.119 --> 02:31:03.988
A LITTLE BIT CHEAPER ON THE

02:31:04.054 --> 02:31:05.823
FRONT END, PROBABLY A LOT MORE

02:31:05.890 --> 02:31:06.824
EXPENSIVE OVER THE LONG RUN, BUT

02:31:06.891 --> 02:31:08.225
ALSO HAS ITS SERIES OF SETBACKS

02:31:08.292 --> 02:31:09.860
AND EVERYTHING. SO I SEE THAT

02:31:09.927 --> 02:31:11.829
YOU'RE TRYING TO TACKLE ONE OF

02:31:11.896 --> 02:31:12.496
THOSE KINDS OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR

02:31:12.563 --> 02:31:14.598
OUR GROWTH, BUT LOOKING SO IN A

02:31:14.665 --> 02:31:15.866
WAY THAT IS CLIMATE, PROBABLY

02:31:15.933 --> 02:31:17.868
THE MOST CLIMATE FRIENDLY, BUT

02:31:17.935 --> 02:31:19.703
ALSO AN IMPORTANTLY, IS ACTUALLY

02:31:19.770 --> 02:31:22.239
CONNECTING IT TO TRANSIT, WHERE

02:31:22.306 --> 02:31:24.408
WE HAVE THIS CHICKEN AND EGG

02:31:24.475 --> 02:31:25.843
CONVERSATION. WE HAVE THIS

02:31:25.910 --> 02:31:27.411
ONGOING CONVERSATION IN MANY OF

02:31:27.478 --> 02:31:28.212
OUR COMMUNITIES THAT TRANSIT

02:31:28.279 --> 02:31:29.713
DOESN'T WORK OR IT'S NEVER GOING

02:31:29.780 --> 02:31:32.216
TO WORK. AND WE KNOW WE NEED THE

02:31:32.283 --> 02:31:33.951
RIDERSHIP, AND WE KNOW WE NEED

02:31:34.018 --> 02:31:34.785
PEOPLE TO BE CLOSE TO THAT

02:31:34.852 --> 02:31:37.021
RIDERSHIP. AND SO WHEN WE ARE SO

02:31:37.087 --> 02:31:38.556
FORTUNATE TO BE ABLE TO FIND

02:31:38.622 --> 02:31:40.024
WAYS TO MAKE PUBLIC INVESTMENTS

02:31:40.090 --> 02:31:41.058
IN A NEW TRANSIT LINE OR A NEW

02:31:41.125 --> 02:31:41.959
HIGH CAPACITY OPPORTUNITIES TO

02:31:42.026 --> 02:31:43.861
GET PEOPLE AROUND A LITTLE BIT

02:31:43.928 --> 02:31:46.063
BETTER, WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

02:31:46.130 --> 02:31:46.664
IT'S WORKING FOR THOSE PEOPLE,

02:31:46.730 --> 02:31:49.033
AND THAT HAS TO BE CLOSE TO

02:31:49.099 --> 02:31:49.667
WHERE THEY LIVE AND WHERE THEY

02:31:49.733 --> 02:31:50.868
WORK, AND WHERE THEY WANT TO GO

02:31:50.935 --> 02:31:53.103
OUT FOR DINNER AND EVERYTHING

02:31:53.170 --> 02:31:54.071
ELSE. AND SO YOU ARE AFFECTING

02:31:54.138 --> 02:31:55.873
AN EXISTING ENVIRONMENT. THAT'S

02:31:55.940 --> 02:31:56.974
A FUNDAMENTAL HERE. AND I THINK

02:31:57.041 --> 02:31:58.576
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE

02:31:58.642 --> 02:32:00.478
WITH 79 IS SORT OF LOOK AT

02:32:00.544 --> 02:32:01.812
CONCEPTUALLY WHAT WOULD BE SORT

02:32:01.879 --> 02:32:05.082
OF THAT BROAD AND MINIMUM

02:32:05.149 --> 02:32:06.851
DENSITY CAPACITY THAT YOU WOULD

02:32:06.917 --> 02:32:09.854
WANT TO SEE AROUND WHAT WE'RE

02:32:09.920 --> 02:32:11.021
DEFINING AS A TIER ONE OR TIER

02:32:11.088 --> 02:32:13.390
TWO OR TIER THREE STYLE TRANSIT

02:32:13.457 --> 02:32:14.859
INFRASTRUCTURE LINE. RIGHT. THAT

02:32:14.925 --> 02:32:15.893
PROBABLY ALIGNS WITH DIFFERENT

02:32:15.960 --> 02:32:16.927
CAPACITIES, DIFFERENT

02:32:16.994 --> 02:32:17.795
FREQUENCIES. AND SO THAT SHOULD

02:32:17.862 --> 02:32:19.864
ALIGN WITH GREATER INTENSITIES.

02:32:19.930 --> 02:32:21.065
AND THE MORE PEOPLE YOU WON'T

02:32:21.131 --> 02:32:22.032
PLACE CLOSE TO THAT. SO THAT'S

02:32:22.099 --> 02:32:23.801
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE.

02:32:23.868 --> 02:32:25.002
SO NOW THE RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD

02:32:25.069 --> 02:32:26.904
AND YOU WANT TO PLOP THAT CIRCLE

02:32:26.971 --> 02:32:28.138
OR THESE CONCENTRIC CIRCLES INTO

02:32:28.205 --> 02:32:29.974
AN EXISTING COMMUNITY. AND THEN

02:32:30.040 --> 02:32:30.641
WE RUN AGAINST IMPORTANT

02:32:30.708 --> 02:32:31.876
CONVERSATIONS HERE ABOUT WHAT IT

02:32:31.942 --> 02:32:33.844
LOOKS LIKE HERE AND WHAT CAN AND

02:32:33.911 --> 02:32:34.879
CAN'T WORK. AND THAT, I THINK,

02:32:34.945 --> 02:32:36.080
IS A CENTRAL TENSION HERE,

02:32:36.146 --> 02:32:38.482
RIGHT, IS THAT WE WANT MAYBE A

02:32:38.549 --> 02:32:40.284
VISION 20 OR 50 NOW FOR TRANSIT

02:32:40.351 --> 02:32:42.586
TO WORK, FOR MORE PEOPLE TO BE

02:32:42.653 --> 02:32:44.188
ABLE TO SHIFT THERE. AND WE KNOW

02:32:44.255 --> 02:32:45.756
THAT WE HAVE TO CONNECT THESE

02:32:45.823 --> 02:32:46.957
DOTS, AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

02:32:47.024 --> 02:32:49.093
GO THROUGH THOSE GROWING PAINS.

02:32:49.159 --> 02:32:49.960
CAN WE GO THROUGH THOSE GROWING

02:32:50.027 --> 02:32:50.961
PAINS AND PARTNERSHIP JUST TO

02:32:51.028 --> 02:32:52.963
SAY, NO? AND THIS WILL NEVER

02:32:53.030 --> 02:32:53.898
HAPPEN. WELL, IN 50 YEARS THIS

02:32:53.964 --> 02:32:55.900
WILL NEVER HAPPEN. BUT CAN WE

02:32:55.966 --> 02:32:57.334
SET THAT MINIMUM THRESHOLD? AND

02:32:57.401 --> 02:32:58.736
I LOOK AT 70 SB 79 AS THAT

02:32:58.802 --> 02:33:00.871
VEHICLE TO BE ABLE TO DO SO. AND

02:33:00.938 --> 02:33:02.573
SO SOME QUESTIONS THAT HAVE COME

02:33:02.640 --> 02:33:03.974
UP AS WELL. I JUST WANTED TO

02:33:04.041 --> 02:33:05.943
ALSO UNDERSCORE AND GET ON THE

02:33:06.010 --> 02:33:07.811
RECORD. AND I THINK YOU ALREADY

02:33:07.878 --> 02:33:09.046
HAVE A SOLUTION HERE THAT MANY

02:33:09.113 --> 02:33:09.980
AREN'T FULLY APPRECIATING THAT I

02:33:10.047 --> 02:33:11.882
ALSO WANTED TO TEASE INTO AS

02:33:11.949 --> 02:33:13.918
WELL. YOU KNOW, IN SAN DIEGO, WE

02:33:13.984 --> 02:33:14.451
HAVE A SERIES OF CANYON

02:33:14.518 --> 02:33:15.619
NETWORKS, AND IT'S JUST IT'S A

02:33:15.686 --> 02:33:16.754
VERY TOPOGRAPHICALLY CHALLENGED

02:33:16.820 --> 02:33:18.255
AREA. AND I KNOW YOU'VE ALREADY

02:33:18.322 --> 02:33:19.924
TAKEN AN AMENDMENT HERE AS WELL.

02:33:19.990 --> 02:33:20.791
WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT PATH

02:33:20.858 --> 02:33:22.693
TO TRAVEL VERSUS HOW AS THE CROW

02:33:22.760 --> 02:33:23.928
FLIES AND WHETHER THAT RADIUS IS

02:33:23.994 --> 02:33:25.563
GOING TO APPLY TO SUBJECT

02:33:25.629 --> 02:33:26.330
PARCELS. THAT'S CORRECT. WE SO

02:33:26.397 --> 02:33:28.165
WE AMENDED THE BILL SO THAT

02:33:28.232 --> 02:33:29.800
BECAUSE WE HAVE A HALF MILE, BUT

02:33:29.867 --> 02:33:31.869
YOU COULD HAVE A HALF MILE THAT

02:33:31.936 --> 02:33:33.203
CROSSES OVER A FREEWAY OR

02:33:33.270 --> 02:33:35.172
CROSSES OVER A CANYON OR CROSSES

02:33:35.239 --> 02:33:40.477
OVER A BODY OF WATER AND, AND SO

02:33:40.544 --> 02:33:41.979
WE PUT AN AMENDMENT, EXCUSE ME.

02:33:42.046 --> 02:33:43.147
THAT'S NOT REASONABLE. PARCELS

02:33:43.213 --> 02:33:45.316
ON THE OTHER SIDE ARE NO LONGER

02:33:45.382 --> 02:33:46.317
TRANSIT ORIENTED. EXACTLY. SO WE

02:33:46.383 --> 02:33:47.718
PUT AN AMENDMENT THAT IF YOU

02:33:47.785 --> 02:33:49.053
CAN'T, IF IT'S IF IT'S BEYOND A

02:33:49.119 --> 02:33:50.287
CERTAIN DISTANCE OF WALKING

02:33:50.354 --> 02:33:52.389
BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT, I

02:33:52.456 --> 02:33:53.857
THINK WE DID A MILE. IF IT'S IF

02:33:53.924 --> 02:33:55.893
IT TAKES MORE THAN A MILE TO

02:33:55.960 --> 02:33:57.695
WALK THERE, THEN THE CITY HAS

02:33:57.761 --> 02:33:58.829
THE ABILITY TO JUST REMOVE IT

02:33:58.896 --> 02:34:01.398
FROM THE BILL ENTIRELY. AND SO

02:34:01.465 --> 02:34:02.800
WE PUT THAT FLEXIBILITY. THEY

02:34:02.866 --> 02:34:04.301
DON'T HAVE TO. THE CITY MIGHT

02:34:04.368 --> 02:34:05.836
CHOOSE THAT THEY WANT TO KEEP

02:34:05.903 --> 02:34:07.838
IT, BUT THEY ALL HAVE THAT

02:34:07.905 --> 02:34:09.340
DECISION. FIRE HAZARDS COME UP A

02:34:09.406 --> 02:34:10.941
LOT. AND SO, YOU KNOW, IF YOU

02:34:11.008 --> 02:34:14.745
HAVE A ESPECIALLY TERRITORY IN

02:34:14.812 --> 02:34:17.548
THESE BUBBLES THAT ARE IN HIGH

02:34:17.615 --> 02:34:19.350
FIRE HAZARD AREAS THAT MIGHT

02:34:19.416 --> 02:34:20.851
HAVE AN EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE,

02:34:20.918 --> 02:34:22.252
EXISTING NETWORK, RIGHT, THAT

02:34:22.319 --> 02:34:24.054
HAS THE CAPACITY THAT IT DOES TO

02:34:24.121 --> 02:34:26.056
MOVE CARS, TO MOVE PEOPLE IN AND

02:34:26.123 --> 02:34:29.026
AROUND AND GET OUT. HOW MIGHT

02:34:29.093 --> 02:34:30.427
THAT ACTUALLY BE ACCOMMODATED

02:34:30.494 --> 02:34:34.098
HERE? SO THIS THE BILL DOES NOT

02:34:34.164 --> 02:34:36.900
IN ANY WAY SCALE BACK THE RULES

02:34:36.967 --> 02:34:38.702
THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE FOR

02:34:38.769 --> 02:34:40.371
THESE. FOR EXAMPLE, IF WE TALK

02:34:40.437 --> 02:34:41.572
ABOUT VERY HIGH WILDFIRE

02:34:41.639 --> 02:34:44.508
SEVERITY ZONE RIGHT NOW, IF YOU

02:34:44.575 --> 02:34:46.777
ARE BUILDING IN A HIGH IN ONE OF

02:34:46.844 --> 02:34:48.779
THOSE ZONES, THERE ARE SOME VERY

02:34:48.846 --> 02:34:50.447
STRINGENT RULES THAT YOU HAVE TO

02:34:50.514 --> 02:34:51.949
MEET IN TERMS OF INGRESS AND

02:34:52.016 --> 02:34:53.784
EGRESS, DEFENSIBLE SPACE,

02:34:53.851 --> 02:34:57.521
BUILDING MATERIALS, ETC. AND IN

02:34:57.588 --> 02:35:01.225
SB 423, WHICH IS, BUILDERS CAN

02:35:01.291 --> 02:35:03.861
INVOKE SB 423 TO DO

02:35:03.927 --> 02:35:05.129
STREAMLINING. THEY HAVE THAT

02:35:05.195 --> 02:35:07.931
CHOICE. UNDER SB 79. WE ACTUALLY

02:35:07.998 --> 02:35:10.868
PUT A THERE'S A VERY DETAILED

02:35:10.934 --> 02:35:14.038
PROVISION FOR REQUIREMENTS IN

02:35:14.104 --> 02:35:16.573
THOSE HIGH WILDFIRE SEVERITY

02:35:16.640 --> 02:35:19.009
ZONES. AND THEN IF YOU DON'T USE

02:35:19.076 --> 02:35:19.943
SB 423, THEN YOU'RE GOING

02:35:20.010 --> 02:35:21.645
THROUGH THE NORMAL PROCESS,

02:35:21.712 --> 02:35:23.347
WHICH, YOU KNOW, CITIES HAVE THE

02:35:23.414 --> 02:35:25.883
ABILITY TO DO A LOT OF DIFFERENT

02:35:25.949 --> 02:35:27.685
THINGS IN THAT PROCESS. SO THE

02:35:27.751 --> 02:35:30.320
BILL DOES ACCOUNT FOR THAT KIND

02:35:30.387 --> 02:35:32.256
OF SITUATION RELATED TO THAT.

02:35:32.322 --> 02:35:33.891
BUT LESS TALKED ABOUT BUT

02:35:33.957 --> 02:35:35.726
IMPORTANT IS EXISTING

02:35:35.793 --> 02:35:36.627
INFRASTRUCTURE, THE PIPES UNDER

02:35:36.694 --> 02:35:38.295
THE GROUND, THE, YOU KNOW,

02:35:38.362 --> 02:35:40.297
CAPACITY OF MAYBE AN ON STREET

02:35:40.364 --> 02:35:40.931
NETWORK, OTHER THINGS THAT WE'RE

02:35:40.998 --> 02:35:43.033
THINKING ABOUT IF HOW CAN THAT

02:35:43.100 --> 02:35:46.570
BE ACCOMMODATED AS WELL. SO THIS

02:35:46.637 --> 02:35:50.441
IS THE PERMANENT DISCUSSION THAT

02:35:50.507 --> 02:35:52.009
WE ALWAYS HAVE WHEN IT COMES TO

02:35:52.076 --> 02:35:54.111
HOUSING. WE ALL KNOW THAT WE

02:35:54.178 --> 02:35:55.979
NEED HOUSING AND WE NEED

02:35:56.046 --> 02:35:56.714
INFRASTRUCTURE. WE NEED BOTH.

02:35:56.780 --> 02:35:57.981
THEY'RE BOTH INCREDIBLY

02:35:58.048 --> 02:35:59.883
IMPORTANT. IF YOU LOOK AT HOW

02:35:59.950 --> 02:36:00.517
COMMUNITIES DEVELOP THROUGHOUT

02:36:00.584 --> 02:36:02.686
THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD, IT

02:36:02.753 --> 02:36:04.822
DOESN'T ALWAYS MOVE PERFECTLY

02:36:04.888 --> 02:36:06.123
TOGETHER. SOMETIMES YOU HOUSING

02:36:06.190 --> 02:36:07.691
AND THEN THAT CREATES DEMAND FOR

02:36:07.758 --> 02:36:09.226
INFRASTRUCTURE. SO YOU BUILD

02:36:09.293 --> 02:36:11.762
INFRASTRUCTURE. AND SO IT IS

02:36:11.829 --> 02:36:12.663
IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT

02:36:12.730 --> 02:36:13.664
INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS BILL A

02:36:13.731 --> 02:36:15.833
COUPLE OF THINGS DOES NOT TAKE

02:36:15.899 --> 02:36:17.701
AWAY ANYTHING ABOUT IMPACT FEES

02:36:17.768 --> 02:36:20.070
OR EXACTIONS THE CITY PUT ON

02:36:20.137 --> 02:36:21.138
DEVELOPMENT. WE DO NOT TOUCH

02:36:21.205 --> 02:36:23.674
THAT OR OVERRIDE THAT IN ANY

02:36:23.741 --> 02:36:27.111
WAY. IN ADDITION, THIS BILL, AS

02:36:27.177 --> 02:36:28.946
I MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING,

02:36:29.012 --> 02:36:31.381
GIVES CITIES THE ABILITY TO DO A

02:36:31.448 --> 02:36:32.950
LOCAL FLEXIBILITY PLAN IF THEY

02:36:33.016 --> 02:36:35.919
WANT TO DE-EMPHASIZE. IF YOU

02:36:35.986 --> 02:36:37.654
LOOK AT THE CIRCLE AROUND THE

02:36:37.721 --> 02:36:39.022
TRANSIT STATION FOR HALF MILE,

02:36:39.089 --> 02:36:41.058
IF THEY WANT TO DE-EMPHASIZE ONE

02:36:41.125 --> 02:36:43.060
AREA AND EMPHASIZE ANOTHER AREA

02:36:43.127 --> 02:36:44.928
MORE, THEY CAN DO THAT. AND THEY

02:36:44.995 --> 02:36:46.130
CAN DO THAT BECAUSE, FOR

02:36:46.196 --> 02:36:47.898
EXAMPLE, THIS IS AN AREA THAT'S

02:36:47.965 --> 02:36:49.767
MORE FIRE PRONE. SO WE WANT TO

02:36:49.833 --> 02:36:51.135
DE-EMPHASIZE THAT AREA. THIS

02:36:51.201 --> 02:36:52.402
AREA IS LESS FIRE PRONE. WE'RE

02:36:52.469 --> 02:36:54.004
GOING TO PUT MORE THERE OR

02:36:54.071 --> 02:36:55.639
THERE'S BETTER SEWER SERVICE

02:36:55.706 --> 02:36:58.442
OVER HERE. SO WE'RE GOING TO PUT

02:36:58.509 --> 02:36:59.042
WE'RE GOING TO OVEREMPHASIZE

02:36:59.109 --> 02:37:00.577
THIS AREA AND DE-EMPHASIZE THE

02:37:00.644 --> 02:37:02.279
AREA WHERE WE WOULD HAVE TO DO

02:37:02.346 --> 02:37:03.981
MORE SEWER UPGRADES. WE GIVE

02:37:04.047 --> 02:37:05.349
CITIES THE ABILITY TO FORMULATE

02:37:05.415 --> 02:37:07.251
THOSE ALTERNATIVE PLANS. THAT

02:37:07.317 --> 02:37:09.987
WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME WHEN WE

02:37:10.053 --> 02:37:12.489
INTRODUCED THE BILL. THAT WAS

02:37:12.556 --> 02:37:13.857
IMPORTANT TO ME TO INCLUDE IT,

02:37:13.924 --> 02:37:15.626
AND WE'VE MADE IT MORE AND MORE

02:37:15.692 --> 02:37:17.394
ROBUST SINCE WE INTRODUCED IT. I

02:37:17.461 --> 02:37:19.863
WANT IT TO BE EASY FOR CITIES TO

02:37:19.930 --> 02:37:21.698
USE. IT IS NOT. THIS BILL IS NOT

02:37:21.765 --> 02:37:23.167
A ONE SIZE FITS ALL WITH ALL

02:37:23.233 --> 02:37:24.935
RESPECT, BECAUSE CITIES HAVE THE

02:37:25.002 --> 02:37:26.837
ABILITY TO BE FLEXIBLE AROUND

02:37:26.904 --> 02:37:28.906
IT. SO I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT THAT

02:37:28.972 --> 02:37:29.973
UP, BECAUSE I DEFINITELY WANTED

02:37:30.040 --> 02:37:30.908
TO ALSO UNDERSCORE SOMETHING

02:37:30.974 --> 02:37:32.075
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT OVER THE

02:37:32.142 --> 02:37:33.977
COURSE OF THIS LAST WEEK IS THE

02:37:34.044 --> 02:37:35.813
WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE AND THE

02:37:35.879 --> 02:37:36.480
AMENDMENTS YOU'VE ALREADY TAKEN.

02:37:36.547 --> 02:37:38.115
AND I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO

02:37:38.182 --> 02:37:39.449
REALLY CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO

02:37:39.516 --> 02:37:40.884
IMPROVE UPON IN THE ABILITY, AND

02:37:40.951 --> 02:37:42.553
THIS ACTUALLY COMES RIGHT BACK

02:37:42.619 --> 02:37:44.421
TO INTERSECT WITH LOCAL

02:37:44.488 --> 02:37:45.088
GOVERNMENTS INTERESTS, THAT YOU

02:37:45.155 --> 02:37:46.156
ACTUALLY DO HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY

02:37:46.223 --> 02:37:46.824
HERE. THIS ACTUALLY MAY

02:37:46.890 --> 02:37:47.958
INCENTIVIZE EVERYBODY IF THEY

02:37:48.025 --> 02:37:50.027
ARE SUBJECT TO AN SP 79 LOCATION

02:37:50.093 --> 02:37:51.929
BECAUSE OF THAT TRANSIT TRIGGER,

02:37:51.995 --> 02:37:53.130
THAT YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:37:53.197 --> 02:37:53.997
STILL BE ABLE TO WEIGH IN AND BE

02:37:54.064 --> 02:37:56.934
ABLE TO DESIGN THAT IN A WAY

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:57.935
THAT ULTIMATELY, AND I THINK TO

02:37:58.001 --> 02:37:59.770
THE POINT IN THE AMENDMENTS

02:37:59.837 --> 02:38:00.971
HERE, IS STILL GOING TO BE ABLE

02:38:01.038 --> 02:38:02.706
TO MEET THE KIND OF CAPACITY

02:38:02.773 --> 02:38:04.708
THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT TO BE ABLE

02:38:04.775 --> 02:38:06.210
TO SERVE OR BE ABLE TO RELATE TO

02:38:06.276 --> 02:38:07.778
THAT TRANSIT NODE. AND THERE ARE

02:38:07.845 --> 02:38:09.746
WAYS THAT YOU CAN SHIFT THINGS

02:38:09.813 --> 02:38:10.547
AROUND. I MIGHT OFFER AS WELL,

02:38:10.614 --> 02:38:12.382
IN ADDITION TO SOME OF THE

02:38:12.449 --> 02:38:13.083
CRITERIA THAT YOU'RE LOOKING

02:38:13.150 --> 02:38:14.718
HERE THAT WOULD GO INTO THAT

02:38:14.785 --> 02:38:17.187
KIND OF A PLAN THAT CAN BE

02:38:17.254 --> 02:38:17.788
ADOPTED THROUGH YOUR HOUSING

02:38:17.855 --> 02:38:18.522
ELEMENT, THROUGH ZONING

02:38:18.589 --> 02:38:19.523
ORDINANCE, THROUGH A PLAN

02:38:19.590 --> 02:38:20.958
SUBMITTED TO HCD. THERE'S

02:38:21.024 --> 02:38:21.859
MULTIPLE WAYS I THINK THIS CAN

02:38:21.925 --> 02:38:23.827
BE SATISFIED THAT YOU ONE YOU DO

02:38:23.894 --> 02:38:24.628
MENTION HERE THAT THAT NO PARCEL

02:38:24.695 --> 02:38:26.530
OR NO FEATURE DEVELOPMENT WITHIN

02:38:26.597 --> 02:38:28.465
THAT AREA WOULD BE ABLE TO BE

02:38:28.532 --> 02:38:29.800
REDUCED BY MORE THAN 50%, EVEN

02:38:29.867 --> 02:38:30.400
THOUGH YOU'RE SHIFTING SOME

02:38:30.467 --> 02:38:31.802
THINGS AWAY, THAT MIGHT NOT BE A

02:38:31.869 --> 02:38:33.537
APPROPRIATE LIMIT. THERE MIGHT

02:38:33.604 --> 02:38:35.672
BE EVEN FURTHER CONSTRAINTS THAT

02:38:35.739 --> 02:38:37.207
WOULD NECESSITATE, RATIONALLY,

02:38:37.274 --> 02:38:38.742
THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO BE ABLE

02:38:38.809 --> 02:38:40.043
TO SHIFT THINGS FURTHER. AND

02:38:40.110 --> 02:38:41.845
THAT'S GOING TO SHIFT SOMETHING

02:38:41.912 --> 02:38:42.479
THAT THAT DEVELOPMENT. RIGHT.

02:38:42.546 --> 02:38:43.680
SO, YOU KNOW, EVEN FURTHER

02:38:43.747 --> 02:38:44.815
SOMEWHERE ELSE. BUT YOU JUST I

02:38:44.882 --> 02:38:47.317
THINK WOULD WANT TO BE A LITTLE

02:38:47.384 --> 02:38:48.285
BIT MORE KIND OF FLEXIBLE THERE.

02:38:48.352 --> 02:38:49.019
YEAH. AND WE'RE WE'RE REMAIN

02:38:49.086 --> 02:38:51.521
VERY OPEN TO DIFFERENT IDEAS AND

02:38:51.588 --> 02:38:53.290
WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE THOSE

02:38:53.357 --> 02:38:54.057
CONVERSATIONS. AND I'LL, I'LL

02:38:54.124 --> 02:38:55.492
KEEP HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS

02:38:55.559 --> 02:38:57.094
WITH YOU. I'D ALSO, YOU KNOW,

02:38:57.160 --> 02:39:02.499
LIKE TO AT A LATER TIME, GO INTO

02:39:02.566 --> 02:39:04.801
A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT AREAS

02:39:04.868 --> 02:39:05.369
THAT HAVE PLANNED DISTRICT

02:39:05.435 --> 02:39:06.036
ORDINANCES. SO PLANNED DISTRICT

02:39:06.103 --> 02:39:06.970
ORDINANCES, A VERY SPECIALIZED

02:39:07.037 --> 02:39:08.805
TYPE. BUT, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING

02:39:08.872 --> 02:39:10.641
THAT IS NOT UNCOMMON THROUGHOUT

02:39:10.707 --> 02:39:11.275
CALIFORNIA CITIES. I'M SURE OUR

02:39:11.341 --> 02:39:11.909
CITY REPRESENTATIVES KNOW ABOUT

02:39:11.975 --> 02:39:14.378
THESE TOO. I'VE GOT TWO THAT ARE

02:39:14.444 --> 02:39:14.978
VERY SPECIAL IN MY AREA OLD

02:39:15.045 --> 02:39:17.714
TOWN, THE BIRTH OF CALIFORNIA,

02:39:17.781 --> 02:39:18.548
THE BIRTH OF SAN DIEGO THAT I

02:39:18.615 --> 02:39:20.984
THINK RATIONALLY IS A SPECIAL

02:39:21.051 --> 02:39:22.819
AREA THAT YOU WOULD NOT WANT TO

02:39:22.886 --> 02:39:25.122
CHANGE. A LOT OF THAT

02:39:25.188 --> 02:39:28.558
REMEMBRANCE OF THE 1850S. AND

02:39:28.625 --> 02:39:29.726
THAT IS REALLY EMBEDDED IN THE

02:39:29.793 --> 02:39:31.528
DESIGN STANDARDS AND WHAT WE

02:39:31.595 --> 02:39:33.630
HAVE IN THERE. BUT IT IS RIGHT

02:39:33.697 --> 02:39:34.798
NEXT TO, OF COURSE, THE LARGEST

02:39:34.865 --> 02:39:36.867
TRANSIT CENTER THAT WE HAVE IN

02:39:36.934 --> 02:39:38.001
THE AREA AS WELL. CAN WE SATISFY

02:39:38.068 --> 02:39:39.970
BOTH WHERE WE ARE ABLE TO SHIFT

02:39:40.037 --> 02:39:41.872
AROUND INTO AREAS THAT ARE GOING

02:39:41.939 --> 02:39:42.773
TO BUT NOT HAVE THAT? THAT'S

02:39:42.839 --> 02:39:44.007
WHERE THE 50% RULE IS LIKE

02:39:44.074 --> 02:39:46.043
COMING INTO PLAY. AND ALSO

02:39:46.109 --> 02:39:46.677
GASLAMP IN DOWNTOWN WOULD BE

02:39:46.743 --> 02:39:49.146
SUBJECT TO AN SB 79 ZONE. BUT

02:39:49.212 --> 02:39:50.314
AGAIN, THAT'S GOT ITS OWN

02:39:50.380 --> 02:39:51.949
SPECIAL HISTORICAL DISTRICT AND

02:39:52.015 --> 02:39:53.216
HISTORICAL CHARACTER, ALL THINGS

02:39:53.283 --> 02:39:54.918
THAT STILL NEED TO BE THOUGHT

02:39:54.985 --> 02:39:56.687
THROUGH. AS YOU WORK ON THIS

02:39:56.753 --> 02:39:58.055
OVER THE SUMMER, I THINK YOU'RE

02:39:58.121 --> 02:39:59.356
HEADED TOWARDS SOMETHING THAT

02:39:59.423 --> 02:40:00.490
COULD BE VERY TRANSFORMATIONAL,

02:40:00.557 --> 02:40:01.258
BUT WE CAN'T BE DISRESPECTFUL OF

02:40:01.325 --> 02:40:03.193
A LOT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION

02:40:03.260 --> 02:40:04.261
EFFORTS BECAUSE THAT WILL MAKE

02:40:04.328 --> 02:40:07.497
THIS WORK WELL AND IT WILL

02:40:07.564 --> 02:40:08.799
SATISFY, I THINK, WHAT WE'RE

02:40:08.865 --> 02:40:10.701
TRYING TO DO TO BE ABLE TO

02:40:10.767 --> 02:40:12.436
PROVIDE THE CAPACITY WHERE WE

02:40:12.502 --> 02:40:13.704
WANT TO HAVE IT FOR ALL THE

02:40:13.770 --> 02:40:14.671
RIGHT REASONS, ON OUR FUTURE AND

02:40:14.738 --> 02:40:16.873
ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND ON

02:40:16.940 --> 02:40:18.775
LIVABILITY. AND SO I'D LIKE TO

02:40:18.842 --> 02:40:20.477
BE ABLE TO SEE THIS MOVE

02:40:20.544 --> 02:40:22.446
FORWARD. I RECOGNIZE THE

02:40:22.512 --> 02:40:23.080
PROGRESS THAT YOU'VE DONE HERE

02:40:23.146 --> 02:40:24.348
ON MANY OF THESE VERY SPECIFIC

02:40:24.414 --> 02:40:25.782
REQUIREMENTS ON MAINTAINING

02:40:25.849 --> 02:40:27.017
INCLUSIONARY INTERESTS AND

02:40:27.084 --> 02:40:28.185
AFFORDABILITY ISSUES, AND

02:40:28.251 --> 02:40:30.554
WORKING WITH MANY OF OUR

02:40:30.620 --> 02:40:31.521
COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND

02:40:31.588 --> 02:40:33.857
ORGANIZATIONS THAT CARE ABOUT

02:40:33.924 --> 02:40:35.225
PRESERVATION OF AFFORDABLE

02:40:35.292 --> 02:40:37.828
HOUSING IMPLEMENTATION. ONE

02:40:37.894 --> 02:40:39.029
QUESTION THERE OF FOR CITIES

02:40:39.096 --> 02:40:40.731
THAT ARE DOING THIS WORK, AND

02:40:40.797 --> 02:40:42.532
YOU SAID THAT THERE COULD BE

02:40:42.599 --> 02:40:43.300
DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION. WHAT

02:40:43.367 --> 02:40:45.535
DEFINES THAT GOOD WORK. YEAH. SO

02:40:45.602 --> 02:40:47.604
TO PULL THIS OFF I WANT TO MAKE

02:40:47.671 --> 02:40:49.840
SURE I DON'T GET IT WRONG. SO

02:40:49.906 --> 02:40:51.341
ESSENTIALLY FOR CITIES THAT HAVE

02:40:51.408 --> 02:40:52.676
DONE A TRANSIT ORIENTED

02:40:52.743 --> 02:40:54.144
DEVELOPMENT UPZONING. AND SO

02:40:54.211 --> 02:40:57.347
THEY HAVE DENSITY AROUND IT,

02:40:57.414 --> 02:41:03.520
THEY WILL. IN FRONT OF ME IF

02:41:03.587 --> 02:41:05.989
THEY ACHIEVE A CERTAIN BASICALLY

02:41:06.056 --> 02:41:07.758
A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF WHAT SB

02:41:07.824 --> 02:41:09.026
79 WOULD REQUIRE, THEY DON'T

02:41:09.092 --> 02:41:10.961
HAVE TO GET ALL THE WAY THERE A

02:41:11.028 --> 02:41:13.597
CERTAIN PERCENTAGE, THEN THEY

02:41:13.663 --> 02:41:15.532
WILL BE BASICALLY EXEMPT UNTIL

02:41:15.599 --> 02:41:18.602
THE NEXT RINA CYCLE. AND SO AND

02:41:18.668 --> 02:41:20.003
THEN THEY'LL HAVE TO DO THEIR

02:41:20.070 --> 02:41:21.204
HOUSING ELEMENT ALL OVER AGAIN.

02:41:21.271 --> 02:41:22.305
AND THEN THESE WILL BE

02:41:22.372 --> 02:41:24.007
BACKGROUND RULES THAT THEY CAN

02:41:24.074 --> 02:41:25.876
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHEN THEY'RE

02:41:25.942 --> 02:41:26.877
FORMULATING THEIR HOUSING

02:41:26.943 --> 02:41:28.345
ELEMENT. BUT WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT

02:41:28.412 --> 02:41:29.913
SAYING YOU HAVE TO HAVE A TOD.

02:41:29.980 --> 02:41:31.882
THAT'S EVERY BIT AS AT THE LEVEL

02:41:31.948 --> 02:41:35.852
OF 79, AS LONG AS IT GETS A GOOD

02:41:35.919 --> 02:41:37.954
WAY PORTION OF THE WAY THERE.

02:41:38.021 --> 02:41:39.856
OKAY, GREAT. WELL, I'VE ASKED A

02:41:39.923 --> 02:41:41.892
LOT OF QUESTIONS AND SORT OF, I

02:41:41.958 --> 02:41:42.826
THINK HOPEFULLY SET A STAGE FOR

02:41:42.893 --> 02:41:44.528
MORE COMMITTEE CONVERSATION AS

02:41:44.594 --> 02:41:46.296
WELL HERE TOO. SO I APPRECIATE

02:41:46.363 --> 02:41:46.930
THE PROGRESS THAT YOU'RE MAKING

02:41:46.997 --> 02:41:48.965
ON THIS. I KNOW THAT THERE IS

02:41:49.032 --> 02:41:50.600
MORE WORK TO BE DONE ON THIS AS

02:41:50.667 --> 02:41:52.903
WELL TOO, AND I'M HAPPY TO MAKE

02:41:52.969 --> 02:41:54.538
A MOTION AND SUPPORT THE BILL

02:41:54.604 --> 02:41:55.338
HERE TODAY. THANK YOU.

02:41:55.405 --> 02:41:55.972
ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S WARD ASSEMBLY

02:41:56.039 --> 02:41:57.441
MEMBER WILSON. THANK YOU TO THE

02:41:57.507 --> 02:41:58.742
AUTHOR. YOU KNOW, I APPRECIATE

02:41:58.809 --> 02:42:00.177
THE WORK YOU'VE DONE SO FAR, AND

02:42:00.243 --> 02:42:01.178
I ACTUALLY APPRECIATE THE

02:42:01.244 --> 02:42:02.546
THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS FROM MY

02:42:02.612 --> 02:42:03.680
COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO AND

02:42:03.747 --> 02:42:04.681
ALIGN MYSELF WITH QUITE A BIT OF

02:42:04.748 --> 02:42:07.050
THEM, INCLUDING AROUND THE

02:42:07.117 --> 02:42:08.685
PRESERVATION OF OUR HISTORICAL

02:42:08.752 --> 02:42:10.787
DISTRICTS AND HISTORY. I ALWAYS

02:42:10.854 --> 02:42:12.222
SAY, ESPECIALLY IN HOUSING

02:42:12.289 --> 02:42:13.657
COMMITTEE, OUR CITIES AND OUR

02:42:13.723 --> 02:42:15.158
COUNTIES ARE NOT MUSEUMS, BUT

02:42:15.225 --> 02:42:16.960
THERE ARE PORTIONS OF OUR CITIES

02:42:17.027 --> 02:42:19.029
AND COUNTIES THAT ARE ACTUALLY

02:42:19.096 --> 02:42:21.998
MUSEUMS AND SHOULD BE PRESERVED.

02:42:22.065 --> 02:42:23.300
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF

02:42:23.366 --> 02:42:24.868
CONVERSATIONS, AND SO I WON'T

02:42:24.935 --> 02:42:26.536
BELABOR THE POINT HERE AND

02:42:26.603 --> 02:42:27.704
RECOGNIZE WE, YOU KNOW, IT'S A

02:42:27.771 --> 02:42:30.273
LONG DAY. AND JUST NOTE THE

02:42:30.340 --> 02:42:33.176
FOLLOW UP CONCERNS I HAD AROUND

02:42:33.243 --> 02:42:35.745
WHAT HAPPENS WHERE A COMMUNITY

02:42:35.812 --> 02:42:37.347
HAS DONE THE WORK THAT WHEN

02:42:37.414 --> 02:42:39.950
UNDER THE ORIGINAL ELEMENT, THE

02:42:40.016 --> 02:42:42.252
ORIGINAL RULES, THAT THEY WENT

02:42:42.319 --> 02:42:44.287
ABOVE AND BEYOND, WHAT WERE THE

02:42:44.354 --> 02:42:45.956
RULES THERE AT THIS TIME? AND

02:42:46.022 --> 02:42:46.990
NOW IN THE PROCESS OF

02:42:47.057 --> 02:42:49.359
IMPLEMENTING AND NOW WE'RE

02:42:49.426 --> 02:42:50.527
CREATING A NEW RULE AND A NEW

02:42:50.594 --> 02:42:51.828
HURDLE. AND SO MAKING SURE WE'RE

02:42:51.895 --> 02:42:53.663
BEING MINDFUL OF THAT WORK AND

02:42:53.730 --> 02:42:55.565
THE CHARACTER THAT, THAT, THAT

02:42:55.632 --> 02:42:56.766
THOSE CITIES HAVE HAD TO BUILD.

02:42:56.833 --> 02:42:58.802
I HAVE FOUR OR HAVE THREE

02:42:58.869 --> 02:43:00.570
EXISTING IN MY DISTRICT OF THESE

02:43:00.637 --> 02:43:02.539
TYPES OF THAT WOULD BE IMPACTED

02:43:02.606 --> 02:43:03.907
BY 79. I HAVE ONE ON THE WAY

02:43:03.974 --> 02:43:06.543
BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE A TRAIN

02:43:06.610 --> 02:43:08.512
STOP COMING. AND SO I'M REALLY

02:43:08.578 --> 02:43:09.946
MINDFUL OF WHAT THE IMPACT THAT

02:43:10.013 --> 02:43:11.515
WOULD BE ON THAT CITY. AND ALSO

02:43:11.581 --> 02:43:13.049
RECOGNIZING I'M I'M MORE IN AN

02:43:13.116 --> 02:43:14.384
AREA WHERE THEY FALL UNDER THE

02:43:14.451 --> 02:43:18.121
TIER TWO AND THAT WHAT HOW ARE

02:43:18.188 --> 02:43:21.091
WE THE LANGUAGE AROUND? AND I

02:43:21.158 --> 02:43:22.759
JUST GOT THIS FROM ONE OF MY

02:43:22.826 --> 02:43:23.927
CITIES AROUND FEASIBILITY OF

02:43:23.994 --> 02:43:26.496
WHEN A PROJECT OF A CERTAIN SIZE

02:43:26.563 --> 02:43:27.130
FEASIBILITY. SOMETIMES WHEN YOU

02:43:27.197 --> 02:43:30.133
GET INTO THESE HIGH DENSE TYPES

02:43:30.200 --> 02:43:32.035
OF CONSTRUCTION OR DEVELOPMENT,

02:43:32.102 --> 02:43:33.870
YOU THEN HAVE TO USE STEEL

02:43:33.937 --> 02:43:35.805
BECAUSE IT'S SO TALL, PER THE

02:43:35.872 --> 02:43:37.140
REQUIREMENTS OF HOW MANY UNITS

02:43:37.207 --> 02:43:40.243
PER ACRE AND THEN HEIGHT. BUT IF

02:43:40.310 --> 02:43:41.711
YOU'RE HAVING THAT LEVEL OF COST

02:43:41.778 --> 02:43:43.013
OF CONSTRUCTION, YOU HAVE TO

02:43:43.079 --> 02:43:45.448
HAVE THAT LEVEL OF MARKET IN

02:43:45.515 --> 02:43:48.785
TERMS OF RENT, RIGHT, TO BE ABLE

02:43:48.852 --> 02:43:49.953
TO SUBSTANTIATE THAT COST. AND

02:43:50.020 --> 02:43:51.821
THEN WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU CAN'T

02:43:51.888 --> 02:43:53.423
GET THERE? AND AS A REMINDER

02:43:53.490 --> 02:43:54.024
THERE IMMEDIATELY, IF THEY'RE

02:43:54.090 --> 02:43:56.459
NOT ZONING TO THAT, THEY ARE OUT

02:43:56.526 --> 02:43:57.894
OF COMPLIANCE. AND SO IT'S NOT

02:43:57.961 --> 02:43:59.896
LIKE THE CITY IS BUILDING IT.

02:43:59.963 --> 02:44:01.031
THIS IS A DEVELOPER. BUT IF

02:44:01.097 --> 02:44:02.699
THEIR ZONING TO WHERE YOU CAN'T

02:44:02.766 --> 02:44:04.434
GET A PROJECT, THEN YOU HAVE THE

02:44:04.501 --> 02:44:05.035
COUNTER THING WHERE YOU HAVE

02:44:05.101 --> 02:44:07.270
NOTHING BEING DONE ON A SITE AND

02:44:07.337 --> 02:44:08.905
YOU WANT DEVELOPMENT. SO I

02:44:08.972 --> 02:44:11.474
DEFINITELY WANT THAT TAKEN INTO

02:44:11.541 --> 02:44:12.442
CONSIDERATION. BUT I DO KNOW

02:44:12.509 --> 02:44:14.678
THAT I TRUST YOU AS AN AUTHOR

02:44:14.744 --> 02:44:16.746
WHO HAVE TAKEN THE OPPORTUNITY.

02:44:16.813 --> 02:44:18.615
YOU BRING EVERYONE TO THE TABLE,

02:44:18.682 --> 02:44:20.050
YOU FIGURE OUT THE PATHWAY

02:44:20.116 --> 02:44:21.885
FORWARD. I NOTED THAT ON THE

02:44:21.952 --> 02:44:24.020
COMMENTS EARLIER, AND SO I TRUST

02:44:24.087 --> 02:44:25.755
THAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO THAT

02:44:25.822 --> 02:44:28.358
AND TAKE ALL OF THESE THINGS

02:44:28.425 --> 02:44:30.093
INTO CONSIDERATION AND

02:44:30.160 --> 02:44:33.763
RECOGNIZING THAT CITIES AND, AND

02:44:33.830 --> 02:44:35.498
COUNTIES, JURISDICTIONS, YOU

02:44:35.565 --> 02:44:37.667
KNOW, THIS IS THEIR WHEELHOUSE,

02:44:37.734 --> 02:44:39.936
BEING ABLE TO APPROVE THESE

02:44:40.003 --> 02:44:41.104
TYPES OF PROJECTS AND DETERMINE

02:44:41.171 --> 02:44:42.772
WHAT IS THE BEST FIT AS IT

02:44:42.839 --> 02:44:44.708
RELATES TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE

02:44:44.774 --> 02:44:45.909
THAT THEY HAVE AND THE WATER

02:44:45.976 --> 02:44:48.111
NEEDS THEY HAVE. BUT I ALSO WILL

02:44:48.178 --> 02:44:49.279
SAY TO OUR TO OUR CITIES AND

02:44:49.346 --> 02:44:50.814
COUNTIES IS WHEN IT COMES TO

02:44:50.880 --> 02:44:52.649
STOPS LIKE THESE, WE ADVOCATE

02:44:52.716 --> 02:44:54.384
FOR THEM. I REMEMBER BEING A

02:44:54.451 --> 02:44:55.952
PART OF A TEAM THAT ADVOCATED,

02:44:56.019 --> 02:44:57.721
YOU KNOW, WE WANT THE STOP.

02:44:57.787 --> 02:44:59.322
WE'RE ASKING FOR THE STOP. AND

02:44:59.389 --> 02:45:01.157
SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO ADVOCATE

02:45:01.224 --> 02:45:03.560
FOR THESE TYPES OF STOPS, THEN

02:45:03.627 --> 02:45:04.628
YOU'RE THEN YOU'RE THEN THERE'S

02:45:04.694 --> 02:45:06.630
SOME RULES TO ABIDE BY WHEN

02:45:06.696 --> 02:45:08.798
THOSE TYPE OF STOPS WILL COME

02:45:08.865 --> 02:45:10.533
AND THAT YOU'LL BUILD IN A WAY

02:45:10.600 --> 02:45:11.735
THAT MAXIMIZES AND LEVERAGES

02:45:11.801 --> 02:45:12.902
THOSE STOPS. BECAUSE THESE STOPS

02:45:12.969 --> 02:45:14.871
ARE ALWAYS UNLESS YOU'RE BRIGHT

02:45:14.938 --> 02:45:17.707
LINE, THESE STOPS COME WITH

02:45:17.774 --> 02:45:19.809
PUBLIC DOLLARS. AND SO BECAUSE

02:45:19.876 --> 02:45:21.144
THEY COME WITH PUBLIC DOLLARS,

02:45:21.211 --> 02:45:24.114
THEY ARE THEY THEY REQUIRE A

02:45:24.180 --> 02:45:25.649
LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND

02:45:25.715 --> 02:45:27.150
TRUST THAT WILL BE USING THAT

02:45:27.217 --> 02:45:28.084
SITE APPROPRIATELY. AND WITH

02:45:28.151 --> 02:45:29.753
THAT, I'LL MAKE THE SECOND. AND

02:45:29.819 --> 02:45:32.122
I THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:45:32.188 --> 02:45:33.123
WILSON. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:45:33.189 --> 02:45:34.658
STEPHANIE. THANK YOU. CHAIR. I

02:45:34.724 --> 02:45:35.859
ALSO HAVE TO MAKE IT BRIEF

02:45:35.925 --> 02:45:38.595
BECAUSE I HAVE TO GET TO ANOTHER

02:45:38.662 --> 02:45:39.729
COMMITTEE. BUT I WANT TO THANK

02:45:39.796 --> 02:45:41.298
SENATOR WIENER FOR YOUR FOCUS ON

02:45:41.364 --> 02:45:42.932
HOUSING AND OUR RESPONSIBILITY

02:45:42.999 --> 02:45:44.000
TO BUILD MORE HOUSING. I SHARE

02:45:44.067 --> 02:45:45.735
THAT GOAL AND TO BUILD IT, OF

02:45:45.802 --> 02:45:47.504
COURSE, IN THE RIGHT PLACES.

02:45:47.570 --> 02:45:48.905
TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT IS

02:45:48.972 --> 02:45:50.073
ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS

02:45:50.140 --> 02:45:51.841
WE CAN ADDRESS OUR HOUSING

02:45:51.908 --> 02:45:54.010
SHORTAGE, WHILE ALSO REDUCING

02:45:54.077 --> 02:45:55.078
CONGESTION AND CLIMATE

02:45:55.145 --> 02:45:56.279
EMISSIONS, WHICH IS VERY

02:45:56.346 --> 02:45:57.681
IMPORTANT TO MY DAUGHTER AND THE

02:45:57.747 --> 02:46:00.817
NEXT GENERATION. OF COURSE, SB

02:46:00.884 --> 02:46:02.585
79 MOVES US IN THAT DIRECTION BY

02:46:02.652 --> 02:46:03.887
MAKING IT EASIER TO BUILD HOMES

02:46:03.953 --> 02:46:05.622
NEAR HIGH QUALITY TRANSIT. AND I

02:46:05.689 --> 02:46:07.657
WANT TO RECOGNIZE TWO BEING FROM

02:46:07.724 --> 02:46:09.159
LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT I

02:46:09.225 --> 02:46:10.193
APPRECIATE THAT THIS BILL

02:46:10.260 --> 02:46:12.028
INCLUDES KEY AFFORDABILITY

02:46:12.095 --> 02:46:13.396
PROVISIONS AND FLEXIBILITY FOR

02:46:13.463 --> 02:46:15.198
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, ESPECIALLY

02:46:15.265 --> 02:46:16.733
FOR THOSE THAT HAVE ALREADY

02:46:16.800 --> 02:46:18.234
TAKEN MEANINGFUL STEPS TO

02:46:18.301 --> 02:46:19.969
INCREASE DENSITY NEAR TRANSIT.

02:46:20.036 --> 02:46:22.472
THE INCLUSION OF A LOCAL

02:46:22.539 --> 02:46:24.174
ALTERNATIVE PATHWAY, I THINK,

02:46:24.240 --> 02:46:26.042
SHOWS RESPONSIVENESS TO

02:46:26.109 --> 02:46:27.811
STAKEHOLDER CONCERNS AND HELPS

02:46:27.877 --> 02:46:30.146
ENSURE THAT THIS POLICY CAN WORK

02:46:30.213 --> 02:46:31.915
IN A VARIETY OF CONTEXTS AND

02:46:31.981 --> 02:46:33.550
REALLY GIVE CITIES THAT

02:46:33.616 --> 02:46:34.784
FLEXIBILITY IF THEY'VE ALREADY

02:46:34.851 --> 02:46:36.686
DONE THE WORK. AND THE WORK THAT

02:46:36.753 --> 02:46:38.421
WE ACKNOWLEDGE IS SO IMPORTANT

02:46:38.488 --> 02:46:40.123
TO DO. I ALSO WANT TO RAISE AND

02:46:40.190 --> 02:46:42.225
WE I TALKED TO YOU ABOUT THIS,

02:46:42.292 --> 02:46:44.127
THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE

02:46:44.194 --> 02:46:45.462
BUILDING TRADES, SOMETHING THAT

02:46:45.528 --> 02:46:47.897
I DO CARE ABOUT. WE NEED TO BE

02:46:47.964 --> 02:46:49.232
BUILDING MORE HOUSING, BUT IT

02:46:49.299 --> 02:46:52.001
HAS TO BE PAID WITH FAIR WAGES.

02:46:52.068 --> 02:46:54.070
AND IT HAS. WE HAVE TO HAVE

02:46:54.137 --> 02:46:56.639
STRONG WORKFORCE PROTECTIONS. I

02:46:56.706 --> 02:46:58.475
TRULY BELIEVE LABOR STANDARDS

02:46:58.541 --> 02:47:00.276
MATTER. AND I ENCOURAGE YOU,

02:47:00.343 --> 02:47:01.644
SENATOR WIENER, AS WE'VE

02:47:01.711 --> 02:47:03.847
DISCUSSED, AND I KNOW THAT YOU

02:47:03.913 --> 02:47:05.749
WILL CONTINUE TO WORK IN GOOD

02:47:05.815 --> 02:47:06.883
FAITH WITH THE TRADES TO ADDRESS

02:47:06.950 --> 02:47:08.251
THEIR CONCERNS AS THIS BILL

02:47:08.318 --> 02:47:09.419
MOVES FORWARD. AGAIN, I SUPPORT

02:47:09.486 --> 02:47:11.788
THE INTENT OF SB 79 AND THINK,

02:47:11.855 --> 02:47:13.890
THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON

02:47:13.957 --> 02:47:15.792
HOUSING, AND I DO LOOK FORWARD

02:47:15.859 --> 02:47:16.793
TO SEEING THIS CONVERSATION

02:47:16.860 --> 02:47:18.228
CONTINUE AND HOPE THAT WE LAND

02:47:18.294 --> 02:47:20.163
ON A FINAL VERSION OF THE BILL

02:47:20.230 --> 02:47:21.197
THAT ADVANCES BOTH HOUSING AND

02:47:21.264 --> 02:47:23.299
WORKFORCE PROTECTIONS. AND SO

02:47:23.366 --> 02:47:25.702
WITH THAT, I HAVE TO LEAVE TO MY

02:47:25.769 --> 02:47:26.870
NEXT COMMITTEE. THANK YOU,

02:47:26.936 --> 02:47:27.504
ASSEMBLYMEMBER STEPHANIE, WE'RE

02:47:27.570 --> 02:47:28.905
GONNA GO TO ASSEMBLYMAN BRONSON

02:47:28.972 --> 02:47:31.508
BECAUSE HE HAS TO LEAVE, TOO. I

02:47:31.574 --> 02:47:32.675
DO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. CHAIR,

02:47:32.742 --> 02:47:34.010
I WANT TO THANK SENATOR WIENER

02:47:34.077 --> 02:47:35.912
FOR THIS BILL AND FOR BEING VERY

02:47:35.979 --> 02:47:37.614
THOUGHTFUL IN THIS BILL. I MEAN,

02:47:37.680 --> 02:47:39.749
26 AMENDMENTS IS MORE THAN MANY

02:47:39.816 --> 02:47:41.251
POINTS THAT WE HAVE IN MOST

02:47:41.317 --> 02:47:43.420
BILLS. SO THAT DEMONSTRATES THAT

02:47:43.486 --> 02:47:46.589
YOU ARE WILLING TO WORK WITH THE

02:47:46.656 --> 02:47:48.224
COMMUNITY. I THINK TRANSIT

02:47:48.291 --> 02:47:49.659
ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT IS VERY

02:47:49.726 --> 02:47:51.060
IMPORTANT. AND I, I DON'T THINK

02:47:51.127 --> 02:47:53.596
THIS IS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL

02:47:53.663 --> 02:47:54.164
BILL. I THINK IT WAS VERY

02:47:54.230 --> 02:47:55.532
THOUGHTFUL, BILL, WHERE YOU'VE

02:47:55.598 --> 02:47:57.133
TAKEN, YOU KNOW, MEASURE TO LOOK

02:47:57.200 --> 02:47:59.102
AT INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITIES, SIZES

02:47:59.169 --> 02:48:01.571
OF THE RAIL AND THE TRAVEL. AND

02:48:01.638 --> 02:48:03.039
I THINK THOSE THINGS ARE VERY

02:48:03.106 --> 02:48:04.908
IMPORTANT. AND I ALSO APPRECIATE

02:48:04.974 --> 02:48:06.543
THE CONVERSATION THAT WE HAD

02:48:06.609 --> 02:48:08.111
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THERE NOT BEING

02:48:08.178 --> 02:48:09.779
ENOUGH FOCUS ON HOUSING

02:48:09.846 --> 02:48:11.247
AFFORDABILITY. AND THEN YOU CAME

02:48:11.314 --> 02:48:12.382
BACK WITH MORE HOUSING

02:48:12.449 --> 02:48:13.616
AFFORDABILITY. SO WITH THAT

02:48:13.683 --> 02:48:15.051
SAID, I DO KNOW THAT YOU ARE

02:48:15.118 --> 02:48:17.153
VERY WORKABLE, AND I THINK THAT

02:48:17.220 --> 02:48:19.222
THAT IS WHAT WE NEED, YOU KNOW,

02:48:19.289 --> 02:48:20.990
AS WE ARE TRYING TO SOLVE FOR

02:48:21.057 --> 02:48:24.194
THIS ISSUE AS LEADERS, WE ALSO

02:48:24.260 --> 02:48:25.361
HAVE TO RECONCILE THE NEEDS AND

02:48:25.428 --> 02:48:26.596
CONCERNS OF OUR CONSTITUENTS AND

02:48:26.663 --> 02:48:27.564
OUR STAKEHOLDERS. AND THAT'S

02:48:27.630 --> 02:48:29.933
WHAT I'M WORKING TO DO. BUILDING

02:48:29.999 --> 02:48:31.968
TRADES AS AS MEMBER STEPHANIE

02:48:32.035 --> 02:48:33.603
MENTIONED, DID SHARE SOME

02:48:33.670 --> 02:48:34.938
CONCERNS. AND THERE ARE ALSO

02:48:35.004 --> 02:48:36.806
SOME OTHER CENTRAL VALLEY

02:48:36.873 --> 02:48:38.541
CONCERNS. IN FACT, I THINK WE

02:48:38.608 --> 02:48:40.009
SAW SOME TESTIMONY. BUT I DO

02:48:40.076 --> 02:48:41.411
KNOW AND TRUST THAT YOU'RE GOING

02:48:41.478 --> 02:48:42.645
TO CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARDS

02:48:42.712 --> 02:48:45.415
THOSE ISSUES. I THINK THAT THIS

02:48:45.482 --> 02:48:46.382
IS A STRONG BILL, DEFINITELY A

02:48:46.449 --> 02:48:47.917
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND

02:48:47.984 --> 02:48:49.719
AS SOMEONE WHO COMES FROM LOCAL

02:48:49.786 --> 02:48:51.421
GOVERNMENT, HAD AN OPPORTUNITY

02:48:51.488 --> 02:48:52.889
TO SERVE WITH FORMER MAYOR TUBBS

02:48:52.956 --> 02:48:54.157
THAT YOU BROUGHT HERE, PROBABLY

02:48:54.224 --> 02:48:56.292
TRYING TO CONVINCE ME. BUT, YOU

02:48:56.359 --> 02:48:57.894
KNOW, HAVING HAVING WORKED WITH

02:48:57.961 --> 02:49:00.396
HIM, WE KNOW THAT IT'S VERY

02:49:00.463 --> 02:49:01.364
IMPORTANT, AND WE HAVE TO MAKE

02:49:01.431 --> 02:49:02.932
SURE THAT WE'RE RECOGNIZING THE

02:49:02.999 --> 02:49:04.567
VOICE OF LOCAL LEADERS AND

02:49:04.634 --> 02:49:05.902
MAKING THEM FEEL LIKE THEY ARE

02:49:05.969 --> 02:49:08.338
PART OF THE DECISIONS. AND I

02:49:08.404 --> 02:49:10.139
THINK THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GETTING

02:49:10.206 --> 02:49:11.608
CLOSE. AND I KNOW YOU'RE

02:49:11.674 --> 02:49:12.375
CONTINUING TO HAVE THOSE

02:49:12.442 --> 02:49:13.877
CONVERSATIONS, AND I JUST WANT

02:49:13.943 --> 02:49:15.144
TO THANK YOU FOR BEING WORKABLE

02:49:15.211 --> 02:49:17.113
AND FOR DOING THAT. AND I I'M

02:49:17.180 --> 02:49:18.281
PRETTY SURE THAT WE'LL GET AN

02:49:18.348 --> 02:49:19.782
OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT THIS. SO

02:49:19.849 --> 02:49:21.784
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WE'RE

02:49:21.851 --> 02:49:23.987
GOING TO GO BACK TO THIS SIDE.

02:49:24.053 --> 02:49:26.422
ASSEMBLYMEMBER RUBIO, THANK YOU,

02:49:26.489 --> 02:49:29.225
SENATOR. IT'S I REALLY

02:49:29.292 --> 02:49:30.627
APPRECIATE WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER

02:49:30.693 --> 02:49:33.229
NOW FOR EIGHT YEARS. AND EVERY

02:49:33.296 --> 02:49:36.032
SINGLE TIME I KNOW I LOVE YOU.

02:49:36.099 --> 02:49:39.302
BUT AS YOU KNOW WE ARE REALLY

02:49:39.369 --> 02:49:41.070
LIKE ON OPPOSITE SIDES MOST OF

02:49:41.137 --> 02:49:43.006
THE TIME. BUT THE WAY THAT WE

02:49:43.072 --> 02:49:44.841
WORK TOGETHER HAS BEEN AMAZING

02:49:44.908 --> 02:49:46.676
THROUGH THE YEARS. AND I REALLY

02:49:46.743 --> 02:49:48.711
APPRECIATE ALL OF THE WORK THAT

02:49:48.778 --> 02:49:50.613
YOU PUT INTO THIS. AND WE'VE HAD

02:49:50.680 --> 02:49:52.348
LITERALLY HOURS OF CONVERSATIONS

02:49:52.415 --> 02:49:53.950
AND YOU'VE YOU'VE ADDRESSED A

02:49:54.017 --> 02:49:56.352
LOT OF THE CONCERNS. THE

02:49:56.419 --> 02:49:58.521
STRATEGY FROM OUR FOLKS HERE IS

02:49:58.588 --> 02:50:00.023
TO BRING MY CITIES HERE. MY

02:50:00.089 --> 02:50:01.791
MAYOR IS HERE FROM THE CITY OF

02:50:01.858 --> 02:50:02.425
AZUSA, WHICH ALSO REMINDED ME

02:50:02.492 --> 02:50:04.527
THAT THE CITY OF AZUSA HAS DONE

02:50:04.594 --> 02:50:06.396
A LOT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S

02:50:06.462 --> 02:50:08.298
HOUSING. WE ALSO ARE PROBABLY

02:50:08.364 --> 02:50:10.433
THE FIRST IN THE STATE TO HAVE A

02:50:10.500 --> 02:50:12.802
HOUSING TRUST IN THROUGH OUR

02:50:12.869 --> 02:50:15.271
COG. MR. LENO IS HERE AS WELL,

02:50:15.338 --> 02:50:17.140
AND THEY'VE DONE A LOT TO MAKE

02:50:17.206 --> 02:50:19.008
SURE THAT WE ARE BUILDING HOMES.

02:50:19.075 --> 02:50:21.544
AND SO I KNOW THAT THAT YOU'RE

02:50:21.611 --> 02:50:23.413
NOT TRYING TO DO A ONE SIZE FITS

02:50:23.479 --> 02:50:25.848
ALL. BUT FOR MY COMMUNITY, SEVEN

02:50:25.915 --> 02:50:28.718
OF MY EIGHT CITIES ARE ARE

02:50:28.785 --> 02:50:31.554
SUBJECT TO, TO THIS WHICH AND I

02:50:31.621 --> 02:50:34.190
CAN TELL YOU THAT MOST OF THEM

02:50:34.257 --> 02:50:34.791
ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING TO

02:50:34.857 --> 02:50:36.159
MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE HOUSING.

02:50:36.225 --> 02:50:38.528
THERE'S ONE, THAT 1 OR 2 THAT

02:50:38.595 --> 02:50:40.463
MAY NOT. BUT FOR THE MOST PART,

02:50:40.530 --> 02:50:41.631
I KNOW THAT THE, THE, THE

02:50:41.698 --> 02:50:42.832
CITIES, INCLUDING THE CITY OF

02:50:42.899 --> 02:50:44.200
AZUSA, IS DOING EVERYTHING

02:50:44.267 --> 02:50:46.736
POSSIBLE. I DO APPRECIATE ALL

02:50:46.803 --> 02:50:48.071
THE WHOLE ENTIRE, YOU KNOW,

02:50:48.137 --> 02:50:49.138
CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD, ALL OF

02:50:49.205 --> 02:50:51.040
THE WORK THAT YOU'VE PUT IN. I

02:50:51.107 --> 02:50:52.809
WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT

02:50:52.875 --> 02:50:54.744
TODAY, BUT IF IT GETS OUT, I

02:50:54.811 --> 02:50:56.913
WANT TO WORK WITH YOU AND WORK

02:50:56.980 --> 02:50:58.114
WITH MY CITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:50:58.181 --> 02:50:59.983
THEY THAT THEY GET TO THE POINT

02:51:00.049 --> 02:51:02.986
WHERE I CAN SUPPORT. I HAVE TO

02:51:03.052 --> 02:51:05.188
TAKE THE, THE, YOU KNOW, MY

02:51:05.254 --> 02:51:08.024
CONSTITUENTS FIRST ON THIS. AND

02:51:08.091 --> 02:51:09.993
I KNOW THERE WAS OTHER ISSUES WE

02:51:10.059 --> 02:51:10.860
WERE DISCUSSING. THEY'RE NO

02:51:10.927 --> 02:51:11.995
LONGER ON THE TABLE FOR ME. I

02:51:12.061 --> 02:51:13.696
KNOW YOU'VE ADDRESSED THOSE, BUT

02:51:13.763 --> 02:51:14.998
MY CITIES ARE REALLY IMPORTANT

02:51:15.064 --> 02:51:17.066
TO ME. AND, YOU KNOW, I HOPE

02:51:17.133 --> 02:51:18.368
THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK

02:51:18.434 --> 02:51:20.303
TOGETHER. AND I WILL MAKE SURE

02:51:20.370 --> 02:51:22.038
THAT THE CITY OF AZUSA AND MY

02:51:22.105 --> 02:51:24.007
OTHER CITIES ARE AT THE TABLE

02:51:24.073 --> 02:51:25.208
AND COMMUNICATE WITH YOU. WHAT

02:51:25.274 --> 02:51:27.276
CAN GET THEM TO THAT? THAT YES,

02:51:27.343 --> 02:51:30.613
I DON'T I'M NOT OF ONE THAT JUST

02:51:30.680 --> 02:51:32.949
TO GET RID OF THE BILL, TO GET

02:51:33.016 --> 02:51:34.984
RID OF IT. I KNOW THAT THERE'S A

02:51:35.051 --> 02:51:36.019
SOLUTION BECAUSE OF YOUR WORK,

02:51:36.085 --> 02:51:38.254
AND I KNOW THAT MY CITIES WILL

02:51:38.321 --> 02:51:40.757
GO TO, TO, YOU KNOW, COME TO THE

02:51:40.823 --> 02:51:41.357
TABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

02:51:41.424 --> 02:51:42.959
ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED. I'M NOT

02:51:43.026 --> 02:51:44.594
TAKING A NØ JUST BECAUSE A NO AS

02:51:44.661 --> 02:51:46.529
AN ANSWER. AND, YOU KNOW, I

02:51:46.596 --> 02:51:47.930
WOULD LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:51:47.997 --> 02:51:49.399
CONTINUE TO WORK AND FOR THE

02:51:49.465 --> 02:51:50.600
CITIES TO CONTINUE TO WORK AND

02:51:50.667 --> 02:51:51.934
FOR YOU TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON

02:51:52.001 --> 02:51:54.237
THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

02:51:54.303 --> 02:51:56.606
MEMBER RAMOS. THANK YOU, MR.

02:51:56.673 --> 02:51:58.307
CHAIR. AND TO THE AUTHOR, THANK

02:51:58.374 --> 02:52:00.977
YOU FOR ENGAGING WITH THE CITY

02:52:01.044 --> 02:52:02.712
OF SAN BERNARDINO. BUT I WANTED

02:52:02.779 --> 02:52:05.081
TO SEE IF YOU COULD ELABORATE ON

02:52:05.148 --> 02:52:06.182
THE DISCUSSIONS AND WHAT THE

02:52:06.249 --> 02:52:09.218
AGREEMENT CAME TO BE, SO THAT WE

02:52:09.285 --> 02:52:10.319
KNOW THAT THAT'S COMING UP DOWN

02:52:10.386 --> 02:52:12.455
THE ROAD, BECAUSE I DON'T THINK

02:52:12.522 --> 02:52:13.523
THERE WAS ENOUGH TIME. NOW

02:52:13.589 --> 02:52:15.558
WITHIN THE COMMITTEE, THE

02:52:15.625 --> 02:52:18.428
AMENDMENTS AND THE ANALYSIS

02:52:18.494 --> 02:52:20.396
ENCOMPASS EVERYTHING.

02:52:20.463 --> 02:52:21.330
EVERYTHING'S IN THE ANALYSIS. SO

02:52:21.397 --> 02:52:23.533
WHAT WE'VE WHAT WE'VE WORKED TO

02:52:23.599 --> 02:52:27.503
DO CONTINUALLY IN THIS BILL IS

02:52:27.570 --> 02:52:29.405
BECAUSE IT'S NOT A ONE SIZE FITS

02:52:29.472 --> 02:52:31.207
ALL. THERE'S FIRST OF ALL, IT

02:52:31.274 --> 02:52:32.141
ONLY APPLIES FOR CITIES THAT

02:52:32.208 --> 02:52:33.743
HAVE THE HIGHEST QUALITY

02:52:33.810 --> 02:52:36.079
TRANSIT. IT SEPARATED INTO TIER

02:52:36.145 --> 02:52:39.515
ONE, TIER TWO AND TIER THREE

02:52:39.582 --> 02:52:40.783
DEPENDING. CITIES HAVE THE

02:52:40.850 --> 02:52:42.518
ABILITY TO DO A LOCAL

02:52:42.585 --> 02:52:43.986
FLEXIBILITY STANDARD. WE MADE AN

02:52:44.053 --> 02:52:46.456
AMENDMENT IN THE SENATE

02:52:46.522 --> 02:52:48.124
DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN SORT OF

02:52:48.191 --> 02:52:50.126
MORE TRANSIT RICH, LARGER

02:52:50.193 --> 02:52:52.261
COUNTIES VERSUS COUNTIES THAT

02:52:52.328 --> 02:52:54.497
ARE SMALLER AND LESS TRANSIT

02:52:54.564 --> 02:52:55.865
RICH, AND WE HAVE DIFFERENT

02:52:55.932 --> 02:52:57.700
APPROACHES IN THOSE TWO SETS OF

02:52:57.767 --> 02:53:01.704
COUNTIES. AND ONE OF THOSE, FOR

02:53:01.771 --> 02:53:03.840
EXAMPLE, BUS RAPID TRANSIT IS

02:53:03.906 --> 02:53:07.410
PART OF THE IS PART OF THE PART

02:53:07.477 --> 02:53:09.245
OF THE BILL. SO FOR EXAMPLE, IN

02:53:09.312 --> 02:53:11.481
THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO, WE

02:53:11.547 --> 02:53:13.583
WILL HAVE TWO BUS RAPID TRANSIT

02:53:13.649 --> 02:53:16.052
LINES THAT WILL BE COVERED BY SB

02:53:16.119 --> 02:53:18.588
79. BUT FOR THE CITIES THAT ARE

02:53:18.654 --> 02:53:20.356
LESS TRANSIT OR EXCUSE ME, THE

02:53:20.423 --> 02:53:21.891
COUNTIES THAT ARE LESS TRANSIT

02:53:21.958 --> 02:53:24.327
RICH, WHICH IS THE BULK OF THEM,

02:53:24.393 --> 02:53:27.964
WHICH WHICH INCLUDES SAN JOAQUIN

02:53:28.030 --> 02:53:30.500
COUNTY, WHICH INCLUDES SOLANO

02:53:30.566 --> 02:53:31.968
COUNTY AND SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY

02:53:32.034 --> 02:53:34.537
AS WELL. BUS RAPID TRANSIT IS

02:53:34.604 --> 02:53:38.474
NOT PART OF THE BILL. AND SO WE

02:53:38.541 --> 02:53:40.610
SO WE'VE WE HAVE REALLY TAKEN

02:53:40.676 --> 02:53:42.645
INTO ACCOUNT DIFFERENT KINDS OF

02:53:42.712 --> 02:53:45.148
COUNTIES AND ALSO DIFFERENT

02:53:45.214 --> 02:53:47.150
KINDS OF TRANSIT. SO THAT THAT'S

02:53:47.216 --> 02:53:48.117
BEEN SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN

02:53:48.184 --> 02:53:50.086
IMPORTANT TO ME FROM THE

02:53:50.153 --> 02:53:51.154
BEGINNING. AND THOSE ARE THE

02:53:51.220 --> 02:53:52.455
KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS WE'LL

02:53:52.522 --> 02:53:53.890
CONTINUE TO HAVE. AND ALL THE

02:53:53.956 --> 02:53:55.258
AMENDMENTS ARE IN THE ANALYSIS.

02:53:55.324 --> 02:53:57.126

TIME ADDRESSING THOSE ISSUES,

02:54:04.901 --> 02:54:06.235
AND THERE COULD BE MORE ISSUES

02:54:06.302 --> 02:54:07.937
DOWN THE ROAD THAT WE'RE LOOKING

02:54:08.004 --> 02:54:09.806
FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON.

CITIES WITHIN MY I THINK ALL OF

MY CITIES WITHIN MY ASSEMBLY

02:54:32.562 --> 02:54:34.163
DISTRICT. AND SO THIS IS A TOUGH

02:54:34.230 --> 02:54:37.166
BILL BILL FOR ME TO VOTE VOTE ON

02:54:37.233 --> 02:54:38.234
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE'RE BUILT

02:54:38.301 --> 02:54:40.670
OUT CITIES. DOWNEY CITY OF

02:54:40.736 --> 02:54:42.505
DOWNEY WAS ONCE THE 11TH LARGEST

02:54:42.572 --> 02:54:44.707
CITY IN L.A. COUNTY OF 88

02:54:44.774 --> 02:54:47.310
CITIES. AND NOW WE'RE THE 10TH

02:54:47.376 --> 02:54:49.312
LARGEST CITY WITHIN L.A. COUNTY

02:54:49.378 --> 02:54:51.781
OF 88 CITIES. SO I KNOW A LOT OF

02:54:51.848 --> 02:54:53.382
THE CITIES WITHIN MY ASSEMBLY

02:54:53.449 --> 02:54:54.717
DISTRICT ARE DOING EVERYTHING

02:54:54.784 --> 02:54:55.818
THAT THEY CAN, YOU KNOW, TO

02:54:55.885 --> 02:54:58.788
BUILD HOUSING, YOU KNOW, ALL

02:54:58.855 --> 02:55:00.423
TYPES OF HOUSING, FROM SINGLE

02:55:00.489 --> 02:55:04.927
FAMILY TO A LOT OF CONDOS,

02:55:04.994 --> 02:55:07.363
TOWNHOMES. PARAMOUNT'S DOING THE

02:55:07.430 --> 02:55:09.966
SAME. AND SO A LOT OF OUR CITIES

02:55:10.032 --> 02:55:10.533
WITHIN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,

02:55:10.600 --> 02:55:13.169
WITHIN L.A. COUNTY, WE'RE JUST

02:55:13.236 --> 02:55:14.537
TO CAPACITY. WE'RE BUILT OUT.

02:55:14.604 --> 02:55:17.440
AND I LIVE MYSELF. I LIVE NEAR

02:55:17.506 --> 02:55:20.009
THE LIGHT RAIL, WHICH USED TO BE

02:55:20.076 --> 02:55:21.377
CALLED THE GREEN LINE. NOW IT'S

02:55:21.444 --> 02:55:23.913
CALLED THE C LINE, AND I AM

02:55:23.980 --> 02:55:26.749
ABOUT LESS THAN HALF A MILE FROM

02:55:26.816 --> 02:55:28.985
THAT. SO I KNOW CITY OF DOWNEY

02:55:29.051 --> 02:55:30.753
WOULD BE IMPACTED. WE HAVE A NEW

02:55:30.820 --> 02:55:32.121
LIGHT RAIL THAT'S GOING TO BE

02:55:32.188 --> 02:55:34.290
COMING IN THAT WILL BE COMING

02:55:34.357 --> 02:55:35.858
FROM THROUGH PARAMOUNT, THE

02:55:35.925 --> 02:55:39.095
SOUTHEAST GATEWAY LINE. AND SO I

02:55:39.161 --> 02:55:40.396
DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS

02:55:40.463 --> 02:55:43.299
BILL. I, I WOULD LIKE THE CITIES

02:55:43.366 --> 02:55:45.868
TO BE AT THE TABLE. I KNOW,

02:55:45.935 --> 02:55:47.937
SENATOR, YOU'VE MADE A LOT OF

02:55:48.004 --> 02:55:50.273
AMENDMENTS AND THIS BILL IS A

02:55:50.339 --> 02:55:51.007
WORK IN PROGRESS. BUT I ALSO

02:55:51.073 --> 02:55:53.009
WANT TO HAVE MAKE SURE THAT, YOU

02:55:53.075 --> 02:55:54.110
KNOW, OUR CITIES ARE BEING

02:55:54.176 --> 02:55:55.778
HEARD, THAT THEIR CONCERNS ARE

02:55:55.845 --> 02:55:57.747
BEING ADDRESSED. AND SO I CAN'T

02:55:57.813 --> 02:55:59.181
VOTE FOR THE BILL AT THIS TIME,

02:55:59.248 --> 02:56:02.418
BUT I'M HOPING THAT, YOU KNOW,

02:56:02.485 --> 02:56:04.186
THAT, YOU KNOW, THEY THE

02:56:04.253 --> 02:56:05.621
CONTRACT CITIES, THE LEAGUE OF

02:56:05.688 --> 02:56:06.822
CALIFORNIA CITIES AND OUR MAYORS

02:56:06.889 --> 02:56:08.891
ARE BEING HEARD BECAUSE OUR

02:56:08.958 --> 02:56:10.660
CITIES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,

02:56:10.726 --> 02:56:12.862
LIKE L.A. COUNTY AND ORANGE

02:56:12.929 --> 02:56:14.697
COUNTY, ARE MORE FOCUSED ON L.A.

02:56:14.764 --> 02:56:16.832
COUNTY, BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE I

02:56:16.899 --> 02:56:17.466
THAT'S WHAT I REPRESENT. BUT I

02:56:17.533 --> 02:56:19.802
JUST WANT THEM TO BE HEARD. AND

02:56:19.869 --> 02:56:21.871
I'VE ALWAYS SAID, WE NEED TO

02:56:21.938 --> 02:56:23.372
HAVE OUR CITIES AT THE TABLE

02:56:23.439 --> 02:56:24.840
BECAUSE THERE'S SOME REALLY GOOD

02:56:24.907 --> 02:56:26.409
ACTORS, AND OF COURSE, THERE'S

02:56:26.475 --> 02:56:27.009
SOME BAD ACTORS. BUT WE ALSO

02:56:27.076 --> 02:56:28.744
NEED TO PRAISE EVERYTHING THAT

02:56:28.811 --> 02:56:31.614
OUR GOOD, HARDWORKING CITY

02:56:31.681 --> 02:56:33.049
COUNCILS AND MAYORS ARE DOING

02:56:33.115 --> 02:56:35.384
WITHIN L.A. COUNTY. SO I COMMEND

02:56:35.451 --> 02:56:36.919
YOU BECAUSE I KNOW THIS IS

02:56:36.986 --> 02:56:37.653
SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE BEEN

02:56:37.720 --> 02:56:39.889
WORKING ON. THIS IS YOUR

02:56:39.956 --> 02:56:41.357
PASSION, AND I'M HOPING THAT WE

02:56:41.424 --> 02:56:43.392
CAN GET THIS TO A BETTER, BETTER

02:56:43.459 --> 02:56:44.927
PLACE. SO THAT WAY I CAN SUPPORT

02:56:44.994 --> 02:56:47.063
IT ALSO ON THE FLOOR. BUT I DO

02:56:47.129 --> 02:56:48.264
APPRECIATE YOU VERY, VERY MUCH.

02:56:48.331 --> 02:56:50.032
AND I THINK YOU KNOW THIS, HOW

02:56:50.099 --> 02:56:51.400
MUCH I APPRECIATE YOU AND HOW

02:56:51.467 --> 02:56:53.970
MUCH I KNOW YOU WORK ON YOUR

02:56:54.036 --> 02:56:55.771
BILLS. SO I JUST WANT TO

02:56:55.838 --> 02:56:58.240
CONCLUDE WITH THAT. THANK YOU.

02:56:58.307 --> 02:56:59.709
AND I THINK THAT'S EVERYBODY

02:56:59.775 --> 02:57:01.143
THAT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO

02:57:01.210 --> 02:57:03.446
COMMENT. WE DO HAVE A FIRST AND

02:57:03.512 --> 02:57:05.181
A SECOND. WOULD YOU LIKE TO

02:57:05.247 --> 02:57:08.351
CLOSE, SENATOR? YES. THANK YOU,

02:57:08.417 --> 02:57:10.119
MR. CHAIR. I REALLY APPRECIATE

02:57:10.186 --> 02:57:10.920
THE CONVERSATION, COLLEAGUE,

02:57:10.987 --> 02:57:11.887
INCLUDING TO OUR COLLEAGUES WHO

02:57:11.954 --> 02:57:13.089
HAD TO RUN OFF TO OTHER

02:57:13.155 --> 02:57:17.960
COMMITTEES. SO, YOU KNOW, IN

02:57:18.027 --> 02:57:20.429
TERMS OF CITIES AND LOCAL

02:57:20.496 --> 02:57:21.964
CONTROL, I'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS

02:57:22.031 --> 02:57:24.166
A LOT OVER THE YEARS, AND I'M

02:57:24.233 --> 02:57:26.669
GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT A LITTLE

02:57:26.736 --> 02:57:28.738
BIT AGAIN. AND I SAY THIS AS

02:57:28.804 --> 02:57:30.639
SOMEONE WHO, IN ADDITION TO

02:57:30.706 --> 02:57:32.875
LIVING IN MY OWN NEIGHBORHOOD

02:57:32.942 --> 02:57:35.344
FOR THE LAST 28 YEARS, SO

02:57:35.411 --> 02:57:36.979
THERE'S A LOT OF LOVE FOR A LOT

02:57:37.046 --> 02:57:37.847
OF NEIGHBORHOODS AROUND THE

02:57:37.913 --> 02:57:39.982
CITY. AND I LOVE MY OWN

02:57:40.049 --> 02:57:41.317
NEIGHBORHOOD, WHICH IS A VERY

02:57:41.384 --> 02:57:42.852
HISTORIC NEIGHBORHOOD. THE

02:57:42.918 --> 02:57:45.021
CASTRO, EXTREMELY HISTORIC

02:57:45.087 --> 02:57:47.490
NEIGHBORHOOD. AND THE CASTRO IS

02:57:47.556 --> 02:57:51.427
ALSO A NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE AN

02:57:51.494 --> 02:57:52.495
ENORMOUS NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVE

02:57:52.561 --> 02:57:55.498
BEEN PUSHED OUT. AND IT'S GREAT

02:57:55.564 --> 02:57:56.966
THAT THE CASTRO HAS THE LOOK

02:57:57.033 --> 02:57:59.268
THAT IT HAS IN TERMS OF LET'S

02:57:59.335 --> 02:57:59.702
TALK ABOUT HISTORIC

02:57:59.769 --> 02:58:02.271
PRESERVATION, I LOVE THAT. I

02:58:02.338 --> 02:58:05.875
WOULD LOVE EVEN MORE IF ALL THE

02:58:05.941 --> 02:58:07.309
PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN PUSHED OUT OF

02:58:07.376 --> 02:58:09.812
THE CASTRO OVER THE YEARS WERE

02:58:09.879 --> 02:58:11.981
STILL THERE. THE LOOK AND FEEL

02:58:12.048 --> 02:58:12.681
OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD IS

02:58:12.748 --> 02:58:14.283
IMPORTANT, AND SO ARE THE PEOPLE

02:58:14.350 --> 02:58:15.818
THERE. AND WHAT WE'RE DOING

02:58:15.885 --> 02:58:17.653
RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA, BY

02:58:17.720 --> 02:58:20.189
VALUING EVERYTHING ELSE OVER

02:58:20.256 --> 02:58:23.259
HOUSING AFFORDABILITY. THE NEEDS

02:58:23.325 --> 02:58:25.394
OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT, THE LOOK

02:58:25.461 --> 02:58:27.463
AND FEEL OF A COMMUNITY, THE

02:58:27.530 --> 02:58:29.698
CHARACTER, QUOTE UNQUOTE, OF A

02:58:29.765 --> 02:58:34.870
COMMUNITY, PARKING, ETC. VIEWS.

02:58:34.937 --> 02:58:38.607
AS OPPOSED TO THAT, IT IS SO

02:58:38.674 --> 02:58:41.277
DAMN EXPENSIVE TO LIVE IN, NOT

02:58:41.343 --> 02:58:42.812
JUST PLACES LIKE SAN FRANCISCO,

02:58:42.878 --> 02:58:44.346
BUT ALL OVER THE STATE. WE ALL

02:58:44.413 --> 02:58:46.615
FEEL IT. I KNOW THAT ALL OF US

02:58:46.682 --> 02:58:49.051
FEEL IT, THAT WE ARE PUSHING THE

02:58:49.118 --> 02:58:51.954
FABRIC OUT OF THE STATE. IN SOME

02:58:52.021 --> 02:58:54.256
WAYS, PEOPLE WHO, LIKE, DO NOT

02:58:54.323 --> 02:58:56.225
SEE A FUTURE FOR THEMSELVES IN

02:58:56.292 --> 02:58:57.626
THIS STATE. YOUNG FAMILIES WHO

02:58:57.693 --> 02:59:00.329
ARE LIKE, HOW AM I EVER GOING TO

02:59:00.396 --> 02:59:01.297
AFFORD HOUSING? BECAUSE IF YOU

02:59:01.363 --> 02:59:04.433
HAVE A SECOND KID AND THAT IS

02:59:04.500 --> 02:59:06.969
HAPPENING EVERY DAY IN THE CITY,

02:59:07.036 --> 02:59:08.737
THAT PEOPLE ARE MAKING CHOICES,

02:59:08.804 --> 02:59:11.107
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

02:59:11.173 --> 02:59:13.609
ADDRESS. AND I STARTED OUT AS A

02:59:13.676 --> 02:59:14.977
NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION

02:59:15.044 --> 02:59:17.113
PRESIDENT. I SERVED IN LOCAL

02:59:17.179 --> 02:59:19.615
GOVERNMENT. I CARED DEEPLY ABOUT

02:59:19.682 --> 02:59:21.117
NEIGHBORHOODS AND LOCAL

02:59:21.183 --> 02:59:22.318
GOVERNMENT AND A NUMBER OF BILLS

02:59:22.384 --> 02:59:25.121
THAT I DO TRY TO GIVE CITIES

02:59:25.187 --> 02:59:27.656
MORE LOCAL CONTROL OVER THINGS.

02:59:27.723 --> 02:59:28.858
SOMETIMES THE CITIES FIGHT ME ON

02:59:28.924 --> 02:59:30.226
GIVING THEM LOCAL CONTROL, TOO,

02:59:30.292 --> 02:59:32.128
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO MAKE

02:59:32.194 --> 02:59:33.129
THE DECISIONS. WE'LL PUT THAT

02:59:33.195 --> 02:59:34.763
ISSUE ASIDE. I BELIEVE THAT IN

02:59:34.830 --> 02:59:36.265
THE VAST MAJORITY OF

02:59:36.332 --> 02:59:38.334
CIRCUMSTANCES, CITIES ARE BEST

02:59:38.400 --> 02:59:39.969
POSITIONED TO MAKE DECISIONS

02:59:40.035 --> 02:59:42.071
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN THEIR

02:59:42.138 --> 02:59:43.038
COMMUNITY. ABSOLUTELY. WE HAVE

02:59:43.105 --> 02:59:45.241
HAD A SYSTEM UNTIL ONLY LIKE THE

02:59:45.307 --> 02:59:47.776
LAST TEN YEARS, OF ALMOST PURE

02:59:47.843 --> 02:59:49.879
LOCAL CONTROL OF HOUSING IN

02:59:49.945 --> 02:59:51.080
CALIFORNIA, WHERE CITIES MADE

02:59:51.147 --> 02:59:52.515
ALL THOSE DECISIONS, AND OVER

02:59:52.581 --> 02:59:55.384
THAT PERIOD, THE COST OF HOUSING

02:59:55.451 --> 02:59:56.819
EXPLODED BECAUSE CITIES LIKE MY

02:59:56.886 --> 02:59:59.021
OWN SAN FRANCISCO DID NOT BUILD

02:59:59.088 --> 03:00:00.723
ENOUGH HOUSING AND MADE IT

03:00:00.789 --> 03:00:02.925
EXTREMELY HARD AND ARDUOUS TO

03:00:02.992 --> 03:00:04.360
ACTUALLY GET HOUSING APPROVED,

03:00:04.426 --> 03:00:07.229
LET ALONE ZONED FOR IT. AND WHAT

03:00:07.296 --> 03:00:08.931
WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE, THIS IS

03:00:08.998 --> 03:00:10.733
NOT A SILVER BULLET OR GLOBAL

03:00:10.799 --> 03:00:11.667
SOLUTION. IT ACTUALLY, I

03:00:11.734 --> 03:00:13.002
APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING UP SB50,

03:00:13.068 --> 03:00:14.737
AND I DO REMEMBER THAT BUS TOUR.

03:00:14.803 --> 03:00:16.639
IT WAS REALLY HELPFUL, AND I'M

03:00:16.705 --> 03:00:17.273
VERY APPRECIATIVE THAT YOU ALL

03:00:17.339 --> 03:00:20.009
TOOK THE TIME TO TAKE ME AROUND.

03:00:20.075 --> 03:00:21.610
THIS BILL IS A SMALL PERCENTAGE

03:00:21.677 --> 03:00:24.914
OF SB 50. SB 50 COVERED A BIG

03:00:24.980 --> 03:00:26.949
SWATH OF THE STATE. THIS IS

03:00:27.016 --> 03:00:29.318
MUCH, MUCH MORE LIMITED. AND WE

03:00:29.385 --> 03:00:30.686
TALK A LOT ABOUT WHERE WE DON'T

03:00:30.753 --> 03:00:32.721
WANT TO BUILD HOUSING IN

03:00:32.788 --> 03:00:34.590
CALIFORNIA, LIKE IN THE HIGHEST

03:00:34.657 --> 03:00:36.458
WILDFIRE SEVERITY ZONES, OR SOME

03:00:36.525 --> 03:00:37.793
PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO BUILD IN

03:00:37.860 --> 03:00:40.062
THE COASTAL ZONE. WE NEED TO

03:00:40.129 --> 03:00:42.097
TALK MORE ABOUT WHERE WE DO WANT

03:00:42.164 --> 03:00:43.933
TO BUILD MORE HOUSING, AND IT'S

03:00:43.999 --> 03:00:45.301
HARD TO THINK OF A BETTER PLACE

03:00:45.367 --> 03:00:47.036
TO PUT MORE HOUSING THAN AROUND

03:00:47.102 --> 03:00:48.971
THE BEST PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION

03:00:49.038 --> 03:00:49.939
STOPS. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL

03:00:50.005 --> 03:00:52.308
DOES. I THINK IT'S WORTHY OF

03:00:52.374 --> 03:00:52.942
SUPPORT. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK

03:00:53.008 --> 03:00:55.611
FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU,

03:00:55.678 --> 03:00:56.979

COLLEAGUES. I APPRECIATE THE

DISCUSSION TODAY. ALL RIGHT. AND

03:02:17.960 --> 03:02:19.295
WITH THAT, WE'RE GOING TO GO

03:02:19.361 --> 03:02:23.532
BACK TO FILE ORDER ITEM NUMBER

03:02:23.599 --> 03:02:24.867
THREE, SB FIVE BY SENATOR

03:02:24.933 --> 03:02:29.505
CABALDON. THANK YOU. GOOD TO SEE

03:02:29.571 --> 03:02:30.639

03:02:35.944 --> 03:02:38.781
YOU? ALL RIGHT. GOOD AFTERNOON.

03:02:38.847 --> 03:02:40.816
I HAVE THE MAIN EVENT OF THE

03:02:40.883 --> 03:02:45.621
DAY, SB FIVE. THANK YOU, MR.

03:02:45.688 --> 03:02:51.360
CHAIR. JUST PARDON ME A SECOND

03:02:51.427 --> 03:02:52.328
ALREADY. SO WHENEVER YOU'RE

03:02:52.394 --> 03:02:54.330
READY. OKAY. THANK YOU. YEAH.

03:02:54.396 --> 03:02:56.098
I'M HERE TO PRESENT SB FIVE,

03:02:56.165 --> 03:02:58.600
WHICH HAS THE TWO PURPOSES TO

03:02:58.667 --> 03:03:00.469
RESCUE TWO CRITICAL PROGRAMS FOR

03:03:00.536 --> 03:03:02.204
CALIFORNIA FOR WHICH A

03:03:02.271 --> 03:03:03.639
SIGNIFICANT LOOPHOLE HAS

03:03:03.706 --> 03:03:05.107
EMERGED. THE FIRST IS THE

03:03:05.174 --> 03:03:06.775
WILLIAMSON ACT, WHICH IS THE

03:03:06.842 --> 03:03:07.943
STATE'S PREMIER PROGRAM TO

03:03:08.010 --> 03:03:10.012
PROTECT FARMLAND IN CALIFORNIA.

03:03:10.079 --> 03:03:11.513
AND THE WILLIAMSON ACT OPERATES

03:03:11.580 --> 03:03:14.316
BY PROVIDING A LOWER TAX

03:03:14.383 --> 03:03:16.218
ASSESSMENT LEVEL. NOT A RATE,

03:03:16.285 --> 03:03:17.953
BUT THE ACTUAL ASSESSMENT IS

03:03:18.020 --> 03:03:19.388
HELD TO A LOWER LEVEL,

03:03:19.455 --> 03:03:21.490
ARTIFICIALLY DEPRESSED IN ORDER

03:03:21.557 --> 03:03:23.058
TO ENCOURAGE AND SUPPORT FARMERS

03:03:23.125 --> 03:03:24.827
TO KEEP THEIR PROPERTIES IN

03:03:24.893 --> 03:03:26.161
FARMING. IF YOU CHOOSE TO TAKE

03:03:26.228 --> 03:03:28.430
THAT PARCEL OUT, YOU PAY A

03:03:28.497 --> 03:03:31.667
PENALTY OF 12.5%. THE CHALLENGE

03:03:31.734 --> 03:03:33.135
THAT THE LOOPHOLE I'M ABOUT TO

03:03:33.202 --> 03:03:35.571
DESCRIBE PRESENTS IS THAT BY

03:03:35.637 --> 03:03:36.505
EXPLOITING A LOOPHOLE IN A

03:03:36.572 --> 03:03:38.807
DIFFERENT FINANCING PROGRAM, YOU

03:03:38.874 --> 03:03:42.010
CAN YOU CAN SECURE A PERMANENT

03:03:42.077 --> 03:03:43.879
FINANCING SOURCE THAT IS FAR IN

03:03:43.946 --> 03:03:46.749
EXCESS OF 12.5%. THE RESULT IS

03:03:46.815 --> 03:03:48.217
THAT WILLIAMSON ACT PARCELS,

03:03:48.283 --> 03:03:49.251
INSTEAD OF BEING PROTECTED BY

03:03:49.318 --> 03:03:51.420
THE WILLIAMSON ACT, MIGHT BE

03:03:51.487 --> 03:03:52.855
MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE

03:03:52.921 --> 03:03:54.189
DEVELOPED. EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE

03:03:54.256 --> 03:03:55.758
OF THE PURPOSE OF THE WILLIAMSON

03:03:55.824 --> 03:03:57.159
ACT. SO ONE HALF OF THE PURPOSE

03:03:57.226 --> 03:03:59.328
OF SB FIVE IS TO PROTECT THE

03:03:59.395 --> 03:04:00.162
BASIC INTEGRITY OF THE

03:04:00.229 --> 03:04:01.063
WILLIAMSON ACT. THE SECOND

03:04:01.130 --> 03:04:02.898
PURPOSE IS TO PROTECT THE

03:04:02.965 --> 03:04:04.266
INTEGRITY OF THE ENHANCED

03:04:04.333 --> 03:04:05.801
INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING

03:04:05.868 --> 03:04:07.302
DISTRICT METHODOLOGY, WHICH IS,

03:04:07.369 --> 03:04:09.204
I KNOW, A GREAT CONCERN AND

03:04:09.271 --> 03:04:11.540
CAUSE FOR THE CHAIR ME TO MY OWN

03:04:11.607 --> 03:04:12.941
CITY. I WAS THE CHAIR OF THE

03:04:13.008 --> 03:04:15.511
FIRST AID IN THE STATE, WHICH

03:04:15.577 --> 03:04:16.311
JUST ISSUED OVER NEARLY $100

03:04:16.378 --> 03:04:17.312
MILLION IN THE LAST COUPLE OF

03:04:17.379 --> 03:04:21.817
MONTHS. THAT THAT PROJECT IS

03:04:21.884 --> 03:04:23.419
IMPERILED BY THIS LOOPHOLE,

03:04:23.485 --> 03:04:24.820
WHICH ALLOWS FOR WILLIAMSON ACT

03:04:24.887 --> 03:04:26.989
PROPERTIES GO DIRECTLY INTO AN

03:04:27.055 --> 03:04:28.123
ENHANCED INFRASTRUCTURE

03:04:28.190 --> 03:04:29.525
FINANCING DISTRICT WITHOUT FIRST

03:04:29.591 --> 03:04:31.760
BEING REASSESSED FOR THEIR NON

03:04:31.827 --> 03:04:34.296
WILLIAMSON ACT VALUE. IT'S

03:04:34.363 --> 03:04:35.030
UNDERSTANDABLE WHY A DEVELOPER

03:04:35.097 --> 03:04:36.331
WOULD WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

03:04:36.398 --> 03:04:37.966
THIS, BUT THE CHALLENGE AND THE

03:04:38.033 --> 03:04:39.234
REASON WHY I'M HERE WITH THIS

03:04:39.301 --> 03:04:40.636
BILL TODAY FOR THE Â PROCESS

03:04:40.702 --> 03:04:42.538
AND FOR TAX INCREMENT FINANCING

03:04:42.604 --> 03:04:43.739
GENERALLY, I'M OLD ENOUGH TO

03:04:43.806 --> 03:04:45.441
REMEMBER REDEVELOPMENT, AS I

03:04:45.507 --> 03:04:46.842
KNOW A COUPLE OF CHAIRS

03:04:46.909 --> 03:04:49.411
CERTAINLY IS AS WELL. AND

03:04:49.478 --> 03:04:51.180
REDEVELOPMENT WE LOST IN PART

03:04:51.246 --> 03:04:53.882
BECAUSE OF A SERIES OF LOOPHOLES

03:04:53.949 --> 03:04:56.185
AND EXPLOITATIONS AROUND THE

03:04:56.251 --> 03:04:58.420
EDGES THAT UNDERMINED PUBLIC AND

03:04:58.487 --> 03:04:59.455
LEGISLATIVE SUPPORT FOR THE

03:04:59.521 --> 03:05:01.290
PROGRAM, AND AN UNDERSTANDING

03:05:01.356 --> 03:05:03.158
THAT WHILE IT WAS CRITICAL TO

03:05:03.225 --> 03:05:04.593
BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING, TO

03:05:04.660 --> 03:05:05.694
REVITALIZING DOWNTOWNS, TO

03:05:05.761 --> 03:05:07.229
BUILDING OUT COMMUNITY PLANS,

03:05:07.296 --> 03:05:09.231
THAT THERE WERE ACTORS WHO WERE

03:05:09.298 --> 03:05:10.399
DOING THINGS THAT WEREN'T ALWAYS

03:05:10.466 --> 03:05:12.201
ILLEGAL BUT DEFINITELY THREATEN

03:05:12.267 --> 03:05:13.836
THE FUNDAMENTAL PURPOSE OF IT.

03:05:13.902 --> 03:05:16.605
AND SO WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN A CASE

03:05:16.672 --> 03:05:18.207
RECENTLY IS THE USE OF AN

03:05:18.273 --> 03:05:19.341
ENHANCED INFRASTRUCTURE

03:05:19.408 --> 03:05:20.709
FINANCING DISTRICT IN A

03:05:20.776 --> 03:05:22.811
WILLIAMSON ACT PARCEL IN ORDER

03:05:22.878 --> 03:05:25.013
TO MAXIMIZE THE DEVELOPMENT

03:05:25.080 --> 03:05:27.149
POTENTIAL OF A PARCEL, BUT ALSO

03:05:27.216 --> 03:05:28.984
TO UNDERMINE THE WILLIAMSON ACT

03:05:29.051 --> 03:05:29.918
EFFECTIVENESS. I WANT TO THANK

03:05:29.985 --> 03:05:32.354
THE CHAIR FOR ALL OF THE ADVICE

03:05:32.421 --> 03:05:34.056
AND COUNSEL AND FEEDBACK ON

03:05:34.122 --> 03:05:36.058
THIS. THE BILL HAS HAD

03:05:36.124 --> 03:05:36.825
OPPOSITION FROM THE BUILDING

03:05:36.892 --> 03:05:38.026
INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION, WHO I'M

03:05:38.093 --> 03:05:40.062
SURE WE'LL HEAR FROM, WORK VERY

03:05:40.128 --> 03:05:41.563
CLOSELY WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER

03:05:41.630 --> 03:05:43.332
WILSON, WHO REPRESENTS THE SAME

03:05:43.398 --> 03:05:45.501
COMMUNITY THAT I DO, WHERE THIS

03:05:45.567 --> 03:05:47.436
BECAME AN ISSUE. WE WORKED

03:05:47.503 --> 03:05:49.238
COLLABORATIVELY TO TRY TO GET AT

03:05:49.304 --> 03:05:50.205
THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES OF THE

03:05:50.272 --> 03:05:51.874
BIA HAS EXPRESSED. THE LANGUAGE

03:05:51.940 --> 03:05:53.141
THAT'S IN THE BILL TODAY

03:05:53.208 --> 03:05:55.277
REFLECTS THAT, THAT THAT WORK

03:05:55.344 --> 03:05:56.912
WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER WILSON AND

03:05:56.979 --> 03:05:58.981
ASSURES THAT IT'S ABSOLUTELY

03:05:59.047 --> 03:06:00.182
FINE TO TAKE THE WILLIAMSON ACT

03:06:00.249 --> 03:06:02.551
OUT OF THE PARCEL, OUT OF THE

03:06:02.618 --> 03:06:04.086
WILLIAMSON ACT AND PUT IT INTO

03:06:04.152 --> 03:06:04.920
AN IFD, BUT YOU STILL WOULD NEED

03:06:04.987 --> 03:06:06.722
UNDER THE BILL TO HAVE IT

03:06:06.788 --> 03:06:09.191
ASSESSED ONE MORE TIME PRIOR TO

03:06:09.258 --> 03:06:11.159
THAT ACTION OCCURRING. AND SO

03:06:11.226 --> 03:06:13.328
THIS IS A NARROW BILL IN TERMS

03:06:13.395 --> 03:06:14.963
OF ITS APPLICATION STATEWIDE AT

03:06:15.030 --> 03:06:16.198
THE MOMENT. BUT IT'S AN

03:06:16.265 --> 03:06:17.633
IMPORTANT LOOPHOLE TO CATCH

03:06:17.699 --> 03:06:19.902
EARLY. AND THE BILL IS CRITICAL

03:06:19.968 --> 03:06:20.869
TO THE CONTINUED SUCCESS AND

03:06:20.936 --> 03:06:22.404
EFFICACY OF BOTH THE WILLIAMSON

03:06:22.471 --> 03:06:23.672
ACT AND THE ENHANCED

03:06:23.739 --> 03:06:24.573
INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING

03:06:24.640 --> 03:06:25.908
DISTRICT BILL. SO AT THE

03:06:25.974 --> 03:06:27.009
APPROPRIATE TIME, I'D LIKE TO

03:06:27.075 --> 03:06:28.277
ASK FOR A VOTE, HAVE TWO

03:06:28.343 --> 03:06:29.912
WITNESSES WITH ME IN SUPPORT.

03:06:29.978 --> 03:06:31.446
FIRST, I WANT TO INTRODUCE,

03:06:31.513 --> 03:06:32.481
EXCUSE ME, INTRODUCE JORDAN FROM

THE PAST 67 YEARS TO PROTECT THE

IS, AT ITS CORE, A GOOD

03:06:58.640 --> 03:07:00.842
GOVERNANCE MEASURE THAT EMBODIES

03:07:11.920 --> 03:07:13.055
ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST

03:07:13.121 --> 03:07:15.123
EFFECTIVE TOOLS FOR PRESERVING

03:07:15.190 --> 03:07:16.224
AGRICULTURAL LANDS AND OPEN

03:07:16.291 --> 03:07:18.126

03:07:18.193 --> 03:07:20.162

03:07:20.228 --> 03:07:21.897
SB FIVE PROTECTS THE INTEGRITY

03:07:21.964 --> 03:07:23.165

REZONED FOR NONAGRICULTURAL USE.

03:07:42.884 --> 03:07:45.020
THESE PROVISIONS STRENGTHEN BOTH

03:07:45.087 --> 03:07:46.388
FARMLAND CONSERVATION EFFORTS

03:07:46.455 --> 03:07:49.625

POLICY AND PROGRAMS AT CASITA

03:16:25.273 --> 03:16:27.509
COALITION. WE ARE A STATEWIDE

03:16:27.575 --> 03:16:29.010
NONPROFIT THAT REMOVES BARRIERS

03:16:29.077 --> 03:16:30.145
TO BUILDING SMALLER AND MORE

03:16:30.211 --> 03:16:32.480
AFFORDABLE HOMES. MY BACKGROUND

03:16:32.547 --> 03:16:34.415
IS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT. I SERVED

03:16:34.482 --> 03:16:36.451
AS A MUNICIPAL URBAN PLANNER AND

03:16:36.518 --> 03:16:38.553
CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICER IN LOS

03:16:38.620 --> 03:16:41.156
ANGELES COUNTY FOR 14 YEARS.

03:16:41.222 --> 03:16:43.158
FROM THAT EXPERIENCE, I KNOW THE

03:16:43.224 --> 03:16:45.126
CHALLENGES OF NAVIGATING ZONING

03:16:45.193 --> 03:16:47.162
CODES AND CODE COMPLIANCE ON THE

03:16:47.228 --> 03:16:49.364
GROUND. I'VE SEEN BOTH

03:16:49.430 --> 03:16:51.266
HOMEOWNERS AND LOCAL AGENCY

03:16:51.332 --> 03:16:53.234
PLANNERS STRUGGLE TO INTERPRET

03:16:53.301 --> 03:16:56.304
COMPLEX CODES THAT LACK CLEAR

03:16:56.371 --> 03:16:58.373
INTENT. CASITA COALITION IS

03:16:58.439 --> 03:17:00.475
SPONSORING SB 543 TO ADD CLARITY

03:17:00.542 --> 03:17:03.378
AND CONSISTENCY IN THE LAW

03:17:03.444 --> 03:17:04.712
STATEWIDE. MANY LOCAL AGENCIES

03:17:04.779 --> 03:17:07.315
ARE ENCOURAGING MORE ADUS AND

03:17:07.382 --> 03:17:09.584
JADA'S TO MEET URGENT HOUSING

03:17:09.651 --> 03:17:11.186
NEEDS. BUT WE KNOW CALIFORNIA IS

03:17:11.252 --> 03:17:13.955
A BIG STATE. SOME LOCAL

03:17:14.022 --> 03:17:15.356
JURISDICTIONS LACK UP TO DATE

03:17:15.423 --> 03:17:18.126
ADU LAWS OR INCONSISTENTLY

03:17:18.193 --> 03:17:19.961
INTERPRET ADU AND JADU

03:17:20.028 --> 03:17:21.729
PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS,

03:17:21.796 --> 03:17:24.132
RESULTING IN UNEVEN APPROVALS

03:17:24.199 --> 03:17:26.434
AND CONFUSION THAT FALLS HARDEST

03:17:26.501 --> 03:17:28.937
ON SMALL BUILDERS, HOMEOWNERS OF

03:17:29.003 --> 03:17:30.772
MODEST MEANS AND TENANTS IN NEED

03:17:30.838 --> 03:17:33.641
OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SB 543

03:17:33.708 --> 03:17:35.276
CLEANS UP STATE LAW PROVISIONS

03:17:35.343 --> 03:17:37.345
SO THAT JUNIOR ADUS HAVE THE

03:17:37.412 --> 03:17:39.847
SAME RULES AND PROTECTIONS AS

03:17:39.914 --> 03:17:41.783
ADUS. IT WILL CLARIFY FREQUENTLY

03:17:41.849 --> 03:17:43.785
CONFUSED POINTS, SO THE INTENT

03:17:43.851 --> 03:17:45.853
OF STATE LAW IS CLEAR.

03:17:45.920 --> 03:17:47.689
SPECIFICALLY, SB 543 WILL

03:17:47.755 --> 03:17:49.824

JURISDICTION TO UNDERSTAND AND

IMPLEMENT ON THE LOCAL LEVEL.

03:18:06.007 --> 03:18:07.508
THIS IS A CLEANUP BILL THAT

03:18:07.575 --> 03:18:09.577
PROVIDES CLARITY AND CONSISTENCY

03:18:09.644 --> 03:18:11.546
IN THE PERMITTING PROCESS TO

BUILDERS USE STATE LAWS AS

03:18:17.685 --> 03:18:18.987

SUPPORTIVE HOUSING THAT GO

03:21:04.252 --> 03:21:06.421

03:21:06.487 --> 03:21:08.556

SENIOR POPULATION THAT OFTEN

03:21:20.935 --> 03:21:23.638
LIVED ON A FIXED INCOME. MOST

03:21:23.704 --> 03:21:26.240
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS CAN ACTUALLY

03:21:26.307 --> 03:21:28.776
CHOOSE TO APPLY FOR A PRO

03:21:28.843 --> 03:21:29.444
HOUSING DESIGNATION. THAT'S HOW

03:21:29.510 --> 03:21:31.746
IT TYPICALLY WORKS, AND IT ALSO

03:21:31.813 --> 03:21:33.614
OFFERS A LOT OF TECHNICAL

03:21:33.681 --> 03:21:34.882
ASSISTANCE AND POTENTIALLY EVEN

03:21:34.949 --> 03:21:36.717
FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. JUST

03:21:36.784 --> 03:21:38.619
RECENTLY, IN THE PAST FOUR

03:21:38.686 --> 03:21:40.655

IN OUR DISTRICT GET THE PRO

03:21:43.891 --> 03:21:45.092
HOUSING DESIGNATION. THEY ARE

03:21:45.159 --> 03:21:47.228
SMALLER CITIES THAT REALLY HAVE

03:21:47.295 --> 03:21:49.030
A HARD TIME COMPETING WITH SOME

03:21:49.096 --> 03:21:51.332
OF THE FUNDING OUT THERE, AND

03:21:51.399 --> 03:21:54.302
MUCH MORE. SO THESE TYPES OF

03:21:54.368 --> 03:21:54.936
DESIGNATIONS ARE SMALLER CITIES

03:21:55.002 --> 03:21:57.572
COMPETE AND CREATE HOUSING.

03:21:57.638 --> 03:21:59.507

ABSURD OUTCOME AND DOES NOT

03:28:20.588 --> 03:28:22.256
FURTHER THE PURPOSE OF THE LAW.

03:28:22.323 --> 03:28:23.757

03:28:35.970 --> 03:28:38.239
TO THEIR MIXED USE PROJECTS AND

03:28:38.305 --> 03:28:39.306

03:38:03.703 --> 03:38:05.739
YOU VERY MUCH, MR. CHAIR AND

03:38:05.806 --> 03:38:09.643
MEMBERS. I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY

03:38:09.709 --> 03:38:10.811
ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE

03:38:10.877 --> 03:38:12.012
AMENDMENTS AND THANK THE CHAIR

03:38:12.078 --> 03:38:13.380
AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR

03:38:13.447 --> 03:38:16.349
WORKING ON THIS BILL. THIS BILL

03:38:16.416 --> 03:38:18.351
IS THE CLEAN ENERGY SAFETY ACT

03:38:18.418 --> 03:38:21.588
OF 2025, WHICH IS ENSURES THE

03:38:21.655 --> 03:38:25.192
SAFE DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATION

03:38:25.258 --> 03:38:27.961
OF LARGE BATTERY STORAGE

03:38:28.028 --> 03:38:30.230
FACILITIES. MANY OF YOU MIGHT BE

03:38:30.297 --> 03:38:32.732
FAMILIAR THAT THERE WAS A MAJOR

03:38:32.799 --> 03:38:34.801
FIRE AND INCIDENT AT THE MOSS

03:38:34.868 --> 03:38:36.803
LANDING BATTERY STORAGE FACILITY

03:38:36.870 --> 03:38:38.839
IN JANUARY. THAT'S IN MY

03:38:38.905 --> 03:38:41.441
DISTRICT. IT WAS ONE OF THE

03:38:41.508 --> 03:38:44.411
EARLIEST BATTERY STORAGE, WHICH,

03:38:44.478 --> 03:38:46.313
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, IS ONLY 7 OR

03:38:46.379 --> 03:38:48.582
8 YEARS AGO NOW. AND IT WAS

03:38:48.648 --> 03:38:51.585
GETTING TO THE POINT THAT

03:38:51.651 --> 03:38:53.620
BETWEEN THE OVER THE FENCE WITH

03:38:53.687 --> 03:38:55.755
PG AND E, AND THERE IT WAS,

03:38:55.822 --> 03:38:58.692
750MW. WHEN WE STARTED WITH

03:38:58.758 --> 03:39:02.529
BATTERY STORAGE IN THAT YEAR OF

03:39:02.596 --> 03:39:05.999
2018 AND 2019, WE ONLY HAD 500MW

03:39:06.066 --> 03:39:08.001
IN THE ENTIRE STATE OF

03:39:08.068 --> 03:39:12.405
CALIFORNIA, WE HAVE ROUGHLY

03:39:12.472 --> 03:39:14.140
13,200 OR 300 NOW. AND THE GOAL

03:39:14.207 --> 03:39:17.644
IS TO HAVE 52,000 BY THE TIME WE

03:39:17.711 --> 03:39:19.679
HOPE TO BE CLOSE TO CARBON

03:39:19.746 --> 03:39:23.149
NEUTRAL IN 2045. THE TECHNOLOGY

03:39:23.216 --> 03:39:28.889
HAS MOVED VERY FAST. AND YET THE

03:39:28.955 --> 03:39:30.757
LAWS AND THE PRACTICES HAVEN'T

03:39:30.824 --> 03:39:32.792
TOTALLY CAUGHT UP. THE MOSS

03:39:32.859 --> 03:39:34.661
LANDING FACILITY WAS A

03:39:34.728 --> 03:39:36.196
TECHNOLOGY THAT WE PROBABLY

03:39:36.263 --> 03:39:40.400
WOULDN'T APPROVE NOW. IT WAS

03:39:40.467 --> 03:39:42.869
INSIDE. IT WAS BATTERY STACKED

03:39:42.936 --> 03:39:45.839
AND THE EUPHEMISM IS THERMAL

03:39:45.906 --> 03:39:49.042
RUNAWAY. SO WHEN IT STARTED,

03:39:49.109 --> 03:39:53.346
THAT FIRE JUST RAN. AND THE

03:39:53.413 --> 03:39:55.515
BATTERIES THAT WERE IN THAT

03:39:55.582 --> 03:39:58.018
OLDER TECHNOLOGY WERE LITHIUM,

03:39:58.084 --> 03:40:03.757
BUT THEY WERE WITH HEAVY METALS.

03:40:03.823 --> 03:40:05.592
MANGANESE, ZINC, COBALT. AND SO

03:40:05.659 --> 03:40:09.195
IN THE PLUME WERE HEAVY METALS.

03:40:09.262 --> 03:40:14.301
AND NOW IT IS MOSTLY A DIFFERENT

03:40:14.367 --> 03:40:15.468
CONFIGURATION THAT DOESN'T HAVE

03:40:15.535 --> 03:40:20.040
THE HEAVY METALS. AND 75% OF THE

03:40:20.106 --> 03:40:22.909
BATTERY STORAGE IS DONE IN WHAT

03:40:22.976 --> 03:40:26.880
IS A SAFER WAY, WHICH IS IN

03:40:26.947 --> 03:40:28.915
CONTAINERS, INDIVIDUALLY,

03:40:28.982 --> 03:40:33.019
OUTSIDE ON CEMENT SLABS. AND YET

03:40:33.086 --> 03:40:36.323
OUR RULES AND OUR LAWS HAVE NOT

03:40:36.389 --> 03:40:38.792
KEPT UP. THE MOSS LANDING WAS

03:40:38.858 --> 03:40:40.827
APPROVED TOTALLY BY LOCAL

03:40:40.894 --> 03:40:43.096
CONTROL, WITH NO GUIDANCE FROM

03:40:43.163 --> 03:40:46.566
THE STATE. AND WHEN THERE WAS AN

03:40:46.633 --> 03:40:48.401
INCIDENT WHERE THE FIRE

03:40:48.468 --> 03:40:51.371
SUPPRESSION SYSTEM KICKED OFF IN

03:40:51.438 --> 03:40:53.440
2022 AND THERE WAS NO FIRE.

03:40:53.506 --> 03:40:55.075
HIGHWAY ONE WAS STILL CLOSED FOR

03:40:55.141 --> 03:40:57.277
MOST OF THE DAY. PEOPLE

03:40:57.344 --> 03:40:58.945
SHELTERED IN PLACE. THEY WORRIED

03:40:59.012 --> 03:41:01.448
ABOUT A SO-CALLED CLOUD THAT WAS

03:41:01.514 --> 03:41:03.984
MOVING, AND I AUTHORED A BILL

03:41:04.050 --> 03:41:05.452
THAT REQUIRED SAFETY PLANS FOR

03:41:05.518 --> 03:41:07.687
BATTERY STORAGE THAT HAD TO BE

03:41:07.754 --> 03:41:10.090
FILED WITH CITIES OR COUNTIES.

03:41:10.156 --> 03:41:12.926
NOW, THIS BILL TRIES TO GIVE

03:41:12.993 --> 03:41:14.794
GUIDANCE, WHETHER IT'S THE LARGE

03:41:14.861 --> 03:41:16.329
INDUSTRIAL ONES WHERE THEY HAVE

03:41:16.396 --> 03:41:17.697
THE OPTION OF GOING THROUGH

03:41:17.764 --> 03:41:19.299
STATE PERMITTING WITH THE ENERGY

03:41:19.366 --> 03:41:21.234
COMMISSION, OR WHETHER IT IS

03:41:21.301 --> 03:41:24.771
STILL LOCAL CONTROL IN HOW IT IS

03:41:24.838 --> 03:41:28.041
DONE. AND SO THIS BILL BASICALLY

03:41:28.108 --> 03:41:30.276
SAYS YOU CANNOT BUILD INSIDE A

03:41:30.343 --> 03:41:32.345
COMBUSTIBLE BUILDING, THAT THE

03:41:32.412 --> 03:41:34.180
LITHIUM SAFETY STANDARDS WOULD

03:41:34.247 --> 03:41:36.016
FORMALLY BE ADOPTED AND

03:41:36.082 --> 03:41:38.785
INCORPORATED INTO, IN, INTO

03:41:38.852 --> 03:41:40.654
BUILDING STANDARDS, AND THAT

03:41:40.720 --> 03:41:43.590
THERE WOULD BE A STRUCTURED

03:41:43.657 --> 03:41:45.592
INVOLVEMENT OF FIRE SERVICE BOTH

03:41:45.659 --> 03:41:48.662
IN THE DESIGN AND IN THE

03:41:48.728 --> 03:41:50.397
INSPECTION AND CHECKING OUT

03:41:50.463 --> 03:41:54.367
BEFORE IT IS OPEN FOR OPERATION.

03:41:54.434 --> 03:41:56.369
AND THIS WAY, THE GUIDANCE THAT

03:41:56.436 --> 03:41:58.071
DOESN'T EXIST NOW, IF IT'S

03:41:58.138 --> 03:42:01.241
LOCALLY APPROVED OR EVEN IF IT'S

03:42:01.307 --> 03:42:02.175
APPROVED THROUGH THE STATE

03:42:02.242 --> 03:42:04.477
ENERGY COMMISSION, WE WOULD BE

03:42:04.544 --> 03:42:07.313
GIVING THEM GUIDANCE ON SAFETY

03:42:07.380 --> 03:42:09.015
TO HAVE THOSE THINGS THERE. AND

03:42:09.082 --> 03:42:12.719
THERE HAS BEEN A RESPONSE OUT OF

03:42:12.786 --> 03:42:14.854
THE FIRE. SO THE PUBLIC

03:42:14.921 --> 03:42:17.057
UTILITIES COMMISSION HAS ADOPTED

03:42:17.123 --> 03:42:19.125
SAFETY. THEY HAVE ADOPTED

03:42:19.192 --> 03:42:20.193
MONITORING, WHETHER THEY'RE

03:42:20.260 --> 03:42:22.362
ADHERING TO THE SAFETY PLAN BILL

03:42:22.429 --> 03:42:24.864
THAT WAS ADOPTED. BUT WHAT WE'RE

03:42:24.931 --> 03:42:29.002
REALLY DOING HERE IS TRYING TO

03:42:29.069 --> 03:42:32.172
HAVE OUR PROCESSES AND OUR

03:42:32.238 --> 03:42:34.240
GUIDANCE CATCH UP WITH WHERE THE

03:42:34.307 --> 03:42:38.978
TECHNOLOGY IS AND THE JUST IT'S

03:42:39.045 --> 03:42:40.080
INTERESTING BECAUSE I DON'T

03:42:40.146 --> 03:42:42.215
THINK 95% OF CALIFORNIANS KNEW

03:42:42.282 --> 03:42:44.084
WHAT BATTERY STORAGE WAS BEFORE

03:42:44.150 --> 03:42:47.887
THIS FIRE. AND IF WE REALLY HAVE

03:42:47.954 --> 03:42:51.891
TO MAKE WIND AND SOLAR WORK,

03:42:51.958 --> 03:42:53.727
IT'S THERE'S MANY TIMES WHEN THE

03:42:53.793 --> 03:42:55.161
SUN ISN'T SHINING OR THE WIND

03:42:55.228 --> 03:42:56.896
ISN'T BLOWING. AND THE ONLY WAY

03:42:56.963 --> 03:42:59.099
YOU HAVE RELIABILITY ON THE GRID

03:42:59.165 --> 03:43:01.000
IS TO HAVE THE BATTERY STORAGE

03:43:01.067 --> 03:43:02.602
TAKING THE EXCESS POWER, AND BE

03:43:02.669 --> 03:43:05.205
ABLE TO USE IT AT OTHER TIMES.

03:43:05.271 --> 03:43:07.407
SO THAT IS WHY BATTERY STORAGE

03:43:07.474 --> 03:43:11.911
IS VERY CRUCIAL FOR OUR

03:43:11.978 --> 03:43:14.380
RENEWABLE ENERGY. AND I WANT TO

03:43:14.447 --> 03:43:15.248
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FOR THE PEOPLE

03:43:15.315 --> 03:43:17.751
OF MOSS LANDING, THIS HAS BEEN A

03:43:17.817 --> 03:43:19.619
HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. THEY WERE

03:43:19.686 --> 03:43:21.855
EVACUATED FOR FOUR DAYS. HIGHWAY

03:43:21.921 --> 03:43:22.989
ONE WAS CLOSED FOR FOUR DAYS,

03:43:23.056 --> 03:43:25.358
WHICH IS A MAJOR ARTERIAL IN THE

03:43:25.425 --> 03:43:27.327
REGION. BUSINESSES ARE CLOSED.

03:43:27.393 --> 03:43:29.395
SOME HAVEN'T RECOVERED. THERE'S

03:43:29.462 --> 03:43:31.231
BEEN A BIG QUESTION ABOUT THE

03:43:31.297 --> 03:43:33.299
HEALTH AND SAFETY THAT RESULTED

03:43:33.366 --> 03:43:35.101
FROM THE HEAVY METALS AND THE

03:43:35.168 --> 03:43:36.569
PLUME. THAT IS STILL

03:43:36.636 --> 03:43:37.904
INVESTIGATIONS ARE STILL

03:43:37.971 --> 03:43:39.706
ONGOING. BUT I THINK WHAT WE

03:43:39.773 --> 03:43:42.375
HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO IS TO

03:43:42.442 --> 03:43:45.178
CONTROL THE SAFETY IN THIS. AND

03:43:45.245 --> 03:43:49.315
SO AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME, I

03:43:49.382 --> 03:43:51.451
WOULD ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE WITH

03:43:51.518 --> 03:43:54.220
ME IS DOUG SUBERS ON BEHALF OF

03:43:54.287 --> 03:43:55.655
THE PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS.

03:43:55.722 --> 03:43:58.424
AND DO YOU HAPPEN TO BE HERE ON

03:43:58.491 --> 03:43:59.125
BEHALF OF THE ELECTRICAL

03:43:59.192 --> 03:43:59.926
WORKERS? I AM MARTIN VIGIL ON

03:43:59.993 --> 03:44:01.861
BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE

03:44:01.928 --> 03:44:02.562
ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRIC PERFECT.

03:44:02.629 --> 03:44:04.964
SO THEY ARE MY TWO WITNESSES. AT

03:44:05.031 --> 03:44:07.367
THE APPROPRIATE TIME I WOULD

03:44:07.433 --> 03:44:08.668
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR. THANK YOU,

03:44:08.735 --> 03:44:10.236
SENATOR. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR

03:44:10.303 --> 03:44:11.237
AND MEMBERS. DOUG SUBERS, ON

03:44:11.304 --> 03:44:12.338
BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA

03:44:12.405 --> 03:44:13.373
PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS, WE'RE

03:44:13.439 --> 03:44:14.507
PLEASED TO CO-SPONSOR AND

03:44:14.574 --> 03:44:16.309
STRONGLY SUPPORT SB 283. I'D

03:44:16.376 --> 03:44:17.710
LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR

03:44:17.777 --> 03:44:18.845
BRINGING IT FORWARD IN THE

03:44:18.912 --> 03:44:19.946
COMMITTEE AND STAFF FOR ALL

03:44:20.013 --> 03:44:22.115
THEIR WORK ON THIS MEASURE. WE

03:44:22.182 --> 03:44:24.150
THINK THIS MEASURE AS AS

03:44:24.217 --> 03:44:24.651
DISCUSSED BY THE AUTHOR,

03:44:24.717 --> 03:44:25.518
REPRESENTS SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS

03:44:25.585 --> 03:44:26.753
AS IT RELATES TO FIRE SAFETY

03:44:26.820 --> 03:44:27.687
STANDARDS, COORDINATION AND

03:44:27.754 --> 03:44:28.788
INSPECTION STANDARDS AROUND

03:44:28.855 --> 03:44:29.989
BATTERY ENERGY STORAGE

03:44:30.056 --> 03:44:31.825
FACILITIES COVERED BY THE

03:44:31.891 --> 03:44:33.493
MEASURE. UNFORTUNATELY, WHEN

03:44:33.560 --> 03:44:35.628
THERE ARE FIRES AS DESCRIBED BY

03:44:35.695 --> 03:44:37.630
THE SENATOR, THEY CAN BE COMPLEX

03:44:37.697 --> 03:44:38.932
AND DIFFICULT TO EXTINGUISH AND

03:44:38.998 --> 03:44:41.067
PRESENT RISKS FOR FIREFIGHTERS.

03:44:41.134 --> 03:44:42.836
AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE, THERE WAS A

03:44:42.902 --> 03:44:44.470
BATTERY A FIRE AT A BATTERY

03:44:44.537 --> 03:44:45.138
ENERGY STORAGE FACILITY IN

03:44:45.205 --> 03:44:47.106
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT BURNED

03:44:47.173 --> 03:44:49.676
FOR EIGHT DAYS AND REQUIRED

03:44:49.742 --> 03:44:52.212
FIREFIGHTERS ON SCENE FOR OVER

03:44:52.278 --> 03:44:54.480
TWO WEEKS, AND THAT TYPE OF

03:44:54.547 --> 03:44:56.149
COMPLEX FIRE INCIDENT NOT ONLY

03:44:56.216 --> 03:44:56.983
REPRESENTS RISKS FOR OUR

03:44:57.050 --> 03:44:58.618
MEMBERS, BUT ALSO IMPACTS TO THE

03:44:58.685 --> 03:44:59.953
COMMUNITIES. AND SO THAT'S WHY

03:45:00.019 --> 03:45:02.355
WE THINK THAT THIS PROPOSAL

03:45:02.422 --> 03:45:02.889
PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT STEPS

03:45:02.956 --> 03:45:04.591
FORWARD IN IMPROVING SAFETY BY

03:45:04.657 --> 03:45:06.059
ENSURING THERE IS A MEET AND

03:45:06.125 --> 03:45:07.293
CONFER WITH THE FIRE AGENCY

03:45:07.360 --> 03:45:08.661
PRIOR TO THE APPLICATION

03:45:08.728 --> 03:45:10.997
PROCESS, AND THEN MAKING SURE

03:45:11.064 --> 03:45:13.032
THAT THE CALIFORNIA FIRE CODE,

03:45:13.099 --> 03:45:14.567
THE BUILDING CODE, AND THE

03:45:14.634 --> 03:45:17.103
ELECTRICAL CODE, ALONG WITH NFPA

03:45:17.170 --> 03:45:19.239
55, ARE THE STANDARDS THAT THE

03:45:19.305 --> 03:45:20.673
PROJECTS ARE BUILT TO. AND THEN

03:45:20.740 --> 03:45:22.408
HAVING AN INSPECTION BEFORE THE

03:45:22.475 --> 03:45:23.643
PROJECT STARTS UP TO ENSURE THAT

03:45:23.710 --> 03:45:24.911
THE SAFETY SYSTEMS ARE

03:45:24.978 --> 03:45:26.746
OPERATING. WE THINK THAT ONLY

03:45:26.813 --> 03:45:28.014
IMPROVES COMMUNITY SAFETY. IT

03:45:28.081 --> 03:45:29.315
ALSO IMPROVES FIREFIGHTER

03:45:29.382 --> 03:45:31.150
SAFETY. WE HAVE HAD MEMBERS WHO

03:45:31.217 --> 03:45:32.518
HAVE RESPONDED TO INCIDENTS

03:45:32.585 --> 03:45:34.287
WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN BATTERIES

03:45:34.354 --> 03:45:35.822
PRESENT, AND WE'VE HAD MEMBERS

03:45:35.889 --> 03:45:37.690
HAVE SIGNIFICANT INJURIES, AND

03:45:37.757 --> 03:45:40.126
WE'RE TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING WE

03:45:40.193 --> 03:45:41.027
CAN TO MITIGATE THAT RISK. AND

03:45:41.094 --> 03:45:42.562
FOR THOSE REASONS, WE

03:45:42.629 --> 03:45:45.632
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

03:45:45.698 --> 03:45:46.299

03:45:59.612 --> 03:46:01.247

SAFEGUARDING THESE PROJECTS

03:46:08.421 --> 03:46:09.055

TO PRESENT THIS BILL, SB 549,

03:49:26.786 --> 03:49:28.921
WHICH WHICH PROVIDES TWO VERY

03:49:28.988 --> 03:49:30.890
DIFFERENT TOOLS FOR LOCAL

03:49:30.957 --> 03:49:31.791
GOVERNMENTS TO WORK TOGETHER TO

03:49:31.858 --> 03:49:34.093
INVEST IN, IN COMMUNITIES AND

03:49:34.160 --> 03:49:36.729
REBUILD AFTER CLIMATE DISASTERS

03:49:36.796 --> 03:49:39.832
THERE. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS IS A

03:49:39.899 --> 03:49:41.534
STRANGE MASHUP JOB BECAUSE WE

03:49:41.601 --> 03:49:43.035
HAD AN EXISTING BILL WITH THIS

03:49:43.102 --> 03:49:45.938
NIFTY TWO MECHANISM THAT EXISTED

03:49:46.005 --> 03:49:46.973
BEFORE IN THE BILL THAT WE

03:49:47.039 --> 03:49:48.641
PASSED OUT OF THE SENATE. AND

03:49:48.708 --> 03:49:50.710
THEN AS A RESULT OF THE COUNTIES

03:49:50.776 --> 03:49:51.944
OF LOS ANGELES BLUE RIBBON

03:49:52.011 --> 03:49:53.880
COMMISSION, WE TRIED TO

03:49:53.946 --> 03:49:54.780
INCORPORATE THEIR

03:49:54.847 --> 03:49:56.082
RECOMMENDATIONS WITH REGARDS TO

03:49:56.149 --> 03:49:57.717
A REBUILDING, A RESILIENT

03:49:57.783 --> 03:49:58.818
REBUILDING AUTHORITY INTO THE

03:49:58.885 --> 03:50:00.653
BILL. I THINK IT'S LED TO SOME

03:50:00.720 --> 03:50:01.254
CONFUSION BECAUSE THERE'S TWO

03:50:01.320 --> 03:50:02.755
VERY DISTINCT PARTS OF THE BILL.

03:50:02.822 --> 03:50:05.024
BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FIRST

03:50:05.091 --> 03:50:05.925
PART, WHICH IS THE ORIGINAL PART

03:50:05.992 --> 03:50:08.161
OF THE BILL, WHICH WHICH CREATES

03:50:08.227 --> 03:50:09.529
NECESSARY FLEXIBILITY FOR LOCAL

03:50:09.595 --> 03:50:11.097
GOVERNMENTS TO WORK TOGETHER TO

03:50:11.164 --> 03:50:12.498
TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE

03:50:12.565 --> 03:50:13.866
SECOND NEIGHBORHOOD INFILL

03:50:13.933 --> 03:50:15.234
FINANCE AND TRANSIT

03:50:15.301 --> 03:50:17.803
IMPROVEMENTS. ACT NIFTY TWO

03:50:17.870 --> 03:50:19.739
NIFTY TWOS. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW,

03:50:19.805 --> 03:50:21.174
HAVING SERVED ON THIS COMMITTEE

03:50:21.240 --> 03:50:22.808
ARE A VOLUNTARY TYPE OF ENHANCED

03:50:22.875 --> 03:50:23.643
INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING

03:50:23.709 --> 03:50:25.044
DISTRICT FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

03:50:25.111 --> 03:50:26.445
TO FUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING,

03:50:26.512 --> 03:50:27.847
URBAN GREENING AND ACTIVE

03:50:27.914 --> 03:50:29.115
TRANSPORTATION ALONG TRANSIT

03:50:29.182 --> 03:50:30.383
CORRIDORS. NOW, CURRENTLY, THE

03:50:30.449 --> 03:50:32.251
BOUNDARY OF A NIFTY TWO DISTRICT

03:50:32.318 --> 03:50:33.719
MUST HAVE THE SAME BOUNDARY AS

03:50:33.786 --> 03:50:35.154
THE ESTABLISHING CITIES AND

03:50:35.221 --> 03:50:36.923
COUNTIES DUE TO THE WORKABILITY

03:50:36.989 --> 03:50:37.890
OF COLLECTING SALES TAX

03:50:37.957 --> 03:50:39.458
INCREMENT, BUT IT'S LED TO LOW

03:50:39.525 --> 03:50:41.227
ADOPTION OF THESE DISTRICTS. SO

03:50:41.294 --> 03:50:43.763
THIS BILL IN THIS PART OF THE

03:50:43.829 --> 03:50:45.498
BILL IS A VERY SMALL LITTLE

03:50:45.565 --> 03:50:46.666
CHANGE, WHICH IS THAT IT REMOVES

03:50:46.732 --> 03:50:48.467
THE ABILITY FOR ESTABLISHING

03:50:48.534 --> 03:50:49.602
ENTITIES TO USE SALES TAX

03:50:49.669 --> 03:50:50.970
INCREMENT IN THESE DISTRICTS,

03:50:51.037 --> 03:50:53.072
THEREBY ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR

03:50:53.139 --> 03:50:54.640
NIFTY TWO DISTRICTS TO SHARE THE

03:50:54.707 --> 03:50:55.675
BOUNDARIES OF ESTABLISHING

03:50:55.741 --> 03:50:56.676
ENTITIES, WHICH HAS BEEN

03:50:56.742 --> 03:50:58.211
IDENTIFIED AS A MAJOR BARRIER

03:50:58.277 --> 03:50:59.378
FOR THE UTILIZATION OF THE

03:50:59.445 --> 03:51:02.915
FINANCING TOOL. SO THAT'S THAT

03:51:02.982 --> 03:51:04.750
NIFTY TWO ISSUE. IT'S KIND OF A

03:51:04.817 --> 03:51:06.352
FIX OF A PREVIOUS LEGISLATION

03:51:06.419 --> 03:51:08.654
THAT I DID. THE SECOND PART OF

03:51:08.721 --> 03:51:12.925
THE BILL. THAT'S BOLDER AND

03:51:12.992 --> 03:51:16.596
QUITE FRANKLY NEEDS WORK IS THE

03:51:16.662 --> 03:51:18.164
IS THE ALLOWING OF A RESILIENT

03:51:18.231 --> 03:51:19.999
REBUILDING AUTHORITY TO RESPOND

03:51:20.066 --> 03:51:21.934
TO THE DISASTROUS WILDFIRES IN

03:51:22.001 --> 03:51:24.937
LOS ANGELES. LET ME JUST BE

03:51:25.004 --> 03:51:25.838
CLEAR. THE NIFTY TWO SECTION AND

03:51:25.905 --> 03:51:27.039
THE REBUILDING AUTHORITY

03:51:27.106 --> 03:51:28.708
SECTIONS OF THE BILL ARE NOT

03:51:28.774 --> 03:51:30.543
LINKED TO EACH OTHER. QUITE

03:51:30.610 --> 03:51:31.677
FRANKLY, IT WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE

03:51:31.744 --> 03:51:32.878
TO FUND AN AUTHORITY WITH THE

03:51:32.945 --> 03:51:35.248
NIFTY TWO DISTRICT DUE TO THEIR

03:51:35.314 --> 03:51:35.881
FORMATION REQUIREMENTS. AND SO

03:51:35.948 --> 03:51:38.084
ONE OF THE MANY THINGS I'M GOING

03:51:38.150 --> 03:51:38.985
TO COMMIT TO TODAY IS AMENDING

03:51:39.051 --> 03:51:40.219
LANGUAGE THAT WOULD MAKE THIS

03:51:40.286 --> 03:51:41.420
EXPLICIT. TO CLEAR UP ANY

03:51:41.487 --> 03:51:44.590
CONFUSION. YOU KNOW. BUT BUT BUT

03:51:44.657 --> 03:51:46.792
LET ME JUST SAY FROM A, FROM A

03:51:46.859 --> 03:51:47.560
TIMELINE PERSPECTIVE, THE REASON

03:51:47.627 --> 03:51:50.062
WHY WE'RE COMING OUT WITH THIS

03:51:50.129 --> 03:51:51.831
RESILIENT REBUILDING AUTHORITY

03:51:51.897 --> 03:51:53.633
PORTION OF THE BILL FOR THE VERY

03:51:53.699 --> 03:51:55.067
FIRST TIME WITH THIS, THIS

03:51:55.134 --> 03:51:56.902
HEARING IS BECAUSE IT'S AN IT'S

03:51:56.969 --> 03:51:58.504
AN IT'S AN INCORPORATION OF THE

03:51:58.571 --> 03:52:00.506
BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION'S REPORT

03:52:00.573 --> 03:52:02.541
THAT JUST CAME OUT A COUPLE OF

03:52:02.608 --> 03:52:05.478
WEEKS AGO. SO THE BLUE RIBBON

03:52:05.544 --> 03:52:06.946
COMMISSION, ESTABLISHED BY AT

03:52:07.013 --> 03:52:09.048
THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES WAS

03:52:09.115 --> 03:52:12.018
WAS TRYING TO LOOK AT THE

03:52:12.084 --> 03:52:13.419
CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH

03:52:13.486 --> 03:52:15.321
REBUILDING AFTER A DISASTER,

03:52:15.388 --> 03:52:16.756
WHICH WE KNOW IS EXPENSIVE,

03:52:16.822 --> 03:52:17.957
STRESSFUL AND TIME CONSUMING.

03:52:18.024 --> 03:52:19.058
THE MAGNITUDE OF THE IMPACTED

03:52:19.125 --> 03:52:20.126
AREA INTRODUCES CHALLENGES AND

03:52:20.192 --> 03:52:21.494
THE AVAILABILITY OF WORKFORCE

03:52:21.560 --> 03:52:22.895
AND CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS,

03:52:22.962 --> 03:52:24.163
WHICH MAY DRASTICALLY INCREASE

03:52:24.230 --> 03:52:26.232
COST TO REBUILD. AND THE BLUE

03:52:26.299 --> 03:52:27.867
RIBBON COMMISSION WENT OUT AND

03:52:27.933 --> 03:52:29.669
LOOKED AT MODELS ALL OVER THE

03:52:29.735 --> 03:52:33.172
COUNTRY FOR REBUILDING, AND THEY

03:52:33.239 --> 03:52:36.442
DECIDED THAT A CENTRAL AUTHORITY

03:52:36.509 --> 03:52:38.210
COULD HAVE A LOT OF PROMISE TO

03:52:38.277 --> 03:52:38.744
COORDINATE EFFORTS THROUGH

03:52:38.811 --> 03:52:39.712
DIFFERENT GOVERNMENTAL

03:52:39.779 --> 03:52:40.746
JURISDICTIONS AND PROVIDE A

03:52:40.813 --> 03:52:41.981
FASTER AND CHEAPER PATH FOR

03:52:42.048 --> 03:52:43.983
PEOPLE TO REBUILD. THIS IS

03:52:44.050 --> 03:52:45.051
SOMETHING THAT THEY SAW WITH

03:52:45.117 --> 03:52:46.886
HURRICANE KATRINA WITH NINE OVER

03:52:46.952 --> 03:52:48.788
11, AMONG OTHER DISASTERS THAT

03:52:48.854 --> 03:52:49.755
HELPED THOSE COMMUNITIES

03:52:49.822 --> 03:52:51.190
RECOVER, AND IN PARTICULAR,

03:52:51.257 --> 03:52:52.058
COORDINATING THE MASS PURCHASE

03:52:52.124 --> 03:52:53.726
OF CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS AND

03:52:53.793 --> 03:52:55.594
MANAGING LOCAL WORKFORCE COULD

03:52:55.661 --> 03:52:57.396
HELP EVERYONE IN THE REGION

03:52:57.463 --> 03:52:57.897
DURING AN UNPRECEDENTED

03:52:57.963 --> 03:52:59.065
REBUILDING EFFORT. SUCH AN

03:52:59.131 --> 03:53:00.232
AUTHORITY COULD ALSO PURCHASE

03:53:00.299 --> 03:53:02.368
PROPERTY AT FAIR MARKET VALUE TO

03:53:02.435 --> 03:53:03.436
GIVE FIRE VICTIMS FAIR

03:53:03.502 --> 03:53:04.203
COMPENSATION AND REBUILD THEIR

03:53:04.270 --> 03:53:05.871
HOMES AND BUSINESSES FOR RESALE,

03:53:05.938 --> 03:53:07.807
WITH A RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL TO

03:53:07.873 --> 03:53:10.009
BRING THEM BACK TO THEIR

03:53:10.076 --> 03:53:10.676
COMMUNITY. THAT'S SOMETHING THEY

03:53:10.743 --> 03:53:12.345
COULD DO. THE AUTHORITY COULD

03:53:12.411 --> 03:53:12.978
ALSO USE THE LAND FOR COMMUNITY

03:53:13.045 --> 03:53:14.080
INFRASTRUCTURE, LIKE GREEN SPACE

03:53:14.146 --> 03:53:15.214
AND FIREBREAKS, TO PREVENT THE

03:53:15.281 --> 03:53:16.349
TRAGEDY OF AN URBAN WILDFIRE

03:53:16.415 --> 03:53:17.850
FROM OCCURRING AGAIN. LET ME BE

03:53:17.917 --> 03:53:19.018
REAL CLEAR. THERE'S NOTHING IN

03:53:19.085 --> 03:53:20.953
THE BILL THAT GETS IN THE WAY OF

03:53:21.020 --> 03:53:23.589
PERMITTING OR NO IMPACT ON

03:53:23.656 --> 03:53:24.824
REZONING. THIS IS ALL ABOUT THE

03:53:24.890 --> 03:53:26.826
PHYSICAL ACT OF REBUILDING. THE

03:53:26.892 --> 03:53:28.627
BILL PROVIDES AN IMPORTANT KIND

03:53:28.694 --> 03:53:30.429
OF POTENTIAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE

03:53:30.496 --> 03:53:31.464
CREATION OF RESILIENT REBUILDING

03:53:31.530 --> 03:53:32.732
AUTHORITY, WHILE LEAVING

03:53:32.798 --> 03:53:33.432
COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL

03:53:33.499 --> 03:53:35.434
GOVERNMENTS IN CONTROL. I WILL

03:53:35.501 --> 03:53:37.303
SAY, BECAUSE OF THE VERY QUICK

03:53:37.370 --> 03:53:38.604
NATURE OF TURNAROUND ASSOCIATED

03:53:38.671 --> 03:53:40.306
WITH THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION

03:53:40.373 --> 03:53:41.207
REPORT COMING OUT AND THE

03:53:41.273 --> 03:53:43.776
INTRODUCTION OF THE BILL, QUITE

03:53:43.843 --> 03:53:44.944
FRANKLY, THERE IS A LOT OF

03:53:45.010 --> 03:53:46.679
ARGUMENT TO BE MADE FOR THIS

03:53:46.746 --> 03:53:48.781
PORTION OF THE BILL TO BE MADE A

03:53:48.848 --> 03:53:50.483
TWO YEAR BILL. I JUST WANTED THE

03:53:50.549 --> 03:53:51.784
OPPORTUNITY TO SEE IF WE COULD

03:53:51.851 --> 03:53:54.220
COME TO CONSENSUS ON THIS THIS

03:53:54.286 --> 03:53:56.822
YEAR, IF BECAUSE THERE WAS A LOT

03:53:56.889 --> 03:53:58.090
OF PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT THAT WHAT

03:53:58.157 --> 03:53:59.825
WAS IN THE BLUE RIBBON

03:53:59.892 --> 03:54:01.260
COMMISSION MADE A LOT OF SENSE

03:54:01.327 --> 03:54:02.461
AND COULD BE REALLY BENEFICIAL

03:54:02.528 --> 03:54:03.863
TO THE REBUILD, BUT IT'S VERY

03:54:03.929 --> 03:54:05.398
POSSIBLE WE WON'T SIMPLY BE ABLE

03:54:05.464 --> 03:54:08.901
TO GET TO A GOOD ENOUGH KIND OF

03:54:08.968 --> 03:54:11.170
CHORD BY THE TIME WE COME BACK

03:54:11.237 --> 03:54:12.571
FROM BREAK. I JUST WANT TO KIND

03:54:12.638 --> 03:54:14.440
OF PUT THAT OUT THERE AND SAY

03:54:14.507 --> 03:54:16.041
THAT A LOT OF THINGS, PROBABLY

03:54:16.108 --> 03:54:17.076
THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THING THAT

03:54:17.143 --> 03:54:18.744
WE HAVE TO CHANGE FROM THE

03:54:18.811 --> 03:54:20.012
CURRENT WRITING IS THE

03:54:20.079 --> 03:54:21.213
GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AND REALLY

03:54:21.280 --> 03:54:22.348
CENTER THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE

03:54:22.415 --> 03:54:24.417
IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY, YOU

03:54:24.483 --> 03:54:25.951
KNOW, AND I WILL SAY RIGHT NOW,

03:54:26.018 --> 03:54:27.787
I'M NOT MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS

03:54:27.853 --> 03:54:30.222

RESILIENT REBUILDING AUTHORITY

03:54:44.270 --> 03:54:44.737
AND THE LOCAL CONTEXT OF

03:54:44.804 --> 03:54:45.738

RECOVERY, CENTERING ON THREE

03:57:07.346 --> 03:57:08.981
TOPICS. FIRST, THE ROLE OF

03:57:09.048 --> 03:57:10.783

2011, REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES AND

03:57:17.323 --> 03:57:18.023
REDEVELOPMENT POWERS WERE USED

03:57:18.090 --> 03:57:20.893
BY MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN

03:57:20.960 --> 03:57:22.328

ENABLED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO

FOCUS ON LONG TERM RECOVERY.

03:57:56.929 --> 03:57:58.697
WHEN YOU HAVE THESE LARGE

03:57:58.764 --> 03:58:00.833

03:58:26.925 --> 03:58:28.460
OF HAVING AN ORGANIZATION

FOCUSED ON LA REGIONS RECOVERY

03:58:30.796 --> 03:58:32.498

03:58:54.153 --> 03:58:55.921
VERY EFFECTIVE TO DATE, IT WILL

03:58:55.988 --> 03:58:58.090
BE A CHALLENGE TO SUSTAIN THIS

03:58:58.157 --> 03:58:59.825
KIND OF MODEL, ESPECIALLY AS

03:58:59.892 --> 03:59:01.927
FEMA WINDS DOWN ITS JOINT FIELD

03:59:01.994 --> 03:59:04.196

INEVITABLY ARISE AND COMPETE FOR

ATTENTION. IN CLOSING, THIS

03:59:09.968 --> 03:59:11.804
LEGISLATION GIVES THE STATE, THE

03:59:11.870 --> 03:59:13.539
COUNTY, AND THE IMPACTED CITIES

03:59:13.605 --> 03:59:16.075
IMPORTANT OPTIONS AND OPTIONS

DISTRIBUTE AN ARRAY OF PUBLIC

ALMOST HALF A BILLION OF

03:59:23.015 --> 03:59:23.716
PHILANTHROPIC FUNDS WAITING TO

03:59:23.782 --> 03:59:25.551
BE INVESTED IN THIS AREA. THIS

03:59:25.617 --> 03:59:28.654
GIVES A CENTRAL PLACE FOR THAT

03:59:28.721 --> 03:59:30.456
TO GO OPTIONS FOR SHARED,

03:59:30.522 --> 03:59:31.924

04:00:10.062 --> 04:00:11.764
SOMEONE, OH, SOMEONE COMING IN

04:00:11.830 --> 04:00:14.233

THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. MEMBERS.

04:00:19.204 --> 04:00:21.206
ANDREW ANTHONY, ON BEHALF OF LOS

04:00:21.273 --> 04:00:23.776
ANGELES MAYOR KAREN BASS, WE'VE

04:00:23.842 --> 04:00:24.943
BEEN IN COMMUNICATION WITH THE

04:00:25.010 --> 04:00:26.478
MAYOR'S OFFICE. WE APPRECIATE

04:00:26.545 --> 04:00:28.514
THE WAY THE AUTHOR DESCRIBED THE

04:00:28.580 --> 04:00:29.982
BILL, THE TWO DIFFERENT PARTS,

04:00:30.048 --> 04:00:33.018
AND HOW THE SECOND PART OF THE

04:00:33.085 --> 04:00:35.587
BILL EVOLVED. WE DO HAVE

04:00:35.654 --> 04:00:36.755
CONCERNS ABOUT KIND OF THE

04:00:36.822 --> 04:00:38.757
FAIRLY SUDDEN NATURE OF THE

04:00:38.824 --> 04:00:41.059
SECOND PART OF THE BILL, THE

04:00:41.126 --> 04:00:42.694
REVITALIZATION PROVISIONS. WE

04:00:42.761 --> 04:00:43.862
THINK THAT MORE TIME SHOULD BE

04:00:43.929 --> 04:00:46.098
ALLOWED, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE SET

04:00:46.165 --> 04:00:47.933
THE FORMATION OF ENTITIES LIKE

04:00:48.000 --> 04:00:49.601
THIS. YOU WANT BUY IN FROM AS

04:00:49.668 --> 04:00:51.436
MANY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AS

04:00:51.503 --> 04:00:53.939
POSSIBLE. THE AUTHOR DID MENTION

04:00:54.006 --> 04:00:55.774
QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE

04:00:55.841 --> 04:00:58.310
CITY COUNCIL WHOSE DISTRICTS

04:00:58.377 --> 04:01:00.846
ENCOMPASSED THE PALISADES. WE

04:01:00.913 --> 04:01:02.114
AGREE THAT MORE TIME SHOULD BE

04:01:02.181 --> 04:01:03.782
ALLOWED TO KIND OF MAKE SURE

04:01:03.849 --> 04:01:05.617
THERE'S A LOCAL CONSENSUS BEFORE

04:01:05.684 --> 04:01:06.618
AN ACTION LIKE THIS IS TAKEN

04:01:06.685 --> 04:01:08.086
HERE AT THE STATE LEVEL. AND FOR

04:01:08.153 --> 04:01:10.556
THOSE REASONS, WE REGISTER OUR

04:01:10.622 --> 04:01:12.758
OPPOSITION RESPECTFULLY. YEAH.

04:01:12.825 --> 04:01:15.327
THANK YOU. GIVEN THAT WE DID NOT

04:01:15.394 --> 04:01:16.628
HEAR THIS BEFORE, ANY QUESTIONS

04:01:16.695 --> 04:01:19.965
OR COMMENTS? ASSEMBLY MEMBER

04:01:20.032 --> 04:01:22.868
PACHECO. THANK YOU. SENATOR. MY

04:01:22.935 --> 04:01:24.603
QUESTION IS HOW ARE THE

04:01:24.670 --> 04:01:25.537
CONVERSATIONS GOING WITH THE

04:01:25.604 --> 04:01:27.139
CITY COUNCIL MEMBER THAT

04:01:27.206 --> 04:01:28.907
REPRESENTS THE PACIFIC PALISADES

04:01:28.974 --> 04:01:34.112
AREA? YEAH. SO, WELL, WE'VE

04:01:34.179 --> 04:01:34.980
ACTUALLY BEEN TEXTING TODAY

04:01:35.047 --> 04:01:36.782
ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THAT WE

04:01:36.849 --> 04:01:38.050
HAVE TO DO. WE'RE GOING TO BE

04:01:38.116 --> 04:01:40.085
GOING TO THE PACIFIC PALISADES

04:01:40.152 --> 04:01:40.652
COMMUNITY COUNCIL TOMORROW.

04:01:40.719 --> 04:01:42.421
WE'RE DOING A TOWN HALL TOGETHER

04:01:42.487 --> 04:01:43.288
NEXT WEEK. SHE INITIALLY WAS

04:01:43.355 --> 04:01:45.023
VERY NERVOUS ABOUT THE WAY THAT

04:01:45.090 --> 04:01:48.026
THE BILL WAS FRAMED. YOU KNOW,

04:01:48.093 --> 04:01:49.862
I'VE MADE YOU KNOW, I'VE ASSURED

04:01:49.928 --> 04:01:51.930
HER THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO RAM

04:01:51.997 --> 04:01:53.732
THIS DOWN OUR THROAT, THAT WE'RE

04:01:53.799 --> 04:01:54.967
GOING TO CHANGE THE GOVERNANCE

04:01:55.033 --> 04:01:56.668
STRUCTURE THAT'S IN THE BILL. I

04:01:56.735 --> 04:01:58.070
THINK SHE RECOGNIZES THAT

04:01:58.136 --> 04:01:59.872
THERE'S A THERE'S SOME

04:01:59.938 --> 04:02:01.240
SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL BENEFITS

04:02:01.306 --> 04:02:02.040
ASSOCIATED WITH DOING SOMETHING

04:02:02.107 --> 04:02:04.176
LIKE THIS. BUT I THINK ALL OF US

04:02:04.243 --> 04:02:05.644
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT MAKING SURE

04:02:05.711 --> 04:02:06.979
THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

04:02:07.045 --> 04:02:08.814
TRULY ENGAGES THE COMMUNITY.

04:02:08.881 --> 04:02:11.316
AND, YOU KNOW, THERE'S SO MANY

04:02:11.383 --> 04:02:13.952
RUMORS FLOATING AROUND, PARTLY

04:02:14.019 --> 04:02:16.822
BECAUSE OF IT'S GETTING

04:02:16.889 --> 04:02:17.890
CONFLATED WITH, FIRST OF ALL,

04:02:17.956 --> 04:02:20.058
THE TWO PORTIONS OF THE BILL ARE

04:02:20.125 --> 04:02:21.660
GETTING CONFLATED. IT'S GETTING

04:02:21.727 --> 04:02:22.261
CONFLATED WITH THE GOVERNOR'S

04:02:22.327 --> 04:02:24.696
RECENT 100 MILLION, $1 MILLION

04:02:24.763 --> 04:02:26.431
AFFORDABLE HOUSING ANNOUNCEMENT,

04:02:26.498 --> 04:02:27.599
WHICH HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

04:02:27.666 --> 04:02:29.034
THIS BILL. BUT UNFORTUNATELY,

04:02:29.101 --> 04:02:29.868
THEY HAPPEN RIGHT AROUND THE

04:02:29.935 --> 04:02:32.638
SAME TIME. SO PEOPLE WERE WERE

04:02:32.704 --> 04:02:34.473
GETTING THOSE TWO CONFUSED. SO

04:02:34.539 --> 04:02:35.908
SHE'S SHE'S CERTAINLY I MEAN,

04:02:35.974 --> 04:02:37.910
I'VE SAID TO HER, YOU KNOW, IF

04:02:37.976 --> 04:02:39.912
YOU WANT ME TO PULL THE BILL,

04:02:39.978 --> 04:02:41.680
I'LL PULL THE BILL. BUT BUT YOU

04:02:41.747 --> 04:02:43.048
KNOW, WE IN OUR CONVERSATIONS I

04:02:43.115 --> 04:02:44.950
THINK WE'VE COME WE, WE'VE, WE

04:02:45.017 --> 04:02:46.151
AGREE THAT THERE'S SOME

04:02:46.218 --> 04:02:48.587
POTENTIAL BENEFIT HERE AGAIN. DO

04:02:48.654 --> 04:02:50.088
I THINK THAT IT'S LIKELY THAT

04:02:50.155 --> 04:02:52.791
THIS IS GOING TO GET TO THE

04:02:52.858 --> 04:02:53.725
GOVERNOR'S DESK IN TIED UP IN A

04:02:53.792 --> 04:02:54.960
BOW BY SEPTEMBER? I HONESTLY, I

04:02:55.027 --> 04:02:56.695
DON'T, BUT I THINK THERE'S A

04:02:56.762 --> 04:02:58.797
CHANCE IF THERE'S SOME BENEFIT

04:02:58.864 --> 04:03:00.999
HERE AND PERHAPS WORKING

04:03:01.066 --> 04:03:03.669
TOGETHER, WE CAN COME WE CAN

04:03:03.735 --> 04:03:05.637
COME UP WITH SOME SOLUTIONS THAT

04:03:05.704 --> 04:03:06.805
WILL BE REALLY BENEFICIAL FOR

04:03:06.872 --> 04:03:09.274
THE REBUILD RIGHT NOW. THAT'S

04:03:09.341 --> 04:03:11.176
GOING TO REALLY DEPEND ON HOW

04:03:11.243 --> 04:03:12.010
THE CONVERSATIONS GO OVER THE

04:03:12.077 --> 04:03:13.912
COURSE OF THE SUMMER BETWEEN THE

04:03:13.979 --> 04:03:15.647
COMMISSION, THE SUPERVISOR'S

04:03:15.714 --> 04:03:18.417
OFFICE, MY OFFICE MEMBER ERWIN,

04:03:18.483 --> 04:03:20.152
AND THEN THE MAYOR AND THE

04:03:20.218 --> 04:03:21.253
COUNCIL MEMBER WITH THE WITH THE

04:03:21.320 --> 04:03:22.654
COMMUNITY COUNCIL, WITH THE CITY

04:03:22.721 --> 04:03:24.056
OF MALIBU, WITH THE FOLKS IN

04:03:24.122 --> 04:03:25.757
ALTADENA, YOU KNOW, TO WHAT

04:03:25.824 --> 04:03:27.392
EXTENT ARE WE GOING TO HAVE TWO

04:03:27.459 --> 04:03:28.327
DIFFERENT YOU KNOW, WE'RE WE'RE

04:03:28.393 --> 04:03:30.062
PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE TWO

04:03:30.128 --> 04:03:32.764
DIFFERENT AUTHORITIES FOR THOSE

04:03:32.831 --> 04:03:33.999
TWO PLACES. SO THERE'S A LOT OF

04:03:34.066 --> 04:03:36.635
FACTORS THAT HAVE TO COME INTO

04:03:36.702 --> 04:03:37.803
PLAY. AND THERE'S A LOT OF

04:03:37.869 --> 04:03:39.004
PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY WHO HAVE

04:03:39.071 --> 04:03:41.073
TO HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD AND

04:03:41.139 --> 04:03:41.707
WHO, QUITE FRANKLY, ARE NERVOUS

04:03:41.773 --> 04:03:43.141
RIGHT NOW ABOUT ANYTHING

04:03:43.208 --> 04:03:43.709
ASSOCIATED WITH GOVERNMENT

04:03:43.775 --> 04:03:46.745
INVOLVEMENT IN THE REBUILD. SO I

04:03:46.812 --> 04:03:47.913
DON'T KNOW WHERE THIS GOES.

04:03:47.980 --> 04:03:49.715
QUITE FRANKLY, I DON'T YOU KNOW,

04:03:49.781 --> 04:03:52.150
THE ONLY REASON WHY WE'RE EVEN

04:03:52.217 --> 04:03:54.753
AT THIS KIND OF TIME FRAME IS

04:03:54.820 --> 04:03:56.288
JUST BECAUSE THE FIRE OBVIOUSLY

04:03:56.355 --> 04:03:58.757
HAPPENED IN THIS CALENDAR YEAR.

04:03:58.824 --> 04:03:59.858
THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION ONLY

04:03:59.925 --> 04:04:01.960
JUST CAME OUT WITH ITS

04:04:02.027 --> 04:04:02.627
RECOMMENDATIONS AFTER A LONG AND

04:04:02.694 --> 04:04:05.497
VERY STUDIED REPORT THAT REALLY

04:04:05.564 --> 04:04:06.898
LOOKED AT A LOT OF DIFFERENT

04:04:06.965 --> 04:04:07.833
EXAMPLES, AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE

04:04:07.899 --> 04:04:09.901
IF WE CAN PULL SOMETHING

04:04:09.968 --> 04:04:10.535
MEANINGFUL TOGETHER THAT'S GOING

04:04:10.602 --> 04:04:11.636
TO TRULY BUILD COMMUNITY

04:04:11.703 --> 04:04:13.772
CONSENSUS GIVEN OUR TIGHT

04:04:13.839 --> 04:04:16.074
LEGISLATIVE TIMEFRAMES. I DON'T

04:04:16.141 --> 04:04:18.343
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THIS GOES,

04:04:18.410 --> 04:04:20.379
BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH GIVING IT

04:04:20.445 --> 04:04:24.916
A TRY. BUT I'M CERTAINLY. I'M

04:04:24.983 --> 04:04:26.351
ALSO COMFORTABLE IF THE

04:04:26.418 --> 04:04:28.620
COMMITTEE PREFERS TO, TO MAKE IT

04:04:28.687 --> 04:04:30.655
A TWO YEAR BILL, BUT I THINK

04:04:30.722 --> 04:04:32.958
IT'S WORTH TRYING TO SEE IF WE

04:04:33.025 --> 04:04:34.426
CAN GET SOMETHING TOGETHER OVER

04:04:34.493 --> 04:04:36.495
THE COURSE OF THE SUMMER. BUT I

04:04:36.561 --> 04:04:37.229
REALLY DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE

04:04:37.295 --> 04:04:39.097
WILL OR NOT. THANK YOU. SENATOR.

04:04:39.164 --> 04:04:40.265
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THANK YOU. I

04:04:40.332 --> 04:04:42.000
JUST WANTED TO JUST SAY I HOPE

04:04:42.067 --> 04:04:43.802
THE CONVERSATIONS CONTINUE AND

04:04:43.869 --> 04:04:45.570
LOOKING FORWARD TO SEE THE WHAT

04:04:45.637 --> 04:04:47.773
COMES OUT OF IT. SO THANK YOU.

04:04:47.839 --> 04:04:50.475
YEAH. SENATOR STEPHANIE, THANK

04:04:50.542 --> 04:04:53.178
YOU. CHAIR, I FEEL COMPELLED TO

04:04:53.245 --> 04:04:54.913
SPEAK UP BECAUSE THERE WAS A

04:04:54.980 --> 04:04:57.249
WOMAN HERE EARLIER. HER NAME'S

04:04:57.315 --> 04:04:59.017
SHAUNA DAWSON, WHO I ACTUALLY

04:04:59.084 --> 04:05:01.586
MET WITH WHEN I WENT DOWN TO LOS

04:05:01.653 --> 04:05:04.856
ANGELES IN APRIL TO LOOK AT THE

04:05:04.923 --> 04:05:06.358
FIRES. LOOK AT I WENT AND TOURED

04:05:06.425 --> 04:05:07.893
ALTADENA AND I SPENT TWO HOURS

04:05:07.959 --> 04:05:09.995
IN HER HOME JUST HEARING OF WHAT

04:05:10.062 --> 04:05:11.463
HAPPENED TO HER. IT WAS SO

04:05:11.530 --> 04:05:13.465
TRAGIC. AND, YOU KNOW, LISTENING

04:05:13.532 --> 04:05:16.001
TO, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF THE

04:05:16.068 --> 04:05:17.469
COMPLAINTS IN THE AFTERMATH OF

04:05:17.536 --> 04:05:18.970
WHAT PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH IN

04:05:19.037 --> 04:05:20.772
AN EFFORT TO REBUILD AND PUT

04:05:20.839 --> 04:05:22.307
THEIR LIVES BACK TOGETHER. AND

04:05:22.374 --> 04:05:23.475
SHE WAS HERE EARLIER TODAY. I

04:05:23.542 --> 04:05:24.943
KNOW SHE HAD TO GET ON A FLIGHT

04:05:25.010 --> 04:05:26.878
BACK. AND I THOUGHT SOMEBODY WAS

04:05:26.945 --> 04:05:28.180
GOING TO READ HER DEPOSITION

04:05:28.246 --> 04:05:29.748
TESTIMONY, BUT I FEEL LIKE I

04:05:29.815 --> 04:05:31.983
JUST NEED TO AT LEAST RAISE THE

04:05:32.050 --> 04:05:33.819
FACT THAT THEY WERE HERE AND

04:05:33.885 --> 04:05:34.486
THEY DID HAVE CONCERNS. AND WITH

04:05:34.553 --> 04:05:38.156
THE OPPOSITION STATING THAT THEY

04:05:38.223 --> 04:05:40.559
FEEL THAT THIS REMOVES COMMUNITY

04:05:40.625 --> 04:05:41.893
INPUT IS SOMETHING THAT RAISES

04:05:41.960 --> 04:05:43.829
ALARMS FOR ME. I'M BIG ABOUT

04:05:43.895 --> 04:05:45.397
DOING THINGS WITH THE COMMUNITY,

04:05:45.464 --> 04:05:46.565
NOT TO THE COMMUNITY. AND WHEN

04:05:46.631 --> 04:05:49.267
YOU HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

04:05:49.334 --> 04:05:50.168
REALLY STRUGGLING AND STILL

04:05:50.235 --> 04:05:51.803
DEALING WITH THE AFTERMATH AND

04:05:51.870 --> 04:05:53.638
THE TRAUMA THAT COMES WITH

04:05:53.705 --> 04:05:55.040
LOSING EVERYTHING YOU HAVE AND

04:05:55.107 --> 04:05:56.341
THEN FEELING SOMEHOW THAT

04:05:56.408 --> 04:05:57.476
GOVERNMENT IS SHUTTING THEM OUT

04:05:57.542 --> 04:05:59.311
IN THE PROCESS OF REBUILDING. I

04:05:59.377 --> 04:06:01.346
THINK THAT'S A REALLY HARD PILL

04:06:01.413 --> 04:06:03.215
TO SWALLOW. AND FOR ME, NOT

04:06:03.281 --> 04:06:06.118
KNOWING MUCH MORE. I MEAN, BEING

04:06:06.184 --> 04:06:07.853
FROM SAN FRANCISCO, I'M LUCKY

04:06:07.919 --> 04:06:09.688
I'M A CITY AND COUNTY, SO I

04:06:09.754 --> 04:06:12.090
DIDN'T, YOU KNOW, WE DIDN'T HAVE

04:06:12.157 --> 04:06:12.724
CITIES OPPOSING EVERYTHING. YOU

04:06:12.791 --> 04:06:14.059
KNOW, WE WERE, YOU KNOW, WHEN

04:06:14.126 --> 04:06:16.328
YOU HAVE THE MAYOR OF LA AND

04:06:16.394 --> 04:06:18.663
THEN YOU HAVE A SUPERVISOR

04:06:18.730 --> 04:06:20.332
SAYING DIFFERENT THINGS, IT'S

04:06:20.398 --> 04:06:24.603
HARD FOR ME TO HAVE A LOT OF

04:06:24.669 --> 04:06:28.373
FAITH OR A LOT OF CONFIDENCE IN

04:06:28.440 --> 04:06:29.908
VOTING ON SOMETHING THAT I FEEL

04:06:29.975 --> 04:06:32.010
LIKE I NEED MORE INFORMATION

04:06:32.077 --> 04:06:33.378
ABOUT, TO FEEL SETTLED IN THE

04:06:33.445 --> 04:06:35.313
FACT THAT I'M DOING RIGHT BY A

04:06:35.380 --> 04:06:38.083
LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT AREN'T

04:06:38.150 --> 04:06:40.552
TRUSTING THIS PROCESS. SO IT

04:06:40.619 --> 04:06:41.653
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE WILLING,

04:06:41.720 --> 04:06:43.255
WHICH I LOVE TO HEAR, TO

04:06:43.321 --> 04:06:46.391
CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT SO THAT

04:06:46.458 --> 04:06:47.425
PEOPLE DO FEEL OKAY IN THIS

04:06:47.492 --> 04:06:49.294
PROCESS. AND YOU MENTIONED IT TO

04:06:49.361 --> 04:06:51.029
YOUR BILL. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

04:06:51.096 --> 04:06:53.198
CHAIR WANTS TO DO WITH THAT, BUT

04:06:53.265 --> 04:06:54.599
I WOULD BE WILLING TO VOTE FOR

04:06:54.666 --> 04:06:55.767
IT KNOWING THAT I MIGHT NOT BE

04:06:55.834 --> 04:06:58.537
ABLE TO VOTE FOR IT ON THE

04:06:58.603 --> 04:06:59.437
FLOOR. IF THESE CONCERNS AREN'T

04:06:59.504 --> 04:07:00.805
AREN'T MET. SO THANK YOU. THAT'S

04:07:00.872 --> 04:07:03.275
A VERY REASONABLE POSITION. I

04:07:03.341 --> 04:07:04.276
KIND OF SHARE THAT POSITION,

04:07:04.342 --> 04:07:08.246
QUITE FRANKLY. YOU KNOW, I I'VE

04:07:08.313 --> 04:07:09.814
SAID THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN,

04:07:09.881 --> 04:07:11.883
I'M NOT LOOKING TO JAM THIS DOWN

04:07:11.950 --> 04:07:12.684
PEOPLE'S THROATS. YOU KNOW, THE

04:07:12.751 --> 04:07:13.985
CHALLENGE, OF COURSE, IS WHEN WE

04:07:14.052 --> 04:07:15.887
SAY, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO GET

04:07:15.954 --> 04:07:17.722
THE COMMUNITY TO SUPPORT. WHAT

04:07:17.789 --> 04:07:18.690
IS THAT? THERE WILL ALWAYS BE

04:07:18.757 --> 04:07:20.959
SOMEBODY WHO WON'T BE FULLY

04:07:21.026 --> 04:07:21.593
COMFORTABLE. THE FLIP SIDE IS

04:07:21.660 --> 04:07:22.694
THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT READY TO

04:07:22.761 --> 04:07:26.364
PASS INTO LAW RIGHT NOW. SO, YOU

04:07:26.431 --> 04:07:28.833
KNOW, AND BY THE WAY, ON THE

04:07:28.900 --> 04:07:29.434
COMMUNITY INPUT QUESTION, IT

04:07:29.501 --> 04:07:30.368
DOESN'T CUT OUT COMMUNITY INPUT.

04:07:30.435 --> 04:07:32.037
IT JUST DOESN'T IT DOESN'T

04:07:32.103 --> 04:07:34.139
SPECIFY ONE PATH OR ANOTHER. SO

04:07:34.206 --> 04:07:35.807
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BUILD

04:07:35.874 --> 04:07:37.609
SIGNIFICANT COMMUNITY INPUT INTO

04:07:37.676 --> 04:07:40.011
THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE IN

04:07:40.078 --> 04:07:43.248
ORDER FOR THIS TO PASS THE SMELL

04:07:43.315 --> 04:07:46.484
TEST WITH THE LOCALS. ANYBODY

04:07:46.551 --> 04:07:49.054
ELSE? ANYBODY ELSE? ASSEMBLYMAN

04:07:49.120 --> 04:07:51.122
RANSOM YEAH, I WANTED TO ALSO,

04:07:51.189 --> 04:07:53.758
IF ASSEMBLYMEMBER, IF I MIGHT

04:07:53.825 --> 04:07:55.260
JUST ADD BRIEFLY TO WHAT THE

04:07:55.327 --> 04:07:56.695
SENATOR SAID, YOU KNOW, FROM

04:07:56.761 --> 04:07:57.929
FROM THE SUPERVISOR'S

04:07:57.996 --> 04:08:00.899
PERSPECTIVE, THERE'S URGENCY IN

04:08:00.966 --> 04:08:02.367
THIS IN TERMS OF HAVING A

04:08:02.434 --> 04:08:05.604
FRAMEWORK FOR, FOR RECOVERY THAT

04:08:05.670 --> 04:08:07.872
MEETS THE MOMENT OF EXACTLY OF

04:08:07.939 --> 04:08:10.542
THE CONSTITUENT THAT OR THE

04:08:10.609 --> 04:08:11.109
INDIVIDUAL THAT YOU TALKED

04:08:11.176 --> 04:08:12.978
ABOUT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHO IS

04:08:13.044 --> 04:08:15.513
LIKE THOUSANDS OF OTHERS IN L.A.

04:08:15.580 --> 04:08:17.282
COUNTY TRYING TO NAVIGATE WHAT

04:08:17.349 --> 04:08:20.585
COMES NEXT IN A PROCESS THAT NO

04:08:20.652 --> 04:08:22.787
FAMILY HAS REALLY BEEN THROUGH

04:08:22.854 --> 04:08:25.624
IN THESE TWO COMMUNITIES.

04:08:25.690 --> 04:08:28.093
THERE'S ALREADY BEEN A COUPLE

04:08:28.159 --> 04:08:29.961
GOOD COMMUNITY CONVERSATIONS.

04:08:30.028 --> 04:08:31.296
THERE WILL BE MANY MORE THAT

04:08:31.363 --> 04:08:33.531
WILL BE BUILT INTO THIS PROCESS.

04:08:33.598 --> 04:08:34.432
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING

04:08:34.499 --> 04:08:36.735
IN THIS BILL THAT STOPS US FROM

04:08:36.801 --> 04:08:38.903
HAVING A LOT MORE COMMUNITY

04:08:38.970 --> 04:08:41.406
ENGAGEMENT AND CONVERSATION. I

04:08:41.473 --> 04:08:43.241
KNOW THAT LA COUNTY, FOR ON ITS

04:08:43.308 --> 04:08:45.076
OWN PART, IF THIS DOES NOT COME

04:08:45.143 --> 04:08:46.811
THROUGH FOR ITS UNINCORPORATED

04:08:46.878 --> 04:08:48.046
AREAS, WHICH IS ONLY ABOUT HALF

04:08:48.113 --> 04:08:50.749
OF THE IMPACTED COMMUNITIES IS

04:08:50.815 --> 04:08:53.618
ALREADY THINKING ABOUT A NEW,

04:08:53.685 --> 04:08:55.887
STREAMLINED, EFFICIENT WAY TO

04:08:55.954 --> 04:08:58.023
MANAGE THE RECOVERY, RESEMBLING

04:08:58.089 --> 04:09:00.158
THIS AUTHORITY, MORE OR LESS

04:09:00.225 --> 04:09:01.626
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT BUSINESS AS

04:09:01.693 --> 04:09:03.495
USUAL AND WILL NOT GET, YOU

04:09:03.561 --> 04:09:05.163
KNOW, THAT MANY PEOPLE HOME

04:09:05.230 --> 04:09:07.299
FAST. SO WE HOPE THAT THIS COULD

04:09:07.365 --> 04:09:09.301
BE A REGIONAL APPROACH. THANK

04:09:09.367 --> 04:09:10.935
YOU. SENATOR. FIRST OF ALL, I

04:09:11.002 --> 04:09:12.837
WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR

04:09:12.904 --> 04:09:14.539
TESTIMONY. I FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE

04:09:14.606 --> 04:09:15.707
GIVEN THE MOST HONEST TESTIMONY

04:09:15.774 --> 04:09:18.943
I'VE HEARD SINCE I'VE BEEN IN

04:09:19.010 --> 04:09:20.378
THE LEGISLATURE IN REGARDS TO

04:09:20.445 --> 04:09:22.113
KIND OF THE COMPLEXITIES OF YOUR

04:09:22.180 --> 04:09:25.784
BILL AND THE NEED TO CONTINUE TO

04:09:25.850 --> 04:09:27.619
ENGAGE AND BUILD SUPPORT AND

04:09:27.686 --> 04:09:29.754
KIND OF WORK OUT THE SECOND PART

04:09:29.821 --> 04:09:31.690
OF YOUR BILL. SO I DO APPRECIATE

04:09:31.756 --> 04:09:32.957
IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT YOU ARE

04:09:33.024 --> 04:09:35.093
WILLING TO SPEND MORE TIME

04:09:35.160 --> 04:09:37.662
WORKING ON IT. AND I GUESS MY

04:09:37.729 --> 04:09:39.764
QUESTION IS, SINCE YOU'VE KIND

04:09:39.831 --> 04:09:41.533
OF STATED THAT AND WE HAVE THE

04:09:41.599 --> 04:09:42.400
MAYOR'S THE, YOU KNOW, THE

04:09:42.467 --> 04:09:43.635
CITIES AND COUNTIES, YOU KNOW,

04:09:43.702 --> 04:09:45.270
NOT IN FULL AGREEMENT. WE NEED

04:09:45.337 --> 04:09:49.140
TO WORK OUT THE STRUCTURE WITH

04:09:49.207 --> 04:09:51.009
WHAT'S THE HARM IN WAITING TWO

04:09:51.076 --> 04:09:53.645
YEARS? ARE YOU ABLE TO BECAUSE

04:09:53.712 --> 04:09:55.046
WHEN WE SAY TWO YEARS, WE KNOW

04:09:55.113 --> 04:09:55.980
THAT'S HERE IN THIS WORLD,

04:09:56.047 --> 04:09:57.882
THAT'S NOT TWO FULL YEARS. IT'S

04:09:57.949 --> 04:09:59.918
JUST A FEW MONTHS DOWN THE ROAD.

04:09:59.984 --> 04:10:01.886
IS THERE ANY HARM IN JUST MAKING

04:10:01.953 --> 04:10:03.655
SURE YOU GET THIS RIGHT AND HAVE

04:10:03.722 --> 04:10:06.091
GO BACK, GOING BACK TO ENGAGE

04:10:06.157 --> 04:10:08.360
WITH YOUR COMMUNITY? I'D LOVE

04:10:08.426 --> 04:10:10.495
TO. I'D LOVE TO KICK THAT OVER

04:10:10.562 --> 04:10:12.263
TO LORI. I THINK THE HARM IS IF

04:10:12.330 --> 04:10:13.665
THERE'S IF THERE'S SUBSTANTIAL

04:10:13.732 --> 04:10:15.066
BENEFIT HERE, THE REBUILD IS

04:10:15.133 --> 04:10:16.868
HAPPENING IN REAL TIME. AND IF

04:10:16.935 --> 04:10:18.269
WE'RE NOT ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE

04:10:18.336 --> 04:10:19.671
OF ALL THE BENEFITS THAT THIS

04:10:19.738 --> 04:10:20.805
COULD POTENTIALLY PROVIDE IN

04:10:20.872 --> 04:10:22.607
TERMS OF ECONOMIES OF SCALE, IN

04:10:22.674 --> 04:10:24.008
TERMS OF PROCUREMENT OF BUILDING

04:10:24.075 --> 04:10:25.777
MATERIALS AT A LOWER COST, ALL

04:10:25.844 --> 04:10:27.979
THOSE KINDS OF BENEFITS, THEN WE

04:10:28.046 --> 04:10:29.881
THEN WE LOSE OUT, RIGHT? THINGS

04:10:29.948 --> 04:10:30.482
ARE MORE EXPENSIVE, THINGS ARE

04:10:30.548 --> 04:10:32.350
MORE HAPHAZARD, THINGS ARE LESS

04:10:32.417 --> 04:10:33.818
COHERENT. BUT I'D LOVE TO LOVE

04:10:33.885 --> 04:10:35.286
IF MISS JOHNSON MIGHT ANSWER,

04:10:35.353 --> 04:10:37.155
YEAH, I AS SOMEBODY WHO'S WORKED

04:10:37.222 --> 04:10:38.890
IN RECOVERY, I THINK WAITING TWO

04:10:38.957 --> 04:10:42.026
YEARS IS REALLY IS REALLY RISKY.

04:10:42.093 --> 04:10:44.129
AND THERE ARE HOUSES ALREADY

04:10:44.195 --> 04:10:46.364
BEING REBUILT, BUT THERE ARE

04:10:46.431 --> 04:10:47.799
ALSO A LOT OF INDEPENDENT

04:10:47.866 --> 04:10:49.200
ACTIVITIES GOING ON THAT COULD

04:10:49.267 --> 04:10:51.403
BE BETTER COORDINATED. AND AS I

04:10:51.469 --> 04:10:52.904
MENTIONED, PHILANTHROPIC MONEY

04:10:52.971 --> 04:10:54.739
HAS BEEN SO GENEROUS IN THIS

04:10:54.806 --> 04:10:56.007
EVENT, SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE

04:10:56.074 --> 04:10:58.510
NOT SEEN IN CALIFORNIA. AND THAT

04:10:58.576 --> 04:11:01.513
COMMUNITY IS LOOKING FOR A MORE

04:11:01.579 --> 04:11:03.415
COHESIVE STRUCTURE IN WHICH THEY

04:11:03.481 --> 04:11:06.551
CAN ENGAGE AND PLUG INTO. AND I

04:11:06.618 --> 04:11:08.119
WAS AT A MEETING A COUPLE OF

04:11:08.186 --> 04:11:09.754
WEEKS AGO IN WHICH THAT WAS ALL

04:11:09.821 --> 04:11:12.257
DISCUSSED. THIS INTERAGENCY

04:11:12.323 --> 04:11:14.392
RECOVERY COORDINATION IS NOT

04:11:14.459 --> 04:11:17.629
SOMETHING THAT HAS ANY COMMUNITY

04:11:17.695 --> 04:11:18.797
ENGAGEMENT OBLIGATIONS. IT'S

04:11:18.863 --> 04:11:20.331
JUST AGENCIES TALKING TO EACH

04:11:20.398 --> 04:11:21.966
OTHER AND TASK FORCES. THERE'S

04:11:22.033 --> 04:11:23.468
NOT REALLY, YOU KNOW, PUBLIC

04:11:23.535 --> 04:11:25.203
NOTICING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

04:11:25.270 --> 04:11:26.704
SO WHAT WE'VE SEEN TRADITIONALLY

04:11:26.771 --> 04:11:28.306
IS THAT WHEN YOU DO HAVE A

04:11:28.373 --> 04:11:30.175
RECOVERY AGENCY THAT IS

04:11:30.241 --> 04:11:32.043
ESTABLISHED, YOU KNOW, OR WITH

04:11:32.110 --> 04:11:33.578
REDEVELOPMENT POWERS, THERE WERE

04:11:33.645 --> 04:11:35.680
ALWAYS OBLIGATIONS FOR COMMUNITY

04:11:35.747 --> 04:11:37.148
ENGAGEMENT IN ORDER TO HAVE

04:11:37.215 --> 04:11:38.450
THOSE POWERS. AND I THINK THAT'S

04:11:38.516 --> 04:11:39.617
WHAT WE ENVISIONED AND PUT

04:11:39.684 --> 04:11:41.119
FORWARD SEVERAL MODELS IN THE

04:11:41.186 --> 04:11:43.221
BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION REPORT

04:11:43.288 --> 04:11:44.722
THAT WOULD HAVE ACTUALLY ENSURED

04:11:44.789 --> 04:11:46.858
THAT KIND OF COMMUNITY

04:11:46.925 --> 04:11:48.326
ACCOUNTABILITY, EITHER AS

04:11:48.393 --> 04:11:49.394
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE GOVERNING

04:11:49.461 --> 04:11:51.129
BODY OR ADVISORY COUNCILS COMING

04:11:51.196 --> 04:11:53.765
FROM EACH OF THE DIFFERENT FIRE

04:11:53.832 --> 04:11:56.534
AREAS, ETC. SO THESE WERE ALL

04:11:56.601 --> 04:11:57.969
THE KINDS OF ISSUES WE FELT WE

04:11:58.036 --> 04:12:00.238
NEEDED TO ADDRESS NOW AND GET ON

04:12:00.305 --> 04:12:01.940
THE TABLE AND DESIGN THIS WITH

04:12:02.006 --> 04:12:04.742
THE CITY AND THE COUNTY AND THE

04:12:04.809 --> 04:12:06.544
STATE. YEAH, I DO APPRECIATE

04:12:06.611 --> 04:12:08.413
THAT. I GUESS WHERE MY

04:12:08.480 --> 04:12:11.316
DISCONNECT IS, IS THAT THOSE ARE

04:12:11.382 --> 04:12:12.817
CONCEPTS THAT ARE IDEAS THAT ARE

04:12:12.884 --> 04:12:15.587
NOT INCLUDED YET, BECAUSE WE'RE

04:12:15.653 --> 04:12:18.490
STILL HAVING DIALOG. AND THEN

04:12:18.556 --> 04:12:19.624
THERE'S IT SEEMS LIKE ONE PART

04:12:19.691 --> 04:12:22.026
OF THE BILL IS VERY FLESHED OUT,

04:12:22.093 --> 04:12:22.927
AND THEN ONE PART OF THE BILL

04:12:22.994 --> 04:12:24.963
WE'RE STILL TRYING TO FLESH OUT.

04:12:25.029 --> 04:12:26.064
AND SO THAT'S THAT'S REALLY

04:12:26.130 --> 04:12:27.265
WHERE I'M STRUGGLING. AND WE

04:12:27.332 --> 04:12:29.000
WHEN WE SAY TWO YEARS HERE IN

04:12:29.067 --> 04:12:30.101
THIS WORLD, WE'RE NOT TALKING

04:12:30.168 --> 04:12:31.936
LIKE TWO FULL YEARS. SO JUST

04:12:32.003 --> 04:12:33.805
KIND OF FOR THE PUBLIC'S

04:12:33.872 --> 04:12:35.039
EDIFICATION. SO I JUST I WANTED

04:12:35.106 --> 04:12:37.041
TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO ADDRESS

04:12:37.108 --> 04:12:39.043
THAT, JUST BECAUSE YOU YOURSELF

04:12:39.110 --> 04:12:40.144
ALSO HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT

04:12:40.211 --> 04:12:42.380
THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS THAT YOU

04:12:42.447 --> 04:12:44.816
WOULD LIKE TO RECTIFY, BUT WE

04:12:44.883 --> 04:12:46.484
DON'T HAVE I DON'T KNOW WHAT

04:12:46.551 --> 04:12:47.151
THOSE AMENDMENTS LOOK LIKE. AND

04:12:47.218 --> 04:12:49.521
SO I'M KIND OF VOTING ON A, YOU

04:12:49.587 --> 04:12:51.756
KNOW, WE'LL SEE HOW IT GOES.

04:12:51.823 --> 04:12:53.758
YEAH. I MEAN, FIRST OF ALL, OF

04:12:53.825 --> 04:12:54.993
COURSE YOU'RE RIGHT. WE COULD IF

04:12:55.059 --> 04:12:56.327
WE TRULY BUILD CONSENSUS FOR THE

04:12:56.394 --> 04:12:57.495
COMING YEAR, WE COULD

04:12:57.562 --> 04:12:59.931
POTENTIALLY DO IT ON AN URGENCY

04:12:59.998 --> 04:13:00.798
SO THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO WAIT

04:13:00.865 --> 04:13:02.600
THE FULL YEAR NEXT YEAR. SO

04:13:02.667 --> 04:13:04.002
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. I THINK

04:13:04.068 --> 04:13:05.270
THE GENERAL CONTOURS OF WHAT

04:13:05.336 --> 04:13:07.772
THE, YOU KNOW, OF HOW THIS WOULD

04:13:07.839 --> 04:13:11.009
CHANGE THE BASIC THE BASIC

04:13:11.075 --> 04:13:12.544
POWERS OF THE AUTHORITY THAT ARE

04:13:12.610 --> 04:13:14.345
OUTLINED IN THE BILL WOULD WOULD

04:13:14.412 --> 04:13:16.114
BE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME. IT'S

04:13:16.180 --> 04:13:17.916
ULTIMATELY ABOUT TRYING TO

04:13:17.982 --> 04:13:22.587
BETTER MANAGE. KIND OF AND

04:13:22.654 --> 04:13:24.589
COLLECTIVELY MANAGE CERTAIN

04:13:24.656 --> 04:13:28.026
TYPES OF REBUILDING. YOU KNOW,

04:13:28.092 --> 04:13:28.760
OBVIOUSLY EVERYTHING'S STILL

04:13:28.826 --> 04:13:30.128
SUBJECT TO EVERYONE'S PROPERTY

04:13:30.194 --> 04:13:31.596
RIGHTS. IT DOESN'T IMPLICATE THE

04:13:31.663 --> 04:13:36.701
ZONING RULES, YOU KNOW, ETC. THE

04:13:36.768 --> 04:13:38.636
REAL THING. I THINK THAT THE

04:13:38.703 --> 04:13:39.971
BILL IS GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE

04:13:40.038 --> 04:13:41.839
SIGNIFICANTLY IS THE GOVERNANCE

04:13:41.906 --> 04:13:42.407
STRUCTURE. AND I THINK IT'S

04:13:42.473 --> 04:13:45.977
GOING TO BE VERY CENTERED ON

04:13:46.044 --> 04:13:48.780
LOCAL LOCAL CONTROL AND LOCAL

04:13:48.846 --> 04:13:52.183
INPUT. AND I WILL AGAIN

04:13:52.250 --> 04:13:54.018
REITERATE THAT, THAT AT LEAST

04:13:54.085 --> 04:13:55.620
WITH REGARDS TO THE PALISADES, I

04:13:55.687 --> 04:13:57.922
WOULD BE LOOKING FOR SIGN OFF

04:13:57.989 --> 04:13:58.990
FROM THE LOCAL COUNCIL MEMBER

04:13:59.057 --> 04:14:00.425
WHO REPRESENTS THE COMMUNITY

04:14:00.491 --> 04:14:02.694
THERE, WHO, YOU KNOW, HAS BEEN

04:14:02.760 --> 04:14:04.095
BOTH SKEPTICAL BUT ALSO OPEN TO

04:14:04.162 --> 04:14:06.531
THIS IDEA, I THINK HAS A LOT OF

04:14:06.598 --> 04:14:07.398
CREDIBILITY WITH THE RESIDENTS

04:14:07.465 --> 04:14:09.834
THERE. AND I'M NOT GOING TO

04:14:09.901 --> 04:14:12.570
PURSUE A BILL, YOU KNOW, WITH

04:14:12.637 --> 04:14:14.205
HER OPPOSITION. SO AND WHEN

04:14:14.272 --> 04:14:15.573
WOULD YOU BE PRESENTING THAT

04:14:15.640 --> 04:14:17.008
GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE, LIKE AT

04:14:17.075 --> 04:14:17.909
WHAT THIS IS GOING TO HAVE TO

04:14:17.976 --> 04:14:20.979
BE? YOU KNOW, AS I SAY, WE'RE

04:14:21.045 --> 04:14:22.113
HAVING A SERIES OF COMMUNITY

04:14:22.180 --> 04:14:23.181
MEETINGS AND THEN IT'LL HAVE TO

04:14:23.247 --> 04:14:25.249
COME TOGETHER OVER THE SUMMER OR

04:14:25.316 --> 04:14:26.584
NOT. AND IF IT DOESN'T, OKAY,

04:14:26.651 --> 04:14:28.886
THEN IF IT DOESN'T IN A, IN A

04:14:28.953 --> 04:14:30.955
WAY THAT BUILDS GREATER

04:14:31.022 --> 04:14:31.789
CONSENSUS, WE'RE NOT GOING TO

04:14:31.856 --> 04:14:34.826
PURSUE IT THIS YEAR. OKAY. THANK

04:14:34.892 --> 04:14:35.426
YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION.

04:14:35.493 --> 04:14:36.494
THANK YOU. SEEING NOBODY ELSE

04:14:36.561 --> 04:14:39.631

ALSO, SENATOR Dð SENATOR.

COMMENTS AND YOUR COMMENTS WHERE

YOU DON'T SEE THIS BEING

04:14:55.213 --> 04:14:57.382
SUCCESSFUL, ALSO, I BELIEVE THAT

04:14:57.448 --> 04:14:59.183
WE ALSO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

04:14:59.250 --> 04:15:01.619
BRING IT BACK 100%. IF WHATEVER

04:15:01.686 --> 04:15:03.021
HAPPENS THROUGH THE SUMMER, WE

04:15:03.087 --> 04:15:05.223
CONTINUE THESE CONVERSATIONS, WE

04:15:05.289 --> 04:15:06.391
CAN ALWAYS BRING IT BACK TO THE

04:15:15.400 --> 04:15:15.967
OPTION TO FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS

04:15:16.034 --> 04:15:18.002

AS THE CAPITAL CITY, WHERE THERE

04:18:37.001 --> 04:18:40.605
IS OBVIOUSLY ALL OF US, A HEAVY

04:18:40.671 --> 04:18:42.673
STATE GOVERNMENT PRESENCE WHICH

04:18:42.740 --> 04:18:44.942
LIMITS SOME OF OUR LOCAL REVENUE

04:18:45.009 --> 04:18:47.078
AND SOME OF OUR DEVELOPMENT

04:18:47.144 --> 04:18:49.947
CAPACITY. ALTHOUGH IT NOW WILL

04:18:50.014 --> 04:18:51.349
APPLY STATEWIDE, THE BILL WAS

04:18:51.415 --> 04:18:52.750
CRAFTED TO FILL A CRITICAL

04:18:52.817 --> 04:18:55.253
FUNDING GAP IN SACRAMENTO BY

04:18:55.319 --> 04:18:56.821
EXPANDING THE AUTHORITY OF

04:18:56.888 --> 04:18:58.189
ENHANCED INFRASTRUCTURE

04:18:58.256 --> 04:18:59.924
FINANCING DISTRICTS, WHICH THOSE

04:18:59.991 --> 04:19:01.359
OF YOU FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT

04:19:01.425 --> 04:19:03.694
KNOW. AIFD IS A WONDERFUL TOOL

04:19:03.761 --> 04:19:06.163
THAT WE ALL OFTEN USE IN

04:19:06.230 --> 04:19:07.832
DEVELOPMENT. OVER 60% OF

04:19:07.899 --> 04:19:10.134
DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO IS OWNED OR

04:19:10.201 --> 04:19:11.469
LEASED BY THE STATE AND IS

04:19:11.535 --> 04:19:14.472
EXEMPT, THEREFORE, FROM PROPERTY

04:19:14.538 --> 04:19:16.207
TAXES, NEARLY SIX TIMES THE

04:19:16.274 --> 04:19:18.676
LEVEL OF STATE OWNERSHIP SEEN IN

04:19:18.743 --> 04:19:20.444
ANY OTHER CITY IN CALIFORNIA. AS

04:19:20.511 --> 04:19:22.280
A RESULT, THE CITY SEES VERY

04:19:22.346 --> 04:19:24.916
LITTLE TAX REVENUE FROM ITS

04:19:24.982 --> 04:19:26.584
DOWNTOWN, BUT IT IS STILL

04:19:26.651 --> 04:19:28.019
RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF THE USUAL

04:19:28.085 --> 04:19:30.288
THINGS MAINTAINING THE ROADS,

04:19:30.354 --> 04:19:32.390
EMERGENCY AND ESSENTIAL PUBLIC

04:19:32.456 --> 04:19:33.891
SERVICES FOR ALL OF THOSE

04:19:33.958 --> 04:19:34.859
PROPERTIES, INCLUDING THE ONE

04:19:34.926 --> 04:19:36.727
WE'RE IN TODAY, WHICH CAN

04:19:36.794 --> 04:19:38.262
SOMETIMES TAKE A LOT OF

04:19:38.329 --> 04:19:40.331
RESOURCES. THE LACK OF FLEXIBLE

04:19:40.398 --> 04:19:41.565
FINANCING TOOLS, REALLY, ACROSS

04:19:41.632 --> 04:19:43.267
THE WHOLE STATE, HAS MADE IT

04:19:43.334 --> 04:19:45.369
HARDER FOR CITIES TO INVEST IN

04:19:45.436 --> 04:19:47.238
INFILL IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT,

04:19:47.305 --> 04:19:48.739
INCLUDING DOWNTOWNS JUST LIKE

04:19:48.806 --> 04:19:50.041
THIS ONE, WHICH LIMITS THE

04:19:50.107 --> 04:19:51.909
CITY'S ABILITY TO BUILD A

04:19:51.976 --> 04:19:53.611
VIBRANT AND SUSTAINABLE URBAN

04:19:53.678 --> 04:19:55.513
CENTER. WITHOUT THIS TOOL,

04:19:55.579 --> 04:19:57.515
CITIES LIKE SACRAMENTO ARE LEFT

04:19:57.581 --> 04:19:59.750
WITH VERY LIMITED RESOURCES AND

04:19:59.817 --> 04:20:02.219
NO VIABLE FUNDING TO REINVEST IN

04:20:02.286 --> 04:20:05.523
THEIR REGION. THIS BILL

04:20:05.589 --> 04:20:07.358
HOPEFULLY WILL BRING US MORE

04:20:07.425 --> 04:20:08.492
OPPORTUNITY FOR INVESTMENT, AND

04:20:08.559 --> 04:20:10.594
I HOPE THAT IT WORKS FOR EVERY

04:20:10.661 --> 04:20:11.462
CITY. EVEN THOUGH I INTRODUCED

04:20:11.529 --> 04:20:12.797
IT FOR SACRAMENTO, I THINK THERE

04:20:12.863 --> 04:20:13.931
IS POSSIBILITY, ESPECIALLY FOR

04:20:13.998 --> 04:20:16.367
LOS ANGELES, AS THEY COME BACK

04:20:16.434 --> 04:20:17.902
FROM THE DEVASTATING FIRES AND

04:20:17.969 --> 04:20:19.337
LOOK FORWARD TO ALL OF THE

04:20:19.403 --> 04:20:20.671
WONDERFUL ECONOMIC INVESTMENTS

04:20:20.738 --> 04:20:21.939
THEY HAVE AHEAD. I THINK THIS IS

04:20:22.006 --> 04:20:24.308
A BILL THAT COULD HELP CITIES

04:20:24.375 --> 04:20:25.443
ACROSS THE GREAT STATE OF

04:20:25.509 --> 04:20:26.444
CALIFORNIA. SO I RESPECTFULLY

04:20:26.510 --> 04:20:28.946
ASK FOR YOUR VOTE AT THE RIGHT

04:20:29.013 --> 04:20:30.247
TIME. I BROUGHT WITH ME TODAY

04:20:30.314 --> 04:20:30.881
TWO REALLY INCREDIBLE PEOPLE I

04:20:30.948 --> 04:20:32.616
THINK YOU'LL ENJOY GETTING TO

04:20:32.683 --> 04:20:34.352
MEET. ONE IS MICHAEL ALT. HE'S

04:20:34.418 --> 04:20:35.419
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF

04:20:35.486 --> 04:20:36.954
SACRAMENTO'S DOWNTOWN

04:20:37.021 --> 04:20:38.589
PARTNERSHIP, A SORT OF UNIQUE

04:20:38.656 --> 04:20:39.657
BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP ENTITY.

04:20:39.724 --> 04:20:40.958
IT'S KIND OF LIKE A PBID, BUT

04:20:41.025 --> 04:20:42.927
ONLY FOR OUR URBAN CORE. HE'S

04:20:42.994 --> 04:20:44.495
HAD THAT JOB FOR MANY DECADES.

04:20:44.562 --> 04:20:45.629
NO ONE KNOWS DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO

04:20:45.696 --> 04:20:47.098
BETTER THAN MICHAEL ALT AND

04:20:47.164 --> 04:20:48.566
ROBERT HITE, WHO'S THE PRESIDENT

04:20:48.632 --> 04:20:50.201
AND CEO OF SACRAMENTO'S METRO

04:20:50.267 --> 04:20:52.103
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. SO ALL OF

04:20:52.169 --> 04:20:54.205
OUR BUSINESSES IN THE GREATER

04:20:54.271 --> 04:20:55.940
SACRAMENTO REGION WELCOME THEM

04:20:56.007 --> 04:21:00.277
BOTH. MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU,

04:21:00.344 --> 04:21:02.079
CHAIR CARRILLO, MEMBERS OF THE

04:21:02.146 --> 04:21:03.481
COMMITTEE, MICHAEL ALT,

04:21:03.547 --> 04:21:04.115
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE

04:21:04.181 --> 04:21:06.017
DOWNTOWN PARTNERSHIP, THE FIRST

04:21:06.083 --> 04:21:07.551
BUSINESS IMPROVEMENT DISTRICT IN

04:21:07.618 --> 04:21:10.388
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SINCE

04:21:10.454 --> 04:21:12.957
1995. AT ITS CORE, AS A SENATOR

04:21:13.024 --> 04:21:13.958
TALKED ABOUT, WE INITIALLY

04:21:14.025 --> 04:21:15.092
LOOKED AT THIS AS A DISTRICT

04:21:15.159 --> 04:21:17.895
BILL, BUT SB 516 REALLY IS

04:21:17.962 --> 04:21:19.296
INTENDED TO DELIVER FLEXIBLE

04:21:19.363 --> 04:21:21.198
FRAMEWORK TO FACILITATE WHAT WE

04:21:21.265 --> 04:21:23.300
SEE AS MULTI-JURISDICTIONAL

04:21:23.367 --> 04:21:24.402
INFRASTRUCTURE AND INFILL

04:21:24.468 --> 04:21:25.803
INVESTMENT IN SACRAMENTO'S URBAN

04:21:25.870 --> 04:21:28.672
CORE. WHEN WE LOOK AT DOWNTOWN

04:21:28.739 --> 04:21:30.441
SACRAMENTO, AS YOU HEARD, 60% OF

04:21:30.508 --> 04:21:32.543
OUR INVENTORY IS CONTROLLED BY

04:21:32.610 --> 04:21:34.445
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN

04:21:34.512 --> 04:21:36.580
OFFICE. AND FOR CONTEXT, NO

04:21:36.647 --> 04:21:38.849
OTHER DOWNTOWN HAS MORE THAN 10%

04:21:38.916 --> 04:21:40.885
OF ITS TOTAL OFFICE INVENTORY

04:21:40.951 --> 04:21:42.286
OWNED BY THE STATE. SO WE REALLY

04:21:42.353 --> 04:21:44.221
THINK THAT THIS IS AN

04:21:44.288 --> 04:21:45.389
OPPORTUNITY FOR A UNIQUE

04:21:45.456 --> 04:21:47.058
SOLUTION. THE CURRENT REALITY

04:21:47.124 --> 04:21:48.125
PUTS LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND

04:21:48.192 --> 04:21:49.960
GENERAL FUNDS REALLY AT RISK,

04:21:50.027 --> 04:21:51.729
AND PROJECTS THAT WILL BE

04:21:51.796 --> 04:21:53.431
NEEDED. HOUSING, HOSPITALITY AND

04:21:53.497 --> 04:21:55.066
OTHER CATALYTIC PROJECTS CAN

04:21:55.132 --> 04:21:56.734
COME IN TO COMPLEMENT THE

04:21:56.801 --> 04:21:58.035
BACKBONE OF STATE GOVERNMENT

04:21:58.102 --> 04:21:59.804
THAT WE THINK COULD BACKFILL A

04:21:59.870 --> 04:22:01.472
LOT OF THESE OPPORTUNITY SITES.

04:22:01.539 --> 04:22:02.907
THERE ARE PRECEDENT IN OTHER

04:22:02.973 --> 04:22:05.776
CAPITAL CITIES WHEN WE LOOK AT

04:22:05.843 --> 04:22:07.344
DOWNTOWN'S STATE OF NEW YORK'S

04:22:07.411 --> 04:22:09.046
INVESTMENT IN DOWNTOWN ALBANY,

04:22:09.113 --> 04:22:11.148
BOSTON'S INVESTMENT WITH PAY IN

04:22:11.215 --> 04:22:13.684
LIEU, PAYMENT IN LIEU PILOT

04:22:13.751 --> 04:22:14.819
PROGRAMS HAVE MADE HUGE

04:22:14.885 --> 04:22:15.920
DIFFERENCES IN THEIR URBAN

04:22:15.986 --> 04:22:18.489
CORES. SB 516, IT'S IMPORTANT TO

04:22:18.556 --> 04:22:19.857
NOTE, DOES NOT, AT THIS POINT

04:22:19.924 --> 04:22:21.192
CONTAIN ANY FISCAL OBLIGATIONS

04:22:21.258 --> 04:22:23.094
TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, NOR

04:22:23.160 --> 04:22:24.628
DOES IT PROHIBIT OTHER DISTRICTS

04:22:24.695 --> 04:22:26.931
FROM MULTI-JURISDICTIONAL

04:22:26.997 --> 04:22:28.099
PARTICIPATION. BUT WHAT IT DOES

04:22:28.165 --> 04:22:30.134
DO IT SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGES

04:22:30.201 --> 04:22:31.435
THAT CALIFORNIA'S OWN CAPITAL

04:22:31.502 --> 04:22:33.237
CITY FACES UNIQUE CHALLENGES DUE

04:22:33.304 --> 04:22:35.372
TO THE SIGNIFICANT INVENTORY OF

04:22:35.439 --> 04:22:36.774
STATE OWNED PROPERTIES THAT ARE

04:22:36.841 --> 04:22:39.043
TAX EXEMPT, AND IN THESE AREAS

04:22:39.110 --> 04:22:42.213
THAT TYPICALLY SEE THE HIGHEST

04:22:42.279 --> 04:22:43.581
GENERATION OF TAXABLE REVENUE

04:22:43.647 --> 04:22:45.082
FOR THEIR URBAN CORES. WE THINK

04:22:45.149 --> 04:22:47.084
THIS IS AN EXCITING OPPORTUNITY.

04:22:47.151 --> 04:22:48.285
WHEN WE LOOK AT DOWNTOWN

04:22:48.352 --> 04:22:49.487
SACRAMENTO, REGIONS ARE DEFINED

04:22:49.553 --> 04:22:51.856
BY THEIR DOWNTOWNS, AND FOR US,

04:22:51.922 --> 04:22:53.791
THIS WOULD BE A GAME CHANGER FOR

04:22:53.858 --> 04:22:55.226
US. WE WANT TO THANK SENATOR

04:22:55.292 --> 04:22:57.394
ASHBY FOR HER UNWAVERING SUPPORT

04:22:57.461 --> 04:23:02.700
AND ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT SB 516.

04:23:02.766 --> 04:23:04.034
SORRY. GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU

04:23:04.101 --> 04:23:05.903
VERY MUCH. I'M ROBERT HIGHT, AS

04:23:05.970 --> 04:23:06.937
SENATOR ASHBY MENTIONED,

04:23:07.004 --> 04:23:08.806
PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE

04:23:08.873 --> 04:23:09.440
SACRAMENTO METROPOLITAN CHAMBER

04:23:09.507 --> 04:23:11.642
OF COMMERCE. AND YOU KNOW, FOR

04:23:11.709 --> 04:23:13.377
US, WE'RE WE'RE AT THE HEARTBEAT

04:23:13.444 --> 04:23:14.812
OF BUSINESS EVERY SINGLE DAY.

04:23:14.879 --> 04:23:16.213
AND WHILE WE SERVE SIX COUNTIES

04:23:16.280 --> 04:23:18.482
IN 22 CITIES IN THE REGION,

04:23:18.549 --> 04:23:20.317
HAVING A STRONG URBAN CORE IS

04:23:20.384 --> 04:23:22.653
VITAL. AND I THINK IT'S EXCITING

04:23:22.720 --> 04:23:23.988
TO SEE THIS BILL COME FORWARD

04:23:24.054 --> 04:23:25.022
FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. WHILE I

04:23:25.089 --> 04:23:26.123
THINK SELFISHLY, IT STARTED AS

04:23:26.190 --> 04:23:28.092
KIND OF LOOKING AT SACRAMENTO,

04:23:28.159 --> 04:23:29.326
THE ABILITY FOR OTHER CITIES

04:23:29.393 --> 04:23:31.128
LIKE LA AND OTHERS TO BE ABLE TO

04:23:31.195 --> 04:23:32.930
BENEFIT FROM THIS FRAMEWORK AND

04:23:32.997 --> 04:23:33.531
LEGISLATION COULD BE A GAME

04:23:33.597 --> 04:23:35.099
CHANGER FOR US. YOU KNOW, AS I

04:23:35.166 --> 04:23:36.834
TALK WITH MY OTHER CHAMBER

04:23:36.901 --> 04:23:37.701
COLLEAGUES, THEY ALL RECOGNIZE,

04:23:37.768 --> 04:23:39.737
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN THE CHAMBER

04:23:39.803 --> 04:23:40.337
INDUSTRY FOR A LONG TIME. THE

04:23:40.404 --> 04:23:41.805
UNIQUENESS THAT WE SIT RIGHT

04:23:41.872 --> 04:23:43.107
HERE IN THE FOURTH LARGEST

04:23:43.174 --> 04:23:44.775
ECONOMY OF THE WORLD OF, OF

04:23:44.842 --> 04:23:46.877
CALIFORNIA, AND, YOU KNOW, WITH

04:23:46.944 --> 04:23:48.712
THE AMOUNT OF BUILDINGS THAT ARE

04:23:48.779 --> 04:23:50.114
OWNED BY THE GOVERNMENT, IT

04:23:50.181 --> 04:23:50.948
PROHIBITS US FROM REALLY WORKING

04:23:51.015 --> 04:23:52.449
WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO

04:23:52.516 --> 04:23:53.851
DEVELOP AND WORK ON INFILL

04:23:53.918 --> 04:23:55.586
PROJECTS AND REALLY BE A

04:23:55.653 --> 04:23:57.721
CATALYST FOR CHANGE. SO THIS IS

04:23:57.788 --> 04:24:00.724
A TOOL, I BELIEVE, FOR US TO

04:24:00.791 --> 04:24:01.992
REALLY INVIGORATE WHAT OUR

04:24:02.059 --> 04:24:03.827
DOWNTOWN CAN BE. WE'VE GOT SOME

04:24:03.894 --> 04:24:05.162
GREAT PARTNERS AND OPPORTUNITIES

04:24:05.229 --> 04:24:06.997
FOR US TO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP IN

04:24:07.064 --> 04:24:11.135
THIS. REALLY, IT'S GIVING US

04:24:11.202 --> 04:24:13.604
TODAY'S FLEXIBILITY AND THE

04:24:13.671 --> 04:24:15.005
TOOLS THAT WE NEED TO BE

04:24:15.072 --> 04:24:16.140
CREATIVE IN THE ECONOMY TO WORK

04:24:16.207 --> 04:24:18.108
WITH BUSINESSES. NO TWO PROJECTS

04:24:18.175 --> 04:24:20.110
ARE THE SAME WHEN YOU'RE DEALING

04:24:20.177 --> 04:24:20.811
WITH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. WE

04:24:20.878 --> 04:24:22.613
NEED AS MANY TOOLS IN THE

04:24:22.680 --> 04:24:24.315
TOOLBOX TO BE COMPETITIVE AS

04:24:24.381 --> 04:24:25.883
POSSIBLE. SO WITH THAT, THE

04:24:25.950 --> 04:24:27.985
METRO CHAMBER SITS ALONGSIDE OF

04:24:28.052 --> 04:24:29.720

APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION.

THANK YOU. ANYBODY ELSE THAT

04:24:37.428 --> 04:24:39.530
WANTS TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT,

04:24:39.597 --> 04:24:40.164
PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME,

04:24:40.231 --> 04:24:42.299

GOOD AFTERNOON, CHAIR SCOTT

FORD. ON BEHALF OF MORE THAN 400

04:24:54.411 --> 04:24:56.680
LOCALLY OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES

HERE IN DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO.

MUCH, MISTER CHAIR. AND THANK

THE STAFF VERY MUCH FOR YOUR

04:27:28.432 --> 04:27:30.234
ASSISTANCE ON THIS BILL. I WILL

04:27:30.300 --> 04:27:31.835
BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE'S

04:27:31.902 --> 04:27:34.271
AMENDMENT. SB 838 IS ABOUT

04:27:34.338 --> 04:27:36.206
KEEPING OUR STRONGEST HOUSING

04:27:36.273 --> 04:27:38.442
LAW, THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY

04:27:38.509 --> 04:27:40.277
ACT, FOCUSED ON WHAT IT WAS

04:27:40.344 --> 04:27:43.080
DESIGNED TO DO BUILD HOMES. THE

04:27:43.147 --> 04:27:45.315
H.R. WAS CREATED TO ACCELERATE

04:27:45.382 --> 04:27:47.451
HOUSING PRODUCTION, NOT TO

04:27:47.518 --> 04:27:49.286
STREAMLINE THE DEVELOPMENT OF

04:27:49.353 --> 04:27:51.088
HOTELS AND RESORTS. BUT LATELY,

04:27:51.155 --> 04:27:52.890
WE'VE SEEN DEVELOPERS USING

04:27:52.956 --> 04:27:56.026
HOUSING LAWS TO FAST TRACK HOTEL

04:27:56.093 --> 04:27:58.162
PROJECTS, EVEN IN AREAS WHERE

04:27:58.228 --> 04:28:00.164
HOTELS WOULD NORMALLY BE BLOCKED

04:28:00.230 --> 04:28:02.599
BY LOCAL ZONING. SOME HOTEL

04:28:02.666 --> 04:28:03.934
COMPONENTS HAVE EVEN BEEN ADDED

04:28:04.001 --> 04:28:05.803
LATE, IN THE PROCESS, CUTTING

04:28:05.869 --> 04:28:07.171
DOWN THE NUMBER OF HOMES

04:28:07.237 --> 04:28:09.006
ORIGINALLY PROPOSED. WE SAW THAT

04:28:09.072 --> 04:28:10.774
HAPPEN IN BEVERLY HILLS AND

04:28:10.841 --> 04:28:12.943
SANTA MONICA. WE'VE ALSO SEEN

04:28:13.010 --> 04:28:14.845
HOTEL PROPOSALS PUSHED FORWARD

04:28:14.912 --> 04:28:17.247
IN FIRE PRONE AREAS WHERE ZONING

04:28:17.314 --> 04:28:19.116
WOULDN'T NORMALLY ALLOW THEM,

04:28:19.183 --> 04:28:20.551
LIKE THE SONOMA DEVELOPMENT

04:28:20.617 --> 04:28:22.052
CENTER AND THE MOUNTAIN WINERY

04:28:22.119 --> 04:28:23.787
IN SARATOGA. WE'VE SEEN

04:28:23.854 --> 04:28:25.255
DEVELOPERS SUBMIT THE SAME

04:28:25.322 --> 04:28:26.957
PROJECT IN MULTIPLE VERSIONS,

04:28:27.024 --> 04:28:29.159
SOME WITH HOTELS, SOME WITHOUT.

04:28:29.226 --> 04:28:30.961
IN SACRAMENTO, ONE VERSION

04:28:31.028 --> 04:28:33.464
INCLUDED A 300 ROOM HOTEL AND

04:28:33.530 --> 04:28:36.467
NEARLY 100 FEWER HOMES. THE

04:28:36.533 --> 04:28:38.268
OTHER VERSION DROPPED THE HOTEL

04:28:38.335 --> 04:28:41.505
AND ADDED 96 MORE HOMES. THAT

04:28:41.572 --> 04:28:43.540
TELLS US THE PROJECT DOESN'T

04:28:43.607 --> 04:28:46.076
RELY ON THE HOTEL TO MOVE

04:28:46.143 --> 04:28:47.878
FORWARD. WHEN HOUSING.

04:28:47.945 --> 04:28:49.379
STREAMLINING LAWS ARE USED TO

04:28:49.446 --> 04:28:51.849
BUILD HOTELS, NOT HOMES. A FEW

04:28:51.915 --> 04:28:54.351
THINGS ARE RESULT WE LOSE

04:28:54.418 --> 04:28:56.186
LIMITED LAND THAT COULD HAVE

04:28:56.253 --> 04:28:57.688
GONE TO PERMANENT HOUSING. WE

04:28:57.754 --> 04:28:59.323
PUSHED LOW WAGE WORKERS FARTHER

04:28:59.389 --> 04:29:01.091
FROM WHERE THEY WORK. WE SHIFT

04:29:01.158 --> 04:29:04.428
THE FOCUS OF THE HA AWAY FROM

04:29:04.495 --> 04:29:06.230
HOUSING, AND WE RISK WEAKENING

04:29:06.296 --> 04:29:08.465
PUBLIC TRUST IN THE HOUSING LAWS

04:29:08.532 --> 04:29:10.167
THAT THIS LEGISLATURE HAS WORKED

04:29:10.234 --> 04:29:12.436
HARD TO PASS AND TO PROTECT.

04:29:12.503 --> 04:29:15.239
HOTELS ALSO BRING LASTING HOTEL

04:29:15.305 --> 04:29:17.508
IMPACTS, MAKE THEM BETTER SUITED

04:29:17.574 --> 04:29:20.210
FOR THE NORMAL LOCAL REVIEW, NOT

04:29:20.277 --> 04:29:22.412
FAST TRACKING. THIS TAKES A

04:29:22.479 --> 04:29:24.548
CLEAR STEP. IT REMOVES TRANSIENT

04:29:24.615 --> 04:29:26.316
LODGING FROM ELIGIBILITY UNDER

04:29:26.383 --> 04:29:29.319
STATE HOUSING, STREAMLINING

04:29:29.386 --> 04:29:32.756
LAWS. AND TO BE CLEAR, SB 838

04:29:32.823 --> 04:29:35.359
DOES NOT BAN HOTELS. WE ARE NOT

04:29:35.425 --> 04:29:37.227
OPPOSED TO HOTELS. ALL WE'RE

04:29:37.294 --> 04:29:39.129
SAYING IS, IF YOU WANT TO

04:29:39.196 --> 04:29:40.731
INCLUDE A HOTEL, THAT PART OF

04:29:40.797 --> 04:29:42.165
THE PROJECT SHOULD GO THROUGH

04:29:42.232 --> 04:29:45.502
THE REGULAR LOCAL PROCESS. SB

04:29:45.569 --> 04:29:47.604
838 IS TARGETED PRO HOUSING

04:29:47.671 --> 04:29:50.173
MEASURE AND RETAINS THE

04:29:50.240 --> 04:29:52.075
INTEGRITY OF THE HOUSING

04:29:52.142 --> 04:29:53.877
ACCOUNTABILITY ACT. WE WANT TO

04:29:53.944 --> 04:29:56.480
FOCUS ON HOUSING PRODUCTION. I'M

04:29:56.547 --> 04:29:57.648
JOINED TODAY BY TWO WITNESSES,

04:29:57.714 --> 04:30:01.718
MATT BROAD WITH UNITE HERE AND

04:30:01.785 --> 04:30:03.287
OSCAR CASTRO, HOUSING AND

04:30:06.723 --> 04:30:10.160
YOU MR. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR AND

04:30:10.227 --> 04:30:11.361

04:30:11.428 --> 04:30:12.729
BEHALF OF UNITE HERE

INTERNATIONAL UNION, WHO ARE

04:30:14.164 --> 04:30:17.067
PROUD SPONSORS OF SB 838. THIS

04:30:17.134 --> 04:30:19.102
BILL IN CONCEPT IS VERY SIMPLE.

04:30:19.169 --> 04:30:20.304
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO CLARIFY

04:30:20.370 --> 04:30:22.839
THAT STREAMLINING UNDER THE H.R.

04:30:22.906 --> 04:30:24.875
IS FOR HOUSING PROJECTS AND NOT

04:30:24.942 --> 04:30:26.877
INADVERTENTLY, HOTELS, WHICH HAS

04:30:26.944 --> 04:30:28.979
BEEN THE STATUS QUO OVER THE

04:30:29.046 --> 04:30:31.481
COURSE OF THE HA FOR THE PAST 50

04:30:31.548 --> 04:30:33.517
YEARS. WE PUT SIMILAR LANGUAGE

04:30:33.584 --> 04:30:34.685
IN A NUMBER OF STREAMLINING

04:30:34.751 --> 04:30:36.286
BILLS THIS COMMITTEE HAS ALREADY

04:30:36.353 --> 04:30:38.722
SEEN THIS YEAR AND LAST YEAR,

04:30:38.789 --> 04:30:41.058
INCLUDING AB 130, THE INFILL

04:30:41.124 --> 04:30:44.361
BUDGET TRAILER BILL, AB 87, SB

92, AB 507 AS WELL AS AB 1893

04:30:48.932 --> 04:30:52.402
AND AB 3068 LAST YEAR. AND

04:30:52.469 --> 04:30:53.804
THEREIN LIES THE NEED FOR THIS

04:30:53.870 --> 04:30:56.039
BILL. INSTEAD OF PLAYING WHACK A

04:30:56.106 --> 04:30:57.808
MOLE WITH EVERY NEW STREAMLINING

04:30:57.874 --> 04:30:59.610
BILL THAT'S INTRODUCED, WE'D

04:30:59.676 --> 04:31:02.145
LIKE TO JUST CITE TO THE

04:31:02.212 --> 04:31:03.246
DEFINITION OF A MIXED USE

04:31:03.313 --> 04:31:04.948
HOUSING PROJECT IN THE H.R,

04:31:05.015 --> 04:31:06.683
WHICH MANY OF OUR STATE

04:31:06.750 --> 04:31:09.319
STREAMLINING LAWS FLOW FROM. SO

04:31:09.386 --> 04:31:10.687
I JUST WANT TO THANK THE

04:31:10.754 --> 04:31:12.155
COMMITTEE AND REITERATE THAT WE

04:31:12.222 --> 04:31:15.192
ARE REMOVING RETROACTIVITY FROM

04:31:15.258 --> 04:31:17.127
THE BILL, AND THAT WE HAD ROBUST

04:31:17.194 --> 04:31:18.629
DISCUSSIONS THIS MORNING WITH

04:31:18.695 --> 04:31:20.831
THE OPPOSITION, REALLY FOR THE

04:31:20.897 --> 04:31:23.300
FIRST TIME. AND I THINK WE'RE

04:31:23.367 --> 04:31:25.836
ALL COMMITTED TO TRYING TO MAKE

04:31:25.902 --> 04:31:27.871
SURE THAT THE BILL AS IS AS

04:31:27.938 --> 04:31:30.407
NARROWLY FOCUSED AND TARGETED ON

04:31:30.474 --> 04:31:32.509
HOTEL, MAKING SURE THAT HOTELS

04:31:32.576 --> 04:31:33.777
AREN'T STREAMLINING AND OF

04:31:33.844 --> 04:31:36.013
COURSE, NOT CATCHING UP GOOD

04:31:36.079 --> 04:31:38.015
HOUSING PROJECTS. AND WITH THAT,

04:31:38.081 --> 04:31:39.249
OBVIOUSLY WE NEED THE BILL TO

04:31:39.316 --> 04:31:42.085
MOVE FORWARD TODAY, AND WE WOULD

04:31:42.152 --> 04:31:43.053
RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE.

BASED COMMUNITY GROUP THAT

04:31:57.234 --> 04:31:59.036
TACKLES THE ROOT CAUSES OF

04:31:59.102 --> 04:31:59.936
INEQUALITY AND POVERTY BY

PROUD TO SUPPORT SB 38 BY

SENATOR DURAZO. THIS BILL IS

04:32:10.914 --> 04:32:12.382
CRUCIAL IN ENSURING CALIFORNIA'S

04:32:12.449 --> 04:32:14.484
HOUSING STREAMLINING LAWS REMAIN

04:32:14.551 --> 04:32:15.852
FOCUSED ON JUST THAT,

04:32:15.919 --> 04:32:17.421
FACILITATING THE DEVELOPMENT OF

04:32:17.487 --> 04:32:18.855
AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR OUR

KNOW FROM ALL OUR WORK, WE ARE

04:32:23.960 --> 04:32:26.329
IN THE MIDST OF A SEVERE HOUSING

04:32:26.396 --> 04:32:27.564
CRISIS WITH GROWING IMPACTS SUCH

04:32:27.631 --> 04:32:29.166
AS HOUSING INSECURITY AND

04:32:29.232 --> 04:32:30.701
INCREASED HOMELESSNESS. WE ARE

04:32:30.767 --> 04:32:33.270
ALL DOING OUR WORK TO TRY TO

04:32:33.336 --> 04:32:35.072
IMPLEMENT HOUSING SOLUTIONS, AND

04:32:35.138 --> 04:32:36.807
WE HAVE SEEN EFFORTS OVER THE

04:32:36.873 --> 04:32:38.241
PAST SEVERAL YEARS THAT ARE

04:32:38.308 --> 04:32:40.343
GEARED TOWARDS EXPEDITING THE

04:32:40.410 --> 04:32:41.445
PRODUCTION OF AFFORDABLE

04:32:41.511 --> 04:32:43.246
HOUSING. THESE ARE VENERABLE

04:32:43.313 --> 04:32:44.715
GOALS. THESE ARE GOALS THAT WE

04:32:44.781 --> 04:32:46.550
SUPPORT, AND WE HAVE CONTINUED

04:32:46.616 --> 04:32:47.884
AND WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT

04:32:47.951 --> 04:32:49.519
EFFORTS SUCH AS THESE. HOWEVER,

04:32:49.586 --> 04:32:50.320
THERE'S A GROWING CONCERN THAT

04:32:50.387 --> 04:32:52.089
THE BENEFITS OF THESE

04:32:52.155 --> 04:32:53.323
STREAMLINING LAWS ARE BEING

04:32:53.390 --> 04:32:54.925
EXTENDED TO HOTEL DEVELOPMENTS.

04:32:54.991 --> 04:32:56.593
THIS SHIFT DIVERTS RESOURCES AND

04:32:56.660 --> 04:32:57.928
ATTENTION AWAY FROM BUILDING

04:32:57.994 --> 04:33:00.197
HOMES, WHICH WE NEED, AND

04:33:00.263 --> 04:33:02.065
HOTELS, WHILE BENEFICIAL FOR

04:33:02.132 --> 04:33:03.533
TOURISM IN SOME ASPECTS, DO NOT

04:33:03.600 --> 04:33:05.268
ADDRESS THE PRESSING NEED FOR

04:33:05.335 --> 04:33:08.071
PERMANENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SB

04:33:08.138 --> 04:33:10.240

04:33:12.843 --> 04:33:14.244
INTENDED SOLELY FOR HOUSING

04:33:14.311 --> 04:33:16.279
PROJECTS, AND BY DOING SO, WE

04:33:16.346 --> 04:33:17.414
ENSURE THAT OUR POLICIES REMAIN

04:33:17.481 --> 04:33:19.182

HOMES OF ALL INCOME LEVELS FOR

OUR COMMUNITIES. WHEN THINKING

04:33:23.854 --> 04:33:25.355
ABOUT THE QUALITY OF A PROJECT,

04:33:25.422 --> 04:33:26.356
IT'S IMPORTANT TO WEIGH THE

04:33:26.423 --> 04:33:27.991

TOUGH ROAD HERE, BUT I'M VERY

04:36:48.491 --> 04:36:49.826
PROUD OF THE PROCESS THAT HAS

04:36:49.893 --> 04:36:52.696
BEEN USED. SO MANY ORGANIZATIONS

04:36:52.762 --> 04:36:55.365
THAT WE HAVE WORKED WITH AND TO

04:36:55.432 --> 04:36:56.733

04:36:56.800 --> 04:36:59.903

04:36:59.970 --> 04:37:02.405

THOUGHT WAS GOOD. AND WE'VE

04:37:04.941 --> 04:37:06.843
EVERYONE FROM THE ACLU, THE

04:37:06.910 --> 04:37:11.081
LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS, THE

ADVOCATES AND STAKEHOLDERS, ALL

04:37:21.958 --> 04:37:24.527
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO

04:37:24.594 --> 04:37:26.463
GET TO THE POINT OF MODERNIZING

04:37:26.529 --> 04:37:28.098
OUR BROWN ACT. SO I WANT TO

04:37:28.164 --> 04:37:29.165
THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR

04:37:29.232 --> 04:37:31.234
THEIR HARD WORK AND ACCEPT THE

04:37:31.301 --> 04:37:33.803
COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. THE BROWN

04:37:33.870 --> 04:37:37.374
ACT SINCE 1954 HAS SERVED AS THE

04:37:37.440 --> 04:37:39.876
MINIMUM STANDARD FOR HOW THE

04:37:39.943 --> 04:37:41.978
PUBLIC CAN ACCESS THEIR LOCAL

04:37:42.045 --> 04:37:43.446

04:37:43.513 --> 04:37:45.615
AGENCIES CONDUCT THOSE MEETINGS.

04:37:45.682 --> 04:37:47.650
BUT AS TECHNOLOGY HAS IMPROVED,

04:37:47.717 --> 04:37:50.020
THE LEGISLATURE HAS MADE CAREFUL

04:37:50.086 --> 04:37:51.755
CHANGES TO MODERNIZE THE BROWN

04:37:51.821 --> 04:37:54.591
ACT. IN ADDITION, THE PANDEMIC

HELPED BRING ALONG OTHER

04:37:56.593 --> 04:37:58.294
TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES. AND WE

04:37:58.361 --> 04:38:00.030
WENT THROUGH THIS HERE IN THE

04:38:00.096 --> 04:38:02.098
LEGISLATURE, IN OUR OWN

04:38:02.165 --> 04:38:05.068
BUILDINGS. 707 IS OUR

04:38:05.135 --> 04:38:07.637
OPPORTUNITY TO KEEP KEY

04:38:07.704 --> 04:38:10.440

THE SAME TIME, EXPAND PUBLIC

04:38:14.844 --> 04:38:16.546
ACCESS. HOWEVER, MANY

04:38:16.613 --> 04:38:17.714
COMMUNITIES AND GOVERNMENTS

04:38:17.781 --> 04:38:19.549
CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE

04:38:19.616 --> 04:38:22.018
CHALLENGES WITH THE BROWN ACT AS

04:38:22.085 --> 04:38:23.119
TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES HAVE

04:38:23.186 --> 04:38:26.689
OCCURRED, MANY DISABLED WORKING

04:38:26.756 --> 04:38:28.558
NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING COMMUNITIES

04:38:28.625 --> 04:38:31.761
FACE CHALLENGES ACCESSING PUBLIC

04:38:31.828 --> 04:38:33.830
MEETINGS AND MATERIALS. THIS

04:38:33.897 --> 04:38:35.698
BILL ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO

04:38:35.765 --> 04:38:38.168
SERVE THEIR COMMUNITIES BETTER,

04:38:38.234 --> 04:38:40.470
INCREASES THE PUBLIC'S ACCESS TO

04:38:40.537 --> 04:38:42.472
MEETINGS, ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE

04:38:42.539 --> 04:38:43.840
COMMUNITIES. THE BILL ALSO ADDS

04:38:43.907 --> 04:38:46.409
MORE TELECONFERENCING WITH

04:38:46.476 --> 04:38:48.745
GUARDRAILS AND THE ABILITY TO

04:38:53.817 --> 04:38:55.852
SEVERAL OTHER BROWN ACT BILLS

04:38:55.919 --> 04:38:58.354
HAVE JOINED TOGETHER. FOR

04:38:58.421 --> 04:39:00.490

SCHOOL SPECIAL DISTRICTS TO

04:39:22.679 --> 04:39:25.081
OTHERS. IF WE DO NOT MAKE

04:39:25.148 --> 04:39:27.150
UPDATES TO THE BROWN ACT, WE

04:39:27.217 --> 04:39:29.686
LOSE ON EXTENDING CURRENT

04:39:29.752 --> 04:39:31.087

LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FURTHER

04:39:35.859 --> 04:39:37.660
ENGAGE WITH THE PUBLIC. THIS

04:39:37.727 --> 04:39:40.530
BILL PROVIDES A VITAL PATH TO

04:39:40.597 --> 04:39:42.265

TO STUDENT PARTICIPATION IN

04:40:25.909 --> 04:40:27.377
GOVERNMENT MEETINGS. IT SHOWED

04:40:27.443 --> 04:40:28.711
THAT THE BROWN ACT, WHILE

04:40:28.778 --> 04:40:30.547
ESSENTIAL FOR TRANSPARENCY, WAS

04:40:30.613 --> 04:40:32.649
OVERDUE FOR A MUCH NEEDED

04:40:32.715 --> 04:40:34.717
MODERNIZATION. STUDENTS SHARED

04:40:34.784 --> 04:40:36.352
HOW IN-PERSON REQUIREMENTS

04:40:36.419 --> 04:40:38.421
SOMETIMES CREATED REAL RISKS AND

04:40:38.488 --> 04:40:39.756
BURDENS FROM SURVIVORS OF

04:40:39.822 --> 04:40:41.591
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHO FEARED

04:40:41.658 --> 04:40:43.226
DISCLOSING THEIR LOCATION TO

04:40:43.293 --> 04:40:44.827
STUDENT PARENTS WITHOUT RELIABLE

WITHOUT ACCESSIBLE

04:40:48.531 --> 04:40:50.233
TRANSPORTATION. THESE THESE

04:40:50.300 --> 04:40:51.701
STORIES WEREN'T RARE, AND THEY

04:40:51.768 --> 04:40:53.970
REFLECTED MANY STUDENTS EVERYDAY

04:40:54.037 --> 04:40:55.705
CHALLENGES WHILE TRYING TO SERVE

04:40:55.772 --> 04:40:57.407
THEIR COMMUNITIES. IN ADDITION

04:40:57.473 --> 04:40:58.608
TO CREATING SAFER AND MORE

04:40:58.675 --> 04:41:00.376

COLLEGE, FOR EXAMPLE, WHERE 53%

04:41:08.818 --> 04:41:11.621

04:41:11.688 --> 04:41:13.022
STUDENT LEADERS ARE MORE ENGAGED

04:41:13.089 --> 04:41:14.490

ACCESS MADE POSSIBLE BY THESE

04:41:15.959 --> 04:41:18.795

04:41:32.475 --> 04:41:33.910
NEXT CRITICAL STEP IN

04:41:33.977 --> 04:41:35.211
MODERNIZING PUBLIC

04:41:35.278 --> 04:41:36.746
PARTICIPATION. IT STRENGTHENS

04:41:36.813 --> 04:41:38.881
AND EXTENDS TELECONFERENCING

04:41:38.948 --> 04:41:40.250

MEETINGS THAT ARE ACCESSIBLE,

04:41:49.726 --> 04:41:51.894

04:41:57.934 --> 04:41:59.269

04:42:04.173 --> 04:42:05.308

04:42:19.722 --> 04:42:20.657

04:42:20.723 --> 04:42:21.691
EXTENSIVE CHANGES TO THE BROWN

04:42:21.758 --> 04:42:23.960
ACT IN DECADES. I WANT TO BEGIN

04:42:24.027 --> 04:42:25.328

CONCERNS ARE REAL, PARTICULARLY

04:42:31.801 --> 04:42:34.237

MANDATED COSTS FOR THE BROWN ACT

04:42:36.205 --> 04:42:39.075
DUE TO PASSAGE OF PROP 42.

04:42:39.142 --> 04:42:40.143
HOWEVER, IT IS OFTEN SAID THAT

THE DEFINITION OF A COMPROMISE

04:42:41.978 --> 04:42:43.813

04:42:45.548 --> 04:42:46.749

04:47:13.015 --> 04:47:14.784
SUBJECT TO A NEW, MORE ONEROUS

04:47:14.850 --> 04:47:16.619
LEVEL OF REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE

04:47:16.686 --> 04:47:19.021
BROWN ACT. CITIES OVER 30,000

04:47:19.088 --> 04:47:21.691
AND COUNTIES OVER 600,000 ARE TO

04:47:21.757 --> 04:47:23.793
BE DETERMINED TO BE ELIGIBLE.

04:47:23.859 --> 04:47:25.261
LEGISLATIVE BODIES. SPECIAL

04:47:25.328 --> 04:47:27.096
DISTRICTS WITH A WEBSITE WITH

04:47:27.163 --> 04:47:28.931
BOUNDARIES INCLUDING 200,000 OR

04:47:28.998 --> 04:47:31.067
MORE, ARE ALSO DETERMINED TO BE

04:47:31.133 --> 04:47:33.869
ELIGIBLE. LEGISLATIVE BODIES.

04:47:33.936 --> 04:47:34.904
PROBLEMATICALLY, SPECIAL

04:47:34.971 --> 04:47:37.473
DISTRICTS DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO

04:47:37.540 --> 04:47:40.042
THE CENSUS DATA RELATED TO THEIR

04:47:40.109 --> 04:47:42.612
BOUNDARIES. THIS IS SOMETHING

04:47:42.678 --> 04:47:44.046
THAT IS DISTINCT AND SEPARATE

04:47:44.113 --> 04:47:46.749
FROM CITIES AND COUNTIES, BUT

04:47:46.816 --> 04:47:47.883
SPECIAL DISTRICTS ARE ALSO

04:47:47.950 --> 04:47:49.018
DISTINCT FROM CITIES AND

04:47:49.085 --> 04:47:50.486
COUNTIES, AND THEIR ABILITY TO

04:47:50.553 --> 04:47:51.921
ABSORB THE IMPACTS ASSOCIATED

04:47:51.988 --> 04:47:54.223
WITH BEING DETERMINED ELIGIBLE.

04:47:54.290 --> 04:47:58.060
IF YOU LOOK AT 2023 DATA FOR

04:47:58.127 --> 04:47:59.462
CITIES OF POPULATIONS GREATER

04:47:59.528 --> 04:48:02.398
THAN 30,000, THEIR AVERAGE

04:48:02.465 --> 04:48:04.967
REVENUE COMES OUT TO ABOUT 431

04:48:05.034 --> 04:48:06.435
MILLION. IF YOU LOOK AT ALL

04:48:06.502 --> 04:48:07.803
SPECIAL DISTRICT REVENUE DURING

04:48:07.870 --> 04:48:09.538
THE SAME TIME PERIOD, IT'S LESS

04:48:09.605 --> 04:48:11.741
THAN 4% OF THAT FIGURE. FOR

04:48:11.807 --> 04:48:13.809
THESE REASONS, WE WOULD

04:48:13.876 --> 04:48:15.611
RESPECTFULLY URGE THAT THE BILL

04:48:15.678 --> 04:48:16.746
DEFINITION OF ELIGIBLE

04:48:16.812 --> 04:48:18.481
LEGISLATIVE BODIES BE AMENDED TO

04:48:18.547 --> 04:48:19.949
REVERT BACK TO A PREVIOUS

04:48:20.016 --> 04:48:21.083
DEFINITION THAT DID NOT INCLUDE

04:48:21.150 --> 04:48:24.286
SPECIAL DISTRICTS. ADDITIONALLY,

04:48:24.353 --> 04:48:25.755
OTHER ISSUES WITH THE BILL

04:48:25.821 --> 04:48:27.123
REMAIN COMMENTING ON THOSE

04:48:27.189 --> 04:48:29.158
ISSUES THAT RELATE TO CONFUSION

04:48:29.225 --> 04:48:31.060
AND INCREASED LITIGATION RISK.

04:48:31.127 --> 04:48:32.094
THERE IS LANGUAGE IN THE BILL

04:48:32.161 --> 04:48:33.562
THAT RELATES TO ELIGIBLE

04:48:33.629 --> 04:48:34.664
SUBSIDIARY BODIES THAT HAS

04:48:34.730 --> 04:48:36.298
INVITED QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER

04:48:36.365 --> 04:48:38.334
OR NOT CERTAIN BODIES ARE BEING

04:48:38.401 --> 04:48:39.669
LOCKED OUT OF ALTERNATIVE

04:48:39.735 --> 04:48:41.904
TELECONFERENCING RULES. THE

04:48:41.971 --> 04:48:43.706
REQUIREMENTS THAT RELATE TO

04:48:43.773 --> 04:48:45.841
IDENTIFYING LANGUAGES SPOKEN AND

04:48:45.908 --> 04:48:48.010
TRANSLATING MATERIALS FOR LARGE

04:48:48.077 --> 04:48:49.812
JURISDICTIONS LACK CLARITY. AND

04:48:49.879 --> 04:48:52.415
THAT'S NOT ALL. THIS BILL ALSO

04:48:52.481 --> 04:48:54.617
INCREASES THE TIME FRAME FOR

04:48:54.684 --> 04:48:55.418
INVALIDATION ACTIONS TO BE

04:48:55.484 --> 04:48:57.086
BROUGHT AGAINST A LOCAL AGENCY

04:48:57.153 --> 04:48:59.388
FROM NINE MONTHS TO 12 MONTHS,

04:48:59.455 --> 04:49:01.023
THEREBY CREATING AN ADDITIONAL

04:49:01.090 --> 04:49:03.192
TIME PERIOD FOR A BAD ACTOR TO

04:49:03.259 --> 04:49:04.927
LEVERAGE THIS PROVISION TO HOLD

04:49:04.994 --> 04:49:06.762
UP PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE

04:49:06.829 --> 04:49:07.897
PROJECTS THAT SUPPORT NEW

04:49:07.963 --> 04:49:09.265
HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS THAT ARE

04:49:09.331 --> 04:49:11.400
ALREADY OVERDUE IN CALIFORNIA'S

04:49:11.467 --> 04:49:12.368
COMMUNITIES. FOR THESE REASONS

04:49:12.435 --> 04:49:14.537
AND MORE, WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY

04:49:14.603 --> 04:49:16.105
URGE YOUR NO VOTE UNLESS THIS

04:49:16.172 --> 04:49:17.840
BILL IS AMENDED TO ADDRESS OUR

04:49:17.907 --> 04:49:19.475
CONCERNS. THANK YOU. GOOD

04:49:19.542 --> 04:49:20.509
EVENING, CHAIR AND COMMITTEE

04:49:20.576 --> 04:49:21.844
MEMBERS. MY NAME IS MARSHALL

04:49:21.911 --> 04:49:22.945
ARNWINE. I'M THE LEGISLATIVE

04:49:23.012 --> 04:49:23.946
ADVOCATE FOR THE AC OF

04:49:24.013 --> 04:49:26.315
CALIFORNIA ACTION AND RESPECTFUL

04:49:26.382 --> 04:49:28.350
OPPOSITION TO SB 707, AS

04:49:28.417 --> 04:49:30.219
AMENDED. WHILE WE SHARE SENATOR

04:49:30.286 --> 04:49:31.287
ROSSEAU'S COMMITMENT TO

04:49:31.353 --> 04:49:32.922
INCREASING PUBLIC PARTICIPATION

04:49:32.988 --> 04:49:34.490
IN LOCAL PUBLIC MEETINGS, WE

04:49:34.557 --> 04:49:37.359
REMAIN CONCERNED THAT SB 707

04:49:37.426 --> 04:49:38.861
PRIORITIZES THE CONVENIENCE FOR

04:49:38.928 --> 04:49:40.629
MEMBERS OF LOCAL LEGISLATIVE

04:49:40.696 --> 04:49:41.964
BODIES AT THE EXPENSE OF

04:49:42.031 --> 04:49:43.632
ESSENTIAL PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY

04:49:43.699 --> 04:49:45.701
AND ACCOUNTABILITY PROTECTIONS.

04:49:45.768 --> 04:49:47.036
THE AMENDMENT SIGNIFICANTLY

04:49:47.103 --> 04:49:48.871
UNDERMINED CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY

04:49:48.938 --> 04:49:50.706
TO BE HEARD AND TO BE

04:49:50.773 --> 04:49:51.741
MEANINGFULLY ENGAGED IN LOCAL

04:49:51.807 --> 04:49:52.942
GOVERNMENT DECISIONS FOR AT

04:49:53.008 --> 04:49:55.044
LEAST THREE REASONS. FIRST, IF

04:49:55.111 --> 04:49:56.746
THIS BILL IS PASSED, IT WILL

04:49:56.812 --> 04:49:58.981
ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS

04:49:59.048 --> 04:50:00.349
TO ELIMINATE REMOTE PUBLIC

04:50:00.416 --> 04:50:02.551
COMMENT FOR ALL DURING A MEETING

04:50:02.618 --> 04:50:05.054
IN THE EVENT OF A DISRUPTION.

04:50:05.121 --> 04:50:06.055
FOR EXAMPLE, EVEN THOUGH THE

04:50:06.122 --> 04:50:07.723
BROWN ACT HAS PROCEDURES FOR

04:50:07.790 --> 04:50:09.291
DEALING WITH DISRUPTIVE

04:50:09.358 --> 04:50:10.393
INDIVIDUALS, CURRENT LANGUAGE

04:50:10.459 --> 04:50:12.328
WILL ALLOW BODIES TO SHUT DOWN

04:50:12.394 --> 04:50:14.263
REMOTE PUBLIC COMMENT ENTIRELY

04:50:14.330 --> 04:50:16.031
BASED ON THE IMPLAUSIBLE CLAIM

04:50:16.098 --> 04:50:18.033
THAT MUTED REMOTE PARTICIPANTS

04:50:18.100 --> 04:50:19.969
CAN IMPEDE THE ORDERLY CONDUCT

04:50:20.035 --> 04:50:21.670
OF A MEETING. THIS CONFLICTS

04:50:21.737 --> 04:50:23.272
WITH THE BROWN ACT'S GUARANTEE

04:50:23.339 --> 04:50:25.574
OF THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC

04:50:25.641 --> 04:50:26.942
COMMENT AND RAISES FIRST

04:50:27.009 --> 04:50:29.545
AMENDMENT CONCERNS, ESPECIALLY

04:50:29.612 --> 04:50:30.980
UNCONSTITUTIONAL ASSOCIATIONAL

04:50:31.046 --> 04:50:33.182
LIMITED LIABILITY BASED ON

04:50:33.249 --> 04:50:34.917
SPEECH. SECOND, THIS BILL WOULD

04:50:34.984 --> 04:50:36.752
ALLOW AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF

04:50:36.819 --> 04:50:38.087
LOCAL GOVERNMENT MEETINGS ACROSS

04:50:38.154 --> 04:50:40.389
THE STATE TO TAKE PLACE ENTIRELY

04:50:40.456 --> 04:50:42.925
VIRTUALLY ALLOWING APPOINTEES TO

04:50:42.992 --> 04:50:44.593
SUBSIDIARY BODIES TO AVOID EVER

04:50:44.660 --> 04:50:46.128
SHOWING UP TO MEET IN PERSON.

04:50:46.195 --> 04:50:48.063
AND THIRD, THIS BILL WILL ONLY

04:50:48.130 --> 04:50:49.732
REQUIRE LIVE STREAMING AND

04:50:49.799 --> 04:50:51.367
REMOTE COMMENT OPTIONS FOR A

04:50:51.433 --> 04:50:53.702
SUBSET OF CITY COUNCILS AND

04:50:53.769 --> 04:50:55.805
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS BASED ON

04:50:55.871 --> 04:50:57.640
POPULATION SIZE. EVEN THOUGH

04:50:57.706 --> 04:50:59.375
EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT SMALL

04:50:59.441 --> 04:51:01.377
CITIES REGULARLY PROVIDE PUBLIC

04:51:01.443 --> 04:51:03.879
REMOTE ACCESS AT LOW COST, SMALL

04:51:03.946 --> 04:51:05.815
CITIES WILL STILL NEED TO COVER

04:51:05.881 --> 04:51:08.083
THE COST FOR PLATFORM FEES AND

04:51:08.150 --> 04:51:09.518
EQUIPMENT IN ORDER TO COMPLY

04:51:09.585 --> 04:51:11.687
WITH THE BILL'S REMOTE ACCESS

04:51:11.754 --> 04:51:13.289
ACCOMMODATION FOR BODY MEMBERS.

04:51:13.355 --> 04:51:14.924
IN CONCLUSION, WE URGE

04:51:14.990 --> 04:51:15.958
AMENDMENTS TO AT LEAST THE

04:51:16.025 --> 04:51:18.160

04:51:30.539 --> 04:51:32.541
ATTACH TO REMOTE FLEXIBILITY.

04:51:32.608 --> 04:51:33.742
GUARDRAILS CRITICAL TO

04:51:33.809 --> 04:51:35.277
ACCOUNTABILITY AND THREE REQUIRE

04:51:35.344 --> 04:51:37.379

04:51:41.150 --> 04:51:43.485
USED IT IN THE PAST. WE CONTINUE

04:51:43.552 --> 04:51:45.221

PACHECO, THANK YOU AND THANK

YOU, SENATOR. SO IT LOOKS LIKE

04:55:31.046 --> 04:55:32.047
SOME AMENDMENTS HAVE ALREADY

04:55:32.114 --> 04:55:34.550
BEEN MADE, AND IT LOOKS LIKE

04:55:34.616 --> 04:55:35.884
YOU'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH

04:55:35.951 --> 04:55:38.320
OPPOSITION TO PERFECT THIS BILL.

ASSOCIATION MAKES A VALID

04:55:42.257 --> 04:55:45.360
POINTS. SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN TRY

04:55:45.427 --> 04:55:46.495
TO CARVE THEM OUT OR DO

04:55:46.562 --> 04:55:48.630
SOMETHING TO HELP THEM WITH

04:55:48.697 --> 04:55:50.833
THEIR ISSUE. I WILL BE

04:55:50.899 --> 04:55:52.201
SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY, BUT

04:55:52.267 --> 04:55:54.770
I JUST HOPE THESE COMING THESE

04:55:54.837 --> 04:55:56.171
CONVERSATIONS ARE ARE

04:55:56.238 --> 04:55:58.006
MEANINGFUL. WE GET TO A PLACE

04:55:58.073 --> 04:56:00.976
WHERE WE CAN ALL SUPPORT THIS

04:56:01.043 --> 04:56:03.745
BILL ON THE FLOOR. AND THANK YOU

04:56:03.812 --> 04:56:05.013

THANK YOU. KNOW, I, I WOULD LOVE

04:56:16.158 --> 04:56:17.526
TO WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE

04:56:17.593 --> 04:56:19.928
SENATOR FOR TAKING ON THE

04:56:19.995 --> 04:56:22.231
CONVERSATION. I KNOW MY BILL IS

04:56:22.297 --> 04:56:24.333
NOW MERGED INTO THIS BILL. SO I

04:56:24.399 --> 04:56:26.869
THINK WE HAVE TO COME TO A

04:56:26.935 --> 04:56:28.237
CONSENSUS, BECAUSE A LOT OF THE

04:56:28.303 --> 04:56:29.404
PROVISIONS THAT YOU'RE TALKING

04:56:29.471 --> 04:56:31.473
ABOUT WERE IN MY BILL

04:56:31.540 --> 04:56:33.775
SPECIFICALLY. ALSO, I'M

04:56:33.842 --> 04:56:35.210
SURPRISED THE REASON THAT I DID

04:56:35.277 --> 04:56:36.445
THE BROWN ACT BILL ORIGINALLY

04:56:36.512 --> 04:56:38.380
WAS BECAUSE OF THREE THREE

04:56:38.447 --> 04:56:39.581
VALLEYS MUNICIPAL WATER

04:56:39.648 --> 04:56:42.017
DISTRICT. AND SO I SAW A LOT OF

04:56:42.084 --> 04:56:44.052
OUR WATER FOLKS IN OPPOSITION,

04:56:44.119 --> 04:56:46.388
AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT

04:56:46.455 --> 04:56:49.124
WE FIND SOME CONSENSUS AGAIN, OF

04:56:49.191 --> 04:56:50.325
THREE VALLEYS WAS THE ORIGINAL

04:56:50.392 --> 04:56:51.660
SPONSOR OF THE BROWN ACT BILL.

04:56:51.727 --> 04:56:53.862
AND SO I KNOW AND I'VE BEEN IN

04:56:53.929 --> 04:56:54.963
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SENATOR

04:56:55.030 --> 04:56:57.132
ABOUT ADDRESSING THE ISSUES THAT

04:56:57.199 --> 04:56:58.867
MARCUS, YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT

04:56:58.934 --> 04:57:00.802
SPECIFICALLY AND TO THE POINT OF

04:57:00.869 --> 04:57:02.838
THE ISSUES ON THE BROWN ACT. AND

04:57:02.905 --> 04:57:04.673
WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION AT THE

04:57:04.740 --> 04:57:07.242
PREVIOUS COMMITTEE. MY BILL

04:57:07.309 --> 04:57:09.244
SPECIFICALLY SAID THAT THAT

04:57:09.311 --> 04:57:11.613
THERE WAS A QUORUM HAD TO BE

04:57:11.680 --> 04:57:16.151
PRESENT IN AT THE LOCATION THAT

04:57:16.218 --> 04:57:19.388
THE CAMERA HAD TO BE ON IN ORDER

04:57:19.454 --> 04:57:21.190
TO PARTICIPATE, AND THAT A

04:57:21.256 --> 04:57:23.458
MEMBER OF THE BODY, THE

04:57:23.525 --> 04:57:24.826
LEGISLATIVE BODY, THERE WAS A

04:57:24.893 --> 04:57:26.662
LIMIT AS TO HOW MANY TIMES THAT

04:57:26.728 --> 04:57:29.531
THEY CAN ZOOM IN, IF YOU WILL,

04:57:29.598 --> 04:57:30.399
IF THAT'S THE PLATFORM WE'RE

04:57:30.465 --> 04:57:32.868
USING. SO THAT THERE WAS THE

04:57:32.935 --> 04:57:35.704
ABILITY FOR THE COMMUNITY TO

04:57:35.771 --> 04:57:37.906
FACE. YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE

04:57:37.973 --> 04:57:39.374
ISSUES FOR THE ACLU WAS THAT YOU

04:57:39.441 --> 04:57:41.276
COULDN'T AND I THINK THE

04:57:41.343 --> 04:57:42.044
NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS WAS THAT

04:57:42.110 --> 04:57:45.013
YOU YOU IF YOU ARE DOING IT

04:57:45.080 --> 04:57:46.448
VIRTUALLY, YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE

04:57:46.515 --> 04:57:47.182
OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT, AT, YOU

04:57:47.249 --> 04:57:49.351
KNOW, THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OR

04:57:49.418 --> 04:57:50.686
THE COUNCIL OR WHATEVER AGENCY

04:57:50.752 --> 04:57:52.588
WAS USING IT IN PERSON. BUT

04:57:52.654 --> 04:57:53.789
THAT'S WHY THERE WAS A LIMIT AS

04:57:53.855 --> 04:57:57.192
TO HOW MANY TIMES A MEMBER OF

04:57:57.259 --> 04:58:00.596
THAT BODY COULD USE THE REMOTE

04:58:00.662 --> 04:58:02.864
OPTION SO THAT THE COMMUNITY

04:58:02.931 --> 04:58:04.833
STILL HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO

04:58:04.900 --> 04:58:06.935
TALK TO THE MEMBERS PERSONALLY,

04:58:07.002 --> 04:58:10.672
BUT ALSO GIVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO

04:58:10.739 --> 04:58:12.674
THE AGENCIES TO BE ABLE TO DO

04:58:12.741 --> 04:58:15.978
THIS, TO HELP THOSE THAT WERE

04:58:16.044 --> 04:58:17.746
DISABLED OR IN THE RURAL

04:58:17.813 --> 04:58:19.581
COMMUNITIES WOULD HAVE TO DRIVE

04:58:19.648 --> 04:58:22.684
FAR AWAY. I KNOW THAT WE DID A

04:58:22.751 --> 04:58:24.786
LOT OF WORK ON IT, AND I KNOW

04:58:24.853 --> 04:58:25.687
THAT I'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION

04:58:25.754 --> 04:58:27.823
WITH THE SENATOR, SO I'M

04:58:27.889 --> 04:58:28.957
CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL ADDRESS

04:58:29.024 --> 04:58:30.826
THOSE ISSUES GOING FORWARD. I

04:58:30.892 --> 04:58:32.894
KNOW WE'RE ALL WAITING TO GO ON

04:58:32.961 --> 04:58:34.129
SUMMER BREAK, BUT I THINK

04:58:34.196 --> 04:58:35.931
THERE'S STILL SOME WORK THAT

04:58:35.998 --> 04:58:36.999
NEEDS TO BE DONE, ESPECIALLY

04:58:37.065 --> 04:58:38.500
BECAUSE ALL THOSE BILLS WERE

04:58:38.567 --> 04:58:39.835
MERGED. WE HAVE TO TAKE ALL OF

04:58:39.901 --> 04:58:41.837
THE COMPONENTS OF THOSE BILL,

04:58:41.903 --> 04:58:43.071
AND I DID BILLS. AND THE REASON

04:58:43.138 --> 04:58:45.040
THAT I AGREED TO MERGE THE BILL

04:58:45.107 --> 04:58:46.241
WAS BECAUSE I HAD THE COMMITMENT

04:58:46.308 --> 04:58:48.443
FROM THE SENATOR TO LOOK AT ALL

04:58:48.510 --> 04:58:49.378
OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE TALKING

04:58:49.444 --> 04:58:50.879
ABOUT. SO WITH THAT, I, YOU

04:58:50.946 --> 04:58:52.047
KNOW, I KNOW THAT THERE'S

04:58:52.114 --> 04:58:53.749
ISSUES, BUT I KNOW THAT THE WORK

04:58:53.815 --> 04:58:56.218
THAT I PUT INTO IT AND WE'VE PUT

04:58:56.285 --> 04:58:58.553
INTO IT, YOU KNOW, A FEW THREE

04:58:58.620 --> 04:58:59.321
YEARS AGO STILL IS THERE. AND

04:58:59.388 --> 04:59:01.490
I'M NOT GOING TO JUST LET IT GO

04:59:01.556 --> 04:59:03.525
BECAUSE, AGAIN, THE COMMITMENT

04:59:03.592 --> 04:59:04.960
FROM THE SENATOR WAS THAT IF WE

04:59:05.027 --> 04:59:06.895
MERGE THESE BILLS, WE WERE GOING

04:59:06.962 --> 04:59:09.231
TO FIND THAT THAT THAT, YOU

04:59:09.298 --> 04:59:11.033
KNOW, THE ISSUES AND ADDRESS

04:59:11.099 --> 04:59:13.101
THEM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY

04:59:13.168 --> 04:59:16.138
MUCH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WILSON.

04:59:16.204 --> 04:59:18.674
THANK YOU CHAIR. THANK YOU.

04:59:18.740 --> 04:59:20.042
SENATOR. I YOU KNOW, I

04:59:20.108 --> 04:59:21.176
UNDERSTAND THE DEFINITELY

04:59:21.243 --> 04:59:22.844
UNDERSTAND THE INTENT. AND AS MY

04:59:22.911 --> 04:59:25.781
COLLEAGUE NOTED, IT'S A

04:59:25.847 --> 04:59:27.616
COLLABORATION AND A AND A

04:59:27.683 --> 04:59:28.817
PARTNERSHIP. YOU KNOW, I'M NOT

04:59:28.884 --> 04:59:31.920
GOING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS

04:59:31.987 --> 04:59:35.524
TODAY, BUT I WANT THE NOTE THAT

04:59:35.590 --> 04:59:38.427
I THINK THE CONCERNS THAT WERE

04:59:38.493 --> 04:59:41.730
BROUGHT UP FROM OPPOSITION AND

04:59:41.797 --> 04:59:43.498
THE CIRCLE OF OPPOSITION PLUS

04:59:43.565 --> 04:59:44.900
OPPOSITION, IF I MAY OPPOSE

04:59:44.966 --> 04:59:46.435
UNLESS AMENDED OR SUPPORT IF

04:59:46.501 --> 04:59:47.269
AMENDED, HOWEVER YOU WANT TO

04:59:47.336 --> 04:59:49.237
LOOK AT IT, I THINK THEY'RE

04:59:49.304 --> 04:59:50.972
VALID. AND I THINK THAT, YOU

04:59:51.039 --> 04:59:53.075
KNOW, IT'S THERE'S A LOT OF

04:59:53.141 --> 04:59:54.876
BURDEN ON OUR CITIES AND

04:59:54.943 --> 04:59:57.279
COUNTIES TO DO THE RIGHT THING

04:59:57.346 --> 04:59:59.948
AND ENSURE THAT THEY'RE BEING

05:00:00.015 --> 05:00:01.783
TRANSPARENT AND PROVIDING AN

05:00:01.850 --> 05:00:03.151
ENVIRONMENT DURING THEIR PUBLIC

05:00:03.218 --> 05:00:04.886
MEETINGS WHERE THEY'RE FOSTERING

05:00:04.953 --> 05:00:09.091
CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AND NOT. THE

05:00:09.157 --> 05:00:10.192
OPPOSITE OF THAT, NOT TEARING IT

05:00:10.258 --> 05:00:11.927
DOWN. I ALSO THINK THAT THERE IS

05:00:11.993 --> 05:00:13.261
A DISTINCT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A

05:00:13.328 --> 05:00:15.764
CITY AND A COUNTY IN COMPARISON

05:00:15.831 --> 05:00:17.366
TO A SPECIAL DISTRICT. I THINK

05:00:17.432 --> 05:00:19.134
ABOUT SOME RECLAMATION DISTRICTS

05:00:19.201 --> 05:00:21.203
THAT HAVE A LARGE SWATH OF

05:00:21.269 --> 05:00:22.604
PEOPLE THAT ARE TECHNICALLY

05:00:22.671 --> 05:00:24.072
WITHIN THE DISTRICT. BUT, YOU

05:00:24.139 --> 05:00:26.274
KNOW, MY FIRST ONE OF MY FIRST

05:00:26.341 --> 05:00:28.110
JOBS IN, IN GOVERNMENT WAS BEING

05:00:28.176 --> 05:00:29.444
AN AUDITOR AND AUDITING THESE

05:00:29.511 --> 05:00:30.612
RECLAMATION DISTRICTS. THEY'RE

05:00:30.679 --> 05:00:32.147
SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND THEY DON'T

05:00:32.214 --> 05:00:33.849
HAVE MONEY, RIGHT? IT WAS WEIRD

05:00:33.915 --> 05:00:35.984
TO AUDIT THEM. AND SO I JUST

05:00:36.051 --> 05:00:37.686
THINK THE COST OF IT IS PRETTY

05:00:37.753 --> 05:00:39.121
GREAT. AND SO I THINK THAT THERE

05:00:39.187 --> 05:00:41.123
ARE CONCERNS THAT PEOPLE BROUGHT

05:00:41.189 --> 05:00:43.191
UP AND THIS NEED TO AS A PUBLIC,

05:00:43.258 --> 05:00:44.526
AS A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC, YOU

05:00:44.593 --> 05:00:46.828
HAVE A RIGHT TO SEE THE PERSON

05:00:46.895 --> 05:00:48.930
THAT YOU'VE ELECTED AND SEE THEM

05:00:48.997 --> 05:00:51.900
SERVING. AND SO IF YOU HAVE THIS

05:00:51.967 --> 05:00:53.235
COMPLETE EXEMPTION WHERE THEY

05:00:53.301 --> 05:00:56.705
NEVER HAVE TO SHOW UP AND PEOPLE

05:00:56.772 --> 05:00:57.906
CAN SAY, OH, WELL, YOU CAN GET

05:00:57.973 --> 05:01:00.242
THEM OUT IN FOUR YEARS, IT'S

05:01:00.308 --> 05:01:01.476
HARD TO GET SOMEONE OUT OF

05:01:01.543 --> 05:01:03.612
OFFICE. AND THEN COMING OUT OF

05:01:03.678 --> 05:01:05.414
OFFICE. I'VE SEEN THIS

05:01:05.480 --> 05:01:07.983
PARTICULAR PROVISION OR LEVEL OF

05:01:08.049 --> 05:01:10.185
ACCOMMODATION BE ABUSED

05:01:10.252 --> 05:01:11.620
FIRSTHAND. AND SO I'M JUST

05:01:11.686 --> 05:01:12.888
REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT ANYTHING

05:01:12.954 --> 05:01:14.623
WHERE WE WHOLESALE SAY SOMEBODY

05:01:14.689 --> 05:01:15.957
COULD DO THEIR WHOLE ENTIRE

05:01:16.024 --> 05:01:18.493
SERVICE REMOTELY OR VIRTUALLY.

05:01:18.560 --> 05:01:19.995
SO I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT

05:01:20.061 --> 05:01:21.329
TODAY. BUT I HOPE THAT, YOU

05:01:21.396 --> 05:01:22.664
KNOW, THOSE CONVERSATIONS

05:01:22.731 --> 05:01:24.232
CONTINUE. I TRUST YOU AS AN

05:01:24.299 --> 05:01:26.134
AUTHOR. I DEFINITELY TRUST MY

05:01:26.201 --> 05:01:27.169
COLLEAGUE AS AN AUTHOR, AND I

05:01:27.235 --> 05:01:29.171
KNOW YOU GUYS WILL GET THERE,

05:01:29.237 --> 05:01:30.672
BUT I THINK THAT THE CONCERNS

05:01:30.739 --> 05:01:31.273
BROUGHT UP BY OPPOSITION ARE

05:01:31.339 --> 05:01:33.542
VALID, AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL

05:01:33.608 --> 05:01:34.810
THEY WILL GIVE GREAT WEIGHT.

05:01:34.876 --> 05:01:35.377
THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER

05:01:35.444 --> 05:01:36.812
RANSOM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU

05:01:36.878 --> 05:01:39.881
CHAIR. SENATOR, THANK YOU FOR

05:01:39.948 --> 05:01:41.450
YOUR DRIVE TO MODERNIZE THE

05:01:41.516 --> 05:01:43.251
BROWN ACT. I DEFINITELY THINK

05:01:43.318 --> 05:01:44.853
THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. AND I

05:01:44.920 --> 05:01:45.687
STRONGLY APPRECIATE THE SPIRIT

05:01:45.754 --> 05:01:47.989
OF WHAT IT IS THAT YOU ARE

05:01:48.056 --> 05:01:49.791
SEEKING TO DO IN THIS BILL. WITH

05:01:49.858 --> 05:01:52.060
THAT SAID, THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT

05:01:52.127 --> 05:01:53.161
CONCERNS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN

05:01:53.228 --> 05:01:55.197
NOTED, AND I DO ALIGN MY

05:01:55.263 --> 05:01:56.698
THOUGHTS AND MY CONCERNS WITH

05:01:56.765 --> 05:01:59.067
BOTH THE ACLU AS WELL AS THE

05:01:59.134 --> 05:02:00.435
SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION.

05:02:00.502 --> 05:02:02.003
IN FACT, SOME SPECIAL DISTRICTS

05:02:02.070 --> 05:02:04.539
IN MY COMMUNITY WOULD BE GREATLY

05:02:04.606 --> 05:02:06.408
IMPACTED BY THIS. AND HAVING

05:02:06.475 --> 05:02:08.543
SERVED IN PUBLIC GOVERNMENT FOR

05:02:08.610 --> 05:02:10.245
13 YEARS AND AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

05:02:10.312 --> 05:02:12.814
ON THE DÍAS, IT'S DEFINITELY

05:02:12.881 --> 05:02:15.350
CONCERNING THAT WE WOULD PRETTY

05:02:15.417 --> 05:02:17.152
MUCH, YOU KNOW, GIVE FOLKS THE

05:02:17.219 --> 05:02:19.254
ABILITY TO NOT SERVE IN THE

05:02:19.321 --> 05:02:21.456
MANNER THAT THE COMMUNITY

05:02:21.523 --> 05:02:24.192
DESERVES MOST RECENTLY, AND WHAT

05:02:24.259 --> 05:02:26.528
I DON'T SEE ADDRESSED HERE, I DO

05:02:26.595 --> 05:02:28.997
SEE THAT WE LET ME BACK UP A

05:02:29.064 --> 05:02:30.298
LITTLE BIT. I DO SEE THAT WE

05:02:30.365 --> 05:02:31.833
HAVE ADDRESSED, YOU KNOW, ZOOM

05:02:31.900 --> 05:02:33.034
BOMBING AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

05:02:33.101 --> 05:02:34.669
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF

05:02:34.736 --> 05:02:35.570
YOU'VE ALSO THOUGHT ABOUT

05:02:35.637 --> 05:02:36.938
DISRUPT OTHER DISRUPTIONS. SO

05:02:37.005 --> 05:02:38.707
MOST RECENTLY IN THE CITY OF

05:02:38.773 --> 05:02:40.976
TRACY, WE HAD A COUNCIL MEETING,

05:02:41.042 --> 05:02:43.078
FOUR HOURS OF VIRTUAL TESTIMONY.

05:02:43.144 --> 05:02:44.980
AND SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY, WE

05:02:45.046 --> 05:02:47.449
FIGURED OUT THAT THE FOLKS WERE

05:02:47.516 --> 05:02:48.850
CALLED MULTIPLE. AND I KNOW THIS

05:02:48.917 --> 05:02:51.319
IS, YOU KNOW, ZOOM FACE TO FACE,

05:02:51.386 --> 05:02:52.821
BUT WE HAD PEOPLE THAT WERE NOT

05:02:52.888 --> 05:02:54.923
EVEN FROM THE COMMUNITY THAT

05:02:54.990 --> 05:02:56.758
WERE ENGAGED CALLING, YOU KNOW,

05:02:56.825 --> 05:02:59.394
FROM 75 MILES AWAY. AND WE WERE

05:02:59.461 --> 05:03:01.162
ABLE TO FIGURE THAT OUT. AND

05:03:01.229 --> 05:03:02.130
THEN PEOPLE TAKING MULTIPLE

05:03:02.197 --> 05:03:03.965
BITES AT THE APPLE TO ENGAGE. SO

05:03:04.032 --> 05:03:06.401
IT REALLY THEY HAD TO MAKE A

05:03:06.468 --> 05:03:07.168
DECISION IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

05:03:07.235 --> 05:03:10.071
MEETING TO BASICALLY VIOLATE

05:03:10.138 --> 05:03:11.940
PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE

05:03:12.007 --> 05:03:13.074
BECAUSE THEY WERE HEARING FROM

05:03:13.141 --> 05:03:14.643
THE SAME PEOPLE AND FROM PEOPLE

05:03:14.709 --> 05:03:15.810
THAT WEREN'T IN THE COMMUNITY.

05:03:15.877 --> 05:03:18.046
AND IT WAS FOUR HOURS ON ONE

05:03:18.113 --> 05:03:19.748
ITEM. AND SO I'M JUST WONDERING

05:03:19.814 --> 05:03:21.383
IF YOU'VE CONSIDERED, YOU KNOW,

05:03:21.449 --> 05:03:23.184
HOW WE'LL DEAL WITH THOSE OTHER

05:03:23.251 --> 05:03:24.486
THOSE. THAT'S NOT QUITE ZOOM

05:03:24.553 --> 05:03:26.588
BOMBING, BUT IT REALLY DOES

05:03:26.655 --> 05:03:28.790
IMPACT THE LOCAL COMMUNITY WHEN

05:03:28.857 --> 05:03:31.359
OTHER PEOPLE ARE, YOU KNOW, FOR

05:03:31.426 --> 05:03:32.193
THEIR OWN POLITICAL REASONS. AND

05:03:32.260 --> 05:03:34.529
THIS PARTICULAR CLIMATE, YOU

05:03:34.596 --> 05:03:35.997
KNOW, REALLY PULLING AWAY FROM

05:03:36.064 --> 05:03:38.233
THE COMMUNITY'S ABILITY TO GIVE

05:03:38.300 --> 05:03:39.234
INPUT BECAUSE THEY GOT TO GET

05:03:39.301 --> 05:03:40.769
BEHIND OTHER PEOPLE WHO DON'T

05:03:40.835 --> 05:03:42.404
HAVE GOOD, GOOD INTENTIONS. AND

05:03:42.470 --> 05:03:44.673
SO THERE ARE CONCERNS. BUT I DO

05:03:44.739 --> 05:03:46.775
REALLY APPRECIATE THAT YOU ARE

05:03:46.841 --> 05:03:48.944
WORKING WITH, YOU KNOW, OTHER

05:03:49.010 --> 05:03:50.078
COLLEAGUES, AND THE MEETING OF

05:03:50.145 --> 05:03:51.880
THE MINDS WILL BE ABLE TO

05:03:51.947 --> 05:03:53.315
STRAIGHTEN THIS OUT. AND I

05:03:53.381 --> 05:03:54.249
DEFINITELY APPRECIATE THAT YOU

05:03:54.316 --> 05:03:55.717
ARE WORKING WITH OPPOSITION TO

05:03:55.784 --> 05:03:56.885
MAKE THOSE AMENDMENTS. BUT I

05:03:56.952 --> 05:03:59.321
JUST WANTED TO BE CLEAR THAT I

05:03:59.387 --> 05:04:00.455
FEEL THAT THESE CONCERNS ARE

05:04:00.522 --> 05:04:03.425
VALID. AND SO THANK YOU SO MUCH

05:04:03.491 --> 05:04:05.427
FOR THE WORK THAT YOU DID DO.

05:04:05.493 --> 05:04:08.830
THANK YOU. SEEING NO ONE ELSE,

05:04:08.897 --> 05:04:11.833
DO YOU WANT TO ANSWER TO SOME OF

05:04:11.900 --> 05:04:14.970
THOSE QUESTIONS? IF YES, WE

05:04:15.036 --> 05:04:18.106
COULD RESPOND. I GUESS I'LL JUST

05:04:18.173 --> 05:04:19.207
START WITH THE MOST RECENT

05:04:19.274 --> 05:04:20.642
COMMENTS. YOU KNOW, THERE DOES

05:04:20.709 --> 05:04:22.777
EXIST IN THIS BILL THE ABILITY

05:04:22.844 --> 05:04:24.713
TO SET TIME LIMITS PER ITEM. AND

05:04:24.779 --> 05:04:26.881
THAT INCLUDES FOR IN-PERSON

05:04:26.948 --> 05:04:28.583
COMMENT AND REMOTE COMMENT. SO I

05:04:28.650 --> 05:04:30.018
BELIEVE THE REQUIREMENT IS THAT

05:04:30.085 --> 05:04:31.453
WHATEVER THOSE TIME LIMITS ARE

05:04:31.519 --> 05:04:33.922
SET AT, YOU HAVE TO ALLOW THAT

05:04:33.989 --> 05:04:35.090
AMOUNT OF TIME, REGARDLESS OF

05:04:35.156 --> 05:04:37.225
HOW MANY FOLKS SHOW UP AND

05:04:37.292 --> 05:04:38.159
ATTEND TO PROVIDE COMMENTS. SO

05:04:38.226 --> 05:04:40.362
IF YOU PROVIDE 25 MINUTES FOR A

05:04:40.428 --> 05:04:42.664
REMOTE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD,

05:04:42.731 --> 05:04:44.766
YOU CAN IF YOU HAVE, YOU KNOW,

05:04:44.833 --> 05:04:46.267
COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO ARE THERE

05:04:46.334 --> 05:04:48.103
GIVING COMMENT OVER AND OVER AND

05:04:48.169 --> 05:04:49.037
OVER AGAIN FOR THAT 25 MINUTES,

05:04:49.104 --> 05:04:51.973
YOU CAN CALL IT AT THAT TIME. OR

05:04:52.040 --> 05:04:53.108
IF NOBODY DOES SHOW UP, YOU HAVE

05:04:53.174 --> 05:04:54.676
TO KIND OF WAIT UNTIL THAT TIME

05:04:54.743 --> 05:04:56.011
PERIOD IS OVER. IT'S SIMILAR TO

05:04:56.077 --> 05:04:58.113
THE RULES THAT THE LEGISLATURE

05:04:58.179 --> 05:04:58.780
ABIDED BY DURING THE TIME WHEN

05:04:58.847 --> 05:05:00.248
YOU ALL ACCEPTED REMOTE PUBLIC

05:05:00.315 --> 05:05:02.117
COMMENT OVER THE PHONE, AND I

05:05:02.183 --> 05:05:04.719
ALSO WANT TO GO BACK AND ADDRESS

05:05:04.786 --> 05:05:05.987
THE COMMENTS BY SOME MEMBER,

05:05:06.054 --> 05:05:08.657
WILSON, AROUND THE ABILITY FOR

05:05:08.723 --> 05:05:11.860
FOLKS TO PARTICIPATE REMOTELY. I

05:05:11.926 --> 05:05:13.995
DID JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT

05:05:14.062 --> 05:05:15.764
THE FULL REMOTE FLEXIBILITY ONLY

05:05:15.830 --> 05:05:17.232
EXISTS FOR MEMBERS OF

05:05:17.298 --> 05:05:19.334
NON-DECISION MAKING ADVISORY

05:05:19.401 --> 05:05:21.136
BODIES. THERE IS AN EXCEPTION

05:05:21.202 --> 05:05:22.303
FOR MEMBERS WHO ARE ELECTED, WHO

05:05:22.370 --> 05:05:24.305
HAPPEN TO SERVE ON THOSE BODIES,

05:05:24.372 --> 05:05:26.675
AND THAT THE PROVISIONS IN THIS

05:05:26.741 --> 05:05:28.243
BILL REGARDING REMOTE

05:05:28.309 --> 05:05:29.310
PARTICIPATION FOR MEMBERS OF

05:05:29.377 --> 05:05:30.445
LEGISLATIVE BODIES, SO ELECTED

05:05:30.512 --> 05:05:32.347
CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS, BOARD OF

05:05:32.414 --> 05:05:34.115
SUPERVISORS, THAT IS AN

05:05:34.182 --> 05:05:36.685
EXTENSION OF CURRENT LAW. SO CAN

05:05:36.751 --> 05:05:38.720
I ASK A FOLLOW UP? IS THAT DOES

05:05:38.787 --> 05:05:42.691
THAT PLAY THE SAME? DOES THAT

05:05:42.757 --> 05:05:44.893
APPLY TO THE SAME NO MATTER

05:05:44.959 --> 05:05:45.960
DISABILITY? BECAUSE I THOUGHT I

05:05:46.027 --> 05:05:48.863
READ IN ONE SECTION TOO AROUND

05:05:48.930 --> 05:05:50.432
DISABILITY THAT IT DOES NOT. AND

05:05:50.498 --> 05:05:51.666
SO COULD YOU CLARIFY THROUGH THE

05:05:51.733 --> 05:05:53.902
CHAIR. SO THERE IS A PROVISION

05:05:53.968 --> 05:05:55.670
AROUND INDIVIDUALS WITH A

05:05:55.737 --> 05:05:57.472
DISABILITY THAT IS ACTUALLY A

05:05:57.539 --> 05:05:58.373
CODIFICATION OF AN OPINION

05:05:58.440 --> 05:05:59.607
RELEASED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

05:05:59.674 --> 05:06:01.843
LAST SUMMER THAT LOOKED AT THE

05:06:01.910 --> 05:06:03.344
QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT

05:06:03.411 --> 05:06:04.646
REMOTE MEETING PARTICIPATION

05:06:04.713 --> 05:06:06.481
AMONG THOSE WHO HAVE A

05:06:06.548 --> 05:06:08.583
DISABILITY IS A REASONABLE

05:06:08.650 --> 05:06:09.084
ACCOMMODATION UNDER THE

05:06:09.150 --> 05:06:10.185
AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT,

05:06:10.251 --> 05:06:11.920
AND BY REMOTE PARTICIPATION, TO

05:06:11.986 --> 05:06:13.455
BE MORE SPECIFIC, I MEAN NOT

05:06:13.521 --> 05:06:15.857
BEING REQUIRED TO POST AN AGENDA

05:06:15.924 --> 05:06:18.126
OUTSIDE OF THEIR HOME IF THAT'S

05:06:18.193 --> 05:06:18.693
WHERE THEY'RE PARTICIPATING

05:06:18.760 --> 05:06:19.561
FROM, AND THEN OPEN THE HOME,

05:06:19.627 --> 05:06:21.162
THEIR HOME TO THE PUBLIC. SO

05:06:21.229 --> 05:06:22.731
WHAT THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL

05:06:22.797 --> 05:06:24.499
DOES IS, IS TAKE THAT OPINION

05:06:24.566 --> 05:06:26.468
AND CODIFY IT. MY UNDERSTANDING

05:06:26.534 --> 05:06:27.736
IS, IS THAT OPINION KIND OF ON

05:06:27.802 --> 05:06:29.571
ITS OWN, HAD ESSENTIALLY THE

05:06:29.637 --> 05:06:32.073
SAME EFFECT AS AS BEING IN LAW

05:06:32.140 --> 05:06:33.808
AND WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND

05:06:33.875 --> 05:06:35.510
TRYING TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE

05:06:35.577 --> 05:06:37.512
SUITE OF LEGISLATION OVER THE

05:06:37.579 --> 05:06:39.280
YEARS, BROWN ACT ISSUES,

05:06:39.347 --> 05:06:42.517
INCLUDING THAT AG OPINION, IS AN

05:06:42.584 --> 05:06:43.118
ATTEMPT TO CODIFY THAT OPINION

05:06:43.184 --> 05:06:45.787
AND PUT IT INTO LAW. ONE LAST

05:06:45.854 --> 05:06:47.322
FOLLOW UP, IF YOU DON'T MIND.

05:06:47.388 --> 05:06:48.923
YES, OF COURSE, JUST ON THE

05:06:48.990 --> 05:06:51.126
PARTICULAR PART OF REMOTE IN

05:06:51.192 --> 05:06:52.927
PERPETUITY. THE AG'S OPINION DID

05:06:52.994 --> 05:06:55.463
NOT REFLECT IT, TALKED ABOUT

05:06:55.530 --> 05:06:56.865
ACCOMMODATION AND IT TALKED

05:06:56.931 --> 05:06:58.666
ABOUT UNDUE HARDSHIP. I JUST

05:06:58.733 --> 05:07:01.503
WANT TO BE CLEAR OUTSIDE OF THE

05:07:01.569 --> 05:07:02.537
AG OPINION, ARE YOU SAYING THAT

05:07:02.604 --> 05:07:05.573
THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL AS IT

05:07:05.640 --> 05:07:08.810
RELATES TO THE LIMITATIONS ON

05:07:08.877 --> 05:07:10.812
REMOTE PARTICIPATION OR THE

05:07:10.879 --> 05:07:15.650
NUMBER OF TIMES DO NOT APPLY TO

05:07:15.717 --> 05:07:19.721
THAT PARTICULAR GROUP OF THOSE

05:07:19.788 --> 05:07:21.356
IN A LEGISLATIVE DECISION MAKING

05:07:21.422 --> 05:07:22.957
BODY? WHO YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE

05:07:23.024 --> 05:07:24.225
AG GIVES THAT PERMISSION, NOT

05:07:24.292 --> 05:07:26.528
THE BILL. THIS BILL MIRRORS

05:07:26.594 --> 05:07:28.296
WHAT'S IN THE AG'S OPINION. WE

05:07:28.363 --> 05:07:29.831
HAVE BEEN CORRECTING A FEW KIND

05:07:29.898 --> 05:07:31.833
OF TINY ERRORS THAT DON'T

05:07:31.900 --> 05:07:33.234
COMPLETELY MATCH WHAT'S IN THE

05:07:33.301 --> 05:07:34.736
AG'S OPINION, BUT THE INTENT OF

05:07:34.803 --> 05:07:36.070
THAT LANGUAGE IS TO TAKE THE

05:07:36.137 --> 05:07:37.305
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OPINION FROM

05:07:37.372 --> 05:07:39.374
LAST YEAR AND SIMPLY CODIFY IT.

05:07:39.440 --> 05:07:41.109
SO I DON'T THINK HIS OPINION

05:07:41.176 --> 05:07:42.944
SAYS AG'S OPINION SAYS YOU COULD

05:07:43.011 --> 05:07:45.013
DO IT IN PERPETUITY, BUT I WILL

05:07:45.079 --> 05:07:46.848
BE HAPPY TO LOOK THAT UP. AND I

05:07:46.915 --> 05:07:48.483
LOOK FORWARD TO THE ADJUSTMENTS

05:07:48.550 --> 05:07:49.117
AND SEE WHETHER IT'S SOMETHING

05:07:49.184 --> 05:07:51.953
THAT I CAN SUPPORT ON THE FLOOR.

05:07:52.020 --> 05:07:52.821
MORE THAN THAT, I DON'T WANT

05:07:52.887 --> 05:07:54.656
PEOPLE TO THINK I'M JUST FOCUSED

05:07:54.722 --> 05:07:56.024
ON THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE. BUT I

05:07:56.090 --> 05:07:57.058
JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY, SINCE

05:07:57.125 --> 05:07:58.726
YOU HAD MADE THE COMMENT. BUT

05:07:58.793 --> 05:08:00.094
THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR. THANK

05:08:00.161 --> 05:08:01.296
YOU, SENATOR WILSON. SEEING NO

05:08:01.362 --> 05:08:02.864
ONE ELSE FROM THE COMMITTEE,

05:08:02.931 --> 05:08:03.398
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE,

05:08:03.464 --> 05:08:05.600
SENATOR? YES. I REALLY

05:08:05.667 --> 05:08:07.869
APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S HELP AND

05:08:07.936 --> 05:08:10.371
SUPPORT. THIS HAS BEEN VERY

05:08:10.438 --> 05:08:13.208
COMPLICATED TO TRY AND GET INTO

05:08:13.274 --> 05:08:15.109
THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. SHE'S

05:08:15.176 --> 05:08:17.145
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH IT. YOU HAVE

05:08:17.212 --> 05:08:20.048
A REALLY GOOD IDEA OF WHAT'S

05:08:20.114 --> 05:08:21.816
WHAT'S INVOLVED WITH THIS. AND I

05:08:21.883 --> 05:08:23.318
WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY WHO'S

05:08:23.384 --> 05:08:24.719
BEEN TRYING AND PUSHING AND

05:08:24.786 --> 05:08:27.155
PUSHING TO GET TO THAT, TO THAT

05:08:27.222 --> 05:08:28.723
RIGHT PLACE. WE'VE TRIED TO

05:08:28.790 --> 05:08:30.491
ADDRESS THE COST AND THE

05:08:30.558 --> 05:08:33.995
OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES, THE

05:08:34.062 --> 05:08:36.564
UNFUNDED MANDATE ISSUES, THE

05:08:36.631 --> 05:08:38.800
FIRST AMENDMENT, THE ABILITY AND

05:08:38.867 --> 05:08:40.902
THE RIGHT OF OUR DISABLED

05:08:40.969 --> 05:08:43.071
COMMUNITY TO PARTICIPATE.

05:08:43.137 --> 05:08:45.607
STUDENTS. IT'S BECOME VERY, VERY

05:08:45.673 --> 05:08:47.342
COMPLICATED. AND I WE WOULDN'T

05:08:47.408 --> 05:08:51.312
HAVE GOTTEN THIS FAR EVEN WITH

05:08:51.379 --> 05:08:52.847
OFFICIAL OPPOSITION. WE NEVER

05:08:52.914 --> 05:08:54.048
WOULD HAVE GOTTEN THIS FAR

05:08:54.115 --> 05:08:56.751
WITHOUT THE PARTICIPATION.

05:08:56.818 --> 05:08:59.053
DOZENS OF MEETINGS AND HOURS BY

05:08:59.120 --> 05:09:01.789
ALL OF THE FOLKS HERE. SO I WANT

05:09:01.856 --> 05:09:03.925
TO COMMIT TO YOU. I AM GOING TO

05:09:03.992 --> 05:09:05.793
CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT. I DON'T

05:09:05.860 --> 05:09:07.295
PUT NEARLY AS MANY HOURS AS THEY

05:09:07.362 --> 05:09:09.297
HAVE, BUT I'M PROUD TO WORK WITH

05:09:09.364 --> 05:09:10.465
THEM, AND WE'RE GOING TO

05:09:10.531 --> 05:09:12.333
CONTINUE TO WORK HARD TO GET TO

05:09:12.400 --> 05:09:14.035
WHERE THE BEST PLACE THAT WE

05:09:14.102 --> 05:09:16.104
CAN, BECAUSE WE CAN'T OTHERWISE.

05:09:16.170 --> 05:09:21.609
WE END UP WITH. WE END UP LOSING

05:09:21.676 --> 05:09:23.378
WHAT THE PROGRESS THAT WAS MADE.

05:09:23.444 --> 05:09:25.914

INFRASTRUCTURE WAS ALSO DAMAGED,

05:14:25.346 --> 05:14:26.714
POTENTIALLY DELAYING REBUILDING

05:14:26.781 --> 05:14:28.916
AND RECOVERY EFFORTS. THIS BILL

05:14:28.983 --> 05:14:30.785
WOULD ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS,

05:14:30.851 --> 05:14:33.254
INCLUDING LOS ANGELES COUNTY, TO

05:14:33.321 --> 05:14:34.655
ACCESS THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

05:14:34.722 --> 05:14:36.557
TOOLS OF FINANCING DISTRICTS TO

05:14:36.624 --> 05:14:38.626
ASSIST IN THE REBUILDING OF

05:14:38.693 --> 05:14:39.694
INFRASTRUCTURE AND SUPPORT

05:14:39.760 --> 05:14:42.630
ECONOMIC RECOVERY. SB 782 MAKES

05:14:42.697 --> 05:14:44.098
MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO THE

05:14:44.165 --> 05:14:45.967
EXISTING FINANCING DISTRICTS TO

05:14:46.033 --> 05:14:48.035
ALLOW THESE TOOLS TO BE QUICKLY

05:14:48.102 --> 05:14:49.837
IMPLEMENTED FOLLOWING MAJOR

05:14:49.904 --> 05:14:51.172
DISASTERS, AND PROVIDE SOME

05:14:51.239 --> 05:14:52.673
FLEXIBILITY IN THE TYPE OF

05:14:52.740 --> 05:14:54.842
PROJECTS ELIGIBLE FOR FUNDING.

05:14:54.909 --> 05:14:57.745
DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED UNDER SB

05:14:57.812 --> 05:14:59.213
782 COULD USE FUTURE TAX

05:14:59.280 --> 05:15:00.982
INCREMENT REVENUES TO SUPPORT

05:15:01.048 --> 05:15:02.550
RECONSTRUCTION OF ROADS, WATER

05:15:02.617 --> 05:15:04.452
AND SEWER LINES, GOVERNMENT

05:15:04.518 --> 05:15:06.254
STRUCTURES, PARKS, LIBRARIES,

05:15:06.320 --> 05:15:08.122
HOUSING AND COMMERCIAL AREAS.

05:15:08.189 --> 05:15:09.657
THE BILL ALSO ALLOWS FOR

05:15:09.724 --> 05:15:11.359
SUPPORTIVE PROGRAMS LIKE LOW

05:15:11.425 --> 05:15:13.261
INTEREST CONSTRUCTION, LOANS FOR

05:15:13.327 --> 05:15:15.396
DISPLACED RESIDENTS AND SMALL

05:15:15.463 --> 05:15:16.931
BUSINESSES, AND INVESTMENTS IN

05:15:16.998 --> 05:15:18.199
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND JOB

05:15:18.266 --> 05:15:19.667
TRAINING, ALL OF WHICH ARE

05:15:19.734 --> 05:15:21.135
ESSENTIAL TO A FULL AND

05:15:21.202 --> 05:15:23.604
EQUITABLE RECOVERY. TOGETHER,

05:15:23.671 --> 05:15:25.039
THESE PROPOSALS WOULD HELP THE

05:15:25.106 --> 05:15:26.374
COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES AND OTHER

05:15:26.440 --> 05:15:28.042
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACCELERATE

05:15:28.109 --> 05:15:29.143
RECOVERY NOT ONLY FROM THIS

05:15:29.210 --> 05:15:30.811
YEAR'S WILDFIRES, BUT FROM

05:15:30.878 --> 05:15:33.147
FUTURE DISASTERS AS WELL. FOR

05:15:33.214 --> 05:15:34.715
THOSE REASONS, WE RESPECTFULLY

05:15:34.782 --> 05:15:37.718
URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB 782.

05:15:37.785 --> 05:15:40.288
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. ARE THERE

05:15:40.354 --> 05:15:41.956
ARE ANY OTHER MEMBERS IN THE

05:15:42.023 --> 05:15:45.159
AUDIENCE WHO WISH TO ADD ON IN

05:15:45.226 --> 05:15:47.295
SUPPORT? PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME,

05:15:47.361 --> 05:15:51.065
ORGANIZATION AND POSITION. MADAM

05:15:51.132 --> 05:15:52.199
CHAIR MEMBERS ANDREW ANTOHI WITH

05:15:52.266 --> 05:15:53.901
CHAU, YODER, SCHMELZER AND LANG

05:15:53.968 --> 05:15:56.604
HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CITY

05:15:56.671 --> 05:15:59.206
OF LOS ANGELES IN SUPPORT. THANK

05:15:59.273 --> 05:16:01.909
YOU. ANY MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE

05:16:01.976 --> 05:16:14.755
IN OPPOSITION.

05:16:14.822 --> 05:16:16.223
THANK YOU. COMMITTEE AND

05:16:16.290 --> 05:16:17.992
MEMBERS. MY NAME IS MICHAEL

05:16:18.059 --> 05:16:20.494
SEAMAN. I'M THE CHAIR OF

05:16:20.561 --> 05:16:22.963
CALIFORNIA UNINCORPORATED. I'M

05:16:23.030 --> 05:16:26.233
HERE SPEAKING FOR TWO ALTADENA

05:16:26.300 --> 05:16:28.469
RESIDENTS WHO CAME HERE AT THEIR

05:16:28.536 --> 05:16:29.603
OWN EXPENSE AND HAD NO CHOICE

05:16:29.670 --> 05:16:31.772
BUT TO LEAVE FOR THE AIRPORT. WE

05:16:31.839 --> 05:16:33.808
ALL KNOW WHAT A HECTIC DAY

05:16:33.874 --> 05:16:35.142
EVERYBODY'S HAD, SO I HOPE

05:16:35.209 --> 05:16:36.177
THAT'S UNDERSTOOD. I'M GOING TO

05:16:36.243 --> 05:16:37.611
BE SUMMARIZING THEIR COMMENTS

05:16:37.678 --> 05:16:38.813
THAT SUPPLEMENT THE WRITTEN

05:16:38.879 --> 05:16:40.214
INPUT THAT YOU'VE ALREADY

05:16:40.281 --> 05:16:42.750
RECEIVED. CALIFORNIA

05:16:42.817 --> 05:16:45.252
UNINCORPORATED SPEAKS FOR 5 TO 6

05:16:45.319 --> 05:16:46.387
MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO DO NOT

05:16:46.454 --> 05:16:47.755
HAVE MAYORS AND CITY COUNCILS TO

05:16:47.822 --> 05:16:50.858
LOOK OUT FOR LOCAL INTERESTS.

05:16:50.925 --> 05:16:53.694
ALTADENA PARTICIPATES WITH US.

05:16:53.761 --> 05:16:55.062
CALIFORNIA UNINCORPORATED

05:16:55.129 --> 05:16:57.865
SUPPORTS ALTADENA AND OPPOSES

05:16:57.932 --> 05:17:01.369
BOTH SB 782 AND SB 549 THAT I

05:17:01.435 --> 05:17:03.771
KNOW YOU'VE ALREADY TAKEN UNDER

05:17:03.838 --> 05:17:05.873
CONSIDERATION. OUR ORGANIZATION

05:17:05.940 --> 05:17:07.641
BELIEVES IN LOCAL CONTROL, AND

05:17:07.708 --> 05:17:09.510
THAT'S SOMETHING ALTADENA DOES

05:17:09.577 --> 05:17:12.012
NOT HAVE BUT DESERVES. THE

05:17:12.079 --> 05:17:13.848
PEOPLE OF ALTADENA WANT TO BE

05:17:13.914 --> 05:17:15.082
LISTENED TO, AND THEY DESERVE TO

05:17:15.149 --> 05:17:17.318
HAVE CONTROL AND A SAY OVER

05:17:17.385 --> 05:17:18.886
SWEEPING, LIFE CHANGING

05:17:18.953 --> 05:17:20.988
DECISIONS. THEY WERE CUT OUT OF

05:17:21.055 --> 05:17:22.356
THE DISCUSSIONS THAT LED TO THIS

05:17:22.423 --> 05:17:25.593
BILL, AND EVENTUALLY YOUR

05:17:25.659 --> 05:17:27.128
COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION.

05:17:27.194 --> 05:17:28.996
THEY'RE STRONGLY OPPOSED TO THIS

05:17:29.063 --> 05:17:31.132
BILL. IF IT WERE POSSIBLE, YOU

05:17:31.198 --> 05:17:33.667
WOULD ALSO SEE A VERY LONG ME

05:17:33.734 --> 05:17:37.204
TOO LINE OF LOCAL PEOPLE FROM

05:17:37.271 --> 05:17:40.441
ALTADENA IN OPPOSITION, THE

05:17:40.508 --> 05:17:42.276
PEOPLE OF ALTADENA SUPPORT

05:17:42.343 --> 05:17:47.648
ASSEMBLY BILL 797. INSTEAD, THEY

05:17:47.715 --> 05:17:51.685
OPPOSE SEVEN SB 782 BECAUSE IT

05:17:51.752 --> 05:17:53.387
GIVES LA COUNTY EVEN MORE POWER

05:17:53.454 --> 05:17:55.623
OVER THEIR RECOVERY WHEN THEY

05:17:55.689 --> 05:17:57.691
FEEL THAT THE COUNTY HAS ALREADY

05:17:57.758 --> 05:18:00.161
FAILED THEM TIME AND TIME AGAIN,

05:18:00.227 --> 05:18:02.763
THEY FEEL THE COUNTY OFFERED NO

05:18:02.830 --> 05:18:04.064
TRANSPARENCY, NO ACCOUNTABILITY,

05:18:04.131 --> 05:18:05.833
AND NO SUPPORT THAT REFLECTS THE

05:18:05.900 --> 05:18:08.169
SCALE OF THE DISASTER. THEY WANT

05:18:08.235 --> 05:18:10.237
THE REBUILD AND RECOVERY TO BE

05:18:10.304 --> 05:18:12.072
COMMUNITY LED, NOT COUNTY

05:18:12.139 --> 05:18:14.608
IMPOSED. ALTADENA HAS LONG

05:18:14.675 --> 05:18:16.010
DESERVED A SEAT AT THE TABLE,

05:18:16.076 --> 05:18:18.579
BUT MORE SO THEY WANT THEIR OWN

05:18:18.646 --> 05:18:21.515
TABLE. THE CORRECT ANSWER IS FOR

05:18:21.582 --> 05:18:23.551
ALTADENA TO BE AN INCORPORATED

05:18:23.617 --> 05:18:25.352
MUNICIPALITY LIKE PASADENA OR

05:18:25.419 --> 05:18:27.922
SIERRA MADRE. IF ALTADENA WAS A

05:18:27.988 --> 05:18:29.457
CITY, WE WOULD NOT NEED TO BE

05:18:29.523 --> 05:18:31.992
HERE DISCUSSING THESE BILLS. THE

05:18:32.059 --> 05:18:33.627
STATE NEEDS TO EMPOWER

05:18:33.694 --> 05:18:34.795
UNINCORPORATED COMMUNITIES TO

05:18:34.862 --> 05:18:36.597
HAVE THEIR OWN MAYORS AND CITY

05:18:36.664 --> 05:18:38.666
COUNCILS, AND THE LAFCO LAW

05:18:38.732 --> 05:18:40.534
NEEDS TO BE REFORMED, AND

05:18:40.601 --> 05:18:41.302
HOPEFULLY YOUR COMMITTEE WILL

05:18:41.368 --> 05:18:43.103
TAKE THAT UP SOMETIME IN THE

05:18:43.170 --> 05:18:45.005
FUTURE. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR

05:18:45.072 --> 05:18:47.441
YOUR COMMITTEE TO NOT MOVE THIS

05:18:47.508 --> 05:18:49.343
BILL FORWARD. THANK YOU. THANK

05:18:49.410 --> 05:18:50.978
YOU FOR THAT. ANYBODY ELSE THAT

05:18:51.045 --> 05:18:52.446
WANTS TO ADD ON IN OPPOSITION IN

05:18:52.513 --> 05:18:56.517
THE ROOM, SEEING NONE. COMMITTEE

05:18:56.584 --> 05:19:00.721
MEMBERS. QUESTIONS? COMMENTS.

05:19:00.788 --> 05:19:02.890
HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND.

05:19:02.957 --> 05:19:04.825
SENATOR PEREZ, WOULD YOU LIKE TO

05:19:04.892 --> 05:19:06.827
CLOSE? YES, CERTAINLY. WELL,

05:19:06.894 --> 05:19:08.929
FIRST I WANT TO JUST ACKNOWLEDGE

05:19:08.996 --> 05:19:11.932
AND APPRECIATE THE GENTLEMAN WHO

05:19:11.999 --> 05:19:14.401
IS HERE IN OPPOSITION. I'VE BEEN

05:19:14.468 --> 05:19:16.504
VERY HIGHLY ENGAGED WITH MY

05:19:16.570 --> 05:19:18.138
RESIDENTS. I MEAN, I THINK THAT

05:19:18.205 --> 05:19:18.839
THEY WILL TELL YOU THAT

05:19:18.906 --> 05:19:20.641
THEMSELVES. AND HE DIDN'T NAME

05:19:20.708 --> 05:19:22.009
NAMES, BUT I CAN PROBABLY GUESS

05:19:22.076 --> 05:19:23.811
WHO HE'S SPEAKING TO. AND HE

05:19:23.878 --> 05:19:24.945
MENTIONS THE TWO ALTADENA

05:19:25.012 --> 05:19:25.846
RESIDENTS THAT HAVE RAISED

05:19:25.913 --> 05:19:28.249
CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL. YOU

05:19:28.315 --> 05:19:30.618
KNOW, I THINK ONE OF THE PRIMARY

05:19:30.684 --> 05:19:32.453
CONCERNS THAT IS PROBABLY THE

05:19:32.520 --> 05:19:34.088
REASON WHY THIS GENTLEMAN IS

05:19:34.154 --> 05:19:35.422
HERE TODAY IS THERE ARE A NUMBER

05:19:35.489 --> 05:19:37.391
OF RESIDENTS THAT ARE VERY

05:19:37.458 --> 05:19:39.660
INTERESTED IN ALTADENA'S

05:19:39.727 --> 05:19:41.061
INCORPORATION AS A CITY, AND

05:19:41.128 --> 05:19:42.796
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS A HUGE

05:19:42.863 --> 05:19:45.299
PRIORITY TO THEM. AND I'VE HEARD

05:19:45.366 --> 05:19:47.635
THAT FROM SEVERAL RESIDENTS THAT

05:19:47.701 --> 05:19:49.203
ARE TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD IN

05:19:49.270 --> 05:19:50.905
THAT EFFORT. OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S A

05:19:50.971 --> 05:19:52.306
VERY DIFFERENT PROCESS THAT GOES

05:19:52.373 --> 05:19:54.408
THROUGH LAFCO, AND THEY WANT TO

05:19:54.475 --> 05:19:56.110
MAKE SURE THAT THIS BILL DOES

05:19:56.176 --> 05:19:57.244
NOT IMPEDE IN THAT. THOSE ARE

05:19:57.311 --> 05:19:58.612
ACTIVE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE'VE

05:19:58.679 --> 05:20:00.447
HAD WITH FLEDGED COUNCIL. YOU

05:20:00.514 --> 05:20:01.949
KNOW, I WILL TELL YOU, WE'VE NOT

05:20:02.016 --> 05:20:04.385
BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY CASE WHERE

05:20:04.451 --> 05:20:06.086
AN INCREMENT FINANCING DISTRICT

05:20:06.153 --> 05:20:08.455
WAS USED TO THWART THE

05:20:08.522 --> 05:20:10.524
INCORPORATION OF A CITY. AND WE

05:20:10.591 --> 05:20:12.793
ARE ALSO HAVING CONVERSATIONS

05:20:12.860 --> 05:20:14.361
ABOUT WHAT WE COULD BETTER DO TO

05:20:14.428 --> 05:20:16.330
GET AN ANSWER, PARTICULARLY TO

05:20:16.397 --> 05:20:18.465
THOSE CONCERNS, BECAUSE THIS IS

05:20:18.532 --> 05:20:22.002
NOT MEANT TO IMPEDE UPON

05:20:22.069 --> 05:20:23.537
RESIDENTS INCORPORATING AS A

05:20:23.604 --> 05:20:25.506
CITY IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO MOVE

05:20:25.573 --> 05:20:26.440
THAT DIRECTION. THAT IS

05:20:26.507 --> 05:20:27.107
OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING THAT WILL BE

05:20:27.174 --> 05:20:28.842
UP TO THE CONSTITUENTS OF

05:20:28.909 --> 05:20:30.110
ALTADENA. AND AS SOMEBODY THAT

05:20:30.177 --> 05:20:32.880
WAS A LOCAL MAYOR MYSELF, I

05:20:32.947 --> 05:20:35.049
UNDERSTAND THAT DESIRE FOR LOCAL

05:20:35.115 --> 05:20:37.284
CONTROL. IN ADDITION TO THAT,

05:20:37.351 --> 05:20:38.919
SOME OTHER CONCERNS THAT WE'VE

05:20:38.986 --> 05:20:40.854
HEARD ARE AROUND ENSURING THAT

05:20:40.921 --> 05:20:42.990
WE HAVE A PUBLIC PARTICIPATION

05:20:43.057 --> 05:20:44.391
PROCESS AND WHAT THAT WILL LOOK

05:20:44.458 --> 05:20:46.594
LIKE AS THESE FUNDS ARE BEING

05:20:46.660 --> 05:20:48.329
ALLOCATED. WE DO HAVE A PUBLIC

05:20:48.395 --> 05:20:49.797
HEARING PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN

05:20:49.863 --> 05:20:51.565
BUILT SPECIFICALLY INTO THIS

05:20:51.632 --> 05:20:54.568
BILL AND TO SB 782. I DO WANT TO

05:20:54.635 --> 05:20:56.236
HIGHLIGHT THERE IS NO PUBLIC

05:20:56.303 --> 05:20:59.573
HEARING PROCESS FOR AB 797. AB

05:20:59.640 --> 05:21:02.042
797 ALSO UTILIZES CRA MONEY,

05:21:02.109 --> 05:21:03.444
WHICH IS EXCELLENT. THOSE ARE

05:21:03.510 --> 05:21:06.347
FEDERAL FUNDS. AND AS ASSEMBLY

05:21:06.413 --> 05:21:07.448
MEMBER JOHN GARABEDIAN IS

05:21:07.514 --> 05:21:09.083
CARRYING THAT BILL, I DO THINK

05:21:09.149 --> 05:21:10.751
THAT IT ALSO SERVES ITS OWN

05:21:10.818 --> 05:21:11.885
PURPOSE. THESE ARE BOTH THINGS

05:21:11.952 --> 05:21:14.021
THAT WE WANT TO SEE ENACTED. THE

05:21:14.088 --> 05:21:15.789
ASSEMBLY MEMBER KNOWS THAT I'M

05:21:15.856 --> 05:21:18.292
VERY SUPPORTIVE, BUT BECAUSE SB

05:21:18.359 --> 05:21:20.394
782 WOULD BE DEALING WITH

05:21:20.461 --> 05:21:22.296
PROPERTY TAX REVENUE, THERE WILL

05:21:22.363 --> 05:21:24.331
BE A PUBLIC PROCESS. THERE WILL

05:21:24.398 --> 05:21:25.799
BE A BOARD THAT WILL BE

05:21:25.866 --> 05:21:26.834
ESTABLISHED. THERE WILL BE

05:21:26.900 --> 05:21:27.935
INDIVIDUALS THAT WILL BE

05:21:28.002 --> 05:21:29.436
APPOINTED TO THAT BOARD. WE'VE

05:21:29.503 --> 05:21:31.839
HEARD DIRECTLY FROM CONSTITUENTS

05:21:31.905 --> 05:21:33.507
ABOUT WHAT THAT WILL LOOK LIKE

05:21:33.574 --> 05:21:35.009
AND HOW THEY'LL BE ABLE TO

05:21:35.075 --> 05:21:36.610
PARTICIPATE IN THAT PROCESS AND

05:21:36.677 --> 05:21:38.545
EVEN BE MEMBERS OF THAT BOARD.

05:21:38.612 --> 05:21:40.147
I'VE TALKED WITH THE COUNTY

05:21:40.214 --> 05:21:41.749
ABOUT THAT. THEY'RE VERY OPEN TO

05:21:41.815 --> 05:21:43.250
US, MAKING IT VERY EXPLICIT.

05:21:43.317 --> 05:21:44.451
THEY WANT TO SEE THAT LANGUAGE

05:21:44.518 --> 05:21:47.421
BE VERY EXPLICIT. SO I RECOGNIZE

05:21:47.488 --> 05:21:48.756
THAT THERE'S A LOT OF FEELINGS

05:21:48.822 --> 05:21:50.591
RIGHT NOW IN THE COMMUNITY

05:21:50.658 --> 05:21:51.892
BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED DURING

05:21:51.959 --> 05:21:54.294
THE DISASTER. THERE WERE DELAYS

05:21:54.361 --> 05:21:56.063
IN RESPONSE TIMES THAT WERE VERY

05:21:56.130 --> 05:21:58.599
DIFFERENT FROM THE PALISADES.

05:21:58.666 --> 05:22:00.701
AND FORTUNATELY, I HAVE TALKED

05:22:00.768 --> 05:22:01.902
TO RESIDENTS WHO DID NOT GET AN

05:22:01.969 --> 05:22:03.337
ALERT TO EVACUATE UNTIL 3:00 IN

05:22:03.404 --> 05:22:05.339
THE MORNING. THAT WAS ALMOST

05:22:05.406 --> 05:22:06.840
FIVE HOURS AFTER THE FIRE HAS

05:22:06.907 --> 05:22:08.642
BEGUN. AND SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND

05:22:08.709 --> 05:22:10.377
FEELINGS ARE VERY RAW, AND I

05:22:10.444 --> 05:22:11.879
RECOGNIZE THAT. AND I'VE

05:22:11.945 --> 05:22:13.714
COMMUNICATED THAT TO OUR COUNTY

05:22:13.781 --> 05:22:15.082
PARTNERS. THEY RECOGNIZE THAT AS

05:22:15.149 --> 05:22:16.483
WELL. SO WE WANT TO BE REALLY

05:22:16.550 --> 05:22:19.386
INTENTIONAL HERE. SO HEAR THE

05:22:19.453 --> 05:22:21.288
FEEDBACK. YOU KNOW, AND WANT TO

05:22:21.355 --> 05:22:22.623
RECOGNIZE THAT AS RESIDENTS IN

05:22:22.690 --> 05:22:24.525

05:22:24.591 --> 05:22:25.959

GOOD AFTERNOON, MR. CHAIR. AND

05:23:43.670 --> 05:23:45.472
827, WHICH WILL UPDATE EXISTING

05:23:45.539 --> 05:23:46.974
ETHICS TRAINING REQUIREMENTS AND

05:23:47.040 --> 05:23:48.008
REQUIRE LOCAL OFFICIALS TO

05:23:48.075 --> 05:23:49.443
COMPLETE FISCAL AND FINANCIAL

05:23:49.510 --> 05:23:52.012
TRAINING. IN RECENT AUDIT

05:23:52.079 --> 05:23:52.913
RECOMMENDATIONS, THE CALIFORNIA

05:23:52.980 --> 05:23:55.516
STATE AUDITOR HAS REPEATEDLY

05:23:55.582 --> 05:23:56.216
RECOMMENDED THAT LOCAL

05:23:56.283 --> 05:23:57.718
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS RECEIVE

05:23:57.785 --> 05:23:59.553
TRAINING ON THEIR FISCAL AND

05:23:59.620 --> 05:24:01.021
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT DUTIES. AND

05:24:01.088 --> 05:24:02.122
AS I KNOW FROM BEING A LONG

05:24:02.189 --> 05:24:03.824
BEACH CITY COUNCIL MEMBER, LOCAL

05:24:03.891 --> 05:24:05.292
OFFICIALS ARE ENTRUSTED WITH

05:24:05.359 --> 05:24:07.427
TAXPAYER MONEY AND HAVE MORE

05:24:07.494 --> 05:24:09.196
DIRECT AUTHORITY OVER BUDGETING,

05:24:09.263 --> 05:24:10.597
PROCUREMENT, MANAGEMENT AND

05:24:10.664 --> 05:24:11.598
INVESTMENTS AND PENSIONS. YET

05:24:11.665 --> 05:24:13.567
THERE ARE NO REQUIREMENTS THAT

05:24:13.634 --> 05:24:14.701
THESE OFFICIALS RECEIVE ANY

05:24:14.768 --> 05:24:16.336
TRAINING ON BEST PRACTICES OR

05:24:16.403 --> 05:24:18.205
HOW TO MANAGE THESE SUBSTANTIAL

05:24:18.272 --> 05:24:20.040
FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES. IN

05:24:20.107 --> 05:24:21.809
2023, I ACTUALLY AUTHORED A

05:24:21.875 --> 05:24:23.911
SIMILAR BILL IN WHICH MANY, MANY

05:24:23.977 --> 05:24:25.045
MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE

05:24:25.112 --> 05:24:29.349
SUPPORTED, WHICH WAS SB 769, AND

05:24:29.416 --> 05:24:30.818
AS A STATE LEGISLATOR, I WOULD

05:24:30.884 --> 05:24:32.119
JUST TELL YOU, THE REASON WHY I

05:24:32.186 --> 05:24:33.854
BROUGHT THIS FORWARD WAS BECAUSE

05:24:33.921 --> 05:24:35.956
A LOT OF MY CITIES, I HAVE ABOUT

05:24:36.023 --> 05:24:37.024
NINE SOUTHEAST LOS ANGELES

05:24:37.090 --> 05:24:38.358
CITIES THAT HAVE HAD REAL

05:24:38.425 --> 05:24:39.293
TROUBLE OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS

05:24:39.359 --> 05:24:41.094
THAT I'VE BEEN AN ELECTED

05:24:41.161 --> 05:24:42.729
OFFICIAL HERE IN THE STATE WITH

05:24:42.796 --> 05:24:44.097
CORRUPTION, WHETHER IT'S

05:24:44.164 --> 05:24:45.632
QUESTIONABLE CONTRACTING,

05:24:45.699 --> 05:24:47.234
WHETHER IT IS A POOL THAT WAS

05:24:47.301 --> 05:24:49.503
NEVER BUILT IN HUNTINGTON PARK,

05:24:49.570 --> 05:24:52.472
WHETHER IT WAS JUST HAVING SOME

05:24:52.539 --> 05:24:53.640
IN SOME CASES, CITY MANAGERS

05:24:53.707 --> 05:24:55.709
THAT DON'T HAVE ANY FINANCIAL

05:24:55.776 --> 05:24:57.611
BACKGROUND OR EXPERIENCE. AND SO

05:24:57.678 --> 05:24:59.479
WE DO NEED TO DO MORE AND ENSURE

05:24:59.546 --> 05:25:01.081
THAT WE'RE NOT ERODING PUBLIC

05:25:01.148 --> 05:25:03.383
TRUST AND UPLIFT AS MUCH AS WE

05:25:03.450 --> 05:25:06.753
CAN WITH THIS TRAINING AND

05:25:06.820 --> 05:25:08.622
ADDITIONAL ETHICS REQUIREMENTS

05:25:08.689 --> 05:25:10.190
FOR CITY MANAGERS AND CITY

05:25:10.257 --> 05:25:11.124
ATTORNEYS THAT SHOULD BE DOING

05:25:11.191 --> 05:25:13.327
THIS AS WELL. WITH THAT, I HAVE

05:25:13.393 --> 05:25:15.162
TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. I HAVE

05:25:15.229 --> 05:25:17.664

HOCHMAN, WHO I'VE ALSO SPOKE TO

05:25:26.340 --> 05:25:29.610
AND IS IN SUPPORT AS WELL. CHAIR

05:25:31.078 --> 05:25:32.346
HOOD, ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA

05:25:32.412 --> 05:25:33.814
COMMON CAUSE, TODAY, WE'RE

05:25:33.881 --> 05:25:36.350
PLEASED TO SUPPORT SB 827, WHICH

05:25:36.416 --> 05:25:37.885
STRENGTHENS STRENGTHENS

05:25:37.951 --> 05:25:39.186
TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY AND

05:25:39.253 --> 05:25:41.088
FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY IN LOCAL

05:25:41.154 --> 05:25:42.856
GOVERNMENT BY ENHANCING ETHICS

05:25:42.923 --> 05:25:43.957
TRAINING AND ADDING A NEW

05:25:44.024 --> 05:25:45.392
REQUIREMENT FOR FINANCIAL

05:25:45.459 --> 05:25:47.527
TRAINING. CALIFORNIA RIGHTLY

05:25:47.594 --> 05:25:49.296
EXPECTS PUBLIC OFFICIALS TO ACT

05:25:49.363 --> 05:25:50.731
WITH INTEGRITY AND FISCAL

05:25:50.797 --> 05:25:53.000
PRUDENCE. YET TOO OFTEN, FISCAL

05:25:53.066 --> 05:25:54.034
MISMANAGEMENT GOES UNCHECKED DUE

05:25:54.101 --> 05:25:56.036
TO A LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OR

05:25:56.103 --> 05:25:57.237
EXPERIENCE AMONG DECISION

05:25:57.304 --> 05:26:00.841
MAKERS. SB 827 FILLS THIS GAP BY

05:26:00.908 --> 05:26:02.643
REQUIRING LOCAL LEGISLATORS,

05:26:02.709 --> 05:26:04.444
DEPARTMENT HEADS, AND DESIGNATED

05:26:04.511 --> 05:26:06.546
OFFICIALS TO COMPLETE BIANNUAL

05:26:06.613 --> 05:26:08.115
TRAINING IN PUBLIC FINANCE. THIS

05:26:08.181 --> 05:26:09.583
IS A PRACTICAL STEP TOWARD

05:26:09.650 --> 05:26:11.351
BETTER OVERSIGHT AND MORE

05:26:11.418 --> 05:26:12.719
EFFECTIVE USE OF TAXPAYER

05:26:12.786 --> 05:26:15.222
DOLLARS. WE RECOGNIZE THAT NO

05:26:15.289 --> 05:26:15.822
TRAINING WILL ELIMINATE

05:26:15.889 --> 05:26:17.357
CORRUPTION WHERE IT'S DEEPLY

05:26:17.424 --> 05:26:20.627
ROOTED, BUT SB 827 CAN EQUIP

05:26:20.694 --> 05:26:21.528
WELL-INTENTIONED PUBLIC SERVANTS

05:26:21.595 --> 05:26:22.763
WITH THE TOOLS TO BETTER

05:26:22.829 --> 05:26:24.898
UNDERSTAND BUDGETS, SPOT RED

05:26:24.965 --> 05:26:26.733
FLAGS, AND ASK THE RIGHT

05:26:26.800 --> 05:26:28.568
QUESTIONS. THESE SKILLS ARE

05:26:28.635 --> 05:26:29.670
ESPECIALLY VITAL AS LOCAL

05:26:29.736 --> 05:26:30.837
GOVERNMENTS ARE GOING TO FACE

05:26:30.904 --> 05:26:32.205
TOUGH BUDGET CHOICES IN THE

05:26:32.272 --> 05:26:34.207
YEARS AHEAD. WE ALSO APPRECIATE

05:26:34.274 --> 05:26:36.443
THAT SB 827 OFFERS FLEXIBILITY

05:26:36.510 --> 05:26:38.278
IN TRAINING FORMATS, ALLOWING

05:26:38.345 --> 05:26:40.781
BOTH IN-PERSON AND ONLINE

05:26:40.847 --> 05:26:42.916
OPTIONS, AND THIS ENSURES

05:26:42.983 --> 05:26:44.318
FLEXIBILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY

05:26:44.384 --> 05:26:45.452
FOR OFFICIALS AND COMMUNITIES OF

05:26:45.519 --> 05:26:47.988
ALL SIZES AND ALL REGIONS ACROSS

05:26:48.055 --> 05:26:50.924
CALIFORNIA. SB 827 IS A

05:26:50.991 --> 05:26:52.626
THOUGHTFUL AND NEEDED REFORM

05:26:52.693 --> 05:26:54.328
THAT PROMOTES BETTER GOVERNANCE

05:26:54.394 --> 05:26:56.964
WITHOUT IMPOSING UNDUE BURDEN.

05:26:57.030 --> 05:26:58.131
COMMON CAUSE SUPPORTS THIS BILL,

05:26:58.198 --> 05:27:00.233
AND WE THANK THE AUTHOR AND THE

05:27:00.300 --> 05:27:01.301
COMMITTEE FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON

05:27:01.368 --> 05:27:02.703
THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. THANK YOU.

05:27:02.769 --> 05:27:05.238
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN.

05:27:05.305 --> 05:27:06.940
MEMBERS, ON BEHALF OF THE LOS

05:27:07.007 --> 05:27:08.141
ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT

05:27:08.208 --> 05:27:10.777
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, AS MY FRIENDS

05:27:10.844 --> 05:27:13.280
HAVE STATED, IT IS IMPORTANT FOR

05:27:13.347 --> 05:27:14.815
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO RECEIVE

05:27:14.881 --> 05:27:17.084
THIS TRAINING. THE LOCAL

05:27:17.150 --> 05:27:20.721
OFFICIALS, THE BUDGETING AND

05:27:20.787 --> 05:27:22.856
APPROPRIATE APPROPRIATING OF

05:27:22.923 --> 05:27:24.825
PUBLIC MONIES IS ONE OF THE MOST

05:27:24.891 --> 05:27:26.860
IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS THAT THEY

05:27:26.927 --> 05:27:29.696
HAVE. STATE LAW RIGHT NOW

05:27:29.763 --> 05:27:30.764
REQUIRES THAT THEY RECEIVE

05:27:30.831 --> 05:27:32.599
ETHICS TRAINING, BUT THERE'S NO

05:27:32.666 --> 05:27:34.167
REQUIREMENT IN STATE LAW THAT

05:27:34.234 --> 05:27:36.269
THEY RECEIVE ANY KIND OF

05:27:36.336 --> 05:27:38.839
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT TRAINING.

05:27:38.905 --> 05:27:41.608
FOLLOWING THE CRIMINAL

05:27:41.675 --> 05:27:42.376
CONVICTIONS IN THE CITY OF BELL,

05:27:42.442 --> 05:27:45.379
DUE TO THE PUBLIC

05:27:45.445 --> 05:27:47.014
MISAPPROPRIATION OF FUNDS, THE

05:27:47.080 --> 05:27:49.149
STATE CREATED THE HIGH RISK

05:27:49.216 --> 05:27:51.018
AUDITING PROGRAM FOR THE STATE

05:27:51.084 --> 05:27:53.653
AUDITOR TO IDENTIFY LOCAL CITIES

05:27:53.720 --> 05:27:56.423
AND COUNTIES THAT ARE AT HIGH

05:27:56.490 --> 05:27:58.125
RISK DUE TO FRAUD,

05:27:58.191 --> 05:27:59.960
MISMANAGEMENT. UNDER THAT

05:28:00.027 --> 05:28:02.896
PROGRAM, THE AUDITOR IS REQUIRED

05:28:02.963 --> 05:28:04.898
TO ISSUE A REPORT EVERY THREE

05:28:04.965 --> 05:28:07.601
YEARS FOR THOSE JURISDICTIONS.

05:28:07.667 --> 05:28:09.403
FOR EXAMPLE, IN 2016, THE

05:28:09.469 --> 05:28:11.138
AUDITOR RECOGNIZED THE CITY OF

05:28:11.204 --> 05:28:12.839
MAYWOOD IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY AS

05:28:12.906 --> 05:28:15.742
BEING AT HIGH RISK DUE TO SOME

05:28:15.809 --> 05:28:18.678
UNUSUAL FINANCIAL PRACTICES. THE

05:28:18.745 --> 05:28:21.314
CITY OF MAYWOOD RESPONDED TO

05:28:21.381 --> 05:28:24.818
THOSE CONCERNS, AND IN 2019,

05:28:24.885 --> 05:28:27.387
WHEN THE AUDITOR RELEASED THEIR

05:28:27.454 --> 05:28:29.523
UPDATE, THEY REMOVED MAYWOOD

05:28:29.589 --> 05:28:30.857
FROM THE HIGH RISK AUDIT

05:28:30.924 --> 05:28:33.527
PROGRAM. WHILE MAYWOOD DID WHAT

05:28:33.593 --> 05:28:35.495
WE WANT OUR LOCAL OFFICIALS TO

05:28:35.562 --> 05:28:38.131
DO, UNFORTUNATELY, MANY OTHER

05:28:38.198 --> 05:28:41.334
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT DO THAT. IN

05:28:41.401 --> 05:28:43.904
RESPONSE, THE AUDITOR FREQUENTLY

05:28:43.970 --> 05:28:45.739
RECOMMENDS THE EXACT TYPE OF

05:28:45.806 --> 05:28:48.575
TRAINING CALLED FOR IN AB 827 AS

05:28:48.642 --> 05:28:50.744
THE REMEDY. AND FOR THAT REASON,

05:28:50.811 --> 05:28:52.079
WE ARE PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS

05:28:52.145 --> 05:28:54.714
BILL AND THINK THAT IT WILL

05:28:54.781 --> 05:28:57.884
REDUCE THE INSTANCES OF PUBLIC

05:28:57.951 --> 05:28:59.419
MISMANAGEMENT AND THEREBY

05:28:59.486 --> 05:29:01.154
HOPEFULLY REDUCE THE INSTANCES

05:29:01.221 --> 05:29:02.389
WHERE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS LIKE

05:29:02.456 --> 05:29:03.657
MYSELF HAVE TO BRING THESE

05:29:03.723 --> 05:29:06.226
CASES. SO WE ASK FOR A VOTE.

05:29:06.293 --> 05:29:07.494
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY.

05:29:07.561 --> 05:29:09.129

05:29:10.630 --> 05:29:12.132

AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS. AND THIS

05:29:24.311 --> 05:29:26.179
IS A REALLY IMPORTANT MEASURE

05:29:26.246 --> 05:29:27.180
THAT WILL EXPAND A COMMON

05:29:27.247 --> 05:29:28.648
KNOWLEDGE OF THE THINGS THAT

05:29:28.715 --> 05:29:29.282

CITIES HERE TODAY IN A POSITION

05:29:54.207 --> 05:29:56.309
OF OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. CAL

05:29:56.376 --> 05:29:57.210
CITIES BELIEVES IN CONDUCTING

05:29:57.277 --> 05:29:59.446
THE BUSINESS OF GOVERNMENT WITH

05:29:59.513 --> 05:30:00.881
TRANSPARENCY, OPENNESS, RESPECT

05:30:00.947 --> 05:30:03.917
AND CIVILITY. WHILE WE'RE NOT

05:30:03.984 --> 05:30:05.318

TRAINING REQUIREMENTS IN SB 827,

05:30:07.521 --> 05:30:09.222
CAL CITIES BELIEVES THAT STATE

05:30:09.289 --> 05:30:10.690
OFFICIALS AND AGENCIES SHOULD

05:30:10.757 --> 05:30:12.459
CONFORM TO THE SAME REQUIREMENTS

05:30:12.526 --> 05:30:13.927
OF TRANSPARENCY AND ETHICAL

05:30:13.994 --> 05:30:15.762
BEHAVIOR AS IS IMPOSED ON LOCAL

05:30:15.829 --> 05:30:17.531
OFFICIALS AND AGENCIES. CAL

05:30:17.597 --> 05:30:19.332
CITIES OPPOSES LEGISLATION THAT

05:30:19.399 --> 05:30:21.034
APPLIES SOLELY TO CALIFORNIA

05:30:21.101 --> 05:30:22.736
CITIES AND LOCAL OFFICIALS,

05:30:22.802 --> 05:30:24.304
UNLESS SUCH LAW OR REGULATION

05:30:24.371 --> 05:30:25.839
ALSO APPLIES EQUALLY TO THE

05:30:25.906 --> 05:30:28.008
STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND STATE

05:30:28.074 --> 05:30:29.042
OFFICIALS. WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

05:30:29.109 --> 05:30:30.443
LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND STATE

05:30:30.510 --> 05:30:31.811
GOVERNMENT HAVE THEIR OWN UNIQUE

05:30:31.878 --> 05:30:33.713
NEEDS AND UNDERSTAND THAT THAT

05:30:33.780 --> 05:30:35.248
TRAINING FOR LOCAL OFFICIALS

05:30:35.315 --> 05:30:36.583
VERSUS STATE OFFICIALS WOULD

05:30:36.650 --> 05:30:38.051
INCLUDE DIFFERENT STANDARDS, BUT

05:30:38.118 --> 05:30:40.487
WE THINK THAT WOULD STILL BE

05:30:40.554 --> 05:30:41.254
APPROPRIATE IF THE IF THE

05:30:41.321 --> 05:30:42.789
LEGISLATURE WISHES TO EXPAND

05:30:42.856 --> 05:30:44.191
LOCAL ETHICS AND FISCAL

05:30:44.257 --> 05:30:45.592
TRAINING, IT SHOULD ALSO APPLY

05:30:45.659 --> 05:30:47.794
SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS ONTO

05:30:47.861 --> 05:30:48.895
THEMSELVES AS WELL. AND FOR

05:30:48.962 --> 05:30:50.297
THOSE REASONS, THE LEAGUE OF

05:30:50.363 --> 05:30:51.831
CALIFORNIA CITIES RESPECTFULLY

05:30:51.898 --> 05:30:53.600
OPPOSES SB 827 UNLESS IT'S

05:30:53.667 --> 05:30:55.368
AMENDED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

05:30:55.435 --> 05:30:56.336
GOOD EVENING, DOROTHY JOHNSON

05:30:56.403 --> 05:30:57.437
WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF

05:30:57.504 --> 05:30:58.371
CALIFORNIA SCHOOL

05:30:58.438 --> 05:30:59.339
ADMINISTRATORS. WE ARE OPPOSED,

05:30:59.406 --> 05:31:01.408
UNLESS AMENDED. SO READY AND

05:31:01.474 --> 05:31:03.009
EAGER. WE ARE ABOUT TO MOVE TO

05:31:03.076 --> 05:31:05.278
NEUTRAL DUE TO THE GREAT WORK

05:31:05.345 --> 05:31:05.912
BETWEEN THE AUTHORS, STAFF AND

05:31:05.979 --> 05:31:07.981
THIS COMMITTEE, THE BILL AND ITS

05:31:08.048 --> 05:31:08.982
APPLICATION WAS TAKING SOME

05:31:09.049 --> 05:31:10.717
TERMS THAT APPLY TO CITIES AND

05:31:10.784 --> 05:31:11.851
COUNTIES. SCHOOLS ARE LOCAL

05:31:11.918 --> 05:31:13.753
GOVERNMENTS, BUT WE'RE ALSO VERY

05:31:13.820 --> 05:31:14.387
DIFFERENT IN OUR STRUCTURE. SO

05:31:14.454 --> 05:31:15.822
WE'RE JUST NARROWING IT A LITTLE

05:31:15.889 --> 05:31:17.324
BIT SO THAT WE'RE NOT REQUIRING

05:31:17.390 --> 05:31:18.725
THIS TRAINING TO APPLY TO THOSE

05:31:18.792 --> 05:31:20.860
WHO HAVE NO BUDGETARY OR

05:31:20.927 --> 05:31:21.628
ACCOUNTING OR EXPENDITURE

05:31:21.695 --> 05:31:23.897
AUTHORITY. SO LOOK FORWARD TO

05:31:23.964 --> 05:31:25.932
VERY SOON MOVING TO NEUTRAL. AND

05:31:25.999 --> 05:31:27.367
THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO

05:31:27.434 --> 05:31:29.202
SHARE THAT TODAY. THANK YOU.

05:31:29.269 --> 05:31:33.907
ANYBODY ELSE WANTS TO ADD ON IN

05:31:33.974 --> 05:31:34.941
OPPOSITION TO SEEING NO ONE

05:31:35.008 --> 05:31:36.376
COMMITTEE MEMBERS COMMENTS

05:31:36.443 --> 05:31:37.444
QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO

05:31:37.510 --> 05:31:38.945
AND THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER WILSON.

05:31:39.012 --> 05:31:42.082
THANK YOU. SO MY CONCERN AND

05:31:42.148 --> 05:31:45.385
I'VE SHARED WITH THE SENATOR IS

05:31:45.452 --> 05:31:47.254
I WAS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER FOR

05:31:47.320 --> 05:31:49.923
13 YEARS, AND THIS ENCOMPASSES

05:31:49.990 --> 05:31:52.525
FOLKS LIKE PRINCIPALS THAT ARE

05:31:52.592 --> 05:31:53.360
ADMINISTRATORS OR NOT

05:31:53.426 --> 05:31:54.427
NECESSARILY IN CHARGE OF BUDGET.

05:31:54.494 --> 05:31:55.829
THEY'RE IN CHARGE OF THEIR OWN

05:31:55.895 --> 05:31:58.632
BUDGETS. BUT THE I BELIEVE THE

05:31:58.698 --> 05:32:00.166
INTENT IS FOR THE SCHOOL BOARD

05:32:00.233 --> 05:32:03.570
OR THE AGENCY TO BE THE ONES

05:32:03.637 --> 05:32:04.871
THAT ARE BEING HELD TO THESE

05:32:04.938 --> 05:32:05.939
STANDARDS. SO I'VE EXPRESSED

05:32:06.006 --> 05:32:08.141
THAT. SO AND I KNOW YOU'RE

05:32:08.208 --> 05:32:09.843
WORKING ON IT. THE OTHER ISSUE

05:32:09.909 --> 05:32:11.978
THAT THAT I DO HAVE, AND I THINK

05:32:12.045 --> 05:32:13.613
YOU STATED IT, THAT WE CAN DO

05:32:13.680 --> 05:32:14.981
ETHICS TRAININGS ALL WE WANT.

05:32:15.048 --> 05:32:17.050
THE CORRUPTION HAS NOTHING TO

05:32:17.117 --> 05:32:19.252
DO. THE WHOLE POINT IS THAT

05:32:19.319 --> 05:32:20.654
THEY'RE UNETHICAL. AND SO WE CAN

05:32:20.720 --> 05:32:22.455
PROVIDE ETHICS TRAININGS ALL WE

05:32:22.522 --> 05:32:25.025
WANT. THE I THINK THE EXAMPLE OF

05:32:25.091 --> 05:32:26.526
THE CITIES AND I'VE BEEN AROUND

05:32:26.593 --> 05:32:28.395
THIS IS MY 28TH YEAR AS AN

05:32:28.461 --> 05:32:30.263
ELECTED. SO I'VE SEEN, YOU KNOW,

05:32:30.330 --> 05:32:31.898
SOUTHGATE AND YOU KNOW, JUST ALL

05:32:31.965 --> 05:32:33.667
OF THESE DIFFERENT AGENCIES THAT

05:32:33.733 --> 05:32:36.469
HAVE DONE THIS IN SOUTHGATE, THE

05:32:36.536 --> 05:32:38.738
VERY TREASURER WAS THE ONE THAT

05:32:38.805 --> 05:32:40.407
WAS WAS DOING ALL OF THIS. AND

05:32:40.473 --> 05:32:42.242
SO, SO I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE

05:32:42.309 --> 05:32:44.044
TRAINING WOULD HAVE HELPED IN

05:32:44.110 --> 05:32:46.179
THAT INSTANCE. SO I DON'T WANT

05:32:46.246 --> 05:32:48.315
TO LUMP EVERYBODY WITH THE SAME,

05:32:48.381 --> 05:32:50.684
YOU KNOW, KIND OF WITH THE SAME

05:32:50.750 --> 05:32:51.618
ISSUES, UNDERSTANDING THAT

05:32:51.685 --> 05:32:52.852
THERE'S VERY DIFFERENT AGENTS,

05:32:52.919 --> 05:32:54.120
YOU KNOW, MANY DIFFERENT

05:32:54.187 --> 05:32:55.188
AGENCIES THAT HAVE

05:32:55.255 --> 05:32:55.922
ADMINISTRATORS. SO IF WE CAN

05:32:55.989 --> 05:32:58.024
CLARIFY THE ADMINISTRATOR PART

05:32:58.091 --> 05:33:02.829
OF IT, AND I UNDERSTAND THE

05:33:02.896 --> 05:33:04.964
REQUEST FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

05:33:05.031 --> 05:33:07.400
HAVE ETHICS TRAINING, WE DO HAVE

05:33:07.467 --> 05:33:11.471
NOT SPECIFIC TO, TO FINANCE, FOR

05:33:11.538 --> 05:33:13.039
EXAMPLE, BUT WE DO HAVE ETHICS

05:33:13.106 --> 05:33:14.908
TRAINING THAT TALK ABOUT, YOU

05:33:14.974 --> 05:33:16.910
KNOW, THE FINANCING AND WHAT WE

05:33:16.976 --> 05:33:19.346
CAN AND CAN'T DO. SO IT'S NOT

05:33:19.412 --> 05:33:21.581
EXACTLY WHAT THIS IS, BUT WE DO

05:33:21.648 --> 05:33:23.249
HAVE SOME TRAINING. AND THEN THE

05:33:23.316 --> 05:33:26.152
OTHER CONCERN IS WE HAVE WHEN WE

05:33:26.219 --> 05:33:27.320
TAKE THESE TRAININGS, WE ALL

05:33:27.387 --> 05:33:28.822
SAY, OH, WELL, THE STATE WILL

05:33:28.888 --> 05:33:30.924
PAY FOR IT. BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT

05:33:30.990 --> 05:33:31.925
DURING BUDGETARY ISSUES, THE

05:33:31.991 --> 05:33:34.094
FIRST THING TO GO ARE THOSE

05:33:34.160 --> 05:33:35.628
REIMBURSEMENTS FOR MANDATES. AND

05:33:35.695 --> 05:33:37.964
SO THAT IS ALSO A CONCERN,

05:33:38.031 --> 05:33:39.165
ESPECIALLY TO OUR SCHOOL

05:33:39.232 --> 05:33:41.735
DISTRICTS, THAT THE MONEY IS

05:33:41.801 --> 05:33:43.036
LIMITED. THE MONEY SHOULD BE

05:33:43.103 --> 05:33:45.071
GOING TO THE KIDS. AND WHEN THE

05:33:45.138 --> 05:33:46.973
STATE DECIDES NOT TO PAY FOR

05:33:47.040 --> 05:33:48.775
THOSE MANDATES, THEN THE KIDS

05:33:48.842 --> 05:33:51.644
ARE ARE THE MONEY FOR THE KIDS

05:33:51.711 --> 05:33:53.546
GET TAKEN AWAY BECAUSE THE STATE

05:33:53.613 --> 05:33:54.981
DOESN'T HAVE A WAY OF PAYING FOR

05:33:55.048 --> 05:33:56.349
IT. SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE

05:33:56.416 --> 05:33:57.884
ISSUES THAT I'VE HAD ABOUT THE

05:33:57.951 --> 05:33:59.386
BILL. I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING ON

05:33:59.452 --> 05:34:01.454
IT, SENATOR, BUT I REALLY WANT

05:34:01.521 --> 05:34:03.723
TO SEE THAT THAT THESE ISSUES

05:34:03.790 --> 05:34:05.291
ARE RESOLVED BEFORE, YOU KNOW,

05:34:05.358 --> 05:34:10.096
WE CAN CONTINUE. BUT AGAIN, THE

05:34:10.163 --> 05:34:12.899
CORRUPTION, I HATE TO SAY IT, IT

05:34:12.966 --> 05:34:15.101
IS NOT A QUESTION OF TRAINING. I

05:34:15.168 --> 05:34:16.836
THINK THE CORRUPTION IN SOME THE

05:34:16.903 --> 05:34:18.138
CITY OF MY PARENTS LIVE IN THE

05:34:18.204 --> 05:34:19.873
CITY OF BELL. WE'VE BEEN THERE

05:34:19.939 --> 05:34:21.908
FOR 35 YEARS, SO I KNOW EXACTLY

05:34:21.975 --> 05:34:23.209
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, THAT

05:34:23.276 --> 05:34:24.477
THE ETHICS TRAINING WOULD NOT

05:34:24.544 --> 05:34:26.980
HAVE HELPED. I THINK THE, THE,

05:34:27.046 --> 05:34:29.349
YOU KNOW, THE SOME OF THE

05:34:29.416 --> 05:34:30.517
COUNCIL MEMBERS WERE JUST

05:34:30.583 --> 05:34:32.318
OVERLOOKING WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

05:34:32.385 --> 05:34:33.753
IN MY HUMBLE OPINION. THEY KNEW

05:34:33.820 --> 05:34:36.656
WHAT WAS HAPPENING. BUT TO THE

05:34:36.723 --> 05:34:38.858
POINT IS, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO

05:34:38.925 --> 05:34:41.828
TIGHTEN THE WHO ARE IS TO

05:34:41.895 --> 05:34:43.263
RECEIVE THE TRAINING, WHO'S

05:34:43.329 --> 05:34:44.931
GOING TO PAY FOR IT. AND AGAIN,

05:34:44.998 --> 05:34:47.500
IF OUR THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE

05:34:47.567 --> 05:34:50.670
TO BE ADDRESSED BECAUSE I THINK

05:34:50.737 --> 05:34:51.938
WE'RE LUMPING IN A WHOLE BUNCH

05:34:52.005 --> 05:34:54.441
OF THE ADMINISTRATORS AND IF I

05:34:54.507 --> 05:34:55.675
MAY RESPOND THROUGH THE CHAIR,

05:34:55.742 --> 05:34:57.977
WE HAVE EXEMPTED SCHOOL BOARD

05:34:58.044 --> 05:35:00.079
MEMBERS. THE SITE PRINCIPALS IS

05:35:00.146 --> 05:35:02.649
GOING TO BE WORKED ON. SO THAT

05:35:02.715 --> 05:35:04.150
LANGUAGE IS IN THE WORKS SO WE

05:35:04.217 --> 05:35:05.985
CAN GET THEM TO NEUTRAL. THAT

05:35:06.052 --> 05:35:06.986
WAS NOT THE INTENT, BUT I HEAR

05:35:07.053 --> 05:35:08.955
YOU LOUD AND CLEAR. LIKE I SAID

05:35:09.022 --> 05:35:10.223
WITH THIS BILL IS, YOU KNOW,

05:35:10.290 --> 05:35:13.326
THIS. I WISH THIS WOULD BE A

05:35:13.393 --> 05:35:14.060
VISION ZERO FOR CORRUPTION IN

05:35:14.127 --> 05:35:16.629
OUR COMMUNITIES. OF COURSE, THAT

05:35:16.696 --> 05:35:17.664
UNFORTUNATELY MAY NOT HAPPEN,

05:35:17.730 --> 05:35:19.499
BUT I THINK THIS JUST GIVES

05:35:19.566 --> 05:35:21.367
ANOTHER CHECK AND BALANCE TO

05:35:21.434 --> 05:35:24.337
THOSE THAT ARE DOING SOME MISUSE

05:35:24.404 --> 05:35:25.939
OF PUBLIC FUNDS AND EMBEZZLEMENT

05:35:26.005 --> 05:35:27.874
AND ALL THE THINGS THAT

05:35:27.941 --> 05:35:28.541
QUESTIONABLE CONTRACTING. WHEN I

05:35:28.608 --> 05:35:30.944
SPOKE WITH DAR HOFFMAN THIS PAST

05:35:31.010 --> 05:35:32.879
FRIDAY, HE SAID IT GIVES HIM AN

05:35:32.946 --> 05:35:35.915
EXTRA LEG UP IN LEVERAGE IN

05:35:35.982 --> 05:35:37.283
PROSECUTING BECAUSE IT BASICALLY

05:35:37.350 --> 05:35:38.852
STATES THAT IF YOU SAID YOU DID

05:35:38.918 --> 05:35:40.687
THIS AND YOU DID, IT GIVES HIM

05:35:40.753 --> 05:35:44.123
AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROSECUTE IN A

05:35:44.190 --> 05:35:45.992
DIFFERENT WAY. AND PERHAPS

05:35:46.059 --> 05:35:47.660
DANIEL CAN TALK A BIT MORE ABOUT

05:35:47.727 --> 05:35:50.029
THAT. BUT I HEAR YOU, BUT I

05:35:50.096 --> 05:35:51.831
THINK WE CAN'T NOT DO ANYTHING.

05:35:51.898 --> 05:35:52.899
I THINK THERE'S, YOU KNOW,

05:35:52.966 --> 05:35:54.601
THERE'S COMMUNITY MEMBERS OF

05:35:54.667 --> 05:35:56.836
MINE THAT WANT TO SEE SOME SORT

05:35:56.903 --> 05:35:59.072
OF CHANGE OR THAT THERE IS SOME

05:35:59.138 --> 05:36:01.474
SORT OF ACCOUNTABILITY ON THESE

05:36:01.541 --> 05:36:03.576
ELECTED OFFICIALS, CITY

05:36:03.643 --> 05:36:05.812
MANAGERS. RIGHT NOW, CITY

05:36:05.879 --> 05:36:07.680
ATTORNEYS ARE NOT THERE OFTEN,

05:36:07.747 --> 05:36:09.082
SOMETIMES FLYING UNDER THE RADAR

05:36:09.148 --> 05:36:11.684
AS IT PERTAINS TO THIS WORK, TO

05:36:11.751 --> 05:36:12.852
THEY'RE NOT ELECTED OR APPOINTED

05:36:12.919 --> 05:36:14.988
IN SOME CASES. AND SO WE WANT TO

05:36:15.054 --> 05:36:16.789
MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE INCLUDED

05:36:16.856 --> 05:36:18.992
HERE TOO. AND THEN FOR EXAMPLE,

05:36:19.058 --> 05:36:21.227
LIKE THE CITY OF SOUTHGATE, IT'S

05:36:21.294 --> 05:36:22.328
INTERESTING. THEY ACTUALLY HAVE

05:36:22.395 --> 05:36:24.230
A ROTATING CITY AUDITOR. SO IT

05:36:24.297 --> 05:36:26.699
WOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR A COUNCIL

05:36:26.766 --> 05:36:28.568
MEMBER WHO IS A ROTATING CITY

05:36:28.635 --> 05:36:31.337
AUDITOR TO ALSO HAVE THIS, THIS

05:36:31.404 --> 05:36:32.071
INFORMATION, THIS, THIS

05:36:32.138 --> 05:36:33.172
TRAINING, BECAUSE I THINK IT'S

05:36:33.239 --> 05:36:34.908
IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO UNDERSTAND

05:36:34.974 --> 05:36:38.211
THE BASICS OF, OF BUDGETING, YOU

05:36:38.278 --> 05:36:40.013
KNOW, MUNICIPAL BUDGETING. SO

05:36:40.079 --> 05:36:43.082
I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT. BUT I

05:36:43.149 --> 05:36:45.618
DON'T KNOW IF MY WITNESS WOULD

05:36:45.685 --> 05:36:46.819
LIKE TO ADD ANY MORE. THE ONLY

05:36:46.886 --> 05:36:48.755
THING I'D SAY IS THE SENATE IS

05:36:48.821 --> 05:36:50.123
CORRECT. OBVIOUSLY, IF IT GETS

05:36:50.189 --> 05:36:52.258
TO THE POINT WHERE A CRIMINAL

05:36:52.325 --> 05:36:53.426
PROSECUTION HAS TO BE BROUGHT

05:36:53.493 --> 05:36:56.496
SHOWING PROOF OF THAT, AN

05:36:56.563 --> 05:36:57.397
INDIVIDUAL COMPLETED ONE OF

05:36:57.463 --> 05:36:59.766
THESE CLASSES AND WAS AWARE OF

05:36:59.832 --> 05:37:01.601
THEIR DUTIES AND

05:37:01.668 --> 05:37:02.702
RESPONSIBILITIES, AND THEN

05:37:02.769 --> 05:37:05.204
WILLFULLY VIOLATED THOSE

05:37:05.271 --> 05:37:07.173
RESPONSIBILITIES. I CAN SAY IN

05:37:07.240 --> 05:37:09.142
LOS ANGELES COUNTY, WE HAVE THE

05:37:09.208 --> 05:37:12.011
RIVER CITY PORTION, WHICH HAS

05:37:12.078 --> 05:37:14.914
ITS OWN CORRUPTION ISSUES, BUT

05:37:14.981 --> 05:37:16.416
IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTY AND

05:37:16.482 --> 05:37:17.684
OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE,

05:37:17.750 --> 05:37:20.286
SOMETIMES WE DO HAVE LOCAL

05:37:20.353 --> 05:37:23.990
OFFICIALS WHO. FOR LACK OF A

05:37:24.057 --> 05:37:26.059
BETTER, UNKNOWINGLY, UNWITTINGLY,

05:37:26.125 --> 05:37:29.062
ARE COMMITTING SOME FISCAL

05:37:29.128 --> 05:37:29.762
IRREGULARITIES BECAUSE THEY

05:37:29.829 --> 05:37:34.767
DIDN'T KNOW THEIR CITY MANAGERS.

05:37:34.834 --> 05:37:36.169
WHATEVER ADMINISTRATOR IS

05:37:36.235 --> 05:37:39.172
ADVISING THEM DIDN'T DO GOOD

05:37:39.238 --> 05:37:42.008
ENOUGH JOB. AND THEN IT COMES TO

05:37:42.075 --> 05:37:44.410
THE ATTENTION OF LAW

05:37:44.477 --> 05:37:45.011
ENFORCEMENT. HOPEFULLY WE CAN

05:37:45.078 --> 05:37:47.013
AVOID THOSE CASES. AS YOU SAID,

05:37:47.080 --> 05:37:48.648
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE CITY OF

05:37:48.715 --> 05:37:51.751
BELL? COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. BUT

05:37:51.818 --> 05:37:53.119
IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS, THIS

05:37:53.186 --> 05:37:56.255
TYPE OF TRAINING VERY WELL MAY

05:37:56.322 --> 05:37:57.790
ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR CRIMINAL

05:37:57.857 --> 05:38:01.361
CASES TO BE BROUGHT. AND SO

05:38:01.427 --> 05:38:05.665
THANK YOU. YES. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

05:38:05.732 --> 05:38:07.467
WILSON, FIRST, THANK YOU. AND

05:38:07.533 --> 05:38:10.370
THE AUTHOR AND I HAVE HAD A

05:38:10.436 --> 05:38:11.871
CONVERSATION AROUND THIS AND I

05:38:11.938 --> 05:38:15.908
AND SOME TEXT EXCHANGES AND. SO

05:38:15.975 --> 05:38:19.445
I WANT TO PARSE BETWEEN TWO

05:38:19.512 --> 05:38:22.281
ASPECTS OF THIS BILL. ONE ASPECT

05:38:22.348 --> 05:38:23.783
OF IT IS ETHICS, WHICH IS

05:38:23.850 --> 05:38:25.251
CURRENTLY REQUIRED RIGHT NOW FOR

05:38:25.318 --> 05:38:27.920
LOCAL OFFICIALS AND THE

05:38:27.987 --> 05:38:29.789
REQUIREMENT TO EXPAND IT TO

05:38:29.856 --> 05:38:30.890
THOSE IN APPOINTED POSITIONS,

05:38:30.957 --> 05:38:32.692
LIKE YOUR CITY MANAGER AND

05:38:32.759 --> 05:38:35.595
OTHERS. AND IT'S SOMETHING, AS

05:38:35.662 --> 05:38:38.931
MY COLLEAGUE NOTED, THAT ELECTED

05:38:38.998 --> 05:38:41.200
OFFICIALS HAVE TO DO IT FROM THE

05:38:41.267 --> 05:38:42.669
TOP TO THE BOTTOM. I DON'T KNOW

05:38:42.735 --> 05:38:43.936
ABOUT FEDS, LET'S SAY FROM THE

05:38:44.003 --> 05:38:46.005
STATE DOWN, WE HAVE TO WE HAVE

05:38:46.072 --> 05:38:47.206
TO DO IT. AND I THINK THAT'S

05:38:47.273 --> 05:38:48.241
THAT'S REASONABLE. WE SHOULD

05:38:48.307 --> 05:38:49.976
IT'S ACROSS THE BOARD. AND I

05:38:50.043 --> 05:38:51.778
THINK THE SAME SHOULD BE SHOULD

05:38:51.844 --> 05:38:53.179
HAPPEN FOR OUR APPOINTED

05:38:53.246 --> 05:38:54.981
OFFICIALS OR OFFICIALS IN Kò

05:38:55.048 --> 05:38:56.849
MANAGEMENT, JUST LIKE I IF I

05:38:56.916 --> 05:38:58.217
RECALL CORRECTLY, I THINK OUR

05:38:58.284 --> 05:39:00.186
STAFF ALL HAVE TO HAVE AN ETHICS

05:39:00.253 --> 05:39:01.454
CLASS. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, SO IT'S

05:39:01.521 --> 05:39:03.189
EXPANSIVE AND ETHICS MAKES SENSE

05:39:03.256 --> 05:39:04.257
BECAUSE ETHICS, WE LIKE TO THINK

05:39:04.323 --> 05:39:06.859
ETHICS IS COMMON SENSE, BUT IT

05:39:06.926 --> 05:39:09.395
IS. THERE'S A LOT OF GRAY.

05:39:09.462 --> 05:39:10.797
RIGHT. AND WHETHER SOMETHING IS

05:39:10.863 --> 05:39:12.365
ETHICAL OR NOT, AND YOU CAN

05:39:12.432 --> 05:39:13.433
THINK YOU'RE WITHIN THE BOUNDS

05:39:13.499 --> 05:39:17.370
OF LAW. AND IT'S LEGAL BUT NOT

05:39:17.437 --> 05:39:18.838
ETHICAL. RIGHT. AND SO I THINK

05:39:18.905 --> 05:39:20.773
PART OF THE TRAINING IS HELPING

05:39:20.840 --> 05:39:22.675
YOU DETERMINE ON A CASE BY CASE

05:39:22.742 --> 05:39:24.877
SITUATION OF WHAT IS ETHICAL. SO

05:39:24.944 --> 05:39:26.713
NOW SO THAT'S THAT PART OF THE

05:39:26.779 --> 05:39:28.314
BILL. NO ISSUES WERE MY ISSUES

05:39:28.381 --> 05:39:30.283
COME IN IS ON THE FISCAL

05:39:30.349 --> 05:39:32.251
FINANCIAL AND YOU MIGHT THINK

05:39:32.318 --> 05:39:34.020
LIKE WHY LORI. BECAUSE YOU KNOW

05:39:34.087 --> 05:39:35.755
THAT'S MY BACKGROUND. WHY

05:39:35.822 --> 05:39:37.023
SHOULDN'T EVERYBODY HAVE THAT.

05:39:37.090 --> 05:39:38.424
RIGHT. AND I DO THINK EVERYBODY

05:39:38.491 --> 05:39:40.359
SHOULD. IT'S A FOR ME THE

05:39:40.426 --> 05:39:41.894
DISTINCTION IS SHOULD THE STATE

05:39:41.961 --> 05:39:45.031
BE COMPELLED TO FORCE AN ELECTED

05:39:45.098 --> 05:39:47.233
OFFICIAL TO HAVE FISCAL AND

05:39:47.300 --> 05:39:49.368
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT TRAINING

05:39:49.435 --> 05:39:51.938
WHEN NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU GET

05:39:52.004 --> 05:39:53.339
INTO THE DAY TO DAY OF FINANCE,

05:39:53.406 --> 05:39:55.875
AN ELECTED OFFICIAL IS NOT DOING

05:39:55.942 --> 05:39:57.877
THE DAY TO DAY OF FINANCE AT

05:39:57.944 --> 05:39:59.779
THEIR BOARD MEETINGS IN PUBLIC.

05:39:59.846 --> 05:40:01.848
THEY ARE PROVIDING OVERSIGHT.

05:40:01.914 --> 05:40:02.982
THEY HAVE A FIDUCIARY

05:40:03.049 --> 05:40:03.649
RESPONSIBILITY. THEY'RE NOT

05:40:03.716 --> 05:40:04.751
INVOLVED IN IT. THEY'RE NOT

05:40:04.817 --> 05:40:05.985
CUTTING A CHECK. THEY'RE NOT

05:40:06.052 --> 05:40:07.553
DOING ANY OF THOSE THINGS THEY

05:40:07.620 --> 05:40:09.655
ARE DOING. THEY ARE ACTING ON

05:40:09.722 --> 05:40:11.724
BEHALF OF THE PUBLIC TO UNDER

05:40:11.791 --> 05:40:13.793
PUBLIC, TRANSPARENT MEETING TO

05:40:13.860 --> 05:40:15.595
PROVIDE OVERSIGHT TO THE

05:40:15.661 --> 05:40:17.930
FINANCIAL SITUATION OF THE OF

05:40:17.997 --> 05:40:19.932
THE COMMUNITY, WHETHER IT BE

05:40:19.999 --> 05:40:21.901
LOCAL OR GOV. AND LIKE I SAID, I

05:40:21.968 --> 05:40:24.704
THINK THEY SHOULD, WHICH IS WHY

05:40:24.771 --> 05:40:25.705
CAL CITIES AND FOR THOSE THAT

05:40:25.772 --> 05:40:27.874
ARE A MEMBER OF CAL CITIES,

05:40:27.940 --> 05:40:29.075
WHICH IS MAJORITY OF THE CITIES

05:40:29.142 --> 05:40:29.976
IN OUR STATE, OFFERS A NEW

05:40:30.042 --> 05:40:31.711
MEMBER TRAINING. AND ONE OF THE

05:40:31.778 --> 05:40:33.880
ASPECTS OF THE NEW MEMBER

05:40:33.946 --> 05:40:34.447
TRAINING IS LET ME TELL YOU

05:40:34.514 --> 05:40:35.748
ABOUT FINANCE, BECAUSE EVEN IF

05:40:35.815 --> 05:40:37.450
YOU'RE NOT, IF YOU'VE NEVER DONE

05:40:37.517 --> 05:40:38.818
GOVERNMENT FINANCE, IT IS IT IS

05:40:38.885 --> 05:40:40.286
VERY DIFFERENT. AND SO IT'S

05:40:40.353 --> 05:40:41.654
THIS, THIS ASPECT OF WHETHER

05:40:41.721 --> 05:40:44.023
THEY SHOULD BE COMPELLED TO DO

05:40:44.090 --> 05:40:46.259
IT. AND I WHEN I WAS TALKING

05:40:46.325 --> 05:40:48.161
WITH THE AUTHOR AND YOU

05:40:48.227 --> 05:40:49.095
ELABORATED ON IT, I WAS TALKING

05:40:49.162 --> 05:40:50.897
TO THE AUTHOR. WE WERE TALKING

05:40:50.963 --> 05:40:52.498
ABOUT DA HOFFMAN NOTING THAT IT

05:40:52.565 --> 05:40:55.268
PROVIDES A LEVEL OF ADDITIONAL

05:40:55.334 --> 05:40:56.569
SCRUTINY. AND I'M JUST SO IT'S

05:40:56.636 --> 05:40:58.404
MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WHEN YOU

05:40:58.471 --> 05:41:00.373
BREAK THE LAW, YOU BREAK THE

05:41:00.439 --> 05:41:02.108
LAW. YOUR AWARENESS OF THAT LAW

05:41:02.175 --> 05:41:03.910
HAS NO BEARING ON WHETHER YOU

05:41:03.976 --> 05:41:05.978
BROKE THE LAW OR NOT. SO I DON'T

05:41:06.045 --> 05:41:08.281
UNDERSTAND THAT IF A COUNCIL

05:41:08.347 --> 05:41:11.017
MEMBER OR MAYOR OR SUPERVISOR

05:41:11.083 --> 05:41:12.852
NAME ONE OF YOUR ELECTED

05:41:12.919 --> 05:41:15.922
POSITIONS BROKE THE LAW, WHICH

05:41:15.988 --> 05:41:18.391
WOULD BE HARD TO DO FROM THE

05:41:18.457 --> 05:41:19.792
DÍAS POINT OF VIEW, UNLESS THEY

05:41:19.859 --> 05:41:21.127
WERE ACTIVELY IN FINANCE, WHICH

05:41:21.194 --> 05:41:22.862
THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED. I'M TRYING

05:41:22.929 --> 05:41:24.397
TO FIGURE OUT WHY WOULD THAT

05:41:24.463 --> 05:41:26.265
GIVE A JUST BECAUSE I WAS THAT

05:41:26.332 --> 05:41:27.500
PART? I DON'T UNDERSTAND,

05:41:27.567 --> 05:41:29.235
BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE

05:41:29.302 --> 05:41:31.037
IT FLIES IN THE FACE OF WHAT I

05:41:31.103 --> 05:41:33.039
KNOW TO BE TRUE ABOUT LAW. AND I

05:41:33.105 --> 05:41:34.941
AM NOT A LAWYER. I'VE TAKEN, I

05:41:35.007 --> 05:41:36.275
THINK, LAW 101 AND THAT'S ABOUT

05:41:36.342 --> 05:41:38.845
IT. OR MAYBE LAW ONE. I THINK IT

05:41:38.911 --> 05:41:41.614
WAS LAW LAW ONE AND TWO. I DON'T

05:41:41.681 --> 05:41:42.882
THINK ONE ON ONE. I THINK THAT'S

05:41:42.949 --> 05:41:44.016
UPPER CLASS UPPER. SO I'M NOT IN

05:41:44.083 --> 05:41:46.219
ANY WAY. AND THAT WAS LIKE 20

05:41:46.285 --> 05:41:48.020
YEARS AGO. SO TOOK ONE CLASS ON

05:41:48.087 --> 05:41:48.955
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW TOO. SO I'M

05:41:49.021 --> 05:41:50.723
WITH YOU ON THAT. BUT THANK YOU

05:41:50.790 --> 05:41:52.959
VERY MUCH THROUGH THE CHAIR AS

05:41:53.025 --> 05:41:54.227
WELL. FIRST, ON THE DAY TO DAY

05:41:54.293 --> 05:41:55.761
ACTIVITIES, I WOULD SAY I HAVE A

05:41:55.828 --> 05:41:57.330
VERY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE AS A

05:41:57.396 --> 05:41:58.464
LONG BEACH CITY COUNCIL MEMBER.

05:41:58.531 --> 05:42:00.833
I DEFINITELY DIRECTED MONEY. WE

05:42:00.900 --> 05:42:01.601
HAD WHAT WAS CALLED DIVIDE BY

05:42:01.667 --> 05:42:03.135
NINE MONEY WE WERE GIVEN. I

05:42:03.202 --> 05:42:04.303
DON'T KNOW, LET ME JUST SAY

05:42:04.370 --> 05:42:07.607
$50,000 TO DIRECT DIRECTLY

05:42:07.673 --> 05:42:08.774
IMPACTING, YOU KNOW, I WANT TO

05:42:08.841 --> 05:42:11.510
PAY FOR THIS EVENT HERE. I WANT

05:42:11.577 --> 05:42:12.678
TO PAY FOR THIS PARK UPGRADE

05:42:12.745 --> 05:42:14.780
HERE. I WANT TO DO THIS HERE.

05:42:14.847 --> 05:42:15.281
WELL, I'M TALKING ABOUT

05:42:15.348 --> 05:42:17.416
SOMETHING DIFFERENT. DID YOU DID

05:42:17.483 --> 05:42:18.184
YOU RECEIVE $50,000 IN YOUR HAND

05:42:18.251 --> 05:42:19.886
OR DID YOU CUT THAT CHECK FOR

05:42:19.952 --> 05:42:22.088
50? WELL, I RECEIVED IT IN MY

05:42:22.154 --> 05:42:23.089
COUNCIL ACCOUNT. RIGHT. AND SO

05:42:23.155 --> 05:42:24.457
YOU COULD SAY THAT THAT DIRECT

05:42:24.523 --> 05:42:25.825
MONEY, BUT IT HAS SOME LEVEL.

05:42:25.892 --> 05:42:27.326
YOU COULDN'T DO THAT WITHOUT THE

05:42:27.393 --> 05:42:29.262
PUBLIC KNOWING WHO YOU GAVE THAT

05:42:29.328 --> 05:42:30.429
MONEY TO. RIGHT. OF COURSE. BUT

05:42:30.496 --> 05:42:32.865
I WOULD SAY IT'S DAY TO DAY. I

05:42:32.932 --> 05:42:34.667
WOULD SAY THAT WE ALSO WERE IN

05:42:34.734 --> 05:42:36.502
CLOSED SESSION TALKING ABOUT

05:42:36.569 --> 05:42:37.236
PENSIONS. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE

05:42:37.303 --> 05:42:39.305
TALKING ABOUT. YEAH. AND I DRAW

05:42:39.372 --> 05:42:40.406
A DISTINCTION BETWEEN GIVING

05:42:40.473 --> 05:42:42.441
OVERSIGHT TO AND DIRECTING WHICH

05:42:42.508 --> 05:42:44.977
ALL DO VERSUS. SO I WHAT I'M

05:42:45.044 --> 05:42:47.914
TALKING TO DAY TO DAY IS YOUR

05:42:47.980 --> 05:42:48.481
ACCOUNTANT AND YOUR FINANCE

05:42:48.547 --> 05:42:49.382
PERSON OR A MANAGER OVER A

05:42:49.448 --> 05:42:50.883
BUDGET. NOT NECESSARILY THIS I

05:42:50.950 --> 05:42:52.551
REALLY WOULD LIKE TO STAY

05:42:52.618 --> 05:42:55.521
FOCUSED ON THIS CRIMINAL ASPECT

05:42:55.588 --> 05:42:57.256
OF IT, BECAUSE I THINK WE DO

05:42:57.323 --> 05:42:59.792
DISAGREE ON WHAT ROLE THEY HAVE

05:42:59.859 --> 05:43:01.327
AND WHETHER THEY SHOULD BE

05:43:01.394 --> 05:43:02.295
COMPELLED TO REMEMBER. I THINK

05:43:02.361 --> 05:43:03.696
THEY SHOULD. I THINK THERE

05:43:03.763 --> 05:43:04.997
SHOULD. IT'S JUST WHETHER THE

05:43:05.064 --> 05:43:07.366
STATE COMPELS. SO I WOULD REALLY

05:43:07.433 --> 05:43:09.568
BUT YOU WENT ON A LINE AND IT

05:43:09.635 --> 05:43:10.770
WAS EXPLORED MORE ABOUT THE

05:43:10.836 --> 05:43:12.438
CRIMINAL ASPECT OF IT. AND SO

05:43:12.505 --> 05:43:14.307
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW

05:43:14.373 --> 05:43:16.709
THIS BOLSTERS CRIMINALITY IN

05:43:16.776 --> 05:43:18.210
CRIMINAL COURT ON WHETHER

05:43:18.277 --> 05:43:20.346
SOMEONE DID SOMETHING WRONG.

05:43:20.413 --> 05:43:21.914
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. AND I WILL,

05:43:21.981 --> 05:43:23.349
THROUGH THE CHAIR DEFER TO MY

05:43:23.416 --> 05:43:25.284
WITNESS. BUT I DID SPEAK

05:43:25.351 --> 05:43:26.185
DIRECTLY WITH DISTRICT ATTORNEY

05:43:26.252 --> 05:43:28.688
HOFFMAN LAST FRIDAY ON THIS, AND

05:43:28.754 --> 05:43:30.356
HE ABSOLUTELY SAID, I WISH THAT

05:43:30.423 --> 05:43:31.857
THIS WAS LIKE, YOU KNOW, 16

05:43:31.924 --> 05:43:33.693
POINT FONT, THAT YOU HAD

05:43:33.759 --> 05:43:35.161
EVERYTHING VERY CLEAR THAT

05:43:35.227 --> 05:43:37.363
PEOPLE CAN SIGN AND SAY THAT

05:43:37.430 --> 05:43:39.465
THEY HAVE TAKEN THIS KNOWINGLY

05:43:39.532 --> 05:43:41.267
TAKEN THIS. IT HELPS BUILD THE

05:43:41.334 --> 05:43:43.602
CASE. BUT I WILL DEFER TO DANIEL

05:43:43.669 --> 05:43:45.504
ON THIS AS WELL. IF THERE'S

05:43:45.571 --> 05:43:46.172
ADDITIONAL POINTS YOU'D LIKE TO

05:43:46.238 --> 05:43:49.809
ADD. YES, EACH CRIMINAL

05:43:49.875 --> 05:43:51.644
PROSECUTION IS GOING TO BE

05:43:51.711 --> 05:43:54.146
UNIQUE. SO BUT UNFORTUNATELY,

05:43:54.213 --> 05:43:56.415
LIKE I SAID, WE DO HAVE

05:43:56.482 --> 05:43:58.184
INSTANCES COUNCIL MEMBERS. WE

05:43:58.250 --> 05:44:00.619
HAD ISSUES IN THE CITY OF

05:44:00.686 --> 05:44:05.358
COMPTON. WE'VE HAD ISSUES IN

05:44:05.424 --> 05:44:07.159
MAYWOOD. WE'VE HAD ISSUES IN

05:44:07.226 --> 05:44:10.429
BELL, WE'VE HAD ISSUES IN VERNON

05:44:10.496 --> 05:44:14.333
IN WHERE LOCAL OFFICIALS HAVE

05:44:14.400 --> 05:44:17.003
DISCRETIONARY MONEY, WHETHER

05:44:17.069 --> 05:44:18.671
IT'S IN AN INDIVIDUAL COUNCIL

05:44:18.738 --> 05:44:20.439
MEMBER'S ACCOUNT, WHETHER IT'S

05:44:20.506 --> 05:44:24.443
DISCRETIONARY MONEY IN A CITY, I

05:44:24.510 --> 05:44:25.678
WOULD ASSUME A SPECIAL DISTRICT

05:44:25.745 --> 05:44:28.114
WOULD BE THE SAME THING. BUT

05:44:28.180 --> 05:44:31.283
DISCRETIONARY MONEY THAT IS

05:44:31.350 --> 05:44:34.220
ALLOCATED AT THE REQUEST AND

05:44:34.286 --> 05:44:35.855
DIRECTION OF THE BOARD, WHETHER

05:44:35.921 --> 05:44:38.524
THE CITY COUNCIL, WHATEVER GROUP

05:44:38.591 --> 05:44:42.728
IT IS. WHICH IN ITSELF IS FINE.

05:44:42.795 --> 05:44:45.264
NO, IT'S MONEY CAN BE DIRECTED

05:44:45.331 --> 05:44:46.899
TO GREAT PROGRAMS.

05:44:46.966 --> 05:44:48.234
UNFORTUNATELY, THERE ARE TIMES

05:44:48.300 --> 05:44:50.836
WHEN THOSE ALLOCATIONS, THE

05:44:50.903 --> 05:44:55.141
DIRECTION OF MONEY ARE GOING TO

05:44:55.207 --> 05:44:56.909
INDIVIDUALS THAT, YOU KNOW,

05:44:56.976 --> 05:44:58.344
THERE'S A THERE'S A CONFLICT OF

05:44:58.411 --> 05:45:02.248
INTEREST IN. AND, YOU KNOW,

05:45:02.314 --> 05:45:03.649
SOMETIMES WE'VE BEEN I MEAN,

05:45:03.716 --> 05:45:06.552
I'VE BEEN AWARE OF AN INDIVIDUAL

05:45:06.619 --> 05:45:09.121
WHO THE CITY COUNCIL MEMBER DID

05:45:09.188 --> 05:45:11.991
NOT REALIZE THERE WAS THE

05:45:12.058 --> 05:45:14.093
CONFLICT EXISTED BECAUSE THEY

05:45:14.160 --> 05:45:16.228
JUST WERE NOT AWARE OF WHAT THE

05:45:16.295 --> 05:45:18.097
LAWS WERE. PERSONALLY, I THINK

05:45:18.164 --> 05:45:21.333
THAT WAS THE FAULT OF THEIR CITY

05:45:21.400 --> 05:45:23.803
STAFF FOR NOT PROPERLY EDUCATING

05:45:23.869 --> 05:45:27.406
THEM. BUT IT HAPPENED. WHEN

05:45:27.473 --> 05:45:31.077
THESE CASES ARISE TO THE LEVEL

05:45:31.143 --> 05:45:33.145
LIKE WE HAD IN THE CITY OF BELL,

05:45:33.212 --> 05:45:35.347
THEN THERE'S A NEED FOR A

05:45:35.414 --> 05:45:38.617
CRIMINAL PROSECUTION, YOU KNOW,

05:45:38.684 --> 05:45:42.288
AND THE ISSUE IS, YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:45:42.354 --> 05:45:43.989
FIRST OFF, WHAT WAS THE

05:45:44.056 --> 05:45:45.524
MISAPPROPRIATION? WHAT WAS THE

05:45:45.591 --> 05:45:48.694
CONFLICT? YOU KNOW, BUT THEN IF

05:45:48.761 --> 05:45:53.032
WE CAN SHOW THAT THE INDIVIDUAL

05:45:53.099 --> 05:45:55.534
RECEIVED TRAINING ON WHATEVER

05:45:55.601 --> 05:45:57.670
THAT ISSUE IS, ASSUMING THAT

05:45:57.736 --> 05:45:59.939
THAT ISSUE WAS COVERED DOESN'T

05:46:00.005 --> 05:46:01.373
NECESSARILY MEAN IT WOULD BE.

05:46:01.440 --> 05:46:04.210
BUT IF IT WAS AND SAY YOU TOOK

05:46:04.276 --> 05:46:08.481
THIS TRAINING ON THIS DAY AND SO

05:46:08.547 --> 05:46:12.051
YOU WERE AWARE OF YOUR DUTY AND

05:46:12.118 --> 05:46:13.919
RESPONSIBILITY, AND HERE'S THE

05:46:13.986 --> 05:46:16.021
EVIDENCE THAT SHOWS THAT YOU

05:46:16.088 --> 05:46:17.890
WILLFULLY AND INTENTIONALLY

05:46:17.957 --> 05:46:19.658
VIOLATED THAT DUTY AND

05:46:19.725 --> 05:46:22.128
RESPONSIBILITY. THAT IS GREAT

05:46:22.194 --> 05:46:25.397
EVIDENCE TO USE IN A PUBLIC

05:46:25.464 --> 05:46:27.166
CORRUPTION CASE. AND PUBLIC

05:46:27.233 --> 05:46:30.336
CORRUPTION CASES ARE NOTORIOUSLY

05:46:30.402 --> 05:46:31.904
DIFFICULT TO BRING JUST BECAUSE

05:46:31.971 --> 05:46:34.006
OF THE NATURE OF WHAT'S GOING

05:46:34.073 --> 05:46:36.609
ON. SO WHEN YOU HAVE EVIDENCE

05:46:36.675 --> 05:46:40.212
THAT SHOWS THIS INDIVIDUAL KNEW

05:46:40.279 --> 05:46:41.881
OF THEIR DUTY AND

05:46:41.947 --> 05:46:43.382
RESPONSIBILITY, AND THEY

05:46:43.449 --> 05:46:45.251
INTENTIONALLY AND WILLFULLY

05:46:45.317 --> 05:46:46.619
VIOLATED THAT DUTY AND

05:46:46.685 --> 05:46:48.087
RESPONSIBILITY IN VIOLATION OF

05:46:48.154 --> 05:46:50.589
SOME STATE, OR IF IT'S A FEDERAL

05:46:50.656 --> 05:46:51.223
PROSECUTOR, FEDERAL LAW. THANK

05:46:51.290 --> 05:46:52.791
YOU. AND I JUST NOTE THAT THE

05:46:52.858 --> 05:46:54.493
EXAMPLES THAT YOU GAVE ALL

05:46:54.560 --> 05:46:55.694
RELATE TO ETHICS, NOT

05:46:55.761 --> 05:46:56.962
NECESSARILY TO FISCAL AND

05:46:57.029 --> 05:46:58.631
FINANCIAL TRAINING. HAVING HAD

05:46:58.697 --> 05:47:00.599
IT SEVERAL TIMES BECAUSE I

05:47:00.666 --> 05:47:01.800
PARTICIPATED IN CAL CITIES AND

05:47:01.867 --> 05:47:02.868
OTHER TYPES OF TRAINING,

05:47:02.935 --> 05:47:05.004
SPECIFICALLY AS IT RELATES TO MY

05:47:05.070 --> 05:47:06.138
ROLE AS A COUNCIL MEMBER AND

05:47:06.205 --> 05:47:08.040
THEN SUBSEQUENTLY AS A MAYOR. SO

05:47:08.107 --> 05:47:11.443
I THINK IT'S IT WOULD BE BOTH

05:47:11.510 --> 05:47:13.045
CONCERNED AND, AND, AND, YOU

05:47:13.112 --> 05:47:15.080
KNOW, I NOTED THAT I WAS LIKELY

05:47:15.147 --> 05:47:16.582
NOT SUPPORTING AND I DON'T THINK

05:47:16.649 --> 05:47:18.450
WHAT WHAT'S BEEN SAID HERE IS

05:47:18.517 --> 05:47:20.786
BOLSTERED TO GET ME TO CHANGE MY

05:47:20.853 --> 05:47:22.054
MIND. BUT I THANK YOU TO THE

05:47:22.121 --> 05:47:23.956
AUTHOR, BECAUSE I KNOW THIS IS

05:47:24.023 --> 05:47:25.491
SOMETHING THAT YOU CARE DEEPLY

05:47:25.558 --> 05:47:26.292
ABOUT. I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS

05:47:26.358 --> 05:47:28.327
YOU HAVE WITHIN YOUR COMMUNITY,

05:47:28.394 --> 05:47:28.961
AND YOU FEEL LIKE THIS IS THE

05:47:29.028 --> 05:47:30.596
RIGHT SOLUTION FOR THAT. YES.

05:47:30.663 --> 05:47:33.098
THANK YOU, SENATOR, WE'RE GOING

05:47:33.165 --> 05:47:34.099
TO GO TO ASSEMBLYMAN BRONSON AND

05:47:34.166 --> 05:47:36.468
THEN PACHECO, I WANT TO I DON'T

05:47:36.535 --> 05:47:37.970
KNOW, MAYBE I CAN HELP YOU OUT,

05:47:38.037 --> 05:47:39.772
SENATOR. SO THANK YOU FOR

05:47:39.838 --> 05:47:41.006
BRINGING THIS BILL. I'D ACTUALLY

05:47:41.073 --> 05:47:42.474
LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COAUTHOR

05:47:42.541 --> 05:47:44.210
TO THIS. THANK YOU. AND MAYBE

05:47:44.276 --> 05:47:46.745
SOME OF YOU KNOW, MY EXPERIENCE,

05:47:46.812 --> 05:47:48.280
MAYBE I CAN MAYBE ADD SOME

05:47:48.347 --> 05:47:50.382
VALUE. I DON'T KNOW, BUT BEFORE

05:47:50.449 --> 05:47:51.850
I EVER SERVED ON A CITY COUNCIL

05:47:51.917 --> 05:47:54.587
OR PLANNING COMMISSION, I SERVED

05:47:54.653 --> 05:47:56.155
ON A CIVIL GRAND JURY. AND IN

05:47:56.222 --> 05:47:58.324
THAT WE FOUND THAT A LOT OF

05:47:58.390 --> 05:47:59.191
THINGS THAT HAPPENED, PEOPLE

05:47:59.258 --> 05:48:00.826
WOULD JUST CLAIM IGNORANCE,

05:48:00.893 --> 05:48:02.995
RIGHT? AND THAT WOULD BE THINGS

05:48:03.062 --> 05:48:06.599
LIKE USING PUBLIC AGENCY CREDIT

05:48:06.665 --> 05:48:07.766
CARD OR SCHOOL DISTRICT CREDIT

05:48:07.833 --> 05:48:09.768
CARD OR CITY CREDIT CARD,

05:48:09.835 --> 05:48:11.670
FILLING UP THE GAS FOR THEIR

05:48:11.737 --> 05:48:13.606
FAMILY. WE'VE HAD CITY MANAGERS

05:48:13.672 --> 05:48:16.308
BE TERMINATED FOR MISMANAGEMENT,

05:48:16.375 --> 05:48:18.110
FINANCIAL MISMANAGEMENT OF

05:48:18.177 --> 05:48:20.079
DISCRETIONARY FUNDS, CREDIT CARD

05:48:20.145 --> 05:48:22.615
FUNDS. IF YOU LOOK UP STOCKTON,

05:48:22.681 --> 05:48:24.516
JUST LAST WEEK, THERE WAS A

05:48:24.583 --> 05:48:27.553
TRIAL OF SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER FOR

05:48:27.620 --> 05:48:29.688
MISMANAGING DOLLARS. AND WHAT

05:48:29.755 --> 05:48:31.824
THEY DETERMINED OR FOUND IN THE

05:48:31.890 --> 05:48:33.959
TRIAL IS THAT LOTS OF SCHOOL

05:48:34.026 --> 05:48:36.528
BOARD MEMBERS, $11,000 ON

05:48:36.595 --> 05:48:38.264
EATING, YOU KNOW, MEALS OR

05:48:38.330 --> 05:48:39.832
TAKING FAMILY. LIKE THERE WERE

05:48:39.898 --> 05:48:43.669
SO MANY EXAMPLES OF FOLKS JUST

05:48:43.736 --> 05:48:45.070
MISMANAGING DOLLARS. SO MAYBE MY

05:48:45.137 --> 05:48:45.971
COUNTY IS JUST A LITTLE

05:48:46.038 --> 05:48:48.741
DIFFERENT. MAYBE WE DON'T MOVE

05:48:48.807 --> 05:48:49.742
THE SAME WAY AS, AS YOU KNOW.

05:48:49.808 --> 05:48:54.113
AND SO AND WHAT WE ALSO FOUND OR

05:48:54.179 --> 05:48:56.282
WHAT WE ALSO LEARNED IS THAT

05:48:56.348 --> 05:48:57.950
THERE WEREN'T CLEAR POLICIES AND

05:48:58.017 --> 05:49:00.452
CLEAR INFORMATION. AND SO, YOU

05:49:00.519 --> 05:49:02.955
KNOW, WHEN YOU SAY, HEY, YOU

05:49:03.022 --> 05:49:04.790
MISMANAGED GOVERNMENT MONEY. AND

05:49:04.857 --> 05:49:06.358
THEN PEOPLE WERE LIKE, WELL, I

05:49:06.425 --> 05:49:07.826
DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE

05:49:07.893 --> 05:49:09.595
RULES. AND PEOPLE JUST BROKE

05:49:09.662 --> 05:49:10.963
THEM ALL VERY DIFFERENTLY. BUT

05:49:11.030 --> 05:49:12.798
AT THE END OF THE DAY, THESE ARE

05:49:12.865 --> 05:49:14.633
PUBLIC DOLLARS THAT WERE

05:49:14.700 --> 05:49:16.735
MISMANAGED. AND WE'VE JUST SEEN

05:49:16.802 --> 05:49:18.537
IT ON SO MANY LEVELS, INCLUDING,

05:49:18.604 --> 05:49:19.972
LIKE I SAID, CITY MANAGERS

05:49:20.039 --> 05:49:21.774
MISUSING FUNDS. WE HAVE I JUST

05:49:21.840 --> 05:49:23.575
RECENTLY GOT A COMPLAINT BECAUSE

05:49:23.642 --> 05:49:25.044
WE HAVE BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS

05:49:25.110 --> 05:49:28.247
WHO GET $250,000 IN FUNDS, AND

05:49:28.314 --> 05:49:29.748
IT'S NOT HAPPENING LIKE THE

05:49:29.815 --> 05:49:31.250
PUBLIC IS FINDING OUT. AND THE

05:49:31.317 --> 05:49:32.985
MOST RECENT COMPLAINT THAT I

05:49:33.052 --> 05:49:35.754
RECEIVED WAS THAT SOMEONE GAVE

05:49:35.821 --> 05:49:37.356
MONEY TO SOMEONE THAT WAS A

05:49:37.423 --> 05:49:38.290
CAMPAIGN SUPPORTER. RIGHT? AND

05:49:38.357 --> 05:49:40.759
SO WHILE THEY MAY HAVE JUST BEEN

05:49:40.826 --> 05:49:43.362
SUPPORTING AN ORGANIZATION

05:49:43.429 --> 05:49:46.298
TRAINING TO ME, I THINK KIND OF

05:49:46.365 --> 05:49:49.301
CLEARS UP THE GRAY AREA FOR

05:49:49.368 --> 05:49:51.303
EVERYONE HAS NOT GOTTEN THAT

05:49:51.370 --> 05:49:52.738
EDUCATION. EVERYONE IS NOT

05:49:52.805 --> 05:49:54.273
SERVED IN PUBLIC GOVERNMENT

05:49:54.340 --> 05:49:55.174
BEFORE. THEY GOT TO WHEREVER

05:49:55.240 --> 05:49:57.743
THEY ARE NOW. AND I JUST THINK

05:49:57.810 --> 05:49:59.645
THAT IT'S THERE'S IT'S NOT NO

05:49:59.712 --> 05:50:02.514
HARM IN IT. AND I DO UNDERSTAND

05:50:02.581 --> 05:50:04.283
THE OPPOSITION, YOU KNOW, HAVING

05:50:04.350 --> 05:50:05.751
WORKED VERY CLOSELY 20 YEARS

05:50:05.818 --> 05:50:07.119
WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS, PUBLIC

05:50:07.186 --> 05:50:10.055
SCHOOLS, TO BE CLEAR, I DO THINK

05:50:10.122 --> 05:50:11.890
THAT THERE'S SO MANY LEVELS OF

05:50:11.957 --> 05:50:12.825
MANAGEMENT YOU PROBABLY WILL

05:50:12.891 --> 05:50:14.727
NEED TO CARVE OUT THE PEOPLE WHO

05:50:14.793 --> 05:50:16.995
DO NOT HAVE DISCRETIONARY FUNDS,

05:50:17.062 --> 05:50:19.598
BE HAVE CREDIT CARDS, SEE DIRECT

05:50:19.665 --> 05:50:20.999
OTHER PEOPLE. I DO THINK THAT

05:50:21.066 --> 05:50:22.701
THERE IS ROOM TO MAKE THEIR

05:50:22.768 --> 05:50:25.504
LIVES LIKE A LITTLE BIT EASIER.

05:50:25.571 --> 05:50:27.172
AND FOR THE LEAGUE OF CITIES

05:50:27.239 --> 05:50:29.641
THAT I, I GET IT. BUT HERE IN

05:50:29.708 --> 05:50:31.777
THE STATE LEGISLATURE, FIRST OF

05:50:31.844 --> 05:50:33.479
ALL, WE'RE VOTING ON THE VERY

05:50:33.545 --> 05:50:35.614
BIG BUDGET IN FRONT OF EVERYONE,

05:50:35.681 --> 05:50:37.383
YOU KNOW, AND WE DON'T GET

05:50:37.449 --> 05:50:39.251
PUBLIC CREDIT CARDS, WE DON'T

05:50:39.318 --> 05:50:40.586
GET TO DIRECT DOLLARS, AND WE

05:50:40.652 --> 05:50:43.088
HAVE EXTENSIVE TRAINING. SO I

05:50:43.155 --> 05:50:44.690
KNOW THAT SOME ORGANIZATIONS

05:50:44.757 --> 05:50:46.425
KIND OF NO MATTER WHO'S DOING

05:50:46.492 --> 05:50:47.960
IT, IF YOU KIND OF STEP IN THAT

05:50:48.026 --> 05:50:49.695
AREA, YOU GOT TO SAY WHAT YOU

05:50:49.762 --> 05:50:52.097
GOT TO SAY. BUT I DON'T THINK

05:50:52.164 --> 05:50:53.632
THAT THAT IS RELEVANT TO THIS

05:50:53.699 --> 05:50:55.567
PARTICULAR BILL. AND SO FOR

05:50:55.634 --> 05:50:57.436
THOSE REASONS, I REALLY THINK

05:50:57.503 --> 05:50:59.738
THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL.

05:50:59.805 --> 05:51:01.206
AND I THANK YOU, SENATOR,

05:51:01.273 --> 05:51:02.608
BECAUSE FOR ME, IN MY DISTRICT,

05:51:02.674 --> 05:51:04.009
I THINK THAT THIS WOULD BE

05:51:04.076 --> 05:51:06.211
SOMETHING GOOD FOR ME TO POINT

05:51:06.278 --> 05:51:08.013
TO, AND IT WOULD RESOLVE A LOT

05:51:08.080 --> 05:51:10.149
OF I WON'T SAY IT'S GOING TO

05:51:10.215 --> 05:51:12.317
SOLVE THE PROBLEMS BECAUSE, YOU

05:51:12.384 --> 05:51:13.752
KNOW, A THIEF IS GOING TO PICK A

05:51:13.819 --> 05:51:16.221
LOCK. DOESN'T MATTER. RIGHT? BUT

05:51:16.288 --> 05:51:16.989
FOR PEOPLE WHO JUST DON'T KNOW

05:51:17.055 --> 05:51:18.457
ANY BETTER AND THINK, HEY, YOU

05:51:18.524 --> 05:51:20.926
KNOW, I CAN JUST DO X, Y, AND Z,

05:51:20.993 --> 05:51:22.594
WE WANT TO CLEAR THOSE THINGS UP

05:51:22.661 --> 05:51:24.096
AND KEEP PEOPLE OUT OF TROUBLE.

05:51:24.163 --> 05:51:25.130
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. I

05:51:25.197 --> 05:51:26.732
APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS. THANK

05:51:26.799 --> 05:51:28.534
YOU, ASSEMBLY MEMBER PACHECO.

05:51:28.600 --> 05:51:32.538
THANK YOU. AND I DO HAVE SOME

05:51:32.604 --> 05:51:33.906
CONCERNS WITH WITH THIS BILL.

05:51:33.972 --> 05:51:36.041
AND I THINK I, I DISCUSSED THOSE

05:51:36.108 --> 05:51:37.843
WITH YOU, LIKE THE BUDGETARY

05:51:37.910 --> 05:51:39.678
SITUATION THAT WE'RE IN IN THE

05:51:39.745 --> 05:51:41.713
STATE. IT'S GOING TO WE'RE GOING

05:51:41.780 --> 05:51:44.383
TO HAVE THE STATE PAY FOR THIS.

05:51:44.450 --> 05:51:46.151
BUT WE HAVE BUDGETARY

05:51:46.218 --> 05:51:47.886
CONSTRAINTS RIGHT NOW WITH OUR

05:51:47.953 --> 05:51:49.321
BUDGET. AND ALSO, I THINK I

05:51:49.388 --> 05:51:51.156
EXPLAINED TO YOU THAT IF

05:51:51.223 --> 05:51:53.625
SOMEONE'S CORRUPT, NO AMOUNT OF

05:51:53.692 --> 05:51:55.961
TRAINING IS GOING TO PREVENT

05:51:56.028 --> 05:51:59.064
THEM FROM NOT BEING CORRUPT. AND

05:51:59.131 --> 05:52:01.967
I KNOW THE DA'S OFFICE IS

05:52:02.034 --> 05:52:04.136
SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL. AND I

05:52:04.203 --> 05:52:06.305
KNOW YOU HAD MENTIONED TO ME

05:52:06.371 --> 05:52:09.041
THAT THERE WERE AMENDMENTS TO

05:52:09.107 --> 05:52:11.009
STRENGTHEN THIS BILL. I DON'T

05:52:11.076 --> 05:52:12.010
SEE ANY AMENDMENTS. CAN YOU

05:52:12.077 --> 05:52:13.545
PLEASE EXPLAIN WHAT THOSE

05:52:13.612 --> 05:52:14.980
AMENDMENTS WERE? THERE WERE NO

05:52:15.047 --> 05:52:16.782
AMENDMENTS. YOU KNOW, THE

05:52:16.849 --> 05:52:18.183
COMMITTEE DID NOT PROVIDE ANY

05:52:18.250 --> 05:52:19.384
AMENDMENTS AT THIS TIME. I THINK

05:52:19.451 --> 05:52:21.820
THAT WHEN I HAD SPOKEN WITH DA

05:52:21.887 --> 05:52:23.121
HOFFMAN, HE HAD TALKED ABOUT,

05:52:23.188 --> 05:52:25.057
YOU KNOW, I THINK JUST IN, IN

05:52:25.123 --> 05:52:25.924
THEORY, JUST WANTING TO HAVE

05:52:25.991 --> 05:52:28.293
THIS BILL, BUT MAKING SURE THAT

05:52:28.360 --> 05:52:29.394
IT WAS EXTRA CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT

05:52:29.461 --> 05:52:31.864
PEOPLE WERE GOING TO BE ELECTED

05:52:31.930 --> 05:52:33.298
OFFICIALS AND APPOINTED MEMBERS

05:52:33.365 --> 05:52:34.733
AND CITY MANAGERS AND CITY

05:52:34.800 --> 05:52:36.235
ATTORNEYS BE ABLE TO CLEARLY

05:52:36.301 --> 05:52:38.036
STATE THAT THEY DID TAKE THIS.

05:52:38.103 --> 05:52:39.438
WE ARE ASKING THAT IT IS

05:52:39.505 --> 05:52:40.806
PUBLISHED. SO IT'S VERY CLEAR.

05:52:40.873 --> 05:52:42.107
BUT NO, NO AMENDMENTS AT THIS

05:52:42.174 --> 05:52:46.311
TIME IS MY SHORT ANSWER. AND I

05:52:46.378 --> 05:52:47.312
THINK THAT WE'RE ALWAYS GOING TO

05:52:47.379 --> 05:52:49.515
BE IN A BUDGETARY SITUATION.

05:52:49.581 --> 05:52:50.883
UNFORTUNATELY, IN THE NEXT FEW

05:52:50.949 --> 05:52:52.818
YEARS, THE STATE BUDGET IS GOING

05:52:52.885 --> 05:52:54.653
TO BE HORRIBLE, BUT I THINK IT'S

05:52:54.720 --> 05:52:56.421
BEST THAT WE PUT THIS FORWARD TO

05:52:56.488 --> 05:52:57.422
HOPEFULLY REIN IN SOME OF THE

05:52:57.489 --> 05:52:58.891
DOLLARS THAT HAVE BEEN SPENT. I

05:52:58.957 --> 05:53:00.659
REPRESENT HUNTINGTON PARK. THOSE

05:53:00.726 --> 05:53:02.861
TAXPAYERS THERE HAVE LITERALLY

05:53:02.928 --> 05:53:05.330
BEEN WAITING FOR $24 MILLION

05:53:05.397 --> 05:53:07.432
POOL THAT HAS NEVER BEEN BUILT,

05:53:07.499 --> 05:53:10.802
NEVER. I WOULD HAVE HOPED THAT,

05:53:10.869 --> 05:53:12.905
YOU KNOW, I THINK IT GOES

05:53:12.971 --> 05:53:14.973
BETWEEN THE LINE OF ETHICS AND

05:53:15.040 --> 05:53:16.875
FISCAL FINANCIAL TRAINING, BUT I

05:53:16.942 --> 05:53:19.244
WOULD HAVE HOPED THAT, YOU KNOW,

05:53:19.311 --> 05:53:21.179
THIS COULD HAVE DETERRED SOMEONE

05:53:21.246 --> 05:53:22.915
FROM MAKING THAT REALLY POOR

05:53:22.981 --> 05:53:26.585
DECISION OF NOT PROVIDING A POOL

05:53:26.652 --> 05:53:28.387
IN AN EXORBITANT AMOUNT OF MONEY

05:53:28.453 --> 05:53:29.955
OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS, MOSTLY VERY

05:53:30.022 --> 05:53:31.657
HARD WORKING PEOPLE THAT ONLY

05:53:31.723 --> 05:53:35.127
MAKE AT, YOU KNOW, PER CAPITA,

05:53:35.193 --> 05:53:39.231
$25,000 OR LESS PER HOUSEHOLD,

05:53:39.298 --> 05:53:41.033
THAT THEY WOULD HAVE MADE A

05:53:41.099 --> 05:53:41.934
BETTER DECISION. I AGAIN, THIS

05:53:42.000 --> 05:53:43.869
IS NOT GOING TO STOP EVERYTHING,

05:53:43.936 --> 05:53:45.971
BUT I THINK IT IS A SIGN THAT WE

05:53:46.038 --> 05:53:47.706
MEAN BUSINESS AND WE WANT THIS

05:53:47.773 --> 05:53:49.074
TO STOP. I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW

05:53:49.141 --> 05:53:51.877
THIS REALLY HELPS. AND MAYBE IF

05:53:51.944 --> 05:53:55.147
I COULD HEAR FROM, YOU KNOW, THE

05:53:55.213 --> 05:53:57.583
PERSON FROM DA HOFFMAN'S OFFICE,

05:53:57.649 --> 05:54:00.052
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS IT SEEMS

05:54:00.118 --> 05:54:03.789
LIKE WHAT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

05:54:03.855 --> 05:54:07.059
FIND IS INTENT. IF AS TO THAT'S

05:54:07.125 --> 05:54:09.461
A RATIONALE FOR TAKING THE

05:54:09.528 --> 05:54:10.796
TRAINING. BECAUSE IF YOU KNEW

05:54:10.862 --> 05:54:14.099
THAT YOU TOOK THE TRAINING AND

05:54:14.166 --> 05:54:17.002
YOU COMMITTED A CRIME THAT MAYBE

05:54:17.069 --> 05:54:18.837
AND YOU CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M

05:54:18.904 --> 05:54:19.972
WRONG, THAT THAT SOMEHOW PROVED

05:54:20.038 --> 05:54:21.773
SOME KIND OF INTENT. IS THAT

05:54:21.840 --> 05:54:23.542
CORRECT OR WHAT'S THE I STILL

05:54:23.609 --> 05:54:24.843
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE WHOLE

05:54:24.910 --> 05:54:28.080
PURPOSE OF LIKE OF HOW THIS

05:54:28.146 --> 05:54:29.948
HELPS IT. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO

05:54:30.015 --> 05:54:32.551
WITH THE INTENT. AND IF I MADE

05:54:32.618 --> 05:54:35.554
YOU THINK THAT I APOLOGIZE. YOUR

05:54:35.621 --> 05:54:37.189
INTENT IS WHAT IS IN YOUR HEAD.

05:54:37.255 --> 05:54:41.493
YES, BUT IT'S, FOR EXAMPLE, AN

05:54:41.560 --> 05:54:44.096
INDIVIDUAL USING A GAS CARD

05:54:44.162 --> 05:54:46.131
IMPROPERLY. THEY SAY, I DID NOT

05:54:46.198 --> 05:54:50.068
KNOW THAT I COULDN'T USE MY

05:54:50.135 --> 05:54:53.071
GOVERNMENT ISSUED GAS CARD TO

05:54:53.138 --> 05:54:56.708
FILL UP MY PERSONAL VEHICLE FOR

05:54:56.775 --> 05:55:01.380
MY FAMILY VACATION. IF WE CAN

05:55:01.446 --> 05:55:06.985
SHOW THAT YOU TOOK A. CLASS A

05:55:07.052 --> 05:55:08.153
TRAINING, AND IN THAT TRAINING,

05:55:08.220 --> 05:55:10.689
THEY TELL YOU THAT YOUR YOUR

05:55:10.756 --> 05:55:13.125
GOVERNMENT ISSUED CREDIT CARDS

05:55:13.191 --> 05:55:15.961
ARE NOT TO BE USED FOR PERSONAL

05:55:16.028 --> 05:55:17.796
EXPENSES. THAT DOESN'T GO TO

05:55:17.863 --> 05:55:20.065
YOUR INTENT. IT GOES TO YOUR

05:55:20.132 --> 05:55:22.601
KNOWLEDGE. DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU

05:55:22.668 --> 05:55:24.703
SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT? AND I

05:55:24.770 --> 05:55:26.038
THINK THAT'S ALREADY OFFERED IN

05:55:26.104 --> 05:55:27.205
OUR ETHICS TRAINING. SO I

05:55:27.272 --> 05:55:28.306
REMEMBER TAKING THE ETHICS

05:55:28.373 --> 05:55:30.308
TRAINING FROM THE LEAGUE OF

05:55:30.375 --> 05:55:30.909
CALIFORNIA CITIES, AND WE WERE

05:55:30.976 --> 05:55:32.210
TOLD THAT IN THE FINANCIAL PART

05:55:32.277 --> 05:55:34.112
OF THE ETHICS TRAINING. AND THEN

05:55:34.179 --> 05:55:36.114
WHEN I GOT ON CITY COUNCIL, I

05:55:36.181 --> 05:55:37.282
REMEMBER HAVING A CONVERSATION

05:55:37.349 --> 05:55:39.051
WITH MY CITY MANAGER BECAUSE WE

05:55:39.117 --> 05:55:42.320
WERE GIVEN A CITY CREDIT CARD.

05:55:42.387 --> 05:55:44.556
AND WHAT WE WERE, WE WERE TOLD,

05:55:44.623 --> 05:55:46.658
IS IT CAN ONLY BE DONE FOR CITY

05:55:46.725 --> 05:55:48.727
BUSINESS. AND WE HAD TO PROVIDE

05:55:48.794 --> 05:55:50.562
RECEIPTS, AND THEN THE FINANCE

05:55:50.629 --> 05:55:51.663
DEPARTMENT WOULD REVIEW

05:55:51.730 --> 05:55:52.731
EVERYTHING. AND I CAN BE

05:55:52.798 --> 05:55:54.666
CORRECT. I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD

05:55:54.733 --> 05:55:56.268
AND HAND IT OVER TO JOHNNY.

05:55:56.334 --> 05:55:57.436
MAYBE HE CAN EXPLAIN. IT HAS

05:55:57.502 --> 05:55:59.004
BEEN A WHILE SINCE I RECEIVED

05:55:59.071 --> 05:56:00.639
THE TRAINING, BUT MAYBE HE CAN

05:56:00.706 --> 05:56:02.874
EXPLAIN WHAT KIND OF TRAINING

05:56:02.941 --> 05:56:04.276
GOES IN PLACE AND WHETHER THIS

05:56:04.342 --> 05:56:06.845
IS COVERED, BECAUSE I COULD HAVE

05:56:06.912 --> 05:56:08.080
SWORN THIS WAS COVERED. SO CAN

05:56:08.146 --> 05:56:10.248
YOU PLEASE ANSWER THAT? THROUGH

05:56:10.315 --> 05:56:13.285
THE CHAIR? CAL CITY CERTAINLY

05:56:13.351 --> 05:56:18.290
DOES OFFER THE AB 1234 TRAINING.

05:56:18.356 --> 05:56:19.891
CONFERENCES. AND AS IS AS IS

05:56:19.958 --> 05:56:21.660
SPELLED OUT IN THE LAW, THERE

05:56:21.727 --> 05:56:23.862
HAS TO BE CERTAIN THINGS IN THAT

05:56:23.929 --> 05:56:25.330
TRAINING. I THINK THAT TRAINING

05:56:25.397 --> 05:56:26.565
MAY HAVE SOME DIFFERENT EXACT

05:56:26.631 --> 05:56:27.466
VARIATIONS DEPENDING ON WHETHER

05:56:27.532 --> 05:56:29.067
IT'S RECEIVED THROUGH THE LEAGUE

05:56:29.134 --> 05:56:30.936
OF CALIFORNIA CITIES OR IT'S OR

05:56:31.002 --> 05:56:32.037
IT'S THROUGH THE IN-HOUSE

05:56:32.104 --> 05:56:34.172
ATTORNEY OR THROUGH AN OUTSIDE

05:56:34.239 --> 05:56:37.442
FIRM, OR IT'S THROUGH THE PPC

05:56:37.509 --> 05:56:40.679
ALSO OFFERS A AN ONLINE VERSION

05:56:40.746 --> 05:56:42.514
AS WELL. TO THAT QUESTION OF IF

05:56:42.581 --> 05:56:44.282
THAT SPECIFICALLY IN THERE, I'M

05:56:44.349 --> 05:56:45.851
NOT ENTIRELY SURE, BUT I KNOW

05:56:45.917 --> 05:56:49.221
THERE ARE THERE ARE PIECES OF

05:56:49.287 --> 05:56:50.188
THE TRAINING THAT DOES TOUCH ON

05:56:50.255 --> 05:56:52.124
THAT BROADLY. OKAY. BECAUSE I DO

05:56:52.190 --> 05:56:53.992
REMEMBER MY CITY MANAGER WHEN I

05:56:54.059 --> 05:56:55.393
FIRST GOT ON CITY COUNCIL

05:56:55.460 --> 05:56:57.896
EXPLAINING TO ME, LIKE, WHAT

05:56:57.963 --> 05:57:01.099
EXACTLY CAN THE CREDIT CARD BE

05:57:01.166 --> 05:57:02.634
USED FOR? YOU WANT TO ELABORATE

05:57:02.701 --> 05:57:06.271
MORE? WHAT I WOULD SAY IS YOU

05:57:06.338 --> 05:57:09.875
LOOK AT THE STATE AUDITOR WHEN

05:57:09.941 --> 05:57:13.712
THEY HAVE THE HIGH RISK AUDIT

05:57:13.779 --> 05:57:15.547
PROGRAM, WHEN THE CITIES WHEN

05:57:15.614 --> 05:57:17.415
THEY ISSUED THEIR FOLLOW UP

05:57:17.482 --> 05:57:19.885
REPORTS, AND CITIES AND LOCAL

05:57:19.951 --> 05:57:22.354
GOVERNMENTS HAVEN'T SUFFICIENTLY

05:57:22.420 --> 05:57:26.057
IMPROVED TO BE REMOVED FROM THAT

05:57:26.124 --> 05:57:28.460
DESIGNATION, YOU HAVE THE STATE

05:57:28.527 --> 05:57:32.764
AUDITOR. SUGGESTING DOING THE

05:57:32.831 --> 05:57:35.267
EXACT TYPE OF TRAINING CALLED

05:57:35.333 --> 05:57:38.003
FOR HERE IN AB 20 OR EXCUSE ME,

05:57:38.069 --> 05:57:43.842
SB 827. THAT'S BECAUSE THE LEVEL

05:57:43.909 --> 05:57:45.610
OF TRAINING THAT IS AVAILABLE

05:57:45.677 --> 05:57:48.580
AND MAYBE THERE ARE SPECIFIC

05:57:48.647 --> 05:57:49.881
PROGRAMS THAT ARE REALLY GOOD. I

05:57:49.948 --> 05:57:51.550
AM NOT AN EXPERT ON EVERYTHING

05:57:51.616 --> 05:57:53.618
THAT'S BEING OFFERED, BUT THE

05:57:53.685 --> 05:57:56.321
FACT THAT THE AUDITOR HAS

05:57:56.388 --> 05:57:58.623
REPEATEDLY CALLED FOR LOCAL

05:57:58.690 --> 05:58:00.425
GOVERNMENTS TO RECEIVE THIS

05:58:00.492 --> 05:58:03.261
EXACT TYPE OF TRAINING, I THINK,

05:58:03.328 --> 05:58:07.332
IS EVIDENCE THAT THE TRAINING

05:58:07.399 --> 05:58:09.835
THAT IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE

05:58:09.901 --> 05:58:12.337
ISN'T SUFFICIENT FOR THE LOCAL

05:58:12.404 --> 05:58:14.439
OFFICIALS TO BE AWARE OF ALL OF

05:58:14.506 --> 05:58:16.942
THEIR DUTIES AND

05:58:17.008 --> 05:58:18.109
RESPONSIBILITIES. OTHERWISE, THE

05:58:18.176 --> 05:58:21.580
AUDITOR WOULDN'T BE REQUESTING

05:58:21.646 --> 05:58:23.081
FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO TAKE

05:58:23.148 --> 05:58:26.651
THIS VERY TYPE OF TRAINING. AND

05:58:26.718 --> 05:58:28.520
REGARDING THE TRAINING, WHO

05:58:28.587 --> 05:58:31.423
WOULD BE PROVIDING THE TRAINING?

05:58:31.489 --> 05:58:33.158
SOME AGENCY LIKE THE LEAGUE OF

05:58:33.225 --> 05:58:35.393
CALIFORNIA CITIES. YES, THIS IS

05:58:35.460 --> 05:58:36.761
FLEXIBLE. THIS OFFERS

05:58:36.828 --> 05:58:37.796
FLEXIBILITY. THE LEAGUE OF

05:58:37.863 --> 05:58:39.297
CALIFORNIA CITIES COULD DO THE

05:58:39.364 --> 05:58:40.298
TRAINING. IT COULD BE IN PERSON,

05:58:40.365 --> 05:58:42.934
IT COULD BE ONLINE. IT COULD BE

05:58:43.001 --> 05:58:44.669
CSAC PROVIDING THE TRAINING FOR

05:58:44.736 --> 05:58:46.805
THE COUNTIES. SO IT REALLY

05:58:46.872 --> 05:58:48.740
PROVIDES THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO

05:58:48.807 --> 05:58:50.208
GIVE THIS TRAINING. AND FOR

05:58:50.275 --> 05:58:51.176
EXAMPLE, YOU KNOW, I'LL PICK ON

05:58:51.243 --> 05:58:53.678
ONE OF MY CITIES THAT WAS NOTED

05:58:53.745 --> 05:58:55.947
IN THE DA HOCKMAN LETTER, THE

05:58:56.014 --> 05:58:59.351
CITY OF MAYWOOD IN 2016, PER THE

05:58:59.417 --> 05:59:02.754
HIGH RISK AUDIT PROGRAM THAT WAS

05:59:02.821 --> 05:59:04.122
IMPLEMENTED BY MY PREDECESSOR.

05:59:04.189 --> 05:59:05.690
SO HE ALSO REPRESENTED SOUTHEAST

05:59:05.757 --> 05:59:06.825
LOS ANGELES. THIS HAS BEEN GOING

05:59:06.892 --> 05:59:09.160
ON FOR SOME TIME. AS BEEN

05:59:09.227 --> 05:59:11.730
MENTIONED, THE CITY OF MAYWOOD

05:59:11.796 --> 05:59:13.231
HAD A REPORT THAT BASICALLY SAID

05:59:13.298 --> 05:59:14.933
A NUMBER OF THINGS, AND THEY

05:59:15.000 --> 05:59:16.534
AGAIN, THEY FLOW BETWEEN ETHICS

05:59:16.601 --> 05:59:17.903
AND FISCAL FINANCIAL TRAINING

05:59:17.969 --> 05:59:19.271
NEEDS, INADEQUATE OVERSIGHT OF

05:59:19.337 --> 05:59:21.373
CITY OPERATIONS, LACK OF

05:59:21.439 --> 05:59:24.309
TRANSPARENCY, ONGOING DEFICITS,

05:59:24.376 --> 05:59:26.344
DEFICIENT BUDGETING PROCESS,

05:59:26.411 --> 05:59:27.913
FAILURE TO MAXIMIZE REVENUE,

05:59:27.979 --> 05:59:30.482
POOR CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION AND

05:59:30.548 --> 05:59:32.083
INADEQUATE ACCOUNTING CONTROLS.

05:59:32.150 --> 05:59:33.952
YOU WILL NOT FIND THAT IN AN

05:59:34.019 --> 05:59:35.287
ETHICS TRAINING. YOU WILL FIND

05:59:35.353 --> 05:59:36.354
THAT MOSTLY IN A FISCAL

05:59:36.421 --> 05:59:38.690
FINANCIAL TRAINING THAT WOULD BE

05:59:38.757 --> 05:59:40.825
PROVIDED BY ONE OF OUR OUR

05:59:40.892 --> 05:59:41.993
PARTNERS, WHICH WE'D LOVE FOR

05:59:42.060 --> 05:59:43.828
THEM TO CONTINUE BEING PARTNERS.

05:59:43.895 --> 05:59:45.196
AND WHO'S GOING TO DETERMINE

05:59:45.263 --> 05:59:47.299
LIKE WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS, WHAT

05:59:47.365 --> 05:59:49.501
IS WHAT WOULD BE A PROPER

05:59:49.567 --> 05:59:52.170
TRAINING, THE CONTENT, BECAUSE

05:59:52.237 --> 05:59:54.506
WE MAY HAVE A SITUATION WHERE

05:59:54.572 --> 05:59:56.341
THIS LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES

05:59:56.408 --> 05:59:57.309
OFFERS THIS TYPE OF TRAINING,

05:59:57.375 --> 05:59:58.910
AND THEN ANOTHER ANOTHER AGENCY

05:59:58.977 --> 06:00:00.812
OFFERS ANOTHER TYPE OF TRAINING,

06:00:00.879 --> 06:00:03.248
LIKE HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE THAT

06:00:03.315 --> 06:00:04.883
THEY'RE ALL SIMILAR TO EACH

06:00:04.950 --> 06:00:06.151
OTHER? YEAH, THE CITIES, I MEAN,

06:00:06.217 --> 06:00:08.119
THEY CAN DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES.

06:00:08.186 --> 06:00:09.688
THE LOCAL AGENCIES CAN DECIDE

06:00:09.754 --> 06:00:11.089
WHICH TRAINING WOULD BENEFIT

06:00:11.156 --> 06:00:12.924
THEM THE MOST. WE DIDN'T WANT TO

06:00:12.991 --> 06:00:14.859
ADD MORE COMPLICATIONS TO CREATE

06:00:14.926 --> 06:00:16.594
A BRAND NEW PROGRAM, BECAUSE

06:00:16.661 --> 06:00:19.731
THAT WOULD ADD COST. AND SO WE

06:00:19.798 --> 06:00:21.833
WANT TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT.

06:00:21.900 --> 06:00:23.168
I MEAN, THE LEAGUE OF CITIES, WE

06:00:23.234 --> 06:00:25.370
WERE LOOKING AT A LOT OF THE

06:00:25.437 --> 06:00:26.404
TRAINING THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE

06:00:26.471 --> 06:00:28.073
AND EXIST, AND THEY HAVE

06:00:28.139 --> 06:00:29.741
TRAINING ON PENSIONS. THEY HAVE

06:00:29.808 --> 06:00:30.675
TRAINING ON ALL THE ABOVE ISSUES

06:00:30.742 --> 06:00:31.643
THAT I'VE BEEN MENTIONING. CSAC

06:00:31.710 --> 06:00:33.244
THE SAME FOR COUNTY OFFICIALS.

06:00:33.311 --> 06:00:34.179
SO THERE'S PLENTY OF TRAINING

06:00:34.245 --> 06:00:36.281
OUT THERE ALREADY. THERE'S A

06:00:36.348 --> 06:00:38.216
NUMBER OF OTHERS THAT HAVE BEEN

06:00:38.283 --> 06:00:39.517
LISTED IN THE ANALYSIS THAT

06:00:39.584 --> 06:00:41.419
COULD BE UTILIZED, AND I THINK

06:00:41.486 --> 06:00:43.555
WE START THERE IF WE NEED TO

06:00:43.621 --> 06:00:44.222
FINE TUNE THE TRAINING, YOU

06:00:44.289 --> 06:00:45.790
KNOW, LATER WE I'D BE HAPPY TO

06:00:45.857 --> 06:00:48.360
DO THAT. BUT AGAIN, TO YOUR

06:00:48.426 --> 06:00:49.227
POINT, IT WILL ADD ADDITIONAL

06:00:49.294 --> 06:00:50.729
COST. BUT I THINK WE NEED TO

06:00:50.795 --> 06:00:52.063
START SOMEWHERE. OKAY. THANK

06:00:52.130 --> 06:00:54.299
YOU. THANKS. SIMILAR ANSWERS.

06:00:54.366 --> 06:00:56.101
YOU WANT TO FOLLOW UP? JUST

06:00:56.167 --> 06:00:57.836
BECAUSE I ASKED TO BE ADDED AS

06:00:57.902 --> 06:00:59.371
COAUTHOR, I WOULD STRONGLY

06:00:59.437 --> 06:01:00.271
SUGGEST AND WOULD SUPPORT AND

06:01:00.338 --> 06:01:03.775
WOULD HELP TO IDENTIFY A

06:01:03.842 --> 06:01:05.810
TRAINING THAT WOULD BE

06:01:05.877 --> 06:01:07.212
CONSISTENT BECAUSE LIKE I SAID,

06:01:07.278 --> 06:01:09.047
WE JUST HAVING EXPERIENCES. WE

06:01:09.114 --> 06:01:10.115
DON'T WANT PEOPLE GOING LIKE,

06:01:10.181 --> 06:01:12.183
OH, I DIDN'T KNOW, RIGHT. AND

06:01:12.250 --> 06:01:13.785
THERE ARE TRAININGS THAT ARE

06:01:13.852 --> 06:01:15.920
VERY SPECIFIC TO WHAT YOU SHOULD

06:01:15.987 --> 06:01:17.322
AND SHOULD NOT DO WITH PUBLIC

06:01:17.389 --> 06:01:19.524
DOLLARS. WHAT SHOULD YOU KNOW

06:01:19.591 --> 06:01:21.626
HOW TO MANAGE CREDIT CARDS, HOW

06:01:21.693 --> 06:01:22.394
TO MANAGE DISCRETIONARY FUNDS?

06:01:22.460 --> 06:01:25.597
AND I WOULD LOVE TO HELP YOU

06:01:25.663 --> 06:01:27.332
WORK THROUGH THAT. I'D BE OPEN

06:01:27.399 --> 06:01:29.200
TO THAT. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE

06:01:29.267 --> 06:01:31.036
THE FEEDBACK ON ALL FRONTS. I

06:01:31.102 --> 06:01:34.239
SEE NO ONE ELSE. IS THERE A

06:01:34.305 --> 06:01:37.142
MOTION IN A SECOND? SECOND

06:01:37.208 --> 06:01:38.610
AMENDMENT WAS SECONDED BY

DELICATE BALANCE BETWEEN

06:03:24.048 --> 06:03:25.583
IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF

06:03:25.650 --> 06:03:26.417
COMMUNITIES IMPACTED BY THE

06:03:26.484 --> 06:03:28.319
BOOMING LOGISTICS INDUSTRY,

06:03:28.386 --> 06:03:29.387
WHILE ALLOWING THE INDUSTRY

06:03:29.454 --> 06:03:30.822
ENOUGH FLEXIBILITY TO CONTINUE

06:03:30.889 --> 06:03:32.790
TO THRIVE AND BRING JOBS TO

06:03:41.833 --> 06:03:43.201
CLARIFY A NUMBER OF OUTSTANDING

06:03:43.268 --> 06:03:45.036
ISSUES. WE HAVE HELD SOME

06:03:45.103 --> 06:03:45.937
MEETINGS WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON

06:03:46.004 --> 06:03:47.739
ALL SIDES TO GET TO THIS POINT.

06:03:47.805 --> 06:03:50.108
THE BILL ADDRESSES A NUMBER OF

06:03:50.175 --> 06:03:51.776
ISSUES, AND THOSE ISSUES INCLUDE

06:03:51.843 --> 06:03:53.611
THAT IT MAKES CLEAR THAT AB

06:03:53.678 --> 06:03:54.712
PROVISIONS DO NOT APPLY TO

06:03:54.779 --> 06:03:56.748
CERTAIN PROPERTIES OR

06:03:56.814 --> 06:03:58.616
AGRICULTURAL USES, PROVIDES MORE

06:03:58.683 --> 06:04:00.185
TIME FOR SMALL CITIES AND

06:04:00.251 --> 06:04:01.119
COUNTIES TO UPDATE THEIR

06:04:01.186 --> 06:04:03.321
CIRCULATION ELEMENT, AND IT ALSO

06:04:03.388 --> 06:04:04.189
GIVES THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

06:04:04.255 --> 06:04:05.857
DISCRETION TO WORK WITH LOCAL

06:04:05.924 --> 06:04:07.392
GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE WORKING IN

06:04:07.458 --> 06:04:10.295
GOOD FAITH TO COMPLY WITH AB 98.

06:04:10.361 --> 06:04:11.296
ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE AGREED ON

06:04:11.362 --> 06:04:12.564
AMENDMENTS THAT WILL BE TAKEN AS

06:04:12.630 --> 06:04:14.165
THE BILL MOVES THROUGH THE

06:04:14.232 --> 06:04:15.366
APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE AND

06:04:15.433 --> 06:04:17.802
THIS AMENDMENTS WILL CLARIFY THE

06:04:17.869 --> 06:04:19.404
DEFINITION OF TRUCK ENTRANCES.

06:04:19.470 --> 06:04:21.306
ALLOW LOGISTICS PARKS TO HAVE A

06:04:21.372 --> 06:04:23.808
SINGLE ENTRANCE. CLARIFY THE

06:04:23.875 --> 06:04:25.343
DEFINITION OF THE REQUIRED

06:04:25.410 --> 06:04:27.045
BUFFER ZONES. GIVE DIRECTION TO

06:04:27.111 --> 06:04:28.246
LOCAL PLANNING DEPARTMENTS ABOUT

06:04:28.313 --> 06:04:29.881
BUFFER ZONE AND BARRIER DESIGN

06:04:29.948 --> 06:04:31.983
STANDARDS. AND FINALLY, AND PUT

06:04:32.050 --> 06:04:34.686
TO BED THE ISSUE OF ENSURING

06:04:34.752 --> 06:04:35.353
THAT EXISTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING

06:04:35.420 --> 06:04:37.422
PROVISIONS ARE PRESERVED.

06:04:37.488 --> 06:04:38.056
ADDITIONALLY, WE'RE VERY CLOSE

06:04:38.122 --> 06:04:39.824
TO AN AGREEMENT ON GUARANTEEING

06:04:39.891 --> 06:04:41.426
THE EXISTING PIPELINE OF

06:04:41.492 --> 06:04:43.294
PROJECTS THAT ARE THAT IS

06:04:43.361 --> 06:04:44.596
PROJECTED AND PROVIDING

06:04:44.662 --> 06:04:46.197
ADDITIONAL CLARITY WITH REGARD

06:04:46.264 --> 06:04:48.233
TO DOCTOR ORIENTATION. THERE'S

06:04:48.299 --> 06:04:49.400
STILL A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT

06:04:49.467 --> 06:04:50.802
OUTSTANDING ISSUES THAT WE WILL

06:04:50.868 --> 06:04:53.137
BE WORKING THROUGH THE RECESS TO

06:04:53.204 --> 06:04:55.640
RESOLVE, AND THOSE ISSUES

06:04:55.707 --> 06:04:57.208
INCLUDE ENFORCEMENT OF TRUCK

06:04:57.275 --> 06:04:59.010
ROUTES, HOW EXISTING WAREHOUSES

06:04:59.077 --> 06:05:00.845
CAN BE MODERNIZED, AND THE ROLE

06:05:00.912 --> 06:05:03.114
THAT THE ATTORNEY WILL PLAY IN

06:05:03.181 --> 06:05:04.015
ENFORCEMENT, AND A COUPLE OF

06:05:04.082 --> 06:05:05.984
OTHER MINOR ISSUES THAT WE'RE

06:05:06.050 --> 06:05:08.186
WORKING ON. MY SINCERE HOPE IS

06:05:08.253 --> 06:05:10.021
THAT THERE ARE AT LEAST A FEW

06:05:10.088 --> 06:05:11.556
MORE ISSUES WE REACH CONSENSUS

06:05:11.623 --> 06:05:13.424
ON BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR.

06:05:13.491 --> 06:05:14.926
WE SPENT HUNDREDS OF HOURS THAT

06:05:14.993 --> 06:05:16.427
HAVE BEEN POURED INTO THIS, AND

06:05:16.494 --> 06:05:18.396
SO FAR AS YOU CAN SEE, WE STILL

06:05:18.463 --> 06:05:20.431
HAVE WORK TO DO. AS YOU KNOW,

06:05:20.498 --> 06:05:22.100
WITH ALL GOOD COMPROMISES, WE

06:05:22.166 --> 06:05:23.334
HAVE A VERY LITTLE FORMAL

06:05:23.401 --> 06:05:25.103
SUPPORT AND EVEN LESS FORMAL

06:05:25.169 --> 06:05:26.504
OPPOSITION. RATHER THAN HAVING

06:05:26.571 --> 06:05:28.373
TRADITIONAL WITNESSES HERE, I

06:05:28.439 --> 06:05:30.675
WOULD JUST ASK TO TAKE A MOMENT

06:05:30.742 --> 06:05:31.542
TO THANK ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS

06:05:31.609 --> 06:05:32.910
THAT HAVE COME FORWARD WITH

06:05:32.977 --> 06:05:34.212
THEIR CONCERNS AND THEIR IDEAS

06:05:34.279 --> 06:05:36.481
TO HELP US ENSURE WE GET THIS

06:05:36.547 --> 06:05:37.448
RIGHT. AND AGAIN, I DON'T HAVE

06:05:37.515 --> 06:05:38.383
ANY PRINCIPAL WITNESSES IN

06:05:38.449 --> 06:05:41.819
SUPPORT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. DO

06:05:41.886 --> 06:05:43.354
WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN

06:05:43.421 --> 06:05:46.791
SUPPORT? I THINK YOU'VE GOT ALL

06:05:46.858 --> 06:05:51.663
TWEENERS. ALL RIGHT. DO WE HAVE

06:05:51.729 --> 06:05:56.801
ANY? YES, PLEASE. MISTER CHAIR

06:05:56.868 --> 06:05:57.902
MEMBERS. MR. CARILLO, THANK YOU

06:05:57.969 --> 06:05:59.537
VERY MUCH. AS MANY. MATTHEW HAAG

06:05:59.604 --> 06:06:01.072
WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS

06:06:01.139 --> 06:06:02.573
PROPERTIES ASSOCIATION. I'M HERE

06:06:02.640 --> 06:06:03.975
TODAY REPRESENTING A COALITION

06:06:04.042 --> 06:06:06.377
OF ABOUT 50 ENTITIES THAT HAVE

06:06:06.444 --> 06:06:07.845
BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH

06:06:07.912 --> 06:06:09.681
SENATOR REYES AND ASSEMBLY

06:06:09.747 --> 06:06:11.215
MEMBER CARILLO TO TRY AND

06:06:11.282 --> 06:06:12.684
ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES

06:06:12.750 --> 06:06:14.519
LINGERING FROM AB 98. AS YOU

06:06:14.585 --> 06:06:16.921
KNOW, WE WERE ON THE WRONG SIDE

06:06:16.988 --> 06:06:18.690
OF A GUT AND AMEND LAST YEAR. A

06:06:18.756 --> 06:06:19.324
LOT OF TIMES WHEN SOMETHING IS

06:06:19.390 --> 06:06:21.959
DONE AT THE END OF SESSION,

06:06:22.026 --> 06:06:22.627
THERE ARE TECHNICAL ISSUES THAT

06:06:22.694 --> 06:06:24.495
NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. WE PULLED

06:06:24.562 --> 06:06:26.264
TOGETHER A VERY LONG LIST OF

06:06:26.331 --> 06:06:27.198
TECHNICAL ISSUES THAT WE'VE BEEN

06:06:27.265 --> 06:06:29.100
WORKING THROUGH WITH BOTH

06:06:29.167 --> 06:06:30.902
AUTHORS, AND TO THEIR CREDIT,

06:06:30.968 --> 06:06:32.804
THEY'VE BEEN VERY RECEPTIVE TO

06:06:32.870 --> 06:06:34.839
HEARING WHAT THE ISSUES ARE AND

06:06:34.906 --> 06:06:36.374
WORKING THROUGH THEM. MR.

06:06:36.441 --> 06:06:38.443
CARILLO OUTLINED REALLY THE

06:06:38.509 --> 06:06:40.378
REMAINING ISSUES THAT ARE LEFT,

06:06:40.445 --> 06:06:41.679
AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING

06:06:41.746 --> 06:06:44.015
WITH HIM, SENATOR REYES AND ALL

06:06:44.082 --> 06:06:45.616
THE STAFF WHO'VE BEEN WORKING ON

06:06:45.683 --> 06:06:47.585
THIS TO FIX IT. WE'RE NOT TRYING

06:06:47.652 --> 06:06:49.354
TO MOVE THE GOALPOST. WHAT WE'RE

06:06:49.420 --> 06:06:50.755
TRYING TO DO IS GET THIS TO A

06:06:50.822 --> 06:06:52.590
POINT WHERE AB 98 CAN BE

06:06:52.657 --> 06:06:53.691
IMPLEMENTED. WE ARE SEEING

06:06:53.758 --> 06:06:54.726
ALREADY SOME WAREHOUSES BEING

06:06:54.792 --> 06:06:56.861
HELD UP BECAUSE OF AB 98. BUT WE

06:06:56.928 --> 06:06:58.863
THINK IF WE CAN GET THIS DONE

06:06:58.930 --> 06:07:00.064
THIS YEAR, THAT THIS THING IS

06:07:00.131 --> 06:07:01.499
GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTABLE AND

06:07:01.566 --> 06:07:02.934
WILL BE MUCH HAPPIER THAN WE

06:07:03.000 --> 06:07:06.237
CURRENTLY ARE, THANK YOU VERY

06:07:06.304 --> 06:07:09.841
MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU.

06:07:09.907 --> 06:07:10.908
MELISSA SPARKS KRANZ WITH THE

06:07:10.975 --> 06:07:12.377
LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES. AND

06:07:12.443 --> 06:07:13.811
I JUST WANT TO ECHO AND THANK

06:07:13.878 --> 06:07:14.846
ASSEMBLYMEMBER CARILLO AND

06:07:14.912 --> 06:07:16.247
SENATOR REYES FOR THEIR

06:07:16.314 --> 06:07:17.648
CONTINUED DEDICATION ON THE

06:07:17.715 --> 06:07:21.319
CLEANUP. WE REPRESENT 483 CITIES

06:07:21.386 --> 06:07:22.687
THAT ARE MANDATED TO COMPLETE

06:07:22.754 --> 06:07:24.255
THE CIRCULATION ELEMENT AS

06:07:24.322 --> 06:07:26.724
REQUIRED IN AB 98, AND WE

06:07:26.791 --> 06:07:29.293
BELIEVE AND AGREE WITH WHAT WAS

06:07:29.360 --> 06:07:30.328
THE SENATE'S PRIORITY LAST YEAR,

06:07:30.395 --> 06:07:32.096
THAT THERE SHOULD BE OFF RAMPS

06:07:32.163 --> 06:07:33.564
FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO NOT

06:07:33.631 --> 06:07:34.999
HAVE TO DO THE CIRCULATION

06:07:35.066 --> 06:07:36.467
ELEMENT REQUIREMENTS IF THEY

06:07:36.534 --> 06:07:37.735
DON'T HAVE LARGE SCALE

06:07:37.802 --> 06:07:40.104
WAREHOUSES IN THEIR CITIES. AND

06:07:40.171 --> 06:07:41.839
WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THERE HAVE

06:07:41.906 --> 06:07:43.474
ALREADY BEEN CASES WHERE THE

06:07:43.541 --> 06:07:45.109
ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS INTERVENED

06:07:45.176 --> 06:07:46.878
IN SOME CITIES WITH LARGE SCALE

06:07:46.944 --> 06:07:48.546
WAREHOUSES, AND THEY HAVE

06:07:48.613 --> 06:07:50.882
PRESCRIPTIVE LOCAL ORDINANCES TO

06:07:50.948 --> 06:07:52.884
IMPLEMENT AND REGULATE THESE

06:07:52.950 --> 06:07:54.018
DEVELOPMENTS. AND WE BELIEVE

06:07:54.085 --> 06:07:56.120
THAT THERE SHOULD BE FLEXIBILITY

06:07:56.187 --> 06:07:57.054
FOR CITIES TO ALSO ACHIEVE THE

06:07:57.121 --> 06:07:59.457
GOALS OF AB 98, ENSURE IT IS

06:07:59.524 --> 06:08:00.425
IMPLEMENTED, WHETHER IT BE

06:08:00.491 --> 06:08:02.226
THROUGH THE CIRCULATION ELEMENT

06:08:02.293 --> 06:08:04.362
UPDATE OR A LOCAL ORDINANCE.

06:08:04.429 --> 06:08:05.229
THAT WOULD CREATE SOME

06:08:05.296 --> 06:08:07.031
FLEXIBILITY FOR OUR LOCAL

06:08:07.098 --> 06:08:08.166
GOVERNMENTS. AND LASTLY, WE DO

06:08:08.232 --> 06:08:09.867
HAVE REMAINING CONCERNS WITH THE

06:08:09.934 --> 06:08:12.136
ATTORNEY GENERAL EXPANDED

06:08:12.203 --> 06:08:13.838
LANGUAGE THAT'S IN THE BILL NOW.

06:08:13.905 --> 06:08:16.741
IT ACTUALLY ALLOWS COST RECOVERY

06:08:16.808 --> 06:08:18.209
OF ATTORNEY GENERAL

06:08:18.276 --> 06:08:19.277
INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION

06:08:19.343 --> 06:08:21.379
COSTS ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, IN

06:08:21.446 --> 06:08:22.947
ADDITION TO THE $50,000 FINE FOR

06:08:23.014 --> 06:08:24.715
NOT COMPLETING THE CIRCULATION

06:08:24.782 --> 06:08:26.184
ELEMENT. THAT'S EVERY SIX

06:08:26.250 --> 06:08:28.186
MONTHS. FINE. SO WE ARE WORKING

06:08:28.252 --> 06:08:30.488
WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER CARILLO AND

06:08:30.555 --> 06:08:31.556
REALLY WORKING DILIGENTLY TO

06:08:31.622 --> 06:08:33.257
ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS. AND WE

06:08:33.324 --> 06:08:35.827
DO APPRECIATE THE EFFORT ON ALL

06:08:35.893 --> 06:08:39.864
PARTS. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

06:08:39.931 --> 06:08:40.865
MARK NEWBERGER WITH THE

06:08:40.932 --> 06:08:42.266
CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF

AUTHOR AND THE STAFF FOR ALL

06:08:51.075 --> 06:08:52.777
THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL.

06:08:52.844 --> 06:08:54.779
HOWEVER, WE STILL HAVE A VARIETY

06:08:54.846 --> 06:08:56.013
OF CONCERNS REMAINING THAT WE'RE

06:08:56.080 --> 06:08:57.782
HOPEFUL WILL BE TAKEN CARE OF

06:08:57.849 --> 06:08:58.816
THROUGH FUTURE AMENDMENTS. THANK

06:08:58.883 --> 06:08:59.984
YOU, MR. CHAIR, AND MEMBERS.

06:09:00.051 --> 06:09:01.118
LAUREN VALENCIA, REPRESENTING

06:09:01.185 --> 06:09:02.820
THE AMERICAN PLANNING

06:09:02.887 --> 06:09:05.056

06:09:05.122 --> 06:09:06.390
RESPONSIBLE FOR UPDATING THE

06:09:06.457 --> 06:09:08.292
CIRCULATION ELEMENT AND

06:09:08.359 --> 06:09:09.727
COMPLYING WITH AB 98

06:09:09.794 --> 06:09:10.962
REQUIREMENTS. AND WE DO REALLY

06:09:11.028 --> 06:09:11.596
THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER CARRILLO,

06:09:11.662 --> 06:09:13.264
SENATOR REYES, STAFF AND

06:09:13.331 --> 06:09:14.332
EVERYBODY FOR THE CONVERSATIONS

06:09:14.398 --> 06:09:16.567
ON THIS BILL. I WOULD ECHO THE

06:09:16.634 --> 06:09:17.935
COMMENTS OUTLINED BY MY

06:09:18.002 --> 06:09:19.103
COLLEAGUE AT CAL CITIES, BUT

06:09:19.170 --> 06:09:21.839
JUST WANT TO ADD TO THAT, OUR

06:09:21.906 --> 06:09:22.507
MEMBERS REALLY WANT TO IMPLEMENT

06:09:22.573 --> 06:09:24.408
THE BILL AB 98, IN A WAY THAT IS

06:09:24.475 --> 06:09:25.309
FEASIBLE AND MEANINGFUL, MEETING

06:09:25.376 --> 06:09:27.345
THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW. AND SO

06:09:27.411 --> 06:09:28.746
THAT IS WHY WE HAVE SUGGESTED

06:09:28.813 --> 06:09:30.448
THAT WE DO BELIEVE AN ORDINANCE

06:09:30.515 --> 06:09:31.582
VERSUS A GENERAL PLAN UPDATE

06:09:31.649 --> 06:09:33.050
WOULD REALLY ACHIEVE THAT. AND

06:09:33.117 --> 06:09:35.286
SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING

06:09:35.353 --> 06:09:36.888
THOSE CONVERSATIONS. BUT WE DO

06:09:36.954 --> 06:09:38.656
THINK WE'RE AT A CRITICAL

06:09:38.723 --> 06:09:39.090
JUNCTURE HERE IN THE

06:09:39.156 --> 06:09:40.391
LEGISLATURE. AND TIMING IS KEY.

06:09:40.458 --> 06:09:41.893
AND OUR MEMBERS ARE REALLY

06:09:41.959 --> 06:09:42.994
LOOKING TO US TO SEE HOW THEY'RE

06:09:43.060 --> 06:09:45.363
GOING TO IMPLEMENT AB 98. SO

06:09:45.429 --> 06:09:46.664
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE

06:09:46.731 --> 06:09:48.566

06:11:11.349 --> 06:11:13.517
TO RAISE MY HAND, BUT I WILL SAY

06:11:13.584 --> 06:11:14.852
I APPRECIATE THE CHAIR FOR THE

06:11:14.919 --> 06:11:17.488
WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE ON THIS,

06:11:17.555 --> 06:11:20.291

KNOW THAT YOU GUYS WILL GET TO

06:11:21.959 --> 06:11:24.395
WHERE WE NEED TO LAND TO BE SURE

06:11:24.462 --> 06:11:26.430
THAT WE HAVE THE PROPER CLEANUP

06:11:26.497 --> 06:11:27.098
LANGUAGE AND RECOGNIZING

06:11:27.164 --> 06:11:29.300
MODERNIZATION. SO THANK YOU.

APPRECIATE THE HARD WORK THAT

06:11:35.506 --> 06:11:37.274
CHAIR HAS PUT INTO THIS. I KNOW

06:11:37.341 --> 06:11:39.910
IT'S BEEN ACTUALLY MORE THAN TWO

06:11:39.977 --> 06:11:42.146
YEARS. IT'S HE'S PUT IT ON TWO

06:11:42.213 --> 06:11:44.815
YEARS AGO. THIS HAS BEEN IN OUR

06:11:44.882 --> 06:11:46.617
FOR ACTUALLY ACTUALLY ALMOST

06:11:46.684 --> 06:11:48.486
FIVE YEARS. BUT I KNOW THIS

06:11:48.552 --> 06:11:50.621
ISSUE HAS BEEN LINGERING FOR A

06:11:50.688 --> 06:11:52.390
LONG TIME. AND I APPRECIATE ALL

06:11:52.456 --> 06:11:54.325
THE WILLINGNESS TO WORK. AND I

06:11:54.392 --> 06:11:55.292
KNOW THAT THERE'S SOME ISSUES

06:11:55.359 --> 06:11:57.361
THAT THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED,

06:11:57.428 --> 06:11:59.163
FOR EXAMPLE, TO ALIGN WAREHOUSES

06:11:59.230 --> 06:12:00.297
CONSTRUCTED PRIOR TO THE

06:12:00.364 --> 06:12:02.433
IMPLEMENTATION OF AB 98 TO BE

06:12:02.500 --> 06:12:04.669
MODERNIZED AND CLARIFY THAT THE

06:12:04.735 --> 06:12:06.470
PROJECT APPROVED BEFORE AB 98 IS

06:12:06.537 --> 06:12:07.872
ENACTMENT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO ITS

06:12:07.938 --> 06:12:09.140
REQUIREMENTS. AND I WANT TO BE

06:12:09.206 --> 06:12:10.107
VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT THAT,

06:12:10.174 --> 06:12:11.976
BECAUSE I THINK THAT WAS THE

06:12:12.043 --> 06:12:12.977
COMPROMISE THAT WAS REACHED. I

06:12:13.044 --> 06:12:14.879
KNOW YOU WILL DO EVERYTHING

06:12:14.945 --> 06:12:15.780
POSSIBLE, BUT I JUST WANT TO

06:12:15.846 --> 06:12:18.049
MAKE SURE THAT, YOU KNOW, THOSE

06:12:18.115 --> 06:12:19.216
IN OPPOSITION TO KNOW THAT WE

06:12:19.283 --> 06:12:21.185
ARE HE'S WORKING ON IT, BUT

06:12:21.252 --> 06:12:22.186
WE'RE ALSO WELL AWARE OF WHAT

06:12:22.253 --> 06:12:24.522
NEEDS TO BE DONE. SO I REALLY

06:12:24.588 --> 06:12:25.790
APPRECIATE ALL OF THE WORK.

06:12:25.856 --> 06:12:26.891
THANK YOU FOR THAT,

06:12:26.957 --> 06:12:29.160
ASSEMBLYMEMBER RUBIO, ASSEMBLY

06:12:29.226 --> 06:12:31.262
MEMBER RANSOM, YOU ARE

06:12:31.328 --> 06:12:33.097
RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU SIR. OKAY.

06:12:33.164 --> 06:12:34.932
AND I'M SORRY TO BREAK UP THE

06:12:34.999 --> 06:12:37.868
LOVE FEST. MY COMMUNITY PRETTY

06:12:37.935 --> 06:12:39.570
MUCH LED THE OPPOSITION OF AB

06:12:39.637 --> 06:12:42.440
98. WE ARE A BASICALLY A

06:12:42.506 --> 06:12:43.507
TRANSPORTATION LOGISTICS HUB,

06:12:43.574 --> 06:12:47.078
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD JOBS, AND IT

06:12:47.144 --> 06:12:48.612
LEADS ME TO A COUPLE OF

06:12:48.679 --> 06:12:50.681
QUESTIONS. AND IF YOU WOULD

06:12:50.748 --> 06:12:52.817
HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO INDULGE ME.

06:12:52.883 --> 06:12:55.152
SO THE BILL BASICALLY THE

06:12:55.219 --> 06:12:57.221
QUESTION IS ABOUT THE ABILITY TO

06:12:57.288 --> 06:12:58.522
ALLOW THE CIRCULATION OF TRUCK

06:12:58.589 --> 06:13:00.057
ROUTE REQUIREMENTS TO BE

06:13:00.124 --> 06:13:01.525
COMPLETED IN A LOCAL ORDINANCE

06:13:01.592 --> 06:13:03.694
RATHER THAN THE GENERAL PLAN.

06:13:03.761 --> 06:13:05.896
ONE OF MY CITIES ALREADY AGREED

06:13:05.963 --> 06:13:07.331
TO A SETTLEMENT WITH AG WITH THE

06:13:07.398 --> 06:13:08.332
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE, AND

06:13:08.399 --> 06:13:09.567
DEVELOPED A LOCAL ORDINANCE TO

06:13:09.633 --> 06:13:10.901
ADDRESS THE WAREHOUSE

06:13:10.968 --> 06:13:13.404
DEVELOPMENT. BEFORE, YOU KNOW,

06:13:13.471 --> 06:13:15.473
WITH BEFORE AB 98. AND SINCE

06:13:15.539 --> 06:13:17.108
THAT BILL WAS SIGNED, THERE'S

06:13:17.174 --> 06:13:19.777
ALSO A REQUIREMENT TO DO A

06:13:19.844 --> 06:13:22.413
CIRCULATION ELEMENT $50,000

06:13:22.480 --> 06:13:26.317
FINE, $50,000, SIX MONTHS AND A

06:13:26.383 --> 06:13:28.119
FINE. SO JUST KIND OF WONDERING

06:13:28.185 --> 06:13:32.289
IF A CITY HAS TO UPDATE, YOU

06:13:32.356 --> 06:13:33.557
KNOW, COMPONENT OF THEIR GENERAL

06:13:33.624 --> 06:13:35.659
PLAN. WOULD THIS THEN TRIGGER

06:13:35.726 --> 06:13:37.495
OTHER GENERAL PLAN REQUIREMENTS,

06:13:37.561 --> 06:13:39.296
OR COULD IT JUST BE ADDRESSED IN

06:13:39.363 --> 06:13:41.766
THE ORDINANCE? THE CONVERSATIONS

06:13:41.832 --> 06:13:44.769
LED US TO AGREE ON THAT BEING

06:13:44.835 --> 06:13:46.170
ADDRESSED THROUGH OUR LOCAL

06:13:46.237 --> 06:13:47.938
ORDINANCE. AT THE BEGINNING,

06:13:48.005 --> 06:13:51.509
WHAT WE HAD PROPOSED AS THE

06:13:51.575 --> 06:13:53.110
MECHANISM FOR LOCAL

06:13:53.177 --> 06:13:54.812
JURISDICTIONS TO ADDRESS THE

06:13:54.879 --> 06:13:57.047
CIRCULATION ELEMENT, REALIZING

06:13:57.114 --> 06:13:58.282
THAT SOME CITIES WERE WORKING

06:13:58.349 --> 06:13:59.850
THROUGH THE GENERAL PLAN UPDATE,

06:13:59.917 --> 06:14:01.252
WHICH INCLUDED A CIRCULATION

06:14:01.318 --> 06:14:02.686
ELEMENT, THAT WAS ONE OF THE

06:14:02.753 --> 06:14:04.922
CONCERNS THAT THE PLANNING

06:14:04.989 --> 06:14:05.923
AMERICAN ASSOCIATION BROUGHT UP

06:14:05.990 --> 06:14:08.292
TO US, WHICH IS A VALID CONCERN.

06:14:08.359 --> 06:14:09.226
UPDATING THE GENERAL PLAN TAKES

06:14:09.293 --> 06:14:12.830
A LOT OF TIME AND IT CAN BE VERY

06:14:12.897 --> 06:14:13.364
COSTLY. THAT'S WHERE THE

06:14:13.430 --> 06:14:14.565
CONVERSATION STARTED. SO WE

06:14:14.632 --> 06:14:17.535
AGREE THAT MAYBE ADDRESSING THAT

06:14:17.601 --> 06:14:18.869
REQUIREMENT THROUGH A LOCAL

06:14:18.936 --> 06:14:20.771
ORDINANCE WOULD MAKE MUCH MORE

06:14:20.838 --> 06:14:22.907
SENSE. THAT'S WHERE WE ARE RIGHT

06:14:22.973 --> 06:14:25.342
NOW. AND AGAIN, WE ARE HAPPY TO

06:14:25.409 --> 06:14:25.943
CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS.

06:14:26.010 --> 06:14:27.645
BUT IN IN THE SPIRIT OF

06:14:27.711 --> 06:14:28.779
COLLABORATING WITH THOSE CITIES

06:14:28.846 --> 06:14:31.515
THAT WENT THROUGH A GENERAL PLAN

06:14:31.582 --> 06:14:33.384
UPDATE RECENTLY, THEY DON'T HAVE

06:14:33.450 --> 06:14:34.752
TO GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN. AND

06:14:34.819 --> 06:14:36.821
THEN DOING A CIRCULATION ELEMENT

06:14:36.887 --> 06:14:39.323
IS ALSO EXPENSIVE. SO THE OPTION

06:14:39.390 --> 06:14:40.925
OF HAVING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BE

06:14:40.991 --> 06:14:42.760
ABLE TO ADDRESS IT THROUGH AN

06:14:42.827 --> 06:14:44.195
ORDINANCE WHICH IS A MUCH

06:14:44.261 --> 06:14:45.196
EASIER, MUCH FASTER PROJECT. SO

06:14:45.262 --> 06:14:47.231
THAT'S WHERE THE COMPROMISE CAME

06:14:47.298 --> 06:14:48.799
IN. OKAY. THANK YOU FOR THAT.

06:14:48.866 --> 06:14:51.735
AND THEN CAN YOU SPEAK TO CLEAN

06:14:51.802 --> 06:14:55.306
UP THE CLEANUP OF PROVIDING OFF

06:14:55.372 --> 06:14:56.707
RAMPS FOR CIRCULATION ELEMENTS

06:14:56.774 --> 06:14:57.942
FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHO AREN'T

06:14:58.008 --> 06:14:59.777
GOING TO APPROVE WAREHOUSES IN

06:14:59.844 --> 06:15:02.446
THEIR DISTRICT? THAT'S ANOTHER

06:15:02.513 --> 06:15:05.382
ONE THAT WE SERIOUSLY CONSIDER,

06:15:05.449 --> 06:15:06.884
AS MENTIONED BY ONE OF THE

06:15:06.951 --> 06:15:08.252
SPEAKERS, CITIES THAT DON'T HAVE

06:15:08.319 --> 06:15:10.387
THE ROOM FOR THE INDUSTRIAL

06:15:10.454 --> 06:15:11.889
DEVELOPMENT, CITIES THAT COME TO

06:15:11.956 --> 06:15:13.457
MIND RIGHT AWAY IN SOUTHERN

06:15:13.524 --> 06:15:14.725
CALIFORNIA, CITY OF BEVERLY

06:15:14.792 --> 06:15:16.894
HILLS, SAN MARINO, BESIDES

06:15:16.961 --> 06:15:18.963
ALREADY BEING URBANIZED, NOT

06:15:19.029 --> 06:15:21.065
MORE VACANT LAND IS AVAILABLE.

06:15:21.131 --> 06:15:23.367
MAYBE NOT EVEN INDUSTRIAL ZONE

06:15:23.434 --> 06:15:25.135
DESIGNATIONS IN THOSE CITIES AND

06:15:25.202 --> 06:15:25.970
OTHERS. SO THAT'S PART OF THE

06:15:26.036 --> 06:15:28.205
OFF RAMP FOR THOSE CITIES THAT

06:15:28.272 --> 06:15:30.875
DON'T HAVE THE LOGISTICS USE IN

06:15:30.941 --> 06:15:32.243
MIND, BECAUSE EITHER THEY DON'T

06:15:32.309 --> 06:15:34.178
HAVE ANY MORE LAND TO DO THAT.

06:15:34.245 --> 06:15:35.212
THE OTHER CONCERN, OBVIOUSLY, IS

06:15:35.279 --> 06:15:37.815
THE COST OF REAL ESTATE. RIGHT?

06:15:37.882 --> 06:15:39.984
SO THOSE CITIES THAT EVEN IF

06:15:40.050 --> 06:15:42.052
THEY HAD THE LAND AVAILABLE, IT

06:15:42.119 --> 06:15:44.221
WOULD BE SO EXPENSIVE AND THE

06:15:44.288 --> 06:15:45.089
INDUSTRY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GO

06:15:45.155 --> 06:15:46.290
THERE BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T MAKE

06:15:46.357 --> 06:15:49.326
SENSE FOR THEM TO DO THAT. SO

06:15:49.393 --> 06:15:50.694
THAT'S ONE OF THE OFF RAMPS, SO

06:15:50.761 --> 06:15:51.495
THAT THOSE CITIES THAT EITHER,

06:15:51.562 --> 06:15:52.663
AGAIN, ARE ALREADY ORGANIZED

06:15:52.730 --> 06:15:54.832
WITHIN A MORE VACANT LAND THAT

06:15:54.899 --> 06:15:57.468
WOULD ALLOW THEM TO NOT HAVE TO

06:15:57.534 --> 06:15:59.770
COMPLY WITH 98 OR, YOU KNOW, THE

06:15:59.837 --> 06:16:01.538
NEW BILLS THAT WERE PROCESSING

06:16:01.605 --> 06:16:06.777
NOW, AB 735, OSB 744 15 SO THOSE

06:16:06.844 --> 06:16:08.746
ARE KIND OF THE WAYS THAT WE

06:16:08.812 --> 06:16:09.380
ADDRESS WE'RE ADDRESSING THOSE

06:16:09.446 --> 06:16:10.915
CONCERNS. AND AGAIN, THOSE

06:16:10.981 --> 06:16:12.316
CONVERSATIONS ARE STILL GOING

06:16:12.383 --> 06:16:13.817
ON. OKAY. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE

06:16:13.884 --> 06:16:16.353
SURE I CAN REPORT BACK PROPERLY

06:16:16.420 --> 06:16:17.621
THAT LOOK, IF YOU ARE NOT GOING
