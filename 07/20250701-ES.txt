THE COMMITTEE. GOOD AFTERNOON.

00:35:33.631 --> 00:35:37.034
AND BEGINNING WITH SB 328, I

00:35:37.101 --> 00:35:38.903
WOULD CONSIDER A NECESSARY BILL

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:40.204
THAT WOULD HELP PREVENT

00:35:40.271 --> 00:35:42.106
SIGNIFICANT COST INCREASES FOR

00:35:42.173 --> 00:35:43.441
HOUSING DEVELOPERS WHO HAVE

00:35:43.508 --> 00:35:45.576
REMEDIATED CONTAMINATED SOIL AND

00:35:45.643 --> 00:35:47.144
RETURNED THE LAND BACK TO

00:35:47.211 --> 00:35:49.914
PRODUCTIVE USE IN 2022. THE

00:35:49.981 --> 00:35:52.950
LEGISLATURE PASSED SB 158, A

00:35:53.017 --> 00:35:54.986
BUDGET TRAILER BILL THAT HAD THE

00:35:55.052 --> 00:35:56.954
GOAL OF STABILIZING THE BUDGET

00:35:57.021 --> 00:35:58.322
FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC

00:35:58.389 --> 00:36:00.725
SUBSTANCE CONTROL. WE KNOW AS

00:36:00.791 --> 00:36:02.193
DTSC. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THIS,

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:04.762
SB 158 MADE CHANGES TO ONE OF

00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:07.331
THE MAJOR FEES THAT ARE PAID TO

00:36:07.398 --> 00:36:09.500
DTSC WHEN REMEDIATING A SITE.

00:36:09.567 --> 00:36:12.336
BEFORE SB 158, DTSC USED A

00:36:12.403 --> 00:36:14.805
TIERED MODEL WITH A FEE THAT

00:36:14.872 --> 00:36:16.841
RANGED DEPENDING ON THE PROJECT.

00:36:16.908 --> 00:36:19.477
THE FEES WERE ALSO CAPPED AT

00:36:19.544 --> 00:36:20.878
$100,000 FOR MOST HOUSING

00:36:20.945 --> 00:36:22.713
PROJECTS. HOWEVER, THIS MODEL

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:24.549
WAS REPLACED WITH A FIXED PRICE

00:36:24.615 --> 00:36:28.886
PER TON MODEL OF $46.20 PER TON.

00:36:28.953 --> 00:36:30.187
THESE CHANGES TO THE HAZARDOUS

00:36:30.254 --> 00:36:32.690
WASTE GENERATOR FEE HAVE HAD A

00:36:32.757 --> 00:36:34.125
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON

00:36:34.191 --> 00:36:35.326
DEVELOPMENT, AND HAVE INCREASED

00:36:35.393 --> 00:36:37.461
COSTS FOR SEVERAL ESSENTIAL

00:36:37.528 --> 00:36:38.396
HOUSING PROJECTS AND PROJECTS

00:36:38.462 --> 00:36:40.364
THAT PROVIDE COMMUNITY

00:36:40.431 --> 00:36:41.732
DEVELOPMENT. THIS FEE

00:36:41.799 --> 00:36:42.867
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE COST

00:36:42.934 --> 00:36:44.669
OF REMEDIATING CONTAMINATED SOIL

00:36:44.735 --> 00:36:47.104
IN URBAN INFILL SITES, OR IN

00:36:47.171 --> 00:36:48.205
SITUATIONS WHERE DEVELOPERS

00:36:48.272 --> 00:36:49.740
ENCOUNTERED NATURALLY OCCURRING

00:36:49.807 --> 00:36:52.243
TOXIC MATERIALS. FOR INSTANCE, A

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:54.045
HOUSING PROJECT IN SAN FRANCISCO

00:36:54.111 --> 00:36:59.450
SAW THEIR FEES RISE FROM

00:36:59.517 --> 00:37:00.217
$100,000 TO $800,000. THE

00:37:00.284 --> 00:37:01.919
INCREASED FEE WAS MADE SEVERAL

00:37:01.986 --> 00:37:04.088
HAS MADE SEVERAL PROJECTS IN

00:37:04.155 --> 00:37:05.623
INFEASIBLE. AT A TIME WHERE

00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:06.824
CALIFORNIA IS ALREADY STRUGGLING

00:37:06.891 --> 00:37:09.193
WITH RISING COSTS. SO TO HELP

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:11.629
PROVIDE RELIEF AND REDUCE COSTS

00:37:11.696 --> 00:37:13.598
FOR THOSE, OR AT LEAST FOR THESE

00:37:13.664 --> 00:37:15.299
IMPORTANT AND ESSENTIAL HOUSING

00:37:15.366 --> 00:37:18.035
PROJECTS, SB 328 WOULD ESTABLISH

00:37:18.102 --> 00:37:19.503
A CAP ON HAZARDOUS WASTE

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:21.739
GENERATOR FEE AT $100,000 PER

00:37:21.806 --> 00:37:24.342
PROJECT PER YEAR FOR INFILL

00:37:24.408 --> 00:37:27.044
PROJECTS, AND 250,000 PER

00:37:27.111 --> 00:37:28.913
PROJECT PER YEAR FOR MASTER

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:31.649
DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. THIS BILL

00:37:31.716 --> 00:37:33.250
WOULD ALSO PLACE TIMELINES ON

00:37:33.317 --> 00:37:35.086
DTSC FOR RESPONDING TO

00:37:35.152 --> 00:37:36.954
DEVELOPMENT RELATED ACTIONS TO

00:37:37.021 --> 00:37:38.623
HELP PREVENT DELAYS IN THE

00:37:38.689 --> 00:37:40.524
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. NOW, AT A

00:37:40.591 --> 00:37:42.193
TIME WHEN CALIFORNIA IS FACING

00:37:42.259 --> 00:37:44.028
INCREASED DEVELOPMENT COSTS, WE

00:37:44.095 --> 00:37:45.896
MUST DO WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO

00:37:45.963 --> 00:37:47.231
CREATE A MORE FAVORABLE

00:37:47.298 --> 00:37:48.366
ENVIRONMENT THAT ALLOWS US TO

00:37:48.432 --> 00:37:50.901
BUILD HOUSING THAT'S AFFORDABLE,

00:37:50.968 --> 00:37:53.204
BUILDERS WHO ARE REPURPOSING AND

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:54.772
BUILDERS WHO ARE REPURPOSING

00:37:54.839 --> 00:37:56.607
LAND FOR PRODUCTIVE USE SHOULD

00:37:56.674 --> 00:37:58.843
NOT BE PENALIZED, ESPECIALLY

00:37:58.909 --> 00:38:00.411
THOSE REMEDIATING POLLUTION

00:38:00.478 --> 00:38:02.747
RATHER THAN ACTUALLY CAUSING IT.

00:38:02.813 --> 00:38:05.216
SB 328 WOULD PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED

00:38:05.282 --> 00:38:07.051
RELIEF AT A TIME WHERE COSTS ARE

00:38:07.118 --> 00:38:09.286
CONSTANTLY INCREASING. AND WITH

00:38:09.353 --> 00:38:11.455
THAT, I THREW THE CHAIR WILL

00:38:11.522 --> 00:38:13.891
HAVE WITNESSES SELF INTRODUCE.

00:38:13.958 --> 00:38:17.028
THANK YOU SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON

00:38:17.094 --> 00:38:18.496
MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. MY

00:38:18.562 --> 00:38:19.997
NAME IS LOUIS MERANTE. I'M HERE

00:38:20.064 --> 00:38:21.599
ON BEHALF OF THE BAY AREA

00:38:21.666 --> 00:38:23.000
COUNCIL, ONE OF THE BILL'S

00:38:23.067 --> 00:38:24.001
SUPPORTERS AND SPONSORS. THE BAY

00:38:24.068 --> 00:38:25.936
AREA COUNCIL REPRESENTS ABOUT

00:38:26.003 --> 00:38:27.238
350 OF THE REGION'S LARGEST

00:38:27.304 --> 00:38:28.639
EMPLOYERS, INCLUDING MANY OF THE

00:38:28.706 --> 00:38:30.141
DEVELOPERS WHO ARE DOING THESE

00:38:30.207 --> 00:38:31.175
TYPES OF IMPORTANT INFILL

00:38:31.242 --> 00:38:32.843
DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. THIS BILL

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:34.445
WOULD HELP US MEET OUR INFILL

00:38:34.512 --> 00:38:36.380
HOUSING GOALS. IT WOULD LEAD TO

00:38:36.447 --> 00:38:38.416
CLEANING UP MORE POLLUTION BY

00:38:38.482 --> 00:38:39.817
CAPPING THE GENERATION AND

00:38:39.884 --> 00:38:42.353
HANDLING FEE CHARGED BY DTSC FOR

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:43.754
RESIDENTIAL INFILL HOUSING AND

00:38:43.821 --> 00:38:46.357
MASTER DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. IN

00:38:46.424 --> 00:38:47.658
2021, THE LEGISLATURE REMOVED

00:38:47.725 --> 00:38:49.493
THE CAP ON THIS FEE, WHICH

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:51.729
RESULTED IN UNEXPECTEDLY LARGE

00:38:51.796 --> 00:38:53.564
FEES FOR MANY OF MY MEMBERS,

00:38:53.631 --> 00:38:54.799
STOPPING SOME OF THEIR PROJECTS

00:38:54.865 --> 00:38:57.034
IN THE IN THEIR TRACKS. TO BE

00:38:57.101 --> 00:38:58.235
CLEAR, THESE PROJECTS HAVE IN

00:38:58.302 --> 00:39:00.671
THE PAST AND WILL IN THE FUTURE

00:39:00.738 --> 00:39:03.674
PAID FOR THE REMEDIATION OF THE

00:39:03.741 --> 00:39:05.009
SOIL. THAT'S A QUESTION. THIS

00:39:05.076 --> 00:39:07.578
FEE IS FOR DTSC TO MONITOR AND

00:39:07.645 --> 00:39:08.813
VERIFY THAT THAT CLEANUP IS

00:39:08.879 --> 00:39:11.215
BEING DONE. WE WORRY THAT AN

00:39:11.282 --> 00:39:12.717
UNCAPPED FEE WILL PUSH HOUSING

00:39:12.783 --> 00:39:14.585
AWAY FROM OUR URBAN AREAS AND

00:39:14.652 --> 00:39:16.554
CAUSE LESS SOIL REMEDIATION TO

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:19.156
OCCUR, LEAVING OUR COMMUNITIES

00:39:19.223 --> 00:39:20.958
CONTINUALLY POLLUTED. THIS BILL

00:39:21.025 --> 00:39:22.560
ALSO APPLIES KEY PRINCIPLES FROM

00:39:22.626 --> 00:39:24.528
THE STATE'S PERMIT STREAMLINING

00:39:24.595 --> 00:39:27.064
ACT TO THE CLEAN TO EXCUSE ME TO

00:39:27.131 --> 00:39:29.700
THE CLEANUP REVIEW PROCESS. FOR

00:39:29.767 --> 00:39:31.135
EXAMPLE, THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE

00:39:31.202 --> 00:39:32.369
DTSC TO REVIEW AND PROVIDE

00:39:32.436 --> 00:39:33.471
INITIAL RESPONSE TO CLEANUP

00:39:33.537 --> 00:39:36.073
PLANS WITHIN 60 DAYS OR 120

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:37.975
DAYS, DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF

00:39:38.042 --> 00:39:39.310
THE PROJECT. DTSC WOULD INCLUDE

00:39:39.376 --> 00:39:41.078
IN THIS RESPONSE THEIR REQUEST

00:39:41.145 --> 00:39:42.246

00:39:42.313 --> 00:39:43.581
OTHER RELEVANT TIMELINES THAT

00:39:43.647 --> 00:39:45.683
THE PROJECT WILL BE EXPECTED TO

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:46.784
MEET. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE

00:39:46.851 --> 00:39:48.152
CHANGES STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE

00:39:48.219 --> 00:39:49.787
BETWEEN ALLOWING DTSC TO COVER

00:39:49.854 --> 00:39:51.455
THE COSTS OF THEIR IMPORTANT

00:39:51.522 --> 00:39:52.389
WORK, WHILE ALLOWING IMPORTANT

00:40:39.036 --> 00:40:41.605
AUGUST OF 2023. èC LAW SF,

00:40:41.672 --> 00:40:43.374
FORMERLY KNOWN AS UC HASTINGS,

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:44.475
WHICH IS A PUBLIC INDEPENDENT

00:40:44.542 --> 00:40:46.143
LAW SCHOOL, OPENED A MIXED USE

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:48.379
BUILDING THAT PROVIDES 656

00:40:48.445 --> 00:40:50.881
HOUSING UNITS FOR STUDENTS. SITE

00:40:50.948 --> 00:40:52.016
PREPARATION FOR THE PROJECT

00:40:52.082 --> 00:40:53.517
RESULTED IN THE DISPOSAL OF

00:40:53.584 --> 00:40:55.286
HAZARDOUS WASTE, APPROXIMATELY

00:40:55.352 --> 00:40:59.190
89 TONS IN WINTER OF 2020 AND

00:40:59.256 --> 00:41:04.161
2400 TONS IN 2021. IN 2021, UC

00:41:04.228 --> 00:41:10.067
LAW PAID A $104,932 FEE TO

00:41:10.134 --> 00:41:13.137
VERIFY THE REMEDIATION. IN 2022,

00:41:13.204 --> 00:41:14.672
THEY RECEIVED WHAT WAS FIRST

00:41:14.738 --> 00:41:16.106
BELIEVED TO BE AN ERRONEOUS

00:41:16.173 --> 00:41:17.875
DOUBLE BILLING, BUT ENDED UP

00:41:17.942 --> 00:41:19.376
BEING ADDITIONAL FEES FOR THE

00:41:19.443 --> 00:41:20.711
SAME WASTE ALREADY ASSESSED AND

00:41:20.778 --> 00:41:23.180
PAID FOR THIS TIME. UNDER THE

00:41:23.247 --> 00:41:26.217
NEW 2022 STRUCTURE, THE

00:41:26.283 --> 00:41:31.222
ADDITIONAL FEE TOTALING 117 445,

00:41:31.288 --> 00:41:35.860
WAS COUPLED WITH A $21,814 FEE

00:41:35.926 --> 00:41:38.095
IN PENALTIES AND INTEREST, FOR A

00:41:38.162 --> 00:41:41.432
GRAND TOTAL OF OVER $240,000.

00:41:41.498 --> 00:41:43.434
THE NEW FEE WAS PASSED WEEKS

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:45.669
BEFORE UC LAW CEASED GENERATING.

00:41:45.736 --> 00:41:48.005
THERE WAS NO WAY THEY COULD HAVE

00:41:48.072 --> 00:41:49.373
PLANNED FOR IT WHEN UNDERWRITING

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:50.674
THE HOUSING PROJECT. WHILE THE

00:41:50.741 --> 00:41:52.176
PROJECT ITSELF WAS PRIVATELY

00:41:52.243 --> 00:41:53.510
FINANCED, MOST MOST OF THE

00:41:53.577 --> 00:41:55.212
STUDENT BODY RECEIVES AID AND

00:41:55.279 --> 00:41:57.147
EVERY RESIDENT PAYS RENT,

00:41:57.214 --> 00:41:58.916
MEANING SOME OF THESE COSTS ARE

00:41:58.983 --> 00:42:00.918
BORNE BY THE TAXPAYER DOLLARS.

00:42:00.985 --> 00:42:02.186
WE SURVEYED OUR MEMBERS AND

00:42:02.253 --> 00:42:04.655
PAYING AN ADDITIONAL ADDITIONAL

00:42:04.722 --> 00:42:06.257
$600,000 IN FEES WAS REPORTED TO

00:42:06.323 --> 00:42:08.359
BE A REGULAR OCCURRENCE. THE

00:42:08.425 --> 00:42:10.194
ISSUE IS NOT SIMPLY THE FEE, BUT

00:42:10.261 --> 00:42:11.528
IT'S THE ANTICIPATED

00:42:11.595 --> 00:42:12.730
UNANTICIPATED INCREASE OF FEES

00:42:12.796 --> 00:42:14.732
WITHOUT A FEE CAP. WE APPRECIATE

00:42:14.798 --> 00:42:15.933
THE VITAL ROLE THAT THE

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:16.901
DEPARTMENT PLAYS, AND WE

00:42:16.967 --> 00:42:18.569
UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES THE

00:42:18.636 --> 00:42:20.504
STATE IS FACING. HOWEVER, THE

00:42:20.571 --> 00:42:21.872
IMPOSITION OF THE INCREASED FEE

00:42:21.939 --> 00:42:23.774
TO MAKE UP FOR THE BUDGET

00:42:23.841 --> 00:42:24.842
SHORTFALLS HAS PLACED AN

00:42:24.909 --> 00:42:26.010
UNREASONABLE BURDEN ON

00:42:26.076 --> 00:42:27.544
CALIFORNIA BUILDERS WORKING TO

00:42:27.611 --> 00:42:29.246
ADDRESS OUR HOUSING SHORTAGE. WE

00:42:29.313 --> 00:42:31.849
BELIEVE THAT SB 328 CAN PROVIDE

00:42:31.916 --> 00:42:33.484
A WIN WIN FOR THE STATE BY

00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:34.952
ENSURING CONTAMINATED SOIL IS

00:42:35.019 --> 00:42:37.054
CLEANED UP, WHILE ALSO ALLOWING

00:42:37.121 --> 00:42:39.990
FOR IMPORTANT PROJECTS TO MOVE

00:42:40.057 --> 00:42:41.025
FORWARD. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST

BALANCE, IN RESPECTFUL

00:43:36.313 --> 00:43:37.548
OPPOSITION. WE CERTAINLY

00:43:37.614 --> 00:43:39.016
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE AUTHOR AND

00:43:39.083 --> 00:43:40.384
PROPONENTS ARE SEEKING TO DO

00:43:40.451 --> 00:43:43.053
HERE, AND DON'T DISCOUNT THE

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:45.222
VERY SIGNIFICANT FEES CHARGED BY

00:43:45.289 --> 00:43:46.690
DTSC AS PART OF THE GENERATION

00:43:46.757 --> 00:43:47.891
HANDLING FEE. OUR MEMBERS AS

00:43:47.958 --> 00:43:49.827
WELL ACROSS MANY DIFFERENT

00:43:49.893 --> 00:43:51.962
SECTORS, ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO

00:43:52.029 --> 00:43:53.764
THESE FEES AS GENERATORS OF

00:43:53.831 --> 00:43:55.199
HAZARDOUS WASTE. OUR CONCERN IS

00:43:55.265 --> 00:43:57.668
NOT WITH THE FOCUS ON THESE

00:43:57.735 --> 00:43:59.436
PROJECTS, BUT RATHER JUST THE

00:43:59.503 --> 00:44:01.438
OUTCOME OF THAT. SHOULD THERE BE

00:44:01.505 --> 00:44:04.341
A CAP? THE REMAINING FUNDING

00:44:04.408 --> 00:44:06.043
THAT WOULD NOT BE PAID WOULD

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:09.013
ULTIMATELY BE SPREAD ACROSS C

00:44:09.079 --> 00:44:11.382
MEMBERS AND KIND OF THEIR, YOU

00:44:11.448 --> 00:44:13.217
KNOW, ULTIMATELY WHAT THEY ARE

00:44:13.283 --> 00:44:15.019
HAVING TO PAY AS PART OF THESE

00:44:15.085 --> 00:44:16.420
GENERATION HANDLING FEES,

00:44:16.487 --> 00:44:17.821
ULTIMATELY RESULTING IN OUR

00:44:17.888 --> 00:44:20.424
MEMBERS SUBSIDIZING THE GAP

00:44:20.491 --> 00:44:22.926
BETWEEN WHAT IS NOT PAID AND

00:44:22.993 --> 00:44:23.961
WHAT DTSC NEEDS FOR THEIR

00:44:24.028 --> 00:44:25.796
OPERATIONS. AND SO, AGAIN, JUST

00:44:25.863 --> 00:44:27.898
REALLY WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR. WE

00:44:27.965 --> 00:44:29.033
CERTAINLY RESPECT AND UNDERSTAND

00:44:29.099 --> 00:44:30.834
THE GOALS OF THE BILL AND THE

00:44:30.901 --> 00:44:32.669
REALLY SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES

00:44:32.736 --> 00:44:34.571
ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FEES ON

00:44:34.638 --> 00:44:36.673
THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS. BUT DO

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:38.375
URGE THE COMMITTEE AND CERTAINLY

00:44:38.442 --> 00:44:40.544
THE PROPONENTS, AND WE'VE HAD

00:44:40.611 --> 00:44:41.345
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS AS

00:44:41.412 --> 00:44:43.514
WELL, TO PERHAPS RECONVENE THIS

00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:45.983
FALL AS PART OF A WORK WITH DTSC

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:48.085
ONGOING, AS WELL AS THE BOARD OF

00:44:48.152 --> 00:44:49.219
ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY, TO LOOK AT

00:44:49.286 --> 00:44:51.455
FEE SETTING, WHAT CHANGES MAY BE

00:44:51.522 --> 00:44:52.489
WARRANTED. NOW THAT WE'RE A FEW

00:44:52.556 --> 00:44:54.224
YEARS INTO THIS NEW FEE

00:44:54.291 --> 00:44:55.325
STRUCTURE, BECAUSE CERTAINLY, I

00:44:55.392 --> 00:44:56.560
KNOW OUR MEMBERS ARE VERY

00:44:56.627 --> 00:44:57.928
CONCERNED ABOUT THE

00:44:57.995 --> 00:44:59.997
SUSTAINABILITY OF THIS APPROACH,

00:45:00.064 --> 00:45:01.498
ESPECIALLY WITH A NUMBER OF

00:45:01.565 --> 00:45:02.900
DIFFERENT SECTORS LOOKING FOR

00:45:02.966 --> 00:45:05.002
SIMILAR CARVE OUTS, CAPS FROM

00:45:05.069 --> 00:45:06.770
THESE FEES. SO WITH THAT

00:45:06.837 --> 00:45:08.272
RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION, I

00:45:08.338 --> 00:45:10.007
APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. THANK YOU.

00:45:10.074 --> 00:45:12.509
THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL

00:45:12.576 --> 00:45:15.012
OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE, WE'LL

00:45:15.079 --> 00:45:18.749
BRING IT BACK TO MEMBERS FOR

00:45:18.816 --> 00:45:21.885
QUESTIONS. DISCUSSION. NOT

00:45:21.952 --> 00:45:26.356
SEEING ANY. YEAH. QUICK IF YOU

00:45:26.423 --> 00:45:28.559
CAN COMMENT ON THAT SENATOR A

00:45:28.625 --> 00:45:31.795
LITTLE BIT. AND ALSO YEAH JUST I

00:45:31.862 --> 00:45:34.331
TOTALLY ALSO GET KIND OF THE

00:45:34.398 --> 00:45:35.332
PERSPECTIVE YOU'RE COMING AT

00:45:35.399 --> 00:45:38.368
THIS WITH AND THE IMPORTANCE AT

00:45:38.435 --> 00:45:40.938
THE SAME TIME, IT SEEMS AS IF AS

00:45:41.004 --> 00:45:43.540
WE LOWER FEES ON HOUSING

00:45:43.607 --> 00:45:45.309
DEVELOPERS, ARE WE INCREASING

00:45:45.375 --> 00:45:49.379
FEES ON OTHER ENTITIES, SCHOOLS,

00:45:49.446 --> 00:45:52.149
HOSPITALS, LARGE AND SMALL

00:45:52.216 --> 00:45:54.051
BUSINESSES, ETC? SO KIND OF A

00:45:54.118 --> 00:45:56.954
FOLLOW UP TO THE OPPOSITION AS

00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:58.589
WELL. THANK YOU SO MUCH, MR.

00:45:58.655 --> 00:46:00.924
CHAIR. AND I WANT TO THANK

00:46:00.991 --> 00:46:02.192
OPPOSITION AS WELL. I THINK

00:46:02.259 --> 00:46:03.594
THAT'S ONE OF THE KINDEST

00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:07.231
OPPOSITIONS I'VE EVER HAD IN MY.

00:46:07.297 --> 00:46:12.035
IT WAS AND IT VERY RELEVANT. AND

00:46:12.102 --> 00:46:14.138
THE OBSERVATION OF OPPOSITION IN

00:46:14.204 --> 00:46:16.573
THE FACT THAT IT VERY WELL MAY

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:19.143
BE THAT THAT WOULD BE A

00:46:19.209 --> 00:46:22.279
CONSEQUENCE OF THIS BILL IS

00:46:22.346 --> 00:46:23.881
SOMETHING THAT IS REAL AND I

00:46:23.947 --> 00:46:27.417
THINK IS SOMETHING THAT ALSO IS

00:46:27.484 --> 00:46:30.721
THE IMPETUS FOR WHY WE NEED TO

00:46:30.787 --> 00:46:34.057
HAVE A IN-DEPTH CONVERSATION ON

00:46:34.124 --> 00:46:37.494
FEE REFORM FOR DTSC THAT GOES

00:46:37.561 --> 00:46:39.863
ACROSS THE BOARD. AND THE

00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:41.398
REASON, THE REASON FOR THAT IS,

00:46:41.465 --> 00:46:43.734
FIRST OF ALL, WE HAVE A HOUSING

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:45.836
ISSUE, WE HAVE INFILL ISSUES AND

00:46:45.903 --> 00:46:48.338
WE HAVE CONTAMINATED SOIL. IF

00:46:48.405 --> 00:46:50.307
THE FEES ARE NOT IN A PLACE THAT

00:46:50.374 --> 00:46:52.476
CAN BE AFFORDABLE AND IT BECOMES

00:46:52.543 --> 00:46:54.444
A DISINCENTIVE TO DEVELOP THAT

00:46:54.511 --> 00:46:58.081
LAND, NOW YOU HAVE CONTAMINATED

00:46:58.148 --> 00:47:00.150
SOIL IN PERPETUITY IN THE MIDDLE

00:47:00.217 --> 00:47:02.119
OF AN URBAN SETTING WHERE THAT

00:47:02.186 --> 00:47:03.620
INFILL IS NEVER GOING TO BE

00:47:03.687 --> 00:47:06.023
DEVELOPED. BUT IF WE MAKE THIS

00:47:06.089 --> 00:47:08.859
MOVE, IT'S AN ACTUAL DOUBLE WIN.

00:47:08.926 --> 00:47:10.694
YOU GET CONTAMINATED SOIL

00:47:10.761 --> 00:47:12.663
CLEANED UP AND THEN YOU GET

00:47:12.729 --> 00:47:15.032
HOUSING ON TOP OF THAT. NOW, WE

00:47:15.098 --> 00:47:16.900
SHOULD DO THIS AND MOVE FORWARD

00:47:16.967 --> 00:47:18.902
WITH THIS, BUT NOT TURN A BLIND

00:47:18.969 --> 00:47:20.237
EYE TO WHAT THE CONSEQUENCE

00:47:20.304 --> 00:47:21.772
MIGHT BE. AND I AM FULLY

00:47:21.838 --> 00:47:22.906
COMMITTED. HOPEFULLY YOU DON'T

00:47:22.973 --> 00:47:23.740
THINK THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG

00:47:23.807 --> 00:47:26.176
WITH ME UP HERE, BUT EXCITED TO

00:47:26.243 --> 00:47:28.378
BE ABLE TO COME BACK IN THE

00:47:28.445 --> 00:47:30.147
INTERIM AND HAVE CONVERSATIONS

00:47:30.214 --> 00:47:33.417
ABOUT A FEE STRUCTURE THAT HELPS

00:47:33.483 --> 00:47:35.986
FUND THE GOOD WORK THAT DTSC

00:47:36.053 --> 00:47:37.454
DOES, WE ACTUALLY NEED THEM TO

00:47:37.521 --> 00:47:39.189
DO WHAT THEY'RE DOING, BUT AT

00:47:39.256 --> 00:47:40.958
THE SAME TIME DOESN'T BECOME A

00:47:41.024 --> 00:47:44.861
DISINCENTIVE FOR SCHOOLS OR FOR

00:47:44.928 --> 00:47:47.197
OTHER FOR ANYBODY THAT WOULD

00:47:47.264 --> 00:47:49.066
WANT TO DO ANY KIND OF WORK ON

00:47:49.132 --> 00:47:50.500
CONTAMINATED SOIL. SO WE THINK

00:47:50.567 --> 00:47:52.869
WE NEED TO STRIVE AND WORK VERY

00:47:52.936 --> 00:47:55.272
HARD TO FIND THAT LANDING SPOT

00:47:55.339 --> 00:47:56.607
FOR EVERYBODY. THIS IS THE

00:47:56.673 --> 00:47:58.475
BEGINNING OF THAT, AND THIS CAN

00:47:58.542 --> 00:47:59.843
PROVE TO BE WHAT HELPS US HAVE

00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:01.445
BETTER DISCUSSIONS AND

00:48:01.511 --> 00:48:02.980
CONVERSATIONS WITH THAT, I

00:48:03.046 --> 00:48:04.114
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR, AND I

00:48:04.181 --> 00:48:05.449
APPRECIATE THAT AND APPRECIATE,

00:48:05.515 --> 00:48:06.984
YOU KNOW, YOUR WILLINGNESS TO

00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:08.485
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH

00:48:08.552 --> 00:48:09.786
STAKEHOLDERS. I WILL NOTE THE

00:48:09.853 --> 00:48:11.488
PRESENCE OF A QUORUM. WHY DON'T

00:48:11.555 --> 00:48:14.625
WE STRIKE WHILE THE IRON'S HOT,

00:48:14.691 --> 00:48:16.693
ESTABLISH THAT, AND THEN WE'LL

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:22.466
GET A VOTE ON YOUR MEASURE. ALL

00:48:22.532 --> 00:48:23.166
RIGHT. FOR THE PURPOSES OF

00:48:23.233 --> 00:48:26.103
ESTABLISHING A QUORUM, CONNOLLY

00:48:26.169 --> 00:48:29.206
HERE. CONNOLLY HERE. ELLIS.

00:48:29.273 --> 00:48:31.575
ELLIS HERE. BAUER. KHN.

00:48:31.642 --> 00:48:34.077
BAUER-KAHAN HERE. CASTILLO HERE.

00:48:34.144 --> 00:48:36.680
CASTILLO. HERE. LEE. MCKENNA.

00:48:36.747 --> 00:48:39.750
HOFFMAN. GREAT. YEAH. SO

00:48:39.816 --> 00:48:41.752
REMEMBER, THIS IS FILE ITEM ONE.

00:48:41.818 --> 00:48:44.221
SO GO AHEAD. YES. THANK YOU FOR

00:48:44.288 --> 00:48:45.289
INDULGING ME, MR. CHAIR. AND

00:48:45.355 --> 00:48:48.158
THANK YOU, SENATOR. SO I THINK I

00:48:48.225 --> 00:48:50.260
MEAN, I THINK WHAT YOU'RE TRYING

00:48:50.327 --> 00:48:51.995
TO DO HERE, WHICH, BY THE WAY, I

00:48:52.062 --> 00:48:54.231
KNOW HAS BEEN A LONG EFFORT ON

00:48:54.298 --> 00:48:55.265
YOUR PART TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT

00:48:55.332 --> 00:48:57.534
HOW TO REDUCE THE FEES TO MAKE

00:48:57.601 --> 00:48:58.168
HOUSING MORE AFFORDABLE, WHICH I

00:48:58.235 --> 00:48:59.703
THINK IS A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:01.405
PIECE OF THE PUZZLE AND ONE

00:49:01.471 --> 00:49:02.806
YOU'VE SPENT AN IMMENSE AMOUNT

00:49:02.873 --> 00:49:04.408
OF TIME RESEARCHING AND REALLY

00:49:04.474 --> 00:49:05.742
THINKING ABOUT. AND SO I WANT TO

00:49:05.809 --> 00:49:08.912
GIVE KUDOS TO THAT. I GUESS MY

00:49:08.979 --> 00:49:09.579
ONE CONCERN HERE IS THAT THE WAY

00:49:09.646 --> 00:49:12.516
THIS IS STRUCTURED, I THINK THE

00:49:12.582 --> 00:49:14.318
PEOPLE PAYING FOR IT ARE NOT THE

00:49:14.384 --> 00:49:16.486
RIGHT ENTITIES. RIGHT? SO

00:49:16.553 --> 00:49:18.021
NOTHING IN THIS BILL ENSURES

00:49:18.088 --> 00:49:19.489
THAT WE AS A GOVERNMENT ARE

00:49:19.556 --> 00:49:21.425
PAYING FOR IT, FOR EXAMPLE.

00:49:21.491 --> 00:49:22.693
INSTEAD, IT JUST SHIFTS THAT

00:49:22.759 --> 00:49:24.728
BURDEN TO OTHER PEOPLE IN THE

00:49:24.795 --> 00:49:25.896
SYSTEM. AND THAT FEELS

00:49:25.962 --> 00:49:26.730
ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF A

00:49:26.797 --> 00:49:29.132
SCHOOL OR A HOSPITAL OR ANYBODY

00:49:29.199 --> 00:49:30.400
ELSE, LIKE THE WRONG MECHANISM.

00:49:30.467 --> 00:49:32.369
AND SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE

00:49:32.436 --> 00:49:34.271
BILL BECAUSE I THINK WE ALIGN IN

00:49:34.338 --> 00:49:35.439
OUR GOALS. BUT I'M REALLY

00:49:35.505 --> 00:49:37.341
HOPEFUL THAT, AS YOU SAID, IN

00:49:37.407 --> 00:49:38.275
YOUR CLOTHES, WE CAN WORK HARDER

00:49:38.342 --> 00:49:40.410
ON HOW WE FUND THIS, BECAUSE I

00:49:40.477 --> 00:49:41.278
THINK SHIFTING THE COST IS NOT

00:49:41.345 --> 00:49:43.780
THE ANSWER. RIGHT. YEAH. WOULD

00:49:43.847 --> 00:49:45.615
YOU LIKE TO CLOSE NOT TO TALK

00:49:45.682 --> 00:49:47.851
MYSELF OUT OF THAT? I VOTE THAT

00:49:47.918 --> 00:49:49.920
WAS JUST COMMITTED. BUT I DO

00:49:49.986 --> 00:49:51.355
THINK THAT IS WHY WE NEED TO

00:49:51.421 --> 00:49:53.090
HAVE FURTHER CONVERSATION,

00:49:53.156 --> 00:49:55.025
BECAUSE I'M NOT QUITE SURE WE

00:49:55.092 --> 00:49:57.994
ARE SUPPOSING THAT BECAUSE WE'RE

00:49:58.061 --> 00:49:59.863
RELIEVING HERE THAT IT'S GOING

00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:01.264
TO INCREASE OVER HERE. I THINK

00:50:01.331 --> 00:50:02.766
THERE NEEDS TO BE AN IN-DEPTH

00:50:02.833 --> 00:50:04.634
STUDY ON FEES AND IN-DEPTH STUDY

00:50:04.701 --> 00:50:07.537
ON ACTUAL COST OF THE AGENCY

00:50:07.604 --> 00:50:10.640
ITSELF. AND HOW THEIR STRUCTURE

00:50:10.707 --> 00:50:13.610
WORKS INTERNALLY, AND FIGURE OUT

00:50:13.677 --> 00:50:16.213
EXACTLY WHAT ARE THOSE COST AS

00:50:16.279 --> 00:50:18.348
FEES AND NOT TAXES. IN OTHER

00:50:18.415 --> 00:50:20.751
WORDS, IT'S A COST RECOVERY

00:50:20.817 --> 00:50:22.552
MECHANISM AND IT NEEDS TO REMAIN

00:50:22.619 --> 00:50:26.523
THAT WAY. SO I THINK A BETTER,

00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:29.459
DEEPER STUDY WOULD BE GOOD FOR

00:50:29.526 --> 00:50:31.595
US IN THE INTERIM ALONG WITH

00:50:31.661 --> 00:50:32.429
CONVERSATIONS. BUT I DO THINK

00:50:32.496 --> 00:50:34.765
IT'S PRUDENT THAT WE ACT NOW ON

00:50:34.831 --> 00:50:37.667
HOUSING AND CONTAMINATED SOIL IN

00:50:37.734 --> 00:50:40.637
URBAN SETTINGS. OKAY, THIS HAS

00:50:40.704 --> 00:50:43.907
AN I RECO FROM THE CHAIR. MADAM

00:50:43.974 --> 00:50:46.309

00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:59.656
SIMILAR QUESTIONS EARLIER. YEAH.

00:50:59.723 --> 00:51:01.925
ALL RIGHT. THIS IS ITEM ONE SB

THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND GOOD

00:53:31.341 --> 00:53:32.776
AFTERNOON, COLLEAGUES. I'M

00:53:32.842 --> 00:53:35.211
PRESENTING THIS BILL, SB 754,

00:53:35.278 --> 00:53:37.747
WHICH IMPROVES TRANSPARENCY AND

00:53:37.814 --> 00:53:39.583
PRODUCTS, PROTECTS PUBLIC HEALTH

00:53:39.649 --> 00:53:41.618
BY REQUIRING MANUFACTURERS OF

00:53:41.685 --> 00:53:44.187
DISPOSABLE MENSTRUAL PRODUCTS TO

00:53:44.254 --> 00:53:45.989
DISCLOSE THE CONCENTRATIONS OF

00:53:46.056 --> 00:53:48.024
POTENTIALLY HARMFUL CONTAMINANTS

00:53:48.091 --> 00:53:50.260
IN THEIR PRODUCTS. MILLIONS OF

00:53:50.327 --> 00:53:51.728
CALIFORNIANS USE PADS AND

00:53:51.795 --> 00:53:53.263
TAMPONS EVERY MONTH, OFTEN

00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:55.332
STARTING AS EARLY AS TEN YEARS

00:53:55.398 --> 00:53:57.901
OLD AND CONTINUING FOR DECADES.

00:53:57.968 --> 00:53:59.669
CURRENT LAW REQUIRES DISCLOSURE

00:53:59.736 --> 00:54:02.305
OF INTENTIONALLY ADDED

00:54:02.372 --> 00:54:04.407
INGREDIENTS. A VERY GOOD,

00:54:04.474 --> 00:54:05.909
EXCELLENT STEP IN ENSURING THE

00:54:05.976 --> 00:54:07.243
SAFETY OF THIS PRODUCTS, BUT IT

00:54:07.310 --> 00:54:09.312
DOES NOT COVER HARMFUL

00:54:09.379 --> 00:54:10.947
UNINTENTIONAL CONTAMINANTS THAT

00:54:11.014 --> 00:54:13.383
MAY APPEAR AS BYPRODUCTS OF THE

00:54:13.450 --> 00:54:15.118
MANUFACTURING PROCESS. RECENT

00:54:15.185 --> 00:54:17.587
SCIENCE MAKES CLEAR THIS GAP IS

00:54:17.654 --> 00:54:19.089
DANGEROUS. A PEER REVIEWED STUDY

00:54:19.155 --> 00:54:21.958
PUBLISHED LAST YEAR FOUND TOXIC

00:54:22.025 --> 00:54:24.861
METALS IN EVERY TAMPON TESTED,

00:54:24.928 --> 00:54:26.663
INCLUDING LEAD, WHICH HAS NO

00:54:26.730 --> 00:54:28.865
SAFE LEVEL OF EXPOSURE. ON

00:54:28.932 --> 00:54:31.267
AVERAGE, TAMPONS CONTAINED LEAD

00:54:31.334 --> 00:54:32.402
LEVELS EIGHT TIMES HIGHER THAN

00:54:32.469 --> 00:54:34.237
THE FEDERAL LIMIT FOR LEAD IN

00:54:34.304 --> 00:54:36.673
DRINKING WATER. THESE RISKS ARE

00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:38.842
MAGNIFIED BECAUSE VAGINAL TISSUE

00:54:38.908 --> 00:54:41.077
IS HIGHLY PERMEABLE. CHEMICALS

00:54:41.144 --> 00:54:42.479
ABSORBED THIS WAY ENTER THE

00:54:42.545 --> 00:54:44.014
BLOODSTREAM MORE DIRECTLY THAN

00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:45.715
THROUGH EXPOSURE THROUGH THE

00:54:45.782 --> 00:54:46.916
MOUTH, CREATING A HIGHER

00:54:46.983 --> 00:54:48.952
POTENTIAL FOR HARM. THIS BILL

00:54:49.019 --> 00:54:51.154
CREATES TRANSPARENCY IN THESE

00:54:51.221 --> 00:54:52.622
PRODUCTS BY REQUIRING

00:54:52.689 --> 00:54:54.791
MANUFACTURERS TO TEST FOR FOUR

00:54:54.858 --> 00:54:57.694
METALS IN DISPOSABLE MENSTRUAL

00:54:57.761 --> 00:55:00.397
PRODUCTS LEAD, ARSENIC, CADMIUM,

00:55:00.463 --> 00:55:02.599
AND ZINC. THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:55:02.666 --> 00:55:05.201
TOXIC SUBSTANCE CONTROL IS THEN

00:55:05.268 --> 00:55:07.337
ABLE TO CONDUCT INDEPENDENT

00:55:07.404 --> 00:55:09.506
TESTING TO VERIFY THOSE RESULTS

00:55:09.572 --> 00:55:11.675
AND PUBLISH THE RESULTS OF ANY

00:55:11.741 --> 00:55:13.376
TESTING, ALONG WITH THEIR OWN

00:55:13.443 --> 00:55:14.544
ANALYSIS. WE'VE DONE A LOT OF

00:55:14.611 --> 00:55:16.646
GOOD WORK ON INCREASING

00:55:16.713 --> 00:55:18.114
ACCESSIBILITY TO MENSTRUAL

00:55:18.181 --> 00:55:19.916
PRODUCTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN

00:55:19.983 --> 00:55:21.418
AVAILABLE IN ALL CALIFORNIA

00:55:21.484 --> 00:55:23.553
PUBLIC SCHOOLS FOR THE LAST

00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:25.288
THREE YEARS. NOW, LET'S TAKE THE

00:55:25.355 --> 00:55:27.290
NEXT STEP TOWARDS ENSURING THAT

00:55:27.357 --> 00:55:29.659
THESE PRODUCTS ARE SAFE. ARE

00:55:29.726 --> 00:55:31.061
SAFE. WE WORKED ON AMENDMENTS

00:55:31.127 --> 00:55:32.495
THAT MAKE CLEAR WHICH TESTING

00:55:32.562 --> 00:55:34.764
METHODS WILL BE ACCEPTABLE FOR

00:55:34.831 --> 00:55:35.932
DETERMINING THESE CONCENTRATIONS

00:55:35.999 --> 00:55:38.702
OF CHEMICALS, AND ARE COMMITTED

00:55:38.768 --> 00:55:40.570
TO CONTINUE TO SHARPEN THE BILL.

00:55:40.637 --> 00:55:41.771
TODAY, I HAVE WITH ME JUSTINE

AND WELL-BEING OF ALL STUDENTS.

00:56:36.893 --> 00:56:39.129
AND ALTHOUGH AB 367 WAS A STEP

00:56:39.195 --> 00:56:40.463
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, FURTHER

00:56:40.530 --> 00:56:42.232
ACTION MUST BE TAKEN TO ENSURE

00:56:42.298 --> 00:56:43.666

ORGAN SYSTEMS, SUCH AS LEAD, IS

00:58:37.247 --> 00:58:39.415
CONCERNING FOR SEVERAL REASONS

00:58:39.482 --> 00:58:40.884
ONE. PEOPLE WHO MENSTRUATE USE

00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:42.318
MENSTRUAL PRODUCTS ON A

00:58:42.385 --> 00:58:44.220
CONSISTENT LONG TERM BASIS. OVER

00:58:44.287 --> 00:58:46.689
THE COURSE OF ABOUT 40 YEARS OF

00:58:46.756 --> 00:58:47.924
MENSTRUATION, PEOPLE WHO

00:58:47.991 --> 00:58:48.758
MENSTRUATE WILL USE ABOUT 15

00:58:48.825 --> 00:58:50.894
PRODUCTS EVERY MONTH. THIS ADDS

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:52.729
UP TO MORE THAN 10,000 MENSTRUAL

00:58:52.795 --> 00:58:54.931
PRODUCTS OVER A LIFETIME. TWO

00:58:54.998 --> 00:58:56.466
GIVEN THIS CONSISTENT LONG TERM

00:58:56.532 --> 00:58:58.167
USE OF MENSTRUAL PRODUCTS, THE

00:58:58.234 --> 00:58:59.903
EXPOSURE TO HARMFUL CHEMICALS

00:58:59.969 --> 00:59:01.004
THROUGH MENSTRUAL PRODUCTS IS

00:59:01.070 --> 00:59:03.573
VERY HIGH. THREE CHEMICALS

00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:05.308
ABSORBED BY THE VAGINA DIRECTLY

00:59:05.375 --> 00:59:07.243
ENTER SYSTEMIC CIRCULATION,

00:59:07.310 --> 00:59:09.345
MEANING THESE CHEMICALS ARE NOT

00:59:09.412 --> 00:59:10.780
DETOXIFIED BY THE LIVER BEFORE

00:59:10.847 --> 00:59:12.081
BEING CIRCULATED THROUGH THE

00:59:12.148 --> 00:59:14.951
BODY. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN

00:59:15.018 --> 00:59:16.486
PROPRANOLOL, A MEDICATION FOR

00:59:16.552 --> 00:59:18.655
HEART PROBLEMS, IS ADMINISTERED

00:59:18.721 --> 00:59:19.989
VAGINALLY, THE MAXIMUM

00:59:20.056 --> 00:59:21.624
CONCENTRATION REACHING THE

00:59:21.691 --> 00:59:23.760
BLOODSTREAM IS TWICE AS HIGH

00:59:23.826 --> 00:59:25.628
COMPARED TO WHEN THE SAME AMOUNT

00:59:25.695 --> 00:59:26.930
IS ADMINISTERED ORALLY.

00:59:26.996 --> 00:59:27.964
REGARDLESS OF WHERE THESE

00:59:28.031 --> 00:59:29.198
CHEMICALS COME FROM, WHETHER

00:59:29.265 --> 00:59:30.600
THEY'RE INTENTIONAL OR

00:59:30.667 --> 00:59:31.968
UNINTENTIONAL CONTAMINANTS, IT'S

00:59:32.035 --> 00:59:33.770
IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE

00:59:33.836 --> 00:59:35.138
BREADTH OF CONCENTRATIONS

00:59:35.204 --> 00:59:36.940
PRESENT IN THE PRODUCTS PEOPLE

TRANSPARENCY. MANUFACTURERS ALSO

01:00:59.522 --> 01:01:01.257
ALSO SHARE THAT COMMITMENT AND

01:01:01.324 --> 01:01:02.692

DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT

01:01:30.153 --> 01:01:32.188
RESPONSIBLY. IT AUTHORIZES THE

01:03:26.335 --> 01:03:27.436

SAFETY OF CONSUMERS AS AN UTMOST

01:03:43.252 --> 01:03:44.820
PRIORITY. THE COMMITMENT TO

01:03:44.887 --> 01:03:46.322
SAFETY GOES DOWN TO THE LEVEL OF

01:03:46.389 --> 01:03:47.490
CHEMICALS THAT ARE PRESENT IN

01:03:47.557 --> 01:03:48.991

WITH THE LETTER OF THE LAW,

01:03:52.061 --> 01:03:53.462
WE'RE HIGHLIGHTING CONCERNING

ASPECTS THAT REMAIN IN SENATE

01:03:54.764 --> 01:03:56.766

01:04:12.915 --> 01:04:14.317
MISINTERPRETED AND LEAD TO

01:04:14.383 --> 01:04:16.018
UNNECESSARY PUBLIC CONCERN. THE

01:04:16.085 --> 01:04:17.386
FDA CURRENTLY REGULATES AND

01:04:17.453 --> 01:04:18.521

THE MARKET AS MEDICAL DEVICES

01:04:20.323 --> 01:04:22.391
FOR SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS. IN

01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:24.260
JANUARY OF THIS YEAR, THE FDA

01:04:24.327 --> 01:04:25.828

WITH TAMPON USE AND CONTAMINANT

01:04:31.234 --> 01:04:33.502
EXPOSURE. THE FDA CONTINUES TO

01:04:33.569 --> 01:04:34.804
RECOMMEND FDA CLEARED TAMPONS AS

01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:37.306
A SAFE OPTION FOR USE AS A

01:04:37.373 --> 01:04:38.774
MENSTRUAL PRODUCT. ADDITIONALLY,

01:04:38.841 --> 01:04:39.842

ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS HAVE BEEN

01:04:54.323 --> 01:04:55.658
TAKEN BY THE FOOD AND DRUG

01:04:55.725 --> 01:04:57.660

MENSTRUAL PRODUCTS RIGHT TO KNOW

01:05:00.529 --> 01:05:01.764
ACT, REQUIRING MANUFACTURERS TO

01:05:01.831 --> 01:05:03.165
LIST ALL INTENTIONALLY ADDED

01:05:03.232 --> 01:05:04.333
INGREDIENTS CONTAINED IN

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:05.768
MENSTRUAL PRODUCTS. AND JUST

01:05:05.835 --> 01:05:07.103
LAST SESSION IN 2024, THE

01:05:07.169 --> 01:05:09.305
GOVERNOR SIGNED ASSEMBLY BILL

01:05:09.372 --> 01:05:11.374
2515, WHICH BANS PFAS SUBSTANCES

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:12.575
FOR MENSTRUAL PRODUCTS WITH

01:05:12.642 --> 01:05:14.110
OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT

01:05:14.176 --> 01:05:16.212
MECHANISMS THROUGH DTSC, WHICH

01:05:16.279 --> 01:05:17.580
BHP MEMBERS ARE CURRENTLY

01:05:17.647 --> 01:05:19.081
WORKING TO COMPLY WITH. THIS

01:05:19.148 --> 01:05:20.783
BILL WOULD ADD ANOTHER LAYER OF

01:05:20.850 --> 01:05:22.218
COMPLIANCE TO MANUFACTURERS.

01:05:22.285 --> 01:05:23.753
HAVING TO COVER THE COST OF

01:05:23.819 --> 01:05:25.154
ADDITIONAL TESTING AS MANDATED

01:05:25.221 --> 01:05:27.957
UNDER SB 754, IMPOSING

01:05:28.024 --> 01:05:29.425
UNPREDICTABLE FINANCIAL BURDENS,

01:05:29.492 --> 01:05:31.260
ESPECIALLY FOR SMALLER

01:05:31.327 --> 01:05:32.295
MANUFACTURERS. AS PREVIOUSLY

01:05:32.361 --> 01:05:33.396
MENTIONED, THE SAFER CONSUMER

01:05:33.462 --> 01:05:35.164
PRODUCTS PROGRAM IS RESEARCHING

01:05:35.231 --> 01:05:36.632
CHEMICALS OF CONCERN IN

01:05:36.699 --> 01:05:37.933
MENSTRUAL PRODUCTS TO PROVIDE A

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.902
PUBLIC DOCUMENT ON THEIR

01:05:39.969 --> 01:05:41.337
FINDINGS, AND WE FEEL THAT THE

01:05:41.404 --> 01:05:43.606
GOALS OF THIS LEGISLATION COULD

01:05:43.673 --> 01:05:44.573
BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THAT

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:46.676
PROGRAM. UNDER DTC'S EXISTING

01:05:46.742 --> 01:05:48.544
BUDGET. LASTLY, WE DO SHARE THE

01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:50.413
CONCERN OF PUBLISHING ANALYTICAL

01:05:50.479 --> 01:05:52.114
RESULTS ON DTZ'S WEBSITE WITHOUT

01:05:52.181 --> 01:05:53.683
ANY REGARD TO LEVELS OF

01:05:53.749 --> 01:05:55.718
EXPOSURE, VARIABILITY AND LAB

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:57.219
PRACTICES, OR CAPACITY OF

01:05:57.286 --> 01:05:58.988
TESTING LABORATORIES. THIS

01:05:59.055 --> 01:06:01.223
PROVISION WAS TAKEN OUT OF AB

01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:02.558
2515 LAST YEAR. DUE TO THE

01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:04.360
COMPLEXITY OF CONVEYING THIS

01:06:04.427 --> 01:06:05.761
INFORMATION WITHOUT CREATING A

01:06:05.828 --> 01:06:07.663
NECESSARY PUBLIC CONCERN,

01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:09.465
PRODUCT SAFETY IS A TOP PRIORITY

01:06:09.532 --> 01:06:10.566
FOR BHP AND OUR MEMBERS, AND WE

01:06:10.633 --> 01:06:12.368
SUPPORT PREVENTING EXPOSURE TO

01:06:12.435 --> 01:06:14.470
DANGEROUS CHEMICALS. WHILE WE

01:06:14.537 --> 01:06:15.838
UNDERSTAND THE GOALS OF THIS

01:06:15.905 --> 01:06:16.939
LEGISLATION, THE REMAINING

01:06:17.006 --> 01:06:18.474
ISSUES I JUST OUTLINED MUST BE

01:06:18.541 --> 01:06:20.309
ADDRESSED FOR COMPANIES TO BE

01:06:20.376 --> 01:06:21.510
ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY COMPLY WITH

01:06:21.577 --> 01:06:23.112
THIS LAW. FOR THOSE REASONS, WE

01:06:23.179 --> 01:06:24.613
REMAIN OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED,

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:26.282
AND WILL CONTINUE ENGAGING WITH

01:06:26.349 --> 01:06:27.683
THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE. THANK YOU

01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:32.054
FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. SEEING

01:06:32.121 --> 01:06:34.223
NO ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION, WE'LL

01:06:34.290 --> 01:06:37.660
BRING IT BACK TO MEMBERS FOR

01:06:37.727 --> 01:06:38.928
QUESTIONS. DISCUSSION. VICE

01:06:38.994 --> 01:06:42.565
CHAIR. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR.

01:06:42.631 --> 01:06:45.768
SENATOR. THANK YOU. I CERTAINLY

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:47.670
RESPECT WHERE YOU'RE GOING HERE.

01:06:47.737 --> 01:06:49.905
I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR

01:06:49.972 --> 01:06:54.076
ANY OF YOU. YOU MENTIONED FOUR

01:06:54.143 --> 01:06:57.313
METALS OF CONCERNS, I THINK.

01:06:57.380 --> 01:07:00.583
ZINC. I CAN'T SEE WHAT WHATEVER

01:07:00.649 --> 01:07:05.921
THE FOUR WERE. WHY DID YOU NOT

01:07:05.988 --> 01:07:07.790
MENTION THE OTHER METALS OF

01:07:07.857 --> 01:07:18.134
CONCERN?

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:20.403
THE. I'M SORRY, THE MAIN REASON

01:07:20.469 --> 01:07:23.205
IS BECAUSE THESE HAD THE HIGHEST

01:07:23.272 --> 01:07:26.375
THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATIONS THAT

01:07:26.442 --> 01:07:28.878
WERE FOUND. OKAY. AND THEN DO

01:07:28.944 --> 01:07:30.813
YOU KNOW IF THAT'S IN PARTS PER

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:34.016
BILLION OR PARTS PER MILLION? I

01:07:34.083 --> 01:07:36.118
HAVE PER BILLION, I'M PRETTY

01:07:36.185 --> 01:07:46.362
SURE. AND THEN DO YOU AND THEN

01:07:46.429 --> 01:07:48.297
I'LL ASK, I'LL GO AHEAD AND ADD

01:07:48.364 --> 01:07:50.633
ON WHILE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR

01:07:50.699 --> 01:07:55.337
THAT. DO YOU KNOW IF THESE

01:07:55.404 --> 01:07:57.373
METALS OF CONCERNS, WHAT

01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.408
COMPOUND OR WHAT FORMULATION

01:07:59.475 --> 01:08:01.610
THEY ARE IN? AND I'LL GIVE YOU

01:08:01.677 --> 01:08:08.517
AN EXAMPLE. ZINC FOR EXAMPLE.

01:08:08.584 --> 01:08:10.286
WHEN YOU HAVE A COLD, YOU HAVE

01:08:10.352 --> 01:08:14.190
ZINC GLUCONATE. ZINC I THINK

01:08:14.256 --> 01:08:16.625
ZINC ACETATE. AND THEN IN SOME

01:08:16.692 --> 01:08:18.461
OTHER INDUSTRIAL USES THAT ARE

01:08:18.527 --> 01:08:19.728
NON-SOLUBLE THAT HAVE LIKE A, I

01:08:19.795 --> 01:08:22.865
THINK A 100,000 YEAR LEECH LIFE

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:24.767
IN CHEMICAL, CHEMICAL LEACHING,

01:08:24.834 --> 01:08:27.837
YOU HAVE SOME OXIDES. SO I GUESS

01:08:27.903 --> 01:08:30.906
MY QUESTION IS THESE METALS HAVE

01:08:30.973 --> 01:08:32.741
CONCERNS THAT YOU TALK ABOUT, DO

01:08:32.808 --> 01:08:35.211
YOU KNOW WHAT FORM THEY'RE IN OR

01:08:35.277 --> 01:08:37.746
WHAT COMPOUND THEY'RE IN. I

01:08:37.813 --> 01:08:41.217
DON'T KNOW THE IF I CAN MR. IF I

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:46.355
CAN ANSWER, OKAY. THANK YOU. THE

01:08:46.422 --> 01:08:49.525
RECENT TESTING THAT WE FOUND AT

01:08:49.592 --> 01:08:51.327
COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY WAS THAT

01:08:51.393 --> 01:08:53.262
SOME TAMPON PRODUCTS CONTAINED

01:08:53.329 --> 01:08:55.231
ZINC AT AN AVERAGE CONCENTRATION

01:08:55.297 --> 01:08:59.335
OF 52,000 NANOGRAMS PER GRAM. SO

01:08:59.401 --> 01:09:01.470
THIS IS ROUGHLY TEN TIMES HIGHER

01:09:01.537 --> 01:09:03.105
THAN THE LEVELS SHOWN TO CAUSE

01:09:03.172 --> 01:09:05.074
HARM TO HUMAN CELLS IN

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:06.842
LABORATORY STUDIES. IT'S AN

01:09:06.909 --> 01:09:08.744
ESSENTIAL NUTRIENT, BUT IN HIGH

01:09:08.811 --> 01:09:11.213
AMOUNTS IT BECOMES TOXIC. AND DO

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:12.314
YOU KNOW WHAT COMPOUND THOSE

01:09:12.381 --> 01:09:14.984
ARE? MY QUESTION BECAUSE IS IT

01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:15.818
LEACHABLE OR NON LEACHABLE

01:09:15.885 --> 01:09:20.956
INSOLUBLE OR NON SOLUBLE? I

01:09:21.023 --> 01:09:22.024
DON'T WITHOUT WITHOUT

01:09:22.091 --> 01:09:23.826
BELABORING. I'M SORRY. THAT'S A

01:09:23.893 --> 01:09:24.860
TECHNICAL QUESTION. WITHOUT

01:09:24.927 --> 01:09:26.662
BELABORING THAT POINT I, I WAS

01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:28.264
JUST WANTING TO MAKE THE POINT

01:09:28.330 --> 01:09:32.167
THAT, THAT IN ALL OF THESE

01:09:32.234 --> 01:09:33.168
METALS, THERE ARE SEVERAL

01:09:33.235 --> 01:09:38.307
COMPOUNDS THAT ARE. SOLUBLE AND

01:09:38.374 --> 01:09:40.409
THOSE THAT ARE NOT. AND MY

01:09:40.476 --> 01:09:42.244
CONCERN IS THAT IT CAN BE

01:09:42.311 --> 01:09:44.713
DETECTED, BUT THE DETECTION

01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:46.215
ISN'T SOLUBLE OR NON-SOLUBLE. SO

01:09:46.282 --> 01:09:48.651
I JUST I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT

01:09:48.717 --> 01:09:49.585
POINT. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH

01:09:49.652 --> 01:09:51.587
FOR PUTTING THIS FORWARD. THANK

01:09:51.654 --> 01:09:55.457
YOU, THANK YOU. OTHER QUESTIONS

01:09:55.524 --> 01:09:57.560
I JUST WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR

01:09:57.626 --> 01:10:00.329
FOR THIS BILL. I, AS A CONSUMER

01:10:00.396 --> 01:10:02.431
OF THESE PRODUCTS, IT WASN'T

01:10:02.498 --> 01:10:04.199
UNTIL I WAS ACTUALLY ON THIS

01:10:04.266 --> 01:10:06.235
COMMITTEE THAT I UNDERSTOOD THE

01:10:06.302 --> 01:10:06.902
NUMBER OF THINGS THAT COULD BE

01:10:06.969 --> 01:10:08.270
IN THESE PRODUCTS THAT I COULD

01:10:08.337 --> 01:10:10.272
BE EXPOSED TO ON A MONTHLY BASIS

01:10:10.339 --> 01:10:11.240
FOR DAYS. I MEAN, IF YOU THINK

01:10:11.307 --> 01:10:13.542
ABOUT HOW, YOU KNOW, MOST WOMEN

01:10:13.609 --> 01:10:14.443
ARE USING THESE MENSTRUAL

01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:17.079
PRODUCTS CONTINUOUSLY FOR 5 TO 7

01:10:17.146 --> 01:10:19.348
DAYS EVERY SINGLE MONTH IN THEIR

01:10:19.415 --> 01:10:21.183
BODIES, THAT IS SIGNIFICANT

01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:23.519
EXPOSURE. AND SO I STARTED TO

01:10:23.586 --> 01:10:25.287
TRY TO RESEARCH ON MY OWN, WHICH

01:10:25.354 --> 01:10:26.889
WERE SAFE AND WHICH WERE NOT.

01:10:26.956 --> 01:10:29.091
AND IT IS INCREDIBLY HARD AS A

01:10:29.158 --> 01:10:31.126
CONSUMER, EVEN IF YOU'RE

01:10:31.193 --> 01:10:33.295
KNOWLEDGEABLE, TO FIGURE IT OUT.

01:10:33.362 --> 01:10:35.297
AND SO I JUST WANT TO SAY, I

01:10:35.364 --> 01:10:37.166
HOPE YOU DON'T TAKE OUT THE PART

01:10:37.232 --> 01:10:39.668
WHERE THEY HAVE TO PUBLICLY

01:10:39.735 --> 01:10:40.235
DISCLOSE IT, BECAUSE I THINK

01:10:40.302 --> 01:10:41.403
THAT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT

01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:43.072
CONSUMERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO

01:10:43.138 --> 01:10:44.473
KNOW. AND I THINK WHAT THAT WILL

01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:46.542
DO IS IT WILL PUSH INDUSTRY. WE

01:10:46.609 --> 01:10:48.010
WILL PICK THE SAFE PRODUCTS, AND

01:10:48.077 --> 01:10:50.212
SO SOMEBODY WILL FIGURE OUT HOW

01:10:50.279 --> 01:10:51.447
TO DO IT AND THEY WILL WIN. AND

01:10:51.513 --> 01:10:52.848
THAT'S HOW WHEN A MARKET

01:10:52.915 --> 01:10:55.250
FUNCTIONS BEST. AND SO, YOU

01:10:55.317 --> 01:10:56.385
KNOW, YOU'RE NOT BANNING

01:10:56.452 --> 01:10:57.786
ANYTHING HERE. YOU ARE MERELY

01:10:57.853 --> 01:10:59.021
SAYING THAT CONSUMERS HAVE A

01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:00.623
RIGHT TO KNOW IF THEY'RE PUTTING

01:11:00.689 --> 01:11:02.224
CARCINOGENS INTO THEIR BODY 5 TO

01:11:02.291 --> 01:11:03.926
7 DAYS A MONTH CONTINUOUSLY.

01:11:03.993 --> 01:11:06.095
THAT'S A LOT OF TIME. AND SO I

01:11:06.161 --> 01:11:07.997
THINK THIS IS CRITICALLY

01:11:08.063 --> 01:11:08.597
IMPORTANT. YOU KNOW, THERE WAS

01:11:08.664 --> 01:11:11.734
SOME OPPOSITION COMMENTARY ABOUT

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:12.935
HOW THERE ISN'T ENOUGH

01:11:13.002 --> 01:11:14.770
SPECIFICITY, SPECIFICITY,

01:11:14.837 --> 01:11:15.838
ALTHOUGH I WILL NOTE THAT THE

01:11:15.904 --> 01:11:17.306
LETTERS THAT CAME IN DON'T

01:11:17.373 --> 01:11:18.040
ACTUALLY PROVIDE YOU WITH ANY

01:11:18.107 --> 01:11:19.441
INPUT ABOUT HOW YOU COULD BE

01:11:19.508 --> 01:11:21.276
MORE SPECIFIC IN ANY OF THOSE

01:11:21.343 --> 01:11:22.411
WAYS. OBVIOUSLY, I THINK THE

01:11:22.478 --> 01:11:24.079
AUTHOR, KNOWING HER AND HER MANY

01:11:24.146 --> 01:11:25.581
YEARS OF SERVICE, WE'VE BEEN

01:11:25.648 --> 01:11:26.482
HERE TOGETHER THAT TO THE EXTENT

01:11:26.548 --> 01:11:28.283
THAT SHE CAN BE PROVIDE

01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:29.451
CLARIFICATION, I KNOW THAT SHE

01:11:29.518 --> 01:11:30.619
WOULD ABSOLUTELY BE HAPPY TO.

01:11:30.686 --> 01:11:32.154
BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU'RE

01:11:32.221 --> 01:11:34.523
TRYING TO HIDE THIS INFORMATION

01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:35.290
FROM CONSUMERS, I THINK THAT

01:11:35.357 --> 01:11:36.358
THAT DEFEATS THE GOAL OF THE

01:11:36.425 --> 01:11:37.359
BILL AND ONE THAT'S INCREDIBLY

01:11:37.426 --> 01:11:39.294
IMPORTANT FOR THE WOMEN OF

01:11:39.361 --> 01:11:40.295
CALIFORNIA. WITH THAT, I'M HAPPY

01:11:40.362 --> 01:11:41.497
TO SUPPORT. THANK YOU. GREAT.

01:11:41.563 --> 01:11:43.132
AND I THINK YOU DID MOVE THE

01:11:43.198 --> 01:11:45.968
BILL. THIS IS A SUPPORT

01:11:46.035 --> 01:11:47.269
RECOMMENDATION. APPRECIATE YOUR

01:11:47.336 --> 01:11:50.239
WORK ON THIS. WOULD YOU LIKE TO

01:11:50.305 --> 01:11:51.907
CLOSE? WELL, AND I APPRECIATE

01:11:51.974 --> 01:11:53.409
ALL OF ALL OF YOUR COMMENTS. SO

01:11:53.475 --> 01:11:55.177
JUST TO CLARIFY THIS IS A BILL

01:11:55.244 --> 01:11:56.679
ABOUT TRANSPARENCY. AND THAT'S

01:11:56.745 --> 01:11:58.814
REALLY IMPORTANT. WE'RE NOT

01:11:58.881 --> 01:12:01.383
LOOKING TO BAN OR DO ANYTHING IS

01:12:01.450 --> 01:12:02.518
WE WANT TRANSPARENCY. AND

01:12:02.584 --> 01:12:04.286
THERE'S JUST VERY LITTLE

01:12:04.353 --> 01:12:06.822
RESEARCH DONE ON THIS SO FAR.

01:12:06.889 --> 01:12:08.023
AND THAT'S WHY THE INFORMATION

01:12:08.090 --> 01:12:10.392
IS SO IMPORTANT. AND ESPECIALLY

01:12:10.459 --> 01:12:12.695
AS YOU SAID, TO MAKE IT PUBLIC.

01:12:12.761 --> 01:12:14.396
SO WITH THAT, I RESPECTFULLY ASK

01:12:14.463 --> 01:12:15.497
FOR YOUR VOTE. APPRECIATE IT.

01:12:15.564 --> 01:12:18.500
AND HAPPY TO SECOND THE MOTION.

01:12:18.567 --> 01:12:20.736
WITH THAT, WHY DON'T WE CALL THE

01:12:20.803 --> 01:12:22.971
ROLL? THIS IS FIVE ITEM NUMBER

01:12:23.038 --> 01:12:25.474
FOR SB 754 AUTHORED BY SENATOR

01:12:25.541 --> 01:12:28.143

01:12:29.878 --> 01:12:38.487
RESOURCES. ARE YOU SURE? YES. MY

01:12:38.554 --> 01:12:40.022
APOLOGIES. IT'S DUE. PASS THE

01:12:40.089 --> 01:12:42.091
COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS.

JUDICIARY. LET'S DO IT.

01:13:57.900 --> 01:13:59.902
ALL RIGHT. WE WILL MOVE TO FILE

01:13:59.968 --> 01:14:02.171

01:14:02.237 --> 01:14:04.206
CABALLERO TO COME ON UP, THIS IS

01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:16.084

THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO I HAVE

01:14:20.055 --> 01:14:21.957
THIS SAYS GOOD MORNING BUT

01:14:22.024 --> 01:14:22.825
OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT MORNING. IT'S

01:14:22.891 --> 01:14:25.794
AFTERNOON. STALL A LITTLE BIT.

01:14:25.861 --> 01:14:27.996
GOOD AFTERNOON MR. CHAIR AND

01:14:28.063 --> 01:14:29.364

SB 466 WHICH WILL PROVIDE NARROW

01:14:32.668 --> 01:14:35.571
LEGAL LEGAL PROTECTIONS AGAINST

01:14:35.637 --> 01:14:37.673
AGAINST COSTLY THIRD PARTY

01:14:37.739 --> 01:14:39.107
LAWSUITS FOR WATER PROVIDERS WHO

01:14:39.174 --> 01:14:40.943
ARE IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH AN

01:14:41.009 --> 01:14:43.912
APPROVED OR PENDING CHROMIUM SIX

01:14:43.979 --> 01:14:46.348
MAXIMUM CONTAMINANT LEVEL OR MCL

01:14:46.415 --> 01:14:49.084
COMPLIANCE PLAN. CHROMIUM IS A

01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:50.586
NATURALLY OCCURRING METAL FOUND

01:14:50.652 --> 01:14:52.855
IN THE EARTH'S CRUST. UNDER

01:14:52.921 --> 01:14:55.023
CERTAIN CONDITIONS, CHROMIUM

01:14:55.090 --> 01:14:57.159
THREE CAN OXIDIZE TO CHROMIUM

01:14:57.226 --> 01:14:59.661
SIX, WHILE CHROMIUM SIX IS MOST

01:14:59.728 --> 01:15:01.430
DANGEROUS WHEN INHALED, IT IS

01:15:01.496 --> 01:15:04.666
ALSO TOXIC WHEN INGESTED IN HIGH

01:15:04.733 --> 01:15:05.767
CONCENTRATIONS OVER A LONG

01:15:05.834 --> 01:15:07.903
PERIOD OF TIME. THE EXACT HEALTH

01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:10.072
RISKS OF LOW LEVEL DRINKING

01:15:10.138 --> 01:15:12.274
WATER EXPOSURE REMAIN A SUBJECT

01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:14.343
OF ONGOING SCIENTIFIC

01:15:14.409 --> 01:15:16.778
INVESTIGATION AND DISPUTE. IN

01:15:16.845 --> 01:15:18.647
2014, THE STATE WATER RESOURCES

01:15:18.714 --> 01:15:21.683
CONTROL BOARD ADOPTED A CHROMIUM

01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:23.585
SIX MCL AT TEN PARTS PER BILLION

01:15:23.652 --> 01:15:25.954
IN DRINKING WATER, AN AMOUNT

01:15:26.021 --> 01:15:27.322
FIVE TIMES LOWER THAN

01:15:27.389 --> 01:15:29.291
CALIFORNIA'S STANDARD AND TEN

01:15:29.358 --> 01:15:30.692
TIMES LOWER THAN THE U.S.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

01:15:32.427 --> 01:15:34.296
STANDARD FOR TOTAL CHROMIUM

01:15:34.363 --> 01:15:36.265
ALLOWED THE NEW REGULATION,

01:15:36.331 --> 01:15:39.468
EFFECTIVE 2024, PROVIDES PUBLIC

01:15:39.534 --> 01:15:41.403
WATER SYSTEMS WITH A LIMITED

01:15:41.470 --> 01:15:43.338
COMPLIANCE PERIOD TO MEET THE

01:15:43.405 --> 01:15:45.440
NEW CHROME SIX STANDARD OF TEN

01:15:45.507 --> 01:15:47.876
PPB, DEPENDING ON THE NUMBER OF

01:15:47.943 --> 01:15:49.578
CONNECTIONS, PUBLIC WATER

01:15:49.645 --> 01:15:51.480
SYSTEMS MUST COMPLY WITH THIS

01:15:51.546 --> 01:15:53.382
NEW STANDARD AS SOON AS OCTOBER

01:15:53.448 --> 01:15:57.052
1ST, 2026 TO OCTOBER 1ST, 2028.

01:15:57.119 --> 01:15:58.487
AND IT DEPENDS ON YOUR THE SIZE

01:15:58.553 --> 01:16:00.455
OF YOUR SYSTEM. ACHIEVING

01:16:00.522 --> 01:16:02.057
COMPLIANCE WITHIN THIS TIME

01:16:02.124 --> 01:16:03.892
FRAME IS SIMPLY NOT FEASIBLE FOR

01:16:03.959 --> 01:16:05.894
MANY WATER SYSTEMS. DUE TO THE

01:16:05.961 --> 01:16:07.596
NEED FOR SIGNIFICANT

01:16:07.663 --> 01:16:09.464
INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES AND THE

01:16:09.531 --> 01:16:11.366

WATER SYSTEMS ENGINEERING

01:16:13.435 --> 01:16:14.770
FEASIBILITY STUDIES INDICATE

01:16:14.836 --> 01:16:17.039
THAT THE REALISTIC TIME REQUIRED

01:16:17.105 --> 01:16:19.574
TO PLAN, DESIGN, PERMIT, AND

01:16:19.641 --> 01:16:22.110

TO COMPLY IS BEST CASE BETWEEN 4

01:16:24.279 --> 01:16:26.848
TO 6 YEARS. LET ME BE VERY CLEAR

01:16:26.915 --> 01:16:28.250
WATER PROVIDERS DO NOT SEEK

01:16:28.317 --> 01:16:29.651
RELIEF FROM ENFORCEMENT BY THE

01:16:29.718 --> 01:16:31.887
STATE WATER BOARD. NO, NOR ARE

01:16:31.954 --> 01:16:34.156

TO COMPLY WITH THE CHROMIUM SIX

01:16:36.124 --> 01:16:37.893
MCL. WATER PROVIDERS DO,

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:39.294
HOWEVER, HAVE GREAT CONCERN

01:16:39.361 --> 01:16:41.830
ABOUT POTENTIAL THIRD PARTY

01:16:41.897 --> 01:16:43.332
LITIGATION, PARTICULARLY AFTER

01:16:43.398 --> 01:16:45.901
THE WATER SYSTEMS PROVIDE A

01:16:45.968 --> 01:16:48.203
PUBLIC NOTICE OF EXCEEDANCE OF

01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:50.706
THE MCL. AS IS REQUIRED BY STATE

01:16:50.772 --> 01:16:52.574
LAW, ANY LITIGATION MUST BE

DEFENDED AT GREAT COST AND

01:16:54.109 --> 01:16:55.544
EXPENSE TO WATER PROVIDERS,

01:16:55.610 --> 01:16:57.346
REGARDLESS OF THEIR

01:17:02.451 --> 01:17:03.685
COMPLIANCE. THESE ARE COSTS THAT

01:17:03.752 --> 01:17:05.187
WILL BE PAID BY THE RATEPAYERS.

01:17:05.253 --> 01:17:07.222
IN OTHER WORDS, THE LITIGATION.

01:17:07.289 --> 01:17:09.524

NOT PERMANENTLY SHIELD THE WATER

PROVIDER FROM HARM CAUSED, AND

01:18:03.578 --> 01:18:06.014
DOES NOT AFFECT IN ANY WAY THE

STATE WATER BOARD OR THE

01:18:07.249 --> 01:18:08.884
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S ROBUST

01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:11.753
ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY. SB 466 IS

01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:13.655
A REASONABLE AND TEMPORARY

01:18:13.722 --> 01:18:14.656
MEASURE TO PROTECT WATER

01:18:14.723 --> 01:18:16.892
PROVIDERS FROM UNNECESSARY

01:18:16.958 --> 01:18:18.193
LITIGATION AND TO ALLOW THEM TO

STAY FOCUSED ON PROVIDING SAFE

01:18:19.828 --> 01:18:21.563
AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER IN

01:18:21.630 --> 01:18:23.698

THIS EFFORT. IT MAY MAKE SENSE

01:18:36.545 --> 01:18:37.312
TO GO IN THAT DIRECTION, BUT I

01:18:37.379 --> 01:18:38.580
THINK THERE'S MORE CONVERSATIONS

01:18:38.647 --> 01:18:40.248
THAT NEED TO BE HAVE HAD IN

01:18:40.315 --> 01:18:42.918

HERE BEFORE YOU AS A CO-SPONSOR

01:19:13.715 --> 01:19:17.819
OF SB 466, A BILL THAT IS

01:19:17.886 --> 01:19:19.821
CRITICAL AND CRUCIAL TO THE

01:19:19.888 --> 01:19:21.690
IMPORTANCE TO SMALL CITIES LIKE

01:19:21.756 --> 01:19:23.725
MINE. LIKE MANY OTHER SMALL

01:19:23.792 --> 01:19:25.327
COMMUNITIES IN OUR REGION, WE

01:19:25.393 --> 01:19:26.962
ARE FACING A UNIQUE CHALLENGE.

01:19:27.028 --> 01:19:28.430
OUR WATER SUPPLY CONTAINS

01:19:28.497 --> 01:19:30.599
NATURALLY OCCURRING CHROMIUM

01:19:30.665 --> 01:19:31.600
SIX, NOT BECAUSE OF ANY

01:19:31.666 --> 01:19:35.337
INTENTIONAL OR ACTION, BUT DUE

01:19:35.403 --> 01:19:36.738
TO THE GEOLOGY OF OUR

01:19:36.805 --> 01:19:38.740
GROUNDWATER BASIN. LOS BANOS

01:19:38.807 --> 01:19:41.009
SERVES A POPULATION OF 50,000

01:19:41.076 --> 01:19:42.978
AND IS CONSIDERED A

01:19:43.044 --> 01:19:45.347
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY. THE NEW

01:19:45.413 --> 01:19:47.883
MAXIMUM CONTAMINANT LEVELS OF

01:19:47.949 --> 01:19:49.584
CHROMIUM SIX IS NOW SET AT TEN

01:19:49.651 --> 01:19:51.520
PARTS PER BILLION, WHICH IS MUCH

01:19:51.586 --> 01:19:53.188
STRICTER THAN PREVIOUS FEDERAL

01:19:53.255 --> 01:19:55.757
OR STATE STANDARDS. CURRENTLY,

01:19:55.824 --> 01:19:58.727
EACH ONE OF OUR MUNICIPAL WELLS

01:19:58.793 --> 01:20:01.429
EXCEED THE NEW THRESHOLD. IT'S

01:20:01.496 --> 01:20:03.064
IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT THE

01:20:03.131 --> 01:20:04.933
STATE WATER BOARD HAS PREVIOUSLY

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.068
STATED THAT CHROMIUM SIX LEVELS

01:20:07.135 --> 01:20:09.204
BELOW THE FORMER 50 PARTS PER

01:20:09.271 --> 01:20:11.540
BILLION, DO NOT CREATE AN ACUTE

01:20:11.606 --> 01:20:13.808
HEALTH HAZARD. STILL, LOS BANOS

01:20:13.875 --> 01:20:15.911
IS FULLY COMMITTED TO PROTECTING

01:20:15.977 --> 01:20:17.879
THE HEALTH OF OUR RESIDENTS AND

01:20:17.946 --> 01:20:19.814
MEETING THIS NEW STANDARD.

01:20:19.881 --> 01:20:22.083
HOWEVER, COMPLIANCE WILL REQUIRE

01:20:22.150 --> 01:20:23.451
SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IN NEW

01:20:23.518 --> 01:20:26.087
TREATMENT PLANTS INFRASTRUCTURE

01:20:26.154 --> 01:20:29.090
THAT WE ESTIMATE BEING OVER $65

01:20:29.157 --> 01:20:31.226
MILLION FOR OUR SMALL COMMUNITY.

01:20:31.293 --> 01:20:33.428
FOR A COMMUNITY LIKE OURS, THE

01:20:33.495 --> 01:20:36.464
EXPENSE WOULD BE ENORMOUS. THAT

01:20:36.531 --> 01:20:39.734
IS WHY SB 466 IS SO VITAL. IT

01:20:39.801 --> 01:20:41.169
WILL PROTECT CITIES LIKE LOS

01:20:41.236 --> 01:20:43.672
BANOS FROM COSTLY AND OFTEN

01:20:43.738 --> 01:20:45.840
UNJUSTIFIED THIRD PARTY

01:20:45.907 --> 01:20:47.242
LAWSUITS. THESE LAWSUITS CAN

01:20:47.309 --> 01:20:49.444
DRAIN RESOURCES AWAY FROM

01:20:49.511 --> 01:20:51.680
PLANNING AND BUILDING OUR WATER

01:20:51.746 --> 01:20:53.748
SYSTEM FOR TREATING THIS NEED.

01:20:53.815 --> 01:20:58.453
SB 466 IS NARROWLY FOCUSED. IT

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.488
WILL PROVIDE LEGAL PROTECTION

01:21:00.555 --> 01:21:02.624
FOR AGENCIES THAT ARE ACTIVELY

01:21:02.691 --> 01:21:04.459

ALWAYS BEEN IN COMPLIANCE WITH

01:21:54.909 --> 01:21:57.078
DRINKING WATER STANDARDS,

01:21:57.145 --> 01:21:58.513
BECAUSE CHROMIUM SIX IS

01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:01.116
NATURALLY OCCURRING IN THE

01:22:01.182 --> 01:22:04.319

01:22:06.621 --> 01:22:07.889
COMPLETELY BY OUR RATEPAYERS,

01:22:07.956 --> 01:22:10.759
THE CUSTOMERS WHICH WILL

01:22:10.825 --> 01:22:12.560
CHALLENGE AFFORDABILITY IN OUR

THE COACHELLA VALLEY IS IN

01:22:20.101 --> 01:22:22.270
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THIS

01:22:22.337 --> 01:22:24.205
BILL IS NEEDED TO ENABLE WATER

01:22:24.272 --> 01:22:25.573
PROVIDERS TO STAY FOCUSED ON

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:28.176
CHROMIUM SIX COMPLIANCE, AND NOT

01:22:28.243 --> 01:22:30.578
DIVERT RESOURCES TO EXPENSIVE

01:22:30.645 --> 01:22:33.848
LITIGATION. STEVE ANTICIPATES

01:22:33.915 --> 01:22:37.585
SPENDING $400 MILLION UPFRONT TO

COMPLY WITH CHROMIUM SIX

01:22:39.621 --> 01:22:41.790
COMPLIANCE. THIS WILL INCLUDE

FACILITIES. DOMESTIC WATER RATES

01:22:49.831 --> 01:22:52.634
ARE EXPECTED TO DOUBLE JUST FOR

01:22:52.701 --> 01:22:55.837
CHROMIUM SIX COMPLIANCE. THIS

01:22:55.904 --> 01:22:57.706
LEGISLATION IMPROVES THE

01:22:57.772 --> 01:22:58.340

01:25:44.906 --> 01:25:47.342
2024, THE STATE WATER BOARD SETS

01:25:47.408 --> 01:25:50.778
THE MAXIMUM CONTAMINATION LEVEL

01:25:50.845 --> 01:25:55.550
TO BE 0.010MG/L FOR

01:25:55.617 --> 01:25:56.484
CONTAMINATION OF CHROME SIX. BUT

01:25:56.551 --> 01:25:58.353
IS THERE BEEN ANY SINCE THEN,

01:25:58.419 --> 01:25:59.387
ANY LITIGATION OR THREAT OF

01:25:59.454 --> 01:26:01.055
LITIGATION THAT WOULD

01:26:01.122 --> 01:26:02.924
NECESSITATE LEGISLATION LIKE

01:26:02.991 --> 01:26:08.029
THIS? SO WE MIGHT WANT TO HAVE

01:26:08.096 --> 01:26:09.998
MARY LYNN COFFEY SPEAK TO THAT.

01:26:10.064 --> 01:26:13.301
OKAY. THERE HAS BEEN LITIGATION.

01:26:13.368 --> 01:26:16.271
THERE HAS. OKAY. YEAH. WELL,

01:26:16.337 --> 01:26:17.739
THERE WAS LITIGATION

01:26:17.805 --> 01:26:20.074
HISTORICALLY. THE CHROME SIX MCL

01:26:20.141 --> 01:26:21.709
TAKES EFFECT. IN OTHER WORDS,

01:26:21.776 --> 01:26:24.579
YOU CAN BE IN VIOLATION OF IT

01:26:24.646 --> 01:26:26.114
FOR EXCEEDING IT, WHICH WOULD

01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:27.582
THEN LEAD TO A THIRD PARTY

01:26:27.649 --> 01:26:30.051
CITIZEN SUIT IN OCTOBER OF 2026.

01:26:30.118 --> 01:26:31.619
SO AT THIS TIME, SUCH A LAWSUIT

01:26:31.686 --> 01:26:35.823
WOULD BE PREMATURE. OKAY. RIGHT.

01:26:35.890 --> 01:26:37.158
OKAY. SO IT TAKES EFFECT IN

01:26:37.225 --> 01:26:39.627
2020, OCTOBER 2026 AND HAS YET

01:26:39.694 --> 01:26:40.728
TO MANIFEST ANY SORT OF.

01:26:40.795 --> 01:26:42.196
CORRECT. RIGHT NOW WE'RE

01:26:42.263 --> 01:26:45.099
REPORTING EXCEEDANCES, BUT THE

01:26:45.166 --> 01:26:49.003
MCL IS NOT YOU WOULD NOT BE IN

01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:50.872
VIOLATION. YOU JUST REPORT THE

01:26:50.939 --> 01:26:52.574
EXCEEDANCE. SO EVERYBODY KNOWS

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:55.777
TODAY WHOSE WATER WELLS EXCEED.

01:26:55.843 --> 01:26:58.746
BUT UNDER THE RULE, THE MAXIMUM

01:26:58.813 --> 01:27:01.282
CONTAMINANT LEVEL RULE, THEN YOU

01:27:01.349 --> 01:27:03.785
DON'T HAVE A VIOLATION THAT'S

01:27:03.851 --> 01:27:06.054
ACTIONABLE UNTIL OCTOBER OF

01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:07.355
2026, WHICH IS WHY WE'RE BEFORE

01:27:07.422 --> 01:27:09.490
YOU NOW, HOPING TO PREVENT THOSE

01:27:09.557 --> 01:27:11.492
CITIZEN SUITS BEFORE THE

01:27:11.559 --> 01:27:13.494
VIOLATIONS BECOME ACTIONABLE.

01:27:13.561 --> 01:27:15.697
OKAY, CORRECT. AND I KNOW I

01:27:15.763 --> 01:27:17.165
UNDERSTAND THE LOGIC OF THE

01:27:17.231 --> 01:27:19.067
BILL. AND I KNOW, SENATOR, YOU

01:27:19.133 --> 01:27:19.601
WERE LITERALLY WALKING AND

01:27:19.667 --> 01:27:21.069
TALKING ABOUT ALL THE AMENDMENTS

01:27:21.135 --> 01:27:22.704
AND THINGS YOU'RE WORKING ON

01:27:22.770 --> 01:27:23.905
THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE AND THE

01:27:23.972 --> 01:27:24.539
COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY. BUT

01:27:24.606 --> 01:27:27.475
IT DOES IT DOES CONCERN ME A BIT

01:27:27.542 --> 01:27:29.110
THAT WE'RE DOING A BLANKET

01:27:29.177 --> 01:27:30.478
EXEMPTION THAN EVEN WHAT ARE WE

01:27:30.545 --> 01:27:32.547
TALKING ABOUT? SAYING IS WHEN AN

01:27:32.614 --> 01:27:34.248
ACTION IS VIOLATION. I KNOW

01:27:34.315 --> 01:27:35.383
THERE HAS BEEN SOME OPPOSITION

01:27:35.450 --> 01:27:36.884
LANGUAGE ABOUT CHANGING AND

01:27:36.951 --> 01:27:38.086
MORPHING SOME OF THE LANGUAGE,

01:27:38.152 --> 01:27:39.487
WHICH IS STILL THE SAME INTENT

01:27:39.554 --> 01:27:42.123
ABOUT THAT. HAVE HAVE YOU TALKED

01:27:42.190 --> 01:27:43.891
ABOUT, I DON'T KNOW IF I MISSED

01:27:43.958 --> 01:27:45.393
THE COMMITTEE ABOUT CHANGING THE

01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:46.394
LANGUAGE TO BE INSTEAD OF A

01:27:46.461 --> 01:27:48.096
BLANKET EXEMPTION TO BE ABOUT

01:27:48.162 --> 01:27:50.865
NOT TO BE FOUND IN VIOLATION

01:27:50.932 --> 01:27:55.036
LANGUAGE. I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY

01:27:55.103 --> 01:27:56.771
WHAT LANGUAGE YOU'RE YOU WOULD

01:27:56.838 --> 01:27:58.206
REFER TO. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:27:58.272 --> 01:28:01.376
DO IS WE HAVE VERY NARROWLY

01:28:01.442 --> 01:28:04.612
CRAFTED THE BILL SO THAT THAT

01:28:04.679 --> 01:28:07.915
ONCE THE BECAUSE IT'S, IT'S OUR

01:28:07.982 --> 01:28:10.251
BELIEF THAT ONCE THE PUBLIC GETS

01:28:10.318 --> 01:28:12.020
A NOTICE IN THE MAIL, WHICH IS

01:28:12.086 --> 01:28:13.388
REQUIRED BY THE STATE WATER

01:28:13.454 --> 01:28:16.991
BOARD THAT SAYS YOUR WATER

01:28:17.058 --> 01:28:19.827
SYSTEM EXCEEDS THE MCL LEVEL FOR

01:28:19.894 --> 01:28:21.896
CHROMIUM SIX, THAT HAS BEEN

01:28:21.963 --> 01:28:25.833
DETERMINED TO BE A CERTAIN A

01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:27.468
CERTAIN NUMBER, RIGHT, TEN PARTS

01:28:27.535 --> 01:28:29.971
PER BILLION THAT THAT THAT THAT

01:28:30.038 --> 01:28:32.073
IS WHAT STIRS LITIGATION AGAINST

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:35.710
WATER AGENCIES BECAUSE PEOPLE

01:28:35.777 --> 01:28:37.245
ARE ON NOTICE. AND ALL WE'RE

01:28:37.311 --> 01:28:40.281
TRYING TO DO IS TO SAY NOT ONLY

01:28:40.348 --> 01:28:42.417
HAVE THEY BEEN ADVISED, HAVE THE

01:28:42.483 --> 01:28:44.986
WATER AGENCIES BEEN ADVISED THAT

01:28:45.053 --> 01:28:47.588
THE CHROMIUM LEVEL HAS DROPPED

01:28:47.655 --> 01:28:51.359
FROM 50 TO 10 PARTS PER BILLION,

01:28:51.426 --> 01:28:53.828
AND NOW YOU MUST COME UP WITH A

01:28:53.895 --> 01:28:57.632
PLAN TO FIX IT, AND YOU HAVE TO

01:28:57.699 --> 01:29:00.001
FILE THAT PLAN WITH THE WITH THE

01:29:00.068 --> 01:29:00.835
DEPARTMENT, THE STATE WATER

01:29:00.902 --> 01:29:03.371
BOARD. AND THEN YOU HAVE TO

01:29:03.438 --> 01:29:05.807
START. AND THAT PLAN HAS TO HAVE

01:29:05.873 --> 01:29:07.275
A TIMELINE THAT SAYS, HERE'S

01:29:07.341 --> 01:29:08.376
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO, HERE'S

01:29:08.443 --> 01:29:10.678
HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IT, HERE'S

01:29:10.745 --> 01:29:12.180
HOW WE'RE GOING TO PAY FOR IT,

01:29:12.246 --> 01:29:15.183
AND HERE'S THE TIMELINE FOR IT.

01:29:15.249 --> 01:29:16.984
THEY THAT ALL THAT HAS TO BE

01:29:17.051 --> 01:29:18.953
THEN APPROVED BY THE WATER BOARD

01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:23.224
AS A VALID PLAN. AND BETWEEN THE

01:29:23.291 --> 01:29:26.728
TIME THAT THAT PLAN IS APPROVED

01:29:26.794 --> 01:29:30.031
AND THE TIME THAT THEY FINISH

01:29:30.098 --> 01:29:33.301
DOING THE UPGRADE, YOU CAN'T BE

01:29:33.367 --> 01:29:36.471
SUED FOR THE REDUCTION IN FOR,

01:29:36.537 --> 01:29:38.239
FOR NOT MEETING THE LEVEL

01:29:38.306 --> 01:29:39.707
BECAUSE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO MEET

01:29:39.774 --> 01:29:41.843
THE LEVEL LIKE THAT. YOU HAVE TO

01:29:41.909 --> 01:29:43.911
BUILD, YOU HAVE TO REDO, YOU

01:29:43.978 --> 01:29:45.813
HAVE TO REPIPE. IT COSTS IT

01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:47.715
COSTS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT

01:29:47.782 --> 01:29:49.317
DURING THAT TIME THE FOCUS WILL

01:29:49.383 --> 01:29:51.619
BE ON FIX, ON COMING UP TO

01:29:51.686 --> 01:29:53.554
COMPLIANCE AS OPPOSED TO GOING

01:29:53.621 --> 01:29:55.456
INTO COURT AND DEFENDING

01:29:55.523 --> 01:29:56.924
DEFENDING IT. AND THAT'S,

01:29:56.991 --> 01:29:59.293
THAT'S, THAT'S THAT'S ALL THAT

01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:01.929
IT'S THAT TIME PERIOD. AND IN

01:30:01.996 --> 01:30:04.165
ADDITION, IF IT ENDS UP THAT

01:30:04.232 --> 01:30:06.267
SOMEONE BELIEVES THAT THEY HAVE

01:30:06.334 --> 01:30:10.671
BEEN INJURED BECAUSE OF THE

01:30:10.738 --> 01:30:16.344
CHROMIUM, THEY CAN STILL SUE.

01:30:16.410 --> 01:30:18.146
NOW I DRAW A BLANK. YOU CAN

01:30:18.212 --> 01:30:21.115
STILL SUE, BUT YOU HAVE TO.

01:30:21.182 --> 01:30:22.150
THOSE WERE PART OF THE

01:30:22.216 --> 01:30:23.184
AMENDMENTS AND I'M DRAWING A

01:30:23.251 --> 01:30:26.187
BLANK ON IT RIGHT NOW. YOU HAVE

01:30:26.254 --> 01:30:26.754
TO. SO THERE WAS AFTER THE

01:30:26.821 --> 01:30:28.256
SENATE COMMITTEE HEARING

01:30:28.322 --> 01:30:30.491
HEARINGS, THERE WAS A PROVISION.

01:30:30.558 --> 01:30:32.894
IT WAS AMENDED. THE BILL WAS

01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:34.695
AMENDED TO INCLUDE A PROVISION

01:30:34.762 --> 01:30:35.763
THAT SAYS THIS SECTION ONLY

01:30:35.830 --> 01:30:37.732
APPLIES TO PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS

01:30:37.799 --> 01:30:39.400
THAT MEET THE TOTAL CHROME

01:30:39.467 --> 01:30:41.402
CHROMIUM MCL ENFORCEABLE

01:30:41.469 --> 01:30:43.771
STANDARD FOR DRINKING WATER. SO

01:30:43.838 --> 01:30:45.640
THAT WAS THE AMENDMENT AFTER THE

01:30:45.706 --> 01:30:47.341
LAST COMMITTEE HEARING. AND I

01:30:47.408 --> 01:30:48.609
BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT THAT'S

01:30:48.676 --> 01:30:50.444
RIGHT. AND I WOULD JUST SAY IS

01:30:50.511 --> 01:30:52.079
THAT I DEFINITELY WANT OUR

01:30:52.146 --> 01:30:53.414
WATER, OUR WATER SUPPLIERS TO BE

01:30:53.481 --> 01:30:54.749
IN COMPLIANCE. AND I UNDERSTAND

01:30:54.816 --> 01:30:56.884
THE ASPECT OF WHEN YOU'RE IN THE

01:30:56.951 --> 01:30:57.485
PROCESS OF COMPLIANCE, YOU'RE

01:30:57.552 --> 01:30:58.352
WORRIED ABOUT THAT LITIGATION

01:30:58.419 --> 01:31:01.789
THAT IS HAPPENING. I JUST. FIND

01:31:01.856 --> 01:31:03.558
SOME CONCERN ABOUT IT, ABOUT A

01:31:03.624 --> 01:31:05.059
BLANKET EXEMPTION EVEN DURING

01:31:05.126 --> 01:31:06.727
THAT PERIOD, BECAUSE THESE

01:31:06.794 --> 01:31:07.662
PERIODS HAVE COME INTO

01:31:07.728 --> 01:31:08.996
COMPLIANCE. DO TAKE SOME TIME.

01:31:09.063 --> 01:31:10.298
IT COULD BE FOR SIX YEARS EVEN.

01:31:10.364 --> 01:31:12.400
AND I DON'T WANT PEOPLE WHO DO

01:31:12.466 --> 01:31:15.069
FEEL AGGRIEVED OR HARMED BY

01:31:15.136 --> 01:31:17.538
CHROMIUM SIX, WHICH IS AN ACTIVE

01:31:17.605 --> 01:31:18.139
HEAVY METAL CARCINOGEN, THAT

01:31:18.206 --> 01:31:19.407
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE ANY RECOURSE

01:31:19.473 --> 01:31:21.209
OF IT IF THERE WAS SOME ACTOR IN

01:31:21.275 --> 01:31:23.444
THERE, OUT THERE DOING SOMETHING

01:31:23.511 --> 01:31:24.078
DELIBERATELY UNSAVORY OUT THERE

01:31:24.145 --> 01:31:26.113
AND HURTING PEOPLE. THAT'S WHY I

01:31:26.180 --> 01:31:28.015
JUST POINT THAT ASPECT OUT. I

01:31:28.082 --> 01:31:29.350
KNOW, SENATOR, CONTINUE TO WORK

01:31:29.417 --> 01:31:30.551
ON A LOT OF AMENDMENTS AND

01:31:30.618 --> 01:31:31.552
THINGS. IT'S GOING TO IN

01:31:31.619 --> 01:31:33.254
DIFFERENT COMMITTEES. THAT IS

01:31:33.321 --> 01:31:34.422
THE AMENDMENT THAT WE TOOK IN,

01:31:34.488 --> 01:31:36.357
IN, IN THE SENATE IS THAT IF

01:31:36.424 --> 01:31:37.892
THERE IS SOMEONE WHO CAN ALLEGE

01:31:37.959 --> 01:31:38.659
AN INJURY THAT THE ATTORNEY

01:31:38.726 --> 01:31:43.164
GENERAL CAN BRING LAWSUIT AS A

01:31:43.231 --> 01:31:45.233
LAWSUIT, BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE

01:31:45.299 --> 01:31:47.001
BEEN I MEAN, THE WHOLE IDEA IS

01:31:47.068 --> 01:31:49.337
YOU HAVE TO BE A GOOD ACTOR. YOU

01:31:49.403 --> 01:31:52.874
HAVE TO HAVE MET THE 50 AND THEN

01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:54.709
YOU YOU HAVE TO HAVE A

01:31:54.775 --> 01:31:56.510
COMPLIANCE PLAN AND EVERYTHING

01:31:56.577 --> 01:31:58.312
HAS TO BE APPROVED. BUT THE AG

01:31:58.379 --> 01:32:00.348
CAN STILL FILE A LAWSUIT IF

01:32:00.414 --> 01:32:03.050
THERE IS AN INJURY. OKAY. RIGHT.

01:32:03.117 --> 01:32:05.219
AND I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY, AS

01:32:05.286 --> 01:32:07.455
I'M LEAVING A LOT OF THESE

01:32:07.521 --> 01:32:08.422
COMMENTS HERE ON THE, ON THE

01:32:08.489 --> 01:32:09.624
DAIS BECAUSE I UNLIKE SOME OF MY

01:32:09.690 --> 01:32:10.524
COLLEAGUES, I'M NOT IN

01:32:10.591 --> 01:32:12.126
JUDICIARY, SO I WON'T HAVE A

01:32:12.193 --> 01:32:14.228
SECOND BITE TO REEXAMINE SOME OF

01:32:14.295 --> 01:32:15.529
THESE THINGS. SO I WANTED TO

01:32:15.596 --> 01:32:16.497
HIGHLIGHT MY CONCERNS. AND I

01:32:16.564 --> 01:32:17.565
APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS BECAUSE

01:32:17.632 --> 01:32:19.133
THEY WERE REFLECTED IN SOME OF

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:20.601
THE ISSUES RAISED IN THE SENATE

01:32:20.668 --> 01:32:22.303
AS WELL. AND WE DID TAKE AN

01:32:22.370 --> 01:32:23.738
AMENDMENT IN REGARDS TO THAT.

01:32:23.804 --> 01:32:25.573
ABSOLUTELY. THEN IN ADDITION, I

01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:26.340
THINK THERE ARE ALSO REFLECTED

01:32:26.407 --> 01:32:27.742
IN WHAT THE SENATOR MENTIONED IN

01:32:27.808 --> 01:32:28.376
HER OPENING REMARKS BEFORE YOU

01:32:28.442 --> 01:32:30.811
WERE ABLE TO JOIN. IF YOU LOOK

01:32:30.878 --> 01:32:33.214
AT PAGE SIX OF THE ANALYSIS,

01:32:33.281 --> 01:32:35.583
THERE IS KIND OF AN ALTERNATIVE

01:32:35.650 --> 01:32:42.623
FRAMEWORK AKIN TO WHAT WAS SB

01:32:42.690 --> 01:32:46.227
385 BACK IN THE DAY. SO IT WOULD

01:32:46.294 --> 01:32:48.362
NOT BE SO MUCH A BLANKET

01:32:48.429 --> 01:32:50.231
EXEMPTION FROM CIVIL LIABILITY,

01:32:50.298 --> 01:32:52.833
BUT MORE SOMETHING AKIN TO THE

01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:54.201
PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM. AND WE ALL

01:32:54.268 --> 01:32:56.237
GET THE CHALLENGES, BUT SHALL

01:32:56.304 --> 01:32:58.372
NOT BE DEEMED IN VIOLATION OF

01:32:58.439 --> 01:33:00.207
THE PRIMARY DRINKING WATER

01:33:00.274 --> 01:33:03.477
STANDARD WHILE IMPLEMENTING AN

01:33:03.544 --> 01:33:04.578
APPROVED COMPLIANCE PLAN. BUT

01:33:04.645 --> 01:33:06.414
YOU'VE COMMITTED TO KIND OF

01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:08.449
CONTINUING DISCUSSION WITH THAT.

01:33:08.516 --> 01:33:11.452
YOU HAVE A FOLLOW UP OR ASSEMBLY

01:33:11.519 --> 01:33:13.321
MEMBER. OKAY, GREAT. I JUST

01:33:13.387 --> 01:33:14.956
WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WAS THE

01:33:15.022 --> 01:33:16.123
TIMELINE FOR THE EXEMPTION. IS

01:33:16.190 --> 01:33:17.525
THERE A TIMELINE LIKE IS IT TWO

01:33:17.591 --> 01:33:19.760
YEARS? IS IT THREE YEARS? IS IT

01:33:19.827 --> 01:33:21.462
FOUR YEARS? IT'S DURING THE TIME

01:33:21.529 --> 01:33:23.364
THAT THAT THEY'RE WORKING ON THE

01:33:23.431 --> 01:33:25.933
ON THE PLAN AND THAT THE PLAN IS

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.201
COMPLETE. AND SO THE PLAN HAS TO

01:33:27.268 --> 01:33:29.236
BE APPROVED BY THE WATER BOARD.

01:33:29.303 --> 01:33:30.471
AND THE WATER BOARD WILL DECIDE

01:33:30.538 --> 01:33:33.107
WHETHER IT'S A TWO YEAR OR FOUR

01:33:33.174 --> 01:33:35.476
YEAR OR FIVE YEAR PLAN. AND IT'S

01:33:35.543 --> 01:33:37.678
DURING THE PENDENCY. BUT THEY

01:33:37.745 --> 01:33:42.683
HAVE TO THEY HAVE TO MEET THE

01:33:42.750 --> 01:33:44.585
MILESTONES IN ORDER TO BE ABLE

01:33:44.652 --> 01:33:46.988
TO STILL BE COMPLIANT. THANK YOU

01:33:47.054 --> 01:33:50.257
FOR THAT QUESTION. ASSEMBLY

01:33:50.324 --> 01:33:52.393
MEMBER. THANK YOU, SENATOR, AND

01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:54.829
I THINK I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT

01:33:54.895 --> 01:33:56.163
THAT IT SEEMS LIKE HAS REALLY

01:33:56.230 --> 01:33:57.999
GONE INTO THIS BILL TO BALANCE

01:33:58.065 --> 01:33:59.600
PROTECTING COMMUNITIES WITH

01:33:59.667 --> 01:34:00.935
ENSURING WATER SYSTEMS CAN DO

01:34:01.002 --> 01:34:03.104
WHAT THEIR JOB IS, WHICH IS TO

01:34:03.170 --> 01:34:06.741
PROVIDE CLEAN DRINKING WATER.

01:34:06.807 --> 01:34:08.209
ONE QUESTION WAS, YOU SAID THAT

01:34:08.275 --> 01:34:10.044
IF THERE IS AN INJURY, IN FACT,

01:34:10.111 --> 01:34:11.912
MAYBE THIS IS A BETTER QUESTION

01:34:11.979 --> 01:34:13.314
FOR JUDICIARY AND I AM ON

01:34:13.381 --> 01:34:14.582
JUDICIARY. BUT JUST SINCE IT

01:34:14.648 --> 01:34:16.183
CAME UP, I WANTED TO ADDRESS IT.

01:34:16.250 --> 01:34:17.551
IF THERE IS AN INJURY, IN FACT,

01:34:17.618 --> 01:34:20.054
THEN THE AG CAN BRING AN ACTION,

01:34:20.121 --> 01:34:20.721
BUT THE INDIVIDUAL DOESN'T HAVE

01:34:20.788 --> 01:34:22.757
A RIGHT TO BRING A CIVIL ACTION.

01:34:22.823 --> 01:34:24.392
NO, IT'S THROUGH THE AG'S

01:34:24.458 --> 01:34:27.261
OFFICE. SO IF THE AG BRINGS THAT

01:34:27.328 --> 01:34:30.765
ACTION, USUALLY DAMAGES BY A

01:34:30.831 --> 01:34:33.267
PUBLIC PROSECUTOR DO NOT INCLUDE

01:34:33.334 --> 01:34:35.569
REAL DAMAGES FOR MEDICAL BILLS

01:34:35.636 --> 01:34:37.538
AND OTHER THINGS. SO I GUESS

01:34:37.605 --> 01:34:39.707
THAT WOULD BE MY CONCERN. YEAH.

01:34:39.774 --> 01:34:41.642
NO, I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT'S

01:34:41.709 --> 01:34:43.144
ANTICIPATED. OKAY. WE CAN TAKE A

01:34:43.210 --> 01:34:45.179
LOOK AT IT. OKAY. JUDICIARY. BUT

01:34:45.246 --> 01:34:47.481
BUT I'M NOT THIS THIS IS ALREADY

01:34:47.548 --> 01:34:50.084
STATE LAW OKAY. AND WE'RE WE'RE

01:34:50.151 --> 01:34:52.119
NOT CHANGING THE ABILITY OF THE

01:34:52.186 --> 01:34:54.055
AG TO BRING LAWSUITS ON BEHALF

01:34:54.121 --> 01:34:57.124
OF WATER ON ON BEHALF OF, OF THE

01:34:57.191 --> 01:34:59.727
PUBLIC. RIGHT. AND MAYBE I JUST

01:34:59.794 --> 01:35:01.362
NEED TO LOOK FURTHER INTO IT.

01:35:01.429 --> 01:35:03.531
BUT THAT WOULD BE MY QUESTION

01:35:03.597 --> 01:35:04.098
AND I GUESS I CAN RAISE IT

01:35:04.165 --> 01:35:06.067
AGAIN, JUDICIARY, WHICH IS JUST

01:35:06.133 --> 01:35:07.468
ENSURING THAT IF THERE IS ACTUAL

01:35:07.535 --> 01:35:09.637
INJURY, WHICH I THINK IS YOUR

01:35:09.703 --> 01:35:10.371
GOAL, THAT NOT ONLY IS THE AG

01:35:10.438 --> 01:35:12.106
ABLE TO BRING AN ACTION TO

01:35:12.173 --> 01:35:13.174
PUNISH, BUT THAT ALSO AN

01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:15.209
INDIVIDUAL IS HARMED, CAN GET

01:35:15.276 --> 01:35:15.976
THOSE MEDICAL BILLS PAID AND

01:35:16.043 --> 01:35:17.378
THEIR PAIN AND SUFFERING AND ALL

01:35:17.445 --> 01:35:19.580
THE THINGS THEY DESERVE AS WELL.

01:35:19.647 --> 01:35:20.214
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT'S THE

01:35:20.281 --> 01:35:21.816
GOAL. SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN JUST

01:35:21.882 --> 01:35:22.683
ENSURE IT'S BEING ACHIEVED.

01:35:22.750 --> 01:35:24.185
OKAY, VICE CHAIR. YES, SENATOR.

01:35:24.251 --> 01:35:26.620
THANK YOU. I REALLY LIKE THIS. I

01:35:26.687 --> 01:35:28.656
WANT TO FIRST MAKE A COMMENT TO

01:35:28.722 --> 01:35:31.158
THE TO THE MEMBERS THAT GOING

01:35:31.225 --> 01:35:36.197
FROM 50 PARTS PER BILLION TO TEN

01:35:36.263 --> 01:35:38.699
PARTS PER BILLION IS

01:35:38.766 --> 01:35:42.236
EXTRAORDINARILY EXPENSIVE. AND

01:35:42.303 --> 01:35:44.305
ALSO ESPECIALLY FROM NATURALLY

01:35:44.371 --> 01:35:46.841
OCCURRING SOURCES SUCH AS WELLS

01:35:46.907 --> 01:35:48.142
AND THE ROCKS AND THE MINERALS.

01:35:48.209 --> 01:35:51.245
BUT I'D ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT,

01:35:51.312 --> 01:35:52.713
YOU KNOW, A LOT OF THIS YEARS

01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:55.116
AGO WAS GENERATED BY CHROME

01:35:55.182 --> 01:35:57.651
PLATING AND FROM POLY, YOU KNOW,

01:35:57.718 --> 01:36:00.821
FROM PCBS IN, IN TRANSFORMER

01:36:00.888 --> 01:36:02.456
FLUIDS. AND THERE WERE A LOT OF

01:36:02.523 --> 01:36:04.225
LOTS OF CHROMIUM SIX, BUT A LOT

01:36:04.291 --> 01:36:06.293
OF THAT'S GONE AWAY. SO IT'S

01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:08.129
WE'RE BACK TO NATURAL SOURCES.

01:36:08.195 --> 01:36:11.866
SO I GUESS MY QUESTION TO THE

01:36:11.932 --> 01:36:14.001
GENTLEMAN FROM LOS BANOS, I'D

01:36:14.068 --> 01:36:17.138
LIKE TO KNOW. YOU'RE TREATING TO

01:36:17.204 --> 01:36:20.307
50 PPB NOW, CORRECT? YES. AND SO

01:36:20.374 --> 01:36:22.810
THEN THEN YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO

01:36:22.877 --> 01:36:27.114
TEN PPB. AND WHAT WHAT DOES THAT

01:36:27.181 --> 01:36:28.215
COST? AGAIN, THE EARLY ESTIMATES

01:36:28.282 --> 01:36:30.784
ABOUT $65 MILLION. BUT THERE'S

01:36:30.851 --> 01:36:33.687
STILL A LOT OF QUESTIONS ON HOW

01:36:33.754 --> 01:36:35.456
WE GET TO THAT POINT. YOU KNOW,

01:36:35.523 --> 01:36:37.324
THROUGH THE WATER BOARD BEING AT

01:36:37.391 --> 01:36:39.793
APPROVED AND EVERYTHING. BUT OUR

01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:41.896
WELLS IN THE WINTERTIME ARE

01:36:41.962 --> 01:36:44.698
AROUND 15 TO 20 PARTS PER

01:36:44.765 --> 01:36:45.399
BILLION. AND THE SUMMERTIME,

01:36:45.466 --> 01:36:47.301
THEY GO UP A LITTLE BIT, MAYBE

01:36:47.368 --> 01:36:49.870
ANOTHER TEN. SO WE HAVE BEEN IN

01:36:49.937 --> 01:36:52.306
COMPLIANCE SINCE DAY ONE WITH

01:36:52.373 --> 01:36:55.943
FEDERAL AND THE EARLIER STATES

01:36:56.010 --> 01:36:57.478
LIMITS. BUT NOW WITH THIS NEW

01:36:57.545 --> 01:36:59.180
ONE, EVERY WELLS OUT OF

01:36:59.246 --> 01:37:02.483
COMPLIANCE. IS THAT AN AVERAGE?

01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:03.350
WERE YOU TALKING ABOUT AN

01:37:03.417 --> 01:37:05.553
AVERAGE IF YOU'RE 60. YEAH. IT'S

01:37:05.619 --> 01:37:07.087
TAKEN OVER TIME OKAY. IT'S AN

01:37:07.154 --> 01:37:10.090
AVERAGE. AND THEN MAY I ASK THE

01:37:10.157 --> 01:37:11.392
TECHNOLOGY ARE USING RESIN. ARE

01:37:11.458 --> 01:37:14.528
YOU USING WHAT. IT'S LIKE A SAND

01:37:14.595 --> 01:37:17.064
FILTER. AND BUT IT ONLY TAKES

01:37:17.131 --> 01:37:20.434
OUT, AS MY UNDERSTANDING IS

01:37:20.501 --> 01:37:22.536
ARSENIC AND CHROMIUM SIX. OKAY.

01:37:22.603 --> 01:37:24.171
SO IT'S NOT REALLY GOING TO MAKE

01:37:24.238 --> 01:37:25.573
OUR WATER THAT MUCH BETTER. AND

01:37:25.639 --> 01:37:28.042
TOTAL TOTAL SOLIDS DISSOLVED

01:37:28.108 --> 01:37:29.577
SOLIDS. BUT IT WILL TAKE THOSE

01:37:29.643 --> 01:37:31.879
TWO THINGS OUT. I APPRECIATE YOU

01:37:31.946 --> 01:37:33.814
AND SENATOR. GOOD JOB. THANK

01:37:33.881 --> 01:37:35.549
YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

01:37:35.616 --> 01:37:38.352
ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR

01:37:38.419 --> 01:37:42.022
DISCUSSION OKAY. APPRECIATE IT

01:37:42.089 --> 01:37:43.290
SENATOR. SO IT SOUNDS LIKE AND

01:37:43.357 --> 01:37:45.626
I'M ALSO ON JUDICIARY AS WELL.

01:37:45.693 --> 01:37:49.129
SO WE'LL HAVE SOME ONGOING

01:37:49.196 --> 01:37:50.331
DISCUSSIONS. APPRECIATE YOU

01:37:50.397 --> 01:37:53.234
BEING OPEN TO THAT. THIS DOES

01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:55.803
HAVE AN AI RECOMMENDATION TODAY

01:37:55.869 --> 01:37:57.504
FROM THE CHAIR. WOULD YOU LIKE

01:37:57.571 --> 01:38:00.307
TO CLOSE. YES. IN REGARDS TO THE

01:38:00.374 --> 01:38:02.109
CONVERSATION ON MAYBE CHANGING

01:38:02.176 --> 01:38:06.547
THE METHODOLOGY FROM FOR

01:38:06.614 --> 01:38:08.616
ACHIEVING THE SAME GOAL? YES. I

01:38:08.682 --> 01:38:09.416
WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF WE COULD

01:38:09.483 --> 01:38:11.285
HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH THE CHAIR

01:38:11.352 --> 01:38:13.420
OF JUDICIARY ABOUT THAT, SO THAT

01:38:13.487 --> 01:38:16.190
WE'RE PREPARED TO LOOK AT THAT

01:38:16.257 --> 01:38:18.125
WHEN IT GETS TO THAT COMMITTEE,

01:38:18.192 --> 01:38:19.627
WHICH IS, I THINK, LIKE NEXT

01:38:19.693 --> 01:38:21.328
WEEK OR THE WEEK AFTER SOMETHING

01:38:21.395 --> 01:38:23.430
VERY, VERY QUICK. BUT I REALLY

01:38:23.497 --> 01:38:25.566
APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION.

01:38:25.633 --> 01:38:27.534
AGAIN, WE'RE NOT TRYING TO SAY

01:38:27.601 --> 01:38:29.303
THEY DON'T WANT TO COMPLY. WE'RE

01:38:29.370 --> 01:38:32.740
NOT ASKING THAT THE PARTS PER

01:38:32.806 --> 01:38:36.076
BILLION REDUCTION CHANGE IN ANY

01:38:36.143 --> 01:38:38.245
WAY. WE'RE THE WATER AGENCIES

01:38:38.312 --> 01:38:42.149
ARE ALL ARE ALL GOING TO COMPLY.

01:38:42.216 --> 01:38:43.550
THEY JUST NEED TIME. AND THEY

01:38:43.617 --> 01:38:45.719
NEED AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE

01:38:45.786 --> 01:38:49.023
TO BE FREE FROM LITIGATION THAT

01:38:49.089 --> 01:38:51.225
IS BASED JUST BASED ON THE FACT

01:38:51.292 --> 01:38:52.626
THAT THEY'RE NOT IMMEDIATELY IN

01:38:52.693 --> 01:38:54.628
COMPLIANCE AS OPPOSED TO PUBLIC

01:38:54.695 --> 01:38:56.997
SAFETY DURING THE INTERIM. AND I
