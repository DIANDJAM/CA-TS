BECKER FOR HER HELP ON IMPROVING

00:47:26.276 --> 00:47:28.478
THIS BILL. THIS WOULD REQUIRE

00:47:28.545 --> 00:47:31.248
ANY ELECTION FOR A COUNTY BOARD

00:47:31.315 --> 00:47:32.282
OF EDUCATION BE CONSOLIDATED

00:47:32.349 --> 00:47:34.284
WITH THE STATEWIDE GENERAL

00:47:34.351 --> 00:47:36.186
ELECTION. THE REASON FOR THIS IS

00:47:36.253 --> 00:47:38.822
THAT, AS WE'RE ALL EXPERTS ON

00:47:38.889 --> 00:47:41.024
ELECTIONS, AND WE KNOW THAT THE

00:47:41.091 --> 00:47:43.927
GENERAL ELECTION TURNOUT IS

00:47:43.994 --> 00:47:45.329
SIGNIFICANTLY, SOMETIMES BY A

00:47:45.395 --> 00:47:47.331
FACTOR OF THREE, HIGHER THAN THE

00:47:47.397 --> 00:47:48.865
PRIMARY TURNOUT. THE COUNTY

00:47:48.932 --> 00:47:50.267
BOARD OF EDUCATION ON THE

00:47:50.334 --> 00:47:51.468
COUNTIES THAT DO ELECT THEIR

00:47:51.535 --> 00:47:53.737
BOARD IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT.

00:47:53.804 --> 00:47:56.173
AND SO IN ORDER TO ENFRANCHISE

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:58.542
AND TO INCLUDE AS MANY PEOPLE AS

00:47:58.609 --> 00:48:01.278
IS PRACTICAL, THIS BILL MOVES

00:48:01.345 --> 00:48:04.014
THAT ELECTION FROM THE PRIMARY

00:48:04.081 --> 00:48:05.182
TO THE GENERAL. ONE OF THE

00:48:05.249 --> 00:48:06.984
UNIQUE FEATURES OF THE ELECTION

00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:07.918
FOR COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION

00:48:07.985 --> 00:48:09.820
IS, IS THAT IT BASICALLY IS A

00:48:09.886 --> 00:48:11.355
PLURALITY ELECTION. SO IF YOU

00:48:11.421 --> 00:48:13.023
GET PLURALITY IN THE PRIMARY,

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:15.492
YOU COULD BE ELECTED WITH A VERY

00:48:15.559 --> 00:48:17.794
SMALL NUMBER OF VOTES AND HAVE A

00:48:17.861 --> 00:48:19.997
VERY SIGNIFICANT JOB. SO THAT'S

00:48:20.063 --> 00:48:22.099
THE PURPOSE OF THE OF THE BILL.

00:48:22.165 --> 00:48:23.967
WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY IS

00:48:24.034 --> 00:48:26.069

00:48:31.275 --> 00:48:32.109
MORNING, CHAIR, AND MEMBERS OF

SAVANNAH JORGENSEN, AND I'M HERE

00:48:34.811 --> 00:48:36.813
ON BEHALF OF THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:38.181
VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA TO EXPRESS

00:48:38.248 --> 00:48:40.717
OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR SB 249.

00:48:40.784 --> 00:48:42.352
THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THAT

00:48:42.419 --> 00:48:43.320
ELECTIONS FOR COUNTY BOARDS OF

00:48:43.387 --> 00:48:44.788
EDUCATION BE CONSOLIDATED WITH

00:48:44.855 --> 00:48:46.323
THE STATEWIDE GENERAL ELECTION,

00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:48.025
A SIMPLE BUT POWERFUL CHANGE

00:48:48.091 --> 00:48:50.560
THAT STRENGTHENS OUR DEMOCRACY.

00:48:50.627 --> 00:48:51.928
VOTER TURNOUT IN PRIMARY

00:48:51.995 --> 00:48:53.330
ELECTIONS IS TYPICALLY LOWER AND

00:48:53.397 --> 00:48:55.165
LESS DIVERSE THAN IN GENERAL

00:48:55.232 --> 00:48:57.367
ELECTIONS. THAT MEANS A SMALL,

00:48:57.434 --> 00:48:58.435
UNREPRESENTATIVE SLICE OF THE

00:48:58.502 --> 00:48:59.936
ELECTORATE CAN END UP MAKING

00:49:00.003 --> 00:49:01.338
MAJOR DECISIONS ABOUT PUBLIC

00:49:01.405 --> 00:49:03.073
EDUCATION, DECISIONS THAT IMPACT

00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:05.242
EVERY FAMILY AND STUDENT IN OUR

00:49:05.309 --> 00:49:07.210
COMMUNITIES. ACCORDING TO RECENT

00:49:07.277 --> 00:49:08.845
VOTER PARTICIPATION STATISTICS

00:49:08.912 --> 00:49:10.781
FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S

00:49:10.847 --> 00:49:12.516
OFFICE, TURNOUT IN THE 2024

00:49:12.582 --> 00:49:14.651
PRIMARY WAS 35% OF REGISTERED

00:49:14.718 --> 00:49:16.620
VOTERS, COMPARED WITH 71% DURING

00:49:16.687 --> 00:49:19.690
THE 2024 GENERAL ELECTION. AND

00:49:19.756 --> 00:49:21.058
STUDIES SHOW THAT THE PRIMARY

00:49:21.124 --> 00:49:22.159
ELECTORATE TENDS TO

00:49:22.225 --> 00:49:22.893
DISPROPORTIONATELY EXCLUDE

00:49:22.959 --> 00:49:25.095
YOUNGER VOTERS. LATINOS, ASIAN

00:49:25.162 --> 00:49:28.365
AMERICANS, AND BLACK VOTERS. BY

OF EDUCATION CONTEST WITH THE

00:49:30.534 --> 00:49:32.836
GENERAL ELECTION, SB 249 ENSURES

00:49:32.903 --> 00:49:34.738
THAT MORE CALIFORNIANS,

00:49:34.805 --> 00:49:35.906
ESPECIALLY THOSE FROM

00:49:35.972 --> 00:49:37.107
UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES,

00:49:37.174 --> 00:49:39.142
HAVE A MEANINGFUL VOICE IN

00:49:39.209 --> 00:49:39.843
CHOOSING THE LEADERS WHO SHAPE

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:42.045
OUR LOCAL EDUCATION SYSTEMS.

00:49:42.112 --> 00:49:43.246
THIS ALIGNS WITH THE LEAGUE'S

00:49:43.313 --> 00:49:44.414
BELIEF THAT LOCAL GOVERNANCE

00:49:44.481 --> 00:49:46.016
SHOULD REFLECT THE VOICE OF THE

GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS TIM

00:51:12.969 --> 00:51:14.738
SHAW. I SERVE AS A TRUSTEE ON

00:51:14.805 --> 00:51:15.939
THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF

00:51:16.006 --> 00:51:17.274
EDUCATION. THIS IS THE THIRD

00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:19.543
TIME IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS

00:51:19.609 --> 00:51:20.010
WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING

00:51:20.076 --> 00:51:21.044
LEGISLATION THAT WOULD MOVE THE

00:51:21.111 --> 00:51:22.746
ELECTIONS FOR OUR BOARD. ONLY

00:51:22.813 --> 00:51:23.847
THIS TIME WOULD CHANGE THE

00:51:23.914 --> 00:51:25.515
ELECTIONS FOR FIVE COUNTY BOARDS

00:51:25.582 --> 00:51:27.350
OF EDUCATION. GOVERNOR NEWSOM

00:51:27.417 --> 00:51:29.686
PREVIOUSLY VETOED THIS IDEA LAST

00:51:29.753 --> 00:51:32.189
YEAR IN THE FORM OF SB 907,

00:51:32.255 --> 00:51:33.123
CITING COSTS AND THE NEED TO

00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:34.925
RESPECT LOCAL CONTROL. AND THAT

00:51:34.991 --> 00:51:36.760
WAS WHEN IT WAS ONLY AFFECTING

00:51:36.827 --> 00:51:38.662
THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF

00:51:38.728 --> 00:51:40.397
EDUCATION. SB 249 WILL OBVIOUSLY

00:51:40.464 --> 00:51:42.232
HAVE HIGHER COSTS AND MORE

00:51:42.299 --> 00:51:44.301
BLATANTLY STRIP AWAY LOCAL

00:51:44.367 --> 00:51:46.303
CONTROL. OUR BOARD VOTED

00:51:46.369 --> 00:51:48.004
UNANIMOUSLY TO OPPOSE THIS BILL

00:51:48.071 --> 00:51:50.540
BECAUSE IT IS UNNECESSARY.

00:51:50.607 --> 00:51:51.908
RESPECTFULLY, WE DO NOT BELIEVE

00:51:51.975 --> 00:51:52.876
SENATORS AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS

00:51:52.943 --> 00:51:55.011
FROM AROUND THE STATE NEED TO

00:51:55.078 --> 00:51:56.947
DECIDE WHEN WE HOLD OUR

00:51:57.013 --> 00:51:58.048
ELECTIONS. THIS IS CERTAINLY A

00:51:58.114 --> 00:51:58.882
MATTER THAT CAN BE LEFT FOR

00:51:58.949 --> 00:52:01.284
LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO DECIDE. A

00:52:01.351 --> 00:52:02.486
VALID ARGUMENT EXISTS FOR BOTH

00:52:02.552 --> 00:52:03.987
THE GENERAL ELECTION OR THE

00:52:04.054 --> 00:52:05.755
PRIMARY ELECTION. TURNOUT DOES

00:52:05.822 --> 00:52:07.691
TEND TO BE HIGHER IN NOVEMBER,

00:52:07.757 --> 00:52:09.459
SO IT CAN BE ARGUED THAT RESULTS

00:52:09.526 --> 00:52:11.328
ARE MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE

00:52:11.394 --> 00:52:12.863
DISTRICT. IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT

00:52:12.929 --> 00:52:14.264
THE NOVEMBER BALLOT TENDS TO BE

00:52:14.331 --> 00:52:16.466
MUCH LONGER, GIVING THE VOTERS

00:52:16.533 --> 00:52:17.634
MANY MORE CONTESTS TO WADE

00:52:17.701 --> 00:52:20.136
THROUGH. THE PROBLEM OF BALLOT

00:52:20.203 --> 00:52:21.805
FATIGUE IS WELL DOCUMENTED IN

00:52:21.872 --> 00:52:23.173
OUR COUNTY. WE HOLD THE ELECTION

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:25.008
IN THE PRIMARY, ALLOWING THE

00:52:25.075 --> 00:52:26.743
VOTERS TO MAKE THE CONTEST FOR

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:27.777
COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION A

00:52:27.844 --> 00:52:29.646
CONTEST OF HIGH IMPORTANCE, NOT

00:52:29.713 --> 00:52:31.548
A CONTEST BURIED BENEATH PAGES

00:52:31.615 --> 00:52:33.517
OF OTHER RACES. WE BELIEVE THAT

00:52:33.583 --> 00:52:35.785
ELEVATES THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE

00:52:35.852 --> 00:52:37.687
OFFICES, OUR NEIGHBORING COUNTY

00:52:37.754 --> 00:52:39.222
TO THE NORTH. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD

00:52:39.289 --> 00:52:42.192
OF LOS ANGELES, DOES NOT HOLD

00:52:42.259 --> 00:52:43.560
ELECTIONS WHATSOEVER FOR THEIR

00:52:43.627 --> 00:52:46.263
COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION'S. IF

00:52:46.329 --> 00:52:47.764
THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE

00:52:47.831 --> 00:52:49.432
ARE INTERESTED IN BRINGING A

00:52:49.499 --> 00:52:50.934
BETTER DEMOCRATIC REPRESENTATION

00:52:51.001 --> 00:52:53.103
TO A COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION,

00:52:53.169 --> 00:52:53.904
OBVIOUSLY LOS ANGELES COUNTY

00:52:53.970 --> 00:52:55.739
WOULD BE THE PLACE TO START

00:52:55.805 --> 00:52:57.741
WHERE THEY ARE APPOINTED AND NOT

00:52:57.807 --> 00:53:00.343
ELECTED AT ALL. SO WE ASK THAT

00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:01.778
THE LEGISLATURE RESPECT LOCAL

00:53:01.845 --> 00:53:04.214
DECISION MAKING AND REJECT SB

00:53:04.281 --> 00:53:07.083
249. THANK YOU. AND YOU HAVE TWO

00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:08.852
MINUTES AS WELL. GOOD MORNING.

00:53:08.919 --> 00:53:10.453
MARY BACH, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:11.821
ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF

00:53:11.888 --> 00:53:13.189
EDUCATION. I'M ALSO HERE TO

00:53:13.256 --> 00:53:14.624
EXPRESS MY CONCERN REGARDING THE

00:53:14.691 --> 00:53:16.393
CONTINUED EFFORTS BY OUR STATE

00:53:16.459 --> 00:53:17.928
LEGISLATURE TO REALLOCATE

00:53:17.994 --> 00:53:19.362
TAXPAYER FUNDS TOWARDS SHIFTING

00:53:19.429 --> 00:53:20.697
OUR ELECTIONS FROM THE PRIMARY

00:53:20.764 --> 00:53:22.299
TO THE GENERAL ELECTION, GIVING

00:53:22.365 --> 00:53:23.600
THE PRESSING ISSUES OUR STATE

00:53:23.667 --> 00:53:25.135
CURRENTLY FACES SUCH AS RISING

00:53:25.201 --> 00:53:27.270
CRIME RATES, HOMELESSNESS,

00:53:27.337 --> 00:53:28.738
ONGOING FIRE RECOVERY EFFORTS,

00:53:28.805 --> 00:53:30.674
ESCALATING GAS PRICES. IT IS

00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:31.908
DISHEARTENING TO WITNESS THIS

00:53:31.975 --> 00:53:33.443
MAN REPEATEDLY PRIORITIZE. THIS

00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:35.579
IS ALSO MY THIRD TIME GOING

00:53:35.645 --> 00:53:37.180
THROUGH THIS. MOVING OUR

00:53:37.247 --> 00:53:38.081
ELECTIONS TO THE GENERAL

00:53:38.148 --> 00:53:39.549
ELECTION CREATES CONFUSION AS

00:53:39.616 --> 00:53:41.318
WELL AS VOTER FATIGUE. THE

00:53:41.384 --> 00:53:42.285
PRIMARY ELECTION PROVIDES AN

00:53:42.352 --> 00:53:44.187
IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY FOR US AS

00:53:44.254 --> 00:53:46.723
BOARD MEMBERS OR CANDIDATES TO

00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:47.524
DISTINGUISH THE ROLE OF THE

00:53:47.591 --> 00:53:48.959
COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION FROM

00:53:49.025 --> 00:53:50.293
THE LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS IN THE

00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:52.095
CITIES WE REPRESENT. WE ALL

00:53:52.162 --> 00:53:53.363
REPRESENT SEVERAL CITIES, AND IN

00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:55.865
EACH OF THOSE CITIES, THEY HAVE

00:53:55.932 --> 00:53:58.301
AS MANY AS 2 TO 4 BOARD MEMBERS

00:53:58.368 --> 00:53:59.736
RUNNING. AND SO BY LUMPING US

00:53:59.803 --> 00:54:02.505
IN, IT'S CREATE QUITE A BIT OF

00:54:02.572 --> 00:54:03.406
CONFUSION FOR THEM. THIS

00:54:03.473 --> 00:54:04.708
DISTINCTION IS VITAL, ESPECIALLY

00:54:04.774 --> 00:54:05.976
SINCE EACH OF THOSE CITIES

00:54:06.042 --> 00:54:08.645
ALREADY HAS SO MANY OTHER

00:54:08.712 --> 00:54:10.080
CANDIDATES ON THEIR BALLOT IN

00:54:10.146 --> 00:54:11.715
NOVEMBER. CONSIDERING THE

00:54:11.781 --> 00:54:12.983
STATE'S CURRENT BUDGET CONCERNS,

00:54:13.049 --> 00:54:14.417
I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE THAT

00:54:14.484 --> 00:54:16.886
ASSEMBLY BILL 249 SHOULD BE A

00:54:16.953 --> 00:54:18.488
LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY.

00:54:18.555 --> 00:54:19.856
FURTHERMORE, I'M PUZZLED AS TO

00:54:19.923 --> 00:54:21.157
WHY THIS BILL IS BEING

00:54:21.224 --> 00:54:21.992
RECONSIDERED, ESPECIALLY AFTER

00:54:22.058 --> 00:54:23.760
THE GOVERNOR VETOED IT LAST

00:54:23.827 --> 00:54:25.161
YEAR, CITING THE IMPORTANCE OF

00:54:25.228 --> 00:54:26.997
LOCAL CONTROL, AMONG OTHER

00:54:27.063 --> 00:54:28.131
ISSUES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME

00:54:28.198 --> 00:54:30.400
THIS MORNING AND CONSIDERATION

00:54:30.467 --> 00:54:31.368
OF THIS IMPORTANT MATTER. THANK

00:54:31.434 --> 00:54:32.869
YOU SO MUCH. WE'LL NOW MOVE ON

00:54:32.936 --> 00:54:34.204
TO ANY OTHER ADDITIONAL

00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:36.272
WITNESSES IN THE ROOM TO COME UP

00:54:36.339 --> 00:54:37.841
TO THE MIC, STATE YOUR NAME,

00:54:37.907 --> 00:54:40.610
ORGANIZATION AND YOUR POSITION.

00:54:40.677 --> 00:54:42.012
GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS GREG

00:54:42.078 --> 00:54:43.013
ROWLAND. I'M GENERAL COUNSEL OF

THE ORANGE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF

EDUCATION, AND WE'RE IN

00:54:47.617 --> 00:54:50.754
OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. HI,

KNOW ELECTIONS ARE OPEN TO ALL

00:54:58.895 --> 00:55:00.930
THOSE, NOT JUST THOSE THAT HAVE

00:55:00.997 --> 00:55:02.332
MORE PIGMENT IN THEIR SKIN. WE

00:55:02.399 --> 00:55:04.100
ARE IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. I

00:55:04.167 --> 00:55:06.603
UNDERSTAND THAT ANY OTHER

00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:09.472
WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION? SEEING

00:55:09.539 --> 00:55:11.408
NONE, WE'LL NOW MOVE IT TO THE

00:55:11.474 --> 00:55:12.742
COMMITTEE. ANY QUESTIONS OR

00:55:12.809 --> 00:55:15.979
COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS?

00:55:16.046 --> 00:55:18.081

THE DISAGREEMENT THAT WE HAVE

00:55:21.518 --> 00:55:24.721
HERE, BUT I WILL MOVE THE BILL.

00:55:24.788 --> 00:55:27.123
DO WE HAVE A MOTION? DO WE HAVE

00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:28.625
A SECOND? WE HAVE A SECOND. ANY

00:55:28.692 --> 00:55:30.660

RESPECTFUL DISAGREEMENT. I DO

00:55:36.566 --> 00:55:38.068
THINK THIS IS A MATTER OF

00:55:38.134 --> 00:55:39.102
STATEWIDE INTEREST, NOT JUST

00:55:39.169 --> 00:55:40.737
ORANGE COUNTY INTERESTS, THAT WE

00:55:40.804 --> 00:55:42.305
ENLARGE THE ELECTORATE THAT

00:55:42.372 --> 00:55:45.542
CHOOSES THIS VERY IMPORTANT,

00:55:45.608 --> 00:55:46.176
THESE VERY IMPORTANT POSITIONS.

00:55:46.242 --> 00:55:47.777
AND WITH THAT, I URGE AND I

00:55:47.844 --> 00:55:51.715
VOTE. AND WE HAVE A TELEPHONE

00:55:51.781 --> 00:55:54.884
CALL. OKAY, OKAY. SO, YOU KNOW,

00:55:54.951 --> 00:55:56.352
ELECTIONS FOR COUNTY BOARDS OF

00:55:56.419 --> 00:55:57.420
EDUCATION GENERALLY ARE SINGLE

00:55:57.487 --> 00:55:58.822
ROUND ELECTIONS WITH NO CHANCE

00:55:58.888 --> 00:56:00.557
OF A RUNOFF ELECTION. THIS BILL

00:56:00.623 --> 00:56:02.425
WILL ENSURE THESE ELECTIONS ARE

00:56:02.492 --> 00:56:03.827
HELD AT A STATEWIDE GENERAL

00:56:03.893 --> 00:56:05.662
ELECTION, WHERE VOTER TURNOUT IS

00:56:05.729 --> 00:56:07.397
HIGHER AND MORE REPRESENTATIVE

00:56:07.464 --> 00:56:08.398
OF THE JURISDICTION'S

00:56:08.465 --> 00:56:09.733
ELECTORATE. WHILE I APPRECIATE

00:56:09.799 --> 00:56:11.868
THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL

00:56:11.935 --> 00:56:13.236
FOR INCREASING VOTER FATIGUE BY

00:56:13.303 --> 00:56:14.571
ADDING TO THE LENGTH OF THE

00:56:14.637 --> 00:56:16.473
NOVEMBER BALLOT, THIS CONTEST

00:56:16.539 --> 00:56:17.874
BEING A SCHOOL CONTEST ACTUALLY

00:56:17.941 --> 00:56:19.642
APPEARS DIRECTLY AFTER THE STATE

00:56:19.709 --> 00:56:20.810
CONTEST, SO IT'S PRETTY MUCH

00:56:20.877 --> 00:56:22.612
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

00:58:12.655 --> 00:58:15.091
MISTER TRENT L®NG. THANK YOU,

00:58:15.158 --> 00:58:16.326
MADAM CHAIR. YOU HAVE TWO

00:58:16.392 --> 00:58:18.228
MINUTES. THANK YOU. GOOD

00:58:18.294 --> 00:58:19.529
MORNING, MADAM CHAIR AND

00:58:19.596 --> 00:58:20.430
MEMBERS. I'M TRENT LANG,

00:58:20.496 --> 00:58:21.364
PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA

00:58:21.431 --> 00:58:22.699
CLEAN MONEY CAMPAIGN. WE'RE

00:58:22.765 --> 00:58:25.435
PROUD TO SUPPORT SB 398 AND ARE

00:58:25.501 --> 00:58:26.469
GRATEFUL TO THE LEADERSHIP OF

00:58:26.536 --> 00:58:28.404
SENATOR UMBERG FOR AUTHORING

00:58:28.471 --> 00:58:30.340

00:58:30.406 --> 00:58:31.674
WORK OF THIS COMMITTEE TO

00:58:31.741 --> 00:58:33.476
IMPROVE IT. ONE OF THE

00:58:33.543 --> 00:58:35.011
CORNERSTONES OF OUR DEMOCRACY IS

00:58:35.078 --> 00:58:36.446
THAT PRINCIPLE THAT NO ONE

00:58:36.512 --> 00:58:39.048
SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO BUY VOTES.

00:58:39.115 --> 00:58:41.017
THAT'S WHY FEDERAL LAW PROHIBITS

00:58:41.084 --> 00:58:42.952
OFFERING PAYMENTS IN EXCHANGE

00:58:43.019 --> 00:58:45.021
FOR REGISTERING TO VOTE OR TO

00:58:45.088 --> 00:58:47.223
VOTE. HOWEVER, IT DOES NOT

00:58:47.290 --> 00:58:49.559
EXPLICITLY BAN THE USE OF

00:58:49.626 --> 00:58:51.160
LOTTERIES, NOR DOES IT

00:58:51.227 --> 00:58:53.696
EXPLICITLY BAN GIVING INCENTIVES

00:58:53.763 --> 00:58:55.398

00:58:57.300 --> 00:58:58.668
LOOPHOLE HAS RECENTLY BEEN

00:58:58.735 --> 00:59:00.536
EXPLOITED, AS SENATOR UMBERG

00:59:00.603 --> 00:59:01.604

ANOTHER PETITION. THESE WERE

00:59:25.728 --> 00:59:26.896
TRANSPARENT ATTEMPTS TO

00:59:26.963 --> 00:59:28.264
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO REGISTER WHO

00:59:28.331 --> 00:59:29.966
WEREN'T ALREADY REGISTERED, EVEN

00:59:30.033 --> 00:59:31.134
IF IT WASN'T ACTUALLY STATED ON

THE ENTRY INTO THE LOTTERY.

00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:38.508
THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT

00:59:38.574 --> 00:59:40.810
THAT SB 398, AS SENATOR UMBERG

00:59:40.877 --> 00:59:42.078
DESCRIBES, MAKES IT A CRIME TO

00:59:42.145 --> 00:59:44.147
GIVE CRIME TO GIVE MONEY OR

00:59:44.213 --> 00:59:45.381

00:59:48.718 --> 00:59:50.219
WHETHER THE PERSON VOTED OR

REGISTERED TO VOTE. THE

00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:54.090
COMMITTEE HAS MADE VERY

00:59:54.157 --> 00:59:56.359
APPROPRIATE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR

00:59:56.426 --> 00:59:58.494
EXCLUSIONS FOR THINGS SUCH AS

GOVERNMENT, AND PAID TIME OFF

01:00:02.465 --> 01:00:04.200
FOR EMPLOYEES WITH THESE. WITH

01:00:04.267 --> 01:00:05.969
THESE AMENDMENTS, SB 398 WILL

01:00:06.035 --> 01:00:07.937
STILL DO WHAT IT MUST. IT WILL

01:00:08.004 --> 01:00:10.373
CLOSE THIS LOOPHOLE AND MAKE

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:11.774
SURE THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN IN

01:00:11.841 --> 01:00:12.909
CALIFORNIA. SO WE RESPECTFULLY

IT'S JUST HARD TO IMAGINE THAT

01:01:28.217 --> 01:01:30.453

01:01:52.275 --> 01:01:54.343
MUCH. BUYING OF VOTES HAS

01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:56.879
HISTORIC PRECEDENT. AND IT'S A

01:01:56.946 --> 01:01:58.481
VERY POWERFUL INCENTIVE TO VOTE

01:01:58.548 --> 01:02:01.951
OR TO REGISTER TO VOTE. IT'S MY

01:02:02.018 --> 01:02:03.519
VIEW, AND I THINK THE VIEW OF

01:02:03.586 --> 01:02:05.555
CLEAN MONEY AND COMMON CAUSE,

01:02:05.621 --> 01:02:06.589
ETC, THAT, YOU KNOW, ONE SHOULD

01:02:06.656 --> 01:02:08.091
REGISTER TO VOTE NOT BECAUSE

01:02:08.157 --> 01:02:09.025
THEY'RE PAID TO REGISTER TO

01:02:09.092 --> 01:02:10.359
VOTE. ONE SHOULD VOTE NOT

01:02:10.426 --> 01:02:11.094
BECAUSE THEY'RE PAID TO VOTE,

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:13.629
BUT BECAUSE IT'S THEIR PATRIOTIC

01:02:13.696 --> 01:02:14.063
RESPONSIBILITY. BUT

01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:15.364
NEVERTHELESS, THAT IS A POWERFUL

01:02:15.431 --> 01:02:16.632
INCENTIVE. AND ONE QUICK LITTLE

01:02:16.699 --> 01:02:18.134
ANECDOTE. THIS IS FROM OVER 30

01:02:18.201 --> 01:02:19.569
YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS WALKING

01:02:19.635 --> 01:02:20.670
PRECINCTS, FIRST ELECTION, I

01:02:20.736 --> 01:02:22.872
EVER WALKED PRECINCTS WITH MY

01:02:22.939 --> 01:02:24.674
FOUR YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AT THE

01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:26.109
TIME, AND WE WERE HANDING OUT

01:02:26.175 --> 01:02:28.277
SMALL LITTLE PLANTS AND HAD A

01:02:28.344 --> 01:02:30.046
LITTLE VOTE FOR X FOR MAYOR ON

01:02:30.113 --> 01:02:31.214
THE PLANT. AND MY DAUGHTER SAID,

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:34.117
WHY, YOU KNOW, WHY ARE WE

01:02:34.183 --> 01:02:34.750
HANDING OUT THESE PLANTS? AND I

01:02:34.817 --> 01:02:35.785
SAID, IT'S A SYMBOL. IT'S A

01:02:35.852 --> 01:02:37.920
SYMBOL OF THE CANDIDATE. PEOPLE

01:02:37.987 --> 01:02:38.688
WILL KEEP IT. THEY'LL BE

01:02:38.754 --> 01:02:40.156
REMINDED THAT THIS CANDIDATE IS

01:02:40.223 --> 01:02:40.790
ENVIRONMENTALIST, AND THEY WANT

01:02:40.857 --> 01:02:41.924
TO BASICALLY PROVIDE FOR OPEN

01:02:41.991 --> 01:02:43.292
SPACE AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS,

01:02:43.359 --> 01:02:45.928
AND IT'S GOT THAT PERSON'S NAME

01:02:45.995 --> 01:02:46.896
ON IT. SO THEY'LL KEEP IT. AND

01:02:46.963 --> 01:02:48.731
WE HOPE TO ELECTION. AND SHE

01:02:48.798 --> 01:02:50.066
SAID, WELL, WHY DON'T WE JUST

01:02:50.133 --> 01:02:52.602
GIVE THEM MONEY. WHICH, WHICH I

01:02:52.668 --> 01:02:54.103
THOUGHT, YEAH, THAT'S THAT

01:02:54.170 --> 01:02:56.239
ILLUSTRATES MY POINT IS EVEN A

01:02:56.305 --> 01:02:58.441
FOUR YEAR OLD RECOGNIZES THE

01:02:58.508 --> 01:03:01.644
INCENTIVE TO VOTE WHEN ONE GETS

01:03:01.711 --> 01:03:03.146
MONEY. SO WITH THAT I URGE AND I

01:03:03.212 --> 01:03:06.482
VOTE. GREAT STORY. YES. AND I

01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:07.049
REMEMBER THE POTHOLDERS TOO.

01:03:07.116 --> 01:03:10.319
THOSE WERE GREAT. SO I AGREE

01:03:10.386 --> 01:03:11.287
WITH THE AUTHOR AND SUPPORTERS

01:03:11.354 --> 01:03:13.122
THAT THE TACTICS USED IN SWING

01:03:13.189 --> 01:03:15.224
STATES DURING THE NOVEMBER 2024

01:03:15.291 --> 01:03:16.726
ELECTION AND SUBSEQUENTLY IN

01:03:16.792 --> 01:03:18.661
WISCONSIN WERE VERY TROUBLING,

01:03:18.728 --> 01:03:20.396
AND I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S

01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:21.864
GOAL TO TRY AND PREVENT THESE

01:03:21.931 --> 01:03:22.865
SORTS OF ACTIVITIES FROM

01:03:22.932 --> 01:03:25.368
OCCURRING IN CALIFORNIA. I DO,

01:03:25.434 --> 01:03:26.836
HOWEVER, BELIEVE THAT THE BROAD

01:03:26.903 --> 01:03:28.271
NATURE OF THE PROHIBITION THIS

01:03:28.337 --> 01:03:30.106
BILL COULD HAVE THOSE UNINTENDED

01:03:30.173 --> 01:03:31.073
CONSEQUENCES. SO I APPRECIATE

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:32.208
THE AUTHOR'S WILLINGNESS TO

01:03:32.275 --> 01:03:34.010
ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED

01:03:34.076 --> 01:03:35.945
IN THE COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS. AND

01:03:36.012 --> 01:03:37.747
WITH THOSE AMENDMENTS, I'M

01:03:37.813 --> 01:03:38.981
RECOMMENDING SUPPORT. WE HAVE A

01:03:39.048 --> 01:03:41.584
MOTION BY A SECOND BY BENNET, I

01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:43.886
BELIEVE. WAS IT I HAVE IT

01:03:43.953 --> 01:03:45.288
BACKWARD. THAT'S RIGHT. OKAY.

01:03:45.354 --> 01:03:49.892
AND YOU MAY CALL THE ROLL ON SB

01:03:49.959 --> 01:03:51.594
398 BY UMBERG. THE MOTION IS TO

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:53.462
PASS AS AMENDED AND BE REFERRED

01:03:53.529 --> 01:03:56.065
TO THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC

01:03:56.132 --> 01:03:58.067
SAFETY. PELLERIN I, PELLERIN I

01:03:58.134 --> 01:04:02.538
MACEDO. MACEDO I BENNETT.

01:04:02.605 --> 01:04:05.208
BENNETT I BERMAN. BERMAN, I,

01:04:05.274 --> 01:04:11.147
SELASSIE I STEFANI. ZERO. THAT

01:04:11.214 --> 01:04:12.448
BILL IS OUT FIVE ZERO. WE'LL

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:14.684
KEEP THE ROLL OPEN FOR ABSENT

01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:16.619
MEMBER. AND YOU HAVE YOUR THIRD.

01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:18.120
YOU'RE DOING A HAT TRICK TODAY.

01:04:18.187 --> 01:04:19.422
WE GOT A THIRD MEASURE. ITEM

01:04:19.488 --> 01:04:22.692
ONE, SB 42. THANK YOU. YEAH,

01:04:22.758 --> 01:04:25.194
RIGHT. IF I HAVE HIT MY QUOTA.

01:04:25.261 --> 01:04:27.730
WELL, I APPRECIATE I APPRECIATE

01:04:27.797 --> 01:04:30.366
YOU EXPANDING THE OPPORTUNITY

01:04:30.433 --> 01:04:32.034
HERE FOR THE UMBRAGE SHOW TODAY.

01:04:32.101 --> 01:04:35.371
SO SB 42 SB 42 IS AN INCREDIBLY

01:04:35.438 --> 01:04:36.906
IMPORTANT BILL. AND WHAT THIS

01:04:36.973 --> 01:04:39.308
BILL DOES IS IT REMOVES THE BAN

01:04:39.375 --> 01:04:41.244
ON PUBLIC FINANCING FOR GENERAL

01:04:41.310 --> 01:04:43.212
LAW CITIES AND COUNTIES.

01:04:43.279 --> 01:04:44.347
CURRENTLY, WE HAVE THIS

01:04:44.413 --> 01:04:46.415
DICHOTOMY IN CALIFORNIA WHERE IF

01:04:46.482 --> 01:04:48.317
YOU'RE A CHARTER CITY AND OR

01:04:48.384 --> 01:04:51.220
COUNTY, YOU CAN PROVIDE FOR SOME

01:04:51.287 --> 01:04:52.922
FORM OF PUBLIC FINANCING.

01:04:52.989 --> 01:04:54.690
THERE'S NO DICTATED FORM.

01:04:54.757 --> 01:04:56.225
THERE'S NO MANDATORY FORM OF

01:04:56.292 --> 01:04:57.660
PUBLIC FINANCING. THERE ARE MANY

01:04:57.727 --> 01:04:59.195
DIFFERENT MODALITIES ALL AROUND

01:04:59.262 --> 01:05:00.830
THE COUNTRY, EVEN ALL AROUND

01:05:00.896 --> 01:05:02.331
CALIFORNIA. BUT CURRENTLY CITIES

01:05:02.398 --> 01:05:03.766
AND COUNTIES ARE BANNED IF

01:05:03.833 --> 01:05:05.167
THEY'RE GENERAL LAW CITIES AND

01:05:05.234 --> 01:05:06.369
COUNTIES. THIS SIMPLY REMOVES

01:05:06.435 --> 01:05:10.339
THE BAN. IT ALLOWS FOLKS TO

01:05:10.406 --> 01:05:11.774
EXPERIMENT. NOW THIS JUST PUTS

01:05:11.841 --> 01:05:15.378
IT ON THE BALLOT. SO TO BE CLEAR

01:05:15.444 --> 01:05:17.446
THIS IS A MULTI STEP PROCESS

01:05:17.513 --> 01:05:20.349
BEFORE THERE IS ANY MODALITY OF

01:05:20.416 --> 01:05:21.851
PUBLIC FINANCING. SO FIRST IT

01:05:21.917 --> 01:05:23.319
HAS TO GET THROUGH THE

01:05:23.386 --> 01:05:24.820
LEGISLATURE. THEN SECOND HAS TO

01:05:24.887 --> 01:05:26.789
GO ON THE BALLOT. AND THEN THE

01:05:26.856 --> 01:05:28.591
VOTERS BY A MAJORITY VOTE HAVE

01:05:28.658 --> 01:05:30.893
TO APPROVE IT. AND THEN FOR

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.728
EXAMPLE, A CITY THAT WISHES TO

01:05:32.795 --> 01:05:35.031
ENACT SOME PUBLIC FINANCING

01:05:35.097 --> 01:05:37.233
MECHANISM EITHER HAS TO TAKE IT

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:38.734
TO THE PEOPLE OR, IF THE CITY

01:05:38.801 --> 01:05:40.736
PERMITS IT, THE CITY COUNCIL CAN

01:05:40.803 --> 01:05:43.939
CAN AFFECT IT. THIS TO ME, IT

01:05:44.006 --> 01:05:46.509
MAKES SENSE. AGAIN, THERE'S

01:05:46.575 --> 01:05:49.011
MISINFORMATION AS TO WHAT MAY BE

01:05:49.078 --> 01:05:50.646
REQUIRED. THERE IS NOTHING

01:05:50.713 --> 01:05:51.514
REQUIRED IN THIS BILL.

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:53.115
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. IT SIMPLY

01:05:53.182 --> 01:05:55.251
REMOVES THE BAN THAT CURRENTLY

01:05:55.318 --> 01:05:57.653
EXISTS TODAY AND ALLOWS GENERAL

01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:00.356
LAW CITIES AND COUNTIES TO ENACT

01:06:00.423 --> 01:06:01.691
THEIR OWN LEGISLATION. AND WITH

01:06:01.757 --> 01:06:03.426
THAT, I HAVE TWO WITNESSES. I

01:06:03.492 --> 01:06:05.094
HAVE, AGAIN, MR. TRENT L®NG,

01:06:05.161 --> 01:06:06.762
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FROM CLEAN

01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:08.264
MONEY CALIFORNIA AND DAVID SHAW

01:06:08.331 --> 01:06:09.665
FROM CALIFORNIA. COMMON CAUSE.

01:06:09.732 --> 01:06:11.033
THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR.

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:12.368
WONDERFUL. AND YOU EACH HAVE TWO

01:06:12.435 --> 01:06:14.036
MINUTES. THANK YOU AGAIN. GOOD

01:06:14.103 --> 01:06:15.438
MORNING AGAIN, MADAM CHAIR.

01:06:15.504 --> 01:06:16.472
MEMBERS. TRENT L®NG AGAIN

01:06:16.539 --> 01:06:17.440
PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:06:17.506 --> 01:06:19.308
CLEAN MONEY CAMPAIGN. WE'RE VERY

01:06:19.375 --> 01:06:20.376
PROUD TO SPONSOR SB 42, ALONG

01:06:20.443 --> 01:06:22.178
WITH OUR CO-SPONSORS, CALIFORNIA

01:06:22.244 --> 01:06:23.579
COMMON CAUSE AND THE WOMEN

01:06:23.646 --> 01:06:25.481
VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA, AND ARE

01:06:25.548 --> 01:06:26.515
VERY GRATEFUL TO THE LEADERSHIP

01:06:26.582 --> 01:06:29.051
OF SENATOR UMBERG ALLEN AND

01:06:29.118 --> 01:06:30.953
CERVANTES AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEE

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:32.722
FOR AUTHORING IT AND FOR THE

01:06:32.788 --> 01:06:34.390
WORK OF THIS COMMITTEE. AGAIN,

01:06:34.457 --> 01:06:37.793
IT'S PATENTLY UNFAIR THAT

01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:39.261
CALIFORNIA JURISDICTIONS OTHER

01:06:39.328 --> 01:06:40.529
THAN CHARTER CITIES AREN'T

01:06:40.596 --> 01:06:42.398
ALLOWED THE SAME OPTION TO HAVE

01:06:42.465 --> 01:06:44.266
PUBLIC FINANCING OF CAMPAIGNS

01:06:44.333 --> 01:06:47.036
THAT CHARTER CITIES HAVE. I DO

01:06:47.103 --> 01:06:49.105
WANT TO ADDRESS CONCERNS THAT

01:06:49.171 --> 01:06:50.339
HAVE BEEN RAISED IN SOME PLACES

01:06:50.406 --> 01:06:51.807
THAT GOVERNMENTS MIGHT

01:06:51.874 --> 01:06:53.275
ARBITRARILY BE ABLE TO

01:06:53.342 --> 01:06:55.444
ARBITRARILY PROHIBIT CERTAIN

01:06:55.511 --> 01:06:58.948
CANDIDATES FROM ACCESSING PUBLIC

01:06:59.014 --> 01:07:01.450
FINANCING. THE BILL ACTUALLY

01:07:01.517 --> 01:07:02.651
EXPLICITLY PROTECTS AGAINST THIS

01:07:02.718 --> 01:07:04.453
BY SAYING PUBLIC FUNDING

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:05.921
STATUTES, CHARTERS, ORDINANCES,

01:07:05.988 --> 01:07:08.290
AND RESOLUTIONS SHALL NOT

01:07:08.357 --> 01:07:10.126
DISCRIMINATE BASED ON PARTY OR

01:07:10.192 --> 01:07:11.961
ACCORDING TO WHETHER A CANDIDATE

01:07:12.027 --> 01:07:13.129
IS A CHALLENGER INCUMBENT. SO IT

01:07:13.195 --> 01:07:14.964
HAS THAT BASIC PROTECTION IN

01:07:15.030 --> 01:07:16.198
THERE. A CONCERNS HAVE ALSO BEEN

01:07:16.265 --> 01:07:17.633
RAISED ABOUT PRESSURE ON

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:20.703
JURISDICTIONS, BUDGETS, PUBLIC

01:07:20.770 --> 01:07:21.937
FINANCE CAMPAIGNS GENERALLY HAVE

01:07:22.004 --> 01:07:24.240
ACTUALLY VERY LOW PRICE TAGS IN

01:07:24.306 --> 01:07:25.841
THE CHARTER CITIES THAT WE'VE

01:07:25.908 --> 01:07:29.178
SEEN. TYPICALLY IT'S BETWEEN

01:07:29.245 --> 01:07:32.381
0.0.0 2% AND 0.07% OF THE

01:07:32.448 --> 01:07:33.916
BUDGET. IS THE IS THE OVERALL

01:07:33.983 --> 01:07:37.052
COST FOR IT A VERY SMALL PRICE

01:07:37.119 --> 01:07:39.188
TO PAY TO ENSURE THAT VOTERS

01:07:39.255 --> 01:07:40.756
HAVE LESS PERCEPTION OF

01:07:40.823 --> 01:07:42.091
INFLUENCE BY SPECIAL INTERESTS,

01:07:42.158 --> 01:07:43.259
WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS

01:07:43.325 --> 01:07:44.527
INFLUENCE OR NOT. WE WANT TO

01:07:44.593 --> 01:07:46.829
REDUCE THE PERCEPTION OF THAT.

01:07:46.896 --> 01:07:48.531
AND AS SENATOR SCHUMER POINTED

01:07:48.597 --> 01:07:50.399
OUT, SB 42 DOES NOT ACTUALLY

01:07:50.466 --> 01:07:53.369
IMPLEMENT ANY SYSTEM AT ALL. IT

01:07:53.436 --> 01:07:55.504
JUST GIVES JURISDICTIONS THEIR

01:07:55.571 --> 01:07:58.974
OWN CONTROL TO IMPLEMENT PUBLIC

01:07:59.041 --> 01:08:00.943
FINANCING IF THEY WANT TO, HOW

01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:02.411
MUCH THEY IF THEY WANT TO AT

01:08:02.478 --> 01:08:03.979
ALL, HOW MUCH THEY WANT TO

01:08:04.046 --> 01:08:05.147
PROVIDE, WHAT SORT OF SYSTEM

01:08:05.214 --> 01:08:07.650
THEY WANT TO USE, ETC. AND

01:08:07.716 --> 01:08:09.151
LASTLY, THE MEASURE SB 42 WILL

01:08:09.218 --> 01:08:11.353
PUT ON THE BALLOT DOES PROVIDE

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:12.588
BASIC PROTECTIONS BY REQUIRING

01:08:12.655 --> 01:08:14.890
THAT VOLUNTARILY PARTICIPATING

01:08:14.957 --> 01:08:16.725
CANDIDATES MUST ABIDE BY

01:08:16.792 --> 01:08:17.660
EXPENDITURE LIMITS AND MEET

01:08:17.726 --> 01:08:19.495
STRICT CRITERIA TO QUALIFY WITH

01:08:19.562 --> 01:08:21.297
SOME VERY BASIC OUTLINES OF

01:08:21.363 --> 01:08:22.898
THAT. WE THEREFORE RESPECTFULLY

01:08:22.965 --> 01:08:25.000
REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE TO GIVE

01:08:25.067 --> 01:08:26.669
VOTERS THE OPTION TO DECIDE.

01:08:26.735 --> 01:08:28.304
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. YOU HAVE

01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:31.207
TWO MINUTES. MEMBERS OF THE

01:08:31.273 --> 01:08:32.942
COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR HAVING

01:08:33.008 --> 01:08:34.777
ME. MY NAME IS DAVID SHAW. CAN

01:08:34.844 --> 01:08:36.579
YOU HEAR ME? YES. AND I AM HERE

01:08:36.645 --> 01:08:38.280
ON BEHALF OF COMMON CAUSE AND A

01:08:38.347 --> 01:08:39.582
BROAD COALITION OF DEMOCRACY,

01:08:39.648 --> 01:08:41.317
COMMUNITY AND GRASSROOTS

01:08:41.383 --> 01:08:43.819
ORGANIZATIONS SUPPORTING SB 42,

01:08:43.886 --> 01:08:45.187
COMMON CAUSE IS PROUD TO

01:08:45.254 --> 01:08:46.956
CO-SPONSOR SB 42 BECAUSE WE

01:08:47.022 --> 01:08:48.791
BELIEVE IN A MORE INCLUSIVE

01:08:48.858 --> 01:08:49.892
DEMOCRACY WHERE EVERYDAY PEOPLE,

01:08:49.959 --> 01:08:51.427
NOT JUST THE WEALTHY, HAVE A

01:08:51.494 --> 01:08:53.395
REAL VOICE IN ELECTIONS. COMMON

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:54.597
CAUSE HAS LONG SUPPORTED THIS

01:08:54.663 --> 01:08:55.931
TYPE OF REFORM, AND OUR

01:08:55.998 --> 01:08:57.466
COALITION HAS TWO. OUR

01:08:57.533 --> 01:08:58.901
CO-SPONSOR, THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN

01:08:58.968 --> 01:09:00.302
VOTERS, HAS BEEN WORKING ON

01:09:00.369 --> 01:09:02.404
MAKING A DEMOCRACY THAT WORKS

01:09:02.471 --> 01:09:02.972
FOR ALL OF US FOR OVER A

01:09:03.038 --> 01:09:04.573
CENTURY. BUT TODAY, THAT

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.942
PRINCIPLE IS UNDER ATTACK. SB 42

01:09:07.009 --> 01:09:08.210
WOULD PLACE A BALLOT MEASURE ON

01:09:08.277 --> 01:09:10.679
THE 2020 BALLOT TO END THE STATE

01:09:10.746 --> 01:09:12.214
BAN ON PUBLIC FINANCING AND HELP

01:09:12.281 --> 01:09:13.682
BUILD A POLITICAL SYSTEM THAT

01:09:13.749 --> 01:09:14.450
WORKS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. IT

01:09:14.517 --> 01:09:15.784
TOOK CALIFORNIA'S VOTERS OF

01:09:15.851 --> 01:09:17.586
TODAY, OR IT ALLOWS CALIFORNIA'S

01:09:17.653 --> 01:09:19.188
VOTERS OF TODAY TO DECIDE HOW WE

01:09:19.255 --> 01:09:21.223
WANT THE CALIFORNIA OF TOMORROW

01:09:21.290 --> 01:09:22.291
TO LOOK. WE URGE THIS COMMITTEE

01:09:22.358 --> 01:09:24.059
TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND PLACE

01:09:24.126 --> 01:09:25.160
THE CALIFORNIA FAIR ELECTIONS

01:09:25.227 --> 01:09:26.829
ACT BEFORE THE VOTERS ON THE

01:09:26.896 --> 01:09:29.064
NOVEMBER 2020 BALLOT. ACROSS

01:09:29.131 --> 01:09:30.566
CALIFORNIA, PEOPLE FEEL SHUT OUT

01:09:30.633 --> 01:09:32.568
OF THE POLITICAL PROCESS. MANY

01:09:32.635 --> 01:09:34.436
BELIEVE ONLY THE WEALTHY OR

01:09:34.503 --> 01:09:35.104
THOSE WITH WELL-CONNECTED DONORS

01:09:35.170 --> 01:09:36.972
CAN COMPETE, DISCOURAGING

01:09:37.039 --> 01:09:38.340
PARTICIPATION IN OUR DEMOCRACY.

01:09:38.407 --> 01:09:40.576
DATA SHOWS THIS CONCERN IS REAL.

01:09:40.643 --> 01:09:42.678
IN OAKLAND, HALF OF CAMPAIGN

01:19:23.792 --> 01:19:29.131
HAVE TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU. MY

01:19:29.197 --> 01:19:31.533
NAME IS DAVID. SOME OF THE

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.068
THINGS THAT WERE MENTIONED, BUT

01:19:33.135 --> 01:19:34.736
NOT REALLY MENTIONED IS ABOUT

01:19:34.803 --> 01:19:36.271
WHAT ADDS ON TO THIS BILL. I

01:19:36.338 --> 01:19:38.173
KNOW IT SAID THAT IT'S JUST TO

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:40.275
PUT IT ON THE BALLOT, BUT WHAT

01:19:40.342 --> 01:19:41.009
IT DOES DO, IT DOES NOT ALLOW

01:19:41.076 --> 01:19:43.145
ANY LOAN REPAYMENT FROM MATCHING

01:19:43.211 --> 01:19:44.146
FUNDS. NOW, WE ALL KNOW

01:19:44.212 --> 01:19:45.780
CALIFORNIA IS A BLUE STATE. WE

01:19:45.847 --> 01:19:47.349
HAVE A SUPERMAJORITY IN THIS

01:19:47.415 --> 01:19:49.151
LEGISLATURE. 75% OF YOU ARE

01:19:49.217 --> 01:19:52.120
DEMOCRATS. I CANNOT SEE HOW THIS

01:19:52.187 --> 01:19:54.156
BILL IS NOT AN ATTACK ON THE

01:19:54.222 --> 01:19:56.024
OPPOSITION, BECAUSE MANY OF THE

01:19:56.091 --> 01:19:57.359
MANY OF THE CANDIDATES THAT RUN,

01:19:57.425 --> 01:19:59.194
I KNOW, ESPECIALLY IN MY

01:19:59.261 --> 01:20:00.328
DISTRICT, IN THE 40TH ASSEMBLY

01:20:00.395 --> 01:20:02.564
DISTRICT AND THE 27TH ASSEMBLY

01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:04.132
DISTRICT, THE CAMPAIGNS THAT RAN

01:20:04.199 --> 01:20:05.567
AGAINST THE INCUMBENTS ARE STILL

01:20:05.634 --> 01:20:06.835
SITTING RIGHT NOW. THEY GOT

01:20:06.902 --> 01:20:08.470
THEIR ELECTION STARTED WITH

01:20:08.537 --> 01:20:10.872
LOANS TO THEMSELVES. NOW,

01:20:10.939 --> 01:20:12.541
FORGIVE ME FOR NOT KNOWING THE

01:20:12.607 --> 01:20:14.342
ELECTION CODE THAT WELL, BECAUSE

01:20:14.409 --> 01:20:16.144
I DO WORK A 72 HOUR JOB AND

01:20:16.211 --> 01:20:18.046
EVERYTHING I DO UP HERE IS

01:20:18.113 --> 01:20:21.082
VOLUNTARILY ON MY ON MY OWN

01:20:21.149 --> 01:20:22.150
TIME. SO I DON'T KNOW IF THIS

01:20:22.217 --> 01:20:23.685
APPLIES TO ACTUALLY ASSEMBLY AND

01:20:23.752 --> 01:20:27.789
SENATE RACES, BUT IT ALSO LIMITS

01:20:27.856 --> 01:20:29.524
THE AMOUNT OF MATCHING FUNDS TO,

01:20:29.591 --> 01:20:30.892
IF I'M UNDERSTANDING IT. RIGHT.

01:20:30.959 --> 01:20:32.961
BECAUSE IT WAS WRITTEN IN A WAY

01:20:33.028 --> 01:20:34.696
TO ME THAT WAS OBFUSCATING. SO

01:20:34.763 --> 01:20:36.064
FORGIVE ME IF I'M WRONG, BUT IT

01:20:36.131 --> 01:20:37.332
LOOKS LIKE IT ONLY ALLOWS

01:20:37.399 --> 01:20:38.333
MATCHING FUNDS UP TO $10, SO

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:41.336
EACH PERSON HAS TO GIVE $10, AND

01:20:41.403 --> 01:20:43.605
IT MAY ALSO ALLOW THE LOCALITY

01:20:43.672 --> 01:20:45.006
TO SAY, WELL, IF YOU GAVE $100,

01:20:45.073 --> 01:20:46.241
WE'LL GIVE YOU A $10 TOWARDS

01:20:46.308 --> 01:20:47.809
THAT, TOWARDS MATCHING FUNDS.

01:20:47.876 --> 01:20:49.711
THERE IS SO MUCH POLITICAL POWER

01:20:49.778 --> 01:20:52.547
IN THIS ROOM IN THIS STATE. THE

01:20:52.614 --> 01:20:54.649
BACKERS OF THIS BILL ARE BIG

01:20:54.716 --> 01:20:56.218
POWERHOUSES THE AFL-CIO, THE

01:20:56.284 --> 01:20:57.919
NURSES UNION, ALL THESE

01:20:57.986 --> 01:20:59.487
WITNESSES THAT ARE DEMOCRATS

01:20:59.554 --> 01:21:00.789
FROM DEMOCRATIC, DIFFERENT

01:21:00.855 --> 01:21:02.924
DEMOCRATIC CLUBS. IT LOOKS LIKE

01:21:02.991 --> 01:21:06.561
DEMOCRATICALLY FUNDED. YEAH. I

01:21:06.628 --> 01:21:08.363
CAN'T SEE THIS AS ATTACK OF

01:21:08.430 --> 01:21:10.599
THAT. AND ALSO ANOTHER THING

01:21:10.665 --> 01:21:13.001
THAT IT DOES, IT INCREASES THE

01:21:13.068 --> 01:21:14.836
FINE. IF THERE'S MONEY THAT WAS

01:21:14.903 --> 01:21:16.371
GIVEN THAT WAS NOT ALLOWED, IT'S

01:21:16.438 --> 01:21:19.374
NOW IT'S $1 TO $1 UP TO THREE

01:21:19.441 --> 01:21:21.710
TIMES. SO WITH THAT I SAID MY

01:21:21.776 --> 01:21:22.978
PIECE. I WOULD ASK FOR A NO

01:21:23.044 --> 01:21:25.313
VOTE, BUT I ONLY KNOW TWO OF YOU

01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:27.315
ARE GOING TO VOTE NO. SO THANK

01:21:27.382 --> 01:21:29.050
YOU FOR LISTENING. THANK YOU SO

01:21:29.117 --> 01:21:30.085
MUCH. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN

01:21:30.151 --> 01:21:32.187
THE ROOM WHO WOULD LIKE TO ADD

01:21:32.254 --> 01:21:33.989
ON AS A ME TO IN OPPOSITION TO

01:21:34.055 --> 01:21:35.890
THIS BILL? SEEING NONE, I'LL

01:21:35.957 --> 01:21:37.125
BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE.

01:21:37.192 --> 01:21:38.760
ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN THANK

01:21:38.827 --> 01:21:40.161
YOU. CHAIR POWELL. I WANT TO

01:21:40.228 --> 01:21:41.296
THANK SENATOR UMBERG FOR

01:21:41.363 --> 01:21:42.364
BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD EVERY

01:21:42.430 --> 01:21:44.266
SO OFTEN. THIS IS MY NINTH YEAR

01:21:44.332 --> 01:21:45.734
IN THE ASSEMBLY. AND, YOU KNOW,

01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:47.335
EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS A BILL

01:21:47.402 --> 01:21:48.370
GETS INTRODUCED AND I THINK,

01:21:48.436 --> 01:21:49.938
DANG, I WISH I INTRODUCED THAT

01:21:50.005 --> 01:21:52.407
BILL MYSELF. AND THIS IS

01:21:52.474 --> 01:21:53.775
ABSOLUTELY ONE OF THOSE. AND I

01:21:53.842 --> 01:21:55.543
APPRECIATE YOU ADDING ME ON AS A

01:21:55.610 --> 01:21:56.911
PRINCIPAL COAUTHOR TO, YOU KNOW,

01:21:56.978 --> 01:21:58.880
SHOW MY STRONG SUPPORT FOR THIS

01:21:58.947 --> 01:22:00.815
EFFORT. I KNOW THERE ARE A BUNCH

01:22:00.882 --> 01:22:02.684
OF FOLKS FROM PALO ALTO WHO ARE

01:22:02.751 --> 01:22:03.985
HERE TODAY. I GOT MY START IN

01:22:04.052 --> 01:22:05.654
PUBLIC SERVICE IN PALO ALTO BACK

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:07.055
IN 2012, RUNNING FOR THE CITY

01:22:07.122 --> 01:22:09.257
COUNCIL. AND BACK THEN WE HAD

01:22:09.324 --> 01:22:11.326
SORT OF INFORMAL AGREEMENT THAT

01:22:11.393 --> 01:22:13.161
YOU WOULDN'T RAISE MONEY IN MORE

01:22:13.228 --> 01:22:15.196
THAN $500 CONTRIBUTIONS, AND YOU

01:22:15.263 --> 01:22:17.032
WOULDN'T SPEND MORE THAN $35,000

01:22:17.098 --> 01:22:18.366
TOTAL ON YOUR CAMPAIGN. THAT WAS

01:22:18.433 --> 01:22:20.168
INFORMAL. IT WASN'T A RULE, BUT

01:22:20.235 --> 01:22:21.436
PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY STUCK BY

01:22:21.503 --> 01:22:23.438
IT. AND THEN FOUR YEARS LATER,

01:22:23.505 --> 01:22:25.640
WHEN I WAS RUNNING FOR THE STATE

01:22:25.707 --> 01:22:26.975
ASSEMBLY, SIX VERY WEALTHY

01:22:27.042 --> 01:22:29.778
FAMILIES IN PALO ALTO EACH SPENT

01:22:29.844 --> 01:22:31.946
$20,000 PER FAMILY TO TRY TO

01:22:32.013 --> 01:22:33.014
INFLUENCE THE CITY COUNCIL

01:22:33.081 --> 01:22:34.282
ELECTIONS IN PALO ALTO. I MEAN,

01:22:34.349 --> 01:22:36.651
THERE'S JUST BEEN SUCH AN

01:22:36.718 --> 01:22:39.120
EXPLOSION IN MONEY IN CAMPAIGNS

01:22:39.187 --> 01:22:40.989
AT THE VERY LOCAL LEVEL, ALL THE

01:22:41.056 --> 01:22:42.857
WAY UP TO THE STATE AND THE

01:22:42.924 --> 01:22:44.859
FEDERAL LEVEL. AND THIS WON'T

01:22:44.926 --> 01:22:46.695
RESTRICT ANYBODY'S ABILITY TO DO

01:22:46.761 --> 01:22:48.463
THAT. BUT IT GIVES CITIES THE

01:22:48.530 --> 01:22:49.798
CHANCE TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT

01:22:49.864 --> 01:22:52.133
THEY WANT TO CREATE A SYSTEM, TO

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:55.337
ALLOW FOR AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:22:55.403 --> 01:22:56.371
MORE GRASSROOTS CANDIDATES TO

01:22:56.438 --> 01:22:58.306
REALLY KIND OF CATCH FIRE AND

01:22:58.373 --> 01:22:59.941
GET THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED

01:23:00.008 --> 01:23:01.409
TO RUN CREDIBLE CAMPAIGNS. AND I

01:23:01.476 --> 01:23:02.911
THINK THAT THAT'S A REALLY

01:23:02.977 --> 01:23:03.878
INTERESTING KIND OF POLICY

01:23:03.945 --> 01:23:05.347
SPACE. I KNOW THIS ISN'T

01:23:05.413 --> 01:23:06.681
PRESCRIPTIVE. IT DOESN'T SAY

01:23:06.748 --> 01:23:08.950
EXACTLY, YOU KNOW, WHAT THE

01:23:09.017 --> 01:23:10.185
PROGRAMS HAVE TO LOOK LIKE. IT

01:23:10.251 --> 01:23:11.920
LEAVES IT UP TO IT, LEAVES IT UP

01:23:11.986 --> 01:23:13.588
TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:15.190
DECIDE WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. BUT

01:23:15.256 --> 01:23:17.325
I THINK THIS IS AN AREA THAT WE

01:23:17.392 --> 01:23:18.960
ALL SHOULD FOCUS MORE ON TO

01:23:19.027 --> 01:23:19.794
RESEARCH WHAT OTHER

01:23:19.861 --> 01:23:20.862
JURISDICTIONS ARE DOING IN OTHER

01:23:20.929 --> 01:23:22.530
PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND ADOPT

01:23:22.597 --> 01:23:24.432
BEST PRACTICES IN CALIFORNIA,

01:23:24.499 --> 01:23:28.069
BECAUSE I THINK THE EXPLOSION OF

01:23:28.136 --> 01:23:30.105
MONEY IN POLITICS HAS REALLY

01:23:30.171 --> 01:23:33.174
MADE IT HARDER FOR, YOU KNOW,

01:23:33.241 --> 01:23:34.142
CANDIDATES WHO AREN'T

01:23:34.209 --> 01:23:35.276
NECESSARILY A PART OF THE

01:23:35.343 --> 01:23:36.678
ESTABLISHMENT OR CANDIDATES WHO

01:23:36.745 --> 01:23:39.180
WHO DON'T HAVE A LOT OF PERSONAL

01:23:39.247 --> 01:23:41.716
WEALTH TO RUN CREDIBLE

01:23:41.783 --> 01:23:43.351
COMPETITIVE CAMPAIGNS AND, AND

01:23:43.418 --> 01:23:45.086
BE SUCCESSFUL. AND THIS LEVELS

01:23:45.153 --> 01:23:46.454
THAT PLAYING FIELD A LITTLE BIT

01:23:46.521 --> 01:23:47.922
OR GIVES THE POTENTIAL TO LEVEL

01:23:47.989 --> 01:23:49.290
THAT PLAYING FIELD A LITTLE BIT.

01:23:49.357 --> 01:23:52.193
AND IT IS TRUE IT WAS MENTIONED

01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:52.927
BY BY AN OPPOSITION WITNESS

01:23:52.994 --> 01:23:54.396
THAT, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A THREE

01:23:54.462 --> 01:23:55.930
QUARTERS MAJORITY OF DEMOCRATS

01:23:55.997 --> 01:23:57.232
IN THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE.

01:23:57.298 --> 01:23:59.334
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WE

01:23:59.401 --> 01:24:01.069
HAVE THAT BASED ON ONE OF THE

01:24:01.136 --> 01:24:02.937
FAIREST ELECTION SYSTEMS IN THE

01:24:03.004 --> 01:24:04.072
COUNTRY, RIGHT. UNLIKE STATES

01:24:04.139 --> 01:24:06.608
LIKE TEXAS AND FLORIDA THAT HAVE

01:24:06.674 --> 01:24:07.776
RAMPANT GERRYMANDERING, WHERE,

01:24:07.842 --> 01:24:09.177
YOU KNOW, THE WINNER AND LOSER

01:24:09.244 --> 01:24:10.879
OF THE RACE BEFORE THE ELECTION

01:24:10.945 --> 01:24:12.647
EVER HAPPENS. IN CALIFORNIA, WE

01:24:12.714 --> 01:24:13.782
HAVE AN INDEPENDENT

01:24:13.848 --> 01:24:15.350
REDISTRICTING COMMISSION WHERE

01:24:15.417 --> 01:24:16.918
REPUBLICANS HAVE AS MUCH SAY AS

01:24:16.985 --> 01:24:19.220
DEMOCRATS DO. AND WE HAVE A TOP

01:24:19.287 --> 01:24:21.289
TWO PRIMARY SYSTEM THAT LEADS TO

01:24:21.356 --> 01:24:22.624
SOME OF THE MOST COMPETITIVE

01:24:22.690 --> 01:24:23.925
RACES IN THE COUNTRY AND GIVES

01:24:23.992 --> 01:24:25.760
THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ANY

01:24:25.827 --> 01:24:26.461
CANDIDATE, REPUBLICAN OR

01:24:26.528 --> 01:24:29.264
DEMOCRAT, TO CHANCE TO HAVE A

01:24:29.330 --> 01:24:30.632
REAL SAY AS OPPOSED TO THE

01:24:30.698 --> 01:24:33.868
POLITICIANS. PICKING AND

01:24:33.935 --> 01:24:35.270
CHOOSING THE WINNERS BY DRAWING

01:24:35.336 --> 01:24:36.471
THE DISTRICTS AND THE BOUNDARIES

01:24:36.538 --> 01:24:38.306
THAT THEY WANT. SO, YOU KNOW,

01:24:38.373 --> 01:24:40.742
THERE'S A THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY

01:24:40.809 --> 01:24:42.377
FOR MY, MY COLLEAGUES IN THE

01:24:42.444 --> 01:24:44.412
OTHER PARTY TO WIN RACES. I'D

01:24:44.479 --> 01:24:46.815
ARGUE THAT YOU GOT TO GET VOTERS

01:24:46.881 --> 01:24:48.716
TO VOTE FOR YOU. AND DEMOCRATS

01:24:48.783 --> 01:24:51.986
HAVE GOTTEN THREE QUARTERS OF

01:24:52.053 --> 01:24:53.421
DISTRICTS IN THE ASSEMBLY AND

01:24:53.488 --> 01:24:54.055
THREE QUARTERS OF DISTRICTS IN

01:24:54.122 --> 01:24:55.924
THE SENATE TO VOTE FOR

01:24:55.990 --> 01:24:57.659
DEMOCRATS. BUT IT'S A FAIR

01:24:57.725 --> 01:24:58.660
SYSTEM. EVERYBODY'S GOT A

01:24:58.726 --> 01:24:59.861
CHANCE. AND I THINK THIS BILL

01:24:59.928 --> 01:25:02.130
WILL MAKE IT A MORE FAIR SYSTEM.

01:25:02.197 --> 01:25:03.932
SO HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL

01:25:03.998 --> 01:25:08.870
TODAY. THANKS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

01:25:08.937 --> 01:25:10.805
YES, THANK YOU. I JUST HAVE A

01:25:10.872 --> 01:25:14.242
VERY JUST SIMPLE PLAIN-ENGLISH

01:25:14.309 --> 01:25:17.078
QUESTION. SO THIS BILL ALLOWS

01:25:17.145 --> 01:25:18.947
GIVES THE OPTION TO THE VOTER TO

01:25:19.013 --> 01:25:21.082
ALLOW TAXPAYER FUNDED DOLLARS TO

01:25:21.149 --> 01:25:24.652
FUND CAMPAIGNS. SO WHAT THIS

01:25:24.719 --> 01:25:26.788
BILL DOES IS IT PUTS IT ON THE

01:25:26.855 --> 01:25:29.057
BALLOT. AND IF THE MAJORITY OF

01:25:29.123 --> 01:25:31.292
CALIFORNIANS BELIEVE THAT CITIES

01:25:31.359 --> 01:25:32.527
SHOULD BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH

01:25:32.594 --> 01:25:34.462
THEIR OWN FORM OF PUBLIC

01:25:34.529 --> 01:25:36.231
FINANCING, THEY CAN DO SO.

01:25:36.297 --> 01:25:37.532
WHETHER IT'S TAXPAYER DOLLARS,

01:25:37.599 --> 01:25:39.334
WHETHER IT'S DONATIONS THAT ARE

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:40.535
MATCHED BY OTHER DONATIONS.

01:25:40.602 --> 01:25:41.936
THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF

01:25:42.003 --> 01:25:44.172
DIFFERENT MODALITIES TO HOW YOU

01:25:44.239 --> 01:25:46.307
MIGHT HAVE DIFFERENT FINANCING

01:25:46.374 --> 01:25:49.210
OPTIONS. SO 1988, IT WAS ON THE

01:25:49.277 --> 01:25:51.346
BALLOT IN 2010 IT WAS ON THE

01:25:51.412 --> 01:25:53.314
BALLOT. AND NOW IN THIS TIME

01:25:53.381 --> 01:25:55.216
WHERE I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:25:55.283 --> 01:25:58.186
FEEL THAT THERE'S FISCAL

01:25:58.253 --> 01:26:00.054
IRREGULARITIES, YOU KNOW, THE LA

01:26:00.121 --> 01:26:00.889
REPORTS THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

01:26:00.955 --> 01:26:03.224
DEFICITS ALL THE WAY UP UNTIL

01:26:03.291 --> 01:26:04.559
2028. THEY'VE ANSWERED QUESTIONS

01:26:04.626 --> 01:26:06.160
THAT WE COULDN'T EVEN VOTE ON

01:26:06.227 --> 01:26:07.362
THE SAME BUDGET THAT WE RECENTLY

01:26:07.428 --> 01:26:09.731
VOTED THIS WEEK IN THREE MONTHS,

01:26:09.797 --> 01:26:10.732
THREE YEARS, SIMPLY BECAUSE WE

01:26:10.798 --> 01:26:12.166
WON'T HAVE THE RAINY DAY FUND

01:26:12.233 --> 01:26:15.103
AVAILABLE TO US. WITH THE TOP

01:26:15.169 --> 01:26:17.138
TEN CITIES ALL BEING IN MASSIVE

01:26:17.205 --> 01:26:19.440
DEFICITS. DO YOU THINK THIS IS

01:26:19.507 --> 01:26:20.942
SOMETHING THAT IN THIS TIME,

01:26:21.009 --> 01:26:22.210
RIGHT NOW, VOTERS ARE GOING TO

01:26:22.277 --> 01:26:24.045
SAY THAT WE WOULD LIKE TAXPAYER

01:26:24.112 --> 01:26:25.880
FUNDED DOLLARS TO GO TOWARDS

01:26:25.947 --> 01:26:27.081
CAMPAIGNS? WE'RE GOING TO FIND

01:26:27.148 --> 01:26:28.016
OUT. I THINK WE'RE GOING TO FIND

01:26:28.082 --> 01:26:29.951
OUT, SHOULD WE BE SUCCESSFUL IN

01:26:30.018 --> 01:26:31.219
PUTTING ON THE BALLOT, THAT

01:26:31.286 --> 01:26:33.154
WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT WHETHER

01:26:33.221 --> 01:26:33.755
THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS

01:26:33.821 --> 01:26:36.391
WANT SUPPORT IT. AND THEN TWO,

01:26:36.457 --> 01:26:37.091
WE'RE GOING TO RETURN LOCAL

01:26:37.158 --> 01:26:39.928
CONTROL TO FINANCING CAMPAIGNS.

01:26:39.994 --> 01:26:42.196
SO IF THE CITY COUNCILS WITHIN

01:26:42.263 --> 01:26:43.531
YOUR DISTRICT ASSEMBLY MEMBER,

01:26:43.598 --> 01:26:45.366
THEY DON'T LIKE IT, OR THE

01:26:45.433 --> 01:26:46.467
VOTERS WITHIN THOSE CITIES DON'T

01:26:46.534 --> 01:26:47.936
LIKE IT, THEY DON'T HAVE TO

01:26:48.002 --> 01:26:49.704
ENACT IT. IT'S SIMPLY LOCAL

01:26:49.771 --> 01:26:51.105
CONTROL. WITH THE OVER 400

01:26:51.172 --> 01:26:52.774
CHARTER CITIES IN CALIFORNIA,

01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:55.577
HOW COME ONLY FIVE DO IT? WELL,

01:26:55.643 --> 01:26:57.579
I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON THOSE FIVE

01:26:57.645 --> 01:27:00.081
CITIES OR THE OTHER 300 SOME ODD

01:27:00.148 --> 01:27:03.051
CITIES. THAT'S ILLUSTRATIVE OF

01:27:03.117 --> 01:27:04.752
LOCAL CONTROL. IF A CITY DOESN'T

01:27:04.819 --> 01:27:06.821
WANT TO ENACT ANYTHING, THEY

01:27:06.888 --> 01:27:09.090
DON'T HAVE TO ENACT ANYTHING.

01:27:09.157 --> 01:27:11.960
OKAY. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:27:12.026 --> 01:27:15.897
BENNETT. THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR.

01:27:15.964 --> 01:27:20.034
YOU KNOW, OCCASIONALLY ROBIN OR

01:27:20.101 --> 01:27:23.938
ROBIN. UMBERG. ANOTHER SUPPORTER

01:27:24.005 --> 01:27:27.475
CALLING IN. THAT'S THAT'S

01:27:27.542 --> 01:27:31.279
PRESUMPTIVE. SO. OCCASIONALLY

01:27:31.346 --> 01:27:33.247
BIG MONEY IN POLITICS ACTUALLY

01:27:33.314 --> 01:27:36.818
BUYS LEGISLATION, BUT FAR MORE

01:27:36.884 --> 01:27:39.387
OFTEN BIG MONEY IN POLITICS IS

01:27:39.454 --> 01:27:41.889
BLOCKING LEGISLATION. AND WE SEE

01:27:41.956 --> 01:27:44.459
THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AND

01:27:44.525 --> 01:27:47.695
THAT'S WHY I'VE BEEN A STRONG

01:27:47.762 --> 01:27:49.464
SUPPORTER OF THIS. AND MR. L®NG

01:27:49.530 --> 01:27:51.532
CAME DOWN AND VISITED IN VENTURA

01:27:51.599 --> 01:27:53.368
COUNTY AS WE TRIED TO DO PUBLIC

01:27:53.434 --> 01:27:55.336
FINANCING IN VENTURA COUNTY 20

01:27:55.403 --> 01:27:58.673
YEARS AGO. SO I APPLAUD THE

01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:01.709
EFFORTS OF SENATOR FOR

01:28:01.776 --> 01:28:04.712
CONTINUING THIS EFFORT TO TRY TO

01:28:04.779 --> 01:28:05.580
ENABLE MORE PLACES TO HAVE

01:28:05.647 --> 01:28:07.181
PUBLIC FINANCING. BUT ONE OF THE

01:28:07.248 --> 01:28:08.716
THINGS I THINK IS IMPORTANT FOR

01:28:08.783 --> 01:28:10.551
US TO POINT OUT IS THAT IN THE

01:28:10.618 --> 01:28:12.353
PLACES THAT HAVE ENGAGED IN

01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:15.356
PUBLIC FINANCING, THEY HAVE HAD

01:28:15.423 --> 01:28:17.525
SIGNIFICANT BREAKTHROUGHS IN

01:28:17.592 --> 01:28:18.559
LEGISLATION THAT WAS BEING

01:28:18.626 --> 01:28:20.695
BLOCKED BY BIG MONEY. THAT WAS

01:28:20.762 --> 01:28:22.296
ALWAYS MAKING SURE THAT THE BIG

01:28:22.363 --> 01:28:24.332
MONEY CANDIDATE WAS WINNING. AND

01:28:24.399 --> 01:28:26.801
WHEN PUBLIC FINANCING CAME IN,

01:28:26.868 --> 01:28:29.404
SUDDENLY YOU HAD CANDIDATES THAT

01:28:29.470 --> 01:28:31.572
WERE ABLE TO BE COMPETITIVE

01:28:31.639 --> 01:28:34.776
ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO BREAK THAT

01:28:34.842 --> 01:28:38.146
LOGJAM. AND SO WE CAN'T MEASURE

01:28:38.212 --> 01:28:40.481
HOW MUCH DAMAGE IS BEING DONE IN

01:28:40.548 --> 01:28:43.384
AMERICA BY THE BLOCKING OF GOOD

01:28:43.451 --> 01:28:45.219
LEGISLATION FROM FROM BIG MONEY.

01:28:45.286 --> 01:28:47.422
SO I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS, AND

01:28:47.488 --> 01:28:49.524
I'D RESPECTFULLY ASK TO BE A

01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:51.959
COAUTHOR OF THIS LEGISLATION AS

01:28:52.026 --> 01:28:53.127
IT MOVES FORWARD. AND I'D LIKE

01:28:53.194 --> 01:28:55.697
TO MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU. WE

01:28:55.763 --> 01:28:57.799
HAVE A MOTION. AND DO YOU HAVE A

01:28:57.865 --> 01:29:00.034
SECOND, SECOND VICE MEMBER,

01:29:00.101 --> 01:29:01.102
STEPHANIE, AND ANY OTHER

01:29:01.169 --> 01:29:03.538
COMMENTS FROM THE DÍAS

01:29:03.604 --> 01:29:04.572
QUESTIONS? ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:29:04.639 --> 01:29:08.576
MACEDO THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR.

01:29:08.643 --> 01:29:10.411
YOU KNOW, READING THROUGH THIS,

01:29:10.478 --> 01:29:12.180
I READ IT THROUGH MULTIPLE TIMES

01:29:12.246 --> 01:29:14.282
JUST SO I WOULD UNDERSTAND IT.

01:29:14.348 --> 01:29:16.517
AND I HAVE SOME VERY SERIOUS

01:29:16.584 --> 01:29:18.086
CONCERNS. THERE ARE PARTS OF IT

01:29:18.152 --> 01:29:20.221
THAT I ACTUALLY AGREE WITH WHEN

01:29:20.288 --> 01:29:21.055
IT COMES TO MONEY FROM FOREIGN

01:29:21.122 --> 01:29:23.424
NATIONS AND THINGS LIKE THAT,

01:29:23.491 --> 01:29:24.859
BUT I CAN TELL YOU AS A

01:29:24.926 --> 01:29:26.594
CANDIDATE, I RECEIVED A $12 AND

01:29:26.661 --> 01:29:29.230
50 CENT CONTRIBUTION AND I CAN

01:29:29.297 --> 01:29:30.765
TELL YOU THE NAME OF THAT

01:29:30.832 --> 01:29:32.033
PERSON. I CAN TELL YOU I STILL

01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:33.401
TALK TO THAT PERSON WHEN THEY

01:29:33.468 --> 01:29:35.136
FEEL A CERTAIN TYPE OF WAY ABOUT

01:29:35.203 --> 01:29:37.238
THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO IMPACT

01:29:37.305 --> 01:29:38.673
OUR DISTRICT THE SAME WAY. I

01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:40.408
TALK TO SOMEBODY WHO WROTE ME A

01:29:40.475 --> 01:29:41.676
MAXOUT CHECK. WHY IS THAT?

01:29:41.743 --> 01:29:42.844
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT $12.50 TO

01:29:42.910 --> 01:29:44.378
THAT PERSON MEANT MORE PROBABLY

01:29:44.445 --> 01:29:46.347
THAN THE PERSON WHO WROTE ME A

01:29:46.414 --> 01:29:47.081
$5,000 CHECK WITHOUT THINKING

01:29:47.148 --> 01:29:48.182
TWICE. AND WHEN I TALKED TO THAT

01:29:48.249 --> 01:29:50.451
PERSON OF WHY THEY GAVE ME

01:29:50.518 --> 01:29:51.986
$12.50, IT WAS THAT THEY DIDN'T

01:29:52.053 --> 01:29:53.988
HAVE A LOT OF MONEY. BUT THEY

01:29:54.055 --> 01:29:55.757
WANTED ME TO KNOW AND THE PUBLIC

01:29:55.823 --> 01:29:57.458
TO KNOW IN MY REPORTING THAT

01:29:57.525 --> 01:29:58.726
THEY SUPPORTED MY CAMPAIGN AND

01:29:58.793 --> 01:30:01.195
MY FOUNDATION AND WHAT I VALUED.

01:30:01.262 --> 01:30:04.632
THEY SUPPORTED MY VALUES. I ALSO

01:30:04.699 --> 01:30:07.235
COME FROM AN AREA OF CALIFORNIA

01:30:07.301 --> 01:30:11.239
THAT IS VERY IT'S INTERESTING

01:30:11.305 --> 01:30:13.374
BECAUSE I ACTUALLY COME FROM A

01:30:13.441 --> 01:30:15.176
RELATIVELY NEUTRAL DISTRICT

01:30:15.243 --> 01:30:16.611
EQUAL TO REPUBLICANS AND

01:30:16.677 --> 01:30:17.345
DEMOCRATS. SO IT'D BE

01:30:17.411 --> 01:30:18.846
INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THINGS

01:30:18.913 --> 01:30:20.281
LIKE THIS WOULD BE FUNDED. BUT

01:30:20.348 --> 01:30:22.850
MY MAIN QUESTION IS, WHAT WOULD

01:30:22.917 --> 01:30:24.585
BE THE TOTAL COST OF

01:30:24.652 --> 01:30:26.220
IMPLEMENTING A PUBLIC FINANCING

01:30:26.287 --> 01:30:27.789
OR PUBLIC CAMPAIGN FINANCING

01:30:27.855 --> 01:30:29.757
ACROSS CALIFORNIA FIRST? AND

01:30:29.824 --> 01:30:32.293
THEN SECONDLY, WHAT WOULD BE THE

01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:34.228
AVERAGE COST AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

01:30:34.295 --> 01:30:35.429
OF IMPLEMENTING SOMETHING LIKE

01:30:35.496 --> 01:30:39.267
THIS? SO BECAUSE THERE IS NO

01:30:39.333 --> 01:30:41.803
SPECIFIC MODALITY, AND IN FACT,

01:30:41.869 --> 01:30:44.305
IF THERE'S NO CITY THAT DECIDES

01:30:44.372 --> 01:30:46.040
TO ENACT IT, THEN THE COST IS

01:30:46.107 --> 01:30:47.909
ZERO. SO IT DEPENDS ON HOW MANY

01:30:47.975 --> 01:30:49.844
CITIES, IF ANY, DECIDE THAT THEY

01:30:49.911 --> 01:30:51.179
WANT TO HAVE PUBLIC FINANCING.

01:30:51.245 --> 01:30:52.380
BUT TO YOUR POINT,

01:30:52.446 --> 01:30:54.982
ASSEMBLYMEMBER MACEDO, THAT

01:30:55.049 --> 01:30:57.185
PERSON WHO DONATED $12.50 TO

01:30:57.251 --> 01:30:59.187
YOUR CAMPAIGN, WHO YOU REMEMBER,

01:30:59.253 --> 01:31:01.355
THIS EMPOWERS THEM. THIS THIS

01:31:01.422 --> 01:31:03.658
ACTUALLY INCREASES THEIR VOICE.

01:31:03.724 --> 01:31:05.626
SO TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU'RE

01:31:05.693 --> 01:31:07.461
RESPONSIVE AND I'M GLAD YOU ARE

01:31:07.528 --> 01:31:08.863
RESPONSIVE TO THAT VERY SMALL

01:31:08.930 --> 01:31:13.935
DONOR, THIS BASICALLY INCREASES

01:31:14.001 --> 01:31:15.636
THEIR POWER EXPONENTIALLY. AND

01:31:15.703 --> 01:31:18.706
SO THAT'S THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF

01:31:18.773 --> 01:31:20.074
ALLOWING CITIES TO DECIDE

01:31:20.141 --> 01:31:21.843
WHETHER THEY WANT TO INCREASE

01:31:21.909 --> 01:31:23.311
THE POWER OF THOSE $12 AND 50

01:31:23.377 --> 01:31:26.280
CENT VOTERS OR NOT. SO THAT

01:31:26.347 --> 01:31:27.582
ACTUALLY TAKES ME TO MY FINAL

01:31:27.648 --> 01:31:29.083
QUESTION. AND THEN I'M GOING TO

01:31:29.150 --> 01:31:31.385
JUMP BACK UP. IF I WERE TO ASK

01:31:31.452 --> 01:31:34.021
THAT PERSON IF THEIR MONEY WAS

01:31:34.088 --> 01:31:36.991
GOING TO A CANDIDATE OR TO A

01:31:37.058 --> 01:31:38.793
CAUSE THAT HAD A VERY, VERY

01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:40.294
DIFFERENT PLATFORM THAN I DID,

01:31:40.361 --> 01:31:41.662
THEY ACTUALLY WANTED TO RAISE

01:31:41.729 --> 01:31:42.797
TAXES. THIS OTHER CANDIDATE,

01:31:42.864 --> 01:31:44.098
THAT'S WHAT THEIR MONEY WAS

01:31:44.165 --> 01:31:45.333
GOING TO, THEIR TAXPAYER DOLLARS

01:31:45.399 --> 01:31:47.368
IS GOING TO A CANDIDATE THAT

01:31:47.435 --> 01:31:48.035
WANTS TO RAISE TAXES, AND THEY

01:31:48.102 --> 01:31:49.804
DISAGREE WITH THAT. HOW IS THAT

01:31:49.871 --> 01:31:51.405
FUNDAMENTALLY FAIR TO THAT

01:31:51.472 --> 01:31:53.474
PERSON? RIGHT. SO THIS DOESN'T

01:31:53.541 --> 01:31:54.842
REQUIRE THAT TAXPAYER DOLLARS

01:31:54.909 --> 01:31:56.677
NECESSARILY GO TO ANY PARTICULAR

01:31:56.744 --> 01:31:58.179
PERSON. IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY

01:31:58.246 --> 01:31:59.714
REQUIRE THAT THERE BE A MATCH.

01:31:59.780 --> 01:32:03.084
IT IT IT IS UP TO THE LOCAL CITY

01:32:03.150 --> 01:32:05.052
TO DECIDE HOW THEY WANT TO

01:32:05.119 --> 01:32:06.821
IMPLEMENT IT AND IF THEY WANT TO

01:32:06.888 --> 01:32:08.990
IMPLEMENT IT. SO TO THAT $12 AND

01:32:09.056 --> 01:32:10.791
50 CENT VOTER, TO THE EXTENT

01:32:10.858 --> 01:32:12.660
THAT THEIR CITY SAYS NO, THERE'S

01:32:12.727 --> 01:32:14.795
NO CONCERN TO THE EXTENT THAT

01:32:14.862 --> 01:32:17.565
THAT THEY SUPPORT, FOR EXAMPLE,

01:32:17.632 --> 01:32:19.367
HAVING SOME SORT OF A MATCH,

01:32:19.433 --> 01:32:20.968
THEN THEY HAVE A VOICE THROUGH

01:32:21.035 --> 01:32:23.037
THEIR CITY COUNCIL TO EITHER

01:32:23.104 --> 01:32:24.372
EXERCISE THAT VOICE AND ADOPT

01:32:24.438 --> 01:32:27.341
IT, OR TO OR TO REJECT IT. OKAY.

01:32:27.408 --> 01:32:28.809
IT'S PERFECT. YOU'RE LEADING MY

01:32:28.876 --> 01:32:30.244
THIRD AND FINAL QUESTION, WHICH

01:32:30.311 --> 01:32:32.647
IS THEN WHAT OVERSIGHT

01:32:32.713 --> 01:32:34.248
MECHANISMS ARE GOING TO BE IN

01:32:34.315 --> 01:32:35.983
PLACE TO PREVENT? BECAUSE,

01:32:36.050 --> 01:32:37.184
LISTEN, I WOULD LOVE TO BELIEVE

01:32:37.251 --> 01:32:38.719
THAT EVERY CITY COUNCIL MEMBER

01:32:38.786 --> 01:32:41.355
IN EVERY CITY IN CALIFORNIA IS

01:32:41.422 --> 01:32:43.224
DOING THE RIGHT THING. I REALLY

01:32:43.291 --> 01:32:44.959
WOULD LOVE TO BELIEVE THAT. BUT

01:32:45.026 --> 01:32:46.027
LET'S JUST SAY EVERYBODY HAS A

01:32:46.093 --> 01:32:47.428
BAD DAY. WHAT MECHANISMS ARE IN

01:32:47.495 --> 01:32:50.031
PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT IF THIS

01:32:50.097 --> 01:32:52.533
IS BEING SPENT ON FRIVOLOUS

01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:54.669
CAMPAIGNS OR CANDIDATES WHO

01:32:54.735 --> 01:32:57.605
MAYBE AREN'T AS SERIOUS? WHAT

01:32:57.672 --> 01:32:59.173
MECHANISM IS THERE THEN FOR US

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:00.908
WHO ARE VOTING ON THIS AND

01:33:00.975 --> 01:33:02.209
EMPOWERING THEM? GRANTED, WE ARE

01:33:02.276 --> 01:33:03.411
GIVING LOCAL CONTROL, BUT WE'RE

01:33:03.477 --> 01:33:05.579
EMPOWERING THEM TO DO THIS TO

01:33:05.646 --> 01:33:07.081
MAKE SURE THAT THIS ISN'T GOING

01:33:07.148 --> 01:33:10.651
TO HAPPEN. SO AGAIN, THAT'S UP

01:33:10.718 --> 01:33:13.454
TO LOCAL ENTITY TO DECIDE THAT.

01:33:13.521 --> 01:33:15.523
AND OF COURSE, THERE'S THERE IS

01:33:15.589 --> 01:33:16.590
OVERSIGHT. I WAS A FEDERAL

01:33:16.657 --> 01:33:18.492
PROSECUTOR BACK IN THE DAY AND

01:33:18.559 --> 01:33:20.561
ACTUALLY PROSECUTED CORRUPTION

01:33:20.628 --> 01:33:23.164
CASES. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT

01:33:23.230 --> 01:33:24.966
THERE'S A FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF

01:33:25.032 --> 01:33:26.033
JUSTICE THAT CARES ABOUT

01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:27.902
POLITICAL CORRUPTION, THAT

01:33:27.969 --> 01:33:29.337
PROVIDES SOME SORT OF OVERSIGHT.

01:33:29.403 --> 01:33:31.205
SAME THING WITH THE CALIFORNIA

01:33:31.272 --> 01:33:32.173
ATTORNEY GENERAL, SAME THING

01:33:32.239 --> 01:33:33.107
WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY, SAME

01:33:33.174 --> 01:33:34.775
THING WITH CITY ATTORNEYS. SO

01:33:34.842 --> 01:33:36.444
ANY CITY WHO ENACTS ANY SORT OF

01:33:36.510 --> 01:33:38.045
PUBLIC FINANCING OR ANY

01:33:38.112 --> 01:33:40.181
FINANCING MECHANISM, IT'S UP TO

01:33:40.247 --> 01:33:41.782
THAT CITY TO GO AHEAD AND

01:33:41.849 --> 01:33:43.351
PROVIDE SOME SORT OF OVERSIGHT.

01:33:43.417 --> 01:33:46.220
IF THEY DON'T, THEN THE

01:33:46.287 --> 01:33:46.887
OVERSIGHT OF THE DISTRICT

01:33:46.954 --> 01:33:48.222
ATTORNEY, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL,

01:33:48.289 --> 01:33:49.357
AND TO THE EXTENT THE DEPARTMENT

01:33:49.423 --> 01:33:51.359
OF JUSTICE STILL CARES ABOUT

01:33:51.425 --> 01:33:53.394
PUBLIC CORRUPTION, THEY PROVIDE

01:33:53.461 --> 01:33:55.162
OVERSIGHT. I THINK THAT'S JUST

01:33:55.229 --> 01:33:57.064
FAR TOO BROAD. IF I'M BEING

01:33:57.131 --> 01:33:58.499
HONEST. THERE'S NOT ENOUGH

01:33:58.566 --> 01:34:00.801
GUARDRAILS IN PLACE THAT IF THIS

01:34:00.868 --> 01:34:02.436
DOES PROCEED FORWARD, I REALLY

01:34:02.503 --> 01:34:03.804
HOPE THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO HAND

01:34:03.871 --> 01:34:06.374
OVER THIS UNBRIDLED POWER, THAT

01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:07.808
IT COMES WITH SOME GUARDRAILS,

01:34:07.875 --> 01:34:09.543
BECAUSE ONE THING THAT WE SEE

01:34:09.610 --> 01:34:10.745
HAPPEN IS WE PASS LEGISLATION

01:34:10.811 --> 01:34:12.747
OUT OF SACRAMENTO. WE KIND OF

01:34:12.813 --> 01:34:14.148
SEE IT'S WAY OUT OF THE DOOR,

01:34:14.215 --> 01:34:16.450
AND THEN WE'RE NOT CHECKING BACK

01:34:16.517 --> 01:34:17.852
UP ON IT. I WOULD REALLY URGE

01:34:17.918 --> 01:34:19.320
MORE GUARDRAILS IN PLACE FOR

01:34:19.387 --> 01:34:20.821
SOMETHING LIKE THIS. I DON'T

01:34:20.888 --> 01:34:21.956
SUPPORT THIS. I'D LOVE TO SIT

01:34:22.023 --> 01:34:24.091
DOWN AND TALK WITH YOU SO MAYBE

01:34:24.158 --> 01:34:25.893
I CAN UNDERSTAND THIS BETTER,

01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:27.194
BUT I JUST DON'T AGREE WITH

01:34:27.261 --> 01:34:29.497
TAXPAYER DOLLARS GOING TO

01:34:29.563 --> 01:34:30.731
CAMPAIGN. SO I'M SORRY I'M NOT

01:34:30.798 --> 01:34:31.966
ABLE TO SUPPORT TODAY, BUT LOOK

01:34:32.033 --> 01:34:34.101
FORWARD TO CHATTING WITH YOU

01:34:34.168 --> 01:34:34.969
ABOUT IT. AND SO IF I MIGHT

01:34:35.036 --> 01:34:36.971
RESPOND, MADAM CHAIR, IS THAT

01:34:37.038 --> 01:34:39.373
WE'RE OPEN. IF THERE'S SOME SORT

01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:41.008
OF GUARDRAIL THAT YOU MIGHT

01:34:41.075 --> 01:34:43.077
PROPOSE, WE'RE OPEN TO THAT.

01:34:43.144 --> 01:34:44.912
WE'RE OPEN TO MAKING SURE THAT

01:34:44.979 --> 01:34:47.048
THAT WHATEVER MECHANISM IS

01:34:47.114 --> 01:34:49.250
ADOPTED IS DONE SO WITH PUBLIC'S

01:34:49.316 --> 01:34:51.052
INTEREST IN MIND. AND MAKE SURE

01:34:51.118 --> 01:34:52.453
THAT THAT THERE ARE NO

01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:53.921
ABERRATIONS THAT THAT MIGHT, FOR

01:34:53.988 --> 01:34:55.589
EXAMPLE, SKEW THE PROCESS JUST

01:34:55.656 --> 01:34:58.025
AS A AS A SIDE NOTE, TO THE

01:34:58.092 --> 01:34:59.660
EXTENT THAT FOLKS BELIEVE THAT

01:34:59.727 --> 01:35:02.730
THIS IS A PARTIZAN ISSUE,

01:35:02.797 --> 01:35:04.865
ARIZONA HAD THE MOST PROGRESSIVE

01:35:04.932 --> 01:35:07.134
PUBLIC FINANCING MECHANISM IN

01:35:07.201 --> 01:35:10.671
THE COUNTRY. AND IN THE ARIZONA

01:35:10.738 --> 01:35:13.040
MODEL. I BELIEVE THAT A MAJORITY

01:35:13.107 --> 01:35:15.810
OF REPUBLICANS WERE ELECTED TO

01:35:15.876 --> 01:35:16.777
STATEWIDE OFFICE. THERE WERE

01:35:16.844 --> 01:35:17.878
REPUBLICANS ELECTED STATEWIDE

01:35:17.945 --> 01:35:18.646
OFFICE. UNFORTUNATELY, THE

01:35:18.712 --> 01:35:20.648
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT

01:35:20.714 --> 01:35:22.883
BASICALLY SAID THAT THAT THEIR

01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:25.553
PUBLIC FINANCING MODALITY, WHICH

01:35:25.619 --> 01:35:28.089
ACTUALLY MATCHED INDEPENDENT

01:35:28.155 --> 01:35:29.390
EXPENDITURES, WAS

01:35:29.457 --> 01:35:30.791
UNCONSTITUTIONAL. AND SO THUS IT

01:35:30.858 --> 01:35:33.360
DOESN'T EXIST ANYMORE. BUT TO

01:35:33.427 --> 01:35:35.563
THE EXTENT THAT THAT WHATEVER

01:35:35.629 --> 01:35:38.799
MECHANISM IS IN PLACE BENEFITS

01:35:38.866 --> 01:35:41.235
ONE PARTY, THAT IS TO BE

01:35:41.302 --> 01:35:42.670
DETERMINED BY THE VOTERS

01:35:42.736 --> 01:35:43.971
THEMSELVES AS TO WHETHER OR NOT

01:35:44.038 --> 01:35:46.340
THERE'S A BENEFIT TO ONE PARTY

01:35:46.407 --> 01:35:48.809
OR ONE CANDIDATE. THANK YOU.

01:35:48.876 --> 01:35:51.846
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. STEPHANIE.

01:35:51.912 --> 01:35:54.315
OKAY, I SAW TWO HANDS OVER

01:35:54.381 --> 01:35:57.084
THERE. NOW I DON'T KNOW. OKAY,

01:35:57.151 --> 01:35:58.652
SURE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THANK

01:35:58.719 --> 01:36:00.321
YOU, MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU TO

01:36:00.387 --> 01:36:01.222
THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS UP.

01:36:01.288 --> 01:36:02.523
ACTUALLY, THIS IS AN INTERESTING

01:36:02.590 --> 01:36:04.391
DISCUSSION. JUST FOR A FUN FACT,

01:36:04.458 --> 01:36:06.127
I STARTED ELECTED OFFICE AT THE

01:36:06.193 --> 01:36:07.962
AT THE AGE OF 23 YEARS OLD. I'M

01:36:08.028 --> 01:36:10.197
44 NOW, SO 22 YEARS AGO I WAS

01:36:10.264 --> 01:36:11.899
RUNNING FOR OFFICE AT THE AGE OF

01:36:11.966 --> 01:36:15.402
22, IN 2003, AND IT WAS LIKE AT

01:36:15.469 --> 01:36:17.271
23. AND I THINK THE MOST I

01:36:17.338 --> 01:36:19.039
RAISED THAT YEAR TOTAL WAS

01:36:19.106 --> 01:36:20.508
$10,000. AS A YOUNG SCHOOL BOARD

01:36:20.574 --> 01:36:22.443
MEMBER CANDIDATE, OBVIOUSLY, YOU

01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:24.245
KNOW, NOT HAVING A BIG WAR CHEST

01:36:24.311 --> 01:36:26.280
OR A BIG NETWORK OF FRIENDS, BUT

01:36:26.347 --> 01:36:27.515
THOSE PROFESSORS AND FRIENDS

01:36:27.581 --> 01:36:29.350
THAT KNEW ME AND HIGH SCHOOL

01:36:29.416 --> 01:36:31.352
TEACHERS TO MY LOCAL SCHOOL

01:36:31.418 --> 01:36:32.419
BOARD, IT WAS AN INTERESTING

01:36:32.486 --> 01:36:33.854
TIME. OBVIOUSLY, THINGS HAVE

01:36:33.921 --> 01:36:35.556
PROGRESSED AND I'VE BEEN ABLE TO

01:36:35.623 --> 01:36:37.057
ENHANCE MY NETWORK AND FOLKS

01:36:37.124 --> 01:36:39.627
THAT I KNOW AND BEING THIS IS MY

01:36:39.693 --> 01:36:41.195
SEVENTH TIME BEING ELECTED TO

01:36:41.262 --> 01:36:43.297
OFFICE. I THEN RAN FOR CITY

01:36:43.364 --> 01:36:45.533
COUNCIL AND YOU KNOW, THE STATE

01:36:45.599 --> 01:36:48.602
HAD THE $5,500 AT THE TIME, MAX

01:36:48.669 --> 01:36:50.671
PER PER CONTRIBUTION. WE, THE

01:36:50.738 --> 01:36:52.006
CITY OF LYNWOOD, WE ACTUALLY

01:36:52.072 --> 01:36:53.807
CHANGED IT TO $3,000 BECAUSE WE

01:36:53.874 --> 01:36:55.809
THOUGHT 3000 WAS A LITTLE BETTER

01:36:55.876 --> 01:36:57.645
THAN $4,500, RIGHT? SOMEONE

01:36:57.711 --> 01:36:59.146
COULD ARGUE THAT'S STILL TOO

01:36:59.213 --> 01:37:00.347
MUCH, BUT THAT'S BETTER THAN

01:37:00.414 --> 01:37:01.549
$5,500, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, AS AS

01:37:01.615 --> 01:37:03.450
ONE OF YOUR WITNESSES AND I WILL

01:37:03.517 --> 01:37:04.118
HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ON

01:37:04.185 --> 01:37:06.020
OTHER BILLS AND OTHER IDEAS THAT

01:37:06.086 --> 01:37:08.155
WE HAVE. YOU KNOW, WE'RE SO

01:37:08.222 --> 01:37:08.822
GREAT AT LEGISLATORS, AT PASSING

01:37:08.889 --> 01:37:10.491
LAWS, BUT WE DON'T DO IT FOR

01:37:10.558 --> 01:37:12.259
OURSELVES. WE DO IT FOR OUR

01:37:12.326 --> 01:37:13.961
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, BUT WE DON'T

01:37:14.028 --> 01:37:14.862
DO IT FOR OURSELVES. BUT THAT'S

01:37:14.929 --> 01:37:16.397
A THAT'S A TO BE CONTINUED

01:37:16.463 --> 01:37:17.264
CONVERSATION. I WILL BE

01:37:17.331 --> 01:37:18.799
SUPPORTING, OF COURSE, THIS THIS

01:37:18.866 --> 01:37:20.134
TODAY. BUT IT'S JUST I WANT TO

01:37:20.201 --> 01:37:22.336
ADD THAT THAT FUN FACT OF LIKE

01:37:22.403 --> 01:37:24.205
WHEN I STARTED TO NOW AND THEN

01:37:24.271 --> 01:37:25.873
AGAIN, THE FACT THAT I WAS ABLE

01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:28.275
TO VOTE ON CASTING A, A LOWER

01:37:28.342 --> 01:37:29.376
AMOUNT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AT A

01:37:29.443 --> 01:37:30.678
LOCAL CITY COUNCIL, WE ARE A

01:37:30.744 --> 01:37:33.247
GENERAL LAW CITY. WE'RE NOT A

01:37:33.314 --> 01:37:33.881
CHARTER CITY, LINWOOD, BUT WE

01:37:33.948 --> 01:37:35.382
WERE ABLE TO CHANGE THAT, TO

01:37:35.449 --> 01:37:36.784
CHANGE THE DYNAMIC AND GIVE

01:37:36.850 --> 01:37:38.219
OTHER FOLKS OPPORTUNITY TO DO A

01:37:38.285 --> 01:37:39.086
MAX PER YEAR CONTRIBUTION. AND I

01:37:39.153 --> 01:37:41.288
SAY THAT BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, AS A

01:37:41.355 --> 01:37:42.122
YOUNG ELECTED OFFICIAL, I WAS

01:37:42.189 --> 01:37:44.058
PART OF A NETWORK CALLED THE

01:37:44.124 --> 01:37:44.925
YOUNG ELECTED OFFICIALS NETWORK,

01:37:44.992 --> 01:37:46.360
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE

01:37:46.427 --> 01:37:49.430
ALL STRUGGLED WITH. HOW DO WE

01:37:49.496 --> 01:37:50.064
FOLKS THAT ARE YOUNGER HAVE A

01:37:50.130 --> 01:37:50.931
VOICE, RIGHT. BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

01:37:50.998 --> 01:37:53.167
WE CAN'T COMPETE WITH THE THAT

01:37:53.234 --> 01:37:54.835
RETIRED PERSON THAT HAS A

01:37:54.902 --> 01:37:57.538
DIFFERENT NETWORK. AND FOR US,

01:37:57.605 --> 01:37:59.373
OF US, I HAVE TO HAVE STILL WORK

01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:01.175
AND THEN STILL SERVE IN LOCAL

01:38:01.242 --> 01:38:02.676
OFFICE AS A PART TIME JOB

01:38:02.743 --> 01:38:04.044
BECAUSE IT'S NOT A FULL TIME

01:38:04.111 --> 01:38:06.380
JOB. HOW DO WE HOW DO WE BALANCE

01:38:06.447 --> 01:38:07.081
THAT? SO I THINK THIS

01:38:07.147 --> 01:38:08.949
DISCUSSION, I'VE HEARD IT FOR

01:38:09.016 --> 01:38:10.150
MANY YEARS, AND IT'S JUST NOW

01:38:10.217 --> 01:38:11.685
BEING A NEW LEGISLATOR, IT'S

01:38:11.752 --> 01:38:13.454
INTERESTING TO SEE THAT IT COULD

01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:14.555
BE A POSSIBILITY AND GIVE GIVE

01:38:14.622 --> 01:38:15.889
THE CALIFORNIA VOTERS,

01:38:15.956 --> 01:38:16.991
ESPECIALLY IN A TIME WHERE OUR

01:38:17.057 --> 01:38:18.025
DEMOCRACY IS AT STAKE. AND I

01:38:18.092 --> 01:38:19.960
THINK I THINK THAT'S THE VOICES

01:38:20.027 --> 01:38:21.428
THAT I HEARD TODAY WITH THE

01:38:21.495 --> 01:38:22.830
PEOPLE HERE TODAY. AND SO I

01:38:22.896 --> 01:38:25.366
THINK LET THE PUBLIC DECIDE. AND

01:38:25.432 --> 01:38:25.966
HOPEFULLY, I WOULD HOPE THAT

01:38:26.033 --> 01:38:26.934
LOCAL GOVERNMENT WOULD DO THE

01:38:27.001 --> 01:38:28.402
RIGHT THING. I AM REALLY

01:38:28.469 --> 01:38:29.603
INTRIGUED BY BY BY THE MEMBER

01:38:29.670 --> 01:38:32.039
FROM TULARE TO SEE WHAT, YOU

01:38:32.106 --> 01:38:33.474
KNOW, THOSE THINGS THAT SHE'S

01:38:33.540 --> 01:38:34.475
INTERESTED IN LEARNING. I'M

01:38:34.541 --> 01:38:35.576
INTERESTED TO DISCUSS THAT

01:38:35.643 --> 01:38:37.011
BECAUSE I ALSO BELIEVE THERE'S

01:38:37.077 --> 01:38:38.145
NO COOKIE CUTTER APPROACH TO

01:38:38.212 --> 01:38:39.179
ANYTHING. RIGHT? AND THAT EVERY

01:38:39.246 --> 01:38:40.314
CITY, EVERY GOVERNMENT, EVERY

01:38:40.381 --> 01:38:42.149
COUNTY IS DIFFERENT. SO I AM

01:38:42.216 --> 01:38:43.884
INTRIGUED BY HER QUESTION, AND

01:38:43.951 --> 01:38:44.451
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT

01:38:44.518 --> 01:38:45.019
DISCUSSION AS WELL. BUT FOR

01:38:45.085 --> 01:38:47.288
TODAY, I LOOK FORWARD TO MOVING

01:38:47.354 --> 01:38:48.055
THIS FORWARD. AND I WOULD ALSO

01:38:48.122 --> 01:38:50.124
LIKE TO BE A COAUTHOR. GREAT.

01:38:50.190 --> 01:38:52.092
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND I DO

01:38:52.159 --> 01:38:53.394
WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO POINT

01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:56.130
OUT YOUR NUMBER ONE FAN IN THE

01:38:56.196 --> 01:38:56.997
ROOM WHO'S HERE TODAY, AND THAT

01:38:57.064 --> 01:38:58.299
IS YOUR FATHER WHO'S HERE WITH

01:38:58.365 --> 01:39:00.200
US. SO WE JUST WANT TO WELCOME

01:39:00.267 --> 01:39:04.305
YOU. AND NOW, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:39:04.371 --> 01:39:06.573
STEPHANIE. THANK YOU, CHAIR. AND

01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:08.175
THANK YOU TO SENATOR UMBERG FOR

01:39:08.242 --> 01:39:09.276
BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I WASN'T

01:39:09.343 --> 01:39:11.412
GOING TO SPEAK, BUT I AM. I'VE

01:39:11.478 --> 01:39:12.179
BENEFITED FROM PUBLIC FINANCING.

01:39:12.246 --> 01:39:14.581
I WAS ON THE BOARD OF

01:39:14.648 --> 01:39:15.215
SUPERVISORS IN SAN FRANCISCO,

01:39:15.282 --> 01:39:17.451
AND IN 2018 WHEN I RAN, I RAN

01:39:17.518 --> 01:39:18.719
AGAINST A VERY WELL-FUNDED

01:39:18.786 --> 01:39:20.888
OPPONENT WHO SPENT $1.2 MILLION

01:39:20.954 --> 01:39:23.090
OF HIS OWN MONEY. I RAISED

01:39:23.157 --> 01:39:25.292
484,000. I WAS STILL ABLE TO WIN

01:39:25.359 --> 01:39:28.128
BECAUSE I WAS KNOWN AND IN THE

01:39:28.195 --> 01:39:29.496
NEIGHBORHOOD, AND I WAS SOMEONE

01:39:29.563 --> 01:39:30.998
WHO WORKED IN THE COMMUNITY FOR

01:39:31.065 --> 01:39:32.499
A LONG TIME. BUT THAT THAT

01:39:32.566 --> 01:39:34.568
PUBLIC FINANCING, IT WASN'T

01:39:34.635 --> 01:39:35.836
EASY, YOU KNOW, IT WASN'T JUST I

01:39:35.903 --> 01:39:38.138
WAS GIVEN MONEY AND I WAS JUST

01:39:38.205 --> 01:39:40.140
TALKING TO MY CHIEF OF STAFF,

01:39:40.207 --> 01:39:41.942
AND IT WAS DEFINITELY IN THE WAY

01:39:42.009 --> 01:39:44.678
THAT IT HAPPENS IN SAN FRANCISCO

01:39:44.745 --> 01:39:45.279
IS PROPORTIONAL TO DONATIONS

01:39:45.346 --> 01:39:48.482
WITH A CAP. AND WE HAD TO PROVE

01:39:48.549 --> 01:39:50.384
SUBMIT PROOF OF EACH INDIVIDUAL

01:39:50.451 --> 01:39:52.186
DONOR PROOF THAT THEY LIVE IN

01:39:52.252 --> 01:39:55.823
SF. IT WAS THEN AUDITED AND WE,

01:39:55.889 --> 01:39:57.658
MY CAMPAIGN DID NOT GET A CHECK

01:39:57.725 --> 01:39:59.827
UNTIL THOSE GUARDRAILS AND THOSE

01:39:59.893 --> 01:40:02.329
MEASURES WERE ACCOMPLISHED. AND,

01:40:02.396 --> 01:40:04.732
YOU KNOW, THERE WERE TIMES WHEN

01:40:04.798 --> 01:40:07.701
THERE WAS JUST NO WAY TO MAKE

01:40:07.768 --> 01:40:09.603
CERTAIN WE WOULD EVEN HAVE THAT

01:40:09.670 --> 01:40:10.371
MONEY, BECAUSE WE DIDN'T KNOW

01:40:10.437 --> 01:40:13.006
WHETHER OR NOT, YOU KNOW, WE

01:40:13.073 --> 01:40:14.908
DIDN'T KNOW HOW MUCH WE WOULD

01:40:14.975 --> 01:40:17.344
GET BASED ON WHETHER OR NOT WE

01:40:17.411 --> 01:40:18.212
WERE ABLE TO PROVE SOMEONE LIVED

01:40:18.278 --> 01:40:19.847
AT THE MOMENT IN TIME. ANYWAY,

01:40:19.913 --> 01:40:21.448
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS THAT

01:40:21.515 --> 01:40:22.783
THERE ARE GUARDRAILS. SO I SEE

01:40:22.850 --> 01:40:25.018
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. I,

01:40:25.085 --> 01:40:28.122
ASSEMBLYMEMBER FROM TULARE, BUT

01:40:28.188 --> 01:40:29.990
WITH SAN FRANCISCO AND THE WAY

01:40:30.057 --> 01:40:31.825
THAT WE HAD TO PROVE EVERY

01:40:31.892 --> 01:40:33.927
SINGLE DONATION, THERE ARE

01:40:33.994 --> 01:40:35.129
GUARDRAILS IN PLACE. IT'S NOT

01:40:35.195 --> 01:40:36.764
JUST LIKE THEY GIVE MONEY, AND

01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:38.866
IT'S NOT JUST LIKE THEY GIVE

01:40:38.932 --> 01:40:40.834
MONEY TO ANY CAMPAIGN. AND ALSO

01:40:40.901 --> 01:40:43.036
THIS IDEA THAT IT'S GOING TO

01:40:43.103 --> 01:40:44.204
DETERMINE THE MAKEUP OF A BOARD,

01:40:44.271 --> 01:40:46.206
WHETHER OR NOT IT'S PROGRESSIVE

01:40:46.273 --> 01:40:48.742
OR CONSERVATIVE OR MODERATE. IN

01:40:48.809 --> 01:40:50.177
SAN FRANCISCO, I DON'T THINK

01:40:50.244 --> 01:40:52.012
PUBLIC FINANCING REALLY. IT

01:40:52.079 --> 01:40:54.515
HELPS THOSE WHO ARE BEING FUNDED

01:40:54.581 --> 01:40:55.983
BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE THEIR OWN

01:40:56.049 --> 01:40:58.118
MONEY, OR PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING

01:40:58.185 --> 01:40:59.520
TO DONATE IN LARGE AMOUNTS, AND

01:40:59.586 --> 01:41:00.954
IT REALLY HELPS THE INDIVIDUAL

01:41:01.021 --> 01:41:02.289
THAT HAS DONE THE WORK, WHO'S

01:41:02.356 --> 01:41:03.891
BEEN IN THE COMMUNITY, WHO

01:41:03.957 --> 01:41:05.859
DESERVES A POSITION ON THAT

01:41:05.926 --> 01:41:07.127
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. AND YOU

01:41:07.194 --> 01:41:08.962
KNOW, WHEN I RAN IN 2022, NO ONE

01:41:09.029 --> 01:41:10.864
RAN AGAINST ME. SO I DIDN'T NEED

01:41:10.931 --> 01:41:12.065
PUBLIC FINANCING. BUT IT'S

01:41:12.132 --> 01:41:14.201
SOMETHING THAT I SEE IS SO

01:41:14.268 --> 01:41:15.903
VALUABLE TO THOSE THAT ARE DOING

01:41:15.969 --> 01:41:18.939
THE WORK THAT DESERVE TO BE IN

01:41:19.006 --> 01:41:22.209
PLACES WHERE THEY HAVE

01:41:22.276 --> 01:41:23.644
INFLUENCE, AND THEY MIGHT NOT

01:41:23.710 --> 01:41:25.446
HAVE IT. IF PEOPLE CAN JUST

01:41:25.512 --> 01:41:27.915
WRITE THEIR OWN TICKETS TO. AND

01:41:27.981 --> 01:41:29.750
I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR IT. SO I

01:41:29.817 --> 01:41:30.851
FELT COMPELLED TO SPEAK UP,

01:41:30.918 --> 01:41:32.286
BECAUSE IN SAN FRANCISCO THEY

01:41:32.352 --> 01:41:34.688
MAKE IT VERY HARD TO GET. IT IS

01:41:34.755 --> 01:41:36.557
MY WHOLE POINT, AND I THINK

01:41:36.623 --> 01:41:37.991
THAT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW BECAUSE

01:41:38.058 --> 01:41:39.493
I SEE YOUR CONCERNS. YOU JUST

01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:41.295
DON'T WANT PUBLIC TAX DOLLARS

01:41:41.361 --> 01:41:43.063
GOING TO ANYONE FOR ANY CAUSE.

01:41:43.130 --> 01:41:45.332
BUT YOU REALLY HAVE TO IN THE

01:41:45.399 --> 01:41:48.168
WAY THAT WE DO IT IS YOU HAVE

01:41:48.235 --> 01:41:49.336
TO. THERE ARE GUARDRAILS IN

01:41:49.403 --> 01:41:51.038
PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT

01:41:51.104 --> 01:41:52.372
GIVING YOU MONEY AWAY. SO

01:41:52.439 --> 01:41:53.240
ANYWAY, THANK YOU FOR BRINGING

01:41:53.307 --> 01:41:55.409
THIS FORWARD. I WILL BE

01:41:55.476 --> 01:41:56.677
SUPPORTING IT. AND WE'RE GOING

01:41:56.743 --> 01:41:59.079
BACK TO JUST ONE MORE QUESTION.

01:41:59.146 --> 01:42:01.114
AND I DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU

01:42:01.181 --> 01:42:01.849
ANSWERED THIS PRIOR TO ME

01:42:01.915 --> 01:42:03.951
GETTING. SO IT SOUNDS LIKE A

01:42:04.017 --> 01:42:04.952
LOT. AND ESPECIALLY AT THE CITY

01:42:05.018 --> 01:42:06.687
LEVELS, THOSE ARE MAJORITY

01:42:06.753 --> 01:42:08.021
NONPARTIZAN SEATS. WOULD THIS ON

01:42:08.088 --> 01:42:09.389
THE BALLOT MEASURE OPEN IT UP

01:42:09.456 --> 01:42:10.757
TOWARDS PARTIZAN SEATS TO

01:42:10.824 --> 01:42:11.959
INCLUDING THE ASSEMBLY AND THE

01:42:12.025 --> 01:42:14.094
SENATE? WELL, IT DOESN'T APPLY

01:42:14.161 --> 01:42:15.162
TO LEGISLATIVE RACES FIRST OF

01:42:15.229 --> 01:42:17.798
ALL. AND SECONDLY, IT'S REALLY

01:42:17.865 --> 01:42:20.167
UP TO THE LOCAL CITY. IF THEY

01:42:20.234 --> 01:42:22.135
WANT TO PUT A D OR AN R BEHIND

01:42:22.202 --> 01:42:23.370
SOMEONE'S NAME, I BELIEVE THEY

01:42:23.437 --> 01:42:25.205
CAN DO SO. I CAN ASK THE EXPERTS

01:42:25.272 --> 01:42:27.140
HERE, BUT THAT'S THAT'S UP TO

01:42:27.207 --> 01:42:28.308
LOCAL CITY. ALL RIGHT. YEAH.

01:42:28.375 --> 01:42:30.744
THAT WAS I WAS JUST TRYING TO

01:42:30.811 --> 01:42:32.145
PROVIDE CLARITY ON THAT. I JUST

01:42:32.212 --> 01:42:33.680
DIDN'T KNOW BECAUSE MAJORITY OF

01:42:33.747 --> 01:42:34.648
OUR LOCAL ELECTIONS ARE

01:42:34.715 --> 01:42:35.749
NONPARTISAN SEATS. THEY DON'T

01:42:35.816 --> 01:42:37.050
HAVE A REGISTRATION ON THEIR

01:42:37.117 --> 01:42:38.685
BALLOT ON THAT ONE. I JUST

01:42:38.752 --> 01:42:40.020
DIDN'T KNOW IF THIS TRULY WOULD

01:42:40.087 --> 01:42:43.557
EXPAND IT TOWARDS THIS, DOESN'T

01:42:43.624 --> 01:42:45.826
EXPAND IT NOR CONTRACT IT. 30S.

01:42:45.893 --> 01:42:48.896
OKAY. THANK YOU. OKAY. AND WE'RE

01:42:48.962 --> 01:42:50.063
BACK NOW TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:42:50.130 --> 01:42:51.765
BENNETT. I JUST HOPE HOPEFULLY

01:42:51.832 --> 01:42:54.101
IN TERMS OF THE CLOSE. BUT, YOU

01:42:54.167 --> 01:42:56.036
KNOW, WE OFTENTIMES HAVE PEOPLE

01:42:56.103 --> 01:42:57.538
SAYING WE WANT TO HAVE LOCAL

01:42:57.604 --> 01:42:59.072
CONTROL, LOCAL CONTROL, LOCAL

01:42:59.139 --> 01:43:01.241
CONTROL, EXCEPT WHEN THEY DON'T

01:43:01.308 --> 01:43:03.143
WANT TO HAVE LOCALS DO SOMETHING

01:43:03.210 --> 01:43:05.612
THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO DO THIS

01:43:05.679 --> 01:43:08.048
THIS BILL ONLY DOES ONE THING.

01:43:08.115 --> 01:43:10.150
IT GIVES THE LOCALS THE OPTION

01:43:10.217 --> 01:43:13.487
TO DO SOMETHING. FIVE CHARTER

01:43:13.554 --> 01:43:15.088
CITIES HAVE MADE THIS DECISION

01:43:15.155 --> 01:43:17.391
TO DO THIS BECAUSE THE LAW

01:43:17.457 --> 01:43:18.525
ALLOWED THEM TO DO THIS. THAT'S

01:43:18.592 --> 01:43:21.061
LOCAL CONTROL. AND WE DON'T KNOW

01:43:21.128 --> 01:43:22.195
WHETHER THERE ARE FIVE GENERAL

01:43:22.262 --> 01:43:24.598
FUND CITIES THAT ARE WILLING TO

01:43:24.665 --> 01:43:26.767
DO THIS, BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE

01:43:26.833 --> 01:43:28.869
HAVE BLOCKED THEM AT THE

01:43:28.936 --> 01:43:30.203
LEGISLATIVE LEVEL, AT THE STATE.

01:43:30.270 --> 01:43:31.872
WE'VE BLOCKED A LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:43:31.939 --> 01:43:34.041
FROM SAYING, WE THINK WE CAN DO

01:43:34.107 --> 01:43:35.642
IT. WE THINK WE CAN DO IT RIGHT,

01:43:35.709 --> 01:43:36.877
AND WE THINK OUR CITIZENS

01:43:36.944 --> 01:43:38.078
SUPPORT IT. LET'S SEE IF THAT

01:43:38.145 --> 01:43:40.247
CAN HAPPEN. SEEMS HARD TO SEE

01:43:40.314 --> 01:43:41.949
WHY SOMEONE WOULD ARGUE AGAINST

01:43:42.015 --> 01:43:45.085
GIVING SOMEBODY, THE LOCALS, THE

01:43:45.152 --> 01:43:46.887
CONTROL TO MAKE THAT DECISION

01:43:46.954 --> 01:43:49.089
ABOUT HOW THEY HANDLE THIS

01:43:49.156 --> 01:43:51.992
PARTICULAR ISSUE. THANK YOU. ANY

01:43:52.059 --> 01:43:54.094
OTHER COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS OR

01:43:54.161 --> 01:43:56.430
QUESTIONS FROM THE DÍAS? SEEING

01:43:56.496 --> 01:43:58.031
NONE. SENATOR, YOU MAY CLOSE.

01:43:58.098 --> 01:43:59.199
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MADAM

01:43:59.266 --> 01:44:00.500
CHAIR. AND MEMBERS, I APPRECIATE

01:44:00.567 --> 01:44:02.135
THE ROBUST DISCUSSION. I'M

01:44:02.202 --> 01:44:03.570
PARTICULARLY INSPIRED BY THE

01:44:03.637 --> 01:44:05.138
ARMY OF FOLKS THAT HAVE COME TO

01:44:05.205 --> 01:44:07.140
SEE YOUR YOUR GOVERNMENT IN

01:44:07.207 --> 01:44:09.076
ACTION. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S

01:44:09.142 --> 01:44:10.344
ANYBODY LEFT IN SANTA ROSA RIGHT

01:44:10.410 --> 01:44:11.345
NOW, BUT BUT I'M GOING TO LET

01:44:11.411 --> 01:44:13.146
I'M GOING TO LET SENATOR MCGUIRE

01:44:13.213 --> 01:44:15.182
KNOW THAT 50% OF HIS DISTRICT IS

01:44:15.248 --> 01:44:18.185
ACTUALLY HERE IN THE CAPITOL.

01:44:18.251 --> 01:44:19.953
THE CONCERNS THAT ARE RAISED ARE

01:44:20.020 --> 01:44:23.256
LEGITIMATE CONCERNS. AGAIN, TO

01:44:23.323 --> 01:44:24.791
SOME MEMBER OF BENNETT'S POINT

01:44:24.858 --> 01:44:26.693
AND THE OTHER POINTS THAT ARE

01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:27.527
MADE THAT THIS IS SIMPLY

01:44:27.594 --> 01:44:28.929
ALLOWING LOCALITIES TO MAKE

01:44:28.996 --> 01:44:31.999
THEIR OWN DECISION. THIS IS

01:44:32.065 --> 01:44:33.033
SELF-DETERMINATION TO THE EXTENT

01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:35.669
THAT THAT THERE ARE ABUSES. YOU

01:44:35.736 --> 01:44:38.105
KNOW, WE ARE OPEN TO ANY SORT OF

01:44:38.171 --> 01:44:39.406
GUARDRAIL IN THE INITIATIVE,

01:44:39.473 --> 01:44:41.041
WHICH, AGAIN, HAS TO BE APPROVED

01:44:41.108 --> 01:44:43.343
BY THE VOTERS AND THEN AGAIN

01:44:43.410 --> 01:44:44.878
APPROVED BY THE LOCALITIES

01:44:44.945 --> 01:44:46.413
SHOULD THEY DECIDE TO IMPLEMENT

01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:48.148
SOME ALTERNATIVE FORM OF

01:44:48.215 --> 01:44:49.282
FINANCING CAMPAIGNS. AND WITH

01:44:49.349 --> 01:44:51.852
THAT, I URGE AND I VOTE. THANK

01:44:51.918 --> 01:44:53.353
YOU. PUBLIC FINANCING PROGRAMS

01:44:53.420 --> 01:44:55.088
ARE A PROMISING TOOL FOR

01:44:55.155 --> 01:44:56.790
EMPOWERING VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA.

01:44:56.857 --> 01:44:58.792
HOWEVER, PUBLIC FINANCING

01:44:58.859 --> 01:44:59.660
PROGRAMS ARE BANNED IN ALL

01:44:59.726 --> 01:45:00.761
JURISDICTIONS EXCEPT FOR THOSE

01:45:00.827 --> 01:45:02.663
CHARTER CITIES DUE TO THAT 37

01:45:02.729 --> 01:45:04.431
YEAR OLD BALLOT MEASURE THAT WAS

01:45:04.498 --> 01:45:05.732
LARGELY INVALIDATED BY THE

01:45:05.799 --> 01:45:07.601
COURTS. SO THIS BILL SIMPLY

01:45:07.668 --> 01:45:09.069
GIVES VOTERS THE ABILITY TO

01:45:09.136 --> 01:45:10.504
DECIDE WHETHER THEY WANT TO

01:45:10.570 --> 01:45:12.673
ALLOW PUBLIC CAMPAIGN FINANCING

01:45:12.739 --> 01:45:14.408
PROGRAMS AND SETS IMPORTANT

01:45:14.474 --> 01:45:15.809
CONDITIONS FOR ANY SUCH PROGRAMS

01:45:15.876 --> 01:45:18.378
THAT ARE CREATED. SO I WILL BE

01:45:18.445 --> 01:45:19.479
RECOMMENDING SUPPORT OF THIS

01:45:19.546 --> 01:45:22.315

01:47:44.291 --> 01:47:45.959
CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

01:47:46.026 --> 01:47:48.428
I'VE BEEN WANDERING AROUND AMONG

01:47:48.495 --> 01:47:49.596
THREE DIFFERENT COMMITTEES AT

01:47:49.663 --> 01:47:52.866
THE SAME TIME, BUT I MANAGED TO

01:47:52.933 --> 01:47:55.602
GET HERE ON TIME BEFORE YOU

01:47:55.669 --> 01:48:00.106
CLOSE. SORRY. I'M HERE TO

01:48:00.173 --> 01:48:03.610
PRESENT THE SB 48, WHICH

01:48:03.677 --> 01:48:05.745
REQUIRES COUNTY ELECTION

01:48:05.812 --> 01:48:07.848
OFFICIALS OR THE SECRETARY OF

01:48:07.914 --> 01:48:09.950
STATE TO CONTRACT WITH THE

01:48:10.016 --> 01:48:14.354
POSTAL SERVICE OR ITS LICENSEES

01:48:14.421 --> 01:48:18.024
TO OBTAIN THE USE OF US POSTAL

01:48:18.091 --> 01:48:21.528
SERVICE. CHANGE OF ADDRESS DATA

01:48:21.595 --> 01:48:24.865
TO ENSURE RESIDENCY CONFIRMATION

01:48:24.931 --> 01:48:31.304
AND VOTE FILE MAINTENANCE. I WAS

01:48:31.371 --> 01:48:31.905
NOT EXPECTING THAT THAT THIS

01:48:31.972 --> 01:48:35.275
WILL BE. PRESENTED TO YOUR

01:48:35.342 --> 01:48:38.578
COMMITTEE, BECAUSE I WAS VERY

01:48:38.645 --> 01:48:41.848
FORTUNATE THIS BILL PASSED

01:48:41.915 --> 01:48:44.217
THROUGH THE SENATE ELECTION

01:48:44.284 --> 01:48:45.719
COMMITTEE AND THE FLOOR, YOU

01:48:45.785 --> 01:48:48.688
KNOW, CONSENT CALENDAR. BUT I'M

01:48:48.755 --> 01:48:53.426
HAPPY TO PRESENT THIS TO YOU

01:48:53.493 --> 01:48:55.729
TODAY FOR FAR TOO LONG,

01:48:55.795 --> 01:48:58.698
CONFIDENCE IN OUR ELECTORAL

01:48:58.765 --> 01:49:00.500
PROCESS HAS BEEN DECLINING. ONE

01:49:00.567 --> 01:49:03.003
OF THE MAIN CONCERNS EXPRESSED

01:49:03.069 --> 01:49:06.273
BY SKEPTICS IS WHETHER OR NOT

01:49:06.339 --> 01:49:10.877
THE MAIL BALLOT SYSTEM CAN

01:49:10.944 --> 01:49:14.714
SYSTEM CAN TRULY TRUST IT.

01:49:14.781 --> 01:49:17.117
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THERE'S A

01:49:17.183 --> 01:49:19.786
LACK OF CONFIDENCE IS JUSTIFIED.

01:49:19.853 --> 01:49:22.355
WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT IT IS NOT

01:49:22.422 --> 01:49:25.558
GOOD FOR DEMOCRACY. WHEN

01:49:25.625 --> 01:49:27.761
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF VOTERS DO

01:49:27.827 --> 01:49:31.031
NOT HAVE TRUST IN OUR ELECTION

01:49:31.097 --> 01:49:34.267
PROCESSES. CURRENTLY, OUR VOTER

01:49:34.334 --> 01:49:38.204
ROLL ROLLS HAVE LARGE NUMBER OF

01:49:38.271 --> 01:49:39.973
OUTDATED REGISTRATIONS,

01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:42.575
INCLUDING INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE

01:49:42.642 --> 01:49:46.179
MOVED OUT OF STATE OR REGION OR

01:49:46.246 --> 01:49:49.482
PASSED AWAY. THIS RESULTS IN

01:49:49.549 --> 01:49:53.353
BALLOT BALLOTS BEING SENT TO

01:49:53.420 --> 01:49:57.023
UNIDENTIFIED, IDENTIFIED OR

01:49:57.090 --> 01:49:59.426
NON-EXISTENT RECIPIENTS. I HAVE

01:49:59.492 --> 01:50:03.196
RECEIVED NUMEROUS CALLS FROM

01:50:03.263 --> 01:50:06.199
DURING THE LAST 2024 ELECTION.

01:50:06.266 --> 01:50:08.601
WHAT DO I DO WITH THIS BALLOTS?

01:50:08.668 --> 01:50:10.937
I KEPT ON REPORTING IT, BUT I

01:50:11.004 --> 01:50:13.239
STILL RECEIVE. THAT IS THE

01:50:13.306 --> 01:50:16.176
REALITY RIGHT NOW. BY REQUIRING

01:50:16.242 --> 01:50:18.979
THE USE OF U.S. POSTAL SERVICE

01:50:19.045 --> 01:50:21.014
CHANGE OF ADDRESS DATA. NOW, WE

01:50:21.081 --> 01:50:24.384
CAN HELP MITIGATE THESE ISSUES

01:50:24.451 --> 01:50:28.321
AND ENSURE THAT WE HAVE CLEAN

01:50:28.388 --> 01:50:32.325
VOTER ROLLS. ACCORDING TO THE

01:50:32.392 --> 01:50:35.128
SENATE APPROPRIATIONS ANALYST,

01:50:35.195 --> 01:50:38.732
THE FISCAL IMPACT IMPACTS ARE

01:50:38.798 --> 01:50:42.035
MINOR AND ABSORBABLE. THERE IS

01:50:42.102 --> 01:50:46.740
NO OPPOSITION TO SB 48, AND IT

01:50:46.806 --> 01:50:48.975
NOW PASSED, AS I STATED

01:50:49.042 --> 01:50:50.577
UNANIMOUSLY THROUGH THE SENATE

01:50:50.643 --> 01:50:53.580
AND THROUGH THE CONSENT CALENDAR

01:50:53.646 --> 01:50:55.715
CALENDAR. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT

01:50:55.782 --> 01:50:58.118
OF THIS BILL IS REPRESENTATIVE

01:50:58.184 --> 01:51:01.121
OF THE ELECTIONS INTEGRITY

01:51:01.187 --> 01:51:02.956

MOTION, BUT YOU HAVE WE HAVE A

01:51:07.627 --> 01:51:09.162
MOTION IN A SECOND, BUT YOU HAVE

01:51:09.229 --> 01:51:10.497
TWO MINUTES. OKAY. THANK YOU. MY

01:51:10.563 --> 01:51:11.898
NAME IS COLLEEN BRITTON. I'M

01:51:11.965 --> 01:51:13.266
WITH THE ELECTION INTEGRITY

01:51:13.333 --> 01:51:15.869
PROJECT CALIFORNIA. ONE OF THE

01:51:15.935 --> 01:51:17.337
MAJOR REASONS THAT FAITH AND

01:51:17.404 --> 01:51:18.938
TRUST IN OUR CURRENT ELECTION

01:51:19.005 --> 01:51:21.207
SYSTEM IS AT AN ALL TIME LOW

01:51:21.274 --> 01:51:23.076
NATIONWIDE IS THE INDISPUTABLE

01:51:23.143 --> 01:51:24.978
EVIDENCE THAT VOTER ROLLS

01:51:25.045 --> 01:51:26.379
NATIONWIDE ARE NOTORIOUSLY

01:51:26.446 --> 01:51:28.515
POORLY MAINTAINED. IT IS

01:51:28.581 --> 01:51:30.016
ESPECIALLY CRITICAL IN

01:51:30.083 --> 01:51:31.484
CALIFORNIA, WHICH MAIL BALLOT TO

01:51:31.551 --> 01:51:33.119
EVERY ONE ON THE ACTIVE VOTER

01:51:33.186 --> 01:51:35.722
ROLLS. THOSE ROLLS MUST BE

01:51:35.789 --> 01:51:37.057
RELIABLE, AND YEAR AFTER YEAR,

01:51:37.123 --> 01:51:38.892
OUR RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THEY

01:51:38.958 --> 01:51:40.994
ARE NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BEING

01:51:41.061 --> 01:51:43.396
ACCURATE. IN 2017, THE ELECTION

01:51:43.463 --> 01:51:45.465
INTEGRITY PROJECT CALIFORNIA

01:51:45.532 --> 01:51:48.001
RETAINED JUDICIAL WATCH TO

ROLL MAINTENANCE LAWS, RESULTING

01:51:57.077 --> 01:51:58.678

UNLAWFULLY IN THAT ELECTION,

01:52:30.510 --> 01:52:32.145
ACCORDING TO OUR PRESIDENT,

01:52:32.212 --> 01:52:34.581

COMMUNITY COLLEGE TEACHER WITH

01:54:28.761 --> 01:54:29.896
CLEAN MONEY, BUT THIS WOULD BE

01:54:29.963 --> 01:54:31.931
SEPARATE 408. IT SEEMS TO ME

01:54:31.998 --> 01:54:33.866
THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE THE ERIC

01:54:33.933 --> 01:54:35.134
PROGRAM, AND A LOT OF STATES ARE

01:54:35.201 --> 01:54:37.270
FOR SOME REASON, DROPPING OUT OF

01:54:37.337 --> 01:54:39.239
IT. I THINK THAT THE POST OFFICE

01:54:39.305 --> 01:54:41.174

01:54:41.241 --> 01:54:42.141

THAT'S THE BEST PLACE TO TURN

01:54:44.377 --> 01:54:46.179
THIS OVER TO. OKAY. THANK YOU,

01:54:46.246 --> 01:54:47.213

FORWARD. I KNOW I WAS READING

01:55:06.733 --> 01:55:08.134
QUITE A BIT OF THE DATA OF

01:55:08.201 --> 01:55:09.636
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN MICHIGAN

01:55:09.702 --> 01:55:10.303
RIGHT NOW, WHERE THEY HAVE ABOUT

01:55:10.370 --> 01:55:12.672
105% MORE REGISTERED, OR 105%

01:55:12.739 --> 01:55:14.307
REGISTERED VOTERS, COMPARED TO

01:55:14.374 --> 01:55:16.776
THE POPULATION OF ELIGIBLE

01:55:16.843 --> 01:55:19.412
VOTERS. THEIR THEIR THEY'VE SEEN

01:55:19.479 --> 01:55:21.047
SOME LAWS THAT MAKE IT HARD FOR

01:55:21.114 --> 01:55:22.548
THEM TO REMOVE INACTIVE VOTERS

01:55:22.615 --> 01:55:24.350
OR PEOPLE WHO HAVE MOVED OUT OF

01:55:24.417 --> 01:55:26.019
STATE. THEY HAVE TO KEEP THEM

01:55:26.085 --> 01:55:27.520
THERE, AND THEY'VE SEEN OR GIVEN

01:55:27.587 --> 01:55:29.555
REPORTS TO THAT THEY SPEND A LOT

01:55:29.622 --> 01:55:31.691
OF MONEY DOING THAT. SO I JUST

01:55:31.758 --> 01:55:32.258
WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING

01:55:32.325 --> 01:55:33.960

01:55:34.027 --> 01:55:35.128

01:55:35.194 --> 01:55:37.930
GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU. ANY

01:55:37.997 --> 01:55:39.265
OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM

01:55:39.332 --> 01:55:41.501
COMMITTEE MEMBERS? SEEING NONE,

01:55:41.567 --> 01:55:46.472
WE HAVE A MOTION BY A SECOND BY.

01:55:46.539 --> 01:55:48.608
SENATOR. YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK

01:55:48.675 --> 01:55:54.480
YOU. I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN

01:55:54.547 --> 01:55:59.619
IMPROVE THIS EFFICIENCY FOR

01:55:59.686 --> 01:56:02.689
CLEANER, FASTER VOTER ROLL

01:56:02.755 --> 01:56:05.291
MAINTENANCE. AS OPPOSITION

01:56:05.358 --> 01:56:07.827
PERSON SAYS. BUT I WOULD BE

01:56:07.894 --> 01:56:10.430
HAPPY TO ADD THAT ANY BETTER

01:56:10.496 --> 01:56:12.298
WAY, BECAUSE I THOUGHT ABOUT

01:56:12.365 --> 01:56:14.400
THIS. THIS BILL HAS ONE FLAW.

01:56:14.467 --> 01:56:17.236
RIGHT NOW. AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE.

01:56:17.303 --> 01:56:21.441
MOST MOBILE, MOBILE PEOPLE. THEY

01:56:21.507 --> 01:56:25.078
MOVE SO FREQUENTLY. MAYBE IN 5

01:56:25.144 --> 01:56:28.848
OR 6 YEARS. I UNDERSTAND MYSELF.

01:56:28.915 --> 01:56:30.883
I THINK I MOVED ON ONCE IN TEN

01:56:30.950 --> 01:56:34.420
YEARS IN AVERAGE. ONLY THING

01:56:34.487 --> 01:56:37.623
THAT WHAT I DO IS THAT WHEN I

01:56:37.690 --> 01:56:40.660
MOVE, WHAT DO I DO FIRST? FIRST

01:56:40.727 --> 01:56:42.528
THING YOU DO IS A CHANGE OF

01:56:42.595 --> 01:56:43.429
ADDRESS BECAUSE YOU GOT TO

01:56:43.496 --> 01:56:46.232
RECEIVE YOUR MAIL. BUT WHEN YOU

01:56:46.299 --> 01:56:49.168
REQUEST, WHEN YOU THE REQUEST

01:56:49.235 --> 01:56:52.338
FROM THE REGISTRAR OF VOTERS OR

01:56:52.405 --> 01:56:55.608
VÆ VERIFYING YOUR ADDRESS WITH A

01:56:55.675 --> 01:56:59.512
POSTCARD, VERY SELDOM YOU KNOW

01:56:59.579 --> 01:57:02.014
PEOPLE WILL REPLY TO THAT, THEY

01:57:02.081 --> 01:57:04.517
IGNORE IT. THAT'S ONE OF THE

01:57:04.584 --> 01:57:05.885
THINGS THEY IGNORE THAT. SO I

01:57:05.952 --> 01:57:10.123
THINK THIS POSTAL SERVICE

01:57:10.189 --> 01:57:13.126
DATABASE UPDATE, BECAUSE OF A

01:57:13.192 --> 01:57:14.494
VOLUNTARY ORPHALI PEOPLE, WHEN

01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:17.163
THEY MOVE OUT OR MOVE IN, THEY

01:57:17.230 --> 01:57:18.965
AUTOMATICALLY REGISTER THEIR

01:57:19.031 --> 01:57:22.068
ONLY ONLY FLAW OF THIS BILL

01:57:22.135 --> 01:57:25.838
MIGHT BE THAT PERSON WOULD NOT

01:57:25.905 --> 01:57:28.608
REGISTER THE HEAVENS ADDRESS

01:57:28.674 --> 01:57:32.278
WHEN THEY PASS AWAY, BECAUSE I

01:57:32.345 --> 01:57:35.948
DO GET THE REPORTS FROM PEOPLE.

01:57:36.015 --> 01:57:37.750
HEY, MY MOTHER PASSED AWAY, BUT

01:57:37.817 --> 01:57:39.519
STILL SHE'S GETTING MAIL IN

01:57:39.585 --> 01:57:42.989
BALLOTS. SO I WONDER HOW COME RV

01:57:43.055 --> 01:57:48.494
DOES NOT HAVE A. COLLABORATION

01:57:48.561 --> 01:57:50.963
BETWEEN THE. WHAT'S THE

01:57:51.030 --> 01:57:52.832
DEPARTMENT OF WHAT IS IT

01:57:52.899 --> 01:57:53.833
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES?

01:57:53.900 --> 01:57:55.435
AND YES, THEY DO. COUNTY

01:57:55.501 --> 01:57:56.702
ELECTIONS OFFICIALS DO GET THOSE

01:57:56.769 --> 01:57:59.639
LISTS. I WOULD STRONGLY

01:57:59.705 --> 01:58:02.475
ENCOURAGE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH

01:58:02.542 --> 01:58:05.745
SERVICES OF EACH COUNTY, EACH

01:58:05.812 --> 01:58:08.948
WEEK AT LEAST TO UPDATE. SO THIS

01:58:09.015 --> 01:58:12.985
BILL IS REQUIRING TO UPDATE THE

01:58:13.052 --> 01:58:15.788
COUNTRY UPDATING ON A WEEKLY

01:58:15.855 --> 01:58:19.025
BASIS BY THE ROV WITH THE US

01:58:19.091 --> 01:58:20.893
POSTAL SERVICE. I URGE YOU, I

01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:22.662
VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SO,

01:58:22.728 --> 01:58:23.996
CALIFORNIA, I WILL ATTEST TO THE

01:58:24.063 --> 01:58:25.498
FACT THAT CALIFORNIA'S ELECTION

01:58:25.565 --> 01:58:27.800
OFFICIALS WORK DILIGENTLY TO

01:58:27.867 --> 01:58:28.868
MAINTAIN VOTER REGISTRATION

01:58:28.935 --> 01:58:30.570
LISTS IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH

01:58:30.636 --> 01:58:32.038
FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS, BUT

01:58:32.104 --> 01:58:33.873
VOTER LIST MAINTENANCE CAN BE

01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:35.241
CHALLENGING, IN PART BECAUSE FEW

01:58:35.308 --> 01:58:37.109
VOTERS NOTIFY THEIR ELECTIONS

01:58:37.176 --> 01:58:39.178
OFFICIAL WHEN THEY MOVE. SO I

01:58:39.245 --> 01:58:40.613
SUPPORT EFFORTS TO EXAMINE OTHER

01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:42.482
TOOLS TO HELP WITH VOTER ROLLS

01:58:42.548 --> 01:58:44.383
UP TO DATE, WHICH IS WHY I HAVE

01:58:44.450 --> 01:58:46.085
AUTHORED LEGISLATION THAT SOUGHT

01:58:46.152 --> 01:58:47.553
TO UPDATE THE STATE'S TOOLBOX

01:58:47.620 --> 01:58:49.055
FOR VOTER FILE MAINTENANCE. BUT

01:58:49.121 --> 01:58:50.623
WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THOSE

01:58:50.690 --> 01:58:51.824
ADDITIONAL TOOLS ALSO COME WITH

01:58:51.891 --> 01:58:53.693
ADDITIONAL COSTS. AND COUNTY

01:58:53.759 --> 01:58:54.760
ELECTIONS BUDGETS ARE STRETCHED

01:58:54.827 --> 01:58:56.362
THIN AS IT IS. IN FACT, THIS

01:58:56.429 --> 01:58:58.431
BILL IS EXPECTED TO COST

01:58:58.498 --> 01:58:59.365
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS PER ELECTION

01:58:59.432 --> 01:59:01.167
CYCLE TO IMPLEMENT. SO I WILL

01:59:01.234 --> 01:59:03.069
SUPPORT THIS BILL. BUT I ALSO

01:59:03.135 --> 01:59:04.403
WANT TO UNDERSCORE THE

01:59:04.470 --> 01:59:05.238
IMPORTANCE OF MAKING SURE THAT

01:59:05.304 --> 01:59:06.906
COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICIALS HAVE

01:59:06.973 --> 01:59:09.475
THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO

01:59:09.542 --> 01:59:11.677
IMPLEMENT THIS BILL. SO, MADAM
