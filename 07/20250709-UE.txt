00:43:38.983 --> 00:43:42.219
ISSUE FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS.

00:43:42.286 --> 00:43:44.021
AS SOME BACKGROUND, METHANE IS A

00:43:44.088 --> 00:43:45.389
SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS

00:43:45.456 --> 00:43:47.624
THAT IS 87 TIMES MORE POTENT

00:43:47.691 --> 00:43:49.994
THAN CARBON DIOXIDE IN THE SHORT

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:52.296
TERM. CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO BE

00:43:52.363 --> 00:43:54.398
A LEADER ON REDUCING METHANE

00:43:54.465 --> 00:43:55.799
EMISSIONS. OVER THE PAST YEARS,

00:43:55.866 --> 00:43:57.368
THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD HAS

00:43:57.434 --> 00:43:59.837
ADOPTED A STRONG OIL AND GAS

00:43:59.903 --> 00:44:01.605

LEAKS WHEN MOVING NATURAL GAS

00:44:15.319 --> 00:44:17.121
WITHIN OUR STATE'S GAS PIPELINE

00:44:17.187 --> 00:44:19.256
SYSTEM. THIS BILL LOOKS AT

00:44:19.323 --> 00:44:20.691
UPSTREAM EMISSIONS IN A COST

00:44:20.758 --> 00:44:22.793
EFFECTIVE MANNER. CALIFORNIA

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:24.595
CURRENTLY IMPORTS ABOUT 90% OF

00:44:24.661 --> 00:44:27.164
ITS NATURAL GAS, MAINLY FROM

00:44:27.231 --> 00:44:29.600
COLORADO, NEW MEXICO, TEXAS AND

00:44:29.666 --> 00:44:31.168
CANADA. ON THE PETROLEUM SIDE,

00:44:31.235 --> 00:44:33.704
WE IMPORT APPROXIMATELY 50% OF

00:44:33.771 --> 00:44:36.507
OUR OIL FROM IRAQ, SAUDI ARABIA,

00:44:36.573 --> 00:44:38.976
ECUADOR, BRAZIL, GUYANA AND

00:44:39.043 --> 00:44:40.844
CANADA. WE ARE STILL AMONGST THE

00:44:40.911 --> 00:44:42.312
LARGEST USERS OF FOSSIL

00:44:42.379 --> 00:44:45.182
PETROLEUM AND GAS IN THE WORLD.

00:44:45.249 --> 00:44:46.550
THIS BILL BEFORE US WILL MOVE

00:44:46.617 --> 00:44:48.052

AND OTHER AGENCIES TO PRIORITIZE

00:44:50.254 --> 00:44:52.022
STRATEGIES TO REDUCE METHANE

00:44:52.089 --> 00:44:53.657
EMISSIONS, INCLUDING EMISSIONS

00:44:53.724 --> 00:44:55.325
FROM IMPORTED PETROLEUM AND

00:44:55.392 --> 00:44:57.227
NATURAL GAS. THE BILL EMPOWERS

00:44:57.294 --> 00:44:59.596
THE PUC AND AIR RESOURCES BOARD

00:44:59.663 --> 00:45:01.331

PROTOCOLS SUCH AS THE OIL AND

00:45:06.437 --> 00:45:08.472

ORDER TO REDUCE EMISSIONS AND

00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:15.446
SEND MARKET SIGNALS. THIS BILL

00:45:15.512 --> 00:45:17.247
WILL ENCOURAGE NATURAL GAS

00:45:17.314 --> 00:45:18.649
PROCUREMENT TO SHIFT TO LOW

00:45:18.715 --> 00:45:19.983

FEASIBLE, COST EFFECTIVE AND IN

00:45:21.952 --> 00:45:23.687
THE BEST INTEREST OF RATEPAYERS.

00:45:23.754 --> 00:45:25.055
THIS IS IMPORTANT, AS THE

00:45:25.122 --> 00:45:26.457
PREVIOUS FEDERAL

00:45:26.523 --> 00:45:27.291
ADMINISTRATION'S METHANE

00:45:27.357 --> 00:45:29.793
EMISSIONS REDUCTION PROGRAM WAS

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:32.362
RECENTLY REPEALED BY THE RECENT

00:45:32.429 --> 00:45:34.031
CONGRESSIONAL BILL. INDUSTRY

00:45:34.098 --> 00:45:36.633
ACTORS WERE ACTUALLY EMBRACING

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:38.135
TECHNOLOGIES TO REDUCE LEAKED

00:45:38.202 --> 00:45:39.837
METHANE BECAUSE IT SAVED THEM

00:45:39.903 --> 00:45:40.904
MONEY FROM WASTING THEIR OWN

00:45:40.971 --> 00:45:43.107

COMPARED TO 2020 LEVELS,

00:45:51.048 --> 00:45:53.217
CONTINUES TO GO UNMET. THIS BILL

00:45:53.283 --> 00:45:54.585
WILL SHOW THAT CALIFORNIA CAN

00:45:54.651 --> 00:45:56.386
CONTINUE TO TAKE STEPS TO BE A

00:45:56.453 --> 00:45:58.155

CAPTURE TECHNOLOGIES ARE A

00:47:48.799 --> 00:47:51.201
NECESSARY AND IMPORTANT PART OF

00:47:51.268 --> 00:47:53.337
CALIFORNIA'S STRATEGY TO ACHIEVE

00:47:53.403 --> 00:47:55.038
OUR CLIMATE GOALS. RECOGNIZING

00:47:55.105 --> 00:47:57.741

THE STATE. AS PART OF THAT, AND

00:48:17.661 --> 00:48:20.197
IN 2022, CALIFORNIA DECIDED TO

NEW CARBON DIOXIDE PIPELINES

00:48:24.268 --> 00:48:25.369
BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:48:25.435 --> 00:48:27.971
WAS IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING

00:48:28.038 --> 00:48:30.240
FEDERAL REGULATIONS. THE STATE

00:48:30.307 --> 00:48:31.275
ESTABLISHED A MORATORIUM THAT

00:48:31.341 --> 00:48:33.010
WAS TO REMAIN IN PLACE UNTIL THE

00:48:34.878 --> 00:48:37.381
IN JANUARY OF 2025. A DRAFT OF

00:48:37.447 --> 00:48:39.216

00:48:41.118 --> 00:48:42.819
ADMINISTRATION. UNFORTUNATELY,

00:48:42.886 --> 00:48:43.920
THREE DAYS LATER, DONALD TRUMP

00:48:43.987 --> 00:48:45.656
WAS INAUGURATED AND THAT

00:48:45.722 --> 00:48:48.091
REGULATORY PROCESS GROUND TO A

00:48:48.158 --> 00:48:49.993
HALT. SO WHAT COMES NEXT FROM

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:51.528
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS

00:48:51.595 --> 00:48:52.496
UNCERTAIN. BUT WHAT WE KNOW IS

00:48:52.562 --> 00:48:53.997
THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

00:48:54.064 --> 00:48:55.532
CALIFORNIA TO TAKE OUR DESTINY

00:48:55.599 --> 00:48:59.036
IN OUR OWN HANDS. THIS BILL, SB

00:48:59.102 --> 00:49:00.771
614, DIRECTS THE FIRE MARSHAL TO

00:49:00.837 --> 00:49:03.707
BUILD UPON THE DRAFT FEDERAL

00:49:03.774 --> 00:49:06.209
GUIDELINES AND ALLOWS THE STATE

00:49:06.276 --> 00:49:08.812
TO LIFT OUR MORATORIUM IN A

00:49:08.879 --> 00:49:11.848
RESPONSIBLE AND SAFE WAY. WITH

00:49:11.915 --> 00:49:14.084
THAT, I AM PLEASED TO BE JOINED

00:49:14.151 --> 00:49:16.720

CHAIRMAN, MEMBER SCOTT, ON

00:49:23.193 --> 00:49:25.128
BEHALF OF THE CARBON CAPTURE

00:49:25.195 --> 00:49:26.430
SOLUTIONS COALITION, AS WELL AS

00:49:26.496 --> 00:49:28.532
THE CALIFORNIA STATE PIPE TRADES

00:49:28.598 --> 00:49:29.499
COUNCIL. I WAS VERY INVOLVED IN

00:49:29.566 --> 00:49:31.401
ALL THE NEGOTIATIONS AROUND SB

00:49:31.468 --> 00:49:32.869
905, WHICH WAS A BUDGET TRAILER

00:49:32.936 --> 00:49:36.073
BILL. EVERYTHING THE AUTHOR

00:49:36.139 --> 00:49:39.343
STATED IS EXACTLY ON POINT. I

00:49:39.409 --> 00:49:41.111
WILL SAY THAT THAT BILL AND

00:49:41.178 --> 00:49:44.481
THOSE NEGOTIATIONS ANTICIPATED A

00:49:44.548 --> 00:49:47.718
POTENTIAL PROBLEMS WITH PHMSA

00:49:47.784 --> 00:49:49.052
ISSUING THE GUIDELINES IN THE

00:49:49.119 --> 00:49:51.555
TIME FRAME NEEDED. AND SO IT HAD

00:49:51.621 --> 00:49:53.857
A COMPONENT THAT HAD THE STATE

00:49:53.924 --> 00:49:55.425
FIRE MARSHAL PROVIDE A REPORT TO

00:49:55.492 --> 00:49:58.695
THE LEGISLATURE BY FEBRUARY 23RD

00:49:58.762 --> 00:50:01.465
OF 2023, STATING THEIR ABILITY

00:50:01.531 --> 00:50:04.167
AND CAPACITY TO PROMULGATE

00:50:04.234 --> 00:50:05.602
SAFETY REGULATIONS FOR PIPELINES

00:50:05.669 --> 00:50:08.171
IN THE EVENT THAT WE NEEDED TO

00:50:08.238 --> 00:50:10.474
DO THAT. UNFORTUNATELY, WE FIND

00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:12.409
OURSELVES IN THAT SITUATION. THE

00:50:12.476 --> 00:50:13.577
MONEY THAT THE BIDEN

00:50:13.643 --> 00:50:14.745
ADMINISTRATION SET ASIDE FOR

00:50:14.811 --> 00:50:18.148
CARBON CAPTURE IS EVAPORATING

00:50:18.215 --> 00:50:19.649
QUICKLY. THERE WAS A TEN YEAR

00:50:19.716 --> 00:50:21.818
MORATORIUM. 905 HAD A TEN YEAR

00:50:21.885 --> 00:50:23.653
MORATORIUM. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:24.821
PROJECTS AND PILOT PROJECTS IN

00:50:24.888 --> 00:50:26.456
THE PIPELINE AND LITERALLY IN

00:50:26.523 --> 00:50:28.024
THE PIPELINE. AND WITHOUT THIS

00:50:28.091 --> 00:50:30.060
FIX, NONE OF THEM WILL WILL COME

00:50:30.127 --> 00:50:32.062
TO FRUITION. SO THIS IS SUPER

00:50:32.129 --> 00:50:35.432
URGENT THAT WE GET THIS DONE.

00:50:35.499 --> 00:50:36.666
AND WE WOULD URGE AND I VOTE.

00:50:36.733 --> 00:50:38.668
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE

00:50:38.735 --> 00:50:41.238

00:51:02.926 --> 00:51:04.594
THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. ANY

00:51:04.661 --> 00:51:08.999

00:51:09.065 --> 00:51:11.134
GREAT. WE'LL KEEP THAT ONE. AND

00:51:11.201 --> 00:51:13.203
WE'LL TAKE A VOTE WHEN WE HAVE A

00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:14.438

PARTNERSHIP AND LEADERSHIP IN

00:51:29.219 --> 00:51:32.355
THIS CRITICAL ISSUE. I REALLY

00:51:32.422 --> 00:51:33.623
APPRECIATE WHEN OUR TWO HOUSES

00:51:33.690 --> 00:51:35.625

00:51:35.692 --> 00:51:38.695
FORGE SOLUTIONS IN CONFRONTING

00:51:38.762 --> 00:51:40.063
SOME OF OUR STATE'S MOST URGENT

00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:41.798

00:51:41.865 --> 00:51:43.166

00:56:59.249 --> 00:57:00.683
PROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS,

00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:03.119
AND I WANT TO THANK THE TEAM FOR

00:57:03.186 --> 00:57:05.822
THEIR ENGAGEMENT ON THIS BILL.

00:57:05.889 --> 00:57:07.423
SB 332 IS ABOUT PUTTING

00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:09.225
PRIORITIES AND PRIORITIZING

00:57:09.292 --> 00:57:11.027
RATEPAYERS FOR CORPORATIONS OVER

00:57:11.094 --> 00:57:13.163
CORPORATIONS. SORRY, CALIFORNIA

00:57:13.229 --> 00:57:15.031
IOU INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY

00:57:15.098 --> 00:57:16.766
ELECTRICITY RATES ARE MORE THAN

00:57:16.833 --> 00:57:18.902
50% HIGHER THAN RATES CHARGED BY

00:57:18.968 --> 00:57:21.571
PUBLIC OWNED UTILITIES. UNDER

00:57:21.638 --> 00:57:23.039
OUR CURRENT FRAMEWORK, CUSTOMERS

00:57:23.106 --> 00:57:25.608
PAY FOR ALL THE COSTS OF

00:57:25.675 --> 00:57:26.910
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS, AND

00:57:26.976 --> 00:57:28.945
THEN THEY PAY AN AVERAGE 10% TO

00:57:29.012 --> 00:57:31.181
THE UTILITY SO THEY CAN PROFIT.

00:57:31.247 --> 00:57:33.383
THIS DYNAMIC INCENTIVIZES

00:57:33.449 --> 00:57:35.185
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES TO MAKE

00:57:35.251 --> 00:57:36.553
THEIR PROJECTS AS EXPENSIVE AS

00:57:36.619 --> 00:57:39.989
POSSIBLE. SB 32 EXAMINES AND

00:57:40.056 --> 00:57:42.058
ADDRESSES THE ISSUES THAT ARISE

00:57:42.125 --> 00:57:42.625
FROM THE INHERENTLY FLAWED

00:57:42.692 --> 00:57:43.793
SYSTEM, TYING EXECUTIVE

METRICS, STUDYING WHETHER OR NOT

00:57:47.564 --> 00:57:49.465
THE IOU STRUCTURE IS THE BEST

00:57:49.532 --> 00:57:49.899
FORM OF UTILITY FOR

00:57:49.966 --> 00:57:50.867
CALIFORNIANS. INCREASING THE

00:57:50.934 --> 00:57:52.735
TRANSPARENCY OF UTILITY

00:57:52.802 --> 00:57:54.237
DISCONNECTIONS WITH UTILITIES

00:57:54.304 --> 00:57:56.339
PASSING ON COSTS TO RATEPAYERS

00:57:56.406 --> 00:57:57.273
UNABATED. IT IS TIME FOR THE

00:57:57.340 --> 00:58:00.310
STATE TO MAKE CHANGES THAT SHIFT

00:58:00.376 --> 00:58:01.778
THE BALANCE OF POWER TOWARD THE

00:58:01.845 --> 00:58:05.148
PEOPLE HERE TO TESTIFY IN

00:58:05.215 --> 00:58:06.816
SUPPORT OF SB 332 IS MARIA

00:58:06.883 --> 00:58:09.786
STAMOS, POLICY DIRECTOR AT THE

AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE.

00:58:16.826 --> 00:58:18.394
I'M HERE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT

00:58:18.461 --> 00:58:21.264
OF SB 3032. FOR DECADES,

00:58:21.331 --> 00:58:22.398
CALIFORNIA'S INVESTOR OWNED

00:58:22.465 --> 00:58:23.867
UTILITIES HAVE OPERATED WITH A

00:58:23.933 --> 00:58:25.268
PRIMARY OBLIGATION TO MAXIMIZE

00:58:25.335 --> 00:58:27.203
SHAREHOLDER RETURNS. MEANWHILE,

00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:28.738
OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE EXPERIENCED

00:58:28.805 --> 00:58:30.406
SOME OF THE LARGEST UTILITY

00:58:30.473 --> 00:58:31.841
CAUSED DEVASTATING WILDFIRES IN

00:58:31.908 --> 00:58:33.877
THE NATION AND ALSO FACE THE

00:58:33.943 --> 00:58:35.345
HIGHEST ELECTRICITY RATES IN THE

00:58:35.411 --> 00:58:37.480
CONTINENTAL US. WE'RE STUCK IN A

00:58:37.547 --> 00:58:38.982
CYCLE WHERE CORPORATE NEGLECT

00:58:39.048 --> 00:58:42.051
LEADS TO UNNATURAL DISASTER, AND

00:58:42.118 --> 00:58:43.620
RATEPAYERS ARE ASKED TO FOOT THE

00:58:43.686 --> 00:58:44.721
BILL. TODAY, WITH S¼ PROBABLE

00:58:44.787 --> 00:58:46.189
CONNECTION TO THE EATON FIRE,

00:58:46.256 --> 00:58:47.390
WE'RE FACING THIS PATTERN YET

00:58:47.457 --> 00:58:49.392
AGAIN. SB 332 OFFERS A

00:58:49.459 --> 00:58:51.227
RESPONSIBLE PATH FORWARD. IT

00:58:51.294 --> 00:58:52.262
SIMPLY DIRECTS THE STATE TO

00:58:52.328 --> 00:58:54.664
CONDUCT A PUBLIC STUDY, JUST A

00:58:54.731 --> 00:58:56.499
STUDY TO ASSESS WHICH OWNERSHIP

00:58:56.566 --> 00:58:58.201
AND FINANCE MODELS, IF ANY,

00:58:58.268 --> 00:58:59.535
COULD DELIVER SAFER, MORE

00:58:59.602 --> 00:59:01.304
AFFORDABLE ENERGY. IN ADDITION

00:59:01.371 --> 00:59:03.139
TO THE STUDY, THE BILL INCLUDES

00:59:03.206 --> 00:59:05.241
TWO COMMON SENSE REFORMS LINKING

00:59:05.308 --> 00:59:07.410
EXECUTIVE PAY IN PART TO BILL

00:59:07.477 --> 00:59:08.177
AFFORDABILITY, NOT JUST

00:59:08.244 --> 00:59:09.812
SHAREHOLDER RETURNS, AND TO

00:59:09.879 --> 00:59:11.648
REQUIRE BETTER DATA ON UTILITY

00:59:11.714 --> 00:59:13.182
SHUTOFFS TO INFORM FUTURE

00:59:13.249 --> 00:59:16.452
AFFORDABILITY DECISIONS. IF

00:59:16.519 --> 00:59:17.587
CALIFORNIA HAD THIS INFORMATION

00:59:17.654 --> 00:59:19.923
IN 2019 WHEN PGE WENT BANKRUPT,

00:59:19.989 --> 00:59:21.457
WE WOULD HAVE HAD BETTER OPTIONS

00:59:21.524 --> 00:59:23.426
AND WE NEED THAT DATA NOW TO

00:59:23.493 --> 00:59:24.827
MAKE SMARTER DECISIONS MOVING

00:59:24.894 --> 00:59:25.795
FORWARD. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE

00:59:25.862 --> 00:59:28.665
THAT SB 332 ENSURES LABOR IS

00:59:28.731 --> 00:59:30.033
PROTECTED. THE STUDY WOULD BE

00:59:30.099 --> 00:59:31.000
CONDUCTED WITH A UNIVERSITY

00:59:31.067 --> 00:59:32.936
LABOR CENTER TO ASSESS HOW ANY

00:59:33.002 --> 00:59:34.270
POTENTIAL TRANSITION CAN

00:59:34.337 --> 00:59:35.738
SAFEGUARD AND EVEN IMPROVE

00:59:35.805 --> 00:59:37.240
PENSIONS, SALARIES, AND UNION

00:59:37.307 --> 00:59:39.075
JOBS. A PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE

00:59:39.142 --> 00:59:40.176
BILL INCLUDED A BEST VALUE

WE APPRECIATE, NUMBER ONE. I'D

01:04:11.547 --> 01:04:13.015
JUST LIKE TO EXPRESS A LOT OF

01:04:13.082 --> 01:04:14.517

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:22.225
THE HOLIDAY, SOME REALLY GOOD

01:04:22.291 --> 01:04:24.126
ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED OVERALL.

01:04:24.193 --> 01:04:25.127
WE APPRECIATE THAT THE

01:04:25.194 --> 01:04:26.362
AMENDMENTS HAVE NARROWED THE

01:04:26.429 --> 01:04:29.599
SCOPE OF SB 332, BUT EVEN IN ITS

01:04:29.665 --> 01:04:31.701
AMENDED FORM, WE VIEW IT AS A

01:04:31.767 --> 01:04:33.202
COSTLY AND DESTABILIZING

01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:34.770

01:04:34.837 --> 01:04:36.372

IU TRANSITION FEASIBILITY STUDY

01:04:47.950 --> 01:04:49.352
INJECTS LONG TERM UNCERTAINTY

01:04:49.418 --> 01:04:51.287
THAT COULD DISCOURAGE INVESTMENT

01:04:51.354 --> 01:04:52.955
IN CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE,

01:04:53.022 --> 01:04:54.757
RAISE THE COST OF CAPITAL, AND

01:04:54.824 --> 01:04:56.525
SLOW PROGRESS ON DECARBONIZATION

01:04:56.592 --> 01:04:57.960
AND RELIABILITY IMPROVEMENTS.

01:04:58.027 --> 01:05:00.129
THE RESULT IS HIGHER LONG TERM

01:05:00.196 --> 01:05:02.298
COSTS FOR RATEPAYERS WHO BEAR

01:05:02.365 --> 01:05:03.399
THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE

01:05:03.466 --> 01:05:05.134
REGULATORY UNPREDICTABILITY THAT

01:05:05.201 --> 01:05:08.337
SB 332 INTRODUCES. NOW, I HEARD

01:05:08.404 --> 01:05:10.039
YOU TALK ABOUT THE STUDY

01:05:10.106 --> 01:05:10.973
FRAMEWORK, AND THIS IS JUST A

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:12.508
STUDY, AND IT'S A STUDY, BUT

01:05:12.575 --> 01:05:14.477
IT'S NOT A NEUTRAL STUDY, RIGHT?

01:05:14.543 --> 01:05:15.778
IT'S ONE THAT PUTS THE THUMB ON

01:05:15.845 --> 01:05:17.446
THE SCALE. IT ASSUMES THAT

01:05:17.513 --> 01:05:19.582
PUBLIC OR NONPROFIT OWNERSHIP OF

01:05:19.649 --> 01:05:20.983
UTILITY, THAT PUBLIC OR

01:05:21.050 --> 01:05:22.351
NONPROFIT OWNERSHIP OF UTILITIES

01:05:22.418 --> 01:05:24.320
IS THE PREFERRED SOLUTION. AND

01:05:24.387 --> 01:05:26.122
IT YOU KNOW, IT DICTATES

01:05:26.188 --> 01:05:27.657
SPECIFIC RESEARCH INSTITUTES

01:05:27.723 --> 01:05:30.026
THAT WILL BE USED AT A TIME WHEN

01:05:30.092 --> 01:05:31.394
CALIFORNIANS ARE STRUGGLING WITH

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:32.528
AFFORDABILITY. TAXPAYERS SHOULD

01:05:32.595 --> 01:05:35.731
NOT BE FUNDING $5 MILLION POLICY

01:05:35.798 --> 01:05:37.199
EXPERIMENTS THAT ASSUME THE

01:05:37.266 --> 01:05:39.135
PROBLEM. AND THE ANSWER BEFORE

01:05:39.201 --> 01:05:41.170
THE ANALYSIS EVEN BEGINS. THE

01:05:41.237 --> 01:05:43.072
BILL CREATES A BIASED PROCESS

01:05:43.139 --> 01:05:44.407
THAT UNDERMINES TRUST AND

01:05:44.473 --> 01:05:46.909
OBJECTIVE POLICY MAKING. NOW

LINKING EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

01:05:51.714 --> 01:05:53.883
CREATES PERVERSE INCENTIVES, FOR

01:05:53.949 --> 01:05:54.850
EXAMPLE, BY LINKING EXECUTIVE

01:05:54.917 --> 01:05:57.086
PAY TO DISCONNECTION RATES THAT

01:05:57.153 --> 01:05:59.255
COULD PRESSURE UTILITIES TO

01:05:59.322 --> 01:06:00.990
AVOID SERVICE TERMINATIONS

01:06:01.057 --> 01:06:02.792
ALTOGETHER, EVEN FOR CHRONIC

01:06:02.858 --> 01:06:04.160
NONPAYMENT. THAT UNDERMINES

01:06:04.226 --> 01:06:06.028
BASIC BILL COLLECTING AND

01:06:06.095 --> 01:06:08.064
ENCOURAGES NONCOMPLIANCE.

01:06:08.130 --> 01:06:09.265
SUPPRESSING DISCONNECTIONS MAY

01:06:09.332 --> 01:06:11.067
LEAD TO A RISE IN UNCOLLECTIBLE

01:06:11.133 --> 01:06:12.335
DEBT, WHICH ULTIMATELY GETS

01:06:12.401 --> 01:06:13.969

AFTER AMENDMENTS, BUT IT STILL

01:06:22.345 --> 01:06:23.312
THREATENS RATEPAYER

01:06:23.379 --> 01:06:24.447
AFFORDABILITY. AND WE HAVE SOME

01:06:24.513 --> 01:06:25.414

01:07:26.041 --> 01:07:27.777
PRESUPPOSES THE OUTCOMES OF THE

01:07:27.843 --> 01:07:29.745
STUDY. SO WHEN I READ THE BILL,

01:07:29.812 --> 01:07:31.180
IT WAS SORT OF LIKE, WELL, THAT

01:07:31.247 --> 01:07:33.215
MIGHT BE THE CASE, BUT I DON'T

01:07:33.282 --> 01:07:34.950
KNOW THAT I AGREE WITH THIS, AND

01:07:35.017 --> 01:07:36.285
IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE CODIFYING IN

01:07:36.352 --> 01:07:37.820
THE LAW A BUNCH OF CONCLUSIONS

01:07:37.887 --> 01:07:39.588
THAT ARE SHOULD BE THE OUTCOME

01:07:39.655 --> 01:07:41.090
OF A NEUTRAL STUDY. SO I DO

01:07:41.157 --> 01:07:42.758
THINK IT IS A FAIR QUESTION, YOU

01:07:42.825 --> 01:07:44.660
KNOW, DID WE GET IT RIGHT WHEN

01:07:44.727 --> 01:07:47.029
WE WENT TO A MODEL OF INVESTOR

01:07:47.096 --> 01:07:48.230
OWNED UTILITIES THAT WERE

01:07:48.297 --> 01:07:51.167
REGULATED OVER PUBLICLY OWNED

01:07:51.233 --> 01:07:53.669
UTILITIES? RIGHT. AND, YOU KNOW,

01:07:53.736 --> 01:07:55.104
THE QUESTION I HAVE IS WHERE ARE

01:07:55.171 --> 01:07:58.073
WE GOING TO COME UP WITH THE I

01:07:58.140 --> 01:07:59.041
DON'T KNOW, IS IT 40 BILLION,

01:07:59.108 --> 01:08:00.042
$60 BILLION TO BUY OUT

01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:01.310
UTILITIES? BUT BEFORE WE GO

01:08:01.377 --> 01:08:03.245
THERE, I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE

01:08:03.312 --> 01:08:04.413
BEFORE WE WERE EVER TO GO THERE,

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:06.682
WE NEED TO HAVE, I THINK, A

01:08:06.749 --> 01:08:08.417
FAIRLY NEUTRAL STUDY THAT

01:08:08.484 --> 01:08:11.287
ACTUALLY DOESN'T ASSUME THAT

01:08:11.353 --> 01:08:13.189
THAT'S THE BEST OUTCOME FOR

01:08:13.255 --> 01:08:14.723
RATEPAYERS AND FOR THE PUBLIC.

01:08:14.790 --> 01:08:17.092
SO, YOU KNOW, WHEN I LOOK AT

01:08:17.159 --> 01:08:18.661
THIS, YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST PAST

01:08:18.727 --> 01:08:19.462
AND PRESENT EXPERIENCE

01:08:19.528 --> 01:08:20.095
DEMONSTRATES THAT IOUS

01:08:20.162 --> 01:08:20.963
PRIORITIZE PROFITS OVER THE

01:08:21.030 --> 01:08:22.198
SAFETY AND WELL-BEING OF

01:08:22.264 --> 01:08:22.932
RATEPAYERS AND RESIDENTS OF

01:08:22.998 --> 01:08:25.067
CALIFORNIA. I DON'T KNOW THAT I

01:08:25.134 --> 01:08:25.701
NECESSARILY AGREE WITH THAT. I

01:08:25.768 --> 01:08:27.570
THINK MAYBE THE STRUCTURE

01:08:27.636 --> 01:08:28.971
RESULTS IN HIGH RATES, BUT, YOU

01:08:29.038 --> 01:08:30.840
KNOW, STATEMENTS LIKE THAT IN A

01:08:30.906 --> 01:08:33.142
IN A BILL TO ME GIVE ME A LOT OF

01:08:33.209 --> 01:08:35.044
HEARTBURN. AND THEY'D HAVE TO BE

01:08:35.110 --> 01:08:37.246
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE SOMETHING

01:08:37.313 --> 01:08:37.813
THAT'S MORE NEUTRAL WHEN IT

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:39.915
COMES BACK TO THE FLOOR. I DO

01:08:39.982 --> 01:08:41.116
HAVE SOME NERVOUSNESS ABOUT THE

01:08:41.183 --> 01:08:43.652
SIGNAL THIS SENDS, YOU KNOW, AT

01:08:43.719 --> 01:08:46.121
A TIME WHEN WE'VE GOT FINANCIAL

01:08:46.188 --> 01:08:47.990
MARKETS. I MEAN, WE DO NEED TO

01:08:48.057 --> 01:08:50.292
BE CAREFUL ABOUT DOING THINGS

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:52.695
THAT UNLESS WE'RE REALLY, YOU

01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:55.364
KNOW, ABOUT DOING THINGS THAT

01:08:55.431 --> 01:08:57.433
DESTABILIZE THE COST OF CAPITAL

01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:58.467
FOR UTILITIES, BECAUSE THAT

01:08:58.534 --> 01:09:00.669
ACTUALLY HAS REAL IMPACTS, TOO.

01:09:00.736 --> 01:09:03.873
SO THAT'S THE FIRST COMMENT IS

01:09:03.939 --> 01:09:06.275
SORT OF JUST THE THIS DOES SEEM

01:09:06.342 --> 01:09:08.644
LIKE IT PUTS THE THUMB ON THE

01:09:08.711 --> 01:09:10.045
SCALES. IT'S CONCLUDING THE

01:09:10.112 --> 01:09:10.679
THINGS THAT A STUDY SHOULD BE

01:09:10.746 --> 01:09:13.349
SEEKING THE ANSWERS OF. AND THEN

01:09:13.415 --> 01:09:15.417
THE SECOND PART WAS JUST

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:17.586
QUESTIONS ABOUT IS THE EXECUTIVE

01:09:17.653 --> 01:09:19.522
COMPENSATION LANGUAGE STILL IN

01:09:19.588 --> 01:09:22.458
THE BILL, OR IS THAT OUT OF THE

01:09:22.525 --> 01:09:27.696
BILL NOW? IT IS IN THE BILL.

01:09:27.763 --> 01:09:29.498
THERE'S NOTHING THERE. SO I

01:09:29.565 --> 01:09:31.467
GUESS THE QUESTION IS, I THOUGHT

01:09:31.534 --> 01:09:32.268
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION WAS

01:09:32.334 --> 01:09:33.802
ALREADY TIED TO SAFETY

01:09:33.869 --> 01:09:36.038
PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES. AND AS

01:09:36.105 --> 01:09:39.475
REVIEWED BY. AS PART OF THE

01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:40.543
SAFETY CERTIFICATION PROCESS. SO

01:09:40.609 --> 01:09:43.445
HOW WOULD WHAT'S IN THE BILL BE

01:09:43.512 --> 01:09:45.748
DIFFERENT. YEAH. SO IT HAS BEEN

01:09:45.814 --> 01:09:47.449
ADJUSTED ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT.

01:09:47.516 --> 01:09:49.485
SO IT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT WE

01:09:49.552 --> 01:09:51.787
ORIGINALLY HAD. IT AMENDS THE

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:53.322
BILL TO BASICALLY INCLUDE

01:09:53.389 --> 01:09:54.256
RATEPAYER AFFORDABILITY

01:09:54.323 --> 01:09:56.058
ALONGSIDE SAFETY AS METRICS FOR

01:09:56.125 --> 01:09:57.126
ASSESSING EXECUTIVE

01:09:57.192 --> 01:09:58.260
COMPENSATION. AND THERE IS A

01:09:58.327 --> 01:10:00.062
COMPONENT THAT IN 2019 IT WAS

01:10:00.129 --> 01:10:02.164
DONE AS YOU STATED, BUT IT

01:10:02.231 --> 01:10:03.899
DEFINES RIGHT NOW RATEPAYER

01:10:03.966 --> 01:10:05.801
AFFORDABILITY AS A REVIEW OF

01:10:05.868 --> 01:10:07.469
DATA RELATED TO CUSTOMER

01:10:07.536 --> 01:10:10.406
DISCONNECTIONS AND

01:10:10.472 --> 01:10:10.906
UNCOLLECTIBLES THAT THE

01:10:10.973 --> 01:10:11.840
COMMISSION ALREADY COLLECTS

01:10:11.907 --> 01:10:14.510
PURSUANT TO SECTION 718 AND NINE

01:10:14.577 --> 01:10:15.544
10.5 AND PROCEEDINGS

01:10:15.611 --> 01:10:16.779
IMPLEMENTING THOSE SECTIONS. SO

01:10:16.845 --> 01:10:18.681
WHAT WE ALSO REQUIRE IS

01:10:18.747 --> 01:10:20.149
COMPENSATION DOCUMENTATION TO

01:10:20.215 --> 01:10:21.951
INCLUDE SPECIFIED DOLLAR

01:10:22.017 --> 01:10:25.154
AMOUNTS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, AND

01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:28.157
AS FAR AS THE FEASIBILITY STUDY,

01:10:28.223 --> 01:10:30.092
THERE ARE ACTUALLY SEVERAL

01:10:30.159 --> 01:10:33.062
PHASES. AND PHASE ONE IS THE

01:10:33.128 --> 01:10:34.897
ROUGH FRAMEWORK OF WHAT THEY'RE

01:10:34.964 --> 01:10:36.765
GOING TO BE REVIEWING AND HOW.

01:10:36.832 --> 01:10:40.336
BUT THEN ALSO GIVE ME TWO

01:10:40.402 --> 01:10:42.805
SECONDS. WE ARE ALSO PHASE TWO

01:10:42.871 --> 01:10:45.808
DOES NOT PRESUPPOSE THAT THE

01:10:45.874 --> 01:10:48.043
BEST FORM IT COULD POTENTIALLY

01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:50.079
BE AN IOU IS THE BEST FORM.

01:10:50.145 --> 01:10:52.548
RIGHT. AND SO WE ARE NOT JUST

01:10:52.615 --> 01:10:54.817
LIKE MANY OF THE THINGS THEY DO.

01:10:54.883 --> 01:10:56.218
IT'S I'M NOT NECESSARILY MARRIED

01:10:56.285 --> 01:10:57.653
TO THE WAY WE'RE DOING THINGS

01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:59.521
RIGHT NOW. AND I'M ALSO NOT

01:10:59.588 --> 01:11:00.155
MARRIED TO ONE PARTICULAR

01:11:00.222 --> 01:11:02.291
OUTCOME. THE STUDY IS TO FIND

01:11:02.358 --> 01:11:04.793
THE BEST OPTION FOR CALIFORNIANS

01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:07.896
ACROSS THE BOARD. IN MY DISTRICT

01:11:07.963 --> 01:11:09.498
ALONE, WE HAVE A CITY THAT

01:11:09.565 --> 01:11:12.001
ACTUALLY PROVIDES UTILITY

01:11:12.067 --> 01:11:13.969
SERVICES TO THEIR DISTRICT, AND

01:11:14.036 --> 01:11:16.338
THEY'RE DOING A FABULOUS JOB.

01:11:16.405 --> 01:11:18.907
AND THERE ARE ALSO SOME SMALLER

01:11:18.974 --> 01:11:20.042
UTILITY ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT

01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:21.744
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ARE

01:11:21.810 --> 01:11:24.313
DOING A VERY SOLID JOB

01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:26.048
THEMSELVES WITH A VERY DIFFERENT

01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:28.617
FORMULA AND MODEL. AND, YOU

01:11:28.684 --> 01:11:30.019
KNOW, I THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT

01:11:30.085 --> 01:11:32.187
OF LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE

01:11:32.254 --> 01:11:34.156
LOOKING FOR DIFFERENT AVENUES.

01:11:34.223 --> 01:11:37.259
AND THAT'S WHY WE TALK ABOUT THE

01:11:37.326 --> 01:11:39.094
COMMUNITY ENERGY. AND, YOU KNOW,

01:11:39.161 --> 01:11:40.095
THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT FORMS

01:11:40.162 --> 01:11:41.730
OUT THERE THAT WE'RE JUST

01:11:41.797 --> 01:11:43.265
LOOKING TO SEE WHAT WOULD

01:11:43.332 --> 01:11:45.234
POTENTIALLY BE THE BEST FOR

01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:48.037
CALIFORNIANS. SO YEAH, I GUESS

01:11:48.103 --> 01:11:50.539
WHAT I'D SAY I MEAN, I'M LOOKING

01:11:50.606 --> 01:11:53.809
AT SORT OF THE. SO TWO THINGS.

01:11:53.876 --> 01:11:55.177
SO TAKING A STEP BACK ON THE

01:11:55.244 --> 01:11:58.347
BILL AS A WHOLE, I, I HOPE YOU

01:11:58.414 --> 01:12:01.350
WILL CONTINUE WORKING ON THE

01:12:01.417 --> 01:12:03.819
LANGUAGE SO THAT IT'S A MORE

01:12:03.886 --> 01:12:05.087
NEUTRAL STUDY AND DOESN'T HAVE

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:07.790
ALL OF THESE CONCLUSORY

01:12:07.856 --> 01:12:08.891
STATEMENTS, BECAUSE I WAS TRYING

01:12:08.957 --> 01:12:10.292
TO FIND IT HERE. BUT ONE OF THE

01:12:10.359 --> 01:12:12.127
THINGS IN THE BILL IS THAT WE

01:12:12.194 --> 01:12:13.896
HAVE CONCLUDED THAT MOVING AWAY

01:12:13.962 --> 01:12:16.799
FROM OUR SYSTEM IS THE CORRECT

01:12:16.865 --> 01:12:18.500
OUTCOME, AND I DON'T KNOW THAT

01:12:18.567 --> 01:12:19.501
THAT'S THE ANSWER. MAYBE, BUT IT

01:12:19.568 --> 01:12:22.137
MAY NOT BE. AND IF THAT'S IN THE

01:12:22.204 --> 01:12:23.706
BILL, I DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN

01:12:23.772 --> 01:12:25.441
SUPPORT IT. AND I YOU KNOW, I'D

01:12:25.507 --> 01:12:26.842
LIKE TO SEE A COMMITMENT THAT

01:12:26.909 --> 01:12:28.377
YOU'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY REVISIT

01:12:28.444 --> 01:12:30.879
THAT, BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT

01:12:30.946 --> 01:12:31.547
WILL SEND A TERRIBLE SIGNAL TO

01:12:31.613 --> 01:12:33.816
THE FINANCIAL MARKETS. IF WHAT

01:12:33.882 --> 01:12:35.617
COMES OUT OF THIS BILL TODAY IS

01:12:35.684 --> 01:12:37.286
THAT WE HAVE DECIDED THAT WE'RE

01:12:37.352 --> 01:12:39.555
BASICALLY UNDOING ALL OUR IOUS.

01:12:39.621 --> 01:12:42.324
SO I, I'M HOPING YOU'LL SAY THAT

01:12:42.391 --> 01:12:43.592
ON THE RECORD THAT THAT'S NOT

01:12:43.659 --> 01:12:45.461
THE INTENTION. THIS IS NOT THIS

01:12:45.527 --> 01:12:46.795
IS AN EVENHANDED STUDY. YEAH, IT

01:12:46.862 --> 01:12:48.564
IS A FAIR STUDY. AND THE WHOLE

01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:50.365
POINT OF A STUDY IS, HONESTLY,

01:12:50.432 --> 01:12:52.167
TO GET A NEUTRAL OUTCOME OUT OF

01:12:52.234 --> 01:12:55.738
IT AS TO WHAT IS COMING, WHAT IS

01:12:55.804 --> 01:12:57.473
THE BEST FOR CALIFORNIANS, AND

01:12:57.539 --> 01:12:59.742
MAYBE FOR MORE FIRE PRONE AREAS.

01:12:59.808 --> 01:13:01.877
IT'S A DIFFERENT MODEL, AND FOR

01:13:01.944 --> 01:13:03.212
METRO AREAS, IT'S A DIFFERENT

01:13:03.278 --> 01:13:05.647
MODEL. AND, YOU KNOW, THE STUDY

01:13:05.714 --> 01:13:07.850
IS LARGELY TO TAKE A LOOK AT

01:13:07.916 --> 01:13:09.852
THAT AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN

01:13:09.918 --> 01:13:11.487
TO SEE WHAT IS THE BEST MODEL

01:13:11.553 --> 01:13:13.288
FOR THE RESIDENTS. AND OBVIOUSLY

01:13:13.355 --> 01:13:14.389
WE LIVE IN DIFFERENT

01:13:14.456 --> 01:13:16.291
ENVIRONMENTS. THIS IS NOT A BILL

01:13:16.358 --> 01:13:18.060
THAT, AND I'VE BEEN VERY

01:13:18.127 --> 01:13:20.796
TRANSPARENT WITH SOME OF THE

01:13:20.863 --> 01:13:23.699
OPPOSITION FOLKS. I'M NOT

01:13:23.766 --> 01:13:25.601
INTERESTED IN COMPLETELY

01:13:25.667 --> 01:13:26.568
DISMANTLING THE INDUSTRY. THAT

01:13:26.635 --> 01:13:28.771
THAT IS NOT A GOAL, EVER. THE

01:13:28.837 --> 01:13:30.205
GOAL IS TO FIND THE BEST

01:13:30.272 --> 01:13:31.640
OUTCOMES FOR THE PROBLEMS WE ARE

01:13:31.707 --> 01:13:33.375
SEEING, WHICH IS THESE WILDFIRES

01:13:33.442 --> 01:13:35.210
THAT WE HAVE ALSO SEEN THE

01:13:35.277 --> 01:13:36.645
INDUSTRY NOT INVEST AS MUCH AS

01:13:36.712 --> 01:13:38.480
THEY CAN. AND I WILL GIVE AN

01:13:38.547 --> 01:13:40.682
EXAMPLE. YOU KNOW, THERE'S

01:13:40.749 --> 01:13:43.519
10,000 MILES OF CRITICAL LINES

01:13:43.585 --> 01:13:46.054
THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY

01:13:46.121 --> 01:13:48.557
PGE, IN PARTICULAR TO

01:13:48.624 --> 01:13:51.059
UNDERGROUND. AND THE REALITY IS

01:13:51.126 --> 01:13:53.595
THEY ALSO HAVE 100,000 MILES OF

01:13:53.662 --> 01:13:55.330
LINE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:13:55.397 --> 01:13:57.699
BUT THE FOCUS HAS BEEN ON THE

01:13:57.766 --> 01:13:58.734
10,000, AND WE'RE NOWHERE NEAR

01:13:58.801 --> 01:14:00.936
HITTING THAT MARK. IT'S GOING TO

01:14:01.003 --> 01:14:02.371
PROBABLY TAKE US TEN YEARS TO

01:14:02.437 --> 01:14:03.639
GET TO THAT, TO JUST UNDERGROUND

01:14:03.705 --> 01:14:06.642
THE 10,000. SO THERE'S CLEAR

01:14:06.708 --> 01:14:07.743
FAILURES THAT WE ARE SEEING. WE

01:14:07.810 --> 01:14:09.478
ARE SEEING MORE AND MORE FIRES

01:14:09.545 --> 01:14:10.979
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

01:14:11.046 --> 01:14:13.515
CALIFORNIA. WE ARE SEEING PEOPLE

01:14:13.582 --> 01:14:15.017
STRUGGLE TO GET THEIR HOUSING,

01:14:15.083 --> 01:14:16.785
PROPERTY AND LIVES ARE IN

01:14:16.852 --> 01:14:18.587
DANGER. THE STUDY IS A NEUTRAL

01:14:18.654 --> 01:14:20.055
STUDY. WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK

01:14:20.122 --> 01:14:21.957
WITH OPPOSITION AND FOLKS TO

01:14:22.024 --> 01:14:22.858
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING

01:14:22.925 --> 01:14:25.093
ALL THE CONCERNS. BUT THE GOAL

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:27.996
OF THIS BILL, THE GOAL OF THE

01:14:28.063 --> 01:14:28.564
STUDY, IS TO PRIORITIZE THE

01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:30.432
NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS.

01:14:30.499 --> 01:14:32.901
SO I'M COMMITTED TO THAT. AND I

01:14:32.968 --> 01:14:34.002
THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT WE ALL

01:14:34.069 --> 01:14:35.904
ARE COMMITTED TO FIRST AND

01:14:35.971 --> 01:14:37.706
FOREMOST. AND OF COURSE, AS MUCH

01:14:37.773 --> 01:14:39.341
AS POSSIBLE, FIND IT THE MOST

01:14:39.408 --> 01:14:40.976
AFFORDABLE WAY. THAT'S SOMETHING

01:14:41.043 --> 01:14:42.110
I'M PERSONALLY AM VERY COMMITTED

01:14:42.177 --> 01:14:44.479
TO. SO MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK

01:14:44.546 --> 01:14:45.981
WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED.

01:14:46.048 --> 01:14:46.949
THAT'S GREAT. I MEAN, WHAT I'M

01:14:47.015 --> 01:14:49.184
HEARING IS THIS IS NOT A SIGNAL

01:14:49.251 --> 01:14:50.219
TO THE FINANCIAL MARKETS THAT

01:14:50.285 --> 01:14:51.687
CALIFORNIA HAS MADE A DECISION

01:14:51.753 --> 01:14:53.355
TO MOVE AWAY FROM OUR MODEL.

01:14:53.422 --> 01:14:54.089
THIS IS SIMPLY AN EVENHANDED

01:14:54.156 --> 01:14:55.757
STUDY TO LOOK AT THAT ISSUE. AND

01:14:55.824 --> 01:14:58.327
I THINK THE LAST THING I WOULD

01:14:58.393 --> 01:15:00.796
ASK YOU TO DO IS I KNOW THAT

01:15:00.863 --> 01:15:02.331
THERE'S SOME PRIVACY CONCERNS

01:15:02.397 --> 01:15:04.099
THAT THE IOUS HAVE RAISED

01:15:04.166 --> 01:15:05.267
RELATED TO THE EXECUTIVE

01:15:05.334 --> 01:15:06.468
COMPENSATION. I JUST LIKE A

01:15:06.535 --> 01:15:07.302
COMMITMENT THAT YOU'LL CONTINUE

01:15:07.369 --> 01:15:08.470
WORKING WITH THEM AND

01:15:08.537 --> 01:15:09.938
UNDERSTANDING WHAT THOSE ARE.

01:15:10.005 --> 01:15:11.506
YES, I'D LOVE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT

01:15:11.573 --> 01:15:13.208
THAT. AND THERE ARE SOME

01:15:13.275 --> 01:15:14.209
COMPANIES THAT ARE OBVIOUSLY

01:15:14.276 --> 01:15:16.545
PUBLICLY TRADED AS WELL. AND SO

01:15:16.612 --> 01:15:17.880
THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE

01:15:17.946 --> 01:15:19.448
LIVE REPORTS THAT THEY HAVE TO

01:15:19.514 --> 01:15:22.317
SHARE. SO THERE'S A LOT OF

01:15:22.384 --> 01:15:22.885
INFORMATION THAT'S ALREADY

01:15:22.951 --> 01:15:23.485
AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC TOO.

01:15:23.552 --> 01:15:25.120
THANK YOU SENATOR. APPRECIATE

01:15:25.187 --> 01:15:26.722
IT. THANK YOU. AND I WOULD ALSO

01:15:26.788 --> 01:15:28.423
JUST TO FOR POINT OF

01:15:28.490 --> 01:15:29.758
CLARIFICATION, SO THE AMENDMENTS

01:15:29.825 --> 01:15:31.627
DO YOU RAISED A COUPLE OF

01:15:31.693 --> 01:15:32.461
CONCERNS, I THINK, ABOUT THE

01:15:32.527 --> 01:15:34.463
LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS. SO THE

01:15:34.529 --> 01:15:37.399
BILL AS AMENDED NARROW THE

01:15:37.466 --> 01:15:38.533
LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS TO

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:42.037
VERIFIABLE FACTS, AND THEN IT

01:15:42.104 --> 01:15:43.605
MODIFIES THE STUDY TO REQUIRE AN

01:15:43.672 --> 01:15:46.108
INTERIM REPORT AFTER ONE YEAR ON

01:15:46.174 --> 01:15:47.409
THRESHOLD LEGAL ISSUES RELATED

01:15:47.476 --> 01:15:49.278
TO TRANSITION OF IOUS TO EACH

01:15:49.344 --> 01:15:51.513
NONPROFIT CORPORATE FORM. SO I

01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:53.282
THINK THAT ADDRESSES SOME OF THE

01:15:53.348 --> 01:15:54.950
CONCERNS THAT YOU RAISED AND

01:15:55.017 --> 01:15:56.985
APPRECIATE WORKING WITH THE

01:15:57.052 --> 01:16:00.122
SENATOR ON THIS ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:16:00.188 --> 01:16:01.823
CALDERON. YES. THANK YOU, MADAM

01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:04.393
CHAIR. YOU KNOW, I'M GOING TO

01:16:04.459 --> 01:16:06.428
ALIGN MY COMMENTS AND CONCERNS

01:16:06.495 --> 01:16:10.165
WITH, WITH ASSEMBLYMAN BURR,

01:16:10.232 --> 01:16:11.533
SOME OF THE LANGUAGE IN THIS

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:12.968
BILL TEXT IS REALLY, REALLY

01:16:13.035 --> 01:16:14.670
STRONG. AND I THINK HE MAY HAVE

01:16:14.736 --> 01:16:15.570
MENTIONED THIS. THE PAST AND

01:16:15.637 --> 01:16:17.205
PRESENT EXPERIENCE DEMONSTRATES

01:16:17.272 --> 01:16:18.874
THAT THE IOUS PRIORITIZE PROFITS

01:16:18.941 --> 01:16:21.109
OVER THE SAFETY AND WELL-BEING

01:16:21.176 --> 01:16:22.477
OF THE RATEPAYERS AND RESIDENTS

01:16:22.544 --> 01:16:24.579
OF CALIFORNIA AND GOES ON AND ON

01:16:24.646 --> 01:16:27.349
AND ON. AND SO, YOU KNOW, THAT

01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:29.851
WAS NOT MY EXPERIENCE WORKING

01:16:29.918 --> 01:16:32.754
FOR AN IOU FOR 25 YEARS. I CAN

01:16:32.821 --> 01:16:35.324
TELL YOU IT WAS ALWAYS THE

01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:37.025
RATEPAYERS AFFORDABILITY AND THE

01:16:37.092 --> 01:16:39.828
SAFETY OF THEIR WORKFORCE AND

01:16:39.895 --> 01:16:42.831
RELIABILITY. AND SO AND I'M ALSO

01:16:42.898 --> 01:16:44.700
CONCERNED ABOUT POTENTIAL

01:16:44.766 --> 01:16:47.469
SIGNALS TO INVESTORS. I MEAN, WE

01:16:47.536 --> 01:16:49.271
SIT IN THIS LITTLE ROOM HERE,

01:16:49.338 --> 01:16:51.940
BUT PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD

01:16:52.007 --> 01:16:53.108
ARE WATCHING WHAT CALIFORNIA IS

01:16:53.175 --> 01:16:56.912
DOING. OR WATCHING WHAT

01:16:56.979 --> 01:17:00.515
CALIFORNIA IS DOING. AND WE MAY

01:17:00.582 --> 01:17:02.417
NOT REALIZE IT, BUT IT DOES

01:17:02.484 --> 01:17:04.319
SIGNAL TO THE MARKETS AND IT

01:17:04.386 --> 01:17:06.221
DOES AFFECT ULTIMATELY THE

01:17:06.288 --> 01:17:09.224
RATEPAYER. IF THE COST BECOMES

01:17:09.291 --> 01:17:12.060
TOO GREAT TO BORROW. AND SO FOR

01:17:12.127 --> 01:17:14.196
THAT REASON, I'M NOT GOING TO BE

01:17:14.262 --> 01:17:15.664
ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL. OKAY.

01:17:15.731 --> 01:17:17.733
AND I APPRECIATE THAT. AND I

01:17:17.799 --> 01:17:20.969
AGAIN WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT IN

01:17:21.036 --> 01:17:26.074
THE LA TIMES JUST THIS PAST MAY.

01:17:26.141 --> 01:17:27.743
EDISON'S SAFETY RECORD DECLINED

01:17:27.809 --> 01:17:30.979
LAST YEAR. EDISON SAFETY RECORD

01:17:31.046 --> 01:17:32.581
DECLINED LAST YEAR, THE NUMBER

01:17:32.647 --> 01:17:34.616
OF FIRES SPARKED BY ITS

01:17:34.683 --> 01:17:36.485
EQUIPMENT SOARED TO 178 FROM 90

01:17:36.551 --> 01:17:39.121
THE YEAR BEFORE AND 39% ABOVE

01:17:39.187 --> 01:17:41.423
THE FIVE YEAR AVERAGE. SERIOUS

01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:43.325
INJURIES INJURIES SUFFERED BY

01:17:43.392 --> 01:17:46.495
EMPLOYEES JUMPED BY 56% OVER THE

01:17:46.561 --> 01:17:47.963
AVERAGE. FIVE CONTRACTORS

01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:50.332
WORKING ON ITS ELECTRICAL SYSTEM

01:17:50.399 --> 01:17:53.035
DIED AND APRIL 1ST REPORT.

01:17:53.101 --> 01:17:54.936
EDISON TOLD REGULATORS THEY CUT

01:17:55.003 --> 01:17:55.704
EXECUTIVE BONUSES AWARDED FOR

01:17:55.771 --> 01:17:57.973
THE 2024 YEAR. IN THE REPORT,

01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:00.008
EDISON SAID THAT BECAUSE ITS

01:18:00.075 --> 01:18:03.211
SAFETY RECORD WORSENED IN 2024

01:18:03.278 --> 01:18:05.013
ON CERTAIN KEY METRICS, ITS

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:06.014
EXECUTIVES TOOK A TOTAL

01:18:06.081 --> 01:18:08.583
DEDUCTION OF 18 POINTS. BUT CASH

01:18:08.650 --> 01:18:10.685
BONUSES FOR FOUR OF EDISON'S TOP

01:18:10.752 --> 01:18:11.820
EXECUTIVES ACTUALLY ROSE LAST

01:18:11.887 --> 01:18:13.789
YEAR BY AS MUCH AS 17%,

01:18:13.855 --> 01:18:15.457
ACCORDING TO A SEPARATE MARCH

01:18:15.524 --> 01:18:17.259
REPORT BY EDISON TO FEDERAL

01:18:17.325 --> 01:18:18.760
REGULATORS. I ALSO WANT TO

01:18:18.827 --> 01:18:20.395
HIGHLIGHT THAT PGE HAS

01:18:20.462 --> 01:18:21.997
SPECIFICALLY COME EVEN THIS PAST

01:18:22.064 --> 01:18:25.167
YEAR FOR RATE INCREASES,

01:18:25.233 --> 01:18:27.269
SPECIFICALLY TO PAY OUT THEIR

01:18:27.335 --> 01:18:28.637
SHAREHOLDERS. THAT WAS THE

01:18:28.703 --> 01:18:30.472
ACTUAL REQUEST. OVER AND OVER WE

01:18:30.539 --> 01:18:32.974
ARE SEEING THIS. SO I UNDERSTAND

01:18:33.041 --> 01:18:34.876
THE CONCERNS. AND LIKE I MADE

01:18:34.943 --> 01:18:36.511
THE COMMITMENT JUST A MINUTE

01:18:36.578 --> 01:18:39.214
AGO, WE ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO

01:18:39.281 --> 01:18:41.149
WORK WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS

01:18:41.216 --> 01:18:42.684
INVOLVED, BECAUSE WE DO KNOW

01:18:42.751 --> 01:18:44.386
THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE

01:18:44.453 --> 01:18:46.621
POWER TO RESIDENTS FIRST AND

01:18:46.688 --> 01:18:49.224
FOREMOST, RIGHT? BUT WE ALSO

01:18:49.291 --> 01:18:51.593
HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:53.395
HOLDING THESE KEY STAKEHOLDERS

01:18:53.462 --> 01:18:55.530
ACCOUNTABLE WHEN NECESSARY. WE

01:18:55.597 --> 01:18:57.632
NEED TO PRIORITIZE

01:18:57.699 --> 01:19:00.068
AFFORDABILITY, SAFETY AND, YOU

01:19:00.135 --> 01:19:02.137
KNOW, BUILDING FOR OUR FUTURE.

01:19:02.204 --> 01:19:04.606
AND SO I WANT TO REMIND

01:19:04.673 --> 01:19:06.341
EVERYBODY THAT EARLY THIS

01:19:06.408 --> 01:19:08.176
JANUARY, JANUARY, A WINTER

01:19:08.243 --> 01:19:11.513
MONTH, WE SAW ON JANUARY 7TH ONE

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:13.315
OF THE MOST MASSIVE FIRES THAT

01:19:13.381 --> 01:19:15.383
WE HAVE EVER SEEN IN THE STATE

01:19:15.450 --> 01:19:17.652
OF CALIFORNIA. LIVES AS WELL AS

01:19:17.719 --> 01:19:18.620
PROPERTY WERE LOST, WHICH IS

01:19:18.687 --> 01:19:20.922
GOING TO TAKE YEARS, NOT ONLY TO

01:19:20.989 --> 01:19:22.657
CLEAN UP THAT MESS, BUT THEN

01:19:22.724 --> 01:19:28.630
ALSO REBUILD. AND THERE IS A

01:19:28.697 --> 01:19:30.665
TOLL ON THE PUBLIC, THE COST,

01:19:30.732 --> 01:19:32.701
THE CITY, THE COUNTY, THE PEOPLE

01:19:32.767 --> 01:19:34.069
AND THE COMMUNITY AND THE STATE

01:19:34.136 --> 01:19:36.138
OF CALIFORNIA. WHEN WE ARE

01:19:36.204 --> 01:19:37.939
TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE ARE GOING

01:19:38.006 --> 01:19:39.941
TO PRIORITIZE, WHAT WE ARE GOING

01:19:40.008 --> 01:19:42.144
TO DO. SO AS MUCH AS I'M

01:19:42.210 --> 01:19:43.178
SENSITIVE TO INDUSTRY AND MAKING

01:19:43.245 --> 01:19:44.980
SURE THAT WE DON'T ROCK THE BOAT

01:19:45.046 --> 01:19:48.049
TOO MUCH, I ALSO WANT TO BE ABLE

01:19:48.116 --> 01:19:49.151
TO PROACTIVELY AND AGGRESSIVELY

01:19:49.217 --> 01:19:51.353
SEE ARE THERE OTHER OPTIONS THAT

01:19:51.419 --> 01:19:53.054
BETTER SERVE OUR COMMUNITY WHEN

01:19:53.121 --> 01:19:54.789
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SAFETY

01:19:54.856 --> 01:19:56.124
METRICS, WHEN WE ARE TALKING

01:19:56.191 --> 01:19:57.959
ABOUT AFFORDABILITY, WHEN WE ARE

01:19:58.026 --> 01:20:00.495
TALKING ABOUT OUR FUTURE AND THE

01:20:00.562 --> 01:20:01.796
ENVIRONMENT, I KNOW THAT BOTH

01:20:01.863 --> 01:20:03.031
HOUSES HAVE MADE COMMITMENTS

01:20:03.098 --> 01:20:04.900
ABOUT WILDFIRE PACKAGES. THIS IS

01:20:04.966 --> 01:20:06.268
SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS

01:20:06.334 --> 01:20:08.003
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WHEN WE ARE

01:20:08.069 --> 01:20:10.505
TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE SAW. AND I

01:20:10.572 --> 01:20:12.941
KNOW THAT DISTANCE MAKES THE

01:20:13.008 --> 01:20:16.178
FEELING A LITTLE BIT MORE DULL,

01:20:16.244 --> 01:20:18.713
BUT I HAVE GONE TO THE LA

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:21.283
WILDFIRE AREA AND IT'S

01:20:21.349 --> 01:20:23.118
DEVASTATING TO SEE THAT AND THE

01:20:23.185 --> 01:20:24.085
FAMILIES AND WHAT WE ARE

01:20:24.152 --> 01:20:25.720
FIGHTING FOR ON ALMOST THE

01:20:25.787 --> 01:20:27.389
MAJORITY OF OUR BILLS IS REALLY

01:20:27.455 --> 01:20:29.124
TO KIND OF MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE

01:20:29.191 --> 01:20:32.427
ARE WHOLE. SO RESPECTFULLY, I

01:20:32.494 --> 01:20:34.129
THINK THAT THIS IS A GOOD BILL.

01:20:34.196 --> 01:20:35.697
I THINK IT'S FAIR, AND I THINK

01:20:35.764 --> 01:20:41.636
IT'S WHAT THE PUBLIC WANTS.

01:20:41.703 --> 01:20:43.471
SEEING NO FURTHER QUESTIONS, I

01:20:43.538 --> 01:20:45.073
WILL AGAIN, JUST JUST NOTE THAT,

01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:48.944
AS AMENDED, THE AMENDMENTS

01:20:49.010 --> 01:20:50.245
NARROW ANY OF THE LEGISLATIVE

01:20:50.312 --> 01:20:52.147
FINDINGS, NOT TO MATTERS OF

01:20:52.214 --> 01:20:54.449
OPINION OR SUBJECTIVITY, BUT TO

01:20:54.516 --> 01:20:55.383
VERIFIABLE FACTS. I WILL NOTE

01:20:55.450 --> 01:20:57.485
THAT BEFORE WE MOVE. ALL RIGHT.

01:20:57.552 --> 01:20:59.020
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE

01:20:59.087 --> 01:21:00.889
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE

01:21:00.956 --> 01:21:03.024
VOTE? ALL RIGHT. WE ARE ONE

01:21:03.091 --> 01:21:05.160
SHORT OF A QUORUM. SO WE WILL

01:21:05.227 --> 01:21:06.661
USE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:21:06.728 --> 01:21:09.831
URGE MEMBERS TO JOIN US IN ROOM

01:21:09.898 --> 01:21:11.866
437. AND THEN WE WILL TAKE UP

01:21:11.933 --> 01:21:13.635
THAT BILL FOR A VOTE AT THE

01:21:13.702 --> 01:21:16.671
APPROPRIATE TIME. MOVING TO FILE

01:21:16.738 --> 01:21:19.074

COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH

01:23:08.483 --> 01:23:10.085
OUR OFFICE. AND WE WILL BE

01:23:10.151 --> 01:23:10.719
ACCEPTING COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS.

01:23:10.785 --> 01:23:11.853
THIS BILL WOULD CREATE THE

01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:12.420
RATEPAYER AND TECHNOLOGICAL

01:23:12.487 --> 01:23:13.388
INNOVATION PROTECTION ACT, WHICH

01:23:13.455 --> 01:23:15.256
WOULD REQUIRE THE PUC TO

01:23:15.323 --> 01:23:16.591
ESTABLISH A TARIFF FOR LARGE

01:23:16.658 --> 01:23:18.360
ENERGY USERS TO PREVENT COST

01:23:18.426 --> 01:23:20.895
SHIFTS TO OTHER RATEPAYERS, AND

01:23:20.962 --> 01:23:22.263
TO ALSO TRY TO AVOID STRANDED

01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:24.499
ASSETS COSTS BEING LEFT WITH

01:23:24.566 --> 01:23:26.634
NON-CONNECTED RATEPAYERS. US IS

01:23:26.701 --> 01:23:28.470
UNDERGOING, AS YOU KNOW, AN AI

01:23:28.536 --> 01:23:29.904
REVOLUTION WHICH IS POWERED BY

01:23:29.971 --> 01:23:31.506
MASSIVE, AT TIMES DATA CENTERS

01:23:31.573 --> 01:23:33.541
AND OTHER LARGE CONSUMERS. THESE

01:23:33.608 --> 01:23:34.776
CONSUME LARGE AMOUNTS OF ENERGY

01:23:34.843 --> 01:23:36.444
AND WATER, PUTTING STRAIN IN

01:23:36.511 --> 01:23:39.347
CREATING A SUDDEN AND OFTEN

01:23:39.414 --> 01:23:40.815
IMMEDIATELY TEMPORARY SCARCITY

01:23:40.882 --> 01:23:42.217
IN SUPPLY OF ENERGY, WHICH THEN

01:23:42.283 --> 01:23:43.618
HAS A DIRECT RESULT ON

01:23:43.685 --> 01:23:45.353
INCREMENTAL COSTS TO RATEPAYERS.

01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:47.188
THEY REQUIRE MASSIVE

01:23:47.255 --> 01:23:48.256
INVESTMENTS, MASSIVE

01:23:48.323 --> 01:23:49.758
INFRASTRUCTURE AND INCREASED

01:23:49.824 --> 01:23:51.893
RELIANCE ON FOSSIL FUELS.

01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:53.228
VIRGINIA, WHICH HAS THE HIGHEST

01:23:53.294 --> 01:23:54.362
CONCENTRATION OF DATA CENTERS IN

01:23:54.429 --> 01:23:55.697
THIS COUNTRY, IS FACING AN

01:23:55.764 --> 01:23:56.898
ENERGY SHORTAGE AND INCREASED

01:23:56.965 --> 01:23:58.733
ENERGY COSTS. IT'S NOT JUST

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:00.201
AFFECTING THEIR STATE, BUT THE

01:24:00.268 --> 01:24:02.404
ENTIRE EASTERN GRID MANAGED BY

01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:04.839
PJM. TO GET A SENSE OF SCALE,

01:24:04.906 --> 01:24:05.707
MICROSOFT SIGNED THE LARGEST

01:24:09.043 --> 01:24:10.912
THE COMPANY'S DATA CENTERS, AND

01:24:10.979 --> 01:24:13.415
AMAZON IS BUILDING A 2.2GW DATA

01:24:13.481 --> 01:24:14.949
CENTER, CONSUMING THE SAME

01:24:15.016 --> 01:24:17.085
AMOUNT OF ENERGY AS 1 MILLION

01:24:17.152 --> 01:24:19.354
HOMES. ANALYSTS WARN. THIS RAPID

01:24:19.421 --> 01:24:20.955
BUILD OUT OF DATA CENTERS MAY BE

01:24:21.022 --> 01:24:22.457
OUTPACING DEMAND, AND WITH

01:24:22.524 --> 01:24:24.492
INNOVATIONS IN ENERGY COMPUTING,

01:24:24.559 --> 01:24:26.428
SOME OF THESE CENTERS MAY CLOSE

01:24:26.494 --> 01:24:28.229
EARLIER THAN EXPECTED OR USE

01:24:28.296 --> 01:24:30.064
LESS ENERGY THAN INITIALLY

01:24:30.131 --> 01:24:31.566
PROJECTED. THIS IS A RAPIDLY

01:24:31.633 --> 01:24:34.335
EVOLVING ENERGY INDUSTRY. LARGE

01:24:34.402 --> 01:24:37.038

THE BILL FOR THEIR TRANSMISSION

01:24:40.842 --> 01:24:42.677
AND INTERCONNECTION COSTS. OTHER

01:24:42.744 --> 01:24:44.045
STATES SUCH AS OHIO, GEORGIA,

01:24:44.112 --> 01:24:45.713
TEXAS AND INDIANA HAVE ALREADY

01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:47.415
TAKEN STEPS TO PROTECT THEIR

01:24:47.482 --> 01:24:48.683

UPFRONT PAYMENTS. IN FACT, THE

01:24:53.621 --> 01:24:55.156
NEW YORK TIMES RECENTLY REPORTED

01:24:55.223 --> 01:24:57.058
THAT LARGE ENERGY USERS OFTEN

01:24:57.125 --> 01:24:59.227
DID NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF THE

01:24:59.294 --> 01:25:01.229
EQUIPMENT NEEDED TO SERVE THE

01:25:01.296 --> 01:25:02.130

SMALL BUSINESSES TO FOOT THE

01:25:03.598 --> 01:25:05.366
BILL. RATEPAYERS ARE ALREADY

01:25:05.433 --> 01:25:06.734
STRUGGLING WITH AFFORDABILITY.

01:25:06.801 --> 01:25:08.169
THEY SHOULD NOT BE FORCED TO PAY

PRINT CONTAINS SPECIFIC AND

01:25:33.461 --> 01:25:34.829
MEANINGFUL DIRECTION TO THE

01:25:34.896 --> 01:25:36.331
CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES

01:25:36.397 --> 01:25:37.665
COMMISSION FOR INVESTOR OWNED

01:25:37.732 --> 01:25:39.100
UTILITY ELECTRICAL TARIFFS

01:25:39.167 --> 01:25:41.135
SERVING LARGE DATA CENTER

01:25:41.202 --> 01:25:42.537
CUSTOMERS. THE BILL IS INTENDED

01:25:42.604 --> 01:25:43.404
TO ENSURE THAT THESE TARIFFS

01:25:43.471 --> 01:25:45.640
PROTECT NONPARTICIPATING

01:25:45.707 --> 01:25:47.008
CUSTOMERS, ENSURE A FAIR SHARING

01:25:47.075 --> 01:25:49.611
OF COSTS BY ALL CONSUMERS, AND

01:25:49.677 --> 01:25:50.979
PROMOTE GREATER USE OF CLEAN

01:25:51.045 --> 01:25:52.547
ENERGY AND DISTRIBUTED ENERGY

01:25:52.614 --> 01:25:55.016
RESOURCES BY THESE FACILITIES.

01:25:55.083 --> 01:25:56.484
FORECASTS OF HUGE GROWTH IN NEW

01:25:56.551 --> 01:25:58.419
DATA CENTER LOADS HAVE LED TO

01:25:58.486 --> 01:26:00.054
CONCERNS ABOUT THE NEED FOR GRID

01:26:00.121 --> 01:26:01.055
UPGRADES, THE AMOUNT OF

01:26:01.122 --> 01:26:02.957
ELECTRICITY TO BE CONSUMED BY

01:26:03.024 --> 01:26:04.092
THESE FACILITIES, COST SHIFTING

01:26:04.158 --> 01:26:05.793
AND POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON

01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:07.195
PROGRESS TOWARDS CALIFORNIA'S

01:26:07.262 --> 01:26:08.663
ZERO CARBON ELECTRICITY

01:26:08.730 --> 01:26:10.365
OBJECTIVES. SB 57 ADDRESSES

01:26:10.431 --> 01:26:12.700
THESE CONCERNS IN A MANNER THAT

01:26:12.767 --> 01:26:14.102
BALANCES THE INTERESTS OF DATA

01:26:14.168 --> 01:26:15.537
CENTERS AND THE BROADER NEEDS OF

01:26:15.603 --> 01:26:18.106
ALL ELECTRICITY CONSUMERS. AND

01:26:18.172 --> 01:26:19.107
ALTHOUGH THE COMMITTEE

01:26:19.173 --> 01:26:20.341
AMENDMENTS WEAKEN THE ELEMENTS

01:26:20.408 --> 01:26:21.976
OF THE BILL DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE

01:26:22.043 --> 01:26:23.711
THESE OBJECTIVES, AND WE WOULD

01:26:23.778 --> 01:26:25.580
PREFER MORE MEANINGFUL AND

01:26:25.647 --> 01:26:26.714
BINDING DIRECTION TO THE

01:26:26.781 --> 01:26:28.583
CALIFORNIA PUC, THE AMENDED

01:26:28.650 --> 01:26:30.618
LANGUAGE STILL ADDRESSES MANY OF

01:26:30.685 --> 01:26:32.620
TURNS CORE CONCERNS. IN

01:26:32.687 --> 01:26:33.454
PARTICULAR, WE APPRECIATE

01:26:33.521 --> 01:26:35.189
SEVERAL OF THE KEY ELEMENTS.

01:26:35.256 --> 01:26:36.124
FIRST, THE REQUIREMENT TO

01:26:36.190 --> 01:26:38.026
MINIMIZE ANY COST SHIFTING TO

01:26:38.092 --> 01:26:39.260
NONPARTICIPATING CUSTOMERS.

01:26:39.327 --> 01:26:40.695
SECOND, ENSURING THAT DATA

01:26:40.762 --> 01:26:41.896
CENTERS CONNECTING DIRECTLY TO

01:26:41.963 --> 01:26:43.631
THE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM ARE

01:26:43.698 --> 01:26:44.999
REQUIRED TO CONTRIBUTE A

01:26:45.066 --> 01:26:46.901
REASONABLE SHARE OF COSTS

01:26:46.968 --> 01:26:48.703
RELATING TO WILDFIRE MITIGATION,

01:26:48.770 --> 01:26:50.071
WILDFIRE LIABILITY,

01:26:50.138 --> 01:26:50.738
ELECTRIFICATION AND

01:26:50.805 --> 01:26:51.639
ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS, AND

01:26:51.706 --> 01:26:53.341
OTHER SOCIETAL COSTS, AND

01:26:53.408 --> 01:26:55.677
FINALLY, DIRECTING THE PUC TO

01:26:55.743 --> 01:26:56.811
CONSIDER HOW TO PRIORITIZE THE

01:26:56.878 --> 01:26:59.080
USE OF ON SITE ENERGY STORAGE,

01:26:59.147 --> 01:27:00.615
REDUCTIONS IN GREENHOUSE GAS

01:27:00.682 --> 01:27:01.549
EMISSIONS, PARTICIPATION IN

01:27:01.616 --> 01:27:03.151
DEMAND RESPONSE PROGRAMS, AND

01:27:03.217 --> 01:27:05.219
INCREASED USE OF ZERO CARBON

01:27:05.286 --> 01:27:07.021
RESOURCES. THESE ELEMENTS OF SB

01:27:07.088 --> 01:27:08.456
57 PROVIDE REASONABLE DIRECTION

01:27:08.523 --> 01:27:10.658
TO THE PUC, WHILE ALLOWING

01:27:10.725 --> 01:27:11.859
FLEXIBILITY WITH RESPECT TO THE

01:27:11.926 --> 01:27:13.127
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DETAILS,

01:27:13.194 --> 01:27:14.395
AND TURN BELIEVES THIS APPROACH

01:27:14.462 --> 01:27:15.897
WOULD ALLOW FOR CUSTOMERS TO

01:27:15.964 --> 01:27:17.131
BENEFIT FROM THE DOWNWARD

01:27:17.198 --> 01:27:18.433
PRESSURE ON RATES ATTRIBUTABLE

01:27:18.499 --> 01:27:19.968
TO NEW DATA CENTER LOADS,

01:27:20.034 --> 01:27:21.769
WITHOUT BEING FORCED TO ABSORB

01:27:21.836 --> 01:27:23.237
SIGNIFICANT NEW COSTS NECESSARY

01:27:23.304 --> 01:27:24.973
TO SERVE THESE UNIQUE CUSTOMERS.

01:27:25.039 --> 01:27:26.874
SO WITH THAT, WE ASK FOR AN AYE

01:27:26.941 --> 01:27:28.977
VOTE. GREETINGS, MADAM CHAIR,

01:27:29.043 --> 01:27:30.011
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY

NAME IS MARK MASON WITH

01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:32.580
CALIFORNIA. ENVIRONMENTAL VOTERS

01:27:32.647 --> 01:27:34.215
HOPE TO KEEP THIS SHORT AND

01:27:34.282 --> 01:27:35.550
SWEET LIKE SABRINA CARPENTER'S

01:27:35.617 --> 01:27:37.452
LAST ALBUM OF THE SAME TITLE. SO

01:27:37.518 --> 01:27:38.119
YEAH, THE EXPLOSIVE GROWTH OF AI

01:27:38.186 --> 01:27:39.520
COMES WITH A CORRESPONDING RISE

01:27:39.587 --> 01:27:41.289
OF MASSIVE DATA CENTERS, WHICH

01:27:41.356 --> 01:27:42.357
CONSUME LARGE AMOUNTS OF ENERGY

01:27:42.423 --> 01:27:43.791
AND WATER. THESE DATA CENTERS

01:27:43.858 --> 01:27:45.226
PUT ENORMOUS STRAIN ON THE

01:27:45.293 --> 01:27:46.027
ELECTRICAL GRID AND OTHER

01:27:46.094 --> 01:27:47.862
STATES, SUCH AS VIRGINIA AND THE

01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:48.663
EASTERN STATES. PJM ARE DEALING

01:27:48.730 --> 01:27:50.131
WITH SEVERE ENERGY SHORTAGES,

01:27:50.198 --> 01:27:51.265
HIGHER RISK OF ROLLING

01:27:51.332 --> 01:27:51.966
BLACKOUTS, AND SKYROCKETING

01:27:52.033 --> 01:27:54.836
ENERGY COSTS. SB 57 WOULD TASK

01:27:54.902 --> 01:27:55.570
UTILITIES COMMISSION WITH

01:27:55.637 --> 01:27:56.771
CREATING A LARGE ENERGY USER

01:27:56.838 --> 01:27:58.306
TARIFF TO PREVENT THESE COST

01:27:58.373 --> 01:27:59.574
SHIFTS ONTO RATEPAYERS. GIVEN

01:27:59.641 --> 01:28:01.142
THE CHEAPER RATES, HIGHER ENERGY

01:28:01.209 --> 01:28:02.343
USERS ARE OFTEN GIVEN THESE

01:28:02.410 --> 01:28:03.911
LARGE ENERGY USERS UNCHECKED

01:28:03.978 --> 01:28:04.946
GROWTH THREATEN OUR CLEAN ENERGY

01:28:05.013 --> 01:28:06.748
GOALS, AS WELL AS THE

01:28:06.814 --> 01:28:07.482
RELIABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY

01:28:07.548 --> 01:28:08.316
AND UTILITIES SCRAMBLING FOR

01:28:08.383 --> 01:28:10.084
MORE ENERGY THAT COULD EVEN BE

01:28:10.151 --> 01:28:11.085
DIRTIER. MOREOVER, IT'S A REAL

01:28:11.152 --> 01:28:13.655
RISK THAT THESE DATA CENTERS

01:28:13.721 --> 01:28:14.489
WOULD CLOSE BEFORE THEY PAY THE

01:28:14.555 --> 01:28:15.857
FULL COST OF THEIR SHARE OF

01:28:15.923 --> 01:28:16.424
TRANSMISSION INFRASTRUCTURE

01:28:16.491 --> 01:28:17.558
INVESTMENT. IF THERE IS NO

01:28:17.625 --> 01:28:18.393
TARIFF, WHICH LEAVES REGULAR

01:28:18.459 --> 01:28:19.360
CUSTOMERS ON THE HOOK FOR

01:28:19.427 --> 01:28:20.895
FUNDING THESE MAJOR COSTS, OTHER

01:28:20.962 --> 01:28:24.365
STATES SUCH AS GEORGIA, OHIO,

01:28:24.432 --> 01:28:25.500
TEXAS AND INDIANA AND MANY MORE

01:28:25.566 --> 01:28:27.168
HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE RISK THESE

01:28:27.235 --> 01:28:29.003
LARGE ENERGY USERS POSE AND HAVE

01:28:29.070 --> 01:28:29.671
IMPLEMENTED PROPOSALS SIMILAR TO

01:28:29.737 --> 01:28:30.738
THIS TO PROTECT THE RATEPAYERS

01:28:30.805 --> 01:28:32.507
FROM COVERING THE COST OF THESE

01:28:32.573 --> 01:28:33.408
ENERGY USERS SUPER CONNECTIONS

01:28:33.474 --> 01:28:35.276

01:28:35.343 --> 01:28:37.111

THERE YOU STATE ALL RIGHT. WE

CAN ONLY HAVE TWO. THERE'S THREE

01:29:59.894 --> 01:30:03.431
I DON'T KNOW WHO REGISTERED WHO.

01:30:08.703 --> 01:30:13.741
GOING. I DON'T KNOW ROCK, PAPER.

01:30:13.808 --> 01:30:15.943

YOURS. MADAM CHAIR. MEMBERS HERE

01:30:26.788 --> 01:30:27.889
ON BEHALF OF PACIFIC GAS AND

01:30:27.955 --> 01:30:29.724
ELECTRIC, LET ME BEGIN BY

01:30:29.791 --> 01:30:31.159
EMPHASIZING THE PGA STRONGLY

01:30:31.225 --> 01:30:33.027
SUPPORTS THE GOALS BEHIND THIS

01:30:33.094 --> 01:30:33.594
BILL. PROTECTING EXISTING

01:30:33.661 --> 01:30:35.396
UTILITY CUSTOMERS, LEVERAGING

01:30:35.463 --> 01:30:37.431
CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE LEADERSHIP

01:30:37.498 --> 01:30:38.933
AND CLEAN ENERGY GRID, AND

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.601
ENABLING ALL THE SIGNIFICANT NEW

01:30:40.668 --> 01:30:42.436
ELECTRICAL DEMAND, SOMETHING WE

01:30:42.503 --> 01:30:43.938
HAVEN'T SEEN IN DECADES. WE ARE

01:30:44.005 --> 01:30:45.706
CONCERNED THAT THE BILL'S RIGID

01:30:45.773 --> 01:30:46.874
REQUIREMENTS COULD LIMIT

01:30:46.941 --> 01:30:48.743
STAKEHOLDERS PGA AND THE CPUC S

01:30:48.810 --> 01:30:50.578
ABILITY TO RESPOND FLEXIBLY AND

01:30:50.645 --> 01:30:52.013
EFFECTIVELY TO MEET THESE GOALS.

01:30:52.079 --> 01:30:53.247
WE'VE BEEN DOING OUR BEST TO

01:30:53.314 --> 01:30:55.183
KEEP THE AUTHORS OFFICE UPDATED

01:30:55.249 --> 01:30:55.817
ON EVERYTHING THAT'S TRANSPIRED

01:30:55.883 --> 01:30:58.152
OVER THE LAST SEVEN MONTHS. IT'S

01:30:58.219 --> 01:30:59.487
MOVING AT A PRETTY FAST PACE. AT

01:30:59.554 --> 01:31:01.322
PGA, WE REFER TO NEW DEMAND FROM

01:31:01.389 --> 01:31:02.523
DATA CENTERS AND LARGE EV

01:31:02.590 --> 01:31:03.925
CHARGING FACILITIES AS

01:31:03.991 --> 01:31:04.992
BENEFICIAL LOW GROWTH. WE

01:31:05.059 --> 01:31:06.427
BELIEVE EVERY GIGAWATT OF NEW

01:31:06.494 --> 01:31:07.662
DEMAND CAN HELP LOWER RATES BY

01:31:07.728 --> 01:31:09.230
ABOUT 1%, WHILE INVESTING

01:31:09.297 --> 01:31:10.531
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:31:10.598 --> 01:31:12.266
IN TAX REVENUE AND HIGH TECH

01:31:12.333 --> 01:31:13.534
JOBS. WE'RE CURRENTLY SEEING

01:31:13.601 --> 01:31:14.936
SEVERAL GIGAWATTS OF POTENTIAL

01:31:15.002 --> 01:31:16.938
NEW DEMAND IN OUR CLUSTER STUDY,

01:31:17.004 --> 01:31:18.306
CUZ READY TO DEVELOP IN OUR

01:31:18.372 --> 01:31:19.407
SERVICE AREA. THIS IS LOAD THAT

01:31:19.473 --> 01:31:21.509
COULD EASILY RELOCATE TO NEVADA,

01:31:21.576 --> 01:31:23.411
TEXAS OR VIRGINIA. THIS IS SO

01:31:23.477 --> 01:31:25.546
THIS IS A VERY RARE OPPORTUNITY

01:31:25.613 --> 01:31:27.348
TO INVEST IN CALIFORNIA AND

01:31:27.415 --> 01:31:29.283
IMPROVE AFFORDABILITY. MANY OF

01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:31.319
THE CHALLENGES SB 57 AIMS TO

01:31:31.385 --> 01:31:33.054
ADDRESS ARE ALREADY BEING WORKED

01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:34.188
ON THROUGH EXISTING REGULATORY

01:31:34.255 --> 01:31:35.156
PROCESSES. FOR EXAMPLE, LAST

01:31:35.223 --> 01:31:36.424
YEAR WE SUBMITTED A PROPOSAL

01:31:36.490 --> 01:31:37.758
CALLED RULE 30, WHICH WOULD

01:31:37.825 --> 01:31:39.527
CREATE A NEW AGREEMENT FOR LARGE

01:31:39.594 --> 01:31:40.361
CUSTOMERS TO CONNECT TO THE

01:31:40.428 --> 01:31:42.029
TRANSMISSION GRID AND SHARE IN

01:31:42.096 --> 01:31:43.865
THE COSTS. JUST LAST WEEK, THE

01:31:43.931 --> 01:31:45.466
CPUC ISSUED A PROPOSED DECISION

01:31:45.533 --> 01:31:46.968
THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO BEGIN

01:31:47.034 --> 01:31:48.936
IMPLEMENTING THIS RULE ON AN

01:31:49.003 --> 01:31:49.503
INTERIM BASIS AND INCLUDES

01:31:49.570 --> 01:31:51.138
REQUIREMENTS FOR THOSE CUSTOMERS

01:31:51.205 --> 01:31:52.473
TO PRE-FUND NECESSARY GRID

01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:53.708
UPGRADES, AND IT MAY BE VOTED ON

01:31:53.774 --> 01:31:56.177
IN THE COMING WEEKS. ON ELECTRIC

01:31:56.244 --> 01:31:57.545
RATES. WE ALREADY HAVE A RATE

01:31:57.612 --> 01:31:59.447
STRUCTURE CALLED B 20 FOR

01:31:59.513 --> 01:32:01.249
CUSTOMERS USING MORE THAN ONE

01:32:01.315 --> 01:32:01.782
MEGAWATT, WHETHER THEY'RE

01:32:01.849 --> 01:32:02.984
CONNECTED TO TRANSMISSION OR THE

01:32:03.050 --> 01:32:04.619
DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. WE BELIEVE

01:32:04.685 --> 01:32:05.820
THIS RATE ADEQUATELY PROTECTS

01:32:05.887 --> 01:32:07.521
EXISTING CUSTOMERS, AND SINCE

01:32:07.588 --> 01:32:09.390
MOST OF THIS DEMAND WON'T COME

01:32:09.457 --> 01:32:10.358
ONLINE FOR A FEW YEARS, THERE'S

01:32:10.424 --> 01:32:11.859
SOME TIME TO REFINE OUR

01:32:11.926 --> 01:32:14.028
APPROACH. LAST MONTH, AS PART OF

01:32:14.095 --> 01:32:15.963
PHASE TWO OF OUR GENERAL RATE

01:32:16.030 --> 01:32:17.231
CASE, WE JOINED THE PUBLIC

01:32:17.298 --> 01:32:18.065
ADVOCATE'S OFFICE AND JOINTLY

01:32:18.132 --> 01:32:19.433
ASKING THE PUC TO CONSIDER

01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:21.335
WHETHER A NEW RATE SPECIFICALLY

01:32:21.402 --> 01:32:23.337
FOR LARGE CUSTOMERS IS NEEDED.

01:32:23.404 --> 01:32:24.338
THAT INCLUDES A DISCUSSION OF

01:32:24.405 --> 01:32:26.007
WHAT RATE DESIGN MEASURES WOULD

01:32:26.073 --> 01:32:27.008
BE IMPLEMENTED SIMILAR TO THIS

01:32:27.074 --> 01:32:30.177
BILL. BRIEFLY, ON GENERATION

01:32:30.244 --> 01:32:31.712
COSTS. WE'RE LOOKING TO THE IRP.

01:32:31.779 --> 01:32:33.147
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DATA SHARING

01:32:33.214 --> 01:32:34.916
WITH THE CCAS TO IMPROVE

01:32:34.982 --> 01:32:38.619
GENERATION. ALL THAT TO SAY,

01:32:38.686 --> 01:32:39.186
STAY AVAILABLE FOR TECHNICAL

01:32:39.253 --> 01:32:41.555
ASSISTANCE. THANK YOU. THANK

01:32:41.622 --> 01:32:43.524
YOU. CHAIR AND MEMBERS. BRUCE,

01:32:43.591 --> 01:32:44.592
ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:32:44.659 --> 01:32:46.794
LARGE ENERGY CONSUMERS

01:32:46.861 --> 01:32:49.063
ASSOCIATION, OUR MEMBERS ARE, IF

01:32:49.130 --> 01:32:51.799
YOU THINK ABOUT STEEL, CEMENT,

01:32:51.866 --> 01:32:54.235
INDUSTRIAL GASES, THEY USE

01:32:54.302 --> 01:32:55.836
ELECTRICITY IN A VERY LARGE

01:32:55.903 --> 01:32:58.706
SCALE. AMENDMENTS TO THE

01:32:58.773 --> 01:32:59.774
ORIGINAL BILL ON DATA CENTERS,

01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:02.543
WHICH WE'RE FOCUSING A LOT ON,

01:33:02.610 --> 01:33:04.812
ACTUALLY, THEN CAPTURED US

01:33:04.879 --> 01:33:06.247
POTENTIALLY WITHIN THE SCOPE OF

01:33:06.314 --> 01:33:08.482
THE BILL. I DO WANT TO GIVE THE

01:33:08.549 --> 01:33:11.452
SENATOR, HIS STAFF, COMMITTEE

01:33:11.519 --> 01:33:13.754
AND STAFF A LOT OF CREDIT FOR

01:33:13.821 --> 01:33:14.622
THEIR TRANSPARENCY AND OPENNESS

01:33:14.689 --> 01:33:17.425
TO HEAR OUR CONCERNS. WE HAVE A

01:33:17.491 --> 01:33:18.092
LOT OF REQUIREMENTS COMING

01:33:18.159 --> 01:33:20.394
TOWARDS US FOR DECARBONIZATION

01:33:20.461 --> 01:33:22.830
AND ELECTRIFICATION THAT ARE

01:33:22.897 --> 01:33:24.231
GOING TO BE MANDATED TO MEET THE

01:33:24.298 --> 01:33:27.068
GOALS OF AB 32. AND SO THE

01:33:27.134 --> 01:33:29.303
AUTHOR AND COMMITTEE STAFF, THE

01:33:29.370 --> 01:33:31.172
LATEST AMENDMENTS ADDRESS THOSE

01:33:31.238 --> 01:33:33.207
CONCERNS. BUT THERE ARE STILL

01:33:33.274 --> 01:33:35.743
ONE OUTSTANDING CONCERN. WE HAVE

01:33:35.810 --> 01:33:39.013
A MEMBER THAT IS ACTUALLY IN THE

01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:40.414
PROCESS OF CONSTRUCTING A STEEL

01:33:40.481 --> 01:33:42.483
MILL IN CALIFORNIA TO OPERATE IN

01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:45.086
AN ELECTRIC ARC FURNACE. AND IF

01:33:45.152 --> 01:33:46.454
YOU'D HAVE ASKED ME FIVE YEARS

01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:47.488
AGO, WOULD SOMEONE INVEST

01:33:47.555 --> 01:33:48.356
CAPITAL IN CALIFORNIA TO DO

01:33:48.422 --> 01:33:50.391
INDUSTRIAL MANUFACTURING, I

01:33:50.458 --> 01:33:52.660
WOULD HAVE SAID, ABSOLUTELY NOT.

01:33:52.727 --> 01:33:54.562
BUT THIS MEMBER OF CLIQUE IS IN

01:33:54.628 --> 01:33:56.364
THIS PROCESS. THEY'VE COMPLETED

01:33:56.430 --> 01:33:58.799
SEQUA. THEY HAVE STARTED THEIR

01:33:58.866 --> 01:34:00.968
LOAD SURVEY STUDY. THEY HAVE

01:34:01.035 --> 01:34:04.705
BROKEN GROUND. THE DATE FOR

01:34:04.772 --> 01:34:05.573
IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS BILL IS

01:34:05.639 --> 01:34:08.142
NOT ADEQUATE, IN THAT THEY MAY

01:34:08.209 --> 01:34:10.444
NOT HAVE A CONTRACT IN PLACE FOR

01:34:10.511 --> 01:34:11.812
SERVICE, SO THEY MIGHT BE

01:34:11.879 --> 01:34:13.581
CAPTURED BY THIS TARIFF. AND SO

01:34:13.647 --> 01:34:15.249
WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE SOME

01:34:15.316 --> 01:34:17.852
LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT WOULD

01:34:17.918 --> 01:34:19.220
EXCLUDE THEM FROM THE PROVISIONS

01:34:19.286 --> 01:34:20.221
OF THE BILL, SINCE THEY DID

01:34:20.287 --> 01:34:22.223
THEIR STUDIES AND THEIR

01:34:22.289 --> 01:34:24.358
INVESTMENT DECISIONS YEARS AGO.

01:34:24.425 --> 01:34:26.160
SO WITH THAT, I WOULD LOVE TO

THE COMMITTEE. QUESTIONS?

01:35:10.137 --> 01:35:12.039
COMMENTS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER IRWIN.

01:35:12.106 --> 01:35:13.407
YEAH, MAYBE I MISSED THIS

01:35:13.474 --> 01:35:15.109
BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME

01:35:15.176 --> 01:35:17.945
CHANGES MADE TO THE BILL. SO

01:35:18.012 --> 01:35:19.447
INITIALLY I THOUGHT THE BILL WAS

01:35:19.513 --> 01:35:22.283
ABOUT DATA CENTERS. SO DID YOU

01:35:22.349 --> 01:35:25.186
MEAN TO CAPTURE NEW

01:35:25.252 --> 01:35:28.556
MANUFACTURING AND POTENTIALLY

01:35:28.622 --> 01:35:30.558
INDUSTRY THAT IS TRYING TO

01:35:30.624 --> 01:35:33.260
UTILIZE CARBON CAPTURE? MADAM

01:35:33.327 --> 01:35:34.361
CHAIR, ASSEMBLYMEMBER, THANK YOU

01:35:34.428 --> 01:35:36.363
FOR THE QUESTION. THE INTENT IS

01:35:36.430 --> 01:35:38.099
NOT TO BE OVERLY BROAD. THE

01:35:38.165 --> 01:35:40.367
INTENT IS TO DEAL WITH LARGE

01:35:40.434 --> 01:35:41.769
CONSUMERS THAT PUT SUDDEN DEMAND

01:35:41.836 --> 01:35:43.571
ON THE GRID. THERE WAS SOME

01:35:43.637 --> 01:35:45.106
OBJECTION TO SPECIFYING DATA

01:35:45.172 --> 01:35:46.807
CENTERS. DATA CENTERS IS THE

01:35:46.874 --> 01:35:48.209
OBVIOUS NEAR-TERM INDUSTRIAL

01:35:48.275 --> 01:35:49.343
DEVELOPMENT THAT IS

01:35:49.410 --> 01:35:50.411
PROLIFERATING AS WE SPEAK, AND

01:35:50.478 --> 01:35:53.581
IS ACTUALLY PROVING THE CONCEPT.

01:35:53.647 --> 01:35:55.716
BUT WE WERE WE WILL CONTINUE TO

01:35:55.783 --> 01:35:57.451
WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND LOOK

01:35:57.518 --> 01:35:59.487
AT REFINING THE DEFINITIONS IN

01:35:59.553 --> 01:36:01.288
TERMS OF APPLICABILITY. BUT THE

01:36:01.355 --> 01:36:02.723
INTENT OF THE LANGUAGE IS TO

01:36:02.790 --> 01:36:05.826
CAPTURE IS TO AVOID CALLING OUT

01:36:05.893 --> 01:36:07.128
DATA CENTERS ALONE SPECIFICALLY,

01:36:07.194 --> 01:36:09.563
BUT TO DEAL WITH THOSE WHO PUT A

01:36:09.630 --> 01:36:10.564
SUDDEN MASSIVE DEMAND ON THE

01:36:10.631 --> 01:36:14.034
GRID. BUT YOU BUT YOU COULD HAVE

01:36:14.101 --> 01:36:16.003
YOU COULD HAVE AN INDUSTRY THAT

01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:18.139
WANTS TO ADD CARBON CAPTURE,

01:36:18.205 --> 01:36:19.640
WHICH WOULD DEFINITELY HAVE AN

01:36:19.707 --> 01:36:21.475
OFFSETTING BENEFIT. YES. YEAH.

01:36:21.542 --> 01:36:23.277
AND I AND MADAM CHAIR MEMBER, I

01:36:23.344 --> 01:36:24.712
HEAR THAT CONCERN. AND AS I

01:36:24.778 --> 01:36:25.846
INDICATED, I'M WILLING TO

01:36:25.913 --> 01:36:27.615
CONTINUE TO CONTINUE TO WORK

01:36:27.681 --> 01:36:28.983
THAT ISSUE. THANK YOU. AND

01:36:29.049 --> 01:36:31.285
AGAIN, JUST FOR THE CLARITY OF

01:36:31.352 --> 01:36:33.420
THE COMMITTEE, THE AMENDMENT

01:36:33.487 --> 01:36:35.422
THAT EXPANDED THE SCOPE OF THE

01:36:35.489 --> 01:36:37.525
BILL BEYOND DATA CENTERS TO

01:36:37.591 --> 01:36:40.127
INCLUDE ALL SORT OF LARGE SCALE

01:36:40.194 --> 01:36:41.896
USERS, THAT DID NOT HAPPEN HERE.

01:36:41.962 --> 01:36:42.463
THAT WAS AN AMENDMENT THAT

01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:45.466
HAPPENED IN THE SENATE. SO THAT

01:36:45.533 --> 01:36:50.905
IS HOW THE BILL ARRIVED TO US.

01:36:50.971 --> 01:36:52.706
ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S THANK YOU,

01:36:52.773 --> 01:36:54.942
SENATOR. NICE TO SEE YOU. SO I

01:36:55.009 --> 01:36:56.977
THINK THE YOU KNOW, IT'S A GOOD

01:36:57.044 --> 01:36:59.180
THING, I THINK, TO GET AHEAD OF

01:36:59.246 --> 01:37:00.247
WE'RE NOT EVEN AHEAD. I GUESS

01:37:00.314 --> 01:37:02.049
WE'RE SORT OF PLAYING RUNNING

01:37:02.116 --> 01:37:04.552
ALONG WITH THE GROWTH IN THESE

01:37:04.618 --> 01:37:05.419
DATA CENTERS AND THE ENERGY

01:37:05.486 --> 01:37:08.189
NEEDS THAT THEY ARE REQUIRING OF

01:37:08.255 --> 01:37:11.292
US. COUPLE THINGS ON THE DETAILS

01:37:11.358 --> 01:37:13.294
OF THE BILL THAT I JUST DON'T

01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:15.462
KNOW IF THEY'VE CHANGED OR NOT.

01:37:15.529 --> 01:37:17.531
ONE OF THE OPPONENTS RAISED THE

01:37:17.598 --> 01:37:21.936
ISSUE THAT THE. THAT THE

01:37:22.002 --> 01:37:23.270
IMPLEMENTATION DATE WAS

01:37:23.337 --> 01:37:26.273
UNREALISTIC IN A YEAR OUT. IS

01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:31.412
THAT JUST KNOWING PUC. TIMELINES

01:37:31.478 --> 01:37:34.148
THAT SEEMED TO BE A REASONABLE

01:37:34.215 --> 01:37:35.916
COMMENT. I JUST WONDER IF YOU

01:37:35.983 --> 01:37:37.284
WANT TO SPEAK TO THAT. IF THAT

01:37:37.351 --> 01:37:39.253
WAS IF YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THAT,

01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:40.254
MADAM CHAIR MEMBER AND I'LL GIVE

01:37:40.321 --> 01:37:41.388
MY EXPERT HERE OPPORTUNITY AS

01:37:41.455 --> 01:37:43.624
WELL. I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE LACK

01:37:43.691 --> 01:37:45.826
OF TIMELINESS ON THE PART OF THE

01:37:45.893 --> 01:37:46.794
PUC, AND I WOULDN'T DISPUTE THE

01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:47.494
UNDERLYING ASSERTION THAT THAT

01:37:47.561 --> 01:37:51.031
MAY BE A QUESTION. ASSEMBLY

01:37:51.098 --> 01:37:52.833
MEMBER, I'LL JUST NOTE THAT THE

01:37:52.900 --> 01:37:55.869
BILL IN PRINT HAS THE DATE JULY

01:37:55.936 --> 01:37:58.472
1ST, 2026, BUT THE COMMITTEE

01:37:58.539 --> 01:38:00.908
AMENDMENTS WOULD PUSH THAT DATE

01:38:00.975 --> 01:38:03.677
TO DECEMBER 31ST, 2026. SO

01:38:03.744 --> 01:38:05.145
ADDING APPROXIMATELY ANOTHER SIX

01:38:05.212 --> 01:38:07.948
MONTHS TO IMPLEMENTATION. WE

01:38:08.015 --> 01:38:09.783
THINK THAT'S REASONABLE. IT

01:38:09.850 --> 01:38:11.285
DIRECTS THE PUC TO GET THIS

01:38:11.352 --> 01:38:13.487
PROCESS GOING QUICKLY, AND WE

01:38:13.554 --> 01:38:14.855
THINK THAT IT'S AN ACHIEVABLE

01:38:14.922 --> 01:38:16.857
TIME FRAME GIVEN THE PUC

01:38:16.924 --> 01:38:18.025
PROCESS, AND WE WOULD BE

01:38:18.092 --> 01:38:19.660
CONCERNED THAT PUSHING THE DATE

01:38:19.727 --> 01:38:21.061
SIGNIFICANTLY BACK SENDS THE

01:38:21.128 --> 01:38:22.663
WRONG SIGNAL TO THE COMMISSION.

01:38:22.730 --> 01:38:23.631
THAT SIGNAL WOULD BE YOU DON'T

01:38:23.697 --> 01:38:26.000
HAVE TO FRONT LOAD THIS, PUT IT

01:38:26.066 --> 01:38:27.468
ON THE BACK BURNER. AND THEN THE

01:38:27.534 --> 01:38:30.170
OTHER THERE WERE SOME OTHER TO

01:38:30.237 --> 01:38:32.072
ME SOUNDED LIKE SOME

01:38:32.139 --> 01:38:33.107
IMPLEMENTATION THINGS THAT WERE

01:38:33.173 --> 01:38:35.376
IN THE PG AND E LETTER THAT I'M

01:38:35.442 --> 01:38:37.611
JUST WONDERING IF YOU IT SOUNDS

01:38:37.678 --> 01:38:42.650
TO ME LIKE. YOU KNOW, THE

01:38:42.716 --> 01:38:43.384
OUTCOME OF THE BILL, WHICH I

01:38:43.450 --> 01:38:46.020
THINK IS A GOOD THING, COULD

01:38:46.086 --> 01:38:46.987
ACTUALLY DISRUPT SOME. IT SEEMED

01:38:47.054 --> 01:38:48.322
LIKE THEY HAD SOME REASONABLE

01:38:48.389 --> 01:38:50.224
COMMENTS RELATED TO THE

01:38:50.291 --> 01:38:51.925
ELIGIBILITY DEFINITIONS AND WHAT

01:38:51.992 --> 01:38:54.395
YOU WERE CAPTURING. I WAS JUST

01:38:54.461 --> 01:38:55.429
WONDERING IF YOU'VE ACTUALLY

01:38:55.496 --> 01:38:56.897
WORKED WITH THEM ALREADY ON

01:38:56.964 --> 01:38:58.799
THOSE DEFINITIONAL PIECES OR

01:38:58.866 --> 01:38:59.366
NOT, AND WHETHER YOU THOUGHT

01:38:59.433 --> 01:39:01.568
THEY WERE REASONABLE. I THINK,

01:39:01.635 --> 01:39:02.303
MADAM CHAIR, AND MEMBERS, I

01:39:02.369 --> 01:39:04.171
WOULD PROBABLY PARTLY REJECT THE

01:39:04.238 --> 01:39:06.307
PREMISE THAT WE WOULD

01:39:06.373 --> 01:39:08.042
PERSPECTIVE PROPOSED DECISION ON

01:39:08.108 --> 01:39:09.343
THE RULEMAKING, ON THE QUESTION

01:39:09.410 --> 01:39:12.279
OF THE SUBMITTAL ON 30, THAT

01:39:12.346 --> 01:39:13.480
STATUTORY LANGUAGE WOULD DO

01:39:13.547 --> 01:39:17.184
ANYTHING OTHER THAN PREEMPT

01:39:17.251 --> 01:39:18.085
APPROPRIATELY, AS WOULD ANY

01:39:18.152 --> 01:39:19.887
STATUTORY DIRECTIVE TO THE PUC.

01:39:19.953 --> 01:39:21.755
SO I DON'T SEE THAT AS A REAL

01:39:21.822 --> 01:39:23.524
ISSUE IN TERMS OF THE PROPOSED

01:39:23.590 --> 01:39:24.425
RULE OR THE PROPOSED DECISION ON

01:39:24.491 --> 01:39:26.760
THE RULE. AND AGAIN, WE ARE IN

01:39:26.827 --> 01:39:28.095
THE RULEMAKING PROCESS WITH

01:39:28.162 --> 01:39:29.363
RESPECT TO SOME OF THE DETAILS

01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:31.198
LAID OUT IN THE RULEMAKING THAT

01:39:31.265 --> 01:39:34.134
ARE PROSPECTIVE AND PRELIMINARY

01:39:34.201 --> 01:39:35.069
AND PROPOSED. AND AS THOSE OF US

01:39:35.135 --> 01:39:36.570
WHO'VE EVER PRACTICED OR WORKED

01:39:36.637 --> 01:39:38.305
WITH THE PUC, WE KNOW THAT THAT

01:39:38.372 --> 01:39:40.007
ISN'T ALWAYS A GUARANTEE OF WHAT

01:39:40.074 --> 01:39:41.608
THE FINAL OUTCOME LOOKS LIKE.

01:39:41.675 --> 01:39:43.010
AND THAT'S WHY A STATUTORY

01:39:43.077 --> 01:39:44.011
APPROACH WE BELIEVE IS

01:39:44.078 --> 01:39:45.713
APPROPRIATE. I DON'T I DON'T

01:39:45.779 --> 01:39:47.314
DISPUTE A STATUTORY PROVISION IS

01:39:47.381 --> 01:39:49.350
APPROPRIATE. WHAT I'M COMMENTING

01:39:49.416 --> 01:39:51.685
ON IS THEIR WHAT THEY'RE SAYING.

01:39:51.752 --> 01:39:54.788
I THINK IN SOME IN YOUR

01:39:54.855 --> 01:39:55.356
DEFINITION ON THE ELIGIBLE

01:39:55.422 --> 01:39:55.989
CUSTOMERS, THEY'RE THINKING THAT

01:39:56.056 --> 01:39:59.560
IT MAY BE TOO NARROW OR OR

01:39:59.626 --> 01:40:01.895
PRESCRIPTIVE. AND YOU MAY IT MAY

01:40:01.962 --> 01:40:03.097
HAVE SOME UNINTENDED

01:40:03.163 --> 01:40:04.565
CONSEQUENCES. SO I'M JUST HOPING

01:40:04.631 --> 01:40:07.634
THAT YOU'LL UNDERSTAND THOSE AND

01:40:07.701 --> 01:40:08.836
TAKE THEM INTO ACCOUNT AS THE

01:40:08.902 --> 01:40:10.771
BILL MOVES FORWARD. YEAH, I

01:40:10.838 --> 01:40:12.139
WASN'T SORT OF SAYING THAT THE

01:40:12.206 --> 01:40:13.440
STATUTE SHOULDN'T DEFINE IT. I

01:40:13.507 --> 01:40:15.743
JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT

01:40:15.809 --> 01:40:17.745
YOU DO IS HAS THE RIGHT HAS THE

01:40:17.811 --> 01:40:19.713
RIGHT OUTCOME. NO APOLOGIES.

01:40:19.780 --> 01:40:20.347
ASSEMBLY MEMBER, I MISUNDERSTOOD

01:40:20.414 --> 01:40:21.949
YOU TO RAISE A CONCERN ABOUT A

01:40:22.015 --> 01:40:23.584
CONFLICT BETWEEN WHAT ULTIMATELY

01:40:23.650 --> 01:40:25.285
ENDS UP IN THE FINAL RULEMAKING

01:40:25.352 --> 01:40:26.353
DECISION AND WHAT'S BEING

01:40:26.420 --> 01:40:27.855
PRESCRIBED IN STATUTE, AND

01:40:27.921 --> 01:40:29.423
CREATING UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE

01:40:29.490 --> 01:40:30.758
AROUND THAT. WITH RESPECT TO

01:40:30.824 --> 01:40:32.726
YOUR COMMENT ABOUT, YOU KNOW,

01:40:32.793 --> 01:40:33.560
CONTINUING TO REFINE THE

01:40:33.627 --> 01:40:35.596
DEFINITIONS ON ON ITS FACE,

01:40:35.662 --> 01:40:37.464
ABSOLUTELY. GREAT. THANK YOU.

01:40:37.531 --> 01:40:42.035
YEAH. ALL RIGHT. SEEING NO OTHER

01:40:42.102 --> 01:40:44.071
MEMBERS WISHING TO ASK A

01:40:44.138 --> 01:40:45.305
QUESTION, I'LL JUST, I GUESS,

01:40:45.372 --> 01:40:47.241
SORT OF SHARE A COMMENT AND SORT

01:40:47.307 --> 01:40:48.909
OF THE WAY THAT I'M

01:40:48.976 --> 01:40:49.576
CONCEPTUALIZING THIS BILL. SO I

01:40:49.643 --> 01:40:52.379
THINK THERE ARE SORT OF TWO

01:40:52.446 --> 01:40:53.380
POTENTIAL RISKS THAT YOU'RE

01:40:53.447 --> 01:40:56.383
TRYING TO ADDRESS. THE FIRST IS

01:40:56.450 --> 01:40:58.485
A RISK OF STRANDED ASSETS. AND

01:40:58.552 --> 01:41:01.021
THERE ARE EXAMPLES IN OTHER

01:41:01.088 --> 01:41:03.524
STATES WHERE YOU'VE HAD, YOU

01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:05.259
KNOW, POTENTIAL LARGE LOAD

01:41:05.325 --> 01:41:07.094
CUSTOMERS KIND OF RATE SHOPPING

01:41:07.161 --> 01:41:09.229
BETWEEN STATES, AND THEY GET

01:41:09.296 --> 01:41:11.098
COMMITMENTS FROM UTILITY TO MAKE

01:41:11.165 --> 01:41:13.300
HUGE INVESTMENTS AND THEN DECIDE

01:41:13.367 --> 01:41:14.668
TO SET UP SHOP SOMEWHERE ELSE.

01:41:14.735 --> 01:41:16.804
SO, YOU KNOW, REALLY APPRECIATE

01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:18.205
YOU THINKING THROUGH A WAY IN

01:41:18.272 --> 01:41:19.973
WHICH WE GET IN FRONT OF THAT

01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:21.809
POTENTIAL RISK. I THINK THAT'S

01:41:21.875 --> 01:41:23.544
IMPORTANT. I THINK THERE'S THE

01:41:23.610 --> 01:41:26.613
OTHER POTENTIAL RISK, AND I

01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:28.749
CONSIDER IT AN OPEN QUESTION

01:41:28.816 --> 01:41:32.619
AROUND A COST SHIFT. SO AS YOU

01:41:32.686 --> 01:41:34.388
HEARD FROM OUR IOU

01:41:34.455 --> 01:41:36.623
REPRESENTATIVE, THERE'S THIS

01:41:36.690 --> 01:41:37.991
CONCEPT THAT ACTUALLY THERE'S

01:41:38.058 --> 01:41:39.460
BENEFICIAL LOAD GROWTH. AND THAT

01:41:39.526 --> 01:41:41.228
LOAD GROWTH ACTUALLY ENDS UP

01:41:41.295 --> 01:41:43.130
LOWERING RATES FOR ALL OF US.

01:41:43.197 --> 01:41:45.232
AND SO THAT'S WHY I'D SAY THE

01:41:45.299 --> 01:41:46.834
BILL IS AMENDED. IN MY VIEW, IT

01:41:46.900 --> 01:41:49.236
DOES NOT PRESUME SOME SORT OF

01:41:49.303 --> 01:41:50.737
PUNITIVE APPROACH. THE FIRST

01:41:50.804 --> 01:41:54.908
STEP IS TO REALLY ASK THE CPUC

01:41:54.975 --> 01:41:57.211
TO ASSESS THE, YOU KNOW, WHETHER

01:41:57.277 --> 01:41:59.446
OR NOT THERE IS A COST SHIFT

01:41:59.513 --> 01:42:00.981
IMPLICATION TO THESE LARGE LOAD

01:42:01.048 --> 01:42:03.851
CUSTOMERS. AND I THINK THAT THAT

01:42:03.917 --> 01:42:04.318
IS REALLY GOING TO BE

01:42:04.384 --> 01:42:05.752
FOUNDATIONALLY IMPORTANT AS WE

01:42:05.819 --> 01:42:07.454
CRAFT POLICY AND APPROACHES AS

01:42:07.521 --> 01:42:09.590
WE MOVE FORWARD. SO WITH THAT,

01:42:09.656 --> 01:42:11.458
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE? THANK

01:42:11.525 --> 01:42:12.826
YOU, MADAM CHAIR. AND I WOULD

01:42:12.893 --> 01:42:14.761
ADD AN ADDITIONAL THANKS FOR

01:42:14.828 --> 01:42:15.796
PARTIALLY CONTRIBUTING TO MY

01:42:15.863 --> 01:42:17.231
CLOSING REMARKS. I APPRECIATE

01:42:17.297 --> 01:42:18.999
THAT WITH WITH RESPECT TO THE

01:42:19.066 --> 01:42:20.367
ASSESSMENT PROVISIONS AND WITH

01:42:20.434 --> 01:42:21.702
RESPECT WITH THE MODIFICATIONS

01:42:21.768 --> 01:42:23.337
AND THE LANGUAGE DEALING WITH

01:42:23.403 --> 01:42:25.472
DISTRIBUTED STORAGE ON SITE TO

01:42:25.539 --> 01:42:28.408
PROVIDE BACKUP AND THE ABILITY

01:42:28.475 --> 01:42:29.810
TO ENCOURAGE THE USE OF

01:42:29.877 --> 01:42:30.944
RENEWABLES THERE. THAT'S A

01:42:31.011 --> 01:42:32.446
CHANGE IN THE LANGUAGE AS WELL.

01:42:32.513 --> 01:42:33.447
SO THOSE TWO THINGS WERE

01:42:33.514 --> 01:42:35.349
IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT. I

01:42:35.415 --> 01:42:36.316
APPRECIATE YOU POINTING THEM

01:42:36.383 --> 01:42:37.784
OUT. AND WITH THAT, I WOULD VERY

01:42:37.851 --> 01:42:39.186

USING STRATEGIC, COST EFFECTIVE

01:44:50.217 --> 01:44:52.352
METHODS. OVER THE PAST DECADE,

01:44:52.419 --> 01:44:53.920
CALIFORNIA'S WILDFIRES HAVE

01:44:53.987 --> 01:44:58.291
DESTROYED 50 53,970 STRUCTURES

01:44:58.358 --> 01:45:01.495

01:45:34.828 --> 01:45:36.263
THE LEGISLATURE HAS STRENGTHENED

01:45:36.329 --> 01:45:37.698
OVERSIGHT OF ELECTRICAL

01:45:49.710 --> 01:45:51.445
HOWEVER, THE RECENT WILDFIRES

01:45:51.511 --> 01:45:53.280
REVEALED GAPS IN OUR STATE'S

01:45:53.346 --> 01:45:55.449
MITIGATION EFFORTS. ALTADENA, IN

01:45:55.515 --> 01:45:57.718

EATON FIRE UNDERSCORES THE

01:46:02.956 --> 01:46:05.392
URGENT NEED TO RETHINK HOW WE

01:46:05.459 --> 01:46:07.661

01:49:11.878 --> 01:49:13.747
APPROPRIATE TIME, I RESPECTFULLY

01:49:13.813 --> 01:49:17.450
ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. MADAM CHAIR.

01:49:17.517 --> 01:49:20.620
THANK YOU. AS OFTEN IS THE CASE

01:49:20.687 --> 01:49:23.690
LATELY, I KIND OF THROW OUT WHAT

01:49:23.757 --> 01:49:24.324
I WAS ABOUT TO SAY, AND I SPEAK

01:49:24.391 --> 01:49:26.526
A LITTLE OFF THE CUFF TO YOUR

01:49:26.593 --> 01:49:27.227
ADVANTAGE. I TEND TO LEAVE

01:49:27.294 --> 01:49:29.629
THINGS OUT, NOT SAY TOO MUCH. SO

01:49:29.696 --> 01:49:30.630
YOU'VE LAID IT OUT WELL,

01:49:30.697 --> 01:49:32.999
SENATOR, I AM A COUNCIL MEMBER

01:49:33.066 --> 01:49:34.634
IN ALTADENA. I'M ALSO THE CHAIR

01:49:34.701 --> 01:49:37.103
OF THE ACOMA, WHICH IS ALTADENA

01:49:37.170 --> 01:49:38.905
COALITION OF NEIGHBORHOOD

01:49:38.972 --> 01:49:40.507
ASSOCIATIONS. I'M THE CHAIR OF

01:49:40.573 --> 01:49:41.942
OUR COMMUNICATION COMMITTEE. I'M

01:49:42.008 --> 01:49:44.444
A FATHER. I RAN THE THEATER

01:49:44.511 --> 01:49:45.879
PROGRAM AT MY KIDS SCHOOL. THIS

01:49:45.946 --> 01:49:47.314
IS ALL TO SAY THAT I FEEL LIKE

01:49:47.380 --> 01:49:49.049
I'M ENTRENCHED IN THE COMMUNITY,

01:49:49.115 --> 01:49:51.484
AND I CAN GIVE YOU A KIND OF A

01:49:51.551 --> 01:49:53.420
HUMAN LOOK AT WHAT ALTADENA WAS

01:49:53.486 --> 01:49:54.220
THROUGH. AND THE REASON I'M

01:49:54.287 --> 01:49:55.922
DOING THAT, I THINK IT'S A VALID

01:49:55.989 --> 01:49:57.257
POINT TO THINK ABOUT INVESTMENT

01:49:57.324 --> 01:49:59.592
IN CALIFORNIA, AND IT'S

01:49:59.659 --> 01:50:01.328
CERTAINLY VALID TO MAKE SURE WE

01:50:01.394 --> 01:50:03.196
KEEP AFLOAT. BUT I WOULD ARGUE

01:50:03.263 --> 01:50:04.597
WHAT'S THE BIGGEST INVESTMENT IS

01:50:04.664 --> 01:50:06.466
THE INVESTMENT IN THE PEOPLE AND

01:50:06.533 --> 01:50:08.401
THE INVESTMENT IN OUR SAFETY.

01:50:08.468 --> 01:50:10.036
AND WE CAN SET STANDARDS THAT GO

01:50:10.103 --> 01:50:12.172
FAR BEYOND JUST BRINGING PEOPLE

01:50:12.238 --> 01:50:14.007
INTO CALIFORNIA TO PUT THEIR

01:50:14.074 --> 01:50:16.042
MONEY INTO CALIFORNIA. NOT A BIG

01:50:16.109 --> 01:50:17.310
CONCERN OF MINE, BECAUSE I'M ONE

01:50:17.377 --> 01:50:18.578
OF THE PEOPLE THAT LOST

01:50:18.645 --> 01:50:20.447
EVERYTHING. MY CHILDREN LOST

01:50:20.513 --> 01:50:22.349
THEIR CHILDHOOD HOME, THEY LOST

01:50:22.415 --> 01:50:24.451
THEIR SCHOOL. WE LOST OUR

01:50:24.517 --> 01:50:26.186
CHURCH. MY DAUGHTER WAS COMING

01:50:26.252 --> 01:50:27.487
OUT OF A DEPRESSION THROUGH

01:50:27.554 --> 01:50:28.488
COVID. I MENTION ALL THIS

01:50:28.555 --> 01:50:30.523
BECAUSE THERE ARE 6000 STORIES

01:50:30.590 --> 01:50:32.726
LIKE MINE. OUT OF THAT

01:50:32.792 --> 01:50:34.194
DEPRESSION, SHE CREATED A SAFE

01:50:34.260 --> 01:50:36.363
SPACE. SHE LOST THAT SPACE. SHE

01:50:36.429 --> 01:50:38.498
LOST THOSE NEIGHBORS. WE'RE IN A

01:50:38.565 --> 01:50:39.232
STRANGE NEIGHBORHOOD NOW. WE

01:50:39.299 --> 01:50:41.134
WON'T BE ABLE TO BUILD BACK THE

01:50:41.201 --> 01:50:43.103
WAY WE WANTED TO BUILD BACK. SO

01:50:43.169 --> 01:50:44.904
EVEN THOUGH MY MARINE SON IS

01:50:44.971 --> 01:50:47.440
GONE, HE HAD ALL OF HIS

01:50:47.507 --> 01:50:48.942
TREASURED BELONGINGS KEPT AT OUR

01:50:49.009 --> 01:50:50.410
HOUSE. IF YOU ARE MILITARY LIKE

01:50:50.477 --> 01:50:52.045
OUR FAMILY, YOU KNOW THAT YOU

01:50:52.112 --> 01:50:53.546
DON'T DRAG EVERYTHING WITH YOU.

01:50:53.613 --> 01:50:55.682
HE LOST EVERYTHING. HE LOST

01:50:55.749 --> 01:50:57.484
MEDALS, HE LOST COMMENDATIONS.

01:50:57.550 --> 01:50:59.352
MY OLDEST SON LOST ALL OF HIS

01:50:59.419 --> 01:51:01.354
ARTWORK AS HE'S IN HIS FINISHING

01:51:01.421 --> 01:51:04.457
YEARS OF ART SCHOOL, THE LOSS IS

01:51:04.524 --> 01:51:05.725
OVERWHELMING. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT

01:51:05.792 --> 01:51:08.328
THAT TOWER THAT WAS LEFT FOR 50

01:51:08.395 --> 01:51:10.764
YEARS, THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL

01:51:10.830 --> 01:51:12.932
SPEAKS TO ME HIGHEST ABOUT TO

01:51:12.999 --> 01:51:15.869
HAVE ANY SORT OF BILL WITH BITE

01:51:15.935 --> 01:51:17.237
THAT CAN ACTUALLY FORCE PEOPLE

01:51:17.303 --> 01:51:20.306
TO TAKE AWAY A HAZARD LIKE THAT,

01:51:20.373 --> 01:51:23.410
WHICH UNDOUBTEDLY HAD TO DO WITH

01:51:23.476 --> 01:51:25.945
THE FIRE. I JUST STRONGLY

01:51:26.012 --> 01:51:27.414
SUPPORT THIS BILL, AND I HOPE

01:51:27.480 --> 01:51:29.482
YOU DO AS WELL. THANK YOU.

01:51:29.549 --> 01:51:31.217
COUNCIL MEMBER. WE APPRECIATE

01:51:31.284 --> 01:51:33.420
YOU BEING HERE TO JOIN US TODAY.

01:51:33.486 --> 01:51:34.587
WITH THAT, WE'LL GO AHEAD AND

01:51:34.654 --> 01:51:36.389
OPEN IT UP FOR ADDITIONAL

01:51:36.456 --> 01:51:37.390
TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT. IF YOU'D

01:51:37.457 --> 01:51:40.326
LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB

01:51:40.393 --> 01:51:42.395

CAN GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO OUR

01:51:55.742 --> 01:51:56.876
OPPOSITION WITNESSES. IF YOU'D

01:51:56.943 --> 01:51:59.779
LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION.

01:51:59.846 --> 01:52:01.881
IF YOU'RE A PRIMARY WITNESS,

01:52:01.948 --> 01:52:09.489
COME ON UP. THANK YOU, MADAM

01:52:09.556 --> 01:52:10.857
CHAIR. AND MEMBERS. JOSE WITH

01:52:10.924 --> 01:52:13.026
SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC. I

01:52:13.093 --> 01:52:14.527
WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE

01:52:14.594 --> 01:52:15.895
SENATOR, HER STAFF AND THE

01:52:15.962 --> 01:52:18.364
COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK ON THE

01:52:18.431 --> 01:52:19.365
BILL, ESPECIALLY THE REMOVAL OF

01:52:19.432 --> 01:52:22.535
THE 5 BILLION RETURN ON EQUITY

01:52:22.602 --> 01:52:23.903
RESTRICTION, WHICH WAS A BIG

01:52:23.970 --> 01:52:26.940
DEAL FOR US. WE DO STILL HAVE

01:52:27.006 --> 01:52:29.342
SOME CONCERNS. WE'RE TRYING TO

01:52:29.409 --> 01:52:31.044
GO THROUGH THE AMENDMENTS AND

01:52:31.111 --> 01:52:32.078
UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT THEY DO,

01:52:32.145 --> 01:52:33.947
BUT WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:52:34.013 --> 01:52:36.049
THAT THERE ARE NO REDUNDANCIES

01:52:36.116 --> 01:52:39.385
TO CURRENT PROCESSES. WE JUST WE

01:52:39.452 --> 01:52:41.955
DON'T WANT UTILITIES TO HAVE TO

01:52:42.021 --> 01:52:42.856
RECREATE WORK THAT'S DONE

01:52:42.922 --> 01:52:44.424
THROUGH DETAILED AND SEPARATE

01:52:44.491 --> 01:52:45.592
EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PLANS,

01:52:45.658 --> 01:52:47.360
WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLANS AND

01:52:47.427 --> 01:52:50.430
PSPS PROGRAM PLANS, REQUIRING US

01:52:50.497 --> 01:52:52.765
TO COMPLY WITH NEW MANDATES FROM

01:52:52.832 --> 01:52:54.567
MULTIPLE AGENCIES WILL

01:52:54.634 --> 01:52:56.202
ULTIMATELY CAUSE CONFUSION AND

01:52:56.269 --> 01:52:57.737
INEFFICIENCY AND REAL RISK OF

01:52:57.804 --> 01:52:59.506
OPERATIONAL BREAKDOWNS DURING

01:52:59.572 --> 01:53:01.241
EMERGENCIES, AND THEN

01:53:01.307 --> 01:53:03.543
SECONDARILY, OTHER CONCERN THAT

01:53:03.610 --> 01:53:06.646
WE THAT WE STILL HAVE, YOU KNOW,

01:53:06.713 --> 01:53:07.881
WITHOUT SEEING THE AMENDMENTS IN

01:53:07.947 --> 01:53:11.151
PRINT YET, IS THAT THE BILL

01:53:11.217 --> 01:53:13.086
STILL REQUIRES THE PUBLIC

01:53:13.153 --> 01:53:14.287
DISCLOSURE OF DETAILED

01:53:14.354 --> 01:53:15.455

LOCATIONS, CONDITIONS AND

01:53:18.992 --> 01:53:20.727
VULNERABILITIES. THE CPUC HAS

01:53:20.793 --> 01:53:22.228
WARNED THAT DISCLOSING THIS KIND

01:53:22.295 --> 01:53:23.730
OF DATA COULD ALLOW BAD ACTORS

01:53:23.796 --> 01:53:25.465
TO ATTACK CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY

01:53:25.532 --> 01:53:27.467
INFRASTRUCTURE. WE DON'T HAVE

01:53:27.534 --> 01:53:30.603
ISSUES WITH, YOU KNOW, A PLAN TO

01:53:30.670 --> 01:53:31.871
REMOVE IDLE, ABANDONED LINES.

01:53:31.938 --> 01:53:33.673
JUST POSTING THAT INFORMATION

01:53:33.740 --> 01:53:35.141
PUBLICLY IS A SAFETY CONCERN FOR

01:53:35.208 --> 01:53:38.044
US. AND JUST TO BE CLEAR, WE'RE

01:53:38.111 --> 01:53:39.812
NOT AGAINST IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR

01:53:39.879 --> 01:53:42.448
PSPS OPERATIONS AND PLANS. WE'VE

01:53:42.515 --> 01:53:44.551
THIS HAS BEEN A ITERATIVE

01:53:44.617 --> 01:53:45.952
PROCESS THROUGHOUT THE YEARS. I

01:53:46.019 --> 01:53:48.421

01:53:48.488 --> 01:53:50.757
STARTED YEARS AGO, OUR OUR POST

01:53:52.225 --> 01:53:53.960
AND THE MOST RECENT ONE WAS OVER

01:53:54.027 --> 01:53:55.495
100 PAGES. SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING

01:53:55.562 --> 01:53:57.897
AND WE LEARNED FROM EACH

01:53:57.964 --> 01:53:59.799

01:54:51.417 --> 01:54:52.919
THE CONCERN THAT THEY'RE RAISING

01:54:52.986 --> 01:54:56.122
IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT WE

01:54:56.189 --> 01:54:57.657
DON'T HAVE BAD ACTORS THAT ARE

01:54:57.724 --> 01:54:59.392
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF FIGURING OUT

01:54:59.459 --> 01:55:00.793
WHERE THESE DECOMMISSION LINES

01:55:00.860 --> 01:55:02.195
ARE. YOU KNOW, I THINK OUR

01:55:02.262 --> 01:55:04.063
OFFICE IS VERY OPEN TO

01:55:04.130 --> 01:55:05.898
CONTINUING TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS

01:55:05.965 --> 01:55:08.368
AROUND HOW WE HOW WE HANDLE

01:55:08.434 --> 01:55:10.703
THAT. I THINK WE NEED TO

01:55:10.770 --> 01:55:11.838
COMMUNICATE AND JUST UNDERSTAND

01:55:11.904 --> 01:55:13.873
WITH THE CPUC WHAT KIND OF

01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:15.608
PROTOCOLS THAT THEY HAVE IN

01:55:15.675 --> 01:55:17.176
PLACE CURRENTLY TO SAFEGUARD

01:55:17.243 --> 01:55:19.112
SOME OF THE CRITICAL ENERGY

01:55:19.178 --> 01:55:20.747
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S ALREADY IN

01:55:20.813 --> 01:55:23.983
PLACE AND, YOU KNOW, WILLING TO

01:55:24.050 --> 01:55:25.652
CONTINUE DISCUSSING WITH YOU ALL

01:55:25.718 --> 01:55:28.521
WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE. YOU

01:55:28.588 --> 01:55:30.990
KNOW, I THINK THE GOAL FOR, FOR

01:55:31.057 --> 01:55:33.326
US IS AT LEAST, IS MAKING SURE

01:55:33.393 --> 01:55:34.727
THAT THESE DECOMMISSIONED LINES

01:55:34.794 --> 01:55:37.363
ARE COMING DOWN TO KNOW THAT THE

01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:39.699
MAIN FOCUS NOW OF THE

01:55:39.766 --> 01:55:41.234
INVESTIGATION INTO THE EATON

01:55:41.301 --> 01:55:42.969
FIRES ARE LINES THAT ARE OLDER

01:55:43.036 --> 01:55:44.470
THAN I AM, THAT HAVE BEEN

01:55:44.537 --> 01:55:46.606
SITTING NORTH IN ALTADENA AND

01:55:46.673 --> 01:55:48.474
THAT HAVE BEEN DE-ENERGIZED FOR

01:55:48.541 --> 01:55:51.177
OVER 50 YEARS, IS REALLY

01:55:51.244 --> 01:55:53.413
CONCERNING. YOU KNOW, WE DON'T

01:55:53.479 --> 01:55:54.480
MAKING THE PUBLIC AWARE OF WHERE

01:55:54.547 --> 01:55:56.316
THOSE LOCATIONS ARE ISN'T AS BIG

01:55:56.382 --> 01:55:58.284
OF A CONCERN. IT'S ABOUT THEM

01:55:58.351 --> 01:55:59.619
BEING TAKEN DOWN. THAT'S THAT'S

01:55:59.686 --> 01:56:01.254
MY GOAL AND THAT'S THE PURPOSE

01:56:01.321 --> 01:56:03.289
OF THIS. SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE

01:56:03.356 --> 01:56:04.991
MORE FIRES LIKE THIS. YEAH. AND

01:56:05.058 --> 01:56:07.193

01:56:07.260 --> 01:56:08.728
POINT. AND THANK YOU FOR, FOR

01:56:08.795 --> 01:56:10.129
SAYING THAT, THAT IF THESE ARE

01:56:10.196 --> 01:56:11.497
SUCH A SECURITY CONCERN, THEN

01:56:11.564 --> 01:56:13.566
THEY SHOULDN'T BE SITTING THERE

01:56:13.633 --> 01:56:14.100
IDLE, THAT THEY SHOULD BE

01:56:14.167 --> 01:56:15.068
REMOVED. SO BEFORE I TURN IT

01:56:15.134 --> 01:56:17.103
BACK OVER, I JUST WANT TO SAY

01:56:17.170 --> 01:56:18.538
THANK YOU AGAIN TO THE COUNCIL

01:56:18.604 --> 01:56:19.906

01:56:19.972 --> 01:56:21.407
BEEN IN YOUR SHOES. I APPRECIATE

01:56:21.474 --> 01:56:22.275
EVERYTHING THAT'S IN THIS BILL

01:56:22.342 --> 01:56:24.077
IN TERMS OF COORDINATION WITH

01:56:24.143 --> 01:56:26.245
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS WELL.

01:56:26.312 --> 01:56:28.781
DURING AN EMERGENCY, YOU ARE THE

01:56:28.848 --> 01:56:29.982
FRONTLINE. YOU'RE THE TRUSTED

01:56:30.049 --> 01:56:31.284
FACE, THE TRUSTED VOICE FOR YOUR

01:56:31.351 --> 01:56:32.218
COMMUNITY THAT OFTENTIMES

01:56:32.285 --> 01:56:33.986
DOESN'T KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING.

01:56:34.053 --> 01:56:35.788
AND SO EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE

01:56:35.855 --> 01:56:37.023
POLICIES THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN

01:56:37.090 --> 01:56:39.058
PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE IOUS

01:56:39.125 --> 01:56:40.259
ARE PROVIDING MORE INFORMATION

01:56:40.326 --> 01:56:42.328
TO THE PUBLIC, IT REALLY IS MORE

01:56:42.395 --> 01:56:43.863
MEANINGFUL WHEN IT COMES FROM

01:56:43.930 --> 01:56:44.530
THEIR LOCAL REPRESENTATIVES THAT

01:56:44.597 --> 01:56:46.532
THEY SEE DAY IN AND DAY OUT AT,

01:56:46.599 --> 01:56:48.067
AT THEATER, HELPING TO REBUILD

01:56:48.134 --> 01:56:49.569
THE COMMUNITY TO KNOW WHAT'S

01:56:49.635 --> 01:56:50.970
GOING ON. SO I REALLY APPRECIATE

01:56:51.037 --> 01:56:52.939
THAT BEING IN THE BILL AND I'LL

01:56:53.005 --> 01:56:55.308
I'LL MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU.

01:56:55.375 --> 01:56:57.810
ASSEMBLY MEMBER SCHULTZ. THANK

01:56:57.877 --> 01:56:59.178

01:56:59.245 --> 01:57:01.748
THERE'S A NEED FOR A SECOND, I'D

01:57:01.814 --> 01:57:02.515
GLADLY SECOND. SENATOR, I WANTED

01:57:02.582 --> 01:57:04.150

01:57:04.217 --> 01:57:06.119
BILL. AND, SIR, I WANTED TO

01:57:06.185 --> 01:57:07.220
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY

01:57:07.286 --> 01:57:08.054
TODAY. YOU'RE RIGHT. THERE ARE

01:57:08.121 --> 01:57:09.288
6000 PLUS STORIES JUST LIKE

01:57:09.355 --> 01:57:11.257
YOURS. AND I CAN IMAGINE IT DOES

01:57:11.324 --> 01:57:13.292
NOT GET ANY EASIER TO TELL THAT

01:57:13.359 --> 01:57:15.094
STORY. BUT FOR YOU TO BE HERE IN

01:57:15.161 --> 01:57:16.362
OUR STATE CAPITOL TODAY, I JUST

01:57:16.429 --> 01:57:18.297
WANT TO THANK YOU FOR SHARING

01:57:18.364 --> 01:57:19.932
THAT PERSPECTIVE. I THINK THIS

01:57:19.999 --> 01:57:21.467
IS A GOOD BILL. I THINK IT'S A

01:57:21.534 --> 01:57:22.735
COMMON SENSE STRATEGY. I WILL

01:57:22.802 --> 01:57:24.137
SUPPORT IT. AND, SENATOR, SHOULD

01:57:24.203 --> 01:57:25.204
YOU NEED A COAUTHOR ON THE

01:57:25.271 --> 01:57:26.506
ASSEMBLY SIDE, I'D BE HONORED TO

01:57:26.572 --> 01:57:28.307
HELP IN THAT CAPACITY. THANK

01:57:28.374 --> 01:57:29.575
YOU, MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU.

01:57:29.642 --> 01:57:30.877
ASSEMBLY MEMBER ZIPPER. SO FIRST

OF ALL, I WANT TO THANK THE

01:57:33.446 --> 01:57:36.983
SENATOR. I MEAN, IT'S. SO

01:57:37.049 --> 01:57:40.019
IMPRESSIVE THE YOUR LEADERSHIP

01:57:40.086 --> 01:57:42.088
REALLY PROTECTING YOUR COMMUNITY

01:57:42.155 --> 01:57:44.290
AROUND THE WILDFIRE. YOU KNOW,

01:57:44.357 --> 01:57:45.792
YOU CAME INTO OFFICE AND WITHIN

01:57:45.858 --> 01:57:48.327
DAYS, YOU HAD TO DEAL WITH A

01:57:48.394 --> 01:57:49.695
REAL CRISIS IN THE COMMUNITY.

01:57:49.762 --> 01:57:52.131
AND I KNOW THIS IS PART OF THE,

01:57:52.198 --> 01:57:54.400
YOU KNOW, INSPIRING LEADERSHIP

01:57:54.467 --> 01:57:55.301
TO PROTECT YOUR COMMUNITY AND

01:57:55.368 --> 01:57:57.036
JUST SORT OF WANT TO RECOGNIZE

01:57:57.103 --> 01:57:59.405
THAT. AND ALSO, I'VE MET YOUR

01:57:59.472 --> 01:58:01.574
YOUR WITNESS BEFORE AND JUST

01:58:01.641 --> 01:58:03.709
WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE

01:58:03.776 --> 01:58:05.278
IN THE CAPITOL AS WELL. WHEN I

01:58:05.344 --> 01:58:07.246
LOOK AT THE COMMENTS ON THE

01:58:07.313 --> 01:58:09.081
BILL, A LOT OF THE COMMENTS

01:58:09.148 --> 01:58:12.051
REALLY LOOK TO ARE REALLY AROUND

01:58:12.118 --> 01:58:14.120
THE WHOLE ISSUE OF THE FACT THAT

01:58:14.187 --> 01:58:17.056
THE PUC HAS ALREADY ESTABLISHED

01:58:17.123 --> 01:58:18.825
SOME, YOU KNOW, FAIRLY

01:58:18.891 --> 01:58:19.892
COMPREHENSIVE REQUIREMENTS

01:58:19.959 --> 01:58:22.094
AROUND PSPS PROGRAMS. AND I

01:58:22.161 --> 01:58:24.764
THINK A LOT OF THE CONCERN IS

01:58:24.831 --> 01:58:27.266
ABOUT HOW THE CURRENT PROGRAMS

01:58:27.333 --> 01:58:28.935
MIGHT OVERLAP WITH THINGS IN THE

01:58:29.001 --> 01:58:31.337
BILL. AND SO JUST WANTED TO IT

01:58:31.404 --> 01:58:32.672
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE ALREADY

01:58:32.738 --> 01:58:33.272
WORKING PRETTY CLOSELY WITH

01:58:33.339 --> 01:58:35.741
THAT, BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE

01:58:35.808 --> 01:58:37.944
GOOD TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE SORT OF

01:58:38.010 --> 01:58:38.878
ALIGNING WHAT'S ALREADY THERE

01:58:38.945 --> 01:58:40.780
WITH THE NEW STUFF. AND, YOU

01:58:40.847 --> 01:58:44.016
KNOW, AND UNDERSTANDING WHERE

01:58:44.083 --> 01:58:45.585
WE'VE GOT CASES WHERE THE

01:58:45.651 --> 01:58:46.552
EXISTING REQUIREMENTS JUST

01:58:46.619 --> 01:58:47.753
WEREN'T BEING FOLLOWED VERSUS

01:58:47.820 --> 01:58:49.155
NOT HAVING REQUIREMENTS THERE.

01:58:49.222 --> 01:58:51.524
SO I JUST WANTED TO SORT OF ASK

01:58:51.591 --> 01:58:52.825
IF YOU'D CONTINUE WORKING WITH

01:58:52.892 --> 01:58:55.194
THE SPONSORS TO TRY TO SORT OF

01:58:55.261 --> 01:58:56.996
TIGHTEN THAT UP AND MAKE SURE WE

01:58:57.063 --> 01:58:58.865
DON'T END UP HAVING SORT OF

01:58:58.931 --> 01:58:59.499
DUPLICATIVE REQUIREMENTS WHERE

01:58:59.565 --> 01:59:02.134
WE'RE ACTUALLY PROVIDING LIKE

01:59:02.201 --> 01:59:04.604
DUPLICATIVE BURDENS ON THE ON

01:59:04.670 --> 01:59:06.839
THE ON FOLKS THAT RESULT IN, YOU

01:59:06.906 --> 01:59:08.241
KNOW, RATE INCREASES, FRANKLY.

01:59:08.307 --> 01:59:10.910
SO, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. AND, YES,

01:59:10.977 --> 01:59:12.278
I MEAN, YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT.

01:59:12.345 --> 01:59:14.747
I THINK OUR OFFICE HAS BEEN

01:59:14.814 --> 01:59:17.083
WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH, YOU

01:59:17.149 --> 01:59:19.085
KNOW, SEVERAL I THINK, OF THE

01:59:19.151 --> 01:59:20.920
IOUS YOU HEARD FROM HERE TODAY

01:59:20.987 --> 01:59:22.288
AND THOSE THAT ARE IN

01:59:22.355 --> 01:59:24.156
OPPOSITION. AND, YOU KNOW, WE'RE

01:59:24.223 --> 01:59:25.925
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE TO

01:59:25.992 --> 01:59:27.793
PLUG SOME OF THOSE GAPS. I THINK

01:59:27.860 --> 01:59:29.829
ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT CAME UP

01:59:29.896 --> 01:59:33.032
THAT WAS Dð FOR US AND THAT WE

01:59:33.099 --> 01:59:34.166
FELT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT, THAT

01:59:34.233 --> 01:59:35.902
I HIGHLIGHTED IN MY TALKING

01:59:35.968 --> 01:59:38.037
POINTS, WERE WHEN THE PASADENA

01:59:38.104 --> 01:59:40.439
FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD SHARED WITH

01:59:40.506 --> 01:59:41.974
US, AS WELL AS EXPRESSED IN

01:59:42.041 --> 01:59:45.011
REPORTS TO NPR THAT THERE WERE

01:59:45.077 --> 01:59:46.679
DELAYS IN POWER SHUTOFFS AS THEY

01:59:46.746 --> 01:59:48.247
WERE GOING AROUND TO HOMES TO

01:59:48.314 --> 01:59:49.715
TRY TO PUT OUT FIRES. OBVIOUSLY,

01:59:49.782 --> 01:59:51.083
THAT CREATES A FIRE RISK FOR

01:59:51.150 --> 01:59:53.252
THEM AS WELL. AND SO I THINK

01:59:53.319 --> 01:59:54.987
IT'S JUST ABOUT COORDINATION AND

01:59:55.054 --> 01:59:57.590
WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

01:59:57.657 --> 01:59:58.558
PREPARING FOR THESE EVENTS

01:59:58.624 --> 02:00:02.161
BEFORE THEY HAPPEN. IT IS IT IS

02:00:02.228 --> 02:00:04.163
SO SAD TO ME AND DEVASTATING

02:00:04.230 --> 02:00:05.665
THAT WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT

02:00:05.731 --> 02:00:07.166
THESE THINGS AS A PART OF NORMAL

02:00:07.233 --> 02:00:09.402
LIFE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I MEAN,

02:00:09.468 --> 02:00:11.470
JUST A FEW DAYS AGO, WE WERE

02:00:11.537 --> 02:00:13.039
DEALING WITH A MAJOR FIRE OUT IN

02:00:13.105 --> 02:00:15.675
SAN LUIS OBISPO. AND SO THIS IS

02:00:15.741 --> 02:00:17.009
VERY MUCH OUR OUR NEW REALITY.

02:00:17.076 --> 02:00:19.045
AND I THINK WE'RE CONTINUING TO

02:00:19.111 --> 02:00:21.514
LOOK FOR WAYS TO, TO BETTER

02:00:21.581 --> 02:00:22.748
PREPARE, TO BETTER STRATEGIZE

02:00:22.815 --> 02:00:24.884
AROUND POWER SHUTOFFS AND JUST

02:00:24.951 --> 02:00:25.685
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

02:00:25.751 --> 02:00:26.619
COORDINATING WITH DIFFERENT

02:00:26.686 --> 02:00:28.521
AGENCIES. RIGHT. AND ESPECIALLY

02:00:28.588 --> 02:00:31.290
FOR DISTRICTS LIKE MINE OF 19

02:00:31.357 --> 02:00:33.292
CITIES, THAT THAT BECOMES REALLY

02:00:33.359 --> 02:00:36.495
IMPORTANT. SO THANK YOU. THANK

02:00:36.562 --> 02:00:39.832
YOU, ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAPAN.

02:00:39.899 --> 02:00:41.767
WELL, THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE

02:00:41.834 --> 02:00:43.369
BILL. AND THANK YOU FOR BEING

02:00:43.436 --> 02:00:45.771
HERE TODAY. IT IS A CONSTANT

02:00:45.838 --> 02:00:47.206
REMINDER THAT WHILE WE MAY HAVE

02:00:47.273 --> 02:00:49.141
LOST STUFF, WE LOST A PART OF

02:00:49.208 --> 02:00:50.443
OURSELVES AS WELL. SO I

02:00:50.509 --> 02:00:51.177
APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND

02:00:51.243 --> 02:00:53.012
YOU'RE SPEAKING WITH SUCH AN

02:00:53.079 --> 02:00:54.246
OPEN HEART. MY QUESTION REALLY,

02:00:54.313 --> 02:00:56.949
BECAUSE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, I

02:00:57.016 --> 02:00:58.751
MEAN, SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC

02:00:58.818 --> 02:01:01.654
IS HERE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT, AS A

02:01:01.721 --> 02:01:02.788
SENATOR TESTIFIED TO A TOWER

02:01:02.855 --> 02:01:05.091
THAT MAY HAVE BEEN 50 YEARS OLD

02:01:05.157 --> 02:01:08.661
AND ABANDONED. DO YOU HAVE THIS

02:01:08.728 --> 02:01:11.197
MAY NOT BE A PART OF THE BILL,

02:01:11.263 --> 02:01:12.031
BUT DO YOU HAVE PROCESSES IN

02:01:12.098 --> 02:01:15.267
PLACE THAT PRIORITIZE NOT ONLY

02:01:15.334 --> 02:01:16.669
ABANDONED, BUT ABANDONED FOR,

02:01:16.736 --> 02:01:18.838
YOU KNOW, A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF

02:01:18.904 --> 02:01:22.541
TIME THAT REQUIRES SOME URGENCY

02:01:22.608 --> 02:01:24.410
TO ITS REMOVAL? AND WHERE ARE

02:01:24.477 --> 02:01:25.878
YOU? AND I RECOGNIZE YOU DON'T

02:01:25.945 --> 02:01:30.049
WANT TO REVEAL YOUR INVENTORY AS

02:01:30.116 --> 02:01:31.917
TO ABANDONED LINES, AND THAT'S

02:01:31.984 --> 02:01:33.953
OKAY. BUT ARE YOU YOURSELVES

02:01:34.020 --> 02:01:35.321
KEEPING THOSE AND GETTING

02:01:35.388 --> 02:01:36.555
GETTING THE WORK DONE AS IT

02:01:36.622 --> 02:01:39.458
NEEDS TO BE DONE? YOU KNOW, IT

02:01:39.525 --> 02:01:40.326
REALLY DOES BEG THE QUESTION. WE

02:01:40.393 --> 02:01:41.627
CAN LEGISLATE ALL DAY LONG

02:01:41.694 --> 02:01:42.395
WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING IN THE

02:01:42.461 --> 02:01:44.030
FIELD. YEAH. SO WE'RE REQUIRED

02:01:44.096 --> 02:01:46.365
UNDER GEO 95. I BELIEVE IT IS TO

02:01:46.432 --> 02:01:49.468
HAVE A PLAN FOR WHAT WE'RE GOING

02:01:49.535 --> 02:01:50.569
TO DO WITH OUR ABANDONED LINES.

02:01:50.636 --> 02:01:53.439
I SPEAKING FOR SDG, I KNOW IF WE

02:01:53.506 --> 02:01:54.640
HAVE LINES THAT WE AREN'T

02:01:54.707 --> 02:01:56.342
PLANNING TO USE, WE IT'S OUR

02:01:56.409 --> 02:01:58.377
BEST INTEREST TO GET RID OF THEM

02:01:58.444 --> 02:01:59.845
AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. WE HAVE A

02:01:59.912 --> 02:02:01.714
PROCESS THAT WE SEND OUT LETTERS

02:02:01.781 --> 02:02:02.915
TO LAND OWNERS AND TYPICALLY

02:02:02.982 --> 02:02:06.052
HAPPENS VERY QUICKLY. ALSO,

02:02:06.118 --> 02:02:07.653
WE'RE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN THOSE

02:02:07.720 --> 02:02:09.221
LINES AS THEY ARE ACTIVE LINES.

02:02:09.288 --> 02:02:11.457
SO, YOU KNOW, IF WE HAVE AN

02:02:11.524 --> 02:02:12.858
ABANDONED LINE OUT THERE THAT'S

02:02:12.925 --> 02:02:14.794
NOT BEING USED, WE HAVE TO JUST

02:02:14.860 --> 02:02:17.396
LIKE IT WAS A REGULAR LINE. SOME

02:02:17.463 --> 02:02:18.931
OF THE REASONS FOR LIKE

02:02:18.998 --> 02:02:20.366
PROLONGING IT A LITTLE BIT WOULD

02:02:20.433 --> 02:02:22.234
BE JUST, YOU KNOW, FOR THE

02:02:22.301 --> 02:02:23.703
FUTURE LOAD GROWTH THAT WE COULD

02:02:23.769 --> 02:02:25.438
HAVE IN THOSE LINES COULD BE

02:02:25.504 --> 02:02:27.106
USED TO, YOU KNOW, CONNECT

02:02:27.173 --> 02:02:29.642
DIFFERENT GENERATION FACILITIES.

02:02:29.709 --> 02:02:31.777
AND IF WE TAKE THEM DOWN AND

02:02:31.844 --> 02:02:33.412
THEN THERE'S SOMETHING THAT THAT

02:02:33.479 --> 02:02:35.314
HAPPENS LATER ON THAT WE NEED

02:02:35.381 --> 02:02:36.248
THEM FOR, THEN WE'D HAVE TO

02:02:36.315 --> 02:02:37.850
REBUILD THEM AGAIN. WE DON'T

02:02:37.917 --> 02:02:39.251
WANT TO DO THAT WITH THE COST.

02:02:39.318 --> 02:02:41.087
AND, YOU KNOW, AFFORDABILITY

02:02:41.153 --> 02:02:42.054
CRISIS AND TRANSMISSION COSTS

02:02:42.121 --> 02:02:43.956
THAT WE ALL KNOW ABOUT VERY

02:02:44.023 --> 02:02:46.025
WELL. SO WE DO HAVE A PROCESS TO

02:02:46.092 --> 02:02:48.494
GO ABOUT THAT. BUT I THINK I

02:02:48.561 --> 02:02:50.696
KIND OF SEE THAT DIFFERENTLY IN,

02:02:50.763 --> 02:02:51.897
IN WHAT THEY CONSIDER AN

02:02:51.964 --> 02:02:52.598
ABANDONED LINE WHEN THEY'RE

02:02:52.665 --> 02:02:54.467
GOING TO TAKE IT DOWN RIGHT

02:02:54.533 --> 02:02:56.736
AWAY, OR IF IT'S SEEN AS

02:02:56.802 --> 02:02:58.604
SOMETHING THAT COULD BE USED IN

02:02:58.671 --> 02:03:00.439
THE FUTURE FOR AN ADDITIONAL

02:03:00.506 --> 02:03:02.675
PROJECT OR A CONNECTION TO

02:03:02.742 --> 02:03:03.442
SOMETHING ELSE. SO HOPE THAT

02:03:03.509 --> 02:03:04.410
ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION, MADAM

02:03:04.477 --> 02:03:06.412

INCORPORATED INTO STATUTE

THROUGH AB 825, SB 647 IS ABOUT

02:07:39.985 --> 02:07:41.520
MORE THAN ENERGY. IT'S ABOUT

02:07:41.587 --> 02:07:43.322

PEOPLE IN ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS

02:07:47.526 --> 02:07:48.827
WORK LONG HOURS JUST TO MAKE

02:07:48.894 --> 02:07:50.896
ENOUGH TO PAY THEIR BILLS, AND

02:07:50.963 --> 02:07:52.264
MANY HAVE TO MAKE GUT WRENCHING

02:07:52.331 --> 02:07:54.166
CHOICES EVERY MONTH, WHETHER

TODAY'S REALITY. CALIFORNIA'S

02:08:02.007 --> 02:08:03.575
LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ARE

02:08:03.642 --> 02:08:04.910
GETTING SQUEEZED WITH HIGH COST

02:08:04.977 --> 02:08:07.679

PEOPLE WHO ARE FALLING THROUGH

02:08:12.184 --> 02:08:13.819
THE CRACKS OF A SYSTEM THAT

HASN'T KEPT UP WITH TODAY'S

02:08:15.254 --> 02:08:18.357
ECONOMIC REALITY. SO SB 647

02:08:18.424 --> 02:08:21.160
LOOKS TO CLOSE THOSE CRACKS AND

02:08:21.226 --> 02:08:22.828
TO BRING FAIRNESS, ACCESS AND

EXIST AND CAN UTILIZE THEM FOR

02:08:30.135 --> 02:08:32.171
REAL SAVINGS. IT DOES THIS BY

02:08:32.237 --> 02:08:33.505
STRENGTHENING THE COORDINATION

02:08:33.572 --> 02:08:34.640

SURE CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY

02:08:53.959 --> 02:08:55.360

02:10:17.376 --> 02:10:18.010
MEMBERS, INCLUDING COMMUNITY

02:10:18.076 --> 02:10:20.479
BASED ORGANIZATIONS OF SOCIAL,

02:10:20.546 --> 02:10:21.547
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL JUSTICE

02:10:21.613 --> 02:10:23.549
GROUPS, SMALL BUSINESSES, FAITH

02:10:23.615 --> 02:10:25.417
BASED GROUPS, AND INDIVIDUALS

02:10:25.484 --> 02:10:27.152
THAT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT LOW

02:10:27.219 --> 02:10:27.753
INCOME GETTING THE BENEFIT OF

02:10:27.819 --> 02:10:29.655
ALL THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE OUT

02:10:29.721 --> 02:10:30.656
THERE FOR THEIR WELL-BEING AND

02:10:30.722 --> 02:10:32.324
FOR ALSO, THEY WANT TO ALSO STAY

02:10:32.391 --> 02:10:35.527
WITH THE 2045 MANDATE OF ZERO

02:10:35.594 --> 02:10:37.196
EMISSIONS. AS I SAID HERE TODAY,

02:10:37.262 --> 02:10:38.630
HEARING ALL THESE DISCUSSIONS,

02:10:38.697 --> 02:10:39.965
SOME OF THESE LOW INCOME PEOPLE

02:10:40.032 --> 02:10:41.466
DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND ALL THAT.

02:10:41.533 --> 02:10:43.135
AND THAT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY

02:10:43.202 --> 02:10:44.469
TO GET THAT INFORMATION TO THEM,

02:10:44.536 --> 02:10:46.805
BUT ALSO TO INCLUDE THEM IN THIS

02:10:46.872 --> 02:10:47.606
CLEAN AND TRANSITION THAT HAS TO

02:10:47.673 --> 02:10:51.176
GO THROUGH. SO WE THINK THAT OUR

02:10:51.243 --> 02:10:52.711
GOAL IS TO CHAMPION THE NEEDS OF

02:10:52.778 --> 02:10:54.813
LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. AND WE

02:10:54.880 --> 02:10:56.848
DO THAT BY PROMOTING GOOD ENERGY

02:10:56.915 --> 02:10:58.283
POLICIES AND ADVOCATING FOR GOOD

02:10:58.350 --> 02:11:00.118
ENERGY PROGRAMS SO THAT

02:11:00.185 --> 02:11:01.220
PRIORITIZE LOW INCOME

02:11:01.286 --> 02:11:03.055
COMMUNITIES SO THEY CAN THRIVE

02:11:03.121 --> 02:11:04.456
ECONOMICALLY AND BE PART OF THE

02:11:04.523 --> 02:11:07.292
PART OF SELF-SUFFICIENT. WE

02:11:07.359 --> 02:11:09.928
THINK THAT SB 647 IS OUR

02:11:09.995 --> 02:11:11.263
INCREDIBLE AUTHOR HERE, HAS

02:11:11.330 --> 02:11:13.198
SAID, ADDRESSES A LOT OF THESE

02:11:13.265 --> 02:11:14.299
ISSUES THAT LOW INCOME PEOPLE

02:11:14.366 --> 02:11:20.606
FACE EVERY DAY, THAT I'M

02:11:20.672 --> 02:11:21.206
BLESSED. AND I THINK EVERYBODY

02:11:21.273 --> 02:11:23.141
IN THIS ROOM IS BLESSED NOT TO

02:11:23.208 --> 02:11:24.376
HAVE TO DEAL WITH. AND THEY HAVE

02:11:24.443 --> 02:11:26.545
THE BENEFIT OF ALL THE PROGRAMS.

02:11:26.612 --> 02:11:30.082
ALSO, PUC 2790 WHEN THESE LOW

02:11:30.148 --> 02:11:31.783
INCOME PROGRAMS BECAME

02:11:31.850 --> 02:11:33.318
LEGISLATED, THE INTENT WAS TO

02:11:33.385 --> 02:11:35.821
ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE MEASURES

02:11:35.887 --> 02:11:39.191
HOLD THAT REDUCE ENERGY USE, BUT

02:11:39.258 --> 02:11:40.592
ALSO TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

02:11:40.659 --> 02:11:42.694
LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND THE

02:11:42.761 --> 02:11:43.629
HARDSHIPS THEY GO THROUGH IN

02:11:43.695 --> 02:11:45.430
ENERGY. AND I THANK YOU AND I

02:11:45.497 --> 02:11:47.532
ASK YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL.

02:11:47.599 --> 02:11:48.367

HERE. THE AREA THAT THAT WE

02:11:54.873 --> 02:11:55.907
REPRESENT, OF COURSE, IS THE

02:11:55.974 --> 02:11:57.242
ENTIRE STATE, BUT A LITTLE BIT

02:11:57.309 --> 02:11:59.878
OF FOCUS ON THE CENTRAL VALLEY,

02:11:59.945 --> 02:12:00.912
GIVEN THAT, YOU KNOW, THE

02:12:00.979 --> 02:12:02.481
CENTRAL VALLEY IS ONE OF THOSE

02:12:02.547 --> 02:12:05.651
HARDEST HIT AREAS WHERE WE HAVE

02:12:05.717 --> 02:12:06.952
A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ISSUES

02:12:07.019 --> 02:12:09.454
THAT ARE CHALLENGES. THAT IS

02:12:09.521 --> 02:12:11.156
AND, YOU KNOW, AND SO WE WANT TO

02:12:11.223 --> 02:12:12.524
MAKE SURE THAT NOW THAT WITH

02:12:12.591 --> 02:12:14.526
CLIMATE CHANGE THAT'S HAPPENING

02:12:14.593 --> 02:12:17.062
BEFORE OUR EYES AND THE GREATER

02:12:17.129 --> 02:12:20.499
USE OF ENERGY AND A LOT OF THESE

02:12:20.565 --> 02:12:22.167
FAMILIES THAT THAT LIVE IN THESE

02:12:22.234 --> 02:12:23.502
DIFFERENT RURAL COMMUNITIES,

02:12:23.568 --> 02:12:24.603
THAT THEY'RE NOT FORGOTTEN

02:12:24.670 --> 02:12:26.271
BECAUSE THESE ARE LIFELINES FOR

02:12:26.338 --> 02:12:29.608
THEM. AND AS MUCH AS THEY DON'T,

02:12:29.675 --> 02:12:30.509
THEY'RE NOT LOOKING FOR

02:12:30.575 --> 02:12:31.810
HANDOUTS. WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING

02:12:31.877 --> 02:12:33.111
FOR IS ASSISTANCE. AND SO WE

02:12:33.178 --> 02:12:34.713
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE

02:12:34.780 --> 02:12:36.481
A VOICE AND A VOTE. AND THAT'S

02:12:36.548 --> 02:12:38.350
WHY WE'RE HERE THIS TODAY. AND

02:12:38.417 --> 02:12:39.551
WE'VE BEEN HERE ALL THE WAY

02:12:39.618 --> 02:12:41.853

COUNTY RESIDENT. ALL RIGHT,

02:13:33.472 --> 02:13:36.641
TURNING TO OPPOSITION TESTIMONY,

02:13:36.708 --> 02:13:39.211
GO AHEAD. AND IF WE HAVE A

02:13:39.277 --> 02:13:40.245
PRIMARY OPPOSITION WITNESS, YOU

02:13:40.312 --> 02:13:43.715
MAY COME ON UP. WE'RE KIND OF

02:13:43.782 --> 02:13:46.818
TWEENERS. ALL RIGHT. SORRY. HI.

02:13:46.885 --> 02:13:48.153
WITH SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC

02:13:48.220 --> 02:13:49.788
AND SOCAL GAS, WE'RE TWEENERS IN

02:13:49.855 --> 02:13:51.123
THE SENSE THAT WE DIDN'T SUBMIT

02:13:51.189 --> 02:13:52.858
A LETTER, LETTER OF OPPOSITION,

02:13:52.924 --> 02:13:54.292
BUT HAVE BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY

02:13:54.359 --> 02:13:56.128
WITH THE AUTHOR AND THEIR

02:13:56.194 --> 02:13:57.262
SPONSORS TO TRY AND MEET A

02:13:57.329 --> 02:13:58.897
MIDDLE GROUND, BECAUSE WE FEEL

02:13:58.964 --> 02:14:00.699
THAT THIS BILL AND THE INTENTION

02:14:00.766 --> 02:14:02.334
OF THE BILL IS GREAT. IT'S GOOD,

02:14:02.401 --> 02:14:03.969
I THINK HELPING LOW INCOME

02:14:04.035 --> 02:14:06.972
HOUSEHOLDS IS IMPORTANT AND I

02:14:07.038 --> 02:14:08.273
ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND IT.

02:14:08.340 --> 02:14:10.142
HOWEVER, THE WAY IN WHICH WE GO

02:14:10.208 --> 02:14:11.843
ABOUT THAT, I THINK WE HAVE

02:14:11.910 --> 02:14:13.378
DIFFERENCES IN WHICH WE WANT TO

02:14:13.445 --> 02:14:16.181
APPROACH THAT, IN PARTICULAR THE

02:14:16.248 --> 02:14:18.150
METRICS. I THINK THAT WE WANT TO

02:14:18.216 --> 02:14:19.384
TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT

02:14:19.451 --> 02:14:22.053
MORE THE WAY THAT WE'RE LOOKING

02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:24.022
AT, BECAUSE THE BILL RIGHT NOW

02:14:24.089 --> 02:14:26.024
CALLS FOR PERFORMANCE METRICS.

02:14:26.091 --> 02:14:29.528
THAT INCLUDES LOOKING AT

02:14:29.594 --> 02:14:31.396
HOUSEHOLD INCOME AS WELL. AND I

02:14:31.463 --> 02:14:33.098
THINK THAT'S REALLY HARD FOR US

02:14:33.165 --> 02:14:35.066
TO COLLECT THAT KIND OF DATA. SO

02:14:35.133 --> 02:14:37.235
I THINK WE NEED TO TALK A LITTLE

02:14:37.302 --> 02:14:39.237
BIT MORE TO SEE HOW WE CAN GO

02:14:39.304 --> 02:14:41.306
ABOUT DOING THAT. BUT WE WANT TO

02:14:41.373 --> 02:14:42.507
CONTINUE TALKING TO THEM AND

02:14:42.574 --> 02:14:44.009
FIGURING OUT WHERE OUR BEAUTIFUL

02:14:44.075 --> 02:14:44.609
MIDDLE GROUND WILL BE. THANK

02:14:55.821 --> 02:14:57.022

SOMETIMES THEY HAVEN'T ALWAYS

02:16:11.229 --> 02:16:12.497
BEEN AS EFFECTIVE AS THEY SHOULD

02:16:12.564 --> 02:16:14.366
BE, BUT I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT I

02:16:14.432 --> 02:16:17.235
GOT ONE PERSON IN MY DISTRICT

02:16:17.302 --> 02:16:18.069

ABOUT THE FISCAL ASPECT OF THE

02:16:28.547 --> 02:16:30.181
BILL, UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS

02:16:30.248 --> 02:16:31.383
WILL GO TO APPROPRIATIONS. BUT

02:16:31.449 --> 02:16:32.884
IF YOU'RE EXPLAINING TO

02:16:32.951 --> 02:16:35.153
CONSTITUENTS, IT'S NOTED

02:16:35.220 --> 02:16:36.588

FORWARD. WHAT ARE THEY GETTING

02:16:39.157 --> 02:16:40.692
FOR THAT? BECAUSE IT SAYS IT IS

02:16:40.759 --> 02:16:42.060
BEING PAID FOR BY RATEPAYERS.

02:16:42.127 --> 02:16:43.528

RATEPAYER DOLLARS, AND YOU'LL

02:16:55.073 --> 02:16:57.609
GET THIS FOR IT THAT YOU DON'T

02:16:57.676 --> 02:17:00.178
CURRENTLY HAVE. WELL, I'LL START

02:17:00.245 --> 02:17:02.247
OFF BY SAYING THAT WE'RE TRYING

02:17:02.314 --> 02:17:04.015
TO WORK ON THAT PIECE TO ENSURE

02:17:04.082 --> 02:17:06.885
THAT IT'S AS LOW AS POSSIBLE,

02:17:06.952 --> 02:17:09.321
BUT I'LL ALSO SAY THAT WE'RE

02:17:09.387 --> 02:17:12.557
TRYING TO MAKE THE PROGRAM MORE

02:17:12.624 --> 02:17:14.826
IT MAKE IT WORK FOR PEOPLE,

02:17:14.893 --> 02:17:16.227
RIGHT? AND THAT MEANS WE GOT TO

02:17:16.294 --> 02:17:18.797
CHECK IT, ENSURE THAT IT'S

02:17:18.863 --> 02:17:20.265
EFFICIENT, THAT IT'S WORKING.

02:17:20.332 --> 02:17:22.334
AND I THINK THAT A LOT OF THE

02:17:22.400 --> 02:17:23.468
INDIVIDUALS THAT KNOW ABOUT THIS

02:17:23.535 --> 02:17:26.338
PROGRAM KNOW HOW WONDERFUL IT IS

02:17:26.404 --> 02:17:28.840
AND HOW HELPFUL IT IS. AND SO I

02:17:28.907 --> 02:17:31.343
THINK THAT THAT THAT WOULD BE MY

02:17:31.409 --> 02:17:32.544
ANSWER TO THEM. IT'S SOMETHING

02:17:32.611 --> 02:17:33.678
THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK

02:17:33.745 --> 02:17:36.715
ON. I DON'T KNOW IF OUR SPONSORS

02:17:36.781 --> 02:17:38.917
WANT TO ADD TO THAT. NOT SURE.

02:17:38.984 --> 02:17:42.921

DEVELOPMENT OF IN-STATE SUPPLY

02:19:37.936 --> 02:19:41.005
CHAINS FOR THREE KEY CLEAN

02:19:41.072 --> 02:19:42.741
ENERGY INDUSTRIES. THOSE

02:19:42.807 --> 02:19:46.444
INDUSTRIES ARE ELECTRIC VEHICLES

BUILDING DECARBONIZATION

02:19:48.613 --> 02:19:49.981
TECHNOLOGIES. AND LASTLY,

02:19:50.048 --> 02:19:52.550
OFFSHORE WIND. CALIFORNIA IS A

02:19:52.617 --> 02:19:54.686
HUB FOR GREEN TECH INNOVATION

02:19:54.753 --> 02:19:56.521
AND RESEARCH, AND WE HAVE

02:19:56.588 --> 02:19:59.224
AMBITIOUS GOALS OF REACHING 100%

02:19:59.290 --> 02:20:03.461
CLEAN ENERGY BY 2045. HOWEVER,

02:20:03.528 --> 02:20:04.996
THERE'S A GAP IN OUR GREEN

02:20:05.063 --> 02:20:06.998
ECONOMY, AND THAT'S A LACK OF

02:20:07.065 --> 02:20:09.167
IN-STATE MANUFACTURING FOR CLEAN

02:20:09.234 --> 02:20:10.902
ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND

02:20:10.969 --> 02:20:14.472
EQUIPMENT. SB 787 FORMALIZES

02:20:14.539 --> 02:20:16.207
PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN THE STATE

02:20:16.274 --> 02:20:19.477
AGENCIES, LABOR, ENVIRONMENTAL

02:20:19.544 --> 02:20:21.412
ORGANIZATIONS AND CLEAN ENERGY

02:20:21.479 --> 02:20:24.149
INDUSTRIES TO CREATE A UNIFIED

02:20:24.215 --> 02:20:25.583
APPROACH TO BUILDING OUT

02:20:25.650 --> 02:20:27.552
CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY SUPPLY

02:20:27.619 --> 02:20:30.221
CHAINS AND WORKFORCE. THIS BILL

02:20:30.288 --> 02:20:31.790
WILL HELP CALIFORNIA MEET OUR

02:20:31.856 --> 02:20:33.191
CLEAN ENERGY GOALS WHILE

02:20:33.258 --> 02:20:36.394
CREATING FAMILY SUPPORTING JOBS,

02:20:36.461 --> 02:20:37.896
BOOSTING, BOOSTING

02:20:37.962 --> 02:20:39.697
AFFORDABILITY, AND ADVANCING

02:20:39.764 --> 02:20:41.900
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. WITH US

02:20:41.966 --> 02:20:44.435
TODAY TO TESTIFY, I HAVE TWO

02:20:44.502 --> 02:20:46.171
WITNESSES. SAMUEL APPEL OF THE

02:20:46.237 --> 02:20:50.141
UNITED AUTO WORKERS AND EGAN

02:20:50.208 --> 02:20:51.142
TERPLAN OF THE CALIFORNIA

02:20:51.209 --> 02:20:53.678
FORWARD. SO WITH THAT, I'LL TURN

02:20:53.745 --> 02:20:56.047
IT OVER TO SAMUEL. CHAIR AND

02:20:56.114 --> 02:20:57.182
MEMBERS, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

02:20:57.248 --> 02:20:59.117
HAVING ME. SAM APPEL, POLICY

02:20:59.184 --> 02:21:00.385
DIRECTOR WITH THE UNITED AUTO

02:21:00.451 --> 02:21:02.320
WORKERS, REGION SIX THAT

02:21:02.387 --> 02:21:03.555
ENCOMPASSES THE WESTERN STATES

02:21:03.621 --> 02:21:05.557
AND 100,000 MEMBERS IN

02:21:05.623 --> 02:21:07.425
CALIFORNIA. OUR MEMBERSHIP HAS

02:21:07.492 --> 02:21:10.662
THREE LARGE BASES IN CALIFORNIA

02:21:10.728 --> 02:21:11.229
MANUFACTURING WORKERS ACROSS

02:21:11.296 --> 02:21:13.498
DIFFERENT ENERGY SUPPLY CHAINS.

02:21:13.565 --> 02:21:16.401
HIGHER EDUCATION AND RESEARCH,

02:21:16.467 --> 02:21:18.136
AND STATE SERVICE EMPLOYEES

02:21:18.203 --> 02:21:20.371
WORKING AT STATE AGENCIES. THE

02:21:20.438 --> 02:21:21.906
GOAL OF OUR MEMBERSHIP IS FAIRLY

02:21:21.973 --> 02:21:23.641
SIMPLE WHEN IT COMES TO THE

02:21:23.708 --> 02:21:25.143
CLEAN ECONOMY. WE WANT TO GROW

02:21:25.210 --> 02:21:26.477
THE BASE OF MANUFACTURING JOBS

02:21:26.544 --> 02:21:28.680
IN CALIFORNIA. WE WANT TO

02:21:28.746 --> 02:21:30.215
ACCELERATE CLIMATE SOLUTIONS,

02:21:30.281 --> 02:21:33.618
AND WE WANT AFFORDABLE ENERGY.

02:21:33.685 --> 02:21:37.288
WE THINK THAT RIGHT NOW IS NOT

02:21:37.355 --> 02:21:39.757
THE TIME TO TAKE OUR FOOT OFF OF

02:21:39.824 --> 02:21:41.526
THE PEDAL, AND WE NEED TO MAKE

02:21:41.593 --> 02:21:43.795
SURE THAT WE'RE ACCELERATING

02:21:43.862 --> 02:21:45.230
DELIVERY ON OUR CLIMATE GOALS

02:21:45.296 --> 02:21:46.331
AFFORDABLY AND CREATING HIGH

02:21:46.397 --> 02:21:48.733
QUALITY JOBS AT THE SAME TIME.

02:21:48.800 --> 02:21:51.302
SB 787 TAKES A VERY DELIBERATE

02:21:51.369 --> 02:21:52.804
AND STRATEGIC APPROACH TO

02:21:52.871 --> 02:21:54.072
ACCELERATING GROWTH IN THESE

02:21:54.138 --> 02:21:55.707
THREE INDUSTRIES, WHICH

02:21:55.773 --> 02:21:57.442
CALIFORNIA HAS UNIQUE STRATEGIC

02:21:57.509 --> 02:21:58.843
ADVANTAGES IN, BUT WHICH AT THIS

02:21:58.910 --> 02:22:01.646
POINT WE ARE NOT DELIVERING ON.

02:22:01.713 --> 02:22:03.548
TO CREATE HIGH QUALITY IN-STATE

02:22:03.615 --> 02:22:05.250
JOBS, FOR ONE, WE KNOW THAT

02:22:05.316 --> 02:22:07.118
PUBLIC MONEY GOING TO THESE

02:22:07.185 --> 02:22:08.519
INDUSTRIES IS NOT WELL

02:22:08.586 --> 02:22:10.088
COORDINATED AROUND A LONG TERM

02:22:10.154 --> 02:22:11.856
VISION. THE COMPANIES AND

02:22:11.923 --> 02:22:13.358
INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS WE WORK

02:22:13.424 --> 02:22:15.126
WITH TELL US THIS AND THAT IT'S

02:22:15.193 --> 02:22:16.494
PREVENTING LONG TERM INDUSTRY

02:22:16.561 --> 02:22:19.030
GROWTH AND COMPETITIVENESS.

02:22:19.097 --> 02:22:21.532
SECONDLY, SB 787 CREATES A FORUM

02:22:21.599 --> 02:22:24.202
FOR THE CEC AGENCIES AND

02:22:24.269 --> 02:22:25.203
STAKEHOLDERS TO CONSIDER THE

02:22:25.270 --> 02:22:27.338
FULL BREADTH OF INDUSTRIAL

02:22:27.405 --> 02:22:29.674
POLICIES THAT CAN THAT CAN GROW

02:22:29.741 --> 02:22:30.842
THESE INDUSTRIES, MAKE ENERGY

02:22:30.909 --> 02:22:32.443
MORE AFFORDABLE AND ACCELERATE

02:22:32.510 --> 02:22:34.312
ON OUR CLIMATE GOALS. THE BILL

02:22:34.379 --> 02:22:36.748
SETS UP A PROCESS FOR CEC TO

02:22:36.814 --> 02:22:38.883
DEVELOP THIS HOLISTIC STRATEGY.

02:22:38.950 --> 02:22:40.285
AND FINALLY, WE KNOW THAT

02:22:40.351 --> 02:22:41.753
THERE'S NO ONGOING PUBLIC PLACE

02:22:41.819 --> 02:22:43.254
TO TRACK DEVELOPMENTS IN THESE

02:22:43.321 --> 02:22:46.424
THREE KEY INDUSTRIES. AND SB 787

02:22:46.491 --> 02:22:47.425
SETS US UP UNDER A CLEAR

02:22:47.492 --> 02:22:51.229
STRUCTURE AND AUTHORITY OF ONE

02:22:51.296 --> 02:22:52.263
LEAD FOR INDUSTRIAL POLICY AT

02:22:52.330 --> 02:22:55.466
THE CDC. SO AS A UNION THAT'S

02:22:55.533 --> 02:22:56.801
HIGHLY INVESTED IN GROWING OUR

02:22:56.868 --> 02:22:59.570
CLEAN ECONOMY AND DOING SO

02:22:59.637 --> 02:23:00.438
STRATEGICALLY, AND ESPECIALLY

02:23:00.505 --> 02:23:02.974
WITH REGARD TO MANUFACTURING, WE

02:23:03.041 --> 02:23:04.809
REQUEST WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST

02:23:04.876 --> 02:23:06.477
YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS BILL. THANK

02:23:06.544 --> 02:23:10.181

MEMBERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

02:23:11.516 --> 02:23:13.117
THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY

02:23:13.184 --> 02:23:16.554
ON BEHALF OF SB 787. MY NAME IS

02:23:16.621 --> 02:23:17.689
AEGON, AND I'M A FELLOW WITH

02:23:17.755 --> 02:23:19.891
CALIFORNIA FORWARD, A STATEWIDE

02:23:19.958 --> 02:23:21.559
NONPROFIT WORKING TO BUILD A NEW

02:23:21.626 --> 02:23:23.194
CALIFORNIA ECONOMY THAT'S

02:23:23.261 --> 02:23:24.629
SUSTAINABLE, RESILIENT AND

02:23:24.696 --> 02:23:25.830
INCLUSIVE ACROSS EVERY REGION OF

02:23:25.897 --> 02:23:28.333
THE STATE. THIS BILL SUPPORTS

02:23:28.399 --> 02:23:30.601
ALL OF THESE GOALS, RECOGNIZING

02:23:30.668 --> 02:23:32.837
CALIFORNIA'S UNIQUE ECONOMIC

02:23:32.904 --> 02:23:34.672
ADVANTAGES ACROSS THREE CRITICAL

02:23:34.739 --> 02:23:37.141
GROWTH INDUSTRIES BUILDING

02:23:37.208 --> 02:23:38.543
DECARBONIZATION, BATTERY

02:23:38.609 --> 02:23:39.777
MANUFACTURING, AND OFFSHORE

02:23:39.844 --> 02:23:41.245
WIND. NOW, YOU MIGHT ASK, WHY DO

02:23:41.312 --> 02:23:43.114
WE NEED THIS BILL? ISN'T

02:23:43.181 --> 02:23:44.148
CALIFORNIA ALREADY A CLEAN

02:23:44.215 --> 02:23:46.184
ENERGY LEADER? WELL, THE REALITY

02:23:46.250 --> 02:23:47.952
IS THAT WHAT WE'VE LED THE WORLD

02:23:48.019 --> 02:23:50.455
ON CLIMATE REGULATION AND ENERGY

02:23:50.521 --> 02:23:51.723
INNOVATION, WE'VE NOT REALIZED

02:23:51.789 --> 02:23:53.625
OUR FULL POTENTIAL TO DRIVE THE

02:23:53.691 --> 02:23:55.693
ENERGY TRANSITION. WE'RE HOME TO

02:23:55.760 --> 02:23:57.662
THE RAW MATERIALS FOR ELECTRIC

02:23:57.729 --> 02:23:58.696
BATTERIES, INCLUDING VAST STORES

02:23:58.763 --> 02:24:00.465
OF LITHIUM IN THE SALTON SEA.

02:24:00.531 --> 02:24:02.100
BUT WE'VE BARELY BEGUN TO BUILD

02:24:02.166 --> 02:24:04.135
THE BATTERY MANUFACTURING

02:24:04.202 --> 02:24:05.036
SECTOR. WE HAVE POWERFUL

02:24:05.103 --> 02:24:06.871
OFFSHORE WINDS, BUT LAG BEHIND

02:24:06.938 --> 02:24:08.639
COUNTRIES WITH SMALLER

02:24:08.706 --> 02:24:10.842
POPULATIONS AND LOWER WIND

02:24:10.908 --> 02:24:12.910
SPEEDS. WE LEAD THE COUNTRY ON

02:24:12.977 --> 02:24:14.746
BUILDING DECARBONIZATION

02:24:14.812 --> 02:24:16.948
REGULATION, BUT NOT IN THE

02:24:17.015 --> 02:24:18.383
MANUFACTURING OF THE MATERIALS

02:24:18.449 --> 02:24:20.585
FOR GREEN BUILDINGS. IN SHORT,

02:24:20.651 --> 02:24:21.953
CALIFORNIA WERE REALLY GOOD AT

02:24:22.020 --> 02:24:23.221
INNOVATION, AND WE'RE GOOD AT

02:24:23.287 --> 02:24:24.956
BUILDING THE CONSUMER BASE FOR

02:24:25.023 --> 02:24:27.025
CLEAN ENERGY THROUGH GOOD SMART

02:24:27.091 --> 02:24:28.559
REGULATION AND LOTS OF

02:24:28.626 --> 02:24:30.395
INSTALLATION. BUT TO LAUNCH

02:24:30.461 --> 02:24:32.063
CALIFORNIA AS A CLEAN ENERGY

02:24:32.130 --> 02:24:33.264
LEADER, WE'VE GOT TO DO BETTER

02:24:33.331 --> 02:24:35.433
ON MANUFACTURING. WE HAVE TO BE

02:24:35.500 --> 02:24:37.101
ABLE TO BUILD OUT THE FULL

02:24:37.168 --> 02:24:39.637
SUPPLY CHAIN OF THE CLEAN ENERGY

02:24:39.704 --> 02:24:41.239
INDUSTRIES. TO ACHIEVE THAT KIND

IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT ONE. IN

02:27:18.229 --> 02:27:21.632
MY FIRST YEAR HERE, I BROUGHT A

02:27:21.699 --> 02:27:24.202

02:27:34.679 --> 02:27:37.615

BEEN HERE LONG ENOUGH THAT I

02:28:09.914 --> 02:28:11.382

CALIFORNIA, AND WE SORT OF LET

02:28:14.418 --> 02:28:15.987
THAT GO AWAY. WHEN YOU LOOK AT

ALL OF THESE BATTERY TECHNOLOGY,

02:28:18.656 --> 02:28:21.025
