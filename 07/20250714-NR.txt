01:24:04.973 --> 01:24:06.107
THIS IS NOW THAT MY THIRD TIME

01:24:06.174 --> 01:24:07.742

APPRECIATE THE ENGAGEMENT. I'M

01:24:13.281 --> 01:24:17.118
HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE'S

01:24:17.185 --> 01:24:18.186
AMENDMENTS. THERE ARE THREE OF

01:24:18.253 --> 01:24:21.489
THEM. ONE IS CHANGING THE SUNSET

01:24:21.556 --> 01:24:25.794

THAT WAS PUT IN BY SENATE.

01:24:35.336 --> 01:24:36.871
ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY WILL

01:24:36.938 --> 01:24:39.140
REMAIN, BUT OTHERWISE THE VAST

01:24:39.207 --> 01:24:40.341
MAJORITY OF THE BILL WILL NOW BE

01:24:40.408 --> 01:24:43.778
A 2040 SUNSET. IN ADDITION, IT

01:24:43.845 --> 01:24:46.648
WILL REVERT THE DEFINITION OF

01:24:46.714 --> 01:24:48.450
RIGHT OF WAY TO EXISTING LAW,

01:24:48.516 --> 01:24:51.286

ARE THE THREE AMENDMENTS THAT WE

01:25:03.064 --> 01:25:09.337

01:25:09.404 --> 01:25:12.574
WILL NOW EXTEND THE SUNSET ON A

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:13.842
STATUTORY CEQA EXEMPTION THAT WE

01:25:13.908 --> 01:25:17.579
ORIGINALLY CREATED IN 2020 AS SB

01:25:17.645 --> 01:25:19.047
288, AND THAT WAS EXTENDED TWO

01:25:19.113 --> 01:25:23.251
YEARS LATER AS SB 9 TO 2. AND

01:25:23.318 --> 01:25:25.620
THIS EXEMPTION APPLIES TO

01:25:25.687 --> 01:25:27.589

HAS BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL, VERY

01:25:46.708 --> 01:25:47.942

01:25:50.445 --> 01:25:51.679

01:26:03.758 --> 01:26:06.027

01:29:10.812 --> 01:29:12.346
ECONOMIST HAS STATED, IF WE

01:29:12.413 --> 01:29:14.015
DON'T HAVE A SOLVENT TRANSIT

01:29:14.082 --> 01:29:15.116
AGENCY, WE WILL NEVER HAVE

01:29:15.183 --> 01:29:17.552
ECONOMIC RECOVERY. THIS REQUIRES

WITHOUT THIS EXEMPTION IN OUR

01:29:26.027 --> 01:29:27.729

01:29:27.795 --> 01:29:30.031
MONEY AND TIME ON THE REVIEW OF

01:29:30.098 --> 01:29:30.698

QUESTIONS ABOUT SOME OF THE

01:32:54.201 --> 01:32:57.505

01:32:57.571 --> 01:32:59.240
THAT YOU YOU WERE ACCEPTING

01:32:59.307 --> 01:33:00.174
THREE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS, AND

01:33:00.241 --> 01:33:01.642
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD GO

01:33:01.709 --> 01:33:03.778
INTO THOSE A BIT MORE, BECAUSE

01:33:03.844 --> 01:33:04.612
THOSE WERE THE ISSUES THAT I

01:33:04.679 --> 01:33:07.214
ACTUALLY HAD WITH THE BILL. SO

01:33:07.281 --> 01:33:11.819
ON THE ON THE FIRST ONE, THE,

01:33:11.886 --> 01:33:14.755
THE DIESEL POWERED HEAVY RAIL

01:33:14.822 --> 01:33:16.490
PROJECT, WHAT WAS THAT INTENDED

01:33:16.557 --> 01:33:19.627
TO COVER? THAT WAS A SENATE

01:33:19.694 --> 01:33:21.996
SUSPENSE AMENDMENT FROM THE

01:33:22.063 --> 01:33:23.998

01:33:24.065 --> 01:33:27.201
IT IS BEING SCALED BACK IN THIS

01:33:27.268 --> 01:33:29.403
IN THIS COMMITTEE. WHAT IS

01:33:29.470 --> 01:33:31.973
SCALED BACK MEAN? LET ME JUMP

01:33:32.039 --> 01:33:35.142
IN. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION,

01:33:35.209 --> 01:33:36.377
ASSEMBLYMEMBER. THE LANGUAGE

01:33:36.444 --> 01:33:38.512
THAT CAME OUT OF THE SENATE

01:33:38.579 --> 01:33:39.680
APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE SAID

01:33:39.747 --> 01:33:41.983
THAT A TIER FOUR LOCOMOTIVE OR

01:33:42.049 --> 01:33:44.285
Tð SYSTEM OPERATING TIER FOUR

01:33:44.352 --> 01:33:44.885
LOCOMOTIVES, WHICH ESSENTIALLY

01:33:44.952 --> 01:33:45.753
THE CLEANEST DIESEL LOCOMOTIVES

01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:48.022
YOU CAN GET, THOSE WOULD ALSO

01:33:48.089 --> 01:33:51.192
QUALIFY FOR WHAT HAD BEEN A ZERO

01:33:51.258 --> 01:33:52.393
EMISSION RAIL EXEMPTION IN THE

01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:54.662
BILL. AFTER WORKING WITH THE

01:33:54.729 --> 01:33:56.330
COMMITTEE AND HEARING SOME

01:33:56.397 --> 01:33:57.999
CONCERNS ABOUT THE ADDITION OR

01:33:58.065 --> 01:33:59.934
THE EXPANSION OF THESE

01:34:00.001 --> 01:34:02.536
PROVISIONS TO A DIESEL FLEET, WE

01:34:02.603 --> 01:34:03.771
WORKED TO SCALE THAT BACK TO

01:34:03.838 --> 01:34:05.673
MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WOULD ONLY

01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:07.274
APPLY IN CERTAIN AIR BASINS,

01:34:07.341 --> 01:34:10.444
WHERE ESSENTIALLY THEY MEET

01:34:10.511 --> 01:34:11.779
VARIOUS ATTAINMENT SLASH NON

01:34:11.846 --> 01:34:13.948
ATTAINMENT LEVELS. AND I BELIEVE

01:34:14.015 --> 01:34:15.850
THE ONLY AGENCY IN THE STATE

01:34:15.916 --> 01:34:17.585
THAT WOULD BE LEFT THAT OPERATES

01:34:17.651 --> 01:34:18.986
A FULLY TIER FOUR DIESEL

01:34:19.053 --> 01:34:20.554
LOCOMOTIVE SYSTEM IS THE

01:34:20.621 --> 01:34:21.555
SONOMA-MARIN AREA RAPID TRANSIT

01:34:21.622 --> 01:34:23.791
RAIL SYSTEM. BUT IF OTHERS WERE

01:34:23.858 --> 01:34:26.627
TO GET TO A FULLY TIER FOUR

01:34:26.694 --> 01:34:27.695
DIESEL SYSTEM LIKE METROLINK

01:34:27.762 --> 01:34:30.965
WILL SOMEDAY AND THEY CAN MEET

01:34:31.032 --> 01:34:32.666
THE NON-ATTAINMENT REQUIREMENTS,

01:34:32.733 --> 01:34:35.469
THEN THEY COULD ALSO BE SUBJECT

01:34:35.536 --> 01:34:36.437
TO THE REQUIREMENTS OR THE

01:34:36.504 --> 01:34:38.372
PERMISSIONS IN THE BILL, I

01:34:38.439 --> 01:34:39.540
GUESS. BUT AREN'T YOU

01:34:39.607 --> 01:34:45.212
INCENTIVIZING? NON TIER FOUR

01:34:45.279 --> 01:34:47.848
PURCHASES WITH THIS? I MEAN,

01:34:47.915 --> 01:34:49.617
BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE THE IT'S

01:34:49.683 --> 01:34:51.752
NOT LIKE THE IT'S NOT LIKE THE

01:34:51.819 --> 01:34:54.688
EQUIPMENT IS GOING TO BE

01:34:54.755 --> 01:34:55.790
ELIMINATED IN TEN YEARS. I MEAN

01:34:55.856 --> 01:34:57.892
YOU'RE MAKING LONG TERM

01:34:57.958 --> 01:34:59.393
PURCHASING DECISIONS AND I JUST

01:34:59.460 --> 01:35:02.263
HAVE A LOT OF HEARTBURN DOING

01:35:02.329 --> 01:35:04.298
ANYTHING THAT'S ACTUALLY EXEMPT

01:35:04.365 --> 01:35:06.167
FROM SEQUA DIESEL POWERED HEAVY

01:35:06.233 --> 01:35:09.170
RAIL PROJECTS. RIGHT. WE

01:35:09.236 --> 01:35:10.538
WOULDN'T THEY WOULD NOT. IF YOU

01:35:10.604 --> 01:35:11.705
RAN A TIER THREE SYSTEM, FOR

01:35:11.772 --> 01:35:13.507
EXAMPLE, YOU WOULD RECEIVE NO

01:35:13.574 --> 01:35:14.508
BENEFITS FROM THIS BILL. YOU

01:35:14.575 --> 01:35:15.743
WOULD STILL HAVE TO COMPLY WITH

01:35:15.810 --> 01:35:16.811
THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL

01:35:16.877 --> 01:35:18.479
QUALITY ACT AS IT IS TODAY,

01:35:18.546 --> 01:35:19.447
MEANING YOU WOULD HAVE TO DO ALL

01:35:19.513 --> 01:35:20.714
THE ANALYSIS THAT'S REQUIRED

01:35:20.781 --> 01:35:22.349
UNDER THEIR THE AIR

01:35:22.416 --> 01:35:24.518
DEVELOPMENTS, ETC. THE ONLY

01:35:24.585 --> 01:35:25.619
LOCOMOTIVE SYSTEM THAT WOULD BE

01:35:25.686 --> 01:35:27.588
ALLOWED IS A TIER FOUR FULLY.

01:35:27.655 --> 01:35:28.823
AND THAT'S JUST THAT ONE RAIL

01:35:28.889 --> 01:35:29.990
OPERATOR. BUT THERE STILL

01:35:30.057 --> 01:35:31.525
WOULDN'T BE ZERO EMISSION. THEY

01:35:31.592 --> 01:35:33.894
WOULD NOT QUALIFY, THEY WOULD BE

01:35:33.961 --> 01:35:36.230
ZERO EMISSION. RIGHT. SO IN SOME

01:35:36.297 --> 01:35:37.765
INSTANCES YOU MIGHT SAY IT MIGHT

01:35:37.832 --> 01:35:40.034
INCENTIVIZE FOLKS TO GO TO THE

01:35:40.101 --> 01:35:40.634
CLEANEST LOCOMOTIVE TYPE THERE

01:35:40.701 --> 01:35:44.572
IS OUT THERE IN A POSITIVE WAY.

01:35:44.638 --> 01:35:45.639
BUT YOU WOULDN'T BE

01:35:45.706 --> 01:35:46.640
INCENTIVIZING FOLKS TO GO

01:35:46.707 --> 01:35:48.409
BACKWARDS. AND WHY DO YOU NEED

01:35:48.476 --> 01:35:50.377
THAT? I MEAN, WHY WHY SHOULD NOT

01:35:50.444 --> 01:35:53.114
THE PUBLIC HAVE THE ABILITY TO

01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:54.148
UNDERSTAND WHETHER OR NOT DIESEL

01:35:54.215 --> 01:35:55.950
EMISSIONS GOING THROUGH THEIR

01:35:56.016 --> 01:35:57.818
NEIGHBORHOODS ARE GOING TO HAVE

01:35:57.885 --> 01:35:59.520
SOME KIND OF PUBLIC SAFETY

01:35:59.587 --> 01:36:01.622
IMPACT THAT CEQA WOULD PROVIDE?

01:36:01.689 --> 01:36:05.726
AS NOTED, THIS WAS. SENATE

01:36:05.793 --> 01:36:06.393
APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE

01:36:06.460 --> 01:36:09.630
SUSPENSE AMENDMENT. SAY THAT.

01:36:09.697 --> 01:36:12.166
AND I WILL ALSO IF A PROJECT IS

01:36:12.233 --> 01:36:13.968
$100 MILLION OR MORE, WHICH ANY

01:36:14.034 --> 01:36:15.736
RAIL PROJECT IS GOING TO BE,

01:36:15.803 --> 01:36:18.706
THERE ARE PUBLIC MEETING

01:36:18.772 --> 01:36:20.274
REQUIREMENTS IN THE BILL AS

01:36:20.341 --> 01:36:24.111
WELL. WOULD YOU WOULD YOU WOULD

01:36:24.178 --> 01:36:26.113
YOU BE OPEN TO JUST TAKING THAT

01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:27.214
THAT PART OF THE EXEMPTION? I

01:36:27.281 --> 01:36:29.150
KNOW THAT IT CAME OUT OF SENATE

01:36:29.216 --> 01:36:30.885
APPROPRIATIONS, BUT I MEAN, I'M

01:36:30.951 --> 01:36:32.786
NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO VOTE FOR

01:36:32.853 --> 01:36:34.889
THIS WITH THIS IN IT ON WHEN

01:36:34.955 --> 01:36:37.558
IT'S ON THE FLOOR. THAT WAS A

01:36:37.625 --> 01:36:38.759
APPROPRIATIONS SUSPENSE

01:36:38.826 --> 01:36:40.494
AMENDMENT WAS NOT AN AMENDMENT.

01:36:40.561 --> 01:36:44.498
AND SO I'M I THAT'S NOT A I GET

01:36:44.565 --> 01:36:45.666
THAT'S NOT A COMMITMENT THAT I

01:36:45.733 --> 01:36:48.802
CAN MAKE TO YOU OKAY. SO THE

01:36:48.869 --> 01:36:50.604
OTHER THE OTHER. BUT I DO WANT

01:36:50.671 --> 01:36:52.439
TO JUST NOTE THAT WORKING WITH

01:36:52.506 --> 01:36:53.674
THE COMMITTEE, IT WAS SCALED

01:36:53.741 --> 01:36:56.377
BACK AND I SAW THAT I THINK IT'S

01:36:56.443 --> 01:36:59.980
BETTER JUST SO THE OTHER ISSUE

01:37:00.047 --> 01:37:01.849
RELATED TO THE RIGHT OF WAY. SO

01:37:01.916 --> 01:37:04.285
WHAT IS WHAT IS THE WHAT IS THE

01:37:04.351 --> 01:37:06.187
NEW LANGUAGE ON THE RIGHT OF

01:37:06.253 --> 01:37:10.090
WAY. SO THE IN 71 WE PROPOSED AN

01:37:10.157 --> 01:37:11.091
EXPANSION OF THE DEFINITION OF

01:37:11.158 --> 01:37:12.826
RIGHT OF WAY IN THE COMMITTEE

01:37:12.893 --> 01:37:15.429
AMENDMENT. IT SCALED BACK TO THE

01:37:15.496 --> 01:37:16.931
EXISTING DEFINITION AND EXISTING

01:37:16.997 --> 01:37:18.966
LAW OF RIGHT OF WAY, WITH SOME

01:37:19.033 --> 01:37:20.868
ADDITIONAL PROTECTION FOR

01:37:20.935 --> 01:37:23.304
UTILITY ASSETS. SO IT'S A LITTLE

01:37:23.370 --> 01:37:24.772
MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN EXISTING

01:37:24.838 --> 01:37:30.945
LAW, RIGHT. THE CURRENT BILL

01:37:31.011 --> 01:37:33.847
WOULD WOULD IT IT WOULD EXEMPT

01:37:33.914 --> 01:37:36.784
BUS LANE SORT OF CONVERSIONS

01:37:36.850 --> 01:37:39.587
WOULDN'T IT. YES. THAT'S THAT'S

01:37:39.653 --> 01:37:42.389
EXISTING LAW I GET THAT. BUT I'M

01:37:42.456 --> 01:37:44.625
GETTING COMMENTS FROM MY

01:37:44.692 --> 01:37:46.427
CONSTITUENTS ABOUT THIS BILL

01:37:46.493 --> 01:37:47.528
BECAUSE THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT

01:37:47.595 --> 01:37:49.196
THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THIS AND

01:37:49.263 --> 01:37:51.498
SB 79. AND WHAT THEY'RE

01:37:51.565 --> 01:37:53.534
CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT NOW WE

01:37:53.601 --> 01:37:56.237
CAN ACTUALLY GO THROUGH THAT.

01:37:56.303 --> 01:37:57.871
THERE'S A CEQA EXEMPTION FOR BUS

01:37:57.938 --> 01:38:00.507
LANE CONVERSION, AND BASICALLY

01:38:00.574 --> 01:38:05.045
THERE WOULD BE NO PROTECTION IN

01:38:05.112 --> 01:38:08.048
IN BUS LANES BEING CONVERTED TO

01:38:08.115 --> 01:38:09.850
LANES WITH STOPS THAT WOULD

01:38:09.917 --> 01:38:11.785
QUALIFY FOR EITHER THE HALF MILE

01:38:11.852 --> 01:38:18.092
OR THE QUARTER MILE DEVELOPMENT.

01:38:18.158 --> 01:38:20.594
AUTHORIZATION UNDER SB 79. AND

01:38:20.661 --> 01:38:23.497
SO I JUST WANT TO FLAG THAT FOR

01:38:23.564 --> 01:38:25.933
ME. I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.601
TODAY, BUT WHETHER I SUPPORT

01:38:27.668 --> 01:38:30.137
THIS ON THE FLOOR WILL DEPEND ON

01:38:30.204 --> 01:38:33.540
WHERE SB 79 LANDS. YEAH, I MEAN,

01:38:33.607 --> 01:38:37.611
CITIES, CITIES, TRANSIT AGENCIES

01:38:37.678 --> 01:38:40.047
MAKE PUBLIC DECISIONS ABOUT

01:38:40.114 --> 01:38:41.448
WHETHER TO BUILD SUBWAYS,

01:38:41.515 --> 01:38:42.950
WHETHER TO BUILD LIGHT RAIL,

01:38:43.017 --> 01:38:45.352
WHETHER TO DO BUS RAPID TRANSIT.

01:38:45.419 --> 01:38:46.920
AND THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE

01:38:46.987 --> 01:38:50.291
NORMAL PROCESS OF DOING THAT.

01:38:50.357 --> 01:38:53.694
AND THEY HAVE TO. ALLOCATE

01:38:53.761 --> 01:38:56.964
PUBLIC MONEY. AND THEY'RE EITHER

01:38:57.031 --> 01:38:59.533
CITY COUNCILS OR TRANSIT

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:00.968
AGENCIES TEND TO HAVE ELECTED

01:39:01.035 --> 01:39:03.070
OFFICIALS IN THEIR GOVERNING

01:39:03.137 --> 01:39:05.272
BOARD. AND SO THOSE ARE

01:39:05.339 --> 01:39:06.307
POLITICAL DECISIONS THAT ARE

01:39:06.373 --> 01:39:08.042
MADE ABOUT WHETHER TO CREATE

01:39:08.108 --> 01:39:09.877
CERTAIN KINDS OF PUBLIC

01:39:09.943 --> 01:39:13.113
TRANSPORTATION. AND SO THAT THAT

01:39:13.180 --> 01:39:15.049
WON'T CHANGE. YEAH, IT WON'T

01:39:15.115 --> 01:39:17.217
CHANGE FROM THIS. BUT WHAT'S THE

01:39:17.284 --> 01:39:18.652
PROCESS THAT ALLOWS THE PUBLIC

01:39:18.719 --> 01:39:20.521
TO SORT OF WEIGH IN ON THAT? YOU

01:39:20.587 --> 01:39:22.589
KNOW, IF YOU BASICALLY CAN

01:39:22.656 --> 01:39:23.624
CONVERT A BUS LANE IN THEIR

01:39:23.691 --> 01:39:24.692
COMMUNITY TO ONE THAT NOW

01:39:24.758 --> 01:39:25.893
TRIGGERS AN ABILITY TO SORT OF

01:39:25.959 --> 01:39:30.097
PUT IN 65 FOOT BUILDINGS IN THE

01:39:30.164 --> 01:39:31.865
MIDDLE OF CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS,

01:39:31.932 --> 01:39:33.334
THAT'S IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE

01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:35.069
WE'RE ELIMINATING A LOT OF THE

01:39:35.135 --> 01:39:37.638
PUBLIC PROCESSES THAT ALLOW THE

01:39:37.705 --> 01:39:39.740
PUBLIC TO COME IN AND HAVE. I

01:39:39.807 --> 01:39:41.308
MEAN, IT'S NOT THE ONLY PUBLIC

01:39:41.375 --> 01:39:43.110
PROCESS THERE WHEN A, WHEN AN

01:39:43.177 --> 01:39:44.878
AGENCY OR A CITY IS APPROVING,

01:39:44.945 --> 01:39:46.280
ESPECIALLY SOMETHING AS LARGE AS

01:39:46.347 --> 01:39:49.149
A, YOU KNOW, A BIG TRANSIT

01:39:49.216 --> 01:39:50.651
PROJECT THAT GOES THROUGH ITS

01:39:50.718 --> 01:39:52.519
OWN PUBLIC PROCESS, IN ADDITION

01:39:52.586 --> 01:39:55.222
TO THE FACT THAT IN THIS BILL,

01:39:55.289 --> 01:39:55.856
IF THE PROJECT IS $100 MILLION

01:39:55.923 --> 01:39:58.158
OR MORE, WHICH THESE PROJECTS

01:39:58.225 --> 01:39:59.626
WILL, UNFORTUNATELY I WISH THEY

01:39:59.693 --> 01:40:00.828
WERE LESS LESS THAN THAT. BUT

01:40:00.894 --> 01:40:02.896
THEY'RE NOT. THEY'RE ALL THERE

01:40:02.963 --> 01:40:04.431
ARE PUBLIC MEETING REQUIREMENTS

01:40:04.498 --> 01:40:06.567
IN THE BILL. YEAH. WELL, I MEAN,

01:40:06.633 --> 01:40:08.535
I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL

01:40:08.602 --> 01:40:11.705
TODAY, BUT I'M SORT OF FLAGGING

01:40:11.772 --> 01:40:14.308
THAT, YOU KNOW, LOOKING AT THE

01:40:14.375 --> 01:40:15.943
TOTALITY OF SORT OF WHAT HAS

01:40:16.009 --> 01:40:18.579
MOVED THROUGH BOTH OF THE HOUSES

01:40:18.645 --> 01:40:19.847
OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THIS

01:40:19.913 --> 01:40:23.384
CYCLE, WHICH HAVE, YOU KNOW,

01:40:23.450 --> 01:40:25.219
RESULTED IN GOOD GOALS TO

01:40:25.285 --> 01:40:26.120
STREAMLINE HOUSING AND OTHER

01:40:26.186 --> 01:40:29.656
THINGS. THE, THE, THE, THE

01:40:29.723 --> 01:40:31.592
COMBINED EFFECT OF THOSE IS

01:40:31.658 --> 01:40:33.327
GETTING ME VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

01:40:33.394 --> 01:40:36.196
THE LACK OF ANY KIND OF PUBLIC

01:40:36.263 --> 01:40:38.532
PROCESS FOR PEOPLE TO EXPRESS

01:40:38.599 --> 01:40:40.367
THEIR VIEWS ON THINGS THAT MAY

01:40:40.434 --> 01:40:41.702
BE IMPACTING THEM. BUT BUT, YOU

01:40:41.769 --> 01:40:43.404
KNOW, GIVEN THAT THIS IS ALREADY

01:40:43.470 --> 01:40:45.472
MOST OF THIS IS ALREADY IN

01:40:45.539 --> 01:40:47.040
PLACE. AND WITH THE CONCERNS

01:40:47.107 --> 01:40:47.841
THAT I'VE EXPRESSED RELATED TO

01:40:47.908 --> 01:40:49.843
THE DIESEL TRUCKS IN THE PUBLIC

01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:52.880
RIGHT OF WAY. SO THE OTHER THING

01:40:52.946 --> 01:40:54.615
ON THE RIGHT OF WAY, IT'S

01:40:54.681 --> 01:40:55.516
EXISTING. SO YOU WOULDN'T BE

01:40:55.582 --> 01:40:59.253
ABLE TO USE UTILITY UTILITY

01:40:59.319 --> 01:41:03.690
RIGHTS OF WAY. YEAH. SO WHAT WE

01:41:03.757 --> 01:41:05.359
HAD ATTEMPTED TO DO WAS THERE

01:41:05.426 --> 01:41:07.528
ARE THREE SECTIONS IN THE BILL

01:41:07.594 --> 01:41:08.195
THAT ALL HAVE DIFFERENT

01:41:08.262 --> 01:41:09.296
DISTINCTIONS OF WHAT RIGHT OF

01:41:09.363 --> 01:41:12.366
WAY THE PROJECTS CAN BE BUILT ON

01:41:12.433 --> 01:41:13.300
FOR BUS LANE CONVERSIONS, ETC.

01:41:13.367 --> 01:41:15.469
THEY NEED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC

01:41:15.536 --> 01:41:16.970
RIGHT OF WAY OR THE HIGHWAY

01:41:17.037 --> 01:41:18.338
RIGHT OF WAY FOR RAIL PROJECTS.

01:41:18.405 --> 01:41:19.740
THEY NEED TO BE IN THE RAIL

01:41:19.807 --> 01:41:21.408
RIGHT OF WAY OR THE HIGHWAY

01:41:21.475 --> 01:41:22.643
RIGHT OF WAY FOR UTILITY

01:41:22.709 --> 01:41:24.411
PROJECTS. THEY NEED TO BE ON

01:41:24.478 --> 01:41:26.413
LAND OWNED BY THE PUBLIC AGENCY,

01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:27.981
OR ON LAND OWNED BY A PUBLIC OR

01:41:28.048 --> 01:41:28.749
PRIVATE UTILITY. WE HAD

01:41:28.816 --> 01:41:30.617
ATTEMPTED TO MAKE SORT OF A

01:41:30.684 --> 01:41:32.352
CATCHALL THAT SAID, IF YOU'RE

01:41:32.419 --> 01:41:33.454
DOING ONE OF THESE THREE BUCKETS

01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:34.855
OR ONE OF THE PROJECTS IN THESE

01:41:34.922 --> 01:41:35.522
THREE BUCKETS, THEN FOLLOW THESE

01:41:35.589 --> 01:41:37.524
RIGHT OF WAY ISSUES. THE

01:41:37.591 --> 01:41:38.091
COMMITTEE STAFF RIGHTFULLY

01:41:38.158 --> 01:41:40.227
POINTED OUT THAT THERE COULD BE

01:41:40.294 --> 01:41:40.894
SOME ISSUES HERE RELATED TO THE

01:41:40.961 --> 01:41:42.529
MASSIVE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY THAT

01:41:42.596 --> 01:41:43.964
UTILITIES OWN THAT MAY BE

01:41:44.031 --> 01:41:45.699
OUTSIDE OF THOSE URBAN AREAS.

01:41:45.766 --> 01:41:46.834
WE'RE TRYING TO INCENTIVIZE

01:41:46.900 --> 01:41:47.835
THESE PROJECTS. AND SO WHAT WE

01:41:47.901 --> 01:41:49.603
DID WAS WE PUT EVERYTHING BACK

01:41:49.670 --> 01:41:51.505
IN PLACE AS IT WAS OR AS IT IS

01:41:51.572 --> 01:41:53.273
TODAY IN THE LAW. AND THEN WE

01:41:53.340 --> 01:41:54.241
CONDITIONED THAT THOSE UTILITY

01:41:54.308 --> 01:41:56.376
SITES MUST BE IN THE URBAN AREA.

01:41:56.443 --> 01:41:57.411
SO THAT'S THE GUARDRAIL THAT THE

01:41:57.478 --> 01:41:59.012
SENATOR MENTIONED ON THOSE.

01:41:59.079 --> 01:42:01.048
GREAT. WELL, I'M GOING TO VOTE

01:42:01.114 --> 01:42:02.149
TODAY, BUT RESERVE MY RIGHT TO

01:42:02.216 --> 01:42:04.318
TAKE A LOOK AT IT WHEN IT GETS

01:42:04.384 --> 01:42:06.587
TO THE FLOOR. ABSOLUTELY. MR.

01:42:06.653 --> 01:42:10.324
MURATSUCHI, THANK YOU. I WASN'T

01:42:10.390 --> 01:42:13.727
GOING TO SPEAK, BUT FOLLOWING MY

01:42:13.794 --> 01:42:15.329
COLLEAGUE FROM WEST HOLLYWOOD'S

01:42:15.395 --> 01:42:21.268
LINE OF QUESTIONING. YEAH, I AM

01:42:21.335 --> 01:42:22.870
GETTING INCREASINGLY CONCERNED

01:42:22.936 --> 01:42:24.872
ABOUT ALL THESE CEQA EXEMPTIONS.

01:42:24.938 --> 01:42:27.107
WE PASSED THE EXEMPTION FOR

01:42:27.174 --> 01:42:28.842
ADVANCED MANUFACTURING, AND NOW

01:42:28.909 --> 01:42:31.745
WE'RE PASSING A SEQUEL EXEMPTION

01:42:31.812 --> 01:42:33.881
FOR DIESEL ENGINES. I MEAN,

01:42:33.947 --> 01:42:36.850
WHERE DO WE DRAW THE LINE?

01:42:36.917 --> 01:42:39.553
SENATOR? WE DRAW THE LINE.

01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:41.121
WHEREVER THE LEGISLATURE DECIDES

01:42:41.188 --> 01:42:43.624
TO DRAW THE LINE IS THE IS THE

01:42:43.690 --> 01:42:46.260
ANSWER. THAT IS A VERY, VERY

01:42:46.326 --> 01:42:49.062
TINY PIECE OF THIS BILL. AND AS

01:42:49.129 --> 01:42:52.232
AS MR. ROBINSON MENTIONED, IT

01:42:52.299 --> 01:42:54.768
COVERS ONE RAIL SYSTEM IN THE

01:42:54.835 --> 01:42:57.404
ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND

01:42:57.471 --> 01:42:58.872
IN FACT, THAT COULD CHANGE IN

01:42:58.939 --> 01:43:00.807
THE FUTURE. BUT THAT'S THAT'S

01:43:00.874 --> 01:43:02.776
THE STATE OF THE WORLD RIGHT

01:43:02.843 --> 01:43:04.678
NOW. AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF

01:43:04.745 --> 01:43:06.747
THIS BILL, THIS HAS BEEN INVOKED

01:43:06.813 --> 01:43:09.016
ABOUT 100 TIMES IN THE LAST FIVE

01:43:09.082 --> 01:43:11.752
YEARS. AND IT'S BEEN, YOU KNOW,

01:43:11.818 --> 01:43:13.387
ZERO EMISSION BUS SERVICE, ZERO

01:43:13.453 --> 01:43:15.789
EMISSION LIGHT RAIL SERVICE, YOU

01:43:15.856 --> 01:43:17.157
KNOW, BIKE SAFETY

01:43:17.224 --> 01:43:18.692
INFRASTRUCTURE, PEDESTRIAN

01:43:18.759 --> 01:43:21.194
SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS. YOU KNOW,

01:43:21.261 --> 01:43:22.362
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE

01:43:22.429 --> 01:43:24.131
INCLUDING NOW, BUS SHELTERS,

01:43:24.197 --> 01:43:25.566
JUST THIS IS ALL THESE ARE ALL

01:43:25.632 --> 01:43:26.700
THINGS THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD

01:43:26.767 --> 01:43:29.836
SAY ARE REALLY GOOD AND ARE VERY

01:43:29.903 --> 01:43:31.238
ENVIRONMENTALLY BENEFICIAL. AND

01:43:31.305 --> 01:43:32.973
THAT'S WHY THE EXEMPTION WAS

01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:34.441
CREATED. AND THIS COMMITTEE

01:43:34.508 --> 01:43:36.176
PASSED IT OUT BACK IN 2020. I

01:43:36.243 --> 01:43:37.644
THINK YOU WERE THERE AT THE

01:43:37.711 --> 01:43:39.513
TIME. WE GO BACK A LONG WAY

01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:40.581
TOGETHER IN THIS COMMITTEE, AND

01:43:40.647 --> 01:43:42.716
THEN THAT'S WHY IT'S BEEN

01:43:42.783 --> 01:43:43.483
GETTING BROAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT

01:43:43.550 --> 01:43:46.253
AS WELL. AND I WOULD JUST SAY ON

01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:46.987
ASSEMBLYMEMBER MURATSUCHI, IF

01:43:47.054 --> 01:43:49.890
YOU PERMIT ME ON THE DIESEL

01:43:49.957 --> 01:43:51.725
LOCOMOTIVES, THE DIESEL

01:43:51.792 --> 01:43:52.492
LOCOMOTIVES THAT ARE

01:43:52.559 --> 01:43:53.760
PARTICULARLY CALLED OUT IN THIS

01:43:53.827 --> 01:43:54.661
BILL, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ONLY

01:43:54.728 --> 01:43:55.862
THE PASSENGER RAIL LOCOMOTIVES.

01:43:55.929 --> 01:43:56.997
SO THAT'S WE'RE NOT TALKING

01:43:57.064 --> 01:43:57.965
ABOUT FREIGHT LOCOMOTIVES OR

01:43:58.031 --> 01:44:00.767
ANYTHING LIKE THAT. THEY ARE THE

01:44:00.834 --> 01:44:02.536
CLEANEST OF THE CLEAN. IN FACT,

01:44:02.603 --> 01:44:04.104
A TIER FOUR LOCOMOTIVE WOULD

01:44:04.171 --> 01:44:05.606
HAVE PUT YOU ON A COMPLIANCE

01:44:05.672 --> 01:44:07.207
PATHWAY AND CARBS IN USE

01:44:07.274 --> 01:44:07.808
LOCOMOTIVE REGULATION, THAT'S

01:44:07.874 --> 01:44:09.676
HOW CLEAN THOSE LOCOMOTIVES ARE.

01:44:09.743 --> 01:44:12.212
AND FRANKLY, THAT IS WHAT IS AT

01:44:12.279 --> 01:44:13.747
THE DISPOSAL OF THE TRANSIT

01:44:13.814 --> 01:44:14.781
OPERATORS TODAY. BECAUSE IF YOU

01:44:14.848 --> 01:44:16.950
THINK ABOUT IN YOUR AREA, RIGHT,

01:44:17.017 --> 01:44:19.152
PUTTING OVERHEAD CATENARY ON THE

01:44:19.219 --> 01:44:20.520
METROLINK SYSTEM, THAT IS

01:44:20.587 --> 01:44:21.722
SOMETHING THAT I KNOW HAS BEEN

01:44:21.788 --> 01:44:23.023
EXPLORED BUT IS VERY COSTLY,

01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:24.925
VERY THAT'S GOING TO BE, YOU

01:44:24.992 --> 01:44:25.993
KNOW, DECADES IF NOT CENTURIES

01:44:26.059 --> 01:44:28.729
OUT. RIGHT. AND SO WHEN WE LOOK

01:44:28.795 --> 01:44:30.130
AT THE OPTIONS, THAT'S WHERE

01:44:30.197 --> 01:44:31.465
MOST AGENCIES ARE GOING THESE

01:44:31.531 --> 01:44:32.799
DAYS. IS PURCHASING THOSE TIER

01:44:32.866 --> 01:44:34.601
FOURS OR PILOTING HYDROGEN

01:44:34.668 --> 01:44:36.470
LOCOMOTIVES OR BATTERY ELECTRIC

01:44:36.536 --> 01:44:38.138
LOCOMOTIVES. BUT THE DELIVERY OF

01:44:38.205 --> 01:44:40.641
THOSE IS YEARS IN THE FUTURE.

01:44:40.707 --> 01:44:42.843
AND SO IT'S IT WOULD BE SOME

01:44:42.909 --> 01:44:44.311
TIME BEFORE YOU WOULD HAVE

01:44:44.378 --> 01:44:45.345
ANOTHER PUBLIC TRANSIT OPERATOR

01:44:45.412 --> 01:44:46.580
THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE

01:44:46.647 --> 01:44:48.615
ADVANTAGE OF THIS. MY GUESS IS

01:44:48.682 --> 01:44:51.118
WE WOULD BE AT THAT 2040 SUNSET

01:44:51.184 --> 01:44:51.718
BEFORE THAT HAPPENED. I JUST

01:44:51.785 --> 01:44:53.720
WANT TO CLARIFY FOR THE RECORD,

01:44:53.787 --> 01:44:56.790
I, I, I AM PRETTY SURE I VOTED

01:44:56.857 --> 01:45:00.427
FOR THE PREVIOUS TRANSIT CEQA

01:45:00.494 --> 01:45:02.362
EXEMPTIONS. YOU KNOW, I EVEN

01:45:02.429 --> 01:45:05.198
VOTED FOR MISS WICKS HOUSING

01:45:05.265 --> 01:45:09.069
CEQA EXEMPTION. GO FIGURE THAT.

01:45:09.136 --> 01:45:13.106
BUT YEAH, I JUST WANT TO

01:45:13.173 --> 01:45:16.677
REGISTER MY CONCERN THAT WE IT'S

01:45:16.743 --> 01:45:20.213
THE WHOLE WHAT IS IT COTTAGE

01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:23.050
CHEESE ANALOGY. YOU KNOW, AT

01:45:23.116 --> 01:45:25.352
WHAT POINT DO WE HAVE MORE HOLES

01:45:25.419 --> 01:45:29.589
THAN CHEESE. FOR THE RECORD MY

01:45:29.656 --> 01:45:31.825
THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF MY OTHER

01:45:31.892 --> 01:45:35.696
BILL WAS TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE

01:45:35.762 --> 01:45:38.498
CHEESE, NOT THE HOLES. AND THIS,

01:45:38.565 --> 01:45:40.333
THIS THE THERE'S A LOT OF

01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:42.235
PRESSURE IN THIS LEGISLATURE IN

01:45:42.302 --> 01:45:43.704
GENERAL IN BOTH HOUSES TO GO

01:45:43.770 --> 01:45:46.139
TOWARDS EXEMPTIONS INSTEAD OF

01:45:46.206 --> 01:45:48.275
CHANGING CEQA ITSELF. AND THAT'S

01:45:48.341 --> 01:45:50.310
JUST IS WHAT IT IS. IT'S JUST A

01:45:50.377 --> 01:45:54.448
DYNAMIC. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?

01:45:54.514 --> 01:45:57.217
COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

01:45:57.284 --> 01:46:00.887
ARE YOU SURE, MR. ELLIS? OKAY.

01:46:00.954 --> 01:46:03.457
MR. CONNELLY YEAH, MAYBE JUST A

01:46:03.523 --> 01:46:06.660
CLARIFICATION AS WELL. IT SOUNDS

01:46:06.727 --> 01:46:10.363
LIKE DUE TO THE AMENDMENTS, THIS

01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:13.533
WOULD ONLY APPLY IN AIR BASINS

01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:16.036
AS WELL. IS THAT WHAT DOES THAT

01:46:16.103 --> 01:46:18.739
MEAN? YEAH, IF YOU CAN EXPLAIN

01:46:18.805 --> 01:46:21.908
WHAT THAT MEANS, I'LL TRY TO GET

01:46:21.975 --> 01:46:26.446
THIS RIGHT. LAWRENCE. IN ORDER

01:46:26.513 --> 01:46:30.450
TO USE THE TIER FOUR LOCOMOTIVE

01:46:30.517 --> 01:46:31.985
PERMIT NATURE OF THE BILL.

01:46:32.052 --> 01:46:34.421
RIGHT. THAT SAYS YOU CAN DO

01:46:34.488 --> 01:46:36.256
STATIONS OR SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS

01:46:36.323 --> 01:46:38.391
ON TIER FOUR SYSTEMS ENTIRELY,

01:46:38.458 --> 01:46:40.560
100% EXCLUSIVELY USED BY TIER

01:46:40.627 --> 01:46:42.429
FOUR LOCOMOTIVES. YOU HAVE TO BE

01:46:42.496 --> 01:46:46.566
IN AN AIR BASIN THAT IS SEVERELY

01:46:46.633 --> 01:46:48.535
OR YOU CAN'T BE IN A BASIN THAT

01:46:48.602 --> 01:46:50.704
IS SEVERELY, EXTREMELY. AND I

01:46:50.771 --> 01:46:51.738
FORGOT THE THIRD ONE. LAWRENCE.

01:46:51.805 --> 01:46:54.975
EXCUSE ME. SERIOUS, SERIOUS,

01:46:55.041 --> 01:46:58.745
SEVERE OR EXTREME? AS SCORED BY

01:46:58.812 --> 01:47:07.187
THE EPA. THANK YOU. WOULD YOU

01:47:07.254 --> 01:47:09.122
LIKE TO CLOSE, SENATOR? I THINK

01:47:09.189 --> 01:47:10.824
A LOT HAS BEEN SAID, AND I

01:47:10.891 --> 01:47:12.692
APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION,

01:47:12.759 --> 01:47:14.394
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE

01:47:14.461 --> 01:47:15.428
VOTE. THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE

01:47:15.495 --> 01:47:18.465
THE SENATOR AND THE SENATE'S

01:47:18.532 --> 01:47:22.269
WILLINGNESS TO SCALE UP THE TIER

01:47:22.335 --> 01:47:23.503
FOUR LOCOMOTIVES BACK QUITE A

01:47:23.570 --> 01:47:26.439
BIT SERIOUS AND SEVERE, EXTREME

01:47:26.506 --> 01:47:28.108
FOR FOLKS WHO AREN'T SURE

01:47:28.175 --> 01:47:29.509
EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS. THAT

01:47:29.576 --> 01:47:32.078
MEANS QCM-D. IT MEANS FRESNO. IT

01:47:32.145 --> 01:47:33.446
MEANS SOME OF THE WORST AIR

01:47:33.513 --> 01:47:34.948
QUALITY SPOTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA,

01:47:35.015 --> 01:47:36.750
WHICH WERE THE PLACES THAT WE

01:47:36.817 --> 01:47:40.020
WERE, YOU KNOW, CONSISTENT ON

01:47:40.086 --> 01:47:41.388
PROTECTING EVEN THROUGH THIS

01:47:41.454 --> 01:47:42.889
PROCESS. THIS BILL HAS A DUE

01:47:42.956 --> 01:47:43.757
PASS RECOMMENDATION FROM THE

01:47:43.824 --> 01:47:44.858

CALL THE ROLL MOTION IS DO PASS,

01:47:49.529 --> 01:47:51.698
AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS.

CHOLERA I MURATSUCHI.

01:48:07.214 --> 01:48:08.849
MURATSUCHI. NOT VOTING. PELLERIN

01:48:08.915 --> 01:48:13.086
I PELLERIN I SHULTZ. WICKS.

01:48:13.153 --> 01:48:17.891
ZIPPER. ZIPPER I. SENATOR THAT

01:48:17.958 --> 01:48:20.227
CHEESE'S OUT. THANK YOU. THANK

01:48:20.293 --> 01:48:22.429
THANK YOU AGAIN, MR. CHAIR.

THANK YOU. ABSOLUTELY. SENATOR

01:48:24.731 --> 01:48:36.543
STERN, COME ON DOWN. THANK YOU.

01:48:36.610 --> 01:48:40.213
TEN YEARS. I'LL BE OFF. WHENEVER

01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:41.314
YOU'RE READY. ALL RIGHT. THANK

01:48:41.381 --> 01:48:45.485
YOU, MR. CHAIR. MEMBERS, SB 614

01:48:45.552 --> 01:48:48.488
IS A BILL ON PIPELINE SAFETY

01:48:48.555 --> 01:48:50.190
REGARDING CARBON DIOXIDE

01:48:50.257 --> 01:48:51.858
PIPELINES. WE'VE BEEN WORKING

01:48:51.925 --> 01:48:54.127
ACTUALLY WITH A SIMILAR VEHICLE,

01:48:54.194 --> 01:48:56.263
AB 881, CARRIED BY

01:48:56.329 --> 01:48:58.565
ASSEMBLYMEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS.

01:48:58.632 --> 01:49:01.368
AND IN A BICAMERAL MANNER. WE'RE

01:49:01.434 --> 01:49:04.271
TRYING TO LAND A FINAL DEAL

01:49:04.337 --> 01:49:06.139
HERE. THE BILL REALLY STEMS FROM

01:49:06.206 --> 01:49:08.842
A LACK OF LEADERSHIP AT THE

01:49:08.909 --> 01:49:10.710
FEDERAL LEVEL, WHERE THEY'VE

01:49:10.777 --> 01:49:13.980
DECIDED TO RESCIND WHAT WERE, WE

01:49:14.047 --> 01:49:15.749
THINK, VERY SOLID SAFETY

01:49:15.815 --> 01:49:17.550
STANDARDS UNDER THE PIPELINE,

01:49:17.617 --> 01:49:19.386
HAZARDOUS HAZARDOUS SAFETY

01:49:19.452 --> 01:49:20.687
MANAGEMENT ADMINISTRATION THAT

01:49:20.754 --> 01:49:22.722
WERE RESCINDED BACK IN JANUARY

01:49:22.789 --> 01:49:26.493
OF 2025. AND SO THE STATE REALLY

01:49:26.559 --> 01:49:28.461
HAS TO FILL THE GAP TO ENSURE

01:49:28.528 --> 01:49:30.430
THAT CARBON DIOXIDE PIPELINES

01:49:30.497 --> 01:49:32.699
TRANSPORTING SUPER CONCENTRATED

01:49:32.766 --> 01:49:34.768
CO2 AT AN INTERSTATE LEVEL ARE

01:49:34.834 --> 01:49:37.237
SUBJECT TO THE STRONGEST SAFETY

01:49:37.304 --> 01:49:39.039
STANDARDS, NOT JUST IN THE STATE

01:49:39.105 --> 01:49:41.308
OR THE COUNTRY, BUT IN THE

01:49:41.374 --> 01:49:43.510
WORLD. THAT'S HOW WE DO IT HERE

01:49:43.576 --> 01:49:44.844
IN CALIFORNIA. WE KNOW THAT THIS

01:49:44.911 --> 01:49:45.979
SECTOR IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL

01:49:46.046 --> 01:49:47.781
TO MEETING OUR CLIMATE GOALS.

01:49:47.847 --> 01:49:49.616
AND SO WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE

01:49:49.683 --> 01:49:51.051
BEFORE YOU TODAY IS SOME

01:49:51.117 --> 01:49:52.252
DIRECTION TO THE STATE FIRE

01:49:52.319 --> 01:49:54.354
MARSHAL TO BUILD UPON THE DRAFT

01:49:54.421 --> 01:49:55.322
FEDERAL GUIDELINES. SO WE DON'T

01:49:55.388 --> 01:49:58.158
DITCH THE WORK DONE BY THE BIDEN

01:49:58.224 --> 01:49:58.725
ADMINISTRATION ENTIRELY. BUT

01:49:58.792 --> 01:50:00.760
THAT THAT BUILDS ON IT. THAT

01:50:00.827 --> 01:50:03.563
ADDS A LITTLE MORE DETAIL. SO WE

01:50:03.630 --> 01:50:04.798
WANT THE FIRE MARSHAL HERE TO

01:50:04.864 --> 01:50:06.299
RETAIN SOME DISCRETIONARY

01:50:06.366 --> 01:50:07.634
ABILITY TO DECIDE WHETHER A

01:50:07.701 --> 01:50:08.702
PROJECT APPLICANT IS MEETING

01:50:08.768 --> 01:50:11.571
THOSE STANDARDS AND THE ABILITY

01:50:11.638 --> 01:50:13.406
TO ALSO ADOPT ADDITIONAL SAFETY

01:50:13.473 --> 01:50:15.675
STANDARDS. BUT IN THE

01:50:15.742 --> 01:50:17.344
DISCUSSIONS AROUND THIS VEHICLE,

01:50:17.410 --> 01:50:18.878
AS WELL AS AB 881, WHICH IS

01:50:18.945 --> 01:50:20.981
GOING TO BE BEFORE THE SENATE

01:50:21.047 --> 01:50:21.815
ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEE

01:50:21.881 --> 01:50:23.883
THIS WEEK, WE'VE BEEN WORKING

01:50:23.950 --> 01:50:25.185
WITH THOSE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:50:25.251 --> 01:50:26.820
BILL AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:50:26.886 --> 01:50:27.687
JUSTICE COMMUNITY, ABOUT

01:50:27.754 --> 01:50:29.589
ENHANCED PROTECTIONS WITHIN A

01:50:29.656 --> 01:50:30.924
PLANNING ZONE AREA FOR HEALTH

01:50:30.991 --> 01:50:33.093
PROTECTION. SO A TWO MILE

01:50:33.159 --> 01:50:35.228
PLANNING ZONE AND REQUIREMENT

01:50:35.295 --> 01:50:36.796
FOR MORE GRANULAR INFORMATION

01:50:36.863 --> 01:50:38.932
AROUND POTENTIAL EXPOSURE FOR

01:50:38.999 --> 01:50:41.468
ANYONE WITHIN A FOUR MILE RANGE

01:50:41.534 --> 01:50:43.603
TO THE LEAD SEQUA AGENCY. THE

01:50:43.670 --> 01:50:45.372
OTHER ITEM IN DISCUSSION THAT I

01:50:45.438 --> 01:50:47.907
WANT TO FLAG FOR YOU ALL IS A

01:50:47.974 --> 01:50:48.575
CARBON DIOXIDE CONCENTRATION

01:50:48.641 --> 01:50:50.043
ASSESSMENT, SO THAT THE MOST

01:50:50.110 --> 01:50:51.511
ENHANCED MODELING WOULD BE USED

01:50:51.578 --> 01:50:54.047
HERE TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS NO

01:50:54.114 --> 01:50:55.815
RISK TO THOSE IN SENSITIVE

01:50:55.882 --> 01:50:57.617
RECEPTOR SITES. SO THOSE ARE

01:50:57.684 --> 01:50:59.786
SOME OF THE ITEMS THAT ARE STILL

01:50:59.853 --> 01:51:02.756
OUTSTANDING. BUT I WANT TO

01:51:02.822 --> 01:51:04.624
ASSURE YOU AND YOU, MR. CHAIR,

AND THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE

01:51:05.759 --> 01:51:07.127
THAT WILL BE CONTINUING TO

01:51:07.193 --> 01:51:09.262
ENGAGE IN GOOD FAITH. AND SHOULD

01:51:09.329 --> 01:51:11.731
THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD TODAY,

01:51:11.798 --> 01:51:13.466
AIMING TO ALIGN WITH WHATEVER

01:51:13.533 --> 01:51:14.501
THOSE ENHANCED PROTECTIONS ARE

01:51:14.567 --> 01:51:17.103
THAT ARE ADOPTED ON THE SENATE

01:51:17.170 --> 01:51:20.774
SIDE. SO HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:22.342
MORE QUESTIONS HERE AND

01:51:22.409 --> 01:51:23.543
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE

01:51:23.610 --> 01:51:26.146
VOTE. I'LL TURN IT OVER TO LEAD

01:51:26.212 --> 01:51:26.780
WITNESS TWO MINUTES, SIR. MR.

01:51:26.846 --> 01:51:27.547
CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS, SCOTT, ON

01:51:27.614 --> 01:51:28.848
BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE

01:51:28.915 --> 01:51:32.252
PIPE TRADES COUNCIL AND THE

01:51:32.318 --> 01:51:34.821
CALIFORNIA CARBON SOLUTIONS C 

01:51:34.888 --> 01:51:36.589
CARBON CAPTURE SOLUTIONS

01:51:36.656 --> 01:51:38.358
COALITION, I WAS VERY INVOLVED

01:51:38.425 --> 01:51:40.794
IN BUDGET TRAILER BILL SB 905 BY

01:51:40.860 --> 01:51:44.397
SENATOR CAVALLARO IN 2022, WHICH

01:51:44.464 --> 01:51:46.499
BASICALLY SET UP THE PERMITTING,

01:51:46.566 --> 01:51:48.835
UNIFORM, PERMITTING AND

01:51:48.902 --> 01:51:50.637
REGULATORY SORT OF FRAMEWORK AT

01:51:50.703 --> 01:51:54.507
AT CARB FOR CARBON CAPTURE AND

01:51:54.574 --> 01:51:55.975
SEQUESTRATION. AT THE VERY LAST

01:51:56.042 --> 01:51:57.844
MINUTE, AN AMENDMENT WAS PUT

01:51:57.911 --> 01:51:59.612
INTO THE BILL THAT PUT A

01:51:59.679 --> 01:52:00.947
MORATORIUM ON PIPELINES UNTIL

01:52:01.014 --> 01:52:03.149
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UNDER

01:52:03.216 --> 01:52:04.284
PHMSA COULD ADOPT THOSE

01:52:04.350 --> 01:52:06.486
REGULATIONS. WE ARE OKAY WITH

01:52:06.553 --> 01:52:07.921
THAT. WE DID, HOWEVER, HAVE A

01:52:07.987 --> 01:52:10.890
LITTLE HESITATION THAT THERE'S

01:52:10.957 --> 01:52:13.593
ALWAYS PROBLEMS THAT ARISE. SO

01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:14.694
ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE WAS ADDED

01:52:14.761 --> 01:52:15.762
THAT DIRECTED THE STATE FIRE

01:52:15.829 --> 01:52:18.031
MARSHAL TO DO A REPORT TO THIS

01:52:18.098 --> 01:52:21.601
LEGISLATURE BY FEBRUARY 30TH OF

01:52:21.668 --> 01:52:24.070
2023, WHICH THEY DID, WHICH SAID

01:52:24.137 --> 01:52:26.106
THAT THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL WAS

01:52:26.172 --> 01:52:28.675
PREPARED AND CAPABLE OF ISSUING

01:52:28.741 --> 01:52:30.543
SAFETY GUIDELINES AS WELL. THE

01:52:30.610 --> 01:52:33.780
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION GOT THE

01:52:33.847 --> 01:52:35.215
REGULATIONS SORT OF TO THIRD

01:52:35.281 --> 01:52:36.716
BASE. AND THEN WITH THE LAST

01:52:36.783 --> 01:52:38.084
ELECTION, THERE'S BEEN A FREEZE

01:52:38.151 --> 01:52:40.320
ON FINAL ADOPTIONS OF ALL

01:52:40.386 --> 01:52:41.287
REGULATIONS BY THE BIDEN

01:52:41.354 --> 01:52:43.890
ADMINISTRATION. WITHOUT GETTING

01:52:43.957 --> 01:52:46.326
THIS PIPELINE ISSUE RESOLVED,

01:52:46.392 --> 01:52:48.862
THE SUNSET DATE, BOTH ON FEDERAL

01:52:48.928 --> 01:52:51.731
MONIES THAT ARE STILL AVAILABLE

01:52:51.798 --> 01:52:53.233
FOR CARBON CAPTURE AND

01:52:53.299 --> 01:52:54.467
SEQUESTRATION, AS WELL AS THE

01:52:54.534 --> 01:52:57.103
TEN YEAR SUNSET DATE ON SB 905,

01:52:57.170 --> 01:53:00.039
IS GOING TO RUN. THE SCOPING

01:53:00.106 --> 01:53:03.710
PLAN IS LOOKING TO 1 MILLION

01:53:03.776 --> 01:53:05.645
METRIC TONS OF CARBON TO MEET

01:53:05.712 --> 01:53:07.380
OUR CARBON GOALS, PROBABLY MORE

01:53:07.447 --> 01:53:08.848
NOW THAT OFFSHORE WIND IS KIND

01:53:08.915 --> 01:53:11.317
OF BEEN PUT ON THE BACK BURNER.

01:53:11.384 --> 01:53:13.319
SO THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS

01:53:13.386 --> 01:53:15.889
ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL FOR ALL THE

01:53:15.955 --> 01:53:18.825
STATED REASONS ABOVE, IT PUTS

01:53:18.892 --> 01:53:20.560
THE BIDEN STANDARDS IN PLACE,

01:53:20.627 --> 01:53:21.561
BUT THEN EMPOWERS THE FIRE

01:53:21.628 --> 01:53:23.830
MARSHAL TO ENHANCE THOSE WITH

01:53:23.897 --> 01:53:25.965
WITH MORE STRINGENT SAFETY

01:53:26.032 --> 01:53:28.868
GUIDELINES. SO THIS IS A CLASSIC

01:53:28.935 --> 01:53:30.236
EXAMPLE OF NOT LETTING PERFECT

01:53:30.303 --> 01:53:32.205
BE THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD. WE

01:53:32.272 --> 01:53:33.606
HAVE TO DO THIS IN ORDER TO

01:53:33.673 --> 01:53:35.808
FOSTER THIS WHOLE DEVELOPMENT OF

01:53:35.875 --> 01:53:37.377
THIS INDUSTRY AND TO MEET OUR

01:53:37.443 --> 01:53:38.711
CLIMATE GOALS. SO WE WOULD URGE

01:53:38.778 --> 01:53:41.781
AND I VOTE, THANK YOU. THANK YOU

01:53:41.848 --> 01:53:43.650

01:54:09.943 --> 01:54:11.411
AFTERNOON, MARIE LIU, ON BEHALF

01:54:11.477 --> 01:54:13.279

AMENDED POSITION ON HERE, WE

01:54:17.317 --> 01:54:18.685
REMAIN OPPOSED TO THIS BILL AS

01:54:18.751 --> 01:54:20.653
WELL AS IDENTICAL BILL AB 881,

01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:21.854
AS THIS BILL DOES NOT YET

01:54:21.921 --> 01:54:23.189
ADDRESS PROTECTIONS THAT ARE

01:54:23.256 --> 01:54:24.591
CRITICAL TO CONSIDER WHERE

01:54:24.657 --> 01:54:26.059
PIPELINES ARE WHEN PIPELINES ARE

01:54:26.125 --> 01:54:27.894
SITED NEAR PEOPLE, REGARDLESS OF

01:54:27.961 --> 01:54:31.898
YOUR POSITION ON THE ISSUES, THE

01:54:31.965 --> 01:54:33.900
SITING AND SAFETY ISSUES OF

01:54:33.967 --> 01:54:35.868
PIPELINES IS A SEPARATE ISSUE.

01:54:35.935 --> 01:54:37.971
CO2 PIPELINES ARE ARE HAZARDOUS.

01:54:38.037 --> 01:54:40.473
THEY LEAK IN A LEAK. THEY WOULD

01:54:40.540 --> 01:54:42.041
CREATE A DENSE, HEAVY CLOUD OF

01:54:42.108 --> 01:54:44.877
CO2 THAT CAN POSE A FIXATION

01:54:44.944 --> 01:54:48.114
RISK THAT CAN TRAVEL EVEN A MILE

01:54:48.181 --> 01:54:50.483
AWAY FROM THE RUPTURE SITE. AND

01:54:50.550 --> 01:54:51.451
SATARTIA, MISSISSIPPI, WHERE

01:54:51.517 --> 01:54:53.820
THERE WAS A LARGE SPILL IN 2020.

01:54:53.886 --> 01:54:55.288
RESIDENTS LOST CONSCIOUSNESS,

01:54:55.355 --> 01:54:56.589
HAD SEIZURES, AND EMERGENCY

01:54:56.656 --> 01:54:58.224
VEHICLES WOULD NOT OPERATE

01:54:58.291 --> 01:54:59.692
BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH

01:54:59.759 --> 01:55:01.661
OXYGEN IN THE AIR TO RUN THEIR

01:55:01.728 --> 01:55:04.364
INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES.

01:55:04.430 --> 01:55:05.598
THERE ARE THESE ARE NOT

01:55:05.665 --> 01:55:07.433
PIPELINES THAT YOU WANT NEAR A

01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:09.902
SCHOOL NEAR NEAR HOSPITAL. YET

01:55:09.969 --> 01:55:12.171
THIS BILL DOES NOT YET HAVE

01:55:12.238 --> 01:55:13.273
THOSE RESTRICTIONS. WE'VE

01:55:13.339 --> 01:55:14.340
PROVIDED THE AUTHOR WITH

01:55:14.407 --> 01:55:16.075
LANGUAGE THAT WOULD REQUIRE

01:55:16.142 --> 01:55:18.645
ADDITIONAL SAFETY PROVISIONS

01:55:18.711 --> 01:55:20.780
BASED OFF OF SITING. THOSE

01:55:20.847 --> 01:55:22.282
PROVISIONS HAVE NOT YET BEEN

01:55:22.348 --> 01:55:23.683
ACCEPTED. WE APPRECIATE THAT WE

01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:25.785
ARE HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH

UNTIL THOSE ISSUES ARE RESOLVED,

01:55:32.025 --> 01:55:33.760
WE BELIEVE THIS BILL IS NOT YET

01:55:33.826 --> 01:55:35.261
PROTECTIVE ENOUGH OF

01:55:35.328 --> 01:55:36.863

PIPELINES, THE REGS ONLY REQUIRE

01:57:16.863 --> 01:57:19.766
THAT LEAK DETECTION MECHANISMS

01:57:19.832 --> 01:57:21.701

THOSE LEAK DETECTION MECHANISMS

01:57:29.809 --> 01:57:32.278
ARE. IT'S VERY VAGUE. EVEN UNDER

01:57:32.345 --> 01:57:34.347
THE DRAFT FISMA REGULATIONS,

01:57:34.414 --> 01:57:36.516
WHICH ARE INTENDED TO BE MORE

01:57:36.582 --> 01:57:38.718
RESTRICTIVE OR MORE PROTECTIVE

01:57:38.785 --> 01:57:40.653
THAN CARBON DIOXIDE PIPELINES,

01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:45.224
THE SATARTIA MISSISSIPPI SPILL

01:57:45.291 --> 01:57:46.726
SHOWED THAT ACTUALLY THERE NEEDS

01:57:46.793 --> 01:57:48.728
TO BE DIFFERENT. THE CARBON THE

01:57:48.795 --> 01:57:51.297
AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW BETTER THAN

01:57:51.364 --> 01:57:54.167
ME, THE PROPERTIES OF CARBON

01:57:54.233 --> 01:57:56.936
DIOXIDE REQUIRE DIFFERENT

01:57:57.003 --> 01:57:58.938
REGULATIONS AND DIFFERENT SAFETY

01:57:59.005 --> 01:58:01.140

01:58:04.110 --> 01:58:05.411
THAT BECAUSE OF THE BECAUSE OF

01:58:05.478 --> 01:58:07.847
THAT, THERE ARE A LOT OF

01:58:07.914 --> 01:58:11.050
DETECTION, NEW DEVELOPMENTS AND

01:58:11.117 --> 01:58:14.320
IT'S FORTHCOMING. THANK YOU. MR.

01:58:33.172 --> 01:58:34.507
APPRECIATE THAT AND I LIKE I

01:58:34.574 --> 01:58:38.144
LIKE THAT ASSOCIATION. WITHOUT

01:58:38.211 --> 01:58:42.448
THIS BILL, WE DEFAULT TO NO

01:58:42.515 --> 01:58:44.951
REGULATION. WE DEFAULT TO WHAT

01:58:45.017 --> 01:58:46.419
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS

01:58:46.486 --> 01:58:48.588
PROPOSED, WHICH IS A TOTAL

01:58:48.654 --> 01:58:50.790
RESCISSION. AND I THINK THAT I

01:58:50.857 --> 01:58:51.824
HOPE THE OPPOSITION WOULD AGREE

01:58:51.891 --> 01:58:55.361
WITH ME THAT IT'S NOT SO MUCH

01:58:55.428 --> 01:58:56.696
THE BILL DOESN'T ALLOW THE STATE

01:58:56.762 --> 01:58:58.431
FIRE MARSHAL TO ADOPT THOSE SORT

01:58:58.498 --> 01:58:59.732
OF HEALTH PROTECTION ZONES OR

01:58:59.799 --> 01:59:03.569
THOSE THOSE SORT OF SETBACKS.

01:59:03.636 --> 01:59:05.204
IT'S THAT IT DOESN'T SPECIFY

01:59:05.271 --> 01:59:06.572
EXACTLY THE NUMBER IN IT RIGHT

01:59:06.639 --> 01:59:09.275
NOW. SO IT DOESN'T PRECLUDE, AS

01:59:09.342 --> 01:59:11.210
I MENTIONED AT THE OUTSET, THAT

01:59:11.277 --> 01:59:12.678
TWO MILE PLANNING ZONE OR EVEN A

01:59:12.745 --> 01:59:14.647
FOUR MILE RANGE ON LEAK

01:59:14.714 --> 01:59:15.515
DETECTION OR ENHANCED MODELING

01:59:15.581 --> 01:59:18.050
DOESN'T PRECLUDE ANY OF THAT.

01:59:18.117 --> 01:59:19.819
BUT I THINK WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING

01:59:19.886 --> 01:59:21.921
FOR AND I APPRECIATE IT IS, IS

01:59:21.988 --> 01:59:24.357
REAL SPECIFICITY. WE WERE

01:59:24.423 --> 01:59:25.358
THINKING THAT IT MADE SENSE FOR

01:59:25.424 --> 01:59:27.426
THE FIRE MARSHAL TO GO THROUGH

01:59:27.493 --> 01:59:28.895
THAT PUBLIC PROCESS AND GET THAT

01:59:28.961 --> 01:59:30.229
FEEDBACK AND SORT OF USE THE

01:59:30.296 --> 01:59:31.697
EVIDENTIARY PROCESS TO REALLY

01:59:31.764 --> 01:59:33.566
DRILL DOWN, IF YOU WILL, ON

01:59:33.633 --> 01:59:34.667
EXACTLY WHAT THAT NUMBER OUGHT

01:59:34.734 --> 01:59:36.802
TO BE. SO RIGHT NOW, IT'S A

01:59:36.869 --> 01:59:38.704
DISCRETION IN STATUTE VERSUS DO

01:59:38.771 --> 01:59:41.107
YOU PICK A NUMBER IN STATUTE

01:59:41.173 --> 01:59:43.276
DISAGREEMENT? I HOPE I'M

01:59:43.342 --> 01:59:44.377
CHARACTERIZING THAT RIGHT. I'D

01:59:44.443 --> 01:59:45.511
DEFER TO THE OPPOSITION. BUT I

01:59:45.578 --> 01:59:47.513
THINK I THINK THAT'S REALLY THE

01:59:47.580 --> 01:59:50.383
TENSION POINT RIGHT NOW. I THINK

01:59:50.449 --> 01:59:52.852
THE THERE'S I THINK SOME

01:59:52.919 --> 01:59:54.086
CONSENSUS THAT THE STATE DOES

01:59:54.153 --> 01:59:56.289
NEED TO STEP UP AND ADOPT SAFETY

01:59:56.355 --> 01:59:57.356
STANDARDS, EXACTLY WHAT THOSE

01:59:57.423 --> 02:00:00.059
ARE. AND DO WE DO THAT IN

02:00:00.126 --> 02:00:02.929
STATUTE OR BY REG IS THE DISPUTE

02:00:02.995 --> 02:00:09.168
AND IS PART OF YOUR. REASON FOR

02:00:09.235 --> 02:00:12.038
CARRYING THIS BILL THAT THE IPCC

02:00:12.104 --> 02:00:14.206
IS RECOGNIZING THAT WE DO NEED

02:00:14.273 --> 02:00:15.341
TO HAVE CARBON CAPTURE AND

02:00:15.408 --> 02:00:16.776
STORAGE IN ORDER TO REACH OUR

02:00:16.842 --> 02:00:19.211
GOALS OF CARBON NEUTRALITY.

02:00:19.278 --> 02:00:20.513
YEAH, I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S

02:00:20.580 --> 02:00:23.616
A ROLE, AND I'M NOT SAYING FOR

02:00:23.683 --> 02:00:24.951
THINGS LIKE ENHANCED OIL

02:00:25.017 --> 02:00:26.852
RECOVERY, BUT WHEN IT COMES TO

02:00:26.919 --> 02:00:28.955
CEMENT PRODUCTION, IF WE DON'T

02:00:29.021 --> 02:00:31.524
HAVE A WAY FOR A PIPE TO CARRY

02:00:31.591 --> 02:00:34.760
THAT CAPTURED CO2 SOMEWHERE,

02:00:34.827 --> 02:00:37.029
CEMENT INDUSTRY IS GOING TO JUST

02:00:37.096 --> 02:00:38.230
KEEP POLLUTING LIKE THEY ALWAYS

02:00:38.297 --> 02:00:40.566
DO. SO I ACTUALLY THINK WHEN IT

02:00:40.633 --> 02:00:41.367
COMES TO THINGS LIKE CARBON

02:00:41.434 --> 02:00:43.669
REMOVAL AND, YOU KNOW, AREAS

02:00:43.736 --> 02:00:45.838
THAT WE NEED TO MAKE IMMEDIATE

02:00:45.905 --> 02:00:47.540
PROGRESS ON, WE'VE GOT TO GET

02:00:47.607 --> 02:00:48.641
SOME SAFETY STANDARDS IN PLACE.

02:00:48.708 --> 02:00:51.277
AND I ALSO THINK WE COULD DRIVE

02:00:51.344 --> 02:00:51.844
SAFETY STANDARDS ACROSS THE

02:00:51.911 --> 02:00:52.645
COUNTRY, TOO, BECAUSE THIS IS

02:00:52.712 --> 02:00:53.779
HAPPENING ELSEWHERE. IT'S NOT

02:00:53.846 --> 02:00:55.648
HAPPENING HERE. BUT IF WE WERE

02:00:55.715 --> 02:00:56.983
ABLE TO DRIVE THE INDUSTRY AND

02:00:57.049 --> 02:00:59.652
SAY, YOU KNOW, DOING ENHANCED

02:00:59.719 --> 02:01:02.221
FLUID DYNAMIC MODELING, WE WILL

02:01:02.288 --> 02:01:04.290
KNOW THEN HOW YOU DESCRIBE THAT

02:01:04.357 --> 02:01:05.524
KIND OF MODELING. BUT IF WE WERE

02:01:05.591 --> 02:01:07.460
TO DEPLOY THAT KIND OF

02:01:07.526 --> 02:01:08.060
TECHNOLOGY HERE FIRST, THAT

02:01:08.127 --> 02:01:09.428
SCALES, YOU KNOW, THESE ARE THE

02:01:09.495 --> 02:01:10.463
KINDS OF THINGS THAT I THINK

02:01:10.529 --> 02:01:12.465
IT'S A GOOD THING. IT'S AN

02:01:12.531 --> 02:01:14.166
AWKWARD PLACE TO LEAN IN,

02:01:14.233 --> 02:01:14.967
BECAUSE THIS IS NOT EVERYONE'S

02:01:15.034 --> 02:01:16.235
FAVORITE CLIMATE MITIGATION

02:01:16.302 --> 02:01:16.869
STRATEGY. BUT I ACTUALLY THINK

02:01:16.936 --> 02:01:18.270
THIS IS ONE WHERE WE'VE GOT TO

02:01:18.337 --> 02:01:20.439
SORT OF BE BRAVE AND STEP IN AND

02:01:20.506 --> 02:01:22.942
OWN THE SPACE. SO THAT'S WHY YOU

02:01:23.009 --> 02:01:26.178
FIND ME ON THIS IN THIS AWKWARD

02:01:26.245 --> 02:01:30.916
SPOT. SO, MISS LOU. YOU KNOW, IF

02:01:30.983 --> 02:01:32.184
WE'RE GOING TO DO IT, SHOULDN'T

02:01:32.251 --> 02:01:34.587
WE HAVE SAFETY STANDARDS RATHER

02:01:34.654 --> 02:01:36.622
THAN NO STANDARDS? YEAH, I THINK

02:01:36.689 --> 02:01:38.024
ACTUALLY OUR ORGANIZATIONS

02:01:38.090 --> 02:01:39.625
DEFINITELY AGREE THAT WE WOULD

02:01:39.692 --> 02:01:42.128
LIKE THERE TO BE STATE, YOU

02:01:42.194 --> 02:01:44.630
KNOW, STATE REGULATIONS IN

02:01:44.697 --> 02:01:45.898
ESPECIALLY WITH THE LACK OF

02:01:45.965 --> 02:01:47.333
FEDERAL ACTION HERE. BUT THIS IS

02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:50.670
OUR OUR OPPORTUNITY HERE IS THAT

02:01:50.736 --> 02:01:52.505
WE ARE LOOKING AT A LARGE NUMBER

02:01:52.571 --> 02:01:54.306
OF PIPELINES BEING BUILT IN

02:01:54.373 --> 02:01:56.042
CALIFORNIA IN ORDER TO MEET OUR

02:01:56.108 --> 02:01:58.611
CLIMATE GOALS. THESE ARE VERY,

02:01:58.678 --> 02:02:00.813
VERY DIFFICULT PIPELINES TO

02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:02.915
RETROFIT TO MEET SAFETY

02:02:02.982 --> 02:02:04.417
STANDARDS. SO WE'RE IN THE

02:02:04.483 --> 02:02:05.885
POSITION WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY

02:02:05.951 --> 02:02:07.386
SET IT RIGHT. AND SO THAT'S WHAT

02:02:07.453 --> 02:02:09.822
THE WHERE WE CAN WE CAN START

02:02:09.889 --> 02:02:12.625
WITH STRONG REGULATIONS AS

02:02:12.692 --> 02:02:13.726
ESPECIALLY AS WE FIGURE THIS

02:02:13.793 --> 02:02:14.860
OUT. THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S

02:02:14.927 --> 02:02:16.696
OFFICE HAS HAS NEVER REGULATED

02:02:16.762 --> 02:02:20.332
CO2 PIPE LINES SEPARATELY. THEY

02:02:20.399 --> 02:02:21.701
HAVE BEEN TREATED IN THE PAST

02:02:21.767 --> 02:02:23.235
THE SAME AS HAZARDOUS OTHER

02:02:23.302 --> 02:02:25.037
HAZARDOUS LIQUIDS, WHICH WE HAVE

02:02:25.104 --> 02:02:26.539
DISCOVERED HAS BEEN

02:02:26.605 --> 02:02:28.074
INSUFFICIENT. THIS IS NEW. THIS

02:02:28.140 --> 02:02:30.543
IS NEW REGULATORY TERRITORY. SO

02:02:30.609 --> 02:02:32.511
THE DESIRE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:02:32.578 --> 02:02:34.580
WE START OFF IN A PLACE THAT WE

02:02:34.647 --> 02:02:35.848
ARE PARTICULARLY PROTECTIVE OF

02:02:35.915 --> 02:02:37.483
PEOPLE. AS WE FIGURE THESE

02:02:37.550 --> 02:02:39.752
THINGS OUT, WE WILL HAVE A

02:02:39.819 --> 02:02:40.753
BETTER UNDERSTANDING AS WE BUILD

02:02:40.820 --> 02:02:44.156
MORE CARBON PIPELINES OF WHAT

02:02:44.223 --> 02:02:48.227
ARE THE MOST CRITICAL POINTS IN

02:02:48.294 --> 02:02:50.996
THE SAFETY STANDARDS, AND WE CAN

02:02:51.063 --> 02:02:51.564
MAKE ADJUSTMENTS. BUT IT'S

02:02:51.630 --> 02:02:53.933
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE FOR THE

02:02:53.999 --> 02:02:55.768
COMMUNITIES WHO ARE GOING TO BE

02:02:55.835 --> 02:02:57.002
IMPACTED BY THESE PIPELINES,

02:02:57.069 --> 02:02:58.370
THAT WE START WITH SOMETHING

02:02:58.437 --> 02:03:00.840
VERY, VERY STRONG. AND SO WHILE

02:03:00.906 --> 02:03:03.476
WE APPRECIATE THE DESIRE FOR THE

02:03:03.542 --> 02:03:05.878
STATE TO DEVELOP REGULATIONS, WE

02:03:05.945 --> 02:03:07.313
CAN'T JUST LEAVE IT TO STATE

02:03:07.379 --> 02:03:08.581
FIRE MARSHAL'S OFFICE AND ASSUME

02:03:08.647 --> 02:03:10.483
THAT THEY'LL DO A GOOD JOB WHEN

02:03:10.549 --> 02:03:12.184
IT COMES TO OIL AND GAS. YOU

02:03:12.251 --> 02:03:14.019
KNOW, THIS IS A DIFFERENT ISSUE

02:03:14.086 --> 02:03:15.454
AREA, BUT THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL

02:03:15.521 --> 02:03:16.655
HAS NOT NECESSARILY BEEN THE

02:03:16.722 --> 02:03:19.158
MOST PROTECTIVE. AND SO THAT'S

02:03:19.225 --> 02:03:20.226
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IN

02:03:20.292 --> 02:03:22.795
THIS BILL, IS TO HAVE ENOUGH

02:03:22.862 --> 02:03:24.096
SPECIFICITY IN HOW THE STATE

02:03:24.163 --> 02:03:26.832
FIRE MARSHAL INTRODUCES ITS

02:03:26.899 --> 02:03:28.501
FIRST REGULATIONS TO MAKE SURE

02:03:28.567 --> 02:03:30.402
THAT THEY ARE AS PROTECTIVE AS

02:03:30.469 --> 02:03:32.204
THEY CAN BE FOR THE COMMUNITIES

02:03:32.271 --> 02:03:34.006
WHO WILL HAVE THESE PIPELINES

02:03:34.073 --> 02:03:35.975
RUNNING NEARBY. BUT ISN'T THIS

02:03:36.041 --> 02:03:37.376
CODIFYING THE BIDEN

02:03:37.443 --> 02:03:39.311
ADMINISTRATION'S REGULATIONS?

02:03:39.378 --> 02:03:41.781
THEY. THAT IS THE STARTING

02:03:41.847 --> 02:03:44.784
POINT. WHILE THAT WAS A GOOD

02:03:44.850 --> 02:03:47.219
STARTING POINT, THERE ARE THINGS

02:03:47.286 --> 02:03:49.255
THAT ARE UNSPECIFIED IN THOSE

02:03:49.321 --> 02:03:50.790
REGULATIONS THAT WE BELIEVE NEED

02:03:50.856 --> 02:03:53.959
TO BE SPECIFIED. SPECIFICALLY,

02:03:54.026 --> 02:03:56.929
FISMA IS PROHIBITED BY CONGRESS

02:03:56.996 --> 02:03:58.464
TO GET INTO SITING ISSUES. THEY

02:03:58.531 --> 02:04:00.533
DON'T HAVE JURISDICTION HERE. WE

02:04:00.599 --> 02:04:03.302
IN CALIFORNIA ARE NOT RESTRICTED

02:04:03.369 --> 02:04:05.905
TO THOSE SAME TO THOSE SAME

02:04:05.971 --> 02:04:07.006
JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES. WE CAN

02:04:07.072 --> 02:04:09.008
HAVE THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL GET

02:04:09.074 --> 02:04:10.109
INVOLVED IN SITING ISSUES, AND

02:04:10.176 --> 02:04:11.977
WE BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD,

02:04:12.044 --> 02:04:14.146
BECAUSE OTHERWISE, YOU KNOW, I,

02:04:14.213 --> 02:04:15.714
I WOULD LIKE TO FIRMLY BELIEVE

02:04:15.781 --> 02:04:18.083
THAT THESE THESE COMPANIES DON'T

02:04:18.150 --> 02:04:20.719
WANT TO LOOK FOR PIPELINES.

02:04:20.786 --> 02:04:21.787
DON'T AREN'T DON'T AREN'T THEY

02:04:21.854 --> 02:04:23.556
ARE NOT LOOKING TO SITE A

02:04:23.622 --> 02:04:25.758
PIPELINE UNDER A DAYCARE OR A

02:04:25.825 --> 02:04:27.860
SCHOOL OR ANYWHERE NEAR I ASSUME

02:04:27.927 --> 02:04:30.796
THAT'S THE CASE. SO LET'S HAVE

02:04:30.863 --> 02:04:34.266
STANDARDS HERE TO JUST BE

02:04:34.333 --> 02:04:35.334
ASSURED THAT THAT'S THAT'S GOING

02:04:35.401 --> 02:04:37.736
TO BE THE SITUATION, IF I MIGHT,

02:04:37.803 --> 02:04:40.372
MR. I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR MY

02:04:40.439 --> 02:04:42.775
COLLEAGUE, BUT THIS IS A BIT OF

02:04:42.842 --> 02:04:44.109
OBFUSCATION HERE. FIRST OF ALL,

02:04:44.176 --> 02:04:45.578
IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS, THERE'S

02:04:45.644 --> 02:04:47.479
NOT GOING TO BE A SLEW OF

02:04:47.546 --> 02:04:49.949
PIPELINES THAT ARE GOING TO BE

02:04:50.015 --> 02:04:51.717
SITED THAT ARE GOING TO BE

02:04:51.784 --> 02:04:52.852
PERMITTED, THAT ARE GOING TO GO

02:04:52.918 --> 02:04:53.953
THROUGH SEQUA AND BE READY TO

02:04:54.019 --> 02:04:55.454
GO. THERE'S GOING TO BE MORE

02:04:55.521 --> 02:04:56.956
THAN AMPLE TIME FOR THE STATE

02:04:57.022 --> 02:04:59.925
FIRE MARSHAL TO ADOPT ADDITIONAL

02:04:59.992 --> 02:05:01.327
STANDARDS IN ADDITION TO THE

02:05:01.393 --> 02:05:02.862
BIDEN STANDARDS. WHILE ALL OF

02:05:02.928 --> 02:05:04.997
THE AFOREMENTIONED PROCESSES ARE

02:05:05.064 --> 02:05:06.432
GOING FORWARD. OKAY, IT'S NOT

02:05:06.498 --> 02:05:08.300
LIKE TOMORROW THIS BILL PASSES

02:05:08.367 --> 02:05:09.501
AND MY MEMBERS ARE GOING TO BE

02:05:09.568 --> 02:05:11.103
OUT DIGGING DITCHES AND LAYING

02:05:11.170 --> 02:05:13.606
PIPE. OKAY, THAT'S 3 OR 4 YEARS,

02:05:13.672 --> 02:05:15.474
BUT THESE PROJECTS ARE

02:05:15.541 --> 02:05:16.976
ECONOMICALLY VERY INTENSE. THEY

02:05:17.042 --> 02:05:18.544
TAKE A LOT OF INVESTMENT, THEY

02:05:18.611 --> 02:05:20.512
TAKE A HUGE AMOUNT OF PLANNING.

02:05:20.579 --> 02:05:23.716
AND SO THIS ALLOWS THAT TO GO

02:05:23.782 --> 02:05:24.483
SIMULTANEOUSLY. WHILE WE AWAIT

02:05:24.550 --> 02:05:26.318
THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL TO ADD

02:05:26.385 --> 02:05:28.387
THESE THINGS. AND FRANKLY, GIVEN

02:05:28.454 --> 02:05:30.155
THE TECHNICAL ASPECT OF WHAT

02:05:30.222 --> 02:05:31.490
WE'RE DISCUSSING HERE, WE THINK

02:05:31.557 --> 02:05:34.493
THAT THE REGULATORY PROCESS IS

02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:36.495
GOING TO BE IS GOING TO BE THE

02:05:36.562 --> 02:05:38.364
APPROPRIATE VENUE TO HAVE A

02:05:38.430 --> 02:05:41.700
ROBUST SORT OF INVESTIGATION AND

02:05:41.767 --> 02:05:42.735
WEIGHING OF ALL THESE. AND THEN

02:05:42.801 --> 02:05:45.971
I FINALLY I JUST MENTIONED THAT

02:05:46.038 --> 02:05:46.605
THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION

02:05:46.672 --> 02:05:48.540
INITIATED THIS, THIS WHOLE

02:05:48.607 --> 02:05:50.309
PROCESS AS A RESULT OF

02:05:50.376 --> 02:05:51.777
MISSISSIPPI. OKAY. AND I DON'T

02:05:51.844 --> 02:05:53.545
THINK ANYBODY'S GOING TO ACCUSE

02:05:53.612 --> 02:05:54.346
THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION OF

02:05:54.413 --> 02:05:56.782
BEING TOO COZY WITH WITH THE,

02:05:56.849 --> 02:05:58.417
YOU KNOW, WITH THE OIL AND GAS

02:05:58.484 --> 02:05:59.685
INDUSTRY OR THE CARBON INDUSTRY.

02:05:59.752 --> 02:06:01.553
THERE WAS A VERY ROBUST PROCESS

02:06:01.620 --> 02:06:03.455
AT PHMSA. WE PARTICIPATED IN IT,

02:06:03.522 --> 02:06:04.723
AND THERE WILL BE A ROBUST

02:06:04.790 --> 02:06:06.592
PROCESS AT THE STATE FIRE

02:06:06.659 --> 02:06:08.127
MARSHAL. BUT AGAIN, THIS IS NOT

02:06:08.193 --> 02:06:09.428
GOING TO HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. THESE

02:06:09.495 --> 02:06:11.764
TAKE LONG TERM PLANNING. SO

02:06:11.830 --> 02:06:14.166
LET'S TURN TO THAT POINT. I'M

02:06:14.233 --> 02:06:16.268
NOT AWARE OF A CEQA EXEMPTION

02:06:16.335 --> 02:06:17.803
FOR CARBON DIOXIDE PIPELINES.

02:06:17.870 --> 02:06:21.040
NO, SIR. THANK YOU. NO CHEESE,

02:06:21.106 --> 02:06:24.543
NO CHEESE. CHEESE, CHEESE. ANY

02:06:24.610 --> 02:06:25.544
OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM

02:06:25.611 --> 02:06:29.915
COMMITTEE, MR. BURR? I THINK.

02:06:29.982 --> 02:06:32.484
FOLLOWING ON ON COMMENTS, MY

02:06:32.551 --> 02:06:34.320
COLLEAGUE FROM TORRANCE

02:06:34.386 --> 02:06:36.288
MENTIONED I WAS LOOKING AT THE

02:06:36.355 --> 02:06:41.193
ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY. LETTER

02:06:41.260 --> 02:06:42.895
AND THEY MADE A COUPLE POINTS.

02:06:42.962 --> 02:06:45.264
ONE IS THAT CARBON DIOXIDE

02:06:45.331 --> 02:06:47.132
PIPELINES ARE DANGEROUS AND

02:06:47.199 --> 02:06:50.269
UNDER-REGULATED. SO THE

02:06:50.336 --> 02:06:51.537
REGULATIONS THAT WOULD COME OUT

02:06:51.603 --> 02:06:53.439
OF THIS PROCESS, WOULD THEY

02:06:53.505 --> 02:06:58.444
APPLY TO BOTH NEW AND EXISTING

02:06:58.510 --> 02:07:00.379
PIPELINES? YES. THERE AREN'T

02:07:00.446 --> 02:07:01.547
THERE AREN'T ANY EXISTING. ARE

02:07:01.613 --> 02:07:03.382
THERE ANY EXISTING PIPELINES OF

02:07:03.449 --> 02:07:04.750
SUPERCRITICAL CO2 TRANSPORT IN

02:07:04.817 --> 02:07:05.651
CALIFORNIA? TO MY KNOWLEDGE,

02:07:05.718 --> 02:07:09.088
I'LL TURN TO MR. BUT HE'S THE

02:07:09.154 --> 02:07:10.322
SENATOR IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.

02:07:10.389 --> 02:07:11.590
THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY

02:07:11.657 --> 02:07:13.025
OPPORTUNITIES TO TAKE EXISTING

02:07:13.092 --> 02:07:14.860
PIPELINE NATURAL GAS PIPELINES

02:07:14.927 --> 02:07:16.595
AND POTENTIALLY CONVERT THEM

02:07:16.662 --> 02:07:18.664
INTO CARBON, BUT THEY WOULD HAVE

02:07:18.731 --> 02:07:20.499
TO BE GO THROUGH JUST LIKE A NEW

02:07:20.566 --> 02:07:22.568
PIPELINE. THEY'D HAVE TO GO

02:07:22.634 --> 02:07:23.535
THROUGH A ALL THROUGH THE

02:07:23.602 --> 02:07:24.370
PERMITTING REVIEW, ENVIRONMENTAL

02:07:24.436 --> 02:07:27.139
REVIEW TO DO THAT. AND IN THE

02:07:27.206 --> 02:07:28.974
REGULATIONS WOULD ADDRESS THAT.

02:07:29.041 --> 02:07:30.342
BUT AS THEY'RE GOING THROUGH

02:07:30.409 --> 02:07:32.878
CEQA, THEN, I MEAN, THE DOWNSIDE

02:07:32.945 --> 02:07:35.814
OF NOT HAVING SO THE

02:07:35.881 --> 02:07:36.915
RECOMMENDATION THAT THE

02:07:36.982 --> 02:07:38.684
ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS HAD WAS THE

02:07:38.751 --> 02:07:39.852
BEST COURSE OF ACTION WAS TO

02:07:39.918 --> 02:07:42.454
LEAVE SB 905, THE MORATORIUM IN

02:07:42.521 --> 02:07:43.856
PLACE, AND FOR CALIFORNIA TO

02:07:43.922 --> 02:07:44.857
ISSUE GUIDELINES AFTER THE

02:07:44.923 --> 02:07:46.925
FEDERAL RULE IS COMPLETE. NOW,

02:07:46.992 --> 02:07:48.394
WHERE IS THE FEDERAL RULE? IS

02:07:48.460 --> 02:07:50.062
THAT EVER GOING TO BE COMPLETE?

02:07:50.129 --> 02:07:53.165
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, JUST

02:07:53.232 --> 02:07:55.200
WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THESE

02:07:55.267 --> 02:07:57.436
REGULATIONS, JUST HAS ADOPTED A

02:07:57.503 --> 02:07:58.871
MORATORIUM ON ALL REGULATION. HE

02:07:58.937 --> 02:08:00.672
DID IT IN EXECUTIVE ORDER, LIKE

02:08:00.739 --> 02:08:02.474
HIS FIRST WEEK IN OFFICE ON ALL

02:08:02.541 --> 02:08:04.309
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION RULES. SO

02:08:04.376 --> 02:08:05.944
THEY'RE JUST THEY'RE FROZEN AND

02:08:06.011 --> 02:08:08.247
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE

02:08:08.313 --> 02:08:12.151
RESURRECTED. SO THE THINGS THAT

02:08:12.217 --> 02:08:13.585
PROTECT THE PUBLIC WOULD BE

02:08:13.652 --> 02:08:14.586
SEQUA AND WE DON'T HAVE AN

02:08:14.653 --> 02:08:17.089
EXEMPTION FOR THAT. SO THAT'S

02:08:17.156 --> 02:08:21.126
GOOD. IT SEEMS TO ME. AND, YOU

02:08:21.193 --> 02:08:22.661
KNOW, SETTING ASIDE THE

02:08:22.728 --> 02:08:23.962
ARGUMENTS THAT, THAT THE

02:08:24.029 --> 02:08:25.297
OPPONENTS ARE MAKING, WHICH, YOU

02:08:25.364 --> 02:08:29.435
KNOW, I SUPPORT ACTUALLY HAVING

02:08:29.501 --> 02:08:31.003
MORE THINGS SPELLED OUT IN, IN

02:08:31.070 --> 02:08:33.639
THE BILL IF POSSIBLE. BUT IF YOU

02:08:33.705 --> 02:08:35.007
DON'T HAVE REGULATIONS, WE'RE

02:08:35.074 --> 02:08:36.642
NOT GOING TO HAVE FEDERAL

02:08:36.708 --> 02:08:38.477
REGULATIONS TO START AS A FLOOR.

02:08:38.544 --> 02:08:39.511
SO IF YOU HAVE NO STATE

02:08:39.578 --> 02:08:40.379
REGULATORY BODY, YOU DON'T EVEN

02:08:40.446 --> 02:08:43.682
HAVE ACTUALLY A BACKDROP AGAINST

02:08:43.749 --> 02:08:47.820
WHICH LOCAL AGENCIES OR STATE

02:08:47.886 --> 02:08:50.689
AGENCIES THAT ARE ACTUALLY

02:08:50.756 --> 02:08:52.524
PERMITTING PIPELINES FOR THEM TO

02:08:52.591 --> 02:08:54.726
ACTUALLY GAUGE THEM AGAINST,

02:08:54.793 --> 02:08:56.495
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A FEDERAL

02:08:56.562 --> 02:08:57.930
RULE, WE DON'T HAVE FEDERAL

02:08:57.996 --> 02:08:58.931
REGULATIONS. AND WITHOUT THIS

02:08:58.997 --> 02:09:01.166
BILL, WE WOULDN'T HAVE ANY STATE

02:09:01.233 --> 02:09:02.734
REGULATIONS. AND I ASSUME THAT

02:09:02.801 --> 02:09:05.104
WHERE WE WOULD START IS, YOU

02:09:05.170 --> 02:09:07.439
KNOW, WOULD BE THAT THE FIRE

02:09:07.506 --> 02:09:08.907
MARSHAL WOULD BASICALLY START

02:09:08.974 --> 02:09:13.078
WITH THE WHAT IS IT, THE ACRONYM

02:09:13.145 --> 02:09:16.949
PHMSA. PHMSA. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

02:09:17.015 --> 02:09:19.118
AND ON THAT POINT ABOUT HAVING A

02:09:19.184 --> 02:09:20.719
LACK OF REGULATION, IF THIS

02:09:20.786 --> 02:09:22.387
DOESN'T GO FORTH, I THOUGHT

02:09:22.454 --> 02:09:24.123
SENATOR WEBER MADE THE MOST

02:09:24.189 --> 02:09:26.492
ELOQUENT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

02:09:26.558 --> 02:09:27.626
ARGUMENT FOR THIS BILL IN

02:09:27.693 --> 02:09:29.161
COMMITTEE IN THE SENATE. SHE

02:09:29.228 --> 02:09:30.395
SAID, LOOK, IN MY DISTRICT,

02:09:30.462 --> 02:09:32.798
THERE IS NO LOCATION TO

02:09:32.865 --> 02:09:35.000
SEQUESTER CARBON, BUT I HAVE

02:09:35.067 --> 02:09:37.102
PLENTY OF MANUFACTURING

02:09:37.169 --> 02:09:38.937
FACILITIES AND OTHER FACILITIES

02:09:39.004 --> 02:09:40.806
THAT CREATE A LOT OF CARBON. AND

02:09:40.873 --> 02:09:42.941
IF I DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY, IF

02:09:43.008 --> 02:09:43.809
MY DISTRICT, WE CAN'T TAKE

02:09:43.876 --> 02:09:45.444
CAPTURE THAT CARBON AND PUT IT

02:09:45.511 --> 02:09:46.612
INTO A PIPELINE SO IT CAN BE

02:09:46.678 --> 02:09:48.447
SEQUESTERED AT AN APPROPRIATE

02:09:48.514 --> 02:09:49.715
LOCATION, THERE'S GOING TO BE

02:09:49.781 --> 02:09:53.152
CARBON ISLANDS. AND SHE SAID, SO

02:09:53.218 --> 02:09:53.886
THE PIPELINE IS ACTUALLY AN

02:09:53.952 --> 02:09:55.254
ESSENTIAL TO A DISTRICT LIKE

02:09:55.320 --> 02:09:59.124
MINE. CAN I JUST CLARIFY THAT

02:09:59.191 --> 02:10:02.794
CURRENTLY, THE MORATORIUM IN 905

02:10:02.861 --> 02:10:05.397
STILL STANDS. YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY

02:10:05.464 --> 02:10:09.835
BUILD INTRASTATE PIPELINES

02:10:09.902 --> 02:10:14.206
UNTIL. IT'S NOT QUITE A MATTER

02:10:14.273 --> 02:10:16.308
OF THAT. THERE'S NO REGULATIONS

02:10:16.375 --> 02:10:18.777
RIGHT NOW IS THAT YOU CAN'T

02:10:18.844 --> 02:10:20.212
BUILD THEM. AND SO WHAT THIS

02:10:20.279 --> 02:10:21.680
BILL WOULD DO IS IT WOULD LIFT

02:10:21.747 --> 02:10:23.715
THE MORATORIUM TO SAY, GO AHEAD

02:10:23.782 --> 02:10:26.785
AND BUILD THEM. WITH THESE

02:10:26.852 --> 02:10:29.321
REGULATIONS IN PLACE. AND SO WE

02:10:29.388 --> 02:10:31.456
AGREE ON THE IF YOU WERE GOING

02:10:31.523 --> 02:10:33.725
TO LIFT THE MORATORIUM, THAT YOU

02:10:33.792 --> 02:10:34.660
SHOULD HAVE THESE REGULATIONS IN

02:10:34.726 --> 02:10:37.729
PLACE, BUT THE CURRENT SITUATION

02:10:37.796 --> 02:10:39.698
IS THAT THERE'S A MORATORIUM. SO

02:10:39.765 --> 02:10:41.533
IT'S NOT AS IF YOU DON'T HAVE

02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:43.802
THIS. AND WE AGREE THAT THE

02:10:43.869 --> 02:10:45.604
MORATORIUM IS A LITTLE SHAKY.

02:10:45.671 --> 02:10:46.538
BUT THE SITUATION IS RIGHT NOW

02:10:46.605 --> 02:10:48.540
IS THAT THERE IS A MORATORIUM.

02:10:48.607 --> 02:10:50.209
AND SO THE ALTERNATIVE TO THIS

02:10:50.275 --> 02:10:54.546
BILL IS NO BUILD VERSUS BUILD

02:10:54.613 --> 02:10:55.981
WITHOUT REGULATIONS, WHICH I

02:10:56.048 --> 02:10:57.516
HOPE THAT THE ALTERNATIVE,

02:10:57.583 --> 02:11:00.852
THOUGH, I THINK, IS THAT WE

02:11:00.919 --> 02:11:02.821
DON'T MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS.

02:11:02.888 --> 02:11:04.690
RIGHT? I MEAN, BECAUSE I THINK

02:11:04.756 --> 02:11:08.327
WHAT THIS MEANS IS LEAVING THE

02:11:08.393 --> 02:11:09.561
MORATORIUM IN PLACE AND WAITING

02:11:09.628 --> 02:11:10.963
UNTIL AFTER A FEDERAL RULE IS

02:11:11.029 --> 02:11:14.233
COMPLETE MEANS THAT BASICALLY,

02:11:14.299 --> 02:11:16.602
WE PUT A PAUSE ON EVERYTHING FOR

02:11:16.668 --> 02:11:18.837
AN INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME,

02:11:18.904 --> 02:11:21.073
AND PROBABLY AT LEAST THE NEXT

02:11:21.139 --> 02:11:22.874
THREE YEARS. ISN'T THAT ISN'T

02:11:22.941 --> 02:11:26.445
THAT CORRECT? YES, I WOULD SAY

02:11:26.511 --> 02:11:31.750
SO. OKAY. I MEAN, I I'M GLAD

02:11:31.817 --> 02:11:33.118
THAT YOU'RE CONTINUING TO TALK

02:11:33.185 --> 02:11:34.486
TO THE OPPONENTS. I THINK IT

02:11:34.553 --> 02:11:37.389
WOULD BE GOOD TO ACTUALLY

02:11:37.456 --> 02:11:39.358
CONTINUE THAT DIALOG AND TRY TO

02:11:39.424 --> 02:11:41.860
STRENGTHEN THE BILL. AND I'LL

02:11:41.927 --> 02:11:43.829
SEE HOW THIS TURNS OUT, AND

02:11:43.895 --> 02:11:46.565
WE'LL TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT IT.

02:11:46.632 --> 02:11:47.599
WHEN IT COMES TO THE FLOOR.

02:11:47.666 --> 02:11:50.769
THANKS. THANK YOU. SEEING NO

02:11:50.836 --> 02:11:52.537
OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM

02:11:52.604 --> 02:11:53.739
COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SENATOR

02:11:53.805 --> 02:11:57.075
STERN, WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE?

02:11:57.142 --> 02:11:59.411
THE OPPOSITION? I CONTINUE OUR

02:11:59.478 --> 02:12:02.080
COLLABORATION HERE. YEAH. WE

02:12:02.147 --> 02:12:03.915
WANTED TO CLARIFY IN THE CLOSING

02:12:03.982 --> 02:12:11.490
THAT THIS DOES APPLY. TO NEWLY

02:12:11.556 --> 02:12:15.494
CONSTRUCTED AND NOT THE EXISTING

02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:16.328
PIPELINE CONVERSIONS. AM I

02:12:16.395 --> 02:12:18.830
SAYING THAT RIGHT? YOU CAN'T USE

02:12:18.897 --> 02:12:19.831
THE BILL THANKS TO THE

02:12:19.898 --> 02:12:22.100
COMMITTEE. YOU CANNOT USE A

02:12:22.167 --> 02:12:23.835
BILL. PIPELINES THAT ARE BUILT

02:12:23.902 --> 02:12:24.870
FOR OTHER PURPOSES. YOU CAN'T

02:12:24.936 --> 02:12:27.105
USE THEM FOR CARBON DIOXIDE. SO

02:12:27.172 --> 02:12:28.974
THOSE THOSE ARE THE ONE. THAT'S

02:12:29.041 --> 02:12:29.808
THE ONE CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE MAYBE

02:12:29.875 --> 02:12:31.009
WHAT WE'RE SAYING DOESN'T APPLY

02:12:31.076 --> 02:12:32.377
IS THAT IF THERE WAS A WAY TO

02:12:32.444 --> 02:12:34.713
GET AROUND THE MORATORIUM FROM

02:12:34.780 --> 02:12:35.847
AN EXISTING PIPELINE, YOU COULD

02:12:35.914 --> 02:12:36.682
SORT OF SNEAK AROUND SAFETY

02:12:36.748 --> 02:12:38.583
STANDARDS. THIS PUTS A SAFETY

02:12:38.650 --> 02:12:40.319
STANDS IN FRONT OF THAT, TOO,

02:12:40.385 --> 02:12:42.487
AND ESTABLISHES WHAT WE THINK IS

02:12:42.554 --> 02:12:44.222
A REALLY PUBLIC PROCESS AND VERY

02:12:44.289 --> 02:12:46.725
OPEN TO MORE SPECIFICITY IN THE

02:12:46.792 --> 02:12:48.727
STATUTE ITSELF. WE'LL CERTAINLY

02:12:48.794 --> 02:12:50.062
BE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE

02:12:50.128 --> 02:12:51.763
CHAIR. NOT GOING TO TRY TO GET

02:12:51.830 --> 02:12:53.765
AHEAD OF YOU HERE, SIR, AND WANT

02:12:53.832 --> 02:12:54.700
TO COME BACK TO YOU, ESPECIALLY

02:12:54.766 --> 02:12:56.501
IF WE END UP LANDING ON

02:12:56.568 --> 02:12:58.170
PARTICULAR NUMBERS AROUND

02:12:58.236 --> 02:12:59.338
PLANNING ZONES, HEALTH

02:12:59.404 --> 02:13:00.572
PROTECTIVE ZONES. I STILL

02:13:00.639 --> 02:13:01.840
BELIEVE THAT SOME DISCRETION IS

02:13:01.907 --> 02:13:04.810
IMPORTANT HERE. I THINK THAT

02:13:04.876 --> 02:13:07.479
THIS THIS WORK IS A CRITICAL

02:13:07.546 --> 02:13:10.882
PART OF US MOVING OUR CLIMATE

02:13:10.949 --> 02:13:12.484
SOLUTIONS FORWARD. I GET THAT

02:13:12.551 --> 02:13:14.486
IT'S A IT MAYBE IS AN

02:13:14.553 --> 02:13:15.087
UNCOMFORTABLE SPACE FOR SOME.

02:13:15.153 --> 02:13:15.954
AND CERTAINLY ANYTHING DEALING

02:13:16.021 --> 02:13:17.522
WITH THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR. BUT

02:13:17.589 --> 02:13:19.291
JUST KEEP IN MIND THIS IS NOT

02:13:19.358 --> 02:13:20.926
JUST ABOUT OIL AND GAS, RIGHT.

02:13:20.992 --> 02:13:22.794
THIS IS ABOUT THIS IS ABOUT

02:13:22.861 --> 02:13:23.695
MAKING LIMESTONE OUT OF CEMENT

02:13:23.762 --> 02:13:24.730
PRODUCTION. THIS IS ABOUT DIRECT

02:13:24.796 --> 02:13:26.365
AIR CAPTURE AND WHAT YOU

02:13:26.431 --> 02:13:27.632
ACTUALLY DO WITH THAT CO2 WHEN

02:13:27.699 --> 02:13:29.368
IT'S WHEN IT'S MOVED FROM ONE

02:13:29.434 --> 02:13:32.804
SITE TO ANOTHER. SO I ESPECIALLY

02:13:32.871 --> 02:13:33.605
APPRECIATE THIS COMMITTEE

02:13:33.672 --> 02:13:36.041
SCRUTINY HERE, AND I'LL CONTINUE

02:13:36.108 --> 02:13:36.775
WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION. WE

02:13:36.842 --> 02:13:40.112
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR. THANK

02:13:40.178 --> 02:13:42.047
YOU, SENATOR, FOR YOUR CLOSE.

02:13:42.114 --> 02:13:44.750
THIS IS A COMPLICATED ISSUE, AN

02:13:44.816 --> 02:13:46.485
AWKWARD ISSUE, IF YOU WILL. BUT

02:13:46.551 --> 02:13:47.886
I THINK, YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER

02:13:47.953 --> 02:13:49.121
WHEN WE PASSED THAT LEGISLATION

02:13:49.187 --> 02:13:50.489
PUTTING THE MORATORIUM IN

02:13:50.555 --> 02:13:52.691
PENDING FEDERAL RULEMAKING,

02:13:52.758 --> 02:13:53.859
THESE WERE DRAFT RULES BY THE

02:13:53.925 --> 02:13:55.560
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. AND THE

02:13:55.627 --> 02:13:56.762
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION BECAME NO

02:13:56.828 --> 02:13:58.430
MORE. WE DON'T EXPECT GOOD

02:13:58.497 --> 02:14:01.099
FEDERAL RULES TO COME. BUT I

02:14:01.166 --> 02:14:02.901
THINK OPPOSITION HAS MADE A GOOD

02:14:02.968 --> 02:14:03.835
POINT ABOUT WHAT COMES FROM THE

02:14:03.902 --> 02:14:05.237
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS CERTAINLY

02:14:05.303 --> 02:14:06.738
THE FLOOR AND NOT THE CEILING.

02:14:06.805 --> 02:14:08.073
AND WHERE CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE

02:14:08.140 --> 02:14:10.475
ALLOWED TO PUSH TO MAKE SURE WE

02:14:10.542 --> 02:14:11.710
DO THINGS RIGHT, BECAUSE

02:14:11.777 --> 02:14:13.879
EVERYWHERE ELSE WILL FOLLOW US

02:14:13.945 --> 02:14:16.248
IF WE DO THINGS RIGHT. I TRUST

02:14:16.314 --> 02:14:17.382
THE SENATOR AND TAKE HIM AT HIS

02:14:17.449 --> 02:14:19.484
WORD THAT HE'LL CONTINUE TO WORK

02:14:19.551 --> 02:14:20.619
WITH US THROUGH THIS PROCESS.

02:14:20.685 --> 02:14:22.621
AND I THINK I WOULD ALWAYS

02:14:22.687 --> 02:14:24.189
PREFER AN ALLY IN AN AWKWARD

02:14:24.256 --> 02:14:25.490
POSITION THAN SOMEONE THAT MAY

02:14:25.557 --> 02:14:27.325
NOT HAVE THE BEST INTENTIONS

02:14:27.392 --> 02:14:27.893
TRYING TO DO SOMETHING THIS

02:14:27.959 --> 02:14:29.761
HEAVY. SO THANK YOU, SENATOR,

BILL 304. THIS BILL WOULD

02:15:45.570 --> 02:15:46.905
TEMPORARILY LIFT THE PUBLIC

SPECIFIC LAND IN JACK LONDON

02:15:50.675 --> 02:15:52.611
SQUARE, WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE

02:15:52.677 --> 02:15:53.712
PORT OF OAKLAND TO LEASE THIS

02:15:53.778 --> 02:15:55.814
LAND FOR ANY USE, BUT WILL BE

02:15:55.881 --> 02:15:58.116
REQUIRED TO MEET CERTAIN

02:15:58.183 --> 02:15:59.451
CONDITIONS AS PART OF THAT LEASE

02:15:59.518 --> 02:16:00.752
PROCESS. THIS IS A DISTRICT

02:16:00.819 --> 02:16:02.754
BILL. THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY

02:16:02.821 --> 02:16:03.488
REPRESENTS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN

THE PORT OF OAKLAND AND THE

STATE LANDS COMMISSION. I WANT

02:16:07.025 --> 02:16:08.426
TO THANK THE PORT AND THE

COMMISSION FOR THEIR ONGOING

02:16:09.794 --> 02:16:11.463
COLLABORATION TO ENSURE THAT

02:16:11.530 --> 02:16:12.898
JACK LONDON SQUARE CAN BE A

02:16:12.964 --> 02:16:13.698
VIBRANT NEIGHBORHOOD FOR

02:16:13.765 --> 02:16:15.800
EVERYONE. SB 304 SEEKS TO

02:16:15.867 --> 02:16:16.635
ADDRESS THE ONGOING CHALLENGES

02:16:16.701 --> 02:16:18.436
IN MY DISTRICT AT JACK LONDON

02:16:18.503 --> 02:16:20.672
SQUARE THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED

02:16:20.739 --> 02:16:22.073
DUE TO A DECLINE IN CUSTOMER

02:16:22.140 --> 02:16:24.175
FOOT TRAFFIC, THE COVID 19

02:16:24.242 --> 02:16:26.011
PANDEMIC AND THE DEPARTURE OF

02:16:26.077 --> 02:16:27.345
OAKLAND'S PROFESSIONAL SPORTS

02:16:27.412 --> 02:16:29.681
TEAMS. THE CURRENT SITUATION IN

02:16:29.748 --> 02:16:31.550
JACQUELINE AND SQUARE'S DIRE,

02:16:31.616 --> 02:16:33.585
APPROXIMATELY 52% OF THE

02:16:33.652 --> 02:16:34.252
NEIGHBORHOOD'S GROUND FLOOR

02:16:34.319 --> 02:16:36.521
SPACE IS CURRENTLY VACANT, WHICH

02:16:36.588 --> 02:16:39.257
ACCOUNTS FOR 183,000 COMMERCIAL

02:16:39.324 --> 02:16:41.493
SQUARE FEET. BY PROVIDING A

02:16:41.560 --> 02:16:42.661
NARROW AND TEMPORARY LIFTING OF

02:16:42.727 --> 02:16:44.429
THE USE RESTRICTIONS AT JACK

LONDON SQUARE, WE HAVE THE

02:16:46.031 --> 02:16:47.332
POTENTIAL TO REVITALIZE THE

02:16:47.399 --> 02:16:48.833
NEIGHBORHOOD AND FACILITATE THE

02:16:48.900 --> 02:16:49.601
PUBLIC'S USE AND ENJOYMENT OF

MANDATES OF THAT PUBLIC TRUST

02:16:54.172 --> 02:16:55.974
DOCTRINE. THE LIFTING OF THE

02:16:56.041 --> 02:16:57.342
TRUST WOULD AFFECT LESS THAN

02:16:57.409 --> 02:16:58.743
HALF A PERCENT OF THE PORT'S

02:16:58.810 --> 02:17:01.012
OVERALL GRANTED LANDS, AND WOULD

02:17:01.079 --> 02:17:02.647
REQUIRE THE PORT TO REPORT TO

02:17:02.714 --> 02:17:04.482
THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION ON AN

02:17:04.549 --> 02:17:06.117

OF JACK LONDON SQUARE. IN

02:17:10.021 --> 02:17:11.189
ADDITION, THE PORT MUST MEET

02:17:11.256 --> 02:17:12.490
CERTAIN CONDITIONS WHEN THEY

02:17:12.557 --> 02:17:13.892
LEASE PROPERTIES FOR NON-TRUST

02:17:13.959 --> 02:17:15.293
USES, SUCH AS ENSURING THAT

02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:17.829
NON-TRUST USES DO NOT IMPAIR OR

02:17:17.896 --> 02:17:19.497
HARM EXISTING PUBLIC TRUST USES,

02:17:19.564 --> 02:17:21.633
AND THAT SUCH LEASES PROMOTE THE

02:17:21.700 --> 02:17:23.435
USE AND ENJOYMENT OF THE

02:17:23.501 --> 02:17:24.669
WATERFRONT. WITH ME TO TESTIFY

02:17:24.736 --> 02:17:26.304
IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS THE

02:17:29.975 --> 02:17:30.942
GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS MANAGER FOR

02:17:31.009 --> 02:17:32.844
THE PORT OF OAKLAND. AT THE

02:17:32.911 --> 02:17:34.579
APPROPRIATE TIME, RESPECTFULLY

02:17:34.646 --> 02:17:37.882
ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. ALL RIGHT. SO

02:17:37.949 --> 02:17:39.618
THANK YOU SO MUCH, CHAIR BRYANT

02:17:39.684 --> 02:17:40.552
AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY

02:17:40.619 --> 02:17:42.320
NAME IS KEVIN JENKINS. I'M THE

02:17:42.387 --> 02:17:43.888
PRESIDENT OF THE OAKLAND CITY

02:17:43.955 --> 02:17:44.456
COUNCIL. I'M HERE TODAY TO

02:17:44.522 --> 02:17:46.891
EXPRESS MY STRONG SUPPORT FOR SB

02:17:46.958 --> 02:17:48.093
304, WHICH REPRESENTS A FIRST

02:17:48.159 --> 02:17:49.628
STEP TOWARDS GIVING OAKLAND THE

02:17:49.694 --> 02:17:51.696
TOOLS WE NEED TO REACTIVATE JACK

02:17:51.763 --> 02:17:53.098
LONDON SQUARE AND BRING

02:17:53.164 --> 02:17:55.033
MEANINGFUL CHANGE TO OUR

02:17:55.100 --> 02:17:56.501
WATERFRONT. WE EMBRACE OUR

02:17:56.568 --> 02:17:58.269
MARITIME LEGACY. IT'S PART OF

02:17:58.336 --> 02:18:00.005
WHO WE ARE, BUT WE ALSO

02:18:00.071 --> 02:18:01.673
RECOGNIZE THAT THE PORT OF

02:18:01.740 --> 02:18:02.674
OAKLAND IS MORE THAN A SHIPPING

02:18:02.741 --> 02:18:04.576
GATEWAY. IT'S ONE OF THE MOST

02:18:04.643 --> 02:18:05.810
VALUABLE ASSETS THAT THE CITY OF

02:18:05.877 --> 02:18:07.912
OAKLAND HAS, AND WE MUST ENSURE

02:18:07.979 --> 02:18:09.748
THAT IT CAN SERVE THE EVOLVING

02:18:09.814 --> 02:18:11.750
NEEDS OF THE PUBLIC. OAKLAND

02:18:11.816 --> 02:18:14.085
CONTINUES TO FACE CHALLENGING

02:18:14.152 --> 02:18:15.687
CIRCUMSTANCES, HIGH COMMERCIAL

02:18:15.754 --> 02:18:18.023
VACANCIES AND UNEVEN RECOVERY

02:18:18.089 --> 02:18:19.791
FROM THE PANDEMIC, AND A

02:18:19.858 --> 02:18:21.292
SHIFTING ECONOMIC LANDSCAPE THAT

02:18:21.359 --> 02:18:23.194
DEMANDS MORE FLEXIBLE,

02:18:23.261 --> 02:18:24.529
RESPONSIVE SOLUTIONS FROM ALL

02:18:24.596 --> 02:18:26.364
LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. SO MY HOPE

02:18:26.431 --> 02:18:29.367
IS THAT THIS BILL IS NOT THE END

02:18:29.434 --> 02:18:31.036
OF THE CONVERSATION, BUT THE

02:18:31.102 --> 02:18:32.604
BEGINNING. IT'S THE FIRST STEP

02:18:32.671 --> 02:18:34.572
TOWARDS REIMAGINING A WATERFRONT

02:18:34.639 --> 02:18:35.874
THAT WORKS FOR ALL OF OAKLAND,

02:18:35.940 --> 02:18:37.776
WHILE PRESERVING OVERSIGHT AND

02:18:37.842 --> 02:18:39.477
STAYING TRUE TO THE PRINCIPLES

02:18:39.544 --> 02:18:41.379
OF PUBLIC STEWARDSHIP. SO I WANT

02:18:41.446 --> 02:18:43.248
TO THANK SENATOR ERIC AND THE

02:18:43.314 --> 02:18:44.516
PORT OF OAKLAND FOR THEIR

02:18:44.582 --> 02:18:45.483
WILLINGNESS TO WORK CLOSELY WITH

02:18:45.550 --> 02:18:46.751
THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION ON

02:18:46.818 --> 02:18:48.019
THE LANGUAGE BEFORE THIS

02:18:48.086 --> 02:18:49.654
COMMITTEE, THEIR COLLABORATIVE

SPIRIT, AND THEIR SHARED DESIRE

02:18:50.922 --> 02:18:53.158
TO FIND SOLUTIONS. AND WHAT MADE

02:18:53.224 --> 02:18:55.226
THIS LEGISLATION POSSIBLE. SO WE

02:18:55.293 --> 02:18:57.929
HOPE THIS EFFORT BECOMES A MODEL

02:18:57.996 --> 02:18:58.930
FOR SUCCESS, ONE THAT CAN BE

02:18:58.997 --> 02:19:00.365
BUILT UPON TO REALIZE THE LONG

02:19:00.432 --> 02:19:02.667

02:19:03.702 --> 02:19:06.638
ACCESSIBLE OAKLAND WATERFRONT. I

02:19:06.705 --> 02:19:07.972
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR

02:19:08.039 --> 02:19:10.508

02:19:45.877 --> 02:19:48.113
SOLUTION, ALLOWING FOR LIMITED,

02:19:48.179 --> 02:19:49.948
EXPANDED USES ON SPECIFIC

02:19:50.014 --> 02:19:51.583
PORTIONS OF JACK LONDON SQUARE

02:19:51.649 --> 02:19:52.784
WITHOUT REMOVING THOSE LANDS

02:19:52.851 --> 02:19:55.086
FROM THE PUBLIC TRUST. WHEN MANY

02:19:55.153 --> 02:19:56.421
OF THE STATE'S DOWNTOWNS AND

02:19:56.488 --> 02:19:58.556
PUBLIC SPACES ARE STRUGGLING

02:19:58.623 --> 02:20:00.024
POST-COVID, THIS LEGISLATION

02:20:00.091 --> 02:20:01.626
TAKES A DEEP LOOK AT THE PUBLIC

02:20:01.693 --> 02:20:03.461
ASSETS WE CURRENTLY HAVE AND HOW

02:20:03.528 --> 02:20:06.030
WE CAN UNLOCK THEIR POTENTIAL.

02:20:06.097 --> 02:20:08.299
THIS APPROACH IS TRANSPARENT AND

02:20:08.366 --> 02:20:09.267
ACCOUNTABLE, WITH STRONG

02:20:09.334 --> 02:20:11.469
OVERSIGHT FROM THE STATE LANDS

02:20:11.536 --> 02:20:12.804

02:20:14.672 --> 02:20:17.609
ALIGNMENT WITH THE PUBLIC TRUST.

02:20:17.675 --> 02:20:19.277
BUT THIS IS THE FIRST STEP. IT

02:20:19.344 --> 02:20:21.246
OPENS THE DOOR TO ONGOING

02:20:21.312 --> 02:20:22.313
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW WE CAN

02:20:22.380 --> 02:20:24.249
FULLY REVITALIZE JACK LONDON

WELCOMING DESTINATION ON

02:20:26.851 --> 02:20:28.787
OAKLAND'S PUBLIC WATERFRONT. IN.

02:20:28.853 --> 02:20:30.588
THE ULTIMATE GOAL HERE IS TO

02:20:30.655 --> 02:20:32.390
ALLOW A BROADER RANGE OF USES

02:20:32.457 --> 02:20:34.392

02:20:34.459 --> 02:20:35.593

INCOMES TO THE WATERFRONT,

02:20:37.462 --> 02:20:38.563
ACTIVATING PUBLIC SPACES,

02:20:38.630 --> 02:20:40.331

THAT REFLECTS THE NEEDS AND

02:20:45.436 --> 02:20:47.138
ENERGY OF THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY.

02:20:47.205 --> 02:20:49.240
THIS LEGISLATION HELPS LAY THAT

02:20:49.307 --> 02:20:50.775

HEALTH'S NEW HOSPITAL CAMPUS IN

02:23:47.919 --> 02:23:49.120

02:24:24.022 --> 02:24:25.456
THAT THE EAST BAY CONTINUES TO

DESERVE. I'M HAPPY THAT THIS

02:24:29.560 --> 02:24:32.030
BILL, SB 830, WOULD ENABLE THE

02:24:32.096 --> 02:24:34.499
CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW MEDICAL

02:24:34.565 --> 02:24:36.134

ALL THE SERVICES THAT BERKELEY

02:24:38.202 --> 02:24:39.837
CURRENTLY PROVIDES, ENSURING

02:24:39.904 --> 02:24:41.472

02:24:47.912 --> 02:24:49.313
AREA, WHICH I AM PROUD TO

02:24:49.380 --> 02:24:51.049
REPRESENT, HAS A NUMBER OF

02:24:51.115 --> 02:24:54.919
HAZARD RISKS FROM WILDFIRE RISK.

02:24:54.986 --> 02:24:56.487
THE HAYWARD FAULT GOING THROUGH

02:24:56.554 --> 02:24:57.889
A PORTION OF THE CITY OF

BERKELEY. IN ADDITION. THE

02:25:02.560 --> 02:25:03.694
CLOSURE OF OTHER MEDICAL

02:25:03.761 --> 02:25:05.063
FACILITIES IN THE AREA HAS

02:25:05.129 --> 02:25:08.299
CREATED INCREASED STRENGTH ON

02:25:08.366 --> 02:25:09.834
HEALTHCARE FACILITIES IN THE

02:25:09.901 --> 02:25:11.502
AREA. DOCTORS HOSPITAL AND CITY

THE CLOSURE OF THE ALTA BATES

02:25:15.540 --> 02:25:16.274
BERKELEY HOSPITAL WILL ADD

02:25:16.340 --> 02:25:17.341
FURTHER STRAIN ON EXISTING

02:25:17.408 --> 02:25:19.444
MEDICAL SERVICES. AND THIS. IF

02:25:19.510 --> 02:25:21.345
WE DON'T DO SOMETHING, WE'LL

02:25:21.412 --> 02:25:22.413
CREATE A HOSPITAL DESERT IN A

02:25:22.480 --> 02:25:24.282
LARGE PORTION OF THE EAST BAY,

02:25:24.348 --> 02:25:25.616
LEAVING MY CONSTITUENTS WITHOUT

02:25:25.683 --> 02:25:27.552
THE ACCESS TO A FULL SERVICE

02:25:27.618 --> 02:25:28.219
ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL AND

02:25:28.286 --> 02:25:30.254
EMERGENCY ROOM. SO SUTTER'S

02:25:30.321 --> 02:25:31.889
PROPOSAL TO BUILD A NEW MEDICAL

02:25:31.956 --> 02:25:33.458
CENTER NOT TOO FAR FROM THE

02:25:33.524 --> 02:25:36.027
EXISTING BERKELEY HOSPITAL WILL

02:25:36.094 --> 02:25:37.528
ENSURE THAT THIS PROJECT IS

02:25:37.595 --> 02:25:40.898
BUILT AND CAN PROVIDE A

02:25:40.965 --> 02:25:41.933
CONTINUATION OF HEALTHCARE

02:25:41.999 --> 02:25:44.035

02:25:44.102 --> 02:25:46.070
MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN EXPEDITE

CREATING A STREAMLINED PROCESS

02:25:58.483 --> 02:25:59.917
TO ENSURE THIS PROJECT CAN BE

02:25:59.984 --> 02:26:00.952
BUILT WITHOUT DELAYS OR

02:26:01.018 --> 02:26:01.819
OBSTACLES. ENSURING THAT EAST

02:26:01.886 --> 02:26:03.421
BAY COMMUNITIES ARE LEFT WITHOUT

02:26:03.488 --> 02:26:05.523
A HOSPITAL. WITHOUT A HOSPITAL.

02:26:05.590 --> 02:26:07.225
SO IN ORDER TO RECEIVE SEQUA

02:26:07.291 --> 02:26:08.593
STREAMLINING, SUTTER MUST MEET

02:26:08.659 --> 02:26:10.328

IN AN INVESTMENT OF $1 BILLION,

02:26:18.269 --> 02:26:20.071
AND THAT THE PROJECT IS AN URBAN

02:26:20.138 --> 02:26:22.840

SUTTER WOULD ALSO HAVE TO MEET

02:26:25.810 --> 02:26:26.878
AS PART OF THIS THIS

02:26:26.944 --> 02:26:27.945

ENCOUNTER A SQL LAWSUIT, SB 830

WHEN I WAS FOUR YEARS OLD, I

02:32:09.687 --> 02:32:10.855
BELIEVE, AND HOSPITALS HAVE HAD

02:32:10.921 --> 02:32:13.491
A LOT OF TIME TO GET IN

02:33:46.450 --> 02:33:47.651
AND THANK YOU, MISTER CHAIR

MEMBERS FOR ALLOWING ME TO

02:33:48.719 --> 02:33:50.888
PRESENT THE BILL TODAY. SB 486

02:33:50.955 --> 02:33:52.790
IS A BILL INTENDED AT ITS CORE

02:33:52.856 --> 02:33:54.625
TO MAKE REAL THE PROMISE OF THE

02:33:54.692 --> 02:33:56.160
MASTER PLAN FOR HIGHER EDUCATION

02:33:56.226 --> 02:33:58.662
THAT EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIAN,

02:33:58.729 --> 02:34:00.364
IF THEY ARE ABLE TO REACH THE

02:34:00.431 --> 02:34:02.032
TOP ONE THIRD OF THEIR HIGH

02:34:02.099 --> 02:34:03.367
SCHOOL OF THE HIGH SCHOOL

02:34:03.434 --> 02:34:04.501
GRADUATING CLASS, OR THE TOP ONE

02:34:04.568 --> 02:34:05.970
EIGHTH THAT THEY ARE FULLY

02:34:06.036 --> 02:34:08.439
ENTITLED TO GO TO UC OR CSU,

02:34:08.505 --> 02:34:09.473
THAT HAS BEEN LONGSTANDING STATE

02:34:09.540 --> 02:34:12.710
POLICY SINCE 1960, AND IT IS A

02:34:12.776 --> 02:34:14.712
BEDROCK OF WHAT CALIFORNIANS

02:34:14.778 --> 02:34:16.413
EXPECT FROM THEIR GOVERNMENT AND

02:34:16.480 --> 02:34:18.182
FROM THE STATE, AND FOR GOOD

02:34:18.248 --> 02:34:19.583
REASON, BECAUSE THERE ARE VERY

02:34:19.650 --> 02:34:22.653
FEW THINGS THAT GUARANTEE

02:34:22.720 --> 02:34:24.989
SKIPPING A SOCIAL CLASS. ALMOST

02:34:25.055 --> 02:34:26.457
100% GUARANTEE OF SKIPPING A

02:34:26.523 --> 02:34:28.225
SOCIAL CLASS. IF YOU COME FROM A

02:34:28.292 --> 02:34:29.560
LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOOD IN

02:34:29.627 --> 02:34:31.895
IRVINE, CALIFORNIA, AND YOU GO

02:34:31.962 --> 02:34:33.864
TO UCLA, TO BERKELEY, TO UC SAN

02:34:33.931 --> 02:34:35.699
DIEGO, MAYBE UC DAVIS, IN MY

02:34:35.766 --> 02:34:37.601
DISTRICT, IT'S ALMOST FOR SURE

02:34:37.668 --> 02:34:39.637
THAT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY WILL

02:34:39.703 --> 02:34:41.171
PERMANENTLY SKIP A SOCIAL CLASS.

02:34:41.238 --> 02:34:43.674
WE CRACK THAT NUT IN CALIFORNIA

02:34:43.741 --> 02:34:46.910
NOW 65 YEARS AGO, AND YET WE

02:34:46.977 --> 02:34:48.679
HAVE FOUND A WAY TO MAKE THAT

02:34:48.746 --> 02:34:49.613
AVAILABLE ONLY TO BASICALLY THE

02:34:49.680 --> 02:34:50.781
SAME PROPORTION OF CALIFORNIA

02:34:50.848 --> 02:34:53.784
THAT WE DID BACK THEN. AND IN

02:34:53.851 --> 02:34:55.619
PART, THE REST OF THE COUNTRY

02:34:55.686 --> 02:34:57.888
HAS MOVED ON. OHIO STATE, 80,000

02:34:57.955 --> 02:35:00.290
STUDENTS, MICHIGAN STATE CLOSE.

02:35:00.357 --> 02:35:01.625
UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA CLOSE

02:35:01.692 --> 02:35:03.494
OUR INSTITUTIONS, OUR PREMIER

02:35:03.560 --> 02:35:05.562
INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE BASICALLY

02:35:05.629 --> 02:35:07.398
GUARANTEES OF CLASS OF CLASS

02:35:07.464 --> 02:35:09.166
SKIPPING. WE'VE KEPT AROUND

02:35:09.233 --> 02:35:11.468
30,000 STUDENTS EVER SINCE. AND

02:35:11.535 --> 02:35:13.003
THAT'S IN PART BECAUSE FOR

02:35:13.070 --> 02:35:14.972
PURPOSES OF CEQA AND SOME

02:35:15.039 --> 02:35:16.707
JURISPRUDENCE, WE'VE TREATED

02:35:16.774 --> 02:35:17.875
CAMPUS ENROLLMENT AS THOUGH IT

02:35:17.941 --> 02:35:20.678
IS A LOCAL DECISION. WE'VE ACTED

02:35:20.744 --> 02:35:22.413
AS THOUGH UC'S OVERALL

02:35:22.479 --> 02:35:23.614
ENROLLMENT AND THEIR COMMITMENT

02:35:23.681 --> 02:35:25.816
TO THE MASTER PLAN IS SOMEHOW

02:35:25.883 --> 02:35:27.384
YOU CALL LIKE THE PRESIDENT

02:35:27.451 --> 02:35:29.420
CALLS UP THE CHANCELLOR AT UCLA

02:35:29.486 --> 02:35:30.621
SAYS, HEY, HOW MANY, HOW MANY

02:35:30.688 --> 02:35:32.356
STUDENTS ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE?

02:35:32.423 --> 02:35:34.625
AND THEN HOW MANY ARE YOU GOING

02:35:34.692 --> 02:35:35.592
TO TAKE AT BERKELEY? AND THEN

02:35:35.659 --> 02:35:37.327
THEY JUST ALL THE PRESIDENT DOES

02:35:37.394 --> 02:35:38.495
IS ADD IT UP. AND THAT'S THE

02:35:38.562 --> 02:35:40.397
MASTER PLAN. WELL, THAT'S NOT

02:35:40.464 --> 02:35:42.399
THE MASTER PLAN. THE MASTER PLAN

02:35:42.466 --> 02:35:43.567
IS STATE POLICY. IT'S UC AND CSU

02:35:43.634 --> 02:35:44.635
POLICY. AND EVERY YEAR IN THE

02:35:44.702 --> 02:35:46.603
BUDGET, THE LEGISLATURE SAYS

02:35:46.670 --> 02:35:47.504
WHAT THE ENROLLMENT IS GOING TO

02:35:47.571 --> 02:35:48.706
BE. SO ENROLLMENT AT UC AND CSU

02:35:48.772 --> 02:35:50.874
ARE NOT LOCAL DECISIONS. THEY

02:35:50.941 --> 02:35:51.542
ARE NOT CAMPUS DECISIONS. THEY

02:35:51.608 --> 02:35:52.576
ARE STATEWIDE CONCERNS THAT THE

02:35:52.643 --> 02:35:53.844
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA ARE

02:35:53.911 --> 02:35:56.513
STRONGLY VESTED IN. AND WE HEAR

02:35:56.580 --> 02:35:58.215
THAT ALL THE TIME IN TERMS OF

02:35:58.282 --> 02:35:59.283
PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR HIGHER

02:35:59.349 --> 02:36:01.518
EDUCATION AS WELL. MY KID CANNOT

02:36:01.585 --> 02:36:02.653
GET INTO BERKELEY. WE SAY, WELL,

02:36:02.720 --> 02:36:04.188
GO TO MERCED, AND MERCED IS A

02:36:04.254 --> 02:36:05.355
FINE INSTITUTION, BUT FOR A

02:36:05.422 --> 02:36:06.490
LARGE NUMBER, PARTICULARLY OF

02:36:06.557 --> 02:36:08.559
LOW INCOME FAMILIES IN URBAN LA

02:36:08.625 --> 02:36:10.994
AND IN URBAN BAY AREA, WHO

02:36:11.061 --> 02:36:12.629
CANNOT RELOCATE BECAUSE THE VAST

02:36:12.696 --> 02:36:13.630
MAJORITY OF STUDENTS ATTEND A

02:36:13.697 --> 02:36:15.432
SCHOOL WITHIN THEIR IN THEIR IN

02:36:15.499 --> 02:36:17.000
THEIR HOME REGION, THEY CANNOT

02:36:17.067 --> 02:36:19.069
RELOCATE. SO IT'S NOT A REAL

02:36:19.136 --> 02:36:19.903
FULFILLMENT OF OUR PROMISE IN

02:36:19.970 --> 02:36:21.672
THE MASTER PLAN TO SAY, JUST GO

02:36:21.739 --> 02:36:22.773
TO A DIFFERENT, AN ENTIRELY

02:36:22.840 --> 02:36:24.475
DIFFERENT REGION OF THE STATE

02:36:24.541 --> 02:36:26.643
BECAUSE YOU HAPPEN TO LIVE IN A

02:36:26.710 --> 02:36:27.745
PLACE WHERE WE'VE SETTLED, WHERE

02:36:27.811 --> 02:36:29.079
WE'VE LET THE WE'VE LET

02:36:29.146 --> 02:36:30.948
ACTIVISTS IN WESTWOOD, LA JOLLA,

02:36:31.014 --> 02:36:32.716
BERKELEY AND DAVIS DECIDE WHAT

02:36:32.783 --> 02:36:34.251
ENROLLMENT IS GOING TO BE FOR

02:36:34.318 --> 02:36:36.053
CSU. SO THAT'S THE BACKDROP OF

02:36:36.120 --> 02:36:38.522
THE BILL. HAVING SAID THAT, IT'S

02:36:38.589 --> 02:36:40.090
THERE ARE NO SWISS CHEESE HERE

02:36:40.157 --> 02:36:41.258
BECAUSE IT'S A MODEST BILL. THIS

02:36:41.325 --> 02:36:44.294
BILL IS NOT A CEQA EXEMPTION. IT

02:36:44.361 --> 02:36:49.666
SIMPLY SAYS THAT THAT PROJECTS

02:36:49.733 --> 02:36:51.201
THAT THE NO PROJECT ALTERNATIVE,

02:36:51.268 --> 02:36:52.669
WHICH IS TO SAY, HEY, YOU KNOW,

02:36:52.736 --> 02:36:54.271
WE'RE NOT GOING TO SERVE MORE

02:36:54.338 --> 02:36:55.439
STUDENTS, THAT THAT DOES NOT

02:36:55.506 --> 02:36:57.307
HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED IN A, IN

02:36:57.374 --> 02:36:59.743
A, IN A LOCAL PROJECT ANALYSIS,

02:36:59.810 --> 02:37:01.178
BECAUSE IT IS NOT A LOCAL

02:37:01.245 --> 02:37:02.246
DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER OR

02:37:02.312 --> 02:37:05.649
NOT TO GROW. NOW WE'VE WE HAVE,

02:37:05.716 --> 02:37:07.284
I DON'T WANT TO SAY SOLVED, BUT

02:37:07.351 --> 02:37:08.318
WE'VE MADE A LOT YOU HAVE MADE

02:37:08.385 --> 02:37:10.554
BECAUSE I WASN'T ELECTED YET. A

02:37:10.621 --> 02:37:11.188
LOT OF PROGRESS ON THE HOUSING

02:37:11.255 --> 02:37:12.523
SIDE OF THE EQUATION WHERE WE

02:37:12.589 --> 02:37:14.691
HAVE DONE THIS. BUT THE BUT A

02:37:14.758 --> 02:37:15.726
DORM ROOM DOESN'T MAKE ANY

02:37:15.793 --> 02:37:16.627
DIFFERENCE IF YOU CAN'T GET

02:37:16.693 --> 02:37:18.428
ADMITTED BECAUSE THERE ISN'T

02:37:18.495 --> 02:37:19.563
CLASSROOM SPACE. THERE'S NO ROOM

02:37:19.630 --> 02:37:20.230
IN THE COUNSELING CENTER.

02:37:20.297 --> 02:37:21.698
THERE'S NO PARKING FOR THE

02:37:21.765 --> 02:37:22.800
FACULTY, THERE'S NO ELECTRICITY

02:37:22.866 --> 02:37:24.601
ON THE CAMPUS. ALL OF THE

02:37:24.668 --> 02:37:25.903
CAMPUSES FACILITIES ARE

02:37:25.969 --> 02:37:27.471
NECESSARY IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT

02:37:27.538 --> 02:37:30.741
THAT THAT REAL. JUST A FEW YEARS

02:37:30.808 --> 02:37:32.810
AGO, MILLS COLLEGE IN THE BAY

02:37:32.876 --> 02:37:34.478
AREA IN OAKLAND ANNOUNCED IT

02:37:34.545 --> 02:37:36.847
COULD NO LONGER IT WAS NO LONGER

02:37:36.914 --> 02:37:38.282
A VIABLE ENTERPRISE. AND AT THE

02:37:38.348 --> 02:37:39.349
TIME, THE CHANCELLOR AT UC

02:37:39.416 --> 02:37:41.752
BERKELEY WAS VERY INTERESTED IN

02:37:41.819 --> 02:37:42.886
ACQUIRING OR MERGING WITH THAT

02:37:42.953 --> 02:37:45.189
CAMPUS IN ORDER TO ADD THOUSANDS

02:37:45.255 --> 02:37:47.124
OF SEATS TO THE TO THE NATION'S

02:37:47.191 --> 02:37:48.425
MOST PRESTIGIOUS PUBLIC

02:37:48.492 --> 02:37:50.160
UNIVERSITIES. SORRY, UCLA,

02:37:50.227 --> 02:37:51.728
THEY'RE PRETTY CLOSE. I WENT TO

02:37:51.795 --> 02:37:53.397
BOTH. WE WILL BE CALLING A

02:37:53.463 --> 02:37:55.299
BRIEF. I JUST I JUST LOST FOUR

02:37:55.365 --> 02:37:58.735
VOTES, BUT A RECESS. SO TO ADD

02:37:58.802 --> 02:38:00.637
THOUSANDS OF SEATS AT ONCE TO

02:38:00.704 --> 02:38:01.939
ONE OF THE TWO CAMPUSES, MAYBE

02:38:02.005 --> 02:38:03.907
ONE OF THE FIVE IN CALIFORNIA

02:38:03.974 --> 02:38:05.275
THAT EVERYONE KNOWS IS A

02:38:05.342 --> 02:38:07.511
GUARANTEED ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY

02:38:07.578 --> 02:38:09.546
GAME CHANGER. AND SO THE

02:38:09.613 --> 02:38:11.381
CHANCELLOR THERE WAS PREPARED TO

02:38:11.448 --> 02:38:13.817
MOVE FORWARD ON THAT. NOW,

02:38:13.884 --> 02:38:14.451
HERE'S THE PROBLEM. IT WASN'T

02:38:14.518 --> 02:38:15.752
BECAUSE NOBODY PLANNED ON THIS.

02:38:15.819 --> 02:38:17.554
IT WASN'T IN THE LONG RANGE

02:38:17.621 --> 02:38:18.722
DEVELOPMENT PLAN FOR THE CAMPUS.

02:38:18.789 --> 02:38:20.490
IT WASN'T IN THE CAMPUS'S TEN

02:38:20.557 --> 02:38:22.292
YEAR MASTER PLAN. IT COULDN'T

02:38:22.359 --> 02:38:23.594
BE. AND THEREFORE, AS THE

02:38:23.660 --> 02:38:24.595
CHANCELLOR WAS TRYING TO

02:38:24.661 --> 02:38:25.762
NEGOTIATE THIS PROCESS, ONE OF

02:38:25.829 --> 02:38:28.165
THE PRINCIPAL BARRIERS WAS THE

02:38:28.232 --> 02:38:29.766
STATUTE THAT SAID THAT THEY HAD

02:38:29.833 --> 02:38:31.501
TO CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF THAT

02:38:31.568 --> 02:38:33.036
THIS WOULD HAVE ON ENROLLMENT

02:38:33.103 --> 02:38:33.837
GROWTH, WHICH IT CERTAINLY

02:38:33.904 --> 02:38:35.572
WOULD. IT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT

02:38:35.639 --> 02:38:37.307
HERE IN SACRAMENTO, WHICH IS FOR

02:38:37.374 --> 02:38:39.142
BERKELEY AND THESE OTHER

02:38:39.209 --> 02:38:40.310
CAMPUSES TO GROW. BUT WE HAVE UP

02:38:40.377 --> 02:38:41.478
TO THIS POINT, WE'VE TREATED

02:38:41.545 --> 02:38:43.814
STUDENTS AS THOUGH NOT JUST IN

02:38:43.881 --> 02:38:44.715
THEIR HOUSING, BUT IN THEIR

02:38:44.781 --> 02:38:45.515
CLASSES THEMSELVES. THEY ARE

02:38:45.582 --> 02:38:46.483
POLLUTION. SO THE BILL MERELY

02:38:46.550 --> 02:38:49.286
SAYS THAT THAT PROJECTS, IF THEY

02:38:49.353 --> 02:38:50.954
ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE REGIONAL

02:38:51.021 --> 02:38:52.389
SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PLAN. SO

02:38:52.456 --> 02:38:54.925
WHAT THE MPOS DEVELOP FOR

02:38:54.992 --> 02:38:55.959
TRANSPORTATION, CIRCULATION AND

02:38:56.026 --> 02:38:57.294
CLIMATE, IF THEY ARE CONSISTENT

02:38:57.361 --> 02:39:00.330
WITH THAT PLAN THAT THEY DO NOT,

02:39:00.397 --> 02:39:01.632
AND THEY AND THE ENROLLMENT

02:39:01.698 --> 02:39:02.766
MATCHES WHAT THE ENROLLMENT IS,

02:39:02.833 --> 02:39:04.201
THAT'S BEEN SUBMITTED BY THE

02:39:04.268 --> 02:39:05.435
PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF

02:39:05.502 --> 02:39:06.737
CALIFORNIA TO THE REGION, THAT

02:39:06.803 --> 02:39:08.238
THEY DON'T HAVE TO CONDUCT THE

02:39:08.305 --> 02:39:09.907
NO PROJECT ALTERNATIVE, THE WHAT

02:39:09.973 --> 02:39:12.242
IF WE DON'T GROW ALTERNATIVE?

02:39:12.309 --> 02:39:13.510
THAT'S THE THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF

02:39:13.577 --> 02:39:15.512
THE BILL. NOW, BEFORE I CLOSE ON

02:39:15.579 --> 02:39:17.314
THE FLIP SIDE OF THIS, THE BILL

02:39:17.381 --> 02:39:18.649
ALSO REQUIRES, FOR THE FIRST

02:39:18.715 --> 02:39:20.651
TIME EVER, THE UNIVERSITY TO

02:39:20.717 --> 02:39:21.985
PARTICIPATE IN THOSE PLANS. I

02:39:22.052 --> 02:39:23.854
CHAIRED I'VE CHAIRED FIVE

02:39:23.921 --> 02:39:25.455
SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PLANS.

02:39:25.522 --> 02:39:26.056
THEY'RE DONE EVERY FIVE YEARS.

02:39:26.123 --> 02:39:28.125
SO YOU CAN KNOW HOW LONG I WAS

02:39:28.191 --> 02:39:29.626
MAYOR IN MY OWN CITY. I'VE

02:39:29.693 --> 02:39:31.295
CHAIRED FIVE OF THEM, AND AT

02:39:31.361 --> 02:39:32.429
EACH TIME THERE'S NO SHADE ON MY

02:39:32.496 --> 02:39:34.731
ON ONE OF MY HOME CAMPUSES. BUT

02:39:34.798 --> 02:39:36.066
THE UC DAVIS WOULD SEND THEIR

02:39:36.133 --> 02:39:37.534
DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS TO

02:39:37.601 --> 02:39:39.002
THE OPENING TO THE LAUNCH OF THE

02:39:39.069 --> 02:39:40.637
PLANNING PROCESS FOR THE FOR THE

02:39:40.704 --> 02:39:41.438
REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION AND

02:39:41.505 --> 02:39:43.273
CLIMATE SYSTEM. AND WE NEVER SAW

02:39:43.340 --> 02:39:46.143
HIM AGAIN UNTIL IT WAS ALL DONE

02:39:46.209 --> 02:39:47.044
AT THE UNIVERSITY. SYSTEMS HAVE

02:39:47.110 --> 02:39:49.613
NOT UNIFORMLY PARTICIPATED FOR

02:39:49.680 --> 02:39:51.415
REAL IN THOSE REGIONAL

02:39:51.481 --> 02:39:52.582
SUSTAINABILITY AND CLIMATE AND

02:39:52.649 --> 02:39:53.183
TRANSPORTATION PLANS, AND THEY

02:39:53.250 --> 02:39:55.052
HAVE NOT ALIGNED THEIR OWN PLANS

02:39:55.118 --> 02:39:56.920
TO MATCH THEM. THIS BILL SAYS

02:39:56.987 --> 02:39:58.722
YOU MUST PARTICIPATE BOTH IN THE

02:39:58.789 --> 02:40:00.424
DATA, SO THAT ENROLLMENT CAN BE

02:40:00.490 --> 02:40:01.925
FULLY MODELED AT THE REGIONAL

02:40:01.992 --> 02:40:03.327
SCALE, NOT JUST AS THOUGH EVERY

02:40:03.393 --> 02:40:04.661
STUDENT IS GOING TO LIVE IN LA

02:40:04.728 --> 02:40:06.530
JOLLA BECAUSE THEY WON'T, BUT IN

02:40:06.596 --> 02:40:08.332
THE SAN DIEGO REGION. NUMBER

02:40:08.398 --> 02:40:09.733
ONE. SO THE DATA AND THEN NUMBER

02:40:09.800 --> 02:40:11.335
TWO, YOUR PROJECTS, IN ORDER TO

02:40:11.401 --> 02:40:12.369
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SB 46, WILL

02:40:12.436 --> 02:40:14.504
HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE

02:40:14.571 --> 02:40:15.205
SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PLAN

02:40:15.272 --> 02:40:16.473
THAT ALL OF THE REGION'S LOCAL

02:40:16.540 --> 02:40:18.008
GOVERNMENTS AND MPO AGREE TO. SO

02:40:18.075 --> 02:40:19.910
THAT'S THAT'S THE BILL IN A

02:40:19.977 --> 02:40:21.311
NUTSHELL, AND I APPRECIATE THAT.

02:40:21.378 --> 02:40:22.879
WE'VE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE

02:40:22.946 --> 02:40:23.947
COMMITTEE TO TRY TO TRY TO

02:40:24.014 --> 02:40:25.449
CONTINUE TO IMPROVE IT, REFINE

02:40:25.515 --> 02:40:26.550
AND MAKE SURE THAT IT

02:40:26.616 --> 02:40:28.285
ACCOMPLISHES WHAT IT DOES, WHILE

02:40:28.352 --> 02:40:29.419
ALSO NOT OPENING UP A WHOLE LOT

02:40:29.486 --> 02:40:31.521
OF CHEESE. BUT APPRECIATE THE

02:40:31.588 --> 02:40:32.155
COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION WOULD

02:40:32.222 --> 02:40:34.191
ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU

02:40:34.257 --> 02:40:36.193
SENATOR. I ALSO WANT TO THANK

02:40:36.259 --> 02:40:36.827
MR. MURATSUCHI FOR OPENING UP

02:40:36.893 --> 02:40:41.098
THE COMMITTEE TODAY. I THINK I

02:40:41.164 --> 02:40:44.201
YEAH, I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GO

02:40:44.267 --> 02:40:45.836
FOR A MINUTE ON THAT TWO MINUTES

02:40:45.902 --> 02:40:48.372
EACH. GOOD AFTERNOON, CHAIR

02:40:48.438 --> 02:40:49.906
BRYANT AND MEMBERS OF THE

02:40:49.973 --> 02:40:51.008
COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS JOSIAH

02:40:51.074 --> 02:40:52.542
BAHARI. I'M THE CHAIR OF THE UC

02:40:52.609 --> 02:40:54.444
GRADUATE AND PROFESSIONAL

02:40:54.511 --> 02:40:55.746
COUNCIL, STUDENT REGENT EMERITUS

02:40:55.812 --> 02:40:58.081
OF THE UC BOARD OF REGENTS, A

02:40:58.148 --> 02:40:59.883
PHD STUDENT AT UC MERCED AND A

02:40:59.950 --> 02:41:01.218
PROUD MEMBER WITH POWER

02:41:01.284 --> 02:41:02.753
CALIFORNIA ACTION, WHERE WE

02:41:02.819 --> 02:41:04.321
ORGANIZE YOUNG PEOPLE IN CENTRAL

02:41:04.388 --> 02:41:06.356
VALLEY WHO ARE IMPACTED BY THE

02:41:06.423 --> 02:41:08.158
STATE'S HOUSING AND EDUCATION

02:41:08.225 --> 02:41:09.493
POLICIES IN A REGION THAT WAS

02:41:09.559 --> 02:41:11.261
ONCE OFFERED PRISONS AS ITS

02:41:11.328 --> 02:41:13.463
PRIMARY ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. UC

02:41:13.530 --> 02:41:16.099
MERCED HAS BROUGHT OVER 2.6

02:41:16.166 --> 02:41:17.834
BILLION IN REGIONAL ECONOMIC

02:41:17.901 --> 02:41:19.403
IMPACT AND EXPANDED ACCESS TO

02:41:19.469 --> 02:41:21.505
HIGHER EDUCATION IN ONE OF

02:41:21.571 --> 02:41:22.506
CALIFORNIA'S MOST

02:41:22.572 --> 02:41:24.408
UNDER-RESOURCED AREAS. BUT

02:41:24.474 --> 02:41:25.709
TODAY, THAT IMPACT IS BEING

02:41:25.776 --> 02:41:26.943
LIMITED BY THE LACK OF

02:41:27.010 --> 02:41:28.278
COORDINATED HOUSING AND

02:41:28.345 --> 02:41:31.214
INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING. BETWEEN

02:41:31.281 --> 02:41:32.616
2017 AND 23, MERCED RENTS ROSE

02:41:32.682 --> 02:41:35.452
MORE THAN 25%, FAR OUTPACING

02:41:35.519 --> 02:41:37.621
LOCAL WAGES. THE RESULT FOR UC

02:41:37.687 --> 02:41:39.723
MERCED STUDENTS WAS PREDICTABLE

02:41:39.790 --> 02:41:41.625
OVERCROWDING, DISPLACEMENT AND

02:41:41.691 --> 02:41:43.360
INTERRUPTED EDUCATION. WE'VE

02:41:43.427 --> 02:41:44.528
ALREADY SEEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

02:41:44.594 --> 02:41:46.263
PLANNING AND GROWTH FALL OUT OF

02:41:46.329 --> 02:41:47.964
SYNC. THE UC BERKELEY ENROLLMENT

02:41:48.031 --> 02:41:50.867
FREEZE IN 22 BLOCKED OVER 3000

02:41:50.934 --> 02:41:52.369
STUDENTS. NOT ALL WAS BECAUSE OF

02:41:52.436 --> 02:41:54.104
THE LACK OF CLASSROOM SPACE, BUT

02:41:54.171 --> 02:41:55.672
BECAUSE SEQUA WAS USED TO

02:41:55.739 --> 02:41:56.840
CHALLENGE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT

02:41:56.907 --> 02:41:58.809
TIED TO ENROLLMENT. RIGHT NOW,

02:41:58.875 --> 02:42:00.377
UC MERCED IS BUILDING A NEW

02:42:00.444 --> 02:42:01.778
MEDICAL EDUCATION CENTER TO

02:42:01.845 --> 02:42:03.814
TRAIN MUCH NEEDED HEALTHCARE

02:42:03.880 --> 02:42:04.915
PROFESSIONALS FOR THE VALLEY.

02:42:04.981 --> 02:42:07.117
BUT IF THE REGION FAILS TO PLAN

02:42:07.184 --> 02:42:08.585
FOR WHAT THOSE STUDENTS WILL

02:42:08.652 --> 02:42:10.387
LIVE, LEARN, AND TRAIN, WE

02:42:10.454 --> 02:42:11.455
JEOPARDIZE THE PIPELINE BEFORE

02:42:11.521 --> 02:42:14.291
IT EVEN BEGINS. SB 486 MAKES

02:42:14.357 --> 02:42:15.692
SCENARIOS LIKE THIS AVOIDABLE.

02:42:15.759 --> 02:42:17.928
OUR PUBLIC UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS

02:42:17.994 --> 02:42:20.397
ARE STATE DIRECTED. ENGINES OF

02:42:20.464 --> 02:42:21.865
GROWTH FOR THE COMMUNITIES ARE

02:42:21.932 --> 02:42:23.700
IN. STUDENTS DON'T JUST ATTEND

02:42:23.767 --> 02:42:25.802
THE SCHOOL, IT'S WHERE THEY

02:42:25.869 --> 02:42:27.337
BEGIN THEIR FUTURE. YET THEY'RE

02:42:27.404 --> 02:42:28.738
EXCLUDED FROM THE VERY PLANNING

02:42:28.805 --> 02:42:30.140
PROCESS THAT DETERMINES WHERE

02:42:30.207 --> 02:42:31.508
HOUSING, TRANSIT AND SERVICES

02:42:31.575 --> 02:42:33.276
WILL BE. THAT DISCONNECT WEAKENS

02:42:33.343 --> 02:42:34.878
OUR ABILITY TO MEET THE STATE'S

02:42:34.945 --> 02:42:36.513
CLIMATE, HOUSING, HEALTHCARE AND

02:42:36.580 --> 02:42:38.081
EDUCATION GOALS. WE CANNOT KEEP

02:42:38.148 --> 02:42:40.183
TREATING STUDENT POPULATIONS AS

02:42:40.250 --> 02:42:41.985
INVISIBLE IN REGIONAL PLANS.

02:42:42.052 --> 02:42:43.453
ENROLLMENT GROWTH IS REAL,

02:42:43.520 --> 02:42:44.721
STUDENT HOUSING NEEDS ARE REAL,

02:42:44.788 --> 02:42:46.423
AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF DELAYING

02:42:46.490 --> 02:42:47.757
ARE REAL. FOR THIS REASON, I

02:42:47.824 --> 02:42:50.827
URGE YOU TO VOTE HERE. AYE. VOTE

02:42:50.894 --> 02:42:54.097
ON SB 486. THANK YOU, THANK YOU,

02:42:54.164 --> 02:42:56.199
AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE,

02:42:56.266 --> 02:42:57.567
MR. CHAIR. AND MEMBERS, MICHAEL,

02:42:57.634 --> 02:42:58.502
FOR A PUBLIC POLICY THINK TANK

02:42:58.568 --> 02:43:00.437
IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA,

02:43:00.504 --> 02:43:02.339
SB 46 IS A TARGETED AND

02:43:02.405 --> 02:43:03.640
PRACTICAL PLANNING BILL THAT

02:43:03.707 --> 02:43:05.242
WILL HELP TO INTEGRATE PUBLIC,

02:43:05.308 --> 02:43:06.576
UNIVERSITY AND REGIONAL PLANNING

02:43:06.643 --> 02:43:07.777
EFFORTS AND INCREASE

02:43:07.844 --> 02:43:08.845
COORDINATION TO ACCOMMODATE

02:43:08.912 --> 02:43:10.981
STUDENT ENROLLMENT. DELIBERATE

02:43:11.047 --> 02:43:13.016
INCLUSION OF DETAILED UNIVERSITY

02:43:13.083 --> 02:43:14.417
ENROLLMENT FORECASTING IN THE

02:43:14.484 --> 02:43:15.952
REGIONAL SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY

02:43:16.019 --> 02:43:17.521
STRATEGIES WILL HELP PLAN FOR

02:43:17.587 --> 02:43:18.755
REGIONAL HOUSING AND

02:43:18.822 --> 02:43:20.490
TRANSPORTATION DEMAND. CAMPUS

02:43:20.557 --> 02:43:21.825
RELATED PLANS AND PROJECTS WOULD

02:43:21.892 --> 02:43:22.826
STILL BE SUBJECT TO

02:43:22.893 --> 02:43:24.227
ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW, AND A

02:43:24.294 --> 02:43:25.295
RANGE OF ALTERNATIVES WOULD

02:43:25.362 --> 02:43:26.863
STILL BE CONSIDERED. IN THIS

02:43:26.930 --> 02:43:27.531
PROCESS, WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST

02:43:27.597 --> 02:43:30.767
A VOTE. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING

02:43:30.834 --> 02:43:33.904
ABOUT. ANY PERSONS IN THIS

02:43:33.970 --> 02:43:35.639
HEARING ROOM WHO WOULD LIKE TO

02:43:35.705 --> 02:43:39.943
BE HEARD ON THIS MEASURE. YOU

02:43:40.010 --> 02:43:43.914
COMING? YEAH. OPPOSITION. COME

02:43:43.980 --> 02:43:53.557
ON DOWN. THANK YOU. TWO MINUTES.

02:43:53.623 --> 02:43:57.027
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. GOOD

02:43:57.093 --> 02:43:58.762
AFTERNOON, CHAIR AND ASSEMBLY

02:43:58.828 --> 02:44:00.130
MEMBERS, MATTHEW BAKER WITH

02:44:00.197 --> 02:44:02.699
PLANNING AND CONSERVATION LEAGUE

02:44:02.766 --> 02:44:04.801
PCL. AND I PERSONALLY HAVE GREAT

02:44:04.868 --> 02:44:05.902
RESPECT FOR THE SENATOR AND HIS

02:44:05.969 --> 02:44:07.404
WORK IN THIS AREA AND OTHERS.

02:44:07.470 --> 02:44:09.739
BUT IT PAINS ME THEN TO HAVE TO

02:44:09.806 --> 02:44:11.441
BE HERE TODAY TO TRY TO ARGUE TO

02:44:11.508 --> 02:44:13.476
YOU THAT PART OF THIS BILL WE

02:44:13.543 --> 02:44:14.911
THINK IS A BIG MISTAKE, AND

02:44:14.978 --> 02:44:16.947
WE'LL HAVE CONSEQUENCES

02:44:17.013 --> 02:44:19.916
UNINTENDED BY THE SENATOR. FIRST

02:44:19.983 --> 02:44:22.419
OF ALL, WE TOTALLY SUPPORT THE

02:44:22.485 --> 02:44:23.954
PROVISIONS THAT WOULD

02:44:24.020 --> 02:44:26.223
ACCOMMODATE MORE COMPREHENSIVELY

02:44:26.289 --> 02:44:27.290
STUDENT ENROLLMENT CHANGES IN

02:44:27.357 --> 02:44:29.192
THE LAND USE FORECAST. WE THINK

02:44:29.259 --> 02:44:32.262
THAT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA, BUT WE

02:44:32.329 --> 02:44:34.798
DON'T UNDERSTAND THE ASSOCIATION

02:44:34.864 --> 02:44:36.533
WITH THE PROVISIONS WHERE THAT

02:44:36.600 --> 02:44:39.336
WOULD THEN ALLOW THE UNIVERSITY

02:44:39.402 --> 02:44:42.539
TO NOT HAVE TO CONDUCT A NO

02:44:42.606 --> 02:44:44.207
PROJECT ALTERNATIVE ANALYSIS FOR

02:44:44.274 --> 02:44:45.709
THE LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN.

02:44:45.775 --> 02:44:46.943
WE HAVE GREAT CONCERNS WITH

02:44:47.010 --> 02:44:48.745
THAT. WE APPRECIATE THE

02:44:48.812 --> 02:44:50.113
COMMITTEE'S ATTENTION TO THAT

02:44:50.180 --> 02:44:52.382
CONCERN. I'M STILL REALLY

02:44:52.449 --> 02:44:55.785
UNCLEAR WHERE NEGOTIATIONS ABOUT

02:44:55.852 --> 02:44:58.888
THAT LANGUAGE ARE RIGHT NOW, AND

02:44:58.955 --> 02:45:00.257
IF THERE ARE ONGOING

02:45:00.323 --> 02:45:01.491
NEGOTIATIONS ABOUT WHAT A

02:45:01.558 --> 02:45:03.193
POTENTIAL AMENDMENT COULD BE, I

02:45:03.260 --> 02:45:04.661
HOPE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO BE A

02:45:04.728 --> 02:45:07.530
PART OF THAT. BUT I WANT TO MAKE

02:45:07.597 --> 02:45:09.232
CLEAR THAT WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE

02:45:09.299 --> 02:45:09.899
TO REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION UNLESS

02:45:09.966 --> 02:45:12.736
IT WAS CLEARLY MADE CLEAR THAT

02:45:12.802 --> 02:45:14.004
THE LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN

02:45:14.070 --> 02:45:16.573
IS STILL OBLIGED TO DO THE NO

02:45:16.640 --> 02:45:17.941
PROJECT ALTERNATIVE ANALYSIS.

02:45:18.008 --> 02:45:18.975
AND THE REASON WHY THAT'S

02:45:19.042 --> 02:45:20.176
IMPORTANT. YOU HAVE TO

02:45:20.243 --> 02:45:22.145
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE NO PROJECT

02:45:22.212 --> 02:45:23.446
ANALYSIS REALLY IS, AND I DON'T

02:45:23.513 --> 02:45:25.482
THINK IT WAS QUITE CHARACTERIZED

02:45:25.548 --> 02:45:27.217
CORRECTLY HERE. THE NO PROJECT

02:45:27.284 --> 02:45:28.585
ISN'T TO SAY, OH, WHAT IF WE

02:45:28.652 --> 02:45:31.655
DON'T ADD STUDENTS? OR WHAT IF

02:45:31.721 --> 02:45:32.856
WE JUST DON'T BUILD ANYTHING?

02:45:32.922 --> 02:45:34.824
THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE ANY

02:45:34.891 --> 02:45:37.294
ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS. RATHER,

02:45:37.360 --> 02:45:39.062
THE REALITY IS THAT THE STUDENT

02:45:39.129 --> 02:45:41.665
BODY IS GROWING AND YOU HAVE TO

02:45:41.731 --> 02:45:44.801
MEASURE THE EFFECTS OF NOT

02:45:44.868 --> 02:45:47.370
BUILDING IN LIGHT OF A GROWING

02:45:47.437 --> 02:45:50.373
STUDENT BODY OR OTHER CHANGES.

02:45:50.440 --> 02:45:52.409
SO IF YOU HAVE A GROWING STUDENT

02:45:52.475 --> 02:45:54.711
BODY, WHAT IS THE EFFECTS ON THE

02:45:54.778 --> 02:45:56.079
FUNCTIONING OF UNIVERSITY OR THE

02:45:56.146 --> 02:45:57.280
COMMUNITY? IF WE DON'T ADD

02:45:57.347 --> 02:45:59.949
DINING OR PARKING OR PROVIDE

02:46:00.016 --> 02:46:03.486
MORE TRANSIT TO CAMPUS OR

02:46:03.553 --> 02:46:04.888
IMPORTANTLY, HOUSING, WHAT ARE

02:46:04.954 --> 02:46:06.723
THE EFFECTS? WE HAVE A GROWING

02:46:06.790 --> 02:46:08.591
STUDENT BODY. IF WE DON'T BUILD

02:46:08.658 --> 02:46:09.893
MORE HOUSING ON THE SURROUNDING

02:46:09.959 --> 02:46:11.394
COMMUNITY, WHAT ARE THE HOUSING

02:46:11.461 --> 02:46:13.363
STRESSORS? WHAT ARE THE

02:46:13.430 --> 02:46:14.664
DISPLACEMENT PRESSURES THAT

02:46:14.731 --> 02:46:16.333
YOU'RE INFLICTING? WHAT WHAT ARE

02:46:16.399 --> 02:46:18.068
THOSE IMPACTS ON THE COMMUNITY?

02:46:18.134 --> 02:46:19.469
THE NØ PROJECT ANALYSIS IS WHERE

02:46:19.536 --> 02:46:21.738
YOU MEASURE THOSE THINGS. AND IF

02:46:21.805 --> 02:46:23.640
YOU REMOVE THE UNIVERSITY'S

02:46:23.707 --> 02:46:26.109
OBLIGATION TO DO THAT

02:46:26.176 --> 02:46:27.544
ACCOUNTING, YOU'RE REALLY TAKING

02:46:27.610 --> 02:46:29.813
THEM OFF THE HOOK FOR TAKING

02:46:29.879 --> 02:46:30.447
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THOSE

02:46:30.513 --> 02:46:32.282
IMPACTS. AND WE THINK THAT IS

02:46:32.349 --> 02:46:34.384
JUST SHEDDING THE RESPONSIBILITY

02:46:34.451 --> 02:46:36.686
TO BUILD THAT HOUSING ON THE

02:46:36.753 --> 02:46:37.754
SURROUNDING JURISDICTIONS. AND

02:46:37.821 --> 02:46:39.456
WE THINK THAT THIS MEASURE WOULD

02:46:39.522 --> 02:46:40.523
ULTIMATELY RESULT IN LESS

02:46:40.590 --> 02:46:43.059
HOUSING, NOT MORE SO FOR THE

02:46:43.126 --> 02:46:45.195
BILL THAT'S BEFORE YOU TODAY,

02:46:45.261 --> 02:46:46.396
VERY RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO

02:46:46.463 --> 02:46:50.133
VOTE. WE WERE GENEROUS WITH

02:46:50.200 --> 02:46:53.803
THREE MINUTES. ANY PERSONS IN

02:46:53.870 --> 02:46:57.841
THE HEARING ROOM IN OPPOSITION?

02:46:57.907 --> 02:46:59.376
SEEING NONE BEFORE WE TURN IT

02:46:59.442 --> 02:47:00.944
AND OPEN IT UP TO COMMITTEE

02:47:01.010 --> 02:47:02.679
MEMBERS. THE SENATOR AND I HAVE

02:47:02.746 --> 02:47:04.214
BEEN TALKING ALL THROUGH THE

02:47:04.280 --> 02:47:05.382
WEEKEND AND ALL THROUGH TODAY,

02:47:05.448 --> 02:47:07.183
INCLUDING A ONE ON ONE SESSION

02:47:07.250 --> 02:47:08.718
WITH LAWRENCE THROUGHOUT THE DAY

02:47:08.785 --> 02:47:10.820
TO SEE IF WE COULD LAND THIS

02:47:10.887 --> 02:47:13.356
PLANE IN TIME FOR THIS HEARING

02:47:13.423 --> 02:47:15.425
OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE

02:47:15.492 --> 02:47:15.925
WRITTEN IN THE COMMITTEE

02:47:15.992 --> 02:47:16.459
ANALYSIS THE SENATOR, AND

02:47:16.526 --> 02:47:17.527
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, SENATOR

02:47:17.594 --> 02:47:19.562
IS ACCEPTING AMENDMENTS ONE AND

02:47:19.629 --> 02:47:24.667
TWO. WE ARE WORKING THROUGH. THE

02:47:24.734 --> 02:47:27.103
FINAL AMENDMENT, AND I APOLOGIZE

02:47:27.170 --> 02:47:27.704
FOR THAT. COMMITTEE MEMBERS,

02:47:27.771 --> 02:47:29.739
WE'VE GOT SOME DRAFT LANGUAGE

02:47:29.806 --> 02:47:30.507
THAT I BELIEVE ALL OF YOU HAVE

02:47:30.573 --> 02:47:33.543
JUST BEEN SENT. BUT EVEN IN

02:47:33.610 --> 02:47:35.979
THAT, I DON'T BELIEVE IN THE

02:47:36.045 --> 02:47:37.380
SENATOR, AND I DON'T BELIEVE

02:47:37.447 --> 02:47:39.949
THAT WE'VE KIND OF REACHED A

02:47:40.016 --> 02:47:40.784
FINAL SPOT YET, BUT THE SENATOR

02:47:40.850 --> 02:47:42.185
HAS BEEN WORKING IN TREMENDOUS

02:47:42.252 --> 02:47:44.053
GOOD FAITH, AND I BELIEVE COMES

02:47:44.120 --> 02:47:45.388
FROM A VERY RIGHTEOUS PLACE. AND

02:47:45.455 --> 02:47:46.856
I THINK THAT WE CAN CONTINUE

02:47:46.923 --> 02:47:48.191
THIS CONVERSATION GOING INTO THE

02:47:48.258 --> 02:47:49.259
APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE AND GET

02:47:49.325 --> 02:47:51.227
SOMEWHERE THAT MAKES SENSE TO

02:47:51.294 --> 02:47:52.996
TRY TO ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS

02:47:53.062 --> 02:47:54.998
AND RESPECTS THE TRUE INTENTS OF

02:47:55.064 --> 02:47:56.699
THE BILL. SO I KNOW I'VE TALKED

02:47:56.766 --> 02:47:58.435
TO MANY OF YOU ABOUT THAT, BUT I

02:47:58.501 --> 02:48:00.970
JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT

02:48:01.037 --> 02:48:02.505
BEFORE I OPEN IT BACK UP TO

02:48:02.572 --> 02:48:03.940
CONVERSATION FROM OTHER MEMBERS.

02:48:04.007 --> 02:48:04.507
ANY QUESTIONS? COMMENTS. MR.

02:48:04.574 --> 02:48:06.109
BURR, THE MEMBER FROM WESTWOOD

02:48:06.176 --> 02:48:06.976
REPRESENTING THE NUMBER ONE

02:48:07.043 --> 02:48:10.580
PUBLIC UNIVERSITY IN CALIFORNIA.

02:48:10.647 --> 02:48:15.652
WHAT WOULD THAT BE? I. SO I

02:48:15.718 --> 02:48:17.454
DON'T ACTUALLY THINK THAT

02:48:17.520 --> 02:48:18.822
ELIMINATING THE NO PROJECT

02:48:18.888 --> 02:48:19.956
ALTERNATIVE IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE

02:48:20.023 --> 02:48:22.192
IS ALL THAT BAD A THING, BECAUSE

02:48:22.258 --> 02:48:24.294
IN EVERY CASE UNDER SEQUA, YOU

02:48:24.360 --> 02:48:28.231
STILL HAVE TO ANALYZE THE

02:48:28.298 --> 02:48:30.233
IMPACTS COMPARED TO THE EXISTING

02:48:30.300 --> 02:48:33.937
CONDITION ON THE CAMPUS. AND

02:48:34.003 --> 02:48:35.772
TYPICALLY WHAT WOULD END UP

02:48:35.839 --> 02:48:37.674
HAPPENING IN ALL THESE CASES

02:48:37.740 --> 02:48:39.476
WOULD BE THAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE

02:48:39.542 --> 02:48:42.045
A PAPER ANALYSIS OF A NO PROJECT

02:48:42.111 --> 02:48:43.580
ALTERNATIVE, AND THEN BASICALLY

02:48:43.646 --> 02:48:45.615
IT DOESN'T MEET THE PROJECT

02:48:45.682 --> 02:48:47.050
OBJECTIVES, WHICH WOULD BE TO

02:48:47.116 --> 02:48:47.917
ACCOMMODATE MORE STUDENTS. AND

02:48:47.984 --> 02:48:50.220
SO YOU'RE BASICALLY REQUIRING

02:48:50.286 --> 02:48:52.055
THE UNIVERSITY TO GO THROUGH

02:48:52.121 --> 02:48:57.994
THIS PAPER EXERCISE WHERE. WHERE

02:48:58.061 --> 02:48:59.162
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT

02:48:59.229 --> 02:49:01.264
THEY'RE EVER GOING TO DO BECAUSE

02:49:01.331 --> 02:49:03.132
IT WOULD JUST BE REJECTED BASED

02:49:03.199 --> 02:49:04.934
ON NOT MEETING THE PROJECT

02:49:05.001 --> 02:49:06.703
ALTERNATIVE. SO HELP ME

02:49:06.769 --> 02:49:08.571
UNDERSTAND WHY THAT'S SUCH A BAD

02:49:08.638 --> 02:49:10.106
THING. I JUST DON'T SEE WHERE

02:49:10.173 --> 02:49:12.408
THE BEEF IS, I GUESS. WELL,

02:49:12.475 --> 02:49:14.677
WELL, I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION.

02:49:14.744 --> 02:49:17.247
IT'S DIFFERENT BETWEEN A

02:49:17.313 --> 02:49:19.449
SPECIFIC PROJECT, LIKE, SAY

02:49:19.516 --> 02:49:20.750
YOU'RE PROPOSING A HOUSING

02:49:20.817 --> 02:49:22.652
PROJECT AND THE, THE OVERALL

02:49:22.719 --> 02:49:24.020
LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN FOR

02:49:24.087 --> 02:49:26.523
THE ENTIRE CAMPUS. SO LIKE SO

02:49:26.589 --> 02:49:28.992
YEAH, IF YOU'RE PROPOSING A

02:49:29.058 --> 02:49:31.261
HOUSING PROJECT THEN IT'S YOU

02:49:31.327 --> 02:49:33.162
KNOW, YEAH, WE'RE TRYING TO

02:49:33.229 --> 02:49:34.597
BUILD A HOUSING PROJECT. SO LIKE

02:49:34.664 --> 02:49:36.666
THE NO PROJECT ALTERNATIVE ISN'T

02:49:36.733 --> 02:49:40.603
NECESSARILY LIKE A REAL VALUABLE

02:49:40.670 --> 02:49:42.071
EXERCISE THERE. I GUESS I WOULD

02:49:42.138 --> 02:49:43.373
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. BUT FOR THE

02:49:43.439 --> 02:49:45.742
LONG RANGE PLAN, WHERE YOU HAVE

02:49:45.808 --> 02:49:47.110
AN OVERALL GROWING STUDENT BODY

02:49:47.176 --> 02:49:48.912
AND AN OVERALL NEED FOR

02:49:48.978 --> 02:49:50.313
FACILITIES AND HOUSING, YOU

02:49:50.380 --> 02:49:52.081
KNOW, IF YOU'RE NOT BUILDING

02:49:52.148 --> 02:49:53.516
THAT IN YOUR LONG RANGE INTO

02:49:53.583 --> 02:49:55.785
YOUR LONG RANGE PLANNING IT, YOU

02:49:55.852 --> 02:49:59.589
KNOW, THE NO PROJECT ALTERNATIVE

02:49:59.656 --> 02:50:01.891
ANALYSIS IS WHERE YOU MEASURE

02:50:01.958 --> 02:50:05.395
THE EFFECTS ON THE. THE, YOU

02:50:05.461 --> 02:50:08.097
KNOW, LONG PLANS OF THE OF

02:50:08.164 --> 02:50:09.599
THE CAMPUS AND ON THE COMMUNITY

02:50:09.666 --> 02:50:11.968
AROUND IT. HOW TO EXPLAIN IT.

02:50:12.035 --> 02:50:13.770
YEAH, I GUESS I GUESS I WOULD

02:50:13.836 --> 02:50:14.704
UNDERSTAND IF YOU WERE TALKING

02:50:14.771 --> 02:50:16.606
ABOUT A MUNICIPALITY WHERE YOU

02:50:16.673 --> 02:50:19.075
ACTUALLY HAVE SORT OF INDIGENOUS

02:50:19.142 --> 02:50:22.011
POPULATION GROWTH AND, YOU KNOW,

02:50:22.078 --> 02:50:24.180
THE CITY OF SANTA MONICA IS

02:50:24.247 --> 02:50:26.616
GROWING. RIGHT. AND BUT THIS IS

02:50:26.683 --> 02:50:28.451
IN SOME CASE WHERE YOUR LONG

02:50:28.518 --> 02:50:30.653
RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN IS ABOUT

02:50:30.720 --> 02:50:31.621
SORT OF ENROLLMENT THAT THE

02:50:31.688 --> 02:50:33.923
UNIVERSITY HAS CONTROL OVER. AND

02:50:33.990 --> 02:50:38.227
YOU REALLY, YOU KNOW, CAN I GIVE

02:50:38.294 --> 02:50:40.330
YOU AN ANECDOTAL EXAMPLE? IF YOU

02:50:40.396 --> 02:50:41.631
LOOK RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO,

02:50:41.698 --> 02:50:43.333
WE HAD A BIG A VERY LARGE

02:50:43.399 --> 02:50:44.934
EXPANSION THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT

02:50:45.001 --> 02:50:47.470
NOW ON THE UC DAVIS SACRAMENTO

02:50:47.537 --> 02:50:48.638
CAMPUS, AGGIE SQUARE PROJECT

02:50:48.705 --> 02:50:50.440
THAT MAYBE YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT

02:50:50.506 --> 02:50:53.343
EXPANDING THE CAMPUS BY THE

02:50:53.409 --> 02:50:55.044
CAMPUS POPULATION BY 5000

02:50:55.111 --> 02:50:58.047
STUDENTS AND PROFESSORS AND

02:50:58.114 --> 02:50:59.816
PROFESSIONAL RESEARCHERS AND

02:50:59.882 --> 02:51:03.419
STUFF IN THE MIDDLE OF A

02:51:03.486 --> 02:51:04.120
HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED,

02:51:04.187 --> 02:51:06.656
RAPIDLY GENTRIFYING COMMUNITY OF

02:51:06.723 --> 02:51:09.192
OAK PARK. EVERYBODY WANTED THE

02:51:09.258 --> 02:51:11.861
PROJECT. BUT WITH THAT 5000,

02:51:11.928 --> 02:51:13.796
THAT THAT GROWTH OF 5000 IN THE

02:51:13.863 --> 02:51:15.264
CAMPUS POPULATION, THEY WERE

02:51:15.331 --> 02:51:17.467
ONLY PROPOSING TO BUILD 150

02:51:17.533 --> 02:51:19.535
UNITS. AND SO THE COMMUNITY

02:51:19.602 --> 02:51:21.371
PROTESTED THAT AND SAID, YOU

02:51:21.437 --> 02:51:24.340
NEED TO ACCOMMODATE MITIGATION

02:51:24.407 --> 02:51:25.675
OF THE HOUSING STRESS THAT

02:51:25.742 --> 02:51:27.910
YOU'RE PUTTING ON THE COMMUNITY

02:51:27.977 --> 02:51:30.313
AND BUILD MORE HOUSING. AND SO,

02:51:30.380 --> 02:51:32.115
LIKE THE NO PROJECT ALTERNATIVE

02:51:32.181 --> 02:51:35.385
IS WHERE YOU WE HAD A DISCUSSION

02:51:35.451 --> 02:51:38.721
ABOUT THAT AND, YOU KNOW, IT

02:51:38.788 --> 02:51:40.456
ENDED UP, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS

02:51:40.523 --> 02:51:41.557
LITIGATION, BUT IT WAS SETTLED

02:51:41.624 --> 02:51:43.459
AND THERE WAS ENDED IN A VERY

02:51:43.526 --> 02:51:45.395
GOOD COMMUNITY BENEFITS

02:51:45.461 --> 02:51:47.096
AGREEMENT, WHICH RESULTED IN

02:51:47.163 --> 02:51:48.798
FUNDING GOING TO MORE AFFORDABLE

02:51:48.865 --> 02:51:49.966
HOUSING AND LOCAL HIRE, A WHOLE

02:51:50.033 --> 02:51:51.534
BUNCH OF GOOD STUFF THAT CAME

02:51:51.601 --> 02:51:54.504
OUT OF THAT. BUT THE NO PROJECT

02:51:54.570 --> 02:51:56.639
ALTERNATIVE ANALYSIS IS WHERE

02:51:56.706 --> 02:51:59.942
THE UNIVERSITY SHOULD BE HELD TO

02:52:00.009 --> 02:52:01.577
ACCOUNT FOR WHAT THOSE IMPACTS

02:52:01.644 --> 02:52:02.779
ARE IN THE COMMUNITY. IF THEY'RE

02:52:02.845 --> 02:52:04.547
NOT BUILDING ENOUGH HOUSING,

02:52:04.614 --> 02:52:07.183
DOES THAT SORT OF ILLUSTRATE

02:52:07.250 --> 02:52:08.217
UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE NOT

02:52:08.284 --> 02:52:09.986
GETTING TO THAT BY LOOKING AT

02:52:10.053 --> 02:52:12.455
THE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS COMPARED

02:52:12.522 --> 02:52:13.690
TO THE EXISTING CONDITIONS? IT

02:52:13.756 --> 02:52:15.425
JUST SEEMS LIKE THAT WOULD

02:52:15.491 --> 02:52:17.493
HAPPEN AS PART OF THE DOCUMENT

02:52:17.560 --> 02:52:19.095
ANYWAY, AND YOU'RE JUST

02:52:19.162 --> 02:52:20.029
BASICALLY REQUIRING THE

02:52:20.096 --> 02:52:21.998
UNIVERSITY TO GO THROUGH A LOT

02:52:22.065 --> 02:52:23.266
OF ANALYSIS, WHICH IS NOT A

02:52:23.332 --> 02:52:25.168
WHOLE LOT DIFFERENT THAN

02:52:25.234 --> 02:52:26.469
ACTUALLY ANALYZING THE PROJECT

02:52:26.536 --> 02:52:27.270
AGAINST EXISTING CONDITIONS.

02:52:27.336 --> 02:52:29.072
WELL, THE NO PROJECT ANALYSIS IS

02:52:29.138 --> 02:52:31.607
THE IS THE COMPARISON FOR WHAT

02:52:31.674 --> 02:52:33.376
THE PROJECT IS PROPOSING TO DO

02:52:33.443 --> 02:52:36.646
WITH WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU

02:52:36.713 --> 02:52:38.548
DIDN'T DO THE PROJECT. I MEAN,

02:52:38.614 --> 02:52:40.183
THAT'S WHAT THE NEW PROJECT

02:52:40.249 --> 02:52:40.850
ANALYSIS IS. YOU HAVE TO

02:52:40.917 --> 02:52:43.386
MEASURE. YOU STILL HAVE TO. HE'S

02:52:43.453 --> 02:52:44.620
NOT I DON'T THINK THE BILL IS

02:52:44.687 --> 02:52:45.922
REQUIRED IS CHANGING THE OTHER

02:52:45.988 --> 02:52:48.157
PROVISIONS OF SEQUA. RIGHT. SO

02:52:48.224 --> 02:52:49.592
BASICALLY THE REQUIREMENTS OF

02:52:49.659 --> 02:52:52.762
SEQUA IS THAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE

02:52:52.829 --> 02:52:54.997
TO COMPARE YOUR PROJECT AND ALL

02:52:55.064 --> 02:52:56.165
THE ALTERNATIVES, A REASONABLE

02:52:56.232 --> 02:52:58.534
RANGE OF ALTERNATIVES AGAINST

02:52:58.601 --> 02:53:00.803
THE EXISTING CONDITIONS. AND SO

02:53:00.870 --> 02:53:02.739
I DON'T SORT OF SEE THE

02:53:02.805 --> 02:53:03.606
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT THE NO

02:53:03.673 --> 02:53:05.074
PROJECT ALTERNATIVE IS AND THE

02:53:05.141 --> 02:53:06.976
EXISTING CONDITIONS, BUT THAT IS

02:53:07.043 --> 02:53:08.177
THE NO PROJECT ALTERNATIVE. I

02:53:08.244 --> 02:53:09.412
MEAN, THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT

02:53:09.479 --> 02:53:10.446
YOU'RE DESCRIBING. THAT'S WHAT

02:53:10.513 --> 02:53:12.215
THE NO PROJECT ALTERNATIVE

02:53:12.281 --> 02:53:13.549
ANALYSIS DOES. SO IF YOU TAKE

02:53:13.616 --> 02:53:15.451
THAT AWAY, THEN YOU ARE TAKING

02:53:15.518 --> 02:53:16.853
AWAY A SORT OF FUNDAMENTAL TENET

02:53:16.919 --> 02:53:18.421
OF CEQA WHERE YOU COMPARE THE

02:53:18.488 --> 02:53:19.822
EFFECTS OF YOUR PROJECT AGAINST

02:53:19.889 --> 02:53:21.724
THE EFFECTS OF NOT HAVING THE

02:53:21.791 --> 02:53:22.925
PROJECT. YEAH, I DON'T WANT TO

02:53:22.992 --> 02:53:24.660
SPEND TOO MUCH TIME AND GO BACK,

02:53:24.727 --> 02:53:27.096
BUT I, I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT

02:53:27.163 --> 02:53:28.798
THE AUTHOR IS INTENDING TO DO. I

02:53:28.865 --> 02:53:31.033
MEAN, YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY

02:53:31.100 --> 02:53:32.568
UNDERTAKE A CEQA ANALYSIS UNLESS

02:53:32.635 --> 02:53:34.737
YOU'RE COMPARING YOUR PROJECT TO

02:53:34.804 --> 02:53:36.038
SOMETHING. AND THE CURRENT LAW

02:53:36.105 --> 02:53:37.874
IS THAT YOU HAVE TO COMPARE IT

02:53:37.940 --> 02:53:38.808
TO EXISTING CONDITIONS. AND OF

02:53:38.875 --> 02:53:40.376
COURSE, THERE'S A LOT OF DEBATE

02:53:40.443 --> 02:53:42.845
ABOUT WHAT THAT MIGHT BE AND

02:53:42.912 --> 02:53:43.513
DIFFERENT KINDS OF PROJECTS, BUT

02:53:43.579 --> 02:53:44.914
I'M STILL UNCLEAR ON WHAT THE

02:53:44.981 --> 02:53:46.783
AUTHOR IS INTENDING TO DO WITH

02:53:46.849 --> 02:53:49.852
THIS. BUT I DON'T. OKAY, WELL,

02:53:49.919 --> 02:53:51.420
ANYWAY, YOU KNOW, I TRUST THAT

02:53:51.487 --> 02:53:55.224
THERE'S SOME SOME. THAT THE

02:53:55.291 --> 02:53:56.192
AUTHOR WILL CONTINUE WORKING

02:53:56.259 --> 02:53:59.796
WITH YOU. I, I DON'T REALLY SEE,

02:53:59.862 --> 02:54:01.531
YOU KNOW, I UNDERSTAND HOW

02:54:01.597 --> 02:54:03.032
IMPORTANT IT IS THAT WE BUILD

02:54:03.099 --> 02:54:05.268
HOUSING. I ACTUALLY CONCUR WITH

02:54:05.334 --> 02:54:07.436
THE SENATOR'S VIEWS THAT WE

02:54:07.503 --> 02:54:08.404
SHOULD BE DOING EVERYTHING WE

02:54:08.471 --> 02:54:11.340
CAN TO EXPAND ENROLLMENT ON OUR

02:54:11.407 --> 02:54:12.742
CAMPUSES. IT IS THE PATH TO

02:54:12.809 --> 02:54:14.977
UPWARD MOBILITY FOR OUR KIDS IN

02:54:15.044 --> 02:54:17.480
THIS STATE AND FOR FAMILIES. AND

02:54:17.547 --> 02:54:20.950
I DO THINK THAT THE EXISTING

02:54:21.017 --> 02:54:25.021
TENETS OF SEQUA, IN COMPARING

02:54:25.087 --> 02:54:27.557
THE IMPACTS OF THE PROJECT AND A

02:54:27.623 --> 02:54:29.725
REASONABLE RANGE OF ALTERNATIVES

02:54:29.792 --> 02:54:31.093
AGAINST THE NO PROJECT

02:54:31.160 --> 02:54:34.263
ALTERNATIVE IS A IS, YOU KNOW,

02:54:34.330 --> 02:54:36.632
WILL RAISE ALL THESE ISSUES

02:54:36.699 --> 02:54:37.667
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND I

02:54:37.733 --> 02:54:40.136
DON'T THINK THAT THE BILL WOULD

02:54:40.203 --> 02:54:42.305
PREVENT THE LEAD AGENCY FROM

02:54:42.371 --> 02:54:44.240
DECIDING TO DO A NO PROJECT

02:54:44.307 --> 02:54:45.975
ALTERNATIVE ON ITS OWN, AS PART

02:54:46.042 --> 02:54:46.676
OF THEIR DETERMINATION OF WHAT

02:54:46.742 --> 02:54:47.777
THE REASONABLE RANGE OF

02:54:47.844 --> 02:54:50.279
ALTERNATIVES ARE, IF THAT IF

02:54:50.346 --> 02:54:52.181
THERE WAS A LOT OF COMMUNITY

02:54:52.248 --> 02:54:53.616
INPUT AS PART OF THE SCOPING OF

02:54:53.683 --> 02:54:55.585
THE EIR. SO ANYWAY, I DON'T WANT

02:54:55.651 --> 02:54:57.420
TO GO BACK AND FORTH BECAUSE I

02:54:57.486 --> 02:54:59.522
KNOW WE'RE OUT OF TIME, BUT I'M

02:54:59.589 --> 02:55:00.289
PREPARED TO SUPPORT THE BILL

02:55:00.356 --> 02:55:01.891
TODAY AND PREPARED TO MOVE IT.

02:55:01.958 --> 02:55:03.025
AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND

02:55:03.092 --> 02:55:04.660
THANK YOU. MR. WORKING WITH THE

02:55:04.727 --> 02:55:06.495
OPPOSITION, I JUST WANT TO THANK

02:55:06.562 --> 02:55:08.898
MY COLLEAGUE FROM WESTWOOD WHO

02:55:08.965 --> 02:55:10.766
REPRESENTS THE NUMBER ONE PUBLIC

02:55:10.833 --> 02:55:13.369
UNIVERSITY IN CALIFORNIA. ANY

02:55:13.436 --> 02:55:17.206
OTHER QUESTIONS, MR. CONLEY?

02:55:17.273 --> 02:55:19.041
THANK YOU, CHAIR. AND I'LL JUST

02:55:19.108 --> 02:55:21.377
NOTE I DID ACTUALLY ATTEND THE

02:55:21.444 --> 02:55:25.114
NUMBER ONE. WHICH HAPPENS TO BE

02:55:25.181 --> 02:55:27.817
IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. BUT

02:55:27.884 --> 02:55:29.819
THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS, MR.

02:55:29.886 --> 02:55:36.425
CONLEY. NØ REALLY APPRECIATE THE

02:55:36.492 --> 02:55:38.895
INTENT SPIRIT HERE. HAD A

02:55:38.961 --> 02:55:40.296
QUESTION. AND THEN I DID WANT TO

02:55:40.363 --> 02:55:42.365
AT LEAST BRIEFLY WEIGH IN ON

02:55:42.431 --> 02:55:44.800
BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE WE HAVE

02:55:44.867 --> 02:55:47.136
NOT RESOLVED THIS ISSUE, WHICH

02:55:47.203 --> 02:55:48.471
BUT THERE WILL BE ONGOING WORK.

02:55:48.537 --> 02:55:51.707
SO THE QUESTION IS HOW ARE,

02:55:51.774 --> 02:55:53.709
QUOTE, PROJECTS THAT ARE

02:55:53.776 --> 02:55:56.145
REQUIRED TO MEET EACH CAMPUS'S

02:55:56.212 --> 02:55:57.446
SHARE OF THE SYSTEM WIDE

02:55:57.513 --> 02:55:59.682
ENROLLMENT, END QUOTE DEFINED?

02:55:59.749 --> 02:56:02.652
HOW WOULD YOU ACTUALLY DEFINE

02:56:02.718 --> 02:56:07.723
THOSE PROJECTS? SO. THESE ARE

02:56:07.790 --> 02:56:11.160
THAT'S A REGIONAL DETERMINATION

02:56:11.227 --> 02:56:13.396
BECAUSE BECAUSE ENROLLMENT AND

02:56:13.462 --> 02:56:16.299
THE ASSIGNMENT OF ENROLLMENT IS

02:56:16.365 --> 02:56:17.700
EXCUSE ME IS A DECISION. THE TOP

02:56:17.767 --> 02:56:20.369
LEVEL IS A IS A JOINT DECISION

02:56:20.436 --> 02:56:21.003
BETWEEN THE REGENTS ESSENTIALLY

02:56:21.070 --> 02:56:21.837
AND THE GOVERNOR AND THE

02:56:21.904 --> 02:56:23.773
LEGISLATURE, BECAUSE WE ALL WE

02:56:23.839 --> 02:56:24.941
PUT THAT IN THE BUDGET DIRECTLY.

02:56:25.007 --> 02:56:26.208
BUT THEN SECONDARILY, IN TERMS

02:56:26.275 --> 02:56:28.177
OF PROJECTS TO MEET THAT MEET

02:56:28.244 --> 02:56:30.146
THOSE TARGET NUMBERS, THOSE ARE

02:56:30.212 --> 02:56:31.514
DETERMINED BY THE BY THE REGENTS

02:56:31.580 --> 02:56:34.550
AND THE PRESIDENT. OKAY. AND

02:56:34.617 --> 02:56:36.285
THEN ON THE NO PROJECT

02:56:36.352 --> 02:56:38.154
ALTERNATIVE, I GUESS, WHERE I

02:56:38.220 --> 02:56:39.689
WAS A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED AS

02:56:39.755 --> 02:56:43.926
WELL, JUST SOMEWHAT GOING TO THE

02:56:43.993 --> 02:56:44.727
OPPOSITION'S POINT. I MEAN,

02:56:44.794 --> 02:56:47.163
USUALLY A NO PROJECT ALTERNATIVE

02:56:47.229 --> 02:56:50.866
ANALYSIS THAT GENERALLY DOESN'T

02:56:50.933 --> 02:56:52.601
NECESSARILY MEAN NOTHING GETS

02:56:52.668 --> 02:56:56.305
DONE. OFTENTIMES THAT ANALYSIS

02:56:56.372 --> 02:56:59.508
SHOWS THAT BY DOING NOTHING,

02:56:59.575 --> 02:57:00.977
THERE IS ACTUALLY MORE

02:57:01.043 --> 02:57:03.412
ENVIRONMENTAL HARM CAUSED. SO IT

02:57:03.479 --> 02:57:07.316
COULD LEAD TO AN ALTERNATIVE

02:57:07.383 --> 02:57:11.120
PROJECT GOING FORWARD. SO I

02:57:11.187 --> 02:57:13.122
GUESS I WOULD LOVE THE FACT IF

02:57:13.189 --> 02:57:15.391
YOU COULD CONTINUE TO WORK WITH

02:57:15.458 --> 02:57:18.160
THE CHAIR, PERHAPS WITH

02:57:18.227 --> 02:57:20.997
OPPOSITION, KIND OF BETTER

02:57:21.063 --> 02:57:23.199
CLARIFY WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

02:57:23.265 --> 02:57:25.434
ACCOMPLISH WITH THAT WITHOUT

02:57:25.501 --> 02:57:28.270
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT

02:57:28.337 --> 02:57:30.539
WOULD BE APPRECIATED. SO

02:57:30.606 --> 02:57:32.675
OVERALL, I'M GOING TO GO UP ON

02:57:32.742 --> 02:57:36.178
IT TODAY WITH THE EXPECTATION

02:57:36.245 --> 02:57:40.082
THERE WILL BE MORE WORK DONE.

02:57:40.149 --> 02:57:40.716
THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. ANY

02:57:40.783 --> 02:57:43.386
OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS?

02:57:43.452 --> 02:57:44.820
SEEING NONE. SENATOR, WOULD YOU

02:57:44.887 --> 02:57:46.288
LIKE TO CLOSE? YEAH. THANK YOU

02:57:46.355 --> 02:57:49.492
SO MUCH, MR. CHAIR. AND MEMBERS

02:57:49.558 --> 02:57:52.495
FOR THE I RECOGNIZE HOW THIS,

02:57:52.561 --> 02:57:54.363
YOU KNOW, HOW CHALLENGING THIS

02:57:54.430 --> 02:57:56.999
CAN BE. AND I AND I DO AND I

02:57:57.066 --> 02:57:59.101
REALLY APPRECIATE THE COLLOQUY

02:57:59.168 --> 02:58:01.003
AS WELL AROUND THIS BECAUSE, YOU

02:58:01.070 --> 02:58:03.539
KNOW, I'VE DONE A THOUSAND YEARS

02:58:03.606 --> 02:58:06.509
AS MAYOR AS WELL. AND FOR THESE,

02:58:06.575 --> 02:58:07.810
FOR THE KINDS OF CASES THAT

02:58:07.877 --> 02:58:09.145
YOU'RE DESCRIBING, WE WOULD WE

02:58:09.211 --> 02:58:10.846
WOULD ALWAYS BE ELECTING TO DO A

02:58:10.913 --> 02:58:12.348
NO PROJECT ALTERNATIVE, EVEN IF

02:58:12.415 --> 02:58:13.649
WE DIDN'T HAVE TO, FOR THE

02:58:13.716 --> 02:58:15.551
REASONS THAT MISTER MISTER BURR

02:58:15.618 --> 02:58:17.119
MENTIONED. IF IT'S LIKE THE

02:58:17.186 --> 02:58:18.454
WORLD CRASHING DOWN, IF WE DON'T

02:58:18.521 --> 02:58:21.624
DO THIS PROJECT AND WE NEED SOME

02:58:21.690 --> 02:58:23.559
WAY TO SAY IT, WE COULD DO A NO

02:58:23.626 --> 02:58:25.494
PROJECT, OR WE COULD JUST PUT IT

02:58:25.561 --> 02:58:27.396
IN THE MAIN ANALYSIS OF THE OF

02:58:27.463 --> 02:58:28.998
THE EIR AS WELL. SO I DO THINK,

02:58:29.065 --> 02:58:30.533
YOU KNOW, WE CAN GET THERE ON

02:58:30.599 --> 02:58:32.435
THAT PIECE. HAVING SAID THAT, I

02:58:32.501 --> 02:58:33.702
REALIZE THE, YOU KNOW, THE

02:58:33.769 --> 02:58:34.804
CONCERN, THE LEGITIMATE CONCERN

02:58:34.870 --> 02:58:35.438
ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF NO

02:58:35.504 --> 02:58:37.773
PROJECT AS THE PATH FORWARD. I

02:58:37.840 --> 02:58:38.574
THINK IT'S, YOU UNDERSTAND, KIND

02:58:38.641 --> 02:58:40.209
OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE,

02:58:40.276 --> 02:58:42.445
WHICH IS TO NOT HAVE NOT, HAVE

02:58:42.511 --> 02:58:43.512
NOT NEITHER HAVE THE

02:58:43.579 --> 02:58:44.914
UNIVERSITIES DO PAPER EXERCISES,

02:58:44.980 --> 02:58:46.148
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, NOT CREATE

02:58:46.215 --> 02:58:48.617
THE BASIS FOR LITIGATION THREATS

02:58:48.684 --> 02:58:50.119
AROUND IS THE NO PROJECT

02:58:50.186 --> 02:58:50.686
ALTERNATIVE, YOU KNOW, GOOD

02:58:50.753 --> 02:58:52.922
ENOUGH AND ALL OF THAT THAT WILL

02:58:52.988 --> 02:58:55.057
THAT WILL BLOCK THE THESE

02:58:55.124 --> 02:58:56.492
CAMPUSES ESPECIALLY THE YOU

02:58:56.559 --> 02:58:58.928
KNOW, THE NUMBER ONE, THE NUMBER

02:58:58.994 --> 02:59:00.629
ONE AND THE NUMBER ONE IN THE

02:59:00.696 --> 02:59:01.664
CENTRAL VALLEY, IN THE IN THE

02:59:01.730 --> 02:59:03.532
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY, FROM BEING

02:59:03.599 --> 02:59:04.667
ABLE TO EXPAND TO MEET THE NEEDS

02:59:04.733 --> 02:59:06.402
THAT WE'RE EXPECTING OF THAT. SO

02:59:06.469 --> 02:59:07.369
I'M ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED AND

02:59:07.436 --> 02:59:08.771
APPRECIATE THE, THE LEADERSHIP

THE RIGHT, THE RIGHT INSTRUMENT

02:59:18.747 --> 02:59:19.482

FORWARD TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS.

02:59:26.388 --> 02:59:28.891
DO WE HAVE A MOTION? WE HAVE A

02:59:28.958 --> 02:59:30.826
MOTION AND A SECOND. AND AS THE

02:59:30.893 --> 02:59:32.728

AT UCLA AND THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE

02:59:39.268 --> 02:59:41.504
NEAR UCLA AND ARE PART OF THAT

VIBRANT COMMUNITY, I SEE WE HAVE

ROOM AS WELL. THEY ARE WATCHING

02:59:46.242 --> 02:59:48.377
THIS KIND OF LEGISLATION,

02:59:48.444 --> 02:59:49.578
LOOKING TO SEE US CONTINUE TO

CONTINUES TO FACE A YEAR ROUND

03:01:27.443 --> 03:01:29.378
FIRE SEASON, IT IS CLEAR THAT WE

03:01:29.445 --> 03:01:31.981
MUST HARDEN CALIFORNIA'S

03:01:32.047 --> 03:01:34.250
DEFENSES AGAINST FUTURE

03:01:34.316 --> 03:01:36.085
DISASTERS. SO THIS BILL DOES

03:01:36.151 --> 03:01:37.453
THREE THINGS. ONE, IT APPLIES

03:01:37.519 --> 03:01:39.888
THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE,

03:01:39.955 --> 03:01:41.991

REGULATIONS TO AREAS THAT BURNED

03:01:48.697 --> 03:01:50.766
IN A WILDFIRE TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:01:50.833 --> 03:01:52.835
OUR REINVESTMENTS IN THOSE

03:01:52.901 --> 03:01:55.337
COMMUNITIES ARE RESILIENT IN A

03:01:55.404 --> 03:01:57.072
FUTURE FIRE, IT DIRECTS THE

03:01:57.139 --> 03:01:59.441
STATE FIRE MARSHAL TO INCLUDE

03:01:59.508 --> 03:02:02.278

ADDRESS GAPS IN THEIR CURRENT

03:02:08.050 --> 03:02:10.419
PROCESS. THREE IT ENSURES THAT

03:02:10.486 --> 03:02:12.021
DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTIONS

03:02:12.087 --> 03:02:14.523
OCCUR ANNUALLY FOR EACH PROPERTY

03:02:14.590 --> 03:02:16.492
IN FIRE PRONE AREAS TO ENSURE

03:02:16.558 --> 03:02:19.128
THAT PROPERTY OWNERS ARE TAKING

03:02:19.194 --> 03:02:21.664
ACTION TO PROTECT THEIR

03:02:21.730 --> 03:02:23.065

VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS THAT HAVE

03:02:29.938 --> 03:02:32.474
ENGAGED IN THIS PROPOSAL. THE

03:02:32.541 --> 03:02:35.611
MOST RECENT AMENDMENTS GREATLY

03:02:35.678 --> 03:02:37.179
SIMPLIFY THE PROCESS, AND THE

03:02:37.246 --> 03:02:38.781
BILL MAKE IT EASIER TO IMPLEMENT

03:02:38.847 --> 03:02:41.283
THE POLICY. IT ADVANCES APPLYING

03:02:41.350 --> 03:02:43.018
THE MITIGATIONS THAT WE KNOW

03:02:43.085 --> 03:02:44.953
WORK FOR FIRE SAFETY TO AREAS

03:02:45.020 --> 03:02:47.323
THAT NEED THEM THE MOST. THEY

03:02:47.389 --> 03:02:49.491
ADDRESS THE BIGGEST ISSUES OF

03:02:49.558 --> 03:02:50.793
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE

03:02:50.859 --> 03:02:52.695
ON THE FRONT LINES AND ENSURE

03:02:52.761 --> 03:02:54.463
THE INTEGRITY OF THE SCIENCE

03:02:54.530 --> 03:02:55.898
UNDERLYING THE CURRENT FIRE

03:02:55.964 --> 03:02:58.033
HAZARD MAPS. BY HAVING THE STATE

03:02:58.100 --> 03:02:59.635
MARSHAL DO THE MAPPING OF AREAS

03:02:59.702 --> 03:03:01.870
THAT NEED TO COMPLY, IT TAKES

03:03:01.937 --> 03:03:03.839
THE POLITICS OUT OF THE MAPPING

03:03:03.906 --> 03:03:05.874
PROCESS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. I

03:03:05.941 --> 03:03:08.210
WILL BE CLEAR THIS IS NOT AN

03:03:08.277 --> 03:03:11.814
EASY BILL. MAKES EVERYONE FIRE

03:03:11.880 --> 03:03:13.916
AGENCIES, CITIES, COUNTIES,

03:03:13.982 --> 03:03:16.418
STATE HOMEOWNERS AND BUILDERS

03:03:16.485 --> 03:03:18.454
STRETCH A LITTLE FURTHER IN

03:03:18.520 --> 03:03:20.389
SERVICE OF A GOAL THAT WE ALL

03:03:20.456 --> 03:03:22.524
KNOW IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

03:03:22.591 --> 03:03:24.727
THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T SEE MUCH IN

03:03:24.793 --> 03:03:27.229
THE WAY OF SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION

03:03:27.296 --> 03:03:29.431
IN COMMITTEE TODAY. THAT

03:03:29.498 --> 03:03:30.866
HIGHLIGHTS THE BALANCE THAT THIS

03:03:30.933 --> 03:03:33.669
BILL STRIKES. EVERYONE MUST DO

03:03:33.736 --> 03:03:36.071
THEIR PART TO KEEP CALIFORNIANS

03:03:36.138 --> 03:03:38.774
SAFE FROM WILDFIRE. I

03:03:38.841 --> 03:03:41.243
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

ADDRESSING OUR FEEDBACK. THANK

03:04:35.297 --> 03:04:36.698
AFTERNOON, CHAIR AND MEMBERS,

03:04:36.765 --> 03:04:38.367
SEAN BELLOCK WITH THE CALIFORNIA

03:04:38.434 --> 03:04:39.535
ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. WE'RE

03:04:39.601 --> 03:04:41.770
NOT OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. IN

03:04:41.837 --> 03:04:42.971
FACT, WE SUPPORT THE EFFORT THAT

03:04:43.038 --> 03:04:44.440
THE SENATOR IS TRYING TO DO

03:04:44.506 --> 03:04:46.708
HERE. THE ONLY CONCERNS THAT COR

03:04:46.775 --> 03:04:49.178
HAS IS THE COSTS THAT THIS MIGHT

03:04:49.244 --> 03:04:51.713
IMPOSE, PARTICULARLY TO MIDDLE

03:04:51.780 --> 03:04:55.150
CLASS AND ALSO WORKING FAMILIES.

03:04:55.217 --> 03:04:57.319
THERE'S A PROVISION IN THE BILL

03:04:57.386 --> 03:04:59.154
FOR AN ANNUAL FEE. SO WE'RE

03:04:59.221 --> 03:05:00.255
WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS STAFF

03:05:00.322 --> 03:05:01.857
AND ALSO THE SENATE LOCAL

03:05:01.924 --> 03:05:03.392
GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE ON SOME

03:05:03.459 --> 03:05:04.726
LANGUAGE TO ACTUALLY JUST

03:05:04.793 --> 03:05:06.228
CONTAIN THE COST TO THE ACTUAL

03:05:06.295 --> 03:05:08.430
COST OF THE INSPECTION AND

03:05:08.497 --> 03:05:11.200
KEEPING THAT REASONABLE. SO

03:05:11.266 --> 03:05:12.901
WITHOUT THAT'S NOTHING FURTHER,

03:05:12.968 --> 03:05:13.969

MURATSUCHI. SO, SENATOR, THE

03:05:25.414 --> 03:05:28.183
BASIC IDEA IS THAT IF YOU HAD A

03:05:28.250 --> 03:05:29.384
WILDFIRE, YOU'RE MORE PRONE TO

03:05:29.451 --> 03:05:31.854
HAVE FUTURE WILDFIRES. AND SO WE

03:05:31.920 --> 03:05:33.188
NEED TO PUT MORE EFFORT INTO

03:05:33.255 --> 03:05:34.623
HARDENING THE HOMES. YES. OKAY.

03:05:34.690 --> 03:05:38.160

SENATOR ALLEN. PROUD TO

03:06:43.492 --> 03:06:46.228
REPRESENT UCLA IN THE STATE

03:06:46.295 --> 03:06:48.830
SENATE. BUT ALSO UC BERKELEY LAW

03:06:48.897 --> 03:06:51.233
SCHOOL GRAD. SO COLBERT'S GO

03:06:51.300 --> 03:06:53.502
BRUINS. WE'RE ALL IN IT

03:06:53.569 --> 03:06:54.836
TOGETHER. AND THAT'S WHAT BRINGS

03:06:54.903 --> 03:06:57.072
ME TO THIS BILL, WHICH IS ABOUT

03:06:57.139 --> 03:06:59.608
EV BATTERIES AND RECYCLING AND

03:06:59.675 --> 03:07:02.110
TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COME

03:07:02.177 --> 03:07:04.279
TOGETHER TO, TO ADDRESS A MAJOR

03:07:04.346 --> 03:07:06.214
CHALLENGE, WHICH IS THE FACT

03:07:06.281 --> 03:07:08.884
THAT WE HAVE A DESIRE TO REALLY

03:07:08.951 --> 03:07:10.452
GROW THE NUMBER OF EVS ON THE

03:07:10.519 --> 03:07:12.621
MARKET. AND YET THERE'S A MAJOR

03:07:12.688 --> 03:07:13.722
CHALLENGE ASSOCIATED WITH MAKING

03:07:13.789 --> 03:07:15.457
SURE THAT THOSE BATTERIES, WHICH

03:07:15.524 --> 03:07:18.694
ARE A REAL OPPORTUNITY FOR

03:07:18.760 --> 03:07:20.395
RECYCLING, GET RECYCLED. SO THIS

03:07:20.462 --> 03:07:23.031
BILL WOULD ESTABLISH A PROGRAM

03:07:23.098 --> 03:07:24.066
UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC

03:07:24.132 --> 03:07:25.334
SUBSTANCE CONTROL TO ENSURE

03:07:25.400 --> 03:07:27.736
PROPER MANAGEMENT OF END OF LIFE

03:07:27.803 --> 03:07:29.805
EV BATTERIES, PROMOTING A MORE

03:07:29.871 --> 03:07:30.606
SUSTAINABLE CIRCULAR ECONOMY,

03:07:30.672 --> 03:07:33.208
AND AVOIDING PROBLEMS CREATED BY

03:07:33.275 --> 03:07:35.277
MISMANAGED HAZARDOUS WASTE. YOU

03:07:35.344 --> 03:07:37.079
KNOW, I'VE WORKED ON RECYCLING

03:07:37.145 --> 03:07:39.247
ISSUES IN CIRCULARITY FOR A LONG

03:07:39.314 --> 03:07:40.248
TIME. THE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS

03:07:40.315 --> 03:07:41.617
PARTICULAR PRODUCT IS THAT THERE

03:07:41.683 --> 03:07:43.418
IS A REAL MARKET ASSOCIATED WITH

03:07:43.485 --> 03:07:45.954
THE, THE, THE, THE, THE, THE,

03:07:46.021 --> 03:07:47.723
THE COMPONENT PARTS OF EV

03:07:47.789 --> 03:07:50.926
BATTERIES. WE KNOW THAT

03:07:50.993 --> 03:07:52.527
RECYCLING END OF LIFE BATTERIES

03:07:52.594 --> 03:07:54.830
FROM ELECTRIC VEHICLES REDUCES

03:07:54.896 --> 03:07:56.365
THE DEMAND FOR RAW MATERIALS,

03:07:56.431 --> 03:07:57.466
THEREBY AVOIDING THE NEGATIVE

03:07:57.532 --> 03:07:58.667
SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

03:07:58.734 --> 03:08:01.503
OF MINING. IN SOME INSTANCES,

03:08:01.570 --> 03:08:02.871
BATTERIES CAN BE REPURPOSED FOR

03:08:02.938 --> 03:08:04.006
ENERGY STORAGE, FURTHER

03:08:04.072 --> 03:08:05.507
EXTENDING THEIR USEFUL LIFE. BUT

03:08:05.574 --> 03:08:06.875
THE PROBLEM IS, CALIFORNIA LACKS

03:08:06.942 --> 03:08:09.645
A POLICY FRAMEWORK TO ENSURE

03:08:09.711 --> 03:08:11.680
THESE BENEFICIAL OUTCOMES, WHICH

03:08:11.747 --> 03:08:13.382
WILL BECOME MORE PROBLEMATIC AS

03:08:13.448 --> 03:08:15.083
MORE EVS AND EV BATTERIES REACH

03:08:15.150 --> 03:08:16.518
THEIR END OF LIFE. AND IT COULD

03:08:16.585 --> 03:08:18.487
CREATE A HAZARDOUS WASTE CRISIS

03:08:18.553 --> 03:08:19.154
IF CLEAR PATHWAYS FOR MANAGEMENT

03:08:19.221 --> 03:08:21.623
ARE NOT ALREADY IN PLACE. WE'RE

03:08:21.690 --> 03:08:22.591
ALREADY SEEING EVIDENCE OF THIS

03:08:22.658 --> 03:08:24.793
GROWING PROBLEM, INCLUDING THE

03:08:24.860 --> 03:08:26.662
COMPLICATIONS THAT BURNED EV

03:08:26.728 --> 03:08:27.529
BATTERIES POSE IN THE CLEANUP OF

03:08:27.596 --> 03:08:29.431
THE LA FIRES AND HIS LOCAL

03:08:29.498 --> 03:08:30.632
HOUSEHOLD. HAZARDOUS WASTE

03:08:30.699 --> 03:08:33.168
FACILITIES ARE STARTING TO TAKE

03:08:33.235 --> 03:08:35.203
IN EV BATTERIES INTO THEIR

03:08:35.270 --> 03:08:37.706
FACILITIES. BUT A FEW YEARS

03:08:37.773 --> 03:08:39.241
BACK, YOU KNOW WHAT? SOME OF OUR

03:08:39.307 --> 03:08:40.208
REPUBLICAN FRIENDS HAVE

03:08:40.275 --> 03:08:42.744
REPEATEDLY RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT

03:08:42.811 --> 03:08:44.980
THE ALL THE CHALLENGES

03:08:45.047 --> 03:08:46.348
ASSOCIATED, THE SOCIAL

03:08:46.415 --> 03:08:48.183
CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH,

03:08:48.250 --> 03:08:50.185
WITH, WITH MINING FOR SOME OF

03:08:50.252 --> 03:08:52.154
THE COMPONENT PARTS OF EV

03:08:52.220 --> 03:08:54.723
BATTERIES. AND THEN ASSEMBLY

03:08:54.790 --> 03:08:57.259
MEMBER BRIAN DOORLEY PASSED AB

03:08:57.325 --> 03:08:58.827
2832 BACK IN 2018, WHICH CALLED

03:08:58.894 --> 03:09:00.796
FOR AN ADVISORY GROUP TO DEVELOP

03:09:00.862 --> 03:09:01.663
RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE

03:09:01.730 --> 03:09:02.998
LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE THAT AS

03:09:03.065 --> 03:09:05.200
CLOSE TO 100% AS POSSIBLE OF

03:09:05.267 --> 03:09:06.368
LITHIUM ION BATTERIES IN THE

03:09:06.435 --> 03:09:07.769
STATE ARE REUSED OR RECYCLED IN

03:09:07.836 --> 03:09:11.606
END OF LIFE, SO AS TO REDUCE THE

03:09:11.673 --> 03:09:14.676
STRAIN ON INTERNATIONAL MINING

03:09:14.743 --> 03:09:19.548
OF LITHIUM. SO THIS BILL IS A

03:09:19.614 --> 03:09:20.849
DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE REPORT

03:09:20.916 --> 03:09:22.617
THAT CAME OUT OF SENATOR DAHLE

03:09:22.684 --> 03:09:24.219
OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER DOLLY'S

03:09:24.286 --> 03:09:26.688
LEGISLATION. COUNTLESS HOURS OF

03:09:26.755 --> 03:09:28.490
STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK OVER THE

03:09:28.557 --> 03:09:29.458
PAST FEW YEARS. AND IT'S ALL

03:09:29.524 --> 03:09:31.660
ABOUT ENSURING THAT EV BATTERIES

03:09:31.727 --> 03:09:32.194
ARE PROPERLY HANDLED AND

03:09:32.260 --> 03:09:33.628
EVENTUALLY RECYCLED AT THE END

03:09:33.695 --> 03:09:35.497
OF THEIR USEFUL LIFE, AND IT

03:09:35.564 --> 03:09:37.232
ENCOURAGES REUSE, REPAIR, AND

03:09:37.299 --> 03:09:39.968
REPURPOSING WHENEVER FEASIBLE.

03:09:40.035 --> 03:09:41.803
YOU KNOW, IT BRINGS THE EV

03:09:41.870 --> 03:09:44.473
BATTERY SUPPLIERS INTO WITH

03:09:44.539 --> 03:09:46.274
REGARDS TO PROPER MANAGEMENT,

03:09:46.341 --> 03:09:47.609
RECYCLING OF END OF LIFE

03:09:47.676 --> 03:09:48.376
BATTERIES UNDER WARRANTY, AND

03:09:48.443 --> 03:09:49.644
OTHER BATTERIES OFFERED BACK TO

03:09:49.711 --> 03:09:50.512
THE APPROPRIATE BATTERY

03:09:50.579 --> 03:09:51.646
SUPPLIER, INCLUDING ASSOCIATED

03:09:51.713 --> 03:09:53.415
COSTS OF COLLECTION. THE BILL

03:09:53.482 --> 03:09:54.916
ALSO HOLDS ENTITIES THAT REMOVE

03:09:54.983 --> 03:09:56.151
A BATTERY FROM A VEHICLE, SUCH

03:09:56.218 --> 03:09:59.287
AS AN AUTO SHOP OR DISMANTLER,

03:09:59.354 --> 03:09:59.888
RESPONSIBLE FOR PROPER

03:09:59.955 --> 03:10:00.889
MANAGEMENT. THAT COULD MEAN

03:10:00.956 --> 03:10:02.958
RETURNING THE BATTERY TO THE

03:10:03.024 --> 03:10:03.592
MANUFACTURER. THAT COULD MEAN

03:10:03.658 --> 03:10:04.926
SELLING THE BATTERY TO BE USED

03:10:04.993 --> 03:10:06.394
FOR BATTERY STORAGE, OR SELLING

03:10:06.461 --> 03:10:08.864
IT TO A BATTERY RECYCLER. THE

03:10:08.930 --> 03:10:10.232
FLEXIBILITY OF THIS STRUCTURE IS

03:10:10.298 --> 03:10:12.167
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT SINCE,

03:10:12.234 --> 03:10:13.502
UNLIKE OTHER MATERIALS WE'VE

03:10:13.568 --> 03:10:14.736
SOUGHT TO MANAGE AT THE END OF

03:10:14.803 --> 03:10:16.772
LIFE, EV BATTERIES CONTAIN

03:10:16.838 --> 03:10:19.341
CRITICAL MINERALS COBALT,

03:10:19.407 --> 03:10:21.543
LITHIUM, NICKEL, WHICH MAKE THEM

03:10:21.610 --> 03:10:23.612
VERY VALUABLE IN GROWING AND

03:10:23.678 --> 03:10:25.213
ROBUST RECYCLING MARKET. AS YOU

03:10:25.280 --> 03:10:26.948
KNOW, I'VE WORKED A LOT IN

03:10:27.015 --> 03:10:29.818
PLASTICS. NOT AN EASY AREA TO

03:10:29.885 --> 03:10:31.987
CREATE A MARKET FOR THE RESALE

03:10:32.053 --> 03:10:32.988
OF RECYCLED PLASTIC MATERIAL

03:10:33.054 --> 03:10:35.190
BECAUSE IT'S SO CHEAP. IN THIS

03:10:35.257 --> 03:10:36.558
CASE, THESE ARE VALUABLE

03:10:36.625 --> 03:10:38.660
MINERALS AND METALS THAT THAT

03:10:38.727 --> 03:10:40.295
ACTUALLY DO HAVE A POTENTIAL AND

03:10:40.362 --> 03:10:44.266
A VIABLE MARKET. BUT SO BUT, BUT

03:10:44.332 --> 03:10:47.803
SO THE BILL, THE BILL SEEKS

03:10:47.869 --> 03:10:49.671
FLEXIBILITY SO AS TO ALLOW FOR

03:10:49.738 --> 03:10:51.840
THE HIGHEST AND BEST USE OF FOR

03:10:51.907 --> 03:10:53.475
WITH REGARDS TO RESALE OR REUSE

03:10:53.542 --> 03:10:56.745
OF THOSE MINERALS AND MATERIALS

03:10:56.812 --> 03:10:58.814
IN THE BATTERY. BUT IT ALSO IS

03:10:58.880 --> 03:10:59.681
DESIGNED TO INCLUDE PRODUCER

03:10:59.748 --> 03:11:01.216
RESPONSIBILITY AS A CRUCIAL

03:11:01.283 --> 03:11:02.250
BACKSTOP. IF THE RECYCLING

03:11:02.317 --> 03:11:04.019
MARKET AND THE VALUE OF THE

03:11:04.085 --> 03:11:05.086
BATTERY MATERIAL CHANGES OVER

03:11:05.153 --> 03:11:06.988
TIME, SO AS TO ENSURE PROPER END

03:11:07.055 --> 03:11:08.990
OF LIFE MANAGEMENT CONTINUES.

03:11:09.057 --> 03:11:10.525
REMEMBER MEMBERS, WE ARE ALL

03:11:10.592 --> 03:11:11.860
PAYING THE COST OF THE

03:11:11.927 --> 03:11:13.762
DYSFUNCTION OF THE SYSTEM WHEN A

03:11:13.829 --> 03:11:15.697
WHEN A BATTERY YOU KNOW, WHEN A

03:11:15.764 --> 03:11:20.168
CAR GOES TO GOES TO A REGULAR

03:11:20.235 --> 03:11:21.603
CAR DISMANTLER AND THE EV

03:11:21.670 --> 03:11:23.405
BATTERY IS NOT PROPERLY DISPOSED

03:11:23.471 --> 03:11:25.640
OF, NOT ONLY IS IT A MASSIVELY

03:11:25.707 --> 03:11:29.077
LOST OPPORTUNITY FOR REUSE, IT'S

03:11:29.144 --> 03:11:31.646
ALSO CREATES NEW TOXICITIES AND

03:11:31.713 --> 03:11:34.549
CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE

03:11:34.616 --> 03:11:36.418
WITH WITH WITH THE CRUSHED

03:11:36.484 --> 03:11:38.119
BATTERY THAT THEN IMPACTS THE

03:11:38.186 --> 03:11:39.221
ENVIRONMENT. IT INCREASES

03:11:39.287 --> 03:11:40.989
CLEANUP COSTS. IT INCREASES

03:11:41.056 --> 03:11:42.791
MANAGEMENT COSTS. AND WE ALL, AS

03:11:42.858 --> 03:11:43.959
RATEPAYERS AND TAXPAYERS ARE

03:11:44.025 --> 03:11:46.728
PAYING THE COST OF THAT. SO THIS

03:11:46.795 --> 03:11:48.630
WAS ACTUALLY YEAH. SO WITH ME

03:11:48.697 --> 03:11:50.465
TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE

03:11:50.532 --> 03:11:52.200
BILL. WE HAVE MICHELLE CANALES

03:11:52.267 --> 03:11:52.868
FROM THE UNION OF CONCERNED

03:11:52.934 --> 03:11:53.802
SCIENTISTS AND ALSO ALEXIS

03:11:53.869 --> 03:11:55.103
GEORGESON WHO'S HERE WITH

03:11:55.170 --> 03:11:56.605
REDWOOD MATERIALS. AND I WANT TO

03:11:56.671 --> 03:11:58.473
THANK BOTH OF THEM VERY MUCH FOR

03:11:58.540 --> 03:11:59.507
THEIR WORK ON THIS. YOU HAVE TWO

03:11:59.574 --> 03:12:01.009
MINUTES. YEAH. GOOD AFTERNOON,

03:12:01.076 --> 03:12:02.277
CHAIR AND MEMBERS, MICHELLE

03:12:02.344 --> 03:12:04.179
CANALES, ON BEHALF OF UNION OF

03:12:04.246 --> 03:12:04.846
CONCERNED SCIENTISTS IN SUPPORT

03:12:04.913 --> 03:12:07.415
OF SB 615, WE HAVE BEEN

03:12:07.482 --> 03:12:08.483
ADVOCATING FOR THE BROAD

03:12:08.550 --> 03:12:09.818
DEPLOYMENT OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES

03:12:09.885 --> 03:12:11.319
FOR YEARS BECAUSE OF THEIR CLEAR

03:12:11.386 --> 03:12:12.754
PUBLIC HEALTH AND CLIMATE

03:12:12.821 --> 03:12:14.522
BENEFITS. WITH THE INCREASE OF

03:12:14.589 --> 03:12:15.657
EVS ON THE ROAD, WE NEED TO

03:12:15.724 --> 03:12:17.225
ENSURE THAT THE CLEAN

03:12:17.292 --> 03:12:18.793
TRANSPORTATION FUTURE IS ALSO

03:12:18.860 --> 03:12:20.328
SUSTAINABLE. OVER THE NEXT

03:12:20.395 --> 03:12:21.930
DECADE, EV BATTERY RETIREMENTS

03:12:21.997 --> 03:12:24.599
ARE ESTIMATED TO INCREASE BY

03:12:24.666 --> 03:12:26.501
450%. IN CALIFORNIA, THIS WAVE

03:12:26.568 --> 03:12:28.270
OF RETIREMENTS WILL INCLUDE

03:12:28.336 --> 03:12:29.638
BATTERIES THAT ARE DAMAGED,

03:12:29.704 --> 03:12:30.605
DISPERSED AND THOSE THAT CONTAIN

03:12:30.672 --> 03:12:32.908
FEWER VALUABLE MINERALS AND ARE

03:12:32.974 --> 03:12:34.709
THEREFORE LESS PROFITABLE TO

03:12:34.776 --> 03:12:36.444
RECYCLE. WITHOUT POLICY

03:12:36.511 --> 03:12:37.579
INTERVENTION, BATTERIES MIGHT

03:12:37.646 --> 03:12:38.947
END UP IN HAZARDOUS WASTE

03:12:39.014 --> 03:12:40.982
LANDFILLS OR ABANDONED. TO AVOID

03:12:41.049 --> 03:12:42.684
THIS AND REDUCE THE NEED FOR

03:12:42.751 --> 03:12:45.487
NEWLY MINED MATERIAL, WE NEED SB

03:12:45.553 --> 03:12:47.222
615. SPECIFICALLY, THERE ARE

03:12:47.289 --> 03:12:48.523
THREE PROVISIONS THAT MAKE THIS

03:12:48.590 --> 03:12:50.859
BILL EFFECTIVE. FIRST, PRODUCER

03:12:50.926 --> 03:12:51.726
RESPONSIBILITY IS CRITICAL SO

03:12:51.793 --> 03:12:53.128
THAT WHEN MANUFACTURERS PUT

03:12:53.194 --> 03:12:55.163
THEIR VEHICLES OUT FOR SALE,

03:12:55.230 --> 03:12:57.032
THERE'S A CLEAR PLAN TO HAVE

03:12:57.098 --> 03:12:58.800
THEIR BATTERIES RESPONSIBLY,

03:12:58.867 --> 03:13:00.602
RESPONSIBLY MANAGED WHEN THEY

03:13:00.669 --> 03:13:02.070
RETIRE. PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY

03:13:02.137 --> 03:13:03.805
IS NOT A NEW CONCEPT FOR

03:13:03.872 --> 03:13:04.806
CALIFORNIA, AND BOTH THE

03:13:04.873 --> 03:13:06.308
EUROPEAN UNION AND NEW JERSEY

03:13:06.374 --> 03:13:07.776
HAVE PASSED SUCH POLICIES

03:13:07.842 --> 03:13:09.844
CONCERNING EV BATTERIES. SECOND,

03:13:09.911 --> 03:13:10.946
TRACKING AND REPORTING

03:13:11.012 --> 03:13:11.813
REQUIREMENTS IN THE BILL MAKE

03:13:11.880 --> 03:13:13.214
SURE BATTERIES ARE NOT GETTING

03:13:13.281 --> 03:13:14.883
LOST IN THE SHUFFLE, AND IF THEY

03:13:14.950 --> 03:13:16.484
DO, THESE REQUIREMENTS WILL

03:13:16.551 --> 03:13:17.419
PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE AND

03:13:17.485 --> 03:13:19.287
STATE AGENCIES WITH THE

03:13:19.354 --> 03:13:20.789
INFORMATION NEEDED TO IDENTIFY

03:13:20.855 --> 03:13:22.490
AND RECTIFY ANY PROBLEMS,

03:13:22.557 --> 03:13:23.992
INCLUDING INSUFFICIENT MINERAL

03:13:24.059 --> 03:13:26.828
RECOVERY RATES. FINALLY, SB 615

03:13:26.895 --> 03:13:28.363
SEEKS TO PREVENT BATTERIES FROM

03:13:28.430 --> 03:13:29.764
BEING PROCESSED WITH HARMFUL AND

03:13:29.831 --> 03:13:30.832
INEFFICIENT RECYCLING

03:13:30.899 --> 03:13:31.933
TECHNOLOGIES TO ENSURE METHODS

03:13:32.000 --> 03:13:33.702
ARE SAFE AND SUSTAINABLE. WE'RE

03:13:33.768 --> 03:13:34.836
GRATEFUL TO SENATOR ALLEN AND

03:13:34.903 --> 03:13:36.738
HIS STAFF FOR THEIR TIRELESS

03:13:36.805 --> 03:13:38.273
EFFORTS ON THIS BILL, AND WE

03:13:38.340 --> 03:13:39.908
RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE

03:13:39.975 --> 03:13:43.812

OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AT

03:13:48.516 --> 03:13:50.251
REDWOOD MATERIALS. REDWOOD

03:13:50.318 --> 03:13:52.120
STRONGLY SUPPORTS SB 615 AS A

03:13:52.187 --> 03:13:53.621
THOUGHTFUL POLICY FRAMEWORK THAT

03:13:53.688 --> 03:13:54.956
RECOGNIZES THE VALUE OF EV

03:13:55.023 --> 03:13:56.825
BATTERIES AT END OF LIFE AND THE

03:13:56.891 --> 03:13:57.726
SIGNIFICANT MARKET OPPORTUNITY

03:13:57.792 --> 03:13:59.594
THAT THEY REPRESENT. REDWOOD IS

03:13:59.661 --> 03:14:00.795
BUILDING THE FIRST FULLY

03:14:00.862 --> 03:14:02.464
INTEGRATED U.S. BATTERY SUPPLY

03:14:02.530 --> 03:14:03.732
CHAIN. TODAY, WE RECEIVE MORE

03:14:03.798 --> 03:14:05.567
THAN 20 GIGAWATT HOURS ANNUALLY

03:14:05.633 --> 03:14:07.168
OF END OF LIFE BATTERIES. THAT'S

03:14:07.235 --> 03:14:09.371
THE EQUIVALENT OF ABOUT 250,000

03:14:09.437 --> 03:14:10.772
ELECTRIC VEHICLES THAT COME

03:14:10.839 --> 03:14:12.841
THROUGH OUR DOOR, AND WE ARE

03:14:12.907 --> 03:14:15.243
ABLE TO RECOVER ABOUT 95% OF

03:14:15.310 --> 03:14:16.578
THOSE CRITICAL MINERALS AND

03:14:16.644 --> 03:14:18.780
RETURN THEM TO THE SUPPLY CHAIN.

03:14:18.847 --> 03:14:19.748
THROUGH OUR NEW BUSINESS,

03:14:19.814 --> 03:14:20.882
REDWOOD ENERGY, WE ARE ALREADY

03:14:20.949 --> 03:14:22.684
DEPLOYING REPURPOSED EV BATTERY

03:14:22.751 --> 03:14:24.019
PACKS AS WELL INTO STATIONARY

03:14:24.085 --> 03:14:25.487
STORAGE APPLICATIONS TO MEET

HAD THE EXACT SAME NUMBERED BILL

03:18:04.639 --> 03:18:06.941
LAST YEAR. I KNOW I SAW THAT

03:18:07.008 --> 03:18:09.110
TOO. YEAH. WELL, SOMETIMES,

03:18:09.177 --> 03:18:11.312

YEAH. YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT A BILL

03:18:17.085 --> 03:18:18.419
NUMBER, A FEW, A FEW MINUTES I

03:18:18.486 --> 03:18:20.588
CAN, I CAN, I CAN SPEND. AND

03:18:20.655 --> 03:18:22.323
THIS IS WHERE I DECIDED TO

03:18:22.390 --> 03:18:23.258
REALLY SPEND MY POLITICAL

03:18:23.324 --> 03:18:25.793
CAPITAL. OKAY. YEAH. YOU KNOW, I

03:18:25.860 --> 03:18:27.428
WAS JUST GOING TO LOOK AT THE,

03:18:27.495 --> 03:18:29.731
THE SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION

03:18:29.797 --> 03:18:31.466
LETTERS, BUT BUT IT'D BE FASTER

03:18:31.532 --> 03:18:33.368
IF I CAN ASK YOU. I MEAN, WHY

03:18:33.434 --> 03:18:34.802
WHY IS FORD MOTOR AND SUPPORT

03:18:34.869 --> 03:18:36.537
BUT TESLA AND RIVIAN OPPOSED.

03:18:36.604 --> 03:18:38.006
YEAH. SO WE WORKED REALLY HARD

03:18:38.072 --> 03:18:39.707
WITH THE AUTOMOBILE

03:18:39.774 --> 03:18:41.576
MANUFACTURERS LAST YEAR TO GET

03:18:41.643 --> 03:18:43.678
THIS TO A GOOD A GOOD PLACE. AND

03:18:43.745 --> 03:18:45.480
I THINK, YOU KNOW, IT'S WHY, YOU

03:18:45.546 --> 03:18:47.982
KNOW, IN FACT, THIS WHOLE THING

03:18:48.049 --> 03:18:49.350
BECAME SOMETHING I REALLY WANTED

03:18:49.417 --> 03:18:51.152
TO WORK ON. WHEN I HEARD FOLKS

03:18:51.219 --> 03:18:52.420
FROM AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS

03:18:52.487 --> 03:18:54.789
TALKING ABOUT THE NEED FOR THIS.

03:18:54.856 --> 03:18:57.625
AND SO I THINK WHAT'S HAPPENED

03:18:57.692 --> 03:19:00.128
ESSENTIALLY IS AND MAYBE, MAYBE

03:19:00.194 --> 03:19:01.696
OUR FRIENDS CAN CAN SPEAK A

03:19:01.763 --> 03:19:03.498
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT IT. BUT I

03:19:03.564 --> 03:19:07.435
THINK WE FEEL AS THOUGH WE CAN.

03:19:07.502 --> 03:19:09.370
I DON'T I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK

03:19:09.437 --> 03:19:10.471
FOR ALL THE PLAYERS, BUT I DON'T

03:19:10.538 --> 03:19:12.373
THINK WE'RE SUPER FAR WITH SOME

03:19:12.440 --> 03:19:13.408
OF THE MANUFACTURERS. THIS COMES

03:19:13.474 --> 03:19:16.277
DOWN TO A QUESTION OF

03:19:16.344 --> 03:19:19.280
RESPONSIBILITY. WHEN ITEMS, WHEN

03:19:19.347 --> 03:19:21.482
BATTERIES END UP IN THE HANDS OF

03:19:21.549 --> 03:19:25.787
KIND OF. INDEPENDENT

03:19:25.853 --> 03:19:26.921
REFURBISHERS FOLKS WORKING ON

03:19:26.988 --> 03:19:28.656
THE CARS. AND, YOU KNOW, TO WHAT

03:19:28.723 --> 03:19:30.458
EXTENT SHOULD THE MANUFACTURER

03:19:30.525 --> 03:19:35.196
BE RESPONSIBLE FOR. FOR A

03:19:35.263 --> 03:19:36.564
BATTERY THAT WAS HANDLED BY

03:19:36.631 --> 03:19:37.498
SOMEONE THAT'S NOT WITHIN THEIR

03:19:37.565 --> 03:19:39.067
CHAIN OF COMMAND? THAT'S THAT'S

03:19:39.133 --> 03:19:41.402
THE ESSENTIAL QUESTION. I THINK

03:19:41.469 --> 03:19:43.471
YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF

03:19:43.538 --> 03:19:43.971
MANUFACTURERS THAT FEEL

03:19:44.038 --> 03:19:44.839
COMFORTABLE WITH THE SYSTEM THAT

03:19:44.906 --> 03:19:46.908
WE'VE PUT IN PLACE. THERE ARE A

03:19:46.974 --> 03:19:51.045
FEW THAT WANT SOME ADDITIONAL

03:19:51.112 --> 03:19:52.714
ASSURANCES BUILT INTO THE BILL.

03:19:52.780 --> 03:19:54.582
OUR CHALLENGE IS HOW DO WE DO

03:19:54.649 --> 03:19:55.683
THIS IN A WAY THAT'S STILL GOING

03:19:55.750 --> 03:19:57.652
TO BE WORKABLE, BUT I DON'T KNOW

03:19:57.719 --> 03:20:00.021
IF YOU WANT TO SPEAK A LITTLE

03:20:00.088 --> 03:20:00.455
FURTHER ABOUT YOUR

03:20:00.521 --> 03:20:01.422
CONVERSATIONS. SURE. YES. I

03:20:01.489 --> 03:20:03.191
WON'T SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE

03:20:03.257 --> 03:20:04.859
AUTOMAKERS AND THEIR POSITION ON

03:20:04.926 --> 03:20:05.727
THEIR THEIR OPPOSITION ON THIS

03:20:05.793 --> 03:20:07.261
RIGHT NOW. BUT, YOU KNOW, I

03:20:07.328 --> 03:20:08.696
MEAN, OUR PERSPECTIVE ON THIS

03:20:08.763 --> 03:20:10.732
IS, IS THAT IN IN WORKS WITH

03:20:10.798 --> 03:20:12.367
SENATOR ALLEN AND TEAM OVER THE

03:20:12.433 --> 03:20:14.135
LAST COUPLE OF YEARS SINCE SINCE

03:20:14.202 --> 03:20:15.570
615 HAS BEEN PART OF THE

03:20:15.636 --> 03:20:16.804
DISCUSSION. YOU KNOW, THIS THIS

03:20:16.871 --> 03:20:17.705
BILL HAS NOW REALLY ACHIEVED

03:20:17.772 --> 03:20:19.273
SOMETHING THAT THAT WE

03:20:19.340 --> 03:20:20.808
PERSONALLY THINK WORKS VERY WELL

03:20:20.875 --> 03:20:22.944
FOR THE MARKET AND ALSO ENSURES

03:20:23.010 --> 03:20:23.811
THAT THESE BATTERIES ARE

03:20:23.878 --> 03:20:24.946
RESPONSIBLY RECYCLED. AND I

03:20:25.012 --> 03:20:26.347
THINK THAT'S THAT'S A REALLY

03:20:26.414 --> 03:20:27.648
CRITICAL BALANCE HERE. YOU KNOW,

03:20:27.715 --> 03:20:29.217
IT AVOIDS A PRO MODEL, WHICH I

03:20:29.283 --> 03:20:30.585
THINK WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY

03:20:30.651 --> 03:20:32.086
BURDENSOME AND COSTLY AND HAD

03:20:32.153 --> 03:20:33.388
VERY NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON THE

03:20:33.454 --> 03:20:34.655
INDUSTRY. SO, YOU KNOW, WE'RE

03:20:34.722 --> 03:20:37.058
WE'RE VERY, VERY HAPPY ABOUT THE

03:20:37.125 --> 03:20:38.793
BALANCE FOR THE MARKET

03:20:38.860 --> 03:20:39.427
OPPORTUNITIES HERE. AND I THINK

03:20:39.494 --> 03:20:40.995
WHAT CALIFORNIA WANTS TO

03:20:41.062 --> 03:20:49.337
ACHIEVE. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER

03:20:49.404 --> 03:20:52.140

SEEING NONE. SENATOR WOULD YOU

03:20:53.274 --> 03:20:56.878

03:20:57.879 --> 03:20:59.480
APPRECIATE HAVING THE CHANCE TO

03:20:59.547 --> 03:21:00.848
WORK ON THIS THIS REALLY

03:21:00.915 --> 03:21:02.083
DIFFICULT BUT BUT VERY IMPORTANT

03:21:02.150 --> 03:21:03.785
ISSUE. AND YOU KNOW, ULTIMATELY

03:21:03.851 --> 03:21:05.219
THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT

03:21:05.286 --> 03:21:07.522
WE HAVE A GOOD SYSTEM IN PLACE

03:21:07.588 --> 03:21:08.656
FOR THE COLLECTION OF THIS

03:21:08.723 --> 03:21:10.491
REALLY REUSABLE MATERIAL. AND

03:21:10.558 --> 03:21:12.293
THAT'S THE THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF

AND THERE'S REAL OPPORTUNITIES

03:21:19.901 --> 03:21:22.403
FOR A MARKET. IF WE CAN FIND A

03:21:22.470 --> 03:21:24.472
SMART, CAPABLE WAY OF COLLECTING

03:21:24.539 --> 03:21:26.073

PROCESS, AND TO REPORT THAT TO

03:23:20.988 --> 03:23:22.690
CALRECYCLE, CALIFORNIA IS

03:23:22.757 --> 03:23:23.824
COMMITTED TO INCREASING THE

03:23:23.891 --> 03:23:25.226
PERCENTAGE OF RECYCLED CONTENT

03:23:25.293 --> 03:23:28.162
IN PLASTIC BOTTLES WITH AB 793

03:23:28.229 --> 03:23:30.631
TÍNH IN 2020, IT SET AMBITIOUS

03:23:30.698 --> 03:23:32.400
TARGETS OF 25% RECYCLED CONTENT

03:23:32.466 --> 03:23:35.703
BY 2025 AND 50% RECYCLED CONTENT

03:23:35.770 --> 03:23:37.738
BY 2030. THESE TARGETS HAVE

03:23:37.805 --> 03:23:39.907
INCREASED DEMAND FOR RECYCLED

03:23:39.974 --> 03:23:41.042
PLASTIC, MUCH OF WHICH IS NOW

03:23:41.108 --> 03:23:42.510
IMPORTED FROM OUT OF STATE AND

03:23:42.577 --> 03:23:43.945
INTERNATIONAL RECLAIMERS.

03:23:44.011 --> 03:23:45.446
HOWEVER, NO CURRENT SYSTEM

03:23:45.513 --> 03:23:47.181
EXISTS TO VERIFY THE

03:23:47.248 --> 03:23:49.116
AUTHENTICITY OF RECYCLED CONTENT

03:23:49.183 --> 03:23:50.785
CLAIMS THAT ARE MADE BY BEVERAGE

03:23:50.851 --> 03:23:52.553
MANUFACTURERS. IN FACT, RECYCLED

03:23:52.620 --> 03:23:54.021
PLASTIC IS INDISTINGUISHABLE

03:23:54.088 --> 03:23:55.890
FROM NEW PLASTIC AFTER IT HAS

03:23:55.957 --> 03:23:58.025
BEEN PROCESSED BY RECLAIMERS AND

03:23:58.092 --> 03:24:00.127
PELLETIZED OR MADE INTO FLAKES.

03:24:00.194 --> 03:24:01.562
RECENT REPORTING HAS FOUND

03:24:01.629 --> 03:24:03.397
EVIDENCE THAT NEW PLASTIC IS

03:24:03.464 --> 03:24:04.932
MASQUERADING AS RECYCLED

03:24:04.999 --> 03:24:05.733
PLASTIC, AND AT LEAST SOME OF

03:24:05.800 --> 03:24:07.602
THE PLASTIC IMPORTED INTO THE

03:24:07.668 --> 03:24:09.370
STATE. MEANWHILE, THE PLASTICS

03:24:09.437 --> 03:24:10.805
INDUSTRY IS THE FASTEST GROWING

03:24:10.871 --> 03:24:12.573
SOURCE OF CO2 EMISSIONS AND IS

03:24:12.640 --> 03:24:14.141
ON TRACK TO SURPASS

03:24:14.208 --> 03:24:16.043
TRANSPORTATION AND THE OIL AND

03:24:16.110 --> 03:24:17.411
GAS SECTORS. ACCORDING TO THE

03:24:17.478 --> 03:24:18.879
UN, OVER 1 MILLION PLASTIC

03:24:18.946 --> 03:24:20.214
BOTTLES ARE PURCHASED EVERY

03:24:20.281 --> 03:24:21.849
MINUTE. WE MUST DO EVERYTHING WE

03:24:21.916 --> 03:24:23.951
CAN TO CURB THE PRODUCTION OF

03:24:24.018 --> 03:24:24.885
NEW PLASTIC AND ENCOURAGE THE

03:24:24.952 --> 03:24:26.954
USE OF RECYCLED PLASTIC TO HELP

03:24:27.021 --> 03:24:28.990
REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS. A

03:24:29.056 --> 03:24:30.458
ROBUST THIRD PARTY CERTIFICATION

03:24:30.524 --> 03:24:31.926
OF THIS PLASTIC WOULD HELP

03:24:31.993 --> 03:24:33.828
REGAIN TRUST IN THE RECYCLING

03:24:33.894 --> 03:24:34.996
SYSTEM AND ENCOURAGE MORE

03:24:35.062 --> 03:24:36.864
SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS PRACTICES.

03:24:36.931 --> 03:24:39.333
SB 633 REQUIRES BEVERAGE

03:24:39.400 --> 03:24:40.434
MANUFACTURERS TO VERIFY THE

03:24:40.501 --> 03:24:41.902
RECYCLED PLASTIC THEY USE

03:24:41.969 --> 03:24:43.404
THROUGH THIRD PARTY

03:24:43.471 --> 03:24:44.038
CERTIFICATION THAT MEETS

03:24:44.105 --> 03:24:46.140
SPECIFIED STANDARDS TO CAL

RECYCLE CALIFORNIA ADOPTED A

03:24:47.842 --> 03:24:49.410
SIMILAR SET OF THIRD PARTY

03:24:49.477 --> 03:24:51.178
REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO VERIFY

03:24:51.245 --> 03:24:52.647
RECYCLED PLASTIC AND REUSABLE

03:24:52.713 --> 03:24:54.548
GROCERY BAGS UNDER THE OLD BAG

03:24:54.615 --> 03:24:56.617
LAW. WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT 23

03:24:56.684 --> 03:24:58.352
OUT OF 30 BAG MANUFACTURERS WERE

03:24:58.419 --> 03:24:59.887
NOT ABLE TO PROVE THAT THEIR

03:24:59.954 --> 03:25:01.288
BAGS WERE MADE OUT OF RECYCLED

03:25:01.355 --> 03:25:03.357
MATERIAL. THIS TELLS US THAT WE

03:25:03.424 --> 03:25:04.925
NEED TO TRUST BUT VERIFY MODEL

03:25:04.992 --> 03:25:07.395
FOR RECYCLED PLASTIC IN BOTTLES

03:25:07.461 --> 03:25:08.562
TO CALIFORNIA RECENTLY INCREASED

03:25:08.629 --> 03:25:10.164
THE DEMAND FOR RECYCLED PLASTIC

03:25:10.231 --> 03:25:11.465
IN CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE

03:25:11.532 --> 03:25:13.534
REQUIREMENTS OF AB 793, AND THE

03:25:13.601 --> 03:25:15.403
MARKET HAS RESPONDED BY

03:25:15.469 --> 03:25:16.871
DRAMATICALLY INCREASING IMPORTS,

03:25:16.937 --> 03:25:18.673
REACHING AN ALL TIME HIGH. AS OF

03:25:18.739 --> 03:25:20.408
LAST YEAR, IMPORTS FROM OUT OF

03:25:20.474 --> 03:25:21.976
STATE AND INTERNATIONAL

03:25:22.043 --> 03:25:23.210
RECLAIMERS ARE OF UNKNOWN

03:25:23.277 --> 03:25:25.479
QUALITY. SB 633 WOULD PROVIDE

03:25:25.546 --> 03:25:26.814
INSIGHT INTO RECLAIMERS

03:25:26.881 --> 03:25:29.116
PROCESSES AND GIVE ASSURANCE TO

03:25:29.183 --> 03:25:29.750
CONSUMERS THAT IMPORTED PLASTIC

03:25:29.817 --> 03:25:31.585
IS ACTUALLY RECYCLED PLASTIC.

03:25:31.652 --> 03:25:33.788
THE BILL IS SUPPORTED BY A BROAD

03:25:33.854 --> 03:25:34.455
COALITION OF STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS

03:25:34.522 --> 03:25:36.290
THE RECYCLING SUPPLY CHAIN. AND

03:25:36.357 --> 03:25:38.492
WITH ME TODAY I HAVE ALISON

03:25:38.559 --> 03:25:39.827
KOSTIC ON BEHALF OF THE

RECYCLERS, THE SPONSOR OF THE

03:25:44.265 --> 03:25:46.967

03:25:50.971 --> 03:25:52.573
RECYCLERS, APRIL, AND WE'RE THE

03:25:52.640 --> 03:25:54.642
PROUD SPONSORS OF THIS BILL, AND

03:25:54.709 --> 03:25:56.210
GRATEFUL FOR SENATOR BLAKE

03:25:56.277 --> 03:25:56.777
AUTHORSHIP AND THE WORK OF

03:25:56.844 --> 03:25:58.512
STAFF. APRIL MEMBERS ARE THE

03:25:58.579 --> 03:26:00.481
COMPANIES THAT RECYCLE CLOSE TO

03:26:00.548 --> 03:26:02.149
5 BILLION POUNDS OF PLASTIC

03:26:02.216 --> 03:26:03.584
PACKAGING EACH YEAR, AND OUR

03:26:03.651 --> 03:26:04.685
MEMBERSHIP INCLUDES SIX

03:26:04.752 --> 03:26:05.986
CALIFORNIA PLASTIC RECYCLERS AND

03:26:06.053 --> 03:26:07.888
DOZENS OF OTHER CALIFORNIA

03:26:07.955 --> 03:26:08.989
BUSINESSES ACROSS THE VALUE

03:26:09.056 --> 03:26:10.925
CHAIN OF PLASTICS RECYCLING. AND

03:26:10.991 --> 03:26:12.993
I WANT TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO

03:26:13.060 --> 03:26:14.462
THREE SMALL WORDS IN THIS BILL

03:26:14.528 --> 03:26:15.429
COUNTRY OF ORIGIN. AND THIS IS

03:26:15.496 --> 03:26:17.398
WHY THIS BILL REALLY MATTERS.

03:26:17.465 --> 03:26:18.799
THIS BILL IS NEEDED TO SOLVE A

03:26:18.866 --> 03:26:20.835
SPECIFIC PROBLEM THAT BEVERAGE

03:26:20.901 --> 03:26:23.003
COMPANIES AND OTHER PLASTIC

03:26:23.070 --> 03:26:25.206
PRODUCER PACKAGING PRODUCERS ARE

03:26:25.272 --> 03:26:27.341
BUYING RECYCLED PLASTICS FROM

03:26:27.408 --> 03:26:28.442
OVERSEAS, RATHER THAN BUYING

03:26:28.509 --> 03:26:30.644
THEM FROM CALIFORNIA OR US

03:26:30.711 --> 03:26:32.246
RECYCLERS. CALIFORNIA RECYCLERS

03:26:32.313 --> 03:26:33.748
ARE REALLY STRUGGLING TO STAY IN

03:26:33.814 --> 03:26:35.015
BUSINESS BECAUSE THEY CANNOT

03:26:35.082 --> 03:26:37.151
SELL THEIR RECYCLED PLASTICS,

03:26:37.218 --> 03:26:38.619
AND THE STATE HASN'T INVESTED IN

03:26:38.686 --> 03:26:39.854
BUILDING A STRONG PLASTICS

03:26:39.920 --> 03:26:41.489
RECYCLING SYSTEM THROUGH LAWS

03:26:41.555 --> 03:26:43.691
SUCH AS SB 54 AND OTHERS. THESE

03:26:43.758 --> 03:26:45.426
ARE MAJOR COMMITMENTS TO RECYCLE

03:26:45.493 --> 03:26:47.795
MORE PLASTICS. THESE POLICIES

03:26:47.862 --> 03:26:50.030
WILL COLLECT THOUSANDS OF POUNDS

03:26:50.097 --> 03:26:52.533
OF RECYCLABLE MATERIAL. BUT IF

03:26:52.600 --> 03:26:54.535
CALIFORNIA RECYCLERS CAN'T SELL

03:26:54.602 --> 03:26:56.504
THEIR PRODUCT, THERE WILL BE NO

03:26:56.570 --> 03:26:58.339
BUSINESSES LEFT TO RECYCLE THE

03:26:58.405 --> 03:26:59.373
MATERIAL THAT CALIFORNIA

03:26:59.440 --> 03:27:00.875
COLLECTS. AND THAT'S A BIG

03:27:00.941 --> 03:27:02.510
PROBLEM. WE ARE NOT HERE TO

03:27:02.576 --> 03:27:04.044
SUBSIDIZE RECYCLING IN ASIA OR

03:27:04.111 --> 03:27:05.846
OTHER COMPANIES. WE'RE HERE TO

03:27:05.913 --> 03:27:07.515
GROW RECYCLING IN CALIFORNIA AND

03:27:07.581 --> 03:27:09.150
TO SUPPORT CALIFORNIA AND US

03:27:09.216 --> 03:27:10.918
RECYCLING BUSINESSES. AND THIS

03:27:10.985 --> 03:27:12.319
BILL STARTS WITH REPORTING ON

03:27:12.386 --> 03:27:14.488
THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN, SO WE CAN

03:27:14.555 --> 03:27:16.090
TRACK HOW MUCH PLASTIC IS COMING

03:27:16.157 --> 03:27:17.758
IN FROM OVERSEAS. IT'S ABOUT

03:27:17.825 --> 03:27:18.459
TRANSPARENCY AND REQUIRING

03:27:18.526 --> 03:27:20.261
PUBLIC INFORMATION TO UNDERSCORE

03:27:20.327 --> 03:27:22.363
THE PROBLEM. I URGE YOUR AYE

03:27:22.429 --> 03:27:23.931

THANK YOU. CHAIR MEMBERS CHRIS,

BILL IN PRINT TODAY, WE REALLY

03:28:00.267 --> 03:28:01.268
NEED TO REVIEW THE PROPOSED

03:28:07.942 --> 03:28:08.475
GIMMICK. AND WE ARE IMMENSELY

03:28:08.542 --> 03:28:09.343
GRATEFUL TO HAVING WORKED WITH

03:28:09.410 --> 03:28:10.811
THE SPONSOR AND SENATOR BLAKE

03:28:10.878 --> 03:28:12.379
SPEAR ON THIS BILL SO FAR, AND

03:28:12.446 --> 03:28:14.181
FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP IN THIS

03:28:14.248 --> 03:28:16.050
SPACE. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

03:28:16.116 --> 03:28:23.757
OPPOSITION. COME ON DOWN. TWO

03:28:23.824 --> 03:28:27.995
MINUTES APIECE. HOPEFULLY IT

03:28:28.062 --> 03:28:31.332
WON'T TAKE THAT LONG. NO, WE'LL

03:28:31.398 --> 03:28:33.434
FIGURE IT OUT. THANK YOU VERY

03:28:33.500 --> 03:28:34.435
MUCH, DENNIS. ON BEHALF OF

03:28:34.501 --> 03:28:35.069
AMERICAN BEVERAGE ASSOCIATION,

03:28:35.135 --> 03:28:37.538
WE AGREE WHOLEHEARTEDLY AND

03:28:37.605 --> 03:28:40.207
FULLY WITH THE SENATOR'S FOCUS

03:28:40.274 --> 03:28:42.142
ON THE CERTIFICATION, MAKING

03:28:42.209 --> 03:28:44.578
SURE THAT THAT THE MATERIAL THAT

03:28:44.645 --> 03:28:47.014
WE ARE BUYING IS ACTUALLY

03:28:47.081 --> 03:28:48.215
POST-CONSUMER RESIN AND ACTUALLY

03:28:48.282 --> 03:28:49.984
WORKED FROM THE GENESIS OF THIS

03:28:50.050 --> 03:28:53.153
BILL IN DRIVING TOWARDS A

03:28:53.220 --> 03:28:53.988
CERTIFICATION PROGRAM THAT'S

03:28:54.054 --> 03:28:57.791
NARROWLY FOCUSED, TIGHTLY

03:28:57.858 --> 03:29:00.327
DEVELOPED AND FOCUSED ON THAT

03:29:00.394 --> 03:29:03.197
ELEMENT OF IT. THE SPONSOR ALSO

03:29:03.264 --> 03:29:04.832
MENTIONED THE OTHER SIDE OF THE

03:29:04.899 --> 03:29:06.433
BILL, WHICH IS COUNTRY OF

03:29:06.500 --> 03:29:08.669
ORIGIN, AND WE SEE THAT

03:29:08.736 --> 03:29:10.404
CERTIFICATION PROGRAM THAT WOULD

03:29:10.471 --> 03:29:12.740
VERIFY THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY

03:29:12.806 --> 03:29:13.707
POST-CONSUMER RESIDENT HAS

03:29:13.774 --> 03:29:16.577
VALUE. THE WHERE THE RESIN

03:29:16.644 --> 03:29:18.012
DEVELOPS, AS LONG AS IT'S

03:29:18.078 --> 03:29:20.147
CERTIFIED IS ESSENTIALLY

03:29:20.214 --> 03:29:21.949
IRRELEVANT TO THE CONVERSATION.

03:29:22.016 --> 03:29:24.118
THEY ALSO THE BILL PUTS THAT

03:29:24.184 --> 03:29:25.486
BURDEN ON THE BEVERAGE

03:29:25.552 --> 03:29:27.388
MANUFACTURERS WHO DO NOT HAVE

03:29:27.454 --> 03:29:29.290
FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE OF WHERE

03:29:29.356 --> 03:29:30.591
THAT MATERIAL COMES FROM. WE ARE

03:29:30.658 --> 03:29:32.426
NOT THE BOTTLE MANUFACTURER.

03:29:32.493 --> 03:29:33.460
WE'RE THE BEVERAGE. THE ENTITIES

03:29:33.527 --> 03:29:35.262
THAT PUT THE WATER, THE, THE,

03:29:35.329 --> 03:29:37.965
THE BEVERAGE INTO THE BOTTLE

03:29:38.032 --> 03:29:39.967
ITSELF. AND SO WHERE THAT IS, WE

03:29:40.034 --> 03:29:43.871
WOULD PUT THE IF KHÓ IS REALLY

03:29:43.938 --> 03:29:45.572
THAT IMPORTANT, WHICH WE

03:29:45.639 --> 03:29:48.042
QUESTION THE VALUE OF THE DATA,

03:29:48.108 --> 03:29:49.877
THEN IT SHOULD BE ON THE

03:29:49.944 --> 03:29:50.644
SUPPLIERS WHO ACTUALLY HAVE

03:29:50.711 --> 03:29:53.213
FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE OF THAT

03:29:53.280 --> 03:29:54.548
MATERIAL, WHO THEY, YOU KNOW,

03:29:54.615 --> 03:29:55.649
WHICH COUNTRY OR WHERE THEY

03:29:55.716 --> 03:29:57.851
BOUGHT IT FROM AND HOW THAT

03:29:57.918 --> 03:29:59.620
ENDED UP INTO CALIFORNIA AND

03:29:59.687 --> 03:30:02.156
WHERE IT IS, AGAIN, UP THE

03:30:02.222 --> 03:30:04.625
SUPPLY CHAIN. WE ARE THE FOLKS

03:30:04.692 --> 03:30:06.760
THAT PUT IT IN, PUT THE BEVERAGE

03:30:06.827 --> 03:30:08.762
INTO THE BOTTLE. AND SO WE DON'T

03:30:08.829 --> 03:30:09.396
NECESSARILY HAVE FIRSTHAND

03:30:09.463 --> 03:30:11.265
KNOWLEDGE AND WOULD LIKE TO

03:30:11.332 --> 03:30:13.033
ADDRESS THAT ISSUE MUCH MORE

03:30:13.100 --> 03:30:14.435
NARROWLY TAILORED. AND LET'S

03:30:14.501 --> 03:30:16.971
FOCUS ON THE CERTIFICATION OF

03:30:17.037 --> 03:30:18.806
THE MATERIAL ITSELF. THANK YOU.

03:30:18.872 --> 03:30:20.541
THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU, MR.

03:30:20.607 --> 03:30:21.542
CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS, ISLA

03:30:21.608 --> 03:30:22.776
GARCIA, FOR THE INTERNATIONAL

03:30:22.843 --> 03:30:24.712
BOTTLED WATER ASSOCIATION. I

03:30:24.778 --> 03:30:26.347
WANT TO ASSOCIATE OUR COMMENTS

03:30:26.413 --> 03:30:28.382
WITH MR. ALVIANI AND ABBA. OUR

03:30:28.449 --> 03:30:29.783
MEMBERS ARE VERY, VERY MUCH

03:30:29.850 --> 03:30:32.086
FOCUSED ON MEETING THE VERY

03:30:32.152 --> 03:30:33.520
AGGRESSIVE RECYCLED CONTENT

03:30:33.587 --> 03:30:37.024
REQUIREMENTS UNDER AB 793, 25%,

03:30:37.091 --> 03:30:39.193
50%. THOSE ARE THE MOST

03:30:39.259 --> 03:30:42.196
AGGRESSIVE GOALS IN THE COUNTRY,

03:30:42.262 --> 03:30:44.798
AND WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT

03:30:44.865 --> 03:30:46.467
STARTING WITH REPORTING

03:30:46.533 --> 03:30:48.202
REQUIREMENTS, THAT MAY BE

03:30:48.268 --> 03:30:49.937
DIFFICULT FOR THE BOTTLERS TO

03:30:50.004 --> 03:30:51.605
COMPLY WITH, BUT ULTIMATELY MAY

03:30:51.672 --> 03:30:54.341
BE ALSO SETTING UP A CALIFORNIA

03:30:54.408 --> 03:30:55.442
SPECIFIC PURCHASE REQUIREMENT

03:30:55.509 --> 03:30:57.277
WITHOUT REVISITING THE

03:30:57.344 --> 03:30:58.946
AGGRESSIVE GOALS. WE HAVE

03:30:59.013 --> 03:31:01.215
AGGRESSIVE GOALS THAT DID NOT,

03:31:01.281 --> 03:31:03.550
AT THE TIME THEY WERE PUT IN

03:31:03.617 --> 03:31:04.785
PLACE, COME WITH A CALIFORNIA

03:31:04.852 --> 03:31:06.720
PURCHASE REQUIREMENT, AND SO WE

03:31:06.787 --> 03:31:09.289
ARE JUST CONCERNED WITH STEP

03:31:09.356 --> 03:31:11.725
TWO, AND I THINK I HEARD THE

03:31:11.792 --> 03:31:12.493
PROPONENTS SAY WE'RE GOING TO

03:31:12.559 --> 03:31:13.994
START WITH REPORTING, AND WE'RE

03:31:14.061 --> 03:31:15.763
CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THE

03:31:15.829 --> 03:31:17.097
REPORTING IS GOING TO LEAD TO.

03:31:17.164 --> 03:31:19.700
BUT WE DO AGREE WITH MR. ALBIANI

03:31:19.767 --> 03:31:21.335
THAT SOME OF THESE ISSUES CAN BE

03:31:21.402 --> 03:31:23.904
WORKED WITH THROUGH. AND WE

03:31:23.971 --> 03:31:25.239
APPRECIATE THE TIME OF THE

03:31:25.305 --> 03:31:28.876
SENATOR AND THE SPONSORS TO DATE

03:31:28.942 --> 03:31:31.178
AND THE COMMITTEE AS WELL. THANK

03:31:31.245 --> 03:31:33.914
YOU. THANK YOU BOTH. ANY PERSONS

03:31:33.981 --> 03:31:34.848
IN THE HEARING ROOM IN

03:31:34.915 --> 03:31:40.220
OPPOSITION. GOOD EVENING, MISTER

CHAIR MEMBERS. TIM, WITH THE

AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL. I

03:31:43.323 --> 03:31:44.425
JUST WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR

03:31:44.491 --> 03:31:46.260
AND HER STAFF FOR WORKING WITH

03:31:46.326 --> 03:31:46.760
US ON THE CERTIFICATION

03:31:46.827 --> 03:31:48.796
PROVISION OF THE BILL,

03:31:48.862 --> 03:31:49.897
OPTIMISTIC WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

03:31:49.963 --> 03:31:50.731
RESOLUTION OF THAT. SO THANK

03:31:50.798 --> 03:31:54.601
YOU. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR, AND

03:31:54.668 --> 03:31:55.903
MEMBERS AND LÀ AUGUSTINE HERE ON

03:31:55.969 --> 03:31:57.671
BEHALF OF CONSUMER BRANDS

03:31:57.738 --> 03:31:58.906
ASSOCIATION, OPPOSE UNLESS

03:31:58.972 --> 03:32:01.642
AMENDED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO

03:32:01.708 --> 03:32:04.144
MUCH. NOW TURN TO COMMITTEE

03:32:04.211 --> 03:32:08.148
MEMBERS. I SHOULD JUST LOOK THIS

03:32:08.215 --> 03:32:10.784
DIRECTION, MR. ELLIS. SORRY. I'M

03:32:10.851 --> 03:32:12.486
CURIOUS. SORRY. OH, NO. NO, IT'S

03:32:12.553 --> 03:32:14.688
BOTH OF YOU. GO AHEAD. SENATOR.

03:32:14.755 --> 03:32:16.457
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. I HAVE

03:32:16.523 --> 03:32:20.160
A QUESTION. WHEN YOU. I'LL MAKE

03:32:20.227 --> 03:32:22.162
A STATEMENT. WHEN YOU

03:32:22.229 --> 03:32:24.164
MANUFACTURE, YOU MANUFACTURE TO

03:32:24.231 --> 03:32:26.667
A SPEC AND A VERY SERIOUS SPEC.

03:32:26.733 --> 03:32:27.668
IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE DRINKING

03:32:27.734 --> 03:32:30.771
OUT OF A BOTTLE AND THESE

03:32:30.838 --> 03:32:32.306
MANUFACTURERS, US MANUFACTURERS,

03:32:32.372 --> 03:32:36.577
ARE HELD TO A REALLY TIGHT SPEC

03:32:36.643 --> 03:32:39.213
SPECIFICATION IN ALL ASPECTS OF,

03:32:39.279 --> 03:32:40.814
OF PLASTICS AND POLYMERS AND

03:32:40.881 --> 03:32:42.616
COPOLYMERS. WE DON'T NEED TO GO

03:32:42.683 --> 03:32:44.451
THERE. SO THEN WHY I'D LIKE TO

03:32:44.518 --> 03:32:46.320
ASK THE AUTHOR, WHY DO WE NEED

03:32:46.386 --> 03:32:50.891
COUNTRY OF ORIGIN? SURE. SO

03:32:50.958 --> 03:32:52.459
COUNTRY OF ORIGIN IS GOING BACK

03:32:52.526 --> 03:32:55.062
TO THE RECYCLERS THAT WE HAVE IN

03:32:55.129 --> 03:32:56.430
CALIFORNIA AND IN THE UNITED

03:32:56.497 --> 03:32:58.198
STATES AND KEEPING THEM IN

03:32:58.265 --> 03:32:59.433
BUSINESS. THEY'RE GETTING REALLY

03:32:59.500 --> 03:33:01.034
HARD HIT BY THESE IMPORTS THAT

03:33:01.101 --> 03:33:02.803
ARE COMING IN. WE'VE, AS A

03:33:02.870 --> 03:33:04.671
STATE, SAID THAT RECYCLING IS

03:33:04.738 --> 03:33:06.073
GOOD. WE'VE PUT IN PLACES TO

03:33:06.140 --> 03:33:07.608
COLLECT MORE OF THAT MATERIAL

03:33:07.674 --> 03:33:09.076
AND THEN REQUIRE THESE

03:33:09.143 --> 03:33:11.078
MANUFACTURERS TO USE IT. BUT IF

03:33:11.145 --> 03:33:12.613
THAT MATERIAL IS LARGELY COMING

03:33:12.679 --> 03:33:15.149
FROM OVERSEAS, THEN THESE

03:33:15.215 --> 03:33:17.651
RECLAIMERS THAT WE HAVE IN

03:33:17.718 --> 03:33:18.819
CALIFORNIA ARE NOT GOING TO BE

03:33:18.886 --> 03:33:20.854
ABLE TO STAY IN BUSINESS. AND

03:33:20.921 --> 03:33:22.389
WE'VE SEEN THIS HAPPEN. AND SO

03:33:22.456 --> 03:33:23.824
IT'S JUST A WAY FOR US TO START

03:33:23.891 --> 03:33:25.459
COLLECTING INFORMATION ON IS OUR

03:33:25.526 --> 03:33:27.294
ECONOMY ACTUALLY CIRCULAR IN

03:33:27.361 --> 03:33:28.795
CALIFORNIA? ARE THE THINGS THAT

03:33:28.862 --> 03:33:29.830
WE'RE COLLECTING FROM CALIFORNIA

03:33:29.897 --> 03:33:31.798
HOUSEHOLDS GOING BACK INTO THE

03:33:31.865 --> 03:33:33.133
PRODUCTS THAT CALIFORNIANS USE

03:33:33.200 --> 03:33:35.269
EVERY DAY? SORRY, I HAVE A

03:33:35.335 --> 03:33:38.772
DISCONNECT. WHAT? WHY? AGAIN,

03:33:38.839 --> 03:33:40.541
BACK TO COUNTRY OF ORIGIN. WHY

03:33:40.607 --> 03:33:41.875
DOES IT MATTER WHERE IT COMES

03:33:41.942 --> 03:33:45.612
FROM? SO IF WE IF THE BUSINESSES

03:33:45.679 --> 03:33:47.281
THAT ARE IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW

03:33:47.347 --> 03:33:48.749
AREN'T ABLE TO SELL THEIR

03:33:48.815 --> 03:33:50.484
PRODUCTS AND THEN THEY'LL,

03:33:50.551 --> 03:33:51.385
THEY'LL I MEAN, FRANKLY, THEY'LL

03:33:51.451 --> 03:33:53.353
GO OUT OF BUSINESS, IT IS AT THE

03:33:53.420 --> 03:33:55.956
END OF THE DAY, RECYCLING IS A

03:33:56.023 --> 03:33:57.191
BUSINESS. AND SO THEN WE HAVE NO

03:33:57.257 --> 03:33:58.825
CHOICE. WE DON'T HAVE LOCAL

03:33:58.892 --> 03:34:00.460
RECYCLERS TO DO THIS VERY

03:34:00.527 --> 03:34:02.262
IMPORTANT WORK. IT MEANS THAT WE

03:34:02.329 --> 03:34:06.200
ARE POTENTIALLY GOING BACK TO,

03:34:06.266 --> 03:34:07.534
YOU KNOW, SENDING THINGS

03:34:07.601 --> 03:34:08.902
DIFFERENT PLACES TO BE RECYCLED

03:34:08.969 --> 03:34:10.204
RATHER THAN RECYCLED LOCALLY.

03:34:10.270 --> 03:34:12.439
THAT INCREASES CARBON EMISSIONS.

03:34:12.506 --> 03:34:13.540
WE WOULD PREFER THAT THINGS ARE

03:34:13.607 --> 03:34:15.142
BOUGHT LOCALLY SO THAT WE

03:34:15.209 --> 03:34:16.510
DECREASE CARBON EMISSIONS THERE.

03:34:16.577 --> 03:34:17.711
AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED, YOU

03:34:17.778 --> 03:34:18.979
KNOW, IT'S MUCH LESS CARBON

03:34:19.046 --> 03:34:21.281
INTENSIVE TO MOVE MATERIAL FROM

03:34:21.348 --> 03:34:22.950
JUST LOCALLY RECYCLED RATHER

03:34:23.016 --> 03:34:24.551
THAN ALBIANI. HOW WOULD YOU HOW

03:34:24.618 --> 03:34:27.554
WOULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT? WE

03:34:27.621 --> 03:34:29.089
ACTUALLY AGREE WITH TRYING TO

03:34:29.156 --> 03:34:30.457
DEVELOP A CIRCULAR ECONOMY HERE

03:34:30.524 --> 03:34:31.725
IN CALIFORNIA. GET EVERY BOTTLE

03:34:31.792 --> 03:34:33.627
BACK. IT'S ONE OF OUR PROGRAMS.

03:34:33.694 --> 03:34:35.395
THERE ARE THERE ARE WAYS THAT

03:34:35.462 --> 03:34:37.898
ARE ACTUALLY VERY SPECIFICALLY

03:34:37.965 --> 03:34:39.900
DRIVEN TO DO THAT. FOR INSTANCE,

03:34:39.967 --> 03:34:41.168
THERE'S A MARKET DEVELOPMENT

03:34:41.235 --> 03:34:43.337
PAYMENT PROGRAM THAT THAT

03:34:43.403 --> 03:34:45.138
PROVIDES FUNDING TO THE TO THE

03:34:45.205 --> 03:34:46.974
TO THE FOLKS MAKING RECYCLING

03:34:47.040 --> 03:34:49.276
THE PLASTIC ALONG THE WAY.

03:34:49.343 --> 03:34:50.944
THERE'S SUBSIDIES THAT ARE

03:34:51.011 --> 03:34:53.046
PROVIDED AND INVESTMENT PAYMENTS

03:34:53.113 --> 03:34:54.248
FOR FOLKS DOING THAT IN

03:34:54.314 --> 03:34:55.182
CALIFORNIA AND THEN GETTING THAT

03:34:55.249 --> 03:34:58.485
MATERIAL OUT, WE WOULD ENCOURAGE

03:34:58.552 --> 03:35:00.921
AND CURRENTLY ARE HAVING THESE

03:35:00.988 --> 03:35:02.356
CONVERSATIONS AND EXPANDING THAT

03:35:02.422 --> 03:35:03.724
GIVING, YOU KNOW, MAKING THAT A

03:35:03.790 --> 03:35:07.894
BIGGER INVESTMENT INTO THAT

03:35:07.961 --> 03:35:09.529
PROGRAM THAT'S DIRECTLY FOR

03:35:09.596 --> 03:35:11.865
EVERY, YOU KNOW, MOLECULE THEY

03:35:11.932 --> 03:35:13.867
PRODUCE. THEY GET PAID MORE FOR

03:35:13.934 --> 03:35:15.402
THAT. SO THAT THAT ACTUALLY

03:35:15.469 --> 03:35:16.770
ENCOURAGES PRODUCTION HERE IN

03:35:16.837 --> 03:35:18.639
CALIFORNIA. AND THE CIRCULAR

03:35:18.705 --> 03:35:22.542
ECONOMY. SO AGAIN, THAT'S A VERY

03:35:22.609 --> 03:35:25.712
FINITE DEFINED PAYMENT THAT GOES

03:35:25.779 --> 03:35:27.481
TO PRODUCTION OF THE MATERIAL IN

03:35:27.547 --> 03:35:29.383
CALIFORNIA, THIS COUNTRY OF

03:35:29.449 --> 03:35:31.918
ORIGIN, I'M NOT SURE IT'S GOING

03:35:31.985 --> 03:35:35.589
TO RESULT IN THE, YOU KNOW, THE

03:35:35.656 --> 03:35:36.456
INFORMATION THAT THEY WANT. AND

03:35:36.523 --> 03:35:38.859
SO TWO YEARS FROM NOW, THREE

03:35:38.925 --> 03:35:39.660
YEARS FROM NOW, WE GET THIS

03:35:39.726 --> 03:35:41.328
INFORMATION. SO WHAT. AND THAT'S

03:35:41.395 --> 03:35:43.964
A THAT'S HERE I THINK THAT'S

03:35:44.031 --> 03:35:44.665
WHAT MY FRIEND MIGHT BE

03:35:44.731 --> 03:35:46.500
CONCERNED ABOUT. SO WHAT THEN.

03:35:46.566 --> 03:35:48.935
THEN IT LEADS TO SOMETHING ELSE.

03:35:49.002 --> 03:35:50.437
THE THIS MARKET DEVELOPMENT

03:35:50.504 --> 03:35:52.172
PAYMENT INCREASE WHICH WE WOULD

03:35:52.239 --> 03:35:53.840
ENCOURAGE FOR THIS YEAR WOULD

03:35:53.907 --> 03:35:56.009
HELP THESE GUYS SURVIVE RIGHT

03:35:56.076 --> 03:35:58.478
NOW AND HELP PROMOTE MORE

03:35:58.545 --> 03:35:59.913
PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA. SO

03:35:59.980 --> 03:36:01.748
THOSE ARE KIND OF SOME OF THE

03:36:01.815 --> 03:36:03.684
AREAS THAT ARE MORE ARTFULLY

03:36:03.750 --> 03:36:04.818
TAILORED TO GET TO THE GOAL THAT

03:36:04.885 --> 03:36:06.386
I THINK ALL EVERYBODY SUPPORTS.

03:36:06.453 --> 03:36:08.689
THANK YOU. COULD I JUST ADD ONE

03:36:08.755 --> 03:36:10.924
QUICK THING? SO I THINK THE IDEA

03:36:10.991 --> 03:36:12.326
OF AN INCENTIVE PAYMENT OR A

03:36:12.392 --> 03:36:13.994
MARKET DEVELOPMENT PAYMENT, IT

03:36:14.061 --> 03:36:16.196
REALLY WOULD BE A SECOND STEP. I

03:36:16.263 --> 03:36:18.465
THINK WE NEED TO KNOW THE DATA.

03:36:18.532 --> 03:36:20.167
WE DON'T YOU KNOW, THIS IS ALL

03:36:20.233 --> 03:36:22.302
ANECDOTAL, THIS IDEA THAT THAT

03:36:22.369 --> 03:36:24.404
THERE'S THERE ARE THESE REPORTS

03:36:24.471 --> 03:36:26.840
OF, OF NEW PLASTIC THAT COMES IN

03:36:26.907 --> 03:36:28.475
AND THEN IS PELLETIZED AND THEN

03:36:28.542 --> 03:36:30.711
ALL OF A SUDDEN IT'S SUPPOSEDLY

03:36:30.777 --> 03:36:32.045
RECYCLED BECAUSE WHEN IT BECOMES

03:36:32.112 --> 03:36:33.447
PELLETIZED, WE DON'T KNOW THE

03:36:33.513 --> 03:36:35.649
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IF IT CAME

03:36:35.716 --> 03:36:36.683
FROM AN ACTUAL BOTTLE BEFOREHAND

03:36:36.750 --> 03:36:39.486
OR NOT. AND SO FIGURING OUT WHAT

03:36:39.553 --> 03:36:41.822
IS HAPPENING, THAT'S THE TRUST

03:36:41.888 --> 03:36:43.690
BUT VERIFY IDEA, IS THAT WE

03:36:43.757 --> 03:36:44.524
DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT'S

03:36:44.591 --> 03:36:46.093
HAPPENING IN OUR RECYCLING

03:36:46.159 --> 03:36:47.861
MARKET. AND WE WANT TO HAVE THE

03:36:47.928 --> 03:36:49.596
CIRCULAR ECONOMY. WE HAVE

03:36:49.663 --> 03:36:52.532
MANDATES THAT 25% OF THE PLASTIC

03:36:52.599 --> 03:36:54.334
BOTTLE THAT'S CREATED HAS TO BE

03:36:54.401 --> 03:36:56.470
FROM RECYCLED CONTENT. SO

03:36:56.536 --> 03:36:57.938
FIGURING OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IS

03:36:58.004 --> 03:36:59.506
THAT'S THE POINT OF THIS BILL.

03:36:59.573 --> 03:37:01.541
SO TO ME, THE QUESTION OF DO WE

03:37:01.608 --> 03:37:03.343
DO AN INCENTIVE PAYMENT OR SOME

03:37:03.410 --> 03:37:06.279
OTHER STRUCTURE IS JUST IT'S NOT

03:37:06.346 --> 03:37:08.415
PART OF THIS INITIAL THRESHOLD

03:37:08.482 --> 03:37:09.750
QUESTION OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

03:37:09.816 --> 03:37:11.251
CALIFORNIA WITH OUR RECYCLED

03:37:11.318 --> 03:37:13.787
MARKET. AND WE DO HAVE AT LEAST

03:37:13.854 --> 03:37:16.056
ANECDOTAL REPORTS OF A PROBLEM

03:37:16.123 --> 03:37:17.991
THAT THAT WE ARE, THAT THESE

03:37:18.058 --> 03:37:19.626
SHEETS OF PLASTIC THAT'S NEW ARE

03:37:19.693 --> 03:37:21.395
COMING INTO CALIFORNIA BEING

03:37:21.461 --> 03:37:22.763
PELLETIZED AND BEING RECYCLED.

03:37:22.829 --> 03:37:24.564
AND WE'RE JUST TRYING TO GET TO

03:37:24.631 --> 03:37:26.400
THE BOTTOM OF THAT. AND THIS

03:37:26.466 --> 03:37:27.000
THIRD PARTY CERTIFICATION HAS

03:37:27.067 --> 03:37:29.202
WORKED IN OTHER AREAS AND IS,

03:37:29.269 --> 03:37:31.538
YOU KNOW, IT MAKES SENSE OF WHY

03:37:31.605 --> 03:37:32.472
THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT

03:37:32.539 --> 03:37:34.141
WOULD BE REQUIRED. AND WE HAVE

03:37:34.207 --> 03:37:35.375
CONTROL IN CALIFORNIA OVER OUR

03:37:35.442 --> 03:37:36.877
BEVERAGE MANUFACTURERS, BUT WE

03:37:36.943 --> 03:37:38.979
DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER SOME OF

03:37:39.045 --> 03:37:40.380
THESE OTHER LIKE THE RECLAIMERS

03:37:40.447 --> 03:37:41.782
AND THESE OTHERS WHO ARE OUTSIDE

03:37:41.848 --> 03:37:43.650
OF THE COUNTRY OR THE STATE. SO

03:37:43.717 --> 03:37:45.886
THAT'S WHY WE'RE WE'RE DOING IT

03:37:45.952 --> 03:37:50.490
THIS WAY. MR. MURATSUCHI, COULD

03:37:50.557 --> 03:37:54.161
YOU RESPOND TO CALIFORNIANS

03:37:54.227 --> 03:37:58.064
AGAINST WASTE? THERE, THERE

03:37:58.131 --> 03:37:59.900
POSITION OF I MEAN, I I'M

03:37:59.966 --> 03:38:02.002
SURPRISED THAT THEY'RE NOT IN

03:38:02.068 --> 03:38:03.170
SUPPORT OF YOUR BILL. I KNOW

03:38:03.236 --> 03:38:05.772
IT'S DISAPPOINTING. WOULD YOU

03:38:05.839 --> 03:38:07.541
LIKE TO RESPOND? SURE. SO WE'VE

03:38:07.607 --> 03:38:10.744
DONE A LOT OF WORK ON HOW TO PUT

03:38:10.811 --> 03:38:13.180
THE REQUIREMENT FOR THIRD PARTY

03:38:13.246 --> 03:38:14.347
CERTIFICATION IN THE BILL. AND

03:38:14.414 --> 03:38:15.515
PART OF THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS

03:38:15.582 --> 03:38:17.684
WILL MOVE. THIS WILL REMOVE THE

03:38:17.751 --> 03:38:19.586
WHAT'S CALLED ISO CODES FROM THE

03:38:19.653 --> 03:38:21.054
BILL. THOSE WERE ORIGINALLY PUT

03:38:21.121 --> 03:38:22.656
IN A COUPLE OF COMMITTEES AGO.

03:38:22.722 --> 03:38:23.557
AND WHAT WE FOUND IN DOING THAT

03:38:23.623 --> 03:38:26.560
IS WE WERE TRYING TO PUT

03:38:26.626 --> 03:38:27.194
PARAMETERS ON THIS PROCESS. BUT

03:38:27.260 --> 03:38:28.361
THESE ARE VERY SPECIFIC CODES,

03:38:28.428 --> 03:38:30.130
VERY COMPLICATED. THEY'RE HARD

03:38:30.197 --> 03:38:31.965
TO EVEN ACCESS. YOU HAVE TO PAY

03:38:32.032 --> 03:38:33.567
TO ACCESS THEM. AND THE WAY THEY

03:38:33.633 --> 03:38:34.835
WERE PUT INTO THE BILL WAS

03:38:34.901 --> 03:38:37.037
PARSED A BIT INCORRECTLY. BUT

03:38:37.103 --> 03:38:38.004
WE'RE WE'RE GOING BACK TO

03:38:38.071 --> 03:38:39.239
LANGUAGE THAT SIMPLY REFERENCES

03:38:39.306 --> 03:38:41.541
WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE ON STATUTE

03:38:41.608 --> 03:38:42.976
REGARDING THIRD PARTY

03:38:43.043 --> 03:38:45.445
CERTIFICATION FOR PLASTIC. AND

03:38:45.512 --> 03:38:49.182
SO THAT WILL GO TO IN APRIL, IS

03:38:49.249 --> 03:38:50.550
ONE OF THE COMPANIES THAT HAVE

03:38:50.617 --> 03:38:52.252
REFERENCES THAT HAS A STANDARD

03:38:52.319 --> 03:38:53.453
FOR THIRD PARTY CERTIFICATION

03:38:53.520 --> 03:38:55.789
AND WILL REQUIRE THAT OR SIMILAR

03:38:55.856 --> 03:38:58.525
IN SOME OF THESE ISO CODES ARE

03:38:58.592 --> 03:38:59.926
CONTAINED IN THE STANDARDS THAT

03:38:59.993 --> 03:39:01.461
ALREADY EXIST, OR THAT THE THIRD

03:39:01.528 --> 03:39:02.662
PARTY CERTIFICATION THAT ALREADY

03:39:02.729 --> 03:39:04.364
EXIST RIGHT NOW. SO IT'S NOT

03:39:04.431 --> 03:39:05.732
COMPLETELY REMOVING THEM FROM

03:39:05.799 --> 03:39:07.267
THE POLICY, BUT THEY WILL NO

03:39:07.334 --> 03:39:07.934
LONGER BE SPECIFICALLY SPECIFIED

03:39:08.001 --> 03:39:10.470
IN THE BILL BECAUSE THAT WAS IN

03:39:10.537 --> 03:39:12.672
AN INCORRECT WAY TO REFERENCE

03:39:12.739 --> 03:39:15.775
IT. SO IT SOUNDS COMPLICATED. I

03:39:15.842 --> 03:39:17.978
THINK I HEARD YOU SAY IT'S

03:39:18.044 --> 03:39:20.881
EXPENSIVE. AND WHO IS GOING TO

03:39:20.947 --> 03:39:23.383
VERIFY THAT THE BEVERAGE

03:39:23.450 --> 03:39:24.351
MANUFACTURERS REPORTING IS

03:39:24.417 --> 03:39:26.953
ACTUALLY ACCURATE? SO IT

03:39:27.020 --> 03:39:28.855
DELEGATES RESPONSIBILITY TO

03:39:28.922 --> 03:39:30.423
CALRECYCLE WHO WILL WHO WILL

03:39:30.490 --> 03:39:31.424
MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A

03:39:31.491 --> 03:39:33.393
STANDARD SET FOR IT, WILL

03:39:33.460 --> 03:39:35.662
REFERENCE ÁP ARE SIMILAR AS IS

03:39:35.729 --> 03:39:37.497
ALREADY IN STATUTE. CALRECYCLE

03:39:37.564 --> 03:39:38.498
DETERMINES WHAT STANDARD THAT

03:39:38.565 --> 03:39:40.700
IS. AND THEN BEVERAGE CONTAINER

03:39:40.767 --> 03:39:42.068
MANUFACTURERS REPORT TO RECYCLE.

03:39:42.135 --> 03:39:43.370
THEY'LL DETERMINE THE STANDARD

03:39:43.436 --> 03:39:45.672
WHO'S GOING TO VERIFY WHERE THE

03:39:45.739 --> 03:39:47.841
ACTUAL COUNTRY OF ORIGIN IS. SO

03:39:47.908 --> 03:39:50.310
THEN THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN

03:39:50.377 --> 03:39:51.845
REPORTING IS SEPARATE FROM THE

03:39:51.912 --> 03:39:54.214
THIRD PARTY CERTIFICATION IN

03:39:54.281 --> 03:39:56.149
THAT. AND THAT WILL JUST BE

03:39:56.216 --> 03:39:58.184
REPORTED DIRECTLY TO CALRECYCLE

03:39:58.251 --> 03:39:59.319
BY THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER. HOW

03:39:59.386 --> 03:40:01.755
DO YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S TRUE

03:40:01.821 --> 03:40:03.590
INFORMATION. SO WE DON'T HAVE

03:40:03.657 --> 03:40:05.559
ANYTHING IN THE BILL RIGHT NOW.

03:40:05.625 --> 03:40:10.564
THAT 100% CERTIFIES THAT. SO

03:40:10.630 --> 03:40:13.033
COULD I ANSWER. SO THE BILL

03:40:13.099 --> 03:40:14.834
DIRECTLY AFFECTS THE BEVERAGE

03:40:14.901 --> 03:40:15.902
MANUFACTURERS BY REQUIRING THEM

03:40:15.969 --> 03:40:17.337
TO OBTAIN REPORTS FROM THE

03:40:17.404 --> 03:40:20.941
RECLAIMERS. SO, SO THAT'S THE

03:40:21.007 --> 03:40:22.776
AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE

03:40:22.842 --> 03:40:24.878
RECLAIMERS ARE ONES THAT THAT WE

03:40:24.945 --> 03:40:26.746
ARE ABLE TO HAVE SOME AUTHORITY

03:40:26.813 --> 03:40:28.782
OVER REGULATORY AUTHORITY. SO

03:40:28.848 --> 03:40:30.784
THAT'S AND I MEAN THIS IS LIKE

03:40:30.850 --> 03:40:32.852
IT'S LIKE THE DOCTOR SEUSS BOOK

03:40:32.919 --> 03:40:33.520
OF THE BEE WATCHER. WATCHER.

03:40:33.587 --> 03:40:35.488
LIKE YOU KNOW, WE'RE WE'RE NOT

03:40:35.555 --> 03:40:36.957
WE'RE NOT THINKING THAT THIRD

03:40:37.023 --> 03:40:37.791
PARTY CERTIFICATION IS GOING TO

03:40:37.857 --> 03:40:39.659
BE FALSE. AND SO WE WANT SOMEONE

03:40:39.726 --> 03:40:40.827
TO WATCH THE THIRD PARTY

03:40:40.894 --> 03:40:43.129
CERTIFICATION. THE THIRD PARTY

03:40:43.196 --> 03:40:43.697
CERTIFICATION IS MEANT TO

03:40:43.763 --> 03:40:44.364
DETERMINE EXACTLY WHERE THIS IS

03:40:44.431 --> 03:40:46.466
COMING FROM. AND THE DATA WILL

03:40:46.533 --> 03:40:48.168
BE. THERE WAS CONCERN ABOUT

03:40:48.234 --> 03:40:50.170
ABOUT A COMPETITIVE TRADE

03:40:50.236 --> 03:40:52.238
SECRETS ISSUE. SO THE DATA WILL

03:40:52.305 --> 03:40:53.740
BE AGGREGATED. SO IT WON'T

03:40:53.807 --> 03:40:56.309
ACTUALLY BE CLEAR WHAT SPECIFIC

03:40:56.376 --> 03:40:57.277
MANUFACTURER IS GETTING THEIR

03:40:57.344 --> 03:40:59.479
PLASTIC FROM WHICH SPECIFIC

03:40:59.546 --> 03:41:01.781
PLACE. BECAUSE OF A CONCERN

03:41:01.848 --> 03:41:04.718
ABOUT TRADE SECRETS. YES. AND IF

03:41:04.784 --> 03:41:07.387
I MIGHT ADD, SO CALRECYCLE HAS

03:41:07.454 --> 03:41:09.522
THE AUTHORITY TO DO AUDITS HERE.

03:41:09.589 --> 03:41:10.957
AND THEN THEY'RE REPORTING UNDER

03:41:11.024 --> 03:41:13.326
PENALTY OF PERJURY. BUT JUST TO

03:41:13.393 --> 03:41:15.428
BE CLEAR THAT THE COUNTRY OF

03:41:15.495 --> 03:41:16.496
ORIGIN IS SEPARATE THAN THE

03:41:16.563 --> 03:41:17.597
THIRD PARTY SOURCE. SO THAT'S

03:41:17.664 --> 03:41:19.299
WHAT I WAS TRYING TO PARSE OUT

03:41:19.366 --> 03:41:20.600
FOR YOU. BUT THERE THERE IS.

03:41:20.667 --> 03:41:22.202
YEAH, IT'S SEPARATE THAN THE

03:41:22.268 --> 03:41:22.836
THIRD PARTY CERTIFICATION. BUT

03:41:22.902 --> 03:41:24.571
THEN CALRECYCLE HAS AUTHORITY TO

03:41:24.638 --> 03:41:26.039
CHECK THESE THINGS. I DON'T

03:41:26.106 --> 03:41:28.375
KNOW, I MEAN, I MEAN, I RESPECT,

03:41:28.441 --> 03:41:30.210
SENATOR, YOUR WORK IN THE SPACE.

03:41:30.276 --> 03:41:32.545
AND SO I'LL, I'LL VOTE TO, YOU

03:41:32.612 --> 03:41:34.347
KNOW, SO THAT YOU CAN CONTINUE

03:41:34.414 --> 03:41:36.650
THE WORK. BUT I IT DOESN'T SOUND

03:41:36.716 --> 03:41:40.820
LIKE YOU GOT HOW THIS IS ALL

03:41:40.887 --> 03:41:42.622
GOING TO, YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY

03:41:42.689 --> 03:41:46.626
WORK. I MEAN, LIKE. RELYING ON

03:41:46.693 --> 03:41:49.229
RECLAIMERS TO REPORT ON THE, ON

03:41:49.295 --> 03:41:51.364
THE, THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN AND

03:41:51.431 --> 03:41:54.901
HOW THAT'S GOING TO HELP KEEP

03:41:54.968 --> 03:41:58.138
RECYCLING LOCAL. I MEAN, I

03:41:58.204 --> 03:42:01.107
SUPPORT THE, THE GOAL OF, YOU

03:42:01.174 --> 03:42:05.011
KNOW, NOT HAVING TO EXPORT STUFF

03:42:05.078 --> 03:42:08.281
AND ADD TO GLOBAL EMISSIONS, BUT

03:42:08.348 --> 03:42:10.083
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE, YOU KNOW,

03:42:10.150 --> 03:42:12.519
WITHOUT WITHOUT HAVING SOMEONE

03:42:12.585 --> 03:42:14.587
IN CHARGE OF VERIFYING THE

03:42:14.654 --> 03:42:16.890
REPORTING, THEN IT JUST SEEMS

03:42:16.956 --> 03:42:19.993
LIKE IT'S A I QUESTION THE

03:42:20.060 --> 03:42:21.027
INTEGRITY OF THE INFORMATION

03:42:21.094 --> 03:42:25.265
ANYWAY. OKAY. THANK YOU, MR.

03:42:25.331 --> 03:42:27.233
MAYOR. THANK YOU, MR. BURR. SO I

03:42:27.300 --> 03:42:30.937
HAD SORT OF SIMILAR CONCERNS. I,

03:42:31.004 --> 03:42:32.906
I THINK THE GOAL OF THE BILL IS,

03:42:32.972 --> 03:42:37.110
IS LAUDABLE. AND I APPLAUD YOU

03:42:37.177 --> 03:42:38.078
FOR TRYING TO GET YOUR ARMS

03:42:38.144 --> 03:42:40.513
AROUND THIS AND UNDERSTAND THE

03:42:40.580 --> 03:42:44.050
NEED FOR MORE DATA. I GUESS I

03:42:44.117 --> 03:42:45.819
WAS SORT OF TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

03:42:45.885 --> 03:42:48.488
SORT OF WHAT THE SORT OF CHAIN

03:42:48.555 --> 03:42:51.424
OF CUSTODY IS OF THIS, THE

03:42:51.491 --> 03:42:54.060
RECYCLED PLASTIC. AND ONE OF THE

03:42:54.127 --> 03:42:57.497
THINGS THAT RESONATED FOR ME IN

03:42:57.564 --> 03:42:59.399
THE OPPOSITION LETTER WAS JUST

03:42:59.466 --> 03:43:04.370
WHETHER OR NOT THE. THE

03:43:04.437 --> 03:43:06.239
OBLIGATIONS, THE VERIFICATION

03:43:06.306 --> 03:43:07.574
OBLIGATIONS, WHETHER THEY WERE

03:43:07.640 --> 03:43:09.375
MISPLACED. SO WHY WOULD YOU PUT

03:43:09.442 --> 03:43:11.711
THEM ON THE BEVERAGE

03:43:11.778 --> 03:43:13.413
MANUFACTURER WHEN THEY'RE NOT

03:43:13.480 --> 03:43:16.483
GOING TO KNOW WHETHER, WHERE,

03:43:16.549 --> 03:43:17.817
WHERE IT CAME FROM AND WHETHER

03:43:17.884 --> 03:43:19.953
OR NOT ISN'T THE TWO ISSUES,

03:43:20.019 --> 03:43:21.321
WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS ACTUALLY

03:43:21.387 --> 03:43:22.622
RECYCLED BEADS. AND THEN THE

03:43:22.689 --> 03:43:23.590
SECOND WHERE IT'S COMING FROM IS

03:43:23.656 --> 03:43:25.625
THOSE THE TWO GOALS OF THE BILL.

03:43:25.692 --> 03:43:27.694
RIGHT. IS THAT RIGHT? YES. SO

03:43:27.761 --> 03:43:28.495
I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU'VE

03:43:28.561 --> 03:43:29.929
THOUGHT THROUGH LIKE WHY, HOW

03:43:29.996 --> 03:43:32.065
WHY WOULD HOW WOULD THE BEVERAGE

03:43:32.132 --> 03:43:34.267
MANUFACTURERS KNOW WHETHER

03:43:34.334 --> 03:43:37.137
SOMEONE IS LYING TO THEM AND

03:43:37.203 --> 03:43:39.372
WHY. YOU KNOW, I MEAN, WELL, SO

03:43:39.439 --> 03:43:40.807
BASICALLY THEY'RE BUYING THROUGH

03:43:40.874 --> 03:43:43.009
THE CHAIR, IF YOU DON'T MIND ME

03:43:43.076 --> 03:43:43.943
ANSWERING DIRECTLY. SO THEY'RE

03:43:44.010 --> 03:43:46.479
THE RECLAIMERS THE BEVERAGE

03:43:46.546 --> 03:43:47.280
MANUFACTURER IS BUYING IT FROM

03:43:47.347 --> 03:43:49.616
THE RECLAIMER. AND SO THEY'RE

03:43:49.682 --> 03:43:51.184
GOING TO ASK THE RECLAIMER TO

03:43:51.251 --> 03:43:53.787
SAY, WHERE DID YOU GET THIS? AND

03:43:53.853 --> 03:43:56.990
THEN IT WHAT COUNTRY DID IT COME

03:43:57.056 --> 03:43:58.758
FROM. AND THAT DATA. SO THE

03:43:58.825 --> 03:43:59.759
RECLAIMERS WILL NEED TO PROVIDE

03:43:59.826 --> 03:44:00.927
THAT BECAUSE IT'S THE

03:44:00.994 --> 03:44:02.896
MANUFACTURERS REQUIRE IT. WELL

03:44:02.962 --> 03:44:04.898
WHY WOULDN'T WE IMPOSE THE

03:44:04.964 --> 03:44:07.767
OBLIGATION ON THE RECLAIMER IF I

03:44:07.834 --> 03:44:09.869
CAN JUMP IN HERE. SO UNDER THE

03:44:09.936 --> 03:44:11.337
CURRENT LAW, BEVERAGE CONTAINER

03:44:11.404 --> 03:44:12.438
MANUFACTURERS ARE ALREADY

03:44:12.505 --> 03:44:14.941
REPORTING INFORMATION ON THE

03:44:15.008 --> 03:44:16.276
AMOUNT UNDER THE CURRENT LAW,

03:44:16.342 --> 03:44:17.644
YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE TO MEET

03:44:17.710 --> 03:44:18.878
THESE PERCENTAGES OF

03:44:18.945 --> 03:44:19.679
POST-CONSUMER RECYCLED CONTENT.

03:44:19.746 --> 03:44:22.448
SO THIS IS FOR IN LARGE PART

03:44:22.515 --> 03:44:23.750
SIMPLICITY'S SAKE ADDING THEM AS

03:44:23.817 --> 03:44:25.752
THE REPORTER. FOR THIS, IT CUTS

03:44:25.819 --> 03:44:26.619
DOWN THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN

03:44:26.686 --> 03:44:28.288
ON CALRECYCLE. WE THINK IT'S A

03:44:28.354 --> 03:44:30.456
VERY SMOOTH WAY TO DO IT. AND

03:44:30.523 --> 03:44:32.358
YOU KNOW, THESE THESE BEVERAGE

03:44:32.425 --> 03:44:33.259
MANUFACTURERS ARE ALREADY GOING

03:44:33.326 --> 03:44:35.094
TO THEIR SUPPLIERS AND ASKING

03:44:35.161 --> 03:44:36.296
FOR, YOU KNOW, WHATEVER

03:44:36.362 --> 03:44:37.430
PERCENTAGE OF POST-CONSUMER

03:44:37.497 --> 03:44:39.098
RECYCLED CONTENT THEY THEY NEED.

03:44:39.165 --> 03:44:40.667
WE THINK IT'S A VERY SIMILAR

03:44:40.733 --> 03:44:42.368
PROCESS FOR THESE TYPES OF THIS

03:44:42.435 --> 03:44:43.436
INFORMATION THAT THEY NEWLY BE

03:44:43.503 --> 03:44:45.271
REPORTING UNDER THIS BILL. I

03:44:45.338 --> 03:44:46.739
GUESS WHAT I'M NERVOUS ABOUT IS

03:44:46.806 --> 03:44:49.242
THAT WHAT THIS DOES IS IT

03:44:49.309 --> 03:44:50.677
CREATES A PAPER TRAIL WHERE A

03:44:50.743 --> 03:44:51.544
BEVERAGE MANUFACTURER IS NOT

03:44:51.611 --> 03:44:53.112
GOING TO BUY ANYTHING UNLESS

03:44:53.179 --> 03:44:55.315
THERE'S A PAPERWORK THAT SAYS

03:44:55.381 --> 03:44:57.083
THAT THIS IS RECYCLED AND IT

03:44:57.150 --> 03:44:59.319
CAME FROM SOME COUNTRY, THEY'RE

03:44:59.385 --> 03:45:00.453
GOING TO HAVE TO GO TO THE

03:45:00.520 --> 03:45:01.487
RECLAIMERS TO GET THAT

03:45:01.554 --> 03:45:02.822
INFORMATION. AND THEN, OF

03:45:02.889 --> 03:45:04.591
COURSE, THE RECLAIMERS CAN LIE

03:45:04.657 --> 03:45:05.458
AND THERE'S NO LIABILITY TO THE

03:45:05.525 --> 03:45:07.460
RECLAIMERS LYING. SO THAT'S THE

03:45:07.527 --> 03:45:08.661
CONCERN I HAVE. IT'S NOT THAT

03:45:08.728 --> 03:45:10.830
THE GOALS ARE BAD. I THINK THE

03:45:10.897 --> 03:45:12.866
GOALS ARE GOOD, BUT IT JUST

03:45:12.932 --> 03:45:15.168
SEEMS I MEAN, IT JUST I'M JUST

03:45:15.235 --> 03:45:17.670
WONDERING WHETHER THE REPORTING

03:45:17.737 --> 03:45:20.173
OBLIGATIONS AND THE LIABILITY

03:45:20.240 --> 03:45:21.674
FOR INCORRECT REPORTING IS

03:45:21.741 --> 03:45:22.709
MISPLACED IN THE BILL. AND

03:45:22.775 --> 03:45:24.878
THAT'S I'M GOING TO SUPPORT IT

03:45:24.944 --> 03:45:26.546
TODAY. BUT I ASK YOU TO THINK

03:45:26.613 --> 03:45:29.115
ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T

03:45:29.182 --> 03:45:31.217
SEEM TO BE FAIR TO BASICALLY PUT

03:45:31.284 --> 03:45:32.518
THE OBLIGATION ON THE BEVERAGE

03:45:32.585 --> 03:45:33.553
MANUFACTURERS IF THEY DON'T

03:45:33.620 --> 03:45:36.723
KNOW. AND ALL IT SEEMS TO ME IS

03:45:36.789 --> 03:45:38.925
THAT WHAT THAT WILL RESULT IN

03:45:38.992 --> 03:45:40.660
THEM DOING IS REQUIRING

03:45:40.727 --> 03:45:42.028
PAPERWORK THAT SAYS IT WAS

03:45:42.095 --> 03:45:43.229
REPORTED OR THAT IT CAME FROM

03:45:43.296 --> 03:45:45.665
SOME COUNTRY, BUT THEN THAT

03:45:45.732 --> 03:45:47.467
COULD BE MADE UP AND THERE'S NO

03:45:47.533 --> 03:45:48.334
LIABILITY ON THE RECLAIMERS AT

03:45:48.401 --> 03:45:50.670
ALL TO NOT DO THAT. SO YEAH, I

03:45:50.737 --> 03:45:52.672
MEAN, IT REALLY GOES BACK TO WHO

03:45:52.739 --> 03:45:55.074
DO WE HAVE AUTHORITY OVER. SO WE

03:45:55.141 --> 03:45:56.910
DO HAVE REGULAR REGULATORY

03:45:56.976 --> 03:45:58.678
AUTHORITY OVER THE BEVERAGE

03:45:58.745 --> 03:45:59.379
MANUFACTURERS. AND THEY ARE

03:45:59.445 --> 03:46:01.281
REPORTING UNDER PENALTY OF

03:46:01.347 --> 03:46:02.715
PERJURY. AND I MEAN THERE'S

03:46:02.782 --> 03:46:04.450
OBVIOUSLY IN ANY ANYWHERE

03:46:04.517 --> 03:46:06.552
THERE'S THE POSSIBILITY OF FRAUD

03:46:06.619 --> 03:46:08.755
THAT THAT DOCUMENTATION IS BEING

03:46:08.821 --> 03:46:11.157
FABRICATED. AND I MEAN, THERE IS

03:46:11.224 --> 03:46:12.558
A PROCESS FOR, FOR FOLLOWING UP

03:46:12.625 --> 03:46:14.861
ON THAT IF THAT'S HAPPENING.

03:46:14.928 --> 03:46:16.496
BUT, BUT BUT AS WAS EXPLAINED,

03:46:16.562 --> 03:46:17.764
BECAUSE THERE'S ALREADY

03:46:17.830 --> 03:46:18.865
INFORMATION THAT'S BEING

03:46:18.932 --> 03:46:20.300
REPORTED AND IT ALLOWS

03:46:20.366 --> 03:46:21.668
CALRECYCLE TO ADD THIS BASICALLY

03:46:21.734 --> 03:46:24.637
AS A JUST A SMALL ADDITION AND

03:46:24.704 --> 03:46:27.106
WILL ALLOW US AS A STATE TO HAVE

03:46:27.173 --> 03:46:29.175
AN INSIGHT INTO WHAT'S HAPPENING

03:46:29.242 --> 03:46:30.777
HERE WHEN WE MAKE WHEN WE HAVE

03:46:30.843 --> 03:46:32.345
THESE REQUIREMENTS OF 25%

03:46:32.412 --> 03:46:34.647
RECYCLED CONTENT OR 50% RECYCLED

03:46:34.714 --> 03:46:37.150
CONTENT, THEN WE NEED THOSE WHO

03:46:37.216 --> 03:46:38.618
PRODUCE THOSE BOTTLES TO BE

03:46:38.685 --> 03:46:40.320
TELLING US WHERE THEY'RE GETTING

03:46:40.386 --> 03:46:42.221
IT FROM AND WHETHER WHETHER IT'S

03:46:42.288 --> 03:46:42.956
RECYCLED AND WHERE IT'S COMING

03:46:43.022 --> 03:46:45.491
FROM. I GUESS WHAT I'M SORT OF

03:46:45.558 --> 03:46:46.759
GETTING BACK IS IF THEY DON'T

03:46:46.826 --> 03:46:48.461
KNOW THAT AND THEY HAVE TO RELY

03:46:48.528 --> 03:46:51.597
ON SOMEONE ELSE TO GET THAT, IS

03:46:51.664 --> 03:46:55.068
IT APPROPRIATE TO ASSIGN

03:46:55.134 --> 03:46:56.235
LIABILITY TO THAT CIRCUMSTANCE

03:46:56.302 --> 03:46:58.705
WHEN THEY THEY CAN ASK ALL THE

03:46:58.771 --> 03:47:01.174
RIGHT QUESTIONS IF SOMEONE LIES

03:47:01.240 --> 03:47:04.243
TO THEM? ANYWAY, I THINK YOU GOT

03:47:04.310 --> 03:47:06.279
THE POINT. I'M GOING TO SUPPORT

03:47:06.346 --> 03:47:07.747
IT TODAY, BUT I THINK I

03:47:07.814 --> 03:47:09.248
ENCOURAGE YOU TO WORK WITH THE

03:47:09.315 --> 03:47:10.149
OPPOSITION AND THINK THROUGH

03:47:10.216 --> 03:47:12.752
WHETHER THE REPORTING OBLIGATION

03:47:12.819 --> 03:47:14.354
IS PLACED IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND

03:47:14.420 --> 03:47:16.823
THE LIABILITY. YEAH, OKAY. I

03:47:16.889 --> 03:47:18.891
MEAN, THE, THE, THE RECLAIMERS,

03:47:18.958 --> 03:47:20.426
YOU KNOW, THEY CAN BE LOCATED

03:47:20.493 --> 03:47:22.528
GLOBALLY AND THE AND THE

03:47:22.595 --> 03:47:23.196
MANUFACTURERS ARE DOING BUSINESS

03:47:23.262 --> 03:47:24.697
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO

03:47:24.764 --> 03:47:26.866
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS IN

03:47:26.933 --> 03:47:27.934
DIRECT RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM.

03:47:28.001 --> 03:47:30.236
AND SO HAVING THEM HAVE THE

03:47:30.303 --> 03:47:31.571
REQUIREMENTS AND THEM NEEDING TO

03:47:31.637 --> 03:47:32.638
ENSURE THAT THEY'RE ACCURATE,

03:47:32.705 --> 03:47:33.740
YOU KNOW, THAT DOESN'T SEEM

03:47:33.806 --> 03:47:35.408
DIFFERENT FROM THE WAY WE DO A

03:47:35.475 --> 03:47:37.744
LOT OF THINGS. AND I MEAN, I

03:47:37.810 --> 03:47:39.178
EVEN IF YOU THINK ABOUT SB 1383,

03:47:39.245 --> 03:47:42.081
WHICH IS OUR, OUR COMPOSTING AND

03:47:42.148 --> 03:47:44.083
WASTE REDUCTION AROUND REDUCING

03:47:44.150 --> 03:47:45.651
THE AMOUNT OF GREEN WASTE IN

03:47:45.718 --> 03:47:46.686
LANDFILLS, THE OBLIGATION FALLS

03:47:46.753 --> 03:47:48.488
TO THE CITIES, BUT THEY RELY ON

03:47:48.554 --> 03:47:50.356
THE WASTE HAULERS TO TELL THEM,

03:47:50.423 --> 03:47:52.191
WHAT WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT

03:47:52.258 --> 03:47:53.526
ARE YOU DOING TO DIVERT WHAT

03:47:53.593 --> 03:47:54.861
WHAT HOW MUCH? YOU KNOW, A WASTE

03:47:54.927 --> 03:47:56.529
AUDIT. ALL THE THINGS ARE COMING

03:47:56.596 --> 03:47:58.531
FROM THE WASTE HAULERS. BUT IT'S

03:47:58.598 --> 03:47:59.599
THE CITY'S OBLIGATION. AND IN

03:47:59.665 --> 03:48:01.534
MANY WAYS, I MEAN, TO ME IT DOES

03:48:01.601 --> 03:48:03.169
SEEM LIKE IT'S ACCURATELY OR

03:48:03.236 --> 03:48:05.304
IT'S EFFECTIVE AT THE BEVERAGE

03:48:05.371 --> 03:48:07.407
MANUFACTURER LEVEL BECAUSE

03:48:07.473 --> 03:48:08.474
THEY'RE THE ONES DOING BUSINESS

03:48:08.541 --> 03:48:10.710
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ARE

03:48:10.777 --> 03:48:12.278
THERE CRIMINAL PENALTIES RELATED

03:48:12.345 --> 03:48:15.748
TO THIS OR CIVIL? IT'S UNDER

03:48:15.815 --> 03:48:17.617
PENALTY OF PERJURY. SO FORGIVE

03:48:17.683 --> 03:48:19.218
ME THAT AT THIS MOMENT, I'M NOT

03:48:19.285 --> 03:48:20.853
A LAWYER AND I DON'T WANT TO

03:48:20.920 --> 03:48:21.988
ANSWER INCORRECTLY, BUT IT'S

03:48:22.055 --> 03:48:23.723
PROBABLY NOT CRIMINAL. I MEAN, I

03:48:23.790 --> 03:48:25.491
DON'T KNOW, BUT I'D BE

03:48:25.558 --> 03:48:26.259
SURPRISED. YEAH, I'M NOT GOING

03:48:26.325 --> 03:48:28.394
TO GO ON. I'M NERVOUS ABOUT, YOU

03:48:28.461 --> 03:48:31.364
KNOW, USUALLY YOU IMPOSE

03:48:31.431 --> 03:48:32.732
OBLIGATIONS ON THE ENTITY THAT

03:48:32.799 --> 03:48:34.567
HAS CONTROL OVER THE ACTIVITY.

03:48:34.634 --> 03:48:37.737
AND I JUST I JUST DON'T THINK

03:48:37.804 --> 03:48:41.507
THAT'S AT THAT PLACE. SO. BUT

03:48:41.574 --> 03:48:43.810
I'LL SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. SO

03:48:43.876 --> 03:48:44.444
THANK YOU OKAY. THANK YOU. ANY

03:48:44.510 --> 03:48:49.348
OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS

03:48:49.415 --> 03:48:50.983
SENATOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE?

03:48:51.050 --> 03:48:52.151
I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR

03:48:52.218 --> 03:48:56.055
VOTE. THANK YOU. WE HAVE A

03:48:56.122 --> 03:48:59.258
MOTION. MOTION BY MR. SCHULTZ,

03:48:59.325 --> 03:49:02.295
SECOND BY MR. CARILLO. IMPORTANT

03:49:02.361 --> 03:49:03.796
TO NOTE THAT UNDER 793 CURRENTLY

03:49:03.863 --> 03:49:05.598
A LOT OF THE REPORTING, AS HAS

03:49:05.665 --> 03:49:08.134
BEEN MENTIONED, IS DONE BY THE

03:49:08.201 --> 03:49:08.768
BEVERAGE ASSOCIATION OR BY THE

03:49:08.835 --> 03:49:10.369
BEVERAGE MANUFACTURERS. I SHOULD

03:49:10.436 --> 03:49:12.772
SAY THERE'S NO REPORTING

03:49:12.839 --> 03:49:14.173
REQUIREMENTS ON THE BOTTLERS

03:49:14.240 --> 03:49:15.908
CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA AT ALL.

03:49:15.975 --> 03:49:17.410
THAT DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T THINK

03:49:17.477 --> 03:49:18.411
THESE CONVERSATIONS SHOULD

03:49:18.478 --> 03:49:20.079
CONTINUE TO TAKE PLACE. WE TRIED

03:49:20.146 --> 03:49:20.646
TO ENCOURAGE THAT DIALOG. I

03:49:20.713 --> 03:49:22.949
THINK WE'RE AT A SPOT WHERE

03:49:23.015 --> 03:49:23.816
NOBODY'S FULLY HAPPY, WHICH TO

03:49:23.883 --> 03:49:25.585
ME IS MY FAVORITE WAY TO MOVE IT

03:49:25.651 --> 03:49:27.220
THROUGH COMMITTEE, BECAUSE I

03:49:27.286 --> 03:49:28.821
BECAUSE WE'VE TRIED TO ENGAGE

03:49:28.888 --> 03:49:30.823
AND BRING FOLKS AS FAR ALONG AS

03:49:30.890 --> 03:49:32.191
POSSIBLE. AND THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN

03:49:32.258 --> 03:49:33.025
SOME OF MR. MURATSUCHI EARLIER

03:49:33.092 --> 03:49:34.460
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY ALL OF YOUR

03:49:34.527 --> 03:49:35.728
FRIENDS AREN'T HERE AS WELL. I

03:49:35.795 --> 03:49:36.529
THINK WE'RE TRYING TO STRIKE

03:49:36.596 --> 03:49:38.831
IMPORTANT BALANCES, AND THAT'S

03:49:38.898 --> 03:49:40.733
THE ROLE OF GOOD POLICYMAKING.

03:49:40.800 --> 03:49:42.001
WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND.

03:49:42.068 --> 03:49:43.336
THIS BILL ENJOYS A DUE PASS

03:49:43.402 --> 03:49:44.637

CHAIR. AND MEMBERS, I WOULD LIKE

03:50:56.876 --> 03:50:58.811
TO FIRST LET ME THANK THE

03:50:58.878 --> 03:51:00.012

03:51:02.615 --> 03:51:05.117
TODAY I'M HERE TO PRESENT SB 298

03:51:05.184 --> 03:51:06.152
TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA

03:51:06.219 --> 03:51:08.221
SEAPORTS REMAIN OPERATIONAL AND

03:51:08.287 --> 03:51:10.022
COMPETITIVE, AND THAT THEY MEET

03:51:10.089 --> 03:51:11.123
CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE AND AIR

03:51:11.190 --> 03:51:13.125
QUALITY GOALS. CALIFORNIA HAS

03:51:13.192 --> 03:51:14.827
LONG BEEN A LEADER IN CLIMATE

03:51:14.894 --> 03:51:16.495
SOLUTIONS, YET WE LACK A CLEAR

03:51:16.562 --> 03:51:18.130
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK TO

03:51:18.197 --> 03:51:19.465
TRANSITION THE MARITIME INDUSTRY

03:51:19.532 --> 03:51:22.201
AWAY FROM DIESEL DEPENDANCE. SB

03:51:22.268 --> 03:51:24.670
298 BEGINS TO FILL THIS GAP.

03:51:24.737 --> 03:51:26.639
CALIFORNIA PORTS HANDLE 60% OF

03:51:26.706 --> 03:51:28.541
ALL INBOUND U.S. CONTAINERS, YET

03:51:28.608 --> 03:51:30.509
WE LACK THE NECESSARY

03:51:30.576 --> 03:51:32.345
INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT CLEAN

03:51:32.411 --> 03:51:34.380
ALTERNATIVE FUELS IN THIS HEAVY

03:51:34.447 --> 03:51:36.215
INDUSTRIAL SECTOR. GLOBAL

03:51:36.282 --> 03:51:37.617
COMPETITORS ARE ADVANCING

03:51:37.683 --> 03:51:39.051
MULTIFUEL OPERATIONS, AND

03:51:39.118 --> 03:51:40.653
CALIFORNIA RISKS FALLING BEHIND

03:51:40.720 --> 03:51:42.722
IN THE TRANSITION TO CLEANER

03:51:42.788 --> 03:51:44.957
MARITIME INDUSTRY. BARRIERS SUCH

03:51:45.024 --> 03:51:47.093
AS INADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE,

03:51:47.159 --> 03:51:49.128
LENGTHY PERMITTING PROCESSES,

REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY CONTINUE

03:51:52.665 --> 03:51:54.533

HINDER INVESTMENTS IN CLEANER

03:51:56.435 --> 03:51:58.237
FUEL TECHNOLOGIES. THIS BILL

03:51:58.304 --> 03:52:00.306
WILL CREATE A COLLABORATIVE PLAN

03:52:00.373 --> 03:52:02.541

AND FUELING OF ALTERNATIVE FUELS

03:52:05.945 --> 03:52:07.880
AT CALIFORNIA'S SEAPORT. THE

03:52:07.947 --> 03:52:10.349
PLAN WILL BE FUEL AGNOSTIC,

03:52:10.416 --> 03:52:11.851
MEANING IT WILL REMAIN INCLUSIVE

03:52:11.917 --> 03:52:14.053

03:52:15.221 --> 03:52:16.589
CALIFORNIA PORTS REMAIN AT THE

03:52:16.656 --> 03:52:18.024
FOREFRONT OF CLEAN ENERGY

03:52:18.090 --> 03:52:19.091

REDUCING DIESEL ADMISSION AT OUR

03:52:24.430 --> 03:52:26.232
PORTS WILL LEAD TO CLEANER AIR

03:52:26.299 --> 03:52:27.967
FOR MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS,

03:52:28.034 --> 03:52:29.802

THEY CAN BE REFUELED. AS YOU ARE

03:54:14.740 --> 03:54:16.475
ALL AWARE, CALIFORNIA'S GOODS

03:54:16.542 --> 03:54:17.710

03:54:30.423 --> 03:54:31.991
CANNOT REALISTICALLY ACHIEVE

03:54:32.057 --> 03:54:32.858
CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE GOALS WITH

A HAPHAZARD APPROACH TO ACCESS

03:54:34.927 --> 03:54:36.962
AND SUPPORT FOR CLEANER FUELS.

03:54:37.029 --> 03:54:38.964
SB 298 IS A CRITICAL INGREDIENT

03:54:39.031 --> 03:54:41.033
IN THE RECIPE FOR CALIFORNIA TO

03:54:41.100 --> 03:54:42.334

03:54:45.604 --> 03:54:47.106
FOR THE AVAILABILITY OF

03:54:47.173 --> 03:54:48.441

WORST BY CLIMATE CHANGE AND

04:03:18.183 --> 04:03:19.551

AFFORDABILITY CRISIS IN

04:04:30.055 --> 04:04:31.923
CALIFORNIA. UNFORTUNATELY, WE

04:04:31.990 --> 04:04:33.959
ARE NOT MEETING THE CHALLENGE OF

04:04:34.026 --> 04:04:36.261
ALL THREE CLEAN AIR AND WATER

04:04:36.328 --> 04:04:38.130

04:04:39.598 --> 04:04:41.333
A PIPE DREAM FOR MANY OF THE

04:04:41.400 --> 04:04:42.367

04:04:42.434 --> 04:04:44.302
COUNCIL. WORKS WITH, AND

04:04:44.369 --> 04:04:46.171
POLLUTING FACILITIES CONTINUE TO

04:04:46.238 --> 04:04:47.039
BE DISPROPORTIONATELY SITED IN

04:04:47.105 --> 04:04:50.675
THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS, WHICH ONLY

04:04:50.742 --> 04:04:51.877
PROLIFERATE WITH THE RECENT

04:04:51.943 --> 04:04:54.312
DISMANTLING OF CEQA THROUGH AB

04:04:54.379 --> 04:04:56.148
131 AND EXTREME HEAT THAT

04:04:56.214 --> 04:04:57.015
THREATENS THE LIVES OF OUR

04:04:57.082 --> 04:05:00.018
COMMUNITIES SUMMER AFTER SUMMER,

04:05:00.085 --> 04:05:01.887
THIS PROGRAM MUST BE, WE ARE

04:05:01.953 --> 04:05:02.921
ASKING THAT THIS PROGRAM BE

04:05:02.988 --> 04:05:04.689
TIGHTENED TO REDUCE POLLUTION,

04:05:04.756 --> 04:05:06.458
ADDRESS THE CLIMATE CRISIS

04:05:06.525 --> 04:05:07.692
MEANINGFULLY AND JUST NOT ON

04:05:07.759 --> 04:05:08.794
PAPER, AND IMPROVE COST

04:05:08.860 --> 04:05:10.395
PROTECTIONS FOR LOW INCOME

04:05:10.462 --> 04:05:11.630
CALIFORNIANS. THE LAO HAS STATED

04:05:11.696 --> 04:05:13.799
THAT THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE

04:05:13.865 --> 04:05:14.733
PROGRAM IS NOT STRINGENT ENOUGH

04:05:14.800 --> 04:05:16.334
TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS. THIS

04:05:16.401 --> 04:05:19.504
IS IN LARGE PART DUE TO THE

04:05:19.571 --> 04:05:20.572
SUBSTANTIAL SUBSIDIES THAT COME

04:05:20.639 --> 04:05:22.307
THROUGH FREE ALLOWANCES AND

04:05:22.374 --> 04:05:24.042

INDUSTRIAL FACILITY WOULD FREE

04:05:27.179 --> 04:05:29.247
UP BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR GRF

04:05:29.314 --> 04:05:30.482
THAT CAN BE INVESTED IN LOW

04:05:30.549 --> 04:05:32.184
INCOME COMMUNITIES TO PREPARE

04:05:32.250 --> 04:05:34.052
FOR THE CLIMATE CRISIS, QUITE

04:05:34.119 --> 04:05:36.721
LITERALLY, SAVING LIVES THROUGH

04:05:36.788 --> 04:05:38.690
PROGRAMS LIKE THE SAFER WATER

04:05:38.757 --> 04:05:41.626
PROGRAM, EPD, TCC, AND CRC

04:05:41.693 --> 04:05:42.661
PROGRAMS. RIGHT NOW, WE ARE

04:05:42.727 --> 04:05:44.362
SEEING THE IMPACTS OF UNMANAGED

04:05:44.429 --> 04:05:46.898
CLIMATE, OF UNMANAGED CLIMATE

04:05:46.965 --> 04:05:47.532
TRANSITION THAT ALLOWS THE OIL

04:05:47.599 --> 04:05:49.835
AND GAS INDUSTRY TO LARGELY BUY

04:05:49.901 --> 04:05:51.803
THEIR WAY OUT OF EMISSION

04:05:51.870 --> 04:05:53.338
REDUCTION, AND LACKS PROACTIVE

04:05:53.405 --> 04:05:54.473
REGULATIONS THAT ENSURES THE

04:05:54.539 --> 04:05:56.575
CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION IS

04:05:56.641 --> 04:05:57.676
AFFORDABLE, AFFORDABLE,

04:05:57.742 --> 04:05:59.411
PARTICULARLY FOR LOW IN

04:05:59.478 --> 04:06:03.348
CALIFORNIA'S. WE ASK THAT SB 840

04:06:03.415 --> 04:06:05.951
BE AMENDED TO HELP CALIFORNIA

04:06:06.017 --> 04:06:07.619
DETERMINE WHETHER IT WILL LEAD

04:06:07.686 --> 04:06:09.554
ON GLOBAL EFFORTS TO AVOID THE

04:06:09.621 --> 04:06:10.989
CATASTROPHIC IMPACTS OF CLIMATE

04:06:11.056 --> 04:06:13.258
CHANGE, OR IF WE CONTINUE ON A

04:06:13.325 --> 04:06:15.660
PATH OF LAX CLIMATE REGULATIONS.

04:06:15.727 --> 04:06:17.629
WE URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO

04:06:17.696 --> 04:06:20.332
SIGNIFICANTLY AMEND SB 840.

04:06:20.398 --> 04:06:22.234
THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

04:06:22.300 --> 04:06:24.302
ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION TO SB

04:06:24.369 --> 04:06:26.605
840? SEEING NONE. BRING IT BACK

04:06:26.671 --> 04:06:28.440
TO THE COMMITTEE. ANY QUESTIONS

04:06:28.507 --> 04:06:29.441
FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON SB

04:06:29.508 --> 04:06:35.147
840? SEEING MR. ALICE, YOU GUYS

04:06:35.213 --> 04:06:39.050
SORRY. PLEASE HOLD. CAN YOU

04:06:39.117 --> 04:06:40.852
EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT YOU MEAN BY

04:06:40.919 --> 04:06:45.624
BUY THEIR WAY OUT IN WITH IN THE

04:06:45.690 --> 04:06:48.093
CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM, YOU CAN

04:06:48.160 --> 04:06:49.227
COMPLY THREE WAYS. YOU CAN

04:06:49.294 --> 04:06:51.062
REDUCE YOUR EMISSIONS. YOU CAN

04:06:51.129 --> 04:06:54.599
BUY OFFSETS OR YOU CAN BUY

04:06:54.666 --> 04:06:57.169
ALLOWANCES. AND SO CURRENTLY,

04:06:57.235 --> 04:06:58.803
BECAUSE THERE ARE NO FACILITY

04:06:58.870 --> 04:07:02.107
LEVEL FACILITY SPECIFIC CAPS, AN

04:07:02.174 --> 04:07:03.575
ENTITY COULD COMPLETELY COMPLY

04:07:03.642 --> 04:07:04.976
WITH CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM

04:07:05.043 --> 04:07:07.913
WITHOUT MAKING A SINGLE SINGLE

04:07:07.979 --> 04:07:09.514
REDUCTION IN CARBON EMISSIONS.

04:07:09.581 --> 04:07:11.816
SO WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IF YOU

04:07:11.883 --> 04:07:12.984
WANTED TO START A MANUFACTURING

04:07:13.051 --> 04:07:15.020
PLANT AND YOU NEEDED NATURAL GAS

04:07:15.086 --> 04:07:18.823
AS YOUR SOURCE OF ENERGY, IS

04:07:18.890 --> 04:07:20.058
THAT PERSON THAT'S NOT RELATED

04:07:20.125 --> 04:07:21.560
TO THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY

04:07:21.626 --> 04:07:22.961
BUYING THEIR WAY OUT WHEN THEY

04:07:23.028 --> 04:07:24.896
BUY CREDITS? IF SO, IT'S NOT THE

04:07:24.963 --> 04:07:26.965
OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY, IT'S ANY

04:07:27.032 --> 04:07:29.901
INDUSTRY. IS THAT CORRECT? I THE

04:07:29.968 --> 04:07:33.371
ISSUE WITH THE ISSUE WITH NOT

04:07:33.438 --> 04:07:35.273
NOT HAVING FACILITY CAPS IS NOT

04:07:35.340 --> 04:07:37.209
LIMITED TO JUST THE OIL AND GAS

04:07:37.275 --> 04:07:38.410
INDUSTRY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU

04:07:38.476 --> 04:07:40.412
VERY MUCH. WHY DO YOU SAY OIL

04:07:40.478 --> 04:07:42.881
AND GAS IS DIRTY AND THE CAUSE

04:07:42.948 --> 04:07:45.250
OF POLLUTION? YEAH, I MEAN, WE

04:07:45.317 --> 04:07:46.785
WORK WITH COMMUNITIES THAT LIVE

04:07:46.851 --> 04:07:48.553
ON THE FRONT LINE OF, OF THESE

04:07:48.620 --> 04:07:49.354
REFINERIES AND DEAL WITH THE

04:07:49.421 --> 04:07:51.690
HEALTH IMPACTS EVERY DAY, YOU

ATTACKS, NOSE BLEEDS. LIKE WE

04:07:54.859 --> 04:07:57.162
KNOW THAT THIS IS A DIFFICULT

04:07:57.229 --> 04:07:59.164
COMMUNITY TO HAVE IN YOUR

04:07:59.231 --> 04:07:59.764
NEIGHBORHOOD. ARE YOU FAMILIAR

04:07:59.831 --> 04:08:01.299
WITH THE AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT

04:08:01.366 --> 04:08:03.001
DISTRICT? OKAY. ARE YOU FAMILIAR

04:08:03.068 --> 04:08:04.336
WITH THE REGULATIONS THAT THEY

04:08:04.402 --> 04:08:05.904
PUT ON THE REFINING AND THE OIL

04:08:05.971 --> 04:08:07.772
AND GAS SECTOR? SOMEWHAT.

04:08:07.839 --> 04:08:08.740
PROBABLY NOT THE MOST EXPERT

04:08:08.807 --> 04:08:10.542
PERSON HERE, BUT I'VE BEEN IN

04:08:10.609 --> 04:08:11.710
THE INDUSTRY FOR 40 YEARS. I

04:08:11.776 --> 04:08:12.744
UNDERSTAND IT. YOU'RE WRONG

04:08:12.811 --> 04:08:14.546
ABOUT OIL BEING OIL BEING DIRTY.

04:08:14.613 --> 04:08:16.381

RATES. WE HAVE WE HAVE HIGHER

04:08:49.414 --> 04:08:52.150
AIR POLLUTION IN OUR FRONTLINE

04:08:52.217 --> 04:08:54.386
COMMUNITIES THAT SURROUND THE

04:08:54.452 --> 04:08:57.656
REFINERIES. AT THE SAME TIME,

04:08:57.722 --> 04:09:01.993

OUR REFINERIES OPEN. YOU KNOW,

04:09:12.404 --> 04:09:15.774
GIVEN THAT, THAT IT'S GOING TO

04:09:15.840 --> 04:09:19.711
HAVE THE PROJECTION IS THAT IF

04:09:19.778 --> 04:09:21.546
MORE REFINERIES CLOSED THAT THAT

04:09:21.613 --> 04:09:25.350
IT'S GOING TO HAVE A HUGE IMPACT

04:09:25.417 --> 04:09:28.987
ON ON GAS PRICES AND IT'S GOING

04:09:29.054 --> 04:09:34.326
TO UNDERMINE ANY ATTEMPT FOR A

04:09:34.392 --> 04:09:36.594
TRANSITION THAT IS NOT GOING TO

04:09:36.661 --> 04:09:38.663
TRIGGER A POLITICAL BACKLASH

04:09:38.730 --> 04:09:41.666
AGAINST OUR EFFORTS TO, TO

04:09:41.733 --> 04:09:42.934
ADVANCE OUR CLIMATE GOALS. AND

IMPORT REFINED GAS TO MEET THE

04:10:03.154 --> 04:10:07.425
ONGOING DEMAND FOR GAS IN

04:10:07.492 --> 04:10:12.130
CALIFORNIA. YEAH. I JUST WANTED,

04:10:12.197 --> 04:10:14.599
GIVEN THAT I THOUGHT WE WERE

04:10:14.666 --> 04:10:16.368
JUST GOING TO BE VOTING ON LLIO

04:10:16.434 --> 04:10:19.070

04:10:19.137 --> 04:10:20.772
THAT THIS MAY BE ONE OF THE FEW

04:10:20.839 --> 04:10:22.407
OPPORTUNITIES WHERE WE ACTUALLY

04:10:22.474 --> 04:10:25.510
GET TO QUESTION WITNESSES ON CAP

04:10:25.577 --> 04:10:29.013
AND TRADE, WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE

04:10:29.080 --> 04:10:30.949
TO, YOU KNOW, THE VERY LIKELY

04:10:31.015 --> 04:10:31.850
SCENARIO THAT WE'RE GOING TO

04:10:31.916 --> 04:10:33.852
HAVE TO JUST CONTINUE TO IMPORT

04:10:33.918 --> 04:10:37.055
REFINED GAS? VERY MUCH

04:10:37.122 --> 04:10:38.456
APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTION AND

04:10:38.523 --> 04:10:40.291
APPRECIATE THAT CALIFORNIA

04:10:40.358 --> 04:10:42.360
ABSOLUTELY NEEDS AN EXPLICIT

04:10:42.427 --> 04:10:44.929
PLAN FOR TRANSITIONING AWAY FROM

04:10:44.996 --> 04:10:47.132
FOSSIL FUELS. I THINK IT'S FAIR

04:10:47.198 --> 04:10:48.500
TO SAY THAT THIS TRANSITION

04:10:48.566 --> 04:10:49.701
PROBABLY HAS COME A LITTLE BIT

04:10:49.768 --> 04:10:52.170
FASTER THAN SOME THAN SOME HAVE

04:10:52.237 --> 04:10:53.538
EXPECTED, BUT GLOBAL GAS DEMAND

04:10:53.605 --> 04:10:56.641
HAS PEAKED AT, HAS PEAKED, AND

04:10:56.708 --> 04:10:58.610
THAT THERE ARE GLOBAL ISSUES,

04:10:58.676 --> 04:11:01.579
THERE ARE GLOBAL FACTORS THAT

04:11:01.646 --> 04:11:03.348
ARE THAT ARE ACTUALLY CLOSING

04:11:03.415 --> 04:11:04.349
REFINERIES, NOT JUST IN

04:11:04.416 --> 04:11:05.784
CALIFORNIA, BUT CLOSING A

04:11:05.850 --> 04:11:08.019
REFINERY. REFINERY IN TEXAS,

04:11:08.086 --> 04:11:09.821
CLOSING A REFINERY IN

04:11:09.888 --> 04:11:11.923
PENNSYLVANIA. DESPITE THEIR

04:11:11.990 --> 04:11:13.725
CLAIMS, ENVIRONMENTAL

04:11:13.792 --> 04:11:15.660
REGULATIONS ARE A SMALL PORTION

04:11:15.727 --> 04:11:17.362
OF THE CONVERSATION THAT IS

04:11:17.429 --> 04:11:18.930
HAPPENING ABOUT REFINERY

04:11:18.997 --> 04:11:22.400
CLOSURES AND SO ON. SO WHILE WE

04:11:22.467 --> 04:11:24.669
ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT WE NEED TO

04:11:24.736 --> 04:11:27.739
HAVE A PLANNED, YOU KNOW, A

04:11:27.806 --> 04:11:29.941
PLANNED TRANSITION AWAY FROM

04:11:30.008 --> 04:11:31.376
REFINERIES, WALKING AWAY FROM

04:11:31.443 --> 04:11:32.811
OUR ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS,

04:11:32.877 --> 04:11:34.312
WHETHER IT BE CLIMATE

04:11:34.379 --> 04:11:36.448
REGULATIONS OR AIR POLLUTION, IS

04:11:36.514 --> 04:11:38.516
NOT ACTUALLY GOING TO MAKE THE

04:11:38.583 --> 04:11:41.886
REFINERY STAY, STAY IN BUSINESS.

04:11:41.953 --> 04:11:43.755
NOR WILL SUBSIDIES, INCLUDING

04:11:43.822 --> 04:11:45.457
FREE ALLOWANCES GIVEN TO THE OIL

04:11:45.523 --> 04:11:47.625
AND GAS, OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY,

04:11:47.692 --> 04:11:49.794
ACTUALLY RESULT IN SAVINGS TO

04:11:49.861 --> 04:11:50.929
CONSUMERS. THE WHOLE PHILOSOPHY

04:11:50.995 --> 04:11:52.263
OF GIVING FREE ALLOWANCES IN THE

04:11:52.330 --> 04:11:54.466
FIRST PLACE IS THAT THE THAT THE

04:11:54.532 --> 04:11:56.534
COST OF COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE

04:11:56.601 --> 04:11:57.769
SAVINGS WOULD BE PASSED ON TO

04:11:57.836 --> 04:12:00.572
THE CONSUMERS. I THINK YOU CAN

04:12:00.638 --> 04:12:04.142
LOOK AT THE VAST, THE VAST

04:12:04.209 --> 04:12:05.577
PROFITS OF THE OIL AND GAS

04:12:05.643 --> 04:12:07.745
INDUSTRY, AND IT IS HARD TO SAY.

04:12:07.812 --> 04:12:09.681
IT IS HARD TO SAY THAT ACTUALLY

04:12:09.747 --> 04:12:11.249
US GIVING THEM FREE ALLOWANCES

04:12:11.316 --> 04:12:12.851
HAVE RESULTED IN ANY SAVINGS TO

04:12:12.917 --> 04:12:14.619
THE CONSUMERS. WE REALLY

04:12:14.686 --> 04:12:15.987
APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE'S

04:12:16.054 --> 04:12:18.556
WORK ON LOOKING AT PRICE

04:12:18.623 --> 04:12:21.092
GOUGING. THAT WAS A GREAT THAT

04:12:21.159 --> 04:12:24.295
WAS A GREAT PIECE OF THE

04:12:24.362 --> 04:12:26.331
CONVERSATION ABOUT PART OF THE

04:12:26.397 --> 04:12:27.465
TRANSITION. WE HAVEN'T FINISHED

04:12:27.532 --> 04:12:30.034
THAT PROCESS. YOU ALL PASS LAWS

04:12:30.101 --> 04:12:31.903
TO ACTUALLY REQUIRE THE CEC TO

04:12:31.970 --> 04:12:33.671
LOOK AT PRICE GOUGING, BUT THEY

04:12:33.738 --> 04:12:35.039
HAVEN'T FINISHED THOSE

04:12:35.106 --> 04:12:36.774
REGULATIONS. SO GETTING DOING,

04:12:36.841 --> 04:12:39.177
TAKING ACTIONS LIKE FINISHING

04:12:39.244 --> 04:12:41.312
THE REGULATIONS ON PRICE GOUGING

04:12:41.379 --> 04:12:43.314
ARE REALLY ESSENTIAL POINT

04:12:43.381 --> 04:12:47.352
ESSENTIAL PART OF PROTECTING

04:12:47.418 --> 04:12:49.087
CONSUMERS WHILE STILL GETTING TO

04:12:49.153 --> 04:12:50.922
OUR CLIMATE AND AIR POLLUTION

04:12:50.989 --> 04:12:53.825
GOALS. BUT IT SEEMS LIKE I MEAN,

04:12:53.892 --> 04:13:02.534
THE ENERGY COMMISSIONER. HAS

04:13:02.600 --> 04:13:04.402
SPOKEN ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNOR

04:13:04.469 --> 04:13:06.437
THAT, YOU KNOW, AT THE VERY

04:13:06.504 --> 04:13:08.873
LEAST, YOU KNOW, INDICATIONS OF

04:13:08.940 --> 04:13:13.211
A. PRICE GOUGING PENALTY HAS

04:13:13.278 --> 04:13:15.747
BEEN ABANDONED. I BELIEVE THEY

04:13:15.813 --> 04:13:17.982
WERE ASKED TO PAUSE WHILE THEY

04:13:18.049 --> 04:13:19.484
LOOKED AT OTHER ISSUES. THANK. I

04:13:19.551 --> 04:13:23.254
APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION.

04:13:23.321 --> 04:13:24.923
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

04:13:24.989 --> 04:13:28.459
MR. SO FIRST I WANT TO THANK

04:13:28.526 --> 04:13:30.795
BOTH OF THE WITNESSES HERE. AND

04:13:30.862 --> 04:13:31.696
IN ADDITION TO YOUR EXPERIENCE,

04:13:31.763 --> 04:13:33.598
WHICH I RESPECT, I'VE KNOWN BOTH

04:13:33.665 --> 04:13:35.800
OF THE BOTH OF THE FOLKS HERE

04:13:35.867 --> 04:13:36.901
WHO ARE THE OPPOSITION WITNESSES

04:13:36.968 --> 04:13:39.103
WHO SPENT MANY YEARS PROTECTING

04:13:39.170 --> 04:13:40.905
FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES. AND IT'S

04:13:40.972 --> 04:13:42.173
CLEARLY AN IMPORTANT VOICE IN

04:13:42.240 --> 04:13:45.443
ALL OF THIS. AND I JUST WANT TO

04:13:45.510 --> 04:13:48.012
RECOGNIZE THAT THE COMMENTS I'M

04:13:48.079 --> 04:13:49.881
SORRY. I JUST WANT TO RECOGNIZE

04:13:49.948 --> 04:13:52.216
THAT THERE WAS A THERE WERE

04:13:52.283 --> 04:13:53.551
SEVERAL LETTERS THAT ACTUALLY

04:13:53.618 --> 04:13:56.020
OUTLINED SOME OF THE VIEWS OF

04:13:56.087 --> 04:13:57.422
THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

04:13:57.488 --> 04:13:58.590
COMMUNITIES ABOUT WHAT SHOULD BE

04:13:58.656 --> 04:14:00.458
PART OF CAP AND TRADE. AND I

04:14:00.525 --> 04:14:02.226
KNOW THAT THE CHAIR WILL BE

04:14:02.293 --> 04:14:03.561
PASSING THOSE LETTERS ALONG TO

04:14:03.628 --> 04:14:05.063
THAT WORKING GROUP, AND I'M NOT

04:14:05.129 --> 04:14:06.864
QUITE SURE WHAT THE PROCESS IS,

04:14:06.931 --> 04:14:09.801
BUT THERE WILL BE OPPORTUNITIES

04:14:09.867 --> 04:14:11.035
TO WEIGH IN ON THE SHAPING OF

04:14:11.102 --> 04:14:13.204
THAT PROGRAM GIVEN, YOU KNOW, I

04:14:13.271 --> 04:14:15.106
THINK ALL OF US WHO HAVE HAD

04:14:15.173 --> 04:14:16.941
BILLS THAT ARE SORT OF THAT

04:14:17.008 --> 04:14:19.043
TREAD INTO THE CAP AND TRADE

04:14:19.110 --> 04:14:22.013
AREA, WE'VE TRIED TO AVOID

04:14:22.080 --> 04:14:23.514
STEPPING INTO AREAS THAT

04:14:23.581 --> 04:14:26.551
ACTUALLY PRE JUDGE WHERE THOSE

04:14:26.618 --> 04:14:28.519
CAP AND TRADE PROPOSALS MIGHT

04:14:28.586 --> 04:14:29.721
COME OUT. AND I SUSPECT THAT

04:14:29.787 --> 04:14:31.289
SENATOR LIMÓN HAS DONE THE SAME

04:14:31.356 --> 04:14:33.625
THING. I THINK THIS IS A FAIRLY

04:14:33.691 --> 04:14:34.559
NARROW BILL THAT REALLY JUST

04:14:34.626 --> 04:14:36.194
LOOKS AT THE REPORTING. AND

04:14:36.260 --> 04:14:37.295
BASED ON THAT I'LL BE SUPPORTING

04:14:37.362 --> 04:14:38.630
IT TODAY. AND I WANT TO THANK

04:14:38.696 --> 04:14:41.099
YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE. THANK

04:14:41.165 --> 04:14:43.468
YOU VERY MUCH. ANYBODY ELSE?

04:14:43.534 --> 04:14:45.236
THANK YOU. NOT THE CONVERSATION

04:14:45.303 --> 04:14:48.339
I WAS EXPECTING, BUT I THINK

04:14:48.406 --> 04:14:50.541
IT'S MURATSUCHI MYSELF ARE THE

04:14:50.608 --> 04:14:51.542
ONLY TWO ON THE DAIS THAT WERE

04:14:51.609 --> 04:14:53.611
HERE WHEN THAT REAUTHORIZATION

04:14:53.678 --> 04:14:54.479
FOR CAP AND TRADE. I WAS HAPPY

04:14:54.545 --> 04:14:56.447
TO SUPPORT IT THEN. THIS IS

04:14:56.514 --> 04:14:57.482
OBVIOUSLY A HUGE CONVERSATION

04:14:57.548 --> 04:14:58.950
THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN OUT NEXT

04:14:59.017 --> 04:15:00.585
MONTH. AND THERE'S A LOT OF BOTH

04:15:00.652 --> 04:15:02.387
SIDES THAT NEEDS TO GET WORKED

04:15:02.453 --> 04:15:04.255
OUT. SO, MR. CHAIR, WOULD YOU

04:15:04.322 --> 04:15:05.256
LIKE TO CLOSE? NO THANK YOU. I

04:15:05.323 --> 04:15:07.325
CERTAINLY WHEN I AGREED TO TAKE

04:15:07.392 --> 04:15:08.526
ON THIS BILL FOR SENATOR LIMÓN,

04:15:08.593 --> 04:15:10.895
I HAD NO IDEA THAT A LAO REPORT

04:15:10.962 --> 04:15:12.363
ON THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS AND

04:15:12.430 --> 04:15:13.731
BENEFITS OF CAP AND TRADE

04:15:13.798 --> 04:15:14.899
PROGRAM WOULD DEMONSTRATE OR

04:15:14.966 --> 04:15:16.734
WOULD, WOULD DRAW OUT SO MUCH

04:15:16.801 --> 04:15:17.602
THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATION, BUT I'M

04:15:17.669 --> 04:15:19.003
ACTUALLY REALLY GLAD THAT IT

04:15:19.070 --> 04:15:20.238
DID. AND I THINK ENVIRONMENTAL

04:15:20.304 --> 04:15:21.272
COMMUNITIES, ENVIRONMENTAL

04:15:21.339 --> 04:15:21.873
JUSTICE, COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

04:15:21.939 --> 04:15:23.074
HERE, FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES THAT

04:15:23.141 --> 04:15:24.842
ARE HERE, THAT ARE TAKING EVERY

04:15:24.909 --> 04:15:26.711
SINGLE OPPORTUNITY THEY CAN TO

04:15:26.778 --> 04:15:28.479
WEIGH INTO THIS PROCESS, THAT IS

04:15:28.546 --> 04:15:29.881
EXACTLY WHAT YOU SHOULD BE

04:15:29.947 --> 04:15:34.585
DOING. WITH RESPECT TO THIS

04:15:34.652 --> 04:15:36.421
BILL. THE SENATOR JUST ASKED FOR

04:15:36.487 --> 04:15:37.722
YOUR AYE VOTE WITH RESPECT TO

04:15:37.789 --> 04:15:39.257
THAT PROCESS. I CAN ASSURE YOU

04:15:39.323 --> 04:15:41.459
THERE IS AT LEAST ONE AND MORE

04:15:41.526 --> 04:15:43.961
WHO BELIEVE THAT A

04:15:44.028 --> 04:15:45.029
REAUTHORIZATION THAT

04:15:45.096 --> 04:15:46.164
AUTOMATICALLY INCLUDES

04:15:46.230 --> 04:15:47.999
ALLOWANCES AND OFFSETS FOR THE

04:15:48.066 --> 04:15:50.768
OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY IS NOT AN

04:15:50.835 --> 04:15:52.403
IDEAL STARTING SPOT. IT WASN'T

04:15:52.470 --> 04:15:54.005
THE STARTING SPOT LAST TIME THIS

04:15:54.072 --> 04:15:56.240
HAPPENED. I ALSO, WITH RESPECT

04:15:56.307 --> 04:15:57.608
TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM KERN

04:15:57.675 --> 04:15:58.576
COUNTY, I THINK ASKING IF OIL

04:15:58.643 --> 04:16:00.778
AND GAS IS DIRTY IS LIKE ASKING

04:16:00.845 --> 04:16:05.316
IF WATER IS WET, AND I WILL END

04:16:05.383 --> 04:16:08.152
WITH THAT AND RESPECTFULLY ASK

04:16:08.219 --> 04:16:13.224
