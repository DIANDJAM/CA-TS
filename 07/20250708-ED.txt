00:38:39.817 --> 00:38:43.020
ACROSS NUMEROUS INDUSTRIES,

00:38:43.087 --> 00:38:43.988
HOWEVER, OUR CURRENT PROCUREMENT

00:38:44.055 --> 00:38:49.093
SYSTEM. TITLE ENTERPRISES CAN

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:51.162
CONTINUE PARTNERING EFFECTIVELY

00:38:51.228 --> 00:38:52.663
WITH THE STATE. THAT'S WHAT I

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:55.900
WAS WAITING FOR, I COULDN'T SB

00:38:55.966 --> 00:38:58.069
70 WILL INCREASE THE MAXIMUM

00:38:58.135 --> 00:39:00.171
CONTRACT VALUE UNDER THE SMALL

00:39:00.237 --> 00:39:01.939
BUSINESS PROCUREMENT AND

00:39:02.006 --> 00:39:07.211
CONTRACT ACT FROM $250,000 TO

00:39:07.278 --> 00:39:08.479
$350,000. THIS BILL ALSO TIES

00:39:08.546 --> 00:39:10.481
FUTURE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE

00:39:10.548 --> 00:39:12.049
CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRICE INDEX

00:39:12.116 --> 00:39:13.951
TO ENSURE THE CAP STAYS CURRENT

00:39:14.018 --> 00:39:16.087
WITH ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THE

00:39:16.153 --> 00:39:18.556
CURRENT $250,000 CAP HAS

00:39:18.622 --> 00:39:22.093
REMAINED UNCHANGED SINCE 2009,

00:39:22.159 --> 00:39:23.894
DESPITE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC

00:39:23.961 --> 00:39:26.230
CHANGES WHEN ACCOUNTING FOR

00:39:26.297 --> 00:39:29.400
INFLATION. THE 250,000 CAP FROM

00:39:29.467 --> 00:39:31.335
2009 WOULD EQUATE TO

00:39:31.402 --> 00:39:34.405
APPROXIMATELY 370,000 IN TODAY'S

00:39:34.472 --> 00:39:36.307
DOLLARS. AS A RESULT, QUALIFIED

00:39:36.373 --> 00:39:38.042
SMALL BUSINESSES ARE BEING

00:39:38.109 --> 00:39:39.510
EXCLUDED FROM CONTRACTS THAT

00:39:39.577 --> 00:39:40.878
THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN ELIGIBLE

00:39:40.945 --> 00:39:42.747
FOR WHEN THE CAP WAS ORIGINALLY

00:39:42.813 --> 00:39:44.749
SET. SB 70 WILL UPDATE THE

00:39:44.815 --> 00:39:46.317
CURRENT CAP TO REFLECT TODAY'S

00:39:46.383 --> 00:39:47.718
ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND HELP

00:39:47.785 --> 00:39:49.787
CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES STAY

00:39:49.854 --> 00:39:51.355
COMPETITIVE. SO WHEN THE TIME

00:39:51.422 --> 00:39:52.823
COMES, I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:55.192
FOR YOUR VOTE AND I DO NOT HAVE

00:39:55.259 --> 00:39:56.260
A WITNESS. TODAY IS MY CUSTOM

00:39:56.327 --> 00:39:58.963
UNLESS I FEEL LIKE WE REALLY,

00:39:59.029 --> 00:40:00.097
REALLY NEED ONE AND WANT TO TAKE

00:40:00.164 --> 00:40:02.867
THOSE TWO MINUTES UP, THEN I

00:40:02.933 --> 00:40:18.983
WILL NOT BRING ONE.

00:40:19.049 --> 00:40:20.351
GOT IT? THANK YOU SENATOR. WE'LL

00:40:20.417 --> 00:40:22.019

00:40:22.086 --> 00:40:24.622
THERE'S NO PRIMARY WITNESSES.

00:40:24.688 --> 00:40:26.323
ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:27.825
SUPPORT IN THE ROOM? GOOD

00:40:27.892 --> 00:40:28.592

BUSINESSES WITH ME TODAY. AND I

00:41:01.458 --> 00:41:03.260
THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT IS

00:41:03.327 --> 00:41:06.096
SOMEBODY WHO'S IN THE TRENCHES.

00:41:06.163 --> 00:41:07.631
UNFORTUNATELY, THE COMMITTEE

00:41:07.698 --> 00:41:08.999
ANALYSIS COMPLETELY MISSED ALL

00:41:09.066 --> 00:41:11.168
OF OUR CONCERNS, AND I'M DEEPLY

00:41:11.235 --> 00:41:12.536
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. BUT I

00:41:12.603 --> 00:41:14.371
BROUGHT WITH ME TODAY MR.

00:41:14.438 --> 00:41:15.706
STEPHEN SIMPSON, WHO IS

00:41:15.773 --> 00:41:19.410
PRESIDENT AND CEO OF SAN JOAQUIN

00:41:19.476 --> 00:41:20.678
DISTRIBUTORS, WHO'S BEEN WORKING

00:41:20.744 --> 00:41:22.246
WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS

00:41:22.313 --> 00:41:24.081
A SMALL BUSINESS FOR THE LAST 40

00:41:24.148 --> 00:41:25.583
YEARS. WITH THAT, I'D LIKE TO

00:41:25.649 --> 00:41:28.018
INTRODUCE STEVE SIMPSON TO GIVE

00:41:28.085 --> 00:41:29.753
SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THIS. BILL.

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:32.289
AND I WILL GO ON FROM THERE. I

00:41:32.356 --> 00:41:35.759
THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO

00:41:35.826 --> 00:41:42.032
SPEAK. I APPRECIATE THE

00:41:42.099 --> 00:41:43.300
SENATOR'S EFFORTS IN WANTING TO

00:41:43.367 --> 00:41:45.269
HELP ENCOURAGE SMALL BUSINESSES

00:41:45.336 --> 00:41:46.570
AND DOING BUSINESS WITH THE

00:41:46.637 --> 00:41:49.807
STATE OF CALIFORNIA, BUT I WILL

00:41:49.874 --> 00:41:52.376
TELL YOU THAT THIS WILL NOT

00:41:52.443 --> 00:41:54.712
ENHANCE SMALL BUSINESS

00:41:54.778 --> 00:41:55.980
PARTICIPATION IN CONTRACTING

00:41:56.046 --> 00:41:57.815
WITH THE STATE. I CONTRACT WITH

00:41:57.882 --> 00:41:59.750
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I

00:41:59.817 --> 00:42:01.518
PARTNER WITH SUBCONTRACTORS TO

00:42:01.585 --> 00:42:04.722
WORK WITH ME ON THOSE CONTRACTS.

00:42:04.788 --> 00:42:08.392
AND THIS TYPE OF PURCHASING

00:42:08.459 --> 00:42:11.862
ORIGINALLY WAS FOR EMERGENCY

00:42:11.929 --> 00:42:14.365
PURCHASES ONLY. IT ONLY

00:42:14.431 --> 00:42:16.233
INCREASED BECAUSE OF

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:17.568
OVERCROWDING WITH CORRECTIONS

00:42:17.635 --> 00:42:21.138
AND AN INCREASE TWICE ONCE FROM

00:42:21.205 --> 00:42:22.506
50,000 TO 100,000, THEN FROM

00:42:22.573 --> 00:42:25.542
100,000 250,000. IT DID NOTHING

00:42:25.609 --> 00:42:27.478
TO INCREASE THE SMALL BUSINESS

00:42:27.544 --> 00:42:28.879
PARTICIPATION WITH THE STATE OF

00:42:28.946 --> 00:42:30.281
CALIFORNIA. IT WAS SIMPLY FOR

00:42:30.347 --> 00:42:31.849
EMERGENCY PURPOSES ONLY BECAUSE

00:42:31.916 --> 00:42:33.684
OF OVERCROWDING, WHICH WE DO NOT

00:42:33.751 --> 00:42:36.153
HAVE NOW. WE ARE 50% LESS THAN

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:40.224
IT WAS AT ITS PEAK, AND THIS

00:42:40.291 --> 00:42:41.325
TYPE OF PURCHASING WITH THE

00:42:41.392 --> 00:42:46.931
STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS NOT

00:42:46.997 --> 00:42:49.433
PROGRESSIVE. IT IS RESTRICTIVE.

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.535
IT IS LEAVING THIS PURCHASING UP

00:42:51.602 --> 00:42:54.738
TO A INDIVIDUAL TO CHOOSE WHO'S

00:42:54.805 --> 00:42:56.307
GOING TO GET THIS BUSINESS

00:42:56.373 --> 00:42:59.109
SIMPLY BY WHO THEY CONTACT. AND

00:42:59.176 --> 00:43:00.778
IF THEY DON'T WANT TO CONTACT

00:43:00.844 --> 00:43:04.181
SOMEONE WHO IS BECAUSE OF THEIR

00:43:04.248 --> 00:43:07.818
GENDER, BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE,

00:43:07.885 --> 00:43:10.587
BECAUSE OF LGBTQ, BECAUSE

00:43:10.654 --> 00:43:12.489
THEY'RE A VETERAN, THEY DO NOT

00:43:12.556 --> 00:43:14.825
HAVE TO CONTACT THEM. THEY PICK

00:43:14.892 --> 00:43:16.660
AND CHOOSE WHO THEY WANT TO, WHO

00:43:16.727 --> 00:43:18.595
WHO'S GOING TO GET THIS BUSINESS

00:43:18.662 --> 00:43:20.631
BY THAT? IT'S NOT OPEN TO

00:43:20.698 --> 00:43:23.367
EVERYONE. MANDATORY CONTRACTS.

00:43:23.434 --> 00:43:25.069
THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL

00:43:25.135 --> 00:43:27.604
SERVICES ARE OPEN TO ANYONE.

00:43:27.671 --> 00:43:28.238
LOWEST RESPONSIBLE BIDDER WINS

00:43:28.305 --> 00:43:31.809
THE BIDS. I CAN TELL YOU BY

00:43:31.875 --> 00:43:33.410
INCREASING THE VALUE OF THIS. IT

00:43:33.477 --> 00:43:34.979
PUTS IT MORE IN THE HANDS OF

00:43:35.045 --> 00:43:36.380
LARGE BUSINESS. THANK YOU SIR.

00:43:36.447 --> 00:43:38.382
THAT CONCLUDES YOUR TWO MINUTES.

00:43:38.449 --> 00:43:39.416
DO YOU WANT TO FINISH? YOU HAVE

00:43:39.483 --> 00:43:40.851
ONE MINUTE AND 31 SECONDS

00:43:40.918 --> 00:43:42.453
REMAINING. WE HAVE FOUND A VERY

00:43:42.519 --> 00:43:43.821
DISTURBING TREND GOING ON HERE.

00:43:43.887 --> 00:43:46.223
AND THIS IS THE HUGE MEGA

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:48.826
COMPANIES ARE FORMING SMALL

00:43:48.892 --> 00:43:50.828
COMPANIES TO BE ABLE TO TAKE

00:43:50.894 --> 00:43:52.696
ADVANTAGE OF THE SMALL BUSINESS.

00:43:52.763 --> 00:43:55.199
THE LOOPHOLE IS THEY CAN OPERATE

00:43:55.265 --> 00:43:56.834
FOR A YEAR WITHOUT HAVING TO

00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:58.268
PROVIDE TAX RETURNS BECAUSE

00:43:58.335 --> 00:43:59.370
THEY'RE A NEW BUSINESS, SO THEY

00:43:59.436 --> 00:44:02.172
DON'T HAVE TAX RETURNS. SO MR.

00:44:02.239 --> 00:44:03.607
SIMPSON IS GOING AGAINST THESE

00:44:03.674 --> 00:44:05.642
HUGE MEGA COMPANIES THAT HAVE

00:44:05.709 --> 00:44:07.611
THESE LITTLE MOM AND POPS THAT

00:44:07.678 --> 00:44:10.748
THEY'RE FOSTERING AND SKIRTING

THAT DOLLAR AMOUNT IS, THEY HAVE

00:44:32.403 --> 00:44:34.304

SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE THAT KIND

00:44:35.672 --> 00:44:37.441

00:50:14.411 --> 00:50:17.414
REAL. PORTS FACE LONG TURNAROUND

TIME, MANY PORTS ARE IN URGENT

00:51:11.668 --> 00:51:14.070
NEEDS OF INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES

00:51:14.137 --> 00:51:16.206

SHORTFALLS MAKE SUCH INVESTMENTS

00:51:22.879 --> 00:51:24.548
INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT,

00:51:24.614 --> 00:51:27.017
CONTINUALLY UNCERTAIN AROUND

00:51:27.083 --> 00:51:29.186
TARIFFS THREATENS NOT JUST

00:51:29.252 --> 00:51:31.321
CURRENT OPERATIONS, BUT ALSO

00:51:31.388 --> 00:51:34.424
FUTURE TRADE AGREEMENTS AND LONG

PRIORITIZE AND MAINTAIN

00:51:50.907 --> 00:51:52.642
PRIORITIES ON POLICY

00:51:52.709 --> 00:51:53.977
DISCUSSIONS? BECAUSE CALIFORNIA

00:51:54.044 --> 00:51:56.279
PORTS SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE A

00:51:56.346 --> 00:51:57.347
FOUNDATION OF OUR FUTURE HERE IN

00:51:57.414 --> 00:51:59.749

THE IMPOSITION OF TARIFFS COULD

01:16:50.605 --> 01:16:52.674
HAVE A DIRECT AND ADVERSE IMPACT

THINK THAT WE NEED TO THINK

01:27:24.305 --> 01:27:25.340
OUTSIDE THE BOX, CREATE

01:27:25.406 --> 01:27:27.175
ADDITIONAL TOOLS THAT WILL ALLOW

01:27:27.241 --> 01:27:29.711

01:27:30.912 --> 01:27:32.246
IN COMMUNITIES LIKE THE ONES

01:27:32.313 --> 01:27:34.349
THAT WE COMMONLY REPRESENT. WE

01:27:34.415 --> 01:27:36.618
REALLY NEED TO THINK OUTSIDE THE

THINKING ABOUT OUR COMMUNITY,

01:27:43.458 --> 01:27:44.592
BUT I THINK COMMUNITIES ACROSS

01:27:44.659 --> 01:27:45.793
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT

01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:47.295
NEED THAT TYPE OF INVESTMENT,

01:27:47.362 --> 01:27:49.797
AND ALSO LOOKING AT PUBLIC AND

01:27:49.864 --> 01:27:51.332
PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS WHERE WHICH

01:27:51.399 --> 01:27:53.635
ARE EXTREMELY CRITICAL AND CAN

01:27:53.701 --> 01:27:55.570
BE GAME CHANGERS IN MANY OF OUR

01:27:55.637 --> 01:27:57.505

01:28:16.991 --> 01:28:18.159
CHALLENGES THAT THE STATE FACES

01:28:18.226 --> 01:28:20.194

I'M A BIG BELIEVER IN PUBLIC

01:28:35.443 --> 01:28:36.511
TRANSPARENCY. IT'S ONE OF THE

01:28:36.577 --> 01:28:39.113
REASONS THAT I HAVE NOT

01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:43.851

MORE TRANSPARENCY WE CAN WE CAN

HAVE, THE BETTER, BETTER OFF WE

01:29:01.636 --> 01:29:04.272
ARE. THE I THINK THIS BILL COULD

01:29:04.338 --> 01:29:05.673
PROVIDE US WITH A REALLY

01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:07.275
