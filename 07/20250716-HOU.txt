00:56:48.938 --> 00:56:50.273
ALSO IN FRESNO COUNTY, SOME

00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:51.574
RESIDENTS HAVE SWAMP COOLERS,

00:56:51.641 --> 00:56:53.143
BUT THOSE ARE INCREASINGLY

00:56:53.209 --> 00:56:54.644
INEFFECTIVE AS HEAT BECOMES MORE

00:56:54.711 --> 00:56:56.713
EXTREME AND MORE INTENSE, THEY

00:56:56.780 --> 00:56:58.515
LOSE THEIR COOLING CAPACITY AS

00:56:58.581 --> 00:56:59.949
TEMPERATURES RISE OVER 95

00:57:00.016 --> 00:57:01.818
DEGREES. AND WHAT'S MORE, THEY

00:57:01.885 --> 00:57:03.520
DRAW POLLUTION INSIDE HOMES.

00:57:03.586 --> 00:57:05.021
LAST YEAR, ONE RESIDENT SHARED

00:57:05.088 --> 00:57:06.990
THAT SHE HAD HER SWAMP COOLER

00:57:07.056 --> 00:57:08.391
RUNNING WHILE PESTICIDES WERE

00:57:08.458 --> 00:57:09.726
APPLIED OUTSIDE OF HER HOUSE.

00:57:09.793 --> 00:57:11.027
THE SWAMP COOLERS MAY COOL DOWN

00:57:11.094 --> 00:57:13.463
AN ENVIRONMENT TO SOME EXTENT IN

00:57:13.530 --> 00:57:14.430
CERTAIN CONDITIONS. THEY OFFER

00:57:14.497 --> 00:57:16.166
NO FILTRATION OF PARTICLES OR

00:57:16.232 --> 00:57:18.501
TOXICS, AND RUNNING THE SWAMP

00:57:18.568 --> 00:57:20.203
COOLER EVEN EXPOSED TO

00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:22.972
PESTICIDES. WE SUPPORT SB 655

00:57:23.039 --> 00:57:24.374
BECAUSE IT PROTECTS THE

00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:25.208
WELL-BEING AND HEALTH OF OUR

00:57:25.275 --> 00:57:26.676
MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS IN

00:57:29.946 --> 00:57:32.148
THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS CAN BE

00:57:32.215 --> 00:57:34.484

ROOM HERE IN OPPOSITION AT ALL,

00:59:02.839 --> 00:59:05.642
NOT SEEING ANYONE. FANTASTIC.

00:59:05.708 --> 00:59:07.777
ALL RIGHT. I WILL BRING IT BACK

00:59:07.844 --> 00:59:09.345
TO THE COMMITTEE. WE DON'T YET

00:59:09.412 --> 00:59:13.216
HAVE A QUORUM YET, BUT I WILL,

00:59:13.283 --> 00:59:16.019
MISTER PATTERSON. GREAT. THANK

00:59:16.085 --> 00:59:19.055
YOU. I KNOW THIS BILL IS A

00:59:19.122 --> 00:59:20.056
LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN FROM WHEN

00:59:20.123 --> 00:59:22.225
IT LEFT THE SENATE. WHERE? IN

00:59:22.292 --> 00:59:24.127
THE SENATE, I THINK IT DEFINED

00:59:24.193 --> 00:59:26.195
82 DEGREES, I BELIEVE. SEEMS

00:59:26.262 --> 00:59:27.864
LIKE THE SPIRIT IS PRETTY MUCH

00:59:27.931 --> 00:59:30.466
THE SAME, BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE A

00:59:30.533 --> 00:59:32.702
NUMBER TIED TO IT. AND I JUST

00:59:32.769 --> 00:59:34.103
WANTED TO SEE WHAT YOUR LINE OF

00:59:34.170 --> 00:59:37.073
THINKING WAS ON THAT. WE'RE

00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:39.108
TRYING TO GIVE SOME FLEXIBILITY

00:59:39.175 --> 00:59:40.944
TO THE STATE AGENCIES AS THEY

00:59:41.010 --> 00:59:42.712
IMPLEMENT REGULATIONS, AND THIS

00:59:42.779 --> 00:59:44.614
REALLY ISN'T DESIGNED TO BE A

00:59:44.681 --> 00:59:47.116
MANDATE AS MUCH AS, AS AS I

00:59:47.183 --> 00:59:50.620
THINK OUR COALITION WANTS TO

00:59:50.687 --> 00:59:52.188
HAVE THAT CODIFICATION RIGHT NOW

00:59:52.255 --> 00:59:54.390
IN STATE LAWS, DO I HAVE FOR

00:59:54.457 --> 00:59:56.826
EXISTING AND NEW BUILDINGS? THE

00:59:56.893 --> 00:59:58.361
BILL IS REALLY JUST DESIGNED TO

00:59:58.428 --> 00:59:59.996
SET SOME POLICY AROUND THAT

01:00:00.063 --> 01:00:02.899
RECENT REPORT AND, YOU KNOW,

01:00:02.966 --> 01:00:05.735
SHOULD SHOULD SCIENCE CHANGE OR

01:00:05.802 --> 01:00:06.970
STUDIES EVOLVE? YOU KNOW, WE'RE

01:00:07.036 --> 01:00:08.738
GOING TO BE WE WANT TO LEAVE

01:00:08.805 --> 01:00:11.174
SOME FLEXIBILITY AS WE IMPLEMENT

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:13.042
THOSE POLICIES. IT ALSO IT YOU

01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:15.778
KNOW, THERE IS SOME REGIONAL

01:00:15.845 --> 01:00:17.580
DIFFERENTIAL IN TERMS OF HEAT

01:00:17.647 --> 01:00:20.516
IMPACT. SO YOU KNOW IT MAY ALSO

01:00:20.583 --> 01:00:22.852
DEPEND ON REGION. BUT I WOULD

01:00:22.919 --> 01:00:25.088
TURN TO MY WITNESSES IF THEY HAD

01:00:25.154 --> 01:00:27.390
ANY FURTHER INSIGHT. NO I THINK

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:29.959
YOU'RE CORRECT. IT'S RIGHT NOW I

01:00:30.026 --> 01:00:31.694
THINK WE THE, THE PURPOSE OF

01:00:31.761 --> 01:00:34.163
THIS BILL IS MOSTLY TO LAY A

01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:35.965
GROUNDWORK AND LEAVE THAT

01:00:36.032 --> 01:00:38.534
FLEXIBILITY. AND AS THE SENATOR

01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:40.136
POINTED OUT, I MEAN, REGIONS ARE

01:00:40.203 --> 01:00:42.038
REALLY DIFFERENT. I MEAN, SOME

01:00:42.105 --> 01:00:46.776
DON'T NEED AS MUCH COOLING

01:00:46.843 --> 01:00:47.910
MECHANISMS AS OTHERS DO. THERE

01:00:47.977 --> 01:00:49.979
MIGHT BE DIFFERENT TYPES. SO I

01:00:50.046 --> 01:00:52.782
THINK GOING BACK AND ALLOWING

01:00:52.849 --> 01:00:54.217
STATE AGENCIES TO REALLY LOOK AT

01:00:54.283 --> 01:01:00.957
THAT. YEAH. OKAY. WELL I YOU

01:01:01.024 --> 01:01:02.992
KNOW, I THINK THE WAY IT LEFT

01:01:03.059 --> 01:01:05.461
THE SENATE I UNDERSTAND WHAT

01:01:05.528 --> 01:01:06.262
YOU'RE, WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

01:01:06.329 --> 01:01:09.866
DO. I THINK I ACTUALLY I KIND OF

01:01:09.932 --> 01:01:13.069
I LIKE WHAT YOUR RESPONSE

01:01:13.136 --> 01:01:14.804
SOMEWHAT. I GUESS THE CONCERN I

01:01:14.871 --> 01:01:16.973
HAVE, I'M LEANING TOWARDS

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.108
SUPPORTING THE BILL. I THINK THE

01:01:19.175 --> 01:01:24.580
CONCERN I HAVE IS. IS WITHOUT A

01:01:24.647 --> 01:01:27.884
THRESHOLD, SOME KIND OF LIMIT OR

01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:30.386
SOME KIND OF MAXIMUM. I AM A

01:01:30.453 --> 01:01:31.888
LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THAT

01:01:31.954 --> 01:01:34.057
COULD MEAN, AND ESPECIALLY TO

01:01:34.123 --> 01:01:36.092
OUR GRID. I HAPPEN TO BE ON THE

01:01:36.159 --> 01:01:37.293
UTILITIES VICE CHAIR UTILITIES

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:38.961
AS WELL, WHICH WILL BE MEETING.

01:01:39.028 --> 01:01:39.896
AND I KNOW YOU HAVE THINGS IN

01:01:39.962 --> 01:01:42.198
THAT AREA AS WELL WORRIED ABOUT

01:01:42.265 --> 01:01:43.966
WHAT IT COULD MEAN TO OUR GRID.

01:01:44.033 --> 01:01:45.068
FOR EXAMPLE, IF A STATE AGENCY

01:01:45.134 --> 01:01:47.270
SAID, HEY, IT'S GOT TO BE 78

01:01:47.336 --> 01:01:48.171
DEGREES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

01:01:48.237 --> 01:01:50.840
YOU KNOW? SO I GREW UP WITHOUT

01:01:50.907 --> 01:01:54.177
AIR CONDITIONING AND IN A

01:01:54.243 --> 01:01:55.645
DIFFERENT COMMUNITY WHERE LIKE

01:01:55.711 --> 01:01:57.780
82 DEGREES IS DIFFERENT THAN 82

01:01:57.847 --> 01:01:59.115
DEGREES, WHERE I'M FROM NOW IN

01:01:59.182 --> 01:02:00.883
ROCKLIN, IF WE HAD 82 DEGREES IN

01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:02.919
ROCKLAND DURING THE SUMMER, THAT

01:02:02.985 --> 01:02:04.087
WOULD BE AMAZING. BUT WE NEVER

01:02:04.153 --> 01:02:05.455
DO. IT'S LIKE 105 OR SOMETHING.

01:02:05.521 --> 01:02:08.524
SO. SO I GET THE REGIONAL

01:02:08.591 --> 01:02:10.760
APPROACH, BUT I DO HAVE SOME

01:02:10.827 --> 01:02:12.128
CONCERNS WITH THE IMPACT ON OUR

01:02:12.195 --> 01:02:14.263
GRID. IF THE WITH ALL DUE

01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:15.398
RESPECT TO YOUR WITNESSES, IF

01:02:15.465 --> 01:02:16.866
THE ADVOCACY GROUPS COME IN AND

01:02:16.933 --> 01:02:18.468
SAY, HEY, IT SHOULD BE 78

01:02:18.534 --> 01:02:19.268
DEGREES, FOR EXAMPLE, BECAUSE

01:02:19.335 --> 01:02:21.737
THAT IS COULD BE A LOT DURING

01:02:21.804 --> 01:02:23.539
THOSE PEAK HOURS, AND FEEL FREE

01:02:23.606 --> 01:02:25.074
TO RESPOND TO THAT. BUT I'M

01:02:25.141 --> 01:02:26.943
LEANING TOWARDS SUPPORTING THIS

01:02:27.009 --> 01:02:30.113
BILL. THANKS. I WOULD JUST SAY

01:02:30.179 --> 01:02:31.180
YOU'RE RIGHT TO HAVE THOSE

01:02:31.247 --> 01:02:32.615
CONCERNS ABOUT THE GRID. I MEAN,

01:02:32.682 --> 01:02:34.917
RIGHT NOW HEAT IS, YOU KNOW,

01:02:34.984 --> 01:02:36.052
ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S HEAT AND

01:02:36.119 --> 01:02:37.520
FIRE AT THE SAME EXACT TIME.

01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:38.621
THAT'S THOSE ARE THE MOMENTS

01:02:38.688 --> 01:02:40.223
WHEN WE GET INTO BLACKOUT

01:02:40.289 --> 01:02:41.157
TERRITORY WHERE THE CAPACITY

01:02:41.224 --> 01:02:42.391
DOES GET STRAIN, TRANSMISSION

01:02:42.458 --> 01:02:44.527
LINES GET STRAINED. YOU KNOW, WE

01:02:44.594 --> 01:02:46.996
SEE IT IN MY OWN BACKYARD, LIKE

01:02:47.063 --> 01:02:48.664
I GREW UP NEAR THE BEACH AT THE

01:02:48.731 --> 01:02:50.099
PRIVILEGE OF DOING THAT. NOW

01:02:50.166 --> 01:02:52.635
THAT I'M A RENTER AND I'M LIVING

01:02:52.702 --> 01:02:54.770
INLAND, YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE 110.

01:02:54.837 --> 01:02:58.141
IT HIT 121, ACTUALLY NEAR MY

01:02:58.207 --> 01:03:00.309
PLACE. AND I GOT TWO LITTLE

01:03:00.376 --> 01:03:03.613
BABIES NOW. SO, YOU KNOW, EVEN

01:03:03.679 --> 01:03:05.815
FOR ME, IT'S LIKE EVEN 82

01:03:05.882 --> 01:03:07.049
SOUNDS, I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T

01:03:07.116 --> 01:03:08.384
KNOW, IMPOSSIBLE WHEN I'M TRYING

01:03:08.451 --> 01:03:10.219
TO PUT A TWO YEAR OLD TO SLEEP.

01:03:10.286 --> 01:03:12.788
LIKE, I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO

01:03:12.855 --> 01:03:15.091
DO THAT. BUT AS MUCH AS I WOULD

01:03:15.158 --> 01:03:17.793
LIKE TO SORT OF SET SOME NUMBER,

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:20.429
CLEARLY IN LAW WE THINK SAFETY

01:03:20.496 --> 01:03:23.432
IS SORT OF THE KEY METRIC HERE.

01:03:23.499 --> 01:03:27.737
SO YEAH, I THINK IT'S A GOOD

01:03:27.803 --> 01:03:29.739
PIECE OF FEEDBACK. AND PERHAPS

01:03:29.805 --> 01:03:32.141
IN TERMS OF STATE AGENCIES THAT

01:03:32.208 --> 01:03:32.742
WE CALL IT, BECAUSE THE

01:03:32.808 --> 01:03:33.910
COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ACTUALLY DO

01:03:33.976 --> 01:03:35.978
A GOOD JOB OF TRYING TO MAKE US

01:03:36.045 --> 01:03:36.812
BE SPECIFIC ABOUT EXACTLY WHICH

01:03:36.879 --> 01:03:38.581
STATE AGENCIES ARE DOING THESE

01:03:38.648 --> 01:03:39.682
CONSIDERATIONS. I KNOW THE CDC

01:03:39.749 --> 01:03:41.651
IS DOING SORT OF INTEGRATING

01:03:41.717 --> 01:03:44.720
THAT HEAT INTO THEIR THEIR JOINT

01:03:44.787 --> 01:03:46.155
PLANNING MODELS RIGHT NOW. SO

01:03:46.222 --> 01:03:47.990
THEY DELIVER US A REPORT EVERY

01:03:48.057 --> 01:03:49.325
YEAR ON SORT OF WHAT NEW

01:03:49.392 --> 01:03:50.893
CAPACITY DO WE HAVE TO ADD TO

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.962
THE GRID IF EVERYONE TURNS ON

01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:54.764
THEIR AC ALL AT THE SAME TIME IN

01:03:54.830 --> 01:03:55.998
HEAT DOMES THAT SAY LAST A

01:03:56.065 --> 01:03:58.234
MONTH, RIGHT? LIKE, CAN WE MAKE

01:03:58.301 --> 01:03:59.468
IT? BUT I'M OPEN TO SORT OF

01:03:59.535 --> 01:04:00.937
DRILLING DOWN ON THAT A LITTLE

01:04:01.003 --> 01:04:01.904
MORE AND GIVING SOME PARAMETERS

01:04:01.971 --> 01:04:03.873
SO THAT WE DON'T SORT OF

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:04.907
INADVERTENTLY BACK OUR WAY INTO

01:04:04.974 --> 01:04:06.275
AN ENERGY CRISIS. ALTHOUGH I

01:04:06.342 --> 01:04:08.044
HATE TO SAY IT, BUT I THINK

01:04:08.110 --> 01:04:09.478
WE'RE THERE. LIKE, I ACTUALLY

01:04:09.545 --> 01:04:11.881
THINK WE DO NEED TO GET SERIOUS

01:04:11.948 --> 01:04:13.349
ABOUT IT. AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S

01:04:13.416 --> 01:04:15.251
WHY WE'RE WORKING ON HOW TO

01:04:15.318 --> 01:04:16.786
SHARE POWER DURING PEAK PERIODS

01:04:16.852 --> 01:04:17.887
WITH OTHER STATES THAT MAYBE

01:04:17.954 --> 01:04:19.155
AREN'T IN THE HEAT WAVE AND

01:04:19.222 --> 01:04:20.756
THINGS LIKE THAT. BUT I TAKE

01:04:20.823 --> 01:04:23.259
YOUR POINT AND I'LL I'LL WORK ON

01:04:23.326 --> 01:04:24.060
IT. SO THANK YOU. YEAH. MISS

01:04:24.126 --> 01:04:31.067
QUIRK-SILVA. THANK YOU. AND, YOU

01:04:31.133 --> 01:04:34.036
KNOW, WE DO A LOT OF THESE KIND

01:04:34.103 --> 01:04:35.104
OF STATEMENTS, STATEMENTS OF WE

01:04:35.171 --> 01:04:37.106
ALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO HOUSING.

01:04:37.173 --> 01:04:42.178
WE ALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO. WATER,

01:04:42.245 --> 01:04:45.848
CLEAN WATER, SAFE SCHOOLS SAFE.

01:04:45.915 --> 01:04:47.316
AND YOU KNOW, THOSE ARE

01:04:47.383 --> 01:04:49.819
IMPORTANT VALUES TO STATE

01:04:49.885 --> 01:04:51.120
FORMALLY. AND SO I DO SUPPORT

01:04:51.187 --> 01:04:55.258
THIS. IT SAYS TO ALL DWELLINGS.

01:04:55.324 --> 01:04:56.759
AND AGAIN I'M JUST KIND OF BEING

01:04:56.826 --> 01:04:58.761
A LITTLE BIT OUT THERE IF WE'RE

01:04:58.828 --> 01:05:00.396
GOING TO DO ALL, ARE WE ALSO

01:05:00.463 --> 01:05:03.466
INCLUDING WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

01:05:03.532 --> 01:05:05.701
DWELLINGS PRISONS. AND IF NOT,

01:05:05.768 --> 01:05:07.336
IS THAT SOMETHING WE COULD LOOK

01:05:07.403 --> 01:05:09.972
AT? BECAUSE I VISITED SEVERAL

01:05:10.039 --> 01:05:12.141
PRISONS IN THE LAST YEAR IN

01:05:12.208 --> 01:05:16.746
CALIFORNIA IN THE SUMMER. AND

01:05:16.812 --> 01:05:18.047
SPEAKING OF HEAT, WE'RE TALKING

01:05:18.114 --> 01:05:22.518
ABOUT 110 DEGREES AND SINGLE

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:26.188
CELL WITH TWO PEOPLE. THAT IS

01:05:26.255 --> 01:05:28.024
EXTREMELY WITH, YOU KNOW, AND

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:29.358
THIS HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP IN

01:05:29.425 --> 01:05:30.960
PUBLIC SAFETY NUMEROUS TIMES.

01:05:31.027 --> 01:05:32.728
WHEN ARE WE GOING TO LOOK AT

01:05:32.795 --> 01:05:33.963
THAT? SO IT'S JUST SOMETHING TO

01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:36.899
ADD IN THAT KIND OF TIES IN. BUT

01:05:36.966 --> 01:05:37.900
YOU KNOW I KNOW IT'S NOT PART OF

01:05:37.967 --> 01:05:40.236
THE BILL HERE, BUT IT WOULD BE

01:05:40.303 --> 01:05:42.405
SOMETHING TO CONSIDER AND THINK

01:05:42.471 --> 01:05:44.173
ABOUT. AS WE KNOW, WE HAVE

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:46.275
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN THESE

01:05:46.342 --> 01:05:51.580
VERY CLOSED SPACES. NO

01:05:51.647 --> 01:05:54.183
VENTILATION, OF COURSE, NO

01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:55.951
WINDOWS. SO IT MIGHT BE

01:05:56.018 --> 01:05:58.788
SOMETHING, BUT I DO. I MOVE THE

01:05:58.854 --> 01:06:02.825
BILL, I APPRECIATE THAT. CAN WE

01:06:02.892 --> 01:06:05.761
ESTABLISH QUORUM? OF COURSE.

01:06:05.828 --> 01:06:08.664
HANEY, PRESIDENT HANEY HERE.

01:06:08.731 --> 01:06:10.499
PATTERSON. PATTERSON HERE. ÃVILA

01:06:10.566 --> 01:06:13.536
FARÃAS. CARLOS GARCIA. GARCIA

01:06:13.602 --> 01:06:16.539
HERE. CHOLERA. CHOLERA HERE.

01:06:16.605 --> 01:06:19.075
LEE. HERE. LEE HERE.

01:06:19.141 --> 01:06:20.943
QUIRK-SILVA. QUIRK-SILVA HERE TO

01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:23.679
TYPEKIT. WICKS. WILSON. WILSON

01:06:23.746 --> 01:06:27.316
HERE. ALL RIGHT. WE HAVE A

01:06:27.383 --> 01:06:30.953
QUORUM, MISS WILSON. THANK YOU

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:33.022
TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS

01:06:33.089 --> 01:06:35.658
FORWARD AND ATTEMPTING TO TRY TO

01:06:35.725 --> 01:06:37.927
SOLVE THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. AS

01:06:37.993 --> 01:06:39.662
WE KNOW, WE HAVE THE MINIMUM

01:06:39.729 --> 01:06:41.130
THRESHOLD, AND IT'S IDENTIFIED

01:06:41.197 --> 01:06:43.532
BY A NUMBER BECAUSE OF THE

01:06:43.599 --> 01:06:45.768
IMPACTS. WE KNOW CLEARLY IT'S

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:47.470
UNSAFE FOR MOST PEOPLE AT A

01:06:47.536 --> 01:06:49.372
CERTAIN TEMPERATURE BELOW. AND

01:06:49.438 --> 01:06:50.740
THEN NOW DEALING WITH THE

01:06:50.806 --> 01:06:51.841
CLIMATE CRISIS, WHERE WE'RE

01:06:51.907 --> 01:06:53.242
SEEING RISING TEMPERATURES, SO

01:06:53.309 --> 01:06:54.677
MUCH SO THAT EVEN ALASKA NOW HAS

01:06:54.744 --> 01:06:56.946
ITS OWN NOTIFICATION SYSTEM THAT

01:06:57.012 --> 01:06:58.347
THEY NEVER REALLY HAD TO HAVE

01:06:58.414 --> 01:07:02.017
BEFORE, THAT THERE IS THERE IS A

01:07:02.084 --> 01:07:03.319
MAXIMUM. RIGHT. AND SO WHAT

01:07:03.386 --> 01:07:05.221
CONCERNS ME IS THE FACT THAT

01:07:05.287 --> 01:07:07.656
IT'S NOT IDENTIFIED. AND I KNOW

01:07:07.723 --> 01:07:08.290
THAT'S BEEN AMENDED OUT. AND I

01:07:08.357 --> 01:07:10.659
DO THINK THAT IT LENDS TO THE

01:07:10.726 --> 01:07:12.762
ARGUMENT OF IT BEING BROAD AND

01:07:12.828 --> 01:07:14.563
VAGUE. AND WHAT WILL INDIVIDUAL

01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:16.599
REGIONS DO AND THOSE TYPES OF

01:07:16.665 --> 01:07:18.401
THINGS. AND SO AND IT IS MORE

01:07:18.467 --> 01:07:21.337
ABOUT BEING SAFE, NOT AT

01:07:21.404 --> 01:07:22.772
CONVENIENCE. LIKE FOR INSTANCE,

01:07:22.838 --> 01:07:25.141
YOU KNOW, I FEEL SAFE EVEN

01:07:25.207 --> 01:07:26.475
THOUGH IT'S A CONVENIENCE AT 72,

01:07:26.542 --> 01:07:28.577
NO MORE THAN 72, I HAVE A VERY

01:07:28.644 --> 01:07:29.678
SHORT RANGE OF BETWEEN BEING

01:07:29.745 --> 01:07:31.247
COLD AND HOT. YEAH. WHICH IS

01:07:31.313 --> 01:07:32.848
WEIRD BECAUSE I'M A DAUGHTER OF

01:07:32.915 --> 01:07:34.150
THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND SO ONCE

01:07:34.216 --> 01:07:35.985
I'VE GOTTEN FROM THE CENTRAL

01:07:36.051 --> 01:07:36.819
VALLEY TO THE NORTH, MY

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:38.387
TOLERANCE HAS DROPPED REALLY

01:07:38.454 --> 01:07:39.355
LOW. HOWEVER, WHEN I GET ON THE

01:07:39.422 --> 01:07:41.590
PHONE WITH MY SISTER WHO LIVES

01:07:41.657 --> 01:07:42.925
IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA, I AM NOT

01:07:42.992 --> 01:07:43.926
ABOUT I CANNOT COMPLAIN AT ALL

01:07:43.993 --> 01:07:45.661
ABOUT IT BEING HOT DAY. SHE

01:07:45.728 --> 01:07:46.695
REFUSES IT. SHE STOPS ME RIGHT

01:07:46.762 --> 01:07:48.431
AWAY AND SHE WAS LIKE, EXCUSE

01:07:48.497 --> 01:07:49.965
ME? AND SHE TELLS ME WHAT THE

01:07:50.032 --> 01:07:51.700
TEMPERATURE IS, RIGHT? SO BUT I

01:07:51.767 --> 01:07:53.569
DO THINK WHEN WE DON'T HAVE A

01:07:53.636 --> 01:07:55.438
NUMBER IN IT, IT PRECLUDES ME.

01:07:55.504 --> 01:07:55.905
SO, SO I'M GOING TO BE

01:07:55.971 --> 01:07:57.640
SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY. AND

01:07:57.706 --> 01:08:00.609
I THINK THAT FROM AN INCREMENTAL

01:08:00.676 --> 01:08:01.977
APPROACH, JUST PUTTING IN THE

01:08:02.044 --> 01:08:03.846
WORD SAFE IS SUFFICIENT. BUT I

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:05.181
HOPE THAT DURING THE REST OF

01:08:05.247 --> 01:08:07.049
YOUR TIME HERE. SO NOT

01:08:07.116 --> 01:08:07.817
NECESSARILY IN THIS BILL THAT

01:08:07.883 --> 01:08:10.719
YOU BEGIN TO IDENTIFY WHAT THAT

01:08:10.786 --> 01:08:12.455
NUMBER. I KNOW THE REPORT SAID

01:08:12.521 --> 01:08:15.691
82, BUT TO HAVE IT WITHOUT SOME

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:17.226
LEVEL OF GUARDRAILS AROUND THAT,

01:08:17.293 --> 01:08:21.130
I DO THINK EXPOSES THE DIFFERENT

01:08:21.197 --> 01:08:22.531
TYPES OF DWELLING UNITS WHO ARE

01:08:22.598 --> 01:08:23.666
IN CHARGE OF THAT, LIKE

01:08:23.732 --> 01:08:25.501
LANDLORDS AND OTHERS, TO WHAT

01:08:25.568 --> 01:08:27.603
COULD BE SOME BURDENSOME

01:08:27.670 --> 01:08:29.004
REGULATION. AND SO I THINK

01:08:29.071 --> 01:08:30.172
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE

01:08:30.239 --> 01:08:31.507
LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONTINUE,

01:08:31.574 --> 01:08:33.375
COULD CONSIDER WHEN WE'RE

01:08:33.442 --> 01:08:35.945
APPROVING SOMETHING SO VAGUE. IF

01:08:36.011 --> 01:08:37.680
IT GETS TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK

01:08:37.746 --> 01:08:39.248
THAT WE SHOULD AT SOME POINT DO

01:08:39.315 --> 01:08:40.916
SOME CLEANUP AND REALLY THINK

01:08:40.983 --> 01:08:41.584
ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS

01:08:41.650 --> 01:08:42.985
REGIONALLY, OR PUT SOME

01:08:43.052 --> 01:08:45.554
ADDITIONAL GUARDRAILS ON ON WHAT

01:08:45.621 --> 01:08:48.057
YOU CAN USE, WHATEVER NUMBER THE

01:08:48.123 --> 01:08:50.960
REGION COMES UP WITH FOR. YEAH.

01:08:51.026 --> 01:08:54.930
THANK YOU. YEAH. ALL RIGHT. NOT

01:08:54.997 --> 01:08:57.366
SEEING ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR

01:08:57.433 --> 01:08:58.134
COMMENTS I'LL GIVE YOU THE

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:00.669
OPPORTUNITY TO CLOSE. THANK YOU.

01:09:00.736 --> 01:09:03.973
AND I TOO, LIKE YOU SAID MAYOR

01:09:04.039 --> 01:09:07.143
WILSON, HAVE THAT I'M A WIMP

01:09:07.209 --> 01:09:08.711
WHEN IT COMES TO HEAT. THIS IS

01:09:08.777 --> 01:09:09.979
LOVELY HERE IN COMMITTEE HERE

01:09:10.045 --> 01:09:12.515
TODAY. WE HAD SENATE JUDICIARY

01:09:12.581 --> 01:09:15.017
UNTIL LATE INTO THE NIGHT LAST

01:09:15.084 --> 01:09:16.652
NIGHT. AND THEY THEY KILLED OFF

01:09:16.719 --> 01:09:19.388
THE AC AT EIGHT. I DON'T KNOW

01:09:19.455 --> 01:09:23.225
WHY DGS IS LISTENING. PLEASE

01:09:23.292 --> 01:09:25.194
COME IN. AND THE GUY, THE GUY

01:09:25.261 --> 01:09:27.062
CAME IN WITH THE HEAT GUN JUST

01:09:27.129 --> 01:09:29.365
TO CHECK ON IT AND IT WAS JUST I

01:09:29.431 --> 01:09:30.866
DON'T KNOW, IT'S ONE OF THOSE

01:09:30.933 --> 01:09:32.334
INTERESTING MOMENTS WHERE YOU'RE

01:09:32.401 --> 01:09:33.502
LIKE REAL TIME KIND OF LIVING,

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:36.405
LIVING THROUGH IT. AND WE HAVE

01:09:36.472 --> 01:09:39.608
IT SO GOOD. I HAVE THE LUXURY OF

01:09:39.675 --> 01:09:41.010
HAVING AIR CONDITIONING IN MY

01:09:41.076 --> 01:09:43.546
HOUSE, YOU KNOW, BEING ABLE TO

01:09:43.612 --> 01:09:45.781
KEEP MY KIDS COOL AND JUST TAKE

01:09:45.848 --> 01:09:47.216
WHEN I WAS TAKING CARE OF MY

01:09:47.283 --> 01:09:49.585
IN-LAWS AT THE END OF THEIR

01:09:49.652 --> 01:09:50.819
LIVES. LIKE, IF YOU HAVE BABIES,

01:09:50.886 --> 01:09:52.021
IF YOU HAVE OLDER FOLKS LIVING

01:09:52.087 --> 01:09:53.989
WITH YOU, YOU KNOW THAT IT'S IT

01:09:54.056 --> 01:09:57.026
CAN BE LIFE OR DEATH. THIS IS

01:09:57.092 --> 01:09:59.762
FIRST CHAPTER IN WHAT I HOPE IS

01:09:59.828 --> 01:10:00.963
A LONGER TERM MISSION THAT YOU

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:01.997
ALL CAN HELP ME WITH, ESPECIALLY

01:10:02.064 --> 01:10:03.632
COMING FROM SUCH DIVERSE

01:10:03.699 --> 01:10:05.000
REGIONS. I MEAN, EVEN IN THE BAY

01:10:05.067 --> 01:10:06.435
AREA WHERE EVERYONE JUST ASSUMES

01:10:06.502 --> 01:10:08.103
IT'S ALL GOOD AND IT'S COOL, AND

01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:09.805
YOU DON'T NEED GOOD INSULATION

01:10:09.872 --> 01:10:11.707
AND YOU DON'T NEED, YOU KNOW, AN

01:10:11.774 --> 01:10:13.242
AC UNIT THAT WORKS BECAUSE JUST

01:10:13.309 --> 01:10:14.577
OPEN THE WINDOW. BUT THINGS ARE

01:10:14.643 --> 01:10:17.413
CHANGING, AND WE CAN'T JUST

01:10:17.479 --> 01:10:18.881
ASSUME THAT IT'S GOING TO BE

01:10:18.948 --> 01:10:20.683
FINE IN THE NORTH ANYMORE. SO

01:10:20.749 --> 01:10:21.917
THIS IS A STATEWIDE ISSUE. I

01:10:21.984 --> 01:10:23.385
WOULD ASK FOR ALL OF YOUR HELP

01:10:23.452 --> 01:10:25.054
IN THAT. AND I DON'T THINK WE'RE

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:26.755
JUST GOING TO GET THERE THROUGH

01:10:26.822 --> 01:10:28.190
MANDATES AND REGULATIONS ALONE,

01:10:28.257 --> 01:10:29.592
TOO. THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS

01:10:29.658 --> 01:10:31.093
WHY WE DIDN'T WANT TO, AS THIS

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:33.128
FIRST POLICY ESTABLISHMENT. STEP

01:10:33.195 --> 01:10:33.896
ONE TO DRILL TOO DEEP DOWN INTO

01:10:33.963 --> 01:10:35.164
NUMBERS OR TOO DEEP INTO A

01:10:35.230 --> 01:10:37.967
MANDATE, BECAUSE I DON'T THINK

01:10:38.033 --> 01:10:39.001
WE'RE ONLY GOING TO REGULATE OUR

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:41.937
WAY TO THIS EXTREME HEAT. GOT

01:10:42.004 --> 01:10:43.772
SHORT END OF THE STICK WHEN IT

01:10:43.839 --> 01:10:47.343
CAME TO OUR CLIMATE BOND, AND IT

01:10:47.409 --> 01:10:48.344
REMAINS AN OUTSTANDING

01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:49.111
OBLIGATION. I THINK WE GOT TO

01:10:49.178 --> 01:10:51.013
DELIVER ON THROUGH ALL OF OUR

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:51.647
CLIMATE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING OUR

01:10:51.714 --> 01:10:53.115
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND.

01:10:53.182 --> 01:10:54.950
SO IF WE CAN PRIME THE PUMP WITH

01:10:55.017 --> 01:10:56.352
SOME MEANINGFUL ASSISTANCE,

01:10:56.418 --> 01:10:57.486
ESPECIALLY OUT THERE IN THE

01:10:57.553 --> 01:10:58.988
LANDLORD TENANT ARENA, AND

01:10:59.054 --> 01:11:00.756
REALLY GET THINGS GOING AND FIND

01:11:00.823 --> 01:11:02.491
SOME PROGRAMS, THERE'S COOL LA

01:11:02.558 --> 01:11:03.892
DOWN IN LA THAT, YOU KNOW, AS

01:11:03.959 --> 01:11:05.361
SOON AS THOSE DISCOUNTED UNITS

01:11:05.427 --> 01:11:07.129
COME UP, THEY'RE OFF THE SHELF

01:11:07.196 --> 01:11:09.398
QUICK AND THEY'RE GONE. THERE IS

01:11:09.465 --> 01:11:10.966
THE DEMAND. SO I THINK WE CAN

01:11:11.033 --> 01:11:13.268
MEET IT. I HOPE THIS IS A GOOD

01:11:13.335 --> 01:11:14.837
FIRST STEP AND SORT OF JUST

01:11:14.903 --> 01:11:16.872
LEVEL SETTING THAT SAFETY IN OUR

01:11:16.939 --> 01:11:18.307
DWELLING UNITS AROUND HEAT

01:11:18.374 --> 01:11:21.076
SHOULD BE POLICY OF THE STATE OF

01:11:21.143 --> 01:11:22.711
CALIFORNIA. BUT I APPRECIATE THE

01:11:22.778 --> 01:11:25.314
POINTS MADE BY ALL THE MEMBERS,

01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:26.915
INCLUDING MY FRIEND FROM ORANGE

01:11:26.982 --> 01:11:29.385
COUNTY, ABOUT THOSE IN A

01:11:29.451 --> 01:11:30.686
CARCERAL SETTING. AND WITH THAT,

01:11:30.753 --> 01:11:32.855
I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR.

01:11:32.921 --> 01:11:34.423
THANK THANK YOU, SENATOR, AND

01:11:34.490 --> 01:11:35.724
THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP

01:11:35.791 --> 01:11:36.992
AND FOR YOUR SPONSORS AND

01:11:37.059 --> 01:11:38.394
EVERYONE WHO HAS WORKED ON THIS

01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:41.063
IMPORTANT ISSUE. I THINK AS AS

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:44.400
YOU'VE HEARD, THIS COMMITTEE IS

01:11:44.466 --> 01:11:45.134
INTERESTED IN THIS AND

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:46.568
INTERESTED IN CONTINUING TO WORK

01:11:46.635 --> 01:11:48.771
WITH WITH YOU ON THIS. YOU KNOW,

01:11:48.837 --> 01:11:52.041
THE REALITIES OF EXTREME HEAT

01:11:52.107 --> 01:11:54.176
ARE ONLY GOING TO GET MORE

01:11:54.243 --> 01:11:55.944
INTENSE AND GOING TO LIKELY BE

01:11:56.011 --> 01:11:58.013
THE WAY IN WHICH OUR RESIDENTS

01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:00.516
MOST EXPERIENCE CLIMATE CHANGE

01:12:00.582 --> 01:12:02.384
AND THE IDEA THAT THEY CAN

01:12:02.451 --> 01:12:04.153
SIMPLY RETREAT INTO THEIR HOMES

01:12:04.219 --> 01:12:06.789
AND BE SAFE IS, IS NOT THE CASE.

01:12:06.855 --> 01:12:08.791
AND CERTAINLY, UNFORTUNATELY,

01:12:08.857 --> 01:12:11.026
WILL BE LESS AND LESS THE CASE

01:12:11.093 --> 01:12:12.795
FOR MANY PEOPLE. SO WE HAVE TO

01:12:12.861 --> 01:12:14.063
MAKE SURE THAT WE TAKE THIS A

01:12:14.129 --> 01:12:16.098
WHOLE GOVERNMENT APPROACH,

01:12:16.165 --> 01:12:17.332
LOOKING AT ALL OF THE WAYS IN

01:12:17.399 --> 01:12:19.768
WHICH WE CAN AFFECT THAT. AND I

01:12:19.835 --> 01:12:20.769
APPRECIATE THE THOUGHTFUL WAY

01:12:20.836 --> 01:12:22.204
THAT YOU'VE DONE THAT. I KNOW

01:12:22.271 --> 01:12:23.639
THAT IF YOU WOULD HAVE SET A

01:12:23.706 --> 01:12:24.840
PARTICULAR DEGREE, THEN YOU

01:12:24.907 --> 01:12:26.909
WOULD HAVE MAYBE GOTTEN SOME

01:12:26.975 --> 01:12:28.711
FEEDBACK OR CRITICISM FOR THAT,

01:12:28.777 --> 01:12:30.746
AS I'M SURE, AND NOT SETTING IT.

01:12:30.813 --> 01:12:33.115
ALSO CREATE CREATE SOME SOME

01:12:33.182 --> 01:12:35.084
LEVEL OF QUESTIONING. BUT I KNOW

01:12:35.150 --> 01:12:36.585
THAT THERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE A

01:12:36.652 --> 01:12:38.721
LOT OF WORK ON THIS ISSUE AND

01:12:38.787 --> 01:12:40.255
APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP, AND

01:12:40.322 --> 01:12:42.691

DIDN'T GET IT BEFORE WE HAD

01:12:50.866 --> 01:12:52.634

SERVICE PROVIDERS PROTECTION ACT

01:17:02.084 --> 01:17:03.685
WILL PROHIBIT LOCAL AND STATE

01:17:03.752 --> 01:17:04.753
GOVERNMENT ENTITIES FROM

01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:06.555

UNHOUSED COUNT IS AT LEAST

01:17:22.938 --> 01:17:25.007
187,000 CALIFORNIANS. I'M

01:17:25.073 --> 01:17:27.476
AUTHORING SB 634 BECAUSE THE

01:17:27.542 --> 01:17:29.745
UNHOUSED CRISIS REQUIRES A

01:17:29.811 --> 01:17:31.580
SUSTAINED HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE

01:17:31.646 --> 01:17:33.915
THAT INCLUDES BACKING PROVEN

01:17:33.982 --> 01:17:36.118
EFFORTS THAT PROVIDE HOUSING,

01:17:36.184 --> 01:17:38.286
ESSENTIAL SERVICE, AND FINANCIAL

01:17:38.353 --> 01:17:40.489
SUPPORT FOR THE UNHOUSED. THE

01:17:40.555 --> 01:17:42.024
LEGISLATURE HAS ADOPTED THIS

01:17:42.090 --> 01:17:44.426
POSITION BY PROPOSING FUNDING

01:17:44.493 --> 01:17:45.627
CONTINUATION FOR EXISTING

ASSISTANCE AND PREVENTION GRANT

01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:54.102
PROGRAM. DESPITE THESE STATE

01:17:54.169 --> 01:17:55.637
COMMITMENTS, THERE ARE LOCAL

01:17:55.704 --> 01:17:57.739
GOVERNMENTS PURSUING ORDINANCES

01:17:57.806 --> 01:17:59.074
TO PERSECUTE AND NEUTRALIZE

01:17:59.141 --> 01:18:01.043
UNHOUSED SERVICE PROVIDERS WITH

01:18:01.109 --> 01:18:02.744
THREATS OF APPLYING FINES AND

01:18:02.811 --> 01:18:05.781
JAIL TIME SIMPLY FOR PROVIDING

01:18:05.847 --> 01:18:08.216
HUMANITARIAN AID. THE MOST

01:18:08.283 --> 01:18:09.718
RECENT AND GLARING EXAMPLE OF

01:18:09.785 --> 01:18:11.853
THESE DRACONIAN EFFORTS INCLUDE

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:13.622
THE FREMONT CITY COUNCIL

01:18:13.688 --> 01:18:15.090
ADOPTING AN ORDINANCE EARLIER

01:18:15.157 --> 01:18:17.159
THIS YEAR THAT INCLUDED LANGUAGE

01:18:17.225 --> 01:18:19.094
TO MAKE, PROVIDING AID TO

01:18:19.161 --> 01:18:22.197
PEOPLE, AIDING AND ABETTING THAT

01:18:22.264 --> 01:18:24.366
LANGUAGE HAD TO BE PULLED BACK

01:18:24.433 --> 01:18:25.534
DUE TO SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:28.036
OUTCRY. ANOTHER PREVIOUS EXAMPLE

01:18:28.103 --> 01:18:29.071
INCLUDES A GROUP OF VOLUNTEERS

01:18:29.137 --> 01:18:30.906
IN THE CITY OF EL CAJON ACTUALLY

01:18:30.972 --> 01:18:33.742
BEING ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH

01:18:33.809 --> 01:18:35.243
MISDEMEANORS FOR PROVIDING FOOD

01:18:35.310 --> 01:18:37.779
AND CLOTHING TO UNHOUSED PEOPLE.

01:18:37.846 --> 01:18:40.082
IN 2023, A CHURCH BASED

01:18:40.148 --> 01:18:42.484
NONPROFIT IN SANTA ANA, CÃC,

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:44.186
ALSO FACED PENALTIES AND

01:18:44.252 --> 01:18:45.720
CRIMINAL PROSECUTION FROM THE

01:18:45.787 --> 01:18:46.988
CITY BECAUSE IT WAS PROVIDING

01:18:47.055 --> 01:18:49.925
AID TO THE UNHOUSED OUT OF THE

01:18:49.991 --> 01:18:51.359
CHURCH'S RESOURCE CENTER. THIS

01:18:51.426 --> 01:18:52.894
CASE IS ESPECIALLY UNIQUE

01:18:52.961 --> 01:18:53.829
BECAUSE IT EVEN CAUGHT THE

01:18:53.895 --> 01:18:55.597
ATTENTION OF THE FEDERAL

01:18:55.664 --> 01:18:57.099
GOVERNMENT, WHOM OFFERED AID IN

01:18:57.165 --> 01:18:58.900
RESPONSE DUE TO ITS EGREGIOUS

01:18:58.967 --> 01:19:01.103
NATURE. IN ADDITION TO THESE

01:19:01.169 --> 01:19:02.104
ACTIONS, SOME GOVERNMENT

01:19:02.170 --> 01:19:03.939
OFFICIALS HAVE ALSO PUBLICLY

01:19:04.005 --> 01:19:05.774
SUGGESTED EVEN MORE ALARMING AND

01:19:05.841 --> 01:19:08.043
DANGEROUS IDEAS, INCLUDING

01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:09.344
ENCOURAGING UNHOUSED INDIVIDUALS

01:19:09.411 --> 01:19:11.513
TO HARM THEMSELVES BY TAKING

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:12.614
FENTANYL AS A MEANS OF

01:19:12.681 --> 01:19:14.816
ADDRESSING THE CRISIS. THESE

01:19:14.883 --> 01:19:16.985
STATEMENTS AND ACTIONS REFLECT A

01:19:17.052 --> 01:19:19.087
DISTURBING, GROWING TREND OF

01:19:19.154 --> 01:19:20.889
DEHUMANIZING UNHOUSED

01:19:20.956 --> 01:19:22.357
CALIFORNIANS AND SERVICE

01:19:22.424 --> 01:19:24.559
PROVIDERS. INSTEAD OF

01:19:24.626 --> 01:19:26.428
RECOGNIZING EXISTING RESOURCES

01:19:26.495 --> 01:19:28.330
TO AID AND HOUSE PEOPLE IN NEED

01:19:28.396 --> 01:19:30.365
WHERE THEY ARE, SOME LEADERS ARE

01:19:30.432 --> 01:19:31.633
TREATING THIS CRISIS AS A

01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:33.502
PROBLEM, TO BE PUSHED ELSEWHERE,

01:19:33.568 --> 01:19:36.805
OUT OF SIGHT AND OUT OF MIND.

01:19:36.872 --> 01:19:38.273
THIS IS SETTING A TROUBLING

01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:39.608
TREND OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:19:39.674 --> 01:19:41.076
ORDINANCES SEEKING TO APPLY

01:19:41.143 --> 01:19:42.844
PUNITIVE FINES AND JAIL TIME

01:19:42.911 --> 01:19:44.045
TOWARDS PEOPLE FOR DOING THE

01:19:44.112 --> 01:19:46.148
RIGHT THING AND PROVIDING

01:19:46.214 --> 01:19:47.682
HUMANITARIAN AID. THE ADOPTION

01:19:47.749 --> 01:19:49.751
OF ORDINANCES, APPLYING PUNITIVE

01:19:49.818 --> 01:19:51.620
FINES AND JAIL TIME TOWARDS

01:19:51.686 --> 01:19:52.921
UNHOUSED SERVICE PROVIDERS WILL

01:19:52.988 --> 01:19:54.589
NOT HELP THE UNHOUSED CRISIS,

01:19:54.656 --> 01:19:56.892
BUT EXACERBATE IT BY SEVERING

01:19:56.958 --> 01:19:58.393
CRITICAL CONNECTIONS BETWEEN

01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:00.061
UNHOUSED PEOPLE AND SERVICE

01:20:00.128 --> 01:20:01.596
PROVIDERS. THE VERY SAFETY NET

01:20:01.663 --> 01:20:03.031
THAT HELPS PEOPLE TRANSITION OUT

01:20:03.098 --> 01:20:05.300
OF HOMELESSNESS, BLOCKING

01:20:05.367 --> 01:20:07.135
SERVICE PROVIDERS FROM PROVIDING

01:20:07.202 --> 01:20:09.471
LIFE SAVING AID DEEPENS EXTREME

01:20:09.538 --> 01:20:11.773
POVERTY AND CAUSES DEVASTATING

THANK YOU. BEGIN. I FIRST OF

ALL, I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR

01:21:36.791 --> 01:21:39.027
LETTING ME SPEAK TO YOU TODAY ON

01:21:39.094 --> 01:21:40.095
THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILL, SB

01:21:40.161 --> 01:21:42.664
634. I'M A RESIDENT OF LOS

01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:45.533
ANGELES WHO SPENT OVER TEN YEARS

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:46.334
LIVING ON THE STREETS. THIS WAS

01:21:46.401 --> 01:21:48.203
VERY DIFFICULT TIMES FOR ME. NOT

01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:50.238
THAT ANYONE IS, BUT I CERTAINLY

01:21:50.305 --> 01:21:52.040
WAS NOT PREPARED FOR WHAT LAY IN

01:21:52.107 --> 01:21:53.341
FRONT OF ME. I LOST MY BUSINESS

01:21:53.408 --> 01:21:55.410
AND THE DEVASTATION OF LOSING MY

01:21:55.477 --> 01:21:56.978
MOTHER TO CANCER HAD ME LIVING

01:21:57.045 --> 01:21:58.580
IN MY FORD EXPLORER. NEARLY A

01:21:58.647 --> 01:22:00.448
YEAR WENT BY BEFORE I COULD

01:22:00.515 --> 01:22:02.250
ADMIT THAT I WAS HOMELESS. I

01:22:02.317 --> 01:22:04.019
SPENT THE MAJORITY OF THAT TIME

01:22:04.085 --> 01:22:05.053
UNSHELTERED AND ON THE STREET. I

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:07.088
HAD TO LEARN HOW TO SURVIVE

01:22:07.155 --> 01:22:09.057
QUICKLY. I LEARNED THAT THE MOST

01:22:09.124 --> 01:22:10.158
IMPORTANT THINGS WERE THE BASIC

01:22:10.225 --> 01:22:12.160
NEEDS OF LIFE FOOD, WATER,

01:22:12.227 --> 01:22:13.561
CLOTHES, SHELTER FROM THE

01:22:13.628 --> 01:22:15.163
ELEMENTS, HYGIENE, SAFETY AND

01:22:15.230 --> 01:22:17.699
HOPE. I ALMOST NEVER HAD ALL

01:22:17.766 --> 01:22:19.601
THESE THINGS AT ONCE. AND YOU'LL

01:22:19.668 --> 01:22:21.269
NOTICE THAT MEDICAL CARE AND

01:22:21.336 --> 01:22:23.004
MENTAL HEALTH DIDN'T EVEN MAKE

01:22:23.071 --> 01:22:24.873
THE LIST. WHILE I LEARNED TO

01:22:24.939 --> 01:22:27.075
DEAL WITH OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE

01:22:27.142 --> 01:22:28.443
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND

01:22:28.510 --> 01:22:30.445
THE HATE FROM THOSE WHO WERE

01:22:30.512 --> 01:22:31.446
HOUSED, I NEVER QUITE FIGURED

01:22:31.513 --> 01:22:33.014
OUT HOW TO MAKE PEACE WITH THE

01:22:33.081 --> 01:22:34.382
SWEEPS AND CITATIONS FOR

01:22:34.449 --> 01:22:36.384
SLEEPING ON THE STREET. THESE

01:22:36.451 --> 01:22:38.486
THINGS WERE ALWAYS A SETBACK.

01:22:38.553 --> 01:22:39.921
DURING A SWEEP, POLICE WOULD

01:22:39.988 --> 01:22:42.157
ARRIVE WITH SANITATION IN TOW.

01:22:42.223 --> 01:22:43.558
THEY USUALLY ARRIVED WITHOUT

01:22:43.625 --> 01:22:45.060
NOTICE. THEY WOULD TRY TO

01:22:45.126 --> 01:22:46.061
DISPOSE OF AS MUCH OF YOUR

01:22:46.127 --> 01:22:48.563
POSSESSIONS AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT

01:22:48.630 --> 01:22:51.166
OFFERING ANY SERVICES AT ALL. I

01:22:51.232 --> 01:22:52.567
ONCE HAD THE MISFORTUNE OF BEING

01:22:52.634 --> 01:22:54.069
AT A PUBLIC LIBRARY, TRYING TO

01:22:54.135 --> 01:22:56.004
FILL OUT PAPERS FOR AN OUTREACH

01:22:56.071 --> 01:22:57.672
AGENCY. UPON MY RETURN TO MY

01:22:57.739 --> 01:22:59.040
SPOT, I COULD SEE NOTHING BUT A

01:22:59.107 --> 01:23:00.709
CLEAR STREET AHEAD WHERE MY TENT

01:23:00.775 --> 01:23:02.610
AND BELONGINGS USED TO BE. I

01:23:02.677 --> 01:23:04.045
BECAME NAUSEOUS AND RAN AS FAST

01:23:04.112 --> 01:23:05.947
AS I COULD, ONLY TO SEE JUST A

01:23:06.014 --> 01:23:08.149
FEW SCRAPS OF MY THINGS LEFT,

01:23:08.216 --> 01:23:09.617
LEFT BEHIND. NO MATTER WHICH WAY

01:23:09.684 --> 01:23:10.952
I LOOK, THERE WAS NOTHING. FOR

01:23:11.019 --> 01:23:12.687
THE FIRST TIME, I WOKE UP THE

01:23:12.754 --> 01:23:14.322
NEXT MORNING WITH NOTHING FROM

01:23:14.389 --> 01:23:15.657
MY ENTIRE LIFE. ALL OF MY

01:23:15.724 --> 01:23:17.559
IMPORTANT PAPERS, MY ID, MY

01:23:17.625 --> 01:23:19.561
CLOTHES, MY FOOD, MY TENT, MY

01:23:19.627 --> 01:23:20.995
BLANKET AND JACKET, MY PICTURES

01:23:21.062 --> 01:23:22.797
OF MY DECEASED MOTHER, MY

01:23:22.864 --> 01:23:23.965
RECYCLING, MY MEMENTOS FROM

01:23:24.032 --> 01:23:25.367
CHILDHOOD AND COLLEGE AND MY

01:23:25.433 --> 01:23:27.869
TRUST IN THE SYSTEM WERE ALL

01:23:27.936 --> 01:23:29.604
GONE. I WAS CRUSHED AND LOST.

01:23:29.671 --> 01:23:31.473
EVERYTHING THAT HAD HELPED ME

01:23:31.539 --> 01:23:32.907
DEFINE WHO I WAS HAD BEEN

01:23:32.974 --> 01:23:35.176
ERASED. AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS, I

01:23:35.243 --> 01:23:36.945
STILL HAD NOT RECOVERED FROM

01:23:37.011 --> 01:23:38.980
THIS. FORTUNATELY, DURING THIS

01:23:39.047 --> 01:23:40.448
TIME, LOCAL OUTREACH GROUPS

01:23:40.515 --> 01:23:43.651
BROUGHT FOOD, WATER, A TENT AND

01:23:43.718 --> 01:23:45.320
SOME HOPE. IF IT WERE NOT FOR

01:23:45.387 --> 01:23:46.821
THEM, I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BE

01:23:46.888 --> 01:23:49.491
HERE TODAY TO SPEAK WITH YOU.

01:23:49.557 --> 01:23:51.826
DURING THOSE YEARS, I WAS CITED

01:23:51.893 --> 01:23:53.395
FOR SLEEPING ON THE SIDEWALK. I

01:23:53.461 --> 01:23:55.830
HAD NO WAY TO PAY IT, AND IT

01:23:55.897 --> 01:23:57.799
GREW TO A $900 FINE AND A

01:23:57.866 --> 01:23:59.534
WARRANT WHICH LANDED ME IN JAIL

01:23:59.601 --> 01:24:00.969
FOR THREE DAYS. OF COURSE, I

01:24:01.035 --> 01:24:03.438
RETURNED TO NOTHING. THAT SAME

01:24:03.505 --> 01:24:04.939
CITATION NEARLY COST ME MY

01:24:05.006 --> 01:24:06.374
HOUSING. ONCE I FINALLY GOT OFF

01:24:06.441 --> 01:24:07.876
THE STREET, THE APARTMENT

01:24:07.942 --> 01:24:09.377
MANAGER SAID IT CAME UP IN MY

01:24:09.444 --> 01:24:10.678
BACKGROUND CHECK AND THAT IF I

01:24:10.745 --> 01:24:12.480
DIDN'T HAVE IT REMOVED, I WOULD

01:24:12.547 --> 01:24:14.682
BE EVICTED. I HAD TO USE THE

01:24:14.749 --> 01:24:16.418
SERVICES OF INNER CITY LAW AND

01:24:16.484 --> 01:24:17.952
OTHERS IN ORDER TO GET IT

01:24:18.019 --> 01:24:20.021
REMOVED AND THE FEE WAIVED. I

01:24:20.088 --> 01:24:20.889
HAD COME PRETTY CLOSE TO LOSING

01:24:20.955 --> 01:24:22.190
MY HOUSING, SOMETHING THAT I'D

01:24:22.257 --> 01:24:24.726
WORKED SO HARD TO ACHIEVE. THE

01:24:24.793 --> 01:24:26.361
THOUGHT OF GETTING CRIMINAL OR

01:24:26.428 --> 01:24:28.730
CIVIL CHARGES FOR SIMPLY SEEKING

01:24:28.797 --> 01:24:30.732
THE BASIC NEEDS OF LIFE APPALLS

01:24:30.799 --> 01:24:33.268
ME NEARLY AS MUCH AS THE THOUGHT

01:24:33.334 --> 01:24:35.136
OF THOSE WHO HELPED US BEING

01:24:35.203 --> 01:24:38.740
PUNISHED. IT WAS SERVICES, NOT

01:24:38.807 --> 01:24:40.141
CRIMINALIZATION, THAT ENDED MY

01:24:40.208 --> 01:24:41.576
HOMELESSNESS. SERVICES BROUGHT

01:24:41.643 --> 01:24:43.378
ME SUCCESS WITH HOUSING,

01:24:43.445 --> 01:24:44.946
SOBRIETY, MEDICAL AND MENTAL

01:24:45.013 --> 01:24:46.614
HEALTH, AND A MEANS TO BE

01:24:46.681 --> 01:24:49.150
INDEPENDENT. AS AN ADVOCATE FOR

01:24:49.217 --> 01:24:51.453
THE UNHOUSED, I SERVE AND CHAIR

01:24:51.519 --> 01:24:53.521
MANY BOARDS AND COUNCILS. I DO

01:24:53.588 --> 01:24:54.589
CONSULTING WORK, PUBLIC

01:24:54.656 --> 01:24:55.723
SPEAKING, AND HAVE HAD

01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:56.825
APPEARANCES ON MEDIA OUTLETS

01:24:56.891 --> 01:24:59.060
SUCH AS CNN, PBS NEWSHOUR, THE

01:24:59.127 --> 01:25:00.295
LOS ANGELES TIMES, KTLA,

01:25:00.361 --> 01:25:02.130
SPECTRUM NEWS, KCRW, AND MANY

01:25:02.197 --> 01:25:04.999
OTHERS. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME

01:25:05.066 --> 01:25:06.801
SHARE SOME OF MY EXPERIENCES SO

01:25:06.868 --> 01:25:10.438
THAT YOU CAN MAKE BETTER

01:25:10.505 --> 01:25:13.708
INFORMED DECISIONS. GOOD

01:25:13.775 --> 01:25:14.809
MORNING, COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND

01:25:14.876 --> 01:25:16.644
MR. CHAIR, MY NAME IS ALEX

01:25:16.711 --> 01:25:18.580
VYSSOTSKY WITH THE NATIONAL

01:25:18.646 --> 01:25:19.180
ALLIANCE TO END HOMELESSNESS.

01:25:19.247 --> 01:25:20.114
OUR ORGANIZATION HAS SPENT

01:25:20.181 --> 01:25:21.883
DECADES TRACKING THE DATA, THE

01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:23.084
RESEARCH, THE BEST PRACTICES ON

01:25:23.151 --> 01:25:25.153
HOW TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. THE

01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:26.688
RESEARCH CONSISTENTLY TELLS US

01:25:26.754 --> 01:25:28.923
THAT CRIMINALIZATION NOT ONLY

01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:30.258
FAILS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS,

01:25:30.325 --> 01:25:32.427
IT MAKES IT HARDER TO SOLVE. AS

01:25:32.494 --> 01:25:33.761
MR. PLEASANTS NOTED, EVERY TIME

01:25:33.828 --> 01:25:35.597
SOMEONE LOSES ESSENTIAL

01:25:35.663 --> 01:25:36.831
DOCUMENTS, GAINS A CRIMINAL

01:25:36.898 --> 01:25:37.832
RECORD, LOSES TOUCH WITH THE

01:25:37.899 --> 01:25:40.235
CASE MANAGER, IT PROLONGS THEIR

01:25:40.301 --> 01:25:41.736
HOMELESSNESS. A RECENT STUDY

01:25:41.803 --> 01:25:43.605
LOOKED AT FOLKS WHO HAD RECEIVED

01:25:43.671 --> 01:25:45.006
FINES AND TICKETS WHILE

01:25:45.073 --> 01:25:46.808
HOMELESS, VERSUS THOSE WHO HAD

01:25:46.875 --> 01:25:48.343
NOT, AND FOUND THAT THE FINES

01:25:48.409 --> 01:25:50.011
AND TICKETS RESULTED IN PEOPLE'S

01:25:50.078 --> 01:25:51.379
EPISODE OF HOMELESSNESS BEING

01:25:51.446 --> 01:25:53.748
PROLONGED BY NEARLY TWO YEARS,

01:25:53.815 --> 01:25:55.350
EVEN WHEN CONTROLLING FOR OTHER

01:25:55.416 --> 01:25:57.118
FACTORS. SIMPLY PUT, THE INFLUX

01:25:57.185 --> 01:25:58.753
OF CRIMINALIZING ORDINANCES THAT

01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:00.121
WE'RE SEEING SINCE THE GRANTS

01:26:00.188 --> 01:26:01.990
PASS DECISION AT THE SUPREME

01:26:02.056 --> 01:26:05.126
COURT IS PROLONGING OUR CRISIS.

01:26:05.193 --> 01:26:07.228
WE DO KNOW WHAT WORKS

01:26:07.295 --> 01:26:07.962
HOMELESSNESS. IT'S THE

01:26:08.029 --> 01:26:09.564
SUPPORTIVE SERVICES THAT MEET

01:26:09.631 --> 01:26:11.399
PEOPLE WHERE THEY'RE AT, THAT

01:26:11.466 --> 01:26:11.966
MOVE PEOPLE QUICKLY OFF THE

01:26:12.033 --> 01:26:13.701
STREET AND ON A PATHWAY TO

01:26:13.768 --> 01:26:14.836
HOUSING. WE'VE SEEN THE FRUITS

01:26:14.903 --> 01:26:16.371
OF THIS IN CALIFORNIA.

01:26:16.437 --> 01:26:17.772
CALIFORNIA HAS INVESTED IN

01:26:17.839 --> 01:26:20.375
SERVICES AND HOUSING, AND NEARLY

01:26:20.441 --> 01:26:22.143
73,000 PEOPLE HAVE MOVED INTO

01:26:22.210 --> 01:26:24.045
PERMANENT HOUSING OVER THE LAST

01:26:24.112 --> 01:26:25.580
TWO YEARS, THANKS TO THE HAP AND

01:26:25.647 --> 01:26:27.448
URF PROGRAMS. THAT'S A BIG

01:26:27.515 --> 01:26:29.651
REASON WHY OVER THAT SPAN,

01:26:29.717 --> 01:26:31.019
HOMELESSNESS ROSE EIGHT TIMES

01:26:31.085 --> 01:26:32.487
FASTER OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA

01:26:32.554 --> 01:26:34.722
THAN IT DID WITHIN THE STATE.

01:26:34.789 --> 01:26:36.224
DESPITE KNOWING THAT IT'S THE

01:26:36.291 --> 01:26:37.492
SERVICES AND HOUSING THAT WORKS

01:26:37.559 --> 01:26:38.993
AND NOT THE CRIMINALIZATION.

01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:40.728
WE'RE SEEING SOME OF OUR MOST

01:26:40.795 --> 01:26:42.330
OBSTRUCTIONIST JURISDICTIONS GO

01:26:42.397 --> 01:26:44.232
SO FAR AS TO CRIMINALIZE EVEN

01:26:44.299 --> 01:26:47.302
THE DELIVERY OF SERVICES. AND WE

01:26:47.368 --> 01:26:48.670
BELIEVE THAT STRATEGY IS REALLY

01:26:48.736 --> 01:26:50.104
TO TRY AND PUSH HOMELESSNESS

01:26:50.171 --> 01:26:51.940
ONTO THEIR NEIGHBORS BY

01:26:52.006 --> 01:26:52.974
CRIMINALIZING THE VERY ACT OF

01:26:53.041 --> 01:26:55.777
PROVIDING ASSISTANCE. EVERY

01:26:55.843 --> 01:26:57.612
JURISDICTION NEEDS TO BE PART OF

01:26:57.679 --> 01:26:59.180
THE SOLUTION, AND ALLOWING

01:26:59.247 --> 01:27:00.615
CALIFORNIA'S RICH NETWORK OF

01:27:00.682 --> 01:27:02.016

01:27:02.083 --> 01:27:03.918
THEIR JOB. AS PART OF THAT,

THESE PROVIDERS, DAY IN AND DAY

01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:07.689

WHEREVER THEY MAY BE SO THEY CAN

01:27:09.724 --> 01:27:10.792
GET THEM THE SERVICES THEY NEED

01:27:10.858 --> 01:27:13.027
AND GET THEM ON A PATHWAY TO

01:27:13.094 --> 01:27:13.962
HOUSING. THEY SHOULD NOT BE

01:27:14.028 --> 01:27:15.029
FEARFUL THAT SIMPLY DOING THEIR

01:27:15.096 --> 01:27:17.165
JOBS OR DOING THAT WORK THAT IN

01:27:17.231 --> 01:27:18.366
MANY CASES IS FUNDED BY THE

01:27:18.433 --> 01:27:19.667

01:27:19.734 --> 01:27:21.869

01:29:30.765 --> 01:29:32.133
CITED IN YOUR OPENING TESTIMONY.

01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:33.534
I WANT TO THANK YOUR WITNESSES,

01:29:33.601 --> 01:29:34.602
OF COURSE, FOR ALSO SHARING YOUR

01:29:34.669 --> 01:29:36.037
EXPERIENCE. HOW DEVASTATING IT

01:29:36.104 --> 01:29:37.572
REALLY IS. I WANT TO THANK THE

01:29:37.638 --> 01:29:38.639
AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL

01:29:38.706 --> 01:29:40.374
FORWARD. AS YOU KNOW, MY CITY

01:29:40.441 --> 01:29:42.310
AND FREMONT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST

01:29:42.376 --> 01:29:43.444
TO EXPLOIT GRANTS PASS WHEN THEY

01:29:43.511 --> 01:29:44.746
FIRST CREATED AN ORDINANCE THAT

01:29:44.812 --> 01:29:46.581
WOULD CRIMINALIZE HUMANITARIAN

01:29:46.647 --> 01:29:48.883
AID FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ASSISTING

01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:51.018
PEOPLE SLEEPING ON THE STREETS,

01:29:51.085 --> 01:29:51.619
WHETHER IT BE FOOD, BLANKETS.

01:29:51.686 --> 01:29:52.687
AND THIS WAS RIGHT AROUND

01:29:52.754 --> 01:29:53.688
CHRISTMAS, YOU KNOW, RIGHT

01:29:53.755 --> 01:29:54.989
AROUND WINTER TIME TO AND IT

01:29:55.056 --> 01:29:56.791
RECEIVED SO MUCH COMMUNITY

01:29:56.858 --> 01:29:57.391
BACKLASH THAT THE, THE CITY

01:29:57.458 --> 01:29:59.494
COUNCIL HAD TO REPEAL MOST OF

01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:00.328
THAT ORDINANCE. BUT I'M GLAD

01:30:00.394 --> 01:30:01.996
THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS BILL SO

01:30:02.063 --> 01:30:04.632
THAT LESS CITY COUNCILS OUT

01:30:04.699 --> 01:30:05.933
THERE THINK ABOUT CRIMINALIZING

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.168
THE HUMANITARIAN AID. NOW, OF

01:30:07.235 --> 01:30:08.970
COURSE, YOU AND I BOTH WANTED

01:30:09.036 --> 01:30:10.371
THE ORIGINAL BILL, WHICH WOULD

01:30:10.438 --> 01:30:12.406
HAVE PROHIBITED SWEEPS AND

01:30:12.473 --> 01:30:14.075
HUMANITARIAN EVICTIONS OF PEOPLE

01:30:14.142 --> 01:30:15.076
SLEEPING ON THE STREETS. BUT I

01:30:15.143 --> 01:30:16.844
THINK THIS IS A REALLY GOOD

01:30:16.911 --> 01:30:18.579
START TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

01:30:18.646 --> 01:30:20.548
NOT CRIMINALIZING THOSE PEOPLE

01:30:20.615 --> 01:30:21.182
WHO HELP OTHER PEOPLE IN THE

01:30:21.249 --> 01:30:22.950
STREETS. AND I'M VERY PROUD TO,

01:30:23.017 --> 01:30:23.918
OF COURSE, SUPPORT IT. I WOULD

01:30:23.985 --> 01:30:26.020
LIKE TO BE AT, AS A JOINT

01:30:26.087 --> 01:30:27.955
AUTHOR, IF POSSIBLE, SO THAT WE

01:30:28.022 --> 01:30:29.590
CAN ALSO GO BACK TO OUR OWN

01:30:29.657 --> 01:30:30.958
COMMUNITIES AND SAY, THIS IS

01:30:31.025 --> 01:30:32.126
WHAT WE LEARNED FROM FREMONT'S

01:30:32.193 --> 01:30:33.694
EXAMPLE, AND WE SHOULD NOT LEARN

01:30:33.761 --> 01:30:35.463
FROM THE REST OF THE STATE. SO

01:30:35.530 --> 01:30:36.697
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING

01:30:36.764 --> 01:30:37.799
THIS FORWARD. AND I SECOND THE

01:30:37.865 --> 01:30:39.801
BILL, MISS QUIRK-SILVA. THANK

01:30:39.867 --> 01:30:42.203
YOU TO THE AUTHOR. I'M SO PROUD

01:30:42.270 --> 01:30:43.805
OF YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THIS

01:30:43.871 --> 01:30:45.773
SPACE. YOU KNOW, AS A FRESHMAN

01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:49.243
SENATOR LEGISLATOR, I'M REALLY

01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:51.045
PLEASED TO SEE THE WORK YOU'RE

01:30:51.112 --> 01:30:54.415
DOING. THERE'S SO MUCH TO SAY

01:30:54.482 --> 01:30:56.484
AND SO MUCH NOT TO SAY. IT'S

01:30:56.551 --> 01:31:03.591
JUST. SHOCKING AND DEMORALIZING

01:31:03.658 --> 01:31:07.528
THAT WE WOULD HAVE SUCH CRUELTY

01:31:07.595 --> 01:31:09.330
BEING PUT FORWARD BY SOME OF OUR

01:31:09.397 --> 01:31:11.899
CITIES, INCLUDING THE ORANGE

01:31:11.966 --> 01:31:14.769
COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. IN

01:31:14.836 --> 01:31:16.571
THE ARGUMENTS IN OPPOSITION FROM

01:31:16.637 --> 01:31:20.208
THE CITY OF CORONA. PERMISSION

01:31:20.274 --> 01:31:22.710
TO READ. YEAH, THE CITY OF

01:31:22.777 --> 01:31:25.213
CORONA. CORONA HAS WORKED HARD

01:31:25.279 --> 01:31:26.380
TO DEVELOP A SYSTEM THAT

01:31:26.447 --> 01:31:28.049
CONNECTS PEOPLE TO SHELTER

01:31:28.115 --> 01:31:30.518
SERVICES AND HOUSING TO END

01:31:30.585 --> 01:31:32.787
HOMELESSNESS. BY THE WAY, THEY

01:31:32.854 --> 01:31:35.523
DO NOT HAVE A SHELTER IN CORONA.

01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:38.092
TO END HOMELESSNESS, NOT SUPPORT

01:31:38.159 --> 01:31:41.028
PROGRAMS THAT PERPETUATE

01:31:41.095 --> 01:31:42.430
HOMELESSNESS, SUCH AS COMMUNITY

01:31:42.496 --> 01:31:44.665
BASED FAITH ORGANIZATIONS

01:31:44.732 --> 01:31:48.169
SERVING MEALS AND PARKS.

01:31:48.236 --> 01:31:51.772
COMMUNITY. FAITH BASED

01:31:51.839 --> 01:31:54.041
ORGANIZATIONS SERVING MEALS AND

01:31:54.108 --> 01:31:56.878
PARKS. SO HOW CRUEL DO WE HAVE

01:31:56.944 --> 01:32:00.548
TO BE TO SAY TO THE CATHOLIC

01:32:00.615 --> 01:32:03.351
CHURCH OR TO ANY FAITH BASED,

01:32:03.417 --> 01:32:06.420
SORRY, THIS IS ACTUALLY

01:32:06.487 --> 01:32:07.388
PERPETUATING HOMELESSNESS.

01:32:07.455 --> 01:32:09.490
PEOPLE ARE HOMELESSNESS, ARE

01:32:09.557 --> 01:32:10.725
HOMELESS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE

01:32:10.791 --> 01:32:13.194
A HOME. IT ISN'T BECAUSE THE

01:32:13.261 --> 01:32:14.195
MEALS THAT THEY'RE GETTING IN

01:32:14.262 --> 01:32:17.098
THE PARK. THEN IT GOES ON TO

01:32:17.164 --> 01:32:18.866
SAY, IN REVIEWING THE

01:32:18.933 --> 01:32:20.067
AMENDMENTS, WE STILL BELIEVE

01:32:20.134 --> 01:32:21.736
THAT THIS LEGISLATION WOULD

01:32:21.802 --> 01:32:23.437
IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE

01:32:23.504 --> 01:32:25.773
THE CITY'S MUNICIPAL CODE

01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:28.175
REGARDING UNAUTHORIZED MEAL

01:32:28.242 --> 01:32:30.344
SERVING IN THE PARKS, AND WOULD

01:32:30.411 --> 01:32:33.514
FURTHER ENCOURAGE, I CAN BARELY

01:32:33.581 --> 01:32:35.049
SPEAK, THE DISTRIBUTION OF

01:32:35.116 --> 01:32:38.986
BLANKETS AND SLEEPING BAGS THAT

01:32:39.053 --> 01:32:42.657
CONTRIBUTE TO ENCAMPMENTS. SO

01:32:42.723 --> 01:32:45.159
THIS MAKES ME THINK OF

01:32:45.226 --> 01:32:46.227
IMMIGRANTS, WHICH HAS BEEN SUCH

01:32:46.294 --> 01:32:48.496
A DISCUSSION AND HAS POLARIZED

01:32:48.562 --> 01:32:50.898
OUR COUNTRY AND PEOPLE CROSSING

01:32:50.965 --> 01:32:53.634
A BORDER, AND WHERE WE'VE HAD

01:32:53.701 --> 01:32:57.338
SOME LAWS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL

01:32:57.405 --> 01:32:59.840
TO SAY, IF WE GIVE YOU WATER,

01:32:59.907 --> 01:33:02.209
YOU WILL BE A CRIMINAL. SO NOW

01:33:02.276 --> 01:33:04.612
WE'RE TELLING PEOPLE, IF YOU

01:33:04.679 --> 01:33:07.348
GIVE A HOMELESS PERSON A BLANKET

01:33:07.415 --> 01:33:10.718
OR A SLEEPING BAG OR A MEAL, YOU

01:33:10.785 --> 01:33:15.723
WILL BE. YOU CAN BE

01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:18.893
CRIMINALIZED. AND YET WE'RE

01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:19.694
CRIMINALIZING PEOPLE FOR NOT

01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:23.631
HAVING A HOME. I'VE SEEN A LOT

01:33:23.698 --> 01:33:27.468
OF THINGS IN MY TIME HERE. THE

01:33:27.535 --> 01:33:29.303
OPPOSITION ACTUALLY PUTTING IN

01:33:29.370 --> 01:33:34.141
WRITING. IS JUST APPALLING. I

01:33:34.208 --> 01:33:37.278
JUST CAN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND THE

01:33:37.345 --> 01:33:38.346
THOUGHT PROCESS HERE. BUT I KNOW

01:33:38.412 --> 01:33:41.916
WHAT IT IS. WHAT IT IS, IS WE

01:33:41.983 --> 01:33:43.718
DON'T WANT THESE PEOPLE HERE. WE

01:33:43.784 --> 01:33:45.519
WANT TO DISAPPEAR PEOPLE. WE

01:33:45.586 --> 01:33:47.355
WANT TO DISAPPEAR, HOMELESS

01:33:47.421 --> 01:33:48.756
PEOPLE. WE WANT TO DISAPPEAR

01:33:48.823 --> 01:33:50.591
PEOPLE FROM GOING INTO SOBER

01:33:50.658 --> 01:33:51.993
LIVING HOMES. BECAUSE BY THE

01:33:52.059 --> 01:33:53.861
WAY, THAT'S ANOTHER BIG EFFORT.

01:33:53.928 --> 01:33:55.296
WE DON'T WANT SOBER LIVING HOMES

01:33:55.363 --> 01:33:57.732
IN OUR COMMUNITY. WE WANT TO

01:33:57.798 --> 01:34:00.234
DISAPPEAR IMMIGRANTS. WE WANT TO

01:34:00.301 --> 01:34:02.236
DISAPPEAR. ANYBODY THAT CAUSES

01:34:02.303 --> 01:34:05.740
US ANY CONCERN. AND THIS IS

01:34:05.806 --> 01:34:07.208
WHERE WE ARE IN THE UNITED

01:34:07.274 --> 01:34:10.011
STATES OF AMERICA. WE WILL JUST

01:34:10.077 --> 01:34:11.012
DISAPPEAR. YOU. WE DON'T CARE

01:34:11.078 --> 01:34:12.813
WHERE YOU GO, BUT YOU'RE NOT

01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:14.548
GOING TO BE IN OUR CITY. WE

01:34:14.615 --> 01:34:17.184
WON'T TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY.

01:34:17.251 --> 01:34:18.552
WE WON'T BUILD SHELTERS. WE'LL

01:34:18.619 --> 01:34:20.421
PUSH IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE. AND

01:34:20.488 --> 01:34:22.189
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON. AND THEN

01:34:22.256 --> 01:34:24.725
WHO SITS AT THE DAIS AND

01:34:24.792 --> 01:34:26.560
COMPLAINS? I WAS JUST IN A

01:34:26.627 --> 01:34:29.797
HEARING YESTERDAY WHERE ACTUALLY

01:34:29.864 --> 01:34:32.066
AN AUDIT WHERE IT WAS TALKING

01:34:32.133 --> 01:34:34.869
ABOUT SEXUAL OFFENDERS BEING

01:34:34.935 --> 01:34:36.137
RELEASED AND WHO WAS SCREAMING

01:34:36.203 --> 01:34:38.472
ABOUT IT. I'M SORRY, BUT OUR

01:34:38.539 --> 01:34:39.673
REPUBLICAN FRIENDS SAYING, WHY

01:34:39.740 --> 01:34:41.675
ARE THEY BEING RELEASED? AND

01:34:41.742 --> 01:34:43.210
THEY'RE BEING RELEASED INTO THE

01:34:43.277 --> 01:34:46.080
COMMUNITIES THEY CAME FROM, SO

01:34:46.147 --> 01:34:50.384
WE DON'T WANT THEM EITHER. SO

01:34:50.451 --> 01:34:52.153
IT'S ALMOST LIKE GOING BACK IN

01:34:52.219 --> 01:34:54.522
TIME WHERE WE USED TO HAVE WE'D

01:34:54.588 --> 01:34:56.824
SEND PEOPLE TO ISLANDS, YOU

01:34:56.891 --> 01:35:00.127
KNOW, THIS IS WHERE WE'RE AT. IF

01:35:00.194 --> 01:35:01.862
YOU HAD A DISEASE, YOU WOULD GO

01:35:01.929 --> 01:35:04.331
TO AN ISLAND. SO NOW WHAT ARE WE

01:35:04.398 --> 01:35:06.467
DOING? WE'RE SENDING PEOPLE TO

01:35:06.534 --> 01:35:08.903
ALLIGATOR. WHAT IS IT? ALCATRAZ,

01:35:08.969 --> 01:35:10.604
ALLIGATOR OR WHATEVER. WE'RE

01:35:10.671 --> 01:35:12.640
SENDING THEM TO EL SALVADOR. SO,

01:35:12.706 --> 01:35:13.874
YES, WHAT YOU MIGHT SAY. WHAT

01:35:13.941 --> 01:35:16.377
DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH ANY OF

01:35:16.444 --> 01:35:18.012
THAT? IT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO.

01:35:18.079 --> 01:35:21.248
IT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO. WHEN

01:35:21.315 --> 01:35:23.017
MUNICIPALITIES, WHEN COUNTIES

01:35:23.084 --> 01:35:25.286
THINK THEY CAN JUST DISAPPEAR

01:35:25.352 --> 01:35:28.055
PEOPLE AND THEN MAKE A CASE THAT

01:35:28.122 --> 01:35:30.257
THE PEOPLE TRYING TO HELP THEM

01:35:30.324 --> 01:35:33.427
ARE ACTUALLY THE CRIMINALS.

01:35:33.494 --> 01:35:35.029
THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK. I'M

01:35:35.096 --> 01:35:36.630
REALLY SADDENED TO SEE THE

01:35:36.697 --> 01:35:40.034
COUNTY I LIVE IN BEING LISTED AS

01:35:40.101 --> 01:35:42.103
OPPOSITION. I'M NOT ONLY

01:35:42.169 --> 01:35:43.938
SADDENED, BUT I'M DISGUSTED.

01:35:44.004 --> 01:35:48.008
THANK YOU. MR. CARR. THANK YOU,

01:35:48.075 --> 01:35:49.276
MR. CHAIR. THANK YOU, SENATOR,

01:35:49.343 --> 01:35:51.512
FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. AND I

01:35:51.579 --> 01:35:54.782
GOT TO SAY. I'VE ALWAYS LOVED

01:35:54.849 --> 01:35:56.584
QUIRK-SILVA. I THINK THE THIS

01:35:56.650 --> 01:35:58.018
FINAL TERM VERSION IS MY

01:35:58.085 --> 01:36:01.655
FAVORITE. AND, YOU KNOW, BUT

01:36:01.722 --> 01:36:03.090
SHE'S RIGHT. YOU KNOW, WE

01:36:03.157 --> 01:36:04.391
THERE'S SO MUCH MORE FOCUS ON

01:36:04.458 --> 01:36:05.693
PROPERTY VALUES THAN THE VALUE

01:36:05.759 --> 01:36:08.195
OF PEOPLE. WE ATTACH VALUE TO

01:36:08.262 --> 01:36:09.096
PEOPLE. WHAT CAN THEY BRING.

01:36:09.163 --> 01:36:10.731
WHAT CAN THEY DO. HOW MUCH MONEY

01:36:10.798 --> 01:36:12.099
DO THEY MAKE? OH, THEY'RE NOT

01:36:12.166 --> 01:36:13.601
DOING IT. THEY'RE THEY'RE

01:36:13.667 --> 01:36:15.002
HOMELESS. THEY'RE LET'S GET RID

01:36:15.069 --> 01:36:16.637
OF THEM. SWEEP THEM ASIDE. LET'S

01:36:16.704 --> 01:36:17.771
PRETEND THEY DON'T EXIST. AND

01:36:17.838 --> 01:36:18.873
IT'S SHAMEFUL. YOU KNOW, THE

01:36:18.939 --> 01:36:20.741
STATE UNIVERSITY, HUMAN RIGHTS

01:36:20.808 --> 01:36:21.809
INSTITUTE JUST CAME. EVERY YEAR

01:36:21.876 --> 01:36:23.777
THEY COME UP WITH THE PAIN INDEX

01:36:23.844 --> 01:36:25.579
IN SILICON VALLEY TO SHOW. AND

01:36:25.646 --> 01:36:27.081
EVERY YEAR IT GETS WORSE AND

01:36:27.148 --> 01:36:28.649
WORSE ON HOW MUCH FOLKS ARE

01:36:28.716 --> 01:36:31.552
STRUGGLING AND THE DISCREPANCY

01:36:31.619 --> 01:36:33.020
IN THE WEALTHIEST COUNTY, THE

01:36:33.087 --> 01:36:34.088
HIGHEST GDP, THE WEALTHIEST

01:36:34.155 --> 01:36:35.222
PLACE IN THE WEALTHIEST STATE,

01:36:35.289 --> 01:36:37.124
AND THE WEALTHIEST COUNTRY ON

01:36:37.191 --> 01:36:38.359
EARTH, WHERE YOU HAVE NINE

01:36:38.425 --> 01:36:39.727
HOUSEHOLDS THAT HAVE 15% OF THE

01:36:39.793 --> 01:36:43.097
WEALTH, NOT 9%. NINE HOUSEHOLDS

01:36:43.164 --> 01:36:44.798
HAVE 15% OF THE WEALTH. IN

01:36:44.865 --> 01:36:48.869
SILICON VALLEY, 0.1 PERCENT,

01:36:48.936 --> 01:36:50.804
0.1% HAVE 71% OF THE WEALTH. AND

01:36:50.871 --> 01:36:52.706
WE WONDER WHY PEOPLE ARE

01:36:52.773 --> 01:36:55.809
HOMELESS, AND THOSE SAME FOLKS

01:36:55.876 --> 01:36:56.911
WILL FIGHT TOOTH AND NAIL AND

01:36:56.977 --> 01:36:58.913
MAKE THE CONTRIBUTIONS THEY HAVE

01:36:58.979 --> 01:37:00.080
TO DO, POLITICAL AND OTHERWISE,

01:37:00.147 --> 01:37:01.015
TO MAKE SURE THEIR TAXES DON'T

01:37:01.081 --> 01:37:03.918
GO UP FIVE BUCKS SO THEY CAN BUY

01:37:03.984 --> 01:37:04.552
ANOTHER YACHT OR ANOTHER HOME.

01:37:04.618 --> 01:37:06.687
AND YET HERE WE HAVE

01:37:06.754 --> 01:37:07.788
MUNICIPALITIES LOOKING TO LOCK

01:37:07.855 --> 01:37:09.890
PEOPLE UP OR CITE THEM, OR IN

01:37:09.957 --> 01:37:13.327
ANY WAY BRAND THEM NEGATIVELY

01:37:13.394 --> 01:37:14.261
FOR TRYING TO HELP THEIR FELLOW

01:37:14.328 --> 01:37:16.463
HUMAN BEING. IT'S ABSOLUTELY

01:37:16.530 --> 01:37:17.965
SHAMEFUL. YOU KNOW, I DON'T TALK

01:37:18.032 --> 01:37:19.733
ABOUT IN SACRAMENTO, BUT BUT I

01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:21.268
THIS EVENT I DO IN SAN JOSE

01:37:21.335 --> 01:37:23.504
BECAUSE IT WASN'T IT'S NOT

01:37:23.571 --> 01:37:24.138
REALLY AN EVENT, BUT IT'S KIND

01:37:24.205 --> 01:37:25.973
OF BECOME ONE, I GUESS FOR 15

01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:27.975
YEARS I STARTED I STARTED IN MY

01:37:28.042 --> 01:37:28.909
HOUSE JUST ON ON BLACK FRIDAY. I

01:37:28.976 --> 01:37:31.579
CALL IT FRIDAY HOLIDAY WARM UP

01:37:31.645 --> 01:37:32.680
AND LITERALLY JUST STARTED WITH

01:37:32.746 --> 01:37:34.148
ME MAKING SANDWICHES AT LUNCH,

01:37:34.215 --> 01:37:36.217
BAGS AT HOME. AND A FEW FRIENDS

01:37:36.283 --> 01:37:38.185
CAME OVER AND DID IT, AND WE

01:37:38.252 --> 01:37:39.053
WOULD GO OUT TO THE COMMUNITY.

01:37:39.119 --> 01:37:40.788
AND IT'S KIND OF ONE OF THOSE

01:37:40.854 --> 01:37:42.723
THINGS WHERE THE CLICHE IS, YOU

01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:44.925
GET MORE OUT OF IT THAN THAN YOU

01:37:44.992 --> 01:37:46.493
GIVE. AND IT'S GROWN NOW FOR 15

01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:48.629
YEARS NOW WE DO IT AT A

01:37:48.696 --> 01:37:49.597
NONPROFIT CALLED COMMUNITY SAVE

01:37:49.663 --> 01:37:51.298
THAT FEEDS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

01:37:51.365 --> 01:37:52.099
OF MEALS EVERY YEAR THROUGHOUT

01:37:52.166 --> 01:37:53.234
THE BAY AREA, PARTICULARLY SANTA

01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:55.369
CLARA COUNTY AND ALAMEDA COUNTY.

01:37:55.436 --> 01:37:56.370
WE DO IT AT THEIR COMMERCIAL

01:37:56.437 --> 01:37:57.671
KITCHEN NOW, AND OVER THE YEARS,

01:37:57.738 --> 01:37:59.340
WE PROBABLY HAD HUNDREDS OF

01:37:59.406 --> 01:38:00.741
FOLKS COME WITH THEIR KIDS, COME

01:38:00.808 --> 01:38:01.942
WITH THEIR FAMILIES ON BLACK

01:38:02.009 --> 01:38:03.043
FRIDAY INSTEAD OF GOING TO THE

01:38:03.110 --> 01:38:04.678
MALL, THEY WANT TO COME AND

01:38:04.745 --> 01:38:06.380
BRING TOGETHER BLANKETS AND

01:38:06.447 --> 01:38:07.881
GLOVES. AND IT'S A BEAUTIFUL

01:38:07.948 --> 01:38:10.718
THING. AND THE MOST BEAUTIFUL

01:38:10.784 --> 01:38:12.086
THING ABOUT IT IS INTERACTIONS

01:38:12.152 --> 01:38:13.020
WE HAVE WITH OUR UNHOUSED

01:38:13.087 --> 01:38:15.789
BROTHERS AND SISTERS JUST

01:38:15.856 --> 01:38:16.924
SHOWING LOVE, SHOWING THAT

01:38:16.991 --> 01:38:17.891
THEY'RE CARED ABOUT, ESPECIALLY

01:38:17.958 --> 01:38:20.461
DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON. AND

01:38:20.527 --> 01:38:21.695
I'M THINKING ABOUT THAT NOW

01:38:21.762 --> 01:38:23.964
BECAUSE IT'S THE EXACT OPPOSITE

01:38:24.031 --> 01:38:25.366
OF WHAT SOME OTHER SOME OF THESE

01:38:25.432 --> 01:38:27.735
JURISDICTIONS ARE TRYING TO DO.

01:38:27.801 --> 01:38:30.271
AND SO YOUR THIS BILL IS ABOUT

01:38:30.337 --> 01:38:31.739
LOVE. IT'S ABOUT SHOWING THAT WE

01:38:31.805 --> 01:38:33.207
LOVE ONE ANOTHER, THAT WE'RE NOT

01:38:33.274 --> 01:38:34.708
GOING TO TELL ONE ANOTHER HOW

01:38:34.775 --> 01:38:36.944
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF ONE

01:38:37.011 --> 01:38:37.878
ANOTHER, THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:38:37.945 --> 01:38:39.513
ALLOW PEOPLE TO FEED ONE ANOTHER

01:38:39.580 --> 01:38:41.682
TO KEEP THEM WARM. I MEAN, THIS

01:38:41.749 --> 01:38:42.249
PEOPLE OF FAITH, YOU KNOW,

01:38:42.316 --> 01:38:43.617
THERE'S MANY PEOPLE THAT CLAIM

01:38:43.684 --> 01:38:45.019
TO BE OF FAITH THAT ARE PROBABLY

01:38:45.085 --> 01:38:46.887
ON THESE CITY COUNCILS AND BOARD

01:38:46.954 --> 01:38:48.355
OF SUPERVISORS THAT WILL GO TO

01:38:48.422 --> 01:38:49.790
THEIR CHURCH ON SUNDAY AND YET

01:38:49.857 --> 01:38:51.592
PASS SOMETHING LIKE THIS, WHICH

01:38:51.659 --> 01:38:52.459
IS ABSOLUTELY APPALLING. CORONA.

01:38:52.526 --> 01:38:54.194
THE AVERAGE RENT IS ABOUT $2,500

01:38:54.261 --> 01:38:55.729
A MONTH. THEY NEED TO DO

01:38:55.796 --> 01:38:56.697
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT AND NOT

01:38:56.764 --> 01:38:58.098
WORRY ABOUT SOMEONE'S GIVING

01:38:58.165 --> 01:38:59.533
SOMEONE A BOTTLE OF WATER. AND

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:01.602
SO I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED

01:39:01.669 --> 01:39:02.703
AT ANY, YOU KNOW, HIGHEST LEVEL

01:39:02.770 --> 01:39:04.538
OF AUTHORSHIP YOU ALLOW, BECAUSE

01:39:04.605 --> 01:39:06.674
I THINK THAT WE NEED TO MAKE A

01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:08.709
STATEMENT HERE THAT DURING THESE

01:39:08.776 --> 01:39:09.843
DIFFICULT CHALLENGES WE HAVE

01:39:09.910 --> 01:39:10.611
TRYING TO DEAL WITH

01:39:10.678 --> 01:39:11.879
HOMELESSNESS, THESE ARE VERY

01:39:11.945 --> 01:39:12.680
DIFFICULT ISSUES. WE'RE NOT

01:39:12.746 --> 01:39:14.014
GOING TO LOSE OUR EMPATHY. WE'RE

01:39:14.081 --> 01:39:16.183
NOT GOING TO LOSE OUR LOVE FOR

01:39:16.250 --> 01:39:18.452
ONE ANOTHER. THANK YOU, MR.

01:39:18.519 --> 01:39:23.123
PATTERSON. GREAT. THANK YOU.

01:39:23.190 --> 01:39:24.958
WELL, I WOULD I'D LIKE TO AGREE

01:39:25.025 --> 01:39:26.460
WITH THE CHARACTERIZATION FROM

01:39:26.527 --> 01:39:30.698
MY COLLEAGUE. MISS QUIRK-SILVA,

01:39:30.764 --> 01:39:33.367
ABOUT WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO

01:39:33.434 --> 01:39:34.001
AS SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATORS.

01:39:34.068 --> 01:39:35.736
IT IS TRUE. I DON'T WANT THEM

01:39:35.803 --> 01:39:37.604
RETURN TO MY COMMUNITY. AND I DO

01:39:37.671 --> 01:39:38.706
WANT THEM TO DISAPPEAR TO AN

01:39:38.772 --> 01:39:42.943
ISLAND. AND IT'S NOT ACCURATE TO

01:39:43.010 --> 01:39:45.979
SAY THAT THEY ARE ALWAYS FROM

01:39:46.046 --> 01:39:47.948
THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH THEY GO

01:39:48.015 --> 01:39:49.883
TO, DESPITE THE LAW SAYING THEY

01:39:49.950 --> 01:39:52.720
SHOULD BE. BUT THAT WAS A LITTLE

01:39:52.786 --> 01:39:54.722
BIT OF A BUT I STAND BY WHATEVER

01:39:54.788 --> 01:39:56.256
REPUBLICAN SAID THAT I STAND BY

01:39:56.323 --> 01:39:59.827
IT. BUT ON THIS BILL OF

01:39:59.893 --> 01:40:04.565
HOMELESSNESS. THERE'S A COUPLE

01:40:04.631 --> 01:40:08.569
ISSUES I HAVE WITH IT. FIRST OF

01:40:08.635 --> 01:40:11.772
ALL, I HAVE A PHILOSOPHICAL

01:40:11.839 --> 01:40:13.574
ISSUE. IF PEOPLE ARE OFFERED

01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:14.775
SERVICES AND REFUSE IT, I DON'T

01:40:14.842 --> 01:40:17.244
THINK THEY HAVE AN AUTOMATIC

01:40:17.311 --> 01:40:18.545
RIGHT FOR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:40:18.612 --> 01:40:22.483
TO BE UNABLE TO. COME UP WITH

01:40:22.549 --> 01:40:25.919
SOME OPTIONS. I DON'T THINK IF A

01:40:25.986 --> 01:40:28.021
LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFERS SHELTER

01:40:28.088 --> 01:40:29.823
TO PEOPLE, WHICH HAPPENS ON A

01:40:29.890 --> 01:40:31.358
REGULAR BASIS IN MY COMMUNITY,

01:40:31.425 --> 01:40:35.796
AND IT'S REJECTED THAT, THAT

01:40:35.863 --> 01:40:38.065
THEY OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO SLEEP

01:40:38.132 --> 01:40:39.933
WHEREVER THEY WANT ON THE

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:41.568
STREETS, ON THE RIGHT OF WAYS,

01:40:41.635 --> 01:40:43.070
ON OTHER PUBLIC PROPERTY, ON

01:40:43.137 --> 01:40:45.205
PRIVATE PROPERTY, WHEN THEY ARE

01:40:45.272 --> 01:40:49.676
OFFERED A PLACE TO RESIDE OR

01:40:49.743 --> 01:40:50.878
SLEEP. TEMPORARY EMERGENCY

01:40:50.944 --> 01:40:52.513
SHELTERS. MY COUNTY'S PUT A LOT

01:40:52.579 --> 01:40:54.214
OF COUNTIES HERE, PUT A LOT OF

01:40:54.281 --> 01:40:58.185
EFFORT INTO THAT PARTICULAR

01:40:58.252 --> 01:41:02.790
EFFORT, BUT THE ONE ISSUE I HAVE

01:41:02.856 --> 01:41:04.558
WITH THE BILL AND THE POLICY AND

01:41:04.625 --> 01:41:10.164
THE TEXT IS, IS. IS WHEN WE TALK

01:41:10.230 --> 01:41:14.067
ABOUT AT THE END OF THE BILL,

01:41:14.134 --> 01:41:15.402
SECTION TWO, WHERE IT TALKS

01:41:15.469 --> 01:41:19.072
ABOUT OTHER ACTIVITIES AND ITEMS

01:41:19.139 --> 01:41:20.441
NECESSARY FOR IMMEDIATE PERSONAL

01:41:20.507 --> 01:41:24.178
HEALTH AND HYGIENE. THOSE

01:41:24.244 --> 01:41:25.913
ACTIVITIES AREN'T WELL DEFINED

01:41:25.979 --> 01:41:29.850
IN THE STATUTE, AND THE STATE IS

01:41:29.917 --> 01:41:31.251
GIVING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN

01:41:31.318 --> 01:41:35.389
GRANTS FOR INTO MY COMMUNITY AND

01:41:35.456 --> 01:41:38.158
ACTUALLY LITIGATING ONE OF MY

01:41:38.225 --> 01:41:41.361
COUNTIES FOR TRYING TO STOP A

01:41:41.428 --> 01:41:42.963
NONPROFIT FROM, BY THE WAY,

01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:44.665
MAKING A TON OF MONEY OFF THE

01:41:44.731 --> 01:41:47.134
STATE TO DISTRIBUTE NEEDLES INTO

01:41:47.201 --> 01:41:48.702
MY COMMUNITY. AND IT COULD BE

01:41:48.769 --> 01:41:51.438
ARGUED THAT THAT IT AT LEAST BY

01:41:51.505 --> 01:41:53.040
SOME PEOPLE, THAT THAT'S

01:41:53.106 --> 01:41:56.210
NECESSARY FOR THAT, THAT'S

01:41:56.276 --> 01:41:59.780
NECESSARY FOR PERSONAL HEALTH.

01:41:59.847 --> 01:42:03.150
SO I WOULD SAY THAT'S WHERE I'M

01:42:03.217 --> 01:42:04.785
AT ON THIS BILL RIGHT NOW.

01:42:04.852 --> 01:42:06.019
THAT'S MY MAIN CONCERN WITH THIS

01:42:06.086 --> 01:42:08.422
BILL. BUT I UNDERSTAND WHAT

01:42:08.489 --> 01:42:10.924
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO. I THINK

01:42:10.991 --> 01:42:12.960
IT'S A LITTLE OVERLY TOO BROAD

01:42:13.026 --> 01:42:14.161
FOR ME TO SUPPORT IT TODAY. I

01:42:14.228 --> 01:42:15.796
DON'T THINK I KNOW YOU'RE COMING

01:42:15.863 --> 01:42:17.598
WITH THE RIGHT PLACE WITH THE

01:42:17.664 --> 01:42:19.666
BILL, SO I DON'T WANT MY

01:42:19.733 --> 01:42:21.001
CRITICISM TO, YOU KNOW, BE A

01:42:21.068 --> 01:42:21.802
REFLECTION OF WHAT I THINK

01:42:21.869 --> 01:42:26.039
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO. BUT I DO. I

01:42:26.106 --> 01:42:27.975
READ THE BILLS, AS I'M SURE YOU

01:42:28.041 --> 01:42:29.376
DO. YEAH. AND THAT'S MY CONCERN.

01:42:29.443 --> 01:42:31.011
AND IF YOU'D LIKE TO RESPOND TO

01:42:31.078 --> 01:42:33.380
MY TIRADE, PLEASE DO SO. BUT YOU

01:42:33.447 --> 01:42:34.248
DON'T HAVE TO. NO, ACTUALLY, I,

01:42:34.314 --> 01:42:37.518
I WOULD LOVE TO. SO FIRST AND

01:42:37.584 --> 01:42:40.053
FOREMOST, I'LL ADDRESS THE, THE

01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:41.054
CONCERN THAT YOU RAISED AROUND

01:42:41.121 --> 01:42:42.923
THE NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAM. SO

01:42:42.990 --> 01:42:45.125
NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS ARE

01:42:45.192 --> 01:42:47.995
ACTUALLY EXPLICITLY PROTECTED IN

01:42:48.061 --> 01:42:49.363
STATE LAW UNDER CALIFORNIA

01:42:49.429 --> 01:42:51.732
PUBLIC HEALTH CODE. SO THIS BILL

01:42:51.798 --> 01:42:53.700
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT. IN

01:42:53.767 --> 01:42:55.636
FACT, WE DON'T HAVE THE SAME

01:42:55.702 --> 01:42:57.704
PROTECTION FOR WATER, FOOD,

01:42:57.771 --> 01:42:59.573
OTHER TYPES OF SERVICES ANYWHERE

01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:01.174
IN CALIFORNIA CODE. SO THIS

01:43:01.241 --> 01:43:03.043
WOULD ACTUALLY BE ADDING IT. I

01:43:03.110 --> 01:43:04.244
BELIEVE THERE'S SEPARATE

01:43:04.311 --> 01:43:05.379
LEGISLATION RELATED TO THAT

01:43:05.445 --> 01:43:07.581
ISSUE THAT'S MOVING. I BELIEVE

01:43:07.648 --> 01:43:08.749
ACTUALLY ONE OF THE ASSEMBLY

01:43:08.815 --> 01:43:10.117
MEMBERS IS CARRYING A BILL

01:43:10.183 --> 01:43:11.351
RELATED TO THAT. I DON'T KNOW

01:43:11.418 --> 01:43:12.886
THE BILL NUMBER, BUT THAT IS

01:43:12.953 --> 01:43:14.621
PART OF THE REASON WHY I THINK

01:43:14.688 --> 01:43:17.224
YOU SAID IT WAS A CITY OR A

01:43:17.291 --> 01:43:17.724
COUNTY THAT'S CURRENTLY

01:43:17.791 --> 01:43:18.859
LITIGATING THAT THAT'S THAT IS

01:43:18.926 --> 01:43:21.862
AN EXPLICIT, AS THEY CALL THEM,

01:43:21.929 --> 01:43:23.931
SYRINGE EXCHANGE PROGRAM. SO

01:43:23.997 --> 01:43:26.466
THOSE ARE EXPLICITLY PROTECTED.

01:43:26.533 --> 01:43:28.936
THE FIRST ISSUE THAT THAT YOU

01:43:29.002 --> 01:43:34.408
HAD RAISED IN REGARDS TO, I'M

01:43:34.474 --> 01:43:35.909
FORGETTING, I THINK YOU HAD YOU

01:43:35.976 --> 01:43:40.247
WERE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT.

01:43:40.314 --> 01:43:44.117
SWEEPS AND ENCAMPMENTS AND, AND

01:43:44.184 --> 01:43:46.353
WHATNOT. YOU KNOW, THIS THIS

01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:47.754
ISN'T RELATED TO THAT. THIS IS

01:43:47.821 --> 01:43:50.290
RELATED SPECIFICALLY TO SERVICE

01:43:50.357 --> 01:43:53.060
PROVIDERS. AND SO THE BILL WAS

01:43:53.126 --> 01:43:54.194
INITIALLY MUCH BROADER, AND

01:43:54.261 --> 01:43:55.462
WE'VE NARROWED IT DOWN TO

01:43:55.529 --> 01:43:58.165
SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT ARE, YOU

01:43:58.231 --> 01:43:59.433
KNOW, PROVIDING THE SERVICES

01:43:59.499 --> 01:44:00.734
THAT YOU SEE DEFINED IN THE

01:44:00.801 --> 01:44:02.769
BILL, OF WHICH THAT DEFINITION

01:44:02.836 --> 01:44:04.338
WE WORKED ON WITH THE LEAGUE OF

01:44:04.404 --> 01:44:05.739
CITIES, WHO IS NEUTRAL ON THE

01:44:05.806 --> 01:44:07.240
BILL. SO HOPE THAT HELPS WITH

01:44:07.307 --> 01:44:08.609
WITH ANSWERING SOME OF THOSE

01:44:08.675 --> 01:44:13.313
CONCERNS. THANK YOU. MR. THANK

01:44:13.380 --> 01:44:15.148
YOU. AND, YOU KNOW, I JUST WANT

01:44:15.215 --> 01:44:17.250
TO ECHO THE SAME SENTIMENT FROM

01:44:17.317 --> 01:44:19.353
MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUE TO THAT,

01:44:19.419 --> 01:44:22.656
YOU KNOW, I'M REALLY PROUD OF A

01:44:22.723 --> 01:44:24.858
LOT OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO STOOD

01:44:24.925 --> 01:44:26.693
UP AGAINST SEXUAL PREDATORS IN

01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:27.928
OUR COMMUNITY AND BEING RELEASED

01:44:27.995 --> 01:44:29.596
IN OUR COMMUNITY. I DON'T THINK

01:44:29.663 --> 01:44:31.131
THAT'S SOMETHING TO BE ASHAMED

01:44:31.198 --> 01:44:33.767
ABOUT ONE BIT. AS SOMEBODY WHO

01:44:33.834 --> 01:44:35.869
HAS BEEN HOMELESS BEFORE, WHO

01:44:35.936 --> 01:44:38.839
HAS BOUNCED AROUND, WHO HAS HAD

01:44:38.905 --> 01:44:41.375
TO GO THROUGH A FAIRLY HARD

01:44:41.441 --> 01:44:42.843
LIFE, WHO'S GROWN UP THROUGH

01:44:42.909 --> 01:44:44.077
DRUGS, WHO'S GROWN UP ON LOW

01:44:44.144 --> 01:44:47.514
INCOME HOUSING, I THINK THAT

01:44:47.581 --> 01:44:50.384
THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY REALLY

01:44:50.450 --> 01:44:52.152
DANGEROUS FOR A LOT OF US HERE

01:44:52.219 --> 01:44:53.620
IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE. THIS

01:44:53.687 --> 01:44:55.789
REMOVES A LOT OF THE LOCAL

01:44:55.856 --> 01:44:57.591
CONTROL, AND IT PUTS IT ON EVERY

01:44:57.658 --> 01:44:59.026
SINGLE ONE OF US HERE IN THIS

01:44:59.092 --> 01:45:00.894
STATE BODY TO SOLVE HOMELESSNESS

01:45:00.961 --> 01:45:02.596
WHEN WE KNOW IT IS NOT WORKING.

01:45:02.663 --> 01:45:04.197
AND WHAT WE ARE CURRENTLY DOING

01:45:04.264 --> 01:45:07.000
TODAY IS NOT WORKING. THIS IS

01:45:07.067 --> 01:45:08.702
REMOVING SOME OF THE LOCAL

01:45:08.769 --> 01:45:10.303
CONTROL THAT THEY CAN HAVE TO

01:45:10.370 --> 01:45:12.439
SET UP FOR WHAT THEY CAN DO FOR

01:45:12.506 --> 01:45:13.407
THEIR COUNTY AND THEIR

01:45:13.473 --> 01:45:14.875
RESIDENTS. STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:45:14.941 --> 01:45:17.110
HAS ALMOST 40 MILLION PEOPLE,

01:45:17.177 --> 01:45:18.779
AND WE ARE TRYING TO CREATE A

01:45:18.845 --> 01:45:20.013
ONE SIZE FITS ALL FOR A STATE

01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:22.549
THAT HAS MORE THAN THE

01:45:22.616 --> 01:45:23.517
POPULATION OF CANADA, THAN

01:45:23.583 --> 01:45:27.888
AUSTRALIA. WE HAVE ALMOST

01:45:27.954 --> 01:45:29.723
190,000 PEOPLE. THE AMOUNT OF

01:45:29.790 --> 01:45:31.458
HOMELESS THAT WE HAVE IN THIS

01:45:31.525 --> 01:45:33.293
STATE IS A MAJOR METROPOLITAN

01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:34.728
CITY IN A MAJORITY OF THE STATES

01:45:34.795 --> 01:45:36.229
ACROSS THE BOARD, AND WE ARE

01:45:36.296 --> 01:45:38.231
TAKING AWAY LOCAL CONTROL. SO

01:45:38.298 --> 01:45:39.800
THAT WAY THEY CAN HELP THE

01:45:39.866 --> 01:45:41.568
RESIDENTS OF FRESNO, COUNTY OF

01:45:41.635 --> 01:45:43.270
ORANGE COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO

01:45:43.336 --> 01:45:44.871
COUNTY, AND ALL THESE OTHER

01:45:44.938 --> 01:45:46.173
COUNTIES THAT HAVE DIFFERENT

01:45:46.239 --> 01:45:47.641
PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN DIFFERENT

01:45:47.708 --> 01:45:49.076
WAYS AND DIFFERENT LIVES, AND

01:45:49.142 --> 01:45:51.578
CREATING A ONE STATE FITS ALL

01:45:51.645 --> 01:45:53.780
POLICY. AND WE ARE FAILING

01:45:53.847 --> 01:45:55.215
MONUMENTALLY BY THE MAJORITY

01:45:55.282 --> 01:45:56.983
PARTY IN THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY

01:45:57.050 --> 01:45:59.486
AND THE LEADERS IN THIS STATE.

01:45:59.553 --> 01:46:01.688
AND THIS IS ABOUT WE NEED TO

01:46:01.755 --> 01:46:04.091
RAISE STANDARDS AGAIN. WE HAVE

01:46:04.157 --> 01:46:05.225
TO THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO GET

01:46:05.292 --> 01:46:07.094
TO. WE HAVE LED WITH COMPASSION

01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:09.196
FOR THE LAST 20 TO 30 YEARS. AND

01:46:09.262 --> 01:46:10.831
THAT COMPASSION IS KILLING

01:46:10.897 --> 01:46:11.798
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE IT DOESN'T

01:46:11.865 --> 01:46:14.000
COME WITH STANDARDS. WHEN I WAS

01:46:14.067 --> 01:46:16.503
IN MY POSITION, I FOUGHT LIKE

01:46:16.570 --> 01:46:19.039
HELL, FOUGHT LIKE HELL TO PULL

01:46:19.106 --> 01:46:20.774
MY FAMILY OUT OF THE SITUATION

01:46:20.841 --> 01:46:21.908
THAT THEY WERE IN, TO PULL

01:46:21.975 --> 01:46:23.610
MYSELF OUT OF THE SITUATION I

01:46:23.677 --> 01:46:25.345
WAS IN. AND IT WAS BY RAISING

01:46:25.412 --> 01:46:27.647
STANDARDS AGAIN, NOT BY

01:46:27.714 --> 01:46:29.082
WEAPONIZED COMPASSION, SAYING

01:46:29.149 --> 01:46:31.251
THAT WE FEEL GOOD THAT THIS IS

01:46:31.318 --> 01:46:32.753
GOING TO WORK WHEN IT IS CLEARLY

01:46:32.819 --> 01:46:34.521
NOT WORKING. WE HAVE AN

01:46:34.588 --> 01:46:35.989
AFFORDABILITY CRISIS HERE IN

01:46:36.056 --> 01:46:37.057
CALIFORNIA THAT IS LEADING

01:46:37.124 --> 01:46:38.692
PEOPLE ON THE BRINK OF COLLAPSE.

01:46:38.759 --> 01:46:40.994
WHEN MY MOTHER MAKES $24,000 A

01:46:41.061 --> 01:46:43.764
YEAR RIGHT NOW, I UNDERSTAND

01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:44.865
WHOLEHEARTEDLY WHAT THE ISSUES

01:46:44.931 --> 01:46:46.433
ARE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND IT

01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:48.168
DOESN'T MEAN THAT I'M NOT

01:46:48.235 --> 01:46:49.035
COMPASSIONATE AND I DON'T CARE

01:46:49.102 --> 01:46:50.637
ABOUT THESE PEOPLE. IT MEANS IT

01:46:50.704 --> 01:46:52.906
IS TIME TO RAISE THE STANDARD

01:46:52.973 --> 01:46:54.941
HERE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE IT IS

01:46:55.008 --> 01:46:57.577
NOT WORKING. AND WHAT THIS BILL

01:46:57.644 --> 01:46:59.012
DOES, IT ACTUALLY TAKES AWAY

01:46:59.079 --> 01:47:00.814
THAT LOCAL CONTROL AND PUTS IT

01:47:00.881 --> 01:47:03.750
ON US, ALL OF US HERE IN THE

01:47:03.817 --> 01:47:05.285
CAPITOL SAYING THAT WE NEED TO

01:47:05.352 --> 01:47:07.120
SOLVE IT. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

01:47:07.187 --> 01:47:09.055
PREVENT THIS FROM GOING TO

01:47:09.122 --> 01:47:09.856
200,000 HOMELESS PEOPLE IN THE

01:47:09.923 --> 01:47:11.558
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ARE WE

01:47:11.625 --> 01:47:13.026
WILLING TO TAKE THAT UP? ARE WE

01:47:13.093 --> 01:47:15.529
WILLING TO MOVE THE AMOUNT OF

01:47:15.595 --> 01:47:16.997
AMOUNT OF LEGISLATION THAT IS

01:47:17.063 --> 01:47:19.065
MAKING IT SO HARD TO BUILD MORE

01:47:19.132 --> 01:47:21.701
HOUSING? WE DON'T HAVE A HOUSING

01:47:21.768 --> 01:47:23.136
AFFORDABILITY CRISIS. WE HAVE A

01:47:23.203 --> 01:47:24.171
HOUSING AVAILABILITY CRISIS

01:47:24.237 --> 01:47:25.906
BECAUSE OF THE RULES, LAWS AND

01:47:25.972 --> 01:47:27.307
LEGISLATION COMING OUT OF THIS

01:47:27.374 --> 01:47:29.342
BODY THAT IS MAKING IT SO HARD

01:47:29.409 --> 01:47:30.777
TO BUILD WHEN THE AVERAGE DOOR

01:47:30.844 --> 01:47:33.947
IS $900,000 FOR AN AFFORDABLE

01:47:34.014 --> 01:47:35.715
HOUSING, IT'S BETTER TO JUST BUY

01:47:35.782 --> 01:47:37.117
SOMEBODY A $900,000 HOUSE THAN

01:47:37.184 --> 01:47:39.619
BUILD 100 UNITS AT THAT PRICE,

01:47:39.686 --> 01:47:42.122
AND WE'RE NOT DOING THAT. AND SO

01:47:42.189 --> 01:47:44.124
NOW THIS IS TAKING IT AWAY AGAIN

01:47:44.191 --> 01:47:46.493
FROM THE LOCALS TRYING TO FIND

01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:48.328
SOLUTIONS TO HELP THEM OUT AND

01:47:48.395 --> 01:47:50.030
PUTS IT ON US. SO I'D ASK

01:47:50.096 --> 01:47:51.131
EVERYBODY HERE, AND I CHALLENGE

01:47:51.198 --> 01:47:51.998
EVERYBODY HERE IN THIS

01:47:52.065 --> 01:47:53.667
LEGISLATIVE BODY, IF THIS IS

01:47:53.733 --> 01:47:54.935
GOING TO PASS, THEN IT'S UP TO

01:47:55.001 --> 01:47:57.537
US TO SOLVE THAT HOMELESS ISSUE.

01:47:57.604 --> 01:47:58.171
AND WE CAN'T BLAME THE LOCALS.

01:47:58.238 --> 01:48:00.106
WE CAN'T BLAME ANYBODY ELSE BUT

01:48:00.173 --> 01:48:06.012
OURSELVES. OKAY, SO SENATOR,

01:48:06.079 --> 01:48:08.715
WELCOME TO CLOSE. YEAH. THANK

01:48:08.782 --> 01:48:11.685
YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER A COUPLE OF

01:48:11.751 --> 01:48:14.254
THINGS. I THINK FIRST, I WANT TO

01:48:14.321 --> 01:48:16.690
START OFF BY JUST THANKING THE

01:48:16.756 --> 01:48:17.791
ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. YOU KNOW, WHO

01:48:17.858 --> 01:48:19.526
WHO SPOKE AND OFFERED THEIR

01:48:19.593 --> 01:48:22.495
SUPPORT. AND, YOU KNOW,

01:48:22.562 --> 01:48:23.897
PARTICULARLY, YOU KNOW, ASSEMBLY

01:48:23.964 --> 01:48:27.567
MEMBER QUIRK-SILVA VERY POWERFUL

01:48:27.634 --> 01:48:30.704
COMMENTS. YOU KNOW, AROUND THE

01:48:30.770 --> 01:48:32.005
DIRECTION THAT WE'RE GOING IN

01:48:32.072 --> 01:48:35.408
TERMS OF THE DEMONIZATION OF THE

01:48:35.475 --> 01:48:37.244
IN HOUSE, NOT JUST THE IN HOUSE,

01:48:37.310 --> 01:48:40.146
BUT OF THOSE SERVICE PROVIDERS.

01:48:40.213 --> 01:48:42.115
IT I THINK, HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY

01:48:42.182 --> 01:48:43.750
SCARY AND INCREDIBLY CONCERNING

01:48:43.817 --> 01:48:45.151
TO WATCH THE DIRECTION THAT

01:48:45.218 --> 01:48:47.654
WE'RE GOING. AND ESPECIALLY AS

01:48:47.721 --> 01:48:49.489
SOMEONE THAT HAS EXPERIENCED

01:48:49.556 --> 01:48:50.490
HOMELESSNESS, IS SOMEBODY THAT

01:48:50.557 --> 01:48:52.325
HAS LOST SEVERAL FAMILY MEMBERS

01:48:52.392 --> 01:48:54.160
THAT LIVE OUT ON THE STREETS,

01:48:54.227 --> 01:48:56.630
THAT HAS RELIED ON THE AID AND

01:48:56.696 --> 01:48:58.865
THE KINDNESS OF SERVICE

01:48:58.932 --> 01:49:01.101
PROVIDERS. I UNDERSTAND THE

01:49:01.167 --> 01:49:02.068
IMPORTANCE OF THE WORK THAT

01:49:02.135 --> 01:49:05.272
THESE FOLKS DO. IT IS LIFE

01:49:05.338 --> 01:49:10.310
SAVING, AND I HAVE UNFORTUNATELY

01:49:10.377 --> 01:49:12.245
BEEN IN THE POSITION OF NOT

01:49:12.312 --> 01:49:15.415
BEING ABLE TO LOCATE MY LOVED

01:49:15.482 --> 01:49:18.218
ONE AND HAVING TO RELY ON

01:49:18.285 --> 01:49:20.020
SOMEBODY ELSE, BEING KIND ENOUGH

01:49:20.086 --> 01:49:21.988
TO PROVIDE THEM WATER, OR TO

01:49:22.055 --> 01:49:24.057
HELP THEM WITH LOCATING SHELTER

01:49:24.124 --> 01:49:25.625
SO THAT THEY SURVIVE AND THEY'RE

01:49:25.692 --> 01:49:29.429
OKAY. IT IS A TERRIBLE FEELING,

01:49:29.496 --> 01:49:32.532
BUT YOU REALIZE HOW POWERFUL IT

01:49:32.599 --> 01:49:34.834
IS. THE WORK THAT THESE

01:49:34.901 --> 01:49:36.403
ORGANIZATIONS DO AND WHETHER

01:49:36.469 --> 01:49:38.071
THEY ARE CHARITY ORGANIZATIONS,

01:49:38.138 --> 01:49:39.906
WHETHER THEY ARE FAITH BASED

01:49:39.973 --> 01:49:40.807
ORGANIZATIONS, WE HAVE A NUMBER

01:49:40.874 --> 01:49:42.409
OF FAITH BASED GROUPS THAT ARE

01:49:42.475 --> 01:49:44.210
SUPPORTING, YOU KNOW, THIS

01:49:44.277 --> 01:49:45.712
MEASURE BECAUSE IT IS THE RIGHT

01:49:45.779 --> 01:49:48.248
THING TO DO. AND THE FACT THAT

01:49:48.315 --> 01:49:52.852
WE HAVE EVEN HAD CITIES GO ABOUT

01:49:52.919 --> 01:49:53.920
CRIMINALIZING THESE

01:49:53.987 --> 01:49:55.722
ORGANIZATIONS, I THINK IS HIGHLY

01:49:55.789 --> 01:49:59.693
DISTURBING AND CONCERNING. THE

01:49:59.759 --> 01:50:02.595
ASSEMBLY MEMBER, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:50:02.662 --> 01:50:04.731
TALKED ABOUT THE WEAPONIZATION

01:50:04.798 --> 01:50:07.734
OF COMPASSION. AND, YOU KNOW,

01:50:07.801 --> 01:50:08.735
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT IS NOT WHAT

01:50:08.802 --> 01:50:11.638
I HAVE SEEN IN MY COMMUNITY, AND

01:50:11.705 --> 01:50:14.474
THAT IS NOT WHAT I HAVE SEEN.

01:50:14.541 --> 01:50:16.643
OVERALL, I'VE UNFORTUNATELY SEEN

01:50:16.710 --> 01:50:18.478
US MOVING IN THE WRONG

01:50:18.545 --> 01:50:19.879
DIRECTION. YOU KNOW, I MENTIONED

01:50:19.946 --> 01:50:22.716
THIS IN MY COMMENTS, BUT IN LOS

01:50:22.782 --> 01:50:24.584
ANGELES COUNTY AND, YOU KNOW,

01:50:24.651 --> 01:50:25.952
RESPECTFULLY, I WON'T NAME THE

01:50:26.019 --> 01:50:28.154
INDIVIDUAL. BUT WE HAD A MAYOR

01:50:28.221 --> 01:50:30.323
LITERALLY SUGGEST FROM THE DAIS

01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:32.325
DURING A PUBLIC COUNCIL MEETING

01:50:32.392 --> 01:50:34.260
THAT IN ORDER TO RESOLVE THE

01:50:34.327 --> 01:50:36.429
UNHOUSED CRISIS IN HIS

01:50:36.496 --> 01:50:38.565
COMMUNITY, THAT WE SHOULD GIVE

01:50:38.631 --> 01:50:40.033
OUT FREE FENTANYL TO THE

01:50:40.100 --> 01:50:41.835
UNHOUSED AND LET THE SITUATION

01:50:41.901 --> 01:50:43.937
RESOLVE ITSELF. THAT IS

01:50:44.004 --> 01:50:46.139
LITERALLY WISHING DEATH UPON

01:50:46.206 --> 01:50:50.810
PEOPLE. SO, YOU KNOW, I, I, I

01:50:50.877 --> 01:50:53.013
TRULY, TRULY AM JUST SO

01:50:53.079 --> 01:50:54.481
DISTURBED WHEN I HEAR COMMENTS

01:50:54.547 --> 01:50:56.950
LIKE THAT. AND, YOU KNOW,

01:50:57.017 --> 01:50:58.318
FRANKLY, I'VE I'VE BEEN REALLY

01:50:58.385 --> 01:50:59.986
PLEASED WITH THE WORK THAT WE'VE

01:51:00.053 --> 01:51:01.654
DONE WITH SEVERAL CITIES. WE'VE

01:51:01.721 --> 01:51:03.723
HAD DOZENS AND DOZENS OF CITIES

01:51:03.790 --> 01:51:05.392
REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION TO THIS

01:51:05.458 --> 01:51:07.527
BILL BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT

01:51:07.594 --> 01:51:08.828
WE'VE DONE WITH THEM, THE

01:51:08.895 --> 01:51:10.330
CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD,

01:51:10.397 --> 01:51:11.131
THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE TAKEN,

01:51:11.197 --> 01:51:12.799
VERY HAPPY THAT THE LEAGUE OF

01:51:12.866 --> 01:51:15.068
CITIES IS NEUTRAL. BUT THERE ARE

01:51:15.135 --> 01:51:16.836
A NUMBER OF CITIES AND, YOU

01:51:16.903 --> 01:51:18.238
KNOW, INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE

01:51:18.304 --> 01:51:20.140
SHARED WITH ME THAT THEY

01:51:20.206 --> 01:51:21.441
BELIEVED UNHOUSED SERVICE

01:51:21.508 --> 01:51:23.176
PROVIDERS ARE ACTUALLY

01:51:23.243 --> 01:51:25.311
PERPETUATING HOMELESSNESS. AND I

01:51:25.378 --> 01:51:27.714
JUST THINK THAT IS ENTIRELY

01:51:27.781 --> 01:51:30.083
FALSE TO SAY THAT SOMEBODY'S

01:51:30.150 --> 01:51:32.652
PROVIDING FOOD OR WATER TO

01:51:32.719 --> 01:51:34.120
SOMEONE THAT'S UNHOUSED AND

01:51:34.187 --> 01:51:36.122
LIVING OUT ON THE STREETS IS

01:51:36.189 --> 01:51:37.824
GOING TO ENCOURAGE THAT PERSON

01:51:37.891 --> 01:51:41.161
TO REMAIN HOMELESS IS UTTERLY

01:51:41.227 --> 01:51:43.396
RIDICULOUS AND ABSURD. AND AS

01:51:43.463 --> 01:51:45.832
SOMEBODY THAT HAS ACTUALLY

01:51:45.899 --> 01:51:47.734
EXPERIENCED HOMELESSNESS, WHO

01:51:47.801 --> 01:51:49.469
HAS WATCHED MY LOVED ONES

01:51:49.536 --> 01:51:51.304
LITERALLY DIE OUT ON THE

01:51:51.371 --> 01:51:52.972
STREETS, I WILL TELL YOU THAT

01:51:53.039 --> 01:51:55.542
THAT IS INHERENTLY FALSE. SO,

01:51:55.608 --> 01:51:59.245
YOU KNOW, WE IT IS MY OPINION

01:51:59.312 --> 01:52:01.047
THAT, YOU KNOW, THIS IS A VERY,

01:52:01.114 --> 01:52:03.583
VERY BASELINE AND VERY

01:52:03.650 --> 01:52:06.086
STRAIGHTFORWARD BILL.

01:52:06.152 --> 01:52:06.953
DEFINITELY, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING

01:52:07.020 --> 01:52:08.888
THAT I THINK OUR BODY NEEDS TO

01:52:08.955 --> 01:52:10.256
PASS TO RESPOND TO THIS GROWING

01:52:10.323 --> 01:52:12.659
TREND THAT WE'VE SEEN. YOU KNOW,

01:52:12.725 --> 01:52:15.695
I, I KNEW WHEN GRANTS PASS WAS

01:52:15.762 --> 01:52:17.664
DECIDED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL

01:52:17.730 --> 01:52:19.399
THAT IT WAS GOING TO HAVE

01:52:19.466 --> 01:52:20.834
IMPLICATIONS FOR LOCAL

01:52:20.900 --> 01:52:22.268
JURISDICTIONS, BUT IT HAS BEEN

01:52:22.335 --> 01:52:24.003
HIGHLY DISTURBING TO WATCH

01:52:24.070 --> 01:52:25.905
CITIES TRY TO WEAPONIZE IT IN

01:52:25.972 --> 01:52:28.074
THIS WAY. SO RESPECTFULLY ASK

01:52:28.141 --> 01:52:30.110
FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. AND THANK

01:52:30.176 --> 01:52:33.379
YOU. THANK YOU, SENATOR, FOR

01:52:33.446 --> 01:52:35.915
YOUR LEADERSHIP AND YOUR

01:52:35.982 --> 01:52:38.118
COMPASSION AND YOUR THOUGHTFUL

01:52:38.184 --> 01:52:39.619
APPROACH TO THIS BILL. AND I

01:52:39.686 --> 01:52:42.755
WANT TO THANK THE WITNESSES,

01:52:42.822 --> 01:52:44.824
ESPECIALLY FOR SHARING YOUR

01:52:44.891 --> 01:52:47.694
EXPERIENCE AND YOUR STORY AND

01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:50.697
HOW YOU WERE ABLE TO GET THROUGH

01:52:50.763 --> 01:52:51.931
HOMELESSNESS AND GET TO WHERE

01:52:51.998 --> 01:52:54.234
YOU ARE TODAY. I THINK THAT'S

01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:56.436
VERY INSTRUCTIVE FOR OUR

01:52:56.503 --> 01:52:59.038
CONVERSATION HERE. ALL OF US ARE

01:52:59.105 --> 01:53:01.074
HERE BECAUSE SOMEONE HELPED US,

01:53:01.141 --> 01:53:03.643
BECAUSE SOMEONE REACHED OUT A

01:53:03.710 --> 01:53:05.445
HAND AND LIFTED US UP. AND

01:53:05.512 --> 01:53:06.546
ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE

01:53:06.613 --> 01:53:07.981
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OR WHO

01:53:08.047 --> 01:53:11.117
ARE STRUGGLING OR WHO ARE IN A

01:53:11.184 --> 01:53:13.453
POSITION OF VULNERABILITY, WE

01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:16.122
ONLY GET TO A SAFER AND BETTER

01:53:16.189 --> 01:53:17.991
PLACE BECAUSE SOMEONE HAS

01:53:18.057 --> 01:53:20.059
SUPPORTED US AND HELPED US. AND

01:53:20.126 --> 01:53:21.661
THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY WHAT THIS

01:53:21.728 --> 01:53:24.164
IS ABOUT. YES, WE HAVE A

01:53:24.230 --> 01:53:25.565
HOMELESSNESS CRISIS AND A

01:53:25.632 --> 01:53:29.502
HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR STATE, BUT

01:53:29.569 --> 01:53:30.970
EVERYWHERE, AS LONG AS THERE'S

01:53:31.037 --> 01:53:32.739
BEEN HUMANITY, THERE HAVE BEEN

01:53:32.805 --> 01:53:34.274
PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN STRUGGLING,

01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:36.075
WHO NEEDED SOMEBODY TO CARE FOR

01:53:36.142 --> 01:53:38.711
THEM. SO THIS IS VERY MUCH, AS

01:53:38.778 --> 01:53:40.880
YOU SAID, THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL

01:53:40.947 --> 01:53:42.515
BASELINE THING THAT WE CAN DO,

01:53:42.582 --> 01:53:43.883
NOT ONLY AS CALIFORNIA BUT AS

01:53:43.950 --> 01:53:47.120
HUMAN BEINGS. WHEN SOMEBODY IS

01:53:47.187 --> 01:53:49.422
HUNGRY, WE GIVE THEM FOOD. WHEN

01:53:49.489 --> 01:53:51.891
SOMEBODY IS COLD, WE GIVE THEM A

01:53:51.958 --> 01:53:52.525
JACKET. WHEN SOMEBODY IS SICK,

01:53:52.592 --> 01:53:55.161
WE GIVE THEM MEDICINE THAT IS

01:53:55.228 --> 01:53:56.930
SHOULD NOT BE UP FOR DEBATE, AND

01:53:56.996 --> 01:54:00.466
IT CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT BE UP

01:54:00.533 --> 01:54:02.702
FOR CRIMINALIZATION OR SOME

01:54:02.769 --> 01:54:04.537
FOLKS IN OUR STATE WANTING TO

01:54:04.604 --> 01:54:05.972
BAN THAT FROM HAPPENING. YOU CAN

01:54:06.039 --> 01:54:07.040
READ ANY HISTORY BOOK. YOU CAN

01:54:07.106 --> 01:54:09.008
READ THE BIBLE. THIS IS ONE OF

01:54:09.075 --> 01:54:13.146
THE OLDEST AND MOST IMPORTANT

01:54:13.213 --> 01:54:14.881
PRACTICES OF HUMANITY TO BE

01:54:14.948 --> 01:54:17.183
THERE FOR SOMEONE WHO IS IN

01:54:17.250 --> 01:54:18.551
NEED, ESPECIALLY SOMEONE WHO IS

01:54:18.618 --> 01:54:21.054
WITHOUT A HOME. WE KNOW THAT.

01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:26.859
AND SO OUR OUR EFFORTS TO ENSURE

01:54:26.926 --> 01:54:28.628
THAT THOSE WHO HELP OTHERS ARE

01:54:28.695 --> 01:54:31.831
NOT CRIMINALIZED FOR IT IS

01:54:31.898 --> 01:54:33.600
ESSENTIAL FOR OUR OVERALL EFFORT

01:54:33.666 --> 01:54:34.834
TO RESPOND TO HOMELESSNESS. WE

01:54:34.901 --> 01:54:36.936
DON'T HAVE BORDERS OR WALLS ON

01:54:37.003 --> 01:54:39.305
OUR CITIES. SO IF A CITY IS

01:54:39.372 --> 01:54:40.907
GOING TO SAY THAT YOU CANNOT

01:54:40.974 --> 01:54:42.342
PROVIDE ANY SUPPORT TO PEOPLE

01:54:42.408 --> 01:54:44.277
HERE WHO ARE IN NEED, THAT DOES

01:54:44.344 --> 01:54:45.945
AFFECT ALL OF US AND IT AFFECTS

01:54:46.012 --> 01:54:47.380
US NEGATIVELY. IT AFFECTS THE

01:54:47.447 --> 01:54:48.281
SURROUNDING CITIES. IT AFFECTS

01:54:48.348 --> 01:54:50.550
OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND

01:54:50.617 --> 01:54:52.518
EFFECTIVELY TO THIS CRISIS. AND

01:54:52.585 --> 01:54:55.221
I WOULD ALSO APPRECIATE BEING

01:54:55.288 --> 01:54:57.023
ADDED AS A COAUTHOR. AND WE I

01:54:57.090 --> 01:54:59.292
KNOW, HAVE A MOTION FROM MISS

BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE

01:56:39.292 --> 01:56:41.994
AMENDMENTS AND THE VERY

01:56:42.061 --> 01:56:43.796
THOUGHTFUL WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE

01:56:43.863 --> 01:56:45.331
BY THE COMMITTEE STAFF IN THE

01:56:45.398 --> 01:56:46.699

THOSE AMENDMENTS, AND THIS BILL

01:56:50.403 --> 01:56:53.906
IS INTENDED TO CONTINUE THE

01:56:53.973 --> 01:56:55.408
PERFECTION, THE EVOLUTION OF ONE

01:56:55.475 --> 01:56:56.442
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT

01:56:56.509 --> 01:56:57.810
INITIATIVES THAT CALIFORNIA HAS

01:56:57.877 --> 01:56:59.512
HAD IN PROMOTING INFILL

01:56:59.579 --> 01:57:00.780
DEVELOPMENT. IT'S THE INFILL

01:57:00.847 --> 01:57:02.315
INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM.

01:57:02.382 --> 01:57:04.150
THIS IS NOW AN ALMOST TWO DECADE

01:57:04.217 --> 01:57:07.153
OLD PROGRAM THAT HAS PROVIDED

01:57:07.220 --> 01:57:08.955
FUNDING FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:57:09.021 --> 01:57:10.456
IN AREAS TO SUPPORT THE

01:57:10.523 --> 01:57:12.725
DEVELOPMENT OF MIXED USE, INFILL

01:57:12.792 --> 01:57:14.727
HOUSING AND COMMERCIAL

01:57:14.794 --> 01:57:16.295
ACTIVITIES, AND IT IS INTENDED

01:57:16.362 --> 01:57:17.663
TO DO SO IN ORDER TO BRING THE

01:57:17.730 --> 01:57:19.031
DRIVE. THE BOTH ADVANCE THE

01:57:19.098 --> 01:57:20.400
DEVELOPMENT OF THOSE AREAS, BUT

01:57:20.466 --> 01:57:22.034
ALSO TO DRIVE DOWN THE

01:57:22.101 --> 01:57:23.669
INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS SO THAT NEW

01:57:23.736 --> 01:57:25.204
PROJECTS, AFFORDABLE HOUSING,

01:57:25.271 --> 01:57:27.106
MARKET HOUSING, COMMERCIAL

01:57:27.173 --> 01:57:28.107
PROJECTS DON'T THEMSELVES HAVE

01:57:28.174 --> 01:57:29.642
TO BEAR ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT,

01:57:29.709 --> 01:57:31.811
IMPACT FEE AND DEVELOPMENT

01:57:31.878 --> 01:57:32.912
AGREEMENT EXPENSES. AND TO MAKE

01:57:32.979 --> 01:57:34.747
THAT THAT THAT ECONOMICALLY

01:57:34.814 --> 01:57:36.716
VIABLE. I KNOW IF YOU DON'T LIVE

01:57:36.783 --> 01:57:38.584
IN AN INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT AREA

01:57:38.651 --> 01:57:41.320
AS I DO, I KNOW YOU AND DOES AT

01:57:41.387 --> 01:57:43.156
LEAST DURING SESSION, MR.

01:57:43.222 --> 01:57:46.259
TAGUBA. BUT I KNOW YOU'VE SEEN

01:57:46.325 --> 01:57:47.960
IT BECAUSE IN MY OWN CITY OF

01:57:48.027 --> 01:57:48.861
WEST SACRAMENTO, RIGHT ACROSS

01:57:48.928 --> 01:57:49.896
THE RIVER, WHETHER YOU'VE BEEN

01:57:49.962 --> 01:57:51.831
OVER ACROSS THE RIVER, YOU'VE

01:57:51.898 --> 01:57:53.199
BEEN ON HIGHWAY 50, AND YOU LOOK

01:57:53.266 --> 01:57:55.034
DOWN, YOU CAN SEE ONE OF THE

01:57:55.101 --> 01:57:56.469
REGION'S BIGGEST SUCCESS

01:57:56.536 --> 01:57:58.304
STORIES. AND THAT IS THAT WAS

01:57:58.371 --> 01:57:59.872
LARGELY THE RESULT OF

01:57:59.939 --> 01:58:01.474
INVESTMENTS FROM THE INFILL

01:58:01.541 --> 01:58:02.675
INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM. SO

01:58:02.742 --> 01:58:03.843
THIS BILL SIMPLY TRIES TO

01:58:03.910 --> 01:58:05.144
CONTINUE THAT THE EVOLUTION OF A

01:58:05.211 --> 01:58:08.080
OF A PROVEN PROGRAM BY INCLUDING

01:58:08.147 --> 01:58:09.949
ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS ABOUT HOW

01:58:10.016 --> 01:58:12.685
WE PROMOTE AND MEASURE AND

01:58:12.752 --> 01:58:15.621
SECURE THE PROPER COMMITMENTS

01:58:15.688 --> 01:58:16.689
FOR WALKING AND PEDESTRIAN

01:58:16.756 --> 01:58:17.824
INFRASTRUCTURE, IN ADDITION TO

01:58:17.890 --> 01:58:19.992
THE TRANSIT AND ROAD

01:58:20.059 --> 01:58:20.927
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ARE ALREADY

01:58:20.993 --> 01:58:23.162
COVERED BY THE BILL, IT ALSO

01:58:23.229 --> 01:58:24.797
STARTS TO LOOK AT THE DISTRICT

01:58:24.864 --> 01:58:26.699
AS A DISTRICT. AND THIS, I

01:58:26.766 --> 01:58:27.934
THINK, IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:29.836
THOSE OF US THAT HAVE DONE WORK

01:58:29.902 --> 01:58:31.838
LOCALLY. AND I KNOW THE CHAIR IN

01:58:31.904 --> 01:58:33.639
HIS WORK ON DOWNTOWN'S THAT IT

01:58:33.706 --> 01:58:35.074
IS SOMETIMES IT CAN BE VERY

01:58:35.141 --> 01:58:35.942
TEMPTING TO SAY, YOU KNOW, THE

01:58:36.008 --> 01:58:37.777
WHOLE ISSUE IS THAT THAT ONE

01:58:37.844 --> 01:58:39.712
PARCEL WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:58:39.779 --> 01:58:42.849
WE BUILD HOUSING THERE AND, AND

01:58:42.915 --> 01:58:45.184
BUT HERE'S THE CHALLENGE IS THAT

01:58:45.251 --> 01:58:47.453
YOU ALSO NEED A LAUNDROMAT. IT'D

01:58:47.520 --> 01:58:48.821
BE GOOD IF THERE WAS SOMEWHERE

01:58:48.888 --> 01:58:51.190
TO EAT NEARBY OR GET A CUP OF

01:58:51.257 --> 01:58:52.058
COFFEE IF YOU COULD ACTUALLY

01:58:52.124 --> 01:58:55.228
WORK NEARBY. AND SO ONCE, ONCE

01:58:55.294 --> 01:58:57.330
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT, THE RIGHT

01:58:57.396 --> 01:58:58.965
POLICIES AROUND AFFORDABILITY

01:58:59.031 --> 01:59:00.666
AND ACCESS, IT REALLY IS

01:59:00.733 --> 01:59:02.735
IMPORTANT THAT YOU THEN KIND OF

01:59:02.802 --> 01:59:04.070
WRECKS YOUR OBSESSION WITH A

01:59:04.136 --> 01:59:05.671
PARTIAL BY PARTIAL APPROACH THAT

01:59:05.738 --> 01:59:07.006
REALLY CREATING AN ORGANIC,

01:59:07.073 --> 01:59:09.208
SUCCESSFUL INFILL AREA MEANS

01:59:09.275 --> 01:59:10.776
PROMOTING A WIDE VARIETY OF USES

01:59:10.843 --> 01:59:12.778
THAT THEMSELVES SUPPORT THE

01:59:12.845 --> 01:59:14.347
ROOF, BUT THEN ALSO THE LIFE

01:59:14.413 --> 01:59:15.681
THAT WILL TAKE PLACE UNDER THE

01:59:15.748 --> 01:59:17.216
ROOF. AND SO THIS BILL IS

01:59:17.283 --> 01:59:18.150
INTENDED TO CONTINUE THAT

01:59:18.217 --> 01:59:19.652
PROCESS. ANOTHER ELEMENT THAT

01:59:19.719 --> 01:59:20.720
WE'RE TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH IS

01:59:20.786 --> 01:59:22.522
ALSO TO LOOK AT CLUSTERS OF

01:59:22.588 --> 01:59:24.056
PARCELS OR ADJACENT PARCELS. I

01:59:24.123 --> 01:59:25.358
KNOW IF I'VE EXPERIENCED THIS IN

01:59:25.424 --> 01:59:27.260
THE CITY WHERE WE HAVE, WE'LL

01:59:27.326 --> 01:59:28.528
HAVE AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS

01:59:28.594 --> 01:59:30.029
ON THREE DIFFERENT PARCELS FROM

01:59:30.096 --> 01:59:32.598
PROGRAMS LIKE THIS THAT MIGHT

01:59:32.665 --> 01:59:33.866
SAY THEY'RE ALL 30% AFFORDABLE,

01:59:33.933 --> 01:59:36.168
AND EACH ONE OF THEM IS JUST SAY

01:59:36.235 --> 01:59:37.103
THEY'RE EACH 1000 UNITS. SO EACH

01:59:37.169 --> 01:59:38.771
ONE IS PROJECTED THAT WE HAVE TO

01:59:38.838 --> 01:59:41.541
DO 300 PER PER PARCEL. SOMETIMES

01:59:41.607 --> 01:59:43.409
THE FINANCING AND THE MARKET AND

01:59:43.476 --> 01:59:44.977
JUST LUCK AND LIGHTNING STRIKES,

01:59:45.044 --> 01:59:46.879
AND YOU CAN BUILD A THOUSAND ON

01:59:46.946 --> 01:59:48.748
THE FIRST PARCEL. BUT YOU HAVE

01:59:48.814 --> 01:59:50.750
TO DO THAT. YOU NEED YOU NEED

01:59:50.816 --> 01:59:53.119
SOME SOME IN LIEU FEES FROM THE

01:59:53.185 --> 01:59:54.020
SECOND PARCEL. SO YOU'RE BETTER

01:59:54.086 --> 01:59:56.022
OFF BUILDING A 100% AFFORDABLE

01:59:56.088 --> 01:59:57.657
ON THAT FIRST PARCEL. GET 1000

01:59:57.723 --> 01:59:59.325
UNITS THAN YOU ARE IN, REQUIRING

01:59:59.392 --> 02:00:02.094
EACH PARCEL TO PRODUCE 300. BUT

02:00:02.161 --> 02:00:03.462
A LOT OF OUR CURRENT POLICIES

02:00:03.529 --> 02:00:04.664
DON'T ALLOW THAT. THEY'RE JUST

02:00:04.730 --> 02:00:06.098
SO PARTIAL OBSESSED THAT THEY

02:00:06.165 --> 02:00:08.234
DON'T ALLOW YOU TO LOOK AT A

02:00:08.301 --> 02:00:10.436
MICRO DISTRICT. AND SO THAT'S

02:00:10.503 --> 02:00:11.137
ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE'RE

02:00:11.203 --> 02:00:12.872
TRYING TO MOVE THE INFILL

02:00:12.939 --> 02:00:13.806
INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM TO

02:00:13.873 --> 02:00:15.841
BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE AND

02:00:15.908 --> 02:00:17.009
NOT JUST THE PARCEL ALONE.

02:00:17.076 --> 02:00:18.911
OTHERWISE, IT'S A VERY MODEST

02:00:18.978 --> 02:00:20.446
BILL IN TERMS OF CONTINUING TO

02:00:20.513 --> 02:00:21.914
ENHANCE THE INFRASTRUCTURE

02:00:21.981 --> 02:00:23.916
PROGRAM. AND I'D ASK FOR AN AYE

02:00:23.983 --> 02:00:26.719
VOTE WITH ME. IS MELISSA BREACH

02:00:26.786 --> 02:00:27.353
FROM PROSPERITY CALIFORNIA, THE

02:00:27.420 --> 02:00:32.258
SPONSOR OF THE BILL? GOOD

02:00:32.325 --> 02:00:33.392
MORNING, MISTER CHAIR. COMMITTEE

02:00:33.459 --> 02:00:34.827
MEMBERS, THANK YOU FOR THE

02:00:34.894 --> 02:00:36.362
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU

02:00:36.429 --> 02:00:37.330
TODAY. I'M MELISSA BREACH, CEO

02:00:37.396 --> 02:00:38.497
OF PROSPERITY CALIFORNIA,

02:00:38.564 --> 02:00:40.533
SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF 772.

02:00:40.600 --> 02:00:41.701
WE'RE A FISCALLY SPONSORED

02:00:41.767 --> 02:00:43.035
PROJECT OF WINDWARD FUND, WHERE

02:00:43.102 --> 02:00:44.704
WE WORK TO BUILD MORE HOMES IN

02:00:44.770 --> 02:00:46.572
OUR EXISTING COMMUNITIES,

02:00:46.639 --> 02:00:47.173
MITIGATE CLIMATE IMPACTS, AND

02:00:47.239 --> 02:00:48.941
LOWER CALIFORNIANS COST OF

02:00:49.008 --> 02:00:51.243
LIVING. WE NEED TO PLAN FOR 2.5

02:00:51.310 --> 02:00:52.912
MILLION MORE HOMES BY 2030 TO

02:00:52.979 --> 02:00:54.213
EVEN BEGIN ADDRESSING OUR

02:00:54.280 --> 02:00:55.381
HOUSING SHORTAGE AND

02:00:55.448 --> 02:00:58.017
AFFORDABILITY CRISIS. BUT AT

02:00:58.084 --> 02:00:59.251
120,000 NEW UNITS PER YEAR,

02:00:59.318 --> 02:01:01.821
WE'RE NOT ON TARGET TO MEET THE

02:01:01.887 --> 02:01:03.756
AMBITIOUS HOUSING AND CLIMATE

02:01:03.823 --> 02:01:05.491
GOALS THE LEGISLATURE HAS SET.

02:01:05.558 --> 02:01:06.959
OUR INFRASTRUCTURE CAN'T HANDLE

02:01:07.026 --> 02:01:07.960
THE DEMAND FOR THE AMOUNT OF

02:01:08.027 --> 02:01:10.096
HOUSING WE NEED TO BUILD. IN

02:01:10.162 --> 02:01:11.731
2019, THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF

02:01:11.797 --> 02:01:13.566
CIVIL ENGINEERS GAVE CALIFORNIA

02:01:13.633 --> 02:01:16.235
A C MINUS ON INFRASTRUCTURE,

02:01:16.302 --> 02:01:18.270
FINDING SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES

02:01:18.337 --> 02:01:20.172
IN BOTH CONDITIONS AND

02:01:20.239 --> 02:01:21.774
FUNCTIONALITY, AS WELL AS AN

02:01:21.841 --> 02:01:23.542
INCREASING VULNERABILITY TO

02:01:23.609 --> 02:01:25.444
RISK. TODAY, TOO MANY INFILL

02:01:25.511 --> 02:01:27.279
SITES SIT EMPTY AND UNDEVELOPED

02:01:27.346 --> 02:01:28.514
BECAUSE THE NEEDED

02:01:28.581 --> 02:01:29.982
INFRASTRUCTURE IS PROHIBITIVELY

02:01:30.049 --> 02:01:31.884
EXPENSIVE. BUT WE'RE FORTUNATE

02:01:31.951 --> 02:01:32.752
TO HAVE THE INFILL

02:01:32.818 --> 02:01:34.353
INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM, AN

02:01:34.420 --> 02:01:35.755
EFFECTIVE YET OVERSUBSCRIBED

02:01:35.821 --> 02:01:38.991
PROGRAM THAT FUNDS AFFORDABLE

02:01:39.058 --> 02:01:41.093
HOUSING AND MIXED INCOME

02:01:41.160 --> 02:01:43.429
HOUSING. WE'RE PROUD TO SPONSOR

02:01:43.496 --> 02:01:45.464
THE SENATOR INVESTING IN CLIMATE

02:01:45.531 --> 02:01:46.999
RESILIENT AND AFFORDABLE

02:01:47.066 --> 02:01:48.701
COMMUNITIES ACT, WHICH MAKES

02:01:48.768 --> 02:01:49.802
VALUABLE AND TARGETED

02:01:49.869 --> 02:01:51.971
IMPROVEMENTS TO IAG.

02:01:52.038 --> 02:01:53.439
SPECIFICALLY, IT MAKES

02:01:53.506 --> 02:01:54.740
WALKABILITY MATTER. CURRENTLY,

02:01:54.807 --> 02:01:57.076
IAG PRIORITIZES INFRASTRUCTURE

02:01:57.143 --> 02:01:58.110
FOR PROJECTS NEAR EXISTING HIGH

02:01:58.177 --> 02:02:01.080
FREQUENCY TRANSIT STOPS. 77 TWO

02:02:01.147 --> 02:02:03.516
WILL ADD IN WHERE TRANSIT IS

02:02:03.582 --> 02:02:05.518
ALREADY PLANNED FOR, AS WELL AS

02:02:05.584 --> 02:02:06.719
INCLUDE PROJECTS IN HIGH

02:02:06.786 --> 02:02:07.787
RESOURCE, WALKABLE

02:02:07.853 --> 02:02:08.788
NEIGHBORHOODS. THAT'S A BIG WIN

02:02:08.854 --> 02:02:10.656
FOR BOTH HOUSING AND WORKING

02:02:10.723 --> 02:02:12.191
FAMILIES. IT WILL ALSO MAKE

02:02:12.258 --> 02:02:13.559
PROJECTS MORE FEASIBLE AND

02:02:13.626 --> 02:02:15.428
RESILIENT TO CLIMATE DISASTERS.

02:02:15.494 --> 02:02:16.862
TODAY, MANY, IF NOT MOST,

02:02:16.929 --> 02:02:17.997
CALIFORNIANS ARE AT RISK AT

02:02:18.064 --> 02:02:20.633
CLIMATE DRIVEN FIRES AND FLOODS.

02:02:20.700 --> 02:02:23.135

SOME OF THESE CHANGES ARE

02:04:07.506 --> 02:04:08.107
NECESSARY, ESPECIALLY IN SOME OF

02:04:08.174 --> 02:04:09.775
THE INFO HOUSES. NOT ONLY THAT,

02:04:09.842 --> 02:04:12.645
I THINK A LOT OF IT HELPS

02:04:12.711 --> 02:04:14.046
DOWNSTREAM MAKE IT FISCALLY

02:04:14.113 --> 02:04:16.348

WE'RE TRYING TO DO WHAT WE CAN

02:04:19.251 --> 02:04:20.753
ON THE AFFORDABILITY SIDE, BUT

02:04:20.820 --> 02:04:22.588
ALSO MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN

02:04:22.655 --> 02:04:23.856

GOOD MORNING. MORNING. I WANT TO

THANK THE CHAIR AND THE STAFF

02:23:57.695 --> 02:24:00.064
FOR ALL YOUR SUPPORT AND

02:24:00.131 --> 02:24:01.332
DELIBERATION ON THIS BILL. I

02:24:01.399 --> 02:24:02.600
WILL BE ACCEPTING THE

02:24:02.667 --> 02:24:04.168
COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDED

02:24:04.235 --> 02:24:06.270
AMENDMENT LATER TODAY IN THE

02:24:06.337 --> 02:24:09.540
ASSEMBLY. LOCAL GOVT COMMITTEE.

02:24:09.607 --> 02:24:11.309
THIS BILL IS ABOUT KEEPING OUR

02:24:11.376 --> 02:24:12.710
STRONGEST HOUSING LAW, THE

02:24:12.777 --> 02:24:14.545
HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT,

02:24:14.612 --> 02:24:16.781
FOCUSED ON WHAT IT WAS DESIGNED

02:24:16.848 --> 02:24:20.685
TO DO BUILD HOMES. THE HA WAS

02:24:20.752 --> 02:24:22.487
CREATED TO ACCELERATE HOUSING

02:24:22.553 --> 02:24:23.755
PRODUCTION, NOT TO STREAMLINE

02:24:23.821 --> 02:24:26.057
THE DEVELOPMENT OF HOTELS AND

02:24:26.124 --> 02:24:27.558
RESORTS. BUT LATELY WE'VE SEEN

02:24:27.625 --> 02:24:29.427
DEVELOPERS USING HOUSING LAWS TO

02:24:29.494 --> 02:24:31.896
FAST TRACK HOTEL PROJECTS, EVEN

02:24:31.963 --> 02:24:33.364
IN AREAS WHERE HOTELS WOULD

02:24:33.431 --> 02:24:35.166
NORMALLY BE BLOCKED BY LOCAL

02:24:35.233 --> 02:24:36.667
ZONING. SOME HOTEL COMPONENTS

02:24:36.734 --> 02:24:39.037
HAVE EVEN BEEN ADDED LATE, IN

02:24:39.103 --> 02:24:40.271
THE PROCESS, CUTTING DOWN THE

02:24:40.338 --> 02:24:42.273
NUMBER OF HOMES ORIGINALLY

02:24:42.340 --> 02:24:44.075
PROPOSED. WE'VE SEEN THIS HAPPEN

02:24:44.142 --> 02:24:45.810
IN BEVERLY HILLS AND SANTA

02:24:45.877 --> 02:24:47.779
MONICA. WE'VE ALSO SEEN HOTEL

02:24:47.845 --> 02:24:49.881
PROPOSALS PUSHED FORWARD IN FIRE

02:24:49.947 --> 02:24:51.749
PRONE AREAS WHERE ZONING

02:24:51.816 --> 02:24:53.418
WOULDN'T NORMALLY ALLOW THEM,

02:24:53.484 --> 02:24:54.786
LIKE THE SONOMA DEVELOPMENT

02:24:54.852 --> 02:24:56.320
CENTER AND THE MOUNTAIN WINERY

02:24:56.387 --> 02:24:58.056
IN SARATOGA. WE'VE SEEN

02:24:58.122 --> 02:24:59.657
DEVELOPERS SUBMIT THE SAME

02:24:59.724 --> 02:25:01.426
PROJECT IN MULTIPLE VERSIONS,

02:25:01.492 --> 02:25:03.828
SOME WITH HOTELS, SOME WITHOUT,

02:25:03.895 --> 02:25:06.030
AND SACRAMENTO. ONE VERSION

02:25:06.097 --> 02:25:08.166
INCLUDED A 300 ROOM HOTEL AND

02:25:08.232 --> 02:25:11.135
NEARLY 100 FEWER HOMES. THE

02:25:11.202 --> 02:25:12.503
OTHER VERSION DROPPED THE HOTEL

02:25:12.570 --> 02:25:15.673
AND ADDED 696 MORE HOMES. THAT

02:25:15.740 --> 02:25:17.241
TELLS US THE PROJECT DOESN'T

02:25:17.308 --> 02:25:18.943
RELY ON THE HOTEL TO MOVE

02:25:19.010 --> 02:25:20.578
FORWARD WHEN HOUSING.

02:25:20.645 --> 02:25:21.946
STREAMLINING LAWS ARE USED TO

02:25:22.013 --> 02:25:23.948
BUILD HOMES, HOTELS, NOT HOMES.

02:25:24.015 --> 02:25:26.217
A FEW THINGS HAPPEN. WE LOSE

02:25:26.284 --> 02:25:26.984
LIMITED LAND THAT COULD HAVE

02:25:27.051 --> 02:25:28.753
GONE TO PERMANENT HOUSING. WE

02:25:28.820 --> 02:25:30.221
PUSH LOW WAGE WORKERS FARTHER

02:25:30.288 --> 02:25:31.889
FROM WHERE THEY WORK. WE SHIFT

02:25:31.956 --> 02:25:33.991
THE FOCUS OF THE HA AWAY FROM

02:25:34.058 --> 02:25:36.294
HOUSING, AND WE RISK WEAKENING

02:25:36.360 --> 02:25:37.662
PUBLIC TRUST IN THE HOUSING

02:25:37.728 --> 02:25:39.497
LAWS. THIS LEGISLATURE HAS

02:25:39.564 --> 02:25:43.134
WORKED HARD TO PASS AND PROTECT.

02:25:43.201 --> 02:25:45.002
HOTELS ALSO BRING LASTING

02:25:45.069 --> 02:25:46.637
IMPACTS, WHICH MAKES THEM BETTER

02:25:46.704 --> 02:25:49.240
SUITED FOR NORMAL LOCAL REVIEW,

02:25:49.307 --> 02:25:52.543
NOT FAST TRACKING. THIS BILL

02:25:52.610 --> 02:25:54.212
TAKES A CLEAR STEP. IT REMOVES

02:25:54.278 --> 02:25:55.713
TRANSIENT LODGING FROM

02:25:55.780 --> 02:25:57.849
ELIGIBILITY UNDER STATE HOUSING,

02:25:57.915 --> 02:25:59.283
STREAMLINING LAWS. AND TO BE

02:25:59.350 --> 02:26:02.587
CLEAR, SB 838 DOES NOT BAN

02:26:02.653 --> 02:26:04.589
HOTELS. IF YOU WANT TO INCLUDE A

02:26:04.655 --> 02:26:06.124
HOTEL, THAT PART OF THE PROJECT

02:26:06.190 --> 02:26:07.225
SHOULD GO THROUGH THE REGULAR

02:26:07.291 --> 02:26:09.760
LOCAL PROCESS. THIS BILL IS A

02:26:09.827 --> 02:26:11.295
TARGETED PRO HOUSING MEASURE

02:26:11.362 --> 02:26:12.763
THAT PROTECTS THE INTEGRITY OF

02:26:12.830 --> 02:26:14.398
THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT

02:26:14.465 --> 02:26:16.134
AND KEEPS OUR MOST IMPORTANT

02:26:16.200 --> 02:26:17.735
HOUSING, STREAMLINING LAWS

02:26:17.802 --> 02:26:19.971
FOCUSED ON BUILDING HOMES THAT'S

02:26:20.037 --> 02:26:21.606
TRULY FOCUS ON HOUSING

02:26:21.672 --> 02:26:23.841
PRODUCTION. WITH ME TODAY, WE

02:26:23.908 --> 02:26:25.643
HAVE TWO WITNESSES, MATT BROD

02:26:25.710 --> 02:26:27.778

CASTRO, HOUSING AND

02:26:29.247 --> 02:26:30.548
TRANSPORTATION DIRECTOR AT

02:26:30.615 --> 02:26:33.151
WORKING PARTNERSHIPS IN WORKING

02:26:35.419 --> 02:26:36.754
MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS, MATT

BROD HERE ON BEHALF OF UNITE

02:26:38.089 --> 02:26:39.590
HERE INTERNATIONAL UNION,

02:26:39.657 --> 02:26:42.894
SPONSORS OF SB 838. THE CONCEPT

02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:44.495
BEHIND THIS BILL IS VERY SIMPLE.

02:26:44.562 --> 02:26:46.130
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO CLARIFY

02:26:46.197 --> 02:26:48.032
THAT STREAMLINING UNDER THE H.R.

02:26:48.099 --> 02:26:51.169
IS FOR HOUSING PROJECTS AND NOT

02:26:51.235 --> 02:26:51.802
INADVERTENTLY, HOTELS, WHICH HAS

02:26:51.869 --> 02:26:53.671
BEEN THE STATUS QUO FOR THE

02:26:53.738 --> 02:26:54.772
PRETTY MUCH THE COURSE OF THE

02:26:54.839 --> 02:26:56.874
LAST 50 YEARS. WE HAVE PUT

02:26:56.941 --> 02:26:59.010
SIMILAR LANGUAGE IN A NUMBER OF

02:26:59.076 --> 02:26:59.844
STREAMLINING BILLS ALREADY SEEN

02:26:59.911 --> 02:27:01.746
BY THIS COMMITTEE THIS YEAR AND

02:27:01.812 --> 02:27:04.482
LAST YEAR, INCLUDING AB 130, THE

02:27:04.549 --> 02:27:07.318
INFILL BUDGET TRAILER BILL, AB

02:27:07.385 --> 02:27:11.656
87, SB 92, AB 507 AS WELL AS AB

02:27:11.722 --> 02:27:14.592
1893 AND AB 3068 LAST YEAR. AND

02:27:14.659 --> 02:27:17.061
THEREIN LIES THE NEED FOR SB

02:27:17.128 --> 02:27:18.896
838. INSTEAD OF PLAYING WHACK A

02:27:18.963 --> 02:27:20.698
MOLE WITH NEW STREAMLINING

02:27:20.765 --> 02:27:23.034
BILLS, THE IDEA IS TO SITE TO

02:27:23.100 --> 02:27:24.969
THE DEFINITION OF A MIXED USE

02:27:25.036 --> 02:27:26.571
HOUSING PROJECT IN THE H.R,

02:27:26.637 --> 02:27:27.838
WHICH MANY OF OUR STATE

02:27:27.905 --> 02:27:29.941
STREAMLINING LAWS FLOW FROM.

02:27:30.007 --> 02:27:32.210
THIS ISN'T A HYPOTHETICAL

02:27:32.276 --> 02:27:33.578
PROBLEM. THE SENATOR MENTIONED A

02:27:33.644 --> 02:27:34.946
NUMBER OF PROJECTS THAT WE'VE

02:27:35.012 --> 02:27:37.281
SEEN REALLY POP UP JUST IN THE

02:27:37.348 --> 02:27:41.052
LAST YEAR, AND SB 838 WILL

02:27:41.118 --> 02:27:42.787
SIMPLY ENSURE THAT STREAMLINING

02:27:42.853 --> 02:27:45.456
LAWS ARE BEING USED APPROPRIATE

02:27:45.523 --> 02:27:46.657
APPROPRIATELY, WHICH IS

02:27:46.724 --> 02:27:47.692
IMPERATIVE TO MAKE SURE WE

02:27:47.758 --> 02:27:49.093
ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS. I

02:27:49.160 --> 02:27:50.962
WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND

02:27:51.028 --> 02:27:52.697
REITERATE THAT WE ARE REMOVING

02:27:52.763 --> 02:27:54.865
RETROACTIVITY LATER THIS

02:27:54.932 --> 02:27:56.767
AFTERNOON IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT

02:27:56.834 --> 02:27:57.835
COMMITTEE, AND I ALSO WANT TO

02:27:57.902 --> 02:28:00.037
SAY I JUST FOR THE FOR THE FIRST

02:28:00.104 --> 02:28:01.839
TIME, HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH

02:28:01.906 --> 02:28:03.941
THE OPPOSITION IN DETAIL ABOUT

02:28:04.008 --> 02:28:06.811
THEIR CONCERNS. AND WE'RE 100%

02:28:06.877 --> 02:28:08.846
COMMITTED TO TRYING TO ADDRESS

02:28:08.913 --> 02:28:10.281
THOSE CONCERNS AND MAKE SURE

02:28:10.348 --> 02:28:12.016
THAT WE'RE NOT CASTING TOO BROAD

02:28:12.083 --> 02:28:13.918
OF A BRUSH HERE. WE'RE NOT

02:28:13.985 --> 02:28:15.119
TRYING TO STOP THE DEVELOPMENT

02:28:15.186 --> 02:28:16.354
OF HOUSING PROJECTS. WE'RE JUST

02:28:16.420 --> 02:28:19.457
TRYING TO SAY WITH RESPECT TO

02:28:19.523 --> 02:28:21.859
HOTELS, LET'S THINK ABOUT THE

02:28:21.926 --> 02:28:26.597
UNIQUE, INSENSITIVE IMPACTS THAT

02:28:26.664 --> 02:28:28.332
AND WITH THAT, I WOULD JUST SAY

02:28:28.399 --> 02:28:29.867
WE NEED THE BILL TO MOVE

02:28:29.934 --> 02:28:32.036
FORWARD, TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT

02:28:32.103 --> 02:28:33.404
DISCUSSION. BUT YOU HAVE OUR

02:28:33.471 --> 02:28:34.205
COMMITMENT. I'M HERE TO ANSWER

02:28:34.272 --> 02:28:36.407

JUSTICE AT WORKING PARTNERSHIPS

02:28:43.981 --> 02:28:46.083
USA. WORKING PARTNERSHIPS IS A

02:28:46.150 --> 02:28:47.084
SILICON VALLEY BASED COMMUNITY

02:28:47.151 --> 02:28:48.486
GROUP THAT WORKS PRIMARILY

02:28:48.552 --> 02:28:49.320
THROUGHOUT SANTA CLARA COUNTY

02:28:49.387 --> 02:28:51.689
THAT TACKLES THE ROOT CAUSES OF

02:28:51.756 --> 02:28:53.190
INEQUALITY AND POVERTY BY

02:28:53.257 --> 02:28:53.958

DURAZO WITH. THIS BILL IS

02:29:03.267 --> 02:29:04.035
CRUCIAL TO ENSURING THAT

02:29:04.101 --> 02:29:04.802
CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING

02:29:04.869 --> 02:29:05.836
STREAMLINING LAWS REMAIN FOCUSED

02:29:05.903 --> 02:29:07.938
ON THE ORIGINAL INTENT,

02:29:08.005 --> 02:29:09.373
FACILITATING THE DEVELOPMENT OF

02:29:09.440 --> 02:29:10.541
AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR

02:29:10.608 --> 02:29:12.576
RESIDENTS, NOT EXPEDITING HOTEL

02:29:12.643 --> 02:29:14.845
CONSTRUCTION. AS WE ALL KNOW

02:29:14.912 --> 02:29:15.846
FROM DISCUSSIONS TODAY AND

02:29:15.913 --> 02:29:17.114
THROUGHOUT ALL OF YOUR WORK, WE

02:29:17.181 --> 02:29:19.317
ARE GRAPPLING WITH A VERY SEVERE

02:29:19.383 --> 02:29:19.984
HOUSING CRISIS. WE'RE TODAY

02:29:20.051 --> 02:29:20.851
ALONE. WE'VE DISCUSSED

02:29:20.918 --> 02:29:23.087
HOMELESSNESS, HABITABILITY AND

02:29:23.154 --> 02:29:25.222
OTHER REALLY SERIOUS CAUSES THAT

02:29:25.289 --> 02:29:27.792
ARE AFFECTING FOLKS ABILITY TO

02:29:27.858 --> 02:29:29.493
SECURE AND FIND HOUSING AND STAY

02:29:29.560 --> 02:29:32.430
HOUSED. THESE ARE ALL VULNERABLE

02:29:32.496 --> 02:29:33.831
EFFORTS THAT WE HAVE BEEN

02:29:33.898 --> 02:29:35.366
SUPPORTIVE OF AND CONTINUE TO

02:29:35.433 --> 02:29:36.767
SUPPORT. AND FOR THAT REASON,

02:29:36.834 --> 02:29:38.869
WE'RE HERE TO ENSURE THAT ANY

02:29:38.936 --> 02:29:41.839
EFFORTS TO STREAMLINE OR REDUCE

02:29:41.906 --> 02:29:43.941
BARRIERS TO CREATE HOUSING ARE

02:29:44.008 --> 02:29:45.543
FOCUSED ON JUST THAT. ADDRESSING

02:29:45.609 --> 02:29:47.078
OUR HOUSING SHORTAGE, HOWEVER,

02:29:47.144 --> 02:29:48.245
THERE'S A GROWING CONCERN THAT

02:29:48.312 --> 02:29:49.580
THE BENEFITS OF THESE

02:29:49.647 --> 02:29:50.414
STREAMLINING LAWS ARE BEING

02:29:50.481 --> 02:29:52.183
EXTENDED TO HOTEL DEVELOPMENTS,

02:29:52.249 --> 02:29:53.551
WHICH DIVERTS RESOURCES AND

02:29:53.617 --> 02:29:55.086
ATTENTION AWAY FROM BUILDING

02:29:55.152 --> 02:29:56.087
HOMES, WHICH WE DESPERATELY

02:29:56.153 --> 02:29:58.589
NEED. HOTELS, WHILE BENEFICIAL

02:29:58.656 --> 02:30:00.891
FOR TOURISM, DO NOT ADDRESS THE

02:30:00.958 --> 02:30:01.459
PRESSING NEED FOR PERMANENT

02:30:01.525 --> 02:30:03.661
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SB 838 SEEKS

STREAMLINING APPROVAL PROCESSES

02:30:06.397 --> 02:30:07.398
THAT ARE INTENDED SOLELY FOR

02:30:07.465 --> 02:30:08.733
HOUSING PROJECTS, WHICH, BY

02:30:08.799 --> 02:30:10.501
DOING SO, CAN ENSURE THAT OUR

02:30:10.568 --> 02:30:11.635
POLICIES REMAIN ALIGNED WITH THE

02:30:11.702 --> 02:30:12.837
GOAL OF PROVIDING SAFE,

02:30:12.903 --> 02:30:14.205
AFFORDABLE HOMES FOR EVERYONE.

02:30:14.271 --> 02:30:15.406
WHEN THINKING ABOUT THE QUALITY

02:30:15.473 --> 02:30:16.807
OF A PROJECT, IT'S IMPORTANT TO

STREAMLINING TO FOCUS ON

02:30:29.820 --> 02:30:30.688

COMMERCIAL USE FOR ALL MIXED USE

02:31:47.898 --> 02:31:49.467

WHICH IS REALLY RESULTED IN THE

02:32:02.613 --> 02:32:04.014
PERSISTENT LACK OF HOUSING AT

BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE,

02:32:18.095 --> 02:32:20.331
MR. KALRA. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR.

02:32:20.397 --> 02:32:22.132
I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL. THERE

02:32:22.199 --> 02:32:23.834
IS A MOTION ALREADY AND THANK

02:32:23.901 --> 02:32:25.269
THE SENATOR FOR BEING FORWARD.

02:32:25.336 --> 02:32:26.403
THANK YOU. THANKS TO MR. CASTRO

02:32:26.470 --> 02:32:27.738
WITH THE WORKING PARTNERSHIPS

02:32:27.805 --> 02:32:29.807
WHO I'VE WORKED WITH FOR MANY

02:32:29.874 --> 02:32:34.545
YEARS. AND I JUST THINK THIS IS

02:32:34.612 --> 02:32:35.412
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE

02:32:35.479 --> 02:32:37.781
WHEN WE PASS THESE KINDS OF THE

02:32:37.848 --> 02:32:41.018
LEGISLATION TO EXPEDITE OR HELP

02:32:41.085 --> 02:32:41.485
FACILITATE FOR HOUSING

02:32:41.552 --> 02:32:43.254
DEVELOPMENT IS FOR HOUSING. AND

02:32:43.320 --> 02:32:44.688
I THINK SOMETIMES OPPOSITION

02:32:44.755 --> 02:32:46.891
TELLS ON ITSELF WHEN THEY ALSO

02:32:46.957 --> 02:32:48.659
SHOW UP SAYING, HEY, WE NEED TO

02:32:48.726 --> 02:32:49.793
PASS THESE BILLS HOUSING. AND

02:32:49.860 --> 02:32:51.829
THEN WHEN WE SAY, WAIT A SECOND,

02:32:51.896 --> 02:32:53.597
IT'S NOT BUILDING A HOTEL. AND

02:32:53.664 --> 02:32:54.798
IN THE LUXURY PART, I MEAN, ONE

02:32:54.865 --> 02:32:56.166
OF THE HIGHEST REAL ESTATE

02:32:56.233 --> 02:32:58.369
MARKETS IN THE COUNTRY,

02:32:58.435 --> 02:32:59.737
SARATOGA, IS BUILDING A HOTEL.

02:32:59.803 --> 02:33:01.038
THAT IS DEFINITELY NOT WHAT WE

02:33:01.105 --> 02:33:04.308
HAD IN MIND. AND SO I APPRECIATE

02:33:04.375 --> 02:33:06.610
US REFOCUSING AND THAT IF WE'RE

02:33:06.677 --> 02:33:09.446
GOING TO GIVE DEVELOPERS THE

02:33:09.513 --> 02:33:10.714
ABILITY TO STREAMLINE AND BUILD

02:33:10.781 --> 02:33:12.650
MORE QUICKLY OVER LOCAL

02:33:12.716 --> 02:33:15.152
JURISDICTIONS, SAY IT BETTER

02:33:15.219 --> 02:33:17.087
DARN WELL BE FOR HOUSING AND

02:33:17.154 --> 02:33:18.589
PARTICULARLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

02:33:18.656 --> 02:33:20.624
SO I WOULD LOVE TO ADD AS A

02:33:20.691 --> 02:33:21.859
COAUTHOR AND I APPRECIATE YOU

02:33:21.926 --> 02:33:22.893
BRINGING IT FORWARD. SORRY.

02:33:22.960 --> 02:33:25.596
BEFORE I GO TO MISS WICKS, I DID

02:33:25.663 --> 02:33:26.864
NOT ALLOW OTHER FOLKS WHO ARE IN

02:33:26.931 --> 02:33:28.165
OPPOSITION TO COME UP AND STATE.

02:33:28.232 --> 02:33:29.833
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. HOLLY. FOR

02:33:29.900 --> 02:33:31.168
MANY DAYS, THE LIGHTHOUSE PUBLIC

02:33:31.235 --> 02:33:33.270
AFFAIRS ON BEHALF OF SPUR AND

02:33:33.337 --> 02:33:34.371
JUST ECHOING THE COMMENTS FROM

02:33:34.438 --> 02:33:36.907
THE REALTORS EARLIER. THANK YOU.

02:33:36.974 --> 02:33:37.875
GOOD MORNING, MR. CHAIR AND

02:33:37.942 --> 02:33:39.677
MEMBERS, ON BEHALF OF THE

02:33:39.743 --> 02:33:40.811
CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY

02:33:40.878 --> 02:33:41.979
ASSOCIATION, WE ALIGN OUR

02:33:42.046 --> 02:33:43.380
COMMENTS WITH THOSE MADE BY THE

02:33:43.447 --> 02:33:44.481
REALTORS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

02:33:44.548 --> 02:33:47.251
GREAT. MISS WICKS, THANK YOU.

02:33:47.318 --> 02:33:49.787
OKAY, SO WE'VE HAD SOME ROBUST

02:33:49.853 --> 02:33:50.921
CONVERSATION OUTSIDE OF

02:33:50.988 --> 02:33:52.389
COMMITTEE, AND I WANTED TO JUST

02:33:52.456 --> 02:33:53.824
BRING THAT CONVERSATION INTO

02:33:53.891 --> 02:33:57.361
PUBLIC VIEW NOW. AND I DON'T I'M

02:33:57.428 --> 02:33:58.896
HAPPY TO HEAR FROM EITHER THE

02:33:58.963 --> 02:34:00.564
AUTHOR OR THE SPONSORS,

02:34:00.631 --> 02:34:01.799
WHICHEVER YOU'RE COMFORTABLE

02:34:01.865 --> 02:34:04.602
WITH, SENATOR. BUT I THINK I

02:34:04.668 --> 02:34:06.337
WANT TO START OFF WITH FIRST OF

02:34:06.403 --> 02:34:07.905
MAYBE LIKE A TANGIBLE EXAMPLE OF

02:34:07.972 --> 02:34:09.273
THE PROBLEM THAT THAT YOU'RE ALL

02:34:09.340 --> 02:34:11.075
TRYING TO SOLVE FOR TO, TO HELP

02:34:11.141 --> 02:34:12.643
KIND OF THINK THROUGH

02:34:12.710 --> 02:34:14.778
CRYSTALLIZE. I THINK SOME OF THE

02:34:14.845 --> 02:34:16.680
QUESTIONS I'LL HAVE BASED ON

02:34:16.747 --> 02:34:19.016
THAT. SURE. THROUGH THE CHAIR

02:34:19.083 --> 02:34:21.585
MATT BRADFORD UNITE HERE, THE

02:34:21.652 --> 02:34:23.687
EXAMPLE WE DISCUSSED IN THE

02:34:23.754 --> 02:34:25.055
HALLWAY, I THINK IS A PERFECT

02:34:25.122 --> 02:34:26.590
EXAMPLE IN SANTA MONICA, WHERE

02:34:26.657 --> 02:34:29.126
YOU HAD 100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:34:29.193 --> 02:34:32.429
PROJECT THAT THAT WAS APPROVED

02:34:32.496 --> 02:34:34.832
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL, AND THEN THE

02:34:34.898 --> 02:34:37.067
DEVELOPER CAME BACK AND FOR

02:34:37.134 --> 02:34:38.836
WHATEVER REASON, MAYBE IT MADE

02:34:38.902 --> 02:34:41.338
MORE FINANCIAL SENSE, DECIDED TO

02:34:41.405 --> 02:34:44.541
DISPLACE ONE THIRD OF THE UNITS

02:34:44.608 --> 02:34:45.743
FOR LUXURY HOTEL ROOMS. AND IN

02:34:45.809 --> 02:34:49.279
THAT CASE, ACTUALLY DISPLACED

02:34:49.346 --> 02:34:50.214
WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE

02:34:50.280 --> 02:34:52.049
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. YOU KNOW, WE

02:34:52.116 --> 02:34:54.418
THINK THAT'S A PRIME EXAMPLE OF

02:34:54.485 --> 02:34:56.387
WHERE HOTEL DEVELOPMENT CAN BE

02:34:56.453 --> 02:34:58.522
PARASITIC OF OUR ABILITY TO USE

02:34:58.589 --> 02:35:01.592
THESE LAWS TO STREAMLINE HOUSING

02:35:01.659 --> 02:35:04.028
AND NOT HOTELS. AND I THINK THE

02:35:04.094 --> 02:35:04.895
OTHER EXAMPLE THAT I THINK YOU

02:35:04.962 --> 02:35:07.064
AND I DISCUSSED, BUT TO MAKE

02:35:07.131 --> 02:35:08.065
SURE I UNDERSTAND IT, IS AFTER

02:35:08.132 --> 02:35:09.166
THE PROJECT IS BUILT THERE,

02:35:09.233 --> 02:35:12.269
THERE WOULD BE CONVERSION OF THE

02:35:12.336 --> 02:35:14.138
RESIDENTIAL HOUSING UNITS TO

02:35:14.204 --> 02:35:15.039
HOTELS. YOU WERE MENTIONING KIND

02:35:15.105 --> 02:35:17.274
OF THE STUDIO LAYOUT OF THAT

02:35:17.341 --> 02:35:18.676
BEING A CONCERN. SURE. SO YEAH,

02:35:18.742 --> 02:35:20.477
JUST TO CLARIFY FOR EVERYBODY,

02:35:20.544 --> 02:35:23.514
THE CONCERN IS THAT THE BUILD OF

02:35:23.580 --> 02:35:25.249
A HOTEL IS VERY SIMILAR TO A

02:35:25.315 --> 02:35:26.283
STUDIO APARTMENT. THERE ARE

02:35:26.350 --> 02:35:28.018
COMPANIES OUT THERE IN

02:35:28.085 --> 02:35:29.186
CALIFORNIA AND OTHER STATES THAT

02:35:29.253 --> 02:35:31.689
SORT OF SPECIALIZE IN CONVERTING

02:35:31.755 --> 02:35:33.524
WHAT WOULD BE STUDIO, EMPTY,

02:35:33.590 --> 02:35:34.925
UNOCCUPIED STUDIO APARTMENTS

02:35:34.992 --> 02:35:36.794
INTO HOTEL ROOMS. AND SO YOU

02:35:36.860 --> 02:35:39.630
COULD GAME AROUND THE ONE THIRD

02:35:39.697 --> 02:35:41.131
TWO THIRDS RATIO WITHIN THE

02:35:41.198 --> 02:35:43.600
HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT AND

02:35:43.667 --> 02:35:45.135
POTENTIALLY HAVE A PROJECT THAT

02:35:45.202 --> 02:35:46.437
COULD BECOME TWO THIRDS HOTEL

02:35:46.503 --> 02:35:48.305
AND ONE THIRD HOUSING OR ONE

02:35:48.372 --> 02:35:50.808
HALF HOTEL, ONE HALF HOUSING.

02:35:50.874 --> 02:35:52.276
ADDITIONALLY, ONE OTHER THING

02:35:52.342 --> 02:35:53.677
I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT IS THAT

02:35:53.744 --> 02:35:55.045
UNDER THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY

02:35:55.112 --> 02:35:56.914
ACT, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SQUARE

02:35:56.980 --> 02:35:58.816
FOOTAGE. AND THE REALITY OF

02:35:58.882 --> 02:36:01.485
HOTEL DEVELOPMENT IS THAT THE

02:36:01.552 --> 02:36:03.454
HOTEL ROOMS ARE SMALLER THAN ONE

02:36:03.520 --> 02:36:05.823
BEDROOM, TWO BEDROOM OR BIGGER

02:36:05.889 --> 02:36:07.191
APARTMENTS. AND SO POTENTIALLY

02:36:07.257 --> 02:36:09.426
YOU COULD HAVE A UNIT THAT FIT

02:36:09.493 --> 02:36:13.297
AT THE TIME, FITS INTO FITS INTO

02:36:13.363 --> 02:36:15.232
THE ONE THIRD A HOTEL. BUT IN

02:36:15.299 --> 02:36:16.767
TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF ROOMS,

02:36:16.834 --> 02:36:18.435
IT'S ACTUALLY CREATING THE

02:36:18.502 --> 02:36:20.270
PROJECTS MORE LIKE HALF AND HALF

02:36:20.337 --> 02:36:22.539
BECAUSE YOU HAVE SO MANY SMALL

02:36:22.606 --> 02:36:25.042
HOTEL ROOMS VERSUS WHAT WOULD

02:36:25.109 --> 02:36:26.443
OTHERWISE MAYBE POTENTIALLY BE

02:36:26.510 --> 02:36:27.878
DEVELOPED AS HOUSING. AND SO IS

02:36:27.945 --> 02:36:29.079
THAT HAPPENING RIGHT NOW, WHAT

02:36:29.146 --> 02:36:31.482
YOU JUST DESCRIBED? YES, YES.

02:36:31.548 --> 02:36:34.051
AND, YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN

02:36:34.118 --> 02:36:37.187
WORKING CLOSELY WITH YOUR OFFICE

02:36:37.254 --> 02:36:38.622
FOR THE PAST YEAR, SORT OF

02:36:38.689 --> 02:36:41.625
THINKING ABOUT HOW TO BE

02:36:41.692 --> 02:36:42.659
PROACTIVE WITH STREAMLINING LAWS

02:36:42.726 --> 02:36:44.428
AND MAKE SURE THAT THESE AREN'T

02:36:44.495 --> 02:36:45.462
ABUSES ARE HAPPENING. THE REASON

02:36:45.529 --> 02:36:47.364
WE DECIDED TO DO THIS BILL THIS

02:36:47.431 --> 02:36:49.800
YEAR WAS NOT JUST BECAUSE OF

02:36:49.867 --> 02:36:51.702
WHACK A MOLE, BUT FOR THE FIRST

02:36:51.769 --> 02:36:54.138
TIME, REALLY AT THE END OF 2023,

02:36:54.204 --> 02:36:56.306
2024, WE SAW A SPATE OF THESE

02:36:56.373 --> 02:36:58.142
PROJECTS, WHETHER IT WAS IN THE

02:36:58.208 --> 02:36:59.443
HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT, THIS

02:36:59.510 --> 02:37:01.278
COMMITTEE SAU LEGISLATION

02:37:01.345 --> 02:37:03.113
RELATED TO THE DENSITY BONUS

02:37:03.180 --> 02:37:04.948
LAW, WHERE THERE WAS

02:37:05.015 --> 02:37:07.451
GAMESMANSHIP AROUND USING

02:37:07.518 --> 02:37:09.319
STREAMLINING UNDER THESE LAWS TO

02:37:09.386 --> 02:37:10.654
DEVELOP A HOTEL BECAUSE THEY

02:37:10.721 --> 02:37:12.990
COULD NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE IT

02:37:13.056 --> 02:37:15.492
PENCIL AND SO AND JUST SO I

02:37:15.559 --> 02:37:16.393
UNDERSTAND SO CURRENT LAW SAYS

02:37:16.460 --> 02:37:17.828
UNDER THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY

02:37:17.895 --> 02:37:19.696
ACT, MIXED USE TO QUALIFY FOR IT

02:37:19.763 --> 02:37:21.431
WITH MIXED USE HAS TO BE A

02:37:21.498 --> 02:37:22.766
THIRD. WELL, IT CAN BE ANYTHING

02:37:22.833 --> 02:37:24.635
ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE, RIGHT.

02:37:24.701 --> 02:37:25.769
BUT IN THIS INSTANCE, A THIRD

02:37:25.836 --> 02:37:27.304
HOTEL, TWO THIRDS RESIDENTIAL.

02:37:27.371 --> 02:37:29.673
THAT'S CURRENT LAW. RIGHT. AND

02:37:29.740 --> 02:37:31.542
JUST SO I UNDERSTAND THIS BILL

02:37:31.608 --> 02:37:33.110
AS, AS YOU'RE PROPOSING IT

02:37:33.177 --> 02:37:35.312
TODAY, BASICALLY SAYS IF YOU'RE

02:37:35.379 --> 02:37:36.947
GOING TO ENJOY THE BENEFITS OF

02:37:37.014 --> 02:37:38.081
THAT HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY

02:37:38.148 --> 02:37:39.583
HOTEL CANNOT BE CONSIDERED FOR

02:37:39.650 --> 02:37:41.318
PART OF THIS PROJECT. IS THAT

02:37:41.385 --> 02:37:42.286
CORRECT? SO THAT'S REALLY

02:37:42.352 --> 02:37:43.787
ACTUALLY NOT OUR INTENTION. OUR

02:37:43.854 --> 02:37:45.255
INTENTION IS TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:37:45.322 --> 02:37:47.791
FOR THE HOTEL COMPONENT, IT'S

02:37:47.858 --> 02:37:49.126
SUBJECT TO TRADITIONAL ZONING.

02:37:49.193 --> 02:37:50.994
AND THE WAY THAT ZONING WORKS

02:37:51.061 --> 02:37:52.529
FOR HOTELS IS IF YOU CONFORM TO

02:37:52.596 --> 02:37:54.164
THE LOCAL COMMUNITY PLAN, YOU

02:37:54.231 --> 02:37:56.066
CAN ACTUALLY DEVELOP THAT HOTEL.

02:37:56.133 --> 02:37:58.569
BY RIGHT. OUR EXPERIENCE IS THAT

02:37:58.635 --> 02:38:00.003
HOTELS THAT ARE VERY ATTRACTIVE

02:38:00.070 --> 02:38:01.805
FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. I SPOKE

02:38:01.872 --> 02:38:03.540
WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER ÃVILA

02:38:03.607 --> 02:38:04.575
FARÃAS YESTERDAY AND SHE SAID

02:38:04.641 --> 02:38:06.143
HER DISTRICT WOULD LOVE. THEY

02:38:06.210 --> 02:38:09.413
WOULD KILL TO GET A HOTEL IN

02:38:09.479 --> 02:38:11.148
MARTINEZ, AND I THINK THAT'S A

02:38:11.215 --> 02:38:13.417
FAIR POINT. BUT WHAT WHAT WE'RE

02:38:13.483 --> 02:38:14.952
TRYING TO MAKE, WE'RE NOT TRYING

02:38:15.018 --> 02:38:16.386
TO EVEN STOP THE DEVELOPMENT OF

02:38:16.453 --> 02:38:18.088
HOTELS. HOTELS CAN STILL BE

02:38:18.155 --> 02:38:18.789
DEVELOPED. THEY JUST WE DON'T

02:38:18.856 --> 02:38:20.991
WANT THEM TO BE STREAMLINED

02:38:21.058 --> 02:38:23.594
UNDER HOUSING LAWS. RIGHT. BUT I

02:38:23.660 --> 02:38:25.596
UNDERSTAND THE INTENT, BUT I

02:38:25.662 --> 02:38:26.663
WHAT I SEE IS THAT THIS

02:38:26.730 --> 02:38:28.098
BASICALLY SAYS HOTELS CANNOT BE

02:38:28.165 --> 02:38:29.233
CONSIDERED AS PART OF THE MIXED

02:38:29.299 --> 02:38:30.601
USE COMMERCIAL PORTION OF THIS

02:38:30.667 --> 02:38:32.069
TO GET THE HOUSING

02:38:32.135 --> 02:38:33.604
ACCOUNTABILITY STREAMLINING FOR

02:38:33.670 --> 02:38:36.306
THE HOUSING PORTION OF THIS.

02:38:36.373 --> 02:38:38.175
RIGHT. AND AGAIN, THAT'S NOT THE

02:38:38.242 --> 02:38:40.277
INTENT. YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT

02:38:40.344 --> 02:38:41.345
THIS OUTSIDE THE COMMITTEE ROOM.

02:38:41.411 --> 02:38:44.014
AND I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT

02:38:44.081 --> 02:38:46.116
WE ARE COMMITTED TO, TO WORKING

02:38:46.183 --> 02:38:48.652
ON CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS THAT

02:38:48.719 --> 02:38:50.087
REALLY SAY WE'RE TALKING

02:38:50.153 --> 02:38:51.288
NARROWLY ABOUT THE HOTEL PORTION

02:38:51.355 --> 02:38:53.023
AND NOT THE REST OF THE PROJECT.

02:38:53.090 --> 02:38:55.392
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO BLUNT THE

02:38:55.459 --> 02:38:56.793
DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING PROJECTS

02:38:56.860 --> 02:38:58.629
UNDER THE HA. WHAT WE'RE TRYING

02:38:58.695 --> 02:39:00.831
TO DO IS AVOID COMING BACK TO

02:39:00.898 --> 02:39:02.299
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE BILLS,

02:39:02.366 --> 02:39:03.433
WHETHER THEY'RE YOUR BILLS,

02:39:03.500 --> 02:39:04.101
WHETHER THEY'RE THE CHAIR'S

02:39:04.167 --> 02:39:05.969
BILLS OR ANYBODY ELSE'S BILLS.

02:39:06.036 --> 02:39:08.038
AND DO THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN WHEN

02:39:08.105 --> 02:39:10.540
WE COULD SORT OF SET AS A POLICY

02:39:10.607 --> 02:39:12.276
GOAL HOUSING, STREAMLINING, GOOD

02:39:12.342 --> 02:39:13.710
FOR HOUSING, NOT FOR HOTELS,

02:39:13.777 --> 02:39:14.912
BECAUSE I THINK WHAT YOU'RE

02:39:14.978 --> 02:39:16.680
TRYING TO SOLVE FOR IS A REAL

02:39:16.747 --> 02:39:17.781
PROBLEM THAT SHOULD BE SOLVED

02:39:17.848 --> 02:39:19.149
FOR. AND I APPRECIATE THE

02:39:19.216 --> 02:39:20.684
AUTHOR'S WORK IN THIS SPACE, AND

02:39:20.751 --> 02:39:22.653
I SUPPORT THAT IN CONCEPT. I

02:39:22.719 --> 02:39:24.321
THINK IN REALITY OF WHAT I SEE

02:39:24.388 --> 02:39:25.689
IN THE BILL, MY CONCERNS OF IT

02:39:25.756 --> 02:39:27.791
ARE RIGHT NOW IS THAT IT'S TOO

02:39:27.858 --> 02:39:29.026
FAR REACHING. AND YOU HAVE YOU

02:39:29.092 --> 02:39:30.027
DO HAVE DEVELOPERS THAT ARE

02:39:30.093 --> 02:39:31.828
PLAYING BY THE RULES THAT ARE

02:39:31.895 --> 02:39:32.996
DOING THE ONE THIRD, TWO THIRD,

02:39:33.063 --> 02:39:34.831
AND TO TAKE THAT TOOL AWAY FROM

02:39:34.898 --> 02:39:37.501
THEM AND TAKE AWAY AN ABILITY TO

02:39:37.567 --> 02:39:38.268
MAKE PROJECTS FEASIBLE FOR

02:39:38.335 --> 02:39:39.369
PEOPLE THAT ARE PLAYING FAIR TO

02:39:39.436 --> 02:39:40.904
ME, IS A BRIDGE TOO FAR RIGHT

02:39:40.971 --> 02:39:43.307
NOW. BUT I KNOW WE HAD

02:39:43.373 --> 02:39:44.107
CONVERSATIONS, AND IT'S MY HOPE

02:39:44.174 --> 02:39:45.809
THAT IF THE BILL MOVES OUT OF

02:39:45.876 --> 02:39:46.777
COMMITTEE THAT THAT THE

02:39:46.843 --> 02:39:47.844
OPPOSITION AND THE SUPPORTERS

02:39:47.911 --> 02:39:49.713
CAN WORK TOGETHER ON TRYING TO

02:39:49.780 --> 02:39:51.114
COME UP WITH A SOLUTION THAT I

02:39:51.181 --> 02:39:52.649
THINK HONORS WHAT YOU'RE

02:39:52.716 --> 02:39:53.717
ACTUALLY TRYING TO DO WITHOUT

02:39:53.784 --> 02:39:55.519
TAKING IT TOO FAR. I'M GOING TO

02:39:55.585 --> 02:39:56.887
LAY OFF TODAY BECAUSE I'M NOT

02:39:56.954 --> 02:39:58.789
COMFORTABLE WITH THE BILL AS IS,

02:39:58.855 --> 02:40:00.290
BUT IT'S MY HOPE THAT IF THERE'S

02:40:00.357 --> 02:40:01.591
AGREEMENT REACHED ON THE FLOOR,

02:40:01.658 --> 02:40:03.327
IT'S SOMETHING I CAN SUPPORT

02:40:03.393 --> 02:40:04.161
THAT WILL NOT HAVE THE NEGATIVE,

02:40:04.227 --> 02:40:04.928
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF

02:40:04.995 --> 02:40:05.729
ACTUALLY HURTING HOUSING

02:40:05.796 --> 02:40:07.331
PRODUCTION FOR FOLKS THAT ARE

02:40:07.397 --> 02:40:08.532
ACTUALLY USING THE HOUSING

02:40:08.598 --> 02:40:09.232
ACCOUNTABILITY ACT, THE

02:40:09.299 --> 02:40:10.634
COMMERCIAL PORTION OF IT, WITH

02:40:10.701 --> 02:40:12.636
HOTEL IN THE WAY IT'S INTENDED

02:40:12.703 --> 02:40:14.338
TO BE. SO THAT'S I JUST WANT TO

02:40:14.404 --> 02:40:16.640
GO ON THE RECORD OF WHERE I AM

02:40:16.707 --> 02:40:18.308
TODAY. BUT AGAIN, I THINK THERE

02:40:18.375 --> 02:40:19.076
WAS SOME BEGINNING FRUITFUL

02:40:19.142 --> 02:40:20.143
CONVERSATIONS OUTSIDE, IF NOT

02:40:20.210 --> 02:40:21.311
LATE. AT LEAST THEY WERE.

02:40:21.378 --> 02:40:22.412
THEY'RE STARTED AND HOPEFULLY

02:40:22.479 --> 02:40:24.581
WE'LL BE ABLE TO I'LL BE ABLE TO

02:40:24.648 --> 02:40:25.882
SUPPORT IT ON THE FLOOR, BUT

02:40:25.949 --> 02:40:26.917
UNFORTUNATELY I CAN'T TODAY. GOT

02:40:26.984 --> 02:40:31.254
IT. THANK YOU, MISS WILSON.

02:40:31.321 --> 02:40:32.255
THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR

02:40:32.322 --> 02:40:36.226
BRINGING THIS FORWARD. AND MY

02:40:36.293 --> 02:40:37.894
COLLEAGUE AND I HAVE HAD SOME

02:40:37.961 --> 02:40:39.062
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS. AND SO

02:40:39.129 --> 02:40:40.964
I THINK THAT SOME OF THE

02:40:41.031 --> 02:40:42.265
CONCERNS THAT SHE BROUGHT UP

02:40:42.332 --> 02:40:44.434
ARE, ARE VALID IN A SENSE OF

02:40:44.501 --> 02:40:47.704
MAKING SURE THAT WE DON'T CAST

02:40:47.771 --> 02:40:49.806
SO WIDE A NET THAT WE IMPACT THE

02:40:49.873 --> 02:40:52.843
GOOD ACTORS, SO TO SPEAK. YOU

02:40:52.909 --> 02:40:54.544
KNOW, BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BE

02:40:54.611 --> 02:40:56.013
NUANCED IN THE POLICY THAT WE DO

02:40:56.079 --> 02:40:57.781
HERE IS THAT WE WANT TO

02:40:57.848 --> 02:40:59.649
ENCOURAGE HOUSING. WE DON'T WANT

02:40:59.716 --> 02:41:00.283
TO DISCOURAGE. WE WANT TO MAKE

02:41:00.350 --> 02:41:02.285
SURE PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING WHAT

02:41:02.352 --> 02:41:04.121
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO HAVE ALL

02:41:04.187 --> 02:41:04.988
THE TOOLS AT THEIR DISPOSAL TO

02:41:05.055 --> 02:41:06.757
BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO DO GOOD

02:41:06.823 --> 02:41:08.125
WORK. AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:41:08.191 --> 02:41:09.793
NOT, THAT WE STOP THEM AS QUICK

02:41:09.860 --> 02:41:12.229
AS POSSIBLE. I DO THINK THAT

02:41:12.295 --> 02:41:13.296
THERE ARE LOTS WHEN IT COMES TO

02:41:13.363 --> 02:41:15.065
HOTELS, EVEN IF THERE ARE ONE

02:41:15.132 --> 02:41:16.933
THIRD OF A HOUSING UNIT THERE,

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.736
THERE ARE NEEDS TO HAVE. THERE

02:41:19.803 --> 02:41:23.073
IS A NEED FOR A LOCAL AGENCY,

02:41:23.140 --> 02:41:24.875
WHETHER CITY OR COUNTY OR

02:41:24.941 --> 02:41:26.910
WHOEVER, TO BE ABLE TO MITIGATE

02:41:26.977 --> 02:41:28.812
THE IMPACTS OF THAT HOTEL AND

02:41:28.879 --> 02:41:30.080
THAT IT IS DISTINCT AND

02:41:30.147 --> 02:41:34.217
DIFFERENT THAN ADDING A STORE, A

02:41:34.284 --> 02:41:35.185
RESTAURANT OR ALL OF THOSE

02:41:35.252 --> 02:41:38.889
THINGS. AND SO WHEN IT COMES TO

02:41:38.955 --> 02:41:40.290
STREAMLINING, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE

02:41:40.357 --> 02:41:41.758
STREAMLINING AUTOMATICALLY TAKES

02:41:41.825 --> 02:41:45.629
AWAY LOCAL CONTROL, MY QUESTION

02:41:45.695 --> 02:41:48.265
ALWAYS IS WHO SHOULD BENEFIT AND

02:41:48.331 --> 02:41:50.700
WHY? AND SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING

02:41:50.767 --> 02:41:52.202
YOUR BILL TODAY. BECAUSE WHEN I

02:41:52.269 --> 02:41:54.004
THINK ABOUT STREAMLINING, I

02:41:54.071 --> 02:41:55.806
THINK THE HOUSING SHOULD

02:41:55.872 --> 02:41:57.607
BENEFIT, NOT A HOTEL BECAUSE OF

02:41:57.674 --> 02:41:59.376
THE IMPACTS THAT HOTEL HAS

02:41:59.443 --> 02:42:01.144
COMMUNITY. AND I THINK THAT

02:42:01.211 --> 02:42:03.013
NATURAL INCLINATION THAT A

02:42:03.080 --> 02:42:05.115
COMMUNITY HAS THAT I'VE SEEN

02:42:05.182 --> 02:42:07.117
SERVING IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT FOR

02:42:07.184 --> 02:42:09.586
12 YEARS, SITTING ON A COUNCIL,

02:42:09.653 --> 02:42:10.954
TALKING TO MY COLLEAGUES WHEN I

02:42:11.021 --> 02:42:14.191
GO TO CAL CITIES THAT THAT I

02:42:14.257 --> 02:42:15.992
HAVE YET TO SEE. SOME LIKE WE

02:42:16.059 --> 02:42:17.027
DON'T LIKE HOTELS, EVERYBODY

02:42:17.094 --> 02:42:19.262
WANTS HOTELS. AND SO TYPICALLY

02:42:19.329 --> 02:42:20.464
THERE'S THIS NATURAL INCLINATION

02:42:20.530 --> 02:42:22.032
TO THE PROCESS IS FIND WHAT YOU

02:42:22.099 --> 02:42:24.401
CAN DO TO EXPEDITE NATURALLY

02:42:24.468 --> 02:42:25.302
JUST BECAUSE THE INCENTIVE THAT

02:42:25.368 --> 02:42:27.137
YOU HAVE AS IT RELATES TO TOT,

02:42:27.204 --> 02:42:29.206
AND THEN ALSO BUT ALSO WANTING

02:42:29.272 --> 02:42:30.407
TO MITIGATE IMPACTS LIKE

02:42:30.474 --> 02:42:32.576
PARKING, YOU KNOW, THE ABILITY

02:42:32.642 --> 02:42:34.044
TO LIKE, GOSH, WHEN YOU HAVE A

02:42:34.111 --> 02:42:34.878
CONFERENCE OR WHEN YOU HAVE, YOU

02:42:34.945 --> 02:42:37.180
KNOW, BIG BUSSES ON A STREET AND

02:42:37.247 --> 02:42:38.949
YOU KNOW, ALL THOSE KIND OF

02:42:39.015 --> 02:42:40.717
THINGS. AND SO I WOULD SAY TO

02:42:40.784 --> 02:42:42.319
THE AUTHOR, YOU KNOW, THANK YOU

02:42:42.385 --> 02:42:43.286
FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. THANK

02:42:43.353 --> 02:42:44.855
YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO

02:42:44.921 --> 02:42:45.689
CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH THIS

02:42:45.755 --> 02:42:47.924
CASTING OF A WIDE NET TO ENSURE

02:42:47.991 --> 02:42:50.494
THAT IF THERE IS A LEGITIMATE

02:42:50.560 --> 02:42:52.629
PROJECT WHERE SOMEONE IS KEEPING

02:42:52.696 --> 02:42:55.732
TO THE TWO THIRDS, ONE THIRDS

02:42:55.799 --> 02:42:57.033
AND DOING THE, YOU KNOW,

02:42:57.100 --> 02:42:59.069
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND DOING ALL

02:42:59.136 --> 02:43:00.237
THE RIGHT BOXES, THEY ARE NOT

02:43:00.303 --> 02:43:01.938
NEGATIVELY IMPACT BECAUSE WE

02:43:02.005 --> 02:43:04.474
KNOW THAT IT IS HARD TO GET

02:43:04.541 --> 02:43:05.642
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS TO

02:43:05.709 --> 02:43:07.410
PENCIL. IT IS DIFFICULT. AND

02:43:07.477 --> 02:43:09.946
WHEN YOU CAN HAVE A GREAT

02:43:10.013 --> 02:43:11.948
COMMERCIAL COMPONENT IN THE

02:43:12.015 --> 02:43:14.151
MIXED USE CONCEPT THAT ALLOWS

02:43:14.217 --> 02:43:16.653
FOR IT TO PENCIL, YOU WANT TO BE

02:43:16.720 --> 02:43:18.822
ABLE TO DO THAT AND YOU WANT TO

02:43:18.889 --> 02:43:20.657
BE ABLE TO ENCOURAGE THAT. AND

02:43:20.724 --> 02:43:22.058
LIKE I SAID, CITIES WILL WILL

02:43:22.125 --> 02:43:22.993
ENCOURAGE HOTELS JUST BECAUSE OF

02:43:23.059 --> 02:43:25.495
THE TOT. BUT WE ALSO SEE CITIES

02:43:25.562 --> 02:43:27.998
WHO ARE BAD ACTORS WHO WILL BE

02:43:28.064 --> 02:43:29.799
LIKE, YEAH, I WANT THE HOTEL,

02:43:29.866 --> 02:43:31.902
BUT I DON'T WANT THE HOUSING,

02:43:31.968 --> 02:43:32.936
AND WE'LL USE SOMETHING LIKE

02:43:33.003 --> 02:43:35.872
THIS TO THEN PUT IMPROPER

02:43:35.939 --> 02:43:36.907
MITIGATION IMPACTS ON THE

02:43:36.973 --> 02:43:38.408
HOUSING THAT STOPS THE HOUSING

02:43:38.475 --> 02:43:39.876
ALTOGETHER, AND WE DON'T WANT TO

02:43:39.943 --> 02:43:41.678
SEE THAT. SO I THINK IT'S

02:43:41.745 --> 02:43:42.979
DEFINITELY WORTH FIXING AND

02:43:43.046 --> 02:43:45.482
APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM MY

02:43:45.549 --> 02:43:46.283
COLLEAGUES THAT THAT FLAGGED

02:43:46.349 --> 02:43:49.186
THAT CONCERN. THANK YOU, MISS

02:43:49.252 --> 02:43:56.826
QUIRK-SILVA. OKAY, MISS ÃVILA

02:43:56.893 --> 02:44:02.065
FARÃAS. THANK YOU, CHAIR. AND

02:44:02.132 --> 02:44:04.634
THANK YOU, SENATOR. I DID HAVE

02:44:04.701 --> 02:44:07.037
AN OPPORTUNITY YESTERDAY TO MEET

02:44:07.103 --> 02:44:10.073
AND DO WHAT WE CALL THE HOUSING

02:44:10.140 --> 02:44:11.875
ACROBATICS. AND WE WENT UP ONE

02:44:11.942 --> 02:44:13.276
SIDE BACK DOWN ON THE PUBLIC

02:44:13.343 --> 02:44:14.711
POLICY AROUND THIS. AND I THINK

02:44:14.778 --> 02:44:17.013
PRIOR TO MY DISCUSSION OUTSIDE

02:44:17.080 --> 02:44:20.217
THE PUBLIC SPACE, I WAS LEANING

02:44:20.283 --> 02:44:22.118
TOWARDS A NO VOTE. BUT IT TOOK

02:44:22.185 --> 02:44:24.054
ME A MINUTE TO KIND OF REALLY

02:44:24.120 --> 02:44:25.288
UNDERSTAND THE MECHANICS OF THIS

02:44:25.355 --> 02:44:27.757
BILL AND WHAT THE SPIRIT AND THE

02:44:27.824 --> 02:44:29.859
INTENT OF IT, AND I HAVE FULL

02:44:29.926 --> 02:44:32.028
FAITH AND CONFIDENCE THAT AS IT

02:44:32.095 --> 02:44:33.430
GOES THROUGH THE PROCESS, THAT

02:44:33.496 --> 02:44:35.498
WE CAN HAVE A BALANCED HOUSING

02:44:35.565 --> 02:44:38.168
APPROACH THAT ALLOWS THOUGHTFUL

02:44:38.235 --> 02:44:39.603
DEVELOPMENT ON BOTH SIDES OF,

02:44:39.669 --> 02:44:41.638
YOU KNOW, THE INNOVATION AROUND

02:44:41.705 --> 02:44:43.473
MIXED USE DEVELOPMENTS WITH

02:44:43.540 --> 02:44:45.342
HOUSING INTEGRATED WITH HOTEL,

02:44:45.408 --> 02:44:47.911
WHERE IT'S NOT BEING ABUSED, AND

02:44:47.978 --> 02:44:49.946
ALSO CREATE THE NECESSARY

02:44:50.013 --> 02:44:51.481
HOUSING STOCK THAT WE NEED

02:44:51.548 --> 02:44:52.515
THROUGHOUT OUR STATE OF

02:44:52.582 --> 02:44:54.284
CALIFORNIA. SO I FEEL

02:44:54.351 --> 02:44:55.385
COMFORTABLE TODAY SUPPORTING THE

02:44:55.452 --> 02:44:59.022
BILL BECAUSE I SPENT A GOOD TIME

02:44:59.089 --> 02:45:00.457
AMOUNT REALLY TRYING TO

02:45:00.523 --> 02:45:01.091
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE INTENT AND

02:45:01.157 --> 02:45:03.393
THE SPIRIT AND WHY IT MAY NOT BE

02:45:03.460 --> 02:45:05.862
PERFECT AT THIS PRECISE MOMENT.

02:45:05.929 --> 02:45:07.564
I SEE THE LOOPHOLE AND THE

02:45:07.631 --> 02:45:08.665
LOOPHOLES ARE USUALLY THOSE GRAY

02:45:08.732 --> 02:45:10.000
AREAS ON HOUSING POLICY THAT ARE

02:45:10.066 --> 02:45:11.868
REALLY HARD TO SEE UNLESS YOU

02:45:11.935 --> 02:45:13.937
PRACTICE IN LAND USE DEVELOPMENT

02:45:14.004 --> 02:45:15.505
OR ACTUALLY DEVELOPED IT OR

02:45:15.572 --> 02:45:16.873
FINANCED IT. AND SO WHEN WE WENT

02:45:16.940 --> 02:45:18.742
THROUGH THAT EXERCISE, I WAS

02:45:18.808 --> 02:45:20.277
ABLE TO SEE AND UNDERSTAND WHAT

02:45:20.343 --> 02:45:23.079
YOU ALL WERE TRYING TO FIX. AND

02:45:23.146 --> 02:45:26.116
IT'S REALLY VERY SMALL, BUT I

02:45:26.182 --> 02:45:28.118
CAN UNDERSTAND IT NOW. AND SO I

02:45:28.184 --> 02:45:29.686
HAVE FAITH THAT YOU ALL WILL

02:45:29.753 --> 02:45:30.687
WORK THROUGH THIS AS IT GOES

02:45:30.754 --> 02:45:32.155
THROUGH THE PROCESS, AND I WILL

02:45:32.222 --> 02:45:33.890
NOT SUPPORT A BILL THAT

02:45:33.957 --> 02:45:35.025
COMPROMISES, YOU KNOW, HOUSING

02:45:35.091 --> 02:45:36.359
PRODUCTION OR EVEN HOTEL

02:45:36.426 --> 02:45:37.727
PRODUCTION, BECAUSE I DO COME

02:45:37.794 --> 02:45:39.329
FROM A DISTRICT THAT IS

02:45:39.396 --> 02:45:41.898
DESPERATELY IN NEED OF HOTEL

02:45:41.965 --> 02:45:43.700
DEVELOPMENT IN OUR COUNTY. SO I

02:45:43.767 --> 02:45:44.968
HOPE THAT AS IT MOVES FORWARD

02:45:45.035 --> 02:45:47.037
THAT WE SEE A BALANCED APPROACH.

02:45:47.103 --> 02:45:49.472
SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU, MR.

02:45:49.539 --> 02:45:51.975
PATTERSON. GREAT. THANKS. IS A

02:45:52.042 --> 02:45:55.078
FORMER LOCAL ELECTED MYSELF. I

02:45:55.145 --> 02:45:56.579
THINK I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES

02:45:56.646 --> 02:45:58.281
THAT EVERY LOCAL GOVERNMENT

02:45:58.348 --> 02:46:02.085
OFFICIAL LIKES TO SEE HOTELS

02:46:02.152 --> 02:46:04.054
BUILT. BUT THE YOU KNOW WHO

02:46:04.120 --> 02:46:05.955
DOESN'T ARE THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE

02:46:06.022 --> 02:46:07.123
IN THAT COMMUNITY. ALMOST EVERY

02:46:07.190 --> 02:46:08.925
TIME I LOVE HOTELS, I THINK

02:46:08.992 --> 02:46:10.727
THEY'RE GREAT. BUT EVERY TIME I

02:46:10.794 --> 02:46:13.463
SEE A HOTEL PROPOSED, I'M NOT

02:46:13.530 --> 02:46:14.597
SAYING IT'S RIGHT OR WRONG, I'M

02:46:14.664 --> 02:46:16.700
JUST SAYING IT GETS A LOT OF

02:46:16.766 --> 02:46:18.468
OPPOSITION IN BASICALLY EVERY

02:46:18.535 --> 02:46:21.237
COMMUNITY THAT I'VE SEEN, WHICH

02:46:21.304 --> 02:46:22.439
I THINK IS, YOU KNOW,

02:46:22.505 --> 02:46:24.908
UNFORTUNATE A LOT OF WAYS. BUT

02:46:24.974 --> 02:46:27.877
BUT I THINK, YOU KNOW, MY

02:46:27.944 --> 02:46:29.412
CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL, AND I

02:46:29.479 --> 02:46:30.413
UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE GOING,

02:46:30.480 --> 02:46:33.750
WHERE YOU'RE GOING FOR, SENATOR,

02:46:33.817 --> 02:46:36.252
IS THAT I COULD SEE, YOU KNOW,

02:46:36.319 --> 02:46:38.154
IF THERE WERE IF THERE WAS LIKE

02:46:38.221 --> 02:46:40.056
A BUILDING WHERE COMPONENTS OF

02:46:40.123 --> 02:46:41.891
THAT BUILDING WERE HOTEL, I

02:46:41.958 --> 02:46:43.693
WOULDN'T HAVE SUCH AN ISSUE WITH

02:46:43.760 --> 02:46:46.629
THAT IN THIS BILL WOULD PRECLUDE

02:46:46.696 --> 02:46:48.398
THAT FROM OCCURRING OR GOING

02:46:48.465 --> 02:46:50.867
THROUGH THE NORMAL PROCESS. IS,

02:46:50.934 --> 02:46:54.204
THE SPONSOR SAID. BUT WHERE I

02:46:54.270 --> 02:46:56.706
COULD SEE SOME ELEMENTS THAT

02:46:56.773 --> 02:46:59.242
WOULD CONCERN ME IS, LET'S SAY

02:46:59.309 --> 02:47:01.010
THERE'S A PRETTY BIG PROJECT,

02:47:01.077 --> 02:47:02.545
MAYBE, YOU KNOW, LET'S SAY TEN

02:47:02.612 --> 02:47:03.847
BUILDINGS OR SOMETHING, AND ONE

02:47:03.913 --> 02:47:06.383
ENDS UP BEING ALMOST LIKE

02:47:06.449 --> 02:47:07.917
SEPARATE, SEPARATE FROM THE

02:47:07.984 --> 02:47:09.052
HOUSING UNITS, YOU KNOW, WHERE

02:47:09.119 --> 02:47:12.021
IT'S A STANDALONE KIND OF HOTEL.

02:47:12.088 --> 02:47:13.957
AND I THINK THAT'S SOMEWHAT I

02:47:14.023 --> 02:47:15.492
THINK THAT KIND OF WOULD BE AN

02:47:15.558 --> 02:47:17.827
ABUSE FROM A, FROM A RESIDENT

02:47:17.894 --> 02:47:20.130
PERSPECTIVE OF, OF THE INTENTION

02:47:20.196 --> 02:47:22.031
HERE. BUT, YOU KNOW, IF WE'RE

02:47:22.098 --> 02:47:23.633
TALKING MULTIPLE BUILDINGS AND

02:47:23.700 --> 02:47:25.902
ONE OF THE, ONE OF THOSE OR TWO

02:47:25.969 --> 02:47:27.370
OF THOSE BUILDINGS OR WHATEVER

02:47:27.437 --> 02:47:27.971
HAVE BOTH COMPONENTS, I DON'T

02:47:28.037 --> 02:47:29.806
THINK I REALLY HAVE A CONCERN

02:47:29.873 --> 02:47:31.040
WITH THAT. IT'S MORE OF JUST

02:47:31.107 --> 02:47:32.942
LIKE IF IT WAS AN ACTUAL WHAT I

02:47:33.009 --> 02:47:34.844
THINK IS AN ABUSE, WHERE THERE'S

02:47:34.911 --> 02:47:37.380
A STANDALONE HOTEL IN AN AREA

02:47:37.447 --> 02:47:39.549
THAT'S INTENDED FOR TAKING

02:47:39.616 --> 02:47:42.285
ADVANTAGE OF THE HOUSING, YOU

02:47:42.352 --> 02:47:45.321
KNOW, THE AB 2011, THE AUTHOR

02:47:45.388 --> 02:47:46.356
HAPPENS TO BE SITTING PRETTY

02:47:46.423 --> 02:47:51.060
CLOSE TO ME. SO I THINK IF I

02:47:51.127 --> 02:47:53.196
THINK IN TODAY'S FORM, I CAN'T

02:47:53.263 --> 02:47:57.200
SUPPORT THE BILL. I DO THINK IN

02:47:57.267 --> 02:47:58.935
IN CIRCUMSTANCES, THOUGH, WHERE

02:47:59.002 --> 02:48:01.905
THERE WERE STANDALONE HOTELS

02:48:01.971 --> 02:48:03.873
KIND OF BUILT INTO THIS PROJECT.

02:48:03.940 --> 02:48:05.775
I DO THINK LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND

02:48:05.842 --> 02:48:08.378
THE PEOPLE OF THAT COMMUNITY

02:48:08.445 --> 02:48:12.015
OUGHT TO HAVE A, A SAY IN THAT

02:48:12.081 --> 02:48:13.316
IF IT'S IN AN AREA THAT'S

02:48:13.383 --> 02:48:15.618
INTENDED FOR HOUSING, YOU KNOW,

02:48:15.685 --> 02:48:16.820
BUT I THINK IT'S A LITTLE TOO

02:48:16.886 --> 02:48:19.022
BROAD RIGHT NOW. SO I'M GOING TO

02:48:19.088 --> 02:48:21.558
LAY OFF TODAY. BUT AND FEEL FREE

02:48:21.624 --> 02:48:22.926
TO RESPOND TO THAT. OBVIOUSLY

02:48:22.992 --> 02:48:25.228
YOU DON'T HAVE TO. BUT THOSE

02:48:25.295 --> 02:48:27.063
THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS AS THEY

02:48:27.130 --> 02:48:29.666
STAND NOW. SO THANK YOU. ALL

02:48:29.732 --> 02:48:31.501
RIGHT. SEEING NO MORE COMMENTS

02:48:31.568 --> 02:48:33.236
IF YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT

02:48:33.303 --> 02:48:34.671
AND ALSO TAKE IT OPPORTUNITY TO

02:48:34.737 --> 02:48:37.140
CLOSE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND

02:48:37.207 --> 02:48:39.742
I APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALL

02:48:39.809 --> 02:48:41.711
OF YOUR ALL OF YOUR COMMENTS.

02:48:41.778 --> 02:48:44.047
CLEARLY, WE STARTED OUT THINKING

02:48:44.113 --> 02:48:46.583
WE WANT TO DO THE MOST THAT WE

02:48:46.649 --> 02:48:48.518
CAN FOR HOUSING TO BE BUILT, AND

02:48:48.585 --> 02:48:50.253
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO PROTECT

02:48:50.320 --> 02:48:52.255
UNDER THE H.R. AND WHAT WE SAW

02:48:52.322 --> 02:48:55.291
WAS AN ABUSE OF THAT AND NOT

02:48:55.358 --> 02:48:57.494
WORKING TOWARDS THE PRIMARY GOAL

02:48:57.560 --> 02:49:00.930
OF BUILDING HOUSING AND TO USE A

02:49:00.997 --> 02:49:03.533
HOTEL, YOU KNOW, THE LEVERAGE OR

02:49:03.600 --> 02:49:05.368
THE EXCUSE THAT, WELL, WE CAN'T

02:49:05.435 --> 02:49:07.203
MAKE IT PENCIL OUT. SO THEREFORE

02:49:07.270 --> 02:49:09.305
YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT THE HOTEL

02:49:09.372 --> 02:49:11.007
TAKING THAT OUT OF THE HANDS OF

02:49:11.074 --> 02:49:13.076
THE LOCAL LOCAL JURISDICTION WAS

02:49:13.142 --> 02:49:17.046
JUST WRONG. SO MAYBE THAT

02:49:17.113 --> 02:49:19.315
CHANGES ARE ARE NEEDED TO THIS

02:49:19.382 --> 02:49:21.284
PARTICULAR BILL. BUT CLEARLY

02:49:21.351 --> 02:49:23.953
WHAT WAS INTENDED BY H.R. WAS TO

02:49:24.020 --> 02:49:26.523
BUILD MORE HOUSING AND TO

02:49:26.589 --> 02:49:28.091
STREAMLINE IT, TO BUILD MORE

02:49:28.157 --> 02:49:29.392
HOUSING. AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT

02:49:29.459 --> 02:49:32.061
TO REMAIN TRUE TO. SO WITH THAT,

02:49:32.128 --> 02:49:33.696
I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR

02:49:33.763 --> 02:49:36.466
VOTE. GREAT. SO WE THANK YOU,

02:49:36.533 --> 02:49:38.201
SENATOR. AND WE HAD A MOTION BY

02:49:38.268 --> 02:49:40.837
MR. KALRA. WE NEED A SECOND,

02:49:40.904 --> 02:49:43.139
SECONDED BY MR. LEE. THANK YOU,

02:49:43.206 --> 02:49:45.108
SENATOR, FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND

02:49:45.174 --> 02:49:47.010
TO THE SPONSORS AND WITNESSES AS

02:49:47.076 --> 02:49:50.213
WELL, AND FOR THE WORK THAT WAS

02:49:50.280 --> 02:49:51.347
DONE ALREADY TO MAKE AMENDMENTS

02:49:51.414 --> 02:49:53.917
AND CONTINUED WORK TO ACCOMPLISH

02:49:53.983 --> 02:49:56.452
WHAT WE KNOW ARE THE GOALS.

02:49:56.519 --> 02:49:57.754
ABSOLUTELY. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:49:57.820 --> 02:50:00.323
THAT THESE HOUSING LAWS, THESE

02:50:00.390 --> 02:50:02.358
STREAMLINING LAWS, LEAD TO MORE

02:50:02.425 --> 02:50:04.027
HOUSING BEING BUILT AND ARE

02:50:04.093 --> 02:50:05.795
FOCUSED ON BUILDING HOUSING.

02:50:05.862 --> 02:50:07.230
THERE IS ALSO, THOUGH, I THINK,

02:50:07.297 --> 02:50:09.198
A REASON WHY WE DO ALLOW FOR

02:50:09.265 --> 02:50:11.200
MIXED USE PROJECTS, AND THAT IS

02:50:11.267 --> 02:50:13.603
ALSO IMPORTANT PART OF IT. BUT I

02:50:13.670 --> 02:50:15.872
WOULD AGREE THAT HOTELS ARE

02:50:15.939 --> 02:50:18.308
DIFFERENT HOTELS, BECAUSE OF

02:50:18.374 --> 02:50:19.375
THEIR SIMILARITY TO HOUSING IN

02:50:19.442 --> 02:50:21.644
VARIOUS WAYS, CAN CAN CROWD OUT

02:50:21.711 --> 02:50:23.413
HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES. THERE CAN

02:50:23.479 --> 02:50:25.949
BE WAYS IN WHICH THESE LAWS ARE

02:50:26.015 --> 02:50:28.518
MISUSED IN THAT WAY. AND FOR THE

02:50:28.585 --> 02:50:29.819
ALL THE REASONS THAT HAVE BEEN

02:50:29.886 --> 02:50:31.921
STATED WHENEVER, WHEREVER

02:50:31.988 --> 02:50:33.656
POSSIBLE, THE HOTEL PORTION

02:50:33.723 --> 02:50:35.091
SHOULD GO THROUGH THE REGULAR

02:50:35.158 --> 02:50:37.327
LOCAL PROCESS AND ALIGN WITH THE

02:50:37.393 --> 02:50:39.529
ZONING. THAT'S WHAT I KNOW THAT

02:50:39.596 --> 02:50:41.998
THE GOAL IS HERE. AND ALL OF OUR

02:50:42.065 --> 02:50:43.600
GOALS, I THINK, ARE SHARED IN

02:50:43.666 --> 02:50:45.201
MAKING SURE WE MAXIMIZE THE

02:50:45.268 --> 02:50:47.437
HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE

02:50:47.503 --> 02:50:48.805
PROVIDED FOR BY THESE LAWS, AND

02:50:48.871 --> 02:50:50.106
APPRECIATE THE CONTINUED WORK

02:50:50.173 --> 02:50:52.542
WITH US ON THOSE ISSUES. SO WE

02:50:52.609 --> 02:50:53.876
HAVE A MOTION IN A SECOND. THIS

02:50:53.943 --> 02:50:55.745
IS DÃ° PASSED TO THE ASSEMBLY
