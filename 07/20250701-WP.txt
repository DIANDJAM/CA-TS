00:44:20.724 --> 00:44:22.159
PLAN TO REFLECT REFLECT THE

00:44:22.226 --> 00:44:24.661
STATE'S NEW CLIMATE REALITY AND

00:44:24.728 --> 00:44:26.797
ESTABLISH LONG TERM WATER SUPPLY

00:44:26.864 --> 00:44:28.632
TARGETS THAT, WHEN MET, WILL

00:44:28.699 --> 00:44:30.768
ENSURE SUFFICIENT HIGH QUALITY

00:44:30.834 --> 00:44:32.536
WATER FOR ALL BENEFICIAL USES IN

00:44:32.603 --> 00:44:34.371
THE STATE AND WILL ENSURE A

00:44:34.438 --> 00:44:36.173
DROUGHT PROOF FUTURE. THAT'S THE

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.375
KEY TO THIS WATER PLAN IS A

00:44:38.442 --> 00:44:40.144
DROUGHT PROOF FUTURE. THE

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:41.478
CALIFORNIA WATER PLAN IS THE

00:44:41.545 --> 00:44:44.114
STATE'S STRATEGIC PLAN FOR

00:44:44.181 --> 00:44:45.115
SUSTAINABLY MANAGING AND

00:44:45.182 --> 00:44:47.518
DEVELOPING WATER RESOURCES FOR

00:44:47.584 --> 00:44:49.086
CURRENT AND FUTURE NEEDS, WHICH

00:44:49.153 --> 00:44:50.954
IS UPDATED EVERY FIVE YEARS AND

00:44:51.021 --> 00:44:52.523
PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO

00:44:52.589 --> 00:44:54.224
INFORM DECISION MAKERS.

00:44:54.291 --> 00:44:55.659
MEANINGFUL REVISIONS TO THE

00:44:55.726 --> 00:44:57.795
WATER PLAN HAVE NOT BEEN MADE

00:44:57.861 --> 00:44:59.196
FOR 20 YEARS, AND DURING THOSE

00:44:59.263 --> 00:45:01.331
20 YEARS, EXTREME WEATHER

00:45:01.398 --> 00:45:02.766
PATTERNS RESULTING FROM CLIMATE

00:45:02.833 --> 00:45:04.802
CHANGE HAS PROFOUNDLY IMPACTED

00:45:04.868 --> 00:45:07.204
WATER SUPPLY IN THE STATE FOR

00:45:07.271 --> 00:45:09.306
VIRTUALLY ALL BENEFICIAL USES.

00:45:09.373 --> 00:45:11.442
SB 72 WOULD SET AN INTERIM

00:45:11.508 --> 00:45:13.544
TARGET OF 9 MILLION ACRE FEET OF

00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:15.813
ADDITIONAL WATER BY 2040, AND

00:45:15.879 --> 00:45:17.181
THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER

00:45:17.247 --> 00:45:19.349
RESOURCES WILL DEVELOP ANY

00:45:19.416 --> 00:45:20.851
FURTHER LONG TERM TARGETS

00:45:20.918 --> 00:45:23.620
NEEDED. RESEARCH SUPPORTS THESE

00:45:23.687 --> 00:45:25.889
TARGETS. AUC RESEARCH STUDIES

00:45:25.956 --> 00:45:27.257
ENTITLED THE MAGNITUDE OF

00:45:27.324 --> 00:45:29.126
CALIFORNIA'S WATER CHALLENGES,

00:45:29.193 --> 00:45:31.228
ESTIMATES A SHORTFALL IN

00:45:31.295 --> 00:45:32.329
CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE. WATER

00:45:32.396 --> 00:45:35.966
SUPPLY. BETWEEN 4.6 AND 9

00:45:36.033 --> 00:45:37.367
MILLION ACRE FEET ANNUALLY. THIS

00:45:37.434 --> 00:45:39.870
EQUATES TO 50 TO 90% OF

00:45:39.937 --> 00:45:44.341
CALIFORNIA'S URBAN WATER USE, OR

00:45:44.408 --> 00:45:45.109
BETWEEN 1.5 AND 3 MILLION ACRES

00:45:45.175 --> 00:45:47.411
OF IRRIGATED FARMLAND. THE

00:45:47.478 --> 00:45:48.846
BOTTOM LINE IS, WITH SIGMA

00:45:48.912 --> 00:45:51.448
COMING, IT IS ESTIMATED THAT IN

00:45:51.515 --> 00:45:53.851
THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE ARE GOING

00:45:53.917 --> 00:45:56.120
TO LOSE BETWEEN 1 MILLION ACRES

00:45:56.186 --> 00:45:57.955
OF AG LAND TO 3 MILLION ACRES OF

00:45:58.021 --> 00:45:59.323
AG LAND, BECAUSE WE WON'T HAVE

00:45:59.389 --> 00:46:02.126
THE WATER NECESSARY TO SUPPORT

00:46:02.192 --> 00:46:03.727
AGRICULTURE IN THAT REGION. THIS

00:46:03.794 --> 00:46:05.762
WILL HAVE AN ABSOLUTE

00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:07.564
DEVASTATING IMPACT ON NOT ONLY

00:46:07.631 --> 00:46:09.666
THE STATE'S ECONOMY, BUT ON OUR

00:46:09.733 --> 00:46:13.003
FOOD SUPPLY. THE RESEARCH ALSO

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:14.071
SUPPORTS A CONCLUSION THAT

00:46:14.138 --> 00:46:15.806
CALIFORNIA MUST PLAN FOR THE

00:46:15.873 --> 00:46:17.674
FUTURE AND UTILIZE ALL OF THE

00:46:17.741 --> 00:46:20.144
TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX. THIS

00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:22.045
INCLUDES INVESTMENT IN

00:46:22.112 --> 00:46:23.780
DESALINATION, RECYCLE AND REUSE

00:46:23.847 --> 00:46:25.916
WATER STORAGE, INCLUDING

00:46:25.983 --> 00:46:27.718
GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AND DEMAND

00:46:27.784 --> 00:46:30.220
MANAGEMENT. A NEW èC STUDY

00:46:30.287 --> 00:46:32.089
ENTITLED INACTIONS ECONOMIC

00:46:32.156 --> 00:46:33.991
COSTS FOR CALIFORNIA'S WATER

00:46:34.057 --> 00:46:36.426
SUPPLY CHALLENGES ESTIMATES

00:46:36.493 --> 00:46:37.794
ESTIMATES THAT WITHOUT BETTER

00:46:37.861 --> 00:46:41.198
MANAGEMENT, CALIFORNIA FACES UP

00:46:41.265 --> 00:46:42.432
TO 14.5 BILLION A YEAR IN

00:46:42.499 --> 00:46:45.736
ECONOMIC LOSS AND 67,000 JOBS

00:46:45.802 --> 00:46:47.804
LOST ANNUALLY. IN ACTION ISN'T

00:46:47.871 --> 00:46:49.773
JUST AN ENVIRONMENTAL RISK. IT

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:51.808
THREATENS CALIFORNIA JOBS,

00:46:51.875 --> 00:46:54.077
MARKET AND ECONOMIC WELL-BEING.

00:46:54.144 --> 00:46:55.379
THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA

00:46:55.445 --> 00:46:56.713
RESIDENTS ALREADY SUFFER FROM

00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:58.916
THE LACK OF CLEAN DRINKING

00:46:58.982 --> 00:46:59.983
WATER, UNABLE TO USE THE WATER

00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:01.752
THAT COMES OUT OF THEIR TAP AND

00:47:01.818 --> 00:47:03.820
FORCED TO BUY BOTTLED WATER. AND

00:47:03.887 --> 00:47:06.957
I HAVE IN FRESNO A BOTTLE OF

00:47:07.024 --> 00:47:09.560
WATER THAT WILL THAT I USE AS A

00:47:09.626 --> 00:47:11.929
TOOL TO TALK ABOUT WATER THAT IS

00:47:11.995 --> 00:47:14.865
BROWN. IT COMPLIES WITH ALL

00:47:14.932 --> 00:47:21.805
STATE TESTING. ANALYZES AS CLEAN

00:47:21.872 --> 00:47:22.906
DRINKING WATER. BUT I VENTURE

00:47:22.973 --> 00:47:24.308
YOU WOULDN'T EVEN WASH YOUR

00:47:24.374 --> 00:47:25.943
CLOTHES IN IT. YOU WOULDN'T GIVE

00:47:26.009 --> 00:47:28.512
IT TO AN ANIMAL TO DRINK. IT'S

00:47:28.579 --> 00:47:30.047
JUST DISGUSTING. SO THE

00:47:30.113 --> 00:47:32.816
CHALLENGE IS WITH US TODAY. AND

00:47:32.883 --> 00:47:35.752
THE LONGER THAT WE DELAY, THE

00:47:35.819 --> 00:47:37.554
HARDER IT WILL BE TO REMEDIATE

00:47:37.621 --> 00:47:40.257
THE PROBLEM. AS OUR POPULATION

00:47:40.324 --> 00:47:41.858
GROWS AMID CLIMATE CHANGE, IT'S

00:47:41.925 --> 00:47:44.494
CRITICAL TO DEVELOP A PLAN AND

00:47:44.561 --> 00:47:46.230
UPDATED APPROACH GUIDED BY STATE

00:47:46.296 --> 00:47:47.197
POLICY MUST BE IMPLEMENTED TO

00:47:47.264 --> 00:47:49.533
MEET THE CHALLENGE OF NAVIGATING

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:50.867
CALIFORNIA'S UNCERTAIN WATER

00:47:50.934 --> 00:47:52.236
FUTURE. IN CLOSING, WITHOUT

00:47:52.302 --> 00:47:54.071
CLEARLY DEFINED WATER SUPPLY

00:47:54.137 --> 00:47:55.872
TARGETS AND STRATEGIC PLANNING,

00:47:55.939 --> 00:47:57.307
THE STATE WILL CONTINUE TO

00:47:57.374 --> 00:47:59.176
EXPERIENCE DEVASTATING WATER

00:47:59.243 --> 00:48:01.745
SHORTAGES WITH DEVASTATING

00:48:01.812 --> 00:48:03.547
CONSEQUENCES. SB 72 IDENTIFIES

00:48:03.614 --> 00:48:06.149
TARGETS TO HELP US AVOID WATER

00:48:06.216 --> 00:48:07.417
SCARCITY AND TO ENSURE A DROUGHT

00:48:07.484 --> 00:48:09.086
PROOF FUTURE. IT'S A LOGICAL

00:48:09.152 --> 00:48:11.488
NEXT STEP. WITH ME TODAY TO

00:48:11.555 --> 00:48:12.823

FUTURE OF MY GRANDCHILDREN. IT'S

00:49:00.203 --> 00:49:03.640
AN AWESOME RESPONSIBILITY. THE

00:49:03.707 --> 00:49:05.142
JOB IS ACTUALLY GETTING A LOT

00:49:05.208 --> 00:49:06.943
HARDER. AND LET ME GIVE YOU A

00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:08.712
REAL WORLD EXAMPLE. THREE YEARS

00:49:08.779 --> 00:49:11.515
AGO, THE STATE WATER PROJECT WAS

00:49:11.581 --> 00:49:14.151
NOT DOING WELL. IN 2019, THE

00:49:14.217 --> 00:49:17.254
SYSTEM WAS FULL OF WATER. BY

00:49:17.321 --> 00:49:19.389
2021, WE HAD A ZERO ALLOCATION

00:49:19.456 --> 00:49:20.924
ON THE STATE WATER PROJECT.

00:49:20.991 --> 00:49:23.727
THAT'S LESS THAN THREE YEARS OF

00:49:23.794 --> 00:49:25.696
RESILIENCY IN THE STATE SYSTEM.

00:49:25.762 --> 00:49:27.097
THAT'S A PRETTY SOBERING

00:49:27.164 --> 00:49:28.231
EXAMPLE. IF YOU'RE A GENERAL

00:49:28.298 --> 00:49:29.733
MANAGER AND YOU'RE CHARGED WITH

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:31.702
SERVING WATER TO A MILLION

00:49:31.768 --> 00:49:33.503
CUSTOMERS, 60% OF MY WATER COMES

00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:35.672
FROM THE STATE WATER PROJECT.

00:49:35.739 --> 00:49:38.709
THAT IS FRIGHTENING. 6 MILLION

00:49:38.775 --> 00:49:40.043
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS WERE

00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:42.145
FORCED TO APPLY FOR HEALTH AND

00:49:42.212 --> 00:49:44.314
SAFETY WATER AT THAT TIME WITH

00:49:44.381 --> 00:49:47.284
DWR, MY AGENCY WAS LITERALLY ONE

00:49:47.351 --> 00:49:48.952
DRY YEAR AWAY FROM CUTTING OFF

00:49:49.019 --> 00:49:50.854
SUPPLY TO SOME MAJOR EMPLOYERS

00:49:50.921 --> 00:49:53.623
IN THE REGION PEPSI, ALBERTSONS,

00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:55.225
JBS MEATS. AND WE'D BE WATCHING

00:49:55.292 --> 00:49:58.095
ALL OF OUR COMMUNITY TURN BROWN,

00:49:58.161 --> 00:50:00.530
OUR LANDSCAPES TURNING BROWN.

00:50:00.597 --> 00:50:02.332
RESEARCH ALSO PROVES WE FACE

00:50:02.399 --> 00:50:05.168
MAJOR WATER SUPPLY GAP. AS A

00:50:05.235 --> 00:50:07.404
SENATOR POINTED OUT, WITH

00:50:07.471 --> 00:50:09.873
POTENTIAL DISASTROUS

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:12.809
RAMIFICATIONS TO THE STATE OF UP

00:50:12.876 --> 00:50:14.144
TO $14.5 BILLION PER YEAR. YOU

00:50:14.211 --> 00:50:15.645
KNOW, WE'RE TRYING TO PUT THIS

00:50:15.712 --> 00:50:16.980
IN TERMS THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND

00:50:17.047 --> 00:50:19.950
WATER SUPPLY IS RELATED TO THE

00:50:20.016 --> 00:50:22.085
ECONOMY OF THIS STATE. THAT'S

00:50:22.152 --> 00:50:23.920
NOT RESILIENCE. THAT'S TAKING ON

00:50:23.987 --> 00:50:26.490
A HUGE RISK IF WE DON'T MOVE

00:50:26.556 --> 00:50:27.958
FORWARD. SB 72 IS THE TURNING

00:50:28.024 --> 00:50:31.795
POINT. IT SETS REAL WORLD GOALS

00:50:31.862 --> 00:50:33.330
AND PLANNING REQUIREMENTS TO

00:50:33.397 --> 00:50:35.499
ENSURE RELIABILITY, NOT JUST FOR

00:50:35.565 --> 00:50:37.868
MY DISTRICT, BUT FOR ALL

00:50:37.934 --> 00:50:38.702
CALIFORNIANS. IT'S NOT ABOUT

00:50:38.769 --> 00:50:39.836
TAKING WATER FROM ONE USE AND

00:50:39.903 --> 00:50:42.606
GIVING IT TO SOMEONE ELSE. IT'S

00:50:42.672 --> 00:50:44.674
DEVELOPING ENOUGH WATER FOR ALL

00:50:44.741 --> 00:50:46.109
USES AND THE WATER IS AVAILABLE.

00:50:46.176 --> 00:50:47.878
MOTHER NATURE IS PROVIDING THE

00:50:47.944 --> 00:50:49.679
WATER. THE PAST THREE YEARS, AN

00:50:49.746 --> 00:50:51.214
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WATER HAS

00:50:51.281 --> 00:50:54.451
BEEN RELEASED TO THE OCEAN. WHY?

00:50:54.518 --> 00:50:55.952
BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T DONE A GOOD

00:50:56.019 --> 00:50:57.654
JOB AS THE WATER INDUSTRY AND

00:50:57.721 --> 00:50:59.356
PLANNING FOR AND CONSTRUCTING

00:50:59.423 --> 00:51:01.191
THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO CAPTURE IT

00:51:01.258 --> 00:51:04.494
AND PUT IT TO BENEFICIAL USE. SB

00:51:04.561 --> 00:51:06.329
72 IS THE FIRST STEP THAT WE

00:51:06.396 --> 00:51:08.532
NEED TO CHANGE THIS MINDSET, GET

00:51:08.598 --> 00:51:11.301
OUT OF A CRISIS MINDSET AND BE

00:51:11.368 --> 00:51:12.836
PLANNERS. WE NEED TO HAVE A

00:51:12.903 --> 00:51:14.938
CLIMATE RESILIENT STRATEGY. IF

00:51:15.005 --> 00:51:16.706
WE WANT TO SUSTAIN THE ECONOMIC

00:51:16.773 --> 00:51:18.508
ENGINE OF THE WORLD'S FOURTH

00:51:18.575 --> 00:51:20.310
LARGEST ECONOMY, PROTECT THE

00:51:20.377 --> 00:51:22.946
HIGH QUALITY OF LIFE FOR OUR

00:51:23.013 --> 00:51:23.847
COMMUNITIES, FOR THE

00:51:23.914 --> 00:51:25.715
ENVIRONMENT, FOR AGRICULTURE, WE

00:51:25.782 --> 00:51:28.785
MUST TAKE DECISIVE ACTION NOW.

00:51:28.852 --> 00:51:30.086
ON BEHALF OF WESTERN WATER, I

00:51:30.153 --> 00:51:32.322
URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. I WANT TO

00:51:32.389 --> 00:51:34.224
THANK THE SENATOR FOR HER HARD

00:51:34.291 --> 00:51:36.526
WORK TO BRING THIS FORWARD. AND

00:51:36.593 --> 00:51:37.627
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MADAM

00:51:37.694 --> 00:51:38.295
CHAIR, MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE.

00:51:38.361 --> 00:51:39.796
MY NAME IS PAUL HELLIKER. I'M

00:51:39.863 --> 00:51:41.198
THE GENERAL MANAGER AT SAN JUAN

00:51:41.264 --> 00:51:42.532
WATER DISTRICT. WE'RE A

00:51:42.599 --> 00:51:43.667
WHOLESALE AND RETAIL SUPPLIER

00:51:43.733 --> 00:51:45.702
HERE IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD UP IN

00:51:45.769 --> 00:51:46.870
THE EASTERN SACRAMENTO COUNTY.

00:51:46.937 --> 00:51:48.138
WESTERN PLACER COUNTY, WE SERVE

00:51:48.205 --> 00:51:50.807
ABOUT 150,000 PEOPLE. WE RELY ON

00:51:50.874 --> 00:51:52.709
FOLSOM RESERVOIR. AND WE'VE SEEN

00:51:52.776 --> 00:51:54.177
FIRSTHAND THAT GLOBAL WARMING IS

00:51:54.244 --> 00:51:55.612
AFFECTING THE OPERATIONS OF

00:51:55.679 --> 00:51:57.948
FOLSOM RESERVOIR. IT'S AFFECTING

00:51:58.014 --> 00:51:59.182
OTHER RESERVOIRS AS WELL

00:51:59.249 --> 00:52:01.451
THROUGHOUT THE STATE. IN 2021,

00:52:01.518 --> 00:52:02.953
WE SAW ALMOST A MILLION ACRE

00:52:03.019 --> 00:52:05.021
FEET OF WATER JUST EVAPORATE

00:52:05.088 --> 00:52:06.723
INTO THE AIR. COULDN'T FIND IT

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:09.559
IN THE SNOWPACK. IT DIDN'T RUN

00:52:09.626 --> 00:52:10.293
DOWN INTO THE RESERVOIRS. SO

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:11.761
THAT WAS THE EXPERIENCE WE HAD

00:52:11.828 --> 00:52:13.396
THAT YEAR. AS CRAIG MENTIONED,

00:52:13.463 --> 00:52:15.765
THE FOLLOWING YEAR, WE HAD A 0%

00:52:15.832 --> 00:52:17.267
ALLOCATION ON THE STATE WATER

00:52:17.334 --> 00:52:18.735
PROJECT. MANY OF THE

00:52:18.802 --> 00:52:19.736
AGRICULTURAL USERS IN THE

00:52:19.803 --> 00:52:21.338
CENTRAL VALLEY ALSO GOT ZERO

00:52:21.404 --> 00:52:22.272
WATER THAT YEAR FROM THE

00:52:22.339 --> 00:52:24.140
SURFACE, AND THEY HAD TO USE

00:52:24.207 --> 00:52:25.876
GROUNDWATER INSTEAD. THEN IN

00:52:25.942 --> 00:52:28.712
2023, WE SAW 700IN OF SNOW OR

00:52:28.778 --> 00:52:31.648
MORE IN THE SIERRA NEVADA. AND

00:52:31.715 --> 00:52:33.783
SO GOVERNOR NEWSOM AND HIS

00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:34.584
ADMINISTRATION THEN STARTED

00:52:34.651 --> 00:52:36.186
USING THE TERM WEATHER WHIPLASH.

00:52:36.253 --> 00:52:37.354
AND THAT'S TRUE. WE'VE

00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:38.555
DEFINITELY SEEN WEATHER

00:52:38.622 --> 00:52:41.124
WHIPLASH. AND IT'S CONTINUING TO

00:52:41.191 --> 00:52:42.859
INCREASE. SO DESPITE THE FACT

00:52:42.926 --> 00:52:44.227
THAT THE GOVERNOR RELEASED HIS

00:52:44.294 --> 00:52:46.329
WATER STRATEGY IN 2022, WHICH

00:52:46.396 --> 00:52:48.865
THIS BILL BUILDS ON, HE

00:52:48.932 --> 00:52:50.600
MENTIONED JUST LAST WEEK THAT

00:52:50.667 --> 00:52:52.836
WE'RE NOT PREPARED. WELL, THE

00:52:52.903 --> 00:52:54.004
SOLUTION, THE WAY TO PREPARE FOR

00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:57.140
THIS IS SB 72. IT WILL IT WILL

00:52:57.207 --> 00:52:59.476
SET A STATEWIDE TARGET, BUT ALSO

00:52:59.543 --> 00:53:01.011
MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT WILL SET UP

00:53:01.077 --> 00:53:02.979
A STRATEGIC PLAN TO MEET THAT

00:53:03.046 --> 00:53:04.881
TARGET. SO WE SUPPORT IT. WE

00:53:04.948 --> 00:53:06.483

ACP CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. I'M

00:57:09.492 --> 00:57:11.494
SURE THERE WAS SOME SEGMENT OF

00:57:11.561 --> 00:57:12.262
CALIFORNIA THAT WASN'T COVERED,

00:57:12.328 --> 00:57:16.299
BUT I COULDN'T. DO WE HAVE ANY

00:57:16.366 --> 00:57:31.881
WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION?

00:57:31.948 --> 00:57:35.418
MORNING. DENNIS O'CONNOR WITH

00:57:35.485 --> 00:57:38.321
THE MONO LAKE COMMITTEE. WE HAVE

00:57:38.388 --> 00:57:40.957
STILL TWO MAIN OBJECTIONS TO

00:57:41.024 --> 00:57:44.828
THIS BILL. FIRST, WE SEE IT AS

00:57:44.894 --> 00:57:46.963
ACTUALLY GOING BACKWARDS. I

00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:48.731
FIRST GOT INVOLVED IN THE WATER

00:57:48.798 --> 00:57:51.901
PLAN PROCESS BACK IN 1998, WHERE

00:57:51.968 --> 00:57:53.870
THE PROCESS WAS, THEY WOULD

00:57:53.937 --> 00:57:56.406
FORECAST HOW MUCH WATER DEMAND

00:57:56.472 --> 00:57:57.841
THERE WAS GOING TO BE. THEY

00:57:57.907 --> 00:57:59.442
WOULD FORECAST HOW MUCH WATER

00:57:59.509 --> 00:58:01.277
WAS AVAILABLE UNDER CURRENT

00:58:01.344 --> 00:58:02.879
OPERATIONS, AND WOULD THEN COME

00:58:02.946 --> 00:58:05.448
UP WITH A PLAN TO FILL THAT GAP.

00:58:05.515 --> 00:58:06.883
THE PROBLEM IS, IS THAT THERE'S

00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:08.618
A LOT MORE TO HAVING AN

00:58:08.685 --> 00:58:11.154
EFFICIENT WATER SYSTEM THAN JUST

00:58:11.221 --> 00:58:14.591
WATER. FOR EXAMPLE, THE SENATOR

00:58:14.657 --> 00:58:16.826
TALKED ABOUT THE, THE, THE WATER

00:58:16.893 --> 00:58:18.895
THAT IN HER BOTTLE THAT THAT'S

00:58:18.962 --> 00:58:20.763
DARK AND PEOPLE WON'T DRINK IT.

00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:22.599
IT DOESN'T DO YOU ANY GOOD TO

00:58:22.665 --> 00:58:24.601
HAVE WATER IF YOU CAN'T DRINK IT

00:58:24.667 --> 00:58:27.203
OR IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD IT. WHICH

00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:29.772
LEADS TO OUR SECOND ISSUE. WE'RE

00:58:29.839 --> 00:58:33.176
VERY MUCH CONCERNED THAT THE 9

00:58:33.243 --> 00:58:36.279
MILLION ACRE FEET ESTIMATE OR

00:58:36.346 --> 00:58:38.815
TARGET IN THIS BILL IS TOO HIGH.

00:58:38.882 --> 00:58:41.718
THE CONSEQUENCES OF HAVING TOO

00:58:41.784 --> 00:58:45.655
MUCH TO OF OVER PROJECTING YOUR

00:58:45.722 --> 00:58:48.258
WATER DEMAND IS THAT YOU WILL

00:58:48.324 --> 00:58:49.225
TEND TO OVERBUILD OR OVERINVEST

00:58:49.292 --> 00:58:51.394
IN YOUR WATER SYSTEM, WHICH

00:58:51.461 --> 00:58:53.463
MAKES WATER MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE.

00:58:53.529 --> 00:58:54.864
WE'RE SEEING THIS PROBLEM

00:58:54.931 --> 00:58:56.466
ALREADY DOWN IN SAN DIEGO

00:58:56.532 --> 00:58:59.035
COUNTY, AND IT'S QUITE LIKELY TO

00:58:59.102 --> 00:59:00.436
START HAPPENING IN OTHER

00:59:00.503 --> 00:59:02.438
COUNTIES AS WELL. FOR ALL

00:59:02.505 --> 00:59:04.741
INTENTS AND PURPOSES, ALL OF

00:59:04.807 --> 00:59:05.975
CALIFORNIA'S RIVERS AND STREAMS

00:59:06.042 --> 00:59:08.678
ARE EITHER FULLY OR OVER

00:59:08.745 --> 00:59:10.880
APPROPRIATED TO ACCOMMODATE

00:59:10.947 --> 00:59:13.683
THIS. THE TARGETS IN THIS BILL,

00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:15.585
IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO COME FROM

00:59:15.652 --> 00:59:18.554
SOMEPLACE. WE'RE ALREADY HAVING

00:59:18.621 --> 00:59:20.089
PROBLEMS ESTABLISHING MINIMUM

00:59:20.156 --> 00:59:23.159
INSTREAM FLOWS TO SUPPORT OUR

00:59:23.226 --> 00:59:26.029
ECOSYSTEM. AND THIS BILL IS

00:59:26.095 --> 00:59:27.196
LIKELY TO MAKE THAT EVEN MORE

00:59:27.263 --> 00:59:29.599
CHALLENGING. THANK YOU. THANK

00:59:29.666 --> 00:59:32.235
YOU VERY MUCH. ANY WITNESSES IN

00:59:32.302 --> 00:59:34.938
THE AUDIENCE? IN OPPOSITION?

00:59:35.004 --> 00:59:37.807
JUST A FEW. NOT WITNESSES. BUT

00:59:37.874 --> 00:59:40.877
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEANT. NATALIE

00:59:40.944 --> 00:59:42.445

00:59:53.823 --> 00:59:54.891
THAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE'LL

00:59:54.958 --> 00:59:57.493
BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE.

00:59:57.560 --> 00:59:57.927
QUESTIONS. COMMENTS.

00:59:57.994 --> 00:59:59.662
ASSEMBLYMEMBER ROGERS, THANK YOU

00:59:59.729 --> 01:00:01.364
SO MUCH, CHAIR. AND THANK YOU,

01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:02.632
SENATOR, FOR BRINGING THE BILL.

01:00:02.699 --> 01:00:04.801
I DID HAVE A QUESTION THAT WAS

01:00:04.867 --> 01:00:06.369
RELATED TO THE 9 MILLION ACRE

01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:08.137
FEET, AS WAS MENTIONED IN THE

01:00:08.204 --> 01:00:09.806
TESTIMONY, AND THE GOVERNOR'S

01:00:09.872 --> 01:00:12.175
2022 STRATEGY. THE TARGET WAS

01:00:12.241 --> 01:00:14.944
SET AT 7 MILLION ACRE FEET. AND

01:00:15.011 --> 01:00:16.612
THEN YOU SUBSEQUENTLY BROUGHT A

01:00:16.679 --> 01:00:17.981
BILL IN 2023 THAT WAS VETOED.

01:00:18.047 --> 01:00:20.583
HERE WE ARE TWO YEARS LATER. SO

01:00:20.650 --> 01:00:21.184
KIND OF TWO QUESTIONS. ONE,

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:23.186
WHERE IS THAT 9 MILLION ACRE

01:00:23.252 --> 01:00:24.454
FEET TARGET COMING FROM? WHAT'S

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:26.089
THE SCIENCE BEHIND IT? AND THEN

01:00:26.155 --> 01:00:28.124
TWO, GIVEN THE GOVERNOR'S

01:00:28.191 --> 01:00:30.893
PREVIOUS VETO, WHY DO YOU THINK

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:32.328
THINGS WILL BE DIFFERENT WITH

01:00:32.395 --> 01:00:35.164
THIS BILL? SO LET ME ANSWER THE

01:00:35.231 --> 01:00:37.433
LAST QUESTION FIRST. WHO KNOWS?

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.402
I MEAN, I REALLY HAVE TO I'M

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:41.838
BEING A LITTLE FACETIOUS, BUT

01:00:41.904 --> 01:00:43.806
THE CHALLENGE, I THINK, IN TERMS

01:00:43.873 --> 01:00:45.074
OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE

01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:47.010
THE GOVERNOR IS COMING FROM IS

01:00:47.076 --> 01:00:50.179
BECAUSE WATER BILLS THAT I'VE

01:00:50.246 --> 01:00:52.482
BEEN ABLE TO PUT ON HIS DESK

01:00:52.548 --> 01:00:55.718
THAT GIVE US INFORMATION END UP

01:00:55.785 --> 01:00:58.821
GETTING VETOED BECAUSE OF COST.

01:00:58.888 --> 01:01:03.893
AND IN IN AS AN EXAMPLE. AND

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:05.661
I'LL DRAW OUR ATTENTION TO THE

01:01:05.728 --> 01:01:07.730
YEAR THAT THERE WAS SNOW UP IN

01:01:07.797 --> 01:01:10.033
THE MOUNTAINS. AND THEN BY THE

01:01:10.099 --> 01:01:11.934
TIME THAT THAT SNOW STARTED TO

01:01:12.001 --> 01:01:13.369
MELT, IT DISSIPATED. IT DIDN'T

01:01:13.436 --> 01:01:16.939
DO ANYTHING FOR THE RIVERS. AND

01:01:17.006 --> 01:01:19.108
I AND I WANT TO CALL THE

01:01:19.175 --> 01:01:20.109
ATTENTION TO TURLOCK IRRIGATION

01:01:20.176 --> 01:01:21.911
DISTRICT. THEY ARE VERY FORWARD

01:01:21.978 --> 01:01:24.680
THINKING AND THEY HAVE MADE SOME

01:01:24.747 --> 01:01:27.216
EXPENDITURES TO KNOW WITH

01:01:27.283 --> 01:01:30.186
PRECISION WHAT RESOURCES ARE

01:01:30.253 --> 01:01:32.722
COMING FROM SNOWMELT FOR THEIR

01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:36.225
SYSTEM, BECAUSE IF THEY MAKE A

01:01:36.292 --> 01:01:37.060
MISCALCULATION, THEN THEY DON'T

01:01:37.126 --> 01:01:38.494
HAVE IT. THEY'RE THEY'RE IN

01:01:38.561 --> 01:01:40.263
TROUBLE BECAUSE THEY RUN AN

01:01:40.329 --> 01:01:41.664
ENERGY SYSTEM AND A WATER

01:01:41.731 --> 01:01:43.199
SYSTEM, AND YOU NEED THE WATER

01:01:43.266 --> 01:01:45.601
FOR THE ENERGY. AND WHAT THEY

01:01:45.668 --> 01:01:47.270
DID IS THEY USED LIDAR

01:01:47.336 --> 01:01:49.772
TECHNOLOGY TO GO UP AND, AND DO

01:01:49.839 --> 01:01:52.175
A COUPLE OF RUNS OVER THE SNOW

01:01:52.241 --> 01:01:54.677
MELT, AND THAT'S HOW THEY

01:01:54.744 --> 01:01:56.446
REPURPOSED THEIR DAMS. SO WHEN

01:01:56.512 --> 01:01:58.648
WE TALK ABOUT ADDITIONAL ACRE

01:01:58.714 --> 01:02:01.084
FEET, IT DOESN'T ALL HAVE TO BE

01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:08.925
IN THE RIVERS AS WAS. ALLEGED.

01:02:08.991 --> 01:02:11.160
I'M NOT LOOKING TO GET MORE

01:02:11.227 --> 01:02:12.962
WATER TO STARVE FISH OUT OF THE

01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:15.098
RIVERS. I'M LOOKING TO GET MORE

01:02:15.164 --> 01:02:16.999
WATER SO THAT PEOPLE HAVE IT AND

01:02:17.066 --> 01:02:18.334
THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY HAVE IT

01:02:18.401 --> 01:02:20.903
WHEN THEY NEED IT DURING THE

01:02:20.970 --> 01:02:24.173
DROUGHTS. SO THE QUESTION IN

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:25.608
REGARDS TO THE GOVERNOR, I'M

01:02:25.675 --> 01:02:27.643
HOPING THAT AT SOME POINT

01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:32.482
THERE'S A RECOGNITION THAT THAT

01:02:32.548 --> 01:02:35.017
WHEN WE DO WATER BONDS, THE

01:02:35.084 --> 01:02:37.120
QUESTION AND I, I'VE BEEN

01:02:37.186 --> 01:02:38.588
INTIMATELY INVOLVED IN WORKING

01:02:38.654 --> 01:02:41.858
ON WATER BONDS. YOU NEED TO KNOW

01:02:41.924 --> 01:02:43.359
WHAT'S THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:44.894
PLACE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO

01:02:44.961 --> 01:02:46.729
MOVE WATER FROM ONE AREA THAT

01:02:46.796 --> 01:02:49.732
MAY HAVE WATER TO ANOTHER AREA,

01:02:49.799 --> 01:02:51.534
OR THAT MAY BE USING RECYCLED

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:53.336
WATER AND CAN BE USED ON

01:02:53.402 --> 01:02:54.704
AGRICULTURE IN A WAY THAT'S

01:02:54.770 --> 01:02:56.672
DIFFERENT THAN POTABLE, POTABLE

01:02:56.739 --> 01:02:58.708
AT A POTABLE LEVEL. IN OTHER

01:02:58.774 --> 01:03:01.244
WORDS, WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE

01:03:01.310 --> 01:03:03.045
WE'RE WE NEED TO GO WITH THE

01:03:03.112 --> 01:03:04.113
INFRASTRUCTURE IN ORDER TO BE

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:06.682
ABLE TO PLAN THIS. WE WOULD HAVE

01:03:06.749 --> 01:03:08.084
KNOWN THAT THAT SNOWMELT WAS NOT

01:03:08.151 --> 01:03:09.919
WORTH ANYTHING HAD WE DONE THE

01:03:09.986 --> 01:03:11.988
LIDAR TECHNOLOGY, BUT INSTEAD,

01:03:12.054 --> 01:03:14.657
BECAUSE IT WAS A 9 OR $10

01:03:14.724 --> 01:03:16.459
MILLION PRICE TAG, THE AT A TIME

01:03:16.526 --> 01:03:18.094
WHEN WE HAD SIGNIFICANT

01:03:18.161 --> 01:03:20.329
RESOURCES, IT WAS VETOED. IT'S

01:03:20.396 --> 01:03:24.534
MY HOPE THAT THAT IN THE FINAL

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:27.837
YEAR OF HIS GOVERNORSHIP THAT

01:03:27.904 --> 01:03:31.474
GOVERNOR BROWN, GOVERNOR NEWSOM

01:03:31.541 --> 01:03:32.208
RECOGNIZES THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:03:32.275 --> 01:03:34.410
NEED SOME NEW TOOLS IN THE

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:36.179
TOOLBOX, AND THE PUBLIC SUPPORTS

01:03:36.245 --> 01:03:38.080
WATER BONDS FAIRLY

01:03:38.147 --> 01:03:38.681
SIGNIFICANTLY. WE'RE GOING TO

01:03:38.748 --> 01:03:40.883
NEED TO DO ANOTHER WATER BOND IN

01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:42.585
THE NEAR FUTURE. AND IF WE HAVE

01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:44.053
THE PLAN, THAT'S GOING TO BE

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:45.188
REALLY IMPORTANT. SO THAT'S

01:03:45.254 --> 01:03:47.223
THAT'S TO THE SECOND QUESTION.

01:03:47.290 --> 01:03:49.759
THE FIRST QUESTION, HOW DID YOU

01:03:49.825 --> 01:03:51.294
COME UP WITH THE 9 MILLION ACRE

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:54.530
FEET. YES. SO THE FIRST YEAR WE

01:03:54.597 --> 01:03:57.066
THERE WERE A NUMBER OF STUDIES

01:03:57.133 --> 01:04:00.403
OUT THAT ESTIMATED UP UP TO

01:04:00.469 --> 01:04:02.872
ABOUT NINE $9 MILLION. BUT WHAT

01:04:02.939 --> 01:04:04.674
WE ENDED UP DOING IS WE

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:06.475
COMMISSIONED A STUDY THAT TOOK A

01:04:06.542 --> 01:04:08.010
LOOK AT ALL THE WATER NEEDS IN

01:04:08.077 --> 01:04:09.912
THE STATE AND THE NUMBER THAT

01:04:09.979 --> 01:04:12.148
THEY LANDED ON, LOOKING AT ALL

01:04:12.215 --> 01:04:14.250
THE STUDIES THAT KIND OF PEER

01:04:14.317 --> 01:04:15.818
REVIEWING EVERYTHING, THAT THE

01:04:15.885 --> 01:04:18.621
NUMBER WAS 9 MILLION ACRE FEET.

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:20.990
AND SO THAT WE'VE GONE WITH THAT

01:04:21.057 --> 01:04:23.392
NUMBER AGAIN, BECAUSE INITIALLY,

01:04:23.459 --> 01:04:24.961
IF YOU LOOK BACK AT THE ORIGINAL

01:04:25.027 --> 01:04:26.963
BILL THAT I DID, I HAD 15

01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:28.698
MILLION ACRES OR 10 MILLION ACRE

01:04:28.764 --> 01:04:29.999
FEET, AND THEN IT WAS 15 MILLION

01:04:30.066 --> 01:04:34.470
ACRE FEET BY 2050. AND WE GOT

01:04:34.537 --> 01:04:37.673
RID OF THAT AS, AS TOO FAR OUT

01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:40.142
TO MAKE AN ANALYSIS. AND WE

01:04:40.209 --> 01:04:41.978
STUCK WITH THE 9 MILLION BASED

01:04:42.044 --> 01:04:44.680
ON WHAT, WHAT CAME OUT OF OUR

01:04:44.747 --> 01:04:46.315
STUDY AS WELL. OKAY. SO YOUR

01:04:46.382 --> 01:04:47.717
STUDY, WHICH WAS DONE JUST A

01:04:47.783 --> 01:04:49.719
YEAR OR SO LATER. YES. THAN THE

01:04:49.785 --> 01:04:51.854
GOVERNOR'S WAS OFF BY 2 MILLION

01:04:51.921 --> 01:04:53.356
FROM WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S STUDY

01:04:53.422 --> 01:04:55.891
DID. CORRECT? OKAY. YEAH. YOU

01:04:55.958 --> 01:04:58.561
MENTIONED FISH MINIMUM FLOWS.

01:04:58.628 --> 01:05:00.363
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME IN

01:05:00.429 --> 01:05:01.864
MY DISTRICT. ME TOO.

01:05:01.931 --> 01:05:02.932
PARTICULARLY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

01:05:02.999 --> 01:05:04.634
THINGS LIKE THE KLAMATH. HOW DID

01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:09.005
YOU ACCOUNT FOR LOCAL ECOLOGY IN

01:05:09.071 --> 01:05:11.240
THAT PROCESS OR HOW WILL YOU, IF

01:05:11.307 --> 01:05:12.842
THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD AND YOU

01:05:12.908 --> 01:05:14.143
HAVE THIS PROCESS THAT YOU'RE

01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:15.878
THIS PLANNING PROCESS, HOW ARE

01:05:15.945 --> 01:05:17.046
YOU GOING TO ACCOUNT FOR THE

01:05:17.113 --> 01:05:18.814
NEEDS OF FISH AND THE LOCAL

01:05:18.881 --> 01:05:20.283
ECOLOGY IN THOSE STREAMS? SO

01:05:20.349 --> 01:05:23.419
THIS BILL DOES NOT DESIGNATE HOW

01:05:23.486 --> 01:05:25.955
OR WHERE THAT RESOURCE IS GOING

01:05:26.022 --> 01:05:27.290
TO COME FROM. IN OTHER WORDS, IT

01:05:27.356 --> 01:05:29.859
IS IT. IT IS A PLAN THAT TAKES

01:05:29.925 --> 01:05:31.694
INTO CONSIDERATION ALL OF THE

01:05:31.761 --> 01:05:34.563
NEEDS IN THE STATE AND DOESN'T

01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:37.466
PICK WINNERS OR LOSERS IN TERMS

01:05:37.533 --> 01:05:40.369
OF ADJUSTING FLOWS OR MAKING

01:05:40.436 --> 01:05:42.505
WHAT IT IS IT'S A RECOGNITION

01:05:42.571 --> 01:05:44.674
THAT WE HAVE ALL OF THESE NEEDS

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:46.609
IN THE STATE AND THAT IF WE'RE

01:05:46.676 --> 01:05:49.111
GOING TO MEET THE FUTURE NEEDS,

01:05:49.178 --> 01:05:50.012
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO

01:05:50.079 --> 01:05:52.214
SOMETHING DIFFERENT. LET ME JUST

01:05:52.281 --> 01:05:53.649
SAY THAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST

01:05:53.716 --> 01:05:56.619
CHALLENGES I THINK WE'RE GOING

01:05:56.686 --> 01:06:02.458
TO HAVE TO THE. THE ABILITY TO

01:06:02.525 --> 01:06:05.227
OPERATE IN IN A WAY THAT

01:06:05.294 --> 01:06:07.596
PROTECTS FISH UP IN YOUR AREA,

01:06:07.663 --> 01:06:09.565
YOU GET A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

01:06:09.632 --> 01:06:11.734
RAINFALL. BUT IN MY AREA, WE

01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:12.902
DEPEND, WHICH IS A CENTRAL

01:06:12.968 --> 01:06:14.503
VALLEY, WE DEPEND ON SNOWMELT.

01:06:14.570 --> 01:06:15.871
AND IF WE DON'T HAVE SNOWMELT,

01:06:15.938 --> 01:06:17.473
WE'RE GOING TO RUN INTO ISSUES.

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:18.841
AND THAT'S PART OF WHAT'S

01:06:18.908 --> 01:06:20.009
HAPPENED ALREADY, IS THAT THE

01:06:20.076 --> 01:06:23.212
SNOW MELT IS SUCH THAT IT IT IS

01:06:23.279 --> 01:06:24.447
NONEXISTENT IN DROUGHT YEARS.

01:06:24.513 --> 01:06:26.082
AND IN THOSE DROUGHT YEARS, YOU

01:06:26.148 --> 01:06:27.583
DON'T HAVE THE WATER TEMPERATURE

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:31.020
OR THE WATER TURBIDITY THAT'S

01:06:31.087 --> 01:06:34.056
REQUIRED TO BE ABLE TO, TO

01:06:34.123 --> 01:06:36.525
SUSTAIN THE FISH LIFE THAT THAT

01:06:36.592 --> 01:06:38.060
THAT TRAVELS UPRIVER AND SPAWNS

01:06:38.127 --> 01:06:39.695
AND THEN COMES BACK DOWN. IT'S A

01:06:39.762 --> 01:06:41.731
IT'S A PROBLEM. WE'VE GOT TO

01:06:41.797 --> 01:06:42.898
FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO

01:06:42.965 --> 01:06:44.767
DEAL WITH, BECAUSE IT'S

01:06:44.834 --> 01:06:46.202
PREDICTED THAT BY 2040 WE WILL

01:06:46.268 --> 01:06:49.138
HAVE NO MORE SNOWMELT. THAT'S

01:06:49.205 --> 01:06:51.374
DEVASTATING. YEAH. I MEAN, I

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:52.775
THINK YOU'RE HITTING IT ON THE

01:06:52.842 --> 01:06:54.744
HEAD, TOO, THAT IT'S NOT EVEN A

01:06:54.810 --> 01:06:56.278
QUESTION OF HOW MUCH WATER. IT'S

01:06:56.345 --> 01:06:59.181
ALSO A QUESTION OF WHEN. AND WE

01:06:59.248 --> 01:06:59.749
OBVIOUSLY WE SEE THAT WITH

01:06:59.815 --> 01:07:00.349
MANAGING FISH POPULATIONS AND

01:07:00.416 --> 01:07:01.784
WHEN THEY NEED THAT MINIMUM

01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:03.185
FLOWS AND THOSE STREAMS THAT

01:07:03.252 --> 01:07:05.921
FRANKLY FOR TEMPERATURE CONTROL

01:07:05.988 --> 01:07:08.858
AS WELL. COULD I ADD AS A

01:07:08.924 --> 01:07:10.326
FOOTNOTE THAT WHAT PART OF WHAT

01:07:10.393 --> 01:07:13.629
I THINK IS OUR OPPORTUNITY IS TO

01:07:13.696 --> 01:07:16.232
USE TECHNOLOGY TO GIVE US

01:07:16.298 --> 01:07:18.300
INFORMATION? AND I HAVE A BILL

01:07:18.367 --> 01:07:20.436
THAT'S ON CONSENT TODAY, AND

01:07:20.503 --> 01:07:22.638
THAT DEALS WITH ATMOSPHERIC

01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:26.442
RIVERS AND THE THERE IS MODELING

01:07:26.509 --> 01:07:28.778
THAT'S BEING DONE AS WE SPEAK

01:07:28.844 --> 01:07:31.247
THAT THAT CAN TELL US WHEN THOSE

01:07:31.313 --> 01:07:33.149
ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS ARE LIKELY TO

01:07:33.215 --> 01:07:35.918
HIT THE, OUR, OUR SHORES, HOW

01:07:35.985 --> 01:07:38.921
MUCH WATER THEY THERE WHEN

01:07:38.988 --> 01:07:40.823
THEY'RE GOING TO HIT, HOW ACTIVE

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:42.858
THEY ARE. SO WILL THEY MOVE

01:07:42.925 --> 01:07:43.959
THROUGH OR WILL THEY STAY FOR A

01:07:44.026 --> 01:07:45.928
WHILE? AND HOW MUCH WATER ARE

01:07:45.995 --> 01:07:47.396
THEY GOING TO DROP? THE REASON

01:07:47.463 --> 01:07:48.564
THIS BECOMES IMPORTANT IN MY

01:07:48.631 --> 01:07:51.033
DISTRICT IS BECAUSE WE HAD

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:52.835
SIGNIFICANT FLOODING THE LAST

01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:56.505
THE LAST WET YEAR. AND THE

01:07:56.572 --> 01:07:57.873
CHALLENGE WAS, IS ALL THAT

01:07:57.940 --> 01:07:59.141
WATER? IF WE COULD HAVE SAVED

01:07:59.208 --> 01:08:00.876
IT, IF WE COULD HAVE CAPTURED

01:08:00.943 --> 01:08:02.978
IT, SET UP THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO

01:08:03.045 --> 01:08:05.314
SAVE IT, PUT IT ON AG LAND, WE

01:08:05.381 --> 01:08:07.216
COULD GET IT UNDERGROUND FAIRLY,

01:08:07.283 --> 01:08:10.419
FAIRLY ECONOMICALLY, BUT WE HAVE

01:08:10.486 --> 01:08:12.755
FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED HOW WE DO

01:08:12.822 --> 01:08:13.689
AGRICULTURE. IT'S DRIP

01:08:13.756 --> 01:08:15.491
IRRIGATION NOW, SO ALL THE WEIRS

01:08:15.558 --> 01:08:16.859
AND THE GATES AND EVERYTHING

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:18.727
THAT USED TO BE IN PLACE HAVE

01:08:18.794 --> 01:08:20.996
BEEN TAKEN OUT. WE NEED THAT

01:08:21.063 --> 01:08:22.765
DATA TO BE ABLE TO TELL US WHERE

01:08:22.832 --> 01:08:24.266
SHOULD WE PUT THAT BACK IN

01:08:24.333 --> 01:08:26.735
AGAIN? ONE SO THAT WE DON'T

01:08:26.802 --> 01:08:28.137
FLOOD, AND TWO, SO THAT WHEN THE

01:08:28.204 --> 01:08:29.572
WATER COMES, WE'RE ABLE TO

01:08:29.638 --> 01:08:31.307
DIVERT IT IN A WAY THAT THAT

01:08:31.373 --> 01:08:32.975
CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO

01:08:33.042 --> 01:08:34.910
STORE IT. AND SO IT'S, IT'S A

01:08:34.977 --> 01:08:36.312
IT'S A WHOLE SERIES OF THINGS

01:08:36.378 --> 01:08:38.147
THAT I THINK WE NEED TO PREPARE

01:08:38.214 --> 01:08:40.382
FOR IN ORDER FOR US TO BE WISE

01:08:40.449 --> 01:08:42.585
STEWARDS OF A REALLY LIMITED,

01:08:42.651 --> 01:08:44.653
PRECIOUS RESOURCE. YEAH. WELL,

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:45.988
I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL

01:08:46.055 --> 01:08:50.092
TODAY. I DO NOTE THAT THERE'S AN

01:08:50.159 --> 01:08:51.160
ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT ALREADY

01:08:51.227 --> 01:08:53.295
HAD INTERESTS LIKE AGRICULTURE

01:08:53.362 --> 01:08:55.598
AND BUSINESS. YOU WERE ADDING IN

01:08:55.664 --> 01:08:57.266
A COUPLE OF, I THINK, GOOD

01:08:57.333 --> 01:08:58.501
ADDITIONAL REPRESENTATIVES LIKE

01:08:58.567 --> 01:09:00.603
TRIBAL COMMUNITIES AND LABOR

01:09:00.669 --> 01:09:02.171
REPRESENTATIVES. I JUST ASK THAT

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:03.072
YOU ALSO CONSIDER PERHAPS

01:09:03.138 --> 01:09:04.240
PUTTING IN A SPOT FOR THE

01:09:04.306 --> 01:09:06.308
FISHING COMMUNITY SO THAT

01:09:06.375 --> 01:09:07.776
ESPECIALLY AS YOU HAVE THESE

01:09:07.843 --> 01:09:09.245
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT REGIONAL

01:09:09.311 --> 01:09:10.746
DIFFERENCES, YOU'RE RIGHT. MY

01:09:10.813 --> 01:09:12.815
DISTRICT GETS A LOT MORE WATER

01:09:12.882 --> 01:09:14.350
THAN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE,

01:09:14.416 --> 01:09:15.818
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THOSE

01:09:15.885 --> 01:09:17.119
FOLKS SHOULDN'T HAVE A VOICE IN

01:09:17.186 --> 01:09:19.622
HOW THIS IS BEING PLAYED OUT. SO

01:09:19.688 --> 01:09:21.457
WITH THAT, I APPRECIATE IT.

01:09:21.524 --> 01:09:26.095
THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER. I

01:09:26.161 --> 01:09:28.464
JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE I TOOK

01:09:28.531 --> 01:09:29.832
A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE

01:09:29.899 --> 01:09:31.500
SENATOR. YOU HAVE ALWAYS

01:09:31.567 --> 01:09:32.701
PRIORITIZED THE CENTRAL VALLEY.

01:09:32.768 --> 01:09:34.403
YOU HAVE ALWAYS LOOKED AT WATER.

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:36.839
I EVEN MIMICKED ONE OF MY BILLS

01:09:36.906 --> 01:09:38.807
THAT UNFORTUNATELY DIED AFTER

01:09:38.874 --> 01:09:40.910
ONE OF YOURS. BECAUSE YOUR

01:09:40.976 --> 01:09:42.011
DEDICATION AND WHAT YOU'VE SEEN,

01:09:42.077 --> 01:09:44.179
AND SOMETHING THAT WE ALL TALK

01:09:44.246 --> 01:09:45.281
ABOUT, ESPECIALLY IN THE VALLEY,

01:09:45.347 --> 01:09:46.549
IS WHERE WATER FLOWS, LIFE

01:09:46.615 --> 01:09:49.919
GROWS. AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK

01:09:49.985 --> 01:09:51.720
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF YOUR

01:09:51.787 --> 01:09:52.855
PRIORITIES HERE IN THIS BILL. DO

01:09:52.922 --> 01:09:55.190
FOCUS ON JUST CREATING A FULL

01:09:55.257 --> 01:09:56.325
LONG TERM PLAN AND MAKING THE

01:09:56.392 --> 01:09:57.493
ADJUSTMENTS NECESSARY THAT WE

01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:59.261
NEED. AND I MEAN, I THINK ABOUT

01:09:59.328 --> 01:10:01.797
THE ADDITIONAL $9 MILLION OR 9

01:10:01.864 --> 01:10:03.632
MILLION ACRE FEET THAT WE NEED.

01:10:03.699 --> 01:10:05.467
IF WE THINK ABOUT IT, THIS YEAR

01:10:05.534 --> 01:10:08.237
ALONE, WE'RE ABOUT 117%, 119%

01:10:08.304 --> 01:10:09.305
WATERFALL THAT HAPPENED THIS

01:10:09.371 --> 01:10:11.473
YEAR. THAT WOULD MEAN ON

01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:13.409
AVERAGE, CALIFORNIA IS AT 200

01:10:13.475 --> 01:10:15.144
MILLION ACRE FEET. WE HAD 34

01:10:15.210 --> 01:10:16.245
MILLION ACRE FEET OF WATER FALL

01:10:16.312 --> 01:10:18.047
IN THIS STATE. HOW DO WE STORE?

01:10:18.113 --> 01:10:19.882
HOW DO WE CAPTURE IT? WE COULD

01:10:19.949 --> 01:10:21.850
FIND THE 9 MILLION ACRE FEET

01:10:21.917 --> 01:10:22.685
RIGHT THERE PRETTY EASILY. SAME

01:10:22.751 --> 01:10:24.520
THING FOR HAPPENED IN 2023, AND

01:10:24.587 --> 01:10:25.454
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE START LONG

01:10:25.521 --> 01:10:27.356
TERM PLANNING ON THE 40 YEAR WET

01:10:27.423 --> 01:10:28.857
CYCLE THAT WE HAVE HERE IN

01:10:28.924 --> 01:10:30.259
CALIFORNIA. I THINK THAT YOU SEE

01:10:30.326 --> 01:10:32.061
THAT YOU FACTORED IN A LOT, BUT

01:10:32.127 --> 01:10:34.129
YOU ALSO BRING IN, AGAIN, AND I

01:10:34.196 --> 01:10:35.297
JOIN MY COLLEAGUE, A LOT OF THE

01:10:35.364 --> 01:10:38.500
OTHER ADDITIONAL GROUPS, TRIBES,

01:10:38.567 --> 01:10:41.370
TO HAVE A SAY IN IN THIS. SO I

01:10:41.437 --> 01:10:42.905
THINK IT'S A FULL COMPREHENSIVE

01:10:42.972 --> 01:10:44.673
PLAN. AND I ALSO JUST WANTED TO

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:46.008
MAKE SURE I WAS SAYING THANK YOU

01:10:46.075 --> 01:10:47.009
ALWAYS FOR YOUR DEDICATION TO

01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:48.978
THE CENTRAL VALLEY, AND I ALWAYS

01:10:49.044 --> 01:10:50.079
WISH YOU GOOD LUCK IN FUTURE

01:10:50.145 --> 01:10:52.081
ENDEAVORS AS WELL. AS I HEARD

01:10:52.147 --> 01:10:53.449
YOUR ANNOUNCEMENT. THANK YOU.

01:10:53.515 --> 01:10:54.750
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. APPRECIATE

01:10:54.817 --> 01:10:57.786
IT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?

01:10:57.853 --> 01:11:02.291
COMMENTS, VICE CHAIR GONZALEZ.

01:11:02.358 --> 01:11:04.360
THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR. I'VE, I

01:11:04.426 --> 01:11:06.562
THINK I'VE MADE IT PRETTY KNOWN

01:11:06.629 --> 01:11:08.664
TO A FEW OF YOU THAT WATER IS

01:11:08.731 --> 01:11:11.266
VERY IMPORTANT, ESPECIALLY US

01:11:11.333 --> 01:11:15.070
DESERT FOLKS. IN THE INLAND

01:11:15.137 --> 01:11:16.238
EMPIRE, IMPERIAL COUNTY, SAN

01:11:16.305 --> 01:11:18.040
BERNARDINO AND RIVERSIDE COUNTY.

01:11:18.107 --> 01:11:21.744
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT, BUT MORE

01:11:21.810 --> 01:11:23.379
SO THE THINKING ABOUT THE

01:11:23.445 --> 01:11:25.948
FUTURE. AND WE HAD A GREAT

01:11:26.015 --> 01:11:28.117
CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW DO WE

01:11:28.183 --> 01:11:30.686
REALLY START WORKING TOWARDS THE

01:11:30.753 --> 01:11:33.822
FUTURE OF WATER. MY COLLEAGUE

01:11:33.889 --> 01:11:35.891
ALREADY TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:37.593
ISSUES. I'M THANKFUL THAT THAT

01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:39.061
MY OTHER COLLEAGUE TALKED ABOUT

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:40.429
ALL THE PLAYERS INVOLVED. YOU

01:11:40.496 --> 01:11:43.499
YOU DID THAT. SO THANK YOU FOR

01:11:43.565 --> 01:11:44.633
YOUR LEADERSHIP AND YOUR

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:47.670
CONTINUED LEADERSHIP. I HAVE ONE

01:11:47.736 --> 01:11:49.705
QUESTION, MR. MILLER. I

01:11:49.772 --> 01:11:51.573
UNDERSTAND THERE WAS A RECENT

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:53.342
èC RESEARCH CONDUCTED THAT

01:11:53.409 --> 01:11:55.878
SHOWS BILLIONS IN ECONOMIC RISK

01:11:55.944 --> 01:11:57.780
IF THE STATE CONTINUES THE

01:11:57.846 --> 01:12:00.215
STATUS QUO ON WATER SUPPLY, HOW

01:12:00.282 --> 01:12:02.985
WOULD SB 72 ADDRESS THESE

01:12:03.052 --> 01:12:08.090
CONCERNS? YEAH, WHEN WE TRY AND

01:12:08.157 --> 01:12:09.158
ARTICULATE THE RISK OF NOT

01:12:09.224 --> 01:12:10.993
HAVING ENOUGH WATER SUPPLY, IT'S

01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:13.395
REALLY HARD TO GET 9 MILLION

01:12:13.462 --> 01:12:18.133
ACRE FEET INTO A TERMINOLOGY

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:20.602
THAT NORMAL PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT

01:12:20.669 --> 01:12:21.070
IN THE WATER INDUSTRY

01:12:21.136 --> 01:12:22.371
UNDERSTAND. AND SO WE REALLY

01:12:22.438 --> 01:12:24.907
WANTED TO PUT A FINANCIAL SPIN

01:12:24.973 --> 01:12:27.276
ON THAT. AND SO WHAT WOULD THAT

01:12:27.342 --> 01:12:30.345
MEAN TO THIS ECONOMY, THIS HUGE

01:12:30.412 --> 01:12:33.482
ECONOMY THAT CALIFORNIA DRIVES.

01:12:33.549 --> 01:12:35.751
AND IF WE'RE NOT BUILDING THE 9

01:12:35.818 --> 01:12:38.620
MILLION ACRE FEET, WE ASKED THE

01:12:38.687 --> 01:12:39.688
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TO DO A

01:12:39.755 --> 01:12:41.090
STUDY AND SAID, WELL, WHAT WOULD

01:12:41.156 --> 01:12:42.591
HAPPEN TO THE ECONOMY? BECAUSE

01:12:42.658 --> 01:12:44.526
WE KNOW AS WATER MANAGERS, WE'RE

01:12:44.593 --> 01:12:46.595
THE ONES THAT EVALUATE NOT

01:12:46.662 --> 01:12:48.864
APPROVING HOUSING TRACTS, A LOT

01:12:48.931 --> 01:12:50.866
A LOT OF INFORMATION AND NEWS ON

01:12:50.933 --> 01:12:53.268
HOUSING YESTERDAY. AND IT COMES

01:12:53.335 --> 01:12:56.205
TO US TO APPROVE HOUSING STARTS.

01:12:56.271 --> 01:12:58.674
AND IF WE HAVE TO START, YOU

01:12:58.741 --> 01:13:00.909
KNOW, CUTTING BACK BECAUSE WE

01:13:00.976 --> 01:13:01.777
DON'T HAVE THE WATER SUPPLY

01:13:01.844 --> 01:13:03.912
THAT'S GOING TO BE AVAILABLE FOR

01:13:03.979 --> 01:13:04.980
THE NEXT 20 YEARS, WE CAN'T

01:13:05.047 --> 01:13:06.315
APPROVE THOSE. SO THIS IS ALL

01:13:06.381 --> 01:13:08.784
ABOUT ENOUGH WATER FOR ALL USES,

01:13:08.851 --> 01:13:11.987
NOT JUST POPULATION, NOT JUST

01:13:12.054 --> 01:13:14.056
THE ECONOMY, BUT THE ENVIRONMENT

01:13:14.123 --> 01:13:15.924
AND EVERYTHING. AND YOU SEE,

01:13:15.991 --> 01:13:18.293
BACKED US UP AND DID THIS VERY,

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:20.295
VERY COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION OF

01:13:20.362 --> 01:13:23.532
LITERATURE AND SAID IT'S UP TO A

01:13:23.599 --> 01:13:25.968
$14.5 BILLION ANNUAL IMPACT. SO

01:13:26.034 --> 01:13:28.103
WE THINK ABOUT THE EXPENSE OF

01:13:28.170 --> 01:13:29.738
COST OF RESERVOIRS AND

01:13:29.805 --> 01:13:32.141
CONVEYANCE SYSTEMS AT, YOU KNOW,

01:13:32.207 --> 01:13:33.876
5 OR $10 BILLION. IT SOUNDS

01:13:33.942 --> 01:13:35.778
EXPENSIVE. THE COST OF INACTION

01:13:35.844 --> 01:13:37.913
PALES THOSE COSTS. AND SO WE

01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:40.082
NEED TO MOVE PROJECTS AND HAVE A

01:13:40.149 --> 01:13:41.950
PLAN TO DO THAT. AND THIS BILL

01:13:42.017 --> 01:13:44.153
IS ALL ABOUT A LONG TERM PLAN.

01:13:44.219 --> 01:13:46.155
AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I WANTED

01:13:46.221 --> 01:13:47.756
TO MAKE SURE THAT I ASKED THAT

01:13:47.823 --> 01:13:49.258
QUESTION. SO THAT WAY EVERYONE

01:13:49.324 --> 01:13:50.959
CAN HEAR WHAT'S GOING ON. THIS

01:13:51.026 --> 01:13:52.761
BILL IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT

01:13:52.828 --> 01:13:54.630
DIRECTION. AND BUT

01:13:54.696 --> 01:13:55.697
UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAVE TO

01:13:55.764 --> 01:13:57.466
CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR THIS TYPE

01:13:57.533 --> 01:14:00.002
OF PLAN EVERY YEAR TO MAKE SURE

01:14:00.068 --> 01:14:01.737
THAT WE GET THE APPROPRIATE

01:14:01.804 --> 01:14:03.906
AMOUNT OF ATTENTION AND FUNDING

01:14:03.972 --> 01:14:05.174
SO THAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH WHAT

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:06.475
WE NEED TO ACCOMPLISH, BECAUSE,

01:14:06.542 --> 01:14:08.010
YOU KNOW, WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO

01:14:08.076 --> 01:14:09.878
COME UP TO A CLIFF, RIGHT? YES.

01:14:09.945 --> 01:14:10.846
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE

01:14:10.913 --> 01:14:12.514
CONSERVATION SIDE OF THINGS, BUT

01:14:12.581 --> 01:14:14.883
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE CLIFF OF

01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:16.185
REALITY, OF IF WE DON'T IF WE

01:14:16.251 --> 01:14:18.654
DON'T CAPTURE THIS WATER, THE

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:21.223
LOSS IS MUCH GREATER THAN THAN

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:23.225
THE INVESTMENT OF WHAT WE'RE

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:24.927
TALKING ABOUT. SO AGAIN, THANK

01:14:24.993 --> 01:14:26.461
YOU, SENATOR. I APPRECIATE YOUR

01:14:26.528 --> 01:14:28.363
YOUR LEADERSHIP. ANY BACKUP YOU

01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:31.300
NEED ON THIS, MY HOUSE IS HERE

01:14:31.366 --> 01:14:33.135
TO SUPPORT. SO THANK YOU, THANK

01:14:33.202 --> 01:14:35.671
YOU, THANK YOU. VICE CHAIR. ANY

01:14:35.737 --> 01:14:38.807
OTHER MEMBERS WISHING TO COMMENT

01:14:38.874 --> 01:14:42.811
THEN I GUESS THAT LEAVES ME. YOU

01:14:42.878 --> 01:14:45.848
KNOW, THIS THAT PHRASE FAIL TO

01:14:45.914 --> 01:14:47.816
PLAN, PLAN TO FAIL COMES COMES

01:14:47.883 --> 01:14:49.051
TO MIND AS IT RELATES TO THIS

01:14:49.117 --> 01:14:51.520
BILL. SO I WANT TO THANK THE

01:14:51.587 --> 01:14:52.120
AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THE BILL,

01:14:52.187 --> 01:14:54.356
AND I THINK YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT

01:14:54.423 --> 01:14:56.091
TRACK. MANAGEMENT IS A HUGE

01:14:56.158 --> 01:14:57.626
PRIORITY GIVEN OUR CLIMATE

01:14:57.693 --> 01:14:59.094
SWINGS. IT'S NOT WHAT WE HAVE

01:14:59.161 --> 01:15:00.896
ENOUGH WATER ONE DAY IT'S WILL

01:15:00.963 --> 01:15:03.599
WE NOT HAVE ENOUGH WATER ONE DAY

01:15:03.665 --> 01:15:06.935
AND WE'RE GOING TO BE IN REAL

01:15:07.002 --> 01:15:08.503
TROUBLE IF WE CAN'T BE NIMBLE,

01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:10.305
IF WE CAN'T BE FLEXIBLE, IF WE

01:15:10.372 --> 01:15:12.708
CAN'T HARNESS THE GOOD TIMES.

01:15:12.774 --> 01:15:15.944
AND THAT DOES INCLUDE BUILDING

01:15:16.011 --> 01:15:17.713
INFRASTRUCTURE. AND IT MAY SEEM

01:15:17.779 --> 01:15:21.016
AT TIMES THAT IT IS TOO MUCH,

01:15:21.083 --> 01:15:22.885
BUT IT ALSO MAY SEEM WHEN WE

01:15:22.951 --> 01:15:24.987
HAVE THESE DELUGES OF WATER AND

01:15:25.053 --> 01:15:26.555
SEEING IT GOING, AND THEN WE

01:15:26.622 --> 01:15:27.956
HAVEN'T HARNESSED IT FOR THE BAD

01:15:28.023 --> 01:15:30.692
TIMES THAT WE DIDN'T PLAN. AND I

01:15:30.759 --> 01:15:32.094
JUST DON'T WANT OUR KIDS TO SAY

01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:34.997
THAT. AND I, I MAKE THESE

01:15:35.063 --> 01:15:36.765
COMMENTS THAT, YOU KNOW, IN THE

01:15:36.832 --> 01:15:37.933
LAST CENTURY, THERE WERE A LOT

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.602
OF FOLKS THAT HAD A LOT OF

01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:42.638
FORESIGHT TO BUILD OUR ROADS, TO

01:15:42.704 --> 01:15:44.373
BUILD OUR WASTEWATER TREATMENT

01:15:44.439 --> 01:15:45.941
PLANTS. AND SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW

01:15:46.008 --> 01:15:47.776
THAT WHEN I FIRST RAN FOR OFFICE

01:15:47.843 --> 01:15:49.845
IN MY LOCAL CITY COUNCIL, WHERE

01:15:49.912 --> 01:15:51.947
WE WERE ABOUT TO TAKE ON A $1

01:15:52.014 --> 01:15:53.015
BILLION WASTEWATER TREATMENT

01:15:53.081 --> 01:15:54.483
PLANT, WHICH IS BIG FOR ANY

01:15:54.549 --> 01:15:56.285
MUNICIPALITY THAT IS OF AVERAGE

01:15:56.351 --> 01:15:58.086
SIZE. IT WAS A BIG DEAL IN MY

01:15:58.153 --> 01:15:59.888
TAGLINE WAS I WAS GOING TO MAKE

01:15:59.955 --> 01:16:01.690
SEWER SEXY BECAUSE SO MUCH OF

01:16:01.757 --> 01:16:03.825
OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT SEXY

01:16:03.892 --> 01:16:05.360
AND PEOPLE ARE NOT. MY

01:16:05.427 --> 01:16:06.428
CONTEMPORARIES ARE NOT PAYING

01:16:06.495 --> 01:16:07.930
ATTENTION LIKE THEY DID IN

01:16:07.996 --> 01:16:10.999
POSTWAR, YOU KNOW, 1945 567 AS

01:16:11.066 --> 01:16:13.869
WE CAME BACK FROM THE WAR, WE

01:16:13.936 --> 01:16:14.503
WERE FOCUSED ON INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:16:14.569 --> 01:16:17.406
WE HAVEN'T BEEN FOR A LONG TIME.

01:16:17.472 --> 01:16:20.375
AND NOW WITH CLIMATE CHANGE,

01:16:20.442 --> 01:16:23.278
THAT URGENCY CANNOT BE

01:16:23.345 --> 01:16:24.046
UNDERSTATED. IT JUST REALLY

01:16:24.112 --> 01:16:26.048
CAN'T. SO I WANT TO THANK THE

01:16:26.114 --> 01:16:27.149
SENATOR FOR HAVING SOME VISION

01:16:27.215 --> 01:16:29.017
HERE. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE

01:16:29.084 --> 01:16:31.553
PERFECT, BUT IT ALLOWS US TO BE

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:33.689
FLEXIBLE. AND WHETHER THAT'S

01:16:33.755 --> 01:16:35.090
GOING TO BE THROUGH RECYCLING

01:16:35.157 --> 01:16:38.360
WATER, INCREASED CONSERVATION

01:16:38.427 --> 01:16:40.929
EFFORTS, GROUNDWATER RECHARGE,

01:16:40.996 --> 01:16:42.731
WHATEVER IT TAKES. I THINK WE

01:16:42.798 --> 01:16:44.933
NEED TO BE FLEXIBLE. WE NEED TO

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.101
BE NIMBLE AND SETTING THE

01:16:46.168 --> 01:16:47.035
TARGET. I'M NOT AFRAID OF A

01:16:47.102 --> 01:16:49.905
TARGET. IT'S ASPIRATIONAL, BUT I

01:16:49.972 --> 01:16:53.542
THINK THAT IT IS IMPERATIVE TO

01:16:53.608 --> 01:16:54.943
MANAGEMENT. SO I APPRECIATE YOU

01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:56.211
BRINGING THE BILL. I APPRECIATE

01:16:56.278 --> 01:16:58.613
YOU TAKING THIS ON. I'M HOPING

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:00.115
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HEARS

01:17:00.182 --> 01:17:03.185
OUR CALL AND THAT WE CAN DO

01:17:03.251 --> 01:17:04.586
RIGHT. I DON'T HAVE

01:17:04.653 --> 01:17:06.154
GRANDCHILDREN, BUT YOU MENTIONED

01:17:06.221 --> 01:17:08.557
THIS IDEA OF OUR GRANDCHILDREN,

01:17:08.623 --> 01:17:10.392
EVEN OUR OUR CHILDREN. AND WE

01:17:10.459 --> 01:17:12.127
GOT TO HAVE SOME FORESIGHT HERE.

01:17:12.194 --> 01:17:15.764
SO I'M VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF

01:17:15.831 --> 01:17:17.632
PLANNING SO THAT WE DO GET

01:17:17.699 --> 01:17:21.470
THERE. AND I WISH YOU GODSPEED.

01:17:21.536 --> 01:17:22.771
SO WITH THAT, WOULD YOU LIKE TO

01:17:22.838 --> 01:17:25.340
CLOSE? I'LL I'LL ACCEPT YOUR

01:17:25.407 --> 01:17:27.275
LAST STATEMENTS AS AS MY

01:17:27.342 --> 01:17:28.710
CLOSING. HONEST TO GOODNESS.

01:17:28.777 --> 01:17:30.245
THIS IS THIS IS ABOUT PLANNING.

01:17:30.312 --> 01:17:33.782
IT'S ABOUT NOT WAITING UNTIL

01:17:33.849 --> 01:17:35.550
WE'RE IN A CRISIS. LIKE

01:17:35.617 --> 01:17:37.185
FLOODING, SEVERE FLOODING WHERE

01:17:37.252 --> 01:17:39.721
WE SPEND $20 MILLION IN A SMALL

01:17:39.788 --> 01:17:41.757
LITTLE, ACTUALLY, TWICE IN

01:17:41.823 --> 01:17:42.991
SMALL, LITTLE FARMWORKER

01:17:43.058 --> 01:17:45.961
COMMUNITIES, BECAUSE WE DIDN'T

01:17:46.028 --> 01:17:49.664

01:19:12.214 --> 01:19:14.850

MEMBERS, I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT

01:19:33.802 --> 01:19:37.272
SB 369, DEALING WITH THE SALTON

01:19:37.339 --> 01:19:38.240
SEA RESTORATION AND SKILLED AND

01:19:38.306 --> 01:19:39.908
TRAINED WORKFORCE STANDARDS.

01:19:39.975 --> 01:19:41.243
THIS BILL WILL STATUTORILY

01:19:41.309 --> 01:19:42.544
REQUIRE THE USE OF A LOCAL,

01:19:42.611 --> 01:19:43.245
SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE

01:19:43.311 --> 01:19:44.913
FOR ALL RESTORATION WORK AT THE

01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:47.349
SALTON SEA. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW,

01:19:47.415 --> 01:19:48.383
OUR LARGEST INLAND BODY OF

01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:50.585
WATER, THE SALTON SEA, HAS BEEN

01:19:50.652 --> 01:19:51.453
RAPIDLY DEPLETED DUE TO

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:52.754
DECREASED WATER INFLOW. AS A

01:19:52.821 --> 01:19:54.556
RESULT, THE LAKE IS BECOMING

01:19:54.623 --> 01:19:55.190
INCREASINGLY SALINE AND

01:19:55.257 --> 01:19:56.658
RELEASING DUST PARTICLES THAT

01:19:56.725 --> 01:19:57.993
FURTHER WORSEN SOME OF THE WORST

01:19:58.059 --> 01:20:00.028
AIR QUALITY IN OUR STATE. IN THE

01:20:00.095 --> 01:20:01.062
INLAND EMPIRE, THE STATE AND THE

01:20:01.129 --> 01:20:02.531
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE PROVIDED

01:20:02.597 --> 01:20:03.932
FUNDS TO WORK ON RESTORATION

01:20:03.999 --> 01:20:05.133
PROJECTS AT THE SALTON SEA,

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:06.601
WHICH IS CRITICAL TO ENSURING

01:20:06.668 --> 01:20:08.370
THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF THE

01:20:08.436 --> 01:20:10.105
SEA ITSELF, THE OVERALL

01:20:10.172 --> 01:20:11.406
ECOSYSTEM, AND BOTH THE PUBLIC

01:20:11.473 --> 01:20:12.941
HEALTH, AIR QUALITY, AND EVEN

01:20:13.008 --> 01:20:14.376
ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF THE

01:20:14.442 --> 01:20:15.844
REGION. WORKERS PERFORMING

01:20:15.911 --> 01:20:17.579
RESTORATION PROJECTS FACE

01:20:17.646 --> 01:20:19.314
EXPOSURE AT HIGH LEVELS TO TOXIC

01:20:19.381 --> 01:20:20.849
SUBSTANCES BECAUSE OF THEIR

01:20:20.916 --> 01:20:22.050
PROXIMITY AND THEIR INTERACTION

01:20:22.117 --> 01:20:24.052
WITH THE LAKEBED, THE IMPERIAL

01:20:24.119 --> 01:20:25.487
VALLEY ALREADY HAS HIGH

01:20:25.554 --> 01:20:26.588
UNEMPLOYMENT RATES, AND MANY

01:20:26.655 --> 01:20:28.056
RESIDENTS FACE POOR WORKING

01:20:28.123 --> 01:20:30.192
CONDITIONS AND LOW WAGES. GIVEN

01:20:30.258 --> 01:20:31.193
THE RISK TO WORKERS, THE STATE

01:20:31.259 --> 01:20:33.094
NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY, THE

01:20:33.161 --> 01:20:34.462
DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES,

01:20:34.529 --> 01:20:35.263
THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND

01:20:35.330 --> 01:20:37.399
WILDLIFE ARE UTILIZING A STATUTE

01:20:37.465 --> 01:20:39.134
FOR DESIGN BUILD PROJECTS THAT

01:20:39.201 --> 01:20:40.302
CONTRACTORS ON RESTORATION

01:20:40.368 --> 01:20:41.736
PROJECTS UTILIZE A SKILLED AND

01:20:41.803 --> 01:20:43.838
TRAINED WORKFORCE. THESE

01:20:43.905 --> 01:20:45.073
WORKFORCE REQUIREMENTS ENSURE

01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:46.408
THAT A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF

01:20:46.474 --> 01:20:47.842
WORKERS ENGAGED ON COVERED

01:20:47.909 --> 01:20:49.044
PROJECTS HAVE GRADUATED FROM A

01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:51.146
STATE REGISTERED APPRENTICESHIP

01:20:51.213 --> 01:20:52.881
PROGRAM. IT ALSO ENSURES LOCAL

01:20:52.948 --> 01:20:53.582
WORKERS PARTICIPATING ON

01:20:53.648 --> 01:20:55.016
PROJECTS ARE PAID LIVING WAGES

01:20:55.083 --> 01:20:56.518
AND PROVIDED WITH HEALTH AND

01:20:56.585 --> 01:20:58.220
WELFARE BENEFITS FOR THEMSELVES

01:20:58.286 --> 01:20:59.821
AND FOR THEIR FAMILIES. SKILLED

01:20:59.888 --> 01:21:01.223
AND TRAINED REQUIREMENTS

01:21:01.289 --> 01:21:02.991
ESTABLISH A PIPELINE, A LONG

01:21:03.058 --> 01:21:04.793
TERM PIPELINE FOR WORKERS, FOR

01:21:04.859 --> 01:21:06.228
FUTURE PROJECTS THAT WILL

01:21:06.294 --> 01:21:07.028
BENEFIT THE RESIDENTS OF THE

01:21:07.095 --> 01:21:08.430
IMPERIAL VALLEY FOR YEARS TO

01:21:08.496 --> 01:21:10.599
COME. THE STATE IS CURRENTLY

01:21:10.665 --> 01:21:11.499
ADMINISTRATIVELY ENSURING THAT

01:21:11.566 --> 01:21:12.667
PROTECTION OF THESE WORKERS IS

01:21:12.734 --> 01:21:14.436
SALTON SEA RESTORATION PROJECTS,

01:21:14.502 --> 01:21:16.271
AND THERE'S CURRENTLY NOTHING IN

01:21:16.338 --> 01:21:18.840
STATUTE THAT GUARANTEES THIS IN

01:21:18.907 --> 01:21:21.009
THE LONG TERM. THIS IS RELEVANT

01:21:21.076 --> 01:21:22.043
PARTICULARLY BECAUSE OF THE

01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:24.212
LEVEL OF LIABILITY, FRANKLY, AND

01:21:24.279 --> 01:21:25.280
FINANCIAL INVESTMENT THE STATE

01:21:25.347 --> 01:21:27.215
OF CALIFORNIA HAS MADE IN THE

01:21:27.282 --> 01:21:29.317
PAST AND WILL MAKE IN THE FUTURE

01:21:29.384 --> 01:21:31.019
ON THESE RESTORATION EFFORTS.

01:21:31.086 --> 01:21:32.053
WITHOUT THESE PROTECTIONS, IN

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:33.955
THE LONG RUN, THEY CAN BE

01:21:34.022 --> 01:21:34.923
POTENTIAL GREAT PUBLIC SAFETY

01:21:34.990 --> 01:21:36.591
AND PUBLIC HEALTH RISKS TO

01:21:36.658 --> 01:21:37.459
CITIZENS AND WORKERS IN THE

01:21:37.525 --> 01:21:39.160
REGION. IN AN EFFORT TO ENSURE

01:21:39.227 --> 01:21:40.829
THESE PROTECTIONS AND A

01:21:40.895 --> 01:21:41.896
WORKFORCE PIPELINE FOR

01:21:41.963 --> 01:21:42.897
RESIDENTS, IMPERIAL VALLEY AND

01:21:42.964 --> 01:21:44.733
THE RAPID COMPLETION OF SALTON

01:21:44.799 --> 01:21:46.034
SEA RESTORATION PROJECTS, THIS

01:21:46.101 --> 01:21:47.636
BILL WOULD STATUTORILY REQUIRE

01:21:47.702 --> 01:21:49.070
THE USE OF A LOCAL, SKILLED AND

01:21:49.137 --> 01:21:50.538
TRAINED WORKFORCE FOR ALL

01:21:50.605 --> 01:21:51.940

01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:11.826
TO ENSURE THE PROTECTION OF

01:22:11.893 --> 01:22:13.028
WORKERS AT THE SALTON SEA AND

01:22:13.094 --> 01:22:15.030
THE RAPID COMPLETION OF SALTON

01:22:15.096 --> 01:22:16.431
SEA RESTORATION PROJECTS. AS I

01:22:16.498 --> 01:22:17.799

YOUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS, THE

01:22:21.236 --> 01:22:22.137
TOXIC NATURE OF THE DECLINING

01:22:22.203 --> 01:22:24.439
LAKE BED AT THE SALTON SEA HAS

01:22:24.506 --> 01:22:25.407
RESULTED IN POOR AIR QUALITY

01:22:25.473 --> 01:22:27.108
ACROSS THE IMPERIAL VALLEY THAT

01:22:27.175 --> 01:22:29.077
IS HARMING BOTH WILDLIFE AND

01:22:29.144 --> 01:22:30.111
RESIDENTS OF THE SURROUNDING

01:22:30.178 --> 01:22:32.080
COMMUNITY. COUPLED WITH THAT IS

01:22:32.147 --> 01:22:34.482
THE FACT THAT AS OF LAST MONTH,

01:22:34.549 --> 01:22:35.317
IMPERIAL VALLEY, IMPERIAL

01:22:35.383 --> 01:22:37.952
COUNTY, EXCUSE ME, HAD A 17.4%

01:22:38.019 --> 01:22:39.487
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, WHICH

01:22:39.554 --> 01:22:40.255
UNFORTUNATELY IS THE HIGHEST IN

01:22:40.322 --> 01:22:42.324
THE STATE. GIVEN THE SEVERITY OF

01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:43.958
THE SITUATION DOWN AT THE SALTON

01:22:44.025 --> 01:22:45.327
SEA, THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL

01:22:45.393 --> 01:22:47.062
GOVERNMENT HAVE EXPENDED

01:22:47.128 --> 01:22:47.929
SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO RESTORE

01:22:47.996 --> 01:22:49.898
THIS TOXIC BODY OF WATER, AND

01:22:49.964 --> 01:22:51.766
THEY HAVE DONE SO IN AN EFFORT

01:22:51.833 --> 01:22:53.268
TO PROTECT THE ECOSYSTEM AND

01:22:53.335 --> 01:22:54.402
RESIDENTS OF THE IMPERIAL

01:22:54.469 --> 01:22:55.970
VALLEY. IMPORTANTLY, THESE

01:22:56.037 --> 01:22:57.405
CRITICAL PROJECTS PRESENT AN

01:22:57.472 --> 01:22:58.907
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE TO

01:22:58.973 --> 01:23:00.275
ENSURE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT

01:23:00.342 --> 01:23:01.409
OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOCAL

01:23:01.476 --> 01:23:02.410
CONSTRUCTION WORKERS AND

01:23:02.477 --> 01:23:04.279
ASPIRING CONSTRUCTION WORKERS AS

01:23:04.346 --> 01:23:05.747
APPRENTICES WHO ARE SEEKING TO

01:23:05.814 --> 01:23:07.916
LEARN A TRADE AND PAVE THEIR WAY

01:23:07.982 --> 01:23:09.184
TO THE MIDDLE CLASS. IT'S

01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:09.818
IMPORTANT TO NOTE, AS THE

01:23:09.884 --> 01:23:11.820
SENATOR ALSO MENTIONED, THAT THE

01:23:11.886 --> 01:23:13.021
STATE HAS ALREADY TAKEN ACTIVE

01:23:13.088 --> 01:23:14.122
STEPS TO ENSURE THE PROTECTION

01:23:14.189 --> 01:23:15.023
OF WORKERS ON THESE PROJECTS AND

01:23:15.090 --> 01:23:17.225
ARE CURRENTLY REQUIRING THAT FOR

01:23:17.292 --> 01:23:17.759
DESIGN BUILD CONSTRUCTION

01:23:17.826 --> 01:23:18.660
PROJECTS AT THE SALTON SEA,

01:23:18.727 --> 01:23:19.961
SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE

01:23:20.028 --> 01:23:21.896
MUST BE UTILIZED. SO WITH ALL

01:23:21.963 --> 01:23:23.465
THAT BEING SAID, SB 369 WOULD

01:23:23.531 --> 01:23:24.799
ENSURE THAT A SKILLED AND

01:23:24.866 --> 01:23:25.900
TRAINED WORKFORCE WOULD BE

01:23:25.967 --> 01:23:27.335
UTILIZED FOR ALL CONSTRUCTION AT

01:23:27.402 --> 01:23:28.303
THE SALTON SEA, REGARDLESS OF

01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:30.205
HOW THE PROJECT IS PROCURED, AND

01:23:30.271 --> 01:23:31.706
BY CODIFYING THESE LABOR

01:23:31.773 --> 01:23:33.141
STANDARDS, THE STATE WILL BE

01:23:33.208 --> 01:23:34.676
TAKING AN ACTIVE STEP TO ENSURE

01:23:34.743 --> 01:23:35.176

PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY JOBS, AND

01:23:38.513 --> 01:23:40.215
CREATE A PIPELINE OF WORKERS

01:23:40.281 --> 01:23:40.949
THAT WILL BENEFIT RESIDENTS OF

01:23:41.015 --> 01:23:42.751
THE IMPERIAL VALLEY FOR YEARS TO

01:23:42.817 --> 01:23:44.486
COME. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

01:23:44.552 --> 01:23:45.787
QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS AND WOULD

01:23:45.854 --> 01:23:46.388

TRADES OF CALIFORNIA, MATT DID A

01:23:52.026 --> 01:23:54.129
GREAT JOB OF LAYING IT OUT. I'D

01:23:54.195 --> 01:23:55.797
LIKE TO MAKE IT A LITTLE EASIER.

01:23:55.864 --> 01:23:57.932
I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN, I THINK

01:23:57.999 --> 01:23:58.466
ALMOST EVERY DESIGN BUILD

01:23:58.533 --> 01:23:59.834
PROCUREMENT LAW FOR THE LAST 25

01:23:59.901 --> 01:24:00.769
YEARS. WE PUT SKILLS AND

01:24:00.835 --> 01:24:02.237
TRAINING IN THERE BECAUSE

01:24:02.303 --> 01:24:03.238
OFTENTIMES THOSE PROJECTS ARE

01:24:03.304 --> 01:24:04.739
COMPLEX. WITH REGARDS TO THE

01:24:04.806 --> 01:24:06.441
SALTON SEA, I LIKE TO BRING DOWN

01:24:06.508 --> 01:24:08.309
EVEN A LITTLE LOWER. WE PUT

01:24:08.376 --> 01:24:10.445
FIRST RESPONDERS INTO SITUATIONS

01:24:10.512 --> 01:24:12.013
WITH CHEMICALS AND OTHER TYPES

01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:12.947
OF MATERIALS. WE MAKE SURE THOSE

01:24:13.014 --> 01:24:14.783
FIRST RESPONDERS ARE TRAINED AND

01:24:14.849 --> 01:24:16.651
HAVE THE SPECIFIC SKILLS TO

01:24:16.718 --> 01:24:18.720
OPERATE SAFELY. THE SALTON SEA,

01:24:18.787 --> 01:24:20.355
AS YOU'VE JUST HEARD, HAS

01:24:20.422 --> 01:24:22.056
DANGERS THAT NOT ONLY EXPOSE

01:24:22.123 --> 01:24:23.391
RESIDENTS AND OUR ENVIRONMENT,

01:24:23.458 --> 01:24:24.159
BUT ALSO THOSE THAT ARE DOING

01:24:24.225 --> 01:24:26.027
WORK THERE. SO WHETHER THEY'RE

01:24:26.094 --> 01:24:27.328
DOING A DESIGN BUILD PROJECT

01:24:27.395 --> 01:24:28.530
SPECIFICALLY IN OUR PROCUREMENT

01:24:28.596 --> 01:24:29.931
THERE, OR WHETHER IT'S JUST A

01:24:29.998 --> 01:24:31.366
DESIGN BID BUILD PROJECT, IT'S

01:24:31.433 --> 01:24:32.434
IMPERATIVE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING

01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:34.335
THOSE WORKERS WITH THE ABILITY

01:24:34.402 --> 01:24:36.137
TO MAINTAIN SOME SAFETY. I WOULD

01:24:36.204 --> 01:24:37.939
ALSO SAY AND AGREE THAT HAVING

01:24:38.006 --> 01:24:38.940
THE SKILLED AND TRAINED

01:24:39.007 --> 01:24:41.409
WORKFORCE DOES PROVIDE THAT,

01:24:41.476 --> 01:24:43.378
THAT HAND UP TO GIVE INDIVIDUALS

01:24:43.445 --> 01:24:45.046
NOT ONLY OPPORTUNITY TO GET

01:24:45.113 --> 01:24:47.949
TRAINED IN A TRADE AND HAVE A

01:24:48.016 --> 01:24:49.350
CAREER WITH RETIREMENT AND

01:24:49.417 --> 01:24:51.186
BENEFITS, BUT IT ALSO THIS THIS

01:24:51.252 --> 01:24:53.254
SPECIFIC PROJECT, IT'S CRITICAL

01:24:53.321 --> 01:24:54.789
THAT WE PROVIDE THE SAFETY THAT

01:24:54.856 --> 01:24:56.257
A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE

01:24:56.324 --> 01:24:57.659
WILL RECEIVE IN TRAINING TO

01:24:57.725 --> 01:24:59.194
OPERATE IN A IN AN AREA THAT IS

01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:00.662
DANGEROUS NOT ONLY FOR THEM

01:25:00.728 --> 01:25:01.963
DIRECTLY, BUT ALSO FOR THE

01:25:02.030 --> 01:25:03.331

AREA. I LIVE A FEW MILES AWAY,

01:26:07.161 --> 01:26:09.430
LITERALLY A FEW MILES AWAY. SO

01:26:09.497 --> 01:26:11.933

THIS IS USEFUL IN ANY

01:32:48.262 --> 01:32:49.063
