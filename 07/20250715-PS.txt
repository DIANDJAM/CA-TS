00:33:05.516 --> 00:33:07.452
WITNESS AND PUBLIC COMMENT

00:33:07.518 --> 00:33:08.086

00:33:08.152 --> 00:33:09.454

PLEASE SILENCE YOUR CELL PHONES

00:33:16.427 --> 00:33:17.862
IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY DONE SO.

00:33:17.929 --> 00:33:19.597
WE WILL NOT PERMIT. I WILL NOT

00:33:19.664 --> 00:33:21.032
PERMIT CONDUCT THAT DISRUPTS,

00:33:21.099 --> 00:33:22.100
DISTURBS, OR OTHERWISE IMPEDES

THE ORDERLY CONDUCT OF TODAY'S

00:33:25.203 --> 00:33:26.571
GIVE ONE AND ONLY ONE WARNING.

00:33:26.637 --> 00:33:28.072
PLEASE BE AWARE THAT VIOLATION

00:33:28.139 --> 00:33:29.874
OF THESE RULES WILL SUBJECT YOU

00:33:29.941 --> 00:33:31.542
TO REMOVAL OR OTHER ENFORCEMENT

00:33:31.609 --> 00:33:33.678
ACTIONS. WE HAVE THE OFF

00:33:33.745 --> 00:33:36.080

NOT YET HAVE A QUORUM. HOWEVER,

PROCEED WITH A SUBCOMMITTEE. SO

00:33:45.089 --> 00:33:46.958
WE WILL PUT ASIDE OUR CONSENT

TIME THAT DUE TO SCHEDULING

00:33:50.828 --> 00:33:52.930
ISSUES, WE ARE MAKING SPECIAL

00:33:52.997 --> 00:33:53.798
ACCOMMODATIONS BY ALLOWING

00:33:53.865 --> 00:33:55.133

OTHER MEASURES, WE ARE HEARING

MEASURE IS A RESOLUTION THAT WAS

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:10.882
ADDED TO OUR AGENDA YESTERDAY.

00:34:10.948 --> 00:34:12.550
AS ALWAYS, AUTHORS WILL HAVE

00:34:12.617 --> 00:34:14.619

00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:21.259
COMMITTEE STANDING PRACTICE.

00:34:21.325 --> 00:34:30.268
WELL. ONE MOMENT. SENATOR WAHAB,

CHAIRING SENATE PUBLIC SAFETY,

00:34:47.985 --> 00:34:50.588
TO GO FIRST. MR. VICE CHAIR IS

00:34:50.655 --> 00:34:52.623
JUST YOU. OH, AND MR. GONZALEZ

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:54.459
IS WITH US AS WELL. WE'LL START

00:34:54.525 --> 00:34:57.795
WITH SENATOR ARAGON. THIS IS.

00:34:57.862 --> 00:35:00.431
BEAR WITH ME. THIS THIS IS ITEM

00:35:00.498 --> 00:35:01.866
NUMBER 19. COLLEAGUES, SENATE

00:35:01.933 --> 00:35:05.703
BILL 705 704, ENTITLED FIREARMS,

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:07.672
FIREARM BARRELS. SENATOR ARAGON,

00:35:07.738 --> 00:35:08.973
THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU,

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.441
MISTER CHAIR. MEMBERS FOR THE

00:35:10.508 --> 00:35:11.909
OPPORTUNITY. PRESENT SB 704.

00:35:11.976 --> 00:35:13.377
FIRST, I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY

00:35:13.444 --> 00:35:14.178
ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE'S

00:35:14.245 --> 00:35:15.146
AMENDMENT, WHICH REDUCED THE

00:35:15.213 --> 00:35:16.447
CRIMINAL PENALTIES. UNDER THE

00:35:16.514 --> 00:35:18.716
BILL, SB 704 REQUIRES THAT THE

00:35:18.783 --> 00:35:20.551
PURCHASE OF A FIREARM BARREL

00:35:20.618 --> 00:35:22.220
FOLLOW A SIMILAR PROCESS AS TO

00:35:22.286 --> 00:35:23.287
WHEN SOMEONE PURCHASES A

00:35:23.354 --> 00:35:25.590
FIREARM. THAT IS, IT MUST BE

00:35:25.656 --> 00:35:26.190
CONDUCTED IN PERSON, THROUGH A

00:35:26.257 --> 00:35:27.692
LICENSED DEALER, AND WITH A

00:35:27.758 --> 00:35:28.392
BACKGROUND CHECK CONDUCTED ON

00:35:28.459 --> 00:35:30.628
THE PURCHASER. LET'S PUT THIS IN

00:35:30.695 --> 00:35:32.363
CONTEXT. IN 2019 TO 2021, THE

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:33.931
NUMBER OF GHOST GUNS RECOVERED

00:35:33.998 --> 00:35:35.166
FROM A CRIME IN CALIFORNIA

00:35:35.233 --> 00:35:39.070
INCREASED BY 592%. IN THIS

00:35:39.136 --> 00:35:40.404
INCREASE IN GHOST GUNS ACCOUNTED

00:35:40.471 --> 00:35:41.772
FOR NEARLY 70% OF THE TOTAL

00:35:41.839 --> 00:35:43.274
NUMBER OF CRIME GUNS RECOVERED

00:35:43.341 --> 00:35:46.077
IN CALIFORNIA DURING THIS PERIOD

00:35:46.143 --> 00:35:47.512
AND FOLLOWING THIS DATA IN 2022

00:35:47.578 --> 00:35:49.981
AND 2023, CALIFORNIA ENACTED

00:35:50.047 --> 00:35:51.449
LEADING LAWS TO COMBAT THE

00:35:51.516 --> 00:35:53.217
MANUFACTURING OF GUN OF GHOST

00:35:53.284 --> 00:35:54.719
GUNS. HOWEVER, THE FIGHT IN

00:35:54.785 --> 00:35:56.821
COMBATING UNREGULATED FIREARMS

00:35:56.888 --> 00:35:57.889
CONTINUES. THE GHOST GUN

00:35:57.955 --> 00:35:59.323
INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO SEEK OUT

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:01.826
NEW WAYS TO MARKET. SKIP THE

00:36:01.893 --> 00:36:03.461
BACKGROUND CHECK ACCESS TO

00:36:03.528 --> 00:36:05.029
UNTRACEABLE FIREARMS. CRIMINALS

00:36:05.096 --> 00:36:05.963
AND SEGMENTS OF THE FIREARM

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:07.532
INDUSTRY HAVE PIVOTED AWAY FROM

00:36:07.598 --> 00:36:09.100
TRADITIONAL GHOST GUN PARTS AND

00:36:09.166 --> 00:36:11.135
KITS TOWARDS 3D PRINTING, ONCE

00:36:11.202 --> 00:36:12.537
AGAIN CIRCUMVENTING STATE AND

00:36:12.603 --> 00:36:15.506
FEDERAL FIREARM REGULATIONS. AND

00:36:15.573 --> 00:36:17.441
SO WHY THIS IS RELEVANT IS THAT

00:36:17.508 --> 00:36:19.544
THE PURCHASING OF A BARREL IS AN

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:21.679
ESSENTIAL PIECE OF A GUN AND

00:36:21.746 --> 00:36:22.747
ESSENTIAL PIECE TO HELP

00:36:22.813 --> 00:36:24.649
MANUFACTURE A GHOST. GUN BARRELS

00:36:24.715 --> 00:36:25.983
ARE ENTIRELY UNREGULATED AND CAN

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:27.785
BE PURCHASED ONLINE OR IN A

00:36:27.852 --> 00:36:29.453
STORE WITHOUT A BACKGROUND CHECK

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.856
OR ANY RESTRICTION. SB 704 SEEKS

00:36:31.923 --> 00:36:32.990
TO CLOSE THIS LOOPHOLE THAT

00:36:33.057 --> 00:36:34.325
ALLOWS INDIVIDUALS TO ACQUIRE

00:36:34.392 --> 00:36:35.393
FIREARM BARRELS USING GHOST GUNS

00:36:35.459 --> 00:36:37.228
WITHOUT OVERSIGHT, IN ORDER TO

00:36:37.295 --> 00:36:38.663
CURB GUN VIOLENCE IN OUR

00:36:38.729 --> 00:36:40.398
COMMUNITIES, WE HAVE EXEMPTED

00:36:40.464 --> 00:36:42.133
LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE HAVE LOWERED

00:36:42.199 --> 00:36:43.768
PENALTIES. WE HAVE REALLY TAKEN

00:36:43.834 --> 00:36:44.769
INTO CONSIDERATION THE INPUT

00:36:44.835 --> 00:36:47.138
WE'VE HEARD FROM STAKEHOLDERS.

00:36:47.204 --> 00:36:48.806
THIS BILL DOES EXEMPT THE

00:36:48.873 --> 00:36:50.875
PROCESS FOR LAWFUL GUN OWNERS,

00:36:50.942 --> 00:36:51.509
INCLUDING INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE

00:36:51.576 --> 00:36:52.710
ALREADY GONE THROUGH A

00:36:52.777 --> 00:36:53.744
BACKGROUND CHECK BECAUSE THEY

00:36:53.811 --> 00:36:55.279
PURCHASED A FIREARM. IT EXEMPTS

00:36:55.346 --> 00:36:56.314
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES,

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:57.648
INCLUDING THE MILITARY, A

00:36:57.715 --> 00:36:59.550
FEDERALLY LICENSED COLLECTOR,

00:36:59.617 --> 00:37:00.551
AMONG OTHERS. WITH ME TO

00:37:00.618 --> 00:37:02.286
TESTIFY. STEVEN LINDLEY, SENIOR

00:37:02.353 --> 00:37:03.521
PROGRAM MANAGER AT THE BRADY

00:37:03.588 --> 00:37:05.957
CAMPAIGN, AND JONATHAN FELDMAN,

00:37:06.023 --> 00:37:06.524
REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA

00:37:06.591 --> 00:37:08.159
POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. THANK

00:37:08.225 --> 00:37:10.428
YOU, MR. CHAIR AND COMMITTEE

00:37:10.494 --> 00:37:11.596
MEMBERS. MY NAME IS STEVEN LEE.

00:37:11.662 --> 00:37:13.798
I'M A 28 YEAR LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:37:13.864 --> 00:37:14.699
VETERAN AND FORMER CHIEF OF THE

00:37:14.765 --> 00:37:15.766
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

00:37:15.833 --> 00:37:17.468
JUSTICE, BUREAU OF FIREARMS.

00:37:17.535 --> 00:37:19.236
OVER PROBABLY THE LAST 20 YEARS,

00:37:19.303 --> 00:37:21.772
WE'VE HAD A GHOST GUN ISSUE HERE

00:37:21.839 --> 00:37:24.041
IN CALIFORNIA, AND IT BECAME

00:37:24.108 --> 00:37:26.877
PROGRESSIVELY WORSE. IN 2016, WE

00:37:26.944 --> 00:37:29.714
TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO PASS

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:30.748
LEGISLATION IN ORDER TO CURB

00:37:30.815 --> 00:37:32.550
THIS PROBLEM. HOWEVER, THAT WAS

00:37:32.617 --> 00:37:34.085
VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR AT THE

00:37:34.151 --> 00:37:36.187
TIME, AND THAT TIDAL WAVE OF

00:37:36.253 --> 00:37:37.588
GHOST GUNS CAME FROM CALIFORNIA

00:37:37.655 --> 00:37:39.323
AND WASHED ACROSS OUR COUNTRY.

00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:41.392
AND WE'VE SEEN A RAPID INCREASE

00:37:41.459 --> 00:37:43.327
IN THE NUMBER OF FIREARM GHOST

00:37:43.394 --> 00:37:45.596
GUN FIREARMS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:37:45.663 --> 00:37:46.697
CONFISCATED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT,

00:37:46.764 --> 00:37:48.065
NOT ONLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT

00:37:48.132 --> 00:37:50.234
ACROSS THE NATION. SO CALIFORNIA

00:37:50.301 --> 00:37:52.770
FINALLY TOOK ACTION TO CURB THE

00:37:52.837 --> 00:37:55.239
GHOST GUN ISSUE. HOWEVER, THAT

00:37:55.306 --> 00:37:57.008
JUST KIND OF SHIFTED THE PROBLEM

00:37:57.074 --> 00:37:59.644
FROM COMPLETELY MANUFACTURED

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:02.546
GHOST GUNS TO GHOST GUNS FRAMES

00:38:02.613 --> 00:38:03.848
BEING MANUFACTURED AT HOME WITH

00:38:03.914 --> 00:38:06.384
3D PRINTERS. THOSE 3D PRINTERS

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:08.953
HAVE BECOME VASTLY MORE

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:11.088
EFFICIENT AND RELIABLE. AND NOW

00:38:11.155 --> 00:38:12.657
WE HAVE THESE GHOST GUNS BEING

00:38:12.723 --> 00:38:14.291
PRODUCED AT HOME. ONE COMPONENT

00:38:14.358 --> 00:38:15.893
THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:18.095
PEOPLE TO PRODUCE AT HOME IS THE

00:38:18.162 --> 00:38:19.764
BARREL. IT NORMALLY NEEDS TO BE

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:21.666
PROFESSIONALLY MANUFACTURED, AND

00:38:21.732 --> 00:38:24.535
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEKING TO

00:38:24.602 --> 00:38:25.469
CURTAIL. THE GHOST GUN ISSUE

00:38:25.536 --> 00:38:27.772
WITH 3D PRINTERS IS HARD TO DEAL

00:38:27.838 --> 00:38:28.839
WITH THE SOFTWARE BECAUSE IT'S

00:38:28.906 --> 00:38:31.742
ALREADY OUT THERE. AND TO THE

00:38:31.809 --> 00:38:33.611
MANUFACTURERS OF THESE ITEMS,

00:38:33.678 --> 00:38:35.579
IT'S NOT REALLY ILLEGAL FOR THEM

00:38:35.646 --> 00:38:37.882
TO ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN. SO 3D

00:38:37.948 --> 00:38:39.784
PRINTED GUNS, THE WAY TO CONTROL

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:41.118
THAT IS THROUGH THE BARRELS.

00:38:41.185 --> 00:38:43.454
THANK YOU. I'M HERE FOR

00:38:43.521 --> 00:38:44.622
QUESTIONS AND I ASK FOR YOUR

00:38:44.689 --> 00:38:46.290
VOTE. HEY, GOOD MORNING, CHAIR

00:38:46.357 --> 00:38:47.658
MEMBERS JONATHAN FELDMAN WITH

00:38:47.725 --> 00:38:49.126
THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS

00:38:49.193 --> 00:38:50.461
ASSOCIATION. FIRST, I WANT TO

00:38:50.528 --> 00:38:51.495
APOLOGIZE THAT OUR LETTER DIDN'T

00:38:51.562 --> 00:38:54.231
GET IN ON TIME. WE TOOK A LATE

00:38:54.298 --> 00:38:55.433
SUPPORT POSITION ON THE BILL,

00:38:55.499 --> 00:38:56.400
AND THAT WAS LARGELY BECAUSE THE

00:38:56.467 --> 00:38:57.935
DEBATES INTERNALLY WITHIN THE

00:38:58.002 --> 00:39:00.037
CHIEFS ON FIREARMS REGULATIONS

00:39:00.104 --> 00:39:01.439
ARE CONTENTIOUS. RIGHT? IF YOU

00:39:01.505 --> 00:39:04.408
CAN IMAGINE, THERE ARE A LOT OF

00:39:04.475 --> 00:39:05.009
POLICE CHIEFS THAT HAVE FIRM

00:39:05.076 --> 00:39:06.210
SECOND AMENDMENT BELIEFS. BUT

00:39:06.277 --> 00:39:08.045
THROUGH THOSE CONVERSATIONS, OUR

00:39:08.112 --> 00:39:08.713
PERSPECTIVE AND OUR GUIDING

00:39:08.779 --> 00:39:10.881
PRINCIPLE ALWAYS IS WHAT IS GOOD

00:39:10.948 --> 00:39:14.552
FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. IT'S OVERALL

00:39:14.618 --> 00:39:15.419
THE BENEFITS VERSUS THE BURDENS.

00:39:15.486 --> 00:39:18.422
AND IN THIS CASE, ABSOLUTELY THE

00:39:18.489 --> 00:39:20.191
BENEFITS IN REGULATING THE

00:39:20.257 --> 00:39:22.059
BARRELS, WHICH ARE CRITICAL

00:39:22.126 --> 00:39:23.194
COMPONENTS OF THE GHOST GUNS

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:24.595
THAT ARE A PREVALENT PROBLEM AND

00:39:24.662 --> 00:39:25.830
BECOMING EVEN MORE SO THROUGHOUT

00:39:25.896 --> 00:39:28.199
THE STATE. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

00:39:28.265 --> 00:39:30.234
EVERY BIT OF INFORMATION THAT WE

00:39:30.301 --> 00:39:32.203
CAN GAIN TO INVESTIGATE, PREVENT

00:39:32.269 --> 00:39:33.437
AND PROTECT AGAINST GUN

00:39:33.504 --> 00:39:37.575
VIOLENCE, WE ADD TO THE BITS OF

00:39:37.641 --> 00:39:39.710
INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE TO DO

00:39:39.777 --> 00:39:41.112
EVERYTHING THAT WE POSSIBLY CAN

00:39:41.178 --> 00:39:43.114
TO PREVENT THE TYPE OF VIOLENCE

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:44.482
THAT IS BEING COMMITTED THROUGH

00:39:44.548 --> 00:39:46.050
THE USE OF THESE FIREARMS. AND

00:39:46.117 --> 00:39:47.251
FOR THAT REASON, WE STRONGLY

00:39:47.318 --> 00:39:49.286
SUPPORT THE BILL. ASK FOR YOUR

00:39:49.353 --> 00:39:50.287
VOTE. THANK YOU, SENATOR, FOR

00:39:50.354 --> 00:39:51.589
THE PRESENTATION. GENTLEMEN.

00:39:51.655 --> 00:39:52.623
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY.

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:53.724
NEXT, WE'LL HEAR THE METOOS.

00:39:53.791 --> 00:39:55.626
ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT OF THE

00:39:55.693 --> 00:39:57.394
BILL COME FORWARD. NAME,

00:39:57.461 --> 00:39:58.028
ORGANIZATION AND POSITION ONLY,

00:39:58.095 --> 00:39:59.730
PLEASE. ETHAN NAGLER, ON BEHALF

00:39:59.797 --> 00:40:02.833
OF THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA AND

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:07.772
STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. GOOD

00:40:07.838 --> 00:40:08.806
MORNING, CHAIR AND MEMBERS.

00:40:08.873 --> 00:40:10.407
REBECCA MARCUS, ON BEHALF OF MY

00:40:10.474 --> 00:40:11.842
COLLEAGUES AT EVERYTOWN FOR GUN

00:40:11.909 --> 00:40:13.878
SAFETY AND GIFFORDS, THANK YOU.

00:40:13.944 --> 00:40:17.648
IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU FOR THE

00:40:17.715 --> 00:40:18.949
CLARIFICATION. ANYONE ELSE? ALL

00:40:19.016 --> 00:40:20.718
RIGHT. WELL, NEXT, WITNESSES IN

00:40:20.785 --> 00:40:21.652
OPPOSITION. DO WE HAVE ANYONE

00:40:21.719 --> 00:40:23.020
HERE TESTIFYING IN OPPOSITION?

00:40:23.087 --> 00:40:24.688
WE DO. PLEASE COME FORWARD. ONCE

00:40:24.755 --> 00:40:25.790
YOU BEGIN SPEAKING, YOU WILL

00:40:25.856 --> 00:40:27.591
HAVE A COMBINED TOTAL TIME OF

00:40:27.658 --> 00:40:28.893
FIVE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE

00:40:28.959 --> 00:40:40.905
COMMITTEE. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT.

00:40:40.971 --> 00:40:41.972
MORNING, CHAIR AND MEMBERS. MY

00:40:42.039 --> 00:40:43.507
NAME IS ADAM WILSON. I'M HERE ON

00:40:43.574 --> 00:40:45.876
BEHALF OF GUN OWNERS OF

00:40:45.943 --> 00:40:46.677
CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA RIFLE AND

00:40:46.744 --> 00:40:48.112
PISTOL ASSOCIATION AND THE

00:40:48.179 --> 00:40:50.714
NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION. WE

00:40:50.781 --> 00:40:52.716
OPPOSE 704. IT'S BUILT ON

00:40:52.783 --> 00:40:53.851
SPECULATION, NOT EVIDENCE, AND

00:40:53.918 --> 00:40:55.653
IT TARGETS THE WRONG PEOPLE. THE

00:40:55.719 --> 00:40:57.354
AUTHOR CLAIMS THIS BILL WILL

00:40:57.421 --> 00:40:58.989
STOP GHOST GUNS BY REGULATING

00:40:59.056 --> 00:41:00.658
FIREARM BARRELS. BUT

00:41:00.724 --> 00:41:02.092
CALIFORNIA'S OWN DOJ GHOST GUN

00:41:02.159 --> 00:41:03.894
REPORT MAKES IT CLEAR THAT THE

00:41:03.961 --> 00:41:05.729
VAST MAJORITY OF PRIVATELY MADE

00:41:05.796 --> 00:41:07.097
FIREARMS RECOVERED BY LAW

00:41:07.164 --> 00:41:08.566
ENFORCEMENT ARE BUILT FROM

00:41:08.632 --> 00:41:10.134
COMPLETE KITS PURCHASED ONLINE

00:41:10.201 --> 00:41:11.502
KITS THAT ALREADY INCLUDE

00:41:11.569 --> 00:41:14.305
BARRELS. MEANWHILE, SB 704

00:41:14.371 --> 00:41:15.806
IMPOSES STRICT REQUIREMENTS ON

00:41:15.873 --> 00:41:17.575
THE SALE OF INDIVIDUAL BARRELS,

00:41:17.641 --> 00:41:19.176
INCLUDING BACKGROUND CHECKS AND

00:41:19.243 --> 00:41:21.245
DEALER TRANSFERS, YET ADMITS

00:41:21.312 --> 00:41:22.646
THAT THE DOJ CANNOT RETAIN THE

00:41:22.713 --> 00:41:24.315
BUYER'S INFORMATION. SO EVEN

00:41:24.381 --> 00:41:25.616
UNDER THIS NEW SYSTEM, THERE'S

00:41:25.683 --> 00:41:26.717
NO WAY TO TRACK THESE BARRELS

00:41:26.784 --> 00:41:29.220
ONCE THEY'VE BEEN SOLD. BARRELS

00:41:29.286 --> 00:41:32.423
ALSO AREN'T SERIALIZED. IT

00:41:32.489 --> 00:41:33.424
CREATES PAPERWORK, NOT

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:36.360
PREVENTION. THIS BILL DOESN'T

00:41:36.427 --> 00:41:37.761
STOP CRIMINALS. IT IMPACTS THE

00:41:37.828 --> 00:41:39.930
LAW ABIDING HOBBYISTS AT HOME

00:41:39.997 --> 00:41:41.365
TRYING TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY

00:41:41.432 --> 00:41:43.167
OF THEIR RIFLE, OR SOMEONE

00:41:43.234 --> 00:41:44.335
SWAPPING A WORN BARREL ON A

00:41:44.401 --> 00:41:46.370
LEGACY FIREARM. IT TURNS SIMPLE

00:41:46.437 --> 00:41:47.705
LEGAL ACTS INTO CRIMINAL

00:41:47.771 --> 00:41:49.740
LIABILITY NOT BECAUSE OF MISUSE,

00:41:49.807 --> 00:41:51.442
BUT BECAUSE THE STATE WANTS TO

00:41:51.508 --> 00:41:52.376
MICROMANAGE GUN OWNERSHIP

00:41:52.443 --> 00:41:55.112
THROUGH REGULATION OF PARTS.

00:41:55.179 --> 00:41:55.779
CONSTITUTIONALLY, IT STILL

00:41:55.846 --> 00:41:57.581
CROSSES A LINE. THE SUPREME

00:41:57.648 --> 00:41:58.716
COURT HAS AFFIRMED THAT THE

00:41:58.782 --> 00:41:59.750
SECOND AMENDMENT PROTECTS THE

00:41:59.817 --> 00:42:00.851
RIGHT TO KEEP ARMS AND

00:42:00.918 --> 00:42:03.287
FUNCTIONING CONDITION, WHILE SB

00:42:03.354 --> 00:42:05.155
704 DOESN'T OUTRIGHT BAN

00:42:05.222 --> 00:42:06.390
BARRELS, IT IMPOSES BARRIERS

00:42:06.457 --> 00:42:07.892
THAT MAKE IT HARDER AND RISKIER

00:42:07.958 --> 00:42:10.494
FOR LAWFUL CITIZENS TO MAINTAIN,

00:42:10.561 --> 00:42:11.929
REPAIR, AND UPGRADE THEIR

00:42:11.996 --> 00:42:13.430
FIREARMS. AND THAT UNDERMINES

00:42:13.497 --> 00:42:16.667
THE RIGHT ITSELF. SB 704 IS

00:42:16.734 --> 00:42:18.035
SYMBOLIC, NOT EFFECTIVE. IT

00:42:18.102 --> 00:42:19.503
BURDENS THE WRONG PEOPLE AND

00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:21.005
SOLVES A PROBLEM THAT CALIFORNIA

00:42:21.071 --> 00:42:23.040
LAW ALREADY CLAIMS TO ADDRESS.

00:42:23.107 --> 00:42:25.276
AND AGAIN, IF CRIMINALS CAN'T BE

00:42:25.342 --> 00:42:26.744
TRACKED IN BARRELS, CAN'T BE

00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:28.178
TRACKED, THEN WHAT'S THE POINT

00:42:28.245 --> 00:42:33.217
OF THIS BILL? WE URGE A NO VOTE.

00:42:33.284 --> 00:42:34.618
MR. CHAIRMAN. MEMBERS, FORGIVE

00:42:34.685 --> 00:42:36.754
ME. IT WAS AN ADVENTURE COMING

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:39.290
IN HERE, PUTTING MY BELT ON.

00:42:39.356 --> 00:42:40.925
WHILE I'M HERE AT THE TABLE. I

00:42:40.991 --> 00:42:42.459
WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY

00:42:42.526 --> 00:42:44.328
COLLEAGUE HERE, SAM PAREDES,

00:42:44.395 --> 00:42:44.828
REPRESENTING GUN OWNERS

00:42:44.895 --> 00:42:45.863
CALIFORNIA AND NATIONAL RIFLE

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:47.331
ASSOCIATION AND THE CALIFORNIA

00:42:47.398 --> 00:42:49.400
RIFLE AND PISTOL ASSOCIATION.

00:42:49.466 --> 00:42:53.270
THE FOCUS ON BARRELS, AS OPPOSED

00:42:53.337 --> 00:42:56.607
TO THE FOCUS ON CRIMINALS IS

00:42:56.674 --> 00:42:59.810
MISGUIDED. I BELIEVE THAT THAT

00:42:59.877 --> 00:43:01.712
THIS LEGISLATURE, THIS COMMITTEE

00:43:01.779 --> 00:43:03.847
SHOULD LOOK AT THE SUCCESSES OF

00:43:03.914 --> 00:43:05.916
OAKLAND, BALTIMORE AND MANY

00:43:05.983 --> 00:43:07.751
OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE

00:43:07.818 --> 00:43:11.789
SWITCHED THEIR FOCUS FROM GUN

00:43:11.855 --> 00:43:14.325
CONTROL AS THE SOLUTION FOR THE

00:43:14.391 --> 00:43:16.560
CRIMINAL MISUSE OF FIREARMS. AS

00:43:16.627 --> 00:43:18.195
A MATTER OF FACT, WE HAVE

00:43:18.262 --> 00:43:20.297
OAKLAND THAT HAS SEEN A 45%

00:43:20.364 --> 00:43:22.199
DECREASE IN CRIMINAL MISUSE OF

00:43:22.266 --> 00:43:25.402
FIREARMS. BALTIMORE HAS SEEN A

00:43:25.469 --> 00:43:26.503
SIMILAR DECREASE. CITIES

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:29.740
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THAT ARE

00:43:29.807 --> 00:43:32.910
PRONE TO FIREARMS VIOLENCE, 35%

00:43:32.977 --> 00:43:34.478
DECREASE. AND IT IS BECAUSE THEY

00:43:34.545 --> 00:43:36.213
HAVE SWITCHED THEIR FOCUS FROM

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:39.783
GUN CONTROL TO CRIME CONTROL AND

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:41.185
FOCUSING ON THOSE WHO ARE MOST

00:43:41.251 --> 00:43:44.755
WILLING OR APT TO COMMIT A CRIME

00:43:44.822 --> 00:43:48.025
WITH A FIREARM THAT WORKS. THIS

00:43:48.092 --> 00:43:51.261
BILL WILL SERVE NO PURPOSE IN

00:43:51.328 --> 00:43:54.164
REDUCING ANY SORT OF MISUSE OF

00:43:54.231 --> 00:43:56.667
FIREARMS. CRIMINALS, AS YOU WELL

00:43:56.734 --> 00:43:58.836
KNOW, CAN ACCESS ANYTHING THEY

00:43:58.902 --> 00:44:02.172
WANT, ANYTIME THEY WANT. PERIOD.

00:44:02.239 --> 00:44:04.241
ALL OF THE LAWS IN THE WORLD ARE

00:44:04.308 --> 00:44:04.875
NOT GOING TO PREVENT THEM FROM

00:44:04.942 --> 00:44:06.510
DOING THAT. THIS BILL ONLY

00:44:06.577 --> 00:44:07.945
AFFECTS LAW ABIDING CITIZENS WHO

00:44:08.012 --> 00:44:09.813
WANT NOTHING MORE THAN TO

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.548
UPGRADE OR REPAIR THEIR GUNS.

00:44:11.615 --> 00:44:13.584
AND NOW THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:15.019
ANOTHER HOOP, WHICH WE BELIEVE

00:44:15.085 --> 00:44:16.253
TO BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL. FOR

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.222
THESE REASONS, WE ARE STRONGLY

00:44:18.288 --> 00:44:20.524
OPPOSED TO THIS MEASURE. THANK

00:44:20.591 --> 00:44:21.358
YOU, GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU BOTH

00:44:21.425 --> 00:44:23.060
FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. WE'LL TAKE

00:44:23.127 --> 00:44:24.628
ANY OTHER METOOS IN THE ROOM. IF

00:44:24.695 --> 00:44:26.196
YOU'RE OPPOSED TO THE MEASURE,

00:44:26.263 --> 00:44:27.197
PLEASE COME FORWARD. NAME,

00:44:27.264 --> 00:44:28.365
ORGANIZATION AND POSITION,

00:44:28.432 --> 00:44:30.267
PLEASE. LESLIE CALDWELL,

HOUSTON, CALIFORNIA. PUBLIC

THANK THE AUTHOR, THE SENATOR.

00:44:36.306 --> 00:44:38.542
THANK YOU. AND THE COMMITTEE. WE

00:44:38.609 --> 00:44:43.113
ARE WITHDRAWING OUR OPPOSITION.

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:44.448
AUBRY RODRIGUEZ WITH ACLU

00:44:44.515 --> 00:44:45.649
CALIFORNIA ACTION. JUST REAL

00:44:45.716 --> 00:44:47.418
QUICK, WANT TO SAY THAT WE

00:44:47.484 --> 00:44:48.385
APPRECIATE THE SENATOR AND THE

00:44:48.452 --> 00:44:49.720
STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US, AND

00:44:49.787 --> 00:44:51.488
WE HOPE TO EVENTUALLY REMOVE

00:44:51.555 --> 00:44:52.689
THAT WOBBLER AND THEN HOPEFULLY

00:44:52.756 --> 00:44:53.857
REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION. BUT RIGHT

00:44:53.924 --> 00:44:55.292
NOW, AS IN PRINT, WE ARE

00:44:55.359 --> 00:44:57.127
OPPOSED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU

00:44:57.194 --> 00:44:58.495
VERY MUCH. FINAL CALL. ANYONE

00:44:58.562 --> 00:45:01.165
ELSE HOPING TO BE HEARD ON THE

00:45:01.231 --> 00:45:02.466
MATTER? SEEING NONE, I WILL TURN

00:45:02.533 --> 00:45:03.500
IT OVER TO THE DAIS FOR ANY

00:45:03.567 --> 00:45:05.502
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ANY

00:45:05.569 --> 00:45:07.237
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM

00:45:07.304 --> 00:45:09.706
COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY. SEEING

00:45:09.773 --> 00:45:11.141
NONE. SENATOR, WOULD YOU LIKE TO

00:45:11.208 --> 00:45:12.276
CLOSE AND PERHAPS I'LL PITCH YOU

00:45:12.342 --> 00:45:13.610
A QUESTION FOR AID OF CLOSING.

00:45:13.677 --> 00:45:15.379
YOU HEARD SOME CONCERNS RAISED

00:45:15.446 --> 00:45:16.947
BY THE OPPOSITION. IF YOU HAVE

00:45:17.014 --> 00:45:18.182
ANY RESPONSE FOR THE COMMITTEE,

00:45:18.248 --> 00:45:19.883
THIS WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:20.484
TIME. I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY

00:45:20.551 --> 00:45:22.753
THAT THIS BILL IS NOT INTENDED

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:23.654
TO BURDEN LAW ABIDING CITIZENS

00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:24.755
WHO GO THROUGH THE BACKGROUND

00:45:24.822 --> 00:45:27.091
PROCESS TO LEGALLY PURCHASE A

00:45:27.157 --> 00:45:28.659
GUN. WE HAVE EXEMPTED LAW

00:45:28.725 --> 00:45:29.860
ENFORCEMENT, MILITARY AND

00:45:29.927 --> 00:45:30.928
PERSONS UNDERGOING A BACKGROUND

00:45:30.994 --> 00:45:34.131
CHECK. AND THIS IS A REAL ISSUE,

00:45:34.198 --> 00:45:35.699
AND THIS IS A SOLUTION TO SOLVE

00:45:35.766 --> 00:45:38.402
A REAL ISSUE. AS I SAID, 592%

00:45:38.469 --> 00:45:40.037
INCREASE IN GHOST GUNS RECOVERED

00:45:40.104 --> 00:45:42.206
IN CALIFORNIA REPRESENT 70% OF

00:45:42.272 --> 00:45:44.274
THE GUNS RECOVERED BY LAW

00:45:44.341 --> 00:45:45.476
ENFORCEMENT. AND SO THE MORE WE

00:45:45.542 --> 00:45:47.911
CAN TRY TO MAKE IT MORE

00:45:47.978 --> 00:45:50.781
DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO

00:45:50.848 --> 00:45:52.549
CONSTRUCT THESE ILLEGAL GUNS, WE

00:45:52.616 --> 00:45:54.852
CAN REDUCE THE HARM THAT'S BEING

00:45:54.918 --> 00:45:55.419
INFLICTED ON COMMUNITIES IN

00:45:55.486 --> 00:45:56.487
CALIFORNIA. WITH THAT, I

00:45:56.553 --> 00:45:57.588
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE.

00:45:57.654 --> 00:45:59.389
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SENATOR.

00:45:59.456 --> 00:46:00.424
COLLEAGUES, THE CHAIR IS

00:46:00.491 --> 00:46:01.625
RECOMMENDING AND I APPRECIATE

00:46:01.692 --> 00:46:03.293
THE WORK OF THE AUTHOR. WE DO

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.661
NOT YET HAVE A QUORUM, SO WE'LL

00:46:04.728 --> 00:46:06.263
LET YOU KNOW THE OUTCOME.

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:07.531
SENATOR, THANK YOU, EVERYONE FOR

00:46:07.598 --> 00:46:08.532
BEING HERE. WE'LL TAKE THE

00:46:08.599 --> 00:46:10.567
MOTION AND VOTE LATER. NEXT, I

00:46:10.634 --> 00:46:11.535
SEE THAT SENATOR WAHAB HAS

00:46:11.602 --> 00:46:12.703
ARRIVED, SO WE'LL BE MOVING TO

00:46:12.769 --> 00:46:14.037
ITEM NUMBER SIX. COLLEAGUES,

00:46:14.104 --> 00:46:16.373
THIS IS SENATE BILL 258. I WILL

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.208
NOTE THAT I ALSO SEE SENATOR

00:46:18.275 --> 00:46:20.310
UMBERG IN THE ROOM. SO AS SOON

00:46:20.377 --> 00:46:21.645
AS WE'RE DONE WITH SENATOR

00:46:21.712 --> 00:46:22.646
WAHAB, WE'LL MOVE TO SENATOR

00:46:22.713 --> 00:46:23.580
UMBERG. AFTER THAT, I BELIEVE

00:46:23.647 --> 00:46:25.082
SENATOR HURTADO IS THE NEXT IN

00:46:25.149 --> 00:46:26.483
THE QUEUE. IF YOU HAVE NOT YET

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:28.252
SIGNED IT AND YOU'RE AN AUTHOR,

00:46:28.318 --> 00:46:30.053
PLEASE COME ON DOWN. SENATOR

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.688
WAHAB, WHEN YOU'RE READY, THE

00:46:31.755 --> 00:46:40.797
FLOOR IS YOURS. ALL RIGHT. SO,

00:46:40.864 --> 00:46:42.166
CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS, I

00:46:42.232 --> 00:46:45.202
WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR

00:46:45.269 --> 00:46:48.305
PATIENCE. SB 258 CLOSES THE LAST

00:46:48.372 --> 00:46:50.474
SPOUSAL RAPE LOOPHOLE IN

00:46:50.541 --> 00:46:52.910
CALIFORNIA LAW. THIS BILL IS A

00:46:52.976 --> 00:46:54.011
LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS

00:46:54.077 --> 00:46:56.146
PRIORITY BILL. CURRENTLY, OUR

00:46:56.213 --> 00:46:58.482
LAW PERMITS THE RAPE OF A SPOUSE

00:46:58.549 --> 00:47:00.817
WHO IS UNABLE TO CONSENT DUE TO

00:47:00.884 --> 00:47:02.319
A DISABILITY, WHILE THE SAME ACT

00:47:02.386 --> 00:47:03.787
OF RAPE COMMITTED BY AN

00:47:03.854 --> 00:47:06.690
UNMARRIED PARTNER IS A CRIME,

00:47:06.757 --> 00:47:07.991
DISABILITY CAN IMPEDE PEOPLE'S

00:47:08.058 --> 00:47:09.893
ABILITY TO CONSENT, WHETHER IT'S

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:11.728
BECAUSE OF AN INTELLECTUAL OR

00:47:11.795 --> 00:47:12.930
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY OR AN

00:47:12.996 --> 00:47:14.531
AGE RELATED DISEASE LIKE

00:47:14.598 --> 00:47:17.000
ALZHEIMER'S OR DEMENTIA. ANYONE

00:47:17.067 --> 00:47:18.569
WHO KNOWINGLY TAKES ADVANTAGE OF

00:47:18.635 --> 00:47:21.171
A PERSON WHEN THEY ARE UNABLE TO

00:47:21.238 --> 00:47:23.273
CONSENT TO SEX BECAUSE OF THEIR

00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:26.143
DISABILITY IS A RAPIST, WHICH IS

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:27.945
WHY NO OTHER PART OF THE PENAL

00:47:28.011 --> 00:47:29.379
CODE REGARDING SEX CRIMES

00:47:29.446 --> 00:47:31.215
AGAINST PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES

00:47:31.281 --> 00:47:33.016
EXEMPTS SPOUSES FROM THE

00:47:33.083 --> 00:47:35.886
DEFINITION. RAPE IS RAPE. WE

00:47:35.953 --> 00:47:37.221
NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE

00:47:37.287 --> 00:47:38.322
PROTECTING THE MOST VULNERABLE

00:47:38.388 --> 00:47:41.258
AMONG US. 42 OTHER STATES HAVE

00:47:41.325 --> 00:47:43.393
ALREADY ELIMINATED SPOUSAL RAPE

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:45.128
EXCEPTIONS, AND CALIFORNIA IS

00:47:45.195 --> 00:47:47.264
LONG OVERDUE TO FOLLOW SUIT.

00:47:47.331 --> 00:47:50.234
THIS BILL WOULD ENSURE THAT

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:51.635
PERPETRATORS WHO RAPE THEIR

00:47:51.702 --> 00:47:53.203
SPOUSES WHEN THEY ARE UNABLE TO

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:54.571
CONSENT BECAUSE OF A DISABILITY

00:47:54.638 --> 00:47:57.207
WOULD FACE JUSTICE HERE TODAY IN

00:47:57.274 --> 00:47:59.610
SUPPORT OF SB 258 OR TERRI

00:47:59.676 --> 00:48:00.711

REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES, OR AKA

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:12.522
A NETWORK OF 21 COMMUNITY

00:48:12.589 --> 00:48:14.725

400,000 INDIVIDUALS WITH

00:48:16.193 --> 00:48:24.401
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. GOOD

00:48:24.468 --> 00:48:26.570
MORNING. ON BEHALF OF DISTRICT

00:48:26.637 --> 00:48:28.438
ATTORNEY JEFF ROSEN, THE SANTA

00:48:28.505 --> 00:48:30.641
CLARA COUNTY DA'S OFFICE IS IN

00:48:30.707 --> 00:48:32.609
SUPPORT OF SB 258. MY NAME IS

00:48:32.676 --> 00:48:34.478
TERRY HARMON. I'M AN ASSISTANT

00:48:34.544 --> 00:48:37.547
DA. I OVERSEE OUR SEXUAL ASSAULT

00:48:37.614 --> 00:48:40.217
UNIT. THERE CAN BE MANY DEFENSES

00:48:40.284 --> 00:48:43.854
TO AN ALLEGATION OF RAPE. I AM

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:46.356
MARRIED TO THE PERPETRATOR. I AM

00:48:46.423 --> 00:48:47.624
MARRIED TO THE VICTIM. SHOULD

00:48:47.691 --> 00:48:50.694
NOT BE ONE OF THEM. FAR MORE

00:48:50.761 --> 00:48:52.796
PEOPLE ARE VULNERABLE TO SEXUAL

00:48:52.863 --> 00:48:55.499
ASSAULT BECAUSE OF THIS LOOPHOLE

00:48:55.565 --> 00:48:58.935
THAN IF WE GET RID OF IT. THE

00:48:59.002 --> 00:49:00.771
LEGISLATURE HAS ALREADY

00:49:00.837 --> 00:49:03.273
DETERMINED THAT IT IS UNLAWFUL

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:04.708
TO HAVE SEXUAL INTERCOURSE WITH

00:49:04.775 --> 00:49:07.177
SOMEONE WHO CANNOT CONSENT,

00:49:07.244 --> 00:49:08.745
WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE THIS

00:49:08.812 --> 00:49:11.548
SECTION IN THE FIRST PLACE. WHY

00:49:11.615 --> 00:49:13.884
DOES BEING MARRIED MAKE THIS

00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:18.021
ILLEGAL ACT LEGAL? THE ABILITY

00:49:18.088 --> 00:49:19.523
TO CONSENT IS NOT A PERMANENT

00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:22.059
LABEL FOR ANY OF US. IT IS NOT

00:49:22.125 --> 00:49:24.194
STATIC OR UNCHANGING. IT IS

00:49:24.261 --> 00:49:27.030
FLUID. PEOPLE CAN BE BORN WITH

00:49:27.097 --> 00:49:28.131
DISABILITIES AND PEOPLE CAN

00:49:28.198 --> 00:49:31.702
BECOME DISABLED THROUGH AGE.

00:49:31.768 --> 00:49:33.003
ALZHEIMER'S, LOU GEHRIG'S PEOPLE

00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:34.638
CAN SUFFER TRAUMATIC BRAIN

00:49:34.705 --> 00:49:37.140
INJURY DUE TO A CAR ACCIDENT.

00:49:37.207 --> 00:49:40.010
WHETHER SOMEONE IS CAPABLE OF

00:49:40.077 --> 00:49:42.145
CONSENTING TO SEXUAL INTERCOURSE

00:49:42.212 --> 00:49:45.182
MUST BE EVALUATED IN CONJUNCTION

00:49:45.248 --> 00:49:47.517
WITH THE EVENT ITSELF AND THE

00:49:47.584 --> 00:49:50.087
SURROUNDING CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS

00:49:50.153 --> 00:49:52.989
BILL DOES NOT CRIMINALIZE

00:49:53.056 --> 00:49:56.226
CONSENSUAL SEX. THIS BILL ALLOWS

00:49:56.293 --> 00:49:58.729
DISABLED PEOPLE TO HAVE AGENCY

00:49:58.795 --> 00:50:00.931
OVER THEIR LIVES AND TO HAVE SEX

00:50:00.997 --> 00:50:02.799
WHEN THEY WANT, AND NOT TO HAVE

00:50:02.866 --> 00:50:04.935
IT THRUST UPON THEM WHEN THEY

00:50:05.001 --> 00:50:08.138
DON'T. BECAUSE PART OF SEX LIFE

00:50:08.205 --> 00:50:10.240
CONTROL IS THE RIGHT TO SAY NO,

00:50:10.307 --> 00:50:12.743
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU ARE

00:50:12.809 --> 00:50:15.212
MARRIED TO THAT PERSON. WE

00:50:15.278 --> 00:50:17.114
PROSECUTE ACTS OF RAPE STEMMING

00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:19.349
FROM ALL SORTS OF SITUATIONS AND

00:50:19.416 --> 00:50:22.085
WITHIN THE CONFINES OF DIFFERENT

00:50:22.152 --> 00:50:24.354
RELATIONSHIPS. STRANGER DATING,

00:50:24.421 --> 00:50:27.591
LIFE PARTNER, SPOUSE. RAPE IS AN

00:50:27.657 --> 00:50:30.394
ACT OF VIOLENCE. IT OFTEN LEAVES

00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:32.863
PHYSICAL WOUNDS AND ALWAYS

00:50:32.929 --> 00:50:35.465
INFLICTS EMOTIONAL TRAUMA. AND

00:50:35.532 --> 00:50:37.200
RAPE IS RAPE, REGARDLESS OF THE

00:50:37.267 --> 00:50:39.536
MARITAL STATUS BETWEEN THE TWO

00:50:39.603 --> 00:50:42.305
PARTIES. AND IT IS TIME THAT

00:50:42.372 --> 00:50:43.707
CALIFORNIA LAW REFLECTS THAT.

00:50:43.774 --> 00:50:47.244
THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING. GOOD

00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:48.945
MORNING CHAIR. MORNING, MEMBERS.

00:50:49.012 --> 00:50:50.480
TONY ANDERSEN, ASSOCIATION OF

00:50:50.547 --> 00:50:52.182
REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES FOR

00:50:52.249 --> 00:50:53.850
OVER 54 YEARS NOW, REGIONAL

00:50:53.917 --> 00:50:55.585
CENTERS HAVE SERVED CALIFORNIANS

00:50:55.652 --> 00:50:57.120
WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES

00:50:57.187 --> 00:50:58.588
THROUGHOUT THEIR ENTIRE LIVES.

00:50:58.655 --> 00:51:00.357
OUR CENTRAL CHARGE OF THE

00:51:00.424 --> 00:51:01.458
REGIONAL CENTERS IS TO HELP

00:51:01.525 --> 00:51:02.893
PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL

00:51:02.959 --> 00:51:04.194
DISABILITIES TO BECOME FULL

00:51:04.261 --> 00:51:05.395
PARTICIPANTS IN THEIR

00:51:05.462 --> 00:51:06.997
COMMUNITIES, FREE OF

00:51:07.063 --> 00:51:09.232
SEGREGATION. THE CENTER'S FIGHT

00:51:09.299 --> 00:51:10.801
ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR THE HUMAN

00:51:10.867 --> 00:51:12.469
AND CIVIL RIGHTS OF PEOPLE WITH

00:51:12.536 --> 00:51:13.703
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES TO

00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:15.472
HAVE ACCESS TO EVERY FACET OF A

00:51:15.539 --> 00:51:17.307
PERSON'S LIFE, LIKE ANYONE ELSE

00:51:17.374 --> 00:51:18.875
WITHOUT A DISABILITY. WHILE IT

00:51:18.942 --> 00:51:20.510
IS TRUE THAT PEOPLE WITH

00:51:20.577 --> 00:51:21.478
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES HAVE

00:51:21.545 --> 00:51:24.014
UNIQUE NEEDS, THEY ALSO HAVE THE

00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:25.816
SAME NEEDS AS ANYONE ELSE, AND

00:51:25.882 --> 00:51:27.350
THIS INCLUDES THE NEED TO HAVE A

00:51:27.417 --> 00:51:29.019
FRIENDSHIPS, INTIMATE

00:51:29.085 --> 00:51:30.987
RELATIONSHIPS, AND MARRIAGE.

00:51:31.054 --> 00:51:32.656
UNFORTUNATELY, IF THEY CHOOSE TO

00:51:32.722 --> 00:51:34.458
GET MARRIED. CURRENT LAW.

00:51:34.524 --> 00:51:36.259
CURRENT LAW MAKES THEM MORE

00:51:36.326 --> 00:51:37.661
VULNERABLE TO SPOUSAL RAPE AND

00:51:37.727 --> 00:51:39.529
SEXUAL ASSAULT. AND THIS IS NOT

00:51:39.596 --> 00:51:40.997
FAIR OR EQUAL TREATMENT OF

00:51:41.064 --> 00:51:42.833
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. IF ANY

00:51:42.899 --> 00:51:44.601
GROUP SHOULD HAVE ADDITIONAL

00:51:44.668 --> 00:51:45.669
PROTECTIONS, IT SHOULD BE PEOPLE

00:51:45.735 --> 00:51:47.337
WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES.

00:51:47.404 --> 00:51:49.272
IT HAS BEEN WELL ESTABLISHED FOR

00:51:49.339 --> 00:51:50.407
DECADES THAT PEOPLE WITH

00:51:50.474 --> 00:51:51.775
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES ARE

00:51:51.842 --> 00:51:53.510
VICTIMS OF RAPE AND SEXUAL

00:51:53.577 --> 00:51:56.480
ASSAULT AT RATES 4 TO 10 TIMES

00:51:56.546 --> 00:51:58.315
HIGHER, AND MORE FREQUENTLY THAN

00:51:58.381 --> 00:52:00.116
PEOPLE WITHOUT DISABILITIES.

00:52:00.183 --> 00:52:01.017
THERE ARE MANY FACTORS THAT

00:52:01.084 --> 00:52:02.886
CONTRIBUTE TO THE HIGHER RATES.

00:52:02.953 --> 00:52:05.188
SOME ARE THE PERCEPTIONS BY

00:52:05.255 --> 00:52:07.157
PERPETRATORS THAT THE VICTIM

00:52:07.224 --> 00:52:09.059
WILL NOT BE A GOOD WITNESS IN

00:52:09.125 --> 00:52:11.228
COURT. THEY'RE THEY'RE MORE

00:52:11.294 --> 00:52:13.663
TRUSTING AND THAT THE SOMETIMES

00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:14.998
THEY'RE IN A POWER POSITION

00:52:15.065 --> 00:52:16.266
WHERE THEY'RE DEPENDENT ON THEIR

00:52:16.333 --> 00:52:17.968
FOOD, HEALTH, MEDICINE AND

00:52:18.034 --> 00:52:19.903
HOUSING, JUST TO NAME A FEW. THE

00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:21.738
BIGGEST CHALLENGE OF SEXUAL

00:52:21.805 --> 00:52:23.106
ASSAULT AGAINST PEOPLE WITH

00:52:23.173 --> 00:52:24.875
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES IS

00:52:24.941 --> 00:52:26.209
THAT IS THAT THE CRIMINAL

00:52:26.276 --> 00:52:28.612
JUSTICE SYSTEM DOES NOT PURSUE

00:52:28.678 --> 00:52:30.680
THE JUSTICE POPULATION FOR THIS

00:52:30.747 --> 00:52:32.916
POPULATION EQUITABLY. SOMEBODY

00:52:32.983 --> 00:52:34.584
HAS TO STAND UP FOR VICTIMS WITH

00:52:34.651 --> 00:52:35.719
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND

00:52:35.785 --> 00:52:36.920
FORCE THE JUSTICE SYSTEM TO

00:52:36.987 --> 00:52:38.255

00:52:44.427 --> 00:52:46.363
THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE SHOULD

00:52:46.429 --> 00:52:48.031

EXCEPTION ON THE BOOKS TODAY IS

00:52:53.403 --> 00:52:54.738
CLEARLY A CRIME TO COMMIT RAPE

00:52:54.804 --> 00:52:56.139
AGAINST AN UNMARRIED PERSON WITH

00:52:56.206 --> 00:52:57.674

DISABILITIES. IF THE VICTIM IS

00:53:13.690 --> 00:53:16.026
THE SPOUSE OF THE OFFENDER. SO

00:53:16.092 --> 00:53:19.162
SB 258 DECLARES RAPE IS RAPE

00:53:19.229 --> 00:53:21.731

EVERYBODY STAFF ON THIS

00:55:45.542 --> 00:55:46.910
COMMITTEE, THE CALIFORNIA CODE

STANDARD, APPELLATE COURTS

ONE APPELLATE COURT NOTED, THE

00:56:15.371 --> 00:56:17.107

PEOPLE TO HAVE CONSENSUAL SEX.

00:56:21.144 --> 00:56:24.214
SB 238 WOULD NOT UPDATE THESE

00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:26.349
OUTDATED UNDERSTANDINGS OF

EXPAND THEM TO MARRIED DISABLED

00:56:32.655 --> 00:56:34.791

00:56:34.858 --> 00:56:36.893
THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT

00:56:42.065 --> 00:56:43.700
NOT ABOUT SITUATIONS IN WHICH A

INTIMATE RELATIONSHIPS OF THEIR

00:57:09.159 --> 00:57:11.761
OWN CHOOSING. IT'S FRUSTRATING

00:57:11.828 --> 00:57:13.329
TO BE HERE WITH THIS BILL THAT

00:57:13.396 --> 00:57:15.465

00:57:21.971 --> 00:57:22.972
FRUSTRATING. IT'S BEEN A

TERRIBLE MONTH FOR ALL OF US.

00:57:24.841 --> 00:57:26.176

00:59:26.396 --> 00:59:28.331
ON THE BILL. ALL RIGHT. WELL,

00:59:28.398 --> 00:59:29.732
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR YOUR

00:59:29.799 --> 00:59:31.801
TESTIMONY TODAY. WE'LL NOW TURN

00:59:31.868 --> 00:59:32.468
IT OVER TO THE DAIS. WOULD

00:59:32.535 --> 00:59:34.437
ANYONE LIKE TO GET US STARTED,

00:59:34.504 --> 00:59:38.341
MR. LACKEY? YEAH. I THINK THIS

00:59:38.408 --> 00:59:40.143
IS A VERY, VERY CRITICAL TOPIC,

00:59:40.209 --> 00:59:42.278
AND IT'S ONE THAT I FEEL VERY

00:59:42.345 --> 00:59:46.616
ATTACHED TO. AND ONE OF THE VERY

00:59:46.683 --> 00:59:48.484
DELICATE ISSUES, BUT DESERVES

00:59:48.551 --> 00:59:51.321
FURTHER DISCUSSION IS THE

00:59:51.387 --> 00:59:53.489
OPPOSITION HAS INDICATED THEIR

00:59:53.556 --> 00:59:55.325
CONCERN OVER THE CAPACITY TO

00:59:55.391 --> 00:59:57.427
CONSENT. AND IT IS A VERY, VERY

00:59:57.493 --> 00:59:59.228
CRITICAL ISSUE. I DON'T KNOW IF

00:59:59.295 --> 01:00:01.464
ANY OF YOU HAVE EVER SEEN THE

01:00:01.531 --> 01:00:04.267
PROGRAM LOVE ON THE SPECTRUM. IT

01:00:04.334 --> 01:00:06.469
TALKS ABOUT PEOPLE ON THE

01:00:06.536 --> 01:00:08.604
SPECTRUM WHO ARE ENGAGING IN

01:00:08.671 --> 01:00:10.773
RELATIONSHIPS. AND IF YOU

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.208
HAVEN'T SEEN IT, I HIGHLY

01:00:12.275 --> 01:00:13.343
RECOMMEND YOU WATCH AT LEAST A

01:00:13.409 --> 01:00:14.677
COUPLE EPISODES. YOU'LL PROBABLY

01:00:14.744 --> 01:00:17.313
GET HOOKED, BUT I WILL TELL YOU

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:20.016
THAT THIS IS A REAL THING, AND I

01:00:20.083 --> 01:00:23.219
THINK A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE WHO

01:00:23.286 --> 01:00:26.189
ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH PEOPLE THAT

01:00:26.255 --> 01:00:28.825
HAVE DISABILITIES DO NOT

01:00:28.891 --> 01:00:30.126
UNDERSTAND THE FACT THAT THERE

01:00:30.193 --> 01:00:32.395
ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT ARE

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:33.396
EVIDENCE OF IMPAIRMENT, AND

01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:35.598
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT

01:00:35.665 --> 01:00:37.000
PROVE THAT THERE IS NO

01:00:37.066 --> 01:00:38.868
IMPAIRMENT. AND EMOTION IS ONE

01:00:38.935 --> 01:00:41.337
OF THOSE MEASURING PIECES THAT

01:00:41.404 --> 01:00:44.374
OFTEN HAVE LIMITED TO NO

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:47.043
IMPAIRMENT. AND THEY LINK THE

01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:49.679
ABILITY TO CONSENT WITH THEIR

01:00:49.746 --> 01:00:51.948
OTHER DISABILITY. AND I THINK

01:00:52.015 --> 01:00:54.617
THAT THAT'S A VERY, VERY

01:00:54.684 --> 01:00:57.086
DANGEROUS PATHWAY. IF I COULD

01:00:57.153 --> 01:00:59.455
HAVE THE AUTHOR KIND OF CLARIFY

01:00:59.522 --> 01:01:01.624
THIS CAPACITY TO CONSENT AND HOW

01:01:01.691 --> 01:01:02.658
HER BILL ADDRESSES THAT.

01:01:02.725 --> 01:01:05.194
DEFINITELY. SO, AND I APPRECIATE

01:01:05.261 --> 01:01:06.963
THAT. I APPRECIATE ALL THE

01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:09.532
CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED. FIRST

01:01:09.599 --> 01:01:12.702
AND FOREMOST, THIS IS A VERY

01:01:12.769 --> 01:01:14.070
NARROW, TIGHTLY TARGETED BILL

01:01:14.137 --> 01:01:16.439
THAT SIMPLY REMOVES A SENTENCE

01:01:16.506 --> 01:01:18.508
FROM THE PENAL CODE IN ORDER TO

01:01:18.574 --> 01:01:19.776
ELIMINATE THE SPOUSAL RAPE

01:01:19.842 --> 01:01:22.278
EXCEPTION, RIGHT. ANY AMENDMENT

01:01:22.345 --> 01:01:24.247
TO THE DEFINITION OF CONSENT,

01:01:24.313 --> 01:01:25.581
INCLUDING A PRESUMPTION THAT

01:01:25.648 --> 01:01:27.450
EVERYONE IS COMPETENT OVER 18,

01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:29.318
COULD CREATE PROBLEMS FOR CASES

01:01:29.385 --> 01:01:31.287
INVOLVING ALCOHOL AND

01:01:31.354 --> 01:01:33.022
UNCONSCIOUSNESS. THAT IS ONE OF

01:01:33.089 --> 01:01:34.357
THE REASONS WHY WE ARE CONCERNED

01:01:34.424 --> 01:01:38.027
WITH CAPACITY. NO STATE IN THE

01:01:38.094 --> 01:01:39.829
UNITED STATES HAS THE KIND OF

01:01:39.896 --> 01:01:41.164
CAPACITY CRITERIA THAT THE

01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:43.666
OPPONENTS ARE SEEKING HERE. ALL

01:01:43.733 --> 01:01:45.768
OTHER STATES USE SOME VARIANT OF

01:01:45.835 --> 01:01:47.336
CALIFORNIA LAW, WHICH IS

01:01:47.403 --> 01:01:48.805
UNDERSTANDING THE NATURE OF THE

01:01:48.871 --> 01:01:50.006
ACT, ALTHOUGH THE OPPONENTS

01:01:50.073 --> 01:01:51.874
CLAIM THAT ESTABLISHING A

01:01:51.941 --> 01:01:53.042
DEFINITION OF CAPACITY IS

01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:55.244
DIFFERENT FROM CONSENT. IN FACT,

01:01:55.311 --> 01:01:58.214
THEY ARE ONE THING WITH ONE

01:01:58.281 --> 01:02:00.183
TEST. LACK OF CAPACITY MEANS

01:02:00.249 --> 01:02:02.051
INABILITY TO DO THE THINGS IN

01:02:02.118 --> 01:02:05.788
260 1.6 THAT ARE REQUIRED TO

01:02:05.855 --> 01:02:06.923
CONSENT, UNDERSTAND THE NATURE

01:02:06.989 --> 01:02:08.891
OF THE ACT OR TRANSACTION, AND

01:02:08.958 --> 01:02:11.694
ACT VOLUNTARILY. THE PROPER WAY

01:02:11.761 --> 01:02:13.296
TO HANDLE THIS IS WITH A

01:02:13.362 --> 01:02:15.731
DEFINITION IN 261. THERE IS NO

01:02:15.798 --> 01:02:17.500
REASON TO TOUCH THE OTHER

01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:18.901
STATUTE, SINCE THOSE LAWS DO NOT

01:02:18.968 --> 01:02:22.138
HAVE SPOUSAL RAPE EXCEPTIONS.

01:02:22.205 --> 01:02:23.239
PRESUMABLY THE REASON WE ARE

01:02:23.306 --> 01:02:24.707
ADDING SOME THINGS TO THE BILL

01:02:24.774 --> 01:02:26.542
IS THAT THEY ARE RESPONSIVE TO

01:02:26.609 --> 01:02:28.377
THE CONCERN WITH THE BILL.

01:02:28.444 --> 01:02:29.011
REGARDING THE EXCEPTION, THESE

01:02:29.078 --> 01:02:30.446
OTHER OFFENSES DO NOT HAVE SUCH

01:02:30.513 --> 01:02:32.281
AN EXEMPTION, SO THERE'S NO

01:02:32.348 --> 01:02:34.383
REASON TO TOUCH THEM. THIS IS,

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:36.619
AGAIN, A VERY NARROW AND TIGHT

01:02:36.686 --> 01:02:39.422
BILL SPECIFICALLY TO REMOVE THE

01:02:39.489 --> 01:02:41.924
SPOUSAL EXCEPTION IN RAPE.

01:02:41.991 --> 01:02:43.459
CALIFORNIA WOULD BE THE ONLY

01:02:43.526 --> 01:02:44.894
STATE WITH SUCH A LAW. SO THERE

01:02:44.961 --> 01:02:46.996
ARE NO MODELS WE CAN LOOK INTO

01:02:47.063 --> 01:02:48.464
IN ORDER TO SEE THEIR

01:02:48.531 --> 01:02:50.600
EXPERIENCES. SPOUSAL RAPE

01:02:50.666 --> 01:02:52.602
EXCEPTIONS ARE AN ARCHAIC LEGACY

01:02:52.668 --> 01:02:54.504
OF THE 17TH CENTURY ENGLISH

01:02:54.570 --> 01:02:56.372
COMMON LAW THAT HAVE NO PLACE IN

01:02:56.439 --> 01:02:58.674
MODERN PENAL CODE. WHATEVER

01:02:58.741 --> 01:02:59.876
PROBLEM THE OPPOSITION IS TRYING

01:02:59.942 --> 01:03:01.110
TO SOLVE, THE SPOUSAL RAPE

01:03:01.177 --> 01:03:04.580
EXCEPTION IS NOT THE ANSWER. AND

01:03:04.647 --> 01:03:07.550
I'M ALSO HAPPY TO SAY THAT WE.

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:09.585
THIS BILL CAME ABOUT FROM OUR

01:03:09.652 --> 01:03:11.821
DISTRICT, FROM INDIVIDUALS THAT

01:03:11.888 --> 01:03:13.956
ARE DISABLED, THAT WERE RAPED BY

01:03:14.023 --> 01:03:17.226
THEIR SPOUSE. THEY ARE TOO

01:03:17.293 --> 01:03:18.928
AFRAID TO COME UP AND TESTIFY.

01:03:18.995 --> 01:03:20.163
BUT THEY SHARED THEIR STORIES

01:03:20.229 --> 01:03:24.000
AND THEY TOLD ME TO MENTION THAT

01:03:24.066 --> 01:03:26.302
BECAUSE THESE ARE REAL LIFE

01:03:26.369 --> 01:03:27.770
PEOPLE WITH THESE EXPERIENCES

01:03:27.837 --> 01:03:29.872
THAT WERE NOT ABLE TO GO AFTER

01:03:29.939 --> 01:03:32.241
THEIR SPOUSE, THEY EVENTUALLY

01:03:32.308 --> 01:03:34.243
DIVORCED THEIR SPOUSE WITH A LOT

01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:35.912
OF HELP AND SUPPORT FROM

01:03:35.978 --> 01:03:38.181
COMMUNITY, BUT THEY WERE NOT

01:03:38.247 --> 01:03:39.916
ABLE TO GET THE JUSTICE THAT

01:03:39.982 --> 01:03:41.484
PEOPLE GET WHEN THEY'RE NOT

01:03:41.551 --> 01:03:43.486
MARRIED AND SOMEBODY RAPES THEM.

01:03:43.553 --> 01:03:46.455
EVERY SINGLE CASE LAW THAT WAS

01:03:46.522 --> 01:03:49.625
IN CONVERSATION WITH OPPOSITION

01:03:49.692 --> 01:03:52.428
ABOUT SPOUSAL RAPE AND ALL THE

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:53.663
POTENTIAL HARM THAT IT COULD DO

01:03:53.729 --> 01:03:56.098
IF WE REMOVE THIS EXEMPTION, IS

01:03:56.165 --> 01:03:57.900
NOT ACCURATE. EVERY SINGLE CASE

01:03:57.967 --> 01:04:00.436
LAW THAT THEY SHOWED WAS A

01:04:00.503 --> 01:04:02.438
PARATRANSIT DRIVER THAT RAPED

01:04:02.505 --> 01:04:06.475
THEIR CLIENT, WAS A CAREGIVER

01:04:06.542 --> 01:04:08.077
THAT RAPED THEIR CLIENT. AGAIN,

01:04:08.144 --> 01:04:10.546
NOTHING TO DO WITH MARRIAGE. AND

01:04:10.613 --> 01:04:13.115
WE HAVE PROFESSIONALS THAT HAVE

01:04:13.182 --> 01:04:16.085
WORKED AND CLEARLY SHOW THAT IN

01:04:16.152 --> 01:04:17.520
THE JUDGE'S DISCRETION AND MUCH

01:04:17.587 --> 01:04:20.189
MORE, THAT WE ARE, AGAIN, JUST

01:04:20.256 --> 01:04:23.526
TRYING TO PROVIDE MORE SUPPORT

01:04:23.593 --> 01:04:26.529
FOR VICTIMS IN MARRIAGES. THAT

01:04:26.596 --> 01:04:29.498
IS ALL. AND FOR THE LEGAL, YOU

01:04:29.565 --> 01:04:31.367
KNOW, ASPECT AND TECHNICAL

01:04:31.434 --> 01:04:33.202
DEFINITION, I'D LOVE TO DEFER TO

01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:36.038
MY WITNESS HERE. YES. GOOD

01:04:36.105 --> 01:04:40.176
MORNING. CALCRIM DEFINES THE

01:04:40.243 --> 01:04:42.578
ABILITY TO CONSENT IS THAT A

01:04:42.645 --> 01:04:45.381
PERSON MUST ACT FREELY AND

01:04:45.448 --> 01:04:47.216
VOLUNTARILY AND KNOW THE NATURE

01:04:47.283 --> 01:04:49.452
OF THE ACT, AND A PERSON MAY

01:04:49.518 --> 01:04:51.821
INITIALLY CONSENT AND THEY CAN

01:04:51.887 --> 01:04:56.325
WITHDRAW THEIR CONSENT. IF A

01:04:56.392 --> 01:04:59.762
SUSPECT OF A SEXUAL ASSAULT,

01:04:59.829 --> 01:05:02.031
REASONABLY AND OBJECTIVELY

01:05:02.098 --> 01:05:04.467
BELIEVES THAT THIS PERSON IS

01:05:04.533 --> 01:05:08.904
CONSENTING, THERE IS NO CRIME.

01:05:08.971 --> 01:05:13.509
SO THE LAW HAS BUILT IN ACROSS

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:16.646
MANY PENAL CODES THE DEFINITION

01:05:16.712 --> 01:05:18.581
OF CONSENT AND THE APPLICATION

01:05:18.648 --> 01:05:20.316
OF CONSENT, AND BUILT IN

01:05:20.383 --> 01:05:22.952
PROTECTIONS FOR THOSE WHO ARE

01:05:23.019 --> 01:05:25.421
ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. AND

01:05:25.488 --> 01:05:27.857
THE LAW LOOKS AT WHAT WERE THE

01:05:27.923 --> 01:05:29.825
NATURE AND CIRCUMSTANCES, WHAT

01:05:29.892 --> 01:05:32.662
WAS GOING ON THAT DAY, WHAT DID

01:05:32.728 --> 01:05:35.131
THAT INCIDENT ENTAIL? WHAT

01:05:35.197 --> 01:05:36.132
HAPPENED TO THAT VICTIM? WHAT

01:05:36.198 --> 01:05:38.434
WAS SAID? WHAT DID SHE DO? WHAT

01:05:38.501 --> 01:05:40.136
DID HE DO? I'M ASSUMING THESE

01:05:40.202 --> 01:05:44.907
ARE NOT SAME SEX COUPLES. FOR

01:05:44.974 --> 01:05:46.976
PURPOSES OF THIS HYPOTHETICAL.

01:05:47.043 --> 01:05:52.048
AND THE LAW WILL ALSO LOOK AT IF

01:05:52.114 --> 01:05:53.449
SOMEONE HAS A DISABILITY. HOW

01:05:53.516 --> 01:05:56.385
DID THAT DISABILITY AFFECT THAT

01:05:56.452 --> 01:05:58.921
PERSON IN THAT MOMENT? THERE ARE

01:05:58.988 --> 01:06:02.825
NO LABELS THAT ARE PERMANENT,

01:06:02.892 --> 01:06:05.394
AND THE OPPOSITION HAS EXPRESSED

01:06:05.461 --> 01:06:07.863
NUMEROUS TIMES TO US A CONCERN

01:06:07.930 --> 01:06:10.833
THAT A THIRD PARTY OR A FAMILY

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:14.103
MEMBER OF THE ID INDIVIDUAL WILL

01:06:14.170 --> 01:06:16.539
HAVE STRONG FEELINGS LIKE THIS

01:06:16.605 --> 01:06:18.341
PERSON SHOULD NOT BE ENGAGING IN

01:06:18.407 --> 01:06:20.142
IN SEX, THIS IS WRONG AND

01:06:20.209 --> 01:06:21.777
THEREFORE THAT PERSON HAS TAKEN

01:06:21.844 --> 01:06:24.180
ADVANTAGE OF THEM AND THEY MUST

01:06:24.246 --> 01:06:27.149
BE PUNISHED. AND THERE THEY

01:06:27.216 --> 01:06:28.751
VOICED A CONCERN THAT THAT

01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:30.353
SCENARIO IS GOING TO LEAD TO A

01:06:30.419 --> 01:06:31.587
PROSECUTION. BUT THAT'S NOT HOW

01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:34.757
IT WORKS. WE DON'T HAVE SOMEONE

01:06:34.824 --> 01:06:36.325
COME OFF THE STREET AND SAY,

01:06:36.392 --> 01:06:37.660
HEY, I WANT THE PERSON WHO'S

01:06:37.727 --> 01:06:39.495
DATING MY DAUGHTER TO BE CHARGED

01:06:39.562 --> 01:06:42.231
WITH RAPE BECAUSE SHE'S ID, AND

01:06:42.298 --> 01:06:43.966
THEN THAT PERSON IS CHARGED WITH

01:06:44.033 --> 01:06:45.501
RAPE. THAT'S JUST NOT HOW IT

01:06:45.568 --> 01:06:47.737
WORKS. WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT

01:06:47.803 --> 01:06:49.772
HAPPENED IN THAT INCIDENT. WHAT

01:06:49.839 --> 01:06:52.742
IS THAT PERSON WITH THE ID?

01:06:52.808 --> 01:06:56.712
ALLEGED? ID SAY WHAT WAS THEIR

01:06:56.779 --> 01:06:58.114
EXPERIENCE? WHAT DO THEY WANT TO

01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:03.586
HAVE HAPPEN? SO THE BELIEF THAT

01:07:03.652 --> 01:07:07.256
THIS LAW WILL HARM PEOPLE IS

01:07:07.323 --> 01:07:10.493
REALLY ABSURD. MORE PEOPLE WILL

01:07:10.559 --> 01:07:13.162
BE HARMED BY NOT GETTING RID OF

01:07:13.229 --> 01:07:17.266
THIS LOOPHOLE. THIS LOOPHOLE

01:07:17.333 --> 01:07:20.069
LEGALIZES RAPE. AND UNDER NO

01:07:20.136 --> 01:07:23.739
SCENARIO IS THAT OKAY? NO, I

01:07:23.806 --> 01:07:24.840
DON'T THINK ANYBODY HERE IS

01:07:24.907 --> 01:07:27.676
TRYING TO DEFEND THE RAPIST. I

01:07:27.743 --> 01:07:29.278
THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS

01:07:29.345 --> 01:07:32.648
DEFINE THE WILLING, CONSENTING

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:34.483
AND HAVING THAT BEING

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:36.352
MISINTERPRETED AS BECAUSE THEY

01:07:36.419 --> 01:07:38.154
HAVE A DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY,

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:39.288
THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE

01:07:39.355 --> 01:07:40.990
CAPACITY TO CONSENT. I THINK

01:07:41.056 --> 01:07:42.525
THAT'S CLEARLY A CONCERN BECAUSE

01:07:42.591 --> 01:07:44.427
WE HAD I KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT A

01:07:44.493 --> 01:07:47.963
NEW CONCERN. ON MAY 23RD, WHEN

01:07:48.030 --> 01:07:48.831
YOU HAD THE SENATE PUBLIC SAFETY

01:07:48.898 --> 01:07:51.000
HEARING. I KNOW SENATOR WIENER

01:07:51.066 --> 01:07:53.536
ASKED IF YOU WOULD WORK WITH OUR

01:07:53.602 --> 01:07:56.005
OPPONENTS HERE IN THE DISABILITY

01:07:56.071 --> 01:07:57.706
COMMUNITY. AND I'VE BEEN TOLD

01:07:57.773 --> 01:07:59.108
SINCE THAT TIME YOU'VE HAD ONE

01:07:59.175 --> 01:08:01.911
MEETING AND THEY PROPOSED

01:08:01.977 --> 01:08:03.412
AMENDMENTS, ESPECIALLY THE ONE

01:08:03.479 --> 01:08:04.680
LISTED IN THE SMART JUSTICE

01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:07.383
OPPOSITION LETTER. AND IS THERE

01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:09.985
A SPECIFIC REASON YOU COULD HELP

01:08:10.052 --> 01:08:10.619
US UNDERSTAND WHY YOU REJECTED

01:08:10.686 --> 01:08:12.755
THAT AMENDMENT? YES. SO IT'S NOT

01:08:12.822 --> 01:08:15.124
EXACTLY ACCURATE. WE HAVE BEEN

01:08:15.191 --> 01:08:17.827
HAVING CONVERSATIONS LONG TERM,

01:08:17.893 --> 01:08:19.562
AND WE HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS

01:08:19.628 --> 01:08:24.166
EVEN BEFORE THE SENATE HEARING.

01:08:24.233 --> 01:08:26.235
FIRST AND FOREMOST, YOU KNOW, WE

01:08:26.302 --> 01:08:27.803
HAD WE ASKED FOR AMENDMENTS

01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:30.372
EARLY ON IN THE SENATE AND WE

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:32.575
WERE MET WITH, WE DON'T WANT TO

01:08:32.641 --> 01:08:33.776
GIVE AMENDMENTS. WE'RE GOING TO

01:08:33.843 --> 01:08:36.412
BE IN OPPOSITION. THEN IT CAME

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:37.646
BACK THAT IT WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY

01:08:37.713 --> 01:08:39.782
AND ASKED FOR THINGS THAT WERE

01:08:39.849 --> 01:08:40.883
PATENTLY UNREASONABLE, INCLUDING

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:43.252
SEX ED THAT WAS ASKED, THIS IS

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:45.421
NOT A SEX ED BILL. THIS IS

01:08:45.488 --> 01:08:47.623
PURELY REMOVE SPOUSAL RAPE

01:08:47.690 --> 01:08:50.092
EXCEPTIONS. RIGHT? WE PROVIDED A

01:08:50.159 --> 01:08:51.427
COUNTER PROPOSAL THAT ADDRESSED

01:08:51.494 --> 01:08:53.062
ALL OF THE CONCERNS THEY HAD

01:08:53.128 --> 01:08:54.463
PREVIOUSLY RAISED, EXPLAINING

01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:55.564
WHY WE COULDN'T ACCEPT

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:56.632
AMENDMENTS THEY OFFERED. THEY

01:08:56.699 --> 01:08:58.701
WERE TOO BROAD AND ENORMOUS

01:08:58.767 --> 01:08:59.969
POTENTIAL TO CAUSE EVEN MORE

01:09:00.035 --> 01:09:02.037
WIDE RANGING UNINTENDED

01:09:02.104 --> 01:09:04.173
CONSEQUENCES. MIND YOU, WE HAVE

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:05.608
MULTIPLE LAWYERS THAT SUPPORT

01:09:05.674 --> 01:09:07.610
THIS BILL, INCLUDING STANFORD

01:09:07.676 --> 01:09:10.980
LAW PROFESSORS AND MUCH MORE. IN

01:09:11.046 --> 01:09:14.216
RESPONSE TO OUR OFFER, DRC

01:09:14.283 --> 01:09:16.018
SPECIFICALLY TOLD US, AND THERE

01:09:16.085 --> 01:09:19.188
IS CLEAR, YOU KNOW, TRACK RECORD

01:09:19.255 --> 01:09:22.157
HERE, THAT THEY WERE NO LONGER

01:09:22.224 --> 01:09:23.559
INTERESTED IN ENGAGING IN

01:09:23.626 --> 01:09:24.660
AMENDMENTS WHEN WE SAID THAT WE

01:09:24.727 --> 01:09:26.829
WILL NOT PUT A SEX ED BILL INTO

01:09:26.896 --> 01:09:28.330
THIS PARTICULAR PIECE, AND THAT

01:09:28.397 --> 01:09:30.432
WAS ONE OF THE MANY ITEMS THAT

01:09:30.499 --> 01:09:34.270
THEY ASKED FOR. WE WERE ALSO

01:09:34.336 --> 01:09:36.572
TOLD THAT, YOU KNOW, IN THE

01:09:36.639 --> 01:09:37.506
COUNTER PROPOSALS, THE BACK AND

01:09:37.573 --> 01:09:40.543
FORTH, THAT TO CREATE A CAPACITY

01:09:40.609 --> 01:09:41.944
DEFINITION, WHICH WE EXPLAINED

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:44.146
WHY WE CANNOT CREATE A CAPACITY

01:09:44.213 --> 01:09:46.649
DEFINITION, OUR LEGAL EXPERTS

01:09:46.715 --> 01:09:47.850
EXHAUSTIVELY SEARCHED OTHER

01:09:47.917 --> 01:09:49.485
STATES PENAL CODES ASKING FOR

01:09:49.552 --> 01:09:51.287
ANYTHING SIMILAR AND WERE UNABLE

01:09:51.353 --> 01:09:53.522
TO COME UP WITH ANYTHING IN ALL

01:09:53.589 --> 01:09:56.759
50 STATES. WE ASKED FOR SMART

01:09:56.825 --> 01:09:58.594
JUSTICE TO PROVIDE EXAMPLES OF

01:09:58.661 --> 01:09:59.929
OTHER STATES WITH SIMILAR

01:09:59.995 --> 01:10:01.096
LANGUAGE, AND THERE WAS NO

01:10:01.163 --> 01:10:03.566
RESPONSE TO THAT AS WELL. SO

01:10:03.632 --> 01:10:05.701
WHEN WE WERE MET WITH WE ARE NO

01:10:05.768 --> 01:10:07.303
LONGER INTERESTED IN ENGAGING,

01:10:07.369 --> 01:10:08.571
YOU KNOW, WE CONTINUED MOVING

01:10:08.637 --> 01:10:10.673
THE BILL FORWARD. MR. LACKEY,

01:10:10.739 --> 01:10:12.641
I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOUR LINE

01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:13.309
OF QUESTIONING. I WILL NOTE THAT

01:10:13.375 --> 01:10:14.610
OUR SECOND OPPOSITION WITNESS

01:10:14.677 --> 01:10:16.545
DID ARRIVE ON YOUR BEST

01:10:16.612 --> 01:10:18.113
AVAILABLE TIME AT THE CHAIR'S

01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:19.882
DISCRETION. I'M GOING TO GO OUT

01:10:19.949 --> 01:10:20.749
OF ORDER. ALLOW HER TO PRESENT

01:10:20.816 --> 01:10:22.017
HER TESTIMONY FOR 2.5 MINUTES.

01:10:22.084 --> 01:10:23.919
I'LL THEN TURN IT BACK TO YOU,

01:10:23.986 --> 01:10:25.721
MR. LACKEY. THAT'S FINE. HI.

01:10:25.788 --> 01:10:28.424
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR

01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:30.659
GRACE. MY NAME IS CAROLYN

01:10:30.726 --> 01:10:32.728
GEHRIG, AND I AM THE DISABLED

01:10:32.795 --> 01:10:34.797
SURVIVOR OF SPOUSAL RAPE WHO MET

01:10:34.863 --> 01:10:36.398
WITH MANY OF YOUR STAFF THIS

01:10:36.465 --> 01:10:38.167
SPRING WHILE WORKING WITH

01:10:38.233 --> 01:10:40.302
SENATOR DOCTOR WAHHAB'S OFFICE

01:10:40.369 --> 01:10:43.238
AND THE NCPC TO TELL PART OF MY

01:10:43.305 --> 01:10:45.874
STORY AND ASK YOU TO SIGN ON IN

01:10:45.941 --> 01:10:51.814
SUPPORT OF SB 258. IT IS

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:54.016
OBVIOUSLY VERY STRANGE, OR

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:54.950
SHOULD BE VERY STRANGE THAT I'M

01:10:55.017 --> 01:10:56.719
HERE NOW ASKING YOU TO OPPOSE

01:10:56.785 --> 01:11:01.590
IT. SO I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN WHY.

01:11:01.657 --> 01:11:04.893
IN FEBRUARY OF 2018, I WROTE AN

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:06.128
ESSAY CALLED TIME'S UP FOR ME

01:11:06.195 --> 01:11:08.697
TOO. IT IS WIDELY AVAILABLE AND

01:11:08.764 --> 01:11:11.000
AS OF THIS MORNING IT WAS EVEN

01:11:11.066 --> 01:11:14.103
POSTED ON SB 258. ORG'S WEBSITE.

01:11:14.169 --> 01:11:15.137
IT'S TAUGHT IN DISABILITY

01:11:15.204 --> 01:11:19.475
STUDIES CLASSES WORLDWIDE, AND

01:11:19.541 --> 01:11:21.243
IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR, I WAS

01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:23.278
CONTACTED BY THE SENATOR'S

01:11:23.345 --> 01:11:24.613
OFFICE AND A REPRESENTATIVE OF

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:26.715
THE NCPC BECAUSE THEY HAD READ

01:11:26.782 --> 01:11:28.283
THAT ESSAY AND WANTED ME TO

01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:30.686
TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THE BILL. I

01:11:30.753 --> 01:11:31.253
SAID YES IMMEDIATELY. YES,

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.655
BECAUSE WHO WANTS A LOOPHOLE IN

01:11:32.721 --> 01:11:34.289
A RAPE LAW, ESPECIALLY ONE THAT

01:11:34.356 --> 01:11:35.624
IMPACTS THE OTHER DISABLED

01:11:35.691 --> 01:11:38.260
PEOPLE? THAT ESSAY EXPLORED

01:11:38.327 --> 01:11:39.261
DISABILITY, SPOUSAL RAPE,

01:11:39.328 --> 01:11:40.796
LATERAL ABLEISM AND OUR

01:11:40.863 --> 01:11:43.198
EXCLUSION FROM REPRESENTATION.

01:11:43.265 --> 01:11:45.100
IN THAT BILL. I MENTIONED, IT

01:11:45.167 --> 01:11:46.435
WAS FOCUSED ON MEDIA

01:11:46.502 --> 01:11:48.303
REPRESENTATION, BUT REALLY IT'S

01:11:48.370 --> 01:11:51.273
ABOUT REPRESENTATION EVERYWHERE.

01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:53.742
MORE SPECIFICALLY, I WROTE ABOUT

01:11:53.809 --> 01:11:54.476
MY EX-HUSBAND, WHO REPEATEDLY

01:11:54.543 --> 01:11:55.911
TOOK ADVANTAGE OF MY

01:11:55.978 --> 01:11:57.279
DISABILITIES TO RAPE ME OVER THE

01:11:57.346 --> 01:11:58.981
COURSE OF OUR MARRIAGE,

01:11:59.048 --> 01:12:00.482
DOCUMENTED IT EXTENSIVELY, AND

01:12:00.549 --> 01:12:02.151
CONFESSED IT TO THE LAPD BEFORE

01:12:02.217 --> 01:12:04.119
THE DA TOLD ME HE WOULD NOT BE

01:12:04.186 --> 01:12:05.921
PROSECUTED. IT'S BEEN 14 YEARS

01:12:05.988 --> 01:12:07.322
SINCE THAT HAPPENED, AND I STILL

01:12:07.389 --> 01:12:09.058
HAVE THE CHARGE SHEET. EVERY

01:12:09.124 --> 01:12:13.028
TIME THE ESSAY IS PUBLISHED OR

01:12:13.095 --> 01:12:14.897
REPRINTED, I RECEIVE DMS FROM

01:12:14.963 --> 01:12:16.498
PEOPLE DISCLOSING THEIR OWN

01:12:16.565 --> 01:12:17.866
ASSAULTS. I ALSO RECEIVED

01:12:17.933 --> 01:12:19.234
THREATS, STALKING AND

01:12:19.301 --> 01:12:21.236
HARASSMENT. IT IS NOT. I PUT

01:12:21.303 --> 01:12:23.605
MYSELF AT RISK TO BE HERE JUST

01:12:23.672 --> 01:12:25.441
TO BE OPEN ABOUT THAT. EARLIER

01:12:25.507 --> 01:12:27.276
THIS SPRING, AS I SPOKE WITH

01:12:27.342 --> 01:12:28.377
STAFF FROM NEARLY ALL OF THE

01:12:28.444 --> 01:12:29.678
MEMBERS OF THE SENATE PUBLIC

01:12:29.745 --> 01:12:31.146
SAFETY COMMITTEE OVER ZOOM,

01:12:31.213 --> 01:12:32.614
IDENTIFYING MYSELF AS A DISABLED

01:12:32.681 --> 01:12:35.284
ADVOCATE AND SURVIVOR. 30S.

01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:39.888
OKAY. SORRY. I'LL GO. I'LL JUST

01:12:39.955 --> 01:12:42.658
SKIP AHEAD. LATE THIS SPRING, I

01:12:42.725 --> 01:12:43.592
LEARNED THAT THE BILL WOULD NOT

01:12:43.659 --> 01:12:45.661
FIX THE LOOPHOLE CREATED BY ITS

01:12:45.728 --> 01:12:46.562
PARENT BILL WITHOUT REMOVING THE

01:12:46.628 --> 01:12:48.497
CIVIL LIBERTIES OF PART OF THE

01:12:48.564 --> 01:12:49.298
DISABILITY COMMUNITY. THIS IS

01:12:49.364 --> 01:12:51.467
NOT A BILL THAT CAN BE WHOLLY

01:12:51.533 --> 01:12:53.135
FIXED BY AMENDMENTS, BECAUSE THE

01:12:53.202 --> 01:12:53.736
LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWS FOR THE

01:12:53.802 --> 01:12:55.237
DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES IS

01:12:55.304 --> 01:12:56.338
HOUSED IN ANOTHER PART OF THE

01:12:56.405 --> 01:12:57.773
STATE LAW TO CREATE ANOTHER BILL

01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:58.907
TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES CREATED BY

01:12:58.974 --> 01:13:00.943
THIS ONE WOULD BE AN UNNECESSARY

01:13:01.009 --> 01:13:02.478
HERCULEAN TASK. AT THIS TIME, I

01:13:02.544 --> 01:13:03.512
WAS ALSO TOLD I WOULD NOT BE

01:13:03.579 --> 01:13:05.314
NEEDED TO TESTIFY BACK TO THE

01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:07.015
ESSAY. IN THAT ESSAY, I ALSO

01:13:07.082 --> 01:13:08.050
WROTE ABOUT MY INTELLECTUALLY

01:13:08.117 --> 01:13:09.651
AND DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED

01:13:09.718 --> 01:13:10.919
AUNT, WHO EXPERIENCED MULTIPLE

01:13:10.986 --> 01:13:13.255
SEXUAL ASSAULTS AT HER SHELTERED

01:13:13.322 --> 01:13:15.157
WORKSHOP AND DAY CENTERS. I

01:13:15.224 --> 01:13:17.025
WROTE ABOUT HER ENTHUSIASTIC

01:13:17.092 --> 01:13:18.026
EXPRESSION OF ROMANTIC DESIRE

01:13:18.093 --> 01:13:19.595
AND HOW HARD IT WAS TO

01:13:19.661 --> 01:13:21.096
UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING. I'M SORRY

01:13:21.163 --> 01:13:23.031
THAT WE'RE AT TIME. I'LL GIVE

01:13:23.098 --> 01:13:24.600
YOU A SENTENCE TO WRAP UP, BUT

01:13:24.666 --> 01:13:26.635
WE'RE AT TIME, OKAY? I SHOULDN'T

01:13:26.702 --> 01:13:27.703
HAVE TO POINT OUT THAT IT'S

01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:29.905
WRONG TO GIVE NOMINAL JUSTICE TO

01:13:29.972 --> 01:13:30.906
SOME OF THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY

01:13:30.973 --> 01:13:32.307
AT THE EXPENSE OF DISABLED

01:13:32.374 --> 01:13:33.642
PEOPLE WHOSE FREEDOMS SEEM LESS

01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:36.645
VALUABLE. THIS BILL IS SUPPORTED

01:13:36.712 --> 01:13:39.248
BY DISABLED PEOPLE, IS OPPOSED

01:13:39.314 --> 01:13:40.449
BY DISABLED PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN

01:13:40.516 --> 01:13:42.484
ACTIVE IN THE COMMUNITY FOR A

01:13:42.551 --> 01:13:43.819
LONG TIME, AND THIS BILL WOULD

01:13:43.886 --> 01:13:46.221
NOT LIKELY HAVE CHANGED THE

01:13:46.288 --> 01:13:47.322
OUTCOME OF MY CASE IF IT

01:13:47.389 --> 01:13:49.324
OCCURRED TODAY. I'M GOING TO I'M

01:13:49.391 --> 01:13:50.726
GOING TO STOP YOU RIGHT THERE.

01:13:50.793 --> 01:13:52.461
WE KNOW IT'S OKAY. WE MAY HAVE

01:13:52.528 --> 01:13:53.862
MORE QUESTIONS FOR YOU. I JUST

01:13:53.929 --> 01:13:55.497
ON A PERSONAL NOTE, WANT TO

01:13:55.564 --> 01:13:57.366
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY.

01:13:57.432 --> 01:13:58.400
THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO

01:13:58.467 --> 01:14:00.602
COME UP HERE. I CANNOT IMAGINE

01:14:00.669 --> 01:14:01.370
THAT TELLING YOUR STORY GETS ANY

01:14:01.436 --> 01:14:03.338
EASIER WITH TIME. AND I WANT YOU

01:14:03.405 --> 01:14:05.174
TO KNOW THAT WE APPRECIATE ALL

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:06.675
OF US. APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE

01:14:06.742 --> 01:14:08.377
TO BE PART OF THIS IMPORTANT

01:14:08.443 --> 01:14:09.378
CONVERSATION. SO THANK YOU. WE

01:14:09.444 --> 01:14:10.612
MAY HAVE MORE QUESTIONS, BUT

01:14:10.679 --> 01:14:12.414
WITH THAT, MR. LACKEY, I WANT TO

01:14:12.481 --> 01:14:14.183
TURN IT BACK TO YOU. WELL THANK

01:14:14.249 --> 01:14:16.518
YOU. I THINK THAT THAT WITNESSES

01:14:16.585 --> 01:14:17.152
WITNESS SHOWS HOW COMPLEX THIS

01:14:17.219 --> 01:14:20.622
ISSUE IS. AND WE NEED TO REALLY

01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:22.791
FOCUS ON THIS CONCERN ABOUT THE

01:14:22.858 --> 01:14:26.328
CAPACITY TO CONSENT, BECAUSE I

01:14:26.395 --> 01:14:27.462
DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYBODY UP

01:14:27.529 --> 01:14:30.132
HERE THAT SUPPORTS RAPE. RAPE IS

01:14:30.199 --> 01:14:33.268
CLEARLY AN UNACCEPTABLE PATHWAY.

01:14:33.335 --> 01:14:35.971
BUT WHAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IS

01:14:36.038 --> 01:14:38.340
THAT IT'S NOT CHARGED WHEN IT

01:14:38.407 --> 01:14:41.009
SHOULDN'T BE. AND WHEN THERE IS

01:14:41.076 --> 01:14:43.345
CONSENT, IT NEEDS TO BE SEEN AS

01:14:43.412 --> 01:14:44.713
SUCH. BUT WHEN IT'S NOT, IT

01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:49.785
NEEDS TO BE SEEN AS NOT. AND

01:14:49.852 --> 01:14:50.619
ALTHOUGH THAT SOUNDS VERY SIMPLE

01:14:50.686 --> 01:14:53.755
WHEN YOU HAVE. A CHALLENGE IN

01:14:53.822 --> 01:14:56.592
HOW TO COMMUNICATE, THAT BECOMES

01:14:56.658 --> 01:15:00.596
VERY, VERY COMPLEX. AND SO I,

01:15:00.662 --> 01:15:01.830
I'M CLEARLY GOING TO SUPPORT

01:15:01.897 --> 01:15:03.565
THIS TODAY BECAUSE I NEED TO

01:15:03.632 --> 01:15:05.701
SEND THE MESSAGE THAT RAPE IS

01:15:05.767 --> 01:15:08.103
NEVER ACCEPTABLE, EVER. BUT I

01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:09.905
WISH AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL

01:15:09.972 --> 01:15:12.541
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE

01:15:12.608 --> 01:15:13.575
OPPOSITION TO HELP THEM

01:15:13.642 --> 01:15:15.043
UNDERSTAND IT. THAT'S WHAT YOUR

01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:16.511
INTENTION AND WHAT THE OUTCOME

01:15:16.578 --> 01:15:19.548
WILL BE OF YOUR PROPOSAL. AND

01:15:19.615 --> 01:15:21.884
WITH THAT, I'M DONE. THANK YOU

01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:23.252
VERY MUCH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:15:23.318 --> 01:15:24.486
LACKEY, WOULD ANYONE ELSE LIKE

01:15:24.553 --> 01:15:26.321
TO GO FORWARD WITH A QUESTION OR

01:15:26.388 --> 01:15:28.257
COMMENT FROM THE DAIS? MR. VICE

01:15:28.323 --> 01:15:29.925
CHAIR, MAKE THIS REAL QUICK. MR.

01:15:29.992 --> 01:15:33.295
CHAIR. THANK YOU. AS PROBABLY

01:15:33.362 --> 01:15:34.496
FEW MEMBERS WHO CAN ACTUALLY SAY

01:15:34.563 --> 01:15:35.797
THEY'VE WORKED ON RAPE CASES

01:15:35.864 --> 01:15:37.366
HERE IN THIS BUILDING, IT IS

01:15:37.432 --> 01:15:38.600
HARD TO PROVE AND AN

01:15:38.667 --> 01:15:40.602
INVESTIGATION DOES NEED TO BE

01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:41.803
DONE. AND IT'S IN THE HANDS OF

01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:42.738
THE INVESTIGATORS, DISTRICT

01:15:42.804 --> 01:15:44.506
ATTORNEYS ALSO TO PROVE ALL THAT

01:15:44.573 --> 01:15:45.707
AND THE BURDENS AND EVERYTHING

01:15:45.774 --> 01:15:47.442
ELSE THAT GO ALONG WITH IT. SO I

01:15:47.509 --> 01:15:48.777
WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING

01:15:48.844 --> 01:15:50.612
THIS ALONG AS WELL. AND I WILL

01:15:50.679 --> 01:15:52.547
BE MOVING THE BILL. WE HAVE A

01:15:52.614 --> 01:15:53.749
MOTION. IS THERE A SECOND? OKAY.

01:15:53.815 --> 01:15:56.351

ELSE? ARE WE ALLOWED? NO, ONLY

01:16:06.261 --> 01:16:07.396
IF A QUESTION IS POSED. I'M

01:16:07.462 --> 01:16:09.364
SORRY. IF WITH NO OTHER

01:16:09.431 --> 01:16:10.799
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE

01:16:10.866 --> 01:16:13.568

AS FORMER CHAIR OF PUBLIC

01:16:31.019 --> 01:16:32.688
SAFETY, SEXUAL ASSAULT CRIMES

01:16:32.754 --> 01:16:33.889
ARE ONE OF THE WORST. THAT

01:16:33.956 --> 01:16:36.024
LEAVES A MARK FOR A LIFETIME ON

01:16:36.091 --> 01:16:39.294
AN INDIVIDUAL AND WHAT WE ARE

01:16:39.361 --> 01:16:41.396

YOU, MISTER CHAIR. AND MEMBERS,

01:18:38.647 --> 01:18:40.649
I'M GOING TO TRY TO MODEL

01:18:40.715 --> 01:18:41.283
BEHAVIOR BECAUSE SENATE

BILL. SB 398 CLOSE A LOOPHOLE,

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:53.795
MAKING IT A CRIME FOR A PERSON

01:18:53.862 --> 01:18:54.796

01:18:54.863 --> 01:18:57.532
OFFER TO PAY OTHER VALUABLE

MORNING, CHAIR AND MEMBERS.

01:19:09.444 --> 01:19:10.712
PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:19:10.779 --> 01:19:11.379
CLEAN MONEY CAMPAIGN. WE'RE

SENATOR UMBERG AND THE

01:19:16.518 --> 01:19:16.918
COMMITTEE. ONE OF THE

01:19:16.985 --> 01:19:18.320
CORNERSTONES OF OUR DEMOCRACY IS

01:19:18.386 --> 01:19:19.588
THE PRINCIPLE THAT NO ONE SHOULD

01:19:19.654 --> 01:19:21.323
BE ALLOWED TO BUY VOTES. THERE

01:19:21.389 --> 01:19:24.025
CURRENTLY IS A LOOPHOLE TO OFFER

01:19:24.092 --> 01:19:25.694
CASH AND LOTTERIES, AS LONG AS

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:27.696
PEOPLE DO NOT EXPLICITLY ASK TO

01:19:27.762 --> 01:19:29.464
VOTE. THIS BILL CLOSES THOSE

01:19:29.531 --> 01:19:30.465
LOOPHOLES, SO WE RESPECTFULLY

01:19:30.532 --> 01:19:32.434
REQUEST YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU.

01:19:32.501 --> 01:19:33.602
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU BOTH. I

01:19:33.668 --> 01:19:34.669
THINK THAT'S RECORD TIME,

01:19:34.736 --> 01:19:38.206
SENATOR. NICELY DONE. ME TOO IS

01:19:38.273 --> 01:19:40.142
NEXT. IF YOU'RE IN SUPPORT OF

01:19:40.208 --> 01:19:41.276
THE BILL, COME FORWARD AT THIS

01:19:41.343 --> 01:19:42.677
TIME. SEEING NO ONE. ANYONE HERE

01:19:42.744 --> 01:19:44.846
TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THE

01:19:44.913 --> 01:19:47.616
BILL. ANY SHOW OF HANDS? NO. ANY

01:19:47.682 --> 01:19:50.252
OTHER ME TOOS? WE HAVE ONE.

01:19:50.318 --> 01:19:59.327
OKAY. YES. COME ON DOWN. I'LL BE

01:19:59.394 --> 01:20:01.496
QUICK. MY NAME IS DAVE APOLOGUE.

01:20:01.563 --> 01:20:03.999
I NOTICED THAT THE LEGISLATION.

01:20:04.065 --> 01:20:05.534
LEGISLATORS HAVE TRIED IN VAIN

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:07.269
TO TRY TO GET PEOPLE TO COME OUT

01:20:07.335 --> 01:20:09.804
AND VOTE. MORE AND MORE, I

01:20:09.871 --> 01:20:12.374
QUESTION, THOUGH, IF THIS WAS

01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:14.776
DONE BY ANOTHER PERSON WHO

01:20:14.843 --> 01:20:15.977
SUPPORTS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY,

01:20:16.044 --> 01:20:20.282
SUCH AS SOROS, A ONE OF THE

01:20:20.348 --> 01:20:22.017
TRIBES, OR THE PRITZKERS. IF THE

01:20:22.083 --> 01:20:23.685
SENATOR WOULD HAVE HAD A PROBLEM

01:20:23.752 --> 01:20:25.453
WITH THIS, OR IF IT WAS DONE IN

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:27.455
SUPPORT OF HIS FORMER SEATMATE

01:20:27.522 --> 01:20:28.590
WHO HAS JUST BEEN ON HIS HIS

01:20:28.657 --> 01:20:31.860
PODCAST RECENTLY. SO THAT'S MY

01:20:31.927 --> 01:20:32.827
QUESTION. WOULD THIS ACTUALLY

01:20:32.894 --> 01:20:33.828
HAVE HAPPENED IF IT WAS SOMEBODY

01:20:33.895 --> 01:20:35.630
FROM THE OTHER PARTY TO TRY TO

01:20:35.697 --> 01:20:37.332
GET PEOPLE TO COME OUT AND VOTE?

01:20:37.399 --> 01:20:38.800
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, I JUST

01:20:38.867 --> 01:20:40.802
WANT TO SAY TO SENATOR UMBERG,

01:20:40.869 --> 01:20:42.003
IT'S IMPORTANT TO LISTEN TO YOUR

01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.671
CONSTITUENTS. YOU'VE HAD PEOPLE

01:20:42.737 --> 01:20:44.606

01:20:44.673 --> 01:20:45.540

TREAT THAT AS OPPOSITION

01:20:53.949 --> 01:20:55.450
TESTIMONY. ANYONE ELSE HOPING TO

01:20:55.517 --> 01:20:56.585
BE HEARD ON THE BILL? OKAY,

01:20:56.651 --> 01:20:58.954
WE'LL TURN IT BACK TO THE DAIS.

01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:00.689
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS? A SECOND

01:21:00.755 --> 01:21:01.556
MOTION BY NGUYEN. I THINK I

01:21:01.623 --> 01:21:02.691
HEARD THE SECOND FROM DOCTOR

01:21:02.757 --> 01:21:04.726
SHARPE. COLLINS. SENATOR UMBERG

WILL GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO CLOSE.

01:21:07.295 --> 01:21:08.163
THANK YOU. THE OPPOSITION IS.

01:21:08.230 --> 01:21:11.399
YES. I HAD NO DOUBT. AND WITH

01:21:11.466 --> 01:21:12.901
THAT, SENATOR UMBERG, I AM

01:21:12.968 --> 01:21:13.468
RECOMMENDING AN AYE WITH A

01:21:13.535 --> 01:21:15.036
MOTION. AND SECOND, LET'S CALL

01:21:15.103 --> 01:21:17.072
THE ROLL ON SENATE BILL 398 BY

01:21:17.138 --> 01:21:18.506
SENATOR UMBERG. THE MOTION IS

01:21:18.573 --> 01:21:20.242
DUE PASSED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS

01:21:20.308 --> 01:21:21.509
COMMITTEE. SCHULTZ. SCHULTZ.

01:21:21.576 --> 01:21:23.979
AYE. ALANIZ. ALANIZ. AYE.

01:21:24.045 --> 01:21:26.781
GONZALEZ. HANEY. HARVARDIAN.

01:21:26.848 --> 01:21:29.384
LACKEY. LACKEY I NGUYEN NGUYEN

01:21:29.451 --> 01:21:31.853

OKAY. THAT BILLS OUT REMAINS ON

01:21:36.625 --> 01:21:38.126
CALL. THANK YOU. SENATOR. WOULD

01:21:38.193 --> 01:21:40.929
YOU LIKE TO GO TO ITEM 1 OR 2

01:21:40.996 --> 01:21:44.132
NEXT SB 27 I'M NOT SURE THAT IS

01:21:44.199 --> 01:21:46.034
THAT IS ITEM NUMBER ONE TO MY

01:21:46.101 --> 01:21:47.669
COLLEAGUES. SENATE BILL 27 BY

01:21:47.736 --> 01:21:49.004
SENATOR UMBERG. WHEN YOU'RE

01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:50.305
READY, SENATOR, FIVE MINUTES FOR

01:21:50.372 --> 01:21:51.506
YOU AND FOR YOUR WITNESSES.

01:21:51.573 --> 01:21:54.209
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. CHAIR.

01:21:54.276 --> 01:21:55.310
AND THANK YOU TO MISS CHOI FOR

01:21:55.377 --> 01:21:58.813
YOUR HELP ON THIS MEASURE. CARE

01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:00.649
COURT WAS ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED

01:22:00.715 --> 01:22:04.319
SEVERAL YEARS AGO AT THE

01:22:04.386 --> 01:22:05.754
BASICALLY AT THE INSTIGATION OF

01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:07.656
THE GOVERNOR. SENATOR EGGMAN AND

01:22:07.722 --> 01:22:10.025
I CARRIED A BILL THAT

01:22:10.091 --> 01:22:12.594
ESTABLISHED THE CARE PROGRAM AND

01:22:12.661 --> 01:22:15.797
CARE COURT. WHAT CARE COURT DOES

01:22:15.864 --> 01:22:18.300
IS IT FOCUSES ON THOSE WHO ARE

01:22:18.366 --> 01:22:19.401
SCHIZOPHRENIC OR HAVE

01:22:19.467 --> 01:22:22.203
SCHIZOPHRENIA LIKE CONDITIONS.

01:22:22.270 --> 01:22:25.173
WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT CLEANS

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:27.275
UP SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE

01:22:27.342 --> 01:22:29.044
TRYING TO ADDRESS IN TERMS OF

01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:31.279
MAKING CARE COURT MORE EFFICIENT

01:22:31.346 --> 01:22:33.214
AND ADDRESSING THE POPULATION IT

01:22:33.281 --> 01:22:34.816
WAS INTENDED TO ADDRESS. AND

01:22:34.883 --> 01:22:37.385
THOSE ARE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA.

01:22:37.452 --> 01:22:39.688
SCHIZOPHRENIA LIKE CONDITIONS.

01:22:39.754 --> 01:22:40.522
THIS BILL HAS BEEN TRIPLED

01:22:40.588 --> 01:22:41.956
REFERRED. IT'S BEEN THROUGH TWO

01:22:42.023 --> 01:22:43.992
PREVIOUS COMMITTEES FOR THIS

01:22:44.059 --> 01:22:45.460
COMMITTEE. I THINK SOME OF THE

01:22:45.527 --> 01:22:47.162
MOST PERTINENT PARTS ARE THE

01:22:47.228 --> 01:22:49.130
ISSUE SURROUNDING THOSE WHO ARE

01:22:49.197 --> 01:22:50.398
CHARGED WITH MISDEMEANOR BUT ARE

01:22:50.465 --> 01:22:51.800
INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL.

01:22:51.866 --> 01:22:53.535
CURRENT SITUATION IS THOSE WHO

01:22:53.601 --> 01:22:54.836
ARE CHARGED WITH A MISDEMEANOR

01:22:54.903 --> 01:22:56.571
AND INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL

01:22:56.638 --> 01:22:58.673
ARE SIMPLY RELEASED BACK TO LIVE

01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:00.275
UNDER A BRIDGE, IF THAT'S WHERE

01:23:00.342 --> 01:23:03.011
THEY WERE ORIGINALLY FOUND. AND

01:23:03.078 --> 01:23:04.779
SADLY, THAT DOESN'T HELP EITHER

01:23:04.846 --> 01:23:07.282
THEM NOR THE PUBLIC. WHAT THIS

01:23:07.349 --> 01:23:09.417
DOES IS IT ALLOWS THEM TO BE, IN

01:23:09.484 --> 01:23:10.919
ESSENCE, ENROLLED IN CARE COURT

01:23:10.985 --> 01:23:12.687
SO THAT THEY CAN BE TREATED FOR

01:23:12.754 --> 01:23:15.557
THEIR CONDITIONS. IT ALSO

01:23:15.623 --> 01:23:17.792
PROVIDES A BIT OF AN EXPANSION

01:23:17.859 --> 01:23:20.195
OF THE POPULATION FOR WHICH CARE

01:23:20.261 --> 01:23:21.996
COURT CAN BE USED, AND THAT

01:23:22.063 --> 01:23:24.733
WOULD INCLUDE THOSE WITH MOOD

01:23:24.799 --> 01:23:26.768
DISORDERS WITH PSYCHOTIC

01:23:26.835 --> 01:23:29.337
FEATURES. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE

01:23:29.404 --> 01:23:32.006
THAT THIS EXPANSION IS A VERY

01:23:32.073 --> 01:23:33.942
SMALL EXPANSION OF THE

01:23:34.008 --> 01:23:35.643
POPULATION THAT MAY BE TREATED,

01:23:35.710 --> 01:23:38.613
MAY BE BASICALLY ENROLLED IN

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:40.815
CARE COURT. IT ALSO COMBINES

01:23:40.882 --> 01:23:41.916
HEARINGS TO MAKE IT MORE

01:23:41.983 --> 01:23:43.351
EFFICIENT FOR BOTH THE

01:23:43.418 --> 01:23:44.786
PARTICIPANTS AS WELL AS FOR THE

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:46.688
COURTS. WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY

01:23:46.755 --> 01:23:48.289
IN SUPPORT IS DOCTOR AARON

01:23:48.356 --> 01:23:50.892
MEYER, A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

01:23:50.959 --> 01:23:51.693
OFFICER FOR THE CITY OF SAN

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:54.162
DIEGO, AND MARY RUSSELL FROM THE

01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:57.365
JUDICIAL COUNCIL. THANK YOU VERY

01:23:57.432 --> 01:24:00.535
MUCH. MR. OR MISS CHAIR. THANK

01:24:00.602 --> 01:24:03.171
YOU, MR. CHAIR. AND WITH THAT, I.

01:24:03.238 --> 01:24:05.640
I'LL ASK MR. MEYER AND OR DOCTOR

01:24:05.707 --> 01:24:08.843
MEYER, EXCUSE ME AND MR. RUSSELL

01:24:08.910 --> 01:24:10.979
TESTIFY. YOU BOTH HAVE FIVE

01:24:11.045 --> 01:24:12.547
MINUTES. GOOD MORNING. MEMBERS

01:24:13.848 --> 01:24:16.084
AARON MEYER. I'M A PRACTICING

01:24:16.151 --> 01:24:16.718
PSYCHIATRIST AND ASSISTANT

01:24:16.785 --> 01:24:18.186
CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF THE

01:24:18.253 --> 01:24:19.954
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN

01:24:20.021 --> 01:24:21.389
DIEGO. WHILE I'M NOT SPEAKING ON

01:24:21.456 --> 01:24:23.224
BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY OF

01:24:23.291 --> 01:24:24.492
CALIFORNIA, I AM HERE TODAY AS

01:24:24.559 --> 01:24:26.127
THE CONTRACTED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

01:24:26.194 --> 01:24:27.662
OFFICER OF THE CITY OF SAN

01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:29.030
DIEGO, PROUD SUPPORTER OF SENATE

01:24:29.097 --> 01:24:32.567
BILL 27. ACCORDING TO A 2011

01:24:32.634 --> 01:24:34.803
NIMH STUDY, THE 12 MONTH

01:24:34.869 --> 01:24:36.271
PREVALENCE OF BIPOLAR ONE

01:24:36.337 --> 01:24:39.040
DISORDER IN THE UNITED STATES IS

01:24:39.107 --> 01:24:40.775
0.6%, WITH A LIFETIME PREVALENCE

01:24:40.842 --> 01:24:44.112
OF 1.0%. CONSISTENT WITH OTHER

01:24:44.179 --> 01:24:45.814
SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESSES.

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:48.116
HOWEVER, BIPOLAR ONE DISORDER IS

01:24:48.183 --> 01:24:49.484
OVERREPRESENTED IN PRISON

01:24:49.551 --> 01:24:50.919
POPULATIONS, WITH PREVALENCE

01:24:50.985 --> 01:24:54.122
RATES BETWEEN 2% AND 7%. BUT WE

01:24:54.189 --> 01:24:56.424
CAN REVERSE THIS TREND BY

01:24:56.491 --> 01:24:57.759
PRIORITIZING INDIVIDUALS WITH

01:24:57.826 --> 01:24:59.961
SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS IN THE

01:25:00.028 --> 01:25:01.496
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUUM OF

01:25:01.563 --> 01:25:03.598
CARE. BIPOLAR ONE DISORDER WITH

01:25:03.665 --> 01:25:05.300
PSYCHOTIC FEATURES IS A SUBSET

01:25:05.366 --> 01:25:07.168
OF THOSE WITH BIPOLAR ONE

01:25:07.235 --> 01:25:08.536
DISORDER AND DIFFERENT THAN

01:25:08.603 --> 01:25:10.405
BIPOLAR ONE WITHOUT PSYCHOTIC

01:25:10.472 --> 01:25:12.941
FEATURES, THIS SUBSET HAS MORE

01:25:13.007 --> 01:25:14.709
LIFETIME HOSPITALIZATIONS AND

01:25:14.776 --> 01:25:16.644
INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENTS. HIGHER

01:25:16.711 --> 01:25:18.179
RATES OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER,

01:25:18.246 --> 01:25:20.448
AND GREATER UNEMPLOYMENT. THIS

01:25:20.515 --> 01:25:21.850
BILL ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS

01:25:21.916 --> 01:25:24.385
SUBSET REQUIRES PRIORITIZATION.

01:25:24.452 --> 01:25:27.322
IN A STUDY CONDUCTED BY UC DAVIS

01:25:27.388 --> 01:25:29.324
RESEARCHERS, 59% OF PATIENTS

01:25:29.390 --> 01:25:31.259
WITH BIPOLAR ONE DISORDER WERE

01:25:31.326 --> 01:25:32.927
PSYCHOTIC AT THE TIME OF THEIR

01:25:32.994 --> 01:25:35.597
ARREST. SADLY, 62% OF INMATES

01:25:35.663 --> 01:25:37.398
WITH BIPOLAR DISORDER HAD

01:25:37.465 --> 01:25:38.867
RECEIVED INPATIENT TREATMENT IN

01:25:38.933 --> 01:25:40.635
THE THREE MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING

01:25:40.702 --> 01:25:43.838
THEIR ARREST WITH SB 27.

01:25:43.905 --> 01:25:44.973
INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED HELP THE

01:25:45.039 --> 01:25:46.508
MOST HAVE A GREATER CHANCE OF

01:25:46.574 --> 01:25:47.842
LINKAGE TO STABILIZING

01:25:47.909 --> 01:25:50.445
TREATMENT. ACCORDING TO THE

01:25:50.512 --> 01:25:51.746
FEBRUARY 2025 REPORT TO THE LA

01:25:51.813 --> 01:25:54.482
COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS, 59%

01:25:54.549 --> 01:25:55.783
OF CARE COURT REFERRALS CAME

01:25:55.850 --> 01:25:58.019
FROM DIVERSION, BUT IT IS

01:25:58.086 --> 01:25:59.420
UNCLEAR HOW MANY OF THESE

01:25:59.487 --> 01:26:01.489
REFERRALS ACTUALLY RESULTED IN

01:26:01.556 --> 01:26:04.492
PETITIONS. SB 27 CLARIFIES THAT

01:26:04.559 --> 01:26:06.261
REFERRALS CAN BE COUNTED AS

01:26:06.327 --> 01:26:08.730
PETITIONS. THE HOPE OF THE CARE

01:26:08.796 --> 01:26:10.164
ACT PROGRAM WAS TO PREVENT

01:26:10.231 --> 01:26:12.000
AVOIDABLE PSYCHIATRIC

01:26:12.066 --> 01:26:13.601
HOSPITALIZATIONS, INCARCERATION,

01:26:13.668 --> 01:26:15.603
AND CONSERVATORSHIPS BY OFFERING

01:26:15.670 --> 01:26:17.205
A STRUCTURED PATH TO RECOVERY

01:26:17.272 --> 01:26:18.907
AND STABILITY THROUGH A NEW

01:26:18.973 --> 01:26:21.809
CIVIL COURT PROCESS. SB 27 MOVES

01:26:21.876 --> 01:26:24.379
US CLOSER TO THIS VISION, TO

01:26:24.445 --> 01:26:26.681
THIS VISION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

01:26:26.748 --> 01:26:29.651
AND GOOD MORNING, MR. CHAIR, AND

01:26:29.717 --> 01:26:30.718
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MARY

01:26:30.785 --> 01:26:32.153
RUSSELL, ON BEHALF OF THE

01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:33.988
JUDICIAL COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA.

01:26:34.055 --> 01:26:35.356
ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT HAVE AN

01:26:35.423 --> 01:26:36.691
OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE BILL,

01:26:36.758 --> 01:26:38.593
WE WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS OUR

01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:40.962
THANKS TO THE AUTHORS OFFICE FOR

01:26:41.029 --> 01:26:42.597
HIS CONSTANT WILLINGNESS TO

01:26:42.664 --> 01:26:44.332
LISTEN TO TECHNICAL FEEDBACK

01:26:44.399 --> 01:26:46.134
FROM COURTS THAT ARE

01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:47.602
IMPLEMENTING THE CARE PROGRAM ON

01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:50.138
THE GROUND. WE WOULD ALSO LIKE

01:26:50.204 --> 01:26:52.006
TO THANK COMMITTEE STAFF FOR

01:26:52.073 --> 01:26:53.341
CONTINUING AND ENGAGING WITH US

01:26:53.408 --> 01:26:55.143
IN CONVERSATIONS TO REACH THE

01:26:55.209 --> 01:26:56.678
AGREED UPON COMMITTEE

01:26:56.744 --> 01:27:00.982
AMENDMENTS. THE TWO SUGGESTIONS

01:27:01.049 --> 01:27:02.417
FROM THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL THAT

01:27:02.483 --> 01:27:03.952
ARE RELEVANT TO THIS COMMITTEE

01:27:04.018 --> 01:27:05.553
HEAR FIRST WHAT COURTS WERE

01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:07.622
FINDING IN TERMS OF INDIVIDUALS

01:27:07.689 --> 01:27:09.223
WHO WERE INCOMPETENT TO STAND

01:27:09.290 --> 01:27:11.025
TRIAL IN MISDEMEANOR

01:27:11.092 --> 01:27:12.193
PROCEEDINGS. CURRENTLY, PENAL

01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:15.697
CODE 1370 .01 FIRST REQUIRES THE

01:27:15.763 --> 01:27:17.799
COURT TO DO AN EVALUATION TO SEE

01:27:17.865 --> 01:27:19.567
IF THE INDIVIDUAL WOULD ENTER

01:27:19.634 --> 01:27:21.135
INTO MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION

01:27:21.202 --> 01:27:22.870
BEFORE MOVING ON TO OTHER

01:27:22.937 --> 01:27:24.606
OPTIONS, INCLUDING CARE. WHAT

01:27:24.672 --> 01:27:26.274
COURTS WERE FINDING WERE THAT

01:27:26.341 --> 01:27:28.242
THERE WOULD BE SOME INDIVIDUALS

01:27:28.309 --> 01:27:30.411
FOR WHICH, YOU KNOW, IT MAY BE

01:27:30.478 --> 01:27:31.879
MORE OR LESS CLEAR THAT PERHAPS

01:27:31.946 --> 01:27:33.681
THEY WEREN'T SUITABLE CANDIDATES

01:27:33.748 --> 01:27:35.483
FOR DIVERSION, HOWEVER THEY

01:27:35.550 --> 01:27:37.251
WOULD. THERE WOULD BE TIME THAT

01:27:37.318 --> 01:27:39.153
THEY WOULD HAVE TO SPEND

01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:40.154
LANGUISHING WHILE THE COURTS

01:27:40.221 --> 01:27:42.256
UNDERGO THAT DIVERSION

01:27:42.323 --> 01:27:44.058
ASSESSMENT. AND SO PART OF OUR

01:27:44.125 --> 01:27:45.927
SUGGESTIONS WERE TO MOVE THE

01:27:45.994 --> 01:27:49.163
CARE ELIGIBILITY PORTION UP SO

01:27:49.230 --> 01:27:52.100
THAT A PERSON CAN BE EVALUATED

01:27:52.166 --> 01:27:53.901
FOR MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION AND

01:27:53.968 --> 01:27:55.570
CARE PROCEEDINGS AT THE SAME

01:27:55.637 --> 01:27:57.438
TIME. AND TO THAT END, IN TERMS

01:27:57.505 --> 01:28:00.308
OF OUR SECOND SUGGESTION

01:28:00.375 --> 01:28:03.578
RELEVANT TO THIS COMMITTEE WAS

01:28:03.645 --> 01:28:05.446
WE BELIEVE THAT WHEN IT COMES TO

01:28:05.513 --> 01:28:06.648
THE REFERRAL AND PETITION

01:28:06.714 --> 01:28:08.149
PROCESS, WE SAW THAT THERE WAS A

01:28:08.216 --> 01:28:09.784
LITTLE BIT OF LAG TIME IN TERMS

01:28:09.851 --> 01:28:12.353
OF THE TIME FROM WHEN THE

01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:12.920
CRIMINAL COURT WOULD REFER A

01:28:12.987 --> 01:28:15.757
CASE TO THE CARE COURT, AND SO

01:28:15.823 --> 01:28:17.492
WHAT OUR AMENDMENTS DO IS

01:28:17.558 --> 01:28:19.627
CLARIFY THAT IF A COURT IS

01:28:19.694 --> 01:28:21.796
REFERRING AN INDIVIDUAL OVER TO

01:28:21.863 --> 01:28:24.165
CARE, THAT IF THE REFERRAL MEETS

01:28:24.232 --> 01:28:26.167
THE REQUIREMENTS OF A PETITION,

01:28:26.234 --> 01:28:27.468
THAT IT COULD BE TREATED AS A

01:28:27.535 --> 01:28:29.737
PETITION FOR CARE PURPOSES IN

01:28:29.804 --> 01:28:31.606
ORDER TO HELP EXPEDITE THE

01:28:31.673 --> 01:28:34.075
PROCESS AND GET THE INDIVIDUAL

01:28:34.142 --> 01:28:36.911
THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED.

01:28:36.978 --> 01:28:38.713
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:39.747

01:29:39.974 --> 01:29:41.442
MORNING. VICE CHAIR MEMBERS

MICHELLE CABRERA WITH THE COUNTY

01:29:42.810 --> 01:29:44.178
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS

01:29:44.245 --> 01:29:46.547
ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. AND

01:29:46.614 --> 01:29:48.983
WE ARE IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION

01:29:49.050 --> 01:29:52.887
OF SB 27 FROM THE VANTAGE POINT

01:29:52.954 --> 01:29:54.655
OF COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

01:29:54.722 --> 01:29:56.557
DIRECTORS WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED

01:29:56.624 --> 01:29:58.392
IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CARE

01:29:58.459 --> 01:30:02.530
COURT SINCE OCTOBER 2023, THIS

01:30:02.597 --> 01:30:04.699
BILL IS MUCH MORE THAN A MERE

01:30:04.766 --> 01:30:06.667
CLEANUP OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE

01:30:06.734 --> 01:30:09.470
CARE ACT, AND IN FACT, BY

01:30:09.537 --> 01:30:12.340
BLURRING THE LINES BETWEEN CARE

01:30:12.406 --> 01:30:15.109
COURT, WHICH IS INTENDED AS A

01:30:15.176 --> 01:30:17.645
VOLUNTARY CIVIL COURT PROCESS,

01:30:17.712 --> 01:30:20.148
ALONG WITH THE CRIMINAL

01:30:20.214 --> 01:30:23.417
PROCEEDINGS THAT TAKE PLACE

01:30:23.484 --> 01:30:26.420
UNDER AN INCOMPETENT TO STAND

01:30:26.487 --> 01:30:29.090
TRIAL REFERRAL. WE ARE CONCERNED

01:30:29.157 --> 01:30:31.025
THAT THIS WILL LEAD TO ALTERING

01:30:31.092 --> 01:30:33.161
THE VERY NATURE OF CARE COURT

01:30:33.227 --> 01:30:37.532
FROM A VOLUNTARY TO A COERCIVE

01:30:37.598 --> 01:30:39.433
MEASURE, BY PROVIDING BOTH

01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:40.701
CARROTS AND STICKS. AND I'LL

01:30:40.768 --> 01:30:42.937
EXPLAIN THIS. WHAT THIS BILL

01:30:43.004 --> 01:30:45.206
DOES IS IT SAYS THAT IF A PERSON

01:30:45.273 --> 01:30:46.974
IS ESTE AND THEY'RE REFERRED

01:30:47.041 --> 01:30:50.311
INTO CARE COURT WITHIN SIX

01:30:50.378 --> 01:30:52.713
MONTHS, CARE CAN REFER THAT

01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:54.081
INDIVIDUAL BACK TO CRIMINAL

01:30:54.148 --> 01:30:55.883
PROCEEDINGS. IT DOESN'T PROVIDE

01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:59.253
GUIDANCE ON WHEN, WHY OR HOW WE

01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:01.556
WOULD ESTABLISH THIS REFERRAL

01:31:01.622 --> 01:31:05.993
BACK TO THE COURT. AND TO BE

01:31:06.060 --> 01:31:08.529
CLEAR, IN ADDITION, WE ALSO

01:31:08.596 --> 01:31:10.631
APPRECIATE THAT THE GOAL OF

01:31:10.698 --> 01:31:12.266
CLOSING THESE LOOPHOLES AND

01:31:12.333 --> 01:31:14.268
ALLOWING PEOPLE TO COME DIRECTLY

01:31:14.335 --> 01:31:16.337
INTO CARE COURT IS THE

01:31:16.404 --> 01:31:17.905
INTENTION. WE THINK THAT THE WAY

01:31:17.972 --> 01:31:19.707
THAT THIS LANGUAGE IS

01:31:19.774 --> 01:31:21.776
STRUCTURED, IT ACTUALLY LEAVES

01:31:21.843 --> 01:31:23.578
US AND THE CLIENTS THAT WE'RE

01:31:23.644 --> 01:31:24.779
SEEKING TO SERVE, MORE

01:31:24.846 --> 01:31:27.348
VULNERABLE TO THEM FACING

01:31:27.415 --> 01:31:28.683
EXACTLY THE FATE THAT THE

01:31:28.749 --> 01:31:30.718
SENATOR IS TRYING TO AVOID.

01:31:30.785 --> 01:31:32.119
CURRENTLY, IN OUR EXPERIENCE,

01:31:32.186 --> 01:31:34.388
WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE

01:31:34.455 --> 01:31:37.024
COURTS TO DEVELOP SORT OF A PRE

01:31:37.091 --> 01:31:39.393
PETITION PROCESS AND TO GET THAT

01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:40.862
IN PLACE PRIOR TO THE

01:31:40.928 --> 01:31:42.330
INDIVIDUAL'S RELEASE UNDER THE

01:31:42.396 --> 01:31:43.831
LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL, IT WOULD

01:31:43.898 --> 01:31:46.000
SPEED UP CERTAIN ELEMENTS AND,

01:31:46.067 --> 01:31:48.102
AND STILL LEAVE THOSE PEOPLE

01:31:48.169 --> 01:31:49.537
VULNERABLE TO BEING RELEASED

01:31:49.604 --> 01:31:50.905
WITHOUT OUR KNOWLEDGE AND

01:31:50.972 --> 01:31:52.173
FRANKLY, WITHOUT THE INFORMATION

01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:55.142
WE NEED. CURRENTLY, WHEN WE GET

01:31:55.209 --> 01:31:56.444
A REFERRAL FROM A CRIMINAL

01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:57.845
COURT, IT IS A MINUTE ORDER. IT

01:31:57.912 --> 01:31:59.280
INCLUDES THE DEFENDANT'S NAME

01:31:59.347 --> 01:32:00.548
AND THE FACILITY THAT THEY'RE

01:32:00.615 --> 01:32:02.516
BEING DISCHARGED FROM LITTLE

01:32:02.583 --> 01:32:05.419
ELSE. SO WE ARE VERY CONCERNED

01:32:05.486 --> 01:32:06.721
WITH THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL.

01:32:06.787 --> 01:32:08.689
I WILL NOTE THAT COUNTY

01:32:08.756 --> 01:32:10.458
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS AND

01:32:10.524 --> 01:32:11.759
THE PRACTITIONERS WHO HAVE BEEN

01:32:11.826 --> 01:32:13.861
IMPLEMENTING CARE COURT HAVE NOT

01:32:13.928 --> 01:32:15.096
BEEN CONSULTED, AND WE REALLY

01:32:15.162 --> 01:32:17.665
WOULD APPRECIATE AN OPPORTUNITY

01:32:17.732 --> 01:32:19.066
TO INFORM THE LANGUAGE BASED ON

01:32:19.133 --> 01:32:21.168
OUR DIRECT EXPERIENCE. I THINK

01:32:21.235 --> 01:32:22.970
THAT WE SHARE, AGAIN, THE GOAL

01:32:23.037 --> 01:32:24.639
OF MAKING SURE THAT INDIVIDUALS

01:32:24.705 --> 01:32:26.274
WITH SIGNIFICANT MENTAL HEALTH

01:32:26.340 --> 01:32:27.508
CONDITIONS ARE NOT CRIMINALIZED

01:32:27.575 --> 01:32:29.210
AND THAT, WHEN POSSIBLE, THEY

01:32:29.277 --> 01:32:33.748
ARE SENT TO TREATMENT INSTEAD OF

01:32:33.814 --> 01:32:36.851
INCARCERATION. THANK YOU. THANK

01:32:36.918 --> 01:32:39.553
YOU, HONORABLE CHAIR AND PUBLIC

01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:42.089
SAFETY COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY

01:32:42.156 --> 01:32:43.824
NAME IS LESLIE NAPPER. I'M A

01:32:43.891 --> 01:32:45.660
MOTHER, GRANDMOTHER, AUNT. I'M

01:32:45.726 --> 01:32:47.061
AN ACTIVE COMMUNITY MEMBER AND

01:32:47.128 --> 01:32:49.597
PROUD SACRAMENTO. AND I ALSO

01:32:49.664 --> 01:32:51.899
LIVE WITH BIPOLAR ONE DISORDER

01:32:51.966 --> 01:32:54.402
WITH PSYCHOTIC FEATURES. I AM A

01:32:54.468 --> 01:32:56.070
I WORK WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS

01:32:56.137 --> 01:32:58.239
CALIFORNIA AS A SENIOR ADVOCATE,

01:32:58.306 --> 01:33:02.243
AND I URGE YOU TO OPPOSE SB 27.

01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:04.412
SB 27 WOULD MASSIVELY EXPAND

01:33:04.478 --> 01:33:06.280
CARE COURT ELIGIBILITY, PUTTING

01:33:06.347 --> 01:33:08.082
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

01:33:08.149 --> 01:33:09.784
CALIFORNIANS LIKE ME AT RISK OF

01:33:09.850 --> 01:33:11.953
BEING PULLED INTO THE SYSTEM.

01:33:12.019 --> 01:33:13.821
COUNTIES ESTIMATE THAT SB 27

01:33:13.888 --> 01:33:15.823
WOULD INCREASE THE NUMBERS OF

01:33:15.890 --> 01:33:17.725
PEOPLE SWEPT INTO AN INEFFECTIVE

01:33:17.792 --> 01:33:21.429
CARE COURT PROGRAM BY EIGHT

01:33:21.495 --> 01:33:23.297
TIMES. CARE COURT IS NOT

01:33:23.364 --> 01:33:25.299
EVIDENCE BASED. THERE'S NO DATA

01:33:25.366 --> 01:33:26.667
THAT IT PROVES THAT IT HELPS

01:33:26.734 --> 01:33:29.236
PEOPLE RECOVER. HOWEVER, IT CAN

01:33:29.303 --> 01:33:32.206
HAVE DIRE CONSEQUENCES FOR

01:33:32.273 --> 01:33:36.544
PEOPLE LIKE ME IF WE DON'T

01:33:36.610 --> 01:33:38.212
COMPLY WITH THE CARE. WITH CARE

01:33:38.279 --> 01:33:42.550
COURT, WE RISK BEING PLACED IN

01:33:42.616 --> 01:33:44.685
CONSERVATORSHIP AND LOSING OUR

01:33:44.752 --> 01:33:47.488
RIGHTS TO CHOOSE WHERE WE LIVE

01:33:47.555 --> 01:33:49.724
OR HAVE INFORMED MEDICAL

01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:52.460
DECISION MAKING, HOW WE SPEND

01:33:52.526 --> 01:33:54.495
OUR MONEY, OR EVEN OUR WHETHER

01:33:54.562 --> 01:33:57.765
OR NOT WE CAN VOTE AS A PERSON

01:33:57.832 --> 01:33:59.567
OF COLOR. I AM DEEPLY ALARMED.

01:33:59.633 --> 01:34:01.802
IN SOME COUNTIES, BLACK AND

01:34:01.869 --> 01:34:03.604
INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES ARE OVER

01:34:03.671 --> 01:34:04.839
TWICE AS LIKELY TO BE

01:34:04.905 --> 01:34:06.941
PETITIONED. THE DATA SHOWS THE

01:34:07.008 --> 01:34:07.775
SIGNIFICANT THERE ARE

01:34:07.842 --> 01:34:09.443
SIGNIFICANT RACIAL DISPARITIES

01:34:09.510 --> 01:34:11.312
IN WHO IT IMPACTS AND THAT

01:34:11.379 --> 01:34:13.147
PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING THE

01:34:13.214 --> 01:34:14.949
SERVICES THEY NEED THROUGH IT.

01:34:15.016 --> 01:34:16.884
THROUGH IT CARE COURT DOES NOT

01:34:16.951 --> 01:34:19.620
PAY FOR CARE LIKE TREATMENT OR

01:34:19.687 --> 01:34:21.422
HOUSING. INSTEAD, IT FUNNELS

01:34:21.489 --> 01:34:22.757
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS

01:34:22.823 --> 01:34:25.092
INTO THE LEGAL PROCESS. CARE

01:34:25.159 --> 01:34:27.528
COURT COSTS OVER $700,000 PER

01:34:27.595 --> 01:34:29.730
PERSON. THAT COULD BE BETTER

01:34:29.797 --> 01:34:31.966
SPENT ON COMMUNITY RESPONSIVE

01:34:32.033 --> 01:34:34.035
SERVICES, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

01:34:34.101 --> 01:34:35.836
SERVICES, PEER SUPPORT AND

01:34:35.903 --> 01:34:37.405
PROVEN COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES

01:34:37.471 --> 01:34:39.373
LIKE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS

01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:42.676
WITH FIDELITY TO ACT THAT ALSO

01:34:42.743 --> 01:34:45.012
PROVIDE WRAPAROUND SERVICES FOR

01:34:45.079 --> 01:34:47.481
THOSE OF US THAT BENEFIT. THANK

01:34:47.548 --> 01:34:50.985
YOU SIR, AM I OVER? MAY I CLOSE?

01:34:51.052 --> 01:34:51.519
YES. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I

01:34:51.585 --> 01:34:54.021
APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND GRACE.

01:34:54.088 --> 01:34:55.222
I AM ONE OF THOUSANDS OF

01:34:55.289 --> 01:34:56.757
CALIFORNIANS LIVING WITH BIPOLAR

01:34:56.824 --> 01:34:58.159
DISORDER WITH PSYCHOTIC

01:34:58.225 --> 01:34:59.860
FEATURES. WE ARE YOUR NEIGHBORS,

01:34:59.927 --> 01:35:02.229
YOUR COWORKERS, AND YOUR LOVED

01:35:02.296 --> 01:35:04.832
ONES. WHAT WE NEED IS REAL CARE

01:35:04.899 --> 01:35:06.500
AND IT'S NOT FOUND IN A

01:35:06.567 --> 01:35:08.335
COURTROOM. PLEASE PROTECT US AND

ANY QUESTIONS? COMMENTS? MR.

01:40:22.316 --> 01:40:28.188
LACKEY? ONCE AGAIN, WE HAVE AN

01:40:28.255 --> 01:40:29.089
AWKWARD REALITY THAT WE'RE

01:40:29.156 --> 01:40:31.959
TRYING TO MANAGE. WHAT WE HAVE

01:40:32.025 --> 01:40:34.495
IS WE HAVE PEOPLE WITH EXTREME

01:40:34.561 --> 01:40:38.632
DISABILITY, AND I, I ADMIRE THE

01:40:38.699 --> 01:40:40.601
OPPOSITION FOR FIGHTING FOR

01:40:40.667 --> 01:40:43.370
LIBERTY. I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S

01:40:43.437 --> 01:40:45.239
VERY NATURAL TO UNDERSTAND THAT

01:40:45.305 --> 01:40:47.608
PIECE. BUT THERE'S ANOTHER PART

01:40:47.674 --> 01:40:49.610
OF THIS THAT NEEDS TO REALLY BE

01:40:49.676 --> 01:40:52.713
ADMITTED TO. AND THE SYSTEM WE

01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:55.015
HAVE NOW IS WHAT CRIMINALIZES

01:40:55.082 --> 01:40:56.817
PEOPLE HAVING WORE A BADGE, I

01:40:56.884 --> 01:40:59.353
KNOW WHEN WE TAKE PEOPLE FOR

01:40:59.420 --> 01:41:02.489
5150, IT'S A FORM OF CUSTODY.

01:41:02.556 --> 01:41:05.692
AND NO MATTER WHAT WE DO, WE

01:41:05.759 --> 01:41:08.362
HAVE TO HELP THESE PEOPLE

01:41:08.429 --> 01:41:09.696
SOMETIMES PROTECT THEM AGAINST

01:41:09.763 --> 01:41:12.566
THEMSELVES. AND AS DIFFICULT AS

01:41:12.633 --> 01:41:14.935
THAT SOUNDS, THAT REALLY IS THE

01:41:15.002 --> 01:41:18.539
TRUTH WE ALL HAVE SEEN THE

01:41:18.605 --> 01:41:20.107
DISHEARTENING CIRCUMSTANCES AND

01:41:20.174 --> 01:41:22.242
REALITY OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE,

01:41:22.309 --> 01:41:25.446
QUOTE UNQUOTE, CHOSEN TO LIVE

01:41:25.512 --> 01:41:28.449
THE WAY THEY ARE LIVING. I DON'T

01:41:28.515 --> 01:41:31.652
THINK PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE

01:41:31.718 --> 01:41:34.688
GRAVITY OF HOW BAD IT IS. MAYBE

01:41:34.755 --> 01:41:37.324
YOU DO, BUT IF YOU UNDERSTAND

01:41:37.391 --> 01:41:41.061
THE GRAVITY OF HOW SEVERE THESE

01:41:41.128 --> 01:41:43.797
CONDITIONS ARE, YOU WOULD WANT

01:41:43.864 --> 01:41:45.999
TO SHOW CARE. AND THAT'S WHY

01:41:46.066 --> 01:41:48.669
THIS HAS BEEN LABELED AS SUCH. A

01:41:48.735 --> 01:41:51.738
LOT OF PEOPLE MISINTERPRET

01:41:51.805 --> 01:41:54.374
TAKING CONTROL OF SOMEBODY WHO

01:41:54.441 --> 01:41:58.011
IS OUT OF CONTROL, AS UNCARING

01:41:58.078 --> 01:42:01.281
AS CRIMINALIZATION. AND I FIND

01:42:01.348 --> 01:42:05.018
THAT TO BE MISGUIDED BECAUSE I'M

01:42:05.085 --> 01:42:07.888
TELLING YOU, MY LIFE EXPERIENCE

01:42:07.955 --> 01:42:10.557
IS ONE THAT HAS OPENED MY EYES

01:42:10.624 --> 01:42:13.327
TO THIS PROBLEM VERY, VERY

01:42:13.393 --> 01:42:15.629
LOUDLY. AND IT CONTINUES TO BE A

01:42:15.696 --> 01:42:18.098
DEEP CONCERN OF MINE. AND WHAT

01:42:18.165 --> 01:42:19.900
WE GOT TO REMEMBER IS THE

01:42:19.967 --> 01:42:23.871
DIAGNOSIS HAS TO BE SEVERE. AND

01:42:23.937 --> 01:42:27.074
BECAUSE OF THAT, WE HAVE TO TRY

01:42:27.140 --> 01:42:29.109
TO IMPROVE THE CIRCUMSTANCES

01:42:29.176 --> 01:42:31.778
THAT PEOPLE HAVE, QUOTE UNQUOTE,

01:42:31.845 --> 01:42:34.681
CHOSEN. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY

01:42:34.748 --> 01:42:38.352
CHOOSES TO LIVE ON THE STREETS

01:42:38.418 --> 01:42:41.154
SCAVENGING THROUGH ANY PATHWAY

01:42:41.221 --> 01:42:43.557
AT ALL JUST TO GET FOOD. I'VE

01:42:43.624 --> 01:42:46.593
SEEN IT. PEOPLE RIFLING THROUGH

01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:48.395
DUMPSTERS, RIFLING THROUGH

01:42:48.462 --> 01:42:51.098
TRASH. THAT'S NOT HUMANE, THAT'S

01:42:51.164 --> 01:42:54.134
NOT CARING. WHAT'S CARING IS

01:42:54.201 --> 01:42:57.304
TRYING TO TAKE CONTROL AND OFFER

01:42:57.371 --> 01:43:00.307
ASSISTANCE. AND I, I UNDERSTAND

01:43:00.374 --> 01:43:01.909
THAT THE VOLUNTARY ADMISSION,

01:43:01.975 --> 01:43:03.443
IT'S WORTHY OF DEBATE. WE NEED

01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:04.978
TO DEBATE THIS. WE NEED TO

01:43:05.045 --> 01:43:06.413
DISCUSS IT AND MAKE SURE THAT

01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:09.449
THIS IS A LAST RESORT OF TAKING

01:43:09.516 --> 01:43:11.051
CONTROL AND ROBBING PEOPLE OF

01:43:11.118 --> 01:43:13.587
THEIR LIBERTY. BUT I TELL YOU,

01:43:13.654 --> 01:43:15.622
THERE ARE MANY, MANY, MANY

01:43:15.689 --> 01:43:17.858
CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THIS IS IN

01:43:17.925 --> 01:43:20.694
DEMAND. WE'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND

01:43:20.761 --> 01:43:23.697
THAT ALTHOUGH IT FEELS LOUSY, WE

01:43:23.764 --> 01:43:25.766
HAVE TO HELP THEM. WE HAVE TO

01:43:25.832 --> 01:43:27.601
HELP THEM, MAN. AND WE'RE NOT

01:43:27.668 --> 01:43:28.735
HELPING THEM BY LETTING THEM

01:43:28.802 --> 01:43:30.103
JUST STAY IN THAT CONDITION.

01:43:30.170 --> 01:43:33.173
THAT'S NOT HELP. IT'S SOMETHING

01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:35.175
MUCH DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT'S

01:43:35.242 --> 01:43:38.111
OUTCOME BASED. SO THERE'S

01:43:38.178 --> 01:43:39.513
STUDIES, THERE'S DATA AND

01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:41.815
THERE'S REALITY. WE ALL KNOW THE

01:43:41.882 --> 01:43:44.818
REALITY, FOLKS. IT IS BROKEN AND

01:43:44.885 --> 01:43:47.287
WE NEED TO DO BETTER. AND I

01:43:47.354 --> 01:43:49.556
THINK THAT THIS IS A STEP TO TRY

01:43:49.623 --> 01:43:51.992
TO DO BETTER. IT'S NOT WITHOUT

01:43:52.059 --> 01:43:55.596
DEBATE. IT'S NOT NOT WITHOUT

01:43:55.662 --> 01:43:56.663
ENGAGEMENT. BUT LET'S BE HONEST.

01:43:56.730 --> 01:43:58.031
LET'S BE HONEST WITH EACH OTHER

01:43:58.098 --> 01:44:00.267
AND LET'S SHOW WHAT REAL CARE

01:44:00.334 --> 01:44:03.236
IS. AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A

01:44:03.303 --> 01:44:04.638
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, SO

01:44:04.705 --> 01:44:07.874
THAT'S WHY I'LL SUPPORT IT.

01:44:07.941 --> 01:44:08.942
THANK YOU, MR. LACKEY. ANYONE

01:44:09.009 --> 01:44:12.479

ASSOCIATION IN RESPECTFUL

01:46:16.403 --> 01:46:19.406
OPPOSITION. UNLESS IT IS AMENDED

01:46:19.473 --> 01:46:21.041
TO DELETE THE PORTION OF THE

01:46:21.108 --> 01:46:23.310
BILL THAT EXPANDS THE ABILITY TO

OBTAIN A SEARCH WARRANT FOR YET

01:46:25.112 --> 01:46:27.380
ANOTHER MISDEMEANOR. THE PORTION

01:46:27.447 --> 01:46:30.083
OF THE BILL THAT WE OBJECT TO IS

01:46:30.150 --> 01:46:32.152
NEW. SECTION, SUBSECTION

01:46:32.219 --> 01:46:34.354
SUBDIVISION 23 OF THE PENAL

01:46:34.421 --> 01:46:37.224
CODE, SECTION 1524, WHICH COVERS

01:46:37.290 --> 01:46:39.826
THE ISSUANCE OF SEARCH WARRANTS.

01:46:39.893 --> 01:46:42.095
SUBDIVISION 23 WOULD EXPAND THE

EXPANSION IS UNNECESSARY. PRICE

01:46:57.878 --> 01:46:59.246
GOUGING IS A MISDEMEANOR, AND

WARRANTS TO INVESTIGATE

01:47:07.954 --> 01:47:10.090
MISDEMEANOR OFFENSES. IT'S

01:47:10.157 --> 01:47:11.625
LIKELY THAT THE BAD ACTORS WHO

FURTHER, THERE ARE QUITE A FEW

01:47:29.609 --> 01:47:31.278
CASES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN

01:47:31.344 --> 01:47:34.114
CHARGED ALLEGING PRICE GOUGING.

01:47:34.181 --> 01:47:35.615
THERE ARE NO CONVICTIONS AS THE

01:47:37.484 --> 01:47:40.020

DISPLACED BY THE EVACUATION

01:51:52.138 --> 01:51:54.307

SAW IT ON TV. WE HEARD IT ON

01:51:56.676 --> 01:52:00.380

THESE INDIVIDUALS DISGUISED

01:52:03.783 --> 01:52:05.318
THEMSELVES. CAN YOU IMAGINE AS

FIREFIGHTERS, FEMA WORKERS AND

01:52:07.053 --> 01:52:09.022
EVEN LAW ENFORCEMENT TO GAIN

THEIR HOMES AND LOST THEIR

01:52:18.898 --> 01:52:22.335
POSSESSIONS? THESE THESE ABUSERS

01:52:22.402 --> 01:52:24.737
ENGAGE IN LOOTING AND PROPERTY

01:52:24.804 --> 01:52:27.340
THEFT, RAMPAGING THROUGH THE

ASHES OF VICTIMS IN THEIR HOMES

01:52:29.442 --> 01:52:32.145
AND PERSONAL BELONGINGS. HOW

01:52:32.212 --> 01:52:32.912

THE FAMILIES TO FIND OUT THAT

AND TO THEIR PERSONAL

01:52:38.685 --> 01:52:41.054

COMMUNITIES AND VICTIMS OF

01:52:47.293 --> 01:52:49.996
PERSONAL PROPERTY. COMMUNITIES

01:52:50.063 --> 01:52:51.564
CAN'T TRUST THE DIRECTIONS OF

01:52:51.631 --> 01:52:53.867
PUBLIC SAFETY AND THE OFFICIALS

01:52:53.933 --> 01:52:56.669
IF THEY ARE UNSURE WHO TO TRUST,

01:52:56.736 --> 01:52:58.705
WHO'S WEARING THE UNIFORM, WHO

CHERISHED BELONGINGS ARE SAFELY

01:53:05.812 --> 01:53:08.815
LEFT BEHIND AND PROTECTED BY

01:53:08.882 --> 01:53:11.818
LAWFULLY AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS.

01:53:11.885 --> 01:53:14.287
THESE ABUSERS AND THEIR ACTIONS

01:53:14.354 --> 01:53:16.789
UNDERMINE EVACUATION ORDERS.

01:53:16.856 --> 01:53:18.992
OFFICIALS WITH AUTHORITY TO MOVE

01:53:19.058 --> 01:53:22.061
THE VICTIMS AND TO MOVE THE

01:53:22.128 --> 01:53:24.731
INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE VICTIMIZED

01:53:24.797 --> 01:53:26.533
BY SOME OF THESE INDIVIDUALS

01:53:26.599 --> 01:53:29.702
BECAUSE OF THE FIRES. WE'VE GOT

01:53:29.769 --> 01:53:31.437
TO GIVE THESE VICTIMS PEACE OF

01:53:31.504 --> 01:53:33.973
MIND. TRAGEDIES WILL HAPPEN

01:53:34.040 --> 01:53:37.710
AGAIN. LET'S MAKE SURE THAT

01:53:37.777 --> 01:53:40.146
IMPERSONATORS AREN'T INVOLVED AT

01:53:40.213 --> 01:53:42.448
ALL, ENSURING THAT THE PUBLIC

01:53:42.515 --> 01:53:44.617
CAN TRUST FIRST RESPONDERS AND

01:53:44.684 --> 01:53:47.053
LOCAL PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICIALS IS

01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:48.755
CRUCIAL IN KEEPING COMMUNITIES

01:53:48.821 --> 01:53:50.623
SAFE, ESPECIALLY DURING THE

01:53:50.690 --> 01:53:52.325
STATE OF EMERGENCIES WHEN

01:53:52.392 --> 01:53:56.296
VICTIMS ARE IN THEIR DISARRAY.

01:53:56.362 --> 01:53:59.232
AGAIN. THE STATES OF EMERGENCY

01:53:59.299 --> 01:54:02.869
SENATE BILL 571 IS A CLEAR SIGN.

OF THE BILL. I JUST WANT TO SAY

01:55:45.772 --> 01:55:47.507
THAT OUR PENAL CODE IS SUPPOSED

01:55:47.573 --> 01:55:48.174
TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE

01:55:48.241 --> 01:55:50.543
SEVERITY OF CRIMES AND THE

PUNISHMENT CREATED THEREIN. AND

01:55:53.413 --> 01:55:54.847
OBVIOUSLY, AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM

01:55:54.914 --> 01:55:56.382
THE AUTHOR AND WITNESSES AND AS

01:55:56.449 --> 01:55:58.318
I'VE TALKED TO THE CHIEFS, THE

01:55:58.384 --> 01:55:59.585
SEVERITY OF THESE CRIMES

01:55:59.652 --> 01:56:00.687
COMMITTED IN THE AFTERMATH OF

01:56:00.753 --> 01:56:02.689
THE FIRE, THE LOOTING, THE

01:56:02.755 --> 01:56:03.856
IMPERSONATING THE OFFICER, THE

01:56:03.923 --> 01:56:05.892
DAMAGE IT CAUSES NOT JUST TO THE

01:56:05.958 --> 01:56:07.226
AGENCIES BUT TO THE INDIVIDUALS

01:56:07.293 --> 01:56:09.562
WHOSE PROPERTY IS, IS STOLEN AND

01:56:09.629 --> 01:56:10.963
THE TRUST THAT IS LOST TO THE

01:56:13.966 --> 01:56:15.435
EMERGENCY LIKE THIS IS MUCH,

01:56:15.501 --> 01:56:17.170
MUCH MORE SEVERE THAN THE

01:56:17.236 --> 01:56:18.371
CURRENT PENALTY SYSTEM THAT WE

01:56:18.438 --> 01:56:20.606
HAD IN PLACE WHEN WE REVIEWED

01:56:20.673 --> 01:56:21.641
THIS AFTER THE FACT. AND SO WE

01:56:21.708 --> 01:56:22.542
THINK THAT INCREASING THE

01:56:22.608 --> 01:56:24.911
PENALTIES IN THE WAYS THAT THESE

01:56:24.977 --> 01:56:25.845
TWO BILLS ARE DOING THIS YEAR

01:56:25.912 --> 01:56:27.480
ARE IMPORTANT, MEANINGFUL AND

01:56:27.547 --> 01:56:29.048
APPROPRIATE. AGAIN, GIVEN THE

01:56:29.115 --> 01:56:31.884
SEVERITY OF THE CRIMES THAT WE

01:56:31.951 --> 01:56:32.518

01:56:32.585 --> 01:56:35.054

A JUDGE ADVOCATE WITH ACLU

01:57:59.572 --> 01:58:00.840
CALIFORNIA ACTION. I WANT TO

01:58:00.907 --> 01:58:02.975
START BY THANKING THE AUTHOR FOR

01:58:03.042 --> 01:58:03.709
TAKING AMENDMENTS THAT DID

01:58:03.776 --> 01:58:05.178
ADDRESS MANY OF OUR CONCERNS.

01:58:05.244 --> 01:58:06.679
HOWEVER, WE STILL CONTINUE TO

01:58:06.746 --> 01:58:08.114
HAVE VERY SERIOUS CONCERNS WITH

01:58:08.181 --> 01:58:09.449
THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'RE

01:58:09.515 --> 01:58:11.250
ACCEPTING, AND WHAT'S IN PRINT

01:58:11.317 --> 01:58:13.085
IS IMPORTANT TO REMIND EVERYONE

01:58:13.152 --> 01:58:14.921
THAT EXISTING LAW ALREADY

01:58:14.987 --> 01:58:16.155
IMPOSES SEVERE PENALTIES FOR THE

01:58:16.222 --> 01:58:18.057
FALSE IMPERSONATION OF EMERGENCY

01:58:18.124 --> 01:58:20.259
PERSONNEL AS A MISDEMEANOR, AND

01:58:20.326 --> 01:58:21.727
STRONG EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT

01:58:21.794 --> 01:58:23.196
LONGER CRIMINAL SENTENCES HAS

01:58:23.262 --> 01:58:25.298
FAILED TO PROMOTE DETERRENCE.

01:58:25.364 --> 01:58:26.799
THIS NOTION IS SUPPORTED BY THE

01:58:26.866 --> 01:58:28.034
FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE,

01:58:28.100 --> 01:58:29.702
WHICH DISCOURAGES INCREASING

01:58:29.769 --> 01:58:31.037
EXISTING PUNISHMENTS, NOTING

01:58:31.103 --> 01:58:32.572
THAT LONGER SENTENCING DOES

01:58:32.638 --> 01:58:35.041
LITTLE TO DETER CRIME. OTHER

01:58:35.107 --> 01:58:36.442
FINDINGS HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE

01:58:36.509 --> 01:58:38.277
CERTAINTY OF PUNISHMENT THAT

01:58:38.344 --> 01:58:39.378
SOMEONE WILL BE PUNISHED FOR

01:58:39.445 --> 01:58:40.913
PARTICULAR CRIME HAS A GREATER

01:58:40.980 --> 01:58:41.848
DETERRENCE EFFECT THAN THE

01:58:41.914 --> 01:58:43.049
SEVERITY OF THE PUNISHMENT

01:58:43.115 --> 01:58:45.585
ITSELF. I IMPLORE EVERY MEMBER

01:58:45.651 --> 01:58:47.353
IN THIS COMMITTEE TO FOLLOW THE

01:58:47.420 --> 01:58:48.654
EVIDENCE AND TO NOT MOVE FORWARD

01:58:48.721 --> 01:58:50.089
WITH THE TIRED AND FAILED

01:58:50.156 --> 01:58:51.524
CARCERAL SOLUTIONS OF TOUGH ON

01:58:51.591 --> 01:58:53.926
CRIME POLICIES THAT HAVE RAVAGED

01:58:53.993 --> 01:58:56.229
OUR COMMUNITIES. IT IS NO

01:58:56.295 --> 01:58:57.330
COINCIDENCE WHY THIS NATION HAS

01:58:57.396 --> 01:58:58.498
THE HIGHEST INCARCERATION RATE

01:58:58.564 --> 01:58:59.899
IN THE WORLD, MAKING UP LESS

01:58:59.966 --> 01:59:01.634
THAN 5% OF THE WORLD'S

01:59:01.701 --> 01:59:03.069
POPULATION, BUT NEARLY A QUARTER

01:59:03.135 --> 01:59:05.204
OF ITS PRISON POPULATION. AND

01:59:05.271 --> 01:59:06.672
IT'S BECAUSE WE CONTINUE TO PASS

01:59:06.739 --> 01:59:08.407
POLICIES THAT CONTRADICT

01:59:08.474 --> 01:59:09.442
EVIDENCE AND LOCK PEOPLE UP FOR

01:59:09.509 --> 01:59:11.277
AN EGREGIOUS AMOUNT OF TIME,

01:59:11.344 --> 01:59:12.478
RATHER THAN FOCUSING OUR ENERGY

01:59:12.545 --> 01:59:14.981
ON THE ROOT CAUSES OF CRIME, WE

01:59:15.047 --> 01:59:16.048
HAVE TO HONESTLY ASK OURSELVES

01:59:16.115 --> 01:59:17.450
WHAT THE PURPOSE IS AND

01:59:17.517 --> 01:59:18.784
INCREASING CRIMINAL SENTENCES

01:59:18.851 --> 01:59:19.986
WHEN THERE'S SO MUCH EVIDENCE

01:59:20.052 --> 01:59:21.854
THAT IT DOES NOTHING TO DETER

01:59:21.921 --> 01:59:25.491
CRIME AND COST TAXPAYERS ROUGHLY

01:59:25.558 --> 01:59:26.526
$130,000 TO INCARCERATE EACH

01:59:26.592 --> 01:59:28.728
INDIVIDUAL A YEAR, CAN THIS SORT

01:59:28.794 --> 01:59:30.696
OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT BE BETTER

01:59:30.763 --> 01:59:32.331
SPENT ELSEWHERE? AND CONCLUSION,

01:59:32.398 --> 01:59:33.733
GIVEN THE ABSENCE OF A

01:59:33.799 --> 01:59:35.001
COMPELLING REASON FOR INCREASING

01:59:35.067 --> 01:59:37.336
THESE PENALTIES, THE FACT THAT

01:59:37.403 --> 01:59:38.404
EVIDENCE INDICATES INCREASING

01:59:38.471 --> 01:59:39.906
THESE PENALTIES DOES NOTHING TO

01:59:39.972 --> 01:59:41.207
DETER CRIME AND THE STATE'S

01:59:41.274 --> 01:59:43.309
HISTORY OF PRISON OVERCROWDING.

01:59:43.376 --> 01:59:45.177
WE DO NOT BELIEVE THIS BILL IS

01:59:45.244 --> 01:59:47.413
NECESSARY. FOR THESE REASONS, WE

01:59:47.480 --> 01:59:48.848
RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR NO VOTE

01:59:48.915 --> 01:59:51.651

02:00:49.475 --> 02:00:50.810
WE'RE STILL IN OPPOSITION. THANK

02:00:50.876 --> 02:00:53.346
YOU. ARIANA MONTES, ON BEHALF OF

02:00:53.412 --> 02:00:55.548
THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR

02:00:55.615 --> 02:00:59.385
CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN OPPOSITION.

02:00:59.452 --> 02:01:00.720
WONDERFUL. ANYONE ELSE HOPING TO

02:01:00.786 --> 02:01:03.789
BE HEARD ON THE BILL? OKAY.

02:01:03.856 --> 02:01:05.625
SEEING NONE, I WILL TURN IT BACK

02:01:05.691 --> 02:01:06.325
TO THE DAIS. QUESTIONS OR

02:01:06.392 --> 02:01:07.259
COMMENTS? ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

02:01:07.326 --> 02:01:08.761
LACKEY. YOU CAN BEGIN. YEAH,

02:01:08.828 --> 02:01:11.397
JUST A QUICK COMMENT. I, I FIND

02:01:11.464 --> 02:01:14.033
IT ALARMING, ACTUALLY, THAT

02:01:14.100 --> 02:01:15.234
DISMISSING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR

02:01:15.301 --> 02:01:17.236
SUCH A DECEPTIVE, HURTFUL

02:01:17.303 --> 02:01:19.572
PRACTICE, IT'S BEWILDERING TO

02:01:19.639 --> 02:01:23.876
ME. AND WE HAVE, YOU KNOW, WHEN

02:01:23.943 --> 02:01:27.446
WE TALK ABOUT JUSTICE AND THE

02:01:27.513 --> 02:01:29.148
SCALES OF JUSTICE AND THE

02:01:29.215 --> 02:01:31.617
BALANCE THAT'S THAT'S REQUIRED,

02:01:31.684 --> 02:01:34.720
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

02:01:34.787 --> 02:01:39.025
UNDERSTAND THAT. PENALTY IS PART

02:01:39.091 --> 02:01:42.328
OF JUSTICE. AND THERE ARE MANY

02:01:42.395 --> 02:01:44.030
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO COMPLETELY

02:01:44.096 --> 02:01:47.166
DISMISS THE PUNITIVE NATURE OF

02:01:47.233 --> 02:01:51.570
LAWS. THEY'RE PART OF JUSTICE.

02:01:51.637 --> 02:01:54.440
AND SO TO DISMISS AND TO

02:01:54.507 --> 02:01:57.343
DISCOUNT DECEIVING THE PUBLIC

02:01:57.410 --> 02:01:59.178
DURING A TIME OF CRISIS THAT

02:01:59.245 --> 02:02:01.614
YOU'RE A PUBLIC OFFICIAL. IF

02:02:01.681 --> 02:02:03.049
THAT DOESN'T ALARM YOU, WE'RE IN

02:02:03.115 --> 02:02:05.618
TROUBLE. I CLEARLY SUPPORT THIS

02:02:05.685 --> 02:02:07.787
MEASURE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU,

02:02:07.853 --> 02:02:09.522
MR. LACKEY. OTHER QUESTIONS OR

02:02:09.588 --> 02:02:11.724
COMMENTS FROM THE DAIS? WE HAVE

02:02:11.791 --> 02:02:14.527
A MOTION BY ALANIS, SECOND BY

02:02:14.593 --> 02:02:17.530
NGUYEN. ANY OTHER DISCUSSION?

02:02:17.596 --> 02:02:18.898
SEEING NONE. SENATOR ARCHULETTA,

02:02:18.964 --> 02:02:20.366
WOULD YOU LIKE TO PROVIDE A

02:02:20.433 --> 02:02:22.134
BRIEF CLOSING? YES, I THINK, MR.

02:02:22.201 --> 02:02:23.402
CHAIR. NORMALLY I WOULD JUST

02:02:23.469 --> 02:02:24.904
QUICKLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND

02:02:24.970 --> 02:02:26.605
WALK OUT. BUT I'VE GOT TO SHARE

02:02:26.672 --> 02:02:29.709
WITH YOU THAT I WALKED THE

02:02:29.775 --> 02:02:32.978
STREETS OF ALTADENA, THE

02:02:33.045 --> 02:02:35.081
PALISADES, AS THINGS WERE

02:02:35.147 --> 02:02:37.883
SMOLDERING, AND THE SWAT

02:02:37.950 --> 02:02:39.719
COMMANDER, A FRIEND OF MINE,

02:02:39.785 --> 02:02:41.587
ALLOWED ME TO JUMP IN HIS UNIT,

02:02:41.654 --> 02:02:44.490
AND WE TOURED THE AREA AND I

02:02:44.557 --> 02:02:47.359
LITERALLY SAW FAMILIES CRYING.

02:02:47.426 --> 02:02:49.662
AND IN THE MIDST OF IT ALL,

02:02:49.729 --> 02:02:51.163
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I WITNESSED

02:02:51.230 --> 02:02:53.532
AN INDIVIDUAL WALKING BY WITH A

02:02:53.599 --> 02:02:56.001
YELLOW VEST AND HIGHWAY PATROL

02:02:56.068 --> 02:02:58.137
UNIT PULLED HIM OVER. HE DID NOT

02:02:58.204 --> 02:02:59.905
BELONG IN THE AREA. HE DID NOT

02:02:59.972 --> 02:03:01.807
WORK FOR A UTILITY COMPANY, AND

02:03:01.874 --> 02:03:04.009
HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T WORK FOR A

02:03:04.076 --> 02:03:04.977
CONSTRUCTION COMPANY. AND THEY

02:03:05.044 --> 02:03:07.446
CALLED BACKUP. AND THEY AND THEY

02:03:07.513 --> 02:03:09.749
TOOK THAT INDIVIDUAL AWAY. WHAT

02:03:09.815 --> 02:03:12.284
AUDACITY AT THAT MOMENT TO BE

02:03:12.351 --> 02:03:13.686
THERE. AND THIS IS WHAT WE'RE

02:03:13.753 --> 02:03:15.454
TRYING TO DO, HELP THOSE

02:03:15.521 --> 02:03:16.722
COMMUNITIES THAT NEED HELP. AND

02:03:16.789 --> 02:03:18.424
I THINK THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

02:03:18.491 --> 02:03:20.493
AND EVERY ONE OF US ELECTED GOT

02:03:20.559 --> 02:03:22.628
TO BAND TOGETHER TO PROTECT OUR

02:03:22.695 --> 02:03:25.097
CITIZENS. AND THIS IS A GOOD WAY

02:03:25.164 --> 02:03:25.898
TO START. SO WITH THAT, I DO

02:03:25.965 --> 02:03:28.467
URGE FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK

02:03:28.534 --> 02:03:29.769
YOU VERY MUCH, SENATOR. THANK

02:03:29.835 --> 02:03:30.803
YOU, EVERYONE, FOR YOUR

02:03:30.870 --> 02:03:31.971
TESTIMONY TODAY. COLLEAGUES, THE

02:03:32.037 --> 02:03:33.105
CHAIR IS RECOMMENDING AN AYE.

02:03:33.172 --> 02:03:34.573
AND I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR

02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:36.642
AND ALL OF YOUR COAUTHORS FOR

02:03:36.709 --> 02:03:37.743
WORKING SO CLOSELY WITH OUR

02:03:37.810 --> 02:03:38.811
OFFICE TO STRIKE THE RIGHT

02:03:38.878 --> 02:03:40.212
BALANCE AND LAND THIS PLANE, I

02:03:40.279 --> 02:03:41.847
THINK, IN A PRETTY GOOD SPOT,

02:03:41.914 --> 02:03:42.815
NOTWITHSTANDING ONGOING

02:03:42.882 --> 02:03:44.116
QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS THAT THERE

02:03:44.183 --> 02:03:46.185
MIGHT BE. WITH THAT, WE HAVE A

02:03:46.252 --> 02:03:46.886
MOTION. AND A SECOND. LET'S

02:03:46.952 --> 02:03:50.322
CONDUCT THE ROLL ON SB 571 BY

02:03:50.389 --> 02:03:51.557
SENATOR ARCHULETA. THE MOTION IS

02:03:51.624 --> 02:03:53.292
DUE PASS, AS AMENDED, TO THE

02:03:53.359 --> 02:03:54.360
APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE.

02:03:54.426 --> 02:03:57.530
SCHULTZ. SCHULTZ I L L I

02:03:57.596 --> 02:04:02.668
GONZALEZ. HANEY. LACKEY. LACKEY.

02:04:02.735 --> 02:04:07.006
I NGUYEN. NGUYEN I RAMOS. RAMOS.

02:04:07.072 --> 02:04:10.543
I SHARPE. COLLINS. OKAY, THAT

02:04:10.609 --> 02:04:12.444
MEASURE IS OUT. WE'LL KEEP IT ON

02:04:12.511 --> 02:04:14.280
CALL SO PEOPLE CAN ADD ON. THANK

02:04:14.346 --> 02:04:17.082
YOU, SENATOR ARCHULETA. NEXT I

02:04:17.149 --> 02:04:18.651
SEE IN TERMS OF SIGN IN ORDER,

02:04:18.717 --> 02:04:20.319
WE HAVE SENATOR WIENER AND THEN

02:04:20.386 --> 02:04:21.387
WE HAVE SENATOR SENATOR DURAZZO

02:04:21.453 --> 02:04:22.888
NEXT IN THE HOPPER. SENATOR

02:04:22.955 --> 02:04:24.957
WIENER, WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO

02:04:25.024 --> 02:04:27.159
START WITH ITEM NUMBER 16?

02:04:27.226 --> 02:04:29.562
THAT'S SENATE BILL 627. YES.

02:04:29.628 --> 02:04:31.764
OKAY. PERFECT. THAT WILL BE THE

02:04:31.831 --> 02:04:33.632
ORDER. YOUR TIME BEGINS WHEN

02:04:33.699 --> 02:04:48.981
YOU'RE READY, SIR.

02:04:49.048 --> 02:04:53.252
OKAY, GREAT. THANK YOU FOR

02:04:53.319 --> 02:04:57.289
COMING. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR.

02:04:57.356 --> 02:05:00.993
I'M HERE TODAY. EXCUSE ME. THANK

02:05:01.060 --> 02:05:03.195
YOU, MR. CHAIR. I'M HERE TODAY

02:05:03.262 --> 02:05:05.598
TO PRESENT SENATE BILL 627.

02:05:05.664 --> 02:05:07.032
FIRST, I WANT TO THANK THE

02:05:07.099 --> 02:05:08.367
COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US,

02:05:08.434 --> 02:05:11.637
AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE

02:05:11.704 --> 02:05:13.439
COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. SO THANK

02:05:13.505 --> 02:05:20.446
YOU. SENATE BILL 627 PROHIBITS

02:05:20.512 --> 02:05:24.083
LAW ENFORCEMENT AT ALL LEVELS

02:05:24.149 --> 02:05:27.186
FROM ENGAGING IN EXTREME

02:05:27.253 --> 02:05:32.224
MASKING, WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS.

02:05:32.291 --> 02:05:34.093
THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT

02:05:34.159 --> 02:05:35.494
PREVENTING LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM

02:05:35.561 --> 02:05:39.398
ENGAGING IN THEIR TYPICAL WORK.

02:05:39.465 --> 02:05:42.268
IT IS ABOUT PREVENTING EXTREME

02:05:42.334 --> 02:05:45.437
MASKING THAT IS CAUSING TERROR

02:05:45.504 --> 02:05:48.641
IN OUR COMMUNITIES. JUST TO PUT

02:05:48.707 --> 02:05:51.710
IT REALLY SIMPLY, WHEN SOMEONE

02:05:51.777 --> 02:05:54.613
IS ENGAGING WITH YOU, YOU SHOULD

02:05:54.680 --> 02:05:56.315
BE ABLE TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE

02:05:56.382 --> 02:05:57.950
ABOUT WHETHER THAT PERSON IS A

02:05:58.017 --> 02:05:59.985
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER OR

02:06:00.052 --> 02:06:01.520
WHETHER THEY'RE A GUY WITH A SKI

02:06:01.587 --> 02:06:03.555
MASK ROBBING A LIQUOR STORE. AND

02:06:03.622 --> 02:06:06.425
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE LAW

02:06:06.492 --> 02:06:07.459
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS,

02:06:07.526 --> 02:06:09.662
PARTICULARLY ICE AGENTS, WHO ARE

02:06:09.728 --> 02:06:11.830
RUNNING AROUND EFFECTIVELY WITH

02:06:11.897 --> 02:06:13.232
SKI MASKS ON OR SOMETHING

02:06:13.299 --> 02:06:16.502
APPROACHING A SKI MASK.

02:06:16.568 --> 02:06:18.103
UNIDENTIFIED, GRABBING PEOPLE

02:06:18.170 --> 02:06:19.672
OUT OF BUS STOPS, OUT OF

02:06:19.738 --> 02:06:22.274
PEOPLE'S FRONT YARDS, OUT OF

02:06:22.341 --> 02:06:24.610
WORK SITES AND THROWING THEM

02:06:24.677 --> 02:06:26.478
INTO UNMARKED VEHICLES AND

02:06:26.545 --> 02:06:29.815
TAKING THEM GOD KNOWS WHERE. AND

02:06:29.882 --> 02:06:31.317
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T EVEN

02:06:31.383 --> 02:06:32.651
EFFECTIVELY TRACK PEOPLE IN THE

02:06:32.718 --> 02:06:34.787
SYSTEM ANYMORE, WE DON'T EVEN

02:06:34.853 --> 02:06:38.190
KNOW WHERE PEOPLE ARE, WHETHER

02:06:38.257 --> 02:06:39.892
THEY'RE AT THIS ALLIGATOR

02:06:39.959 --> 02:06:42.127
ALCATRAZ OR AT A GULAG IN EL

02:06:42.194 --> 02:06:44.596
SALVADOR, OR NOW IN LIBYA OR

02:06:44.663 --> 02:06:48.200
SOUTH SUDAN. THE LEVEL OF TERROR

02:06:48.267 --> 02:06:49.902
BEING INFLICTED ON COMMUNITIES

02:06:49.969 --> 02:06:54.239
IN CALIFORNIA IS EXTRAORDINARY,

02:06:54.306 --> 02:06:56.575
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS

02:06:56.642 --> 02:06:59.411
HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO BE

02:06:59.478 --> 02:07:01.280
ACTUALLY BUILDING TRUST WITH

02:07:01.347 --> 02:07:03.215
COMMUNITIES AND NOT RUNNING

02:07:03.282 --> 02:07:06.652
AROUND WITH SKI MASKS ON. AND IT

02:07:06.719 --> 02:07:08.721
IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING FOR SO

02:07:08.787 --> 02:07:10.889
MANY PEOPLE, AND IT IS TEARING

02:07:10.956 --> 02:07:13.726
COMMUNITIES APART. IT IS TEARING

02:07:13.792 --> 02:07:18.697
FAMILIES APART. AND SB 627 WILL

02:07:18.764 --> 02:07:22.134
HELP PUT A STOP TO IT. SB 627

02:07:22.201 --> 02:07:24.169
DOES NOT CATEGORICALLY BAN ALL

02:07:24.236 --> 02:07:26.472
MASKING, STILL ALLOWS FOR

02:07:26.538 --> 02:07:27.639
MASKING OR MASKING TO PROTECT

02:07:27.706 --> 02:07:29.608
YOURSELF AGAINST SMOKE. IT

02:07:29.675 --> 02:07:31.910
DOESN'T DO ANYTHING TO STOP

02:07:31.977 --> 02:07:34.313
OFFICERS FROM USING FACE SHIELDS

02:07:34.380 --> 02:07:36.415
THAT ARE TRANSPARENT, AS YOU

02:07:36.482 --> 02:07:40.052
MIGHT HAVE IN A RIOT SITUATION.

02:07:40.119 --> 02:07:43.622
IT ALLOWS FOR SWAT TEAM MEMBERS

02:07:43.689 --> 02:07:45.391
TO USE MASKING TO PROTECT THEIR

02:07:45.457 --> 02:07:48.761
FACES, AND IT HAS AN EXCEPTION

02:07:48.827 --> 02:07:51.196
FOR UNDERCOVER WORK. BUT THE

02:07:51.263 --> 02:07:52.998
SITUATION THAT WE SEE NOW WITH

02:07:53.065 --> 02:07:55.134
THIS EXTREME FORM OF MASKING,

02:07:55.200 --> 02:07:56.702
GRABBING PEOPLE ON THE STREETS,

02:07:56.769 --> 02:07:58.971
IT IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE.

02:07:59.038 --> 02:08:03.909
AND IT'S TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO

02:08:03.976 --> 02:08:10.282
TAKE ACTION. WE ARE IN AN

02:08:10.349 --> 02:08:12.818
UNPRECEDENTED TIME IN THIS

02:08:12.885 --> 02:08:15.320
COUNTRY AND IN CALIFORNIA. THE

02:08:15.387 --> 02:08:17.923
FACT THAT A FEDERAL COURT FELT

02:08:17.990 --> 02:08:22.161
THE NEED TO ISSUE AN INJUNCTION

02:08:22.227 --> 02:08:25.397
SAYING THAT ICE SHOULD NOT BE

02:08:25.464 --> 02:08:26.832
DETAINING AND ARRESTING PEOPLE

02:08:26.899 --> 02:08:28.667
BECAUSE THEY ARE LATINO OR

02:08:28.734 --> 02:08:30.102
BECAUSE THEY'RE SPEAKING

02:08:30.169 --> 02:08:31.203
SPANISH. I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD

02:08:31.270 --> 02:08:32.571
SEE SUCH A COURT ORDER IN MY

02:08:32.638 --> 02:08:35.074
ENTIRE LIFE. AND YET THAT'S

02:08:35.140 --> 02:08:37.276
WHERE WE ARE, AND THEY'RE

02:08:37.342 --> 02:08:39.812
APPEALING THAT ORDER. SO WE NEED

02:08:39.878 --> 02:08:41.613
TO TAKE STEPS HERE IN THE

02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:43.082
LEGISLATURE TO PROTECT THE

02:08:43.148 --> 02:08:46.919
SAFETY OF CALIFORNIANS. AND THAT

02:08:46.985 --> 02:08:49.154
INCLUDES PUTTING A STOP TO THIS

02:08:49.221 --> 02:08:51.423
EXTREME FORM OF MASKING THAT IS

02:08:51.490 --> 02:08:53.358
DOING NOTHING OTHER THAN

02:08:53.425 --> 02:08:55.160
GENERATE TERROR IN OUR

02:08:55.227 --> 02:08:57.496
COMMUNITIES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK

02:08:57.563 --> 02:08:59.398
FOR AN AYE VOTE, AND WITH ME

02:08:59.465 --> 02:09:00.966
TODAY TO TESTIFY IS CHRISTINE

02:09:01.033 --> 02:09:02.134
SOTO DEBERRY, THE EXECUTIVE

02:09:02.201 --> 02:09:04.002
DIRECTOR OF THE PROSECUTORS

02:09:04.069 --> 02:09:06.872
ALLIANCE, AND LINA ALFARO, A

02:09:06.939 --> 02:09:07.873
VOLUNTEER FOR THE INLAND

02:09:07.940 --> 02:09:09.508
COALITION FOR IMMIGRANT JUSTICE

02:09:09.575 --> 02:09:10.909
AND A LEGAL OBSERVER FOR THE

02:09:10.976 --> 02:09:14.012
RAPID RESPONSE NETWORK FOR THE

02:09:14.079 --> 02:09:17.616
INLAND EMPIRE. GOOD MORNING,

02:09:17.683 --> 02:09:19.551
CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR

02:09:19.618 --> 02:09:20.452
HEARING US HERE TODAY. MY NAME

02:09:20.519 --> 02:09:22.421
IS CHRISTINE SOTO. I'M THE

02:09:22.488 --> 02:09:23.422
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF

02:09:23.489 --> 02:09:24.690
PROSECUTORS ALLIANCE ACTION,

02:09:24.756 --> 02:09:26.625
WHERE I HAVE BEEN AFTER

02:09:26.692 --> 02:09:27.726
COMPLETING A DECADE IN THE SAN

02:09:27.793 --> 02:09:29.528
FRANCISCO DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S

02:09:29.595 --> 02:09:31.230
OFFICE, AND WE'RE PROUD TO BE A

02:09:31.296 --> 02:09:33.165
SPONSOR OF SB 627, A CRITICAL

02:09:33.232 --> 02:09:34.600
PIECE OF LEGISLATION, AS YOU

02:09:34.666 --> 02:09:36.668
JUST HEARD, TO PROTECT BOTH THE

02:09:36.735 --> 02:09:38.070
PUBLIC AND LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:09:38.137 --> 02:09:39.872
ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THE

02:09:39.938 --> 02:09:41.006
IMMIGRATION RAIDS THAT WE'VE

02:09:41.073 --> 02:09:44.610
SEEN ACROSS OUR STATE BY MASKED,

02:09:44.676 --> 02:09:46.745
ANONYMOUS FEDERAL AGENTS HAVE

02:09:46.812 --> 02:09:49.014
SHATTERED PUBLIC TRUST, AND THEY

02:09:49.081 --> 02:09:50.749
ARE MAKING EVERY COMMUNITY LESS

02:09:50.816 --> 02:09:52.885
SAFE. WHEN A FEDERAL AGENT SHOWS

02:09:52.951 --> 02:09:54.686
UP IN OUR COMMUNITIES IN PLAIN

02:09:54.753 --> 02:09:56.255
CLOTHES OR IN A GENERIC VEST

02:09:56.321 --> 02:09:58.657
WITH NO NAME, NO BADGE AND A

02:09:58.724 --> 02:10:00.425
COVERED FACE, THE PUBLIC HAS NO

02:10:00.492 --> 02:10:02.661
WAY TO KNOW IF THEY ARE DEALING

02:10:02.728 --> 02:10:05.164
WITH A FEDERAL, STATE, OR LOCAL

02:10:05.230 --> 02:10:06.932
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER OR EVEN

02:10:06.999 --> 02:10:09.868
AN IMPOSTER. THAT CONFUSION DOES

02:10:09.935 --> 02:10:11.970
NOT JUST ERODE TRUST IN FEDERAL

02:10:12.037 --> 02:10:13.038
OFFICERS. IT UNDERMINES

02:10:13.105 --> 02:10:15.874
CONFIDENCE IN EVERY OFFICER THAT

02:10:15.941 --> 02:10:18.110
SERVES US. WHEN COMMUNITIES

02:10:18.177 --> 02:10:19.278
DON'T TRUST LAW ENFORCEMENT,

02:10:19.344 --> 02:10:21.313
THEY DON'T REPORT CRIME. THEY

02:10:21.380 --> 02:10:23.148
DON'T COOPERATE WITH

02:10:23.215 --> 02:10:24.149
INVESTIGATIONS, AND THEY DON'T

02:10:24.216 --> 02:10:26.718
SEEK HELP. THAT PUTS EVERYONE,

02:10:26.785 --> 02:10:28.487
INCLUDING OFFICERS, AT GREATER

02:10:28.554 --> 02:10:30.322
RISK. CALIFORNIA HAS NOT ONLY

02:10:30.389 --> 02:10:33.525
THE RIGHT, BUT THE OBLIGATION TO

02:10:33.592 --> 02:10:35.727
SET BASELINE PROTECTIONS FOR OUR

02:10:35.794 --> 02:10:37.129
RESIDENTS. THAT MEANS ENSURING

02:10:37.196 --> 02:10:40.332
NO OFFICER, FEDERAL, STATE OR

02:10:40.399 --> 02:10:42.234
LOCAL OPERATES MASKED AND

02:10:42.301 --> 02:10:44.069
ANONYMOUSLY IN OUR COMMUNITIES.

02:10:44.136 --> 02:10:47.272
SB 627 ESTABLISHES CRITICAL

02:10:47.339 --> 02:10:48.674
GUARDRAILS NOW AND FOR THE

02:10:48.740 --> 02:10:50.475
FUTURE, WHILE ALSO CARVING OUT

02:10:50.542 --> 02:10:52.311
APPROPRIATE EXEMPTIONS TO ENSURE

02:10:52.377 --> 02:10:54.046
OFFICERS CAN CONTINUE TO PROTECT

02:10:54.112 --> 02:10:55.981
THEIR FACES WHEN NEEDED FOR

02:10:56.048 --> 02:10:58.083
HEALTH AND SAFETY REASONS. THIS

02:10:58.150 --> 02:11:00.919
BILL IS A PROACTIVE MEASURE MADE

02:11:00.986 --> 02:11:02.287
TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA NEVER

02:11:02.354 --> 02:11:04.156
SLIDES INTO A REALITY WHERE

02:11:04.223 --> 02:11:06.692
SECRET POLICE TACTICS BECOME

02:11:06.758 --> 02:11:07.993
NORMALIZED. IN CALIFORNIA, WE

02:11:08.060 --> 02:11:09.995
DON'T DO SECRET POLICE, WE DON'T

02:11:10.062 --> 02:11:12.397
DO SECRET ARRESTS, AND THIS

02:11:12.464 --> 02:11:13.465
LEGISLATION WILL TAKE THAT

02:11:13.532 --> 02:11:16.335
PRINCIPLE AND CODIFY IT IN LAW.

02:11:16.401 --> 02:11:20.806
WE ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. GOOD

02:11:20.872 --> 02:11:23.642
MORNING, ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. I

02:11:23.709 --> 02:11:25.344
FIRST WANT TO THANK SENATOR

02:11:25.410 --> 02:11:26.945
WIENER AND ALL THE CO-SPONSORS

02:11:27.012 --> 02:11:30.415
OF SB 627 FOR BRAVELY ADDRESSING

02:11:30.482 --> 02:11:32.951
THE FEAR OF OUR COMMUNITIES. MY

02:11:33.018 --> 02:11:36.088
NAME IS LENA ALFARO. I HAVE BEEN

02:11:36.154 --> 02:11:37.990
A RESIDENT OF RIVERSIDE FOR OVER

02:11:38.056 --> 02:11:40.792
30 YEARS. RIVERSIDE IS MY

02:11:40.859 --> 02:11:42.227
COMMUNITY. IT IS WHERE MY

02:11:42.294 --> 02:11:44.062
HUSBAND AND I ARE RAISING OUR

02:11:44.129 --> 02:11:46.298
FIVE YEAR OLD SON, AND IT IS

02:11:46.365 --> 02:11:48.000
WHERE I'VE BEEN A TEACHER FOR

02:11:48.066 --> 02:11:49.868
THE PAST EIGHT YEARS, SINCE THE

02:11:49.935 --> 02:11:51.937
SECOND TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, I

02:11:52.004 --> 02:11:52.971
HAVE SEEN LOVED ONES AND

02:11:53.038 --> 02:11:56.942
NEIGHBORS TERRORIZED BY UNLAWFUL

02:11:57.009 --> 02:12:00.178
AND INHUMANE IMMIGRATION RAIDS.

02:12:00.245 --> 02:12:02.447
I KNEW I HAD TO DO MORE, SO I

02:12:02.514 --> 02:12:03.882
DECIDED TO VOLUNTEER FOR THE

02:12:03.949 --> 02:12:05.617
INLAND COALITION FOR IMMIGRANT

02:12:05.684 --> 02:12:07.786
JUSTICE, WHO MANAGES THE RAPID

02:12:07.853 --> 02:12:09.454
RESPONSE NETWORK IN THE INLAND

02:12:09.521 --> 02:12:11.556
EMPIRE. I AM NOW A LEGAL

02:12:11.623 --> 02:12:13.292
OBSERVER TRAINED TO RESPOND TO

02:12:13.358 --> 02:12:14.226
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT

02:12:14.293 --> 02:12:15.661
SIGHTINGS AND CONNECT COMMUNITY

02:12:15.727 --> 02:12:18.263
MEMBERS TO RESOURCES. ON

02:12:18.330 --> 02:12:20.799
FATHER'S DAY, MY FAMILY AND I

02:12:20.866 --> 02:12:22.968
STOPPED TO FUEL UP AT A GAS

02:12:23.035 --> 02:12:24.236
STATION IN RIVERSIDE. IT WAS

02:12:24.303 --> 02:12:26.505
THERE WHERE I SAW FOUR UNMARKED

02:12:26.571 --> 02:12:28.340
VEHICLES AND FIVE MASKED

02:12:28.407 --> 02:12:31.043
IMMIGRATION AGENTS AGENTS WHO

02:12:31.109 --> 02:12:34.012
HAD TWO SCARED INDIVIDUALS

02:12:34.079 --> 02:12:36.882
HANDCUFFED. I BEGAN RECORDING

02:12:36.948 --> 02:12:38.450
AND INFORMED THE DETAINEES OF

02:12:38.517 --> 02:12:40.519
THEIR RIGHTS, TELLING THEM NOT

02:12:40.585 --> 02:12:42.287
TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND NOT

02:12:42.354 --> 02:12:44.356
TO SIGN ANY DOCUMENTS WITHOUT

02:12:44.423 --> 02:12:46.892
CONSULTING A LAWYER. THE AGENTS

02:12:46.958 --> 02:12:50.562
WERE GATOR AND BALACLAVA MASKS

02:12:50.629 --> 02:12:53.165
WITH HATS AND SUNGLASSES TO

02:12:53.231 --> 02:12:56.034
DISGUISE THEIR IDENTITIES. AS I

02:12:56.101 --> 02:12:58.103
RECORDED, A MASS AGENT TOLD ME

02:12:58.170 --> 02:13:00.672
TO STAND BACK. I MOVED FARTHER

02:13:00.739 --> 02:13:03.575
BACK TO COMPLY, BUT THE OFFICER

02:13:03.642 --> 02:13:04.976
WAS STILL AGGRESSIVE AND HE EVEN

02:13:05.043 --> 02:13:08.213
PUSHED ME. I WAS SCARED FOR WHAT

02:13:08.280 --> 02:13:11.149
THESE MASKED AGENTS MAY DO TO ME

02:13:11.216 --> 02:13:12.918
FOR SIMPLY DOCUMENTING THEIR

02:13:12.984 --> 02:13:15.587
BEHAVIOR. THIS IS JUST ONE

02:13:15.654 --> 02:13:16.822
EXAMPLE OF MANY UNLAWFUL

02:13:16.888 --> 02:13:18.757
OPERATION OPERATIONS HAPPENING

02:13:18.824 --> 02:13:20.058
ACROSS THE STATE, IN WHICH

02:13:20.125 --> 02:13:22.027
MASKED AGENTS DISGUISE THEIR

02:13:22.094 --> 02:13:24.196
IDENTITIES IN ORDER TO ABUSE

02:13:24.262 --> 02:13:25.630
THEIR POWERS AND MISTREAT

02:13:25.697 --> 02:13:28.367
PEOPLE, DISGUISING THEIR

02:13:28.433 --> 02:13:29.701
IDENTITIES MAKES THESE

02:13:29.768 --> 02:13:32.237
OPERATIONS MORE HOSTILE AND LESS

02:13:32.304 --> 02:13:34.539
SAFE FOR EVERYONE, INCLUDING

02:13:34.606 --> 02:13:36.508
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. IT RAISES

02:13:36.575 --> 02:13:38.844
THE QUESTION OF WHO IS A

02:13:38.910 --> 02:13:41.012
LEGITIMATE AGENT OR AN

02:13:41.079 --> 02:13:43.181
IMPERSONATOR. OVERALL, I HEAR

02:13:43.248 --> 02:13:45.016
DIRECTLY FROM OUR COMMUNITY THAT

02:13:45.083 --> 02:13:47.386
THIS HAS LED TO FEAR AND

02:13:47.452 --> 02:13:49.721
MISTRUST OF ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT.

02:13:49.788 --> 02:13:51.456
FOR THOSE REASONS, I HOPE THIS

02:13:51.523 --> 02:13:54.893
COMMITTEE WILL SUPPORT THIS BILL

02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:58.063

HERE, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO SPEAK

02:18:33.405 --> 02:18:34.673
TO THOSE. SO THE BOTTOM LINE IS

02:18:34.739 --> 02:18:36.541
THIS BILL MAKES IT NOW MAKES IT

02:18:36.608 --> 02:18:39.944
A CRIME FOR AN OFFICER TO WEAR A

02:18:40.011 --> 02:18:41.546
MASK. I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR

02:18:41.613 --> 02:18:44.783
ABOUT THAT. WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

02:18:44.849 --> 02:18:48.453
CALIFORNIA IS UNFORTUNATE. WE

02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:49.988
JUST PROTECT THEMSELVES. I WON'T

02:18:50.055 --> 02:18:53.158
SPEAK FOR OTHER GROUPS. HAS PUT

02:18:53.224 --> 02:18:56.528
OUT TO THE PUBLIC THAT A LOT OF

02:18:56.594 --> 02:18:58.963
THE TACTICS ARE OCCURRING. AND

02:18:59.030 --> 02:19:01.533
IN CALIFORNIA BY THE FEDERAL

02:19:01.599 --> 02:19:04.936
GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENTS IS

02:19:05.003 --> 02:19:07.572
INAPPROPRIATE. ALSO, PORAC WAS

02:19:07.639 --> 02:19:08.973
PART OF A LETTER THAT WENT

02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:10.909
DIRECTLY TO THE U.S. ATTORNEY

02:19:10.975 --> 02:19:12.911
GENERAL PREVIOUSLY THAT SAID

02:19:12.977 --> 02:19:16.114
THAT WE DO NOT AND WILL NOT

02:19:16.181 --> 02:19:19.384
ENFORCE IMMIGRATION LAWS, THAT

02:19:19.451 --> 02:19:20.452
THAT'S FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

02:19:20.518 --> 02:19:23.054
THEY'RE NOT IT'S NOT THE JOB OF

02:19:23.121 --> 02:19:24.422
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND THEY

02:19:24.489 --> 02:19:27.325
ARE NOT TRAINED TO DO SO. THE

02:19:27.392 --> 02:19:29.427
THINGS THAT YOU'RE SEEING ON TV,

02:19:29.494 --> 02:19:31.196
THE STORIES HERE TODAY BY THE

02:19:31.262 --> 02:19:34.232
AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS ARE

02:19:34.299 --> 02:19:38.169
TRAGIC, BUT THEY ARE ABOUT

02:19:38.236 --> 02:19:41.272
FEDERAL AGENTS. IF THE AUTHOR

02:19:41.339 --> 02:19:42.674
WANTS TO GO AFTER THE FEDERAL

02:19:42.741 --> 02:19:45.043
AGENTS AND TRY TO DO SOMETHING

02:19:45.110 --> 02:19:47.212
ABOUT WHAT IS OCCURRING HERE IN

02:19:47.278 --> 02:19:48.980
CALIFORNIA, THE BILL SHOULD DO

02:19:49.047 --> 02:19:51.883
THAT. THE PROBLEM IS THE BILL.

02:19:51.950 --> 02:19:53.918
AND IN THE TESTIMONY FROM THE

02:19:53.985 --> 02:19:56.287
AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS, THEY

02:19:56.354 --> 02:19:57.922
TALK ABOUT THESE INCIDENTS,

02:19:57.989 --> 02:20:00.425
THESE INCIDENCES, YET THEY USE

02:20:00.492 --> 02:20:02.260
THE TERM LAW ENFORCEMENT. LAW

02:20:02.327 --> 02:20:03.828
ENFORCEMENT IS DOING THIS. LAW

02:20:03.895 --> 02:20:05.363
ENFORCEMENT DO THAT. CALIFORNIA

02:20:05.430 --> 02:20:07.298
LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE NOT WEARING

02:20:07.365 --> 02:20:09.601
SKI MASKS AND GRABBING PEOPLE

02:20:09.667 --> 02:20:12.070
OUT OF CHURCHES, SYNAGOGUES AND

02:20:12.137 --> 02:20:14.139
THEIR HOMES. THEY'RE NOT DOING

02:20:14.205 --> 02:20:16.641
IT. THE ONLY TIME YOU WILL SEE

02:20:16.708 --> 02:20:18.910
THEM OUT THERE IS IF THEY ARE

02:20:18.977 --> 02:20:20.311
BEING CALLED BY THE FEDERAL

02:20:20.378 --> 02:20:22.480
AGENTS. FOR OFFICERS WHO ARE IN

02:20:22.547 --> 02:20:25.250
TROUBLE OR IN DANGER, THEY HAVE

02:20:25.316 --> 02:20:27.485
TO REPORT TO THAT JUST LIKE ANY

02:20:27.552 --> 02:20:29.721
OTHER PERSON IN THIS ROOM OR IN

02:20:29.788 --> 02:20:33.057
THE STATE MAKES THAT SAME CALL.

02:20:33.124 --> 02:20:34.192
THEY'RE GOING TO THEY'RE GOING

02:20:34.259 --> 02:20:37.595
TO COME OUT. SO I JUST WANT TO

02:20:37.662 --> 02:20:40.899
BE VERY CLEAR. OUR OFFICERS ARE

02:20:40.965 --> 02:20:42.967
PART OF THIS BILL. WE ARE BEING

02:20:43.034 --> 02:20:46.171
SWEPT INTO THIS ISSUE WHEN WE DO

02:20:46.237 --> 02:20:48.273
NOT WANT TO ENFORCE IMMIGRATION.

02:20:48.339 --> 02:20:50.141
AND WE HAVE BEEN PUBLICLY CLEAR

02:20:50.208 --> 02:20:53.144
ABOUT IT. SO WE'RE HOPING THAT

02:20:53.211 --> 02:20:55.547
THIS BILL DOESN'T MOVE. WE'RE

02:20:55.613 --> 02:20:57.382
HOPING THAT WE CAN SIT DOWN AND

02:20:57.448 --> 02:21:00.118
WORK ON PEOPLE WHO ARE IMITATING

02:21:00.185 --> 02:21:03.955
POLICE OFFICERS, PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:21:04.022 --> 02:21:06.758
ILLEGALLY ENFORCING SOME

02:21:06.825 --> 02:21:07.826
IMMIGRATION RULES, PEOPLE WHO

02:21:07.892 --> 02:21:09.494
ARE BEING HIRED AS BOUNTY

02:21:09.561 --> 02:21:13.264
HUNTERS. LET'S GO AFTER THEM, IS

02:21:13.331 --> 02:21:15.033
GOING TO SUPPORT A BILL COMING

02:21:15.099 --> 02:21:17.702
UP TODAY, SB 805, THAT DOES A

02:21:17.769 --> 02:21:19.470
LOT OF THOSE THINGS. WE ARE

02:21:19.537 --> 02:21:22.574
GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL. SO WE

02:21:22.640 --> 02:21:24.776
ARE ASKING THIS BILL NOT MOVE.

02:21:24.843 --> 02:21:26.511
THIS IS THE WRONG WAY, AND IT'S

02:21:26.578 --> 02:21:28.613
GOING AFTER OUR OFFICERS WITH A

02:21:28.680 --> 02:21:30.949
CRIME. INSTEAD OF TALKING TO US

02:21:31.015 --> 02:21:33.585
ABOUT MANDATE THAT ALL AGENCIES

02:21:33.651 --> 02:21:35.286
HAVE TO HAVE POLICIES AND THAT

02:21:35.353 --> 02:21:36.955
THOSE POLICIES HAVE TO BE

02:21:37.021 --> 02:21:38.456
FOLLOWED. IF AN OFFICER DOES

02:21:38.523 --> 02:21:40.191
SOMETHING AND WEARS A MASK

02:21:40.258 --> 02:21:41.693
ILLEGALLY, PER THOSE POLICIES,

02:21:41.759 --> 02:21:43.494
THEY'LL BE DISCIPLINED. AND

02:21:43.561 --> 02:21:44.996
THAT'S THE REALITY. WE'RE

02:21:45.063 --> 02:21:47.065
ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO THIS BILL.

02:21:47.131 --> 02:21:48.933
THANK YOU. YOU HAVE ABOUT A

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:50.168
MINUTE AND 40S REMAINING. I'LL

02:21:50.235 --> 02:21:52.370
BE QUICK. DON'T NEED TO REPEAT A

02:21:52.437 --> 02:21:54.472
LOT OF WHAT MY COLLEAGUE JUST

02:21:54.539 --> 02:21:55.540
ARTICULATED, BUT WE SHARE THE

02:21:55.607 --> 02:21:56.507
SAME SENTIMENT AND DO WANT TO

02:21:56.574 --> 02:21:58.543
TALK TO THE SPECIFIC POLICY IN

02:21:58.610 --> 02:21:59.744
THE BILL. I MEAN, THERE ARE

02:21:59.811 --> 02:22:01.412
EXEMPTIONS IN THE BILL FOR WHEN

02:22:01.479 --> 02:22:03.281
YOU CAN MASK, BUT THEY'RE TOO

02:22:03.348 --> 02:22:03.882
NARROW AND THEY DON'T ACCOUNT

02:22:03.948 --> 02:22:05.750
FOR A LOT OF THINGS THAT AN

02:22:05.817 --> 02:22:07.452
OFFICER WOULD LEGITIMATELY WANT

02:22:07.518 --> 02:22:08.019
TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM

02:22:08.086 --> 02:22:09.354
EXTREME ELEMENTS SANDSTORMS,

02:22:09.420 --> 02:22:10.622
WINDSTORMS. THERE'S A NARROW

02:22:10.688 --> 02:22:12.423
EXEMPTION FOR CERTAIN SMOKE ONLY

02:22:12.490 --> 02:22:13.892
IN DECLARED STATES OF EMERGENCY.

02:22:13.958 --> 02:22:15.426
BUT OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE FIRES

02:22:15.493 --> 02:22:17.996
OUTSIDE OF THOSE TYPES OF

02:22:18.062 --> 02:22:18.997
SITUATIONS. BUT AS AS THE

02:22:19.063 --> 02:22:20.031
REPRESENTATIVE FROM PORK

02:22:20.098 --> 02:22:20.932
MENTIONED SITTING HERE, WE KNOW

02:22:20.999 --> 02:22:22.400
THAT THIS IS NOT ABOUT LOCAL

02:22:22.467 --> 02:22:24.102
STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND IF IT

02:22:24.168 --> 02:22:25.937
IS, THERE'S BETTER WAYS TO

02:22:26.004 --> 02:22:27.238
ADDRESS THAT THAN CREATING

02:22:27.305 --> 02:22:28.706
CRIMES THAT ACTUALLY THREATEN

02:22:28.773 --> 02:22:32.010
OFFICERS WITH JAIL SENTENCES.

02:22:32.076 --> 02:22:33.344
AND I DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE

02:22:33.411 --> 02:22:35.580
FIRST VIOLATION UNDER THE BILL

02:22:35.647 --> 02:22:37.015
WOULD BE AN INFRACTION, BUT THE

02:22:37.081 --> 02:22:38.616
SECOND WOULD BE A MISDEMEANOR.

02:22:38.683 --> 02:22:40.018
AND THAT'S WHOLLY INAPPROPRIATE

02:22:40.084 --> 02:22:43.621
IN OUR MIND. AND EVEN IF, AGAIN,

02:22:43.688 --> 02:22:44.789
IF WE WORK THROUGH ALL THE

02:22:44.856 --> 02:22:45.657
DIFFERENT EXEMPTIONS, THAT WOULD

02:22:45.723 --> 02:22:47.725
HAVE TO BE INCLUDED, YOU KNOW,

02:22:47.792 --> 02:22:50.695
CREATING A CRIME TO PLACE

02:22:50.762 --> 02:22:53.231
OFFICERS IN CUSTODY OVER

02:22:53.298 --> 02:22:54.499
LEGITIMATE REASONS FOR COVERING

02:22:54.565 --> 02:22:55.566
THEIR FACES, NOT WHAT WE'RE

02:22:55.633 --> 02:22:57.735
TALKING ABOUT, NOT THE FEDERAL

02:22:57.802 --> 02:22:58.436
OFFICERS THAT ARE OUT THERE

02:22:58.503 --> 02:23:01.839
CAUSING THE ISSUES WE THINK IS

02:23:01.906 --> 02:23:05.910
UNFITTING AT BEST. AND AS

02:23:05.977 --> 02:23:06.711
COLLEAGUE MENTIONED, WE ARE

02:23:06.778 --> 02:23:08.613
WORKING TO TRY AND ADDRESS SOME

02:23:08.680 --> 02:23:09.514
OF THESE ISSUES. TON OF EMPATHY

02:23:09.580 --> 02:23:11.249
WITH WHAT THE OFFICER AUTHOR

02:23:11.316 --> 02:23:12.350
BROUGHT UP AND THE WITNESSES

02:23:12.417 --> 02:23:14.152
TODAY. WE UNDERSTAND IT IS WHY

02:23:14.218 --> 02:23:15.520
CAL CHIEFS WORKED ON OUR

02:23:15.586 --> 02:23:17.388
ORIGINAL SANCTUARY STATE BILL IN

02:23:17.455 --> 02:23:18.756
2016 TO CREATE THAT BALANCE, TO

02:23:18.823 --> 02:23:20.792
REALLY DEFINE LAW ENFORCEMENT,

02:23:20.858 --> 02:23:22.460
LOCAL STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT'S

02:23:22.527 --> 02:23:24.162
ROLE, AND THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN

02:23:24.228 --> 02:23:25.763
COLLABORATING WITH THE FEDERAL

02:23:25.830 --> 02:23:27.165
GOVERNMENT AND THESE TYPES OF

02:23:27.231 --> 02:23:28.666
SITUATIONS, AND WILL CONTINUE TO

02:23:28.733 --> 02:23:29.600
WORK TO TRY AND ADDRESS SOME OF

02:23:29.667 --> 02:23:31.536
THE CONCERNS AND FEARS FROM THE

02:23:31.602 --> 02:23:32.704
COMMUNITIES. WE ARE PART OF THE

02:23:32.770 --> 02:23:34.605
COMMUNITY, WE FEEL IT TOO. BUT

02:23:34.672 --> 02:23:35.673
UNFORTUNATELY THE POLICY HERE IS

02:23:35.740 --> 02:23:37.675
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN'T AGREE

02:23:37.742 --> 02:23:38.676
WITH. SO RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A

02:23:38.743 --> 02:23:41.112
NO VOTE. GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU

02:23:41.179 --> 02:23:42.613

02:23:42.680 --> 02:23:45.049
GO TOO FAR. THERE MAY BE

02:23:45.116 --> 02:23:46.584
QUESTIONS. LET'S TAKE THE ME

WORKING WITH IMMIGRANTS,

02:25:35.293 --> 02:25:37.395
REFUGEES AND UNDOCUMENTED

02:25:37.462 --> 02:25:39.163
COMMUNITY. AND WHAT'S HAPPENING

02:25:39.230 --> 02:25:42.366
RIGHT NOW IS A TRAGEDY. IT'S

02:25:42.433 --> 02:25:44.202
HEARTBREAKING. IT REALLY IS. AND

02:25:44.268 --> 02:25:47.472
I UNDERSTAND THE BILL AND I

02:25:47.538 --> 02:25:50.007
LISTENED TO BOTH OF YOUR

02:25:50.074 --> 02:25:50.975
TESTIMONIES, AND WHAT I HEARD A

02:25:51.042 --> 02:25:53.845
LOT OF WAS AGENTS, FEDERAL

02:25:53.911 --> 02:25:55.746
AGENTS. AND I SEE THAT NOT ONLY

02:25:55.813 --> 02:25:57.949
DO I SEE IT ON SOCIAL MEDIA, ON

02:25:58.015 --> 02:26:01.119
THE NEWS, BUT ALSO I GET TO HEAR

02:26:01.185 --> 02:26:02.487
EVERY SINGLE DAY, ALMOST ON AN

02:26:02.553 --> 02:26:04.355
HOURLY BASIS, ABOUT THESE

02:26:04.422 --> 02:26:05.823
DEVASTATING STORIES THAT ARE

02:26:05.890 --> 02:26:07.291
HAPPENING RIGHT DOWN THE STREET

02:26:07.358 --> 02:26:08.993
FROM WHERE I LIVE, IN THE

02:26:09.060 --> 02:26:10.761
COMMUNITIES IN WHERE I LIVE IN.

02:26:10.828 --> 02:26:13.030
BUT YOUR TESTIMONY AGAIN TALKED

02:26:13.097 --> 02:26:16.234
ABOUT FEDERAL AGENTS, AND WHAT

02:26:16.300 --> 02:26:19.504
WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS DISPEL A

02:26:19.570 --> 02:26:21.005
LOT OF THE MISINFORMATION THAT'S

02:26:21.072 --> 02:26:22.406
OUT THERE IN OUR COMMUNITY,

02:26:22.473 --> 02:26:24.108
STATING THAT OUR LOCAL LAW

02:26:24.175 --> 02:26:25.610
ENFORCEMENT ARE ENGAGING IN A

02:26:25.676 --> 02:26:27.745
LOT OF THESE RAIDS. I CAN'T TELL

02:26:27.812 --> 02:26:31.048
YOU HOW MANY TIMES I'VE HAD TO

02:26:31.115 --> 02:26:33.151
LET FOLKS KNOW THAT LOCAL LAW

02:26:33.217 --> 02:26:36.487
ENFORCEMENT DOES NOT, DOES NOT

02:26:36.554 --> 02:26:38.856
ENGAGE IN RAIDS. THEY DO NOT GO

02:26:38.923 --> 02:26:40.925
INTO SYNAGOGUES AND CHURCHES AND

02:26:40.992 --> 02:26:42.160
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS

02:26:42.226 --> 02:26:45.830
AND SHELTERS AND ARREST AND FIND

02:26:45.897 --> 02:26:49.000
THOSE THAT ARE UNDOCUMENTED. I

02:26:49.066 --> 02:26:50.902
SPOKE TO MANY OF OUR LOCAL LAW

02:26:50.968 --> 02:26:53.070
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES JUST TO

02:26:53.137 --> 02:26:54.772
CLARIFY THAT, JUST TO MAKE SURE

02:26:54.839 --> 02:26:57.208
THAT I HEAR IT DIRECTLY FROM

02:26:57.275 --> 02:26:59.343
THEM. WHILE I UNDERSTAND THE

02:26:59.410 --> 02:27:01.712
BILL AND WANTING TO BE ABLE TO

02:27:01.779 --> 02:27:04.115
IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS, I GO BACK

02:27:04.182 --> 02:27:05.983
TO, THIS IS MORE AT THE FEDERAL

02:27:06.050 --> 02:27:07.718
LEVEL AND IT'S NOT AT THE LOCAL

02:27:07.785 --> 02:27:09.921
LEVEL. AND WE HAVE TRIED FOR

02:27:09.987 --> 02:27:12.123
MANY YEARS TO BUILD THIS TRUST

02:27:12.190 --> 02:27:14.158
WITH OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.

02:27:14.225 --> 02:27:16.694
WE'VE DONE MANY THINGS LIKE

02:27:16.761 --> 02:27:18.062
COMMUNITY OUTREACH, MAKING SURE

02:27:18.129 --> 02:27:19.931
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IS THERE.

02:27:19.997 --> 02:27:22.033
I FEEL LIKE THIS BILL IS

02:27:22.099 --> 02:27:25.369
ACTUALLY PUSHING THAT ASIDE AND

02:27:25.436 --> 02:27:27.905
MAKING FOLKS THINK THAT OUR

02:27:27.972 --> 02:27:30.441
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENGAGE IN

02:27:30.508 --> 02:27:32.210
SUCH THINGS WHILE WE'RE TRYING

02:27:32.276 --> 02:27:34.345
SO HARD TO ENSURE THAT THEY

02:27:34.412 --> 02:27:35.546
UNDERSTAND THAT, THAT THAT IS

02:27:35.613 --> 02:27:38.849
NOT THE CASE MENTIONED EARLIER

02:27:38.916 --> 02:27:43.020
IS SB 802, WHICH I FEEL LIKE IS

02:27:43.087 --> 02:27:44.922
ONE THAT IS GOING TO DEFINITELY

02:27:44.989 --> 02:27:47.225
IDENTIFY WITH THE NAME Ã BADGE

02:27:47.291 --> 02:27:48.492
WHATNOT. RIGHT. AND THAT'S WHAT

02:27:48.559 --> 02:27:49.927
WE'RE TRYING TO GO AFTER IS

02:27:49.994 --> 02:27:52.063
ENSURING THAT WE GET TO IDENTIFY

02:27:52.129 --> 02:27:54.999
THESE INDIVIDUALS. AND EIGHT 805

02:27:55.066 --> 02:27:56.767
IS THAT WHICH IS ONE THAT I WILL

02:27:56.834 --> 02:27:59.837
BE SUPPORTING. I JUST THINK THIS

02:27:59.904 --> 02:28:02.840
ONE HERE IS REALLY MAKING IT

02:28:02.907 --> 02:28:05.443
DIFFICULT FOR US TO CONTINUE TO

02:28:05.509 --> 02:28:07.878
LET OUR COMMUNITIES KNOW THAT

02:28:07.945 --> 02:28:09.680
OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NOT

02:28:09.747 --> 02:28:11.449
A PART OF THIS. NOW, AS

02:28:11.515 --> 02:28:13.284
MENTIONED, THEY MAY BE CALLED TO

02:28:13.351 --> 02:28:14.919
ASSIST IN A SITUATION WHERE IT

02:28:14.986 --> 02:28:18.623
IS DANGEROUS LIKE IN ANY OTHER

02:28:18.689 --> 02:28:19.991
SITUATIONS. BUT IN THIS

02:28:20.057 --> 02:28:21.859
SITUATION, AS WE ARE ENFORCING

02:28:21.926 --> 02:28:23.594
THIS, IT REALLY MAKES IT SEEM

02:28:23.661 --> 02:28:26.163
LIKE WE ARE PITTING LOCAL LAW

02:28:26.230 --> 02:28:29.800
ENFORCEMENT IN A SITUATION IN

02:28:29.867 --> 02:28:31.135
WHICH THEY ARE NOT THERE, THEY

02:28:31.202 --> 02:28:32.603
ARE NOT THERE. THIS IS AT THE

02:28:32.670 --> 02:28:34.905
FEDERAL LEVEL, AND I BELIEVE

02:28:34.972 --> 02:28:37.441
THIS IS AN AREA IN WHICH WE NEED

02:28:37.508 --> 02:28:40.111
TO ATTACK AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL,

02:28:40.177 --> 02:28:40.978
NOT HERE AT THE STATE LEVEL. AND

02:28:41.045 --> 02:28:42.713
SENATOR, FOR THAT REASON, I WILL

02:28:42.780 --> 02:28:43.814
BE LAYING OFF TODAY. I

02:28:43.881 --> 02:28:44.782
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

02:28:44.849 --> 02:28:46.550
DO, AND I COMMEND YOU FOR WHAT

02:28:46.617 --> 02:28:48.286
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO BECAUSE WE

02:28:48.352 --> 02:28:50.187
WANT TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY

02:28:50.254 --> 02:28:51.689
FOLKS. BUT I BELIEVE THAT 805

02:28:51.756 --> 02:28:53.090
REALLY, TRULY DOES DO SOMETHING

02:28:53.157 --> 02:28:56.827
WHERE NAME AGENCY, FACE

02:28:56.894 --> 02:28:59.363
EVERYTHING. AND I'LL LEAVE IT AT

02:28:59.430 --> 02:29:00.531
THAT, BECAUSE I'M SURE THERE

02:29:00.598 --> 02:29:02.633
WILL BE OTHERS THAT WANT TO

02:29:02.700 --> 02:29:03.668
SPEAK AS WELL TOO. THANK YOU

02:29:03.734 --> 02:29:04.669
VERY MUCH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:29:04.735 --> 02:29:06.037

02:29:16.347 --> 02:29:18.382
JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS MASK

02:29:18.449 --> 02:29:22.119
USAGE? I HAVE CERTAINLY HEARD

02:29:22.186 --> 02:29:25.890
WHAT ICE HAS SAID. WHAT

02:29:25.956 --> 02:29:29.560
SECRETARY NOEM HAS SAID, IN

02:29:29.627 --> 02:29:31.395
ADDITION TO ALL THE OTHER

02:29:31.462 --> 02:29:33.164
INCREDIBLY DESPICABLE AND

02:29:33.230 --> 02:29:34.699
OFFENSIVE THINGS THAT SHE AND

02:29:34.765 --> 02:29:36.834
THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE SAID

02:29:36.901 --> 02:29:39.704
ABOUT IMMIGRANTS, ABOUT BROAD

02:29:39.770 --> 02:29:42.206
BRUSHING, TEN PLUS MILLION

02:29:42.273 --> 02:29:44.709
RESIDENTS OF THIS COUNTRY AS

02:29:44.775 --> 02:29:46.243
CRIMINALS AND THEN RUNNING

02:29:46.310 --> 02:29:49.180
AROUND GRABBING MOTHERS SO THAT

02:29:49.246 --> 02:29:49.880
THEIR KIDS DON'T KNOW WHERE

02:29:49.947 --> 02:29:53.651
THEIR MOMS ARE, SENDING PEOPLE.

02:29:53.718 --> 02:29:55.820

THE OTHER DISGUSTING THINGS THAT

02:29:58.389 --> 02:30:00.591
THEY ARE DOING. SO NO, WE'VE NOT

02:30:00.658 --> 02:30:01.926
SPOKEN TO ICE, BUT I'VE HEARD

02:30:01.992 --> 02:30:04.829
WHAT THEY HAVE SAID AND YOU

02:30:04.895 --> 02:30:07.031
KNOW, IT DOES NOT IN ANY WAY

02:30:07.098 --> 02:30:10.601
EXCUSE SENDING PEOPLE WITH

02:30:10.668 --> 02:30:13.504
EFFECTIVELY SKI MASKS ON INTO

02:30:13.571 --> 02:30:14.705
COMMUNITIES TO GRAB PEOPLE AND

02:30:14.772 --> 02:30:16.774
PUT THEM IN UNMARKED VEHICLES.

02:30:16.841 --> 02:30:18.876
IT DOESN'T EXCUSE IT, BUT I JUST

02:30:18.943 --> 02:30:20.945
WANT TO CONFIRM THE FACT YOU

02:30:21.011 --> 02:30:22.413
HAVE NOT PERSONALLY REACHED OUT.

02:30:22.480 --> 02:30:24.248
THAT IS CORRECT. WE HAVE NOT

02:30:24.315 --> 02:30:25.716

02:31:22.239 --> 02:31:24.909
NOW, WHERE PEOPLE ARE COMING OUT

02:31:24.975 --> 02:31:26.577
IN CARS THAT ARE ENTIRELY

02:31:26.644 --> 02:31:29.780
UNMARKED, YOU KNOW, MINIVANS,

02:31:29.847 --> 02:31:33.150
ENTIRELY UN RECOGNIZABLE AS LAW

02:31:33.217 --> 02:31:36.287
ENFORCEMENT, FULLY MASKED, NO

02:31:36.353 --> 02:31:38.422
BADGE VISIBLE, NO NAME VISIBLE.

02:31:38.489 --> 02:31:40.624
IT GOES AGAINST EVERYTHING WE

02:31:40.691 --> 02:31:42.426
KNOW ABOUT HOW LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:31:42.493 --> 02:31:43.928
SHOULD BE OPERATING IN OUR

02:31:43.994 --> 02:31:47.131
STATE. IT, AS YOU SAID, VIOLATES

02:31:47.198 --> 02:31:51.001
TRUST. IT PUTS NOT ONLY

02:31:51.068 --> 02:31:52.503
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE BEING PULLED

02:31:52.570 --> 02:31:54.939
AWAY IN WAYS THAT MAKE IT LOOK

02:31:55.005 --> 02:31:55.739
LIKE THEY'RE BEING KIDNAPED IN

02:31:55.806 --> 02:31:57.541
DANGER. IT PUTS THOSE OFFICERS

02:31:57.608 --> 02:32:00.110
IN DANGER. IT PUTS OUR LOCAL AND

02:32:00.177 --> 02:32:01.479
STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT IN DANGER.

02:32:01.545 --> 02:32:02.680
HOW ARE THEY? HOW ARE OUR LOCAL

02:32:02.746 --> 02:32:04.782
AND STATE OFFICERS SUPPOSED TO

02:32:04.849 --> 02:32:06.250
KNOW THAT THESE FOLKS ARE

02:32:06.317 --> 02:32:07.218
ACTUALLY FEDERAL LAW

02:32:07.284 --> 02:32:08.719
ENFORCEMENT, THAT IT'S

02:32:08.786 --> 02:32:10.287
INEVITABLE THAT THERE'S GOING TO

02:32:10.354 --> 02:32:13.424
BE PEOPLE WHO GET HURT BECAUSE

02:32:13.491 --> 02:32:14.792
MISTAKES ARE MADE AND

02:32:14.859 --> 02:32:15.860
MISUNDERSTANDING IS BUILT IN BY

02:32:15.926 --> 02:32:17.328
DESIGN. WHEN PEOPLE ARE NOT

02:32:17.394 --> 02:32:19.129
IDENTIFYING THEMSELVES AS LAW

02:32:19.196 --> 02:32:20.564
ENFORCEMENT. NOT TO MENTION, OF

02:32:20.631 --> 02:32:22.233
COURSE, MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE

02:32:22.299 --> 02:32:24.201
ABSOLUTE TERROR THAT IT IS

02:32:24.268 --> 02:32:26.637
BRINGING AROUND OUR COMMUNITIES,

02:32:26.704 --> 02:32:28.606
PEOPLE WHO JUST WANT TO GO TO

02:32:28.672 --> 02:32:29.907
WORK, JUST WANT TO LIVE THEIR

02:32:29.974 --> 02:32:33.077
LIVES AND ARE BEING ATTACKED

02:32:33.143 --> 02:32:35.079
WITH NO UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS

02:32:35.145 --> 02:32:36.547
IS EVEN A LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTION

02:32:36.614 --> 02:32:38.849
OR A FEDERAL IMMIGRATION ACTION.

02:32:38.916 --> 02:32:42.453
SO WHAT I WHAT I WANTED WANTED

02:32:42.520 --> 02:32:45.756
TO ASK YOU AND, AND FIRST OF ALL

02:32:45.823 --> 02:32:47.992
COMMEND YOU FOR TAKING THIS ON

02:32:48.058 --> 02:32:49.360
IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND

02:32:49.426 --> 02:32:51.428
REALLY TERRIFYING REALITY THAT

02:32:51.495 --> 02:32:54.365
WE'RE FACING. YOU KNOW, I THINK

02:32:54.431 --> 02:32:55.900
THAT THIS QUESTION OF HOW WE GET

02:32:55.966 --> 02:32:57.968
AT WHAT IS HAPPENING AND WHAT

02:32:58.035 --> 02:33:00.070
THE ACTUAL CONCERN IS AROUND THE

02:33:00.137 --> 02:33:03.107
FEDERAL IMMIGRATION ACTIONS THAT

02:33:03.173 --> 02:33:05.843
ARE ENTIRELY DESPICABLE AND

02:33:05.910 --> 02:33:07.678
UNACCEPTABLE AND HOW WE SEPARATE

02:33:07.745 --> 02:33:10.915
THAT AND FROM WHAT STATE AND LAW

02:33:10.981 --> 02:33:15.286
ENFORCEMENT ARE DOING, IS THIS

02:33:15.352 --> 02:33:17.821
IN TERMS OF HOW THIS IS WRITTEN

02:33:17.888 --> 02:33:20.691
NOW? ARE THERE CONCERNS ABOUT

02:33:20.758 --> 02:33:23.193
THIS SORT OF BEHAVIOR AND THESE

02:33:23.260 --> 02:33:26.397
TYPES OF THIS TYPE OF ENGAGEMENT

02:33:26.463 --> 02:33:29.266
AROUND MASKING AMONG STATE AND

02:33:29.333 --> 02:33:30.467
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AS WELL?

02:33:30.534 --> 02:33:33.604
ARE THERE EXAMPLES THAT WE ARE

02:33:33.671 --> 02:33:35.839
WE ARE TRYING TO ALSO PREVENT OR

02:33:35.906 --> 02:33:38.375
GAPS IN THE LAW. AND IF YOU

02:33:38.442 --> 02:33:40.044
COULD SPEAK, SPEAK TO THAT AND

02:33:40.110 --> 02:33:42.880
ALSO THE WAYS IN WHICH WE WILL

02:33:42.947 --> 02:33:44.281
EVEN BE ABLE TO APPLY THIS TO,

02:33:44.348 --> 02:33:45.749
TO FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT, WILL

02:33:45.816 --> 02:33:49.687
THIS BE ENFORCEABLE AGAINST WHAT

02:33:49.753 --> 02:33:51.522
WE'RE SEEING, WHICH IS THE, YOU

02:33:51.589 --> 02:33:54.024
KNOW, THE AWFUL EXAMPLES THAT

02:33:54.091 --> 02:33:55.459
WE, YOU KNOW, TRULY NEED TO

02:33:55.526 --> 02:33:57.394
PREVENT IN OUR STATE? YEAH.

02:33:57.461 --> 02:33:59.763
THANK YOU FOR THAT. YOU KNOW, I

02:33:59.830 --> 02:34:00.531
FIRST OF ALL, WANT TO

02:34:00.598 --> 02:34:01.565
ACKNOWLEDGE THIS IS AN

02:34:01.632 --> 02:34:04.134
INCREDIBLY HARD TIME FOR STATE

02:34:04.201 --> 02:34:05.369
AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO

02:34:05.436 --> 02:34:08.105
HAVE TO DEAL WITH A BUNCH OF

02:34:08.172 --> 02:34:10.574
FASCIST THUGS COMING INTO OUR

02:34:10.641 --> 02:34:13.510
COMMUNITIES AND ENGAGING IN THIS

02:34:13.577 --> 02:34:17.014
JUST TRULY VILE BEHAVIOR. IT

02:34:17.081 --> 02:34:19.583
GIVES A BLACK EYE TO ALL OF LAW

02:34:19.650 --> 02:34:21.785
ENFORCEMENT, AND IT CAUSES A

02:34:21.852 --> 02:34:23.587
LACK IT. IT DESTROYS TRUST IN

02:34:23.654 --> 02:34:26.123
LAW ENFORCEMENT. SO I, YOU KNOW,

02:34:26.190 --> 02:34:27.558
FOR OUR STATE, LOCAL LAW

02:34:27.625 --> 02:34:28.726
ENFORCEMENT WHO WORK SO HARD

02:34:28.792 --> 02:34:29.760
EVERY DAY TO BUILD COMMUNITY

02:34:29.827 --> 02:34:32.363
TRUST AND TRY TO DO THE RIGHT

02:34:32.429 --> 02:34:34.331
THING TO HAVE THESE, THESE THUGS

02:34:34.398 --> 02:34:38.736
COME IN AND DO THIS. I CAN ONLY

02:34:38.802 --> 02:34:41.872
IMAGINE HOW DEMORALIZING THAT IS

02:34:41.939 --> 02:34:44.808
FOR OUR OWN OFFICERS WHO WE ALL

02:34:44.875 --> 02:34:47.277
SUPPORT THIS. THIS BILL IS NOT

02:34:47.344 --> 02:34:49.780
ABOUT SAYING WE'RE SOMEHOW

02:34:49.847 --> 02:34:52.049
LUMPING IN STATE AND LOCAL LAW

02:34:52.116 --> 02:34:53.117
ENFORCEMENT AND CLAIMING THAT

02:34:53.183 --> 02:34:54.218
THEY'RE OR INSINUATING THAT

02:34:54.284 --> 02:34:56.654
THEY'RE DOING WHAT ICE IS DOING

02:34:56.720 --> 02:34:59.823
RIGHT NOW. THIS IS ABOUT SETTING

02:34:59.890 --> 02:35:02.192
STANDARDS THAT WE EXPECT OF ANY

02:35:02.259 --> 02:35:04.895
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. ICE WAS

02:35:04.962 --> 02:35:07.164
NOT ICE AGENTS, AS FAR AS I

02:35:07.231 --> 02:35:09.900
KNOW, WERE NOT WEARING SKI MASKS

02:35:09.967 --> 02:35:11.735
UNTIL THEY WERE WEARING SKI

02:35:11.802 --> 02:35:15.039
MASKS. AND SO NOW WE HAVE TO

02:35:15.105 --> 02:35:18.575
DEAL WITH THAT. AND I DON'T WANT

02:35:18.642 --> 02:35:20.544
TO EVEN ENVISION A FUTURE WHERE

02:35:20.611 --> 02:35:23.714
THAT BECOMES SOMEHOW NORMAL,

02:35:23.781 --> 02:35:24.848
NORMALIZED, OR ACCEPTABLE FOR

02:35:24.915 --> 02:35:26.917
LAW ENFORCEMENT TO EVER EVEN

02:35:26.984 --> 02:35:29.386
CONSIDER OPERATING IN THAT WAY.

02:35:29.453 --> 02:35:31.922
AND SO IF WE'RE IF WE'RE SETTING

02:35:31.989 --> 02:35:33.557
STANDARDS, AS I THINK WE SHOULD,

02:35:33.624 --> 02:35:34.458
WHETHER IT'S IN SENATOR PEREZ'S

02:35:34.525 --> 02:35:35.793
BILL, WHICH I FULLY SUPPORT,

02:35:35.859 --> 02:35:37.561
WHICH I'M A JOINT AUTHOR OF, OR

02:35:37.628 --> 02:35:39.897
IN THIS BILL, WE SHOULD SET IT

02:35:39.963 --> 02:35:41.298
FOR ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:35:41.365 --> 02:35:43.100
OFFICERS. WE HAVE PUT EXEMPTIONS

02:35:43.167 --> 02:35:45.202
IN THE BILL. WE HAVE WELCOMED

02:35:45.269 --> 02:35:46.837
ADDITIONAL FEEDBACK. OBVIOUSLY,

02:35:46.904 --> 02:35:48.338
WE'RE ON A SHORTER TIME FRAME.

02:35:48.405 --> 02:35:49.606
WE DID NOT ANTICIPATE HAVING TO

02:35:49.673 --> 02:35:52.543
DO THIS LEGISLATION IN JANUARY.

02:35:52.609 --> 02:35:54.678
I DID NOT ANTICIPATE THE SCALE

02:35:54.745 --> 02:35:56.914
OF WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE

02:35:56.980 --> 02:35:58.749
DOING IN PARTS OF THE STATE, AND

02:35:58.816 --> 02:36:01.318
THE EXTREME DISGUISES THAT

02:36:01.385 --> 02:36:03.120
THEY'RE EFFECTIVELY WEARING. SO

02:36:03.187 --> 02:36:05.122
I DO THINK IT MAKES SENSE FOR

02:36:05.189 --> 02:36:07.891
THE STANDARDS TO APPLY TO

02:36:07.958 --> 02:36:11.528
EVERYONE. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT

02:36:11.595 --> 02:36:13.764
THAT DONALD TRUMP AND HIS

02:36:13.831 --> 02:36:15.899
ADMINISTRATION WANT TO CONSCRIPT

02:36:15.966 --> 02:36:17.634
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DO

02:36:17.701 --> 02:36:18.802
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT WHENEVER

02:36:18.869 --> 02:36:22.005
WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT GOING AFTER

02:36:22.072 --> 02:36:23.407
SANCTUARY JURISDICTIONS OR

02:36:23.474 --> 02:36:25.275
DEFUNDING SANCTUARY

02:36:25.342 --> 02:36:27.344
JURISDICTIONS, THAT IS THAT WHAT

02:36:27.411 --> 02:36:29.580
THEY'RE SAYING IS THEY WANT TO

02:36:29.646 --> 02:36:31.682
BE ABLE TO COERCE CITIES AND

02:36:31.749 --> 02:36:33.484
STATES AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:36:33.550 --> 02:36:35.819
INTO PARTICIPATING IN

02:36:35.886 --> 02:36:36.520
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT, WHICH

02:36:36.587 --> 02:36:39.690
THEY DON'T WANT TO DO. SOME,

02:36:39.757 --> 02:36:41.658
SOME DO, BUT MOST DON'T. BUT

02:36:41.725 --> 02:36:43.260
THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. AND

02:36:43.327 --> 02:36:45.662
SO LET'S GET AHEAD OF THIS AND

02:36:45.729 --> 02:36:47.464
LET'S SET CLEAR RULES IN TERMS

02:36:47.531 --> 02:36:50.467
OF THE FEDERAL ISSUES. AND THIS

02:36:50.534 --> 02:36:52.569
IS IN THIS BILL AND ALSO IN

02:36:52.636 --> 02:36:55.105
SENATOR PEREZ'S BILL THERE. YOU

02:36:55.172 --> 02:36:56.640
KNOW, WE'VE HEARD SOME OF THE

02:36:56.707 --> 02:36:58.075
OPPOSITION TALK ABOUT THE

02:36:58.142 --> 02:36:59.543
FEDERALISM ISSUES. FIRST OF ALL,

02:36:59.610 --> 02:37:01.245
WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO

02:37:01.311 --> 02:37:02.613
PROTECT THE SAFETY OF

02:37:02.679 --> 02:37:04.982
CALIFORNIANS. I WISH CONGRESS

02:37:05.048 --> 02:37:06.483
WOULD DO IT. I KNOW THERE'S A

02:37:06.550 --> 02:37:09.319
SENATE, OUR OWN AMAZING SENATOR,

02:37:09.386 --> 02:37:10.621
ALEX PADILLA, HAS INTRODUCED A

02:37:10.687 --> 02:37:13.157
BILL I YOU KNOW, I HOPE AT SOME

02:37:13.223 --> 02:37:14.625
POINT THAT THAT CAN BECOME LAW.

02:37:14.691 --> 02:37:16.293
I'M NOT GOING TO HOLD MY BREATH

02:37:16.360 --> 02:37:17.961
THAT THAT'S GOING TO ROCKET

02:37:18.028 --> 02:37:18.495
THROUGH THIS PARTICULAR

02:37:18.562 --> 02:37:21.799
CONGRESS. SO WE NEED TO STEP UP

02:37:21.865 --> 02:37:24.401
AND PROTECT CALIFORNIANS. BEING

02:37:24.468 --> 02:37:26.904
A FEDERAL EMPLOYEE DOES NOT

02:37:26.970 --> 02:37:29.640
EXEMPT YOU FROM EVERY STATE LAW,

02:37:29.706 --> 02:37:30.841
AND I KNOW THIS WILL BE AN

02:37:30.908 --> 02:37:32.776
ISSUE, AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE

02:37:32.843 --> 02:37:35.179
THE COURTS TO ADJUDICATE THESE

02:37:35.245 --> 02:37:37.314
ISSUES. BUT I DO THINK THAT WE

02:37:37.381 --> 02:37:39.416
ARE NOT IN A NORMAL TIME. WE'RE

02:37:39.483 --> 02:37:40.884
AT A MOMENT IN TIME WHERE WE

02:37:40.951 --> 02:37:42.719
HAVE THE RISE OF A AUTHORITARIAN

02:37:42.786 --> 02:37:44.521
REGIME THAT'S TRYING TO JUST

02:37:44.588 --> 02:37:46.190
UPEND OUR DEMOCRACY, AND WE NEED

02:37:46.256 --> 02:37:47.524
TO STICK UP FOR CALIFORNIANS.

02:37:47.591 --> 02:37:50.327
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING.

02:37:50.394 --> 02:37:51.428
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

02:37:51.495 --> 02:37:54.097
MEMBER HANEY, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:37:54.164 --> 02:37:55.599
GONZALEZ, THERE'S A LOT. OKAY.

02:37:55.666 --> 02:37:57.634
SO LOOK, I WANT TO THANK THE

02:37:57.701 --> 02:37:58.902
AUTHOR FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND

02:37:58.969 --> 02:38:00.370
FOR PRESENTING. FIRST, I WANT TO

02:38:00.437 --> 02:38:01.305
JUST THANK THE OPPOSITION. I

02:38:01.371 --> 02:38:03.607
KNOW THAT BEING HERE TODAY IS

02:38:03.674 --> 02:38:05.042
NOT EASY. PORAC DID TAKE, HAS

02:38:05.108 --> 02:38:06.376
SENT A LETTER, HAS TAKEN A

02:38:06.443 --> 02:38:09.179
STANCE AND HAS BEEN THERE ON DAY

02:38:09.246 --> 02:38:09.746
ONE TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT

02:38:09.813 --> 02:38:10.781
THEY ARE NOT COORDINATING.

02:38:10.848 --> 02:38:12.583
THEY'RE NOT PART OF THIS AND WE

02:38:12.649 --> 02:38:14.451
HAVE TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT

02:38:14.518 --> 02:38:16.987
AS WELL. THE BILL IS NOT AN

02:38:17.054 --> 02:38:17.521
ATTACK ON LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:38:17.588 --> 02:38:18.422
WHATSOEVER. IT'S A SAFETY NET

02:38:18.488 --> 02:38:19.556
FOR OUR COMMUNITIES WHO ARE

02:38:19.623 --> 02:38:21.124
HURTING THE MOST. THERE ARE

02:38:21.191 --> 02:38:22.426
PEOPLE WHO ARE, AND WE'VE HEARD

02:38:22.492 --> 02:38:25.128
THESE STORIES EVERY SINGLE DAY,

02:38:25.195 --> 02:38:26.763
TAKEN BY A HOSTILE OVERREACH OF

02:38:26.830 --> 02:38:28.198
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGAINST

02:38:28.265 --> 02:38:30.634
OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. I AND

02:38:30.701 --> 02:38:32.369
MY PARTICULAR DISTRICT AND

02:38:32.436 --> 02:38:34.204
SENATOR RAZA, I KNOW IS IN THE

02:38:34.271 --> 02:38:36.106
AUDIENCE AS WELL. ALL OF OUR

02:38:36.173 --> 02:38:37.007
DISTRICT, MACARTHUR PARK, LITTLE

02:38:37.074 --> 02:38:38.408
TOKYO, KOREATOWN, PICO-UNION,

02:38:38.475 --> 02:38:40.043
WESTLAKE, EVERY SINGLE PART OF

02:38:40.110 --> 02:38:41.612
OUR DISTRICT IS TARGETED EVERY

02:38:41.678 --> 02:38:45.649
SINGLE DAY OF EVERY HOUR. AND

02:38:45.716 --> 02:38:47.217
THE ISSUE HERE IN THE

02:38:47.284 --> 02:38:48.819
CONVERSATION HAS BEEN ABOUT

02:38:48.886 --> 02:38:50.120
TRUST. WHEN SOMEBODY AND I'LL

02:38:50.187 --> 02:38:51.421
READ FROM WHAT HAPPENED FROM MY

02:38:51.488 --> 02:38:52.923
TEAM YESTERDAY AT 8:15 A.M.

02:38:52.990 --> 02:38:55.092
TODAY, 714 NEAR GARFIELD AND VIA

02:38:55.158 --> 02:38:56.360
CAMPO AT THE CALAVERAS

02:38:56.426 --> 02:38:57.594
RESTAURANT PARKING LOT, ICE

02:38:57.661 --> 02:38:58.662
AGENTS MASKED SURROUNDED AN

02:38:58.729 --> 02:39:00.330
EMPLOYEE IN THEIR CAR. THEY

02:39:00.397 --> 02:39:01.798
BROKE THE WINDOW AND FORCIBLY

02:39:01.865 --> 02:39:03.600
DETAINED THE INDIVIDUAL. NEARBY

02:39:03.667 --> 02:39:04.835
PRESCHOOL STAFF BEGAN RECORDING

02:39:04.902 --> 02:39:06.069
THE INCIDENT, BUT STOPPED WHEN

02:39:06.136 --> 02:39:07.905
ICE AGENTS, AGGRESSIVELY AND

02:39:07.971 --> 02:39:10.874
MASKED APPROACHED THEM. THAT IS

02:39:10.941 --> 02:39:13.343
NOT NORMAL. AND SO THE ISSUE

02:39:13.410 --> 02:39:14.845
HERE, AGAIN, IS NOT AN ATTACK ON

02:39:14.912 --> 02:39:16.880
LAW ENFORCEMENT. IT'S AN ATTACK

02:39:16.947 --> 02:39:18.448
ON THOSE WHO ARE TAKING

02:39:18.515 --> 02:39:20.484
ADVANTAGE OF BROWN COMMUNITIES.

02:39:20.550 --> 02:39:22.352
AND WE HAVE TO CALL IT WHAT IT

02:39:22.419 --> 02:39:24.221
IS. IT'S RACIST. AND WE'VE BEEN

02:39:24.288 --> 02:39:25.722
THROUGH THIS PATH BEFORE IN THIS

02:39:25.789 --> 02:39:26.957
HOUSE. AND THIS SACRAMENTO HAS

02:39:27.024 --> 02:39:28.659
CREATED LAWS IN PLACE THAT HAVE

02:39:28.725 --> 02:39:29.826
PROTECTED BLACK AND BROWN

02:39:29.893 --> 02:39:30.494
COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE BEEN

02:39:30.560 --> 02:39:32.429
VICTIMS OF BAD COPS. AND WE'VE

02:39:32.496 --> 02:39:33.330
ADDRESSED THOSE ISSUES WHEN WE

02:39:33.397 --> 02:39:34.665
WENT THROUGH GEORGE FLOYD AND

02:39:34.731 --> 02:39:35.699
OTHER ISSUES AS WELL. AND THERE

02:39:35.766 --> 02:39:37.668
ARE BILLS IN THIS, IN THIS THERE

02:39:37.734 --> 02:39:39.770
ARE EXEMPTIONS IN THIS BILL THAT

02:39:39.836 --> 02:39:41.438
THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT THE

02:39:41.505 --> 02:39:42.506
AUTHOR HAS BEEN WORKING ON AS

02:39:42.572 --> 02:39:44.007
WELL. WHEN SOMEONE BREAKS YOUR

02:39:44.074 --> 02:39:45.742
WINDOW AND YANKS YOU OUT OF A

02:39:45.809 --> 02:39:47.544
CHURCH, YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO

02:39:47.611 --> 02:39:48.145
DISTINGUISH, ARE YOU LAPD? ARE

02:39:48.211 --> 02:39:50.614
YOU A SHERIFF OR ARE YOU ICE?

02:39:50.681 --> 02:39:51.515
THEY'RE ATTACKING YOU. THEY'RE

02:39:51.581 --> 02:39:53.250
TAKING AWAY. THEY'RE KIDNAPING

02:39:53.317 --> 02:39:55.118
YOU. AND WHEN FOLKS ARE CALLING

02:39:55.185 --> 02:39:57.020
911, THEY'RE REPORTING A

02:39:57.087 --> 02:39:58.755
KIDNAPING. AND UNFORTUNATELY,

02:39:58.822 --> 02:39:59.790
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS TO

02:39:59.856 --> 02:40:01.892
SHOW UP BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO

02:40:01.959 --> 02:40:02.693
TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY AND THEN

02:40:02.759 --> 02:40:04.428
BECOMES A MISCOMMUNICATION

02:40:04.494 --> 02:40:05.595
BETWEEN ARE THEY COORDINATING

02:40:05.662 --> 02:40:07.297
VERSUS ICE COORDINATING? IF

02:40:07.364 --> 02:40:08.632
THERE'S A SEPARATION BETWEEN

02:40:08.699 --> 02:40:10.100
THOSE WHO ARE NOT WEARING MASKS

02:40:10.167 --> 02:40:11.501
AND THOSE WHO WEAR A MASK,

02:40:11.568 --> 02:40:12.536
THAT'S A DISTINCTION RIGHT THERE

02:40:12.602 --> 02:40:14.237
THAT THAT'S SOMEBODY WHO'S THERE

02:40:14.304 --> 02:40:15.505
TO PROTECT THEM AND TO SERVE,

02:40:15.572 --> 02:40:16.707
AND THAT'S SOMEONE THERE TO

02:40:16.773 --> 02:40:17.908
DETAIN THEM AGAINST THEIR WILL.

02:40:17.975 --> 02:40:19.776
AND SO WHEN YOU KEEP THOSE IN

02:40:19.843 --> 02:40:21.645
MIND AND YOU TALK ABOUT THE

02:40:21.712 --> 02:40:23.280
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FEDERAL AND

02:40:23.347 --> 02:40:24.414
LOCAL, THAT'S NOT WHAT'S ON

02:40:24.481 --> 02:40:26.817
PEOPLE'S MINDS AT THAT MOMENT.

02:40:26.883 --> 02:40:28.986
THEY ARE GETTING ATTACKED EVERY

02:40:29.052 --> 02:40:31.088
SINGLE DAY. AND WE'VE ALSO HEARD

02:40:31.154 --> 02:40:33.590
STORIES ABOUT IMPERSONATIONS,

02:40:33.657 --> 02:40:35.459
PEOPLE COMING INTO THE COMMUNITY

02:40:35.525 --> 02:40:36.526
PRETENDING TO BE LAW

02:40:36.593 --> 02:40:37.260
ENFORCEMENT, AND THESE BOUNTY

02:40:37.327 --> 02:40:39.396
HUNTERS WHO ARE GETTING PAID AND

02:40:39.463 --> 02:40:41.932
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE SYSTEM.

02:40:41.999 --> 02:40:43.734
AND I THINK THAT WE ARE WORKING

02:40:43.800 --> 02:40:45.602
WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO

02:40:45.669 --> 02:40:47.304
DISTINGUISH THOSE. BUT AT IN THE

02:40:47.371 --> 02:40:49.206
DAY, MY CONSTITUENCY SAYS EVERY

02:40:49.272 --> 02:40:51.308
DAY, WELL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING

02:40:51.375 --> 02:40:52.709
FOR US TO PROTECT US? WE'RE

02:40:52.776 --> 02:40:54.077
FARMWORKERS. AND CAMARILLO THAT

02:40:54.144 --> 02:40:56.446
WE SAW JUST LAST WEEK, PEOPLE

02:40:56.513 --> 02:40:57.748
JUST LIVING THEIR EVERY DAY

02:40:57.814 --> 02:40:59.716
LIVES AT A AT A CAR WASH OR A

02:40:59.783 --> 02:41:01.351
GAS STATION, IMMIGRANTS WHO ARE

02:41:01.418 --> 02:41:02.586
CONTRIBUTING TO THE BACKBONE OF

02:41:02.652 --> 02:41:03.954
THIS COUNTRY, WHO MADE IT WHAT

02:41:04.021 --> 02:41:06.390
IT WHAT IT IS TODAY ARE GETTING

02:41:06.456 --> 02:41:09.292
ATTACKED. THIS IS UTILIZING OUR

02:41:09.359 --> 02:41:11.128
COMMUNITIES ON A POLITICAL

02:41:11.194 --> 02:41:12.829
AGENDA THAT IS CREATING THE MOST

02:41:12.896 --> 02:41:16.533
UTMOST PROPAGANDA AT ITS FINEST

02:41:16.600 --> 02:41:18.235
FOR PEOPLE. GIVEN THE FACT THAT

02:41:18.301 --> 02:41:19.636
HIS OWN WIFE IN THIS FEDERAL

02:41:19.703 --> 02:41:20.871
ADMINISTRATION IS AN IMMIGRANT

02:41:20.937 --> 02:41:22.539
HERSELF. BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT

02:41:22.606 --> 02:41:24.041
WHITE IMMIGRANTS, IT'S ABOUT

02:41:24.107 --> 02:41:26.410
BROWN IMMIGRANTS. AND SO, AGAIN,

02:41:26.476 --> 02:41:28.145
AND A LOT OF LOCAL LAW

02:41:28.211 --> 02:41:29.513
ENFORCEMENT ARE LATINO. AND WE

02:41:29.579 --> 02:41:30.680
GOT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND RECOGNIZE

02:41:30.747 --> 02:41:32.015
THAT. AND THEY'RE GOOD UNION

02:41:32.082 --> 02:41:33.417
MEMBERS, AND THEY'RE NOT THE

02:41:33.483 --> 02:41:34.618
ONES WHO ARE ATTACKING. THEY'RE

02:41:34.684 --> 02:41:36.486
NOT THE ONES WHO ARE DOING THIS.

02:41:36.553 --> 02:41:38.188
THEY ARE TAKING ORDERS FROM A

02:41:38.255 --> 02:41:39.856
DICTATOR MASKED UP AND HIDING

02:41:39.923 --> 02:41:43.226
THEIR IDENTITY AND KIDNAPING

02:41:43.293 --> 02:41:44.928
PEOPLE AGAINST THEIR WILL FOR

02:41:44.995 --> 02:41:47.497
JUST SIMPLY GOING TO WORK, GOING

02:41:47.564 --> 02:41:49.299
TO A GRADUATION, GOING TO

02:41:49.366 --> 02:41:51.201
CHURCH, GOING TO A DIALYSIS

02:41:51.268 --> 02:41:53.170
APPOINTMENT EVERY SINGLE DAY. SO

02:41:53.236 --> 02:41:56.106
SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE. AND

02:41:56.173 --> 02:41:58.575
OUR COMMUNITY HAVING TO FIGURE

02:41:58.642 --> 02:42:00.444
OUT WHAT DO WE DO? HOW DO WE

02:42:00.510 --> 02:42:02.179
PROTECT OURSELVES? HOW DO WE

02:42:02.245 --> 02:42:03.213
SAFEGUARD OURSELVES AGAINST

02:42:03.280 --> 02:42:05.749
THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE TAKING

02:42:05.816 --> 02:42:08.018
ADVANTAGE OF THIS MOMENT FOR

02:42:08.085 --> 02:42:10.487
THEIR OWN REASON, BUT NOT

02:42:10.554 --> 02:42:12.122
DISTINGUISHING THEMSELVES IS

02:42:12.189 --> 02:42:14.891
KEY. AND SO LOOK, FOR ME, NO ONE

02:42:14.958 --> 02:42:16.059
ENFORCING THE LAW SHOULD GET TO

02:42:16.126 --> 02:42:17.561
HIDE FROM THE PEOPLE THAT THEY

02:42:17.627 --> 02:42:20.497
SERVE. THIS BILL IS ABOUT

02:42:20.564 --> 02:42:22.432
TRANSPARENCY. THIS BILL IS ABOUT

02:42:22.499 --> 02:42:23.800
ACCOUNTABILITY, AND THIS BILL IS

02:42:23.867 --> 02:42:26.436
ABOUT RESTORING TRUST BECAUSE

02:42:26.503 --> 02:42:27.838
OUR COMMUNITY DESERVES TO SEE

02:42:27.904 --> 02:42:29.473
THE FACES OF THOSE WHO ARE

02:42:29.539 --> 02:42:33.143
WIELDING POWER IN THEIR NAME.

02:42:33.210 --> 02:42:35.045
AND THIS BILL, THIS BILL SETS

02:42:35.112 --> 02:42:37.214
THE TONE THAT NO ONE IS ABOVE

02:42:37.280 --> 02:42:40.450
THE LAW. AND WITH THAT, I AM IN

02:42:40.517 --> 02:42:42.519
FULL SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. AND I

02:42:42.586 --> 02:42:43.520
WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR, AND I

02:42:43.587 --> 02:42:45.522
WANT TO THANK THOSE HERE TODAY.

02:42:45.589 --> 02:42:47.257
AND I WANT TO REEMPHASIZE THE

02:42:47.324 --> 02:42:48.959
FACT THAT IT'S NOT AGAINST YOU

02:42:49.025 --> 02:42:50.327
GUYS, IT'S AGAINST THE FEDERAL

02:42:50.393 --> 02:42:51.161
ADMINISTRATION WHO IS GUIDING

02:42:51.228 --> 02:42:54.030
THEMSELVES AS YOU AND TAKING

02:42:54.097 --> 02:42:57.033
ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION AND

02:42:57.100 --> 02:43:00.170
STEALING OUR PEOPLE AS A

02:43:00.237 --> 02:43:01.671
POLITICAL AGENDA. AND SO THIS IS

02:43:01.738 --> 02:43:03.640
A SAFEGUARD AND A SAFETY NET IN

02:43:03.707 --> 02:43:07.010
PLACE THAT REVEAL YOURSELVES,

02:43:07.077 --> 02:43:09.212
SHOW WHO YOU ARE, BECAUSE WE'VE

02:43:09.279 --> 02:43:10.981
GOT TO DO SOMETHING HERE IN

02:43:11.047 --> 02:43:13.383
CALIFORNIA TO PROTECT OUR

02:43:13.450 --> 02:43:14.551
CONSTITUENCY. AND IMMIGRANTS

02:43:14.618 --> 02:43:16.219
MADE US THE FOURTH LARGEST

02:43:16.286 --> 02:43:18.622
ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. AND THIS

02:43:18.688 --> 02:43:19.990
IS THIS FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION'S

02:43:20.056 --> 02:43:22.893
WAY OF TRYING TO KNEECAP US AND

02:43:22.959 --> 02:43:24.361
GET RID OF THE PROGRESS THAT WE

02:43:24.427 --> 02:43:26.530
HAVE MADE. AND SO THANK YOU, MR.

02:43:26.596 --> 02:43:27.964
WIENER, FOR BEING THAT BEACON OF

02:43:28.031 --> 02:43:29.733
HOPE, FOR BEING THAT GOLDEN

02:43:29.799 --> 02:43:31.368
STATE, FOR BEING THAT CALIFORNIA

02:43:31.434 --> 02:43:34.171
THAT WE KNOW. AND I AM FULLY IN

02:43:34.237 --> 02:43:36.239
SUPPORT. AND I ASK THAT I MOVE

02:43:36.306 --> 02:43:37.541
THIS BILL TODAY. THANK YOU,

02:43:37.607 --> 02:43:38.642
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ. I'LL

02:43:38.708 --> 02:43:40.544
TAKE THAT AS A MOTION. WE'LL ASK

02:43:40.610 --> 02:43:42.012
FOR A SECOND AT THE APPROPRIATE

02:43:42.078 --> 02:43:43.079
TIME. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS

02:43:43.146 --> 02:43:44.881
WELL, THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR, AND

02:43:44.948 --> 02:43:46.983
THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR

02:43:47.050 --> 02:43:49.052
BRINGING THIS THIS SITUATION

02:43:49.119 --> 02:43:52.656
FORWARD. HOWEVER, ICE AGENTS AND

02:43:52.722 --> 02:43:54.624
WHAT THE ACTIONS THAT THEY ARE

02:43:54.691 --> 02:43:56.293
DOING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

02:43:56.359 --> 02:43:58.795
ARE DEPLORING, AND IT'S NOT

02:43:58.862 --> 02:44:01.731
HUMANIZED FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE TO

02:44:01.798 --> 02:44:03.700
BE YANKED OUT OF CARS. HOWEVER,

02:44:03.767 --> 02:44:05.368
IT'S THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO

02:44:05.435 --> 02:44:08.238
YOUR BILL TO MOVE FORWARD TO GET

02:44:08.305 --> 02:44:10.040
FACE COVERINGS OFF OF FEDERAL

02:44:10.106 --> 02:44:12.876
OFFICERS, WOULD THE STATE HAVE

02:44:12.943 --> 02:44:13.743
ANY INPUT AND MAKING SURE THAT

02:44:13.810 --> 02:44:16.780
THAT TRULY DOES HAPPEN? ARE YOU

02:44:16.846 --> 02:44:18.315
TALKING ABOUT ENFORCEMENT

02:44:18.381 --> 02:44:20.550
FEDERAL OFFICERS? YEAH, IT WOULD

02:44:20.617 --> 02:44:22.953
BE A VIOLATION OF STATE LAW. AND

02:44:23.019 --> 02:44:24.454
LISTEN, I'M NOT GOING TO SIT

02:44:24.521 --> 02:44:26.489
HERE AND SAY THAT. IT'S NOT THAT

02:44:26.556 --> 02:44:28.258
IT'S GOING TO BE SUPER EASY, BUT

02:44:28.325 --> 02:44:30.560
IT WILL BE A VIOLATION OF STATE

02:44:30.627 --> 02:44:32.229
LAW, JUST LIKE THERE ARE OTHER

02:44:32.295 --> 02:44:33.463
VIOLATIONS OF STATE LAW THAT

02:44:33.530 --> 02:44:35.332
FEDERAL AGENTS CAN COMMIT AND BE

02:44:35.398 --> 02:44:37.734
HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR. BUT

02:44:37.801 --> 02:44:39.803
FEDERAL LAW YOU MENTIONED

02:44:39.869 --> 02:44:41.438
SENATOR PADILLA IS MOVING A BILL

02:44:41.504 --> 02:44:42.572
AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL HE'S

02:44:42.639 --> 02:44:44.274
INTRODUCED. SO THAT WOULD BE THE

02:44:44.341 --> 02:44:46.810
RIGHT PLACE TO HAVE, SAY, OVER

02:44:46.876 --> 02:44:49.246
FEDERAL OFFICERS. HE'S GETTING

02:44:49.312 --> 02:44:51.815
TO THE THAT PART OF IT. SO, YES,

02:44:51.881 --> 02:44:53.583
SENATOR PADILLA INTRODUCED A

02:44:53.650 --> 02:44:55.418
BILL. SO DID SEVERAL MEMBERS OF

02:44:55.485 --> 02:44:58.054
THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

02:44:58.121 --> 02:45:01.458
AND I AM ROOTING FOR THEM TO BE

02:45:01.524 --> 02:45:02.826
ABLE TO PASS THOSE BILLS. I'M

02:45:02.892 --> 02:45:05.495
ALSO NOT HOLDING MY BREATH IN

02:45:05.562 --> 02:45:06.596
THIS CONGRESS THAT THOSE BILLS

02:45:06.663 --> 02:45:09.399
ARE GOING TO ADVANCE. I HOPE

02:45:09.466 --> 02:45:10.934
THEY DO, AND I HOPE I'M WRONG.

02:45:11.001 --> 02:45:14.504
AND SO BUT REGARDLESS, WE HAVE A

02:45:14.571 --> 02:45:16.573
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT

02:45:16.640 --> 02:45:18.408
RESIDENTS OF THIS STATE, AND

02:45:18.475 --> 02:45:20.677
SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO DO THAT.

02:45:20.744 --> 02:45:22.512
AND BUT I THINK THAT THIS BILL,

02:45:22.579 --> 02:45:25.582
IN ADDITION TO SB 805 BY SENATOR

02:45:25.649 --> 02:45:28.518
PEREZ, WHICH ALSO APPLIES TO

02:45:28.585 --> 02:45:31.821
FEDERAL OFFICERS IN ADDITION TO

02:45:31.888 --> 02:45:33.890
STATE AND LOCAL OFFICERS, I'M

02:45:33.957 --> 02:45:36.393
GLAD THAT YOU'RE SUPPORTING

02:45:36.459 --> 02:45:37.827
THEM. THAT'S ALSO, QUOTE

02:45:37.894 --> 02:45:39.663
UNQUOTE, LUMPING EVERYONE

02:45:39.729 --> 02:45:40.930
TOGETHER. BUT IT'S NOT LUMPING

02:45:40.997 --> 02:45:42.832
PEOPLE TOGETHER. IT IS SETTING

02:45:42.899 --> 02:45:44.668
STANDARDS FOR ALL OFFICERS,

02:45:44.734 --> 02:45:46.036
WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE.

02:45:46.102 --> 02:45:47.337
I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR

02:45:47.404 --> 02:45:49.105
THAT CLARIFICATION THAT FEDERAL

02:45:49.172 --> 02:45:50.874
LAW PERTAINS TO FEDERAL

02:45:50.940 --> 02:45:52.275
OFFICERS. NOW, ON THE STATE

02:45:52.342 --> 02:45:54.144
SIDE, WHEN SITUATIONS DO HAPPEN

02:45:54.210 --> 02:45:55.612
AND WE HAVE TO CALL 911, IT'S

02:45:55.679 --> 02:45:57.280
OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:45:57.347 --> 02:45:58.648
OFFICERS THAT ARE RESPONDING,

02:45:58.715 --> 02:46:00.216
AND THAT'S OUR LOCAL LAW

02:46:00.283 --> 02:46:01.251
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS THAT WOULD

02:46:01.318 --> 02:46:03.053
BE INVESTIGATING, KIDNAPING ALL

02:46:03.119 --> 02:46:04.487
THESE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ARE

02:46:04.554 --> 02:46:06.356
GOING ON. AND A LOT OF TRUST

02:46:06.423 --> 02:46:08.058
THAT HAS BEEN WORKED TO BRING

02:46:08.124 --> 02:46:09.326
THE COMMUNITIES TOGETHER FOR OUR

02:46:09.392 --> 02:46:11.328
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IS

02:46:11.394 --> 02:46:13.863
SOMETHING THAT WE THINK THIS

02:46:13.930 --> 02:46:16.066
BILL NOW PAINTS EVERYBODY IN THE

02:46:16.132 --> 02:46:18.635
SAME PICTURE. WHEN WE DO AGREE

02:46:18.702 --> 02:46:21.137
THAT FEDERAL OFFICERS AND FACE

02:46:21.204 --> 02:46:22.572
MASKS AND COVERINGS AND TRYING

02:46:22.639 --> 02:46:24.007
TO FIGURE OUT IF THEY'RE TRULY

02:46:24.074 --> 02:46:25.308
FEDERAL OFFICERS OR NOT, WE'RE

02:46:25.375 --> 02:46:27.043
GOING TO BE CALLING OUR LOCAL

02:46:27.110 --> 02:46:28.812
LAW ENFORCEMENT, OUR LOCAL

02:46:28.878 --> 02:46:29.446
SHERIFFS TO INVESTIGATE THOSE,

02:46:29.512 --> 02:46:31.147
TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE, IN

02:46:31.214 --> 02:46:32.749
FACT, LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.

02:46:32.816 --> 02:46:35.285
SO IN THAT SITUATION, OUR LOCAL

02:46:35.352 --> 02:46:37.887
LAW ENFORCEMENTS DO HAVE A ROLE

02:46:37.954 --> 02:46:40.090
IN PROTECTING OUR PEOPLE. AND SO

02:46:40.156 --> 02:46:42.926
THIS BILL AND JUST LIKE THE

02:46:42.992 --> 02:46:45.195
ADMINISTRATION NOW IS BLANKETING

02:46:45.261 --> 02:46:46.963
EVERYBODY AND GOING AFTER PEOPLE

02:46:47.030 --> 02:46:49.032
IN DIFFERENT HOME DEPOTS AND

02:46:49.099 --> 02:46:50.934
THESE THINGS, STEREOTYPING

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.169
PEOPLE IN A SENSE, WE'RE DOING

02:46:53.236 --> 02:46:55.305
THE SAME THING TO OUR LOCAL LAW

02:46:55.372 --> 02:46:56.673
ENFORCEMENT. WHEN THE LOCAL LAW

02:46:56.740 --> 02:46:57.807
ENFORCEMENT ARE GOING TO BE THE

02:46:57.874 --> 02:46:59.809
ONES THAT WE'RE CALLING TO

02:46:59.876 --> 02:47:00.910
PROTECT US, TO ENSURE THAT

02:47:00.977 --> 02:47:02.779
PEOPLE THAT ARE BEING TAKEN ARE

02:47:02.846 --> 02:47:05.582
BEING INVESTIGATED. AND SO I

02:47:05.648 --> 02:47:08.118
THINK THE FEDERAL ASPECT DON'T

02:47:08.184 --> 02:47:09.185
TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU. THERE

02:47:09.252 --> 02:47:11.187
SHOULD BE SOME COMPONENTS ON

02:47:11.254 --> 02:47:12.489
THAT. BUT WHEN WE TAKE THE

02:47:12.555 --> 02:47:14.491
PAINTBRUSH, WE BRING PAINTBRUSH.

02:47:14.557 --> 02:47:16.493
ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE STATE

02:47:16.559 --> 02:47:17.260
OF CALIFORNIA, OUR COUNTY

02:47:17.327 --> 02:47:18.228
SHERIFFS, OUR LOCAL LAW

02:47:18.294 --> 02:47:19.796
ENFORCEMENT, HIGHWAY PATROL, ALL

02:47:19.863 --> 02:47:21.598
OF THOSE WHEN THEY'RE ACTUALLY

02:47:21.664 --> 02:47:23.266
CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE FROM THE

02:47:23.333 --> 02:47:24.834
FEDERAL OFFICERS COMING IN,

02:47:24.901 --> 02:47:25.902
DOING WHAT THEY'RE DOING. AND

02:47:25.969 --> 02:47:27.303
THEN THEY HAVE TO BE CALLED

02:47:27.370 --> 02:47:28.371
BECAUSE SOME THINGS HAPPEN, AND

02:47:28.438 --> 02:47:30.407
NOW THEY'RE OUT THERE TRYING TO

02:47:30.473 --> 02:47:31.908
CONTROL AND BRING PEACE TO THE

02:47:31.975 --> 02:47:33.843
SITUATION. I THINK THERE'S MERIT

02:47:33.910 --> 02:47:35.578
IN BRINGING FORWARD ARGUMENTS

02:47:35.645 --> 02:47:37.347
AGAINST THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

02:47:37.414 --> 02:47:38.882
I'M NOT SO SURE THAT THERE'S

02:47:38.948 --> 02:47:40.083
MERIT AGAINST OUR LOCAL LAW

02:47:40.150 --> 02:47:41.584
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. AND THAT'S

02:47:41.651 --> 02:47:44.487
WHERE I'M HAVING SOME SOME

02:47:44.554 --> 02:47:47.090
DISAGREEMENT ON. AND I VERY MUCH

02:47:47.157 --> 02:47:48.892
RESPECT THAT. AND I AND I

02:47:48.958 --> 02:47:51.728
APPRECIATE IT. I, I GUESS MY, MY

02:47:51.795 --> 02:47:56.833
TAKE ON IT IS I, I IS SHOWING US

02:47:56.900 --> 02:47:59.302
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE BASICALLY

02:47:59.369 --> 02:48:01.070
SECRET POLICE WHERE YOU'RE LIKE

02:48:01.137 --> 02:48:03.306
WEARING ESSENTIALLY A SKI MASK

02:48:03.373 --> 02:48:04.741
OR SOMETHING, APPROACHING A SKI

02:48:04.808 --> 02:48:06.342
MASK AND HOW COMPLETELY

02:48:06.409 --> 02:48:08.845
TERRIFYING THAT IS. I LIKE THIS

02:48:08.912 --> 02:48:11.948
IS NOT ABOUT LUMPING IN OR

02:48:12.015 --> 02:48:13.349
DEMONIZING STATE AND LOCAL LAW

02:48:13.416 --> 02:48:15.552
ENFORCEMENT. THEY'RE BEING PUT

02:48:15.618 --> 02:48:17.387
IN A TERRIBLE POSITION. BUT THIS

02:48:17.454 --> 02:48:19.122
IS ABOUT SAYING WE'VE NOW SEEN

02:48:19.189 --> 02:48:20.957
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE LAW

02:48:21.024 --> 02:48:22.559
ENFORCEMENT DO THAT. WE DON'T

02:48:22.625 --> 02:48:24.594
WANT ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DO

02:48:24.661 --> 02:48:26.429
THAT. AND SO IF WE'RE GOING TO

02:48:26.496 --> 02:48:29.566
SET A STANDARD, LET'S MAKE IT A

02:48:29.632 --> 02:48:30.733
STANDARD FOR ALL LAW

02:48:30.800 --> 02:48:32.635
ENFORCEMENT. I YOU KNOW, I CAN'T

02:48:32.702 --> 02:48:34.637
EVEN IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD BE. I

02:48:34.704 --> 02:48:35.472
WORK VERY CLOSELY AS

02:48:35.538 --> 02:48:36.339
ASSEMBLYMEMBER HANEY WITH THE

02:48:36.406 --> 02:48:37.407
SAN FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT,

02:48:37.474 --> 02:48:38.908
AND I SUPPORT THAT DEPARTMENT. A

02:48:38.975 --> 02:48:41.044
LOT OF HARD WORKING OFFICERS WHO

02:48:41.110 --> 02:48:45.014
DO GREAT WORK. AND THE IDEA AND

02:48:45.081 --> 02:48:48.218
THAT IF ONE WERE TO SHOW UP AND

02:48:48.284 --> 02:48:50.153
YOU SAW A LOCAL POLICE OFFICER

02:48:50.220 --> 02:48:51.554
WEARING A SKI MASK, WE WOULD ALL

02:48:51.621 --> 02:48:52.622
BE HORRIFIED. THEY'RE NOT DOING

02:48:52.689 --> 02:48:54.390
THAT. AND I DON'T WANT THEM EVER

02:48:54.457 --> 02:48:56.326
TO EVEN THINK ABOUT DOING THAT.

02:48:56.392 --> 02:48:58.194
AND WE SHOULD SET THOSE CLEAR

02:48:58.261 --> 02:48:59.429
STANDARDS NOW, AND THEY SHOULD

02:48:59.496 --> 02:49:01.064
APPLY TO EVERYONE, PARTICULARLY

02:49:01.130 --> 02:49:03.066
IN A SITUATION WHERE DONALD

02:49:03.132 --> 02:49:04.868
TRUMP HAS SAID THAT HE WANTS TO

02:49:04.934 --> 02:49:06.603
FORCE STATE AND LOCAL LAW

02:49:06.669 --> 02:49:08.471
ENFORCEMENT TO BECOME ARMS OF

02:49:08.538 --> 02:49:10.573
ICE, THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS. WE'RE

02:49:10.640 --> 02:49:12.141
FIGHTING HIM ON THAT. WHEN HE

02:49:12.208 --> 02:49:13.443
SAYS HE WANTS TO DEFUND

02:49:13.510 --> 02:49:14.944
SANCTUARY CITIES, SANCTUARY

02:49:15.011 --> 02:49:16.279
CITIES, THAT'S WHAT HE'S TALKING

02:49:16.346 --> 02:49:17.747
ABOUT. FORCING LOCAL LAW

02:49:17.814 --> 02:49:18.915
ENFORCEMENT TO BECOME

02:49:18.982 --> 02:49:20.283
IMMIGRATION AGENTS, WHICH THEY

02:49:20.350 --> 02:49:22.151
DON'T WANT TO DO. AND WE DON'T

02:49:22.218 --> 02:49:24.320
WANT THEM TO DO THAT. BUT THAT'S

02:49:24.387 --> 02:49:24.921
WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO FORCE

02:49:24.988 --> 02:49:27.891
THEM TO DO. SENATOR, COULD I

02:49:27.957 --> 02:49:28.925
APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM

02:49:28.992 --> 02:49:30.727
SEVERAL OF THE MEMBERS CONCERNED

02:49:30.793 --> 02:49:32.195
ABOUT OUR STATE AND LOCAL LAW

02:49:32.262 --> 02:49:33.596
ENFORCEMENT. AND I THINK WHAT

02:49:33.663 --> 02:49:34.697
WE'RE SEEING AROUND THE STATE

02:49:34.764 --> 02:49:36.132
AND AROUND THE COUNTRY IS

02:49:36.199 --> 02:49:37.534
BECAUSE OF THE ACTIONS OF ICE.

02:49:37.600 --> 02:49:40.169
ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT IS LOSING

02:49:40.236 --> 02:49:41.538
LEGITIMACY AND TRUST BECAUSE

02:49:41.604 --> 02:49:42.739
INDIVIDUALS IN OUR COMMUNITY

02:49:42.805 --> 02:49:44.107
CANNOT TELL WHO THEY'RE

02:49:44.173 --> 02:49:45.875
INTERACTING WITH. ONE OF THE

02:49:45.942 --> 02:49:47.310
GREAT BENEFITS OF THIS BILL IS

02:49:47.377 --> 02:49:49.445
IT WILL MAKE IT VERY CLEAR TO

02:49:49.512 --> 02:49:50.580
EVERYBODY THAT MASKS ARE NOT

02:49:50.647 --> 02:49:52.749
ALLOWED IN OUR STATE. WHAT WE

02:49:52.815 --> 02:49:53.716
WILL BE DOING IS CODIFYING WHAT

02:49:53.783 --> 02:49:55.585
WE ALREADY DO IN OUR STATE. OUR

02:49:55.652 --> 02:49:56.686
STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:49:56.753 --> 02:49:58.454
DO NOT WEAR MASKS. WE'RE HAPPY

02:49:58.521 --> 02:49:59.689
ABOUT THAT. WE WILL MAKE THAT

02:49:59.756 --> 02:50:01.724
NOW THE OFFICIAL RULE OF OUR

02:50:01.791 --> 02:50:03.560
STATE. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE

02:50:03.626 --> 02:50:04.928
DO THAT, AND THAT WE APPLY THAT

02:50:04.994 --> 02:50:06.396
TO ALL OFFICERS SO THAT WE HAVE

02:50:06.462 --> 02:50:08.798
A SHOT AT AT REINING IN THE

02:50:08.865 --> 02:50:10.733
ACTIVITY THAT WE'RE SEEING FROM

02:50:10.800 --> 02:50:12.101
FEDERAL OFFICERS RIGHT NOW. AND

02:50:12.168 --> 02:50:13.703
YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBERS SO WISELY

02:50:13.770 --> 02:50:15.004
POINT OUT THE CHALLENGE THAT

02:50:15.071 --> 02:50:16.139
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE IN.

02:50:16.205 --> 02:50:18.708
THE LA POLICE CHIEF HAS NOW

02:50:18.775 --> 02:50:20.777
INSTRUCTED IN A POLICY FOR HIS

02:50:20.843 --> 02:50:21.911
DEPARTMENT THAT HIS OFFICERS

02:50:21.978 --> 02:50:24.414
HAVE TO MAKE INQUIRIES OF MASKED

02:50:24.480 --> 02:50:26.182
AGENTS. THEY ARE IN AN

02:50:26.249 --> 02:50:26.983
IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION OF HAVING

02:50:27.050 --> 02:50:28.818
TO QUESTION ANOTHER OFFICER OUT

02:50:28.885 --> 02:50:31.254
IN THE FIELD IN QUITE DANGEROUS

02:50:31.321 --> 02:50:33.156
CIRCUMSTANCES, SOMETIMES BECAUSE

02:50:33.222 --> 02:50:34.290
CROWDS OF PEOPLE ARE GATHERING

02:50:34.357 --> 02:50:35.925
AND DON'T KNOW WHO IS GRABBING

02:50:35.992 --> 02:50:37.493
PEOPLE OUT OF THE CAR WASH OR

02:50:37.560 --> 02:50:39.596
THE PARK. IT IS CREATING CHAOS

02:50:39.662 --> 02:50:40.964
IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT IS

02:50:41.030 --> 02:50:42.298
PUTTING LAW ENFORCEMENT IN VERY

02:50:42.365 --> 02:50:43.833
REAL DANGER. OUR LOCAL LAW

02:50:43.900 --> 02:50:45.668
ENFORCEMENT IN VERY REAL DANGER.

02:50:45.735 --> 02:50:47.637
AND THE HOPE OF THIS LEGISLATION

02:50:47.704 --> 02:50:49.906
IS THAT WE WILL HAVE A CLEAR LAW

02:50:49.973 --> 02:50:51.407
IN OUR STATE THAT WE DO NOT

02:50:51.474 --> 02:50:52.976
MASK. THAT IS CURRENTLY THE

02:50:53.042 --> 02:50:54.444
POLICY OF MOST OF THE AGENCIES

02:50:54.510 --> 02:50:57.080
IN THE STATE. WHAT WE ARE ASKING

02:50:57.146 --> 02:50:57.880
FOR IN THE LEGISLATION IS THAT

02:50:57.947 --> 02:50:59.682
EACH AGENCY HAVE THAT POLICY

02:50:59.749 --> 02:51:01.117
THAT THEIR OFFICERS WILL NOT

02:51:01.184 --> 02:51:02.518
MASK, AND EVERY AGENCY THAT HAS

02:51:02.585 --> 02:51:04.320
THOSE POLICIES, THERE IS NO

02:51:04.387 --> 02:51:05.588
CRIMINAL LIABILITY FOR THEIR

02:51:05.655 --> 02:51:07.523
EMPLOYEES BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND

02:51:07.590 --> 02:51:08.658
THAT THEY ARE DOING A LAW

02:51:08.725 --> 02:51:09.859
ENFORCEMENT JOB. THERE ARE

02:51:09.926 --> 02:51:10.660
SCENARIOS WHERE THEY NEED TO

02:51:10.727 --> 02:51:12.929
WEAR FACE PROTECTIONS OF VARYING

02:51:12.996 --> 02:51:14.364
DEGREES, AND THOSE WILL BE

02:51:14.430 --> 02:51:16.032
ACCOUNTED FOR IN THEIR LOCAL

02:51:16.099 --> 02:51:17.734
POLICIES. BUT IF WE DO NOT HAVE

02:51:17.800 --> 02:51:19.869
A BROAD BILL THAT COVERS ALL OF

02:51:19.936 --> 02:51:22.305
LAW ENFORCEMENT, WE ARE CREATING

02:51:22.372 --> 02:51:23.439
SUSCEPTIBILITY IN OUR APPROACH,

02:51:23.506 --> 02:51:24.907
AND IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE

02:51:24.974 --> 02:51:27.010
HAVE A UNIFORM APPROACH TO THIS

02:51:27.076 --> 02:51:28.811
ISSUE. I THINK WE ALL AGREE WITH

02:51:28.878 --> 02:51:30.213
THAT. I THINK THE SUPPORT THAT

02:51:30.279 --> 02:51:31.714
IS HERE IS BECAUSE WE DON'T

02:51:31.781 --> 02:51:33.650
EXPERIENCE THAT IN OUR STATE, ON

02:51:33.716 --> 02:51:35.151
THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. THANK

02:51:35.218 --> 02:51:35.752
GOODNESS. AND THANK GOODNESS

02:51:35.818 --> 02:51:37.553
THAT WE NEVER WILL IF WE'RE ABLE

02:51:37.620 --> 02:51:39.389
TO PASS THIS. WE DON'T EVEN COME

02:51:39.455 --> 02:51:40.390
NEAR THAT QUESTION, AND

02:51:40.456 --> 02:51:42.058
HOPEFULLY WE HAVE A SHOT AT

02:51:42.125 --> 02:51:42.792
CREATING SOME BUFFERS AROUND

02:51:42.859 --> 02:51:43.593
WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS

02:51:43.660 --> 02:51:45.461
DOING RIGHT NOW, AND WE CAN HELP

02:51:45.528 --> 02:51:47.697
OUR COMMUNITIES REMEMBER THAT

02:51:47.764 --> 02:51:49.432
LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THIS STATE IS

02:51:49.499 --> 02:51:52.835
THERE TO SERVE AND PROTECT THEM.

02:51:52.902 --> 02:51:54.470
IMMIGRANT, NONIMMIGRANT,

02:51:54.537 --> 02:51:57.907
EVERYONE ALIKE. THANK YOU VERY

02:51:57.974 --> 02:52:00.476
MUCH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS,

02:52:00.543 --> 02:52:02.078
VICE CHAIR ALANIS, THE FLOOR IS

02:52:02.145 --> 02:52:04.480
YOURS. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. I

02:52:04.547 --> 02:52:06.382
WAS GOING TO GO INTO SOMETHING,

02:52:06.449 --> 02:52:08.851
BUT DO YOU GUYS WANT TO ADDRESS

02:52:08.918 --> 02:52:10.219
WHAT WAS JUST SAID? AS FAR AS

02:52:10.286 --> 02:52:12.422
THE. YEAH, LOOK, ALL I WOULD

02:52:12.488 --> 02:52:15.258
LIKE TO SAY IS THAT WE ARE BEING

02:52:15.324 --> 02:52:17.894
LUMPED IN IN THE SENSE THAT

02:52:17.960 --> 02:52:19.962
THEY'RE MAKING THIS A CRIME.

02:52:20.029 --> 02:52:22.165
WHEN WE DEALT WITH OTHER VERY

02:52:22.231 --> 02:52:24.000
SERIOUS ISSUES LIKE USE OF FORCE

02:52:24.067 --> 02:52:25.735
BY OFFICERS BECAUSE OF INCIDENTS

02:52:25.802 --> 02:52:28.604
THAT OCCURRED BACK EAST, ALL THE

02:52:28.671 --> 02:52:30.707
THINGS THAT SURROUNDED THAT

02:52:30.773 --> 02:52:32.275
DE-ESCALATION OF FORCE, ALL OF

02:52:32.341 --> 02:52:33.710
THAT, ALL OF THAT, IN THE END,

02:52:33.776 --> 02:52:36.913
WAS CREATED BY MANDATING

02:52:36.979 --> 02:52:39.382
STATEWIDE STANDARDS ON POLICY

02:52:39.449 --> 02:52:41.684
THAT ALL AGENCIES SHALL HAVE

02:52:41.751 --> 02:52:43.786
THESE POLICIES IN PLACE OR

02:52:43.853 --> 02:52:45.822
GREATER TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE.

02:52:45.888 --> 02:52:48.157
SO IN THE FUTURE, THEY WON'T BE

02:52:48.224 --> 02:52:49.525
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WON'T WEAR

02:52:49.592 --> 02:52:51.327
A MASK BECAUSE THEY CAN'T. IT

02:52:51.394 --> 02:52:52.628
WILL BE WRONG TO DO THAT. IT'LL

02:52:52.695 --> 02:52:54.263
BE ILLEGAL, IT'LL BE AGAINST

02:52:54.330 --> 02:52:55.465
POLICY, AND THOSE OFFICERS WILL

02:52:55.531 --> 02:52:57.800
BE FIRED AND LIKELY BE LOSE

02:52:57.867 --> 02:52:59.368
THEIR LICENSE TO BE A PEACE

02:52:59.435 --> 02:53:00.670
OFFICER IN CALIFORNIA UNDER SB

02:53:00.737 --> 02:53:02.672
TWO. THAT'S HOW WE DEALT WITH

02:53:02.739 --> 02:53:03.973
OTHER SERIOUS ISSUES. LIKE WE'RE

02:53:04.040 --> 02:53:05.675
IN AN UNPRECEDENTED AREA. I GET

02:53:05.742 --> 02:53:08.845
THIS, BUT TO PUT US IN WITH

02:53:08.911 --> 02:53:10.046
EVERYTHING THAT'S BEING

02:53:10.113 --> 02:53:11.881
DESCRIBED FROM THE FEDERAL

02:53:11.948 --> 02:53:13.382
AGENTS IS NOT THE WAY TO DO IT.

02:53:13.449 --> 02:53:16.452
BY MAKING IT A CRIME AGAINST AN

02:53:16.519 --> 02:53:19.355
OFFICER, IT MANDATE IN THIS BILL

02:53:19.422 --> 02:53:21.591
THAT IT APPLIES TO ALL FEDERAL

02:53:21.657 --> 02:53:22.725
AGENTS AND GO AFTER THEM, AND

02:53:22.792 --> 02:53:24.460
THEN ON ANYTHING RELATED TO

02:53:24.527 --> 02:53:25.895
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT MANDATE,

02:53:25.962 --> 02:53:28.297
MINIMUM STANDARDS. THIS ISN'T

02:53:28.364 --> 02:53:30.199
SAYING THIS ISN'T A STANDARD.

02:53:30.266 --> 02:53:33.436
THIS IS A NEW CRIME MANDATE

02:53:33.503 --> 02:53:34.871
STANDARDS. WE WILL WORK AND

02:53:34.937 --> 02:53:36.272
MANDATE STANDARDS AND MAKE THEM

02:53:36.339 --> 02:53:38.074
HIGH AND MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T

02:53:38.141 --> 02:53:39.909
EVER GO DOWN THIS ROAD AND WE

02:53:39.976 --> 02:53:42.178
WILL FULLY ENGAGE ON THAT AND

02:53:42.245 --> 02:53:44.013
SUPPORT IT. SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

02:53:44.080 --> 02:53:47.884
TALKING ABOUT. THANK YOU FOR

02:53:47.950 --> 02:53:50.419
RESPONDING TO THAT. SO FOR THE

02:53:50.486 --> 02:53:52.188
FOR CHRISTINE, REAL QUICK, I

02:53:52.255 --> 02:53:53.623
KNOW YOU'RE A PROUD SPONSOR AND

02:53:53.689 --> 02:53:54.690
YOU TALKED ABOUT THIS IS GOING

02:53:54.757 --> 02:53:56.025
TO PROTECT LAW ENFORCEMENT. CAN

02:53:56.092 --> 02:53:57.393
YOU ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT MORE

02:53:57.460 --> 02:53:59.729
ON HOW IT'S GOING TO PROTECT LAW

02:53:59.796 --> 02:54:00.463
ENFORCEMENT. YES. THANK YOU.

02:54:00.530 --> 02:54:02.532
MEMBER I THINK LOS ANGELES IS A

02:54:02.598 --> 02:54:04.367
GREAT EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW WHERE

02:54:04.433 --> 02:54:05.535
OFFICERS ARE LOCAL LAW

02:54:05.601 --> 02:54:07.970
ENFORCEMENT ARE BEING CALLED OUT

02:54:08.037 --> 02:54:12.008
FOR REPORTED KIDNAPINGS FOR

02:54:12.074 --> 02:54:13.276
CHAOTIC SITUATIONS IN THE

02:54:13.342 --> 02:54:14.577
COMMUNITY. WHEN THERE'S A VAN

02:54:14.644 --> 02:54:16.412
THAT PULLS UP WITHOUT A LICENSE

02:54:16.479 --> 02:54:17.413
PLATE, WITHOUT ANY MARKING ON

02:54:17.480 --> 02:54:20.616
THE VAN AND FULLY DISGUISED, WE

02:54:20.683 --> 02:54:21.784
BELIEVE OUR FEDERAL OFFICERS,

02:54:21.851 --> 02:54:23.820
BUT EVERYONE IN THE MOMENT HAS

02:54:23.886 --> 02:54:25.655
LITTLE CERTAINTY. THAT IS

02:54:25.721 --> 02:54:27.056
CREATING A VERY CHALLENGING

02:54:27.123 --> 02:54:28.191
SITUATION FOR LOCAL LAW

02:54:28.257 --> 02:54:29.592
ENFORCEMENT. THEY ARE CALLED OUT

02:54:29.659 --> 02:54:31.427
TO RESPOND TO A KIDNAPING AND

02:54:31.494 --> 02:54:33.462
THEN ENCOUNTER WHAT THEY ARE

02:54:33.529 --> 02:54:34.931
UNSURE IF THEY ARE FEDERAL

02:54:34.997 --> 02:54:37.233
OFFICERS, IF THEY ARE IMPOSTERS.

02:54:37.300 --> 02:54:38.701
AND AS I INDICATED, LOS ANGELES

02:54:38.768 --> 02:54:40.770
POLICE CHIEF NOW HAS ASKED ALL

02:54:40.837 --> 02:54:43.372
OF HIS SWORN OFFICERS TO

02:54:43.439 --> 02:54:45.575
INQUIRE. AND I KNOW MANY OF YOU

02:54:45.641 --> 02:54:47.510
HAVE BEEN IN LAW ENFORCEMENT.

02:54:47.577 --> 02:54:48.678
YOU CAN IMAGINE THE JUST THE

02:54:48.744 --> 02:54:49.779
UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATION OF

02:54:49.846 --> 02:54:51.714
SHOWING UP TO A SCENE WHERE YOU

02:54:51.781 --> 02:54:53.749
THINK, MAYBE I'M ENCOUNTERING A

02:54:53.816 --> 02:54:54.383
COLLEAGUE, MAYBE I'M NOT, AND I

02:54:54.450 --> 02:54:56.185
NOW HAVE TO ENGAGE IN AN

02:54:56.252 --> 02:54:58.387
IDENTIFICATION PROCESS OF A

02:54:58.454 --> 02:54:59.856
FEDERAL AGENT IN THE MIDDLE OF

02:54:59.922 --> 02:55:01.257
AN ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY. IT IS

02:55:01.324 --> 02:55:02.992
AN INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS

02:55:03.059 --> 02:55:04.861
SITUATION. WE'VE NOT YET SEEN A

02:55:04.927 --> 02:55:08.097
SITUATION WITH WEAPONS IN THE

02:55:08.164 --> 02:55:09.899
HANDS OF ANYBODY, BUT YOU COULD

02:55:09.966 --> 02:55:11.100
IMAGINE SO MANY SCENARIOS WHERE

02:55:11.167 --> 02:55:12.501
IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO

02:55:12.568 --> 02:55:13.936
INQUIRE IN THE MOMENT WHO YOU'RE

02:55:14.003 --> 02:55:17.106
INTERACTING WITH, AND A REALLY

02:55:17.173 --> 02:55:18.241
PRECARIOUS LIFE AND DEATH

02:55:18.307 --> 02:55:19.242
SITUATION, FRANKLY, FOR THOSE

02:55:19.308 --> 02:55:20.476
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS FROM

02:55:20.543 --> 02:55:21.878
OUR COMMUNITY THAT ARE ASKED TO

02:55:21.944 --> 02:55:23.279
RESPOND. SO THE HOPE IS WITH

02:55:23.346 --> 02:55:25.381
THIS BILL, WE WILL MAKE IT CLEAR

02:55:25.448 --> 02:55:27.683
THAT NOBODY CAN WEAR A MASK, AND

02:55:27.750 --> 02:55:28.551
THEN IT WILL BE VERY CLEAR WHEN

02:55:28.618 --> 02:55:30.186
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IS CALLED

02:55:30.253 --> 02:55:31.520
TO RESPOND TO A CHAOTIC

02:55:31.587 --> 02:55:32.955
SITUATION AT A CAR WASH OR IN

02:55:33.022 --> 02:55:34.257
MACARTHUR PARK, THEY WILL KNOW

02:55:34.323 --> 02:55:34.790
THAT THEY'RE ENCOUNTERING

02:55:34.857 --> 02:55:37.026
FEDERAL OFFICERS AND THEY WILL

02:55:37.093 --> 02:55:38.094
UNDERSTAND THEIR OWN PROTOCOLS,

02:55:38.160 --> 02:55:40.663
HOW TO ENGAGE WITH THEM VERSUS

02:55:40.730 --> 02:55:43.232
SOMEBODY THAT'S IMPERSONATING.

02:55:43.299 --> 02:55:45.134
THANK YOU. LET ME REMIND

02:55:45.201 --> 02:55:46.435
EVERYBODY THAT IT WASN'T TOO

02:55:46.502 --> 02:55:47.536
LONG AGO THAT WE WERE REQUIRED

02:55:47.603 --> 02:55:49.438
TO WEAR A MASK IN LAW

02:55:49.505 --> 02:55:50.907
ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE OF COVID, SO

02:55:50.973 --> 02:55:52.742
THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS

02:55:52.808 --> 02:55:53.509
NOT COME UP. AND THAT WAS

02:55:53.576 --> 02:55:54.644
SOMETHING THAT WAS PUSHED ON LAW

02:55:54.710 --> 02:55:55.845
ENFORCEMENT, INCLUDING MYSELF.

02:55:55.912 --> 02:55:57.680
I'M I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF THIS

02:55:57.747 --> 02:55:59.882
BILL, SENATOR. I'M SORRY. I KNOW

02:55:59.949 --> 02:56:01.050
MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO

02:56:01.117 --> 02:56:03.286
MADE A LOT OF GOOD POINTS AS FAR

02:56:03.352 --> 02:56:05.421
AS WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO TRUST

02:56:05.488 --> 02:56:06.088
LAW ENFORCEMENT. LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:56:06.155 --> 02:56:07.657
HAS DONE A GREAT JOB IN BUILDING

02:56:07.723 --> 02:56:09.258
COMMUNITY TRUST AND WEARING

02:56:09.325 --> 02:56:10.726
THEIR BADGES, THEIR

02:56:10.793 --> 02:56:11.694
IDENTIFICATIONS, AS AS HE

02:56:11.761 --> 02:56:13.829
MENTIONED, AS IS IN OUR COMMON

02:56:13.896 --> 02:56:18.167
PRACTICES THAT GO ON RIGHT NOW.

02:56:18.234 --> 02:56:19.468
IT IS ALSO OUR RESPONSIBILITY,

02:56:19.535 --> 02:56:21.470
AS WAS BROUGHT UP, TO MAKE SURE

02:56:21.537 --> 02:56:22.605
THAT WE PROTECT CALIFORNIANS.

02:56:22.672 --> 02:56:23.539
HOWEVER, WE DO NOT HAVE THE

02:56:23.606 --> 02:56:24.740
AUTHORITY OVER THE FEDERAL

02:56:24.807 --> 02:56:25.708
GOVERNMENT, WHICH IS WHO THIS

02:56:25.775 --> 02:56:28.411
BILL IS REALLY GOING AFTER. I

02:56:28.477 --> 02:56:30.179
WAS GOING TO BRING UP AN

02:56:30.246 --> 02:56:31.614
INCIDENT AS FAR AS WHEN I USED

02:56:31.681 --> 02:56:34.050
TO BE ON SWAT, AND WE WERE GOING

02:56:34.116 --> 02:56:35.151
AFTER THE CARTELS, WE HAD TO

02:56:35.217 --> 02:56:36.018
STRIP EVERYTHING THAT IDENTIFIED

02:56:36.085 --> 02:56:38.487
US TO PROTECT MY FAMILY, TO

02:56:38.554 --> 02:56:40.523
PROTECT MYSELF, MY DEPARTMENT.

02:56:40.589 --> 02:56:41.691
AND I SEE THERE'S SOME

02:56:41.757 --> 02:56:42.725
EXEMPTIONS LIKE THAT FOR SWAT,

02:56:42.792 --> 02:56:44.894
BUT I SEE THE EXEMPTION IS

02:56:44.961 --> 02:56:47.063
ACTUALLY FOR COVERING AND THEIR

02:56:47.129 --> 02:56:48.564
FACE TO PROTECT THEM FROM ANY

02:56:48.631 --> 02:56:50.299
KIND OF THINGS THAT GO ON IN

02:56:50.366 --> 02:56:52.101
THERE. IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING

02:56:52.168 --> 02:56:52.768
ABOUT PROTECTING THEIR FAMILIES.

02:56:52.835 --> 02:56:54.971
IT'S JUST THEIR FACE ON THERE. I

02:56:55.037 --> 02:56:57.039
ALSO USED TO RUN ONE OF OUR

02:56:57.106 --> 02:56:59.075
MOBILE FIELD FORCE TEAMS THAT GO

02:56:59.141 --> 02:57:01.077
IN FOR RIOTS. THEY WERE GAS

02:57:01.143 --> 02:57:03.546
MASKS. SO ARE THEY NOT ALLOWED

02:57:03.612 --> 02:57:05.815
TO WEAR THEIR GAS MASKS BECAUSE

02:57:05.881 --> 02:57:06.449
THAT COVERS THEM? I SEE IT HAS

02:57:06.515 --> 02:57:07.950
TO BE A TRANSPARENT SHIELD AND

02:57:08.017 --> 02:57:09.752
THEY MAY WEAR THOSE ALSO, BUT

02:57:09.819 --> 02:57:11.887
WHEN GAS IS USED, I EXPECT THEM

02:57:11.954 --> 02:57:13.823
TO BE WEARING THEIR GAS MASKS.

02:57:13.889 --> 02:57:14.757
SO THAT COULD BE AN ISSUE IN

02:57:14.824 --> 02:57:17.393
ITSELF. I KNOW THIS DOESN'T FEEL

02:57:17.460 --> 02:57:18.928
LIKE WE'RE ATTACKING LAW

02:57:18.995 --> 02:57:19.929
ENFORCEMENT, BUT UNINTENTIONALLY

02:57:19.996 --> 02:57:22.231
IT IS ATTACKING LAW ENFORCEMENT.

02:57:22.298 --> 02:57:25.601
I UNDERSTAND THAT THE ROOT OF

02:57:25.668 --> 02:57:27.303
THIS BILL IS TO GO AFTER ICE FOR

02:57:27.370 --> 02:57:28.704
ALL THE RAIDS AND EVERYTHING

02:57:28.771 --> 02:57:30.206
THAT ARE GOING ON, AND BELIEVE

02:57:30.272 --> 02:57:32.308
ME, I'M GETTING PHONE CALLS FROM

02:57:32.375 --> 02:57:33.409
CHIEFS, FROM SHERIFFS, AND FROM

02:57:33.476 --> 02:57:34.477
OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS

02:57:34.543 --> 02:57:36.645
WHO ARE NOT HAPPY WITH THAT, BUT

02:57:36.712 --> 02:57:38.347
THEY CARE ABOUT THEIR COMMUNITY

02:57:38.414 --> 02:57:40.383
AND WHEN THEY ARE WEARING MASKS,

02:57:40.449 --> 02:57:41.484
WHEN I'VE BEEN ON SEARCH

02:57:41.550 --> 02:57:43.486
WARRANTS AND SUCH, AND I KNOW

02:57:43.552 --> 02:57:44.920
IT'S COVERED HERE FOR UNDERCOVER

02:57:44.987 --> 02:57:46.389
WORK, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE

02:57:46.455 --> 02:57:47.423
PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF THE

02:57:47.490 --> 02:57:49.625
CASE THAT'S GOING ON. WE WANT TO

02:57:49.692 --> 02:57:50.559
MAKE SURE THAT WE PROTECT THE

02:57:50.626 --> 02:57:51.927
IDENTITY OF THAT UNDERCOVER,

02:57:51.994 --> 02:57:54.196
UNDERCOVER OFFICER THAT'S

02:57:54.263 --> 02:57:56.032
WORKING. AND SO THINGS. AND SO

02:57:56.098 --> 02:57:57.433
THERE'S ALREADY THINGS IN PLACE

02:57:57.500 --> 02:57:58.601
FOR THAT. I ALSO SEE THAT

02:57:58.667 --> 02:57:59.668
THERE'S AN EXEMPTION FOR SMOKE,

02:57:59.735 --> 02:58:02.805
BUT IT HAS TO DO. AND I KNOW IT

02:58:02.872 --> 02:58:03.439
WAS ALREADY BROUGHT UP, HAS TO

02:58:03.506 --> 02:58:05.541
DO WITH FIRE AS FAR AS LIKE A

02:58:05.608 --> 02:58:06.909
FOREST FIRE. WELL, I'VE GONE

02:58:06.976 --> 02:58:08.377
INTO BUILDINGS WHERE THE HOUSE

02:58:08.444 --> 02:58:10.479
IS ON FIRE AND I WANT TO COVER

02:58:10.546 --> 02:58:11.580
MY FACE. SO AM I NOW COMMITTING

02:58:11.647 --> 02:58:13.549
A MISDEMEANOR BY DOING THAT? BY

02:58:13.616 --> 02:58:14.917
GOING INTO PROTECT AND SAVE

02:58:14.984 --> 02:58:17.686
PEOPLE, WHICH I HAVE DONE.

02:58:17.753 --> 02:58:18.721
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS IN THIS

02:58:18.788 --> 02:58:21.357
BILL THAT NEED A LOT OF WORK ON,

02:58:21.424 --> 02:58:22.391
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE

02:58:22.458 --> 02:58:24.727
TRYING TO PUT IT THROUGH FAST

02:58:24.794 --> 02:58:25.961
AND QUICK, AND IT'S KIND OF A

02:58:26.028 --> 02:58:28.531
KNEE JERK. BILL TO GO AFTER THE

02:58:28.597 --> 02:58:29.331
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BUT I THINK

02:58:29.398 --> 02:58:30.699
THERE ARE BETTER WAYS TO DO

02:58:30.766 --> 02:58:32.868
THAT. AND I THINK WORKING WITH

02:58:32.935 --> 02:58:33.702
PORAC, THE SHERIFF'S, THE

02:58:33.769 --> 02:58:36.138
CHIEFS, THE PEACE OFFICERS

02:58:36.205 --> 02:58:36.906
ASSOCIATION, I THINK IS GOING TO

02:58:36.972 --> 02:58:39.408
BE OUR BEST WAY TO DO THAT. AND

02:58:39.475 --> 02:58:40.709
I THINK THERE'S OTHER THINGS

02:58:40.776 --> 02:58:41.811
THAT COULD BE DONE AS FAR AS

02:58:41.877 --> 02:58:44.680
LIKE WHEN WE DO A SWAT

02:58:44.747 --> 02:58:46.015
OPERATION, WE MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:58:46.082 --> 02:58:46.682
CALL IN ON A HOTLINE NUMBER TO

02:58:46.749 --> 02:58:48.617
REPORT WHERE WE'RE GOING. SO

02:58:48.684 --> 02:58:49.618
THAT WAY, IN CASE THERE'S

02:58:49.685 --> 02:58:50.419
ANOTHER AGENCY GOING IN TO DO

02:58:50.486 --> 02:58:52.621
THE SAME THING THAT WE DON'T

02:58:52.688 --> 02:58:54.090
ACCIDENTALLY HAVE FRIENDLY FIRE

02:58:54.156 --> 02:58:55.858
SITUATION. THERE COULD BE A BILL

02:58:55.925 --> 02:58:57.293
MAYBE THAT GOES ON WITH THAT. SO

02:58:57.359 --> 02:58:58.794
THAT WAY LAW ENFORCEMENT IS

02:58:58.861 --> 02:58:59.762
AWARE OKAY. YEAH. THERE'S

02:58:59.829 --> 02:59:00.663
SOMETHING GOING ON THERE. WE

02:59:00.729 --> 02:59:02.731
KNOW IT'S NOT A KIDNAPING AS AS

02:59:02.798 --> 02:59:04.567
BROUGHT UP. I THINK THERE'S SO

02:59:04.633 --> 02:59:06.335
MANY OTHER THINGS WE COULD DO. I

02:59:06.402 --> 02:59:09.105
THINK TURNING OUR TRUSTED LAW

02:59:09.171 --> 02:59:11.640
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES INTO

02:59:11.707 --> 02:59:13.075
CRIMINALS JUST FOR WEARING A

02:59:13.142 --> 02:59:15.344
MASK OR COVERING THEMSELVES TO

02:59:15.411 --> 02:59:17.146
PROTECT THEIR FAMILIES AND

02:59:17.213 --> 02:59:19.215
THEMSELVES IS NOT THE ANSWER.

02:59:19.281 --> 02:59:20.916
AND SO I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING

02:59:20.983 --> 02:59:22.418
THE SENATOR, I APOLOGIZE. THANK

02:59:22.485 --> 02:59:24.353
YOU VERY MUCH, MR. VICE CHAIR.

02:59:24.420 --> 02:59:26.122
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS?

02:59:26.188 --> 02:59:30.025
ALL RIGHT. I'D LIKE TO WEIGH IN.

02:59:30.092 --> 02:59:31.260
OKAY. DO YOU MIND IF I ASK A

02:59:31.327 --> 02:59:32.461
QUESTION FIRST, MR. GONZALEZ?

02:59:32.528 --> 02:59:34.296
OKAY. THANK YOU. I'M NOT GOING

02:59:34.363 --> 02:59:36.132
TO GIVE MY RECOMMENDATION YET,

02:59:36.198 --> 02:59:36.932
BUT, SENATOR, I DID WANT TO

02:59:36.999 --> 02:59:39.401
DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION TO SECTION

02:59:39.468 --> 02:59:41.437
ONE OF THE PROPOSED BILL. I. YOU

02:59:41.504 --> 02:59:43.672
KNOW, THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

02:59:43.739 --> 02:59:44.507
SUGGESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE BILL

02:59:44.573 --> 02:59:46.208
DOES. DO. I WANT TO BE

02:59:46.275 --> 02:59:47.643
INCREDIBLY CLEAR. IF AN OFFICER

02:59:47.710 --> 02:59:49.411
NEEDED A MEDICAL GRADE MASK OR A

02:59:49.478 --> 02:59:50.746
SURGICAL OR N95 RESPIRATOR

02:59:50.813 --> 02:59:51.914
DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE

02:59:51.981 --> 02:59:53.149
TRANSMISSION OF AIRBORNE

02:59:53.215 --> 02:59:54.216
DISEASES, SUCH AS IN THE

02:59:54.283 --> 02:59:56.118
INCIDENT OF INSTANCE OF COVID,

02:59:56.185 --> 02:59:57.620
THAT WOULD BE AN EXEMPTION UNDER

02:59:57.686 --> 03:00:00.256
THE BILL, CORRECT? YES, YES. AND

03:00:00.322 --> 03:00:01.924
TO THE VICE CHAIRS POINT A MASK

03:00:01.991 --> 03:00:03.125
DESIGNED TO PROTECT AGAINST

03:00:03.192 --> 03:00:04.426
EXPOSURE TO SMOKE DURING A STATE

03:00:04.493 --> 03:00:05.561
OF EMERGENCY RELATED TO

03:00:05.628 --> 03:00:06.428
WILDFIRE. THAT WOULD BE AN

03:00:06.495 --> 03:00:08.230
EXEMPTION, CORRECT? YES.

03:00:08.297 --> 03:00:09.331
PROTECTIVE GEAR USED BY SWAT.

03:00:09.398 --> 03:00:10.766
THAT'S SPECIAL WEAPONS AND

03:00:10.833 --> 03:00:12.501
TACTICS. TEAM OFFICERS NECESSARY

03:00:12.568 --> 03:00:14.503
TO PROTECT THEIR FACES FROM HARM

03:00:14.570 --> 03:00:15.938
WHILE THEY PERFORM THEIR SWAT

03:00:16.005 --> 03:00:16.539
RESPONSIBILITIES. THAT'S AN

03:00:16.605 --> 03:00:17.873
EXEMPTION, CORRECT? YES. AND I

03:00:17.940 --> 03:00:19.408
DON'T KNOW ABOUT SAN FRANCISCO,

03:00:19.475 --> 03:00:22.011
BUT IN LOS ANGELES, I SEE SWAT

03:00:22.077 --> 03:00:22.611
OFFICERS WEAR THE PROTECTIVE

03:00:22.678 --> 03:00:24.046
SHIELD. IT COVERS THEIR FACE

03:00:24.113 --> 03:00:25.447
REGULARLY IN THE COURSE OF THOSE

03:00:25.514 --> 03:00:27.249
DUTIES. THAT WHAT YOU'VE SEEN IN

03:00:27.316 --> 03:00:28.384
SAN FRANCISCO, TOO? YES. IN

03:00:28.450 --> 03:00:29.518
ADDITION, THE AMENDMENTS

03:00:29.585 --> 03:00:30.586
PROPOSED BY THE COMMITTEE, WHICH

03:00:30.653 --> 03:00:33.422
YOU HAVE AGREED TO ALSO EXEMPT

03:00:33.489 --> 03:00:34.056
UNDERCOVER OPERATIONS, CORRECT?

03:00:34.123 --> 03:00:37.593
CORRECT. OKAY. MR. GONZALEZ,

03:00:37.660 --> 03:00:40.362
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADD? CAN

03:00:40.429 --> 03:00:42.198
YOU WHAT WERE THE FIRST COUPLE

03:00:42.264 --> 03:00:44.233
OF PIECES TO THAT THAT YOU WERE

03:00:44.300 --> 03:00:45.334
ASKING? YOU WERE YOU TALKED

03:00:45.401 --> 03:00:46.202
ABOUT UNDERCOVER, YOU TALKED

03:00:46.268 --> 03:00:47.770
ABOUT SWAT AND YOU TALKED ABOUT

03:00:47.836 --> 03:00:48.704
I COULDN'T FIND IT. MEDICAL AND

03:00:48.771 --> 03:00:50.306
SMOKE. SMOKE AND MEDICAL SMOKE

03:00:50.372 --> 03:00:51.607
AND MEDICAL. OKAY, LOOK, THE

03:00:51.674 --> 03:00:54.710
ONLY DISTINCTION IS THAT BANK

03:00:54.777 --> 03:00:56.779
ROBBERS GO INTO A BANK WEARING A

03:00:56.845 --> 03:00:58.914
SKI MASK TO HIDE THEIR IDENTITY.

03:00:58.981 --> 03:01:00.816
LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOULD NOT DO

03:01:00.883 --> 03:01:03.686
THE SAME. AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

03:01:03.752 --> 03:01:05.788
SITUATIONS OF UNDERCOVER SWAT,

03:01:05.854 --> 03:01:07.289
ALL OF THESE PIECES THAT ARE

03:01:07.356 --> 03:01:09.458
AMENDMENTS TO IT, THOSE ARE

03:01:09.525 --> 03:01:11.460
RESPONSES TO EMERGENCIES OR

03:01:11.527 --> 03:01:12.695
UNDERCOVER COPS WHO ARE TRYING

03:01:12.761 --> 03:01:15.531
TO TAKE OVER A SITUATION. MASKED

03:01:15.598 --> 03:01:16.966
INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT BEING CALLED

03:01:17.032 --> 03:01:18.867
UPON TO COME AND TAKE A PERSON

03:01:18.934 --> 03:01:20.936
OUT OF THEIR CAR, OUT OF A

03:01:21.003 --> 03:01:22.471
GRADUATION, OUT OF A CHURCH. SO

03:01:22.538 --> 03:01:23.572
THE DISTINCTION I WANT TO MAKE,

03:01:23.639 --> 03:01:24.640
AND BECAUSE IT'S BEEN LOS

03:01:24.707 --> 03:01:26.308
ANGELES THAT HAS BEEN MENTIONED,

03:01:26.375 --> 03:01:27.610
MASKED INDIVIDUALS ARE SHOWING

03:01:27.676 --> 03:01:29.945
UP UNANNOUNCED TO KIDNAP

03:01:30.012 --> 03:01:31.447
INDIVIDUALS. THEY ARE NOT

03:01:31.513 --> 03:01:33.449
RESPONDING TO AN EMERGENCY OR A

03:01:33.515 --> 03:01:35.317
FIRE, OR TO A SWAT OPERATION OR

03:01:35.384 --> 03:01:38.520
TO A PROTEST. THEY ARE GOING TO

03:01:38.587 --> 03:01:40.389
INNOCENT PEOPLE'S HOMES, PLACES

03:01:40.456 --> 03:01:43.626
OF WORK AND WORSHIP, MASKED TO

03:01:43.692 --> 03:01:45.761
KIDNAP WITH AN AGENDA. THESE ARE

03:01:45.828 --> 03:01:47.930
BOUNTY HUNTERS. AND THAT'S THE

03:01:47.997 --> 03:01:48.998
DISTINCTION. WHEN LAW

03:01:49.064 --> 03:01:49.798
ENFORCEMENT IS SHOWING UP

03:01:49.865 --> 03:01:52.134
WEARING A MASK, IT'S BECAUSE OF

03:01:52.201 --> 03:01:53.702
THE SITUATION AT HAND TO PROTECT

03:01:53.769 --> 03:01:55.904
AND SEAL THEMSELVES FROM GOING

03:01:55.971 --> 03:01:58.440
INTO THAT FIRE OR INTO THAT

03:01:58.507 --> 03:01:59.742
SITUATION. THE DISTINCTION IS

03:01:59.808 --> 03:02:01.577
THAT MASKED INDIVIDUALS ARE

03:02:01.644 --> 03:02:04.813
SHOWING UP WITHOUT BEING CALLED

03:02:04.880 --> 03:02:06.882
TO CAUSE HARM AND CHAOS ON

03:02:06.949 --> 03:02:08.384
INNOCENT PEOPLE. THERE'S A

03:02:08.450 --> 03:02:10.419
DIFFERENCE THERE. THANK YOU VERY

03:02:10.486 --> 03:02:12.388
MUCH. WE'LL NEXT GO TO OUR VICE

03:02:12.454 --> 03:02:13.922
CHAIR, WHO HAD A POINT HE FORGOT

03:02:13.989 --> 03:02:15.791
TO MENTION. MR. CHAIR, THANK YOU

03:02:15.858 --> 03:02:17.826
FOR THAT. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE

03:02:17.893 --> 03:02:19.261
A POINT ON THE ME TOO'S. NOT

03:02:19.328 --> 03:02:21.163
ONCE DID I SEE A FEDERAL AGENCY

03:02:21.230 --> 03:02:23.632
COME UP TO SAY THAT THEY WERE A

03:02:23.699 --> 03:02:24.633
SUPPORTER OPPOSED BECAUSE THIS

03:02:24.700 --> 03:02:25.834
DOES NOT APPLY TO THEM AND THEY

03:02:25.901 --> 03:02:28.904
DO NOT CARE. THANK YOU. ALL

03:02:28.971 --> 03:02:30.439
RIGHT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR

03:02:30.506 --> 03:02:31.640
COMMENTS? I WILL NOTE THAT WE

03:02:31.707 --> 03:02:33.208
HAVE A MOTION BY MR. GONZALEZ.

03:02:33.275 --> 03:02:36.145
IS THERE A SECOND? I WILL SECOND

03:02:36.211 --> 03:02:39.148
SEN WIENER. YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK

03:02:39.214 --> 03:02:40.783
YOU VERY MUCH, MR. CHAIR AND

03:02:40.849 --> 03:02:42.551
COLLEAGUES. THANK YOU FOR THE

03:02:42.618 --> 03:02:45.821
THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATION. YOU

03:02:45.888 --> 03:02:49.058
KNOW, I, I DO WANT TO SAY THAT

03:02:49.124 --> 03:02:50.659
FEDERAL AGENTS ARE SUBJECT TO

03:02:50.726 --> 03:02:53.362
QUITE A FEW CALIFORNIA STATE

03:02:53.429 --> 03:02:55.831
LAWS, AND SO THEY MAY NOT HAVE

03:02:55.898 --> 03:02:57.299
BEEN HERE TODAY. THEY THE

03:02:57.366 --> 03:03:00.169
ARROGANCE OF THIS ADMINISTRATION

03:03:00.235 --> 03:03:02.705
MAKES THAT NOT SURPRISING. AND

03:03:02.771 --> 03:03:05.741
SO, YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT AT ALL

03:03:05.808 --> 03:03:07.209
SURPRISING THAT THEY WOULD THAT

03:03:07.276 --> 03:03:09.144
THEY WOULD BLOW THIS UP OFF AND

03:03:09.211 --> 03:03:11.747
NOT ENGAGE. BUT THEY THERE ARE

03:03:11.814 --> 03:03:13.515
VARIOUS STATE LAWS THAT FEDERAL

03:03:13.582 --> 03:03:14.917
EMPLOYEES, FEDERAL AGENTS CAN

03:03:14.983 --> 03:03:17.219
VIOLATE AND BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE

03:03:17.286 --> 03:03:19.021
FOR UNDER STATE LAW. WEARING A

03:03:19.088 --> 03:03:20.856
FEDERAL BADGE DOES NOT MAKE YOU

03:03:20.923 --> 03:03:22.891
A GOD. DESPITE WHAT THIS

03:03:22.958 --> 03:03:24.226
ADMINISTRATION MAY THINK OF

03:03:24.293 --> 03:03:30.165
ITSELF. SO YOU KNOW. AND I ALSO

03:03:30.232 --> 03:03:32.334
JUST WANT TO POINT OUT ASSEMBLY

03:03:32.401 --> 03:03:34.136
MEMBER, MR. VICE CHAIR, OR

03:03:34.203 --> 03:03:35.938
EXCUSE ME, SENATOR LACKEY, IN

03:03:36.004 --> 03:03:37.639
TERMS OF COMMUNICATION WITH ICE,

03:03:37.706 --> 03:03:40.609
WE HAVE NOT. I DO KNOW THAT

03:03:40.676 --> 03:03:43.112
NUMEROUS MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IN

03:03:43.178 --> 03:03:44.546
CALIFORNIA HAVE TRIED TO ENGAGE

03:03:44.613 --> 03:03:46.181
WITH ICE ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON,

03:03:46.248 --> 03:03:48.283
AND THEY HAVE CONSISTENTLY BEEN

03:03:48.350 --> 03:03:49.918
BLOWN OFF. FORTUNATELY, NO

03:03:49.985 --> 03:03:51.754
MEMBER, NO CALIFORNIA MEMBERS OF

03:03:51.820 --> 03:03:53.822
CONGRESS HAVE BEEN CRIMINALLY

03:03:53.889 --> 03:03:55.124
PROSECUTED. YET. WE'RE SEEING

03:03:55.190 --> 03:03:56.859
THAT ON THE EAST COAST. WE DID

03:03:56.925 --> 03:03:59.428
SEE OUR U.S. SENATOR GET TACKLED

03:03:59.495 --> 03:04:00.562
AND HANDCUFFED FOR HAVING THE

03:04:00.629 --> 03:04:05.401
GALL TO QUESTION SECRETARY NOME.

03:04:05.467 --> 03:04:08.270
SO I THINK THERE'S BEEN A LITTLE

03:04:08.337 --> 03:04:11.907
BIT OF A PITTING SB 805 AND SB

03:04:11.974 --> 03:04:13.942
627 AGAINST EACH OTHER TODAY.

03:04:14.009 --> 03:04:15.110
SENATOR PEREZ AND I, IN ADDITION

03:04:15.177 --> 03:04:17.279
TO SENATOR ARREGUIN, WE ARE TIED

03:04:17.346 --> 03:04:18.947
AT THE HIP ON THESE BILLS. THESE

03:04:19.014 --> 03:04:20.783
BILLS ARE COMPLETELY

03:04:20.849 --> 03:04:22.451
COMPLEMENTARY. THESE ARE TWO

03:04:22.518 --> 03:04:24.219
ISSUES THAT ARE THEY ARE

03:04:24.286 --> 03:04:25.487
DIFFERENT, BUT THEY ARE IN MANY

03:04:25.554 --> 03:04:29.158
WAYS THE SAME ABOUT ENSURING

03:04:29.224 --> 03:04:31.360
THAT PEOPLE KNOW WHO IS A POLICE

03:04:31.427 --> 03:04:33.462
OFFICER OR A LAW ENFORCEMENT

03:04:33.529 --> 03:04:35.531
OFFICER AND WHO ISN'T, AND THAT

03:04:35.597 --> 03:04:38.500
PEOPLE ARE NOT SUBJECTED TO THIS

03:04:38.567 --> 03:04:41.103
KIND OF TERROR, WHICH IS

03:04:41.170 --> 03:04:41.670
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AT THE

03:04:41.737 --> 03:04:43.272
FEDERAL LEVEL. AND WE WANT TO

03:04:43.338 --> 03:04:45.007
MAKE SURE THAT THAT NEVER, EVER

03:04:45.073 --> 03:04:48.243
HAPPENS AT ANY LEVEL. THESE TWO

03:04:48.310 --> 03:04:51.113
BILLS WORK IN TANDEM, AND THAT'S

03:04:51.180 --> 03:04:53.515
WHY WE SAW IN THE US SENATE BILL

03:04:53.582 --> 03:04:55.551
BY SENATOR PADILLA, THE TWO

03:04:55.617 --> 03:04:56.652
BILLS OR VERSIONS OF THEM WERE

03:04:56.718 --> 03:04:59.087
PUT INTO ONE BILL, BOTH THE

03:04:59.154 --> 03:05:00.589
MASKING AND IDENTIFICATION. THIS

03:05:00.656 --> 03:05:02.724
IS NOT ABOUT ONE OR THE OTHER.

03:05:02.791 --> 03:05:04.259
IT'S BOTH INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT

03:05:04.326 --> 03:05:05.594
IF YOU'RE WEARING A BADGE, BUT

03:05:05.661 --> 03:05:06.929
YOU'RE ALSO WEARING A SKI MASK,

03:05:06.995 --> 03:05:09.364
THAT IS STILL HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC

03:05:09.431 --> 03:05:11.633
AND TERRIFYING, AND WE SHOULDN'T

03:05:11.700 --> 03:05:16.305
BE ALLOWING IT. SB 805, LIKE SB

03:05:16.371 --> 03:05:19.308
627, CONTAINS A MISDEMEANOR IN

03:05:19.374 --> 03:05:23.912
IT, SO, YOU KNOW, I UNDERSTAND,

03:05:23.979 --> 03:05:25.113
YOU KNOW, THE CONCERNS FROM

03:05:25.180 --> 03:05:26.448
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND LIKE

03:05:26.515 --> 03:05:27.783
I SAID, I'VE BEEN A LONG

03:05:27.850 --> 03:05:30.018
SUPPORTER OF MY OWN LOCAL LAW

03:05:30.085 --> 03:05:31.820
ENFORCEMENT. THIS IS NOT ABOUT

03:05:31.887 --> 03:05:34.656
IN ANY WAY DEMONIZING. THIS IS

03:05:34.723 --> 03:05:36.258
ABOUT SETTING CLEAR STANDARDS

03:05:36.325 --> 03:05:37.826
THAT ARE APPLICABLE TO ALL LAW

03:05:37.893 --> 03:05:40.229
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. AND THIS

03:05:40.295 --> 03:05:42.064
IS SO IMPORTANT FOR THE PEOPLE

03:05:42.130 --> 03:05:44.566
OF CALIFORNIA SO FAR, TOO MANY

03:05:44.633 --> 03:05:47.236
OF WHOM ARE LIVING IN ABSOLUTE

03:05:47.302 --> 03:05:51.173
TERROR RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW, I

03:05:51.240 --> 03:05:53.742
TALKED ABOUT THIS ON THE SENATE

03:05:53.809 --> 03:05:55.577
FLOOR A COUPLE WEEKS AGO, AND

03:05:55.644 --> 03:05:57.713
I'LL REPEAT IT AGAIN TODAY THAT

03:05:57.779 --> 03:05:59.314
I WAS RECENTLY ON THE SUBWAY IN

03:05:59.381 --> 03:06:01.283
SAN FRANCISCO, SITTING NEXT TO A

03:06:01.350 --> 03:06:03.752
GUY WHO I'VE KNOWN JUST FROM THE

03:06:03.819 --> 03:06:06.221
NEIGHBORHOOD FOR 15 PLUS YEARS,

03:06:06.288 --> 03:06:10.659
WHO IS AN IMMIGRANT FROM MEXICO,

03:06:10.726 --> 03:06:12.494
RESIDENT OF THE CASTRO, WHO

03:06:12.561 --> 03:06:14.429
TURNED TO ME AND SAID, I GUESS

03:06:14.496 --> 03:06:17.332
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GO BACK TO

03:06:17.399 --> 03:06:18.834
MEXICO. HE'S LIVED HERE FOR 30

03:06:18.901 --> 03:06:20.769
YEARS AND HE'S A CITIZEN. THAT'S

03:06:20.836 --> 03:06:22.271
WHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW. AND

03:06:22.337 --> 03:06:23.906
YES, IT'S ABOUT UNDOCUMENTED

03:06:23.972 --> 03:06:26.174
PEOPLE, BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT

03:06:26.241 --> 03:06:28.010
IMMIGRANTS WHO ARE HERE WITH

03:06:28.076 --> 03:06:30.045
PAPERS AND EVEN US CITIZENS

03:06:30.112 --> 03:06:31.580
BECAUSE THEY'RE THREATENING TO

03:06:31.647 --> 03:06:33.048
DENATURALIZE PEOPLE. AND NOW

03:06:33.115 --> 03:06:34.950
EVEN A NATURAL BORN US CITIZEN,

03:06:35.017 --> 03:06:36.351
HE'S THREATENING TO REVOKE

03:06:36.418 --> 03:06:38.186
CITIZENSHIP, THIS FASCIST STATE

03:06:38.253 --> 03:06:40.622
THAT THEY'RE SETTING UP IS ONLY

03:06:40.689 --> 03:06:42.457
GROWING, PARTICULARLY WITH THE

03:06:42.524 --> 03:06:44.626
$45 BILLION THAT THEY JUST PUKED

03:06:44.693 --> 03:06:47.563
ONTO ICE TO CONTINUE TO BUILD

03:06:47.629 --> 03:06:49.598
THIS POLICE STATE. IT'S ONLY

03:06:49.665 --> 03:06:51.533
GROWING. WE HAVE TO GET OUT IN

03:06:51.600 --> 03:06:52.768
FRONT OF IT. IT'S TIME TO SET

03:06:52.834 --> 03:06:55.404
CLEAR STANDARDS FOR ALL LAW

03:06:55.470 --> 03:06:56.471
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. AND I

03:06:56.538 --> 03:06:58.206
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE

03:06:58.273 --> 03:06:59.474
VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH,

03:06:59.541 --> 03:07:02.244
SENATOR. SO, COLLEAGUES, I HAVE

03:07:02.311 --> 03:07:03.445
A LITTLE BIT LONGER OF A

03:07:03.512 --> 03:07:04.413
RECOMMENDATION TODAY, BUT THE

03:07:04.479 --> 03:07:06.515
SHORT ANSWER IS I WILL BE

03:07:06.582 --> 03:07:07.416
RECOMMENDING AN AYE. I'M GOING

03:07:07.482 --> 03:07:09.351
TO START BY SAYING I'M NOT OFTEN

03:07:09.418 --> 03:07:10.419
INCORRECT, BUT I WAS INCORRECT

03:07:10.485 --> 03:07:11.920
IN THIS INSTANCE. AND I DO

03:07:11.987 --> 03:07:13.455
BELIEVE IN ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE

03:07:13.522 --> 03:07:14.556
VICE MAYOR'S CONCERN. THE

03:07:14.623 --> 03:07:15.457
COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ACTUALLY DO

03:07:15.524 --> 03:07:16.291
ADDRESS THE INSTANCE OF AN

03:07:16.358 --> 03:07:18.260
OFFICER WEARING A MASK FOR

03:07:18.327 --> 03:07:19.461
PURPOSES OF ANY ENVIRONMENTAL

03:07:19.528 --> 03:07:20.929
HAZARD. I WOULD SIMPLY NOTE THAT

03:07:20.996 --> 03:07:22.798
B1, WHICH DEFINES A FACE

03:07:22.864 --> 03:07:24.466
COVERING AND B2 HAVE A COUPLE

03:07:24.533 --> 03:07:25.434
EXEMPTIONS, AND I'LL JUST READ

03:07:25.500 --> 03:07:28.570
THIS PORTION TWO SUB TWO AN N95

03:07:28.637 --> 03:07:30.105
MEDICAL MASK OR SURGICAL MASK.

03:07:30.172 --> 03:07:31.340
I'M GOING TO SKIP AHEAD HERE

03:07:31.406 --> 03:07:33.775
BECAUSE THERE'S MORE NECESSARY

03:07:33.842 --> 03:07:35.043
TO PROTECT AGAINST EXPOSURE TO

03:07:35.110 --> 03:07:37.045
ANY TOXIN, GAS, SMOKE, OR ANY

03:07:37.112 --> 03:07:38.580
OTHER HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENTAL

03:07:38.647 --> 03:07:40.115
CONDITION, NOT JUST LIMITED TO

03:07:40.182 --> 03:07:42.250
WILDLAND FIRES. SO I STAND

03:07:42.317 --> 03:07:43.785
CORRECTED, AND I WANTED THAT TO

03:07:43.852 --> 03:07:44.753
BE EXTRAORDINARILY CLEAR.

03:07:44.820 --> 03:07:45.821
HOPEFULLY, THAT ADDRESSES AT

03:07:45.887 --> 03:07:47.522
LEAST THAT NARROW CONCERN OF THE

03:07:47.589 --> 03:07:49.391
VICE CHAIR. I WANT TO THANK THE

03:07:49.458 --> 03:07:51.026
SENATOR FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD.

03:07:51.093 --> 03:07:52.227
WE'RE HERE TODAY BECAUSE WE HAVE

03:07:52.294 --> 03:07:53.495
A DICTATOR IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

03:07:53.562 --> 03:07:55.564
WE HAVE A TYRANT. WE HAVE

03:07:55.631 --> 03:07:56.598
SOMEONE WHO IS UNFIT TO SERVE IN

03:07:56.665 --> 03:07:58.400
THE OFFICE, SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN

03:07:58.467 --> 03:07:59.801
CONVICTED 34 TIMES AND HAS BEEN

03:07:59.868 --> 03:08:01.303
HELD TO NO ACCOUNT, SOMEONE WHO

03:08:01.370 --> 03:08:03.105
SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM POWER

03:08:03.171 --> 03:08:03.739
IMMEDIATELY. THAT'S NOT REALLY

03:08:03.805 --> 03:08:05.107
WHAT THE BILL IS ABOUT. THIS

03:08:05.173 --> 03:08:07.075
BILL IS ABOUT PROTECTING OUR

03:08:07.142 --> 03:08:08.543
COMMUNITIES. WE HAVE SEEN ACROSS

03:08:08.610 --> 03:08:10.712
THE STATE AND ESPECIALLY IN LOS

03:08:10.779 --> 03:08:13.915
ANGELES, ICE TERRORIZE OUR

03:08:13.982 --> 03:08:15.183
COMMUNITIES. AND IT'S

03:08:15.250 --> 03:08:17.252
FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG. WHEN YOU

03:08:17.319 --> 03:08:18.453
LOOK AT WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

03:08:18.520 --> 03:08:19.655
DOING, LOOK NO FURTHER THAN

03:08:19.721 --> 03:08:21.590
PROJECT 2025. WE'VE SEEN THIS

03:08:21.657 --> 03:08:23.925
PLAYBOOK PLAY OUT, REFERENCED

03:08:23.992 --> 03:08:26.461
1930S GERMANY. SECRET POLICE

03:08:26.528 --> 03:08:29.031
HAVE NO PLACE IN THE STATE OF

03:08:29.097 --> 03:08:29.631
CALIFORNIA. THIS IS WHAT THE

03:08:29.698 --> 03:08:31.833
BILL GUARDS AGAINST. NOW TO THE

03:08:31.900 --> 03:08:33.402
OPPOSITION TESTIMONY. I

03:08:33.468 --> 03:08:34.369
UNDERSTAND THE PERSPECTIVE OF

03:08:34.436 --> 03:08:36.838
AND I WANT TO BE CRYSTAL CLEAR

03:08:36.905 --> 03:08:37.539
HERE. I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY

03:08:37.606 --> 03:08:39.441
DOCUMENTED INSTANCE WHERE LOCAL

03:08:39.508 --> 03:08:40.008
OR STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE

03:08:40.075 --> 03:08:42.277
DOING ANY OF THIS. AND I GET

03:08:42.344 --> 03:08:43.378
YOUR CONCERN, AND I GET THE

03:08:43.445 --> 03:08:45.514
DESIRE TO NOT WANT TO BE LOOPED

03:08:45.580 --> 03:08:46.581
IN. YOU'RE NOT DOING THIS.

03:08:46.648 --> 03:08:47.883
YOU'RE NOT TERRORIZING OUR

03:08:47.949 --> 03:08:48.483
COMMUNITY. AND I GET THAT. BUT

03:08:48.550 --> 03:08:50.986
THIS BILL IS BIGGER THAN JUST

03:08:51.053 --> 03:08:52.020
YOU. THIS IS ABOUT EXPRESSING

03:08:52.087 --> 03:08:53.455
OUR VALUES AS A STATE. THIS IS

03:08:53.522 --> 03:08:54.923
ABOUT STAYING, ABOUT SAYING

03:08:54.990 --> 03:08:56.692
WHETHER IT IS FEDERAL LAW

03:08:56.758 --> 03:08:57.693
ENFORCEMENT OR LOCAL OR STATE.

03:08:57.759 --> 03:08:59.528
THERE IS NO PLACE FOR THE

03:08:59.594 --> 03:09:00.762
ACTIVITIES OF SECRET POLICE IN A

03:09:00.829 --> 03:09:02.431
FREE AND DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY.

03:09:02.497 --> 03:09:04.199
IT'S A SAD DAY THAT WE HAVE TO

03:09:04.266 --> 03:09:06.368
TALK ABOUT A BILL LIKE THIS, BUT

03:09:06.435 --> 03:09:07.803
FAILURE TO PASS THIS BILL

03:09:07.869 --> 03:09:08.904
JEOPARDIZES EVERY SINGLE ONE OF

03:09:08.970 --> 03:09:11.173
US IN OUR FREEDOM. I'M PROUD TO

03:09:11.239 --> 03:09:12.574
SUPPORT THIS BILL. I'M PROUD TO

03:09:12.641 --> 03:09:14.209
RECOMMEND, AND I AND SENATOR,

03:09:14.276 --> 03:09:15.544
I'D BE HONORED TO HAVE YOU ON,

03:09:15.610 --> 03:09:17.546
IF YOU'D HAVE ME ON AS A

03:09:17.612 --> 03:09:18.480
COAUTHOR. WITH THAT, LET'S

03:09:18.547 --> 03:09:21.550
CONDUCT THE ROLE. THANK YOU. ON

ADDRESS THE VERY REAL PROBLEM OF

03:11:05.987 --> 03:11:08.456
SALE OF STOLEN GOODS ON OUR

03:11:08.523 --> 03:11:10.492
STREETS AND THE HARM THAT IT'S

03:11:10.559 --> 03:11:12.360
DOING TO OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND

03:11:12.427 --> 03:11:15.564
TO OUR AMAZING STREET VENDOR

03:11:15.630 --> 03:11:18.033
ECOSYSTEM. I'M I WANT TO START

03:11:18.099 --> 03:11:19.868
BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE

03:11:19.935 --> 03:11:21.903

AUTHOR AND MANY ISSUES THAT YOU

03:22:25.700 --> 03:22:27.134
CHAMPIONED, WE ARE IN RESPECTFUL

03:22:27.201 --> 03:22:29.837
OPPOSITION TO THIS PROPOSAL. SB

03:22:29.904 --> 03:22:31.639
276 WOULD DANGEROUSLY,

03:22:31.706 --> 03:22:33.074
DANGEROUSLY ROLLBACK THE

03:22:33.140 --> 03:22:34.175
DECRIMINALIZATION OF STREET

03:22:34.242 --> 03:22:35.142
VENDING, WHICH WAS ACCOMPLISHED

03:22:35.209 --> 03:22:36.978
WITH THE SAFE SIDEWALK VENDING

03:22:37.044 --> 03:22:38.813
ACT, AUTHORED BY THEN-SENATOR

03:22:38.880 --> 03:22:40.615
LATA. WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE

03:22:40.681 --> 03:22:41.716
AUTHOR NOT IMPOSING A

03:22:41.782 --> 03:22:42.683
MISDEMEANOR UNTIL A FOURTH

03:22:42.750 --> 03:22:44.919
CHARGE WITHIN 18 MONTHS, WE HAVE

03:22:44.986 --> 03:22:46.854
SERIOUS CONCERNS WITH IMPOSING A

03:22:46.921 --> 03:22:48.789
MISDEMEANOR AT ALL. AS THE AS

03:22:48.856 --> 03:22:50.258
THERE ARE, THERE'S A

03:22:50.324 --> 03:22:51.425
CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF EVIDENCE

03:22:51.492 --> 03:22:53.394
THAT SUGGESTS LONGER SENTENCING

03:22:53.461 --> 03:22:53.995
DOES LITTLE TO DETER CRIME,

03:22:54.061 --> 03:22:56.898
WHICH I KNOW I REPEAT A LOT UP

03:22:56.964 --> 03:22:58.366
HERE AT THIS TABLE. SO STUDIES

03:22:58.432 --> 03:23:00.034
HAVE CONCLUDED THAT CERTAINTY OF

03:23:00.101 --> 03:23:01.369
PUNISHMENT HAS A GREATER

03:23:01.435 --> 03:23:02.837
DETERRENCE THAN THE SEVERITY OF

03:23:02.904 --> 03:23:05.072
THE PUNISHMENT ITSELF. RIGHT. SO

03:23:05.139 --> 03:23:06.974
I POSED THIS QUESTION TO THE

03:23:07.041 --> 03:23:08.276
POLICYMAKERS IN THIS ROOM. IF

03:23:08.342 --> 03:23:10.111
OUR OBJECTIVE HERE IS TO DETER

03:23:10.177 --> 03:23:11.979
PEOPLE FROM SELLING STOLEN

03:23:12.046 --> 03:23:13.381
MERCHANDISE ON PUBLIC SIDEWALKS,

03:23:13.447 --> 03:23:14.849
WHAT EVIDENCE DO WE HAVE TO

03:23:14.916 --> 03:23:16.017
OFFER THAT THE CRIMINAL

03:23:16.083 --> 03:23:17.952
PENALTIES IN THIS BILL WOULD

03:23:18.019 --> 03:23:19.787
RESOLVE THIS ISSUE? AS THE

03:23:19.854 --> 03:23:21.556
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT ON

03:23:21.622 --> 03:23:24.091
PAGES 9 TO 11, THERE ARE

03:23:24.158 --> 03:23:24.859
NUMEROUS PENALTIES THAT CAN

03:23:24.926 --> 03:23:26.661
CURRENTLY BE USED TO ADDRESS THE

03:23:26.727 --> 03:23:27.995
TYPE OF RETAIL THEFT AND FENCING

03:23:28.062 --> 03:23:30.031
AT ISSUE IN THIS BILL, INCLUDING

03:23:30.097 --> 03:23:33.434
PENAL CODE SECTION 496. SO

03:23:33.501 --> 03:23:34.835
AGAIN, TO REITERATE, LAW

03:23:34.902 --> 03:23:37.471
ENFORCEMENT ALREADY HAS TOOLS TO

03:23:37.538 --> 03:23:39.907
GET AFTER WHAT THIS BILL IS

03:23:39.974 --> 03:23:43.477
TRYING TO RESOLVE. THE PUNITIVE

03:23:43.544 --> 03:23:44.845
MEASURES PROPOSED IN THIS BILL

03:23:44.912 --> 03:23:46.113
WOULD DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT

03:23:46.180 --> 03:23:47.481
VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES,

03:23:47.548 --> 03:23:48.616
PARTICULARLY PEOPLE WHO ARE LOW

03:23:48.683 --> 03:23:50.017
INCOME AND IMMIGRANTS THAT MAY

03:23:50.084 --> 03:23:52.286
RESORT TO STREET VENDING AS A

03:23:52.353 --> 03:23:53.220
PRIMARY MEANS OF SURVIVAL.

03:23:53.287 --> 03:23:54.789
CRIMINALIZING UNPERMITTED

03:23:54.855 --> 03:23:56.557
VENDING RISK, WORSENING ECONOMIC

03:23:56.624 --> 03:23:58.659
HARDSHIP, AND DEEPENING EXISTING

03:23:58.726 --> 03:23:59.894
INEQUITIES. AND I ALSO WANT TO

03:23:59.961 --> 03:24:01.262
POINT OUT TO THE COMMITTEE ON

03:24:01.329 --> 03:24:02.530
PAGE 11, IN THE COMMITTEE

03:24:02.597 --> 03:24:05.533
ANALYSIS WITH THE STATED REASON

03:24:05.600 --> 03:24:07.335
FOR THE URGENCY CLAUSE IS

03:24:07.401 --> 03:24:09.103
BECAUSE OF THIS RAMPANT INCREASE

03:24:09.170 --> 03:24:12.406
IN RETAIL THEFT. HERE IN THE

03:24:12.473 --> 03:24:14.108
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS, IT SAYS AS

03:24:14.175 --> 03:24:15.876
2024 CRIME RATES IN SAN

03:24:15.943 --> 03:24:17.478
FRANCISCO DROPPED TO THEIR

03:24:17.545 --> 03:24:19.614
LOWEST POINT IN TWO DECADES. AND

03:24:19.680 --> 03:24:21.749
SPECIFIC TO PROPERTY CRIME, SAN

03:24:21.816 --> 03:24:23.184
FRANCISCO REDUCTION IN PROPERTY

03:24:23.250 --> 03:24:24.552
CRIME FROM THE LAST YEAR WAS THE

03:24:24.619 --> 03:24:26.087
LARGEST OF ANY COMPARABLE SIZED

03:24:26.153 --> 03:24:28.322
CITY. SO FOR THESE REASONS, WE

03:24:28.389 --> 03:24:30.858
DO NOT FIND THIS BILL TO BE

03:24:30.925 --> 03:24:31.459
NECESSARY AND WE RESPECTFULLY

03:24:31.525 --> 03:24:33.527
URGE YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU.

03:24:33.594 --> 03:24:35.396
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANYONE ELSE

03:24:35.463 --> 03:24:36.497
IN OPPOSITION? PLEASE STEP UP.

03:24:36.564 --> 03:24:37.665
NAME? ORGANIZATION. YOUR

03:24:37.732 --> 03:24:40.134
POSITION PLEASE. GWEN GUNHEIM,

03:24:40.201 --> 03:24:42.303
ON BEHALF OF SAN FRANCISCO

03:24:42.370 --> 03:24:44.271
PUBLIC DEFENDERS, RESPECTFULLY

03:24:44.338 --> 03:24:48.676
OPPOSE. SERGEANT, DO WE HAVE

03:24:48.743 --> 03:24:51.278
ANYONE ELSE? NOPE. OKAY, WE'LL

03:24:51.345 --> 03:24:53.781
BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE, MR.

03:24:53.848 --> 03:24:56.684
GONZALES. AND THANK YOU TO THE

03:24:56.751 --> 03:24:57.485
AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS

03:24:57.551 --> 03:24:58.886
FORWARD. WE FACE THIS PROBLEM IN

03:24:58.953 --> 03:25:02.256
LOS ANGELES A LOT, IN A LOT OF

03:25:02.323 --> 03:25:03.691
CORNERS. I'M JUST I'M JUST

03:25:03.758 --> 03:25:04.291
CONCERNED ABOUT A COUPLE OF

03:25:04.358 --> 03:25:05.860
PIECES, BUT I THINK IT'S ALREADY

03:25:05.926 --> 03:25:07.128
BEEN ADDRESSED. BUT IT SAYS

03:25:07.194 --> 03:25:07.928
IMPOSING CRIMINAL PENALTIES ON

03:25:07.995 --> 03:25:09.397
SIDEWALK VENDORS THAT SELL

03:25:09.463 --> 03:25:10.665
SPECIFIC GOODS WITHOUT A PERMIT.

03:25:10.731 --> 03:25:13.234
SO AND THE PROPERTY THAT WOULD

03:25:13.300 --> 03:25:14.435
BE RESTRICTED FROM SELLING WOULD

03:25:14.502 --> 03:25:15.870
BE THE ITEMS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN

03:25:15.936 --> 03:25:17.571
SUBJECT TO RETAIL THEFT. WHAT

03:25:17.638 --> 03:25:18.506
ARE THE ITEMS THAT WE'RE

03:25:18.572 --> 03:25:20.041
REFERENCING? YEAH. SO THE WAY IT

03:25:20.107 --> 03:25:22.677
WILL, FIRST OF ALL, ANYONE WITH

03:25:22.743 --> 03:25:24.412
A PERMIT IS SIMPLY THE BILL

03:25:24.478 --> 03:25:25.746
DOESN'T APPLY TO THEM. SO

03:25:25.813 --> 03:25:28.683
SELLING WITH A PERMIT COMPLETELY

03:25:28.749 --> 03:25:30.951
EXCLUDED FROM THIS BILL, SELLING

03:25:31.018 --> 03:25:32.286
PREPARED FOODS, EXCLUDED FROM

03:25:32.353 --> 03:25:33.954
THE BILL. THE BILL JUST SIMPLY

03:25:34.021 --> 03:25:36.257
DOES NOT APPLY TO PREPARED

03:25:36.323 --> 03:25:40.728
FOODS. WHAT IT DOES APPLY FOR,

03:25:40.795 --> 03:25:42.430
WHAT IT DOES. AND THAT'S EVEN IF

03:25:42.496 --> 03:25:44.565
YOU ARE SELLING PREPARED FOODS

03:25:44.632 --> 03:25:45.900
WITHOUT A PERMIT, IT DOESN'T

03:25:45.966 --> 03:25:46.600
APPLY TO YOU. WHAT THE BILL

03:25:46.667 --> 03:25:48.869
WOULD ALLOW IS FOR THE BOARD OF

03:25:48.936 --> 03:25:51.005
SUPERVISORS TO PREPARE AND ADOPT

03:25:51.072 --> 03:25:54.608
A LIST OF COMMONLY STOLEN GOODS.

03:25:54.675 --> 03:25:57.912
AND THEN IF YOU ARE SELLING THE

03:25:57.978 --> 03:26:00.748
GOODS THAT ARE ON THAT LIST

03:26:00.815 --> 03:26:03.984
WITHOUT A PERMIT, THEN YOU CAN

03:26:04.051 --> 03:26:07.488
BE CITED. AND SO THAT'S THE

03:26:07.555 --> 03:26:08.689
STRUCTURE OF THE BILL. AND IT'S

03:26:08.756 --> 03:26:11.125
IT STARTS OUT AS A WARNING. AND

03:26:11.192 --> 03:26:12.960
THEN IT'S INFRACTION.

03:26:13.027 --> 03:26:14.862
INFRACTION. AND IT'S NOT UNTIL

03:26:14.929 --> 03:26:16.630
THE FOURTH VIOLATION THAT IT

03:26:16.697 --> 03:26:18.733
WOULD BE POTENTIALLY CHARGEABLE

03:26:18.799 --> 03:26:20.568
AS A, AS A MISDEMEANOR. AND

03:26:20.634 --> 03:26:22.269
UNDER CURRENT LAW, WHICH I

03:26:22.336 --> 03:26:25.239
SUPPORTED BACK IN 2018, IT I

03:26:25.306 --> 03:26:27.808
THINK IN GENERAL, IT WAS A GOOD

03:26:27.875 --> 03:26:28.776
THING TO MOVE ENFORCEMENT OF

03:26:28.843 --> 03:26:30.544
STREET VENDING AWAY FROM THE

03:26:30.611 --> 03:26:32.379
POLICE AND TOWARDS

03:26:32.446 --> 03:26:33.881
ADMINISTRATIVE IN THIS LIMITED

03:26:33.948 --> 03:26:35.616
SITUATION. IT'S CREATING SOME

03:26:35.683 --> 03:26:37.451
CHALLENGES. WELL, THE REASON WHY

03:26:37.518 --> 03:26:39.286
I'M ASKING IS BECAUSE IN LOS

03:26:39.353 --> 03:26:40.154
ANGELES, SPECIFICALLY, MACARTHUR

03:26:40.221 --> 03:26:42.757
PARK, FOLKS WILL SELL SHAMPOO.

03:26:42.823 --> 03:26:45.326
PAPER TOWELS LIKELY DON'T HAVE A

03:26:45.392 --> 03:26:47.561
PERMIT. THE PERSON IS LIKELY

03:26:47.628 --> 03:26:48.596
UNDOCUMENTED. SO I'M JUST

03:26:48.662 --> 03:26:50.331
CONCERNED ABOUT THOSE PIECES.

03:26:50.397 --> 03:26:51.732
AND AS IT PERTAINS TO THIS, I

03:26:51.799 --> 03:26:54.201
MEAN, I THINK IT'S A STEP IN THE

03:26:54.268 --> 03:26:55.302
RIGHT DIRECTION. I JUST DON'T

03:26:55.369 --> 03:26:56.370
WANT TO PENALIZE THOSE

OF ALL THE MISDEMEANOR WE CREATE

03:27:03.043 --> 03:27:05.913
IS NOT A DEPORTABLE OFFENSE.

03:27:05.980 --> 03:27:07.782
IT'S NOT A CRIME OF MORAL

03:27:07.848 --> 03:27:09.850
TURPITUDE. AND WE AND IT'S AT

03:27:09.917 --> 03:27:12.353
THE SIX MONTH SIX MONTH

03:27:12.419 --> 03:27:13.521

PEOPLE, BUT TO ACTUALLY CHANGE

03:27:32.339 --> 03:27:34.041
THE ENVIRONMENT. AND THAT'S WHY

03:27:34.108 --> 03:27:35.209
THE STREET VENDOR ASSOCIATION

03:27:35.276 --> 03:27:37.378

BUSINESSES, WITH RESIDENTS, AND

03:28:12.213 --> 03:28:14.648
WITH NEIGHBORHOODS, A SOLUTION

03:28:14.715 --> 03:28:17.785
THAT WILL MAKE AN IMPACT. WE SEE

03:28:17.852 --> 03:28:19.486
SITUATIONS WHERE DIRECTLY IN

03:28:19.553 --> 03:28:21.555
FRONT OF SMALL BUSINESSES, THEY

03:28:21.622 --> 03:28:23.958
ARE HAVING PEOPLE SELL ITEMS

03:28:24.024 --> 03:28:26.460
THAT ARE VERY LIKELY, IN MANY

03:28:26.527 --> 03:28:29.463
CASES, STOLEN. IT IS AN

03:28:29.530 --> 03:28:30.831
UNTENABLE SITUATION FOR SMALL

03:28:35.970 --> 03:28:37.137

03:28:38.572 --> 03:28:41.175
LAWS, PAY TAXES, AND YET THEY

03:28:41.242 --> 03:28:43.110

03:28:43.177 --> 03:28:46.680
COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE AND ALSO

03:28:46.747 --> 03:28:47.781
IMPACTING NEIGHBORHOODS. I THINK

03:28:47.848 --> 03:28:49.650
FROM CHINATOWN TO TENDERLOIN TO

03:28:49.717 --> 03:28:52.419

03:29:08.335 --> 03:29:10.738
THINK WE CAN SUPPORT STREET

03:29:10.804 --> 03:29:12.539
VENDING, WHICH ALSO IS VERY

03:29:12.606 --> 03:29:13.707
IMPORTANT. AND ALSO THESE ARE

03:29:13.774 --> 03:29:15.142
MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY, AND

03:29:15.209 --> 03:29:16.443
MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE

03:29:16.510 --> 03:29:17.978
OPPORTUNITIES TO DO THAT WITH

03:29:18.045 --> 03:29:20.180
PERMITS WITH PARTICULAR TYPES OF

03:41:12.325 --> 03:41:14.327
AGES 6 TO 17 PLACED ON PUBERTY

03:41:14.394 --> 03:41:15.662
BLOCKERS AND HORMONES OVER A

03:41:15.729 --> 03:41:17.631
FIVE YEAR PERIOD MORE THAN

03:41:17.697 --> 03:41:21.835
DOUBLED TO 1400 AND 4200,

03:41:21.901 --> 03:41:23.770
RESPECTIVELY. AND THOSE WHO AND

03:41:23.837 --> 03:41:25.472
THOSE STATS DON'T INCLUDE MY

03:41:25.538 --> 03:41:27.073
PROVIDER, KAISER, THE BIGGEST

03:41:27.140 --> 03:41:29.109
CHOP SHOP ON THE WEST COAST.

03:41:29.175 --> 03:41:30.844
THESE ARE NOT MICROSCOPIC

03:41:30.910 --> 03:41:33.179
NUMBERS. DON'T BLAME MY PARENTS,

03:41:33.246 --> 03:41:34.848
WHO WERE COERCED INTO CONSENTING

03:41:34.914 --> 03:41:36.983
BECAUSE PUBERTY BLOCKERS,

03:41:37.050 --> 03:41:38.018
TESTOSTERONE AND SURGERIES WERE

03:41:38.084 --> 03:41:39.519
THE ONLY TREATMENT OFFERED TO

03:41:39.586 --> 03:41:41.655
ADDRESS MY CUTTING, SUICIDAL

03:41:41.721 --> 03:41:43.223
IDEATION AND INABILITY TO

03:41:43.289 --> 03:41:45.325
FUNCTION. NOT ONE PROVIDER

03:41:45.392 --> 03:41:47.527
EXPLORED MY AUTISTIC TRAITS. NOT

03:41:47.594 --> 03:41:48.862
ONE STEPPED IN TO CONSIDER MY

03:41:48.928 --> 03:41:50.563
CHILDHOOD. SEXUAL ABUSE WAS THE

03:41:50.630 --> 03:41:52.766
REASON I WANTED TO SHED MY

03:41:52.832 --> 03:41:54.267
FEMALE BODY. NOT ONE SAID YOUR

03:41:54.334 --> 03:41:56.069
DAUGHTER IS PERFECT THE WAY SHE

03:41:56.136 --> 03:41:57.804
IS NOW. THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED

03:41:57.871 --> 03:42:00.807
HATEFUL. THIS BILL IS DESIGNED

03:42:00.874 --> 03:42:02.676
TO PROTECT MEDICAL PROVIDERS WHO

03:42:02.742 --> 03:42:04.244
HARMED ME AND ARE HARMING OTHER

03:42:04.310 --> 03:42:06.012
CHILDREN WHO RUN AWAY TO THIS

03:42:06.079 --> 03:42:08.314
STATE UNDER SB 107, OR WHO

03:42:08.381 --> 03:42:09.416
VIOLATE SAFEGUARDING LAWS IN

03:42:09.482 --> 03:42:11.584
THEIR OWN STATES. ALL OF YOU

03:42:11.651 --> 03:42:12.519
SHOULD BE PANICKED AND ASHAMED

03:42:12.585 --> 03:42:16.056
AS YOU SIT IN SILENCE OR LOOK AT

03:42:16.122 --> 03:42:21.227
ME WITH VENOM VÃI KNOW. I AM

03:42:21.294 --> 03:42:23.496
BETH, BORN OF OUR DUTY. MY

03:42:23.563 --> 03:42:25.265
DAUGHTER BELIEVED THAT SHE WAS A

03:42:25.331 --> 03:42:27.400
TRANSGENDER BOY. SHE WAS SO

03:42:27.467 --> 03:42:28.735
ADAMANT THAT SHE CONVINCED A

03:42:28.802 --> 03:42:31.037
COURT TO CHANGE HER NAME AND SEX

03:42:31.104 --> 03:42:32.906
MARKER ON HER BIRTH CERTIFICATE.

03:42:32.972 --> 03:42:34.541
AGAINST MY CHALLENGE, SHE WAS

03:42:34.607 --> 03:42:36.743
15. SHE ALSO BEGGED FOR HORMONES

03:42:36.810 --> 03:42:38.545
AND TO HAVE HER BREAST REMOVED

03:42:38.611 --> 03:42:41.114
AND I REFUSED CONSENT. SHE IS

03:42:41.181 --> 03:42:43.717
NOW 19, NEVER MEDICALIZED, AND

03:42:43.783 --> 03:42:45.719
HAS EMBRACED HER FEMALE BODY.

03:42:45.785 --> 03:42:48.955
SHE WAS NEVER TRANSGENDER. NO

03:42:49.022 --> 03:42:52.258
ONE IS NO ONE. GENDER IDENTITY

03:42:52.325 --> 03:42:55.128
IS A CANARD OR A FALSE BELIEF.

03:42:55.195 --> 03:42:57.263
THIS IS WHY YOU MUST VOTE NO ON

03:42:57.330 --> 03:43:01.267
SB 497. HOW BRAZEN AND FOOLISH

03:43:01.334 --> 03:43:03.336
OF THE SENATOR TO ADMIT IN HIS

03:43:03.403 --> 03:43:05.739
BILL THAT IT IS HIS INTENT TO

03:43:05.805 --> 03:43:06.940
VIOLATE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

03:43:07.006 --> 03:43:08.808
EXECUTIVE ORDERS. HAVEN'T YOU

03:43:08.875 --> 03:43:11.010
BEEN PAYING ATTENTION? PARENTS

03:43:11.077 --> 03:43:14.547
LIKE ME ARE FILLING THE FTC AND

03:43:14.614 --> 03:43:17.016
DOJ TIP LINES WITH EVIDENCE OF

03:43:17.083 --> 03:43:19.285
HOW THIS STATE IS SACRIFICING

03:43:19.352 --> 03:43:21.387
CHILDREN AND VULNERABLE ADULTS

03:43:21.454 --> 03:43:24.657
TO THE TRANSGENDER AGENDA. DO

03:43:24.724 --> 03:43:27.861
YOU REALLY THINK YOUR FORMER

03:43:27.927 --> 03:43:29.929
COLLEAGUE BILL SALLY AND HIS

03:43:29.996 --> 03:43:31.531
BOSS, HARMEET DHILLON, WHO IS

03:43:31.598 --> 03:43:33.299
ALSO MY FORMER ATTORNEY, ARE

03:43:33.366 --> 03:43:34.734
UNAWARE OF YOUR INTENTIONAL

03:43:34.801 --> 03:43:35.835
VIOLATIONS OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS

03:43:35.902 --> 03:43:38.138
AND FEDERAL LAW AND THAT THEY

03:43:38.204 --> 03:43:39.773
WILL NOT STRIKE BACK WITH THE

03:43:39.839 --> 03:43:41.908
FORCE OF THE SUPREME LAW OF THIS

03:43:41.975 --> 03:43:43.510
NATION, WHICH, IN CASE YOU HAVE

03:43:43.576 --> 03:43:45.145
FORGOTTEN, IS THE US

03:43:45.211 --> 03:43:47.347
CONSTITUTION. THE FULL FAITH AND

03:43:47.413 --> 03:43:49.182
CREDIT CLAUSE REQUIRES THAT EACH

03:43:49.249 --> 03:43:51.050
STATE HONOR THE PUBLIC ACTS AND

03:43:51.117 --> 03:43:53.086
JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS OF OTHER

03:43:53.153 --> 03:43:55.121
STATES. THIS IS A CONSTITUTIONAL

03:43:55.188 --> 03:43:56.990
MANDATE THAT HAS HELD OUR UNION

03:43:57.056 --> 03:43:59.492
TOGETHER FOR OVER TWO CENTURIES.

03:43:59.559 --> 03:44:01.995
SB 497 DIRECTLY VIOLATES THIS

03:44:02.061 --> 03:44:03.396
PRINCIPLE BY INTERFERING WITH

03:44:03.463 --> 03:44:05.064
THE LEGITIMATE AUTHORITY OF OUT

03:44:05.131 --> 03:44:06.399
OF STATE COURTS AND OTHER

03:44:06.466 --> 03:44:07.767
GOVERNMENTAL ACTORS TO ACCESS

03:44:07.834 --> 03:44:09.736
RECORDS OF MEDICAL TREATMENTS,

03:44:09.803 --> 03:44:12.772
AS WELL AS TRACK TESTOSTERONE, A

03:44:12.839 --> 03:44:14.340
SCHEDULE THREE DRUG THAT CARRIES

03:44:14.407 --> 03:44:16.442
WITH IT THE RISK OF LIVER

03:44:16.509 --> 03:44:17.544
CANCER, INCREASE HEART ATTACKS,

03:44:17.610 --> 03:44:18.711
INCONTINENCE AND FERTILITY, AND

03:44:18.778 --> 03:44:20.814
A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER LIFELONG

03:44:20.880 --> 03:44:22.916
AILMENTS. FOR WHAT PURPOSE ARE

03:44:22.982 --> 03:44:24.450
YOU PROTECTING THE DRUG

03:44:24.517 --> 03:44:25.852
PRESCRIBERS WHO ARE HARMING

03:44:25.919 --> 03:44:29.489
FEMALE BODIES? VOTE NO ON SB

03:44:29.556 --> 03:44:33.827
497. OKAY, THAT COMPLETES

03:44:33.893 --> 03:44:35.528
OPPOSITION TESTIMONY. OTHER ME

03:44:35.595 --> 03:44:36.996
TO'S COME FORWARD AT THIS TIME.

03:44:37.063 --> 03:44:38.898
PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME, YOUR

03:44:38.965 --> 03:44:39.866
ORGANIZATION AND YOUR POSITION,

03:44:39.933 --> 03:44:42.001
WHICH IS PRESUMABLY TO OPPOSE

03:44:42.068 --> 03:44:44.637
DAVID BULLOCK SERVING FAMILY

03:44:44.704 --> 03:44:45.505
VALUES AND MOMS FOR LIBERTY. WE

03:44:45.572 --> 03:44:48.808
ARE IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU.

03:44:48.875 --> 03:44:51.511
GREG BURT, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE

03:44:51.578 --> 03:44:53.112
CALIFORNIA FAMILY COUNCIL AND

03:44:53.179 --> 03:44:54.347
STRONG OPPOSITION. THANK YOU.

03:44:54.414 --> 03:44:55.582
THANK YOU BOTH. FINAL CALL.

03:44:55.648 --> 03:44:57.917
ANYONE ELSE HOPING TO BE HEARD

03:44:57.984 --> 03:44:58.985
ON THE BILL? OKAY. SEEING NO

03:44:59.052 --> 03:44:59.886
AFFIRMATIVE RESPONSE, WE'RE

03:44:59.953 --> 03:45:02.188
GOING TO TURN IT BACK TO THE

03:45:02.255 --> 03:45:03.189
DAIS NOW FOR QUESTIONS OR

03:45:03.256 --> 03:45:04.290
COMMENTS. DOES ANY MEMBER OF THE

03:45:04.357 --> 03:45:06.259
COMMITTEE HAVE A QUESTION OR A

03:45:06.326 --> 03:45:07.527
COMMENT TO EITHER MR. WIENER OR

03:45:07.594 --> 03:45:09.896
ANY OF THE WITNESSES? MR. HANEY,

03:45:09.963 --> 03:45:12.298
THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR AND THE

03:45:12.365 --> 03:45:14.901
SPONSORS. I THINK IN OUR STATE,

03:45:14.968 --> 03:45:18.104
WHEN PEOPLE ACCESS HEALTH CARE,

03:45:18.171 --> 03:45:19.439
WHATEVER THAT IS, THEY THEY

03:45:19.505 --> 03:45:21.741
EXPECT THAT TO BE BETWEEN THEM

03:45:21.808 --> 03:45:24.444
AND THEIR DOCTOR. AND

03:45:24.510 --> 03:45:25.578
UNFORTUNATELY AND TRAGICALLY,

03:45:25.645 --> 03:45:28.147
WHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW ARE

03:45:28.214 --> 03:45:30.016
PEOPLE BEING CRIMINALIZED FOR

03:45:30.083 --> 03:45:32.118
SEEKING CERTAIN TYPES OF CARE OR

03:45:32.185 --> 03:45:34.287
FOR PROVIDING THAT CARE. AND WE

03:45:34.354 --> 03:45:35.421
SHOULDN'T BE IN THIS PLACE WHERE

03:45:35.488 --> 03:45:37.190
WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO TAKE

03:45:37.257 --> 03:45:39.325
ADDITIONAL MEASURES TO PROTECT

03:45:39.392 --> 03:45:40.760
PEOPLE'S DATA. EVERY SINGLE ONE

03:45:40.827 --> 03:45:42.161
OF US, WHETHER IT'S GENDER

03:45:42.228 --> 03:45:43.096
AFFIRMING CARE, WHETHER IT'S

03:45:43.162 --> 03:45:44.664
WHETHER IT'S ANY CARE THAT WE

03:45:44.731 --> 03:45:46.499
GET WHATEVER IS PRESCRIBED TO

03:45:46.566 --> 03:45:48.635
US, WE DON'T EXPECT THAT TO BE

03:45:48.701 --> 03:45:51.905
MADE AVAILABLE TO SOMEONE WHO

03:45:51.971 --> 03:45:53.673
WANTS TO CREATE A LAW THAT

03:45:53.740 --> 03:45:54.941
CRIMINALIZES US OR OUR DOCTORS.

03:45:55.008 --> 03:45:56.109
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT

03:45:56.175 --> 03:46:00.179
NOW. AND IT'S TERRIFYING. AND

03:46:00.246 --> 03:46:01.147
FOR CALIFORNIA TO NOT HAVE

03:46:01.214 --> 03:46:03.416
ADEQUATE PROTECTIONS RIGHT NOW

03:46:03.483 --> 03:46:05.285
TO ENSURE THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE

03:46:05.351 --> 03:46:07.120
ACCESSING THAT CARE, WHEN THEY

03:46:07.186 --> 03:46:07.820
ARE GETTING THAT TREATMENT, THEY

03:46:07.887 --> 03:46:09.889
KNOW THAT IT'S PROTECTED, I

03:46:09.956 --> 03:46:11.591
THINK IS DANGEROUS IN THIS

03:46:11.658 --> 03:46:13.693
CLIMATE. AND SO I APPRECIATE THE

03:46:13.760 --> 03:46:15.595
LEADERSHIP IN COMING FORWARD AND

03:46:15.662 --> 03:46:17.830
MAKING SURE THAT IF THERE'S A

03:46:17.897 --> 03:46:18.831
COURT ORDER, IF THERE'S A

03:46:18.898 --> 03:46:20.466
SUBPOENA, THAT'S A DIFFERENT

03:46:20.533 --> 03:46:21.434
SITUATION. BUT SHARING THIS TYPE

03:46:21.501 --> 03:46:23.603
OF INFORMATION THAT CAN PUT

03:46:23.670 --> 03:46:25.405
PEOPLE AT RISK, THAT CAN

03:46:25.471 --> 03:46:26.506
CRIMINALIZE THEM SIMPLY FOR

03:46:26.572 --> 03:46:28.074
DOING THEIR JOB OR RECEIVING

03:46:28.141 --> 03:46:30.376
TREATMENT, I THINK IS INCREDIBLY

03:46:30.443 --> 03:46:32.512
DANGEROUS, AND ESPECIALLY RIGHT

03:46:32.578 --> 03:46:35.682
NOW AS IT RELATES TO PROTECTING

03:46:35.748 --> 03:46:38.584
TRANS PEOPLE, GENDER

03:46:38.651 --> 03:46:39.852
NONCONFORMING PEOPLE WHO ARE

03:46:39.919 --> 03:46:41.955
RECEIVING CARE. THIS IS

03:46:42.021 --> 03:46:42.588
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT PROTECTION.

03:46:42.655 --> 03:46:44.924
AND I'LL MOVE THE BILL. ALL

03:46:44.991 --> 03:46:45.725
RIGHT. BEFORE WE PROCEED, WE

03:46:45.792 --> 03:46:47.627
HAVE A MOTION. IS THERE A

03:46:47.694 --> 03:46:48.795
SECOND? WE HAVE A SECOND. BY

03:46:48.861 --> 03:46:50.563
NGUYEN. LET'S CONTINUE. OTHER

03:46:50.630 --> 03:46:51.397
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM

03:46:51.464 --> 03:46:54.467
COMMITTEE MEMBERS SEEING NONE.

03:46:54.534 --> 03:46:55.702
SENATOR WIENER, WOULD YOU LIKE

03:47:03.543 --> 03:47:07.513
EXTENSIVELY ABOUT THE FASCISM

03:47:07.580 --> 03:47:08.982
ARISING IN THIS COUNTRY AND WHAT

03:47:09.048 --> 03:47:11.684
IT'S DOING IN TERMS OF ATTACKING

03:47:11.751 --> 03:47:13.886
AND TEARING APART IMMIGRANT

03:47:13.953 --> 03:47:16.022
COMMUNITIES. AND WE HAVE, AT THE

03:47:16.089 --> 03:47:18.391
SAME TIME, A BROAD BASED ATTACK

03:47:18.458 --> 03:47:20.126
ON THE VERY EXISTENCE OF

03:47:20.193 --> 03:47:22.662
TRANSGENDER PEOPLE. THIS BILL IS

03:47:22.729 --> 03:47:24.297
ABOUT CALIFORNIA STEPPING UP TO

03:47:24.364 --> 03:47:25.965
PROTECT THESE MEMBERS OF OUR

03:47:26.032 --> 03:47:27.166
COMMUNITY. AND I RESPECTFULLY

03:47:27.233 --> 03:47:28.768
ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. WELL, THANK

TALKING ALL DAY ABOUT

03:47:36.042 --> 03:47:36.542
ACCOUNTABILITY. SO LET ME BE

03:47:36.609 --> 03:47:38.544
CLEAR. MY NAME IS NICK SCHULTZ.

03:47:38.611 --> 03:47:40.313

03:48:08.875 --> 03:48:09.642
YOU, SENATOR. THANK YOU TO ALL

03:48:09.709 --> 03:48:12.278
OF OUR WITNESSES TODAY. THIS

03:48:12.345 --> 03:48:13.679
WILL PROBABLY BE OUR LAST ITEM

03:48:13.746 --> 03:48:15.848
BEFORE THE LUNCH BREAK. WE HAVE

03:48:15.915 --> 03:48:20.353
SENATE BILL FOUR. MARK. PARDON

03:48:20.420 --> 03:48:25.992
ME ONE MOMENT. SO, SENATOR

03:48:26.059 --> 03:48:27.293
RUBIO, WE PROBABLY ONLY HAVE

03:48:27.360 --> 03:48:28.895
TIME FOR ONE ITEM BEFORE LUNCH.

03:48:28.961 --> 03:48:30.430
WHICH BILL WOULD YOU LIKE TO

03:48:30.496 --> 03:48:32.765
START WITH? SB 680. OKAY,

03:48:32.832 --> 03:48:34.667
COLLEAGUES, THIS IS ITEM NUMBER

03:48:34.734 --> 03:48:36.803
18, SENATE BILL 680. SENATOR

03:48:36.869 --> 03:48:39.972
RUBIO, THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK

03:48:40.039 --> 03:48:42.175
YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY

03:48:42.241 --> 03:48:44.243
TO PRESENT BEFORE YOU TODAY. I'M

03:48:44.310 --> 03:48:47.947
HONORED TO PRESENT SB 680, WHICH

03:48:48.014 --> 03:48:49.048
STRENGTHENS CALIFORNIA'S SEX

03:48:49.115 --> 03:48:50.883
OFFENDER REGISTRATION LAWS TO

03:48:50.950 --> 03:48:52.518
BETTER PROTECT OUR GIRLS HERE IN

03:48:52.585 --> 03:48:55.388
OUR STATE, AND ESPECIALLY FROM

03:48:55.455 --> 03:48:56.989
EXPLOITATION. LET'S BE CLEAR

03:48:57.056 --> 03:48:59.158
THIS BILL DOES NOTHING MORE THAN

03:48:59.225 --> 03:49:01.027
PROTECT OUR DAUGHTERS, OUR

03:49:01.094 --> 03:49:02.428
NIECES, AND OUR UNDERAGE GIRLS

03:49:02.495 --> 03:49:04.630
HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

03:49:04.697 --> 03:49:05.565
WHO ARE LEFT BEHIND. UNDER

03:49:05.631 --> 03:49:07.433
CURRENT STATE LAW, CALIFORNIA

03:49:07.500 --> 03:49:09.869
LAW SENDS A TROUBLING MESSAGE IT

03:49:09.936 --> 03:49:11.471
REQUIRES SEX OFFENDERS TO

03:49:11.537 --> 03:49:13.539
REGISTER FOR SEX ACTS WITH A

03:49:13.606 --> 03:49:15.141
MINOR. HOWEVER, OUR YOUNG LADIES

03:49:15.208 --> 03:49:18.144
ARE LEFT OUT. SB 680 WILL CLOSE

03:49:18.211 --> 03:49:19.545
THIS SIGNIFICANT LOOPHOLE IN

03:49:19.612 --> 03:49:21.114
CALIFORNIA SEX OFFENDER

03:49:21.180 --> 03:49:22.448
REGISTRATION LAWS, AND I'LL TURN

03:49:22.515 --> 03:49:25.051
IT OVER EVENTUALLY TO MY WITNESS

03:49:25.118 --> 03:49:26.853
TO EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE. UNDER

03:49:26.919 --> 03:49:28.387
CURRENT LAW, IF AN ADULT IS MORE

03:49:28.454 --> 03:49:30.156
THAN TEN YEARS OLDER THAN A

03:49:30.223 --> 03:49:32.558
MINOR AND ENGAGES IN SEXUAL

03:49:32.625 --> 03:49:33.993
ACTS, THEY'RE AUTOMATICALLY

03:49:34.060 --> 03:49:36.329
REQUIRED TO REGISTER A TIER ONE

03:49:36.395 --> 03:49:39.165
SEX OFFENDERS REGISTRY. THAT IS

03:49:39.232 --> 03:49:40.600
THE LAW RIGHT NOW. SO WE'RE NOT

03:49:40.666 --> 03:49:42.401
TRYING TO CHANGE THE LAW. WE'RE

03:49:42.468 --> 03:49:43.703
JUST TRYING TO PROTECT OUR GIRLS

03:49:43.769 --> 03:49:45.138
WHO THROUGH LANGUAGE HAVE BEEN

03:49:45.204 --> 03:49:48.374
LEFT OUT OF THIS, THIS EQUATION,

03:49:48.441 --> 03:49:51.077
THIS INCONSISTENCY DOES NOT MAKE

03:49:51.144 --> 03:49:52.912
SENSE TO LEAVE YOUNG GIRLS OUT.

03:49:52.979 --> 03:49:54.113
THEY ALSO DESERVE THE FULL

03:49:54.180 --> 03:49:55.581
PROTECTION OF THE LAW. THIS IS

03:49:55.648 --> 03:49:58.017
ABOUT PROTECTING THE GIRLS AND

03:49:58.084 --> 03:49:59.619
MAKING SURE THAT WE HOLD

03:49:59.685 --> 03:50:00.586
ACCOUNTABLE THE REPEAT OFFENDERS

03:50:00.653 --> 03:50:02.455
THAT CONTINUE TO GO BACK TO

03:50:02.522 --> 03:50:04.891
VIOLATE OUR YOUNG LADIES AGAIN.

03:50:04.957 --> 03:50:06.659
THIS LAW IS ALREADY IN PLACE,

03:50:06.726 --> 03:50:09.262
BUT I'M SO UPSET THAT DOESN'T

03:50:09.328 --> 03:50:11.097
INCLUDE YOUNG LADIES. AND TODAY

03:50:11.164 --> 03:50:13.566
WITH ME, I HAVE HEIDI FELDSTEIN

03:50:13.633 --> 03:50:16.068
SOTO, THE 43RD LOS ANGELES CITY

03:50:16.135 --> 03:50:17.970
ATTORNEY, AND TARA HILLARD,

03:50:18.037 --> 03:50:19.705
PRESIDENT AND CEO OF FORGOTTEN

03:50:19.772 --> 03:50:21.674
CHILDREN, WHO WILL FURTHER

03:50:21.741 --> 03:50:22.542
EXPLAIN THIS DEFICIENCY. THANK

03:50:22.608 --> 03:50:26.646
YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD

03:50:26.712 --> 03:50:27.580
MORNING STILL. THANK YOU SO

03:50:27.647 --> 03:50:30.183
MUCH, CHAIR SCHULTZ. AND TO THE

03:50:30.249 --> 03:50:30.850
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR

03:50:30.917 --> 03:50:32.351
HEARING US. MY NAME IS HEIDI

03:50:32.418 --> 03:50:33.920
FELDSTEIN SOTO. I AM THE CITY

03:50:33.986 --> 03:50:35.588
ATTORNEY FOR THE CITY OF LOS

03:50:35.655 --> 03:50:37.657
ANGELES. I WILL GIVE YOU A

03:50:37.723 --> 03:50:38.891
LITTLE BRIEF HISTORY. THIS BILL

03:50:38.958 --> 03:50:41.294
LAST YEAR PASSED OUT OF THE

03:50:41.360 --> 03:50:43.496
SENATE, OVERWHELMINGLY CAME TO

03:50:43.563 --> 03:50:45.231
THIS HOUSE, PASSED OUT OF BOTH

03:50:45.298 --> 03:50:47.533
COMMITTEES IN THIS HOUSE, AND

03:50:47.600 --> 03:50:49.535
WAS HELD UP IN APPROPRIATIONS.

03:50:49.602 --> 03:50:51.537
SO IT NEVER MADE IT TO THE

03:50:51.604 --> 03:50:52.605
SENATE FLOOR. THE ONLY ELEMENT

03:50:52.672 --> 03:50:54.407
OF THE BILL THAT INVOLVED

03:50:54.473 --> 03:50:55.374
APPROPRIATIONS LAST YEAR WAS

03:50:55.441 --> 03:50:56.676
THAT THERE WAS A CONCERN THAT

03:50:56.742 --> 03:50:58.477
THE WAY THE BILL WAS DRAFTED, IT

03:50:58.544 --> 03:51:00.813
WOULD BE RETROACTIVE TO THE

03:51:00.880 --> 03:51:02.181
ORIGINS OF THE SEX OFFENDERS

03:51:02.248 --> 03:51:03.282
REGISTRY. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IT

03:51:03.349 --> 03:51:05.418
WOULD PICK UP A WHOLE LOT OF NEW

03:51:05.484 --> 03:51:07.420
OFFENDERS. SENATOR RUBIO TOOK AN

03:51:07.486 --> 03:51:08.387
AMENDMENT TO ELIMINATE THAT. IT

03:51:08.454 --> 03:51:10.389
IS CLEAR THAT THERE IS NO

03:51:10.456 --> 03:51:12.058
RETROACTIVE EFFECT, AND THERE

03:51:12.124 --> 03:51:14.493
SHOULD BE MINIMAL TO NO FISCAL

03:51:14.560 --> 03:51:16.596
IMPACT GOING FORWARD. UNDER

03:51:16.662 --> 03:51:20.433
CURRENT LAW, EVERY SEX OFFENSE

03:51:20.499 --> 03:51:23.402
AGAINST ANY MINOR, IF THE

03:51:23.469 --> 03:51:25.304
PERPETRATOR IS AT LEAST TEN

03:51:25.371 --> 03:51:27.840
YEARS OLDER THAN THE MINOR, IS

03:51:27.907 --> 03:51:28.774
AUTOMATICALLY REGISTERED AS A

03:51:28.841 --> 03:51:31.244
TIER ONE REGISTRY. EVERY SINGLE

03:51:31.310 --> 03:51:35.381
ONE, SAVE ONE UNLAWFUL STATUTE.

03:51:35.448 --> 03:51:36.782
UNLAWFUL SEXUAL INTERCOURSE,

03:51:36.849 --> 03:51:39.285
ALSO KNOWN AS STATUTORY RAPE.

03:51:39.352 --> 03:51:40.686
ALSO, I'VE HEARD IT CALLED

03:51:40.753 --> 03:51:42.355
PENILE VAGINAL INTERCOURSE. SO

03:51:42.421 --> 03:51:46.125
IF YOU'RE 14 TO 17 AS A FEMALE

03:51:46.192 --> 03:51:48.928
MINOR AND YOU ARE ABUSED BY

03:51:48.995 --> 03:51:50.329
SOMEONE AT LEAST TEN YEARS OLDER

03:51:50.396 --> 03:51:53.232
THAN YOU, THEY ARE NOT

03:51:53.299 --> 03:51:54.967
AUTOMATICALLY REGISTRABLE. THIS

03:51:55.034 --> 03:51:56.969
HAS GROWN OUT OF OUR WORK. MY

03:51:57.036 --> 03:51:58.738
OFFICE'S WORK ALONG THE FIGUEROA

03:51:58.804 --> 03:52:00.606
CORRIDOR. WE HAVE WORKED

03:52:00.673 --> 03:52:01.607
EXTENSIVELY, AND I DO WANT TO

03:52:01.674 --> 03:52:03.843
LET MISS HILLYARD SPEAK TO YOU

03:52:03.909 --> 03:52:05.578
DIRECTLY, BECAUSE SHE HAS LIFE

03:52:05.645 --> 03:52:06.679
EXPERIENCE AND WORKS WITH THESE

03:52:06.746 --> 03:52:09.515
GIRLS DIRECTLY, BUT WE ARE

03:52:09.582 --> 03:52:11.484
SENDING A MESSAGE TO OUR TEENAGE

03:52:11.550 --> 03:52:15.988
GIRLS THAT SOMEHOW IT IS OKAY

03:52:16.055 --> 03:52:17.757
FOR THEM TO BE ABUSED, AND THAT

03:52:17.823 --> 03:52:20.259
THAT PERSON WHO IS AT LEAST TEN

03:52:20.326 --> 03:52:23.229
YEARS OLDER THAN THEM, IS

03:52:23.296 --> 03:52:25.031
SOMEHOW NOT A REGISTRABLE

03:52:25.097 --> 03:52:26.799
OFFENDER. I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO

03:52:26.866 --> 03:52:28.567
FIX THIS AS A LOOPHOLE IN THE

03:52:28.634 --> 03:52:31.170
LAW FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS NOW,

03:52:31.237 --> 03:52:34.006
AND I DO VIEW IT AS A TECHNICAL

03:52:34.073 --> 03:52:35.808
CORRECTION. THERE IS NOTHING, NO

03:52:35.875 --> 03:52:37.343
NEW CRIME BEING CREATED. THERE

03:52:37.410 --> 03:52:40.112
IS NO EXTENSION OF ANY SENTENCE.

03:52:40.179 --> 03:52:41.847
IF YOU ENGAGE IN ORAL SEX,

03:52:41.914 --> 03:52:43.115
YOU'RE AUTOMATICALLY REGISTERED.

03:52:43.182 --> 03:52:45.484
IF YOU ENGAGE IN SEX, YOU'RE

03:52:45.551 --> 03:52:48.020
AUTOMATICALLY REGISTERED. MY

03:52:48.087 --> 03:52:49.021
PERSPECTIVE WOULD BE IF YOU

03:52:49.088 --> 03:52:52.992
ENGAGE IN. THE MISSIONARY

03:52:53.059 --> 03:52:53.793
POSITION, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO

03:52:53.859 --> 03:52:55.528
CALL IT. PENAL VAGINAL

03:52:55.594 --> 03:52:56.929
INTERCOURSE. YOU OUGHT TO BE

03:52:56.996 --> 03:52:58.497
AUTOMATICALLY REGISTERED TO THE

03:52:58.564 --> 03:53:00.099
SAME EXTENT AS EVERYBODY ELSE.

03:53:00.166 --> 03:53:01.233
IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE SEX

03:53:01.300 --> 03:53:03.502
OFFENDERS REGISTRY, REPEAL IT.

03:53:03.569 --> 03:53:06.272
BUT AS LONG AS IT IS THE LAW OF

03:53:06.339 --> 03:53:08.641
THIS STATE, IT OUGHT TO APPLY

03:53:08.708 --> 03:53:09.508
WITH EQUAL FORCE TO ALL OF OUR

03:53:09.575 --> 03:53:11.911
MINORS. THANK YOU. HI, MY NAME

03:53:11.977 --> 03:53:13.879
IS TARA HILLIARD AND I AM THE

03:53:13.946 --> 03:53:15.781
CEO OF FORGOTTEN CHILDREN, INC.

03:53:15.848 --> 03:53:17.483
WE ARE AN ANTI-TRAFFICKING

03:53:17.550 --> 03:53:19.085
ORGANIZATION BASED OUT OF LONG

03:53:19.151 --> 03:53:20.886
BEACH WITH A SAFE HOUSE IN SAN

03:53:20.953 --> 03:53:23.689
BERNARDINO. SO IT'S GREAT TO BE

03:53:23.756 --> 03:53:25.524
HERE TODAY. I COME FIRST WITH MY

03:53:25.591 --> 03:53:27.660
OWN PERSONAL TESTIMONY. I WAS 16

03:53:27.727 --> 03:53:29.428
YEARS OLD WHEN I WAS ENGAGED IN

03:53:29.495 --> 03:53:32.298
A UNHEALTHY RELATIONSHIP WITH A

03:53:32.365 --> 03:53:34.734
GENTLEMAN THAT WAS 25 YEARS OLD.

03:53:34.800 --> 03:53:37.303
LATER ON FOUND OUT HE WAS 26. AT

03:53:37.370 --> 03:53:39.505
THAT TIME, I HAD NO IDEA THAT

03:53:39.572 --> 03:53:42.007
THE RELATIONSHIP I WAS IN WAS

03:53:42.074 --> 03:53:43.175
UNHEALTHY AND THAT HE WAS A

03:53:43.242 --> 03:53:44.610
PREDATOR. UNFORTUNATELY, JUST

03:53:44.677 --> 03:53:46.178
LIKE MANY PREDATORS, HE PREYED

03:53:46.245 --> 03:53:48.514
ON MY VULNERABILITIES OF BEING A

03:53:48.581 --> 03:53:49.915
SURVIVOR OF CHILD SEXUAL

03:53:49.982 --> 03:53:51.751
EXPLOITATION AND ASSAULT. AND

03:53:51.817 --> 03:53:53.886
SO, YOU KNOW, I RESIDE IN SOUTH

03:53:53.953 --> 03:53:55.788
LA, GREW UP THERE. AND WHAT I'VE

03:53:55.855 --> 03:53:57.156
LEARNED IS THAT PREDATORS LOVE

03:53:57.223 --> 03:53:59.058
TO GO INTO VULNERABLE

03:53:59.125 --> 03:54:00.025
COMMUNITIES LOOKING FOR

03:54:00.092 --> 03:54:01.727
VULNERABLE YOUNG WOMEN. IN FACT,

03:54:01.794 --> 03:54:03.629
THAT IS THE ISSUE OF HUMAN

03:54:03.696 --> 03:54:05.131
TRAFFICKING. WHY I DECIDED THAT

03:54:05.197 --> 03:54:06.699
I WAS GOING TO TURN MY TRAUMA

03:54:06.766 --> 03:54:08.401
INTO SOMETHING THAT WAS MORE

03:54:08.467 --> 03:54:09.802
VICTORIOUS. AND SO I FIGHT FOR

03:54:09.869 --> 03:54:11.504
YOUNG WOMEN WHO DON'T HAVE A

03:54:11.570 --> 03:54:13.372
VOICE. AND I BELIEVE THAT WHEN

03:54:13.439 --> 03:54:15.508
THERE IS AN ABSENCE OF LAWS OR

03:54:15.574 --> 03:54:16.108
ACCOUNTABILITY, THEN PREDATORS

03:54:16.175 --> 03:54:18.377
CAN PREY AS MUCH AS THEY WANT

03:54:18.444 --> 03:54:20.513
TO. THERE IS NO LAW, THERE IS NO

03:54:20.579 --> 03:54:21.947
ACCOUNTABILITY, AND VICTIMS ARE

03:54:22.014 --> 03:54:23.516
FORCED TO HAVE TO LIVE WITH THIS

03:54:23.582 --> 03:54:25.117
EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND SO MY

03:54:25.184 --> 03:54:27.653
PRAYER IS THAT MORE YOUNG WOMEN

03:54:27.720 --> 03:54:30.189
LIKE MYSELF, WHO WERE VICTIMS OR

03:54:30.256 --> 03:54:32.425
VULNERABLE AT THE TIME, NOW HAVE

03:54:32.491 --> 03:54:34.360
A WAY THAT THEY CAN STAND UP

03:54:34.427 --> 03:54:35.728
BECAUSE THERE ARE LAWS THAT WILL

03:54:35.795 --> 03:54:37.563
PROTECT THEM. I BELIEVE IF A

03:54:37.630 --> 03:54:38.697
PREDATOR KNOWS HE HAS TO

03:54:38.764 --> 03:54:39.698
REGISTER, THEN MAYBE THAT WILL

03:54:39.765 --> 03:54:42.134
CURTAIL SOME OF HIS ACTIVITY. IF

03:54:42.201 --> 03:54:43.302
NOT, THEN MAYBE IT WILL GIVE THE

03:54:43.369 --> 03:54:45.337
YOUNG WOMAN A VOICE TO SPEAK UP

03:54:45.404 --> 03:54:46.672
AND SPEAK OUT AND BECOME BOLD

03:54:46.739 --> 03:54:48.741
AND COURAGEOUS. AND SO I STAND

03:54:48.808 --> 03:54:50.476
HERE TODAY AS A VOICE FOR THOSE

03:54:50.543 --> 03:54:52.578
WHO DON'T HAVE THE VOICE. WE SEE

03:54:52.645 --> 03:54:53.446
YOUNG WOMEN EVERY DAY BETWEEN

03:54:53.512 --> 03:54:56.482
THE AGES OF 18 AND 27, PREYED

03:54:56.549 --> 03:54:58.784
UPON BY OLDER MEN WHO FEEL LIKE

03:54:58.851 --> 03:55:00.586
THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO THEIR

OPPOSITION TO SB 680. THERE ARE

03:56:52.898 --> 03:56:55.434
VERY MANY MOVING STORIES ON BOTH

03:56:55.501 --> 03:56:58.170
SIDES OF THE ISSUES IN THESE

03:56:58.237 --> 03:57:01.173
KINDS OF BILLS, AND I THANK YOU

GOING TO BE TECHNICAL. SB 680

03:57:07.346 --> 03:57:08.981
WOULD DO THE FOLLOWING. IT WOULD

03:57:09.048 --> 03:57:12.551
UNDERMINE THE EVIDENCE BASED

03:57:12.618 --> 03:57:14.853
2017 SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY

03:57:14.920 --> 03:57:17.356
REFORM ACT, WHICH PURPOSEFULLY

03:57:17.423 --> 03:57:19.058
ELIMINATED THE THEN EXISTING

03:57:19.124 --> 03:57:21.293
OVERBROAD REGISTRATION

03:57:21.360 --> 03:57:22.561
REQUIREMENTS, THEREBY

03:57:22.628 --> 03:57:24.496
UNDERMINING THE CONSIDERABLE

03:57:24.563 --> 03:57:26.532
PROGRESS CALIFORNIA HAS MADE IN

03:57:26.599 --> 03:57:29.134
CATCHING UP WITH THE REST OF THE

03:57:29.201 --> 03:57:31.103
STATES AND THE FEDERAL

03:57:31.170 --> 03:57:36.442
GOVERNMENT. IN IN ITS APPROACH

03:57:36.508 --> 03:57:38.911
TO SEX OFFENDER REGISTRATION, IT

03:57:38.978 --> 03:57:40.679
WOULD CREATE COLLATERAL IMPACTS

03:57:40.746 --> 03:57:42.815
ON FAMILIES, CHILDREN, AND

03:57:42.881 --> 03:57:44.617
COMMUNITIES OF NON-DANGEROUS

03:57:44.683 --> 03:57:46.518
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO

03:57:46.585 --> 03:57:48.954
REGISTER IT WOULD ENSNARE

03:57:49.021 --> 03:57:51.023
OTHERWISE LAW ABIDING

03:57:51.090 --> 03:57:53.058

OHIO, WHERE THE AGE OF CONSENT

03:58:01.266 --> 03:58:04.436
IS 16 YEARS OLD. IT WOULD CREATE

03:58:04.503 --> 03:58:06.672
CRIMES OF MORAL TURPITUDE BY

03:58:06.739 --> 03:58:08.374
REQUIRING THE TEN YEAR

03:58:08.440 --> 03:58:10.209
REGISTRATION FOR PENAL CODE

03:58:10.275 --> 03:58:13.846

LEADING UNDER FEDERAL LAW TO

03:58:16.148 --> 03:58:18.117
DEPORTATION. IN OTHER WORDS, BY

03:58:18.183 --> 03:58:20.653
REQUIRING A NON-CITIZEN 21 YEAR

WITH THEIR 17 YEAR OLD LOVED ONE

03:58:25.624 --> 03:58:27.626
TO REGISTER AS A SEX OFFENDER

03:58:27.693 --> 03:58:28.727
FOR TEN YEARS, THIS BILL WOULD

03:58:28.794 --> 03:58:30.596
BE DEEMED A CRIME OF MORAL

03:58:30.663 --> 03:58:33.232
TURPITUDE AND LEAD TO LIKELY

03:58:33.298 --> 03:58:35.034
DEPORTATION. IN THESE DAYS.

03:58:35.100 --> 03:58:38.037
DEFINITE DEPORTATION. THIS BILL

03:58:38.103 --> 03:58:39.772
WOULD ENACT A REGISTRATION

03:58:39.838 --> 03:58:41.507
REQUIREMENT THAT IS UNNECESSARY

03:58:41.573 --> 03:58:44.043
AND REDUNDANT, SINCE A JUDGE CAN

03:58:44.109 --> 03:58:47.713
ORDER ANYONE CONVICTED OF ANY

03:58:47.780 --> 03:58:49.615

ASSAULT TO REGISTER. FOR THESE

03:59:12.504 --> 03:59:14.473
REASONS, WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST

03:59:14.540 --> 03:59:17.543
YOUR NO VOTE. STILL. MORNING.

03:59:17.609 --> 03:59:19.712
RIGHT. GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS

03:59:19.778 --> 03:59:21.146
ELIZABETH KIM. I'M THE POLICY

03:59:21.213 --> 03:59:23.348
DIRECTOR AT INITIATE JUSTICE. I

03:59:23.415 --> 03:59:25.551
COME TO THIS WORK AS A LAWYER, A

03:59:25.617 --> 03:59:27.252
FORMER POLICY STAFFER AT THE

03:59:27.319 --> 03:59:29.388
DOJ, AND AN EDUCATOR WHO HAS

03:59:29.455 --> 03:59:31.123
TAUGHT CIVIC ENGAGEMENT INSIDE

03:59:31.190 --> 03:59:33.459
LEVEL THREE AND FOUR PRISONS. I

03:59:33.525 --> 03:59:34.893
WORK DIRECTLY WITH PEOPLE

03:59:34.960 --> 03:59:36.061
IMPACTED BY THE JUSTICE SYSTEM,

03:59:36.128 --> 03:59:37.663
BOTH ON THE LAW ENFORCEMENT SIDE

03:59:37.730 --> 03:59:39.465
AS WELL AS PEOPLE WHO ARE

03:59:39.531 --> 03:59:42.101
IMPACTED. AND I'M HERE TODAY TO

03:59:42.167 --> 03:59:43.769
RESPECTFULLY URGE A NO VOTE ON

03:59:43.836 --> 03:59:46.371
SB 680. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO

03:59:46.438 --> 03:59:50.008
FOCUS ON TODAY IS THAT A COUPLE

03:59:50.075 --> 03:59:52.044
THINGS. MY COLLEAGUE HAS ALREADY

03:59:52.111 --> 03:59:53.378
ADDRESSED THE LEGAL OVERREACH

03:59:53.445 --> 03:59:55.280
AND THE IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES

03:59:55.347 --> 03:59:57.616
OF THIS BILL. AND WHAT I'D LIKE

03:59:57.683 --> 03:59:59.318
TO FOCUS ON IS THE PUBLIC

03:59:59.384 --> 04:00:00.385
SAFETY, THE REENTRY AND THE

04:00:00.452 --> 04:00:02.821
SYSTEM CAPACITY, BECAUSE THESE

04:00:02.888 --> 04:00:05.858
IMPACTS ARE REAL AND MEASURABLE.

04:00:05.924 --> 04:00:07.259
ALTHOUGH WE APPRECIATE THAT IT

04:00:07.326 --> 04:00:08.727
DOESN'T WORK RETROACTIVELY,

04:00:08.794 --> 04:00:10.162
WHICH WE APPRECIATE IN THE

04:00:10.229 --> 04:00:11.630
AMENDMENTS, THIS BILL WON'T MAKE

04:00:11.697 --> 04:00:13.899
US SAFER. THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE

04:00:13.966 --> 04:00:16.268
OF JUSTICE AND BUREAU OF JUSTICE

04:00:16.335 --> 04:00:18.337
STATISTICS HAVE CONSISTENTLY

04:00:18.403 --> 04:00:19.505
FOUND THAT INCREASING THE

04:00:19.571 --> 04:00:22.241
SEVERITY OF PUNISHMENT OR

04:00:22.307 --> 04:00:24.109
REGISTRY DOES NOT REDUCE CRIME

04:00:24.176 --> 04:00:26.678
OR PREVENT THE CRIME. SO WHAT

04:00:26.745 --> 04:00:30.282
WE'RE SAYING IS THE JUDICIAL

04:00:30.349 --> 04:00:31.784
DISCRETION EXISTS. THE PENAL

04:00:31.850 --> 04:00:35.387
CODE, SECTION 290 .006 ALREADY

04:00:35.454 --> 04:00:37.422
ALLOWS JUDGES TO REQUIRE THAT

04:00:37.489 --> 04:00:38.557
REGISTRATION WHEN SOMEONE POSES

04:00:38.624 --> 04:00:41.093
A RISK, AND THAT DISCRETION

04:00:41.160 --> 04:00:43.262
MATTERS. SO IT ALLOWS COURTS TO

04:00:43.328 --> 04:00:44.329
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN DANGEROUS

04:00:44.396 --> 04:00:45.664
CONDUCT AND CASES WHERE

04:00:45.731 --> 04:00:47.366
REGISTRATION IS EITHER NECESSARY

04:00:47.432 --> 04:00:49.768
OR PROPORTIONATE, AND REMOVING

04:00:49.835 --> 04:00:51.103
REMOVING THAT FLEXIBILITY

04:00:51.170 --> 04:00:52.371
UNDERMINES BOTH PUBLIC SAFETY

04:00:52.437 --> 04:00:55.107
AND FAIRNESS. AND WE ALSO ARE

04:00:55.174 --> 04:00:57.309
CONCERNED ABOUT THE CAPACITY. I

04:00:57.376 --> 04:00:59.511
KNOW THAT YOU SAID THAT THERE'S

04:00:59.578 --> 04:01:01.213
ZERO FISCAL IMPACT. THE

04:01:01.280 --> 04:01:02.648
CALIFORNIA DOJ HAS WARNED THAT

04:01:02.714 --> 04:01:04.183
EXPANDING THE REGISTRY IN THIS

04:01:04.249 --> 04:01:05.918
WAY WOULD OVERWHELM AN ALREADY

04:01:05.984 --> 04:01:07.452
STRAINED SYSTEM AND PULL

04:01:07.519 --> 04:01:10.455
RESOURCES AWAY FROM HIGHER

04:01:10.522 --> 04:01:12.558
PRIORITY HARM, AND THE

04:01:12.624 --> 04:01:14.493
COMMISSION ON STATE MANDATES HAS

04:01:14.560 --> 04:01:16.562
RULED THAT COSTS ARE NON

04:01:16.628 --> 04:01:17.663
REIMBURSABLE, LEAVING COUNTIES

04:01:17.729 --> 04:01:19.832
AND COURTS TO DEAL WITH THE

04:01:19.898 --> 04:01:22.301
BILL. WE SHOULD BE INVESTING IN

04:01:22.367 --> 04:01:24.169
RISK BASED TOOLS, SUPPORT

04:01:24.236 --> 04:01:27.039
SERVICES AND SURVIVOR CENTERED

04:01:27.105 --> 04:01:28.874
PRACTICES TO HELP PREVENT THESE

04:01:28.941 --> 04:01:30.375
TYPES OF CRIMES, NOT EXPANDING

04:01:30.442 --> 04:01:33.212
THE REGISTRY FOR LOW RISK CASES.

04:01:33.278 --> 04:01:36.081
SO SB 680 MOVES US BACKWARDS

04:01:36.148 --> 04:01:37.850
LEGALLY, FISCALLY AND IN TERMS

04:01:37.916 --> 04:01:39.718
OF SAFETY. SO ON BEHALF OF

04:01:39.785 --> 04:01:42.054
INITIATE JUSTICE, I URGE YOUR NO

04:01:42.120 --> 04:01:43.388

STRONG OPPOSITION. OKAY, FINAL

04:03:09.408 --> 04:03:11.910

NONE, WE'LL TURN IT BACK TO THE

QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS? SEEING

04:03:27.492 --> 04:03:28.794
NONE. SENATOR RUBIO, WOULD YOU

04:03:28.860 --> 04:03:30.429
LIKE TO PROVIDE A BRIEF CLOSING

04:03:30.495 --> 04:03:31.596
STATEMENT? YES. THANK YOU. I

04:03:31.663 --> 04:03:33.432
JUST LET ME JUST START BY

04:03:33.498 --> 04:03:33.966
ACKNOWLEDGING EVERYONE'S

04:03:34.032 --> 04:03:35.534
COMMENTS AND CONCERNS. BUT

04:03:35.600 --> 04:03:37.069
THERE'S SEVERAL THINGS THAT JUST

04:03:37.135 --> 04:03:38.804
BAFFLE ME. MOST OF YOU KNOW HOW

04:03:38.870 --> 04:03:40.505
HARD I WORK ON BEHALF OF

04:03:40.572 --> 04:03:41.440
VICTIMS. I'VE BEEN A VICTIMS

04:03:41.506 --> 04:03:43.608
ADVOCATE FOR A LONG TIME, AND,

04:03:43.675 --> 04:03:44.543
YOU KNOW, I FIND IT OFFENSIVE.

04:03:44.609 --> 04:03:46.244
I'M GOING TO SAY, FORGIVE ME FOR

04:03:46.311 --> 04:03:47.479
THOSE WHO KEEP SAYING IT OVER

04:03:47.546 --> 04:03:49.648
AND OVER AGAIN, THAT STRICTER

04:03:49.715 --> 04:03:50.582
PUNISHMENT AND PENALTIES DOES

04:03:50.649 --> 04:03:53.552
NOT MAKE IT SAFER. BUT THIS IS

04:03:53.618 --> 04:03:55.687
ABOUT JUSTICE FOR THOSE VICTIMS.

04:03:55.754 --> 04:03:58.156
IT'S ABOUT GIVING THESE

04:03:58.223 --> 04:03:59.858
INDIVIDUALS THEIR TIME IN COURT

04:03:59.925 --> 04:04:02.494
AND JUSTICE. I DID HEAR

04:04:02.561 --> 04:04:05.030
SOMETHING ABOUT THE OPPOSITION

04:04:05.097 --> 04:04:07.532
SAYING THAT WE MAY BE

04:04:07.599 --> 04:04:08.300
POTENTIALLY PUTTING PEOPLE THAT

04:04:08.367 --> 04:04:11.236
ARE NON-DANGEROUS IN HARM'S WAY.

04:04:11.303 --> 04:04:14.373
THIS IS ABOUT TEN YEARS APART.

04:04:14.439 --> 04:04:16.308
THIS IS ABOUT AN ADULT HAVING

04:04:16.375 --> 04:04:19.111
SEX WITH A MINOR THAT'S AT LEAST

04:04:19.177 --> 04:04:21.613
TEN YEARS OLDER. I HOPE ANYONE

04:04:21.680 --> 04:04:23.115
ON THIS DAIS DOESN'T THINK IT'S

04:04:23.181 --> 04:04:24.916
OKAY TO HAVE A 28 YEAR OLD

04:04:24.983 --> 04:04:28.186
HAVING SEX WITH SOMEONE THAT'S

04:04:28.253 --> 04:04:29.788
17 OR 25 WITH SOMEONE THAT'S,

04:04:29.855 --> 04:04:33.191
YOU KNOW, 14 THAT IS DANGEROUS.

04:04:33.258 --> 04:04:35.093
THAT IS DANGEROUS. SO SAYING

04:04:35.160 --> 04:04:37.062
THAT POTENTIALLY PUTTING PEOPLE

04:04:37.129 --> 04:04:39.264
IN JAIL OR HARM'S WAY BECAUSE,

04:04:39.331 --> 04:04:41.967
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE NOT DANGEROUS,

04:04:42.034 --> 04:04:43.502
IT IS DANGEROUS. SO I FIND THAT

04:04:43.568 --> 04:04:45.070
TO BE OFFENSIVE. AGAIN, THIS IS

04:04:45.137 --> 04:04:46.471
ABOUT JUSTICE FOR THOSE YOUNG

04:04:46.538 --> 04:04:47.739
LADIES WHO ARE HARMED. AND I

04:04:47.806 --> 04:04:49.341
KNOW THAT NO ONE HERE THINKS

04:04:49.408 --> 04:04:51.610
THAT IT IS OKAY TO HAVE SEX WITH

04:04:51.676 --> 04:04:53.445
A MINOR WHEN YOU'RE MORE THAN

04:04:53.512 --> 04:04:54.780
TEN YEARS OLDER THAN THAT MINOR,

04:04:54.846 --> 04:04:56.882
AND THINK THAT THAT CHILD

04:04:56.948 --> 04:04:58.617
CONSENTED AND HAD THE EXPERTISE,

04:04:58.683 --> 04:05:01.553
THE KNOW HOW, AND THE MATURITY

04:05:01.620 --> 04:05:03.688
TO CONSENT. SO WITH THAT, I

04:05:03.755 --> 04:05:04.956
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN EVIL.

04:05:05.023 --> 04:05:05.724
WELL, THANK YOU, SENATOR RUBIO,

04:05:05.791 --> 04:05:07.292
VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION

04:05:07.359 --> 04:05:09.127
TODAY. COLLEAGUES, I AM

04:05:09.194 --> 04:05:11.830
RECOMMENDING AN AYE. I, I AGREE

04:05:11.897 --> 04:05:13.532
WITH THE SENATOR. I THINK THAT

04:05:13.598 --> 04:05:14.966
THE FACT PATTERN THAT SHE JUST

04:05:15.033 --> 04:05:16.601
SET FORTH, I THINK WE WOULD ALL

04:05:16.668 --> 04:05:17.669
AGREE, IS COMPLETELY

04:05:17.736 --> 04:05:18.637
UNACCEPTABLE AND SHOULD BE

04:05:18.703 --> 04:05:19.771
GUARDED AGAINST. I ACKNOWLEDGE

04:05:19.838 --> 04:05:20.705
FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT THERE

04:05:20.772 --> 04:05:22.474
ARE LEGITIMATE QUESTIONS ABOUT

04:05:22.541 --> 04:05:23.875
ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES, BUT

04:05:23.942 --> 04:05:24.609
RESPECTFULLY, THOSE ARE BEYOND

04:05:24.676 --> 04:05:25.744
THE PURVIEW OF THIS COMMITTEE.

04:05:25.811 --> 04:05:27.512
AS A MATTER OF POLICY, I FIND IT

04:05:27.579 --> 04:05:29.414
TO BE APPROPRIATE. I AM

04:05:29.481 --> 04:05:30.782
RECOMMENDING AN AYE, LET'S CALL

04:05:30.849 --> 04:05:33.718

OKAY. THAT MEASURE REMAINS ON

04:05:52.904 --> 04:05:54.573
CALL. WE'LL LET YOU KNOW THE

04:05:54.639 --> 04:05:55.373
OUTCOME. WE'LL GET SOME ABSENT

GENTLEMEN, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE

OUR RECESS FOR THE LUNCH HOUR.

04:06:00.345 --> 04:06:00.879
NOW, WE'LL RECONVENE AT 1:30

04:06:00.946 --> 04:06:02.514
P.M. I'M JUST GOING TO NOTE THAT

04:06:02.581 --> 04:06:04.216
IF SENATOR RUBIO IS HERE, WE

04:06:04.282 --> 04:06:06.218
WILL START WITH HER. IF YOU ARE

04:06:06.284 --> 04:06:06.785
STAFF WATCHING, THE NEXT IN

04:06:06.852 --> 04:06:08.620
ORDER WOULD BE SENATORS DURAZZO.

04:06:08.687 --> 04:06:11.123
OH, SORRY. SENATOR HURTADO

THEY CAN ALL BE HERE CLOSE TO

04:06:15.227 --> 04:06:17.496
130 OR 145, THAT WOULD BE IDEAL.

04:06:17.562 --> 04:06:36.081
WE STAND IN RECESS ALSO.

06:09:07.391 --> 06:09:21.072
OH, SORRY. OKAY.

06:09:21.138 --> 06:09:24.575
I HIT GOBLIN. ALL RIGHT, WE'RE

06:09:24.642 --> 06:09:26.377
BACK FROM RECESS AND WE'RE GOING

06:09:26.444 --> 06:09:35.019
TO START WITH SENATOR HURTADO.

06:09:35.086 --> 06:09:41.592
SB 763. YES. ITEM 21. FLOOR IS

06:09:41.659 --> 06:09:57.708

06:09:57.775 --> 06:10:02.280
I GOT HIM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

06:10:02.346 --> 06:10:05.750
GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M HERE TO

06:10:05.816 --> 06:10:09.921
PRESENT SB 763, WHICH INCREASES

06:10:09.987 --> 06:10:11.489
PENALTIES UNDER THE CARTWRIGHT

06:10:11.556 --> 06:10:13.257
ACT, OUR STATE'S PRIMARY

06:10:13.324 --> 06:10:14.926
ANTITRUST LAW, WHICH HAS NOT

06:10:14.992 --> 06:10:17.962
BEEN MEANINGFULLY UPDATED IN

06:10:18.029 --> 06:10:20.831
DECADES. SB 763 UPDATES

06:10:20.898 --> 06:10:21.999
PENALTIES UNDER THE CARTWRIGHT

06:10:22.066 --> 06:10:24.168
ACT. SO THEY ACTUALLY MEAN

06:10:24.235 --> 06:10:26.504
SOMETHING IN TODAY'S ECONOMIC

06:10:26.571 --> 06:10:28.639
REALITY. WE'RE NOT PROPOSING ANY

06:10:28.706 --> 06:10:30.141
PHOENIX TRÃN. WE'RE SIMPLY

06:10:30.207 --> 06:10:31.876
ENSURING THAT VIOLATING OUR

06:10:31.943 --> 06:10:34.779
ANTITRUST LAWS COMES WITH REAL,

06:10:34.845 --> 06:10:38.049
ENFORCEABLE CONSEQUENCES.

06:10:38.115 --> 06:10:39.450
CONSEQUENCES BIG ENOUGH TO MAKE

06:10:39.517 --> 06:10:41.185
DOMINANT FIRMS AND INDIVIDUALS

06:10:41.252 --> 06:10:43.087
THINK TWICE BEFORE THEY RIG THE

06:10:43.154 --> 06:10:46.357
MARKET. SB 763 RAISES THE STAKES

06:10:46.424 --> 06:10:48.526
NOT TO PUNISH, BUT TO DETER,

06:10:48.593 --> 06:10:50.194
BECAUSE WHEN THERE'S NO REAL

06:10:50.261 --> 06:10:51.963
PENALTY, THERE'S NO REAL REASON

06:10:52.029 --> 06:10:53.864
TO STOP. AND WHEN BAD ACTORS

06:10:53.931 --> 06:10:56.300
DON'T STOP, WE ALL ULTIMATELY

06:10:56.367 --> 06:10:58.669
PAY THE PRICE AT THE GROCERY

06:10:58.736 --> 06:11:00.371
STORE, AT THE GAS PUMP, IN OUR

06:11:00.438 --> 06:11:01.872
RENT, AND IN THE BUSINESSES THAT

06:11:01.939 --> 06:11:03.941
ARE CHEATED FROM A FAIR

06:11:04.008 --> 06:11:06.544
OPPORTUNITY IN THE MARKET. THIS

06:11:06.611 --> 06:11:08.412
BILL ISN'T JUST ABOUT TAKING ON

06:11:08.479 --> 06:11:09.580
MONOPOLIES OR GLOBAL GIANTS.

06:11:09.647 --> 06:11:11.282
IT'S ABOUT STOPPING BIG PLAYERS

06:11:11.349 --> 06:11:14.752
WHO USE POWER, NOT INNOVATION,

06:11:14.819 --> 06:11:17.121
TO LOCK OTHERS OUT. WHETHER IT'S

06:11:17.188 --> 06:11:18.823
A CORPORATE CHAIN PUSHING OUT

06:11:18.889 --> 06:11:20.391
LOCAL STORES OR A DOMINANT

06:11:20.458 --> 06:11:22.760
SUPPLIER, SETTING PRICES IN A

06:11:22.827 --> 06:11:25.496
CLOSED MARKET, THE STORY IS THE

06:11:25.563 --> 06:11:27.999
SAME RIG THE SYSTEM, BLOCK THE

06:11:28.065 --> 06:11:29.734
COMPETITION AND MAKE EVERYONE

06:11:29.800 --> 06:11:32.737
ELSE PAY. SB 763 IS ABOUT

06:11:32.803 --> 06:11:35.306
STANDING UP FOR PEOPLE, FOR THE

06:11:35.373 --> 06:11:37.141
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WHO WE KNOW

06:11:37.208 --> 06:11:39.176
ARE SUFFERING. WHILE MAJOR

06:11:39.243 --> 06:11:40.578
CORPORATIONS RAKE IN RECORD

06:11:40.645 --> 06:11:43.547
PROFITS, CALIFORNIANS DESERVE A

06:11:43.614 --> 06:11:46.083
COMPETITIVE ECONOMY THAT WORKS

06:11:46.150 --> 06:11:49.286
FOR EVERYONE. IT'S ABOUT

06:11:49.353 --> 06:11:50.755
ENSURING THAT THE LAW PROTECTS

06:11:50.821 --> 06:11:52.657
THE MANY AND DOESN'T JUST FAVOR

06:11:52.723 --> 06:11:56.227
THE FEW. THANK YOU. I

06:11:56.293 --> 06:11:58.195
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE

06:11:58.262 --> 06:11:59.764

SO ONE EXAMPLE IS A FORMER

06:12:56.487 --> 06:12:57.555
CALTRANS CONTRACT MANAGER. AND

BIDS FOR CALTRANS CONTRACTS.

06:13:07.798 --> 06:13:10.568
MANAGER RECEIVED 800,000 IN

06:13:10.634 --> 06:13:11.368
BRIBES AND WAS ULTIMATELY

06:13:11.435 --> 06:13:13.104
SENTENCED TO OVER FOUR YEARS IN

06:13:13.170 --> 06:13:15.406
JAIL AND FINED ALMOST $1

06:13:15.473 --> 06:13:17.074
MILLION. ONE OF THE OTHER

06:13:17.141 --> 06:13:18.042
CONSPIRATORS RECEIVED A SENTENCE

06:13:18.109 --> 06:13:19.643
JUST UNDER FOUR YEARS, AND WAS

06:13:19.710 --> 06:13:22.379
ORDERED TO PAY $800,000 IN

06:13:22.446 --> 06:13:24.148
RESTITUTION. ANOTHER CONSPIRATOR

06:13:24.215 --> 06:13:25.583
WAS SENTENCED TO SIX AND A HALF

06:13:25.649 --> 06:13:27.518
YEARS IN JAIL, AND ORDERED TO

06:13:27.585 --> 06:13:29.286
PAY NEARLY 1 MILLION IN

06:13:29.353 --> 06:13:30.554
RESTITUTION. THE VICTIMS IN

06:13:30.621 --> 06:13:33.190
THESE CASES WERE THE CALIFORNIA

06:13:33.257 --> 06:13:35.426
TAXPAYERS WHO OVERPAID FOR THE

06:13:35.493 --> 06:13:37.228
CONTRACTS, AS WELL AS THE LAW

06:13:37.294 --> 06:13:39.029
ABIDING BUSINESSES WHO COMPETED

06:13:39.096 --> 06:13:40.765
HONESTLY BUT WERE DENIED THE

06:13:40.831 --> 06:13:41.932
CONTRACTS DUE TO THE BID

06:13:41.999 --> 06:13:44.835
RIGGING. IN ANOTHER CASE, THIS

06:13:44.902 --> 06:13:46.937
ONE WAS IN NEVADA. AN OWNER OF A

06:13:47.004 --> 06:13:48.706
HEALTHCARE STAFFING COMPANY

06:13:48.773 --> 06:13:50.107
CONSPIRED WITH OTHER COMPANIES

06:13:50.174 --> 06:13:52.409
TO FIX THE WAGES FOR NURSES. TO

06:13:52.476 --> 06:13:54.145
QUOTE THE INDICTMENT, THEY SENT

06:13:54.211 --> 06:13:56.313
TEXT MESSAGES EXPLICITLY SAYING,

06:13:56.380 --> 06:13:58.249
WE ALL HAVE A MUTUAL AGREEMENT

06:13:58.315 --> 06:13:59.917
THAT ALL THREE COMPANIES WILL

06:13:59.984 --> 06:14:01.719
STAY WITHIN THE SAME HOURLY

06:14:01.786 --> 06:14:03.888
RATE, FIXING PRICES, WHETHER

06:14:03.954 --> 06:14:05.890
THEIR PRICES FOR GOODS OR PRICES

06:14:05.956 --> 06:14:07.691
FOR WAGES, AGAIN, ARE CORE

06:14:07.758 --> 06:14:10.194
ANTITRUST CRIMES. THE INDICTMENT

06:14:10.261 --> 06:14:12.496
IN THAT CASE REQUESTS CRIMINAL

06:14:12.563 --> 06:14:14.965
FORFEITURE OF OVER 12.5 MILLION.

06:14:15.032 --> 06:14:17.067
SO WHY AM I TELLING YOU ABOUT

06:14:17.134 --> 06:14:19.436
THESE CASES? WHY DO WE EVEN NEED

06:14:19.503 --> 06:14:20.538
THIS BILL IF WE CAN ALREADY GET

06:14:20.604 --> 06:14:22.273
THESE SENTENCES AND FINES?

06:14:22.339 --> 06:14:24.408
BECAUSE THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY

06:14:24.475 --> 06:14:25.509
GENERAL'S OFFICE DIDN'T BRING

06:14:25.576 --> 06:14:28.579
THESE CASES. THESE ARE U.S.

06:14:28.646 --> 06:14:30.414
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

06:14:30.481 --> 06:14:31.982
PROSECUTIONS. WE HAVE NOT

06:14:32.049 --> 06:14:33.384
BROUGHT A CALIFORNIA STATE

06:14:33.450 --> 06:14:35.419
CRIMINAL ANTITRUST CASE IN 30

06:14:35.486 --> 06:14:37.688
YEARS, BECAUSE WE HAVE

06:14:37.755 --> 06:14:39.557
COMPLETELY ABDICATED, AND WE

06:14:39.623 --> 06:14:41.625
COMPLETELY RELY ON THE FEDERAL

06:14:41.692 --> 06:14:44.161
GOVERNMENT TO BRING THESE CASES.

06:14:44.228 --> 06:14:46.363
LET ME BE CLEAR, AND I'M ONE OF

06:14:46.430 --> 06:14:48.833
THE FEW PEOPLE WHO WILL SAY THIS

06:14:48.899 --> 06:14:50.201
TODAY, HAVING LISTENED TO THE

06:14:50.267 --> 06:14:51.068
TESTIMONY THIS MORNING, EVEN

06:14:51.135 --> 06:14:52.469
RIGHT NOW UNDER THE TRUMP

06:14:52.536 --> 06:14:53.470
ADMINISTRATION, THIS U.S.

06:14:53.537 --> 06:14:55.339
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, THEY HAVE

06:14:55.406 --> 06:14:57.007
GOOD ANTITRUST PROSECUTORS, AND

06:14:57.074 --> 06:14:58.542
THEY ARE GOOD COLLEAGUES OF

06:14:58.609 --> 06:15:02.346
MINE. BUT THEY CAN CHANGE THEIR

06:15:02.413 --> 06:15:04.682
MINDS. THEY CAN DECIDE TO HAVE

06:15:04.748 --> 06:15:06.884
DIFFERENT PRIORITIES. THEY CAN

06:15:06.951 --> 06:15:08.619
DECIDE THAT IMMIGRATION IS MORE

06:15:08.686 --> 06:15:09.987
IMPORTANT. THEY CAN DECIDE THAT

06:15:10.054 --> 06:15:11.922
FLORIDA AND TEXAS ANTITRUST IS

06:15:11.989 --> 06:15:13.958
MORE IMPORTANT THAN PROTECTING

06:15:14.024 --> 06:15:16.927
CALIFORNIA PROCUREMENTS. THE US

06:15:16.994 --> 06:15:19.363
DOJ OBVIOUSLY SETS ITS OWN

06:15:19.430 --> 06:15:21.465
PRIORITIES. CRIMINAL ANTITRUST,

06:15:21.532 --> 06:15:23.334
WHICH IS FOCUSED ON WHITE COLLAR

06:15:23.400 --> 06:15:24.869
CRIME, IS ABOUT DETERRENCE. AND

06:15:24.935 --> 06:15:25.903
I'VE HEARD MANY WITNESSES ALSO

06:15:25.970 --> 06:15:28.072
SAY THAT LONGER SENTENCES ARE

06:15:28.138 --> 06:15:30.875
NOT EFFECTIVE. THEY ARE IN THESE

06:15:30.941 --> 06:15:32.776
TYPES OF WHITE COLLAR CRIMES.

06:15:32.843 --> 06:15:35.646
THESE ARE WHITE COLLAR. THE

06:15:35.713 --> 06:15:38.148
TRADITIONAL WHITE COLLAR

06:15:38.215 --> 06:15:40.284
DEFENDANT HAS $1 MILLION COMPANY

06:15:40.351 --> 06:15:41.585
IS BIDDING ON MILLION DOLLAR

06:15:41.652 --> 06:15:42.887
CONTRACTS. AND WHAT WE ARE

06:15:42.953 --> 06:15:44.421
TRYING TO DO IS A COUPLE OF

06:15:44.488 --> 06:15:46.423
PROCUREMENTS A YEAR TO KEEP THEM

06:15:46.490 --> 06:15:47.791
FROM, TO SEND THE MESSAGE THAT

06:15:47.858 --> 06:15:49.159
YOU CANNOT STEP OVER THAT LINE,

06:15:49.226 --> 06:15:51.562
YOU CANNOT BE TEMPTED. THE U.S.

06:15:51.629 --> 06:15:52.897
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE OVER THE

06:15:52.963 --> 06:15:55.366
ENTIRE COUNTRY BRINGS AN AVERAGE

06:15:55.432 --> 06:15:58.369
OF 27 CASES A YEAR. NEW YORK AS

06:15:58.435 --> 06:16:00.137
ANOTHER EXAMPLE, A STATE EXAMPLE

06:16:00.204 --> 06:16:01.772
BRINGS SLIGHTLY LESS THAN ONE.

06:16:01.839 --> 06:16:03.807
THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL

06:16:03.874 --> 06:16:06.277
WOULD PROBABLY BRING 1 TO 3

06:16:06.343 --> 06:16:09.680
CASES A YEAR. WE ARE NOT GOING

06:16:09.747 --> 06:16:11.015
TO FLOOD THE JAILS. ONE OF THE

06:16:11.081 --> 06:16:12.416
REASONS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS NOT

06:16:12.483 --> 06:16:14.285
BROUGHT CRIMINAL ANTITRUST CASES

06:16:14.351 --> 06:16:17.021
IS THAT OUR FINES AND JAIL TIME

06:16:17.087 --> 06:16:19.957
ARE SO MUCH LOWER THAN WHAT THE

06:16:20.024 --> 06:16:21.492
FEDS CAN ACHIEVE. THE SENTENCES

06:16:21.558 --> 06:16:22.860
I JUST READ YOU FOR THOSE

06:16:22.927 --> 06:16:24.361
CALTRANS THINGS. I CAN'T GET

06:16:24.428 --> 06:16:25.629
THOSE UNDER CALIFORNIA STATE

06:16:25.696 --> 06:16:28.265
LAW. SO AS A PROSECUTOR, I LOOK

06:16:28.332 --> 06:16:30.467
AT A CASE AND I HAVE TO DEFER TO

06:16:30.534 --> 06:16:32.202
THE FEDS BECAUSE THEY HAVE MUCH

06:16:32.269 --> 06:16:35.372
HIGHER PENALTIES FOR CRIMINALS.

06:16:35.439 --> 06:16:37.041
SO WITH THAT, I THANK YOU VERY

06:16:37.107 --> 06:16:38.375
MUCH FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY,

06:16:38.442 --> 06:16:40.544
AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO

06:16:40.611 --> 06:16:43.280
SUPPORT SB 763 AND PROVIDE A

06:16:43.347 --> 06:16:45.149
LONG OVERDUE UPDATE TO THE

06:16:45.215 --> 06:16:46.517
ANTITRUST PENALTIES UNDER THE

06:16:46.583 --> 06:16:48.752
CARTWRIGHT ACT. THANK YOU, THANK

06:16:48.819 --> 06:16:49.620
YOU, THANK YOU FOR YOUR

06:16:49.687 --> 06:16:50.521
TESTIMONY. I'M SURE SOME OTHERS

06:16:50.587 --> 06:16:52.456
ARE GOING TO BE USING YOU NOW ON

06:16:52.523 --> 06:16:54.425
THEIR TESTIMONIES WITH WHAT YOU

06:16:54.491 --> 06:16:56.393
JUST SAID. ANYONE ELSE IN

06:16:56.460 --> 06:17:00.197

START WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK

06:17:42.506 --> 06:17:43.741
AMENDMENTS THAT THE SENATE

06:17:43.807 --> 06:17:45.109
APPROPRIATIONS PUT INTO THE BILL

06:17:45.175 --> 06:17:47.378
WE HAVE REMOVED. SORRY. BÃN

06:17:47.444 --> 06:17:49.513
CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.

06:17:49.580 --> 06:17:51.382
WE HAVE REMOVED THE COST DRIVER

06:17:51.448 --> 06:17:52.750
LABEL FROM THE BILL. HOWEVER, WE

06:17:52.816 --> 06:17:55.119
MUST REMAIN OPPOSED. WE BELIEVE

06:17:55.185 --> 06:17:57.021
THAT THIS BILL IS PREMATURE, AS

06:17:57.087 --> 06:17:58.989
THE CALIFORNIA LAW REVISION

06:17:59.056 --> 06:18:00.290
COMMISSION IS IN THE FINAL

06:18:00.357 --> 06:18:01.892
STAGES OF COMPLETING A MULTIYEAR

06:18:01.959 --> 06:18:03.694
STUDY OF THE STATE'S ANTITRUST

06:18:03.761 --> 06:18:05.763
LAWS. WE ARE EXPECTING THOSE

06:18:05.829 --> 06:18:06.463
RECOMMENDATIONS AT THE END OF

06:18:06.530 --> 06:18:08.699
THIS CALENDAR YEAR, AND THEN

06:18:08.766 --> 06:18:10.134
SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATION RELATED

06:18:10.200 --> 06:18:12.169
TO THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS NEXT

06:18:12.236 --> 06:18:14.805
YEAR, DRAMATICALLY EXPANDING THE

06:18:14.872 --> 06:18:16.206
ASSOCIATED PENALTIES BEFORE THIS

06:18:16.273 --> 06:18:18.308
REPORT IS COMPLETE AND THE

06:18:18.375 --> 06:18:20.411
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE IN PLACE, IS

06:18:20.477 --> 06:18:21.345
LITERALLY THE DEFINITION OF

06:18:21.412 --> 06:18:22.479
PUTTING THE CART BEFORE THE

06:18:22.546 --> 06:18:24.181

06:18:24.248 --> 06:18:26.216
THEREFORE, WE MUST RESPECTFULLY

06:18:26.283 --> 06:18:30.254
REMAIN OPPOSED TO SB 763. MR.

SHARE THE SAME CONCERNS THAT MR.

06:18:39.229 --> 06:18:42.533
HOLLENBECK JUST OUTLINED. WE

06:18:42.599 --> 06:18:44.234
THINK THAT THE CALIFORNIA LAW

06:18:44.301 --> 06:18:46.103
REVISION COMMISSION PROCESS

06:18:46.170 --> 06:18:49.006
SHOULD DEFINITELY PLAY OUT. I

06:18:49.073 --> 06:18:50.340
KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME

06:18:50.407 --> 06:18:53.644
COMPARISON BETWEEN THE FEDERAL

06:18:53.710 --> 06:18:55.079
ANTITRUST ACT AS WELL AS THE

06:18:55.145 --> 06:18:56.914
STATE. I'VE POINTED OUT, AS I

06:18:56.980 --> 06:18:58.715
HAVE IN PREVIOUS COMMITTEES ON

06:18:58.782 --> 06:19:01.151
THIS BILL, THAT THE CALIFORNIA

06:19:01.218 --> 06:19:03.821
SUPREME COURT HAS OPINED THAT

06:19:03.887 --> 06:19:05.556
CALIFORNIA'S CARTWRIGHT ACT IS

06:19:05.622 --> 06:19:07.324
BROADER IN RANGE AND DEEPER IN

06:19:07.391 --> 06:19:09.460
REACH THAN THE FEDERAL SHERMAN

06:19:09.526 --> 06:19:11.962
ANTITRUST ACT. I WOULD ALSO LIKE

06:19:12.029 --> 06:19:13.730
TO REMIND YOU THAT ON THE CIVIL

06:19:13.797 --> 06:19:15.866
SIDE, THERE ARE TREBLE DAMAGES,

06:19:15.933 --> 06:19:17.768
ATTORNEY'S FEES AND COSTS FOR

06:19:17.835 --> 06:19:18.769

IMPRISONMENT AND HEAVY CRIMINAL

PENALTIES ARE AVAILABLE. AND SO

06:19:26.410 --> 06:19:27.978
FOR THOSE REASONS, WE REMAIN IN

DAVIS, CALIFORNIA. I HAVE BEEN

06:27:46.810 --> 06:27:49.145
BENDING CHURROS AND FRESCAS FOR

06:27:49.212 --> 06:27:50.880
OVER TWO YEARS. I'M ALSO A DACA

06:27:50.947 --> 06:27:52.215
RECIPIENT. I'M A UC DAVIS

06:27:52.282 --> 06:27:53.383
GRADUATE. I'M CURRENTLY STUDYING

06:27:53.450 --> 06:27:55.619
TO TAKE THE LSAT. I HAVE THREE

06:27:55.685 --> 06:27:56.753
CHILDREN, A TWO YEAR OLD, A

06:27:56.820 --> 06:27:58.555
THREE YEAR OLD, AND A NINE YEAR

06:27:58.622 --> 06:28:00.724
OLD. STREET VENDING HAS GIVEN ME

06:28:00.790 --> 06:28:01.257
FINANCIAL FREEDOM AND HAS

06:28:01.324 --> 06:28:02.759
ALLOWED ME TO SUPPORT MY FAMILY

06:28:02.826 --> 06:28:04.561
AND ME. BUT TODAY, THERE IS AN

06:28:04.628 --> 06:28:06.062
IMMINENT THREAT THAT COULD

06:28:06.129 --> 06:28:07.631
JEOPARDIZE OUR FUTURE. THIS IS

06:28:07.697 --> 06:28:08.732
BECAUSE IN SOME CITIES, STREET

06:28:08.798 --> 06:28:09.332
VENDING LIKE MYSELF, JUMPED

06:28:09.399 --> 06:28:10.567
THROUGH NUMEROUS UNJUSTIFIABLE

06:28:10.634 --> 06:28:11.768
LOOPS AND BARRIERS JUST TO

06:28:11.835 --> 06:28:13.269
OBTAIN A PERMIT. FOR EXAMPLE,

06:28:13.336 --> 06:28:14.971
THEY REQUIRE THE EXCLUSIVE

06:28:15.038 --> 06:28:16.706
DISCLOSURE OF SENSITIVE

06:28:16.773 --> 06:28:17.340
INFORMATION. THESE BARRIERS ARE

06:28:17.407 --> 06:28:18.675
NEVER PLACED IN FRONT OF ANY

06:28:18.742 --> 06:28:19.976
OTHER ENTREPRENEURS WHO START

06:28:20.043 --> 06:28:22.145
THEIR OWN BUSINESSES. THE EXTRA

06:28:22.212 --> 06:28:23.246
BURDEN AND FEAR DETER PEOPLE

06:28:23.313 --> 06:28:25.015
FROM APPLYING FOR THE VENDING

06:28:25.081 --> 06:28:26.850
LICENSE. THIS PROCESS IS ALSO A

06:28:26.916 --> 06:28:28.952
DOUBLE EDGED SWORD BECAUSE IF WE

06:28:29.019 --> 06:28:30.353
DO NOT APPLY FOR THE LICENSE,

06:28:30.420 --> 06:28:31.354
THE CITY WILL NOT STOP CITING

06:28:31.421 --> 06:28:33.356
AND HARASSING US. BUT IF WE DO

06:28:33.423 --> 06:28:34.624
APPLY, WE COULD BE SEPARATED

06:28:34.691 --> 06:28:35.759
FROM OUR FAMILIES. IF OUR

06:28:35.825 --> 06:28:36.926
INFORMATION GETS SHARED WITH

06:28:36.993 --> 06:28:38.728
ICE. THESE DOUBLE STANDARD

06:28:38.795 --> 06:28:39.696
REQUIREMENTS FOR VENDORS ARE

06:28:39.763 --> 06:28:41.231
JUST ONE OF THE MANY WAYS THAT

06:28:41.297 --> 06:28:43.033
OUR LAWS TRY TO SUPPRESS

06:28:43.099 --> 06:28:44.934
ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY FOR

06:28:45.001 --> 06:28:45.835
IMMIGRANTS, ESPECIALLY LOW

06:28:45.902 --> 06:28:49.773
INCOME PEOPLE OF COLOR. ONE OF

06:28:49.839 --> 06:28:51.007
THE REASONS MANY CITIES REQUIRE

06:28:51.074 --> 06:28:52.308
THESE EXTRA STEPS IS BECAUSE

06:28:52.375 --> 06:28:54.010
CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS HAVE SO

06:28:54.077 --> 06:28:55.478
MUCH MISINFORMATION ABOUT STREET

06:28:55.545 --> 06:28:57.080
VENDORS. ALSO, BECAUSE MANY

06:28:57.147 --> 06:28:58.014
POWERFUL BUSINESS OWNERS HAVE

06:28:58.081 --> 06:28:59.582
STAMPED AN UNJUSTIFIABLE STIGMA

06:28:59.649 --> 06:29:01.618
OF UNFAIR COMPETITION TOWARDS

06:29:01.685 --> 06:29:02.786
VENDORS, THESE COMPLAINTS HAVE

06:29:02.852 --> 06:29:04.354
HELPED CREATE AN ANTI VENDOR

06:29:04.421 --> 06:29:05.955
ATMOSPHERE. THIS IS EVEN MORE

06:29:06.022 --> 06:29:07.757
TERRIFYING TODAY BECAUSE OF THE

06:29:07.824 --> 06:29:08.792
CURRENT ANTI-IMMIGRANT

06:29:08.858 --> 06:29:09.225
ATMOSPHERE, WITH THE

06:29:09.292 --> 06:29:09.726
CONSEQUENCES OF SHARING

06:29:09.793 --> 06:29:12.062
SENSITIVE INFORMATION COULD LEAD

06:29:12.128 --> 06:29:13.630
TO DEPORTATION. FOR EXAMPLE, ICE

06:29:13.697 --> 06:29:15.432
CANNOT CITIES FOR DATA ABOUT

06:29:15.498 --> 06:29:16.599
VENDORS SUCH AS PLACE OF

06:29:16.666 --> 06:29:18.034
RESIDENCY AND VENDING LOCATION

06:29:18.101 --> 06:29:19.836
WITHOUT ANY DUE PROCESS. MANY

06:29:19.903 --> 06:29:21.371
STREET VENDORS ARE UNDOCUMENTED

06:29:21.438 --> 06:29:22.572
AND MANY DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH, SO

06:29:22.639 --> 06:29:24.774
THE CHANCES OF THEM CHALLENGING

06:29:24.841 --> 06:29:25.775
DISCRIMINATORY LAWS IN COURT IS

06:29:25.842 --> 06:29:28.211
VERY LOW. I HOPE WE CAN WORK

06:29:28.278 --> 06:29:29.512
TOGETHER TODAY TO CHANGE THESE

06:29:29.579 --> 06:29:31.715
LAWS, AND I HOPE IN THE FUTURE

06:29:31.781 --> 06:29:32.482
TO BE SOMEONE WHO CAN REWRITE

06:29:32.549 --> 06:29:34.884
AND CHALLENGE ANTI VENDOR LAWS

06:29:34.951 --> 06:29:37.454
IN COURT. BEFORE I GO, I WANT TO

06:29:37.520 --> 06:29:38.655
EMPHASIZE THAT I'M NOT JUST HERE

06:29:38.722 --> 06:29:40.590
FIGHTING FOR MY JOB, I'M

06:29:40.657 --> 06:29:41.424
FIGHTING FOR OTHER DADS AND

06:29:41.491 --> 06:29:42.659

06:29:42.726 --> 06:29:43.993
FAMILIES TOGETHER AND THRIVING.

06:29:44.060 --> 06:29:45.628
MY CHILDREN DESERVE THE RIGHT TO

06:29:45.695 --> 06:29:46.930
HAVE THEIR FATHER PRESENT TO

06:29:46.996 --> 06:29:48.798
SUPPORT THEM EMOTIONALLY AND

06:29:48.865 --> 06:29:50.900
ECONOMICALLY, AND I WILL FIGHT

06:29:50.967 --> 06:29:51.701
TO RETAIN THAT RIGHT FOR ALL OF

06:29:51.768 --> 06:29:53.870

06:29:53.937 --> 06:29:55.739

IMPORTANTLY, OUR AREA IS JUST

06:33:32.121 --> 06:33:33.856

06:33:37.794 --> 06:33:39.062
DIFFERENT THINGS AND KNOW THAT

06:33:39.128 --> 06:33:40.797
THE STREET VENDORS ARE THE

06:33:40.863 --> 06:33:42.598
HEARTBEAT OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS.

06:33:42.665 --> 06:33:43.666
THEY ARE THE SMALL BUSINESS

06:33:50.106 --> 06:33:53.242
DOES PROTECT THEM FROM BEING

06:33:53.309 --> 06:33:54.677
CRIMINALIZED OR, YOU KNOW, FOR

06:33:54.744 --> 06:33:56.512

DIGNITY. NO ONE, NO ONE SHOULD

06:33:59.615 --> 06:34:00.950
HAVE TO LIVE IN FEAR THAT ARE

06:34:01.017 --> 06:34:02.585
JUST SIMPLY SHARING THEIR CRAFTS

06:34:02.652 --> 06:34:05.021
OF, YOU KNOW, BEING ABLE TO MAKE

06:34:05.088 --> 06:34:07.557
OR TACOS OR NOODLES AND HAVING

06:34:07.623 --> 06:34:09.659
IT LEAD TO ARRESTS AND

06:34:09.726 --> 06:34:10.793
DEPORTATION. AND THERE ARE MANY

06:34:10.860 --> 06:34:12.729
PEOPLE WHO BENEFIT FROM THE FROM

06:34:12.795 --> 06:34:14.430
THE LABOR, FROM THE FRUITS THAT

06:34:14.497 --> 06:34:15.932
WE SEE AND THE CULTURES. BUT

06:34:15.999 --> 06:34:16.966
THEN THEY WANT TO CRIMINALIZE

06:34:17.033 --> 06:34:18.801
THEM AND PENALIZE THEM. AND SO

06:34:18.868 --> 06:34:20.036
THIS BILL HELPS TO SAFEGUARD

06:34:20.103 --> 06:34:21.637
THEM, TO PROTECT, PROTECT OUR

06:34:21.704 --> 06:34:23.373
STREET VENDORS WHO ARE JUST

06:34:23.439 --> 06:34:25.174
TRYING TO GET BY AND HAVE A

06:34:25.241 --> 06:34:26.642
LIVING, PUT A ROOF OVER THEIR

06:34:26.709 --> 06:34:28.211
HEADS, SEND THEIR KIDS TO

06:34:28.277 --> 06:34:28.911
SCHOOL, AND THEY'RE NOT

06:34:28.978 --> 06:34:30.680
DEPENDING ON THEIR GOVERNMENT TO

06:34:30.747 --> 06:34:32.415
GET THEM BY THEIR DEPENDING ON

EVERY DAY. AND WE HAVE BEEN

06:34:35.785 --> 06:34:37.220
WATCHING IN LOS ANGELES,

06:34:37.286 --> 06:34:39.055
SPECIFICALLY, WHERE TACO TRUCKS

06:34:39.122 --> 06:34:41.024
ON THEIR OWN ARE BEING RAIDED.

06:34:41.090 --> 06:34:42.925
AND UNFORTUNATELY, PRIOR TO THE

06:34:42.992 --> 06:34:44.260
RAIDS, THEY WERE BEING ROBBED.

06:34:44.327 --> 06:34:46.496
AND SO EVERY MEASURE IN PLACE

06:34:46.562 --> 06:34:47.897
THAT THIS BILL IS DOING IS

06:34:47.964 --> 06:34:48.965

YOU, MR. CHAIR. AND VERY RELATED

TO THE STREET VENDORS. BECAUSE

06:36:17.987 --> 06:36:19.956
OF THE RAIDS THAT HAVE BEEN

06:36:20.022 --> 06:36:21.724
TAKING PLACE ALL OVER CALIFORNIA

06:36:21.791 --> 06:36:25.094
AND OTHER STATES, THERE'S REAL

06:36:25.161 --> 06:36:27.930
FEAR IN LOS ANGELES RIGHT NOW.

06:36:27.997 --> 06:36:30.099
PARENTS, WORKERS, GRANDPARENTS,

06:36:30.166 --> 06:36:32.068
YOUNG PEOPLE, THEY'RE SCARED TO

06:36:32.135 --> 06:36:34.103
GO ABOUT THEIR DAILY LIVES AS A

06:36:34.170 --> 06:36:36.239
RESULT OF THESE MASS IMMIGRATION

06:36:36.305 --> 06:36:38.741
RAIDS. WE ARE SEEING ARMED AND

06:36:38.808 --> 06:36:41.744
MASKED MEN LEAP OUT OF UNMARKED

06:36:41.811 --> 06:36:43.045

06:36:43.112 --> 06:36:45.715
ASSAULT RIFLES, LATINO MEN TAKEN

06:36:45.781 --> 06:36:47.383
FROM THEIR PLACES OF WORK OR

06:36:47.450 --> 06:36:49.218
WHILE WAITING FOR THE BUS.

06:36:49.285 --> 06:36:50.953
STREET VENDORS, AS WE SAID,

06:36:51.020 --> 06:36:52.755
VIOLENTLY TACKLED TO THE GROUND

06:36:52.822 --> 06:36:55.958
AND FORCEFULLY HELD DOWN. ON

06:36:56.025 --> 06:36:58.494
JUNE 17TH, ADRIAN MARTINEZ, A 20

06:36:58.561 --> 06:37:00.329
YEAR OLD UNITED STATES CITIZEN

06:37:00.396 --> 06:37:02.798
FROM LOS ANGELES, WAS VIOLENTLY

06:37:02.865 --> 06:37:05.735
DETAINED BY ICE AGENTS AFTER

06:37:05.801 --> 06:37:08.271
DEFENDING AN ELDERLY JANITOR

06:37:08.337 --> 06:37:10.806
DURING A RAID OUTSIDE A WALMART.

06:37:10.873 --> 06:37:12.608
THE AGENTS ATTACKED MARTINEZ,

06:37:12.675 --> 06:37:14.010
THROWING HIM TO THE GROUND AND

06:37:14.076 --> 06:37:16.078
ARRESTING HIM AS THEY ASKED HIM

06:37:16.145 --> 06:37:20.917
FOR PROOF. HE WAS PROOF THAT HE

06:37:20.983 --> 06:37:23.386
WAS BORN IN THE UNITED STATES.

06:37:23.452 --> 06:37:25.621
MARTINEZ WAS HELD IN CUSTODY FOR

06:37:25.688 --> 06:37:27.056
THREE DAYS, DESPITE HIS MOTHER

06:37:27.123 --> 06:37:28.558
SHOWING UP TO THE FACILITY WITH

HIS U.S. BIRTH CERTIFICATE, HIS

06:37:31.127 --> 06:37:32.862
BODY STILL COVERED WITH CUTS AND

06:37:32.929 --> 06:37:34.163
BRUISES AND WEARING A KNEE

06:37:34.230 --> 06:37:37.166
BRACE. IF SOMEONE RUNS, THEY'RE

06:37:37.233 --> 06:37:39.302
TAKEN. WHEN THEY DON'T ANSWER A

06:37:39.368 --> 06:37:40.836
QUESTION, THEY'RE TAKEN WHEN

06:37:40.903 --> 06:37:42.505
THEY CAN'T PRODUCE PAPERS,

06:37:42.572 --> 06:37:44.707
THEY'RE TAKEN NOT KNOWING IF

06:37:44.774 --> 06:37:46.509
IT'S A LAW ENFORCEMENT OPERATION

06:37:46.576 --> 06:37:49.312
OR A KIDNAPING. SINCE EARLY

06:37:49.378 --> 06:37:51.547
JUNE, THE STREETS OF LOS ANGELES

06:37:51.614 --> 06:37:54.817
HAVE BORNE WITNESS TO FREQUENT

06:37:54.884 --> 06:37:56.953
MILITARY STYLE IMMIGRATION RAIDS

06:37:57.019 --> 06:37:58.254
THAT HAVE SEEN PEOPLE, QUOTE

06:37:58.321 --> 06:38:01.224
UNQUOTE, SUSPECTED OF BEING

06:38:01.290 --> 06:38:03.960
UNDOCUMENTED MIGRANTS DETAINED.

06:38:04.026 --> 06:38:07.396
SOME HAVE BEEN DEPORTED. THIS

06:38:07.463 --> 06:38:09.465
ISN'T LAW AND ORDER. IT'S FEAR

06:38:09.532 --> 06:38:13.169
AND CHAOS MEANT TO DIVIDE US. AS

06:38:13.236 --> 06:38:15.271
CR NINE STRONGLY DENOUNCES THE

06:38:15.338 --> 06:38:18.174
MASS IMMIGRATION RAIDS TARGETING

06:38:18.241 --> 06:38:19.609

PROTECTIONS OF CIVIL LIBERTIES

06:38:23.379 --> 06:38:25.982
AND HUMAN DIGNITY. WE MUST STAND

06:38:26.048 --> 06:38:28.251
FIRM IN OUR COMMITMENT TO

06:38:28.317 --> 06:38:30.052
CONSTITUTIONAL AND HUMAN RIGHTS,

06:38:30.119 --> 06:38:32.888
AND CLEARLY OPPOSE PRESIDENT

06:38:32.955 --> 06:38:35.091
TRUMP'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL

06:38:35.157 --> 06:38:37.593
ACTIONS. THIS ADMINISTRATION MAY

06:38:37.660 --> 06:38:39.028
CLAIM THAT THESE RAIDS ARE ABOUT

06:38:39.095 --> 06:38:41.163
ROOTING OUT VIOLENT CRIMINALS,

06:38:41.230 --> 06:38:43.666
BUT WE KNOW BETTER. MAKE NO

06:38:43.733 --> 06:38:45.368
MISTAKE TARGETING PEOPLE IN

06:38:45.434 --> 06:38:47.970
THEIR WORKPLACES, CHASING PEOPLE

06:38:48.037 --> 06:38:49.872
THROUGH THE FIELDS OF

06:38:49.939 --> 06:38:51.240
CALIFORNIA'S FRUITS AND

06:38:51.307 --> 06:38:54.110
VEGETABLE FIELDS, DEPLOYING THE

06:38:54.176 --> 06:38:56.312
NATIONAL GUARD ON PROTESTING

06:38:56.379 --> 06:38:59.448
CITIZENS DOES NOTHING BUT EXUDE

06:38:59.515 --> 06:39:02.418
LAWLESSNESS AND CHAOS. PRESIDENT

06:39:02.485 --> 06:39:06.055
TRUMP HAS MADE CLEAR NO PLACE IS

06:39:06.122 --> 06:39:08.591
SAFE FROM HIS CRUEL MASS, AND

06:39:08.658 --> 06:39:11.761
MANY TIMES ILLEGAL DEPORTATIONS,

06:39:11.827 --> 06:39:14.397
AND THAT HE WILL NOT STOP THE

06:39:14.463 --> 06:39:16.799
FACT THAT THERE IS A QUOTA. A

06:39:16.866 --> 06:39:19.302
TARGET PUT ON PEOPLE IS INHUMANE

06:39:19.368 --> 06:39:22.938
AND DISRUPTIVE. COLLEAGUES, WE

06:39:23.005 --> 06:39:25.775
ARE HOME TO OVER 10.5 MILLION

06:39:25.841 --> 06:39:28.444
IMMIGRANTS WHO PAY $23 BILLION

06:39:28.511 --> 06:39:31.547
IN TAXES EACH YEAR. THEY ARE THE

06:39:31.614 --> 06:39:34.016
HEART OF OUR DIVERSE COMMUNITIES

06:39:34.083 --> 06:39:36.819
WHOSE INVALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS

06:39:36.886 --> 06:39:40.189
ARE VITAL TO KEY SECTORS.

06:39:40.256 --> 06:39:42.792
AGRICULTURE, HEALTH CARE, HOTELS

06:39:42.858 --> 06:39:45.227
AND RESTAURANTS, CHILD CARE AND

06:39:45.294 --> 06:39:47.730
CONSTRUCTION. AND YET, THE

06:39:47.797 --> 06:39:49.665
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FAILS TO

06:39:49.732 --> 06:39:52.902
RECOGNIZE THEM AS HUMAN BEINGS.

06:39:52.968 --> 06:39:53.903
CHILDREN HAVE NIGHTMARES

06:39:53.969 --> 06:39:55.705
THINKING ABOUT WHICH DAY THEY

06:39:55.771 --> 06:39:57.907
WILL NO LONGER SEE THEIR FATHER

06:39:57.973 --> 06:40:00.776
OR MOTHER. SOME PEOPLE MAY

06:40:00.843 --> 06:40:02.545
CHOOSE TO DISMISS THE

06:40:02.611 --> 06:40:03.979
CREDIBILITY OF THE TESTIMONIES

06:40:04.046 --> 06:40:06.082
AND THE REPORTS THAT WE'VE

06:40:06.148 --> 06:40:09.051
HEARD, BUT NOT ONE DAY GOES BY

06:40:09.118 --> 06:40:10.953
THAT VIOLENT INCIDENTS DON'T

06:40:11.020 --> 06:40:13.422
OCCUR. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR.

06:40:13.489 --> 06:40:15.057
NEXT, I HAVE TWO WITNESSES IN

WOULDN'T BE HERE IF IT WASN'T

06:48:21.009 --> 06:48:22.311
FOR HER, AND MANY OF US WOULDN'T

06:48:22.377 --> 06:48:23.879
BE HERE IF IT WASN'T FOR HER.

06:48:23.946 --> 06:48:26.081

COMMUNITY STRICKEN BY THESE FEAR

06:48:30.018 --> 06:48:31.320
AND THESE RAIDS. I'M

06:48:31.386 --> 06:48:32.688
WHOLEHEARTEDLY BEHIND THIS

06:48:32.754 --> 06:48:34.556
RESOLUTION, AND I WANT FOLKS TO

06:48:34.623 --> 06:48:36.525
REMEMBER THAT WE ARE A STATE OF

06:48:36.592 --> 06:48:38.193
DREAMERS. WE ARE A STATE OF

06:48:38.260 --> 06:48:39.962
DOERS. WE ARE A STATE OF

06:48:40.028 --> 06:48:41.263
DIGNITY. AND IN CALIFORNIA, WE

06:48:41.330 --> 06:48:43.799
DO NOT BUILD OUR FUTURE ON FEAR.

06:48:43.866 --> 06:48:45.667
WE BUILD OUR FUTURE ON OUR

06:48:45.734 --> 06:48:47.469
FAMILY, ON OUR WORK, ON OUR

06:48:47.536 --> 06:48:50.239
HOPE. AND WE AS A STATE, NEED TO

06:48:50.305 --> 06:48:51.640
CONTINUE TO DENOUNCE THESE MASS

06:48:51.707 --> 06:48:53.675
ILLEGAL RAIDS. AND WE HAVE TO

06:48:53.742 --> 06:48:55.744
CONDEMN ANY ACT THAT TEARS

06:48:55.811 --> 06:48:57.546
PARENTS FROM THEIR CHILDREN,

06:48:57.613 --> 06:49:00.115
THAT TEARS WORKERS FROM THEIR

06:49:00.182 --> 06:49:01.083
JOBS AND OUR NEIGHBORS FROM

06:49:01.149 --> 06:49:03.619
THEIR HOMES. THIS RESOLUTION IS

06:49:03.685 --> 06:49:06.521
MORE THAN WORDS. IT'S A STAND

06:49:06.588 --> 06:49:08.290
FOR HUMANITY. IT'S A STAND FOR

06:49:08.357 --> 06:49:10.259
COMPASSION, AND IT'S A STAND FOR

06:49:10.325 --> 06:49:12.294
JUSTICE AND FOR THE SOUL OF OUR

06:49:12.361 --> 06:49:14.196

THIS IS A COMMON SENSE PROPOSAL

06:55:11.620 --> 06:55:13.021
I WALKED TO A LOCAL SHOPPING

06:55:13.088 --> 06:55:14.689

06:55:15.924 --> 06:55:18.226
THAT MORNING. WHILE I WAS THERE,

06:55:18.293 --> 06:55:19.728
A BLACK DODGE CHARGER WITH

06:55:19.794 --> 06:55:21.263
TINTED WINDOWS PULLED IN. IT

06:55:21.329 --> 06:55:23.565
LOOKED SUSPICIOUS, SO I FOLLOWED

06:55:23.632 --> 06:55:25.734
IT AND SAW BARRICADES IN THE

06:55:25.800 --> 06:55:28.236
BACK SEAT. THIS WAS AN UNMARKED

06:55:28.303 --> 06:55:29.638
VEHICLE CLEARLY BEING USED TO

06:55:29.704 --> 06:55:31.373
DETAIN PEOPLE. WHEN I TRIED TO

06:55:31.439 --> 06:55:32.874
TAKE THE PHOTO OF THE LICENSE

06:55:32.941 --> 06:55:35.377
PLATE, THE DRIVER JUMPED OUT. HE

06:55:35.443 --> 06:55:37.445
WORE PLAIN CLOTHES, A TACTICAL

06:55:37.512 --> 06:55:39.614
VEST, A MASK OVER HIS FACE AND

06:55:39.681 --> 06:55:41.516
POINTED WHAT LOOKED LIKE A GUN

06:55:41.583 --> 06:55:42.417
AT ME. HE TOLD ME TO BACK AWAY

06:55:42.484 --> 06:55:44.352
FROM HIS VEHICLE, BUT GAVE NO

06:55:44.419 --> 06:55:46.254
NAME, NO BADGE AND NO

06:55:46.321 --> 06:55:47.922
EXPLANATION. HE ACTED WITH

06:55:47.989 --> 06:55:49.958
FORCE, BUT WITHOUT ANY

06:55:50.025 --> 06:55:51.559
ACCOUNTABILITY, AS IF HE COULD

06:55:51.626 --> 06:55:53.194
DO WHATEVER HE WANTED. THAT

06:55:53.261 --> 06:55:54.229
MOMENT WAS TERRIFYING. IT SHOULD

06:55:54.296 --> 06:55:58.266
NEVER HAPPEN TO ANYONE. SB 805

06:55:58.333 --> 06:56:00.201
THE NÃ VIGILANTES ACT EXPANDS

06:56:00.268 --> 06:56:01.503
LAWS AGAINST POLICE

06:56:01.569 --> 06:56:03.004
IMPERSONATION TO ADDRESS GROWING

06:56:03.071 --> 06:56:03.972
FEAR AND CONFUSION FROM

06:56:04.039 --> 06:56:07.208
AGGRESSIVE OPERATIONS AND RISING

06:56:07.275 --> 06:56:09.344
IMPERSONATION CASES. IT ENSURES

06:56:09.411 --> 06:56:11.546
ANYONE ACTING AS LAW ENFORCEMENT

06:56:11.613 --> 06:56:13.081
IDENTIFIES THEMSELVES AS

06:56:13.148 --> 06:56:15.884
FOLLOWS. CLEAR. FOLLOWS CLEAR.

06:56:15.950 --> 06:56:17.686
CLEAR RULES CREATE AN

06:56:17.752 --> 06:56:19.421
ACCOUNTABILITY WHERE THERE

06:56:19.487 --> 06:56:21.589
CURRENTLY IS NONE, FOR THE

06:56:21.656 --> 06:56:22.991
SAFETY AND DIGNITY AND THE

06:56:23.058 --> 06:56:24.926
DIGNITY OF EVERY CALIFORNIAN. I

06:56:24.993 --> 06:56:27.762
URGE YOU TO SUPPORT. THANK YOU.

06:56:27.829 --> 06:56:29.497
GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS

06:56:29.564 --> 06:56:30.598
JEANETTE. I'M THE DIRECTOR OF

06:56:30.665 --> 06:56:31.966
LITIGATION AND POLICY FOR THE

06:56:32.033 --> 06:56:33.535
COALITION FOR HUMANE IMMIGRANT

06:56:33.601 --> 06:56:35.470
RIGHTS, AND I'M ALSO HERE AS A

06:56:35.537 --> 06:56:37.005
STRONG SUPPORTER AND SPONSOR OF

06:56:37.072 --> 06:56:38.740
SB 805. I WANT TO THANK THE

06:56:38.807 --> 06:56:39.641
SENATOR FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON

06:56:39.708 --> 06:56:42.577
THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. SB 805

06:56:42.644 --> 06:56:43.912
WOULD REQUIRE FEDERAL LAW

06:56:43.978 --> 06:56:45.380
ENFORCEMENT AGENTS, AS WELL AS

06:56:45.447 --> 06:56:47.282
STATE AGENTS, TO WEAR UNIFORMS

06:56:47.349 --> 06:56:48.950
THAT PROPERLY IDENTIFY

06:56:49.017 --> 06:56:50.518
THEMSELVES AND ENSURE THAT WE

06:56:50.585 --> 06:56:51.920
KNOW WHAT AGENCIES THEY ARE

06:56:51.986 --> 06:56:53.955
AFFILIATED WITH. SB 805 IS A

06:56:54.022 --> 06:56:55.523
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT MEASURE DUE

06:56:55.590 --> 06:56:57.625
TO THE WARRANTLESS ARRESTS AND

06:56:57.692 --> 06:56:59.494
DETENTIONS, OFTEN BY MASKED

06:56:59.561 --> 06:57:00.829
INDIVIDUALS DRESSED IN MILITARY

06:57:00.895 --> 06:57:03.398

06:57:03.465 --> 06:57:04.866
INFORMATION, TARGETING

06:57:04.933 --> 06:57:05.900
INDIVIDUALS FOR ARREST AND

06:57:05.967 --> 06:57:07.802
DETENTION WITH NO REGARD TO DUE

06:57:07.869 --> 06:57:09.804
PROCESS. SIMPLY PUT, THESE RAIDS

06:57:09.871 --> 06:57:11.639
ARE MILITARIZED ENFORCEMENT

06:57:11.706 --> 06:57:13.441
ACTIONS WAGED AGAINST ALL

06:57:13.508 --> 06:57:14.909
CIVILIANS IN PLACES LIKE LOS

06:57:14.976 --> 06:57:18.480

FBI, DEA, HSI, CBP, WHILE

06:57:23.618 --> 06:57:24.819
FORTIFIED BY THE NATIONAL GUARD

06:57:24.886 --> 06:57:27.389
AND THE MARINES. LET'S BE CLEAR

06:57:27.455 --> 06:57:29.190
THERE ARE NO CHECKS AND BALANCES

06:57:29.257 --> 06:57:30.792
OR ANY OVERSIGHT OF THESE

06:57:30.859 --> 06:57:32.527
ACTIVITIES. AND WHEN INDIVIDUALS

06:57:32.594 --> 06:57:33.795
ASK WHY THEY ARE BEING DETAINED

06:57:33.862 --> 06:57:35.897
OR ARRESTED, THEIR QUESTIONS GO

06:57:35.964 --> 06:57:37.265
UNANSWERED. WE HAVE FAMILY

06:57:37.332 --> 06:57:38.666

THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE THAT ARE

ARRESTING THEM. YET ALL THESE

06:57:55.350 --> 06:57:56.684
PLEASE CONTINUE TO GO

06:57:56.751 --> 06:57:59.220
UNANSWERED. THESE ARRESTS AND

06:57:59.287 --> 06:58:00.155
DETENTIONS ARE IMPACTING

INDIVIDUALS WITH ALL TYPES OF

06:58:01.856 --> 06:58:03.124
IMMIGRATION STATUSES, INCLUDING

06:58:03.191 --> 06:58:05.160
U.S. CITIZENS. IN ONE INSTANCE,

06:58:05.226 --> 06:58:06.795
A YOUNG MAN WAS ATTACKED AND

06:58:06.861 --> 06:58:08.863
ARRESTED BY MASKED MEN NEAR HIS

WITHOUT ANY IDENTIFYING

06:58:12.867 --> 06:58:14.602
INFORMATION. OUR ORGANIZATION

06:58:14.669 --> 06:58:16.271
WORKED WITH SEVERAL MEMBERS OF

06:58:16.337 --> 06:58:17.305
CONGRESS AND THIS YOUNG MAN'S

06:58:17.372 --> 06:58:19.340
MOTHER TO TRY TO LOCATE HIM. IT

06:58:19.407 --> 06:58:21.276
TOOK US OVER THREE DAYS TO FIND

06:58:21.342 --> 06:58:23.311
WHERE HE WAS BEING DETAINED.

06:58:23.378 --> 06:58:24.813
SIMILARLY, I SPOKEN TO AN

06:58:24.879 --> 06:58:26.514
INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS ARRESTED ON

06:58:26.581 --> 06:58:28.783
ONE OF THE FIRST RAIDS ON THAT

06:58:28.850 --> 06:58:31.319
JUNE 6TH AT AMBIANCE, WHERE MEN

06:58:31.386 --> 06:58:32.921
AND MILITARY GEAR BLOCKED ALL

06:58:32.987 --> 06:58:34.556
THE ENTRANCES AND ARRESTED AND

06:58:34.622 --> 06:58:36.324
DETAINED INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT ANY

06:58:36.391 --> 06:58:38.460
JUDICIAL WARRANTS TARGETING

06:58:38.526 --> 06:58:39.861

WORKERS AND SEGREGATING THEM FOR

06:58:42.297 --> 06:58:44.632
ARREST. WHEN HE PRESENTED THE

06:58:44.699 --> 06:58:46.568
AGENTS WITH A RED CARD OR A CARD

06:58:46.634 --> 06:58:48.937
THAT SAYS, I REFUSE TO SPEAK TO

06:58:49.003 --> 06:58:50.138
YOU UNTIL I HAVE MY IMMIGRATION

06:58:50.205 --> 06:58:50.738
ATTORNEY PRESENT, THEY JUST

06:58:50.805 --> 06:58:52.273
LAUGHED AT HIM AND TOLD HIM, YOU

06:58:52.340 --> 06:58:54.309
HAVE NO RIGHTS. HE HAD NO IDEA

06:58:54.375 --> 06:58:56.077
WHO THESE MASKED MEN WERE AND

06:58:56.144 --> 06:58:57.912
WHY THEY WERE POINTING MILITARY,

06:58:57.979 --> 06:58:59.314
WHY THEY WERE DRESSED IN

06:58:59.380 --> 06:59:00.648
MILITARY GEAR AND POINTING

06:59:00.715 --> 06:59:02.884
WEAPONS AT HIM. IN MY ALMOST 30

06:59:02.951 --> 06:59:04.252
YEARS OF PRACTICE AS AN

06:59:04.319 --> 06:59:05.520
IMMIGRATION LAWYER, I HAVE NEVER

06:59:05.587 --> 06:59:07.288
SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. WHILE

06:59:07.355 --> 06:59:08.690
THIS ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO

06:59:08.756 --> 06:59:10.458
DISTRACT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC

06:59:10.525 --> 06:59:12.627
ABOUT THE NEED TO PROTECT

06:59:12.694 --> 06:59:14.095
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT AGENTS,

06:59:14.162 --> 06:59:16.264
VIOLENCE IS CONTINUALLY BEING

06:59:16.331 --> 06:59:17.665
WAGED AGAINST OUR COMMUNITY

06:59:17.732 --> 06:59:20.235
MEMBERS, AND THIS ADMINISTRATION

06:59:20.301 --> 06:59:21.402
WILL CONTINUE TO TEST HOW FAR

06:59:21.469 --> 06:59:23.371
THEY CAN GO. THIS IS AN

06:59:23.438 --> 06:59:24.506
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT MEASURE, AND

06:59:24.572 --> 06:59:28.176
WE NEED TO PASS THIS LEGISLATION

06:59:28.243 --> 06:59:29.577
TODAY. ONE OF THE THINGS I DO

06:59:29.644 --> 06:59:32.547
WANT TO RAISE IS THAT THE STATE

06:59:32.614 --> 06:59:33.414
OF CALIFORNIA HAS A REALLY BIG

06:59:33.481 --> 06:59:34.582
INTEREST HERE IN ENSURING THAT

06:59:34.649 --> 06:59:36.518
WE KNOW WHO THESE INDIVIDUALS

06:59:36.584 --> 06:59:38.486
ARE. WE SPENT SO MANY YEARS AS A

06:59:38.553 --> 06:59:40.355
STATE ENSURING THAT LAW

06:59:40.421 --> 06:59:41.422
ENFORCEMENT AND IMMIGRANT

06:59:41.489 --> 06:59:42.156
COMMUNITIES, THAT IMMIGRANT

06:59:42.223 --> 06:59:43.625
COMMUNITIES CAN TRUST LAW

06:59:43.691 --> 06:59:45.026
ENFORCEMENT ENTITIES. AND MY

06:59:45.093 --> 06:59:47.896
CONCERN IS THAT ALL OF THIS

06:59:47.962 --> 06:59:48.496
TRUST IS BEING ERODED AS WE

06:59:48.563 --> 06:59:50.198
SPEAK. SO FOR THESE REASONS, I

06:59:50.265 --> 06:59:51.900
URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR SB 805.

06:59:51.966 --> 06:59:53.635

07:02:10.605 --> 07:02:13.274
BALANCE BETWEEN CONTINUING TO

07:02:13.341 --> 07:02:15.009

07:02:16.344 --> 07:02:17.445

DETAINED. WHERE WERE THEY FOUND?

07:03:24.579 --> 07:03:25.713
THEY WERE FOUND IN FEDERAL

07:03:25.780 --> 07:03:27.482
CUSTODY. BUT IT DID TAKE US

07:03:27.548 --> 07:03:28.716
SEVERAL DAYS TO FIND THEM. AND

07:03:28.783 --> 07:03:30.384

SOMETHING THAT IS RECOGNIZED BY

07:04:02.483 --> 07:04:04.018
SEVERAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT WORK

YEARS, BUT NO AGENCY RECOGNIZES

07:04:10.124 --> 07:04:11.859
THOSE YET. I DON'T KNOW IF ANY

07:04:11.926 --> 07:04:13.194
AGENCIES RECOGNIZE THEM, BUT

07:04:13.261 --> 07:04:15.196
PEOPLE DEFINITELY USE THEM WHEN

07:04:15.263 --> 07:04:16.597
THEY ARE CONFRONTED WITH

07:04:16.664 --> 07:04:18.599
IMMIGRATION OFFICERS. YOU'RE

07:04:18.666 --> 07:04:20.101
BASICALLY SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE

07:04:20.168 --> 07:04:22.336

BY ANY SORT OF AGENCY. BUT WHAT

IS RECOGNIZED IS THE

07:04:34.615 --> 07:04:35.917
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO REMAIN

07:04:39.353 --> 07:04:41.322
DIFFERENT LANGUAGES, SPANISH,

07:04:41.389 --> 07:04:42.690
CHINESE, TO ENSURE PEOPLE ARE

07:04:42.757 --> 07:04:46.027

NOT GOING TO BE VOTING FOR THIS.

07:04:52.934 --> 07:04:56.037
SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF THOSE ARE

07:04:56.103 --> 07:04:57.238

07:05:06.380 --> 07:05:08.382
AUTHOR AND THANK THE WITNESSES.

07:05:08.449 --> 07:05:09.183

07:05:09.250 --> 07:05:10.585

07:05:10.651 --> 07:05:12.019
AGREEMENT, FROM WHAT I

07:05:12.086 --> 07:05:13.588
UNDERSTAND IN THE LAST COUPLE OF

07:05:13.654 --> 07:05:14.922
HOURS. SO THANK YOU TO THE

07:05:14.989 --> 07:05:16.057
AUTHOR FOR THAT. LOOK, JUST

07:05:16.123 --> 07:05:17.692
REINSTATING RESTATING IN

07:05:17.758 --> 07:05:18.793
CALIFORNIA, WE BELIEVE SAFETY

07:05:18.860 --> 07:05:20.528
COMES WITH TRANSPARENCY AND NOT

07:05:20.595 --> 07:05:22.897
FEAR. OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE THE

07:05:22.964 --> 07:05:24.565
RIGHT TO KNOW WHO IS KNOCKING AT

07:05:24.632 --> 07:05:26.467
THEIR DOOR. OR IN THIS CASE,

07:05:26.534 --> 07:05:28.536
LET'S BE REAL, WHO THE RIGHT TO

07:05:28.603 --> 07:05:30.104
KNOW THEIR WHO THEIR IDENTIFY,

07:05:30.171 --> 07:05:31.772
WHO THEIR KIDNAPER IS, WHO THE

07:05:31.839 --> 07:05:32.940
ICE AGENT IS THAT'S BREAKING

07:05:33.007 --> 07:05:34.709
INTO THEIR CAR, OR GRABBING

07:05:34.775 --> 07:05:36.043
INDIVIDUALS AT A ROUTINE DOCTOR

07:05:36.110 --> 07:05:37.044
APPOINTMENT OR SIMPLY GETTING

07:05:37.111 --> 07:05:40.014
THEIR CAR WASHED. WE RESPECT LAW

07:05:40.081 --> 07:05:41.515
ENFORCEMENT, BUT RESPECT AND

07:05:41.582 --> 07:05:43.284
TRUST BEGINS WITH

07:05:43.351 --> 07:05:45.519
ACCOUNTABILITY. SB 805 IS ABOUT

07:05:45.586 --> 07:05:46.654
MAKING SURE THAT NO ONE, NOT

07:05:46.721 --> 07:05:48.356
EVEN FEDERAL AGENTS, CAN OPERATE

07:05:48.422 --> 07:05:50.424
IN SILENCE OR SECRECY BECAUSE

07:05:50.491 --> 07:05:52.660
TRUST IS EARNED IN LIGHT, NOT

07:05:52.727 --> 07:05:54.528
HIDDEN BEHIND A MASK, OR

07:05:54.595 --> 07:05:56.230
DISPLAYED BEHIND THEIR BADGE OF

07:05:56.297 --> 07:05:57.632
HONOR. AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF

07:05:57.698 --> 07:05:59.901
IT'S BEEN MOVED YET, BUT I'D

07:05:59.967 --> 07:06:01.502
LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL. WE'LL

07:06:01.569 --> 07:06:03.371
TREAT THAT AS A MOTION. IS THERE

07:06:03.437 --> 07:06:04.605
A SECOND, SECOND, SECOND BY

07:06:04.672 --> 07:06:06.540
RAMOS? OKAY. ANYTHING ELSE, MR.

07:06:06.607 --> 07:06:08.175
GONZALEZ? ALL RIGHT. WE'LL

07:06:08.242 --> 07:06:08.709
CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION.

07:06:08.776 --> 07:06:11.612
ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO WEIGH IN?

07:06:11.679 --> 07:06:13.080
OKAY. SENATOR PEREZ, WOULD YOU

07:06:13.147 --> 07:06:15.283
LIKE TO CLOSE? YEAH. WELL,

07:06:15.349 --> 07:06:17.251
AGAIN, JUST WANT TO THANK THIS

07:06:17.318 --> 07:06:19.020
COMMITTEE FOR ALL OF THEIR WORK

07:06:19.086 --> 07:06:20.354
ON THE AMENDMENTS. I KNOW, YOU

07:06:20.421 --> 07:06:21.689
KNOW, WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS

07:06:21.756 --> 07:06:23.591
UNTIL LATE IN THE EVENING. SO

07:06:23.658 --> 07:06:25.259
APPRECIATE THAT AND ALSO

07:06:25.326 --> 07:06:26.494
APPRECIATE THE FEEDBACK THAT

07:06:26.560 --> 07:06:28.562
WE'VE RECEIVED FROM LAW

07:06:28.629 --> 07:06:30.298
ENFORCEMENT. YOU KNOW, WHEN WE

07:06:30.364 --> 07:06:32.333
FIRST STARTED WORKING ON THIS

07:06:32.400 --> 07:06:34.302
BILL, IT ACTUALLY CAME AS AN

07:06:34.368 --> 07:06:35.436
INSPIRATION FOR MANY OF THE

07:06:35.503 --> 07:06:37.672
POLICE CHIEFS IN MY AREA WHO HAD

07:06:37.738 --> 07:06:40.174
RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THE FACT

07:06:40.241 --> 07:06:41.909
THAT THE FEDERAL AND IMMIGRATION

07:06:41.976 --> 07:06:43.744
ENFORCEMENT AGENTS ARE NOT DOING

07:06:43.811 --> 07:06:45.212
ANY SORT OF COORDINATION WITH

07:06:45.279 --> 07:06:46.814
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND THAT

07:06:46.881 --> 07:06:48.749
IS INHERENTLY PRESENTING A

07:06:48.816 --> 07:06:50.985
PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE FOR SMALL

07:06:51.052 --> 07:06:53.454
CITIES LIKE MINE. I REPRESENT 19

07:06:53.521 --> 07:06:55.089
CITIES IN THE SAN GABRIEL

07:06:55.156 --> 07:06:56.691
VALLEY. WE HAVE HAD INSTANCES

07:06:56.757 --> 07:06:58.693
LIKE WHAT YOU HEARD FROM MR.

07:06:58.759 --> 07:07:01.295
FRANCISCO CASTELLON TODAY. YOU

07:07:01.362 --> 07:07:03.864
KNOW, JUST THIS PAST WEEKEND, I

07:07:03.931 --> 07:07:06.801
WAS INFORMED THAT TWO STUDENTS,

07:07:06.867 --> 07:07:08.569
TWO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS

07:07:08.636 --> 07:07:10.104
ATTENDING SUMMER SCHOOL AT

07:07:10.171 --> 07:07:11.939
ALHAMBRA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT

07:07:12.006 --> 07:07:13.941
WERE PULLED ASIDE BY IMMIGRATION

07:07:14.008 --> 07:07:15.343
ENFORCEMENT AND QUESTIONED,

07:07:15.409 --> 07:07:17.144
ASKED FOR THEIR GREEN CARDS.

07:07:17.211 --> 07:07:18.980
THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT

07:07:19.046 --> 07:07:20.614
THAT MEANT BECAUSE THEY ARE HIGH

07:07:20.681 --> 07:07:21.949
SCHOOL KIDS, SO THEY PROVIDED

07:07:22.016 --> 07:07:24.352
THEIR STUDENT IDS. AFTER THAT,

07:07:24.418 --> 07:07:26.988
THE PEOPLE LEFT, BUT THEY DIDN'T

07:07:27.054 --> 07:07:28.356
PROVIDE ANY SORT OF

07:07:28.422 --> 07:07:29.757
IDENTIFICATION. WE HAVE NO IDEA

07:07:29.824 --> 07:07:31.325
WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE. I DON'T

07:07:31.392 --> 07:07:32.660
KNOW IF THEY WERE ICE

07:07:32.727 --> 07:07:34.862
IMPERSONATORS OR NOT, BUT THESE

07:07:34.929 --> 07:07:36.330
KIDS AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE NOW

07:07:36.397 --> 07:07:38.232
SO SCARED THAT THEY HAVE DROPPED

07:07:38.299 --> 07:07:40.267
OUT OF SUMMER SCHOOL. THESE ARE

07:07:40.334 --> 07:07:41.736
THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING. WE'VE

07:07:41.802 --> 07:07:44.538
HAD PUBLIC EVENTS, CITY EVENTS

07:07:44.605 --> 07:07:46.440
IN THE CITY OF PASADENA BE

07:07:46.507 --> 07:07:48.509
CANCELED WHEN THESE EVENTS TAKE

07:07:48.576 --> 07:07:51.078
PLACE. IT IS CREATED SO MUCH

07:07:51.145 --> 07:07:52.380
FRUSTRATION AND CHAOS FOR OUR

07:07:52.446 --> 07:07:55.416
LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AND I THINK

07:07:55.483 --> 07:07:58.252
FOR ALL OF US, REGARDLESS OF

07:07:58.319 --> 07:08:00.388
PARTY, WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT

07:08:00.454 --> 07:08:02.523
OUR COMMUNITIES ARE SAFE. WE

07:08:02.590 --> 07:08:04.792
WANT TO PREVENT CHAOTIC

07:08:04.859 --> 07:08:06.827
SITUATIONS LIKE THIS, AND WE

07:08:06.894 --> 07:08:09.063
UNDERSTAND THAT PROPER

07:08:09.130 --> 07:08:10.931
IDENTIFICATION, PROPER OVERSIGHT

07:08:10.998 --> 07:08:13.434
IS SO CRITICAL TO PUBLIC SAFETY.

07:08:13.501 --> 07:08:15.102
AND IT HAS BEEN SO HORRIFYING

07:08:15.169 --> 07:08:16.971
READING CASES ALL ACROSS THE

07:08:17.038 --> 07:08:19.040
COUNTRY OF PEOPLE IMPERSONATING

07:08:19.106 --> 07:08:21.275
ICE OFFICERS. IF PEOPLE

07:08:21.342 --> 07:08:22.977
IMPERSONATING POLICE OFFICERS

07:08:23.044 --> 07:08:24.512
WHO JUST HAD A CASE IN

07:08:24.578 --> 07:08:26.747
MINNESOTA, TWO PUBLIC OFFICIALS

07:08:26.814 --> 07:08:28.149
MURDERED BY SOMEBODY

07:08:28.215 --> 07:08:29.583
IMPERSONATING A POLICE OFFICER,

07:09:08.489 --> 07:09:09.590
BASIC PREMISE IN OUR JUSTICE

07:09:09.657 --> 07:09:11.192
SYSTEM THAT IF SOMEONE IS GOING

REPORTER WITH BUSINESS INSIDER.

07:18:15.168 --> 07:18:16.603
HE WAS ACTUALLY RECENTLY LAID

07:18:16.670 --> 07:18:18.872
OFF. BUT IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO

07:18:18.939 --> 07:18:20.374
LOOK INTO HIS WORK, HE'S AN

07:18:20.440 --> 07:18:21.608
INCREDIBLE WRITER AND

07:18:21.675 --> 07:18:23.877
JOURNALIST. AND THE

07:18:23.944 --> 07:18:24.945
INVESTIGATION HE DID WAS

07:18:25.012 --> 07:18:27.481
ACTUALLY INTO HIS OWN FORMER

07:18:27.547 --> 07:18:28.582
JOURNALISM TEACHER FROM WHEN HE

THAT'S HOW HE BEGAN IN COVERING

07:18:31.952 --> 07:18:35.389
THESE CASES. AND IT'S REALLY,

07:18:35.455 --> 07:18:37.357
REALLY POWERFUL TO JUST READ

07:18:37.424 --> 07:18:40.527
ABOUT HIS PROCESS OF HOW HE

CASES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND

07:18:44.364 --> 07:18:46.266
SO I WANT TO GIVE SO MUCH CREDIT

07:18:46.333 --> 07:18:48.101
TO HIM. BUT IT WAS THROUGH HIS

07:18:48.168 --> 07:18:49.403
WORK AND THE STORIES THAT HE

07:18:49.469 --> 07:18:51.705

SHARED THEIR STORIES. AND I'VE

07:18:54.841 --> 07:18:56.176
HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING SO

07:18:56.243 --> 07:18:58.979
MANY OF THEM WHO REALLY INSPIRED

07:18:59.046 --> 07:19:00.981
ME TO WANT TO TAKE ON THIS

07:19:01.048 --> 07:19:02.349
LEGISLATION. YOU KNOW, I WAS

07:19:02.416 --> 07:19:05.252

TELLING ME WHEN I WAS 17 YEARS

07:19:10.957 --> 07:19:13.060

07:19:13.126 --> 07:19:13.627
FEELINGS FOR ME AND HE WAS

07:19:13.694 --> 07:19:15.395
ALMOST 20 YEARS MY SENIOR. IT

07:19:15.462 --> 07:19:17.130
WAS A VERY SHOCKING EVENT.

07:19:17.197 --> 07:19:18.331
FORTUNATELY, I RAN AWAY BECAUSE

07:19:18.398 --> 07:19:20.067
I UNDERSTOOD THE INAPPROPRIATE

07:19:20.133 --> 07:19:21.768
NATURE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

07:19:21.835 --> 07:19:23.704
BUT I ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT

07:19:23.770 --> 07:19:24.671
HAPPENED TO OTHER CHILDREN THAT

07:19:24.738 --> 07:19:27.641
DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

07:19:27.708 --> 07:19:30.110

07:21:28.995 --> 07:21:30.664
PATTERN OF CONDUCT THAT PLACES

07:22:10.370 --> 07:22:12.072
COUNT WHEN ESTABLISHING A

07:22:12.138 --> 07:22:14.541
PATTERN OF STALKING. THREATS TO

07:22:14.608 --> 07:22:16.409
FAMILY MEMBERS ARE ALREADY

07:22:16.476 --> 07:22:18.979
COVERED. UNDER STATE LAW, SB 221

07:22:19.045 --> 07:22:21.514
WOULD SIMPLY UPDATE CALIFORNIA'S

07:22:21.581 --> 07:22:23.316
ANTI STALKING LAW BY ADDING

07:22:23.383 --> 07:22:27.153
THREATS TO PETS TO THE LIST OF

07:22:27.220 --> 07:22:28.588
BEHAVIORS USED TO ESTABLISH A

07:22:28.655 --> 07:22:30.423
PATTERN OF STALKING. THIS IS

07:22:30.490 --> 07:22:31.992
VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE, BECAUSE

07:22:32.058 --> 07:22:34.060
IT'S NOT ACTUALLY CHARGING

07:22:34.127 --> 07:22:35.962
SOMEONE WITH THREATENING A PET,

07:22:36.029 --> 07:22:37.964
BUT IT'S ADDING THE THREAT TO A

07:22:38.031 --> 07:22:40.533
PET TO A LIST OF BEHAVIORS USED

07:22:40.600 --> 07:22:42.102
TO ESTABLISH A PATTERN OF

07:22:42.168 --> 07:22:44.504
STALKING. JOINING ME TODAY ARE

07:22:44.571 --> 07:22:46.006
NICK SACKETT WITH THE SOCIAL

07:22:46.072 --> 07:22:47.807
COMPASSION IN LEGISLATION, AND

07:22:47.874 --> 07:22:49.075
ROBERT BROWN WITH THE CALIFORNIA

07:22:49.142 --> 07:22:52.812
DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION.

07:22:52.879 --> 07:22:55.081
THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON, CHAIR

07:22:55.148 --> 07:22:58.184
AND MEMBERS. OUR ORGANIZATION,

07:22:58.251 --> 07:22:59.920
SOCIAL COMPASSION IN

07:22:59.986 --> 07:23:01.788
LEGISLATION, ALONG WITH OVER 60

07:23:01.855 --> 07:23:03.156
OTHERS AND MORE THAN 400

07:23:03.223 --> 07:23:04.491
INDIVIDUALS, STRONGLY SUPPORT

07:23:04.557 --> 07:23:06.359
THIS BILL. WE DEEPLY UNDERSTAND

07:23:06.426 --> 07:23:08.461
THE POWERFUL BOND CALIFORNIANS

07:23:08.528 --> 07:23:10.063
SHARE WITH THEIR ANIMALS. EVERY

07:23:10.130 --> 07:23:12.332
DAY WE WITNESS THE EXTRAORDINARY

07:23:12.399 --> 07:23:13.633
EFFORTS PEOPLE MAKE TO PROTECT

07:23:13.700 --> 07:23:16.202
THEIR PETS THE COMFORT, JOY AND

07:23:16.269 --> 07:23:17.671
UNCONDITIONAL LOVE OUR ANIMALS

07:23:17.737 --> 07:23:21.241
PROVIDE IS TRULY UNIQUE, A 2024

07:23:21.308 --> 07:23:23.843
PEW RESEARCH POLL FOUND THAT 97%

07:23:23.910 --> 07:23:26.279
OF AMERICANS CONSIDER THEIR PET

07:23:26.346 --> 07:23:30.650
FAMILY, WITH 57% OF WOMEN AND

07:23:30.717 --> 07:23:32.619
64% OF LOWER INCOME INDIVIDUALS

07:23:32.686 --> 07:23:34.154
SAYING THEIR PETS ARE AS

07:23:34.220 --> 07:23:35.655
IMPORTANT AS HUMAN FAMILY

07:23:35.722 --> 07:23:38.925
MEMBERS. LEGALLY, ANIMALS MAY BE

07:23:38.992 --> 07:23:40.327
CONSIDERED PROPERTY, BUT THIS

07:23:40.393 --> 07:23:42.095
BILL ACKNOWLEDGES THE EMOTIONAL

07:23:42.162 --> 07:23:44.664
TRUTH WE ALL RECOGNIZE. IF YOUR

07:23:44.731 --> 07:23:46.733
LOVED ONE CAME TO YOU AND SAID

07:23:46.800 --> 07:23:48.935
THEIR EX WAS WILLFULLY AND

07:23:49.002 --> 07:23:50.770
REPEATEDLY HARASSING THEM AND

07:23:50.837 --> 07:23:52.572
MAKING CREDIBLE THREATS TO THEIR

07:23:52.639 --> 07:23:54.240
PET, WOULD YOU WANT TO TELL THEM

07:23:54.307 --> 07:23:56.109
THAT THAT BEHAVIOR ISN'T

07:23:56.176 --> 07:23:57.944
ILLEGAL, THAT NOTHING CAN BE

07:23:58.011 --> 07:23:59.346
DONE UNTIL THE ANIMAL IS

07:23:59.412 --> 07:24:01.781
ACTUALLY HARMED? TO US, THIS

07:24:01.848 --> 07:24:02.782
KIND OF CONDUCT SHOULD ALREADY

07:24:02.849 --> 07:24:05.185
BE A CRIME. WE RESPECTFULLY

07:24:05.251 --> 07:24:06.886
DISAGREE WITH THE OPPOSITION'S

07:24:06.953 --> 07:24:09.422
POSITION. THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT

07:24:09.489 --> 07:24:10.890
CRIMINALIZING INSENSITIVE

07:24:10.957 --> 07:24:12.959
BEHAVIOR. IT TARGETS A VERY

07:24:13.026 --> 07:24:15.962
SPECIFIC AND SERIOUS PATTERN

07:24:16.029 --> 07:24:17.764
MALICIOUS, WILLFUL, AND REPEATED

07:24:17.831 --> 07:24:18.932
HARASSMENT THAT INCLUDES

07:24:18.999 --> 07:24:20.266
CREDIBLE THREATS AGAINST THE

07:24:20.333 --> 07:24:22.002
VICTIM'S ANIMAL. THIS CONDUCT IS

07:24:22.068 --> 07:24:24.537
NOT RELATIVELY MINOR. IT IS A

07:24:24.604 --> 07:24:26.072
CALCULATED AND TRAUMATIZING, AND

07:24:26.139 --> 07:24:27.841
IT EXPLOITS A KNOWN LEGAL

07:24:27.907 --> 07:24:29.909
LOOPHOLE. WE URGE THE COMMITTEE

07:24:29.976 --> 07:24:31.411
TO RECOGNIZE THAT THREATS TO OUR

07:24:31.478 --> 07:24:32.879
ANIMALS ARE THREATS TO OUR

07:24:32.946 --> 07:24:34.614
SAFETY AND WELL-BEING. THE LAW

07:24:34.681 --> 07:24:36.649
SHOULD REFLECT THIS REALITY. AND

07:24:36.716 --> 07:24:38.284
WITH THAT, I RESPECTFULLY ASK

07:24:38.351 --> 07:24:40.053
FOR YOUR VOTE. GOOD AFTERNOON,

07:24:40.120 --> 07:24:41.454
MR. CHAIR, AND MEMBERS OF THE

07:24:41.521 --> 07:24:42.622
COMMITTEE, ROBERT BROWN OF THE

07:24:42.689 --> 07:24:43.957
SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY DISTRICT

07:24:44.024 --> 07:24:45.191
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, AND ON BEHALF

07:24:45.258 --> 07:24:46.693
OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT

07:24:46.760 --> 07:24:47.560
ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION ON THIS

07:24:47.627 --> 07:24:49.362
BILL. I'M ALSO HERE ON BEHALF OF

07:24:49.429 --> 07:24:50.864
THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY DISTRICT

07:24:50.930 --> 07:24:52.165
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AS A COSPONSOR

07:24:52.232 --> 07:24:54.968
ON THE BILL. FORGIVE ME, I HAVE

07:24:55.035 --> 07:24:56.970
TO USE BEN FRANKLIN TO HELP ME

07:24:57.037 --> 07:24:58.271
WITH TECHNOLOGY HERE. STALKING

07:24:58.338 --> 07:24:59.739
IS A CRIME ABOUT CONTROL. A

07:24:59.806 --> 07:25:01.007
STALKER INAPPROPRIATELY FIXATES

07:25:01.074 --> 07:25:01.975
ON THE TARGET OF THEIR

07:25:02.042 --> 07:25:03.476
OBSESSION, DRIVEN BY AN IMAGINED

07:25:03.543 --> 07:25:05.278
LOVE AND FANTASIES OF A FUTURE

07:25:05.345 --> 07:25:06.713
TOGETHER. BUT WHEN THE STALKER

07:25:06.780 --> 07:25:07.881
REALIZES THAT THIS FUTURE ISN'T

07:25:07.947 --> 07:25:09.582
GOING TO HAPPEN, THEY ENTER A

07:25:09.649 --> 07:25:10.316
DEVALUATION STAGE WHERE THEY

07:25:10.383 --> 07:25:12.152
SEEK TO PUNISH AND ISOLATE. THE

07:25:12.218 --> 07:25:13.453
VICTIM MENTALITY IS, IF I CAN'T

07:25:13.520 --> 07:25:15.789
HAVE YOU, NO ONE CAN. SO STALKER

07:25:15.855 --> 07:25:17.590
SEEKS TO ROB THE VICTIM OF ANY

07:25:17.657 --> 07:25:18.625
COMFORT OR LOVE THAT COMES FROM

07:25:18.691 --> 07:25:20.994
ANYONE ELSE. WHO CAN WE TURN TO

07:25:21.061 --> 07:25:21.628
FOR UNCONDITIONAL LOVE? WHO IS

07:25:21.694 --> 07:25:23.430
ALWAYS HAPPY TO SEE US FIRST

07:25:23.496 --> 07:25:24.764
THING IN THE MORNING OR AFTER A

07:25:24.831 --> 07:25:26.499
LONG DAY AT WORK. OUR BELOVED

07:25:26.566 --> 07:25:27.434
ANIMAL COMPANIONS, OUR FURRY

07:25:27.500 --> 07:25:30.070
FAMILY MEMBERS. AND FOR THIS

07:25:30.136 --> 07:25:30.703
REASON, STALKERS OFTEN TARGET

07:25:30.770 --> 07:25:31.371
PETS OF THEIR VICTIMS. CONSIDER

07:25:31.438 --> 07:25:32.305
18 YEAR OLD BRIANNA FROM

07:25:32.372 --> 07:25:33.440
RIVERSIDE COUNTY. HER STALKER

07:25:33.506 --> 07:25:34.240
ENTERED THE DEVALUATION STAGE

07:25:34.307 --> 07:25:35.642
AND THREATENED TO TAKE HER

07:25:35.708 --> 07:25:36.943
BELOVED KITTEN, WALLY, AND SKIN

07:25:37.010 --> 07:25:38.945
HIM ALIVE. UNDER CURRENT LAW,

07:25:39.012 --> 07:25:39.979
THAT THREAT COULD NOT BE

07:25:40.046 --> 07:25:41.114
CONSIDERED PART OF STALKING

07:25:41.181 --> 07:25:42.549
BECAUSE WALLY IS A FURRY FAMILY

07:25:42.615 --> 07:25:44.484
MEMBER AND NOT A HUMAN FAMILY

07:25:44.551 --> 07:25:45.952
MEMBER. WALLY WAS. IF THE LAW

07:25:46.019 --> 07:25:47.654
HAD RECOGNIZED THIS STALKING,

07:25:47.720 --> 07:25:49.222
LAW ENFORCEMENT COULD HAVE

07:25:49.289 --> 07:25:50.623
INTERVENED. HER STORY COULD HAVE

07:25:50.690 --> 07:25:52.092
ENDED DIFFERENTLY. BUT IT

07:25:52.158 --> 07:25:52.725
DIDN'T, SIMPLY BECAUSE THE LAW

07:25:52.792 --> 07:25:54.928
DOES NOT RECOGNIZE PETS AND PC

07:25:54.994 --> 07:25:57.297
640 6.9 THAT DISTINCTION DIDN'T

07:25:57.363 --> 07:25:58.565
STOP WITH BRIANNA'S STALKER. A

07:25:58.631 --> 07:26:00.233
FEW DAYS LATER, HER SWEET KITTEN

07:26:00.300 --> 07:26:01.468
WALLY WAS KIDNAPED BY THE

07:26:01.534 --> 07:26:02.869
STALKER AND USED TO LURE BRIANNA

07:26:02.936 --> 07:26:05.371
TO A FIELD WHERE SHE FOUND HER

07:26:05.438 --> 07:26:06.406
BELOVED PET DEAD. SADLY, BRIANNA

07:26:06.473 --> 07:26:07.707
IS FAR FROM ALONE IN HER

07:26:07.774 --> 07:26:08.475
EXPERIENCE. UNDER THE CURRENT

07:26:08.541 --> 07:26:10.810
LAW, WE HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE

07:26:10.877 --> 07:26:11.744
ANIMAL IS TAKEN OR KILLED, I.E.

07:26:11.811 --> 07:26:13.413
THE ANIMAL IS VICTIMIZED, TO

07:26:13.480 --> 07:26:14.514
CONSIDER THE CONDUCT CRIMINAL,

07:26:14.581 --> 07:26:15.815
AND EVEN THEN IT'S DEFINED AS

07:26:15.882 --> 07:26:17.217
THEFT OR ANIMAL CRUELTY. LET'S

07:26:17.283 --> 07:26:20.320
CALL IT WHAT IT IS. IT SHOULD BE

07:26:20.386 --> 07:26:21.020
STALKING. LET'S RECOGNIZE THE

07:26:21.087 --> 07:26:22.255
CRIME AGAINST THE HUMAN HERE,

07:26:22.322 --> 07:26:24.524
AND LET'S NOT WAIT UNTIL A PET

07:26:24.591 --> 07:26:25.325
IS TAKEN OR KILLED. IN CASES

07:26:25.391 --> 07:26:26.593
LIKE BRIANNA'S, WE ARE MISSING A

07:26:26.659 --> 07:26:27.760
GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY TO INTERVENE

07:26:27.827 --> 07:26:29.562
BEFORE A TRAGEDY OCCURS. ALL IT

07:26:29.629 --> 07:26:31.364
TAKES TO CHANGE THAT IS THE

07:26:31.431 --> 07:26:33.366
RECOGNITION THAT PETS ARE LIKE

07:26:33.433 --> 07:26:34.200
FAMILY AND CAN BE EQUALLY

07:26:34.267 --> 07:26:35.969
EFFECTIVE. TOOL. TOOL STALKERS

07:26:36.035 --> 07:26:37.871
TO USE STALKERS USED TO TORMENT

07:26:37.937 --> 07:26:39.172
THEIR VICTIMS. WE RESPECTFULLY

07:26:39.239 --> 07:26:41.441
ASK FOR YOUR VOTE ON SB 221 TO

07:26:41.508 --> 07:26:42.609
GIVE PROTECTION TO THE MOST

07:26:42.675 --> 07:26:44.010
INNOCENT AND VULNERABLE VICTIMS

07:26:44.077 --> 07:26:44.811
OF STALKING BEHAVIOR, AND ENSURE

07:26:44.878 --> 07:26:46.279
THAT PERPETRATORS OF THIS CRIME

07:26:46.346 --> 07:26:47.614
ARE HELD FULLY RESPONSIBLE. AND

07:26:47.680 --> 07:26:50.183
ON A PERSONAL NOTE, I WOULD LIKE

07:26:50.250 --> 07:26:51.618
TO SAY THAT THIS KIND OF A CRIME

07:26:51.684 --> 07:26:53.653
HAS JUST BEEN DESCRIBED AS AN

07:26:53.720 --> 07:26:54.354
ABERRATION. IT IS NOT. IT

07:26:54.420 --> 07:26:55.555
DOESN'T TAKE VERY LONG AS A

07:26:55.622 --> 07:26:57.190
PROSECUTOR TO ENCOUNTER ONE OF

07:26:57.257 --> 07:26:58.925
THESE CASES. I HAVE SEEN

07:26:58.992 --> 07:26:59.792
MULTIPLE CASES WHERE A KITTEN OR

07:26:59.859 --> 07:27:02.028
A DOG OR A PUPPY HAS BEEN ABUSED

07:27:02.095 --> 07:27:04.564
OR THREATENED WITH ABUSE SO THAT

07:27:04.631 --> 07:27:06.266
THE STALKER CAN EXERT SOME SORT

07:27:06.332 --> 07:27:08.368
OF OBSESSIVE CONTROL OVER THE

07:27:08.434 --> 07:27:10.904
VICTIM IN THE CASE. I THINK MANY

07:27:10.970 --> 07:27:13.406
OF US ARE IN PUBLIC SERVICE

07:27:13.473 --> 07:27:14.374
BECAUSE WE DON'T LIKE BULLIES.

07:27:14.440 --> 07:27:15.208
I'VE HEARD THAT HERE TODAY MANY

07:27:15.275 --> 07:27:17.310
TIMES. I THINK THAT I'VE ALSO

07:27:17.377 --> 07:27:18.611
HEARD SOME WORDS OF WISDOM THAT

07:27:18.678 --> 07:27:21.314
NO ONE SHOULD LIVE IN FEAR. AND

07:27:21.381 --> 07:27:21.915
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT KIND OF

07:27:21.981 --> 07:27:23.550
THING THAT THIS BEHAVIOR

07:27:23.616 --> 07:27:26.186
INSTILLS IN THE VICTIM. AND SO I

07:27:26.252 --> 07:27:27.220
REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK

07:27:27.287 --> 07:27:28.454
YOU. WELL, THANK YOU, SENATOR,

07:27:28.521 --> 07:27:30.089
FOR THE PRESENTATION. THANK YOU

07:27:30.156 --> 07:27:32.492
TO BOTH OF OUR WITNESSES. VERY

07:27:32.559 --> 07:27:33.326
QUICK PROGRAMING NOTE WE'RE

07:27:33.393 --> 07:27:34.794
GOING TO PROCEED ON WITH THIS

07:27:34.861 --> 07:27:36.563
HEARING. WE ARE UNABLE TO USE

07:27:36.629 --> 07:27:37.830
THE ROOM ACROSS THE WAY.

07:27:37.897 --> 07:27:39.265
ASSEMBLY, JUDICIARY STILL GOING.

07:27:39.332 --> 07:27:41.100
SO WE ARE GOING TO FINISH THIS

07:27:41.167 --> 07:27:41.935
BILL TO MY COLLEAGUES. WE'RE

07:27:42.001 --> 07:27:43.469
THEN GOING TO DO CONSENT AND ADD

07:27:43.536 --> 07:27:45.438
ONS BECAUSE WE MAY BE LOSING

07:27:45.505 --> 07:27:47.207
MEMBERS FOR THE REST OF THE DAY.

07:27:47.273 --> 07:27:49.576
WE ARE THEN GOING TO HAVE TO

07:27:49.642 --> 07:27:50.443
STAND IN RECESS UNTIL WE GET

07:27:50.510 --> 07:27:51.711
THIS ROOM BACK, WHICH WILL BE

07:27:51.778 --> 07:27:53.379
UPON CONCLUSION OF VETERAN AND

07:27:53.446 --> 07:27:54.814
MILITARY, WHICH IS GOING TO BE

07:27:54.881 --> 07:27:55.415
ROUGHLY FIVE 5:30 P.M. SO IF

07:27:55.481 --> 07:27:57.584
YOU'RE HERE WAITING FOR ANY

07:27:57.650 --> 07:27:59.385
OTHER BILL, I AM VERY SORRY, BUT

07:27:59.452 --> 07:28:00.386
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BREAK

07:28:00.453 --> 07:28:02.322
AFTER THIS HEARING AND WAIT TO

07:28:02.388 --> 07:28:03.323
GET THE ROOM BACK. WITH THAT

07:28:03.389 --> 07:28:04.857
SAID, I'LL GO OVER ALL THAT

07:28:04.924 --> 07:28:06.559
AGAIN IN A FEW MINUTES. WE'RE

07:28:31.217 --> 07:28:33.486

MOTION AND A SECOND. WE'RE STILL

07:28:39.225 --> 07:28:40.526
GOING TO LET THEM TESTIFY, MR.

07:28:40.593 --> 07:28:42.428
VICE CHAIR. HE KNOWS THAT. I'M

07:28:42.495 --> 07:28:44.764
JUST GIVING HIM A HARD TIME. YOU

07:28:44.831 --> 07:28:45.465
GUYS WILL HAVE FIVE MINUTES. YOU

07:28:45.531 --> 07:28:48.201
KNOW THE DRILL. AND IF YOU'RE A.

07:28:48.268 --> 07:28:49.669
ME, TOO. FOR THIS BILL, IF YOU

07:28:49.736 --> 07:28:50.837
WANT TO START LINING UP WHILE

07:28:50.903 --> 07:28:51.804
THEY'RE TESTIFYING RIGHT AGAINST

07:28:51.871 --> 07:28:52.972
THAT WALL RIGHT THERE, WE'LL

07:28:53.039 --> 07:28:54.674
TAKE YOU RIGHT AFTER. GO AHEAD.

07:28:54.741 --> 07:28:55.942
CHAIR MEMBERS, MY NAME IS AUBREY

07:28:56.009 --> 07:28:57.610
RODRIGUEZ, AND I'M A LEGISLATIVE

07:28:57.677 --> 07:28:59.212
ADVOCATE WITH ACLU CALIFORNIA

07:28:59.279 --> 07:29:01.714
ACTION. OUR ORGANIZATION IS IN

07:29:01.781 --> 07:29:03.483
OPPOSITION TO SB 221, WHICH

07:29:03.549 --> 07:29:04.684
WOULD GREATLY EXPAND THE

07:29:04.751 --> 07:29:06.452
DEFINITION OF WHAT CONSTITUTES

07:29:06.519 --> 07:29:08.288
STALKING, A CRIME THAT CARRIES

07:29:08.354 --> 07:29:09.389
WITH IT A PUNISHMENT BETWEEN 1

07:29:09.455 --> 07:29:11.624
AND 5 YEARS IN PRISON. THE ACLU

07:29:11.691 --> 07:29:12.925
IS CONCERNED THAT BROADENING

07:29:12.992 --> 07:29:14.160
BROADENING THE LANGUAGE COULD

07:29:14.227 --> 07:29:16.162
LEAD TO THE CRIMINALIZATION OF

07:29:16.229 --> 07:29:17.930
ACTIONS THAT, WHILE INSENSITIVE

07:29:17.997 --> 07:29:20.433
OR UNWELCOME, DO NOT RISE TO THE

07:29:20.500 --> 07:29:22.335
LEVEL OF STALKING AND WARRANT

07:29:22.402 --> 07:29:23.736
IMPRISONMENT. CRIMINALIZING

07:29:23.803 --> 07:29:25.138
BEHAVIOR THAT IS INSENSITIVE IS

07:29:25.204 --> 07:29:26.906
NOT ONLY IMPRACTICAL, BUT

07:29:26.973 --> 07:29:30.310
DANGEROUS. CRIMINALIZATION.

07:29:30.376 --> 07:29:31.277
OVERCRIMINALIZATION EXACERBATES

07:29:31.344 --> 07:29:32.745
EXISTING RACIAL AND ECONOMIC

07:29:32.812 --> 07:29:33.446
DISPARITIES IN THE JUSTICE

07:29:33.513 --> 07:29:34.914
SYSTEM, WHILE ALSO

07:29:34.981 --> 07:29:36.282
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTING

07:29:36.349 --> 07:29:37.550
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE LOW INCOME

07:29:37.617 --> 07:29:39.352
AND UNABLE TO AFFORD LEGAL

07:29:39.419 --> 07:29:41.054
REPRESENTATION OR PAY FINES.

07:29:41.120 --> 07:29:42.855
THIS EXPANSION OF CRIMINAL

07:29:42.922 --> 07:29:44.757
ACTIVITY CAN ENSNARE INDIVIDUALS

07:29:44.824 --> 07:29:46.359
IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

07:29:46.426 --> 07:29:47.527
FOR RELATIVELY MINOR

07:29:47.593 --> 07:29:48.628
INFRACTIONS, LEADING TO LONG

07:29:48.695 --> 07:29:50.463
TERM CONSEQUENCES SUCH AS LOSS

07:29:50.530 --> 07:29:52.098
OF EMPLOYMENT, HOUSING, AND

07:29:52.165 --> 07:29:55.034
CIVIL LIBERTIES. AS ADVOCATES

07:29:55.101 --> 07:29:56.202
FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO DO NOT

07:29:56.269 --> 07:29:58.204
HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF ADDRESSING

07:29:58.271 --> 07:29:58.971
POLICYMAKERS DIRECTLY, WE ASK

07:29:59.038 --> 07:30:01.174
YOU TO BE MINDFUL OF THESE

07:30:01.240 --> 07:30:02.208
IMPACTS WHEN CONSIDERING

07:30:02.275 --> 07:30:03.743
LEGISLATION THAT SEEKS TO EXPAND

07:30:03.810 --> 07:30:05.144
CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR

07:30:05.211 --> 07:30:07.213
NONVIOLENT OFFENSES. LASTLY, IT

07:30:07.280 --> 07:30:08.848
IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT

07:30:08.915 --> 07:30:10.583
EXISTING LAW ALREADY PROVIDES

07:30:10.650 --> 07:30:11.617
PROTECTIONS TO ANIMALS UNDER THE

07:30:11.684 --> 07:30:13.386
ANIMAL CRUELTY LAWS AT THE STATE

07:30:13.453 --> 07:30:15.755
AND FEDERAL LEVEL. AND AS NOTED

07:30:15.822 --> 07:30:17.290
IN THE SENATE PUBLIC SAFETY

07:30:17.357 --> 07:30:19.492
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS, A PROSECUTOR

07:30:19.559 --> 07:30:21.627
CAN CURRENTLY ALREADY ARGUE THAT

07:30:21.694 --> 07:30:24.097
ANY PERSON WHO REASONABLY FEARS

07:30:24.163 --> 07:30:26.399
FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY IF THE

07:30:26.466 --> 07:30:27.867
PERPETRATOR WAS THREATENING A

07:30:27.934 --> 07:30:28.935
PERSON'S PET, IN ADDITION TO

07:30:29.001 --> 07:30:29.836
COMMITTING OTHER HARASSING OR

07:30:29.902 --> 07:30:31.170
THREATENING BEHAVIOR AGAINST

07:30:31.237 --> 07:30:34.240
THAT PERSON, CAN PROSECUTE THEM,

07:30:34.307 --> 07:30:36.409
WHICH IS WHY THE SENATE ANALYSIS

07:30:36.476 --> 07:30:37.977
DOES APTLY, STATE MAKES THIS

07:30:38.044 --> 07:30:40.113
BILL ENTIRELY UNNECESSARY. FOR

07:30:40.179 --> 07:30:41.814
THESE REASONS, WE DO URGE YOUR

07:30:41.881 --> 07:30:44.250
NO VOTE ON SB 221 AND

07:30:44.317 --> 07:30:44.884
RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL.

07:30:44.951 --> 07:30:48.354
THANK YOU. HELLO, MR. CHAIR AND

07:30:48.421 --> 07:30:49.822
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY

07:30:49.889 --> 07:30:50.656
NAME IS ELIZABETH KIM, THE

07:30:50.723 --> 07:30:52.592
POLICY DIRECTOR AT INITIATE

07:30:52.658 --> 07:30:54.594
JUSTICE. I'M A LAWYER. I SERVED

07:30:54.660 --> 07:30:56.295
AT THE DOJ AND AN EDUCATOR WHO

07:30:56.362 --> 07:30:57.563
HAS TAUGHT INSIDE LEVEL THREE

07:30:57.630 --> 07:30:59.165
AND FOUR CALIFORNIA STATE

07:30:59.232 --> 07:31:01.000
PRISONS. I'VE ALSO PERSONALLY

07:31:01.067 --> 07:31:03.836
WORKED ON DV CASES, AND I'VE

07:31:03.903 --> 07:31:05.004
PERSONALLY BEEN A VICTIM OF

07:31:05.071 --> 07:31:06.406
STALKING CASES MYSELF. AND I'M

07:31:06.472 --> 07:31:08.908
ALSO A PET PROUD PET OWNER, AND

07:31:08.975 --> 07:31:10.209
I UNDERSTAND THE EMOTIONAL HARM

07:31:10.276 --> 07:31:12.879
INVOLVED HERE. I'M HERE TODAY TO

07:31:12.945 --> 07:31:15.047
RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SB 221. I'M

07:31:15.114 --> 07:31:17.150
GOING TO GO OVER FOUR QUICK

07:31:17.216 --> 07:31:19.318
POINTS. THE FIRST, AS MY

07:31:19.385 --> 07:31:21.521
COLLEAGUE STATED, THE REDUNDANCY

07:31:21.587 --> 07:31:23.756
TOOLS ALREADY EXIST. WE ALREADY

07:31:23.823 --> 07:31:24.791
HAVE LAWS THAT PROTECT PEOPLE.

07:31:24.857 --> 07:31:27.193
IN THESE CASES. THE DVR CASES

07:31:27.260 --> 07:31:28.995
ALLOW FOR PETS TO BE INCLUDED IN

07:31:29.061 --> 07:31:31.297
PROTECTIVE ORDERS AND VANDALISM

07:31:31.364 --> 07:31:33.065
LAWS, AS WELL AS CURRENT

07:31:33.132 --> 07:31:33.833
STALKING STATUTES. THIS BILL

07:31:33.900 --> 07:31:36.536
DOES NOT FILL THAT GAP, NOR DOES

07:31:36.602 --> 07:31:39.539
IT PROVIDE CLARITY. THERE IS A

07:31:39.605 --> 07:31:40.873
LEGAL AMBIGUITY HERE, AND

07:31:40.940 --> 07:31:42.909
UNEQUAL ENFORCEMENT WOULD

07:31:42.975 --> 07:31:44.610
RESULT. SO WHAT COUNTS AS A

07:31:44.677 --> 07:31:45.678
CREDIBLE THREAT TO AN EMOTIONAL

07:31:45.745 --> 07:31:47.046
SUPPORT ANIMAL? THERE IS NO

07:31:47.113 --> 07:31:49.215
CLEAR STANDARD, SO WITHOUT

07:31:49.282 --> 07:31:50.516
DEFINITIONS, ENFORCEMENT WILL

07:31:50.583 --> 07:31:52.418
VARY WILDLY BY COUNTY, BY

07:31:52.485 --> 07:31:54.954
OFFICER, BY BIAS. THAT'S DUE

07:31:55.021 --> 07:31:56.456
PROCESS. THAT'S A DUE PROCESS

07:31:56.522 --> 07:31:58.090
PROBLEM AND A SET UP FOR UNEVEN

07:31:58.157 --> 07:31:59.992
JUSTICE. THIRDLY, THERE'S A

07:32:00.059 --> 07:32:02.462
FISCAL IMPACT WHERE THERE'S AN

07:32:02.528 --> 07:32:04.464
UNFUNDED MANDATE HERE. THIS BILL

07:32:04.530 --> 07:32:05.665
WOULD EXPAND THE STALKING

07:32:05.731 --> 07:32:07.233
STATUTE WITHOUT ADDING

07:32:07.300 --> 07:32:09.302
RESOURCES, CREATING AN UNFUNDED

07:32:09.368 --> 07:32:11.904
MANDATE. MY LEGAL EXPERIENCE HAS

07:32:11.971 --> 07:32:14.006
EXPOSED ME TO HOW THESE KINDS OF

07:32:14.073 --> 07:32:15.408
EXPANSIONS STRAIN OUR COURT

07:32:15.475 --> 07:32:17.276
SYSTEM AND PULL RESOURCES AWAY

07:32:17.343 --> 07:32:19.479
FROM HIGHER PRIORITY THREATS.

07:32:19.545 --> 07:32:20.813
LASTLY, THERE IS NO PROVEN

07:32:20.880 --> 07:32:22.415
SAFETY BENEFIT THAT'S PROVEN.

07:32:22.482 --> 07:32:24.150
THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF

07:32:24.217 --> 07:32:26.252
JUSTICE AND BUREAU OF JUSTICE

07:32:26.319 --> 07:32:27.653
STATISTICS HAVE SHOWN TIME AND

07:32:27.720 --> 07:32:30.089
TIME AGAIN, HARSHER PENALTIES DO

07:32:30.156 --> 07:32:32.725
NOT DETER CRIME. WHAT WE WOULD

07:32:32.792 --> 07:32:35.595
LIKE TO SEE IS SUPPORT SERVICES,

07:32:35.661 --> 07:32:36.929
CONSISTENCY AND ENFORCEMENT,

07:32:36.996 --> 07:32:38.865
TRAUMA INFORMED APPROACHES AND

07:32:38.931 --> 07:32:40.967
INVESTMENT INTO PREVENTING

07:32:41.033 --> 07:32:42.435
MEASURES SO THAT OUR PETS ARE

07:32:42.502 --> 07:32:44.470
SAFE. WHAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE ARE

07:32:44.537 --> 07:32:45.404
BETTER ALTERNATIVES, AND I'D

07:32:45.471 --> 07:32:47.874
LIKE TO CLOSE WITH THIS INSTEAD

07:32:47.940 --> 07:32:50.076
OF EXPANDING ON A DEFINITION OR

07:32:50.142 --> 07:32:51.511
A STATUTE, LET'S TRAIN AND WORK

07:32:51.577 --> 07:32:53.045
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT ON HOW TO

07:32:53.112 --> 07:32:54.647
USE THE TOOLS WE ALREADY HAVE.

07:32:54.714 --> 07:32:56.983
AND LET'S INVEST IN SERVICES FOR

07:32:57.049 --> 07:32:58.584
VICTIMS TO PREVENT THESE CRIMES

07:32:58.651 --> 07:33:00.086
FROM HAPPENING, NOT BUILD

07:33:00.152 --> 07:33:02.622
BROADER STATUTES WITH UNINTENDED

07:33:02.688 --> 07:33:03.523
CONSEQUENCES. AND AS SOMEONE

07:33:03.589 --> 07:33:04.991
WHO'S WORKED ON BOTH POLICY AND

07:33:05.057 --> 07:33:06.259
THE FRONTLINES AND WHO LOVE

07:33:06.325 --> 07:33:09.428
PETS, I URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON

07:33:09.495 --> 07:33:13.866
SB 221. THANK YOU. FIVE MINUTES.

07:33:13.933 --> 07:33:16.269
SURE ABOUT 30S, BUT GO FOR IT

07:33:16.335 --> 07:33:18.471
THEN. I JUST WANT TO SAY AND ON

07:33:18.538 --> 07:33:19.639
PAGE THREE OF THE ANALYSIS, IT

07:33:19.705 --> 07:33:21.607
DOES STATE IT IS ARGUABLE UNDER

07:33:21.674 --> 07:33:22.909
CALIFORNIA STATUTE THAT IF A

07:33:22.975 --> 07:33:24.710
PERSON THREATENS A PET WITH HARM

07:33:24.777 --> 07:33:26.045
AND MAY STILL CONSTITUTE

07:33:26.112 --> 07:33:27.513
STALKING BECAUSE THERE IS A

07:33:27.580 --> 07:33:28.648
CREDIBLE REASON TO THINK THE

07:33:28.714 --> 07:33:30.616
HARM WILL ESCALATE TO A PERSON,

07:33:30.683 --> 07:33:32.218
WHICH AGAIN MAKES THIS BILL

07:33:32.285 --> 07:33:33.753
UNNECESSARY. THANK YOU. THANK

07:33:33.819 --> 07:33:35.721
YOU BOTH VERY MUCH. ANY OTHER

07:33:35.788 --> 07:33:36.822
METOOS? ANYONE ELSE HOPING TO BE

07:33:36.889 --> 07:33:38.758
HEARD ON THE BILL? OKAY, WE'LL

07:33:38.824 --> 07:33:40.459
TURN IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE.

07:33:40.526 --> 07:33:41.427
WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A

07:33:41.494 --> 07:33:43.529
SECOND. I'LL JUST NOTE. ARE

07:33:43.596 --> 07:33:44.564
THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS

07:33:44.630 --> 07:33:45.831
FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS? I ONLY

07:33:45.898 --> 07:33:47.333
HAVE ONE QUESTION, I BELIEVE,

07:33:47.400 --> 07:33:49.368
MR. BROWN. CORRECT. FROM CDVA,

07:33:49.435 --> 07:33:50.770
YOU'VE HEARD THE SKEPTICISM THAT

07:33:50.836 --> 07:33:52.972
THE BILL IS UNNECESSARY AND

07:33:53.039 --> 07:33:55.107
DUPLICATIVE OF PREVIOUSLY STATED

07:33:55.174 --> 07:33:56.108
LAW. WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE?

07:33:56.175 --> 07:33:57.376
WHAT'S THE POSITION OF CDA?

07:33:57.443 --> 07:33:59.478
WELL, THEN I WONDER WHY THE

07:33:59.545 --> 07:34:00.947
OTHER ARGUMENTS ARE MADE IF

07:34:01.013 --> 07:34:01.514
THAT'S THE CASE. BUT I ALSO

07:34:01.581 --> 07:34:04.450
THINK THAT IF APPELLATE COURTS

07:34:04.517 --> 07:34:05.885
OFTEN LOOK TO THE PLAIN LANGUAGE

07:34:05.952 --> 07:34:08.120
OF A LAW, AND WHAT I HEARD MY

07:34:08.187 --> 07:34:10.690
COLLEAGUE HERE SAY IS THAT IT IS

07:34:10.756 --> 07:34:12.091
ARGUABLE THAT MEANS THERE IS

07:34:12.158 --> 07:34:13.326
AMBIGUITY THAT NEEDS TO BE

07:34:13.392 --> 07:34:14.794
RESOLVED THAT COULD BE PLACED IN

07:34:14.860 --> 07:34:17.663
FRONT OF A JURY, AND THEY WON'T

07:34:17.730 --> 07:34:19.699
KNOW THE ANSWER. IF YOU HAVE IT

07:34:19.765 --> 07:34:20.299
EXPLICITLY IN THE STATUTE, IT

07:34:20.366 --> 07:34:20.900
WILL REMOVE ANY QUESTION THAT

07:34:20.967 --> 07:34:23.302
THREATENING THE HARM TO THAT PET

THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WHO

08:04:10.154 --> 08:04:12.356
APPOINTED THEM THE AT WILL

08:04:12.423 --> 08:04:14.759
EMPLOYMENT STATUS THAT'S CURRENT

08:04:14.825 --> 08:04:17.428
STATE OF AFFAIRS HAS LED TO THE

08:04:17.495 --> 08:04:18.496
FEAR OF TERMINATION BY PUBLIC

08:04:18.562 --> 08:04:19.897
DEFENDERS, WHO HAVE TAKEN UP

08:04:19.964 --> 08:04:21.766
CONTROVERSIAL CAUSES WHICH CAN

08:04:21.832 --> 08:04:23.200
INTERFERE WITH THEIR ABILITY TO

08:04:23.267 --> 08:04:24.335
ADEQUATELY FIGHT FOR THEIR

08:04:24.402 --> 08:04:26.237
CLIENTS. CHIEF PUBLIC DEFENDERS

08:04:26.303 --> 08:04:28.105
PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN ENSURING

08:04:28.172 --> 08:04:29.707
A FAIR AND EQUITABLE JUSTICE

08:04:29.774 --> 08:04:31.142
SYSTEM. THEY UPHOLD THE

08:04:31.208 --> 08:04:32.243
CONSTITUTION BY GUARANTEEING

08:04:32.309 --> 08:04:33.677
ACCESS TO DUE PROCESS FOR ALL,

08:04:33.744 --> 08:04:35.479
REGARDLESS OF FINANCIAL STATUS,

08:04:35.546 --> 08:04:37.581
AND BY ELIMINATING THE AT WILL

08:04:37.648 --> 08:04:40.518
STATUS. OF THESE OFFICIALS, SB

08:04:40.584 --> 08:04:41.886

08:04:41.952 --> 08:04:43.120
INDEPENDENCE AND ALLOW THEM TO

08:04:43.187 --> 08:04:44.455
SERVE WITH INTEGRITY. I

08:04:44.522 --> 08:04:46.257
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE

08:04:46.323 --> 08:04:47.591
WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IS

08:04:47.658 --> 08:04:49.894
REBECCA MARCOS. REBECCA MARCUS.

08:04:49.960 --> 08:04:51.962
EXCUSE ME, FROM THE CALIFORNIA

08:04:52.029 --> 08:04:54.465
PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION.

08:04:54.532 --> 08:04:55.733
GOOD AFTERNOON, CHAIR MEMBERS.

08:04:55.800 --> 08:04:57.101
MY NAME IS REBECCA MARCUS, AND I

08:04:57.168 --> 08:04:58.502
REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC

08:04:58.569 --> 08:05:01.338
DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION. SB 485

08:05:01.405 --> 08:05:02.406
STRENGTHENS THE INTEGRITY OF

08:05:02.473 --> 08:05:03.607
PUBLIC DEFENSE BY PROTECTING

08:05:03.674 --> 08:05:04.542
PUBLIC DEFENDERS FROM

08:05:04.608 --> 08:05:06.343
POLITICALLY MOTIVATED DISMISSAL.

08:05:06.410 --> 08:05:07.812
PUBLIC DEFENDERS ARE ESSENTIAL

08:05:07.878 --> 08:05:09.580
TO A FUNCTIONING JUSTICE SYSTEM.

08:05:09.647 --> 08:05:11.081
THEY ENSURE THAT NO ONE FACES

08:05:11.148 --> 08:05:13.217
THE POWER OF THE STATE ALONE,

08:05:13.284 --> 08:05:14.285
THAT THE CONSTITUTION, THE

08:05:14.351 --> 08:05:15.319
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO COUNSEL,

08:05:15.386 --> 08:05:17.121
IS NOT JUST THEORETICAL, BUT

08:05:17.188 --> 08:05:18.556
REAL AND ACCESSIBLE. NO MATTER

08:05:18.622 --> 08:05:20.791
YOUR INCOME OR BACKGROUND. YET

08:05:20.858 --> 08:05:22.293
UNDER CURRENT LAW, IN MOST

08:05:22.359 --> 08:05:23.360
COUNTIES, PUBLIC DEFENDERS CAN

08:05:23.427 --> 08:05:25.429
BE FIRED AT WILL BY THE BOARD OF

08:05:25.496 --> 08:05:26.530
SUPERVISORS, EVEN FOR REASONS

08:05:26.597 --> 08:05:28.265
ENTIRELY UNRELATED TO MISCONDUCT

08:05:28.332 --> 08:05:30.201
OR POOR MANAGEMENT. THAT MEANS A

08:05:30.267 --> 08:05:31.836
PUBLIC DEFENDER CAN BE REMOVED

08:05:31.902 --> 08:05:33.137
SIMPLY BY STANDING UP TO LAW

08:05:33.204 --> 08:05:35.239
ENFORCEMENT ABUSES, DEFENDING AN

08:05:35.306 --> 08:05:36.941
UNPOPULAR CLIENT, OR CHALLENGING

08:05:37.007 --> 08:05:38.742
SYSTEMIC INJUSTICE EXACTLY WHAT

08:05:38.809 --> 08:05:40.077
WE EXPECT THEM TO DO AND WHAT

08:05:40.144 --> 08:05:42.079
THE CONSTITUTION DEMANDS. THIS

08:05:42.146 --> 08:05:43.414
BILL DOESN'T INSULATE DEFENDERS

08:05:43.481 --> 08:05:44.882
FROM ACCOUNTABILITY. IT SIMPLY

08:05:44.949 --> 08:05:46.217
REQUIRES THAT REMOVAL BE BASED

08:05:46.283 --> 08:05:48.118
ON GOOD CAUSE. THINGS LIKE

08:05:48.185 --> 08:05:49.987
MISCONDUCT, NEGLECT OF DUTY, OR

08:05:50.054 --> 08:05:51.755
ETHICAL VIOLATIONS, AND THAT THE

08:05:51.822 --> 08:05:53.224
DECISION BE MADE BY A 3/5 VOTE

08:05:53.290 --> 08:05:55.025
OF THE BOARD. NOW, IN MOST

08:05:55.092 --> 08:05:56.794
COUNTIES WITH FIVE SUPERVISORS,

08:05:56.861 --> 08:05:58.262
THAT'S JUST THREE VOTES, THE

08:05:58.329 --> 08:06:00.064
SAME AS A SIMPLE MAJORITY. BUT

08:06:00.130 --> 08:06:01.131
THE MEANINGFUL REFORM HERE IS

08:06:01.198 --> 08:06:03.300
THE REQUIREMENT THAT THERE BE A

08:06:03.367 --> 08:06:04.401
LEGITIMATE DOCUMENTED REASON FOR

08:06:04.468 --> 08:06:05.736
REMOVAL. THAT'S WHAT PROTECTS

08:06:05.803 --> 08:06:06.904
DEFENDERS FROM BEING OUSTED FOR

08:06:06.971 --> 08:06:08.706
DOING THEIR JOBS TOO. WELL, JUST

08:06:08.772 --> 08:06:11.242
IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS, I'VE BEEN

08:06:11.308 --> 08:06:11.909
CONFRONTED WITH TWO EXAMPLES AS

08:06:11.976 --> 08:06:13.277
TO WHY THIS BILL MUST PASS. TWO

08:06:13.344 --> 08:06:14.678
DIFFERENT PUBLIC DEFENDERS

08:06:14.745 --> 08:06:16.447
OFFICES CAME TO OUR ASSOCIATION

08:06:16.514 --> 08:06:17.748
LOOKING FOR ADVICE ON HOW TO

08:06:17.815 --> 08:06:19.350
NAVIGATE PRECARIOUS SITUATIONS

08:06:19.416 --> 08:06:20.784
WITH THEIR BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS

08:06:20.851 --> 08:06:22.019
AND ELECTED LAW ENFORCEMENT

08:06:22.086 --> 08:06:23.153
TRYING TO BALANCE THEIR

08:06:23.220 --> 08:06:24.221
CONSTITUTIONAL DUTIES TO

08:06:24.288 --> 08:06:24.989
ADVOCATE FOR THEIR CLIENTS WITH

08:06:25.055 --> 08:06:27.691
THE REAL FEAR OF RETALIATION,

08:06:27.758 --> 08:06:29.627
DISCUSSING MENTAL HEALTH

08:06:29.693 --> 08:06:32.329
DIVERSION OR ICE RAIDS AT

08:06:32.396 --> 08:06:33.964
COURTHOUSES PUT THEM AT ODDS

08:06:34.031 --> 08:06:35.533
WITH THEIR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS.

08:06:35.599 --> 08:06:37.568
AT A TIME WHEN WE'RE SEEING

08:06:37.635 --> 08:06:38.168
POLITICALLY MOTIVATED FIRINGS

08:06:38.235 --> 08:06:39.937
AND PUBLIC OFFICIALS ACROSS THE

08:06:40.004 --> 08:06:41.438
COUNTRY. CALIFORNIA MUST LEAD IN

08:06:41.505 --> 08:06:42.473
AFFIRMING THE INDEPENDENCE OF

08:06:42.540 --> 08:06:43.941
THOSE WHO SERVE THE MOST

08:06:44.008 --> 08:06:45.009
VULNERABLE IN OUR COURTS. WHEN

08:06:45.075 --> 08:06:46.510
WE PROTECT PUBLIC DEFENDERS, WE

08:06:46.577 --> 08:06:47.978
PROTECT THE RIGHT TO A FAIR

08:06:48.045 --> 08:06:49.346
TRIAL. WE PROTECT THE

08:06:49.413 --> 08:06:50.414
CONSTITUTION, AND WE PROTECT

08:06:50.481 --> 08:06:51.882
PUBLIC TRUST IN THE IDEA THAT

08:06:51.949 --> 08:06:53.751
JUSTICE DOES NOT DEPEND ON YOUR

08:06:53.817 --> 08:06:55.452
INCOME OR YOUR POLITICS. WE URGE

08:06:55.519 --> 08:06:58.088
YOUR SUPPORT FOR SB 485. THANK

ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES, ALSO ON

BEHALF OF THE URBAN COUNTIES OF

CALIFORNIA AND THE RURAL COUNTY

08:08:09.093 --> 08:08:10.394
REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA

08:08:10.461 --> 08:08:12.029
HERE IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO

08:08:12.096 --> 08:08:14.965
SB 485. I KNOW IT'S BEEN A LONG

08:08:15.032 --> 08:08:17.568
DAY, SO I'LL KEEP IT UNDER FIVE

08:08:17.635 --> 08:08:20.070
MINUTES. EXCUSE ME, BUT FIRST, I

08:08:20.137 --> 08:08:21.739
THINK WE'D LIKE TO MAKE IT CLEAR

08:08:21.805 --> 08:08:23.307
THAT OUR POSITION IS ROOTED IN

08:08:23.374 --> 08:08:25.442
PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNANCE, GOOD

08:08:25.509 --> 08:08:26.877
GOVERNANCE, ORGANIZATIONAL

08:08:26.944 --> 08:08:29.079
CONSISTENCY AND PROCESS CLARITY.

08:08:29.146 --> 08:08:30.447
IT IS NOT ABOUT PUBLIC

08:08:30.514 --> 08:08:31.582
DEFENDERS, RATHER, IT'S ABOUT

08:08:31.649 --> 08:08:33.050
ANY NON-ELECTED, APPOINTED

08:08:33.117 --> 08:08:34.318
DEPARTMENT HEAD THAT SERVES

08:08:34.385 --> 08:08:36.220
UNDER OUR 296 COUNTY BOARDS OF

08:08:36.286 --> 08:08:38.088
SUPERVISORS THAT ARE ELECTED

08:08:38.155 --> 08:08:39.423
SECOND. IN OUR VIEW, IT'S STILL

08:08:39.490 --> 08:08:40.858
RATHER UNCLEAR AS THE TRUE

08:08:40.924 --> 08:08:43.127
NECESSITY OF THIS BILL. SPEAKING

08:08:43.193 --> 08:08:44.495
WITH COUNTY COUNCILS, THERE ARE

08:08:44.561 --> 08:08:46.296
VERY FEW EXAMPLES TO EVEN DRAW

08:08:46.363 --> 08:08:47.665
FROM WHERE THE AT-WILL BOARD

08:08:47.731 --> 08:08:49.233
AUTHORITY TO REMOVE PUBLIC

08:08:49.299 --> 08:08:50.668
DEFENDER WAS EXERCISED, AS WAS

08:08:50.734 --> 08:08:52.770
ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE AUTHORS

08:08:52.836 --> 08:08:54.171
OFFICE, AND WAS NOTED IN THE

08:08:54.238 --> 08:08:58.108
COMMITTEE. ANALYSIS. THE MOST

08:08:58.175 --> 08:09:00.377
RECENT EXAMPLE PROVIDED WAS BACK

08:09:00.444 --> 08:09:02.846
IN 1999, IN WHICH THE REMOVAL OF

08:09:02.913 --> 08:09:03.981
OFFICE WAS HANDLED LIKE ANY

08:09:04.048 --> 08:09:06.417
OTHER HIGH PROFILE EMPLOYMENT

08:09:06.483 --> 08:09:08.485
ACTION. THERE WAS ALLEGATIONS OF

08:09:08.552 --> 08:09:10.187
MISCONDUCT AND AN INVESTIGATION

08:09:10.254 --> 08:09:11.955
COMMENCED WHICH ULTIMATELY

08:09:12.022 --> 08:09:13.223
DEMONSTRATED THE ALLEGATIONS AS

08:09:13.290 --> 08:09:14.525
IT RELATES TO ETHICAL CONCERNS

08:09:14.591 --> 08:09:16.460
WERE WELL FOUNDED. THE POINT

08:09:16.527 --> 08:09:17.861
HERE IS THAT DESPITE EXISTING

08:09:17.928 --> 08:09:19.697
LAW ESTABLISHING AT-WILL STATUS

08:09:19.763 --> 08:09:21.565
OR TERMINATION FOR ANY REASON,

08:09:21.632 --> 08:09:23.500
THERE IS STILL A REMOVAL PROCESS

08:09:23.567 --> 08:09:25.502
IN PLACE, BACKED BY SOME

08:09:25.569 --> 08:09:26.670
INVESTIGATION AND DELIBERATE

08:09:26.737 --> 08:09:28.739
CONSIDERATION BY THE FULL BOARD

08:09:28.806 --> 08:09:31.375
PRIOR TO ANY BOARD ACTION. THAT

08:09:31.442 --> 08:09:33.010
SAID, THIS IS THE REASON WHY

08:09:33.077 --> 08:09:33.844
WE'RE NOT OPPOSING SOLELY BASED

08:09:33.911 --> 08:09:35.546
ON THE ELEVATED EMPLOYMENT

08:09:35.612 --> 08:09:36.880
PROTECTIONS OR THE DESIRE FOR

08:09:36.947 --> 08:09:38.782
FULL INDEPENDENCE, BUT INSTEAD

08:09:38.849 --> 08:09:39.950
PROPOSING, IN OUR VIEW,

08:09:40.017 --> 08:09:41.351
REASONABLE AMENDMENTS THAT

08:09:41.418 --> 08:09:43.087
PROVIDE ESSENTIAL CHECKS AND

08:09:43.153 --> 08:09:47.925
BALANCES. ACCORDING TO OUR TO

08:09:47.991 --> 08:09:49.259
THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS, THIS

08:09:49.326 --> 08:09:51.595
MEASURE WAS, AT LEAST IN PART,

08:09:51.662 --> 08:09:52.229
DESIGNED TO CREATE PARITY WITH

08:09:52.296 --> 08:09:53.263
EMPLOYMENT PROTECTIONS FOR

08:09:53.330 --> 08:09:55.599
COUNTY COUNCILS, AND LANGUAGE

08:09:55.666 --> 08:09:57.568
WAS DRAFTED AS SUCH, RELYING ON

08:09:57.634 --> 08:09:58.635
SPECIFIC PROVISIONS OF THE

08:09:58.702 --> 08:10:00.471
GOVERNMENT CODE FOR COUNTY

08:10:00.537 --> 08:10:02.573
COUNCIL. HOWEVER, A CRITICALLY

08:10:02.639 --> 08:10:03.907
IMPORTANT PROVISION THAT WAS

08:10:03.974 --> 08:10:06.176
OMITTED IN SB 45 WAS THE

08:10:06.243 --> 08:10:07.311
ESTABLISHMENT OF A FOUR YEAR

08:10:07.377 --> 08:10:08.912
TERM, AS IS THE CASE FOR COUNTY

08:10:08.979 --> 08:10:10.881
COUNCIL, IF THE EMPLOYMENT

08:10:10.948 --> 08:10:12.449
STATUS IS BEING CHANGED FROM

08:10:12.516 --> 08:10:14.118
AT-WILL TO ONE, IN WHICH REMOVAL

08:19:12.122 --> 08:19:13.490

AMENDMENTS. MISTER CHAIR,

08:19:23.900 --> 08:19:24.901
COMMITTEE MEMBERS, WE'VE BEEN

08:19:24.968 --> 08:19:26.736
WORKING REALLY HARD ON THIS BILL

08:19:26.803 --> 08:19:27.370
THAT I'M SUPER PASSIONATE ABOUT

08:19:27.437 --> 08:19:29.205
BECAUSE IT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN

08:19:29.272 --> 08:19:31.408
MY BACKYARD AND IT'S A VERY

08:19:31.474 --> 08:19:34.711
COUNTY SPECIFIC DISTRICT. SB 357

08:19:34.778 --> 08:19:35.979
IS LOOKING TO ADDRESS THE

08:19:36.046 --> 08:19:38.214
DECADES OLD CRISIS THAT IS

08:19:38.281 --> 08:19:39.716
HAPPENING IN L.A. COUNTY,

08:19:39.783 --> 08:19:40.950
SPECIFICALLY. AND I CAME AWARE

08:19:41.017 --> 08:19:42.952
OF THESE ISSUES WHEN I WAS THE

08:19:43.019 --> 08:19:44.454
CHAIR OF BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON

08:19:44.521 --> 08:19:45.055
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES THAT

08:19:45.121 --> 08:19:46.056
OVERSEES THE FUNDING TO OUR

08:19:46.122 --> 08:19:48.358
JUVENILE HALLS AFTER THE

08:19:48.425 --> 08:19:49.793
REALIGNMENT HAPPENED. SO IN MY

08:19:49.859 --> 08:19:51.094
BACKYARD, I HAVE ONE JUVENILE

08:19:51.161 --> 08:19:53.029
HALL. AND DURING MY THREE YEARS

08:19:53.096 --> 08:19:54.397
HERE, I STARTED HEARING ABOUT

08:19:54.464 --> 08:19:56.132
THE MISTREATMENT OF INDIVIDUALS

08:19:56.199 --> 08:19:58.735
IN THESE HALLS. IN FACT, ONE BOY

08:19:58.802 --> 08:20:02.005
DIED IN 2023 BECAUSE OF THE POOR

08:20:02.072 --> 08:20:03.506
STAFFING RATIOS THAT ARE

08:20:03.573 --> 08:20:05.342
OCCURRING IN OUR JUVENILE HALLS,

08:20:05.408 --> 08:20:07.110
PARTICULARLY IN THE ONE IN MY

08:20:07.177 --> 08:20:09.179
DISTRICT. AFTER CONDUCTING TWO

08:20:09.245 --> 08:20:10.714
INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS ON THIS

08:20:10.780 --> 08:20:13.016
VERY TOPIC, IT BECAME APPARENT

08:20:13.083 --> 08:20:15.819
THAT MORE NEEDED TO BE DONE. FOR

08:20:15.885 --> 08:20:17.253
DECADES. LA PROBATION AND

08:20:17.320 --> 08:20:17.821
SPECIFICALLY, AND I'M JUST

08:20:17.887 --> 08:20:19.656
POINTING OUT TO ABOUT LA

08:20:19.723 --> 08:20:23.159
PROBATION, HAS BEEN UNDER A

08:20:23.226 --> 08:20:25.428
VIOLATION BY OUR BSC, HAS BEEN

08:20:25.495 --> 08:20:27.230
TOLD BY SEVERAL JUDGES THAT THEY

08:20:27.297 --> 08:20:30.033
NEED TO CLOSE, HAVE HAD 30

08:20:30.100 --> 08:20:31.401
PROBATION OFFICERS INDICTED FOR

08:20:31.468 --> 08:20:33.370
RUNNING GLADIATOR GLADIATOR

08:20:33.436 --> 08:20:34.904
FIGHTS JUST TWO WEEKS OR THREE

08:20:34.971 --> 08:20:36.272
WEEKS AGO, HAS HAD ANOTHER

08:20:36.339 --> 08:20:38.041
PROBATION OFFICER ARRESTED FOR

08:20:38.108 --> 08:20:40.243
BRINGING IN DRUGS. JUVENILES

08:20:40.310 --> 08:20:42.479
HAVE ESCAPED FROM THESE HALLS,

08:20:42.545 --> 08:20:43.880
HAVE OVERDOSED FROM THESE HALLS

08:20:43.947 --> 08:20:46.549
AND FORTUNATELY HAVE NOT PASSED

08:20:46.616 --> 08:20:48.184
AWAY THIS YEAR. AND IT'S

08:20:48.251 --> 08:20:50.286
ONGOING, SO CLOSE THAT OUR

08:20:50.353 --> 08:20:52.055
ATTORNEY GENERAL WANTS TO PUT LA

08:20:52.122 --> 08:20:54.657
PROBATION UNDER RECEIVERSHIP AND

08:20:54.724 --> 08:20:57.060
HAS MENTIONED THAT PUBLICLY. SO

08:20:57.127 --> 08:20:59.028
WHILE LA COUNTY AND PROBATION

08:20:59.095 --> 08:21:00.997
AND THE CHIEF PROBATION HAS

08:21:01.064 --> 08:21:03.233
TRIED FOR YEARS TO FIND A

08:21:03.299 --> 08:21:04.667
SOLUTION, THERE HASN'T BEEN A

08:21:04.734 --> 08:21:05.468
SOLUTION AVAILABLE THAT HAS

08:21:05.535 --> 08:21:06.870
FIXED THE PROBLEMS. WHAT I'M

08:21:06.936 --> 08:21:08.338
BRINGING TO YOU COLLEAGUES ISN'T

08:21:08.405 --> 08:21:10.440
A MAGIC PILL IS I'M NOT CLAIMING

08:21:10.507 --> 08:21:11.808
THAT THIS IS GOING TO SOLVE

08:21:11.875 --> 08:21:12.809
EVERY SINGLE THING THAT'S

08:21:12.876 --> 08:21:14.344
HAPPENING IN LA PROBATION, BUT

08:21:14.411 --> 08:21:16.045
IT IS A STEP FORWARD. AND IN THE

08:21:16.112 --> 08:21:17.947
THREE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN HERE,

08:21:18.014 --> 08:21:19.115
NO OTHER COLLEAGUE HAS

08:21:19.182 --> 08:21:20.150
INTRODUCED A SOLUTION TO THIS

08:21:20.216 --> 08:21:21.951
PROBLEM. I'M THE FIRST MEMBER TO

08:21:22.018 --> 08:21:23.219
ATTEMPT TO TRY TO SOLVE WHAT'S

08:21:23.286 --> 08:21:24.687
HAPPENING IN LA COUNTY, BECAUSE

08:21:24.754 --> 08:21:26.189
WHAT IS HAPPENING IS SPECIFIC TO

08:21:26.256 --> 08:21:27.924
LA COUNTY, TO THE POINT THAT NO

08:21:27.991 --> 08:21:29.692
OTHER COUNTY IS LOOKING TO

08:21:29.759 --> 08:21:30.894
TRANSFER THEIR JUVENILES INTO LA

08:21:30.960 --> 08:21:33.363
COUNTY BECAUSE OF HOW BAD IT IS

08:21:33.430 --> 08:21:35.365
RIGHT NOW. THEY'RE UNDER ORDER

08:21:35.432 --> 08:21:37.700
TO MOVE JUVENILES OUT OF LOS

08:21:37.767 --> 08:21:38.735
PADRINOS BECAUSE IT'S IN

08:21:38.802 --> 08:21:40.403
VIOLATION, BECAUSE IT'S

08:21:40.470 --> 08:21:43.440
INHUMANE. TWO WEEKS AGO, WE HAD<u>%</u>

08:21:43.506 --> 08:21:45.942
JUVENILES WHO WERE ON LOCKDOWN

08:21:46.009 --> 08:21:47.477
FOR FIVE DAYS STRAIGHT, NOT

08:21:47.544 --> 08:21:48.845
BEING ABLE TO GO OUT, NOT BEING

08:21:48.912 --> 08:21:51.214
ABLE TO DO ANYTHING. THIS IS A

08:21:51.281 --> 08:21:53.116
CONSTANT HAPPENING IN OUR

08:21:53.183 --> 08:21:55.318
PROBATION OFFICE. YOU CAN LOOK

08:21:55.385 --> 08:21:57.187
UP LA TIMES AFTER LA TIMES

08:21:57.253 --> 08:21:59.222
ARTICLE THAT CALLS OUT A CALL

08:21:59.289 --> 08:22:00.523
OUT CULTURE, WHERE ON A DAY YOU

08:22:00.590 --> 08:22:03.126
CAN HAVE 60% OF OFFICERS NOT NOT

08:22:03.193 --> 08:22:05.395
SHOWING UP TO WORK. I RECOGNIZE

08:22:05.462 --> 08:22:06.896
THAT THERE MIGHT BE VACANCIES IN

08:22:06.963 --> 08:22:08.798
THESE POSITIONS, BUT LA COUNTY

08:22:08.865 --> 08:22:11.401
HAS EVEN INTRODUCED A $25,000

08:22:11.468 --> 08:22:14.070
SIGN ON BONUS AS OF DECEMBER OF

08:22:14.137 --> 08:22:15.805
LAST YEAR, TO BRING IN MORE

08:22:15.872 --> 08:22:17.574
OFFICERS TO FILL THOSE

08:22:17.640 --> 08:22:19.008
VACANCIES, I CAN GO THROUGH A

08:22:19.075 --> 08:22:20.109
LONG LIST OF WHAT'S HAPPENING.

08:22:20.176 --> 08:22:21.344
THE OPPOSITION WOULD TELL YOU

08:22:21.411 --> 08:22:23.079
THAT TRANSITIONING SOME OF THE

08:22:23.146 --> 08:22:24.514
DUTIES TO A DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT

08:22:24.581 --> 08:22:26.616
IS A PUBLIC HAZARD. IT'S GOING

08:22:26.683 --> 08:22:28.251
TO CREATE A PUBLIC SAFETY

08:22:28.318 --> 08:22:30.053
ISSUES. THIS IS A PUBLIC SAFETY

08:22:30.119 --> 08:22:31.721
ISSUE. KIDS ARE ESCAPING. KIDS

08:22:31.788 --> 08:22:34.123
ARE DYING. KIDS ARE BEING ARE

08:22:34.190 --> 08:22:35.091
OVERDOSING. KIDS ARE BEING

08:22:35.158 --> 08:22:36.593
FORCED TO FIGHT. CURRENTLY,

08:22:36.659 --> 08:22:39.162
RIGHT NOW, THE ADULT PROBATION

08:22:39.229 --> 08:22:40.363
OFFICERS WHO ARE IN THE FIELD,

08:22:40.430 --> 08:22:42.465
WHO OVERSEE ADULTS ARE ACTUALLY

08:22:42.532 --> 08:22:44.634
BEING PULLED OUT OF THE PUBLIC

08:22:44.701 --> 08:22:46.102
TO GO INTO JUVENILE HALLS.

08:22:46.169 --> 08:22:48.271
THAT'S A PUBLIC SAFETY HAZARD.

08:22:48.338 --> 08:22:49.205
THEY'RE SAYING THAT THE PEOPLE

08:22:49.272 --> 08:22:52.542
THAT WE WANT TO PROVIDE SOME OF

08:22:52.609 --> 08:22:53.142
THE FUNDING OR SOME OF THE

08:22:53.209 --> 08:22:55.645
SERVICES TO DO NOT HAVE THE

08:22:55.712 --> 08:22:56.246
TRAINING OR HAVE THE PROPER

08:22:56.312 --> 08:22:57.647
TRAINING TO TAKE CARE OF THESE

08:22:57.714 --> 08:22:59.749
KIDS. I WOULD SAY RIGHT NOW,

08:22:59.816 --> 08:23:00.850
UNFORTUNATELY, PROBATION IS NOT

08:23:00.917 --> 08:23:03.419
TAKING CARE OF OUR KIDS IN AN

08:23:03.486 --> 08:23:05.188
ADEQUATE MANNER. I SAY THIS IS A

08:23:05.255 --> 08:23:06.322
CRISIS THAT NEEDS A RESPONSE

08:23:06.389 --> 08:23:08.124
FROM THE STATE. AND IN DECEMBER

08:23:08.191 --> 08:23:10.226
OF LAST YEAR, I CALLED INTO AS A

08:23:10.293 --> 08:23:11.628
PUBLIC COMMENT INTO LA COUNTY

08:23:11.694 --> 08:23:13.062
AND SAID, I WILL HELP YOU,

08:23:13.129 --> 08:23:15.265
BECAUSE THEY ASKED SPECIFICALLY

08:23:15.331 --> 08:23:17.333
FOR STATE INTERVENTION. SO THIS

08:23:17.400 --> 08:23:20.436
IS WHAT SB 357 IS, STATE

08:23:20.503 --> 08:23:21.905
INTERVENTION THAT IS SPECIFIC TO

08:23:21.971 --> 08:23:23.006
LA COUNTY ONLY. THAT IS

08:23:23.072 --> 08:23:25.375
PERMISSIVE. THAT IS NOT GOING TO

08:23:25.441 --> 08:23:26.309
CHANGE IN ONE DAY. THAT IS GOING

08:23:26.376 --> 08:23:28.144
TO ALLOW THE COUNTY TO COME

08:23:28.211 --> 08:23:29.279
TOGETHER WITH DEPARTMENT OF

08:23:29.345 --> 08:23:31.147
YOUTH DEVELOPMENT, PROBATION AND

08:23:31.214 --> 08:23:32.949
SPELL OUT THE DUTIES AND

08:23:33.016 --> 08:23:33.983
DELEGATE THOSE DUTIES, WHICH IS

08:23:34.050 --> 08:23:36.152
WHY IT'S NOT PRESCRIPTIVE IN MY

08:23:36.219 --> 08:23:37.086
BILL, BECAUSE IT'S UP TO THE

08:23:37.153 --> 08:23:40.523
COUNTY TO DECIDE HOW THOSE JOBS

08:23:40.590 --> 08:23:42.125
AND DUTIES ARE GOING TO BE

08:23:42.191 --> 08:23:44.093
HANDLED IN THE COUNTY. I WILL

08:23:44.160 --> 08:23:45.828
LEAVE MOST OF EVERYTHING ELSE

08:23:45.895 --> 08:23:48.498
JUST TO RESPOND TO QUESTIONS,

08:23:48.565 --> 08:23:51.868
BUT MY COUNTY NEEDS HELP. KIDS

08:23:51.935 --> 08:23:54.837
ARE DYING. WE NEED TO STEP IN

08:23:54.904 --> 08:23:57.273
AND RESPOND TO THIS. JUDGES, OUR

08:23:57.340 --> 08:23:59.742
ATTORNEY GENERAL, OUR BSC, HAVE

08:23:59.809 --> 08:24:01.945
SAID LA PROBATION IS FAILING. IT

08:24:02.011 --> 08:24:03.346
IS OUR TURN NOW AS STATE, AS

08:24:03.413 --> 08:24:06.182
STATE LEGISLATORS TO INTERVENE

08:24:06.249 --> 08:24:07.750
AND DO SOMETHING BECAUSE NOTHING

08:24:07.817 --> 08:24:09.152
ELSE HAS BEEN DONE. THANK YOU.

08:24:09.218 --> 08:24:10.753
AND SENATOR, BEFORE I TURN IT

08:24:10.820 --> 08:24:12.789
OVER TO YOUR WITNESSES, I WANTED

08:24:12.855 --> 08:24:14.691
TO CLARIFY MY UNDERSTANDING AND

08:24:14.757 --> 08:24:16.025
I'LL ASK YOU TO CONFIRM ON THE

08:24:16.092 --> 08:24:17.460
RECORD OR CORRECT ME IF I'M

08:24:17.527 --> 08:24:18.628
MISTAKEN. MY UNDERSTANDING IS

08:24:18.695 --> 08:24:20.463
THAT SHOULD THE BILL PASS OUT OF

08:24:20.530 --> 08:24:21.497
COMMITTEE TODAY, YOU HAVE

08:24:21.564 --> 08:24:22.832
COMMITTED TO HOLDING THE BILL,

08:24:22.899 --> 08:24:24.701
NOT PRESENTING IT FOR A FLOOR

08:24:24.767 --> 08:24:25.868
VOTE IN THE ASSEMBLY BEFORE THE

08:24:25.935 --> 08:24:27.170
END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR. IS

08:24:27.236 --> 08:24:28.738
THAT CORRECT? CORRECT. OKAY.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WITH THAT,

08:24:29.839 --> 08:24:31.007
YOUR WITNESS MAY PROCEED. YOU

08:24:31.074 --> 08:24:32.675
WILL ALSO, MA'AM, HAVE UP TO

08:24:32.742 --> 08:24:34.043
FIVE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE

08:24:34.110 --> 08:24:34.744
COMMITTEE. THANK YOU, MISTER

MEMBERS DANIEL SANCHEZ, ON

08:28:59.842 --> 08:29:01.077
BEHALF OF THE CHIEF PROBATION

08:29:01.143 --> 08:29:02.278
OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA IN

08:29:02.345 --> 08:29:04.580
OPPOSITION TO SB 357 AS PROPOSED

08:29:04.647 --> 08:29:06.282
TO BE AMENDED. I DO WANT TO BE

08:29:06.349 --> 08:29:08.351
VERY CLEAR THAT CPAC IS A

08:29:08.417 --> 08:29:09.352
STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION MUST

08:29:09.418 --> 08:29:10.553
UNDERSCORE THAT THE CHANGES IN

08:29:10.620 --> 08:29:12.588
THIS BILL DO, IN FACT, HAVE

08:29:12.655 --> 08:29:13.456
IMPLICATIONS STATEWIDE TO

08:29:13.522 --> 08:29:14.523
PROBATION DEPARTMENTS, COURTS

08:29:14.590 --> 08:29:16.659
AND COUNTIES. THIS IS DUE TO THE

08:29:16.726 --> 08:29:17.693
INTEROPERABILITY OF COURT

08:29:17.760 --> 08:29:18.828
PROCESSES, TRANSFER OF

08:29:18.895 --> 08:29:20.696
RESIDENTS, TRANSFER OF COURT

08:29:20.763 --> 08:29:21.764
JURISDICTION AND SUPERVISION

08:29:21.831 --> 08:29:23.900
AMONG PROBATION. SO THIS DOES

08:29:23.966 --> 08:29:25.735
INDEED HAVE STATEWIDE PROBATION

08:29:25.801 --> 08:29:26.836
IMPACTS. PROBATION IS PART OF

08:29:26.903 --> 08:29:28.938
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PART OF THE

08:29:29.005 --> 08:29:29.872
COURTS. THAT IS CRITICAL BECAUSE

08:29:29.939 --> 08:29:31.741
THERE ARE REGULATIONS, STATUTES,

08:29:31.807 --> 08:29:33.142
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN PLACE

08:29:33.209 --> 08:29:34.977
THAT ARE NOT SIMPLE OR EASY IN

08:29:35.044 --> 08:29:36.379
NATURE. AND IT IS THAT PROBATION

08:29:36.445 --> 08:29:37.480
MISSION THAT IS NOT

08:29:37.546 --> 08:29:38.447
INTERCHANGEABLE WITH OTHER

08:29:38.514 --> 08:29:39.615
COUNTY ENTITIES OR

08:29:39.682 --> 08:29:41.784
NON-GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES. IT IS

08:29:41.851 --> 08:29:44.253
THOSE SPECIFIC FACTORS AND KIND

08:29:44.320 --> 08:29:45.955
OF MISSION OF PROBATION. THAT IS

08:29:46.022 --> 08:29:47.390
WHY PROBATION WORK IS CODIFIED

08:29:47.456 --> 08:29:49.392
IN THE GOVERNMENT CODE, WHICH IS

08:29:49.458 --> 08:29:51.260
IMPACTED BY THIS BILL. WHAT THE

08:29:51.327 --> 08:29:53.462
AUTHOR HAS SAID IS NEEDED TO BE

08:29:53.529 --> 08:29:54.530
DONE WITH CAN BE DONE WITHOUT

08:29:54.597 --> 08:29:56.966
THIS BILL. AND I THINK THAT IS A

08:29:57.033 --> 08:29:58.100
REALLY IMPORTANT THING TO

08:29:58.167 --> 08:29:59.502
HIGHLIGHT. BUT INSTEAD WHAT THIS

08:29:59.568 --> 08:30:01.037
BILL CHANGES IS THE GOVERNMENT

08:30:01.103 --> 08:30:02.672
CODE SECTION AND TRANSFERS

08:30:02.738 --> 08:30:04.240
PROBATION DUTIES TO ANOTHER

08:30:04.307 --> 08:30:06.242
ENTITY. THIS BILL REMOVES DUTIES

08:30:06.309 --> 08:30:07.743
FROM THE VERY ENTITY THAT HAS

08:30:07.810 --> 08:30:09.211
EXTENSIVE TRAINING AND

08:30:09.278 --> 08:30:10.613
EXPERIENCE IN BOTH THE YOUTH

08:30:10.680 --> 08:30:12.014
DEVELOPMENT AND REHABILITATION,

08:30:12.081 --> 08:30:13.649
AND THE SAFETY OF OUR

08:30:13.716 --> 08:30:15.318
COMMUNITIES. I ALSO WANT TO

08:30:15.384 --> 08:30:17.620
HIGHLIGHT THAT, AS NOTED IN THE

08:30:17.687 --> 08:30:18.888
ANALYSIS AROUND TRAINING AND

08:30:18.955 --> 08:30:20.022
QUALIFICATIONS, THIS BILL NOR

08:30:20.089 --> 08:30:22.525
THE AMENDMENTS ADDRESS THOSE

08:30:22.591 --> 08:30:23.926
FACTORS. AND WHEN WE ARE TALKING

08:30:23.993 --> 08:30:26.262
ABOUT OVERSEEING SECURE

08:30:26.329 --> 08:30:27.863
DETENTION FACILITIES AND ALSO

08:30:27.930 --> 08:30:29.765
ORDERS OF THE COURT FOR THE

08:30:29.832 --> 08:30:32.034
HIGHEST RISK, HIGHEST NEED, MOST

08:30:32.101 --> 08:30:34.437
SERIOUS YOUTH OFFENSES IN OUR

08:30:34.503 --> 08:30:36.172
STATE, THAT WE CANNOT TAKE THAT

08:30:36.238 --> 08:30:37.940
LIGHTLY. WHEN WE LOOK AT WHO IS

08:30:38.007 --> 08:30:40.209
HANDLING THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES.

08:30:40.276 --> 08:30:42.845
SO IN RECOGNIZING TIME, I WOULD

08:30:42.912 --> 08:30:44.447
JUST KIND OF CLOSE IN SAYING

08:30:44.513 --> 08:30:46.382
THIS BILL REPRESENTS A REMOVAL

08:30:46.449 --> 08:30:46.949
OF PROBATION FROM CRITICAL

08:30:47.016 --> 08:30:48.551
JUVENILE JUSTICE PROCESSES THAT

08:30:48.617 --> 08:30:50.319
DOES HAVE IMPLICATIONS TO PUBLIC

08:30:50.386 --> 08:30:52.121
SAFETY AND THE IMPORTANT

08:30:52.188 --> 08:30:52.989
INTERACTIONS THAT PROBATION HAS

08:30:53.055 --> 08:30:54.523
WITH OUR COURTS, WITH OUR COUNTY

08:30:54.590 --> 08:30:55.624
PARTNERS, AND WITH

08:30:55.691 --> 08:30:56.759
NON-GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES. SO

08:30:56.826 --> 08:30:58.627
FOR THOSE REASONS, WE ARE

08:30:58.694 --> 08:31:00.463

UNIQUE AND IMPORTANT ROLE IN OUR

FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE

08:31:28.991 --> 08:31:30.993
PETITION TO THE END OF THE CASE,

08:31:31.060 --> 08:31:33.095
WHEN HOPEFULLY THE RECORD IS

08:31:33.162 --> 08:31:33.763
SEALED AND THAT YOUNG PERSON CAN

08:31:33.829 --> 08:31:35.197
MOVE FORWARD. AND EVERY SINGLE

08:31:35.264 --> 08:31:36.132
STEP OF THAT WAY, THEY ARE

08:31:36.198 --> 08:31:37.033
WORKING WITH PROBATION TO

08:31:37.099 --> 08:31:38.434
ACCOMPLISH THE TASK THAT THEY

08:31:38.501 --> 08:31:40.002
NEED TO ACCOMPLISH. AND THE

08:31:40.069 --> 08:31:41.003
STATUTES AND THE WELFARE AND

08:31:41.070 --> 08:31:42.805
INSTITUTIONS CODE ARE CLEAR OF

08:31:42.872 --> 08:31:43.672
THE OBLIGATIONS OF PROBATION TO

08:31:43.739 --> 08:31:45.107
THE COURT AND THEIR ROLE WITH

08:31:45.174 --> 08:31:47.143
THE COURT. AS WE TYPICALLY SAY,

08:31:47.209 --> 08:31:48.477
PROBATION IS AN ARM OF THE

08:31:48.544 --> 08:31:51.814
COURT, AND SB 357 WOULD PROPOSE

08:31:51.881 --> 08:31:53.616
TO ALLOW UNILATERALLY A BOARD OF

08:31:53.682 --> 08:31:54.984
SUPERVISORS TO SEVER THAT ARM

08:31:55.051 --> 08:31:57.420
AND CRAFT A NEW ONE ON, WITHOUT

08:31:57.486 --> 08:31:59.455
ANY GUARANTEE THAT THERE WILL BE

08:31:59.522 --> 08:32:00.923
OBLIGATIONS TO DO THE DUTIES IN

08:32:00.990 --> 08:32:02.658
A TIMELY WAY WITH TRAINED

08:32:02.725 --> 08:32:03.726
PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE PREPARED

08:32:03.793 --> 08:32:05.961
TO DO THE WORK OF THE COURT. WE

08:32:06.028 --> 08:32:07.063
TAKE OUR STATUTORY MISSION IN

08:32:07.129 --> 08:32:07.963
THE JUVENILE COURT VERY

08:32:08.030 --> 08:32:09.465
SERIOUSLY AND WITHOUT MORE

08:32:09.532 --> 08:32:10.433
STRUCTURE AND STATUTORY CLARITY,

08:32:10.499 --> 08:32:12.068
WE DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE BEING

08:32:12.134 --> 08:32:14.603
ABLE TO ALLOW A BOARD OF

08:32:14.670 --> 08:32:15.704
SUPERVISORS TO DELEGATE THOSE

08:32:15.771 --> 08:32:16.272
RESPONSIBILITIES WITHOUT THE

08:32:16.338 --> 08:32:18.007
COURT BEING AT THE TABLE AND

08:32:18.074 --> 08:32:18.974
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE WORK WILL

08:32:19.041 --> 08:32:20.976
BE ABLE TO BE DONE, BECAUSE THE

08:32:21.043 --> 08:32:22.845
COURT WILL BE UNABLE TO THEN GO

08:32:22.912 --> 08:32:24.080
AND PROTECT THE BEST INTERESTS

08:32:24.146 --> 08:32:24.980
OF THOSE YOUTH. FOR THOSE

08:32:25.047 --> 08:32:27.316
REASONS, WE OPPOSE. THANK YOU A

08:32:27.383 --> 08:32:28.050
LITTLE BIT MORE THAN A MINUTE

08:32:28.117 --> 08:32:30.453
AND A HALF REMAINING. THANK YOU.

08:32:30.519 --> 08:32:31.353
THANK YOU, HONORABLE CHAIR AND

08:32:31.420 --> 08:32:33.122
HONORABLE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. MY

08:32:33.189 --> 08:32:34.757
NAME IS JONATHAN BIRD. THAT

08:32:34.824 --> 08:32:36.859
DOESN'T MEAN MUCH. NEXT MONTH

08:32:36.926 --> 08:32:38.594
WILL BE MY 50TH YEAR AS A

08:32:38.661 --> 08:32:40.496
RESIDENT OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY.

08:32:40.563 --> 08:32:41.931
I AM A JUVENILE PROBATION

08:32:41.997 --> 08:32:43.666
OFFICER IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY

08:32:43.732 --> 08:32:45.734
FOR 33 YEARS, AND I ALSO SERVE

08:32:45.801 --> 08:32:47.303
AS SECOND VICE PRESIDENT, CHAIR

08:32:47.369 --> 08:32:50.072
OF LOCAL 685. SO THAT GIVES ME

08:32:50.139 --> 08:32:52.007
ABILITY. IF I HAD TIME TO SPEAK

08:32:52.074 --> 08:32:53.242
ON SEVERAL THINGS THAT ARE

08:32:53.309 --> 08:32:55.211
CONTAINED IN THE BILL. BUT WHAT

08:32:55.277 --> 08:32:57.413
I'LL FIRST SAY ABOUT THE BILL IS

08:32:57.480 --> 08:32:58.848
ANYTIME A BILL IS PRESENTED, IT

08:32:58.914 --> 08:33:01.684
OUGHT TO GET TO THE ASSEMBLY

08:33:01.750 --> 08:33:03.786
MEMBERS AND BE CLEAR ON WHAT IT

08:33:03.853 --> 08:33:06.088
IS TRYING TO DO. AND THEN THERE

08:33:06.155 --> 08:33:07.756
SHOULD BE DUE DILIGENCE. THE

08:33:07.823 --> 08:33:11.060
BILL, AS THE AUTHOR HAS SAID, IS

08:33:11.127 --> 08:33:12.061
TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT ARE

08:33:12.128 --> 08:33:13.929
CAUSED BY PROBATION. EARLIER

08:33:13.996 --> 08:33:15.131
TODAY, I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE

08:33:15.197 --> 08:33:16.732
ALL DAY. EARLIER THE DAY, THE

08:33:16.799 --> 08:33:18.334
CHAIR MADE A STATEMENT, HE SAYS

08:33:18.400 --> 08:33:19.268
THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE

08:33:19.335 --> 08:33:21.070
CONCERNED ABOUT PROTECTING THE

08:33:21.137 --> 08:33:23.139
VALUES OF THE STATE. PROBATION

08:33:23.205 --> 08:33:25.074
HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE SINCE

08:33:25.141 --> 08:33:27.243
1903. IN THE YEAR OF 2000, THE

08:33:27.309 --> 08:33:29.078
STATE DECIDED THAT THEY NEEDED

08:33:29.145 --> 08:33:31.113
TO DO A PROBATION SERVICES TASK

08:33:31.180 --> 08:33:32.915
FORCE OUT OF THAT TASK FORCE

08:33:32.982 --> 08:33:34.583
THAT DID A REVIEW FOR THREE

08:33:34.650 --> 08:33:37.686
YEARS. IN JUNE OF 2003, IT

08:33:37.753 --> 08:33:39.889
PRESENTED A REPORT THAT MADE 17

08:33:39.955 --> 08:33:41.257
RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE STATE AND

08:33:41.323 --> 08:33:43.025
HOW TO HANDLE PROBATION

08:33:43.092 --> 08:33:43.959
DEPARTMENT, AND HOW TO GET ALL

08:33:44.026 --> 08:33:46.061
THE REFORMS THAT THEY NEED TO

08:33:46.128 --> 08:33:48.164
GET IN 30S. SO WHAT I WILL SAY

08:33:48.230 --> 08:33:50.666
ABOUT THE BILL, THE BILL IS AN

08:33:50.733 --> 08:33:52.034
ATTACK ON THE PROBATION

08:33:52.101 --> 08:33:54.370
DEPARTMENT. ANYONE THAT DOES NOT

08:33:54.436 --> 08:33:55.704
FEEL THE NEED TO VOTE IN

08:33:55.771 --> 08:33:57.139
OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL IS

08:33:57.206 --> 08:33:58.507
SAYING THAT PROBATION IS AN

08:33:58.574 --> 08:34:00.376
ENTITY THAT SHOULD NOT BE

08:34:00.442 --> 08:34:01.810
EXISTING IN THE STATE OF

08:34:01.877 --> 08:34:03.078
CALIFORNIA. AND IF THE AUTHOR

08:34:03.145 --> 08:34:04.446
WOULD LIKE TO HELP PROBATION,

08:34:04.513 --> 08:34:06.115
THEN MAYBE THE AUTHOR SHOULD

08:34:06.182 --> 08:34:08.250
CONCENTRATE ON HAVING ANOTHER

08:34:08.317 --> 08:34:10.085
PROBATION SERVICE TASK FORCE TO

08:34:10.152 --> 08:34:11.921
FIND THE REMEDIES SO THAT WE CAN

08:34:11.987 --> 08:34:13.122
PROTECT THE YOUTH OF THIS

08:34:13.189 --> 08:34:14.356

SUPERVISORS FOR WEIGHING IN AND

08:36:28.824 --> 08:36:30.059
WORKING ON THIS BILL. AND THE

08:36:30.125 --> 08:36:31.860
AUTHOR, AS WE KNOW, IS NOT

08:36:31.927 --> 08:36:34.930

08:36:34.997 --> 08:36:37.032

HERE AND EVERYTHING YOU GUYS

08:36:38.867 --> 08:36:40.569
SAID. I THINK THAT HAVING HAVING

08:36:40.636 --> 08:36:42.738
HEARD FROM BOTH SIDES AND LIVING

08:36:42.805 --> 08:36:44.473
IN LA COUNTY AND REPRESENTING LA

08:36:44.540 --> 08:36:46.241
COUNTY, WE ARE, I THINK, ALL ON

08:36:46.308 --> 08:36:48.243
THE SAME PAGE. WE WANT TO SEE

08:36:48.310 --> 08:36:49.144
BETTER OUTCOMES. I THINK

08:36:49.211 --> 08:36:50.212
EVERYONE WANTS TO SEE BETTER

08:36:50.279 --> 08:36:51.747
OUTCOMES. I THINK THE AUTHOR

08:36:51.814 --> 08:36:52.848
WANTS TO SEE BETTER OUTCOMES.

08:36:52.915 --> 08:36:54.016
ALL FIVE OF OUR COUNTY

08:36:54.083 --> 08:36:55.751
SUPERVISORS WANT TO SEE BETTER

08:36:55.818 --> 08:36:56.952
OUTCOMES. AND THE ISSUE THAT

08:36:57.019 --> 08:36:58.420
WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE IS

08:36:58.487 --> 08:36:59.555
INDISPUTABLE. WE NEED TO BE

08:36:59.621 --> 08:37:01.023
BETTER. WE NEED TO BE BETTER IN

08:37:01.090 --> 08:37:02.658
THESE INSTITUTIONS FOR OUR

08:37:02.725 --> 08:37:05.361
YOUTH, AND WE NEED TO HAVE

08:37:05.427 --> 08:37:07.896
BETTER TREATMENT WITHIN THESE

08:37:07.963 --> 08:37:09.064
FACILITIES. THE QUESTION IS, HOW

08:37:09.131 --> 08:37:10.766
DO WE GET THERE? AND I THINK

08:37:10.833 --> 08:37:12.334
THAT THE AUTHOR HAS DONE A GOOD

08:37:12.401 --> 08:37:14.503
JOB OF WORKING WITH OPPOSITION,

08:37:14.570 --> 08:37:15.437
AND I APPRECIATE JUST HOW HARD

08:37:15.504 --> 08:37:16.572
YOU'VE WORKED AND THE INORDINATE

08:37:16.638 --> 08:37:18.107
AMOUNT OF TIME THAT HAS GONE

08:37:18.173 --> 08:37:19.808
INTO THIS BILL. I DO THINK THESE

08:37:19.875 --> 08:37:21.009
AMENDMENTS GIVE US MORE TIME,

08:37:21.076 --> 08:37:23.712
AND I DO THINK THAT THERE'S A

08:37:23.779 --> 08:37:25.914
PROCESS THAT THAT CAN WORK OUT

08:37:25.981 --> 08:37:27.716
WHERE CONVERSATIONS AND

08:37:27.783 --> 08:37:29.852
HOPEFULLY SOLUTIONS CAN BE HAD,

08:37:29.918 --> 08:37:31.053
BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

08:37:31.120 --> 08:37:33.822
TIME AND FOR BOTH SIDES. THERE'S

08:37:33.889 --> 08:37:35.624
BEEN A LOT OF TIME PUT INTO

08:37:35.691 --> 08:37:37.226
THIS, AND WE'RE STILL AT A PLACE

08:37:37.292 --> 08:37:38.861
THAT ISN'T IDEAL. AND I DON'T

08:37:38.927 --> 08:37:41.029
THINK THIS IS AN ATTACK. AND I

08:37:41.096 --> 08:37:43.165
DO THINK THAT NO ONE UP HERE

08:37:43.232 --> 08:37:43.699
WANTS TO ATTACK PROBATION

08:37:43.766 --> 08:37:45.100
OFFICERS. CERTAINLY NOT. I COULD

08:37:45.167 --> 08:37:46.869
LOOK AROUND THIS DAIS. NOT A

08:37:46.935 --> 08:37:48.404
SINGLE PERSON UP HERE WOULD WANT

08:37:48.470 --> 08:37:49.738
TO ATTACK ANYTHING THAT

08:37:49.805 --> 08:37:51.240
PROBATION OFFICERS OR ANYONE IN

08:37:51.306 --> 08:37:53.642
LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES. BUT I DO

08:37:53.709 --> 08:37:56.345
THINK THAT WE OWE IT TO THOSE

08:37:56.412 --> 08:37:58.280
GOING THROUGH THIS SYSTEM TO

08:37:58.347 --> 08:38:00.883
ENSURE THAT THERE IS A JUST,

08:38:00.949 --> 08:38:04.486
EQUITABLE PROCESS FOR THEM. AND

08:38:04.553 --> 08:38:06.355
WE ARE WE ARE FALLING SHORT. AND

08:38:06.422 --> 08:38:08.257
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THIS

08:38:08.323 --> 08:38:10.259
WILL LEAD, BUT I DO THINK THAT,

08:38:10.325 --> 08:38:12.060
AS THE SENATOR SAID, NO ONE HAS

08:38:12.127 --> 08:38:13.328
BEEN WILLING TO TAKE THIS ON,

08:38:13.395 --> 08:38:16.031
AND I DO APPRECIATE THAT SHE HAS

08:38:16.098 --> 08:38:17.833
TAKEN IT ON. AND WITH THESE

08:38:17.900 --> 08:38:18.867
AMENDMENTS, I WILL MOVE THE

08:38:18.934 --> 08:38:21.003
BILL. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, MR.

08:38:21.069 --> 08:38:22.070
GARABEDIAN. I'LL COME BACK AND

08:38:22.137 --> 08:38:23.872
ASK FOR A SECOND. BUT WE DO HAVE

08:38:23.939 --> 08:38:25.174
A MOTION. WITH THAT SAID, WOULD

08:38:25.240 --> 08:38:27.309
ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO JUMP IN? MR.

08:38:27.376 --> 08:38:30.312
HANEY, PLEASE? WELL, THANK YOU

08:38:30.379 --> 08:38:31.814
TO THE AUTHOR. AND THANK YOU FOR

08:38:31.880 --> 08:38:33.015
YOUR LEADERSHIP. AND I KNOW THE

08:38:33.081 --> 08:38:35.083
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AS WELL,

08:38:35.150 --> 08:38:36.852
WHO ARE REALLY TRYING TO LOOK AT

08:38:36.919 --> 08:38:40.122
HOW BEST TO SERVE THE YOUNG

08:38:40.189 --> 08:38:42.257
PEOPLE OF YOUR COUNTY, HOW TO

08:38:42.324 --> 08:38:44.760
ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE BEST

08:38:44.827 --> 08:38:46.862
SUPPORTS, PLACEMENTS,

08:38:46.929 --> 08:38:48.764
OPPORTUNITIES FOR SERVICES, FOR

08:38:48.831 --> 08:38:51.667
SAFETY, FOR REENTRY, AND HAVE

08:38:51.733 --> 08:38:53.435
COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THIS

08:38:53.502 --> 08:38:55.370
IS THE WAY TO GO ABOUT IT. AND

08:38:55.437 --> 08:38:58.006
SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I

08:38:58.073 --> 08:38:59.908
RESPECT AND SOMETHING I THINK

08:38:59.975 --> 08:39:03.145
SHOULD BE A RESPONSIBILITY THAT

08:39:03.212 --> 08:39:05.747
ALL OF US HAVE. I SERVED ON THE

08:39:05.814 --> 08:39:07.082
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN SAN

08:39:07.149 --> 08:39:09.551
FRANCISCO. THIS WAS ALSO A HUGE

08:39:09.618 --> 08:39:11.286
CONCERN FOR US. WHEN I WAS ON

08:39:11.353 --> 08:39:13.355
THAT BOARD. WE ACTUALLY TOOK THE

08:39:13.422 --> 08:39:15.591
STEPS IN MY FIRST YEAR ON THE

08:39:15.657 --> 08:39:16.825
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO PASS A

08:39:16.892 --> 08:39:19.394
LAW TO, TO CLOSE OR ATTEMPT TO

08:39:19.461 --> 08:39:21.430
CLOSE OUR JUVENILE FACILITY,

08:39:21.497 --> 08:39:23.932
BECAUSE THERE WAS A SENSE THAT

08:39:23.999 --> 08:39:25.901
AND I THINK IT'S A REAL ONE,

08:39:25.968 --> 08:39:28.303
THAT FOR MOST YOUNG PEOPLE, THEY

08:39:28.370 --> 08:39:31.206
SHOULD NOT BE LOCKED UP IN

08:39:31.273 --> 08:39:33.041
CAGES. THEY SHOULD NOT BE

08:39:33.108 --> 08:39:34.643
INCARCERATED IN IN SITUATIONS

08:39:34.710 --> 08:39:36.945
LIKE WHERE WE PLACE ADULTS, AND

08:39:37.012 --> 08:39:38.847
THAT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, THAT

08:39:38.914 --> 08:39:40.849
WILL LEAD TO THE TYPE OF

08:39:40.916 --> 08:39:42.351
OUTCOMES THAT ARE ACTUALLY MUCH

08:39:42.417 --> 08:39:45.053
WORSE FOR THEM. AND WE HAD, YOU

08:39:45.120 --> 08:39:47.122
KNOW, LIKE YOU, YOU ALL HAVE

08:39:47.189 --> 08:39:48.857
MANY, MANY GENERATIONS,

08:39:48.924 --> 08:39:50.659
TRAGICALLY, OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO

08:39:50.726 --> 08:39:52.361
HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS, THESE

08:39:52.427 --> 08:39:54.196
SYSTEMS. AND WE'VE NOT ONLY

08:39:54.263 --> 08:39:57.065
FAILED THEM, WE'VE HARMED THEM.

08:39:57.132 --> 08:39:59.234
AND THAT SHOULD LEAD US TO THINK

08:39:59.301 --> 08:40:01.537
ABOUT FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES.

08:40:01.603 --> 08:40:05.040
ABSOLUTELY. AND SO I, I RESPECT

08:40:05.107 --> 08:40:07.376
AND APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS THAT

08:40:07.442 --> 08:40:09.978
ARE BEING TAKEN TO DO THAT. I

08:40:10.045 --> 08:40:12.548
WILL SAY THAT DURING THE TIME

08:40:12.614 --> 08:40:14.049
WHEN WE WERE CONSIDERING EVEN

08:40:14.116 --> 08:40:17.486
CLOSING OUR FACILITY, THERE WAS

08:40:17.553 --> 08:40:20.088
NOT AN EFFORT UNDER

08:40:20.155 --> 08:40:21.990
CONSIDERATION TO ACTUALLY MOVE

08:40:22.057 --> 08:40:27.262
THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF. CUSTODY

08:40:27.329 --> 08:40:29.398
AND SERVICES THAT WE WERE

08:40:29.464 --> 08:40:31.934
LEGALLY MANDATED TO, TO BE

08:40:32.000 --> 08:40:33.902
RESPONSIBLE FOR OUT OF OUR

08:40:33.969 --> 08:40:35.704
JUVENILE PROBATION, THAT IT WAS

08:40:35.771 --> 08:40:37.239
THAT IT WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING

08:40:37.306 --> 08:40:39.041
THAT WE KNEW THAT WE HAD TO DO

08:40:39.107 --> 08:40:41.410
WITH THESE OFFICERS, WITH THE

08:40:41.476 --> 08:40:43.211
STAFF, WITH THE FOLKS WHO ARE

08:40:43.278 --> 08:40:44.246
PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES NOW.

08:40:44.313 --> 08:40:46.448
AND IT HAD TO BE DONE IN

08:40:46.515 --> 08:40:47.883
COLLABORATION WITHIN THE SYSTEM

08:40:47.950 --> 08:40:50.085
THAT WE HAD, WHICH IS ONE THAT

08:40:50.152 --> 08:40:53.388
NOT ONLY IS SOMETHING THAT WE

08:40:53.455 --> 08:40:55.223
SET AS, AS, AS THE BOARD, BUT

08:40:55.290 --> 08:40:57.192
THAT IS SET BY THE STATE. THERE

08:40:57.259 --> 08:40:59.394
ARE CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITIES

08:40:59.461 --> 08:41:02.030
AROUND CUSTODY OF WHO HAS TO

08:41:02.097 --> 08:41:03.765
CARE FOR SOMEBODY. ONCE A COURT

08:41:03.832 --> 08:41:05.901
MAKES A DECISION, WHO TAKES ON

08:41:05.968 --> 08:41:07.703
THAT RESPONSIBILITY AND WHAT

08:41:07.769 --> 08:41:09.638
THEIR TRAINING IS, WHAT SERVICES

08:41:09.705 --> 08:41:10.939
THEY HAVE TO PROVIDE. ALL OF

08:41:11.006 --> 08:41:13.308
THAT IS IN MANY CASES SET BY THE

08:41:13.375 --> 08:41:16.345
STATE. AND SO WHETHER WHETHER OR

08:41:16.411 --> 08:41:19.014
NOT THE RIGHT SOLUTION TO A VERY

08:41:19.081 --> 08:41:21.483
REAL PROBLEM IS TO MOVE FOLKS TO

08:41:21.550 --> 08:41:23.919
A DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT, I THINK

08:41:23.986 --> 08:41:27.322
IS ONE THAT IT SEEMS DESERVES

08:41:27.389 --> 08:41:29.625
SOME MORE CONVERSATION. AND SO I

08:41:29.691 --> 08:41:31.059
APPRECIATE THE STEPS THAT YOU'VE

08:41:31.126 --> 08:41:32.494
TAKEN NOT ONLY TO, TO, TO HAVE

08:41:32.561 --> 08:41:34.830
THESE AMENDMENTS, BUT ALSO TO

08:41:34.896 --> 08:41:37.299
COMMIT TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON

08:41:37.366 --> 08:41:39.334
THIS, THIS QUESTION AND TO DO

08:41:39.401 --> 08:41:41.169
SO, I HOPE, IN CLOSE

08:41:41.236 --> 08:41:42.904
COLLABORATION WITH THE FOLKS WHO

08:41:42.971 --> 08:41:44.439
ARE STAKEHOLDERS, WHO PROVIDE

08:41:44.506 --> 08:41:45.874
THOSE SERVICES CURRENTLY, WHO

08:41:45.941 --> 08:41:47.309
ARE STAFF AND THEIR

08:41:47.376 --> 08:41:49.111
REPRESENTATIVES, THE, THE, THE,

08:41:49.177 --> 08:41:50.846
THE, THE UNIONS, WHO REPRESENT

08:41:50.912 --> 08:41:52.681
THE FOLKS WHO, WHO DO THOSE

08:41:52.748 --> 08:41:54.282
SERVICES AND HAVE THOSE

08:41:54.349 --> 08:41:55.550
RESPONSIBILITIES NOW. AND SO I

08:41:55.617 --> 08:41:57.386
THINK, YOU KNOW, TAKING THAT

08:41:57.452 --> 08:41:58.854
TIME AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE

08:41:58.920 --> 08:42:00.922
CONSEQUENCES OF THIS WILL BE AND

08:42:00.989 --> 08:42:02.457
HOW TO DO IT RIGHT, IS CRUCIAL.

08:42:02.524 --> 08:42:05.861
I WANT TO ASK A QUESTION WHICH

08:42:05.927 --> 08:42:08.130
THIS THIS MAY BE IN PART FOR THE

08:42:08.196 --> 08:42:09.965
AUTHOR AND MAY BE IN PART FOR

08:42:10.032 --> 08:42:11.566
THE OPPOSITION, BECAUSE ONE OF

08:42:11.633 --> 08:42:12.801
THE THINGS THAT WAS CONCERNING

08:42:12.868 --> 08:42:15.070
TO ME IS THIS SENSE THAT, AS I

08:42:15.137 --> 08:42:17.873
SAID, THAT WE'VE SET CERTAIN

08:42:17.939 --> 08:42:22.177
STATE LAWS OF HOW JUVENILES IN

08:42:22.244 --> 08:42:25.847
CUSTODY ARE REQUIRED TO BE HELD,

08:42:25.914 --> 08:42:27.849
TRANSFERRED. THE TRAINING

08:42:27.916 --> 08:42:29.484
INVOLVED THE THAT THAT THERE ARE

08:42:29.551 --> 08:42:32.020
CERTAIN STATE MANDATES HERE FOR

08:42:32.087 --> 08:42:35.257
GOOD REASON AND SOME OF ALSO LED

08:42:35.323 --> 08:42:37.426
BY THE COURTS THAT IF WE HAD ONE

08:42:37.492 --> 08:42:39.528
COUNTY WHICH WOULD HAPPEN TO BE

08:42:39.594 --> 08:42:42.364
OUR BIGGEST COUNTY THAT HAD A

08:42:42.431 --> 08:42:44.900
DIFFERENT SET OF FOLKS

08:42:44.966 --> 08:42:46.001
RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT, A

08:42:46.068 --> 08:42:47.402
DIFFERENT SET OF TRAINING AND

08:42:47.469 --> 08:42:49.204
SERVICES, MAYBE NOT OFFICERS, IN

08:42:49.271 --> 08:42:51.440
THE SAME WAY THAT THIS WOULD

08:42:51.506 --> 08:42:53.909
CREATE CHALLENGES FOR THE COURTS

08:42:53.975 --> 08:42:55.577
AND IT COULD CREATE CHALLENGES

08:42:55.644 --> 08:42:56.378
FOR OTHER COUNTIES. IT WAS

08:42:56.445 --> 08:42:57.879
INTERESTING TO ME TO SEE THAT

08:42:57.946 --> 08:42:59.014
THERE WERE MULTIPLE OTHER

08:42:59.081 --> 08:43:01.383
COUNTIES THAT WERE HERE IN

08:43:01.450 --> 08:43:02.818
OPPOSITION SANTA CRUZ, CONTRA

08:43:02.884 --> 08:43:07.189
COSTA COUNTY. AND SO HOW THIS IS

08:43:07.255 --> 08:43:07.989
FOR THE AUTHOR AND SPONSOR.

08:43:08.056 --> 08:43:10.625
MAYBE FIRST, HOW DO YOU THINK

08:43:10.692 --> 08:43:13.962
THAT THIS EFFORT WOULD BE ABLE

08:43:14.029 --> 08:43:15.363
TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS SO

08:43:15.430 --> 08:43:16.865
THAT WE STILL WERE ABLE YOU ALL

08:43:16.932 --> 08:43:19.034
WERE STILL ABLE TO ABIDE BY THE

08:43:19.101 --> 08:43:19.968
RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER STATE LAW

08:43:20.035 --> 08:43:22.971
AND INTERACT EFFECTIVELY AND

08:43:23.038 --> 08:43:24.806
APPROPRIATELY WITH THE OTHER

08:43:24.873 --> 08:43:26.208
COUNTIES AS AS MANDATED BY THE

08:43:26.274 --> 08:43:28.677
LAW, AS MANDATED BY THE STATE

08:43:28.744 --> 08:43:29.544
AND THE COURTS. THANK YOU FOR

08:43:29.611 --> 08:43:30.779
THE OPPORTUNITY TO FOR ME TO

08:43:30.846 --> 08:43:32.514
ANSWER THIS, I FORGOT TO MENTION

08:43:32.581 --> 08:43:35.150
THIS IN MY OPENING REMARKS. SO I

08:43:35.217 --> 08:43:36.551
KNOW THE OPPOSITION MENTIONED ON

08:43:36.618 --> 08:43:38.153
THE TRANSFER BETWEEN COUNTY AND

08:43:38.220 --> 08:43:40.188
SO FORTH. THE MOU S ARE BETWEEN

08:43:40.255 --> 08:43:42.357
COUNTIES ONLY, NOT BETWEEN

08:43:42.424 --> 08:43:44.426
PROBATION, SO IT WON'T IMPACT

08:43:44.493 --> 08:43:47.696
ANY TRANSFERS FROM COUNTY OF

08:43:47.763 --> 08:43:49.030
SANTA CRUZ TO LA COUNTY BECAUSE

08:43:49.097 --> 08:43:52.167
AS THOSE MOUS ARE WITH LA COUNTY

08:43:52.234 --> 08:43:54.236
SPECIFICALLY ONLY. SO YOU CAN

08:43:54.302 --> 08:43:55.937
STILL TRANSFER IF YOU WISH. BUT

08:43:56.004 --> 08:43:58.373
RESPECTFULLY, I DON'T. I DON'T

08:43:58.440 --> 08:44:00.242
KNOW IF YOUR COUNTY'S ASSEMBLY

08:44:00.308 --> 08:44:02.043
MEMBER IS GOING TO WANT TO SEND

08:44:02.110 --> 08:44:03.278
JUVENILES TO MY COUNTY RIGHT

08:44:03.345 --> 08:44:04.346
NOW, BUT THE CONTRACTS ARE

08:44:04.412 --> 08:44:05.814
BETWEEN THE COUNTIES. THE SECOND

08:44:05.881 --> 08:44:08.383
POINT, YOU'RE 100% RIGHT, AND I

08:44:08.450 --> 08:44:10.085
HAVEN'T RECEIVED A SINGLE

08:44:10.152 --> 08:44:11.686
AMENDMENT FROM OPPOSITION EXCEPT

08:44:11.753 --> 08:44:14.156
THE COURTS. THAT'S THE ONLY

08:44:14.222 --> 08:44:15.390
AMENDMENT I'VE BEEN I'VE

08:44:15.457 --> 08:44:17.926
RECEIVED. AND IN FACT, I DID WAS

08:44:17.993 --> 08:44:20.562
WE SENT IT UP TO OUR ALLEGED

08:44:20.629 --> 08:44:22.297
COUNSEL ON ENSURING WHAT THEY

08:44:22.364 --> 08:44:24.132
REQUESTED OF ME, OF THE COURTS I

08:44:24.199 --> 08:44:26.268
WAS GOING TO DO AS AN AUTHOR

08:44:26.334 --> 08:44:26.902
AMENDMENT GOT DISTRACTED WITH

08:44:26.968 --> 08:44:27.969
ALL THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS

08:44:28.036 --> 08:44:29.237
THAT WE WERE GOING BACK AND

08:44:29.304 --> 08:44:31.640
FORTH, THAT I DID NOT SUBMIT

08:44:31.706 --> 08:44:32.507
AMENDMENTS TO THE COMMITTEE.

08:44:32.574 --> 08:44:34.876
THAT IS MY FAULT. SO WE ARE

08:44:34.943 --> 08:44:36.511
PREPARED TO DO OTHER AMENDMENTS

08:44:36.578 --> 08:44:38.580
ON THE FLOOR TO ADDRESS THE

08:44:38.647 --> 08:44:40.682
COURT'S, TO ADDRESS THEIR

08:44:40.749 --> 08:44:42.284
CONCERN OF REMAINING OF KEEPING

08:44:42.350 --> 08:44:44.686
THAT RELATIONSHIP. ADDITIONALLY,

08:44:44.753 --> 08:44:47.355
IN THE L.A. COUNTY'S MOTION TO

08:44:47.422 --> 08:44:49.057
SUPPORT THIS BILL, THEY DICTATED

08:44:49.124 --> 08:44:50.725
AND PUT THAT THE RELATIONSHIP

08:44:50.792 --> 08:44:53.028
BETWEEN LA PROBATION AND COURTS

08:44:53.094 --> 08:44:54.863
WERE NOT GOING TO CHANGE

08:44:54.930 --> 08:44:56.131
WHATSOEVER. AND THE COURTS ARE

08:44:56.198 --> 08:44:57.599
ASKING ME TO MATCH THAT

08:44:57.666 --> 08:44:58.834
RELATIONSHIP TO ENSURE

08:44:58.900 --> 08:45:00.669
CONTINUITY OF CARE REMAINS. AND

08:45:00.735 --> 08:45:02.637
THE WHOLE ROLE IS TO ENSURE THAT

08:45:02.704 --> 08:45:04.072
PROBATION CAN STILL PROVIDE

08:45:04.139 --> 08:45:05.307
RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE COURT,

08:45:05.373 --> 08:45:07.475
BUT ALSO ALLOW THE OPPORTUNITY

08:45:07.542 --> 08:45:09.010
FOR, IN THIS CASE, D D

08:45:09.077 --> 08:45:10.879
DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH DEVELOPMENT

08:45:10.946 --> 08:45:12.814
TO ALSO PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS

08:45:12.881 --> 08:45:13.882
AS WELL. AND THE AMENDMENT I

08:45:13.949 --> 08:45:15.917
WANT TO REMIND THAT WE TOOK FROM

08:45:15.984 --> 08:45:18.320
THIS COMMITTEE STATES THAT THIS

08:45:18.386 --> 08:45:22.090
WILL RESULT IN NO LOSS OF

08:45:22.157 --> 08:45:23.225
REPRESENTATIVE STAFF CURRENTLY

08:45:23.291 --> 08:45:24.893
EMPLOYED BY COUNTY PROBATION.

08:45:24.960 --> 08:45:26.761
NOT A SINGLE LOSS FROM COUNTY

08:45:26.828 --> 08:45:28.330
PROBATION WILL HAPPEN. SO

08:45:28.396 --> 08:45:30.532
THEY'RE STILL GOING TO BE IN

08:45:30.599 --> 08:45:31.433
THESE JUVENILE HALLS. IT'S JUST

08:45:31.499 --> 08:45:32.934
THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN CHARGE OF

08:45:33.001 --> 08:45:36.137
THE SECURITY OF IT. LET OTHER

08:45:36.204 --> 08:45:37.606
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE MORE, WHO

08:45:37.672 --> 08:45:39.074
ARE TRAINED ON THE SOCIAL

08:45:39.140 --> 08:45:40.375
SERVICES OF THINGS TO PROVIDE

08:45:40.442 --> 08:45:43.378
THE REHABILITATIVE,

08:45:43.445 --> 08:45:44.846
REHABILITATIVE PORTION OF THE

08:45:44.913 --> 08:45:47.816
SERVICES IN THEIR HOUSE. THANK

08:45:47.883 --> 08:45:49.851
YOU, MR. HANEY. ANYTHING ELSE?

08:45:49.918 --> 08:45:51.319
THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND THAT

08:45:51.386 --> 08:45:53.455
THAT IS AND I KNOW THAT. AND I

08:45:53.521 --> 08:45:54.890
APPRECIATE THE CONTINUED WORK ON

08:45:54.956 --> 08:45:56.291
THIS AND ALL OF THE WORK THAT

08:45:56.358 --> 08:45:57.893
HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE. AND IT

08:45:57.959 --> 08:45:59.027
SOUNDS LIKE THERE IS A

08:45:59.094 --> 08:46:01.096
COMMITMENT THERE, BOTH TO WORK

08:46:01.162 --> 08:46:04.199
WITH THE COURTS AND AS WELL AS,

08:46:04.266 --> 08:46:07.135
I WOULD HOPE, THE PROBATION

08:46:07.202 --> 08:46:08.703
OFFICERS AND THE STAFF IN TERMS

08:46:08.770 --> 08:46:10.005
OF HOW THIS WOULD OPERATE. SOME

08:46:10.071 --> 08:46:11.973
OF THESE AMENDMENTS, I WAS

08:46:12.040 --> 08:46:13.441
GETTING TEXTS AND CALLS THAT

08:46:13.508 --> 08:46:14.809
THAT FOLKS WHO SHOULD DEFINITELY

08:46:14.876 --> 08:46:16.611
BE INVOLVED IN IN THIS PROCESS,

08:46:16.678 --> 08:46:18.179
YOU KNOW, MOVING FORWARD, HADN'T

08:46:18.246 --> 08:46:20.682
SEEN THE AMENDMENTS AND SOME OF

08:46:20.749 --> 08:46:22.183
THEM WERE INTENDED TO SUPPORT

08:46:22.250 --> 08:46:23.785
THEIR INVOLVEMENT AND ADDRESS

08:46:23.852 --> 08:46:25.120
SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS. AND I

08:46:25.186 --> 08:46:27.055
KNOW THAT HAPPENS. I'M NOT

08:46:27.122 --> 08:46:28.089
BLAMING ANYONE FOR THAT. THAT

08:46:28.156 --> 08:46:29.024
HAPPENS IN MY COMMITTEE TOO.

08:46:29.090 --> 08:46:30.892
THAT'S NOT ANYBODY'S FAULT IN

08:46:30.959 --> 08:46:32.794
PARTICULAR, BUT IT DOES SPEAK TO

08:46:32.861 --> 08:46:34.496
THE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS THAT

08:46:34.562 --> 08:46:35.864
THAT THAT NEED TO HAPPEN WITH

08:46:35.931 --> 08:46:37.799
THE FOLKS WHO WILL BE IMPACTED,

08:46:37.866 --> 08:46:40.568
I WONDER JUST IF, IF, IF, IF

08:46:40.635 --> 08:46:42.637
THROUGH THE CHAIR, THAT IF THE

08:46:42.704 --> 08:46:44.072
OPPOSITION COULD ALSO ADDRESS

08:46:44.139 --> 08:46:46.675
THIS QUESTION OF, YOU KNOW,

08:46:46.741 --> 08:46:49.644
WHETHER HAVING ONE COUNTY, YOU

08:46:49.711 --> 08:46:51.613
KNOW, LARGEST COUNTY WHO DOESN'T

08:46:51.680 --> 08:46:53.214
HAVE THESE RESPONSIBILITIES

08:46:53.281 --> 08:46:54.382
WITHIN A DEPARTMENT THAT EVERY

08:46:54.449 --> 08:46:56.885
OTHER COUNTY HAS, WHAT WE WOULD

08:46:56.952 --> 08:46:58.987
NEED TO BE CHANGE, WHAT WOULD

08:46:59.054 --> 08:47:01.056
WHAT SORT OF IMPACTS THAT THAT

08:47:01.122 --> 08:47:03.258
WILL HAVE. AND MAYBE RESPONDING

08:47:03.325 --> 08:47:04.893
TO THE TO THE AUTHOR'S POINTS

08:47:04.960 --> 08:47:07.495
THERE, IF I MAY, THROUGH THE

08:47:07.562 --> 08:47:09.030
CHAIR. IT'S A REALLY, I THINK,

08:47:09.097 --> 08:47:09.898
IMPORTANT QUESTION WHEN YOU TALK

08:47:09.965 --> 08:47:11.599
ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THERE ARE

08:47:11.666 --> 08:47:12.534
STANDARDS AND QUALIFICATIONS

08:47:12.600 --> 08:47:13.501
THAT APPLY STATEWIDE, BECAUSE

08:47:13.568 --> 08:47:15.470
PART OF WHAT WE HAVE SEEN WITH

08:47:15.537 --> 08:47:16.271
THE LEGISLATURE OVER THE MANY

08:47:16.338 --> 08:47:18.340
YEARS THAT PROBATION HAS BEEN IN

08:47:18.406 --> 08:47:19.541
EXISTENCE IS THE ABILITY TO KIND

08:47:19.607 --> 08:47:20.909
OF SET FORTH SOME POLICY

08:47:20.976 --> 08:47:22.043
DIRECTIONS THAT THEY WANT TO SEE

08:47:22.110 --> 08:47:23.611
CARRIED OUT STATEWIDE. AND SOME

08:47:23.678 --> 08:47:25.080
OF THOSE THINGS ARE AROUND

08:47:25.146 --> 08:47:26.281
REGULATIONS OF FACILITIES,

08:47:26.348 --> 08:47:27.649
MINIMUM TRAINING OF OUR

08:47:27.716 --> 08:47:28.817
OFFICERS, BOTH FROM A PEACE

08:47:28.883 --> 08:47:30.352
OFFICER PERSPECTIVE, BUT ALSO

08:47:30.418 --> 08:47:32.587
THE DUTIES WE HAVE WITH THE

08:47:32.654 --> 08:47:33.688
COURT AROUND JUVENILE

08:47:33.755 --> 08:47:35.156
CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND

08:47:35.223 --> 08:47:36.725
HOW TO MANAGE DE-ESCALATION AND

08:47:36.791 --> 08:47:38.760
ALL OF ALL OF THE REALLY

08:47:38.827 --> 08:47:40.195
IMPORTANT ASPECTS TO THAT KIND

08:47:40.261 --> 08:47:41.196
OF YOUTH DEVELOPMENT WORK. THERE

08:47:41.262 --> 08:47:42.731
ARE ALSO EXTENSIVE RULES OF

08:47:42.797 --> 08:47:45.066
COURT. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU LOOK

08:47:45.133 --> 08:47:46.368
THROUGHOUT THE WELFARE AND

08:47:46.434 --> 08:47:47.068
INSTITUTIONS CODE SECTION,

08:47:47.135 --> 08:47:49.537
AGAIN, STATE POLICIES THAT SET

08:47:49.604 --> 08:47:51.206
FORTH WHAT IS TO BE CARRIED OUT

08:47:51.272 --> 08:47:53.241
AS IT RELATES TO OUR JUVENILE

08:47:53.308 --> 08:47:54.342
JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND SO IF YOU

08:47:54.409 --> 08:47:56.177
HAVE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS IN

08:47:56.244 --> 08:47:57.779
DIFFERENT PLACES, THAT IS GOING

08:47:57.846 --> 08:48:00.115
TO HAVE IMPACTS TO BOTH PUBLIC

08:48:00.181 --> 08:48:01.249
SAFETY AND HOW THE COURTS CARRY

08:48:01.316 --> 08:48:03.451
OUT THEIR ORDERS AND HOW THOSE

08:48:03.518 --> 08:48:04.219
THINGS ARE DONE, I DO WANT TO

08:48:04.285 --> 08:48:06.321
JUST BRIEFLY ALSO SPEAK TO THE

08:48:06.388 --> 08:48:07.622
INTER COUNTY TRANSFER ISSUE,

08:48:07.689 --> 08:48:09.057
BECAUSE WE HAVE BOTH COUNTY

08:48:09.124 --> 08:48:10.258
TRANSFERS IN AND OUT OF THE

08:48:10.325 --> 08:48:12.027
STATE. WE HAVE STATE COMPACTS

08:48:12.093 --> 08:48:12.794
FOR YOUTH MOVING AMONG THE

08:48:12.861 --> 08:48:14.029
STATE. BUT WE ALSO HAVE

08:48:14.095 --> 08:48:16.398
INSTANCES WHERE, YOU KNOW, A

08:48:16.464 --> 08:48:17.298
FAMILY IN ONE COUNTY MAY HAVE

08:48:17.365 --> 08:48:18.333
FAMILY THAT MOVES TO ANOTHER

08:48:18.400 --> 08:48:20.268
COUNTY. AND PART OF THAT IS YOU

08:48:20.335 --> 08:48:22.437
HAVE BOTH RULES OF COURT AND

08:48:22.504 --> 08:48:23.471
STATUTE THAT GOVERN HOW THE

08:48:23.538 --> 08:48:24.839
JURISDICTION OF THAT JUVENILE

08:48:24.906 --> 08:48:26.775
CASE IS TRANSFERRED TO MAKE SURE

08:48:26.841 --> 08:48:28.109
THAT THE SERVICES CAN BE

08:48:28.176 --> 08:48:29.644
PROVIDED IN THEIR COUNTY OF

08:48:29.711 --> 08:48:31.613
RESIDENCE AND CLOSE TO HOME. YOU

08:48:31.679 --> 08:48:32.180
ALSO HAVE INSTANCES WHERE A

08:48:32.247 --> 08:48:34.249
YOUTH MAY TRAVEL FOR VACATION

08:48:34.315 --> 08:48:36.484
SOMEWHERE, HAVE A HAVE A CHARGE,

08:48:36.551 --> 08:48:37.919
AN OFFENSE, AND BUT THAT'S NOT

08:48:37.986 --> 08:48:39.821
THE COUNTY IN WHICH THAT THEY

08:48:39.888 --> 08:48:41.289
LIVE. AND SO THESE THINGS ARE

08:48:41.356 --> 08:48:43.224
HAPPENING ALL OF THE TIME. IT'S

08:48:43.291 --> 08:48:44.426
NOT MOU BASED THEIR STATUTE.

08:48:44.492 --> 08:48:45.760
THERE'S RULES OF COURT. AND SO

08:48:45.827 --> 08:48:47.495
THOSE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE

08:48:47.562 --> 08:48:49.097
HAPPENING UNDER THIS. AND SO HOW

08:48:49.164 --> 08:48:49.998
DO WE MAKE SURE, YOU KNOW THOSE

08:48:50.065 --> 08:48:52.033
AREN'T IMPACTED IN A WAY THAT

08:48:52.100 --> 08:48:53.802
JURISDICTION AND SUPERVISION AND

08:48:53.868 --> 08:48:56.204
SERVICES AREN'T AT THE DETRIMENT

08:48:56.271 --> 08:48:57.906
OF THE YOUTH AND COMMUNITY

08:48:57.972 --> 08:49:01.009
SAFETY. IF ANY. ANYTHING ELSE IN

08:49:01.076 --> 08:49:03.044
MR. HANEY, IS THERE AN

08:49:03.111 --> 08:49:04.245
ADDITIONAL ANSWER? YEAH. WELL,

08:49:04.312 --> 08:49:07.449
IN RESPONSE TO THE SENATOR, SHE

08:49:07.515 --> 08:49:09.984
RESPONDED TO HIS QUESTION AND

08:49:10.051 --> 08:49:11.986
ALSO STIPULATED THAT SHE REACHED

08:49:12.053 --> 08:49:13.455
OUT AND NO AMENDMENTS CAME FROM

08:49:13.521 --> 08:49:16.257
THE OPPOSITION. A LOT OF TIMES

08:49:16.324 --> 08:49:17.859
YOU CAN'T MAKE AMENDMENTS UNTIL

08:49:17.926 --> 08:49:19.394
SOMETHING IS CLEAR. AND I

08:49:19.461 --> 08:49:21.496
MENTIONED THAT IN ANY BILL THERE

08:49:21.563 --> 08:49:23.298
SHOULD BE CLARITY. FOR INSTANCE,

08:49:23.364 --> 08:49:24.899
SHE MADE THE STATEMENT THAT

08:49:24.966 --> 08:49:27.302
THERE WOULD BE NO LOSS OF ANY

08:49:27.368 --> 08:49:28.970
CURRENT OFFICERS. RIGHT. AND

08:49:29.037 --> 08:49:30.438
REMEMBER I SAID I WAS

08:49:30.505 --> 08:49:32.340
REPRESENTING A UNION ALSO AS A

08:49:32.407 --> 08:49:36.244
AS A PROBATION OFFICER? NO, NO

08:49:36.311 --> 08:49:37.912
CURRENT OFFICER PROBABLY

08:49:37.979 --> 08:49:38.847
WOULDN'T LOSE THEIR JOB. BUT

08:49:38.913 --> 08:49:40.949
WHAT IF THEY ARE STRETCHING OUT?

08:49:41.015 --> 08:49:42.817
THAT ITEM WOULD BE LOST IN TERMS

08:49:42.884 --> 08:49:44.853
OF A PROBATION OFFICER AND

08:49:44.919 --> 08:49:47.122
REPLACED WITH A NON PROBATION

08:49:47.188 --> 08:49:49.858
OFFICER. THAT IS DILUTING THE

08:49:49.924 --> 08:49:51.626
PROFESSION. THAT'S WHY I SAY

08:49:51.693 --> 08:49:53.528
IT'S AN ATTACK ON PROBATION. IF

08:49:53.595 --> 08:49:55.096
EVERY OFFICER WAS TO RETIRE

08:49:55.163 --> 08:49:57.132
TODAY IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY,

08:49:57.198 --> 08:49:59.234
THEN THEY WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT

08:49:59.300 --> 08:50:00.435
TO REPLACE EVERY OFFICER WITH A

08:50:00.502 --> 08:50:02.237
NON-LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER.

08:50:02.303 --> 08:50:02.971
THEREFORE, YOU WOULD HAVE TO

08:50:03.037 --> 08:50:05.373
CHANGE ALL THE LAWS ON WHO COULD

08:50:05.440 --> 08:50:06.207
DO THE REPRESENTATION. IF YOU

08:50:06.274 --> 08:50:08.243
TALK ABOUT LOSS OF JOBS,

08:50:08.309 --> 08:50:09.978
ACCESSING RECORDS, WHICH WE CALL

08:50:10.044 --> 08:50:12.313
A VIOLATION, WE HAVE CRIMINAL

08:50:12.380 --> 08:50:14.816
OFFENDERS INFORMATION THAT WE

08:50:14.883 --> 08:50:17.385
HAVE UNDER SECURITY. IF YOU GAVE

08:50:17.452 --> 08:50:20.355
THAT ACCESS TO THOSE WHO HAVE

08:50:20.421 --> 08:50:21.923
NOT BEEN STIPULATED BY STATE

08:50:21.990 --> 08:50:24.526
LAW, THEN YOU HAVE IN FACT

08:50:24.592 --> 08:50:26.594
ALLOWED ANOTHER PERSON TO DO

08:50:26.661 --> 08:50:28.763
THAT JOB, WHICH BELONGS TO A

08:50:28.830 --> 08:50:30.865
PEACE OFFICER. SO WHEN I SAY

08:50:30.932 --> 08:50:32.734
IT'S AN ATTACK ON PROBATION, THE

08:50:32.800 --> 08:50:35.236
BILL IN ITSELF, WE DON'T

08:50:35.303 --> 08:50:37.105
DISAGREE THAT THERE ARE PROBLEMS

08:50:37.172 --> 08:50:39.107
IN PROBATION. WHAT WE DISAGREE

08:50:39.174 --> 08:50:41.376
WITH IS IT IS PROBATION. THAT

08:50:41.442 --> 08:50:43.912
SHOULD BE THE ENTITY THAT THE

08:50:43.978 --> 08:50:46.247
STATE HAS ALREADY DICTATED TO

08:50:46.314 --> 08:50:49.317
HELP REFORM YOUTH. NOW, THERE

08:50:49.384 --> 08:50:51.619
WAS TALK ALSO ABOUT

08:50:51.686 --> 08:50:52.554
PROFESSIONALISM AND THERAPEUTICS

08:50:52.620 --> 08:50:55.857
AND BEING ABLE TO PRESENT THAT

08:50:55.924 --> 08:50:57.825
85% OF ALL OF THE OFFICERS IN

08:50:57.892 --> 08:50:59.294
LOS ANGELES COUNTY HAVE A FOUR

08:50:59.360 --> 08:51:01.095
YEAR DEGREE. THAT DOESN'T MEAN

08:51:01.162 --> 08:51:02.197
THAT THEY'RE THE SMARTEST PEOPLE

08:51:02.263 --> 08:51:04.199
IN THE WORLD, BUT IT DOES MEAN

08:51:04.265 --> 08:51:05.433
THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH

08:51:05.500 --> 08:51:07.702
AND ADAPT TO WHATEVER REFORMS WE

08:51:07.769 --> 08:51:11.039
WANT TO DO. DIALECTICAL

08:51:11.105 --> 08:51:13.441
BEHAVIOR, CBT, WE INVOLVE ALL OF

08:51:13.508 --> 08:51:15.944
THAT. PROBATION IS THE LEAST

08:51:16.010 --> 08:51:17.812
RESTRICTED LAW ENFORCEMENT

08:51:17.879 --> 08:51:19.681
AGENCY IN THE STATE OF

08:51:19.747 --> 08:51:21.749
CALIFORNIA. IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY

08:51:21.816 --> 08:51:23.685
FOR YOUTH TO BE REFORMED. IT IS

08:51:23.751 --> 08:51:26.087
NOT A SUPPRESSION OF YOUTH. I'M

08:51:26.154 --> 08:51:27.889
ALSO 50 YEAR RESIDENT. I'M

08:51:27.956 --> 08:51:28.957
CONCERNED ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY.

08:51:29.023 --> 08:51:30.592
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT HOW WE

08:51:30.658 --> 08:51:32.961
RETURN OUR YOUTH TO THE

08:51:33.027 --> 08:51:34.562
COMMUNITY. I LIVE AMONGST THEM.

08:51:34.629 --> 08:51:36.264
AND SO QUITE NATURALLY, I WANT

08:51:36.331 --> 08:51:38.233
THEM TO HAVE THE BEST TREATMENT.

08:51:38.299 --> 08:51:40.802
IT IS THE UNIONS THAT SENT A

08:51:40.868 --> 08:51:43.137
BILL UP HERE TWO YEARS AGO, AB

08:51:43.204 --> 08:51:46.207
SIX, $95 BILLION WE ASKED FOR.

08:51:46.274 --> 08:51:48.276
THAT'S WHEN WE HAD A SURPLUS, OF

08:51:48.343 --> 08:51:50.078
COURSE. WHY? BECAUSE THE

08:51:50.144 --> 08:51:51.946
FACILITIES DO NOT REPRESENT

08:51:52.013 --> 08:51:53.114
THERAPEUTICS. YOU CAN'T BLAME

08:51:53.181 --> 08:51:55.216
THE OFFICERS. FOR WHAT? A

08:51:55.283 --> 08:51:56.684
FACILITY. IF YOU GOT A FACILITY

08:51:56.751 --> 08:51:58.486
IN THE HALLS, ESPECIALLY WHEN

08:51:58.553 --> 08:52:00.622
EACH PERSON DOESN'T HAVE ITS OWN

08:52:00.688 --> 08:52:02.090
RESTROOM, THAT WAS A BIG ISSUE

08:52:02.156 --> 08:52:03.925
RIGHT THEN. YOU CANNOT TALK

08:52:03.992 --> 08:52:06.394
ABOUT IT BEING THE ENVIRONMENT

08:52:06.461 --> 08:52:09.264
THAT IS CAUSED FOR REFORM. SO I

08:52:09.330 --> 08:52:10.331
JUST WANTED TO ADDRESS THOSE

08:52:10.398 --> 08:52:12.166
ISSUES BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THE

08:52:12.233 --> 08:52:14.002
BILL IS CLEAR. I THINK THE BILL

08:52:14.068 --> 08:52:15.803
IS AN ATTACK ON PROBATION.

08:52:15.870 --> 08:52:17.905
PROBATION IS A STATE MANDATED

08:52:17.972 --> 08:52:19.874
ENTITY. AND AGAIN, YOU MAY SOME

08:52:19.941 --> 08:52:21.876
OF YOU ARE PRETTY YOUNG. IF YOU

08:52:21.943 --> 08:52:23.444
GO BACK AND PULL THE PROBATION

08:52:23.511 --> 08:52:26.547
SERVICES TASK FORCE REPORT, 549

08:52:26.614 --> 08:52:28.950
PAGES LONG, 17 RECOMMENDATIONS

08:52:29.017 --> 08:52:30.585
IN THOSE 17 RECOMMENDATIONS AT

08:52:30.652 --> 08:52:33.021
THAT TIME, IF THE STATE AND THE

08:52:33.087 --> 08:52:34.822
COUNTIES WOULD ABIDE BY THOSE

08:52:34.889 --> 08:52:35.890
RECOMMENDATIONS, WE WOULDN'T BE

08:52:35.957 --> 08:52:37.659
HERE TODAY. WE WOULD HAVE

08:52:37.725 --> 08:52:39.460
MINIMUM NEGATIVE ASPECTS IN OUR

08:52:39.527 --> 08:52:42.630
DEPARTMENT. ANYTHING ELSE, MR.

08:52:42.697 --> 08:52:44.532
HANEY? YEAH, JUST JUST JUST JUST

08:52:44.599 --> 08:52:46.434
TO CLOSE ON, I, I APPRECIATE ALL

08:52:46.501 --> 08:52:49.170
OF THAT. I THINK THERE, THERE

08:52:49.237 --> 08:52:51.139
THERE ARE A LOT OF REASONS WHY

08:52:51.205 --> 08:52:53.174
WE COLLECTIVELY HAVE GOT THIS

08:52:53.241 --> 08:52:55.276
WRONG OVER A NUMBER OF DECADES.

08:52:55.343 --> 08:52:57.445
AND IT'S WE GOT IT WRONG, NOT

08:52:57.512 --> 08:52:59.614
JUST IN LA. WE GOT IT WRONG IN

08:52:59.681 --> 08:53:01.382
SAN FRANCISCO. WE GOT IT WRONG

08:53:01.449 --> 08:53:03.384
THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND I

08:53:03.451 --> 08:53:06.187
DON'T THINK THAT FOR ALL OF US

08:53:06.254 --> 08:53:07.822
TO SIT HERE IN THIS BUILDING

08:53:07.889 --> 08:53:09.657
WHERE WE PASSED THE LAWS THAT

08:53:09.724 --> 08:53:11.225
CREATED THESE FRAMEWORKS, WE

08:53:11.292 --> 08:53:12.560
PASSED THE LAWS FOR DECADES THAT

08:53:12.627 --> 08:53:14.629
CREATED THESE INCREDIBLY

08:53:14.696 --> 08:53:16.564
PUNITIVE, DANGEROUS FACILITIES

08:53:16.631 --> 08:53:18.433
FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND SET UP A

08:53:18.499 --> 08:53:19.934
CERTAIN WAY THAT WE WERE DEALING

08:53:20.001 --> 08:53:21.369
WITH THEM THAT WAS VERY HARMFUL

08:53:21.436 --> 08:53:23.071
AND VERY DANGEROUS, THAT WE

08:53:23.137 --> 08:53:25.540
SHOULD SIT UP HERE NOW AND SAY,

08:53:25.606 --> 08:53:29.143
NO, IT'S THE PEOPLE IN PROBATION

08:53:29.210 --> 08:53:31.045
WHO'VE DEDICATED THEIR LIVES TO

08:53:31.112 --> 08:53:32.447
THAT WORK. AND IT'S THEIR IT'S

08:53:32.513 --> 08:53:34.649
THEIR FAULT WHEN THEY'RE BEING

08:53:34.716 --> 08:53:37.151
SENT INTO THESE FACILITIES THAT

08:53:37.218 --> 08:53:38.052
THEMSELVES HAD A CERTAIN MISSION

08:53:38.119 --> 08:53:39.887
AND MANDATE THAT WERE DANGEROUS

08:53:39.954 --> 08:53:42.256
AND FACILITIES IN MANY CASES

08:53:42.323 --> 08:53:44.225
THAT DID NOT, THAT WERE NOT SET

08:53:44.292 --> 08:53:45.760
UP TO HELP PEOPLE, BUT OFTEN

08:53:45.827 --> 08:53:47.261
HURT PEOPLE AND, AND THE LACK OF

08:53:47.328 --> 08:53:48.629
SERVICES, AS YOU SAID,

08:53:48.696 --> 08:53:50.665
THERAPEUTIC OPPORTUNITIES. SO I

08:53:50.732 --> 08:53:53.167
THINK THAT WE, WE HAVE TO FIGURE

08:53:53.234 --> 08:53:55.136
OUT HOW TO GET THIS RIGHT. AND I

08:53:55.203 --> 08:53:57.372
THAT'S WHY I COMMEND THE AUTHOR

08:53:57.438 --> 08:53:59.240
AND COMMEND THE BOARD FOR, FOR

08:53:59.307 --> 08:54:01.275
LOOKING AT THE WAYS TO MAKE THE

08:54:01.342 --> 08:54:03.478
BIGGER CHANGES THAT WE NEED AND

08:54:03.544 --> 08:54:04.846
THE LA MEMBERS AND THE LA

08:54:04.912 --> 08:54:06.914
AUTHOR. I'M THIS WILL ONLY APPLY

08:54:06.981 --> 08:54:09.617
TO LA. I'M GOING TO DEFER TO YOU

08:54:09.684 --> 08:54:10.551
ALL TO CONTINUE THIS

08:54:10.618 --> 08:54:11.953
CONVERSATION. BUT I DO THINK

08:54:12.019 --> 08:54:15.623
THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW

08:54:15.690 --> 08:54:17.692
WE ADDRESS ALL OF THESE BROADER

08:54:17.759 --> 08:54:19.293
ISSUES JUST BY CHANGING A

08:54:19.360 --> 08:54:21.362
DEPARTMENT. THAT FEELS TO ME NOT

08:54:21.429 --> 08:54:22.930
LIKE IT'S GOING TO CHANGE. WHAT

08:54:22.997 --> 08:54:25.466
IS A DEEPER SET OF CHALLENGES

08:54:25.533 --> 08:54:26.467
THAT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED THAT HAVE

08:54:26.534 --> 08:54:28.569
TO BE DONE WITH THE PEOPLE WHO

08:54:28.636 --> 08:54:30.037
ARE DOING THE WORK NOW AND

08:54:30.104 --> 08:54:30.805
PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES, AND

08:54:30.872 --> 08:54:31.939
HAVE DEDICATED THEIR LIFE TO

08:54:32.006 --> 08:54:33.775
THAT, AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE

08:54:33.841 --> 08:54:35.109
FULLY AT THE TABLE AS WELL AS

08:54:35.176 --> 08:54:36.144
ADDRESSING THESE BROADER ISSUES.

08:54:36.210 --> 08:54:38.613
BUT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE

08:54:38.679 --> 08:54:40.982
BILL TODAY, AND I KNOW THAT AND

08:54:41.048 --> 08:54:42.917
SORRY TO SPEND SO MUCH TIME

08:54:42.984 --> 08:54:44.619
SPEAKING, BUT I, I HOPE THAT

08:54:44.685 --> 08:54:45.987
THIS CONVERSATION CONTINUES WITH

08:54:46.053 --> 08:54:47.955
ALL OF THESE FOLKS HERE. AND I

08:54:48.022 --> 08:54:50.625
WISH THAT WE ACCOMPLISH WHAT WE

08:54:50.691 --> 08:54:52.126
ALL WANT TO ACCOMPLISH, WHICH IS

08:54:52.193 --> 08:54:53.060
TO KEEP OUR YOUNG PEOPLE SAFE

08:54:53.127 --> 08:54:55.196
AND KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE, AND

08:54:55.263 --> 08:54:57.331
THAT WE FIND THE BEST WAY TO DO

08:54:57.398 --> 08:54:58.800
THAT. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR.

08:54:58.866 --> 08:54:59.600
THANK YOU, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

08:54:59.667 --> 08:55:01.369
HANEY. MR. VICE CHAIR, YOU'VE

08:55:01.436 --> 08:55:03.171
BEEN WAITING. THE FLOOR IS

08:55:03.237 --> 08:55:09.377
YOURS. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. SO

08:55:09.444 --> 08:55:11.045
I DON'T LIVE IN LA COUNTY, BUT

08:55:11.112 --> 08:55:12.280
LA COUNTY SEEMS TO BRING ISSUES

08:55:12.346 --> 08:55:14.081
HERE ALL THE TIME BECAUSE THEY

08:55:14.148 --> 08:55:15.550
CAN'T FIX IT THEMSELVES. AND WE

08:55:15.616 --> 08:55:17.018
I, WE ALWAYS SEEM TO SEEM TO BE

08:55:17.084 --> 08:55:19.420
THE FIX. I DON'T KNOW WHY. WE

08:55:19.487 --> 08:55:20.421
JUST DON'T HOLD OUR ELECTED

08:55:20.488 --> 08:55:21.222
OFFICIALS ACCOUNTABLE IN LOS

08:55:21.289 --> 08:55:23.191
ANGELES TO MAKE SURE THEY FIX

08:55:23.257 --> 08:55:24.192
THIS, BUT KEEP BRINGING IT TO

08:55:24.258 --> 08:55:27.094
THE STATE AND HAVE THE STATE DO

08:55:27.161 --> 08:55:28.129
IT. THESE NON PEACE OFFICERS

08:55:28.196 --> 08:55:29.096
THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE BRINGING

08:55:29.163 --> 08:55:31.666
IN OR YOU WANT TO BRING IN IN

08:55:31.732 --> 08:55:33.634
THE BILL, DO THEY GO THROUGH

08:55:33.701 --> 08:55:35.069
BACKGROUNDS. THEY GET BETTER

08:55:35.136 --> 08:55:39.006
LIKE ANY COUNTY EMPLOYEE RIGHT

08:55:39.073 --> 08:55:39.907
NOW. BECAUSE THEY'RE COUNTY

08:55:39.974 --> 08:55:41.075
EMPLOYEES. BUT THEY'RE GOING TO

08:55:41.142 --> 08:55:42.877
BE COUNTY EMPLOYEES. BUT THEY'LL

08:55:42.944 --> 08:55:44.479
BE HOLDING A DIFFERENT,

08:55:44.545 --> 08:55:45.880
DIFFERENT TITLE. THEY'LL BE IN

08:55:45.947 --> 08:55:47.615
THEY'LL BE IN THE FACILITY WITH

08:55:47.682 --> 08:55:48.883
OUR CHILDREN. THEY'RE IN THE

08:55:48.950 --> 08:55:50.751
FACILITIES RIGHT NOW. OKAY. SO

08:55:50.818 --> 08:55:51.953
WHAT WILL THEY BE DOING WITH

08:55:52.019 --> 08:55:54.322
THIS BILL? WHAT WILL THEY BE

08:55:54.388 --> 08:55:55.189
DOING IN THE CAMPS, IN THE

08:55:55.256 --> 08:55:56.958
HALLS? SO SOMETIMES THEY DON'T

08:55:57.024 --> 08:55:58.960
GET PERMISSION TO GO INSIDE THE

08:55:59.026 --> 08:56:00.161
HALLS. SOMETIMES THEY DO. IT'S

08:56:00.228 --> 08:56:02.163
UP TO PROBATION. IF THEY WHOEVER

08:56:02.230 --> 08:56:03.631
THEY WANT TO DECIDE TO GO

08:56:03.698 --> 08:56:05.199
INSIDE. NOW, IF THIS BILL WERE

08:56:05.266 --> 08:56:06.567
TO PASS, YOU WOULD HAVE A

08:56:06.634 --> 08:56:08.336
DISCUSSION. MOU DUTIES WOULD BE

08:56:08.402 --> 08:56:10.371
BROKEN UP BETWEEN PROBATION AND

08:56:10.438 --> 08:56:11.539
DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH DEVELOPMENT

08:56:11.606 --> 08:56:13.040
THROUGH LA COUNTY. THAT COULD

08:56:13.107 --> 08:56:14.475
TAKE YEARS. THAT COULD TAKE

08:56:14.542 --> 08:56:15.443
MONTHS, HOWEVER LONG THAT TAKES

08:56:15.510 --> 08:56:17.311
TO DO THOSE DETERMINATIONS. NOW,

08:56:17.378 --> 08:56:20.281
IF D D IS GIVEN A ROLE OF X, Y,

08:56:20.348 --> 08:56:21.883
Z, THEN THE COUNTY WOULD THEN

08:56:21.949 --> 08:56:23.718
HAVE TO PUT MORE STRINGENT

08:56:23.784 --> 08:56:25.286
BACKGROUND CHECKS, MORE

08:56:25.353 --> 08:56:27.088
STRINGENT PROCESS TO GET

08:56:27.154 --> 08:56:28.556
INDIVIDUALS INTO THOSE ROLES.

08:56:28.623 --> 08:56:29.991
BECAUSE D IS NOT A BIG

08:56:30.057 --> 08:56:31.325
DEPARTMENT RIGHT NOW, BUT IT

08:56:31.392 --> 08:56:34.328
WOULD HAVE TO HIRE UP. BUT THIS

08:56:34.395 --> 08:56:35.830
BILL WOULD MAKE THEM A BIGGER

08:56:35.897 --> 08:56:36.898
DEPARTMENT. THIS BILL IS

08:56:36.964 --> 08:56:38.599
PERMISSIVE. SO FOR THE FIRST

08:56:38.666 --> 08:56:40.601
THING THIS BILL COULD DO IS TO

08:56:40.668 --> 08:56:41.636
BRING THOSE PEOPLE TOGETHER IN A

08:56:41.702 --> 08:56:43.070
TABLE AND SAY, HEY, LA COUNTY

08:56:43.137 --> 08:56:46.173
WANTS TO GO AND DO X, Y, Z. NOW

08:56:46.240 --> 08:56:46.941
THESE ARE THE ROLES THAT ARE

08:56:47.008 --> 08:56:49.343
GOING TO BE BROKEN UP BY THESE X

08:56:49.410 --> 08:56:51.279
AMOUNT OF DEPARTMENTS WITH

08:56:51.345 --> 08:56:52.680
PROBATION AND SO FORTH. SO THIS

08:56:52.747 --> 08:56:54.015
IS WHY THE BILL ISN'T

08:56:54.081 --> 08:56:54.715
PRESCRIPTIVE, BECAUSE IT'S UP TO

08:56:54.782 --> 08:56:56.984
THE LA, UP TO LA COUNTY TO

08:56:57.051 --> 08:56:58.686
DETERMINE WHAT THOSE ROLES WILL

08:56:58.753 --> 08:56:59.453
BE. AND THEN DEPENDING ON THOSE

08:56:59.520 --> 08:57:01.188
ROADS THAT LA COUNTY WILL COME

08:57:01.255 --> 08:57:02.857
TOGETHER TO PUT PARAMETERS ON

08:57:02.924 --> 08:57:04.392
THE INDIVIDUALS GOING IN.

08:57:04.458 --> 08:57:05.860
COULDN'T LA COUNTY DO THAT

08:57:05.927 --> 08:57:07.328
WITHOUT US TELLING THEM TO DO

08:57:07.395 --> 08:57:09.096
THAT? NO. STAY IN OUR STATUTE

08:57:09.163 --> 08:57:11.098
RIGHT NOW. IT SAYS THAT ONLY

08:57:11.165 --> 08:57:12.300
PROBATION CAN BE THE LEAD ENTITY

08:57:12.366 --> 08:57:14.068
IN OUR HALLS AND CAMPS, WHICH IS

08:57:14.135 --> 08:57:15.703
WHY WE'RE CHANGING THAT STATUTE.

08:57:15.770 --> 08:57:17.138
SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE CHANGING.

08:57:17.204 --> 08:57:18.472
THAT'S WHY THE STATE'S INVOLVED.

08:57:18.539 --> 08:57:25.046
THAT'S CORRECT OKAY. SO I'M

08:57:25.112 --> 08:57:27.148
CURIOUS. I KNOW WE HAD A LOT OF

08:57:27.214 --> 08:57:29.984
MEETINGS FROM OTHER COUNTIES.

08:57:30.051 --> 08:57:31.452
I'M ASSUMING THAT THEY'RE

08:57:31.519 --> 08:57:32.887
THEY'RE IN OPPOSITION BECAUSE

08:57:32.954 --> 08:57:34.088
THEY'RE IN FEAR THAT THIS IS

08:57:34.155 --> 08:57:36.457
GOING TO HAPPEN TO THEIR COUNTY,

08:57:36.524 --> 08:57:37.992
POTENTIALLY. AND I AND I COULD

08:57:38.059 --> 08:57:39.727
SEE THAT GOING AS WELL. AND AS

08:57:39.794 --> 08:57:41.095
THE POINTS THAT WERE MADE

08:57:41.162 --> 08:57:44.231
EARLIER BY MY COLLEAGUES IN

08:57:44.298 --> 08:57:46.934
REGARDS TO THE PROBLEM'S NOT

08:57:47.001 --> 08:57:48.436
KIND OF REALLY BEING PROBATION'S

08:57:48.502 --> 08:57:49.937
PROBLEM. IT'S BEING MAYBE OUR

08:57:50.004 --> 08:57:53.107
PROBLEMS, MAYBE 109. RIGHT? WE

08:57:53.174 --> 08:57:54.141
ESSENTIALLY MADE PROBATION

08:57:54.208 --> 08:57:56.210
OFFICERS, PAROLE AGENTS AND SO

08:57:56.277 --> 08:57:57.645
WE GIVE THEM EXTRA DUTIES

08:57:57.712 --> 08:57:59.213
WITHOUT THE EXTRA SUPPORT. BUT

08:57:59.280 --> 08:58:00.247
YET SOMEBODY HERE THOUGHT THAT

08:58:00.314 --> 08:58:02.717
WAS A GREAT IDEA. AND NOW WE'RE

08:58:02.783 --> 08:58:05.553
TRYING TO FIX IT. I THINK

08:58:05.620 --> 08:58:06.587
THERE'S OTHER AVENUES THAT WE

08:58:06.654 --> 08:58:08.923
CAN DO TO TRY AND FIX THAT. I

08:58:08.990 --> 08:58:10.791
DON'T I DON'T KNOW IF BRINGING

08:58:10.858 --> 08:58:14.362
IN OTHER NON PEACE OFFICERS AND,

08:58:14.428 --> 08:58:16.530
AND TO DO THAT IS GOING TO BE

08:58:16.597 --> 08:58:19.767
THE SOLUTION. I CAN SEE THE

08:58:19.834 --> 08:58:21.335
POINT THAT THE PROBATION OFFICER

08:58:21.402 --> 08:58:23.437
HERE HAD MADE ABOUT LOSING JOBS.

08:58:23.504 --> 08:58:24.739
YES. CURRENTLY THE ONES THAT

08:58:24.805 --> 08:58:26.974
HAVE THEM WILL KEEP THEIR JOBS.

08:58:27.041 --> 08:58:27.908
BUT THESE NON PEACE OFFICERS

08:58:27.975 --> 08:58:33.981
WILL BE TAKING THEIR POSITIONS.

08:58:34.048 --> 08:58:35.449
MAY I RESPOND TO THAT. YES

08:58:35.516 --> 08:58:37.752
PLEASE. PLEASE. SO WE HAVE AN

08:58:37.818 --> 08:58:38.386
AMENDMENT IN THE BILL THAT SAYS

08:58:38.452 --> 08:58:40.921
NO PEACE OFFICER ROLE CAN BE

08:58:40.988 --> 08:58:42.590
REPLACED BY A NON PEACE OFFICER.

08:58:42.657 --> 08:58:43.424
SO TO THE POINT THAT SOMEONE

08:58:43.491 --> 08:58:44.125
RETIRES THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE

08:58:44.191 --> 08:58:46.694
REPLACED BY A PEACE OFFICER. AND

08:58:46.761 --> 08:58:48.029
SO LET'S JUST SAY THE MAGIC

08:58:48.095 --> 08:58:50.398
NUMBER FOR PROBATION OFFICERS IS

08:58:50.464 --> 08:58:51.799
1000. SO WILL IT STAY 1000 THE

08:58:51.866 --> 08:58:53.601
WHOLE TIME. OR WOULD THIS NEW

08:58:53.668 --> 08:58:55.936
MOU AGREEMENT POSSIBLY BRING IT

08:58:56.003 --> 08:58:57.872
DOWN TO LIKE 500? IT WOULD

08:58:57.938 --> 08:58:58.939
DEPEND. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIGHT.

08:58:59.006 --> 08:59:00.174
IT DEPENDS. THE AMOUNT OF

08:59:00.241 --> 08:59:02.443
JUVENILES ARE IN THE HALLS. IT

08:59:02.510 --> 08:59:03.044
DEPENDS ON WHAT L.A. COUNTY

08:59:03.110 --> 08:59:04.245
DEEMS AS THE NECESSARY TO RUN

08:59:04.311 --> 08:59:05.112
THESE JUVENILE HALLS. THEY'VE

08:59:05.179 --> 08:59:06.847
BEEN HIRING FOR A LONG TIME.

08:59:06.914 --> 08:59:08.115
THEY JUST AREN'T ABLE TO FILL

08:59:08.182 --> 08:59:09.383
THOSE VACANT ROLES. HOWEVER, I

08:59:09.450 --> 08:59:11.218
DO WANT TO AGREE WITH THE

08:59:11.285 --> 08:59:12.887
OPPONENTS TO SAY THAT IT IS A

08:59:12.953 --> 08:59:14.321
VERY DIFFICULT JOB AND THEY'RE

08:59:14.388 --> 08:59:15.289
NOT THERE. NO ONE IS RECEIVING

08:59:15.356 --> 08:59:17.124
THE SUPPORT. NEITHER THE

08:59:17.191 --> 08:59:18.092
JUVENILES OR THE PROBATION

08:59:18.159 --> 08:59:18.793
OFFICERS ARE RECEIVING THE

08:59:18.859 --> 08:59:20.494
SUPPORT TO RUN A FACILITY AS

08:59:20.561 --> 08:59:22.763
ADEQUATE AS IT CAN BE. I'M NOT

08:59:22.830 --> 08:59:23.798
SAYING THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO

08:59:23.864 --> 08:59:26.300
DECIDE TO PUT ON A UNIFORM WITH

08:59:26.367 --> 08:59:29.904
WHATEVER ROLE AREN'T, IN MY

08:59:29.970 --> 08:59:31.605
OPINION, A LITTLE BETTER THAN

08:59:31.672 --> 08:59:33.307
THE REST BECAUSE WE'RE NOT, YOU

08:59:33.374 --> 08:59:34.875
KNOW, IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF

08:59:34.942 --> 08:59:36.343
KIND OF CRAZY TO BE IN THE

08:59:36.410 --> 08:59:37.144
MILITARY OR LAW ENFORCEMENT.

08:59:37.211 --> 08:59:39.313
RIGHT? BUT IT'S TO SAY THAT WE

08:59:39.380 --> 08:59:40.915
KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE HURTING WITH

08:59:40.981 --> 08:59:43.217
STAFFING. YOU NEED SUPPORT. THIS

08:59:43.284 --> 08:59:45.419
IS SUPPLEMENTAL. IT'S NOT TO

08:59:45.486 --> 08:59:46.420
SUPPLEMENT OR THAT'S NOT WORD.

08:59:46.487 --> 08:59:48.089
IT'S A PLANT THING. THAT'S WHAT

08:59:48.155 --> 08:59:53.527
I'M LOOKING FOR. THESE POSITIONS

08:59:53.594 --> 08:59:55.963
WHO WHO OVERSEES THE DEPARTMENT

08:59:56.030 --> 08:59:58.599
OF YOUTH DEVELOPMENT, L.A.

08:59:58.666 --> 09:00:01.469
COUNTY IS A COUNTY DEPARTMENT.

09:00:01.535 --> 09:00:02.369
DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH DEPARTMENT,

09:00:02.436 --> 09:00:03.604
A DEPARTMENT HEAD. I MEAN,

09:00:03.671 --> 09:00:04.772
AGAIN, THERE IS THERE IS AN

09:00:04.839 --> 09:00:06.273
APPOINTED HEAD TO THAT

09:00:06.340 --> 09:00:07.308
DEPARTMENT RIGHT NOW. AND WHO

09:00:07.374 --> 09:00:08.809
APPOINTS THEM? THE COUNTY BOARD

09:00:08.876 --> 09:00:10.745
OF SUPERVISORS. AND HOW LONG? WE

09:00:10.811 --> 09:00:13.380
JUST HAD A BILL ABOUT THAT. HOW

09:00:13.447 --> 09:00:14.014
LONG IS THAT TERM? THERE'S NO

09:00:14.081 --> 09:00:15.983
TERM LIMIT, SIR. SO NO TERM

09:00:16.050 --> 09:00:17.284
LIMIT. INDEFINITE UNTIL UNTIL

09:00:17.351 --> 09:00:20.154
THEY'RE REMOVED BY VOTE THROUGH

09:00:20.221 --> 09:00:21.856
THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS.

09:00:21.922 --> 09:00:23.791
CORRECT. OKAY. SO ANOTHER

09:00:23.858 --> 09:00:24.992
UNAPPOINTED PERSON APPOINTED

09:00:25.059 --> 09:00:27.261
UNELECTED AN APPOINTED POSITION.

09:00:27.328 --> 09:00:28.863
AND HOW DO THEY HOW DOES THE

09:00:28.929 --> 09:00:30.431
DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH DEVELOPMENT,

09:00:30.498 --> 09:00:33.901
HOW DO THEY HOW DOES DISCIPLINE

09:00:33.968 --> 09:00:36.203
WORK FOR THEM? HOW ARE THERE

09:00:36.270 --> 09:00:37.238
ISSUES THAT THAT ARE TAKEN CARE

09:00:37.304 --> 09:00:39.106
OF WITH THEM AS AS THEY WOULD

09:00:39.173 --> 09:00:40.841
WITH PROBATION? I THINK IT'S

09:00:40.908 --> 09:00:42.309
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE WAY

09:00:42.376 --> 09:00:44.512
THE BILL IS WRITTEN, ALL OR SOME

09:00:44.578 --> 09:00:46.413
OF THE DUTIES OF THE CHIEF

09:00:46.480 --> 09:00:48.749
PROBATION OFFICER WILL BE GIVEN

09:00:48.816 --> 09:00:50.584
TO THE DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH

09:00:50.651 --> 09:00:51.485
DEVELOPMENT, BUT NO DUTY THAT IS

09:00:51.552 --> 09:00:53.354
PERFORMED BY A PEACE OFFICER CAN

09:00:53.420 --> 09:00:55.990
BE DELEGATED. SO THEY'RE NOT

09:00:56.056 --> 09:00:57.691
GOING TO BE OPERATING OR

09:00:57.758 --> 09:00:59.059
SECURING THE HALLS OR

09:00:59.126 --> 09:01:00.060
FACILITIES. THAT'S NOT THE

09:01:00.127 --> 09:01:02.863
INTENT OF THIS. THE INTENT IS TO

09:01:02.930 --> 09:01:04.565
ENSURE THAT THE YOUTH ARE

09:01:04.632 --> 09:01:06.433
GETTING CONNECTED TO SERVICES

09:01:06.500 --> 09:01:08.169
THAT THEY NEED. BECAUSE OF THE

09:01:08.235 --> 09:01:09.937
SHORTAGE OF STAFFING, AND EVEN

09:01:10.004 --> 09:01:12.173
WE HAVE TRIED BONUSES TO

09:01:12.239 --> 09:01:13.407
INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO SIGN ON.

09:01:13.474 --> 09:01:15.075
WE CANNOT HIRE ENOUGH. WE WANT

09:01:15.142 --> 09:01:17.511
TO HIRE MORE. AND BECAUSE OF A

09:01:17.578 --> 09:01:19.680
CULTURE OF CALL OUT, THERE'S NOT

09:01:19.747 --> 09:01:21.849
ENOUGH PEOPLE THERE TO BOTH

09:01:21.916 --> 09:01:23.617
SECURE THE FACILITIES AND

09:01:23.684 --> 09:01:24.919
PROVIDE THE YOUTH WITH THE

09:01:24.985 --> 09:01:26.153
SERVICES THEY NEED. AND I THINK

09:01:26.220 --> 09:01:28.289
THE VISION FOR THE BOARD IS THAT

09:01:28.355 --> 09:01:29.356
THIS BILL WOULD DO THAT. IT

09:01:29.423 --> 09:01:31.492
WOULD IT WOULD SUPPORT OUR

09:01:31.559 --> 09:01:32.960
PROBATION OFFICERS BY DOING THE

09:01:33.027 --> 09:01:35.262
THING THAT MAYBE DID DOES

09:01:35.329 --> 09:01:36.564
BETTER, WHICH IS THE SERVICES,

09:01:36.630 --> 09:01:38.699
AND CONNECTING THEM TO THOSE

09:01:38.766 --> 09:01:40.968
SERVICES. AND THE PROBATION

09:01:41.035 --> 09:01:42.336
OFFICERS THERE WILL DO THEIR

09:01:42.403 --> 09:01:44.171
PRIMARY DUTY AS PEACE OFFICERS

09:01:44.238 --> 09:01:45.306
BY SECURING THE FACILITIES. I

09:01:45.372 --> 09:01:46.740
THINK THAT WAS THE VISION. DON'T

09:01:46.807 --> 09:01:48.709
YOU GUYS ALREADY HAVE COMMUNITY

09:01:48.776 --> 09:01:49.310
BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE

09:01:49.376 --> 09:01:51.345
CONTRACTED TO DO THAT THROUGH D

09:01:51.412 --> 09:01:53.047
ID? SO WHAT IS WRONG WITH THEM?

09:01:53.113 --> 09:01:54.281
NOT EVERYONE IS ALLOWED TO

09:01:54.348 --> 09:01:55.749
ENTER. IT'S WHENEVER PROBATION

09:01:55.816 --> 09:01:56.984
FEELS LIKE WHOEVER IS ON DUTY

09:01:57.051 --> 09:01:58.986
THAT DAY GETS TO DECIDE WHO

09:01:59.053 --> 09:02:01.255
BRINGS THEM IN OR NOT. AND SO

09:02:01.322 --> 09:02:02.223
HAVE WE TALKED TO PROBATION

09:02:02.289 --> 09:02:03.490
ABOUT THAT AND MAYBE WORKING

09:02:03.557 --> 09:02:05.860
WITH THEM TO DO THAT. SIR, I'VE

09:02:05.926 --> 09:02:06.493
HAD TWO INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS

09:02:06.560 --> 09:02:08.696
ON THIS. I'VE BEEN WORKING ON

09:02:08.762 --> 09:02:10.097
THIS FOR THREE YEARS, SIR. I'VE

09:02:10.164 --> 09:02:12.299
HAD VARIOUS CONVERSATIONS ON

09:02:12.366 --> 09:02:15.135
THIS. I'VE VISITED I'VE TALKED

09:02:15.202 --> 09:02:16.737
OPPOSITION. DO YOU HAVE A

09:02:16.804 --> 09:02:20.241
RESPONSE TO THAT? YES. FIRST

09:02:20.307 --> 09:02:22.042
THING I'LL SAY, THE D D

09:02:22.109 --> 09:02:23.444
DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH DEVELOPMENT

09:02:23.510 --> 09:02:27.047
CAME INTO EXISTENCE LATE 2022.

09:02:27.114 --> 09:02:30.384
IT HAS YET TO BE ESTABLISHED AS

09:02:30.451 --> 09:02:33.420
AN EVIDENCE BASED ENTITY. THEY

09:02:33.487 --> 09:02:36.490
ARE AND THEY DO HAVE ACCESS

09:02:36.557 --> 09:02:38.559
CURRENTLY INTO THE PROBATION

09:02:38.626 --> 09:02:39.760
DEPARTMENT. SOMETIME THEY ARE

09:02:39.827 --> 09:02:41.528
NOT ALLOWED BECAUSE THEY MAY

09:02:41.595 --> 09:02:44.999
HAVE A FELONY THAT'S STILL WON'T

09:02:45.065 --> 09:02:47.601
ALLOW YOU TO BE AROUND KIDS.

09:02:47.668 --> 09:02:49.203
WAIT A MINUTE. I WAS JUST TOLD

09:02:49.270 --> 09:02:50.537
THERE WAS BACKGROUND CHECKS.

09:02:50.604 --> 09:02:52.206
WELL, AGAIN, THOSE ARE COUNTY

09:02:52.273 --> 09:02:53.507
BACKGROUND CHECKS, NOT PEACE

09:02:53.574 --> 09:02:56.577
OFFICER BACKGROUND CHECKS. LAW

09:02:56.644 --> 09:03:00.915
ENFORCEMENT. ALSO, LOS ANGELES

09:03:00.981 --> 09:03:04.485
COUNTY IN THE LAST 4 TO 5 YEARS

09:03:04.551 --> 09:03:06.854
CONTRACT WITH CBOS TO THE TUNE

09:03:06.921 --> 09:03:09.823
OF OVER $75 MILLION A YEAR. AND

09:03:09.890 --> 09:03:11.625
ALL THE WORK THAT A PEACE

09:03:11.692 --> 09:03:15.296
OFFICER CANNOT DO IS BEING DONE

09:03:15.362 --> 09:03:19.466
BY CBOS AND FBOS AND OTHER

09:03:19.533 --> 09:03:22.503
PEOPLE WHO SUPPLY SPECIALTIES IN

09:03:22.569 --> 09:03:24.271
CERTAIN AREAS, SUCH AS ANGER

09:03:24.338 --> 09:03:26.373
MANAGEMENT, ART HISTORY, THING,

09:03:26.440 --> 09:03:28.142
VOCATIONAL SKILLS. SO WE DO THAT

09:03:28.208 --> 09:03:29.743
ALREADY. AND THAT'S WHY I SAY,

09:03:29.810 --> 09:03:32.112
AGAIN, IF YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK

09:03:32.179 --> 09:03:34.014
AT DOING SOMETHING TO HELP THE

09:03:34.081 --> 09:03:36.550
YOUTH IN CALIFORNIA, PROBATION

09:03:36.617 --> 09:03:38.886
IS THE STATE MANDATED ENTITY.

09:03:38.953 --> 09:03:41.221
THEY ARE REFORMS THAT HAVE NOT

09:03:41.288 --> 09:03:43.290
BEEN ADHERED TO. IT WOULD BE

09:03:43.357 --> 09:03:46.560
BETTER IF THE AUTHOR WOULD WORK

09:03:46.627 --> 09:03:48.462
INSIDE THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT.

09:03:48.529 --> 09:03:49.964
WE ALREADY DO THE THINGS THAT

09:03:50.030 --> 09:03:51.565
THEY ARE ASKING TO BE DONE.

09:03:51.632 --> 09:03:55.402
THERE ARE NO MORE SERVICES THAT

09:03:55.469 --> 09:03:57.705
NEED TO BE DONE BY NON-LAW

09:03:57.771 --> 09:03:59.106
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS THAT ARE

09:03:59.173 --> 09:04:02.242
NOT ALREADY GIVEN TO THE DIED,

09:04:02.309 --> 09:04:05.379
ALONG WITH MANY OTHER CBOS. AND

09:04:05.446 --> 09:04:07.181
SO WE DON'T UNDERSTAND. AGAIN,

09:04:07.247 --> 09:04:09.016
I'LL GO BACK TO THE CLARITY OF

09:04:09.083 --> 09:04:10.517
THE BILL. IF YOU WANT TO ATTACK

09:04:10.584 --> 09:04:13.520
A PROBLEM, ATTACK IT THE PROPER

09:04:13.587 --> 09:04:15.622
WAY. IT'S NOTHING WRONG WITH

09:04:15.689 --> 09:04:17.491
OPPOSING THE BILL OR GOING BACK

09:04:17.558 --> 09:04:19.093
TO THE AUTHOR TO WORK WITH THE

09:04:19.159 --> 09:04:21.562
BILL AND SAY, LOOK, YOU'RE YOU

09:04:21.628 --> 09:04:23.597
MISSED, DIRECTED AND IT'S

09:04:23.664 --> 09:04:25.866
MISLED. AND WE COULD TALK ABOUT

09:04:25.933 --> 09:04:27.434
ALL THE TECHNICALITIES. WE COULD

09:04:27.501 --> 09:04:30.070
TALK ABOUT WHO WHO'S, YOU KNOW,

09:04:30.137 --> 09:04:31.872
WHY DID THIS HAPPEN? YOU KNOW,

09:04:31.939 --> 09:04:34.341
I'VE BEEN EMPLOYED 33 YEARS. I

09:04:34.408 --> 09:04:35.843
CAN TELL YOU FOR YEARS, THE

09:04:35.909 --> 09:04:38.112
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN THE

09:04:38.178 --> 09:04:39.947
MENTALITY OR THE IDEOLOGY

09:04:40.014 --> 09:04:40.814
THROUGH WHAT WE CALL

09:04:40.881 --> 09:04:42.983
ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION

09:04:43.050 --> 09:04:45.853
AND OTHER GROUPS HAVE BEEN

09:04:45.919 --> 09:04:47.254
PUSHED TO BELIEVE THAT NO YOUTH

09:04:47.321 --> 09:04:50.591
IS GOING TO COMMIT ANY LEVEL

09:04:50.657 --> 09:04:52.326
CRIME THAT NEED TO BE

09:04:52.393 --> 09:04:53.794
INCARCERATED. PROBATION DOES NOT

09:04:53.861 --> 09:04:55.562
INCARCERATE THE COURT,

09:04:55.629 --> 09:04:58.065
INCARCERATE. BUT IF YOU WANT TO

09:04:58.132 --> 09:04:59.333
GET PROBATION OR IF YOU WANT TO

09:04:59.400 --> 09:05:01.468
LOOK AT PROBATION IN A DIFFERENT

09:05:01.535 --> 09:05:03.103
LIGHT. TEN YEARS AGO, L.A.

09:05:03.170 --> 09:05:05.239
COUNTY USED TO HOUSE 3000 YOUTH

09:05:05.305 --> 09:05:08.275
AT ANY ONE TIME. WE DO NOT. WE

09:05:08.342 --> 09:05:10.477
BARELY GET OVER BETWEEN 500 TO

09:05:10.544 --> 09:05:12.913
600, WHICH IS 707 B OFFENSES,

09:05:12.980 --> 09:05:15.482
HIGH LEVEL RAPE, MURDER, THINGS

09:05:15.549 --> 09:05:17.851
OF THAT SORT. AND WHEN WE TAKE

09:05:17.918 --> 09:05:19.053
THEM IN AGAIN, WE DON'T SUPPRESS

09:05:19.119 --> 09:05:21.288
THEM. I LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY.

09:05:21.355 --> 09:05:22.656
MOST OF THE PROBATION OFFICERS

09:05:22.723 --> 09:05:23.824
LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY. WE TRY TO

09:05:23.891 --> 09:05:25.592
GIVE THEM THE LEVEL OF SERVICES

09:05:25.659 --> 09:05:27.327
THEY NEED SO THAT WHEN THEY GO

09:05:27.394 --> 09:05:29.129
BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY, THE

09:05:29.196 --> 09:05:31.265
VICTIMS FEEL COMFORTABLE, THE

09:05:31.331 --> 09:05:32.800
COMMUNITY FEEL COMFORTABLE, AND

09:05:32.866 --> 09:05:34.034
THE PROBATION OFFICER FEEL

09:05:34.101 --> 09:05:35.202
COMFORTABLE THAT THEY DID

09:05:35.269 --> 09:05:36.603
APPROPRIATE JOB. SO WE DON'T

09:05:36.670 --> 09:05:38.105
UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WANT TO

09:05:38.172 --> 09:05:39.740
INCORPORATE AND USE AN ENTITY

09:05:39.807 --> 09:05:41.675
THAT'S ONLY BEEN IN EXISTENCE

09:05:41.742 --> 09:05:44.611
LESS THAN THREE YEARS. IT HAS NO

09:05:44.678 --> 09:05:46.346
EVIDENCE BASED ANALYSIS AT THIS

09:05:46.413 --> 09:05:48.916
POINT. IT TALKS ABOUT 95%

09:05:48.982 --> 09:05:51.618
SUCCESS RATIO. THOSE ARE NOT

09:05:51.685 --> 09:05:54.188
INCARCERATED 707 B OFFENDERS.

09:05:54.254 --> 09:05:56.824
AND SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND CAN I?

09:05:56.890 --> 09:05:58.992
I'M GOING TO GO TO YOU IN A

09:05:59.059 --> 09:06:00.527
MINUTE. BUT REAL QUICK. THREE

09:06:00.594 --> 09:06:01.929
YEARS THIS THIS BUSINESS HAS

09:06:01.995 --> 09:06:04.565
BEEN AROUND. THEY CAME IN AND I

09:06:04.631 --> 09:06:07.267
THINK SEPTEMBER OF 2022 AND THEY

09:06:07.334 --> 09:06:10.104
JUST FINALLY GOT A DIRECTOR THAT

09:06:10.170 --> 09:06:11.438
MAYBE I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE

09:06:11.505 --> 09:06:13.006
PERMANENT YET OR INTERIM

09:06:13.073 --> 09:06:14.408
PERMANENT AND PERMANENT. THEY'RE

09:06:14.475 --> 09:06:16.577
FINALLY PERMANENT. AND THEY WANT

09:06:16.643 --> 09:06:19.379
TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT THAT

09:06:19.446 --> 09:06:20.080
PERSON HAS THE ABILITY TO RUN

09:06:20.147 --> 09:06:22.082
THE LARGEST PROBATION DEPARTMENT

09:06:22.149 --> 09:06:24.251
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO.

09:06:24.318 --> 09:06:25.319
SO IF THEY'D ONLY BEEN DOING

09:06:25.385 --> 09:06:26.787
THIS THREE YEARS, WHO'S WHO WAS

09:06:26.854 --> 09:06:30.023
DOING IT BEFORE THAT? WHO WAS

09:06:30.090 --> 09:06:31.592
I'M SORRY, WHO WAS THE COMPANY

09:06:31.658 --> 09:06:35.095
BEFORE THIS THAT TOOK CARE OF OR

09:06:35.162 --> 09:06:35.829
THIS DEPARTMENT THAT TOOK CARE

09:06:35.896 --> 09:06:38.232
OF THIS OR DID IT JUST. IS THAT

09:06:38.298 --> 09:06:40.367
TÃI? YEAH. WE JUST I'M SORRY. WE

09:06:40.434 --> 09:06:41.535
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE WAS NO

09:06:41.602 --> 09:06:42.936
DIED. THERE IS NO DIED. THERE

09:06:43.003 --> 09:06:44.638
WAS NO DIED. WE JUST CONTRACT

09:06:44.705 --> 09:06:47.207
WITH CBOS. IF THE IF THE

09:06:47.274 --> 09:06:48.008
PROBATION DEPARTMENT THOUGHT

09:06:48.075 --> 09:06:49.610
THEY HAD A PRODUCT THAT WAS

09:06:49.676 --> 09:06:51.111
WORTHY TO MEET THE COURT'S

09:06:51.178 --> 09:06:52.479
MANDATE AND REQUIREMENTS, WE

09:06:52.546 --> 09:06:53.981
WOULD CONTRACT WITH THOSE CBOS.

09:06:54.047 --> 09:06:55.382
WE STILL CONTRACT WITH THOSE

09:06:55.449 --> 09:06:57.618
CBOS. BUT NOW THE COUNTY, WHICH

09:06:57.684 --> 09:06:59.453
BOTH ENTITIES ARE UNDER THE

09:06:59.520 --> 09:07:01.155
COUNTY, THE COUNTY HAS DIRECTED

09:07:01.221 --> 09:07:03.023
PROBATION TO INTERACT WITH DIED.

09:07:03.090 --> 09:07:05.125
AND WE DO INTERACT WITH DIED. WE

09:07:05.192 --> 09:07:06.326
ALLOW THEM TO BRING IN. THEY

09:07:06.393 --> 09:07:08.462
DON'T HAVE PERMANENT STAFF.

09:07:08.529 --> 09:07:09.930
THAT'S A RANK AND FILE. I DON'T

09:07:09.997 --> 09:07:11.598
BELIEVE THEY HAVE A LOT OF

09:07:11.665 --> 09:07:13.167
MANAGEMENT STAFF. THEY CONTRACT

09:07:13.233 --> 09:07:14.935
OUT WITH CBOS AND THEN ASK THOSE

09:07:15.002 --> 09:07:16.737
CBOS TO COME OVER AS IF THEY

09:07:16.803 --> 09:07:18.205
WORK FOR DIED. AND THOSE CBOS

09:07:18.272 --> 09:07:19.306
AREN'T ALLOWED TO COME INTO

09:07:19.373 --> 09:07:20.474
CERTAIN FACILITIES OR PORTIONS

09:07:20.541 --> 09:07:22.142
OF THE FACILITIES BECAUSE THEY

09:07:22.209 --> 09:07:23.510
HAVE FELONS. I'M SORRY. THEY

09:07:23.577 --> 09:07:24.811
HAVE FELONS THAT ARE THEY HAVE

09:07:24.878 --> 09:07:26.079
PEOPLE WHO HAVE FELONIES. THEY

09:07:26.146 --> 09:07:28.215
HAVE WHAT THEY CALL A CREDIBLE

09:07:28.282 --> 09:07:29.049
MESSENGER. CREDIBLE MESSENGER.

09:07:29.116 --> 09:07:30.017
CREDIBLE MESSENGER IS ONE WHO

09:07:30.083 --> 09:07:31.885
HAS BEEN INCARCERATED AND NOW IS

09:07:31.952 --> 09:07:33.654
OUT, AND THEY CAN DELIVER THE

09:07:33.720 --> 09:07:35.556
MESSAGE OF WHY THEY SHOULD NOT

09:07:35.622 --> 09:07:36.823
BE INCARCERATED. AND THAT'S A

09:07:36.890 --> 09:07:38.292
GREAT THING. BUT SOMETIME IF

09:07:38.358 --> 09:07:40.060
YOU'RE LOOKING AT INDIVIDUALS,

09:07:40.127 --> 09:07:41.361
THEY HAVE BEEN STOPPED BY THE

09:07:41.428 --> 09:07:44.064
PROBATION DEPARTMENT BECAUSE OF

09:07:44.131 --> 09:07:45.732
CERTAIN LEVEL OF HISTORY AT THAT

09:07:45.799 --> 09:07:47.034
POINT. AND WHEN THEY GET

09:07:47.100 --> 09:07:48.869
CLEARED, THEY'RE ALLOWED TO COME

09:07:48.936 --> 09:07:49.403
IN ALSO. I'M NOT THAT'S A

09:07:49.469 --> 09:07:51.004
MANAGEMENT ISSUE, OKAY. AND NOT

09:07:51.071 --> 09:07:52.873
A RANK THAT MAKES SENSE. MISS

09:07:52.940 --> 09:07:54.274
SANCHEZ. AND THEN I KNOW,

09:07:54.341 --> 09:07:55.042
SENATOR, YOU WANT TO REPLY.

09:07:55.108 --> 09:07:56.977
YEAH. JUST THROUGH THE CHAIR, IF

09:07:57.044 --> 09:07:57.844
I MAY, JUST TO SPEAK TO YOUR

09:07:57.911 --> 09:08:00.314
QUESTION ABOUT THE PEACE OFFICER

09:08:00.380 --> 09:08:01.682
ISSUE, YOU KNOW, THE BILL

09:08:01.748 --> 09:08:03.250
REFERENCES THAT PEACE OFFICER

09:08:03.317 --> 09:08:05.118
DUTIES PURSUANT TO PC 830 CANNOT

09:08:05.185 --> 09:08:07.521
BE TRANSFERRED. AS YOU KNOW, PC

09:08:07.588 --> 09:08:09.623
830 KIND OF IS THE SECTION THAT

09:08:09.690 --> 09:08:11.558
DEFINES A NUMBER OF PEACE

09:08:11.625 --> 09:08:13.227
OFFICERS. BUT PROBATION OFFICERS

09:08:13.293 --> 09:08:14.661
ARE CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICERS,

09:08:14.728 --> 09:08:16.563
AND PROBATION DEPARTMENTS ARE

09:08:16.630 --> 09:08:17.497
REFERENCED THROUGHOUT THE

09:08:17.564 --> 09:08:18.966
ENTIRETY OF THE WELFARE AND

09:08:19.032 --> 09:08:20.300
INSTITUTIONS CODE FOR THE DUTIES

09:08:20.367 --> 09:08:22.736
THAT WE DO, BOTH IN RELATION TO,

09:08:22.803 --> 09:08:24.271
YOU KNOW, THINGS ON THE FRONT

09:08:24.338 --> 09:08:26.907
END. PREVENTION, DIVERSION, BUT

09:08:26.974 --> 09:08:29.176
ALSO IN RELATION TO OUR ORDERS

09:08:29.243 --> 09:08:30.677
WITH THE COURT AND SUPERVISION

09:08:30.744 --> 09:08:31.845
AND JUVENILE FACILITIES. SO YOU

09:08:31.912 --> 09:08:33.680
CAN'T REALLY KIND OF PARSE OUT

09:08:33.747 --> 09:08:35.249
WHAT IS A PEACE OFFICER NON

09:08:35.315 --> 09:08:37.251
PEACE OFFICER DUTY, BECAUSE THE

09:08:37.317 --> 09:08:39.186
MISSION OF PROBATION AND

09:08:39.253 --> 09:08:40.520
PROBATION AS A CALIFORNIA PEACE

09:08:40.587 --> 09:08:41.922
OFFICER GO HAND IN HAND. AND SO

09:08:41.989 --> 09:08:44.358
I THINK THAT AMENDMENT FROM

09:08:44.424 --> 09:08:46.360
CPUC'S PERSPECTIVE DOESN'T,

09:08:46.426 --> 09:08:47.427
DOESN'T HAVE THE OUTCOME

09:08:47.494 --> 09:08:48.795
INTENDED TO SAY THAT DUTIES

09:08:48.862 --> 09:08:50.631
CAN'T MOVE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T

09:08:50.697 --> 09:08:51.598
KIND OF THERE'S THAT INTERPLAY

09:08:51.665 --> 09:08:53.267
THAT YOU CAN'T DELINK. THE ONE

09:08:53.333 --> 09:08:55.602
OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT

09:08:55.669 --> 09:08:56.837
THE, YOU KNOW, AS IT WAS SHARED

09:08:56.903 --> 09:08:58.105
THAT THAT THIS IS INTENDED TO

09:08:58.171 --> 09:09:00.574
KIND OF BE BE SUPPLEMENTAL TO

09:09:00.641 --> 09:09:01.475
PROBATION, YOU KNOW, COUNTIES

09:09:01.541 --> 09:09:03.076
THROUGHOUT THE STATE DO THIS NOW

09:09:03.143 --> 09:09:05.045
THEY WORK ACROSS MULTI

09:09:05.112 --> 09:09:05.812
DISCIPLINES WITH COUNTY

09:09:05.879 --> 09:09:07.481
PARTNERS, AGAIN WITH

09:09:07.547 --> 09:09:09.516
NON-GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES TO

09:09:09.583 --> 09:09:10.851
BRING SERVICES TO BEAR IN

09:09:10.917 --> 09:09:12.619
COORDINATION. AND SO, YOU KNOW,

09:09:12.686 --> 09:09:14.788
THIS BILL IS NOT NEEDED TO

09:09:14.855 --> 09:09:15.922
EFFECTUATE THAT. WHAT THE BILL

09:09:15.989 --> 09:09:17.090
WOULD DO IS CHANGE THE

09:09:17.157 --> 09:09:19.660
GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION ON

09:09:19.726 --> 09:09:23.263
PROBATION DUTIES TO TRANSFER TO

09:09:23.330 --> 09:09:24.765
A DIFFERENT ENTITY. SO THERE IS

09:09:24.831 --> 09:09:27.000
ANOTHER PATH. YES. THESE YOU

09:09:27.067 --> 09:09:29.469
KNOW, CROSS CROSS COLLABORATION

09:09:29.536 --> 09:09:30.704
IS HAPPENING AGAIN ACROSS THE

09:09:30.771 --> 09:09:32.205
STATE NOW. AND I THINK, YOU

09:09:32.272 --> 09:09:34.841
KNOW, THE GOAL OF COORDINATING

09:09:34.908 --> 09:09:36.710
SERVICES AND WORKING TOGETHER,

09:09:36.777 --> 09:09:38.445
THAT CAN AND DOES HAPPEN WITHOUT

09:09:38.512 --> 09:09:39.980
THIS BILL. THIS BILL TAKES THE

09:09:40.047 --> 09:09:41.081
STEP OF CHANGING THE GOVERNMENT

09:09:41.148 --> 09:09:43.917
CODE SECTION AROUND THESE REALLY

09:09:43.984 --> 09:09:44.951
IMPORTANT PUBLIC SAFETY AND

09:09:45.018 --> 09:09:46.253
JUVENILE JUSTICE DUTIES AND

09:09:46.320 --> 09:09:48.689
TAKING PROBATION OUT OF THOSE

09:09:48.755 --> 09:09:49.790
SERVICES. THANK YOU. SENATOR.

09:09:49.856 --> 09:09:52.893
SENATOR, I WANT TO MAKE SURE

09:09:52.959 --> 09:09:54.294
WE'RE REALLY DRAWING THIS

09:09:54.361 --> 09:09:56.863
DISTINCTION, THAT PEACE OFFICER

09:09:56.930 --> 09:09:58.632
DUTIES AND ROLES ARE NEEDED AND

09:09:58.699 --> 09:10:00.200
WILL BE MAINTAINED IN JUVENILE

09:10:00.267 --> 09:10:02.636
HALLS. YOU HAVE TO HAVE THEM. MY

09:10:02.703 --> 09:10:04.371
BILL DOESN'T TALK ABOUT THE

09:10:04.438 --> 09:10:05.939
ROLES THAT ARE PEACE OFFICERS

09:10:06.006 --> 09:10:08.442
REQUIRED TO DO THE SAFETY, THE

09:10:08.508 --> 09:10:11.311
TRANSFER, THE CONTROL OF THE

09:10:11.378 --> 09:10:12.779
JUVENILE HALL OR THE RANCH.

09:10:12.846 --> 09:10:14.481
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SERVICES

09:10:14.548 --> 09:10:16.817
ONLY, ONLY THE SERVICES THAT ARE

09:10:16.883 --> 09:10:18.919
NOT HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN OUR

09:10:18.985 --> 09:10:20.020
JUVENILE HALLS. IN MY

09:10:20.087 --> 09:10:21.488
INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS THAT I

09:10:21.555 --> 09:10:22.823
RAN, WE BROUGHT OTHER

09:10:22.889 --> 09:10:23.857
REPRESENTATIVES FROM OTHER

09:10:23.924 --> 09:10:26.860
COUNTY WHO ARE IMMACULATE. AND

09:10:26.927 --> 09:10:28.595
WHAT THE OPPOSITION JUST SHARED

09:10:28.662 --> 09:10:30.797
IS HAPPENING IN OTHER COUNTIES.

09:10:30.864 --> 09:10:32.532
IT'S JUST NOT HAPPENING IN L.A.

09:10:32.599 --> 09:10:35.402
COUNTY. AFTER TWO YEARS WORTH OF

09:10:35.469 --> 09:10:37.971
DIGGING INTO THIS THIS TOPIC, WE

09:10:38.038 --> 09:10:39.706
LEARNED THAT OTHER PROBATION

09:10:39.773 --> 09:10:42.209
DEPARTMENTS ARE MORE OPEN DOOR

09:10:42.275 --> 09:10:44.411
POLICY TO COLLABORATE WITH OTHER

09:10:44.478 --> 09:10:46.413
CBOS. IF WE HAD THAT IN L.A.

09:10:46.480 --> 09:10:48.248
COUNTY, THIS BILL WOULD NOT BE

09:10:48.315 --> 09:10:49.483
IN EXISTENCE. WE WOULDN'T NEED

09:10:49.549 --> 09:10:50.851
TO RUN THIS BILL BECAUSE THERE

09:10:50.917 --> 09:10:52.452
WOULD BE A REALLY CLOSE

09:10:52.519 --> 09:10:54.121
COLLABORATION WITH PROBATION AND

09:10:54.187 --> 09:10:56.089
CBOS AS IT EXISTS RIGHT NOW, BUT

09:10:56.156 --> 09:10:57.758
THAT'S JUST NOT HAPPENING. SO IN

09:10:57.824 --> 09:10:59.626
ORDER FOR US TO PROVIDE THE

09:10:59.693 --> 09:11:01.061
SERVICES AND THIS BILL DOESN'T

09:11:01.128 --> 09:11:02.763
TALK ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF YEARS

09:11:02.829 --> 09:11:05.031
JUVENILE SPENDS AND WHAT CRIME

09:11:05.098 --> 09:11:06.733
THEY COMMITTED, THAT HAS NOTHING

09:11:06.800 --> 09:11:09.036
TO DO WITH THIS BILL, BECAUSE

09:11:09.102 --> 09:11:09.970
REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU

09:11:10.036 --> 09:11:12.239
COMMITTED, YOU STILL ARE OWED

09:11:12.305 --> 09:11:13.707
REHABILITATIVE SERVICES, JUST

09:11:13.774 --> 09:11:15.642
LIKE IN CDCR. AND WE TALK ABOUT

09:11:15.709 --> 09:11:17.544
OUR PRINCIPLES. CALIFORNIA IS

09:11:17.611 --> 09:11:19.379
GOING THROUGH TOWARDS A

09:11:19.446 --> 09:11:21.515
CALIFORNIA MODEL BASED OFF OF

09:11:21.581 --> 09:11:23.717
NORWAY MODEL THAT WE JUST VOTED

09:11:23.784 --> 09:11:25.886
ON INVESTMENT IN DOLLARS FOR

09:11:25.952 --> 09:11:27.888
CDCR SAN QUENTIN. AND IF WE WANT

09:11:27.954 --> 09:11:29.256
TO TALK ABOUT OUR PRINCIPLES AND

09:11:29.322 --> 09:11:30.891
WHERE CALIFORNIA IS GOING, THIS

09:11:30.957 --> 09:11:32.058
BODY JUST VOTED IN THIS BUDGET

09:11:32.125 --> 09:11:36.797
THIS YEAR, A NEW ABILITY TO

09:11:36.863 --> 09:11:38.031
ALLOW COUNTIES TO WITHHOLD

09:11:38.098 --> 09:11:40.233
FUNDING FROM HALLS THAT ARE NOT

09:11:40.300 --> 09:11:42.769
IN COMPLIANT RIGHT NOW. SO IF

09:11:42.836 --> 09:11:44.371
PROBATION DOES NOT GET ANY HELP

09:11:44.438 --> 09:11:45.906
RIGHT NOW, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

09:11:45.972 --> 09:11:47.707
GET ANY FUNDING BECAUSE WE JUST

09:11:47.774 --> 09:11:49.142
PASSED THAT IN THE BUDGET LESS

09:11:49.209 --> 09:11:50.877
THAN THREE WEEKS AGO. SO THIS IS

09:11:50.944 --> 09:11:52.179
GOING TO HELP THEM. AND I JUST

09:11:52.245 --> 09:11:53.747
WANT TO READ SOMETHING,

09:11:53.814 --> 09:11:55.348
ASSEMBLYMEMBER, THAT THEY TALK

09:11:55.415 --> 09:11:56.616
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THIS

09:11:56.683 --> 09:11:57.851
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COURTS.

09:11:57.918 --> 09:11:59.085
PERMISSION TO READ GRANTED. FOR

09:11:59.152 --> 09:12:00.887
THE RECORD, IT'S ALL GOOD. I FOR

09:12:00.954 --> 09:12:03.089
THE FLOOR. I THOUGHT THAT WAS

09:12:03.156 --> 09:12:04.991
ONLY FOR THE FLOOR. I APOLOGIZE.

09:12:05.058 --> 09:12:06.526
WE'RE VERY FORMAL HERE WITH THE

09:12:06.593 --> 09:12:08.695
COURTS. THIS JUST HAPPENED MAY

09:12:08.762 --> 09:12:11.064
9TH BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO GO TO

09:12:11.131 --> 09:12:13.366
COURT AND SO FORTH. THEY

09:12:13.433 --> 09:12:14.201
REQUESTED THIS. THIS HAPPENS ALL

09:12:14.267 --> 09:12:16.169
THE TIME. REASON FOR CONTINUANCE

09:12:16.236 --> 09:12:18.038
AT THE PROBATION. ASKED FOR

09:12:18.104 --> 09:12:19.806
REASON FOR CONTINUANCE. AT THIS

09:12:19.873 --> 09:12:21.641
TIME, PROBATION DOES NOT HAVE

09:12:21.708 --> 09:12:22.709
ADEQUATE STAFFING IN THE FIELD

09:12:22.776 --> 09:12:24.244
TO PREPARE A SUFFICIENT REPORT

09:12:24.311 --> 09:12:26.012
FOR THE COURT'S CONSIDERATION.

09:12:26.079 --> 09:12:27.481
THEREFORE, A CONTINUOUS

09:12:27.547 --> 09:12:29.015
RESPECTFULLY REQUESTED FOR ONE

09:12:29.082 --> 09:12:31.318
MONTH THAT IS HAPPENING OVER AND

09:12:31.384 --> 09:12:33.086
OVER AGAIN BY LÃ PROBATION ON

09:12:33.153 --> 09:12:33.820
THEIR BEHALF, REQUESTING IT

09:12:33.887 --> 09:12:35.021
BECAUSE THEY THEMSELVES KNOW

09:12:35.088 --> 09:12:37.224
THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH STAFF

09:12:37.290 --> 09:12:39.726
BECAUSE OF AB109. THEY JUST

09:12:39.793 --> 09:12:41.094
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH STAFF.

09:12:41.161 --> 09:12:42.195
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. SO REAL QUICK,

09:12:42.262 --> 09:12:43.363
REAL QUICK, THE CBOS THAT YOU'RE

09:12:43.430 --> 09:12:44.798
TALKING ABOUT IN THESE OTHER

09:12:44.865 --> 09:12:46.266
COUNTIES, ARE WE USING THE SAME

09:12:46.333 --> 09:12:48.034
CBOS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY? SOME

09:12:48.101 --> 09:12:49.803
ARE LIKE ARK IS STATEWIDE AND

09:12:49.870 --> 09:12:51.838
THAT'S USED ACROSS THE STATE.

09:12:51.905 --> 09:12:53.707
YES, BUT I CAN'T PINPOINT A

09:12:53.773 --> 09:12:55.141
WHOLE LIST OF OTHER CBOS. SOME

09:12:55.208 --> 09:12:57.377
ARE MORE LOCAL TO LA. OKAY,

09:12:57.444 --> 09:12:59.079
WELL, I JUST I JUST SEEM IF

09:12:59.145 --> 09:13:00.647
THOSE OTHER COUNTIES IN YOUR

09:13:00.714 --> 09:13:01.414
INFORMATIONAL HEARING ARE

09:13:01.481 --> 09:13:03.216
WORKING, I DON'T KNOW WHY WE

09:13:03.283 --> 09:13:03.850
WOULDN'T LOOK INTO THOSE CBOS

09:13:03.917 --> 09:13:05.685
AND HAVE THEM COME TO LA COUNTY

09:13:05.752 --> 09:13:08.021
IF OBVIOUSLY THOSE CHIEF

09:13:08.088 --> 09:13:10.557
PROBATION OFFICERS ARE OKAY WITH

09:13:10.624 --> 09:13:12.559
IT. SOME ARE LOCAL ASSEMBLY

09:13:12.626 --> 09:13:14.127
MEMBER THAT WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO.

09:13:14.194 --> 09:13:17.497
BUT LIKE ARK IS STATEWIDE. OKAY.

09:13:17.564 --> 09:13:19.533
WELL AGAIN, LOS ANGELES HAS A

09:13:19.599 --> 09:13:21.167
LOT OF ISSUES. I CAN GET THAT.

09:13:21.234 --> 09:13:23.570
THERE WAS A POINT THAT YOU DID

09:13:23.637 --> 09:13:25.238
MAKE. I WILL JUST NOTE WE HAVE A

09:13:25.305 --> 09:13:26.473
LOS ANGELES LEGISLATOR HERE AND

09:13:26.540 --> 09:13:28.408
AT LEAST A COUPLE ON THE DAIS.

09:13:28.475 --> 09:13:30.277
YEAH, YEAH, A FEW OF THEM. YOU

09:13:30.343 --> 09:13:31.845
GUYS NEED TO HAVE A TALK WITH

09:13:31.912 --> 09:13:33.313
THOSE LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS TO

09:13:33.380 --> 09:13:36.516
MAKE SURE THEY DO THEIR JOBS.

09:13:36.583 --> 09:13:38.318
YOU MADE A POINT ABOUT PROBATION

09:13:38.385 --> 09:13:39.286
OFFICERS BEING PULLED OFF THE

09:13:39.352 --> 09:13:40.587
STREETS AND BEING BROUGHT INTO

09:13:40.654 --> 09:13:43.723
THE HALL. YOU KNOW, I, I SEE

09:13:43.790 --> 09:13:45.926
THAT ISSUE, ACTUALLY, I TRIED

09:13:45.992 --> 09:13:47.360
FIXING THAT ISSUE WITH, WITH

09:13:47.427 --> 09:13:48.728
JURY DUTY, TRYING TO KEEP THEM

09:13:48.795 --> 09:13:51.031
OUT ON THE STREETS AS WELL. BUT

09:13:51.097 --> 09:13:52.332
WE'RE WORKING ON THAT SIDE NOTE,

09:13:52.399 --> 09:13:54.935
I SO I SEE THE VALUE. I SEE THE

09:13:55.001 --> 09:13:56.036
VALUE IN REHABILITATION. WE TALK

09:13:56.102 --> 09:13:57.771
ABOUT IT HERE ALL THE TIME HERE

09:13:57.837 --> 09:13:59.606
IN COMMITTEE. BUT BUT TO YOUR

09:13:59.673 --> 09:14:01.241
POINT ALSO ABOUT BRINGING THOSE

09:14:01.308 --> 09:14:01.808
THAT HAVE BEEN INCARCERATED,

09:14:01.875 --> 09:14:03.610
I'VE ALSO SEEN IN THIS COMMITTEE

09:14:03.677 --> 09:14:05.779
WHERE WE CUT SENTENCES SHORT, WE

09:14:05.845 --> 09:14:06.379
DON'T GIVE THEM THE TIME TO

09:14:06.446 --> 09:14:07.080
REHABILITATE. AND SO THEN BY

09:14:07.147 --> 09:14:08.348
THEN WE'RE CREATING OUR OWN

09:14:08.415 --> 09:14:10.951
STORM, OUR OWN ISSUE BY NOW,

09:14:11.017 --> 09:14:11.585
ALLOWING THEM TO GO INTO THESE

09:14:11.651 --> 09:14:12.953
FACILITIES, THEY CAN GET

09:14:13.019 --> 09:14:14.721
EXPUNGED AFTER SO MANY YEARS. OR

09:14:14.788 --> 09:14:15.622
AGAIN, THEY DON'T FINISH THEIR

09:14:15.689 --> 09:14:17.157
TIME. THEY DON'T FINISH THEIR

09:14:17.223 --> 09:14:18.058
THEIR CLASSES. BUT YET WE'RE

09:14:18.124 --> 09:14:19.192
GOING TO GIVE THEM A PASS. AND

09:14:19.259 --> 09:14:21.027
BY THAT PASS NOW WE'RE GOING TO

09:14:21.094 --> 09:14:23.663
ALLOW THEM TO COME IN HERE WITH

09:14:23.730 --> 09:14:25.298
OUR CHILDREN THAT ARE TRYING TO

09:14:25.365 --> 09:14:26.566
GET REHABILITATED IN THE

09:14:26.633 --> 09:14:27.167
JUVENILE HALLS, THAT PROBATION

09:14:27.233 --> 09:14:28.301
IS IN CHARGE OF OR CHARGED WITH

09:14:28.368 --> 09:14:29.836
MAKING SURE THEY TAKE CARE OF

09:14:29.903 --> 09:14:33.173
THAT. AND SO I JUST I JUST SEE,

09:14:33.239 --> 09:14:34.040
I DO SEE THE ISSUES THAT WERE

09:14:34.107 --> 09:14:35.475
BROUGHT UP BY MY, MY COLLEAGUES

09:14:35.542 --> 09:14:38.778
UP HERE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF

09:14:38.845 --> 09:14:39.813
DISCUSSIONS. I THINK EVERYBODY

09:14:39.879 --> 09:14:42.882
HERE IN OPPOSITION BEING A BIG

09:14:42.949 --> 09:14:44.551
PART OF THAT. THE POINTS THAT

09:14:44.618 --> 09:14:45.885
WERE MADE TODAY, I, I

09:14:45.952 --> 09:14:47.854
WHOLEHEARTEDLY BELIEVE THAT

09:14:47.921 --> 09:14:48.989
PROBATION IS DOING THEIR BEST.

09:14:49.055 --> 09:14:50.156
ALL THE PROBATION OFFICERS THAT

09:14:50.223 --> 09:14:52.926
I KNOW, THEY'RE NOT IN IT FOR

09:14:52.993 --> 09:14:54.427
THE MONEY. THEY UNDERSTAND THEY

09:14:54.494 --> 09:14:55.729
NEED A DEGREE TO GET WHERE THEY

09:14:55.795 --> 09:14:57.564
ARE, BECAUSE THEY LOVE TAKING

09:14:57.631 --> 09:14:59.032
CARE OF PEOPLE AND HELPING

09:14:59.099 --> 09:14:59.966
PEOPLE. I DON'T KNOW SO MUCH

09:15:00.033 --> 09:15:01.101
ABOUT THESE THESE OTHER

09:15:01.167 --> 09:15:03.003
ENTITIES, BUT WHEN A PROBATION

09:15:03.069 --> 09:15:04.638
OFFICER IS GIVEN THAT BADGE OR

09:15:04.704 --> 09:15:06.106
EARNED THAT BADGE AND TAKES THAT

09:15:06.172 --> 09:15:07.674
OATH, I BELIEVE THEY'RE GOING TO

09:15:07.741 --> 09:15:10.543
DO WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO. I

09:15:10.610 --> 09:15:13.013
HAVE ONE OTHER THING. I KNOW THE

09:15:13.079 --> 09:15:14.381
CHAIR HAD MENTIONED THAT WE'RE

09:15:14.447 --> 09:15:16.583
GOING TO BE HOLDING THIS IN

09:15:16.650 --> 09:15:18.752
COMMITTEE OR HOLDING THIS NÃ.

09:15:18.818 --> 09:15:20.120
THE AGREEMENT THAT WAS JUST

09:15:20.186 --> 09:15:21.521
STATED ON THE RECORD EARLIER IS

09:15:21.588 --> 09:15:23.590
THAT SHOULD THE BILL PASS OUT OF

09:15:23.657 --> 09:15:24.557
COMMITTEE, SENATOR MENGIBAR HAS

09:15:24.624 --> 09:15:26.359
AGREED TO HOLD IT AND NOT

09:15:26.426 --> 09:15:27.661
PROCEED WITH THE FLOOR VOTE.

09:15:27.727 --> 09:15:30.296
THIS CALENDAR YEAR? IS THERE, IS

09:15:30.363 --> 09:15:32.098
THERE? SO I'M ASSUMING THERE'S

09:15:32.165 --> 09:15:35.301
NOT AN URGENCY ON THIS THEN? NO,

09:15:35.368 --> 09:15:38.271
THERE'S NO URGENCY PROVISION.

09:15:38.338 --> 09:15:39.773
SENATOR, IT'S YOUR BILL. YOU GO

09:15:39.839 --> 09:15:41.341
RIGHT AHEAD. THERE IS DEFINITELY

09:15:41.408 --> 09:15:42.609
AN URGENCY IN L.A. COUNTY, BUT

09:15:42.676 --> 09:15:44.144
THIS WAS THE ONLY WAY THAT I

09:15:44.210 --> 09:15:46.179
COULD GET IT OUT OF POLICY

09:15:46.246 --> 09:15:47.681
COMMITTEE. SO I THAT WAS THE

09:15:47.747 --> 09:15:49.015
ONLY WAY I COULD GET IT TO THE

09:15:49.082 --> 09:15:50.817
FLOOR. BUT FROM WHAT I

09:15:50.884 --> 09:15:52.218
UNDERSTAND, WHEN IT GETS TO THE

09:15:52.285 --> 09:15:53.953
FLOOR, WE DON'T HAVE ANY MORE

09:15:54.020 --> 09:15:54.954
ARGUMENTS TO MAKE UNLESS IT'S

09:15:55.021 --> 09:15:56.623
AMONGST OURSELVES ON THE FLOOR.

09:15:56.690 --> 09:15:57.891
IS THERE IS THERE MAYBE AN

09:15:57.957 --> 09:15:59.159
AVENUE WHERE WE CAN BRING IT

09:15:59.225 --> 09:16:01.327
BACK HERE AND MAYBE WORK WITH

09:16:01.394 --> 09:16:02.128
OPPOSITION? IT WOULD BE UP TO

09:16:02.195 --> 09:16:04.564
THE CHAIR TO DO THAT. OKAY. BUT

09:16:04.631 --> 09:16:06.066
I'M HOPING THAT THE DEAL THAT

09:16:06.132 --> 09:16:08.134
WAS CUT IS THE DEAL ON THE TABLE

09:16:08.201 --> 09:16:09.135
RIGHT NOW. AND I WOULD JUST

09:16:09.202 --> 09:16:11.604
NOTE, MR. VICE CHAIR, AS YOU'RE

09:16:11.671 --> 09:16:12.706
PROBABLY WELL AWARE, IF THERE

09:16:12.772 --> 09:16:13.339
WERE SIGNIFICANT AND SUBSTANTIAL

09:16:13.406 --> 09:16:14.174
POLICY CHANGES, THE COMMITTEE

09:16:14.240 --> 09:16:16.176
WOULD HAVE THE PURVIEW TO BRING

09:16:16.242 --> 09:16:17.811
THAT BACK IN. IF THERE WERE

09:16:17.877 --> 09:16:19.813
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES. AND I DO

09:16:19.879 --> 09:16:21.448
TRUST OUR COMMITTEE AND THE

09:16:21.514 --> 09:16:24.951
CHAIR. YES. THANK THE OPPOSITION

09:16:25.018 --> 09:16:26.252
FOR COMING IN. AND THANK YOU,

09:16:26.319 --> 09:16:28.521
SENATOR. VERY GOOD.

09:16:28.588 --> 09:16:29.456
ASSEMBLYMEMBER NGUYEN, YOU HAVE

09:16:29.522 --> 09:16:30.857
BEEN PATIENT. I JUST HAVE A

09:16:30.924 --> 09:16:32.926
QUICK QUESTION OR A COMMENT AND

09:16:32.992 --> 09:16:34.794
EITHER SIDE CAN ANSWER THE

09:16:34.861 --> 09:16:35.495
QUESTION, BUT I HEARD A LOT

09:16:35.562 --> 09:16:37.063
ABOUT NOT ENOUGH STAFFING. I

09:16:37.130 --> 09:16:39.432
HEARD A LOT ABOUT HAVING

09:16:39.499 --> 09:16:40.767
INCENTIVES, BUT NOT GETTING

09:16:40.834 --> 09:16:42.736
FOLKS TO BE ABLE TO APPLY. I'M

09:16:42.802 --> 09:16:44.571
WONDERING THOUGH, THE WHOLE NOT

09:16:44.637 --> 09:16:46.306
ENOUGH STAFFING TO DO WORK HAS

09:16:46.372 --> 09:16:48.041
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE. I READ

09:16:48.108 --> 09:16:49.876
IT SOMEWHERE THAT LA COUNTY PUT

09:16:49.943 --> 09:16:51.478
A FREEZE ON HIRING OF PROBATION

09:16:51.544 --> 09:16:52.812
OFFICERS FOR TEN YEARS. ARE WE

09:16:52.879 --> 09:16:54.881
JUST NOW PLAYING CATCH UP? AND

09:16:54.948 --> 09:16:56.750
THAT'S WHY WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

09:16:56.816 --> 09:16:57.784
STAFFING FOR THIS. AND EITHER

09:16:57.851 --> 09:16:59.085
SIDE CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

09:16:59.152 --> 09:17:00.553
I'LL SPEAK TO IT. SINCE I'VE

09:17:00.620 --> 09:17:02.055
BEEN IN THE DEPARTMENT FOR 33

09:17:02.122 --> 09:17:05.725
YEARS. FOR YEARS THERE WAS A

09:17:05.792 --> 09:17:07.193
HIRING FREEZE ALLOCATED BY THE

09:17:07.260 --> 09:17:09.529
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS, AND IF YOU

09:17:09.596 --> 09:17:12.265
GO BACK TO I WANT TO CARRY YOU

09:17:12.332 --> 09:17:14.467
TOO FAR BACK, BUT IF YOU GO BACK

09:17:14.534 --> 09:17:16.503
TO 2011, LOS ANGELES COUNTY USED

09:17:16.569 --> 09:17:19.439
TO HAVE 19 CAMPS. WE'RE DOWN TO

09:17:19.506 --> 09:17:21.574
FOUR CAMPS NOW. AND WHEN THEY

09:17:21.641 --> 09:17:24.677
DID THAT, THEY DECIDED TO NOT

09:17:24.744 --> 09:17:26.212
KEEP UP WITH ATTRITION, EVEN

09:17:26.279 --> 09:17:28.314
THOUGH WE KNEW THERE WOULD BE A

09:17:28.381 --> 09:17:30.450
REDUCTION IN INVENTORY OF STAFF.

09:17:30.517 --> 09:17:32.919
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH

09:17:32.986 --> 09:17:35.555
HIRING ALLOWED TO KEEP UP WITH

09:17:35.622 --> 09:17:36.656
ATTRITION. FOR INSTANCE, I, I

09:17:36.723 --> 09:17:38.792
REPRESENT THE RANK AND FILE. 15

09:17:38.858 --> 09:17:40.960
YEARS AGO, THERE WERE 4400

09:17:41.027 --> 09:17:43.530
MEMBERS IN THE RANK AND FILE.

09:17:43.596 --> 09:17:45.598
TODAY IT'S LESS THAN 2100

09:17:45.665 --> 09:17:47.433
MEMBERS. AND SOMETIME WHEN YOU

09:17:47.500 --> 09:17:50.336
HEAR THAT SERVICE IS NOT BEING

09:17:50.403 --> 09:17:51.738
PROVIDED, WE COULD BLAME THOSE

09:17:51.805 --> 09:17:54.774
WHO SYSTEMATICALLY CHANGE THE

09:17:54.841 --> 09:17:56.743
IDEOLOGY AND THE HIRING

09:17:56.810 --> 09:17:58.578
PRACTICES FOR LA COUNTY. AND

09:17:58.645 --> 09:18:00.113
THEN YOU GET TO THE POINT WHERE

09:18:00.180 --> 09:18:02.549
THEY'RE STARTING TO REFORM THEIR

09:18:02.615 --> 09:18:06.386
MENTALITY ABOUT HIRING. YOU HAVE

09:18:06.452 --> 09:18:09.355
PLACED A DISPARAGING VIEW OF

09:18:09.422 --> 09:18:12.292
PROBATION SO BAD THAT ALL LAW

09:18:12.358 --> 09:18:13.393
ENFORCEMENT IN LOS ANGELES

09:18:13.459 --> 09:18:16.496
COUNTY HAS A STAFFING PROBLEM.

09:18:16.563 --> 09:18:18.832
THE SHERIFFS ARE DOWN 1500. WE

09:18:18.898 --> 09:18:20.934
ARE DOWN A THOUSAND OFFICERS.

09:18:21.000 --> 09:18:23.102
LAPD IS OFFERING $75,000

09:18:23.169 --> 09:18:24.904
BONUSES. IT IS A PROBLEM

09:18:24.971 --> 09:18:26.372
THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND

09:18:26.439 --> 09:18:27.774
ESPECIALLY IN LOS ANGELES

09:18:27.841 --> 09:18:29.909
COUNTY. SO SOME THINGS ARE

09:18:29.976 --> 09:18:31.411
EXPERIENCED BY THE SYSTEMATIC

09:18:31.477 --> 09:18:33.913
APPROACH THAT WAS GIVEN TO THE

09:18:33.980 --> 09:18:36.015
DEPARTMENT. AND AGAIN, I'LL SAY

09:18:36.082 --> 09:18:38.218
THE PEACE OFFICERS THEMSELVES,

09:18:38.284 --> 09:18:39.686
THROUGH THEIR COLLECTIVE

09:18:39.752 --> 09:18:40.753
BARGAINING AGREEMENT, THEIR

09:18:40.820 --> 09:18:42.121
UNION THEY REPRESENT, HAS COME

09:18:42.188 --> 09:18:46.025
TO THE STATE TO TRY TO GET THEM

09:18:46.092 --> 09:18:48.494
TO ENCOURAGE LOS ANGELES COUNTY,

09:18:48.561 --> 09:18:51.064
DEAL WITH THE STAFFING SHORTAGE,

09:18:51.130 --> 09:18:53.600
DEAL WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE

09:18:53.666 --> 09:18:55.168
PROBLEM. FOR INSTANCE, WHEN THE

09:18:55.235 --> 09:18:57.704
STATE DECIDED TO TURN OVER

09:18:57.770 --> 09:19:00.206
DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE

09:19:00.273 --> 09:19:03.509
TO THE COUNTIES LA COUNTY IN TWO

09:19:03.576 --> 09:19:05.411
AND A HALF YEARS RECEIVED 88

09:19:05.478 --> 09:19:07.013
MILLION. THERE WAS A STATE AUDIT

09:19:07.080 --> 09:19:08.581
DONE LAST YEAR IN AUGUST, THEY

09:19:08.648 --> 09:19:11.084
ONLY SPENT 9 MILLION SO FAR. SO

09:19:11.150 --> 09:19:13.219
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OTHER 79

09:19:13.286 --> 09:19:14.254
MILLION? ARE YOU WITHHOLDING

09:19:14.320 --> 09:19:16.322
THAT OR ARE YOU ACTUALLY USING

09:19:16.389 --> 09:19:18.091
THAT TO INVEST IN THE

09:19:18.157 --> 09:19:19.993
DEPARTMENT? THEY'RE HOLDING IT

09:19:20.059 --> 09:19:23.630
FOR OTHER FUNDING. SO YES, WE

09:19:23.696 --> 09:19:25.465
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH STAFFING.

09:19:25.531 --> 09:19:27.934
WE'RE TRYING TO CURE THAT. THIS

09:19:28.001 --> 09:19:30.169
RANK AND FILE MET WITH THE CHIEF

09:19:30.236 --> 09:19:31.104
YESTERDAY TO TRY TO CONVINCE HIM

09:19:31.170 --> 09:19:33.172
THAT HE'S STILL BEING

09:19:33.239 --> 09:19:35.475
HANDCUFFED. THERE'S NO REASON

09:19:35.541 --> 09:19:38.011
THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE ACADEMY OF

09:19:38.077 --> 09:19:39.612
EIGHT PEOPLE IN YOUR RECRUITMENT

09:19:39.679 --> 09:19:40.780
WHEN YOU HAVE APPLICATIONS OF

09:19:40.847 --> 09:19:43.716
OVER 500, SO THERE'S SOMETHING

09:19:43.783 --> 09:19:45.685
WRONG WITH THE PROCESS THAT

09:19:45.752 --> 09:19:48.054
COULD ASSIST US IN STARTING THE

09:19:48.121 --> 09:19:51.624
REFORMS THAT WE NEED. MAY I

09:19:51.691 --> 09:19:53.259
RESPOND, ASSEMBLYMEMBER, THROUGH

09:19:53.326 --> 09:19:57.130
THE CHAIR. IT COULD BE A

09:19:57.196 --> 09:19:58.097
COMBINATION OF THAT

09:19:58.164 --> 09:19:59.565
ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S SURE OF A

09:19:59.632 --> 09:20:01.401
FREEZE AND SO FORTH. BUT THE

09:20:01.467 --> 09:20:02.769
PROBLEMS IN L.A. COUNTY

09:20:02.835 --> 09:20:05.305
PROBATION GO AS FAR BACK AS

09:20:05.371 --> 09:20:08.641
2006. THAT IS 19 YEARS. 2006 IS

09:20:08.708 --> 09:20:11.444
WHEN THE DOJ PUT THEM UNDER

09:20:11.511 --> 09:20:13.079
FEDERAL SUPERVISION FOR REPORTS

09:20:13.146 --> 09:20:16.115
OF ABUSE. 2008 L.A. COUNTY WAS

09:20:16.182 --> 09:20:17.483
FOUND VIOLATING CONSTITUTIONAL

09:20:17.550 --> 09:20:19.352
RIGHTS OF JUVENILE DETAINEES,

09:20:19.419 --> 09:20:22.355
2002 LAWSUITS. THEY JUST ARE

09:20:22.422 --> 09:20:25.058
ABOUT TO SETTLE ON A $4 BILLION

09:20:25.124 --> 09:20:27.593
LAWSUIT FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT. I

09:20:27.660 --> 09:20:29.462
GET IT. THERE ARE GOOD APPLES

09:20:29.529 --> 09:20:31.597
EVERYWHERE. I GET IT THAT OTHER

09:20:31.664 --> 09:20:32.532
PROBATION DEPARTMENTS ARE DOING

09:20:32.598 --> 09:20:34.534
WELL, BUT IN IN LA PROBATION

09:20:34.600 --> 09:20:35.635
THERE'S GOING ON EVEN THOUGH

09:20:35.702 --> 09:20:37.804
WITH THE INABILITY TO HIRE, WE

09:20:37.870 --> 09:20:39.906
STILL HAVE A 60% CALL OUT DAY

09:20:39.973 --> 09:20:42.041
CALL OUT ON ANY GIVEN DAY. SO

09:20:42.108 --> 09:20:43.776
EVEN THE PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE

09:20:43.843 --> 09:20:45.178
HIRED NOW, EVEN THOUGH IT'S

09:20:45.244 --> 09:20:47.013
LOWER STAFF, THEY ARE NOT EVEN

09:20:47.080 --> 09:20:48.915
SHOWING UP. SO REGARDLESS, IF WE

09:20:48.982 --> 09:20:50.650
HIRE MORE PEOPLE, THE CALL OUT

09:20:50.717 --> 09:20:53.619
CULTURE IS STILL VERY, VERY REAL

09:20:53.686 --> 09:20:56.756
IN LA COUNTY. SO IN TERMS OF THE

09:20:56.823 --> 09:20:58.925
FUNDING, WE AS THE STATE ARE

09:20:58.992 --> 09:21:00.293
REQUIRED BY LAW TO SEND DOWN

09:21:00.360 --> 09:21:01.961
FUNDING TO EVERY COUNTY AND IT

09:21:02.028 --> 09:21:04.397
IS APPROXIMATELY $88 MILLION.

09:21:04.464 --> 09:21:06.432
BUT THERE IS A COUNCIL, IT'S BY

09:21:06.499 --> 09:21:08.401
LAW THAT EXISTS ON EVERY IN

09:21:08.468 --> 09:21:10.470
EVERY SINGLE COUNTY IS THE JJ

09:21:10.536 --> 09:21:11.904
LEAGUE COUNCIL THAT EXISTS IN

09:21:11.971 --> 09:21:13.473
EVERY COUNTY THAT DETERMINES HOW

09:21:13.539 --> 09:21:15.208
THAT FUNDING IS SPENT. DO YOU

09:21:15.274 --> 09:21:17.176
KNOW WHO IS THE HEAD OF THAT

09:21:17.243 --> 09:21:18.411
COUNCIL? THE CHIEF PROBATION

09:21:18.478 --> 09:21:19.812
OFFICER? THE CHIEF PROBATION

09:21:19.879 --> 09:21:21.314
OFFICER DETERMINES HOW THAT

09:21:21.381 --> 09:21:24.484
FUNDING IS SPENT. SO IT'S NOT ON

09:21:24.550 --> 09:21:26.452
ANYONE ELSE BUT THE CHIEF

09:21:26.519 --> 09:21:27.086
PROBATION OFFICER TO DETERMINE

09:21:27.153 --> 09:21:28.955
HOW THAT FUNDING IS SPENT. AND

09:21:29.022 --> 09:21:31.858
THEY SAT ON CLOSE TO $80

09:21:31.924 --> 09:21:33.860
MILLION. SO I WE KEEP POINTING

09:21:33.926 --> 09:21:35.661
FINGERS HERE AND THERE, HERE AND

09:21:35.728 --> 09:21:37.096
THERE. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS

09:21:37.163 --> 09:21:38.865
KIDS ARE DYING. THE BOTTOM LINE

09:21:38.931 --> 09:21:41.167
IS 30 OFFICERS WERE INDICTED FOR

09:21:41.234 --> 09:21:43.202
RUNNING A GLADIATOR FIGHT. ONE

09:21:43.269 --> 09:21:44.237
OFFICER JUST ARRESTED A COUPLE

09:21:44.303 --> 09:21:46.472
WEEKS AGO FOR BRINGING IN DRUGS

09:21:46.539 --> 09:21:50.043
AT 12. $7 MILLION LAWSUIT OR

09:21:50.109 --> 09:21:51.144
SETTLEMENT FOR THE TEAM THAT GOT

09:21:51.210 --> 09:21:53.279
BEAT UP, $4 MILLION FOR LAWSUITS

09:21:53.346 --> 09:21:54.313
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT BECAUSE THEY

09:21:54.380 --> 09:21:55.915
WERE RAPING OTHER WOMEN AND BOYS

09:21:55.982 --> 09:21:58.017
IN THERE, THE GIRLS AND BOYS IN

09:21:58.084 --> 09:22:00.620
THERE. SO I RESPECTFULLY AM

09:22:00.686 --> 09:22:02.422
TIRED OF EXCUSES. AND I'VE HAD

09:22:02.488 --> 09:22:04.457
THREE YEARS CONVERSATIONS WITH

09:22:04.524 --> 09:22:05.825
PROBATION AND NO AMENDMENT HAS

09:22:05.892 --> 09:22:08.161
BEEN PROPOSED TO ME. WE ARE ALL

09:22:08.227 --> 09:22:09.595
LEGISLATORS HERE. YOU KNOW HOW

09:22:09.662 --> 09:22:11.431
HARD IT IS TO GET THESE BILLS

09:22:11.497 --> 09:22:13.132
THROUGH. AND IF WE DON'T GET

09:22:13.199 --> 09:22:13.866
AMENDMENTS FOR OPPOSITION, HOW

09:22:13.933 --> 09:22:15.168
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO WORK ON THAT?

09:22:15.234 --> 09:22:17.236
ALL THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE

09:22:17.303 --> 09:22:18.037
BEEN TAKEN SO FAR HAVE BEEN BY

09:22:18.104 --> 09:22:20.106
MY COLLEAGUES AND BY THE

09:22:20.173 --> 09:22:21.474
COMMITTEE, BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO

09:22:21.541 --> 09:22:22.975
WORK IN GOOD FAITH TO FIX THE

09:22:23.042 --> 09:22:25.244
SITUATION IN MY COUNTY, BECAUSE

09:22:25.311 --> 09:22:25.878
WHILE THIS IS GOING TO BE A TWO

09:22:25.945 --> 09:22:27.613
YEAR BILL, ANOTHER KID COULD DIE

09:22:27.680 --> 09:22:29.715
IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS. OKAY,

09:22:29.782 --> 09:22:30.349
THAT'S LITERALLY THE REALITY IN

09:22:30.416 --> 09:22:31.918
LA COUNTY. KIDS ARE LITERALLY

09:22:31.984 --> 09:22:35.621
DYING IN OVERDOSING. SO I DON'T

09:22:35.688 --> 09:22:37.690
WANT TO SIT AROUND ANYMORE TO

09:22:37.757 --> 09:22:39.092
POINT THIS, THIS AND THAT. THIS

09:22:39.158 --> 09:22:40.359
IS THE ONLY SOLUTION ON THE

09:22:40.426 --> 09:22:42.361
TABLE RIGHT NOW. PROPOSE ME

09:22:42.428 --> 09:22:44.197
ANOTHER SOLUTION. AND WE'RE WORK

09:22:44.263 --> 09:22:45.531
ON IT. BUT I HAVE NOTHING ELSE

09:22:45.598 --> 09:22:47.433
TO WORK WITH, AND WE NEED TO

09:22:47.500 --> 09:22:49.302
MOVE FORWARD IN BRINGING SOME

09:22:49.368 --> 09:22:55.074
SUPPORT. FOR YOU. YES. JUST TO

09:22:55.141 --> 09:22:57.877
GO TO THE YOU WOULD WE WOULD GET

09:22:57.944 --> 09:22:59.946
IF IT MAKES IT OUT OF THE

09:23:00.012 --> 09:23:01.314
COMMITTEE IT WOULD GO TO THE

09:23:01.380 --> 09:23:02.982
FLOOR. BUT WE'RE NOT VOTING ON

09:23:03.049 --> 09:23:05.818
IT THIS YEAR BECAUSE IT IS GOING

09:23:05.885 --> 09:23:07.253
TO BE A TWO YEAR BILL. IS THAT

09:23:07.320 --> 09:23:08.254
CORRECT? CORRECT. SO THE WAY

09:23:08.321 --> 09:23:09.021
THAT IT WILL WORK PROCEDURALLY

09:23:09.088 --> 09:23:10.056
IS THAT SENATOR MENGIBAR, AFTER

09:23:10.123 --> 09:23:11.824
IT ADVANCES OUT OF COMMITTEE, I

09:23:11.891 --> 09:23:13.326
DON'T BELIEVE IT'S KIÂ¾M FISCAL.

09:23:13.392 --> 09:23:14.093
SOMEONE CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M

09:23:14.160 --> 09:23:15.928
WRONG. SO IT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE

09:23:15.995 --> 09:23:18.131
FOR THE FLOOR. WHAT SHE WILL DO

09:23:18.197 --> 09:23:19.665
INSTEAD IS PUT IT IN THE

09:23:19.732 --> 09:23:21.567
INACTIVE FILE SO IT WOULD NOT GO

09:23:21.634 --> 09:23:23.603
UP FOR A VOTE IN THE YEAR 2025.

09:23:23.669 --> 09:23:24.203
THAT'S THE AGREEMENT THAT HAS

09:23:24.270 --> 09:23:25.838
THAT HAS BEEN STRUCK. IF THERE

09:23:25.905 --> 09:23:27.340
WERE A SIGNIFICANT POLICY

09:23:27.406 --> 09:23:29.442
CHANGE, WHETHER SHE MET WITH THE

09:23:29.509 --> 09:23:30.743
OPPOSITION AND WANTED TO

09:23:30.810 --> 09:23:31.911
DRASTICALLY REDO THE BILL, OR

09:23:31.978 --> 09:23:33.412
WHETHER LA COUNTY JUST FELT IT

09:23:33.479 --> 09:23:34.547
WAS UNWORKABLE AND WANTED TO

09:23:34.614 --> 09:23:35.748
SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE BILL,

09:23:35.815 --> 09:23:37.683
THE COMMITTEE WOULD HAVE THE

09:23:37.750 --> 09:23:39.118
AUTHORITY TO ROPE THAT BILL BACK

09:23:39.185 --> 09:23:40.353
IN, BECAUSE IT'S SUBSTANTIALLY

09:23:40.419 --> 09:23:41.687
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WAS PASSED

09:23:41.754 --> 09:23:44.190
OUT. BUT AS IT WOULD SIT AFTER

09:23:44.257 --> 09:23:45.825
COMMITTEE, IT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE

09:23:45.892 --> 09:23:47.059
FOR A FLOOR VOTE NEXT YEAR. AND

09:23:47.126 --> 09:23:48.728
I WILL NOTE THAT THE SPEAKER'S

09:23:48.794 --> 09:23:50.029
OFFICE IS AWARE OF THIS

09:23:50.096 --> 09:23:51.063
AGREEMENT AND WILL BE TRACKING

09:23:51.130 --> 09:23:52.231
IT. AND THAT IS THE

09:23:52.298 --> 09:23:53.966
UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE WILL BE

09:23:54.033 --> 09:23:55.768
NO VOTE ON THIS ON THE FLOOR IN

09:23:55.835 --> 09:23:57.603
2025. AND WHAT IS THE REASON WHY

09:23:57.670 --> 09:23:59.105
WE CAN'T SEND IT BACK SO THAT

09:23:59.172 --> 09:24:00.806
OPPOSITION CAN WORK WITH HER ON

09:24:00.873 --> 09:24:02.842
THIS AND THEN BRING IT BACK NEXT

09:24:02.909 --> 09:24:04.877
YEAR? ARE YOU REFERRING TO

09:24:04.944 --> 09:24:07.613
HOLDING IT IN COMMITTEE AS A TWO

09:24:07.680 --> 09:24:08.281
YEAR BILL? RIGHT. SORRY, BEFORE

09:24:08.347 --> 09:24:09.849
I ANSWER, IS THAT OKAY? I DON'T

09:24:09.916 --> 09:24:11.484
WANT TO SPEAK FOR SENATOR

09:24:11.551 --> 09:24:12.685
MENGIBAR, SO I WILL GIVE MY

09:24:12.752 --> 09:24:14.854
PERSPECTIVE. I THINK AS THE

09:24:14.921 --> 09:24:15.988
AUTHOR, IT'S ONLY FAIR THAT SHE

09:24:16.055 --> 09:24:17.723
ANSWER IN HER OWN WORDS, BUT I

09:24:17.790 --> 09:24:19.091
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE'S

09:24:19.158 --> 09:24:21.327
A BIT OF CONCERN THAT IF IT'S

09:24:21.394 --> 09:24:22.161
HELD IN COMMITTEE, WE'LL BE

09:24:22.228 --> 09:24:23.863
RIGHT BACK HERE NEXT YEAR. IT

09:24:23.930 --> 09:24:25.364
DOES NOT, AS THE CHAIR OF THIS

09:24:25.431 --> 09:24:27.333
COMMITTEE AND HAVING SPOKEN WITH

09:24:27.400 --> 09:24:28.935
ALL SIDES, IT DOESN'T SEEM A LOT

09:24:29.001 --> 09:24:31.237
OF YOU ARE TALKING AT ME AND

09:24:31.304 --> 09:24:31.904
WITH MY STAFF, AND I DON'T SEE A

09:24:31.971 --> 09:24:33.973
LOT OF SPEAKING WITH EACH OTHER.

09:24:34.040 --> 09:24:35.942
I THINK THAT MOVING THE BILL OUT

09:24:36.008 --> 09:24:36.976
OF COMMITTEE AND AT LEAST

09:24:37.043 --> 09:24:39.045
POISING IT FOR A FLOOR VOTE NEXT

09:24:39.111 --> 09:24:39.679
YEAR FORCES THAT CONVERSATION.

09:24:39.745 --> 09:24:41.080
IT FORCES FOLKS TO GET SERIOUS

09:24:41.147 --> 09:24:42.114
AND COME TO THE TABLE AND

09:24:42.181 --> 09:24:43.883
ACTUALLY HAVE A CONVERSATION.

09:24:43.950 --> 09:24:45.551
I'LL ADD ONE MORE THING. IF LA

09:24:45.618 --> 09:24:46.986
COUNTY FEELS THAT THE BILL IS

09:24:47.053 --> 09:24:48.421
AMENDED IS UNWORKABLE, IT GIVES

09:24:48.487 --> 09:24:49.755
YOU SIX MONTHS TO DEMONSTRATE TO

09:24:49.822 --> 09:24:51.691
ME AND TO THE COMMITTEE THAT THE

09:24:51.757 --> 09:24:52.725
AMENDMENTS ARE UNWORKABLE TO

09:24:52.792 --> 09:24:54.293
PROBATION. IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE

09:24:54.360 --> 09:24:55.661
A BETTER SOLUTION OR YOU CAN

09:24:55.728 --> 09:24:57.530
CORRECT THE DEFICIENCIES, IT

09:24:57.597 --> 09:24:58.064
GIVES YOU SIX MONTHS TO

09:24:58.130 --> 09:24:59.498
DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS BILL IS

09:24:59.565 --> 09:25:01.300
UNNECESSARY, BUT IT IMPOSES SOME

09:25:01.367 --> 09:25:02.435
SORT OF TIME FRAME TO REVISIT

09:25:02.501 --> 09:25:04.537
THE CONVERSATION. RATHER THIS IN

09:25:04.604 --> 09:25:06.005
RATHER THAN THIS INDEFINITE

09:25:06.072 --> 09:25:07.406
CYCLE THAT WE SEEM TO HAVE BEEN

09:25:07.473 --> 09:25:09.041
IN, OF TALKING AT EACH OTHER,

09:25:09.108 --> 09:25:10.309
NOT WITH EACH OTHER, AND DOING

09:25:10.376 --> 09:25:12.078
NOTHING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM,

09:25:12.144 --> 09:25:13.212
WHICH IS PROBABLY THE ONLY POINT

09:25:13.279 --> 09:25:14.947
OF COMMON GROUND THAT I GET IN

09:25:15.014 --> 09:25:16.983
THE ROOM. AS WE ALL AGREE,

09:25:17.049 --> 09:25:19.151
THERE'S A PROBLEM, AND IT SHOULD

09:25:19.218 --> 09:25:19.819
PROBABLY BE ADDRESSED WITH THAT.

09:25:19.885 --> 09:25:21.087
SENATOR MENGIBAR, YOU ARE THE

09:25:21.153 --> 09:25:22.188
AUTHOR. IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING IN

09:25:22.255 --> 09:25:23.689
YOUR OWN WORDS TO ADD, PLEASE

09:25:23.756 --> 09:25:25.925
DO. I'LL LEAVE IT AT WHAT YOU

09:25:25.992 --> 09:25:28.394
ACTUALLY KNOW. I'LL LEAVE IT AT

09:25:28.461 --> 09:25:32.932
WHAT YOU SAID. I'M SORRY, I

09:25:32.999 --> 09:25:34.800
JUST. IT'S OKAY. I'M GOOD. YEAH.

09:25:34.867 --> 09:25:36.569
DID SHE ASK A QUESTION? I WAS

09:25:36.636 --> 09:25:38.638
JUST, I WAS I'M GOING TO GO OVER

09:25:38.704 --> 09:25:40.539
WHAT YOU WERE SAYING. SO IF WE I

09:25:40.606 --> 09:25:42.041
MEAN, I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD HOLD

09:25:42.108 --> 09:25:44.210
IT IN COMMITTEE SO THAT THE TWO

09:25:44.277 --> 09:25:46.712
CAN SPEAK AND WORK IT OUT,

09:25:46.779 --> 09:25:48.381
RATHER THAN MOVE IT OUT OF

09:25:48.447 --> 09:25:49.181
COMMITTEE AND THEN TAKING IT

09:25:49.248 --> 09:25:50.983
DIRECTLY TO THE FLOOR. BECAUSE

09:25:51.050 --> 09:25:53.019
HONESTLY, I I'M TORN HERE. I

09:25:53.085 --> 09:25:54.220
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE SENATOR IS

09:25:54.287 --> 09:25:55.755
DOING, BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND

09:25:55.821 --> 09:25:57.490
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE. I DON'T

09:25:57.556 --> 09:25:58.891
THINK THE TENURE OF THE FREEZING

09:25:58.958 --> 09:26:00.326
OF HIRING IN THE PROBATION

09:26:00.393 --> 09:26:01.227
DEPARTMENT HELPED WITH THIS AT

09:26:01.294 --> 09:26:03.129
ALL. I THINK WE'RE PLAYING CATCH

09:26:03.195 --> 09:26:05.131
UP NOW AND THIS IS WHAT LED TO

09:26:05.197 --> 09:26:06.899
THAT. IN ADDITION TO LAW

09:26:06.966 --> 09:26:07.533
ENFORCEMENT BEING PITCHED AS A

09:26:07.600 --> 09:26:09.468
BAD THING AND NOBODY WANTS TO GO

09:26:09.535 --> 09:26:10.436
INTO EVERYBODY IS DEALING WITH

09:26:10.503 --> 09:26:14.006
THAT RIGHT NOW. I FEEL LIKE AS A

09:26:14.073 --> 09:26:14.607
PERSON IN THE PUBLIC SAFETY

09:26:14.674 --> 09:26:16.242
COMMITTEE, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE

09:26:16.309 --> 09:26:17.810
THIS, COME BACK TO HEAR THIS

09:26:17.877 --> 09:26:18.711
CONVERSATION AND DISCUSS THIS

09:26:18.778 --> 09:26:20.513
THROUGH AS WELL, TO GETTING THIS

09:26:20.579 --> 09:26:22.048
OUT OF THE COMMITTEE TAKES US

09:26:22.114 --> 09:26:23.749
OUT OF THIS, ACTUALLY, AND IT

09:26:23.816 --> 09:26:25.117
JUST BRINGS IT RIGHT TO THE

09:26:25.184 --> 09:26:27.019
FLOOR FOR US TO KIND OF FIGURE

09:26:27.086 --> 09:26:28.821
THIS OUT ON THE FLOOR. AND I

09:26:28.888 --> 09:26:30.856
FEEL LIKE TAKING THIS TO THE

09:26:30.923 --> 09:26:31.757
COMMITTEE SO THAT WE CAN FIGURE

09:26:31.824 --> 09:26:33.726
IT OUT, AND THEN BRINGING IT TO

09:26:33.793 --> 09:26:35.094
THE FLOOR FOR OUR COLLEAGUES IS

09:26:35.161 --> 09:26:36.162
BETTER THAN JUST THROWING IT OUT

09:26:36.228 --> 09:26:38.898
TO THE TO THE FLOOR. SO MAYBE I

09:26:38.964 --> 09:26:42.368
WILL ANSWER NOW, MR. CHAIR. SO,

09:26:42.435 --> 09:26:44.136
ASSEMBLY MEMBER, YOU HAVE BILLS

09:26:44.203 --> 09:26:45.938
YOURSELF. YOU WOULD BE JUST AS

09:26:46.005 --> 09:26:47.740
FRUSTRATED AS I AM. AND

09:26:47.807 --> 09:26:48.908
RESPECTFULLY, YOU'RE ASKING ME

09:26:48.974 --> 09:26:50.242
FOR SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULDN'T

09:26:50.309 --> 09:26:51.911
TAKE EITHER. IF YOUR OPPOSITION

09:26:51.977 --> 09:26:53.312
HAS NOT WORKED WITH YOU IN GOOD

09:26:53.379 --> 09:26:55.014
FAITH, WHY WOULD YOU GIVE YOUR

09:26:55.081 --> 09:26:56.515
OPPOSITION MORE TIME TO WORK IF

09:26:56.582 --> 09:26:58.250
THEY HAVEN'T PROPOSED ANY

09:26:58.317 --> 09:26:59.685
AMENDMENT, AND YOU YOURSELF HAVE

09:26:59.752 --> 09:27:01.053
EMAILED AND EMAILED AND EMAILED

09:27:01.120 --> 09:27:03.656
THE OPPOSITION ASKING FOR HELP

09:27:03.723 --> 09:27:05.358
AND GUIDANCE IN GETTING AND

09:27:05.424 --> 09:27:06.792
LANDING ON THE RIGHT PAGE, AND

09:27:06.859 --> 09:27:08.627
NOT ONE AMENDMENT HAS BEEN

09:27:08.694 --> 09:27:10.396
PROPOSED, YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER

09:27:10.463 --> 09:27:12.565
WOULD NOT BE OKAY WITH THAT

09:27:12.631 --> 09:27:13.366
RELATIONSHIP. YOU'RE ASKING ME

09:27:13.432 --> 09:27:15.468
TO DO SOMETHING THAT YOU I DON'T

09:27:15.534 --> 09:27:16.602
THINK ANY LEGISLATOR WOULD WANT

09:27:16.669 --> 09:27:19.271
TO DO. SO I AM NOT GOING TO TAKE

09:27:19.338 --> 09:27:21.941
THAT THAT THAT PROPOSAL. SO IF I

09:27:22.007 --> 09:27:23.843
PUT IT ON THE FLOOR, THAT PUTS

09:27:23.909 --> 09:27:25.911
MORE FIRE UNDER ELLIE PROBATION

09:27:25.978 --> 09:27:27.446
TO GET THEIR ORGANIZATION IN

09:27:27.513 --> 09:27:29.181
ORDER THAT IF THEY DON'T, I HAVE

09:27:29.248 --> 09:27:31.817
THE ABILITY COME JANUARY 6TH TO

09:27:31.884 --> 09:27:33.886
BRING IT UP FOR A VOTE AND SET

09:27:33.953 --> 09:27:36.021
IT UP TO THE GOVERNOR. BUT IF I

09:27:36.088 --> 09:27:38.124
LEAVE IT IN HERE, THAT'S EVEN A

09:27:38.190 --> 09:27:39.258
LONGER PROCESS, BECAUSE IF

09:27:39.325 --> 09:27:40.726
ANOTHER KID DIES, I'M GOING TO

09:27:40.793 --> 09:27:42.862
BE OFF BECAUSE I'VE ALREADY HAD

09:27:42.928 --> 09:27:45.498
TO TURN THIS INTO A TWO YEAR

09:27:45.564 --> 09:27:46.832
BILL TO GET IT OUT OF COMMITTEE.

09:27:46.899 --> 09:27:49.001
BUT I WANT TO BE READY TO GO IF

09:27:49.068 --> 09:27:50.136
SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENS SO I CAN

09:27:50.202 --> 09:27:51.904
SEND IT UP TO THE GOVERNOR. SO

09:27:51.971 --> 09:27:53.105
RESPECTFULLY, I DON'T WANT TO

09:27:53.172 --> 09:27:54.907
HOLD THAT DEAL WAS NOT TO HOLD

09:27:54.974 --> 09:27:57.543
IT IN HERE BECAUSE I MADE DEALS

09:27:57.610 --> 09:27:58.944
TO GET ENOUGH VOTES OUT OF THIS

09:27:59.011 --> 09:27:59.812
COMMITTEE, AND THAT'S WHAT I'M

09:27:59.879 --> 09:28:05.351
GOING TO BE DOING. MR. GONZALEZ,

09:28:05.418 --> 09:28:07.620
I HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS, AND I

09:28:07.686 --> 09:28:08.921
APOLOGIZE TO MR. CHAIR, WHO I

09:28:08.988 --> 09:28:11.524
KNOW HAS STEPPED OUT. I WAS IN

09:28:11.590 --> 09:28:12.691
HEALTH COMMITTEE AND I WAS

09:28:12.758 --> 09:28:14.026
ADDING ON, ETC, AND I WANT TO

09:28:14.093 --> 09:28:15.628
THANK THE STAFF. I KNOW MISS

09:28:15.694 --> 09:28:17.730
RUBIO'S GOT TO GO TOO AT SOME

09:28:17.797 --> 09:28:19.598
POINT, BUT I DO HAVE A LOT OF

09:28:19.665 --> 09:28:20.933
IMPORTANT QUESTIONS ON THESE

09:28:21.000 --> 09:28:21.801
PIECES FOR ALL SIDES, AND I KNOW

09:28:21.867 --> 09:28:23.702
BOTH SIDES VERY WELL. I COME

09:28:23.769 --> 09:28:25.070
FROM THE SCHOOL OF MR. RALPH

09:28:25.137 --> 09:28:26.806
MILLER, REST HIS SOUL, AND SO I

09:28:26.872 --> 09:28:28.941
AM A HUGE FAN OF LABOR. I KNOW

09:28:29.008 --> 09:28:30.042
THE WORK THAT THE PROBATION

09:28:30.109 --> 09:28:31.444
DEPARTMENT HAS DONE. MY BROTHER

09:28:31.510 --> 09:28:33.479
HAS GONE THROUGH IT, AND I KNOW

09:28:33.546 --> 09:28:34.046
THE BENEFITS THAT COMMUNITY

09:28:34.113 --> 09:28:35.347
BASED ORGANIZATIONS HAVE

09:28:35.414 --> 09:28:36.015
SPECIFICALLY IN MY AREA, DELEON,

09:28:36.081 --> 09:28:38.217
BARRIOS, BARRIO ACTION AND SO

09:28:38.284 --> 09:28:39.685
MANY OTHERS. THIS SOME OF THESE

09:28:39.752 --> 09:28:41.187
PROGRAMS THAT WERE CREATED WERE

09:28:41.253 --> 09:28:43.722
MADE OUT OF MEASURE J, WHICH IS

09:28:43.789 --> 09:28:46.158
PART OF THIS REIMAGINED BALLOT

09:28:46.225 --> 09:28:48.060
MEASURE THAT UTILIZE PUBLIC

09:28:48.127 --> 09:28:49.295
SAFETY DOLLARS TO THEN CREATE

09:28:49.361 --> 09:28:54.133
THIS NEWER GROUP OF PEOPLE TO.

09:28:54.200 --> 09:28:56.135
GET THE YOUTH INTO PROGRAMS AND

09:28:56.202 --> 09:28:59.238
GET THEM OFF THE STREETS AND GET

09:28:59.305 --> 09:28:59.805
THEM INTO PLACES THAT WERE

09:28:59.872 --> 09:29:01.307
FAILING ELSEWHERE. SO I KIND OF

09:29:01.373 --> 09:29:02.141
HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR

09:29:02.208 --> 09:29:04.543
BOTH SIDES ON THIS PIECES OF IT,

09:29:04.610 --> 09:29:07.847
BUT I WANT TO JUST TO SORT OF ON

09:29:07.913 --> 09:29:10.716
THE MEASURE J COMPONENT OF IT.

09:29:10.783 --> 09:29:12.151
THE LA TIMES OBVIOUSLY REPORTED

09:29:12.218 --> 09:29:13.185
THAT STORY THE OTHER DAY, AND

09:29:13.252 --> 09:29:15.688
THIS CAN GO EITHER WAY. DOES

09:29:15.754 --> 09:29:16.789
THAT AFFECT THIS? WELL, I NEED

09:29:16.856 --> 09:29:17.923
SOMEONE TO EXPLAIN THAT PIECE OF

09:29:17.990 --> 09:29:20.359
IT. SORRY. NO, IT DOES NOT. IT

09:29:20.426 --> 09:29:22.127
DOES NOT. IT IS A TECHNICAL

09:29:22.194 --> 09:29:25.130
ADMINISTRATIVE ERROR. THAT WAS

09:29:25.197 --> 09:29:28.367
PART OF THE DAY TO DAY WORK FOR

09:29:28.434 --> 09:29:31.604
WHEN A BALLOT MEASURE IS PASSED.

09:29:31.670 --> 09:29:34.073
LONG STORY SHORT, MEASURE G

09:29:34.139 --> 09:29:35.975
REFORMED OUR COUNTY GOVERNANCE.

09:29:36.041 --> 09:29:38.010
IT DID NOT. IT WAS BASED ON AN

09:29:38.077 --> 09:29:39.645
ON AN UPDATED VERSION OF THE

09:29:39.712 --> 09:29:41.113
CHARTER. IT'S SUPER TECHNICAL

09:29:41.180 --> 09:29:43.415
THAT THE COUNTY COUNCIL AND OUR

09:29:43.482 --> 09:29:44.884
EXECUTIVE OFFICE WAS SUPPOSED TO

09:29:44.950 --> 09:29:46.685
UPDATE. THEY DID NOT. AND THAT

09:29:46.752 --> 09:29:49.555
ACCIDENTALLY, INADVERTENTLY

09:29:49.622 --> 09:29:51.390
UNDID MEASURE J. BUT ONE DOES

09:29:51.457 --> 09:29:53.425
NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH

09:29:53.492 --> 09:29:54.193
PROBATION. PROBATION IS FUNDED

09:29:54.260 --> 09:29:56.362
BY NET COUNTY COST, WHICH IS OUR

09:29:56.428 --> 09:29:57.496
GENERAL FUND DOLLARS. NOT BY

09:29:57.563 --> 09:29:59.865
MEASURE J BUT BUT THE DEED

09:29:59.932 --> 09:30:01.066
PROGRAM AND IF I'M. YES, THE

09:30:01.133 --> 09:30:03.569
DEED PROGRAM NOT FUNDED. NOT

09:30:03.636 --> 09:30:06.338
FUNDED BY THAT AT ALL. NO THAT'S

09:30:06.405 --> 09:30:07.006
THAT'S NOT THAT IS ALL. THAT IS

09:30:07.072 --> 09:30:08.407
NOT MEASURE J R. ALL RIGHT.

09:30:08.474 --> 09:30:11.143
THANK YOU FOR CLEARING THAT UP

09:30:11.210 --> 09:30:11.577
BECAUSE THAT WAS MY

09:30:11.644 --> 09:30:12.211
MISUNDERSTANDING. DID ALL FIVE

09:30:12.278 --> 09:30:14.847
OF THE SUPER ARE ALL FIVE OF THE

09:30:14.914 --> 09:30:15.714
SUPERVISORS IN SUPPORT OF THIS

09:30:15.781 --> 09:30:17.616
BILL? IT WAS UNANIMOUS. YES. AND

09:30:17.683 --> 09:30:19.018
THEN WHAT'S THE TRANSITION WHEN

09:30:19.084 --> 09:30:21.353
THE SUPERVISORS TRANSFERRED FROM

09:30:21.420 --> 09:30:23.022
5 TO 9. ARE THEY MANAGING THIS

09:30:23.088 --> 09:30:24.056
PROGRAM GOING FORWARD? SHOULD IT

09:30:24.123 --> 09:30:26.559
GO? SHOULD IT PASS? THIS WOULD

09:30:26.625 --> 09:30:29.562
BE NO, THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY

09:30:29.628 --> 09:30:32.631
MANAGED BY THE SUPERVISOR. THE

09:30:32.698 --> 09:30:34.133
SUPERVISORIAL DISTRICTS, BECAUSE

09:30:34.199 --> 09:30:36.368
THAT THAT EXPANSION WILL HAPPEN

09:30:36.435 --> 09:30:40.339
IN 2030, 2032 TO 2034. THEY'RE

09:30:40.406 --> 09:30:44.176
BY THEN IN 2028 WILL BE A COUNTY

09:30:44.243 --> 09:30:45.778
EXECUTIVE, MEANING AN EXECUTIVE

09:30:45.844 --> 09:30:47.079
BRANCH OF THE COUNTY WHO WILL BE

09:30:47.146 --> 09:30:50.115
IN CHARGE OF THE WELL, NOT IN

09:30:50.182 --> 09:30:51.817
CHARGE. BUT I GUESS A BETTER WAY

09:30:51.884 --> 09:30:53.185
OF SAYING WILL BE IN CHARGE OF

09:30:53.252 --> 09:30:55.020
APPOINTING ALL OF THE DEPARTMENT

09:30:55.087 --> 09:30:56.722
HEADS. AND SO IT'S THE COUNTY

09:30:56.789 --> 09:30:59.391
EXECUTIVE. TECHNICALLY, WITH THE

09:30:59.458 --> 09:31:01.193
VOTE OF THE LEGISLATURE, WHICH

09:31:01.260 --> 09:31:02.828
WILL BE THE EXPANDED BOARD, WHO

09:31:02.895 --> 09:31:04.330
WILL BE IN CHARGE TOGETHER.

09:31:04.396 --> 09:31:05.264
ASSEMBLY MEMBER, JUST LIKE ANY

09:31:05.331 --> 09:31:06.932
OTHER DEPARTMENT IN L.A. COUNTY,

09:31:06.999 --> 09:31:09.068
DCFS, TÃM, AND SO FORTH, ALL

09:31:09.134 --> 09:31:10.669
THOSE DEPARTMENTS ARE NOT GOING

09:31:10.736 --> 09:31:12.771
TO CHANGE WHEN THE BOARD

09:31:12.838 --> 09:31:15.274
INCREASES TO NINE SUPERVISORS.

09:31:15.341 --> 09:31:17.042
THAT WILL REMAIN THE SAME. I

09:31:17.109 --> 09:31:19.912
JUST WANTED JUST ONE CORRECTION

09:31:19.979 --> 09:31:21.447
TO THAT, AND THEY MAY NOT KNOW

09:31:21.513 --> 09:31:25.384
THIS. IN MAY OF 2016, THERE WAS

09:31:25.451 --> 09:31:27.419
AN ORDINANCE BY THE BOARD OF

09:31:27.486 --> 09:31:28.921
SUPERVISORS THAT THERE ARE TWO

09:31:28.988 --> 09:31:30.422
ENTITIES IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY

09:31:30.489 --> 09:31:32.091
THAT ARE DIRECTLY UNDER THE

09:31:32.157 --> 09:31:33.659
SUPERVISION OF THE BOARD OF

09:31:33.726 --> 09:31:34.593
SUPERVISORS, AND THAT WAS

09:31:34.660 --> 09:31:36.395
PROBATION AND DCFS. SO THEY

09:31:36.462 --> 09:31:37.997
DON'T GO THROUGH THE NORMAL

09:31:38.063 --> 09:31:39.598
CHANNEL OF THE CEO'S OFFICE. I

09:31:39.665 --> 09:31:41.233
DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS UNDONE BY

09:31:41.300 --> 09:31:44.436
MR. G, THOUGH. NO. WELL, WELL,

09:31:44.503 --> 09:31:45.938
MR. J, JUST TO MAKE SORRY,

09:31:46.005 --> 09:31:48.941
SORRY, SORRY. OKAY. SO LOOK, I

09:31:49.008 --> 09:31:50.442
WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND

09:31:50.509 --> 09:31:53.012
I'LL GET TO THE AUTHOR IN A

09:31:53.078 --> 09:31:54.380
SECOND. BUT LET ME ASK THIS

09:31:54.446 --> 09:31:54.980
FIRST. A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS

09:31:55.047 --> 09:31:56.982
ABOUT LOSS OF JOBS, PARTICULARLY

09:31:57.049 --> 09:31:59.151
UNION JOBS, PARTICULARLY THAT

09:31:59.218 --> 09:32:01.320
THIS IS A UNION BUSTING BILL.

09:32:01.387 --> 09:32:03.622
BUT IN PART OF THE AMENDMENTS

09:32:03.689 --> 09:32:05.891
THAT THE AUTHOR TOOK, IT SAYS IT

09:32:05.958 --> 09:32:07.993
HERE IN A FEW PLACES, THE COUNTY

09:32:08.060 --> 09:32:09.261
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SHALL

09:32:09.328 --> 09:32:11.563
DELEGATE ALL OR PART OF THESE

09:32:11.630 --> 09:32:12.431
DUTIES AND AUTHORITIES TO A

09:32:12.498 --> 09:32:13.165
COUNTY OFFICIAL THAT IS PART OF

09:32:13.232 --> 09:32:15.734
A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNIT. IS

09:32:15.801 --> 09:32:17.403
THAT NOT ACCEPTABLE? AND IF IT'S

09:32:17.469 --> 09:32:19.638
NOT, WHY NOT? WELL, WE HAD

09:32:19.705 --> 09:32:20.873
DISCUSSION EARLIER WHEN YOU WERE

09:32:20.939 --> 09:32:23.308
OUT. YES. AND ONE OF THE THINGS

09:32:23.375 --> 09:32:24.309
THAT IS MENTIONED THERE, THAT

09:32:24.376 --> 09:32:27.346
IT'S NOT THE LOSS OF A CURRENT

09:32:27.413 --> 09:32:30.015
JOB, CURRENT PEACE OFFICER, THE

09:32:30.082 --> 09:32:31.884
UNION IS CONCERNED THAT IT'S THE

09:32:31.950 --> 09:32:34.720
LOSS OF A UNION POSITION. IN

09:32:34.787 --> 09:32:38.290
OTHER WORDS, THE BILL IS WRITTEN

09:32:38.357 --> 09:32:41.994
TO SAY CURRENT EMPLOYED OFFICER,

09:32:42.061 --> 09:32:43.762
WHICH MEANS THAT I AM CURRENT

09:32:43.829 --> 09:32:45.097
EMPLOYED OFFICER, 33 YEARS AS A

09:32:45.164 --> 09:32:47.599
JUVENILE OFFICER. IF I LOST MY

09:32:47.666 --> 09:32:50.135
JOB RIGHT OR NOT BECAUSE OF

09:32:50.202 --> 09:32:54.473
THAT, IF I JUST RETIRED, THEN OF

09:32:54.540 --> 09:32:56.075
COURSE THEY COULD REPLACE IT

09:32:56.141 --> 09:32:58.744
WITH A NONUNION PERSON BECAUSE

09:32:58.811 --> 09:33:00.245
IT DOESN'T GIVE ANY GUARANTEE

09:33:00.312 --> 09:33:03.615
THAT THE POSITION WILL BE HELD.

09:33:03.682 --> 09:33:05.718
AND SO WE CALL IT ANTI-UNION

09:33:05.784 --> 09:33:08.654
BECAUSE IT USES THE WORDING IS

09:33:08.721 --> 09:33:09.688
IMPORTANT. IT USES THE TERM

09:33:09.755 --> 09:33:11.924
CURRENT. WHAT ABOUT FUTURE? WHAT

09:33:11.990 --> 09:33:13.992
ABOUT FUTURE OFFICERS? DOES IT

09:33:14.059 --> 09:33:16.228
TAKE CARE OF THAT? WHICH FUTURE

09:33:16.295 --> 09:33:17.830
OFFICERS? THE ONES THAT NEED TO

09:33:17.896 --> 09:33:20.499
BE HIRED SEE IT? IT ONLY SAYS

09:33:20.566 --> 09:33:22.034
THAT THE LOSS OF JOBS WILL NOT

09:33:22.101 --> 09:33:25.204
AFFECT THE CURRENT OFFICERS,

09:33:25.270 --> 09:33:29.475
RIGHT? YOU PLAN. YOU DO PLAN TO

09:33:29.541 --> 09:33:31.443
HAVE FUTURE OFFICERS. BUT IF THE

09:33:31.510 --> 09:33:34.113
BILL IS RE IS COMPLETELY

09:33:34.179 --> 09:33:35.647
CHANGING THE OR MOVING THE

09:33:35.714 --> 09:33:37.082
DEPARTMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY TO

09:33:37.149 --> 09:33:38.584
CHANGING IT. AND IT'S THE

09:33:38.650 --> 09:33:39.952
PROVISION IS PART OF THE

09:33:40.018 --> 09:33:41.053
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNIT. THAT

09:33:41.120 --> 09:33:42.755
UNIT WOULD THEN THEREFORE BE

09:33:42.821 --> 09:33:43.388
UNIONIZED SO THE POSITIONS WOULD

09:33:43.455 --> 09:33:45.858
STILL EXIST. YOU'RE SAYING THAT

09:33:45.924 --> 09:33:47.226
IT'S NOT. THERE'S TWO THINGS.

09:33:47.292 --> 09:33:49.161
I'M SORRY. I JUST WANT TO MAKE

09:33:49.228 --> 09:33:51.296
SURE WE MAKE SURE WE'RE CLEAR.

09:33:51.363 --> 09:33:51.830
THERE'S TWO THINGS THAT I

09:33:51.897 --> 09:33:54.333
THOUGHT I SAW IN THE AMENDMENT.

09:33:54.399 --> 09:33:55.100
ONE WAS THAT THE HEAD OF THE

09:33:55.167 --> 09:33:57.603
PROBATION DEPARTMENT NEED TO BE

09:33:57.669 --> 09:33:58.270
PART OF A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

09:33:58.337 --> 09:34:00.139
UNIT. I DON'T CLEARLY KNOW WHAT

09:34:00.205 --> 09:34:01.173
THAT MEANS IN TERMS OF A

09:34:01.240 --> 09:34:03.008
DEPARTMENT HEAD. NONE OF THEM

09:34:03.075 --> 09:34:04.710
ARE PART OF A COLLECTIVE

09:34:04.777 --> 09:34:06.912
BARGAINING UNIT, PER SE. AND

09:34:06.979 --> 09:34:08.914
THEN THERE'S THE PART THAT TALKS

09:34:08.981 --> 09:34:10.616
ABOUT THERE WILL BE NO LOSS OF

09:34:10.682 --> 09:34:12.684
THE CURRENT OFFICER. THE WORD

09:34:12.751 --> 09:34:14.920
CURRENT IS CONFUSING. WE HAD A

09:34:14.987 --> 09:34:16.889
WE HAD A DISCUSSION ON CLARITY.

09:34:16.955 --> 09:34:18.457
WHEN THE BILL IS PRESENTED. I

09:34:18.524 --> 09:34:19.992
WAS HOPING IT WOULD BE CLEARER

09:34:20.058 --> 09:34:22.661
ON ITS MEANING. THAT IS UNCLEAR

09:34:22.728 --> 09:34:25.164
BECAUSE IT TALKS ABOUT CURRENT

09:34:25.230 --> 09:34:27.099
OFFICERS. IT DOESN'T TALK ABOUT

09:34:27.166 --> 09:34:28.934
MAINTAINING THE POSITION IN THE

09:34:29.001 --> 09:34:30.202
BARGAINING UNIT. IT JUST SAYS

09:34:30.269 --> 09:34:32.471
THAT THERE WILL BE NO LOSS OF A

09:34:32.538 --> 09:34:34.406
CURRENT EMPLOYMENT. SO. SO

09:34:34.473 --> 09:34:36.074
SHOULD THIS GET OUT OF COMMITTEE

09:34:36.141 --> 09:34:38.644
TODAY? AND KEEPING IN MIND THE

09:34:38.710 --> 09:34:40.112
DEFINITION OF THAT PIECE, AS

09:34:40.179 --> 09:34:43.348
MUCH AS YOU CAN RESPOND TO,

09:34:43.415 --> 09:34:45.117
SENATOR, IS THAT WILL THAT BE

09:34:45.184 --> 09:34:46.485
PART OF THE DIALOG? SHOULD THEY

09:34:46.552 --> 09:34:48.387
YOU GUYS BE FORCED INTO A

09:34:48.453 --> 09:34:49.488
CONVERSATION THAT I WISH SOMEONE

09:34:49.555 --> 09:34:50.489
WOULD FORCE US INTO A

09:34:50.556 --> 09:34:51.190
CONVERSATION? MAYBE THAT

09:34:51.256 --> 09:34:52.991
POSITION WOULD TALK TO ME ABOUT

09:34:53.058 --> 09:34:55.227
THIS BILL. BUT WHAT I ANSWERED

09:34:55.294 --> 09:34:56.094
BEFORE IS THAT THERE'S A

09:34:56.161 --> 09:34:57.362
PREVIOUS AMENDMENT THAT I

09:34:57.429 --> 09:34:59.064
ALREADY TOOK TO THE BILL, THAT

09:34:59.131 --> 09:35:00.399
IT'S NOT PART OF COMMITTEE

09:35:00.465 --> 09:35:01.700
AMENDMENTS. THESE WERE MY

09:35:01.767 --> 09:35:03.502
AMENDMENTS THAT SAID NO PEACE

09:35:03.569 --> 09:35:05.337
OFFICER DUTY ROLE SHALL BE

09:35:05.404 --> 09:35:07.105
REPLACED BY A NON PEACE OFFICER

09:35:07.172 --> 09:35:09.675
DUTY. SO TO HIS POINT THAT IF

09:35:09.741 --> 09:35:11.043
SOMEONE RETIRES AND LEAVES THE

09:35:11.109 --> 09:35:12.945
FORCE, A PEACE OFFICER CAN ONLY

09:35:13.011 --> 09:35:15.080
BE REPLACED BY ANOTHER PEACE

09:35:15.147 --> 09:35:16.782
OFFICER. SO EVEN THOUGH IT SAYS

09:35:16.849 --> 09:35:17.783
CURRENTLY A DIFFERENT AMENDMENT

09:35:17.850 --> 09:35:21.887
ALREADY ADDRESSES THE ISSUE TO

09:35:21.954 --> 09:35:23.622
REPLACING A PEACE OFFICER WITH

09:35:23.689 --> 09:35:25.123
ANOTHER PEACE OFFICER. AND IN

09:35:25.190 --> 09:35:26.859
OUR CONVERSATIONS, THIS IS NOT

09:35:26.925 --> 09:35:28.327
AN ATTACK ON LABOR. IT'S AN

09:35:28.393 --> 09:35:29.494
ATTACK ON A SYSTEM THAT'S

09:35:29.561 --> 09:35:31.129
FAILING, AND IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE

09:35:31.196 --> 09:35:32.698
REHABILITATING OUR YOUTH. AND SO

09:35:32.764 --> 09:35:34.466
THAT THAT'S THE CLEAR

09:35:34.533 --> 09:35:35.234
DISTINCTION I WANT TO MAKE. AND

09:35:35.300 --> 09:35:37.870
YOU AND I AND I WANT TO GIVE,

09:35:37.936 --> 09:35:39.371
GIVE SOME KUDOS TO THE AUTHOR.

09:35:39.438 --> 09:35:41.039
WE HAD A VERY TOUGH CONVERSATION

09:35:41.106 --> 09:35:42.140
AND WE GOT TO WE GOT TO THIS

09:35:42.207 --> 09:35:43.876
POINT IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS,

09:35:43.942 --> 09:35:45.811
AND I SPOKE TO MANY FOLKS AROUND

09:35:45.878 --> 09:35:47.379
THE DAIS TODAY ABOUT THAT. AND

09:35:47.446 --> 09:35:49.948
YOU'VE HAD THREE YEARS TO DO IT.

09:35:50.015 --> 09:35:52.584
SO AS PART OF THAT AND YOU'VE

09:35:52.651 --> 09:35:54.186
BEEN WORKING ON IT AND THERE'S A

09:35:54.253 --> 09:35:55.654
MASSIVE TIMELINE, AND THIS IS A

09:35:55.721 --> 09:35:56.755
LITTLE BIT MORE DIRECTED TO

09:35:56.822 --> 09:35:58.790
PROBATION TEAM. IN OCTOBER OF

09:35:58.857 --> 09:35:59.324
2019, BOARD OF SUPERVISORS

09:35:59.391 --> 09:36:00.292
APPROVED THE CREATION OF THE

09:36:00.359 --> 09:36:01.460
NATION'S FIRST PROBATION

09:36:01.526 --> 09:36:03.595
OVERSIGHT COMMISSION. 2019, AND

09:36:03.662 --> 09:36:05.030
THEN THIS TIMELINE GOES ON TO

09:36:05.097 --> 09:36:07.165
SAY, IN THE FIRST IN JULY OF

09:36:07.232 --> 09:36:09.034
2022, IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS,

09:36:09.101 --> 09:36:10.269
INCIDENTS INVOLVING OFFICERS

09:36:10.335 --> 09:36:11.837
USING FORCE ON A YOUTH JUMPED BY

09:36:11.904 --> 09:36:14.139
50% COMPARED TO THE FIRST HALF

09:36:14.206 --> 09:36:15.240
OF 2021, AND THE NUMBER OF TIMES

09:36:15.307 --> 09:36:16.174
THAT YOUTHS WERE PAPERS WERE

09:36:16.241 --> 09:36:18.043
PEPPER SPRAYED, QUADRUPLED IN

09:36:18.110 --> 09:36:20.212
THE SAME TIME FRAME. AND THEN IN

09:36:20.279 --> 09:36:22.281
AUGUST OF 22, 70 WOMEN FILED

09:36:22.347 --> 09:36:23.348
LAWSUITS ALLEGING SEXUAL ASSAULT

09:36:23.415 --> 09:36:24.850
AGAINST L.A. COUNTY JUVENILE

09:36:24.917 --> 09:36:26.285
PROBATION OFFICERS. NOVEMBER OF

09:36:26.351 --> 09:36:27.753
22 MAJOR STAFFING ISSUES

09:36:27.819 --> 09:36:29.354
CONTINUE, INCLUDING 27% OF

09:36:29.421 --> 09:36:31.590
JUVENILE HALL EMPLOYEES OR 329

09:36:31.657 --> 09:36:33.525
OFFICERS ARE OUT ON LEAVE ON A

LIGHT DUTY. UNSAFE CONDITIONS

09:36:35.027 --> 09:36:36.728
PERSIST FOR YOUTH IN AT LEAST

09:36:36.795 --> 09:36:38.263
SEVEN MONTHS. JULY OF 23, L.A.

09:36:38.330 --> 09:36:39.665

EVENTS ON SPOTLIGHTING ON THE

09:37:41.793 --> 09:37:44.062
PROBATION DEPARTMENT? DO YOU

09:37:44.129 --> 09:37:45.797
WANT ME TO TAKE IT ONE BY ONE?

09:37:45.864 --> 09:37:47.499
YOU CAN TELL ME HOW TO DEFEND.

09:37:47.566 --> 09:37:50.469
WELL, LET ME JUST GIVE YOU AN

09:37:50.535 --> 09:37:51.136
OVERVIEW. FIRST OF ALL, THERE IS

09:37:51.203 --> 09:37:52.537
A STAFFING SHORTAGE IN L.A.

09:37:52.604 --> 09:37:55.040
COUNTY. PROBATION. THE BOARD OF

09:37:55.107 --> 09:37:56.208
SUPERVISORS FOR YEARS HAD A

09:37:56.274 --> 09:37:58.010
HIRING FREEZE, AND NOW THEY'RE

09:37:58.076 --> 09:37:59.411
PLAYING CATCH UP. ATTRITION

09:37:59.478 --> 09:38:01.613
RATES OUTNUMBER THE HIRING RATES

09:38:01.680 --> 09:38:03.715
BECAUSE OF THE IDEOLOGY THAT NO

09:38:03.782 --> 09:38:06.318
YOUTH SHOULD BE INCARCERATED. LA

09:38:06.385 --> 09:38:07.753
COUNTY USED TO HOUSE 3000 YOUTH

09:38:07.819 --> 09:38:10.689
IN ONE DAY. WE NOW HAVE LIMITED

09:38:10.756 --> 09:38:13.859
THAT TO 500 TO 600 YOUTH AT ANY

09:38:13.925 --> 09:38:16.728
ONE TIME. IF YOU TALK ABOUT THE

09:38:16.795 --> 09:38:17.696
LAWSUITS ON THE SEXUAL

09:38:17.763 --> 09:38:19.898
ALLEGATIONS, YOU SAID THERE WERE

09:38:19.965 --> 09:38:21.767
70 CASES. THE MAJORITY OF THE

09:38:21.833 --> 09:38:25.570
CASES THAT EXIST ARE FOR PEOPLE

09:38:25.637 --> 09:38:27.305
WHO ARE NOT CURRENTLY EMPLOYED.

09:38:27.372 --> 09:38:31.443
IT GOES BACK 30 TO 40 YEARS. NO

09:38:31.510 --> 09:38:33.979
JUSTIFICATION FOR THAT. WHAT I

09:38:34.046 --> 09:38:36.348
SAID EARLIER WAS THE STATE OF

09:38:36.415 --> 09:38:37.682
CALIFORNIA HAS MANDATED THAT

09:38:37.749 --> 09:38:40.152
PROBATION EXIST. IN 2000, THERE

09:38:40.218 --> 09:38:41.987
WAS PROBATION SERVICES TASK

09:38:42.054 --> 09:38:44.489
FORCE THAT THE STATE OF

09:38:44.556 --> 09:38:45.390
CALIFORNIA GAVE THEM THREE YEARS

09:38:45.457 --> 09:38:47.559
TO DO THE PROPER REVIEW TO MAKE

09:38:47.626 --> 09:38:50.262
SURE THAT PROBATION BE REFORMED.

09:38:50.328 --> 09:38:56.068
IN JULY OF 2003, THEY PRODUCED A

09:38:56.134 --> 09:38:58.470
549 PAGE REPORT AND MADE 17

09:38:58.537 --> 09:39:00.305
RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE STATE. IN

09:39:00.372 --> 09:39:02.874
THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE THE

09:39:02.941 --> 09:39:05.043
THINGS THAT WILL CAUSE US TO

09:39:05.110 --> 09:39:06.678
HAVE THE REFORMS WE NEED IN

09:39:06.745 --> 09:39:08.580
PROBATION. WHERE WE OBJECT WITH

09:39:08.647 --> 09:39:10.382
THE AUTHOR IS THE AUTHOR IS

09:39:10.449 --> 09:39:12.984
TRYING TO GO OUTSIDE OF THE

09:39:13.051 --> 09:39:15.053
PROBATION DEPARTMENT TO CURE A

09:39:15.120 --> 09:39:17.222
PROBLEM THAT EXISTS INSIDE THE

09:39:17.289 --> 09:39:19.257
PROBATION DEPARTMENT, FOR

09:39:19.324 --> 09:39:21.593
INSTANCE, THE USE OF DIED WHO

09:39:21.660 --> 09:39:23.895
HAS NOT BEEN IN EXISTENCE LONGER

09:39:23.962 --> 09:39:26.598
THAN TWO AND A HALF YEARS, HAVE

09:39:26.665 --> 09:39:29.401
NOT HAD TO TREAT OR TO HANDLE

09:39:29.468 --> 09:39:30.936
THE POPULATION THAT WE CURRENTLY

09:39:31.002 --> 09:39:34.306
HANDLE, WHICH IS 770 OFFENDERS.

09:39:34.372 --> 09:39:36.741
HIGH LEVEL VIOLATIONS, RAPE,

09:39:36.808 --> 09:39:38.777
MURDERS AND SUCH. FORTH. RIGHT.

09:39:38.844 --> 09:39:40.412
AND SO WHEN YOU WHEN YOU BRING

09:39:40.479 --> 09:39:42.114
UP THESE THINGS, SOMEBODY EVEN

09:39:42.180 --> 09:39:43.782
SAID THERE'S A CALL OUT RATIO

09:39:43.849 --> 09:39:46.017
THAT'S HIGH BECAUSE OF THE

09:39:46.084 --> 09:39:48.386
STAFFING SHORTAGE. THE CHIEF HAS

09:39:48.453 --> 09:39:50.355
DESIGNED IN HIS MIND TO GO AND

09:39:50.422 --> 09:39:52.023
USE FIELD OFFICERS THAT WORK

09:39:52.090 --> 09:39:54.392
WITH ADULTS AND SEND THEM INTO

09:39:54.459 --> 09:39:56.094
THE INSTITUTIONS. SOME OF THEM

09:39:56.161 --> 09:39:59.131
ARE HELD OVER 16, SOME OF THEM

09:39:59.197 --> 09:40:00.499
WORK 24 HOURS AND THEIR SHIFT

09:40:00.565 --> 09:40:02.667
STARTS THE NEXT DAY. CAN YOU

09:40:02.734 --> 09:40:04.703
IMAGINE WORKING 16 TO 24 HOURS

09:40:04.769 --> 09:40:06.671
WHEN YOU'RE USED TO WORKING

09:40:06.738 --> 09:40:07.873
EIGHT HOURS AND THEN YOU HAVE TO

09:40:07.939 --> 09:40:09.541
GO BACK? THAT'S CALLED A CALL

09:40:09.608 --> 09:40:11.610
OUT. A LOT OF TECHNICALITIES ARE

09:40:11.676 --> 09:40:14.179
THERE THAT CAN BE EXPLAINED. AND

09:40:14.246 --> 09:40:15.213
WE'VE SPOKEN TO MANY OF YOU

09:40:15.280 --> 09:40:17.349
OFFICERS AND TRIED TO GIVE CLEAR

09:40:17.415 --> 09:40:19.851
DEFINITION. WHAT WE BELIEVE IS

09:40:19.918 --> 09:40:21.820
THAT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO LOOK

09:40:21.887 --> 09:40:23.021
IN PROBATION AND MAKE THE

09:40:23.088 --> 09:40:25.490
REFORMS THAT YOU NEED. FOR

09:40:25.557 --> 09:40:27.759
INSTANCE, IF YOU TALK ABOUT THE

09:40:27.826 --> 09:40:29.694
SENATOR MENTIONED ABOUT THE JJ,

09:40:29.761 --> 09:40:31.796
BG OR WHATEVER IT IS, BUT 2000,

09:40:31.863 --> 09:40:33.832
IT WAS CALLED THE SHIFT CARDENAS

09:40:33.899 --> 09:40:36.334
THAT ALLOCATED MONEY TOWARD

09:40:36.401 --> 09:40:37.936
JUVENILES. THEN THEY CHANGED IT

09:40:38.003 --> 09:40:39.271
TO THE JUVENILE JUSTICE

09:40:39.337 --> 09:40:40.438
COORDINATING COUNCIL. THEN THEY

09:40:40.505 --> 09:40:42.407
PUT THE CHIEF ON THE HEAD OF

09:40:42.474 --> 09:40:46.178
THAT IN THAT FUNDING, WE

09:40:46.244 --> 09:40:49.247
ALLOCATE OVER 75 MILLION TO 100

09:40:49.314 --> 09:40:51.183
MILLION TO CBOS. THE WORK THAT

09:40:51.249 --> 09:40:53.318
WE SEE IN THE BILL THAT THE

09:40:53.385 --> 09:40:56.488
AUTHOR IS ASKING TO BE DONE TO,

09:40:56.555 --> 09:40:59.925
IN HER MIND, ASSIST PROBATION IS

09:40:59.991 --> 09:41:02.360
ALREADY FREELY GIVEN TO CBOS,

09:41:02.427 --> 09:41:03.995
FBO, FBO, FAITH BASED

09:41:04.062 --> 09:41:05.230
ORGANIZATION, AND OTHER

09:41:05.297 --> 09:41:07.465
ORGANIZATIONS. WE DON'T SEE ANY

09:41:07.532 --> 09:41:09.100
HINDRANCE FROM DIED COMING INTO

09:41:09.167 --> 09:41:11.002
THE INSTITUTION AND PROVIDING

09:41:11.069 --> 09:41:12.771
THOSE SERVICES, SO WE DON'T SEE

09:41:12.837 --> 09:41:14.139
WHY WE NEED TO GO AND CHANGE

09:41:14.206 --> 09:41:17.142
STATE LAWS, STATE MANDATED. AND

09:41:17.209 --> 09:41:19.678
THEN LASTLY, I'LL SAY THE IDEA

09:41:19.744 --> 09:41:22.514
THAT THE OPPOSITION HAS NOT

09:41:22.581 --> 09:41:25.350
TALKED IN GOOD FAITH TO THE

09:41:25.417 --> 09:41:27.886
AUTHOR. WE VISIT THE AUTHOR MANY

09:41:27.953 --> 09:41:29.721
TIMES. THE THIS IS NOT THE

09:41:29.788 --> 09:41:32.757
AUTHOR FIRST BILL ON ATTACK ON

09:41:32.824 --> 09:41:35.227
PROBATION. THERE'S SB 987 THAT

09:41:35.293 --> 09:41:36.861
TRIED TO MOVE OUR PRETRIAL

09:41:36.928 --> 09:41:38.530
OFFICERS UNDER JACCARD JUSTICE

09:41:38.597 --> 09:41:40.498
CARE OPPORTUNITIES DEPARTMENT,

09:41:40.565 --> 09:41:41.700
ANOTHER COUNTY DEPARTMENT THAT

09:41:41.766 --> 09:41:43.401
WAS JUST NEWLY CREATED. LET'S

09:41:43.468 --> 09:41:45.203
STICK TO THE MERITS OF THIS

09:41:45.270 --> 09:41:45.837
BILL, PLEASE, EVERYBODY. WELL,

WE WILL TAKE AS MUCH TIME AS WE

09:41:55.647 --> 09:41:56.448
NEED. BUT ALL I WOULD ASK IS,

09:41:56.514 --> 09:41:57.749
LET'S PLEASE CONFINE OUR

09:41:57.816 --> 09:41:59.050

DUPLICATING ANY EFFORTS ON

09:42:26.978 --> 09:42:28.413
QUESTIONS I MIGHT BE ASKING. I

09:42:28.480 --> 09:42:30.849
WAS LISTENING AS I WAS ON MY WAY

09:42:30.915 --> 09:42:32.217
OVER HERE, BUT MIGHT HAVE NOT

09:42:32.284 --> 09:42:33.285
HAVE UNDERSTOOD IF

09:42:33.351 --> 09:42:34.919
ACCOUNTABILITY WAS TAKEN ON ALL

09:42:34.986 --> 09:42:37.122
SIDES. THE QUESTION ABOUT THE

09:42:37.188 --> 09:42:38.423
TWO YEAR BILL, WHETHER IT'S

09:42:38.490 --> 09:42:39.924
EITHER OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE OR

09:42:39.991 --> 09:42:41.493
WHETHER IT'S ON THE FLOOR

09:42:41.559 --> 09:42:42.794
CONFIRMING WHETHER OR NOT

09:42:42.861 --> 09:42:43.962
PROBATION AND THE SENATOR WILL

09:42:44.029 --> 09:42:46.197
WORK TOGETHER, I THINK IS STILL

09:42:46.264 --> 09:42:47.799
IN QUESTION. TO PIGGYBACK ON MY

09:42:47.866 --> 09:42:49.901
COLLEAGUE, MR. NGUYEN SAID IS

09:42:49.968 --> 09:42:52.270
ABOUT PROBATION AND THE AUTHOR

09:42:52.337 --> 09:42:54.306
WORKING TOGETHER. AND SO I'M

09:42:54.372 --> 09:42:57.208
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF, IF, IF

09:42:57.275 --> 09:42:59.778
IT GETS IT OUT OF TODAY OR THIS

09:42:59.844 --> 09:43:00.845
BILL DOES NOT GET OUT OF

09:43:00.912 --> 09:43:03.081
COMMITTEE, DOES THE PROBLEM JUST

09:43:03.148 --> 09:43:04.883
FESTER AND CONTINUE? AND THAT'S

09:43:04.949 --> 09:43:07.619
GOING TO BE ON ALL OF US WHO ARE

09:43:07.686 --> 09:43:09.688
HERE TO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT. IF

09:43:09.754 --> 09:43:10.488
WE DON'T DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS

09:43:10.555 --> 09:43:12.223
TODAY, THEN THE PROBLEM GETS

09:43:12.290 --> 09:43:13.792
WORSE. AND NO, NOBODY'S FEET ARE

09:43:13.858 --> 09:43:16.695
HELD TO THE FIRE ON THAT. IF IT

09:43:16.761 --> 09:43:17.996
DOES GET OUT TODAY AND IT'S

09:43:18.063 --> 09:43:18.863
GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS THAT

09:43:18.930 --> 09:43:20.632
THE SENATOR MENTIONED AND AGREED

09:43:20.699 --> 09:43:22.334
TO, THEN PROBATION NEEDS TO TAKE

09:43:22.400 --> 09:43:24.202
THAT ACTION TO ADDRESS THESE

09:43:24.269 --> 09:43:26.404
ISSUES. DID AND PROBATION NEED

09:43:26.471 --> 09:43:27.472
TO COLLABORATE OR TRANSFER THOSE

09:43:27.539 --> 09:43:30.075
DUTIES TO DM. SOMETHING HAS TO

09:43:30.141 --> 09:43:31.609
HAPPEN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT

09:43:31.676 --> 09:43:33.611
ANSWER IS, BUT BUT SOMETHING HAS

09:43:33.678 --> 09:43:35.213
TO HAPPEN. AND SO I KNOW THAT

09:43:35.280 --> 09:43:36.781
WE'RE ALL SORT OF TALKING IN

09:43:36.848 --> 09:43:38.283
CIRCLES HERE, BUT AND I DON'T

09:43:38.350 --> 09:43:40.118
KNOW IF THE SENATOR WANTS TO

09:43:40.185 --> 09:43:42.053
ANSWER THE PIECE ON THE TWO YEAR

09:43:42.120 --> 09:43:43.021
COMPONENT, WHETHER WE KEEP IT

09:43:43.088 --> 09:43:45.190
HERE OR YOU WORK WITH EACH

09:43:45.256 --> 09:43:46.825
OTHER. BUT I JUST NEED YOU BOTH

09:43:46.891 --> 09:43:47.692
TO SAY THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO

09:43:47.759 --> 09:43:49.661
WORK TOGETHER ON THIS TO GET

09:43:49.728 --> 09:43:51.196
THIS DONE. AND IF IT'S IF THE

09:43:51.262 --> 09:43:52.163
SENATOR IS SAYING SHE'S NOT

09:43:52.230 --> 09:43:55.200
HEARD FROM YOUR FOLKS ON THIS, I

09:43:55.266 --> 09:43:57.001
WILL BELIEVE HER. BUT IF YOU'RE

09:43:57.068 --> 09:43:57.969
IF YOU'RE SAYING OTHERWISE, I

09:43:58.036 --> 09:43:59.637
DON'T KNOW. I DON'T HAVE THE

09:43:59.704 --> 09:44:01.406
PROOF TO SHOWCASE THAT. BUT I

09:44:01.473 --> 09:44:02.907
DON'T LIKE THAT WE'RE IN THIS

09:44:02.974 --> 09:44:04.776
POSITION. IF NONE OF YOU HAVE

09:44:04.843 --> 09:44:06.544
BEEN TALKING, AND THIS HAS BEEN

09:44:06.611 --> 09:44:07.245
THREE YEARS THAT SHE'S BEEN

09:44:07.312 --> 09:44:08.046
TRYING TO GET THIS ISSUE

09:44:08.113 --> 09:44:09.114
THROUGH, AND RATHER THAN THE

09:44:09.180 --> 09:44:11.683
PROBLEM GETTING FIXED, IT'S ONLY

09:44:11.750 --> 09:44:14.018
GOTTEN WORSE. SO I DON'T KNOW

09:44:14.085 --> 09:44:16.054
WHO WANTS TO RESPOND TO THE TWO

09:44:16.121 --> 09:44:17.122
YEAR COMPONENT. THAT'S UP TO

09:44:17.188 --> 09:44:18.990
YOU. OR IF MR. BYRD WANTS TO

09:44:19.057 --> 09:44:20.058
RESPOND AS WELL THROUGH THE

09:44:20.125 --> 09:44:21.926
CHAIR. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT

09:44:21.993 --> 09:44:23.962
ME TO RESPOND TO IT AGAIN, IF

09:44:24.028 --> 09:44:26.564
YOU'D LIKE. OKAY, I CAN IF YOU

09:44:26.631 --> 09:44:27.465
PREFER. YOU KNOW, AS I REMEMBER,

09:44:27.532 --> 09:44:29.768
YOU AND I SPOKE ABOUT THIS AND

09:44:29.834 --> 09:44:31.603
ACTUALLY THIS DEAL WAS MADE

09:44:31.669 --> 09:44:32.470
AFTER A CONVERSATION WITH THE

09:44:32.537 --> 09:44:35.540
ASSEMBLY MEMBER AS I NEEDED THAT

09:44:35.607 --> 09:44:37.375
THAT LAST SUPPORT TO GET IT OUT

09:44:37.442 --> 09:44:38.843
OF HERE. AND WHEN I MENTIONED TO

09:44:38.910 --> 09:44:40.612
THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS, LISTEN,

09:44:40.678 --> 09:44:43.181
I NEED IT AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE

09:44:43.248 --> 09:44:44.416
TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK AS, AS

09:44:44.482 --> 09:44:47.018
CAN BE TO ENSURE THAT SHOULD

09:44:47.085 --> 09:44:49.220
NOTHING CHANGE OUT OF THIS

09:44:49.287 --> 09:44:50.155
CONVERSATION, THAT WE CAN BE

09:44:50.221 --> 09:44:51.956
READY TO GO AND SEND IT UP. THE

09:44:52.023 --> 09:44:54.125
ASSEMBLY MEMBER SUGGESTED OTHER

09:44:54.192 --> 09:44:55.193
THINGS, LIKE A HEARING ON IT

09:44:55.260 --> 09:44:57.162
LATER IN THE FALL. AND THAT'S

09:44:57.228 --> 09:44:58.897
WHEN HE LEARNED THAT I HAD

09:44:58.963 --> 09:44:59.931
ALREADY HAD TWO INFORMATIONAL

09:44:59.998 --> 09:45:01.366
HEARINGS OUT OF THIS, THAT I'VE

09:45:01.433 --> 09:45:02.233
DONE THE DUE THE DUE DILIGENCE

09:45:02.300 --> 09:45:03.935
TO NOT JUST INTRODUCE SOMETHING

09:45:04.002 --> 09:45:06.137
TO ACTUALLY DO THE BACK END WORK

09:45:06.204 --> 09:45:07.205
BEFORE I CAME HERE. SO THAT WAS

09:45:07.272 --> 09:45:10.408
MY ASK. I WILL CONTINUE EVEN TWO

09:45:10.475 --> 09:45:12.811
DAYS AGO OR A DAY AGO. I THINK

09:45:12.877 --> 09:45:14.746
EVEN THIS MORNING WE REACHED OUT

09:45:14.813 --> 09:45:15.680
TO OPPOSITION AND SAID, HEY, WE

09:45:15.747 --> 09:45:17.182
TOOK THESE AMENDMENTS. DOES THIS

09:45:17.248 --> 09:45:18.483
HELP WITH YOUR MEMBERS? THEY

09:45:18.550 --> 09:45:20.351
SAID, NO, NOTHING. NO, THERE'S

09:45:20.418 --> 09:45:23.621
NO COLLABORATION. THERE'S NO

09:45:23.688 --> 09:45:25.190
AMENDMENTS BEING PROPOSED. I

09:45:25.256 --> 09:45:27.058
WILL LOOK AT ANY AMENDMENT. I

09:45:27.125 --> 09:45:28.493
TOOK ALL THE AMENDMENTS THAT

09:45:28.560 --> 09:45:30.195
WERE PROPOSED FROM THIS

09:45:30.261 --> 09:45:30.829
COMMITTEE. EVERY AMENDMENT THAT

09:45:30.895 --> 09:45:32.063
A COLLEAGUE HAS PROPOSED TO ME,

09:45:32.130 --> 09:45:33.631
I HAVE TAKEN IT BECAUSE THAT'S

09:45:33.698 --> 09:45:35.633
THE ONLY THOSE ARE THE ONLY

09:45:35.700 --> 09:45:37.268
PEOPLE PROVIDING AMENDMENTS TO

09:45:37.335 --> 09:45:39.204
ME. SO I AM COMMITTED. IF

09:45:39.270 --> 09:45:40.238
PROBATION HAS AMENDMENTS THEY

09:45:40.305 --> 09:45:41.940
WANT TO SEND ME THAT I CAN

09:45:42.006 --> 09:45:43.508
REVIEW, I WILL. I'VE ALREADY

09:45:43.575 --> 09:45:44.442
COMMITTED THAT I HAVE OTHER

09:45:44.509 --> 09:45:45.977
AMENDMENTS READY TO GO TO

09:45:46.044 --> 09:45:47.245
ADDRESS THE COURTS, AND I

09:45:47.312 --> 09:45:48.413
ALREADY HAVE OTHER AMENDMENTS

09:45:48.480 --> 09:45:50.014
READY TO GO TO CHANGE THIS TO

09:45:50.081 --> 09:45:51.416
SPECIFICALLY, SAY, LA COUNTY,

09:45:51.483 --> 09:45:52.650
BECAUSE SOME COUNTIES WERE

09:45:52.717 --> 09:45:54.285
WORRIED THAT THEY MIGHT GROW TO

09:45:54.352 --> 09:45:57.622
6 MILLION PEOPLE. THAT'S THAT'S

09:45:57.689 --> 09:45:59.023
THEIR I DON'T THINK THEY WILL.

09:45:59.090 --> 09:46:00.725
BUT JUST IN CASE WE'LL MAKE SURE

09:46:00.792 --> 09:46:02.927
IT'S LA COUNTY. SO I HAVE I WILL

09:46:02.994 --> 09:46:04.329
CONTINUE TO MAKE THAT

09:46:04.395 --> 09:46:06.164
COMMITMENT. AND WITH THAT

09:46:06.231 --> 09:46:07.999
COMMITMENT AND IT GOES TO THE

09:46:08.066 --> 09:46:09.467
ASSEMBLY FLOOR. CORRECT. IT

09:46:09.534 --> 09:46:11.336
WOULD GO TO THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR.

09:46:11.402 --> 09:46:12.370
AND THEN THE SENATOR HAS

09:46:12.437 --> 09:46:13.872
COMMITTED TO MOVING IT TO THE

09:46:13.938 --> 09:46:15.206
INACTIVE FILE. AND THE SPEAKER'S

09:46:15.273 --> 09:46:16.374
OFFICE IS TRACKING AND WILL

09:46:16.441 --> 09:46:17.375
ENFORCE THAT COMMITMENT.

09:46:17.442 --> 09:46:18.376
CORRECT. BUT MY CONCERN IS THAT

09:46:18.443 --> 09:46:20.979
IF IT GOES TO THE FLOOR, THAT

09:46:21.045 --> 09:46:22.013
NOTHING WILL CHANGE. AND IF IT

09:46:22.080 --> 09:46:23.681
GETS TO THE FLOOR, THEN I'M NOT

09:46:23.748 --> 09:46:25.984
GOING TO VOTE FOR IT. THAT'S MY

09:46:26.050 --> 09:46:27.352
CONCERN. SO I WANT TO KNOW THAT

09:46:27.418 --> 09:46:29.053
THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME SORT OF

09:46:29.120 --> 09:46:31.055
AN AGREEMENT HERE AND NOW, MR.

09:46:31.122 --> 09:46:32.090
BYRD, THAT YOU AND MISS MENGIBAR

09:46:32.156 --> 09:46:33.691
WILL COMMIT TO WORKING TOGETHER.

09:46:33.758 --> 09:46:35.026
I'LL NOMINATE SCHULTZ TO BE

09:46:35.093 --> 09:46:35.860
THERE. AND YOU GUYS CAN FIGURE

09:46:35.927 --> 09:46:37.595
AGAIN, HOW MANY GRENADES DO I

09:46:37.662 --> 09:46:39.297
HAVE TO TAKE? MR. GONZALEZ, I

09:46:39.364 --> 09:46:41.733
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I IF I,

09:46:41.799 --> 09:46:44.736
IF I MAY CHAIR. YES, I WILL SAY

09:46:44.802 --> 09:46:47.605
THIS. WE ARE ALWAYS IN

09:46:47.672 --> 09:46:49.007
COLLABORATION WITH TRYING TO DO

09:46:49.073 --> 09:46:51.175
THINGS THAT HELP PROBATION. IT

09:46:51.242 --> 09:46:55.847
IS DIFFICULT. HONORABLE SIMPLY

09:46:55.914 --> 09:46:59.217
TO THINK THAT AN ENTITY OTHER

09:46:59.284 --> 09:47:01.219
THAN PROBATION SHOULD BE THE

09:47:01.286 --> 09:47:03.421
LEAD. WHEN THE STATE HAS

09:47:03.488 --> 09:47:04.889
MANDATED THAT IT'S PROBATION.

09:47:04.956 --> 09:47:06.758
AND SO WHAT I WILL SAY ABOUT

09:47:06.824 --> 09:47:10.295
THAT IS WE ARE WE WILL GO BACK

09:47:10.361 --> 09:47:13.531
AGAIN AND TRY TO FIND

09:47:13.598 --> 09:47:15.667
AMENDMENTS. BUT I'M MORE

09:47:15.733 --> 09:47:18.836
CONCERNED BECAUSE THIS IS PUBLIC

09:47:18.903 --> 09:47:20.838
SAFETY. THIS IS A PUBLIC SAFETY

09:47:20.905 --> 09:47:23.975
COMMITTEE. AND I SPOKE ABOUT

09:47:24.042 --> 09:47:28.012
CLARITY, AND I'M NOT CLEAR AS TO

09:47:28.079 --> 09:47:30.848
WHAT THE BILL IS GOING TO

09:47:30.915 --> 09:47:33.017
ACCOMPLISH THROUGH AN ENTITY

09:47:33.084 --> 09:47:35.019
THAT HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE LESS

09:47:35.086 --> 09:47:37.622
THAN THREE YEARS VERSUS AN

09:47:37.689 --> 09:47:40.858
ENTITY THAT HAS MADE MANY

09:47:40.925 --> 09:47:44.429
REFORMATIONS SINCE 1903. AND

09:47:44.495 --> 09:47:46.564
STILL PEOPLE HAVE DEDICATED

09:47:46.631 --> 09:47:50.568
THEIR LIVES FOR REFORMATION. WE

09:47:50.635 --> 09:47:52.403
DON'T CONTROL THE THINGS THAT

09:47:52.470 --> 09:47:55.740
THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS DOES,

09:47:55.807 --> 09:47:58.509
BUT WE ARE HERE TO WORK TO

09:47:58.576 --> 09:48:01.012
ENHANCE THE PROGRAM. I THINK

09:48:01.079 --> 09:48:03.581
FROM MY PERSONAL OPINION AND THE

09:48:03.648 --> 09:48:05.650
PEOPLE THAT I REPRESENT AND THE

09:48:05.717 --> 09:48:07.151
PEOPLE YOU KNOW, I'VE LIVED IN

09:48:07.218 --> 09:48:08.720
THREE DIFFERENT DISTRICTS IN LOS

09:48:08.786 --> 09:48:10.421
ANGELES COUNTY AND EVEN IN

09:48:10.488 --> 09:48:14.292
LAKEVIEW TERRACE. SO I THINK IF

09:48:14.359 --> 09:48:17.562
WE WOULD CONCENTRATE AND MAKE

09:48:17.629 --> 09:48:18.997
PROBATION, THE ENTITY THAT NEEDS

09:48:19.063 --> 09:48:21.899
THE REFORM, ALL THE THINGS THAT

09:48:21.966 --> 09:48:24.469
ARE ASKED FOR IN THE BILL,

09:48:24.535 --> 09:48:25.903
EXCEPT GIVING AWAY SOME OF THE

09:48:25.970 --> 09:48:27.472
RIGHTS IN TERMS OF ACCESSING

09:48:27.538 --> 09:48:28.272
RECORDS, WHICH WE THINK WILL

09:48:28.339 --> 09:48:30.508
CAUSE HARM, COULD BE ADDRESSED

09:48:30.575 --> 09:48:32.443
AS LONG AS YOU'RE ADDRESSING IT

09:48:32.510 --> 09:48:34.145
IN PROBATION. BUT IF THE AUTHOR

09:48:34.212 --> 09:48:36.180
WANTS TO MAINTAIN THAT, THEY

09:48:36.247 --> 09:48:38.383
BELIEVE THAT SOME OF OUR WORK,

09:48:38.449 --> 09:48:39.884
WHICH WE'VE ALREADY GIVEN,

09:48:39.951 --> 09:48:41.586
SHOULD BE GIVEN TO ANOTHER

09:48:41.653 --> 09:48:43.187
ENTITY, WE WILL TRY TO AMEND

09:48:43.254 --> 09:48:44.389
THAT. BUT THAT'S DIFFICULT. AND

09:48:44.455 --> 09:48:46.090
WE MADE THAT KNOWN. IT'S NOT

09:48:46.157 --> 09:48:47.525
THAT WE HAVEN'T TALKED IN GOOD

09:48:47.592 --> 09:48:49.193
FAITH. WE'VE MADE IT KNOWN WHY

09:48:49.260 --> 09:48:51.796
CERTAIN AMENDMENTS DOESN'T FIX

09:48:51.863 --> 09:48:53.965
THE BILL. IT'S HARD FINDING IT.

09:48:54.032 --> 09:48:57.035
EVEN THE AMENDMENTS YOU MADE AND

09:48:57.101 --> 09:48:59.337
PRESENTED THAT WE GOT LAST NIGHT

09:48:59.404 --> 09:49:03.141
THERE MISLEADING. IF YOU PUT IT

09:49:03.207 --> 09:49:05.443
TOWARD THE EMPHASIS OF THE BILL,

09:49:05.510 --> 09:49:06.844
THEY'RE NOT MISLEADING THAT YOU

09:49:06.911 --> 09:49:08.746
WORK TOGETHER ON THEM AND WE

09:49:08.813 --> 09:49:10.248
APPRECIATE THEM COMING UP WITH

09:49:10.314 --> 09:49:11.883
IT. BUT I THINK IT WASN'T CLEAR

09:49:11.949 --> 09:49:15.153
IN THE BILL WHAT NEEDED TO BE

09:49:15.219 --> 09:49:15.887
AMENDED RATHER THAN THE

09:49:15.953 --> 09:49:18.756
AMENDMENTS THAT WERE MADE. MR.

09:49:18.823 --> 09:49:20.825
GONZALEZ, YOU STILL HAVE THE

09:49:20.892 --> 09:49:21.959
FLOOR. I WILL JUST NOTE ASSEMBLY

09:49:22.026 --> 09:49:23.327
MEMBER NGUYEN HAS BEEN WANTING

09:49:23.394 --> 09:49:24.328
TO CHIME IN. YOU CAN CONTINUE IF

09:49:24.395 --> 09:49:27.298
YOU'RE DONE. FOR NOW, I CAN GO

09:49:27.365 --> 09:49:27.899
BACK OVER TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER

09:49:27.965 --> 09:49:30.368
NGUYEN AND GIVE YOU THE FLOOR

09:49:30.435 --> 09:49:32.003
BACK. I'M JUST TRYING TO GET

09:49:32.070 --> 09:49:33.905
CLARITY ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT.

09:49:33.971 --> 09:49:35.740
WILL YOU BE WILLING TO WORK WITH

09:49:35.807 --> 09:49:37.809
THE OFFICER? AND I KNOW THAT YOU

09:49:37.875 --> 09:49:39.243
DON'T LIKE THE DEPARTMENT, BUT

09:49:39.310 --> 09:49:40.945
OTHER WAYS TO CHANGE IT AND

09:49:41.012 --> 09:49:43.648
ADDRESS FOR THE ISSUES THAT THE

09:49:43.715 --> 09:49:44.282
MEMBER IS ADDRESSING. THERE ARE

09:49:44.348 --> 09:49:45.183
ISSUES THERE. WE CANNOT DENY

09:49:45.249 --> 09:49:46.718
THAT THOSE ARE FACTS. BUT WHAT

09:49:46.784 --> 09:49:49.220
CAN YOU DO TO GET TO A SPOT

09:49:49.287 --> 09:49:50.722
WHERE YOU AND THE SENATOR CAN

09:49:50.788 --> 09:49:52.557
MEND THIS? BECAUSE IF BOTH OF

09:49:52.623 --> 09:49:55.126
YOU CARE ABOUT THE YOUTH

09:49:55.193 --> 09:49:56.027
DEPARTMENT AND UNION JOBS AND

09:49:56.094 --> 09:49:58.362
ALL OF THOSE PIECES THAT MAKE

09:49:58.429 --> 09:49:59.764
THIS UP, THE ONLY WAY THAT THIS

09:49:59.831 --> 09:50:01.933
IS GOING TO FUNCTION IS IF YOU

09:50:01.999 --> 09:50:03.101
TWO CAN WORK TOGETHER. AND I

09:50:03.167 --> 09:50:04.202
JUST NEED THAT COMMITMENT FROM

09:50:04.268 --> 09:50:06.137
YOU ON THAT ONE. WE WILL COMMIT

09:50:06.204 --> 09:50:08.039
TO THAT. AND AGAIN, I WILL SAY

09:50:08.106 --> 09:50:10.675
TO THE COMMITTEE, YOU HAVE TO

09:50:10.742 --> 09:50:14.412
HAVE SOME REASONABLE OBJECTIVE

09:50:14.479 --> 09:50:16.647
RESULTS IN THE BILL THAT YOU

09:50:16.714 --> 09:50:19.217
WANT TO ACHIEVE. THEY ARE

09:50:19.283 --> 09:50:20.518
SUBJECTIVE AND THEREFORE YOU

09:50:20.585 --> 09:50:22.787
HAVE A PROBLEM WHEN THEY'RE

09:50:22.854 --> 09:50:24.322
SUBJECTIVE TO THE TO THE WAY

09:50:24.388 --> 09:50:26.791
IT'S WRITTEN. ALL RIGHT. MR.

09:50:26.858 --> 09:50:29.293
GONZALEZ, THANK YOU FOR YOUR

09:50:29.360 --> 09:50:30.094
LINE OF QUESTIONING. YES, I WILL

09:50:30.161 --> 09:50:31.763
TAKE THIS ASSIGNMENT AS WELL.

09:50:31.829 --> 09:50:33.231
WE'LL ALL MEET, PREFERABLY

09:50:33.297 --> 09:50:34.332
SOMEWHERE WARM AND COMFORTABLE

09:50:34.398 --> 09:50:35.366
LIKE PALM SPRINGS, AND WE'LL

09:50:35.433 --> 09:50:37.835
HASH IT OUT. VERY GOOD. I HEARD

09:50:37.902 --> 09:50:39.604
COMMITMENTS FROM BOTH ASSEMBLY

09:50:39.670 --> 09:50:41.472
MEMBER NGUYEN, PLEASE. I'M JUST

09:50:41.539 --> 09:50:43.674
GOING BACK TO THE SENATOR SAYING

09:50:43.741 --> 09:50:46.177
SHE'S WORKED ON THIS. SHE'S DONE

09:50:46.244 --> 09:50:48.346
AUTHOR AMENDMENTS AND SAID SHE'S

09:50:48.412 --> 09:50:49.781
GOT NO AMENDMENTS FROM YOU, AND

09:50:49.847 --> 09:50:51.282
YOU MIGHT HAVE ALREADY ANSWERED

09:50:51.349 --> 09:50:54.685
IT IN THE RESPONSE WITH

09:50:54.752 --> 09:50:55.920
ASSEMBLYMEMBER GONZALEZ, BUT WAS

09:50:55.987 --> 09:50:58.823
WONDERING WHY THERE HAS BEEN NO

09:50:58.890 --> 09:51:00.958
AMENDMENTS SENT TO THE SENATOR

09:51:01.025 --> 09:51:05.263
ON THIS. YOU WAS ASKING WHY NO

09:51:05.329 --> 09:51:07.398
AMENDMENTS WERE SENT? BECAUSE

09:51:07.465 --> 09:51:09.667
THE BILL I'M SORRY TO BE

09:51:09.734 --> 09:51:11.102
REDUNDANT TO A DEGREE. THAT'S

09:51:11.169 --> 09:51:13.204
WHY I SAID THE BILL WAS THE BILL

09:51:13.271 --> 09:51:16.073
IS NOT CLEAR ON ITS OBJECTIVES.

09:51:16.140 --> 09:51:18.910
THE BILL DOES NOT PRESENT

09:51:18.976 --> 09:51:21.078
ANYTHING THAT SHOWS THAT IT WILL

09:51:21.145 --> 09:51:22.847
HAVE THE RESULTS. FOR INSTANCE,

09:51:22.914 --> 09:51:24.282
THEY TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF

09:51:24.348 --> 09:51:26.384
THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED OVER

09:51:26.450 --> 09:51:27.185
THE YEARS. I WILL TELL YOU, IN

09:51:27.251 --> 09:51:29.887
THE LAST TWO WEEKS, THERE WAS A

09:51:29.954 --> 09:51:32.123
CBO THAT CAME FROM THE OUTSIDE

09:51:32.190 --> 09:51:33.324
TO WORK IN PROBATION, THAT GOT

09:51:33.391 --> 09:51:35.092
ARRESTED FOR BRINGING IN DRUGS.

09:51:35.159 --> 09:51:36.994
SO EVEN THOUGH YOU COULD BLAME

09:51:37.061 --> 09:51:39.163
OR POINT THE FINGER AT

09:51:39.230 --> 09:51:40.231
PROBATION, RIGHT, YOU COULD ALSO

09:51:40.298 --> 09:51:41.933
SEE THAT THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT

09:51:41.999 --> 09:51:43.835
THOSE THAT ARE UNTRAINED, LIKE

09:51:43.901 --> 09:51:46.037
WE ARE, HAVE THE SAME CAPABILITY

09:51:46.103 --> 09:51:48.072
OF MAKING THE SAME MISTAKES AT A

09:51:48.139 --> 09:51:53.211
HIGHER LEVEL. AND SO WE WANT THE

09:51:53.277 --> 09:51:55.980
AUTHOR TO WORK WITH PROBATION.

09:51:56.047 --> 09:51:58.482
AND SO WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY

09:51:58.549 --> 09:52:00.017
AMENDMENTS THAT WE COULD SEE

09:52:00.084 --> 09:52:02.153
THAT WOULD FIT THE WAY IT WAS

09:52:02.220 --> 09:52:04.622
PRESENTED. BUT WE WILL GO BACK

09:52:04.689 --> 09:52:06.791
AND WORK WITH THE AUTHOR. SO,

09:52:06.858 --> 09:52:08.326
MR. CHAIR, I'M SORRY I KEEP

09:52:08.392 --> 09:52:09.927
BRINGING THIS UP AGAIN BECAUSE

09:52:09.994 --> 09:52:11.629
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THERE IS A

09:52:11.696 --> 09:52:13.030
LOT OF DISCUSSION THAT NEEDS TO

09:52:13.097 --> 09:52:15.099
HAPPEN, AND IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S

09:52:15.166 --> 09:52:15.666
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AT THE

09:52:15.733 --> 09:52:17.268
TABLE. BUT I'M WONDERING, IT

09:52:17.335 --> 09:52:19.070
SOUNDS LIKE THERE MIGHT BE SOME

09:52:19.136 --> 09:52:19.637
POLICY CHANGES THAT HAPPEN

09:52:19.704 --> 09:52:20.905
THROUGH THIS DISCUSSION. SO THEN

09:52:20.972 --> 09:52:22.773
WOULD THIS THEN COME BACK TO US

09:52:22.840 --> 09:52:24.342
OR IT WOULD JUST GO STRAIGHT TO

09:52:24.408 --> 09:52:26.477
THE FLOOR IF IT MAKES IT OUT OF

09:52:26.544 --> 09:52:27.411
COMMITTEE TODAY, I'M JUST TRYING

09:52:27.478 --> 09:52:29.981
TO DECIDE ON WHETHER OR NOT WE

09:52:30.047 --> 09:52:31.282
SHOULD KEEP IT IN COMMITTEE SO

09:52:31.349 --> 09:52:32.884
THAT THE CONVERSATION CAN BE

09:52:32.950 --> 09:52:33.818
HAD, AND THEN WE BRING IT BACK

09:52:33.885 --> 09:52:35.753
SO THAT WE'RE A PART OF THIS

09:52:35.820 --> 09:52:38.122
DISCUSSION AND A PART OF MOVING

09:52:38.189 --> 09:52:38.923
THIS TO THE FLOOR. AGAIN, I GO

09:52:38.990 --> 09:52:41.292
BACK TO I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE

09:52:41.359 --> 09:52:42.393
IN MOVING THIS OUT AND THEN

09:52:42.460 --> 09:52:43.060
PUTTING THIS ALL ON OUR

09:52:43.127 --> 09:52:44.428
COLLEAGUES ON THE FLOOR. WHEN WE

09:52:44.495 --> 09:52:46.063
ARE A PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE,

09:52:46.130 --> 09:52:47.198
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO VET THESE

09:52:47.265 --> 09:52:50.134
THINGS OUT. AND IF WE'RE TAKING

09:52:50.201 --> 09:52:51.903
THIS OUT AND IT GOES TO THE

09:52:51.969 --> 09:52:53.905
FLOOR AND THEY HAVE THEIR

09:52:53.971 --> 09:52:55.473
DISCUSSIONS AND BIG CHANGES THEY

09:52:55.539 --> 09:52:57.108
HAVE, I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A

09:52:57.174 --> 09:52:59.110
POLICY CHANGE. IT WOULD COME

09:52:59.176 --> 09:53:00.745
BACK FOR US TO VOTE AND THEN IT

09:53:00.811 --> 09:53:03.347
GOES TO THE FLOOR. I'M JUST NOT

09:53:03.414 --> 09:53:03.981
QUITE SURE HOW THAT HAPPENS,

09:53:04.048 --> 09:53:05.950
WHICH IS WHY I THINK THE VOTE

09:53:06.017 --> 09:53:07.685
WOULD BE TO JUST HOLD IT HERE SO

09:53:07.752 --> 09:53:09.020
THAT BOTH SIDES CAN KIND OF

09:53:09.086 --> 09:53:10.354
FIGURE THIS OUT AND THEN BRING

09:53:10.421 --> 09:53:13.224
IT BACK AGAIN FOR US TO DISCUSS.

09:53:13.291 --> 09:53:13.791
WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

09:53:13.858 --> 09:53:14.358
ASSEMBLY MEMBER NGUYEN ALL

09:53:14.425 --> 09:53:16.060
CONSTRUE THAT AS A QUESTION TO

09:53:16.127 --> 09:53:18.329
THE CHAIR. I AM BY NO MEANS

09:53:18.396 --> 09:53:19.130
FORCING SENATOR MENGIBAR TO MOVE

09:53:19.196 --> 09:53:21.299
THIS OUT OF COMMITTEE AND GO TO

09:53:21.365 --> 09:53:23.034
THE FLOOR. SHE'S WELCOME TO KEEP

09:53:23.100 --> 09:53:24.101
IT PARKED HERE. HOWEVER, I HAVE

09:53:24.168 --> 09:53:25.069
HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS WITH

09:53:25.136 --> 09:53:26.203
THE SENATOR, AND I UNDERSTAND

09:53:26.270 --> 09:53:28.906
THE DESIRE TO MOVE IT OUT OF

09:53:28.973 --> 09:53:30.174
COMMITTEE TO ENSURE THAT THIS IS

09:53:30.241 --> 09:53:31.175
NOT AN ISSUE THAT IS NOT SPOKEN

09:53:31.242 --> 09:53:33.544
ABOUT, NOT REVISITED. AGAIN, SHE

09:53:33.611 --> 09:53:34.879
HAS TAKEN COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS,

09:53:34.946 --> 09:53:36.080
AND I WILL SAY THAT SHE HAS

09:53:36.147 --> 09:53:37.748
TAKEN EVERY SINGLE AMENDMENT,

09:53:37.815 --> 09:53:39.216
BEEN VERY COLLABORATIVE WITH OUR

09:53:39.283 --> 09:53:41.485
OFFICE IN TERMS OF PROCESS AND

09:53:41.552 --> 09:53:44.355
PROCEDURE. THIS IS JUST MY

09:53:44.422 --> 09:53:46.123
$0.02. IT SOUNDS AS IF THE

09:53:46.190 --> 09:53:47.658
SPONSOR OF THE BILL EVEN HAS

09:53:47.725 --> 09:53:49.060
SOME CONCERNS ABOUT ITS CURRENT

09:53:49.126 --> 09:53:50.194
ITERATION. OBVIOUSLY, THE

09:53:50.261 --> 09:53:51.862
SENATOR HAS ALL OF HER OPTIONS

09:53:51.929 --> 09:53:52.997
AVAILABLE TO HER IN JANUARY. IF

09:53:53.064 --> 09:53:55.633
SHE DOESN'T FEEL THAT THE

09:53:55.700 --> 09:53:56.267
CURRENT BILL IS SUFFICIENT, SHE

09:53:56.334 --> 09:53:57.401
COULD SIMPLY KEEP IT IN THE

09:53:57.468 --> 09:53:58.536
INACTIVE FILE AND NOT ADVANCE

09:53:58.602 --> 09:54:00.237
IT. IF SHE WANTS TO MAKE A

09:54:00.304 --> 09:54:02.373
CHANGE THAT MORE SATISFIES THE

09:54:02.440 --> 09:54:03.507
SPONSOR, THE COMMITTEE COULD

09:54:03.574 --> 09:54:06.377
PULL THAT BACK IN. IF SHE

09:54:06.444 --> 09:54:08.112
REACHES AN AGREEMENT WITH THE

09:54:08.179 --> 09:54:09.447
OPPOSITION TO CHANGE AGAIN

09:54:09.513 --> 09:54:11.182
SUBSTANTIALLY. WE CAN ROPE THAT

09:54:11.248 --> 09:54:13.584
BACK IN MY COMMITMENT TO BOTH

09:54:13.651 --> 09:54:15.519
SIDES, ALL SIDES IN THIS IS THAT

09:54:15.586 --> 09:54:16.787
WHETHER IT'S IN COMMITTEE OR

09:54:16.854 --> 09:54:19.623
NOT, I AND MY TEAM, WHO YOU SEE

09:54:19.690 --> 09:54:21.792
UP HERE AT THE DAIS, WE REMAIN

09:54:21.859 --> 09:54:22.893
COMMITTED TO BEING A RESOURCE

09:54:22.960 --> 09:54:24.328
FOR ALL OF YOU, TO THE EXTENT

09:54:24.395 --> 09:54:25.730
THAT WE CAN BROKER THOSE

09:54:25.796 --> 09:54:26.931
CONVERSATIONS, WE ARE MORE THAN

09:54:26.998 --> 09:54:29.467
HAPPY TO DO THAT. AT THE END OF

09:54:29.533 --> 09:54:30.101
THE DAY, I'M EXTENDING A

09:54:30.167 --> 09:54:31.602
COURTESY TO A COLLEAGUE WHO I

09:54:31.669 --> 09:54:33.137
DEEPLY RESPECT. I'M HAPPY TO GO

09:54:33.204 --> 09:54:34.071
EITHER WAY, AND IF THE

09:54:34.138 --> 09:54:35.806
PREFERENCE IS TO MOVE IT OUT OF

09:54:35.873 --> 09:54:36.941
COMMITTEE UNDERSTANDING, THEY'LL

09:54:37.008 --> 09:54:38.109
STILL BE WORK TO DO. I'M

09:54:38.175 --> 09:54:39.777
PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE WITH THAT

09:54:39.844 --> 09:54:41.946
ARRANGEMENT. I'D LIKE TO MOVE

09:54:42.013 --> 09:54:43.347
FORWARD WITH THE DEAL THAT I'VE

09:54:43.414 --> 09:54:45.416
MADE WITH THE MEMBERS, TO BE

09:54:45.483 --> 09:54:47.284
ABLE TO GET IT OUT OF COMMITTEE.

09:54:47.351 --> 09:54:48.919
PERFECT. I WAS JUST MORE SAYING

09:54:48.986 --> 09:54:49.520
THAT FOR THEATRICAL PURPOSES,

09:54:49.587 --> 09:54:52.623
BUT. SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE I.

09:54:52.690 --> 09:54:53.824
YES, I'M VERY COMFORTABLE WITH

09:54:53.891 --> 09:54:56.027
THE ARRANGEMENT, SENATOR. I JUST

09:54:56.093 --> 09:54:57.828
FELT WE NEEDED A MOMENT OF

09:54:57.895 --> 09:54:59.163
LEVITY THERE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

09:54:59.230 --> 09:55:00.831
NGUYEN, YOU STILL HAVE THE

09:55:00.898 --> 09:55:01.766
FLOOR. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS,

09:55:01.832 --> 09:55:03.968
COMMENTS? COFFEE ORDERS? THINK

09:55:04.035 --> 09:55:06.570
STARBUCKS MIGHT STILL BE OPEN?

09:55:06.637 --> 09:55:07.571
WELL, WE DON'T EVEN HAVE A

09:55:07.638 --> 09:55:09.040
MOTION. ACTUALLY, WE DO HAVE A

09:55:09.106 --> 09:55:10.841
MOTION. I'M SORRY. WE HAVE A WE

09:55:10.908 --> 09:55:13.911
NEED A SECOND. IS THERE A SECOND

09:55:13.978 --> 09:55:16.847
I OKAY, MR. HANEY, WE HAVE A

09:55:16.914 --> 09:55:19.617
SECOND. THEN WITH THAT, SENATOR

09:55:19.683 --> 09:55:20.184
MENGIBAR, YOU'RE WELCOME TO

09:55:20.251 --> 09:55:25.056
CLOSE IF YOU'D LIKE. OKAY. I DO

09:55:25.122 --> 09:55:28.526
APPRECIATE THE TIME THAT WAS

09:55:28.592 --> 09:55:31.295
SPENT BY EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU

09:55:31.362 --> 09:55:31.929
ON THIS, BECAUSE IT ALLOWED THE

09:55:31.996 --> 09:55:34.432
DISCUSSION TO COME TO LIGHT.

09:55:34.498 --> 09:55:37.501
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS DON'T FORCE

09:55:37.568 --> 09:55:39.970
ANYBODY TO RAPE, LEAD FIGHT

09:55:40.037 --> 09:55:42.139
CLUBS, OR CALL OUT AND NOT

09:55:42.206 --> 09:55:44.608
REPORT TO WORK. THAT IS BY THE

09:55:44.675 --> 09:55:46.844
INDIVIDUAL. AND RIGHT NOW, AS WE

09:55:46.911 --> 09:55:48.612
WERE TALKING RIGHT NOW, I GOT A

09:55:48.679 --> 09:55:51.415
PING THAT A KID RIGHT NOW JUST

09:55:51.482 --> 09:55:53.651
OD'D FROM LOS PADRINOS IN L.A.

09:55:53.717 --> 09:55:56.887
COUNTY. AGAIN SURVIVED. BUT ON

09:55:56.954 --> 09:55:58.355
THE WAY TO THE HOSPITAL AS WE

09:55:58.422 --> 09:56:00.291
WERE TALKING, ANOTHER INCIDENT

09:56:00.357 --> 09:56:02.860
IN L.A. COUNTY BECAUSE LIKE LA

09:56:02.927 --> 09:56:04.795
TIMES WILL SHOW THAT ON ONE

09:56:04.862 --> 09:56:07.298
NIGHT WHEN A YOUTH ESCAPED, 100

09:56:07.364 --> 09:56:08.999
PROBATION OFFICERS WERE

09:56:09.066 --> 09:56:10.868
SCHEDULED TO WORK, BUT 60 CALLED

09:56:10.935 --> 09:56:14.538
OUT. ON ANOTHER DAY, 103

09:56:14.605 --> 09:56:15.506
PROBATION OFFICERS CALLED OUT.

09:56:15.573 --> 09:56:18.476
THE NEXT DAY, 101 OFFICERS

09:56:18.542 --> 09:56:20.945
CALLED OUT. YOU HEARD FOR THE

09:56:21.011 --> 09:56:21.579
OPPOSITION. THEY'RE STRUGGLING

09:56:21.645 --> 09:56:23.481
WITH STAFFING. THEY ARE

09:56:23.547 --> 09:56:24.882
STRUGGLING WITH STAFFING. THEY

09:56:24.949 --> 09:56:27.485
NEED SUPPORT. THE SUPPORT IS

09:56:27.551 --> 09:56:28.919
WITH THE COUNTY HAVING THE

09:56:28.986 --> 09:56:31.388
ABILITY TO BRING IN ADDITIONAL

09:56:31.455 --> 09:56:32.790
ENTITIES THAT PROBATION CANNOT

09:56:32.857 --> 09:56:36.760
DENY ENTRY TO. I HAVE A MILITARY

09:56:36.827 --> 09:56:38.062
BACKGROUND. I HAVE APPLIED TO BE

09:56:38.129 --> 09:56:39.530
A LAW ENFORCEMENT IN ANOTHER

09:56:39.597 --> 09:56:41.365
WORLD. I WOULD HAVE BEEN A COP.

09:56:41.432 --> 09:56:43.267
I HAVE HIGH ESTEEM FOR ANYBODY

09:56:43.334 --> 09:56:45.469
WHO WEARS A UNIFORM. THIS IS NOT

09:56:45.536 --> 09:56:47.671
THE AUTHOR THAT IS COMING IN TO

09:56:47.738 --> 09:56:49.507
SAY, I DON'T WANT COPS PROBATION

09:56:49.573 --> 09:56:51.208
OFFICERS TO EXIST IN THESE

09:56:51.275 --> 09:56:53.010
ROLES. I THINK THEY HAVE TO

09:56:53.077 --> 09:56:54.578
EXIST IN THESE ROLES. BUT I'M

09:56:54.645 --> 09:56:55.980
ALSO A SOCIAL WORKER AND THAT IS

09:56:56.046 --> 09:56:58.048
MY ACADEMIC BACKGROUND. I

09:56:58.115 --> 09:56:59.483
RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN

09:56:59.550 --> 09:57:02.019
INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE A BETTER

09:57:02.086 --> 09:57:03.387
POSITION TO BRING SOCIAL

09:57:03.454 --> 09:57:05.556
SERVICES TO OUR YOUTH IN

09:57:05.623 --> 09:57:06.790
CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN MOVING

09:57:06.857 --> 09:57:09.960
TOWARDS A MODEL TO BE MORE

09:57:10.027 --> 09:57:12.029
REHABILITATIVE OF BOTH OUR YOUTH

09:57:12.096 --> 09:57:13.931
AND OUR ADULTS AND OUR

09:57:13.998 --> 09:57:15.699
INCARCERATED SYSTEM. THIS BILL

09:57:15.766 --> 09:57:17.501
DOES NOT SHORTEN THE TIME

09:57:17.568 --> 09:57:19.603
ALLOTTED FOR KIDS TO BE IN

09:57:19.670 --> 09:57:20.838
JUVENILE HALLS. THIS BILL DOES

09:57:20.905 --> 09:57:23.340
NOT SAY THAT WE NEED TO RELEASE

09:57:23.407 --> 09:57:24.341
INDIVIDUALS OUT INTO THE

09:57:24.408 --> 09:57:25.843
COMMUNITY. IT DOES NOT SAY THAT

09:57:25.910 --> 09:57:27.912
THESE KIDS ARE STILL GOING TO BE

09:57:27.978 --> 09:57:29.813
ABLE TO SERVE THEIR TIME IN

09:57:29.880 --> 09:57:30.948
JUVENILE HALLS. IT JUST SAYS

09:57:31.015 --> 09:57:31.982
THAT SERVICES ARE GOING TO

09:57:32.049 --> 09:57:33.417
HAPPEN BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE

09:57:33.484 --> 09:57:35.186
ADDITIONAL SUPPORT BY A

09:57:35.252 --> 09:57:37.655
DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT. I AM

09:57:37.721 --> 09:57:39.557
COMMITTED TO STILL WORKING WITH

09:57:39.623 --> 09:57:41.625
THE OPPOSITION. BUT TO SENATOR

09:57:41.692 --> 09:57:43.661
WYNN'S POINT, I HAVE HERE

09:57:43.727 --> 09:57:45.262
VERBATIM AN EMAIL FROM THE

09:57:45.329 --> 09:57:46.330
OPPOSITION THAT SAYS ON BEHALF

09:57:46.397 --> 09:57:48.032
OF THE COALITION OF LA PROBATION

09:57:48.098 --> 09:57:50.234
UNIONS, WE BELIEVE THAT NO

09:57:50.301 --> 09:57:52.169
AMENDMENT CAN FIX A BILL THAT IS

09:57:52.236 --> 09:57:53.204
FUNDAMENTALLY DESIGNED TO

09:57:53.270 --> 09:57:55.005
DISMANTLE A UNION WORKFORCE. THE

09:57:55.072 --> 09:57:56.907
AMENDMENTS I TOOK FROM COMMITTEE

09:57:56.974 --> 09:57:59.276
DOUBLE DOWN AND SAY THAT NO

09:57:59.343 --> 09:58:01.345
UNION JOBS WILL BE LOST, AND

09:58:01.412 --> 09:58:03.681
WHATEVER JOB IS CREATED HERE HAS

09:58:03.747 --> 09:58:06.116
TO GO TO A UNION. SO I'VE BEEN

09:58:06.183 --> 09:58:07.585
TRYING AND I WILL CONTINUE TO

09:58:07.651 --> 09:58:09.320
COMMIT TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION,

09:58:09.386 --> 09:58:11.088
BUT I'M JUST POINTING THAT OUT

09:58:11.155 --> 09:58:14.325
THAT NO, IT'S I'M JUST POINTING

09:58:14.391 --> 09:58:17.561
THAT OUT. COMMITTEE MEMBERS, I

09:58:17.628 --> 09:58:21.265
KNOW IT'S NOT IDEAL WHAT WHAT

09:58:21.332 --> 09:58:24.068
WE'RE DOING HERE TO PARKING IN

09:58:24.134 --> 09:58:26.303
THE ON THE FLOOR. BUT I NEED

09:58:26.370 --> 09:58:27.571
SOME LEVERAGE AND I'M SHOWING

09:58:27.638 --> 09:58:29.073
ALL MY CARDS HERE. YOU HAVE ALL

09:58:29.139 --> 09:58:31.575
MY CARDS HERE THAT I NEED SOME

09:58:31.642 --> 09:58:32.710
LEVERAGE TO ALLOW L'APPROBATION

09:58:32.776 --> 09:58:33.877
TO TAKE US SERIOUSLY. THAT'S

09:58:33.944 --> 09:58:35.246
SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN

09:58:35.312 --> 09:58:36.380
AND SOMETHING NEEDS TO CHANGE

09:58:36.447 --> 09:58:38.148
WITH YOUR SUPPORT, AS THIS ONLY

09:58:38.215 --> 09:58:40.384
APPLIES TO L.A. COUNTY, L.A.

09:58:40.451 --> 09:58:42.486
COUNTY ONLY. I NEED YOUR SUPPORT

09:58:42.553 --> 09:58:44.154
TO GET THAT TO THE FLOOR TO

09:58:44.221 --> 09:58:45.189
CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS

09:58:45.256 --> 09:58:46.490
WITH THAT, MR. CHAIR, ASKING

09:58:46.557 --> 09:58:48.926
RESPECTFULLY FOR AN AYE VOTE.

09:58:48.993 --> 09:58:52.196
THANK YOU. SENATOR, I HAVE A

09:58:52.263 --> 09:58:53.998
BRIEF, RELATIVELY BRIEF

09:58:54.064 --> 09:58:55.332
RECOMMENDATION. COLLEAGUES, I AM

09:58:55.399 --> 09:58:56.634
RECOMMENDING AN AYE. AND I'M

09:58:56.700 --> 09:58:57.935
GOING TO START WITH THE

09:58:58.002 --> 09:58:59.436
PROCEDURAL POINT HERE. PART OF

09:58:59.503 --> 09:59:01.905
WHY I SUPPORT SENATOR MENGIBAR

09:59:01.972 --> 09:59:03.274
MOVING IT OUT OF COMMITTEE INTO

09:59:03.340 --> 09:59:05.175
THE FLOOR IS QUITE SIMPLY THE

09:59:05.242 --> 09:59:06.243
TIMING. IF SENATOR WERE TO HOLD

09:59:06.310 --> 09:59:08.879
IT AS A TWO YEAR BILL IN THIS

09:59:08.946 --> 09:59:09.913
COMMITTEE, AS YOU ALL KNOW, SHE

09:59:09.980 --> 09:59:11.682
WOULD ONLY HAVE UNTIL JANUARY TO

09:59:11.749 --> 09:59:13.817
TRY TO WORK OUT ALL OF THESE

09:59:13.884 --> 09:59:14.885
LOGISTICS WITH THE OPPOSITION.

09:59:14.952 --> 09:59:16.020
MOVING IT TO THE FLOOR GIVES HER

09:59:16.086 --> 09:59:18.022
ALL OF NEXT YEAR AND ALL OF NEXT

09:59:18.088 --> 09:59:19.156
SESSION TO HOPEFULLY HAVE A

09:59:19.223 --> 09:59:20.391
CHANCE TO CONTINUE THIS THIS

09:59:20.457 --> 09:59:21.492
CONVERSATION. AND I HOPE AND

09:59:21.558 --> 09:59:23.127
BELIEVE THAT THERE IS COMMON

09:59:23.193 --> 09:59:25.062
GROUND TO BE FOUND HERE. I MIGHT

09:59:25.129 --> 09:59:26.096
BE NAIVE, BUT I GENUINELY DO. I

09:59:26.163 --> 09:59:27.731
AM BETTING ON SENATOR MENGIBAR,

09:59:27.798 --> 09:59:29.033
AND I'M AFFORDING HER THE TIME

09:59:29.099 --> 09:59:31.402
THAT I BELIEVE THAT SHE NEEDS TO

09:59:31.468 --> 09:59:32.069
HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AND FIND

09:59:32.136 --> 09:59:33.971
COMMON GROUND. IF YOU AGREE WITH

09:59:34.038 --> 09:59:35.172
THAT, I WOULD STRONGLY ENCOURAGE

09:59:35.239 --> 09:59:37.107
YOU TO VOTE AYE. AND THE LAST

09:59:37.174 --> 09:59:39.710
THING I WILL MENTION IS THIS I

09:59:39.777 --> 09:59:41.378
UNDERSTAND, I GENUINELY DO. I

09:59:41.445 --> 09:59:42.980
UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO AN

09:59:43.047 --> 09:59:44.581
EXTENT WITH MANY OF THE CONCERNS

09:59:44.648 --> 09:59:46.283
RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION. I WILL

09:59:46.350 --> 09:59:48.385
SIMPLY CLOSE WITH NOTING THAT

09:59:48.452 --> 09:59:50.587
THE GENTLEMAN, MR. BYRD, WHO WAS

09:59:50.654 --> 09:59:51.655
SITTING THERE IN THE CHAIR, I

09:59:51.722 --> 09:59:53.757
THINK HE'S NOW BACK OVER THERE.

09:59:53.824 --> 09:59:54.358
THERE WAS A GOOD POINT ABOUT

09:59:54.425 --> 09:59:55.893
WHAT IS THIS BILL TRYING TO

09:59:55.959 --> 09:59:58.329
SOLVE MY HUMBLE PERSPECTIVE AS

09:59:58.395 --> 10:00:00.164
CHAIR. IT STARTS RIGHT HERE ON

10:00:00.230 --> 10:00:01.965
PAGE THREE OF THE COMMITTEE

10:00:02.032 --> 10:00:03.901
ANALYSIS FROM PAGES THREE

10:00:03.967 --> 10:00:05.936
THROUGH FIVE, THERE IS A SUMMARY

10:00:06.003 --> 10:00:07.738
THAT DOCUMENTS THE HORROR STORY

10:00:07.805 --> 10:00:09.206
THAT IS LOS ANGELES COUNTY

10:00:09.273 --> 10:00:10.641
PROBATION. AND I DON'T SAY THAT

10:00:10.708 --> 10:00:11.709
POINTING FINGERS. I'M NOT SAYING

10:00:11.775 --> 10:00:12.876
IT'S THE PROBATION OFFICER'S

10:00:12.943 --> 10:00:14.178
FAULT. I'M NOT SAYING IT'S THE

10:00:14.244 --> 10:00:15.679
IT'S THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS

10:00:15.746 --> 10:00:17.247
FAULT. THE POINT IS, IS THAT'S

10:00:17.314 --> 10:00:19.683
NOT FOR ME TO SAY, BUT THAT IS

10:00:19.750 --> 10:00:20.851
THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

10:00:20.918 --> 10:00:22.486
SOLVE. SENATOR MENGIBAR HAS HER

10:00:22.553 --> 10:00:23.654
PROPOSAL. I CHALLENGE THE

10:00:23.721 --> 10:00:25.422
OPPOSITION. I CHALLENGE SENATOR

10:00:25.489 --> 10:00:26.757
MENGIBAR. I CHALLENGE ALL OF US

10:00:26.824 --> 10:00:28.392
TO THINK OF A BETTER PROPOSAL.

10:00:28.459 --> 10:00:30.828
AND I'M WILLING TO BET ON

10:00:30.894 --> 10:00:31.562
SENATOR SENATOR MENGIBAR AND

10:00:31.628 --> 10:00:33.597
GIVE HER TIME TO GET THIS DONE.

10:00:33.664 --> 10:00:35.032
RIGHT. BECAUSE THE DEFINITION OF

10:00:35.099 --> 10:00:36.900
INSANITY IS DOING THE SAME THING

10:00:36.967 --> 10:00:39.269
YOU HAVE BEEN DOING, AND NOTHING

10:00:39.336 --> 10:00:40.104
EVER CHANGES. WE'RE LOSING LIVES

10:00:40.170 --> 10:00:41.972
IN LA COUNTY AND WE HAVE GOT TO

10:00:42.039 --> 10:00:44.241
DO BETTER. SO I'M WILLING TO TRY

10:00:44.308 --> 10:00:45.542
SOMETHING NEW. WITH THAT SAID,

10:00:45.609 --> 10:00:47.544
THE RECOMMENDATION IS AN AYE. WE

10:00:47.611 --> 10:00:50.447
HAVE A MOTION. WE HAVE A SECOND.

10:00:50.514 --> 10:00:51.982
LET'S CALL THE ROLL ON SB 357 BY

NGUYEN. NGUYEN. NOT VOTING.

10:01:06.430 --> 10:01:11.235

WE'RE NOT TAKING ANY ACTION ON

10:01:43.267 --> 10:01:45.002
THE BILL TODAY, BUT WE WILL BE

10:01:45.068 --> 10:01:47.037
MAKING IT A TWO YEAR BILL. AND I

10:01:47.104 --> 10:01:49.039
WOULD LIKE TO EVIDENCE MY INTENT

10:01:49.106 --> 10:01:51.041

ENERGY IS A LITTLE LOW. BUT

THANK YOU, THANK YOU. I KNOW

10:02:32.282 --> 10:02:33.984

ADVOCATE. AS I SHARED MANY TIMES

HOW IMPORTANT ADVOCACY FOR

VICTIMS IS. I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW

10:02:49.967 --> 10:02:51.602
IT IS CRITICAL TO SAFEGUARD

10:02:51.668 --> 10:02:54.104
THESE SPACES WHERE OUR VICTIMS

10:02:54.171 --> 10:02:57.040
GO. AND I WANT TO JUST SHARE

10:02:57.107 --> 10:02:57.908
THAT AREAS LIKE DOMESTIC

PEOPLE JUST ARE HAVING A HARD

10:03:14.391 --> 10:03:15.726
TIME SEEKING HELP BECAUSE THEY

10:03:15.792 --> 10:03:17.327
ARE AFRAID. AND SO THIS BILL

10:03:17.394 --> 10:03:19.796
JUST SIMPLY SAYS THAT WE WANT TO

10:03:19.863 --> 10:03:22.466
GO BACK TO A TIME WHERE WE USED

10:03:22.533 --> 10:03:24.635
TO HAVE PEOPLE PRESENT

10:03:35.245 --> 10:03:37.714
OUR VICTIMS TO FEEL SAFE, TO GO

10:03:37.781 --> 10:03:40.117
GET HELP. AND IN THE INTEREST OF

10:03:40.183 --> 10:03:42.052

VIOLENCE THAT THEY'VE BEEN

10:04:04.675 --> 10:04:06.076
REFERRED TO US BY RAPE CRISIS

10:04:06.143 --> 10:04:08.812
CENTER STAFF SINCE JANUARY 2025,

10:04:08.879 --> 10:04:10.414
WE HAVE SEEN A DECLINE IN

10:04:10.480 --> 10:04:11.915
SURVIVORS SHOWING UP TO ACCESS

10:04:11.982 --> 10:04:13.517

JUSTICE CENTERS AND OTHER

10:04:20.557 --> 10:04:22.225
PROGRAMS. DUE TO FEAR OF

10:04:22.292 --> 10:04:23.226
INCREASED IMMIGRATION

10:04:23.293 --> 10:04:24.428
ENFORCEMENT PRESENCE ACROSS THE

10:04:24.494 --> 10:04:26.930
STATE. SB 841, AUTHORED BY

10:04:26.997 --> 10:04:28.432
SENATOR RUBIO, WORKS TO ADDRESS

10:04:28.498 --> 10:04:30.334
THIS BY REQUIRING EMPLOYEES AT

10:04:30.400 --> 10:04:32.736
THESE CENTERS TO REFUSE ACCESS

10:04:32.803 --> 10:04:33.870
TO NONPUBLIC AREAS FOR

10:04:33.937 --> 10:04:35.238
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT

10:04:35.305 --> 10:04:36.807
ACTIVITY. WE KNOW THE MAJORITY

10:04:36.873 --> 10:04:38.809
OF SURVIVORS DON'T REACH OUT FOR

10:04:38.875 --> 10:04:40.444
HELP, AND THE RECENT POLITICAL

10:04:40.510 --> 10:04:42.079
CLIMATE HAS FURTHER SILENCED

10:04:42.145 --> 10:04:44.281
MANY IMMIGRANT AND UNDOCUMENTED

10:04:44.348 --> 10:04:45.682
SURVIVORS, LEAVING THEM WITHOUT

10:04:45.749 --> 10:04:47.117
ACCESS TO HEALING, SUPPORTIVE

10:04:47.184 --> 10:04:49.353
AND SAFE SERVICES. LAST MONTH,

10:04:49.419 --> 10:04:51.088
WE SAW IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT

10:04:51.154 --> 10:04:53.223
SWEEP LOS ANGELES, GRABBING

10:04:53.290 --> 10:04:54.658
INDIVIDUALS OFF THE STEPS OF

10:04:54.725 --> 10:04:56.493
COURTHOUSES AND PULLING FAMILIES

10:04:56.560 --> 10:04:58.028
APART. ONE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

10:04:58.095 --> 10:04:59.396
PROGRAM IN LA SHARED THAT A

10:04:59.463 --> 10:05:00.864
SURVIVOR THEY HAD BEEN WORKING

10:05:00.931 --> 10:05:02.232
WITH FOR SEVERAL MONTHS DID NOT

10:05:02.299 --> 10:05:03.900
APPEAR FOR HER RESTRAINING ORDER

10:05:03.967 --> 10:05:05.302
HEARING OUT OF FEAR OF INCREASED

10:05:05.369 --> 10:05:08.071
ICE PRESENCE. OTHER ADVOCATES IN

10:05:08.138 --> 10:05:09.106
RIVERSIDE COUNTY WHO WORK WITH

10:05:09.172 --> 10:05:11.041
RURAL FARM WORKER SURVIVORS

10:05:11.108 --> 10:05:12.676
SHARED THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE

10:05:12.743 --> 10:05:13.877
INCREASINGLY UNWILLING TO MEET

10:05:13.944 --> 10:05:15.879
AT THEIR PROGRAMS AND LIBRARIES,

10:05:15.946 --> 10:05:17.881
OR EVEN THE LOCAL FAMILY JUSTICE

10:05:17.948 --> 10:05:18.849
CENTER, TO TALK THROUGH

10:05:18.915 --> 10:05:20.717
RESOURCES AND SUPPORT. MANY ARE

10:05:20.784 --> 10:05:22.386
NOT EVEN LEAVING THEIR HOMES OUT

10:05:22.452 --> 10:05:24.187
OF FEAR. FOR MANY SURVIVORS,

10:05:24.254 --> 10:05:25.555
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT ACTS AS

10:05:25.622 --> 10:05:27.891
A SECOND ABUSER, SILENCING THEM

10:05:27.958 --> 10:05:29.626
AND KEEPING THEM IN HARM'S WAY.

10:05:29.693 --> 10:05:31.495
AT A TIME WHEN SURVIVORS OF

10:05:31.561 --> 10:05:33.096
CRIME NEED ACCESS TO SERVICES

10:05:33.163 --> 10:05:34.765
THE MOST, OUR PROGRAMS ARE

10:05:34.831 --> 10:05:36.033
SEEING LESS FOLKS WALK THROUGH

10:05:36.099 --> 10:05:38.468
THEIR DOORS. SB 841 ENSURES THAT

10:05:38.535 --> 10:05:40.871
THESE PROGRAMS CAN CREATE SAFE

10:05:40.937 --> 10:05:42.172
ENVIRONMENTS TO FOSTER HEALING

10:05:42.239 --> 10:05:44.341
AND SAFETY. SURVIVORS WILL NOT

10:05:44.408 --> 10:05:46.143
HAVE TO FEAR THAT IMMIGRATION

10:05:46.209 --> 10:05:48.011
AUTHORITIES AND UNLAWFUL WILL

10:05:48.078 --> 10:05:50.080
UNLAWFULLY ENTER FACILITIES, AND

10:05:50.147 --> 10:05:51.214
STAFF WILL KNOW THAT THEY CAN

10:05:51.281 --> 10:05:53.483
CONTINUE DOING WHAT THEY DO

10:05:53.550 --> 10:05:56.586
BEST. SUPPORTING SURVIVORS. I

10:05:56.653 --> 10:05:57.954
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

10:05:58.021 --> 10:05:59.890
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. GOOD

10:05:59.956 --> 10:06:01.358
EVENING. THANK YOU FOR THE

10:06:01.425 --> 10:06:02.025
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE TODAY

10:06:02.092 --> 10:06:04.461
IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB 841. MY

10:06:04.528 --> 10:06:06.396
NAME IS PERLA FLORES, AND I'VE

10:06:06.463 --> 10:06:07.431
HAD THE PRIVILEGE AND HONOR TO

10:06:07.497 --> 10:06:08.832
WORK WITH IMMIGRANT SURVIVORS OF

10:06:08.899 --> 10:06:09.499
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, SEXUAL

10:06:09.566 --> 10:06:11.435
ASSAULT, AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING

10:06:11.501 --> 10:06:13.603
FOR OVER 20 YEARS. CURRENTLY, I

10:06:13.670 --> 10:06:15.072
OVERSEE SERVICES FOR GENDER

10:06:15.138 --> 10:06:17.074
BASED VIOLENCE SURVIVORS AT

10:06:17.140 --> 10:06:18.141
COMMUNITY SOLUTIONS, A

10:06:18.208 --> 10:06:19.643
COMPREHENSIVE NONPROFIT THAT

10:06:19.710 --> 10:06:20.777
SERVES SANTA CLARA AND SAN

10:06:20.844 --> 10:06:22.779
BENITO COUNTY. IN ADDITION TO MY

10:06:22.846 --> 10:06:24.448
OWN PROGRAM LEADERSHIP, I'M ALSO

10:06:24.514 --> 10:06:26.183
AN IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY AND

10:06:26.249 --> 10:06:27.250
REPRESENTED MANY SURVIVORS OF

10:06:27.317 --> 10:06:28.885
GENDER BASED VIOLENCE AND

10:06:28.952 --> 10:06:30.387
INDIVIDUALS PURSUING IMMIGRATION

10:06:30.454 --> 10:06:32.622
RELIEF. AND LASTLY, I'M A PROUD

10:06:32.689 --> 10:06:33.990
IMMIGRANT AND ALSO A SURVIVOR OF

10:06:34.057 --> 10:06:36.359
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. I WANT TO

10:06:36.426 --> 10:06:37.694
FOCUS MY TESTIMONY ON THREE

10:06:37.761 --> 10:06:39.596
CRITICAL POINTS ONE, THE NEED TO

10:06:39.663 --> 10:06:40.864
PROTECT SURVIVORS AND THEIR

10:06:40.931 --> 10:06:42.399
CHILDREN AS THEY RECEIVE

10:06:42.466 --> 10:06:44.134
SERVICES TWO THE DEVASTATING

10:06:44.201 --> 10:06:45.402
IMPACT OF CHRONIC FEAR AND

10:06:45.469 --> 10:06:47.037
STRESS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

10:06:47.104 --> 10:06:48.872
CONSTANT THREAT OF IMMIGRATION

10:06:48.939 --> 10:06:50.307
ENFORCEMENT, AND THREE, THE

10:06:50.373 --> 10:06:51.508
EROSION OF DUE PROCESS FOR MOST

10:06:51.575 --> 10:06:53.844
OF OUR VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES.

10:06:53.910 --> 10:06:55.245
FIRSTLY, SHELTERS, CRISIS

10:06:55.312 --> 10:06:56.780
CENTERS AND OTHER SAFE SPACES

10:06:56.847 --> 10:06:58.915
ARE OFTEN THE ONLY LIFELINE

10:06:58.982 --> 10:07:00.383
AVAILABLE FOR SURVIVORS FLEEING

10:07:00.450 --> 10:07:02.185
VIOLENCE. THESE ARE PLACES WHERE

10:07:02.252 --> 10:07:04.221
SURVIVORS BEGIN TO HEAL, REGAIN

10:07:04.287 --> 10:07:05.689
STABILITY, AND ACCESS VITAL

10:07:05.756 --> 10:07:06.823
SUPPORTS FOR THEMSELVES AND

10:07:06.890 --> 10:07:08.625
THEIR CHILDREN. WHEN THESE

10:07:08.692 --> 10:07:10.060
SPACES ARE NO LONGER CONSIDERED

10:07:10.127 --> 10:07:11.895
SAFE. WHEN THE LOOMING THREAT OF

10:07:11.962 --> 10:07:12.963
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT BECOMES

10:07:13.029 --> 10:07:15.265
PART OF THE EQUATION, SURVIVORS

10:07:15.332 --> 10:07:17.901
MAY HAVE TO CHOOSE TO STAY IN

10:07:17.968 --> 10:07:19.136
DANGEROUS SITUATIONS RATHER THAN

10:07:19.202 --> 10:07:20.937
RISKS SEEKING HELP DUE TO THE

10:07:21.004 --> 10:07:24.141
FEAR THAT IF THEY DO LEAVE THE

10:07:24.207 --> 10:07:25.509
SITUATION ABUSIVE OR

10:07:25.575 --> 10:07:26.676
EXPLOITATIVE, THEY COULD BE

10:07:26.743 --> 10:07:27.577
SEPARATED FROM THEIR FAMILIES,

10:07:27.644 --> 10:07:29.112
FROM THEIR CHILDREN, OR EVEN

10:07:29.179 --> 10:07:30.881
FROM THEIR SUPPORT NETWORKS. AND

10:07:30.947 --> 10:07:32.682
THIS IS A CHOICE THAT NOBODY

10:07:32.749 --> 10:07:34.851
SHOULD HAVE TO MAKE. SECOND, THE

10:07:34.918 --> 10:07:36.386
CHRONIC STRESS AND FEAR CAUSED

10:07:36.453 --> 10:07:38.121
BY POTENTIAL IMMIGRATION

10:07:38.188 --> 10:07:39.923
ENFORCEMENT IN OR NEAR SERVICE

10:07:39.990 --> 10:07:41.391
LOCATIONS CAN HAVE SEVERE LONG

10:07:41.458 --> 10:07:43.226
TERM IMPACTS ON SURVIVORS AND

10:07:43.293 --> 10:07:44.561
THEIR CHILDREN. LIVING IN

10:07:44.628 --> 10:07:45.729
CONSTANT FEAR NOT ONLY

10:07:45.796 --> 10:07:47.164
UNDERMINES SURVIVORS ABILITY TO

10:07:47.230 --> 10:07:48.865
RECOVER EMOTIONALLY, BUT IT ALSO

10:07:48.932 --> 10:07:50.267
AFFECTS THEIR PHYSICAL HEALTH,

10:07:50.333 --> 10:07:52.269
THEIR PARENTING CAPACITY, AND

10:07:52.335 --> 10:07:53.570
CHILDREN'S DEVELOPMENT. WE'VE

10:07:53.637 --> 10:07:55.071
SEEN CHILDREN WHOSE TRAUMA IS

10:07:55.138 --> 10:07:56.039
COMPOUNDED BY WATCHING THEIR

10:07:56.106 --> 10:07:57.874
PARENTS LIVE IN FEAR, TERRIFIED

10:07:57.941 --> 10:07:59.709
THAT A KNOCK AT THE DOOR COULD

10:07:59.776 --> 10:08:01.144
MEAN SEPARATION OR DETENTION.

10:08:01.211 --> 10:08:02.612
THESE FAMILIES ARE ALREADY

10:08:02.679 --> 10:08:04.514
COPING WITH COMPLEX TRAUMA, AND

10:08:04.581 --> 10:08:05.849
ADDING THE FEAR OF IMMIGRATION

10:08:05.916 --> 10:08:07.017
ENFORCEMENT ONLY MAKES HEALING

10:08:07.083 --> 10:08:09.052
HARDER AND IN SOME CASES,

10:08:09.119 --> 10:08:10.854
IMPOSSIBLE. AND LASTLY, WE CAN'T

10:08:10.921 --> 10:08:12.689
IGNORE THE EROSION OF DUE

10:08:12.756 --> 10:08:14.124
PROCESS THAT OCCURS WHEN

10:08:14.191 --> 10:08:14.891
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT TAKES

10:08:14.958 --> 10:08:16.226
PLACE IN THESE SPACES. WITHOUT

10:08:16.293 --> 10:08:19.563
PROPER JUDICIAL OVERSIGHT. SB

10:08:19.629 --> 10:08:20.530
841 DOES NOT PREVENT LAW

10:08:20.597 --> 10:08:21.698
ENFORCEMENT FROM DOING THEIR

10:08:21.765 --> 10:08:23.500
JOB. IT SIMPLY ENSURES THE BASIC

10:08:23.567 --> 10:08:25.335
LEGAL STANDARDS ARE MET. IT

10:08:25.402 --> 10:08:26.970
REQUIRES A JUDICIAL WARRANT AND

10:08:27.037 --> 10:08:28.605
CLEAR DOCUMENTATION BEFORE

10:08:28.672 --> 10:08:30.640
ACCESS TO NONPUBLIC AREAS IS

10:08:30.707 --> 10:08:33.043
GRANTED AND CONCLUSION. SB 841

10:08:33.109 --> 10:08:34.678
IS NOT ABOUT POLITICS, IT'S

10:08:34.744 --> 10:08:36.079
ABOUT PEOPLE. IT'S ABOUT

10:08:36.146 --> 10:08:37.247
CHILDREN SLEEPING THROUGH THE

10:08:37.314 --> 10:08:39.015
NIGHT WITHOUT FEAR, ABOUT

10:08:39.082 --> 10:08:40.016
SURVIVORS STEPPING INTO A

10:08:40.083 --> 10:08:41.218
SHELTER AND KNOWING THAT THEY

10:08:41.284 --> 10:08:42.686
WILL NOT BE RETRAUMATIZED BY THE

10:08:42.752 --> 10:08:44.454
THREAT OF DEPORTATION. IT'S

10:08:44.521 --> 10:08:45.755
ABOUT RESTORING TRUST IN THE

10:08:45.822 --> 10:08:46.923
SYSTEMS THAT ARE MEANT TO

10:08:46.990 --> 10:08:48.859
SUPPORT AND PROTECT. I URGE YOU

10:08:48.925 --> 10:08:50.594
TO SUPPORT SB 841 AND ENSURE

10:08:50.660 --> 10:08:51.962
THAT EVERY SURVIVOR OF GENDER

10:08:52.028 --> 10:08:53.730
BASED VIOLENCE, REGARDLESS OF

10:08:53.797 --> 10:08:55.131
IMMIGRATION STATUS, HAS A TRUE

10:08:55.198 --> 10:08:56.566
OPPORTUNITY TO FIND SAFETY,

10:08:56.633 --> 10:08:59.035
SECURITY AND HOPE. THANK YOU.

10:08:59.102 --> 10:09:00.670
THANK YOU, SENATOR, FOR THE

10:09:00.737 --> 10:09:01.471
PRESENTATION AND FOR YOUR

10:09:01.538 --> 10:09:03.073
PATIENCE WITH THE LAST MATTER.

10:09:03.139 --> 10:09:04.341
AND THANK YOU BOTH FOR STICKING

EDUCATIONAL MOMENT FOR ME. IT'S

10:10:38.134 --> 10:10:39.836
JUST KEEP IN MIND THAT

10:10:39.903 --> 10:10:40.971

10:10:41.037 --> 10:10:43.373

GENERAL AND TO HAVE TO DECIDE TO

10:10:47.510 --> 10:10:48.878
TAKE A BEATING BECAUSE YOU'RE

10:10:48.945 --> 10:10:50.947
AFRAID TO GO TO ONE OF THESE

10:10:51.014 --> 10:10:52.148
SHELTERS IS UNCONSCIONABLE. AND

10:10:52.215 --> 10:10:53.950
I THINK THAT WE NEED TO DO

10:10:54.017 --> 10:10:55.318
BETTER. AND I WILL JUST ADD

10:10:55.385 --> 10:10:56.419
ANYBODY THAT DOESN'T SUPPORT THE

10:10:56.486 --> 10:10:57.887
BILL. YOU'RE REALLY STANDING

10:10:57.954 --> 10:11:01.091
WITH THOSE ABUSERS, RAPISTS AND

10:11:01.157 --> 10:11:02.158
PERPETRATORS. BECAUSE IF A

10:11:02.225 --> 10:11:04.327
VICTIM DOESN'T COME FORWARD

10:11:04.394 --> 10:11:06.496
BECAUSE OF FEAR, NUMBER ONE, WE

10:11:06.563 --> 10:11:08.331
FAILED THEM AS A SOCIETY. BUT

10:11:08.398 --> 10:11:12.002

10:11:17.007 --> 10:11:18.808
SENATOR. I DO RECOMMEND DENY. I

10:11:18.875 --> 10:11:20.844
THINK IT'S SOUND POLICY. IF YOU

10:11:20.910 --> 10:11:22.512
NEED A COAUTHOR IN THE ASSEMBLY

10:11:22.579 --> 10:11:23.713
OR IF THERE'S ROOM FOR ANOTHER

10:11:23.780 --> 10:11:26.116
ONE, I WOULD BE HAPPY TO JUMP

10:11:26.182 --> 10:11:27.617
ON. I THINK IT'S A RIGHTEOUS

10:11:27.684 --> 10:11:28.818
CAUSE. AND THANK YOU FOR

10:11:28.885 --> 10:11:30.086

MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS, FOR

10:12:40.190 --> 10:12:41.891

SAFETY AND JUSTICE. I'LL TURN IT

10:12:59.609 --> 10:13:03.113
OVER TO THEM TO PROVIDE

10:13:03.179 --> 10:13:04.280
TESTIMONY. I'M READING THIS ON

10:13:04.347 --> 10:13:07.150
BEHALF OF AINAN HARRIS. HE HAD

10:13:07.217 --> 10:13:09.119
TO CATCH A FLIGHT BACK HOME, BUT

10:13:09.185 --> 10:13:11.221
HE WAS HERE ALL DAY AND ALL

10:13:11.287 --> 10:13:13.156
THAT. HE WAS A FORMERLY

10:13:13.223 --> 10:13:14.023
INCARCERATED FIREFIGHTER, FOUGHT

10:13:14.090 --> 10:13:15.825
A LOT OF FIRES. AND SO I'M GOING

10:13:15.892 --> 10:13:18.294
TO READ ON. IN 2020, THE

10:13:18.361 --> 10:13:19.829
ASSEMBLY MEMBER, GÃMEZ REYES,

10:13:19.896 --> 10:13:22.832
LED THE PASSAGE OF AB 2147,

10:13:22.899 --> 10:13:24.634
WHICH CREATED A PROCESS ALLOWING

10:13:24.701 --> 10:13:26.302
FORMERLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE WHO

10:13:26.369 --> 10:13:29.105
HAVE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED FIRE

10:13:29.172 --> 10:13:31.608
CÂ¢M TO PETITION FOR RECORD

10:13:31.674 --> 10:13:34.077
EXPUNGEMENT. AB 2147 WAS AN

10:13:34.144 --> 10:13:36.246
IMPORTANT FIRST STEP, BUT IT

10:13:36.312 --> 10:13:37.947
HASN'T RESOLVED THE ISSUE.

10:13:38.014 --> 10:13:40.216
PETITIONS CAN TAKE MONTHS OR

10:13:40.283 --> 10:13:42.452
YEARS, AND THERE IS NO GUARANTEE

10:13:42.519 --> 10:13:45.321
OF AN EXPUNGEMENT. I MYSELF WAS

10:13:45.388 --> 10:13:48.224
A WILDLAND FIREFIGHTER FOR

10:13:48.291 --> 10:13:50.593
CUESTA CAMP CREW THREE. I WAS A

10:13:50.660 --> 10:13:53.530
SAWYER WHO RAN THE SECOND SAU

10:13:53.596 --> 10:13:55.298
FOR CREW THREE, AND I CAN TELL

10:13:55.365 --> 10:13:56.966
YOU THAT IT CHANGED MY LIFE. IT

10:13:57.033 --> 10:13:58.268
WAS THE HARDEST WORK I'VE EVER

10:13:58.334 --> 10:14:01.104
DONE IN MY LIFE AND AT THE SAME

10:14:01.171 --> 10:14:01.771
TIME, THE MOST FULFILLING WORK.

10:14:01.838 --> 10:14:03.673
ONCE WE PUT ASIDE THE FEAR AND

10:14:03.740 --> 10:14:05.475
THE ANGST AND MOVE AS A UNIT TO

10:14:05.542 --> 10:14:07.277
ACCOMPLISH OUR TASK OF LITERALLY

10:14:07.343 --> 10:14:09.179
FIGHTING FIRES WITH HAND TOOLS

10:14:09.245 --> 10:14:10.813
AND CHAINSAWS, THERE IS A SENSE

10:14:10.880 --> 10:14:13.049
OF PRIDE AND JOY THAT COMES OVER

10:14:13.116 --> 10:14:15.151
A CREW. SOMETHING HAPPENS WITHIN

10:14:15.218 --> 10:14:16.886
US, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE

10:14:16.953 --> 10:14:19.422
GRUELING TRAINING AND ALL NIGHT

10:14:19.489 --> 10:14:22.325
FIRE WATCHES WEREN'T SO BAD. WE

10:14:22.392 --> 10:14:24.227
YEARN TO BE OF SERVICE. WE TAKE

10:14:24.294 --> 10:14:25.862
PRIDE IN BEING PROTECTORS AND

10:14:25.929 --> 10:14:28.164
NOT DESTROYERS, AND WE DREAM OF

10:14:28.231 --> 10:14:30.433
BEING ABLE TO DO THIS FOR A

10:14:30.500 --> 10:14:32.468
LIVING IN A YELLOW CAL FIRE

10:14:32.535 --> 10:14:33.937
UNIFORM. THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS

10:14:34.003 --> 10:14:36.940
SO IMPORTANT. MANY JUDGES REMAIN

10:14:37.006 --> 10:14:38.474
UNINFORMED ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF

10:14:38.541 --> 10:14:41.010
THE LAW AND WHY IT WAS CREATED.

10:14:41.077 --> 10:14:42.478
WHILE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF

10:14:42.545 --> 10:14:43.913
COMPLETED EXPUNGEMENT IS

10:14:43.980 --> 10:14:46.449
UNKNOWN, IT IS ESTIMATED TO BE A

10:14:46.516 --> 10:14:47.183
VERY LOW FIGURE. GIVEN THE

10:14:47.250 --> 10:14:48.985
AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES FOR

10:14:49.052 --> 10:14:50.787
SOMEONE TO COMPLETE THE PROCESS

10:14:50.853 --> 10:14:53.356
WITHOUT AN EXPUNGEMENT. FORMERLY

10:14:53.423 --> 10:14:54.390
INCARCERATED HAND CREWS CAN'T

10:14:54.457 --> 10:14:57.927
PURSUE NECESSARY CREDENTIALS.

10:14:57.994 --> 10:14:59.662
CREDENTIAL CREDENTIALS, SUCH AS

10:14:59.729 --> 10:15:02.365
AN EMT CERTIFICATION, WHICH

10:15:02.432 --> 10:15:05.235
WHICH IS A PREREQUISITE FOR MOST

10:15:05.301 --> 10:15:07.237
FIREFIGHTER JOB POSITION. SENATE

10:15:07.303 --> 10:15:10.506
BILL TWO 4245 BUILDS ON AB 2147

10:15:10.573 --> 10:15:12.775
BY AUTOMATING THE EXISTING

10:15:12.842 --> 10:15:14.510
EXPUNGEMENT PROCESS, REMOVING

10:15:14.577 --> 10:15:16.179
THE REQUIREMENT FROM FOR THE

10:15:16.246 --> 10:15:18.214
INDIVIDUAL TO SUBMIT A PETITION,

10:15:18.281 --> 10:15:19.849
IT USES THE EXISTING CANNABIS

10:15:19.916 --> 10:15:21.284
EXPUNGEMENT PROCESS AS THE

10:15:21.351 --> 10:15:23.553
TEMPLATE. SENATE BILL 245 DOES

10:15:23.620 --> 10:15:25.555
NOT CHANGE WHO CAN GET AN

10:15:25.622 --> 10:15:27.490
EXPUNGEMENT. THE ELIGIBILITY

10:15:27.557 --> 10:15:29.726
RESTRICTIONS ENACTED UNDER AB

10:15:29.792 --> 10:15:32.528
2147 FOR CONVICTIONS SUCH AS

10:15:32.595 --> 10:15:34.364
ARSON OR MURDER ARE RETAINED

10:15:34.430 --> 10:15:36.966
UNDER SENATE BILL 245. THE MORE

10:15:37.033 --> 10:15:39.636
WE REMOVE BARRIERS TO REENTRY

10:15:39.702 --> 10:15:41.504
AND GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT POST

10:15:41.571 --> 10:15:43.172
RELIEF, THE MORE WE ARE ABLE TO

10:15:43.239 --> 10:15:44.841
LOWER RECIDIVISM RATES AND

10:15:44.907 --> 10:15:46.843
IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY FOR ALL

10:15:46.909 --> 10:15:48.077
CALIFORNIANS. AND HE'S BEEN

10:15:48.144 --> 10:15:49.879
WAITING THREE YEARS ON

10:15:49.946 --> 10:15:52.382
EXPUNGEMENT AND HE HASN'T GOT

10:15:52.448 --> 10:15:54.851
IT. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. GOOD

10:15:54.917 --> 10:15:56.386
EVENING, CHAIR AND MEMBERS. MY

JUSTICE AND PROUD CO-SPONSOR OF

10:16:03.559 --> 10:16:07.030
SB 245. THE DEVASTATION THE

CALIFORNIA IS WELL KNOWN TO

10:16:09.265 --> 10:16:11.134
