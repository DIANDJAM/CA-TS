00:33:05.516 --> 00:33:07.452

PLEASE SILENCE YOUR CELL PHONES

00:33:16.427 --> 00:33:17.862
IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY DONE SO.

00:33:17.929 --> 00:33:19.597
WE WILL NOT PERMIT. I WILL NOT

00:33:19.664 --> 00:33:21.032
PERMIT CONDUCT THAT DISRUPTS,

00:33:21.099 --> 00:33:22.100
DISTURBS, OR OTHERWISE IMPEDES

THE ORDERLY CONDUCT OF TODAY'S

GIVE ONE AND ONLY ONE WARNING.

00:33:26.637 --> 00:33:28.072
PLEASE BE AWARE THAT VIOLATION

00:33:28.139 --> 00:33:29.874
OF THESE RULES WILL SUBJECT YOU

00:33:29.941 --> 00:33:31.542
TO REMOVAL OR OTHER ENFORCEMENT

00:33:31.609 --> 00:33:33.678
ACTIONS. WE HAVE THE OFF

00:33:33.745 --> 00:33:36.080

TIME THAT DUE TO SCHEDULING

00:33:50.828 --> 00:33:52.930
ISSUES, WE ARE MAKING SPECIAL

00:33:52.997 --> 00:33:53.798
ACCOMMODATIONS BY ALLOWING

00:33:53.865 --> 00:33:55.133

MEASURE IS A RESOLUTION THAT WAS

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:10.882
ADDED TO OUR AGENDA YESTERDAY.

00:34:10.948 --> 00:34:12.550
AS ALWAYS, AUTHORS WILL HAVE

00:34:12.617 --> 00:34:14.619

00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:21.259
COMMITTEE STANDING PRACTICE.

00:34:21.325 --> 00:34:30.268
WELL. ONE MOMENT. SENATOR WAHAB,

CHAIRING SENATE PUBLIC SAFETY,

00:34:47.985 --> 00:34:50.588
TO GO FIRST. MR. VICE CHAIR IS

00:34:50.655 --> 00:34:52.623
JUST YOU. OH, AND MR. GONZALEZ

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:54.459
IS WITH US AS WELL. WE'LL START

00:34:54.525 --> 00:34:57.795
WITH SENATOR ARAGON. THIS IS.

00:34:57.862 --> 00:35:00.431
BEAR WITH ME. THIS THIS IS ITEM

00:35:00.498 --> 00:35:01.866
NUMBER 19. COLLEAGUES, SENATE

00:35:01.933 --> 00:35:05.703
BILL 705 704, ENTITLED FIREARMS,

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:07.672
FIREARM BARRELS. SENATOR ARAGON,

00:35:07.738 --> 00:35:08.973
THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU,

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.441
MISTER CHAIR. MEMBERS FOR THE

00:35:10.508 --> 00:35:11.909
OPPORTUNITY. PRESENT SB 704.

00:35:11.976 --> 00:35:13.377
FIRST, I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY

00:35:13.444 --> 00:35:14.178
ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE'S

00:35:14.245 --> 00:35:15.146
AMENDMENT, WHICH REDUCED THE

00:35:15.213 --> 00:35:16.447
CRIMINAL PENALTIES. UNDER THE

00:35:16.514 --> 00:35:18.716
BILL, SB 704 REQUIRES THAT THE

00:35:18.783 --> 00:35:20.551
PURCHASE OF A FIREARM BARREL

00:35:20.618 --> 00:35:22.220
FOLLOW A SIMILAR PROCESS AS TO

00:35:22.286 --> 00:35:23.287
WHEN SOMEONE PURCHASES A

00:35:23.354 --> 00:35:25.590
FIREARM. THAT IS, IT MUST BE

00:35:25.656 --> 00:35:26.190
CONDUCTED IN PERSON, THROUGH A

00:35:26.257 --> 00:35:27.692
LICENSED DEALER, AND WITH A

00:35:27.758 --> 00:35:28.392
BACKGROUND CHECK CONDUCTED ON

00:35:28.459 --> 00:35:30.628
THE PURCHASER. LET'S PUT THIS IN

00:35:30.695 --> 00:35:32.363
CONTEXT. IN 2019 TO 2021, THE

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:33.931
NUMBER OF GHOST GUNS RECOVERED

00:35:33.998 --> 00:35:35.166
FROM A CRIME IN CALIFORNIA

00:35:35.233 --> 00:35:39.070
INCREASED BY 592%. IN THIS

00:35:39.136 --> 00:35:40.404
INCREASE IN GHOST GUNS ACCOUNTED

00:35:40.471 --> 00:35:41.772
FOR NEARLY 70% OF THE TOTAL

00:35:41.839 --> 00:35:43.274
NUMBER OF CRIME GUNS RECOVERED

00:35:43.341 --> 00:35:46.077
IN CALIFORNIA DURING THIS PERIOD

00:35:46.143 --> 00:35:47.512
AND FOLLOWING THIS DATA IN 2022

00:35:47.578 --> 00:35:49.981
AND 2023, CALIFORNIA ENACTED

00:35:50.047 --> 00:35:51.449
LEADING LAWS TO COMBAT THE

00:35:51.516 --> 00:35:53.217
MANUFACTURING OF GUN OF GHOST

00:35:53.284 --> 00:35:54.719
GUNS. HOWEVER, THE FIGHT IN

00:35:54.785 --> 00:35:56.821
COMBATING UNREGULATED FIREARMS

00:35:56.888 --> 00:35:57.889
CONTINUES. THE GHOST GUN

00:35:57.955 --> 00:35:59.323
INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO SEEK OUT

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:01.826
NEW WAYS TO MARKET. SKIP THE

00:36:01.893 --> 00:36:03.461
BACKGROUND CHECK ACCESS TO

00:36:03.528 --> 00:36:05.029
UNTRACEABLE FIREARMS. CRIMINALS

00:36:05.096 --> 00:36:05.963
AND SEGMENTS OF THE FIREARM

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:07.532
INDUSTRY HAVE PIVOTED AWAY FROM

00:36:07.598 --> 00:36:09.100
TRADITIONAL GHOST GUN PARTS AND

00:36:09.166 --> 00:36:11.135
KITS TOWARDS 3D PRINTING, ONCE

00:36:11.202 --> 00:36:12.537
AGAIN CIRCUMVENTING STATE AND

00:36:12.603 --> 00:36:15.506
FEDERAL FIREARM REGULATIONS. AND

00:36:15.573 --> 00:36:17.441
SO WHY THIS IS RELEVANT IS THAT

00:36:17.508 --> 00:36:19.544
THE PURCHASING OF A BARREL IS AN

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:21.679
ESSENTIAL PIECE OF A GUN AND

00:36:21.746 --> 00:36:22.747
ESSENTIAL PIECE TO HELP

00:36:22.813 --> 00:36:24.649
MANUFACTURE A GHOST. GUN BARRELS

00:36:24.715 --> 00:36:25.983
ARE ENTIRELY UNREGULATED AND CAN

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:27.785
BE PURCHASED ONLINE OR IN A

00:36:27.852 --> 00:36:29.453
STORE WITHOUT A BACKGROUND CHECK

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.856
OR ANY RESTRICTION. SB 704 SEEKS

00:36:31.923 --> 00:36:32.990
TO CLOSE THIS LOOPHOLE THAT

00:36:33.057 --> 00:36:34.325
ALLOWS INDIVIDUALS TO ACQUIRE

00:36:34.392 --> 00:36:35.393
FIREARM BARRELS USING GHOST GUNS

00:36:35.459 --> 00:36:37.228
WITHOUT OVERSIGHT, IN ORDER TO

00:36:37.295 --> 00:36:38.663
CURB GUN VIOLENCE IN OUR

00:36:38.729 --> 00:36:40.398
COMMUNITIES, WE HAVE EXEMPTED

00:36:40.464 --> 00:36:42.133
LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE HAVE LOWERED

00:36:42.199 --> 00:36:43.768
PENALTIES. WE HAVE REALLY TAKEN

00:36:43.834 --> 00:36:44.769
INTO CONSIDERATION THE INPUT

00:36:44.835 --> 00:36:47.138
WE'VE HEARD FROM STAKEHOLDERS.

00:36:47.204 --> 00:36:48.806
THIS BILL DOES EXEMPT THE

00:36:48.873 --> 00:36:50.875
PROCESS FOR LAWFUL GUN OWNERS,

00:36:50.942 --> 00:36:51.509
INCLUDING INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE

00:36:51.576 --> 00:36:52.710
ALREADY GONE THROUGH A

00:36:52.777 --> 00:36:53.744
BACKGROUND CHECK BECAUSE THEY

00:36:53.811 --> 00:36:55.279
PURCHASED A FIREARM. IT EXEMPTS

00:36:55.346 --> 00:36:56.314
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES,

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:57.648
INCLUDING THE MILITARY, A

00:36:57.715 --> 00:36:59.550
FEDERALLY LICENSED COLLECTOR,

00:36:59.617 --> 00:37:00.551
AMONG OTHERS. WITH ME TO

00:37:00.618 --> 00:37:02.286
TESTIFY. STEVEN LINDLEY, SENIOR

00:37:02.353 --> 00:37:03.521
PROGRAM MANAGER AT THE BRADY

00:37:03.588 --> 00:37:05.957
CAMPAIGN, AND JONATHAN FELDMAN,

00:37:06.023 --> 00:37:06.524
REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA

00:37:06.591 --> 00:37:08.159
POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. THANK

00:37:08.225 --> 00:37:10.428
YOU, MR. CHAIR AND COMMITTEE

00:37:10.494 --> 00:37:11.596
MEMBERS. MY NAME IS STEVEN LEE.

00:37:11.662 --> 00:37:13.798
I'M A 28 YEAR LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:37:13.864 --> 00:37:14.699
VETERAN AND FORMER CHIEF OF THE

00:37:14.765 --> 00:37:15.766
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

00:37:15.833 --> 00:37:17.468
JUSTICE, BUREAU OF FIREARMS.

00:37:17.535 --> 00:37:19.236
OVER PROBABLY THE LAST 20 YEARS,

00:37:19.303 --> 00:37:21.772
WE'VE HAD A GHOST GUN ISSUE HERE

00:37:21.839 --> 00:37:24.041
IN CALIFORNIA, AND IT BECAME

00:37:24.108 --> 00:37:26.877
PROGRESSIVELY WORSE. IN 2016, WE

00:37:26.944 --> 00:37:29.714
TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO PASS

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:30.748
LEGISLATION IN ORDER TO CURB

00:37:30.815 --> 00:37:32.550
THIS PROBLEM. HOWEVER, THAT WAS

00:37:32.617 --> 00:37:34.085
VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR AT THE

00:37:34.151 --> 00:37:36.187
TIME, AND THAT TIDAL WAVE OF

00:37:36.253 --> 00:37:37.588
GHOST GUNS CAME FROM CALIFORNIA

00:37:37.655 --> 00:37:39.323
AND WASHED ACROSS OUR COUNTRY.

00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:41.392
AND WE'VE SEEN A RAPID INCREASE

00:37:41.459 --> 00:37:43.327
IN THE NUMBER OF FIREARM GHOST

00:37:43.394 --> 00:37:45.596
GUN FIREARMS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:37:45.663 --> 00:37:46.697
CONFISCATED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT,

00:37:46.764 --> 00:37:48.065
NOT ONLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT

00:37:48.132 --> 00:37:50.234
ACROSS THE NATION. SO CALIFORNIA

00:37:50.301 --> 00:37:52.770
FINALLY TOOK ACTION TO CURB THE

00:37:52.837 --> 00:37:55.239
GHOST GUN ISSUE. HOWEVER, THAT

00:37:55.306 --> 00:37:57.008
JUST KIND OF SHIFTED THE PROBLEM

00:37:57.074 --> 00:37:59.644
FROM COMPLETELY MANUFACTURED

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:02.546
GHOST GUNS TO GHOST GUNS FRAMES

00:38:02.613 --> 00:38:03.848
BEING MANUFACTURED AT HOME WITH

00:38:03.914 --> 00:38:06.384
3D PRINTERS. THOSE 3D PRINTERS

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:08.953
HAVE BECOME VASTLY MORE

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:11.088
EFFICIENT AND RELIABLE. AND NOW

00:38:11.155 --> 00:38:12.657
WE HAVE THESE GHOST GUNS BEING

00:38:12.723 --> 00:38:14.291
PRODUCED AT HOME. ONE COMPONENT

00:38:14.358 --> 00:38:15.893
THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:18.095
PEOPLE TO PRODUCE AT HOME IS THE

00:38:18.162 --> 00:38:19.764
BARREL. IT NORMALLY NEEDS TO BE

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:21.666
PROFESSIONALLY MANUFACTURED, AND

00:38:21.732 --> 00:38:24.535
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEKING TO

00:38:24.602 --> 00:38:25.469
CURTAIL. THE GHOST GUN ISSUE

00:38:25.536 --> 00:38:27.772
WITH 3D PRINTERS IS HARD TO DEAL

00:38:27.838 --> 00:38:28.839
WITH THE SOFTWARE BECAUSE IT'S

00:38:28.906 --> 00:38:31.742
ALREADY OUT THERE. AND TO THE

00:38:31.809 --> 00:38:33.611
MANUFACTURERS OF THESE ITEMS,

00:38:33.678 --> 00:38:35.579
IT'S NOT REALLY ILLEGAL FOR THEM

00:38:35.646 --> 00:38:37.882
TO ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN. SO 3D

00:38:37.948 --> 00:38:39.784
PRINTED GUNS, THE WAY TO CONTROL

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:41.118
THAT IS THROUGH THE BARRELS.

00:38:41.185 --> 00:38:43.454
THANK YOU. I'M HERE FOR

00:38:43.521 --> 00:38:44.622
QUESTIONS AND I ASK FOR YOUR

00:38:44.689 --> 00:38:46.290
VOTE. HEY, GOOD MORNING, CHAIR

00:38:46.357 --> 00:38:47.658
MEMBERS JONATHAN FELDMAN WITH

00:38:47.725 --> 00:38:49.126
THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS

00:38:49.193 --> 00:38:50.461
ASSOCIATION. FIRST, I WANT TO

00:38:50.528 --> 00:38:51.495
APOLOGIZE THAT OUR LETTER DIDN'T

00:38:51.562 --> 00:38:54.231
GET IN ON TIME. WE TOOK A LATE

00:38:54.298 --> 00:38:55.433
SUPPORT POSITION ON THE BILL,

00:38:55.499 --> 00:38:56.400
AND THAT WAS LARGELY BECAUSE THE

00:38:56.467 --> 00:38:57.935
DEBATES INTERNALLY WITHIN THE

00:38:58.002 --> 00:39:00.037
CHIEFS ON FIREARMS REGULATIONS

00:39:00.104 --> 00:39:01.439
ARE CONTENTIOUS. RIGHT? IF YOU

00:39:01.505 --> 00:39:04.408
CAN IMAGINE, THERE ARE A LOT OF

00:39:04.475 --> 00:39:05.009
POLICE CHIEFS THAT HAVE FIRM

00:39:05.076 --> 00:39:06.210
SECOND AMENDMENT BELIEFS. BUT

00:39:06.277 --> 00:39:08.045
THROUGH THOSE CONVERSATIONS, OUR

00:39:08.112 --> 00:39:08.713
PERSPECTIVE AND OUR GUIDING

00:39:08.779 --> 00:39:10.881
PRINCIPLE ALWAYS IS WHAT IS GOOD

00:39:10.948 --> 00:39:14.552
FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. IT'S OVERALL

00:39:14.618 --> 00:39:15.419
THE BENEFITS VERSUS THE BURDENS.

00:39:15.486 --> 00:39:18.422
AND IN THIS CASE, ABSOLUTELY THE

00:39:18.489 --> 00:39:20.191
BENEFITS IN REGULATING THE

00:39:20.257 --> 00:39:22.059
BARRELS, WHICH ARE CRITICAL

00:39:22.126 --> 00:39:23.194
COMPONENTS OF THE GHOST GUNS

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:24.595
THAT ARE A PREVALENT PROBLEM AND

00:39:24.662 --> 00:39:25.830
BECOMING EVEN MORE SO THROUGHOUT

00:39:25.896 --> 00:39:28.199
THE STATE. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

00:39:28.265 --> 00:39:30.234
EVERY BIT OF INFORMATION THAT WE

00:39:30.301 --> 00:39:32.203
CAN GAIN TO INVESTIGATE, PREVENT

00:39:32.269 --> 00:39:33.437
AND PROTECT AGAINST GUN

00:39:33.504 --> 00:39:37.575
VIOLENCE, WE ADD TO THE BITS OF

00:39:37.641 --> 00:39:39.710
INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE TO DO

00:39:39.777 --> 00:39:41.112
EVERYTHING THAT WE POSSIBLY CAN

00:39:41.178 --> 00:39:43.114
TO PREVENT THE TYPE OF VIOLENCE

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:44.482
THAT IS BEING COMMITTED THROUGH

00:39:44.548 --> 00:39:46.050
THE USE OF THESE FIREARMS. AND

00:39:46.117 --> 00:39:47.251
FOR THAT REASON, WE STRONGLY

00:39:47.318 --> 00:39:49.286
SUPPORT THE BILL. ASK FOR YOUR

00:39:49.353 --> 00:39:50.287
VOTE. THANK YOU, SENATOR, FOR

00:39:50.354 --> 00:39:51.589
THE PRESENTATION. GENTLEMEN.

00:39:51.655 --> 00:39:52.623
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY.

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:53.724
NEXT, WE'LL HEAR THE METOOS.

00:39:53.791 --> 00:39:55.626
ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT OF THE

00:39:55.693 --> 00:39:57.394
BILL COME FORWARD. NAME,

00:39:57.461 --> 00:39:58.028
ORGANIZATION AND POSITION ONLY,

00:39:58.095 --> 00:39:59.730
PLEASE. ETHAN NAGLER, ON BEHALF

00:39:59.797 --> 00:40:02.833
OF THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA AND

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:07.772
STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. GOOD

00:40:07.838 --> 00:40:08.806
MORNING, CHAIR AND MEMBERS.

00:40:08.873 --> 00:40:10.407
REBECCA MARCUS, ON BEHALF OF MY

00:40:10.474 --> 00:40:11.842
COLLEAGUES AT EVERYTOWN FOR GUN

00:40:11.909 --> 00:40:13.878
SAFETY AND GIFFORDS, THANK YOU.

00:40:13.944 --> 00:40:17.648
IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU FOR THE

00:40:17.715 --> 00:40:18.949
CLARIFICATION. ANYONE ELSE? ALL

00:40:19.016 --> 00:40:20.718
RIGHT. WELL, NEXT, WITNESSES IN

00:40:20.785 --> 00:40:21.652
OPPOSITION. DO WE HAVE ANYONE

00:40:21.719 --> 00:40:23.020
HERE TESTIFYING IN OPPOSITION?

00:40:23.087 --> 00:40:24.688
WE DO. PLEASE COME FORWARD. ONCE

00:40:24.755 --> 00:40:25.790
YOU BEGIN SPEAKING, YOU WILL

00:40:25.856 --> 00:40:27.591
HAVE A COMBINED TOTAL TIME OF

00:40:27.658 --> 00:40:28.893
FIVE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE

00:40:28.959 --> 00:40:40.905
COMMITTEE. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT.

00:40:40.971 --> 00:40:41.972
MORNING, CHAIR AND MEMBERS. MY

00:40:42.039 --> 00:40:43.507
NAME IS ADAM WILSON. I'M HERE ON

00:40:43.574 --> 00:40:45.876
BEHALF OF GUN OWNERS OF

00:40:45.943 --> 00:40:46.677
CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA RIFLE AND

00:40:46.744 --> 00:40:48.112
PISTOL ASSOCIATION AND THE

00:40:48.179 --> 00:40:50.714
NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION. WE

00:40:50.781 --> 00:40:52.716
OPPOSE 704. IT'S BUILT ON

00:40:52.783 --> 00:40:53.851
SPECULATION, NOT EVIDENCE, AND

00:40:53.918 --> 00:40:55.653
IT TARGETS THE WRONG PEOPLE. THE

00:40:55.719 --> 00:40:57.354
AUTHOR CLAIMS THIS BILL WILL

00:40:57.421 --> 00:40:58.989
STOP GHOST GUNS BY REGULATING

00:40:59.056 --> 00:41:00.658
FIREARM BARRELS. BUT

00:41:00.724 --> 00:41:02.092
CALIFORNIA'S OWN DOJ GHOST GUN

00:41:02.159 --> 00:41:03.894
REPORT MAKES IT CLEAR THAT THE

00:41:03.961 --> 00:41:05.729
VAST MAJORITY OF PRIVATELY MADE

00:41:05.796 --> 00:41:07.097
FIREARMS RECOVERED BY LAW

00:41:07.164 --> 00:41:08.566
ENFORCEMENT ARE BUILT FROM

00:41:08.632 --> 00:41:10.134
COMPLETE KITS PURCHASED ONLINE

00:41:10.201 --> 00:41:11.502
KITS THAT ALREADY INCLUDE

00:41:11.569 --> 00:41:14.305
BARRELS. MEANWHILE, SB 704

00:41:14.371 --> 00:41:15.806
IMPOSES STRICT REQUIREMENTS ON

00:41:15.873 --> 00:41:17.575
THE SALE OF INDIVIDUAL BARRELS,

00:41:17.641 --> 00:41:19.176
INCLUDING BACKGROUND CHECKS AND

00:41:19.243 --> 00:41:21.245
DEALER TRANSFERS, YET ADMITS

00:41:21.312 --> 00:41:22.646
THAT THE DOJ CANNOT RETAIN THE

00:41:22.713 --> 00:41:24.315
BUYER'S INFORMATION. SO EVEN

00:41:24.381 --> 00:41:25.616
UNDER THIS NEW SYSTEM, THERE'S

00:41:25.683 --> 00:41:26.717
NO WAY TO TRACK THESE BARRELS

00:41:26.784 --> 00:41:29.220
ONCE THEY'VE BEEN SOLD. BARRELS

00:41:29.286 --> 00:41:32.423
ALSO AREN'T SERIALIZED. IT

00:41:32.489 --> 00:41:33.424
CREATES PAPERWORK, NOT

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:36.360
PREVENTION. THIS BILL DOESN'T

00:41:36.427 --> 00:41:37.761
STOP CRIMINALS. IT IMPACTS THE

00:41:37.828 --> 00:41:39.930
LAW ABIDING HOBBYISTS AT HOME

00:41:39.997 --> 00:41:41.365
TRYING TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY

00:41:41.432 --> 00:41:43.167
OF THEIR RIFLE, OR SOMEONE

00:41:43.234 --> 00:41:44.335
SWAPPING A WORN BARREL ON A

00:41:44.401 --> 00:41:46.370
LEGACY FIREARM. IT TURNS SIMPLE

00:41:46.437 --> 00:41:47.705
LEGAL ACTS INTO CRIMINAL

00:41:47.771 --> 00:41:49.740
LIABILITY NOT BECAUSE OF MISUSE,

00:41:49.807 --> 00:41:51.442
BUT BECAUSE THE STATE WANTS TO

00:41:51.508 --> 00:41:52.376
MICROMANAGE GUN OWNERSHIP

00:41:52.443 --> 00:41:55.112
THROUGH REGULATION OF PARTS.

00:41:55.179 --> 00:41:55.779
CONSTITUTIONALLY, IT STILL

00:41:55.846 --> 00:41:57.581
CROSSES A LINE. THE SUPREME

00:41:57.648 --> 00:41:58.716
COURT HAS AFFIRMED THAT THE

00:41:58.782 --> 00:41:59.750
SECOND AMENDMENT PROTECTS THE

00:41:59.817 --> 00:42:00.851
RIGHT TO KEEP ARMS AND

00:42:00.918 --> 00:42:03.287
FUNCTIONING CONDITION, WHILE SB

00:42:03.354 --> 00:42:05.155
704 DOESN'T OUTRIGHT BAN

00:42:05.222 --> 00:42:06.390
BARRELS, IT IMPOSES BARRIERS

00:42:06.457 --> 00:42:07.892
THAT MAKE IT HARDER AND RISKIER

00:42:07.958 --> 00:42:10.494
FOR LAWFUL CITIZENS TO MAINTAIN,

00:42:10.561 --> 00:42:11.929
REPAIR, AND UPGRADE THEIR

00:42:11.996 --> 00:42:13.430
FIREARMS. AND THAT UNDERMINES

00:42:13.497 --> 00:42:16.667
THE RIGHT ITSELF. SB 704 IS

00:42:16.734 --> 00:42:18.035
SYMBOLIC, NOT EFFECTIVE. IT

00:42:18.102 --> 00:42:19.503
BURDENS THE WRONG PEOPLE AND

00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:21.005
SOLVES A PROBLEM THAT CALIFORNIA

00:42:21.071 --> 00:42:23.040
LAW ALREADY CLAIMS TO ADDRESS.

00:42:23.107 --> 00:42:25.276
AND AGAIN, IF CRIMINALS CAN'T BE

00:42:25.342 --> 00:42:26.744
TRACKED IN BARRELS, CAN'T BE

00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:28.178
TRACKED, THEN WHAT'S THE POINT

00:42:28.245 --> 00:42:33.217
OF THIS BILL? WE URGE A NO VOTE.

00:42:33.284 --> 00:42:34.618
MR. CHAIRMAN. MEMBERS, FORGIVE

00:42:34.685 --> 00:42:36.754
ME. IT WAS AN ADVENTURE COMING

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:39.290
IN HERE, PUTTING MY BELT ON.

00:42:39.356 --> 00:42:40.925
WHILE I'M HERE AT THE TABLE. I

00:42:40.991 --> 00:42:42.459
WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY

00:42:42.526 --> 00:42:44.328
COLLEAGUE HERE, SAM PAREDES,

00:42:44.395 --> 00:42:44.828
REPRESENTING GUN OWNERS

00:42:44.895 --> 00:42:45.863
CALIFORNIA AND NATIONAL RIFLE

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:47.331
ASSOCIATION AND THE CALIFORNIA

00:42:47.398 --> 00:42:49.400
RIFLE AND PISTOL ASSOCIATION.

00:42:49.466 --> 00:42:53.270
THE FOCUS ON BARRELS, AS OPPOSED

00:42:53.337 --> 00:42:56.607
TO THE FOCUS ON CRIMINALS IS

00:42:56.674 --> 00:42:59.810
MISGUIDED. I BELIEVE THAT THAT

00:42:59.877 --> 00:43:01.712
THIS LEGISLATURE, THIS COMMITTEE

00:43:01.779 --> 00:43:03.847
SHOULD LOOK AT THE SUCCESSES OF

00:43:03.914 --> 00:43:05.916
OAKLAND, BALTIMORE AND MANY

00:43:05.983 --> 00:43:07.751
OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE

00:43:07.818 --> 00:43:11.789
SWITCHED THEIR FOCUS FROM GUN

00:43:11.855 --> 00:43:14.325
CONTROL AS THE SOLUTION FOR THE

00:43:14.391 --> 00:43:16.560
CRIMINAL MISUSE OF FIREARMS. AS

00:43:16.627 --> 00:43:18.195
A MATTER OF FACT, WE HAVE

00:43:18.262 --> 00:43:20.297
OAKLAND THAT HAS SEEN A 45%

00:43:20.364 --> 00:43:22.199
DECREASE IN CRIMINAL MISUSE OF

00:43:22.266 --> 00:43:25.402
FIREARMS. BALTIMORE HAS SEEN A

00:43:25.469 --> 00:43:26.503
SIMILAR DECREASE. CITIES

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:29.740
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THAT ARE

00:43:29.807 --> 00:43:32.910
PRONE TO FIREARMS VIOLENCE, 35%

00:43:32.977 --> 00:43:34.478
DECREASE. AND IT IS BECAUSE THEY

00:43:34.545 --> 00:43:36.213
HAVE SWITCHED THEIR FOCUS FROM

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:39.783
GUN CONTROL TO CRIME CONTROL AND

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:41.185
FOCUSING ON THOSE WHO ARE MOST

00:43:41.251 --> 00:43:44.755
WILLING OR APT TO COMMIT A CRIME

00:43:44.822 --> 00:43:48.025
WITH A FIREARM THAT WORKS. THIS

00:43:48.092 --> 00:43:51.261
BILL WILL SERVE NO PURPOSE IN

00:43:51.328 --> 00:43:54.164
REDUCING ANY SORT OF MISUSE OF

00:43:54.231 --> 00:43:56.667
FIREARMS. CRIMINALS, AS YOU WELL

00:43:56.734 --> 00:43:58.836
KNOW, CAN ACCESS ANYTHING THEY

00:43:58.902 --> 00:44:02.172
WANT, ANYTIME THEY WANT. PERIOD.

00:44:02.239 --> 00:44:04.241
ALL OF THE LAWS IN THE WORLD ARE

00:44:04.308 --> 00:44:04.875
NOT GOING TO PREVENT THEM FROM

00:44:04.942 --> 00:44:06.510
DOING THAT. THIS BILL ONLY

00:44:06.577 --> 00:44:07.945
AFFECTS LAW ABIDING CITIZENS WHO

00:44:08.012 --> 00:44:09.813
WANT NOTHING MORE THAN TO

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.548
UPGRADE OR REPAIR THEIR GUNS.

00:44:11.615 --> 00:44:13.584
AND NOW THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:15.019
ANOTHER HOOP, WHICH WE BELIEVE

00:44:15.085 --> 00:44:16.253
TO BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL. FOR

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.222
THESE REASONS, WE ARE STRONGLY

00:44:18.288 --> 00:44:20.524
OPPOSED TO THIS MEASURE. THANK

00:44:20.591 --> 00:44:21.358
YOU, GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU BOTH

00:44:21.425 --> 00:44:23.060
FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. WE'LL TAKE

00:44:23.127 --> 00:44:24.628
ANY OTHER METOOS IN THE ROOM. IF

00:44:24.695 --> 00:44:26.196
YOU'RE OPPOSED TO THE MEASURE,

00:44:26.263 --> 00:44:27.197
PLEASE COME FORWARD. NAME,

00:44:27.264 --> 00:44:28.365
ORGANIZATION AND POSITION,

00:44:28.432 --> 00:44:30.267
PLEASE. LESLIE CALDWELL,

HOUSTON, CALIFORNIA. PUBLIC

THANK THE AUTHOR, THE SENATOR.

00:44:36.306 --> 00:44:38.542
THANK YOU. AND THE COMMITTEE. WE

00:44:38.609 --> 00:44:43.113
ARE WITHDRAWING OUR OPPOSITION.

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:44.448
AUBRY RODRIGUEZ WITH ACLU

00:44:44.515 --> 00:44:45.649
CALIFORNIA ACTION. JUST REAL

00:44:45.716 --> 00:44:47.418
QUICK, WANT TO SAY THAT WE

00:44:47.484 --> 00:44:48.385
APPRECIATE THE SENATOR AND THE

00:44:48.452 --> 00:44:49.720
STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US, AND

00:44:49.787 --> 00:44:51.488
WE HOPE TO EVENTUALLY REMOVE

00:44:51.555 --> 00:44:52.689
THAT WOBBLER AND THEN HOPEFULLY

00:44:52.756 --> 00:44:53.857
REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION. BUT RIGHT

00:44:53.924 --> 00:44:55.292
NOW, AS IN PRINT, WE ARE

00:44:55.359 --> 00:44:57.127
OPPOSED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU

00:44:57.194 --> 00:44:58.495
VERY MUCH. FINAL CALL. ANYONE

00:44:58.562 --> 00:45:01.165
ELSE HOPING TO BE HEARD ON THE

00:45:01.231 --> 00:45:02.466
MATTER? SEEING NONE, I WILL TURN

00:45:02.533 --> 00:45:03.500
IT OVER TO THE DAIS FOR ANY

00:45:03.567 --> 00:45:05.502
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ANY

00:45:05.569 --> 00:45:07.237
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM

00:45:07.304 --> 00:45:09.706
COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY. SEEING

00:45:09.773 --> 00:45:11.141
NONE. SENATOR, WOULD YOU LIKE TO

00:45:11.208 --> 00:45:12.276
CLOSE AND PERHAPS I'LL PITCH YOU

00:45:12.342 --> 00:45:13.610
A QUESTION FOR AID OF CLOSING.

00:45:13.677 --> 00:45:15.379
YOU HEARD SOME CONCERNS RAISED

00:45:15.446 --> 00:45:16.947
BY THE OPPOSITION. IF YOU HAVE

00:45:17.014 --> 00:45:18.182
ANY RESPONSE FOR THE COMMITTEE,

00:45:18.248 --> 00:45:19.883
THIS WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:20.484
TIME. I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY

00:45:20.551 --> 00:45:22.753
THAT THIS BILL IS NOT INTENDED

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:23.654
TO BURDEN LAW ABIDING CITIZENS

00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:24.755
WHO GO THROUGH THE BACKGROUND

00:45:24.822 --> 00:45:27.091
PROCESS TO LEGALLY PURCHASE A

00:45:27.157 --> 00:45:28.659
GUN. WE HAVE EXEMPTED LAW

00:45:28.725 --> 00:45:29.860
ENFORCEMENT, MILITARY AND

00:45:29.927 --> 00:45:30.928
PERSONS UNDERGOING A BACKGROUND

00:45:30.994 --> 00:45:34.131
CHECK. AND THIS IS A REAL ISSUE,

00:45:34.198 --> 00:45:35.699
AND THIS IS A SOLUTION TO SOLVE

00:45:35.766 --> 00:45:38.402
A REAL ISSUE. AS I SAID, 592%

00:45:38.469 --> 00:45:40.037
INCREASE IN GHOST GUNS RECOVERED

00:45:40.104 --> 00:45:42.206
IN CALIFORNIA REPRESENT 70% OF

00:45:42.272 --> 00:45:44.274
THE GUNS RECOVERED BY LAW

00:45:44.341 --> 00:45:45.476
ENFORCEMENT. AND SO THE MORE WE

00:45:45.542 --> 00:45:47.911
CAN TRY TO MAKE IT MORE

00:45:47.978 --> 00:45:50.781
DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO

00:45:50.848 --> 00:45:52.549
CONSTRUCT THESE ILLEGAL GUNS, WE

00:45:52.616 --> 00:45:54.852
CAN REDUCE THE HARM THAT'S BEING

00:45:54.918 --> 00:45:55.419
INFLICTED ON COMMUNITIES IN

00:45:55.486 --> 00:45:56.487
CALIFORNIA. WITH THAT, I

00:45:56.553 --> 00:45:57.588
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE.

00:45:57.654 --> 00:45:59.389
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SENATOR.

00:45:59.456 --> 00:46:00.424
COLLEAGUES, THE CHAIR IS

00:46:00.491 --> 00:46:01.625
RECOMMENDING AND I APPRECIATE

00:46:01.692 --> 00:46:03.293
THE WORK OF THE AUTHOR. WE DO

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.661
NOT YET HAVE A QUORUM, SO WE'LL

00:46:04.728 --> 00:46:06.263
LET YOU KNOW THE OUTCOME.

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:07.531
SENATOR, THANK YOU, EVERYONE FOR

00:46:07.598 --> 00:46:08.532
BEING HERE. WE'LL TAKE THE

00:46:08.599 --> 00:46:10.567
MOTION AND VOTE LATER. NEXT, I

00:46:10.634 --> 00:46:11.535
SEE THAT SENATOR WAHAB HAS

00:46:11.602 --> 00:46:12.703
ARRIVED, SO WE'LL BE MOVING TO

00:46:12.769 --> 00:46:14.037
ITEM NUMBER SIX. COLLEAGUES,

00:46:14.104 --> 00:46:16.373
THIS IS SENATE BILL 258. I WILL

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.208
NOTE THAT I ALSO SEE SENATOR

00:46:18.275 --> 00:46:20.310
UMBERG IN THE ROOM. SO AS SOON

00:46:20.377 --> 00:46:21.645
AS WE'RE DONE WITH SENATOR

00:46:21.712 --> 00:46:22.646
WAHAB, WE'LL MOVE TO SENATOR

00:46:22.713 --> 00:46:23.580
UMBERG. AFTER THAT, I BELIEVE

00:46:23.647 --> 00:46:25.082
SENATOR HURTADO IS THE NEXT IN

00:46:25.149 --> 00:46:26.483
THE QUEUE. IF YOU HAVE NOT YET

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:28.252
SIGNED IT AND YOU'RE AN AUTHOR,

00:46:28.318 --> 00:46:30.053
PLEASE COME ON DOWN. SENATOR

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.688
WAHAB, WHEN YOU'RE READY, THE

00:46:31.755 --> 00:46:40.797
FLOOR IS YOURS. ALL RIGHT. SO,

00:46:40.864 --> 00:46:42.166
CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS, I

00:46:42.232 --> 00:46:45.202
WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR

00:46:45.269 --> 00:46:48.305
PATIENCE. SB 258 CLOSES THE LAST

00:46:48.372 --> 00:46:50.474
SPOUSAL RAPE LOOPHOLE IN

00:46:50.541 --> 00:46:52.910
CALIFORNIA LAW. THIS BILL IS A

00:46:52.976 --> 00:46:54.011
LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS

00:46:54.077 --> 00:46:56.146
PRIORITY BILL. CURRENTLY, OUR

00:46:56.213 --> 00:46:58.482
LAW PERMITS THE RAPE OF A SPOUSE

00:46:58.549 --> 00:47:00.817
WHO IS UNABLE TO CONSENT DUE TO

00:47:00.884 --> 00:47:02.319
A DISABILITY, WHILE THE SAME ACT

00:47:02.386 --> 00:47:03.787
OF RAPE COMMITTED BY AN

00:47:03.854 --> 00:47:06.690
UNMARRIED PARTNER IS A CRIME,

00:47:06.757 --> 00:47:07.991
DISABILITY CAN IMPEDE PEOPLE'S

00:47:08.058 --> 00:47:09.893
ABILITY TO CONSENT, WHETHER IT'S

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:11.728
BECAUSE OF AN INTELLECTUAL OR

00:47:11.795 --> 00:47:12.930
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY OR AN

00:47:12.996 --> 00:47:14.531
AGE RELATED DISEASE LIKE

00:47:14.598 --> 00:47:17.000
ALZHEIMER'S OR DEMENTIA. ANYONE

00:47:17.067 --> 00:47:18.569
WHO KNOWINGLY TAKES ADVANTAGE OF

00:47:18.635 --> 00:47:21.171
A PERSON WHEN THEY ARE UNABLE TO

00:47:21.238 --> 00:47:23.273
CONSENT TO SEX BECAUSE OF THEIR

00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:26.143
DISABILITY IS A RAPIST, WHICH IS

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:27.945
WHY NO OTHER PART OF THE PENAL

00:47:28.011 --> 00:47:29.379
CODE REGARDING SEX CRIMES

00:47:29.446 --> 00:47:31.215
AGAINST PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES

00:47:31.281 --> 00:47:33.016
EXEMPTS SPOUSES FROM THE

00:47:33.083 --> 00:47:35.886
DEFINITION. RAPE IS RAPE. WE

00:47:35.953 --> 00:47:37.221
NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE

00:47:37.287 --> 00:47:38.322
PROTECTING THE MOST VULNERABLE

00:47:38.388 --> 00:47:41.258
AMONG US. 42 OTHER STATES HAVE

00:47:41.325 --> 00:47:43.393
ALREADY ELIMINATED SPOUSAL RAPE

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:45.128
EXCEPTIONS, AND CALIFORNIA IS

00:47:45.195 --> 00:47:47.264
LONG OVERDUE TO FOLLOW SUIT.

00:47:47.331 --> 00:47:50.234
THIS BILL WOULD ENSURE THAT

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:51.635
PERPETRATORS WHO RAPE THEIR

00:47:51.702 --> 00:47:53.203
SPOUSES WHEN THEY ARE UNABLE TO

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:54.571
CONSENT BECAUSE OF A DISABILITY

00:47:54.638 --> 00:47:57.207
WOULD FACE JUSTICE HERE TODAY IN

00:47:57.274 --> 00:47:59.610
SUPPORT OF SB 258 OR TERRI

00:47:59.676 --> 00:48:00.711

REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES, OR AKA

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:12.522
A NETWORK OF 21 COMMUNITY

00:48:12.589 --> 00:48:14.725

400,000 INDIVIDUALS WITH

00:48:16.193 --> 00:48:24.401
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. GOOD

00:48:24.468 --> 00:48:26.570
MORNING. ON BEHALF OF DISTRICT

00:48:26.637 --> 00:48:28.438
ATTORNEY JEFF ROSEN, THE SANTA

00:48:28.505 --> 00:48:30.641
CLARA COUNTY DA'S OFFICE IS IN

00:48:30.707 --> 00:48:32.609
SUPPORT OF SB 258. MY NAME IS

00:48:32.676 --> 00:48:34.478
TERRY HARMON. I'M AN ASSISTANT

00:48:34.544 --> 00:48:37.547
DA. I OVERSEE OUR SEXUAL ASSAULT

00:48:37.614 --> 00:48:40.217
UNIT. THERE CAN BE MANY DEFENSES

00:48:40.284 --> 00:48:43.854
TO AN ALLEGATION OF RAPE. I AM

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:46.356
MARRIED TO THE PERPETRATOR. I AM

00:48:46.423 --> 00:48:47.624
MARRIED TO THE VICTIM. SHOULD

00:48:47.691 --> 00:48:50.694
NOT BE ONE OF THEM. FAR MORE

00:48:50.761 --> 00:48:52.796
PEOPLE ARE VULNERABLE TO SEXUAL

00:48:52.863 --> 00:48:55.499
ASSAULT BECAUSE OF THIS LOOPHOLE

00:48:55.565 --> 00:48:58.935
THAN IF WE GET RID OF IT. THE

00:48:59.002 --> 00:49:00.771
LEGISLATURE HAS ALREADY

00:49:00.837 --> 00:49:03.273
DETERMINED THAT IT IS UNLAWFUL

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:04.708
TO HAVE SEXUAL INTERCOURSE WITH

00:49:04.775 --> 00:49:07.177
SOMEONE WHO CANNOT CONSENT,

00:49:07.244 --> 00:49:08.745
WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE THIS

00:49:08.812 --> 00:49:11.548
SECTION IN THE FIRST PLACE. WHY

00:49:11.615 --> 00:49:13.884
DOES BEING MARRIED MAKE THIS

00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:18.021
ILLEGAL ACT LEGAL? THE ABILITY

00:49:18.088 --> 00:49:19.523
TO CONSENT IS NOT A PERMANENT

00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:22.059
LABEL FOR ANY OF US. IT IS NOT

00:49:22.125 --> 00:49:24.194
STATIC OR UNCHANGING. IT IS

00:49:24.261 --> 00:49:27.030
FLUID. PEOPLE CAN BE BORN WITH

00:49:27.097 --> 00:49:28.131
DISABILITIES AND PEOPLE CAN

00:49:28.198 --> 00:49:31.702
BECOME DISABLED THROUGH AGE.

00:49:31.768 --> 00:49:33.003
ALZHEIMER'S, LOU GEHRIG'S PEOPLE

00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:34.638
CAN SUFFER TRAUMATIC BRAIN

00:49:34.705 --> 00:49:37.140
INJURY DUE TO A CAR ACCIDENT.

00:49:37.207 --> 00:49:40.010
WHETHER SOMEONE IS CAPABLE OF

00:49:40.077 --> 00:49:42.145
CONSENTING TO SEXUAL INTERCOURSE

00:49:42.212 --> 00:49:45.182
MUST BE EVALUATED IN CONJUNCTION

00:49:45.248 --> 00:49:47.517
WITH THE EVENT ITSELF AND THE

00:49:47.584 --> 00:49:50.087
SURROUNDING CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS

00:49:50.153 --> 00:49:52.989
BILL DOES NOT CRIMINALIZE

00:49:53.056 --> 00:49:56.226
CONSENSUAL SEX. THIS BILL ALLOWS

00:49:56.293 --> 00:49:58.729
DISABLED PEOPLE TO HAVE AGENCY

00:49:58.795 --> 00:50:00.931
OVER THEIR LIVES AND TO HAVE SEX

00:50:00.997 --> 00:50:02.799
WHEN THEY WANT, AND NOT TO HAVE

00:50:02.866 --> 00:50:04.935
IT THRUST UPON THEM WHEN THEY

00:50:05.001 --> 00:50:08.138
DON'T. BECAUSE PART OF SEX LIFE

00:50:08.205 --> 00:50:10.240
CONTROL IS THE RIGHT TO SAY NO,

00:50:10.307 --> 00:50:12.743
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU ARE

00:50:12.809 --> 00:50:15.212
MARRIED TO THAT PERSON. WE

00:50:15.278 --> 00:50:17.114
PROSECUTE ACTS OF RAPE STEMMING

00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:19.349
FROM ALL SORTS OF SITUATIONS AND

00:50:19.416 --> 00:50:22.085
WITHIN THE CONFINES OF DIFFERENT

00:50:22.152 --> 00:50:24.354
RELATIONSHIPS. STRANGER DATING,

00:50:24.421 --> 00:50:27.591
LIFE PARTNER, SPOUSE. RAPE IS AN

00:50:27.657 --> 00:50:30.394
ACT OF VIOLENCE. IT OFTEN LEAVES

00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:32.863
PHYSICAL WOUNDS AND ALWAYS

00:50:32.929 --> 00:50:35.465
INFLICTS EMOTIONAL TRAUMA. AND

00:50:35.532 --> 00:50:37.200
RAPE IS RAPE, REGARDLESS OF THE

00:50:37.267 --> 00:50:39.536
MARITAL STATUS BETWEEN THE TWO

00:50:39.603 --> 00:50:42.305
PARTIES. AND IT IS TIME THAT

00:50:42.372 --> 00:50:43.707
CALIFORNIA LAW REFLECTS THAT.

00:50:43.774 --> 00:50:47.244
THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING. GOOD

00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:48.945
MORNING CHAIR. MORNING, MEMBERS.

00:50:49.012 --> 00:50:50.480
TONY ANDERSEN, ASSOCIATION OF

00:50:50.547 --> 00:50:52.182
REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES FOR

00:50:52.249 --> 00:50:53.850
OVER 54 YEARS NOW, REGIONAL

00:50:53.917 --> 00:50:55.585
CENTERS HAVE SERVED CALIFORNIANS

00:50:55.652 --> 00:50:57.120
WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES

00:50:57.187 --> 00:50:58.588
THROUGHOUT THEIR ENTIRE LIVES.

00:50:58.655 --> 00:51:00.357
OUR CENTRAL CHARGE OF THE

00:51:00.424 --> 00:51:01.458
REGIONAL CENTERS IS TO HELP

00:51:01.525 --> 00:51:02.893
PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL

00:51:02.959 --> 00:51:04.194
DISABILITIES TO BECOME FULL

00:51:04.261 --> 00:51:05.395
PARTICIPANTS IN THEIR

00:51:05.462 --> 00:51:06.997
COMMUNITIES, FREE OF

00:51:07.063 --> 00:51:09.232
SEGREGATION. THE CENTER'S FIGHT

00:51:09.299 --> 00:51:10.801
ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR THE HUMAN

00:51:10.867 --> 00:51:12.469
AND CIVIL RIGHTS OF PEOPLE WITH

00:51:12.536 --> 00:51:13.703
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES TO

00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:15.472
HAVE ACCESS TO EVERY FACET OF A

00:51:15.539 --> 00:51:17.307
PERSON'S LIFE, LIKE ANYONE ELSE

00:51:17.374 --> 00:51:18.875
WITHOUT A DISABILITY. WHILE IT

00:51:18.942 --> 00:51:20.510
IS TRUE THAT PEOPLE WITH

00:51:20.577 --> 00:51:21.478
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES HAVE

00:51:21.545 --> 00:51:24.014
UNIQUE NEEDS, THEY ALSO HAVE THE

00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:25.816
SAME NEEDS AS ANYONE ELSE, AND

00:51:25.882 --> 00:51:27.350
THIS INCLUDES THE NEED TO HAVE A

00:51:27.417 --> 00:51:29.019
FRIENDSHIPS, INTIMATE

00:51:29.085 --> 00:51:30.987
RELATIONSHIPS, AND MARRIAGE.

00:51:31.054 --> 00:51:32.656
UNFORTUNATELY, IF THEY CHOOSE TO

00:51:32.722 --> 00:51:34.458
GET MARRIED. CURRENT LAW.

00:51:34.524 --> 00:51:36.259
CURRENT LAW MAKES THEM MORE

00:51:36.326 --> 00:51:37.661
VULNERABLE TO SPOUSAL RAPE AND

00:51:37.727 --> 00:51:39.529
SEXUAL ASSAULT. AND THIS IS NOT

00:51:39.596 --> 00:51:40.997
FAIR OR EQUAL TREATMENT OF

00:51:41.064 --> 00:51:42.833
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. IF ANY

00:51:42.899 --> 00:51:44.601
GROUP SHOULD HAVE ADDITIONAL

00:51:44.668 --> 00:51:45.669
PROTECTIONS, IT SHOULD BE PEOPLE

00:51:45.735 --> 00:51:47.337
WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES.

00:51:47.404 --> 00:51:49.272
IT HAS BEEN WELL ESTABLISHED FOR

00:51:49.339 --> 00:51:50.407
DECADES THAT PEOPLE WITH

00:51:50.474 --> 00:51:51.775
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES ARE

00:51:51.842 --> 00:51:53.510
VICTIMS OF RAPE AND SEXUAL

00:51:53.577 --> 00:51:56.480
ASSAULT AT RATES 4 TO 10 TIMES

00:51:56.546 --> 00:51:58.315
HIGHER, AND MORE FREQUENTLY THAN

00:51:58.381 --> 00:52:00.116
PEOPLE WITHOUT DISABILITIES.

00:52:00.183 --> 00:52:01.017
THERE ARE MANY FACTORS THAT

00:52:01.084 --> 00:52:02.886
CONTRIBUTE TO THE HIGHER RATES.

00:52:02.953 --> 00:52:05.188
SOME ARE THE PERCEPTIONS BY

00:52:05.255 --> 00:52:07.157
PERPETRATORS THAT THE VICTIM

00:52:07.224 --> 00:52:09.059
WILL NOT BE A GOOD WITNESS IN

00:52:09.125 --> 00:52:11.228
COURT. THEY'RE THEY'RE MORE

00:52:11.294 --> 00:52:13.663
TRUSTING AND THAT THE SOMETIMES

00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:14.998
THEY'RE IN A POWER POSITION

00:52:15.065 --> 00:52:16.266
WHERE THEY'RE DEPENDENT ON THEIR

00:52:16.333 --> 00:52:17.968
FOOD, HEALTH, MEDICINE AND

00:52:18.034 --> 00:52:19.903
HOUSING, JUST TO NAME A FEW. THE

00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:21.738
BIGGEST CHALLENGE OF SEXUAL

00:52:21.805 --> 00:52:23.106
ASSAULT AGAINST PEOPLE WITH

00:52:23.173 --> 00:52:24.875
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES IS

00:52:24.941 --> 00:52:26.209
THAT IS THAT THE CRIMINAL

00:52:26.276 --> 00:52:28.612
JUSTICE SYSTEM DOES NOT PURSUE

00:52:28.678 --> 00:52:30.680
THE JUSTICE POPULATION FOR THIS

00:52:30.747 --> 00:52:32.916
POPULATION EQUITABLY. SOMEBODY

00:52:32.983 --> 00:52:34.584
HAS TO STAND UP FOR VICTIMS WITH

00:52:34.651 --> 00:52:35.719
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND

00:52:35.785 --> 00:52:36.920
FORCE THE JUSTICE SYSTEM TO

THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE SHOULD

EXCEPTION ON THE BOOKS TODAY IS

00:52:53.403 --> 00:52:54.738
CLEARLY A CRIME TO COMMIT RAPE

00:52:54.804 --> 00:52:56.139

00:53:13.690 --> 00:53:16.026
THE SPOUSE OF THE OFFENDER. SO

00:53:16.092 --> 00:53:19.162
SB 258 DECLARES RAPE IS RAPE

EVERYBODY STAFF ON THIS

00:55:45.542 --> 00:55:46.910
COMMITTEE, THE CALIFORNIA CODE

STANDARD, APPELLATE COURTS

ONE APPELLATE COURT NOTED, THE

00:56:15.371 --> 00:56:17.107

PEOPLE TO HAVE CONSENSUAL SEX.

00:56:21.144 --> 00:56:24.214
SB 238 WOULD NOT UPDATE THESE

EXPAND THEM TO MARRIED DISABLED

NOT ABOUT SITUATIONS IN WHICH A

INTIMATE RELATIONSHIPS OF THEIR

00:57:09.159 --> 00:57:11.761

TO BE HERE WITH THIS BILL THAT

00:57:13.396 --> 00:57:15.465

TERRIBLE MONTH FOR ALL OF US.

00:57:24.841 --> 00:57:26.176

00:59:26.396 --> 00:59:28.331
ON THE BILL. ALL RIGHT. WELL,

00:59:28.398 --> 00:59:29.732
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR YOUR

00:59:29.799 --> 00:59:31.801
TESTIMONY TODAY. WE'LL NOW TURN

00:59:31.868 --> 00:59:32.468
IT OVER TO THE DAIS. WOULD

00:59:32.535 --> 00:59:34.437
ANYONE LIKE TO GET US STARTED,

00:59:34.504 --> 00:59:38.341
MR. LACKEY? YEAH. I THINK THIS

00:59:38.408 --> 00:59:40.143
IS A VERY, VERY CRITICAL TOPIC,

00:59:40.209 --> 00:59:42.278
AND IT'S ONE THAT I FEEL VERY

00:59:42.345 --> 00:59:46.616
ATTACHED TO. AND ONE OF THE VERY

00:59:46.683 --> 00:59:48.484
DELICATE ISSUES, BUT DESERVES

00:59:48.551 --> 00:59:51.321
FURTHER DISCUSSION IS THE

00:59:51.387 --> 00:59:53.489
OPPOSITION HAS INDICATED THEIR

00:59:53.556 --> 00:59:55.325
CONCERN OVER THE CAPACITY TO

00:59:55.391 --> 00:59:57.427
CONSENT. AND IT IS A VERY, VERY

00:59:57.493 --> 00:59:59.228
CRITICAL ISSUE. I DON'T KNOW IF

00:59:59.295 --> 01:00:01.464
ANY OF YOU HAVE EVER SEEN THE

01:00:01.531 --> 01:00:04.267
PROGRAM LOVE ON THE SPECTRUM. IT

01:00:04.334 --> 01:00:06.469
TALKS ABOUT PEOPLE ON THE

01:00:06.536 --> 01:00:08.604
SPECTRUM WHO ARE ENGAGING IN

01:00:08.671 --> 01:00:10.773
RELATIONSHIPS. AND IF YOU

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.208
HAVEN'T SEEN IT, I HIGHLY

01:00:12.275 --> 01:00:13.343
RECOMMEND YOU WATCH AT LEAST A

01:00:13.409 --> 01:00:14.677
COUPLE EPISODES. YOU'LL PROBABLY

01:00:14.744 --> 01:00:17.313
GET HOOKED, BUT I WILL TELL YOU

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:20.016
THAT THIS IS A REAL THING, AND I

01:00:20.083 --> 01:00:23.219
THINK A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE WHO

01:00:23.286 --> 01:00:26.189
ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH PEOPLE THAT

01:00:26.255 --> 01:00:28.825
HAVE DISABILITIES DO NOT

01:00:28.891 --> 01:00:30.126
UNDERSTAND THE FACT THAT THERE

01:00:30.193 --> 01:00:32.395
ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT ARE

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:33.396
EVIDENCE OF IMPAIRMENT, AND

01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:35.598
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT

01:00:35.665 --> 01:00:37.000
PROVE THAT THERE IS NO

01:00:37.066 --> 01:00:38.868
IMPAIRMENT. AND EMOTION IS ONE

01:00:38.935 --> 01:00:41.337
OF THOSE MEASURING PIECES THAT

01:00:41.404 --> 01:00:44.374
OFTEN HAVE LIMITED TO NO

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:47.043
IMPAIRMENT. AND THEY LINK THE

01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:49.679
ABILITY TO CONSENT WITH THEIR

01:00:49.746 --> 01:00:51.948
OTHER DISABILITY. AND I THINK

01:00:52.015 --> 01:00:54.617
THAT THAT'S A VERY, VERY

01:00:54.684 --> 01:00:57.086
DANGEROUS PATHWAY. IF I COULD

01:00:57.153 --> 01:00:59.455
HAVE THE AUTHOR KIND OF CLARIFY

01:00:59.522 --> 01:01:01.624
THIS CAPACITY TO CONSENT AND HOW

01:01:01.691 --> 01:01:02.658
HER BILL ADDRESSES THAT.

01:01:02.725 --> 01:01:05.194
DEFINITELY. SO, AND I APPRECIATE

01:01:05.261 --> 01:01:06.963
THAT. I APPRECIATE ALL THE

01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:09.532
CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED. FIRST

01:01:09.599 --> 01:01:12.702
AND FOREMOST, THIS IS A VERY

01:01:12.769 --> 01:01:14.070
NARROW, TIGHTLY TARGETED BILL

01:01:14.137 --> 01:01:16.439
THAT SIMPLY REMOVES A SENTENCE

01:01:16.506 --> 01:01:18.508
FROM THE PENAL CODE IN ORDER TO

01:01:18.574 --> 01:01:19.776
ELIMINATE THE SPOUSAL RAPE

01:01:19.842 --> 01:01:22.278
EXCEPTION, RIGHT. ANY AMENDMENT

01:01:22.345 --> 01:01:24.247
TO THE DEFINITION OF CONSENT,

01:01:24.313 --> 01:01:25.581
INCLUDING A PRESUMPTION THAT

01:01:25.648 --> 01:01:27.450
EVERYONE IS COMPETENT OVER 18,

01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:29.318
COULD CREATE PROBLEMS FOR CASES

01:01:29.385 --> 01:01:31.287
INVOLVING ALCOHOL AND

01:01:31.354 --> 01:01:33.022
UNCONSCIOUSNESS. THAT IS ONE OF

01:01:33.089 --> 01:01:34.357
THE REASONS WHY WE ARE CONCERNED

01:01:34.424 --> 01:01:38.027
WITH CAPACITY. NO STATE IN THE

01:01:38.094 --> 01:01:39.829
UNITED STATES HAS THE KIND OF

01:01:39.896 --> 01:01:41.164
CAPACITY CRITERIA THAT THE

01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:43.666
OPPONENTS ARE SEEKING HERE. ALL

01:01:43.733 --> 01:01:45.768
OTHER STATES USE SOME VARIANT OF

01:01:45.835 --> 01:01:47.336
CALIFORNIA LAW, WHICH IS

01:01:47.403 --> 01:01:48.805
UNDERSTANDING THE NATURE OF THE

01:01:48.871 --> 01:01:50.006
ACT, ALTHOUGH THE OPPONENTS

01:01:50.073 --> 01:01:51.874
CLAIM THAT ESTABLISHING A

01:01:51.941 --> 01:01:53.042
DEFINITION OF CAPACITY IS

01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:55.244
DIFFERENT FROM CONSENT. IN FACT,

01:01:55.311 --> 01:01:58.214
THEY ARE ONE THING WITH ONE

01:01:58.281 --> 01:02:00.183
TEST. LACK OF CAPACITY MEANS

01:02:00.249 --> 01:02:02.051
INABILITY TO DO THE THINGS IN

01:02:02.118 --> 01:02:05.788
260 1.6 THAT ARE REQUIRED TO

01:02:05.855 --> 01:02:06.923
CONSENT, UNDERSTAND THE NATURE

01:02:06.989 --> 01:02:08.891
OF THE ACT OR TRANSACTION, AND

01:02:08.958 --> 01:02:11.694
ACT VOLUNTARILY. THE PROPER WAY

01:02:11.761 --> 01:02:13.296
TO HANDLE THIS IS WITH A

01:02:13.362 --> 01:02:15.731
DEFINITION IN 261. THERE IS NO

01:02:15.798 --> 01:02:17.500
REASON TO TOUCH THE OTHER

01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:18.901
STATUTE, SINCE THOSE LAWS DO NOT

01:02:18.968 --> 01:02:22.138
HAVE SPOUSAL RAPE EXCEPTIONS.

01:02:22.205 --> 01:02:23.239
PRESUMABLY THE REASON WE ARE

01:02:23.306 --> 01:02:24.707
ADDING SOME THINGS TO THE BILL

01:02:24.774 --> 01:02:26.542
IS THAT THEY ARE RESPONSIVE TO

01:02:26.609 --> 01:02:28.377
THE CONCERN WITH THE BILL.

01:02:28.444 --> 01:02:29.011
REGARDING THE EXCEPTION, THESE

01:02:29.078 --> 01:02:30.446
OTHER OFFENSES DO NOT HAVE SUCH

01:02:30.513 --> 01:02:32.281
AN EXEMPTION, SO THERE'S NO

01:02:32.348 --> 01:02:34.383
REASON TO TOUCH THEM. THIS IS,

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:36.619
AGAIN, A VERY NARROW AND TIGHT

01:02:36.686 --> 01:02:39.422
BILL SPECIFICALLY TO REMOVE THE

01:02:39.489 --> 01:02:41.924
SPOUSAL EXCEPTION IN RAPE.

01:02:41.991 --> 01:02:43.459
CALIFORNIA WOULD BE THE ONLY

01:02:43.526 --> 01:02:44.894
STATE WITH SUCH A LAW. SO THERE

01:02:44.961 --> 01:02:46.996
ARE NO MODELS WE CAN LOOK INTO

01:02:47.063 --> 01:02:48.464
IN ORDER TO SEE THEIR

01:02:48.531 --> 01:02:50.600
EXPERIENCES. SPOUSAL RAPE

01:02:50.666 --> 01:02:52.602
EXCEPTIONS ARE AN ARCHAIC LEGACY

01:02:52.668 --> 01:02:54.504
OF THE 17TH CENTURY ENGLISH

01:02:54.570 --> 01:02:56.372
COMMON LAW THAT HAVE NO PLACE IN

01:02:56.439 --> 01:02:58.674
MODERN PENAL CODE. WHATEVER

01:02:58.741 --> 01:02:59.876
PROBLEM THE OPPOSITION IS TRYING

01:02:59.942 --> 01:03:01.110
TO SOLVE, THE SPOUSAL RAPE

01:03:01.177 --> 01:03:04.580
EXCEPTION IS NOT THE ANSWER. AND

01:03:04.647 --> 01:03:07.550
I'M ALSO HAPPY TO SAY THAT WE.

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:09.585
THIS BILL CAME ABOUT FROM OUR

01:03:09.652 --> 01:03:11.821
DISTRICT, FROM INDIVIDUALS THAT

01:03:11.888 --> 01:03:13.956
ARE DISABLED, THAT WERE RAPED BY

01:03:14.023 --> 01:03:17.226
THEIR SPOUSE. THEY ARE TOO

01:03:17.293 --> 01:03:18.928
AFRAID TO COME UP AND TESTIFY.

01:03:18.995 --> 01:03:20.163
BUT THEY SHARED THEIR STORIES

01:03:20.229 --> 01:03:24.000
AND THEY TOLD ME TO MENTION THAT

01:03:24.066 --> 01:03:26.302
BECAUSE THESE ARE REAL LIFE

01:03:26.369 --> 01:03:27.770
PEOPLE WITH THESE EXPERIENCES

01:03:27.837 --> 01:03:29.872
THAT WERE NOT ABLE TO GO AFTER

01:03:29.939 --> 01:03:32.241
THEIR SPOUSE, THEY EVENTUALLY

01:03:32.308 --> 01:03:34.243
DIVORCED THEIR SPOUSE WITH A LOT

01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:35.912
OF HELP AND SUPPORT FROM

01:03:35.978 --> 01:03:38.181
COMMUNITY, BUT THEY WERE NOT

01:03:38.247 --> 01:03:39.916
ABLE TO GET THE JUSTICE THAT

01:03:39.982 --> 01:03:41.484
PEOPLE GET WHEN THEY'RE NOT

01:03:41.551 --> 01:03:43.486
MARRIED AND SOMEBODY RAPES THEM.

01:03:43.553 --> 01:03:46.455
EVERY SINGLE CASE LAW THAT WAS

01:03:46.522 --> 01:03:49.625
IN CONVERSATION WITH OPPOSITION

01:03:49.692 --> 01:03:52.428
ABOUT SPOUSAL RAPE AND ALL THE

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:53.663
POTENTIAL HARM THAT IT COULD DO

01:03:53.729 --> 01:03:56.098
IF WE REMOVE THIS EXEMPTION, IS

01:03:56.165 --> 01:03:57.900
NOT ACCURATE. EVERY SINGLE CASE

01:03:57.967 --> 01:04:00.436
LAW THAT THEY SHOWED WAS A

01:04:00.503 --> 01:04:02.438
PARATRANSIT DRIVER THAT RAPED

01:04:02.505 --> 01:04:06.475
THEIR CLIENT, WAS A CAREGIVER

01:04:06.542 --> 01:04:08.077
THAT RAPED THEIR CLIENT. AGAIN,

01:04:08.144 --> 01:04:10.546
NOTHING TO DO WITH MARRIAGE. AND

01:04:10.613 --> 01:04:13.115
WE HAVE PROFESSIONALS THAT HAVE

01:04:13.182 --> 01:04:16.085
WORKED AND CLEARLY SHOW THAT IN

01:04:16.152 --> 01:04:17.520
THE JUDGE'S DISCRETION AND MUCH

01:04:17.587 --> 01:04:20.189
MORE, THAT WE ARE, AGAIN, JUST

01:04:20.256 --> 01:04:23.526
TRYING TO PROVIDE MORE SUPPORT

01:04:23.593 --> 01:04:26.529
FOR VICTIMS IN MARRIAGES. THAT

01:04:26.596 --> 01:04:29.498
IS ALL. AND FOR THE LEGAL, YOU

01:04:29.565 --> 01:04:31.367
KNOW, ASPECT AND TECHNICAL

01:04:31.434 --> 01:04:33.202
DEFINITION, I'D LOVE TO DEFER TO

01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:36.038
MY WITNESS HERE. YES. GOOD

01:04:36.105 --> 01:04:40.176
MORNING. CALCRIM DEFINES THE

01:04:40.243 --> 01:04:42.578
ABILITY TO CONSENT IS THAT A

01:04:42.645 --> 01:04:45.381
PERSON MUST ACT FREELY AND

01:04:45.448 --> 01:04:47.216
VOLUNTARILY AND KNOW THE NATURE

01:04:47.283 --> 01:04:49.452
OF THE ACT, AND A PERSON MAY

01:04:49.518 --> 01:04:51.821
INITIALLY CONSENT AND THEY CAN

01:04:51.887 --> 01:04:56.325
WITHDRAW THEIR CONSENT. IF A

01:04:56.392 --> 01:04:59.762
SUSPECT OF A SEXUAL ASSAULT,

01:04:59.829 --> 01:05:02.031
REASONABLY AND OBJECTIVELY

01:05:02.098 --> 01:05:04.467
BELIEVES THAT THIS PERSON IS

01:05:04.533 --> 01:05:08.904
CONSENTING, THERE IS NO CRIME.

01:05:08.971 --> 01:05:13.509
SO THE LAW HAS BUILT IN ACROSS

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:16.646
MANY PENAL CODES THE DEFINITION

01:05:16.712 --> 01:05:18.581
OF CONSENT AND THE APPLICATION

01:05:18.648 --> 01:05:20.316
OF CONSENT, AND BUILT IN

01:05:20.383 --> 01:05:22.952
PROTECTIONS FOR THOSE WHO ARE

01:05:23.019 --> 01:05:25.421
ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. AND

01:05:25.488 --> 01:05:27.857
THE LAW LOOKS AT WHAT WERE THE

01:05:27.923 --> 01:05:29.825
NATURE AND CIRCUMSTANCES, WHAT

01:05:29.892 --> 01:05:32.662
WAS GOING ON THAT DAY, WHAT DID

01:05:32.728 --> 01:05:35.131
THAT INCIDENT ENTAIL? WHAT

01:05:35.197 --> 01:05:36.132
HAPPENED TO THAT VICTIM? WHAT

01:05:36.198 --> 01:05:38.434
WAS SAID? WHAT DID SHE DO? WHAT

01:05:38.501 --> 01:05:40.136
DID HE DO? I'M ASSUMING THESE

01:05:40.202 --> 01:05:44.907
ARE NOT SAME SEX COUPLES. FOR

01:05:44.974 --> 01:05:46.976
PURPOSES OF THIS HYPOTHETICAL.

01:05:47.043 --> 01:05:52.048
AND THE LAW WILL ALSO LOOK AT IF

01:05:52.114 --> 01:05:53.449
SOMEONE HAS A DISABILITY. HOW

01:05:53.516 --> 01:05:56.385
DID THAT DISABILITY AFFECT THAT

01:05:56.452 --> 01:05:58.921
PERSON IN THAT MOMENT? THERE ARE

01:05:58.988 --> 01:06:02.825
NO LABELS THAT ARE PERMANENT,

01:06:02.892 --> 01:06:05.394
AND THE OPPOSITION HAS EXPRESSED

01:06:05.461 --> 01:06:07.863
NUMEROUS TIMES TO US A CONCERN

01:06:07.930 --> 01:06:10.833
THAT A THIRD PARTY OR A FAMILY

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:14.103
MEMBER OF THE ID INDIVIDUAL WILL

01:06:14.170 --> 01:06:16.539
HAVE STRONG FEELINGS LIKE THIS

01:06:16.605 --> 01:06:18.341
PERSON SHOULD NOT BE ENGAGING IN

01:06:18.407 --> 01:06:20.142
IN SEX, THIS IS WRONG AND

01:06:20.209 --> 01:06:21.777
THEREFORE THAT PERSON HAS TAKEN

01:06:21.844 --> 01:06:24.180
ADVANTAGE OF THEM AND THEY MUST

01:06:24.246 --> 01:06:27.149
BE PUNISHED. AND THERE THEY

01:06:27.216 --> 01:06:28.751
VOICED A CONCERN THAT THAT

01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:30.353
SCENARIO IS GOING TO LEAD TO A

01:06:30.419 --> 01:06:31.587
PROSECUTION. BUT THAT'S NOT HOW

01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:34.757
IT WORKS. WE DON'T HAVE SOMEONE

01:06:34.824 --> 01:06:36.325
COME OFF THE STREET AND SAY,

01:06:36.392 --> 01:06:37.660
HEY, I WANT THE PERSON WHO'S

01:06:37.727 --> 01:06:39.495
DATING MY DAUGHTER TO BE CHARGED

01:06:39.562 --> 01:06:42.231
WITH RAPE BECAUSE SHE'S ID, AND

01:06:42.298 --> 01:06:43.966
THEN THAT PERSON IS CHARGED WITH

01:06:44.033 --> 01:06:45.501
RAPE. THAT'S JUST NOT HOW IT

01:06:45.568 --> 01:06:47.737
WORKS. WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT

01:06:47.803 --> 01:06:49.772
HAPPENED IN THAT INCIDENT. WHAT

01:06:49.839 --> 01:06:52.742
IS THAT PERSON WITH THE ID?

01:06:52.808 --> 01:06:56.712
ALLEGED? ID SAY WHAT WAS THEIR

01:06:56.779 --> 01:06:58.114
EXPERIENCE? WHAT DO THEY WANT TO

01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:03.586
HAVE HAPPEN? SO THE BELIEF THAT

01:07:03.652 --> 01:07:07.256
THIS LAW WILL HARM PEOPLE IS

01:07:07.323 --> 01:07:10.493
REALLY ABSURD. MORE PEOPLE WILL

01:07:10.559 --> 01:07:13.162
BE HARMED BY NOT GETTING RID OF

01:07:13.229 --> 01:07:17.266
THIS LOOPHOLE. THIS LOOPHOLE

01:07:17.333 --> 01:07:20.069
LEGALIZES RAPE. AND UNDER NO

01:07:20.136 --> 01:07:23.739
SCENARIO IS THAT OKAY? NO, I

01:07:23.806 --> 01:07:24.840
DON'T THINK ANYBODY HERE IS

01:07:24.907 --> 01:07:27.676
TRYING TO DEFEND THE RAPIST. I

01:07:27.743 --> 01:07:29.278
THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS

01:07:29.345 --> 01:07:32.648
DEFINE THE WILLING, CONSENTING

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:34.483
AND HAVING THAT BEING

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:36.352
MISINTERPRETED AS BECAUSE THEY

01:07:36.419 --> 01:07:38.154
HAVE A DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY,

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:39.288
THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE

01:07:39.355 --> 01:07:40.990
CAPACITY TO CONSENT. I THINK

01:07:41.056 --> 01:07:42.525
THAT'S CLEARLY A CONCERN BECAUSE

01:07:42.591 --> 01:07:44.427
WE HAD I KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT A

01:07:44.493 --> 01:07:47.963
NEW CONCERN. ON MAY 23RD, WHEN

01:07:48.030 --> 01:07:48.831
YOU HAD THE SENATE PUBLIC SAFETY

01:07:48.898 --> 01:07:51.000
HEARING. I KNOW SENATOR WIENER

01:07:51.066 --> 01:07:53.536
ASKED IF YOU WOULD WORK WITH OUR

01:07:53.602 --> 01:07:56.005
OPPONENTS HERE IN THE DISABILITY

01:07:56.071 --> 01:07:57.706
COMMUNITY. AND I'VE BEEN TOLD

01:07:57.773 --> 01:07:59.108
SINCE THAT TIME YOU'VE HAD ONE

01:07:59.175 --> 01:08:01.911
MEETING AND THEY PROPOSED

01:08:01.977 --> 01:08:03.412
AMENDMENTS, ESPECIALLY THE ONE

01:08:03.479 --> 01:08:04.680
LISTED IN THE SMART JUSTICE

01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:07.383
OPPOSITION LETTER. AND IS THERE

01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:09.985
A SPECIFIC REASON YOU COULD HELP

01:08:10.052 --> 01:08:10.619
US UNDERSTAND WHY YOU REJECTED

01:08:10.686 --> 01:08:12.755
THAT AMENDMENT? YES. SO IT'S NOT

01:08:12.822 --> 01:08:15.124
EXACTLY ACCURATE. WE HAVE BEEN

01:08:15.191 --> 01:08:17.827
HAVING CONVERSATIONS LONG TERM,

01:08:17.893 --> 01:08:19.562
AND WE HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS

01:08:19.628 --> 01:08:24.166
EVEN BEFORE THE SENATE HEARING.

01:08:24.233 --> 01:08:26.235
FIRST AND FOREMOST, YOU KNOW, WE

01:08:26.302 --> 01:08:27.803
HAD WE ASKED FOR AMENDMENTS

01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:30.372
EARLY ON IN THE SENATE AND WE

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:32.575
WERE MET WITH, WE DON'T WANT TO

01:08:32.641 --> 01:08:33.776
GIVE AMENDMENTS. WE'RE GOING TO

01:08:33.843 --> 01:08:36.412
BE IN OPPOSITION. THEN IT CAME

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:37.646
BACK THAT IT WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY

01:08:37.713 --> 01:08:39.782
AND ASKED FOR THINGS THAT WERE

01:08:39.849 --> 01:08:40.883
PATENTLY UNREASONABLE, INCLUDING

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:43.252
SEX ED THAT WAS ASKED, THIS IS

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:45.421
NOT A SEX ED BILL. THIS IS

01:08:45.488 --> 01:08:47.623
PURELY REMOVE SPOUSAL RAPE

01:08:47.690 --> 01:08:50.092
EXCEPTIONS. RIGHT? WE PROVIDED A

01:08:50.159 --> 01:08:51.427
COUNTER PROPOSAL THAT ADDRESSED

01:08:51.494 --> 01:08:53.062
ALL OF THE CONCERNS THEY HAD

01:08:53.128 --> 01:08:54.463
PREVIOUSLY RAISED, EXPLAINING

01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:55.564
WHY WE COULDN'T ACCEPT

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:56.632
AMENDMENTS THEY OFFERED. THEY

01:08:56.699 --> 01:08:58.701
WERE TOO BROAD AND ENORMOUS

01:08:58.767 --> 01:08:59.969
POTENTIAL TO CAUSE EVEN MORE

01:09:00.035 --> 01:09:02.037
WIDE RANGING UNINTENDED

01:09:02.104 --> 01:09:04.173
CONSEQUENCES. MIND YOU, WE HAVE

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:05.608
MULTIPLE LAWYERS THAT SUPPORT

01:09:05.674 --> 01:09:07.610
THIS BILL, INCLUDING STANFORD

01:09:07.676 --> 01:09:10.980
LAW PROFESSORS AND MUCH MORE. IN

01:09:11.046 --> 01:09:14.216
RESPONSE TO OUR OFFER, DRC

01:09:14.283 --> 01:09:16.018
SPECIFICALLY TOLD US, AND THERE

01:09:16.085 --> 01:09:19.188
IS CLEAR, YOU KNOW, TRACK RECORD

01:09:19.255 --> 01:09:22.157
HERE, THAT THEY WERE NO LONGER

01:09:22.224 --> 01:09:23.559
INTERESTED IN ENGAGING IN

01:09:23.626 --> 01:09:24.660
AMENDMENTS WHEN WE SAID THAT WE

01:09:24.727 --> 01:09:26.829
WILL NOT PUT A SEX ED BILL INTO

01:09:26.896 --> 01:09:28.330
THIS PARTICULAR PIECE, AND THAT

01:09:28.397 --> 01:09:30.432
WAS ONE OF THE MANY ITEMS THAT

01:09:30.499 --> 01:09:34.270
THEY ASKED FOR. WE WERE ALSO

01:09:34.336 --> 01:09:36.572
TOLD THAT, YOU KNOW, IN THE

01:09:36.639 --> 01:09:37.506
COUNTER PROPOSALS, THE BACK AND

01:09:37.573 --> 01:09:40.543
FORTH, THAT TO CREATE A CAPACITY

01:09:40.609 --> 01:09:41.944
DEFINITION, WHICH WE EXPLAINED

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:44.146
WHY WE CANNOT CREATE A CAPACITY

01:09:44.213 --> 01:09:46.649
DEFINITION, OUR LEGAL EXPERTS

01:09:46.715 --> 01:09:47.850
EXHAUSTIVELY SEARCHED OTHER

01:09:47.917 --> 01:09:49.485
STATES PENAL CODES ASKING FOR

01:09:49.552 --> 01:09:51.287
ANYTHING SIMILAR AND WERE UNABLE

01:09:51.353 --> 01:09:53.522
TO COME UP WITH ANYTHING IN ALL

01:09:53.589 --> 01:09:56.759
50 STATES. WE ASKED FOR SMART

01:09:56.825 --> 01:09:58.594
JUSTICE TO PROVIDE EXAMPLES OF

01:09:58.661 --> 01:09:59.929
OTHER STATES WITH SIMILAR

01:09:59.995 --> 01:10:01.096
LANGUAGE, AND THERE WAS NO

01:10:01.163 --> 01:10:03.566
RESPONSE TO THAT AS WELL. SO

01:10:03.632 --> 01:10:05.701
WHEN WE WERE MET WITH WE ARE NO

01:10:05.768 --> 01:10:07.303
LONGER INTERESTED IN ENGAGING,

01:10:07.369 --> 01:10:08.571
YOU KNOW, WE CONTINUED MOVING

01:10:08.637 --> 01:10:10.673
THE BILL FORWARD. MR. LACKEY,

01:10:10.739 --> 01:10:12.641
I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOUR LINE

01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:13.309
OF QUESTIONING. I WILL NOTE THAT

01:10:13.375 --> 01:10:14.610
OUR SECOND OPPOSITION WITNESS

01:10:14.677 --> 01:10:16.545
DID ARRIVE ON YOUR BEST

01:10:16.612 --> 01:10:18.113
AVAILABLE TIME AT THE CHAIR'S

01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:19.882
DISCRETION. I'M GOING TO GO OUT

01:10:19.949 --> 01:10:20.749
OF ORDER. ALLOW HER TO PRESENT

01:10:20.816 --> 01:10:22.017
HER TESTIMONY FOR 2.5 MINUTES.

01:10:22.084 --> 01:10:23.919
I'LL THEN TURN IT BACK TO YOU,

01:10:23.986 --> 01:10:25.721
MR. LACKEY. THAT'S FINE. HI.

01:10:25.788 --> 01:10:28.424
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR

01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:30.659
GRACE. MY NAME IS CAROLYN

01:10:30.726 --> 01:10:32.728
GEHRIG, AND I AM THE DISABLED

01:10:32.795 --> 01:10:34.797
SURVIVOR OF SPOUSAL RAPE WHO MET

01:10:34.863 --> 01:10:36.398
WITH MANY OF YOUR STAFF THIS

01:10:36.465 --> 01:10:38.167
SPRING WHILE WORKING WITH

01:10:38.233 --> 01:10:40.302
SENATOR DOCTOR WAHHAB'S OFFICE

01:10:40.369 --> 01:10:43.238
AND THE NCPC TO TELL PART OF MY

01:10:43.305 --> 01:10:45.874
STORY AND ASK YOU TO SIGN ON IN

01:10:45.941 --> 01:10:51.814
SUPPORT OF SB 258. IT IS

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:54.016
OBVIOUSLY VERY STRANGE, OR

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:54.950
SHOULD BE VERY STRANGE THAT I'M

01:10:55.017 --> 01:10:56.719
HERE NOW ASKING YOU TO OPPOSE

01:10:56.785 --> 01:11:01.590
IT. SO I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN WHY.

01:11:01.657 --> 01:11:04.893
IN FEBRUARY OF 2018, I WROTE AN

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:06.128
ESSAY CALLED TIME'S UP FOR ME

01:11:06.195 --> 01:11:08.697
TOO. IT IS WIDELY AVAILABLE AND

01:11:08.764 --> 01:11:11.000
AS OF THIS MORNING IT WAS EVEN

01:11:11.066 --> 01:11:14.103
POSTED ON SB 258. ORG'S WEBSITE.

01:11:14.169 --> 01:11:15.137
IT'S TAUGHT IN DISABILITY

01:11:15.204 --> 01:11:19.475
STUDIES CLASSES WORLDWIDE, AND

01:11:19.541 --> 01:11:21.243
IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR, I WAS

01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:23.278
CONTACTED BY THE SENATOR'S

01:11:23.345 --> 01:11:24.613
OFFICE AND A REPRESENTATIVE OF

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:26.715
THE NCPC BECAUSE THEY HAD READ

01:11:26.782 --> 01:11:28.283
THAT ESSAY AND WANTED ME TO

01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:30.686
TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THE BILL. I

01:11:30.753 --> 01:11:31.253
SAID YES IMMEDIATELY. YES,

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.655
BECAUSE WHO WANTS A LOOPHOLE IN

01:11:32.721 --> 01:11:34.289
A RAPE LAW, ESPECIALLY ONE THAT

01:11:34.356 --> 01:11:35.624
IMPACTS THE OTHER DISABLED

01:11:35.691 --> 01:11:38.260
PEOPLE? THAT ESSAY EXPLORED

01:11:38.327 --> 01:11:39.261
DISABILITY, SPOUSAL RAPE,

01:11:39.328 --> 01:11:40.796
LATERAL ABLEISM AND OUR

01:11:40.863 --> 01:11:43.198
EXCLUSION FROM REPRESENTATION.

01:11:43.265 --> 01:11:45.100
IN THAT BILL. I MENTIONED, IT

01:11:45.167 --> 01:11:46.435
WAS FOCUSED ON MEDIA

01:11:46.502 --> 01:11:48.303
REPRESENTATION, BUT REALLY IT'S

01:11:48.370 --> 01:11:51.273
ABOUT REPRESENTATION EVERYWHERE.

01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:53.742
MORE SPECIFICALLY, I WROTE ABOUT

01:11:53.809 --> 01:11:54.476
MY EX-HUSBAND, WHO REPEATEDLY

01:11:54.543 --> 01:11:55.911
TOOK ADVANTAGE OF MY

01:11:55.978 --> 01:11:57.279
DISABILITIES TO RAPE ME OVER THE

01:11:57.346 --> 01:11:58.981
COURSE OF OUR MARRIAGE,

01:11:59.048 --> 01:12:00.482
DOCUMENTED IT EXTENSIVELY, AND

01:12:00.549 --> 01:12:02.151
CONFESSED IT TO THE LAPD BEFORE

01:12:02.217 --> 01:12:04.119
THE DA TOLD ME HE WOULD NOT BE

01:12:04.186 --> 01:12:05.921
PROSECUTED. IT'S BEEN 14 YEARS

01:12:05.988 --> 01:12:07.322
SINCE THAT HAPPENED, AND I STILL

01:12:07.389 --> 01:12:09.058
HAVE THE CHARGE SHEET. EVERY

01:12:09.124 --> 01:12:13.028
TIME THE ESSAY IS PUBLISHED OR

01:12:13.095 --> 01:12:14.897
REPRINTED, I RECEIVE DMS FROM

01:12:14.963 --> 01:12:16.498
PEOPLE DISCLOSING THEIR OWN

01:12:16.565 --> 01:12:17.866
ASSAULTS. I ALSO RECEIVED

01:12:17.933 --> 01:12:19.234
THREATS, STALKING AND

01:12:19.301 --> 01:12:21.236
HARASSMENT. IT IS NOT. I PUT

01:12:21.303 --> 01:12:23.605
MYSELF AT RISK TO BE HERE JUST

01:12:23.672 --> 01:12:25.441
TO BE OPEN ABOUT THAT. EARLIER

01:12:25.507 --> 01:12:27.276
THIS SPRING, AS I SPOKE WITH

01:12:27.342 --> 01:12:28.377
STAFF FROM NEARLY ALL OF THE

01:12:28.444 --> 01:12:29.678
MEMBERS OF THE SENATE PUBLIC

01:12:29.745 --> 01:12:31.146
SAFETY COMMITTEE OVER ZOOM,

01:12:31.213 --> 01:12:32.614
IDENTIFYING MYSELF AS A DISABLED

01:12:32.681 --> 01:12:35.284
ADVOCATE AND SURVIVOR. 30S.

01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:39.888
OKAY. SORRY. I'LL GO. I'LL JUST

01:12:39.955 --> 01:12:42.658
SKIP AHEAD. LATE THIS SPRING, I

01:12:42.725 --> 01:12:43.592
LEARNED THAT THE BILL WOULD NOT

01:12:43.659 --> 01:12:45.661
FIX THE LOOPHOLE CREATED BY ITS

01:12:45.728 --> 01:12:46.562
PARENT BILL WITHOUT REMOVING THE

01:12:46.628 --> 01:12:48.497
CIVIL LIBERTIES OF PART OF THE

01:12:48.564 --> 01:12:49.298
DISABILITY COMMUNITY. THIS IS

01:12:49.364 --> 01:12:51.467
NOT A BILL THAT CAN BE WHOLLY

01:12:51.533 --> 01:12:53.135
FIXED BY AMENDMENTS, BECAUSE THE

01:12:53.202 --> 01:12:53.736
LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWS FOR THE

01:12:53.802 --> 01:12:55.237
DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES IS

01:12:55.304 --> 01:12:56.338
HOUSED IN ANOTHER PART OF THE

01:12:56.405 --> 01:12:57.773
STATE LAW TO CREATE ANOTHER BILL

01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:58.907
TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES CREATED BY

01:12:58.974 --> 01:13:00.943
THIS ONE WOULD BE AN UNNECESSARY

01:13:01.009 --> 01:13:02.478
HERCULEAN TASK. AT THIS TIME, I

01:13:02.544 --> 01:13:03.512
WAS ALSO TOLD I WOULD NOT BE

01:13:03.579 --> 01:13:05.314
NEEDED TO TESTIFY BACK TO THE

01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:07.015
ESSAY. IN THAT ESSAY, I ALSO

01:13:07.082 --> 01:13:08.050
WROTE ABOUT MY INTELLECTUALLY

01:13:08.117 --> 01:13:09.651
AND DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED

01:13:09.718 --> 01:13:10.919
AUNT, WHO EXPERIENCED MULTIPLE

01:13:10.986 --> 01:13:13.255
SEXUAL ASSAULTS AT HER SHELTERED

01:13:13.322 --> 01:13:15.157
WORKSHOP AND DAY CENTERS. I

01:13:15.224 --> 01:13:17.025
WROTE ABOUT HER ENTHUSIASTIC

01:13:17.092 --> 01:13:18.026
EXPRESSION OF ROMANTIC DESIRE

01:13:18.093 --> 01:13:19.595
AND HOW HARD IT WAS TO

01:13:19.661 --> 01:13:21.096
UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING. I'M SORRY

01:13:21.163 --> 01:13:23.031
THAT WE'RE AT TIME. I'LL GIVE

01:13:23.098 --> 01:13:24.600
YOU A SENTENCE TO WRAP UP, BUT

01:13:24.666 --> 01:13:26.635
WE'RE AT TIME, OKAY? I SHOULDN'T

01:13:26.702 --> 01:13:27.703
HAVE TO POINT OUT THAT IT'S

01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:29.905
WRONG TO GIVE NOMINAL JUSTICE TO

01:13:29.972 --> 01:13:30.906
SOME OF THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY

01:13:30.973 --> 01:13:32.307
AT THE EXPENSE OF DISABLED

01:13:32.374 --> 01:13:33.642
PEOPLE WHOSE FREEDOMS SEEM LESS

01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:36.645
VALUABLE. THIS BILL IS SUPPORTED

01:13:36.712 --> 01:13:39.248
BY DISABLED PEOPLE, IS OPPOSED

01:13:39.314 --> 01:13:40.449
BY DISABLED PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN

01:13:40.516 --> 01:13:42.484
ACTIVE IN THE COMMUNITY FOR A

01:13:42.551 --> 01:13:43.819
LONG TIME, AND THIS BILL WOULD

01:13:43.886 --> 01:13:46.221
NOT LIKELY HAVE CHANGED THE

01:13:46.288 --> 01:13:47.322
OUTCOME OF MY CASE IF IT

01:13:47.389 --> 01:13:49.324
OCCURRED TODAY. I'M GOING TO I'M

01:13:49.391 --> 01:13:50.726
GOING TO STOP YOU RIGHT THERE.

01:13:50.793 --> 01:13:52.461
WE KNOW IT'S OKAY. WE MAY HAVE

01:13:52.528 --> 01:13:53.862
MORE QUESTIONS FOR YOU. I JUST

01:13:53.929 --> 01:13:55.497
ON A PERSONAL NOTE, WANT TO

01:13:55.564 --> 01:13:57.366
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY.

01:13:57.432 --> 01:13:58.400
THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO

01:13:58.467 --> 01:14:00.602
COME UP HERE. I CANNOT IMAGINE

01:14:00.669 --> 01:14:01.370
THAT TELLING YOUR STORY GETS ANY

01:14:01.436 --> 01:14:03.338
EASIER WITH TIME. AND I WANT YOU

01:14:03.405 --> 01:14:05.174
TO KNOW THAT WE APPRECIATE ALL

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:06.675
OF US. APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE

01:14:06.742 --> 01:14:08.377
TO BE PART OF THIS IMPORTANT

01:14:08.443 --> 01:14:09.378
CONVERSATION. SO THANK YOU. WE

01:14:09.444 --> 01:14:10.612
MAY HAVE MORE QUESTIONS, BUT

01:14:10.679 --> 01:14:12.414
WITH THAT, MR. LACKEY, I WANT TO

01:14:12.481 --> 01:14:14.183
TURN IT BACK TO YOU. WELL THANK

01:14:14.249 --> 01:14:16.518
YOU. I THINK THAT THAT WITNESSES

01:14:16.585 --> 01:14:17.152
WITNESS SHOWS HOW COMPLEX THIS

01:14:17.219 --> 01:14:20.622
ISSUE IS. AND WE NEED TO REALLY

01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:22.791
FOCUS ON THIS CONCERN ABOUT THE

01:14:22.858 --> 01:14:26.328
CAPACITY TO CONSENT, BECAUSE I

01:14:26.395 --> 01:14:27.462
DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYBODY UP

01:14:27.529 --> 01:14:30.132
HERE THAT SUPPORTS RAPE. RAPE IS

01:14:30.199 --> 01:14:33.268
CLEARLY AN UNACCEPTABLE PATHWAY.

01:14:33.335 --> 01:14:35.971
BUT WHAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IS

01:14:36.038 --> 01:14:38.340
THAT IT'S NOT CHARGED WHEN IT

01:14:38.407 --> 01:14:41.009
SHOULDN'T BE. AND WHEN THERE IS

01:14:41.076 --> 01:14:43.345
CONSENT, IT NEEDS TO BE SEEN AS

01:14:43.412 --> 01:14:44.713
SUCH. BUT WHEN IT'S NOT, IT

01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:49.785
NEEDS TO BE SEEN AS NOT. AND

01:14:49.852 --> 01:14:50.619
ALTHOUGH THAT SOUNDS VERY SIMPLE

01:14:50.686 --> 01:14:53.755
WHEN YOU HAVE. A CHALLENGE IN

01:14:53.822 --> 01:14:56.592
HOW TO COMMUNICATE, THAT BECOMES

01:14:56.658 --> 01:15:00.596
VERY, VERY COMPLEX. AND SO I,

01:15:00.662 --> 01:15:01.830
I'M CLEARLY GOING TO SUPPORT

01:15:01.897 --> 01:15:03.565
THIS TODAY BECAUSE I NEED TO

01:15:03.632 --> 01:15:05.701
SEND THE MESSAGE THAT RAPE IS

01:15:05.767 --> 01:15:08.103
NEVER ACCEPTABLE, EVER. BUT I

01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:09.905
WISH AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL

01:15:09.972 --> 01:15:12.541
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE

01:15:12.608 --> 01:15:13.575
OPPOSITION TO HELP THEM

01:15:13.642 --> 01:15:15.043
UNDERSTAND IT. THAT'S WHAT YOUR

01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:16.511
INTENTION AND WHAT THE OUTCOME

01:15:16.578 --> 01:15:19.548
WILL BE OF YOUR PROPOSAL. AND

01:15:19.615 --> 01:15:21.884
WITH THAT, I'M DONE. THANK YOU

01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:23.252
VERY MUCH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:15:23.318 --> 01:15:24.486
LACKEY, WOULD ANYONE ELSE LIKE

01:15:24.553 --> 01:15:26.321
TO GO FORWARD WITH A QUESTION OR

01:15:26.388 --> 01:15:28.257
COMMENT FROM THE DAIS? MR. VICE

01:15:28.323 --> 01:15:29.925
CHAIR, MAKE THIS REAL QUICK. MR.

01:15:29.992 --> 01:15:33.295
CHAIR. THANK YOU. AS PROBABLY

01:15:33.362 --> 01:15:34.496
FEW MEMBERS WHO CAN ACTUALLY SAY

01:15:34.563 --> 01:15:35.797
THEY'VE WORKED ON RAPE CASES

01:15:35.864 --> 01:15:37.366
HERE IN THIS BUILDING, IT IS

01:15:37.432 --> 01:15:38.600
HARD TO PROVE AND AN

01:15:38.667 --> 01:15:40.602
INVESTIGATION DOES NEED TO BE

01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:41.803
DONE. AND IT'S IN THE HANDS OF

01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:42.738
THE INVESTIGATORS, DISTRICT

01:15:42.804 --> 01:15:44.506
ATTORNEYS ALSO TO PROVE ALL THAT

01:15:44.573 --> 01:15:45.707
AND THE BURDENS AND EVERYTHING

01:15:45.774 --> 01:15:47.442
ELSE THAT GO ALONG WITH IT. SO I

01:15:47.509 --> 01:15:48.777
WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING

01:15:48.844 --> 01:15:50.612
THIS ALONG AS WELL. AND I WILL

01:15:50.679 --> 01:15:52.547
BE MOVING THE BILL. WE HAVE A

01:15:52.614 --> 01:15:53.749
MOTION. IS THERE A SECOND? OKAY.

01:15:53.815 --> 01:15:56.351

ELSE? ARE WE ALLOWED? NO, ONLY

01:16:06.261 --> 01:16:07.396
IF A QUESTION IS POSED. I'M

01:16:07.462 --> 01:16:09.364
SORRY. IF WITH NO OTHER

01:16:09.431 --> 01:16:10.799
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE

01:16:10.866 --> 01:16:13.568

AS FORMER CHAIR OF PUBLIC

01:16:31.019 --> 01:16:32.688
SAFETY, SEXUAL ASSAULT CRIMES

01:16:32.754 --> 01:16:33.889
ARE ONE OF THE WORST. THAT

01:16:33.956 --> 01:16:36.024
LEAVES A MARK FOR A LIFETIME ON

01:16:36.091 --> 01:16:39.294
AN INDIVIDUAL AND WHAT WE ARE

01:16:39.361 --> 01:16:41.396

YOU, MISTER CHAIR. AND MEMBERS,

01:18:38.647 --> 01:18:40.649
I'M GOING TO TRY TO MODEL

01:18:40.715 --> 01:18:41.283
BEHAVIOR BECAUSE SENATE

BILL. SB 398 CLOSE A LOOPHOLE,

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:53.795
MAKING IT A CRIME FOR A PERSON

01:18:53.862 --> 01:18:54.796

01:18:54.863 --> 01:18:57.532
OFFER TO PAY OTHER VALUABLE

MORNING, CHAIR AND MEMBERS.

01:19:09.444 --> 01:19:10.712
PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:19:10.779 --> 01:19:11.379
CLEAN MONEY CAMPAIGN. WE'RE

SENATOR UMBERG AND THE

01:19:16.518 --> 01:19:16.918
COMMITTEE. ONE OF THE

01:19:16.985 --> 01:19:18.320
CORNERSTONES OF OUR DEMOCRACY IS

01:19:18.386 --> 01:19:19.588
THE PRINCIPLE THAT NO ONE SHOULD

01:19:19.654 --> 01:19:21.323
BE ALLOWED TO BUY VOTES. THERE

01:19:21.389 --> 01:19:24.025
CURRENTLY IS A LOOPHOLE TO OFFER

01:19:24.092 --> 01:19:25.694
CASH AND LOTTERIES, AS LONG AS

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:27.696
PEOPLE DO NOT EXPLICITLY ASK TO

01:19:27.762 --> 01:19:29.464
VOTE. THIS BILL CLOSES THOSE

01:19:29.531 --> 01:19:30.465
LOOPHOLES, SO WE RESPECTFULLY

01:19:30.532 --> 01:19:32.434
REQUEST YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU.

01:19:32.501 --> 01:19:33.602
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU BOTH. I

01:19:33.668 --> 01:19:34.669
THINK THAT'S RECORD TIME,

01:19:34.736 --> 01:19:38.206
SENATOR. NICELY DONE. ME TOO IS

01:19:38.273 --> 01:19:40.142
NEXT. IF YOU'RE IN SUPPORT OF

01:19:40.208 --> 01:19:41.276
THE BILL, COME FORWARD AT THIS

01:19:41.343 --> 01:19:42.677
TIME. SEEING NO ONE. ANYONE HERE

01:19:42.744 --> 01:19:44.846
TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THE

01:19:44.913 --> 01:19:47.616
BILL. ANY SHOW OF HANDS? NO. ANY

01:19:47.682 --> 01:19:50.252
OTHER ME TOOS? WE HAVE ONE.

01:19:50.318 --> 01:19:59.327
OKAY. YES. COME ON DOWN. I'LL BE

01:19:59.394 --> 01:20:01.496
QUICK. MY NAME IS DAVE APOLOGUE.

01:20:01.563 --> 01:20:03.999
I NOTICED THAT THE LEGISLATION.

01:20:04.065 --> 01:20:05.534
LEGISLATORS HAVE TRIED IN VAIN

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:07.269
TO TRY TO GET PEOPLE TO COME OUT

01:20:07.335 --> 01:20:09.804
AND VOTE. MORE AND MORE, I

01:20:09.871 --> 01:20:12.374
QUESTION, THOUGH, IF THIS WAS

01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:14.776
DONE BY ANOTHER PERSON WHO

01:20:14.843 --> 01:20:15.977
SUPPORTS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY,

01:20:16.044 --> 01:20:20.282
SUCH AS SOROS, A ONE OF THE

01:20:20.348 --> 01:20:22.017
TRIBES, OR THE PRITZKERS. IF THE

01:20:22.083 --> 01:20:23.685
SENATOR WOULD HAVE HAD A PROBLEM

01:20:23.752 --> 01:20:25.453
WITH THIS, OR IF IT WAS DONE IN

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:27.455
SUPPORT OF HIS FORMER SEATMATE

01:20:27.522 --> 01:20:28.590
WHO HAS JUST BEEN ON HIS HIS

01:20:28.657 --> 01:20:31.860
PODCAST RECENTLY. SO THAT'S MY

01:20:31.927 --> 01:20:32.827
QUESTION. WOULD THIS ACTUALLY

01:20:32.894 --> 01:20:33.828
HAVE HAPPENED IF IT WAS SOMEBODY

01:20:33.895 --> 01:20:35.630
FROM THE OTHER PARTY TO TRY TO

01:20:35.697 --> 01:20:37.332
GET PEOPLE TO COME OUT AND VOTE?

01:20:37.399 --> 01:20:38.800
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, I JUST

01:20:38.867 --> 01:20:40.802
WANT TO SAY TO SENATOR UMBERG,

01:20:40.869 --> 01:20:42.003
IT'S IMPORTANT TO LISTEN TO YOUR

01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.671
CONSTITUENTS. YOU'VE HAD PEOPLE

01:20:42.737 --> 01:20:44.606

01:20:44.673 --> 01:20:45.540

TREAT THAT AS OPPOSITION

01:20:53.949 --> 01:20:55.450
TESTIMONY. ANYONE ELSE HOPING TO

01:20:55.517 --> 01:20:56.585
BE HEARD ON THE BILL? OKAY,

01:20:56.651 --> 01:20:58.954
WE'LL TURN IT BACK TO THE DAIS.

01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:00.689
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS? A SECOND

01:21:00.755 --> 01:21:01.556
MOTION BY NGUYEN. I THINK I

01:21:01.623 --> 01:21:02.691
HEARD THE SECOND FROM DOCTOR

01:21:02.757 --> 01:21:04.726
SHARPE. COLLINS. SENATOR UMBERG

WILL GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO CLOSE.

01:21:07.295 --> 01:21:08.163
THANK YOU. THE OPPOSITION IS.

01:21:08.230 --> 01:21:11.399
YES. I HAD NO DOUBT. AND WITH

01:21:11.466 --> 01:21:12.901
THAT, SENATOR UMBERG, I AM

01:21:12.968 --> 01:21:13.468
RECOMMENDING AN AYE WITH A

01:21:13.535 --> 01:21:15.036
MOTION. AND SECOND, LET'S CALL

01:21:15.103 --> 01:21:17.072
THE ROLL ON SENATE BILL 398 BY

01:21:17.138 --> 01:21:18.506
SENATOR UMBERG. THE MOTION IS

01:21:18.573 --> 01:21:20.242
DUE PASSED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS

01:21:20.308 --> 01:21:21.509
COMMITTEE. SCHULTZ. SCHULTZ.

01:21:21.576 --> 01:21:23.979
AYE. ALANIZ. ALANIZ. AYE.

01:21:24.045 --> 01:21:26.781
GONZALEZ. HANEY. HARVARDIAN.

01:21:26.848 --> 01:21:29.384
LACKEY. LACKEY I NGUYEN NGUYEN

01:21:29.451 --> 01:21:31.853

OKAY. THAT BILLS OUT REMAINS ON

01:21:36.625 --> 01:21:38.126
CALL. THANK YOU. SENATOR. WOULD

01:21:38.193 --> 01:21:40.929
YOU LIKE TO GO TO ITEM 1 OR 2

01:21:40.996 --> 01:21:44.132
NEXT SB 27 I'M NOT SURE THAT IS

01:21:44.199 --> 01:21:46.034
THAT IS ITEM NUMBER ONE TO MY

01:21:46.101 --> 01:21:47.669
COLLEAGUES. SENATE BILL 27 BY

01:21:47.736 --> 01:21:49.004
SENATOR UMBERG. WHEN YOU'RE

01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:50.305
READY, SENATOR, FIVE MINUTES FOR

01:21:50.372 --> 01:21:51.506
YOU AND FOR YOUR WITNESSES.

01:21:51.573 --> 01:21:54.209
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. CHAIR.

01:21:54.276 --> 01:21:55.310
AND THANK YOU TO MISS CHOI FOR

01:21:55.377 --> 01:21:58.813
YOUR HELP ON THIS MEASURE. CARE

01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:00.649
COURT WAS ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED

01:22:00.715 --> 01:22:04.319
SEVERAL YEARS AGO AT THE

01:22:04.386 --> 01:22:05.754
BASICALLY AT THE INSTIGATION OF

01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:07.656
THE GOVERNOR. SENATOR EGGMAN AND

01:22:07.722 --> 01:22:10.025
I CARRIED A BILL THAT

01:22:10.091 --> 01:22:12.594
ESTABLISHED THE CARE PROGRAM AND

01:22:12.661 --> 01:22:15.797
CARE COURT. WHAT CARE COURT DOES

01:22:15.864 --> 01:22:18.300
IS IT FOCUSES ON THOSE WHO ARE

01:22:18.366 --> 01:22:19.401
SCHIZOPHRENIC OR HAVE

01:22:19.467 --> 01:22:22.203
SCHIZOPHRENIA LIKE CONDITIONS.

01:22:22.270 --> 01:22:25.173
WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT CLEANS

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:27.275
UP SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE

01:22:27.342 --> 01:22:29.044
TRYING TO ADDRESS IN TERMS OF

01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:31.279
MAKING CARE COURT MORE EFFICIENT

01:22:31.346 --> 01:22:33.214
AND ADDRESSING THE POPULATION IT

01:22:33.281 --> 01:22:34.816
WAS INTENDED TO ADDRESS. AND

01:22:34.883 --> 01:22:37.385
THOSE ARE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA.

01:22:37.452 --> 01:22:39.688
SCHIZOPHRENIA LIKE CONDITIONS.

01:22:39.754 --> 01:22:40.522
THIS BILL HAS BEEN TRIPLED

01:22:40.588 --> 01:22:41.956
REFERRED. IT'S BEEN THROUGH TWO

01:22:42.023 --> 01:22:43.992
PREVIOUS COMMITTEES FOR THIS

01:22:44.059 --> 01:22:45.460
COMMITTEE. I THINK SOME OF THE

01:22:45.527 --> 01:22:47.162
MOST PERTINENT PARTS ARE THE

01:22:47.228 --> 01:22:49.130
ISSUE SURROUNDING THOSE WHO ARE

01:22:49.197 --> 01:22:50.398
CHARGED WITH MISDEMEANOR BUT ARE

01:22:50.465 --> 01:22:51.800
INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL.

01:22:51.866 --> 01:22:53.535
CURRENT SITUATION IS THOSE WHO

01:22:53.601 --> 01:22:54.836
ARE CHARGED WITH A MISDEMEANOR

01:22:54.903 --> 01:22:56.571
AND INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL

01:22:56.638 --> 01:22:58.673
ARE SIMPLY RELEASED BACK TO LIVE

01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:00.275
UNDER A BRIDGE, IF THAT'S WHERE

01:23:00.342 --> 01:23:03.011
THEY WERE ORIGINALLY FOUND. AND

01:23:03.078 --> 01:23:04.779
SADLY, THAT DOESN'T HELP EITHER

01:23:04.846 --> 01:23:07.282
THEM NOR THE PUBLIC. WHAT THIS

01:23:07.349 --> 01:23:09.417
DOES IS IT ALLOWS THEM TO BE, IN

01:23:09.484 --> 01:23:10.919
ESSENCE, ENROLLED IN CARE COURT

01:23:10.985 --> 01:23:12.687
SO THAT THEY CAN BE TREATED FOR

01:23:12.754 --> 01:23:15.557
THEIR CONDITIONS. IT ALSO

01:23:15.623 --> 01:23:17.792
PROVIDES A BIT OF AN EXPANSION

01:23:17.859 --> 01:23:20.195
OF THE POPULATION FOR WHICH CARE

01:23:20.261 --> 01:23:21.996
COURT CAN BE USED, AND THAT

01:23:22.063 --> 01:23:24.733
WOULD INCLUDE THOSE WITH MOOD

01:23:24.799 --> 01:23:26.768
DISORDERS WITH PSYCHOTIC

01:23:26.835 --> 01:23:29.337
FEATURES. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE

01:23:29.404 --> 01:23:32.006
THAT THIS EXPANSION IS A VERY

01:23:32.073 --> 01:23:33.942
SMALL EXPANSION OF THE

01:23:34.008 --> 01:23:35.643
POPULATION THAT MAY BE TREATED,

01:23:35.710 --> 01:23:38.613
MAY BE BASICALLY ENROLLED IN

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:40.815
CARE COURT. IT ALSO COMBINES

01:23:40.882 --> 01:23:41.916
HEARINGS TO MAKE IT MORE

01:23:41.983 --> 01:23:43.351
EFFICIENT FOR BOTH THE

01:23:43.418 --> 01:23:44.786
PARTICIPANTS AS WELL AS FOR THE

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:46.688
COURTS. WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY

01:23:46.755 --> 01:23:48.289
IN SUPPORT IS DOCTOR AARON

01:23:48.356 --> 01:23:50.892
MEYER, A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

01:23:50.959 --> 01:23:51.693
OFFICER FOR THE CITY OF SAN

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:54.162
DIEGO, AND MARY RUSSELL FROM THE

01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:57.365
JUDICIAL COUNCIL. THANK YOU VERY

01:23:57.432 --> 01:24:00.535
MUCH. MR. OR MISS CHAIR. THANK

01:24:00.602 --> 01:24:03.171
YOU, MR. CHAIR. AND WITH THAT, I.

01:24:03.238 --> 01:24:05.640
I'LL ASK MR. MEYER AND OR DOCTOR

01:24:05.707 --> 01:24:08.843
MEYER, EXCUSE ME AND MR. RUSSELL

01:24:08.910 --> 01:24:10.979
TESTIFY. YOU BOTH HAVE FIVE

01:24:11.045 --> 01:24:12.547
MINUTES. GOOD MORNING. MEMBERS

01:24:13.848 --> 01:24:16.084
AARON MEYER. I'M A PRACTICING

01:24:16.151 --> 01:24:16.718
PSYCHIATRIST AND ASSISTANT

01:24:16.785 --> 01:24:18.186
CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF THE

01:24:18.253 --> 01:24:19.954
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN

01:24:20.021 --> 01:24:21.389
DIEGO. WHILE I'M NOT SPEAKING ON

01:24:21.456 --> 01:24:23.224
BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY OF

01:24:23.291 --> 01:24:24.492
CALIFORNIA, I AM HERE TODAY AS

01:24:24.559 --> 01:24:26.127
THE CONTRACTED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

01:24:26.194 --> 01:24:27.662
OFFICER OF THE CITY OF SAN

01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:29.030
DIEGO, PROUD SUPPORTER OF SENATE

01:24:29.097 --> 01:24:32.567
BILL 27. ACCORDING TO A 2011

01:24:32.634 --> 01:24:34.803
NIMH STUDY, THE 12 MONTH

01:24:34.869 --> 01:24:36.271
PREVALENCE OF BIPOLAR ONE

01:24:36.337 --> 01:24:39.040
DISORDER IN THE UNITED STATES IS

01:24:39.107 --> 01:24:40.775
0.6%, WITH A LIFETIME PREVALENCE

01:24:40.842 --> 01:24:44.112
OF 1.0%. CONSISTENT WITH OTHER

01:24:44.179 --> 01:24:45.814
SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESSES.

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:48.116
HOWEVER, BIPOLAR ONE DISORDER IS

01:24:48.183 --> 01:24:49.484
OVERREPRESENTED IN PRISON

01:24:49.551 --> 01:24:50.919
POPULATIONS, WITH PREVALENCE

01:24:50.985 --> 01:24:54.122
RATES BETWEEN 2% AND 7%. BUT WE

01:24:54.189 --> 01:24:56.424
CAN REVERSE THIS TREND BY

01:24:56.491 --> 01:24:57.759
PRIORITIZING INDIVIDUALS WITH

01:24:57.826 --> 01:24:59.961
SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS IN THE

01:25:00.028 --> 01:25:01.496
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUUM OF

01:25:01.563 --> 01:25:03.598
CARE. BIPOLAR ONE DISORDER WITH

01:25:03.665 --> 01:25:05.300
PSYCHOTIC FEATURES IS A SUBSET

01:25:05.366 --> 01:25:07.168
OF THOSE WITH BIPOLAR ONE

01:25:07.235 --> 01:25:08.536
DISORDER AND DIFFERENT THAN

01:25:08.603 --> 01:25:10.405
BIPOLAR ONE WITHOUT PSYCHOTIC

01:25:10.472 --> 01:25:12.941
FEATURES, THIS SUBSET HAS MORE

01:25:13.007 --> 01:25:14.709
LIFETIME HOSPITALIZATIONS AND

01:25:14.776 --> 01:25:16.644
INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENTS. HIGHER

01:25:16.711 --> 01:25:18.179
RATES OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER,

01:25:18.246 --> 01:25:20.448
AND GREATER UNEMPLOYMENT. THIS

01:25:20.515 --> 01:25:21.850
BILL ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS

01:25:21.916 --> 01:25:24.385
SUBSET REQUIRES PRIORITIZATION.

01:25:24.452 --> 01:25:27.322
IN A STUDY CONDUCTED BY UC DAVIS

01:25:27.388 --> 01:25:29.324
RESEARCHERS, 59% OF PATIENTS

01:25:29.390 --> 01:25:31.259
WITH BIPOLAR ONE DISORDER WERE

01:25:31.326 --> 01:25:32.927
PSYCHOTIC AT THE TIME OF THEIR

01:25:32.994 --> 01:25:35.597
ARREST. SADLY, 62% OF INMATES

01:25:35.663 --> 01:25:37.398
WITH BIPOLAR DISORDER HAD

01:25:37.465 --> 01:25:38.867
RECEIVED INPATIENT TREATMENT IN

01:25:38.933 --> 01:25:40.635
THE THREE MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING

01:25:40.702 --> 01:25:43.838
THEIR ARREST WITH SB 27.

01:25:43.905 --> 01:25:44.973
INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED HELP THE

01:25:45.039 --> 01:25:46.508
MOST HAVE A GREATER CHANCE OF

01:25:46.574 --> 01:25:47.842
LINKAGE TO STABILIZING

01:25:47.909 --> 01:25:50.445
TREATMENT. ACCORDING TO THE

01:25:50.512 --> 01:25:51.746
FEBRUARY 2025 REPORT TO THE LA

01:25:51.813 --> 01:25:54.482
COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS, 59%

01:25:54.549 --> 01:25:55.783
OF CARE COURT REFERRALS CAME

01:25:55.850 --> 01:25:58.019
FROM DIVERSION, BUT IT IS

01:25:58.086 --> 01:25:59.420
UNCLEAR HOW MANY OF THESE

01:25:59.487 --> 01:26:01.489
REFERRALS ACTUALLY RESULTED IN

01:26:01.556 --> 01:26:04.492
PETITIONS. SB 27 CLARIFIES THAT

01:26:04.559 --> 01:26:06.261
REFERRALS CAN BE COUNTED AS

01:26:06.327 --> 01:26:08.730
PETITIONS. THE HOPE OF THE CARE

01:26:08.796 --> 01:26:10.164
ACT PROGRAM WAS TO PREVENT

01:26:10.231 --> 01:26:12.000
AVOIDABLE PSYCHIATRIC

01:26:12.066 --> 01:26:13.601
HOSPITALIZATIONS, INCARCERATION,

01:26:13.668 --> 01:26:15.603
AND CONSERVATORSHIPS BY OFFERING

01:26:15.670 --> 01:26:17.205
A STRUCTURED PATH TO RECOVERY

01:26:17.272 --> 01:26:18.907
AND STABILITY THROUGH A NEW

01:26:18.973 --> 01:26:21.809
CIVIL COURT PROCESS. SB 27 MOVES

01:26:21.876 --> 01:26:24.379
US CLOSER TO THIS VISION, TO

01:26:24.445 --> 01:26:26.681
THIS VISION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

01:26:26.748 --> 01:26:29.651
AND GOOD MORNING, MR. CHAIR, AND

01:26:29.717 --> 01:26:30.718
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MARY

01:26:30.785 --> 01:26:32.153
RUSSELL, ON BEHALF OF THE

01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:33.988
JUDICIAL COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA.

01:26:34.055 --> 01:26:35.356
ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT HAVE AN

01:26:35.423 --> 01:26:36.691
OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE BILL,

01:26:36.758 --> 01:26:38.593
WE WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS OUR

01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:40.962
THANKS TO THE AUTHORS OFFICE FOR

01:26:41.029 --> 01:26:42.597
HIS CONSTANT WILLINGNESS TO

01:26:42.664 --> 01:26:44.332
LISTEN TO TECHNICAL FEEDBACK

01:26:44.399 --> 01:26:46.134
FROM COURTS THAT ARE

01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:47.602
IMPLEMENTING THE CARE PROGRAM ON

01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:50.138
THE GROUND. WE WOULD ALSO LIKE

01:26:50.204 --> 01:26:52.006
TO THANK COMMITTEE STAFF FOR

01:26:52.073 --> 01:26:53.341
CONTINUING AND ENGAGING WITH US

01:26:53.408 --> 01:26:55.143
IN CONVERSATIONS TO REACH THE

01:26:55.209 --> 01:26:56.678
AGREED UPON COMMITTEE

01:26:56.744 --> 01:27:00.982
AMENDMENTS. THE TWO SUGGESTIONS

01:27:01.049 --> 01:27:02.417
FROM THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL THAT

01:27:02.483 --> 01:27:03.952
ARE RELEVANT TO THIS COMMITTEE

01:27:04.018 --> 01:27:05.553
HEAR FIRST WHAT COURTS WERE

01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:07.622
FINDING IN TERMS OF INDIVIDUALS

01:27:07.689 --> 01:27:09.223
WHO WERE INCOMPETENT TO STAND

01:27:09.290 --> 01:27:11.025
TRIAL IN MISDEMEANOR

01:27:11.092 --> 01:27:12.193
PROCEEDINGS. CURRENTLY, PENAL

01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:15.697
CODE 1370 .01 FIRST REQUIRES THE

01:27:15.763 --> 01:27:17.799
COURT TO DO AN EVALUATION TO SEE

01:27:17.865 --> 01:27:19.567
IF THE INDIVIDUAL WOULD ENTER

01:27:19.634 --> 01:27:21.135
INTO MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION

01:27:21.202 --> 01:27:22.870
BEFORE MOVING ON TO OTHER

01:27:22.937 --> 01:27:24.606
OPTIONS, INCLUDING CARE. WHAT

01:27:24.672 --> 01:27:26.274
COURTS WERE FINDING WERE THAT

01:27:26.341 --> 01:27:28.242
THERE WOULD BE SOME INDIVIDUALS

01:27:28.309 --> 01:27:30.411
FOR WHICH, YOU KNOW, IT MAY BE

01:27:30.478 --> 01:27:31.879
MORE OR LESS CLEAR THAT PERHAPS

01:27:31.946 --> 01:27:33.681
THEY WEREN'T SUITABLE CANDIDATES

01:27:33.748 --> 01:27:35.483
FOR DIVERSION, HOWEVER THEY

01:27:35.550 --> 01:27:37.251
WOULD. THERE WOULD BE TIME THAT

01:27:37.318 --> 01:27:39.153
THEY WOULD HAVE TO SPEND

01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:40.154
LANGUISHING WHILE THE COURTS

01:27:40.221 --> 01:27:42.256
UNDERGO THAT DIVERSION

01:27:42.323 --> 01:27:44.058
ASSESSMENT. AND SO PART OF OUR

01:27:44.125 --> 01:27:45.927
SUGGESTIONS WERE TO MOVE THE

01:27:45.994 --> 01:27:49.163
CARE ELIGIBILITY PORTION UP SO

01:27:49.230 --> 01:27:52.100
THAT A PERSON CAN BE EVALUATED

01:27:52.166 --> 01:27:53.901
FOR MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION AND

01:27:53.968 --> 01:27:55.570
CARE PROCEEDINGS AT THE SAME

01:27:55.637 --> 01:27:57.438
TIME. AND TO THAT END, IN TERMS

01:27:57.505 --> 01:28:00.308
OF OUR SECOND SUGGESTION

01:28:00.375 --> 01:28:03.578
RELEVANT TO THIS COMMITTEE WAS

01:28:03.645 --> 01:28:05.446
WE BELIEVE THAT WHEN IT COMES TO

01:28:05.513 --> 01:28:06.648
THE REFERRAL AND PETITION

01:28:06.714 --> 01:28:08.149
PROCESS, WE SAW THAT THERE WAS A

01:28:08.216 --> 01:28:09.784
LITTLE BIT OF LAG TIME IN TERMS

01:28:09.851 --> 01:28:12.353
OF THE TIME FROM WHEN THE

01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:12.920
CRIMINAL COURT WOULD REFER A

01:28:12.987 --> 01:28:15.757
CASE TO THE CARE COURT, AND SO

01:28:15.823 --> 01:28:17.492
WHAT OUR AMENDMENTS DO IS

01:28:17.558 --> 01:28:19.627
CLARIFY THAT IF A COURT IS

01:28:19.694 --> 01:28:21.796
REFERRING AN INDIVIDUAL OVER TO

01:28:21.863 --> 01:28:24.165
CARE, THAT IF THE REFERRAL MEETS

01:28:24.232 --> 01:28:26.167
THE REQUIREMENTS OF A PETITION,

01:28:26.234 --> 01:28:27.468
THAT IT COULD BE TREATED AS A

01:28:27.535 --> 01:28:29.737
PETITION FOR CARE PURPOSES IN

01:28:29.804 --> 01:28:31.606
ORDER TO HELP EXPEDITE THE

01:28:31.673 --> 01:28:34.075
PROCESS AND GET THE INDIVIDUAL

01:28:34.142 --> 01:28:36.911
THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED.

01:28:36.978 --> 01:28:38.713
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:39.747

01:29:39.974 --> 01:29:41.442
MORNING. VICE CHAIR MEMBERS

MICHELLE CABRERA WITH THE COUNTY

01:29:42.810 --> 01:29:44.178
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS

01:29:44.245 --> 01:29:46.547
ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. AND

01:29:46.614 --> 01:29:48.983
WE ARE IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION

01:29:49.050 --> 01:29:52.887
OF SB 27 FROM THE VANTAGE POINT

01:29:52.954 --> 01:29:54.655
OF COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

01:29:54.722 --> 01:29:56.557
DIRECTORS WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED

01:29:56.624 --> 01:29:58.392
IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CARE

01:29:58.459 --> 01:30:02.530
COURT SINCE OCTOBER 2023, THIS

01:30:02.597 --> 01:30:04.699
BILL IS MUCH MORE THAN A MERE

01:30:04.766 --> 01:30:06.667
CLEANUP OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE

01:30:06.734 --> 01:30:09.470
CARE ACT, AND IN FACT, BY

01:30:09.537 --> 01:30:12.340
BLURRING THE LINES BETWEEN CARE

01:30:12.406 --> 01:30:15.109
COURT, WHICH IS INTENDED AS A

01:30:15.176 --> 01:30:17.645
VOLUNTARY CIVIL COURT PROCESS,

01:30:17.712 --> 01:30:20.148
ALONG WITH THE CRIMINAL

01:30:20.214 --> 01:30:23.417
PROCEEDINGS THAT TAKE PLACE

01:30:23.484 --> 01:30:26.420
UNDER AN INCOMPETENT TO STAND

01:30:26.487 --> 01:30:29.090
TRIAL REFERRAL. WE ARE CONCERNED

01:30:29.157 --> 01:30:31.025
THAT THIS WILL LEAD TO ALTERING

01:30:31.092 --> 01:30:33.161
THE VERY NATURE OF CARE COURT

01:30:33.227 --> 01:30:37.532
FROM A VOLUNTARY TO A COERCIVE

01:30:37.598 --> 01:30:39.433
MEASURE, BY PROVIDING BOTH

01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:40.701
CARROTS AND STICKS. AND I'LL

01:30:40.768 --> 01:30:42.937
EXPLAIN THIS. WHAT THIS BILL

01:30:43.004 --> 01:30:45.206
DOES IS IT SAYS THAT IF A PERSON

01:30:45.273 --> 01:30:46.974
IS ESTE AND THEY'RE REFERRED

01:30:47.041 --> 01:30:50.311
INTO CARE COURT WITHIN SIX

01:30:50.378 --> 01:30:52.713
MONTHS, CARE CAN REFER THAT

01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:54.081
INDIVIDUAL BACK TO CRIMINAL

01:30:54.148 --> 01:30:55.883
PROCEEDINGS. IT DOESN'T PROVIDE

01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:59.253
GUIDANCE ON WHEN, WHY OR HOW WE

01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:01.556
WOULD ESTABLISH THIS REFERRAL

01:31:01.622 --> 01:31:05.993
BACK TO THE COURT. AND TO BE

01:31:06.060 --> 01:31:08.529
CLEAR, IN ADDITION, WE ALSO

01:31:08.596 --> 01:31:10.631
APPRECIATE THAT THE GOAL OF

01:31:10.698 --> 01:31:12.266
CLOSING THESE LOOPHOLES AND

01:31:12.333 --> 01:31:14.268
ALLOWING PEOPLE TO COME DIRECTLY

01:31:14.335 --> 01:31:16.337
INTO CARE COURT IS THE

01:31:16.404 --> 01:31:17.905
INTENTION. WE THINK THAT THE WAY

01:31:17.972 --> 01:31:19.707
THAT THIS LANGUAGE IS

01:31:19.774 --> 01:31:21.776
STRUCTURED, IT ACTUALLY LEAVES

01:31:21.843 --> 01:31:23.578
US AND THE CLIENTS THAT WE'RE

01:31:23.644 --> 01:31:24.779
SEEKING TO SERVE, MORE

01:31:24.846 --> 01:31:27.348
VULNERABLE TO THEM FACING

01:31:27.415 --> 01:31:28.683
EXACTLY THE FATE THAT THE

01:31:28.749 --> 01:31:30.718
SENATOR IS TRYING TO AVOID.

01:31:30.785 --> 01:31:32.119
CURRENTLY, IN OUR EXPERIENCE,

01:31:32.186 --> 01:31:34.388
WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE

01:31:34.455 --> 01:31:37.024
COURTS TO DEVELOP SORT OF A PRE

01:31:37.091 --> 01:31:39.393
PETITION PROCESS AND TO GET THAT

01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:40.862
IN PLACE PRIOR TO THE

01:31:40.928 --> 01:31:42.330
INDIVIDUAL'S RELEASE UNDER THE

01:31:42.396 --> 01:31:43.831
LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL, IT WOULD

01:31:43.898 --> 01:31:46.000
SPEED UP CERTAIN ELEMENTS AND,

01:31:46.067 --> 01:31:48.102
AND STILL LEAVE THOSE PEOPLE

01:31:48.169 --> 01:31:49.537
VULNERABLE TO BEING RELEASED

01:31:49.604 --> 01:31:50.905
WITHOUT OUR KNOWLEDGE AND

01:31:50.972 --> 01:31:52.173
FRANKLY, WITHOUT THE INFORMATION

01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:55.142
WE NEED. CURRENTLY, WHEN WE GET

01:31:55.209 --> 01:31:56.444
A REFERRAL FROM A CRIMINAL

01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:57.845
COURT, IT IS A MINUTE ORDER. IT

01:31:57.912 --> 01:31:59.280
INCLUDES THE DEFENDANT'S NAME

01:31:59.347 --> 01:32:00.548
AND THE FACILITY THAT THEY'RE

01:32:00.615 --> 01:32:02.516
BEING DISCHARGED FROM LITTLE

01:32:02.583 --> 01:32:05.419
ELSE. SO WE ARE VERY CONCERNED

01:32:05.486 --> 01:32:06.721
WITH THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL.

01:32:06.787 --> 01:32:08.689
I WILL NOTE THAT COUNTY

01:32:08.756 --> 01:32:10.458
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS AND

01:32:10.524 --> 01:32:11.759
THE PRACTITIONERS WHO HAVE BEEN

01:32:11.826 --> 01:32:13.861
IMPLEMENTING CARE COURT HAVE NOT

01:32:13.928 --> 01:32:15.096
BEEN CONSULTED, AND WE REALLY

01:32:15.162 --> 01:32:17.665
WOULD APPRECIATE AN OPPORTUNITY

01:32:17.732 --> 01:32:19.066
TO INFORM THE LANGUAGE BASED ON

01:32:19.133 --> 01:32:21.168
OUR DIRECT EXPERIENCE. I THINK

01:32:21.235 --> 01:32:22.970
THAT WE SHARE, AGAIN, THE GOAL

01:32:23.037 --> 01:32:24.639
OF MAKING SURE THAT INDIVIDUALS

01:32:24.705 --> 01:32:26.274
WITH SIGNIFICANT MENTAL HEALTH

01:32:26.340 --> 01:32:27.508
CONDITIONS ARE NOT CRIMINALIZED

01:32:27.575 --> 01:32:29.210
AND THAT, WHEN POSSIBLE, THEY

01:32:29.277 --> 01:32:33.748
ARE SENT TO TREATMENT INSTEAD OF

01:32:33.814 --> 01:32:36.851
INCARCERATION. THANK YOU. THANK

01:32:36.918 --> 01:32:39.553
YOU, HONORABLE CHAIR AND PUBLIC

01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:42.089
SAFETY COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY

01:32:42.156 --> 01:32:43.824
NAME IS LESLIE NAPPER. I'M A

01:32:43.891 --> 01:32:45.660
MOTHER, GRANDMOTHER, AUNT. I'M

01:32:45.726 --> 01:32:47.061
AN ACTIVE COMMUNITY MEMBER AND

01:32:47.128 --> 01:32:49.597
PROUD SACRAMENTO. AND I ALSO

01:32:49.664 --> 01:32:51.899
LIVE WITH BIPOLAR ONE DISORDER

01:32:51.966 --> 01:32:54.402
WITH PSYCHOTIC FEATURES. I AM A

01:32:54.468 --> 01:32:56.070
I WORK WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS

01:32:56.137 --> 01:32:58.239
CALIFORNIA AS A SENIOR ADVOCATE,

01:32:58.306 --> 01:33:02.243
AND I URGE YOU TO OPPOSE SB 27.

01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:04.412
SB 27 WOULD MASSIVELY EXPAND

01:33:04.478 --> 01:33:06.280
CARE COURT ELIGIBILITY, PUTTING

01:33:06.347 --> 01:33:08.082
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

01:33:08.149 --> 01:33:09.784
CALIFORNIANS LIKE ME AT RISK OF

01:33:09.850 --> 01:33:11.953
BEING PULLED INTO THE SYSTEM.

01:33:12.019 --> 01:33:13.821
COUNTIES ESTIMATE THAT SB 27

01:33:13.888 --> 01:33:15.823
WOULD INCREASE THE NUMBERS OF

01:33:15.890 --> 01:33:17.725
PEOPLE SWEPT INTO AN INEFFECTIVE

01:33:17.792 --> 01:33:21.429
CARE COURT PROGRAM BY EIGHT

01:33:21.495 --> 01:33:23.297
TIMES. CARE COURT IS NOT

01:33:23.364 --> 01:33:25.299
EVIDENCE BASED. THERE'S NO DATA

01:33:25.366 --> 01:33:26.667
THAT IT PROVES THAT IT HELPS

01:33:26.734 --> 01:33:29.236
PEOPLE RECOVER. HOWEVER, IT CAN

01:33:29.303 --> 01:33:32.206
HAVE DIRE CONSEQUENCES FOR

01:33:32.273 --> 01:33:36.544
PEOPLE LIKE ME IF WE DON'T

01:33:36.610 --> 01:33:38.212
COMPLY WITH THE CARE. WITH CARE

01:33:38.279 --> 01:33:42.550
COURT, WE RISK BEING PLACED IN

01:33:42.616 --> 01:33:44.685
CONSERVATORSHIP AND LOSING OUR

01:33:44.752 --> 01:33:47.488
RIGHTS TO CHOOSE WHERE WE LIVE

01:33:47.555 --> 01:33:49.724
OR HAVE INFORMED MEDICAL

01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:52.460
DECISION MAKING, HOW WE SPEND

01:33:52.526 --> 01:33:54.495
OUR MONEY, OR EVEN OUR WHETHER

01:33:54.562 --> 01:33:57.765
OR NOT WE CAN VOTE AS A PERSON

01:33:57.832 --> 01:33:59.567
OF COLOR. I AM DEEPLY ALARMED.

01:33:59.633 --> 01:34:01.802
IN SOME COUNTIES, BLACK AND

01:34:01.869 --> 01:34:03.604
INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES ARE OVER

01:34:03.671 --> 01:34:04.839
TWICE AS LIKELY TO BE

01:34:04.905 --> 01:34:06.941
PETITIONED. THE DATA SHOWS THE

01:34:07.008 --> 01:34:07.775
SIGNIFICANT THERE ARE

01:34:07.842 --> 01:34:09.443
SIGNIFICANT RACIAL DISPARITIES

01:34:09.510 --> 01:34:11.312
IN WHO IT IMPACTS AND THAT

01:34:11.379 --> 01:34:13.147
PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING THE

01:34:13.214 --> 01:34:14.949
SERVICES THEY NEED THROUGH IT.

01:34:15.016 --> 01:34:16.884
THROUGH IT CARE COURT DOES NOT

01:34:16.951 --> 01:34:19.620
PAY FOR CARE LIKE TREATMENT OR

01:34:19.687 --> 01:34:21.422
HOUSING. INSTEAD, IT FUNNELS

01:34:21.489 --> 01:34:22.757
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS

01:34:22.823 --> 01:34:25.092
INTO THE LEGAL PROCESS. CARE

01:34:25.159 --> 01:34:27.528
COURT COSTS OVER $700,000 PER

01:34:27.595 --> 01:34:29.730
PERSON. THAT COULD BE BETTER

01:34:29.797 --> 01:34:31.966
SPENT ON COMMUNITY RESPONSIVE

01:34:32.033 --> 01:34:34.035
SERVICES, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

01:34:34.101 --> 01:34:35.836
SERVICES, PEER SUPPORT AND

01:34:35.903 --> 01:34:37.405
PROVEN COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES

01:34:37.471 --> 01:34:39.373
LIKE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS

01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:42.676
WITH FIDELITY TO ACT THAT ALSO

01:34:42.743 --> 01:34:45.012
PROVIDE WRAPAROUND SERVICES FOR

01:34:45.079 --> 01:34:47.481
THOSE OF US THAT BENEFIT. THANK

01:34:47.548 --> 01:34:50.985
YOU SIR, AM I OVER? MAY I CLOSE?

01:34:51.052 --> 01:34:51.519
YES. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I

01:34:51.585 --> 01:34:54.021
APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND GRACE.

01:34:54.088 --> 01:34:55.222
I AM ONE OF THOUSANDS OF

01:34:55.289 --> 01:34:56.757
CALIFORNIANS LIVING WITH BIPOLAR

01:34:56.824 --> 01:34:58.159
DISORDER WITH PSYCHOTIC

01:34:58.225 --> 01:34:59.860
FEATURES. WE ARE YOUR NEIGHBORS,

01:34:59.927 --> 01:35:02.229
YOUR COWORKERS, AND YOUR LOVED

01:35:02.296 --> 01:35:04.832
ONES. WHAT WE NEED IS REAL CARE

01:35:04.899 --> 01:35:06.500
AND IT'S NOT FOUND IN A

01:35:06.567 --> 01:35:08.335
COURTROOM. PLEASE PROTECT US AND

ANY QUESTIONS? COMMENTS? MR.

01:40:22.316 --> 01:40:28.188
LACKEY? ONCE AGAIN, WE HAVE AN

01:40:28.255 --> 01:40:29.089
AWKWARD REALITY THAT WE'RE

01:40:29.156 --> 01:40:31.959
TRYING TO MANAGE. WHAT WE HAVE

01:40:32.025 --> 01:40:34.495
IS WE HAVE PEOPLE WITH EXTREME

01:40:34.561 --> 01:40:38.632
DISABILITY, AND I, I ADMIRE THE

01:40:38.699 --> 01:40:40.601
OPPOSITION FOR FIGHTING FOR

01:40:40.667 --> 01:40:43.370
LIBERTY. I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S

01:40:43.437 --> 01:40:45.239
VERY NATURAL TO UNDERSTAND THAT

01:40:45.305 --> 01:40:47.608
PIECE. BUT THERE'S ANOTHER PART

01:40:47.674 --> 01:40:49.610
OF THIS THAT NEEDS TO REALLY BE

01:40:49.676 --> 01:40:52.713
ADMITTED TO. AND THE SYSTEM WE

01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:55.015
HAVE NOW IS WHAT CRIMINALIZES

01:40:55.082 --> 01:40:56.817
PEOPLE HAVING WORE A BADGE, I

01:40:56.884 --> 01:40:59.353
KNOW WHEN WE TAKE PEOPLE FOR

01:40:59.420 --> 01:41:02.489
5150, IT'S A FORM OF CUSTODY.

01:41:02.556 --> 01:41:05.692
AND NO MATTER WHAT WE DO, WE

01:41:05.759 --> 01:41:08.362
HAVE TO HELP THESE PEOPLE

01:41:08.429 --> 01:41:09.696
SOMETIMES PROTECT THEM AGAINST

01:41:09.763 --> 01:41:12.566
THEMSELVES. AND AS DIFFICULT AS

01:41:12.633 --> 01:41:14.935
THAT SOUNDS, THAT REALLY IS THE

01:41:15.002 --> 01:41:18.539
TRUTH WE ALL HAVE SEEN THE

01:41:18.605 --> 01:41:20.107
DISHEARTENING CIRCUMSTANCES AND

01:41:20.174 --> 01:41:22.242
REALITY OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE,

01:41:22.309 --> 01:41:25.446
QUOTE UNQUOTE, CHOSEN TO LIVE

01:41:25.512 --> 01:41:28.449
THE WAY THEY ARE LIVING. I DON'T

01:41:28.515 --> 01:41:31.652
THINK PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE

01:41:31.718 --> 01:41:34.688
GRAVITY OF HOW BAD IT IS. MAYBE

01:41:34.755 --> 01:41:37.324
YOU DO, BUT IF YOU UNDERSTAND

01:41:37.391 --> 01:41:41.061
THE GRAVITY OF HOW SEVERE THESE

01:41:41.128 --> 01:41:43.797
CONDITIONS ARE, YOU WOULD WANT

01:41:43.864 --> 01:41:45.999
TO SHOW CARE. AND THAT'S WHY

01:41:46.066 --> 01:41:48.669
THIS HAS BEEN LABELED AS SUCH. A

01:41:48.735 --> 01:41:51.738
LOT OF PEOPLE MISINTERPRET

01:41:51.805 --> 01:41:54.374
TAKING CONTROL OF SOMEBODY WHO

01:41:54.441 --> 01:41:58.011
IS OUT OF CONTROL, AS UNCARING

01:41:58.078 --> 01:42:01.281
AS CRIMINALIZATION. AND I FIND

01:42:01.348 --> 01:42:05.018
THAT TO BE MISGUIDED BECAUSE I'M

01:42:05.085 --> 01:42:07.888
TELLING YOU, MY LIFE EXPERIENCE

01:42:07.955 --> 01:42:10.557
IS ONE THAT HAS OPENED MY EYES

01:42:10.624 --> 01:42:13.327
TO THIS PROBLEM VERY, VERY

01:42:13.393 --> 01:42:15.629
LOUDLY. AND IT CONTINUES TO BE A

01:42:15.696 --> 01:42:18.098
DEEP CONCERN OF MINE. AND WHAT

01:42:18.165 --> 01:42:19.900
WE GOT TO REMEMBER IS THE

01:42:19.967 --> 01:42:23.871
DIAGNOSIS HAS TO BE SEVERE. AND

01:42:23.937 --> 01:42:27.074
BECAUSE OF THAT, WE HAVE TO TRY

01:42:27.140 --> 01:42:29.109
TO IMPROVE THE CIRCUMSTANCES

01:42:29.176 --> 01:42:31.778
THAT PEOPLE HAVE, QUOTE UNQUOTE,

01:42:31.845 --> 01:42:34.681
CHOSEN. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY

01:42:34.748 --> 01:42:38.352
CHOOSES TO LIVE ON THE STREETS

01:42:38.418 --> 01:42:41.154
SCAVENGING THROUGH ANY PATHWAY

01:42:41.221 --> 01:42:43.557
AT ALL JUST TO GET FOOD. I'VE

01:42:43.624 --> 01:42:46.593
SEEN IT. PEOPLE RIFLING THROUGH

01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:48.395
DUMPSTERS, RIFLING THROUGH

01:42:48.462 --> 01:42:51.098
TRASH. THAT'S NOT HUMANE, THAT'S

01:42:51.164 --> 01:42:54.134
NOT CARING. WHAT'S CARING IS

01:42:54.201 --> 01:42:57.304
TRYING TO TAKE CONTROL AND OFFER

01:42:57.371 --> 01:43:00.307
ASSISTANCE. AND I, I UNDERSTAND

01:43:00.374 --> 01:43:01.909
THAT THE VOLUNTARY ADMISSION,

01:43:01.975 --> 01:43:03.443
IT'S WORTHY OF DEBATE. WE NEED

01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:04.978
TO DEBATE THIS. WE NEED TO

01:43:05.045 --> 01:43:06.413
DISCUSS IT AND MAKE SURE THAT

01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:09.449
THIS IS A LAST RESORT OF TAKING

01:43:09.516 --> 01:43:11.051
CONTROL AND ROBBING PEOPLE OF

01:43:11.118 --> 01:43:13.587
THEIR LIBERTY. BUT I TELL YOU,

01:43:13.654 --> 01:43:15.622
THERE ARE MANY, MANY, MANY

01:43:15.689 --> 01:43:17.858
CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THIS IS IN

01:43:17.925 --> 01:43:20.694
DEMAND. WE'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND

01:43:20.761 --> 01:43:23.697
THAT ALTHOUGH IT FEELS LOUSY, WE

01:43:23.764 --> 01:43:25.766
HAVE TO HELP THEM. WE HAVE TO

01:43:25.832 --> 01:43:27.601
HELP THEM, MAN. AND WE'RE NOT

01:43:27.668 --> 01:43:28.735
HELPING THEM BY LETTING THEM

01:43:28.802 --> 01:43:30.103
JUST STAY IN THAT CONDITION.

01:43:30.170 --> 01:43:33.173
THAT'S NOT HELP. IT'S SOMETHING

01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:35.175
MUCH DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT'S

01:43:35.242 --> 01:43:38.111
OUTCOME BASED. SO THERE'S

01:43:38.178 --> 01:43:39.513
STUDIES, THERE'S DATA AND

01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:41.815
THERE'S REALITY. WE ALL KNOW THE

01:43:41.882 --> 01:43:44.818
REALITY, FOLKS. IT IS BROKEN AND

01:43:44.885 --> 01:43:47.287
WE NEED TO DO BETTER. AND I

01:43:47.354 --> 01:43:49.556
THINK THAT THIS IS A STEP TO TRY

01:43:49.623 --> 01:43:51.992
TO DO BETTER. IT'S NOT WITHOUT

01:43:52.059 --> 01:43:55.596
DEBATE. IT'S NOT NOT WITHOUT

01:43:55.662 --> 01:43:56.663
ENGAGEMENT. BUT LET'S BE HONEST.

01:43:56.730 --> 01:43:58.031
LET'S BE HONEST WITH EACH OTHER

01:43:58.098 --> 01:44:00.267
AND LET'S SHOW WHAT REAL CARE

01:44:00.334 --> 01:44:03.236
IS. AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A

01:44:03.303 --> 01:44:04.638
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, SO

01:44:04.705 --> 01:44:07.874
THAT'S WHY I'LL SUPPORT IT.

01:44:07.941 --> 01:44:08.942
THANK YOU, MR. LACKEY. ANYONE

01:44:09.009 --> 01:44:12.479

OPPOSITION. UNLESS IT IS AMENDED

01:46:19.473 --> 01:46:21.041
TO DELETE THE PORTION OF THE

01:46:21.108 --> 01:46:23.310
BILL THAT EXPANDS THE ABILITY TO

OBTAIN A SEARCH WARRANT FOR YET

01:46:25.112 --> 01:46:27.380

01:46:27.447 --> 01:46:30.083
OF THE BILL THAT WE OBJECT TO IS

01:46:30.150 --> 01:46:32.152

CODE, SECTION 1524, WHICH COVERS

01:46:37.290 --> 01:46:39.826
THE ISSUANCE OF SEARCH WARRANTS.

01:46:39.893 --> 01:46:42.095
SUBDIVISION 23 WOULD EXPAND THE

EXPANSION IS UNNECESSARY. PRICE

01:46:57.878 --> 01:46:59.246

DISPLACED BY THE EVACUATION

01:51:52.138 --> 01:51:54.307

FIREFIGHTERS, FEMA WORKERS AND

01:52:07.053 --> 01:52:09.022
EVEN LAW ENFORCEMENT TO GAIN

THEIR HOMES AND LOST THEIR

01:52:18.898 --> 01:52:22.335
POSSESSIONS? THESE THESE ABUSERS

01:52:22.402 --> 01:52:24.737
ENGAGE IN LOOTING AND PROPERTY

01:52:24.804 --> 01:52:27.340

THE FAMILIES TO FIND OUT THAT

AND TO THEIR PERSONAL

01:52:38.685 --> 01:52:41.054

COMMUNITIES AND VICTIMS OF

01:52:47.293 --> 01:52:49.996
PERSONAL PROPERTY. COMMUNITIES

01:52:50.063 --> 01:52:51.564
CAN'T TRUST THE DIRECTIONS OF

01:52:51.631 --> 01:52:53.867
PUBLIC SAFETY AND THE OFFICIALS

01:52:53.933 --> 01:52:56.669
IF THEY ARE UNSURE WHO TO TRUST,

01:52:56.736 --> 01:52:58.705
WHO'S WEARING THE UNIFORM, WHO

CHERISHED BELONGINGS ARE SAFELY

01:53:05.812 --> 01:53:08.815
LEFT BEHIND AND PROTECTED BY

01:53:08.882 --> 01:53:11.818
LAWFULLY AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS.

01:53:11.885 --> 01:53:14.287
THESE ABUSERS AND THEIR ACTIONS

01:53:14.354 --> 01:53:16.789
UNDERMINE EVACUATION ORDERS.

01:53:16.856 --> 01:53:18.992
OFFICIALS WITH AUTHORITY TO MOVE

01:53:19.058 --> 01:53:22.061
THE VICTIMS AND TO MOVE THE

01:53:22.128 --> 01:53:24.731
INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE VICTIMIZED

01:53:24.797 --> 01:53:26.533
BY SOME OF THESE INDIVIDUALS

01:53:26.599 --> 01:53:29.702
BECAUSE OF THE FIRES. WE'VE GOT

01:53:29.769 --> 01:53:31.437
TO GIVE THESE VICTIMS PEACE OF

01:53:31.504 --> 01:53:33.973
MIND. TRAGEDIES WILL HAPPEN

01:53:34.040 --> 01:53:37.710
AGAIN. LET'S MAKE SURE THAT

01:53:37.777 --> 01:53:40.146
IMPERSONATORS AREN'T INVOLVED AT

01:53:40.213 --> 01:53:42.448
ALL, ENSURING THAT THE PUBLIC

01:53:42.515 --> 01:53:44.617
CAN TRUST FIRST RESPONDERS AND

01:53:44.684 --> 01:53:47.053
LOCAL PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICIALS IS

01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:48.755
CRUCIAL IN KEEPING COMMUNITIES

01:53:48.821 --> 01:53:50.623
SAFE, ESPECIALLY DURING THE

01:53:50.690 --> 01:53:52.325
STATE OF EMERGENCIES WHEN

01:53:52.392 --> 01:53:56.296
VICTIMS ARE IN THEIR DISARRAY.

01:53:56.362 --> 01:53:59.232

01:53:59.299 --> 01:54:02.869
SENATE BILL 571 IS A CLEAR SIGN.

01:54:02.936 --> 01:54:05.705

OF THE BILL. I JUST WANT TO SAY

01:55:45.772 --> 01:55:47.507
THAT OUR PENAL CODE IS SUPPOSED

01:55:47.573 --> 01:55:48.174
TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE

01:55:48.241 --> 01:55:50.543
SEVERITY OF CRIMES AND THE

PUNISHMENT CREATED THEREIN. AND

01:55:53.413 --> 01:55:54.847
OBVIOUSLY, AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM

01:55:54.914 --> 01:55:56.382
THE AUTHOR AND WITNESSES AND AS

01:55:56.449 --> 01:55:58.318
I'VE TALKED TO THE CHIEFS, THE

01:55:58.384 --> 01:55:59.585
SEVERITY OF THESE CRIMES

01:55:59.652 --> 01:56:00.687
COMMITTED IN THE AFTERMATH OF

01:56:00.753 --> 01:56:02.689
THE FIRE, THE LOOTING, THE

01:56:02.755 --> 01:56:03.856
IMPERSONATING THE OFFICER, THE

01:56:03.923 --> 01:56:05.892
DAMAGE IT CAUSES NOT JUST TO THE

01:56:05.958 --> 01:56:07.226
AGENCIES BUT TO THE INDIVIDUALS

01:56:07.293 --> 01:56:09.562
WHOSE PROPERTY IS, IS STOLEN AND

01:56:09.629 --> 01:56:10.963
THE TRUST THAT IS LOST TO THE

01:56:13.966 --> 01:56:15.435
EMERGENCY LIKE THIS IS MUCH,

01:56:15.501 --> 01:56:17.170
MUCH MORE SEVERE THAN THE

01:56:17.236 --> 01:56:18.371
CURRENT PENALTY SYSTEM THAT WE

01:56:18.438 --> 01:56:20.606
HAD IN PLACE WHEN WE REVIEWED

01:56:20.673 --> 01:56:21.641
THIS AFTER THE FACT. AND SO WE

01:56:21.708 --> 01:56:22.542
THINK THAT INCREASING THE

01:56:22.608 --> 01:56:24.911
PENALTIES IN THE WAYS THAT THESE

01:56:24.977 --> 01:56:25.845
TWO BILLS ARE DOING THIS YEAR

01:56:25.912 --> 01:56:27.480
ARE IMPORTANT, MEANINGFUL AND

01:56:27.547 --> 01:56:29.048
APPROPRIATE. AGAIN, GIVEN THE

01:56:29.115 --> 01:56:31.884
SEVERITY OF THE CRIMES THAT WE

01:56:31.951 --> 01:56:32.518

01:56:32.585 --> 01:56:35.054

A JUDGE ADVOCATE WITH ACLU

01:57:59.572 --> 01:58:00.840
CALIFORNIA ACTION. I WANT TO

01:58:00.907 --> 01:58:02.975
START BY THANKING THE AUTHOR FOR

01:58:03.042 --> 01:58:03.709
TAKING AMENDMENTS THAT DID

01:58:03.776 --> 01:58:05.178
ADDRESS MANY OF OUR CONCERNS.

01:58:05.244 --> 01:58:06.679
HOWEVER, WE STILL CONTINUE TO

01:58:06.746 --> 01:58:08.114
HAVE VERY SERIOUS CONCERNS WITH

01:58:08.181 --> 01:58:09.449
THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'RE

01:58:09.515 --> 01:58:11.250
ACCEPTING, AND WHAT'S IN PRINT

01:58:11.317 --> 01:58:13.085
IS IMPORTANT TO REMIND EVERYONE

01:58:13.152 --> 01:58:14.921
THAT EXISTING LAW ALREADY

01:58:14.987 --> 01:58:16.155
IMPOSES SEVERE PENALTIES FOR THE

01:58:16.222 --> 01:58:18.057
FALSE IMPERSONATION OF EMERGENCY

01:58:18.124 --> 01:58:20.259
PERSONNEL AS A MISDEMEANOR, AND

01:58:20.326 --> 01:58:21.727
STRONG EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT

01:58:21.794 --> 01:58:23.196
LONGER CRIMINAL SENTENCES HAS

01:58:23.262 --> 01:58:25.298
FAILED TO PROMOTE DETERRENCE.

01:58:25.364 --> 01:58:26.799
THIS NOTION IS SUPPORTED BY THE

01:58:26.866 --> 01:58:28.034
FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE,

01:58:28.100 --> 01:58:29.702
WHICH DISCOURAGES INCREASING

01:58:29.769 --> 01:58:31.037
EXISTING PUNISHMENTS, NOTING

01:58:31.103 --> 01:58:32.572
THAT LONGER SENTENCING DOES

01:58:32.638 --> 01:58:35.041
LITTLE TO DETER CRIME. OTHER

01:58:35.107 --> 01:58:36.442
FINDINGS HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE

01:58:36.509 --> 01:58:38.277
CERTAINTY OF PUNISHMENT THAT

01:58:38.344 --> 01:58:39.378
SOMEONE WILL BE PUNISHED FOR

01:58:39.445 --> 01:58:40.913
PARTICULAR CRIME HAS A GREATER

01:58:40.980 --> 01:58:41.848
DETERRENCE EFFECT THAN THE

01:58:41.914 --> 01:58:43.049
SEVERITY OF THE PUNISHMENT

01:58:43.115 --> 01:58:45.585
ITSELF. I IMPLORE EVERY MEMBER

01:58:45.651 --> 01:58:47.353
IN THIS COMMITTEE TO FOLLOW THE

01:58:47.420 --> 01:58:48.654
EVIDENCE AND TO NOT MOVE FORWARD

01:58:48.721 --> 01:58:50.089
WITH THE TIRED AND FAILED

01:58:50.156 --> 01:58:51.524
CARCERAL SOLUTIONS OF TOUGH ON

01:58:51.591 --> 01:58:53.926
CRIME POLICIES THAT HAVE RAVAGED

01:58:53.993 --> 01:58:56.229
OUR COMMUNITIES. IT IS NO

01:58:56.295 --> 01:58:57.330
COINCIDENCE WHY THIS NATION HAS

01:58:57.396 --> 01:58:58.498
THE HIGHEST INCARCERATION RATE

01:58:58.564 --> 01:58:59.899
IN THE WORLD, MAKING UP LESS

01:58:59.966 --> 01:59:01.634
THAN 5% OF THE WORLD'S

01:59:01.701 --> 01:59:03.069
POPULATION, BUT NEARLY A QUARTER

01:59:03.135 --> 01:59:05.204
OF ITS PRISON POPULATION. AND

01:59:05.271 --> 01:59:06.672
IT'S BECAUSE WE CONTINUE TO PASS

01:59:06.739 --> 01:59:08.407
POLICIES THAT CONTRADICT

01:59:08.474 --> 01:59:09.442
EVIDENCE AND LOCK PEOPLE UP FOR

01:59:09.509 --> 01:59:11.277
AN EGREGIOUS AMOUNT OF TIME,

01:59:11.344 --> 01:59:12.478
RATHER THAN FOCUSING OUR ENERGY

01:59:12.545 --> 01:59:14.981
ON THE ROOT CAUSES OF CRIME, WE

01:59:15.047 --> 01:59:16.048
HAVE TO HONESTLY ASK OURSELVES

01:59:16.115 --> 01:59:17.450
WHAT THE PURPOSE IS AND

01:59:17.517 --> 01:59:18.784
INCREASING CRIMINAL SENTENCES

01:59:18.851 --> 01:59:19.986
WHEN THERE'S SO MUCH EVIDENCE

01:59:20.052 --> 01:59:21.854
THAT IT DOES NOTHING TO DETER

01:59:21.921 --> 01:59:25.491
CRIME AND COST TAXPAYERS ROUGHLY

01:59:25.558 --> 01:59:26.526
$130,000 TO INCARCERATE EACH

01:59:26.592 --> 01:59:28.728
INDIVIDUAL A YEAR, CAN THIS SORT

01:59:28.794 --> 01:59:30.696
OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT BE BETTER

01:59:30.763 --> 01:59:32.331
SPENT ELSEWHERE? AND CONCLUSION,

01:59:32.398 --> 01:59:33.733
GIVEN THE ABSENCE OF A

01:59:33.799 --> 01:59:35.001
COMPELLING REASON FOR INCREASING

01:59:35.067 --> 01:59:37.336
THESE PENALTIES, THE FACT THAT

01:59:37.403 --> 01:59:38.404
EVIDENCE INDICATES INCREASING

01:59:38.471 --> 01:59:39.906
THESE PENALTIES DOES NOTHING TO

01:59:39.972 --> 01:59:41.207
DETER CRIME AND THE STATE'S

01:59:41.274 --> 01:59:43.309
HISTORY OF PRISON OVERCROWDING.

01:59:43.376 --> 01:59:45.177
WE DO NOT BELIEVE THIS BILL IS

01:59:45.244 --> 01:59:47.413
NECESSARY. FOR THESE REASONS, WE

01:59:47.480 --> 01:59:48.848
RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR NO VOTE

01:59:48.915 --> 01:59:51.651

WE'RE STILL IN OPPOSITION. THANK

02:00:50.876 --> 02:00:53.346
YOU. ARIANA MONTES, ON BEHALF OF

02:00:53.412 --> 02:00:55.548
THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR

02:00:55.615 --> 02:00:59.385
CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN OPPOSITION.

02:00:59.452 --> 02:01:00.720
WONDERFUL. ANYONE ELSE HOPING TO

02:01:00.786 --> 02:01:03.789
BE HEARD ON THE BILL? OKAY.

02:01:03.856 --> 02:01:05.625
SEEING NONE, I WILL TURN IT BACK

02:01:05.691 --> 02:01:06.325
TO THE DAIS. QUESTIONS OR

02:01:06.392 --> 02:01:07.259
COMMENTS? ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

02:01:07.326 --> 02:01:08.761
LACKEY. YOU CAN BEGIN. YEAH,

02:01:08.828 --> 02:01:11.397
JUST A QUICK COMMENT. I, I FIND

02:01:11.464 --> 02:01:14.033
IT ALARMING, ACTUALLY, THAT

02:01:14.100 --> 02:01:15.234
DISMISSING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR

02:01:15.301 --> 02:01:17.236
SUCH A DECEPTIVE, HURTFUL

02:01:17.303 --> 02:01:19.572
PRACTICE, IT'S BEWILDERING TO

02:01:19.639 --> 02:01:23.876
ME. AND WE HAVE, YOU KNOW, WHEN

02:01:23.943 --> 02:01:27.446
WE TALK ABOUT JUSTICE AND THE

02:01:27.513 --> 02:01:29.148
SCALES OF JUSTICE AND THE

02:01:29.215 --> 02:01:31.617
BALANCE THAT'S THAT'S REQUIRED,

02:01:31.684 --> 02:01:34.720
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

02:01:34.787 --> 02:01:39.025
UNDERSTAND THAT. PENALTY IS PART

02:01:39.091 --> 02:01:42.328
OF JUSTICE. AND THERE ARE MANY

02:01:42.395 --> 02:01:44.030
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO COMPLETELY

02:01:44.096 --> 02:01:47.166
DISMISS THE PUNITIVE NATURE OF

02:01:47.233 --> 02:01:51.570
LAWS. THEY'RE PART OF JUSTICE.

02:01:51.637 --> 02:01:54.440
AND SO TO DISMISS AND TO

02:01:54.507 --> 02:01:57.343
DISCOUNT DECEIVING THE PUBLIC

02:01:57.410 --> 02:01:59.178
DURING A TIME OF CRISIS THAT

02:01:59.245 --> 02:02:01.614
YOU'RE A PUBLIC OFFICIAL. IF

02:02:01.681 --> 02:02:03.049
THAT DOESN'T ALARM YOU, WE'RE IN

02:02:03.115 --> 02:02:05.618
TROUBLE. I CLEARLY SUPPORT THIS

02:02:05.685 --> 02:02:07.787
MEASURE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU,

02:02:07.853 --> 02:02:09.522
MR. LACKEY. OTHER QUESTIONS OR

02:02:09.588 --> 02:02:11.724
COMMENTS FROM THE DAIS? WE HAVE

02:02:11.791 --> 02:02:14.527
A MOTION BY ALANIS, SECOND BY

02:02:14.593 --> 02:02:17.530
NGUYEN. ANY OTHER DISCUSSION?

02:02:17.596 --> 02:02:18.898
SEEING NONE. SENATOR ARCHULETTA,

02:02:18.964 --> 02:02:20.366
WOULD YOU LIKE TO PROVIDE A

02:02:20.433 --> 02:02:22.134
BRIEF CLOSING? YES, I THINK, MR.

02:02:22.201 --> 02:02:23.402
CHAIR. NORMALLY I WOULD JUST

02:02:23.469 --> 02:02:24.904
QUICKLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND

02:02:24.970 --> 02:02:26.605
WALK OUT. BUT I'VE GOT TO SHARE

02:02:26.672 --> 02:02:29.709
WITH YOU THAT I WALKED THE

02:02:29.775 --> 02:02:32.978
STREETS OF ALTADENA, THE

02:02:33.045 --> 02:02:35.081
PALISADES, AS THINGS WERE

02:02:35.147 --> 02:02:37.883
SMOLDERING, AND THE SWAT

02:02:37.950 --> 02:02:39.719
COMMANDER, A FRIEND OF MINE,

02:02:39.785 --> 02:02:41.587
ALLOWED ME TO JUMP IN HIS UNIT,

02:02:41.654 --> 02:02:44.490
AND WE TOURED THE AREA AND I

02:02:44.557 --> 02:02:47.359
LITERALLY SAW FAMILIES CRYING.

02:02:47.426 --> 02:02:49.662
AND IN THE MIDST OF IT ALL,

02:02:49.729 --> 02:02:51.163
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I WITNESSED

02:02:51.230 --> 02:02:53.532
AN INDIVIDUAL WALKING BY WITH A

02:02:53.599 --> 02:02:56.001
YELLOW VEST AND HIGHWAY PATROL

02:02:56.068 --> 02:02:58.137
UNIT PULLED HIM OVER. HE DID NOT

02:02:58.204 --> 02:02:59.905
BELONG IN THE AREA. HE DID NOT

02:02:59.972 --> 02:03:01.807
WORK FOR A UTILITY COMPANY, AND

02:03:01.874 --> 02:03:04.009
HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T WORK FOR A

02:03:04.076 --> 02:03:04.977
CONSTRUCTION COMPANY. AND THEY

02:03:05.044 --> 02:03:07.446
CALLED BACKUP. AND THEY AND THEY

02:03:07.513 --> 02:03:09.749
TOOK THAT INDIVIDUAL AWAY. WHAT

02:03:09.815 --> 02:03:12.284
AUDACITY AT THAT MOMENT TO BE

02:03:12.351 --> 02:03:13.686
THERE. AND THIS IS WHAT WE'RE

02:03:13.753 --> 02:03:15.454
TRYING TO DO, HELP THOSE

02:03:15.521 --> 02:03:16.722
COMMUNITIES THAT NEED HELP. AND

02:03:16.789 --> 02:03:18.424
I THINK THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

02:03:18.491 --> 02:03:20.493
AND EVERY ONE OF US ELECTED GOT

02:03:20.559 --> 02:03:22.628
TO BAND TOGETHER TO PROTECT OUR

02:03:22.695 --> 02:03:25.097
CITIZENS. AND THIS IS A GOOD WAY

02:03:25.164 --> 02:03:25.898
TO START. SO WITH THAT, I DO

02:03:25.965 --> 02:03:28.467
URGE FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK

02:03:28.534 --> 02:03:29.769
YOU VERY MUCH, SENATOR. THANK

02:03:29.835 --> 02:03:30.803
YOU, EVERYONE, FOR YOUR

02:03:30.870 --> 02:03:31.971
TESTIMONY TODAY. COLLEAGUES, THE

02:03:32.037 --> 02:03:33.105
CHAIR IS RECOMMENDING AN AYE.

02:03:33.172 --> 02:03:34.573
AND I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR

02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:36.642
AND ALL OF YOUR COAUTHORS FOR

02:03:36.709 --> 02:03:37.743
WORKING SO CLOSELY WITH OUR

02:03:37.810 --> 02:03:38.811
OFFICE TO STRIKE THE RIGHT

02:03:38.878 --> 02:03:40.212
BALANCE AND LAND THIS PLANE, I

02:03:40.279 --> 02:03:41.847
THINK, IN A PRETTY GOOD SPOT,

02:03:41.914 --> 02:03:42.815
NOTWITHSTANDING ONGOING

02:03:42.882 --> 02:03:44.116
QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS THAT THERE

02:03:44.183 --> 02:03:46.185
MIGHT BE. WITH THAT, WE HAVE A

02:03:46.252 --> 02:03:46.886
MOTION. AND A SECOND. LET'S

02:03:46.952 --> 02:03:50.322
CONDUCT THE ROLL ON SB 571 BY

02:03:50.389 --> 02:03:51.557
SENATOR ARCHULETA. THE MOTION IS

02:03:51.624 --> 02:03:53.292
DUE PASS, AS AMENDED, TO THE

02:03:53.359 --> 02:03:54.360
APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE.

02:03:54.426 --> 02:03:57.530
SCHULTZ. SCHULTZ I L L I

02:03:57.596 --> 02:04:02.668
GONZALEZ. HANEY. LACKEY. LACKEY.

02:04:02.735 --> 02:04:07.006
I NGUYEN. NGUYEN I RAMOS. RAMOS.

02:04:07.072 --> 02:04:10.543
I SHARPE. COLLINS. OKAY, THAT

02:04:10.609 --> 02:04:12.444
MEASURE IS OUT. WE'LL KEEP IT ON

02:04:12.511 --> 02:04:14.280
CALL SO PEOPLE CAN ADD ON. THANK

02:04:14.346 --> 02:04:17.082
YOU, SENATOR ARCHULETA. NEXT I

02:04:17.149 --> 02:04:18.651
SEE IN TERMS OF SIGN IN ORDER,

02:04:18.717 --> 02:04:20.319
WE HAVE SENATOR WIENER AND THEN

02:04:20.386 --> 02:04:21.387
WE HAVE SENATOR SENATOR DURAZZO

02:04:21.453 --> 02:04:22.888
NEXT IN THE HOPPER. SENATOR

02:04:22.955 --> 02:04:24.957
WIENER, WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO

02:04:25.024 --> 02:04:27.159
START WITH ITEM NUMBER 16?

02:04:27.226 --> 02:04:29.562
THAT'S SENATE BILL 627. YES.

02:04:29.628 --> 02:04:31.764
OKAY. PERFECT. THAT WILL BE THE

02:04:31.831 --> 02:04:33.632
ORDER. YOUR TIME BEGINS WHEN

02:04:33.699 --> 02:04:48.981
YOU'RE READY, SIR.

02:04:49.048 --> 02:04:53.252
OKAY, GREAT. THANK YOU FOR

02:04:53.319 --> 02:04:57.289
COMING. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR.

02:04:57.356 --> 02:05:00.993
I'M HERE TODAY. EXCUSE ME. THANK

02:05:01.060 --> 02:05:03.195
YOU, MR. CHAIR. I'M HERE TODAY

02:05:03.262 --> 02:05:05.598
TO PRESENT SENATE BILL 627.

02:05:05.664 --> 02:05:07.032
FIRST, I WANT TO THANK THE

02:05:07.099 --> 02:05:08.367
COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US,

02:05:08.434 --> 02:05:11.637
AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE

02:05:11.704 --> 02:05:13.439
COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. SO THANK

02:05:13.505 --> 02:05:20.446
YOU. SENATE BILL 627 PROHIBITS

02:05:20.512 --> 02:05:24.083
LAW ENFORCEMENT AT ALL LEVELS

02:05:24.149 --> 02:05:27.186
FROM ENGAGING IN EXTREME

02:05:27.253 --> 02:05:32.224
MASKING, WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS.

02:05:32.291 --> 02:05:34.093
THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT

02:05:34.159 --> 02:05:35.494
PREVENTING LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM

02:05:35.561 --> 02:05:39.398
ENGAGING IN THEIR TYPICAL WORK.

02:05:39.465 --> 02:05:42.268
IT IS ABOUT PREVENTING EXTREME

02:05:42.334 --> 02:05:45.437
MASKING THAT IS CAUSING TERROR

02:05:45.504 --> 02:05:48.641
IN OUR COMMUNITIES. JUST TO PUT

02:05:48.707 --> 02:05:51.710
IT REALLY SIMPLY, WHEN SOMEONE

02:05:51.777 --> 02:05:54.613
IS ENGAGING WITH YOU, YOU SHOULD

02:05:54.680 --> 02:05:56.315
BE ABLE TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE

02:05:56.382 --> 02:05:57.950
ABOUT WHETHER THAT PERSON IS A

02:05:58.017 --> 02:05:59.985
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER OR

02:06:00.052 --> 02:06:01.520
WHETHER THEY'RE A GUY WITH A SKI

02:06:01.587 --> 02:06:03.555
MASK ROBBING A LIQUOR STORE. AND

02:06:03.622 --> 02:06:06.425
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE LAW

02:06:06.492 --> 02:06:07.459
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS,

02:06:07.526 --> 02:06:09.662
PARTICULARLY ICE AGENTS, WHO ARE

02:06:09.728 --> 02:06:11.830
RUNNING AROUND EFFECTIVELY WITH

02:06:11.897 --> 02:06:13.232
SKI MASKS ON OR SOMETHING

02:06:13.299 --> 02:06:16.502
APPROACHING A SKI MASK.

02:06:16.568 --> 02:06:18.103
UNIDENTIFIED, GRABBING PEOPLE

02:06:18.170 --> 02:06:19.672
OUT OF BUS STOPS, OUT OF

02:06:19.738 --> 02:06:22.274
PEOPLE'S FRONT YARDS, OUT OF

02:06:22.341 --> 02:06:24.610
WORK SITES AND THROWING THEM

02:06:24.677 --> 02:06:26.478
INTO UNMARKED VEHICLES AND

02:06:26.545 --> 02:06:29.815
TAKING THEM GOD KNOWS WHERE. AND

02:06:29.882 --> 02:06:31.317
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T EVEN

02:06:31.383 --> 02:06:32.651
EFFECTIVELY TRACK PEOPLE IN THE

02:06:32.718 --> 02:06:34.787
SYSTEM ANYMORE, WE DON'T EVEN

02:06:34.853 --> 02:06:38.190
KNOW WHERE PEOPLE ARE, WHETHER

02:06:38.257 --> 02:06:39.892
THEY'RE AT THIS ALLIGATOR

02:06:39.959 --> 02:06:42.127
ALCATRAZ OR AT A GULAG IN EL

02:06:42.194 --> 02:06:44.596
SALVADOR, OR NOW IN LIBYA OR

02:06:44.663 --> 02:06:48.200
SOUTH SUDAN. THE LEVEL OF TERROR

02:06:48.267 --> 02:06:49.902
BEING INFLICTED ON COMMUNITIES

02:06:49.969 --> 02:06:54.239
IN CALIFORNIA IS EXTRAORDINARY,

02:06:54.306 --> 02:06:56.575
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS

02:06:56.642 --> 02:06:59.411
HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO BE

02:06:59.478 --> 02:07:01.280
ACTUALLY BUILDING TRUST WITH

02:07:01.347 --> 02:07:03.215
COMMUNITIES AND NOT RUNNING

02:07:03.282 --> 02:07:06.652
AROUND WITH SKI MASKS ON. AND IT

02:07:06.719 --> 02:07:08.721
IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING FOR SO

02:07:08.787 --> 02:07:10.889
MANY PEOPLE, AND IT IS TEARING

02:07:10.956 --> 02:07:13.726
COMMUNITIES APART. IT IS TEARING

02:07:13.792 --> 02:07:18.697
FAMILIES APART. AND SB 627 WILL

02:07:18.764 --> 02:07:22.134
HELP PUT A STOP TO IT. SB 627

02:07:22.201 --> 02:07:24.169
DOES NOT CATEGORICALLY BAN ALL

02:07:24.236 --> 02:07:26.472
MASKING, STILL ALLOWS FOR

02:07:26.538 --> 02:07:27.639
MASKING OR MASKING TO PROTECT

02:07:27.706 --> 02:07:29.608
YOURSELF AGAINST SMOKE. IT

02:07:29.675 --> 02:07:31.910
DOESN'T DO ANYTHING TO STOP

02:07:31.977 --> 02:07:34.313
OFFICERS FROM USING FACE SHIELDS

02:07:34.380 --> 02:07:36.415
THAT ARE TRANSPARENT, AS YOU

02:07:36.482 --> 02:07:40.052
MIGHT HAVE IN A RIOT SITUATION.

02:07:40.119 --> 02:07:43.622
IT ALLOWS FOR SWAT TEAM MEMBERS

02:07:43.689 --> 02:07:45.391
TO USE MASKING TO PROTECT THEIR

02:07:45.457 --> 02:07:48.761
FACES, AND IT HAS AN EXCEPTION

02:07:48.827 --> 02:07:51.196
FOR UNDERCOVER WORK. BUT THE

02:07:51.263 --> 02:07:52.998
SITUATION THAT WE SEE NOW WITH

02:07:53.065 --> 02:07:55.134
THIS EXTREME FORM OF MASKING,

02:07:55.200 --> 02:07:56.702
GRABBING PEOPLE ON THE STREETS,

02:07:56.769 --> 02:07:58.971
IT IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE.

02:07:59.038 --> 02:08:03.909
AND IT'S TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO

02:08:03.976 --> 02:08:10.282
TAKE ACTION. WE ARE IN AN

02:08:10.349 --> 02:08:12.818
UNPRECEDENTED TIME IN THIS

02:08:12.885 --> 02:08:15.320
COUNTRY AND IN CALIFORNIA. THE

02:08:15.387 --> 02:08:17.923
FACT THAT A FEDERAL COURT FELT

02:08:17.990 --> 02:08:22.161
THE NEED TO ISSUE AN INJUNCTION

02:08:22.227 --> 02:08:25.397
SAYING THAT ICE SHOULD NOT BE

02:08:25.464 --> 02:08:26.832
DETAINING AND ARRESTING PEOPLE

02:08:26.899 --> 02:08:28.667
BECAUSE THEY ARE LATINO OR

02:08:28.734 --> 02:08:30.102
BECAUSE THEY'RE SPEAKING

02:08:30.169 --> 02:08:31.203
SPANISH. I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD

02:08:31.270 --> 02:08:32.571
SEE SUCH A COURT ORDER IN MY

02:08:32.638 --> 02:08:35.074
ENTIRE LIFE. AND YET THAT'S

02:08:35.140 --> 02:08:37.276
WHERE WE ARE, AND THEY'RE

02:08:37.342 --> 02:08:39.812
APPEALING THAT ORDER. SO WE NEED

02:08:39.878 --> 02:08:41.613
TO TAKE STEPS HERE IN THE

02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:43.082
LEGISLATURE TO PROTECT THE

02:08:43.148 --> 02:08:46.919
SAFETY OF CALIFORNIANS. AND THAT

02:08:46.985 --> 02:08:49.154
INCLUDES PUTTING A STOP TO THIS

02:08:49.221 --> 02:08:51.423
EXTREME FORM OF MASKING THAT IS

02:08:51.490 --> 02:08:53.358
DOING NOTHING OTHER THAN

02:08:53.425 --> 02:08:55.160
GENERATE TERROR IN OUR

02:08:55.227 --> 02:08:57.496
COMMUNITIES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK

02:08:57.563 --> 02:08:59.398
FOR AN AYE VOTE, AND WITH ME

02:08:59.465 --> 02:09:00.966
TODAY TO TESTIFY IS CHRISTINE

02:09:01.033 --> 02:09:02.134
SOTO DEBERRY, THE EXECUTIVE

02:09:02.201 --> 02:09:04.002
DIRECTOR OF THE PROSECUTORS

02:09:04.069 --> 02:09:06.872
ALLIANCE, AND LINA ALFARO, A

02:09:06.939 --> 02:09:07.873
VOLUNTEER FOR THE INLAND

02:09:07.940 --> 02:09:09.508
COALITION FOR IMMIGRANT JUSTICE

02:09:09.575 --> 02:09:10.909
AND A LEGAL OBSERVER FOR THE

02:09:10.976 --> 02:09:14.012
RAPID RESPONSE NETWORK FOR THE

02:09:14.079 --> 02:09:17.616
INLAND EMPIRE. GOOD MORNING,

02:09:17.683 --> 02:09:19.551
CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR

02:09:19.618 --> 02:09:20.452
HEARING US HERE TODAY. MY NAME

02:09:20.519 --> 02:09:22.421
IS CHRISTINE SOTO. I'M THE

02:09:22.488 --> 02:09:23.422
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF

02:09:23.489 --> 02:09:24.690
PROSECUTORS ALLIANCE ACTION,

02:09:24.756 --> 02:09:26.625
WHERE I HAVE BEEN AFTER

02:09:26.692 --> 02:09:27.726
COMPLETING A DECADE IN THE SAN

02:09:27.793 --> 02:09:29.528
FRANCISCO DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S

02:09:29.595 --> 02:09:31.230
OFFICE, AND WE'RE PROUD TO BE A

02:09:31.296 --> 02:09:33.165
SPONSOR OF SB 627, A CRITICAL

02:09:33.232 --> 02:09:34.600
PIECE OF LEGISLATION, AS YOU

02:09:34.666 --> 02:09:36.668
JUST HEARD, TO PROTECT BOTH THE

02:09:36.735 --> 02:09:38.070
PUBLIC AND LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:09:38.137 --> 02:09:39.872
ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THE

02:09:39.938 --> 02:09:41.006
IMMIGRATION RAIDS THAT WE'VE

02:09:41.073 --> 02:09:44.610
SEEN ACROSS OUR STATE BY MASKED,

02:09:44.676 --> 02:09:46.745
ANONYMOUS FEDERAL AGENTS HAVE

02:09:46.812 --> 02:09:49.014
SHATTERED PUBLIC TRUST, AND THEY

02:09:49.081 --> 02:09:50.749
ARE MAKING EVERY COMMUNITY LESS

02:09:50.816 --> 02:09:52.885
SAFE. WHEN A FEDERAL AGENT SHOWS

02:09:52.951 --> 02:09:54.686
UP IN OUR COMMUNITIES IN PLAIN

02:09:54.753 --> 02:09:56.255
CLOTHES OR IN A GENERIC VEST

02:09:56.321 --> 02:09:58.657
WITH NO NAME, NO BADGE AND A

02:09:58.724 --> 02:10:00.425
COVERED FACE, THE PUBLIC HAS NO

02:10:00.492 --> 02:10:02.661
WAY TO KNOW IF THEY ARE DEALING

02:10:02.728 --> 02:10:05.164
WITH A FEDERAL, STATE, OR LOCAL

02:10:05.230 --> 02:10:06.932
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER OR EVEN

02:10:06.999 --> 02:10:09.868
AN IMPOSTER. THAT CONFUSION DOES

02:10:09.935 --> 02:10:11.970
NOT JUST ERODE TRUST IN FEDERAL

02:10:12.037 --> 02:10:13.038
OFFICERS. IT UNDERMINES

02:10:13.105 --> 02:10:15.874
CONFIDENCE IN EVERY OFFICER THAT

02:10:15.941 --> 02:10:18.110
SERVES US. WHEN COMMUNITIES

02:10:18.177 --> 02:10:19.278
DON'T TRUST LAW ENFORCEMENT,

02:10:19.344 --> 02:10:21.313
THEY DON'T REPORT CRIME. THEY

02:10:21.380 --> 02:10:23.148
DON'T COOPERATE WITH

02:10:23.215 --> 02:10:24.149
INVESTIGATIONS, AND THEY DON'T

02:10:24.216 --> 02:10:26.718
SEEK HELP. THAT PUTS EVERYONE,

02:10:26.785 --> 02:10:28.487
INCLUDING OFFICERS, AT GREATER

02:10:28.554 --> 02:10:30.322
RISK. CALIFORNIA HAS NOT ONLY

02:10:30.389 --> 02:10:33.525
THE RIGHT, BUT THE OBLIGATION TO

02:10:33.592 --> 02:10:35.727
SET BASELINE PROTECTIONS FOR OUR

02:10:35.794 --> 02:10:37.129
RESIDENTS. THAT MEANS ENSURING

02:10:37.196 --> 02:10:40.332
NO OFFICER, FEDERAL, STATE OR

02:10:40.399 --> 02:10:42.234
LOCAL OPERATES MASKED AND

02:10:42.301 --> 02:10:44.069
ANONYMOUSLY IN OUR COMMUNITIES.

02:10:44.136 --> 02:10:47.272
SB 627 ESTABLISHES CRITICAL

02:10:47.339 --> 02:10:48.674
GUARDRAILS NOW AND FOR THE

02:10:48.740 --> 02:10:50.475
FUTURE, WHILE ALSO CARVING OUT

02:10:50.542 --> 02:10:52.311
APPROPRIATE EXEMPTIONS TO ENSURE

02:10:52.377 --> 02:10:54.046
OFFICERS CAN CONTINUE TO PROTECT

02:10:54.112 --> 02:10:55.981
THEIR FACES WHEN NEEDED FOR

02:10:56.048 --> 02:10:58.083
HEALTH AND SAFETY REASONS. THIS

02:10:58.150 --> 02:11:00.919
BILL IS A PROACTIVE MEASURE MADE

02:11:00.986 --> 02:11:02.287
TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA NEVER

02:11:02.354 --> 02:11:04.156
SLIDES INTO A REALITY WHERE

02:11:04.223 --> 02:11:06.692
SECRET POLICE TACTICS BECOME

02:11:06.758 --> 02:11:07.993
NORMALIZED. IN CALIFORNIA, WE

02:11:08.060 --> 02:11:09.995
DON'T DO SECRET POLICE, WE DON'T

02:11:10.062 --> 02:11:12.397
DO SECRET ARRESTS, AND THIS

02:11:12.464 --> 02:11:13.465
LEGISLATION WILL TAKE THAT

02:11:13.532 --> 02:11:16.335
PRINCIPLE AND CODIFY IT IN LAW.

02:11:16.401 --> 02:11:20.806
WE ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. GOOD

02:11:20.872 --> 02:11:23.642
MORNING, ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. I

02:11:23.709 --> 02:11:25.344
FIRST WANT TO THANK SENATOR

02:11:25.410 --> 02:11:26.945
WIENER AND ALL THE CO-SPONSORS

02:11:27.012 --> 02:11:30.415
OF SB 627 FOR BRAVELY ADDRESSING

02:11:30.482 --> 02:11:32.951
THE FEAR OF OUR COMMUNITIES. MY

02:11:33.018 --> 02:11:36.088
NAME IS LENA ALFARO. I HAVE BEEN

02:11:36.154 --> 02:11:37.990
A RESIDENT OF RIVERSIDE FOR OVER

02:11:38.056 --> 02:11:40.792
30 YEARS. RIVERSIDE IS MY

02:11:40.859 --> 02:11:42.227
COMMUNITY. IT IS WHERE MY

02:11:42.294 --> 02:11:44.062
HUSBAND AND I ARE RAISING OUR

02:11:44.129 --> 02:11:46.298
FIVE YEAR OLD SON, AND IT IS

02:11:46.365 --> 02:11:48.000
WHERE I'VE BEEN A TEACHER FOR

02:11:48.066 --> 02:11:49.868
THE PAST EIGHT YEARS, SINCE THE

02:11:49.935 --> 02:11:51.937
SECOND TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, I

02:11:52.004 --> 02:11:52.971
HAVE SEEN LOVED ONES AND

02:11:53.038 --> 02:11:56.942
NEIGHBORS TERRORIZED BY UNLAWFUL

02:11:57.009 --> 02:12:00.178
AND INHUMANE IMMIGRATION RAIDS.

02:12:00.245 --> 02:12:02.447
I KNEW I HAD TO DO MORE, SO I

02:12:02.514 --> 02:12:03.882
DECIDED TO VOLUNTEER FOR THE

02:12:03.949 --> 02:12:05.617
INLAND COALITION FOR IMMIGRANT

02:12:05.684 --> 02:12:07.786
JUSTICE, WHO MANAGES THE RAPID

02:12:07.853 --> 02:12:09.454
RESPONSE NETWORK IN THE INLAND

02:12:09.521 --> 02:12:11.556
EMPIRE. I AM NOW A LEGAL

02:12:11.623 --> 02:12:13.292
OBSERVER TRAINED TO RESPOND TO

02:12:13.358 --> 02:12:14.226
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT

02:12:14.293 --> 02:12:15.661
SIGHTINGS AND CONNECT COMMUNITY

02:12:15.727 --> 02:12:18.263
MEMBERS TO RESOURCES. ON

02:12:18.330 --> 02:12:20.799
FATHER'S DAY, MY FAMILY AND I

02:12:20.866 --> 02:12:22.968
STOPPED TO FUEL UP AT A GAS

02:12:23.035 --> 02:12:24.236
STATION IN RIVERSIDE. IT WAS

02:12:24.303 --> 02:12:26.505
THERE WHERE I SAW FOUR UNMARKED

02:12:26.571 --> 02:12:28.340
VEHICLES AND FIVE MASKED

02:12:28.407 --> 02:12:31.043
IMMIGRATION AGENTS AGENTS WHO

02:12:31.109 --> 02:12:34.012
HAD TWO SCARED INDIVIDUALS

02:12:34.079 --> 02:12:36.882
HANDCUFFED. I BEGAN RECORDING

02:12:36.948 --> 02:12:38.450
AND INFORMED THE DETAINEES OF

02:12:38.517 --> 02:12:40.519
THEIR RIGHTS, TELLING THEM NOT

02:12:40.585 --> 02:12:42.287
TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND NOT

02:12:42.354 --> 02:12:44.356
TO SIGN ANY DOCUMENTS WITHOUT

02:12:44.423 --> 02:12:46.892
CONSULTING A LAWYER. THE AGENTS

02:12:46.958 --> 02:12:50.562
WERE GATOR AND BALACLAVA MASKS

02:12:50.629 --> 02:12:53.165
WITH HATS AND SUNGLASSES TO

02:12:53.231 --> 02:12:56.034
DISGUISE THEIR IDENTITIES. AS I

02:12:56.101 --> 02:12:58.103
RECORDED, A MASS AGENT TOLD ME

02:12:58.170 --> 02:13:00.672
TO STAND BACK. I MOVED FARTHER

02:13:00.739 --> 02:13:03.575
BACK TO COMPLY, BUT THE OFFICER

02:13:03.642 --> 02:13:04.976
WAS STILL AGGRESSIVE AND HE EVEN

02:13:05.043 --> 02:13:08.213
PUSHED ME. I WAS SCARED FOR WHAT

02:13:08.280 --> 02:13:11.149
THESE MASKED AGENTS MAY DO TO ME

02:13:11.216 --> 02:13:12.918
FOR SIMPLY DOCUMENTING THEIR

02:13:12.984 --> 02:13:15.587
BEHAVIOR. THIS IS JUST ONE

02:13:15.654 --> 02:13:16.822
EXAMPLE OF MANY UNLAWFUL

02:13:16.888 --> 02:13:18.757
OPERATION OPERATIONS HAPPENING

02:13:18.824 --> 02:13:20.058
ACROSS THE STATE, IN WHICH

02:13:20.125 --> 02:13:22.027
MASKED AGENTS DISGUISE THEIR

02:13:22.094 --> 02:13:24.196
IDENTITIES IN ORDER TO ABUSE

02:13:24.262 --> 02:13:25.630
THEIR POWERS AND MISTREAT

02:13:25.697 --> 02:13:28.367
PEOPLE, DISGUISING THEIR

02:13:28.433 --> 02:13:29.701
IDENTITIES MAKES THESE

02:13:29.768 --> 02:13:32.237
OPERATIONS MORE HOSTILE AND LESS

02:13:32.304 --> 02:13:34.539
SAFE FOR EVERYONE, INCLUDING

02:13:34.606 --> 02:13:36.508
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. IT RAISES

02:13:36.575 --> 02:13:38.844
THE QUESTION OF WHO IS A

02:13:38.910 --> 02:13:41.012
LEGITIMATE AGENT OR AN

02:13:41.079 --> 02:13:43.181
IMPERSONATOR. OVERALL, I HEAR

02:13:43.248 --> 02:13:45.016
DIRECTLY FROM OUR COMMUNITY THAT

02:13:45.083 --> 02:13:47.386
THIS HAS LED TO FEAR AND

02:13:47.452 --> 02:13:49.721
MISTRUST OF ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT.

02:13:49.788 --> 02:13:51.456
FOR THOSE REASONS, I HOPE THIS

02:13:51.523 --> 02:13:54.893
COMMITTEE WILL SUPPORT THIS BILL

02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:58.063

HERE, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO SPEAK

02:18:33.405 --> 02:18:34.673
TO THOSE. SO THE BOTTOM LINE IS

02:18:34.739 --> 02:18:36.541
THIS BILL MAKES IT NOW MAKES IT

02:18:36.608 --> 02:18:39.944
A CRIME FOR AN OFFICER TO WEAR A

02:18:40.011 --> 02:18:41.546
MASK. I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR

02:18:41.613 --> 02:18:44.783
ABOUT THAT. WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

02:18:44.849 --> 02:18:48.453
CALIFORNIA IS UNFORTUNATE. WE

02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:49.988
JUST PROTECT THEMSELVES. I WON'T

02:18:50.055 --> 02:18:53.158
SPEAK FOR OTHER GROUPS. HAS PUT

02:18:53.224 --> 02:18:56.528
OUT TO THE PUBLIC THAT A LOT OF

02:18:56.594 --> 02:18:58.963
THE TACTICS ARE OCCURRING. AND

02:18:59.030 --> 02:19:01.533
IN CALIFORNIA BY THE FEDERAL

02:19:01.599 --> 02:19:04.936
GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENTS IS

02:19:05.003 --> 02:19:07.572
INAPPROPRIATE. ALSO, PORAC WAS

02:19:07.639 --> 02:19:08.973
PART OF A LETTER THAT WENT

02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:10.909
DIRECTLY TO THE U.S. ATTORNEY

02:19:10.975 --> 02:19:12.911
GENERAL PREVIOUSLY THAT SAID

02:19:12.977 --> 02:19:16.114
THAT WE DO NOT AND WILL NOT

02:19:16.181 --> 02:19:19.384
ENFORCE IMMIGRATION LAWS, THAT

02:19:19.451 --> 02:19:20.452
THAT'S FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

02:19:20.518 --> 02:19:23.054
THEY'RE NOT IT'S NOT THE JOB OF

02:19:23.121 --> 02:19:24.422
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND THEY

02:19:24.489 --> 02:19:27.325
ARE NOT TRAINED TO DO SO. THE

02:19:27.392 --> 02:19:29.427
THINGS THAT YOU'RE SEEING ON TV,

02:19:29.494 --> 02:19:31.196
THE STORIES HERE TODAY BY THE

02:19:31.262 --> 02:19:34.232
AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS ARE

02:19:34.299 --> 02:19:38.169
TRAGIC, BUT THEY ARE ABOUT

02:19:38.236 --> 02:19:41.272
FEDERAL AGENTS. IF THE AUTHOR

02:19:41.339 --> 02:19:42.674
WANTS TO GO AFTER THE FEDERAL

02:19:42.741 --> 02:19:45.043
AGENTS AND TRY TO DO SOMETHING

02:19:45.110 --> 02:19:47.212
ABOUT WHAT IS OCCURRING HERE IN

02:19:47.278 --> 02:19:48.980
CALIFORNIA, THE BILL SHOULD DO

02:19:49.047 --> 02:19:51.883
THAT. THE PROBLEM IS THE BILL.

02:19:51.950 --> 02:19:53.918
AND IN THE TESTIMONY FROM THE

02:19:53.985 --> 02:19:56.287
AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS, THEY

02:19:56.354 --> 02:19:57.922
TALK ABOUT THESE INCIDENTS,

02:19:57.989 --> 02:20:00.425
THESE INCIDENCES, YET THEY USE

02:20:00.492 --> 02:20:02.260
THE TERM LAW ENFORCEMENT. LAW

02:20:02.327 --> 02:20:03.828
ENFORCEMENT IS DOING THIS. LAW

02:20:03.895 --> 02:20:05.363
ENFORCEMENT DO THAT. CALIFORNIA

02:20:05.430 --> 02:20:07.298
LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE NOT WEARING

02:20:07.365 --> 02:20:09.601
SKI MASKS AND GRABBING PEOPLE

02:20:09.667 --> 02:20:12.070
OUT OF CHURCHES, SYNAGOGUES AND

02:20:12.137 --> 02:20:14.139
THEIR HOMES. THEY'RE NOT DOING

02:20:14.205 --> 02:20:16.641
IT. THE ONLY TIME YOU WILL SEE

02:20:16.708 --> 02:20:18.910
THEM OUT THERE IS IF THEY ARE

02:20:18.977 --> 02:20:20.311
BEING CALLED BY THE FEDERAL

02:20:20.378 --> 02:20:22.480
AGENTS. FOR OFFICERS WHO ARE IN

02:20:22.547 --> 02:20:25.250
TROUBLE OR IN DANGER, THEY HAVE

02:20:25.316 --> 02:20:27.485
TO REPORT TO THAT JUST LIKE ANY

02:20:27.552 --> 02:20:29.721
OTHER PERSON IN THIS ROOM OR IN

02:20:29.788 --> 02:20:33.057
THE STATE MAKES THAT SAME CALL.

02:20:33.124 --> 02:20:34.192
THEY'RE GOING TO THEY'RE GOING

02:20:34.259 --> 02:20:37.595
TO COME OUT. SO I JUST WANT TO

02:20:37.662 --> 02:20:40.899
BE VERY CLEAR. OUR OFFICERS ARE

02:20:40.965 --> 02:20:42.967
PART OF THIS BILL. WE ARE BEING

02:20:43.034 --> 02:20:46.171
SWEPT INTO THIS ISSUE WHEN WE DO

02:20:46.237 --> 02:20:48.273
NOT WANT TO ENFORCE IMMIGRATION.

02:20:48.339 --> 02:20:50.141
AND WE HAVE BEEN PUBLICLY CLEAR

02:20:50.208 --> 02:20:53.144
ABOUT IT. SO WE'RE HOPING THAT

02:20:53.211 --> 02:20:55.547
THIS BILL DOESN'T MOVE. WE'RE

02:20:55.613 --> 02:20:57.382
HOPING THAT WE CAN SIT DOWN AND

02:20:57.448 --> 02:21:00.118
WORK ON PEOPLE WHO ARE IMITATING

02:21:00.185 --> 02:21:03.955
POLICE OFFICERS, PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:21:04.022 --> 02:21:06.758
ILLEGALLY ENFORCING SOME

02:21:06.825 --> 02:21:07.826
IMMIGRATION RULES, PEOPLE WHO

02:21:07.892 --> 02:21:09.494
ARE BEING HIRED AS BOUNTY

02:21:09.561 --> 02:21:13.264
HUNTERS. LET'S GO AFTER THEM, IS

02:21:13.331 --> 02:21:15.033
GOING TO SUPPORT A BILL COMING

02:21:15.099 --> 02:21:17.702
UP TODAY, SB 805, THAT DOES A

02:21:17.769 --> 02:21:19.470
LOT OF THOSE THINGS. WE ARE

02:21:19.537 --> 02:21:22.574
GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL. SO WE

02:21:22.640 --> 02:21:24.776
ARE ASKING THIS BILL NOT MOVE.

02:21:24.843 --> 02:21:26.511
THIS IS THE WRONG WAY, AND IT'S

02:21:26.578 --> 02:21:28.613
GOING AFTER OUR OFFICERS WITH A

02:21:28.680 --> 02:21:30.949
CRIME. INSTEAD OF TALKING TO US

02:21:31.015 --> 02:21:33.585
ABOUT MANDATE THAT ALL AGENCIES

02:21:33.651 --> 02:21:35.286
HAVE TO HAVE POLICIES AND THAT

02:21:35.353 --> 02:21:36.955
THOSE POLICIES HAVE TO BE

02:21:37.021 --> 02:21:38.456
FOLLOWED. IF AN OFFICER DOES

02:21:38.523 --> 02:21:40.191
SOMETHING AND WEARS A MASK

02:21:40.258 --> 02:21:41.693
ILLEGALLY, PER THOSE POLICIES,

02:21:41.759 --> 02:21:43.494
THEY'LL BE DISCIPLINED. AND

02:21:43.561 --> 02:21:44.996
THAT'S THE REALITY. WE'RE

02:21:45.063 --> 02:21:47.065
ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO THIS BILL.

02:21:47.131 --> 02:21:48.933
THANK YOU. YOU HAVE ABOUT A

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:50.168
MINUTE AND 40S REMAINING. I'LL

02:21:50.235 --> 02:21:52.370
BE QUICK. DON'T NEED TO REPEAT A

02:21:52.437 --> 02:21:54.472
LOT OF WHAT MY COLLEAGUE JUST

02:21:54.539 --> 02:21:55.540
ARTICULATED, BUT WE SHARE THE

02:21:55.607 --> 02:21:56.507
SAME SENTIMENT AND DO WANT TO

02:21:56.574 --> 02:21:58.543
TALK TO THE SPECIFIC POLICY IN

02:21:58.610 --> 02:21:59.744
THE BILL. I MEAN, THERE ARE

02:21:59.811 --> 02:22:01.412
EXEMPTIONS IN THE BILL FOR WHEN

02:22:01.479 --> 02:22:03.281
YOU CAN MASK, BUT THEY'RE TOO

02:22:03.348 --> 02:22:03.882
NARROW AND THEY DON'T ACCOUNT

02:22:03.948 --> 02:22:05.750
FOR A LOT OF THINGS THAT AN

02:22:05.817 --> 02:22:07.452
OFFICER WOULD LEGITIMATELY WANT

02:22:07.518 --> 02:22:08.019
TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM

02:22:08.086 --> 02:22:09.354
EXTREME ELEMENTS SANDSTORMS,

02:22:09.420 --> 02:22:10.622
WINDSTORMS. THERE'S A NARROW

02:22:10.688 --> 02:22:12.423
EXEMPTION FOR CERTAIN SMOKE ONLY

02:22:12.490 --> 02:22:13.892
IN DECLARED STATES OF EMERGENCY.

02:22:13.958 --> 02:22:15.426
BUT OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE FIRES

02:22:15.493 --> 02:22:17.996
OUTSIDE OF THOSE TYPES OF

02:22:18.062 --> 02:22:18.997
SITUATIONS. BUT AS AS THE

02:22:19.063 --> 02:22:20.031
REPRESENTATIVE FROM PORK

02:22:20.098 --> 02:22:20.932
MENTIONED SITTING HERE, WE KNOW

02:22:20.999 --> 02:22:22.400
THAT THIS IS NOT ABOUT LOCAL

02:22:22.467 --> 02:22:24.102
STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND IF IT

02:22:24.168 --> 02:22:25.937
IS, THERE'S BETTER WAYS TO

02:22:26.004 --> 02:22:27.238
ADDRESS THAT THAN CREATING

02:22:27.305 --> 02:22:28.706
CRIMES THAT ACTUALLY THREATEN

02:22:28.773 --> 02:22:32.010
OFFICERS WITH JAIL SENTENCES.

02:22:32.076 --> 02:22:33.344
AND I DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE

02:22:33.411 --> 02:22:35.580
FIRST VIOLATION UNDER THE BILL

02:22:35.647 --> 02:22:37.015
WOULD BE AN INFRACTION, BUT THE

02:22:37.081 --> 02:22:38.616
SECOND WOULD BE A MISDEMEANOR.

02:22:38.683 --> 02:22:40.018
AND THAT'S WHOLLY INAPPROPRIATE

02:22:40.084 --> 02:22:43.621
IN OUR MIND. AND EVEN IF, AGAIN,

02:22:43.688 --> 02:22:44.789
IF WE WORK THROUGH ALL THE

02:22:44.856 --> 02:22:45.657
DIFFERENT EXEMPTIONS, THAT WOULD

02:22:45.723 --> 02:22:47.725
HAVE TO BE INCLUDED, YOU KNOW,

02:22:47.792 --> 02:22:50.695
CREATING A CRIME TO PLACE

02:22:50.762 --> 02:22:53.231
OFFICERS IN CUSTODY OVER

02:22:53.298 --> 02:22:54.499
LEGITIMATE REASONS FOR COVERING

02:22:54.565 --> 02:22:55.566
THEIR FACES, NOT WHAT WE'RE

02:22:55.633 --> 02:22:57.735
TALKING ABOUT, NOT THE FEDERAL

02:22:57.802 --> 02:22:58.436
OFFICERS THAT ARE OUT THERE

02:22:58.503 --> 02:23:01.839
CAUSING THE ISSUES WE THINK IS

02:23:01.906 --> 02:23:05.910
UNFITTING AT BEST. AND AS

02:23:05.977 --> 02:23:06.711
COLLEAGUE MENTIONED, WE ARE

02:23:06.778 --> 02:23:08.613
WORKING TO TRY AND ADDRESS SOME

02:23:08.680 --> 02:23:09.514
OF THESE ISSUES. TON OF EMPATHY

02:23:09.580 --> 02:23:11.249
WITH WHAT THE OFFICER AUTHOR

02:23:11.316 --> 02:23:12.350
BROUGHT UP AND THE WITNESSES

02:23:12.417 --> 02:23:14.152
TODAY. WE UNDERSTAND IT IS WHY

02:23:14.218 --> 02:23:15.520
CAL CHIEFS WORKED ON OUR

02:23:15.586 --> 02:23:17.388
ORIGINAL SANCTUARY STATE BILL IN

02:23:17.455 --> 02:23:18.756
2016 TO CREATE THAT BALANCE, TO

02:23:18.823 --> 02:23:20.792
REALLY DEFINE LAW ENFORCEMENT,

02:23:20.858 --> 02:23:22.460
LOCAL STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT'S

02:23:22.527 --> 02:23:24.162
ROLE, AND THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN

02:23:24.228 --> 02:23:25.763
COLLABORATING WITH THE FEDERAL

02:23:25.830 --> 02:23:27.165
GOVERNMENT AND THESE TYPES OF

02:23:27.231 --> 02:23:28.666
SITUATIONS, AND WILL CONTINUE TO

02:23:28.733 --> 02:23:29.600
WORK TO TRY AND ADDRESS SOME OF

02:23:29.667 --> 02:23:31.536
THE CONCERNS AND FEARS FROM THE

02:23:31.602 --> 02:23:32.704
COMMUNITIES. WE ARE PART OF THE

02:23:32.770 --> 02:23:34.605
COMMUNITY, WE FEEL IT TOO. BUT

02:23:34.672 --> 02:23:35.673
UNFORTUNATELY THE POLICY HERE IS

02:23:35.740 --> 02:23:37.675
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN'T AGREE

02:23:37.742 --> 02:23:38.676
WITH. SO RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A

02:23:38.743 --> 02:23:41.112
NO VOTE. GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU

02:23:41.179 --> 02:23:42.613

02:23:42.680 --> 02:23:45.049
GO TOO FAR. THERE MAY BE

02:23:45.116 --> 02:23:46.584
QUESTIONS. LET'S TAKE THE ME

WORKING WITH IMMIGRANTS,

02:25:35.293 --> 02:25:37.395
REFUGEES AND UNDOCUMENTED

02:25:37.462 --> 02:25:39.163
COMMUNITY. AND WHAT'S HAPPENING

02:25:39.230 --> 02:25:42.366
RIGHT NOW IS A TRAGEDY. IT'S

02:25:42.433 --> 02:25:44.202
HEARTBREAKING. IT REALLY IS. AND

02:25:44.268 --> 02:25:47.472
I UNDERSTAND THE BILL AND I

02:25:47.538 --> 02:25:50.007
LISTENED TO BOTH OF YOUR

02:25:50.074 --> 02:25:50.975
TESTIMONIES, AND WHAT I HEARD A

02:25:51.042 --> 02:25:53.845
LOT OF WAS AGENTS, FEDERAL

02:25:53.911 --> 02:25:55.746
AGENTS. AND I SEE THAT NOT ONLY

02:25:55.813 --> 02:25:57.949
DO I SEE IT ON SOCIAL MEDIA, ON

02:25:58.015 --> 02:26:01.119
THE NEWS, BUT ALSO I GET TO HEAR

02:26:01.185 --> 02:26:02.487
EVERY SINGLE DAY, ALMOST ON AN

02:26:02.553 --> 02:26:04.355
HOURLY BASIS, ABOUT THESE

02:26:04.422 --> 02:26:05.823
DEVASTATING STORIES THAT ARE

02:26:05.890 --> 02:26:07.291
HAPPENING RIGHT DOWN THE STREET

02:26:07.358 --> 02:26:08.993
FROM WHERE I LIVE, IN THE

02:26:09.060 --> 02:26:10.761
COMMUNITIES IN WHERE I LIVE IN.

02:26:10.828 --> 02:26:13.030
BUT YOUR TESTIMONY AGAIN TALKED

02:26:13.097 --> 02:26:16.234
ABOUT FEDERAL AGENTS, AND WHAT

02:26:16.300 --> 02:26:19.504
WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS DISPEL A

02:26:19.570 --> 02:26:21.005
LOT OF THE MISINFORMATION THAT'S

02:26:21.072 --> 02:26:22.406
OUT THERE IN OUR COMMUNITY,

02:26:22.473 --> 02:26:24.108
STATING THAT OUR LOCAL LAW

02:26:24.175 --> 02:26:25.610
ENFORCEMENT ARE ENGAGING IN A

02:26:25.676 --> 02:26:27.745
LOT OF THESE RAIDS. I CAN'T TELL

02:26:27.812 --> 02:26:31.048
YOU HOW MANY TIMES I'VE HAD TO

02:26:31.115 --> 02:26:33.151
LET FOLKS KNOW THAT LOCAL LAW

02:26:33.217 --> 02:26:36.487
ENFORCEMENT DOES NOT, DOES NOT

02:26:36.554 --> 02:26:38.856
ENGAGE IN RAIDS. THEY DO NOT GO

02:26:38.923 --> 02:26:40.925
INTO SYNAGOGUES AND CHURCHES AND

02:26:40.992 --> 02:26:42.160
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS

02:26:42.226 --> 02:26:45.830
AND SHELTERS AND ARREST AND FIND

02:26:45.897 --> 02:26:49.000
THOSE THAT ARE UNDOCUMENTED. I

02:26:49.066 --> 02:26:50.902
SPOKE TO MANY OF OUR LOCAL LAW

02:26:50.968 --> 02:26:53.070
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES JUST TO

02:26:53.137 --> 02:26:54.772
CLARIFY THAT, JUST TO MAKE SURE

02:26:54.839 --> 02:26:57.208
THAT I HEAR IT DIRECTLY FROM

02:26:57.275 --> 02:26:59.343
THEM. WHILE I UNDERSTAND THE

02:26:59.410 --> 02:27:01.712
BILL AND WANTING TO BE ABLE TO

02:27:01.779 --> 02:27:04.115
IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS, I GO BACK

02:27:04.182 --> 02:27:05.983
TO, THIS IS MORE AT THE FEDERAL

02:27:06.050 --> 02:27:07.718
LEVEL AND IT'S NOT AT THE LOCAL

02:27:07.785 --> 02:27:09.921
LEVEL. AND WE HAVE TRIED FOR

02:27:09.987 --> 02:27:12.123
MANY YEARS TO BUILD THIS TRUST

02:27:12.190 --> 02:27:14.158
WITH OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.

02:27:14.225 --> 02:27:16.694
WE'VE DONE MANY THINGS LIKE

02:27:16.761 --> 02:27:18.062
COMMUNITY OUTREACH, MAKING SURE

02:27:18.129 --> 02:27:19.931
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IS THERE.

02:27:19.997 --> 02:27:22.033
I FEEL LIKE THIS BILL IS

02:27:22.099 --> 02:27:25.369
ACTUALLY PUSHING THAT ASIDE AND

02:27:25.436 --> 02:27:27.905
MAKING FOLKS THINK THAT OUR

02:27:27.972 --> 02:27:30.441
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENGAGE IN

02:27:30.508 --> 02:27:32.210
SUCH THINGS WHILE WE'RE TRYING

02:27:32.276 --> 02:27:34.345
SO HARD TO ENSURE THAT THEY

02:27:34.412 --> 02:27:35.546
UNDERSTAND THAT, THAT THAT IS

02:27:35.613 --> 02:27:38.849
NOT THE CASE MENTIONED EARLIER

02:27:38.916 --> 02:27:43.020
IS SB 802, WHICH I FEEL LIKE IS

02:27:43.087 --> 02:27:44.922
ONE THAT IS GOING TO DEFINITELY

02:27:44.989 --> 02:27:47.225
IDENTIFY WITH THE NAME Ã BADGE

02:27:47.291 --> 02:27:48.492
WHATNOT. RIGHT. AND THAT'S WHAT

02:27:48.559 --> 02:27:49.927
WE'RE TRYING TO GO AFTER IS

02:27:49.994 --> 02:27:52.063
ENSURING THAT WE GET TO IDENTIFY

02:27:52.129 --> 02:27:54.999
THESE INDIVIDUALS. AND EIGHT 805

02:27:55.066 --> 02:27:56.767
IS THAT WHICH IS ONE THAT I WILL

02:27:56.834 --> 02:27:59.837
BE SUPPORTING. I JUST THINK THIS

02:27:59.904 --> 02:28:02.840
ONE HERE IS REALLY MAKING IT

02:28:02.907 --> 02:28:05.443
DIFFICULT FOR US TO CONTINUE TO

02:28:05.509 --> 02:28:07.878
LET OUR COMMUNITIES KNOW THAT

02:28:07.945 --> 02:28:09.680
OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NOT

02:28:09.747 --> 02:28:11.449
A PART OF THIS. NOW, AS

02:28:11.515 --> 02:28:13.284
MENTIONED, THEY MAY BE CALLED TO

02:28:13.351 --> 02:28:14.919
ASSIST IN A SITUATION WHERE IT

02:28:14.986 --> 02:28:18.623
IS DANGEROUS LIKE IN ANY OTHER

02:28:18.689 --> 02:28:19.991
SITUATIONS. BUT IN THIS

02:28:20.057 --> 02:28:21.859
SITUATION, AS WE ARE ENFORCING

02:28:21.926 --> 02:28:23.594
THIS, IT REALLY MAKES IT SEEM

02:28:23.661 --> 02:28:26.163
LIKE WE ARE PITTING LOCAL LAW

02:28:26.230 --> 02:28:29.800
ENFORCEMENT IN A SITUATION IN

02:28:29.867 --> 02:28:31.135
WHICH THEY ARE NOT THERE, THEY

02:28:31.202 --> 02:28:32.603
ARE NOT THERE. THIS IS AT THE

02:28:32.670 --> 02:28:34.905
FEDERAL LEVEL, AND I BELIEVE

02:28:34.972 --> 02:28:37.441
THIS IS AN AREA IN WHICH WE NEED

02:28:37.508 --> 02:28:40.111
TO ATTACK AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL,

02:28:40.177 --> 02:28:40.978
NOT HERE AT THE STATE LEVEL. AND

02:28:41.045 --> 02:28:42.713
SENATOR, FOR THAT REASON, I WILL

02:28:42.780 --> 02:28:43.814
BE LAYING OFF TODAY. I

02:28:43.881 --> 02:28:44.782
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

02:28:44.849 --> 02:28:46.550
DO, AND I COMMEND YOU FOR WHAT

02:28:46.617 --> 02:28:48.286
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO BECAUSE WE

02:28:48.352 --> 02:28:50.187
WANT TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY

02:28:50.254 --> 02:28:51.689
FOLKS. BUT I BELIEVE THAT 805

02:28:51.756 --> 02:28:53.090
REALLY, TRULY DOES DO SOMETHING

02:28:53.157 --> 02:28:56.827
WHERE NAME AGENCY, FACE

02:28:56.894 --> 02:28:59.363
EVERYTHING. AND I'LL LEAVE IT AT

02:28:59.430 --> 02:29:00.531
THAT, BECAUSE I'M SURE THERE

02:29:00.598 --> 02:29:02.633
WILL BE OTHERS THAT WANT TO

02:29:02.700 --> 02:29:03.668
SPEAK AS WELL TOO. THANK YOU

02:29:03.734 --> 02:29:04.669
VERY MUCH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:29:04.735 --> 02:29:06.037

02:29:16.347 --> 02:29:18.382
JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS MASK

02:29:18.449 --> 02:29:22.119
USAGE? I HAVE CERTAINLY HEARD

02:29:22.186 --> 02:29:25.890
WHAT ICE HAS SAID. WHAT

02:29:25.956 --> 02:29:29.560
SECRETARY NOEM HAS SAID, IN

02:29:29.627 --> 02:29:31.395
ADDITION TO ALL THE OTHER

02:29:31.462 --> 02:29:33.164
INCREDIBLY DESPICABLE AND

02:29:33.230 --> 02:29:34.699
OFFENSIVE THINGS THAT SHE AND

02:29:34.765 --> 02:29:36.834
THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE SAID

02:29:36.901 --> 02:29:39.704
ABOUT IMMIGRANTS, ABOUT BROAD

02:29:39.770 --> 02:29:42.206
BRUSHING, TEN PLUS MILLION

02:29:42.273 --> 02:29:44.709
RESIDENTS OF THIS COUNTRY AS

02:29:44.775 --> 02:29:46.243
CRIMINALS AND THEN RUNNING

02:29:46.310 --> 02:29:49.180
AROUND GRABBING MOTHERS SO THAT

02:29:49.246 --> 02:29:49.880
THEIR KIDS DON'T KNOW WHERE

02:29:49.947 --> 02:29:53.651
THEIR MOMS ARE, SENDING PEOPLE.

02:29:53.718 --> 02:29:55.820

THE OTHER DISGUSTING THINGS THAT

02:29:58.389 --> 02:30:00.591
THEY ARE DOING. SO NO, WE'VE NOT

02:30:00.658 --> 02:30:01.926
SPOKEN TO ICE, BUT I'VE HEARD

02:30:01.992 --> 02:30:04.829
WHAT THEY HAVE SAID AND YOU

02:30:04.895 --> 02:30:07.031
KNOW, IT DOES NOT IN ANY WAY

02:30:07.098 --> 02:30:10.601
EXCUSE SENDING PEOPLE WITH

02:30:10.668 --> 02:30:13.504
EFFECTIVELY SKI MASKS ON INTO

02:30:13.571 --> 02:30:14.705
COMMUNITIES TO GRAB PEOPLE AND

02:30:14.772 --> 02:30:16.774
PUT THEM IN UNMARKED VEHICLES.

02:30:16.841 --> 02:30:18.876
IT DOESN'T EXCUSE IT, BUT I JUST

02:30:18.943 --> 02:30:20.945
WANT TO CONFIRM THE FACT YOU

02:30:21.011 --> 02:30:22.413
HAVE NOT PERSONALLY REACHED OUT.

02:30:22.480 --> 02:30:24.248
THAT IS CORRECT. WE HAVE NOT

02:31:24.975 --> 02:31:26.577
IN CARS THAT ARE ENTIRELY

02:31:26.644 --> 02:31:29.780
UNMARKED, YOU KNOW, MINIVANS,

02:31:29.847 --> 02:31:33.150
ENTIRELY UN RECOGNIZABLE AS LAW

02:31:33.217 --> 02:31:36.287
ENFORCEMENT, FULLY MASKED, NO

02:31:36.353 --> 02:31:38.422
BADGE VISIBLE, NO NAME VISIBLE.

02:31:38.489 --> 02:31:40.624
IT GOES AGAINST EVERYTHING WE

02:31:40.691 --> 02:31:42.426
KNOW ABOUT HOW LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:31:42.493 --> 02:31:43.928
SHOULD BE OPERATING IN OUR

02:31:43.994 --> 02:31:47.131
STATE. IT, AS YOU SAID, VIOLATES

02:31:47.198 --> 02:31:51.001
TRUST. IT PUTS NOT ONLY

02:31:51.068 --> 02:31:52.503
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE BEING PULLED

02:31:52.570 --> 02:31:54.939
AWAY IN WAYS THAT MAKE IT LOOK

02:31:55.005 --> 02:31:55.739
LIKE THEY'RE BEING KIDNAPED IN

02:31:55.806 --> 02:31:57.541
DANGER. IT PUTS THOSE OFFICERS

02:31:57.608 --> 02:32:00.110
IN DANGER. IT PUTS OUR LOCAL AND

02:32:00.177 --> 02:32:01.479
STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT IN DANGER.

02:32:01.545 --> 02:32:02.680
HOW ARE THEY? HOW ARE OUR LOCAL

02:32:02.746 --> 02:32:04.782
AND STATE OFFICERS SUPPOSED TO

02:32:04.849 --> 02:32:06.250
KNOW THAT THESE FOLKS ARE

02:32:06.317 --> 02:32:07.218
ACTUALLY FEDERAL LAW

02:32:07.284 --> 02:32:08.719
ENFORCEMENT, THAT IT'S

02:32:08.786 --> 02:32:10.287
INEVITABLE THAT THERE'S GOING TO

02:32:10.354 --> 02:32:13.424
BE PEOPLE WHO GET HURT BECAUSE

02:32:13.491 --> 02:32:14.792
MISTAKES ARE MADE AND

02:32:14.859 --> 02:32:15.860
MISUNDERSTANDING IS BUILT IN BY

02:32:15.926 --> 02:32:17.328
DESIGN. WHEN PEOPLE ARE NOT

02:32:17.394 --> 02:32:19.129
IDENTIFYING THEMSELVES AS LAW

02:32:19.196 --> 02:32:20.564
ENFORCEMENT. NOT TO MENTION, OF

02:32:20.631 --> 02:32:22.233
COURSE, MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE

02:32:22.299 --> 02:32:24.201
ABSOLUTE TERROR THAT IT IS

02:32:24.268 --> 02:32:26.637
BRINGING AROUND OUR COMMUNITIES,

02:32:26.704 --> 02:32:28.606
PEOPLE WHO JUST WANT TO GO TO

02:32:28.672 --> 02:32:29.907
WORK, JUST WANT TO LIVE THEIR

02:32:29.974 --> 02:32:33.077
LIVES AND ARE BEING ATTACKED

02:32:33.143 --> 02:32:35.079
WITH NO UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS

02:32:35.145 --> 02:32:36.547
IS EVEN A LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTION

02:32:36.614 --> 02:32:38.849
OR A FEDERAL IMMIGRATION ACTION.

02:32:38.916 --> 02:32:42.453
SO WHAT I WHAT I WANTED WANTED

02:32:42.520 --> 02:32:45.756
TO ASK YOU AND, AND FIRST OF ALL

02:32:45.823 --> 02:32:47.992
COMMEND YOU FOR TAKING THIS ON

02:32:48.058 --> 02:32:49.360
IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND

02:32:49.426 --> 02:32:51.428
REALLY TERRIFYING REALITY THAT

02:32:51.495 --> 02:32:54.365
WE'RE FACING. YOU KNOW, I THINK

02:32:54.431 --> 02:32:55.900
THAT THIS QUESTION OF HOW WE GET

02:32:55.966 --> 02:32:57.968
AT WHAT IS HAPPENING AND WHAT

02:32:58.035 --> 02:33:00.070
THE ACTUAL CONCERN IS AROUND THE

02:33:00.137 --> 02:33:03.107
FEDERAL IMMIGRATION ACTIONS THAT

02:33:03.173 --> 02:33:05.843
ARE ENTIRELY DESPICABLE AND

02:33:05.910 --> 02:33:07.678
UNACCEPTABLE AND HOW WE SEPARATE

02:33:07.745 --> 02:33:10.915
THAT AND FROM WHAT STATE AND LAW

02:33:10.981 --> 02:33:15.286
ENFORCEMENT ARE DOING, IS THIS

02:33:15.352 --> 02:33:17.821
IN TERMS OF HOW THIS IS WRITTEN

02:33:17.888 --> 02:33:20.691
NOW? ARE THERE CONCERNS ABOUT

02:33:20.758 --> 02:33:23.193
THIS SORT OF BEHAVIOR AND THESE

02:33:23.260 --> 02:33:26.397
TYPES OF THIS TYPE OF ENGAGEMENT

02:33:26.463 --> 02:33:29.266
AROUND MASKING AMONG STATE AND

02:33:29.333 --> 02:33:30.467
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AS WELL?

02:33:30.534 --> 02:33:33.604
ARE THERE EXAMPLES THAT WE ARE

02:33:33.671 --> 02:33:35.839
WE ARE TRYING TO ALSO PREVENT OR

02:33:35.906 --> 02:33:38.375
GAPS IN THE LAW. AND IF YOU

02:33:38.442 --> 02:33:40.044
COULD SPEAK, SPEAK TO THAT AND

02:33:40.110 --> 02:33:42.880
ALSO THE WAYS IN WHICH WE WILL

02:33:42.947 --> 02:33:44.281
EVEN BE ABLE TO APPLY THIS TO,

02:33:44.348 --> 02:33:45.749
TO FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT, WILL

02:33:45.816 --> 02:33:49.687
THIS BE ENFORCEABLE AGAINST WHAT

02:33:49.753 --> 02:33:51.522
WE'RE SEEING, WHICH IS THE, YOU

02:33:51.589 --> 02:33:54.024
KNOW, THE AWFUL EXAMPLES THAT

02:33:54.091 --> 02:33:55.459
WE, YOU KNOW, TRULY NEED TO

02:33:55.526 --> 02:33:57.394
PREVENT IN OUR STATE? YEAH.

02:33:57.461 --> 02:33:59.763
THANK YOU FOR THAT. YOU KNOW, I

02:33:59.830 --> 02:34:00.531
FIRST OF ALL, WANT TO

02:34:00.598 --> 02:34:01.565
ACKNOWLEDGE THIS IS AN

02:34:01.632 --> 02:34:04.134
INCREDIBLY HARD TIME FOR STATE

02:34:04.201 --> 02:34:05.369
AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO

02:34:05.436 --> 02:34:08.105
HAVE TO DEAL WITH A BUNCH OF

02:34:08.172 --> 02:34:10.574
FASCIST THUGS COMING INTO OUR

02:34:10.641 --> 02:34:13.510
COMMUNITIES AND ENGAGING IN THIS

02:34:13.577 --> 02:34:17.014
JUST TRULY VILE BEHAVIOR. IT

02:34:17.081 --> 02:34:19.583
GIVES A BLACK EYE TO ALL OF LAW

02:34:19.650 --> 02:34:21.785
ENFORCEMENT, AND IT CAUSES A

02:34:21.852 --> 02:34:23.587
LACK IT. IT DESTROYS TRUST IN

02:34:23.654 --> 02:34:26.123
LAW ENFORCEMENT. SO I, YOU KNOW,

02:34:26.190 --> 02:34:27.558
FOR OUR STATE, LOCAL LAW

02:34:27.625 --> 02:34:28.726
ENFORCEMENT WHO WORK SO HARD

02:34:28.792 --> 02:34:29.760
EVERY DAY TO BUILD COMMUNITY

02:34:29.827 --> 02:34:32.363
TRUST AND TRY TO DO THE RIGHT

02:34:32.429 --> 02:34:34.331
THING TO HAVE THESE, THESE THUGS

02:34:34.398 --> 02:34:38.736
COME IN AND DO THIS. I CAN ONLY

02:34:38.802 --> 02:34:41.872
IMAGINE HOW DEMORALIZING THAT IS

02:34:41.939 --> 02:34:44.808
FOR OUR OWN OFFICERS WHO WE ALL

02:34:44.875 --> 02:34:47.277
SUPPORT THIS. THIS BILL IS NOT

02:34:47.344 --> 02:34:49.780
ABOUT SAYING WE'RE SOMEHOW

02:34:49.847 --> 02:34:52.049
LUMPING IN STATE AND LOCAL LAW

02:34:52.116 --> 02:34:53.117
ENFORCEMENT AND CLAIMING THAT

02:34:53.183 --> 02:34:54.218
THEY'RE OR INSINUATING THAT

02:34:54.284 --> 02:34:56.654
THEY'RE DOING WHAT ICE IS DOING

02:34:56.720 --> 02:34:59.823
RIGHT NOW. THIS IS ABOUT SETTING

02:34:59.890 --> 02:35:02.192
STANDARDS THAT WE EXPECT OF ANY

02:35:02.259 --> 02:35:04.895
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. ICE WAS

02:35:04.962 --> 02:35:07.164
NOT ICE AGENTS, AS FAR AS I

02:35:07.231 --> 02:35:09.900
KNOW, WERE NOT WEARING SKI MASKS

02:35:09.967 --> 02:35:11.735
UNTIL THEY WERE WEARING SKI

02:35:11.802 --> 02:35:15.039
MASKS. AND SO NOW WE HAVE TO

02:35:15.105 --> 02:35:18.575
DEAL WITH THAT. AND I DON'T WANT

02:35:18.642 --> 02:35:20.544
TO EVEN ENVISION A FUTURE WHERE

02:35:20.611 --> 02:35:23.714
THAT BECOMES SOMEHOW NORMAL,

02:35:23.781 --> 02:35:24.848
NORMALIZED, OR ACCEPTABLE FOR

02:35:24.915 --> 02:35:26.917
LAW ENFORCEMENT TO EVER EVEN

02:35:26.984 --> 02:35:29.386
CONSIDER OPERATING IN THAT WAY.

02:35:29.453 --> 02:35:31.922
AND SO IF WE'RE IF WE'RE SETTING

02:35:31.989 --> 02:35:33.557
STANDARDS, AS I THINK WE SHOULD,

02:35:33.624 --> 02:35:34.458
WHETHER IT'S IN SENATOR PEREZ'S

02:35:34.525 --> 02:35:35.793
BILL, WHICH I FULLY SUPPORT,

02:35:35.859 --> 02:35:37.561
WHICH I'M A JOINT AUTHOR OF, OR

02:35:37.628 --> 02:35:39.897
IN THIS BILL, WE SHOULD SET IT

02:35:39.963 --> 02:35:41.298
FOR ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:35:41.365 --> 02:35:43.100
OFFICERS. WE HAVE PUT EXEMPTIONS

02:35:43.167 --> 02:35:45.202
IN THE BILL. WE HAVE WELCOMED

02:35:45.269 --> 02:35:46.837
ADDITIONAL FEEDBACK. OBVIOUSLY,

02:35:46.904 --> 02:35:48.338
WE'RE ON A SHORTER TIME FRAME.

02:35:48.405 --> 02:35:49.606
WE DID NOT ANTICIPATE HAVING TO

02:35:49.673 --> 02:35:52.543
DO THIS LEGISLATION IN JANUARY.

02:35:52.609 --> 02:35:54.678
I DID NOT ANTICIPATE THE SCALE

02:35:54.745 --> 02:35:56.914
OF WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE

02:35:56.980 --> 02:35:58.749
DOING IN PARTS OF THE STATE, AND

02:35:58.816 --> 02:36:01.318
THE EXTREME DISGUISES THAT

02:36:01.385 --> 02:36:03.120
THEY'RE EFFECTIVELY WEARING. SO

02:36:03.187 --> 02:36:05.122
I DO THINK IT MAKES SENSE FOR

02:36:05.189 --> 02:36:07.891
THE STANDARDS TO APPLY TO

02:36:07.958 --> 02:36:11.528
EVERYONE. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT

02:36:11.595 --> 02:36:13.764
THAT DONALD TRUMP AND HIS

02:36:13.831 --> 02:36:15.899
ADMINISTRATION WANT TO CONSCRIPT

02:36:15.966 --> 02:36:17.634
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DO

02:36:17.701 --> 02:36:18.802
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT WHENEVER

02:36:18.869 --> 02:36:22.005
WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT GOING AFTER

02:36:22.072 --> 02:36:23.407
SANCTUARY JURISDICTIONS OR

02:36:23.474 --> 02:36:25.275
DEFUNDING SANCTUARY

02:36:25.342 --> 02:36:27.344
JURISDICTIONS, THAT IS THAT WHAT

02:36:27.411 --> 02:36:29.580
THEY'RE SAYING IS THEY WANT TO

02:36:29.646 --> 02:36:31.682
BE ABLE TO COERCE CITIES AND

02:36:31.749 --> 02:36:33.484
STATES AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:36:33.550 --> 02:36:35.819
INTO PARTICIPATING IN

02:36:35.886 --> 02:36:36.520
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT, WHICH

02:36:36.587 --> 02:36:39.690
THEY DON'T WANT TO DO. SOME,

02:36:39.757 --> 02:36:41.658
SOME DO, BUT MOST DON'T. BUT

02:36:41.725 --> 02:36:43.260
THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. AND

02:36:43.327 --> 02:36:45.662
SO LET'S GET AHEAD OF THIS AND

02:36:45.729 --> 02:36:47.464
LET'S SET CLEAR RULES IN TERMS

02:36:47.531 --> 02:36:50.467
OF THE FEDERAL ISSUES. AND THIS

02:36:50.534 --> 02:36:52.569
IS IN THIS BILL AND ALSO IN

02:36:52.636 --> 02:36:55.105
SENATOR PEREZ'S BILL THERE. YOU

02:36:55.172 --> 02:36:56.640
KNOW, WE'VE HEARD SOME OF THE

02:36:56.707 --> 02:36:58.075
OPPOSITION TALK ABOUT THE

02:36:58.142 --> 02:36:59.543
FEDERALISM ISSUES. FIRST OF ALL,

02:36:59.610 --> 02:37:01.245
WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO

02:37:01.311 --> 02:37:02.613
PROTECT THE SAFETY OF

02:37:02.679 --> 02:37:04.982
CALIFORNIANS. I WISH CONGRESS

02:37:05.048 --> 02:37:06.483
WOULD DO IT. I KNOW THERE'S A

02:37:06.550 --> 02:37:09.319
SENATE, OUR OWN AMAZING SENATOR,

02:37:09.386 --> 02:37:10.621
ALEX PADILLA, HAS INTRODUCED A

02:37:10.687 --> 02:37:13.157
BILL I YOU KNOW, I HOPE AT SOME

02:37:13.223 --> 02:37:14.625
POINT THAT THAT CAN BECOME LAW.

02:37:14.691 --> 02:37:16.293
I'M NOT GOING TO HOLD MY BREATH

02:37:16.360 --> 02:37:17.961
THAT THAT'S GOING TO ROCKET

02:37:18.028 --> 02:37:18.495
THROUGH THIS PARTICULAR

02:37:18.562 --> 02:37:21.799
CONGRESS. SO WE NEED TO STEP UP

02:37:21.865 --> 02:37:24.401
AND PROTECT CALIFORNIANS. BEING

02:37:24.468 --> 02:37:26.904
A FEDERAL EMPLOYEE DOES NOT

02:37:26.970 --> 02:37:29.640
EXEMPT YOU FROM EVERY STATE LAW,

02:37:29.706 --> 02:37:30.841
AND I KNOW THIS WILL BE AN

02:37:30.908 --> 02:37:32.776
ISSUE, AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE

02:37:32.843 --> 02:37:35.179
THE COURTS TO ADJUDICATE THESE

02:37:35.245 --> 02:37:37.314
ISSUES. BUT I DO THINK THAT WE

02:37:37.381 --> 02:37:39.416
ARE NOT IN A NORMAL TIME. WE'RE

02:37:39.483 --> 02:37:40.884
AT A MOMENT IN TIME WHERE WE

02:37:40.951 --> 02:37:42.719
HAVE THE RISE OF A AUTHORITARIAN

02:37:42.786 --> 02:37:44.521
REGIME THAT'S TRYING TO JUST

02:37:44.588 --> 02:37:46.190
UPEND OUR DEMOCRACY, AND WE NEED

02:37:46.256 --> 02:37:47.524
TO STICK UP FOR CALIFORNIANS.

02:37:47.591 --> 02:37:50.327
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING.

02:37:50.394 --> 02:37:51.428
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

02:37:51.495 --> 02:37:54.097
MEMBER HANEY, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:37:54.164 --> 02:37:55.599
GONZALEZ, THERE'S A LOT. OKAY.

02:37:55.666 --> 02:37:57.634
SO LOOK, I WANT TO THANK THE

02:37:57.701 --> 02:37:58.902
AUTHOR FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND

02:37:58.969 --> 02:38:00.370
FOR PRESENTING. FIRST, I WANT TO

02:38:00.437 --> 02:38:01.305
JUST THANK THE OPPOSITION. I

02:38:01.371 --> 02:38:03.607
KNOW THAT BEING HERE TODAY IS

02:38:03.674 --> 02:38:05.042
NOT EASY. PORAC DID TAKE, HAS

02:38:05.108 --> 02:38:06.376
SENT A LETTER, HAS TAKEN A

02:38:06.443 --> 02:38:09.179
STANCE AND HAS BEEN THERE ON DAY

02:38:09.246 --> 02:38:09.746
ONE TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT

02:38:09.813 --> 02:38:10.781
THEY ARE NOT COORDINATING.

02:38:10.848 --> 02:38:12.583
THEY'RE NOT PART OF THIS AND WE

02:38:12.649 --> 02:38:14.451
HAVE TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT

02:38:14.518 --> 02:38:16.987
AS WELL. THE BILL IS NOT AN

02:38:17.054 --> 02:38:17.521
ATTACK ON LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:38:17.588 --> 02:38:18.422
WHATSOEVER. IT'S A SAFETY NET

02:38:18.488 --> 02:38:19.556
FOR OUR COMMUNITIES WHO ARE

02:38:19.623 --> 02:38:21.124
HURTING THE MOST. THERE ARE

02:38:21.191 --> 02:38:22.426
PEOPLE WHO ARE, AND WE'VE HEARD

02:38:22.492 --> 02:38:25.128
THESE STORIES EVERY SINGLE DAY,

02:38:25.195 --> 02:38:26.763
TAKEN BY A HOSTILE OVERREACH OF

02:38:26.830 --> 02:38:28.198
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGAINST

02:38:28.265 --> 02:38:30.634
OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. I AND

02:38:30.701 --> 02:38:32.369
MY PARTICULAR DISTRICT AND

02:38:32.436 --> 02:38:34.204
SENATOR RAZA, I KNOW IS IN THE

02:38:34.271 --> 02:38:36.106
AUDIENCE AS WELL. ALL OF OUR

02:38:36.173 --> 02:38:37.007
DISTRICT, MACARTHUR PARK, LITTLE

02:38:37.074 --> 02:38:38.408
TOKYO, KOREATOWN, PICO-UNION,

02:38:38.475 --> 02:38:40.043
WESTLAKE, EVERY SINGLE PART OF

02:38:40.110 --> 02:38:41.612
OUR DISTRICT IS TARGETED EVERY

02:38:41.678 --> 02:38:45.649
SINGLE DAY OF EVERY HOUR. AND

02:38:45.716 --> 02:38:47.217
THE ISSUE HERE IN THE

02:38:47.284 --> 02:38:48.819
CONVERSATION HAS BEEN ABOUT

02:38:48.886 --> 02:38:50.120
TRUST. WHEN SOMEBODY AND I'LL

02:38:50.187 --> 02:38:51.421
READ FROM WHAT HAPPENED FROM MY

02:38:51.488 --> 02:38:52.923
TEAM YESTERDAY AT 8:15 A.M.

02:38:52.990 --> 02:38:55.092
TODAY, 714 NEAR GARFIELD AND VIA

02:38:55.158 --> 02:38:56.360
CAMPO AT THE CALAVERAS

02:38:56.426 --> 02:38:57.594
RESTAURANT PARKING LOT, ICE

02:38:57.661 --> 02:38:58.662
AGENTS MASKED SURROUNDED AN

02:38:58.729 --> 02:39:00.330
EMPLOYEE IN THEIR CAR. THEY

02:39:00.397 --> 02:39:01.798
BROKE THE WINDOW AND FORCIBLY

02:39:01.865 --> 02:39:03.600
DETAINED THE INDIVIDUAL. NEARBY

02:39:03.667 --> 02:39:04.835
PRESCHOOL STAFF BEGAN RECORDING

02:39:04.902 --> 02:39:06.069
THE INCIDENT, BUT STOPPED WHEN

02:39:06.136 --> 02:39:07.905
ICE AGENTS, AGGRESSIVELY AND

02:39:07.971 --> 02:39:10.874
MASKED APPROACHED THEM. THAT IS

02:39:10.941 --> 02:39:13.343
NOT NORMAL. AND SO THE ISSUE

02:39:13.410 --> 02:39:14.845
HERE, AGAIN, IS NOT AN ATTACK ON

02:39:14.912 --> 02:39:16.880
LAW ENFORCEMENT. IT'S AN ATTACK

02:39:16.947 --> 02:39:18.448
ON THOSE WHO ARE TAKING

02:39:18.515 --> 02:39:20.484
ADVANTAGE OF BROWN COMMUNITIES.

02:39:20.550 --> 02:39:22.352
AND WE HAVE TO CALL IT WHAT IT

02:39:22.419 --> 02:39:24.221
IS. IT'S RACIST. AND WE'VE BEEN

02:39:24.288 --> 02:39:25.722
THROUGH THIS PATH BEFORE IN THIS

02:39:25.789 --> 02:39:26.957
HOUSE. AND THIS SACRAMENTO HAS

02:39:27.024 --> 02:39:28.659
CREATED LAWS IN PLACE THAT HAVE

02:39:28.725 --> 02:39:29.826
PROTECTED BLACK AND BROWN

02:39:29.893 --> 02:39:30.494
COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE BEEN

02:39:30.560 --> 02:39:32.429
VICTIMS OF BAD COPS. AND WE'VE

02:39:32.496 --> 02:39:33.330
ADDRESSED THOSE ISSUES WHEN WE

02:39:33.397 --> 02:39:34.665
WENT THROUGH GEORGE FLOYD AND

02:39:34.731 --> 02:39:35.699
OTHER ISSUES AS WELL. AND THERE

02:39:35.766 --> 02:39:37.668
ARE BILLS IN THIS, IN THIS THERE

02:39:37.734 --> 02:39:39.770
ARE EXEMPTIONS IN THIS BILL THAT

02:39:39.836 --> 02:39:41.438
THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT THE

02:39:41.505 --> 02:39:42.506
AUTHOR HAS BEEN WORKING ON AS

02:39:42.572 --> 02:39:44.007
WELL. WHEN SOMEONE BREAKS YOUR

02:39:44.074 --> 02:39:45.742
WINDOW AND YANKS YOU OUT OF A

02:39:45.809 --> 02:39:47.544
CHURCH, YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO

02:39:47.611 --> 02:39:48.145
DISTINGUISH, ARE YOU LAPD? ARE

02:39:48.211 --> 02:39:50.614
YOU A SHERIFF OR ARE YOU ICE?

02:39:50.681 --> 02:39:51.515
THEY'RE ATTACKING YOU. THEY'RE

02:39:51.581 --> 02:39:53.250
TAKING AWAY. THEY'RE KIDNAPING

02:39:53.317 --> 02:39:55.118
YOU. AND WHEN FOLKS ARE CALLING

02:39:55.185 --> 02:39:57.020
911, THEY'RE REPORTING A

02:39:57.087 --> 02:39:58.755
KIDNAPING. AND UNFORTUNATELY,

02:39:58.822 --> 02:39:59.790
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS TO

02:39:59.856 --> 02:40:01.892
SHOW UP BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO

02:40:01.959 --> 02:40:02.693
TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY AND THEN

02:40:02.759 --> 02:40:04.428
BECOMES A MISCOMMUNICATION

02:40:04.494 --> 02:40:05.595
BETWEEN ARE THEY COORDINATING

02:40:05.662 --> 02:40:07.297
VERSUS ICE COORDINATING? IF

02:40:07.364 --> 02:40:08.632
THERE'S A SEPARATION BETWEEN

02:40:08.699 --> 02:40:10.100
THOSE WHO ARE NOT WEARING MASKS

02:40:10.167 --> 02:40:11.501
AND THOSE WHO WEAR A MASK,

02:40:11.568 --> 02:40:12.536
THAT'S A DISTINCTION RIGHT THERE

02:40:12.602 --> 02:40:14.237
THAT THAT'S SOMEBODY WHO'S THERE

02:40:14.304 --> 02:40:15.505
TO PROTECT THEM AND TO SERVE,

02:40:15.572 --> 02:40:16.707
AND THAT'S SOMEONE THERE TO

02:40:16.773 --> 02:40:17.908
DETAIN THEM AGAINST THEIR WILL.

02:40:17.975 --> 02:40:19.776
AND SO WHEN YOU KEEP THOSE IN

02:40:19.843 --> 02:40:21.645
MIND AND YOU TALK ABOUT THE

02:40:21.712 --> 02:40:23.280
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FEDERAL AND

02:40:23.347 --> 02:40:24.414
LOCAL, THAT'S NOT WHAT'S ON

02:40:24.481 --> 02:40:26.817
PEOPLE'S MINDS AT THAT MOMENT.

02:40:26.883 --> 02:40:28.986
THEY ARE GETTING ATTACKED EVERY

02:40:29.052 --> 02:40:31.088
SINGLE DAY. AND WE'VE ALSO HEARD

02:40:31.154 --> 02:40:33.590
STORIES ABOUT IMPERSONATIONS,

02:40:33.657 --> 02:40:35.459
PEOPLE COMING INTO THE COMMUNITY

02:40:35.525 --> 02:40:36.526
PRETENDING TO BE LAW

02:40:36.593 --> 02:40:37.260
ENFORCEMENT, AND THESE BOUNTY

02:40:37.327 --> 02:40:39.396
HUNTERS WHO ARE GETTING PAID AND

02:40:39.463 --> 02:40:41.932
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE SYSTEM.

02:40:41.999 --> 02:40:43.734
AND I THINK THAT WE ARE WORKING

02:40:43.800 --> 02:40:45.602
WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO

02:40:45.669 --> 02:40:47.304
DISTINGUISH THOSE. BUT AT IN THE

02:40:47.371 --> 02:40:49.206
DAY, MY CONSTITUENCY SAYS EVERY

02:40:49.272 --> 02:40:51.308
DAY, WELL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING

02:40:51.375 --> 02:40:52.709
FOR US TO PROTECT US? WE'RE

02:40:52.776 --> 02:40:54.077
FARMWORKERS. AND CAMARILLO THAT

02:40:54.144 --> 02:40:56.446
WE SAW JUST LAST WEEK, PEOPLE

02:40:56.513 --> 02:40:57.748
JUST LIVING THEIR EVERY DAY

02:40:57.814 --> 02:40:59.716
LIVES AT A AT A CAR WASH OR A

02:40:59.783 --> 02:41:01.351
GAS STATION, IMMIGRANTS WHO ARE

02:41:01.418 --> 02:41:02.586
CONTRIBUTING TO THE BACKBONE OF

02:41:02.652 --> 02:41:03.954
THIS COUNTRY, WHO MADE IT WHAT

02:41:04.021 --> 02:41:06.390
IT WHAT IT IS TODAY ARE GETTING

02:41:06.456 --> 02:41:09.292
ATTACKED. THIS IS UTILIZING OUR

02:41:09.359 --> 02:41:11.128
COMMUNITIES ON A POLITICAL

02:41:11.194 --> 02:41:12.829
AGENDA THAT IS CREATING THE MOST

02:41:12.896 --> 02:41:16.533
UTMOST PROPAGANDA AT ITS FINEST

02:41:16.600 --> 02:41:18.235
FOR PEOPLE. GIVEN THE FACT THAT

02:41:18.301 --> 02:41:19.636
HIS OWN WIFE IN THIS FEDERAL

02:41:19.703 --> 02:41:20.871
ADMINISTRATION IS AN IMMIGRANT

02:41:20.937 --> 02:41:22.539
HERSELF. BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT

02:41:22.606 --> 02:41:24.041
WHITE IMMIGRANTS, IT'S ABOUT

02:41:24.107 --> 02:41:26.410
BROWN IMMIGRANTS. AND SO, AGAIN,

02:41:26.476 --> 02:41:28.145
AND A LOT OF LOCAL LAW

02:41:28.211 --> 02:41:29.513
ENFORCEMENT ARE LATINO. AND WE

02:41:29.579 --> 02:41:30.680
GOT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND RECOGNIZE

02:41:30.747 --> 02:41:32.015
THAT. AND THEY'RE GOOD UNION

02:41:32.082 --> 02:41:33.417
MEMBERS, AND THEY'RE NOT THE

02:41:33.483 --> 02:41:34.618
ONES WHO ARE ATTACKING. THEY'RE

02:41:34.684 --> 02:41:36.486
NOT THE ONES WHO ARE DOING THIS.

02:41:36.553 --> 02:41:38.188
THEY ARE TAKING ORDERS FROM A

02:41:38.255 --> 02:41:39.856
DICTATOR MASKED UP AND HIDING

02:41:39.923 --> 02:41:43.226
THEIR IDENTITY AND KIDNAPING

02:41:43.293 --> 02:41:44.928
PEOPLE AGAINST THEIR WILL FOR

02:41:44.995 --> 02:41:47.497
JUST SIMPLY GOING TO WORK, GOING

02:41:47.564 --> 02:41:49.299
TO A GRADUATION, GOING TO

02:41:49.366 --> 02:41:51.201
CHURCH, GOING TO A DIALYSIS

02:41:51.268 --> 02:41:53.170
APPOINTMENT EVERY SINGLE DAY. SO

02:41:53.236 --> 02:41:56.106
SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE. AND

02:41:56.173 --> 02:41:58.575
OUR COMMUNITY HAVING TO FIGURE

02:41:58.642 --> 02:42:00.444
OUT WHAT DO WE DO? HOW DO WE

02:42:00.510 --> 02:42:02.179
PROTECT OURSELVES? HOW DO WE

02:42:02.245 --> 02:42:03.213
SAFEGUARD OURSELVES AGAINST

02:42:03.280 --> 02:42:05.749
THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE TAKING

02:42:05.816 --> 02:42:08.018
ADVANTAGE OF THIS MOMENT FOR

02:42:08.085 --> 02:42:10.487
THEIR OWN REASON, BUT NOT

02:42:10.554 --> 02:42:12.122
DISTINGUISHING THEMSELVES IS

02:42:12.189 --> 02:42:14.891
KEY. AND SO LOOK, FOR ME, NO ONE

02:42:14.958 --> 02:42:16.059
ENFORCING THE LAW SHOULD GET TO

02:42:16.126 --> 02:42:17.561
HIDE FROM THE PEOPLE THAT THEY

02:42:17.627 --> 02:42:20.497
SERVE. THIS BILL IS ABOUT

02:42:20.564 --> 02:42:22.432
TRANSPARENCY. THIS BILL IS ABOUT

02:42:22.499 --> 02:42:23.800
ACCOUNTABILITY, AND THIS BILL IS

02:42:23.867 --> 02:42:26.436
ABOUT RESTORING TRUST BECAUSE

02:42:26.503 --> 02:42:27.838
OUR COMMUNITY DESERVES TO SEE

02:42:27.904 --> 02:42:29.473
THE FACES OF THOSE WHO ARE

02:42:29.539 --> 02:42:33.143
WIELDING POWER IN THEIR NAME.

02:42:33.210 --> 02:42:35.045
AND THIS BILL, THIS BILL SETS

02:42:35.112 --> 02:42:37.214
THE TONE THAT NO ONE IS ABOVE

02:42:37.280 --> 02:42:40.450
THE LAW. AND WITH THAT, I AM IN

02:42:40.517 --> 02:42:42.519
FULL SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. AND I

02:42:42.586 --> 02:42:43.520
WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR, AND I

02:42:43.587 --> 02:42:45.522
WANT TO THANK THOSE HERE TODAY.

02:42:45.589 --> 02:42:47.257
AND I WANT TO REEMPHASIZE THE

02:42:47.324 --> 02:42:48.959
FACT THAT IT'S NOT AGAINST YOU

02:42:49.025 --> 02:42:50.327
GUYS, IT'S AGAINST THE FEDERAL

02:42:50.393 --> 02:42:51.161
ADMINISTRATION WHO IS GUIDING

02:42:51.228 --> 02:42:54.030
THEMSELVES AS YOU AND TAKING

02:42:54.097 --> 02:42:57.033
ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION AND

02:42:57.100 --> 02:43:00.170
STEALING OUR PEOPLE AS A

02:43:00.237 --> 02:43:01.671
POLITICAL AGENDA. AND SO THIS IS

02:43:01.738 --> 02:43:03.640
A SAFEGUARD AND A SAFETY NET IN

02:43:03.707 --> 02:43:07.010
PLACE THAT REVEAL YOURSELVES,

02:43:07.077 --> 02:43:09.212
SHOW WHO YOU ARE, BECAUSE WE'VE

02:43:09.279 --> 02:43:10.981
GOT TO DO SOMETHING HERE IN

02:43:11.047 --> 02:43:13.383
CALIFORNIA TO PROTECT OUR

02:43:13.450 --> 02:43:14.551
CONSTITUENCY. AND IMMIGRANTS

02:43:14.618 --> 02:43:16.219
MADE US THE FOURTH LARGEST

02:43:16.286 --> 02:43:18.622
ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. AND THIS

02:43:18.688 --> 02:43:19.990
IS THIS FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION'S

02:43:20.056 --> 02:43:22.893
WAY OF TRYING TO KNEECAP US AND

02:43:22.959 --> 02:43:24.361
GET RID OF THE PROGRESS THAT WE

02:43:24.427 --> 02:43:26.530
HAVE MADE. AND SO THANK YOU, MR.

02:43:26.596 --> 02:43:27.964
WIENER, FOR BEING THAT BEACON OF

02:43:28.031 --> 02:43:29.733
HOPE, FOR BEING THAT GOLDEN

02:43:29.799 --> 02:43:31.368
STATE, FOR BEING THAT CALIFORNIA

02:43:31.434 --> 02:43:34.171
THAT WE KNOW. AND I AM FULLY IN

02:43:34.237 --> 02:43:36.239
SUPPORT. AND I ASK THAT I MOVE

02:43:36.306 --> 02:43:37.541
THIS BILL TODAY. THANK YOU,

02:43:37.607 --> 02:43:38.642
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ. I'LL

02:43:38.708 --> 02:43:40.544
TAKE THAT AS A MOTION. WE'LL ASK

02:43:40.610 --> 02:43:42.012
FOR A SECOND AT THE APPROPRIATE

02:43:42.078 --> 02:43:43.079
TIME. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS

02:43:43.146 --> 02:43:44.881
WELL, THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR, AND

02:43:44.948 --> 02:43:46.983
THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR

02:43:47.050 --> 02:43:49.052
BRINGING THIS THIS SITUATION

02:43:49.119 --> 02:43:52.656
FORWARD. HOWEVER, ICE AGENTS AND

02:43:52.722 --> 02:43:54.624
WHAT THE ACTIONS THAT THEY ARE

02:43:54.691 --> 02:43:56.293
DOING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

02:43:56.359 --> 02:43:58.795
ARE DEPLORING, AND IT'S NOT

02:43:58.862 --> 02:44:01.731
HUMANIZED FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE TO

02:44:01.798 --> 02:44:03.700
BE YANKED OUT OF CARS. HOWEVER,

02:44:03.767 --> 02:44:05.368
IT'S THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO

02:44:05.435 --> 02:44:08.238
YOUR BILL TO MOVE FORWARD TO GET

02:44:08.305 --> 02:44:10.040
FACE COVERINGS OFF OF FEDERAL

02:44:10.106 --> 02:44:12.876
OFFICERS, WOULD THE STATE HAVE

02:44:12.943 --> 02:44:13.743
ANY INPUT AND MAKING SURE THAT

02:44:13.810 --> 02:44:16.780
THAT TRULY DOES HAPPEN? ARE YOU

02:44:16.846 --> 02:44:18.315
TALKING ABOUT ENFORCEMENT

02:44:18.381 --> 02:44:20.550
FEDERAL OFFICERS? YEAH, IT WOULD

02:44:20.617 --> 02:44:22.953
BE A VIOLATION OF STATE LAW. AND

02:44:23.019 --> 02:44:24.454
LISTEN, I'M NOT GOING TO SIT

02:44:24.521 --> 02:44:26.489
HERE AND SAY THAT. IT'S NOT THAT

02:44:26.556 --> 02:44:28.258
IT'S GOING TO BE SUPER EASY, BUT

02:44:28.325 --> 02:44:30.560
IT WILL BE A VIOLATION OF STATE

02:44:30.627 --> 02:44:32.229
LAW, JUST LIKE THERE ARE OTHER

02:44:32.295 --> 02:44:33.463
VIOLATIONS OF STATE LAW THAT

02:44:33.530 --> 02:44:35.332
FEDERAL AGENTS CAN COMMIT AND BE

02:44:35.398 --> 02:44:37.734
HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR. BUT

02:44:37.801 --> 02:44:39.803
FEDERAL LAW YOU MENTIONED

02:44:39.869 --> 02:44:41.438
SENATOR PADILLA IS MOVING A BILL

02:44:41.504 --> 02:44:42.572
AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL HE'S

02:44:42.639 --> 02:44:44.274
INTRODUCED. SO THAT WOULD BE THE

02:44:44.341 --> 02:44:46.810
RIGHT PLACE TO HAVE, SAY, OVER

02:44:46.876 --> 02:44:49.246
FEDERAL OFFICERS. HE'S GETTING

02:44:49.312 --> 02:44:51.815
TO THE THAT PART OF IT. SO, YES,

02:44:51.881 --> 02:44:53.583
SENATOR PADILLA INTRODUCED A

02:44:53.650 --> 02:44:55.418
BILL. SO DID SEVERAL MEMBERS OF

02:44:55.485 --> 02:44:58.054
THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

02:44:58.121 --> 02:45:01.458
AND I AM ROOTING FOR THEM TO BE

02:45:01.524 --> 02:45:02.826
ABLE TO PASS THOSE BILLS. I'M

02:45:02.892 --> 02:45:05.495
ALSO NOT HOLDING MY BREATH IN

02:45:05.562 --> 02:45:06.596
THIS CONGRESS THAT THOSE BILLS

02:45:06.663 --> 02:45:09.399
ARE GOING TO ADVANCE. I HOPE

02:45:09.466 --> 02:45:10.934
THEY DO, AND I HOPE I'M WRONG.

02:45:11.001 --> 02:45:14.504
AND SO BUT REGARDLESS, WE HAVE A

02:45:14.571 --> 02:45:16.573
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT

02:45:16.640 --> 02:45:18.408
RESIDENTS OF THIS STATE, AND

02:45:18.475 --> 02:45:20.677
SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO DO THAT.

02:45:20.744 --> 02:45:22.512
AND BUT I THINK THAT THIS BILL,

02:45:22.579 --> 02:45:25.582
IN ADDITION TO SB 805 BY SENATOR

02:45:25.649 --> 02:45:28.518
PEREZ, WHICH ALSO APPLIES TO

02:45:28.585 --> 02:45:31.821
FEDERAL OFFICERS IN ADDITION TO

02:45:31.888 --> 02:45:33.890
STATE AND LOCAL OFFICERS, I'M

02:45:33.957 --> 02:45:36.393
GLAD THAT YOU'RE SUPPORTING

02:45:36.459 --> 02:45:37.827
THEM. THAT'S ALSO, QUOTE

02:45:37.894 --> 02:45:39.663
UNQUOTE, LUMPING EVERYONE

02:45:39.729 --> 02:45:40.930
TOGETHER. BUT IT'S NOT LUMPING

02:45:40.997 --> 02:45:42.832
PEOPLE TOGETHER. IT IS SETTING

02:45:42.899 --> 02:45:44.668
STANDARDS FOR ALL OFFICERS,

02:45:44.734 --> 02:45:46.036
WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE.

02:45:46.102 --> 02:45:47.337
I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR

02:45:47.404 --> 02:45:49.105
THAT CLARIFICATION THAT FEDERAL

02:45:49.172 --> 02:45:50.874
LAW PERTAINS TO FEDERAL

02:45:50.940 --> 02:45:52.275
OFFICERS. NOW, ON THE STATE

02:45:52.342 --> 02:45:54.144
SIDE, WHEN SITUATIONS DO HAPPEN

02:45:54.210 --> 02:45:55.612
AND WE HAVE TO CALL 911, IT'S

02:45:55.679 --> 02:45:57.280
OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:45:57.347 --> 02:45:58.648
OFFICERS THAT ARE RESPONDING,

02:45:58.715 --> 02:46:00.216
AND THAT'S OUR LOCAL LAW

02:46:00.283 --> 02:46:01.251
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS THAT WOULD

02:46:01.318 --> 02:46:03.053
BE INVESTIGATING, KIDNAPING ALL

02:46:03.119 --> 02:46:04.487
THESE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ARE

02:46:04.554 --> 02:46:06.356
GOING ON. AND A LOT OF TRUST

02:46:06.423 --> 02:46:08.058
THAT HAS BEEN WORKED TO BRING

02:46:08.124 --> 02:46:09.326
THE COMMUNITIES TOGETHER FOR OUR

02:46:09.392 --> 02:46:11.328
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IS

02:46:11.394 --> 02:46:13.863
SOMETHING THAT WE THINK THIS

02:46:13.930 --> 02:46:16.066
BILL NOW PAINTS EVERYBODY IN THE

02:46:16.132 --> 02:46:18.635
SAME PICTURE. WHEN WE DO AGREE

02:46:18.702 --> 02:46:21.137
THAT FEDERAL OFFICERS AND FACE

02:46:21.204 --> 02:46:22.572
MASKS AND COVERINGS AND TRYING

02:46:22.639 --> 02:46:24.007
TO FIGURE OUT IF THEY'RE TRULY

02:46:24.074 --> 02:46:25.308
FEDERAL OFFICERS OR NOT, WE'RE

02:46:25.375 --> 02:46:27.043
GOING TO BE CALLING OUR LOCAL

02:46:27.110 --> 02:46:28.812
LAW ENFORCEMENT, OUR LOCAL

02:46:28.878 --> 02:46:29.446
SHERIFFS TO INVESTIGATE THOSE,

02:46:29.512 --> 02:46:31.147
TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE, IN

02:46:31.214 --> 02:46:32.749
FACT, LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.

02:46:32.816 --> 02:46:35.285
SO IN THAT SITUATION, OUR LOCAL

02:46:35.352 --> 02:46:37.887
LAW ENFORCEMENTS DO HAVE A ROLE

02:46:37.954 --> 02:46:40.090
IN PROTECTING OUR PEOPLE. AND SO

02:46:40.156 --> 02:46:42.926
THIS BILL AND JUST LIKE THE

02:46:42.992 --> 02:46:45.195
ADMINISTRATION NOW IS BLANKETING

02:46:45.261 --> 02:46:46.963
EVERYBODY AND GOING AFTER PEOPLE

02:46:47.030 --> 02:46:49.032
IN DIFFERENT HOME DEPOTS AND

02:46:49.099 --> 02:46:50.934
THESE THINGS, STEREOTYPING

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.169
PEOPLE IN A SENSE, WE'RE DOING

02:46:53.236 --> 02:46:55.305
THE SAME THING TO OUR LOCAL LAW

02:46:55.372 --> 02:46:56.673
ENFORCEMENT. WHEN THE LOCAL LAW

02:46:56.740 --> 02:46:57.807
ENFORCEMENT ARE GOING TO BE THE

02:46:57.874 --> 02:46:59.809
ONES THAT WE'RE CALLING TO

02:46:59.876 --> 02:47:00.910
PROTECT US, TO ENSURE THAT

02:47:00.977 --> 02:47:02.779
PEOPLE THAT ARE BEING TAKEN ARE

02:47:02.846 --> 02:47:05.582
BEING INVESTIGATED. AND SO I

02:47:05.648 --> 02:47:08.118
THINK THE FEDERAL ASPECT DON'T

02:47:08.184 --> 02:47:09.185
TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU. THERE

02:47:09.252 --> 02:47:11.187
SHOULD BE SOME COMPONENTS ON

02:47:11.254 --> 02:47:12.489
THAT. BUT WHEN WE TAKE THE

02:47:12.555 --> 02:47:14.491
PAINTBRUSH, WE BRING PAINTBRUSH.

02:47:14.557 --> 02:47:16.493
ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE STATE

02:47:16.559 --> 02:47:17.260
OF CALIFORNIA, OUR COUNTY

02:47:17.327 --> 02:47:18.228
SHERIFFS, OUR LOCAL LAW

02:47:18.294 --> 02:47:19.796
ENFORCEMENT, HIGHWAY PATROL, ALL

02:47:19.863 --> 02:47:21.598
OF THOSE WHEN THEY'RE ACTUALLY

02:47:21.664 --> 02:47:23.266
CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE FROM THE

02:47:23.333 --> 02:47:24.834
FEDERAL OFFICERS COMING IN,

02:47:24.901 --> 02:47:25.902
DOING WHAT THEY'RE DOING. AND

02:47:25.969 --> 02:47:27.303
THEN THEY HAVE TO BE CALLED

02:47:27.370 --> 02:47:28.371
BECAUSE SOME THINGS HAPPEN, AND

02:47:28.438 --> 02:47:30.407
NOW THEY'RE OUT THERE TRYING TO

02:47:30.473 --> 02:47:31.908
CONTROL AND BRING PEACE TO THE

02:47:31.975 --> 02:47:33.843
SITUATION. I THINK THERE'S MERIT

02:47:33.910 --> 02:47:35.578
IN BRINGING FORWARD ARGUMENTS

02:47:35.645 --> 02:47:37.347
AGAINST THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

02:47:37.414 --> 02:47:38.882
I'M NOT SO SURE THAT THERE'S

02:47:38.948 --> 02:47:40.083
MERIT AGAINST OUR LOCAL LAW

02:47:40.150 --> 02:47:41.584
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. AND THAT'S

02:47:41.651 --> 02:47:44.487
WHERE I'M HAVING SOME SOME

02:47:44.554 --> 02:47:47.090
DISAGREEMENT ON. AND I VERY MUCH

02:47:47.157 --> 02:47:48.892
RESPECT THAT. AND I AND I

02:47:48.958 --> 02:47:51.728
APPRECIATE IT. I, I GUESS MY, MY

02:47:51.795 --> 02:47:56.833
TAKE ON IT IS I, I IS SHOWING US

02:47:56.900 --> 02:47:59.302
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE BASICALLY

02:47:59.369 --> 02:48:01.070
SECRET POLICE WHERE YOU'RE LIKE

02:48:01.137 --> 02:48:03.306
WEARING ESSENTIALLY A SKI MASK

02:48:03.373 --> 02:48:04.741
OR SOMETHING, APPROACHING A SKI

02:48:04.808 --> 02:48:06.342
MASK AND HOW COMPLETELY

02:48:06.409 --> 02:48:08.845
TERRIFYING THAT IS. I LIKE THIS

02:48:08.912 --> 02:48:11.948
IS NOT ABOUT LUMPING IN OR

02:48:12.015 --> 02:48:13.349
DEMONIZING STATE AND LOCAL LAW

02:48:13.416 --> 02:48:15.552
ENFORCEMENT. THEY'RE BEING PUT

02:48:15.618 --> 02:48:17.387
IN A TERRIBLE POSITION. BUT THIS

02:48:17.454 --> 02:48:19.122
IS ABOUT SAYING WE'VE NOW SEEN

02:48:19.189 --> 02:48:20.957
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE LAW

02:48:21.024 --> 02:48:22.559
ENFORCEMENT DO THAT. WE DON'T

02:48:22.625 --> 02:48:24.594
WANT ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DO

02:48:24.661 --> 02:48:26.429
THAT. AND SO IF WE'RE GOING TO

02:48:26.496 --> 02:48:29.566
SET A STANDARD, LET'S MAKE IT A

02:48:29.632 --> 02:48:30.733
STANDARD FOR ALL LAW

02:48:30.800 --> 02:48:32.635
ENFORCEMENT. I YOU KNOW, I CAN'T

02:48:32.702 --> 02:48:34.637
EVEN IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD BE. I

02:48:34.704 --> 02:48:35.472
WORK VERY CLOSELY AS

02:48:35.538 --> 02:48:36.339
ASSEMBLYMEMBER HANEY WITH THE

02:48:36.406 --> 02:48:37.407
SAN FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT,

02:48:37.474 --> 02:48:38.908
AND I SUPPORT THAT DEPARTMENT. A

02:48:38.975 --> 02:48:41.044
LOT OF HARD WORKING OFFICERS WHO

02:48:41.110 --> 02:48:45.014
DO GREAT WORK. AND THE IDEA AND

02:48:45.081 --> 02:48:48.218
THAT IF ONE WERE TO SHOW UP AND

02:48:48.284 --> 02:48:50.153
YOU SAW A LOCAL POLICE OFFICER

02:48:50.220 --> 02:48:51.554
WEARING A SKI MASK, WE WOULD ALL

02:48:51.621 --> 02:48:52.622
BE HORRIFIED. THEY'RE NOT DOING

02:48:52.689 --> 02:48:54.390
THAT. AND I DON'T WANT THEM EVER

02:48:54.457 --> 02:48:56.326
TO EVEN THINK ABOUT DOING THAT.

02:48:56.392 --> 02:48:58.194
AND WE SHOULD SET THOSE CLEAR

02:48:58.261 --> 02:48:59.429
STANDARDS NOW, AND THEY SHOULD

02:48:59.496 --> 02:49:01.064
APPLY TO EVERYONE, PARTICULARLY

02:49:01.130 --> 02:49:03.066
IN A SITUATION WHERE DONALD

02:49:03.132 --> 02:49:04.868
TRUMP HAS SAID THAT HE WANTS TO

02:49:04.934 --> 02:49:06.603
FORCE STATE AND LOCAL LAW

02:49:06.669 --> 02:49:08.471
ENFORCEMENT TO BECOME ARMS OF

02:49:08.538 --> 02:49:10.573
ICE, THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS. WE'RE

02:49:10.640 --> 02:49:12.141
FIGHTING HIM ON THAT. WHEN HE

02:49:12.208 --> 02:49:13.443
SAYS HE WANTS TO DEFUND

02:49:13.510 --> 02:49:14.944
SANCTUARY CITIES, SANCTUARY

02:49:15.011 --> 02:49:16.279
CITIES, THAT'S WHAT HE'S TALKING

02:49:16.346 --> 02:49:17.747
ABOUT. FORCING LOCAL LAW

02:49:17.814 --> 02:49:18.915
ENFORCEMENT TO BECOME

02:49:18.982 --> 02:49:20.283
IMMIGRATION AGENTS, WHICH THEY

02:49:20.350 --> 02:49:22.151
DON'T WANT TO DO. AND WE DON'T

02:49:22.218 --> 02:49:24.320
WANT THEM TO DO THAT. BUT THAT'S

02:49:24.387 --> 02:49:24.921
WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO FORCE

02:49:24.988 --> 02:49:27.891
THEM TO DO. SENATOR, COULD I

02:49:27.957 --> 02:49:28.925
APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM

02:49:28.992 --> 02:49:30.727
SEVERAL OF THE MEMBERS CONCERNED

02:49:30.793 --> 02:49:32.195
ABOUT OUR STATE AND LOCAL LAW

02:49:32.262 --> 02:49:33.596
ENFORCEMENT. AND I THINK WHAT

02:49:33.663 --> 02:49:34.697
WE'RE SEEING AROUND THE STATE

02:49:34.764 --> 02:49:36.132
AND AROUND THE COUNTRY IS

02:49:36.199 --> 02:49:37.534
BECAUSE OF THE ACTIONS OF ICE.

02:49:37.600 --> 02:49:40.169
ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT IS LOSING

02:49:40.236 --> 02:49:41.538
LEGITIMACY AND TRUST BECAUSE

02:49:41.604 --> 02:49:42.739
INDIVIDUALS IN OUR COMMUNITY

02:49:42.805 --> 02:49:44.107
CANNOT TELL WHO THEY'RE

02:49:44.173 --> 02:49:45.875
INTERACTING WITH. ONE OF THE

02:49:45.942 --> 02:49:47.310
GREAT BENEFITS OF THIS BILL IS

02:49:47.377 --> 02:49:49.445
IT WILL MAKE IT VERY CLEAR TO

02:49:49.512 --> 02:49:50.580
EVERYBODY THAT MASKS ARE NOT

02:49:50.647 --> 02:49:52.749
ALLOWED IN OUR STATE. WHAT WE

02:49:52.815 --> 02:49:53.716
WILL BE DOING IS CODIFYING WHAT

02:49:53.783 --> 02:49:55.585
WE ALREADY DO IN OUR STATE. OUR

02:49:55.652 --> 02:49:56.686
STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:49:56.753 --> 02:49:58.454
DO NOT WEAR MASKS. WE'RE HAPPY

02:49:58.521 --> 02:49:59.689
ABOUT THAT. WE WILL MAKE THAT

02:49:59.756 --> 02:50:01.724
NOW THE OFFICIAL RULE OF OUR

02:50:01.791 --> 02:50:03.560
STATE. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE

02:50:03.626 --> 02:50:04.928
DO THAT, AND THAT WE APPLY THAT

02:50:04.994 --> 02:50:06.396
TO ALL OFFICERS SO THAT WE HAVE

02:50:06.462 --> 02:50:08.798
A SHOT AT AT REINING IN THE

02:50:08.865 --> 02:50:10.733
ACTIVITY THAT WE'RE SEEING FROM

02:50:10.800 --> 02:50:12.101
FEDERAL OFFICERS RIGHT NOW. AND

02:50:12.168 --> 02:50:13.703
YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBERS SO WISELY

02:50:13.770 --> 02:50:15.004
POINT OUT THE CHALLENGE THAT

02:50:15.071 --> 02:50:16.139
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE IN.

02:50:16.205 --> 02:50:18.708
THE LA POLICE CHIEF HAS NOW

02:50:18.775 --> 02:50:20.777
INSTRUCTED IN A POLICY FOR HIS

02:50:20.843 --> 02:50:21.911
DEPARTMENT THAT HIS OFFICERS

02:50:21.978 --> 02:50:24.414
HAVE TO MAKE INQUIRIES OF MASKED

02:50:24.480 --> 02:50:26.182
AGENTS. THEY ARE IN AN

02:50:26.249 --> 02:50:26.983
IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION OF HAVING

02:50:27.050 --> 02:50:28.818
TO QUESTION ANOTHER OFFICER OUT

02:50:28.885 --> 02:50:31.254
IN THE FIELD IN QUITE DANGEROUS

02:50:31.321 --> 02:50:33.156
CIRCUMSTANCES, SOMETIMES BECAUSE

02:50:33.222 --> 02:50:34.290
CROWDS OF PEOPLE ARE GATHERING

02:50:34.357 --> 02:50:35.925
AND DON'T KNOW WHO IS GRABBING

02:50:35.992 --> 02:50:37.493
PEOPLE OUT OF THE CAR WASH OR

02:50:37.560 --> 02:50:39.596
THE PARK. IT IS CREATING CHAOS

02:50:39.662 --> 02:50:40.964
IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT IS

02:50:41.030 --> 02:50:42.298
PUTTING LAW ENFORCEMENT IN VERY

02:50:42.365 --> 02:50:43.833
REAL DANGER. OUR LOCAL LAW

02:50:43.900 --> 02:50:45.668
ENFORCEMENT IN VERY REAL DANGER.

02:50:45.735 --> 02:50:47.637
AND THE HOPE OF THIS LEGISLATION

02:50:47.704 --> 02:50:49.906
IS THAT WE WILL HAVE A CLEAR LAW

02:50:49.973 --> 02:50:51.407
IN OUR STATE THAT WE DO NOT

02:50:51.474 --> 02:50:52.976
MASK. THAT IS CURRENTLY THE

02:50:53.042 --> 02:50:54.444
POLICY OF MOST OF THE AGENCIES

02:50:54.510 --> 02:50:57.080
IN THE STATE. WHAT WE ARE ASKING

02:50:57.146 --> 02:50:57.880
FOR IN THE LEGISLATION IS THAT

02:50:57.947 --> 02:50:59.682
EACH AGENCY HAVE THAT POLICY

02:50:59.749 --> 02:51:01.117
THAT THEIR OFFICERS WILL NOT

02:51:01.184 --> 02:51:02.518
MASK, AND EVERY AGENCY THAT HAS

02:51:02.585 --> 02:51:04.320
THOSE POLICIES, THERE IS NO

02:51:04.387 --> 02:51:05.588
CRIMINAL LIABILITY FOR THEIR

02:51:05.655 --> 02:51:07.523
EMPLOYEES BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND

02:51:07.590 --> 02:51:08.658
THAT THEY ARE DOING A LAW

02:51:08.725 --> 02:51:09.859
ENFORCEMENT JOB. THERE ARE

02:51:09.926 --> 02:51:10.660
SCENARIOS WHERE THEY NEED TO

02:51:10.727 --> 02:51:12.929
WEAR FACE PROTECTIONS OF VARYING

02:51:12.996 --> 02:51:14.364
DEGREES, AND THOSE WILL BE

02:51:14.430 --> 02:51:16.032
ACCOUNTED FOR IN THEIR LOCAL

02:51:16.099 --> 02:51:17.734
POLICIES. BUT IF WE DO NOT HAVE

02:51:17.800 --> 02:51:19.869
A BROAD BILL THAT COVERS ALL OF

02:51:19.936 --> 02:51:22.305
LAW ENFORCEMENT, WE ARE CREATING

02:51:22.372 --> 02:51:23.439
SUSCEPTIBILITY IN OUR APPROACH,

02:51:23.506 --> 02:51:24.907
AND IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE

02:51:24.974 --> 02:51:27.010
HAVE A UNIFORM APPROACH TO THIS

02:51:27.076 --> 02:51:28.811
ISSUE. I THINK WE ALL AGREE WITH

02:51:28.878 --> 02:51:30.213
THAT. I THINK THE SUPPORT THAT

02:51:30.279 --> 02:51:31.714
IS HERE IS BECAUSE WE DON'T

02:51:31.781 --> 02:51:33.650
EXPERIENCE THAT IN OUR STATE, ON

02:51:33.716 --> 02:51:35.151
THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. THANK

02:51:35.218 --> 02:51:35.752
GOODNESS. AND THANK GOODNESS

02:51:35.818 --> 02:51:37.553
THAT WE NEVER WILL IF WE'RE ABLE

02:51:37.620 --> 02:51:39.389
TO PASS THIS. WE DON'T EVEN COME

02:51:39.455 --> 02:51:40.390
NEAR THAT QUESTION, AND

02:51:40.456 --> 02:51:42.058
HOPEFULLY WE HAVE A SHOT AT

02:51:42.125 --> 02:51:42.792
CREATING SOME BUFFERS AROUND

02:51:42.859 --> 02:51:43.593
WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS

02:51:43.660 --> 02:51:45.461
DOING RIGHT NOW, AND WE CAN HELP

02:51:45.528 --> 02:51:47.697
OUR COMMUNITIES REMEMBER THAT

02:51:47.764 --> 02:51:49.432
LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THIS STATE IS

02:51:49.499 --> 02:51:52.835
THERE TO SERVE AND PROTECT THEM.

02:51:52.902 --> 02:51:54.470
IMMIGRANT, NONIMMIGRANT,

02:51:54.537 --> 02:51:57.907
EVERYONE ALIKE. THANK YOU VERY

02:51:57.974 --> 02:52:00.476
MUCH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS,

02:52:00.543 --> 02:52:02.078
VICE CHAIR ALANIS, THE FLOOR IS

02:52:02.145 --> 02:52:04.480
YOURS. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. I

02:52:04.547 --> 02:52:06.382
WAS GOING TO GO INTO SOMETHING,

02:52:06.449 --> 02:52:08.851
BUT DO YOU GUYS WANT TO ADDRESS

02:52:08.918 --> 02:52:10.219
WHAT WAS JUST SAID? AS FAR AS

02:52:10.286 --> 02:52:12.422
THE. YEAH, LOOK, ALL I WOULD

02:52:12.488 --> 02:52:15.258
LIKE TO SAY IS THAT WE ARE BEING

02:52:15.324 --> 02:52:17.894
LUMPED IN IN THE SENSE THAT

02:52:17.960 --> 02:52:19.962
THEY'RE MAKING THIS A CRIME.

02:52:20.029 --> 02:52:22.165
WHEN WE DEALT WITH OTHER VERY

02:52:22.231 --> 02:52:24.000
SERIOUS ISSUES LIKE USE OF FORCE

02:52:24.067 --> 02:52:25.735
BY OFFICERS BECAUSE OF INCIDENTS

02:52:25.802 --> 02:52:28.604
THAT OCCURRED BACK EAST, ALL THE

02:52:28.671 --> 02:52:30.707
THINGS THAT SURROUNDED THAT

02:52:30.773 --> 02:52:32.275
DE-ESCALATION OF FORCE, ALL OF

02:52:32.341 --> 02:52:33.710
THAT, ALL OF THAT, IN THE END,

02:52:33.776 --> 02:52:36.913
WAS CREATED BY MANDATING

02:52:36.979 --> 02:52:39.382
STATEWIDE STANDARDS ON POLICY

02:52:39.449 --> 02:52:41.684
THAT ALL AGENCIES SHALL HAVE

02:52:41.751 --> 02:52:43.786
THESE POLICIES IN PLACE OR

02:52:43.853 --> 02:52:45.822
GREATER TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE.

02:52:45.888 --> 02:52:48.157
SO IN THE FUTURE, THEY WON'T BE

02:52:48.224 --> 02:52:49.525
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WON'T WEAR

02:52:49.592 --> 02:52:51.327
A MASK BECAUSE THEY CAN'T. IT

02:52:51.394 --> 02:52:52.628
WILL BE WRONG TO DO THAT. IT'LL

02:52:52.695 --> 02:52:54.263
BE ILLEGAL, IT'LL BE AGAINST

02:52:54.330 --> 02:52:55.465
POLICY, AND THOSE OFFICERS WILL

02:52:55.531 --> 02:52:57.800
BE FIRED AND LIKELY BE LOSE

02:52:57.867 --> 02:52:59.368
THEIR LICENSE TO BE A PEACE

02:52:59.435 --> 02:53:00.670
OFFICER IN CALIFORNIA UNDER SB

02:53:00.737 --> 02:53:02.672
TWO. THAT'S HOW WE DEALT WITH

02:53:02.739 --> 02:53:03.973
OTHER SERIOUS ISSUES. LIKE WE'RE

02:53:04.040 --> 02:53:05.675
IN AN UNPRECEDENTED AREA. I GET

02:53:05.742 --> 02:53:08.845
THIS, BUT TO PUT US IN WITH

02:53:08.911 --> 02:53:10.046
EVERYTHING THAT'S BEING

02:53:10.113 --> 02:53:11.881
DESCRIBED FROM THE FEDERAL

02:53:11.948 --> 02:53:13.382
AGENTS IS NOT THE WAY TO DO IT.

02:53:13.449 --> 02:53:16.452
BY MAKING IT A CRIME AGAINST AN

02:53:16.519 --> 02:53:19.355
OFFICER, IT MANDATE IN THIS BILL

02:53:19.422 --> 02:53:21.591
THAT IT APPLIES TO ALL FEDERAL

02:53:21.657 --> 02:53:22.725
AGENTS AND GO AFTER THEM, AND

02:53:22.792 --> 02:53:24.460
THEN ON ANYTHING RELATED TO

02:53:24.527 --> 02:53:25.895
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT MANDATE,

02:53:25.962 --> 02:53:28.297
MINIMUM STANDARDS. THIS ISN'T

02:53:28.364 --> 02:53:30.199
SAYING THIS ISN'T A STANDARD.

02:53:30.266 --> 02:53:33.436
THIS IS A NEW CRIME MANDATE

02:53:33.503 --> 02:53:34.871
STANDARDS. WE WILL WORK AND

02:53:34.937 --> 02:53:36.272
MANDATE STANDARDS AND MAKE THEM

02:53:36.339 --> 02:53:38.074
HIGH AND MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T

02:53:38.141 --> 02:53:39.909
EVER GO DOWN THIS ROAD AND WE

02:53:39.976 --> 02:53:42.178
WILL FULLY ENGAGE ON THAT AND

02:53:42.245 --> 02:53:44.013
SUPPORT IT. SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

02:53:44.080 --> 02:53:47.884
TALKING ABOUT. THANK YOU FOR

02:53:47.950 --> 02:53:50.419
RESPONDING TO THAT. SO FOR THE

02:53:50.486 --> 02:53:52.188
FOR CHRISTINE, REAL QUICK, I

02:53:52.255 --> 02:53:53.623
KNOW YOU'RE A PROUD SPONSOR AND

02:53:53.689 --> 02:53:54.690
YOU TALKED ABOUT THIS IS GOING

02:53:54.757 --> 02:53:56.025
TO PROTECT LAW ENFORCEMENT. CAN

02:53:56.092 --> 02:53:57.393
YOU ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT MORE

02:53:57.460 --> 02:53:59.729
ON HOW IT'S GOING TO PROTECT LAW

02:53:59.796 --> 02:54:00.463
ENFORCEMENT. YES. THANK YOU.

02:54:00.530 --> 02:54:02.532
MEMBER I THINK LOS ANGELES IS A

02:54:02.598 --> 02:54:04.367
GREAT EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW WHERE

02:54:04.433 --> 02:54:05.535
OFFICERS ARE LOCAL LAW

02:54:05.601 --> 02:54:07.970
ENFORCEMENT ARE BEING CALLED OUT

02:54:08.037 --> 02:54:12.008
FOR REPORTED KIDNAPINGS FOR

02:54:12.074 --> 02:54:13.276
CHAOTIC SITUATIONS IN THE

02:54:13.342 --> 02:54:14.577
COMMUNITY. WHEN THERE'S A VAN

02:54:14.644 --> 02:54:16.412
THAT PULLS UP WITHOUT A LICENSE

02:54:16.479 --> 02:54:17.413
PLATE, WITHOUT ANY MARKING ON

02:54:17.480 --> 02:54:20.616
THE VAN AND FULLY DISGUISED, WE

02:54:20.683 --> 02:54:21.784
BELIEVE OUR FEDERAL OFFICERS,

02:54:21.851 --> 02:54:23.820
BUT EVERYONE IN THE MOMENT HAS

02:54:23.886 --> 02:54:25.655
LITTLE CERTAINTY. THAT IS

02:54:25.721 --> 02:54:27.056
CREATING A VERY CHALLENGING

02:54:27.123 --> 02:54:28.191
SITUATION FOR LOCAL LAW

02:54:28.257 --> 02:54:29.592
ENFORCEMENT. THEY ARE CALLED OUT

02:54:29.659 --> 02:54:31.427
TO RESPOND TO A KIDNAPING AND

02:54:31.494 --> 02:54:33.462
THEN ENCOUNTER WHAT THEY ARE

02:54:33.529 --> 02:54:34.931
UNSURE IF THEY ARE FEDERAL

02:54:34.997 --> 02:54:37.233
OFFICERS, IF THEY ARE IMPOSTERS.

02:54:37.300 --> 02:54:38.701
AND AS I INDICATED, LOS ANGELES

02:54:38.768 --> 02:54:40.770
POLICE CHIEF NOW HAS ASKED ALL

02:54:40.837 --> 02:54:43.372
OF HIS SWORN OFFICERS TO

02:54:43.439 --> 02:54:45.575
INQUIRE. AND I KNOW MANY OF YOU

02:54:45.641 --> 02:54:47.510
HAVE BEEN IN LAW ENFORCEMENT.

02:54:47.577 --> 02:54:48.678
YOU CAN IMAGINE THE JUST THE

02:54:48.744 --> 02:54:49.779
UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATION OF

02:54:49.846 --> 02:54:51.714
SHOWING UP TO A SCENE WHERE YOU

02:54:51.781 --> 02:54:53.749
THINK, MAYBE I'M ENCOUNTERING A

02:54:53.816 --> 02:54:54.383
COLLEAGUE, MAYBE I'M NOT, AND I

02:54:54.450 --> 02:54:56.185
NOW HAVE TO ENGAGE IN AN

02:54:56.252 --> 02:54:58.387
IDENTIFICATION PROCESS OF A

02:54:58.454 --> 02:54:59.856
FEDERAL AGENT IN THE MIDDLE OF

02:54:59.922 --> 02:55:01.257
AN ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY. IT IS

02:55:01.324 --> 02:55:02.992
AN INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS

02:55:03.059 --> 02:55:04.861
SITUATION. WE'VE NOT YET SEEN A

02:55:04.927 --> 02:55:08.097
SITUATION WITH WEAPONS IN THE

02:55:08.164 --> 02:55:09.899
HANDS OF ANYBODY, BUT YOU COULD

02:55:09.966 --> 02:55:11.100
IMAGINE SO MANY SCENARIOS WHERE

02:55:11.167 --> 02:55:12.501
IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO

02:55:12.568 --> 02:55:13.936
INQUIRE IN THE MOMENT WHO YOU'RE

02:55:14.003 --> 02:55:17.106
INTERACTING WITH, AND A REALLY

02:55:17.173 --> 02:55:18.241
PRECARIOUS LIFE AND DEATH

02:55:18.307 --> 02:55:19.242
SITUATION, FRANKLY, FOR THOSE

02:55:19.308 --> 02:55:20.476
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS FROM

02:55:20.543 --> 02:55:21.878
OUR COMMUNITY THAT ARE ASKED TO

02:55:21.944 --> 02:55:23.279
RESPOND. SO THE HOPE IS WITH

02:55:23.346 --> 02:55:25.381
THIS BILL, WE WILL MAKE IT CLEAR

02:55:25.448 --> 02:55:27.683
THAT NOBODY CAN WEAR A MASK, AND

02:55:27.750 --> 02:55:28.551
THEN IT WILL BE VERY CLEAR WHEN

02:55:28.618 --> 02:55:30.186
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IS CALLED

02:55:30.253 --> 02:55:31.520
TO RESPOND TO A CHAOTIC

02:55:31.587 --> 02:55:32.955
SITUATION AT A CAR WASH OR IN

02:55:33.022 --> 02:55:34.257
MACARTHUR PARK, THEY WILL KNOW

02:55:34.323 --> 02:55:34.790
THAT THEY'RE ENCOUNTERING

02:55:34.857 --> 02:55:37.026
FEDERAL OFFICERS AND THEY WILL

02:55:37.093 --> 02:55:38.094
UNDERSTAND THEIR OWN PROTOCOLS,

02:55:38.160 --> 02:55:40.663
HOW TO ENGAGE WITH THEM VERSUS

02:55:40.730 --> 02:55:43.232
SOMEBODY THAT'S IMPERSONATING.

02:55:43.299 --> 02:55:45.134
THANK YOU. LET ME REMIND

02:55:45.201 --> 02:55:46.435
EVERYBODY THAT IT WASN'T TOO

02:55:46.502 --> 02:55:47.536
LONG AGO THAT WE WERE REQUIRED

02:55:47.603 --> 02:55:49.438
TO WEAR A MASK IN LAW

02:55:49.505 --> 02:55:50.907
ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE OF COVID, SO

02:55:50.973 --> 02:55:52.742
THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS

02:55:52.808 --> 02:55:53.509
NOT COME UP. AND THAT WAS

02:55:53.576 --> 02:55:54.644
SOMETHING THAT WAS PUSHED ON LAW

02:55:54.710 --> 02:55:55.845
ENFORCEMENT, INCLUDING MYSELF.

02:55:55.912 --> 02:55:57.680
I'M I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF THIS

02:55:57.747 --> 02:55:59.882
BILL, SENATOR. I'M SORRY. I KNOW

02:55:59.949 --> 02:56:01.050
MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO

02:56:01.117 --> 02:56:03.286
MADE A LOT OF GOOD POINTS AS FAR

02:56:03.352 --> 02:56:05.421
AS WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO TRUST

02:56:05.488 --> 02:56:06.088
LAW ENFORCEMENT. LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:56:06.155 --> 02:56:07.657
HAS DONE A GREAT JOB IN BUILDING

02:56:07.723 --> 02:56:09.258
COMMUNITY TRUST AND WEARING

02:56:09.325 --> 02:56:10.726
THEIR BADGES, THEIR

02:56:10.793 --> 02:56:11.694
IDENTIFICATIONS, AS AS HE

02:56:11.761 --> 02:56:13.829
MENTIONED, AS IS IN OUR COMMON

02:56:13.896 --> 02:56:18.167
PRACTICES THAT GO ON RIGHT NOW.

02:56:18.234 --> 02:56:19.468
IT IS ALSO OUR RESPONSIBILITY,

02:56:19.535 --> 02:56:21.470
AS WAS BROUGHT UP, TO MAKE SURE

02:56:21.537 --> 02:56:22.605
THAT WE PROTECT CALIFORNIANS.

02:56:22.672 --> 02:56:23.539
HOWEVER, WE DO NOT HAVE THE

02:56:23.606 --> 02:56:24.740
AUTHORITY OVER THE FEDERAL

02:56:24.807 --> 02:56:25.708
GOVERNMENT, WHICH IS WHO THIS

02:56:25.775 --> 02:56:28.411
BILL IS REALLY GOING AFTER. I

02:56:28.477 --> 02:56:30.179
WAS GOING TO BRING UP AN

02:56:30.246 --> 02:56:31.614
INCIDENT AS FAR AS WHEN I USED

02:56:31.681 --> 02:56:34.050
TO BE ON SWAT, AND WE WERE GOING

02:56:34.116 --> 02:56:35.151
AFTER THE CARTELS, WE HAD TO

02:56:35.217 --> 02:56:36.018
STRIP EVERYTHING THAT IDENTIFIED

02:56:36.085 --> 02:56:38.487
US TO PROTECT MY FAMILY, TO

02:56:38.554 --> 02:56:40.523
PROTECT MYSELF, MY DEPARTMENT.

02:56:40.589 --> 02:56:41.691
AND I SEE THERE'S SOME

02:56:41.757 --> 02:56:42.725
EXEMPTIONS LIKE THAT FOR SWAT,

02:56:42.792 --> 02:56:44.894
BUT I SEE THE EXEMPTION IS

02:56:44.961 --> 02:56:47.063
ACTUALLY FOR COVERING AND THEIR

02:56:47.129 --> 02:56:48.564
FACE TO PROTECT THEM FROM ANY

02:56:48.631 --> 02:56:50.299
KIND OF THINGS THAT GO ON IN

02:56:50.366 --> 02:56:52.101
THERE. IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING

02:56:52.168 --> 02:56:52.768
ABOUT PROTECTING THEIR FAMILIES.

02:56:52.835 --> 02:56:54.971
IT'S JUST THEIR FACE ON THERE. I

02:56:55.037 --> 02:56:57.039
ALSO USED TO RUN ONE OF OUR

02:56:57.106 --> 02:56:59.075
MOBILE FIELD FORCE TEAMS THAT GO

02:56:59.141 --> 02:57:01.077
IN FOR RIOTS. THEY WERE GAS

02:57:01.143 --> 02:57:03.546
MASKS. SO ARE THEY NOT ALLOWED

02:57:03.612 --> 02:57:05.815
TO WEAR THEIR GAS MASKS BECAUSE

02:57:05.881 --> 02:57:06.449
THAT COVERS THEM? I SEE IT HAS

02:57:06.515 --> 02:57:07.950
TO BE A TRANSPARENT SHIELD AND

02:57:08.017 --> 02:57:09.752
THEY MAY WEAR THOSE ALSO, BUT

02:57:09.819 --> 02:57:11.887
WHEN GAS IS USED, I EXPECT THEM

02:57:11.954 --> 02:57:13.823
TO BE WEARING THEIR GAS MASKS.

02:57:13.889 --> 02:57:14.757
SO THAT COULD BE AN ISSUE IN

02:57:14.824 --> 02:57:17.393
ITSELF. I KNOW THIS DOESN'T FEEL

02:57:17.460 --> 02:57:18.928
LIKE WE'RE ATTACKING LAW

02:57:18.995 --> 02:57:19.929
ENFORCEMENT, BUT UNINTENTIONALLY

02:57:19.996 --> 02:57:22.231
IT IS ATTACKING LAW ENFORCEMENT.

02:57:22.298 --> 02:57:25.601
I UNDERSTAND THAT THE ROOT OF

02:57:25.668 --> 02:57:27.303
THIS BILL IS TO GO AFTER ICE FOR

02:57:27.370 --> 02:57:28.704
ALL THE RAIDS AND EVERYTHING

02:57:28.771 --> 02:57:30.206
THAT ARE GOING ON, AND BELIEVE

02:57:30.272 --> 02:57:32.308
ME, I'M GETTING PHONE CALLS FROM

02:57:32.375 --> 02:57:33.409
CHIEFS, FROM SHERIFFS, AND FROM

02:57:33.476 --> 02:57:34.477
OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS

02:57:34.543 --> 02:57:36.645
WHO ARE NOT HAPPY WITH THAT, BUT

02:57:36.712 --> 02:57:38.347
THEY CARE ABOUT THEIR COMMUNITY

02:57:38.414 --> 02:57:40.383
AND WHEN THEY ARE WEARING MASKS,

02:57:40.449 --> 02:57:41.484
WHEN I'VE BEEN ON SEARCH

02:57:41.550 --> 02:57:43.486
WARRANTS AND SUCH, AND I KNOW

02:57:43.552 --> 02:57:44.920
IT'S COVERED HERE FOR UNDERCOVER

02:57:44.987 --> 02:57:46.389
WORK, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE

02:57:46.455 --> 02:57:47.423
PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF THE

02:57:47.490 --> 02:57:49.625
CASE THAT'S GOING ON. WE WANT TO

02:57:49.692 --> 02:57:50.559
MAKE SURE THAT WE PROTECT THE

02:57:50.626 --> 02:57:51.927
IDENTITY OF THAT UNDERCOVER,

02:57:51.994 --> 02:57:54.196
UNDERCOVER OFFICER THAT'S

02:57:54.263 --> 02:57:56.032
WORKING. AND SO THINGS. AND SO

02:57:56.098 --> 02:57:57.433
THERE'S ALREADY THINGS IN PLACE

02:57:57.500 --> 02:57:58.601
FOR THAT. I ALSO SEE THAT

02:57:58.667 --> 02:57:59.668
THERE'S AN EXEMPTION FOR SMOKE,

02:57:59.735 --> 02:58:02.805
BUT IT HAS TO DO. AND I KNOW IT

02:58:02.872 --> 02:58:03.439
WAS ALREADY BROUGHT UP, HAS TO

02:58:03.506 --> 02:58:05.541
DO WITH FIRE AS FAR AS LIKE A

02:58:05.608 --> 02:58:06.909
FOREST FIRE. WELL, I'VE GONE

02:58:06.976 --> 02:58:08.377
INTO BUILDINGS WHERE THE HOUSE

02:58:08.444 --> 02:58:10.479
IS ON FIRE AND I WANT TO COVER

02:58:10.546 --> 02:58:11.580
MY FACE. SO AM I NOW COMMITTING

02:58:11.647 --> 02:58:13.549
A MISDEMEANOR BY DOING THAT? BY

02:58:13.616 --> 02:58:14.917
GOING INTO PROTECT AND SAVE

02:58:14.984 --> 02:58:17.686
PEOPLE, WHICH I HAVE DONE.

02:58:17.753 --> 02:58:18.721
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS IN THIS

02:58:18.788 --> 02:58:21.357
BILL THAT NEED A LOT OF WORK ON,

02:58:21.424 --> 02:58:22.391
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE

02:58:22.458 --> 02:58:24.727
TRYING TO PUT IT THROUGH FAST

02:58:24.794 --> 02:58:25.961
AND QUICK, AND IT'S KIND OF A

02:58:26.028 --> 02:58:28.531
KNEE JERK. BILL TO GO AFTER THE

02:58:28.597 --> 02:58:29.331
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BUT I THINK

02:58:29.398 --> 02:58:30.699
THERE ARE BETTER WAYS TO DO

02:58:30.766 --> 02:58:32.868
THAT. AND I THINK WORKING WITH

02:58:32.935 --> 02:58:33.702
PORAC, THE SHERIFF'S, THE

02:58:33.769 --> 02:58:36.138
CHIEFS, THE PEACE OFFICERS

02:58:36.205 --> 02:58:36.906
ASSOCIATION, I THINK IS GOING TO

02:58:36.972 --> 02:58:39.408
BE OUR BEST WAY TO DO THAT. AND

02:58:39.475 --> 02:58:40.709
I THINK THERE'S OTHER THINGS

02:58:40.776 --> 02:58:41.811
THAT COULD BE DONE AS FAR AS

02:58:41.877 --> 02:58:44.680
LIKE WHEN WE DO A SWAT

02:58:44.747 --> 02:58:46.015
OPERATION, WE MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:58:46.082 --> 02:58:46.682
CALL IN ON A HOTLINE NUMBER TO

02:58:46.749 --> 02:58:48.617
REPORT WHERE WE'RE GOING. SO

02:58:48.684 --> 02:58:49.618
THAT WAY, IN CASE THERE'S

02:58:49.685 --> 02:58:50.419
ANOTHER AGENCY GOING IN TO DO

02:58:50.486 --> 02:58:52.621
THE SAME THING THAT WE DON'T

02:58:52.688 --> 02:58:54.090
ACCIDENTALLY HAVE FRIENDLY FIRE

02:58:54.156 --> 02:58:55.858
SITUATION. THERE COULD BE A BILL

02:58:55.925 --> 02:58:57.293
MAYBE THAT GOES ON WITH THAT. SO

02:58:57.359 --> 02:58:58.794
THAT WAY LAW ENFORCEMENT IS

02:58:58.861 --> 02:58:59.762
AWARE OKAY. YEAH. THERE'S

02:58:59.829 --> 02:59:00.663
SOMETHING GOING ON THERE. WE

02:59:00.729 --> 02:59:02.731
KNOW IT'S NOT A KIDNAPING AS AS

02:59:02.798 --> 02:59:04.567
BROUGHT UP. I THINK THERE'S SO

02:59:04.633 --> 02:59:06.335
MANY OTHER THINGS WE COULD DO. I

02:59:06.402 --> 02:59:09.105
THINK TURNING OUR TRUSTED LAW

02:59:09.171 --> 02:59:11.640
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES INTO

02:59:11.707 --> 02:59:13.075
CRIMINALS JUST FOR WEARING A

02:59:13.142 --> 02:59:15.344
MASK OR COVERING THEMSELVES TO

02:59:15.411 --> 02:59:17.146
PROTECT THEIR FAMILIES AND

02:59:17.213 --> 02:59:19.215
THEMSELVES IS NOT THE ANSWER.

02:59:19.281 --> 02:59:20.916
AND SO I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING

02:59:20.983 --> 02:59:22.418
THE SENATOR, I APOLOGIZE. THANK

02:59:22.485 --> 02:59:24.353
YOU VERY MUCH, MR. VICE CHAIR.

02:59:24.420 --> 02:59:26.122
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS?

02:59:26.188 --> 02:59:30.025
ALL RIGHT. I'D LIKE TO WEIGH IN.

02:59:30.092 --> 02:59:31.260
OKAY. DO YOU MIND IF I ASK A

02:59:31.327 --> 02:59:32.461
QUESTION FIRST, MR. GONZALEZ?

02:59:32.528 --> 02:59:34.296
OKAY. THANK YOU. I'M NOT GOING

02:59:34.363 --> 02:59:36.132
TO GIVE MY RECOMMENDATION YET,

02:59:36.198 --> 02:59:36.932
BUT, SENATOR, I DID WANT TO

02:59:36.999 --> 02:59:39.401
DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION TO SECTION

02:59:39.468 --> 02:59:41.437
ONE OF THE PROPOSED BILL. I. YOU

02:59:41.504 --> 02:59:43.672
KNOW, THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

02:59:43.739 --> 02:59:44.507
SUGGESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE BILL

02:59:44.573 --> 02:59:46.208
DOES. DO. I WANT TO BE

02:59:46.275 --> 02:59:47.643
INCREDIBLY CLEAR. IF AN OFFICER

02:59:47.710 --> 02:59:49.411
NEEDED A MEDICAL GRADE MASK OR A

02:59:49.478 --> 02:59:50.746
SURGICAL OR N95 RESPIRATOR

02:59:50.813 --> 02:59:51.914
DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE

02:59:51.981 --> 02:59:53.149
TRANSMISSION OF AIRBORNE

02:59:53.215 --> 02:59:54.216
DISEASES, SUCH AS IN THE

02:59:54.283 --> 02:59:56.118
INCIDENT OF INSTANCE OF COVID,

02:59:56.185 --> 02:59:57.620
THAT WOULD BE AN EXEMPTION UNDER

02:59:57.686 --> 03:00:00.256
THE BILL, CORRECT? YES, YES. AND

03:00:00.322 --> 03:00:01.924
TO THE VICE CHAIRS POINT A MASK

03:00:01.991 --> 03:00:03.125
DESIGNED TO PROTECT AGAINST

03:00:03.192 --> 03:00:04.426
EXPOSURE TO SMOKE DURING A STATE

03:00:04.493 --> 03:00:05.561
OF EMERGENCY RELATED TO

03:00:05.628 --> 03:00:06.428
WILDFIRE. THAT WOULD BE AN

03:00:06.495 --> 03:00:08.230
EXEMPTION, CORRECT? YES.

03:00:08.297 --> 03:00:09.331
PROTECTIVE GEAR USED BY SWAT.

03:00:09.398 --> 03:00:10.766
THAT'S SPECIAL WEAPONS AND

03:00:10.833 --> 03:00:12.501
TACTICS. TEAM OFFICERS NECESSARY

03:00:12.568 --> 03:00:14.503
TO PROTECT THEIR FACES FROM HARM

03:00:14.570 --> 03:00:15.938
WHILE THEY PERFORM THEIR SWAT

03:00:16.005 --> 03:00:16.539
RESPONSIBILITIES. THAT'S AN

03:00:16.605 --> 03:00:17.873
EXEMPTION, CORRECT? YES. AND I

03:00:17.940 --> 03:00:19.408
DON'T KNOW ABOUT SAN FRANCISCO,

03:00:19.475 --> 03:00:22.011
BUT IN LOS ANGELES, I SEE SWAT

03:00:22.077 --> 03:00:22.611
OFFICERS WEAR THE PROTECTIVE

03:00:22.678 --> 03:00:24.046
SHIELD. IT COVERS THEIR FACE

03:00:24.113 --> 03:00:25.447
REGULARLY IN THE COURSE OF THOSE

03:00:25.514 --> 03:00:27.249
DUTIES. THAT WHAT YOU'VE SEEN IN

03:00:27.316 --> 03:00:28.384
SAN FRANCISCO, TOO? YES. IN

03:00:28.450 --> 03:00:29.518
ADDITION, THE AMENDMENTS

03:00:29.585 --> 03:00:30.586
PROPOSED BY THE COMMITTEE, WHICH

03:00:30.653 --> 03:00:33.422
YOU HAVE AGREED TO ALSO EXEMPT

03:00:33.489 --> 03:00:34.056
UNDERCOVER OPERATIONS, CORRECT?

03:00:34.123 --> 03:00:37.593
CORRECT. OKAY. MR. GONZALEZ,

03:00:37.660 --> 03:00:40.362
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADD? CAN

03:00:40.429 --> 03:00:42.198
YOU WHAT WERE THE FIRST COUPLE

03:00:42.264 --> 03:00:44.233
OF PIECES TO THAT THAT YOU WERE

03:00:44.300 --> 03:00:45.334
ASKING? YOU WERE YOU TALKED

03:00:45.401 --> 03:00:46.202
ABOUT UNDERCOVER, YOU TALKED

03:00:46.268 --> 03:00:47.770
ABOUT SWAT AND YOU TALKED ABOUT

03:00:47.836 --> 03:00:48.704
I COULDN'T FIND IT. MEDICAL AND

03:00:48.771 --> 03:00:50.306
SMOKE. SMOKE AND MEDICAL SMOKE

03:00:50.372 --> 03:00:51.607
AND MEDICAL. OKAY, LOOK, THE

03:00:51.674 --> 03:00:54.710
ONLY DISTINCTION IS THAT BANK

03:00:54.777 --> 03:00:56.779
ROBBERS GO INTO A BANK WEARING A

03:00:56.845 --> 03:00:58.914
SKI MASK TO HIDE THEIR IDENTITY.

03:00:58.981 --> 03:01:00.816
LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOULD NOT DO

03:01:00.883 --> 03:01:03.686
THE SAME. AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

03:01:03.752 --> 03:01:05.788
SITUATIONS OF UNDERCOVER SWAT,

03:01:05.854 --> 03:01:07.289
ALL OF THESE PIECES THAT ARE

03:01:07.356 --> 03:01:09.458
AMENDMENTS TO IT, THOSE ARE

03:01:09.525 --> 03:01:11.460
RESPONSES TO EMERGENCIES OR

03:01:11.527 --> 03:01:12.695
UNDERCOVER COPS WHO ARE TRYING

03:01:12.761 --> 03:01:15.531
TO TAKE OVER A SITUATION. MASKED

03:01:15.598 --> 03:01:16.966
INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT BEING CALLED

03:01:17.032 --> 03:01:18.867
UPON TO COME AND TAKE A PERSON

03:01:18.934 --> 03:01:20.936
OUT OF THEIR CAR, OUT OF A

03:01:21.003 --> 03:01:22.471
GRADUATION, OUT OF A CHURCH. SO

03:01:22.538 --> 03:01:23.572
THE DISTINCTION I WANT TO MAKE,

03:01:23.639 --> 03:01:24.640
AND BECAUSE IT'S BEEN LOS

03:01:24.707 --> 03:01:26.308
ANGELES THAT HAS BEEN MENTIONED,

03:01:26.375 --> 03:01:27.610
MASKED INDIVIDUALS ARE SHOWING

03:01:27.676 --> 03:01:29.945
UP UNANNOUNCED TO KIDNAP

03:01:30.012 --> 03:01:31.447
INDIVIDUALS. THEY ARE NOT

03:01:31.513 --> 03:01:33.449
RESPONDING TO AN EMERGENCY OR A

03:01:33.515 --> 03:01:35.317
FIRE, OR TO A SWAT OPERATION OR

03:01:35.384 --> 03:01:38.520
TO A PROTEST. THEY ARE GOING TO

03:01:38.587 --> 03:01:40.389
INNOCENT PEOPLE'S HOMES, PLACES

03:01:40.456 --> 03:01:43.626
OF WORK AND WORSHIP, MASKED TO

03:01:43.692 --> 03:01:45.761
KIDNAP WITH AN AGENDA. THESE ARE

03:01:45.828 --> 03:01:47.930
BOUNTY HUNTERS. AND THAT'S THE

03:01:47.997 --> 03:01:48.998
DISTINCTION. WHEN LAW

03:01:49.064 --> 03:01:49.798
ENFORCEMENT IS SHOWING UP

03:01:49.865 --> 03:01:52.134
WEARING A MASK, IT'S BECAUSE OF

03:01:52.201 --> 03:01:53.702
THE SITUATION AT HAND TO PROTECT

03:01:53.769 --> 03:01:55.904
AND SEAL THEMSELVES FROM GOING

03:01:55.971 --> 03:01:58.440
INTO THAT FIRE OR INTO THAT

03:01:58.507 --> 03:01:59.742
SITUATION. THE DISTINCTION IS

03:01:59.808 --> 03:02:01.577
THAT MASKED INDIVIDUALS ARE

03:02:01.644 --> 03:02:04.813
SHOWING UP WITHOUT BEING CALLED

03:02:04.880 --> 03:02:06.882
TO CAUSE HARM AND CHAOS ON

03:02:06.949 --> 03:02:08.384
INNOCENT PEOPLE. THERE'S A

03:02:08.450 --> 03:02:10.419
DIFFERENCE THERE. THANK YOU VERY

03:02:10.486 --> 03:02:12.388
MUCH. WE'LL NEXT GO TO OUR VICE

03:02:12.454 --> 03:02:13.922
CHAIR, WHO HAD A POINT HE FORGOT

03:02:13.989 --> 03:02:15.791
TO MENTION. MR. CHAIR, THANK YOU

03:02:15.858 --> 03:02:17.826
FOR THAT. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE

03:02:17.893 --> 03:02:19.261
A POINT ON THE ME TOO'S. NOT

03:02:19.328 --> 03:02:21.163
ONCE DID I SEE A FEDERAL AGENCY

03:02:21.230 --> 03:02:23.632
COME UP TO SAY THAT THEY WERE A

03:02:23.699 --> 03:02:24.633
SUPPORTER OPPOSED BECAUSE THIS

03:02:24.700 --> 03:02:25.834
DOES NOT APPLY TO THEM AND THEY

03:02:25.901 --> 03:02:28.904
DO NOT CARE. THANK YOU. ALL

03:02:28.971 --> 03:02:30.439
RIGHT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR

03:02:30.506 --> 03:02:31.640
COMMENTS? I WILL NOTE THAT WE

03:02:31.707 --> 03:02:33.208
HAVE A MOTION BY MR. GONZALEZ.

03:02:33.275 --> 03:02:36.145
IS THERE A SECOND? I WILL SECOND

03:02:36.211 --> 03:02:39.148
SEN WIENER. YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK

03:02:39.214 --> 03:02:40.783
YOU VERY MUCH, MR. CHAIR AND

03:02:40.849 --> 03:02:42.551
COLLEAGUES. THANK YOU FOR THE

03:02:42.618 --> 03:02:45.821
THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATION. YOU

03:02:45.888 --> 03:02:49.058
KNOW, I, I DO WANT TO SAY THAT

03:02:49.124 --> 03:02:50.659
FEDERAL AGENTS ARE SUBJECT TO

03:02:50.726 --> 03:02:53.362
QUITE A FEW CALIFORNIA STATE

03:02:53.429 --> 03:02:55.831
LAWS, AND SO THEY MAY NOT HAVE

03:02:55.898 --> 03:02:57.299
BEEN HERE TODAY. THEY THE

03:02:57.366 --> 03:03:00.169
ARROGANCE OF THIS ADMINISTRATION

03:03:00.235 --> 03:03:02.705
MAKES THAT NOT SURPRISING. AND

03:03:02.771 --> 03:03:05.741
SO, YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT AT ALL

03:03:05.808 --> 03:03:07.209
SURPRISING THAT THEY WOULD THAT

03:03:07.276 --> 03:03:09.144
THEY WOULD BLOW THIS UP OFF AND

03:03:09.211 --> 03:03:11.747
NOT ENGAGE. BUT THEY THERE ARE

03:03:11.814 --> 03:03:13.515
VARIOUS STATE LAWS THAT FEDERAL

03:03:13.582 --> 03:03:14.917
EMPLOYEES, FEDERAL AGENTS CAN

03:03:14.983 --> 03:03:17.219
VIOLATE AND BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE

03:03:17.286 --> 03:03:19.021
FOR UNDER STATE LAW. WEARING A

03:03:19.088 --> 03:03:20.856
FEDERAL BADGE DOES NOT MAKE YOU

03:03:20.923 --> 03:03:22.891
A GOD. DESPITE WHAT THIS

03:03:22.958 --> 03:03:24.226
ADMINISTRATION MAY THINK OF

03:03:24.293 --> 03:03:30.165
ITSELF. SO YOU KNOW. AND I ALSO

03:03:30.232 --> 03:03:32.334
JUST WANT TO POINT OUT ASSEMBLY

03:03:32.401 --> 03:03:34.136
MEMBER, MR. VICE CHAIR, OR

03:03:34.203 --> 03:03:35.938
EXCUSE ME, SENATOR LACKEY, IN

03:03:36.004 --> 03:03:37.639
TERMS OF COMMUNICATION WITH ICE,

03:03:37.706 --> 03:03:40.609
WE HAVE NOT. I DO KNOW THAT

03:03:40.676 --> 03:03:43.112
NUMEROUS MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IN

03:03:43.178 --> 03:03:44.546
CALIFORNIA HAVE TRIED TO ENGAGE

03:03:44.613 --> 03:03:46.181
WITH ICE ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON,

03:03:46.248 --> 03:03:48.283
AND THEY HAVE CONSISTENTLY BEEN

03:03:48.350 --> 03:03:49.918
BLOWN OFF. FORTUNATELY, NO

03:03:49.985 --> 03:03:51.754
MEMBER, NO CALIFORNIA MEMBERS OF

03:03:51.820 --> 03:03:53.822
CONGRESS HAVE BEEN CRIMINALLY

03:03:53.889 --> 03:03:55.124
PROSECUTED. YET. WE'RE SEEING

03:03:55.190 --> 03:03:56.859
THAT ON THE EAST COAST. WE DID

03:03:56.925 --> 03:03:59.428
SEE OUR U.S. SENATOR GET TACKLED

03:03:59.495 --> 03:04:00.562
AND HANDCUFFED FOR HAVING THE

03:04:00.629 --> 03:04:05.401
GALL TO QUESTION SECRETARY NOME.

03:04:05.467 --> 03:04:08.270
SO I THINK THERE'S BEEN A LITTLE

03:04:08.337 --> 03:04:11.907
BIT OF A PITTING SB 805 AND SB

03:04:11.974 --> 03:04:13.942
627 AGAINST EACH OTHER TODAY.

03:04:14.009 --> 03:04:15.110
SENATOR PEREZ AND I, IN ADDITION

03:04:15.177 --> 03:04:17.279
TO SENATOR ARREGUIN, WE ARE TIED

03:04:17.346 --> 03:04:18.947
AT THE HIP ON THESE BILLS. THESE

03:04:19.014 --> 03:04:20.783
BILLS ARE COMPLETELY

03:04:20.849 --> 03:04:22.451
COMPLEMENTARY. THESE ARE TWO

03:04:22.518 --> 03:04:24.219
ISSUES THAT ARE THEY ARE

03:04:24.286 --> 03:04:25.487
DIFFERENT, BUT THEY ARE IN MANY

03:04:25.554 --> 03:04:29.158
WAYS THE SAME ABOUT ENSURING

03:04:29.224 --> 03:04:31.360
THAT PEOPLE KNOW WHO IS A POLICE

03:04:31.427 --> 03:04:33.462
OFFICER OR A LAW ENFORCEMENT

03:04:33.529 --> 03:04:35.531
OFFICER AND WHO ISN'T, AND THAT

03:04:35.597 --> 03:04:38.500
PEOPLE ARE NOT SUBJECTED TO THIS

03:04:38.567 --> 03:04:41.103
KIND OF TERROR, WHICH IS

03:04:41.170 --> 03:04:41.670
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AT THE

03:04:41.737 --> 03:04:43.272
FEDERAL LEVEL. AND WE WANT TO

03:04:43.338 --> 03:04:45.007
MAKE SURE THAT THAT NEVER, EVER

03:04:45.073 --> 03:04:48.243
HAPPENS AT ANY LEVEL. THESE TWO

03:04:48.310 --> 03:04:51.113
BILLS WORK IN TANDEM, AND THAT'S

03:04:51.180 --> 03:04:53.515
WHY WE SAW IN THE US SENATE BILL

03:04:53.582 --> 03:04:55.551
BY SENATOR PADILLA, THE TWO

03:04:55.617 --> 03:04:56.652
BILLS OR VERSIONS OF THEM WERE

03:04:56.718 --> 03:04:59.087
PUT INTO ONE BILL, BOTH THE

03:04:59.154 --> 03:05:00.589
MASKING AND IDENTIFICATION. THIS

03:05:00.656 --> 03:05:02.724
IS NOT ABOUT ONE OR THE OTHER.

03:05:02.791 --> 03:05:04.259
IT'S BOTH INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT

03:05:04.326 --> 03:05:05.594
IF YOU'RE WEARING A BADGE, BUT

03:05:05.661 --> 03:05:06.929
YOU'RE ALSO WEARING A SKI MASK,

03:05:06.995 --> 03:05:09.364
THAT IS STILL HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC

03:05:09.431 --> 03:05:11.633
AND TERRIFYING, AND WE SHOULDN'T

03:05:11.700 --> 03:05:16.305
BE ALLOWING IT. SB 805, LIKE SB

03:05:16.371 --> 03:05:19.308
627, CONTAINS A MISDEMEANOR IN

03:05:19.374 --> 03:05:23.912
IT, SO, YOU KNOW, I UNDERSTAND,

03:05:23.979 --> 03:05:25.113
YOU KNOW, THE CONCERNS FROM

03:05:25.180 --> 03:05:26.448
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND LIKE

03:05:26.515 --> 03:05:27.783
I SAID, I'VE BEEN A LONG

03:05:27.850 --> 03:05:30.018
SUPPORTER OF MY OWN LOCAL LAW

03:05:30.085 --> 03:05:31.820
ENFORCEMENT. THIS IS NOT ABOUT

03:05:31.887 --> 03:05:34.656
IN ANY WAY DEMONIZING. THIS IS

03:05:34.723 --> 03:05:36.258
ABOUT SETTING CLEAR STANDARDS

03:05:36.325 --> 03:05:37.826
THAT ARE APPLICABLE TO ALL LAW

03:05:37.893 --> 03:05:40.229
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. AND THIS

03:05:40.295 --> 03:05:42.064
IS SO IMPORTANT FOR THE PEOPLE

03:05:42.130 --> 03:05:44.566
OF CALIFORNIA SO FAR, TOO MANY

03:05:44.633 --> 03:05:47.236
OF WHOM ARE LIVING IN ABSOLUTE

03:05:47.302 --> 03:05:51.173
TERROR RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW, I

03:05:51.240 --> 03:05:53.742
TALKED ABOUT THIS ON THE SENATE

03:05:53.809 --> 03:05:55.577
FLOOR A COUPLE WEEKS AGO, AND

03:05:55.644 --> 03:05:57.713
I'LL REPEAT IT AGAIN TODAY THAT

03:05:57.779 --> 03:05:59.314
I WAS RECENTLY ON THE SUBWAY IN

03:05:59.381 --> 03:06:01.283
SAN FRANCISCO, SITTING NEXT TO A

03:06:01.350 --> 03:06:03.752
GUY WHO I'VE KNOWN JUST FROM THE

03:06:03.819 --> 03:06:06.221
NEIGHBORHOOD FOR 15 PLUS YEARS,

03:06:06.288 --> 03:06:10.659
WHO IS AN IMMIGRANT FROM MEXICO,

03:06:10.726 --> 03:06:12.494
RESIDENT OF THE CASTRO, WHO

03:06:12.561 --> 03:06:14.429
TURNED TO ME AND SAID, I GUESS

03:06:14.496 --> 03:06:17.332
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GO BACK TO

03:06:17.399 --> 03:06:18.834
MEXICO. HE'S LIVED HERE FOR 30

03:06:18.901 --> 03:06:20.769
YEARS AND HE'S A CITIZEN. THAT'S

03:06:20.836 --> 03:06:22.271
WHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW. AND

03:06:22.337 --> 03:06:23.906
YES, IT'S ABOUT UNDOCUMENTED

03:06:23.972 --> 03:06:26.174
PEOPLE, BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT

03:06:26.241 --> 03:06:28.010
IMMIGRANTS WHO ARE HERE WITH

03:06:28.076 --> 03:06:30.045
PAPERS AND EVEN US CITIZENS

03:06:30.112 --> 03:06:31.580
BECAUSE THEY'RE THREATENING TO

03:06:31.647 --> 03:06:33.048
DENATURALIZE PEOPLE. AND NOW

03:06:33.115 --> 03:06:34.950
EVEN A NATURAL BORN US CITIZEN,

03:06:35.017 --> 03:06:36.351
HE'S THREATENING TO REVOKE

03:06:36.418 --> 03:06:38.186
CITIZENSHIP, THIS FASCIST STATE

03:06:38.253 --> 03:06:40.622
THAT THEY'RE SETTING UP IS ONLY

03:06:40.689 --> 03:06:42.457
GROWING, PARTICULARLY WITH THE

03:06:42.524 --> 03:06:44.626
$45 BILLION THAT THEY JUST PUKED

03:06:44.693 --> 03:06:47.563
ONTO ICE TO CONTINUE TO BUILD

03:06:47.629 --> 03:06:49.598
THIS POLICE STATE. IT'S ONLY

03:06:49.665 --> 03:06:51.533
GROWING. WE HAVE TO GET OUT IN

03:06:51.600 --> 03:06:52.768
FRONT OF IT. IT'S TIME TO SET

03:06:52.834 --> 03:06:55.404
CLEAR STANDARDS FOR ALL LAW

03:06:55.470 --> 03:06:56.471
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. AND I

03:06:56.538 --> 03:06:58.206
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE

03:06:58.273 --> 03:06:59.474
VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH,

03:06:59.541 --> 03:07:02.244
SENATOR. SO, COLLEAGUES, I HAVE

03:07:02.311 --> 03:07:03.445
A LITTLE BIT LONGER OF A

03:07:03.512 --> 03:07:04.413
RECOMMENDATION TODAY, BUT THE

03:07:04.479 --> 03:07:06.515
SHORT ANSWER IS I WILL BE

03:07:06.582 --> 03:07:07.416
RECOMMENDING AN AYE. I'M GOING

03:07:07.482 --> 03:07:09.351
TO START BY SAYING I'M NOT OFTEN

03:07:09.418 --> 03:07:10.419
INCORRECT, BUT I WAS INCORRECT

03:07:10.485 --> 03:07:11.920
IN THIS INSTANCE. AND I DO

03:07:11.987 --> 03:07:13.455
BELIEVE IN ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE

03:07:13.522 --> 03:07:14.556
VICE MAYOR'S CONCERN. THE

03:07:14.623 --> 03:07:15.457
COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ACTUALLY DO

03:07:15.524 --> 03:07:16.291
ADDRESS THE INSTANCE OF AN

03:07:16.358 --> 03:07:18.260
OFFICER WEARING A MASK FOR

03:07:18.327 --> 03:07:19.461
PURPOSES OF ANY ENVIRONMENTAL

03:07:19.528 --> 03:07:20.929
HAZARD. I WOULD SIMPLY NOTE THAT

03:07:20.996 --> 03:07:22.798
B1, WHICH DEFINES A FACE

03:07:22.864 --> 03:07:24.466
COVERING AND B2 HAVE A COUPLE

03:07:24.533 --> 03:07:25.434
EXEMPTIONS, AND I'LL JUST READ

03:07:25.500 --> 03:07:28.570
THIS PORTION TWO SUB TWO AN N95

03:07:28.637 --> 03:07:30.105
MEDICAL MASK OR SURGICAL MASK.

03:07:30.172 --> 03:07:31.340
I'M GOING TO SKIP AHEAD HERE

03:07:31.406 --> 03:07:33.775
BECAUSE THERE'S MORE NECESSARY

03:07:33.842 --> 03:07:35.043
TO PROTECT AGAINST EXPOSURE TO

03:07:35.110 --> 03:07:37.045
ANY TOXIN, GAS, SMOKE, OR ANY

03:07:37.112 --> 03:07:38.580
OTHER HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENTAL

03:07:38.647 --> 03:07:40.115
CONDITION, NOT JUST LIMITED TO

03:07:40.182 --> 03:07:42.250
WILDLAND FIRES. SO I STAND

03:07:42.317 --> 03:07:43.785
CORRECTED, AND I WANTED THAT TO

03:07:43.852 --> 03:07:44.753
BE EXTRAORDINARILY CLEAR.

03:07:44.820 --> 03:07:45.821
HOPEFULLY, THAT ADDRESSES AT

03:07:45.887 --> 03:07:47.522
LEAST THAT NARROW CONCERN OF THE

03:07:47.589 --> 03:07:49.391
VICE CHAIR. I WANT TO THANK THE

03:07:49.458 --> 03:07:51.026
SENATOR FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD.

03:07:51.093 --> 03:07:52.227
WE'RE HERE TODAY BECAUSE WE HAVE

03:07:52.294 --> 03:07:53.495
A DICTATOR IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

03:07:53.562 --> 03:07:55.564
WE HAVE A TYRANT. WE HAVE

03:07:55.631 --> 03:07:56.598
SOMEONE WHO IS UNFIT TO SERVE IN

03:07:56.665 --> 03:07:58.400
THE OFFICE, SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN

03:07:58.467 --> 03:07:59.801
CONVICTED 34 TIMES AND HAS BEEN

03:07:59.868 --> 03:08:01.303
HELD TO NO ACCOUNT, SOMEONE WHO

03:08:01.370 --> 03:08:03.105
SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM POWER

03:08:03.171 --> 03:08:03.739
IMMEDIATELY. THAT'S NOT REALLY

03:08:03.805 --> 03:08:05.107
WHAT THE BILL IS ABOUT. THIS

03:08:05.173 --> 03:08:07.075
BILL IS ABOUT PROTECTING OUR

03:08:07.142 --> 03:08:08.543
COMMUNITIES. WE HAVE SEEN ACROSS

03:08:08.610 --> 03:08:10.712
THE STATE AND ESPECIALLY IN LOS

03:08:10.779 --> 03:08:13.915
ANGELES, ICE TERRORIZE OUR

03:08:13.982 --> 03:08:15.183
COMMUNITIES. AND IT'S

03:08:15.250 --> 03:08:17.252
FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG. WHEN YOU

03:08:17.319 --> 03:08:18.453
LOOK AT WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

03:08:18.520 --> 03:08:19.655
DOING, LOOK NO FURTHER THAN

03:08:19.721 --> 03:08:21.590
PROJECT 2025. WE'VE SEEN THIS

03:08:21.657 --> 03:08:23.925
PLAYBOOK PLAY OUT, REFERENCED

03:08:23.992 --> 03:08:26.461
1930S GERMANY. SECRET POLICE

03:08:26.528 --> 03:08:29.031
HAVE NO PLACE IN THE STATE OF

03:08:29.097 --> 03:08:29.631
CALIFORNIA. THIS IS WHAT THE

03:08:29.698 --> 03:08:31.833
BILL GUARDS AGAINST. NOW TO THE

03:08:31.900 --> 03:08:33.402
OPPOSITION TESTIMONY. I

03:08:33.468 --> 03:08:34.369
UNDERSTAND THE PERSPECTIVE OF

03:08:34.436 --> 03:08:36.838
AND I WANT TO BE CRYSTAL CLEAR

03:08:36.905 --> 03:08:37.539
HERE. I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY

03:08:37.606 --> 03:08:39.441
DOCUMENTED INSTANCE WHERE LOCAL

03:08:39.508 --> 03:08:40.008
OR STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE

03:08:40.075 --> 03:08:42.277
DOING ANY OF THIS. AND I GET

03:08:42.344 --> 03:08:43.378
YOUR CONCERN, AND I GET THE

03:08:43.445 --> 03:08:45.514
DESIRE TO NOT WANT TO BE LOOPED

03:08:45.580 --> 03:08:46.581
IN. YOU'RE NOT DOING THIS.

03:08:46.648 --> 03:08:47.883
YOU'RE NOT TERRORIZING OUR

03:08:47.949 --> 03:08:48.483
COMMUNITY. AND I GET THAT. BUT

03:08:48.550 --> 03:08:50.986
THIS BILL IS BIGGER THAN JUST

03:08:51.053 --> 03:08:52.020
YOU. THIS IS ABOUT EXPRESSING

03:08:52.087 --> 03:08:53.455
OUR VALUES AS A STATE. THIS IS

03:08:53.522 --> 03:08:54.923
ABOUT STAYING, ABOUT SAYING

03:08:54.990 --> 03:08:56.692
WHETHER IT IS FEDERAL LAW

03:08:56.758 --> 03:08:57.693
ENFORCEMENT OR LOCAL OR STATE.

03:08:57.759 --> 03:08:59.528
THERE IS NO PLACE FOR THE

03:08:59.594 --> 03:09:00.762
ACTIVITIES OF SECRET POLICE IN A

03:09:00.829 --> 03:09:02.431
FREE AND DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY.

03:09:02.497 --> 03:09:04.199
IT'S A SAD DAY THAT WE HAVE TO

03:09:04.266 --> 03:09:06.368
TALK ABOUT A BILL LIKE THIS, BUT

03:09:06.435 --> 03:09:07.803
FAILURE TO PASS THIS BILL

03:09:07.869 --> 03:09:08.904
JEOPARDIZES EVERY SINGLE ONE OF

03:09:08.970 --> 03:09:11.173
US IN OUR FREEDOM. I'M PROUD TO

03:09:11.239 --> 03:09:12.574
SUPPORT THIS BILL. I'M PROUD TO

03:09:12.641 --> 03:09:14.209
RECOMMEND, AND I AND SENATOR,

03:09:14.276 --> 03:09:15.544
I'D BE HONORED TO HAVE YOU ON,

03:09:15.610 --> 03:09:17.546
IF YOU'D HAVE ME ON AS A

03:09:17.612 --> 03:09:18.480
COAUTHOR. WITH THAT, LET'S

03:09:18.547 --> 03:09:21.550
CONDUCT THE ROLE. THANK YOU. ON

03:11:04.186 --> 03:11:05.921
ADDRESS THE VERY REAL PROBLEM OF

03:11:05.987 --> 03:11:08.456
SALE OF STOLEN GOODS ON OUR

03:11:08.523 --> 03:11:10.492
STREETS AND THE HARM THAT IT'S

03:11:10.559 --> 03:11:12.360
DOING TO OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND

03:11:12.427 --> 03:11:15.564
TO OUR AMAZING STREET VENDOR

03:11:15.630 --> 03:11:18.033
ECOSYSTEM. I'M I WANT TO START

03:11:18.099 --> 03:11:19.868
BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE

03:11:19.935 --> 03:11:21.903

SO SB 276, AS I MENTIONED,

03:11:28.043 --> 03:11:29.277

03:11:29.344 --> 03:11:32.214
ARE BASICALLY THERE'S THEFT IN

03:11:32.280 --> 03:11:34.749
OUR STORES AND THEN THOSE GOODS

WHILE WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE

03:22:24.265 --> 03:22:25.633
AUTHOR AND MANY ISSUES THAT YOU

03:22:25.700 --> 03:22:27.134
CHAMPIONED, WE ARE IN RESPECTFUL

03:22:27.201 --> 03:22:29.837
OPPOSITION TO THIS PROPOSAL. SB

03:22:29.904 --> 03:22:31.639
276 WOULD DANGEROUSLY,

03:22:31.706 --> 03:22:33.074
DANGEROUSLY ROLLBACK THE

03:22:33.140 --> 03:22:34.175
DECRIMINALIZATION OF STREET

03:22:34.242 --> 03:22:35.142
VENDING, WHICH WAS ACCOMPLISHED

03:22:35.209 --> 03:22:36.978
WITH THE SAFE SIDEWALK VENDING

03:22:37.044 --> 03:22:38.813
ACT, AUTHORED BY THEN-SENATOR

03:22:38.880 --> 03:22:40.615
LATA. WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE

03:22:40.681 --> 03:22:41.716
AUTHOR NOT IMPOSING A

03:22:41.782 --> 03:22:42.683
MISDEMEANOR UNTIL A FOURTH

03:22:42.750 --> 03:22:44.919
CHARGE WITHIN 18 MONTHS, WE HAVE

03:22:44.986 --> 03:22:46.854
SERIOUS CONCERNS WITH IMPOSING A

03:22:46.921 --> 03:22:48.789
MISDEMEANOR AT ALL. AS THE AS

03:22:48.856 --> 03:22:50.258
THERE ARE, THERE'S A

03:22:50.324 --> 03:22:51.425
CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF EVIDENCE

03:22:51.492 --> 03:22:53.394
THAT SUGGESTS LONGER SENTENCING

03:22:53.461 --> 03:22:53.995
DOES LITTLE TO DETER CRIME,

03:22:54.061 --> 03:22:56.898
WHICH I KNOW I REPEAT A LOT UP

03:22:56.964 --> 03:22:58.366
HERE AT THIS TABLE. SO STUDIES

03:22:58.432 --> 03:23:00.034
HAVE CONCLUDED THAT CERTAINTY OF

03:23:00.101 --> 03:23:01.369
PUNISHMENT HAS A GREATER

03:23:01.435 --> 03:23:02.837
DETERRENCE THAN THE SEVERITY OF

03:23:02.904 --> 03:23:05.072
THE PUNISHMENT ITSELF. RIGHT. SO

03:23:05.139 --> 03:23:06.974
I POSED THIS QUESTION TO THE

03:23:07.041 --> 03:23:08.276
POLICYMAKERS IN THIS ROOM. IF

03:23:08.342 --> 03:23:10.111
OUR OBJECTIVE HERE IS TO DETER

03:23:10.177 --> 03:23:11.979
PEOPLE FROM SELLING STOLEN

03:23:12.046 --> 03:23:13.381
MERCHANDISE ON PUBLIC SIDEWALKS,

03:23:13.447 --> 03:23:14.849
WHAT EVIDENCE DO WE HAVE TO

03:23:14.916 --> 03:23:16.017
OFFER THAT THE CRIMINAL

03:23:16.083 --> 03:23:17.952
PENALTIES IN THIS BILL WOULD

03:23:18.019 --> 03:23:19.787
RESOLVE THIS ISSUE? AS THE

03:23:19.854 --> 03:23:21.556
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT ON

03:23:21.622 --> 03:23:24.091
PAGES 9 TO 11, THERE ARE

03:23:24.158 --> 03:23:24.859
NUMEROUS PENALTIES THAT CAN

03:23:24.926 --> 03:23:26.661
CURRENTLY BE USED TO ADDRESS THE

03:23:26.727 --> 03:23:27.995
TYPE OF RETAIL THEFT AND FENCING

03:23:28.062 --> 03:23:30.031
AT ISSUE IN THIS BILL, INCLUDING

03:23:30.097 --> 03:23:33.434
PENAL CODE SECTION 496. SO

03:23:33.501 --> 03:23:34.835
AGAIN, TO REITERATE, LAW

03:23:34.902 --> 03:23:37.471
ENFORCEMENT ALREADY HAS TOOLS TO

03:23:37.538 --> 03:23:39.907
GET AFTER WHAT THIS BILL IS

03:23:39.974 --> 03:23:43.477
TRYING TO RESOLVE. THE PUNITIVE

03:23:43.544 --> 03:23:44.845
MEASURES PROPOSED IN THIS BILL

03:23:44.912 --> 03:23:46.113
WOULD DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT

03:23:46.180 --> 03:23:47.481
VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES,

03:23:47.548 --> 03:23:48.616
PARTICULARLY PEOPLE WHO ARE LOW

03:23:48.683 --> 03:23:50.017
INCOME AND IMMIGRANTS THAT MAY

03:23:50.084 --> 03:23:52.286
RESORT TO STREET VENDING AS A

03:23:52.353 --> 03:23:53.220
PRIMARY MEANS OF SURVIVAL.

03:23:53.287 --> 03:23:54.789
CRIMINALIZING UNPERMITTED

03:23:54.855 --> 03:23:56.557
VENDING RISK, WORSENING ECONOMIC

03:23:56.624 --> 03:23:58.659
HARDSHIP, AND DEEPENING EXISTING

03:23:58.726 --> 03:23:59.894
INEQUITIES. AND I ALSO WANT TO

03:23:59.961 --> 03:24:01.262
POINT OUT TO THE COMMITTEE ON

03:24:01.329 --> 03:24:02.530
PAGE 11, IN THE COMMITTEE

03:24:02.597 --> 03:24:05.533
ANALYSIS WITH THE STATED REASON

03:24:05.600 --> 03:24:07.335
FOR THE URGENCY CLAUSE IS

03:24:07.401 --> 03:24:09.103
BECAUSE OF THIS RAMPANT INCREASE

03:24:09.170 --> 03:24:12.406
IN RETAIL THEFT. HERE IN THE

03:24:12.473 --> 03:24:14.108
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS, IT SAYS AS

03:24:14.175 --> 03:24:15.876
2024 CRIME RATES IN SAN

03:24:15.943 --> 03:24:17.478
FRANCISCO DROPPED TO THEIR

03:24:17.545 --> 03:24:19.614
LOWEST POINT IN TWO DECADES. AND

03:24:19.680 --> 03:24:21.749
SPECIFIC TO PROPERTY CRIME, SAN

03:24:21.816 --> 03:24:23.184
FRANCISCO REDUCTION IN PROPERTY

03:24:23.250 --> 03:24:24.552
CRIME FROM THE LAST YEAR WAS THE

03:24:24.619 --> 03:24:26.087
LARGEST OF ANY COMPARABLE SIZED

03:24:26.153 --> 03:24:28.322
CITY. SO FOR THESE REASONS, WE

03:24:28.389 --> 03:24:30.858
DO NOT FIND THIS BILL TO BE

03:24:30.925 --> 03:24:31.459
NECESSARY AND WE RESPECTFULLY

03:24:31.525 --> 03:24:33.527
URGE YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU.

03:24:33.594 --> 03:24:35.396
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANYONE ELSE

03:24:35.463 --> 03:24:36.497
IN OPPOSITION? PLEASE STEP UP.

03:24:36.564 --> 03:24:37.665
NAME? ORGANIZATION. YOUR

03:24:37.732 --> 03:24:40.134
POSITION PLEASE. GWEN GUNHEIM,

03:24:40.201 --> 03:24:42.303
ON BEHALF OF SAN FRANCISCO

03:24:42.370 --> 03:24:44.271
PUBLIC DEFENDERS, RESPECTFULLY

03:24:44.338 --> 03:24:48.676
OPPOSE. SERGEANT, DO WE HAVE

03:24:48.743 --> 03:24:51.278
ANYONE ELSE? NOPE. OKAY, WE'LL

03:24:51.345 --> 03:24:53.781
BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE, MR.

03:24:53.848 --> 03:24:56.684
GONZALES. AND THANK YOU TO THE

03:24:56.751 --> 03:24:57.485
AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS

03:24:57.551 --> 03:24:58.886
FORWARD. WE FACE THIS PROBLEM IN

03:24:58.953 --> 03:25:02.256
LOS ANGELES A LOT, IN A LOT OF

03:25:02.323 --> 03:25:03.691
CORNERS. I'M JUST I'M JUST

03:25:03.758 --> 03:25:04.291
CONCERNED ABOUT A COUPLE OF

03:25:04.358 --> 03:25:05.860
PIECES, BUT I THINK IT'S ALREADY

03:25:05.926 --> 03:25:07.128
BEEN ADDRESSED. BUT IT SAYS

03:25:07.194 --> 03:25:07.928
IMPOSING CRIMINAL PENALTIES ON

03:25:07.995 --> 03:25:09.397
SIDEWALK VENDORS THAT SELL

03:25:09.463 --> 03:25:10.665
SPECIFIC GOODS WITHOUT A PERMIT.

03:25:10.731 --> 03:25:13.234
SO AND THE PROPERTY THAT WOULD

03:25:13.300 --> 03:25:14.435
BE RESTRICTED FROM SELLING WOULD

03:25:14.502 --> 03:25:15.870
BE THE ITEMS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN

03:25:15.936 --> 03:25:17.571
SUBJECT TO RETAIL THEFT. WHAT

03:25:17.638 --> 03:25:18.506
ARE THE ITEMS THAT WE'RE

03:25:18.572 --> 03:25:20.041
REFERENCING? YEAH. SO THE WAY IT

03:25:20.107 --> 03:25:22.677
WILL, FIRST OF ALL, ANYONE WITH

03:25:22.743 --> 03:25:24.412
A PERMIT IS SIMPLY THE BILL

03:25:24.478 --> 03:25:25.746
DOESN'T APPLY TO THEM. SO

03:25:25.813 --> 03:25:28.683
SELLING WITH A PERMIT COMPLETELY

03:25:28.749 --> 03:25:30.951
EXCLUDED FROM THIS BILL, SELLING

03:25:31.018 --> 03:25:32.286
PREPARED FOODS, EXCLUDED FROM

03:25:32.353 --> 03:25:33.954
THE BILL. THE BILL JUST SIMPLY

03:25:34.021 --> 03:25:36.257
DOES NOT APPLY TO PREPARED

03:25:36.323 --> 03:25:40.728
FOODS. WHAT IT DOES APPLY FOR,

03:25:40.795 --> 03:25:42.430
WHAT IT DOES. AND THAT'S EVEN IF

03:25:42.496 --> 03:25:44.565
YOU ARE SELLING PREPARED FOODS

03:25:44.632 --> 03:25:45.900
WITHOUT A PERMIT, IT DOESN'T

03:25:45.966 --> 03:25:46.600
APPLY TO YOU. WHAT THE BILL

03:25:46.667 --> 03:25:48.869
WOULD ALLOW IS FOR THE BOARD OF

03:25:48.936 --> 03:25:51.005
SUPERVISORS TO PREPARE AND ADOPT

03:25:51.072 --> 03:25:54.608
A LIST OF COMMONLY STOLEN GOODS.

03:25:54.675 --> 03:25:57.912
AND THEN IF YOU ARE SELLING THE

03:25:57.978 --> 03:26:00.748
GOODS THAT ARE ON THAT LIST

03:26:00.815 --> 03:26:03.984
WITHOUT A PERMIT, THEN YOU CAN

03:26:04.051 --> 03:26:07.488
BE CITED. AND SO THAT'S THE

03:26:07.555 --> 03:26:08.689
STRUCTURE OF THE BILL. AND IT'S

03:26:08.756 --> 03:26:11.125
IT STARTS OUT AS A WARNING. AND

03:26:11.192 --> 03:26:12.960
THEN IT'S INFRACTION.

03:26:13.027 --> 03:26:14.862
INFRACTION. AND IT'S NOT UNTIL

03:26:14.929 --> 03:26:16.630
THE FOURTH VIOLATION THAT IT

03:26:16.697 --> 03:26:18.733
WOULD BE POTENTIALLY CHARGEABLE

03:26:18.799 --> 03:26:20.568
AS A, AS A MISDEMEANOR. AND

03:26:20.634 --> 03:26:22.269
UNDER CURRENT LAW, WHICH I

03:26:22.336 --> 03:26:25.239
SUPPORTED BACK IN 2018, IT I

03:26:25.306 --> 03:26:27.808
THINK IN GENERAL, IT WAS A GOOD

03:26:27.875 --> 03:26:28.776
THING TO MOVE ENFORCEMENT OF

03:26:28.843 --> 03:26:30.544
STREET VENDING AWAY FROM THE

03:26:30.611 --> 03:26:32.379
POLICE AND TOWARDS

03:26:32.446 --> 03:26:33.881
ADMINISTRATIVE IN THIS LIMITED

03:26:33.948 --> 03:26:35.616
SITUATION. IT'S CREATING SOME

03:26:35.683 --> 03:26:37.451
CHALLENGES. WELL, THE REASON WHY

03:26:37.518 --> 03:26:39.286
I'M ASKING IS BECAUSE IN LOS

03:26:39.353 --> 03:26:40.154
ANGELES, SPECIFICALLY, MACARTHUR

03:26:40.221 --> 03:26:42.757
PARK, FOLKS WILL SELL SHAMPOO.

03:26:42.823 --> 03:26:45.326
PAPER TOWELS LIKELY DON'T HAVE A

03:26:45.392 --> 03:26:47.561
PERMIT. THE PERSON IS LIKELY

03:26:47.628 --> 03:26:48.596
UNDOCUMENTED. SO I'M JUST

03:26:48.662 --> 03:26:50.331
CONCERNED ABOUT THOSE PIECES.

03:26:50.397 --> 03:26:51.732
AND AS IT PERTAINS TO THIS, I

03:26:51.799 --> 03:26:54.201
MEAN, I THINK IT'S A STEP IN THE

03:26:54.268 --> 03:26:55.302
RIGHT DIRECTION. I JUST DON'T

03:26:55.369 --> 03:26:56.370
WANT TO PENALIZE THOSE

03:27:05.980 --> 03:27:07.782

THE ENVIRONMENT. AND THAT'S WHY

03:27:34.108 --> 03:27:35.209
THE STREET VENDOR ASSOCIATION

03:28:12.213 --> 03:28:14.648
WITH NEIGHBORHOODS, A SOLUTION

03:28:14.715 --> 03:28:17.785
THAT WILL MAKE AN IMPACT. WE SEE

03:28:17.852 --> 03:28:19.486
SITUATIONS WHERE DIRECTLY IN

03:28:19.553 --> 03:28:21.555
FRONT OF SMALL BUSINESSES, THEY

03:28:21.622 --> 03:28:23.958
ARE HAVING PEOPLE SELL ITEMS

03:28:24.024 --> 03:28:26.460
THAT ARE VERY LIKELY, IN MANY

03:28:26.527 --> 03:28:29.463
CASES, STOLEN. IT IS AN

03:28:29.530 --> 03:28:30.831

03:28:43.177 --> 03:28:46.680
COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE AND ALSO

03:28:46.747 --> 03:28:47.781

THINK WE CAN SUPPORT STREET

03:29:10.804 --> 03:29:12.539
VENDING, WHICH ALSO IS VERY

03:29:12.606 --> 03:29:13.707
IMPORTANT. AND ALSO THESE ARE

03:29:13.774 --> 03:29:15.142
MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY, AND

03:29:15.209 --> 03:29:16.443
MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE

03:29:16.510 --> 03:29:17.978
OPPORTUNITIES TO DO THAT WITH

03:29:18.045 --> 03:29:20.180

03:41:15.729 --> 03:41:17.631
FIVE YEAR PERIOD MORE THAN

03:41:17.697 --> 03:41:21.835
DOUBLED TO 1400 AND 4200,

03:41:21.901 --> 03:41:23.770
RESPECTIVELY. AND THOSE WHO AND

03:41:23.837 --> 03:41:25.472
THOSE STATS DON'T INCLUDE MY

03:41:25.538 --> 03:41:27.073
PROVIDER, KAISER, THE BIGGEST

03:41:27.140 --> 03:41:29.109
CHOP SHOP ON THE WEST COAST.

03:41:29.175 --> 03:41:30.844
THESE ARE NOT MICROSCOPIC

03:41:30.910 --> 03:41:33.179
NUMBERS. DON'T BLAME MY PARENTS,

03:41:33.246 --> 03:41:34.848
WHO WERE COERCED INTO CONSENTING

03:41:34.914 --> 03:41:36.983
BECAUSE PUBERTY BLOCKERS,

03:41:37.050 --> 03:41:38.018
TESTOSTERONE AND SURGERIES WERE

03:41:38.084 --> 03:41:39.519
THE ONLY TREATMENT OFFERED TO

03:41:39.586 --> 03:41:41.655
ADDRESS MY CUTTING, SUICIDAL

03:41:41.721 --> 03:41:43.223
IDEATION AND INABILITY TO

03:41:43.289 --> 03:41:45.325
FUNCTION. NOT ONE PROVIDER

03:41:45.392 --> 03:41:47.527
EXPLORED MY AUTISTIC TRAITS. NOT

03:41:47.594 --> 03:41:48.862
ONE STEPPED IN TO CONSIDER MY

03:41:48.928 --> 03:41:50.563
CHILDHOOD. SEXUAL ABUSE WAS THE

03:41:50.630 --> 03:41:52.766
REASON I WANTED TO SHED MY

03:41:52.832 --> 03:41:54.267
FEMALE BODY. NOT ONE SAID YOUR

03:41:54.334 --> 03:41:56.069
DAUGHTER IS PERFECT THE WAY SHE

03:41:56.136 --> 03:41:57.804
IS NOW. THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED

03:41:57.871 --> 03:42:00.807
HATEFUL. THIS BILL IS DESIGNED

03:42:00.874 --> 03:42:02.676
TO PROTECT MEDICAL PROVIDERS WHO

03:42:02.742 --> 03:42:04.244
HARMED ME AND ARE HARMING OTHER

03:42:04.310 --> 03:42:06.012
CHILDREN WHO RUN AWAY TO THIS

03:42:06.079 --> 03:42:08.314
STATE UNDER SB 107, OR WHO

03:42:08.381 --> 03:42:09.416
VIOLATE SAFEGUARDING LAWS IN

03:42:09.482 --> 03:42:11.584
THEIR OWN STATES. ALL OF YOU

03:42:11.651 --> 03:42:12.519
SHOULD BE PANICKED AND ASHAMED

03:42:12.585 --> 03:42:16.056
AS YOU SIT IN SILENCE OR LOOK AT

03:42:16.122 --> 03:42:21.227
ME WITH VENOM VÚI KNOW. I AM

03:42:21.294 --> 03:42:23.496
BETH, BORN OF OUR DUTY. MY

03:42:23.563 --> 03:42:25.265
DAUGHTER BELIEVED THAT SHE WAS A

03:42:25.331 --> 03:42:27.400
TRANSGENDER BOY. SHE WAS SO

03:42:27.467 --> 03:42:28.735
ADAMANT THAT SHE CONVINCED A

03:42:28.802 --> 03:42:31.037
COURT TO CHANGE HER NAME AND SEX

03:42:31.104 --> 03:42:32.906
MARKER ON HER BIRTH CERTIFICATE.

03:42:32.972 --> 03:42:34.541
AGAINST MY CHALLENGE, SHE WAS

03:42:34.607 --> 03:42:36.743
15. SHE ALSO BEGGED FOR HORMONES

03:42:36.810 --> 03:42:38.545
AND TO HAVE HER BREAST REMOVED

03:42:38.611 --> 03:42:41.114
AND I REFUSED CONSENT. SHE IS

03:42:41.181 --> 03:42:43.717
NOW 19, NEVER MEDICALIZED, AND

03:42:43.783 --> 03:42:45.719
HAS EMBRACED HER FEMALE BODY.

03:42:45.785 --> 03:42:48.955
SHE WAS NEVER TRANSGENDER. NO

03:42:49.022 --> 03:42:52.258
ONE IS NO ONE. GENDER IDENTITY

03:42:52.325 --> 03:42:55.128
IS A CANARD OR A FALSE BELIEF.

03:42:55.195 --> 03:42:57.263
THIS IS WHY YOU MUST VOTE NO ON

03:42:57.330 --> 03:43:01.267
SB 497. HOW BRAZEN AND FOOLISH

03:43:01.334 --> 03:43:03.336
OF THE SENATOR TO ADMIT IN HIS

03:43:03.403 --> 03:43:05.739
BILL THAT IT IS HIS INTENT TO

03:43:05.805 --> 03:43:06.940
VIOLATE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

03:43:07.006 --> 03:43:08.808
EXECUTIVE ORDERS. HAVEN'T YOU

03:43:08.875 --> 03:43:11.010
BEEN PAYING ATTENTION? PARENTS

03:43:11.077 --> 03:43:14.547
LIKE ME ARE FILLING THE FTC AND

03:43:14.614 --> 03:43:17.016
DOJ TIP LINES WITH EVIDENCE OF

03:43:17.083 --> 03:43:19.285
HOW THIS STATE IS SACRIFICING

03:43:19.352 --> 03:43:21.387
CHILDREN AND VULNERABLE ADULTS

03:43:21.454 --> 03:43:24.657
TO THE TRANSGENDER AGENDA. DO

03:43:24.724 --> 03:43:27.861
YOU REALLY THINK YOUR FORMER

03:43:27.927 --> 03:43:29.929
COLLEAGUE BILL SALLY AND HIS

03:43:29.996 --> 03:43:31.531
BOSS, HARMEET DHILLON, WHO IS

03:43:31.598 --> 03:43:33.299
ALSO MY FORMER ATTORNEY, ARE

03:43:33.366 --> 03:43:34.734
UNAWARE OF YOUR INTENTIONAL

03:43:34.801 --> 03:43:35.835
VIOLATIONS OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS

03:43:35.902 --> 03:43:38.138
AND FEDERAL LAW AND THAT THEY

03:43:38.204 --> 03:43:39.773
WILL NOT STRIKE BACK WITH THE

03:43:39.839 --> 03:43:41.908
FORCE OF THE SUPREME LAW OF THIS

03:43:41.975 --> 03:43:43.510
NATION, WHICH, IN CASE YOU HAVE

03:43:43.576 --> 03:43:45.145
FORGOTTEN, IS THE US

03:43:45.211 --> 03:43:47.347
CONSTITUTION. THE FULL FAITH AND

03:43:47.413 --> 03:43:49.182
CREDIT CLAUSE REQUIRES THAT EACH

03:43:49.249 --> 03:43:51.050
STATE HONOR THE PUBLIC ACTS AND

03:43:51.117 --> 03:43:53.086
JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS OF OTHER

03:43:53.153 --> 03:43:55.121
STATES. THIS IS A CONSTITUTIONAL

03:43:55.188 --> 03:43:56.990
MANDATE THAT HAS HELD OUR UNION

03:43:57.056 --> 03:43:59.492
TOGETHER FOR OVER TWO CENTURIES.

03:43:59.559 --> 03:44:01.995
SB 497 DIRECTLY VIOLATES THIS

03:44:02.061 --> 03:44:03.396
PRINCIPLE BY INTERFERING WITH

03:44:03.463 --> 03:44:05.064
THE LEGITIMATE AUTHORITY OF OUT

03:44:05.131 --> 03:44:06.399
OF STATE COURTS AND OTHER

03:44:06.466 --> 03:44:07.767
GOVERNMENTAL ACTORS TO ACCESS

03:44:07.834 --> 03:44:09.736
RECORDS OF MEDICAL TREATMENTS,

03:44:09.803 --> 03:44:12.772
AS WELL AS TRACK TESTOSTERONE, A

03:44:12.839 --> 03:44:14.340
SCHEDULE THREE DRUG THAT CARRIES

03:44:14.407 --> 03:44:16.442
WITH IT THE RISK OF LIVER

03:44:16.509 --> 03:44:17.544
CANCER, INCREASE HEART ATTACKS,

03:44:17.610 --> 03:44:18.711
INCONTINENCE AND FERTILITY, AND

03:44:18.778 --> 03:44:20.814
A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER LIFELONG

03:44:20.880 --> 03:44:22.916
AILMENTS. FOR WHAT PURPOSE ARE

03:44:22.982 --> 03:44:24.450
YOU PROTECTING THE DRUG

03:44:24.517 --> 03:44:25.852
PRESCRIBERS WHO ARE HARMING

03:44:25.919 --> 03:44:29.489
FEMALE BODIES? VOTE NO ON SB

03:44:29.556 --> 03:44:33.827
497. OKAY, THAT COMPLETES

03:44:33.893 --> 03:44:35.528
OPPOSITION TESTIMONY. OTHER ME

03:44:35.595 --> 03:44:36.996
TO'S COME FORWARD AT THIS TIME.

03:44:37.063 --> 03:44:38.898
PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME, YOUR

03:44:38.965 --> 03:44:39.866
ORGANIZATION AND YOUR POSITION,

03:44:39.933 --> 03:44:42.001
WHICH IS PRESUMABLY TO OPPOSE

03:44:42.068 --> 03:44:44.637
DAVID BULLOCK SERVING FAMILY

03:44:44.704 --> 03:44:45.505
VALUES AND MOMS FOR LIBERTY. WE

03:44:45.572 --> 03:44:48.808
ARE IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU.

03:44:48.875 --> 03:44:51.511
GREG BURT, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE

03:44:51.578 --> 03:44:53.112
CALIFORNIA FAMILY COUNCIL AND

03:44:53.179 --> 03:44:54.347
STRONG OPPOSITION. THANK YOU.

03:44:54.414 --> 03:44:55.582
THANK YOU BOTH. FINAL CALL.

03:44:55.648 --> 03:44:57.917
ANYONE ELSE HOPING TO BE HEARD

03:44:57.984 --> 03:44:58.985
ON THE BILL? OKAY. SEEING NO

03:44:59.052 --> 03:44:59.886
AFFIRMATIVE RESPONSE, WE'RE

03:44:59.953 --> 03:45:02.188
GOING TO TURN IT BACK TO THE

03:45:02.255 --> 03:45:03.189
DAIS NOW FOR QUESTIONS OR

03:45:03.256 --> 03:45:04.290
COMMENTS. DOES ANY MEMBER OF THE

03:45:04.357 --> 03:45:06.259
COMMITTEE HAVE A QUESTION OR A

03:45:06.326 --> 03:45:07.527
COMMENT TO EITHER MR. WIENER OR

03:45:07.594 --> 03:45:09.896
ANY OF THE WITNESSES? MR. HANEY,

03:45:09.963 --> 03:45:12.298
THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR AND THE

03:45:12.365 --> 03:45:14.901
SPONSORS. I THINK IN OUR STATE,

03:45:14.968 --> 03:45:18.104
WHEN PEOPLE ACCESS HEALTH CARE,

03:45:18.171 --> 03:45:19.439
WHATEVER THAT IS, THEY THEY

03:45:19.505 --> 03:45:21.741
EXPECT THAT TO BE BETWEEN THEM

03:45:21.808 --> 03:45:24.444
AND THEIR DOCTOR. AND

03:45:24.510 --> 03:45:25.578
UNFORTUNATELY AND TRAGICALLY,

03:45:25.645 --> 03:45:28.147
WHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW ARE

03:45:28.214 --> 03:45:30.016
PEOPLE BEING CRIMINALIZED FOR

03:45:30.083 --> 03:45:32.118
SEEKING CERTAIN TYPES OF CARE OR

03:45:32.185 --> 03:45:34.287
FOR PROVIDING THAT CARE. AND WE

03:45:34.354 --> 03:45:35.421
SHOULDN'T BE IN THIS PLACE WHERE

03:45:35.488 --> 03:45:37.190
WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO TAKE

03:45:37.257 --> 03:45:39.325
ADDITIONAL MEASURES TO PROTECT

03:45:39.392 --> 03:45:40.760
PEOPLE'S DATA. EVERY SINGLE ONE

03:45:40.827 --> 03:45:42.161
OF US, WHETHER IT'S GENDER

03:45:42.228 --> 03:45:43.096
AFFIRMING CARE, WHETHER IT'S

03:45:43.162 --> 03:45:44.664
WHETHER IT'S ANY CARE THAT WE

03:45:44.731 --> 03:45:46.499
GET WHATEVER IS PRESCRIBED TO

03:45:46.566 --> 03:45:48.635
US, WE DON'T EXPECT THAT TO BE

03:45:48.701 --> 03:45:51.905
MADE AVAILABLE TO SOMEONE WHO

03:45:51.971 --> 03:45:53.673
WANTS TO CREATE A LAW THAT

03:45:53.740 --> 03:45:54.941
CRIMINALIZES US OR OUR DOCTORS.

03:45:55.008 --> 03:45:56.109
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT

03:45:56.175 --> 03:46:00.179
NOW. AND IT'S TERRIFYING. AND

03:46:00.246 --> 03:46:01.147
FOR CALIFORNIA TO NOT HAVE

03:46:01.214 --> 03:46:03.416
ADEQUATE PROTECTIONS RIGHT NOW

03:46:03.483 --> 03:46:05.285
TO ENSURE THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE

03:46:05.351 --> 03:46:07.120
ACCESSING THAT CARE, WHEN THEY

03:46:07.186 --> 03:46:07.820
ARE GETTING THAT TREATMENT, THEY

03:46:07.887 --> 03:46:09.889
KNOW THAT IT'S PROTECTED, I

03:46:09.956 --> 03:46:11.591
THINK IS DANGEROUS IN THIS

03:46:11.658 --> 03:46:13.693
CLIMATE. AND SO I APPRECIATE THE

03:46:13.760 --> 03:46:15.595
LEADERSHIP IN COMING FORWARD AND

03:46:15.662 --> 03:46:17.830
MAKING SURE THAT IF THERE'S A

03:46:17.897 --> 03:46:18.831
COURT ORDER, IF THERE'S A

03:46:18.898 --> 03:46:20.466
SUBPOENA, THAT'S A DIFFERENT

03:46:20.533 --> 03:46:21.434
SITUATION. BUT SHARING THIS TYPE

03:46:21.501 --> 03:46:23.603
OF INFORMATION THAT CAN PUT

03:46:23.670 --> 03:46:25.405
PEOPLE AT RISK, THAT CAN

03:46:25.471 --> 03:46:26.506
CRIMINALIZE THEM SIMPLY FOR

03:46:26.572 --> 03:46:28.074
DOING THEIR JOB OR RECEIVING

03:46:28.141 --> 03:46:30.376
TREATMENT, I THINK IS INCREDIBLY

03:46:30.443 --> 03:46:32.512
DANGEROUS, AND ESPECIALLY RIGHT

03:46:32.578 --> 03:46:35.682
NOW AS IT RELATES TO PROTECTING

03:46:35.748 --> 03:46:38.584
TRANS PEOPLE, GENDER

03:46:38.651 --> 03:46:39.852
NONCONFORMING PEOPLE WHO ARE

03:46:39.919 --> 03:46:41.955
RECEIVING CARE. THIS IS

03:46:42.021 --> 03:46:42.588
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT PROTECTION.

03:46:42.655 --> 03:46:44.924
AND I'LL MOVE THE BILL. ALL

03:46:44.991 --> 03:46:45.725
RIGHT. BEFORE WE PROCEED, WE

03:46:45.792 --> 03:46:47.627
HAVE A MOTION. IS THERE A

03:46:47.694 --> 03:46:48.795
SECOND? WE HAVE A SECOND. BY

03:46:48.861 --> 03:46:50.563
NGUYEN. LET'S CONTINUE. OTHER

03:46:50.630 --> 03:46:51.397
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM

03:46:51.464 --> 03:46:54.467
COMMITTEE MEMBERS SEEING NONE.

03:46:54.534 --> 03:46:55.702
SENATOR WIENER, WOULD YOU LIKE

03:46:55.768 --> 03:46:57.537

03:47:03.543 --> 03:47:07.513
EXTENSIVELY ABOUT THE FASCISM

03:47:07.580 --> 03:47:08.982
ARISING IN THIS COUNTRY AND WHAT

03:47:09.048 --> 03:47:11.684
IT'S DOING IN TERMS OF ATTACKING

03:47:11.751 --> 03:47:13.886
AND TEARING APART IMMIGRANT

03:47:13.953 --> 03:47:16.022
COMMUNITIES. AND WE HAVE, AT THE

03:47:16.089 --> 03:47:18.391
SAME TIME, A BROAD BASED ATTACK

03:47:18.458 --> 03:47:20.126
ON THE VERY EXISTENCE OF

03:47:20.193 --> 03:47:22.662
TRANSGENDER PEOPLE. THIS BILL IS

03:47:22.729 --> 03:47:24.297
ABOUT CALIFORNIA STEPPING UP TO

03:47:24.364 --> 03:47:25.965
PROTECT THESE MEMBERS OF OUR

03:47:26.032 --> 03:47:27.166
COMMUNITY. AND I RESPECTFULLY

03:47:27.233 --> 03:47:28.768
ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. WELL, THANK

TALKING ALL DAY ABOUT

03:47:36.042 --> 03:47:36.542
ACCOUNTABILITY. SO LET ME BE

03:47:36.609 --> 03:47:38.544
CLEAR. MY NAME IS NICK SCHULTZ.

03:47:38.611 --> 03:47:40.313

03:48:12.345 --> 03:48:13.679
WILL PROBABLY BE OUR LAST ITEM

03:48:13.746 --> 03:48:15.848
BEFORE THE LUNCH BREAK. WE HAVE

03:48:15.915 --> 03:48:20.353
SENATE BILL FOUR. MARK. PARDON

03:48:20.420 --> 03:48:25.992
ME ONE MOMENT. SO, SENATOR

03:48:26.059 --> 03:48:27.293
RUBIO, WE PROBABLY ONLY HAVE

03:48:27.360 --> 03:48:28.895
TIME FOR ONE ITEM BEFORE LUNCH.

03:48:28.961 --> 03:48:30.430
WHICH BILL WOULD YOU LIKE TO

03:48:30.496 --> 03:48:32.765
START WITH? SB 680. OKAY,

03:48:32.832 --> 03:48:34.667
COLLEAGUES, THIS IS ITEM NUMBER

03:48:34.734 --> 03:48:36.803
18, SENATE BILL 680. SENATOR

03:48:36.869 --> 03:48:39.972
RUBIO, THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK

03:48:40.039 --> 03:48:42.175
YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY

03:48:42.241 --> 03:48:44.243
TO PRESENT BEFORE YOU TODAY. I'M

03:48:44.310 --> 03:48:47.947
HONORED TO PRESENT SB 680, WHICH

03:48:48.014 --> 03:48:49.048
STRENGTHENS CALIFORNIA'S SEX

03:48:49.115 --> 03:48:50.883
OFFENDER REGISTRATION LAWS TO

03:48:50.950 --> 03:48:52.518
BETTER PROTECT OUR GIRLS HERE IN

03:48:52.585 --> 03:48:55.388
OUR STATE, AND ESPECIALLY FROM

03:48:55.455 --> 03:48:56.989
EXPLOITATION. LET'S BE CLEAR

03:48:57.056 --> 03:48:59.158
THIS BILL DOES NOTHING MORE THAN

03:48:59.225 --> 03:49:01.027
PROTECT OUR DAUGHTERS, OUR

03:49:01.094 --> 03:49:02.428
NIECES, AND OUR UNDERAGE GIRLS

03:49:02.495 --> 03:49:04.630
HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

03:49:04.697 --> 03:49:05.565
WHO ARE LEFT BEHIND. UNDER

03:49:05.631 --> 03:49:07.433
CURRENT STATE LAW, CALIFORNIA

03:49:07.500 --> 03:49:09.869
LAW SENDS A TROUBLING MESSAGE IT

03:49:09.936 --> 03:49:11.471
REQUIRES SEX OFFENDERS TO

03:49:11.537 --> 03:49:13.539
REGISTER FOR SEX ACTS WITH A

03:49:13.606 --> 03:49:15.141
MINOR. HOWEVER, OUR YOUNG LADIES

03:49:15.208 --> 03:49:18.144
ARE LEFT OUT. SB 680 WILL CLOSE

03:49:18.211 --> 03:49:19.545
THIS SIGNIFICANT LOOPHOLE IN

03:49:19.612 --> 03:49:21.114
CALIFORNIA SEX OFFENDER

03:49:21.180 --> 03:49:22.448
REGISTRATION LAWS, AND I'LL TURN

03:49:22.515 --> 03:49:25.051
IT OVER EVENTUALLY TO MY WITNESS

03:49:25.118 --> 03:49:26.853
TO EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE. UNDER

03:49:26.919 --> 03:49:28.387
CURRENT LAW, IF AN ADULT IS MORE

03:49:28.454 --> 03:49:30.156
THAN TEN YEARS OLDER THAN A

03:49:30.223 --> 03:49:32.558
MINOR AND ENGAGES IN SEXUAL

03:49:32.625 --> 03:49:33.993
ACTS, THEY'RE AUTOMATICALLY

03:49:34.060 --> 03:49:36.329
REQUIRED TO REGISTER A TIER ONE

03:49:36.395 --> 03:49:39.165
SEX OFFENDERS REGISTRY. THAT IS

03:49:39.232 --> 03:49:40.600
THE LAW RIGHT NOW. SO WE'RE NOT

03:49:40.666 --> 03:49:42.401
TRYING TO CHANGE THE LAW. WE'RE

03:49:42.468 --> 03:49:43.703
JUST TRYING TO PROTECT OUR GIRLS

03:49:43.769 --> 03:49:45.138
WHO THROUGH LANGUAGE HAVE BEEN

03:49:45.204 --> 03:49:48.374
LEFT OUT OF THIS, THIS EQUATION,

03:49:48.441 --> 03:49:51.077
THIS INCONSISTENCY DOES NOT MAKE

03:49:51.144 --> 03:49:52.912
SENSE TO LEAVE YOUNG GIRLS OUT.

03:49:52.979 --> 03:49:54.113
THEY ALSO DESERVE THE FULL

03:49:54.180 --> 03:49:55.581
PROTECTION OF THE LAW. THIS IS

03:49:55.648 --> 03:49:58.017
ABOUT PROTECTING THE GIRLS AND

03:49:58.084 --> 03:49:59.619
MAKING SURE THAT WE HOLD

03:49:59.685 --> 03:50:00.586
ACCOUNTABLE THE REPEAT OFFENDERS

03:50:00.653 --> 03:50:02.455
THAT CONTINUE TO GO BACK TO

03:50:02.522 --> 03:50:04.891
VIOLATE OUR YOUNG LADIES AGAIN.

03:50:04.957 --> 03:50:06.659
THIS LAW IS ALREADY IN PLACE,

03:50:06.726 --> 03:50:09.262
BUT I'M SO UPSET THAT DOESN'T

03:50:09.328 --> 03:50:11.097
INCLUDE YOUNG LADIES. AND TODAY

03:50:11.164 --> 03:50:13.566
WITH ME, I HAVE HEIDI FELDSTEIN

03:50:13.633 --> 03:50:16.068
SOTO, THE 43RD LOS ANGELES CITY

03:50:16.135 --> 03:50:17.970
ATTORNEY, AND TARA HILLARD,

03:50:18.037 --> 03:50:19.705
PRESIDENT AND CEO OF FORGOTTEN

03:50:19.772 --> 03:50:21.674
CHILDREN, WHO WILL FURTHER

03:50:21.741 --> 03:50:22.542
EXPLAIN THIS DEFICIENCY. THANK

03:50:22.608 --> 03:50:26.646
YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD

03:50:26.712 --> 03:50:27.580
MORNING STILL. THANK YOU SO

03:50:27.647 --> 03:50:30.183
MUCH, CHAIR SCHULTZ. AND TO THE

03:50:30.249 --> 03:50:30.850
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR

03:50:30.917 --> 03:50:32.351
HEARING US. MY NAME IS HEIDI

03:50:32.418 --> 03:50:33.920
FELDSTEIN SOTO. I AM THE CITY

03:50:33.986 --> 03:50:35.588
ATTORNEY FOR THE CITY OF LOS

03:50:35.655 --> 03:50:37.657
ANGELES. I WILL GIVE YOU A

03:50:37.723 --> 03:50:38.891
LITTLE BRIEF HISTORY. THIS BILL

03:50:38.958 --> 03:50:41.294
LAST YEAR PASSED OUT OF THE

03:50:41.360 --> 03:50:43.496
SENATE, OVERWHELMINGLY CAME TO

03:50:43.563 --> 03:50:45.231
THIS HOUSE, PASSED OUT OF BOTH

03:50:45.298 --> 03:50:47.533
COMMITTEES IN THIS HOUSE, AND

03:50:47.600 --> 03:50:49.535
WAS HELD UP IN APPROPRIATIONS.

03:50:49.602 --> 03:50:51.537
SO IT NEVER MADE IT TO THE

03:50:51.604 --> 03:50:52.605
SENATE FLOOR. THE ONLY ELEMENT

03:50:52.672 --> 03:50:54.407
OF THE BILL THAT INVOLVED

03:50:54.473 --> 03:50:55.374
APPROPRIATIONS LAST YEAR WAS

03:50:55.441 --> 03:50:56.676
THAT THERE WAS A CONCERN THAT

03:50:56.742 --> 03:50:58.477
THE WAY THE BILL WAS DRAFTED, IT

03:50:58.544 --> 03:51:00.813
WOULD BE RETROACTIVE TO THE

03:51:00.880 --> 03:51:02.181
ORIGINS OF THE SEX OFFENDERS

03:51:02.248 --> 03:51:03.282
REGISTRY. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IT

03:51:03.349 --> 03:51:05.418
WOULD PICK UP A WHOLE LOT OF NEW

03:51:05.484 --> 03:51:07.420
OFFENDERS. SENATOR RUBIO TOOK AN

03:51:07.486 --> 03:51:08.387
AMENDMENT TO ELIMINATE THAT. IT

03:51:08.454 --> 03:51:10.389
IS CLEAR THAT THERE IS NO

03:51:10.456 --> 03:51:12.058
RETROACTIVE EFFECT, AND THERE

03:51:12.124 --> 03:51:14.493
SHOULD BE MINIMAL TO NO FISCAL

03:51:14.560 --> 03:51:16.596
IMPACT GOING FORWARD. UNDER

03:51:16.662 --> 03:51:20.433
CURRENT LAW, EVERY SEX OFFENSE

03:51:20.499 --> 03:51:23.402
AGAINST ANY MINOR, IF THE

03:51:23.469 --> 03:51:25.304
PERPETRATOR IS AT LEAST TEN

03:51:25.371 --> 03:51:27.840
YEARS OLDER THAN THE MINOR, IS

03:51:27.907 --> 03:51:28.774
AUTOMATICALLY REGISTERED AS A

03:51:28.841 --> 03:51:31.244
TIER ONE REGISTRY. EVERY SINGLE

03:51:31.310 --> 03:51:35.381
ONE, SAVE ONE UNLAWFUL STATUTE.

03:51:35.448 --> 03:51:36.782
UNLAWFUL SEXUAL INTERCOURSE,

03:51:36.849 --> 03:51:39.285
ALSO KNOWN AS STATUTORY RAPE.

03:51:39.352 --> 03:51:40.686
ALSO, I'VE HEARD IT CALLED

03:51:40.753 --> 03:51:42.355
PENILE VAGINAL INTERCOURSE. SO

03:51:42.421 --> 03:51:46.125
IF YOU'RE 14 TO 17 AS A FEMALE

03:51:46.192 --> 03:51:48.928
MINOR AND YOU ARE ABUSED BY

03:51:48.995 --> 03:51:50.329
SOMEONE AT LEAST TEN YEARS OLDER

03:51:50.396 --> 03:51:53.232
THAN YOU, THEY ARE NOT

03:51:53.299 --> 03:51:54.967
AUTOMATICALLY REGISTRABLE. THIS

03:51:55.034 --> 03:51:56.969
HAS GROWN OUT OF OUR WORK. MY

03:51:57.036 --> 03:51:58.738
OFFICE'S WORK ALONG THE FIGUEROA

03:51:58.804 --> 03:52:00.606
CORRIDOR. WE HAVE WORKED

03:52:00.673 --> 03:52:01.607
EXTENSIVELY, AND I DO WANT TO

03:52:01.674 --> 03:52:03.843
LET MISS HILLYARD SPEAK TO YOU

03:52:03.909 --> 03:52:05.578
DIRECTLY, BECAUSE SHE HAS LIFE

03:52:05.645 --> 03:52:06.679
EXPERIENCE AND WORKS WITH THESE

03:52:06.746 --> 03:52:09.515
GIRLS DIRECTLY, BUT WE ARE

03:52:09.582 --> 03:52:11.484
SENDING A MESSAGE TO OUR TEENAGE

03:52:11.550 --> 03:52:15.988
GIRLS THAT SOMEHOW IT IS OKAY

03:52:16.055 --> 03:52:17.757
FOR THEM TO BE ABUSED, AND THAT

03:52:17.823 --> 03:52:20.259
THAT PERSON WHO IS AT LEAST TEN

03:52:20.326 --> 03:52:23.229
YEARS OLDER THAN THEM, IS

03:52:23.296 --> 03:52:25.031
SOMEHOW NOT A REGISTRABLE

03:52:25.097 --> 03:52:26.799
OFFENDER. I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO

03:52:26.866 --> 03:52:28.567
FIX THIS AS A LOOPHOLE IN THE

03:52:28.634 --> 03:52:31.170
LAW FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS NOW,

03:52:31.237 --> 03:52:34.006
AND I DO VIEW IT AS A TECHNICAL

03:52:34.073 --> 03:52:35.808
CORRECTION. THERE IS NOTHING, NO

03:52:35.875 --> 03:52:37.343
NEW CRIME BEING CREATED. THERE

03:52:37.410 --> 03:52:40.112
IS NO EXTENSION OF ANY SENTENCE.

03:52:40.179 --> 03:52:41.847
IF YOU ENGAGE IN ORAL SEX,

03:52:41.914 --> 03:52:43.115
YOU'RE AUTOMATICALLY REGISTERED.

03:52:43.182 --> 03:52:45.484
IF YOU ENGAGE IN SEX, YOU'RE

03:52:45.551 --> 03:52:48.020
AUTOMATICALLY REGISTERED. MY

03:52:48.087 --> 03:52:49.021
PERSPECTIVE WOULD BE IF YOU

03:52:49.088 --> 03:52:52.992
ENGAGE IN. THE MISSIONARY

03:52:53.059 --> 03:52:53.793
POSITION, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO

03:52:53.859 --> 03:52:55.528
CALL IT. PENAL VAGINAL

03:52:55.594 --> 03:52:56.929
INTERCOURSE. YOU OUGHT TO BE

03:52:56.996 --> 03:52:58.497
AUTOMATICALLY REGISTERED TO THE

03:52:58.564 --> 03:53:00.099
SAME EXTENT AS EVERYBODY ELSE.

03:53:00.166 --> 03:53:01.233
IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE SEX

03:53:01.300 --> 03:53:03.502
OFFENDERS REGISTRY, REPEAL IT.

03:53:03.569 --> 03:53:06.272
BUT AS LONG AS IT IS THE LAW OF

03:53:06.339 --> 03:53:08.641
THIS STATE, IT OUGHT TO APPLY

03:53:08.708 --> 03:53:09.508
WITH EQUAL FORCE TO ALL OF OUR

03:53:09.575 --> 03:53:11.911
MINORS. THANK YOU. HI, MY NAME

03:53:11.977 --> 03:53:13.879
IS TARA HILLIARD AND I AM THE

03:53:13.946 --> 03:53:15.781
CEO OF FORGOTTEN CHILDREN, INC.

03:53:15.848 --> 03:53:17.483
WE ARE AN ANTI-TRAFFICKING

03:53:17.550 --> 03:53:19.085
ORGANIZATION BASED OUT OF LONG

03:53:19.151 --> 03:53:20.886
BEACH WITH A SAFE HOUSE IN SAN

03:53:20.953 --> 03:53:23.689
BERNARDINO. SO IT'S GREAT TO BE

03:53:23.756 --> 03:53:25.524
HERE TODAY. I COME FIRST WITH MY

03:53:25.591 --> 03:53:27.660
OWN PERSONAL TESTIMONY. I WAS 16

03:53:27.727 --> 03:53:29.428
YEARS OLD WHEN I WAS ENGAGED IN

03:53:29.495 --> 03:53:32.298
A UNHEALTHY RELATIONSHIP WITH A

03:53:32.365 --> 03:53:34.734
GENTLEMAN THAT WAS 25 YEARS OLD.

03:53:34.800 --> 03:53:37.303
LATER ON FOUND OUT HE WAS 26. AT

03:53:37.370 --> 03:53:39.505
THAT TIME, I HAD NO IDEA THAT

03:53:39.572 --> 03:53:42.007
THE RELATIONSHIP I WAS IN WAS

03:53:42.074 --> 03:53:43.175
UNHEALTHY AND THAT HE WAS A

03:53:43.242 --> 03:53:44.610
PREDATOR. UNFORTUNATELY, JUST

03:53:44.677 --> 03:53:46.178
LIKE MANY PREDATORS, HE PREYED

03:53:46.245 --> 03:53:48.514
ON MY VULNERABILITIES OF BEING A

03:53:48.581 --> 03:53:49.915
SURVIVOR OF CHILD SEXUAL

03:53:49.982 --> 03:53:51.751
EXPLOITATION AND ASSAULT. AND

03:53:51.817 --> 03:53:53.886
SO, YOU KNOW, I RESIDE IN SOUTH

03:53:53.953 --> 03:53:55.788
LA, GREW UP THERE. AND WHAT I'VE

03:53:55.855 --> 03:53:57.156
LEARNED IS THAT PREDATORS LOVE

03:53:57.223 --> 03:53:59.058
TO GO INTO VULNERABLE

03:53:59.125 --> 03:54:00.025
COMMUNITIES LOOKING FOR

03:54:00.092 --> 03:54:01.727
VULNERABLE YOUNG WOMEN. IN FACT,

03:54:01.794 --> 03:54:03.629
THAT IS THE ISSUE OF HUMAN

03:54:03.696 --> 03:54:05.131
TRAFFICKING. WHY I DECIDED THAT

03:54:05.197 --> 03:54:06.699
I WAS GOING TO TURN MY TRAUMA

03:54:06.766 --> 03:54:08.401
INTO SOMETHING THAT WAS MORE

03:54:08.467 --> 03:54:09.802
VICTORIOUS. AND SO I FIGHT FOR

03:54:09.869 --> 03:54:11.504
YOUNG WOMEN WHO DON'T HAVE A

03:54:11.570 --> 03:54:13.372
VOICE. AND I BELIEVE THAT WHEN

03:54:13.439 --> 03:54:15.508
THERE IS AN ABSENCE OF LAWS OR

03:54:15.574 --> 03:54:16.108
ACCOUNTABILITY, THEN PREDATORS

03:54:16.175 --> 03:54:18.377
CAN PREY AS MUCH AS THEY WANT

03:54:18.444 --> 03:54:20.513
TO. THERE IS NO LAW, THERE IS NO

03:54:20.579 --> 03:54:21.947
ACCOUNTABILITY, AND VICTIMS ARE

03:54:22.014 --> 03:54:23.516
FORCED TO HAVE TO LIVE WITH THIS

03:54:23.582 --> 03:54:25.117
EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND SO MY

03:54:25.184 --> 03:54:27.653
PRAYER IS THAT MORE YOUNG WOMEN

03:54:27.720 --> 03:54:30.189
LIKE MYSELF, WHO WERE VICTIMS OR

03:54:30.256 --> 03:54:32.425
VULNERABLE AT THE TIME, NOW HAVE

03:54:32.491 --> 03:54:34.360
A WAY THAT THEY CAN STAND UP

03:54:34.427 --> 03:54:35.728
BECAUSE THERE ARE LAWS THAT WILL

03:54:35.795 --> 03:54:37.563
PROTECT THEM. I BELIEVE IF A

03:54:37.630 --> 03:54:38.697
PREDATOR KNOWS HE HAS TO

03:54:38.764 --> 03:54:39.698
REGISTER, THEN MAYBE THAT WILL

03:54:39.765 --> 03:54:42.134
CURTAIL SOME OF HIS ACTIVITY. IF

03:54:42.201 --> 03:54:43.302
NOT, THEN MAYBE IT WILL GIVE THE

03:54:43.369 --> 03:54:45.337
YOUNG WOMAN A VOICE TO SPEAK UP

03:54:45.404 --> 03:54:46.672
AND SPEAK OUT AND BECOME BOLD

03:54:46.739 --> 03:54:48.741
AND COURAGEOUS. AND SO I STAND

03:54:48.808 --> 03:54:50.476
HERE TODAY AS A VOICE FOR THOSE

03:54:50.543 --> 03:54:52.578
WHO DON'T HAVE THE VOICE. WE SEE

03:54:52.645 --> 03:54:53.446
YOUNG WOMEN EVERY DAY BETWEEN

03:54:53.512 --> 03:54:56.482
THE AGES OF 18 AND 27, PREYED

03:54:56.549 --> 03:54:58.784
UPON BY OLDER MEN WHO FEEL LIKE

03:54:58.851 --> 03:55:00.586
THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO THEIR

03:55:00.653 --> 03:55:01.720
BODIES, AND YOUNG WOMEN WHO

03:55:01.787 --> 03:55:03.355

OPPOSITION TO SB 680. THERE ARE

03:56:52.898 --> 03:56:55.434
VERY MANY MOVING STORIES ON BOTH

03:56:55.501 --> 03:56:58.170
SIDES OF THE ISSUES IN THESE

03:56:58.237 --> 03:57:01.173
KINDS OF BILLS, AND I THANK YOU

03:57:04.043 --> 03:57:07.279
GOING TO BE TECHNICAL. SB 680

03:57:07.346 --> 03:57:08.981
WOULD DO THE FOLLOWING. IT WOULD

03:57:09.048 --> 03:57:12.551
UNDERMINE THE EVIDENCE BASED

03:57:12.618 --> 03:57:14.853
2017 SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY

03:57:14.920 --> 03:57:17.356
REFORM ACT, WHICH PURPOSEFULLY

03:57:17.423 --> 03:57:19.058
ELIMINATED THE THEN EXISTING

03:57:19.124 --> 03:57:21.293
OVERBROAD REGISTRATION

03:57:21.360 --> 03:57:22.561
REQUIREMENTS, THEREBY

03:57:22.628 --> 03:57:24.496
UNDERMINING THE CONSIDERABLE

03:57:24.563 --> 03:57:26.532
PROGRESS CALIFORNIA HAS MADE IN

03:57:26.599 --> 03:57:29.134
CATCHING UP WITH THE REST OF THE

03:57:29.201 --> 03:57:31.103
STATES AND THE FEDERAL

03:57:31.170 --> 03:57:36.442
GOVERNMENT. IN IN ITS APPROACH

03:57:36.508 --> 03:57:38.911
TO SEX OFFENDER REGISTRATION, IT

03:57:38.978 --> 03:57:40.679
WOULD CREATE COLLATERAL IMPACTS

03:57:40.746 --> 03:57:42.815
ON FAMILIES, CHILDREN, AND

03:57:42.881 --> 03:57:44.617
COMMUNITIES OF NON-DANGEROUS

03:57:44.683 --> 03:57:46.518
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO

03:57:46.585 --> 03:57:48.954
REGISTER IT WOULD ENSNARE

03:57:49.021 --> 03:57:51.023
OTHERWISE LAW ABIDING

03:57:51.090 --> 03:57:53.058
INDIVIDUALS FROM VISITING FROM

OHIO, WHERE THE AGE OF CONSENT

03:58:01.266 --> 03:58:04.436
IS 16 YEARS OLD. IT WOULD CREATE

03:58:04.503 --> 03:58:06.672
CRIMES OF MORAL TURPITUDE BY

03:58:06.739 --> 03:58:08.374
REQUIRING THE TEN YEAR

03:58:08.440 --> 03:58:10.209
REGISTRATION FOR PENAL CODE

03:58:10.275 --> 03:58:13.846

LEADING UNDER FEDERAL LAW TO

03:58:16.148 --> 03:58:18.117
DEPORTATION. IN OTHER WORDS, BY

03:58:18.183 --> 03:58:20.653
REQUIRING A NON-CITIZEN 21 YEAR

WITH THEIR 17 YEAR OLD LOVED ONE

03:58:25.624 --> 03:58:27.626
TO REGISTER AS A SEX OFFENDER

03:58:27.693 --> 03:58:28.727
FOR TEN YEARS, THIS BILL WOULD

03:58:28.794 --> 03:58:30.596
BE DEEMED A CRIME OF MORAL

03:58:30.663 --> 03:58:33.232
TURPITUDE AND LEAD TO LIKELY

03:58:33.298 --> 03:58:35.034
DEPORTATION. IN THESE DAYS.

03:58:35.100 --> 03:58:38.037
DEFINITE DEPORTATION. THIS BILL

03:58:38.103 --> 03:58:39.772
WOULD ENACT A REGISTRATION

03:58:39.838 --> 03:58:41.507
REQUIREMENT THAT IS UNNECESSARY

03:58:41.573 --> 03:58:44.043
AND REDUNDANT, SINCE A JUDGE CAN

03:58:44.109 --> 03:58:47.713
ORDER ANYONE CONVICTED OF ANY

03:58:47.780 --> 03:58:49.615

ASSAULT TO REGISTER. FOR THESE

03:59:12.504 --> 03:59:14.473
REASONS, WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST

03:59:14.540 --> 03:59:17.543
YOUR NO VOTE. STILL. MORNING.

03:59:17.609 --> 03:59:19.712
RIGHT. GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS

03:59:19.778 --> 03:59:21.146
ELIZABETH KIM. I'M THE POLICY

03:59:21.213 --> 03:59:23.348
DIRECTOR AT INITIATE JUSTICE. I

03:59:23.415 --> 03:59:25.551
COME TO THIS WORK AS A LAWYER, A

03:59:25.617 --> 03:59:27.252
FORMER POLICY STAFFER AT THE

03:59:27.319 --> 03:59:29.388
DOJ, AND AN EDUCATOR WHO HAS

03:59:29.455 --> 03:59:31.123
TAUGHT CIVIC ENGAGEMENT INSIDE

03:59:31.190 --> 03:59:33.459
LEVEL THREE AND FOUR PRISONS. I

03:59:33.525 --> 03:59:34.893
WORK DIRECTLY WITH PEOPLE

03:59:34.960 --> 03:59:36.061
IMPACTED BY THE JUSTICE SYSTEM,

03:59:36.128 --> 03:59:37.663
BOTH ON THE LAW ENFORCEMENT SIDE

03:59:37.730 --> 03:59:39.465
AS WELL AS PEOPLE WHO ARE

03:59:39.531 --> 03:59:42.101
IMPACTED. AND I'M HERE TODAY TO

03:59:42.167 --> 03:59:43.769
RESPECTFULLY URGE A NO VOTE ON

03:59:43.836 --> 03:59:46.371
SB 680. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO

03:59:46.438 --> 03:59:50.008
FOCUS ON TODAY IS THAT A COUPLE

03:59:50.075 --> 03:59:52.044
THINGS. MY COLLEAGUE HAS ALREADY

03:59:52.111 --> 03:59:53.378
ADDRESSED THE LEGAL OVERREACH

03:59:53.445 --> 03:59:55.280
AND THE IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES

03:59:55.347 --> 03:59:57.616
OF THIS BILL. AND WHAT I'D LIKE

03:59:57.683 --> 03:59:59.318
TO FOCUS ON IS THE PUBLIC

03:59:59.384 --> 04:00:00.385
SAFETY, THE REENTRY AND THE

04:00:00.452 --> 04:00:02.821
SYSTEM CAPACITY, BECAUSE THESE

04:00:02.888 --> 04:00:05.858
IMPACTS ARE REAL AND MEASURABLE.

04:00:05.924 --> 04:00:07.259
ALTHOUGH WE APPRECIATE THAT IT

04:00:07.326 --> 04:00:08.727
DOESN'T WORK RETROACTIVELY,

04:00:08.794 --> 04:00:10.162
WHICH WE APPRECIATE IN THE

04:00:10.229 --> 04:00:11.630
AMENDMENTS, THIS BILL WON'T MAKE

04:00:11.697 --> 04:00:13.899
US SAFER. THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE

04:00:13.966 --> 04:00:16.268
OF JUSTICE AND BUREAU OF JUSTICE

04:00:16.335 --> 04:00:18.337
STATISTICS HAVE CONSISTENTLY

04:00:18.403 --> 04:00:19.505
FOUND THAT INCREASING THE

04:00:19.571 --> 04:00:22.241
SEVERITY OF PUNISHMENT OR

04:00:22.307 --> 04:00:24.109
REGISTRY DOES NOT REDUCE CRIME

04:00:24.176 --> 04:00:26.678
OR PREVENT THE CRIME. SO WHAT

04:00:26.745 --> 04:00:30.282
WE'RE SAYING IS THE JUDICIAL

04:00:30.349 --> 04:00:31.784
DISCRETION EXISTS. THE PENAL

04:00:31.850 --> 04:00:35.387
CODE, SECTION 290 .006 ALREADY

04:00:35.454 --> 04:00:37.422
ALLOWS JUDGES TO REQUIRE THAT

04:00:37.489 --> 04:00:38.557
REGISTRATION WHEN SOMEONE POSES

04:00:38.624 --> 04:00:41.093
A RISK, AND THAT DISCRETION

04:00:41.160 --> 04:00:43.262
MATTERS. SO IT ALLOWS COURTS TO

04:00:43.328 --> 04:00:44.329
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN DANGEROUS

04:00:44.396 --> 04:00:45.664
CONDUCT AND CASES WHERE

04:00:45.731 --> 04:00:47.366
REGISTRATION IS EITHER NECESSARY

04:00:47.432 --> 04:00:49.768
OR PROPORTIONATE, AND REMOVING

04:00:49.835 --> 04:00:51.103
REMOVING THAT FLEXIBILITY

04:00:51.170 --> 04:00:52.371
UNDERMINES BOTH PUBLIC SAFETY

04:00:52.437 --> 04:00:55.107
AND FAIRNESS. AND WE ALSO ARE

04:00:55.174 --> 04:00:57.309
CONCERNED ABOUT THE CAPACITY. I

04:00:57.376 --> 04:00:59.511
KNOW THAT YOU SAID THAT THERE'S

04:00:59.578 --> 04:01:01.213
ZERO FISCAL IMPACT. THE

04:01:01.280 --> 04:01:02.648
CALIFORNIA DOJ HAS WARNED THAT

04:01:02.714 --> 04:01:04.183
EXPANDING THE REGISTRY IN THIS

04:01:04.249 --> 04:01:05.918
WAY WOULD OVERWHELM AN ALREADY

04:01:05.984 --> 04:01:07.452
STRAINED SYSTEM AND PULL

04:01:07.519 --> 04:01:10.455
RESOURCES AWAY FROM HIGHER

04:01:10.522 --> 04:01:12.558
PRIORITY HARM, AND THE

04:01:12.624 --> 04:01:14.493
COMMISSION ON STATE MANDATES HAS

04:01:14.560 --> 04:01:16.562
RULED THAT COSTS ARE NON

04:01:16.628 --> 04:01:17.663
REIMBURSABLE, LEAVING COUNTIES

04:01:17.729 --> 04:01:19.832
AND COURTS TO DEAL WITH THE

04:01:19.898 --> 04:01:22.301
BILL. WE SHOULD BE INVESTING IN

04:01:22.367 --> 04:01:24.169
RISK BASED TOOLS, SUPPORT

04:01:24.236 --> 04:01:27.039
SERVICES AND SURVIVOR CENTERED

04:01:27.105 --> 04:01:28.874
PRACTICES TO HELP PREVENT THESE

04:01:28.941 --> 04:01:30.375
TYPES OF CRIMES, NOT EXPANDING

04:01:30.442 --> 04:01:33.212
THE REGISTRY FOR LOW RISK CASES.

04:01:33.278 --> 04:01:36.081
SO SB 680 MOVES US BACKWARDS

04:01:36.148 --> 04:01:37.850
LEGALLY, FISCALLY AND IN TERMS

04:01:37.916 --> 04:01:39.718
OF SAFETY. SO ON BEHALF OF

04:01:39.785 --> 04:01:42.054
INITIATE JUSTICE, I URGE YOUR NO

04:01:42.120 --> 04:01:43.388

THE ACLU, CALIFORNIA ACTION AND

04:03:06.104 --> 04:03:09.341
STRONG OPPOSITION. OKAY, FINAL

04:03:09.408 --> 04:03:11.910

NONE, WE'LL TURN IT BACK TO THE

04:03:21.520 --> 04:03:22.621

04:03:25.223 --> 04:03:27.426
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS? SEEING

04:03:27.492 --> 04:03:28.794
NONE. SENATOR RUBIO, WOULD YOU

04:03:28.860 --> 04:03:30.429
LIKE TO PROVIDE A BRIEF CLOSING

04:03:30.495 --> 04:03:31.596
STATEMENT? YES. THANK YOU. I

04:03:31.663 --> 04:03:33.432
JUST LET ME JUST START BY

04:03:33.498 --> 04:03:33.966
ACKNOWLEDGING EVERYONE'S

04:03:34.032 --> 04:03:35.534
COMMENTS AND CONCERNS. BUT

04:03:35.600 --> 04:03:37.069
THERE'S SEVERAL THINGS THAT JUST

04:03:37.135 --> 04:03:38.804
BAFFLE ME. MOST OF YOU KNOW HOW

04:03:38.870 --> 04:03:40.505
HARD I WORK ON BEHALF OF

04:03:40.572 --> 04:03:41.440
VICTIMS. I'VE BEEN A VICTIMS

04:03:41.506 --> 04:03:43.608
ADVOCATE FOR A LONG TIME, AND,

04:03:43.675 --> 04:03:44.543
YOU KNOW, I FIND IT OFFENSIVE.

04:03:44.609 --> 04:03:46.244
I'M GOING TO SAY, FORGIVE ME FOR

04:03:46.311 --> 04:03:47.479
THOSE WHO KEEP SAYING IT OVER

04:03:47.546 --> 04:03:49.648
AND OVER AGAIN, THAT STRICTER

04:03:49.715 --> 04:03:50.582
PUNISHMENT AND PENALTIES DOES

04:03:50.649 --> 04:03:53.552
NOT MAKE IT SAFER. BUT THIS IS

04:03:53.618 --> 04:03:55.687
ABOUT JUSTICE FOR THOSE VICTIMS.

04:03:55.754 --> 04:03:58.156
IT'S ABOUT GIVING THESE

04:03:58.223 --> 04:03:59.858
INDIVIDUALS THEIR TIME IN COURT

04:03:59.925 --> 04:04:02.494
AND JUSTICE. I DID HEAR

04:04:02.561 --> 04:04:05.030
SOMETHING ABOUT THE OPPOSITION

04:04:05.097 --> 04:04:07.532
SAYING THAT WE MAY BE

04:04:07.599 --> 04:04:08.300
POTENTIALLY PUTTING PEOPLE THAT

04:04:08.367 --> 04:04:11.236
ARE NON-DANGEROUS IN HARM'S WAY.

04:04:11.303 --> 04:04:14.373
THIS IS ABOUT TEN YEARS APART.

04:04:14.439 --> 04:04:16.308
THIS IS ABOUT AN ADULT HAVING

04:04:16.375 --> 04:04:19.111
SEX WITH A MINOR THAT'S AT LEAST

04:04:19.177 --> 04:04:21.613
TEN YEARS OLDER. I HOPE ANYONE

04:04:21.680 --> 04:04:23.115
ON THIS DAIS DOESN'T THINK IT'S

04:04:23.181 --> 04:04:24.916
OKAY TO HAVE A 28 YEAR OLD

04:04:24.983 --> 04:04:28.186
HAVING SEX WITH SOMEONE THAT'S

04:04:28.253 --> 04:04:29.788
17 OR 25 WITH SOMEONE THAT'S,

04:04:29.855 --> 04:04:33.191
YOU KNOW, 14 THAT IS DANGEROUS.

04:04:33.258 --> 04:04:35.093
THAT IS DANGEROUS. SO SAYING

04:04:35.160 --> 04:04:37.062
THAT POTENTIALLY PUTTING PEOPLE

04:04:37.129 --> 04:04:39.264
IN JAIL OR HARM'S WAY BECAUSE,

04:04:39.331 --> 04:04:41.967
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE NOT DANGEROUS,

04:04:42.034 --> 04:04:43.502
IT IS DANGEROUS. SO I FIND THAT

04:04:43.568 --> 04:04:45.070
TO BE OFFENSIVE. AGAIN, THIS IS

04:04:45.137 --> 04:04:46.471
ABOUT JUSTICE FOR THOSE YOUNG

04:04:46.538 --> 04:04:47.739
LADIES WHO ARE HARMED. AND I

04:04:47.806 --> 04:04:49.341
KNOW THAT NO ONE HERE THINKS

04:04:49.408 --> 04:04:51.610
THAT IT IS OKAY TO HAVE SEX WITH

04:04:51.676 --> 04:04:53.445
A MINOR WHEN YOU'RE MORE THAN

04:04:53.512 --> 04:04:54.780
TEN YEARS OLDER THAN THAT MINOR,

04:04:54.846 --> 04:04:56.882
AND THINK THAT THAT CHILD

04:04:56.948 --> 04:04:58.617
CONSENTED AND HAD THE EXPERTISE,

04:04:58.683 --> 04:05:01.553
THE KNOW HOW, AND THE MATURITY

04:05:01.620 --> 04:05:03.688
TO CONSENT. SO WITH THAT, I

04:05:03.755 --> 04:05:04.956
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN EVIL.

04:05:05.023 --> 04:05:05.724
WELL, THANK YOU, SENATOR RUBIO,

04:05:05.791 --> 04:05:07.292
VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION

04:05:07.359 --> 04:05:09.127
TODAY. COLLEAGUES, I AM

04:05:09.194 --> 04:05:11.830
RECOMMENDING AN AYE. I, I AGREE

04:05:11.897 --> 04:05:13.532
WITH THE SENATOR. I THINK THAT

04:05:13.598 --> 04:05:14.966
THE FACT PATTERN THAT SHE JUST

04:05:15.033 --> 04:05:16.601
SET FORTH, I THINK WE WOULD ALL

04:05:16.668 --> 04:05:17.669
AGREE, IS COMPLETELY

04:05:17.736 --> 04:05:18.637
UNACCEPTABLE AND SHOULD BE

04:05:18.703 --> 04:05:19.771
GUARDED AGAINST. I ACKNOWLEDGE

04:05:19.838 --> 04:05:20.705
FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT THERE

04:05:20.772 --> 04:05:22.474
ARE LEGITIMATE QUESTIONS ABOUT

04:05:22.541 --> 04:05:23.875
ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES, BUT

04:05:23.942 --> 04:05:24.609
RESPECTFULLY, THOSE ARE BEYOND

04:05:24.676 --> 04:05:25.744
THE PURVIEW OF THIS COMMITTEE.

04:05:25.811 --> 04:05:27.512
AS A MATTER OF POLICY, I FIND IT

04:05:27.579 --> 04:05:29.414
TO BE APPROPRIATE. I AM

04:05:29.481 --> 04:05:30.782
RECOMMENDING AN AYE, LET'S CALL

04:05:30.849 --> 04:05:33.718

OKAY. THAT MEASURE REMAINS ON

04:05:52.904 --> 04:05:54.573
CALL. WE'LL LET YOU KNOW THE

04:05:54.639 --> 04:05:55.373
OUTCOME. WE'LL GET SOME ABSENT

04:06:00.345 --> 04:06:00.879
NOW, WE'LL RECONVENE AT 1:30

04:06:00.946 --> 04:06:02.514
P.M. I'M JUST GOING TO NOTE THAT

04:06:02.581 --> 04:06:04.216
IF SENATOR RUBIO IS HERE, WE

04:06:04.282 --> 04:06:06.218
WILL START WITH HER. IF YOU ARE

04:06:06.284 --> 04:06:06.785
STAFF WATCHING, THE NEXT IN

04:06:06.852 --> 04:06:08.620
ORDER WOULD BE SENATORS DURAZZO.

04:06:08.687 --> 04:06:11.123
OH, SORRY. SENATOR HURTADO

THEY CAN ALL BE HERE CLOSE TO

04:06:15.227 --> 04:06:17.496
130 OR 145, THAT WOULD BE IDEAL.

04:06:17.562 --> 04:06:36.081
WE STAND IN RECESS ALSO.

06:09:07.391 --> 06:09:21.072
OH, SORRY. OKAY.

06:09:21.138 --> 06:09:24.575
I HIT GOBLIN. ALL RIGHT, WE'RE

06:09:24.642 --> 06:09:26.377
BACK FROM RECESS AND WE'RE GOING

06:09:26.444 --> 06:09:35.019
TO START WITH SENATOR HURTADO.

06:09:35.086 --> 06:09:41.592
SB 763. YES. ITEM 21. FLOOR IS

06:09:41.659 --> 06:09:57.708
YOURS. OKAY.

06:09:57.775 --> 06:10:02.280
I GOT HIM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

06:10:02.346 --> 06:10:05.750
GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M HERE TO

06:10:05.816 --> 06:10:09.921
PRESENT SB 763, WHICH INCREASES

06:10:09.987 --> 06:10:11.489
PENALTIES UNDER THE CARTWRIGHT

06:10:11.556 --> 06:10:13.257
ACT, OUR STATE'S PRIMARY

06:10:13.324 --> 06:10:14.926
ANTITRUST LAW, WHICH HAS NOT

06:10:14.992 --> 06:10:17.962
BEEN MEANINGFULLY UPDATED IN

06:10:18.029 --> 06:10:20.831
DECADES. SB 763 UPDATES

06:10:20.898 --> 06:10:21.999
PENALTIES UNDER THE CARTWRIGHT

06:10:22.066 --> 06:10:24.168
ACT. SO THEY ACTUALLY MEAN

06:10:24.235 --> 06:10:26.504
SOMETHING IN TODAY'S ECONOMIC

06:10:26.571 --> 06:10:28.639
REALITY. WE'RE NOT PROPOSING ANY

06:10:28.706 --> 06:10:30.141
PHOENIX TRÊN. WE'RE SIMPLY

06:10:30.207 --> 06:10:31.876
ENSURING THAT VIOLATING OUR

06:10:31.943 --> 06:10:34.779
ANTITRUST LAWS COMES WITH REAL,

06:10:34.845 --> 06:10:38.049
ENFORCEABLE CONSEQUENCES.

06:10:38.115 --> 06:10:39.450
CONSEQUENCES BIG ENOUGH TO MAKE

06:10:39.517 --> 06:10:41.185
DOMINANT FIRMS AND INDIVIDUALS

06:10:41.252 --> 06:10:43.087
THINK TWICE BEFORE THEY RIG THE

06:10:43.154 --> 06:10:46.357
MARKET. SB 763 RAISES THE STAKES

06:10:46.424 --> 06:10:48.526
NOT TO PUNISH, BUT TO DETER,

06:10:48.593 --> 06:10:50.194
BECAUSE WHEN THERE'S NO REAL

06:10:50.261 --> 06:10:51.963
PENALTY, THERE'S NO REAL REASON

06:10:52.029 --> 06:10:53.864
TO STOP. AND WHEN BAD ACTORS

06:10:53.931 --> 06:10:56.300
DON'T STOP, WE ALL ULTIMATELY

06:10:56.367 --> 06:10:58.669
PAY THE PRICE AT THE GROCERY

06:10:58.736 --> 06:11:00.371
STORE, AT THE GAS PUMP, IN OUR

06:11:00.438 --> 06:11:01.872
RENT, AND IN THE BUSINESSES THAT

06:11:01.939 --> 06:11:03.941
ARE CHEATED FROM A FAIR

06:11:04.008 --> 06:11:06.544
OPPORTUNITY IN THE MARKET. THIS

06:11:06.611 --> 06:11:08.412
BILL ISN'T JUST ABOUT TAKING ON

06:11:08.479 --> 06:11:09.580
MONOPOLIES OR GLOBAL GIANTS.

06:11:09.647 --> 06:11:11.282
IT'S ABOUT STOPPING BIG PLAYERS

06:11:11.349 --> 06:11:14.752
WHO USE POWER, NOT INNOVATION,

06:11:14.819 --> 06:11:17.121
TO LOCK OTHERS OUT. WHETHER IT'S

06:11:17.188 --> 06:11:18.823
A CORPORATE CHAIN PUSHING OUT

06:11:18.889 --> 06:11:20.391
LOCAL STORES OR A DOMINANT

06:11:20.458 --> 06:11:22.760
SUPPLIER, SETTING PRICES IN A

06:11:22.827 --> 06:11:25.496
CLOSED MARKET, THE STORY IS THE

06:11:25.563 --> 06:11:27.999
SAME RIG THE SYSTEM, BLOCK THE

06:11:28.065 --> 06:11:29.734
COMPETITION AND MAKE EVERYONE

06:11:29.800 --> 06:11:32.737
ELSE PAY. SB 763 IS ABOUT

06:11:32.803 --> 06:11:35.306
STANDING UP FOR PEOPLE, FOR THE

06:11:35.373 --> 06:11:37.141
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WHO WE KNOW

06:11:37.208 --> 06:11:39.176
ARE SUFFERING. WHILE MAJOR

06:11:39.243 --> 06:11:40.578
CORPORATIONS RAKE IN RECORD

06:11:40.645 --> 06:11:43.547
PROFITS, CALIFORNIANS DESERVE A

06:11:43.614 --> 06:11:46.083
COMPETITIVE ECONOMY THAT WORKS

06:11:46.150 --> 06:11:49.286
FOR EVERYONE. IT'S ABOUT

06:11:49.353 --> 06:11:50.755
ENSURING THAT THE LAW PROTECTS

06:11:50.821 --> 06:11:52.657
THE MANY AND DOESN'T JUST FAVOR

06:11:52.723 --> 06:11:56.227
THE FEW. THANK YOU. I

06:11:56.293 --> 06:11:58.195
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE

06:11:58.262 --> 06:11:59.764

SO ONE EXAMPLE IS A FORMER

06:12:56.487 --> 06:12:57.555

06:13:10.634 --> 06:13:11.368
BRIBES AND WAS ULTIMATELY

06:13:11.435 --> 06:13:13.104
SENTENCED TO OVER FOUR YEARS IN

06:13:13.170 --> 06:13:15.406
JAIL AND FINED ALMOST $1

06:13:15.473 --> 06:13:17.074
MILLION. ONE OF THE OTHER

06:13:17.141 --> 06:13:18.042
CONSPIRATORS RECEIVED A SENTENCE

06:13:18.109 --> 06:13:19.643
JUST UNDER FOUR YEARS, AND WAS

06:13:19.710 --> 06:13:22.379
ORDERED TO PAY $800,000 IN

06:13:22.446 --> 06:13:24.148
RESTITUTION. ANOTHER CONSPIRATOR

06:13:24.215 --> 06:13:25.583
WAS SENTENCED TO SIX AND A HALF

06:13:25.649 --> 06:13:27.518
YEARS IN JAIL, AND ORDERED TO

06:13:27.585 --> 06:13:29.286
PAY NEARLY 1 MILLION IN

06:13:29.353 --> 06:13:30.554
RESTITUTION. THE VICTIMS IN

06:13:30.621 --> 06:13:33.190
THESE CASES WERE THE CALIFORNIA

06:13:33.257 --> 06:13:35.426
TAXPAYERS WHO OVERPAID FOR THE

06:13:35.493 --> 06:13:37.228
CONTRACTS, AS WELL AS THE LAW

06:13:37.294 --> 06:13:39.029
ABIDING BUSINESSES WHO COMPETED

06:13:39.096 --> 06:13:40.765
HONESTLY BUT WERE DENIED THE

06:13:40.831 --> 06:13:41.932
CONTRACTS DUE TO THE BID

06:13:41.999 --> 06:13:44.835
RIGGING. IN ANOTHER CASE, THIS

06:13:44.902 --> 06:13:46.937
ONE WAS IN NEVADA. AN OWNER OF A

06:13:47.004 --> 06:13:48.706
HEALTHCARE STAFFING COMPANY

06:13:48.773 --> 06:13:50.107
CONSPIRED WITH OTHER COMPANIES

06:13:50.174 --> 06:13:52.409
TO FIX THE WAGES FOR NURSES. TO

06:13:52.476 --> 06:13:54.145
QUOTE THE INDICTMENT, THEY SENT

06:13:54.211 --> 06:13:56.313
TEXT MESSAGES EXPLICITLY SAYING,

06:13:56.380 --> 06:13:58.249
WE ALL HAVE A MUTUAL AGREEMENT

06:13:58.315 --> 06:13:59.917
THAT ALL THREE COMPANIES WILL

06:13:59.984 --> 06:14:01.719
STAY WITHIN THE SAME HOURLY

06:14:01.786 --> 06:14:03.888
RATE, FIXING PRICES, WHETHER

06:14:03.954 --> 06:14:05.890
THEIR PRICES FOR GOODS OR PRICES

06:14:05.956 --> 06:14:07.691
FOR WAGES, AGAIN, ARE CORE

06:14:07.758 --> 06:14:10.194
ANTITRUST CRIMES. THE INDICTMENT

06:14:10.261 --> 06:14:12.496
IN THAT CASE REQUESTS CRIMINAL

06:14:12.563 --> 06:14:14.965
FORFEITURE OF OVER 12.5 MILLION.

06:14:15.032 --> 06:14:17.067
SO WHY AM I TELLING YOU ABOUT

06:14:17.134 --> 06:14:19.436
THESE CASES? WHY DO WE EVEN NEED

06:14:19.503 --> 06:14:20.538
THIS BILL IF WE CAN ALREADY GET

06:14:20.604 --> 06:14:22.273
THESE SENTENCES AND FINES?

06:14:22.339 --> 06:14:24.408
BECAUSE THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY

06:14:24.475 --> 06:14:25.509
GENERAL'S OFFICE DIDN'T BRING

06:14:25.576 --> 06:14:28.579
THESE CASES. THESE ARE U.S.

06:14:28.646 --> 06:14:30.414
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

06:14:30.481 --> 06:14:31.982
PROSECUTIONS. WE HAVE NOT

06:14:32.049 --> 06:14:33.384
BROUGHT A CALIFORNIA STATE

06:14:33.450 --> 06:14:35.419
CRIMINAL ANTITRUST CASE IN 30

06:14:35.486 --> 06:14:37.688
YEARS, BECAUSE WE HAVE

06:14:37.755 --> 06:14:39.557
COMPLETELY ABDICATED, AND WE

06:14:39.623 --> 06:14:41.625
COMPLETELY RELY ON THE FEDERAL

06:14:41.692 --> 06:14:44.161
GOVERNMENT TO BRING THESE CASES.

06:14:44.228 --> 06:14:46.363
LET ME BE CLEAR, AND I'M ONE OF

06:14:46.430 --> 06:14:48.833
THE FEW PEOPLE WHO WILL SAY THIS

06:14:48.899 --> 06:14:50.201
TODAY, HAVING LISTENED TO THE

06:14:50.267 --> 06:14:51.068
TESTIMONY THIS MORNING, EVEN

06:14:51.135 --> 06:14:52.469
RIGHT NOW UNDER THE TRUMP

06:14:52.536 --> 06:14:53.470
ADMINISTRATION, THIS U.S.

06:14:53.537 --> 06:14:55.339
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, THEY HAVE

06:14:55.406 --> 06:14:57.007
GOOD ANTITRUST PROSECUTORS, AND

06:14:57.074 --> 06:14:58.542
THEY ARE GOOD COLLEAGUES OF

06:14:58.609 --> 06:15:02.346
MINE. BUT THEY CAN CHANGE THEIR

06:15:02.413 --> 06:15:04.682
MINDS. THEY CAN DECIDE TO HAVE

06:15:04.748 --> 06:15:06.884
DIFFERENT PRIORITIES. THEY CAN

06:15:06.951 --> 06:15:08.619
DECIDE THAT IMMIGRATION IS MORE

06:15:08.686 --> 06:15:09.987
IMPORTANT. THEY CAN DECIDE THAT

06:15:10.054 --> 06:15:11.922
FLORIDA AND TEXAS ANTITRUST IS

06:15:11.989 --> 06:15:13.958
MORE IMPORTANT THAN PROTECTING

06:15:14.024 --> 06:15:16.927
CALIFORNIA PROCUREMENTS. THE US

06:15:16.994 --> 06:15:19.363
DOJ OBVIOUSLY SETS ITS OWN

06:15:19.430 --> 06:15:21.465
PRIORITIES. CRIMINAL ANTITRUST,

06:15:21.532 --> 06:15:23.334
WHICH IS FOCUSED ON WHITE COLLAR

06:15:23.400 --> 06:15:24.869
CRIME, IS ABOUT DETERRENCE. AND

06:15:24.935 --> 06:15:25.903
I'VE HEARD MANY WITNESSES ALSO

06:15:25.970 --> 06:15:28.072
SAY THAT LONGER SENTENCES ARE

06:15:28.138 --> 06:15:30.875
NOT EFFECTIVE. THEY ARE IN THESE

06:15:30.941 --> 06:15:32.776
TYPES OF WHITE COLLAR CRIMES.

06:15:32.843 --> 06:15:35.646
THESE ARE WHITE COLLAR. THE

06:15:35.713 --> 06:15:38.148
TRADITIONAL WHITE COLLAR

06:15:38.215 --> 06:15:40.284
DEFENDANT HAS $1 MILLION COMPANY

06:15:40.351 --> 06:15:41.585
IS BIDDING ON MILLION DOLLAR

06:15:41.652 --> 06:15:42.887
CONTRACTS. AND WHAT WE ARE

06:15:42.953 --> 06:15:44.421
TRYING TO DO IS A COUPLE OF

06:15:44.488 --> 06:15:46.423
PROCUREMENTS A YEAR TO KEEP THEM

06:15:46.490 --> 06:15:47.791
FROM, TO SEND THE MESSAGE THAT

06:15:47.858 --> 06:15:49.159
YOU CANNOT STEP OVER THAT LINE,

06:15:49.226 --> 06:15:51.562
YOU CANNOT BE TEMPTED. THE U.S.

06:15:51.629 --> 06:15:52.897
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE OVER THE

06:15:52.963 --> 06:15:55.366
ENTIRE COUNTRY BRINGS AN AVERAGE

06:15:55.432 --> 06:15:58.369
OF 27 CASES A YEAR. NEW YORK AS

06:15:58.435 --> 06:16:00.137
ANOTHER EXAMPLE, A STATE EXAMPLE

06:16:00.204 --> 06:16:01.772
BRINGS SLIGHTLY LESS THAN ONE.

06:16:01.839 --> 06:16:03.807
THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL

06:16:03.874 --> 06:16:06.277
WOULD PROBABLY BRING 1 TO 3

06:16:06.343 --> 06:16:09.680
CASES A YEAR. WE ARE NOT GOING

06:16:09.747 --> 06:16:11.015
TO FLOOD THE JAILS. ONE OF THE

06:16:11.081 --> 06:16:12.416
REASONS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS NOT

06:16:12.483 --> 06:16:14.285
BROUGHT CRIMINAL ANTITRUST CASES

06:16:14.351 --> 06:16:17.021
IS THAT OUR FINES AND JAIL TIME

06:16:17.087 --> 06:16:19.957
ARE SO MUCH LOWER THAN WHAT THE

06:16:20.024 --> 06:16:21.492
FEDS CAN ACHIEVE. THE SENTENCES

06:16:21.558 --> 06:16:22.860
I JUST READ YOU FOR THOSE

06:16:22.927 --> 06:16:24.361
CALTRANS THINGS. I CAN'T GET

06:16:24.428 --> 06:16:25.629
THOSE UNDER CALIFORNIA STATE

06:16:25.696 --> 06:16:28.265
LAW. SO AS A PROSECUTOR, I LOOK

06:16:28.332 --> 06:16:30.467
AT A CASE AND I HAVE TO DEFER TO

06:16:30.534 --> 06:16:32.202
THE FEDS BECAUSE THEY HAVE MUCH

06:16:32.269 --> 06:16:35.372
HIGHER PENALTIES FOR CRIMINALS.

06:16:35.439 --> 06:16:37.041
SO WITH THAT, I THANK YOU VERY

06:16:37.107 --> 06:16:38.375
MUCH FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY,

06:16:38.442 --> 06:16:40.544
AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO

06:16:40.611 --> 06:16:43.280
SUPPORT SB 763 AND PROVIDE A

06:16:43.347 --> 06:16:45.149
LONG OVERDUE UPDATE TO THE

06:16:45.215 --> 06:16:46.517
ANTITRUST PENALTIES UNDER THE

06:16:46.583 --> 06:16:48.752
CARTWRIGHT ACT. THANK YOU, THANK

06:16:48.819 --> 06:16:49.620
YOU, THANK YOU FOR YOUR

06:16:49.687 --> 06:16:50.521
TESTIMONY. I'M SURE SOME OTHERS

06:16:50.587 --> 06:16:52.456
ARE GOING TO BE USING YOU NOW ON

06:16:52.523 --> 06:16:54.425
THEIR TESTIMONIES WITH WHAT YOU

06:16:54.491 --> 06:16:56.393
JUST SAID. ANYONE ELSE IN

06:16:56.460 --> 06:17:00.197

START WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK

COMMITTEE MEMBERS, THE

06:17:42.506 --> 06:17:43.741
AMENDMENTS THAT THE SENATE

06:17:43.807 --> 06:17:45.109
APPROPRIATIONS PUT INTO THE BILL

06:17:45.175 --> 06:17:47.378
WE HAVE REMOVED. SORRY. BÀN

06:17:47.444 --> 06:17:49.513
CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.

06:17:49.580 --> 06:17:51.382
WE HAVE REMOVED THE COST DRIVER

06:17:51.448 --> 06:17:52.750
LABEL FROM THE BILL. HOWEVER, WE

06:17:52.816 --> 06:17:55.119
MUST REMAIN OPPOSED. WE BELIEVE

06:17:55.185 --> 06:17:57.021
THAT THIS BILL IS PREMATURE, AS

06:17:57.087 --> 06:17:58.989
THE CALIFORNIA LAW REVISION

06:17:59.056 --> 06:18:00.290
COMMISSION IS IN THE FINAL

06:18:00.357 --> 06:18:01.892
STAGES OF COMPLETING A MULTIYEAR

06:18:01.959 --> 06:18:03.694
STUDY OF THE STATE'S ANTITRUST

06:18:03.761 --> 06:18:05.763
LAWS. WE ARE EXPECTING THOSE

06:18:05.829 --> 06:18:06.463
RECOMMENDATIONS AT THE END OF

06:18:06.530 --> 06:18:08.699
THIS CALENDAR YEAR, AND THEN

06:18:08.766 --> 06:18:10.134
SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATION RELATED

06:18:10.200 --> 06:18:12.169
TO THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS NEXT

06:18:12.236 --> 06:18:14.805
YEAR, DRAMATICALLY EXPANDING THE

06:18:14.872 --> 06:18:16.206
ASSOCIATED PENALTIES BEFORE THIS

06:18:16.273 --> 06:18:18.308
REPORT IS COMPLETE AND THE

06:18:18.375 --> 06:18:20.411
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE IN PLACE, IS

06:18:20.477 --> 06:18:21.345
LITERALLY THE DEFINITION OF

06:18:21.412 --> 06:18:22.479
PUTTING THE CART BEFORE THE

06:18:22.546 --> 06:18:24.181

06:18:24.248 --> 06:18:26.216
THEREFORE, WE MUST RESPECTFULLY

06:18:26.283 --> 06:18:30.254
REMAIN OPPOSED TO SB 763. MR.

SHARE THE SAME CONCERNS THAT MR.

06:18:39.229 --> 06:18:42.533
HOLLENBECK JUST OUTLINED. WE

06:18:42.599 --> 06:18:44.234
THINK THAT THE CALIFORNIA LAW

06:18:44.301 --> 06:18:46.103
REVISION COMMISSION PROCESS

06:18:46.170 --> 06:18:49.006
SHOULD DEFINITELY PLAY OUT. I

06:18:49.073 --> 06:18:50.340
KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME

06:18:50.407 --> 06:18:53.644
COMPARISON BETWEEN THE FEDERAL

06:18:53.710 --> 06:18:55.079
ANTITRUST ACT AS WELL AS THE

06:18:55.145 --> 06:18:56.914
STATE. I'VE POINTED OUT, AS I

06:18:56.980 --> 06:18:58.715
HAVE IN PREVIOUS COMMITTEES ON

06:18:58.782 --> 06:19:01.151
THIS BILL, THAT THE CALIFORNIA

06:19:01.218 --> 06:19:03.821
SUPREME COURT HAS OPINED THAT

06:19:03.887 --> 06:19:05.556
CALIFORNIA'S CARTWRIGHT ACT IS

06:19:05.622 --> 06:19:07.324
BROADER IN RANGE AND DEEPER IN

06:19:07.391 --> 06:19:09.460
REACH THAN THE FEDERAL SHERMAN

06:19:09.526 --> 06:19:11.962
ANTITRUST ACT. I WOULD ALSO LIKE

06:19:12.029 --> 06:19:13.730
TO REMIND YOU THAT ON THE CIVIL

06:19:13.797 --> 06:19:15.866
SIDE, THERE ARE TREBLE DAMAGES,

06:19:15.933 --> 06:19:17.768
ATTORNEY'S FEES AND COSTS FOR

06:19:17.835 --> 06:19:18.769

IMPRISONMENT AND HEAVY CRIMINAL

PENALTIES ARE AVAILABLE. AND SO

06:19:26.410 --> 06:19:27.978
FOR THOSE REASONS, WE REMAIN IN

BENDING CHURROS AND FRESCAS FOR

06:27:49.212 --> 06:27:50.880
OVER TWO YEARS. I'M ALSO A DACA

06:27:50.947 --> 06:27:52.215
RECIPIENT. I'M A UC DAVIS

06:27:52.282 --> 06:27:53.383
GRADUATE. I'M CURRENTLY STUDYING

06:27:53.450 --> 06:27:55.619
TO TAKE THE LSAT. I HAVE THREE

06:27:55.685 --> 06:27:56.753
CHILDREN, A TWO YEAR OLD, A

06:27:56.820 --> 06:27:58.555
THREE YEAR OLD, AND A NINE YEAR

06:27:58.622 --> 06:28:00.724
OLD. STREET VENDING HAS GIVEN ME

06:28:00.790 --> 06:28:01.257
FINANCIAL FREEDOM AND HAS

06:28:01.324 --> 06:28:02.759
ALLOWED ME TO SUPPORT MY FAMILY

06:28:02.826 --> 06:28:04.561
AND ME. BUT TODAY, THERE IS AN

06:28:04.628 --> 06:28:06.062
IMMINENT THREAT THAT COULD

06:28:06.129 --> 06:28:07.631
JEOPARDIZE OUR FUTURE. THIS IS

06:28:07.697 --> 06:28:08.732
BECAUSE IN SOME CITIES, STREET

06:28:08.798 --> 06:28:09.332
VENDING LIKE MYSELF, JUMPED

06:28:09.399 --> 06:28:10.567
THROUGH NUMEROUS UNJUSTIFIABLE

06:28:10.634 --> 06:28:11.768
LOOPS AND BARRIERS JUST TO

06:28:11.835 --> 06:28:13.269
OBTAIN A PERMIT. FOR EXAMPLE,

06:28:13.336 --> 06:28:14.971
THEY REQUIRE THE EXCLUSIVE

06:28:15.038 --> 06:28:16.706
DISCLOSURE OF SENSITIVE

06:28:16.773 --> 06:28:17.340
INFORMATION. THESE BARRIERS ARE

06:28:17.407 --> 06:28:18.675
NEVER PLACED IN FRONT OF ANY

06:28:18.742 --> 06:28:19.976
OTHER ENTREPRENEURS WHO START

06:28:20.043 --> 06:28:22.145
THEIR OWN BUSINESSES. THE EXTRA

06:28:22.212 --> 06:28:23.246
BURDEN AND FEAR DETER PEOPLE

06:28:23.313 --> 06:28:25.015
FROM APPLYING FOR THE VENDING

06:28:25.081 --> 06:28:26.850
LICENSE. THIS PROCESS IS ALSO A

06:28:26.916 --> 06:28:28.952
DOUBLE EDGED SWORD BECAUSE IF WE

06:28:29.019 --> 06:28:30.353
DO NOT APPLY FOR THE LICENSE,

06:28:30.420 --> 06:28:31.354
THE CITY WILL NOT STOP CITING

06:28:31.421 --> 06:28:33.356
AND HARASSING US. BUT IF WE DO

06:28:33.423 --> 06:28:34.624
APPLY, WE COULD BE SEPARATED

06:28:34.691 --> 06:28:35.759
FROM OUR FAMILIES. IF OUR

06:28:35.825 --> 06:28:36.926
INFORMATION GETS SHARED WITH

06:28:36.993 --> 06:28:38.728
ICE. THESE DOUBLE STANDARD

06:28:38.795 --> 06:28:39.696
REQUIREMENTS FOR VENDORS ARE

06:28:39.763 --> 06:28:41.231
JUST ONE OF THE MANY WAYS THAT

06:28:41.297 --> 06:28:43.033
OUR LAWS TRY TO SUPPRESS

06:28:43.099 --> 06:28:44.934
ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY FOR

06:28:45.001 --> 06:28:45.835
IMMIGRANTS, ESPECIALLY LOW

06:28:45.902 --> 06:28:49.773
INCOME PEOPLE OF COLOR. ONE OF

06:28:49.839 --> 06:28:51.007
THE REASONS MANY CITIES REQUIRE

06:28:51.074 --> 06:28:52.308
THESE EXTRA STEPS IS BECAUSE

06:28:52.375 --> 06:28:54.010
CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS HAVE SO

06:28:54.077 --> 06:28:55.478
MUCH MISINFORMATION ABOUT STREET

06:28:55.545 --> 06:28:57.080
VENDORS. ALSO, BECAUSE MANY

06:28:57.147 --> 06:28:58.014
POWERFUL BUSINESS OWNERS HAVE

06:28:58.081 --> 06:28:59.582
STAMPED AN UNJUSTIFIABLE STIGMA

06:28:59.649 --> 06:29:01.618
OF UNFAIR COMPETITION TOWARDS

06:29:01.685 --> 06:29:02.786
VENDORS, THESE COMPLAINTS HAVE

06:29:02.852 --> 06:29:04.354
HELPED CREATE AN ANTI VENDOR

06:29:04.421 --> 06:29:05.955
ATMOSPHERE. THIS IS EVEN MORE

06:29:06.022 --> 06:29:07.757
TERRIFYING TODAY BECAUSE OF THE

06:29:07.824 --> 06:29:08.792
CURRENT ANTI-IMMIGRANT

06:29:08.858 --> 06:29:09.225
ATMOSPHERE, WITH THE

06:29:09.292 --> 06:29:09.726
CONSEQUENCES OF SHARING

06:29:09.793 --> 06:29:12.062
SENSITIVE INFORMATION COULD LEAD

06:29:12.128 --> 06:29:13.630
TO DEPORTATION. FOR EXAMPLE, ICE

06:29:13.697 --> 06:29:15.432
CANNOT CITIES FOR DATA ABOUT

06:29:15.498 --> 06:29:16.599
VENDORS SUCH AS PLACE OF

06:29:16.666 --> 06:29:18.034
RESIDENCY AND VENDING LOCATION

06:29:18.101 --> 06:29:19.836
WITHOUT ANY DUE PROCESS. MANY

06:29:19.903 --> 06:29:21.371
STREET VENDORS ARE UNDOCUMENTED

06:29:21.438 --> 06:29:22.572
AND MANY DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH, SO

06:29:22.639 --> 06:29:24.774
THE CHANCES OF THEM CHALLENGING

06:29:24.841 --> 06:29:25.775
DISCRIMINATORY LAWS IN COURT IS

06:29:25.842 --> 06:29:28.211
VERY LOW. I HOPE WE CAN WORK

06:29:28.278 --> 06:29:29.512
TOGETHER TODAY TO CHANGE THESE

06:29:29.579 --> 06:29:31.715
LAWS, AND I HOPE IN THE FUTURE

06:29:31.781 --> 06:29:32.482
TO BE SOMEONE WHO CAN REWRITE

06:29:32.549 --> 06:29:34.884
AND CHALLENGE ANTI VENDOR LAWS

06:29:34.951 --> 06:29:37.454
IN COURT. BEFORE I GO, I WANT TO

06:29:37.520 --> 06:29:38.655
EMPHASIZE THAT I'M NOT JUST HERE

06:29:38.722 --> 06:29:40.590
FIGHTING FOR MY JOB, I'M

06:29:40.657 --> 06:29:41.424

06:29:41.491 --> 06:29:42.659

06:29:42.726 --> 06:29:43.993
FAMILIES TOGETHER AND THRIVING.

06:29:44.060 --> 06:29:45.628
MY CHILDREN DESERVE THE RIGHT TO

06:29:45.695 --> 06:29:46.930
HAVE THEIR FATHER PRESENT TO

06:29:46.996 --> 06:29:48.798
SUPPORT THEM EMOTIONALLY AND

06:29:48.865 --> 06:29:50.900
ECONOMICALLY, AND I WILL FIGHT

06:29:50.967 --> 06:29:51.701
TO RETAIN THAT RIGHT FOR ALL OF

06:29:51.768 --> 06:29:53.870

IMPORTANTLY, OUR AREA IS JUST

06:33:37.794 --> 06:33:39.062
DIFFERENT THINGS AND KNOW THAT

THE STREET VENDORS ARE THE

06:33:40.863 --> 06:33:42.598
HEARTBEAT OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS.

06:33:42.665 --> 06:33:43.666

06:33:50.106 --> 06:33:53.242
DOES PROTECT THEM FROM BEING

06:33:53.309 --> 06:33:54.677

06:33:54.744 --> 06:33:56.512

06:33:59.615 --> 06:34:00.950
HAVE TO LIVE IN FEAR THAT ARE

06:34:01.017 --> 06:34:02.585
JUST SIMPLY SHARING THEIR CRAFTS

06:34:02.652 --> 06:34:05.021
OF, YOU KNOW, BEING ABLE TO MAKE

06:34:05.088 --> 06:34:07.557
OR TACOS OR NOODLES AND HAVING

06:34:07.623 --> 06:34:09.659
IT LEAD TO ARRESTS AND

06:34:09.726 --> 06:34:10.793
DEPORTATION. AND THERE ARE MANY

06:34:10.860 --> 06:34:12.729
PEOPLE WHO BENEFIT FROM THE FROM

06:34:12.795 --> 06:34:14.430
THE LABOR, FROM THE FRUITS THAT

06:34:14.497 --> 06:34:15.932
WE SEE AND THE CULTURES. BUT

06:34:15.999 --> 06:34:16.966
THEN THEY WANT TO CRIMINALIZE

06:34:17.033 --> 06:34:18.801
THEM AND PENALIZE THEM. AND SO

06:34:18.868 --> 06:34:20.036
THIS BILL HELPS TO SAFEGUARD

06:34:20.103 --> 06:34:21.637
THEM, TO PROTECT, PROTECT OUR

06:34:21.704 --> 06:34:23.373
STREET VENDORS WHO ARE JUST

06:34:23.439 --> 06:34:25.174
TRYING TO GET BY AND HAVE A

06:34:25.241 --> 06:34:26.642
LIVING, PUT A ROOF OVER THEIR

06:34:26.709 --> 06:34:28.211
HEADS, SEND THEIR KIDS TO

06:34:28.277 --> 06:34:28.911
SCHOOL, AND THEY'RE NOT

06:34:28.978 --> 06:34:30.680
DEPENDING ON THEIR GOVERNMENT TO

06:34:30.747 --> 06:34:32.415
GET THEM BY THEIR DEPENDING ON

06:34:32.482 --> 06:34:34.584
THEMSELVES AND BEING OUT THERE

06:34:34.650 --> 06:34:35.718
EVERY DAY. AND WE HAVE BEEN

06:34:35.785 --> 06:34:37.220
WATCHING IN LOS ANGELES,

06:34:37.286 --> 06:34:39.055
SPECIFICALLY, WHERE TACO TRUCKS

06:34:39.122 --> 06:34:41.024
ON THEIR OWN ARE BEING RAIDED.

06:34:41.090 --> 06:34:42.925
AND UNFORTUNATELY, PRIOR TO THE

06:34:42.992 --> 06:34:44.260
RAIDS, THEY WERE BEING ROBBED.

06:34:44.327 --> 06:34:46.496
AND SO EVERY MEASURE IN PLACE

06:34:46.562 --> 06:34:47.897
THAT THIS BILL IS DOING IS

06:34:47.964 --> 06:34:48.965
SAFEGUARDING THAT AND TO THE

06:34:54.404 --> 06:34:55.438

HARD WORKING PEOPLE ARE TRYING

06:35:15.324 --> 06:35:17.627
TO ACCOMPLISH IN THEIR LIVES AND

06:35:17.693 --> 06:35:18.661
GIVE THEM SOME SUPPORT. SO

YOU, MR. CHAIR. AND VERY RELATED

06:36:15.351 --> 06:36:17.920
TO THE STREET VENDORS. BECAUSE

06:36:17.987 --> 06:36:19.956
OF THE RAIDS THAT HAVE BEEN

06:36:20.022 --> 06:36:21.724
TAKING PLACE ALL OVER CALIFORNIA

06:36:21.791 --> 06:36:25.094
AND OTHER STATES, THERE'S REAL

06:36:25.161 --> 06:36:27.930
FEAR IN LOS ANGELES RIGHT NOW.

06:36:27.997 --> 06:36:30.099
PARENTS, WORKERS, GRANDPARENTS,

06:36:30.166 --> 06:36:32.068
YOUNG PEOPLE, THEY'RE SCARED TO

06:36:32.135 --> 06:36:34.103
GO ABOUT THEIR DAILY LIVES AS A

06:36:34.170 --> 06:36:36.239
RESULT OF THESE MASS IMMIGRATION

06:36:36.305 --> 06:36:38.741
RAIDS. WE ARE SEEING ARMED AND

06:36:38.808 --> 06:36:41.744
MASKED MEN LEAP OUT OF UNMARKED

06:36:41.811 --> 06:36:43.045
VEHICLES YELLING AND CARRYING

06:36:43.112 --> 06:36:45.715
ASSAULT RIFLES, LATINO MEN TAKEN

06:36:45.781 --> 06:36:47.383
FROM THEIR PLACES OF WORK OR

06:36:47.450 --> 06:36:49.218
WHILE WAITING FOR THE BUS.

06:36:49.285 --> 06:36:50.953
STREET VENDORS, AS WE SAID,

06:36:51.020 --> 06:36:52.755
VIOLENTLY TACKLED TO THE GROUND

06:36:52.822 --> 06:36:55.958
AND FORCEFULLY HELD DOWN. ON

06:36:56.025 --> 06:36:58.494
JUNE 17TH, ADRIAN MARTINEZ, A 20

06:36:58.561 --> 06:37:00.329
YEAR OLD UNITED STATES CITIZEN

06:37:00.396 --> 06:37:02.798
FROM LOS ANGELES, WAS VIOLENTLY

06:37:02.865 --> 06:37:05.735
DETAINED BY ICE AGENTS AFTER

06:37:05.801 --> 06:37:08.271
DEFENDING AN ELDERLY JANITOR

06:37:08.337 --> 06:37:10.806
DURING A RAID OUTSIDE A WALMART.

06:37:10.873 --> 06:37:12.608
THE AGENTS ATTACKED MARTINEZ,

06:37:12.675 --> 06:37:14.010
THROWING HIM TO THE GROUND AND

06:37:14.076 --> 06:37:16.078
ARRESTING HIM AS THEY ASKED HIM

06:37:16.145 --> 06:37:20.917
FOR PROOF. HE WAS PROOF THAT HE

06:37:20.983 --> 06:37:23.386
WAS BORN IN THE UNITED STATES.

06:37:23.452 --> 06:37:25.621
MARTINEZ WAS HELD IN CUSTODY FOR

06:37:25.688 --> 06:37:27.056
THREE DAYS, DESPITE HIS MOTHER

06:37:27.123 --> 06:37:28.558
SHOWING UP TO THE FACILITY WITH

06:37:28.624 --> 06:37:31.060
HIS U.S. BIRTH CERTIFICATE, HIS

06:37:31.127 --> 06:37:32.862
BODY STILL COVERED WITH CUTS AND

06:37:32.929 --> 06:37:34.163
BRUISES AND WEARING A KNEE

06:37:34.230 --> 06:37:37.166
BRACE. IF SOMEONE RUNS, THEY'RE

06:37:37.233 --> 06:37:39.302
TAKEN. WHEN THEY DON'T ANSWER A

06:37:39.368 --> 06:37:40.836
QUESTION, THEY'RE TAKEN WHEN

06:37:40.903 --> 06:37:42.505
THEY CAN'T PRODUCE PAPERS,

06:37:42.572 --> 06:37:44.707
THEY'RE TAKEN NOT KNOWING IF

06:37:44.774 --> 06:37:46.509
IT'S A LAW ENFORCEMENT OPERATION

06:37:46.576 --> 06:37:49.312
OR A KIDNAPING. SINCE EARLY

06:37:49.378 --> 06:37:51.547
JUNE, THE STREETS OF LOS ANGELES

06:37:51.614 --> 06:37:54.817
HAVE BORNE WITNESS TO FREQUENT

06:37:54.884 --> 06:37:56.953
MILITARY STYLE IMMIGRATION RAIDS

06:37:57.019 --> 06:37:58.254
THAT HAVE SEEN PEOPLE, QUOTE

06:37:58.321 --> 06:38:01.224
UNQUOTE, SUSPECTED OF BEING

06:38:01.290 --> 06:38:03.960
UNDOCUMENTED MIGRANTS DETAINED.

06:38:04.026 --> 06:38:07.396
SOME HAVE BEEN DEPORTED. THIS

06:38:07.463 --> 06:38:09.465
ISN'T LAW AND ORDER. IT'S FEAR

06:38:09.532 --> 06:38:13.169
AND CHAOS MEANT TO DIVIDE US. AS

06:38:13.236 --> 06:38:15.271
CR NINE STRONGLY DENOUNCES THE

06:38:15.338 --> 06:38:18.174
MASS IMMIGRATION RAIDS TARGETING

06:38:18.241 --> 06:38:19.609
WORKERS, THEIR FAMILIES IN OUR

06:38:19.675 --> 06:38:21.711
STATE, AND REAFFIRMS THE

06:38:21.777 --> 06:38:23.312
PROTECTIONS OF CIVIL LIBERTIES

06:38:23.379 --> 06:38:25.982
AND HUMAN DIGNITY. WE MUST STAND

06:38:26.048 --> 06:38:28.251
FIRM IN OUR COMMITMENT TO

06:38:28.317 --> 06:38:30.052
CONSTITUTIONAL AND HUMAN RIGHTS,

06:38:30.119 --> 06:38:32.888
AND CLEARLY OPPOSE PRESIDENT

06:38:32.955 --> 06:38:35.091
TRUMP'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL

06:38:35.157 --> 06:38:37.593
ACTIONS. THIS ADMINISTRATION MAY

06:38:37.660 --> 06:38:39.028
CLAIM THAT THESE RAIDS ARE ABOUT

06:38:39.095 --> 06:38:41.163
ROOTING OUT VIOLENT CRIMINALS,

06:38:41.230 --> 06:38:43.666
BUT WE KNOW BETTER. MAKE NO

06:38:43.733 --> 06:38:45.368
MISTAKE TARGETING PEOPLE IN

06:38:45.434 --> 06:38:47.970
THEIR WORKPLACES, CHASING PEOPLE

06:38:48.037 --> 06:38:49.872
THROUGH THE FIELDS OF

06:38:49.939 --> 06:38:51.240
CALIFORNIA'S FRUITS AND

06:38:51.307 --> 06:38:54.110
VEGETABLE FIELDS, DEPLOYING THE

06:38:54.176 --> 06:38:56.312
NATIONAL GUARD ON PROTESTING

06:38:56.379 --> 06:38:59.448
CITIZENS DOES NOTHING BUT EXUDE

06:38:59.515 --> 06:39:02.418
LAWLESSNESS AND CHAOS. PRESIDENT

06:39:02.485 --> 06:39:06.055
TRUMP HAS MADE CLEAR NO PLACE IS

06:39:06.122 --> 06:39:08.591
SAFE FROM HIS CRUEL MASS, AND

06:39:08.658 --> 06:39:11.761
MANY TIMES ILLEGAL DEPORTATIONS,

06:39:11.827 --> 06:39:14.397
AND THAT HE WILL NOT STOP THE

06:39:14.463 --> 06:39:16.799
FACT THAT THERE IS A QUOTA. A

06:39:16.866 --> 06:39:19.302
TARGET PUT ON PEOPLE IS INHUMANE

06:39:19.368 --> 06:39:22.938
AND DISRUPTIVE. COLLEAGUES, WE

06:39:23.005 --> 06:39:25.775
ARE HOME TO OVER 10.5 MILLION

06:39:25.841 --> 06:39:28.444
IMMIGRANTS WHO PAY $23 BILLION

06:39:28.511 --> 06:39:31.547
IN TAXES EACH YEAR. THEY ARE THE

06:39:31.614 --> 06:39:34.016
HEART OF OUR DIVERSE COMMUNITIES

06:39:34.083 --> 06:39:36.819
WHOSE INVALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS

06:39:36.886 --> 06:39:40.189
ARE VITAL TO KEY SECTORS.

06:39:40.256 --> 06:39:42.792
AGRICULTURE, HEALTH CARE, HOTELS

06:39:42.858 --> 06:39:45.227
AND RESTAURANTS, CHILD CARE AND

06:39:45.294 --> 06:39:47.730
CONSTRUCTION. AND YET, THE

06:39:47.797 --> 06:39:49.665
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FAILS TO

06:39:49.732 --> 06:39:52.902
RECOGNIZE THEM AS HUMAN BEINGS.

06:39:52.968 --> 06:39:53.903
CHILDREN HAVE NIGHTMARES

06:39:53.969 --> 06:39:55.705
THINKING ABOUT WHICH DAY THEY

06:39:55.771 --> 06:39:57.907
WILL NO LONGER SEE THEIR FATHER

06:39:57.973 --> 06:40:00.776
OR MOTHER. SOME PEOPLE MAY

06:40:00.843 --> 06:40:02.545
CHOOSE TO DISMISS THE

06:40:02.611 --> 06:40:03.979
CREDIBILITY OF THE TESTIMONIES

06:40:04.046 --> 06:40:06.082
AND THE REPORTS THAT WE'VE

06:40:06.148 --> 06:40:09.051
HEARD, BUT NOT ONE DAY GOES BY

06:40:09.118 --> 06:40:10.953
THAT VIOLENT INCIDENTS DON'T

06:40:11.020 --> 06:40:13.422
OCCUR. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR.

06:40:13.489 --> 06:40:15.057
NEXT, I HAVE TWO WITNESSES IN

06:40:15.124 --> 06:40:18.127

MILITARY STYLE RAID IN CAMARILLO

06:40:57.299 --> 06:40:59.468
LAST WEEK. WE ARE SEEING OUR

RESTRAINING ORDER. THE TRO

06:41:22.558 --> 06:41:23.526
BLOCKS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

06:41:23.592 --> 06:41:25.428

HAVE A STRONG AFFINITY AND

06:48:17.573 --> 06:48:18.841
RESPECT FOR SENATOR DURAZO. I

06:48:18.907 --> 06:48:20.943
WOULDN'T BE HERE IF IT WASN'T

06:48:21.009 --> 06:48:22.311
FOR HER, AND MANY OF US WOULDN'T

06:48:22.377 --> 06:48:23.879
BE HERE IF IT WASN'T FOR HER.

06:48:23.946 --> 06:48:26.081
AND I KNOW YOU, MORE THAN ANYONE

COMMUNITY STRICKEN BY THESE FEAR

06:48:30.018 --> 06:48:31.320
AND THESE RAIDS. I'M

06:48:31.386 --> 06:48:32.688
WHOLEHEARTEDLY BEHIND THIS

06:48:32.754 --> 06:48:34.556
RESOLUTION, AND I WANT FOLKS TO

06:48:34.623 --> 06:48:36.525
REMEMBER THAT WE ARE A STATE OF

06:48:36.592 --> 06:48:38.193
DREAMERS. WE ARE A STATE OF

06:48:38.260 --> 06:48:39.962
DOERS. WE ARE A STATE OF

06:48:40.028 --> 06:48:41.263
DIGNITY. AND IN CALIFORNIA, WE

06:48:41.330 --> 06:48:43.799
DO NOT BUILD OUR FUTURE ON FEAR.

06:48:43.866 --> 06:48:45.667
WE BUILD OUR FUTURE ON OUR

06:48:45.734 --> 06:48:47.469
FAMILY, ON OUR WORK, ON OUR

06:48:47.536 --> 06:48:50.239
HOPE. AND WE AS A STATE, NEED TO

06:48:50.305 --> 06:48:51.640
CONTINUE TO DENOUNCE THESE MASS

06:48:51.707 --> 06:48:53.675
ILLEGAL RAIDS. AND WE HAVE TO

06:48:53.742 --> 06:48:55.744
CONDEMN ANY ACT THAT TEARS

06:48:55.811 --> 06:48:57.546
PARENTS FROM THEIR CHILDREN,

06:48:57.613 --> 06:49:00.115
THAT TEARS WORKERS FROM THEIR

06:49:00.182 --> 06:49:01.083
JOBS AND OUR NEIGHBORS FROM

06:49:01.149 --> 06:49:03.619
THEIR HOMES. THIS RESOLUTION IS

06:49:03.685 --> 06:49:06.521
MORE THAN WORDS. IT'S A STAND

06:49:06.588 --> 06:49:08.290
FOR HUMANITY. IT'S A STAND FOR

06:49:08.357 --> 06:49:10.259
COMPASSION, AND IT'S A STAND FOR

06:49:10.325 --> 06:49:12.294
JUSTICE AND FOR THE SOUL OF OUR

06:49:12.361 --> 06:49:14.196

06:49:16.031 --> 06:49:18.133

I WALKED TO A LOCAL SHOPPING

06:55:18.293 --> 06:55:19.728
A BLACK DODGE CHARGER WITH

06:55:19.794 --> 06:55:21.263
TINTED WINDOWS PULLED IN. IT

06:55:21.329 --> 06:55:23.565
LOOKED SUSPICIOUS, SO I FOLLOWED

06:55:23.632 --> 06:55:25.734
IT AND SAW BARRICADES IN THE

06:55:25.800 --> 06:55:28.236
BACK SEAT. THIS WAS AN UNMARKED

06:55:28.303 --> 06:55:29.638
VEHICLE CLEARLY BEING USED TO

06:55:29.704 --> 06:55:31.373
DETAIN PEOPLE. WHEN I TRIED TO

06:55:31.439 --> 06:55:32.874
TAKE THE PHOTO OF THE LICENSE

06:55:32.941 --> 06:55:35.377
PLATE, THE DRIVER JUMPED OUT. HE

06:55:35.443 --> 06:55:37.445
WORE PLAIN CLOTHES, A TACTICAL

06:55:37.512 --> 06:55:39.614
VEST, A MASK OVER HIS FACE AND

06:55:39.681 --> 06:55:41.516
POINTED WHAT LOOKED LIKE A GUN

06:55:41.583 --> 06:55:42.417
AT ME. HE TOLD ME TO BACK AWAY

06:55:42.484 --> 06:55:44.352
FROM HIS VEHICLE, BUT GAVE NO

06:55:44.419 --> 06:55:46.254
NAME, NO BADGE AND NO

06:55:46.321 --> 06:55:47.922
EXPLANATION. HE ACTED WITH

06:55:47.989 --> 06:55:49.958
FORCE, BUT WITHOUT ANY

06:55:50.025 --> 06:55:51.559
ACCOUNTABILITY, AS IF HE COULD

06:55:51.626 --> 06:55:53.194
DO WHATEVER HE WANTED. THAT

06:55:53.261 --> 06:55:54.229
MOMENT WAS TERRIFYING. IT SHOULD

06:55:54.296 --> 06:55:58.266
NEVER HAPPEN TO ANYONE. SB 805

06:55:58.333 --> 06:56:00.201
THE NÓ VIGILANTES ACT EXPANDS

06:56:00.268 --> 06:56:01.503
LAWS AGAINST POLICE

06:56:01.569 --> 06:56:03.004
IMPERSONATION TO ADDRESS GROWING

06:56:03.071 --> 06:56:03.972
FEAR AND CONFUSION FROM

06:56:04.039 --> 06:56:07.208
AGGRESSIVE OPERATIONS AND RISING

06:56:07.275 --> 06:56:09.344
IMPERSONATION CASES. IT ENSURES

06:56:09.411 --> 06:56:11.546
ANYONE ACTING AS LAW ENFORCEMENT

06:56:11.613 --> 06:56:13.081
IDENTIFIES THEMSELVES AS

06:56:13.148 --> 06:56:15.884
FOLLOWS. CLEAR. FOLLOWS CLEAR.

06:56:15.950 --> 06:56:17.686
CLEAR RULES CREATE AN

06:56:17.752 --> 06:56:19.421
ACCOUNTABILITY WHERE THERE

06:56:19.487 --> 06:56:21.589
CURRENTLY IS NONE, FOR THE

06:56:21.656 --> 06:56:22.991
SAFETY AND DIGNITY AND THE

06:56:23.058 --> 06:56:24.926
DIGNITY OF EVERY CALIFORNIAN. I

06:56:24.993 --> 06:56:27.762
URGE YOU TO SUPPORT. THANK YOU.

06:56:27.829 --> 06:56:29.497
GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS

SB 805. I WANT TO THANK THE

06:56:38.807 --> 06:56:39.641
SENATOR FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON

06:56:39.708 --> 06:56:42.577
THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. SB 805

06:56:42.644 --> 06:56:43.912
WOULD REQUIRE FEDERAL LAW

06:56:43.978 --> 06:56:45.380
ENFORCEMENT AGENTS, AS WELL AS

06:56:45.447 --> 06:56:47.282
STATE AGENTS, TO WEAR UNIFORMS

06:56:47.349 --> 06:56:48.950
THAT PROPERLY IDENTIFY

06:56:49.017 --> 06:56:50.518
THEMSELVES AND ENSURE THAT WE

06:56:50.585 --> 06:56:51.920
KNOW WHAT AGENCIES THEY ARE

06:56:51.986 --> 06:56:53.955
AFFILIATED WITH. SB 805 IS A

06:56:54.022 --> 06:56:55.523
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT MEASURE DUE

06:56:55.590 --> 06:56:57.625
TO THE WARRANTLESS ARRESTS AND

06:56:57.692 --> 06:56:59.494
DETENTIONS, OFTEN BY MASKED

06:56:59.561 --> 06:57:00.829
INDIVIDUALS DRESSED IN MILITARY

06:57:00.895 --> 06:57:03.398

INDIVIDUALS FOR ARREST AND

06:57:05.967 --> 06:57:07.802
DETENTION WITH NO REGARD TO DUE

06:57:07.869 --> 06:57:09.804
PROCESS. SIMPLY PUT, THESE RAIDS

06:57:09.871 --> 06:57:11.639
ARE MILITARIZED ENFORCEMENT

06:57:11.706 --> 06:57:13.441
ACTIONS WAGED AGAINST ALL

06:57:13.508 --> 06:57:14.909
CIVILIANS IN PLACES LIKE LOS

06:57:14.976 --> 06:57:18.480

FORTIFIED BY THE NATIONAL GUARD

AND THE MARINES. LET'S BE CLEAR

06:57:27.455 --> 06:57:29.190
THERE ARE NO CHECKS AND BALANCES

06:57:29.257 --> 06:57:30.792
OR ANY OVERSIGHT OF THESE

06:57:30.859 --> 06:57:32.527
ACTIVITIES. AND WHEN INDIVIDUALS

06:57:32.594 --> 06:57:33.795
ASK WHY THEY ARE BEING DETAINED

06:57:33.862 --> 06:57:35.897
OR ARRESTED, THEIR QUESTIONS GO

06:57:35.964 --> 06:57:37.265
UNANSWERED. WE HAVE FAMILY

06:57:55.350 --> 06:57:56.684
PLEASE CONTINUE TO GO

06:57:56.751 --> 06:57:59.220

IMMIGRATION STATUSES, INCLUDING

06:58:03.191 --> 06:58:05.160
U.S. CITIZENS. IN ONE INSTANCE,

06:58:05.226 --> 06:58:06.795
A YOUNG MAN WAS ATTACKED AND

06:58:06.861 --> 06:58:08.863
ARRESTED BY MASKED MEN NEAR HIS

WITHOUT ANY IDENTIFYING

06:58:12.867 --> 06:58:14.602

06:58:14.669 --> 06:58:16.271
WORKED WITH SEVERAL MEMBERS OF

06:58:16.337 --> 06:58:17.305
CONGRESS AND THIS YOUNG MAN'S

06:58:17.372 --> 06:58:19.340
MOTHER TO TRY TO LOCATE HIM. IT

06:58:19.407 --> 06:58:21.276
TOOK US OVER THREE DAYS TO FIND

06:58:21.342 --> 06:58:23.311
WHERE HE WAS BEING DETAINED.

06:58:23.378 --> 06:58:24.813
SIMILARLY, I SPOKEN TO AN

06:58:24.879 --> 06:58:26.514
INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS ARRESTED ON

06:58:26.581 --> 06:58:28.783
ONE OF THE FIRST RAIDS ON THAT

06:58:28.850 --> 06:58:31.319
JUNE 6TH AT AMBIANCE, WHERE MEN

06:58:31.386 --> 06:58:32.921

06:58:32.987 --> 06:58:34.556

ARREST. WHEN HE PRESENTED THE

06:58:44.699 --> 06:58:46.568
AGENTS WITH A RED CARD OR A CARD

06:58:46.634 --> 06:58:48.937
THAT SAYS, I REFUSE TO SPEAK TO

06:58:49.003 --> 06:58:50.138
YOU UNTIL I HAVE MY IMMIGRATION

06:58:50.205 --> 06:58:50.738
ATTORNEY PRESENT, THEY JUST

06:58:50.805 --> 06:58:52.273
LAUGHED AT HIM AND TOLD HIM, YOU

06:58:52.340 --> 06:58:54.309
HAVE NO RIGHTS. HE HAD NO IDEA

06:58:54.375 --> 06:58:56.077
WHO THESE MASKED MEN WERE AND

06:58:56.144 --> 06:58:57.912
WHY THEY WERE POINTING MILITARY,

06:58:57.979 --> 06:58:59.314
WHY THEY WERE DRESSED IN

06:58:59.380 --> 06:59:00.648
MILITARY GEAR AND POINTING

06:59:00.715 --> 06:59:02.884
WEAPONS AT HIM. IN MY ALMOST 30

06:59:02.951 --> 06:59:04.252
YEARS OF PRACTICE AS AN

06:59:04.319 --> 06:59:05.520
IMMIGRATION LAWYER, I HAVE NEVER

06:59:05.587 --> 06:59:07.288
SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. WHILE

06:59:07.355 --> 06:59:08.690
THIS ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO

06:59:08.756 --> 06:59:10.458
DISTRACT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC

06:59:10.525 --> 06:59:12.627
ABOUT THE NEED TO PROTECT

06:59:12.694 --> 06:59:14.095
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT AGENTS,

06:59:14.162 --> 06:59:16.264
VIOLENCE IS CONTINUALLY BEING

06:59:16.331 --> 06:59:17.665
WAGED AGAINST OUR COMMUNITY

06:59:17.732 --> 06:59:20.235
MEMBERS, AND THIS ADMINISTRATION

06:59:20.301 --> 06:59:21.402
WILL CONTINUE TO TEST HOW FAR

06:59:21.469 --> 06:59:23.371
THEY CAN GO. THIS IS AN

06:59:23.438 --> 06:59:24.506
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT MEASURE, AND

06:59:24.572 --> 06:59:28.176
WE NEED TO PASS THIS LEGISLATION

06:59:28.243 --> 06:59:29.577
TODAY. ONE OF THE THINGS I DO

06:59:29.644 --> 06:59:32.547
WANT TO RAISE IS THAT THE STATE

06:59:32.614 --> 06:59:33.414
OF CALIFORNIA HAS A REALLY BIG

06:59:33.481 --> 06:59:34.582
INTEREST HERE IN ENSURING THAT

06:59:34.649 --> 06:59:36.518
WE KNOW WHO THESE INDIVIDUALS

06:59:36.584 --> 06:59:38.486
ARE. WE SPENT SO MANY YEARS AS A

06:59:38.553 --> 06:59:40.355
STATE ENSURING THAT LAW

06:59:40.421 --> 06:59:41.422
ENFORCEMENT AND IMMIGRANT

06:59:41.489 --> 06:59:42.156
COMMUNITIES, THAT IMMIGRANT

06:59:42.223 --> 06:59:43.625
COMMUNITIES CAN TRUST LAW

06:59:43.691 --> 06:59:45.026
ENFORCEMENT ENTITIES. AND MY

06:59:45.093 --> 06:59:47.896
CONCERN IS THAT ALL OF THIS

06:59:47.962 --> 06:59:48.496
TRUST IS BEING ERODED AS WE

06:59:48.563 --> 06:59:50.198
SPEAK. SO FOR THESE REASONS, I

06:59:50.265 --> 06:59:51.900
URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR SB 805.

06:59:51.966 --> 06:59:53.635

DETAINED. WHERE WERE THEY FOUND?

07:03:24.579 --> 07:03:25.713
THEY WERE FOUND IN FEDERAL

07:03:25.780 --> 07:03:27.482
CUSTODY. BUT IT DID TAKE US

07:03:27.548 --> 07:03:28.716
SEVERAL DAYS TO FIND THEM. AND

07:03:28.783 --> 07:03:30.384

YEARS, BUT NO AGENCY RECOGNIZES

07:04:10.124 --> 07:04:11.859
THOSE YET. I DON'T KNOW IF ANY

07:04:11.926 --> 07:04:13.194
AGENCIES RECOGNIZE THEM, BUT

07:04:13.261 --> 07:04:15.196
PEOPLE DEFINITELY USE THEM WHEN

07:04:15.263 --> 07:04:16.597
THEY ARE CONFRONTED WITH

07:04:16.664 --> 07:04:18.599
IMMIGRATION OFFICERS. YOU'RE

07:04:18.666 --> 07:04:20.101
BASICALLY SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE

07:04:20.168 --> 07:04:22.336

BY ANY SORT OF AGENCY. BUT WHAT

07:04:32.814 --> 07:04:34.549
IS RECOGNIZED IS THE

07:04:34.615 --> 07:04:35.917
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO REMAIN

07:04:39.353 --> 07:04:41.322
DIFFERENT LANGUAGES, SPANISH,

07:04:41.389 --> 07:04:42.690
CHINESE, TO ENSURE PEOPLE ARE

07:04:42.757 --> 07:04:46.027

07:04:52.934 --> 07:04:56.037
SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF THOSE ARE

07:04:56.103 --> 07:04:57.238

07:05:06.380 --> 07:05:08.382
AUTHOR AND THANK THE WITNESSES.

07:05:08.449 --> 07:05:09.183
AND THANK EVERYBODY AT THE DÍAS

07:05:09.250 --> 07:05:10.585
WHO CAME TO AN UNDERSTANDING AND

07:05:10.651 --> 07:05:12.019
AGREEMENT, FROM WHAT I

07:05:12.086 --> 07:05:13.588
UNDERSTAND IN THE LAST COUPLE OF

07:05:13.654 --> 07:05:14.922
HOURS. SO THANK YOU TO THE

07:05:14.989 --> 07:05:16.057
AUTHOR FOR THAT. LOOK, JUST

07:05:16.123 --> 07:05:17.692
REINSTATING RESTATING IN

07:05:17.758 --> 07:05:18.793
CALIFORNIA, WE BELIEVE SAFETY

07:05:18.860 --> 07:05:20.528
COMES WITH TRANSPARENCY AND NOT

07:05:20.595 --> 07:05:22.897
FEAR. OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE THE

07:05:22.964 --> 07:05:24.565
RIGHT TO KNOW WHO IS KNOCKING AT

07:05:24.632 --> 07:05:26.467
THEIR DOOR. OR IN THIS CASE,

07:05:26.534 --> 07:05:28.536
LET'S BE REAL, WHO THE RIGHT TO

07:05:28.603 --> 07:05:30.104
KNOW THEIR WHO THEIR IDENTIFY,

07:05:30.171 --> 07:05:31.772
WHO THEIR KIDNAPER IS, WHO THE

07:05:31.839 --> 07:05:32.940
ICE AGENT IS THAT'S BREAKING

07:05:33.007 --> 07:05:34.709
INTO THEIR CAR, OR GRABBING

07:05:34.775 --> 07:05:36.043
INDIVIDUALS AT A ROUTINE DOCTOR

07:05:36.110 --> 07:05:37.044
APPOINTMENT OR SIMPLY GETTING

07:05:37.111 --> 07:05:40.014
THEIR CAR WASHED. WE RESPECT LAW

07:05:40.081 --> 07:05:41.515
ENFORCEMENT, BUT RESPECT AND

07:05:41.582 --> 07:05:43.284
TRUST BEGINS WITH

07:05:43.351 --> 07:05:45.519
ACCOUNTABILITY. SB 805 IS ABOUT

07:05:45.586 --> 07:05:46.654
MAKING SURE THAT NO ONE, NOT

07:05:46.721 --> 07:05:48.356
EVEN FEDERAL AGENTS, CAN OPERATE

07:05:48.422 --> 07:05:50.424
IN SILENCE OR SECRECY BECAUSE

07:05:50.491 --> 07:05:52.660
TRUST IS EARNED IN LIGHT, NOT

07:05:52.727 --> 07:05:54.528
HIDDEN BEHIND A MASK, OR

07:05:54.595 --> 07:05:56.230
DISPLAYED BEHIND THEIR BADGE OF

07:05:56.297 --> 07:05:57.632
HONOR. AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF

07:05:57.698 --> 07:05:59.901
IT'S BEEN MOVED YET, BUT I'D

07:05:59.967 --> 07:06:01.502
LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL. WE'LL

07:06:01.569 --> 07:06:03.371
TREAT THAT AS A MOTION. IS THERE

07:06:03.437 --> 07:06:04.605
A SECOND, SECOND, SECOND BY

07:06:04.672 --> 07:06:06.540
RAMOS? OKAY. ANYTHING ELSE, MR.

07:06:06.607 --> 07:06:08.175
GONZALEZ? ALL RIGHT. WE'LL

07:06:08.242 --> 07:06:08.709
CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION.

07:06:08.776 --> 07:06:11.612
ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO WEIGH IN?

07:06:11.679 --> 07:06:13.080
OKAY. SENATOR PEREZ, WOULD YOU

07:06:13.147 --> 07:06:15.283
LIKE TO CLOSE? YEAH. WELL,

07:06:15.349 --> 07:06:17.251
AGAIN, JUST WANT TO THANK THIS

07:06:17.318 --> 07:06:19.020
COMMITTEE FOR ALL OF THEIR WORK

07:06:19.086 --> 07:06:20.354
ON THE AMENDMENTS. I KNOW, YOU

07:06:20.421 --> 07:06:21.689
KNOW, WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS

07:06:21.756 --> 07:06:23.591
UNTIL LATE IN THE EVENING. SO

07:06:23.658 --> 07:06:25.259
APPRECIATE THAT AND ALSO

07:06:25.326 --> 07:06:26.494
APPRECIATE THE FEEDBACK THAT

07:06:26.560 --> 07:06:28.562
WE'VE RECEIVED FROM LAW

07:06:28.629 --> 07:06:30.298
ENFORCEMENT. YOU KNOW, WHEN WE

07:06:30.364 --> 07:06:32.333
FIRST STARTED WORKING ON THIS

07:06:32.400 --> 07:06:34.302
BILL, IT ACTUALLY CAME AS AN

07:06:34.368 --> 07:06:35.436
INSPIRATION FOR MANY OF THE

07:06:35.503 --> 07:06:37.672
POLICE CHIEFS IN MY AREA WHO HAD

07:06:37.738 --> 07:06:40.174
RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THE FACT

07:06:40.241 --> 07:06:41.909
THAT THE FEDERAL AND IMMIGRATION

07:06:41.976 --> 07:06:43.744
ENFORCEMENT AGENTS ARE NOT DOING

07:06:43.811 --> 07:06:45.212
ANY SORT OF COORDINATION WITH

07:06:45.279 --> 07:06:46.814
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND THAT

07:06:46.881 --> 07:06:48.749
IS INHERENTLY PRESENTING A

07:06:48.816 --> 07:06:50.985
PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE FOR SMALL

07:06:51.052 --> 07:06:53.454
CITIES LIKE MINE. I REPRESENT 19

07:06:53.521 --> 07:06:55.089
CITIES IN THE SAN GABRIEL

07:06:55.156 --> 07:06:56.691
VALLEY. WE HAVE HAD INSTANCES

07:06:56.757 --> 07:06:58.693
LIKE WHAT YOU HEARD FROM MR.

07:06:58.759 --> 07:07:01.295
FRANCISCO CASTELLON TODAY. YOU

07:07:01.362 --> 07:07:03.864
KNOW, JUST THIS PAST WEEKEND, I

07:07:03.931 --> 07:07:06.801
WAS INFORMED THAT TWO STUDENTS,

07:07:06.867 --> 07:07:08.569
TWO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS

07:07:08.636 --> 07:07:10.104
ATTENDING SUMMER SCHOOL AT

07:07:10.171 --> 07:07:11.939
ALHAMBRA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT

07:07:12.006 --> 07:07:13.941
WERE PULLED ASIDE BY IMMIGRATION

07:07:14.008 --> 07:07:15.343
ENFORCEMENT AND QUESTIONED,

07:07:15.409 --> 07:07:17.144
ASKED FOR THEIR GREEN CARDS.

07:07:17.211 --> 07:07:18.980
THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT

07:07:19.046 --> 07:07:20.614
THAT MEANT BECAUSE THEY ARE HIGH

07:07:20.681 --> 07:07:21.949
SCHOOL KIDS, SO THEY PROVIDED

07:07:22.016 --> 07:07:24.352
THEIR STUDENT IDS. AFTER THAT,

07:07:24.418 --> 07:07:26.988
THE PEOPLE LEFT, BUT THEY DIDN'T

07:07:27.054 --> 07:07:28.356
PROVIDE ANY SORT OF

07:07:28.422 --> 07:07:29.757
IDENTIFICATION. WE HAVE NO IDEA

07:07:29.824 --> 07:07:31.325
WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE. I DON'T

07:07:31.392 --> 07:07:32.660
KNOW IF THEY WERE ICE

07:07:32.727 --> 07:07:34.862
IMPERSONATORS OR NOT, BUT THESE

07:07:34.929 --> 07:07:36.330
KIDS AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE NOW

07:07:36.397 --> 07:07:38.232
SO SCARED THAT THEY HAVE DROPPED

07:07:38.299 --> 07:07:40.267
OUT OF SUMMER SCHOOL. THESE ARE

07:07:40.334 --> 07:07:41.736
THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING. WE'VE

07:07:41.802 --> 07:07:44.538
HAD PUBLIC EVENTS, CITY EVENTS

07:07:44.605 --> 07:07:46.440
IN THE CITY OF PASADENA BE

07:07:46.507 --> 07:07:48.509
CANCELED WHEN THESE EVENTS TAKE

07:07:48.576 --> 07:07:51.078
PLACE. IT IS CREATED SO MUCH

07:07:51.145 --> 07:07:52.380
FRUSTRATION AND CHAOS FOR OUR

07:07:52.446 --> 07:07:55.416
LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AND I THINK

07:07:55.483 --> 07:07:58.252
FOR ALL OF US, REGARDLESS OF

07:07:58.319 --> 07:08:00.388
PARTY, WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT

07:08:00.454 --> 07:08:02.523
OUR COMMUNITIES ARE SAFE. WE

07:08:02.590 --> 07:08:04.792
WANT TO PREVENT CHAOTIC

07:08:04.859 --> 07:08:06.827
SITUATIONS LIKE THIS, AND WE

07:08:06.894 --> 07:08:09.063
UNDERSTAND THAT PROPER

07:08:09.130 --> 07:08:10.931
IDENTIFICATION, PROPER OVERSIGHT

07:08:10.998 --> 07:08:13.434
IS SO CRITICAL TO PUBLIC SAFETY.

07:08:13.501 --> 07:08:15.102
AND IT HAS BEEN SO HORRIFYING

07:08:15.169 --> 07:08:16.971
READING CASES ALL ACROSS THE

07:08:17.038 --> 07:08:19.040
COUNTRY OF PEOPLE IMPERSONATING

07:08:19.106 --> 07:08:21.275
ICE OFFICERS. IF PEOPLE

07:08:21.342 --> 07:08:22.977
IMPERSONATING POLICE OFFICERS

07:08:23.044 --> 07:08:24.512
WHO JUST HAD A CASE IN

07:08:24.578 --> 07:08:26.747
MINNESOTA, TWO PUBLIC OFFICIALS

07:08:26.814 --> 07:08:28.149
MURDERED BY SOMEBODY

07:08:28.215 --> 07:08:29.583
IMPERSONATING A POLICE OFFICER,

07:08:29.650 --> 07:08:31.152
THESE ARE VERY SERIOUS EVENTS

07:09:08.489 --> 07:09:09.590
BASIC PREMISE IN OUR JUSTICE

07:09:09.657 --> 07:09:11.192
SYSTEM THAT IF SOMEONE IS GOING

REPORTER WITH BUSINESS INSIDER.

07:18:15.168 --> 07:18:16.603
HE WAS ACTUALLY RECENTLY LAID

07:18:16.670 --> 07:18:18.872
OFF. BUT IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO

07:18:18.939 --> 07:18:20.374
LOOK INTO HIS WORK, HE'S AN

INCREDIBLE WRITER AND

07:18:21.675 --> 07:18:23.877
JOURNALIST. AND THE

07:18:23.944 --> 07:18:24.945
INVESTIGATION HE DID WAS

07:18:25.012 --> 07:18:27.481
ACTUALLY INTO HIS OWN FORMER

07:18:27.547 --> 07:18:28.582

THAT'S HOW HE BEGAN IN COVERING

07:18:31.952 --> 07:18:35.389
THESE CASES. AND IT'S REALLY,

07:18:35.455 --> 07:18:37.357
REALLY POWERFUL TO JUST READ

07:18:37.424 --> 07:18:40.527

CASES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND

07:18:44.364 --> 07:18:46.266
SO I WANT TO GIVE SO MUCH CREDIT

07:18:46.333 --> 07:18:48.101
TO HIM. BUT IT WAS THROUGH HIS

07:18:48.168 --> 07:18:49.403
WORK AND THE STORIES THAT HE

07:18:49.469 --> 07:18:51.705

SHARED THEIR STORIES. AND I'VE

07:18:54.841 --> 07:18:56.176
HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING SO

07:18:56.243 --> 07:18:58.979
MANY OF THEM WHO REALLY INSPIRED

07:18:59.046 --> 07:19:00.981
ME TO WANT TO TAKE ON THIS

07:19:01.048 --> 07:19:02.349

TELLING ME WHEN I WAS 17 YEARS

07:19:10.957 --> 07:19:13.060

07:19:13.126 --> 07:19:13.627
FEELINGS FOR ME AND HE WAS

07:19:13.694 --> 07:19:15.395
ALMOST 20 YEARS MY SENIOR. IT

07:19:15.462 --> 07:19:17.130

07:19:17.197 --> 07:19:18.331
FORTUNATELY, I RAN AWAY BECAUSE

07:19:18.398 --> 07:19:20.067
I UNDERSTOOD THE INAPPROPRIATE

07:19:20.133 --> 07:19:21.768
NATURE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

07:19:21.835 --> 07:19:23.704
BUT I ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT

07:19:23.770 --> 07:19:24.671
HAPPENED TO OTHER CHILDREN THAT

07:19:24.738 --> 07:19:27.641

07:21:28.995 --> 07:21:30.664
PATTERN OF CONDUCT THAT PLACES

07:22:12.138 --> 07:22:14.541
PATTERN OF STALKING. THREATS TO

07:22:14.608 --> 07:22:16.409
FAMILY MEMBERS ARE ALREADY

07:22:16.476 --> 07:22:18.979
COVERED. UNDER STATE LAW, SB 221

07:22:19.045 --> 07:22:21.514
WOULD SIMPLY UPDATE CALIFORNIA'S

07:22:21.581 --> 07:22:23.316
ANTI STALKING LAW BY ADDING

07:22:23.383 --> 07:22:27.153
THREATS TO PETS TO THE LIST OF

07:22:27.220 --> 07:22:28.588
BEHAVIORS USED TO ESTABLISH A

07:22:28.655 --> 07:22:30.423
PATTERN OF STALKING. THIS IS

07:22:30.490 --> 07:22:31.992
VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE, BECAUSE

07:22:32.058 --> 07:22:34.060
IT'S NOT ACTUALLY CHARGING

07:22:34.127 --> 07:22:35.962
SOMEONE WITH THREATENING A PET,

07:22:36.029 --> 07:22:37.964
BUT IT'S ADDING THE THREAT TO A

07:22:38.031 --> 07:22:40.533
PET TO A LIST OF BEHAVIORS USED

07:22:40.600 --> 07:22:42.102
TO ESTABLISH A PATTERN OF

07:22:42.168 --> 07:22:44.504
STALKING. JOINING ME TODAY ARE

07:22:44.571 --> 07:22:46.006
NICK SACKETT WITH THE SOCIAL

07:22:46.072 --> 07:22:47.807
COMPASSION IN LEGISLATION, AND

07:22:47.874 --> 07:22:49.075
ROBERT BROWN WITH THE CALIFORNIA

07:22:49.142 --> 07:22:52.812
DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION.

07:22:52.879 --> 07:22:55.081
THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON, CHAIR

07:22:55.148 --> 07:22:58.184
AND MEMBERS. OUR ORGANIZATION,

07:22:58.251 --> 07:22:59.920
SOCIAL COMPASSION IN

07:22:59.986 --> 07:23:01.788
LEGISLATION, ALONG WITH OVER 60

07:23:01.855 --> 07:23:03.156
OTHERS AND MORE THAN 400

07:23:03.223 --> 07:23:04.491
INDIVIDUALS, STRONGLY SUPPORT

07:23:04.557 --> 07:23:06.359
THIS BILL. WE DEEPLY UNDERSTAND

07:23:06.426 --> 07:23:08.461
THE POWERFUL BOND CALIFORNIANS

07:23:08.528 --> 07:23:10.063
SHARE WITH THEIR ANIMALS. EVERY

07:23:10.130 --> 07:23:12.332
DAY WE WITNESS THE EXTRAORDINARY

07:23:12.399 --> 07:23:13.633
EFFORTS PEOPLE MAKE TO PROTECT

07:23:13.700 --> 07:23:16.202
THEIR PETS THE COMFORT, JOY AND

07:23:16.269 --> 07:23:17.671
UNCONDITIONAL LOVE OUR ANIMALS

07:23:17.737 --> 07:23:21.241
PROVIDE IS TRULY UNIQUE, A 2024

07:23:21.308 --> 07:23:23.843
PEW RESEARCH POLL FOUND THAT 97%

07:23:23.910 --> 07:23:26.279
OF AMERICANS CONSIDER THEIR PET

07:23:26.346 --> 07:23:30.650
FAMILY, WITH 57% OF WOMEN AND

07:23:30.717 --> 07:23:32.619
64% OF LOWER INCOME INDIVIDUALS

07:23:32.686 --> 07:23:34.154
SAYING THEIR PETS ARE AS

07:23:34.220 --> 07:23:35.655
IMPORTANT AS HUMAN FAMILY

07:23:35.722 --> 07:23:38.925
MEMBERS. LEGALLY, ANIMALS MAY BE

07:23:38.992 --> 07:23:40.327
CONSIDERED PROPERTY, BUT THIS

07:23:40.393 --> 07:23:42.095
BILL ACKNOWLEDGES THE EMOTIONAL

07:23:42.162 --> 07:23:44.664
TRUTH WE ALL RECOGNIZE. IF YOUR

07:23:44.731 --> 07:23:46.733
LOVED ONE CAME TO YOU AND SAID

07:23:46.800 --> 07:23:48.935
THEIR EX WAS WILLFULLY AND

07:23:49.002 --> 07:23:50.770
REPEATEDLY HARASSING THEM AND

07:23:50.837 --> 07:23:52.572
MAKING CREDIBLE THREATS TO THEIR

07:23:52.639 --> 07:23:54.240
PET, WOULD YOU WANT TO TELL THEM

07:23:54.307 --> 07:23:56.109
THAT THAT BEHAVIOR ISN'T

07:23:56.176 --> 07:23:57.944
ILLEGAL, THAT NOTHING CAN BE

07:23:58.011 --> 07:23:59.346
DONE UNTIL THE ANIMAL IS

07:23:59.412 --> 07:24:01.781
ACTUALLY HARMED? TO US, THIS

07:24:01.848 --> 07:24:02.782
KIND OF CONDUCT SHOULD ALREADY

07:24:02.849 --> 07:24:05.185
BE A CRIME. WE RESPECTFULLY

07:24:05.251 --> 07:24:06.886
DISAGREE WITH THE OPPOSITION'S

07:24:06.953 --> 07:24:09.422
POSITION. THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT

07:24:09.489 --> 07:24:10.890
CRIMINALIZING INSENSITIVE

07:24:10.957 --> 07:24:12.959
BEHAVIOR. IT TARGETS A VERY

07:24:13.026 --> 07:24:15.962
SPECIFIC AND SERIOUS PATTERN

07:24:16.029 --> 07:24:17.764
MALICIOUS, WILLFUL, AND REPEATED

07:24:17.831 --> 07:24:18.932
HARASSMENT THAT INCLUDES

07:24:18.999 --> 07:24:20.266
CREDIBLE THREATS AGAINST THE

07:24:20.333 --> 07:24:22.002
VICTIM'S ANIMAL. THIS CONDUCT IS

07:24:22.068 --> 07:24:24.537
NOT RELATIVELY MINOR. IT IS A

07:24:24.604 --> 07:24:26.072
CALCULATED AND TRAUMATIZING, AND

07:24:26.139 --> 07:24:27.841
IT EXPLOITS A KNOWN LEGAL

07:24:27.907 --> 07:24:29.909
LOOPHOLE. WE URGE THE COMMITTEE

07:24:29.976 --> 07:24:31.411
TO RECOGNIZE THAT THREATS TO OUR

07:24:31.478 --> 07:24:32.879
ANIMALS ARE THREATS TO OUR

07:24:32.946 --> 07:24:34.614
SAFETY AND WELL-BEING. THE LAW

07:24:34.681 --> 07:24:36.649
SHOULD REFLECT THIS REALITY. AND

07:24:36.716 --> 07:24:38.284
WITH THAT, I RESPECTFULLY ASK

07:24:38.351 --> 07:24:40.053
FOR YOUR VOTE. GOOD AFTERNOON,

07:24:40.120 --> 07:24:41.454
MR. CHAIR, AND MEMBERS OF THE

07:24:41.521 --> 07:24:42.622
COMMITTEE, ROBERT BROWN OF THE

07:24:42.689 --> 07:24:43.957
SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY DISTRICT

07:24:44.024 --> 07:24:45.191
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, AND ON BEHALF

07:24:45.258 --> 07:24:46.693
OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT

07:24:46.760 --> 07:24:47.560
ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION ON THIS

07:24:47.627 --> 07:24:49.362
BILL. I'M ALSO HERE ON BEHALF OF

07:24:49.429 --> 07:24:50.864
THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY DISTRICT

07:24:50.930 --> 07:24:52.165
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AS A COSPONSOR

07:24:52.232 --> 07:24:54.968
ON THE BILL. FORGIVE ME, I HAVE

07:24:55.035 --> 07:24:56.970
TO USE BEN FRANKLIN TO HELP ME

07:24:57.037 --> 07:24:58.271
WITH TECHNOLOGY HERE. STALKING

07:24:58.338 --> 07:24:59.739
IS A CRIME ABOUT CONTROL. A

07:24:59.806 --> 07:25:01.007
STALKER INAPPROPRIATELY FIXATES

07:25:01.074 --> 07:25:01.975
ON THE TARGET OF THEIR

07:25:02.042 --> 07:25:03.476
OBSESSION, DRIVEN BY AN IMAGINED

07:25:03.543 --> 07:25:05.278
LOVE AND FANTASIES OF A FUTURE

07:25:05.345 --> 07:25:06.713
TOGETHER. BUT WHEN THE STALKER

07:25:06.780 --> 07:25:07.881
REALIZES THAT THIS FUTURE ISN'T

07:25:07.947 --> 07:25:09.582
GOING TO HAPPEN, THEY ENTER A

07:25:09.649 --> 07:25:10.316
DEVALUATION STAGE WHERE THEY

07:25:10.383 --> 07:25:12.152
SEEK TO PUNISH AND ISOLATE. THE

07:25:12.218 --> 07:25:13.453
VICTIM MENTALITY IS, IF I CAN'T

07:25:13.520 --> 07:25:15.789
HAVE YOU, NO ONE CAN. SO STALKER

07:25:15.855 --> 07:25:17.590
SEEKS TO ROB THE VICTIM OF ANY

07:25:17.657 --> 07:25:18.625
COMFORT OR LOVE THAT COMES FROM

07:25:18.691 --> 07:25:20.994
ANYONE ELSE. WHO CAN WE TURN TO

07:25:21.061 --> 07:25:21.628
FOR UNCONDITIONAL LOVE? WHO IS

07:25:21.694 --> 07:25:23.430
ALWAYS HAPPY TO SEE US FIRST

07:25:23.496 --> 07:25:24.764
THING IN THE MORNING OR AFTER A

07:25:24.831 --> 07:25:26.499
LONG DAY AT WORK. OUR BELOVED

07:25:26.566 --> 07:25:27.434
ANIMAL COMPANIONS, OUR FURRY

07:25:27.500 --> 07:25:30.070
FAMILY MEMBERS. AND FOR THIS

07:25:30.136 --> 07:25:30.703
REASON, STALKERS OFTEN TARGET

07:25:30.770 --> 07:25:31.371
PETS OF THEIR VICTIMS. CONSIDER

07:25:31.438 --> 07:25:32.305
18 YEAR OLD BRIANNA FROM

07:25:32.372 --> 07:25:33.440
RIVERSIDE COUNTY. HER STALKER

07:25:33.506 --> 07:25:34.240
ENTERED THE DEVALUATION STAGE

07:25:34.307 --> 07:25:35.642
AND THREATENED TO TAKE HER

07:25:35.708 --> 07:25:36.943
BELOVED KITTEN, WALLY, AND SKIN

07:25:37.010 --> 07:25:38.945
HIM ALIVE. UNDER CURRENT LAW,

07:25:39.012 --> 07:25:39.979
THAT THREAT COULD NOT BE

07:25:40.046 --> 07:25:41.114
CONSIDERED PART OF STALKING

07:25:41.181 --> 07:25:42.549
BECAUSE WALLY IS A FURRY FAMILY

07:25:42.615 --> 07:25:44.484
MEMBER AND NOT A HUMAN FAMILY

07:25:44.551 --> 07:25:45.952
MEMBER. WALLY WAS. IF THE LAW

07:25:46.019 --> 07:25:47.654
HAD RECOGNIZED THIS STALKING,

07:25:47.720 --> 07:25:49.222
LAW ENFORCEMENT COULD HAVE

07:25:49.289 --> 07:25:50.623
INTERVENED. HER STORY COULD HAVE

07:25:50.690 --> 07:25:52.092
ENDED DIFFERENTLY. BUT IT

07:25:52.158 --> 07:25:52.725
DIDN'T, SIMPLY BECAUSE THE LAW

07:25:52.792 --> 07:25:54.928
DOES NOT RECOGNIZE PETS AND PC

07:25:54.994 --> 07:25:57.297
640 6.9 THAT DISTINCTION DIDN'T

07:25:57.363 --> 07:25:58.565
STOP WITH BRIANNA'S STALKER. A

07:25:58.631 --> 07:26:00.233
FEW DAYS LATER, HER SWEET KITTEN

07:26:00.300 --> 07:26:01.468
WALLY WAS KIDNAPED BY THE

07:26:01.534 --> 07:26:02.869
STALKER AND USED TO LURE BRIANNA

07:26:02.936 --> 07:26:05.371
TO A FIELD WHERE SHE FOUND HER

07:26:05.438 --> 07:26:06.406
BELOVED PET DEAD. SADLY, BRIANNA

07:26:06.473 --> 07:26:07.707
IS FAR FROM ALONE IN HER

07:26:07.774 --> 07:26:08.475
EXPERIENCE. UNDER THE CURRENT

07:26:08.541 --> 07:26:10.810
LAW, WE HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE

07:26:10.877 --> 07:26:11.744
ANIMAL IS TAKEN OR KILLED, I.E.

07:26:11.811 --> 07:26:13.413
THE ANIMAL IS VICTIMIZED, TO

07:26:13.480 --> 07:26:14.514
CONSIDER THE CONDUCT CRIMINAL,

07:26:14.581 --> 07:26:15.815
AND EVEN THEN IT'S DEFINED AS

07:26:15.882 --> 07:26:17.217
THEFT OR ANIMAL CRUELTY. LET'S

07:26:17.283 --> 07:26:20.320
CALL IT WHAT IT IS. IT SHOULD BE

07:26:20.386 --> 07:26:21.020
STALKING. LET'S RECOGNIZE THE

07:26:21.087 --> 07:26:22.255
CRIME AGAINST THE HUMAN HERE,

07:26:22.322 --> 07:26:24.524
AND LET'S NOT WAIT UNTIL A PET

07:26:24.591 --> 07:26:25.325
IS TAKEN OR KILLED. IN CASES

07:26:25.391 --> 07:26:26.593
LIKE BRIANNA'S, WE ARE MISSING A

07:26:26.659 --> 07:26:27.760
GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY TO INTERVENE

07:26:27.827 --> 07:26:29.562
BEFORE A TRAGEDY OCCURS. ALL IT

07:26:29.629 --> 07:26:31.364
TAKES TO CHANGE THAT IS THE

07:26:31.431 --> 07:26:33.366
RECOGNITION THAT PETS ARE LIKE

07:26:33.433 --> 07:26:34.200
FAMILY AND CAN BE EQUALLY

07:26:34.267 --> 07:26:35.969
EFFECTIVE. TOOL. TOOL STALKERS

07:26:36.035 --> 07:26:37.871
TO USE STALKERS USED TO TORMENT

07:26:37.937 --> 07:26:39.172
THEIR VICTIMS. WE RESPECTFULLY

07:26:39.239 --> 07:26:41.441
ASK FOR YOUR VOTE ON SB 221 TO

07:26:41.508 --> 07:26:42.609
GIVE PROTECTION TO THE MOST

07:26:42.675 --> 07:26:44.010
INNOCENT AND VULNERABLE VICTIMS

07:26:44.077 --> 07:26:44.811
OF STALKING BEHAVIOR, AND ENSURE

07:26:44.878 --> 07:26:46.279
THAT PERPETRATORS OF THIS CRIME

07:26:46.346 --> 07:26:47.614
ARE HELD FULLY RESPONSIBLE. AND

07:26:47.680 --> 07:26:50.183
ON A PERSONAL NOTE, I WOULD LIKE

07:26:50.250 --> 07:26:51.618
TO SAY THAT THIS KIND OF A CRIME

07:26:51.684 --> 07:26:53.653
HAS JUST BEEN DESCRIBED AS AN

07:26:53.720 --> 07:26:54.354
ABERRATION. IT IS NOT. IT

07:26:54.420 --> 07:26:55.555
DOESN'T TAKE VERY LONG AS A

07:26:55.622 --> 07:26:57.190
PROSECUTOR TO ENCOUNTER ONE OF

07:26:57.257 --> 07:26:58.925
THESE CASES. I HAVE SEEN

07:26:58.992 --> 07:26:59.792
MULTIPLE CASES WHERE A KITTEN OR

07:26:59.859 --> 07:27:02.028
A DOG OR A PUPPY HAS BEEN ABUSED

07:27:02.095 --> 07:27:04.564
OR THREATENED WITH ABUSE SO THAT

07:27:04.631 --> 07:27:06.266
THE STALKER CAN EXERT SOME SORT

07:27:06.332 --> 07:27:08.368
OF OBSESSIVE CONTROL OVER THE

07:27:08.434 --> 07:27:10.904
VICTIM IN THE CASE. I THINK MANY

07:27:10.970 --> 07:27:13.406
OF US ARE IN PUBLIC SERVICE

07:27:13.473 --> 07:27:14.374
BECAUSE WE DON'T LIKE BULLIES.

07:27:14.440 --> 07:27:15.208
I'VE HEARD THAT HERE TODAY MANY

07:27:15.275 --> 07:27:17.310
TIMES. I THINK THAT I'VE ALSO

07:27:17.377 --> 07:27:18.611
HEARD SOME WORDS OF WISDOM THAT

07:27:18.678 --> 07:27:21.314
NO ONE SHOULD LIVE IN FEAR. AND

07:27:21.381 --> 07:27:21.915
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT KIND OF

07:27:21.981 --> 07:27:23.550
THING THAT THIS BEHAVIOR

07:27:23.616 --> 07:27:26.186
INSTILLS IN THE VICTIM. AND SO I

07:27:26.252 --> 07:27:27.220
REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK

07:27:27.287 --> 07:27:28.454
YOU. WELL, THANK YOU, SENATOR,

07:27:28.521 --> 07:27:30.089
FOR THE PRESENTATION. THANK YOU

07:27:30.156 --> 07:27:32.492
TO BOTH OF OUR WITNESSES. VERY

07:27:32.559 --> 07:27:33.326
QUICK PROGRAMING NOTE WE'RE

07:27:33.393 --> 07:27:34.794
GOING TO PROCEED ON WITH THIS

07:27:34.861 --> 07:27:36.563
HEARING. WE ARE UNABLE TO USE

07:27:36.629 --> 07:27:37.830
THE ROOM ACROSS THE WAY.

07:27:37.897 --> 07:27:39.265
ASSEMBLY, JUDICIARY STILL GOING.

07:27:39.332 --> 07:27:41.100
SO WE ARE GOING TO FINISH THIS

07:27:41.167 --> 07:27:41.935
BILL TO MY COLLEAGUES. WE'RE

07:27:42.001 --> 07:27:43.469
THEN GOING TO DO CONSENT AND ADD

07:27:43.536 --> 07:27:45.438
ONS BECAUSE WE MAY BE LOSING

07:27:45.505 --> 07:27:47.207
MEMBERS FOR THE REST OF THE DAY.

07:27:47.273 --> 07:27:49.576
WE ARE THEN GOING TO HAVE TO

07:27:49.642 --> 07:27:50.443
STAND IN RECESS UNTIL WE GET

07:27:50.510 --> 07:27:51.711
THIS ROOM BACK, WHICH WILL BE

07:27:51.778 --> 07:27:53.379
UPON CONCLUSION OF VETERAN AND

07:27:53.446 --> 07:27:54.814
MILITARY, WHICH IS GOING TO BE

07:27:54.881 --> 07:27:55.415
ROUGHLY FIVE 5:30 P.M. SO IF

07:27:55.481 --> 07:27:57.584
YOU'RE HERE WAITING FOR ANY

07:27:57.650 --> 07:27:59.385
OTHER BILL, I AM VERY SORRY, BUT

07:27:59.452 --> 07:28:00.386
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BREAK

07:28:00.453 --> 07:28:02.322
AFTER THIS HEARING AND WAIT TO

07:28:02.388 --> 07:28:03.323
GET THE ROOM BACK. WITH THAT

07:28:03.389 --> 07:28:04.857
SAID, I'LL GO OVER ALL THAT

07:28:04.924 --> 07:28:06.559
AGAIN IN A FEW MINUTES. WE'RE

07:28:06.626 --> 07:28:08.828

RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION

07:28:30.016 --> 07:28:31.150
HERE HOPING TO TESTIFY IN

07:28:31.217 --> 07:28:33.486

MOTION AND A SECOND. WE'RE STILL

07:28:39.225 --> 07:28:40.526
GOING TO LET THEM TESTIFY, MR.

07:28:40.593 --> 07:28:42.428
VICE CHAIR. HE KNOWS THAT. I'M

07:28:42.495 --> 07:28:44.764
JUST GIVING HIM A HARD TIME. YOU

07:28:44.831 --> 07:28:45.465
GUYS WILL HAVE FIVE MINUTES. YOU

07:28:45.531 --> 07:28:48.201
KNOW THE DRILL. AND IF YOU'RE A.

07:28:48.268 --> 07:28:49.669
ME, TOO. FOR THIS BILL, IF YOU

07:28:49.736 --> 07:28:50.837
WANT TO START LINING UP WHILE

07:28:50.903 --> 07:28:51.804
THEY'RE TESTIFYING RIGHT AGAINST

07:28:51.871 --> 07:28:52.972
THAT WALL RIGHT THERE, WE'LL

07:28:53.039 --> 07:28:54.674
TAKE YOU RIGHT AFTER. GO AHEAD.

07:28:54.741 --> 07:28:55.942
CHAIR MEMBERS, MY NAME IS AUBREY

07:28:56.009 --> 07:28:57.610
RODRIGUEZ, AND I'M A LEGISLATIVE

07:28:57.677 --> 07:28:59.212
ADVOCATE WITH ACLU CALIFORNIA

07:28:59.279 --> 07:29:01.714
ACTION. OUR ORGANIZATION IS IN

07:29:01.781 --> 07:29:03.483
OPPOSITION TO SB 221, WHICH

07:29:03.549 --> 07:29:04.684
WOULD GREATLY EXPAND THE

07:29:04.751 --> 07:29:06.452
DEFINITION OF WHAT CONSTITUTES

07:29:06.519 --> 07:29:08.288
STALKING, A CRIME THAT CARRIES

07:29:08.354 --> 07:29:09.389
WITH IT A PUNISHMENT BETWEEN 1

07:29:09.455 --> 07:29:11.624
AND 5 YEARS IN PRISON. THE ACLU

07:29:11.691 --> 07:29:12.925
IS CONCERNED THAT BROADENING

07:29:12.992 --> 07:29:14.160
BROADENING THE LANGUAGE COULD

07:29:14.227 --> 07:29:16.162
LEAD TO THE CRIMINALIZATION OF

07:29:16.229 --> 07:29:17.930
ACTIONS THAT, WHILE INSENSITIVE

07:29:17.997 --> 07:29:20.433
OR UNWELCOME, DO NOT RISE TO THE

07:29:20.500 --> 07:29:22.335
LEVEL OF STALKING AND WARRANT

07:29:22.402 --> 07:29:23.736
IMPRISONMENT. CRIMINALIZING

07:29:23.803 --> 07:29:25.138
BEHAVIOR THAT IS INSENSITIVE IS

07:29:25.204 --> 07:29:26.906
NOT ONLY IMPRACTICAL, BUT

07:29:26.973 --> 07:29:30.310
DANGEROUS. CRIMINALIZATION.

07:29:30.376 --> 07:29:31.277
OVERCRIMINALIZATION EXACERBATES

07:29:31.344 --> 07:29:32.745
EXISTING RACIAL AND ECONOMIC

07:29:32.812 --> 07:29:33.446
DISPARITIES IN THE JUSTICE

07:29:33.513 --> 07:29:34.914
SYSTEM, WHILE ALSO

07:29:34.981 --> 07:29:36.282
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTING

07:29:36.349 --> 07:29:37.550
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE LOW INCOME

07:29:37.617 --> 07:29:39.352
AND UNABLE TO AFFORD LEGAL

07:29:39.419 --> 07:29:41.054
REPRESENTATION OR PAY FINES.

07:29:41.120 --> 07:29:42.855
THIS EXPANSION OF CRIMINAL

07:29:42.922 --> 07:29:44.757
ACTIVITY CAN ENSNARE INDIVIDUALS

07:29:44.824 --> 07:29:46.359
IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

07:29:46.426 --> 07:29:47.527
FOR RELATIVELY MINOR

07:29:47.593 --> 07:29:48.628
INFRACTIONS, LEADING TO LONG

07:29:48.695 --> 07:29:50.463
TERM CONSEQUENCES SUCH AS LOSS

07:29:50.530 --> 07:29:52.098
OF EMPLOYMENT, HOUSING, AND

07:29:52.165 --> 07:29:55.034
CIVIL LIBERTIES. AS ADVOCATES

07:29:55.101 --> 07:29:56.202
FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO DO NOT

07:29:56.269 --> 07:29:58.204
HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF ADDRESSING

07:29:58.271 --> 07:29:58.971
POLICYMAKERS DIRECTLY, WE ASK

07:29:59.038 --> 07:30:01.174
YOU TO BE MINDFUL OF THESE

07:30:01.240 --> 07:30:02.208
IMPACTS WHEN CONSIDERING

07:30:02.275 --> 07:30:03.743
LEGISLATION THAT SEEKS TO EXPAND

07:30:03.810 --> 07:30:05.144
CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR

07:30:05.211 --> 07:30:07.213
NONVIOLENT OFFENSES. LASTLY, IT

07:30:07.280 --> 07:30:08.848
IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT

07:30:08.915 --> 07:30:10.583
EXISTING LAW ALREADY PROVIDES

07:30:10.650 --> 07:30:11.617
PROTECTIONS TO ANIMALS UNDER THE

07:30:11.684 --> 07:30:13.386
ANIMAL CRUELTY LAWS AT THE STATE

07:30:13.453 --> 07:30:15.755
AND FEDERAL LEVEL. AND AS NOTED

07:30:15.822 --> 07:30:17.290
IN THE SENATE PUBLIC SAFETY

07:30:17.357 --> 07:30:19.492
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS, A PROSECUTOR

07:30:19.559 --> 07:30:21.627
CAN CURRENTLY ALREADY ARGUE THAT

07:30:21.694 --> 07:30:24.097
ANY PERSON WHO REASONABLY FEARS

07:30:24.163 --> 07:30:26.399
FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY IF THE

07:30:26.466 --> 07:30:27.867
PERPETRATOR WAS THREATENING A

07:30:27.934 --> 07:30:28.935
PERSON'S PET, IN ADDITION TO

07:30:29.001 --> 07:30:29.836
COMMITTING OTHER HARASSING OR

07:30:29.902 --> 07:30:31.170
THREATENING BEHAVIOR AGAINST

07:30:31.237 --> 07:30:34.240
THAT PERSON, CAN PROSECUTE THEM,

07:30:34.307 --> 07:30:36.409
WHICH IS WHY THE SENATE ANALYSIS

07:30:36.476 --> 07:30:37.977
DOES APTLY, STATE MAKES THIS

07:30:38.044 --> 07:30:40.113
BILL ENTIRELY UNNECESSARY. FOR

07:30:40.179 --> 07:30:41.814
THESE REASONS, WE DO URGE YOUR

07:30:41.881 --> 07:30:44.250
NO VOTE ON SB 221 AND

07:30:44.317 --> 07:30:44.884
RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL.

07:30:44.951 --> 07:30:48.354
THANK YOU. HELLO, MR. CHAIR AND

07:30:48.421 --> 07:30:49.822
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY

07:30:49.889 --> 07:30:50.656
NAME IS ELIZABETH KIM, THE

07:30:50.723 --> 07:30:52.592
POLICY DIRECTOR AT INITIATE

07:30:52.658 --> 07:30:54.594
JUSTICE. I'M A LAWYER. I SERVED

07:30:54.660 --> 07:30:56.295
AT THE DOJ AND AN EDUCATOR WHO

07:30:56.362 --> 07:30:57.563
HAS TAUGHT INSIDE LEVEL THREE

07:30:57.630 --> 07:30:59.165
AND FOUR CALIFORNIA STATE

07:30:59.232 --> 07:31:01.000
PRISONS. I'VE ALSO PERSONALLY

07:31:01.067 --> 07:31:03.836
WORKED ON DV CASES, AND I'VE

07:31:03.903 --> 07:31:05.004
PERSONALLY BEEN A VICTIM OF

07:31:05.071 --> 07:31:06.406
STALKING CASES MYSELF. AND I'M

07:31:06.472 --> 07:31:08.908
ALSO A PET PROUD PET OWNER, AND

07:31:08.975 --> 07:31:10.209
I UNDERSTAND THE EMOTIONAL HARM

07:31:10.276 --> 07:31:12.879
INVOLVED HERE. I'M HERE TODAY TO

07:31:12.945 --> 07:31:15.047
RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SB 221. I'M

07:31:15.114 --> 07:31:17.150
GOING TO GO OVER FOUR QUICK

07:31:17.216 --> 07:31:19.318
POINTS. THE FIRST, AS MY

07:31:19.385 --> 07:31:21.521
COLLEAGUE STATED, THE REDUNDANCY

07:31:21.587 --> 07:31:23.756
TOOLS ALREADY EXIST. WE ALREADY

07:31:23.823 --> 07:31:24.791
HAVE LAWS THAT PROTECT PEOPLE.

07:31:24.857 --> 07:31:27.193
IN THESE CASES. THE DVR CASES

07:31:27.260 --> 07:31:28.995
ALLOW FOR PETS TO BE INCLUDED IN

07:31:29.061 --> 07:31:31.297
PROTECTIVE ORDERS AND VANDALISM

07:31:31.364 --> 07:31:33.065
LAWS, AS WELL AS CURRENT

07:31:33.132 --> 07:31:33.833
STALKING STATUTES. THIS BILL

07:31:33.900 --> 07:31:36.536
DOES NOT FILL THAT GAP, NOR DOES

07:31:36.602 --> 07:31:39.539
IT PROVIDE CLARITY. THERE IS A

07:31:39.605 --> 07:31:40.873
LEGAL AMBIGUITY HERE, AND

07:31:40.940 --> 07:31:42.909
UNEQUAL ENFORCEMENT WOULD

07:31:42.975 --> 07:31:44.610
RESULT. SO WHAT COUNTS AS A

07:31:44.677 --> 07:31:45.678
CREDIBLE THREAT TO AN EMOTIONAL

07:31:45.745 --> 07:31:47.046
SUPPORT ANIMAL? THERE IS NO

07:31:47.113 --> 07:31:49.215
CLEAR STANDARD, SO WITHOUT

07:31:49.282 --> 07:31:50.516
DEFINITIONS, ENFORCEMENT WILL

07:31:50.583 --> 07:31:52.418
VARY WILDLY BY COUNTY, BY

07:31:52.485 --> 07:31:54.954
OFFICER, BY BIAS. THAT'S DUE

07:31:55.021 --> 07:31:56.456
PROCESS. THAT'S A DUE PROCESS

07:31:56.522 --> 07:31:58.090
PROBLEM AND A SET UP FOR UNEVEN

07:31:58.157 --> 07:31:59.992
JUSTICE. THIRDLY, THERE'S A

07:32:00.059 --> 07:32:02.462
FISCAL IMPACT WHERE THERE'S AN

07:32:02.528 --> 07:32:04.464
UNFUNDED MANDATE HERE. THIS BILL

07:32:04.530 --> 07:32:05.665
WOULD EXPAND THE STALKING

07:32:05.731 --> 07:32:07.233
STATUTE WITHOUT ADDING

07:32:07.300 --> 07:32:09.302
RESOURCES, CREATING AN UNFUNDED

07:32:09.368 --> 07:32:11.904
MANDATE. MY LEGAL EXPERIENCE HAS

07:32:11.971 --> 07:32:14.006
EXPOSED ME TO HOW THESE KINDS OF

07:32:14.073 --> 07:32:15.408
EXPANSIONS STRAIN OUR COURT

07:32:15.475 --> 07:32:17.276
SYSTEM AND PULL RESOURCES AWAY

07:32:17.343 --> 07:32:19.479
FROM HIGHER PRIORITY THREATS.

07:32:19.545 --> 07:32:20.813
LASTLY, THERE IS NO PROVEN

07:32:20.880 --> 07:32:22.415
SAFETY BENEFIT THAT'S PROVEN.

07:32:22.482 --> 07:32:24.150
THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF

07:32:24.217 --> 07:32:26.252
JUSTICE AND BUREAU OF JUSTICE

07:32:26.319 --> 07:32:27.653
STATISTICS HAVE SHOWN TIME AND

07:32:27.720 --> 07:32:30.089
TIME AGAIN, HARSHER PENALTIES DO

07:32:30.156 --> 07:32:32.725
NOT DETER CRIME. WHAT WE WOULD

07:32:32.792 --> 07:32:35.595
LIKE TO SEE IS SUPPORT SERVICES,

07:32:35.661 --> 07:32:36.929
CONSISTENCY AND ENFORCEMENT,

07:32:36.996 --> 07:32:38.865
TRAUMA INFORMED APPROACHES AND

07:32:38.931 --> 07:32:40.967
INVESTMENT INTO PREVENTING

07:32:41.033 --> 07:32:42.435
MEASURES SO THAT OUR PETS ARE

07:32:42.502 --> 07:32:44.470
SAFE. WHAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE ARE

07:32:44.537 --> 07:32:45.404
BETTER ALTERNATIVES, AND I'D

07:32:45.471 --> 07:32:47.874
LIKE TO CLOSE WITH THIS INSTEAD

07:32:47.940 --> 07:32:50.076
OF EXPANDING ON A DEFINITION OR

07:32:50.142 --> 07:32:51.511
A STATUTE, LET'S TRAIN AND WORK

07:32:51.577 --> 07:32:53.045
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT ON HOW TO

07:32:53.112 --> 07:32:54.647
USE THE TOOLS WE ALREADY HAVE.

07:32:54.714 --> 07:32:56.983
AND LET'S INVEST IN SERVICES FOR

07:32:57.049 --> 07:32:58.584
VICTIMS TO PREVENT THESE CRIMES

07:32:58.651 --> 07:33:00.086
FROM HAPPENING, NOT BUILD

07:33:00.152 --> 07:33:02.622
BROADER STATUTES WITH UNINTENDED

07:33:02.688 --> 07:33:03.523
CONSEQUENCES. AND AS SOMEONE

07:33:03.589 --> 07:33:04.991
WHO'S WORKED ON BOTH POLICY AND

07:33:05.057 --> 07:33:06.259
THE FRONTLINES AND WHO LOVE

07:33:06.325 --> 07:33:09.428
PETS, I URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON

07:33:09.495 --> 07:33:13.866
SB 221. THANK YOU. FIVE MINUTES.

07:33:13.933 --> 07:33:16.269
SURE ABOUT 30S, BUT GO FOR IT

07:33:16.335 --> 07:33:18.471
THEN. I JUST WANT TO SAY AND ON

07:33:18.538 --> 07:33:19.639
PAGE THREE OF THE ANALYSIS, IT

07:33:19.705 --> 07:33:21.607
DOES STATE IT IS ARGUABLE UNDER

07:33:21.674 --> 07:33:22.909
CALIFORNIA STATUTE THAT IF A

07:33:22.975 --> 07:33:24.710
PERSON THREATENS A PET WITH HARM

07:33:24.777 --> 07:33:26.045
AND MAY STILL CONSTITUTE

07:33:26.112 --> 07:33:27.513
STALKING BECAUSE THERE IS A

07:33:27.580 --> 07:33:28.648
CREDIBLE REASON TO THINK THE

07:33:28.714 --> 07:33:30.616
HARM WILL ESCALATE TO A PERSON,

07:33:30.683 --> 07:33:32.218
WHICH AGAIN MAKES THIS BILL

07:33:32.285 --> 07:33:33.753
UNNECESSARY. THANK YOU. THANK

07:33:33.819 --> 07:33:35.721
YOU BOTH VERY MUCH. ANY OTHER

07:33:35.788 --> 07:33:36.822
METOOS? ANYONE ELSE HOPING TO BE

07:33:36.889 --> 07:33:38.758
HEARD ON THE BILL? OKAY, WE'LL

07:33:38.824 --> 07:33:40.459
TURN IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE.

07:33:40.526 --> 07:33:41.427
WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A

07:33:41.494 --> 07:33:43.529
SECOND. I'LL JUST NOTE. ARE

07:33:43.596 --> 07:33:44.564
THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS

07:33:44.630 --> 07:33:45.831
FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS? I ONLY

07:33:45.898 --> 07:33:47.333
HAVE ONE QUESTION, I BELIEVE,

07:33:47.400 --> 07:33:49.368
MR. BROWN. CORRECT. FROM CDVA,

07:33:49.435 --> 07:33:50.770
YOU'VE HEARD THE SKEPTICISM THAT

07:33:50.836 --> 07:33:52.972
THE BILL IS UNNECESSARY AND

07:33:53.039 --> 07:33:55.107
DUPLICATIVE OF PREVIOUSLY STATED

07:33:55.174 --> 07:33:56.108
LAW. WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE?

07:33:56.175 --> 07:33:57.376
WHAT'S THE POSITION OF CDA?

07:33:57.443 --> 07:33:59.478
WELL, THEN I WONDER WHY THE

07:33:59.545 --> 07:34:00.947
OTHER ARGUMENTS ARE MADE IF

07:34:01.013 --> 07:34:01.514
THAT'S THE CASE. BUT I ALSO

07:34:01.581 --> 07:34:04.450
THINK THAT IF APPELLATE COURTS

07:34:04.517 --> 07:34:05.885
OFTEN LOOK TO THE PLAIN LANGUAGE

07:34:05.952 --> 07:34:08.120
OF A LAW, AND WHAT I HEARD MY

07:34:08.187 --> 07:34:10.690
COLLEAGUE HERE SAY IS THAT IT IS

07:34:10.756 --> 07:34:12.091
ARGUABLE THAT MEANS THERE IS

07:34:12.158 --> 07:34:13.326
AMBIGUITY THAT NEEDS TO BE

07:34:13.392 --> 07:34:14.794
RESOLVED THAT COULD BE PLACED IN

07:34:14.860 --> 07:34:17.663
FRONT OF A JURY, AND THEY WON'T

07:34:17.730 --> 07:34:19.699
KNOW THE ANSWER. IF YOU HAVE IT

07:34:19.765 --> 07:34:20.299
EXPLICITLY IN THE STATUTE, IT

07:34:20.366 --> 07:34:20.900
WILL REMOVE ANY QUESTION THAT

07:34:20.967 --> 07:34:23.302
THREATENING THE HARM TO THAT PET

THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WHO

08:04:10.154 --> 08:04:12.356
APPOINTED THEM THE AT WILL

08:04:12.423 --> 08:04:14.759
EMPLOYMENT STATUS THAT'S CURRENT

08:04:14.825 --> 08:04:17.428
STATE OF AFFAIRS HAS LED TO THE

08:04:17.495 --> 08:04:18.496
FEAR OF TERMINATION BY PUBLIC

08:04:18.562 --> 08:04:19.897
DEFENDERS, WHO HAVE TAKEN UP

08:04:19.964 --> 08:04:21.766
CONTROVERSIAL CAUSES WHICH CAN

08:04:21.832 --> 08:04:23.200
INTERFERE WITH THEIR ABILITY TO

08:04:23.267 --> 08:04:24.335
ADEQUATELY FIGHT FOR THEIR

08:04:24.402 --> 08:04:26.237
CLIENTS. CHIEF PUBLIC DEFENDERS

08:04:26.303 --> 08:04:28.105
PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN ENSURING

08:04:28.172 --> 08:04:29.707
A FAIR AND EQUITABLE JUSTICE

08:04:29.774 --> 08:04:31.142
SYSTEM. THEY UPHOLD THE

08:04:31.208 --> 08:04:32.243
CONSTITUTION BY GUARANTEEING

08:04:32.309 --> 08:04:33.677
ACCESS TO DUE PROCESS FOR ALL,

08:04:33.744 --> 08:04:35.479
REGARDLESS OF FINANCIAL STATUS,

08:04:35.546 --> 08:04:37.581
AND BY ELIMINATING THE AT WILL

08:04:37.648 --> 08:04:40.518
STATUS. OF THESE OFFICIALS, SB

08:04:40.584 --> 08:04:41.886

08:04:41.952 --> 08:04:43.120
INDEPENDENCE AND ALLOW THEM TO

08:04:43.187 --> 08:04:44.455
SERVE WITH INTEGRITY. I

08:04:44.522 --> 08:04:46.257
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE

08:04:46.323 --> 08:04:47.591
WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IS

08:04:47.658 --> 08:04:49.894
REBECCA MARCOS. REBECCA MARCUS.

08:04:49.960 --> 08:04:51.962
EXCUSE ME, FROM THE CALIFORNIA

08:04:52.029 --> 08:04:54.465
PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION.

08:04:54.532 --> 08:04:55.733
GOOD AFTERNOON, CHAIR MEMBERS.

08:04:55.800 --> 08:04:57.101
MY NAME IS REBECCA MARCUS, AND I

08:04:57.168 --> 08:04:58.502
REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC

08:04:58.569 --> 08:05:01.338
DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION. SB 485

08:05:01.405 --> 08:05:02.406
STRENGTHENS THE INTEGRITY OF

08:05:02.473 --> 08:05:03.607
PUBLIC DEFENSE BY PROTECTING

08:05:03.674 --> 08:05:04.542
PUBLIC DEFENDERS FROM

08:05:04.608 --> 08:05:06.343
POLITICALLY MOTIVATED DISMISSAL.

08:05:06.410 --> 08:05:07.812
PUBLIC DEFENDERS ARE ESSENTIAL

08:05:07.878 --> 08:05:09.580
TO A FUNCTIONING JUSTICE SYSTEM.

08:05:09.647 --> 08:05:11.081
THEY ENSURE THAT NO ONE FACES

08:05:11.148 --> 08:05:13.217
THE POWER OF THE STATE ALONE,

08:05:13.284 --> 08:05:14.285
THAT THE CONSTITUTION, THE

08:05:14.351 --> 08:05:15.319
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO COUNSEL,

08:05:15.386 --> 08:05:17.121
IS NOT JUST THEORETICAL, BUT

08:05:17.188 --> 08:05:18.556
REAL AND ACCESSIBLE. NO MATTER

08:05:18.622 --> 08:05:20.791
YOUR INCOME OR BACKGROUND. YET

08:05:20.858 --> 08:05:22.293
UNDER CURRENT LAW, IN MOST

08:05:22.359 --> 08:05:23.360
COUNTIES, PUBLIC DEFENDERS CAN

08:05:23.427 --> 08:05:25.429
BE FIRED AT WILL BY THE BOARD OF

08:05:25.496 --> 08:05:26.530
SUPERVISORS, EVEN FOR REASONS

08:05:26.597 --> 08:05:28.265
ENTIRELY UNRELATED TO MISCONDUCT

08:05:28.332 --> 08:05:30.201
OR POOR MANAGEMENT. THAT MEANS A

08:05:30.267 --> 08:05:31.836
PUBLIC DEFENDER CAN BE REMOVED

08:05:31.902 --> 08:05:33.137
SIMPLY BY STANDING UP TO LAW

08:05:33.204 --> 08:05:35.239
ENFORCEMENT ABUSES, DEFENDING AN

08:05:35.306 --> 08:05:36.941
UNPOPULAR CLIENT, OR CHALLENGING

08:05:37.007 --> 08:05:38.742
SYSTEMIC INJUSTICE EXACTLY WHAT

08:05:38.809 --> 08:05:40.077
WE EXPECT THEM TO DO AND WHAT

08:05:40.144 --> 08:05:42.079
THE CONSTITUTION DEMANDS. THIS

08:05:42.146 --> 08:05:43.414
BILL DOESN'T INSULATE DEFENDERS

08:05:43.481 --> 08:05:44.882
FROM ACCOUNTABILITY. IT SIMPLY

08:05:44.949 --> 08:05:46.217
REQUIRES THAT REMOVAL BE BASED

08:05:46.283 --> 08:05:48.118
ON GOOD CAUSE. THINGS LIKE

08:05:48.185 --> 08:05:49.987
MISCONDUCT, NEGLECT OF DUTY, OR

08:05:50.054 --> 08:05:51.755
ETHICAL VIOLATIONS, AND THAT THE

08:05:51.822 --> 08:05:53.224
DECISION BE MADE BY A 3/5 VOTE

08:05:53.290 --> 08:05:55.025
OF THE BOARD. NOW, IN MOST

08:05:55.092 --> 08:05:56.794
COUNTIES WITH FIVE SUPERVISORS,

08:05:56.861 --> 08:05:58.262
THAT'S JUST THREE VOTES, THE

08:05:58.329 --> 08:06:00.064
SAME AS A SIMPLE MAJORITY. BUT

08:06:00.130 --> 08:06:01.131
THE MEANINGFUL REFORM HERE IS

08:06:01.198 --> 08:06:03.300
THE REQUIREMENT THAT THERE BE A

08:06:03.367 --> 08:06:04.401
LEGITIMATE DOCUMENTED REASON FOR

08:06:04.468 --> 08:06:05.736
REMOVAL. THAT'S WHAT PROTECTS

08:06:05.803 --> 08:06:06.904
DEFENDERS FROM BEING OUSTED FOR

08:06:06.971 --> 08:06:08.706
DOING THEIR JOBS TOO. WELL, JUST

08:06:08.772 --> 08:06:11.242
IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS, I'VE BEEN

08:06:11.308 --> 08:06:11.909
CONFRONTED WITH TWO EXAMPLES AS

08:06:11.976 --> 08:06:13.277
TO WHY THIS BILL MUST PASS. TWO

08:06:13.344 --> 08:06:14.678
DIFFERENT PUBLIC DEFENDERS

08:06:14.745 --> 08:06:16.447
OFFICES CAME TO OUR ASSOCIATION

08:06:16.514 --> 08:06:17.748
LOOKING FOR ADVICE ON HOW TO

08:06:17.815 --> 08:06:19.350
NAVIGATE PRECARIOUS SITUATIONS

08:06:19.416 --> 08:06:20.784
WITH THEIR BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS

08:06:20.851 --> 08:06:22.019
AND ELECTED LAW ENFORCEMENT

08:06:22.086 --> 08:06:23.153
TRYING TO BALANCE THEIR

08:06:23.220 --> 08:06:24.221
CONSTITUTIONAL DUTIES TO

08:06:24.288 --> 08:06:24.989
ADVOCATE FOR THEIR CLIENTS WITH

08:06:25.055 --> 08:06:27.691
THE REAL FEAR OF RETALIATION,

08:06:27.758 --> 08:06:29.627
DISCUSSING MENTAL HEALTH

08:06:29.693 --> 08:06:32.329
DIVERSION OR ICE RAIDS AT

08:06:32.396 --> 08:06:33.964
COURTHOUSES PUT THEM AT ODDS

08:06:34.031 --> 08:06:35.533
WITH THEIR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS.

08:06:35.599 --> 08:06:37.568
AT A TIME WHEN WE'RE SEEING

08:06:37.635 --> 08:06:38.168
POLITICALLY MOTIVATED FIRINGS

08:06:38.235 --> 08:06:39.937
AND PUBLIC OFFICIALS ACROSS THE

08:06:40.004 --> 08:06:41.438
COUNTRY. CALIFORNIA MUST LEAD IN

08:06:41.505 --> 08:06:42.473
AFFIRMING THE INDEPENDENCE OF

08:06:42.540 --> 08:06:43.941
THOSE WHO SERVE THE MOST

08:06:44.008 --> 08:06:45.009
VULNERABLE IN OUR COURTS. WHEN

08:06:45.075 --> 08:06:46.510
WE PROTECT PUBLIC DEFENDERS, WE

08:06:46.577 --> 08:06:47.978
PROTECT THE RIGHT TO A FAIR

08:06:48.045 --> 08:06:49.346
TRIAL. WE PROTECT THE

08:06:49.413 --> 08:06:50.414
CONSTITUTION, AND WE PROTECT

08:06:50.481 --> 08:06:51.882
PUBLIC TRUST IN THE IDEA THAT

08:06:51.949 --> 08:06:53.751
JUSTICE DOES NOT DEPEND ON YOUR

08:06:53.817 --> 08:06:55.452
INCOME OR YOUR POLITICS. WE URGE

08:06:55.519 --> 08:06:58.088
YOUR SUPPORT FOR SB 485. THANK

OUT OF ORDER, AS WE HAVE ON

ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES, ALSO ON

BEHALF OF THE URBAN COUNTIES OF

CALIFORNIA AND THE RURAL COUNTY

08:08:09.093 --> 08:08:10.394
REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA

08:08:10.461 --> 08:08:12.029
HERE IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO

08:08:12.096 --> 08:08:14.965
SB 485. I KNOW IT'S BEEN A LONG

08:08:15.032 --> 08:08:17.568
DAY, SO I'LL KEEP IT UNDER FIVE

08:08:17.635 --> 08:08:20.070
MINUTES. EXCUSE ME, BUT FIRST, I

08:08:20.137 --> 08:08:21.739
THINK WE'D LIKE TO MAKE IT CLEAR

08:08:21.805 --> 08:08:23.307
THAT OUR POSITION IS ROOTED IN

08:08:23.374 --> 08:08:25.442
PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNANCE, GOOD

08:08:25.509 --> 08:08:26.877
GOVERNANCE, ORGANIZATIONAL

08:08:26.944 --> 08:08:29.079
CONSISTENCY AND PROCESS CLARITY.

08:08:29.146 --> 08:08:30.447
IT IS NOT ABOUT PUBLIC

08:08:30.514 --> 08:08:31.582
DEFENDERS, RATHER, IT'S ABOUT

08:08:31.649 --> 08:08:33.050
ANY NON-ELECTED, APPOINTED

08:08:33.117 --> 08:08:34.318
DEPARTMENT HEAD THAT SERVES

08:08:34.385 --> 08:08:36.220
UNDER OUR 296 COUNTY BOARDS OF

08:08:36.286 --> 08:08:38.088
SUPERVISORS THAT ARE ELECTED

08:08:38.155 --> 08:08:39.423
SECOND. IN OUR VIEW, IT'S STILL

08:08:39.490 --> 08:08:40.858
RATHER UNCLEAR AS THE TRUE

08:08:40.924 --> 08:08:43.127
NECESSITY OF THIS BILL. SPEAKING

08:08:43.193 --> 08:08:44.495
WITH COUNTY COUNCILS, THERE ARE

08:08:44.561 --> 08:08:46.296
VERY FEW EXAMPLES TO EVEN DRAW

08:08:46.363 --> 08:08:47.665
FROM WHERE THE AT-WILL BOARD

08:08:47.731 --> 08:08:49.233
AUTHORITY TO REMOVE PUBLIC

08:08:49.299 --> 08:08:50.668
DEFENDER WAS EXERCISED, AS WAS

08:08:50.734 --> 08:08:52.770
ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE AUTHORS

08:08:52.836 --> 08:08:54.171
OFFICE, AND WAS NOTED IN THE

08:08:54.238 --> 08:08:58.108
COMMITTEE. ANALYSIS. THE MOST

08:08:58.175 --> 08:09:00.377
RECENT EXAMPLE PROVIDED WAS BACK

08:09:00.444 --> 08:09:02.846
IN 1999, IN WHICH THE REMOVAL OF

08:09:02.913 --> 08:09:03.981
OFFICE WAS HANDLED LIKE ANY

08:09:04.048 --> 08:09:06.417
OTHER HIGH PROFILE EMPLOYMENT

08:09:06.483 --> 08:09:08.485
ACTION. THERE WAS ALLEGATIONS OF

08:09:08.552 --> 08:09:10.187
MISCONDUCT AND AN INVESTIGATION

08:09:10.254 --> 08:09:11.955
COMMENCED WHICH ULTIMATELY

08:09:12.022 --> 08:09:13.223
DEMONSTRATED THE ALLEGATIONS AS

08:09:13.290 --> 08:09:14.525
IT RELATES TO ETHICAL CONCERNS

08:09:14.591 --> 08:09:16.460
WERE WELL FOUNDED. THE POINT

08:09:16.527 --> 08:09:17.861
HERE IS THAT DESPITE EXISTING

08:09:17.928 --> 08:09:19.697
LAW ESTABLISHING AT-WILL STATUS

08:09:19.763 --> 08:09:21.565
OR TERMINATION FOR ANY REASON,

08:09:21.632 --> 08:09:23.500
THERE IS STILL A REMOVAL PROCESS

08:09:23.567 --> 08:09:25.502
IN PLACE, BACKED BY SOME

08:09:25.569 --> 08:09:26.670
INVESTIGATION AND DELIBERATE

08:09:26.737 --> 08:09:28.739
CONSIDERATION BY THE FULL BOARD

08:09:28.806 --> 08:09:31.375
PRIOR TO ANY BOARD ACTION. THAT

08:09:31.442 --> 08:09:33.010
SAID, THIS IS THE REASON WHY

08:09:33.077 --> 08:09:33.844
WE'RE NOT OPPOSING SOLELY BASED

08:09:33.911 --> 08:09:35.546
ON THE ELEVATED EMPLOYMENT

08:09:35.612 --> 08:09:36.880
PROTECTIONS OR THE DESIRE FOR

08:09:36.947 --> 08:09:38.782
FULL INDEPENDENCE, BUT INSTEAD

08:09:38.849 --> 08:09:39.950
PROPOSING, IN OUR VIEW,

08:09:40.017 --> 08:09:41.351
REASONABLE AMENDMENTS THAT

08:09:41.418 --> 08:09:43.087
PROVIDE ESSENTIAL CHECKS AND

08:09:43.153 --> 08:09:47.925
BALANCES. ACCORDING TO OUR TO

08:09:47.991 --> 08:09:49.259
THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS, THIS

08:09:49.326 --> 08:09:51.595
MEASURE WAS, AT LEAST IN PART,

08:09:51.662 --> 08:09:52.229
DESIGNED TO CREATE PARITY WITH

08:09:52.296 --> 08:09:53.263
EMPLOYMENT PROTECTIONS FOR

08:09:53.330 --> 08:09:55.599
COUNTY COUNCILS, AND LANGUAGE

08:09:55.666 --> 08:09:57.568
WAS DRAFTED AS SUCH, RELYING ON

08:09:57.634 --> 08:09:58.635
SPECIFIC PROVISIONS OF THE

08:09:58.702 --> 08:10:00.471
GOVERNMENT CODE FOR COUNTY

08:10:00.537 --> 08:10:02.573
COUNCIL. HOWEVER, A CRITICALLY

08:10:02.639 --> 08:10:03.907
IMPORTANT PROVISION THAT WAS

08:10:03.974 --> 08:10:06.176
OMITTED IN SB 45 WAS THE

08:10:06.243 --> 08:10:07.311
ESTABLISHMENT OF A FOUR YEAR

08:10:07.377 --> 08:10:08.912
TERM, AS IS THE CASE FOR COUNTY

08:10:08.979 --> 08:10:10.881
COUNCIL, IF THE EMPLOYMENT

08:10:10.948 --> 08:10:12.449
STATUS IS BEING CHANGED FROM

08:10:12.516 --> 08:10:14.118
AT-WILL TO ONE, IN WHICH REMOVAL

08:10:14.184 --> 08:10:16.253
MAY ONLY OCCUR BY A MAJORITY

08:19:12.122 --> 08:19:13.490
THIS DOESN'T COUNT AGAINST MY

08:19:13.556 --> 08:19:14.891
FIVE MINUTES, BUT THANK YOU FOR

08:19:14.958 --> 08:19:16.326

AMENDMENTS. MISTER CHAIR,

08:19:23.900 --> 08:19:24.901
COMMITTEE MEMBERS, WE'VE BEEN

08:19:24.968 --> 08:19:26.736
WORKING REALLY HARD ON THIS BILL

08:19:26.803 --> 08:19:27.370
THAT I'M SUPER PASSIONATE ABOUT

08:19:27.437 --> 08:19:29.205
BECAUSE IT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN

08:19:29.272 --> 08:19:31.408
MY BACKYARD AND IT'S A VERY

08:19:31.474 --> 08:19:34.711
COUNTY SPECIFIC DISTRICT. SB 357

08:19:34.778 --> 08:19:35.979
IS LOOKING TO ADDRESS THE

08:19:36.046 --> 08:19:38.214
DECADES OLD CRISIS THAT IS

08:19:38.281 --> 08:19:39.716
HAPPENING IN L.A. COUNTY,

08:19:39.783 --> 08:19:40.950
SPECIFICALLY. AND I CAME AWARE

08:19:41.017 --> 08:19:42.952
OF THESE ISSUES WHEN I WAS THE

08:19:43.019 --> 08:19:44.454
CHAIR OF BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON

08:19:44.521 --> 08:19:45.055
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES THAT

08:19:45.121 --> 08:19:46.056
OVERSEES THE FUNDING TO OUR

08:19:46.122 --> 08:19:48.358
JUVENILE HALLS AFTER THE

08:19:48.425 --> 08:19:49.793
REALIGNMENT HAPPENED. SO IN MY

08:19:49.859 --> 08:19:51.094
BACKYARD, I HAVE ONE JUVENILE

08:19:51.161 --> 08:19:53.029
HALL. AND DURING MY THREE YEARS

08:19:53.096 --> 08:19:54.397
HERE, I STARTED HEARING ABOUT

08:19:54.464 --> 08:19:56.132
THE MISTREATMENT OF INDIVIDUALS

08:19:56.199 --> 08:19:58.735
IN THESE HALLS. IN FACT, ONE BOY

08:19:58.802 --> 08:20:02.005
DIED IN 2023 BECAUSE OF THE POOR

08:20:02.072 --> 08:20:03.506
STAFFING RATIOS THAT ARE

08:20:03.573 --> 08:20:05.342
OCCURRING IN OUR JUVENILE HALLS,

08:20:05.408 --> 08:20:07.110
PARTICULARLY IN THE ONE IN MY

08:20:07.177 --> 08:20:09.179
DISTRICT. AFTER CONDUCTING TWO

08:20:09.245 --> 08:20:10.714
INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS ON THIS

08:20:10.780 --> 08:20:13.016
VERY TOPIC, IT BECAME APPARENT

08:20:13.083 --> 08:20:15.819
THAT MORE NEEDED TO BE DONE. FOR

08:20:15.885 --> 08:20:17.253
DECADES. LA PROBATION AND

08:20:17.320 --> 08:20:17.821
SPECIFICALLY, AND I'M JUST

08:20:17.887 --> 08:20:19.656
POINTING OUT TO ABOUT LA

08:20:19.723 --> 08:20:23.159
PROBATION, HAS BEEN UNDER A

08:20:23.226 --> 08:20:25.428
VIOLATION BY OUR BSC, HAS BEEN

08:20:25.495 --> 08:20:27.230
TOLD BY SEVERAL JUDGES THAT THEY

08:20:27.297 --> 08:20:30.033
NEED TO CLOSE, HAVE HAD 30

08:20:30.100 --> 08:20:31.401
PROBATION OFFICERS INDICTED FOR

08:20:31.468 --> 08:20:33.370
RUNNING GLADIATOR GLADIATOR

08:20:33.436 --> 08:20:34.904
FIGHTS JUST TWO WEEKS OR THREE

08:20:34.971 --> 08:20:36.272
WEEKS AGO, HAS HAD ANOTHER

08:20:36.339 --> 08:20:38.041
PROBATION OFFICER ARRESTED FOR

08:20:38.108 --> 08:20:40.243
BRINGING IN DRUGS. JUVENILES

08:20:40.310 --> 08:20:42.479
HAVE ESCAPED FROM THESE HALLS,

08:20:42.545 --> 08:20:43.880
HAVE OVERDOSED FROM THESE HALLS

08:20:43.947 --> 08:20:46.549
AND FORTUNATELY HAVE NOT PASSED

08:20:46.616 --> 08:20:48.184
AWAY THIS YEAR. AND IT'S

08:20:48.251 --> 08:20:50.286
ONGOING, SO CLOSE THAT OUR

08:20:50.353 --> 08:20:52.055
ATTORNEY GENERAL WANTS TO PUT LA

08:20:52.122 --> 08:20:54.657
PROBATION UNDER RECEIVERSHIP AND

08:20:54.724 --> 08:20:57.060
HAS MENTIONED THAT PUBLICLY. SO

08:20:57.127 --> 08:20:59.028
WHILE LA COUNTY AND PROBATION

08:20:59.095 --> 08:21:00.997
AND THE CHIEF PROBATION HAS

08:21:01.064 --> 08:21:03.233
TRIED FOR YEARS TO FIND A

08:21:03.299 --> 08:21:04.667
SOLUTION, THERE HASN'T BEEN A

08:21:04.734 --> 08:21:05.468
SOLUTION AVAILABLE THAT HAS

08:21:05.535 --> 08:21:06.870
FIXED THE PROBLEMS. WHAT I'M

08:21:06.936 --> 08:21:08.338
BRINGING TO YOU COLLEAGUES ISN'T

08:21:08.405 --> 08:21:10.440
A MAGIC PILL IS I'M NOT CLAIMING

08:21:10.507 --> 08:21:11.808
THAT THIS IS GOING TO SOLVE

08:21:11.875 --> 08:21:12.809
EVERY SINGLE THING THAT'S

08:21:12.876 --> 08:21:14.344
HAPPENING IN LA PROBATION, BUT

08:21:14.411 --> 08:21:16.045
IT IS A STEP FORWARD. AND IN THE

08:21:16.112 --> 08:21:17.947
THREE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN HERE,

08:21:18.014 --> 08:21:19.115
NO OTHER COLLEAGUE HAS

08:21:19.182 --> 08:21:20.150
INTRODUCED A SOLUTION TO THIS

08:21:20.216 --> 08:21:21.951
PROBLEM. I'M THE FIRST MEMBER TO

08:21:22.018 --> 08:21:23.219
ATTEMPT TO TRY TO SOLVE WHAT'S

08:21:23.286 --> 08:21:24.687
HAPPENING IN LA COUNTY, BECAUSE

08:21:24.754 --> 08:21:26.189
WHAT IS HAPPENING IS SPECIFIC TO

08:21:26.256 --> 08:21:27.924
LA COUNTY, TO THE POINT THAT NO

08:21:27.991 --> 08:21:29.692
OTHER COUNTY IS LOOKING TO

08:21:29.759 --> 08:21:30.894
TRANSFER THEIR JUVENILES INTO LA

08:21:30.960 --> 08:21:33.363
COUNTY BECAUSE OF HOW BAD IT IS

08:21:33.430 --> 08:21:35.365
RIGHT NOW. THEY'RE UNDER ORDER

08:21:35.432 --> 08:21:37.700
TO MOVE JUVENILES OUT OF LOS

08:21:37.767 --> 08:21:38.735
PADRINOS BECAUSE IT'S IN

08:21:38.802 --> 08:21:40.403
VIOLATION, BECAUSE IT'S

08:21:40.470 --> 08:21:43.440
INHUMANE. TWO WEEKS AGO, WE HAD<u>%</u>

08:21:43.506 --> 08:21:45.942
JUVENILES WHO WERE ON LOCKDOWN

08:21:46.009 --> 08:21:47.477
FOR FIVE DAYS STRAIGHT, NOT

08:21:47.544 --> 08:21:48.845
BEING ABLE TO GO OUT, NOT BEING

08:21:48.912 --> 08:21:51.214
ABLE TO DO ANYTHING. THIS IS A

08:21:51.281 --> 08:21:53.116
CONSTANT HAPPENING IN OUR

08:21:53.183 --> 08:21:55.318
PROBATION OFFICE. YOU CAN LOOK

08:21:55.385 --> 08:21:57.187
UP LA TIMES AFTER LA TIMES

08:21:57.253 --> 08:21:59.222
ARTICLE THAT CALLS OUT A CALL

08:21:59.289 --> 08:22:00.523
OUT CULTURE, WHERE ON A DAY YOU

08:22:00.590 --> 08:22:03.126
CAN HAVE 60% OF OFFICERS NOT NOT

08:22:03.193 --> 08:22:05.395
SHOWING UP TO WORK. I RECOGNIZE

08:22:05.462 --> 08:22:06.896
THAT THERE MIGHT BE VACANCIES IN

08:22:06.963 --> 08:22:08.798
THESE POSITIONS, BUT LA COUNTY

08:22:08.865 --> 08:22:11.401
HAS EVEN INTRODUCED A $25,000

08:22:11.468 --> 08:22:14.070
SIGN ON BONUS AS OF DECEMBER OF

08:22:14.137 --> 08:22:15.805
LAST YEAR, TO BRING IN MORE

08:22:15.872 --> 08:22:17.574
OFFICERS TO FILL THOSE

08:22:17.640 --> 08:22:19.008
VACANCIES, I CAN GO THROUGH A

08:22:19.075 --> 08:22:20.109
LONG LIST OF WHAT'S HAPPENING.

08:22:20.176 --> 08:22:21.344
THE OPPOSITION WOULD TELL YOU

08:22:21.411 --> 08:22:23.079
THAT TRANSITIONING SOME OF THE

08:22:23.146 --> 08:22:24.514
DUTIES TO A DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT

08:22:24.581 --> 08:22:26.616
IS A PUBLIC HAZARD. IT'S GOING

08:22:26.683 --> 08:22:28.251
TO CREATE A PUBLIC SAFETY

08:22:28.318 --> 08:22:30.053
ISSUES. THIS IS A PUBLIC SAFETY

08:22:30.119 --> 08:22:31.721
ISSUE. KIDS ARE ESCAPING. KIDS

08:22:31.788 --> 08:22:34.123
ARE DYING. KIDS ARE BEING ARE

08:22:34.190 --> 08:22:35.091
OVERDOSING. KIDS ARE BEING

08:22:35.158 --> 08:22:36.593
FORCED TO FIGHT. CURRENTLY,

08:22:36.659 --> 08:22:39.162
RIGHT NOW, THE ADULT PROBATION

08:22:39.229 --> 08:22:40.363
OFFICERS WHO ARE IN THE FIELD,

08:22:40.430 --> 08:22:42.465
WHO OVERSEE ADULTS ARE ACTUALLY

08:22:42.532 --> 08:22:44.634
BEING PULLED OUT OF THE PUBLIC

08:22:44.701 --> 08:22:46.102
TO GO INTO JUVENILE HALLS.

08:22:46.169 --> 08:22:48.271
THAT'S A PUBLIC SAFETY HAZARD.

08:22:48.338 --> 08:22:49.205
THEY'RE SAYING THAT THE PEOPLE

08:22:49.272 --> 08:22:52.542
THAT WE WANT TO PROVIDE SOME OF

08:22:52.609 --> 08:22:53.142
THE FUNDING OR SOME OF THE

08:22:53.209 --> 08:22:55.645
SERVICES TO DO NOT HAVE THE

08:22:55.712 --> 08:22:56.246
TRAINING OR HAVE THE PROPER

08:22:56.312 --> 08:22:57.647
TRAINING TO TAKE CARE OF THESE

08:22:57.714 --> 08:22:59.749
KIDS. I WOULD SAY RIGHT NOW,

08:22:59.816 --> 08:23:00.850
UNFORTUNATELY, PROBATION IS NOT

08:23:00.917 --> 08:23:03.419
TAKING CARE OF OUR KIDS IN AN

08:23:03.486 --> 08:23:05.188
ADEQUATE MANNER. I SAY THIS IS A

08:23:05.255 --> 08:23:06.322
CRISIS THAT NEEDS A RESPONSE

08:23:06.389 --> 08:23:08.124
FROM THE STATE. AND IN DECEMBER

08:23:08.191 --> 08:23:10.226
OF LAST YEAR, I CALLED INTO AS A

08:23:10.293 --> 08:23:11.628
PUBLIC COMMENT INTO LA COUNTY

08:23:11.694 --> 08:23:13.062
AND SAID, I WILL HELP YOU,

08:23:13.129 --> 08:23:15.265
BECAUSE THEY ASKED SPECIFICALLY

08:23:15.331 --> 08:23:17.333
FOR STATE INTERVENTION. SO THIS

08:23:17.400 --> 08:23:20.436
IS WHAT SB 357 IS, STATE

08:23:20.503 --> 08:23:21.905
INTERVENTION THAT IS SPECIFIC TO

08:23:21.971 --> 08:23:23.006
LA COUNTY ONLY. THAT IS

08:23:23.072 --> 08:23:25.375
PERMISSIVE. THAT IS NOT GOING TO

08:23:25.441 --> 08:23:26.309
CHANGE IN ONE DAY. THAT IS GOING

08:23:26.376 --> 08:23:28.144
TO ALLOW THE COUNTY TO COME

08:23:28.211 --> 08:23:29.279
TOGETHER WITH DEPARTMENT OF

08:23:29.345 --> 08:23:31.147
YOUTH DEVELOPMENT, PROBATION AND

08:23:31.214 --> 08:23:32.949
SPELL OUT THE DUTIES AND

08:23:33.016 --> 08:23:33.983
DELEGATE THOSE DUTIES, WHICH IS

08:23:34.050 --> 08:23:36.152
WHY IT'S NOT PRESCRIPTIVE IN MY

08:23:36.219 --> 08:23:37.086
BILL, BECAUSE IT'S UP TO THE

08:23:37.153 --> 08:23:40.523
COUNTY TO DECIDE HOW THOSE JOBS

08:23:40.590 --> 08:23:42.125
AND DUTIES ARE GOING TO BE

08:23:42.191 --> 08:23:44.093
HANDLED IN THE COUNTY. I WILL

08:23:44.160 --> 08:23:45.828
LEAVE MOST OF EVERYTHING ELSE

08:23:45.895 --> 08:23:48.498
JUST TO RESPOND TO QUESTIONS,

08:23:48.565 --> 08:23:51.868
BUT MY COUNTY NEEDS HELP. KIDS

08:23:51.935 --> 08:23:54.837
ARE DYING. WE NEED TO STEP IN

08:23:54.904 --> 08:23:57.273
AND RESPOND TO THIS. JUDGES, OUR

08:23:57.340 --> 08:23:59.742
ATTORNEY GENERAL, OUR BSC, HAVE

08:23:59.809 --> 08:24:01.945
SAID LA PROBATION IS FAILING. IT

08:24:02.011 --> 08:24:03.346
IS OUR TURN NOW AS STATE, AS

08:24:03.413 --> 08:24:06.182
STATE LEGISLATORS TO INTERVENE

08:24:06.249 --> 08:24:07.750
AND DO SOMETHING BECAUSE NOTHING

08:24:07.817 --> 08:24:09.152
ELSE HAS BEEN DONE. THANK YOU.

08:24:09.218 --> 08:24:10.753
AND SENATOR, BEFORE I TURN IT

08:24:10.820 --> 08:24:12.789
OVER TO YOUR WITNESSES, I WANTED

08:24:12.855 --> 08:24:14.691
TO CLARIFY MY UNDERSTANDING AND

08:24:14.757 --> 08:24:16.025
I'LL ASK YOU TO CONFIRM ON THE

08:24:16.092 --> 08:24:17.460
RECORD OR CORRECT ME IF I'M

08:24:17.527 --> 08:24:18.628
MISTAKEN. MY UNDERSTANDING IS

08:24:18.695 --> 08:24:20.463
THAT SHOULD THE BILL PASS OUT OF

08:24:20.530 --> 08:24:21.497
COMMITTEE TODAY, YOU HAVE

08:24:21.564 --> 08:24:22.832
COMMITTED TO HOLDING THE BILL,

08:24:22.899 --> 08:24:24.701
NOT PRESENTING IT FOR A FLOOR

08:24:24.767 --> 08:24:25.868
VOTE IN THE ASSEMBLY BEFORE THE

08:24:25.935 --> 08:24:27.170
END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR. IS

08:24:27.236 --> 08:24:28.738
THAT CORRECT? CORRECT. OKAY.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WITH THAT,

08:24:29.839 --> 08:24:31.007
YOUR WITNESS MAY PROCEED. YOU

08:24:31.074 --> 08:24:32.675
WILL ALSO, MA'AM, HAVE UP TO

08:24:32.742 --> 08:24:34.043
FIVE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE

08:24:34.110 --> 08:24:34.744
COMMITTEE. THANK YOU, MISTER

MEMBERS DANIEL SANCHEZ, ON

08:28:59.842 --> 08:29:01.077
BEHALF OF THE CHIEF PROBATION

08:29:01.143 --> 08:29:02.278
OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA IN

08:29:02.345 --> 08:29:04.580
OPPOSITION TO SB 357 AS PROPOSED

08:29:04.647 --> 08:29:06.282
TO BE AMENDED. I DO WANT TO BE

08:29:06.349 --> 08:29:08.351
VERY CLEAR THAT CPAC IS A

08:29:08.417 --> 08:29:09.352
STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION MUST

08:29:09.418 --> 08:29:10.553
UNDERSCORE THAT THE CHANGES IN

08:29:10.620 --> 08:29:12.588
THIS BILL DO, IN FACT, HAVE

08:29:12.655 --> 08:29:13.456
IMPLICATIONS STATEWIDE TO

08:29:13.522 --> 08:29:14.523
PROBATION DEPARTMENTS, COURTS

08:29:14.590 --> 08:29:16.659
AND COUNTIES. THIS IS DUE TO THE

08:29:16.726 --> 08:29:17.693
INTEROPERABILITY OF COURT

08:29:17.760 --> 08:29:18.828
PROCESSES, TRANSFER OF

08:29:18.895 --> 08:29:20.696
RESIDENTS, TRANSFER OF COURT

08:29:20.763 --> 08:29:21.764
JURISDICTION AND SUPERVISION

08:29:21.831 --> 08:29:23.900
AMONG PROBATION. SO THIS DOES

08:29:23.966 --> 08:29:25.735
INDEED HAVE STATEWIDE PROBATION

08:29:25.801 --> 08:29:26.836
IMPACTS. PROBATION IS PART OF

08:29:26.903 --> 08:29:28.938
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PART OF THE

08:29:29.005 --> 08:29:29.872
COURTS. THAT IS CRITICAL BECAUSE

08:29:29.939 --> 08:29:31.741
THERE ARE REGULATIONS, STATUTES,

08:29:31.807 --> 08:29:33.142
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN PLACE

08:29:33.209 --> 08:29:34.977
THAT ARE NOT SIMPLE OR EASY IN

08:29:35.044 --> 08:29:36.379
NATURE. AND IT IS THAT PROBATION

08:29:36.445 --> 08:29:37.480
MISSION THAT IS NOT

08:29:37.546 --> 08:29:38.447
INTERCHANGEABLE WITH OTHER

08:29:38.514 --> 08:29:39.615
COUNTY ENTITIES OR

08:29:39.682 --> 08:29:41.784
NON-GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES. IT IS

08:29:41.851 --> 08:29:44.253
THOSE SPECIFIC FACTORS AND KIND

08:29:44.320 --> 08:29:45.955
OF MISSION OF PROBATION. THAT IS

08:29:46.022 --> 08:29:47.390
WHY PROBATION WORK IS CODIFIED

08:29:47.456 --> 08:29:49.392
IN THE GOVERNMENT CODE, WHICH IS

08:29:49.458 --> 08:29:51.260
IMPACTED BY THIS BILL. WHAT THE

08:29:51.327 --> 08:29:53.462
AUTHOR HAS SAID IS NEEDED TO BE

08:29:53.529 --> 08:29:54.530
DONE WITH CAN BE DONE WITHOUT

08:29:54.597 --> 08:29:56.966
THIS BILL. AND I THINK THAT IS A

08:29:57.033 --> 08:29:58.100
REALLY IMPORTANT THING TO

08:29:58.167 --> 08:29:59.502
HIGHLIGHT. BUT INSTEAD WHAT THIS

08:29:59.568 --> 08:30:01.037
BILL CHANGES IS THE GOVERNMENT

08:30:01.103 --> 08:30:02.672
CODE SECTION AND TRANSFERS

08:30:02.738 --> 08:30:04.240
PROBATION DUTIES TO ANOTHER

08:30:04.307 --> 08:30:06.242
ENTITY. THIS BILL REMOVES DUTIES

08:30:06.309 --> 08:30:07.743
FROM THE VERY ENTITY THAT HAS

08:30:07.810 --> 08:30:09.211
EXTENSIVE TRAINING AND

08:30:09.278 --> 08:30:10.613
EXPERIENCE IN BOTH THE YOUTH

08:30:10.680 --> 08:30:12.014
DEVELOPMENT AND REHABILITATION,

08:30:12.081 --> 08:30:13.649
AND THE SAFETY OF OUR

08:30:13.716 --> 08:30:15.318
COMMUNITIES. I ALSO WANT TO

08:30:15.384 --> 08:30:17.620
HIGHLIGHT THAT, AS NOTED IN THE

08:30:17.687 --> 08:30:18.888
ANALYSIS AROUND TRAINING AND

08:30:18.955 --> 08:30:20.022
QUALIFICATIONS, THIS BILL NOR

08:30:20.089 --> 08:30:22.525
THE AMENDMENTS ADDRESS THOSE

08:30:22.591 --> 08:30:23.926
FACTORS. AND WHEN WE ARE TALKING

08:30:23.993 --> 08:30:26.262
ABOUT OVERSEEING SECURE

08:30:26.329 --> 08:30:27.863
DETENTION FACILITIES AND ALSO

08:30:27.930 --> 08:30:29.765
ORDERS OF THE COURT FOR THE

08:30:29.832 --> 08:30:32.034
HIGHEST RISK, HIGHEST NEED, MOST

08:30:32.101 --> 08:30:34.437
SERIOUS YOUTH OFFENSES IN OUR

08:30:34.503 --> 08:30:36.172
STATE, THAT WE CANNOT TAKE THAT

08:30:36.238 --> 08:30:37.940
LIGHTLY. WHEN WE LOOK AT WHO IS

08:30:38.007 --> 08:30:40.209
HANDLING THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES.

08:30:40.276 --> 08:30:42.845
SO IN RECOGNIZING TIME, I WOULD

08:30:42.912 --> 08:30:44.447
JUST KIND OF CLOSE IN SAYING

08:30:44.513 --> 08:30:46.382
THIS BILL REPRESENTS A REMOVAL

08:30:46.449 --> 08:30:46.949
OF PROBATION FROM CRITICAL

08:30:47.016 --> 08:30:48.551
JUVENILE JUSTICE PROCESSES THAT

08:30:48.617 --> 08:30:50.319
DOES HAVE IMPLICATIONS TO PUBLIC

08:30:50.386 --> 08:30:52.121
SAFETY AND THE IMPORTANT

08:30:52.188 --> 08:30:52.989
INTERACTIONS THAT PROBATION HAS

08:30:53.055 --> 08:30:54.523
WITH OUR COURTS, WITH OUR COUNTY

08:30:54.590 --> 08:30:55.624
PARTNERS, AND WITH

08:30:55.691 --> 08:30:56.759
NON-GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES. SO

08:30:56.826 --> 08:30:58.627
FOR THOSE REASONS, WE ARE

08:30:58.694 --> 08:31:00.463

08:31:31.060 --> 08:31:33.095
WHEN HOPEFULLY THE RECORD IS

08:31:33.162 --> 08:31:33.763
SEALED AND THAT YOUNG PERSON CAN

08:31:33.829 --> 08:31:35.197
MOVE FORWARD. AND EVERY SINGLE

08:31:35.264 --> 08:31:36.132
STEP OF THAT WAY, THEY ARE

08:31:36.198 --> 08:31:37.033
WORKING WITH PROBATION TO

08:31:37.099 --> 08:31:38.434
ACCOMPLISH THE TASK THAT THEY

08:31:38.501 --> 08:31:40.002
NEED TO ACCOMPLISH. AND THE

08:31:40.069 --> 08:31:41.003
STATUTES AND THE WELFARE AND

08:31:41.070 --> 08:31:42.805
INSTITUTIONS CODE ARE CLEAR OF

08:31:42.872 --> 08:31:43.672
THE OBLIGATIONS OF PROBATION TO

08:31:43.739 --> 08:31:45.107
THE COURT AND THEIR ROLE WITH

08:31:45.174 --> 08:31:47.143
THE COURT. AS WE TYPICALLY SAY,

08:31:47.209 --> 08:31:48.477
PROBATION IS AN ARM OF THE

08:31:48.544 --> 08:31:51.814
COURT, AND SB 357 WOULD PROPOSE

08:31:51.881 --> 08:31:53.616
TO ALLOW UNILATERALLY A BOARD OF

08:31:53.682 --> 08:31:54.984
SUPERVISORS TO SEVER THAT ARM

08:31:55.051 --> 08:31:57.420
AND CRAFT A NEW ONE ON, WITHOUT

08:31:57.486 --> 08:31:59.455
ANY GUARANTEE THAT THERE WILL BE

08:31:59.522 --> 08:32:00.923
OBLIGATIONS TO DO THE DUTIES IN

08:32:00.990 --> 08:32:02.658
A TIMELY WAY WITH TRAINED

08:32:02.725 --> 08:32:03.726
PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE PREPARED

08:32:03.793 --> 08:32:05.961
TO DO THE WORK OF THE COURT. WE

08:32:06.028 --> 08:32:07.063
TAKE OUR STATUTORY MISSION IN

08:32:07.129 --> 08:32:07.963
THE JUVENILE COURT VERY

08:32:08.030 --> 08:32:09.465
SERIOUSLY AND WITHOUT MORE

08:32:09.532 --> 08:32:10.433
STRUCTURE AND STATUTORY CLARITY,

08:32:10.499 --> 08:32:12.068
WE DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE BEING

08:32:12.134 --> 08:32:14.603
ABLE TO ALLOW A BOARD OF

08:32:14.670 --> 08:32:15.704
SUPERVISORS TO DELEGATE THOSE

08:32:15.771 --> 08:32:16.272
RESPONSIBILITIES WITHOUT THE

08:32:16.338 --> 08:32:18.007
COURT BEING AT THE TABLE AND

08:32:18.074 --> 08:32:18.974
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE WORK WILL

08:32:19.041 --> 08:32:20.976
BE ABLE TO BE DONE, BECAUSE THE

08:32:21.043 --> 08:32:22.845
COURT WILL BE UNABLE TO THEN GO

08:32:22.912 --> 08:32:24.080
AND PROTECT THE BEST INTERESTS

08:32:24.146 --> 08:32:24.980
OF THOSE YOUTH. FOR THOSE

08:32:25.047 --> 08:32:27.316
REASONS, WE OPPOSE. THANK YOU A

08:32:27.383 --> 08:32:28.050
LITTLE BIT MORE THAN A MINUTE

08:32:28.117 --> 08:32:30.453
AND A HALF REMAINING. THANK YOU.

08:32:30.519 --> 08:32:31.353
THANK YOU, HONORABLE CHAIR AND

08:32:31.420 --> 08:32:33.122
HONORABLE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. MY

08:32:33.189 --> 08:32:34.757
NAME IS JONATHAN BIRD. THAT

08:32:34.824 --> 08:32:36.859
DOESN'T MEAN MUCH. NEXT MONTH

08:32:36.926 --> 08:32:38.594
WILL BE MY 50TH YEAR AS A

08:32:38.661 --> 08:32:40.496
RESIDENT OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY.

08:32:40.563 --> 08:32:41.931
I AM A JUVENILE PROBATION

08:32:41.997 --> 08:32:43.666
OFFICER IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY

08:32:43.732 --> 08:32:45.734
FOR 33 YEARS, AND I ALSO SERVE

08:32:45.801 --> 08:32:47.303
AS SECOND VICE PRESIDENT, CHAIR

08:32:47.369 --> 08:32:50.072
OF LOCAL 685. SO THAT GIVES ME

08:32:50.139 --> 08:32:52.007
ABILITY. IF I HAD TIME TO SPEAK

08:32:52.074 --> 08:32:53.242
ON SEVERAL THINGS THAT ARE

08:32:53.309 --> 08:32:55.211
CONTAINED IN THE BILL. BUT WHAT

08:32:55.277 --> 08:32:57.413
I'LL FIRST SAY ABOUT THE BILL IS

08:32:57.480 --> 08:32:58.848
ANYTIME A BILL IS PRESENTED, IT

08:32:58.914 --> 08:33:01.684
OUGHT TO GET TO THE ASSEMBLY

08:33:01.750 --> 08:33:03.786
MEMBERS AND BE CLEAR ON WHAT IT

08:33:03.853 --> 08:33:06.088
IS TRYING TO DO. AND THEN THERE

08:33:06.155 --> 08:33:07.756
SHOULD BE DUE DILIGENCE. THE

08:33:07.823 --> 08:33:11.060
BILL, AS THE AUTHOR HAS SAID, IS

08:33:11.127 --> 08:33:12.061
TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT ARE

08:33:12.128 --> 08:33:13.929
CAUSED BY PROBATION. EARLIER

08:33:13.996 --> 08:33:15.131
TODAY, I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE

08:33:15.197 --> 08:33:16.732
ALL DAY. EARLIER THE DAY, THE

08:33:16.799 --> 08:33:18.334
CHAIR MADE A STATEMENT, HE SAYS

08:33:18.400 --> 08:33:19.268
THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE

08:33:19.335 --> 08:33:21.070
CONCERNED ABOUT PROTECTING THE

08:33:21.137 --> 08:33:23.139
VALUES OF THE STATE. PROBATION

08:33:23.205 --> 08:33:25.074
HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE SINCE

08:33:25.141 --> 08:33:27.243
1903. IN THE YEAR OF 2000, THE

08:33:27.309 --> 08:33:29.078
STATE DECIDED THAT THEY NEEDED

08:33:29.145 --> 08:33:31.113
TO DO A PROBATION SERVICES TASK

08:33:31.180 --> 08:33:32.915
FORCE OUT OF THAT TASK FORCE

08:33:32.982 --> 08:33:34.583
THAT DID A REVIEW FOR THREE

08:33:34.650 --> 08:33:37.686
YEARS. IN JUNE OF 2003, IT

08:33:37.753 --> 08:33:39.889
PRESENTED A REPORT THAT MADE 17

08:33:39.955 --> 08:33:41.257
RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE STATE AND

08:33:41.323 --> 08:33:43.025
HOW TO HANDLE PROBATION

08:33:43.092 --> 08:33:43.959
DEPARTMENT, AND HOW TO GET ALL

08:33:44.026 --> 08:33:46.061
THE REFORMS THAT THEY NEED TO

08:33:46.128 --> 08:33:48.164
GET IN 30S. SO WHAT I WILL SAY

08:33:48.230 --> 08:33:50.666
ABOUT THE BILL, THE BILL IS AN

08:33:50.733 --> 08:33:52.034
ATTACK ON THE PROBATION

08:33:52.101 --> 08:33:54.370
DEPARTMENT. ANYONE THAT DOES NOT

08:33:54.436 --> 08:33:55.704
FEEL THE NEED TO VOTE IN

08:33:55.771 --> 08:33:57.139
OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL IS

08:33:57.206 --> 08:33:58.507
SAYING THAT PROBATION IS AN

08:33:58.574 --> 08:34:00.376
ENTITY THAT SHOULD NOT BE

08:34:00.442 --> 08:34:01.810
EXISTING IN THE STATE OF

08:34:01.877 --> 08:34:03.078
CALIFORNIA. AND IF THE AUTHOR

08:34:03.145 --> 08:34:04.446
WOULD LIKE TO HELP PROBATION,

08:34:04.513 --> 08:34:06.115
THEN MAYBE THE AUTHOR SHOULD

08:34:06.182 --> 08:34:08.250
CONCENTRATE ON HAVING ANOTHER

08:34:08.317 --> 08:34:10.085
PROBATION SERVICE TASK FORCE TO

08:34:10.152 --> 08:34:11.921
FIND THE REMEDIES SO THAT WE CAN

08:34:11.987 --> 08:34:13.122
PROTECT THE YOUTH OF THIS

08:34:13.189 --> 08:34:14.356

SUPERVISORS FOR WEIGHING IN AND

08:36:28.824 --> 08:36:30.059
WORKING ON THIS BILL. AND THE

08:36:30.125 --> 08:36:31.860
AUTHOR, AS WE KNOW, IS NOT

08:36:31.927 --> 08:36:34.930

08:36:34.997 --> 08:36:37.032

HERE AND EVERYTHING YOU GUYS

08:36:38.867 --> 08:36:40.569
SAID. I THINK THAT HAVING HAVING

08:36:40.636 --> 08:36:42.738
HEARD FROM BOTH SIDES AND LIVING

08:36:42.805 --> 08:36:44.473
IN LA COUNTY AND REPRESENTING LA

08:36:44.540 --> 08:36:46.241
COUNTY, WE ARE, I THINK, ALL ON

08:36:46.308 --> 08:36:48.243
THE SAME PAGE. WE WANT TO SEE

08:36:48.310 --> 08:36:49.144
BETTER OUTCOMES. I THINK

08:36:49.211 --> 08:36:50.212
EVERYONE WANTS TO SEE BETTER

08:36:50.279 --> 08:36:51.747
OUTCOMES. I THINK THE AUTHOR

08:36:51.814 --> 08:36:52.848
WANTS TO SEE BETTER OUTCOMES.

08:36:52.915 --> 08:36:54.016
ALL FIVE OF OUR COUNTY

08:36:54.083 --> 08:36:55.751
SUPERVISORS WANT TO SEE BETTER

08:36:55.818 --> 08:36:56.952
OUTCOMES. AND THE ISSUE THAT

08:36:57.019 --> 08:36:58.420
WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE IS

08:36:58.487 --> 08:36:59.555
INDISPUTABLE. WE NEED TO BE

08:36:59.621 --> 08:37:01.023
BETTER. WE NEED TO BE BETTER IN

08:37:01.090 --> 08:37:02.658
THESE INSTITUTIONS FOR OUR

08:37:02.725 --> 08:37:05.361
YOUTH, AND WE NEED TO HAVE

08:37:05.427 --> 08:37:07.896
BETTER TREATMENT WITHIN THESE

08:37:07.963 --> 08:37:09.064
FACILITIES. THE QUESTION IS, HOW

08:37:09.131 --> 08:37:10.766
DO WE GET THERE? AND I THINK

08:37:10.833 --> 08:37:12.334
THAT THE AUTHOR HAS DONE A GOOD

08:37:12.401 --> 08:37:14.503
JOB OF WORKING WITH OPPOSITION,

08:37:14.570 --> 08:37:15.437
AND I APPRECIATE JUST HOW HARD

08:37:15.504 --> 08:37:16.572
YOU'VE WORKED AND THE INORDINATE

08:37:16.638 --> 08:37:18.107
AMOUNT OF TIME THAT HAS GONE

08:37:18.173 --> 08:37:19.808
INTO THIS BILL. I DO THINK THESE

08:37:19.875 --> 08:37:21.009
AMENDMENTS GIVE US MORE TIME,

08:37:21.076 --> 08:37:23.712
AND I DO THINK THAT THERE'S A

08:37:23.779 --> 08:37:25.914
PROCESS THAT THAT CAN WORK OUT

08:37:25.981 --> 08:37:27.716
WHERE CONVERSATIONS AND

08:37:27.783 --> 08:37:29.852
HOPEFULLY SOLUTIONS CAN BE HAD,

08:37:29.918 --> 08:37:31.053
BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

08:37:31.120 --> 08:37:33.822
TIME AND FOR BOTH SIDES. THERE'S

08:37:33.889 --> 08:37:35.624
BEEN A LOT OF TIME PUT INTO

08:37:35.691 --> 08:37:37.226
THIS, AND WE'RE STILL AT A PLACE

08:37:37.292 --> 08:37:38.861
THAT ISN'T IDEAL. AND I DON'T

08:37:38.927 --> 08:37:41.029
THINK THIS IS AN ATTACK. AND I

08:37:41.096 --> 08:37:43.165
DO THINK THAT NO ONE UP HERE

08:37:43.232 --> 08:37:43.699
WANTS TO ATTACK PROBATION

08:37:43.766 --> 08:37:45.100
OFFICERS. CERTAINLY NOT. I COULD

08:37:45.167 --> 08:37:46.869
LOOK AROUND THIS DAIS. NOT A

08:37:46.935 --> 08:37:48.404
SINGLE PERSON UP HERE WOULD WANT

08:37:48.470 --> 08:37:49.738
TO ATTACK ANYTHING THAT

08:37:49.805 --> 08:37:51.240
PROBATION OFFICERS OR ANYONE IN

08:37:51.306 --> 08:37:53.642
LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES. BUT I DO

08:37:53.709 --> 08:37:56.345
THINK THAT WE OWE IT TO THOSE

08:37:56.412 --> 08:37:58.280
GOING THROUGH THIS SYSTEM TO

08:37:58.347 --> 08:38:00.883
ENSURE THAT THERE IS A JUST,

08:38:00.949 --> 08:38:04.486
EQUITABLE PROCESS FOR THEM. AND

08:38:04.553 --> 08:38:06.355
WE ARE WE ARE FALLING SHORT. AND

08:38:06.422 --> 08:38:08.257
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THIS

08:38:08.323 --> 08:38:10.259
WILL LEAD, BUT I DO THINK THAT,

08:38:10.325 --> 08:38:12.060
AS THE SENATOR SAID, NO ONE HAS

08:38:12.127 --> 08:38:13.328
BEEN WILLING TO TAKE THIS ON,

08:38:13.395 --> 08:38:16.031
AND I DO APPRECIATE THAT SHE HAS

08:38:16.098 --> 08:38:17.833
TAKEN IT ON. AND WITH THESE

08:38:17.900 --> 08:38:18.867
AMENDMENTS, I WILL MOVE THE

08:38:18.934 --> 08:38:21.003
BILL. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, MR.

08:38:21.069 --> 08:38:22.070
GARABEDIAN. I'LL COME BACK AND

08:38:22.137 --> 08:38:23.872
ASK FOR A SECOND. BUT WE DO HAVE

08:38:23.939 --> 08:38:25.174
A MOTION. WITH THAT SAID, WOULD

08:38:25.240 --> 08:38:27.309
ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO JUMP IN? MR.

08:38:27.376 --> 08:38:30.312
HANEY, PLEASE? WELL, THANK YOU

08:38:30.379 --> 08:38:31.814
TO THE AUTHOR. AND THANK YOU FOR

08:38:31.880 --> 08:38:33.015
YOUR LEADERSHIP. AND I KNOW THE

08:38:33.081 --> 08:38:35.083
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AS WELL,

08:38:35.150 --> 08:38:36.852
WHO ARE REALLY TRYING TO LOOK AT

08:38:36.919 --> 08:38:40.122
HOW BEST TO SERVE THE YOUNG

08:38:40.189 --> 08:38:42.257
PEOPLE OF YOUR COUNTY, HOW TO

08:38:42.324 --> 08:38:44.760
ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE BEST

08:38:44.827 --> 08:38:46.862
SUPPORTS, PLACEMENTS,

08:38:46.929 --> 08:38:48.764
OPPORTUNITIES FOR SERVICES, FOR

08:38:48.831 --> 08:38:51.667
SAFETY, FOR REENTRY, AND HAVE

08:38:51.733 --> 08:38:53.435
COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THIS

08:38:53.502 --> 08:38:55.370
IS THE WAY TO GO ABOUT IT. AND

08:38:55.437 --> 08:38:58.006
SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I

08:38:58.073 --> 08:38:59.908
RESPECT AND SOMETHING I THINK

08:38:59.975 --> 08:39:03.145
SHOULD BE A RESPONSIBILITY THAT

08:39:03.212 --> 08:39:05.747
ALL OF US HAVE. I SERVED ON THE

08:39:05.814 --> 08:39:07.082
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN SAN

08:39:07.149 --> 08:39:09.551
FRANCISCO. THIS WAS ALSO A HUGE

08:39:09.618 --> 08:39:11.286
CONCERN FOR US. WHEN I WAS ON

08:39:11.353 --> 08:39:13.355
THAT BOARD. WE ACTUALLY TOOK THE

08:39:13.422 --> 08:39:15.591
STEPS IN MY FIRST YEAR ON THE

08:39:15.657 --> 08:39:16.825
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO PASS A

08:39:16.892 --> 08:39:19.394
LAW TO, TO CLOSE OR ATTEMPT TO

08:39:19.461 --> 08:39:21.430
CLOSE OUR JUVENILE FACILITY,

08:39:21.497 --> 08:39:23.932
BECAUSE THERE WAS A SENSE THAT

08:39:23.999 --> 08:39:25.901
AND I THINK IT'S A REAL ONE,

08:39:25.968 --> 08:39:28.303
THAT FOR MOST YOUNG PEOPLE, THEY

08:39:28.370 --> 08:39:31.206
SHOULD NOT BE LOCKED UP IN

08:39:31.273 --> 08:39:33.041
CAGES. THEY SHOULD NOT BE

08:39:33.108 --> 08:39:34.643
INCARCERATED IN IN SITUATIONS

08:39:34.710 --> 08:39:36.945
LIKE WHERE WE PLACE ADULTS, AND

08:39:37.012 --> 08:39:38.847
THAT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, THAT

08:39:38.914 --> 08:39:40.849
WILL LEAD TO THE TYPE OF

08:39:40.916 --> 08:39:42.351
OUTCOMES THAT ARE ACTUALLY MUCH

08:39:42.417 --> 08:39:45.053
WORSE FOR THEM. AND WE HAD, YOU

08:39:45.120 --> 08:39:47.122
KNOW, LIKE YOU, YOU ALL HAVE

08:39:47.189 --> 08:39:48.857
MANY, MANY GENERATIONS,

08:39:48.924 --> 08:39:50.659
TRAGICALLY, OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO

08:39:50.726 --> 08:39:52.361
HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS, THESE

08:39:52.427 --> 08:39:54.196
SYSTEMS. AND WE'VE NOT ONLY

08:39:54.263 --> 08:39:57.065
FAILED THEM, WE'VE HARMED THEM.

08:39:57.132 --> 08:39:59.234
AND THAT SHOULD LEAD US TO THINK

08:39:59.301 --> 08:40:01.537
ABOUT FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES.

08:40:01.603 --> 08:40:05.040
ABSOLUTELY. AND SO I, I RESPECT

08:40:05.107 --> 08:40:07.376
AND APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS THAT

08:40:07.442 --> 08:40:09.978
ARE BEING TAKEN TO DO THAT. I

08:40:10.045 --> 08:40:12.548
WILL SAY THAT DURING THE TIME

08:40:12.614 --> 08:40:14.049
WHEN WE WERE CONSIDERING EVEN

08:40:14.116 --> 08:40:17.486
CLOSING OUR FACILITY, THERE WAS

08:40:17.553 --> 08:40:20.088
NOT AN EFFORT UNDER

08:40:20.155 --> 08:40:21.990
CONSIDERATION TO ACTUALLY MOVE

08:40:22.057 --> 08:40:27.262
THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF. CUSTODY

08:40:27.329 --> 08:40:29.398
AND SERVICES THAT WE WERE

08:40:29.464 --> 08:40:31.934
LEGALLY MANDATED TO, TO BE

08:40:32.000 --> 08:40:33.902
RESPONSIBLE FOR OUT OF OUR

08:40:33.969 --> 08:40:35.704
JUVENILE PROBATION, THAT IT WAS

08:40:35.771 --> 08:40:37.239
THAT IT WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING

08:40:37.306 --> 08:40:39.041
THAT WE KNEW THAT WE HAD TO DO

08:40:39.107 --> 08:40:41.410
WITH THESE OFFICERS, WITH THE

08:40:41.476 --> 08:40:43.211
STAFF, WITH THE FOLKS WHO ARE

08:40:43.278 --> 08:40:44.246
PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES NOW.

08:40:44.313 --> 08:40:46.448
AND IT HAD TO BE DONE IN

08:40:46.515 --> 08:40:47.883
COLLABORATION WITHIN THE SYSTEM

08:40:47.950 --> 08:40:50.085
THAT WE HAD, WHICH IS ONE THAT

08:40:50.152 --> 08:40:53.388
NOT ONLY IS SOMETHING THAT WE

08:40:53.455 --> 08:40:55.223
SET AS, AS, AS THE BOARD, BUT

08:40:55.290 --> 08:40:57.192
THAT IS SET BY THE STATE. THERE

08:40:57.259 --> 08:40:59.394
ARE CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITIES

08:40:59.461 --> 08:41:02.030
AROUND CUSTODY OF WHO HAS TO

08:41:02.097 --> 08:41:03.765
CARE FOR SOMEBODY. ONCE A COURT

08:41:03.832 --> 08:41:05.901
MAKES A DECISION, WHO TAKES ON

08:41:05.968 --> 08:41:07.703
THAT RESPONSIBILITY AND WHAT

08:41:07.769 --> 08:41:09.638
THEIR TRAINING IS, WHAT SERVICES

08:41:09.705 --> 08:41:10.939
THEY HAVE TO PROVIDE. ALL OF

08:41:11.006 --> 08:41:13.308
THAT IS IN MANY CASES SET BY THE

08:41:13.375 --> 08:41:16.345
STATE. AND SO WHETHER WHETHER OR

08:41:16.411 --> 08:41:19.014
NOT THE RIGHT SOLUTION TO A VERY

08:41:19.081 --> 08:41:21.483
REAL PROBLEM IS TO MOVE FOLKS TO

08:41:21.550 --> 08:41:23.919
A DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT, I THINK

08:41:23.986 --> 08:41:27.322
IS ONE THAT IT SEEMS DESERVES

08:41:27.389 --> 08:41:29.625
SOME MORE CONVERSATION. AND SO I

08:41:29.691 --> 08:41:31.059
APPRECIATE THE STEPS THAT YOU'VE

08:41:31.126 --> 08:41:32.494
TAKEN NOT ONLY TO, TO, TO HAVE

08:41:32.561 --> 08:41:34.830
THESE AMENDMENTS, BUT ALSO TO

08:41:34.896 --> 08:41:37.299
COMMIT TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON

08:41:37.366 --> 08:41:39.334
THIS, THIS QUESTION AND TO DO

08:41:39.401 --> 08:41:41.169
SO, I HOPE, IN CLOSE

08:41:41.236 --> 08:41:42.904
COLLABORATION WITH THE FOLKS WHO

08:41:42.971 --> 08:41:44.439
ARE STAKEHOLDERS, WHO PROVIDE

08:41:44.506 --> 08:41:45.874
THOSE SERVICES CURRENTLY, WHO

08:41:45.941 --> 08:41:47.309
ARE STAFF AND THEIR

08:41:47.376 --> 08:41:49.111
REPRESENTATIVES, THE, THE, THE,

08:41:49.177 --> 08:41:50.846
THE, THE UNIONS, WHO REPRESENT

08:41:50.912 --> 08:41:52.681
THE FOLKS WHO, WHO DO THOSE

08:41:52.748 --> 08:41:54.282
SERVICES AND HAVE THOSE

08:41:54.349 --> 08:41:55.550
RESPONSIBILITIES NOW. AND SO I

08:41:55.617 --> 08:41:57.386
THINK, YOU KNOW, TAKING THAT

08:41:57.452 --> 08:41:58.854
TIME AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE

08:41:58.920 --> 08:42:00.922
CONSEQUENCES OF THIS WILL BE AND

08:42:00.989 --> 08:42:02.457
HOW TO DO IT RIGHT, IS CRUCIAL.

08:42:02.524 --> 08:42:05.861
I WANT TO ASK A QUESTION WHICH

08:42:05.927 --> 08:42:08.130
THIS THIS MAY BE IN PART FOR THE

08:42:08.196 --> 08:42:09.965
AUTHOR AND MAY BE IN PART FOR

08:42:10.032 --> 08:42:11.566
THE OPPOSITION, BECAUSE ONE OF

08:42:11.633 --> 08:42:12.801
THE THINGS THAT WAS CONCERNING

08:42:12.868 --> 08:42:15.070
TO ME IS THIS SENSE THAT, AS I

08:42:15.137 --> 08:42:17.873
SAID, THAT WE'VE SET CERTAIN

08:42:17.939 --> 08:42:22.177
STATE LAWS OF HOW JUVENILES IN

08:42:22.244 --> 08:42:25.847
CUSTODY ARE REQUIRED TO BE HELD,

08:42:25.914 --> 08:42:27.849
TRANSFERRED. THE TRAINING

08:42:27.916 --> 08:42:29.484
INVOLVED THE THAT THAT THERE ARE

08:42:29.551 --> 08:42:32.020
CERTAIN STATE MANDATES HERE FOR

08:42:32.087 --> 08:42:35.257
GOOD REASON AND SOME OF ALSO LED

08:42:35.323 --> 08:42:37.426
BY THE COURTS THAT IF WE HAD ONE

08:42:37.492 --> 08:42:39.528
COUNTY WHICH WOULD HAPPEN TO BE

08:42:39.594 --> 08:42:42.364
OUR BIGGEST COUNTY THAT HAD A

08:42:42.431 --> 08:42:44.900
DIFFERENT SET OF FOLKS

08:42:44.966 --> 08:42:46.001
RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT, A

08:42:46.068 --> 08:42:47.402
DIFFERENT SET OF TRAINING AND

08:42:47.469 --> 08:42:49.204
SERVICES, MAYBE NOT OFFICERS, IN

08:42:49.271 --> 08:42:51.440
THE SAME WAY THAT THIS WOULD

08:42:51.506 --> 08:42:53.909
CREATE CHALLENGES FOR THE COURTS

08:42:53.975 --> 08:42:55.577
AND IT COULD CREATE CHALLENGES

08:42:55.644 --> 08:42:56.378
FOR OTHER COUNTIES. IT WAS

08:42:56.445 --> 08:42:57.879
INTERESTING TO ME TO SEE THAT

08:42:57.946 --> 08:42:59.014
THERE WERE MULTIPLE OTHER

08:42:59.081 --> 08:43:01.383
COUNTIES THAT WERE HERE IN

08:43:01.450 --> 08:43:02.818
OPPOSITION SANTA CRUZ, CONTRA

08:43:02.884 --> 08:43:07.189
COSTA COUNTY. AND SO HOW THIS IS

08:43:07.255 --> 08:43:07.989
FOR THE AUTHOR AND SPONSOR.

08:43:08.056 --> 08:43:10.625
MAYBE FIRST, HOW DO YOU THINK

08:43:10.692 --> 08:43:13.962
THAT THIS EFFORT WOULD BE ABLE

08:43:14.029 --> 08:43:15.363
TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS SO

08:43:15.430 --> 08:43:16.865
THAT WE STILL WERE ABLE YOU ALL

08:43:16.932 --> 08:43:19.034
WERE STILL ABLE TO ABIDE BY THE

08:43:19.101 --> 08:43:19.968
RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER STATE LAW

08:43:20.035 --> 08:43:22.971
AND INTERACT EFFECTIVELY AND

08:43:23.038 --> 08:43:24.806
APPROPRIATELY WITH THE OTHER

08:43:24.873 --> 08:43:26.208
COUNTIES AS AS MANDATED BY THE

08:43:26.274 --> 08:43:28.677
LAW, AS MANDATED BY THE STATE

08:43:28.744 --> 08:43:29.544
AND THE COURTS. THANK YOU FOR

08:43:29.611 --> 08:43:30.779
THE OPPORTUNITY TO FOR ME TO

08:43:30.846 --> 08:43:32.514
ANSWER THIS, I FORGOT TO MENTION

08:43:32.581 --> 08:43:35.150
THIS IN MY OPENING REMARKS. SO I

08:43:35.217 --> 08:43:36.551
KNOW THE OPPOSITION MENTIONED ON

08:43:36.618 --> 08:43:38.153
THE TRANSFER BETWEEN COUNTY AND

08:43:38.220 --> 08:43:40.188
SO FORTH. THE MOU S ARE BETWEEN

08:43:40.255 --> 08:43:42.357
COUNTIES ONLY, NOT BETWEEN

08:43:42.424 --> 08:43:44.426
PROBATION, SO IT WON'T IMPACT

08:43:44.493 --> 08:43:47.696
ANY TRANSFERS FROM COUNTY OF

08:43:47.763 --> 08:43:49.030
SANTA CRUZ TO LA COUNTY BECAUSE

08:43:49.097 --> 08:43:52.167
AS THOSE MOUS ARE WITH LA COUNTY

08:43:52.234 --> 08:43:54.236
SPECIFICALLY ONLY. SO YOU CAN

08:43:54.302 --> 08:43:55.937
STILL TRANSFER IF YOU WISH. BUT

08:43:56.004 --> 08:43:58.373
RESPECTFULLY, I DON'T. I DON'T

08:43:58.440 --> 08:44:00.242
KNOW IF YOUR COUNTY'S ASSEMBLY

08:44:00.308 --> 08:44:02.043
MEMBER IS GOING TO WANT TO SEND

08:44:02.110 --> 08:44:03.278
JUVENILES TO MY COUNTY RIGHT

08:44:03.345 --> 08:44:04.346
NOW, BUT THE CONTRACTS ARE

08:44:04.412 --> 08:44:05.814
BETWEEN THE COUNTIES. THE SECOND

08:44:05.881 --> 08:44:08.383
POINT, YOU'RE 100% RIGHT, AND I

08:44:08.450 --> 08:44:10.085
HAVEN'T RECEIVED A SINGLE

08:44:10.152 --> 08:44:11.686
AMENDMENT FROM OPPOSITION EXCEPT

08:44:11.753 --> 08:44:14.156
THE COURTS. THAT'S THE ONLY

08:44:14.222 --> 08:44:15.390
AMENDMENT I'VE BEEN I'VE

08:44:15.457 --> 08:44:17.926
RECEIVED. AND IN FACT, I DID WAS

08:44:17.993 --> 08:44:20.562
WE SENT IT UP TO OUR ALLEGED

08:44:20.629 --> 08:44:22.297
COUNSEL ON ENSURING WHAT THEY

08:44:22.364 --> 08:44:24.132
REQUESTED OF ME, OF THE COURTS I

08:44:24.199 --> 08:44:26.268
WAS GOING TO DO AS AN AUTHOR

08:44:26.334 --> 08:44:26.902
AMENDMENT GOT DISTRACTED WITH

08:44:26.968 --> 08:44:27.969
ALL THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS

08:44:28.036 --> 08:44:29.237
THAT WE WERE GOING BACK AND

08:44:29.304 --> 08:44:31.640
FORTH, THAT I DID NOT SUBMIT

08:44:31.706 --> 08:44:32.507
AMENDMENTS TO THE COMMITTEE.

08:44:32.574 --> 08:44:34.876
THAT IS MY FAULT. SO WE ARE

08:44:34.943 --> 08:44:36.511
PREPARED TO DO OTHER AMENDMENTS

08:44:36.578 --> 08:44:38.580
ON THE FLOOR TO ADDRESS THE

08:44:38.647 --> 08:44:40.682
COURT'S, TO ADDRESS THEIR

08:44:40.749 --> 08:44:42.284
CONCERN OF REMAINING OF KEEPING

08:44:42.350 --> 08:44:44.686
THAT RELATIONSHIP. ADDITIONALLY,

08:44:44.753 --> 08:44:47.355
IN THE L.A. COUNTY'S MOTION TO

08:44:47.422 --> 08:44:49.057
SUPPORT THIS BILL, THEY DICTATED

08:44:49.124 --> 08:44:50.725
AND PUT THAT THE RELATIONSHIP

08:44:50.792 --> 08:44:53.028
BETWEEN LA PROBATION AND COURTS

08:44:53.094 --> 08:44:54.863
WERE NOT GOING TO CHANGE

08:44:54.930 --> 08:44:56.131
WHATSOEVER. AND THE COURTS ARE

08:44:56.198 --> 08:44:57.599
ASKING ME TO MATCH THAT

08:44:57.666 --> 08:44:58.834
RELATIONSHIP TO ENSURE

08:44:58.900 --> 08:45:00.669
CONTINUITY OF CARE REMAINS. AND

08:45:00.735 --> 08:45:02.637
THE WHOLE ROLE IS TO ENSURE THAT

08:45:02.704 --> 08:45:04.072
PROBATION CAN STILL PROVIDE

08:45:04.139 --> 08:45:05.307
RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE COURT,

08:45:05.373 --> 08:45:07.475
BUT ALSO ALLOW THE OPPORTUNITY

08:45:07.542 --> 08:45:09.010
FOR, IN THIS CASE, D D

08:45:09.077 --> 08:45:10.879
DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH DEVELOPMENT

08:45:10.946 --> 08:45:12.814
TO ALSO PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS

08:45:12.881 --> 08:45:13.882
AS WELL. AND THE AMENDMENT I

08:45:13.949 --> 08:45:15.917
WANT TO REMIND THAT WE TOOK FROM

08:45:15.984 --> 08:45:18.320
THIS COMMITTEE STATES THAT THIS

08:45:18.386 --> 08:45:22.090
WILL RESULT IN NO LOSS OF

08:45:22.157 --> 08:45:23.225
REPRESENTATIVE STAFF CURRENTLY

08:45:23.291 --> 08:45:24.893
EMPLOYED BY COUNTY PROBATION.

08:45:24.960 --> 08:45:26.761
NOT A SINGLE LOSS FROM COUNTY

08:45:26.828 --> 08:45:28.330
PROBATION WILL HAPPEN. SO

08:45:28.396 --> 08:45:30.532
THEY'RE STILL GOING TO BE IN

08:45:30.599 --> 08:45:31.433
THESE JUVENILE HALLS. IT'S JUST

08:45:31.499 --> 08:45:32.934
THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN CHARGE OF

08:45:33.001 --> 08:45:36.137
THE SECURITY OF IT. LET OTHER

08:45:36.204 --> 08:45:37.606
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE MORE, WHO

08:45:37.672 --> 08:45:39.074
ARE TRAINED ON THE SOCIAL

08:45:39.140 --> 08:45:40.375
SERVICES OF THINGS TO PROVIDE

08:45:40.442 --> 08:45:43.378
THE REHABILITATIVE,

08:45:43.445 --> 08:45:44.846
REHABILITATIVE PORTION OF THE

08:45:44.913 --> 08:45:47.816
SERVICES IN THEIR HOUSE. THANK

08:45:47.883 --> 08:45:49.851
YOU, MR. HANEY. ANYTHING ELSE?

08:45:49.918 --> 08:45:51.319
THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND THAT

08:45:51.386 --> 08:45:53.455
THAT IS AND I KNOW THAT. AND I

08:45:53.521 --> 08:45:54.890
APPRECIATE THE CONTINUED WORK ON

08:45:54.956 --> 08:45:56.291
THIS AND ALL OF THE WORK THAT

08:45:56.358 --> 08:45:57.893
HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE. AND IT

08:45:57.959 --> 08:45:59.027
SOUNDS LIKE THERE IS A

08:45:59.094 --> 08:46:01.096
COMMITMENT THERE, BOTH TO WORK

08:46:01.162 --> 08:46:04.199
WITH THE COURTS AND AS WELL AS,

08:46:04.266 --> 08:46:07.135
I WOULD HOPE, THE PROBATION

08:46:07.202 --> 08:46:08.703
OFFICERS AND THE STAFF IN TERMS

08:46:08.770 --> 08:46:10.005
OF HOW THIS WOULD OPERATE. SOME

08:46:10.071 --> 08:46:11.973
OF THESE AMENDMENTS, I WAS

08:46:12.040 --> 08:46:13.441
GETTING TEXTS AND CALLS THAT

08:46:13.508 --> 08:46:14.809
THAT FOLKS WHO SHOULD DEFINITELY

08:46:14.876 --> 08:46:16.611
BE INVOLVED IN IN THIS PROCESS,

08:46:16.678 --> 08:46:18.179
YOU KNOW, MOVING FORWARD, HADN'T

08:46:18.246 --> 08:46:20.682
SEEN THE AMENDMENTS AND SOME OF

08:46:20.749 --> 08:46:22.183
THEM WERE INTENDED TO SUPPORT

08:46:22.250 --> 08:46:23.785
THEIR INVOLVEMENT AND ADDRESS

08:46:23.852 --> 08:46:25.120
SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS. AND I

08:46:25.186 --> 08:46:27.055
KNOW THAT HAPPENS. I'M NOT

08:46:27.122 --> 08:46:28.089
BLAMING ANYONE FOR THAT. THAT

08:46:28.156 --> 08:46:29.024
HAPPENS IN MY COMMITTEE TOO.

08:46:29.090 --> 08:46:30.892
THAT'S NOT ANYBODY'S FAULT IN

08:46:30.959 --> 08:46:32.794
PARTICULAR, BUT IT DOES SPEAK TO

08:46:32.861 --> 08:46:34.496
THE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS THAT

08:46:34.562 --> 08:46:35.864
THAT THAT NEED TO HAPPEN WITH

08:46:35.931 --> 08:46:37.799
THE FOLKS WHO WILL BE IMPACTED,

08:46:37.866 --> 08:46:40.568
I WONDER JUST IF, IF, IF, IF

08:46:40.635 --> 08:46:42.637
THROUGH THE CHAIR, THAT IF THE

08:46:42.704 --> 08:46:44.072
OPPOSITION COULD ALSO ADDRESS

08:46:44.139 --> 08:46:46.675
THIS QUESTION OF, YOU KNOW,

08:46:46.741 --> 08:46:49.644
WHETHER HAVING ONE COUNTY, YOU

08:46:49.711 --> 08:46:51.613
KNOW, LARGEST COUNTY WHO DOESN'T

08:46:51.680 --> 08:46:53.214
HAVE THESE RESPONSIBILITIES

08:46:53.281 --> 08:46:54.382
WITHIN A DEPARTMENT THAT EVERY

08:46:54.449 --> 08:46:56.885
OTHER COUNTY HAS, WHAT WE WOULD

08:46:56.952 --> 08:46:58.987
NEED TO BE CHANGE, WHAT WOULD

08:46:59.054 --> 08:47:01.056
WHAT SORT OF IMPACTS THAT THAT

08:47:01.122 --> 08:47:03.258
WILL HAVE. AND MAYBE RESPONDING

08:47:03.325 --> 08:47:04.893
TO THE TO THE AUTHOR'S POINTS

08:47:04.960 --> 08:47:07.495
THERE, IF I MAY, THROUGH THE

08:47:07.562 --> 08:47:09.030
CHAIR. IT'S A REALLY, I THINK,

08:47:09.097 --> 08:47:09.898
IMPORTANT QUESTION WHEN YOU TALK

08:47:09.965 --> 08:47:11.599
ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THERE ARE

08:47:11.666 --> 08:47:12.534
STANDARDS AND QUALIFICATIONS

08:47:12.600 --> 08:47:13.501
THAT APPLY STATEWIDE, BECAUSE

08:47:13.568 --> 08:47:15.470
PART OF WHAT WE HAVE SEEN WITH

08:47:15.537 --> 08:47:16.271
THE LEGISLATURE OVER THE MANY

08:47:16.338 --> 08:47:18.340
YEARS THAT PROBATION HAS BEEN IN

08:47:18.406 --> 08:47:19.541
EXISTENCE IS THE ABILITY TO KIND

08:47:19.607 --> 08:47:20.909
OF SET FORTH SOME POLICY

08:47:20.976 --> 08:47:22.043
DIRECTIONS THAT THEY WANT TO SEE

08:47:22.110 --> 08:47:23.611
CARRIED OUT STATEWIDE. AND SOME

08:47:23.678 --> 08:47:25.080
OF THOSE THINGS ARE AROUND

08:47:25.146 --> 08:47:26.281
REGULATIONS OF FACILITIES,

08:47:26.348 --> 08:47:27.649
MINIMUM TRAINING OF OUR

08:47:27.716 --> 08:47:28.817
OFFICERS, BOTH FROM A PEACE

08:47:28.883 --> 08:47:30.352
OFFICER PERSPECTIVE, BUT ALSO

08:47:30.418 --> 08:47:32.587
THE DUTIES WE HAVE WITH THE

08:47:32.654 --> 08:47:33.688
COURT AROUND JUVENILE

08:47:33.755 --> 08:47:35.156
CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND

08:47:35.223 --> 08:47:36.725
HOW TO MANAGE DE-ESCALATION AND

08:47:36.791 --> 08:47:38.760
ALL OF ALL OF THE REALLY

08:47:38.827 --> 08:47:40.195
IMPORTANT ASPECTS TO THAT KIND

08:47:40.261 --> 08:47:41.196
OF YOUTH DEVELOPMENT WORK. THERE

08:47:41.262 --> 08:47:42.731
ARE ALSO EXTENSIVE RULES OF

08:47:42.797 --> 08:47:45.066
COURT. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU LOOK

08:47:45.133 --> 08:47:46.368
THROUGHOUT THE WELFARE AND

08:47:46.434 --> 08:47:47.068
INSTITUTIONS CODE SECTION,

08:47:47.135 --> 08:47:49.537
AGAIN, STATE POLICIES THAT SET

08:47:49.604 --> 08:47:51.206
FORTH WHAT IS TO BE CARRIED OUT

08:47:51.272 --> 08:47:53.241
AS IT RELATES TO OUR JUVENILE

08:47:53.308 --> 08:47:54.342
JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND SO IF YOU

08:47:54.409 --> 08:47:56.177
HAVE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS IN

08:47:56.244 --> 08:47:57.779
DIFFERENT PLACES, THAT IS GOING

08:47:57.846 --> 08:48:00.115
TO HAVE IMPACTS TO BOTH PUBLIC

08:48:00.181 --> 08:48:01.249
SAFETY AND HOW THE COURTS CARRY

08:48:01.316 --> 08:48:03.451
OUT THEIR ORDERS AND HOW THOSE

08:48:03.518 --> 08:48:04.219
THINGS ARE DONE, I DO WANT TO

08:48:04.285 --> 08:48:06.321
JUST BRIEFLY ALSO SPEAK TO THE

08:48:06.388 --> 08:48:07.622
INTER COUNTY TRANSFER ISSUE,

08:48:07.689 --> 08:48:09.057
BECAUSE WE HAVE BOTH COUNTY

08:48:09.124 --> 08:48:10.258
TRANSFERS IN AND OUT OF THE

08:48:10.325 --> 08:48:12.027
STATE. WE HAVE STATE COMPACTS

08:48:12.093 --> 08:48:12.794
FOR YOUTH MOVING AMONG THE

08:48:12.861 --> 08:48:14.029
STATE. BUT WE ALSO HAVE

08:48:14.095 --> 08:48:16.398
INSTANCES WHERE, YOU KNOW, A

08:48:16.464 --> 08:48:17.298
FAMILY IN ONE COUNTY MAY HAVE

08:48:17.365 --> 08:48:18.333
FAMILY THAT MOVES TO ANOTHER

08:48:18.400 --> 08:48:20.268
COUNTY. AND PART OF THAT IS YOU

08:48:20.335 --> 08:48:22.437
HAVE BOTH RULES OF COURT AND

08:48:22.504 --> 08:48:23.471
STATUTE THAT GOVERN HOW THE

08:48:23.538 --> 08:48:24.839
JURISDICTION OF THAT JUVENILE

08:48:24.906 --> 08:48:26.775
CASE IS TRANSFERRED TO MAKE SURE

08:48:26.841 --> 08:48:28.109
THAT THE SERVICES CAN BE

08:48:28.176 --> 08:48:29.644
PROVIDED IN THEIR COUNTY OF

08:48:29.711 --> 08:48:31.613
RESIDENCE AND CLOSE TO HOME. YOU

08:48:31.679 --> 08:48:32.180
ALSO HAVE INSTANCES WHERE A

08:48:32.247 --> 08:48:34.249
YOUTH MAY TRAVEL FOR VACATION

08:48:34.315 --> 08:48:36.484
SOMEWHERE, HAVE A HAVE A CHARGE,

08:48:36.551 --> 08:48:37.919
AN OFFENSE, AND BUT THAT'S NOT

08:48:37.986 --> 08:48:39.821
THE COUNTY IN WHICH THAT THEY

08:48:39.888 --> 08:48:41.289
LIVE. AND SO THESE THINGS ARE

08:48:41.356 --> 08:48:43.224
HAPPENING ALL OF THE TIME. IT'S

08:48:43.291 --> 08:48:44.426
NOT MOU BASED THEIR STATUTE.

08:48:44.492 --> 08:48:45.760
THERE'S RULES OF COURT. AND SO

08:48:45.827 --> 08:48:47.495
THOSE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE

08:48:47.562 --> 08:48:49.097
HAPPENING UNDER THIS. AND SO HOW

08:48:49.164 --> 08:48:49.998
DO WE MAKE SURE, YOU KNOW THOSE

08:48:50.065 --> 08:48:52.033
AREN'T IMPACTED IN A WAY THAT

08:48:52.100 --> 08:48:53.802
JURISDICTION AND SUPERVISION AND

08:48:53.868 --> 08:48:56.204
SERVICES AREN'T AT THE DETRIMENT

08:48:56.271 --> 08:48:57.906
OF THE YOUTH AND COMMUNITY

08:48:57.972 --> 08:49:01.009
SAFETY. IF ANY. ANYTHING ELSE IN

08:49:01.076 --> 08:49:03.044
MR. HANEY, IS THERE AN

08:49:03.111 --> 08:49:04.245
ADDITIONAL ANSWER? YEAH. WELL,

08:49:04.312 --> 08:49:07.449
IN RESPONSE TO THE SENATOR, SHE

08:49:07.515 --> 08:49:09.984
RESPONDED TO HIS QUESTION AND

08:49:10.051 --> 08:49:11.986
ALSO STIPULATED THAT SHE REACHED

08:49:12.053 --> 08:49:13.455
OUT AND NO AMENDMENTS CAME FROM

08:49:13.521 --> 08:49:16.257
THE OPPOSITION. A LOT OF TIMES

08:49:16.324 --> 08:49:17.859
YOU CAN'T MAKE AMENDMENTS UNTIL

08:49:17.926 --> 08:49:19.394
SOMETHING IS CLEAR. AND I

08:49:19.461 --> 08:49:21.496
MENTIONED THAT IN ANY BILL THERE

08:49:21.563 --> 08:49:23.298
SHOULD BE CLARITY. FOR INSTANCE,

08:49:23.364 --> 08:49:24.899
SHE MADE THE STATEMENT THAT

08:49:24.966 --> 08:49:27.302
THERE WOULD BE NO LOSS OF ANY

08:49:27.368 --> 08:49:28.970
CURRENT OFFICERS. RIGHT. AND

08:49:29.037 --> 08:49:30.438
REMEMBER I SAID I WAS

08:49:30.505 --> 08:49:32.340
REPRESENTING A UNION ALSO AS A

08:49:32.407 --> 08:49:36.244
AS A PROBATION OFFICER? NO, NO

08:49:36.311 --> 08:49:37.912
CURRENT OFFICER PROBABLY

08:49:37.979 --> 08:49:38.847
WOULDN'T LOSE THEIR JOB. BUT

08:49:38.913 --> 08:49:40.949
WHAT IF THEY ARE STRETCHING OUT?

08:49:41.015 --> 08:49:42.817
THAT ITEM WOULD BE LOST IN TERMS

08:49:42.884 --> 08:49:44.853
OF A PROBATION OFFICER AND

08:49:44.919 --> 08:49:47.122
REPLACED WITH A NON PROBATION

08:49:47.188 --> 08:49:49.858
OFFICER. THAT IS DILUTING THE

08:49:49.924 --> 08:49:51.626
PROFESSION. THAT'S WHY I SAY

08:49:51.693 --> 08:49:53.528
IT'S AN ATTACK ON PROBATION. IF

08:49:53.595 --> 08:49:55.096
EVERY OFFICER WAS TO RETIRE

08:49:55.163 --> 08:49:57.132
TODAY IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY,

08:49:57.198 --> 08:49:59.234
THEN THEY WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT

08:49:59.300 --> 08:50:00.435
TO REPLACE EVERY OFFICER WITH A

08:50:00.502 --> 08:50:02.237
NON-LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER.

08:50:02.303 --> 08:50:02.971
THEREFORE, YOU WOULD HAVE TO

08:50:03.037 --> 08:50:05.373
CHANGE ALL THE LAWS ON WHO COULD

08:50:05.440 --> 08:50:06.207
DO THE REPRESENTATION. IF YOU

08:50:06.274 --> 08:50:08.243
TALK ABOUT LOSS OF JOBS,

08:50:08.309 --> 08:50:09.978
ACCESSING RECORDS, WHICH WE CALL

08:50:10.044 --> 08:50:12.313
A VIOLATION, WE HAVE CRIMINAL

08:50:12.380 --> 08:50:14.816
OFFENDERS INFORMATION THAT WE

08:50:14.883 --> 08:50:17.385
HAVE UNDER SECURITY. IF YOU GAVE

08:50:17.452 --> 08:50:20.355
THAT ACCESS TO THOSE WHO HAVE

08:50:20.421 --> 08:50:21.923
NOT BEEN STIPULATED BY STATE

08:50:21.990 --> 08:50:24.526
LAW, THEN YOU HAVE IN FACT

08:50:24.592 --> 08:50:26.594
ALLOWED ANOTHER PERSON TO DO

08:50:26.661 --> 08:50:28.763
THAT JOB, WHICH BELONGS TO A

08:50:28.830 --> 08:50:30.865
PEACE OFFICER. SO WHEN I SAY

08:50:30.932 --> 08:50:32.734
IT'S AN ATTACK ON PROBATION, THE

08:50:32.800 --> 08:50:35.236
BILL IN ITSELF, WE DON'T

08:50:35.303 --> 08:50:37.105
DISAGREE THAT THERE ARE PROBLEMS

08:50:37.172 --> 08:50:39.107
IN PROBATION. WHAT WE DISAGREE

08:50:39.174 --> 08:50:41.376
WITH IS IT IS PROBATION. THAT

08:50:41.442 --> 08:50:43.912
SHOULD BE THE ENTITY THAT THE

08:50:43.978 --> 08:50:46.247
STATE HAS ALREADY DICTATED TO

08:50:46.314 --> 08:50:49.317
HELP REFORM YOUTH. NOW, THERE

08:50:49.384 --> 08:50:51.619
WAS TALK ALSO ABOUT

08:50:51.686 --> 08:50:52.554
PROFESSIONALISM AND THERAPEUTICS

08:50:52.620 --> 08:50:55.857
AND BEING ABLE TO PRESENT THAT

08:50:55.924 --> 08:50:57.825
85% OF ALL OF THE OFFICERS IN

08:50:57.892 --> 08:50:59.294
LOS ANGELES COUNTY HAVE A FOUR

08:50:59.360 --> 08:51:01.095
YEAR DEGREE. THAT DOESN'T MEAN

08:51:01.162 --> 08:51:02.197
THAT THEY'RE THE SMARTEST PEOPLE

08:51:02.263 --> 08:51:04.199
IN THE WORLD, BUT IT DOES MEAN

08:51:04.265 --> 08:51:05.433
THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH

08:51:05.500 --> 08:51:07.702
AND ADAPT TO WHATEVER REFORMS WE

08:51:07.769 --> 08:51:11.039
WANT TO DO. DIALECTICAL

08:51:11.105 --> 08:51:13.441
BEHAVIOR, CBT, WE INVOLVE ALL OF

08:51:13.508 --> 08:51:15.944
THAT. PROBATION IS THE LEAST

08:51:16.010 --> 08:51:17.812
RESTRICTED LAW ENFORCEMENT

08:51:17.879 --> 08:51:19.681
AGENCY IN THE STATE OF

08:51:19.747 --> 08:51:21.749
CALIFORNIA. IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY

08:51:21.816 --> 08:51:23.685
FOR YOUTH TO BE REFORMED. IT IS

08:51:23.751 --> 08:51:26.087
NOT A SUPPRESSION OF YOUTH. I'M

08:51:26.154 --> 08:51:27.889
ALSO 50 YEAR RESIDENT. I'M

08:51:27.956 --> 08:51:28.957
CONCERNED ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY.

08:51:29.023 --> 08:51:30.592
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT HOW WE

08:51:30.658 --> 08:51:32.961
RETURN OUR YOUTH TO THE

08:51:33.027 --> 08:51:34.562
COMMUNITY. I LIVE AMONGST THEM.

08:51:34.629 --> 08:51:36.264
AND SO QUITE NATURALLY, I WANT

08:51:36.331 --> 08:51:38.233
THEM TO HAVE THE BEST TREATMENT.

08:51:38.299 --> 08:51:40.802
IT IS THE UNIONS THAT SENT A

08:51:40.868 --> 08:51:43.137
BILL UP HERE TWO YEARS AGO, AB

08:51:43.204 --> 08:51:46.207
SIX, $95 BILLION WE ASKED FOR.

08:51:46.274 --> 08:51:48.276
THAT'S WHEN WE HAD A SURPLUS, OF

08:51:48.343 --> 08:51:50.078
COURSE. WHY? BECAUSE THE

08:51:50.144 --> 08:51:51.946
FACILITIES DO NOT REPRESENT

08:51:52.013 --> 08:51:53.114
THERAPEUTICS. YOU CAN'T BLAME

08:51:53.181 --> 08:51:55.216
THE OFFICERS. FOR WHAT? A

08:51:55.283 --> 08:51:56.684
FACILITY. IF YOU GOT A FACILITY

08:51:56.751 --> 08:51:58.486
IN THE HALLS, ESPECIALLY WHEN

08:51:58.553 --> 08:52:00.622
EACH PERSON DOESN'T HAVE ITS OWN

08:52:00.688 --> 08:52:02.090
RESTROOM, THAT WAS A BIG ISSUE

08:52:02.156 --> 08:52:03.925
RIGHT THEN. YOU CANNOT TALK

08:52:03.992 --> 08:52:06.394
ABOUT IT BEING THE ENVIRONMENT

08:52:06.461 --> 08:52:09.264
THAT IS CAUSED FOR REFORM. SO I

08:52:09.330 --> 08:52:10.331
JUST WANTED TO ADDRESS THOSE

08:52:10.398 --> 08:52:12.166
ISSUES BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THE

08:52:12.233 --> 08:52:14.002
BILL IS CLEAR. I THINK THE BILL

08:52:14.068 --> 08:52:15.803
IS AN ATTACK ON PROBATION.

08:52:15.870 --> 08:52:17.905
PROBATION IS A STATE MANDATED

08:52:17.972 --> 08:52:19.874
ENTITY. AND AGAIN, YOU MAY SOME

08:52:19.941 --> 08:52:21.876
OF YOU ARE PRETTY YOUNG. IF YOU

08:52:21.943 --> 08:52:23.444
GO BACK AND PULL THE PROBATION

08:52:23.511 --> 08:52:26.547
SERVICES TASK FORCE REPORT, 549

08:52:26.614 --> 08:52:28.950
PAGES LONG, 17 RECOMMENDATIONS

08:52:29.017 --> 08:52:30.585
IN THOSE 17 RECOMMENDATIONS AT

08:52:30.652 --> 08:52:33.021
THAT TIME, IF THE STATE AND THE

08:52:33.087 --> 08:52:34.822
COUNTIES WOULD ABIDE BY THOSE

08:52:34.889 --> 08:52:35.890
RECOMMENDATIONS, WE WOULDN'T BE

08:52:35.957 --> 08:52:37.659
HERE TODAY. WE WOULD HAVE

08:52:37.725 --> 08:52:39.460
MINIMUM NEGATIVE ASPECTS IN OUR

08:52:39.527 --> 08:52:42.630
DEPARTMENT. ANYTHING ELSE, MR.

08:52:42.697 --> 08:52:44.532
HANEY? YEAH, JUST JUST JUST JUST

08:52:44.599 --> 08:52:46.434
TO CLOSE ON, I, I APPRECIATE ALL

08:52:46.501 --> 08:52:49.170
OF THAT. I THINK THERE, THERE

08:52:49.237 --> 08:52:51.139
THERE ARE A LOT OF REASONS WHY

08:52:51.205 --> 08:52:53.174
WE COLLECTIVELY HAVE GOT THIS

08:52:53.241 --> 08:52:55.276
WRONG OVER A NUMBER OF DECADES.

08:52:55.343 --> 08:52:57.445
AND IT'S WE GOT IT WRONG, NOT

08:52:57.512 --> 08:52:59.614
JUST IN LA. WE GOT IT WRONG IN

08:52:59.681 --> 08:53:01.382
SAN FRANCISCO. WE GOT IT WRONG

08:53:01.449 --> 08:53:03.384
THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND I

08:53:03.451 --> 08:53:06.187
DON'T THINK THAT FOR ALL OF US

08:53:06.254 --> 08:53:07.822
TO SIT HERE IN THIS BUILDING

08:53:07.889 --> 08:53:09.657
WHERE WE PASSED THE LAWS THAT

08:53:09.724 --> 08:53:11.225
CREATED THESE FRAMEWORKS, WE

08:53:11.292 --> 08:53:12.560
PASSED THE LAWS FOR DECADES THAT

08:53:12.627 --> 08:53:14.629
CREATED THESE INCREDIBLY

08:53:14.696 --> 08:53:16.564
PUNITIVE, DANGEROUS FACILITIES

08:53:16.631 --> 08:53:18.433
FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND SET UP A

08:53:18.499 --> 08:53:19.934
CERTAIN WAY THAT WE WERE DEALING

08:53:20.001 --> 08:53:21.369
WITH THEM THAT WAS VERY HARMFUL

08:53:21.436 --> 08:53:23.071
AND VERY DANGEROUS, THAT WE

08:53:23.137 --> 08:53:25.540
SHOULD SIT UP HERE NOW AND SAY,

08:53:25.606 --> 08:53:29.143
NO, IT'S THE PEOPLE IN PROBATION

08:53:29.210 --> 08:53:31.045
WHO'VE DEDICATED THEIR LIVES TO

08:53:31.112 --> 08:53:32.447
THAT WORK. AND IT'S THEIR IT'S

08:53:32.513 --> 08:53:34.649
THEIR FAULT WHEN THEY'RE BEING

08:53:34.716 --> 08:53:37.151
SENT INTO THESE FACILITIES THAT

08:53:37.218 --> 08:53:38.052
THEMSELVES HAD A CERTAIN MISSION

08:53:38.119 --> 08:53:39.887
AND MANDATE THAT WERE DANGEROUS

08:53:39.954 --> 08:53:42.256
AND FACILITIES IN MANY CASES

08:53:42.323 --> 08:53:44.225
THAT DID NOT, THAT WERE NOT SET

08:53:44.292 --> 08:53:45.760
UP TO HELP PEOPLE, BUT OFTEN

08:53:45.827 --> 08:53:47.261
HURT PEOPLE AND, AND THE LACK OF

08:53:47.328 --> 08:53:48.629
SERVICES, AS YOU SAID,

08:53:48.696 --> 08:53:50.665
THERAPEUTIC OPPORTUNITIES. SO I

08:53:50.732 --> 08:53:53.167
THINK THAT WE, WE HAVE TO FIGURE

08:53:53.234 --> 08:53:55.136
OUT HOW TO GET THIS RIGHT. AND I

08:53:55.203 --> 08:53:57.372
THAT'S WHY I COMMEND THE AUTHOR

08:53:57.438 --> 08:53:59.240
AND COMMEND THE BOARD FOR, FOR

08:53:59.307 --> 08:54:01.275
LOOKING AT THE WAYS TO MAKE THE

08:54:01.342 --> 08:54:03.478
BIGGER CHANGES THAT WE NEED AND

08:54:03.544 --> 08:54:04.846
THE LA MEMBERS AND THE LA

08:54:04.912 --> 08:54:06.914
AUTHOR. I'M THIS WILL ONLY APPLY

08:54:06.981 --> 08:54:09.617
TO LA. I'M GOING TO DEFER TO YOU

08:54:09.684 --> 08:54:10.551
ALL TO CONTINUE THIS

08:54:10.618 --> 08:54:11.953
CONVERSATION. BUT I DO THINK

08:54:12.019 --> 08:54:15.623
THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW

08:54:15.690 --> 08:54:17.692
WE ADDRESS ALL OF THESE BROADER

08:54:17.759 --> 08:54:19.293
ISSUES JUST BY CHANGING A

08:54:19.360 --> 08:54:21.362
DEPARTMENT. THAT FEELS TO ME NOT

08:54:21.429 --> 08:54:22.930
LIKE IT'S GOING TO CHANGE. WHAT

08:54:22.997 --> 08:54:25.466
IS A DEEPER SET OF CHALLENGES

08:54:25.533 --> 08:54:26.467
THAT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED THAT HAVE

08:54:26.534 --> 08:54:28.569
TO BE DONE WITH THE PEOPLE WHO

08:54:28.636 --> 08:54:30.037
ARE DOING THE WORK NOW AND

08:54:30.104 --> 08:54:30.805
PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES, AND

08:54:30.872 --> 08:54:31.939
HAVE DEDICATED THEIR LIFE TO

08:54:32.006 --> 08:54:33.775
THAT, AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE

08:54:33.841 --> 08:54:35.109
FULLY AT THE TABLE AS WELL AS

08:54:35.176 --> 08:54:36.144
ADDRESSING THESE BROADER ISSUES.

08:54:36.210 --> 08:54:38.613
BUT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE

08:54:38.679 --> 08:54:40.982
BILL TODAY, AND I KNOW THAT AND

08:54:41.048 --> 08:54:42.917
SORRY TO SPEND SO MUCH TIME

08:54:42.984 --> 08:54:44.619
SPEAKING, BUT I, I HOPE THAT

08:54:44.685 --> 08:54:45.987
THIS CONVERSATION CONTINUES WITH

08:54:46.053 --> 08:54:47.955
ALL OF THESE FOLKS HERE. AND I

08:54:48.022 --> 08:54:50.625
WISH THAT WE ACCOMPLISH WHAT WE

08:54:50.691 --> 08:54:52.126
ALL WANT TO ACCOMPLISH, WHICH IS

08:54:52.193 --> 08:54:53.060
TO KEEP OUR YOUNG PEOPLE SAFE

08:54:53.127 --> 08:54:55.196
AND KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE, AND

08:54:55.263 --> 08:54:57.331
THAT WE FIND THE BEST WAY TO DO

08:54:57.398 --> 08:54:58.800
THAT. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR.

08:54:58.866 --> 08:54:59.600
THANK YOU, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

08:54:59.667 --> 08:55:01.369
HANEY. MR. VICE CHAIR, YOU'VE

08:55:01.436 --> 08:55:03.171
BEEN WAITING. THE FLOOR IS

08:55:03.237 --> 08:55:09.377
YOURS. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. SO

08:55:09.444 --> 08:55:11.045
I DON'T LIVE IN LA COUNTY, BUT

08:55:11.112 --> 08:55:12.280
LA COUNTY SEEMS TO BRING ISSUES

08:55:12.346 --> 08:55:14.081
HERE ALL THE TIME BECAUSE THEY

08:55:14.148 --> 08:55:15.550
CAN'T FIX IT THEMSELVES. AND WE

08:55:15.616 --> 08:55:17.018
I, WE ALWAYS SEEM TO SEEM TO BE

08:55:17.084 --> 08:55:19.420
THE FIX. I DON'T KNOW WHY. WE

08:55:19.487 --> 08:55:20.421
JUST DON'T HOLD OUR ELECTED

08:55:20.488 --> 08:55:21.222
OFFICIALS ACCOUNTABLE IN LOS

08:55:21.289 --> 08:55:23.191
ANGELES TO MAKE SURE THEY FIX

08:55:23.257 --> 08:55:24.192
THIS, BUT KEEP BRINGING IT TO

08:55:24.258 --> 08:55:27.094
THE STATE AND HAVE THE STATE DO

08:55:27.161 --> 08:55:28.129
IT. THESE NON PEACE OFFICERS

08:55:28.196 --> 08:55:29.096
THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE BRINGING

08:55:29.163 --> 08:55:31.666
IN OR YOU WANT TO BRING IN IN

08:55:31.732 --> 08:55:33.634
THE BILL, DO THEY GO THROUGH

08:55:33.701 --> 08:55:35.069
BACKGROUNDS. THEY GET BETTER

08:55:35.136 --> 08:55:39.006
LIKE ANY COUNTY EMPLOYEE RIGHT

08:55:39.073 --> 08:55:39.907
NOW. BECAUSE THEY'RE COUNTY

08:55:39.974 --> 08:55:41.075
EMPLOYEES. BUT THEY'RE GOING TO

08:55:41.142 --> 08:55:42.877
BE COUNTY EMPLOYEES. BUT THEY'LL

08:55:42.944 --> 08:55:44.479
BE HOLDING A DIFFERENT,

08:55:44.545 --> 08:55:45.880
DIFFERENT TITLE. THEY'LL BE IN

08:55:45.947 --> 08:55:47.615
THEY'LL BE IN THE FACILITY WITH

08:55:47.682 --> 08:55:48.883
OUR CHILDREN. THEY'RE IN THE

08:55:48.950 --> 08:55:50.751
FACILITIES RIGHT NOW. OKAY. SO

08:55:50.818 --> 08:55:51.953
WHAT WILL THEY BE DOING WITH

08:55:52.019 --> 08:55:54.322
THIS BILL? WHAT WILL THEY BE

08:55:54.388 --> 08:55:55.189
DOING IN THE CAMPS, IN THE

08:55:55.256 --> 08:55:56.958
HALLS? SO SOMETIMES THEY DON'T

08:55:57.024 --> 08:55:58.960
GET PERMISSION TO GO INSIDE THE

08:55:59.026 --> 08:56:00.161
HALLS. SOMETIMES THEY DO. IT'S

08:56:00.228 --> 08:56:02.163
UP TO PROBATION. IF THEY WHOEVER

08:56:02.230 --> 08:56:03.631
THEY WANT TO DECIDE TO GO

08:56:03.698 --> 08:56:05.199
INSIDE. NOW, IF THIS BILL WERE

08:56:05.266 --> 08:56:06.567
TO PASS, YOU WOULD HAVE A

08:56:06.634 --> 08:56:08.336
DISCUSSION. MOU DUTIES WOULD BE

08:56:08.402 --> 08:56:10.371
BROKEN UP BETWEEN PROBATION AND

08:56:10.438 --> 08:56:11.539
DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH DEVELOPMENT

08:56:11.606 --> 08:56:13.040
THROUGH LA COUNTY. THAT COULD

08:56:13.107 --> 08:56:14.475
TAKE YEARS. THAT COULD TAKE

08:56:14.542 --> 08:56:15.443
MONTHS, HOWEVER LONG THAT TAKES

08:56:15.510 --> 08:56:17.311
TO DO THOSE DETERMINATIONS. NOW,

08:56:17.378 --> 08:56:20.281
IF D D IS GIVEN A ROLE OF X, Y,

08:56:20.348 --> 08:56:21.883
Z, THEN THE COUNTY WOULD THEN

08:56:21.949 --> 08:56:23.718
HAVE TO PUT MORE STRINGENT

08:56:23.784 --> 08:56:25.286
BACKGROUND CHECKS, MORE

08:56:25.353 --> 08:56:27.088
STRINGENT PROCESS TO GET

08:56:27.154 --> 08:56:28.556
INDIVIDUALS INTO THOSE ROLES.

08:56:28.623 --> 08:56:29.991
BECAUSE D IS NOT A BIG

08:56:30.057 --> 08:56:31.325
DEPARTMENT RIGHT NOW, BUT IT

08:56:31.392 --> 08:56:34.328
WOULD HAVE TO HIRE UP. BUT THIS

08:56:34.395 --> 08:56:35.830
BILL WOULD MAKE THEM A BIGGER

08:56:35.897 --> 08:56:36.898
DEPARTMENT. THIS BILL IS

08:56:36.964 --> 08:56:38.599
PERMISSIVE. SO FOR THE FIRST

08:56:38.666 --> 08:56:40.601
THING THIS BILL COULD DO IS TO

08:56:40.668 --> 08:56:41.636
BRING THOSE PEOPLE TOGETHER IN A

08:56:41.702 --> 08:56:43.070
TABLE AND SAY, HEY, LA COUNTY

08:56:43.137 --> 08:56:46.173
WANTS TO GO AND DO X, Y, Z. NOW

08:56:46.240 --> 08:56:46.941
THESE ARE THE ROLES THAT ARE

08:56:47.008 --> 08:56:49.343
GOING TO BE BROKEN UP BY THESE X

08:56:49.410 --> 08:56:51.279
AMOUNT OF DEPARTMENTS WITH

08:56:51.345 --> 08:56:52.680
PROBATION AND SO FORTH. SO THIS

08:56:52.747 --> 08:56:54.015
IS WHY THE BILL ISN'T

08:56:54.081 --> 08:56:54.715
PRESCRIPTIVE, BECAUSE IT'S UP TO

08:56:54.782 --> 08:56:56.984
THE LA, UP TO LA COUNTY TO

08:56:57.051 --> 08:56:58.686
DETERMINE WHAT THOSE ROLES WILL

08:56:58.753 --> 08:56:59.453
BE. AND THEN DEPENDING ON THOSE

08:56:59.520 --> 08:57:01.188
ROADS THAT LA COUNTY WILL COME

08:57:01.255 --> 08:57:02.857
TOGETHER TO PUT PARAMETERS ON

08:57:02.924 --> 08:57:04.392
THE INDIVIDUALS GOING IN.

08:57:04.458 --> 08:57:05.860
COULDN'T LA COUNTY DO THAT

08:57:05.927 --> 08:57:07.328
WITHOUT US TELLING THEM TO DO

08:57:07.395 --> 08:57:09.096
THAT? NO. STAY IN OUR STATUTE

08:57:09.163 --> 08:57:11.098
RIGHT NOW. IT SAYS THAT ONLY

08:57:11.165 --> 08:57:12.300
PROBATION CAN BE THE LEAD ENTITY

08:57:12.366 --> 08:57:14.068
IN OUR HALLS AND CAMPS, WHICH IS

08:57:14.135 --> 08:57:15.703
WHY WE'RE CHANGING THAT STATUTE.

08:57:15.770 --> 08:57:17.138
SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE CHANGING.

08:57:17.204 --> 08:57:18.472
THAT'S WHY THE STATE'S INVOLVED.

08:57:18.539 --> 08:57:25.046
THAT'S CORRECT OKAY. SO I'M

08:57:25.112 --> 08:57:27.148
CURIOUS. I KNOW WE HAD A LOT OF

08:57:27.214 --> 08:57:29.984
MEETINGS FROM OTHER COUNTIES.

08:57:30.051 --> 08:57:31.452
I'M ASSUMING THAT THEY'RE

08:57:31.519 --> 08:57:32.887
THEY'RE IN OPPOSITION BECAUSE

08:57:32.954 --> 08:57:34.088
THEY'RE IN FEAR THAT THIS IS

08:57:34.155 --> 08:57:36.457
GOING TO HAPPEN TO THEIR COUNTY,

08:57:36.524 --> 08:57:37.992
POTENTIALLY. AND I AND I COULD

08:57:38.059 --> 08:57:39.727
SEE THAT GOING AS WELL. AND AS

08:57:39.794 --> 08:57:41.095
THE POINTS THAT WERE MADE

08:57:41.162 --> 08:57:44.231
EARLIER BY MY COLLEAGUES IN

08:57:44.298 --> 08:57:46.934
REGARDS TO THE PROBLEM'S NOT

08:57:47.001 --> 08:57:48.436
KIND OF REALLY BEING PROBATION'S

08:57:48.502 --> 08:57:49.937
PROBLEM. IT'S BEING MAYBE OUR

08:57:50.004 --> 08:57:53.107
PROBLEMS, MAYBE 109. RIGHT? WE

08:57:53.174 --> 08:57:54.141
ESSENTIALLY MADE PROBATION

08:57:54.208 --> 08:57:56.210
OFFICERS, PAROLE AGENTS AND SO

08:57:56.277 --> 08:57:57.645
WE GIVE THEM EXTRA DUTIES

08:57:57.712 --> 08:57:59.213
WITHOUT THE EXTRA SUPPORT. BUT

08:57:59.280 --> 08:58:00.247
YET SOMEBODY HERE THOUGHT THAT

08:58:00.314 --> 08:58:02.717
WAS A GREAT IDEA. AND NOW WE'RE

08:58:02.783 --> 08:58:05.553
TRYING TO FIX IT. I THINK

08:58:05.620 --> 08:58:06.587
THERE'S OTHER AVENUES THAT WE

08:58:06.654 --> 08:58:08.923
CAN DO TO TRY AND FIX THAT. I

08:58:08.990 --> 08:58:10.791
DON'T I DON'T KNOW IF BRINGING

08:58:10.858 --> 08:58:14.362
IN OTHER NON PEACE OFFICERS AND,

08:58:14.428 --> 08:58:16.530
AND TO DO THAT IS GOING TO BE

08:58:16.597 --> 08:58:19.767
THE SOLUTION. I CAN SEE THE

08:58:19.834 --> 08:58:21.335
POINT THAT THE PROBATION OFFICER

08:58:21.402 --> 08:58:23.437
HERE HAD MADE ABOUT LOSING JOBS.

08:58:23.504 --> 08:58:24.739
YES. CURRENTLY THE ONES THAT

08:58:24.805 --> 08:58:26.974
HAVE THEM WILL KEEP THEIR JOBS.

08:58:27.041 --> 08:58:27.908
BUT THESE NON PEACE OFFICERS

08:58:27.975 --> 08:58:33.981
WILL BE TAKING THEIR POSITIONS.

08:58:34.048 --> 08:58:35.449
MAY I RESPOND TO THAT. YES

08:58:35.516 --> 08:58:37.752
PLEASE. PLEASE. SO WE HAVE AN

08:58:37.818 --> 08:58:38.386
AMENDMENT IN THE BILL THAT SAYS

08:58:38.452 --> 08:58:40.921
NO PEACE OFFICER ROLE CAN BE

08:58:40.988 --> 08:58:42.590
REPLACED BY A NON PEACE OFFICER.

08:58:42.657 --> 08:58:43.424
SO TO THE POINT THAT SOMEONE

08:58:43.491 --> 08:58:44.125
RETIRES THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE

08:58:44.191 --> 08:58:46.694
REPLACED BY A PEACE OFFICER. AND

08:58:46.761 --> 08:58:48.029
SO LET'S JUST SAY THE MAGIC

08:58:48.095 --> 08:58:50.398
NUMBER FOR PROBATION OFFICERS IS

08:58:50.464 --> 08:58:51.799
1000. SO WILL IT STAY 1000 THE

08:58:51.866 --> 08:58:53.601
WHOLE TIME. OR WOULD THIS NEW

08:58:53.668 --> 08:58:55.936
MOU AGREEMENT POSSIBLY BRING IT

08:58:56.003 --> 08:58:57.872
DOWN TO LIKE 500? IT WOULD

08:58:57.938 --> 08:58:58.939
DEPEND. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIGHT.

08:58:59.006 --> 08:59:00.174
IT DEPENDS. THE AMOUNT OF

08:59:00.241 --> 08:59:02.443
JUVENILES ARE IN THE HALLS. IT

08:59:02.510 --> 08:59:03.044
DEPENDS ON WHAT L.A. COUNTY

08:59:03.110 --> 08:59:04.245
DEEMS AS THE NECESSARY TO RUN

08:59:04.311 --> 08:59:05.112
THESE JUVENILE HALLS. THEY'VE

08:59:05.179 --> 08:59:06.847
BEEN HIRING FOR A LONG TIME.

08:59:06.914 --> 08:59:08.115
THEY JUST AREN'T ABLE TO FILL

08:59:08.182 --> 08:59:09.383
THOSE VACANT ROLES. HOWEVER, I

08:59:09.450 --> 08:59:11.218
DO WANT TO AGREE WITH THE

08:59:11.285 --> 08:59:12.887
OPPONENTS TO SAY THAT IT IS A

08:59:12.953 --> 08:59:14.321
VERY DIFFICULT JOB AND THEY'RE

08:59:14.388 --> 08:59:15.289
NOT THERE. NO ONE IS RECEIVING

08:59:15.356 --> 08:59:17.124
THE SUPPORT. NEITHER THE

08:59:17.191 --> 08:59:18.092
JUVENILES OR THE PROBATION

08:59:18.159 --> 08:59:18.793
OFFICERS ARE RECEIVING THE

08:59:18.859 --> 08:59:20.494
SUPPORT TO RUN A FACILITY AS

08:59:20.561 --> 08:59:22.763
ADEQUATE AS IT CAN BE. I'M NOT

08:59:22.830 --> 08:59:23.798
SAYING THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO

08:59:23.864 --> 08:59:26.300
DECIDE TO PUT ON A UNIFORM WITH

08:59:26.367 --> 08:59:29.904
WHATEVER ROLE AREN'T, IN MY

08:59:29.970 --> 08:59:31.605
OPINION, A LITTLE BETTER THAN

08:59:31.672 --> 08:59:33.307
THE REST BECAUSE WE'RE NOT, YOU

08:59:33.374 --> 08:59:34.875
KNOW, IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF

08:59:34.942 --> 08:59:36.343
KIND OF CRAZY TO BE IN THE

08:59:36.410 --> 08:59:37.144
MILITARY OR LAW ENFORCEMENT.

08:59:37.211 --> 08:59:39.313
RIGHT? BUT IT'S TO SAY THAT WE

08:59:39.380 --> 08:59:40.915
KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE HURTING WITH

08:59:40.981 --> 08:59:43.217
STAFFING. YOU NEED SUPPORT. THIS

08:59:43.284 --> 08:59:45.419
IS SUPPLEMENTAL. IT'S NOT TO

08:59:45.486 --> 08:59:46.420
SUPPLEMENT OR THAT'S NOT WORD.

08:59:46.487 --> 08:59:48.089
IT'S A PLANT THING. THAT'S WHAT

08:59:48.155 --> 08:59:53.527
I'M LOOKING FOR. THESE POSITIONS

08:59:53.594 --> 08:59:55.963
WHO WHO OVERSEES THE DEPARTMENT

08:59:56.030 --> 08:59:58.599
OF YOUTH DEVELOPMENT, L.A.

08:59:58.666 --> 09:00:01.469
COUNTY IS A COUNTY DEPARTMENT.

09:00:01.535 --> 09:00:02.369
DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH DEPARTMENT,

09:00:02.436 --> 09:00:03.604
A DEPARTMENT HEAD. I MEAN,

09:00:03.671 --> 09:00:04.772
AGAIN, THERE IS THERE IS AN

09:00:04.839 --> 09:00:06.273
APPOINTED HEAD TO THAT

09:00:06.340 --> 09:00:07.308
DEPARTMENT RIGHT NOW. AND WHO

09:00:07.374 --> 09:00:08.809
APPOINTS THEM? THE COUNTY BOARD

09:00:08.876 --> 09:00:10.745
OF SUPERVISORS. AND HOW LONG? WE

09:00:10.811 --> 09:00:13.380
JUST HAD A BILL ABOUT THAT. HOW

09:00:13.447 --> 09:00:14.014
LONG IS THAT TERM? THERE'S NO

09:00:14.081 --> 09:00:15.983
TERM LIMIT, SIR. SO NO TERM

09:00:16.050 --> 09:00:17.284
LIMIT. INDEFINITE UNTIL UNTIL

09:00:17.351 --> 09:00:20.154
THEY'RE REMOVED BY VOTE THROUGH

09:00:20.221 --> 09:00:21.856
THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS.

09:00:21.922 --> 09:00:23.791
CORRECT. OKAY. SO ANOTHER

09:00:23.858 --> 09:00:24.992
UNAPPOINTED PERSON APPOINTED

09:00:25.059 --> 09:00:27.261
UNELECTED AN APPOINTED POSITION.

09:00:27.328 --> 09:00:28.863
AND HOW DO THEY HOW DOES THE

09:00:28.929 --> 09:00:30.431
DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH DEVELOPMENT,

09:00:30.498 --> 09:00:33.901
HOW DO THEY HOW DOES DISCIPLINE

09:00:33.968 --> 09:00:36.203
WORK FOR THEM? HOW ARE THERE

09:00:36.270 --> 09:00:37.238
ISSUES THAT THAT ARE TAKEN CARE

09:00:37.304 --> 09:00:39.106
OF WITH THEM AS AS THEY WOULD

09:00:39.173 --> 09:00:40.841
WITH PROBATION? I THINK IT'S

09:00:40.908 --> 09:00:42.309
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE WAY

09:00:42.376 --> 09:00:44.512
THE BILL IS WRITTEN, ALL OR SOME

09:00:44.578 --> 09:00:46.413
OF THE DUTIES OF THE CHIEF

09:00:46.480 --> 09:00:48.749
PROBATION OFFICER WILL BE GIVEN

09:00:48.816 --> 09:00:50.584
TO THE DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH

09:00:50.651 --> 09:00:51.485
DEVELOPMENT, BUT NO DUTY THAT IS

09:00:51.552 --> 09:00:53.354
PERFORMED BY A PEACE OFFICER CAN

09:00:53.420 --> 09:00:55.990
BE DELEGATED. SO THEY'RE NOT

09:00:56.056 --> 09:00:57.691
GOING TO BE OPERATING OR

09:00:57.758 --> 09:00:59.059
SECURING THE HALLS OR

09:00:59.126 --> 09:01:00.060
FACILITIES. THAT'S NOT THE

09:01:00.127 --> 09:01:02.863
INTENT OF THIS. THE INTENT IS TO

09:01:02.930 --> 09:01:04.565
ENSURE THAT THE YOUTH ARE

09:01:04.632 --> 09:01:06.433
GETTING CONNECTED TO SERVICES

09:01:06.500 --> 09:01:08.169
THAT THEY NEED. BECAUSE OF THE

09:01:08.235 --> 09:01:09.937
SHORTAGE OF STAFFING, AND EVEN

09:01:10.004 --> 09:01:12.173
WE HAVE TRIED BONUSES TO

09:01:12.239 --> 09:01:13.407
INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO SIGN ON.

09:01:13.474 --> 09:01:15.075
WE CANNOT HIRE ENOUGH. WE WANT

09:01:15.142 --> 09:01:17.511
TO HIRE MORE. AND BECAUSE OF A

09:01:17.578 --> 09:01:19.680
CULTURE OF CALL OUT, THERE'S NOT

09:01:19.747 --> 09:01:21.849
ENOUGH PEOPLE THERE TO BOTH

09:01:21.916 --> 09:01:23.617
SECURE THE FACILITIES AND

09:01:23.684 --> 09:01:24.919
PROVIDE THE YOUTH WITH THE

09:01:24.985 --> 09:01:26.153
SERVICES THEY NEED. AND I THINK

09:01:26.220 --> 09:01:28.289
THE VISION FOR THE BOARD IS THAT

09:01:28.355 --> 09:01:29.356
THIS BILL WOULD DO THAT. IT

09:01:29.423 --> 09:01:31.492
WOULD IT WOULD SUPPORT OUR

09:01:31.559 --> 09:01:32.960
PROBATION OFFICERS BY DOING THE

09:01:33.027 --> 09:01:35.262
THING THAT MAYBE DID DOES

09:01:35.329 --> 09:01:36.564
BETTER, WHICH IS THE SERVICES,

09:01:36.630 --> 09:01:38.699
AND CONNECTING THEM TO THOSE

09:01:38.766 --> 09:01:40.968
SERVICES. AND THE PROBATION

09:01:41.035 --> 09:01:42.336
OFFICERS THERE WILL DO THEIR

09:01:42.403 --> 09:01:44.171
PRIMARY DUTY AS PEACE OFFICERS

09:01:44.238 --> 09:01:45.306
BY SECURING THE FACILITIES. I

09:01:45.372 --> 09:01:46.740
THINK THAT WAS THE VISION. DON'T

09:01:46.807 --> 09:01:48.709
YOU GUYS ALREADY HAVE COMMUNITY

09:01:48.776 --> 09:01:49.310
BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE

09:01:49.376 --> 09:01:51.345
CONTRACTED TO DO THAT THROUGH D

09:01:51.412 --> 09:01:53.047
ID? SO WHAT IS WRONG WITH THEM?

09:01:53.113 --> 09:01:54.281
NOT EVERYONE IS ALLOWED TO

09:01:54.348 --> 09:01:55.749
ENTER. IT'S WHENEVER PROBATION

09:01:55.816 --> 09:01:56.984
FEELS LIKE WHOEVER IS ON DUTY

09:01:57.051 --> 09:01:58.986
THAT DAY GETS TO DECIDE WHO

09:01:59.053 --> 09:02:01.255
BRINGS THEM IN OR NOT. AND SO

09:02:01.322 --> 09:02:02.223
HAVE WE TALKED TO PROBATION

09:02:02.289 --> 09:02:03.490
ABOUT THAT AND MAYBE WORKING

09:02:03.557 --> 09:02:05.860
WITH THEM TO DO THAT. SIR, I'VE

09:02:05.926 --> 09:02:06.493
HAD TWO INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS

09:02:06.560 --> 09:02:08.696
ON THIS. I'VE BEEN WORKING ON

09:02:08.762 --> 09:02:10.097
THIS FOR THREE YEARS, SIR. I'VE

09:02:10.164 --> 09:02:12.299
HAD VARIOUS CONVERSATIONS ON

09:02:12.366 --> 09:02:15.135
THIS. I'VE VISITED I'VE TALKED

09:02:15.202 --> 09:02:16.737
OPPOSITION. DO YOU HAVE A

09:02:16.804 --> 09:02:20.241
RESPONSE TO THAT? YES. FIRST

09:02:20.307 --> 09:02:22.042
THING I'LL SAY, THE D D

09:02:22.109 --> 09:02:23.444
DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH DEVELOPMENT

09:02:23.510 --> 09:02:27.047
CAME INTO EXISTENCE LATE 2022.

09:02:27.114 --> 09:02:30.384
IT HAS YET TO BE ESTABLISHED AS

09:02:30.451 --> 09:02:33.420
AN EVIDENCE BASED ENTITY. THEY

09:02:33.487 --> 09:02:36.490
ARE AND THEY DO HAVE ACCESS

09:02:36.557 --> 09:02:38.559
CURRENTLY INTO THE PROBATION

09:02:38.626 --> 09:02:39.760
DEPARTMENT. SOMETIME THEY ARE

09:02:39.827 --> 09:02:41.528
NOT ALLOWED BECAUSE THEY MAY

09:02:41.595 --> 09:02:44.999
HAVE A FELONY THAT'S STILL WON'T

09:02:45.065 --> 09:02:47.601
ALLOW YOU TO BE AROUND KIDS.

09:02:47.668 --> 09:02:49.203
WAIT A MINUTE. I WAS JUST TOLD

09:02:49.270 --> 09:02:50.537
THERE WAS BACKGROUND CHECKS.

09:02:50.604 --> 09:02:52.206
WELL, AGAIN, THOSE ARE COUNTY

09:02:52.273 --> 09:02:53.507
BACKGROUND CHECKS, NOT PEACE

09:02:53.574 --> 09:02:56.577
OFFICER BACKGROUND CHECKS. LAW

09:02:56.644 --> 09:03:00.915
ENFORCEMENT. ALSO, LOS ANGELES

09:03:00.981 --> 09:03:04.485
COUNTY IN THE LAST 4 TO 5 YEARS

09:03:04.551 --> 09:03:06.854
CONTRACT WITH CBOS TO THE TUNE

09:03:06.921 --> 09:03:09.823
OF OVER $75 MILLION A YEAR. AND

09:03:09.890 --> 09:03:11.625
ALL THE WORK THAT A PEACE

09:03:11.692 --> 09:03:15.296
OFFICER CANNOT DO IS BEING DONE

09:03:15.362 --> 09:03:19.466
BY CBOS AND FBOS AND OTHER

09:03:19.533 --> 09:03:22.503
PEOPLE WHO SUPPLY SPECIALTIES IN

09:03:22.569 --> 09:03:24.271
CERTAIN AREAS, SUCH AS ANGER

09:03:24.338 --> 09:03:26.373
MANAGEMENT, ART HISTORY, THING,

09:03:26.440 --> 09:03:28.142
VOCATIONAL SKILLS. SO WE DO THAT

09:03:28.208 --> 09:03:29.743
ALREADY. AND THAT'S WHY I SAY,

09:03:29.810 --> 09:03:32.112
AGAIN, IF YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK

09:03:32.179 --> 09:03:34.014
AT DOING SOMETHING TO HELP THE

09:03:34.081 --> 09:03:36.550
YOUTH IN CALIFORNIA, PROBATION

09:03:36.617 --> 09:03:38.886
IS THE STATE MANDATED ENTITY.

09:03:38.953 --> 09:03:41.221
THEY ARE REFORMS THAT HAVE NOT

09:03:41.288 --> 09:03:43.290
BEEN ADHERED TO. IT WOULD BE

09:03:43.357 --> 09:03:46.560
BETTER IF THE AUTHOR WOULD WORK

09:03:46.627 --> 09:03:48.462
INSIDE THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT.

09:03:48.529 --> 09:03:49.964
WE ALREADY DO THE THINGS THAT

09:03:50.030 --> 09:03:51.565
THEY ARE ASKING TO BE DONE.

09:03:51.632 --> 09:03:55.402
THERE ARE NO MORE SERVICES THAT

09:03:55.469 --> 09:03:57.705
NEED TO BE DONE BY NON-LAW

09:03:57.771 --> 09:03:59.106
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS THAT ARE

09:03:59.173 --> 09:04:02.242
NOT ALREADY GIVEN TO THE DIED,

09:04:02.309 --> 09:04:05.379
ALONG WITH MANY OTHER CBOS. AND

09:04:05.446 --> 09:04:07.181
SO WE DON'T UNDERSTAND. AGAIN,

09:04:07.247 --> 09:04:09.016
I'LL GO BACK TO THE CLARITY OF

09:04:09.083 --> 09:04:10.517
THE BILL. IF YOU WANT TO ATTACK

09:04:10.584 --> 09:04:13.520
A PROBLEM, ATTACK IT THE PROPER

09:04:13.587 --> 09:04:15.622
WAY. IT'S NOTHING WRONG WITH

09:04:15.689 --> 09:04:17.491
OPPOSING THE BILL OR GOING BACK

09:04:17.558 --> 09:04:19.093
TO THE AUTHOR TO WORK WITH THE

09:04:19.159 --> 09:04:21.562
BILL AND SAY, LOOK, YOU'RE YOU

09:04:21.628 --> 09:04:23.597
MISSED, DIRECTED AND IT'S

09:04:23.664 --> 09:04:25.866
MISLED. AND WE COULD TALK ABOUT

09:04:25.933 --> 09:04:27.434
ALL THE TECHNICALITIES. WE COULD

09:04:27.501 --> 09:04:30.070
TALK ABOUT WHO WHO'S, YOU KNOW,

09:04:30.137 --> 09:04:31.872
WHY DID THIS HAPPEN? YOU KNOW,

09:04:31.939 --> 09:04:34.341
I'VE BEEN EMPLOYED 33 YEARS. I

09:04:34.408 --> 09:04:35.843
CAN TELL YOU FOR YEARS, THE

09:04:35.909 --> 09:04:38.112
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN THE

09:04:38.178 --> 09:04:39.947
MENTALITY OR THE IDEOLOGY

09:04:40.014 --> 09:04:40.814
THROUGH WHAT WE CALL

09:04:40.881 --> 09:04:42.983
ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION

09:04:43.050 --> 09:04:45.853
AND OTHER GROUPS HAVE BEEN

09:04:45.919 --> 09:04:47.254
PUSHED TO BELIEVE THAT NO YOUTH

09:04:47.321 --> 09:04:50.591
IS GOING TO COMMIT ANY LEVEL

09:04:50.657 --> 09:04:52.326
CRIME THAT NEED TO BE

09:04:52.393 --> 09:04:53.794
INCARCERATED. PROBATION DOES NOT

09:04:53.861 --> 09:04:55.562
INCARCERATE THE COURT,

09:04:55.629 --> 09:04:58.065
INCARCERATE. BUT IF YOU WANT TO

09:04:58.132 --> 09:04:59.333
GET PROBATION OR IF YOU WANT TO

09:04:59.400 --> 09:05:01.468
LOOK AT PROBATION IN A DIFFERENT

09:05:01.535 --> 09:05:03.103
LIGHT. TEN YEARS AGO, L.A.

09:05:03.170 --> 09:05:05.239
COUNTY USED TO HOUSE 3000 YOUTH

09:05:05.305 --> 09:05:08.275
AT ANY ONE TIME. WE DO NOT. WE

09:05:08.342 --> 09:05:10.477
BARELY GET OVER BETWEEN 500 TO

09:05:10.544 --> 09:05:12.913
600, WHICH IS 707 B OFFENSES,

09:05:12.980 --> 09:05:15.482
HIGH LEVEL RAPE, MURDER, THINGS

09:05:15.549 --> 09:05:17.851
OF THAT SORT. AND WHEN WE TAKE

09:05:17.918 --> 09:05:19.053
THEM IN AGAIN, WE DON'T SUPPRESS

09:05:19.119 --> 09:05:21.288
THEM. I LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY.

09:05:21.355 --> 09:05:22.656
MOST OF THE PROBATION OFFICERS

09:05:22.723 --> 09:05:23.824
LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY. WE TRY TO

09:05:23.891 --> 09:05:25.592
GIVE THEM THE LEVEL OF SERVICES

09:05:25.659 --> 09:05:27.327
THEY NEED SO THAT WHEN THEY GO

09:05:27.394 --> 09:05:29.129
BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY, THE

09:05:29.196 --> 09:05:31.265
VICTIMS FEEL COMFORTABLE, THE

09:05:31.331 --> 09:05:32.800
COMMUNITY FEEL COMFORTABLE, AND

09:05:32.866 --> 09:05:34.034
THE PROBATION OFFICER FEEL

09:05:34.101 --> 09:05:35.202
COMFORTABLE THAT THEY DID

09:05:35.269 --> 09:05:36.603
APPROPRIATE JOB. SO WE DON'T

09:05:36.670 --> 09:05:38.105
UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WANT TO

09:05:38.172 --> 09:05:39.740
INCORPORATE AND USE AN ENTITY

09:05:39.807 --> 09:05:41.675
THAT'S ONLY BEEN IN EXISTENCE

09:05:41.742 --> 09:05:44.611
LESS THAN THREE YEARS. IT HAS NO

09:05:44.678 --> 09:05:46.346
EVIDENCE BASED ANALYSIS AT THIS

09:05:46.413 --> 09:05:48.916
POINT. IT TALKS ABOUT 95%

09:05:48.982 --> 09:05:51.618
SUCCESS RATIO. THOSE ARE NOT

09:05:51.685 --> 09:05:54.188
INCARCERATED 707 B OFFENDERS.

09:05:54.254 --> 09:05:56.824
AND SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND CAN I?

09:05:56.890 --> 09:05:58.992
I'M GOING TO GO TO YOU IN A

09:05:59.059 --> 09:06:00.527
MINUTE. BUT REAL QUICK. THREE

09:06:00.594 --> 09:06:01.929
YEARS THIS THIS BUSINESS HAS

09:06:01.995 --> 09:06:04.565
BEEN AROUND. THEY CAME IN AND I

09:06:04.631 --> 09:06:07.267
THINK SEPTEMBER OF 2022 AND THEY

09:06:07.334 --> 09:06:10.104
JUST FINALLY GOT A DIRECTOR THAT

09:06:10.170 --> 09:06:11.438
MAYBE I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE

09:06:11.505 --> 09:06:13.006
PERMANENT YET OR INTERIM

09:06:13.073 --> 09:06:14.408
PERMANENT AND PERMANENT. THEY'RE

09:06:14.475 --> 09:06:16.577
FINALLY PERMANENT. AND THEY WANT

09:06:16.643 --> 09:06:19.379
TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT THAT

09:06:19.446 --> 09:06:20.080
PERSON HAS THE ABILITY TO RUN

09:06:20.147 --> 09:06:22.082
THE LARGEST PROBATION DEPARTMENT

09:06:22.149 --> 09:06:24.251
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO.

09:06:24.318 --> 09:06:25.319
SO IF THEY'D ONLY BEEN DOING

09:06:25.385 --> 09:06:26.787
THIS THREE YEARS, WHO'S WHO WAS

09:06:26.854 --> 09:06:30.023
DOING IT BEFORE THAT? WHO WAS

09:06:30.090 --> 09:06:31.592
I'M SORRY, WHO WAS THE COMPANY

09:06:31.658 --> 09:06:35.095
BEFORE THIS THAT TOOK CARE OF OR

09:06:35.162 --> 09:06:35.829
THIS DEPARTMENT THAT TOOK CARE

09:06:35.896 --> 09:06:38.232
OF THIS OR DID IT JUST. IS THAT

09:06:38.298 --> 09:06:40.367
TÚI? YEAH. WE JUST I'M SORRY. WE

09:06:40.434 --> 09:06:41.535
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE WAS NO

09:06:41.602 --> 09:06:42.936
DIED. THERE IS NO DIED. THERE

09:06:43.003 --> 09:06:44.638
WAS NO DIED. WE JUST CONTRACT

09:06:44.705 --> 09:06:47.207
WITH CBOS. IF THE IF THE

09:06:47.274 --> 09:06:48.008
PROBATION DEPARTMENT THOUGHT

09:06:48.075 --> 09:06:49.610
THEY HAD A PRODUCT THAT WAS

09:06:49.676 --> 09:06:51.111
WORTHY TO MEET THE COURT'S

09:06:51.178 --> 09:06:52.479
MANDATE AND REQUIREMENTS, WE

09:06:52.546 --> 09:06:53.981
WOULD CONTRACT WITH THOSE CBOS.

09:06:54.047 --> 09:06:55.382
WE STILL CONTRACT WITH THOSE

09:06:55.449 --> 09:06:57.618
CBOS. BUT NOW THE COUNTY, WHICH

09:06:57.684 --> 09:06:59.453
BOTH ENTITIES ARE UNDER THE

09:06:59.520 --> 09:07:01.155
COUNTY, THE COUNTY HAS DIRECTED

09:07:01.221 --> 09:07:03.023
PROBATION TO INTERACT WITH DIED.

09:07:03.090 --> 09:07:05.125
AND WE DO INTERACT WITH DIED. WE

09:07:05.192 --> 09:07:06.326
ALLOW THEM TO BRING IN. THEY

09:07:06.393 --> 09:07:08.462
DON'T HAVE PERMANENT STAFF.

09:07:08.529 --> 09:07:09.930
THAT'S A RANK AND FILE. I DON'T

09:07:09.997 --> 09:07:11.598
BELIEVE THEY HAVE A LOT OF

09:07:11.665 --> 09:07:13.167
MANAGEMENT STAFF. THEY CONTRACT

09:07:13.233 --> 09:07:14.935
OUT WITH CBOS AND THEN ASK THOSE

09:07:15.002 --> 09:07:16.737
CBOS TO COME OVER AS IF THEY

09:07:16.803 --> 09:07:18.205
WORK FOR DIED. AND THOSE CBOS

09:07:18.272 --> 09:07:19.306
AREN'T ALLOWED TO COME INTO

09:07:19.373 --> 09:07:20.474
CERTAIN FACILITIES OR PORTIONS

09:07:20.541 --> 09:07:22.142
OF THE FACILITIES BECAUSE THEY

09:07:22.209 --> 09:07:23.510
HAVE FELONS. I'M SORRY. THEY

09:07:23.577 --> 09:07:24.811
HAVE FELONS THAT ARE THEY HAVE

09:07:24.878 --> 09:07:26.079
PEOPLE WHO HAVE FELONIES. THEY

09:07:26.146 --> 09:07:28.215
HAVE WHAT THEY CALL A CREDIBLE

09:07:28.282 --> 09:07:29.049
MESSENGER. CREDIBLE MESSENGER.

09:07:29.116 --> 09:07:30.017
CREDIBLE MESSENGER IS ONE WHO

09:07:30.083 --> 09:07:31.885
HAS BEEN INCARCERATED AND NOW IS

09:07:31.952 --> 09:07:33.654
OUT, AND THEY CAN DELIVER THE

09:07:33.720 --> 09:07:35.556
MESSAGE OF WHY THEY SHOULD NOT

09:07:35.622 --> 09:07:36.823
BE INCARCERATED. AND THAT'S A

09:07:36.890 --> 09:07:38.292
GREAT THING. BUT SOMETIME IF

09:07:38.358 --> 09:07:40.060
YOU'RE LOOKING AT INDIVIDUALS,

09:07:40.127 --> 09:07:41.361
THEY HAVE BEEN STOPPED BY THE

09:07:41.428 --> 09:07:44.064
PROBATION DEPARTMENT BECAUSE OF

09:07:44.131 --> 09:07:45.732
CERTAIN LEVEL OF HISTORY AT THAT

09:07:45.799 --> 09:07:47.034
POINT. AND WHEN THEY GET

09:07:47.100 --> 09:07:48.869
CLEARED, THEY'RE ALLOWED TO COME

09:07:48.936 --> 09:07:49.403
IN ALSO. I'M NOT THAT'S A

09:07:49.469 --> 09:07:51.004
MANAGEMENT ISSUE, OKAY. AND NOT

09:07:51.071 --> 09:07:52.873
A RANK THAT MAKES SENSE. MISS

09:07:52.940 --> 09:07:54.274
SANCHEZ. AND THEN I KNOW,

09:07:54.341 --> 09:07:55.042
SENATOR, YOU WANT TO REPLY.

09:07:55.108 --> 09:07:56.977
YEAH. JUST THROUGH THE CHAIR, IF

09:07:57.044 --> 09:07:57.844
I MAY, JUST TO SPEAK TO YOUR

09:07:57.911 --> 09:08:00.314
QUESTION ABOUT THE PEACE OFFICER

09:08:00.380 --> 09:08:01.682
ISSUE, YOU KNOW, THE BILL

09:08:01.748 --> 09:08:03.250
REFERENCES THAT PEACE OFFICER

09:08:03.317 --> 09:08:05.118
DUTIES PURSUANT TO PC 830 CANNOT

09:08:05.185 --> 09:08:07.521
BE TRANSFERRED. AS YOU KNOW, PC

09:08:07.588 --> 09:08:09.623
830 KIND OF IS THE SECTION THAT

09:08:09.690 --> 09:08:11.558
DEFINES A NUMBER OF PEACE

09:08:11.625 --> 09:08:13.227
OFFICERS. BUT PROBATION OFFICERS

09:08:13.293 --> 09:08:14.661
ARE CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICERS,

09:08:14.728 --> 09:08:16.563
AND PROBATION DEPARTMENTS ARE

09:08:16.630 --> 09:08:17.497
REFERENCED THROUGHOUT THE

09:08:17.564 --> 09:08:18.966
ENTIRETY OF THE WELFARE AND

09:08:19.032 --> 09:08:20.300
INSTITUTIONS CODE FOR THE DUTIES

09:08:20.367 --> 09:08:22.736
THAT WE DO, BOTH IN RELATION TO,

09:08:22.803 --> 09:08:24.271
YOU KNOW, THINGS ON THE FRONT

09:08:24.338 --> 09:08:26.907
END. PREVENTION, DIVERSION, BUT

09:08:26.974 --> 09:08:29.176
ALSO IN RELATION TO OUR ORDERS

09:08:29.243 --> 09:08:30.677
WITH THE COURT AND SUPERVISION

09:08:30.744 --> 09:08:31.845
AND JUVENILE FACILITIES. SO YOU

09:08:31.912 --> 09:08:33.680
CAN'T REALLY KIND OF PARSE OUT

09:08:33.747 --> 09:08:35.249
WHAT IS A PEACE OFFICER NON

09:08:35.315 --> 09:08:37.251
PEACE OFFICER DUTY, BECAUSE THE

09:08:37.317 --> 09:08:39.186
MISSION OF PROBATION AND

09:08:39.253 --> 09:08:40.520
PROBATION AS A CALIFORNIA PEACE

09:08:40.587 --> 09:08:41.922
OFFICER GO HAND IN HAND. AND SO

09:08:41.989 --> 09:08:44.358
I THINK THAT AMENDMENT FROM

09:08:44.424 --> 09:08:46.360
CPUC'S PERSPECTIVE DOESN'T,

09:08:46.426 --> 09:08:47.427
DOESN'T HAVE THE OUTCOME

09:08:47.494 --> 09:08:48.795
INTENDED TO SAY THAT DUTIES

09:08:48.862 --> 09:08:50.631
CAN'T MOVE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T

09:08:50.697 --> 09:08:51.598
KIND OF THERE'S THAT INTERPLAY

09:08:51.665 --> 09:08:53.267
THAT YOU CAN'T DELINK. THE ONE

09:08:53.333 --> 09:08:55.602
OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT

09:08:55.669 --> 09:08:56.837
THE, YOU KNOW, AS IT WAS SHARED

09:08:56.903 --> 09:08:58.105
THAT THAT THIS IS INTENDED TO

09:08:58.171 --> 09:09:00.574
KIND OF BE BE SUPPLEMENTAL TO

09:09:00.641 --> 09:09:01.475
PROBATION, YOU KNOW, COUNTIES

09:09:01.541 --> 09:09:03.076
THROUGHOUT THE STATE DO THIS NOW

09:09:03.143 --> 09:09:05.045
THEY WORK ACROSS MULTI

09:09:05.112 --> 09:09:05.812
DISCIPLINES WITH COUNTY

09:09:05.879 --> 09:09:07.481
PARTNERS, AGAIN WITH

09:09:07.547 --> 09:09:09.516
NON-GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES TO

09:09:09.583 --> 09:09:10.851
BRING SERVICES TO BEAR IN

09:09:10.917 --> 09:09:12.619
COORDINATION. AND SO, YOU KNOW,

09:09:12.686 --> 09:09:14.788
THIS BILL IS NOT NEEDED TO

09:09:14.855 --> 09:09:15.922
EFFECTUATE THAT. WHAT THE BILL

09:09:15.989 --> 09:09:17.090
WOULD DO IS CHANGE THE

09:09:17.157 --> 09:09:19.660
GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION ON

09:09:19.726 --> 09:09:23.263
PROBATION DUTIES TO TRANSFER TO

09:09:23.330 --> 09:09:24.765
A DIFFERENT ENTITY. SO THERE IS

09:09:24.831 --> 09:09:27.000
ANOTHER PATH. YES. THESE YOU

09:09:27.067 --> 09:09:29.469
KNOW, CROSS CROSS COLLABORATION

09:09:29.536 --> 09:09:30.704
IS HAPPENING AGAIN ACROSS THE

09:09:30.771 --> 09:09:32.205
STATE NOW. AND I THINK, YOU

09:09:32.272 --> 09:09:34.841
KNOW, THE GOAL OF COORDINATING

09:09:34.908 --> 09:09:36.710
SERVICES AND WORKING TOGETHER,

09:09:36.777 --> 09:09:38.445
THAT CAN AND DOES HAPPEN WITHOUT

09:09:38.512 --> 09:09:39.980
THIS BILL. THIS BILL TAKES THE

09:09:40.047 --> 09:09:41.081
STEP OF CHANGING THE GOVERNMENT

09:09:41.148 --> 09:09:43.917
CODE SECTION AROUND THESE REALLY

09:09:43.984 --> 09:09:44.951
IMPORTANT PUBLIC SAFETY AND

09:09:45.018 --> 09:09:46.253
JUVENILE JUSTICE DUTIES AND

09:09:46.320 --> 09:09:48.689
TAKING PROBATION OUT OF THOSE

09:09:48.755 --> 09:09:49.790
SERVICES. THANK YOU. SENATOR.

09:09:49.856 --> 09:09:52.893
SENATOR, I WANT TO MAKE SURE

09:09:52.959 --> 09:09:54.294
WE'RE REALLY DRAWING THIS

09:09:54.361 --> 09:09:56.863
DISTINCTION, THAT PEACE OFFICER

09:09:56.930 --> 09:09:58.632
DUTIES AND ROLES ARE NEEDED AND

09:09:58.699 --> 09:10:00.200
WILL BE MAINTAINED IN JUVENILE

09:10:00.267 --> 09:10:02.636
HALLS. YOU HAVE TO HAVE THEM. MY

09:10:02.703 --> 09:10:04.371
BILL DOESN'T TALK ABOUT THE

09:10:04.438 --> 09:10:05.939
ROLES THAT ARE PEACE OFFICERS

09:10:06.006 --> 09:10:08.442
REQUIRED TO DO THE SAFETY, THE

09:10:08.508 --> 09:10:11.311
TRANSFER, THE CONTROL OF THE

09:10:11.378 --> 09:10:12.779
JUVENILE HALL OR THE RANCH.

09:10:12.846 --> 09:10:14.481
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SERVICES

09:10:14.548 --> 09:10:16.817
ONLY, ONLY THE SERVICES THAT ARE

09:10:16.883 --> 09:10:18.919
NOT HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN OUR

09:10:18.985 --> 09:10:20.020
JUVENILE HALLS. IN MY

09:10:20.087 --> 09:10:21.488
INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS THAT I

09:10:21.555 --> 09:10:22.823
RAN, WE BROUGHT OTHER

09:10:22.889 --> 09:10:23.857
REPRESENTATIVES FROM OTHER

09:10:23.924 --> 09:10:26.860
COUNTY WHO ARE IMMACULATE. AND

09:10:26.927 --> 09:10:28.595
WHAT THE OPPOSITION JUST SHARED

09:10:28.662 --> 09:10:30.797
IS HAPPENING IN OTHER COUNTIES.

09:10:30.864 --> 09:10:32.532
IT'S JUST NOT HAPPENING IN L.A.

09:10:32.599 --> 09:10:35.402
COUNTY. AFTER TWO YEARS WORTH OF

09:10:35.469 --> 09:10:37.971
DIGGING INTO THIS THIS TOPIC, WE

09:10:38.038 --> 09:10:39.706
LEARNED THAT OTHER PROBATION

09:10:39.773 --> 09:10:42.209
DEPARTMENTS ARE MORE OPEN DOOR

09:10:42.275 --> 09:10:44.411
POLICY TO COLLABORATE WITH OTHER

09:10:44.478 --> 09:10:46.413
CBOS. IF WE HAD THAT IN L.A.

09:10:46.480 --> 09:10:48.248
COUNTY, THIS BILL WOULD NOT BE

09:10:48.315 --> 09:10:49.483
IN EXISTENCE. WE WOULDN'T NEED

09:10:49.549 --> 09:10:50.851
TO RUN THIS BILL BECAUSE THERE

09:10:50.917 --> 09:10:52.452
WOULD BE A REALLY CLOSE

09:10:52.519 --> 09:10:54.121
COLLABORATION WITH PROBATION AND

09:10:54.187 --> 09:10:56.089
CBOS AS IT EXISTS RIGHT NOW, BUT

09:10:56.156 --> 09:10:57.758
THAT'S JUST NOT HAPPENING. SO IN

09:10:57.824 --> 09:10:59.626
ORDER FOR US TO PROVIDE THE

09:10:59.693 --> 09:11:01.061
SERVICES AND THIS BILL DOESN'T

09:11:01.128 --> 09:11:02.763
TALK ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF YEARS

09:11:02.829 --> 09:11:05.031
JUVENILE SPENDS AND WHAT CRIME

09:11:05.098 --> 09:11:06.733
THEY COMMITTED, THAT HAS NOTHING

09:11:06.800 --> 09:11:09.036
TO DO WITH THIS BILL, BECAUSE

09:11:09.102 --> 09:11:09.970
REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU

09:11:10.036 --> 09:11:12.239
COMMITTED, YOU STILL ARE OWED

09:11:12.305 --> 09:11:13.707
REHABILITATIVE SERVICES, JUST

09:11:13.774 --> 09:11:15.642
LIKE IN CDCR. AND WE TALK ABOUT

09:11:15.709 --> 09:11:17.544
OUR PRINCIPLES. CALIFORNIA IS

09:11:17.611 --> 09:11:19.379
GOING THROUGH TOWARDS A

09:11:19.446 --> 09:11:21.515
CALIFORNIA MODEL BASED OFF OF

09:11:21.581 --> 09:11:23.717
NORWAY MODEL THAT WE JUST VOTED

09:11:23.784 --> 09:11:25.886
ON INVESTMENT IN DOLLARS FOR

09:11:25.952 --> 09:11:27.888
CDCR SAN QUENTIN. AND IF WE WANT

09:11:27.954 --> 09:11:29.256
TO TALK ABOUT OUR PRINCIPLES AND

09:11:29.322 --> 09:11:30.891
WHERE CALIFORNIA IS GOING, THIS

09:11:30.957 --> 09:11:32.058
BODY JUST VOTED IN THIS BUDGET

09:11:32.125 --> 09:11:36.797
THIS YEAR, A NEW ABILITY TO

09:11:36.863 --> 09:11:38.031
ALLOW COUNTIES TO WITHHOLD

09:11:38.098 --> 09:11:40.233
FUNDING FROM HALLS THAT ARE NOT

09:11:40.300 --> 09:11:42.769
IN COMPLIANT RIGHT NOW. SO IF

09:11:42.836 --> 09:11:44.371
PROBATION DOES NOT GET ANY HELP

09:11:44.438 --> 09:11:45.906
RIGHT NOW, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

09:11:45.972 --> 09:11:47.707
GET ANY FUNDING BECAUSE WE JUST

09:11:47.774 --> 09:11:49.142
PASSED THAT IN THE BUDGET LESS

09:11:49.209 --> 09:11:50.877
THAN THREE WEEKS AGO. SO THIS IS

09:11:50.944 --> 09:11:52.179
GOING TO HELP THEM. AND I JUST

09:11:52.245 --> 09:11:53.747
WANT TO READ SOMETHING,

09:11:53.814 --> 09:11:55.348
ASSEMBLYMEMBER, THAT THEY TALK

09:11:55.415 --> 09:11:56.616
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THIS

09:11:56.683 --> 09:11:57.851
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COURTS.

09:11:57.918 --> 09:11:59.085
PERMISSION TO READ GRANTED. FOR

09:11:59.152 --> 09:12:00.887
THE RECORD, IT'S ALL GOOD. I FOR

09:12:00.954 --> 09:12:03.089
THE FLOOR. I THOUGHT THAT WAS

09:12:03.156 --> 09:12:04.991
ONLY FOR THE FLOOR. I APOLOGIZE.

09:12:05.058 --> 09:12:06.526
WE'RE VERY FORMAL HERE WITH THE

09:12:06.593 --> 09:12:08.695
COURTS. THIS JUST HAPPENED MAY

09:12:08.762 --> 09:12:11.064
9TH BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO GO TO

09:12:11.131 --> 09:12:13.366
COURT AND SO FORTH. THEY

09:12:13.433 --> 09:12:14.201
REQUESTED THIS. THIS HAPPENS ALL

09:12:14.267 --> 09:12:16.169
THE TIME. REASON FOR CONTINUANCE

09:12:16.236 --> 09:12:18.038
AT THE PROBATION. ASKED FOR

09:12:18.104 --> 09:12:19.806
REASON FOR CONTINUANCE. AT THIS

09:12:19.873 --> 09:12:21.641
TIME, PROBATION DOES NOT HAVE

09:12:21.708 --> 09:12:22.709
ADEQUATE STAFFING IN THE FIELD

09:12:22.776 --> 09:12:24.244
TO PREPARE A SUFFICIENT REPORT

09:12:24.311 --> 09:12:26.012
FOR THE COURT'S CONSIDERATION.

09:12:26.079 --> 09:12:27.481
THEREFORE, A CONTINUOUS

09:12:27.547 --> 09:12:29.015
RESPECTFULLY REQUESTED FOR ONE

09:12:29.082 --> 09:12:31.318
MONTH THAT IS HAPPENING OVER AND

09:12:31.384 --> 09:12:33.086
OVER AGAIN BY LÀ PROBATION ON

09:12:33.153 --> 09:12:33.820
THEIR BEHALF, REQUESTING IT

09:12:33.887 --> 09:12:35.021
BECAUSE THEY THEMSELVES KNOW

09:12:35.088 --> 09:12:37.224
THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH STAFF

09:12:37.290 --> 09:12:39.726
BECAUSE OF AB109. THEY JUST

09:12:39.793 --> 09:12:41.094
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH STAFF.

09:12:41.161 --> 09:12:42.195
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. SO REAL QUICK,

09:12:42.262 --> 09:12:43.363
REAL QUICK, THE CBOS THAT YOU'RE

09:12:43.430 --> 09:12:44.798
TALKING ABOUT IN THESE OTHER

09:12:44.865 --> 09:12:46.266
COUNTIES, ARE WE USING THE SAME

09:12:46.333 --> 09:12:48.034
CBOS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY? SOME

09:12:48.101 --> 09:12:49.803
ARE LIKE ARK IS STATEWIDE AND

09:12:49.870 --> 09:12:51.838
THAT'S USED ACROSS THE STATE.

09:12:51.905 --> 09:12:53.707
YES, BUT I CAN'T PINPOINT A

09:12:53.773 --> 09:12:55.141
WHOLE LIST OF OTHER CBOS. SOME

09:12:55.208 --> 09:12:57.377
ARE MORE LOCAL TO LA. OKAY,

09:12:57.444 --> 09:12:59.079
WELL, I JUST I JUST SEEM IF

09:12:59.145 --> 09:13:00.647
THOSE OTHER COUNTIES IN YOUR

09:13:00.714 --> 09:13:01.414
INFORMATIONAL HEARING ARE

09:13:01.481 --> 09:13:03.216
WORKING, I DON'T KNOW WHY WE

09:13:03.283 --> 09:13:03.850
WOULDN'T LOOK INTO THOSE CBOS

09:13:03.917 --> 09:13:05.685
AND HAVE THEM COME TO LA COUNTY

09:13:05.752 --> 09:13:08.021
IF OBVIOUSLY THOSE CHIEF

09:13:08.088 --> 09:13:10.557
PROBATION OFFICERS ARE OKAY WITH

09:13:10.624 --> 09:13:12.559
IT. SOME ARE LOCAL ASSEMBLY

09:13:12.626 --> 09:13:14.127
MEMBER THAT WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO.

09:13:14.194 --> 09:13:17.497
BUT LIKE ARK IS STATEWIDE. OKAY.

09:13:17.564 --> 09:13:19.533
WELL AGAIN, LOS ANGELES HAS A

09:13:19.599 --> 09:13:21.167
LOT OF ISSUES. I CAN GET THAT.

09:13:21.234 --> 09:13:23.570
THERE WAS A POINT THAT YOU DID

09:13:23.637 --> 09:13:25.238
MAKE. I WILL JUST NOTE WE HAVE A

09:13:25.305 --> 09:13:26.473
LOS ANGELES LEGISLATOR HERE AND

09:13:26.540 --> 09:13:28.408
AT LEAST A COUPLE ON THE DAIS.

09:13:28.475 --> 09:13:30.277
YEAH, YEAH, A FEW OF THEM. YOU

09:13:30.343 --> 09:13:31.845
GUYS NEED TO HAVE A TALK WITH

09:13:31.912 --> 09:13:33.313
THOSE LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS TO

09:13:33.380 --> 09:13:36.516
MAKE SURE THEY DO THEIR JOBS.

09:13:36.583 --> 09:13:38.318
YOU MADE A POINT ABOUT PROBATION

09:13:38.385 --> 09:13:39.286
OFFICERS BEING PULLED OFF THE

09:13:39.352 --> 09:13:40.587
STREETS AND BEING BROUGHT INTO

09:13:40.654 --> 09:13:43.723
THE HALL. YOU KNOW, I, I SEE

09:13:43.790 --> 09:13:45.926
THAT ISSUE, ACTUALLY, I TRIED

09:13:45.992 --> 09:13:47.360
FIXING THAT ISSUE WITH, WITH

09:13:47.427 --> 09:13:48.728
JURY DUTY, TRYING TO KEEP THEM

09:13:48.795 --> 09:13:51.031
OUT ON THE STREETS AS WELL. BUT

09:13:51.097 --> 09:13:52.332
WE'RE WORKING ON THAT SIDE NOTE,

09:13:52.399 --> 09:13:54.935
I SO I SEE THE VALUE. I SEE THE

09:13:55.001 --> 09:13:56.036
VALUE IN REHABILITATION. WE TALK

09:13:56.102 --> 09:13:57.771
ABOUT IT HERE ALL THE TIME HERE

09:13:57.837 --> 09:13:59.606
IN COMMITTEE. BUT BUT TO YOUR

09:13:59.673 --> 09:14:01.241
POINT ALSO ABOUT BRINGING THOSE

09:14:01.308 --> 09:14:01.808
THAT HAVE BEEN INCARCERATED,

09:14:01.875 --> 09:14:03.610
I'VE ALSO SEEN IN THIS COMMITTEE

09:14:03.677 --> 09:14:05.779
WHERE WE CUT SENTENCES SHORT, WE

09:14:05.845 --> 09:14:06.379
DON'T GIVE THEM THE TIME TO

09:14:06.446 --> 09:14:07.080
REHABILITATE. AND SO THEN BY

09:14:07.147 --> 09:14:08.348
THEN WE'RE CREATING OUR OWN

09:14:08.415 --> 09:14:10.951
STORM, OUR OWN ISSUE BY NOW,

09:14:11.017 --> 09:14:11.585
ALLOWING THEM TO GO INTO THESE

09:14:11.651 --> 09:14:12.953
FACILITIES, THEY CAN GET

09:14:13.019 --> 09:14:14.721
EXPUNGED AFTER SO MANY YEARS. OR

09:14:14.788 --> 09:14:15.622
AGAIN, THEY DON'T FINISH THEIR

09:14:15.689 --> 09:14:17.157
TIME. THEY DON'T FINISH THEIR

09:14:17.223 --> 09:14:18.058
THEIR CLASSES. BUT YET WE'RE

09:14:18.124 --> 09:14:19.192
GOING TO GIVE THEM A PASS. AND

09:14:19.259 --> 09:14:21.027
BY THAT PASS NOW WE'RE GOING TO

09:14:21.094 --> 09:14:23.663
ALLOW THEM TO COME IN HERE WITH

09:14:23.730 --> 09:14:25.298
OUR CHILDREN THAT ARE TRYING TO

09:14:25.365 --> 09:14:26.566
GET REHABILITATED IN THE

09:14:26.633 --> 09:14:27.167
JUVENILE HALLS, THAT PROBATION

09:14:27.233 --> 09:14:28.301
IS IN CHARGE OF OR CHARGED WITH

09:14:28.368 --> 09:14:29.836
MAKING SURE THEY TAKE CARE OF

09:14:29.903 --> 09:14:33.173
THAT. AND SO I JUST I JUST SEE,

09:14:33.239 --> 09:14:34.040
I DO SEE THE ISSUES THAT WERE

09:14:34.107 --> 09:14:35.475
BROUGHT UP BY MY, MY COLLEAGUES

09:14:35.542 --> 09:14:38.778
UP HERE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF

09:14:38.845 --> 09:14:39.813
DISCUSSIONS. I THINK EVERYBODY

09:14:39.879 --> 09:14:42.882
HERE IN OPPOSITION BEING A BIG

09:14:42.949 --> 09:14:44.551
PART OF THAT. THE POINTS THAT

09:14:44.618 --> 09:14:45.885
WERE MADE TODAY, I, I

09:14:45.952 --> 09:14:47.854
WHOLEHEARTEDLY BELIEVE THAT

09:14:47.921 --> 09:14:48.989
PROBATION IS DOING THEIR BEST.

09:14:49.055 --> 09:14:50.156
ALL THE PROBATION OFFICERS THAT

09:14:50.223 --> 09:14:52.926
I KNOW, THEY'RE NOT IN IT FOR

09:14:52.993 --> 09:14:54.427
THE MONEY. THEY UNDERSTAND THEY

09:14:54.494 --> 09:14:55.729
NEED A DEGREE TO GET WHERE THEY

09:14:55.795 --> 09:14:57.564
ARE, BECAUSE THEY LOVE TAKING

09:14:57.631 --> 09:14:59.032
CARE OF PEOPLE AND HELPING

09:14:59.099 --> 09:14:59.966
PEOPLE. I DON'T KNOW SO MUCH

09:15:00.033 --> 09:15:01.101
ABOUT THESE THESE OTHER

09:15:01.167 --> 09:15:03.003
ENTITIES, BUT WHEN A PROBATION

09:15:03.069 --> 09:15:04.638
OFFICER IS GIVEN THAT BADGE OR

09:15:04.704 --> 09:15:06.106
EARNED THAT BADGE AND TAKES THAT

09:15:06.172 --> 09:15:07.674
OATH, I BELIEVE THEY'RE GOING TO

09:15:07.741 --> 09:15:10.543
DO WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO. I

09:15:10.610 --> 09:15:13.013
HAVE ONE OTHER THING. I KNOW THE

09:15:13.079 --> 09:15:14.381
CHAIR HAD MENTIONED THAT WE'RE

09:15:14.447 --> 09:15:16.583
GOING TO BE HOLDING THIS IN

09:15:16.650 --> 09:15:18.752
COMMITTEE OR HOLDING THIS NÓ.

09:15:18.818 --> 09:15:20.120
THE AGREEMENT THAT WAS JUST

09:15:20.186 --> 09:15:21.521
STATED ON THE RECORD EARLIER IS

09:15:21.588 --> 09:15:23.590
THAT SHOULD THE BILL PASS OUT OF

09:15:23.657 --> 09:15:24.557
COMMITTEE, SENATOR MENGIBAR HAS

09:15:24.624 --> 09:15:26.359
AGREED TO HOLD IT AND NOT

09:15:26.426 --> 09:15:27.661
PROCEED WITH THE FLOOR VOTE.

09:15:27.727 --> 09:15:30.296
THIS CALENDAR YEAR? IS THERE, IS

09:15:30.363 --> 09:15:32.098
THERE? SO I'M ASSUMING THERE'S

09:15:32.165 --> 09:15:35.301
NOT AN URGENCY ON THIS THEN? NO,

09:15:35.368 --> 09:15:38.271
THERE'S NO URGENCY PROVISION.

09:15:38.338 --> 09:15:39.773
SENATOR, IT'S YOUR BILL. YOU GO

09:15:39.839 --> 09:15:41.341
RIGHT AHEAD. THERE IS DEFINITELY

09:15:41.408 --> 09:15:42.609
AN URGENCY IN L.A. COUNTY, BUT

09:15:42.676 --> 09:15:44.144
THIS WAS THE ONLY WAY THAT I

09:15:44.210 --> 09:15:46.179
COULD GET IT OUT OF POLICY

09:15:46.246 --> 09:15:47.681
COMMITTEE. SO I THAT WAS THE

09:15:47.747 --> 09:15:49.015
ONLY WAY I COULD GET IT TO THE

09:15:49.082 --> 09:15:50.817
FLOOR. BUT FROM WHAT I

09:15:50.884 --> 09:15:52.218
UNDERSTAND, WHEN IT GETS TO THE

09:15:52.285 --> 09:15:53.953
FLOOR, WE DON'T HAVE ANY MORE

09:15:54.020 --> 09:15:54.954
ARGUMENTS TO MAKE UNLESS IT'S

09:15:55.021 --> 09:15:56.623
AMONGST OURSELVES ON THE FLOOR.

09:15:56.690 --> 09:15:57.891
IS THERE IS THERE MAYBE AN

09:15:57.957 --> 09:15:59.159
AVENUE WHERE WE CAN BRING IT

09:15:59.225 --> 09:16:01.327
BACK HERE AND MAYBE WORK WITH

09:16:01.394 --> 09:16:02.128
OPPOSITION? IT WOULD BE UP TO

09:16:02.195 --> 09:16:04.564
THE CHAIR TO DO THAT. OKAY. BUT

09:16:04.631 --> 09:16:06.066
I'M HOPING THAT THE DEAL THAT

09:16:06.132 --> 09:16:08.134
WAS CUT IS THE DEAL ON THE TABLE

09:16:08.201 --> 09:16:09.135
RIGHT NOW. AND I WOULD JUST

09:16:09.202 --> 09:16:11.604
NOTE, MR. VICE CHAIR, AS YOU'RE

09:16:11.671 --> 09:16:12.706
PROBABLY WELL AWARE, IF THERE

09:16:12.772 --> 09:16:13.339
WERE SIGNIFICANT AND SUBSTANTIAL

09:16:13.406 --> 09:16:14.174
POLICY CHANGES, THE COMMITTEE

09:16:14.240 --> 09:16:16.176
WOULD HAVE THE PURVIEW TO BRING

09:16:16.242 --> 09:16:17.811
THAT BACK IN. IF THERE WERE

09:16:17.877 --> 09:16:19.813
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES. AND I DO

09:16:19.879 --> 09:16:21.448
TRUST OUR COMMITTEE AND THE

09:16:21.514 --> 09:16:24.951
CHAIR. YES. THANK THE OPPOSITION

09:16:25.018 --> 09:16:26.252
FOR COMING IN. AND THANK YOU,

09:16:26.319 --> 09:16:28.521
SENATOR. VERY GOOD.

09:16:28.588 --> 09:16:29.456
ASSEMBLYMEMBER NGUYEN, YOU HAVE

09:16:29.522 --> 09:16:30.857
BEEN PATIENT. I JUST HAVE A

09:16:30.924 --> 09:16:32.926
QUICK QUESTION OR A COMMENT AND

09:16:32.992 --> 09:16:34.794
EITHER SIDE CAN ANSWER THE

09:16:34.861 --> 09:16:35.495
QUESTION, BUT I HEARD A LOT

09:16:35.562 --> 09:16:37.063
ABOUT NOT ENOUGH STAFFING. I

09:16:37.130 --> 09:16:39.432
HEARD A LOT ABOUT HAVING

09:16:39.499 --> 09:16:40.767
INCENTIVES, BUT NOT GETTING

09:16:40.834 --> 09:16:42.736
FOLKS TO BE ABLE TO APPLY. I'M

09:16:42.802 --> 09:16:44.571
WONDERING THOUGH, THE WHOLE NOT

09:16:44.637 --> 09:16:46.306
ENOUGH STAFFING TO DO WORK HAS

09:16:46.372 --> 09:16:48.041
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE. I READ

09:16:48.108 --> 09:16:49.876
IT SOMEWHERE THAT LA COUNTY PUT

09:16:49.943 --> 09:16:51.478
A FREEZE ON HIRING OF PROBATION

09:16:51.544 --> 09:16:52.812
OFFICERS FOR TEN YEARS. ARE WE

09:16:52.879 --> 09:16:54.881
JUST NOW PLAYING CATCH UP? AND

09:16:54.948 --> 09:16:56.750
THAT'S WHY WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

09:16:56.816 --> 09:16:57.784
STAFFING FOR THIS. AND EITHER

09:16:57.851 --> 09:16:59.085
SIDE CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

09:16:59.152 --> 09:17:00.553
I'LL SPEAK TO IT. SINCE I'VE

09:17:00.620 --> 09:17:02.055
BEEN IN THE DEPARTMENT FOR 33

09:17:02.122 --> 09:17:05.725
YEARS. FOR YEARS THERE WAS A

09:17:05.792 --> 09:17:07.193
HIRING FREEZE ALLOCATED BY THE

09:17:07.260 --> 09:17:09.529
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS, AND IF YOU

09:17:09.596 --> 09:17:12.265
GO BACK TO I WANT TO CARRY YOU

09:17:12.332 --> 09:17:14.467
TOO FAR BACK, BUT IF YOU GO BACK

09:17:14.534 --> 09:17:16.503
TO 2011, LOS ANGELES COUNTY USED

09:17:16.569 --> 09:17:19.439
TO HAVE 19 CAMPS. WE'RE DOWN TO

09:17:19.506 --> 09:17:21.574
FOUR CAMPS NOW. AND WHEN THEY

09:17:21.641 --> 09:17:24.677
DID THAT, THEY DECIDED TO NOT

09:17:24.744 --> 09:17:26.212
KEEP UP WITH ATTRITION, EVEN

09:17:26.279 --> 09:17:28.314
THOUGH WE KNEW THERE WOULD BE A

09:17:28.381 --> 09:17:30.450
REDUCTION IN INVENTORY OF STAFF.

09:17:30.517 --> 09:17:32.919
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH

09:17:32.986 --> 09:17:35.555
HIRING ALLOWED TO KEEP UP WITH

09:17:35.622 --> 09:17:36.656
ATTRITION. FOR INSTANCE, I, I

09:17:36.723 --> 09:17:38.792
REPRESENT THE RANK AND FILE. 15

09:17:38.858 --> 09:17:40.960
YEARS AGO, THERE WERE 4400

09:17:41.027 --> 09:17:43.530
MEMBERS IN THE RANK AND FILE.

09:17:43.596 --> 09:17:45.598
TODAY IT'S LESS THAN 2100

09:17:45.665 --> 09:17:47.433
MEMBERS. AND SOMETIME WHEN YOU

09:17:47.500 --> 09:17:50.336
HEAR THAT SERVICE IS NOT BEING

09:17:50.403 --> 09:17:51.738
PROVIDED, WE COULD BLAME THOSE

09:17:51.805 --> 09:17:54.774
WHO SYSTEMATICALLY CHANGE THE

09:17:54.841 --> 09:17:56.743
IDEOLOGY AND THE HIRING

09:17:56.810 --> 09:17:58.578
PRACTICES FOR LA COUNTY. AND

09:17:58.645 --> 09:18:00.113
THEN YOU GET TO THE POINT WHERE

09:18:00.180 --> 09:18:02.549
THEY'RE STARTING TO REFORM THEIR

09:18:02.615 --> 09:18:06.386
MENTALITY ABOUT HIRING. YOU HAVE

09:18:06.452 --> 09:18:09.355
PLACED A DISPARAGING VIEW OF

09:18:09.422 --> 09:18:12.292
PROBATION SO BAD THAT ALL LAW

09:18:12.358 --> 09:18:13.393
ENFORCEMENT IN LOS ANGELES

09:18:13.459 --> 09:18:16.496
COUNTY HAS A STAFFING PROBLEM.

09:18:16.563 --> 09:18:18.832
THE SHERIFFS ARE DOWN 1500. WE

09:18:18.898 --> 09:18:20.934
ARE DOWN A THOUSAND OFFICERS.

09:18:21.000 --> 09:18:23.102
LAPD IS OFFERING $75,000

09:18:23.169 --> 09:18:24.904
BONUSES. IT IS A PROBLEM

09:18:24.971 --> 09:18:26.372
THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND

09:18:26.439 --> 09:18:27.774
ESPECIALLY IN LOS ANGELES

09:18:27.841 --> 09:18:29.909
COUNTY. SO SOME THINGS ARE

09:18:29.976 --> 09:18:31.411
EXPERIENCED BY THE SYSTEMATIC

09:18:31.477 --> 09:18:33.913
APPROACH THAT WAS GIVEN TO THE

09:18:33.980 --> 09:18:36.015
DEPARTMENT. AND AGAIN, I'LL SAY

09:18:36.082 --> 09:18:38.218
THE PEACE OFFICERS THEMSELVES,

09:18:38.284 --> 09:18:39.686
THROUGH THEIR COLLECTIVE

09:18:39.752 --> 09:18:40.753
BARGAINING AGREEMENT, THEIR

09:18:40.820 --> 09:18:42.121
UNION THEY REPRESENT, HAS COME

09:18:42.188 --> 09:18:46.025
TO THE STATE TO TRY TO GET THEM

09:18:46.092 --> 09:18:48.494
TO ENCOURAGE LOS ANGELES COUNTY,

09:18:48.561 --> 09:18:51.064
DEAL WITH THE STAFFING SHORTAGE,

09:18:51.130 --> 09:18:53.600
DEAL WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE

09:18:53.666 --> 09:18:55.168
PROBLEM. FOR INSTANCE, WHEN THE

09:18:55.235 --> 09:18:57.704
STATE DECIDED TO TURN OVER

09:18:57.770 --> 09:19:00.206
DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE

09:19:00.273 --> 09:19:03.509
TO THE COUNTIES LA COUNTY IN TWO

09:19:03.576 --> 09:19:05.411
AND A HALF YEARS RECEIVED 88

09:19:05.478 --> 09:19:07.013
MILLION. THERE WAS A STATE AUDIT

09:19:07.080 --> 09:19:08.581
DONE LAST YEAR IN AUGUST, THEY

09:19:08.648 --> 09:19:11.084
ONLY SPENT 9 MILLION SO FAR. SO

09:19:11.150 --> 09:19:13.219
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OTHER 79

09:19:13.286 --> 09:19:14.254
MILLION? ARE YOU WITHHOLDING

09:19:14.320 --> 09:19:16.322
THAT OR ARE YOU ACTUALLY USING

09:19:16.389 --> 09:19:18.091
THAT TO INVEST IN THE

09:19:18.157 --> 09:19:19.993
DEPARTMENT? THEY'RE HOLDING IT

09:19:20.059 --> 09:19:23.630
FOR OTHER FUNDING. SO YES, WE

09:19:23.696 --> 09:19:25.465
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH STAFFING.

09:19:25.531 --> 09:19:27.934
WE'RE TRYING TO CURE THAT. THIS

09:19:28.001 --> 09:19:30.169
RANK AND FILE MET WITH THE CHIEF

09:19:30.236 --> 09:19:31.104
YESTERDAY TO TRY TO CONVINCE HIM

09:19:31.170 --> 09:19:33.172
THAT HE'S STILL BEING

09:19:33.239 --> 09:19:35.475
HANDCUFFED. THERE'S NO REASON

09:19:35.541 --> 09:19:38.011
THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE ACADEMY OF

09:19:38.077 --> 09:19:39.612
EIGHT PEOPLE IN YOUR RECRUITMENT

09:19:39.679 --> 09:19:40.780
WHEN YOU HAVE APPLICATIONS OF

09:19:40.847 --> 09:19:43.716
OVER 500, SO THERE'S SOMETHING

09:19:43.783 --> 09:19:45.685
WRONG WITH THE PROCESS THAT

09:19:45.752 --> 09:19:48.054
COULD ASSIST US IN STARTING THE

09:19:48.121 --> 09:19:51.624
REFORMS THAT WE NEED. MAY I

09:19:51.691 --> 09:19:53.259
RESPOND, ASSEMBLYMEMBER, THROUGH

09:19:53.326 --> 09:19:57.130
THE CHAIR. IT COULD BE A

09:19:57.196 --> 09:19:58.097
COMBINATION OF THAT

09:19:58.164 --> 09:19:59.565
ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S SURE OF A

09:19:59.632 --> 09:20:01.401
FREEZE AND SO FORTH. BUT THE

09:20:01.467 --> 09:20:02.769
PROBLEMS IN L.A. COUNTY

09:20:02.835 --> 09:20:05.305
PROBATION GO AS FAR BACK AS

09:20:05.371 --> 09:20:08.641
2006. THAT IS 19 YEARS. 2006 IS

09:20:08.708 --> 09:20:11.444
WHEN THE DOJ PUT THEM UNDER

09:20:11.511 --> 09:20:13.079
FEDERAL SUPERVISION FOR REPORTS

09:20:13.146 --> 09:20:16.115
OF ABUSE. 2008 L.A. COUNTY WAS

09:20:16.182 --> 09:20:17.483
FOUND VIOLATING CONSTITUTIONAL

09:20:17.550 --> 09:20:19.352
RIGHTS OF JUVENILE DETAINEES,

09:20:19.419 --> 09:20:22.355
2002 LAWSUITS. THEY JUST ARE

09:20:22.422 --> 09:20:25.058
ABOUT TO SETTLE ON A $4 BILLION

09:20:25.124 --> 09:20:27.593
LAWSUIT FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT. I

09:20:27.660 --> 09:20:29.462
GET IT. THERE ARE GOOD APPLES

09:20:29.529 --> 09:20:31.597
EVERYWHERE. I GET IT THAT OTHER

09:20:31.664 --> 09:20:32.532
PROBATION DEPARTMENTS ARE DOING

09:20:32.598 --> 09:20:34.534
WELL, BUT IN IN LA PROBATION

09:20:34.600 --> 09:20:35.635
THERE'S GOING ON EVEN THOUGH

09:20:35.702 --> 09:20:37.804
WITH THE INABILITY TO HIRE, WE

09:20:37.870 --> 09:20:39.906
STILL HAVE A 60% CALL OUT DAY

09:20:39.973 --> 09:20:42.041
CALL OUT ON ANY GIVEN DAY. SO

09:20:42.108 --> 09:20:43.776
EVEN THE PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE

09:20:43.843 --> 09:20:45.178
HIRED NOW, EVEN THOUGH IT'S

09:20:45.244 --> 09:20:47.013
LOWER STAFF, THEY ARE NOT EVEN

09:20:47.080 --> 09:20:48.915
SHOWING UP. SO REGARDLESS, IF WE

09:20:48.982 --> 09:20:50.650
HIRE MORE PEOPLE, THE CALL OUT

09:20:50.717 --> 09:20:53.619
CULTURE IS STILL VERY, VERY REAL

09:20:53.686 --> 09:20:56.756
IN LA COUNTY. SO IN TERMS OF THE

09:20:56.823 --> 09:20:58.925
FUNDING, WE AS THE STATE ARE

09:20:58.992 --> 09:21:00.293
REQUIRED BY LAW TO SEND DOWN

09:21:00.360 --> 09:21:01.961
FUNDING TO EVERY COUNTY AND IT

09:21:02.028 --> 09:21:04.397
IS APPROXIMATELY $88 MILLION.

09:21:04.464 --> 09:21:06.432
BUT THERE IS A COUNCIL, IT'S BY

09:21:06.499 --> 09:21:08.401
LAW THAT EXISTS ON EVERY IN

09:21:08.468 --> 09:21:10.470
EVERY SINGLE COUNTY IS THE JJ

09:21:10.536 --> 09:21:11.904
LEAGUE COUNCIL THAT EXISTS IN

09:21:11.971 --> 09:21:13.473
EVERY COUNTY THAT DETERMINES HOW

09:21:13.539 --> 09:21:15.208
THAT FUNDING IS SPENT. DO YOU

09:21:15.274 --> 09:21:17.176
KNOW WHO IS THE HEAD OF THAT

09:21:17.243 --> 09:21:18.411
COUNCIL? THE CHIEF PROBATION

09:21:18.478 --> 09:21:19.812
OFFICER? THE CHIEF PROBATION

09:21:19.879 --> 09:21:21.314
OFFICER DETERMINES HOW THAT

09:21:21.381 --> 09:21:24.484
FUNDING IS SPENT. SO IT'S NOT ON

09:21:24.550 --> 09:21:26.452
ANYONE ELSE BUT THE CHIEF

09:21:26.519 --> 09:21:27.086
PROBATION OFFICER TO DETERMINE

09:21:27.153 --> 09:21:28.955
HOW THAT FUNDING IS SPENT. AND

09:21:29.022 --> 09:21:31.858
THEY SAT ON CLOSE TO $80

09:21:31.924 --> 09:21:33.860
MILLION. SO I WE KEEP POINTING

09:21:33.926 --> 09:21:35.661
FINGERS HERE AND THERE, HERE AND

09:21:35.728 --> 09:21:37.096
THERE. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS

09:21:37.163 --> 09:21:38.865
KIDS ARE DYING. THE BOTTOM LINE

09:21:38.931 --> 09:21:41.167
IS 30 OFFICERS WERE INDICTED FOR

09:21:41.234 --> 09:21:43.202
RUNNING A GLADIATOR FIGHT. ONE

09:21:43.269 --> 09:21:44.237
OFFICER JUST ARRESTED A COUPLE

09:21:44.303 --> 09:21:46.472
WEEKS AGO FOR BRINGING IN DRUGS

09:21:46.539 --> 09:21:50.043
AT 12. $7 MILLION LAWSUIT OR

09:21:50.109 --> 09:21:51.144
SETTLEMENT FOR THE TEAM THAT GOT

09:21:51.210 --> 09:21:53.279
BEAT UP, $4 MILLION FOR LAWSUITS

09:21:53.346 --> 09:21:54.313
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT BECAUSE THEY

09:21:54.380 --> 09:21:55.915
WERE RAPING OTHER WOMEN AND BOYS

09:21:55.982 --> 09:21:58.017
IN THERE, THE GIRLS AND BOYS IN

09:21:58.084 --> 09:22:00.620
THERE. SO I RESPECTFULLY AM

09:22:00.686 --> 09:22:02.422
TIRED OF EXCUSES. AND I'VE HAD

09:22:02.488 --> 09:22:04.457
THREE YEARS CONVERSATIONS WITH

09:22:04.524 --> 09:22:05.825
PROBATION AND NO AMENDMENT HAS

09:22:05.892 --> 09:22:08.161
BEEN PROPOSED TO ME. WE ARE ALL

09:22:08.227 --> 09:22:09.595
LEGISLATORS HERE. YOU KNOW HOW

09:22:09.662 --> 09:22:11.431
HARD IT IS TO GET THESE BILLS

09:22:11.497 --> 09:22:13.132
THROUGH. AND IF WE DON'T GET

09:22:13.199 --> 09:22:13.866
AMENDMENTS FOR OPPOSITION, HOW

09:22:13.933 --> 09:22:15.168
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO WORK ON THAT?

09:22:15.234 --> 09:22:17.236
ALL THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE

09:22:17.303 --> 09:22:18.037
BEEN TAKEN SO FAR HAVE BEEN BY

09:22:18.104 --> 09:22:20.106
MY COLLEAGUES AND BY THE

09:22:20.173 --> 09:22:21.474
COMMITTEE, BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO

09:22:21.541 --> 09:22:22.975
WORK IN GOOD FAITH TO FIX THE

09:22:23.042 --> 09:22:25.244
SITUATION IN MY COUNTY, BECAUSE

09:22:25.311 --> 09:22:25.878
WHILE THIS IS GOING TO BE A TWO

09:22:25.945 --> 09:22:27.613
YEAR BILL, ANOTHER KID COULD DIE

09:22:27.680 --> 09:22:29.715
IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS. OKAY,

09:22:29.782 --> 09:22:30.349
THAT'S LITERALLY THE REALITY IN

09:22:30.416 --> 09:22:31.918
LA COUNTY. KIDS ARE LITERALLY

09:22:31.984 --> 09:22:35.621
DYING IN OVERDOSING. SO I DON'T

09:22:35.688 --> 09:22:37.690
WANT TO SIT AROUND ANYMORE TO

09:22:37.757 --> 09:22:39.092
POINT THIS, THIS AND THAT. THIS

09:22:39.158 --> 09:22:40.359
IS THE ONLY SOLUTION ON THE

09:22:40.426 --> 09:22:42.361
TABLE RIGHT NOW. PROPOSE ME

09:22:42.428 --> 09:22:44.197
ANOTHER SOLUTION. AND WE'RE WORK

09:22:44.263 --> 09:22:45.531
ON IT. BUT I HAVE NOTHING ELSE

09:22:45.598 --> 09:22:47.433
TO WORK WITH, AND WE NEED TO

09:22:47.500 --> 09:22:49.302
MOVE FORWARD IN BRINGING SOME

09:22:49.368 --> 09:22:55.074
SUPPORT. FOR YOU. YES. JUST TO

09:22:55.141 --> 09:22:57.877
GO TO THE YOU WOULD WE WOULD GET

09:22:57.944 --> 09:22:59.946
IF IT MAKES IT OUT OF THE

09:23:00.012 --> 09:23:01.314
COMMITTEE IT WOULD GO TO THE

09:23:01.380 --> 09:23:02.982
FLOOR. BUT WE'RE NOT VOTING ON

09:23:03.049 --> 09:23:05.818
IT THIS YEAR BECAUSE IT IS GOING

09:23:05.885 --> 09:23:07.253
TO BE A TWO YEAR BILL. IS THAT

09:23:07.320 --> 09:23:08.254
CORRECT? CORRECT. SO THE WAY

09:23:08.321 --> 09:23:09.021
THAT IT WILL WORK PROCEDURALLY

09:23:09.088 --> 09:23:10.056
IS THAT SENATOR MENGIBAR, AFTER

09:23:10.123 --> 09:23:11.824
IT ADVANCES OUT OF COMMITTEE, I

09:23:11.891 --> 09:23:13.326
DON'T BELIEVE IT'S KI¾M FISCAL.

09:23:13.392 --> 09:23:14.093
SOMEONE CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M

09:23:14.160 --> 09:23:15.928
WRONG. SO IT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE

09:23:15.995 --> 09:23:18.131
FOR THE FLOOR. WHAT SHE WILL DO

09:23:18.197 --> 09:23:19.665
INSTEAD IS PUT IT IN THE

09:23:19.732 --> 09:23:21.567
INACTIVE FILE SO IT WOULD NOT GO

09:23:21.634 --> 09:23:23.603
UP FOR A VOTE IN THE YEAR 2025.

09:23:23.669 --> 09:23:24.203
THAT'S THE AGREEMENT THAT HAS

09:23:24.270 --> 09:23:25.838
THAT HAS BEEN STRUCK. IF THERE

09:23:25.905 --> 09:23:27.340
WERE A SIGNIFICANT POLICY

09:23:27.406 --> 09:23:29.442
CHANGE, WHETHER SHE MET WITH THE

09:23:29.509 --> 09:23:30.743
OPPOSITION AND WANTED TO

09:23:30.810 --> 09:23:31.911
DRASTICALLY REDO THE BILL, OR

09:23:31.978 --> 09:23:33.412
WHETHER LA COUNTY JUST FELT IT

09:23:33.479 --> 09:23:34.547
WAS UNWORKABLE AND WANTED TO

09:23:34.614 --> 09:23:35.748
SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE BILL,

09:23:35.815 --> 09:23:37.683
THE COMMITTEE WOULD HAVE THE

09:23:37.750 --> 09:23:39.118
AUTHORITY TO ROPE THAT BILL BACK

09:23:39.185 --> 09:23:40.353
IN, BECAUSE IT'S SUBSTANTIALLY

09:23:40.419 --> 09:23:41.687
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WAS PASSED

09:23:41.754 --> 09:23:44.190
OUT. BUT AS IT WOULD SIT AFTER

09:23:44.257 --> 09:23:45.825
COMMITTEE, IT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE

09:23:45.892 --> 09:23:47.059
FOR A FLOOR VOTE NEXT YEAR. AND

09:23:47.126 --> 09:23:48.728
I WILL NOTE THAT THE SPEAKER'S

09:23:48.794 --> 09:23:50.029
OFFICE IS AWARE OF THIS

09:23:50.096 --> 09:23:51.063
AGREEMENT AND WILL BE TRACKING

09:23:51.130 --> 09:23:52.231
IT. AND THAT IS THE

09:23:52.298 --> 09:23:53.966
UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE WILL BE

09:23:54.033 --> 09:23:55.768
NO VOTE ON THIS ON THE FLOOR IN

09:23:55.835 --> 09:23:57.603
2025. AND WHAT IS THE REASON WHY

09:23:57.670 --> 09:23:59.105
WE CAN'T SEND IT BACK SO THAT

09:23:59.172 --> 09:24:00.806
OPPOSITION CAN WORK WITH HER ON

09:24:00.873 --> 09:24:02.842
THIS AND THEN BRING IT BACK NEXT

09:24:02.909 --> 09:24:04.877
YEAR? ARE YOU REFERRING TO

09:24:04.944 --> 09:24:07.613
HOLDING IT IN COMMITTEE AS A TWO

09:24:07.680 --> 09:24:08.281
YEAR BILL? RIGHT. SORRY, BEFORE

09:24:08.347 --> 09:24:09.849
I ANSWER, IS THAT OKAY? I DON'T

09:24:09.916 --> 09:24:11.484
WANT TO SPEAK FOR SENATOR

09:24:11.551 --> 09:24:12.685
MENGIBAR, SO I WILL GIVE MY

09:24:12.752 --> 09:24:14.854
PERSPECTIVE. I THINK AS THE

09:24:14.921 --> 09:24:15.988
AUTHOR, IT'S ONLY FAIR THAT SHE

09:24:16.055 --> 09:24:17.723
ANSWER IN HER OWN WORDS, BUT I

09:24:17.790 --> 09:24:19.091
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE'S

09:24:19.158 --> 09:24:21.327
A BIT OF CONCERN THAT IF IT'S

09:24:21.394 --> 09:24:22.161
HELD IN COMMITTEE, WE'LL BE

09:24:22.228 --> 09:24:23.863
RIGHT BACK HERE NEXT YEAR. IT

09:24:23.930 --> 09:24:25.364
DOES NOT, AS THE CHAIR OF THIS

09:24:25.431 --> 09:24:27.333
COMMITTEE AND HAVING SPOKEN WITH

09:24:27.400 --> 09:24:28.935
ALL SIDES, IT DOESN'T SEEM A LOT

09:24:29.001 --> 09:24:31.237
OF YOU ARE TALKING AT ME AND

09:24:31.304 --> 09:24:31.904
WITH MY STAFF, AND I DON'T SEE A

09:24:31.971 --> 09:24:33.973
LOT OF SPEAKING WITH EACH OTHER.

09:24:34.040 --> 09:24:35.942
I THINK THAT MOVING THE BILL OUT

09:24:36.008 --> 09:24:36.976
OF COMMITTEE AND AT LEAST

09:24:37.043 --> 09:24:39.045
POISING IT FOR A FLOOR VOTE NEXT

09:24:39.111 --> 09:24:39.679
YEAR FORCES THAT CONVERSATION.

09:24:39.745 --> 09:24:41.080
IT FORCES FOLKS TO GET SERIOUS

09:24:41.147 --> 09:24:42.114
AND COME TO THE TABLE AND

09:24:42.181 --> 09:24:43.883
ACTUALLY HAVE A CONVERSATION.

09:24:43.950 --> 09:24:45.551
I'LL ADD ONE MORE THING. IF LA

09:24:45.618 --> 09:24:46.986
COUNTY FEELS THAT THE BILL IS

09:24:47.053 --> 09:24:48.421
AMENDED IS UNWORKABLE, IT GIVES

09:24:48.487 --> 09:24:49.755
YOU SIX MONTHS TO DEMONSTRATE TO

09:24:49.822 --> 09:24:51.691
ME AND TO THE COMMITTEE THAT THE

09:24:51.757 --> 09:24:52.725
AMENDMENTS ARE UNWORKABLE TO

09:24:52.792 --> 09:24:54.293
PROBATION. IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE

09:24:54.360 --> 09:24:55.661
A BETTER SOLUTION OR YOU CAN

09:24:55.728 --> 09:24:57.530
CORRECT THE DEFICIENCIES, IT

09:24:57.597 --> 09:24:58.064
GIVES YOU SIX MONTHS TO

09:24:58.130 --> 09:24:59.498
DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS BILL IS

09:24:59.565 --> 09:25:01.300
UNNECESSARY, BUT IT IMPOSES SOME

09:25:01.367 --> 09:25:02.435
SORT OF TIME FRAME TO REVISIT

09:25:02.501 --> 09:25:04.537
THE CONVERSATION. RATHER THIS IN

09:25:04.604 --> 09:25:06.005
RATHER THAN THIS INDEFINITE

09:25:06.072 --> 09:25:07.406
CYCLE THAT WE SEEM TO HAVE BEEN

09:25:07.473 --> 09:25:09.041
IN, OF TALKING AT EACH OTHER,

09:25:09.108 --> 09:25:10.309
NOT WITH EACH OTHER, AND DOING

09:25:10.376 --> 09:25:12.078
NOTHING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM,

09:25:12.144 --> 09:25:13.212
WHICH IS PROBABLY THE ONLY POINT

09:25:13.279 --> 09:25:14.947
OF COMMON GROUND THAT I GET IN

09:25:15.014 --> 09:25:16.983
THE ROOM. AS WE ALL AGREE,

09:25:17.049 --> 09:25:19.151
THERE'S A PROBLEM, AND IT SHOULD

09:25:19.218 --> 09:25:19.819
PROBABLY BE ADDRESSED WITH THAT.

09:25:19.885 --> 09:25:21.087
SENATOR MENGIBAR, YOU ARE THE

09:25:21.153 --> 09:25:22.188
AUTHOR. IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING IN

09:25:22.255 --> 09:25:23.689
YOUR OWN WORDS TO ADD, PLEASE

09:25:23.756 --> 09:25:25.925
DO. I'LL LEAVE IT AT WHAT YOU

09:25:25.992 --> 09:25:28.394
ACTUALLY KNOW. I'LL LEAVE IT AT

09:25:28.461 --> 09:25:32.932
WHAT YOU SAID. I'M SORRY, I

09:25:32.999 --> 09:25:34.800
JUST. IT'S OKAY. I'M GOOD. YEAH.

09:25:34.867 --> 09:25:36.569
DID SHE ASK A QUESTION? I WAS

09:25:36.636 --> 09:25:38.638
JUST, I WAS I'M GOING TO GO OVER

09:25:38.704 --> 09:25:40.539
WHAT YOU WERE SAYING. SO IF WE I

09:25:40.606 --> 09:25:42.041
MEAN, I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD HOLD

09:25:42.108 --> 09:25:44.210
IT IN COMMITTEE SO THAT THE TWO

09:25:44.277 --> 09:25:46.712
CAN SPEAK AND WORK IT OUT,

09:25:46.779 --> 09:25:48.381
RATHER THAN MOVE IT OUT OF

09:25:48.447 --> 09:25:49.181
COMMITTEE AND THEN TAKING IT

09:25:49.248 --> 09:25:50.983
DIRECTLY TO THE FLOOR. BECAUSE

09:25:51.050 --> 09:25:53.019
HONESTLY, I I'M TORN HERE. I

09:25:53.085 --> 09:25:54.220
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE SENATOR IS

09:25:54.287 --> 09:25:55.755
DOING, BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND

09:25:55.821 --> 09:25:57.490
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE. I DON'T

09:25:57.556 --> 09:25:58.891
THINK THE TENURE OF THE FREEZING

09:25:58.958 --> 09:26:00.326
OF HIRING IN THE PROBATION

09:26:00.393 --> 09:26:01.227
DEPARTMENT HELPED WITH THIS AT

09:26:01.294 --> 09:26:03.129
ALL. I THINK WE'RE PLAYING CATCH

09:26:03.195 --> 09:26:05.131
UP NOW AND THIS IS WHAT LED TO

09:26:05.197 --> 09:26:06.899
THAT. IN ADDITION TO LAW

09:26:06.966 --> 09:26:07.533
ENFORCEMENT BEING PITCHED AS A

09:26:07.600 --> 09:26:09.468
BAD THING AND NOBODY WANTS TO GO

09:26:09.535 --> 09:26:10.436
INTO EVERYBODY IS DEALING WITH

09:26:10.503 --> 09:26:14.006
THAT RIGHT NOW. I FEEL LIKE AS A

09:26:14.073 --> 09:26:14.607
PERSON IN THE PUBLIC SAFETY

09:26:14.674 --> 09:26:16.242
COMMITTEE, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE

09:26:16.309 --> 09:26:17.810
THIS, COME BACK TO HEAR THIS

09:26:17.877 --> 09:26:18.711
CONVERSATION AND DISCUSS THIS

09:26:18.778 --> 09:26:20.513
THROUGH AS WELL, TO GETTING THIS

09:26:20.579 --> 09:26:22.048
OUT OF THE COMMITTEE TAKES US

09:26:22.114 --> 09:26:23.749
OUT OF THIS, ACTUALLY, AND IT

09:26:23.816 --> 09:26:25.117
JUST BRINGS IT RIGHT TO THE

09:26:25.184 --> 09:26:27.019
FLOOR FOR US TO KIND OF FIGURE

09:26:27.086 --> 09:26:28.821
THIS OUT ON THE FLOOR. AND I

09:26:28.888 --> 09:26:30.856
FEEL LIKE TAKING THIS TO THE

09:26:30.923 --> 09:26:31.757
COMMITTEE SO THAT WE CAN FIGURE

09:26:31.824 --> 09:26:33.726
IT OUT, AND THEN BRINGING IT TO

09:26:33.793 --> 09:26:35.094
THE FLOOR FOR OUR COLLEAGUES IS

09:26:35.161 --> 09:26:36.162
BETTER THAN JUST THROWING IT OUT

09:26:36.228 --> 09:26:38.898
TO THE TO THE FLOOR. SO MAYBE I

09:26:38.964 --> 09:26:42.368
WILL ANSWER NOW, MR. CHAIR. SO,

09:26:42.435 --> 09:26:44.136
ASSEMBLY MEMBER, YOU HAVE BILLS

09:26:44.203 --> 09:26:45.938
YOURSELF. YOU WOULD BE JUST AS

09:26:46.005 --> 09:26:47.740
FRUSTRATED AS I AM. AND

09:26:47.807 --> 09:26:48.908
RESPECTFULLY, YOU'RE ASKING ME

09:26:48.974 --> 09:26:50.242
FOR SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULDN'T

09:26:50.309 --> 09:26:51.911
TAKE EITHER. IF YOUR OPPOSITION

09:26:51.977 --> 09:26:53.312
HAS NOT WORKED WITH YOU IN GOOD

09:26:53.379 --> 09:26:55.014
FAITH, WHY WOULD YOU GIVE YOUR

09:26:55.081 --> 09:26:56.515
OPPOSITION MORE TIME TO WORK IF

09:26:56.582 --> 09:26:58.250
THEY HAVEN'T PROPOSED ANY

09:26:58.317 --> 09:26:59.685
AMENDMENT, AND YOU YOURSELF HAVE

09:26:59.752 --> 09:27:01.053
EMAILED AND EMAILED AND EMAILED

09:27:01.120 --> 09:27:03.656
THE OPPOSITION ASKING FOR HELP

09:27:03.723 --> 09:27:05.358
AND GUIDANCE IN GETTING AND

09:27:05.424 --> 09:27:06.792
LANDING ON THE RIGHT PAGE, AND

09:27:06.859 --> 09:27:08.627
NOT ONE AMENDMENT HAS BEEN

09:27:08.694 --> 09:27:10.396
PROPOSED, YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER

09:27:10.463 --> 09:27:12.565
WOULD NOT BE OKAY WITH THAT

09:27:12.631 --> 09:27:13.366
RELATIONSHIP. YOU'RE ASKING ME

09:27:13.432 --> 09:27:15.468
TO DO SOMETHING THAT YOU I DON'T

09:27:15.534 --> 09:27:16.602
THINK ANY LEGISLATOR WOULD WANT

09:27:16.669 --> 09:27:19.271
TO DO. SO I AM NOT GOING TO TAKE

09:27:19.338 --> 09:27:21.941
THAT THAT THAT PROPOSAL. SO IF I

09:27:22.007 --> 09:27:23.843
PUT IT ON THE FLOOR, THAT PUTS

09:27:23.909 --> 09:27:25.911
MORE FIRE UNDER ELLIE PROBATION

09:27:25.978 --> 09:27:27.446
TO GET THEIR ORGANIZATION IN

09:27:27.513 --> 09:27:29.181
ORDER THAT IF THEY DON'T, I HAVE

09:27:29.248 --> 09:27:31.817
THE ABILITY COME JANUARY 6TH TO

09:27:31.884 --> 09:27:33.886
BRING IT UP FOR A VOTE AND SET

09:27:33.953 --> 09:27:36.021
IT UP TO THE GOVERNOR. BUT IF I

09:27:36.088 --> 09:27:38.124
LEAVE IT IN HERE, THAT'S EVEN A

09:27:38.190 --> 09:27:39.258
LONGER PROCESS, BECAUSE IF

09:27:39.325 --> 09:27:40.726
ANOTHER KID DIES, I'M GOING TO

09:27:40.793 --> 09:27:42.862
BE OFF BECAUSE I'VE ALREADY HAD

09:27:42.928 --> 09:27:45.498
TO TURN THIS INTO A TWO YEAR

09:27:45.564 --> 09:27:46.832
BILL TO GET IT OUT OF COMMITTEE.

09:27:46.899 --> 09:27:49.001
BUT I WANT TO BE READY TO GO IF

09:27:49.068 --> 09:27:50.136
SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENS SO I CAN

09:27:50.202 --> 09:27:51.904
SEND IT UP TO THE GOVERNOR. SO

09:27:51.971 --> 09:27:53.105
RESPECTFULLY, I DON'T WANT TO

09:27:53.172 --> 09:27:54.907
HOLD THAT DEAL WAS NOT TO HOLD

09:27:54.974 --> 09:27:57.543
IT IN HERE BECAUSE I MADE DEALS

09:27:57.610 --> 09:27:58.944
TO GET ENOUGH VOTES OUT OF THIS

09:27:59.011 --> 09:27:59.812
COMMITTEE, AND THAT'S WHAT I'M

09:27:59.879 --> 09:28:05.351
GOING TO BE DOING. MR. GONZALEZ,

09:28:05.418 --> 09:28:07.620
I HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS, AND I

09:28:07.686 --> 09:28:08.921
APOLOGIZE TO MR. CHAIR, WHO I

09:28:08.988 --> 09:28:11.524
KNOW HAS STEPPED OUT. I WAS IN

09:28:11.590 --> 09:28:12.691
HEALTH COMMITTEE AND I WAS

09:28:12.758 --> 09:28:14.026
ADDING ON, ETC, AND I WANT TO

09:28:14.093 --> 09:28:15.628
THANK THE STAFF. I KNOW MISS

09:28:15.694 --> 09:28:17.730
RUBIO'S GOT TO GO TOO AT SOME

09:28:17.797 --> 09:28:19.598
POINT, BUT I DO HAVE A LOT OF

09:28:19.665 --> 09:28:20.933
IMPORTANT QUESTIONS ON THESE

09:28:21.000 --> 09:28:21.801
PIECES FOR ALL SIDES, AND I KNOW

09:28:21.867 --> 09:28:23.702
BOTH SIDES VERY WELL. I COME

09:28:23.769 --> 09:28:25.070
FROM THE SCHOOL OF MR. RALPH

09:28:25.137 --> 09:28:26.806
MILLER, REST HIS SOUL, AND SO I

09:28:26.872 --> 09:28:28.941
AM A HUGE FAN OF LABOR. I KNOW

09:28:29.008 --> 09:28:30.042
THE WORK THAT THE PROBATION

09:28:30.109 --> 09:28:31.444
DEPARTMENT HAS DONE. MY BROTHER

09:28:31.510 --> 09:28:33.479
HAS GONE THROUGH IT, AND I KNOW

09:28:33.546 --> 09:28:34.046
THE BENEFITS THAT COMMUNITY

09:28:34.113 --> 09:28:35.347
BASED ORGANIZATIONS HAVE

09:28:35.414 --> 09:28:36.015
SPECIFICALLY IN MY AREA, DELEON,

09:28:36.081 --> 09:28:38.217
BARRIOS, BARRIO ACTION AND SO

09:28:38.284 --> 09:28:39.685
MANY OTHERS. THIS SOME OF THESE

09:28:39.752 --> 09:28:41.187
PROGRAMS THAT WERE CREATED WERE

09:28:41.253 --> 09:28:43.722
MADE OUT OF MEASURE J, WHICH IS

09:28:43.789 --> 09:28:46.158
PART OF THIS REIMAGINED BALLOT

09:28:46.225 --> 09:28:48.060
MEASURE THAT UTILIZE PUBLIC

09:28:48.127 --> 09:28:49.295
SAFETY DOLLARS TO THEN CREATE

09:28:49.361 --> 09:28:54.133
THIS NEWER GROUP OF PEOPLE TO.

09:28:54.200 --> 09:28:56.135
GET THE YOUTH INTO PROGRAMS AND

09:28:56.202 --> 09:28:59.238
GET THEM OFF THE STREETS AND GET

09:28:59.305 --> 09:28:59.805
THEM INTO PLACES THAT WERE

09:28:59.872 --> 09:29:01.307
FAILING ELSEWHERE. SO I KIND OF

09:29:01.373 --> 09:29:02.141
HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR

09:29:02.208 --> 09:29:04.543
BOTH SIDES ON THIS PIECES OF IT,

09:29:04.610 --> 09:29:07.847
BUT I WANT TO JUST TO SORT OF ON

09:29:07.913 --> 09:29:10.716
THE MEASURE J COMPONENT OF IT.

09:29:10.783 --> 09:29:12.151
THE LA TIMES OBVIOUSLY REPORTED

09:29:12.218 --> 09:29:13.185
THAT STORY THE OTHER DAY, AND

09:29:13.252 --> 09:29:15.688
THIS CAN GO EITHER WAY. DOES

09:29:15.754 --> 09:29:16.789
THAT AFFECT THIS? WELL, I NEED

09:29:16.856 --> 09:29:17.923
SOMEONE TO EXPLAIN THAT PIECE OF

09:29:17.990 --> 09:29:20.359
IT. SORRY. NO, IT DOES NOT. IT

09:29:20.426 --> 09:29:22.127
DOES NOT. IT IS A TECHNICAL

09:29:22.194 --> 09:29:25.130
ADMINISTRATIVE ERROR. THAT WAS

09:29:25.197 --> 09:29:28.367
PART OF THE DAY TO DAY WORK FOR

09:29:28.434 --> 09:29:31.604
WHEN A BALLOT MEASURE IS PASSED.

09:29:31.670 --> 09:29:34.073
LONG STORY SHORT, MEASURE G

09:29:34.139 --> 09:29:35.975
REFORMED OUR COUNTY GOVERNANCE.

09:29:36.041 --> 09:29:38.010
IT DID NOT. IT WAS BASED ON AN

09:29:38.077 --> 09:29:39.645
ON AN UPDATED VERSION OF THE

09:29:39.712 --> 09:29:41.113
CHARTER. IT'S SUPER TECHNICAL

09:29:41.180 --> 09:29:43.415
THAT THE COUNTY COUNCIL AND OUR

09:29:43.482 --> 09:29:44.884
EXECUTIVE OFFICE WAS SUPPOSED TO

09:29:44.950 --> 09:29:46.685
UPDATE. THEY DID NOT. AND THAT

09:29:46.752 --> 09:29:49.555
ACCIDENTALLY, INADVERTENTLY

09:29:49.622 --> 09:29:51.390
UNDID MEASURE J. BUT ONE DOES

09:29:51.457 --> 09:29:53.425
NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH

09:29:53.492 --> 09:29:54.193
PROBATION. PROBATION IS FUNDED

09:29:54.260 --> 09:29:56.362
BY NET COUNTY COST, WHICH IS OUR

09:29:56.428 --> 09:29:57.496
GENERAL FUND DOLLARS. NOT BY

09:29:57.563 --> 09:29:59.865
MEASURE J BUT BUT THE DEED

09:29:59.932 --> 09:30:01.066
PROGRAM AND IF I'M. YES, THE

09:30:01.133 --> 09:30:03.569
DEED PROGRAM NOT FUNDED. NOT

09:30:03.636 --> 09:30:06.338
FUNDED BY THAT AT ALL. NO THAT'S

09:30:06.405 --> 09:30:07.006
THAT'S NOT THAT IS ALL. THAT IS

09:30:07.072 --> 09:30:08.407
NOT MEASURE J R. ALL RIGHT.

09:30:08.474 --> 09:30:11.143
THANK YOU FOR CLEARING THAT UP

09:30:11.210 --> 09:30:11.577
BECAUSE THAT WAS MY

09:30:11.644 --> 09:30:12.211
MISUNDERSTANDING. DID ALL FIVE

09:30:12.278 --> 09:30:14.847
OF THE SUPER ARE ALL FIVE OF THE

09:30:14.914 --> 09:30:15.714
SUPERVISORS IN SUPPORT OF THIS

09:30:15.781 --> 09:30:17.616
BILL? IT WAS UNANIMOUS. YES. AND

09:30:17.683 --> 09:30:19.018
THEN WHAT'S THE TRANSITION WHEN

09:30:19.084 --> 09:30:21.353
THE SUPERVISORS TRANSFERRED FROM

09:30:21.420 --> 09:30:23.022
5 TO 9. ARE THEY MANAGING THIS

09:30:23.088 --> 09:30:24.056
PROGRAM GOING FORWARD? SHOULD IT

09:30:24.123 --> 09:30:26.559
GO? SHOULD IT PASS? THIS WOULD

09:30:26.625 --> 09:30:29.562
BE NO, THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY

09:30:29.628 --> 09:30:32.631
MANAGED BY THE SUPERVISOR. THE

09:30:32.698 --> 09:30:34.133
SUPERVISORIAL DISTRICTS, BECAUSE

09:30:34.199 --> 09:30:36.368
THAT THAT EXPANSION WILL HAPPEN

09:30:36.435 --> 09:30:40.339
IN 2030, 2032 TO 2034. THEY'RE

09:30:40.406 --> 09:30:44.176
BY THEN IN 2028 WILL BE A COUNTY

09:30:44.243 --> 09:30:45.778
EXECUTIVE, MEANING AN EXECUTIVE

09:30:45.844 --> 09:30:47.079
BRANCH OF THE COUNTY WHO WILL BE

09:30:47.146 --> 09:30:50.115
IN CHARGE OF THE WELL, NOT IN

09:30:50.182 --> 09:30:51.817
CHARGE. BUT I GUESS A BETTER WAY

09:30:51.884 --> 09:30:53.185
OF SAYING WILL BE IN CHARGE OF

09:30:53.252 --> 09:30:55.020
APPOINTING ALL OF THE DEPARTMENT

09:30:55.087 --> 09:30:56.722
HEADS. AND SO IT'S THE COUNTY

09:30:56.789 --> 09:30:59.391
EXECUTIVE. TECHNICALLY, WITH THE

09:30:59.458 --> 09:31:01.193
VOTE OF THE LEGISLATURE, WHICH

09:31:01.260 --> 09:31:02.828
WILL BE THE EXPANDED BOARD, WHO

09:31:02.895 --> 09:31:04.330
WILL BE IN CHARGE TOGETHER.

09:31:04.396 --> 09:31:05.264
ASSEMBLY MEMBER, JUST LIKE ANY

09:31:05.331 --> 09:31:06.932
OTHER DEPARTMENT IN L.A. COUNTY,

09:31:06.999 --> 09:31:09.068
DCFS, TÌM, AND SO FORTH, ALL

09:31:09.134 --> 09:31:10.669
THOSE DEPARTMENTS ARE NOT GOING

09:31:10.736 --> 09:31:12.771
TO CHANGE WHEN THE BOARD

09:31:12.838 --> 09:31:15.274
INCREASES TO NINE SUPERVISORS.

09:31:15.341 --> 09:31:17.042
THAT WILL REMAIN THE SAME. I

09:31:17.109 --> 09:31:19.912
JUST WANTED JUST ONE CORRECTION

09:31:19.979 --> 09:31:21.447
TO THAT, AND THEY MAY NOT KNOW

09:31:21.513 --> 09:31:25.384
THIS. IN MAY OF 2016, THERE WAS

09:31:25.451 --> 09:31:27.419
AN ORDINANCE BY THE BOARD OF

09:31:27.486 --> 09:31:28.921
SUPERVISORS THAT THERE ARE TWO

09:31:28.988 --> 09:31:30.422
ENTITIES IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY

09:31:30.489 --> 09:31:32.091
THAT ARE DIRECTLY UNDER THE

09:31:32.157 --> 09:31:33.659
SUPERVISION OF THE BOARD OF

09:31:33.726 --> 09:31:34.593
SUPERVISORS, AND THAT WAS

09:31:34.660 --> 09:31:36.395
PROBATION AND DCFS. SO THEY

09:31:36.462 --> 09:31:37.997
DON'T GO THROUGH THE NORMAL

09:31:38.063 --> 09:31:39.598
CHANNEL OF THE CEO'S OFFICE. I

09:31:39.665 --> 09:31:41.233
DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS UNDONE BY

09:31:41.300 --> 09:31:44.436
MR. G, THOUGH. NO. WELL, WELL,

09:31:44.503 --> 09:31:45.938
MR. J, JUST TO MAKE SORRY,

09:31:46.005 --> 09:31:48.941
SORRY, SORRY. OKAY. SO LOOK, I

09:31:49.008 --> 09:31:50.442
WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND

09:31:50.509 --> 09:31:53.012
I'LL GET TO THE AUTHOR IN A

09:31:53.078 --> 09:31:54.380
SECOND. BUT LET ME ASK THIS

09:31:54.446 --> 09:31:54.980
FIRST. A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS

09:31:55.047 --> 09:31:56.982
ABOUT LOSS OF JOBS, PARTICULARLY

09:31:57.049 --> 09:31:59.151
UNION JOBS, PARTICULARLY THAT

09:31:59.218 --> 09:32:01.320
THIS IS A UNION BUSTING BILL.

09:32:01.387 --> 09:32:03.622
BUT IN PART OF THE AMENDMENTS

09:32:03.689 --> 09:32:05.891
THAT THE AUTHOR TOOK, IT SAYS IT

09:32:05.958 --> 09:32:07.993
HERE IN A FEW PLACES, THE COUNTY

09:32:08.060 --> 09:32:09.261
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SHALL

09:32:09.328 --> 09:32:11.563
DELEGATE ALL OR PART OF THESE

09:32:11.630 --> 09:32:12.431
DUTIES AND AUTHORITIES TO A

09:32:12.498 --> 09:32:13.165
COUNTY OFFICIAL THAT IS PART OF

09:32:13.232 --> 09:32:15.734
A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNIT. IS

09:32:15.801 --> 09:32:17.403
THAT NOT ACCEPTABLE? AND IF IT'S

09:32:17.469 --> 09:32:19.638
NOT, WHY NOT? WELL, WE HAD

09:32:19.705 --> 09:32:20.873
DISCUSSION EARLIER WHEN YOU WERE

09:32:20.939 --> 09:32:23.308
OUT. YES. AND ONE OF THE THINGS

09:32:23.375 --> 09:32:24.309
THAT IS MENTIONED THERE, THAT

09:32:24.376 --> 09:32:27.346
IT'S NOT THE LOSS OF A CURRENT

09:32:27.413 --> 09:32:30.015
JOB, CURRENT PEACE OFFICER, THE

09:32:30.082 --> 09:32:31.884
UNION IS CONCERNED THAT IT'S THE

09:32:31.950 --> 09:32:34.720
LOSS OF A UNION POSITION. IN

09:32:34.787 --> 09:32:38.290
OTHER WORDS, THE BILL IS WRITTEN

09:32:38.357 --> 09:32:41.994
TO SAY CURRENT EMPLOYED OFFICER,

09:32:42.061 --> 09:32:43.762
WHICH MEANS THAT I AM CURRENT

09:32:43.829 --> 09:32:45.097
EMPLOYED OFFICER, 33 YEARS AS A

09:32:45.164 --> 09:32:47.599
JUVENILE OFFICER. IF I LOST MY

09:32:47.666 --> 09:32:50.135
JOB RIGHT OR NOT BECAUSE OF

09:32:50.202 --> 09:32:54.473
THAT, IF I JUST RETIRED, THEN OF

09:32:54.540 --> 09:32:56.075
COURSE THEY COULD REPLACE IT

09:32:56.141 --> 09:32:58.744
WITH A NONUNION PERSON BECAUSE

09:32:58.811 --> 09:33:00.245
IT DOESN'T GIVE ANY GUARANTEE

09:33:00.312 --> 09:33:03.615
THAT THE POSITION WILL BE HELD.

09:33:03.682 --> 09:33:05.718
AND SO WE CALL IT ANTI-UNION

09:33:05.784 --> 09:33:08.654
BECAUSE IT USES THE WORDING IS

09:33:08.721 --> 09:33:09.688
IMPORTANT. IT USES THE TERM

09:33:09.755 --> 09:33:11.924
CURRENT. WHAT ABOUT FUTURE? WHAT

09:33:11.990 --> 09:33:13.992
ABOUT FUTURE OFFICERS? DOES IT

09:33:14.059 --> 09:33:16.228
TAKE CARE OF THAT? WHICH FUTURE

09:33:16.295 --> 09:33:17.830
OFFICERS? THE ONES THAT NEED TO

09:33:17.896 --> 09:33:20.499
BE HIRED SEE IT? IT ONLY SAYS

09:33:20.566 --> 09:33:22.034
THAT THE LOSS OF JOBS WILL NOT

09:33:22.101 --> 09:33:25.204
AFFECT THE CURRENT OFFICERS,

09:33:25.270 --> 09:33:29.475
RIGHT? YOU PLAN. YOU DO PLAN TO

09:33:29.541 --> 09:33:31.443
HAVE FUTURE OFFICERS. BUT IF THE

09:33:31.510 --> 09:33:34.113
BILL IS RE IS COMPLETELY

09:33:34.179 --> 09:33:35.647
CHANGING THE OR MOVING THE

09:33:35.714 --> 09:33:37.082
DEPARTMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY TO

09:33:37.149 --> 09:33:38.584
CHANGING IT. AND IT'S THE

09:33:38.650 --> 09:33:39.952
PROVISION IS PART OF THE

09:33:40.018 --> 09:33:41.053
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNIT. THAT

09:33:41.120 --> 09:33:42.755
UNIT WOULD THEN THEREFORE BE

09:33:42.821 --> 09:33:43.388
UNIONIZED SO THE POSITIONS WOULD

09:33:43.455 --> 09:33:45.858
STILL EXIST. YOU'RE SAYING THAT

09:33:45.924 --> 09:33:47.226
IT'S NOT. THERE'S TWO THINGS.

09:33:47.292 --> 09:33:49.161
I'M SORRY. I JUST WANT TO MAKE

09:33:49.228 --> 09:33:51.296
SURE WE MAKE SURE WE'RE CLEAR.

09:33:51.363 --> 09:33:51.830
THERE'S TWO THINGS THAT I

09:33:51.897 --> 09:33:54.333
THOUGHT I SAW IN THE AMENDMENT.

09:33:54.399 --> 09:33:55.100
ONE WAS THAT THE HEAD OF THE

09:33:55.167 --> 09:33:57.603
PROBATION DEPARTMENT NEED TO BE

09:33:57.669 --> 09:33:58.270
PART OF A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

09:33:58.337 --> 09:34:00.139
UNIT. I DON'T CLEARLY KNOW WHAT

09:34:00.205 --> 09:34:01.173
THAT MEANS IN TERMS OF A

09:34:01.240 --> 09:34:03.008
DEPARTMENT HEAD. NONE OF THEM

09:34:03.075 --> 09:34:04.710
ARE PART OF A COLLECTIVE

09:34:04.777 --> 09:34:06.912
BARGAINING UNIT, PER SE. AND

09:34:06.979 --> 09:34:08.914
THEN THERE'S THE PART THAT TALKS

09:34:08.981 --> 09:34:10.616
ABOUT THERE WILL BE NO LOSS OF

09:34:10.682 --> 09:34:12.684
THE CURRENT OFFICER. THE WORD

09:34:12.751 --> 09:34:14.920
CURRENT IS CONFUSING. WE HAD A

09:34:14.987 --> 09:34:16.889
WE HAD A DISCUSSION ON CLARITY.

09:34:16.955 --> 09:34:18.457
WHEN THE BILL IS PRESENTED. I

09:34:18.524 --> 09:34:19.992
WAS HOPING IT WOULD BE CLEARER

09:34:20.058 --> 09:34:22.661
ON ITS MEANING. THAT IS UNCLEAR

09:34:22.728 --> 09:34:25.164
BECAUSE IT TALKS ABOUT CURRENT

09:34:25.230 --> 09:34:27.099
OFFICERS. IT DOESN'T TALK ABOUT

09:34:27.166 --> 09:34:28.934
MAINTAINING THE POSITION IN THE

09:34:29.001 --> 09:34:30.202
BARGAINING UNIT. IT JUST SAYS

09:34:30.269 --> 09:34:32.471
THAT THERE WILL BE NO LOSS OF A

09:34:32.538 --> 09:34:34.406
CURRENT EMPLOYMENT. SO. SO

09:34:34.473 --> 09:34:36.074
SHOULD THIS GET OUT OF COMMITTEE

09:34:36.141 --> 09:34:38.644
TODAY? AND KEEPING IN MIND THE

09:34:38.710 --> 09:34:40.112
DEFINITION OF THAT PIECE, AS

09:34:40.179 --> 09:34:43.348
MUCH AS YOU CAN RESPOND TO,

09:34:43.415 --> 09:34:45.117
SENATOR, IS THAT WILL THAT BE

09:34:45.184 --> 09:34:46.485
PART OF THE DIALOG? SHOULD THEY

09:34:46.552 --> 09:34:48.387
YOU GUYS BE FORCED INTO A

09:34:48.453 --> 09:34:49.488
CONVERSATION THAT I WISH SOMEONE

09:34:49.555 --> 09:34:50.489
WOULD FORCE US INTO A

09:34:50.556 --> 09:34:51.190
CONVERSATION? MAYBE THAT

09:34:51.256 --> 09:34:52.991
POSITION WOULD TALK TO ME ABOUT

09:34:53.058 --> 09:34:55.227
THIS BILL. BUT WHAT I ANSWERED

09:34:55.294 --> 09:34:56.094
BEFORE IS THAT THERE'S A

09:34:56.161 --> 09:34:57.362
PREVIOUS AMENDMENT THAT I

09:34:57.429 --> 09:34:59.064
ALREADY TOOK TO THE BILL, THAT

09:34:59.131 --> 09:35:00.399
IT'S NOT PART OF COMMITTEE

09:35:00.465 --> 09:35:01.700
AMENDMENTS. THESE WERE MY

09:35:01.767 --> 09:35:03.502
AMENDMENTS THAT SAID NO PEACE

09:35:03.569 --> 09:35:05.337
OFFICER DUTY ROLE SHALL BE

09:35:05.404 --> 09:35:07.105
REPLACED BY A NON PEACE OFFICER

09:35:07.172 --> 09:35:09.675
DUTY. SO TO HIS POINT THAT IF

09:35:09.741 --> 09:35:11.043
SOMEONE RETIRES AND LEAVES THE

09:35:11.109 --> 09:35:12.945
FORCE, A PEACE OFFICER CAN ONLY

09:35:13.011 --> 09:35:15.080
BE REPLACED BY ANOTHER PEACE

09:35:15.147 --> 09:35:16.782
OFFICER. SO EVEN THOUGH IT SAYS

09:35:16.849 --> 09:35:17.783
CURRENTLY A DIFFERENT AMENDMENT

09:35:17.850 --> 09:35:21.887
ALREADY ADDRESSES THE ISSUE TO

09:35:21.954 --> 09:35:23.622
REPLACING A PEACE OFFICER WITH

09:35:23.689 --> 09:35:25.123
ANOTHER PEACE OFFICER. AND IN

09:35:25.190 --> 09:35:26.859
OUR CONVERSATIONS, THIS IS NOT

09:35:26.925 --> 09:35:28.327
AN ATTACK ON LABOR. IT'S AN

09:35:28.393 --> 09:35:29.494
ATTACK ON A SYSTEM THAT'S

09:35:29.561 --> 09:35:31.129
FAILING, AND IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE

09:35:31.196 --> 09:35:32.698
REHABILITATING OUR YOUTH. AND SO

09:35:32.764 --> 09:35:34.466
THAT THAT'S THE CLEAR

09:35:34.533 --> 09:35:35.234
DISTINCTION I WANT TO MAKE. AND

09:35:35.300 --> 09:35:37.870
YOU AND I AND I WANT TO GIVE,

09:35:37.936 --> 09:35:39.371
GIVE SOME KUDOS TO THE AUTHOR.

09:35:39.438 --> 09:35:41.039
WE HAD A VERY TOUGH CONVERSATION

09:35:41.106 --> 09:35:42.140
AND WE GOT TO WE GOT TO THIS

09:35:42.207 --> 09:35:43.876
POINT IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS,

09:35:43.942 --> 09:35:45.811
AND I SPOKE TO MANY FOLKS AROUND

09:35:45.878 --> 09:35:47.379
THE DAIS TODAY ABOUT THAT. AND

09:35:47.446 --> 09:35:49.948
YOU'VE HAD THREE YEARS TO DO IT.

09:35:50.015 --> 09:35:52.584
SO AS PART OF THAT AND YOU'VE

09:35:52.651 --> 09:35:54.186
BEEN WORKING ON IT AND THERE'S A

09:35:54.253 --> 09:35:55.654
MASSIVE TIMELINE, AND THIS IS A

09:35:55.721 --> 09:35:56.755
LITTLE BIT MORE DIRECTED TO

09:35:56.822 --> 09:35:58.790
PROBATION TEAM. IN OCTOBER OF

09:35:58.857 --> 09:35:59.324
2019, BOARD OF SUPERVISORS

09:35:59.391 --> 09:36:00.292
APPROVED THE CREATION OF THE

09:36:00.359 --> 09:36:01.460
NATION'S FIRST PROBATION

09:36:01.526 --> 09:36:03.595
OVERSIGHT COMMISSION. 2019, AND

09:36:03.662 --> 09:36:05.030
THEN THIS TIMELINE GOES ON TO

09:36:05.097 --> 09:36:07.165
SAY, IN THE FIRST IN JULY OF

09:36:07.232 --> 09:36:09.034
2022, IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS,

09:36:09.101 --> 09:36:10.269
INCIDENTS INVOLVING OFFICERS

09:36:10.335 --> 09:36:11.837
USING FORCE ON A YOUTH JUMPED BY

09:36:11.904 --> 09:36:14.139
50% COMPARED TO THE FIRST HALF

09:36:14.206 --> 09:36:15.240
OF 2021, AND THE NUMBER OF TIMES

09:36:15.307 --> 09:36:16.174
THAT YOUTHS WERE PAPERS WERE

09:36:16.241 --> 09:36:18.043
PEPPER SPRAYED, QUADRUPLED IN

09:36:18.110 --> 09:36:20.212
THE SAME TIME FRAME. AND THEN IN

09:36:20.279 --> 09:36:22.281
AUGUST OF 22, 70 WOMEN FILED

09:36:22.347 --> 09:36:23.348
LAWSUITS ALLEGING SEXUAL ASSAULT

09:36:23.415 --> 09:36:24.850
AGAINST L.A. COUNTY JUVENILE

09:36:24.917 --> 09:36:26.285
PROBATION OFFICERS. NOVEMBER OF

09:36:26.351 --> 09:36:27.753
22 MAJOR STAFFING ISSUES

09:36:27.819 --> 09:36:29.354
CONTINUE, INCLUDING 27% OF

09:36:29.421 --> 09:36:31.590
JUVENILE HALL EMPLOYEES OR 329

09:36:31.657 --> 09:36:33.525
OFFICERS ARE OUT ON LEAVE ON A

LIGHT DUTY. UNSAFE CONDITIONS

09:36:35.027 --> 09:36:36.728
PERSIST FOR YOUTH IN AT LEAST

09:36:36.795 --> 09:36:38.263
SEVEN MONTHS. JULY OF 23, L.A.

09:36:38.330 --> 09:36:39.665

EVENTS ON SPOTLIGHTING ON THE

09:37:41.793 --> 09:37:44.062
PROBATION DEPARTMENT? DO YOU

09:37:44.129 --> 09:37:45.797
WANT ME TO TAKE IT ONE BY ONE?

09:37:45.864 --> 09:37:47.499
YOU CAN TELL ME HOW TO DEFEND.

09:37:47.566 --> 09:37:50.469
WELL, LET ME JUST GIVE YOU AN

09:37:50.535 --> 09:37:51.136
OVERVIEW. FIRST OF ALL, THERE IS

09:37:51.203 --> 09:37:52.537
A STAFFING SHORTAGE IN L.A.

09:37:52.604 --> 09:37:55.040
COUNTY. PROBATION. THE BOARD OF

09:37:55.107 --> 09:37:56.208
SUPERVISORS FOR YEARS HAD A

09:37:56.274 --> 09:37:58.010
HIRING FREEZE, AND NOW THEY'RE

09:37:58.076 --> 09:37:59.411
PLAYING CATCH UP. ATTRITION

09:37:59.478 --> 09:38:01.613
RATES OUTNUMBER THE HIRING RATES

09:38:01.680 --> 09:38:03.715
BECAUSE OF THE IDEOLOGY THAT NO

09:38:03.782 --> 09:38:06.318
YOUTH SHOULD BE INCARCERATED. LA

09:38:06.385 --> 09:38:07.753
COUNTY USED TO HOUSE 3000 YOUTH

09:38:07.819 --> 09:38:10.689
IN ONE DAY. WE NOW HAVE LIMITED

09:38:10.756 --> 09:38:13.859
THAT TO 500 TO 600 YOUTH AT ANY

09:38:13.925 --> 09:38:16.728
ONE TIME. IF YOU TALK ABOUT THE

09:38:16.795 --> 09:38:17.696
LAWSUITS ON THE SEXUAL

09:38:17.763 --> 09:38:19.898
ALLEGATIONS, YOU SAID THERE WERE

09:38:19.965 --> 09:38:21.767
70 CASES. THE MAJORITY OF THE

09:38:21.833 --> 09:38:25.570
CASES THAT EXIST ARE FOR PEOPLE

09:38:25.637 --> 09:38:27.305
WHO ARE NOT CURRENTLY EMPLOYED.

09:38:27.372 --> 09:38:31.443
IT GOES BACK 30 TO 40 YEARS. NO

09:38:31.510 --> 09:38:33.979
JUSTIFICATION FOR THAT. WHAT I

09:38:34.046 --> 09:38:36.348
SAID EARLIER WAS THE STATE OF

09:38:36.415 --> 09:38:37.682
CALIFORNIA HAS MANDATED THAT

09:38:37.749 --> 09:38:40.152
PROBATION EXIST. IN 2000, THERE

09:38:40.218 --> 09:38:41.987
WAS PROBATION SERVICES TASK

09:38:42.054 --> 09:38:44.489
FORCE THAT THE STATE OF

09:38:44.556 --> 09:38:45.390
CALIFORNIA GAVE THEM THREE YEARS

09:38:45.457 --> 09:38:47.559
TO DO THE PROPER REVIEW TO MAKE

09:38:47.626 --> 09:38:50.262
SURE THAT PROBATION BE REFORMED.

09:38:50.328 --> 09:38:56.068
IN JULY OF 2003, THEY PRODUCED A

09:38:56.134 --> 09:38:58.470
549 PAGE REPORT AND MADE 17

09:38:58.537 --> 09:39:00.305
RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE STATE. IN

09:39:00.372 --> 09:39:02.874
THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE THE

09:39:02.941 --> 09:39:05.043
THINGS THAT WILL CAUSE US TO

09:39:05.110 --> 09:39:06.678
HAVE THE REFORMS WE NEED IN

09:39:06.745 --> 09:39:08.580
PROBATION. WHERE WE OBJECT WITH

09:39:08.647 --> 09:39:10.382
THE AUTHOR IS THE AUTHOR IS

09:39:10.449 --> 09:39:12.984
TRYING TO GO OUTSIDE OF THE

09:39:13.051 --> 09:39:15.053
PROBATION DEPARTMENT TO CURE A

09:39:15.120 --> 09:39:17.222
PROBLEM THAT EXISTS INSIDE THE

09:39:17.289 --> 09:39:19.257
PROBATION DEPARTMENT, FOR

09:39:19.324 --> 09:39:21.593
INSTANCE, THE USE OF DIED WHO

09:39:21.660 --> 09:39:23.895
HAS NOT BEEN IN EXISTENCE LONGER

09:39:23.962 --> 09:39:26.598
THAN TWO AND A HALF YEARS, HAVE

09:39:26.665 --> 09:39:29.401
NOT HAD TO TREAT OR TO HANDLE

09:39:29.468 --> 09:39:30.936
THE POPULATION THAT WE CURRENTLY

09:39:31.002 --> 09:39:34.306
HANDLE, WHICH IS 770 OFFENDERS.

09:39:34.372 --> 09:39:36.741
HIGH LEVEL VIOLATIONS, RAPE,

09:39:36.808 --> 09:39:38.777
MURDERS AND SUCH. FORTH. RIGHT.

09:39:38.844 --> 09:39:40.412
AND SO WHEN YOU WHEN YOU BRING

09:39:40.479 --> 09:39:42.114
UP THESE THINGS, SOMEBODY EVEN

09:39:42.180 --> 09:39:43.782
SAID THERE'S A CALL OUT RATIO

09:39:43.849 --> 09:39:46.017
THAT'S HIGH BECAUSE OF THE

09:39:46.084 --> 09:39:48.386
STAFFING SHORTAGE. THE CHIEF HAS

09:39:48.453 --> 09:39:50.355
DESIGNED IN HIS MIND TO GO AND

09:39:50.422 --> 09:39:52.023
USE FIELD OFFICERS THAT WORK

09:39:52.090 --> 09:39:54.392
WITH ADULTS AND SEND THEM INTO

09:39:54.459 --> 09:39:56.094
THE INSTITUTIONS. SOME OF THEM

09:39:56.161 --> 09:39:59.131
ARE HELD OVER 16, SOME OF THEM

09:39:59.197 --> 09:40:00.499
WORK 24 HOURS AND THEIR SHIFT

09:40:00.565 --> 09:40:02.667
STARTS THE NEXT DAY. CAN YOU

09:40:02.734 --> 09:40:04.703
IMAGINE WORKING 16 TO 24 HOURS

09:40:04.769 --> 09:40:06.671
WHEN YOU'RE USED TO WORKING

09:40:06.738 --> 09:40:07.873
EIGHT HOURS AND THEN YOU HAVE TO

09:40:07.939 --> 09:40:09.541
GO BACK? THAT'S CALLED A CALL

09:40:09.608 --> 09:40:11.610
OUT. A LOT OF TECHNICALITIES ARE

09:40:11.676 --> 09:40:14.179
THERE THAT CAN BE EXPLAINED. AND

09:40:14.246 --> 09:40:15.213
WE'VE SPOKEN TO MANY OF YOU

09:40:15.280 --> 09:40:17.349
OFFICERS AND TRIED TO GIVE CLEAR

09:40:17.415 --> 09:40:19.851
DEFINITION. WHAT WE BELIEVE IS

09:40:19.918 --> 09:40:21.820
THAT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO LOOK

09:40:21.887 --> 09:40:23.021
IN PROBATION AND MAKE THE

09:40:23.088 --> 09:40:25.490
REFORMS THAT YOU NEED. FOR

09:40:25.557 --> 09:40:27.759
INSTANCE, IF YOU TALK ABOUT THE

09:40:27.826 --> 09:40:29.694
SENATOR MENTIONED ABOUT THE JJ,

09:40:29.761 --> 09:40:31.796
BG OR WHATEVER IT IS, BUT 2000,

09:40:31.863 --> 09:40:33.832
IT WAS CALLED THE SHIFT CARDENAS

09:40:33.899 --> 09:40:36.334
THAT ALLOCATED MONEY TOWARD

09:40:36.401 --> 09:40:37.936
JUVENILES. THEN THEY CHANGED IT

09:40:38.003 --> 09:40:39.271
TO THE JUVENILE JUSTICE

09:40:39.337 --> 09:40:40.438
COORDINATING COUNCIL. THEN THEY

09:40:40.505 --> 09:40:42.407
PUT THE CHIEF ON THE HEAD OF

09:40:42.474 --> 09:40:46.178
THAT IN THAT FUNDING, WE

09:40:46.244 --> 09:40:49.247
ALLOCATE OVER 75 MILLION TO 100

09:40:49.314 --> 09:40:51.183
MILLION TO CBOS. THE WORK THAT

09:40:51.249 --> 09:40:53.318
WE SEE IN THE BILL THAT THE

09:40:53.385 --> 09:40:56.488
AUTHOR IS ASKING TO BE DONE TO,

09:40:56.555 --> 09:40:59.925
IN HER MIND, ASSIST PROBATION IS

09:40:59.991 --> 09:41:02.360
ALREADY FREELY GIVEN TO CBOS,

09:41:02.427 --> 09:41:03.995
FBO, FBO, FAITH BASED

09:41:04.062 --> 09:41:05.230
ORGANIZATION, AND OTHER

09:41:05.297 --> 09:41:07.465
ORGANIZATIONS. WE DON'T SEE ANY

09:41:07.532 --> 09:41:09.100
HINDRANCE FROM DIED COMING INTO

09:41:09.167 --> 09:41:11.002
THE INSTITUTION AND PROVIDING

09:41:11.069 --> 09:41:12.771
THOSE SERVICES, SO WE DON'T SEE

09:41:12.837 --> 09:41:14.139
WHY WE NEED TO GO AND CHANGE

09:41:14.206 --> 09:41:17.142
STATE LAWS, STATE MANDATED. AND

09:41:17.209 --> 09:41:19.678
THEN LASTLY, I'LL SAY THE IDEA

09:41:19.744 --> 09:41:22.514
THAT THE OPPOSITION HAS NOT

09:41:22.581 --> 09:41:25.350
TALKED IN GOOD FAITH TO THE

09:41:25.417 --> 09:41:27.886
AUTHOR. WE VISIT THE AUTHOR MANY

09:41:27.953 --> 09:41:29.721
TIMES. THE THIS IS NOT THE

09:41:29.788 --> 09:41:32.757
AUTHOR FIRST BILL ON ATTACK ON

09:41:32.824 --> 09:41:35.227
PROBATION. THERE'S SB 987 THAT

09:41:35.293 --> 09:41:36.861
TRIED TO MOVE OUR PRETRIAL

09:41:36.928 --> 09:41:38.530
OFFICERS UNDER JACCARD JUSTICE

09:41:38.597 --> 09:41:40.498
CARE OPPORTUNITIES DEPARTMENT,

09:41:40.565 --> 09:41:41.700
ANOTHER COUNTY DEPARTMENT THAT

09:41:41.766 --> 09:41:43.401
WAS JUST NEWLY CREATED. LET'S

09:41:43.468 --> 09:41:45.203
STICK TO THE MERITS OF THIS

09:41:45.270 --> 09:41:45.837
BILL, PLEASE, EVERYBODY. WELL,

WE WILL TAKE AS MUCH TIME AS WE

09:41:55.647 --> 09:41:56.448
NEED. BUT ALL I WOULD ASK IS,

09:41:56.514 --> 09:41:57.749
LET'S PLEASE CONFINE OUR

09:41:57.816 --> 09:41:59.050

DUPLICATING ANY EFFORTS ON

09:42:26.978 --> 09:42:28.413
QUESTIONS I MIGHT BE ASKING. I

09:42:28.480 --> 09:42:30.849
WAS LISTENING AS I WAS ON MY WAY

09:42:30.915 --> 09:42:32.217
OVER HERE, BUT MIGHT HAVE NOT

09:42:32.284 --> 09:42:33.285
HAVE UNDERSTOOD IF

09:42:33.351 --> 09:42:34.919
ACCOUNTABILITY WAS TAKEN ON ALL

09:42:34.986 --> 09:42:37.122
SIDES. THE QUESTION ABOUT THE

09:42:37.188 --> 09:42:38.423
TWO YEAR BILL, WHETHER IT'S

09:42:38.490 --> 09:42:39.924
EITHER OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE OR

09:42:39.991 --> 09:42:41.493
WHETHER IT'S ON THE FLOOR

09:42:41.559 --> 09:42:42.794
CONFIRMING WHETHER OR NOT

09:42:42.861 --> 09:42:43.962
PROBATION AND THE SENATOR WILL

09:42:44.029 --> 09:42:46.197
WORK TOGETHER, I THINK IS STILL

09:42:46.264 --> 09:42:47.799
IN QUESTION. TO PIGGYBACK ON MY

09:42:47.866 --> 09:42:49.901
COLLEAGUE, MR. NGUYEN SAID IS

09:42:49.968 --> 09:42:52.270
ABOUT PROBATION AND THE AUTHOR

09:42:52.337 --> 09:42:54.306
WORKING TOGETHER. AND SO I'M

09:42:54.372 --> 09:42:57.208
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF, IF, IF

09:42:57.275 --> 09:42:59.778
IT GETS IT OUT OF TODAY OR THIS

09:42:59.844 --> 09:43:00.845
BILL DOES NOT GET OUT OF

09:43:00.912 --> 09:43:03.081
COMMITTEE, DOES THE PROBLEM JUST

09:43:03.148 --> 09:43:04.883
FESTER AND CONTINUE? AND THAT'S

09:43:04.949 --> 09:43:07.619
GOING TO BE ON ALL OF US WHO ARE

09:43:07.686 --> 09:43:09.688
HERE TO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT. IF

09:43:09.754 --> 09:43:10.488
WE DON'T DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS

09:43:10.555 --> 09:43:12.223
TODAY, THEN THE PROBLEM GETS

09:43:12.290 --> 09:43:13.792
WORSE. AND NO, NOBODY'S FEET ARE

09:43:13.858 --> 09:43:16.695
HELD TO THE FIRE ON THAT. IF IT

09:43:16.761 --> 09:43:17.996
DOES GET OUT TODAY AND IT'S

09:43:18.063 --> 09:43:18.863
GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS THAT

09:43:18.930 --> 09:43:20.632
THE SENATOR MENTIONED AND AGREED

09:43:20.699 --> 09:43:22.334
TO, THEN PROBATION NEEDS TO TAKE

09:43:22.400 --> 09:43:24.202
THAT ACTION TO ADDRESS THESE

09:43:24.269 --> 09:43:26.404
ISSUES. DID AND PROBATION NEED

09:43:26.471 --> 09:43:27.472
TO COLLABORATE OR TRANSFER THOSE

09:43:27.539 --> 09:43:30.075
DUTIES TO DM. SOMETHING HAS TO

09:43:30.141 --> 09:43:31.609
HAPPEN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT

09:43:31.676 --> 09:43:33.611
ANSWER IS, BUT BUT SOMETHING HAS

09:43:33.678 --> 09:43:35.213
TO HAPPEN. AND SO I KNOW THAT

09:43:35.280 --> 09:43:36.781
WE'RE ALL SORT OF TALKING IN

09:43:36.848 --> 09:43:38.283
CIRCLES HERE, BUT AND I DON'T

09:43:38.350 --> 09:43:40.118
KNOW IF THE SENATOR WANTS TO

09:43:40.185 --> 09:43:42.053
ANSWER THE PIECE ON THE TWO YEAR

09:43:42.120 --> 09:43:43.021
COMPONENT, WHETHER WE KEEP IT

09:43:43.088 --> 09:43:45.190
HERE OR YOU WORK WITH EACH

09:43:45.256 --> 09:43:46.825
OTHER. BUT I JUST NEED YOU BOTH

09:43:46.891 --> 09:43:47.692
TO SAY THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO

09:43:47.759 --> 09:43:49.661
WORK TOGETHER ON THIS TO GET

09:43:49.728 --> 09:43:51.196
THIS DONE. AND IF IT'S IF THE

09:43:51.262 --> 09:43:52.163
SENATOR IS SAYING SHE'S NOT

09:43:52.230 --> 09:43:55.200
HEARD FROM YOUR FOLKS ON THIS, I

09:43:55.266 --> 09:43:57.001
WILL BELIEVE HER. BUT IF YOU'RE

09:43:57.068 --> 09:43:57.969
IF YOU'RE SAYING OTHERWISE, I

09:43:58.036 --> 09:43:59.637
DON'T KNOW. I DON'T HAVE THE

09:43:59.704 --> 09:44:01.406
PROOF TO SHOWCASE THAT. BUT I

09:44:01.473 --> 09:44:02.907
DON'T LIKE THAT WE'RE IN THIS

09:44:02.974 --> 09:44:04.776
POSITION. IF NONE OF YOU HAVE

09:44:04.843 --> 09:44:06.544
BEEN TALKING, AND THIS HAS BEEN

09:44:06.611 --> 09:44:07.245
THREE YEARS THAT SHE'S BEEN

09:44:07.312 --> 09:44:08.046
TRYING TO GET THIS ISSUE

09:44:08.113 --> 09:44:09.114
THROUGH, AND RATHER THAN THE

09:44:09.180 --> 09:44:11.683
PROBLEM GETTING FIXED, IT'S ONLY

09:44:11.750 --> 09:44:14.018
GOTTEN WORSE. SO I DON'T KNOW

09:44:14.085 --> 09:44:16.054
WHO WANTS TO RESPOND TO THE TWO

09:44:16.121 --> 09:44:17.122
YEAR COMPONENT. THAT'S UP TO

09:44:17.188 --> 09:44:18.990
YOU. OR IF MR. BYRD WANTS TO

09:44:19.057 --> 09:44:20.058
RESPOND AS WELL THROUGH THE

09:44:20.125 --> 09:44:21.926
CHAIR. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT

09:44:21.993 --> 09:44:23.962
ME TO RESPOND TO IT AGAIN, IF

09:44:24.028 --> 09:44:26.564
YOU'D LIKE. OKAY, I CAN IF YOU

09:44:26.631 --> 09:44:27.465
PREFER. YOU KNOW, AS I REMEMBER,

09:44:27.532 --> 09:44:29.768
YOU AND I SPOKE ABOUT THIS AND

09:44:29.834 --> 09:44:31.603
ACTUALLY THIS DEAL WAS MADE

09:44:31.669 --> 09:44:32.470
AFTER A CONVERSATION WITH THE

09:44:32.537 --> 09:44:35.540
ASSEMBLY MEMBER AS I NEEDED THAT

09:44:35.607 --> 09:44:37.375
THAT LAST SUPPORT TO GET IT OUT

09:44:37.442 --> 09:44:38.843
OF HERE. AND WHEN I MENTIONED TO

09:44:38.910 --> 09:44:40.612
THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS, LISTEN,

09:44:40.678 --> 09:44:43.181
I NEED IT AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE

09:44:43.248 --> 09:44:44.416
TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK AS, AS

09:44:44.482 --> 09:44:47.018
CAN BE TO ENSURE THAT SHOULD

09:44:47.085 --> 09:44:49.220
NOTHING CHANGE OUT OF THIS

09:44:49.287 --> 09:44:50.155
CONVERSATION, THAT WE CAN BE

09:44:50.221 --> 09:44:51.956
READY TO GO AND SEND IT UP. THE

09:44:52.023 --> 09:44:54.125
ASSEMBLY MEMBER SUGGESTED OTHER

09:44:54.192 --> 09:44:55.193
THINGS, LIKE A HEARING ON IT

09:44:55.260 --> 09:44:57.162
LATER IN THE FALL. AND THAT'S

09:44:57.228 --> 09:44:58.897
WHEN HE LEARNED THAT I HAD

09:44:58.963 --> 09:44:59.931
ALREADY HAD TWO INFORMATIONAL

09:44:59.998 --> 09:45:01.366
HEARINGS OUT OF THIS, THAT I'VE

09:45:01.433 --> 09:45:02.233
DONE THE DUE THE DUE DILIGENCE

09:45:02.300 --> 09:45:03.935
TO NOT JUST INTRODUCE SOMETHING

09:45:04.002 --> 09:45:06.137
TO ACTUALLY DO THE BACK END WORK

09:45:06.204 --> 09:45:07.205
BEFORE I CAME HERE. SO THAT WAS

09:45:07.272 --> 09:45:10.408
MY ASK. I WILL CONTINUE EVEN TWO

09:45:10.475 --> 09:45:12.811
DAYS AGO OR A DAY AGO. I THINK

09:45:12.877 --> 09:45:14.746
EVEN THIS MORNING WE REACHED OUT

09:45:14.813 --> 09:45:15.680
TO OPPOSITION AND SAID, HEY, WE

09:45:15.747 --> 09:45:17.182
TOOK THESE AMENDMENTS. DOES THIS

09:45:17.248 --> 09:45:18.483
HELP WITH YOUR MEMBERS? THEY

09:45:18.550 --> 09:45:20.351
SAID, NO, NOTHING. NO, THERE'S

09:45:20.418 --> 09:45:23.621
NO COLLABORATION. THERE'S NO

09:45:23.688 --> 09:45:25.190
AMENDMENTS BEING PROPOSED. I

09:45:25.256 --> 09:45:27.058
WILL LOOK AT ANY AMENDMENT. I

09:45:27.125 --> 09:45:28.493
TOOK ALL THE AMENDMENTS THAT

09:45:28.560 --> 09:45:30.195
WERE PROPOSED FROM THIS

09:45:30.261 --> 09:45:30.829
COMMITTEE. EVERY AMENDMENT THAT

09:45:30.895 --> 09:45:32.063
A COLLEAGUE HAS PROPOSED TO ME,

09:45:32.130 --> 09:45:33.631
I HAVE TAKEN IT BECAUSE THAT'S

09:45:33.698 --> 09:45:35.633
THE ONLY THOSE ARE THE ONLY

09:45:35.700 --> 09:45:37.268
PEOPLE PROVIDING AMENDMENTS TO

09:45:37.335 --> 09:45:39.204
ME. SO I AM COMMITTED. IF

09:45:39.270 --> 09:45:40.238
PROBATION HAS AMENDMENTS THEY

09:45:40.305 --> 09:45:41.940
WANT TO SEND ME THAT I CAN

09:45:42.006 --> 09:45:43.508
REVIEW, I WILL. I'VE ALREADY

09:45:43.575 --> 09:45:44.442
COMMITTED THAT I HAVE OTHER

09:45:44.509 --> 09:45:45.977
AMENDMENTS READY TO GO TO

09:45:46.044 --> 09:45:47.245
ADDRESS THE COURTS, AND I

09:45:47.312 --> 09:45:48.413
ALREADY HAVE OTHER AMENDMENTS

09:45:48.480 --> 09:45:50.014
READY TO GO TO CHANGE THIS TO

09:45:50.081 --> 09:45:51.416
SPECIFICALLY, SAY, LA COUNTY,

09:45:51.483 --> 09:45:52.650
BECAUSE SOME COUNTIES WERE

09:45:52.717 --> 09:45:54.285
WORRIED THAT THEY MIGHT GROW TO

09:45:54.352 --> 09:45:57.622
6 MILLION PEOPLE. THAT'S THAT'S

09:45:57.689 --> 09:45:59.023
THEIR I DON'T THINK THEY WILL.

09:45:59.090 --> 09:46:00.725
BUT JUST IN CASE WE'LL MAKE SURE

09:46:00.792 --> 09:46:02.927
IT'S LA COUNTY. SO I HAVE I WILL

09:46:02.994 --> 09:46:04.329
CONTINUE TO MAKE THAT

09:46:04.395 --> 09:46:06.164
COMMITMENT. AND WITH THAT

09:46:06.231 --> 09:46:07.999
COMMITMENT AND IT GOES TO THE

09:46:08.066 --> 09:46:09.467
ASSEMBLY FLOOR. CORRECT. IT

09:46:09.534 --> 09:46:11.336
WOULD GO TO THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR.

09:46:11.402 --> 09:46:12.370
AND THEN THE SENATOR HAS

09:46:12.437 --> 09:46:13.872
COMMITTED TO MOVING IT TO THE

09:46:13.938 --> 09:46:15.206
INACTIVE FILE. AND THE SPEAKER'S

09:46:15.273 --> 09:46:16.374
OFFICE IS TRACKING AND WILL

09:46:16.441 --> 09:46:17.375
ENFORCE THAT COMMITMENT.

09:46:17.442 --> 09:46:18.376
CORRECT. BUT MY CONCERN IS THAT

09:46:18.443 --> 09:46:20.979
IF IT GOES TO THE FLOOR, THAT

09:46:21.045 --> 09:46:22.013
NOTHING WILL CHANGE. AND IF IT

09:46:22.080 --> 09:46:23.681
GETS TO THE FLOOR, THEN I'M NOT

09:46:23.748 --> 09:46:25.984
GOING TO VOTE FOR IT. THAT'S MY

09:46:26.050 --> 09:46:27.352
CONCERN. SO I WANT TO KNOW THAT

09:46:27.418 --> 09:46:29.053
THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME SORT OF

09:46:29.120 --> 09:46:31.055
AN AGREEMENT HERE AND NOW, MR.

09:46:31.122 --> 09:46:32.090
BYRD, THAT YOU AND MISS MENGIBAR

09:46:32.156 --> 09:46:33.691
WILL COMMIT TO WORKING TOGETHER.

09:46:33.758 --> 09:46:35.026
I'LL NOMINATE SCHULTZ TO BE

09:46:35.093 --> 09:46:35.860
THERE. AND YOU GUYS CAN FIGURE

09:46:35.927 --> 09:46:37.595
AGAIN, HOW MANY GRENADES DO I

09:46:37.662 --> 09:46:39.297
HAVE TO TAKE? MR. GONZALEZ, I

09:46:39.364 --> 09:46:41.733
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I IF I,

09:46:41.799 --> 09:46:44.736
IF I MAY CHAIR. YES, I WILL SAY

09:46:44.802 --> 09:46:47.605
THIS. WE ARE ALWAYS IN

09:46:47.672 --> 09:46:49.007
COLLABORATION WITH TRYING TO DO

09:46:49.073 --> 09:46:51.175
THINGS THAT HELP PROBATION. IT

09:46:51.242 --> 09:46:55.847
IS DIFFICULT. HONORABLE SIMPLY

09:46:55.914 --> 09:46:59.217
TO THINK THAT AN ENTITY OTHER

09:46:59.284 --> 09:47:01.219
THAN PROBATION SHOULD BE THE

09:47:01.286 --> 09:47:03.421
LEAD. WHEN THE STATE HAS

09:47:03.488 --> 09:47:04.889
MANDATED THAT IT'S PROBATION.

09:47:04.956 --> 09:47:06.758
AND SO WHAT I WILL SAY ABOUT

09:47:06.824 --> 09:47:10.295
THAT IS WE ARE WE WILL GO BACK

09:47:10.361 --> 09:47:13.531
AGAIN AND TRY TO FIND

09:47:13.598 --> 09:47:15.667
AMENDMENTS. BUT I'M MORE

09:47:15.733 --> 09:47:18.836
CONCERNED BECAUSE THIS IS PUBLIC

09:47:18.903 --> 09:47:20.838
SAFETY. THIS IS A PUBLIC SAFETY

09:47:20.905 --> 09:47:23.975
COMMITTEE. AND I SPOKE ABOUT

09:47:24.042 --> 09:47:28.012
CLARITY, AND I'M NOT CLEAR AS TO

09:47:28.079 --> 09:47:30.848
WHAT THE BILL IS GOING TO

09:47:30.915 --> 09:47:33.017
ACCOMPLISH THROUGH AN ENTITY

09:47:33.084 --> 09:47:35.019
THAT HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE LESS

09:47:35.086 --> 09:47:37.622
THAN THREE YEARS VERSUS AN

09:47:37.689 --> 09:47:40.858
ENTITY THAT HAS MADE MANY

09:47:40.925 --> 09:47:44.429
REFORMATIONS SINCE 1903. AND

09:47:44.495 --> 09:47:46.564
STILL PEOPLE HAVE DEDICATED

09:47:46.631 --> 09:47:50.568
THEIR LIVES FOR REFORMATION. WE

09:47:50.635 --> 09:47:52.403
DON'T CONTROL THE THINGS THAT

09:47:52.470 --> 09:47:55.740
THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS DOES,

09:47:55.807 --> 09:47:58.509
BUT WE ARE HERE TO WORK TO

09:47:58.576 --> 09:48:01.012
ENHANCE THE PROGRAM. I THINK

09:48:01.079 --> 09:48:03.581
FROM MY PERSONAL OPINION AND THE

09:48:03.648 --> 09:48:05.650
PEOPLE THAT I REPRESENT AND THE

09:48:05.717 --> 09:48:07.151
PEOPLE YOU KNOW, I'VE LIVED IN

09:48:07.218 --> 09:48:08.720
THREE DIFFERENT DISTRICTS IN LOS

09:48:08.786 --> 09:48:10.421
ANGELES COUNTY AND EVEN IN

09:48:10.488 --> 09:48:14.292
LAKEVIEW TERRACE. SO I THINK IF

09:48:14.359 --> 09:48:17.562
WE WOULD CONCENTRATE AND MAKE

09:48:17.629 --> 09:48:18.997
PROBATION, THE ENTITY THAT NEEDS

09:48:19.063 --> 09:48:21.899
THE REFORM, ALL THE THINGS THAT

09:48:21.966 --> 09:48:24.469
ARE ASKED FOR IN THE BILL,

09:48:24.535 --> 09:48:25.903
EXCEPT GIVING AWAY SOME OF THE

09:48:25.970 --> 09:48:27.472
RIGHTS IN TERMS OF ACCESSING

09:48:27.538 --> 09:48:28.272
RECORDS, WHICH WE THINK WILL

09:48:28.339 --> 09:48:30.508
CAUSE HARM, COULD BE ADDRESSED

09:48:30.575 --> 09:48:32.443
AS LONG AS YOU'RE ADDRESSING IT

09:48:32.510 --> 09:48:34.145
IN PROBATION. BUT IF THE AUTHOR

09:48:34.212 --> 09:48:36.180
WANTS TO MAINTAIN THAT, THEY

09:48:36.247 --> 09:48:38.383
BELIEVE THAT SOME OF OUR WORK,

09:48:38.449 --> 09:48:39.884
WHICH WE'VE ALREADY GIVEN,

09:48:39.951 --> 09:48:41.586
SHOULD BE GIVEN TO ANOTHER

09:48:41.653 --> 09:48:43.187
ENTITY, WE WILL TRY TO AMEND

09:48:43.254 --> 09:48:44.389
THAT. BUT THAT'S DIFFICULT. AND

09:48:44.455 --> 09:48:46.090
WE MADE THAT KNOWN. IT'S NOT

09:48:46.157 --> 09:48:47.525
THAT WE HAVEN'T TALKED IN GOOD

09:48:47.592 --> 09:48:49.193
FAITH. WE'VE MADE IT KNOWN WHY

09:48:49.260 --> 09:48:51.796
CERTAIN AMENDMENTS DOESN'T FIX

09:48:51.863 --> 09:48:53.965
THE BILL. IT'S HARD FINDING IT.

09:48:54.032 --> 09:48:57.035
EVEN THE AMENDMENTS YOU MADE AND

09:48:57.101 --> 09:48:59.337
PRESENTED THAT WE GOT LAST NIGHT

09:48:59.404 --> 09:49:03.141
THERE MISLEADING. IF YOU PUT IT

09:49:03.207 --> 09:49:05.443
TOWARD THE EMPHASIS OF THE BILL,

09:49:05.510 --> 09:49:06.844
THEY'RE NOT MISLEADING THAT YOU

09:49:06.911 --> 09:49:08.746
WORK TOGETHER ON THEM AND WE

09:49:08.813 --> 09:49:10.248
APPRECIATE THEM COMING UP WITH

09:49:10.314 --> 09:49:11.883
IT. BUT I THINK IT WASN'T CLEAR

09:49:11.949 --> 09:49:15.153
IN THE BILL WHAT NEEDED TO BE

09:49:15.219 --> 09:49:15.887
AMENDED RATHER THAN THE

09:49:15.953 --> 09:49:18.756
AMENDMENTS THAT WERE MADE. MR.

09:49:18.823 --> 09:49:20.825
GONZALEZ, YOU STILL HAVE THE

09:49:20.892 --> 09:49:21.959
FLOOR. I WILL JUST NOTE ASSEMBLY

09:49:22.026 --> 09:49:23.327
MEMBER NGUYEN HAS BEEN WANTING

09:49:23.394 --> 09:49:24.328
TO CHIME IN. YOU CAN CONTINUE IF

09:49:24.395 --> 09:49:27.298
YOU'RE DONE. FOR NOW, I CAN GO

09:49:27.365 --> 09:49:27.899
BACK OVER TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER

09:49:27.965 --> 09:49:30.368
NGUYEN AND GIVE YOU THE FLOOR

09:49:30.435 --> 09:49:32.003
BACK. I'M JUST TRYING TO GET

09:49:32.070 --> 09:49:33.905
CLARITY ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT.

09:49:33.971 --> 09:49:35.740
WILL YOU BE WILLING TO WORK WITH

09:49:35.807 --> 09:49:37.809
THE OFFICER? AND I KNOW THAT YOU

09:49:37.875 --> 09:49:39.243
DON'T LIKE THE DEPARTMENT, BUT

09:49:39.310 --> 09:49:40.945
OTHER WAYS TO CHANGE IT AND

09:49:41.012 --> 09:49:43.648
ADDRESS FOR THE ISSUES THAT THE

09:49:43.715 --> 09:49:44.282
MEMBER IS ADDRESSING. THERE ARE

09:49:44.348 --> 09:49:45.183
ISSUES THERE. WE CANNOT DENY

09:49:45.249 --> 09:49:46.718
THAT THOSE ARE FACTS. BUT WHAT

09:49:46.784 --> 09:49:49.220
CAN YOU DO TO GET TO A SPOT

09:49:49.287 --> 09:49:50.722
WHERE YOU AND THE SENATOR CAN

09:49:50.788 --> 09:49:52.557
MEND THIS? BECAUSE IF BOTH OF

09:49:52.623 --> 09:49:55.126
YOU CARE ABOUT THE YOUTH

09:49:55.193 --> 09:49:56.027
DEPARTMENT AND UNION JOBS AND

09:49:56.094 --> 09:49:58.362
ALL OF THOSE PIECES THAT MAKE

09:49:58.429 --> 09:49:59.764
THIS UP, THE ONLY WAY THAT THIS

09:49:59.831 --> 09:50:01.933
IS GOING TO FUNCTION IS IF YOU

09:50:01.999 --> 09:50:03.101
TWO CAN WORK TOGETHER. AND I

09:50:03.167 --> 09:50:04.202
JUST NEED THAT COMMITMENT FROM

09:50:04.268 --> 09:50:06.137
YOU ON THAT ONE. WE WILL COMMIT

09:50:06.204 --> 09:50:08.039
TO THAT. AND AGAIN, I WILL SAY

09:50:08.106 --> 09:50:10.675
TO THE COMMITTEE, YOU HAVE TO

09:50:10.742 --> 09:50:14.412
HAVE SOME REASONABLE OBJECTIVE

09:50:14.479 --> 09:50:16.647
RESULTS IN THE BILL THAT YOU

09:50:16.714 --> 09:50:19.217
WANT TO ACHIEVE. THEY ARE

09:50:19.283 --> 09:50:20.518
SUBJECTIVE AND THEREFORE YOU

09:50:20.585 --> 09:50:22.787
HAVE A PROBLEM WHEN THEY'RE

09:50:22.854 --> 09:50:24.322
SUBJECTIVE TO THE TO THE WAY

09:50:24.388 --> 09:50:26.791
IT'S WRITTEN. ALL RIGHT. MR.

09:50:26.858 --> 09:50:29.293
GONZALEZ, THANK YOU FOR YOUR

09:50:29.360 --> 09:50:30.094
LINE OF QUESTIONING. YES, I WILL

09:50:30.161 --> 09:50:31.763
TAKE THIS ASSIGNMENT AS WELL.

09:50:31.829 --> 09:50:33.231
WE'LL ALL MEET, PREFERABLY

09:50:33.297 --> 09:50:34.332
SOMEWHERE WARM AND COMFORTABLE

09:50:34.398 --> 09:50:35.366
LIKE PALM SPRINGS, AND WE'LL

09:50:35.433 --> 09:50:37.835
HASH IT OUT. VERY GOOD. I HEARD

09:50:37.902 --> 09:50:39.604
COMMITMENTS FROM BOTH ASSEMBLY

09:50:39.670 --> 09:50:41.472
MEMBER NGUYEN, PLEASE. I'M JUST

09:50:41.539 --> 09:50:43.674
GOING BACK TO THE SENATOR SAYING

09:50:43.741 --> 09:50:46.177
SHE'S WORKED ON THIS. SHE'S DONE

09:50:46.244 --> 09:50:48.346
AUTHOR AMENDMENTS AND SAID SHE'S

09:50:48.412 --> 09:50:49.781
GOT NO AMENDMENTS FROM YOU, AND

09:50:49.847 --> 09:50:51.282
YOU MIGHT HAVE ALREADY ANSWERED

09:50:51.349 --> 09:50:54.685
IT IN THE RESPONSE WITH

09:50:54.752 --> 09:50:55.920
ASSEMBLYMEMBER GONZALEZ, BUT WAS

09:50:55.987 --> 09:50:58.823
WONDERING WHY THERE HAS BEEN NO

09:50:58.890 --> 09:51:00.958
AMENDMENTS SENT TO THE SENATOR

09:51:01.025 --> 09:51:05.263
ON THIS. YOU WAS ASKING WHY NO

09:51:05.329 --> 09:51:07.398
AMENDMENTS WERE SENT? BECAUSE

09:51:07.465 --> 09:51:09.667
THE BILL I'M SORRY TO BE

09:51:09.734 --> 09:51:11.102
REDUNDANT TO A DEGREE. THAT'S

09:51:11.169 --> 09:51:13.204
WHY I SAID THE BILL WAS THE BILL

09:51:13.271 --> 09:51:16.073
IS NOT CLEAR ON ITS OBJECTIVES.

09:51:16.140 --> 09:51:18.910
THE BILL DOES NOT PRESENT

09:51:18.976 --> 09:51:21.078
ANYTHING THAT SHOWS THAT IT WILL

09:51:21.145 --> 09:51:22.847
HAVE THE RESULTS. FOR INSTANCE,

09:51:22.914 --> 09:51:24.282
THEY TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF

09:51:24.348 --> 09:51:26.384
THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED OVER

09:51:26.450 --> 09:51:27.185
THE YEARS. I WILL TELL YOU, IN

09:51:27.251 --> 09:51:29.887
THE LAST TWO WEEKS, THERE WAS A

09:51:29.954 --> 09:51:32.123
CBO THAT CAME FROM THE OUTSIDE

09:51:32.190 --> 09:51:33.324
TO WORK IN PROBATION, THAT GOT

09:51:33.391 --> 09:51:35.092
ARRESTED FOR BRINGING IN DRUGS.

09:51:35.159 --> 09:51:36.994
SO EVEN THOUGH YOU COULD BLAME

09:51:37.061 --> 09:51:39.163
OR POINT THE FINGER AT

09:51:39.230 --> 09:51:40.231
PROBATION, RIGHT, YOU COULD ALSO

09:51:40.298 --> 09:51:41.933
SEE THAT THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT

09:51:41.999 --> 09:51:43.835
THOSE THAT ARE UNTRAINED, LIKE

09:51:43.901 --> 09:51:46.037
WE ARE, HAVE THE SAME CAPABILITY

09:51:46.103 --> 09:51:48.072
OF MAKING THE SAME MISTAKES AT A

09:51:48.139 --> 09:51:53.211
HIGHER LEVEL. AND SO WE WANT THE

09:51:53.277 --> 09:51:55.980
AUTHOR TO WORK WITH PROBATION.

09:51:56.047 --> 09:51:58.482
AND SO WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY

09:51:58.549 --> 09:52:00.017
AMENDMENTS THAT WE COULD SEE

09:52:00.084 --> 09:52:02.153
THAT WOULD FIT THE WAY IT WAS

09:52:02.220 --> 09:52:04.622
PRESENTED. BUT WE WILL GO BACK

09:52:04.689 --> 09:52:06.791
AND WORK WITH THE AUTHOR. SO,

09:52:06.858 --> 09:52:08.326
MR. CHAIR, I'M SORRY I KEEP

09:52:08.392 --> 09:52:09.927
BRINGING THIS UP AGAIN BECAUSE

09:52:09.994 --> 09:52:11.629
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THERE IS A

09:52:11.696 --> 09:52:13.030
LOT OF DISCUSSION THAT NEEDS TO

09:52:13.097 --> 09:52:15.099
HAPPEN, AND IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S

09:52:15.166 --> 09:52:15.666
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AT THE

09:52:15.733 --> 09:52:17.268
TABLE. BUT I'M WONDERING, IT

09:52:17.335 --> 09:52:19.070
SOUNDS LIKE THERE MIGHT BE SOME

09:52:19.136 --> 09:52:19.637
POLICY CHANGES THAT HAPPEN

09:52:19.704 --> 09:52:20.905
THROUGH THIS DISCUSSION. SO THEN

09:52:20.972 --> 09:52:22.773
WOULD THIS THEN COME BACK TO US

09:52:22.840 --> 09:52:24.342
OR IT WOULD JUST GO STRAIGHT TO

09:52:24.408 --> 09:52:26.477
THE FLOOR IF IT MAKES IT OUT OF

09:52:26.544 --> 09:52:27.411
COMMITTEE TODAY, I'M JUST TRYING

09:52:27.478 --> 09:52:29.981
TO DECIDE ON WHETHER OR NOT WE

09:52:30.047 --> 09:52:31.282
SHOULD KEEP IT IN COMMITTEE SO

09:52:31.349 --> 09:52:32.884
THAT THE CONVERSATION CAN BE

09:52:32.950 --> 09:52:33.818
HAD, AND THEN WE BRING IT BACK

09:52:33.885 --> 09:52:35.753
SO THAT WE'RE A PART OF THIS

09:52:35.820 --> 09:52:38.122
DISCUSSION AND A PART OF MOVING

09:52:38.189 --> 09:52:38.923
THIS TO THE FLOOR. AGAIN, I GO

09:52:38.990 --> 09:52:41.292
BACK TO I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE

09:52:41.359 --> 09:52:42.393
IN MOVING THIS OUT AND THEN

09:52:42.460 --> 09:52:43.060
PUTTING THIS ALL ON OUR

09:52:43.127 --> 09:52:44.428
COLLEAGUES ON THE FLOOR. WHEN WE

09:52:44.495 --> 09:52:46.063
ARE A PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE,

09:52:46.130 --> 09:52:47.198
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO VET THESE

09:52:47.265 --> 09:52:50.134
THINGS OUT. AND IF WE'RE TAKING

09:52:50.201 --> 09:52:51.903
THIS OUT AND IT GOES TO THE

09:52:51.969 --> 09:52:53.905
FLOOR AND THEY HAVE THEIR

09:52:53.971 --> 09:52:55.473
DISCUSSIONS AND BIG CHANGES THEY

09:52:55.539 --> 09:52:57.108
HAVE, I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A

09:52:57.174 --> 09:52:59.110
POLICY CHANGE. IT WOULD COME

09:52:59.176 --> 09:53:00.745
BACK FOR US TO VOTE AND THEN IT

09:53:00.811 --> 09:53:03.347
GOES TO THE FLOOR. I'M JUST NOT

09:53:03.414 --> 09:53:03.981
QUITE SURE HOW THAT HAPPENS,

09:53:04.048 --> 09:53:05.950
WHICH IS WHY I THINK THE VOTE

09:53:06.017 --> 09:53:07.685
WOULD BE TO JUST HOLD IT HERE SO

09:53:07.752 --> 09:53:09.020
THAT BOTH SIDES CAN KIND OF

09:53:09.086 --> 09:53:10.354
FIGURE THIS OUT AND THEN BRING

09:53:10.421 --> 09:53:13.224
IT BACK AGAIN FOR US TO DISCUSS.

09:53:13.291 --> 09:53:13.791
WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

09:53:13.858 --> 09:53:14.358
ASSEMBLY MEMBER NGUYEN ALL

09:53:14.425 --> 09:53:16.060
CONSTRUE THAT AS A QUESTION TO

09:53:16.127 --> 09:53:18.329
THE CHAIR. I AM BY NO MEANS

09:53:18.396 --> 09:53:19.130
FORCING SENATOR MENGIBAR TO MOVE

09:53:19.196 --> 09:53:21.299
THIS OUT OF COMMITTEE AND GO TO

09:53:21.365 --> 09:53:23.034
THE FLOOR. SHE'S WELCOME TO KEEP

09:53:23.100 --> 09:53:24.101
IT PARKED HERE. HOWEVER, I HAVE

09:53:24.168 --> 09:53:25.069
HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS WITH

09:53:25.136 --> 09:53:26.203
THE SENATOR, AND I UNDERSTAND

09:53:26.270 --> 09:53:28.906
THE DESIRE TO MOVE IT OUT OF

09:53:28.973 --> 09:53:30.174
COMMITTEE TO ENSURE THAT THIS IS

09:53:30.241 --> 09:53:31.175
NOT AN ISSUE THAT IS NOT SPOKEN

09:53:31.242 --> 09:53:33.544
ABOUT, NOT REVISITED. AGAIN, SHE

09:53:33.611 --> 09:53:34.879
HAS TAKEN COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS,

09:53:34.946 --> 09:53:36.080
AND I WILL SAY THAT SHE HAS

09:53:36.147 --> 09:53:37.748
TAKEN EVERY SINGLE AMENDMENT,

09:53:37.815 --> 09:53:39.216
BEEN VERY COLLABORATIVE WITH OUR

09:53:39.283 --> 09:53:41.485
OFFICE IN TERMS OF PROCESS AND

09:53:41.552 --> 09:53:44.355
PROCEDURE. THIS IS JUST MY

09:53:44.422 --> 09:53:46.123
$0.02. IT SOUNDS AS IF THE

09:53:46.190 --> 09:53:47.658
SPONSOR OF THE BILL EVEN HAS

09:53:47.725 --> 09:53:49.060
SOME CONCERNS ABOUT ITS CURRENT

09:53:49.126 --> 09:53:50.194
ITERATION. OBVIOUSLY, THE

09:53:50.261 --> 09:53:51.862
SENATOR HAS ALL OF HER OPTIONS

09:53:51.929 --> 09:53:52.997
AVAILABLE TO HER IN JANUARY. IF

09:53:53.064 --> 09:53:55.633
SHE DOESN'T FEEL THAT THE

09:53:55.700 --> 09:53:56.267
CURRENT BILL IS SUFFICIENT, SHE

09:53:56.334 --> 09:53:57.401
COULD SIMPLY KEEP IT IN THE

09:53:57.468 --> 09:53:58.536
INACTIVE FILE AND NOT ADVANCE

09:53:58.602 --> 09:54:00.237
IT. IF SHE WANTS TO MAKE A

09:54:00.304 --> 09:54:02.373
CHANGE THAT MORE SATISFIES THE

09:54:02.440 --> 09:54:03.507
SPONSOR, THE COMMITTEE COULD

09:54:03.574 --> 09:54:06.377
PULL THAT BACK IN. IF SHE

09:54:06.444 --> 09:54:08.112
REACHES AN AGREEMENT WITH THE

09:54:08.179 --> 09:54:09.447
OPPOSITION TO CHANGE AGAIN

09:54:09.513 --> 09:54:11.182
SUBSTANTIALLY. WE CAN ROPE THAT

09:54:11.248 --> 09:54:13.584
BACK IN MY COMMITMENT TO BOTH

09:54:13.651 --> 09:54:15.519
SIDES, ALL SIDES IN THIS IS THAT

09:54:15.586 --> 09:54:16.787
WHETHER IT'S IN COMMITTEE OR

09:54:16.854 --> 09:54:19.623
NOT, I AND MY TEAM, WHO YOU SEE

09:54:19.690 --> 09:54:21.792
UP HERE AT THE DAIS, WE REMAIN

09:54:21.859 --> 09:54:22.893
COMMITTED TO BEING A RESOURCE

09:54:22.960 --> 09:54:24.328
FOR ALL OF YOU, TO THE EXTENT

09:54:24.395 --> 09:54:25.730
THAT WE CAN BROKER THOSE

09:54:25.796 --> 09:54:26.931
CONVERSATIONS, WE ARE MORE THAN

09:54:26.998 --> 09:54:29.467
HAPPY TO DO THAT. AT THE END OF

09:54:29.533 --> 09:54:30.101
THE DAY, I'M EXTENDING A

09:54:30.167 --> 09:54:31.602
COURTESY TO A COLLEAGUE WHO I

09:54:31.669 --> 09:54:33.137
DEEPLY RESPECT. I'M HAPPY TO GO

09:54:33.204 --> 09:54:34.071
EITHER WAY, AND IF THE

09:54:34.138 --> 09:54:35.806
PREFERENCE IS TO MOVE IT OUT OF

09:54:35.873 --> 09:54:36.941
COMMITTEE UNDERSTANDING, THEY'LL

09:54:37.008 --> 09:54:38.109
STILL BE WORK TO DO. I'M

09:54:38.175 --> 09:54:39.777
PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE WITH THAT

09:54:39.844 --> 09:54:41.946
ARRANGEMENT. I'D LIKE TO MOVE

09:54:42.013 --> 09:54:43.347
FORWARD WITH THE DEAL THAT I'VE

09:54:43.414 --> 09:54:45.416
MADE WITH THE MEMBERS, TO BE

09:54:45.483 --> 09:54:47.284
ABLE TO GET IT OUT OF COMMITTEE.

09:54:47.351 --> 09:54:48.919
PERFECT. I WAS JUST MORE SAYING

09:54:48.986 --> 09:54:49.520
THAT FOR THEATRICAL PURPOSES,

09:54:49.587 --> 09:54:52.623
BUT. SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE I.

09:54:52.690 --> 09:54:53.824
YES, I'M VERY COMFORTABLE WITH

09:54:53.891 --> 09:54:56.027
THE ARRANGEMENT, SENATOR. I JUST

09:54:56.093 --> 09:54:57.828
FELT WE NEEDED A MOMENT OF

09:54:57.895 --> 09:54:59.163
LEVITY THERE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

09:54:59.230 --> 09:55:00.831
NGUYEN, YOU STILL HAVE THE

09:55:00.898 --> 09:55:01.766
FLOOR. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS,

09:55:01.832 --> 09:55:03.968
COMMENTS? COFFEE ORDERS? THINK

09:55:04.035 --> 09:55:06.570
STARBUCKS MIGHT STILL BE OPEN?

09:55:06.637 --> 09:55:07.571
WELL, WE DON'T EVEN HAVE A

09:55:07.638 --> 09:55:09.040
MOTION. ACTUALLY, WE DO HAVE A

09:55:09.106 --> 09:55:10.841
MOTION. I'M SORRY. WE HAVE A WE

09:55:10.908 --> 09:55:13.911
NEED A SECOND. IS THERE A SECOND

09:55:13.978 --> 09:55:16.847
I OKAY, MR. HANEY, WE HAVE A

09:55:16.914 --> 09:55:19.617
SECOND. THEN WITH THAT, SENATOR

09:55:19.683 --> 09:55:20.184
MENGIBAR, YOU'RE WELCOME TO

09:55:20.251 --> 09:55:25.056
CLOSE IF YOU'D LIKE. OKAY. I DO

09:55:25.122 --> 09:55:28.526
APPRECIATE THE TIME THAT WAS

09:55:28.592 --> 09:55:31.295
SPENT BY EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU

09:55:31.362 --> 09:55:31.929
ON THIS, BECAUSE IT ALLOWED THE

09:55:31.996 --> 09:55:34.432
DISCUSSION TO COME TO LIGHT.

09:55:34.498 --> 09:55:37.501
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS DON'T FORCE

09:55:37.568 --> 09:55:39.970
ANYBODY TO RAPE, LEAD FIGHT

09:55:40.037 --> 09:55:42.139
CLUBS, OR CALL OUT AND NOT

09:55:42.206 --> 09:55:44.608
REPORT TO WORK. THAT IS BY THE

09:55:44.675 --> 09:55:46.844
INDIVIDUAL. AND RIGHT NOW, AS WE

09:55:46.911 --> 09:55:48.612
WERE TALKING RIGHT NOW, I GOT A

09:55:48.679 --> 09:55:51.415
PING THAT A KID RIGHT NOW JUST

09:55:51.482 --> 09:55:53.651
OD'D FROM LOS PADRINOS IN L.A.

09:55:53.717 --> 09:55:56.887
COUNTY. AGAIN SURVIVED. BUT ON

09:55:56.954 --> 09:55:58.355
THE WAY TO THE HOSPITAL AS WE

09:55:58.422 --> 09:56:00.291
WERE TALKING, ANOTHER INCIDENT

09:56:00.357 --> 09:56:02.860
IN L.A. COUNTY BECAUSE LIKE LA

09:56:02.927 --> 09:56:04.795
TIMES WILL SHOW THAT ON ONE

09:56:04.862 --> 09:56:07.298
NIGHT WHEN A YOUTH ESCAPED, 100

09:56:07.364 --> 09:56:08.999
PROBATION OFFICERS WERE

09:56:09.066 --> 09:56:10.868
SCHEDULED TO WORK, BUT 60 CALLED

09:56:10.935 --> 09:56:14.538
OUT. ON ANOTHER DAY, 103

09:56:14.605 --> 09:56:15.506
PROBATION OFFICERS CALLED OUT.

09:56:15.573 --> 09:56:18.476
THE NEXT DAY, 101 OFFICERS

09:56:18.542 --> 09:56:20.945
CALLED OUT. YOU HEARD FOR THE

09:56:21.011 --> 09:56:21.579
OPPOSITION. THEY'RE STRUGGLING

09:56:21.645 --> 09:56:23.481
WITH STAFFING. THEY ARE

09:56:23.547 --> 09:56:24.882
STRUGGLING WITH STAFFING. THEY

09:56:24.949 --> 09:56:27.485
NEED SUPPORT. THE SUPPORT IS

09:56:27.551 --> 09:56:28.919
WITH THE COUNTY HAVING THE

09:56:28.986 --> 09:56:31.388
ABILITY TO BRING IN ADDITIONAL

09:56:31.455 --> 09:56:32.790
ENTITIES THAT PROBATION CANNOT

09:56:32.857 --> 09:56:36.760
DENY ENTRY TO. I HAVE A MILITARY

09:56:36.827 --> 09:56:38.062
BACKGROUND. I HAVE APPLIED TO BE

09:56:38.129 --> 09:56:39.530
A LAW ENFORCEMENT IN ANOTHER

09:56:39.597 --> 09:56:41.365
WORLD. I WOULD HAVE BEEN A COP.

09:56:41.432 --> 09:56:43.267
I HAVE HIGH ESTEEM FOR ANYBODY

09:56:43.334 --> 09:56:45.469
WHO WEARS A UNIFORM. THIS IS NOT

09:56:45.536 --> 09:56:47.671
THE AUTHOR THAT IS COMING IN TO

09:56:47.738 --> 09:56:49.507
SAY, I DON'T WANT COPS PROBATION

09:56:49.573 --> 09:56:51.208
OFFICERS TO EXIST IN THESE

09:56:51.275 --> 09:56:53.010
ROLES. I THINK THEY HAVE TO

09:56:53.077 --> 09:56:54.578
EXIST IN THESE ROLES. BUT I'M

09:56:54.645 --> 09:56:55.980
ALSO A SOCIAL WORKER AND THAT IS

09:56:56.046 --> 09:56:58.048
MY ACADEMIC BACKGROUND. I

09:56:58.115 --> 09:56:59.483
RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN

09:56:59.550 --> 09:57:02.019
INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE A BETTER

09:57:02.086 --> 09:57:03.387
POSITION TO BRING SOCIAL

09:57:03.454 --> 09:57:05.556
SERVICES TO OUR YOUTH IN

09:57:05.623 --> 09:57:06.790
CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN MOVING

09:57:06.857 --> 09:57:09.960
TOWARDS A MODEL TO BE MORE

09:57:10.027 --> 09:57:12.029
REHABILITATIVE OF BOTH OUR YOUTH

09:57:12.096 --> 09:57:13.931
AND OUR ADULTS AND OUR

09:57:13.998 --> 09:57:15.699
INCARCERATED SYSTEM. THIS BILL

09:57:15.766 --> 09:57:17.501
DOES NOT SHORTEN THE TIME

09:57:17.568 --> 09:57:19.603
ALLOTTED FOR KIDS TO BE IN

09:57:19.670 --> 09:57:20.838
JUVENILE HALLS. THIS BILL DOES

09:57:20.905 --> 09:57:23.340
NOT SAY THAT WE NEED TO RELEASE

09:57:23.407 --> 09:57:24.341
INDIVIDUALS OUT INTO THE

09:57:24.408 --> 09:57:25.843
COMMUNITY. IT DOES NOT SAY THAT

09:57:25.910 --> 09:57:27.912
THESE KIDS ARE STILL GOING TO BE

09:57:27.978 --> 09:57:29.813
ABLE TO SERVE THEIR TIME IN

09:57:29.880 --> 09:57:30.948
JUVENILE HALLS. IT JUST SAYS

09:57:31.015 --> 09:57:31.982
THAT SERVICES ARE GOING TO

09:57:32.049 --> 09:57:33.417
HAPPEN BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE

09:57:33.484 --> 09:57:35.186
ADDITIONAL SUPPORT BY A

09:57:35.252 --> 09:57:37.655
DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT. I AM

09:57:37.721 --> 09:57:39.557
COMMITTED TO STILL WORKING WITH

09:57:39.623 --> 09:57:41.625
THE OPPOSITION. BUT TO SENATOR

09:57:41.692 --> 09:57:43.661
WYNN'S POINT, I HAVE HERE

09:57:43.727 --> 09:57:45.262
VERBATIM AN EMAIL FROM THE

09:57:45.329 --> 09:57:46.330
OPPOSITION THAT SAYS ON BEHALF

09:57:46.397 --> 09:57:48.032
OF THE COALITION OF LA PROBATION

09:57:48.098 --> 09:57:50.234
UNIONS, WE BELIEVE THAT NO

09:57:50.301 --> 09:57:52.169
AMENDMENT CAN FIX A BILL THAT IS

09:57:52.236 --> 09:57:53.204
FUNDAMENTALLY DESIGNED TO

09:57:53.270 --> 09:57:55.005
DISMANTLE A UNION WORKFORCE. THE

09:57:55.072 --> 09:57:56.907
AMENDMENTS I TOOK FROM COMMITTEE

09:57:56.974 --> 09:57:59.276
DOUBLE DOWN AND SAY THAT NO

09:57:59.343 --> 09:58:01.345
UNION JOBS WILL BE LOST, AND

09:58:01.412 --> 09:58:03.681
WHATEVER JOB IS CREATED HERE HAS

09:58:03.747 --> 09:58:06.116
TO GO TO A UNION. SO I'VE BEEN

09:58:06.183 --> 09:58:07.585
TRYING AND I WILL CONTINUE TO

09:58:07.651 --> 09:58:09.320
COMMIT TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION,

09:58:09.386 --> 09:58:11.088
BUT I'M JUST POINTING THAT OUT

09:58:11.155 --> 09:58:14.325
THAT NO, IT'S I'M JUST POINTING

09:58:14.391 --> 09:58:17.561
THAT OUT. COMMITTEE MEMBERS, I

09:58:17.628 --> 09:58:21.265
KNOW IT'S NOT IDEAL WHAT WHAT

09:58:21.332 --> 09:58:24.068
WE'RE DOING HERE TO PARKING IN

09:58:24.134 --> 09:58:26.303
THE ON THE FLOOR. BUT I NEED

09:58:26.370 --> 09:58:27.571
SOME LEVERAGE AND I'M SHOWING

09:58:27.638 --> 09:58:29.073
ALL MY CARDS HERE. YOU HAVE ALL

09:58:29.139 --> 09:58:31.575
MY CARDS HERE THAT I NEED SOME

09:58:31.642 --> 09:58:32.710
LEVERAGE TO ALLOW L'APPROBATION

09:58:32.776 --> 09:58:33.877
TO TAKE US SERIOUSLY. THAT'S

09:58:33.944 --> 09:58:35.246
SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN

09:58:35.312 --> 09:58:36.380
AND SOMETHING NEEDS TO CHANGE

09:58:36.447 --> 09:58:38.148
WITH YOUR SUPPORT, AS THIS ONLY

09:58:38.215 --> 09:58:40.384
APPLIES TO L.A. COUNTY, L.A.

09:58:40.451 --> 09:58:42.486
COUNTY ONLY. I NEED YOUR SUPPORT

09:58:42.553 --> 09:58:44.154
TO GET THAT TO THE FLOOR TO

09:58:44.221 --> 09:58:45.189
CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS

09:58:45.256 --> 09:58:46.490
WITH THAT, MR. CHAIR, ASKING

09:58:46.557 --> 09:58:48.926
RESPECTFULLY FOR AN AYE VOTE.

09:58:48.993 --> 09:58:52.196
THANK YOU. SENATOR, I HAVE A

09:58:52.263 --> 09:58:53.998
BRIEF, RELATIVELY BRIEF

09:58:54.064 --> 09:58:55.332
RECOMMENDATION. COLLEAGUES, I AM

09:58:55.399 --> 09:58:56.634
RECOMMENDING AN AYE. AND I'M

09:58:56.700 --> 09:58:57.935
GOING TO START WITH THE

09:58:58.002 --> 09:58:59.436
PROCEDURAL POINT HERE. PART OF

09:58:59.503 --> 09:59:01.905
WHY I SUPPORT SENATOR MENGIBAR

09:59:01.972 --> 09:59:03.274
MOVING IT OUT OF COMMITTEE INTO

09:59:03.340 --> 09:59:05.175
THE FLOOR IS QUITE SIMPLY THE

09:59:05.242 --> 09:59:06.243
TIMING. IF SENATOR WERE TO HOLD

09:59:06.310 --> 09:59:08.879
IT AS A TWO YEAR BILL IN THIS

09:59:08.946 --> 09:59:09.913
COMMITTEE, AS YOU ALL KNOW, SHE

09:59:09.980 --> 09:59:11.682
WOULD ONLY HAVE UNTIL JANUARY TO

09:59:11.749 --> 09:59:13.817
TRY TO WORK OUT ALL OF THESE

09:59:13.884 --> 09:59:14.885
LOGISTICS WITH THE OPPOSITION.

09:59:14.952 --> 09:59:16.020
MOVING IT TO THE FLOOR GIVES HER

09:59:16.086 --> 09:59:18.022
ALL OF NEXT YEAR AND ALL OF NEXT

09:59:18.088 --> 09:59:19.156
SESSION TO HOPEFULLY HAVE A

09:59:19.223 --> 09:59:20.391
CHANCE TO CONTINUE THIS THIS

09:59:20.457 --> 09:59:21.492
CONVERSATION. AND I HOPE AND

09:59:21.558 --> 09:59:23.127
BELIEVE THAT THERE IS COMMON

09:59:23.193 --> 09:59:25.062
GROUND TO BE FOUND HERE. I MIGHT

09:59:25.129 --> 09:59:26.096
BE NAIVE, BUT I GENUINELY DO. I

09:59:26.163 --> 09:59:27.731
AM BETTING ON SENATOR MENGIBAR,

09:59:27.798 --> 09:59:29.033
AND I'M AFFORDING HER THE TIME

09:59:29.099 --> 09:59:31.402
THAT I BELIEVE THAT SHE NEEDS TO

09:59:31.468 --> 09:59:32.069
HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AND FIND

09:59:32.136 --> 09:59:33.971
COMMON GROUND. IF YOU AGREE WITH

09:59:34.038 --> 09:59:35.172
THAT, I WOULD STRONGLY ENCOURAGE

09:59:35.239 --> 09:59:37.107
YOU TO VOTE AYE. AND THE LAST

09:59:37.174 --> 09:59:39.710
THING I WILL MENTION IS THIS I

09:59:39.777 --> 09:59:41.378
UNDERSTAND, I GENUINELY DO. I

09:59:41.445 --> 09:59:42.980
UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO AN

09:59:43.047 --> 09:59:44.581
EXTENT WITH MANY OF THE CONCERNS

09:59:44.648 --> 09:59:46.283
RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION. I WILL

09:59:46.350 --> 09:59:48.385
SIMPLY CLOSE WITH NOTING THAT

09:59:48.452 --> 09:59:50.587
THE GENTLEMAN, MR. BYRD, WHO WAS

09:59:50.654 --> 09:59:51.655
SITTING THERE IN THE CHAIR, I

09:59:51.722 --> 09:59:53.757
THINK HE'S NOW BACK OVER THERE.

09:59:53.824 --> 09:59:54.358
THERE WAS A GOOD POINT ABOUT

09:59:54.425 --> 09:59:55.893
WHAT IS THIS BILL TRYING TO

09:59:55.959 --> 09:59:58.329
SOLVE MY HUMBLE PERSPECTIVE AS

09:59:58.395 --> 10:00:00.164
CHAIR. IT STARTS RIGHT HERE ON

10:00:00.230 --> 10:00:01.965
PAGE THREE OF THE COMMITTEE

10:00:02.032 --> 10:00:03.901
ANALYSIS FROM PAGES THREE

10:00:03.967 --> 10:00:05.936
THROUGH FIVE, THERE IS A SUMMARY

10:00:06.003 --> 10:00:07.738
THAT DOCUMENTS THE HORROR STORY

10:00:07.805 --> 10:00:09.206
THAT IS LOS ANGELES COUNTY

10:00:09.273 --> 10:00:10.641
PROBATION. AND I DON'T SAY THAT

10:00:10.708 --> 10:00:11.709
POINTING FINGERS. I'M NOT SAYING

10:00:11.775 --> 10:00:12.876
IT'S THE PROBATION OFFICER'S

10:00:12.943 --> 10:00:14.178
FAULT. I'M NOT SAYING IT'S THE

10:00:14.244 --> 10:00:15.679
IT'S THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS

10:00:15.746 --> 10:00:17.247
FAULT. THE POINT IS, IS THAT'S

10:00:17.314 --> 10:00:19.683
NOT FOR ME TO SAY, BUT THAT IS

10:00:19.750 --> 10:00:20.851
THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

10:00:20.918 --> 10:00:22.486
SOLVE. SENATOR MENGIBAR HAS HER

10:00:22.553 --> 10:00:23.654
PROPOSAL. I CHALLENGE THE

10:00:23.721 --> 10:00:25.422
OPPOSITION. I CHALLENGE SENATOR

10:00:25.489 --> 10:00:26.757
MENGIBAR. I CHALLENGE ALL OF US

10:00:26.824 --> 10:00:28.392
TO THINK OF A BETTER PROPOSAL.

10:00:28.459 --> 10:00:30.828
AND I'M WILLING TO BET ON

10:00:30.894 --> 10:00:31.562
SENATOR SENATOR MENGIBAR AND

10:00:31.628 --> 10:00:33.597
GIVE HER TIME TO GET THIS DONE.

10:00:33.664 --> 10:00:35.032
RIGHT. BECAUSE THE DEFINITION OF

10:00:35.099 --> 10:00:36.900
INSANITY IS DOING THE SAME THING

10:00:36.967 --> 10:00:39.269
YOU HAVE BEEN DOING, AND NOTHING

10:00:39.336 --> 10:00:40.104
EVER CHANGES. WE'RE LOSING LIVES

10:00:40.170 --> 10:00:41.972
IN LA COUNTY AND WE HAVE GOT TO

10:00:42.039 --> 10:00:44.241
DO BETTER. SO I'M WILLING TO TRY

10:00:44.308 --> 10:00:45.542
SOMETHING NEW. WITH THAT SAID,

10:00:45.609 --> 10:00:47.544
THE RECOMMENDATION IS AN AYE. WE

10:00:47.611 --> 10:00:50.447
HAVE A MOTION. WE HAVE A SECOND.

10:00:50.514 --> 10:00:51.982
LET'S CALL THE ROLL ON SB 357 BY

NGUYEN. NGUYEN. NOT VOTING.

10:01:06.430 --> 10:01:11.235

WE'RE NOT TAKING ANY ACTION ON

10:01:43.267 --> 10:01:45.002
THE BILL TODAY, BUT WE WILL BE

10:01:45.068 --> 10:01:47.037
MAKING IT A TWO YEAR BILL. AND I

10:01:47.104 --> 10:01:49.039
WOULD LIKE TO EVIDENCE MY INTENT

10:01:49.106 --> 10:01:51.041

ENERGY IS A LITTLE LOW. BUT

THANK YOU, THANK YOU. I KNOW

10:02:32.282 --> 10:02:33.984

ADVOCATE. AS I SHARED MANY TIMES

HOW IMPORTANT ADVOCACY FOR

VICTIMS IS. I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW

10:02:49.967 --> 10:02:51.602
IT IS CRITICAL TO SAFEGUARD

10:02:51.668 --> 10:02:54.104
THESE SPACES WHERE OUR VICTIMS

10:02:54.171 --> 10:02:57.040
GO. AND I WANT TO JUST SHARE

10:02:57.107 --> 10:02:57.908
THAT AREAS LIKE DOMESTIC

PEOPLE JUST ARE HAVING A HARD

10:03:14.391 --> 10:03:15.726
TIME SEEKING HELP BECAUSE THEY

10:03:15.792 --> 10:03:17.327
ARE AFRAID. AND SO THIS BILL

10:03:17.394 --> 10:03:19.796
JUST SIMPLY SAYS THAT WE WANT TO

10:03:19.863 --> 10:03:22.466
GO BACK TO A TIME WHERE WE USED

10:03:22.533 --> 10:03:24.635
TO HAVE PEOPLE PRESENT

10:03:35.245 --> 10:03:37.714
OUR VICTIMS TO FEEL SAFE, TO GO

10:03:37.781 --> 10:03:40.117
GET HELP. AND IN THE INTEREST OF

10:03:40.183 --> 10:03:42.052

VIOLENCE THAT THEY'VE BEEN

10:04:04.675 --> 10:04:06.076
REFERRED TO US BY RAPE CRISIS

10:04:06.143 --> 10:04:08.812
CENTER STAFF SINCE JANUARY 2025,

10:04:08.879 --> 10:04:10.414
WE HAVE SEEN A DECLINE IN

10:04:10.480 --> 10:04:11.915
SURVIVORS SHOWING UP TO ACCESS

10:04:11.982 --> 10:04:13.517

JUSTICE CENTERS AND OTHER

10:04:20.557 --> 10:04:22.225
PROGRAMS. DUE TO FEAR OF

10:04:22.292 --> 10:04:23.226
INCREASED IMMIGRATION

10:04:23.293 --> 10:04:24.428
ENFORCEMENT PRESENCE ACROSS THE

10:04:24.494 --> 10:04:26.930
STATE. SB 841, AUTHORED BY

10:04:26.997 --> 10:04:28.432
SENATOR RUBIO, WORKS TO ADDRESS

10:04:28.498 --> 10:04:30.334
THIS BY REQUIRING EMPLOYEES AT

10:04:30.400 --> 10:04:32.736
THESE CENTERS TO REFUSE ACCESS

10:04:32.803 --> 10:04:33.870
TO NONPUBLIC AREAS FOR

10:04:33.937 --> 10:04:35.238
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT

10:04:35.305 --> 10:04:36.807
ACTIVITY. WE KNOW THE MAJORITY

10:04:36.873 --> 10:04:38.809
OF SURVIVORS DON'T REACH OUT FOR

10:04:38.875 --> 10:04:40.444
HELP, AND THE RECENT POLITICAL

10:04:40.510 --> 10:04:42.079
CLIMATE HAS FURTHER SILENCED

10:04:42.145 --> 10:04:44.281
MANY IMMIGRANT AND UNDOCUMENTED

10:04:44.348 --> 10:04:45.682
SURVIVORS, LEAVING THEM WITHOUT

10:04:45.749 --> 10:04:47.117
ACCESS TO HEALING, SUPPORTIVE

10:04:47.184 --> 10:04:49.353
AND SAFE SERVICES. LAST MONTH,

10:04:49.419 --> 10:04:51.088
WE SAW IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT

10:04:51.154 --> 10:04:53.223
SWEEP LOS ANGELES, GRABBING

10:04:53.290 --> 10:04:54.658
INDIVIDUALS OFF THE STEPS OF

10:04:54.725 --> 10:04:56.493
COURTHOUSES AND PULLING FAMILIES

10:04:56.560 --> 10:04:58.028
APART. ONE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

10:04:58.095 --> 10:04:59.396
PROGRAM IN LA SHARED THAT A

10:04:59.463 --> 10:05:00.864
SURVIVOR THEY HAD BEEN WORKING

10:05:00.931 --> 10:05:02.232
WITH FOR SEVERAL MONTHS DID NOT

10:05:02.299 --> 10:05:03.900
APPEAR FOR HER RESTRAINING ORDER

10:05:03.967 --> 10:05:05.302
HEARING OUT OF FEAR OF INCREASED

10:05:05.369 --> 10:05:08.071
ICE PRESENCE. OTHER ADVOCATES IN

10:05:08.138 --> 10:05:09.106
RIVERSIDE COUNTY WHO WORK WITH

10:05:09.172 --> 10:05:11.041
RURAL FARM WORKER SURVIVORS

10:05:11.108 --> 10:05:12.676
SHARED THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE

10:05:12.743 --> 10:05:13.877
INCREASINGLY UNWILLING TO MEET

10:05:13.944 --> 10:05:15.879
AT THEIR PROGRAMS AND LIBRARIES,

10:05:15.946 --> 10:05:17.881
OR EVEN THE LOCAL FAMILY JUSTICE

10:05:17.948 --> 10:05:18.849
CENTER, TO TALK THROUGH

10:05:18.915 --> 10:05:20.717
RESOURCES AND SUPPORT. MANY ARE

10:05:20.784 --> 10:05:22.386
NOT EVEN LEAVING THEIR HOMES OUT

10:05:22.452 --> 10:05:24.187
OF FEAR. FOR MANY SURVIVORS,

10:05:24.254 --> 10:05:25.555
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT ACTS AS

10:05:25.622 --> 10:05:27.891
A SECOND ABUSER, SILENCING THEM

10:05:27.958 --> 10:05:29.626
AND KEEPING THEM IN HARM'S WAY.

10:05:29.693 --> 10:05:31.495
AT A TIME WHEN SURVIVORS OF

10:05:31.561 --> 10:05:33.096
CRIME NEED ACCESS TO SERVICES

10:05:33.163 --> 10:05:34.765
THE MOST, OUR PROGRAMS ARE

10:05:34.831 --> 10:05:36.033
SEEING LESS FOLKS WALK THROUGH

10:05:36.099 --> 10:05:38.468
THEIR DOORS. SB 841 ENSURES THAT

10:05:38.535 --> 10:05:40.871
THESE PROGRAMS CAN CREATE SAFE

10:05:40.937 --> 10:05:42.172
ENVIRONMENTS TO FOSTER HEALING

10:05:42.239 --> 10:05:44.341
AND SAFETY. SURVIVORS WILL NOT

10:05:44.408 --> 10:05:46.143
HAVE TO FEAR THAT IMMIGRATION

10:05:46.209 --> 10:05:48.011
AUTHORITIES AND UNLAWFUL WILL

10:05:48.078 --> 10:05:50.080
UNLAWFULLY ENTER FACILITIES, AND

10:05:50.147 --> 10:05:51.214
STAFF WILL KNOW THAT THEY CAN

10:05:51.281 --> 10:05:53.483
CONTINUE DOING WHAT THEY DO

10:05:53.550 --> 10:05:56.586
BEST. SUPPORTING SURVIVORS. I

10:05:56.653 --> 10:05:57.954
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

10:05:58.021 --> 10:05:59.890
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. GOOD

10:05:59.956 --> 10:06:01.358
EVENING. THANK YOU FOR THE

10:06:01.425 --> 10:06:02.025
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE TODAY

10:06:02.092 --> 10:06:04.461
IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB 841. MY

10:06:04.528 --> 10:06:06.396
NAME IS PERLA FLORES, AND I'VE

10:06:06.463 --> 10:06:07.431
HAD THE PRIVILEGE AND HONOR TO

10:06:07.497 --> 10:06:08.832
WORK WITH IMMIGRANT SURVIVORS OF

10:06:08.899 --> 10:06:09.499
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, SEXUAL

10:06:09.566 --> 10:06:11.435
ASSAULT, AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING

10:06:11.501 --> 10:06:13.603
FOR OVER 20 YEARS. CURRENTLY, I

10:06:13.670 --> 10:06:15.072
OVERSEE SERVICES FOR GENDER

10:06:15.138 --> 10:06:17.074
BASED VIOLENCE SURVIVORS AT

10:06:17.140 --> 10:06:18.141
COMMUNITY SOLUTIONS, A

10:06:18.208 --> 10:06:19.643
COMPREHENSIVE NONPROFIT THAT

10:06:19.710 --> 10:06:20.777
SERVES SANTA CLARA AND SAN

10:06:20.844 --> 10:06:22.779
BENITO COUNTY. IN ADDITION TO MY

10:06:22.846 --> 10:06:24.448
OWN PROGRAM LEADERSHIP, I'M ALSO

10:06:24.514 --> 10:06:26.183
AN IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY AND

10:06:26.249 --> 10:06:27.250
REPRESENTED MANY SURVIVORS OF

10:06:27.317 --> 10:06:28.885
GENDER BASED VIOLENCE AND

10:06:28.952 --> 10:06:30.387
INDIVIDUALS PURSUING IMMIGRATION

10:06:30.454 --> 10:06:32.622
RELIEF. AND LASTLY, I'M A PROUD

10:06:32.689 --> 10:06:33.990
IMMIGRANT AND ALSO A SURVIVOR OF

10:06:34.057 --> 10:06:36.359
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. I WANT TO

10:06:36.426 --> 10:06:37.694
FOCUS MY TESTIMONY ON THREE

10:06:37.761 --> 10:06:39.596
CRITICAL POINTS ONE, THE NEED TO

10:06:39.663 --> 10:06:40.864
PROTECT SURVIVORS AND THEIR

10:06:40.931 --> 10:06:42.399
CHILDREN AS THEY RECEIVE

10:06:42.466 --> 10:06:44.134
SERVICES TWO THE DEVASTATING

10:06:44.201 --> 10:06:45.402
IMPACT OF CHRONIC FEAR AND

10:06:45.469 --> 10:06:47.037
STRESS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

10:06:47.104 --> 10:06:48.872
CONSTANT THREAT OF IMMIGRATION

10:06:48.939 --> 10:06:50.307
ENFORCEMENT, AND THREE, THE

10:06:50.373 --> 10:06:51.508
EROSION OF DUE PROCESS FOR MOST

10:06:51.575 --> 10:06:53.844
OF OUR VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES.

10:06:53.910 --> 10:06:55.245
FIRSTLY, SHELTERS, CRISIS

10:06:55.312 --> 10:06:56.780
CENTERS AND OTHER SAFE SPACES

10:06:56.847 --> 10:06:58.915
ARE OFTEN THE ONLY LIFELINE

10:06:58.982 --> 10:07:00.383
AVAILABLE FOR SURVIVORS FLEEING

10:07:00.450 --> 10:07:02.185
VIOLENCE. THESE ARE PLACES WHERE

10:07:02.252 --> 10:07:04.221
SURVIVORS BEGIN TO HEAL, REGAIN

10:07:04.287 --> 10:07:05.689
STABILITY, AND ACCESS VITAL

10:07:05.756 --> 10:07:06.823
SUPPORTS FOR THEMSELVES AND

10:07:06.890 --> 10:07:08.625
THEIR CHILDREN. WHEN THESE

10:07:08.692 --> 10:07:10.060
SPACES ARE NO LONGER CONSIDERED

10:07:10.127 --> 10:07:11.895
SAFE. WHEN THE LOOMING THREAT OF

10:07:11.962 --> 10:07:12.963
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT BECOMES

10:07:13.029 --> 10:07:15.265
PART OF THE EQUATION, SURVIVORS

10:07:15.332 --> 10:07:17.901
MAY HAVE TO CHOOSE TO STAY IN

10:07:17.968 --> 10:07:19.136
DANGEROUS SITUATIONS RATHER THAN

10:07:19.202 --> 10:07:20.937
RISKS SEEKING HELP DUE TO THE

10:07:21.004 --> 10:07:24.141
FEAR THAT IF THEY DO LEAVE THE

10:07:24.207 --> 10:07:25.509
SITUATION ABUSIVE OR

10:07:25.575 --> 10:07:26.676
EXPLOITATIVE, THEY COULD BE

10:07:26.743 --> 10:07:27.577
SEPARATED FROM THEIR FAMILIES,

10:07:27.644 --> 10:07:29.112
FROM THEIR CHILDREN, OR EVEN

10:07:29.179 --> 10:07:30.881
FROM THEIR SUPPORT NETWORKS. AND

10:07:30.947 --> 10:07:32.682
THIS IS A CHOICE THAT NOBODY

10:07:32.749 --> 10:07:34.851
SHOULD HAVE TO MAKE. SECOND, THE

10:07:34.918 --> 10:07:36.386
CHRONIC STRESS AND FEAR CAUSED

10:07:36.453 --> 10:07:38.121
BY POTENTIAL IMMIGRATION

10:07:38.188 --> 10:07:39.923
ENFORCEMENT IN OR NEAR SERVICE

10:07:39.990 --> 10:07:41.391
LOCATIONS CAN HAVE SEVERE LONG

10:07:41.458 --> 10:07:43.226
TERM IMPACTS ON SURVIVORS AND

10:07:43.293 --> 10:07:44.561
THEIR CHILDREN. LIVING IN

10:07:44.628 --> 10:07:45.729
CONSTANT FEAR NOT ONLY

10:07:45.796 --> 10:07:47.164
UNDERMINES SURVIVORS ABILITY TO

10:07:47.230 --> 10:07:48.865
RECOVER EMOTIONALLY, BUT IT ALSO

10:07:48.932 --> 10:07:50.267
AFFECTS THEIR PHYSICAL HEALTH,

10:07:50.333 --> 10:07:52.269
THEIR PARENTING CAPACITY, AND

10:07:52.335 --> 10:07:53.570
CHILDREN'S DEVELOPMENT. WE'VE

10:07:53.637 --> 10:07:55.071
SEEN CHILDREN WHOSE TRAUMA IS

10:07:55.138 --> 10:07:56.039
COMPOUNDED BY WATCHING THEIR

10:07:56.106 --> 10:07:57.874
PARENTS LIVE IN FEAR, TERRIFIED

10:07:57.941 --> 10:07:59.709
THAT A KNOCK AT THE DOOR COULD

10:07:59.776 --> 10:08:01.144
MEAN SEPARATION OR DETENTION.

10:08:01.211 --> 10:08:02.612
THESE FAMILIES ARE ALREADY

10:08:02.679 --> 10:08:04.514
COPING WITH COMPLEX TRAUMA, AND

10:08:04.581 --> 10:08:05.849
ADDING THE FEAR OF IMMIGRATION

10:08:05.916 --> 10:08:07.017
ENFORCEMENT ONLY MAKES HEALING

10:08:07.083 --> 10:08:09.052
HARDER AND IN SOME CASES,

10:08:09.119 --> 10:08:10.854
IMPOSSIBLE. AND LASTLY, WE CAN'T

10:08:10.921 --> 10:08:12.689
IGNORE THE EROSION OF DUE

10:08:12.756 --> 10:08:14.124
PROCESS THAT OCCURS WHEN

10:08:14.191 --> 10:08:14.891
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT TAKES

10:08:14.958 --> 10:08:16.226
PLACE IN THESE SPACES. WITHOUT

10:08:16.293 --> 10:08:19.563
PROPER JUDICIAL OVERSIGHT. SB

10:08:19.629 --> 10:08:20.530
841 DOES NOT PREVENT LAW

10:08:20.597 --> 10:08:21.698
ENFORCEMENT FROM DOING THEIR

10:08:21.765 --> 10:08:23.500
JOB. IT SIMPLY ENSURES THE BASIC

10:08:23.567 --> 10:08:25.335
LEGAL STANDARDS ARE MET. IT

10:08:25.402 --> 10:08:26.970
REQUIRES A JUDICIAL WARRANT AND

10:08:27.037 --> 10:08:28.605
CLEAR DOCUMENTATION BEFORE

10:08:28.672 --> 10:08:30.640
ACCESS TO NONPUBLIC AREAS IS

10:08:30.707 --> 10:08:33.043
GRANTED AND CONCLUSION. SB 841

10:08:33.109 --> 10:08:34.678
IS NOT ABOUT POLITICS, IT'S

10:08:34.744 --> 10:08:36.079
ABOUT PEOPLE. IT'S ABOUT

10:08:36.146 --> 10:08:37.247
CHILDREN SLEEPING THROUGH THE

10:08:37.314 --> 10:08:39.015
NIGHT WITHOUT FEAR, ABOUT

10:08:39.082 --> 10:08:40.016
SURVIVORS STEPPING INTO A

10:08:40.083 --> 10:08:41.218
SHELTER AND KNOWING THAT THEY

10:08:41.284 --> 10:08:42.686
WILL NOT BE RETRAUMATIZED BY THE

10:08:42.752 --> 10:08:44.454
THREAT OF DEPORTATION. IT'S

10:08:44.521 --> 10:08:45.755
ABOUT RESTORING TRUST IN THE

10:08:45.822 --> 10:08:46.923
SYSTEMS THAT ARE MEANT TO

10:08:46.990 --> 10:08:48.859
SUPPORT AND PROTECT. I URGE YOU

10:08:48.925 --> 10:08:50.594
TO SUPPORT SB 841 AND ENSURE

10:08:50.660 --> 10:08:51.962
THAT EVERY SURVIVOR OF GENDER

10:08:52.028 --> 10:08:53.730
BASED VIOLENCE, REGARDLESS OF

10:08:53.797 --> 10:08:55.131
IMMIGRATION STATUS, HAS A TRUE

10:08:55.198 --> 10:08:56.566
OPPORTUNITY TO FIND SAFETY,

10:08:56.633 --> 10:08:59.035
SECURITY AND HOPE. THANK YOU.

10:08:59.102 --> 10:09:00.670
THANK YOU, SENATOR, FOR THE

10:09:00.737 --> 10:09:01.471
PRESENTATION AND FOR YOUR

10:09:01.538 --> 10:09:03.073
PATIENCE WITH THE LAST MATTER.

10:09:03.139 --> 10:09:04.341
AND THANK YOU BOTH FOR STICKING

EDUCATIONAL MOMENT FOR ME. IT'S

10:10:38.134 --> 10:10:39.836
JUST KEEP IN MIND THAT

10:10:39.903 --> 10:10:40.971

GENERAL AND TO HAVE TO DECIDE TO

10:10:47.510 --> 10:10:48.878
TAKE A BEATING BECAUSE YOU'RE

10:10:48.945 --> 10:10:50.947
AFRAID TO GO TO ONE OF THESE

10:10:51.014 --> 10:10:52.148
SHELTERS IS UNCONSCIONABLE. AND

10:10:52.215 --> 10:10:53.950
I THINK THAT WE NEED TO DO

10:10:54.017 --> 10:10:55.318
BETTER. AND I WILL JUST ADD

10:10:55.385 --> 10:10:56.419
ANYBODY THAT DOESN'T SUPPORT THE

10:10:56.486 --> 10:10:57.887
BILL. YOU'RE REALLY STANDING

10:10:57.954 --> 10:11:01.091
WITH THOSE ABUSERS, RAPISTS AND

10:11:01.157 --> 10:11:02.158
PERPETRATORS. BECAUSE IF A

10:11:02.225 --> 10:11:04.327
VICTIM DOESN'T COME FORWARD

10:11:04.394 --> 10:11:06.496
BECAUSE OF FEAR, NUMBER ONE, WE

10:11:06.563 --> 10:11:08.331
FAILED THEM AS A SOCIETY. BUT

10:11:08.398 --> 10:11:12.002

10:11:17.007 --> 10:11:18.808
SENATOR. I DO RECOMMEND DENY. I

10:11:18.875 --> 10:11:20.844
THINK IT'S SOUND POLICY. IF YOU

10:11:20.910 --> 10:11:22.512
NEED A COAUTHOR IN THE ASSEMBLY

10:11:22.579 --> 10:11:23.713
OR IF THERE'S ROOM FOR ANOTHER

10:11:23.780 --> 10:11:26.116
ONE, I WOULD BE HAPPY TO JUMP

10:11:26.182 --> 10:11:27.617
ON. I THINK IT'S A RIGHTEOUS

10:11:27.684 --> 10:11:28.818
CAUSE. AND THANK YOU FOR

10:11:28.885 --> 10:11:30.086

MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS, FOR

10:12:40.190 --> 10:12:41.891

SAFETY AND JUSTICE. I'LL TURN IT

10:12:59.609 --> 10:13:03.113
OVER TO THEM TO PROVIDE

10:13:03.179 --> 10:13:04.280
TESTIMONY. I'M READING THIS ON

10:13:04.347 --> 10:13:07.150
BEHALF OF AINAN HARRIS. HE HAD

10:13:07.217 --> 10:13:09.119
TO CATCH A FLIGHT BACK HOME, BUT

10:13:09.185 --> 10:13:11.221
HE WAS HERE ALL DAY AND ALL

10:13:11.287 --> 10:13:13.156
THAT. HE WAS A FORMERLY

10:13:13.223 --> 10:13:14.023
INCARCERATED FIREFIGHTER, FOUGHT

10:13:14.090 --> 10:13:15.825
A LOT OF FIRES. AND SO I'M GOING

10:13:15.892 --> 10:13:18.294
TO READ ON. IN 2020, THE

10:13:18.361 --> 10:13:19.829
ASSEMBLY MEMBER, GÓMEZ REYES,

10:13:19.896 --> 10:13:22.832
LED THE PASSAGE OF AB 2147,

10:13:22.899 --> 10:13:24.634
WHICH CREATED A PROCESS ALLOWING

10:13:24.701 --> 10:13:26.302
FORMERLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE WHO

10:13:26.369 --> 10:13:29.105
HAVE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED FIRE

10:13:29.172 --> 10:13:31.608
C¢M TO PETITION FOR RECORD

10:13:31.674 --> 10:13:34.077
EXPUNGEMENT. AB 2147 WAS AN

10:13:34.144 --> 10:13:36.246
IMPORTANT FIRST STEP, BUT IT

10:13:36.312 --> 10:13:37.947
HASN'T RESOLVED THE ISSUE.

10:13:38.014 --> 10:13:40.216
PETITIONS CAN TAKE MONTHS OR

10:13:40.283 --> 10:13:42.452
YEARS, AND THERE IS NO GUARANTEE

10:13:42.519 --> 10:13:45.321
OF AN EXPUNGEMENT. I MYSELF WAS

10:13:45.388 --> 10:13:48.224
A WILDLAND FIREFIGHTER FOR

10:13:48.291 --> 10:13:50.593
CUESTA CAMP CREW THREE. I WAS A

10:13:50.660 --> 10:13:53.530
SAWYER WHO RAN THE SECOND SAU

10:13:53.596 --> 10:13:55.298
FOR CREW THREE, AND I CAN TELL

10:13:55.365 --> 10:13:56.966
YOU THAT IT CHANGED MY LIFE. IT

10:13:57.033 --> 10:13:58.268
WAS THE HARDEST WORK I'VE EVER

10:13:58.334 --> 10:14:01.104
DONE IN MY LIFE AND AT THE SAME

10:14:01.171 --> 10:14:01.771
TIME, THE MOST FULFILLING WORK.

10:14:01.838 --> 10:14:03.673
ONCE WE PUT ASIDE THE FEAR AND

10:14:03.740 --> 10:14:05.475
THE ANGST AND MOVE AS A UNIT TO

10:14:05.542 --> 10:14:07.277
ACCOMPLISH OUR TASK OF LITERALLY

10:14:07.343 --> 10:14:09.179
FIGHTING FIRES WITH HAND TOOLS

10:14:09.245 --> 10:14:10.813
AND CHAINSAWS, THERE IS A SENSE

10:14:10.880 --> 10:14:13.049
OF PRIDE AND JOY THAT COMES OVER

10:14:13.116 --> 10:14:15.151
A CREW. SOMETHING HAPPENS WITHIN

10:14:15.218 --> 10:14:16.886
US, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE

10:14:16.953 --> 10:14:19.422
GRUELING TRAINING AND ALL NIGHT

10:14:19.489 --> 10:14:22.325
FIRE WATCHES WEREN'T SO BAD. WE

10:14:22.392 --> 10:14:24.227
YEARN TO BE OF SERVICE. WE TAKE

10:14:24.294 --> 10:14:25.862
PRIDE IN BEING PROTECTORS AND

10:14:25.929 --> 10:14:28.164
NOT DESTROYERS, AND WE DREAM OF

10:14:28.231 --> 10:14:30.433
BEING ABLE TO DO THIS FOR A

10:14:30.500 --> 10:14:32.468
LIVING IN A YELLOW CAL FIRE

10:14:32.535 --> 10:14:33.937
UNIFORM. THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS

10:14:34.003 --> 10:14:36.940
SO IMPORTANT. MANY JUDGES REMAIN

10:14:37.006 --> 10:14:38.474
UNINFORMED ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF

10:14:38.541 --> 10:14:41.010
THE LAW AND WHY IT WAS CREATED.

10:14:41.077 --> 10:14:42.478
WHILE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF

10:14:42.545 --> 10:14:43.913
COMPLETED EXPUNGEMENT IS

10:14:43.980 --> 10:14:46.449
UNKNOWN, IT IS ESTIMATED TO BE A

10:14:46.516 --> 10:14:47.183
VERY LOW FIGURE. GIVEN THE

10:14:47.250 --> 10:14:48.985
AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES FOR

10:14:49.052 --> 10:14:50.787
SOMEONE TO COMPLETE THE PROCESS

10:14:50.853 --> 10:14:53.356
WITHOUT AN EXPUNGEMENT. FORMERLY

10:14:53.423 --> 10:14:54.390
INCARCERATED HAND CREWS CAN'T

10:14:54.457 --> 10:14:57.927
PURSUE NECESSARY CREDENTIALS.

10:14:57.994 --> 10:14:59.662
CREDENTIAL CREDENTIALS, SUCH AS

10:14:59.729 --> 10:15:02.365
AN EMT CERTIFICATION, WHICH

10:15:02.432 --> 10:15:05.235
WHICH IS A PREREQUISITE FOR MOST

10:15:05.301 --> 10:15:07.237
FIREFIGHTER JOB POSITION. SENATE

10:15:07.303 --> 10:15:10.506
BILL TWO 4245 BUILDS ON AB 2147

10:15:10.573 --> 10:15:12.775
BY AUTOMATING THE EXISTING

10:15:12.842 --> 10:15:14.510
EXPUNGEMENT PROCESS, REMOVING

10:15:14.577 --> 10:15:16.179
THE REQUIREMENT FROM FOR THE

10:15:16.246 --> 10:15:18.214
INDIVIDUAL TO SUBMIT A PETITION,

10:15:18.281 --> 10:15:19.849
IT USES THE EXISTING CANNABIS

10:15:19.916 --> 10:15:21.284
EXPUNGEMENT PROCESS AS THE

10:15:21.351 --> 10:15:23.553
TEMPLATE. SENATE BILL 245 DOES

10:15:23.620 --> 10:15:25.555
NOT CHANGE WHO CAN GET AN

10:15:25.622 --> 10:15:27.490
EXPUNGEMENT. THE ELIGIBILITY

10:15:27.557 --> 10:15:29.726
RESTRICTIONS ENACTED UNDER AB

10:15:29.792 --> 10:15:32.528
2147 FOR CONVICTIONS SUCH AS

10:15:32.595 --> 10:15:34.364
ARSON OR MURDER ARE RETAINED

10:15:34.430 --> 10:15:36.966
UNDER SENATE BILL 245. THE MORE

10:15:37.033 --> 10:15:39.636
WE REMOVE BARRIERS TO REENTRY

10:15:39.702 --> 10:15:41.504
AND GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT POST

10:15:41.571 --> 10:15:43.172
RELIEF, THE MORE WE ARE ABLE TO

10:15:43.239 --> 10:15:44.841
LOWER RECIDIVISM RATES AND

10:15:44.907 --> 10:15:46.843
IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY FOR ALL

10:15:46.909 --> 10:15:48.077
CALIFORNIANS. AND HE'S BEEN

10:15:48.144 --> 10:15:49.879

10:15:49.946 --> 10:15:52.382
EXPUNGEMENT AND HE HASN'T GOT

10:15:52.448 --> 10:15:54.851
IT. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. GOOD

10:15:54.917 --> 10:15:56.386

JUSTICE AND PROUD CO-SPONSOR OF

10:16:03.559 --> 10:16:07.030
SB 245. THE DEVASTATION THE

CALIFORNIA IS WELL KNOWN TO

10:16:09.265 --> 10:16:11.134
THOSE WHO CALL CALIFORNIA HOME.
