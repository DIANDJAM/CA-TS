HAVE BEFORE YOU YOU ACTUALLY

YOU. THE FIRST IS SB 27, WHICH

IS THE ANNUAL CARE COURT CLEANUP

00:37:57.375 --> 00:37:59.877
BILL. THANK YOU, MISS MERRILEES,

FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE ON THIS

00:38:01.078 --> 00:38:03.514
BILL. THIS IS A CLEANUP BILL AND

00:38:03.581 --> 00:38:05.316
REQUIRES THE COURTS TO CONSIDER

00:38:05.383 --> 00:38:07.885
CARE REFERRAL AS AN OPTION FOR

00:38:07.952 --> 00:38:09.654
MISDEMEANOR INCOMPETENT TO STAND

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.522
TRIAL. DEFENDANTS. THOSE WHO ARE

00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:12.957
CHARGED WITH MISDEMEANOR, WHO

00:38:13.024 --> 00:38:15.459
ARE DEEMED TO BE NOT COMPETENT,

00:38:15.526 --> 00:38:17.528
TO BE ABLE TO STAND TRIAL, TO BE

00:38:17.595 --> 00:38:19.196
ABLE TO ASSIST COUNSEL IN THEIR

00:38:19.263 --> 00:38:20.231
DEFENSE. IT ALSO COMBINES

00:38:20.297 --> 00:38:21.832
CERTAIN HEARINGS TO CREATE MORE

00:38:21.899 --> 00:38:22.933
EFFICIENCY, ALLOWS THE SHARING

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.570
OF DATA BETWEEN CARE PARTNERS

00:38:26.637 --> 00:38:28.739
WHO ARE LICENSED MEDICAL

00:38:28.806 --> 00:38:30.675
PROFESSIONALS. IT ALSO CHANGES

00:38:30.741 --> 00:38:32.610
THE ELIGIBILITY AND DEFINITIONS

00:38:32.677 --> 00:38:34.445
IN TERMS OF THOSE WHO ARE

00:38:34.512 --> 00:38:36.947
ELIGIBLE. FOR EXAMPLE, IT ALLOWS

PSYCHOTIC FEATURES TO ALSO BE

00:38:41.385 --> 00:38:42.753
INCLUDED IN THE UNIVERSE OF

00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:44.221
THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR CARE.

00:38:44.288 --> 00:38:45.923
COURT. WITH ME TO TESTIFY TODAY

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:47.525
IS DOCTOR AARON MEYER, A

00:38:47.591 --> 00:38:48.893
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OFFICER, CITY

00:38:48.959 --> 00:38:52.063
OF SAN DIEGO, AS WELL AS AN

00:38:52.129 --> 00:38:54.632
HADREAS WITH THE JUDICIAL

00:38:54.699 --> 00:38:55.900
COUNCIL OF THE STATE OF

00:38:55.966 --> 00:38:57.134
CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. THANK

00:38:57.201 --> 00:38:58.002
YOU, MISTER CHAIR. GOOD MORNING,

00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:59.704
CHAIR. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE.

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:01.439
MY NAME IS AARON MEYER. I'M A

00:39:01.505 --> 00:39:02.840
PRACTICING PSYCHIATRIST AND

00:39:02.907 --> 00:39:04.508
ASSISTANT CLINICAL PROFESSOR AT

00:39:04.575 --> 00:39:06.010
THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,

00:39:06.077 --> 00:39:07.912
SAN DIEGO. I'M NOT SPEAKING ON

00:39:07.978 --> 00:39:09.447
BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY OF

00:39:09.513 --> 00:39:11.549
CALIFORNIA, BUT I'M HERE TODAY

00:39:11.615 --> 00:39:12.116
AS A CONTRACTED BEHAVIORAL

00:39:12.183 --> 00:39:13.684
HEALTH OFFICER OF THE CITY OF

00:39:13.751 --> 00:39:15.453
SAN DIEGO, PROUD SUPPORTER OF

00:39:15.519 --> 00:39:17.722
SENATE BILL 27. SO ONE OF THE

00:39:17.788 --> 00:39:18.689
CURRENT CHALLENGES IN

00:39:18.756 --> 00:39:19.690
IMPLEMENTING THE CARE ACT IS

00:39:19.757 --> 00:39:21.592
THAT THE PHRASE CLINICALLY

00:39:21.659 --> 00:39:23.661
STABILIZED IN ONGOING VOLUNTARY

00:39:23.728 --> 00:39:25.963
TREATMENT IS NOT DEFINED. SADLY,

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:27.264
PETITIONS HAVE BEEN DISMISSED

00:39:27.331 --> 00:39:28.733
BECAUSE ENROLLMENT IN AN ACT

00:39:28.799 --> 00:39:31.068
PROGRAM ALONE HAS BEEN EQUATED

00:39:31.135 --> 00:39:32.703
WITH STABILIZATION. STABILITY IN

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:34.405
AN ACT PROGRAM MUST BE

00:39:34.472 --> 00:39:35.940
QUESTIONED WHEN SOMEONE IS

00:39:36.006 --> 00:39:38.042
CALLING 911 MORE THAN 20 TIMES

00:39:38.109 --> 00:39:40.211
IN A MONTH, EVEN AFTER

00:39:40.277 --> 00:39:42.046
ENROLLMENT. CITY FIRST

00:39:42.113 --> 00:39:43.514
RESPONDERS KNOW ALL TOO WELL

00:39:43.581 --> 00:39:45.282
THAT SIMPLE ENROLLMENT AND

00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:46.717
SUCCESSFUL ENGAGEMENT ARE TWO

00:39:46.784 --> 00:39:48.586
DIFFERENT THINGS. SO SENATE BILL

00:39:48.652 --> 00:39:50.354
27 CLARIFIES THE MEANING OF

00:39:50.421 --> 00:39:52.823
CLINICALLY STABILIZED TO MEAN

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:54.658
THAT SOMEONE IS STABLE AND NOT

00:39:54.725 --> 00:39:56.560
DETERIORATING, LIKELY TO SURVIVE

00:39:56.627 --> 00:39:58.262
SAFELY IN THE COMMUNITY WITHOUT

00:39:58.329 --> 00:39:59.864
SUPERVISION, MANAGING SYMPTOMS

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:01.532
THROUGH MEDICATION OR OTHER

00:40:01.599 --> 00:40:02.967
THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS, AND

00:40:03.033 --> 00:40:04.335
THAT THEIR MENTAL HEALTH

00:40:04.401 --> 00:40:05.669
CONDITION IS NOT NEGATIVELY

00:40:05.736 --> 00:40:07.338
IMPACTING THEIR ABILITY TO LIVE

00:40:07.404 --> 00:40:09.173
SAFELY WITHIN THE COMMUNITY OR

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.775
CURRENT HOUSING SITUATION. THIS

00:40:10.841 --> 00:40:13.043
MATTER IS NOW IN LOS ANGELES

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:15.813
COUNTY. 33% OF THEIR DISMISSED

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:16.881
PETITIONS WAS BECAUSE THE PERSON

00:40:16.947 --> 00:40:19.183
WAS ADEQUATELY TREATED, AND

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:20.851
OUTPATIENT MENTAL HEALTH. WHY

00:40:20.918 --> 00:40:23.921
WOULD 33% OF PETITIONS BE

00:40:23.988 --> 00:40:25.589
SUBMITTED IF THE PERSON WAS

00:40:25.656 --> 00:40:28.425
CURRENTLY STABLE? AND SO, AS AN

00:40:28.492 --> 00:40:31.762
EXAMPLE, A PENDING CARE PETITION

00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:32.630
INVOLVES AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS

00:40:32.696 --> 00:40:34.064
NOT CHANGED THEIR CLOTHES IN

00:40:34.131 --> 00:40:36.801
OVER A YEAR, REQUIRING PROMPTING

00:40:36.867 --> 00:40:37.668
TO EAT. SOMEONE ELSE IS USING

00:40:37.735 --> 00:40:40.704
THEIR EBT CARD. THEY'RE UNABLE

00:40:40.771 --> 00:40:42.173
TO UTILIZE SSI BENEFITS. THEY

00:40:42.239 --> 00:40:43.974
REFUSE TO MOVE TO A MORE

00:40:44.041 --> 00:40:45.142
SUPPORTED SETTING DUE TO

00:40:45.209 --> 00:40:46.944
PARANOIA, REPORTING ADHERENCE TO

00:40:47.011 --> 00:40:47.845
MEDICATIONS DESPITE THOSE

00:40:47.912 --> 00:40:49.380
MEDICATIONS NOT BEING IN THEIR

00:40:49.446 --> 00:40:50.848
POSSESSION. THIS PERSON IS

00:40:50.915 --> 00:40:52.650
ALREADY ENROLLED IN AN ACT

00:40:52.716 --> 00:40:54.018
PROGRAM, SO. BUT WITHOUT A

00:40:54.084 --> 00:40:55.486
DEFINITION OF CLINICALLY

00:40:55.553 --> 00:40:56.987
STABILIZED AND ONGOING VOLUNTARY

00:40:57.054 --> 00:40:58.722
TREATMENT, THAT PETITION COULD

00:40:58.789 --> 00:41:01.992
BE DISMISSED TO. GO AHEAD AND

00:41:02.059 --> 00:41:03.727
FINISH UP. SO THE HOPE OF THE

00:41:03.794 --> 00:41:05.462
CARE ACT PROGRAM WAS TO HOLD

00:41:05.529 --> 00:41:05.963
COUNTIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:08.065
TREATING THOSE WITH THE MOST

00:41:08.132 --> 00:41:09.133
SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS, WHOSE

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.234
VULNERABILITY AND SEVERITY OF

00:41:10.301 --> 00:41:12.069
ILLNESS CAUSES THEM TO SLIP

00:41:12.136 --> 00:41:13.237
THROUGH THE CRACKS OF A SYSTEM

00:41:13.304 --> 00:41:14.872
THAT CATERS TO THOSE WHO ARE

00:41:14.939 --> 00:41:16.307
LESS FUNCTIONALLY IMPAIRED.

00:41:16.373 --> 00:41:18.509
SENATE BILL 27 CREATES CLARITY

00:41:18.576 --> 00:41:20.678
SO INDIVIDUALS WHO REQUIRE MORE

00:41:20.744 --> 00:41:22.847
SUPPORT RECEIVE IT. SO THANK

00:41:22.913 --> 00:41:24.281
YOU, SENATOR UMBERG, FOR YOUR

00:41:24.348 --> 00:41:25.382
COMMITMENT TO THE MOST

00:41:25.449 --> 00:41:27.284
VULNERABLE, WHO ARE ALL TOO

00:41:27.351 --> 00:41:29.553
OFTEN SEEN THE MOST, BUT TREATED

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:36.861
THE LEAST. THANK YOU. GOOD

00:41:36.927 --> 00:41:38.295
MORNING, ANNE HADREAS FROM THE

JUDICIAL COUNCIL. AND JUST TO

00:41:40.231 --> 00:41:41.198
CLARIFY, THE COUNCIL HAS NOT

00:41:41.265 --> 00:41:43.300
TAKEN A POSITION ON THIS BILL.

00:41:43.367 --> 00:41:45.836

PROCESS AS IT EXISTS NOW, AND

00:41:52.743 --> 00:41:54.912
HOW IT MIGHT EXIST UNDER THESE

00:41:54.979 --> 00:41:58.382
AMENDMENTS. THE GOAL IS

00:41:58.449 --> 00:42:02.019
STREAMLINING TO TRY TO INCREASE

00:42:02.086 --> 00:42:05.256
EFFICIENCY, BUT ALSO INCREASE

00:42:05.322 --> 00:42:06.690
FLEXIBILITY FOR COURTS TO FIND

00:42:06.757 --> 00:42:09.627

CALIFORNIA. AND WE ARE IN

00:44:53.991 --> 00:44:56.460
OPPOSITION OF SB 27. OUR REASONS

00:44:56.527 --> 00:44:57.761
ARE ARTICULATED IN OUR

00:44:57.828 --> 00:44:59.897
COALITION'S LETTER, ONE OF THE

00:44:59.963 --> 00:45:02.099
MANY REASONS THAT WE OPPOSE

00:45:02.166 --> 00:45:03.901
INCLUDE THE EXPANSION OF ADDING

MOOD DISORDERS WITH PSYCHOTIC

00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:10.074
FEATURES TO THE CRITERIA FOR

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:12.943
CARE COURT. AS FANNIE LOU HAMER

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:14.745
ONCE SAID, WE ARE SICK AND TIRED

00:45:14.812 --> 00:45:17.214
OF BEING SICK AND TIRED. IN

00:45:17.281 --> 00:45:19.016
2022, MY COLLEAGUES AND I WERE

00:45:19.083 --> 00:45:20.517
TOLD BY THE CHAMPIONS OF CARE

00:45:20.584 --> 00:45:22.553
COURT THAT IT WOULD BE A

00:45:22.619 --> 00:45:24.254
VOLUNTARY AND ONLY THAT IT WOULD

00:45:24.321 --> 00:45:26.190
BE VOLUNTARY AND ONLY COVER A

00:45:26.256 --> 00:45:28.325
SMALL PORTION OF THE DISABILITY

00:45:28.392 --> 00:45:30.828
COMMUNITY. EVER SINCE, EVERY

00:45:30.894 --> 00:45:32.663
YEAR THE CHAMPIONS OF CARE COURT

00:45:32.729 --> 00:45:35.165
PUSH FOR EXPANSION, CALIFORNIA

00:45:35.232 --> 00:45:37.067
REMAINS IN A HOUSING CRISIS AND

00:45:37.134 --> 00:45:39.470
THE STATE STILL IS NOT PROVIDING

00:45:39.536 --> 00:45:41.305
ENOUGH ACCESSIBLE MENTAL HEALTH

00:45:41.371 --> 00:45:43.107
SERVICES FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT.

00:45:43.173 --> 00:45:45.275
WE WARN THE COMMUNITY AND

00:45:45.342 --> 00:45:46.777
POLICYMAKERS THEN, THAT THE

00:45:46.844 --> 00:45:47.744
CHAMPIONS OF CARE COURT WOULD

00:45:47.811 --> 00:45:50.747
NOT STOP, BUT WOULD EXPAND TO

00:45:50.814 --> 00:45:52.816
COVER MORE UNHOUSED PEOPLE WITH

00:45:52.883 --> 00:45:54.651
MENTAL HEALTH DISABILITIES AND

00:45:54.718 --> 00:45:56.386
BEYOND. AND THIS IS WHAT SB 27

00:45:56.453 --> 00:45:58.956
WOULD DO AFTER OUR EXPERTS WITH

00:45:59.022 --> 00:46:00.324
MENTAL HEALTH DISABILITIES AND

00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:02.593
OTHER COMMUNITY MEMBERS WERE

00:46:02.659 --> 00:46:03.627
DISRESPECTED BY THE CHAMPIONS OF

00:46:03.694 --> 00:46:06.130
CARE COURT AND TOLD THAT THIS IS

00:46:06.196 --> 00:46:08.332
WHAT THE COMMUNITY WANTED, THE

00:46:08.398 --> 00:46:11.135
LATEST DATA SHOWS THAT ONLY 100

00:46:11.201 --> 00:46:12.402
PEOPLE ACTUALLY HAVE GONE

00:46:12.469 --> 00:46:17.074
THROUGH THE ENTIRE PROCESS, NOT

00:46:17.141 --> 00:46:18.008
100,100 PEOPLE. THERE ARE

00:46:18.075 --> 00:46:20.244
PROBABLY 100 PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM

00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:24.715
RIGHT NOW. APPROXIMATELY $70

00:46:24.781 --> 00:46:26.383
MILLION HAS BEEN SPENT SO FAR.

00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:28.719
NO HOUSING HAS BEEN PROVIDED FOR

00:46:28.785 --> 00:46:31.622
ANY INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED. AS

00:46:31.688 --> 00:46:33.257
EXPERTS FROM OUR COMMUNITY

00:46:33.323 --> 00:46:35.492
WARNED CARE COURT IS A WASTE OF

00:46:35.559 --> 00:46:38.595
MONEY AND SO WOULD SB 27. AS WE

00:46:38.662 --> 00:46:40.497
WARNED, BLACK PEOPLE ARE

00:46:40.564 --> 00:46:41.398
DISPROPORTIONATELY REPRESENTED

00:46:41.465 --> 00:46:43.433
IN THE CARE COURT PROCESS AND OF

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:45.836
THE PEOPLE FORCED INTO THIS

00:46:45.903 --> 00:46:47.604
PROCESS ARE IMPACTED BY MANY

00:46:47.671 --> 00:46:49.606
OTHER SYSTEMS. LET'S ACTUALLY

00:46:49.673 --> 00:46:52.676
PUT FORWARD POLICIES TO PROVIDE

00:46:52.743 --> 00:46:54.511
SERVICES AND HOUSING FOR THE

00:46:54.578 --> 00:46:56.413
COMMUNITY. IF THE STATE WANTS TO

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:57.447
ACTUALLY WORK WITH THE

00:46:57.514 --> 00:46:59.183
COMMUNITY, WITH THE COMMUNITY

00:46:59.249 --> 00:47:00.584
MEMBERS IMPACTED BY THESE

00:47:00.651 --> 00:47:02.553
SYSTEMS AND DISABLED LEADERS, WE

00:47:02.619 --> 00:47:04.788
ARE NOT HARD TO FIND. THANK YOU.

00:47:04.855 --> 00:47:07.424
THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING, MISTER

ALL 58 CALIFORNIA COUNTIES,

00:47:18.502 --> 00:47:20.437
CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTING CARE

00:47:20.504 --> 00:47:23.941
COURT FAITHFULLY. OUR MEMBERS

00:47:24.007 --> 00:47:26.076
ARE PROUD OF THE WORK THAT WE

00:47:26.143 --> 00:47:27.911
HAVE DONE THROUGH CARE COURT TO

00:47:27.978 --> 00:47:29.746
LIFT THIS PROGRAM UP IN SHORT

00:47:29.813 --> 00:47:31.715
ORDER ACROSS ALL 58 COUNTIES.

00:47:31.782 --> 00:47:33.650
AND THE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE'VE

00:47:33.717 --> 00:47:35.852
DEVELOPED, NOT ONLY WITH THE

00:47:35.919 --> 00:47:37.721
GOVERNOR IN MOVING FORWARD THIS

00:47:37.788 --> 00:47:39.056
INITIATIVE, BUT WITH, MORE

00:47:39.122 --> 00:47:40.557
IMPORTANTLY, LOCAL COMMUNITIES,

00:47:40.624 --> 00:47:43.694
WITH CLIENTS. ET CETERA. WE

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.395
UNFORTUNATELY WERE NOT AWARE OF

00:47:45.462 --> 00:47:47.331
THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS,

00:47:47.397 --> 00:47:48.632
SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS TO THIS

00:47:48.699 --> 00:47:51.301
BILL, WHICH ARE EXTENSIVE. AND

00:47:51.368 --> 00:47:54.171
GIVEN THE URGENCY CLAUSE, WE

00:47:54.238 --> 00:47:56.273
URGE THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER

00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:58.508
WHAT IT WOULD MEAN IN TERMS OF

00:47:58.575 --> 00:48:02.179
THE QUALITY AND ACCESS, AND TO

00:48:02.246 --> 00:48:03.714
DRIVE AN INDIVIDUAL INTO THE

00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:04.982
CARE COURT PROCESS, REALLY,

00:48:05.048 --> 00:48:06.416
WITHOUT THE SUPPORTS AND

00:48:06.483 --> 00:48:09.419
RESOURCES NEEDED FOR THEM. FOR

00:48:09.486 --> 00:48:10.821
EXAMPLE. AND I KNOW THAT SOME OF

00:48:10.887 --> 00:48:11.822
THIS IS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE

00:48:11.888 --> 00:48:14.391
COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS, BUT

00:48:14.458 --> 00:48:16.193
CURRENTLY, THE ELIGIBLE

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:18.028
POPULATION, IN TERMS OF

00:48:18.095 --> 00:48:19.696
PREVALENCE OF INDIVIDUALS WITH

00:48:19.763 --> 00:48:23.934
SCHIZOPHRENIA IS AROUND 0.33 TO

00:48:24.001 --> 00:48:25.636
0.75 OF THE TOTAL POPULATION,

00:48:25.702 --> 00:48:27.304
WHEREAS MOOD DISORDERS. THE

00:48:27.371 --> 00:48:30.607
PROPOSED EXPANSION ENCOMPASSES

00:48:30.674 --> 00:48:33.076
9.7% OF THE POPULATION. EVEN

00:48:33.143 --> 00:48:35.245
WHEN YOU TAKE DOWN TO PEOPLE

00:48:35.312 --> 00:48:37.381
WITH PSYCHOTIC FEATURES WHO HAVE

00:48:37.447 --> 00:48:38.915
MOOD MOOD DISORDERS, THAT'S

00:48:38.982 --> 00:48:42.819
STILL 10 TO 20% OF THAT 10%

00:48:42.886 --> 00:48:44.087
EXPANSION OF THE POPULATION.

00:48:44.154 --> 00:48:47.190
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ORDER OF

00:48:47.257 --> 00:48:49.126
MAGNITUDE, REALLY, REALLY

00:48:49.192 --> 00:48:51.028
OUTSIDE OF THE SCOPE OF WHAT WE

00:48:51.094 --> 00:48:52.863
ARE PREPARED TO DO IMMEDIATELY

00:48:52.929 --> 00:48:56.566
UPON ENACTMENT OF THIS LAW, NOT

00:48:56.633 --> 00:48:58.535
TO MENTION THE LACK OF HOUSING,

00:48:58.602 --> 00:49:01.838
WHICH OUR COLLEAGUES WITH DRC

00:49:01.905 --> 00:49:03.740
MENTIONED, CARE COURT DID NOT

00:49:03.807 --> 00:49:05.475
BRING WITH IT, NECESSARILY

00:49:05.542 --> 00:49:06.910
RESOURCES COUNTIES HAVE BEEN

00:49:06.977 --> 00:49:08.378
IMPLEMENTING ONE TIME BEHAVIORAL

00:49:08.445 --> 00:49:10.580
HEALTH BRIDGE HOUSING, WHICH HAS

00:49:10.647 --> 00:49:12.416
ASSISTED, BUT WE WOULD NOT HAVE

00:49:12.482 --> 00:49:14.951
THE STAFF, THE RESOURCES OR THE

00:49:15.018 --> 00:49:17.054
HOUSING TO RESPONSIBLY CARE FOR

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:18.188
INDIVIDUALS. AND FOR THOSE

00:49:18.255 --> 00:49:19.923
REASONS, IN ADDITION TO SOME

00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:21.625
OTHERS, WE ARE RESPECTFULLY

00:49:21.692 --> 00:49:22.859
OPPOSED TO THIS MEASURE. THANK

00:49:22.926 --> 00:49:23.927
YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE THAT

00:49:23.994 --> 00:49:26.330
HAS NOT HAD A CHANCE TO EXPRESS

00:49:26.396 --> 00:49:28.899
EITHER SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION?

00:49:28.965 --> 00:49:31.034
OKAY, I WILL BRING IT BACK TO

00:49:31.101 --> 00:49:31.902
COMMITTEE. WE DON'T HAVE A

00:49:31.968 --> 00:49:33.470
QUORUM, SO ARE THERE ANY

00:49:33.537 --> 00:49:34.438
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS? YES,

00:49:34.504 --> 00:49:36.840
MADAM VICE CHAIR, A COUPLE

00:49:36.907 --> 00:49:38.909
THINGS TO THE AUTHOR. I REALLY

00:49:38.975 --> 00:49:40.077
APPLAUD WHAT YOU'VE BEEN TRYING

00:49:40.143 --> 00:49:42.112
TO DO SINCE 2022. THIS IS

00:49:42.179 --> 00:49:45.382
IMPORTANT LAW AND NOW PROPOSED

00:49:45.449 --> 00:49:47.584
EXPANSION AS HAS BEEN DESCRIBED.

00:49:47.651 --> 00:49:48.985
AND I THINK IT'S REALLY

00:49:49.052 --> 00:49:50.187
IMPORTANT IN OUR COMMUNITIES TO

00:49:50.253 --> 00:49:51.922
HELP THE PEOPLE WHO NEED HELP.

00:49:51.988 --> 00:49:55.826
AND THE LAW HAS PREVENTED ACCESS

00:49:55.892 --> 00:49:57.961
TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS. I AM

00:49:58.028 --> 00:49:58.995
CURIOUS WITH YOUR COMMENTS,

00:49:59.062 --> 00:50:00.864
MA'AM. SO YOU SUPPORT THE CARE

00:50:00.931 --> 00:50:03.033
COURT PROCESS. THIS IS A MATTER

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:04.568
OF RESOURCING BECAUSE OF THE

00:50:04.634 --> 00:50:06.036
EXPANSION OF THE DEFINITIONS,

00:50:06.103 --> 00:50:08.038
BUT YOU'RE IN SUPPORT OF WHAT

00:50:08.105 --> 00:50:09.506
CARE COURT IS DOING TO HELP

00:50:09.573 --> 00:50:11.608
PEOPLE. BUT MAYBE HOUSING IS A

00:50:11.675 --> 00:50:14.611
PROBLEM AND OTHER STAFF

00:50:14.678 --> 00:50:16.813
RESOURCES ARE A PROBLEM. BUT THE

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:19.349
INTENT OF WHAT SENATOR UMBERG IS

00:50:19.416 --> 00:50:22.185
DOING, THE AUTHOR IS DOING, IS

00:50:22.252 --> 00:50:25.422
DO YOU OBJECT TO THAT? THERE ARE

00:50:25.489 --> 00:50:26.790
SEVERAL DIMENSIONS, RIGHT? WE'RE

00:50:26.857 --> 00:50:29.393
MAKING IT EASIER FOR DIFFERENT

00:50:29.459 --> 00:50:33.029
SYSTEMS TO REFER IN THROUGH THE

00:50:33.096 --> 00:50:34.398
REFERRALS BECOMING PETITIONS

00:50:34.464 --> 00:50:36.533
PART OF THIS BILL. SO THAT

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:38.001
EXPEDITES THE NUMBER OF

00:50:38.068 --> 00:50:40.170
REFERRALS IN OF ALL TYPES. AND

00:50:40.237 --> 00:50:41.571
THEN YOU'RE EXPANDING THE

00:50:41.638 --> 00:50:44.408
ELIGIBLE POPULATION VERY

00:50:44.474 --> 00:50:46.576
SIGNIFICANTLY. AND WE HAVE NOT

00:50:46.643 --> 00:50:48.345
HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK

00:50:48.412 --> 00:50:50.313
THROUGH WHAT THE RAMIFICATIONS

00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:53.083
OR APPROPRIATENESS OF THAT WOULD

00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:54.918
BE, BECAUSE WE'VE ONLY JUST

00:50:54.985 --> 00:50:56.052
LEARNED ABOUT THESE AMENDMENTS.

00:50:56.119 --> 00:50:59.923
AND SO I THINK THERE ARE OUR

00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:02.192
MEMBERS ARE VERY PROUD OF THE

00:51:02.259 --> 00:51:03.894
WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE WITHIN

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:06.396
CARE COURT. THE SECRET SAUCE IS

00:51:06.463 --> 00:51:09.399
REALLY IN THAT HIGH TOUCH

00:51:09.466 --> 00:51:11.468
OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT TO

00:51:11.535 --> 00:51:12.903
INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY NOT REALIZE

00:51:12.969 --> 00:51:14.604
THAT THEY NEED HELP AND CARE.

00:51:14.671 --> 00:51:16.440
COURT PROVIDES THE FIRST EVER

00:51:16.506 --> 00:51:19.009
AVENUE REALLY FOR US TO GET

00:51:19.075 --> 00:51:21.545
RESOURCING TO DO THAT. AND SO I

00:51:21.611 --> 00:51:22.779
THINK TO THE POINT OF SOME OF

00:51:22.846 --> 00:51:24.714
OUR COLLEAGUES WITH THE CONSUMER

00:51:24.781 --> 00:51:26.650
GROUPS, THERE ARE WAYS TO

00:51:26.716 --> 00:51:28.618
ACHIEVE THE OUTCOMES OF CARE

00:51:28.685 --> 00:51:32.289
COURT WITHOUT SOME OF THE OTHER

00:51:32.355 --> 00:51:33.890
PIECES TO THIS. BUT WE JUST WANT

00:51:33.957 --> 00:51:35.959
PEOPLE TO GET HELP. AND SO ANY

00:51:36.026 --> 00:51:37.327
WAY THAT WE CAN FACILITATE DOING

00:51:37.394 --> 00:51:39.696
THAT, WE ARE REALLY EXCITED TO

00:51:39.763 --> 00:51:41.398
PARTNER WITH THE STATE ON. OKAY.

00:51:41.465 --> 00:51:44.000
THANK YOU. I'D LIKE TO HAVE THE

00:51:44.067 --> 00:51:46.536
AUTHOR RESPOND AND NÓ, WELL, LET

00:51:46.603 --> 00:51:48.805
ME RESPOND TO BOTH. AS TO MR.

00:51:48.872 --> 00:51:51.107
HARRIS, HE IS CORRECT THAT WE

00:51:51.174 --> 00:51:52.309
WOULD BE MUCH BETTER OFF IN

00:51:52.375 --> 00:51:53.610
CALIFORNIA IF EVERYONE WHO HAD

00:51:53.677 --> 00:51:55.345
ANY SORT OF MENTAL ILLNESS HAD A

00:51:55.412 --> 00:51:57.214
STABLE PLACE TO GET. WELL, WE'D

00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:58.615
BE MUCH BETTER OFF IN CALIFORNIA

00:51:58.682 --> 00:52:00.617
IF WE HAD THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

00:52:00.684 --> 00:52:02.185
RESOURCES, INCLUDING PERSONNEL,

00:52:02.252 --> 00:52:03.253
TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE GOT

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:05.489
WELL. WE'D BE MUCH BETTER OFF IN

00:52:05.555 --> 00:52:08.325
CALIFORNIA IF WE HAD THE.

00:52:08.391 --> 00:52:09.493
BESIDES BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

00:52:09.559 --> 00:52:11.194
RESOURCES, ALSO THE OTHER

00:52:11.261 --> 00:52:12.696
ATTENDANT RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE

00:52:12.762 --> 00:52:16.533
THAT EVERYONE GOT WELL. AND WE

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:18.301
DON'T WE DON'T HAVE ALL THOSE

00:52:18.368 --> 00:52:19.569
RESOURCES. THIS CARE COURT IS

00:52:19.636 --> 00:52:22.005
FOCUSED ON A VERY SMALL

00:52:22.072 --> 00:52:23.840
POPULATION, BUT A VERY ILL

00:52:23.907 --> 00:52:24.875
POPULATION. AND IT IS

00:52:24.941 --> 00:52:25.976
INTERESTING, AS MR. HARRIS

00:52:26.042 --> 00:52:28.512
POINTS OUT, WE'VE HAD VERY FEW

00:52:28.578 --> 00:52:30.080
PEOPLE IN CARE COURT. BUT AS I'M

00:52:30.146 --> 00:52:32.716
SORRY, YOUR NAME AGAIN, YOUR

00:52:32.782 --> 00:52:33.350
LAST NAME IS CABRERA. MR. AND

00:52:33.416 --> 00:52:35.051
MISS CABRERA POINTS OUT IT'S TOO

00:52:35.118 --> 00:52:37.554
BIG. SO WE'RE I SUPPOSE WE'RE

00:52:37.621 --> 00:52:38.989
TRYING TO DO THE GOLDILOCKS

00:52:39.055 --> 00:52:40.123
APPROACH, WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:42.626
MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO HAVE

00:52:42.692 --> 00:52:44.728
PSYCHOTIC EPISODES WHO HAVE

00:52:44.794 --> 00:52:46.129
SCHIZOPHRENIA CAN AVAIL

00:52:46.196 --> 00:52:47.664
THEMSELVES OF CARE COURT DOESN'T

00:52:47.731 --> 00:52:49.966
MEAN THAT THEY ALL WILL BE IN

00:52:50.033 --> 00:52:51.067
CARE. COURT REQUIRES A PETITION.

00:52:51.134 --> 00:52:54.804
OFTEN A FAMILY MEMBER WHO SEEKS

00:52:54.871 --> 00:52:58.041
THE STRUCTURE OF CARE COURT.

00:52:58.108 --> 00:53:00.243
WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS THIS BILL

00:53:00.310 --> 00:53:02.345
DOES IS POINT OUT IT DOES

00:53:02.412 --> 00:53:04.314
STREAMLINE THE PROCESS. PART OF

00:53:04.381 --> 00:53:06.683
THE CHALLENGE IS, IS WE WANT A

00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:07.918
NUMBER OF TOUCHES, BOTH TOUCHES

00:53:07.984 --> 00:53:09.920
IN THE COMMUNITY, BUT WE ALSO

00:53:09.986 --> 00:53:11.154
WANT THE COURT TO BASICALLY HOLD

00:53:11.221 --> 00:53:12.556
THE SYSTEM ACCOUNTABLE, NOT JUST

00:53:12.622 --> 00:53:14.524
THE INDIVIDUAL, BUT THE COUNTY

00:53:14.591 --> 00:53:16.359
AND THOSE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE TO

00:53:16.426 --> 00:53:18.194
HELP THIS PERSON GET WELL, BE

00:53:18.261 --> 00:53:20.397
HELD ACCOUNTABLE. BUT WE DON'T

00:53:20.463 --> 00:53:21.565
WANT TO HARASS PEOPLE. WE DON'T

00:53:21.631 --> 00:53:24.568
HAVE THEM COME TO COURT FOR NO

00:53:24.634 --> 00:53:26.803
OSTENSIBLE BEHAVIORAL PURPOSE.

00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:28.805
SO JUST SIMPLY SHOWING UP FOR,

00:53:28.872 --> 00:53:30.040
YOU KNOW, SOME ADMINISTRATIVE

00:53:30.106 --> 00:53:31.508
MATTER IS NOT WORTHWHILE. SO

00:53:31.575 --> 00:53:33.009
WE'RE TRYING TO COMBINE THINGS.

00:53:33.076 --> 00:53:33.977
WE'RE ALSO TRYING TO MAKE SURE

00:53:34.044 --> 00:53:35.812
THAT WE DO CAPTURE THOSE WHO

00:53:35.879 --> 00:53:39.049
HAVE PSYCHOTIC EPISODES, PEOPLE

00:53:39.115 --> 00:53:41.551
WHO WE ALL OBSERVE, WHO ARE

00:53:41.618 --> 00:53:42.619
EXPERIENCING PSYCHOTIC EPISODES

00:53:42.686 --> 00:53:44.187
ON THE STREET. AND WE WANT TO

00:53:44.254 --> 00:53:45.889
MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE

00:53:45.956 --> 00:53:46.957
ELIGIBLE. AT LEAST ELIGIBLE

00:53:47.023 --> 00:53:47.857
DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE ENROLLED.

00:53:47.924 --> 00:53:50.193
IT JUST MEANS THAT THEY COULD BE

00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:53.096
POTENTIALLY ENROLLED. SO. AND

00:53:53.163 --> 00:53:54.698
COULD YOU CARE TO COMMENT IF

00:53:54.764 --> 00:53:57.334
IT'S RELEVANT WITH THE YEAR A

00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:59.903
YEAR AGO, WITH THE PROP ONE

00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:03.573
PASSAGE FOR BOND MEASURE FOR

00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:05.742
INCREASED MEDICAL FACILITIES,

00:54:05.809 --> 00:54:07.243
DOES THAT INTERFACE WITH CARE

00:54:07.310 --> 00:54:08.845
COURT IN ANY WAY? I DON'T KNOW.

00:54:08.912 --> 00:54:11.047
SO I'M CURIOUS. THAT'S A GREAT

00:54:11.114 --> 00:54:11.615
QUESTION. PROP ONE LARGELY

00:54:11.681 --> 00:54:12.949
PROVIDED FOR HOUSING, AND PART

00:54:13.016 --> 00:54:16.786
OF CARE COURT IS TO PROVIDE A

00:54:16.853 --> 00:54:18.054
STABILIZED ENVIRONMENT FOR

00:54:18.121 --> 00:54:20.390
SOMEONE TO GET WELL. JUDGES CAN

00:54:20.457 --> 00:54:22.258
ORDER COUNTIES TO PROVIDE

00:54:22.325 --> 00:54:24.294
HOUSING. SO I WOULD HOPE THAT

00:54:24.361 --> 00:54:26.563
THERE'S A THERE'S CONNECTIVITY.

00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:28.765
OKAY. VERY GOOD. THANK YOU.

00:54:28.832 --> 00:54:30.533
THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:33.403
OR COMMENTS. ASSEMBLY MEMBERS.

00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:34.871
GOOD MORNING SENATOR. THANK YOU

00:54:34.938 --> 00:54:38.775
FOR BEING HERE TODAY. YOU KNOW,

00:54:38.842 --> 00:54:39.909
I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THE CARE

00:54:39.976 --> 00:54:41.111
COURTS PROGRAM. SO THANK YOU FOR

00:54:41.177 --> 00:54:42.679
BRINGING THIS. AND I'LL BE

00:54:42.746 --> 00:54:44.781
SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. BUT I

00:54:44.848 --> 00:54:45.982
DO HAVE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS AND

00:54:46.049 --> 00:54:48.818
QUESTIONS. YOU KNOW, THE

00:54:48.885 --> 00:54:50.654
EXPANSION OF THE ELIGIBILITY

00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:52.455
CRITERION SEEMS TO BE RELATIVELY

00:54:52.522 --> 00:54:55.025
SIGNIFICANT AND GOES BEYOND THE

00:54:55.091 --> 00:54:57.060
MOST MENTALLY SEVERELY MENTALLY

00:54:57.127 --> 00:54:59.095
ILL, WHICH IS WHAT THE PROGRAM

00:54:59.162 --> 00:55:02.699
IS INTENDED TO SERVE IN LOOKING

00:55:02.766 --> 00:55:04.334
AT THE DEFINITION OF MOOD

00:55:04.401 --> 00:55:06.169
DISORDERS WITH PSYCHOTIC

00:55:06.236 --> 00:55:08.705
FEATURES. CAN YOU IS THAT A

00:55:08.772 --> 00:55:11.207
CLEARLY DEFINED TERM IN MEDICAL

00:55:11.274 --> 00:55:12.642
LITERATURE? COULD YOU SORT OF

00:55:12.709 --> 00:55:16.980
SPEAK TO THAT? I SAW THAT THE

00:55:17.047 --> 00:55:17.947
COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

00:55:18.014 --> 00:55:19.549
DIRECTORS NOTED THAT ALMOST 10%

00:55:19.616 --> 00:55:21.284
OF THE POPULATION HAS BEEN

00:55:21.351 --> 00:55:22.786
DIAGNOSED WITH SOME FORM OF MOOD

00:55:22.852 --> 00:55:24.487
DISORDER. SO I'M TRYING TO GET A

00:55:24.554 --> 00:55:27.323
SENSE OF HOW BIG AN EXPANSION OF

00:55:27.390 --> 00:55:29.259
THE PROGRAM THIS IS AND WHETHER

00:55:29.325 --> 00:55:33.096
OR NOT THIS IS LIKELY TO, YOU

00:55:33.163 --> 00:55:34.664
KNOW, BRING INTO THE PROGRAM

00:55:34.731 --> 00:55:36.433
FOLKS THAT ACTUALLY SHOULD,

00:55:36.499 --> 00:55:38.134
SHOULD AND CAN BE MAKING

00:55:38.201 --> 00:55:40.670
DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES. SO

00:55:40.737 --> 00:55:41.738
FORTUNATELY, I BROUGHT A

00:55:41.805 --> 00:55:43.673
PSYCHIATRIST ALONG AND PERHAPS

00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:45.875
HE CAN HELP WITH THE DEFINITION.

00:55:45.942 --> 00:55:46.910
I'LL FOLLOW ON WITH THE REST OF

00:55:46.976 --> 00:55:48.178
YOUR QUESTION. YEAH. SO

00:55:48.244 --> 00:55:50.680
TYPICALLY MOOD DISORDERS ARE

00:55:50.747 --> 00:55:52.482
INCLUSIVE OF MAJOR DEPRESSIVE

00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:53.817
DISORDER AND BIPOLAR DISORDER.

00:55:53.883 --> 00:55:55.752
THOSE ARE THE MOST COMMON MOOD

00:55:55.819 --> 00:55:57.520
DISORDERS WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE

00:55:57.587 --> 00:56:01.891
DISORDER. PROBABLY ABOUT 2 TO 5%

00:56:01.958 --> 00:56:03.760
OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAVE SOME

00:56:03.827 --> 00:56:06.262
DEGREE OF PSYCHOSIS IN THEIR

00:56:06.329 --> 00:56:07.630
LIFETIME. SO A VERY SMALL

00:56:07.697 --> 00:56:09.499
FRACTION OF THOSE WITH MAJOR

00:56:09.566 --> 00:56:10.567
DEPRESSIVE DISORDER, WITH

00:56:10.633 --> 00:56:13.803
BIPOLAR DISORDER, ANYWHERE FROM

00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:15.638
40 TO 60% IN THEIR LIFETIME WITH

00:56:15.705 --> 00:56:18.842
BIPOLAR DEPRESSION, 20% IN THEIR

00:56:18.908 --> 00:56:21.010
LIFETIME. SO IT IS A FRACTION OF

00:56:21.077 --> 00:56:22.779
PEOPLE WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE

00:56:22.846 --> 00:56:24.280
DISORDER AND BIPOLAR DISORDER.

00:56:24.347 --> 00:56:26.816
AND THAT'S ALSO IN THE CONTEXT

00:56:26.883 --> 00:56:28.752
OF IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR

00:56:28.818 --> 00:56:30.987
THE CARES ACT PROGRAM, YOU HAVE

00:56:31.054 --> 00:56:32.322
TO NOT BE CLINICALLY STABILIZED

00:56:32.388 --> 00:56:33.923
AND ONGOING TREATMENT UNLIKELY

00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:35.058
TO SURVIVE SAFELY IN THE

00:56:35.125 --> 00:56:36.860
COMMUNITY WITHOUT SUPERVISION

00:56:36.926 --> 00:56:38.661
AND PARTICIPATION IN A CARE PLAN

00:56:38.728 --> 00:56:40.130
OR CARE AGREEMENT WOULD BE THE

00:56:40.196 --> 00:56:42.165
LEAST RESTRICTIVE ALTERNATIVE

00:56:42.232 --> 00:56:43.566
NECESSARY. SO YOU HAVE THE

00:56:43.633 --> 00:56:44.734
DIAGNOSIS, WHICH IS ONE MORE

00:56:44.801 --> 00:56:46.970
TIME PARTICIPATION IN A CARE

00:56:47.036 --> 00:56:50.507
PLAN FOR Þ UNLIKELY TO SURVIVE

00:56:50.573 --> 00:56:52.976
SAFELY IN THE COMMUNITY WITHOUT

00:56:53.042 --> 00:56:54.077
SUPERVISION, AND THE PERSON'S

00:56:54.144 --> 00:56:55.945
CONDITION IS SUBSTANTIALLY

00:56:56.012 --> 00:56:57.347
DETERIORATING. SO YOU HAVE THE

00:56:57.413 --> 00:56:58.515
DIAGNOSIS, BUT THEN YOU HAVE ALL

00:56:58.581 --> 00:57:00.350
THE OTHER ELEMENTS THAT MUST BE

00:57:00.416 --> 00:57:02.218
MET IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR

00:57:02.285 --> 00:57:03.753
THE CARE ACT PROGRAM. SO IT

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:08.091
REALLY IS A SLIVER OF EVEN THE

00:57:08.158 --> 00:57:12.896
DIAGNOSIS, THE DIAGNOSTIC.

00:57:12.962 --> 00:57:14.731
SPECIFIER OF PSYCHOSIS WITH THE

00:57:14.798 --> 00:57:18.868
MOOD DISORDER. CAN I ALLOW THE

00:57:18.935 --> 00:57:20.537
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAD A COMMENT

00:57:20.603 --> 00:57:23.239
ON THAT. INDEED. YEAH. THE

00:57:23.306 --> 00:57:25.508
SOURCES THE MEDICAL LITERATURE

00:57:25.575 --> 00:57:27.510
SUGGESTS THAT THE NUMBERS ARE

00:57:27.577 --> 00:57:28.945
MUCH HIGHER. SO AGAIN, WE'RE

00:57:29.012 --> 00:57:31.347
TALKING ABOUT WHEN YOU COMPARE

00:57:31.414 --> 00:57:33.349
THE POPULATION THAT HAS

00:57:33.416 --> 00:57:36.953
SCHIZOPHRENIA, IT'S BETWEEN 0.33

00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:38.188
0.75%. AND THEN YOU HAVE TO ADD

00:57:38.254 --> 00:57:39.856
ALL THE CARE COURT CRITERIA ON

00:57:39.923 --> 00:57:42.358
TOP OF THAT. SO IT LIMITS THAT

00:57:42.425 --> 00:57:43.393
POPULATION PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY.

00:57:43.459 --> 00:57:44.928
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MOOD

00:57:44.994 --> 00:57:47.530
DISORDERS, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:57:47.597 --> 00:57:49.566
9.7% OF THE OVERALL POPULATION.

00:57:49.632 --> 00:57:51.701
NOW FOR PEOPLE WITH MAJOR

00:57:51.768 --> 00:57:54.270
DEPRESSIVE DISORDER, THE

00:57:54.337 --> 00:57:58.141
ESTIMATES ARE THAT BETWEEN 10

00:57:58.208 --> 00:57:59.509
AND 20% OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS

00:57:59.576 --> 00:58:01.544
ALSO HAVE PSYCHOTIC FEATURES.

00:58:01.611 --> 00:58:04.113
AND FOR PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCE

00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:05.348
HOSPITALIZATION DUE TO

00:58:05.415 --> 00:58:06.749
DEPRESSION, THE RATES CAN BE AS

00:58:06.816 --> 00:58:09.385
HIGH AS 25 TO 45% OF THAT MUCH

00:58:09.452 --> 00:58:11.654
LARGER POPULATION. SO WE ARE

00:58:11.721 --> 00:58:14.357
TALKING ABOUT AN EXPONENTIAL

00:58:14.424 --> 00:58:16.259
INCREASE JUST ON THE MAJOR

00:58:16.326 --> 00:58:17.760
DEPRESSIVE DISORDER SIDE OF

00:58:17.827 --> 00:58:21.264
THINGS WITH BIPOLAR DISORDER,

00:58:21.331 --> 00:58:24.400
ESTIMATES RANGE BETWEEN 40 TO

00:58:24.467 --> 00:58:25.635
60%, WHERE THEY HAVE A MANIC AND

00:58:25.702 --> 00:58:28.571
MIXED EPISODE, WHERE AROUND 20%

00:58:28.638 --> 00:58:31.107
OF THE OVERALL POPULATION WITH

00:58:31.174 --> 00:58:33.076
BIPOLAR DISORDER MAY EXPERIENCE

00:58:33.142 --> 00:58:35.445
SOME FORM OF PSYCHOSIS. AGAIN,

00:58:35.511 --> 00:58:37.113
THESE NUMBERS ARE WHEN YOU WHEN

00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:39.349
YOU TAKE THAT PERCENTAGE OUT OF

00:58:39.415 --> 00:58:41.851
THE 10% OF THE OVERALL

00:58:41.918 --> 00:58:43.920
POPULATION, MUCH, MUCH LARGER

00:58:43.987 --> 00:58:45.455
GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD

00:58:45.521 --> 00:58:47.156
QUALIFY. AND I THINK PART OF

00:58:47.223 --> 00:58:49.659
WHAT WE'RE DRIVING AT IS WE

00:58:49.726 --> 00:58:51.194
HAVEN'T HAD A POLICY

00:58:51.261 --> 00:58:52.595
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE

00:58:52.662 --> 00:58:53.997
APPROPRIATENESS ABOUT OF THIS.

00:58:54.063 --> 00:58:56.566
WE ALSO WOULD IN NO WAY BE

00:58:56.633 --> 00:58:59.035
RESOURCED OR READY TO RECEIVE

00:58:59.102 --> 00:59:02.305
THE VOLUME OF INTEREST FROM OUR

00:59:02.372 --> 00:59:05.141
COURT PARTNERS, FROM OUR STATE

00:59:05.208 --> 00:59:08.177
HOSPITALS, AS WELL AS FROM THE

00:59:08.244 --> 00:59:10.680
COMMUNITY. AND YET WE WOULD BE

00:59:10.747 --> 00:59:12.048
OBLIGATED. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

00:59:12.115 --> 00:59:13.216
TALK ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY FOR

00:59:13.283 --> 00:59:15.285
THE COUNTY. RIGHT. AND SO THE

00:59:15.351 --> 00:59:17.353
COURTS WOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT

00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:19.255
LEVERS TO PENALIZE COUNTIES FOR

00:59:19.322 --> 00:59:21.457
NOT IMMEDIATELY BEING RESPONSIVE

00:59:21.524 --> 00:59:23.526
TO THE HOUSING AND TREATMENT

00:59:23.593 --> 00:59:25.395
NEEDS. AND WHILE PROP ONE DOES

00:59:25.461 --> 00:59:27.830
PROVIDE FOR A BUILD OUT OF

00:59:27.897 --> 00:59:28.998
TREATMENT CAPACITY, PEOPLE BY

00:59:29.065 --> 00:59:30.934
AND LARGE DO NOT LIVE IN MENTAL

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:31.801
HEALTH TREATMENT FACILITIES.

00:59:31.868 --> 00:59:34.037
THEY LIVE IN HOUSING. AND SO

00:59:34.103 --> 00:59:36.839
THERE THERE IS STILL A

00:59:36.906 --> 00:59:38.374
SIGNIFICANT LACK OF AVAILABLE

00:59:38.441 --> 00:59:44.180
HOUSING RESOURCES. THANK YOU. SO

00:59:44.247 --> 00:59:47.583
YOU KNOW, I, I THINK, YOU KNOW,

00:59:47.650 --> 00:59:48.785
OBVIOUSLY I'VE SUPPORTED THE

00:59:48.851 --> 00:59:50.386
CARE COURTS. I THINK IT'S AN

00:59:50.453 --> 00:59:51.988
IMPORTANT PROGRAM. I MEAN, I

00:59:52.055 --> 00:59:53.056
HAVE PERSONAL HISTORY WITH

00:59:53.122 --> 00:59:55.191
MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY WHO OVER

00:59:55.258 --> 00:59:58.795
MANY YEARS HAD COMBINATIONS OF

00:59:58.861 --> 00:59:59.896
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WITH

00:59:59.963 --> 01:00:01.965
SUBSTANCE ABUSE. THERE. WE HAD

01:00:02.031 --> 01:00:04.500
TROUBLE WHERE THEY, I THINK,

01:00:04.567 --> 01:00:06.536
WERE NOT ABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS

01:00:06.602 --> 01:00:08.838
IN THEIR BEST INTEREST. AND SO I

01:00:08.905 --> 01:00:10.006
UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:00:10.073 --> 01:00:12.108
THIS. ON THE OTHER HAND, I THINK

01:00:12.175 --> 01:00:15.378
THE EXPANSION IS SOMETHING THAT

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:18.781
I'D ASK YOU TO PLAY REALLY CLOSE

01:00:18.848 --> 01:00:20.917
ATTENTION TO THE STANDARDS. I'M

01:00:20.984 --> 01:00:23.987
NERVOUS ABOUT, YOU KNOW, CASES

01:00:24.053 --> 01:00:26.456
WHERE WE'RE BRINGING PEOPLE INTO

01:00:26.522 --> 01:00:27.790
THE SYSTEM THAT ACTUALLY HAVE

01:00:27.857 --> 01:00:29.592
THE ABILITY TO MAKE DECISIONS ON

01:00:29.659 --> 01:00:33.463
THEIR OWN. AND, AND, AND IT

01:00:33.529 --> 01:00:36.466
BEING SORT OF SORT OF OVERBROAD.

01:00:36.532 --> 01:00:38.101
SO I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS

01:00:38.167 --> 01:00:39.669
TODAY. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR

01:00:39.736 --> 01:00:40.903
YOUR WORK. I THINK IT'S

01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:43.506
IMPORTANT WORK, BUT I WOULD HOPE

01:00:43.573 --> 01:00:44.907
THAT YOU'LL WORK WITH THE

01:00:44.974 --> 01:00:46.009
ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE AND

01:00:46.075 --> 01:00:46.976
THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE TO

01:00:47.043 --> 01:00:48.111
ASSURE THAT IT'S STRIKING THE

01:00:48.177 --> 01:00:49.779
RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN HOW MANY

01:00:49.846 --> 01:00:51.180
PEOPLE ARE IN THE ARE ELIGIBLE

01:00:51.247 --> 01:00:52.148
FOR THE PROGRAM, AND THAT

01:00:52.215 --> 01:00:53.950
THERE'S REALLY PRETTY STRONG

01:00:54.017 --> 01:00:55.385
GUARDRAILS. I'M NERVOUS ABOUT

01:00:55.451 --> 01:00:57.487
THE MOOD DISORDERS PIECE OF IT,

01:00:57.553 --> 01:00:59.222
BECAUSE IT DOES SEEM LIKE THAT

01:00:59.288 --> 01:01:01.891
IS PRETTY VAGUE TO ME. AND WHEN

01:01:01.958 --> 01:01:03.826
I'M READING THIS AND COULD PICK

01:01:03.893 --> 01:01:05.862
UP A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT SHOULD

01:01:05.928 --> 01:01:07.130
BE IN THE IN THE PROGRAM. SO

01:01:07.196 --> 01:01:09.132
THANK YOU. THANK YOU,

01:01:09.198 --> 01:01:11.934
ASSEMBLYMEMBER PAPIN. GOOD

01:01:12.001 --> 01:01:14.137
MORNING. I WANT TO TELL YOU

01:01:14.203 --> 01:01:15.872
FIRST THAT I AM GOING TO SUPPORT

01:01:15.938 --> 01:01:17.473
THE BILL. AND THE REASON I

01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:20.009
SUPPORT THE BILL IS THAT I THINK

01:01:20.076 --> 01:01:21.511
PEOPLE ARE GETTING A BIT SHORT

01:01:21.577 --> 01:01:23.846
SHRIFTED ON ON THE IDEA THAT

01:01:23.913 --> 01:01:24.914
MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION, THEY'RE

01:01:24.981 --> 01:01:27.650
GETTING TWO FULL YEARS OF IT AND

01:01:27.717 --> 01:01:29.252
IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO PLACE

01:01:29.318 --> 01:01:30.620
SOMEBODY. AND I THINK THE CARE

01:01:30.686 --> 01:01:32.688
COURTS DO IT FASTER. SO I LIKE

01:01:32.755 --> 01:01:34.490
THE IDEA THAT THE BILL IS SORT

01:01:34.557 --> 01:01:36.059
OF LEVERAGING HERE CARE COURTS

01:01:36.125 --> 01:01:36.692
AND GETTING TREATMENT FASTER. I

01:01:36.759 --> 01:01:38.127
KNOW THAT IT'S SHORTER, BUT I'M

01:01:38.194 --> 01:01:41.364
GLAD THAT IT IS FASTER. BUT I

01:01:41.431 --> 01:01:42.832
WAS A LITTLE CONFUSED. I MUST

01:01:42.899 --> 01:01:44.734
TELL YOU ABOUT THIS IDEA OF

01:01:44.801 --> 01:01:45.668
GRADUATION AND WHO THINKS

01:01:45.735 --> 01:01:47.603
THEY'RE READY FOR IT, AND HOW

01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:51.107
THAT INTERACTS WITH A JUDGE'S

01:01:51.174 --> 01:01:56.245
PERCEPTION OF ONE'S. IDEA THAT

01:01:56.312 --> 01:01:57.313
THEY'RE READY FOR GRADUATION. SO

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:58.748
IF YOU COULD JUST ELABORATE ON

01:01:58.815 --> 01:02:01.050
THAT. BUT I LIKE THE IDEA THAT

01:02:01.117 --> 01:02:02.285
THIS IS FASTER TREATMENT AND

01:02:02.351 --> 01:02:03.019
MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION

01:02:03.086 --> 01:02:04.754
OFTENTIMES IS NOT THAT WAY. AND

01:02:04.821 --> 01:02:07.056
WE ARE NOT GETTING PEOPLE 24

01:02:07.123 --> 01:02:08.891
MONTHS. SO I THINK FASTER MIGHT

01:02:08.958 --> 01:02:11.360
BE BETTER THAN PERHAPS A LONGER

01:02:11.427 --> 01:02:14.831
TREATMENT. SO IN TERMS OF

01:02:14.897 --> 01:02:16.699
GRADUATION, ULTIMATELY IT'S THE

01:02:16.766 --> 01:02:18.034
TEAM THAT MAKES THAT

01:02:18.101 --> 01:02:19.135
DETERMINATION, MAKES THE

01:02:19.202 --> 01:02:22.138
RECOMMENDATION TO THE JUDGE WHO

01:02:22.205 --> 01:02:23.473
DECIDES WHETHER SOMEONE IS

01:02:23.539 --> 01:02:25.708
STABLE ENOUGH TO BASICALLY COME

01:02:25.775 --> 01:02:27.243
BACK IN THE COMMUNITY. BUT IT

01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:28.945
DOESN'T MEAN THAT ALL RESOURCES

01:02:29.011 --> 01:02:30.613
STOP AT THAT POINT IN TIME. IT

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:33.116
DOES MEAN THAT THERE IS A WARM

01:02:33.182 --> 01:02:35.618
HANDOFF TO OTHER RESOURCES,

01:02:35.685 --> 01:02:36.619
WHETHER IT'S HOUSING, WHETHER

01:02:36.686 --> 01:02:38.621
IT'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. THIS IS

01:02:38.688 --> 01:02:40.089
A CHALLENGE, AS IS POINTED OUT.

01:02:40.156 --> 01:02:41.724
I MEAN, WE HAVE A HUGE CHALLENGE

01:02:41.791 --> 01:02:43.292
IN TERMS OF TREATMENT OF MENTAL

01:02:43.359 --> 01:02:45.862
ILLNESS IN IN CALIFORNIA. THIS

01:02:45.928 --> 01:02:48.898
IS A SMALL POPULATION. ONE OF

01:02:48.965 --> 01:02:51.634
THE CRITICISMS, WHICH IS

01:02:51.701 --> 01:02:53.102
LEGITIMATE IS THAT THIS HAS NOT

01:02:53.169 --> 01:02:54.237
SERVED, AS MR. HARRIS POINTS

01:02:54.303 --> 01:02:57.673
OUT, THIS IS NOT SERVED A HUGE

01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:59.942
POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA. I

01:03:00.009 --> 01:03:01.410
THINK THAT THE CRITERIA THAT WE

01:03:01.477 --> 01:03:03.412
ARE ADOPTING MOOD DISORDER WITH

01:03:03.479 --> 01:03:05.314
PSYCHOTIC FEATURES, WHO ALSO

01:03:05.381 --> 01:03:06.782
BASICALLY CAN'T TAKE CARE OF

01:03:06.849 --> 01:03:08.451
THEMSELVES IN THE COMMUNITY

01:03:08.518 --> 01:03:10.319
USING ALL THREE OF THOSE

01:03:10.386 --> 01:03:11.921
CRITERIA. IT'S AGAIN, A ALTHOUGH

01:03:11.988 --> 01:03:13.523
IT'S AN EXPANSION, IT'S A

01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:16.392
RELATIVELY SMALL EXPANSION OF

01:03:16.459 --> 01:03:21.430
WHO MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE. THE

01:03:21.497 --> 01:03:25.401
UNDERLYING SORT OF. THE

01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:27.637
UNDERLYING THEORY OF CARE COURT

01:03:27.703 --> 01:03:30.439
IS THAT IT IS VOLUNTARY. SO YOU

01:03:30.506 --> 01:03:32.275
CAN ALWAYS BASICALLY, IN

01:03:32.341 --> 01:03:34.277
ESSENCE, DROP OUT OF CARE COURT

01:03:34.343 --> 01:03:37.380
IF YOU WANT TO. NOW, ONE OF THE

01:03:37.446 --> 01:03:39.282
COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS OF

01:03:39.348 --> 01:03:39.882
SCHIZOPHRENIA, THOSE WHO HAVE

01:03:39.949 --> 01:03:41.250
LIVED EXPERIENCE IN THIS, IN

01:03:41.317 --> 01:03:43.419
THIS SPACE, KNOW THAT

01:03:43.486 --> 01:03:45.288
SCHIZOPHRENICS ARE NOT ALWAYS

01:03:45.354 --> 01:03:47.123
PSYCHOTIC. THERE ARE PERIODS OF

01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:49.559
LUCIDITY, PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE

01:03:49.625 --> 01:03:50.693
RECEIVING MEDICATION, AND AT

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:52.628
THAT POINT IN TIME, YOU CAN MAKE

01:03:52.695 --> 01:03:53.796
DECISIONS. YOU CAN MAKE

01:03:53.863 --> 01:03:55.131
INFORMED, INTELLIGENT DECISIONS

01:03:55.198 --> 01:03:57.433
AS TO WHAT YOU WANT TO BE DONE.

01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:59.202
IF YOU'RE HAVING A PSYCHOTIC

01:03:59.268 --> 01:04:01.003
EPISODE, MEDICATIONS TO BE

01:04:01.070 --> 01:04:02.572
ADMINISTERED, THOSE KINDS OF

01:04:02.638 --> 01:04:03.940
THINGS. AND THAT IS PART OF THE

01:04:04.006 --> 01:04:07.276
CARE COURT PROGRAM, AS YOU POINT

01:04:07.343 --> 01:04:10.646
OUT, IT CAN BE AS LONG AS TWO

01:04:10.713 --> 01:04:11.781
YEARS. IT COULD BE SHORTER AS

01:04:11.847 --> 01:04:13.749
WELL IF YOU'RE STABLE. I DON'T

01:04:13.816 --> 01:04:16.018
KNOW IF, DOCTOR, YOU HAVE ANY

01:04:16.085 --> 01:04:18.020
FURTHER RESPONSE TO THAT. NO, I

01:04:18.087 --> 01:04:20.623
THINK IT'S THE GREAT THING ABOUT

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:23.059
CARE COURT IS IT REALLY IS A

01:04:23.125 --> 01:04:25.728
COLLABORATIVE PROCESS. AND, AND

01:04:25.795 --> 01:04:30.900
I THINK ONE THAT I THINK ONE OF

01:04:30.967 --> 01:04:32.969
THE BENEFITS OF SB 27 ALSO IS

01:04:33.035 --> 01:04:35.338
THE INTRODUCTION OF ADDITIONAL

01:04:35.404 --> 01:04:37.273
REVIEW HEARINGS FOR THE BROAD

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:39.642
MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WITH IN CARE

01:04:39.709 --> 01:04:41.077
COURT HAVE CARE AGREEMENTS

01:04:41.143 --> 01:04:42.845
VERSUS I THINK THERE'S ONLY

01:04:42.912 --> 01:04:44.680
THREE PEOPLE WITH WITH COURT

01:04:44.747 --> 01:04:46.215
ORDERED CARE PLANS. SO I THINK

01:04:46.282 --> 01:04:50.152
THAT SPEAKS TO HOW WELL RECEIVED

01:04:50.219 --> 01:04:52.955
AND WELCOMED I THINK THE CARE

01:04:53.022 --> 01:04:55.291
ACT PROGRAM HAS BEEN IN

01:04:55.358 --> 01:05:03.065
CALIFORNIA. MADAM VICE CHAIR.

01:05:03.132 --> 01:05:04.267
THANK YOU FOR THE ADDITIONAL

01:05:04.333 --> 01:05:08.104
TIME. I, AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:09.472
LEVEL, WHEN I SERVED ON LOCAL

01:05:09.538 --> 01:05:11.674
GOVERNMENT IN ORANGE COUNTY AND

01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:13.276
SEE THAT THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS

01:05:13.342 --> 01:05:16.078
PEOPLE HAS INCREASED. WE HAVE

01:05:16.145 --> 01:05:17.513
AND I'M SURE IT'S TYPICAL FOR

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.649
ALL COUNTIES, AND I KNOW THAT

01:05:19.715 --> 01:05:21.317
I'VE BEEN IN SACRAMENTO FOR

01:05:21.384 --> 01:05:22.918
THREE AND A HALF YEARS NOW, AND

01:05:22.985 --> 01:05:25.021
MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IN

01:05:25.087 --> 01:05:26.455
ENCOUNTERING PEOPLE WHO I THINK

01:05:26.522 --> 01:05:30.826
IN MY AMATEUR, UNPROFESSIONAL

01:05:30.893 --> 01:05:33.062
OBSERVATION, I RUN EVERY MORNING

01:05:33.129 --> 01:05:36.265
AT FIVE FROM 5 TO 6 A.M. AND

01:05:36.332 --> 01:05:38.100
FROM 26TH STREET TO THE CAPITOL

01:05:38.167 --> 01:05:40.803
AND BACK, AND ON K STREET. IT'S

01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:43.706
VERY SAD THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS

01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:46.342
PEOPLE WHO ARE IN TENTS IN OUR

01:05:46.409 --> 01:05:47.810
CAPITAL CITY, AND NOT SO MUCH

01:05:47.877 --> 01:05:49.145
THAT THEY'RE JUST SLEEPING IN

01:05:49.211 --> 01:05:51.681
IT, THEY'RE NOT SLEEPING BETWEEN

01:05:51.747 --> 01:05:53.716
5 AND 6. THEY'RE WAKING UP. AND

01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:55.618
JUST THIS MORNING, AND THIS HAS

01:05:55.685 --> 01:05:56.752
HAPPENED TO ME A COUPLE OF

01:05:56.819 --> 01:05:58.654
TIMES, I HAVEN'T FELT THREATENED

01:05:58.721 --> 01:06:01.023
AND I'M PREPARED FOR THAT. BUT

01:06:01.090 --> 01:06:02.024
PEOPLE HAVE APPROACHED ME.

01:06:02.091 --> 01:06:03.392
THEY'RE WAKING UP AND THEY

01:06:03.459 --> 01:06:08.497
CLEARLY ARE HAVING A MOMENT OF

01:06:08.564 --> 01:06:11.534
MENTAL. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WHAT

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:13.336
IS HAPPENING. I'M NOT A DOCTOR,

01:06:13.402 --> 01:06:15.338
BUT NONETHELESS THEY'RE THEY'RE

01:06:15.404 --> 01:06:16.739
SINGING, THEY'RE TALKING,

01:06:16.806 --> 01:06:19.742
THEY'RE LIGHTING FIRES. THEY

01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:21.844
NEED HELP. AND I THINK THAT IS

01:06:21.911 --> 01:06:24.113
WHY I IN MY FIRST REMARKS, I'M

01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:27.516
I'M A APPRECIATIVE OF WHAT THE

01:06:27.583 --> 01:06:28.884
CARE COURT IS TRYING TO DO, AND

01:06:28.951 --> 01:06:30.619
THAT ONLY 100 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

01:06:30.686 --> 01:06:32.555
HELPED IN THE STATE OF

01:06:32.621 --> 01:06:33.823
CALIFORNIA, TO ME, SAYS WE HAVE

01:06:33.889 --> 01:06:36.258
A LARGER NEED TO ADDRESS THE

01:06:36.325 --> 01:06:37.626
BEHAVIORAL PART OF IT, THE

01:06:37.693 --> 01:06:39.528
HOUSING PART OF IT, THE MENTAL

01:06:39.595 --> 01:06:40.529
FACILITIES. THESE PEOPLE NEED

01:06:40.596 --> 01:06:42.431
HELP. AND FOR WHATEVER REASON,

01:06:42.498 --> 01:06:43.866
THEY'RE NOT GETTING INTO THE

01:06:43.933 --> 01:06:45.701
CARE COURT SYSTEM. I'VE CALLED

01:06:45.768 --> 01:06:47.670
THE POLICE ON SOME OF THE FIRES

01:06:47.737 --> 01:06:48.904
THAT I'VE OBSERVED, AND THE

01:06:48.971 --> 01:06:51.273
POLICE DO NOT COME. AND IT IS

01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:54.276
VERY SAD. AND THEY'RE THEY'RE

01:06:54.343 --> 01:06:55.578
WANDERING OUR STREETS AND

01:06:55.644 --> 01:06:57.780
THEY'RE AND THEY NEED HELP. AND

01:06:57.847 --> 01:06:59.648
HOWEVER WE CAN MOVE THEM IN TO

01:06:59.715 --> 01:07:04.353
SOME PERMANENT FACILITY TO HELP

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:07.189
THEM TREAT THEIR ILLNESS. I

01:07:07.256 --> 01:07:08.624
APPLAUD ANY METHOD. AND I KNOW

01:07:08.691 --> 01:07:10.459
IT'S BIGGER THAN JUST THIS CARE

01:07:10.526 --> 01:07:12.661
COURT, BUT TO CONCENTRATE ON THE

01:07:12.728 --> 01:07:14.463
BEHAVIORAL SIDE AND THE HOUSING

01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:16.031
SIDE, THERE'S JUST A LOT MORE

01:07:16.098 --> 01:07:17.733
THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. AND THIS

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:19.301
IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN THAT

01:07:19.368 --> 01:07:20.102
DIRECTION. THANK YOU, MADAM

01:07:20.169 --> 01:07:21.337
SECRETARY. YOU CAN ESTABLISH

01:07:21.404 --> 01:07:23.472
QUORUM, PLEASE. CHOLERA HERE.

01:07:23.539 --> 01:07:27.076
DIXON. BAUER-KAHAN BRIAN CONLEY.

01:07:27.143 --> 01:07:28.911
GARABEDIAN. MACEDO. PACHECO

01:07:28.978 --> 01:07:32.348
HERE. PAPIN HERE. SANCHEZ. HERE.

01:07:32.415 --> 01:07:35.251
STEPHANIE. ZUBIATE HERE. RIGHT.

01:07:35.317 --> 01:07:37.119
WE'VE ESTABLISHED QUORUM. ANY

01:07:37.186 --> 01:07:42.158
OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS? SO

01:07:42.224 --> 01:07:43.426
I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION

01:07:43.492 --> 01:07:45.628
HERE. AND I THINK THAT AS WAS

01:07:45.694 --> 01:07:46.729
ALLUDED TO, YOU KNOW, I THINK A

01:07:46.796 --> 01:07:48.731
LOT OF FOLKS ARE GETTING UP TO

01:07:48.798 --> 01:07:50.466
SPEED ON WHAT SOME OF THESE

01:07:50.533 --> 01:07:51.934
CHANGES ARE, AND THEY'RE QUITE A

01:07:52.001 --> 01:07:52.968
NUMBER OF THEM. AND AS

01:07:53.035 --> 01:07:54.036
REFERENCED BY OUR COLLEAGUE,

01:07:54.103 --> 01:07:55.304
THIS IS TRIPLE REFERRED. SO IT

01:07:55.371 --> 01:07:56.572
IS GOING TO HEALTH COMMITTEE AS

01:07:56.639 --> 01:07:58.274
WELL AS PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE.

01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:00.009
AND OF COURSE, YOU KNOW, THE

01:08:00.075 --> 01:08:01.177
ORIGINAL RECORD, I FAMOUSLY DID

01:08:01.243 --> 01:08:03.946
NOT SUPPORT IT FOR A LOT OF

01:08:04.013 --> 01:08:04.580
REASONS AND CONCERNS THAT HAVE

01:08:04.647 --> 01:08:06.782
BEEN STATED ALREADY, INCLUDING

01:08:06.849 --> 01:08:09.518
THE RESOURCE ASPECT. AND HAVING

01:08:09.585 --> 01:08:12.388
WORKED FOR MANY, MANY YEARS

01:08:12.455 --> 01:08:12.988
REPRESENTING CLIENTS AND DRUG

01:08:13.055 --> 01:08:14.356
TREATMENT COURT AS A PUBLIC

01:08:14.423 --> 01:08:15.224
DEFENDER AS WELL, THAT, YOU

01:08:15.291 --> 01:08:18.360
KNOW, IN MANY INSTANCES OVERLAP

01:08:18.427 --> 01:08:19.829
WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AS

01:08:19.895 --> 01:08:23.532
WELL. IT'S HARD FOR FOLKS TO

01:08:23.599 --> 01:08:25.801
EXPECT FOLKS TO BE ABLE TO BE

01:08:25.868 --> 01:08:27.470
SUCCESSFUL IN THESE KINDS OF

01:08:27.536 --> 01:08:28.604
PROGRAMS IF THEY DON'T HAVE

01:08:28.671 --> 01:08:29.705
HOUSING, WHICH I THINK IS THE

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:31.006
UNDERLYING ISSUE THAT REALLY

01:08:31.073 --> 01:08:32.141
ADDRESSED THAT. IT'S AN

01:08:32.208 --> 01:08:32.741
UNDERLYING ISSUE FOR SO MANY

01:08:32.808 --> 01:08:34.543
THINGS WE'RE DEALING WITH IN OUR

01:08:34.610 --> 01:08:37.246
STATE. BUT ALSO, YOU KNOW, ONCE

01:08:37.313 --> 01:08:38.747
IT WAS VOTED INTO LAW AND JUST

01:08:38.814 --> 01:08:40.483
LIKE WITH THE COUNTIES AT THE

01:08:40.549 --> 01:08:41.984
TIME, DIDN'T NECESSARILY SUPPORT

01:08:42.051 --> 01:08:44.286
IT, BUT ONCE IT WAS VOTED INTO

01:08:44.353 --> 01:08:45.421
LAW, THEY'RE DOING HEROIC WORK

01:08:45.488 --> 01:08:47.256
TO TRY TO IMPLEMENT IT AS WE'VE

01:08:47.323 --> 01:08:51.727
DIRECTED. AND SO I GIVEN THE

01:08:51.794 --> 01:08:53.796
FACT THAT, YOU KNOW, IT IS

01:08:53.863 --> 01:08:55.998
TRIPLE REFERRED, I DO WANT TO

01:08:56.065 --> 01:08:57.266
GIVE THE CHAIR AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:08:57.333 --> 01:08:58.567
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION

01:08:58.634 --> 01:08:59.969
ON SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE

01:09:00.035 --> 01:09:01.670
BEEN RAISED. A COUPLE THAT WE

01:09:01.737 --> 01:09:03.539
HAVE AS A JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

01:09:03.606 --> 01:09:04.874
HAVE TO DO WITH SOME TECHNICAL

01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:05.908
FIXES, AS WELL AS THE GRADUATION

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:07.409
ASPECT THAT WAS RAISED. AND, YOU

01:09:07.476 --> 01:09:08.611
KNOW, I LOOK FORWARD TO, YOU

01:09:08.677 --> 01:09:09.812
KNOW, OUR STAFF'S ALWAYS WORK

01:09:09.879 --> 01:09:11.714
WELL TOGETHER. SO I LOOK FORWARD

01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:12.715
TO CONTINUING TO WORK ON THAT

01:09:12.781 --> 01:09:14.450
ASPECT OF IT. BUT THE OTHER

01:09:14.517 --> 01:09:16.752
AREAS THAT I HAVE CONCERN ABOUT

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:18.220
INCLUDE WHAT HAS BEEN RAISED

01:09:18.287 --> 01:09:19.121
ALREADY IN TERMS OF MOOD

01:09:19.188 --> 01:09:20.723
DISORDERS, AND THAT'S MORE

01:09:20.789 --> 01:09:22.591
APPROPRIATELY DEALT WITH IN THE

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:23.325
HEALTH COMMITTEE. THEY

01:09:23.392 --> 01:09:23.993
CONSULTANTS WILL HAVE THE

01:09:24.059 --> 01:09:25.861
EXPERTISE TO BETTER ADVISE, I

01:09:25.928 --> 01:09:27.630
THINK, MEMBERS ON SOME OF THE

01:09:27.696 --> 01:09:29.465
QUESTIONS THAT WERE RAISED. AND

01:09:29.532 --> 01:09:31.867
THEN THE OTHER ONE HAS TO DO

01:09:31.934 --> 01:09:34.069
WITH THE ELIGIBILITY AND

01:09:34.136 --> 01:09:35.371
CRITERIA FOR GRANTING DIVERSION

01:09:35.437 --> 01:09:37.373
AND WHAT HAVE YOU. I THINK

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:37.907
THAT'S MORE APPROPRIATELY

01:09:37.973 --> 01:09:39.208
RESOLVED IN THE PUBLIC SAFETY

01:09:39.275 --> 01:09:40.543
COMMITTEE. AND SO I WANT TO GIVE

01:09:40.609 --> 01:09:41.744
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO WORK

01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:42.745
WITH THOSE COMMITTEES, THOSE

01:09:42.811 --> 01:09:45.047
CHAIRS, THOSE CONSULTANTS, TO

01:09:45.114 --> 01:09:46.015
DEAL WITH THOSE ISSUES AND TO

01:09:46.081 --> 01:09:47.516
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION

01:09:47.583 --> 01:09:49.585
ON SOME OF THOSE ISSUES. THE

01:09:49.652 --> 01:09:50.586
RESOURCE ISSUE IS ALWAYS GOING

01:09:50.653 --> 01:09:52.555
TO BE AN ISSUE, I THINK, WHEN IT

01:09:52.621 --> 01:09:53.556
COMES TO THIS. AND I THINK

01:09:53.622 --> 01:09:55.724
THAT'S THE OTHER QUESTION THAT

01:09:55.791 --> 01:09:56.992
WAS RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS IS

01:09:57.059 --> 01:09:58.460
JUST HOW MUCH MONEY IS BEING

01:09:58.527 --> 01:10:00.062
SPENT IN THIS PROGRAM. AND I

01:10:00.129 --> 01:10:00.930
MEAN, IT'S ULTIMATELY, I THINK,

01:10:00.996 --> 01:10:02.598
A BOTH PHILOSOPHICAL AND

01:10:02.665 --> 01:10:03.465
PRACTICAL QUESTION OF WHETHER

01:10:03.532 --> 01:10:04.867
IT'S WORTH IT OR NOT. AND I

01:10:04.934 --> 01:10:06.502
THINK THAT YOUR EFFORTS ARE

01:10:06.569 --> 01:10:08.237
TRYING TO MAKE IT WORTH IT BY

01:10:08.304 --> 01:10:09.772
GETTING THE RIGHT PEOPLE INTO

01:10:09.838 --> 01:10:11.073
THE PROGRAM. AND SO I UNDERSTAND

01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:14.176
THAT AND RESPECT THAT. AND SO I

01:10:14.243 --> 01:10:16.512
DO HAVE AN AI RECOMMENDATION

01:10:16.579 --> 01:10:17.813
TODAY TO ALLOW YOU THE

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.815
OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO WORK

01:10:19.882 --> 01:10:21.617
ON SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT

01:10:21.684 --> 01:10:22.785
HAVE BEEN RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS

01:10:22.851 --> 01:10:24.119
AND BY THE OPPOSITION, AND SOME

01:10:24.186 --> 01:10:25.521
OF THE QUESTIONS THAT THE

01:10:25.588 --> 01:10:26.622
MEMBERS HAVE BROUGHT FORTH. AS

01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:28.190
YOU MOVE ON, IF THIS DOES PASS

01:10:28.257 --> 01:10:29.925
ON TO HEALTH COMMITTEE, I THINK

01:10:29.992 --> 01:10:31.694
THAT THAT THAT COMMITTEE IN

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:32.828
PARTICULAR IS GOING TO BE ABLE

01:10:32.895 --> 01:10:34.363
TO DIVE A LITTLE DEEPER INTO

01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:35.564
SOME OF THE AREAS OF MOST

01:10:35.631 --> 01:10:37.366
CONCERN THAT FOLKS MIGHT HAVE.

01:10:37.433 --> 01:10:38.467
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE? WELL,

01:10:38.534 --> 01:10:39.802
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. YES, YOU

01:10:39.868 --> 01:10:40.869
ARE RIGHT. THIS IS TRIPLE

01:10:40.936 --> 01:10:43.272
REFERRED. THIS IS THE THIRD YEAR

01:10:43.339 --> 01:10:44.640
WE'VE HAD A CARE COURT BILL

01:10:44.707 --> 01:10:45.674
BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE, AND I

01:10:45.741 --> 01:10:47.476
EXPECT THAT NEXT YEAR WE'LL HAVE

01:10:47.543 --> 01:10:48.777
ANOTHER CARE COURT BILL IN FRONT

01:10:48.844 --> 01:10:50.913
OF THIS COMMITTEE, BECAUSE THIS

01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:52.715
IS A NEW DYNAMIC. IT'S EVOLVING.

01:10:52.781 --> 01:10:54.416
I APPRECIATE THE STAKEHOLDERS.

01:10:54.483 --> 01:10:55.751
STAKEHOLDERS HAVE BEEN MOST

01:10:55.818 --> 01:10:57.586
HELPFUL, WHETHER IT'S THE

01:10:57.653 --> 01:10:59.655
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SPECIALISTS,

01:10:59.722 --> 01:11:01.890
COUNTY OFFICIALS OR DISABILITY

01:11:01.957 --> 01:11:05.160
COMMUNITY TO IMPROVE THE CARE

01:11:05.227 --> 01:11:08.831
COURT PROCESS. I THINK THERE ARE

01:11:08.897 --> 01:11:10.699
MORE THAN 100. IN FACT, I KNOW

01:11:10.766 --> 01:11:11.867
THAT THERE ARE MORE THAN 100

01:11:11.934 --> 01:11:14.203
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN

01:11:14.269 --> 01:11:15.804
CARE COURT OVER THE LAST YEAR.

01:11:15.871 --> 01:11:17.272
IT IS NEW. MOST COUNTIES IN

01:11:17.339 --> 01:11:19.208
CALIFORNIA JUST BEGAN LAST

01:11:19.274 --> 01:11:23.479
DECEMBER, AND IT IS. IT IS

01:11:23.545 --> 01:11:25.881
EXPANDING IN THE SENSE THAT

01:11:25.948 --> 01:11:26.515
THERE ARE MORE AND MORE PEOPLE

01:11:26.582 --> 01:11:28.350
WHO ARE ENGAGED IN CARE COURT.

01:11:28.417 --> 01:11:30.486
WE AGAIN, WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED

01:11:30.552 --> 01:11:32.488
ENOUGH SUPPORT TO THOSE WHO ARE

01:11:32.554 --> 01:11:34.056
MENTALLY ILL IN CALIFORNIA. AND

01:11:34.123 --> 01:11:36.792
THIS IS WHILE IT'S AN IMPORTANT

01:11:36.859 --> 01:11:39.161
EFFORT, IT'S NOT A PANACEA FOR

01:11:39.228 --> 01:11:40.629
ALL THOSE WHO ARE MENTALLY ILL.

01:11:40.696 --> 01:11:41.764
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT

01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:43.732
WHAT THE ALTERNATIVE IS. SO, FOR

01:11:43.799 --> 01:11:45.834
EXAMPLE, WHEN WE'RE TALKING

01:11:45.901 --> 01:11:46.468
ABOUT MISDEMEANOR MISDEMEANORS

01:11:46.535 --> 01:11:48.337
WHO ARE DEEMED TO BE INCOMPETENT

01:11:48.404 --> 01:11:49.371
TO STAND TRIAL, HERE'S WHAT

01:11:49.438 --> 01:11:52.307
HAPPENS. YOU YOU KNOW, YOU

01:11:52.374 --> 01:11:54.176
COMMIT A MISDEMEANOR, YOU

01:11:54.243 --> 01:11:55.978
VANDALIZED SOME PROPERTY OR YOU

01:11:56.045 --> 01:11:57.646
SHOPLIFT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

01:11:57.713 --> 01:11:59.915
AND YOU'RE CLEARLY HAVE A

01:11:59.982 --> 01:12:01.183
PSYCHOTIC DISORDER, SO YOU'RE

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:02.818
NOT COMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL. SO

01:12:02.885 --> 01:12:04.787
WHAT DO YOU DO? WELL, YOU JUST

01:12:04.853 --> 01:12:06.555
RIGHT NOW, WE JUST RELEASE IT.

01:12:06.622 --> 01:12:07.790
GO AHEAD. PLEASE DON'T STEAL

01:12:07.856 --> 01:12:08.724
ANYMORE. PLEASE DON'T VANDALIZE

01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:09.892
ANYMORE. AND PLEASE DO GET WELL.

01:12:09.958 --> 01:12:11.760
PLEASE DO WHATEVER YOU CAN TO

01:12:11.827 --> 01:12:13.262
GET WELL. BUT THIS BILL DOES

01:12:13.328 --> 01:12:13.896
THIS MODIFICATION SAYS NOW YOU

CAN BE REFERRED TO CARE COURT.

01:12:16.265 --> 01:12:17.599
SO YOU ACTUALLY GET WELL. AND IT

01:12:17.666 --> 01:12:19.568
HAS BENEFITS OBVIOUSLY FOR THE

01:12:19.635 --> 01:12:20.302
INDIVIDUAL AND FOR THE FAMILY.

01:12:20.369 --> 01:12:21.437
IT ALSO HAS PUBLIC SAFETY

01:12:21.503 --> 01:12:23.706
COMMUNITY BENEFITS. AND SO I

01:12:23.772 --> 01:12:24.907
APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU'VE

01:12:24.973 --> 01:12:26.375
DONE, MR. CHAIR, AND I

01:12:26.442 --> 01:12:27.176
APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:12:27.242 --> 01:12:28.844
CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS. SO

01:12:28.911 --> 01:12:31.346
WITH THAT, I URGE AND I VOTE WE

01:12:31.413 --> 01:12:32.781
DO NEED A MOTION. WE HAVE A

01:12:32.848 --> 01:12:34.383

01:12:36.618 --> 01:12:37.986
MADAM SECRETARY WILL TAKE ROLL

01:12:38.053 --> 01:12:38.954
CALL. VOTE ON SB 27, PLEASE.

01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:39.988

CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE TO HAVE

01:13:00.809 --> 01:13:04.747
SB 82 HEARD AS WELL. YEAH. ITEM

01:13:04.813 --> 01:13:14.289
FOR SB 82. SB 82 IS A BILL THAT.

01:13:14.356 --> 01:13:19.261
WAS, IN ESSENCE, THAT WAS

01:13:19.328 --> 01:13:20.729
INSPIRED BY AN EVENT THAT

01:13:20.796 --> 01:13:22.931
HAPPENED WITH RESPECT TO AN

01:13:22.998 --> 01:13:24.833
INDIVIDUAL WHO SIGNED UP FOR

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:27.336
STREAMING SERVICE AND THEN FOUND

01:13:27.402 --> 01:13:29.805
THEMSELVES BASICALLY COMMITTED

01:13:29.872 --> 01:13:31.707
TO ARBITRATION FOR ALL ACTS

01:13:31.774 --> 01:13:34.209
WHERE THE STREAMING SERVICE

01:13:34.276 --> 01:13:36.245
PARENT COMPANY MAY BE A

01:13:36.311 --> 01:13:38.447
DEFENDANT. SO IF YOU SIGN UP FOR

01:13:38.514 --> 01:13:41.283
FILL IN THE BLANK PLATFORM TO BE

01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:44.520
ABLE TO WATCH MOVIES AT HOME,

01:13:44.586 --> 01:13:47.055
AND A YEAR LATER, YOU'RE DRIVING

01:13:47.122 --> 01:13:48.524
DOWN THE STREET AND A TRUCK HITS

01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:50.893
YOU FROM THAT SAME SERVICE, AND

01:13:50.959 --> 01:13:52.661
THE ENTITY SAYS, YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:13:52.728 --> 01:13:53.962
YOU'VE SIGNED UP FOR

01:13:54.029 --> 01:13:55.731
ARBITRATION. AND THEY SAY YOU

01:13:55.798 --> 01:13:57.266
DON'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO

01:13:57.332 --> 01:13:58.500
TO COURT. AND WHAT THIS DOES IS

01:13:58.567 --> 01:14:00.335
IT SIMPLY SAYS THAT IT'S

01:14:00.402 --> 01:14:02.171
BASICALLY WITHIN THE SCOPE OF

01:14:02.237 --> 01:14:03.605
WHAT YOU INTENDED TO SIGN UP

01:14:03.672 --> 01:14:05.374
FOR. IT'S A RELATIVELY SIMPLE

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:07.843
BILL. I WANT TO THANK MANUELA

01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:09.711
BOUCHER FOR YOUR HELP IN

01:14:09.778 --> 01:14:12.748
REFINING THIS BILL. I HAVE

01:14:12.815 --> 01:14:14.550
SABINA TAKHAR WITH THE

01:14:14.616 --> 01:14:15.884
CALIFORNIA, WITH THE CONSUMER

01:14:15.951 --> 01:14:16.952
ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA AND

01:14:17.019 --> 01:14:18.120
PROFESSOR DAVID HORTON FROM THE

01:14:18.187 --> 01:14:19.822
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, DAVIS

01:14:19.888 --> 01:14:23.792
SCHOOL OF LAW. THANK YOU. GOOD

01:14:23.859 --> 01:14:24.827
MORNING, CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I'M

01:14:24.893 --> 01:14:26.094
DAVID HORTON, I'M MARTIN LUTHER

01:14:26.161 --> 01:14:27.830
KING JUNIOR PROFESSOR OF LAW AT

01:14:27.896 --> 01:14:29.264
UC DAVIS. I'VE WRITTEN

01:14:29.331 --> 01:14:30.098
EXTENSIVELY ABOUT THIS PROBLEM

01:14:30.165 --> 01:14:31.567
OF INFINITE ARBITRATION CLAUSES.

01:14:31.633 --> 01:14:32.968
IN FACT, AT THE RISK OF

01:14:33.035 --> 01:14:34.369
BRAGGING, I COINED THE TERM

01:14:34.436 --> 01:14:35.671
INFINITE ARBITRATION CLAUSES ARE

01:14:35.737 --> 01:14:36.905
SERIOUSLY PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE

01:14:36.972 --> 01:14:38.473
THEY DEFY CONSUMERS EXPECTATIONS

01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:40.542
AND CAUSE ABSURD RESULTS. LET ME

01:14:40.609 --> 01:14:42.311
GIVE YOU A SIMPLE EXAMPLE. SAY

01:14:42.377 --> 01:14:43.979
YOU HAVE AN IPHONE THAT RUNS ON

01:14:44.046 --> 01:14:46.114
AT&amp;T MOBILITY'S NETWORK. WHEN

01:14:46.181 --> 01:14:47.549
YOU ACCEPTED MOBILITY'S TERMS

01:14:47.616 --> 01:14:49.351
AND CONDITIONS, YOU ALSO AGREED

01:14:49.418 --> 01:14:50.452
TO ARBITRATE ANY DISPUTE YOU

01:14:50.519 --> 01:14:52.120
WILL EVER HAVE WITH ANY MEMBER

01:14:52.187 --> 01:14:53.755
OF MOBILITY'S CORPORATE FAMILY,

01:14:53.822 --> 01:14:55.891
INCLUDING AT&amp;T, FOR THE REST OF

01:14:55.958 --> 01:14:57.659
YOUR LIFE, CONSIDER WHAT THAT

01:14:57.726 --> 01:14:58.927
MEANS. SUPPOSE YOU'RE CROSSING

01:14:58.994 --> 01:15:00.295
AN INTERSECTION AND A MOBILITY

01:15:00.362 --> 01:15:01.964
VAN HITS YOU. YOUR TORT CLAIM

01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:03.966
HAS TO GO TO ARBITRATION, OR YOU

01:15:04.032 --> 01:15:05.834
HEAR A FALSE STATEMENT BY A

01:15:05.901 --> 01:15:06.702
MOBILITY EXECUTIVE AND YOU BUY

01:15:06.768 --> 01:15:08.370
MOBILITY STOCK. YOUR SECURITIES

01:15:08.437 --> 01:15:10.305
FRAUD CLAIM HAS TO GO TO

01:15:10.372 --> 01:15:12.007
ARBITRATION OR MOBILITY.

01:15:12.074 --> 01:15:13.876
AFFILIATE DIRECTV MAKES

01:15:13.942 --> 01:15:15.711
OBNOXIOUS ROBOCALLS TO YOUR

01:15:15.777 --> 01:15:17.045
LANDLINE. YOUR TELEPHONE

01:15:17.112 --> 01:15:18.247
CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT CLAIM

01:15:18.313 --> 01:15:20.349
HAS TO GO TO ARBITRATION, EVEN

01:15:20.415 --> 01:15:22.150
THOUGH THERE'S NO CONTRACT

01:15:22.217 --> 01:15:23.919
WHATSOEVER BETWEEN YOU AND

01:15:23.986 --> 01:15:26.054
DIRECTV. INFINITE ARBITRATION

01:15:26.121 --> 01:15:27.689
CLAUSES ARE LESS A KIND OF

01:15:27.756 --> 01:15:29.258
CONTRACTUAL TERM AND MORE AN

01:15:29.324 --> 01:15:31.426
ARBITRATION SERVITUDE. SB 82

01:15:31.493 --> 01:15:32.828
OFFERS AN ELEGANT SOLUTION TO

01:15:32.895 --> 01:15:34.363
THIS PROBLEM. IT REQUIRES

01:15:34.429 --> 01:15:35.831
DISPUTE RESOLUTION TERMS IN A

01:15:35.898 --> 01:15:37.232
CONSUMER CONTRACT TO PERTAIN

01:15:37.299 --> 01:15:39.434
ONLY TO THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE

01:15:39.501 --> 01:15:41.169
PROVIDED. AS A RESULT, IT WOULD

01:15:41.236 --> 01:15:41.837
PREVENT COMPANIES FROM

01:15:41.904 --> 01:15:44.339
COMPELLING ARBITRATION IN

01:15:44.406 --> 01:15:46.642
SURPRISING AND BIZARRE WAYS. IN

01:15:46.708 --> 01:15:47.976
ADDITION, ALTHOUGH THE FEDERAL

01:15:48.043 --> 01:15:49.411
ARBITRATION ACT OFTEN PREEMPTS

01:15:49.478 --> 01:15:50.913
STATE REGULATION OF ARBITRATION,

01:15:50.979 --> 01:15:53.115
IT DOESN'T DO SO HERE. AND TO

01:15:53.181 --> 01:15:55.517
SEE WHY YOU DON'T NEED TO LOOK

01:15:55.584 --> 01:15:57.753
BEYOND THE TEXT OF THE FAA. ITS

01:15:57.819 --> 01:15:59.454
CENTERPIECE, SECTION TWO, ONLY

01:15:59.521 --> 01:16:01.723
APPLIES TO EFFORTS TO COMPEL

01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:02.291
ARBITRATION OF CONTROVERSIES

01:16:02.357 --> 01:16:05.127
THAT ARISE OUT OF THE CONTRACT

01:16:05.193 --> 01:16:07.062
WITH THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE. AS

01:16:07.129 --> 01:16:09.298
A RESULT, A GROWING NUMBER OF

01:16:09.364 --> 01:16:11.099
COURTS, INCLUDING THE US COURT

01:16:11.166 --> 01:16:12.100
OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND,

01:16:12.167 --> 01:16:14.336
NINTH, AND 11TH CIRCUITS HAVE

01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:16.171
RECOGNIZED THAT THE FAA DOESN'T

01:16:16.238 --> 01:16:17.940
APPLY AT ALL UNLESS THERE'S SOME

01:16:18.006 --> 01:16:19.341
NEXUS BETWEEN A PLAINTIFF'S

01:16:19.408 --> 01:16:21.209
CLAIM AND THE CONTRACT WITH THE

01:16:21.276 --> 01:16:23.078
ARBITRATION CLAUSE. STATES CAN

01:16:23.145 --> 01:16:25.547
FILL THIS GAP IN THE FAA. AND

01:16:25.614 --> 01:16:28.050
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SB 82 DOES.

01:16:28.116 --> 01:16:30.319
THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING, MISTER

01:16:30.385 --> 01:16:31.687
CHAIR MEMBERS SABINA TUCKER WITH

01:16:31.753 --> 01:16:33.055
THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF

01:16:33.121 --> 01:16:34.456
CALIFORNIA, A PROUD CO-SPONSOR,

01:16:34.523 --> 01:16:35.891
ALONG WITH CONSUMER FEDERATION

01:16:35.958 --> 01:16:37.292
OF CALIFORNIA AND CONSUMER

01:16:37.359 --> 01:16:39.761
WATCHDOG SB 82, ADDRESSES AN

01:16:39.828 --> 01:16:40.963
INCREASINGLY COMMON AND DEEPLY

01:16:41.029 --> 01:16:42.331
UNJUST PROBLEM THE USE OF

01:16:42.397 --> 01:16:44.132
ARBITRATION CLAUSES. THESE

01:16:44.199 --> 01:16:45.300
CLAUSES ARE SO BROAD AS

01:16:45.367 --> 01:16:46.802
DESCRIBED HERE, AND TO BE CLEAR,

01:16:46.868 --> 01:16:48.337
THIS BILL DOES NOT BAN

01:16:48.403 --> 01:16:49.171
ARBITRATION. AS A PROFESSOR

01:16:49.237 --> 01:16:50.806
SAID, IT SIMPLY ENSURES THAT IT

01:16:50.872 --> 01:16:52.374
ONLY APPLIES TO THE TRANSACTION

01:16:52.441 --> 01:16:53.942
BETWEEN THE CONSUMER AND THE

01:16:54.009 --> 01:16:55.410
BUSINESS THEY AGREED TO. BUT

01:16:55.477 --> 01:16:56.778
WE'VE SEEN REAL HARM IN THESE

01:16:56.845 --> 01:16:58.447
CLAUSES. YOU JUST HEARD ABOUT

01:16:58.513 --> 01:16:59.681
THE DISNEY CASE. THERE'S ALSO A

01:16:59.748 --> 01:17:01.550
CASE WHERE A COUPLE WAS HIT BY

01:17:01.616 --> 01:17:03.352
AN UBER. THEIR DAUGHTER HAD AN

01:17:03.418 --> 01:17:03.986
UBER EATS ACCOUNT. THEY WERE

01:17:04.052 --> 01:17:05.454
FORCED INTO ARBITRATION. THERE

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:08.123
IS AN ISSUE WITH THE BOY WHO WAS

01:17:08.190 --> 01:17:09.491
HURT ON A DEFECTIVE DIVING BOARD

01:17:09.558 --> 01:17:10.993
AT AIRBNB WASN'T HIS AIRBNB, BUT

01:17:11.059 --> 01:17:12.294
HE WAS FORCED INTO ARBITRATION

01:17:12.361 --> 01:17:13.795
FOR HIS CLAIM. WE SAW THIS IN

01:17:13.862 --> 01:17:15.497
THE WELLS FARGO CASE WHERE THERE

01:17:15.564 --> 01:17:16.798
IS FAKE ACCOUNTS. THEY WERE

01:17:16.865 --> 01:17:17.766
FORCED INTO ARBITRATION EVEN

01:17:17.833 --> 01:17:18.867
THOUGH THEY DIDN'T SIGN UP FOR

01:17:18.934 --> 01:17:21.103
THOSE ACCOUNTS. SO THIS IS A

01:17:21.169 --> 01:17:22.070
VERY SIMPLE BUT IMPORTANT

01:17:22.137 --> 01:17:23.472
MEASURE. WE URGE YOUR AYE VOTE.

01:17:23.538 --> 01:17:25.607
THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE

01:17:25.674 --> 01:17:32.047
HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB 82? GOOD

01:17:32.114 --> 01:17:33.181

01:17:39.588 --> 01:17:42.824
THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING,

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:33.075
MORNING, MR. CHAIR AND MEMBERS.

01:18:33.141 --> 01:18:36.645
SENATOR LUNDBERG AS. SORRY AS

01:18:36.711 --> 01:18:38.313
THE SENATOR IS AWARE, FROM THE

01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:39.915
FIRST CONVERSATION WE HAD ABOUT

01:18:39.981 --> 01:18:43.418
THE BILL, THERE ARE SOME CASES

01:18:43.485 --> 01:18:47.022
IN WHICH HIS CONCERNS ARE

01:18:47.089 --> 01:18:48.390
LEGITIMATE, AND WE'RE HOPING TO

01:18:48.457 --> 01:18:50.859
COME TO SOME RESOLUTION IN TERMS

01:18:50.926 --> 01:18:53.261
OF ADDRESSING THIS, I WOULD ALSO

01:18:53.328 --> 01:18:54.663
OH, I'M SORRY. CHRIS MICHELI, ON

01:18:54.729 --> 01:18:56.398
BEHALF OF THE CIVIL JUSTICE

01:18:56.465 --> 01:18:57.732
ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA, I

01:18:57.799 --> 01:18:59.367
ALSO WANT TO COMPLIMENT THE

01:18:59.434 --> 01:19:00.969
STAFF COUNSEL'S ANALYSIS OF THE

01:19:01.036 --> 01:19:03.538
BILL, GETTING TO THE LANGUAGE

01:19:03.605 --> 01:19:05.740
ITSELF. WE HAVE A COUPLE OF

01:19:05.807 --> 01:19:07.576
CONCERNS. WE THINK THAT THE

01:19:07.642 --> 01:19:09.377
LANGUAGE IS TOO RESTRICTIVE. WE

01:19:09.444 --> 01:19:11.113
UNDERSTAND THE PURPOSE AND

01:19:11.179 --> 01:19:13.248
INTENT AS OUTLINED BY THE AUTHOR

01:19:13.315 --> 01:19:15.784
AND THE SPONSORS. WE THINK THAT

01:19:15.851 --> 01:19:17.652
THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE SOME

01:19:17.719 --> 01:19:20.122
REASONABLY RELATED TRANSACTIONS

01:19:20.188 --> 01:19:21.990
WILL BE CAUGHT UP IN THIS, AND

01:19:22.057 --> 01:19:24.159
THEREFORE WILL BE SUBJECT TO

01:19:24.226 --> 01:19:25.293
LITIGATION. WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:26.962
THAT THERE COULD LEAVE THIS. THE

01:19:27.028 --> 01:19:28.663
CURRENT LANGUAGE COULD LEAD TO,

01:19:28.730 --> 01:19:30.332
IF YOU WILL, EXCESSIVE

01:19:30.398 --> 01:19:32.033
CONTRACTING BETWEEN A CONSUMER

01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:36.271
AND A BUSINESS, FOR EXAMPLE. FOR

01:19:36.338 --> 01:19:38.039
EXAMPLE, IF YOU BOUGHT TICKETS

01:19:38.106 --> 01:19:39.641
TO THE OPERA OR SOMETHING AND

01:19:39.708 --> 01:19:42.077
YOU HAD A SLIP AND FALL AT THE

01:19:42.144 --> 01:19:43.612
OPERA HOUSE, IS THAT COVERED OR

01:19:43.678 --> 01:19:45.981
NOT COVERED, FOR EXAMPLE? THE

01:19:46.047 --> 01:19:47.816
SECOND THING IS, IN THE EARLIER

01:19:47.883 --> 01:19:49.651
ITERATION OF THE BILL, IT

01:19:49.718 --> 01:19:50.819
APPLIED TO CONTRACTS ENTERED

01:19:50.886 --> 01:19:53.622
INTO ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1ST,

01:19:53.688 --> 01:19:55.290
2026. THAT LANGUAGE IS NO LONGER

01:19:55.357 --> 01:19:57.492
HERE. WE WOULD LIKE EXPLICIT

01:19:57.559 --> 01:19:58.760
PROVISION THAT IT'S TO BE

01:19:58.827 --> 01:20:01.897
APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY ONLY. AND

01:20:01.963 --> 01:20:04.332
THEN THE SUBDIVISION D, I THINK

01:20:04.399 --> 01:20:05.800
IN THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE

01:20:05.867 --> 01:20:07.269
BILL, TALKS ABOUT BEING

01:20:07.335 --> 01:20:08.770
LIBERALLY CONSTRUED IN FAVOR OF

01:20:08.837 --> 01:20:10.505
THE CONSUMER. WE THINK THAT

01:20:10.572 --> 01:20:12.574
PROVISION SHOULD BE STRUCK OUT

01:20:12.641 --> 01:20:15.110
BECAUSE ARBITRATION IS

01:20:15.177 --> 01:20:16.611
BENEFICIAL TO BOTH PARTIES, AND

01:20:16.678 --> 01:20:18.813
THEY SHOULD BE ON EQUAL FOOTING

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:20.849
WITH THAT. WE RESPECTFULLY

01:20:20.916 --> 01:20:22.484
OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. THANK

01:20:22.551 --> 01:20:25.353
YOU. THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE

01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:27.355
ELSE HERE IN OPPOSITION TO SB

01:20:27.422 --> 01:20:32.827
82? CHRIS SCHULTZ WITH THE

01:20:32.894 --> 01:20:34.162

OURSELVES WITH THE COMMENTS OF

THANK YOU. JACOB BRANT WITH THE

01:20:39.634 --> 01:20:41.903

01:20:42.938 --> 01:20:46.141
YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS,

01:20:46.208 --> 01:20:47.676
CARLOS GUTIERREZ, ON BEHALF OF

01:20:47.742 --> 01:20:48.343
THE CALIFORNIA GROCERS

01:20:48.410 --> 01:20:49.277
ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU. THANK

01:20:49.344 --> 01:20:50.912
YOU. ALL RIGHT. I'LL BRING IT

01:20:50.979 --> 01:20:52.681
BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY

01:20:52.747 --> 01:20:55.483
QUESTIONS, COMMENTS OR MOTIONS.

01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:57.352
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARABEDIAN THANK

01:20:57.419 --> 01:20:58.820
YOU, MR. CHAIR. I WANT TO THANK

01:20:58.887 --> 01:21:01.022
THE AUTHOR. I WANT TO THANK THE

01:21:01.089 --> 01:21:02.757
OPPOSITION. I THINK THAT THIS IS

01:21:02.824 --> 01:21:04.426
A GOOD BILL. IN MY EXPERIENCE,

01:21:04.492 --> 01:21:07.862
THERE THERE HAVE BEEN JUST, I

01:21:07.929 --> 01:21:09.464
THINK, A PROLIFERATION OF

01:21:09.531 --> 01:21:11.399
ARBITRATION CLAUSES THAT HAVE

01:21:11.466 --> 01:21:14.236
FORCED PRACTICING ATTORNEYS INTO

01:21:14.302 --> 01:21:15.704
ARBITRATIONS WHEN I DON'T THINK

01:21:15.770 --> 01:21:17.872
YOU WOULD HAVE IMAGINED HAVING

01:21:17.939 --> 01:21:19.040
TO ARBITRATE THOSE TYPES OF

01:21:19.107 --> 01:21:21.776
CLAIMS. I DO THINK THAT,

01:21:21.843 --> 01:21:23.612
HOWEVER, THE OPPOSITION HAS A

01:21:23.678 --> 01:21:24.746
GOOD ARGUMENT ABOUT THE

01:21:24.813 --> 01:21:26.948
RETROACTIVITY. SO WHERE ARE YOU

01:21:27.015 --> 01:21:28.817
ON THAT ISSUE AND HAS THAT BEEN

01:21:28.883 --> 01:21:30.085
RESOLVED HERE, OR IS THAT STILL

01:21:30.151 --> 01:21:31.886
SOMETHING THAT THAT YOU'RE

01:21:31.953 --> 01:21:33.655
CONSIDERING? I THINK EXISTING

01:21:33.722 --> 01:21:35.824
LAW TAKES CARE OF THAT. I MEAN,

01:21:35.890 --> 01:21:38.026
UNLESS WE SOMEHOW SPECIFICALLY

01:21:38.093 --> 01:21:40.161
SAY THAT IT'S RETROACTIVE, IT'S

01:21:40.228 --> 01:21:43.198
NOT RETROACTIVE TO THE EXTENT

01:21:43.265 --> 01:21:45.900
THAT WE NEED TO BASICALLY

01:21:45.967 --> 01:21:48.370
RECODIFY EXISTING LAW, WE'LL

01:21:48.436 --> 01:21:52.040
CONSIDER THAT. BUT CLEARLY, IF

01:21:52.107 --> 01:21:53.408
YOU'VE ENTERED INTO AN

01:21:53.475 --> 01:21:55.377
ARBITRATION AGREEMENT A COUPLE

01:21:55.443 --> 01:21:58.446
OF YEARS AGO, WE CAN'T VOID

01:21:58.513 --> 01:22:01.416
SOMETHING UNLESS WE SPECIFICALLY

01:22:01.483 --> 01:22:03.985
SAY THIS IS RETROACTIVE. SO

01:22:04.052 --> 01:22:06.021
WE'LL WE'LL WORK WITH PROFESSOR

01:22:06.087 --> 01:22:08.523
MICHELI TO CONTINUE TO SEE IF WE

01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:11.126
CAN FURTHER DEFINE TERMS. BUT I

01:22:11.192 --> 01:22:12.560
THINK I THINK EXISTING LAW TAKES

01:22:12.627 --> 01:22:14.996
CARE OF THAT. OKAY, I'LL MOVE

01:22:15.063 --> 01:22:16.898
THE BILL. JUST WOULD LOVE TO SEE

01:22:16.965 --> 01:22:18.967
YOU CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT. IS

01:22:19.034 --> 01:22:21.036
THERE A SECOND SECOND? ANY OTHER

01:22:21.102 --> 01:22:21.836
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS?

01:22:21.903 --> 01:22:24.105
ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S I ALSO THINK

01:22:24.172 --> 01:22:25.507
THIS IS A GOOD BILL. I'M

01:22:25.573 --> 01:22:28.843
ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED

01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:30.578
THAT IT WOULDN'T BE RETROACTIVE

01:22:30.645 --> 01:22:32.314
IF WE HAVE ALL THESE ARBITRATION

01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:33.448
CLAUSES SORT OF EMBEDDED IN

01:22:33.515 --> 01:22:35.684
THESE CONTRACTS, AND I KNOW HOW

01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:36.484
MANY TIMES I'VE CLICKED ON

01:22:36.551 --> 01:22:37.686
SOMETHING THAT I HAVEN'T READ

01:22:37.752 --> 01:22:39.187
BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO GET TO THE

01:22:39.254 --> 01:22:41.389
WEBSITE OR WHATEVER IT IS. SO I

01:22:41.456 --> 01:22:42.657
ACTUALLY THINK THIS IS A GOOD

01:22:42.724 --> 01:22:45.694
BILL. I'M I ASSUME THAT I'M JUST

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:47.062
SORT OF READING THIS, THAT IT

01:22:47.128 --> 01:22:50.699
SORT OF THE BILL'S EFFECT

01:22:50.765 --> 01:22:52.067
HAPPENS JUST GENERALLY BY

01:22:52.133 --> 01:22:53.635
OPERATION OF LAW GOING FORWARD.

01:22:53.702 --> 01:22:54.969
RIGHT? IF SO, YOU'VE ACTUALLY

01:22:55.036 --> 01:22:56.438
HAVE ONE OF THESE ARBITRATION

01:22:56.504 --> 01:22:58.239
AGREEMENTS IS EMBEDDED IN

01:22:58.306 --> 01:23:00.041
SOMETHING. IF IT'S THERE, IT'S

01:23:00.108 --> 01:23:00.742
JUST AUTOMATICALLY NULL AND

01:23:00.809 --> 01:23:02.577
VOID. THE COURT WOULD MAKE THAT

01:23:02.644 --> 01:23:04.612
DETERMINATION IN A CONTRACT

01:23:04.679 --> 01:23:07.849
DISPUTE. WELL. I MEAN, IN A, IN

01:23:07.916 --> 01:23:10.285
A, IN A IN A CASE BROUGHT BEFORE

01:23:10.352 --> 01:23:11.920
THE COURT. YEAH. YOU KNOW, I

01:23:11.986 --> 01:23:13.488
SHOULD PROBABLY TURN TO THE

01:23:13.555 --> 01:23:15.390
PROFESSOR HERE, BUT BUT I THINK

01:23:15.457 --> 01:23:18.226
IT MAY BE ON A CASE BY CASE

01:23:18.293 --> 01:23:21.162
BASIS SO AS TO, AS TO WHETHER OR

01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:23.031
NOT IT WOULD APPLY OR NOT APPLY.

01:23:23.098 --> 01:23:26.534
BUT YOU KNOW, THE, THE, THE

01:23:26.601 --> 01:23:29.070
GENERAL STATE OF THE LAW IS THAT

01:23:29.137 --> 01:23:31.539
LAWS THAT WE PASS HERE ARE

01:23:31.606 --> 01:23:33.408
PROSPECTIVE VERSUS

01:23:33.475 --> 01:23:35.276
RETROSPECTIVE. SO IF IT'S A

01:23:35.343 --> 01:23:36.611
CLARIFICATION, I DON'T THINK WE

01:23:36.678 --> 01:23:37.712
SPECIFIED THIS IS A

01:23:37.779 --> 01:23:39.114
CLARIFICATION OF LAW VERSUS

01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:40.915
ENACTMENT OF A NEW LAW. SO I

01:23:40.982 --> 01:23:44.185
ASSUME SOMEONE WOULD WOULD SUE

01:23:44.252 --> 01:23:45.920
IF THERE'S A IF ONE OF THESE IS

01:23:45.987 --> 01:23:48.556
EMBEDDED IN OUR IN ONE OF THESE

01:23:48.623 --> 01:23:49.190
ARBITRATION CLAUSES EMBEDDED IN

01:23:49.257 --> 01:23:50.759
AN AGREEMENT THAT THEY'VE

01:23:50.825 --> 01:23:54.929
SIGNED, THEN OF COURSE, THE

01:23:54.996 --> 01:23:56.231
DEFENDANT WOULD SAY THAT THERE'S

01:23:56.297 --> 01:23:58.600
AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN

01:23:58.666 --> 01:24:00.769
EFFECT AND WOULD RAISE THAT. AND

01:24:00.835 --> 01:24:06.174
THEN THE, THE, THE PLAINTIFF

01:24:06.241 --> 01:24:07.742
WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO SORT

01:24:07.809 --> 01:24:09.978
OF POINT TO THE LAW AND SAY THAT

01:24:10.044 --> 01:24:10.812
IT'S IN EFFECT, IT'S NOT IN

01:24:10.879 --> 01:24:12.881
EFFECT, I ASSUME. RIGHT? THAT'S

01:24:12.947 --> 01:24:13.815
CORRECT. I ASSUME THE PLAINTIFF

01:24:13.882 --> 01:24:15.517
WOULD SAY THIS IS NOT

01:24:15.583 --> 01:24:16.751
RETROACTIVE NECESSARILY. IT'S A

01:24:16.818 --> 01:24:19.220
CLARIFICATION OF THE LAW. SO

01:24:19.287 --> 01:24:19.888
OKAY. WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:24:19.954 --> 01:24:21.990
I'M PROFESSOR, YOU HAVE ANY

01:24:22.056 --> 01:24:23.224
FURTHER COMMENT? OKAY. NO, THAT

01:24:23.291 --> 01:24:25.126
SOUNDS EXACTLY RIGHT. YEAH.

01:24:25.193 --> 01:24:26.694
OKAY. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR

01:24:26.761 --> 01:24:28.897
QUESTIONS? ALL RIGHT. WELL,

01:24:28.963 --> 01:24:29.964
THANK YOU, SENATOR, FOR BRINGING

01:24:30.031 --> 01:24:31.099
THIS FORWARD. I THINK THERE'S

01:24:31.166 --> 01:24:33.902
BEEN A FEW FAMOUS CASES IN THIS

01:24:33.968 --> 01:24:36.337
SPACE WHERE I THINK THIS WILL

01:24:36.404 --> 01:24:37.272
HELP TO CLARIFY AND ENSURE THAT

01:24:37.338 --> 01:24:39.574
THE GENERAL PUBLIC HAS THE

01:24:39.641 --> 01:24:41.876
OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY NOT BE

01:24:41.943 --> 01:24:43.244
FORCED INTO ARBITRATION IN

01:24:43.311 --> 01:24:45.313
SITUATIONS WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE

01:24:45.380 --> 01:24:47.615
NO BELIEF THAT THEY SIGNED A

01:24:47.682 --> 01:24:48.783
CONTRACT THAT WOULD REQUIRE

01:24:48.850 --> 01:24:51.586
SUCH. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE? I

01:24:51.653 --> 01:24:53.721
URGE AND I VOTE THANK YOU.

AN ACCURATE WAY OF DETERMINING

01:28:57.365 --> 01:28:58.466

EVIDENCE BASED RESEARCH, BUT

01:29:13.347 --> 01:29:14.982

LASTING EFFECTS OF SLAVERY AND

01:29:20.988 --> 01:29:23.791

MORNING. ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. MY

01:33:50.124 --> 01:33:51.459
NAME IS MICHAEL WILLIS AND I'M A

01:33:51.525 --> 01:33:53.728
PROFESSIONAL GENEALOGIST WITH 24

01:33:53.794 --> 01:33:55.496
YEARS EXPERIENCE, BOARD CHAIR OF

01:33:55.563 --> 01:33:56.897
THE AFRICAN AMERICAN

01:33:56.964 --> 01:33:58.265
GENEALOGICAL SOCIETY OF NORTHERN

01:33:58.332 --> 01:34:00.101
CALIFORNIA, AND AUTHOR OF THE

01:34:00.167 --> 01:34:01.235
PUBLISHED BOOK WHEN YOUR

01:34:01.302 --> 01:34:03.304
ANCESTORS CHOOSE YOU FINDING

01:34:03.371 --> 01:34:05.706
BINKY THE SENATE. THE SENATOR

01:34:05.773 --> 01:34:07.675
HAS REPEATEDLY STATED IN

01:34:07.742 --> 01:34:09.043
NUMEROUS HEARINGS THAT HER

01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:10.611
FAMILY'S ANCESTORS STILL HAVE

01:34:10.678 --> 01:34:12.313
NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED, AND SHE

01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:14.882
USES THAT ALLEGATION TO

01:34:14.949 --> 01:34:16.350
GENERALIZE THAT THIS IS THE NORM

01:34:16.417 --> 01:34:17.785
FOR MOST AFRICAN AMERICANS IN

01:34:17.852 --> 01:34:19.620
THIS COUNTRY. WELL, NOTHING CAN

01:34:19.687 --> 01:34:21.655
BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH. WHEN

01:34:21.722 --> 01:34:23.257
SPEAKING OF AFRICAN AMERICAN

01:34:23.324 --> 01:34:24.658
GENEALOGY, SHE STATES THAT

01:34:24.725 --> 01:34:26.027
FAMILIES WERE SEPARATED, NAMES

01:34:26.093 --> 01:34:27.795
WERE CHANGED, RECORDS LOST,

01:34:27.862 --> 01:34:29.663
DESTROYED, OR NEVER CREATED.

01:34:29.730 --> 01:34:31.465
ALTHOUGH THOSE ARE TRUE

01:34:31.532 --> 01:34:33.401
OCCURRENCES, THEY ARE NOT.

01:34:33.467 --> 01:34:35.002
THEY'RE NOT AS PREVALENT AS SHE

01:34:35.069 --> 01:34:37.171
INSINUATES. LAST SPRING, I

01:34:37.238 --> 01:34:38.672
ATTENDED AN EVENT HELD AT THE

01:34:38.739 --> 01:34:39.774
CALIFORNIA STATE ARCHIVES IN

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:41.809
WHICH THE SENATOR'S OWN MOTHER,

01:34:41.876 --> 01:34:43.377
SECRETARY SHIRLEY WEBER, TALKED

01:34:43.444 --> 01:34:44.879
ABOUT HER FATHER, DAVID NASH,

01:34:44.945 --> 01:34:46.580
AND HOW HE STOOD UP TO LYNCH

01:34:46.647 --> 01:34:48.082
MOBS IN THE SOUTH, AND

01:34:48.149 --> 01:34:49.817
SUBSEQUENTLY, HER FAMILY FLED

01:34:49.884 --> 01:34:51.986
HEMPSTEAD COUNTY, ARKANSAS, THIS

01:34:52.053 --> 01:34:53.888
PAST SATURDAY MORNING. I REACHED

01:34:53.954 --> 01:34:55.589
HER, RESEARCHED HER FATHER AND

01:34:55.656 --> 01:34:57.491
FOUND HIS PARENTS, WHO WERE BORN

01:34:57.558 --> 01:35:00.594
IN THE 1880S, IN 20 MINUTES. IN

01:35:00.661 --> 01:35:01.996
THE NEXT 20 MINUTES, I FOUND

01:35:02.063 --> 01:35:03.864
FOUR OF HIS GRANDPARENTS, AND

01:35:03.931 --> 01:35:05.733
WITHIN THE NEXT HOUR AND A HALF,

01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:07.068
I FOUND HIS GREAT GRANDFATHER,

01:35:07.134 --> 01:35:08.836
ANTHONY STEWART, IN THE

01:35:08.903 --> 01:35:10.237
FREEDMEN'S BUREAU RECORDS AND

01:35:10.304 --> 01:35:12.506
LABOR CONTRACTS JUST AFTER THE

01:35:12.573 --> 01:35:14.308
CIVIL WAR. I ALSO FOUND THE

01:35:14.375 --> 01:35:15.276
SENATOR'S FOUR TIMES GREAT

01:35:15.342 --> 01:35:16.444
GRANDFATHER, WARREN HOOD, A

01:35:16.510 --> 01:35:18.913
NATIVE OF VIRGINIA. ON THE 1870

01:35:18.979 --> 01:35:21.148
U.S. FEDERAL CENSUS, FIVE YEARS

01:35:21.215 --> 01:35:23.250
AFTER THE CIVIL WAR ENDED. HE

01:35:23.317 --> 01:35:27.621
WAS BORN IN 1790. HERE'S THE

01:35:27.688 --> 01:35:31.725
FULL REPORT. AND AGAIN, ALTHOUGH

01:35:31.792 --> 01:35:33.794
THE RESEARCH BEYOND DAVID'S

01:35:33.861 --> 01:35:35.463
PARENTS IS MORE THAN THE TASK

01:35:35.529 --> 01:35:38.466
FORCE REQUIRES, I SHARE THIS TO

01:35:38.532 --> 01:35:39.500
EMPHASIZE THE PROVEN,

01:35:39.567 --> 01:35:41.302
ESTABLISHED METHODOLOGIES AND

01:35:41.368 --> 01:35:43.437
GENEALOGY THAT GENEALOGISTS LIKE

01:35:43.504 --> 01:35:47.108
MYSELF USE THAT DON'T REQUIRE $6

01:35:47.174 --> 01:35:49.610
MILLION TO IMPLEMENT. I DID THE

01:35:49.677 --> 01:35:51.412
SAME THING FOR FORMER ASSEMBLY

01:35:51.479 --> 01:35:53.280
MEMBER JIM COOPER AND HIS FOUR

01:35:53.347 --> 01:35:54.915
TIME GREAT GRANDPARENTS IN THE

01:35:54.982 --> 01:35:56.517
FREEDMEN'S BUREAU RECORDS, AND

01:35:56.584 --> 01:35:58.385
WE APPEARED ON GOOD DAY

01:35:58.452 --> 01:35:59.086
SACRAMENTO TO SHARE THE

01:35:59.153 --> 01:36:00.788
DISCOVERIES. JUST THIS WEEKEND,

01:36:00.855 --> 01:36:02.523
THE SACRAMENTO PUBLIC LIBRARY

01:36:02.590 --> 01:36:03.824
HOSTED MY VIRTUAL PRESENTATION

01:36:03.891 --> 01:36:05.493

AFRICAN-AMERICAN GENEALOGY, IN

01:36:06.627 --> 01:36:08.229
WHICH I SHOW THE AUDIENCE HOW

01:36:08.295 --> 01:36:10.131
THEY CAN APPLY THESE METHODS FOR

01:36:10.197 --> 01:36:11.632
SUCCESSFUL RESULTS. IF THE

01:36:11.699 --> 01:36:13.267
SENATOR STILL INTENDS ON GIVING

01:36:13.334 --> 01:36:16.036
$6 MILLION TO THE CSU, I CAN

01:36:16.103 --> 01:36:18.372
SEND HER MY BILL AS WELL. THANK

01:36:18.439 --> 01:36:23.310
YOU, THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING,

01:36:23.377 --> 01:36:24.545
CHAIR MEMBERS. MY NAME IS CHRIS

01:36:24.612 --> 01:36:27.114
LAWSON. I'M THE LEAD VOLUNTEER,

01:36:27.181 --> 01:36:28.415
ORGANIZER AND ADVOCATE WITH THE

01:36:28.482 --> 01:36:29.917
COALITION FOR JUST AND EQUITABLE

01:36:29.984 --> 01:36:30.818
CALIFORNIA. WE ARE THE STATE'S

01:36:30.885 --> 01:36:33.454
FIRST ONLY LEADING GRASSROOTS

01:36:33.521 --> 01:36:35.322
ORGANIZATION, BORN AND BRED FOR

01:36:35.389 --> 01:36:35.890

01:36:37.658 --> 01:36:39.593
OPPOSE SB 437 AND URGE YOUR NO

VOTE OR DON'T VOTE ON THIS

01:36:41.862 --> 01:36:44.331
FLAWED AND MISGUIDED PROPOSAL.

01:36:44.398 --> 01:36:46.200
SB 437 IS NOT A STEP FORWARD.

01:36:46.267 --> 01:36:47.434
IT'S A STEP BACKWARD. RATHER

01:36:47.501 --> 01:36:48.536
THAN IMPLEMENTING WHAT

01:36:48.602 --> 01:36:50.104
CALIFORNIA'S OAN REPARATIONS

01:36:50.171 --> 01:36:51.739
TASK FORCE ALREADY RECOMMENDED,

01:36:51.805 --> 01:36:53.307
THE DELIVERY OF GENEALOGY

01:36:53.374 --> 01:36:55.809
SERVICES DIRECTLY TO RESIDENTS

01:36:55.876 --> 01:36:57.111
IMMEDIATELY. THIS BILL PROPOSES

01:36:57.178 --> 01:36:59.446
AN ACADEMIC STUDY OF GENEALOGY,

01:36:59.513 --> 01:37:00.881
WITH NO REQUIREMENT THAT ANY OF

01:37:00.948 --> 01:37:03.417
ITS FINDINGS BE ACTED UPON. A

01:37:03.484 --> 01:37:05.186
STUDY OF GENEALOGY, WHICH EVEN

01:37:05.252 --> 01:37:06.720
TOPPED GENEALOGISTS IN THE STATE

01:37:06.787 --> 01:37:08.656
TELL US, IS UNNECESSARY. I

01:37:08.722 --> 01:37:10.257
CANNOT UNDERSCORE THIS POINT

01:37:10.324 --> 01:37:12.326
ENOUGH. MEMBERS. GENEALOGISTS

01:37:12.393 --> 01:37:14.562
ARE OPPOSING THIS GENEALOGY

01:37:14.628 --> 01:37:17.097
STUDY. THIS BILL ALSO PRESENTS A

01:37:17.164 --> 01:37:18.832
LEGAL AND PRACTICAL

01:37:18.899 --> 01:37:20.334
CONTRADICTION. IT PROPOSES TO

01:37:20.401 --> 01:37:21.835
STUDY GENEALOGY WHEN THE TASK

01:37:21.902 --> 01:37:23.571
FORCE ALREADY CONCLUDED THAT THE

01:37:23.637 --> 01:37:25.639
STATE MUST DO GENEALOGY, THAT

01:37:25.706 --> 01:37:27.541
IS, PROVIDE ACTUAL SERVICES TO

01:37:27.608 --> 01:37:28.909
HELP BLACK CALIFORNIANS TRACE

01:37:28.976 --> 01:37:30.711
THEIR LINEAGE BACK TO US CHATTEL

01:37:30.778 --> 01:37:32.913
SLAVERY. SB 437 DELAYS THAT

01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:35.416
WORK, AND IN SO DOING, IT SLOWS

01:37:35.482 --> 01:37:37.251
TO A HALT. FUTURE REPARATIONS

01:37:37.318 --> 01:37:38.652
POLICIES, BENEFITS AND RIGHTS

01:37:38.719 --> 01:37:40.487
OWED AND BESTOWED UPON

01:37:40.554 --> 01:37:41.855
DESCENDANTS, MANY OF WHICH WILL

01:37:41.922 --> 01:37:43.290
PASS THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE'S

01:37:43.357 --> 01:37:44.825
JURISDICTION. AND IF THAT WASN'T

01:37:44.892 --> 01:37:46.927
ENOUGH, THE PROPOSAL SB 437

01:37:46.994 --> 01:37:48.996
CONFLICTS WITH ANOTHER BILL, SB

01:37:49.063 --> 01:37:52.333
518, WHICH AUTHORIZES A SEPARATE

01:37:52.399 --> 01:37:54.902
GENEALOGY PROCESS. THE RESULT,

01:37:54.969 --> 01:37:57.037
BUREAUCRATIC RED TAPE,

01:37:57.104 --> 01:37:59.106
CONFUSION, OVERLAPPING MANDATES,

01:37:59.173 --> 01:38:01.642

TAXPAYER EXPENSE. THIS ISN'T

01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:05.246
JUSTICE, IT'S OBSTRUCTION.

01:38:05.312 --> 01:38:06.313
CALIFORNIA DOESN'T NEED MORE

01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:08.182
RESEARCH INTO WHETHER IT SHOULD

01:38:08.249 --> 01:38:10.684
ACT. IT NEEDS TO ACT. WE URGE

01:38:10.751 --> 01:38:12.820

01:40:46.306 --> 01:40:47.674
RIGHT. BRING IT BACK TO

01:40:47.741 --> 01:40:48.942
COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS

01:40:49.009 --> 01:40:53.814
COMMENTS, MOTIONS. DO WE HAVE A

01:40:53.881 --> 01:40:57.751
MOTION? SECOND MOTION AND A

01:40:57.818 --> 01:40:59.052
SECOND. AND I KNOW SENATOR YOU

01:40:59.119 --> 01:41:00.554
HAVE ANOTHER BILL AFTER THIS.

01:41:00.621 --> 01:41:03.023
AND I'LL JUST POSE THE QUESTION

01:41:03.090 --> 01:41:05.159
BECAUSE I THINK IT WILL BE

01:41:05.225 --> 01:41:07.428
RELATED TO BOTH WITH THIS BILL.

01:41:07.494 --> 01:41:11.832
DOES THIS. STILL ALLOW IF THIS

01:41:11.899 --> 01:41:14.368
BILL WERE TO PASS AND IF THE

01:41:14.435 --> 01:41:14.968
NEXT BILL WERE TO PASS, WOULD

01:41:15.035 --> 01:41:16.770
ALLOW THE ACTIONS OF THE

01:41:16.837 --> 01:41:17.538
SUBSEQUENT BILL TO CONTINUE TO

01:41:17.604 --> 01:41:19.273
MOVE FORWARD, OR WOULD THIS

01:41:19.339 --> 01:41:22.242
DELAY ACTIONS ON ON THE

01:41:22.309 --> 01:41:24.344
SUBSEQUENT BILL? YEAH. THANK YOU

01:41:24.411 --> 01:41:25.446
SO MUCH, CHAIR, FOR THAT

01:41:25.512 --> 01:41:27.548
QUESTION. THIS BILL DOES NOT

01:41:27.614 --> 01:41:29.049
DELAY THE SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS OF

01:41:29.116 --> 01:41:30.584
THE NEXT BILL. THE NEXT BILL,

01:41:30.651 --> 01:41:32.286
WHICH WE'LL DISCUSS LATER, IS

01:41:32.352 --> 01:41:36.223
ACTUALLY ESTABLISHING THE AGENCY

01:41:36.290 --> 01:41:39.159
FOR, FOR DESCENDANTS OF AMERICAN

01:41:39.226 --> 01:41:40.861
CHATTEL SLAVERY. THAT IS GOING

01:41:40.928 --> 01:41:42.663
TO TAKE SOME TIME. RIGHT. ALL

01:41:42.729 --> 01:41:46.300
THIS BILL DOES IS GIVE A

01:41:46.366 --> 01:41:49.269
FRAMEWORK FOR THE MONEY THAT WE

01:41:49.336 --> 01:41:51.472
ALREADY ALLOCATED AND VOTED AND

01:41:51.538 --> 01:41:55.142
SIGNED INTO LAW ON FRIDAY, SO I

01:41:55.209 --> 01:41:57.110
DIDN'T I DON'T HAVE $6 MILLION

01:41:57.177 --> 01:41:59.713
TO GIVE. WE, AS THE LEGISLATURE

01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:02.249
PASSED THE BUDGET BILL LAST

01:42:02.316 --> 01:42:03.350
FRIDAY, AND THE GOVERNOR ALREADY

01:42:03.417 --> 01:42:05.853
SIGNED IT, ALLOCATING $6 MILLION

01:42:05.919 --> 01:42:08.388
TO CSU FOR THIS PURPOSE. THIS

01:42:08.455 --> 01:42:09.490
PROVIDES THE STRUCTURE, IT

01:42:09.556 --> 01:42:11.625
PROVIDES OVERSIGHT. IT PROVIDES

01:42:11.692 --> 01:42:12.793
ACCOUNTABILITY SO THAT THEY HAVE

01:42:12.860 --> 01:42:14.695
A START DATE. THEY HAVE AN END

01:42:14.761 --> 01:42:15.796
DATE. THEY HAVE TO REPORT BACK

01:42:15.863 --> 01:42:17.798
TO THE LEGISLATURE. WITHOUT THIS

01:42:17.865 --> 01:42:19.967
BILL, THEY JUST HAVE THE $6

01:42:20.033 --> 01:42:21.835
MILLION. AND IS ANYTHING PREVENT

01:42:21.902 --> 01:42:24.137
THE CSU FROM EITHER USING THEIR

01:42:24.204 --> 01:42:26.707
OWN ACADEMIC GENEALOGISTS OR

01:42:26.773 --> 01:42:28.141
CONSULTING WITH OUTSIDE

01:42:28.208 --> 01:42:29.209
GENEALOGISTS IN THEIR

01:42:29.276 --> 01:42:30.444
CONSTRUCTION OF THEIR FRAMEWORK.

01:42:30.511 --> 01:42:32.946
SO THIS BILL ALLOWS FOR THEM TO

01:42:33.013 --> 01:42:34.214
UTILIZE OTHER UNIVERSITIES,

01:42:34.281 --> 01:42:36.416
OTHER GENEALOGISTS, OTHER

01:42:36.483 --> 01:42:37.885
ENTITIES. THEY ARE JUST THE

01:42:37.951 --> 01:42:39.353
HOST, BUT WITHOUT THIS BILL,

01:42:39.419 --> 01:42:42.289
THEY CAN TAKE THE $6 MILLION AND

01:42:42.356 --> 01:42:43.357
CREATE WHATEVER FRAMEWORK THEY

01:42:43.423 --> 01:42:45.559
WANT TO DO AND NOT HAVE TO COME

01:42:45.626 --> 01:42:46.927
BACK AND TALK WITH US. THANK

01:42:46.994 --> 01:42:48.228
YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR

01:42:48.295 --> 01:42:53.700
COMMENTS? ASSEMBLY MEMBER BRIAN,

01:42:53.767 --> 01:42:56.036
MADAM CHAIR, DID YOU SAY, MR.

01:42:56.103 --> 01:42:57.304
CHAIR, MADAM CHAIR OF THE

01:42:57.371 --> 01:42:58.906
CAUCUS, DID YOU SAY THE BILL NOW

01:42:58.972 --> 01:43:00.908
HAS AN END DATE ON IT? IT HAS A

01:43:00.974 --> 01:43:02.776
START DATE AND AN END DATE,

01:43:02.843 --> 01:43:04.244
WHICH REALLY ONLY GOES INTO

01:43:04.311 --> 01:43:05.646
EFFECT IF THIS BILL IS PASSED.

01:43:05.712 --> 01:43:06.713
OTHERWISE, LIKE I SAID, SINCE

01:43:06.780 --> 01:43:08.215
WE'VE ALREADY GIVEN THE CSU THE

01:43:08.282 --> 01:43:10.651
6 MILLION THEY CAN TAKE AS LONG

01:43:10.717 --> 01:43:12.753
AS THEY WANT. I READ EVERY PAGE

01:43:12.819 --> 01:43:13.887
OF THE REPARATIONS REPORT CITED

01:43:13.954 --> 01:43:15.822
IN THE FOOTNOTES A HALF DOZEN

01:43:15.889 --> 01:43:17.791
TIMES IN SEVERAL SECTIONS FOR

01:43:17.858 --> 01:43:19.593
SCHOLARSHIP. BACK AT UCLA, I

01:43:19.660 --> 01:43:23.330
DIDN'T SEE A METHODOLOGY FOR

01:43:23.397 --> 01:43:25.732
DETERMINING SOMEONE'S LINEAGE

01:43:25.799 --> 01:43:27.701
ARTICULATED IN THE REPORT. ONLY

01:43:27.768 --> 01:43:29.670
THE QUESTION ABOUT WHO SHOULD BE

01:43:29.736 --> 01:43:30.771
ELIGIBLE IS THAT YOUR

01:43:30.837 --> 01:43:32.205
UNDERSTANDING AS WELL? THERE WAS

01:43:32.272 --> 01:43:34.308
NO METHODOLOGY, WHICH IS WHY WE

01:43:34.374 --> 01:43:36.543
AS A STATE HAVE GIVEN $6 MILLION

01:43:36.610 --> 01:43:37.978
TO THE CSU TO HELP DETERMINE

01:43:38.045 --> 01:43:39.813
THAT METHODOLOGY. AND THIS BILL

01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:41.515
RIGHT HERE WILL GIVE THEM

01:43:41.582 --> 01:43:43.016
OVERSIGHT AND A FRAMEWORK TO

01:43:43.083 --> 01:43:44.785
ACCOMPLISH THAT IN A SPECIFIC

01:43:44.851 --> 01:43:46.653
TIME FRAME. THERE ARE

01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:47.721
DISAGREEMENTS FROM SOME FOLKS

01:43:47.788 --> 01:43:49.122
ABOUT THE BEST WAY TO GO ABOUT

01:43:49.189 --> 01:43:52.826
DOING THIS. YOU BELIEVE THIS IS

01:43:52.893 --> 01:43:56.663
THE BEST WAY TO DO IT. CORRECT?

01:43:56.730 --> 01:43:58.498
I BELIEVE THIS IS THE BEST WAY

01:43:58.565 --> 01:43:59.700
TO DO IT. THE CALIFORNIA

01:43:59.766 --> 01:44:00.601
LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS

01:44:00.667 --> 01:44:01.902
BELIEVES THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO

01:44:01.969 --> 01:44:03.904
DO IT. AND I BELIEVE THAT WHEN

01:44:03.971 --> 01:44:05.639
YOU GIVE MONEY TO AN INSTITUTION

01:44:05.706 --> 01:44:08.075
TO DO THIS, YOU SHOULD HAVE A

01:44:08.141 --> 01:44:08.909
FRAMEWORK AND OVERSIGHT AND THE

01:44:08.976 --> 01:44:10.744
ABILITY TO HOLD THEM

01:44:10.811 --> 01:44:11.845
ACCOUNTABLE. AND THAT'S WHAT

01:44:11.912 --> 01:44:14.481
THIS BILL DOES. THANK YOU, MADAM

01:44:14.548 --> 01:44:16.483
CHAIR. MADAM VICE CHAIR. THANK

01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:18.785
YOU CHAIR. SO I JUST WANT TO

01:44:18.852 --> 01:44:21.254
KIND OF RECONCILE THE TWO SIDES

01:44:21.321 --> 01:44:23.290
HERE. SO THE PROFESSIONAL

01:44:23.357 --> 01:44:25.859
GENEALOGISTS BELIEVE THIS BILL

01:44:25.926 --> 01:44:27.628
IS NOT NECESSARY BECAUSE THE

01:44:27.694 --> 01:44:30.697
INFORMATION IS READILY AVAILABLE

01:44:30.764 --> 01:44:33.266
WITHIN MINUTES, ESSENTIALLY TO

01:44:33.333 --> 01:44:36.603
DO A SEARCH PROCESS. AM I

01:44:36.670 --> 01:44:39.873
STATING THAT CORRECTLY? IT'S NOT

01:44:39.940 --> 01:44:41.375
JUST THAT THE INFORMATION IS

01:44:41.441 --> 01:44:43.243
READILY, READILY AVAILABLE, IT'S

01:44:43.310 --> 01:44:45.345
THAT WE HAVE A PROVEN

01:44:45.412 --> 01:44:46.546
METHODOLOGY. THIS IS A BOOK THAT

01:44:46.613 --> 01:44:48.415
I PURCHASED 20 YEARS AGO.

01:44:48.482 --> 01:44:49.983
PROFESSIONAL GENEALOGY

01:44:50.050 --> 01:44:51.151
GENEALOGISTS HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN

01:44:51.218 --> 01:44:52.853
DOING THIS FOR DECADES. SO WE

01:44:52.919 --> 01:44:54.755
HAVE AN ESTABLISHED, PROVEN

01:44:54.821 --> 01:44:56.456
METHODOLOGY. WE HAVE A FRAMEWORK

01:44:56.523 --> 01:44:58.625
FOR HOW TO RESEARCH. SO THERE'S

01:44:58.692 --> 01:45:00.494
NO NEED FOR THE CSU TO BE

01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:01.695
INVOLVED. THEY DON'T HAVE I

01:45:01.762 --> 01:45:02.863
THINK YOU MENTIONED THAT THEY'RE

01:45:02.929 --> 01:45:04.398
THEIR OWN GENEALOGISTS. THEY

01:45:04.464 --> 01:45:05.265
DON'T HAVE THEIR OWN

01:45:05.332 --> 01:45:06.833
GENEALOGISTS. I'M I'M BOARD

01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:09.236
CHAIR OF THE AFRICAN AMERICAN

01:45:09.302 --> 01:45:10.771
GENEALOGY SOCIETY OF NORTHERN

01:45:10.837 --> 01:45:11.738
CALIFORNIA. WE'VE BEEN AROUND

01:45:11.805 --> 01:45:15.108
SINCE 1996, AND WE TEACH THESE

01:45:15.175 --> 01:45:18.045
METHODOLOGIES. SO IT'S NOT THAT

01:45:18.111 --> 01:45:20.414
I DISAGREE THAT THE THAT THE

01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:24.117
CSU'S NEED TO CREATE A FRAMEWORK

01:45:24.184 --> 01:45:25.852
OR STUDY HOW TO CREATE A

01:45:25.919 --> 01:45:27.120
FRAMEWORK FOR SOMETHING THAT WE

01:45:27.187 --> 01:45:29.156
ALREADY KNOW HOW TO DO. IN MY

01:45:29.222 --> 01:45:29.923
PERSONAL OPINION, I WOULD THINK

01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:32.859
IT WOULD BE BETTER IF THE CSU

01:45:32.926 --> 01:45:34.227
NEEDED TO GET INVOLVED, WORK

01:45:34.294 --> 01:45:35.729
WITH THE GENEALOGISTS TO CREATE

01:45:35.796 --> 01:45:37.798
A SORT OF BECAUSE IT KEEPS

01:45:37.864 --> 01:45:41.268
COMING UP IN THESE HEARINGS THAT

01:45:41.334 --> 01:45:43.170
THE WORDS KEEP COMING UP. AS FAR

01:45:43.236 --> 01:45:47.140
AS OF THE MAKING IT VALID AND

01:45:47.207 --> 01:45:48.842
MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S

01:45:48.909 --> 01:45:50.010
CREDIBILITY AND OVERSIGHT AND

01:45:50.077 --> 01:45:51.778
ALL OF THIS STUFF. IF YOU'RE

01:45:51.845 --> 01:45:53.246
CONCERNED ABOUT CREDIBILITY,

01:45:53.313 --> 01:45:55.415
WORK WITH THE GENEALOGY

01:45:55.482 --> 01:45:57.517
SOCIETIES, DEVELOP A

01:45:57.584 --> 01:45:59.653
CERTIFICATION PROGRAM THAT WOULD

01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:01.521
PROBABLY BE BETTER IF THERE'S

01:46:01.588 --> 01:46:03.023
SUCH A CONCERN OVER CHEN,

01:46:03.090 --> 01:46:04.124
BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE

01:46:04.191 --> 01:46:06.193
THERE'S A CONCERN THAT US AS

01:46:06.259 --> 01:46:07.627
GENEALOGISTS, THERE'S AN ISSUE

01:46:07.694 --> 01:46:09.763
WITH US DOING THE RESEARCH

01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:13.066
VERSUS THE CSU. IF THAT'S YOUR

01:46:13.133 --> 01:46:14.301
CONCERN, THEN HAVE THE CSU WORK

01:46:14.367 --> 01:46:15.635
WITH US TO CREATE A

01:46:15.702 --> 01:46:18.105
CERTIFICATION PROGRAM ACCORDING

01:46:18.171 --> 01:46:19.539
TO HOW THE STATE WANTS TO FRAME

01:46:19.606 --> 01:46:21.341
IT. SO THAT WAY THERE IS NO

01:46:21.408 --> 01:46:22.909
ISSUE. THERE IS NO CONCERN WITH

01:46:22.976 --> 01:46:24.010
US DOING THE WORK BECAUSE

01:46:24.077 --> 01:46:25.979
CLEARLY I CAN DO THE WORK. THERE

01:46:26.046 --> 01:46:27.848
ARE MANY AND I'M JUST ONE OF

01:46:27.914 --> 01:46:29.916
MANY, AND I DO MEAN MANY. THANK

01:46:29.983 --> 01:46:31.384
YOU. OKAY, FOLLOW UP QUESTION.

01:46:31.451 --> 01:46:32.919
I'M SORRY. I JUST WANT TO I

01:46:32.986 --> 01:46:34.921
DON'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT, BUT I

01:46:34.988 --> 01:46:36.523
JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT IN

01:46:36.590 --> 01:46:38.992
THIS BILL, IT WOULD ALLOW THE

01:46:39.059 --> 01:46:41.528
CSU TO WORK WITH OUTSIDE

01:46:41.595 --> 01:46:45.031
GENEALOGISTS. OKAY. LIKE THE

01:46:45.098 --> 01:46:46.533
INDIVIDUAL WHO'S TESTING IN

01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:48.535
OPPOSITION. OKAY. THANK YOU VERY

01:46:48.602 --> 01:46:51.872
MUCH, SENATOR. IN YOUR BINDER

01:46:51.938 --> 01:46:53.073
THERE, THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE

01:46:53.140 --> 01:46:56.143
SINCE 1996, HAVE YOU BEEN

01:46:56.209 --> 01:46:58.011
SPECIFICALLY RESEARCHING THE

01:46:58.078 --> 01:46:59.079
GENEALOGY OF DESCENDANTS OF

01:46:59.146 --> 01:47:01.248
SLAVES IN CALIFORNIA? THE

01:47:01.314 --> 01:47:03.483
ORGANIZATION'S BEEN AROUND SINCE

01:47:03.550 --> 01:47:04.885
1996. I HAVE BEEN A GENEALOGIST

01:47:04.951 --> 01:47:06.820
FOR THE LAST 24 YEARS. AND YES,

01:47:06.887 --> 01:47:08.488
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE SO IS

01:47:08.555 --> 01:47:10.991
THAT REPOSITORY OF INFORMATION.

01:47:11.057 --> 01:47:13.794
IS THAT AVAILABLE TODAY? YES,

01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:15.662
YES. AND I YOU KNOW, WHEN WE

01:47:15.729 --> 01:47:17.731
TALK ABOUT METHODOLOGIES, THE

01:47:17.798 --> 01:47:19.099
METHODOLOGY, THE METHODOLOGIES

01:47:19.166 --> 01:47:21.101
THAT WE TEACH PEOPLE, START WITH

01:47:21.168 --> 01:47:22.502
YOURSELF. WORK YOUR WAY

01:47:22.569 --> 01:47:23.737
BACKWARDS, TALK TO YOUR OLDEST

01:47:23.804 --> 01:47:26.439
LIVING RELATIVES IF POSSIBLE.

01:47:26.506 --> 01:47:29.476
GATHER RESOURCES, BIBLES,

01:47:29.543 --> 01:47:30.544
OBITUARIES, FUNERAL PROGRAMS,

01:47:30.610 --> 01:47:32.212
THINGS OF THAT NATURE, AND THEN

01:47:32.279 --> 01:47:33.413
DEVELOP RESEARCH QUESTIONS. WE

01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:35.148
GO OVER THESE THINGS ALL THE

01:47:35.215 --> 01:47:36.550
TIME, DEVELOP THE RESEARCH

01:47:36.616 --> 01:47:39.452
QUESTIONS, THEN IDENTIFY, THEN

01:47:39.519 --> 01:47:41.588
LEARN AND IDENTIFY THE AVAILABLE

01:47:41.655 --> 01:47:42.789
RESOURCES THAT ARE OUT THERE.

01:47:42.856 --> 01:47:44.057
THERE'S A LOT OF PUBLIC

01:47:44.124 --> 01:47:44.791
INFORMATION THAT'S ALREADY OUT

01:47:44.858 --> 01:47:46.660
THERE. WE TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO GO

01:47:46.726 --> 01:47:47.961
TO COURTHOUSES. WE TEACH PEOPLE

01:47:48.028 --> 01:47:49.896
HOW TO GO TO STATE ARCHIVES

01:47:49.963 --> 01:47:50.630
WHERE ALL THIS INFORMATION IS.

01:47:50.697 --> 01:47:52.332
AND THEN ONCE YOU'VE GATHERED

01:47:52.399 --> 01:47:53.466
CERTAIN FACTS, WASH, RINSE AND

01:47:53.533 --> 01:47:55.268
REPEAT. GO RIGHT BACK TO THE

01:47:55.335 --> 01:47:57.037
INFORMATION. YOU, YOU YOU

01:47:57.103 --> 01:47:58.238
DEVELOP MORE RESEARCH QUESTIONS

01:47:58.305 --> 01:47:59.673
WHICH WILL THEN LEAD TO MORE

01:47:59.739 --> 01:48:01.474
RESEARCH. SO YOU HAVE DOCUMENTED

01:48:01.541 --> 01:48:02.843
INFORMATION ON THE DESCENDENTS

01:48:02.909 --> 01:48:06.012
ALL AS I MEAN THOROUGHLY

01:48:06.079 --> 01:48:07.113
INVESTIGATED, RESEARCHED THROUGH

01:48:07.180 --> 01:48:08.548
THAT METHODOLOGY YOU JUST

01:48:08.615 --> 01:48:10.016
DESCRIBED. ABSOLUTELY. I WROTE

01:48:10.083 --> 01:48:11.518
AN ENTIRE BOOK ON IT AND

01:48:11.585 --> 01:48:13.620
PUBLISHED IT. SO I GUESS THAT

01:48:13.687 --> 01:48:14.988
BEGS THE QUESTION, SENATOR, WHY

01:48:15.055 --> 01:48:17.190
DO WE NEED IF WE'VE ALREADY

01:48:17.257 --> 01:48:19.359
HAVE, WE ALREADY HAVE RESOURCE

01:48:19.426 --> 01:48:21.828
DATA THAT IDENTIFIES AND THAT IS

01:48:21.895 --> 01:48:23.330
THE FOUNDATIONAL ELEMENT TO

01:48:23.396 --> 01:48:25.065
DETERMINE REPARATIONS. IF THAT

01:48:25.131 --> 01:48:28.101
WERE TO GO FORWARD, WHY MORE

01:48:28.168 --> 01:48:29.836
WOULD THIS BILL AND YOUR OTHER

01:48:29.903 --> 01:48:31.805
BILL DO TO CREATE THAT DATABASE

01:48:31.872 --> 01:48:33.874
OF INFORMATION? WELL, THE OTHER

01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:35.575
BILL IS DIFFERENT. SO WE'LL GET

01:48:35.642 --> 01:48:37.110
TO THAT BILL WHEN I PRESENT

01:48:37.177 --> 01:48:40.614
THAT. HOWEVER, THIS IS BASED ON

01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:42.515
THE RECOMMENDATION FROM THE TASK

01:48:42.582 --> 01:48:43.917
FORCE AND IN THE TASK FORCE, AS

01:48:43.984 --> 01:48:46.386
WAS STATED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:48:46.453 --> 01:48:49.589
BRYANT, THERE WAS NO CLEAR.

01:48:49.656 --> 01:48:51.191
THERE WAS NOTHING IN THERE TO

01:48:51.258 --> 01:48:52.792
SAY. THIS IS HOW YOU SHOULD

01:48:52.859 --> 01:48:54.527
DETERMINE SOMEONE'S LINEAGE,

01:48:54.594 --> 01:48:59.432
THEREFORE. THE STATE WE HAVE

01:48:59.499 --> 01:49:04.004
GIVEN THE CSU $6 MILLION ALREADY

01:49:04.070 --> 01:49:06.172
TO DEVELOP A METHODOLOGY FOR

01:49:06.239 --> 01:49:07.941
THIS AND WORK WITH OTHER

01:49:08.008 --> 01:49:10.176
UNIVERSITIES, WORK WITH OTHER

01:49:10.243 --> 01:49:11.645
GENEALOGISTS SO THAT IT IS CLEAR

01:49:11.711 --> 01:49:13.647
IT IS EVIDENCE BASED. IT IS

01:49:13.713 --> 01:49:15.582
REPRODUCIBLE AS A STATE BECAUSE

01:49:15.649 --> 01:49:17.384
WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT OVERSIGHT

01:49:17.450 --> 01:49:19.819
OF FUNDS. I DON'T THINK YOU OR

01:49:19.886 --> 01:49:20.987
ANYONE ELSE WOULD JUST WANT TO

01:49:21.054 --> 01:49:22.789
GIVE MONEY AWAY TO SOMETHING

01:49:22.856 --> 01:49:24.925
THAT WE HAVE NO OVERSIGHT. WE

01:49:24.991 --> 01:49:27.060
HAVE OVERSIGHT INTO THE CSU

01:49:27.127 --> 01:49:28.762
SYSTEM. AND THAT'S WHY IT'S VERY

01:49:28.828 --> 01:49:30.530
BROAD IN TERMS OF WHO THEY CAN

01:49:30.597 --> 01:49:33.166
AND SHOULD WORK WITH IN ORDER TO

01:49:33.233 --> 01:49:35.435
CREATE A METHOD THAT WORKS FOR

01:49:35.502 --> 01:49:37.170
EVERYONE, REGARDLESS OF IF YOU

01:49:37.237 --> 01:49:38.838
KNOW YOUR YOUR MOTHER, YOUR

01:49:38.905 --> 01:49:39.673
FATHER, YOUR SISTER, YOUR

01:49:39.739 --> 01:49:42.309
BROTHER OR YOU DON'T. OKAY.

01:49:42.375 --> 01:49:43.877
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. SORRY,

01:49:43.944 --> 01:49:47.247
BRIAN. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR.

01:49:47.314 --> 01:49:48.648
MADAM CHAIR, THERE'S. IS THERE

01:49:48.715 --> 01:49:49.883
ANYTHING IN YOUR BILL THAT

01:49:49.950 --> 01:49:52.319
PRECLUDES THE CSU FROM

01:49:52.385 --> 01:49:52.886
CONTRACTING AND BRINGING IN

01:49:52.953 --> 01:49:54.254
EXPERTS LIKE THIS GENTLEMAN

01:49:54.321 --> 01:49:55.855
RIGHT HERE? NO, SIR. WE'VE NEVER

01:49:55.922 --> 01:49:58.692
MET BEFORE. LOVE TO ADDRESS YOU

01:49:58.758 --> 01:50:00.126
BY YOUR NAME. MICHAEL. MICHAEL

01:50:00.193 --> 01:50:01.962
WILLIS. FOR CHILDREN IN FOSTER

01:50:02.028 --> 01:50:03.330
CARE, IN CLOSED CASES WHO DON'T

01:50:03.396 --> 01:50:05.098
KNOW THEIR BIOLOGICAL PARENTS,

01:50:05.165 --> 01:50:06.566
OR MAYBE SECOND GENERATION

01:50:06.633 --> 01:50:07.667
FOSTER CHILDREN BECAUSE THEIR

01:50:07.734 --> 01:50:09.669
PARENTS WERE ALSO IN THE SYSTEM,

01:50:09.736 --> 01:50:11.304
HOW DO YOU DETERMINE THEIR

01:50:11.371 --> 01:50:13.840
LINEAGE? THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE

01:50:13.907 --> 01:50:14.941
ABSOLUTELY NO KNOWLEDGE AND

01:50:15.008 --> 01:50:17.177
MAYBE NO EVIDENCE OF WHO THEIR

01:50:17.243 --> 01:50:19.245
THEIR PARENTS WERE, THAT'S WHERE

01:50:19.312 --> 01:50:21.381
YOU WOULD HAVE TO RELY ON

01:50:21.448 --> 01:50:23.450
GENETIC GENEALOGY. AND WITH

01:50:23.516 --> 01:50:25.719
GENETIC GENEALOGY, THEY WOULD

01:50:25.785 --> 01:50:27.754
ONCE THEY TAKE A TEST FOR, LET'S

01:50:27.821 --> 01:50:29.222
JUST SAY, FOR EXAMPLE,

01:50:29.289 --> 01:50:31.758
ANCESTRY.COM. WHEN THEY TAKE THE

01:50:31.825 --> 01:50:33.593
TEST, IT'S GOING TO SHOW THEM A

01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:34.961
LIST OF ALL OF THE RELATIVES

01:50:35.028 --> 01:50:36.696
WHO'VE ALSO TAKEN THE TEST, WHO

01:50:36.763 --> 01:50:37.831
THEY'RE RELATED TO. AND WE WOULD

01:50:37.897 --> 01:50:39.666
HAVE TO START IT WOULD BE AN

01:50:39.733 --> 01:50:40.900
INVESTIGATION OF, OF STARTING

01:50:40.967 --> 01:50:43.503
WITH THE MOST CLOSELY RELATED

01:50:43.570 --> 01:50:44.804
RELATIVES IN THE DATABASE,

01:50:44.871 --> 01:50:45.772
BECAUSE IT SORTS THEM FROM THE

01:50:45.839 --> 01:50:47.741
MOST CLOSELY RELATED TO THE MOST

01:50:47.807 --> 01:50:48.808
DISTANT. SO IF THEY HAVE SECOND

01:50:48.875 --> 01:50:50.944
OR THIRD COUSINS IN THERE, WE

01:50:51.011 --> 01:50:52.779
START WITH THAT. AND AT THAT

01:50:52.846 --> 01:50:54.414
POINT YOU'RE DOING TRADITIONAL

01:50:54.481 --> 01:50:56.216
GENEALOGY. YOU HAVE TO IDENTIFY

01:50:56.282 --> 01:50:57.550
THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND TRACE

01:50:57.617 --> 01:50:59.452
THEIR ANCESTRY BACK AND SEE

01:50:59.519 --> 01:51:01.788
WHERE THE PEDIGREES MERGE TO

01:51:01.855 --> 01:51:03.523
COMMON ANCESTORS. SO YOU'RE

01:51:03.590 --> 01:51:04.958
STILL GOING TO DO GENEALOGY, IS

01:51:05.025 --> 01:51:07.460
THERE? YOU KNOW, I I'VE GOT

01:51:07.527 --> 01:51:09.963
DIFFERENT. ONE OF MY UNCLES IS A

01:51:10.030 --> 01:51:11.097
GENEALOGIST WHO TRACED BACK

01:51:11.164 --> 01:51:12.499
FAMILY GOING WAY, WAY BACK.

01:51:12.565 --> 01:51:14.667
OKAY. FAMILIAR WITH SOME OF THE

01:51:14.734 --> 01:51:17.103
STEPS. BUT I DO THINK FOR SOME

01:51:17.170 --> 01:51:18.138
OF THOSE CASES IT'S IT IS TRICKY

01:51:18.204 --> 01:51:19.773
AND UNIQUE, AND IT DOESN'T

01:51:19.839 --> 01:51:20.640
APPEAR THAT THERE IS KIND OF A

01:51:20.707 --> 01:51:21.841
STANDARD ACCEPTED METHOD. FOR

01:51:21.908 --> 01:51:23.676
EXAMPLE, YOU JUST MENTIONED

01:51:23.743 --> 01:51:24.677
ANCESTRY.COM. IS THAT LIKE THE

01:51:24.744 --> 01:51:26.946
IS THAT THE PARTNER FOR

01:51:27.013 --> 01:51:28.348
GENEALOGISTS BECAUSE IT'S JUST A

01:51:28.415 --> 01:51:29.849
TOOL? NO, IT'S JUST A TOOL IN

01:51:29.916 --> 01:51:32.052
THE TOOLBOX. AND THAT'S PART OF

01:51:32.118 --> 01:51:34.120
MY POINT, BECAUSE 23 AND ME, FOR

01:51:34.187 --> 01:51:34.721
EXAMPLE, IS ONE OF THOSE TOOLS

01:51:34.788 --> 01:51:36.589
NOW UNDER INTENSE LITIGATION AND

01:51:36.656 --> 01:51:38.091
SELLING PEOPLE'S DATA TO PRIVATE

01:51:38.158 --> 01:51:39.492
COMPANIES. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:51:39.559 --> 01:51:40.960
JUSTICE IS ACTUALLY SUING THEM

01:51:41.027 --> 01:51:43.163
OR TRYING TO PREVENT THEM FROM

01:51:43.229 --> 01:51:44.564
BEING ACQUIRED BY THIS PRIVATE

01:51:44.631 --> 01:51:45.999
COMPANY WHO MIGHT HAVE NEFARIOUS

01:51:46.066 --> 01:51:47.033
MEANS. AND I THINK THAT'S PART

01:51:47.100 --> 01:51:49.402
OF WHAT THE CHAIR IS TRYING TO.

01:51:49.469 --> 01:51:50.804
BUT I DON'T SEE WHERE THE WHERE

01:51:50.870 --> 01:51:53.273
THE I DON'T SEE WHERE THE CSU'S

01:51:53.339 --> 01:51:54.607
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT. I

01:51:54.674 --> 01:51:56.709
THINK REGARDLESS OF THE CSU'S OR

01:51:56.776 --> 01:51:58.545
OTHERWISE, I THINK THERE'S NOT A

01:51:58.611 --> 01:52:01.081
THERE IS NOT A DETERMINED WAY

01:52:01.147 --> 01:52:02.615
FOR ALL PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO GO

01:52:02.682 --> 01:52:04.984
THROUGH NONTRADITIONAL ROUTES.

01:52:05.051 --> 01:52:06.386
THAT'S NOT TRUE. FOR EXAMPLE.

01:52:06.453 --> 01:52:07.620
THAT'S NOT TRUE. LET ME FINISH

01:52:07.687 --> 01:52:09.856
MY QUESTION, SIR. WHICH TOOL TO

01:52:09.923 --> 01:52:12.525
USE? FOR EXAMPLE, WHICH TOOL OF

01:52:12.592 --> 01:52:15.061
THE DNA TESTING IS MORE VALID?

01:52:15.128 --> 01:52:16.963
SHOULD THERE BE SOME SORT OF

01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:20.233
PUBLIC TOOL THAT IS. SO IS THE

01:52:20.300 --> 01:52:22.435
STATE GOING TO DEVELOP A DNA

01:52:22.502 --> 01:52:23.636
TESTING? I THINK ALL OF THOSE

01:52:23.703 --> 01:52:25.572
ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT I THINK

01:52:25.638 --> 01:52:26.739
YOURSELF AND SCHOLARS AND OTHERS

01:52:26.806 --> 01:52:28.775
WHO ARE EXPERTS IN THIS FIELD

01:52:28.842 --> 01:52:29.576
NEED TO CRITICALLY ASK, HOW DO

01:52:29.642 --> 01:52:30.844
WE PROTECT PEOPLE'S INFORMATION

01:52:30.910 --> 01:52:32.412
GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND

01:52:32.479 --> 01:52:33.913
VERIFY IT AND VALIDATE IT AND

01:52:33.980 --> 01:52:35.181
USE THE TRADITIONAL METHODS THAT

01:52:35.248 --> 01:52:37.050
EXIST? ONCE YOU ONCE YOU START

01:52:37.117 --> 01:52:38.918
GOING DOWN THAT PATHWAY. AND I

01:52:38.985 --> 01:52:40.053
THINK, YOU KNOW, I THINK THOSE

01:52:40.120 --> 01:52:41.988
ARE THE THINGS THAT AND I DON'T

01:52:42.055 --> 01:52:43.623
WANT TO SPEAK FOR THE AUTHOR

01:52:43.690 --> 01:52:44.724
TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH WHAT'S

01:52:44.791 --> 01:52:46.860
THE BEST WAY TO KEEP PEOPLE AS

01:52:46.926 --> 01:52:48.294
SAFE AS POSSIBLE, AS VALID AS

01:52:48.361 --> 01:52:50.096
POSSIBLE, AND RESPECT

01:52:50.163 --> 01:52:51.231
DOCUMENTATION THAT CURRENTLY

01:52:51.297 --> 01:52:52.699
EXISTS, AND NOT JUST LEAVE FOLKS

01:52:52.765 --> 01:52:54.300
WHO HAVE MAJOR GAPS HANGING,

01:52:54.367 --> 01:52:55.869
BECAUSE WE KNOW THE SYSTEMS THAT

01:52:55.935 --> 01:52:57.170
HAVE ERASED OUR HISTORY COME

01:52:57.237 --> 01:53:00.140
FROM THAT SAME THAT SAME HISTORY

01:53:00.206 --> 01:53:02.976
OF FAMILY ERASURE AND LAST NAME

01:53:03.042 --> 01:53:04.844
ERASURE, CULTURE ERASURE THAT IS

01:53:04.911 --> 01:53:06.546
A DIRECT AFTERLIFE OF SLAVERY.

01:53:06.613 --> 01:53:07.847
SO THAT'S NOT REALLY A QUESTION.

01:53:07.914 --> 01:53:09.949
THAT'S ME DOING MY BEST TO

01:53:10.016 --> 01:53:10.917
UNDERSTAND WHERE MY COLLEAGUE IS

01:53:10.984 --> 01:53:12.952
COMING FROM, AND WANT TO THANK

01:53:13.019 --> 01:53:14.120
Y'ALL FOR THE COMMENTS. I

01:53:14.187 --> 01:53:15.522
RESPECT I RESPECT YOUR CONCERNS

01:53:15.588 --> 01:53:16.756
AND YOUR CONCERNS ARE VERY

01:53:16.823 --> 01:53:19.726
VALID. WE HAVE LEADING EXPERTS

01:53:19.792 --> 01:53:21.694
IN GENETIC GENEALOGY, ONE I CAN

01:53:21.761 --> 01:53:23.263
NAME IN PARTICULAR BLAINE

01:53:23.329 --> 01:53:24.697
BETTINGER, WHO'S WRITTEN BOOKS

01:53:24.764 --> 01:53:26.699
ABOUT THE METHODOLOGIES INVOLVED

01:53:26.766 --> 01:53:27.934
IN TRACING GENEALOGY. AND THESE

01:53:28.001 --> 01:53:29.769
ARE THE CONCERNS THAT IN OUR

01:53:29.836 --> 01:53:30.904
INDUSTRY WE FACE ALL THE TIME.

01:53:30.970 --> 01:53:34.174
AND WE ARE TALKING WE DO TALK

01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:34.841
ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS THEM. THERE

01:53:34.908 --> 01:53:35.542
ARE MULTIPLE COMPANIES. IT'S NOT

01:53:35.608 --> 01:53:37.944
JUST ANCESTRY, IT'S NOT JUST 23.

01:53:38.011 --> 01:53:39.078
THERE'S MYHERITAGE, FAMILY TREE

01:53:39.145 --> 01:53:41.948
DNA. YES, YOU THERE WOULD BE.

01:53:42.015 --> 01:53:43.683
AND WE CAN GIVE OUR EXPERTISE

01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:45.818
AND ADVICE ON WHICH TOOLS THAT

01:53:45.885 --> 01:53:47.754
WE THINK ARE THE BEST. WE DON'T.

01:53:47.820 --> 01:53:49.455
WE'RE WE'RE IMPARTIAL TO ALL OF

01:53:49.522 --> 01:53:50.857
THEM, YOU KNOW. BUT WHAT

01:53:50.924 --> 01:53:52.659
HAPPENED WITH 23 ME IT IS IT'S

01:53:52.725 --> 01:53:54.861
SAD. IT'S A TRAGEDY AND I DO I

01:53:54.928 --> 01:53:55.828
DO RESPECT YOUR CONCERNS ON

01:53:55.895 --> 01:53:58.164
THAT. AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO

01:53:58.231 --> 01:53:58.865
GETTING TO KNOW YOU ON A

01:53:58.932 --> 01:54:00.633
PERSONAL LEVEL AND BETTER

01:54:00.700 --> 01:54:01.768
UNDERSTANDING. ABSOLUTELY. YOU

01:54:01.834 --> 01:54:02.802
KNOW HOW YOUR EXPERTISE CAN HELP

01:54:02.869 --> 01:54:04.737
INFORM THIS PROCESS BECAUSE I

01:54:04.804 --> 01:54:05.638
THINK WE'RE DOING REALLY

01:54:05.705 --> 01:54:06.706
IMPORTANT THINGS. ABSOLUTELY.

01:54:06.773 --> 01:54:07.674
THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU ALL. WE

01:54:07.740 --> 01:54:09.709
DO HAVE A MOTION ON THE TABLE.

01:54:09.776 --> 01:54:12.045
AND I THINK THAT I THINK THE

01:54:12.111 --> 01:54:12.879
CONVERSATION INDICATES THAT

01:54:12.946 --> 01:54:15.081
THERE. AND IT'S VERY COMMON AT A

01:54:15.148 --> 01:54:16.749
STATE LEVEL TO FIND A STATE

01:54:16.816 --> 01:54:19.285
AGENCY. IT COULD BE A CSU, IT

01:54:19.352 --> 01:54:20.153
COULD BE A DEPARTMENT TO

01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:21.955
ACTUALLY BE THE ONE THAT

01:54:22.021 --> 01:54:23.289
OVERSEES THIS TYPE OF PROCESS.

01:54:23.356 --> 01:54:24.190
AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING

01:54:24.257 --> 01:54:26.092
HERE. I THINK THAT YOU CLEARLY

01:54:26.159 --> 01:54:27.060
HAVE GREAT EXPERTISE, AND I HOPE

01:54:27.126 --> 01:54:30.196
YOU DO STAY CONNECTED WITH THE

01:54:30.263 --> 01:54:31.631
AUTHOR AND OFFER SOME OF THE

01:54:31.698 --> 01:54:33.466
OTHER FOLKS THAT YOU MIGHT KNOW,

01:54:33.533 --> 01:54:35.068
SO THAT WHEN IT DOES GET SET UP

01:54:35.134 --> 01:54:37.503
AT THE CSU, THEY ACTUALLY HAVE

01:54:37.570 --> 01:54:38.104
GENEALOGISTS THAT ARE EXPERTS

01:54:38.171 --> 01:54:39.872
THAT CAN HELP TO CREATE THAT

01:54:39.939 --> 01:54:40.673
FRAMEWORK. I DON'T THINK THERE'S

01:54:40.740 --> 01:54:42.442
A CONFLICT HERE. I CAN

01:54:42.508 --> 01:54:43.776
UNDERSTAND FRUSTRATION FROM THE

01:54:43.843 --> 01:54:45.078
COMMUNITY SEEING THAT, OH, THIS

01:54:45.144 --> 01:54:46.779
IS JUST GOING TO DELAY THE

01:54:46.846 --> 01:54:47.580
PROCESS. BUT THE REALITY IS, IF

01:54:47.647 --> 01:54:49.916
YOU DON'T HAVE A FRAMEWORK,

01:54:49.983 --> 01:54:50.750
THERE IS NO PROCESS. AND SO I

01:54:50.817 --> 01:54:53.553
THINK WITH THAT I WOULD OFFER

01:54:53.620 --> 01:54:55.054
THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE SENATOR

01:54:55.121 --> 01:54:56.756
TO CLOSE. WELL, THANK YOU VERY

01:54:56.823 --> 01:54:58.124
MUCH, CHAIR. I WANT TO

01:54:58.191 --> 01:54:58.891
DEFINITELY THANK YOU FOR YOUR

01:54:58.958 --> 01:55:00.426
CLOSING REMARKS BECAUSE YOU ARE

01:55:00.493 --> 01:55:02.528
SPOT ON. I WANT TO THANK THE

01:55:02.595 --> 01:55:03.863
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR

01:55:03.930 --> 01:55:05.665
YOUR QUESTIONS AND YOUR DIALOG.

01:55:05.732 --> 01:55:08.001
I WANT TO THANK MY FELLOW CBC

01:55:08.067 --> 01:55:09.369
MEMBER, ASSEMBLY MEMBER BRIAN,

01:55:09.435 --> 01:55:11.237
FOR BRINGING UP THE OTHER ISSUE,

01:55:11.304 --> 01:55:12.305
WHICH IS WHY IT WAS VERY

01:55:12.372 --> 01:55:14.107
IMPORTANT TO PUT IT AT A CSU,

01:55:14.173 --> 01:55:17.377
WHICH DEALS WITH PRIVACY. AND

01:55:17.443 --> 01:55:18.044
UNFORTUNATELY, WHAT WE'RE SEEING

01:55:18.111 --> 01:55:19.445
WITH SOME OF THESE PRIVATE

01:55:19.512 --> 01:55:21.547
COMPANIES IS THAT WHEN THEY

01:55:21.614 --> 01:55:22.749
START TO LOSE MONEY, THE FIRST

01:55:22.815 --> 01:55:25.318
THING THEY DO IS LOOK TO SELL

01:55:25.385 --> 01:55:26.552
OFF SOME OF THEIR INFORMATION,

01:55:26.619 --> 01:55:28.821
WHICH UNFORTUNATELY IS GENETIC

01:55:28.888 --> 01:55:29.956
INFORMATION OF THOSE WHO HAVE

01:55:30.023 --> 01:55:32.892
PUT THEIR TRUST IN THEM TO, TO

01:55:32.959 --> 01:55:35.695
RUN THEIR LINEAGE. AND SO THIS

01:55:35.762 --> 01:55:37.764
IS ACTUALLY A VERY IMPORTANT

01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:39.132
BILL. IT'S WHAT WE TALK ABOUT

01:55:39.198 --> 01:55:41.134
ALL THE TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE,

01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:43.303
WHICH IS ABOUT ESTABLISHING

01:55:43.369 --> 01:55:46.072
GUIDELINES, OVERSIGHT, GIVING

01:55:46.139 --> 01:55:48.308
CLEAR START DATE, END DATES,

01:55:48.374 --> 01:55:49.709
ENSURING THAT WHEN WE'RE GIVING

01:55:49.776 --> 01:55:51.544
MONEY OUT, WHEN WE'RE TASKING AN

01:55:51.611 --> 01:55:53.546
AGENCY AT THIS POINT IS TO CSU

01:55:53.613 --> 01:55:56.549
FOR THIS PARTICULAR BILL WITH A

01:55:56.616 --> 01:55:57.784
SPECIFIC TASK, THAT IT'S VERY

01:55:57.850 --> 01:55:59.752
CLEAR WHAT WE WANT THEM TO DO,

01:55:59.819 --> 01:56:01.187
THAT THEY ARE REQUIRED TO COME

01:56:01.254 --> 01:56:03.122
BACK AND GIVE US REPORTS. AND

01:56:03.189 --> 01:56:05.224
YET WE ALSO GIVE THEM THE

01:56:05.291 --> 01:56:06.659
FLEXIBILITY TO WORK WITH OTHERS

01:56:06.726 --> 01:56:08.461
OUTSIDE OF THE CSU. THAT MAY BE

MORE EXPERTS IN THAT PARTICULAR

01:56:10.663 --> 01:56:12.498

01:56:12.565 --> 01:56:13.933
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE

DESCENDANTS OF U.S CHATTEL

02:01:30.082 --> 02:01:32.618
SLAVERY HAD TO SUFFER, AND TO

02:01:32.685 --> 02:01:34.387
ADDRESS HISTORICAL AND ONGOING

02:01:34.453 --> 02:01:37.089
SYSTEMIC INJUSTICES. SENATE BILL

02:01:37.156 --> 02:01:38.824
518 IS IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE

02:01:38.891 --> 02:01:41.627
TASK FORCE REPORT, CHAPTER 18,

02:01:41.694 --> 02:01:45.531
PAGES 633 AND 634, RECOMMENDING

02:01:45.598 --> 02:01:48.367
THE FORMATION OF A BUREAU AS THE

02:01:48.434 --> 02:01:50.302

THE JAPANESE AMERICAN COMMUNITY

02:01:55.074 --> 02:01:57.009
HAS SOME EXPERIENCE WITH

02:01:57.076 --> 02:01:59.145
BUREAUS. I WAS INVOLVED IN THE

02:01:59.211 --> 02:02:00.713
MOVEMENT FOR REPARATIONS FOR

02:02:00.780 --> 02:02:02.715
JAPANESE AMERICANS INCARCERATED

02:02:02.782 --> 02:02:04.650
IN CONCENTRATION CAMPS. I WAS

02:02:04.717 --> 02:02:06.152
PART OF THE LEGAL TEAM THAT

02:02:06.218 --> 02:02:08.220

THE CIVIL LIBERTIES ACT OF 1988

02:02:17.997 --> 02:02:19.799

VERIFY ELIGIBILITY, TO

ADMINISTER BENEFITS, AND TO

02:02:26.372 --> 02:02:28.007
EDUCATE THE PUBLIC OF THIS

02:02:28.074 --> 02:02:30.609
WRONG. LIKEWISE, IT IS CRUCIAL

02:02:30.676 --> 02:02:32.545
THAT CALIFORNIA ESTABLISHES A

02:02:32.611 --> 02:02:34.113
SIMILAR FRAMEWORK TO CARRY OUT

02:02:34.180 --> 02:02:36.148
THE REPARATIVE POLICIES PASSED

02:02:36.215 --> 02:02:38.417
BY THE LEGISLATURE. OF COURSE,

02:02:38.484 --> 02:02:39.752
THIS WOULD INCLUDE A

02:02:39.819 --> 02:02:41.721
STANDARDIZED PROCESS FOR

IDENTIFICATION OF PERSONS WHOSE

02:02:45.324 --> 02:02:47.760
PROPERTY WAS UNJUSTLY SEIZED,

02:02:47.827 --> 02:02:49.562
PUBLIC EDUCATION. TO SHINE A

02:02:49.628 --> 02:02:52.031
LIGHT ON THIS CASCADING,

02:02:52.098 --> 02:02:53.933
CUMULATIVE, AND CONTINUING HARM

ORGANIZATION, AND WE RISE IN

02:04:13.345 --> 02:04:16.849
STRONG OPPOSITION TO SB 518. THE

BILL ITSELF PRESENTS THREE

02:04:19.385 --> 02:04:20.953
SERIOUS PROBLEMS THAT MUST NOT

02:04:21.020 --> 02:04:24.323
BE OVERLOOKED. FIRST, SB 518

02:04:24.390 --> 02:04:25.758
DUPLICATES AND OVERLAPS WITH

02:04:25.825 --> 02:04:28.994

DOJ AND THE OTHER THROUGH THE

02:04:36.135 --> 02:04:38.404
CSU SYSTEM. SO WHICH IS IT? THIS

02:04:38.470 --> 02:04:41.073
OVERLAP ONLY GUARANTEES DELAY,

02:04:41.140 --> 02:04:42.641
BUREAUCRACY AND CONFUSION, THE

EXACT OPPOSITE OF THE DECISIVE

02:04:44.076 --> 02:04:45.878

02:04:55.921 --> 02:04:58.390
BIGGEST LAW ENFORCEMENT BODIES.

02:04:58.457 --> 02:05:00.025
THIS MEANS THE MOST SENSITIVE

02:05:00.092 --> 02:05:02.127
DATA ABOUT OUR FAMILIES AND

02:05:02.194 --> 02:05:03.729
IDENTITIES COULD BE CONTROLLED

02:05:03.796 --> 02:05:05.297
BY THE SAME INSTITUTIONS THAT

02:05:05.364 --> 02:05:07.333
HAVE HISTORICALLY HARMED US. THE

02:05:07.399 --> 02:05:10.569
RISK OF SURVEILLANCE, MISUSE OR

02:05:10.636 --> 02:05:12.404

02:05:12.471 --> 02:05:14.673

02:05:23.282 --> 02:05:25.184
THE BUREAU'S SCOPE BEYOND

DESCENDANTS TO INCLUDE OTHER

02:05:27.686 --> 02:05:30.022
COMMUNITIES. THAT'S A BETRAYAL

02:05:30.089 --> 02:05:32.591
THAT DISRESPECTS OUR HISTORY. IT

02:05:32.658 --> 02:05:34.093
IGNORES THE SPECIFICITY OF OUR

02:05:34.159 --> 02:05:36.262
HARM AND VIOLATES THE CLEAR

FOR ANY QUESTIONS, COMMENTS OR

02:07:57.069 --> 02:08:02.875
MOTIONS. A MOTION. IS THERE A

02:08:02.941 --> 02:08:05.477

CHAIR, FURTHER CLARIFICATION AND

02:08:09.114 --> 02:08:11.917
I'LL ASK THE AUTHOR IF I. WELL,

02:08:11.984 --> 02:08:14.153
LET ME JUST STATE WHAT I THINK I

02:08:14.219 --> 02:08:16.655
UNDERSTAND. SO THIS IS TO CREATE

02:08:16.722 --> 02:08:18.424
WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

02:08:18.490 --> 02:08:20.225
THIS BODY OF INFORMATION THAT

02:08:20.292 --> 02:08:23.095
COMES FROM THE CSU STUDY. ARE

02:08:23.162 --> 02:08:25.731
THE TWO RELATED IN THAT WAY? SO

02:08:25.798 --> 02:08:28.567
THAT IS ONE PART OF THIS BUREAU.

02:08:28.634 --> 02:08:30.102
THE GENEALOGY DIVISION IS ONE

02:08:30.169 --> 02:08:32.905
PART. AND THE AMENDMENTS FROM

02:08:32.971 --> 02:08:35.074
THIS COMMITTEE, WHICH I KNOW YOU

02:08:35.140 --> 02:08:35.908
HAVE AND HOPEFULLY THEY'VE READ

02:08:35.974 --> 02:08:41.013
AS WELL, CLARIFY ANY QUESTION OF

02:08:41.080 --> 02:08:42.381
ANY CONFLICT WITH THE PREVIOUS

02:08:42.448 --> 02:08:48.053
BILL. OKAY. AS AS CREATING THE

02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:49.755
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AS THE

02:08:49.822 --> 02:08:51.990
REPOSITORY OF ALL THIS PERSONAL

02:08:52.057 --> 02:08:54.460
INFORMATION. MAY I ASK THE

02:08:54.526 --> 02:08:58.831
WITNESS? I HEARD YOUR COMMENTS.

02:08:58.897 --> 02:08:59.898
IS THAT A CONCERN? IS THAT

02:08:59.965 --> 02:09:01.100
SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE

02:09:01.166 --> 02:09:03.836
PROTECTED? IS THAT HAD YOU HAD

02:09:03.902 --> 02:09:04.937
THIS DISCUSSION BEFORE? THANK

02:09:05.003 --> 02:09:07.039
YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT. SO THE

02:09:07.106 --> 02:09:08.273
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WORKED

02:09:08.340 --> 02:09:10.342
VERY CLOSELY WITH THE CALIFORNIA

02:09:10.409 --> 02:09:12.144
REPARATIONS TASK FORCE, AND

02:09:12.211 --> 02:09:13.946
ACTUALLY WERE THE ONES THAT

02:09:14.012 --> 02:09:15.714
PRODUCED THE 1100 PLUS PAGE

02:09:15.781 --> 02:09:18.550
REPORT. VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT

02:09:18.617 --> 02:09:20.552
THE THINGS THAT HAVE OCCURRED,

02:09:20.619 --> 02:09:21.553
THE HISTORY, THE THINGS THAT

02:09:21.620 --> 02:09:23.589
NEED TO HAPPEN. ADDITIONALLY,

02:09:23.655 --> 02:09:25.958
THEY HAVE THE LEGAL SUPPORT IF

02:09:26.024 --> 02:09:27.993
THERE ARE ANY ISSUES WHERE

02:09:28.060 --> 02:09:29.862
SOMEONE MAY NEED SOME LEGAL

02:09:29.928 --> 02:09:32.564
ASSISTANCE. WE ARE IN CONTINUED

02:09:32.631 --> 02:09:34.199
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

02:09:34.266 --> 02:09:35.567
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND A

02:09:35.634 --> 02:09:36.969
COUPLE OF OTHER DEPARTMENTS, SO

02:09:37.035 --> 02:09:38.036
THIS MAY NOT BE WHERE IT

02:09:38.103 --> 02:09:39.838
ULTIMATELY LANDS, BUT AS OF

02:09:39.905 --> 02:09:41.807
RIGHT NOW, THIS IS WHERE IT IS.

02:09:41.874 --> 02:09:43.108
AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

02:09:43.175 --> 02:09:44.510
HAS DONE TREMENDOUS WORK IN THE

02:09:44.576 --> 02:09:46.245
AREA OF REPARATIONS HERE IN

02:09:46.311 --> 02:09:48.780
CALIFORNIA. OKAY. CAN I ASK A

02:09:48.847 --> 02:09:50.215
QUESTION? SO JUST IF I COULD

02:09:50.282 --> 02:09:51.850
JUST YOUR QUESTION, MEMBER AND

02:09:51.917 --> 02:09:52.951
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION, BY

02:09:53.018 --> 02:09:55.220
THE WAY. VICE VICE VICE CHAIR.

02:09:55.287 --> 02:09:56.922
SO I WAS AT EVERY SINGLE

02:09:56.989 --> 02:09:57.489
CALIFORNIA REPARATIONS TASK

02:09:57.556 --> 02:09:59.992
FORCE HEARING EVERY SINGLE

02:10:00.058 --> 02:10:03.729
MOMENT OF THEM. AND I CAN TELL

02:10:03.795 --> 02:10:05.964
YOU FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

02:10:06.031 --> 02:10:07.699
THAT WITH RESPECT TO THE DOJ, I

02:10:07.766 --> 02:10:09.601
KNOW A LOT OF THE STAFF THERE. A

02:10:09.668 --> 02:10:11.069
LOT OF THE STAFF DID GREAT WORK,

02:10:11.136 --> 02:10:12.638
BUT THERE WERE SERIOUS CONCERNS

02:10:12.704 --> 02:10:13.939
AND SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH THE

02:10:14.006 --> 02:10:14.806
DOJ'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE

02:10:14.873 --> 02:10:16.041
CALIFORNIA REPARATIONS TASK

02:10:16.108 --> 02:10:17.743
FORCE PROCESS FROM DAY ONE.

02:10:17.809 --> 02:10:19.611
ACTUALLY, FROM THE FIRST HEARING

02:10:19.678 --> 02:10:21.480
THAT MEMBER TAMAKI, YOU'RE HERE,

02:10:21.547 --> 02:10:24.349
YOU CAN SPEAK TO THIS TO THERE

02:10:24.416 --> 02:10:25.617
WERE SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH WITH

02:10:25.684 --> 02:10:29.188
THE DOJ'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE

02:10:29.254 --> 02:10:29.755
CALIFORNIA REPARATIONS TASK

02:10:29.821 --> 02:10:32.157
FORCE PROCESS. SO THAT'S THE

02:10:32.224 --> 02:10:34.159
FIRST POINT. SECOND POINT, IS

02:10:34.226 --> 02:10:37.796
THE SENATORS CORRECT? YEAH. THE

02:10:37.863 --> 02:10:41.066
DOJ KNOWS A LOT ABOUT THE

02:10:41.133 --> 02:10:42.034
PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY WERE PART

02:10:42.100 --> 02:10:43.535
OF CREATING THE PROBLEM IN THE

02:10:43.602 --> 02:10:45.337
FIRST PLACE. THEY'RE PART OF THE

02:10:45.404 --> 02:10:46.572
REASON WHY WE NEED REPARATIONS

02:10:46.638 --> 02:10:48.607
IN THE FIRST PLACE. OKAY. WHY

02:10:48.674 --> 02:10:49.641
WOULD YOU PUT WHY WOULD YOU PUT

02:10:49.708 --> 02:10:52.344
OUR REPARATIONS PROCESS INSIDE

02:10:52.411 --> 02:10:54.446
OF THE STATE'S AND THE COUNTRY'S

02:10:54.513 --> 02:10:55.714
LARGEST LAW ENFORCEMENT BODY?

02:10:55.781 --> 02:10:57.416
IT'S DISRESPECTFUL. IT'S A

02:10:57.482 --> 02:10:58.850
LITTLE RACIST, TO BE QUITE

02:10:58.917 --> 02:11:00.185
HONEST WITH YOU. OKAY. YOU PUT

02:11:00.252 --> 02:11:02.454
THE BLACK PEOPLE STUFF, ALL

02:11:02.521 --> 02:11:04.890
RIGHT? AS I REMEMBER, BRIAN. THE

02:11:04.957 --> 02:11:07.459
BLACK PEOPLE STUFF INSIDE OF THE

02:11:07.526 --> 02:11:08.627
INSIDE OF THE DEPARTMENT. OKAY.

02:11:08.694 --> 02:11:11.129
SO SORRY. ARE YOU. ARE YOU

02:11:11.196 --> 02:11:13.131
ASKING THE QUESTION? YEAH, THE

02:11:13.198 --> 02:11:16.435
CHAIR'S QUESTION. AND WITH NO

02:11:16.501 --> 02:11:17.703
FURTHER QUESTION POSED TO YOU.

02:11:17.769 --> 02:11:20.339
BUT IF THERE IS ONE, WE'LL GO

02:11:20.405 --> 02:11:21.573
AHEAD. OKAY. THANK YOU. FINISH

02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:24.710
MY STATEMENT AND I WILL BE. THE

02:11:24.776 --> 02:11:27.613
FINAL POINT IS THERE IS SERIOUS

02:11:27.679 --> 02:11:29.014
CONFLICT AGAIN WITH THIS BILL

02:11:29.081 --> 02:11:31.617
AND SB FIVE AND SB 437. AND

02:11:31.683 --> 02:11:33.885
THOSE NEED TO BE ADDRESSED

02:11:33.952 --> 02:11:35.721
BEFORE THESE BILLS MOVE FORWARD.

02:11:35.787 --> 02:11:36.922
THANK YOU. THANK YOU, ASSEMBLY

02:11:36.989 --> 02:11:38.924
MEMBER BRIAN. THANK YOU, MR.

02:11:38.991 --> 02:11:39.791
CHAIR. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU,

02:11:39.858 --> 02:11:42.194
CHRIS. LIKEWISE. I THINK WHEN

02:11:42.261 --> 02:11:43.161
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

02:11:43.228 --> 02:11:45.697
PROTECTION OF DATA, I THINK

02:11:45.764 --> 02:11:47.032
THAT'S PART OF THE CONVERSATION

02:11:47.099 --> 02:11:48.834
MIKE AND I WERE JUST HAVING, YOU

02:11:48.900 --> 02:11:50.435
KNOW, AND I DON'T DISAGREE WITH

02:11:50.502 --> 02:11:51.870
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE BEING

02:11:51.937 --> 02:11:53.472
A COMPLICATED ENTITY. AND IN

02:11:53.538 --> 02:11:54.273
FACT, I THINK PROSECUTORS AND

02:11:54.339 --> 02:11:55.807
FEDERAL PROSECUTORS AND ALL OF

02:11:55.874 --> 02:11:57.609
THEM HAVE BEEN VERY COMPLICATED

02:11:57.676 --> 02:11:59.077
FOR THE HISTORY OF BLACK FOLKS

02:11:59.144 --> 02:12:00.679
AND WORKING WITH THEM, WHETHER

02:12:00.746 --> 02:12:01.947
THEY WERE FORMERLY ASSEMBLY

02:12:02.014 --> 02:12:02.714
MEMBERS OR NOT, IS A VERY

02:12:02.781 --> 02:12:04.883
COMPLICATED POSITION TO BE IN. I

02:12:04.950 --> 02:12:05.851
WILL SAY THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:12:05.917 --> 02:12:08.754
JUSTICE HOUSES THE OFFICE OR THE

02:12:08.820 --> 02:12:10.622
DIVISION OF CIVIL RIGHTS.

02:12:10.689 --> 02:12:11.590
CURRENTLY, THE DIVISION OF CIVIL

02:12:11.657 --> 02:12:13.825
RIGHTS THEN TRANSITIONED INTO A

02:12:13.892 --> 02:12:15.560
DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL RIGHTS IN

02:12:15.627 --> 02:12:18.196
2022. RIGHT NOW, IT'S MY

02:12:18.263 --> 02:12:19.231
UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE'S NO

02:12:19.298 --> 02:12:20.799
MONEY IN THE STATE BUDGET FOR

02:12:20.866 --> 02:12:22.634
EITHER AN AGENCY OR A DIVISION

02:12:22.701 --> 02:12:24.036
OR BUREAU, WHICH MEANS IF

02:12:24.102 --> 02:12:25.203
ANYTHING IS TO GET ESTABLISHED,

02:12:25.270 --> 02:12:27.105
IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO TAKE SOME

02:12:27.172 --> 02:12:27.673
INCREDIBLE LIFTING FROM THE

02:12:27.739 --> 02:12:29.107
BLACK CAUCUS, BECAUSE THAT'S

02:12:29.174 --> 02:12:30.108
ONGOING FUNDS. WE'RE NOT TALKING

02:12:30.175 --> 02:12:31.910
ABOUT ONE TIME MONEY. WE'RE

02:12:31.977 --> 02:12:32.911
TALKING ABOUT ONGOING MONEY

02:12:32.978 --> 02:12:36.114
DURING A DEFICIT. I THINK

02:12:36.181 --> 02:12:37.816
BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE IS

02:12:37.883 --> 02:12:39.618
IMPORTANT AND REFUSING TO BUILD

02:12:39.685 --> 02:12:41.053
INFRASTRUCTURE OR STOPPING ANY

02:12:41.119 --> 02:12:42.387
STEP TOWARDS BUILDING THAT

02:12:42.454 --> 02:12:43.989
INFRASTRUCTURE, WHETHER IT'S A

02:12:44.056 --> 02:12:45.824
DIVISION, WHEREVER, MADAM CHAIR,

02:12:45.891 --> 02:12:47.659
YOU DECIDE TO PUT A BUREAU,

02:12:47.726 --> 02:12:48.860
WHETHER IT'S IN THE DEPARTMENT

02:12:48.927 --> 02:12:50.629
OF CIVIL RIGHTS, THE DEPARTMENT

02:12:50.696 --> 02:12:51.730
OF JUSTICE OR SOME OTHER PLACE

02:12:51.797 --> 02:12:54.099
THAT YOU THINK IT BELONGS, AS

02:12:54.166 --> 02:12:56.601
YOU SCALE UP TO A FULL BLOWN

02:12:56.668 --> 02:12:58.070
AGENCY. I THINK THAT'S PART OF

02:12:58.136 --> 02:12:59.438
HOW GOVERNMENT INFRASTRUCTURE

02:12:59.504 --> 02:13:01.273
GETS BUILT. MY BIGGER FEAR IS

02:13:01.340 --> 02:13:04.376
THAT NEITHER HAPPENS BECAUSE OF

02:13:04.443 --> 02:13:06.244
DISTRACTIONS THIS YEAR, AND THE

02:13:06.311 --> 02:13:09.748
EASY OUT TO NOT DO ANYTHING

02:13:09.815 --> 02:13:11.383
BUDGETARILY BECAUSE FOLKS ARE

02:13:11.450 --> 02:13:14.186
CONFUSED BY SPECTACLES LIKE

02:13:14.252 --> 02:13:16.355
THIS. AND SO YOU HAVE MY SUPPORT

02:13:16.421 --> 02:13:18.924
TODAY, AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT THE

02:13:18.990 --> 02:13:20.726
ADVOCACY OF YOU AND THE MEMBERS

02:13:20.792 --> 02:13:22.427
OF THE BLACK CAUCUS CAN SECURE

02:13:22.494 --> 02:13:24.329
ONGOING FUNDING TO BUILD THIS

02:13:24.396 --> 02:13:25.831
AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE,

02:13:25.897 --> 02:13:27.532
BECAUSE, AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED

02:13:27.599 --> 02:13:28.934
TODAY AND MANY OTHER DAYS, WE

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.937
SHOULD NOT DELAY ANY FURTHER.

02:13:32.003 --> 02:13:32.904
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

02:13:32.971 --> 02:13:34.740
THE GOVERNOR TO PUT DOLLARS INTO

02:13:34.806 --> 02:13:36.475
THIS EFFORT. AND I THINK IT'S

02:13:36.541 --> 02:13:38.377
IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE TO PUT

02:13:38.443 --> 02:13:39.478
EFFORTS IN THIS. AND I'M HOPING

02:13:39.544 --> 02:13:40.512
THERE'S FUTURE BUDGET TRAILER

02:13:40.579 --> 02:13:42.381
BILLS COMING DOWN THE LINE THAT

02:13:42.447 --> 02:13:44.783
INCLUDE PRIORITIES FOR BLACK

02:13:44.850 --> 02:13:45.617
CALIFORNIANS. AND THAT'S

02:13:45.684 --> 02:13:47.052
CERTAINLY WHAT I KNOW YOUR FOCUS

02:13:47.119 --> 02:13:49.154
IS THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THIS

02:13:49.221 --> 02:13:49.788
SESSION. THANK YOU, THANK YOU,

02:13:49.855 --> 02:13:52.124
THANK YOU. MAY I ADD ONE THING

02:13:52.190 --> 02:13:53.325
IN DEFENSE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:13:53.392 --> 02:13:55.694
JUSTICE, BRIEFLY, PART OF THE

02:13:55.761 --> 02:13:58.497
YOU KNOW, THE MEMBER AND IT

02:13:58.563 --> 02:14:00.899
PRODUCED A MAGNIFICENT,

02:14:00.966 --> 02:14:02.334
MONUMENTAL PIECE OF WORK. THIS

02:14:02.401 --> 02:14:04.970
1100 PAGE REPORT WILL BE

02:14:05.036 --> 02:14:06.671
REFERENCED IN CALIFORNIA AND

02:14:06.738 --> 02:14:09.274
NATIONWIDE. AND THESE ARE FOLKS

02:14:09.341 --> 02:14:11.410
WHO WORK DAY AND NIGHT TO PUT

02:14:11.476 --> 02:14:14.012
THIS TOGETHER. THIS DEPARTMENT

02:14:14.079 --> 02:14:17.582
OF JUSTICE WAS REALLY

02:14:17.649 --> 02:14:18.950
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SUCCESS OF

02:14:19.017 --> 02:14:20.886
THE TASK FORCE, AND IT WOULD NOT

02:14:20.952 --> 02:14:22.454
HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE FOR ITS

02:14:22.521 --> 02:14:23.889
EFFORTS. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR

02:14:23.955 --> 02:14:26.691
COMMENTS? WELL, I DO WANT TO

02:14:26.758 --> 02:14:30.028
THANK THE AUTHOR. AND LOOK, YOU

02:14:30.095 --> 02:14:33.532
KNOW, EVERYTHING ABOUT OUR

02:14:33.598 --> 02:14:35.934
DEMOCRACY, OR AT LEAST AS LONG

02:14:36.001 --> 02:14:38.170
AS WE HAVE. IT IS COMPLICATED.

02:14:38.236 --> 02:14:39.337
THE SAME SUPREME COURT THAT

02:14:39.404 --> 02:14:40.705
DECIDED THE DRED SCOTT CASE IS

02:14:40.772 --> 02:14:42.741
THE SAME. SUPREME COURT DECIDED.

02:14:42.808 --> 02:14:44.242
BROWN VERSUS BOARD OF EDUCATION,

02:14:44.309 --> 02:14:46.845
THE SAME DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

02:14:46.912 --> 02:14:51.583
THAT HAS IMPOSED CRUELTY UPON

02:14:51.650 --> 02:14:52.651

THIS POINT IS NOT ECONOMICALLY

02:17:43.822 --> 02:17:45.857

UNDERGIRD THEM CONTINUE TO

02:23:12.850 --> 02:23:15.219
EVOLVE, WE MUST ACT TO INTERRUPT

02:23:15.286 --> 02:23:17.588
THESE ANTICOMPETITIVE SCHEMES

02:23:17.655 --> 02:23:19.057
AND THE TOOLS THAT FACILITATE

02:23:19.123 --> 02:23:20.959
THE UNDERMINING OF A FAIR AND

HEPPNER. I'M AN ANTITRUST

02:24:02.033 --> 02:24:03.101
ATTORNEY AND SENIOR COUNSEL AT

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC LIBERTIES

02:24:04.669 --> 02:24:06.270
PROJECT, WHERE WE HAVE BEEN

02:24:06.337 --> 02:24:07.071
STUDYING THE PROLIFERATION OF

02:24:07.138 --> 02:24:08.706
PRICE FIXING ALGORITHMS ACROSS

02:24:08.773 --> 02:24:10.375
THE ECONOMY AND WITHIN THE

02:24:10.441 --> 02:24:11.776
RENTAL HOUSING MARKET. WE

02:24:11.843 --> 02:24:13.511
AUTHORED A REPORT LAST YEAR ON

02:24:13.578 --> 02:24:15.480
THE PROLIFERATION OF RENT FIXING

02:24:15.546 --> 02:24:16.080
ALGORITHMS. SPECIFICALLY, IN

02:24:16.147 --> 02:24:18.750
THIS YEAR, 18 STATES HAVE

02:24:18.816 --> 02:24:20.451
INTRODUCED BILLS TO ADDRESS THIS

02:24:20.518 --> 02:24:21.819
PROBLEM. ANOTHER DOZEN ATTORNEY

02:24:21.886 --> 02:24:23.354
GENERALS HAVE BROUGHT CASES. THE

02:24:23.421 --> 02:24:24.355
BIDEN JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS

02:24:24.422 --> 02:24:26.257
BROUGHT A CASE AGAINST REALPAGE,

02:24:26.324 --> 02:24:27.325
AND WE HAVE EVERY REASON TO

02:24:27.392 --> 02:24:27.959
BELIEVE THAT THE TRUMP

02:24:28.026 --> 02:24:29.060
ADMINISTRATION IS CONTINUING

02:24:29.127 --> 02:24:31.262
THAT CASE. ONE OF THE LEADING

02:24:31.329 --> 02:24:32.697
PRIVATE PRIVATE CASES IS PENDING

02:24:32.764 --> 02:24:34.365
HERE IN THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF

02:24:34.432 --> 02:24:35.967
CALIFORNIA. RENT FIXING IS AN

02:24:36.034 --> 02:24:36.968
EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO THE FAIR

02:24:37.035 --> 02:24:38.636
FUNCTIONING OF HOUSING MARKETS.

02:24:38.703 --> 02:24:40.138
AN ECONOMIC STUDY BY THE WHITE

02:24:40.204 --> 02:24:43.875
HOUSE ESTIMATED THAT TENANTS PAY

02:24:43.941 --> 02:24:45.209
$3.8 BILLION MORE IN RENT PER

02:24:45.276 --> 02:24:47.078
YEAR, DUE DIRECTLY TO THE

02:24:47.145 --> 02:24:48.212
PROLIFERATION OF THESE RENT

02:24:48.279 --> 02:24:50.415
FIXING ALGORITHMS. THE

02:24:50.481 --> 02:24:52.417
LEGISLATURE HAS WORKED VERY HARD

02:24:52.483 --> 02:24:54.252
TO INCREASE HOUSING SUPPLY, AND

02:24:54.318 --> 02:24:55.987
RENT FIXING ALGORITHMS ALSO

02:24:56.054 --> 02:24:57.455
PROVIDE A RESTRAINT ON NEW

02:24:57.522 --> 02:24:59.791
HOUSING SUPPLY. BLOCKING HOUSING

02:24:59.857 --> 02:25:02.226
STARTS AND LEAVING UNITS VACANT.

02:25:02.293 --> 02:25:02.894
FURTHERMORE, WE KNOW THAT

02:25:02.960 --> 02:25:04.796
BUILDING NEW HOUSING INTO A

02:25:04.862 --> 02:25:06.264
RIGGED MARKET IS NOT GOING TO

02:25:06.330 --> 02:25:08.099
DELIVER THE LOWER RENTS PROMISED

02:25:08.166 --> 02:25:10.001
BY THAT NEW SUPPLY. FOR THESE

02:25:10.068 --> 02:25:11.135
REASONS, THE SUPREME COURT HAS

02:25:11.202 --> 02:25:12.870
CALLED PRICE FIXING THE SUPREME

02:25:12.937 --> 02:25:15.473
EVIL OF ANTITRUST. THE PROBLEM

02:25:15.540 --> 02:25:16.941
HERE BEFORE YOU HAS ELICITED TWO

02:25:17.008 --> 02:25:18.676
KEY POLICY RESPONSES THAT ARE

02:25:18.743 --> 02:25:20.144
DISTINCT AND COMPLEMENTARY. THE

02:25:20.211 --> 02:25:22.547
FIRST IS A BAN ON NONPUBLIC DATA

02:25:22.613 --> 02:25:24.415
EXCHANGES. OBVIOUSLY, THERE IS

02:25:24.482 --> 02:25:26.217
NO RATIONAL REASON FOR A

02:25:26.284 --> 02:25:27.552
COMPETING LANDLORD TO SHARE

02:25:27.618 --> 02:25:30.154
THEIR SENSITIVE DATA WITH THEIR

02:25:30.221 --> 02:25:31.756
COMPETITORS, BUT FOR THEIR

02:25:31.823 --> 02:25:33.825
PARTICIPATION IN SOME TYPE OF

02:25:33.891 --> 02:25:34.425
ILLEGAL SCHEME TO COORDINATE.

02:25:34.492 --> 02:25:36.327
BUT NONPUBLIC DATA EXCHANGES ARE

02:25:36.394 --> 02:25:38.496
ONLY ONE WAY TO INFER THE

02:25:38.563 --> 02:25:40.665
ILLEGAL AGREEMENT. SO ANOTHER

02:25:40.731 --> 02:25:43.568
CATEGORY OF POLICIES USE

02:25:43.634 --> 02:25:46.904
CONFRONT THE USE OF ALGORITHMS

02:25:46.971 --> 02:25:48.606
TO COORDINATE PRICING STRATEGIES

02:25:48.673 --> 02:25:50.741
ACROSS COMPETITORS. HERE, THE

02:25:50.808 --> 02:25:52.810
INTENT IS ALSO TO PRESERVE THE

02:25:52.877 --> 02:25:54.412
COMPETITIVE INTENSITY OF THAT

02:25:54.479 --> 02:25:56.514
PRICE SETTING PROCESS. AND WE'VE

02:25:56.581 --> 02:25:57.915
REFERRED TO THESE PROPOSALS AS

02:25:57.982 --> 02:26:01.252
BANS ON ON COMMON PRICING

02:26:01.319 --> 02:26:02.253
ALGORITHMS. THE BILL BEFORE YOU

02:26:02.320 --> 02:26:04.088
SEEKS TO BAN BOTH OF THESE

02:26:04.155 --> 02:26:05.890
PRACTICES, AS WAS A RECENT BILL

02:26:05.957 --> 02:26:07.658
THAT WAS SUCCESSFUL IN COLORADO,

02:26:07.725 --> 02:26:09.160
AT LEAST THE LEGISLATURE

02:26:09.227 --> 02:26:11.295
RECENTLY. THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

02:26:11.362 --> 02:26:13.331

ORDER TO BE A VIOLATION, THERE

COMBINATION WITH THE FORM OF A

02:29:37.401 --> 02:29:39.270
TWO OR MORE PERSONS. SO WE'RE

02:29:39.337 --> 02:29:40.671
INDICATING THAT THAT LANGUAGE IS

02:29:40.738 --> 02:29:42.940
NOT NEEDED. WE'VE REQUESTED

02:29:43.007 --> 02:29:46.143
CLEAR LANGUAGE ON VIOLATIONS. WE

02:29:46.210 --> 02:29:48.045
REQUESTED THAT THE LANGUAGE

02:29:48.112 --> 02:29:49.347
PROVIDE THAT PART OF THE

02:29:49.413 --> 02:29:51.315
CONTRACT, OR THE CONSPIRACY TO

02:29:51.382 --> 02:29:53.451
RESTRAIN TRADE OR COMMERCE MAKES

02:29:53.517 --> 02:29:56.253
IT ILLEGAL IN AND OF ITSELF. SB

02:29:56.320 --> 02:29:58.756
52 ONLY APPLIES THIS RULE TO THE

02:29:58.823 --> 02:30:00.791
USERS OF PRICING PRICING

02:30:00.858 --> 02:30:02.393
ALGORITHMS, BUT NOT TO THE

02:30:02.460 --> 02:30:04.028
PEOPLE WHO CREATE AND DISTRIBUTE

02:30:04.095 --> 02:30:05.896
THEM. THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO

02:30:05.963 --> 02:30:07.898
US, AND BOTH SHOULD BE HELD TO

02:30:07.965 --> 02:30:10.301
THE SAME STANDARD. WITHOUT THIS,

02:30:10.368 --> 02:30:12.370
THE LAW WOULD BE UNFAIRLY

02:30:12.436 --> 02:30:15.272
REQUIRE A STRICTER RULE FOR THE

02:30:15.339 --> 02:30:18.209
USERS, BUT AN EASIER ONE FOR THE

02:30:18.275 --> 02:30:20.277
DISTRIBUTORS. WE'VE ALSO

02:30:20.344 --> 02:30:21.645
REQUESTED THAT INTERNET LISTING

02:30:21.712 --> 02:30:23.647
SERVICES CONTINUE IN THE BILL,

02:30:23.714 --> 02:30:25.716
SUCH AS ZILLOW AND

02:30:25.783 --> 02:30:27.518
APARTMENTS.COM. WE THINK THIS

02:30:27.585 --> 02:30:31.155
PROVIDES COMPETITION. THE BOTTOM

02:30:31.222 --> 02:30:32.723
LINE IS THAT WE WANT TO ENSURE

02:30:32.790 --> 02:30:35.760
THAT SB 52 DOESN'T MAKE THE VERY

02:30:35.826 --> 02:30:37.628
PROBLEM IT PURPORTS TO SOLVE

02:30:37.695 --> 02:30:39.296
MUCH MORE DIFFICULT. WE BELIEVE

02:30:39.363 --> 02:30:41.565
THAT COMPETITION, AND AT LEAST

02:30:41.632 --> 02:30:43.401
INFORMATION THAT'S LISTED WILL

02:30:43.467 --> 02:30:45.469
HELP CONSUMERS. THANK YOU, THANK

02:30:45.536 --> 02:30:47.838
YOU. ANYONE ELSE HERE IN

02:30:47.905 --> 02:30:51.242

02:33:15.686 --> 02:33:18.489
THANKING SENATOR PEREZ AND ALSO

02:33:18.556 --> 02:33:20.624
JUDICIARY STAFF FOR WORKING SO

02:33:20.691 --> 02:33:21.592
CLOSELY WITH THE PRIVACY

02:33:21.659 --> 02:33:23.127
COMMITTEE ON THIS BILL. I THINK

02:33:23.193 --> 02:33:24.595
IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. I

02:33:24.662 --> 02:33:26.497
THINK WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

02:33:26.564 --> 02:33:27.665
AFFORDABILITY BEING THE THING WE

02:33:27.731 --> 02:33:30.100
SHOULD BE LASER FOCUSED ON FOR

02:33:30.167 --> 02:33:31.835
CALIFORNIANS, I THINK THIS IS

02:33:31.902 --> 02:33:33.337
ACTUALLY MOVING THE NEEDLE FOR

02:33:33.404 --> 02:33:34.371
AFFORDABILITY FOR CALIFORNIANS

02:33:34.438 --> 02:33:36.173
IN A REAL AND MEANINGFUL WAY.

02:33:36.240 --> 02:33:39.777
AND, YOU KNOW, ANTITRUST SINCE

02:33:39.843 --> 02:33:42.313
THE RAILROADS HAS BEEN HOW

02:33:42.379 --> 02:33:45.783
COMPANIES GOUGE CITIZENS. AND

02:33:45.849 --> 02:33:48.319
THIS IS THE MODERN ANTITRUST

02:33:48.385 --> 02:33:49.253
VIOLATION IS THROUGH THESE TECH

02:33:49.320 --> 02:33:51.255
TOOLS THAT ARE ALLOWING

02:33:51.322 --> 02:33:53.457
INDUSTRIES TO COLLUDE BEHIND

02:33:53.524 --> 02:33:56.393
BLACK BOXES AND RAISE PRICES FOR

02:33:56.460 --> 02:33:58.729
REAL PEOPLE. AND SO YOUR WORK ON

02:33:58.796 --> 02:34:00.831
THIS, I THINK, IS LAUDABLE AND

02:34:00.898 --> 02:34:02.399
REALLY IMPORTANT. AND SO I'M

02:34:02.466 --> 02:34:03.901
HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL AND

02:34:03.968 --> 02:34:05.469
SUPPORT IT. TODAY. I WILL SAY MY

02:34:05.536 --> 02:34:07.771
ONE REMAINING CONCERN IS THAT WE

02:34:07.838 --> 02:34:08.405
HAVE FOUR BILLS MOVING THROUGH

02:34:08.472 --> 02:34:10.307
THE LEGISLATURE THAT ARE NOT

02:34:10.374 --> 02:34:11.809
EVEN NECESSARILY ALL CONSISTENT

02:34:11.875 --> 02:34:13.210
WITH ONE ANOTHER RIGHT NOW. AND

02:34:13.277 --> 02:34:15.446
I DO THINK IT IS INCUMBENT UPON

02:34:15.512 --> 02:34:17.181
US TO DO THIS, TO MAKE SURE

02:34:17.247 --> 02:34:19.650
THESE AND YOU ACTUALLY HAVE THE

02:34:19.717 --> 02:34:22.886
SMALLEST BILLS, TO BE FRANK. BUT

02:34:22.953 --> 02:34:24.822
I AS A FORMER REGULATORY LAWYER,

02:34:24.888 --> 02:34:26.056
I'D BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T SAY

02:34:26.123 --> 02:34:27.725
THAT IF WE DO NOT MAKE THESE

02:34:27.791 --> 02:34:29.460
BILLS WORK TOGETHER, THEN WE ARE

02:34:29.526 --> 02:34:31.028
CREATING A MORASS OF REGULATION

02:34:31.095 --> 02:34:32.997
AND LAW THAT WILL MAKE IT HARD

02:34:33.063 --> 02:34:34.732
FOR CALIFORNIANS TO BENEFIT FROM

02:34:34.798 --> 02:34:35.566
THESE REALLY IMPORTANT EFFORTS

02:34:35.633 --> 02:34:37.801
THAT ARE BEING PUT IN. SO I HOPE

02:34:37.868 --> 02:34:38.936
ALL FOUR AUTHORS WILL WORK

02:34:39.003 --> 02:34:40.537
TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:34:40.604 --> 02:34:42.339
PUT FORWARD A COHESIVE PIECE OF

02:34:42.406 --> 02:34:43.707
LEGISLATION THAT TRULY PROTECTS

02:34:43.774 --> 02:34:44.875
CALIFORNIANS AS WE COME TO THE

02:34:44.942 --> 02:34:47.011
END OF THE SESSION, AND I KNOW

02:34:47.077 --> 02:34:48.679
THAT I WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

02:34:48.746 --> 02:34:51.115
TO BE A PART OF THAT, AND I HOPE

02:34:51.181 --> 02:34:52.182
WE CAN CONTINUE THAT

02:34:52.249 --> 02:34:52.950
CONVERSATION. THANK YOU. THANK

02:34:53.017 --> 02:34:54.385
YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S ZUBIATE.

02:34:54.451 --> 02:34:55.653
SO I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR.

02:34:55.719 --> 02:34:57.187
I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTING ALL

02:34:57.254 --> 02:34:58.822
THREE OF THESE BILLS IN THIS

02:34:58.889 --> 02:35:01.458
AREA, AND I JUST WANT TO ECHO MY

02:35:01.525 --> 02:35:02.626
COLLEAGUES COMMENTS. I THINK ONE

02:35:02.693 --> 02:35:05.462
OF THE HARD THINGS ABOUT HAVING

02:35:05.529 --> 02:35:06.964
SO MANY BILLS IS THE GOAL IS NOT

02:35:07.031 --> 02:35:08.399
WHAT ANYONE EVERYONE SUPPORTS

02:35:08.465 --> 02:35:10.134
THE GOAL, EVEN THE OPPONENTS

02:35:10.200 --> 02:35:12.269
SUPPORT THE GOAL. IT'S THE

02:35:12.336 --> 02:35:14.605
DETAILS THAT MATTER. AND I THINK

02:35:14.672 --> 02:35:16.607
IT WOULD BE GOOD IF SORT OF ALL

02:35:16.674 --> 02:35:17.741
THESE BILLS CAME TOGETHER SO

02:35:17.808 --> 02:35:19.243
THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY FOCUS ON

02:35:19.309 --> 02:35:20.811
THE DETAILS AND MAKE SURE THAT

02:35:20.878 --> 02:35:22.046
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AREN'T

02:35:22.112 --> 02:35:23.814
OCCURRING. I GUESS I'M SORT OF

02:35:23.881 --> 02:35:26.583
NEWER TO THIS. JUST HAD A COUPLE

02:35:26.650 --> 02:35:28.952
QUESTIONS. ONE IS, CAN YOU GIVE

02:35:29.019 --> 02:35:31.822
ME SOME EXAMPLES OF THE OF WHAT

02:35:31.889 --> 02:35:34.158
WOULD BE NONPUBLIC DATA

02:35:34.224 --> 02:35:37.127
EXCHANGES VERSUS DATA EXCHANGES.

02:35:37.194 --> 02:35:38.462
AND SO I ASSUME YOU'RE NOT

02:35:38.529 --> 02:35:42.566
TRYING TO ELIMINATE WEBSITES

02:35:42.633 --> 02:35:45.369

02:36:24.641 --> 02:36:27.077
APARTMENTS.COM OR ZILLOW? THE

02:36:27.144 --> 02:36:31.448
YEAH, YEAH. SO IT'S SO YES AS.

02:36:31.515 --> 02:36:34.618
ASSEMBLYMEMBER BAUER MENTIONED,

02:36:34.685 --> 02:36:37.020
REALPAGE WOULD BE THE I THINK

02:36:37.087 --> 02:36:39.389
THE BEST EXAMPLE OF A WEBSITE

02:36:39.456 --> 02:36:40.758
THAT THAT HAS BEEN DOING THAT.

02:36:40.824 --> 02:36:42.326
THAT'S WHY YOU'VE SEEN CASES

02:36:42.392 --> 02:36:43.761
BROUGHT FORWARD BY THE US

02:36:43.827 --> 02:36:44.661
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, AS WELL

02:36:44.728 --> 02:36:47.164
AS OUR OWN DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

02:36:47.231 --> 02:36:49.066
HERE IN THE STATE, BECAUSE THEY

02:36:49.133 --> 02:36:52.369
ARE ALLOWING FOR FOLKS TO

02:36:52.436 --> 02:36:54.438
COLLUDE USING PRIVATE DATA. SO

02:36:54.505 --> 02:36:57.641
NOT APARTMENTS.COM, NOT NOT

02:36:57.708 --> 02:36:59.109
ZILLOW.COM, BUT THERE'S BEEN

02:36:59.176 --> 02:37:00.711
LAWSUITS BROUGHT AGAINST

02:37:00.778 --> 02:37:02.279
PARTICULARLY THAT TECH WEBSITE.

02:37:02.346 --> 02:37:03.814
BUT THEY I MEAN, RIGHT NOW

02:37:03.881 --> 02:37:05.816
BECAUSE THERE'S WE DON'T HAVE

02:37:05.883 --> 02:37:06.850
LAWS AGAINST THIS. I MEAN THEY

02:37:06.917 --> 02:37:08.919
COULD CERTAINLY INSTITUTE THESE

02:37:08.986 --> 02:37:09.953
TYPES OF SYSTEMS. THIS IS WHY

02:37:10.020 --> 02:37:11.622
WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO GET AHEAD

02:37:11.688 --> 02:37:13.791
OF THIS AND PREVENT THIS AT LEE.

02:37:13.857 --> 02:37:14.792
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU

02:37:14.858 --> 02:37:16.660
WANT TO MENTION? EITHER ONE OF

02:37:16.727 --> 02:37:17.694
YOU. SO I THINK THAT THE ONLY

02:37:17.761 --> 02:37:20.197
THING THAT I'D ADD IS THAT THIS,

02:37:20.264 --> 02:37:21.331
THIS BILL ABSOLUTELY HAS TO

02:37:21.398 --> 02:37:23.367
ENCOURAGE FAIR AND OPEN MARKET

02:37:23.433 --> 02:37:24.735
RESEARCH USING PUBLIC DATA. AND

02:37:24.802 --> 02:37:26.570
THAT IS THE INTENT OF THE BILL.

02:37:26.637 --> 02:37:28.839
THAT IS THE BILL. TEXT NÓ. I

02:37:28.906 --> 02:37:31.208
THINK THE GOAL IS IMPORTANT AND

02:37:31.275 --> 02:37:33.177
LAUDABLE. AND THAT'S WHY I'M

02:37:33.243 --> 02:37:34.144
GOING TO SUPPORT ALL OF THESE

02:37:34.211 --> 02:37:35.579
TODAY. I DO THE ONE OTHER THING

02:37:35.646 --> 02:37:36.914
I JUST WANTED TO PICK UP, I

02:37:36.980 --> 02:37:39.550
THINK FROM WHAT THE OPPONENTS

02:37:39.616 --> 02:37:44.454
RAISED WAS. THE FOCUS ON THE

02:37:44.521 --> 02:37:46.723
CREATORS AND THE DISTRIBUTORS OF

02:37:46.790 --> 02:37:48.492
THESE ALGORITHMS AND THE WEB

02:37:48.559 --> 02:37:49.993
PAGES. I MEAN, TO ME, THE THING

02:37:50.060 --> 02:37:52.729
I WOULD WORRY ABOUT IS AN

02:37:52.796 --> 02:37:54.565
INNOCENT LANDLORD COMING IN AND

02:37:54.631 --> 02:37:56.834
FILLING OUT A FORM AND OBVIOUSLY

02:37:56.900 --> 02:37:58.569
PROVIDING INFORMATION THAT MIGHT

02:37:58.635 --> 02:38:00.704
THEN BECOME PUBLIC OR IS NOT

02:38:00.771 --> 02:38:03.640
SHARED PUBLICLY ON THE SITE, BUT

02:38:03.707 --> 02:38:05.375
IS PART OF A FORM THAT'S FILLED

02:38:05.442 --> 02:38:06.643
OUT AND YOU'VE GOT INNOCENT

02:38:06.710 --> 02:38:07.978
PEOPLE SORT OF COMING IN JUST

02:38:08.045 --> 02:38:09.479
TRYING TO GET THEIR APARTMENT

02:38:09.546 --> 02:38:11.515
LISTED OR THEIR HOME RENTED AND

02:38:11.582 --> 02:38:13.016
DOING WHAT THE ALGORITHM IS. YOU

02:38:13.083 --> 02:38:15.485
KNOW, WHAT THE COMPANY IS ASKING

02:38:15.552 --> 02:38:17.120
THEM TO PROVIDE. I MEAN, I DO

02:38:17.187 --> 02:38:19.289
THAT ALL THE TIME IN WHEN I'M,

02:38:19.356 --> 02:38:21.258
YOU KNOW, GOING ON TRAVEL

02:38:21.325 --> 02:38:22.659
WEBSITES. I'M, I PROVIDE THE

02:38:22.726 --> 02:38:23.894
INFORMATION THAT I NEED TO

02:38:23.961 --> 02:38:25.495
BECAUSE I CAN'T GET TO THE NEXT

02:38:25.562 --> 02:38:27.331
SCREEN IF I DON'T. SO I REALLY

02:38:27.397 --> 02:38:29.499
HOPE THAT YOU'LL FOCUS ON THE

02:38:29.566 --> 02:38:32.102
FOLKS THAT ARE CREATING THESE

02:38:32.169 --> 02:38:34.638
THINGS AND THINK ABOUT THE FACT

02:38:34.705 --> 02:38:36.039
THAT WE'VE GOT, YOU KNOW, MOM

02:38:36.106 --> 02:38:37.875
AND POP LANDLORDS THAT WE

02:38:37.941 --> 02:38:39.576
REALLY, YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK

02:38:39.643 --> 02:38:41.144
THEY'RE SORT OF IN A MASTERMIND

02:38:41.211 --> 02:38:43.647
SCHEME OF CONSPIRACY AND THAT WE

02:38:43.714 --> 02:38:45.515
TRY TO FOCUS ON REALLY THE FOLKS

02:38:45.582 --> 02:38:46.683
THAT ARE CREATING THESE THINGS.

02:38:46.750 --> 02:38:49.286
SO THAT WOULD BE MY COMMENT.

02:38:49.353 --> 02:38:50.387
YEAH. YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN,

02:38:50.454 --> 02:38:50.988
ASSEMBLYMEMBER. AND, YOU KNOW,

02:38:51.054 --> 02:38:52.556
BOTH OF MY PARENTS ARE SMALL MOM

02:38:52.623 --> 02:38:54.458
AND POP LANDLORDS. THEY EACH

02:38:54.524 --> 02:38:55.759
INDIVIDUALLY, YOU KNOW, OWN

02:38:55.826 --> 02:38:56.927
THEIR OWN PROPERTY. SO I

02:38:56.994 --> 02:38:59.062
UNDERSTAND THAT CONCERN. AND,

02:38:59.129 --> 02:39:01.798
YOU KNOW, I, I'M NOT TRYING TO

02:39:01.865 --> 02:39:03.433
DO ANY FAVORS FOR OUR TECH

02:39:03.500 --> 02:39:04.868
OVERLORDS. SO, YOU KNOW,

02:39:04.935 --> 02:39:06.336
DEFINITELY LOOKING TO MAKE SURE

02:39:06.403 --> 02:39:08.805
THAT WE'RE WE'RE HOLDING THEM

02:39:08.872 --> 02:39:10.607
ACCOUNTABLE AS WELL. AND WE'VE

02:39:10.674 --> 02:39:12.776
HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

02:39:12.843 --> 02:39:14.878
OPPOSITION TO AND TAKING THEIR

02:39:14.945 --> 02:39:16.113
FEEDBACK INTO ACCOUNT AS WE'VE

02:39:16.179 --> 02:39:17.748
BEEN MOVING THIS FORWARD. SO

02:39:17.814 --> 02:39:19.583
IT'S VERY MUCH BEEN, I THINK, A

02:39:19.650 --> 02:39:22.452
PARTICIPATORY PROCESS. SO YEAH.

02:39:22.519 --> 02:39:25.622
THANK YOU. MADAM VICE CHAIR.

02:39:25.689 --> 02:39:27.624
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. I ACTUALLY

02:39:27.691 --> 02:39:29.626
I ECHO WHAT ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S MY

02:39:29.693 --> 02:39:32.663
COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA MONICA,

02:39:32.729 --> 02:39:34.731
WHEN I SEE THESE BILLS

02:39:34.798 --> 02:39:35.832
REPEATEDLY NOW OVER SEVERAL

02:39:35.899 --> 02:39:38.568
YEARS, THE TENANT ADVOCATE BILLS

02:39:38.635 --> 02:39:41.905
I FEEL AND I HAVE NO DOG IN THIS

02:39:41.972 --> 02:39:44.207
FIGHT FOR SMALL, SMALL OR LARGE

02:39:44.274 --> 02:39:46.176
OR SMALL LANDLORDS, PARTICULARLY

02:39:46.243 --> 02:39:47.711
THESE, AS WE'VE DISCUSSED IN

02:39:47.778 --> 02:39:50.480
OTHER HEARINGS, SMALL LANDLORDS

02:39:50.547 --> 02:39:52.249
ARE REALLY THE CORE OF THE

02:39:52.316 --> 02:39:54.117
RENTAL HOUSING MARKET, AND THEY

02:39:54.184 --> 02:39:57.888
OWN DUPLEXES AND WHATNOT. AND I

02:39:57.955 --> 02:39:59.556
REMEMBER A YEAR AGO I SPOKE ON A

02:39:59.623 --> 02:40:01.725
TENANT RIGHTS BILL, AND I HAD

02:40:01.792 --> 02:40:03.760
ASKED MY STAFF AT THAT TIME HOW

02:40:03.827 --> 02:40:05.662
MANY TENANT RIGHTS BILLS HAVE

02:40:05.729 --> 02:40:07.497
BEEN MADE INTO LAW IN THE LAST

02:40:07.564 --> 02:40:09.366
FIVE YEARS. WELL, NOW IT'S WE'RE

02:40:09.433 --> 02:40:11.034
STILL PILING ON, PILING ON,

02:40:11.101 --> 02:40:12.769
PILING ON, IN MY OPINION. I

02:40:12.836 --> 02:40:14.638
MEAN, IN TERMS OF ALGORITHMS

02:40:14.705 --> 02:40:16.840
WITH ANY LANDLORD, BUT

02:40:16.907 --> 02:40:19.776
ESPECIALLY SMALL LANDLORDS WHO

02:40:19.843 --> 02:40:21.511
ARE JUST TRYING TO GET

02:40:21.578 --> 02:40:22.679
INFORMATION SO THEY CAN PRICE

02:40:22.746 --> 02:40:25.983
THEIR UNITS IN AN ECONOMICALLY

02:40:26.049 --> 02:40:27.985
AND TO RECOVER THEIR OPERATING

02:40:28.051 --> 02:40:29.820
COSTS, WHICH IS ANY SMALL

02:40:29.886 --> 02:40:32.456
BUSINESS WOULD DO, AND TO IMPOSE

02:40:32.522 --> 02:40:35.325
A THREAT OF CRIMINAL PENALTIES

02:40:35.392 --> 02:40:38.228
THAT THEY ACCESSED INFORMATION

02:40:38.295 --> 02:40:41.531
THAT WAS NOT PUBLIC. I, I JUST

02:40:41.598 --> 02:40:44.968
I'M SYMPATHETIC TO MAKING SURE

02:40:45.035 --> 02:40:47.004
THAT TENANTS HAVE THEIR RIGHTS.

02:40:47.070 --> 02:40:49.706
OF COURSE, ANY GROUP ANYWHERE IN

02:40:49.773 --> 02:40:50.707
AMERICA MUST HAVE THEIR RIGHTS.

02:40:50.774 --> 02:40:53.510
BUT WE ARE MAKING BEING A WE ARE

02:40:53.577 --> 02:40:56.013
PASSING LAWS IN A CUMULATIVE

02:40:56.079 --> 02:40:57.848
WAY. BUT NOW THIS IS ANOTHER

02:40:57.914 --> 02:41:01.118
EXAMPLE OF MAKING SMALL LANDLORD

02:41:01.184 --> 02:41:04.054
OWNERSHIP HIGHLY ONEROUS IN

02:41:04.121 --> 02:41:05.122
CALIFORNIA. AND I DON'T KNOW

02:41:05.188 --> 02:41:06.757
WHAT THE OVERALL INTENT IS. I

02:41:06.823 --> 02:41:08.625
THIS IS A RHETORICAL STATEMENT.

02:41:08.692 --> 02:41:09.993
ARE WE TRYING TO DRIVE EVERYONE

02:41:10.060 --> 02:41:11.728
WHO OWNS AN APARTMENT OR DUPLEX

02:41:11.795 --> 02:41:13.096
OUT OF BUSINESS? BECAUSE DOING

02:41:13.163 --> 02:41:14.398
BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA, WHETHER

02:41:14.464 --> 02:41:16.299
IT'S AN APARTMENT OWNER OR RUN

02:41:16.366 --> 02:41:18.068
AN ICE CREAM SHOP, IT'S VERY,

02:41:18.135 --> 02:41:19.903
VERY DIFFICULT. NOW THEY HAVE TO

02:41:19.970 --> 02:41:21.204
BE CAREFUL. ARE THEY VIOLATING

02:41:21.271 --> 02:41:23.473
THE LAW? IF THEY ACCESS A MARKET

02:41:23.540 --> 02:41:24.941
DATA THAT IS USED JUST TO GIVE

02:41:25.008 --> 02:41:26.643
THEM A FRAMEWORK, A PERSPECTIVE

02:41:26.710 --> 02:41:28.879
OF WHAT RENTAL RATES ARE IN

02:41:28.945 --> 02:41:31.314
THEIR PARTICULAR NEIGHBORHOOD OR

02:41:31.381 --> 02:41:33.083
AREA? WHY DO WE NEED THESE KINDS

02:41:33.150 --> 02:41:35.018
OF LAWS THAT ARE TRYING TO SNUFF

02:41:35.085 --> 02:41:37.054
OUT SMALL BUSINESS PEOPLE? IF

02:41:37.120 --> 02:41:38.822
THERE'S UNFAIRNESS, FINE. BUT A

02:41:38.889 --> 02:41:41.358
CRIMINAL PENALTY SUBJECT TO

02:41:41.425 --> 02:41:42.959
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO A

02:41:43.026 --> 02:41:46.229
LANDLORD AND I JUST I CAN'T

02:41:46.296 --> 02:41:47.964
SUPPORT, I GUESS, ONE MORE BILL,

02:41:48.031 --> 02:41:49.699
ONE MORE BILL, ONE MORE BILL.

02:41:49.766 --> 02:41:51.468
EVERYBODY WANTS TO GO AFTER THE

02:41:51.535 --> 02:41:52.169
LANDLORDS WHEN THEY'RE JUST

02:41:52.235 --> 02:41:53.937
TRYING TO PROVIDE HOUSING AND A

02:41:54.004 --> 02:41:55.772
STATE THAT HAS VERY LIMITED

02:41:55.839 --> 02:41:58.008
HOUSING SUPPLY. SO IT'S NOT THE

02:41:58.075 --> 02:41:59.476
LANDLORDS NECESSARILY. WE KNOW

02:41:59.543 --> 02:42:01.178
WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS EVERYWHERE

02:42:01.244 --> 02:42:03.780
ELSE ABOUT THE HOUSING CRISIS IN

02:42:03.847 --> 02:42:05.615
CALIFORNIA. LANDLORDS ARE DOING

02:42:05.682 --> 02:42:07.384
A GOOD AND NOBLE SERVICE TO

02:42:07.451 --> 02:42:09.786
PROVIDING RENTAL PROPERTIES.

02:42:09.853 --> 02:42:11.421
LET'S LET THEM MAKE A DECENT

02:42:11.488 --> 02:42:14.157
BUSINESS OUT OF IT AND PROVIDE

02:42:14.224 --> 02:42:15.659
HOUSING THAT'S NEEDED AND NOT

02:42:15.725 --> 02:42:17.027
CONSTRAIN THEM ANY FURTHER. SO

02:42:17.094 --> 02:42:18.395
SORRY TO COME DOWN ON THIS, BUT

02:42:18.462 --> 02:42:20.697
I JUST I HAVE SYMPATHY FOR THE

02:42:20.764 --> 02:42:22.766
SMALL LANDLORD. YEAH. THANK YOU.

02:42:22.833 --> 02:42:24.334
YOU KNOW, FIRST OF ALL,

02:42:24.401 --> 02:42:25.802
ASSEMBLYMEMBER DIXON, I

02:42:25.869 --> 02:42:26.870
APPRECIATE THE CONCERN. AS I

02:42:26.937 --> 02:42:28.238
MENTIONED BEFORE, BOTH OF MY

02:42:28.305 --> 02:42:29.940
PARENTS ARE SMALL MOM AND POP

02:42:30.006 --> 02:42:31.775
LANDLORDS. THEY DON'T UTILIZE

02:42:31.842 --> 02:42:33.543
SERVICES LIKE THIS. AND I THINK

02:42:33.610 --> 02:42:36.079
IN MANY WAYS, ACTUALLY, THESE

02:42:36.146 --> 02:42:37.247
KINDS OF SERVICES AND THESE

02:42:37.314 --> 02:42:39.216
TYPES OF TOOLS ACTUALLY PUT A

02:42:39.282 --> 02:42:41.184
LOT OF SMALL MOM AND POP

02:42:41.251 --> 02:42:42.586
LANDLORDS AT A COMPLETE

02:42:42.652 --> 02:42:44.421
DISADVANTAGE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT

02:42:44.488 --> 02:42:45.956
NECESSARILY THE FOLKS THAT ARE

02:42:46.022 --> 02:42:47.991
UTILIZING THESE THINGS. SO THEY

02:42:48.058 --> 02:42:49.893
CAN ACTUALLY BE HURT THROUGH

02:42:49.960 --> 02:42:52.462
THIS PROCESS. WE'VE SEEN THESE

02:42:52.529 --> 02:42:54.431
TOOLS BE UTILIZED TO RAISE RENTS

02:42:54.498 --> 02:42:56.800
OVER 100% IN SOME CASES. I THINK

02:42:56.867 --> 02:42:58.602
THERE WAS AN EXAMPLE IN TEXAS

02:42:58.668 --> 02:43:00.036
WHERE RATES WERE DRIVEN UP,

02:43:00.103 --> 02:43:01.805
RENTS WERE DRIVEN UP OVER 400%

02:43:01.872 --> 02:43:04.941
IN A SINGLE YEAR. AND SO IF

02:43:05.008 --> 02:43:06.743
YOU'RE PAYING FOR THIS TOOL, YOU

02:43:06.810 --> 02:43:08.178
CERTAINLY BENEFIT FROM IT. BUT

02:43:08.245 --> 02:43:11.348
IF YOU'RE NOT UTILIZING IT, THEN

02:43:11.414 --> 02:43:12.616
THEN, THEN YOU'RE BEING HURT BY

02:43:12.682 --> 02:43:14.684
IT AS WELL. SO AND I'D LOVE TO

02:43:14.751 --> 02:43:16.553
HAVE I THINK LET ME JUST

02:43:16.620 --> 02:43:17.854
INTERJECT THERE. DID YOU SAY THE

02:43:17.921 --> 02:43:19.122
STATE OF TEXAS? YES. THIS IS

02:43:19.189 --> 02:43:20.123
SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING

02:43:20.190 --> 02:43:22.192
ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY WILL

02:43:22.259 --> 02:43:23.360
DETERMINE IF YOU OWN AN

02:43:23.426 --> 02:43:25.362
APARTMENT BUILDING AND YOU'RE

02:43:25.428 --> 02:43:26.963
CHARGING THREE TIMES MORE THAN

02:43:27.030 --> 02:43:29.699
THE LANDLORD, THEN YOU'RE NOT

02:43:29.766 --> 02:43:31.535
GOING TO GET VERY FAR IN A

02:43:31.601 --> 02:43:33.637
MARKET THAT YOU HAVE INVESTMENTS

02:43:33.703 --> 02:43:35.038
THAT YOU MAKE TO KEEP THE

02:43:35.105 --> 02:43:37.174
APARTMENT LOOKING NICE AND WELL

02:43:37.240 --> 02:43:38.441
MAINTAINED. AND THE COMPETITIVE

02:43:38.508 --> 02:43:40.343
RATES IN THE MARKETPLACE WILL

02:43:40.410 --> 02:43:42.312
SORT THAT OUT. BUT JUST

02:43:42.379 --> 02:43:43.813
UNWITTINGLY, IF SOMEBODY WERE,

02:43:43.880 --> 02:43:45.682
OH MY GOSH, I HEARD THAT THERE'S

02:43:45.749 --> 02:43:46.750
SOME INFORMATION ABOUT RENTAL

02:43:46.816 --> 02:43:48.084
RATES IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD, I'LL

02:43:48.151 --> 02:43:49.653
CHECK IT. AND THEN BOOM, THEY'VE

02:43:49.719 --> 02:43:52.522
JUST VIOLATED THE LAW. I THINK,

02:43:52.589 --> 02:43:53.657
MADAM VICE CHAIR, THIS BILL

02:43:53.723 --> 02:43:55.192
WOULD ALLOW FOR THOSE MARKET

02:43:55.258 --> 02:43:56.526
FORCES TO ACTUALLY BE THE

02:43:56.593 --> 02:43:58.195
DRIVING FORCE BEHIND WHAT RENTAL

02:43:58.261 --> 02:43:59.896
RATES ARE ACTUALLY PUT FORTH

02:43:59.963 --> 02:44:01.831
PUBLICLY. WHAT THIS BILL IS

02:44:01.898 --> 02:44:03.600
SEEKING TO ADDRESS IS THE NON

02:44:03.667 --> 02:44:05.135
MARKET DATA AND INFORMATION

02:44:05.202 --> 02:44:06.770
UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES.

02:44:06.836 --> 02:44:08.171
BUT WE WOULD HAVE NO BUSINESS

02:44:08.238 --> 02:44:10.106
INTEREST IN SHARING WITH

02:44:10.173 --> 02:44:11.942
COMPETITORS USING THAT

02:44:12.008 --> 02:44:14.511
INFORMATION IN ORDER. BUT THAT'S

02:44:14.578 --> 02:44:15.645
WHAT THIS THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL

02:44:15.712 --> 02:44:17.681
IS TARGETING IS THAT KIND OF

02:44:17.747 --> 02:44:18.315
INFORMATION THAT WOULDN'T

02:44:18.381 --> 02:44:20.250
ORDINARILY BE SHARED BY

02:44:20.317 --> 02:44:22.118
LANDLORDS AND USING IT TO

02:44:22.185 --> 02:44:23.186
ADVANTAGE THE LANDLORDS OVER

02:44:23.253 --> 02:44:24.554
RENTERS IN TERMS OF WHAT PRICING

02:44:24.621 --> 02:44:25.822
IS DONE, IF IT'S JUST MARKET

02:44:25.889 --> 02:44:28.558
FORCES? I THINK WE ALL SUPPORT

02:44:28.625 --> 02:44:29.626
THAT. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL

02:44:29.693 --> 02:44:32.162
ACTUALLY ENCOURAGES. AND ALSO,

02:44:32.229 --> 02:44:33.530
ONE MORE NOTE. THERE ARE NO

02:44:33.597 --> 02:44:35.098
CRIMINAL PENALTIES IN THIS BILL.

02:44:35.165 --> 02:44:37.968
THERE ARE CIVIL CIVIL PENALTIES

02:44:38.034 --> 02:44:38.902
AND RESTITUTION. ASSEMBLYMEMBER

02:44:38.969 --> 02:44:41.504
BRIAN NØ, THANK YOU, MISTER

02:44:41.571 --> 02:44:44.641
CHAIR, FOR CLARIFYING THE CIVIL

02:44:44.708 --> 02:44:45.942
PENALTIES. AND I MEAN WHAT'S

02:44:46.009 --> 02:44:46.943
FAIR AND WHAT'S RIGHT. ALSO,

02:44:47.010 --> 02:44:48.878
REALLY GOOD TO SEE YOU OUT OF

02:44:48.945 --> 02:44:50.714
THE BOOT AND HOPING THE RECOVERY

02:44:50.780 --> 02:44:54.718
STAYS SPEEDY. I AGREE WITH THE

02:44:54.784 --> 02:44:56.886
CHAIR OF OUR PRIVACY COMMITTEE

02:44:56.953 --> 02:44:57.887
AS A MEMBER OF HER COMMITTEE,

02:44:57.954 --> 02:44:59.623
THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF BILLS IN

02:44:59.689 --> 02:45:01.725
THIS SPACE, AND WE'VE GOT TO

02:45:01.791 --> 02:45:03.727
FIGURE OUT HOW TO CHAPTER THEM

02:45:03.793 --> 02:45:05.528
OUT AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY ALL

02:45:05.595 --> 02:45:06.563
BUILD ON TOP OF EACH OTHER. I

02:45:06.630 --> 02:45:08.064
ALMOST HAD ANOTHER BILL TO THIS,

02:45:08.131 --> 02:45:09.666
BUT INSTEAD DECIDED TO JOIN MY

02:45:09.733 --> 02:45:11.067
COLLEAGUE FROM PASADENA IN HER

02:45:11.134 --> 02:45:13.036
EFFORTS BECAUSE I THINK THEY'RE

02:45:13.103 --> 02:45:13.737
RIGHTEOUS AND THEY ARE ON POINT.

02:45:13.803 --> 02:45:16.006
THIS ISN'T ABOUT STOPPING THE

02:45:16.072 --> 02:45:17.240
MARKET FROM ADJUSTING TO THE

02:45:17.307 --> 02:45:18.675
NEED OF BOTH RENTERS AND MOM AND

02:45:18.742 --> 02:45:19.876
POP LANDLORDS. IT'S ABOUT

02:45:19.943 --> 02:45:21.311
STOPPING PRIVATE COLLUSION AND

02:45:21.378 --> 02:45:24.681
PRICE FIXING WITH PRIVATE DATA

02:45:24.748 --> 02:45:25.782
THAT'S NOT ACCESSIBLE TO MOM AND

02:45:25.849 --> 02:45:28.218
POP LANDLORDS. I DIDN'T REALLY

02:45:28.285 --> 02:45:29.819
WANT TO SPEAK, BUT JUST WANTED

02:45:29.886 --> 02:45:31.454
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT MY

02:45:31.521 --> 02:45:32.522
COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY WHO

02:45:32.589 --> 02:45:34.791
I LOVE DEARLY, SAID GOOD

02:45:34.858 --> 02:45:36.326
BUSINESS. THERE IS NO INCENTIVE

02:45:36.393 --> 02:45:37.560
TO DO GOOD BUSINESS WITH

02:45:37.627 --> 02:45:38.628
SOMEBODY'S HOUSING THAT ALLOWS

02:45:38.695 --> 02:45:39.896
FOR POOR AND STRUGGLING PEOPLE

02:45:39.963 --> 02:45:41.598
TO KEEP A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD.

02:45:41.665 --> 02:45:43.900
IT'S VERY HARD FOR US TO ADDRESS

02:45:43.967 --> 02:45:44.534
THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS, WHILE

02:45:44.601 --> 02:45:45.902
ALSO ADVOCATING FOR WHATEVER IS

02:45:45.969 --> 02:45:48.705
IN THE BEST INTEREST FROM AN

02:45:48.772 --> 02:45:49.339
INVESTMENT STANDPOINT, WHEN IT

02:45:49.406 --> 02:45:51.207
COMES TO TREATING HOUSING AS A

02:45:51.274 --> 02:45:51.941
COMMODITY INSTEAD OF A HUMAN

02:45:52.008 --> 02:45:53.710
RIGHT LIKE IT IS AND LIKE IT

02:45:53.777 --> 02:45:55.845
SHOULD BE. AND SO WHILE WE'VE

02:45:55.912 --> 02:45:57.881
HAD A NUMBER OF TENANT RIGHTS

02:45:57.947 --> 02:45:58.448
BILLS, I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN

02:45:58.515 --> 02:45:59.115
DISAPPOINTED, BY AND LARGE, WITH

02:45:59.182 --> 02:45:59.983
THIS LEGISLATURE'S FOCUS ON

02:46:00.050 --> 02:46:01.451
TENANT PROTECTIONS. WE'VE HAD

02:46:01.518 --> 02:46:02.452
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE KILLED. A

02:46:02.519 --> 02:46:06.323
COUPLE OF MINE INCLUDED THE WE

02:46:06.389 --> 02:46:07.490
CAN'T HAVE AN HONEST

02:46:07.557 --> 02:46:08.925
CONVERSATION ABOUT AFFORDABILITY

02:46:08.992 --> 02:46:10.994
AND NOT TALK ABOUT HOUSING,

02:46:11.061 --> 02:46:12.829
SPECIFICALLY THE COST OF RENT.

02:46:12.896 --> 02:46:15.098
THE RENT IS TOO DAMN HIGH, AND

02:46:15.165 --> 02:46:16.266
THERE ARE TOO MANY FORCES AT

02:46:16.333 --> 02:46:18.668
PLAY THAT ARE NOT ALLOWING FOR

02:46:18.735 --> 02:46:20.904
POOR AND STRUGGLING AND WORKING

02:46:20.970 --> 02:46:21.771
FAMILIES TO KEEP A ROOF OVER

02:46:21.838 --> 02:46:23.740
THEIR HEAD. THAT'S WHAT THIS

02:46:23.807 --> 02:46:24.841
AUTHOR IS TRYING TO ADDRESS AS

02:46:24.908 --> 02:46:26.042
WE MERGE WITH EMERGING

02:46:26.109 --> 02:46:27.243
TECHNOLOGIES AND ARTIFICIAL

02:46:27.310 --> 02:46:28.411
INTELLIGENCE, AND THE USE OF

02:46:28.478 --> 02:46:32.282
THOSE QUANTUM SYSTEMS TO PRICE

02:46:32.349 --> 02:46:33.750
FIX A MARKET THAT IS ALREADY

02:46:33.817 --> 02:46:35.552
PRICING PEOPLE OUT. SO I WANT TO

02:46:35.618 --> 02:46:36.820
THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING

02:46:36.886 --> 02:46:38.588
THIS FORWARD. I BELIEVE I'M

02:46:38.655 --> 02:46:39.923
ALREADY A COAUTHOR, AND I WILL

02:46:39.989 --> 02:46:41.791
MOVE THE BILL. OH, THERE'S A

02:46:41.858 --> 02:46:43.159
MOTION. ARE YOU THE SECOND THEN

02:46:43.226 --> 02:46:45.695
WE'LL TAKE. YEAH, YEAH. SENATOR

02:46:45.762 --> 02:46:47.964
BAUER KI¾M. YEAH. I JUST WANTED

02:46:48.031 --> 02:46:49.566
TO BRIEFLY GROUND US IN THE

02:46:49.632 --> 02:46:51.401
BILL, BECAUSE I THINK IT IS

02:46:51.468 --> 02:46:52.869
IMPORTANT THAT I AM SOMEONE WHO

02:46:52.936 --> 02:46:54.404
BELIEVES DEEPLY IN FREE MARKETS

02:46:54.471 --> 02:46:57.907
AND COMPETITION. BUT WE AS A

02:46:57.974 --> 02:46:59.275
COUNTRY HAVE AGREED THAT WHEN

02:46:59.342 --> 02:47:01.177
COLLUSION IS HAPPENING, THAT

02:47:01.244 --> 02:47:02.512
THAT BREAKS THE FREE MARKET AND

02:47:02.579 --> 02:47:03.913
THAT BREAKS THOSE HEALTHY

02:47:03.980 --> 02:47:06.116
FORCES. AND SO WE HAVE ANTITRUST

02:47:06.182 --> 02:47:07.183
LAWS TO PREVENT THAT. AND I

02:47:07.250 --> 02:47:08.918
THINK THAT IS WHAT FUNDAMENTALLY

02:47:08.985 --> 02:47:10.820
THIS IS GETTING AT. AND, YOU

02:47:10.887 --> 02:47:12.655
KNOW, THE SENATOR SPOKE BRIEFLY

02:47:12.722 --> 02:47:14.224
ABOUT THE REALPAGE EXAMPLE, BUT

02:47:14.290 --> 02:47:16.893
WHAT WAS HAPPENING THERE WAS,

02:47:16.960 --> 02:47:18.728
YOU KNOW, THESE TOOLS ARE

02:47:18.795 --> 02:47:21.331
GETTING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF DATA

02:47:21.398 --> 02:47:23.099
FROM THE PEOPLE WHO ARE USING

02:47:23.166 --> 02:47:24.501
THESE TOOLS, AND THEN THEY'RE

02:47:24.567 --> 02:47:26.269
USING ALL OF THAT DATA TO MAKE

02:47:26.336 --> 02:47:28.204
MARKET ANALYTICS AND BASICALLY

02:47:28.271 --> 02:47:30.006
DO WHAT USED TO HAPPEN IN SMOKE

02:47:30.073 --> 02:47:31.841
FILLED ROOMS AND SAY, OKAY, WE

02:47:31.908 --> 02:47:33.643
CAN SET THE PRICE AT THIS, AND

02:47:33.710 --> 02:47:35.779
YOU CAN ALL GO TO THIS AND IT'LL

02:47:35.845 --> 02:47:37.480
WORK OUT. AND WE DON'T ALLOW

02:47:37.547 --> 02:47:38.081
THAT WHEN IT'S HAPPENING IN

02:47:38.148 --> 02:47:40.316
SMOKE FILLED ROOMS. SO WE ALSO

02:47:40.383 --> 02:47:42.786
SHOULD NOT ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN IN

02:47:42.852 --> 02:47:44.320
ALGORITHMS. NOW, THAT ISN'T TO

02:47:44.387 --> 02:47:45.922
SAY THAT I'M A SMALL LANDLORD

02:47:45.989 --> 02:47:49.292
AND LIKE YOUR PARENTS, I GO ON

02:47:49.359 --> 02:47:49.926
TO APARTMENTS.COM AND I LOOK AT

02:47:49.993 --> 02:47:51.561
WHAT THE MARKET RATE IS. THAT'S

02:47:51.628 --> 02:47:53.463
HOW I'M SURE YOUR PARENTS DECIDE

02:47:53.530 --> 02:47:55.498
TO SET THE RENT TOO. IT'S A

02:47:55.565 --> 02:47:56.499
NATURAL. THAT IS A NATURAL

02:47:56.566 --> 02:47:58.034
MARKET FORCE AND THAT IS

02:47:58.101 --> 02:47:59.102
DIFFERENT. THAT IS PUBLICLY

02:47:59.169 --> 02:47:59.736
AVAILABLE INFORMATION. THAT'S

02:47:59.803 --> 02:48:00.837
ABSOLUTELY NOT WHAT'S COVERED

02:48:00.904 --> 02:48:02.572
UNDER THIS BILL. WHAT IS COVERED

02:48:02.639 --> 02:48:04.274
IS THE MASSIVE AMOUNT OF DATA

02:48:04.340 --> 02:48:05.975
THAT APARTMENT OWNERS ARE

02:48:06.042 --> 02:48:06.943
SHARING THAT IT'S UNCLEAR TO ME

02:48:07.010 --> 02:48:09.846
IF THEY EVEN KNOW THEY DON'T.

02:48:09.913 --> 02:48:10.947
THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION THAT

02:48:11.014 --> 02:48:15.318
THESE ALGORITHMS ARE USING TO

02:48:15.385 --> 02:48:16.686
CONTROL THE MARKET IN WAYS THAT

02:48:16.753 --> 02:48:18.354
THEY DID NOT INTEND. AND SO I

02:48:18.421 --> 02:48:20.723
THINK THAT AS WE LOOK AT DATA

02:48:20.790 --> 02:48:21.891
AND THE POWER OF DATA, THAT'S

02:48:21.958 --> 02:48:22.759
WHAT THIS IS REALLY FOCUSED AT.

02:48:22.826 --> 02:48:24.961
BUT IT IS NOT. TO INTERRUPT A

02:48:25.028 --> 02:48:25.795
FREE MARKET IS TO CREATE A

02:48:25.862 --> 02:48:28.264
HEALTHY, FREE MARKET. THANK YOU.

02:48:28.331 --> 02:48:30.300
THANK YOU FOR THE CONVERSATION

02:48:30.366 --> 02:48:33.336
ON THIS. AND THIS DOES HAPPEN. I

02:48:33.403 --> 02:48:36.506
RECOMMEND AI RECOMMENDATION THAT

02:48:36.573 --> 02:48:39.409
WILL BE GOING ON TO IF IT PASSES

02:48:39.476 --> 02:48:40.009
TO PRIVACY PROTECTION. I THANK

02:48:40.076 --> 02:48:41.377
OUR PRIVACY CHAIR AND THEIR

02:48:41.444 --> 02:48:42.712
STAFF. I THINK THESE ARE THE

02:48:42.779 --> 02:48:45.215
KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE WORK A

02:48:45.281 --> 02:48:46.449
LOT ON, AND INCLUDING TRYING TO

02:48:46.516 --> 02:48:49.152
GET CONSISTENCY WITH NUMEROUS

02:48:49.219 --> 02:48:50.587
BILLS. I WILL NOTE THAT THE

02:48:50.653 --> 02:48:52.422
ASSEMBLYMEMBER AGUILAR, BILL AB

02:48:52.489 --> 02:48:53.890
325 AMENDS THE CARTWRIGHT ACT.

02:48:53.957 --> 02:48:54.757
THESE OTHER THREE BILLS DO NOT.

02:48:54.824 --> 02:48:57.460
AND SO THERE MIGHT BE SOME

02:48:57.527 --> 02:48:58.094
DIFFERENTIATION IN THE LANGUAGE

02:48:58.161 --> 02:48:59.829
AND TERMINOLOGY AND GUARDRAILS

02:48:59.896 --> 02:49:01.698
THAT MAY BE PUT IN PLACE, BUT

02:49:01.764 --> 02:49:03.533
WE'LL DO OUR BEST TO TRY TO

02:49:03.600 --> 02:49:05.635
CREATE CONSISTENCY. WHEN I SAY

02:49:05.702 --> 02:49:07.604
WE I MEAN PRIVACY COMMITTEE,

02:49:07.670 --> 02:49:08.638
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TO CREATE

02:49:08.705 --> 02:49:09.739
CONSISTENCY AMONGST THE THREE

02:49:09.806 --> 02:49:11.140
BILLS. IT JUST TO BE FRANK,

02:49:11.207 --> 02:49:12.675
WOULD BE NICE IF SOME OF THAT

02:49:12.742 --> 02:49:14.744
WORK WAS DONE ON THE SENATE

02:49:14.811 --> 02:49:17.213
SIDE. BUT WE WILL DO WHAT WE

02:49:17.280 --> 02:49:18.648
HAVE TO DO HERE, AS IS OUR DUTY.

02:49:18.715 --> 02:49:21.584
AND SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

THANKING MY SPONSORS ON THIS

BILL, WHO PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN

02:50:45.635 --> 02:50:48.571
DEFEATING THE AMENDMENT IN THE

02:50:48.638 --> 02:50:50.573
BIG, HORRIBLE BILL THAT WOULD

02:50:50.640 --> 02:50:54.944
HAVE ITS GOAL WAS TO GET RID OF

02:50:55.011 --> 02:50:55.979
ALL STATE REGULATION OF AI, AND

02:50:56.045 --> 02:50:58.214
THAT WENT DOWN 99 TO 1. SO

02:50:58.281 --> 02:50:59.949
CONGRATULATIONS TO MY SPONSORS

02:51:00.016 --> 02:51:02.852

02:51:02.919 --> 02:51:04.287
COLLEAGUES, LAST YEAR, AS YOU'LL

02:51:04.354 --> 02:51:06.122
RECALL, BECAUSE IT CAME TO THIS

02:51:06.189 --> 02:51:09.525
COMMITTEE, WE AUTHORED SENATE

02:51:09.592 --> 02:51:15.465
BILL 1047. AND THAT BILL WAS

02:51:15.531 --> 02:51:17.333
VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR. AND

02:51:17.400 --> 02:51:20.036
THERE WERE TWO PIECES OF THAT

02:51:20.103 --> 02:51:23.272
BILL ABOUT PROTECTING

02:51:23.339 --> 02:51:25.675
WHISTLEBLOWERS WHO WERE SOUNDING

02:51:25.742 --> 02:51:28.745
THE ALARM ON CATASTROPHIC RISK,

02:51:28.811 --> 02:51:31.681
AS WELL AS THE CREATION OF CAL

02:51:31.748 --> 02:51:33.349
COMPUTE, A PUBLIC CLOUD TO TRY

02:51:33.416 --> 02:51:34.917
TO DEMOCRATIZE ACCESS, TO

02:51:34.984 --> 02:51:36.753
COMPUTE IN TERMS OF THE

02:51:36.819 --> 02:51:37.687
INNOVATION THAT'S HAPPENING IN

02:51:37.754 --> 02:51:40.657
CALIFORNIA, THOSE TWO PIECES

02:51:40.723 --> 02:51:43.426
WERE NOT AT THE CENTER OF THE

02:51:43.493 --> 02:51:45.328
CONTROVERSY AND ARE GOOD, SOLID

02:51:45.395 --> 02:51:48.464
POLICIES. SO WE INTRODUCED SB 53

02:51:48.531 --> 02:51:52.835
WITH THOSE TWO PIECES. WE OUR

02:51:52.902 --> 02:51:54.804
GOAL IS TO TRY TO MAKE SURE

02:51:54.871 --> 02:51:57.273
THAT, YOU KNOW, WE KNOW THAT AI

02:51:57.340 --> 02:51:58.641
IS INCREDIBLY POWERFUL

02:51:58.708 --> 02:52:00.376
TECHNOLOGY. IT'S ADVANCING

02:52:00.443 --> 02:52:02.178
RAPIDLY. IT HAS SO MUCH PROMISE

02:52:02.245 --> 02:52:03.746
TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE

02:52:03.813 --> 02:52:04.914
AND TO IMPROVE PEOPLE'S HEALTH

02:52:04.981 --> 02:52:07.316
AND QUALITY OF LIFE. BUT AS WITH

02:52:07.383 --> 02:52:09.118
ANY POWERFUL TECHNOLOGY, THERE

02:52:09.185 --> 02:52:11.654
ARE RISKS, AND WE WANT TO GET

02:52:11.721 --> 02:52:13.556
AHEAD OF THOSE RISKS. AND WE

02:52:13.623 --> 02:52:15.391
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF FOLKS

02:52:15.458 --> 02:52:17.326
SEE RISK EMERGING, THAT'S NOT

02:52:17.393 --> 02:52:19.095
BEING ADDRESSED PROPERLY, THAT

02:52:19.162 --> 02:52:20.997
THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO SAY

02:52:21.064 --> 02:52:22.899
SOMETHING. WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE

02:52:22.965 --> 02:52:25.601
SURE THAT THAT COMPUTE IS NOT

02:52:25.668 --> 02:52:27.503
BEING MONOPOLIZED BY LARGE

02:52:27.570 --> 02:52:30.006
PLAYERS, AND THAT PEOPLE, SMALL,

02:52:30.073 --> 02:52:31.040
SMALL PLAYERS WHO ARE

02:52:31.107 --> 02:52:33.176
INNOVATING, ACADEMICS, ETC, ARE

02:52:33.242 --> 02:52:35.645
ABLE TO ACCESS IT. I DO JUST

02:52:35.712 --> 02:52:38.181
WANT TO NOTE THAT WHEN THE

02:52:38.247 --> 02:52:40.483
GOVERNOR VETOED SB 1047, HE

02:52:40.550 --> 02:52:42.985
CONVENED A WORKING GROUP. THAT

02:52:43.052 --> 02:52:45.455
WORKING GROUP RELEASED ITS

02:52:45.521 --> 02:52:47.957
REPORT SEVERAL WEEKS AGO. WHEN I

02:52:48.024 --> 02:52:50.059
INTRODUCED SB 53, I INDICATED MY

02:52:50.126 --> 02:52:52.195
OPENNESS TO INCLUDING ELEMENTS

02:52:52.261 --> 02:52:53.296
OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS

02:52:53.362 --> 02:52:54.864
DEPENDING ON WHAT THEY WERE. WE

02:52:54.931 --> 02:52:57.667
THINK THERE ARE SOME VERY SOLID

02:52:57.734 --> 02:52:58.835
RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE BILL, AND

02:52:58.901 --> 02:53:02.438
WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH

02:53:02.505 --> 02:53:04.240
PRIVACY COMMITTEE AND ITS CHAIR,

02:53:04.307 --> 02:53:07.877

COURSE, WORK WITH JUDICIARY

02:53:12.815 --> 02:53:14.050
COMMITTEE AS WELL. AND SO WITH

02:53:14.117 --> 02:53:15.785
THAT, I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN

02:53:15.852 --> 02:53:17.987

GREAT. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING,

02:53:30.500 --> 02:53:31.567
CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE

02:53:31.634 --> 02:53:32.969
COMMITTEE. I'M TERRY LEE, THE

02:53:33.035 --> 02:53:34.337
DIRECTOR OF ECONOMIC SECURITY,

02:53:34.403 --> 02:53:35.872
CALIFORNIA AND A PROUD

02:53:35.938 --> 02:53:37.707
CO-SPONSOR OF SB 53. I WANT TO

02:53:37.774 --> 02:53:38.741
THANK THE SENATOR FOR HIS

02:53:38.808 --> 02:53:40.209
CONTINUED LEADERSHIP ON THIS

02:53:40.276 --> 02:53:40.977
IMPORTANT ISSUE. I'M GOING TO

02:53:41.043 --> 02:53:42.712
TALK A BIT ABOUT CAL COMPUTE,

02:53:42.779 --> 02:53:43.713
WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH A

02:53:43.780 --> 02:53:45.448
CONSORTIUM TO DEVELOP A PUBLICLY

02:53:45.515 --> 02:53:46.616
OWNED AND OPERATED CLOUD

02:53:46.682 --> 02:53:49.152
COMPUTING CLUSTER TO EXPAND AND

02:53:49.218 --> 02:53:50.520
DEMOCRATIZE ACCESS TO CRITICAL

02:53:50.586 --> 02:53:52.855
AI INFRASTRUCTURE. FIRST, CLOUD

02:53:52.922 --> 02:53:54.357
COMPUTE ADDRESSES THE PROBLEM OF

02:53:54.423 --> 02:53:55.992
EXTREME CONCENTRATION OF COMPUTE

02:53:56.058 --> 02:53:57.927
POWER IN FEW HANDS. COMPUTE IS

02:53:57.994 --> 02:53:59.695
THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IN

02:53:59.762 --> 02:54:01.864
ENABLING OR LIMITING AI

02:54:01.931 --> 02:54:03.199
INNOVATION. IT'S EXTREMELY

02:54:03.266 --> 02:54:04.567
EXPENSIVE AND CONTROLLED BY A

02:54:04.634 --> 02:54:06.102
TINY NUMBER OF COMPANIES, WHO

02:54:06.169 --> 02:54:07.470
THEREFORE HAVE AN OUTSIZED SAY

02:54:07.537 --> 02:54:09.272
IN WHAT'S DEVELOPED AND WHOM IT

02:54:09.338 --> 02:54:10.807
BENEFITS. MEANWHILE, STARTUPS

02:54:10.873 --> 02:54:12.575
AND EVEN MAJOR ACADEMIC

02:54:12.642 --> 02:54:14.043
INSTITUTIONS LAG BEHIND. FOR

02:54:14.110 --> 02:54:15.778
EXAMPLE, STANFORD HAS 300

02:54:15.845 --> 02:54:17.180
SPECIALIZED CHIPS NEEDED FOR AI,

02:54:17.246 --> 02:54:19.682
WHILE MICROSOFT HAS 1.8 MILLION.

02:54:19.749 --> 02:54:21.484
THIS DISPARITY AFFECTS CAREER

02:54:21.551 --> 02:54:23.286
PATHWAYS, TOO, WITH CALIFORNIA

02:54:23.352 --> 02:54:24.687
EDUCATED TECH TALENT LURED AWAY

02:54:24.754 --> 02:54:26.522
FROM SOLVING PRESSING PUBLIC

02:54:26.589 --> 02:54:27.657
PROBLEMS. BECAUSE THE PRIVATE

02:54:27.723 --> 02:54:29.659
SECTOR IS JUST MUCH MORE

02:54:29.725 --> 02:54:31.327
DYNAMIC. SECOND, CAL COMPUTE

02:54:31.394 --> 02:54:33.129
CONTINUES CALIFORNIA'S LEGACY OF

02:54:33.196 --> 02:54:33.830
TRANSFORMATIVE PUBLIC

02:54:33.896 --> 02:54:35.231
INVESTMENTS IN CUTTING EDGE

02:54:35.298 --> 02:54:36.666
RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS

02:54:36.732 --> 02:54:38.201
OUR PIONEERING STEM CELL

02:54:38.267 --> 02:54:39.535
RESEARCH CENTER AND OUR WORLD

02:54:39.602 --> 02:54:41.437
CLASS NATIONAL LABS. WE ARE THE

02:54:41.504 --> 02:54:43.105
HOME OF AI AND SHOULD BE LEADING

02:54:43.172 --> 02:54:44.807
ON THIS TO NEW YORK IS ALREADY

02:54:44.874 --> 02:54:46.509
SHOWING WHAT'S POSSIBLE AFTER

02:54:46.576 --> 02:54:47.977
INVESTING IN A CONSORTIUM LAST

02:54:48.044 --> 02:54:49.812
YEAR. EMPIRE AI HAS 200 PLUS

02:54:49.879 --> 02:54:50.980
RESEARCHERS. THEY ARE BUSY

02:54:51.047 --> 02:54:52.849
BUILDING CLIMATE MODELS AND

02:54:52.915 --> 02:54:55.017
IMPROVING CANCER DIAGNOSIS.

02:54:55.084 --> 02:54:56.485
CALIFORNIA SHOULD JOIN THEM AND

02:54:56.552 --> 02:54:58.354
SHOW THE WORLD HOW TO SPUR

02:54:58.421 --> 02:54:59.655
INNOVATION IN A CLIMATE OF

02:54:59.722 --> 02:55:00.489
TRANSPARENCY AND SAFETY.

02:55:00.556 --> 02:55:01.691
FINALLY, CAL COMPUTE IS POPULAR.

02:55:01.757 --> 02:55:02.959
AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED, IT

02:55:03.025 --> 02:55:04.026
RECEIVED NEARLY UNIVERSAL

02:55:04.093 --> 02:55:05.261
SUPPORT AS PART OF LAST YEAR'S

02:55:05.328 --> 02:55:07.663
SB 1047, AND SINCE THEN IT WAS

02:55:07.730 --> 02:55:09.365
NAMED AS THE TOP RECOMMENDATION

02:55:09.432 --> 02:55:10.366
IN THE LITTLE HOOVER

02:55:10.433 --> 02:55:11.601
COMMISSION'S REPORT ON AI, WHICH

02:55:11.667 --> 02:55:13.436
CITED REASONS SIMILAR TO THOSE I

02:55:13.502 --> 02:55:14.470
OFFERED ABOVE, AMONG OTHERS,

02:55:14.537 --> 02:55:15.571
INCLUDING RECOGNIZING THE

02:55:15.638 --> 02:55:17.640
BENEFIT OF THE STATE OF

02:55:17.707 --> 02:55:18.741
CALIFORNIA ACHIEVING A DEGREE OF

02:55:18.808 --> 02:55:19.842
TECHNOLOGICAL INDEPENDENCE,

02:55:19.909 --> 02:55:21.110
WHICH RIGHT NOW SEEMS MORE

02:55:21.177 --> 02:55:22.478
IMPORTANT THAN EVER. FOR ALL OF

02:55:22.545 --> 02:55:24.714
THESE REASONS, I URGE YOUR AYE

02:55:24.780 --> 02:55:27.083

ADVOCATING FOR SAFE AND

02:55:42.832 --> 02:55:45.101
RESPONSIBLE AI DEVELOPMENT. I'M

02:55:45.167 --> 02:55:46.936
HERE TO TESTIFY TODAY IN STRONG

02:55:47.003 --> 02:55:49.205
SUPPORT OF SB 53. IN PARTICULAR,

02:55:49.272 --> 02:55:50.806
I WANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT THE

WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS IN

02:55:52.108 --> 02:55:53.509
THIS BILL ARE CRITICALLY

02:55:53.576 --> 02:55:54.644
IMPORTANT. MAKE AN IMPORTANT

02:55:54.710 --> 02:55:56.679
ADDITION TO EXISTING LAW, AND

02:55:56.746 --> 02:55:58.814
ARE CAREFULLY TARGETED. FIRST,

02:55:58.881 --> 02:55:59.749
AS I SAID, THE BILL IS

02:55:59.815 --> 02:56:00.816
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. EARLIER

02:56:00.883 --> 02:56:02.752
THIS MONTH, A PANEL OF EXPERTS

02:56:02.818 --> 02:56:04.120
CONVENED CONVENED BY GOVERNOR

02:56:04.186 --> 02:56:05.421
NEWSOM RELEASED THE CALIFORNIA

02:56:05.488 --> 02:56:07.323
REPORT ON FRONTIER AI POLICY.

02:56:07.390 --> 02:56:10.226
THE REPORT STATED THAT EVIDENCE

02:56:10.293 --> 02:56:11.661
OF SOME SEVERE RISKS FROM

02:56:11.727 --> 02:56:13.029
ADVANCED AI SYSTEMS WERE

02:56:13.095 --> 02:56:14.797
UNCLEAR, BUT GROWING, INCLUDING

02:56:14.864 --> 02:56:16.399
AI, ENABLED HACKING OR

02:56:16.465 --> 02:56:17.833
BIOLOGICAL ATTACKS AND LOSS OF

02:56:17.900 --> 02:56:20.336
CONTROL OF AI SYSTEMS. IN AREAS

02:56:20.403 --> 02:56:21.470
WHERE EVIDENCE IS STILL

02:56:21.537 --> 02:56:22.505
EMERGING, IT IS EMPLOYEES AT

02:56:22.571 --> 02:56:24.040
MAJOR AI COMPANIES WHO ARE

02:56:24.106 --> 02:56:25.808
LIKELY TO BE THE FIRST TO

02:56:25.875 --> 02:56:27.276
IDENTIFY POTENTIAL RISKS. IN

02:56:27.343 --> 02:56:28.210
LINE WITH ONE OF THE

02:56:28.277 --> 02:56:29.345
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE REPORT,

02:56:29.412 --> 02:56:31.080
SB 53 WOULD ENSURE THAT WHEN

02:56:31.147 --> 02:56:32.348
THESE EMPLOYEES COME FORWARD,

02:56:32.415 --> 02:56:33.649
THEY ARE PROTECTED FROM

02:56:33.716 --> 02:56:35.117
RETALIATION. THIS CRUCIAL

02:56:35.184 --> 02:56:36.252
MEASURE WILL HELP KEEP

02:56:36.319 --> 02:56:38.287
CALIFORNIANS SAFE. SECOND, THE

02:56:38.354 --> 02:56:39.922
BILL MAKES AN IMPORTANT ADDITION

02:56:39.989 --> 02:56:41.657
TO EXISTING LAW. EXISTING

02:56:41.724 --> 02:56:42.758
CALIFORNIA LAW ALREADY AFFORDS

02:56:42.825 --> 02:56:44.293
THE SAME REMEDIES FOUND IN THIS

02:56:44.360 --> 02:56:45.861
BILL TO EMPLOYEES WHO REPORT

02:56:45.928 --> 02:56:47.330
VIOLATIONS OF THE LAW. BUT

02:56:47.396 --> 02:56:49.231
BECAUSE RISK ADVANCED AI ARE SO

02:56:49.298 --> 02:56:50.833
NEW, THERE ARE FEW REGULATIONS

02:56:50.900 --> 02:56:53.402
WHERE VIOLATION WOULD GIVE RISE

02:56:53.469 --> 02:56:56.005
TO REPORTING. SB 53 EXTENDS

02:56:56.072 --> 02:56:57.239
PROTECTIONS TO EMPLOYEES WHO

02:56:57.306 --> 02:56:58.474
REPORT FORESEEABLE AND MATERIAL

02:56:58.541 --> 02:57:00.376
RISKS OF EXTREME HARM TO PUBLIC

02:57:00.443 --> 02:57:01.911
SAFETY OR PROPERTY, AS WELL AS

02:57:01.978 --> 02:57:03.346
THOSE WHO REPORT FALSE

02:57:03.412 --> 02:57:04.480
STATEMENTS FROM THEIR EMPLOYERS

02:57:04.547 --> 02:57:06.482
ABOUT THOSE RISKS. THIS IS A

02:57:06.549 --> 02:57:07.216
COMMONSENSE APPROACH FOR

02:57:07.283 --> 02:57:09.652
EMERGING RISKS. LAST, THE BILL

02:57:09.719 --> 02:57:11.053
IS CAREFULLY TARGETED. IT

02:57:11.120 --> 02:57:12.688
APPLIES ONLY TO EMPLOYEES AT

02:57:12.755 --> 02:57:13.556
VERY LARGE COMPANIES DEVELOPING

02:57:13.622 --> 02:57:15.124
THE MOST ADVANCED AI SYSTEMS

02:57:15.191 --> 02:57:16.926
ONLY TO RISKS OF EXTREMELY

02:57:16.993 --> 02:57:17.760
SEVERE HARM, AND ONLY WHEN

02:57:17.827 --> 02:57:19.428
EMPLOYEES REPORT RISKS TO OTHER

02:57:19.495 --> 02:57:20.930
RESPONSIBLE EMPLOYEES, FEDERAL

02:57:20.997 --> 02:57:22.031
AUTHORITIES, OR THE ATTORNEY

02:57:22.098 --> 02:57:24.066
GENERAL. SB 53 IS AN IMPORTANT

02:57:24.133 --> 02:57:25.501
STEP FORWARD TOWARDS UNCOVERING

02:57:25.568 --> 02:57:26.669
POTENTIALLY CATASTROPHIC RISKS

02:57:26.736 --> 02:57:28.471
TO PUBLIC SAFETY. IT IS TARGETED

02:57:28.537 --> 02:57:29.739
AND COMMON SENSE, AND THAT'S WHY

02:57:29.805 --> 02:57:31.007
THE SENATE UNANIMOUSLY ADVANCED

02:57:31.073 --> 02:57:33.009
IT. I URGE YOU TO VOTE YES.

LIKE IT. I WANT IT HAS A SUNSET

02:58:34.670 --> 02:58:36.472
DATE JANUARY 1ST, 2027. DO I

02:58:36.539 --> 02:58:40.042
READ THAT CORRECTLY? SO YOU'RE

02:58:40.109 --> 02:58:41.811
GOING TO GET ALL THIS KNOWLEDGE

02:58:41.877 --> 02:58:43.979
AND REVIEW AND ASSESSMENT AND

02:58:44.046 --> 02:58:45.214
THEN IT DOESN'T CONTINUE AFTER

02:58:45.281 --> 02:58:48.350
THAT DATE. IT SAYS IS

02:58:48.417 --> 02:58:49.718
ESTABLISHED. THIS SHALL BE THIS

02:58:49.785 --> 02:58:51.720
SECTION SHALL BECOME OPERATIVE

02:58:51.787 --> 02:58:55.257
ONLY UPON THE BUDGET ACT THAT

02:58:55.324 --> 02:58:56.759
THAT'S DISSOLVED UPON SUBMISSION

02:58:56.826 --> 02:58:58.727
OF THE REPORT. THAT'S JUST THE

02:58:58.794 --> 02:59:00.963
CONSORTIUM FOR CAL COMPUTE.

02:59:01.030 --> 02:59:01.864
THERE'S THE REST OF THE BILL

02:59:01.931 --> 02:59:04.100
WILL BE CAL COMPUTE WILL STILL

02:59:04.166 --> 02:59:06.302
EXIST, AND THE WHISTLEBLOWER

02:59:06.368 --> 02:59:07.103
PROTECTIONS WILL STILL EXIST.

02:59:07.169 --> 02:59:08.471
THAT'S ONE SMALL PIECE OF THE

02:59:08.537 --> 02:59:10.573
BILL. OKAY. SO BACK TO THE

02:59:10.639 --> 02:59:12.808
LARGER PURPOSE. AND THE

02:59:12.875 --> 02:59:14.243
WHISTLEBLOWER IS REALLY

02:59:14.310 --> 02:59:16.712
IMPORTANT. I WANT TO HEAR A

02:59:16.779 --> 02:59:17.546
LITTLE BIT MORE WHY. AND I DON'T

02:59:17.613 --> 02:59:18.781
DISAGREE. I JUST WANT YOU'RE

02:59:18.848 --> 02:59:21.150
TRYING TO GET AT. BUT DOES THIS

02:59:21.217 --> 02:59:22.718
HAVING SERVED ON AND CONTINUE TO

02:59:22.785 --> 02:59:23.986
SERVE ON THE PRIVACY COMMITTEE.

02:59:24.053 --> 02:59:26.388
AND SO WE'RE ALL SENSITIVE ABOUT

02:59:26.455 --> 02:59:28.757
PRIVACY AND I AND HOW WE'VE BEEN

02:59:28.824 --> 02:59:30.126
TRYING THROUGH SEVERAL YEARS

02:59:30.192 --> 02:59:31.861
NOW, TRYING TO GET OUR ARMS

02:59:31.927 --> 02:59:33.496
AROUND AI SO AS NOT TO STIFLE

02:59:33.562 --> 02:59:36.198
IT, BUT TO PROTECT EVERYONE. SO

02:59:36.265 --> 02:59:38.334
IS THAT IS THIS GOING TO BE THE

02:59:38.400 --> 02:59:41.570
CENTER OF DETERMINING WHETHER AI

02:59:41.637 --> 02:59:44.073
IS GOOD FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND

02:59:44.140 --> 02:59:46.775
GOOD FOR THE STATE, OR

02:59:46.842 --> 02:59:48.310
DEPOSITING THIS KIND OF

02:59:48.377 --> 02:59:50.312
AUTHORITY AND REVIEW? AND YEAH,

02:59:50.379 --> 02:59:51.647
IF I'M PUTTING WORDS IN YOUR

02:59:51.714 --> 02:59:52.848
MOUTH, I'M JUST TRYING TO

02:59:52.915 --> 02:59:53.883
UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT THIS WILL

02:59:53.949 --> 02:59:55.718
DO. YEAH. SO THE WHISTLEBLOWER

02:59:55.784 --> 02:59:57.286
PROTECTION IS ONE PIECE. RIGHT.

02:59:57.353 --> 02:59:59.922
AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING TO WE

02:59:59.989 --> 03:00:01.790
TRIED LAST YEAR WITH SB 1047 TO

03:00:01.857 --> 03:00:03.692
PUT SOME BASIC SAFETY STANDARDS

03:00:03.759 --> 03:00:05.394
IN PLACE. I'M GRATEFUL THAT WE

03:00:05.461 --> 03:00:07.530
GOT BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THE

03:00:07.596 --> 03:00:09.165
LEGISLATURE. THE GOVERNOR DID

03:00:09.231 --> 03:00:11.867
VETO IT, BUT PROVIDED A PATH FOR

03:00:11.934 --> 03:00:13.002
ADDITIONAL WORK, WHICH I

03:00:13.068 --> 03:00:16.572
APPRECIATE. AND SO ULTIMATELY

03:00:16.639 --> 03:00:18.707
WE'RE THAT WORK IS ONGOING. AND

03:00:18.774 --> 03:00:20.476
I MENTIONED THE REPORT THAT JUST

03:00:20.543 --> 03:00:22.411
CAME OUT AND THE WORK THAT WE

03:00:22.478 --> 03:00:24.446
ARE POTENTIALLY GOING TO DO IN

03:00:24.513 --> 03:00:26.949
PRIVACY COMMITTEE ON IT. BUT

03:00:27.016 --> 03:00:28.884
RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE THERE REALLY

03:00:28.951 --> 03:00:32.188
IS A LACK OF SAFETY REGULATION

03:00:32.254 --> 03:00:35.257
OR TRANSPARENCY, WE WANT TO MAKE

03:00:35.324 --> 03:00:37.560
SURE THAT, YOU KNOW, THERE THERE

03:00:37.626 --> 03:00:40.062
WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE AI LABS

03:00:40.129 --> 03:00:42.398
THAT TAKE SAFETY VERY SERIOUSLY.

03:00:42.464 --> 03:00:43.866
OTHERS MAY BE A LITTLE BIT LESS.

03:00:43.933 --> 03:00:45.701
SO THERE'S A SPECTRUM AND WE

03:00:45.768 --> 03:00:47.937
DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING. AND

03:00:48.003 --> 03:00:49.672
SO THE PEOPLE WHO DO KNOW ARE

03:00:49.738 --> 03:00:51.106
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING

03:00:51.173 --> 03:00:52.875
INSIDE THOSE LABS. AND JUST LIKE

03:00:52.942 --> 03:00:55.344
WE SAID TO THE PUBLIC

03:00:55.411 --> 03:00:56.879
INFORMATION CAMPAIGN FOR KIDS,

03:00:56.946 --> 03:00:59.448
SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING. IF

03:00:59.515 --> 03:01:01.217
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO IDENTIFY

03:01:01.283 --> 03:01:02.685
SOMETHING HAPPENING IN THAT LAB,

03:01:02.751 --> 03:01:04.220
THAT THERE IS A RISK EMERGING

03:01:04.286 --> 03:01:06.055
WITH ONE OF THE MODELS THAT

03:01:06.121 --> 03:01:07.723
COULD LEAD TO CATASTROPHIC HARM,

03:01:07.790 --> 03:01:09.225
THAT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO COME

03:01:09.291 --> 03:01:10.559
FORWARD AND SAY SOMETHING

03:01:10.626 --> 03:01:12.294
WITHOUT BEING BANNED BY THEIR

03:01:12.361 --> 03:01:13.829
EMPLOYER FROM DOING THAT, OR

03:01:13.896 --> 03:01:16.065
WITHOUT BEING PUNISHED FOR DOING

03:01:16.131 --> 03:01:18.000
IT. WE WANT GOING TO THE

03:01:18.067 --> 03:01:19.468
LABORATORY LIKE THE FOUNDATIONAL

03:01:19.535 --> 03:01:21.103
WHERE ALL THIS IS BEING CREATED,

03:01:21.170 --> 03:01:22.871
NOT NECESSARILY THE APPLICATION.

03:01:22.938 --> 03:01:24.440
RIGHT. THIS IS AT THE FOUNDATION

03:01:24.506 --> 03:01:26.342
MODEL LEVEL. YEAH. ALL RIGHT.

03:01:26.408 --> 03:01:28.978
VERY GOOD. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT.

03:01:29.044 --> 03:01:30.646
ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S BAUER-KAHAN.

03:01:30.713 --> 03:01:31.880
WELL, I WANT TO START BY

03:01:31.947 --> 03:01:34.283
THANKING THE AUTHOR FOR HIS

03:01:34.350 --> 03:01:35.084
CONTINUED WORK ON THIS AND HIS

03:01:35.150 --> 03:01:36.919
GREAT WORK IN COLLABORATION AND

03:01:36.986 --> 03:01:37.987
COMMUNICATION WITH BOTH. I KNOW

03:01:38.053 --> 03:01:39.688
THIS COMMITTEE AND THE PRIVACY

03:01:39.755 --> 03:01:40.689
COMMITTEE. AS THIS MOVES

03:01:40.756 --> 03:01:43.025
FORWARD, I THINK, YOU KNOW, I

03:01:43.092 --> 03:01:45.761
HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OR CURSE OF

03:01:45.828 --> 03:01:46.962
BEING ASKED. I DON'T KNOW HOW

03:01:47.029 --> 03:01:48.831
MANY TIMES OVER THE LAST YEAR

03:01:48.897 --> 03:01:51.166
WHAT I THOUGHT OF SB 1047. AND I

03:01:51.233 --> 03:01:52.768
OFTEN TALKED ABOUT CAL COMPUTE

03:01:52.835 --> 03:01:54.370
BECAUSE IT WAS THE THING NOBODY

03:01:54.436 --> 03:01:55.671
WAS TALKING ABOUT IN THAT BILL.

03:01:55.738 --> 03:01:58.207
AND YET I THINK IT IS TRULY ONE

03:01:58.274 --> 03:01:59.108
OF THE MOST CRITICAL PIECES OF

03:01:59.174 --> 03:02:01.510
THE WORK YOU'VE DONE. BECAUSE

03:02:01.577 --> 03:02:02.711
COMPETITION, AS WE SAID IN THE

03:02:02.778 --> 03:02:04.213
LAST BILL, IS EVERYTHING. AND

03:02:04.280 --> 03:02:06.749
RIGHT NOW COMPUTE IS SO

03:02:06.815 --> 03:02:08.417
EXPENSIVE. IT IS IN THE HANDS OF

03:02:08.484 --> 03:02:09.952
VERY, VERY FEW PLAYERS. AND

03:02:10.019 --> 03:02:12.187
THAT, I THINK, SETS US UP FOR AN

03:02:12.254 --> 03:02:13.455
INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS DYNAMIC.

03:02:13.522 --> 03:02:15.224
AND BY CREATING THIS OPPORTUNITY

03:02:15.291 --> 03:02:16.859
FOR MORE PEOPLE TO HAVE ACCESS

03:02:16.925 --> 03:02:18.360
TO THE SAME COMPUTE, WE REALLY

03:02:18.427 --> 03:02:19.595
CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE I

03:02:19.662 --> 03:02:21.096
THINK GOOD CAN HAPPEN. THERE CAN

03:02:21.163 --> 03:02:23.365
BE A BETTER, SAFER OPTIONS IN

03:02:23.432 --> 03:02:25.234
THE MARKET. AND I THINK THAT'S

03:02:25.301 --> 03:02:25.901
INCREDIBLE THAT YOU CONTINUE TO

03:02:25.968 --> 03:02:27.736
WORK ON THAT. OBVIOUSLY, COST IS

03:02:27.803 --> 03:02:29.071
AN ISSUE, SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN

03:02:29.138 --> 03:02:31.607
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO DO THAT WITH

03:02:31.674 --> 03:02:32.207
PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS OR

03:02:32.274 --> 03:02:33.976
WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE. BUT I

03:02:34.043 --> 03:02:34.777
THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT, AND

03:02:34.843 --> 03:02:36.512
I WANT TO APPLAUD YOU FOR

03:02:36.578 --> 03:02:38.113
KEEPING THAT UP ON THE

03:02:38.180 --> 03:02:38.714
WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS. I

03:02:38.781 --> 03:02:41.617
THINK THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT

03:02:41.684 --> 03:02:43.585
BECAUSE PART OF WHAT THE CURRENT

03:02:43.652 --> 03:02:45.387
LAW SAYS ABOUT WHISTLEBLOWER

03:02:45.454 --> 03:02:46.822
PROTECTIONS IS THAT IF THERE IS

03:02:46.889 --> 03:02:47.823
A VIOLATION OF THE LAW, THEN YOU

03:02:47.890 --> 03:02:49.858
CAN WHISTLEBLOW, BUT WE HAVE TO

03:02:49.925 --> 03:02:52.361
WAIT UNTIL THAT THING HAPPENS.

03:02:52.428 --> 03:02:52.928
AND I THINK WHAT YOU HAVE

03:02:52.995 --> 03:02:53.962
IDENTIFIED HERE IS THAT WE WANT

03:02:54.029 --> 03:02:55.864
TO KNOW BEFORE, IF THEY KNOW

03:02:55.931 --> 03:02:57.566
THROUGH THEIR OWN TESTING AND

03:02:57.633 --> 03:02:58.701
THEIR OWN MODELING, THAT THERE

03:02:58.767 --> 03:03:00.969
IS A RISK OF A BIOLOGICAL

03:03:01.036 --> 03:03:01.904
WEAPON, THAT WE SHOULD KNOW THAT

03:03:01.970 --> 03:03:03.839
SO WE CAN START TO MITIGATE IT

03:03:03.906 --> 03:03:05.741
AND THE WORLD CAN START TO

03:03:05.808 --> 03:03:07.710
PREPARE FOR IT. I WILL NOTE

03:03:07.776 --> 03:03:09.845
THAT, YOU KNOW, THE COMMITTEE

03:03:09.912 --> 03:03:10.979
ANALYSIS GOES INTO WHY MAYBE YOU

03:03:11.046 --> 03:03:13.282
NEED TO BROADEN THE DEFINITIONS

03:03:13.349 --> 03:03:14.917
OF WHISTLEBLOWING. AND I THINK

03:03:14.983 --> 03:03:18.721
THAT WAS, YOU KNOW, IS I GUESS

03:03:18.787 --> 03:03:20.923
WE ARE BOTH JEWISH AND WE

03:03:20.989 --> 03:03:22.758
BELIEVE THAT EVERY LIFE IS

03:03:22.825 --> 03:03:23.726
SACRED. AND SO DO YOU HAVE TO

03:03:23.792 --> 03:03:25.761
KILL 100 PEOPLE LIKE THAT? SEEMS

03:03:25.828 --> 03:03:27.496
A LITTLE I DON'T KNOW. WHERE'D

03:03:27.563 --> 03:03:29.732
YOU GET 100? THAT SEEMS LIKE A

03:03:29.798 --> 03:03:30.366
LOT. SO MAYBE THAT'S A

03:03:30.432 --> 03:03:31.934
CONVERSATION WE CAN CONTINUE.

03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:32.735
BUT I THINK THE FUNDAMENTAL

03:03:32.801 --> 03:03:34.636
PREMISE OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

03:03:34.703 --> 03:03:36.772
DO HERE REALLY WILL MOVE US IN A

03:03:36.839 --> 03:03:37.940
SAFER DIRECTION. I KNOW YOU'RE

03:03:38.006 --> 03:03:38.707
GOING TO CONTINUE TO FIGURE OUT

03:03:38.774 --> 03:03:40.909
IF THERE'S MORE WE CAN DO TO

03:03:40.976 --> 03:03:41.944
KEEP PEOPLE SAFE FROM THESE

03:03:42.010 --> 03:03:44.279
MODELS, BUT AS WE HAD A HEARING

03:03:44.346 --> 03:03:47.216
IN PRIVACY COMMITTEE RECENTLY ON

03:03:47.282 --> 03:03:49.218
CATASTROPHIC RISKS. AND THESE

03:03:49.284 --> 03:03:51.086
MODELS ARE GETTING VERY SMART

03:03:51.153 --> 03:03:54.757
AND THEY ARE OUTSMARTING THE

03:03:54.823 --> 03:03:56.125
DEVELOPERS. AN EXAMPLE WAS GIVEN

03:03:56.191 --> 03:03:58.527
OF A DEVELOPER THAT THE MODEL

03:03:58.594 --> 03:04:00.929
HAD GONE INTO THE EMAIL AND WAS

03:04:00.996 --> 03:04:02.631
NOW BLACKMAILING THE DEVELOPER

03:04:02.698 --> 03:04:03.732
IN ORDER TO NOT GET THE

03:04:03.799 --> 03:04:06.201
DEVELOPER TO SUNSET THE MODEL.

03:04:06.268 --> 03:04:08.837
YOU KNOW, THESE ARE REAL THINGS

03:04:08.904 --> 03:04:10.272
THAT ARE HAPPENING AND ARE BEING

03:04:10.339 --> 03:04:12.040
SEEN AGAIN IN TESTING. AND SO

03:04:12.107 --> 03:04:13.175
IT'S SO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT

03:04:13.242 --> 03:04:14.710
THAT IT CAN COME OUT INTO LIGHT

03:04:14.777 --> 03:04:16.178
EVEN BEFORE WE SEE SUCH

03:04:16.245 --> 03:04:17.579
CATASTROPHIC HARM. SO HAPPY TO

03:04:17.646 --> 03:04:18.747
SUPPORT IT TODAY. GLAD TO HEAR

03:04:18.814 --> 03:04:20.916
IT'S GOING TO HAVE BIPARTISAN

03:04:20.983 --> 03:04:21.850
SUPPORT AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN

03:04:21.917 --> 03:04:23.485
CONTINUE THAT. AND WITH THAT, I

03:04:23.552 --> 03:04:24.586
THINK THERE IS A MOTION, A

03:04:24.653 --> 03:04:26.422
BIPARTISAN MOTION ON THE FLOOR.

03:04:26.488 --> 03:04:30.259
AND. AND I WANT TO THANK THE

03:04:30.325 --> 03:04:31.860
SENATOR FOR HIS EXTRAORDINARY

03:04:31.927 --> 03:04:33.295
WORK IN THIS SPACE, CONTINUED

03:04:33.362 --> 03:04:34.696
WORK IN THIS SPACE. AND I

03:04:34.763 --> 03:04:36.498
APPRECIATE WORKING WITH THE

03:04:36.565 --> 03:04:38.367
ADMINISTRATION ON SOME OF THE

03:04:38.434 --> 03:04:39.568
RECOMMENDATIONS. I THINK THAT'S

03:04:39.635 --> 03:04:41.637
JUST GOING TO MAKE IT THAT MUCH

03:04:41.703 --> 03:04:44.039
STRONGER AS IT MOVES FORWARD AND

03:04:44.106 --> 03:04:44.940
HOPEFULLY SIGNED AT SOME POINT.

03:04:45.007 --> 03:04:48.877
BUT BUT ALSO, I APPRECIATE OUR

03:04:48.944 --> 03:04:51.780
PRIVACY CHAIR FOR NOTING SOME OF

03:04:51.847 --> 03:04:53.449
THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WERE

03:04:53.515 --> 03:04:55.317
NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS. AND SINCE

03:04:55.384 --> 03:04:57.853
THIS IS A IT PASSES, IF THIS

03:04:57.920 --> 03:04:58.620
PASSES WILL BE GOING ON TO

03:04:58.687 --> 03:05:00.622
PRIVACY, I'M SURE THE CHAIR AND

03:05:00.689 --> 03:05:01.757
HER STAFF WILL CONTINUE TO WORK

03:05:01.824 --> 03:05:03.859
WITH YOU ON SOME OF THE ISSUES

03:05:03.926 --> 03:05:04.927
REGARDING THE WHISTLEBLOWERS,

03:05:04.993 --> 03:05:07.396
WHICH I AGREE, CAN, CAN, CAN BE

03:05:07.463 --> 03:05:08.564
WE CAN ADD SOME FINE TUNING

03:05:08.630 --> 03:05:10.132
THERE WITH THAT. WOULD YOU LIKE

03:05:10.199 --> 03:05:11.567
TO CLOSE? I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR

03:05:11.633 --> 03:05:13.569
A VOTE. THANK YOU. MOTIONS DO

03:05:13.635 --> 03:05:15.571
PASS TO PRIVACY AND CONSUMER

03:05:15.637 --> 03:05:18.574
PROTECTION COMMITTEE. I. DIXON

03:05:18.640 --> 03:05:20.976

RIGHT. THE BILL IS OUT. THANK

YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YEAH.

03:05:38.427 --> 03:05:41.330
OUR FIRST BILL OUT TODAY. AND,

03:05:41.396 --> 03:05:45.167
SENATOR WIENER, YOU HAVE.

03:05:45.234 --> 03:05:46.335
SENATOR WIENER, YOU HAVE ITEM 19

03:05:46.401 --> 03:05:49.705
SCR ONE. UNLESS UNLESS YOU WANT

03:05:49.771 --> 03:05:52.774
TO COME BACK LATER FOR THAT ONE.

03:05:52.841 --> 03:05:57.045
THANK YOU. YEAH. I'M GOING TO

03:05:57.112 --> 03:06:04.620
QUIT WHILE I WAS AHEAD. YEAH.

03:06:04.686 --> 03:06:05.821
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY, SENATOR,

03:06:05.888 --> 03:06:06.755
THIS IS ANOTHER ONE THAT'S

03:06:06.822 --> 03:06:09.691
GOTTEN BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. SO.

03:06:09.758 --> 03:06:11.226
GREAT. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. I'M

03:06:11.293 --> 03:06:13.662
HERE TO PRESENT SENATE JOINT

03:06:13.729 --> 03:06:16.198
RESOLUTION ONE, WHICH WOULD

03:06:16.265 --> 03:06:18.834
BLANKET RESCIND ALL OF

03:06:18.901 --> 03:06:21.470
CALIFORNIA'S CALLS FOR

03:06:21.537 --> 03:06:22.304
CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION OVER

03:06:22.371 --> 03:06:27.109
THE LAST CENTURY. PLUS, WE HAVE

03:06:27.175 --> 03:06:28.810
WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE

03:06:28.877 --> 03:06:33.482
THERE ARE FOLKS IN CONGRESS WHO

03:06:33.549 --> 03:06:37.152
HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY BELIEVE

03:06:37.219 --> 03:06:38.520
THAT ENOUGH STATES HAVE ALREADY

03:06:38.587 --> 03:06:40.455
CALLED FOR A CONSTITUTIONAL

03:06:40.522 --> 03:06:41.690
CONVENTION IN ORDER TO TRIGGER

03:06:41.757 --> 03:06:44.226
ONE. REGARDLESS, WE KNOW THAT WE

03:06:44.293 --> 03:06:47.496
ARE APPROACHING THE MAGIC NUMBER

03:06:47.563 --> 03:06:52.568
OF 34 STATES, AND WE ARE. WHILE

03:06:52.634 --> 03:06:55.003
I THINK PROBABLY ALL OF US,

03:06:55.070 --> 03:06:56.538
PROBABLY ON BOTH SIDES OF THE

03:06:56.605 --> 03:06:58.340
AISLE, AGREE THAT THERE ARE

03:06:58.407 --> 03:06:59.575
THINGS THAT SHOULD CHANGE IN THE

03:06:59.641 --> 03:07:01.510
CONSTITUTION, WE MAY DISAGREE

03:07:01.577 --> 03:07:03.078
ABOUT WHAT THOSE CHANGES SHOULD

03:07:03.145 --> 03:07:05.414
BE. HAVING A CONSTITUTIONAL

03:07:05.480 --> 03:07:07.649
CONVENTION NOW COULD BE AN

03:07:07.716 --> 03:07:10.152
ABSOLUTE DISASTER FOR OUR

03:07:10.218 --> 03:07:11.620
DEMOCRACY, FOR BASIC CIVIL

03:07:11.687 --> 03:07:13.789
RIGHTS, FOR CALIFORNIA'S

03:07:13.855 --> 03:07:18.460
STANDING IN IN THE UNION. AND

03:07:18.527 --> 03:07:21.063
EVEN THOUGH EACH OF THESE CALLS

03:07:21.129 --> 03:07:22.030
FOR A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION

03:07:22.097 --> 03:07:23.832
HAS BEEN LIMITED TO A SPECIFIC

03:07:23.899 --> 03:07:27.235
SUBJECT, IT IS UNCLEAR AT BEST

03:07:27.302 --> 03:07:30.339
IF YOU CAN HAVE A SINGLE SUBJECT

03:07:30.405 --> 03:07:31.173
CONSTITUTION. AND WE COULD HAVE

03:07:31.239 --> 03:07:32.874
WHAT'S KNOWN AS A RUNAWAY

03:07:32.941 --> 03:07:34.309
CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION, WHICH

03:07:34.376 --> 03:07:36.612
COULD REWRITE EVERYTHING, AND

03:07:36.678 --> 03:07:39.715
THEN WE'D HAVE TO SPEND THE NEXT

03:07:39.781 --> 03:07:41.516
DECADE, TWO DECADES, FIGHTING

03:07:41.583 --> 03:07:44.086
STATE BY STATE RATIFICATION. IF

03:07:44.152 --> 03:07:46.588
IT WERE A BAD RESULT. WE HAVE

03:07:46.655 --> 03:07:48.857
GOTTEN BIPARTISAN SUPPORT ON

03:07:48.924 --> 03:07:50.425
THIS BECAUSE I THINK TWO PARTIES

03:07:50.492 --> 03:07:52.961
MAYBE COME AT IT FROM DIFFERENT

03:07:53.028 --> 03:07:54.630
DIRECTIONS. AND I WILL SAY THAT

03:07:54.696 --> 03:07:56.264
SEVERAL OF THE CALLS FOR

03:07:56.331 --> 03:07:57.366
CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION ARE ON

03:07:57.432 --> 03:07:59.668
SUBJECTS THAT I SUPPORT, BUT THE

03:07:59.735 --> 03:08:02.137
RISK IS JUST TOO HIGH. SO IT'S

03:08:02.204 --> 03:08:04.239
TIME JUST FOR CALIFORNIA TO STEP

03:08:04.306 --> 03:08:06.074
AWAY AND RESCIND THESE CALLS. I

03:08:06.141 --> 03:08:07.909
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE

03:08:07.976 --> 03:08:10.345
WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS

03:08:10.412 --> 03:08:12.080
DORA ROSE, DEPUTY DIRECTOR AT

03:08:12.147 --> 03:08:13.915
THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS OF

03:08:13.982 --> 03:08:16.351
CALIFORNIA, AND PROFESSOR VIKRAM

03:08:16.418 --> 03:08:19.354
AMAR, WHO'S A PROFESSOR OF LAW

03:08:19.421 --> 03:08:21.423
AT UC DAVIS LAW SCHOOL. THANK

03:08:21.490 --> 03:08:22.958
YOU BOTH. GOOD MORNING, CHAIR

03:08:23.025 --> 03:08:24.459
MEMBERS. DR. ROSE, DEPUTY

03:08:24.526 --> 03:08:25.527
DIRECTOR WITH THE LEAGUE OF

03:08:25.594 --> 03:08:27.362
WOMEN VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA HERE

03:08:27.429 --> 03:08:29.865
TODAY IS THE SPONSOR OF SJ ONE.

03:08:29.931 --> 03:08:32.668
SO THE LEAGUE IS ACTUALLY LONG

03:08:32.734 --> 03:08:34.102
CAUTIONED AGAINST THE PERILS OF

03:08:34.169 --> 03:08:36.405
ARTICLE FIVE CONVENTIONS ACROSS

03:08:36.471 --> 03:08:38.106
MULTIPLE ADMINISTRATIONS,

03:08:38.173 --> 03:08:39.441
REGARDLESS OF PARTY. IT'S JUST

03:08:39.508 --> 03:08:40.509
SOMETHING THAT OUR NATIONAL

03:08:40.575 --> 03:08:42.044
LEAGUE IN PARTICULAR HAS HAD

03:08:42.110 --> 03:08:44.579
GREAT CONCERNS ABOUT, BECAUSE

03:08:44.646 --> 03:08:46.481
THERE ARE NO RULES OR GUARDRAILS

03:08:46.548 --> 03:08:47.716
IN ARTICLE FIVE THAT LIMIT THE

03:08:47.783 --> 03:08:49.651
SCOPE OF CONSTITUTIONAL

03:08:49.718 --> 03:08:51.653
CONVENTIONS, POTENTIALLY PLACING

03:08:51.720 --> 03:08:53.588
EVERY CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT AND

03:08:53.655 --> 03:08:55.557
CIVIL LIBERTY THAT WE HAVE AT

03:08:55.624 --> 03:08:57.492
RISK. AND IN TODAY'S POLITICAL

03:08:57.559 --> 03:08:58.660
CLIMATE, THE HAZARDS ARE EVEN

03:08:58.727 --> 03:09:01.129
MORE GRAVE, EVEN IF IT'S CALLED

03:09:01.196 --> 03:09:02.731
FOR A SINGLE ISSUE. ONCE IT'S

03:09:02.798 --> 03:09:04.666
CONVENED, A CONVENTION BECOMES A

03:09:04.733 --> 03:09:07.636
RUNAWAY TRAIN. AS SENATOR WIENER

03:09:07.703 --> 03:09:09.571
ALLUDED TO, ABLE TO REWRITE ANY

03:09:09.638 --> 03:09:12.340
PART OF OUR CONSTITUTION WITH NO

03:09:12.407 --> 03:09:13.642
MECHANISMS IN PLACE TO STOP IT.

03:09:13.709 --> 03:09:16.645
AS FORMER CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN

03:09:16.712 --> 03:09:19.114
BURGER WARNED, THERE IS NO WAY

03:09:19.181 --> 03:09:20.482
TO EFFECTIVELY LIMIT OR MUZZLE

03:09:20.549 --> 03:09:23.018
THE ACTIONS OF A CONSTITUTIONAL

03:09:23.085 --> 03:09:26.121
CONVENTION. COMMON CAUSE HAS

03:09:26.188 --> 03:09:27.489
ACTUALLY ASSESSED THAT THERE'S

03:09:27.556 --> 03:09:29.458
28 STATES THAT HAVE ACTIVE CALLS

03:09:29.524 --> 03:09:30.459
FOR CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTIONS

03:09:30.525 --> 03:09:32.527
ON VARIOUS TOPICS. WE BELIEVE

03:09:32.594 --> 03:09:34.129
THAT CALIFORNIA HAS SEVEN ACTIVE

03:09:34.196 --> 03:09:35.664
CALLS IN THE BOOKS. IT COULD BE

03:09:35.731 --> 03:09:37.165
FIVE, ACCORDING TO THE STAFF

03:09:37.232 --> 03:09:38.934
ANALYSIS, BUT IN ANY CASE,

03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:39.935
RESCINDING THEM HELPS ENSURE

03:09:40.001 --> 03:09:42.471
THAT OUR STATE, WHICH IS KNOWN

03:09:42.537 --> 03:09:43.805
FOR PROTECTING CIVIL RIGHTS AND

03:09:43.872 --> 03:09:45.140
LIBERTIES, DOESN'T HELP OPEN THE

03:09:45.207 --> 03:09:46.908
DOOR TO A PROCESS THAT COULD

03:09:46.975 --> 03:09:48.910
UNDERMINE THEM ENTIRELY. THE

03:09:48.977 --> 03:09:51.446
THREAT HERE IS REALLY REAL.

03:09:51.513 --> 03:09:53.248
WE'VE ALREADY SEEN THE FEDERAL

03:09:53.315 --> 03:09:54.349
ADMINISTRATION SHRUGGING OFF

03:09:54.416 --> 03:09:55.450
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS IN PURSUIT

03:09:55.517 --> 03:09:57.285
OF THEIR POLITICAL AGENDA. FAR

03:09:57.352 --> 03:09:58.854
RIGHT GROUPS, INCLUDING ALLIES

03:09:58.920 --> 03:10:00.122
OF PRESIDENT TRUMP, HAVE

03:10:00.188 --> 03:10:01.823
ACTUALLY CALLED FOR A CONVENTION

03:10:01.890 --> 03:10:03.725
THAT COULD END UP TARGETING

03:10:03.792 --> 03:10:05.193
REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM PROTECTIONS

03:10:05.260 --> 03:10:06.928
FOR LGBTQ PLUS PEOPLE AND

03:10:06.995 --> 03:10:07.763
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. YOU KNOW,

03:10:07.829 --> 03:10:10.699
THE LIST GOES ON. WE NEED TO

03:10:10.766 --> 03:10:12.701
BELIEVE WHAT THEY ARE TELLING US

03:10:12.768 --> 03:10:14.169
RIGHT NOW. THERE'S ONE

03:10:14.236 --> 03:10:15.237
INFLUENTIAL GROUP THAT'S

03:10:15.303 --> 03:10:17.072
CIRCULATING A PETITION THAT

03:10:17.139 --> 03:10:19.608
STATES, SIGN OUR OPEN LETTER TO

03:10:19.674 --> 03:10:21.743
PRESIDENT TRUMP. ONLY AN ARTICLE

03:10:21.810 --> 03:10:22.878
FIVE CONVENTION CAN MAKE HIS

03:10:22.944 --> 03:10:24.279
ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGES

03:10:24.346 --> 03:10:26.548
PERMANENT. RIGHT? SJ SENDS A

03:10:26.615 --> 03:10:28.016
CLEAR MESSAGE CALIFORNIA WILL

03:10:28.083 --> 03:10:29.451
NOT BE COMPLICIT IN DISMANTLING

03:10:29.518 --> 03:10:31.586
OUR DEMOCRACY OR THE RIGHTS THAT

03:10:31.653 --> 03:10:33.155
WE FOUGHT SO HARD TO PROTECT.

03:10:33.221 --> 03:10:34.689
LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS URGES AN

03:10:34.756 --> 03:10:35.857
I VOTE TO REMOVE US FROM THE

03:10:35.924 --> 03:10:37.526
SLATE OF STATES THAT ARE

03:10:37.592 --> 03:10:39.961
SUPPORTING THIS DANGEROUS PATH.

03:10:40.028 --> 03:10:42.631
THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL. GOOD

03:10:42.697 --> 03:10:44.432
MORNING. MY NAME IS VIC AMAR.

03:10:44.499 --> 03:10:46.034
I'M A PROFESSOR OF LAW AT UC

03:10:46.101 --> 03:10:48.303
DAVIS. I FOCUS ON CONSTITUTIONAL

03:10:48.370 --> 03:10:49.504
LAW, AND I'VE WRITTEN

03:10:49.571 --> 03:10:50.605
EXTENSIVELY ABOUT CONSTITUTIONAL

03:10:50.672 --> 03:10:51.940
CHANGE. AND I JUST WANT TO OFFER

03:10:52.007 --> 03:10:54.309
A FEW OBSERVATIONS FOR YOUR

03:10:54.376 --> 03:10:55.544
CONSIDERATION. FIRST,

03:10:55.610 --> 03:10:56.845
CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE IS A GOOD

03:10:56.912 --> 03:10:57.879
THING. MOST OF THE GREAT PARTS

03:10:57.946 --> 03:10:59.648
OF OUR CONSTITUTION ARE A RESULT

03:10:59.714 --> 03:11:02.751
OF CHANGE OF AMENDMENT. BUT THIS

03:11:02.818 --> 03:11:03.885
PARTICULAR PATH TO

03:11:03.952 --> 03:11:05.253
CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE IS

03:11:05.320 --> 03:11:07.022
FRAUGHT. WE'VE NEVER HAD A

03:11:07.088 --> 03:11:09.324
CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION SINCE

03:11:09.391 --> 03:11:10.725
1787, AND THE CONSTITUTION'S

03:11:10.792 --> 03:11:12.627
WORDS THEMSELVES ARE SO SPARSE

03:11:12.694 --> 03:11:13.995
AS TO WHAT THE CONVENTION WOULD

03:11:14.062 --> 03:11:15.764
LOOK LIKE THAT THERE'S JUST

03:11:15.831 --> 03:11:16.565
TREMENDOUS UNCERTAINTY. OVER

03:11:16.631 --> 03:11:17.732
THREE DECADES AGO, MY FRIEND AND

03:11:17.799 --> 03:11:19.067
COLLEAGUE LARRY TRIBE FROM

03:11:19.134 --> 03:11:21.236
HARVARD WROTE A SHORT PIECE THAT

03:11:21.303 --> 03:11:22.604
IDENTIFIED DOZENS OF UNANSWERED

03:11:22.671 --> 03:11:24.673
QUESTIONS. LET ME JUST MENTION

03:11:24.739 --> 03:11:25.340
SEVERAL OF THEM FOR YOU. FIRST,

03:11:25.407 --> 03:11:26.975
IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER EACH

03:11:27.042 --> 03:11:28.743
STATE AT THIS CONVENTION WOULD

03:11:28.810 --> 03:11:31.246
BE REPRESENTED EQUALLY, OR, AS

03:11:31.313 --> 03:11:32.681
IN THE HOUSE OF THE UNITED

03:11:32.747 --> 03:11:34.516
STATES OR IN THE CALIFORNIA

03:11:34.583 --> 03:11:36.117
LEGISLATURE. ONE PERSON, ONE

03:11:36.184 --> 03:11:37.886
VOTE WOULD GOVERN. THAT'S A BIG

03:11:37.953 --> 03:11:39.087
DEAL. IF CALIFORNIA IS JUST ONE

03:11:39.154 --> 03:11:41.456
OF 50 IN A CONVENTION, THAT'S

03:11:41.523 --> 03:11:43.358
VERY DIFFERENT THAN IF IT HAS TO

03:11:43.425 --> 03:11:44.059
SAY THAT IT SHOULD DESERVE, MAY

03:11:44.125 --> 03:11:45.293
A STATE INSIST THAT ITS

03:11:45.360 --> 03:11:47.262
APPLICATIONS BE LIMITED TO

03:11:47.329 --> 03:11:48.530
SUBJECTS, AS THE SENATOR

03:11:48.597 --> 03:11:49.497
MENTIONED? NOT CLEAR THAT

03:11:49.564 --> 03:11:51.666
WHETHER THAT WOULD BE RESPECTED,

03:11:51.733 --> 03:11:53.668
HOW CLOSE IN TIME OR SUBJECT

03:11:53.735 --> 03:11:55.437
MATTER MUCH MUST THE VARIOUS

03:11:55.503 --> 03:11:57.472
CALLS BE MADE? CAN CONGRESS

03:11:57.539 --> 03:11:59.241
CHOOSE NOT TO PROPOSE AMENDMENTS

03:11:59.307 --> 03:12:00.675
THAT THE CONVENTION COMES UP

03:12:00.742 --> 03:12:02.244
WITH? ALL THESE ARE HUGE

03:12:02.310 --> 03:12:03.144
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS. THIS IS A

03:12:03.211 --> 03:12:06.114
VERY RISKY WAY TO GO. IN THE

03:12:06.181 --> 03:12:07.916
1970S, PROPONENTS OF

03:12:07.983 --> 03:12:09.351
CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTIONS SAID,

03:12:09.417 --> 03:12:10.652
WELL, CONGRESS COULD PROVIDE

03:12:10.719 --> 03:12:13.021
RULES THAT WOULD MAKE THIS THING

03:12:13.088 --> 03:12:14.923
REGULABLE Ã. I DON'T KNOW THAT

03:12:14.990 --> 03:12:16.658
THAT'S TRUE. THAT'S ONE OF THE

03:12:16.725 --> 03:12:17.959
BIG UNANSWERED QUESTIONS. AND B,

03:12:18.026 --> 03:12:19.394
I'M NOT SURE I TRUST CONGRESS

03:12:19.461 --> 03:12:20.929
THESE DAYS TO DO MUCH

03:12:20.996 --> 03:12:22.697
GUARDRAILS, TO DO MUCH

03:12:22.764 --> 03:12:24.165
SAFEGUARDING OF ANYTHING. FINAL

03:12:24.232 --> 03:12:25.700
QUESTION WILL IT BE EFFECTIVE TO

03:12:25.767 --> 03:12:27.035
TRY TO RESCIND THIS? WELL,

03:12:27.102 --> 03:12:27.936
THAT'S NOT EVEN ENTIRELY CLEAR.

03:12:28.003 --> 03:12:30.372
THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS

03:12:30.438 --> 03:12:31.706
THAT'S UNRESOLVED. CAN A STATE

03:12:31.773 --> 03:12:32.607
RESCIND? I THINK THEY SHOULD BE

03:12:32.674 --> 03:12:33.642
ABLE TO RESCIND. I THINK THE

03:12:33.708 --> 03:12:35.577
BETTER ARGUMENTS ARE IN THAT

03:12:35.644 --> 03:12:36.811
DIRECTION. THERE'S NO HARM OR NO

03:12:36.878 --> 03:12:38.813
REASON NOT TO TRY. AND THE ONE

03:12:38.880 --> 03:12:40.982
ANALOGY THAT I'D CLOSE WITH IS,

03:12:41.049 --> 03:12:42.651
EVEN THOUGH THERE'S BEEN SOME

03:12:42.717 --> 03:12:43.785
PERFORMATIVE ASSERTIONS,

03:12:43.852 --> 03:12:45.186
INCLUDING BY LEADERS OF THIS

03:12:45.253 --> 03:12:47.656
STATE, THAT THE ERA HAS BEEN

03:12:47.722 --> 03:12:48.857
ADOPTED AS PART OF THE

03:12:48.924 --> 03:12:49.958
CONSTITUTION, THERE'S A

03:12:50.025 --> 03:12:51.092
CONSENSUS THAT IT HAS NOT BEEN

03:12:51.159 --> 03:12:52.460
ADOPTED, IN PART BECAUSE OF THE

03:12:52.527 --> 03:12:54.462
RESCISSIONS OF THE ERA BY ALMOST

03:12:54.529 --> 03:12:56.164
ALL LEGAL EXPERTS ARE CONSIDERED

03:12:56.231 --> 03:12:57.465
TO BE EFFECTIVE RESCISSIONS. SO

03:12:57.532 --> 03:12:59.334
TOO WITH THIS. THANK YOU.

03:12:59.401 --> 03:13:02.404
PROFESSOR, IS THERE ANYONE ELSE

03:13:02.470 --> 03:13:08.243
HERE IN SUPPORT OF SCR ONE?

03:13:08.310 --> 03:13:09.344
MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS MARTY

03:13:09.411 --> 03:13:11.279
LOPEZ WITH THE CALIFORNIA NURSES

03:13:11.346 --> 03:13:12.647
ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. THANK

03:13:12.714 --> 03:13:16.384
YOU. IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN

03:13:16.451 --> 03:13:17.485
OPPOSITION TO SCR ONE? ALL

03:13:17.552 --> 03:13:18.887
RIGHT. WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO

03:13:18.954 --> 03:13:20.455
THE COMMITTEE. ANY QUESTIONS?

03:13:20.522 --> 03:13:22.924
MOTIONS TO MOVE THE BILL. WE'D

03:13:22.991 --> 03:13:25.493
LOVE TO BE ADDED AS A THANK YOU.

03:13:25.560 --> 03:13:27.762
IS THERE A SECOND TO DO SO? AND

03:13:27.829 --> 03:13:28.830
WE HAVE A SECOND ASSEMBLY

03:13:28.897 --> 03:13:29.931
MEMBER. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR.

03:13:29.998 --> 03:13:31.900
JUST A QUICK QUESTION. FIRST OF

03:13:31.967 --> 03:13:33.068
ALL, YOU HAVE GREAT WITNESSES.

03:13:33.134 --> 03:13:34.135
PROFESSOR MÀ WAS A GUEST

03:13:34.202 --> 03:13:35.670
LECTURER IN MY LAW CLASS WHEN AS

03:13:35.737 --> 03:13:39.307
A SOPHOMORE IN COLLEGE AT YOUR

03:13:39.374 --> 03:13:40.342
BROTHER'S CLASS, PROFESSOR

03:13:40.408 --> 03:13:42.210
KILMER, I REMEMBER THAT DAY. YOU

03:13:42.277 --> 03:13:42.911
WERE BRILLIANT. YOU WERE

03:13:42.978 --> 03:13:44.713
BRILLIANT, AND YOU, YOU MADE

03:13:44.779 --> 03:13:46.448
SOME GREAT POINTS. SO THANKS FOR

03:13:46.514 --> 03:13:46.948
BEING HERE. BUT IN ALL

03:13:47.015 --> 03:13:49.084
SERIOUSNESS, I GUESS I DON'T SEE

03:13:49.150 --> 03:13:51.119
ANY HARM IN THIS, BUT MY BIG

03:13:51.186 --> 03:13:53.188
QUESTION WITH THIS IS THE

03:13:53.254 --> 03:13:54.389
CONVENTION. WOULD ANYTHING THAT

03:13:54.456 --> 03:13:56.558
CAME FROM A CONVENTION, AS THE

03:13:56.624 --> 03:13:57.926
ANALYSIS NOTES, WOULD HAVE TO BE

03:13:57.993 --> 03:14:00.028
RATIFIED BY THREE QUARTERS OF

03:14:00.095 --> 03:14:01.262
THE STATES? OKAY, SO THIS SEEMS

03:14:01.329 --> 03:14:03.698
A BIT HYSTERICAL, GIVEN THAT

03:14:03.765 --> 03:14:05.200
GIVEN KIND OF THREE QUARTERS OF

03:14:05.266 --> 03:14:07.635
THE STATES WOULD HAVE TO AGREE

03:14:07.702 --> 03:14:08.737
TO ANY AMENDMENT OF OUR

03:14:08.803 --> 03:14:10.038
CONSTITUTION AND THEREFORE KIND

03:14:10.105 --> 03:14:11.940
OF TAKING A STEP HERE WHERE WE

03:14:12.007 --> 03:14:13.675
ARE, WHY DO WE REALLY NEED TO DO

03:14:13.742 --> 03:14:16.411
THIS? I MEAN, IN EFFECT, IF WE

03:14:16.478 --> 03:14:18.480
HAD THE WORST CASE SCENARIO AT A

03:14:18.546 --> 03:14:20.749
CONVENTION, I THINK A LOT OF

03:14:20.815 --> 03:14:21.850
GOOD COULD COME FROM A

03:14:21.916 --> 03:14:23.485
CONVENTION. I MEAN, I, I COULD

03:14:23.551 --> 03:14:24.119
TALK ABOUT FIRST AMENDMENT, YOU

03:14:24.185 --> 03:14:25.787
KNOW, CHANGES I WOULD DO RIGHT

03:14:25.854 --> 03:14:27.155
NOW IN TERMS OF CAMPAIGN FINANCE

03:14:27.222 --> 03:14:28.523
AND OTHER THINGS. BUT LET'S JUST

03:14:28.590 --> 03:14:29.758
SAY THAT SOMETHING COMES OF IT

03:14:29.824 --> 03:14:32.327
THAT THAT DOES, YOU KNOW, PEEL

03:14:32.394 --> 03:14:32.827
BACK CIVIL LIBERTIES OR

03:14:32.894 --> 03:14:35.830
SOMETHING GROTESQUE. WHAT IS THE

03:14:35.897 --> 03:14:36.965
LIKELIHOOD THAT THREE QUARTERS

03:14:37.032 --> 03:14:37.866
OF THE STATES WOULD ACTUALLY

03:14:37.932 --> 03:14:39.367
AGREE WITH THAT? WELL, IT

03:14:39.434 --> 03:14:41.536
DEPENDS AND IT DEPENDS WHAT THEY

03:14:41.603 --> 03:14:43.505
DO. AND WE KNOW RIGHT NOW. AND

03:14:43.571 --> 03:14:48.376
IF YOU LOOK AT THE US SENATE,

03:14:48.443 --> 03:14:50.578
YOU CAN SEE THAT OUR IN TERMS OF

03:14:50.645 --> 03:14:52.313
WHEN YOU LOOK AT ANYTHING THAT'S

03:14:52.380 --> 03:14:54.616
STRUCTURED BY STATE, IS NOT THE

03:14:54.682 --> 03:14:56.117
MOST DEMOCRATIC THING IN THE

03:14:56.184 --> 03:14:58.453
WORLD. AND SO THEY COULD PUT OUT

03:14:58.520 --> 03:15:06.061
A PROPOSAL THAT WITH NO TIMELINE

03:15:06.127 --> 03:15:08.530
TO RATIFY IT, OR 20 YEARS OR

03:15:08.596 --> 03:15:10.598
SOME HUGE AMOUNT OF TIME, AND

03:15:10.665 --> 03:15:12.901
THEN THEY WOULD GO STATE BY

03:15:12.967 --> 03:15:14.836
STATE. AND I AGREE, 3038 STATES

03:15:14.903 --> 03:15:17.605
IS A IS DEFINITELY A BIG HILL TO

03:15:17.672 --> 03:15:20.341
CLIMB. BUT ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS

03:15:20.408 --> 03:15:21.843
IF, LET'S SAY THERE WERE ONE

03:15:21.910 --> 03:15:24.813
PARTY THAT REALLY WANTED IT, YOU

03:15:24.879 --> 03:15:26.481
JUST HAVE TO TAKE OVER

03:15:26.548 --> 03:15:29.050
LEGISLATURE ONE TIME FOR A TWO

03:15:29.117 --> 03:15:31.920
YEAR PERIOD, AND THEN YOU DO IT

03:15:31.986 --> 03:15:33.354
AND THEN IT'S UNCLEAR. CAN YOU

03:15:33.421 --> 03:15:34.889
RESCIND YOUR RATIFICATION? I

03:15:34.956 --> 03:15:38.326
DON'T KNOW, AND SO IS IT HARD?

03:15:38.393 --> 03:15:40.261
ABSOLUTELY. I TOTALLY AGREE WITH

03:15:40.328 --> 03:15:42.664
THAT. IS THAT A RISK THAT I THAT

03:15:42.730 --> 03:15:44.532
WE SHOULD BE TAKING RIGHT NOW? I

03:15:44.599 --> 03:15:45.867
PERSONALLY DON'T THINK SO. AND I

03:15:45.934 --> 03:15:48.436
AGREE WITH YOU THERE. I CAN COME

03:15:48.503 --> 03:15:50.405
UP WITH A WHOLE LIST OF THINGS I

03:15:50.472 --> 03:15:52.040
WANT TO CHANGE IN THE

03:15:52.107 --> 03:15:52.707
CONSTITUTION, AS CAN PEOPLE WHO

03:15:52.774 --> 03:15:54.542
I THINK YOU AND I PROBABLY WOULD

03:15:54.609 --> 03:15:56.344
DISAGREE WITH. I'LL SECOND IT.

03:15:56.411 --> 03:15:58.513
THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT WE

03:15:58.580 --> 03:16:00.115
DO HAVE A SECOND FROM

03:16:00.181 --> 03:16:01.249
ASSEMBLYMEMBER SANCHEZ. ARE

03:16:01.316 --> 03:16:02.484
THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR

03:16:02.550 --> 03:16:04.219
COMMENTS? ALL RIGHT. WELL,

03:16:04.285 --> 03:16:06.221
ANOTHER BIPARTISAN MOTION HAS

03:16:06.287 --> 03:16:08.356
BEEN PLACED ON THE ON THE FLOOR

03:16:08.423 --> 03:16:09.724
HERE. SO DON'T BELIEVE WHAT THEY

03:16:09.791 --> 03:16:11.259
SAY ABOUT ME. I KNOW. RIGHT.

03:16:11.326 --> 03:16:14.395
SENATOR WIENER, YOU KNOW THIS

03:16:14.462 --> 03:16:15.630
DOESN'T GET PUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA,

03:16:15.697 --> 03:16:17.765
RIGHT. EXACTLY. SENATOR NGUYEN

03:16:17.832 --> 03:16:19.834
IS A GREAT COMPROMISER. BUT

03:16:19.901 --> 03:16:20.902
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS

03:16:20.969 --> 03:16:23.004
FORWARD. WOULD YOU LIKE TO

03:16:23.071 --> 03:16:24.139
CLOSE? I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A

03:16:24.205 --> 03:16:26.841

ABOUT THE JUDICIARY HERE, EVEN

THOUGH I'M A PRE-LAW MAJOR AND

03:17:33.474 --> 03:17:35.543

03:17:35.610 --> 03:17:37.946
I'VE LEARNED A LOT. THANK YOU.

03:17:38.012 --> 03:17:40.148
THANK YOU, MISTER CHAIR. I'M

YOU ARE ALL TOO AWARE,

03:17:49.924 --> 03:17:51.226
CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS HAS

03:17:51.292 --> 03:17:53.394
REACHED A CRITICAL POINT,

03:17:53.461 --> 03:17:54.829
PROFOUNDLY AFFECTING THE STATE'S

03:17:54.896 --> 03:17:56.731
ECONOMIC STABILITY AND THE

03:17:56.798 --> 03:17:59.234
WELL-BEING OF ITS RESIDENTS. SB

03:17:59.300 --> 03:18:01.302

03:18:01.369 --> 03:18:03.638

PROJECTS CAN MOVE FORWARD, AS

03:18:05.740 --> 03:18:07.542
LONG AS THE COMMUNITY HOUSING

03:18:07.609 --> 03:18:10.011
PLAN WAS IN EFFECT AT THE TIME

03:18:10.078 --> 03:18:11.279
OF PERMITTING. I'M GOING TO

03:18:11.346 --> 03:18:12.747
RESTATE THAT BECAUSE THAT'S A

03:18:12.814 --> 03:18:15.316
KEY TO THIS BILL. SB 611 IS

03:18:15.383 --> 03:18:18.219
CRUCIAL TO ENSURING THAT LEGALLY

03:18:18.286 --> 03:18:20.388
APPROVED DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS

03:18:20.455 --> 03:18:22.924
CAN MOVE FORWARD. AS LONG AS THE

03:18:22.991 --> 03:18:24.692
COMMUNITY HOUSING PLANS WERE IN

03:18:24.759 --> 03:18:26.294

EXAMPLE, IN THE LARGEST COUNTY

03:18:37.038 --> 03:18:38.806
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

03:18:38.873 --> 03:18:40.975
ALONE, DELAYS TO COMMUNITY PLANS

03:18:41.042 --> 03:18:43.411
CAN PREVENT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

03:18:43.478 --> 03:18:45.213
HOUSING UNITS FROM BEING BUILT.

03:18:45.280 --> 03:18:48.082
IN 2012, THE HOLLYWOOD COMMUNITY

03:18:48.149 --> 03:18:51.085
PLAN WAS ADOPTED, BUT LITIGATION

03:18:51.152 --> 03:18:53.521

DESPITE PENDING LITIGATION.

03:19:15.543 --> 03:19:17.345
UNFORTUNATELY, THOSE PROTECTIONS

03:19:17.412 --> 03:19:20.448
EXPIRED ON JANUARY 1ST, 2025,

03:19:20.515 --> 03:19:22.383
WHICH MEANS WE ARE ONCE AGAIN

03:19:22.450 --> 03:19:24.819

RESTORES THESE PROVISIONS,

03:19:30.024 --> 03:19:31.693
ENSURING THAT PROJECTS REMAIN

OUR HOLLYWOOD COMMUNITY PLAN,

03:20:09.630 --> 03:20:10.998
BUT PROGRESS WAS STALLED DUE TO

03:20:11.065 --> 03:20:12.800
CIVIL LITIGATION, AND AS A

03:20:12.867 --> 03:20:13.701
RESULT, A JUDGE HALTED ALL

03:20:13.768 --> 03:20:15.203

INCLUDES THE PROPOSAL OF 30,000

03:20:27.515 --> 03:20:28.916
ADDITIONAL HOUSING UNITS. THE

03:20:28.983 --> 03:20:30.118
PLAN HAS SINCE BEEN CHALLENGED

03:20:30.184 --> 03:20:32.253
AGAIN UNDER SEQUA, PUTTING US AT

03:20:32.320 --> 03:20:34.422

EVEN IF THE COMMUNITY PLAN IS

03:20:48.136 --> 03:20:49.871

INDIVIDUAL HOUSING PROJECT OR

03:20:54.942 --> 03:20:55.977
DEVELOPMENT. RATHER, IT WOULD

03:20:56.043 --> 03:20:57.578
PREVENT THE CEQA LITIGATION

03:20:57.645 --> 03:20:59.113

03:24:08.970 --> 03:24:13.574
RESULTED IN 26,103 TONS OF

03:24:13.641 --> 03:24:18.546
TRASH, OR 52.2 MILLION POUNDS OF

03:24:18.613 --> 03:24:21.482
TRASH, DEBRIS AND OVERGROWN

03:24:21.549 --> 03:24:23.017
VEGETATION TO BE PICKED UP. AS

03:24:23.084 --> 03:24:28.255
OF MAY 29TH, 2024, SB 757 WOULD

03:24:28.322 --> 03:24:30.091
AUTHORIZE THE LEGISLATIVE BODY

03:24:30.157 --> 03:24:32.760
OF A CITY OR COUNTY TO ESTABLISH

03:24:32.827 --> 03:24:35.496
A PROCEDURE TO USE A NUISANCE

03:24:35.563 --> 03:24:38.399
ABATEMENT LIEN OR A SPECIAL

03:24:38.466 --> 03:24:40.668
ASSESSMENT TO COLLECT ABATEMENT

03:24:40.735 --> 03:24:42.703
COSTS AND RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE

03:24:42.770 --> 03:24:46.307
COSTS UNTIL JANUARY 1ST, 2035.

03:24:46.374 --> 03:24:48.809
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS USE VARIOUS

03:24:48.876 --> 03:24:51.345
ENFORCEMENT STRATEGIES TO MAKE

03:24:51.412 --> 03:24:53.247
NEIGHBORHOODS, STREETS, PARKS,

03:24:53.314 --> 03:24:55.750
AND BUILDINGS SAFER. ONE

03:24:55.816 --> 03:24:58.519
IMPORTANT STRATEGY IS TO BE ABLE

03:24:58.586 --> 03:25:00.755
TO HOLD OWNERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR

03:25:00.821 --> 03:25:03.524
ALLOWING EXCESSIVE TRASH AND

03:25:03.591 --> 03:25:05.793
BIOLOGICAL HAZARDS ON THEIR

03:25:05.860 --> 03:25:07.561
PROPERTIES FOR OVER AN EXTENDED

03:25:07.628 --> 03:25:10.498
PERIOD OF TIME. DESPITE

03:25:10.564 --> 03:25:12.166
MUNICIPAL RULES AND NOTICES,

03:25:12.233 --> 03:25:14.735
SOME PROPERTY OWNERS MAINTAIN

03:25:14.802 --> 03:25:16.170
NUISANCES ON THEIR PROPERTIES

03:25:16.237 --> 03:25:18.039
WHILE IGNORING THE

03:25:18.105 --> 03:25:19.874
ADMINISTRATIVE FINES AND

03:25:19.940 --> 03:25:21.642
CITATIONS IMPOSED BY LOCAL

03:25:21.709 --> 03:25:24.111
GOVERNMENT, THEREBY PUTTING THE

03:25:24.178 --> 03:25:26.247
FINANCIAL BURDEN ON THE LOCAL

03:25:26.313 --> 03:25:28.015
AGENCIES TO ENFORCE THESE FINES

03:25:28.082 --> 03:25:29.850
AND COLLECTIONS THROUGH THE

03:25:29.917 --> 03:25:31.752
COURTS. AFTER INCURRING

03:25:31.819 --> 03:25:33.487
SIGNIFICANT COSTS, ALLOWING

03:25:33.554 --> 03:25:35.189
LOCAL OFFICIALS TO COLLECT

03:25:35.256 --> 03:25:37.925
UNPAID ADMINISTRATIVE FINES WITH

03:25:37.992 --> 03:25:39.293
SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS AND

03:25:39.360 --> 03:25:41.295
ABATEMENT LIENS PUTS THE

03:25:41.362 --> 03:25:42.830
RESPONSIBILITY ON THE PROPERTY

03:25:42.897 --> 03:25:45.399
OWNER, WHO HAS CHOSEN TO ALLOW

03:25:45.466 --> 03:25:47.435
THE TRASH TO ACCUMULATE OVER AN

03:25:47.501 --> 03:25:51.372
EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. SB 757

03:25:51.439 --> 03:25:54.008
POLICY UPDATES ALLOWS NUISANCE

03:25:54.075 --> 03:25:55.476
ABATEMENT COSTS TO BE COLLECTED,

03:25:55.543 --> 03:25:57.712
WHICH CLEANS UP OUR STREETS AND

03:25:57.778 --> 03:26:00.147
VACANT LOTS FROM UNNECESSARY

03:26:00.214 --> 03:26:02.316
DEBRIS AND CLUTTER, AND

03:26:02.383 --> 03:26:03.784
REIMBURSES THE CITIES AND

03:26:03.851 --> 03:26:05.886
COUNTIES FROM BURDENSOME

03:26:05.953 --> 03:26:08.089
UNBUDGETED COSTS. DURING THE

03:26:08.155 --> 03:26:09.690
SENATE HEARING, TWO QUESTIONS

03:26:09.757 --> 03:26:11.692
WERE RAISED TO ME THAT I QUICKLY

03:26:11.759 --> 03:26:13.894
WANTED TO ADDRESS, AND I BRING

03:26:13.961 --> 03:26:15.629
FORWARD TO YOU TODAY. NUMBER

03:26:15.696 --> 03:26:17.531
ONE, WHAT ARE WE DOING TO

03:26:17.598 --> 03:26:19.600
ADDRESS THE DUE PROCESS WE

03:26:19.667 --> 03:26:22.770
FOLLOWED UP IN CITIES, ALL THE

03:26:22.837 --> 03:26:25.339
CITIES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE A

03:26:25.406 --> 03:26:27.775
NUISANCE ABATEMENT PROCESS. MY

03:26:27.842 --> 03:26:30.111
STAFF WAS BRINGING BACK THE PIE

03:26:30.177 --> 03:26:31.479
CHART. IT WASN'T HERE IN MY

03:26:31.545 --> 03:26:33.948
FOLDER, BUT TYPICALLY A CITY

03:26:34.014 --> 03:26:36.484
WILL NOTIFY AN INDIVIDUAL FIRST.

03:26:36.550 --> 03:26:38.452
THEY HAVE TO DRIVE AROUND AND

03:26:38.519 --> 03:26:40.087
SEE THAT THERE IS TRASH. THEN

03:26:40.154 --> 03:26:41.722
THEY HAVE TO IN FACT, LOOK UP

03:26:41.789 --> 03:26:44.091
WHO IS THE OWNER. ONCE THEY FIND

03:26:44.158 --> 03:26:45.860
THE OWNER, THEN THEY SEND THEM A

03:26:45.926 --> 03:26:47.661
NOTICE. YOU NEED TO PICK IT UP.

03:26:47.728 --> 03:26:49.864
MOST CITIES OFFER A FREE PICKUP.

03:26:49.930 --> 03:26:51.766
IF YOU HAVE TRASH THAT'S THERE

03:26:51.832 --> 03:26:53.534
THAT MAY. MAYBE YOU DIDN'T

03:26:53.601 --> 03:26:55.202
LEAVE, BUT SOMEONE ELSE LEFT.

03:26:55.269 --> 03:26:56.871
THEY GIVE THE PEOPLE USUALLY AT

03:26:56.937 --> 03:26:59.807
LEAST THREE OPPORTUNITIES BEFORE

03:26:59.874 --> 03:27:01.675
THE ITEMS ARE THEN PICKED UP AND

03:27:01.742 --> 03:27:04.145
A FEE IS CHARGED. THE SECOND

03:27:04.211 --> 03:27:06.714
ITEM HAS TO DO WITH WHAT CAN BE

03:27:06.781 --> 03:27:09.216
DONE TO ADDRESS LIENS BEING

03:27:09.283 --> 03:27:11.352
GIVEN TO LOWER INCOME RESIDENTS

03:27:11.418 --> 03:27:13.287
THAT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD

03:27:13.354 --> 03:27:15.656
THE CLEANUP. SO WE ALREADY HAD

03:27:15.723 --> 03:27:17.892
IN THE BILL, INCLUDING A

03:27:17.958 --> 03:27:20.661
HARDSHIP WAIVER. SO IF AN

03:27:20.728 --> 03:27:23.297
INDIVIDUAL WAS OLDER OR NOT OF

03:27:23.364 --> 03:27:25.466
INCOME, THEY COULD SEEK THE

03:27:25.533 --> 03:27:27.234
HARDSHIP WAIVER. THE COMMITTEE

03:27:27.301 --> 03:27:28.903
ASKED US TO CONSIDER LOOKING AT

03:27:28.969 --> 03:27:32.239
THE POVERTY LINE AND ALLOWING

03:27:32.306 --> 03:27:33.808
200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY

03:27:33.874 --> 03:27:35.743
LINE, WHICH MEANS SOMEONE WHO

03:27:35.810 --> 03:27:39.046
MAKES $40,000 OR LESS COULD

03:27:39.113 --> 03:27:41.582
RECEIVE A WAIVER. SO IF AN

03:27:41.649 --> 03:27:43.717
INDIVIDUAL OWNS A PROPERTY AND

03:27:43.784 --> 03:27:47.388
MAKES LESS THAN 40,000 AND THE

03:27:47.454 --> 03:27:48.022
TRASH WAS PICKED UP, THEY COULD

03:27:48.088 --> 03:27:50.925
RECEIVE A LINK TO THE SECOND

03:27:50.991 --> 03:27:52.293
QUESTION. AS I MENTIONED, WE

03:27:52.359 --> 03:27:54.094
CURRENTLY ALREADY HAVE THE

03:27:54.161 --> 03:27:56.030
HARDSHIP WAIVER, BUT WE HAVE

03:27:56.096 --> 03:27:57.431
RESPECTFULLY ACCEPTED THE

03:27:57.498 --> 03:28:00.434
COMMITTEE'S AMENDMENT. SB 757 IS

03:28:00.501 --> 03:28:03.537
A STRATEGY TOOLBOX THAT

03:28:03.604 --> 03:28:04.939
PRIORITIZES HEALTH, CLEANLINESS,

03:28:05.005 --> 03:28:07.842
AND SAFETY FOR RESIDENTS ACROSS

03:28:07.908 --> 03:28:09.777
CALIFORNIA. HERE WITH ME TODAY

03:28:09.844 --> 03:28:11.579
TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL

03:28:11.645 --> 03:28:14.048
IS CARLY SHELBY. ON BEHALF OF

03:28:14.114 --> 03:28:15.783
THE CONTRACT CITIES, WHICH

03:28:15.850 --> 03:28:18.352
INCLUDES OAKLAND AND COMPTON.

03:28:18.419 --> 03:28:22.323
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND GOOD

03:28:22.389 --> 03:28:23.490
MORNING, CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF

03:28:23.557 --> 03:28:25.259
THE COMMITTEE, CARLY SHELBY,

03:28:25.326 --> 03:28:26.927
HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CITIES OF

03:28:26.994 --> 03:28:28.462
OAKLAND AND COMPTON, TO VOICE

03:28:28.529 --> 03:28:29.930
OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR SENATE

03:28:29.997 --> 03:28:32.666
BILL 757 BY SENATOR RICHARDSON

03:28:32.733 --> 03:28:34.435
IN CITIES LIKE COMPTON AND

03:28:34.501 --> 03:28:35.636
OAKLAND, WHERE MANY RESIDENTS

03:28:35.703 --> 03:28:37.705
LIVE IN HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED

03:28:37.771 --> 03:28:39.607
NEIGHBORHOODS, CHRONIC NUISANCE

03:28:39.673 --> 03:28:40.875
PROPERTIES ARE NOT JUST BLIGHT,

03:28:40.941 --> 03:28:43.244
BUT THEY'RE DANGEROUS. THESE ARE

03:28:43.310 --> 03:28:45.379
OFTEN HOMES WITH EXPOSED WIRING,

03:28:45.446 --> 03:28:46.947
COLLAPSING ROOFS, AND

03:28:47.014 --> 03:28:48.315
UNPERMITTED CONVERSIONS. THEY

03:28:48.382 --> 03:28:51.118
POSE DIRECT RISKS TO TENANTS AND

03:28:51.185 --> 03:28:52.887
NEIGHBORS ALIKE, YET MANY ARE

03:28:52.953 --> 03:28:54.755
OWNED BY ABSENTEE LANDLORDS WHO

03:28:54.822 --> 03:28:56.390
KNOWINGLY IGNORE LOCAL ORDERS TO

03:28:56.457 --> 03:28:58.292
FIX THESE HAZARDS. RIGHT NOW,

03:28:58.359 --> 03:28:59.693
OUR ONLY OPTION TO RECOVER

03:28:59.760 --> 03:29:01.629
UNPAID FINES IS THROUGH LENGTHY,

03:29:01.695 --> 03:29:03.797
EXPENSIVE COURT BATTLES. THIS

03:29:03.864 --> 03:29:05.532
MEANS MONTHS, SOMETIMES YEARS OF

03:29:05.599 --> 03:29:07.735
DELAY WHILE UNSAFE CONDITIONS

03:29:07.801 --> 03:29:09.103
PERSIST. AND FOR CITIES LIKE

03:29:09.169 --> 03:29:11.038
COMPTON AND OAKLAND WITH LIMITED

03:29:11.105 --> 03:29:13.007
LEGAL RESOURCES AND OVERBURDENED

03:29:13.073 --> 03:29:14.842
BUDGETS, IT'S NOT A REALISTIC

03:29:14.909 --> 03:29:17.811
TOOL. SB 757 GIVES LOCAL

03:29:17.878 --> 03:29:18.846
GOVERNMENTS A MORE PRACTICAL,

03:29:18.913 --> 03:29:20.981
NARROWLY FOCUSED TOOL THE

03:29:21.048 --> 03:29:22.750
ABILITY TO RECOVER UNPAID

03:29:22.816 --> 03:29:23.317
ADMINISTRATIVE FINES THROUGH

03:29:23.384 --> 03:29:25.486
SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS OR NUISANCE

03:29:25.552 --> 03:29:27.788
ABATEMENT LIENS, BUT ONLY IN

03:29:27.855 --> 03:29:28.956
CASES WHERE THERE IS A GENUINE

03:29:29.023 --> 03:29:31.058
PUBLIC HEALTH, HEALTH OR SAFETY

03:29:31.125 --> 03:29:33.193
THREAT. IT INCLUDES BUILT IN

03:29:33.260 --> 03:29:34.728
EQUITY PRODUCTIONS SUCH AS A 60

03:29:34.795 --> 03:29:37.197
DAY CURE PERIOD, A HARDSHIP

03:29:37.264 --> 03:29:38.632
WAIVER, AS THE SENATOR

03:29:38.699 --> 03:29:39.833
MENTIONED, FOR THOSE TRYING TO

03:29:39.900 --> 03:29:41.535
COMPLY IN GOOD FAITH, AND A

03:29:41.602 --> 03:29:42.536
REQUIREMENT THAT ANY FUNDS

03:29:42.603 --> 03:29:44.738
COLLECTED BE REINVESTED INTO

03:29:44.805 --> 03:29:46.540
HOUSING, SUCH AS PERMIT

03:29:46.607 --> 03:29:47.574
PERMITTING IMPROVEMENTS AND

03:29:47.641 --> 03:29:49.443
REVOLVING LOAN FUNDS FOR

03:29:49.510 --> 03:29:51.211
REPAIRS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY

03:29:51.278 --> 03:29:53.147
CRITICAL IN PLACES LIKE COMPTON

03:29:53.213 --> 03:29:54.815
AND OAKLAND, WHERE MUCH OF THE

03:29:54.882 --> 03:29:56.650
HOUSING STOCK IS AGING AND MANY

03:29:56.717 --> 03:29:57.685
FAMILIES CAN'T AFFORD THE COST

03:29:57.751 --> 03:30:00.888
OF REMEDIATION ON THEIR OWN. SB

03:30:00.955 --> 03:30:02.423
757 ISN'T ABOUT PUNISHMENT, IT'S

03:30:02.489 --> 03:30:04.224
ABOUT GIVING CITIES THE MEANS TO

03:30:04.291 --> 03:30:05.592
PROTECT HEALTH AND SAFETY,

03:30:05.659 --> 03:30:06.827
PRESERVE HOUSING, AND BREAK

03:30:06.894 --> 03:30:08.095
CYCLES OF DISINVESTMENT THAT

03:30:08.162 --> 03:30:09.563
HAVE PLAGUED OUR COMMUNITIES FOR

03:30:09.630 --> 03:30:11.699
FAR TOO LONG. ON BEHALF OF THE

03:30:11.765 --> 03:30:12.633
CITIES OF COMPTON AND OAKLAND,

03:30:12.700 --> 03:30:14.501
WE RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR AYE

03:30:14.568 --> 03:30:16.003
VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IS

03:30:16.070 --> 03:30:17.538
THERE ANYONE ELSE HERE IN

03:30:17.604 --> 03:30:20.774
SUPPORT OF SB 757? HI. GOOD

03:30:20.841 --> 03:30:21.942
MORNING ERIC. WELL, ON BEHALF OF

03:30:22.009 --> 03:30:23.978
RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF

03:30:24.044 --> 03:30:25.279
CALIFORNIA AND THE CALIFORNIA

03:30:25.346 --> 03:30:27.014
ASSOCIATION OF CODE ENFORCEMENT

03:30:27.081 --> 03:30:27.815
OFFICERS AND STRONG SUPPORT.

03:30:27.881 --> 03:30:29.083
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. IS THERE

03:30:29.149 --> 03:30:32.286
ANYONE HERE IN OPPOSITION TO SB

03:30:32.353 --> 03:30:44.131
757? GOOD. TO KEEP THIS ORDER.

03:30:44.198 --> 03:30:48.769
HERE. GOOD MORNING, CHAIR AND

03:30:48.836 --> 03:30:50.604
MEMBERS. MY NAME IS BENJAMIN

03:30:50.671 --> 03:30:52.106
HENDERSON. I AM A POLICY

03:30:52.172 --> 03:30:53.440
ADVOCATE FOR THE WESTERN CENTER

03:30:53.507 --> 03:30:56.043
ON LAW AND POVERTY. I'M HERE TO

03:30:56.110 --> 03:30:59.646
RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SB 757.

03:30:59.713 --> 03:31:01.682
FIRST, I'D LIKE TO THANK SENATOR

03:31:01.749 --> 03:31:02.916
RICHARDSON'S OFFICE FOR

03:31:02.983 --> 03:31:05.319
WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE.

03:31:05.386 --> 03:31:06.787
UNFORTUNATELY, WE DO NOT SEE

03:31:06.854 --> 03:31:08.589
AMENDMENTS THAT SUFFICIENTLY

03:31:08.655 --> 03:31:10.357
REDUCE THE BILL'S POTENTIAL

03:31:10.424 --> 03:31:14.328
HARM. WE OPPOSE SB 757 BECAUSE

03:31:14.395 --> 03:31:16.964
IT REMOVES ONE OF THE ONLY DUE

03:31:17.031 --> 03:31:18.932
PROCESS PROTECTIONS HOMEOWNERS

03:31:18.999 --> 03:31:21.201
HAVE IN CODE ENFORCEMENT CASES,

03:31:21.268 --> 03:31:23.971
THE RIGHT TO JUDICIAL REVIEW

03:31:24.038 --> 03:31:26.373
BEFORE A LIEN IS PLACED ON THEIR

03:31:26.440 --> 03:31:27.775
PROPERTY. PROPERTY OWNERS OFTEN

03:31:27.841 --> 03:31:30.177
DON'T HAVE LEGAL COUNSEL, FACE

03:31:30.244 --> 03:31:32.112
STEEP FINES, MUST LET

03:31:32.179 --> 03:31:33.814
ENFORCEMENT ONTO THEIR PROPERTY,

03:31:33.881 --> 03:31:35.949
CAN LOSE APPEALS RIGHTS WITHIN

03:31:36.016 --> 03:31:38.452
DAYS. JUDICIAL OVERSIGHT IS

03:31:38.519 --> 03:31:41.055
OFTEN THE ONLY CHECK IN THAT

03:31:41.121 --> 03:31:43.223
PROCESS. WHILE THE BILL INTENDS

03:31:43.290 --> 03:31:45.225
TO TARGET BAD ACTORS, ITS SCOPE

03:31:45.292 --> 03:31:47.661
IS FAR BROADER. HOMEOWNERS COULD

03:31:47.728 --> 03:31:50.130
BE LEÓN FOR MINOR VIOLATIONS,

03:31:50.197 --> 03:31:52.966
LIKE AN UNPERMITTED GARAGE UNIT

03:31:53.033 --> 03:31:55.803
OR OLD CARS IN THEIR YARD. THE

03:31:55.869 --> 03:31:58.105
HARDSHIP WAIVER IS ALSO TOO

03:31:58.172 --> 03:31:59.773
NARROW. IT ONLY APPLIES TO

03:31:59.840 --> 03:32:02.643
PEOPLE OWNING UNDER 200% OF THE

03:32:02.709 --> 03:32:06.880
FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. JUST OVER

03:32:06.947 --> 03:32:09.483
$31,000 FOR ONE PERSON, AND

03:32:09.550 --> 03:32:11.718
REQUIRES A BONA FIDE EFFORT TO

03:32:11.785 --> 03:32:14.321
COMPLY, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO

03:32:14.388 --> 03:32:17.391
PAY OR EXCESSIVE FINES. WE'VE

03:32:17.458 --> 03:32:20.327
SEEN REAL WORLD CONSEQUENCES. A

03:32:20.394 --> 03:32:22.896
BLIND, LOW INCOME SENIOR IN

03:32:22.963 --> 03:32:26.834
OAKLAND HAD $53,000 IN FINES FOR

03:32:26.900 --> 03:32:29.269
YARD WASTE AND PEELING PAINT.

03:32:29.336 --> 03:32:31.805
HIS DISABILITY MADE COMPLIANCE

03:32:31.872 --> 03:32:34.541
IMPOSSIBLE. LEGAL AID INTERVENED

03:32:34.608 --> 03:32:37.111
JUST IN TIME TO PREVENT THE

03:32:37.177 --> 03:32:40.147
FORECLOSURE. UNDER SB 757, HE

03:32:40.214 --> 03:32:42.149
LIKELY WOULD HAVE LOST HIS HOME

03:32:42.216 --> 03:32:43.951
WITHOUT EVER STEPPING FOOT INTO

03:32:44.017 --> 03:32:48.355
COURT. SB 757 REMOVES THE LAST

03:32:48.422 --> 03:32:50.224
SAFEGUARD FOR VULNERABLE

03:32:50.290 --> 03:32:51.658
CALIFORNIANS, PUTTING THEM AT

03:32:51.725 --> 03:32:53.026
GREATER RISK OF UNJUST

03:32:53.093 --> 03:32:54.161
FORECLOSURE AND HOUSING

03:32:54.228 --> 03:32:55.863
INSTABILITY. FOR THESE REASONS,

03:32:55.929 --> 03:32:58.398
THE WESTERN CENTER OPPOSES. 757

03:32:58.465 --> 03:33:00.334
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IS THERE

03:33:00.400 --> 03:33:02.636
ANYONE ELSE HERE IN OPPOSITION

03:33:02.703 --> 03:33:08.208
TO SB 757? OKAY, WE'LL BRING IT

03:33:08.275 --> 03:33:10.277
BACK. IS THERE ANYBODY THERE?

03:33:10.344 --> 03:33:11.778
YEAH. COME ON UP. AND JUST NAME

03:33:11.845 --> 03:33:13.981
AN ORGANIZATION. GOOD MORNING,

03:33:14.047 --> 03:33:14.815
MARSHALL ARNWINE, ON BEHALF OF

03:33:14.882 --> 03:33:16.517
THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA ACTION

03:33:16.583 --> 03:33:17.818
AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION. THANK

03:33:17.885 --> 03:33:20.821
YOU. WE'LL BRING IT BACK.

03:33:20.888 --> 03:33:22.489
THERE'S A MOTION AND A SECOND.

03:33:22.556 --> 03:33:24.391
ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON

03:33:24.458 --> 03:33:25.826
THIS? THANK YOU, SENATOR, FOR

03:33:25.893 --> 03:33:26.593
BRINGING FORWARD THANK YOU FOR

03:33:26.660 --> 03:33:29.029
ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE

03:33:29.096 --> 03:33:30.464
AMENDMENTS THAT HELPED TO

03:33:30.531 --> 03:33:31.565
REDIRECT HOW FUNDS ARE SPENT, AS

03:33:31.632 --> 03:33:33.133
WELL AS EXEMPT LOW INCOME

03:33:33.200 --> 03:33:33.901
CALIFORNIANS FROM FINES. I HOPE

03:33:33.967 --> 03:33:35.435
YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH

03:33:35.502 --> 03:33:36.603
OPPOSITION IF THERE'S ANY

03:33:36.670 --> 03:33:38.372
MOVEMENT THAT CAN HAPPEN THERE.

03:33:38.438 --> 03:33:39.606
YOU KNOW, WE'LL SEE IF THAT CAN

03:33:39.673 --> 03:33:41.742
HAPPEN GOING FORWARD. WOULD YOU

03:33:41.808 --> 03:33:43.410
LIKE TO CLOSE? YES. FIRST, WITH

03:33:43.477 --> 03:33:45.012
PERMISSION TO RESPOND THROUGH

03:33:45.078 --> 03:33:47.447
THE CHAIR, I WANT TO STATE THAT

03:33:47.514 --> 03:33:48.815
ACTUALLY THE BILL STATES THAT

03:33:48.882 --> 03:33:51.385
THE PROPERTY OWNER WOULD HAVE 60

03:33:51.451 --> 03:33:52.719
DAYS AFTER GOING THROUGH THE

03:33:52.786 --> 03:33:55.055
FULL PROCESS. WE WENT AROUND AND

03:33:55.122 --> 03:33:56.356
SHOWED YOU THAT A CODE

03:33:56.423 --> 03:33:57.758
ENFORCEMENT IS NOT DONE

03:33:57.824 --> 03:33:59.359
SOMETHING OVERNIGHT. THIS IS

03:33:59.426 --> 03:34:01.195
SOMETHING THAT OCCURS OVER

03:34:01.261 --> 03:34:02.896
MONTHS. AND EVEN AFTER THAT, IF

03:34:02.963 --> 03:34:05.098
A PERSON'S TRASH WAS PICKED UP

03:34:05.165 --> 03:34:06.900
IN THE CITY, HAD TO PICK IT UP

03:34:06.967 --> 03:34:08.635
AND INCUR THE COST. THE

03:34:08.702 --> 03:34:11.538
INDIVIDUAL STILL HAS 60 DAYS TO

03:34:11.605 --> 03:34:13.774
RESPOND BEFORE A LIEN OR

03:34:13.840 --> 03:34:15.075
ANYTHING WOULD BE ASSESSED. AND

03:34:15.142 --> 03:34:17.644
THEN AGAIN, ONCE, EVEN IF A LIEN

03:34:17.711 --> 03:34:19.746
WAS ASSESSED, THE INDIVIDUAL

03:34:19.813 --> 03:34:20.681
WOULD STILL HAVE THEIR LEGAL

03:34:20.747 --> 03:34:22.916
RIGHT THROUGH LEGAL AID AND ANY

03:34:22.983 --> 03:34:24.985
OTHER MEANS TO BE ABLE TO BRING

03:34:25.052 --> 03:34:26.553
FORWARD. AND FINALLY, I HAVEN'T

03:34:26.620 --> 03:34:28.222
BEEN PRESENTED, TO MY KNOWLEDGE,

03:34:28.288 --> 03:34:29.690
ANY AMENDMENTS, AND WE'VE BEEN

03:34:29.756 --> 03:34:31.592
WORKING ON THIS BILL FOR

03:34:31.658 --> 03:34:33.360
APPROXIMATELY SEVEN MONTHS NOW.

03:34:33.427 --> 03:34:34.595
SO WE'VE WORKED QUITE

03:34:34.661 --> 03:34:35.862
DILIGENTLY, AND WE APPRECIATE

03:34:35.929 --> 03:34:39.032
YOU HELPING CITIES AND COUNTIES

03:34:39.099 --> 03:34:40.834
TO DEAL WITH THIS MOST DIFFICULT

03:34:40.901 --> 03:34:43.036
PROBLEM. IT'S NOT INTENDED FOR A

03:34:43.103 --> 03:34:44.938
53 YEAR OLD PERSON WHO'S BLIND.

03:34:45.005 --> 03:34:47.007
IT'S INTENDED FOR A PERSON WHO

03:34:47.074 --> 03:34:49.743
OWNS A VACANT LOT, AND TRASH HAS

03:34:49.810 --> 03:34:52.045
ACCUMULATED AND ACCUMULATED.

03:34:52.112 --> 03:34:54.848
RATS ARE RUNNING AROUND. PEOPLE

03:34:54.915 --> 03:34:56.717
CAN'T. KIDS CAN'T WALK TO SCHOOL

03:34:56.783 --> 03:34:59.186
NEXT TO THE PROPERTY. THAT'S

03:34:59.253 --> 03:35:01.221
WHERE THIS PROBLEM IS, AND WE'LL

03:35:01.288 --> 03:35:03.223
BE FOCUSED. I RESPECTFULLY ASK

03:35:03.290 --> 03:35:04.758
FOR YOUR VOTE AND THANK YOU FOR

03:35:04.825 --> 03:35:06.460
YOUR TIME TODAY. THANK YOU.

03:35:06.526 --> 03:35:08.395
MOTIONS DO PASS, AS AMENDED.

03:35:08.462 --> 03:35:10.764
CHOLERA. CHOLERA I. DIXON.

03:35:10.831 --> 03:35:15.035
DIXON. I KHN KHN. I BRIAN

03:35:15.102 --> 03:35:17.471
CONNOLLY. GARABEDIAN. GARABEDIAN

03:35:17.537 --> 03:35:20.841
I MACEDO. MACEDO I PACHECO.

03:35:20.907 --> 03:35:24.811
CHICO I PAPIN. PAPIN I SANCHEZ.

03:35:24.878 --> 03:35:27.648
SANCHEZ I STEFANI. ZEBRA. ZEBRA

03:35:27.714 --> 03:35:29.249
I. ALL RIGHT. THAT BILL IS OUT.

03:35:29.316 --> 03:35:31.785
THANK YOU. SENATOR. THANK YOU

03:35:31.852 --> 03:35:35.656
FOR YOUR TIME, SENATOR HURTADO.

03:35:35.722 --> 03:35:36.957
SENATOR HURTADO HAS TWO BILLS,

03:35:37.024 --> 03:35:41.028
SB 295, AS WELL AS SB 763. I

03:35:41.094 --> 03:35:42.729
ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR

03:35:42.796 --> 03:35:44.231
PATIENCE, SENATOR HURTADO, THIS

03:35:44.298 --> 03:35:46.767
MORNING. AND JUST FOR THE

03:35:46.833 --> 03:35:48.935
INFORMATION FOR THE PUBLIC AND

03:35:49.002 --> 03:35:50.771
EVERYONE ELSE, WE'RE LIKELY WE

03:35:50.837 --> 03:35:52.472
ARE GOING TO BREAK FOR CAUCUS, I

03:35:52.539 --> 03:35:54.041
DON'T KNOW, EXACT PROBABLY

03:35:54.107 --> 03:35:55.008
AROUND 12, 12, TEN AROUND THAT

03:35:55.075 --> 03:35:56.910
JUST DEPENDING ON WHERE WE ARE

03:35:56.977 --> 03:35:58.512
ON BILL PRESENTATIONS. AND SO

03:35:58.578 --> 03:35:59.112
WE'LL PROBABLY GO FOR ANOTHER

03:35:59.179 --> 03:36:01.014
HALF HOUR OR SO. AND WE DO HAVE

03:36:01.081 --> 03:36:03.283
A ROOM, ROOM 447 THIS AFTERNOON

03:36:03.350 --> 03:36:04.985
WHERE WE'LL RECONVENE AT 130. SO

03:36:05.052 --> 03:36:05.886
IF MEMBERS CAN TAKE THEIR

03:36:05.952 --> 03:36:08.555
BELONGINGS WITH THEM AND WE WILL

03:36:08.622 --> 03:36:09.089
RECONVENE THIS AFTERNOON.

03:36:09.156 --> 03:36:11.558
SENATOR HURTADO, THANK YOU, MR.

03:36:11.625 --> 03:36:14.594
CHAIR. I'M PROUD TO PRESENT SB

03:36:14.661 --> 03:36:16.630
2095, A BILL ROOTED IN REALITIES

03:36:16.697 --> 03:36:18.498
WE FACE BACK HOME IN THE CENTRAL

03:36:18.565 --> 03:36:20.600
VALLEY AND BEYOND, WHERE RISING

03:36:20.667 --> 03:36:22.302
PRICES AT THE GROCERY STORE, AT

03:36:22.369 --> 03:36:24.638
THE GAS PUMP AND IN RENT ARE NO

03:36:24.705 --> 03:36:25.739
LONGER JUST AN INCONVENIENCE.

03:36:25.806 --> 03:36:27.441
THEY'RE A THREAT TO WORKING

03:36:27.507 --> 03:36:29.676
FAMILIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES.

03:36:29.743 --> 03:36:31.244
LAST YEAR, I INTRODUCED A

03:36:31.311 --> 03:36:32.913
VERSION OF THIS BILL, AND, YOU

03:36:32.979 --> 03:36:34.781
KNOW, I COULDN'T GET IT OUT OF

03:36:34.848 --> 03:36:36.616
COMMITTEE. SO I'M REALLY EXTRA

03:36:36.683 --> 03:36:38.018
EXCITED THAT IT'S THIS BILL HAS

03:36:38.085 --> 03:36:39.753
MADE IT THIS FAR, AND I HOPE

03:36:39.820 --> 03:36:41.722
THAT IT MAKES IT ALL THE WAY AND

03:36:41.788 --> 03:36:44.791
GETS A SIGNATURE, BUT I SO I'LL

03:36:44.858 --> 03:36:45.792
SKIP TELLING YOU WHAT THE BILL

03:36:45.859 --> 03:36:48.128
REALLY DOES AND FOCUS ON, YOU

03:36:48.195 --> 03:36:49.262
KNOW WHY IT'S IMPORTANT? BECAUSE

03:36:49.329 --> 03:36:53.133
I THINK WE'RE PAST PAST

03:36:53.200 --> 03:36:54.468
EXPLAINING IT. NOW, I KNOW THAT

03:36:54.534 --> 03:36:55.602
WHEN I FIRST INTRODUCED IT,

03:36:55.669 --> 03:36:57.871
THERE WAS A LOT OF EXPLAINING

03:36:57.938 --> 03:36:58.538
AND EDUCATION THAT NEEDED TO GO

03:36:58.605 --> 03:37:00.674
INTO IT. BUT I WANT TO TALK

03:37:00.741 --> 03:37:04.311
ABOUT HOW WE GOT HERE AND WHY

03:37:04.378 --> 03:37:05.712
ALGORITHMIC PRICE FIXING ISN'T A

03:37:05.779 --> 03:37:07.547
RED ISSUE OR A BLUE ISSUE. IT'S

03:37:07.614 --> 03:37:09.383
AN AMERICAN ISSUE THAT WE ALL

03:37:09.449 --> 03:37:11.351
REALLY GOT TO WORK TOWARDS AND

03:37:11.418 --> 03:37:15.689
FIGURE SOLUTIONS OUT AND DO MORE

03:37:15.756 --> 03:37:18.592
ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT, BECAUSE

03:37:18.658 --> 03:37:19.659
ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT, WE'RE

03:37:19.726 --> 03:37:22.162
TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT IS

03:37:22.229 --> 03:37:24.631
CORE TO A FREE AND FAIR ECONOMY,

03:37:24.698 --> 03:37:26.600
SOMETHING BOTH REPUBLICANS AND

03:37:26.666 --> 03:37:28.001
DEMOCRATS HAVE RECOGNIZED THAT

03:37:28.068 --> 03:37:29.903
WHEN CORPORATE POWER GOES TOO

03:37:29.970 --> 03:37:32.005
FAR, AND HISTORY SHOWS THAT

03:37:32.072 --> 03:37:33.407
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS HAVE

03:37:33.473 --> 03:37:35.509
COME TOGETHER ON THIS ISSUE. SO

03:37:35.575 --> 03:37:37.210
THIS IS WHY THIS MEASURE IS

03:37:37.277 --> 03:37:39.646
REALLY IMPORTANT. BUT I WANT TO

03:37:39.713 --> 03:37:42.783
MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE ALL

03:37:42.849 --> 03:37:44.151
UNDERSTAND THAT, THAT TODAY'S

03:37:44.217 --> 03:37:46.286
CHALLENGE IS CLEAR. ALGORITHMS

03:37:46.353 --> 03:37:47.821
ARE NO LONGER JUST TOOLS. THEY

03:37:47.888 --> 03:37:49.556
ARE DECISION MAKERS. THEY

03:37:49.623 --> 03:37:50.924
INCREASINGLY DETERMINE WHAT

03:37:50.991 --> 03:37:53.160
CALIFORNIANS PAY FOR EVERYDAY

03:37:53.226 --> 03:37:57.497
NECESSITIES. AND THEN

03:37:57.564 --> 03:37:58.999
ALGORITHMIC PRICING TOOLS NOW

03:37:59.065 --> 03:38:00.400
ALLOW BUSINESSES TO COORDINATE

03:38:00.467 --> 03:38:01.835
PRICES COVERTLY, OFTEN THROUGH

03:38:01.902 --> 03:38:03.937
THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE. SOME

03:38:04.004 --> 03:38:04.971
PROVIDERS EVEN PRESSURE

03:38:05.038 --> 03:38:06.873
INDEPENDENT BUSINESSES TO

03:38:06.940 --> 03:38:08.675
SURRENDER PRICING CONTROL IN

03:38:08.742 --> 03:38:10.410
EXCHANGE FOR INCENTIVES LIKE

03:38:10.477 --> 03:38:12.512
PROMOTIONS OR MARKET RESEARCH,

03:38:12.579 --> 03:38:13.713
MAKING IT HARDER FOR THEM TO

03:38:13.780 --> 03:38:16.516
WALK AWAY. DESPITE THE CLEAR

03:38:16.583 --> 03:38:18.084
ILLEGALITY OF THIS BEHAVIOR,

03:38:18.151 --> 03:38:20.020
ENFORCEMENT REMAINS DIFFICULT TO

03:38:20.086 --> 03:38:20.887
PROSECUTE. THE BAR TO BRING A

03:38:20.954 --> 03:38:22.756
CASE IS EXTREMELY HIGH, OFTEN

03:38:22.823 --> 03:38:24.958
REQUIRING LENGTHY AND EXPENSIVE

03:38:25.025 --> 03:38:26.293
LITIGATION, ALL WHILE CONSUMERS

03:38:26.359 --> 03:38:28.495
CONTINUE TO PAY THE PRICE. I DO

03:38:28.562 --> 03:38:29.863
WANT TO BE CLEAR AND SAY THAT

03:38:29.930 --> 03:38:31.698
THIS BILL DOES DOESN'T BAN

03:38:31.765 --> 03:38:33.233
ALGORITHMS, IT BANS ABUSE, IT

03:38:33.300 --> 03:38:34.901
DOESN'T CRIMINALIZE INNOVATION.

03:38:34.968 --> 03:38:36.436
AND YOU ALSO MAY HEAR THAT

03:38:36.503 --> 03:38:38.638
PRICING ALGORITHMS, ALGORITHMS

03:38:38.705 --> 03:38:41.208
AREN'T INHERENTLY HARMFUL.

03:38:41.274 --> 03:38:42.542
THAT'S TRUE. JUST LIKE

03:38:42.609 --> 03:38:44.277
SPREADSHEETS OR PHONES AREN'T

03:38:44.344 --> 03:38:45.378
HARMFUL. BUT WHEN THESE TOOLS

03:38:45.445 --> 03:38:46.813
ARE TRAINED ON COMPETITORS

03:38:46.880 --> 03:38:48.315
SECRETS, THEY STOP SERVING

03:38:48.381 --> 03:38:49.683
CONSUMERS AND START RIGGING THE

03:38:49.749 --> 03:38:53.053
MARKET. SO WITH ME TODAY, I HAVE

03:38:53.119 --> 03:38:55.555
HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB

03:38:55.622 --> 03:38:57.290
295. JONATHAN EISENBERG, DEPUTY

03:38:57.357 --> 03:38:59.426
GENERAL COUNSEL TO GENERAL

03:38:59.493 --> 03:39:01.895
COUNSEL FOR LITIGATION OF THE

03:39:01.962 --> 03:39:03.063
AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION.

03:39:03.129 --> 03:39:06.733
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IS THE MIC

03:39:06.800 --> 03:39:09.603
ON AND CAN I BE HEARD? YEAH, I

03:39:09.669 --> 03:39:12.372
THINK WE KEEP IT CLOSE TO YOU.

03:39:12.439 --> 03:39:16.776
SHOULD BE FINE. I JUST WANT TO

03:39:16.843 --> 03:39:18.144
EMPHASIZE THAT THIS BILL, AS

03:39:18.211 --> 03:39:19.513
WELL AS THE OTHERS THAT ARE

03:39:19.579 --> 03:39:21.414
SIMILAR, ARE NOT RADICAL BILLS

03:39:21.481 --> 03:39:24.251
IN ANY WAY. THEY ARE

03:39:24.317 --> 03:39:26.353
IMPLEMENTING ONE OF THE IDEAS OF

03:39:26.419 --> 03:39:27.754
ADAM SMITH, WHO IS WIDELY SEEN

03:39:27.821 --> 03:39:29.990
AS THE FOUNDER OF FREE MARKET

03:39:30.056 --> 03:39:32.192
ECONOMICS. HE HAS A FAMOUS QUOTE

03:39:32.259 --> 03:39:34.494
PEOPLE OF THE SAME TRADE SELDOM

03:39:34.561 --> 03:39:36.296
MEET TOGETHER, EVEN FOR

03:39:36.363 --> 03:39:38.665
MERRIMENT AND DIVERSION. BUT THE

03:39:38.732 --> 03:39:40.066
CONVERSATION ENDS IN A

03:39:40.133 --> 03:39:41.868
CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE PUBLIC OR

03:39:41.935 --> 03:39:44.504
IN SOME CONTRIVANCE TO RAISE

03:39:44.571 --> 03:39:47.607
PRICES. ALGORITHMIC PRICING

03:39:47.674 --> 03:39:49.509
SOFTWARE IS JUST THE LATEST

03:39:49.576 --> 03:39:52.312
MEANS THAT BUSINESSES MAY USE TO

03:39:52.379 --> 03:39:54.447
ACCOMPLISH THIS END. THAT IS

03:39:54.514 --> 03:39:56.983
AGAINST THE PUBLIC INTEREST. I

03:39:57.050 --> 03:39:58.718
ALSO WANTED TO EMPHASIZE THAT

03:39:58.785 --> 03:40:01.321
THE US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE,

03:40:01.388 --> 03:40:04.524
UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP, HAS

03:40:04.591 --> 03:40:06.426
ISSUED STATEMENTS OF INTEREST IN

03:40:06.493 --> 03:40:08.495
SUPPORT OF THE PLAINTIFFS IN

03:40:08.562 --> 03:40:09.763
SOME OF THESE CASES THAT ARE

03:40:09.829 --> 03:40:11.865
GOING AFTER PRICE FIXING UNDER

03:40:11.932 --> 03:40:13.567
FEDERAL ANTITRUST LAW. SO BACK

03:40:13.633 --> 03:40:16.670
IN MARCH, IN THE MULTIDISTRICT

03:40:16.736 --> 03:40:18.572
LITIGATION ON IN RE MULTIPLIER

03:40:18.638 --> 03:40:20.740
HEALTH INSURANCE INSURER

03:40:20.807 --> 03:40:22.576
PROVIDER LITIGATION, THAT'S A

03:40:22.642 --> 03:40:26.112
LONG NAME THERE US DOJ

03:40:26.179 --> 03:40:27.480
INTERVENED WITH A STATEMENT OF

03:40:27.547 --> 03:40:29.316
INTEREST IN SUPPORT OF THE

03:40:29.382 --> 03:40:35.155
PLAINTIFF. THE BILL WILL NOT

03:40:35.221 --> 03:40:38.592
CRIMINALIZE OR PENALIZE A PERSON

03:40:38.658 --> 03:40:41.227
SUCH AS A SMALL LANDLORD. IN THE

03:40:41.294 --> 03:40:42.596
EXAMPLE THAT MISS DIXON HAD,

03:40:42.662 --> 03:40:44.531
THAT THE PERSON GOES ON ZILLOW

03:40:44.598 --> 03:40:47.000
TO SEE WHAT PRICES ARE. THAT'S

03:40:47.067 --> 03:40:48.768
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION.

03:40:48.835 --> 03:40:51.504
IT WOULD NOT BE THE NONPUBLIC

03:40:51.571 --> 03:40:52.205
INFORMATION THAT THE SOFTWARE

03:40:52.272 --> 03:40:55.976
HAS TO USE FOR SOMEONE TO BE

03:40:56.042 --> 03:40:57.444
PENALIZED. AND THEN ON TOP OF

03:40:57.510 --> 03:41:00.046
THAT, THIS LAW HAS A KNOWS OR

03:41:00.113 --> 03:41:02.515
SHOULD HAVE KNOWN PROVISION. SO

03:41:02.582 --> 03:41:05.352
THIS LAW IS WELL THE BILL.

03:41:05.418 --> 03:41:07.020
PARDON ME, I HOPE IT BECOMES A

03:41:07.087 --> 03:41:09.623
LAW. THE BILL IS WELL TAILORED

03:41:09.689 --> 03:41:11.157
TO ADDRESS THE PERNICIOUS

03:41:11.224 --> 03:41:13.994
CONDUCT AND NOT TO ADDRESS

03:41:14.060 --> 03:41:15.629
CONDUCT THAT IS PRO-COMPETITIVE

03:41:15.695 --> 03:41:18.999

03:41:19.065 --> 03:41:21.801

03:41:21.868 --> 03:41:24.771

RIVAS CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF

03:42:59.165 --> 03:43:01.134
COMMERCE I HAD TWO OF MY BILLS

03:43:01.201 --> 03:43:02.168
MIXED UP. APOLOGIES TO THE

03:43:02.235 --> 03:43:04.037
AUTHOR AND WITNESS FOR DELAY AS

03:43:04.104 --> 03:43:05.739
WELL. IN LIGHT OF THE 5 P.M.

03:43:05.805 --> 03:43:06.840
COMMENT THE CHAIR MADE, I'LL TRY

03:43:06.906 --> 03:43:09.609
TO BE AS BRIEF AS I CAN. I THINK

03:43:09.676 --> 03:43:11.411
THE AUTHOR COVERED A COUPLE OF

03:43:11.478 --> 03:43:12.512
POINTS THAT I WOULD ALSO

03:43:12.579 --> 03:43:14.047
EMPHASIZE. WE WOULD COMPLETELY

03:43:14.114 --> 03:43:15.115
AGREE PRICE COLLUSION IS ALREADY

03:43:15.181 --> 03:43:17.517
ILLEGAL UNDER EXISTING LAW. AND

03:43:17.584 --> 03:43:19.052
TO BE CLEAR, I DO NOT OPPOSE

03:43:19.119 --> 03:43:21.087
THAT. ANY SUPPORT FOR THAT. OUR

03:43:21.154 --> 03:43:22.722
CONCERN REALLY FOCUSES ON

03:43:22.789 --> 03:43:24.390
WHETHER THE BREADTH OF THESE

03:43:24.457 --> 03:43:25.759
DEFINITIONS CREATES ISSUES FOR

03:43:25.825 --> 03:43:28.328
NON COLLUSION, USE OF HELPFUL

03:43:28.394 --> 03:43:31.765
ALGORITHMS. AND TO THE POINT

03:43:31.831 --> 03:43:33.767
MADE, I THINK BRIEFLY, YOU KNOW,

03:43:33.833 --> 03:43:34.868
COLLUSION PROSECUTIONS ARE ON A

03:43:34.934 --> 03:43:35.902
COLLUSION ARE ACTIVELY HAPPENING

03:43:35.969 --> 03:43:37.737
TODAY. AND WE DO NOT HAVE ANY

03:43:37.804 --> 03:43:39.539
CONCERN WITH THAT. BUT WE ARE

03:43:39.606 --> 03:43:41.040
CONCERNED ON THE COLLATERAL

03:43:41.107 --> 03:43:41.808
DAMAGE AROUND THIS BILL. ALSO

03:43:41.875 --> 03:43:42.909
WANT TO APPRECIATE SOME OF THE

03:43:42.976 --> 03:43:43.910
NARROWING AMENDMENTS OVER THE

03:43:43.977 --> 03:43:45.912
LAST COUPLE OF DAYS, TOUCHING ON

03:43:45.979 --> 03:43:47.080
THE COMPETITIVELY SENSITIVE DATA

03:43:47.147 --> 03:43:47.847
DEFINITION. APPRECIATE THOSE

03:43:47.914 --> 03:43:49.549
CHANGES. TWO NOTABLE CONCERNS

03:43:49.616 --> 03:43:51.651
GOING FORWARD. FIRST IS THAT WE

03:43:51.718 --> 03:43:53.186
VIEW THESE AMENDMENTS AS

03:43:53.253 --> 03:43:54.621
WEAKENING THE ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE

03:43:54.687 --> 03:43:55.655
STANDARD REQUIRED IN SENATE

03:43:55.722 --> 03:43:56.656
JUDICI, AND REPLACING IT WITH

03:43:56.723 --> 03:43:57.857
THE NEWER SHOULD HAVE KNOWN,

03:43:57.924 --> 03:43:59.692
WHICH WAS MENTIONED, I THINK, BY

03:43:59.759 --> 03:44:01.127
THE WITNESS. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE

03:44:01.194 --> 03:44:03.563
SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THAT AS A AS

03:44:03.630 --> 03:44:04.831
A LANGUAGE. AND THEN WE ALSO

03:44:04.898 --> 03:44:06.366
HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE BREADTH

03:44:06.432 --> 03:44:06.966
OF THE DEFINITION OF PRICING

03:44:07.033 --> 03:44:09.002
ALGORITHM. NOTABLY, I THINK THIS

03:44:09.068 --> 03:44:10.203
WAS MENTIONED IN A PREVIOUS BILL

03:44:10.270 --> 03:44:11.838
ON THIS TOPIC THAT IT'S BROAD

03:44:11.905 --> 03:44:13.173
ENOUGH. I MAY HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN

03:44:13.239 --> 03:44:14.474
YOU, AND MY APOLOGIES. IT'S

03:44:14.541 --> 03:44:15.675
BROAD ENOUGH TO INCLUDE THINGS

03:44:15.742 --> 03:44:17.477
LIKE SPREADSHEETS OR OTHER, KIND

03:44:17.544 --> 03:44:19.813
OF LESS WHAT I WOULD SAY LESS

03:44:19.879 --> 03:44:20.413
THE NON PROBLEMATIC USES THAT

03:44:20.480 --> 03:44:22.448
ARE JUST BASIC MATH. SO WE ARE

03:44:22.515 --> 03:44:23.750
REVIEWING THE RECENT AMENDMENTS

03:44:23.817 --> 03:44:25.618
AND MAY CHANGE POSITIONS AS THAT

03:44:25.685 --> 03:44:26.920
GOES, BUT AT THIS TIME REMAIN

03:44:26.986 --> 03:44:28.755
OPPOSED TO SB 295 AS A COST

03:44:28.822 --> 03:44:29.689
DRIVER. THANK YOU. AND AGAIN

03:44:29.756 --> 03:44:31.057
APOLOGIES FOR MY DELAY. THANK

03:44:31.124 --> 03:44:33.259
YOU. I WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE

03:44:33.326 --> 03:44:33.960
COMMITTEE. ANY QUESTIONS

03:44:34.027 --> 03:44:36.629
COMMENTS, MOTIONS, ASSEMBLY

03:44:36.696 --> 03:44:38.965
MEMBERS OF BR. AS I MENTIONED IN

03:44:39.032 --> 03:44:41.067
THE PRIOR HEARING, I'M GOING TO

03:44:41.134 --> 03:44:42.135
SUPPORT ALL OF THESE BILLS

03:44:42.202 --> 03:44:43.570
TODAY. I THINK, YOU KNOW, IT'S

03:44:43.636 --> 03:44:46.072
IMPORTANT THAT WE, YOU KNOW,

03:44:46.139 --> 03:44:47.540
FIGHT AGAINST COLLUSION,

03:44:47.607 --> 03:44:49.742
ESPECIALLY, YOU KNOW,

03:44:49.809 --> 03:44:50.810
APPLICATIONS THAT ARE ACTUALLY

03:44:50.877 --> 03:44:52.545
HARMING CONSUMERS AND RAISING

03:44:52.612 --> 03:44:54.647
RENTS. AND THAT IS, I THINK, A

03:44:54.714 --> 03:44:56.850
REALLY IMPORTANT GOAL. SO WE'LL

03:44:56.916 --> 03:44:59.352
BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. I

03:44:59.419 --> 03:45:01.621
AS I SAID WITH THE OTHERS, I

03:45:01.688 --> 03:45:03.790
THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT

03:45:03.857 --> 03:45:06.326
THESE BILLS GET SOMEHOW NARROWED

03:45:06.392 --> 03:45:10.597
DOWN AND PUT INTO CONSOLIDATED,

03:45:10.663 --> 03:45:12.065
BECAUSE I THINK WITH ALL OF

03:45:12.131 --> 03:45:14.734
THEM, IT'S NOT THE GOAL. THAT IS

03:45:14.801 --> 03:45:16.069
THE THAT IS THE PROBLEM, WHICH I

03:45:16.135 --> 03:45:17.503
THINK EVERYONE SUPPORTS. IT'S

03:45:17.570 --> 03:45:19.572
ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE DON'T

03:45:19.639 --> 03:45:21.140
HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.

03:45:21.207 --> 03:45:23.676
SO, YOU KNOW, WE DON'T WANT, YOU

03:45:23.743 --> 03:45:26.412
KNOW, APARTMENTS.COM TO NOT BE

03:45:26.479 --> 03:45:27.146
AVAILABLE. I MEAN, THAT'S

03:45:27.213 --> 03:45:29.616
SOMETHING THAT, YOU KNOW, THAT

03:45:29.682 --> 03:45:33.720
RENTERS USE TO, TO, YOU KNOW,

03:45:33.786 --> 03:45:34.754
OBTAIN AN APARTMENT AND

03:45:34.821 --> 03:45:35.755
UNDERSTAND SORT OF WHERE THEY'RE

03:45:35.822 --> 03:45:37.590
GOING TO GO. WE ALL LANDLORDS

03:45:37.657 --> 03:45:39.692
ALSO USE IT AS WELL. SO I THINK,

03:45:39.759 --> 03:45:41.561
YOU KNOW, THE DEFINITIONS ARE

03:45:41.628 --> 03:45:43.363
REALLY IMPORTANT. AND I WOULD

03:45:43.429 --> 03:45:44.831
ENCOURAGE ALL OF THE FOLKS IN

03:45:44.898 --> 03:45:46.900
THIS SPACE TO TRY TO CONSOLIDATE

03:45:46.966 --> 03:45:49.202
THESE THINGS AND WORK TOGETHER,

03:45:49.269 --> 03:45:51.304
BECAUSE THE DEFINITIONS ARE

03:45:51.371 --> 03:45:51.938
IMPORTANT. AND I GUESS THE OTHER

03:45:52.005 --> 03:45:54.841
THING I'D SAY IS, YOU KNOW, WHEN

03:45:54.908 --> 03:45:58.511
WHATEVER BILL COMES BACK TO THE

03:45:58.578 --> 03:45:59.879
FLOOR, I'M GOING TO BE LOOKING

03:45:59.946 --> 03:46:02.849
AT, IS THIS SOMETHING THAT IS

03:46:02.916 --> 03:46:04.217
HOLDING THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

03:46:04.284 --> 03:46:06.052
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COLLUSION

03:46:06.119 --> 03:46:07.420
ACCOUNTABLE? I DON'T WANT

03:46:07.487 --> 03:46:09.355
SOMEONE WHO IS EVEN IN A, YOU

03:46:09.422 --> 03:46:11.491
KNOW, A RENTER AND APARTMENT

03:46:11.557 --> 03:46:12.992
OWNER WHO COMES ON TO A WEBSITE

03:46:13.059 --> 03:46:15.094
AND FILLS OUT A FORM TO BE

03:46:15.161 --> 03:46:17.931
SUBJECT TO PENALTIES, BECAUSE

03:46:17.997 --> 03:46:19.766
THAT'S THE WAY THE WEBSITE

03:46:19.832 --> 03:46:21.501
OPERATES. IT'S, YOU KNOW, IT'S

03:46:21.567 --> 03:46:22.902
REALLY SHOULD BE THE FOLKS THAT

03:46:22.969 --> 03:46:24.370
ARE, YOU KNOW, OFFERING THESE

03:46:24.437 --> 03:46:26.172
THINGS UP, DISTRIBUTING THE

03:46:26.239 --> 03:46:27.607
WEBSITE. WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING

03:46:27.674 --> 03:46:28.775
ON THE FOLKS THAT ARE

03:46:28.841 --> 03:46:30.643
RESPONSIBLE FOR, YOU KNOW, WHAT

03:46:30.710 --> 03:46:32.712
WE'RE TRYING TO PREVENT. AND SO

03:46:32.779 --> 03:46:34.280
I JUST WOULD ASK THAT YOU FOCUS

03:46:34.347 --> 03:46:36.049
ON THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD.

03:46:36.115 --> 03:46:39.085
THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER

03:46:39.152 --> 03:46:41.621
PACHECO. THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR

03:46:41.688 --> 03:46:43.423
FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD.

03:46:43.489 --> 03:46:44.891
I CAN TELL THERE'S AMENDMENTS

03:46:44.958 --> 03:46:47.427
THAT ARE BEING TAKEN TO POSSIBLY

03:46:47.493 --> 03:46:49.362
GET SOME OF OR MAYBE ALL OF

03:46:49.429 --> 03:46:50.730
OPPOSITION TO NEUTRAL. SO I WILL

03:46:50.797 --> 03:46:52.198
BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY,

03:46:52.265 --> 03:46:53.766
AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE

03:46:53.833 --> 03:46:55.568
FINAL OUTCOME. THANK YOU. IS

03:46:55.635 --> 03:46:58.538
THERE A MOTION I MOVE? WE HAVE A

03:46:58.604 --> 03:47:00.707
MOTION AND A SECOND. ANY OTHER

03:47:00.773 --> 03:47:01.607
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS? I KNOW WE

03:47:01.674 --> 03:47:03.676
ALREADY HAD A BILL IN THIS

03:47:03.743 --> 03:47:05.445
SPACE. I THINK PEOPLE MADE A LOT

03:47:05.511 --> 03:47:07.714
OF COMMENTS AT THAT TIME, AND I

03:47:07.780 --> 03:47:09.215
WOULD JUST REITERATE ASSEMBLY

03:47:09.282 --> 03:47:09.816
MEMBER BURR'S COMMENTS THAT,

03:47:09.882 --> 03:47:10.817
LOOK, WE HAVE THREE SENATE BILLS

03:47:10.883 --> 03:47:13.720
IN THE SAME SPACE. THE JUDICIARY

03:47:13.786 --> 03:47:14.287
COMMITTEE, THE PRIVACY

03:47:14.354 --> 03:47:15.521
COMMITTEE, ARE DOING THE BEST

03:47:15.588 --> 03:47:17.590
JOB THEY CAN TO TRY TO CREATE

03:47:17.657 --> 03:47:18.725
SOME CONSISTENCY, BUT I THINK

03:47:18.791 --> 03:47:19.659
THAT THEY ALL DESERVE THE RIGHT

03:47:19.726 --> 03:47:21.928
TO BE HEARD. AND AT SOME POINT,

03:47:21.995 --> 03:47:23.763
THOUGH, I THINK IT WILL BE

03:47:23.830 --> 03:47:24.731
PRODUCTIVE IF FOLKS GET TOGETHER

03:47:24.797 --> 03:47:25.698
AND SEE HOW THEY CAN GET ONE

03:47:25.765 --> 03:47:27.800
THING MOVING FORWARD, BECAUSE I

03:47:27.867 --> 03:47:28.935
THINK THAT IT'S PROBABLY

03:47:29.002 --> 03:47:29.635
UNLIKELY THAT ALL THREE ARE

03:47:29.702 --> 03:47:31.704
GOING TO EVENTUALLY GET

03:47:31.771 --> 03:47:32.338
CHAPTERS. SO I THINK IT'S MORE

03:47:32.405 --> 03:47:33.806
PRODUCTIVE, INCLUDING WORKING

03:47:33.873 --> 03:47:34.407
WITH THE OPPOSITION, BECAUSE I

03:47:34.474 --> 03:47:35.708
THINK IT'S PROBABLY CONFUSING

03:47:35.775 --> 03:47:36.743
FOR OPPOSITION ALSO TO HAVE

03:47:36.809 --> 03:47:37.477
THREE SEPARATE CONVERSATIONS

03:47:37.543 --> 03:47:38.578
WITH THREE SEPARATE AUTHORS AS

03:47:38.644 --> 03:47:40.747
WELL. SO I THINK IT MIGHT BE

03:47:40.813 --> 03:47:41.647
BENEFICIAL TO ALL OF US BEFORE

03:47:41.714 --> 03:47:43.950
THEY GET TO THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR

03:47:44.017 --> 03:47:45.018
TO START HAVING SOME OF THOSE

03:47:45.084 --> 03:47:46.152
CONVERSATIONS, BUT THAT WOULD

03:47:46.219 --> 03:47:48.054
YOU LIKE TO CLOSE? I THANK YOU,

03:47:48.121 --> 03:47:48.688
AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN

03:47:48.755 --> 03:47:50.757
AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MOTIONS DO

03:47:50.823 --> 03:47:51.724
PASS TO PRIVACY AND CONSUMER

03:47:51.791 --> 03:47:53.126
PROTECTION COMMITTEE. CHOLERA A

03:47:53.192 --> 03:47:55.294
CHOLERA I DIXON. DIXON NÓ

03:47:55.361 --> 03:47:59.665
BAUER-KAHAN BRIAN CONNOLLY.

03:47:59.732 --> 03:48:02.468
GARABEDIAN. GARABEDIAN I MACEDO.

03:48:02.535 --> 03:48:04.737
MACEDO NØ. PACHECO I PACHECO I

03:48:04.804 --> 03:48:07.907
PAPIN. PAPIN I SANCHEZ. SANCHEZ.

03:48:07.974 --> 03:48:10.410
NO. STEPHANIE. ZEBRA. ZEBRA I.

03:48:10.476 --> 03:48:12.245
WE WILL PLACE THAT ON CALL.

03:48:12.311 --> 03:48:14.814
THANK YOU. AND THEN ITEM 15 IS

03:48:14.881 --> 03:48:24.690
SB 763. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

03:48:24.757 --> 03:48:28.161
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. MEMBERS SB

03:48:28.227 --> 03:48:29.262
SEVEN 663, WHICH INCREASES

03:48:29.328 --> 03:48:31.230
PENALTIES UNDER THE CARTWRIGHT

03:48:31.297 --> 03:48:32.865
ACT, OUR STATE'S PRIMARY

03:48:32.932 --> 03:48:36.803
ANTITRUST LAW. HAS NOT BEEN

03:48:36.869 --> 03:48:38.871
UPDATED IN DECADES. MARKET

03:48:38.938 --> 03:48:40.440
MANIPULATION, PRICE GOUGING,

03:48:40.506 --> 03:48:42.275
WIPING OUT LOCAL COMPETITION AND

03:48:42.341 --> 03:48:42.975
CHARGING WHATEVER YOU WANT

03:48:43.042 --> 03:48:44.544
BECAUSE THERE'S NOBODY LEFT TO

03:48:44.610 --> 03:48:46.512
COMPETE WITH. THAT'S THE REALITY

03:48:46.579 --> 03:48:50.650
WE LIVE IN. SB 763 UPDATES

03:48:50.716 --> 03:48:51.951
PENALTIES UNDER THE CARTWRIGHT

03:48:52.018 --> 03:48:53.352
ACT, SO THEY ACTUALLY MEAN

03:48:53.419 --> 03:48:55.221
SOMETHING IN TODAY'S ECONOMIC

03:48:55.288 --> 03:48:57.490
REALITY. RIGHT NOW, $1 BILLION

03:48:57.557 --> 03:48:58.724
COMPANY CAN BREAK THE LAW, WIPE

03:48:58.791 --> 03:49:00.960
OUT COMPETITION AND JUST PAY A

03:49:01.027 --> 03:49:02.728
FINE THAT THEY CONSIDER A SIMPLE

03:49:02.795 --> 03:49:04.897
COST OF DOING BUSINESS. WE'RE

03:49:04.964 --> 03:49:06.833
NOT PROPOSING ANYTHING EXTREME

03:49:06.899 --> 03:49:08.434
HERE. WE'RE SIMPLY ENSURING THAT

03:49:08.501 --> 03:49:10.770
VIOLATING OUR ANTITRUST LAWS

03:49:10.837 --> 03:49:13.272
COMES WITH REAL, ENFORCEABLE

03:49:13.339 --> 03:49:15.074
CONSEQUENCES. CONSEQUENCES BIG

03:49:15.141 --> 03:49:16.809
ENOUGH TO MAKE DOMINANT FIRMS

03:49:16.876 --> 03:49:19.045
THINK TWICE BEFORE THEY RIG THE

03:49:19.112 --> 03:49:21.681
MARKET. SB 763 RAISES THE STAKES

03:49:21.747 --> 03:49:24.050
NOT TO PUNISH, BUT TO DETER,

03:49:24.117 --> 03:49:26.486
BECAUSE WHEN THERE'S NO REAL

03:49:26.552 --> 03:49:29.422
PENALTY, THERE'S NO REAL REASON

03:49:29.489 --> 03:49:31.557
TO STOP. AND WHEN BAD ACTORS

03:49:31.624 --> 03:49:33.559
DON'T STOP, WE ALL PAY THE PRICE

03:49:33.626 --> 03:49:35.628
AT THE GROCERY STORE, AT THE GAS

03:49:35.695 --> 03:49:37.797
PUMP AND OUR RENT, AND IN THE

03:49:37.864 --> 03:49:38.598
BUSINESSES THAT NEVER HAD A FAIR

03:49:38.664 --> 03:49:40.399
SHOT TO BEGIN WITH. THIS BILL

03:49:40.466 --> 03:49:41.934
ISN'T JUST ABOUT TAKING ON

03:49:42.001 --> 03:49:43.536
MONOPOLIES OR GLOBAL GIANTS.

03:49:43.603 --> 03:49:45.338
IT'S ABOUT STOPPING BIG PLAYERS

03:49:45.404 --> 03:49:48.541
WHO USE POWER, NOT INNOVATION,

03:49:48.608 --> 03:49:50.610
TO LOCK OTHERS OUT. WHETHER IT'S

03:49:50.676 --> 03:49:52.478
A CORPORATE CHAIN PUSHING OUR

03:49:52.545 --> 03:49:54.947
LOCAL STORES OR A DOMINANT

03:49:55.014 --> 03:49:57.049
SUPPLIER SETTING PRICES IN A

03:49:57.116 --> 03:49:58.618
CLOSED MARKET, THE STORY IS THE

03:49:58.684 --> 03:50:00.753
SAME RIG THE SYSTEM, BLOCK THE

03:50:00.820 --> 03:50:02.188
COMPETITION AND MAKE EVERYONE

03:50:02.255 --> 03:50:04.657
ELSE PAY. SB 763 IS ABOUT

03:50:04.724 --> 03:50:06.425
STANDING UP FOR THE PEOPLE OF

03:50:06.492 --> 03:50:08.327
CALIFORNIA. THE FAMILY FARMERS

03:50:08.394 --> 03:50:10.196
OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY, THE

03:50:10.263 --> 03:50:12.165
CORNER STORE OWNER, THE WORKING

03:50:12.231 --> 03:50:13.900
PARENT JUST TRYING TO KEEP FOOD

03:50:13.966 --> 03:50:15.601
ON THE TABLE. IT'S ABOUT

03:50:15.668 --> 03:50:17.270
ENSURING THAT OUR LAWS PROTECT

03:50:17.336 --> 03:50:19.405
PROTECTS THE MANY, NOT JUST THE

03:50:19.472 --> 03:50:22.241
MIGHTY. CALIFORNIANS DESERVE A

03:50:22.308 --> 03:50:24.577
COMPETITIVE ECONOMY THAT WORKS

03:50:24.644 --> 03:50:25.878
FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST THOSE WHO

03:50:25.945 --> 03:50:28.147
CAN AFFORD TO RIG THE RULES. AND

03:50:28.214 --> 03:50:29.849
LET'S STAND WITH THE PEOPLE WHO

03:50:29.916 --> 03:50:31.350
PLAY FAIR. LET'S RESTORE THE

03:50:31.417 --> 03:50:32.785
INTEGRITY OF OUR MARKETS. AND

03:50:32.852 --> 03:50:34.954
LET'S FINALLY SAY IN CALIFORNIA,

03:50:35.021 --> 03:50:35.988
IF YOU CHEAT THE SYSTEM, YOU

03:50:36.055 --> 03:50:38.391
JUST DON'T PAY A FEE. YOU FACE

03:50:38.457 --> 03:50:40.960
REAL CONSEQUENCES. THANK YOU.

03:50:41.027 --> 03:50:43.429
AND WITH THAT, WITH ME TODAY, I

03:50:43.496 --> 03:50:44.163
HAVE REPRESENTED THE DEPARTMENT

03:50:44.230 --> 03:50:44.864
OF JUSTICE. SPONSORS OF THE BILL

03:50:44.931 --> 03:50:47.466
IS ANTHONY LIU, DEPUTY ATTORNEY

03:50:47.533 --> 03:50:48.534
GENERAL AND OFFICE OF

03:50:48.601 --> 03:50:51.170
LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS AND SENIOR

03:50:51.237 --> 03:50:52.605
ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL,

03:50:52.672 --> 03:50:53.706
ANTITRUST SECTION. PAULA

03:50:53.773 --> 03:50:55.107
BLIZZARD AVAILABLE FOR ANY

03:50:55.174 --> 03:50:56.809
TECHNICAL QUESTIONS AS WELL.

03:50:56.876 --> 03:50:59.378
IT'S AN HONOR TO HAVE THEM HERE

03:50:59.445 --> 03:51:00.947
AS WITNESSES FOR THIS MEASURE.

03:51:01.013 --> 03:51:04.250
THANK YOU, MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS

03:51:04.317 --> 03:51:06.018
ANTHONY LIU, DEPUTY AG FOR THE

03:51:06.085 --> 03:51:07.386
OFFICE OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

03:51:07.453 --> 03:51:08.521
FOR AG BONTA, THE SPONSOR OF

03:51:08.588 --> 03:51:10.957
THIS BILL. WE WANT TO THANK

03:51:11.023 --> 03:51:11.958
SENATOR HURTADO FOR LEADERSHIP

03:51:12.024 --> 03:51:13.993
AND AUTHORING THIS LEGISLATION

03:51:14.060 --> 03:51:15.628
TO UPDATE EXISTING ANTITRUST LAW

03:51:15.695 --> 03:51:17.463
AND STRENGTHEN PENALTIES AGAINST

03:51:17.530 --> 03:51:19.599
CORPORATE MISCONDUCT. YOU KNOW,

03:51:19.665 --> 03:51:21.100
AFTER OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS,

03:51:21.167 --> 03:51:23.169
THE GLOBAL ECONOMY HAS HAD AN

03:51:23.236 --> 03:51:24.604
ALARMING CONCENTRATION OF MARKET

03:51:24.670 --> 03:51:27.106
POWER WITH MONOPOLIES AND

03:51:27.173 --> 03:51:29.542
OLIGOPOLIES DOMINATING ENTIRE

03:51:29.609 --> 03:51:31.077
INDUSTRIES. AND DESPITE THIS

03:51:31.143 --> 03:51:32.578
GROWING THREAT, CALIFORNIA'S

03:51:32.645 --> 03:51:34.347
PENALTIES FOR ANTI-COMPETITIVE

03:51:34.413 --> 03:51:36.449
BEHAVIOR REMAIN WOEFULLY

03:51:36.515 --> 03:51:37.683
OUTDATED. THE CORPORATE FINES

03:51:37.750 --> 03:51:39.685
THAT ONCE SEEMED SUBSTANTIAL ARE

03:51:39.752 --> 03:51:41.454
NOW LITTLE MORE THAN THE COST OF

03:51:41.520 --> 03:51:42.855
DOING BUSINESS TO MULTIBILLION

03:51:42.922 --> 03:51:45.091
DOLLAR COMPANIES. SO THIS BILL,

03:51:45.157 --> 03:51:47.660
SB 763, WOULD ADD CIVIL

03:51:47.727 --> 03:51:49.295
PENALTIES OF UP TO $1 MILLION

03:51:49.362 --> 03:51:50.830
PER VIOLATION THAT COURTS CAN

03:51:50.896 --> 03:51:53.032
IMPOSE BASED ON FACTORS SUCH AS

03:51:53.099 --> 03:51:55.468
THE NATURE, SERIOUSNESS AND

03:51:55.534 --> 03:51:57.737
PERSISTENCE OF MISCONDUCT. AS

03:51:57.803 --> 03:51:59.238
NOTED ON PAGE SEVEN OF THE

03:51:59.305 --> 03:52:00.506
COMMITTEE'S THOROUGH ANALYSIS,

03:52:00.573 --> 03:52:03.009
THESE FACTORS CLOSELY MIRROR THE

03:52:03.075 --> 03:52:04.777
VERY FAMILIAR FACTORS CONSIDERED

03:52:04.844 --> 03:52:07.046
WHEN ASSESSING THE AMOUNT OF

03:52:07.113 --> 03:52:08.581
PENALTIES UNDER BOTH THE UCL AND

03:52:08.648 --> 03:52:11.417
THE FALSE ADVERTISING LAW.

03:52:11.484 --> 03:52:12.985
CALIFORNIA IS BEHIND MOST OTHER

03:52:13.052 --> 03:52:14.020
STATES IN TERMS OF NOT HAVING

03:52:14.086 --> 03:52:16.355
CIVIL PENALTIES FOR ANTITRUST

03:52:16.422 --> 03:52:17.423
VIOLATIONS. THIS BILL WOULD JOIN

03:52:17.490 --> 03:52:19.725
CALIFORNIA WITH 44 OTHER STATES

03:52:59.465 --> 03:53:01.000
BECAUSE IT IS UNCERTAIN HOW

03:53:13.379 --> 03:53:14.447

REMOVED THE COST DRIVER LABEL.

03:54:35.428 --> 03:54:36.762
HOWEVER, WE MUST REMAIN OPPOSED

03:54:36.829 --> 03:54:38.464
TO THE BILL. WE BELIEVE THAT THE

03:54:38.531 --> 03:54:40.099

THIS YEAR. OBVIOUSLY, THE CHAIR

03:54:51.377 --> 03:54:53.012
SERVED ON THAT COMMISSION FOR A

03:54:53.078 --> 03:54:54.380
LONG TIME, AND WE'RE EXPECTING

03:54:54.447 --> 03:54:56.315
LEGISLATION AS A RESULT OF THOSE

03:54:56.382 --> 03:54:57.716

03:54:57.783 --> 03:54:59.118
DRAMATICALLY EXPANDING THE

03:55:05.424 --> 03:55:06.091

AND THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME

03:55:32.651 --> 03:55:34.520
COURT'S VIEW THAT IT IS BROADER

03:55:34.587 --> 03:55:36.255

03:55:37.823 --> 03:55:39.191
THINK THAT THE CARTWRIGHT ACT

JUST NOTE THAT THE CRIMINAL

BILL HAD $100 MILLION CAP

03:57:01.707 --> 03:57:02.942

ELIGIBILITY FOR IN-STATE TUITION

03:59:32.191 --> 03:59:33.592

03:59:33.659 --> 03:59:34.927
THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS, AS

03:59:34.993 --> 03:59:36.261
LONG AS THEY MEET THE

03:59:36.328 --> 03:59:37.396
REQUIREMENTS ALREADY SET FORTH

03:59:37.463 --> 03:59:40.132
IN STATE LAW. LASTLY, A UNIFORM

IN HIGHER EDUCATION, AT 87,000

DEEPLY INVESTED IN THEIR

FROM IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES,

SUCH AS DETENTION OR

04:01:18.297 --> 04:01:19.731
DEPORTATION. GIVEN THE MOMENT

04:01:19.798 --> 04:01:21.767

DAY. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR.

04:04:01.259 --> 04:04:03.795
PLEASED TO PRESENT SB 351 TODAY.

04:04:03.862 --> 04:04:07.666
SB 351 IS A MODEST BILL THAT

04:04:07.733 --> 04:04:10.969
SEEKS TO ASSURE THAT WE HAVE

04:04:11.036 --> 04:04:12.004
APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTABILITY AND

04:04:12.070 --> 04:04:13.805
GUARDRAILS FOR PRIVATE EQUITY IN

04:04:13.872 --> 04:04:16.375
HEALTHCARE. SO THE BILL SIMPLY

04:04:16.441 --> 04:04:18.910
TAKES THE GUIDELINES THAT ARE

04:04:18.977 --> 04:04:20.712
PROMULGATED BY THE STATE, THE

04:04:20.779 --> 04:04:21.747
CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD, TO

04:04:21.813 --> 04:04:24.116
MAKE SURE THAT THE PRACTICE OF

04:04:24.182 --> 04:04:26.818
MEDICINE DOES NOT INFRINGE ON

04:04:26.885 --> 04:04:28.587
CLINICAL AND CLINICAL EXPERTISE

04:04:28.653 --> 04:04:29.888
THROUGH THE CORPORATE PRACTICE

04:04:29.955 --> 04:04:31.823
AND PUTS THOSE INTO STATUTE,

04:04:31.890 --> 04:04:33.692
ADDS ONE EXTRA PROVISION AROUND

04:04:33.759 --> 04:04:34.926
NON-COMPETE CLAUSES, WHICH HAS

04:04:34.993 --> 04:04:36.661
BEEN A MAJOR ISSUE BOTH IN

04:04:36.728 --> 04:04:37.696
CALIFORNIA AND NATIONWIDE, AND

04:04:37.763 --> 04:04:39.831
GIVES THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THE

04:04:39.898 --> 04:04:40.899
POWER TO ENFORCE. THAT'S ALL IT

04:04:40.966 --> 04:04:42.634
DOES. IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE

04:04:42.701 --> 04:04:43.735
STANDARDS FOR THE CORPORATE

04:04:43.802 --> 04:04:45.003
PRACTICE OF MEDICINE IN ANY WAY.

04:04:45.070 --> 04:04:47.339
WE WORK CLOSELY WITH WITH THE

04:04:47.406 --> 04:04:48.340
OPPOSITION ON THE BILL. AND I'M

04:04:48.407 --> 04:04:50.876
PLEASED THAT THAT WE HAVE

04:04:50.942 --> 04:04:51.943
REMOVED ABOUT HALF THE

04:04:52.010 --> 04:04:53.211
OPPOSITION. WE CONTINUE TO WORK

04:04:53.278 --> 04:04:55.113
WITH SOME OF THE PRIVATE EQUITY

04:04:55.180 --> 04:04:56.648
ORGANIZATIONS WHOSE CONCERN IS

04:04:56.715 --> 04:04:57.649
THAT WE ARE FOCUSING

04:04:57.716 --> 04:04:58.884
SPECIFICALLY ON THEM, AND THERE

04:04:58.950 --> 04:05:00.619
IS A REASON FOR THAT, AND THAT

04:05:00.685 --> 04:05:02.454
IS THAT PRIVATE EQUITY

04:05:02.521 --> 04:05:03.789
TRANSACTIONS ARE THE FASTEST

04:05:03.855 --> 04:05:06.358
GROWING BY FAR FOR CORPORATE

04:05:06.425 --> 04:05:08.894
FORM IN HEALTHCARE. WE'VE SEEN A

04:05:08.960 --> 04:05:10.362
FIVE FOLD INCREASE IN PRIVATE

04:05:10.429 --> 04:05:12.030
EQUITY HEALTHCARE TRANSACTIONS.

04:05:12.097 --> 04:05:13.532
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, THOSE

04:05:13.598 --> 04:05:15.300
TRANSACTIONS ARE VERY FAST. AND

04:05:15.367 --> 04:05:17.569
SO WHEREAS IN PRIVATE EQUITY

04:05:17.636 --> 04:05:19.137
TRANSACTIONS, IN THE DEVELOPMENT

04:05:19.204 --> 04:05:20.772
OF PHARMACEUTICALS, FOR EXAMPLE,

04:05:20.839 --> 04:05:23.308
THE WHOLE TIME FOR THOSE

04:05:23.375 --> 04:05:25.410
TRANSACTIONS ARE QUITE LONG. BUT

04:05:25.477 --> 04:05:27.379
IN MEDICAL AND DENTAL PRACTICES

04:05:27.446 --> 04:05:30.148
IN CALIFORNIA, THEY'RE VERY FAST

04:05:30.215 --> 04:05:31.950
USUALLY NOW LESS THAN TWO YEARS.

04:05:32.017 --> 04:05:34.219
AND SO THE NORMAL MECHANISMS FOR

04:05:34.286 --> 04:05:35.954
ACCOUNTABILITY, THE REGULATORY

04:05:36.021 --> 04:05:37.422
PROCESS, THE MEDICAL BOARD AND

04:05:37.489 --> 04:05:39.191
EVEN SORT OF REPUTATIONAL

04:05:39.257 --> 04:05:40.992
EFFECTS ARE NOT, ARE NOT

04:05:41.059 --> 04:05:42.828
EFFECTIVE. AND SO THIS BILL

04:05:42.894 --> 04:05:44.863
SIMPLY PLACES THE GUIDELINES

04:05:44.930 --> 04:05:46.164
INTO STATUTE, PROVIDES AN

04:05:46.231 --> 04:05:48.767
ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM FOR THE

04:05:48.834 --> 04:05:50.068
SAME STANDARDS THAT ALREADY

04:05:50.135 --> 04:05:51.303
EXIST. IMPORTANTLY, JUST TO

04:05:51.369 --> 04:05:52.604
NOTE, FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO VOTED

04:05:52.671 --> 04:05:54.906
ON A SIMILAR BILL BEFORE, THIS

04:05:54.973 --> 04:05:56.441

04:07:04.442 --> 04:07:06.011
COMPROMISED AND OVERRIDDEN BY

COMPETITION. SB 384 SEEKS TO

04:52:05.241 --> 04:52:07.676
CLEARLY DEFINE THAT PRICE FIXING

04:52:07.743 --> 04:52:10.846
IS STILL PRICE FIXING. IF A

04:52:10.913 --> 04:52:12.081
MACHINE DOES IT, INSTEAD OF A

04:52:12.147 --> 04:52:15.017

04:52:27.563 --> 04:52:29.064
THIS AS THE ADAPTATION OF SORT

04:52:29.131 --> 04:52:31.066
OF CLASSIC ANTITRUST LAW TO THE

04:52:31.133 --> 04:52:33.569
SAME OLD PRICE FIXING BEHAVIOR

04:52:33.636 --> 04:52:35.871
IN NEW GUISES AND FORMATS DUE TO

04:52:35.938 --> 04:52:37.206
THE INCREASING CAPACITY OF

04:52:37.273 --> 04:52:39.742
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND

04:52:43.045 --> 04:52:44.346
BENEFITS OF MARKETPLACE

04:52:44.413 --> 04:52:46.548
COMPETITION BETWEEN VARIOUS

04:52:46.615 --> 04:52:47.983
SELLERS, WHICH IS THE PRIMARY

04:52:48.050 --> 04:52:50.519
LEVER FOR DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON

04:52:50.586 --> 04:52:51.987
PRICES IN MARKET BASED

04:52:52.054 --> 04:52:54.456
CAPITALISM. WHEN SELLERS COLLUDE

04:52:54.523 --> 04:52:55.925
SECRETIVELY TO KEEP PRICES

04:52:55.991 --> 04:52:57.359
ARTIFICIALLY HIGH, THE CONSUMERS

04:52:57.426 --> 04:52:59.862
LOSE THEIR SINGLE STRONGEST

04:52:59.929 --> 04:53:01.997
WEAPON, WHICH IS THE ABILITY TO

04:53:02.064 --> 04:53:03.832
WALK TO A DIFFERENT SELLER.

04:53:03.899 --> 04:53:05.567
SHOULD ONE PARTICULAR SELLER

04:53:05.634 --> 04:53:08.137
RAISE THEIR PRICE WAY TOO HIGH.

04:53:08.203 --> 04:53:10.539

YEAH. AND YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY

04:55:06.922 --> 04:55:07.923
THERE'S A THIRD BILL WE'VE HEARD

04:55:07.990 --> 04:55:10.225
IN THIS SPACE TODAY. AND SO I

04:55:10.292 --> 04:55:11.727
THINK A LOT OF THE COMMENTARY ON

04:55:11.794 --> 04:55:13.095
IT BOTH IN SUPPORT AND

04:55:13.162 --> 04:55:13.796
OPPOSITION, HAPPENED EARLIER

04:55:13.862 --> 04:55:15.798
WITH SOME OF THE KIND OF SIMILAR

04:55:15.864 --> 04:55:19.835
ISSUES AND CONCERNS RAISED. AND

04:55:19.902 --> 04:55:21.036
SO, YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK THAT

04:55:21.103 --> 04:55:22.771
ALL NEEDS TO BE REPEATED. I

04:55:22.838 --> 04:55:24.206
THINK THE ONE, THE ONE THING

04:55:24.273 --> 04:55:26.341
THAT WILL BE REPEATED IS JUST

04:55:26.408 --> 04:55:28.477
THAT, JUST TO ENCOURAGE THE

04:55:28.544 --> 04:55:29.144
THREE AUTHORS TO CAN CONTINUE TO

04:55:29.211 --> 04:55:29.778
WORK WITH ONE ANOTHER. I THINK

04:55:29.845 --> 04:55:31.847
MISS CARLTON MAKES A FAIR POINT

04:55:31.914 --> 04:55:33.482
THAT WE DON'T WANT DIFFERENT

04:55:33.549 --> 04:55:35.417
RULES. AND CERTAINLY I DON'T

04:55:35.484 --> 04:55:36.585
THINK THREE DIFFERENT BILLS ARE

04:55:36.652 --> 04:55:38.687
GOING TO BE CHAPTERED IF THEY'RE

04:55:38.754 --> 04:55:40.055
CERTAINLY IF NOT, IF THEY'RE

04:55:40.122 --> 04:55:40.889
INCONSISTENT WITH ONE ANOTHER.

04:55:40.956 --> 04:55:42.591
AND SO THAT'S KIND OF THE ROLE

04:55:42.658 --> 04:55:44.026
OF WHAT WE SEE HERE IN THE

04:55:44.093 --> 04:55:45.694
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AS WELL AS

04:55:45.761 --> 04:55:47.963
THE PRIVACY COMMITTEE, IS TO TRY

04:55:48.030 --> 04:55:49.865
TO ALIGN THEM THE BEST THAT WE

04:55:49.932 --> 04:55:50.499
CAN AS THEY MOVE FORWARD. ARE

04:55:50.566 --> 04:55:54.136
THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS?

04:55:54.203 --> 04:55:55.137
WELL, YOU KNOW, WE ALREADY HAVE

04:55:55.204 --> 04:55:57.473

04:55:57.539 --> 04:55:59.508

04:56:04.680 --> 04:56:06.882
FOR THE OTHER TWO BILLS. I JUST

04:56:06.949 --> 04:56:08.350
WANT TO ALIGN MYSELF WITH THE

04:56:08.417 --> 04:56:09.284
COMMENTS. ABSOLUTELY.

04:56:09.351 --> 04:56:09.985
CONSISTENCY. I WILL BE

04:56:10.052 --> 04:56:10.986
SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY, BUT

04:56:11.053 --> 04:56:12.855
JUST TO BE ON THE RECORD THAT I

04:56:12.921 --> 04:56:16.091
SEE THOSE POINTS, I WANTED TO

04:56:16.158 --> 04:56:17.860
MAKE THAT KNOWN FOR ME ON THE

04:56:17.926 --> 04:56:19.361
RECORD. SO THANK YOU. I'M GOING

04:56:19.428 --> 04:56:21.463
TO ECHO THOSE COMMENTS AS WELL.

04:56:21.530 --> 04:56:22.865
I'M SURE ALL OF IT WILL GET

04:56:22.931 --> 04:56:24.733
WORKED ON AND I WILL BE

04:56:24.800 --> 04:56:25.868
SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY.

04:56:25.934 --> 04:56:27.269
THANK YOU, MADAM VICE CHAIR.

04:56:27.336 --> 04:56:29.905
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. ECHOING

04:56:29.972 --> 04:56:32.341
I'M NOT GOING TO REPEAT WHAT I

04:56:32.407 --> 04:56:32.941
SAID EARLIER. I AFTER HAVING

04:56:33.008 --> 04:56:34.443
HEARD A NUMBER OF THESE BILLS.

04:56:34.510 --> 04:56:36.411
NOW MY THOUGHT PROCESS IS A

04:56:36.478 --> 04:56:37.980
LITTLE CLEARER. SO WHAT'S

04:56:38.046 --> 04:56:40.549
HAPPENING? LET'S NOT THROW THE

04:56:40.616 --> 04:56:42.050
BABY OUT WITH THE BATHWATER.

04:56:42.117 --> 04:56:44.153
WE'RE LOOKING AT AI AND I THINK

04:56:44.219 --> 04:56:44.887
THROUGH THE PRIVACY COMMITTEE

04:56:44.953 --> 04:56:47.389
WE'RE ALL LOOKING AT AI AND ITS

04:56:47.456 --> 04:56:49.858
AND ITS PLUSES AND MINUSES. BUT

04:56:49.925 --> 04:56:51.693
TO ADDRESS A TECHNOLOGY THAT

04:56:51.760 --> 04:56:53.495
THAT BUSINESS IS USING IN A

04:56:53.562 --> 04:56:55.731
LAWFUL WAY OR IF IT'S UNLAWFUL,

04:56:55.797 --> 04:56:57.399
THERE ARE OTHER REMEDIES IN

04:56:57.466 --> 04:56:59.668
FEDERAL LAW, STATE EXISTING

04:56:59.735 --> 04:57:01.370
STATE LAW THAT ADDRESSES

04:57:01.436 --> 04:57:03.205
IMPROPER USE OF INFORMATION OR

04:57:03.272 --> 04:57:04.706
COMPETITIVE INFORMATION OR

04:57:04.773 --> 04:57:06.808
NONPUBLIC INFORMATION. BUT LET'S

04:57:06.875 --> 04:57:08.076
I THINK LET'S JUST MAKE SURE

04:57:08.143 --> 04:57:10.078
THAT IN THIS CONSOLIDATION OF

04:57:10.145 --> 04:57:11.446
IDEAS HERE, THAT WE'RE NOT

04:57:11.513 --> 04:57:13.682
ATTACKING HOW BUSINESS DOES

04:57:13.749 --> 04:57:15.083
BUSINESS. AND THAT IS MY BIGGEST

04:57:15.150 --> 04:57:16.185
CONCERN. IT SOUNDS LIKE A

04:57:16.251 --> 04:57:17.619
SLIPPERY SLOPE. EVERYONE'S

04:57:17.686 --> 04:57:19.421
JOINED ON TO THIS. LET'S JUST BE

04:57:19.488 --> 04:57:21.256
CAREFUL THAT WE'RE NOT

04:57:21.323 --> 04:57:22.691
DESTROYING HOW BUSINESS DOES

04:57:22.758 --> 04:57:24.126
BUSINESS IN A LAWFUL LEGAL WAY.

04:57:24.193 --> 04:57:26.995
THANK YOU. YEAH. AND I THINK

04:57:27.062 --> 04:57:28.497
THAT WE I THINK ALL THE MEMBERS

04:57:28.564 --> 04:57:30.699
OF THE COMMITTEE ARE HAVE FAR

04:57:30.766 --> 04:57:32.401
GREATER KNOWLEDGE ON ALGORITHMIC

04:57:32.467 --> 04:57:34.903
COLLUSION THAN THEY DID A DAY

04:57:34.970 --> 04:57:35.837
AGO, BECAUSE WE GOT A CHANCE,

04:57:35.904 --> 04:57:39.308
THE BENEFIT OF HEARING THESE

04:57:39.374 --> 04:57:41.009
THREE BILLS. AND I KNOW OUR, OUR

04:57:41.076 --> 04:57:42.311
PRIVACY CHAIR, WHO'S A MEMBER

04:57:42.377 --> 04:57:44.413
HERE AND WAS HERE FOR THE OTHER

04:57:44.479 --> 04:57:46.114
PRESENTATIONS, IS ALSO GOING TO

04:57:46.181 --> 04:57:47.883
TAKE A KEEN LOOK AT THESE BILLS

04:57:47.950 --> 04:57:50.018
AS THEY MOVE FORWARD AS WELL.

04:57:50.085 --> 04:57:52.554
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE? YES.

04:57:52.621 --> 04:57:54.323
FIRST AND FOREMOST, I REALLY DO

04:57:54.389 --> 04:57:56.458
APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR POINTS. I

04:57:56.525 --> 04:58:00.095
WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THERE IS

04:58:00.162 --> 04:58:01.163
CLEARLY AN ISSUE TO RESOLVE,

04:58:01.230 --> 04:58:02.764
GIVEN THAT WE'RE ALL TRYING TO

04:58:02.831 --> 04:58:05.200
ADDRESS AN ISSUE THAT WE HAVE

04:58:05.267 --> 04:58:06.168
TALKED ABOUT, AND YOU'VE SEEN

04:58:06.235 --> 04:58:07.970
MULTIPLE BILLS. FIRST AND

04:58:08.036 --> 04:58:09.338
FOREMOST, I ACTUALLY WORKED IN

04:58:09.404 --> 04:58:11.707
TECHNOLOGY PRIOR TO THIS JOB, IF

04:58:11.773 --> 04:58:14.276
YOU WILL, AND I WILL SAY THAT,

04:58:14.343 --> 04:58:16.011
YOU KNOW, EVEN LAST YEAR WE HAD

04:58:16.078 --> 04:58:18.046
A NUMBER OF BILLS THAT WERE

04:58:18.113 --> 04:58:18.947
SIGNED INTO LAW AND EVENTUALLY

04:58:19.014 --> 04:58:20.549
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UNDER THE

04:58:20.616 --> 04:58:22.017
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTUALLY

04:58:22.084 --> 04:58:24.353
ALSO FOLLOWED SUIT. SO WHAT WE

04:58:24.419 --> 04:58:26.888
ARE DOING IS ADVANCING THE NEEDS

04:58:26.955 --> 04:58:28.156
OF THE PEOPLE FIRST AND

04:58:28.223 --> 04:58:30.392
FOREMOST. AND SB 384 BROADLY

04:58:30.459 --> 04:58:31.360
ADDRESSES PRICE SETTING TOOLS

04:58:31.426 --> 04:58:33.562
ACROSS ALL INDUSTRIES AND

04:58:33.629 --> 04:58:34.830
FOCUSES THE TERM SPECIFIED IN

04:58:34.896 --> 04:58:36.898
THE BILL, WHICH IS PRICE OR

04:58:36.965 --> 04:58:38.400
SUPPLY LEVEL OF A GOOD OR

04:58:38.467 --> 04:58:39.434
SERVICE RENT OR OCCUPANCY LEVEL

04:58:39.501 --> 04:58:41.937
OF A RENTAL PROPERTY. SO OUR

04:58:42.004 --> 04:58:43.705
BILL ALSO OFFERS AN AFFIRMATIVE

04:58:43.772 --> 04:58:45.240
DEFENSE TO THOSE WHO DO THEIR

04:58:45.307 --> 04:58:47.209
DUE DILIGENCE AND, AS YOU SAID,

04:58:47.276 --> 04:58:49.044
PRACTICES THEIR BUSINESS AND

04:58:49.111 --> 04:58:50.545
CONDUCTS THEIR BUSINESS IN A

04:58:50.612 --> 04:58:53.081
LAWFUL WAY. AND SO WE ARE NOT

04:58:53.148 --> 04:58:54.950
TRYING TO INFRINGE ON PEOPLE AND

04:58:55.017 --> 04:58:56.752
THE FREE MARKET, BUT WE ARE ALSO

04:58:56.818 --> 04:58:59.121
TRYING TO PROTECT THAT MARKET.

04:58:59.187 --> 04:59:00.689
AND SO WE ALSO DON'T HAVE A

04:59:00.756 --> 04:59:02.357
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION, BECAUSE

04:59:02.424 --> 04:59:04.126
I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE SMALL

04:59:04.192 --> 04:59:04.860
BUSINESSES THAT LITERALLY JUST

04:59:04.926 --> 04:59:07.329
WANT TO BUY A TOOL TO LET THEM

04:59:07.396 --> 04:59:09.231
CONDUCT THEIR BUSINESS. SO

04:59:09.298 --> 04:59:10.365
RESPECTFULLY. I ASK FOR AN AYE

04:59:10.432 --> 04:59:12.801
VOTE AND LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING

04:59:12.868 --> 04:59:15.904
WHAT HAPPENS. THANK YOU. MOTIONS

04:59:15.971 --> 04:59:17.372
DO PASS TO PRIVACY AND CONSUMER

04:59:17.439 --> 04:59:19.274
PROTECTION COMMITTEE. KALRA.

04:59:19.341 --> 04:59:21.943
AYE. KALRA. AYE. DIXON. DIXON.

04:59:22.010 --> 04:59:23.612
NÓ. BAUER-KAHAN. BRIAN.

04:59:23.679 --> 04:59:26.515
CONNOLLY. GARABEDIAN.

04:59:26.581 --> 04:59:27.883
GARABEDIAN. AYE. MACEDO.

04:59:27.949 --> 04:59:33.055
PACHECO. PACHECO. AYE. PAPIN.

SANCHEZ. STEPHANIE. STEPHANIE.

04:59:33.755 --> 04:59:36.024
AYE. ZEBRA. ZEBRA. AYE. ALL

04:59:36.091 --> 04:59:38.327
RIGHT. WE WILL PLACE THAT BILL

04:59:38.393 --> 04:59:41.963
ON CALL. DON'T HAVE SENATOR

04:59:42.030 --> 04:59:43.865
SENATOR ALLEN IN THE VICINITY.

04:59:43.932 --> 04:59:46.902
HE WAS HERE. OKAY, SO I'LL WAIT

04:59:46.968 --> 04:59:49.237
FOR SENATOR ALLEN TO COME BACK

04:59:49.304 --> 04:59:55.811
IN. HE HAS TWO BILLS TO PRESENT.

04:59:55.877 --> 04:59:58.613
SO WE HAVE. I WAS JUST SEEING MY

04:59:58.680 --> 05:00:00.515
LIKE I SEE MY SCREEN. I WAS

05:00:00.582 --> 05:00:02.451
WAVING TO MYSELF OUT THERE. I

05:00:02.517 --> 05:00:05.821
HAVEN'T SEEN THAT BEFORE, MADAM.

05:00:05.887 --> 05:00:16.231
YEAH. ALL RIGHT. WE HAVE UP NEXT

05:00:16.298 --> 05:00:20.402
ITEM 12 SB 601 BY SENATOR ALLEN.

05:00:20.469 --> 05:00:24.539
SENATOR ALLEN ALSO HAS SB 766

05:00:24.606 --> 05:00:26.308
AFTER THAT. SO WHENEVER YOU'RE

05:00:26.375 --> 05:00:28.009
READY. WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH,

05:00:28.076 --> 05:00:34.149
MISTER CHAIR. SO THIS BILL SEEKS

05:00:34.216 --> 05:00:35.250
TO CONTINUE IMPORTANT

05:00:35.317 --> 05:00:36.418
PROTECTIONS FOR CALIFORNIA'S

05:00:36.485 --> 05:00:39.888
WATERS FROM POLLUTION BY, BY BY

05:00:39.955 --> 05:00:41.790
LARGELY ENSHRINING SOME LONG

05:00:41.857 --> 05:00:42.824
STANDING FEDERAL PROTECTIONS

05:00:42.891 --> 05:00:44.326
INTO STATE LAW UNDER THE

05:00:44.393 --> 05:00:50.365
AUTHORITY OF OUR WATER BOARD. SO

05:00:50.432 --> 05:00:51.733
JUST TO GIVE SOME BACKGROUND,

05:00:51.800 --> 05:00:53.168
THE CALIFORNIA SO THE FEDERAL

05:00:53.235 --> 05:00:57.639
CLEAN WATER ACT PROVIDES FOR

05:00:57.706 --> 05:00:59.474
REGULATIONS OF THE DISCHARGE OF

05:00:59.541 --> 05:01:00.742
POLLUTANTS INTO WATERS OF THE

05:01:00.809 --> 05:01:02.978
UNITED STATES, WOTUS WATERS OF

05:01:03.044 --> 05:01:04.112
THE UNITED STATES, AND IT

05:01:04.179 --> 05:01:05.213
REQUIRES QUALITY STANDARDS FOR

05:01:05.280 --> 05:01:07.349
SURFACE WATER. 2023 THE US

05:01:07.416 --> 05:01:10.652
SUPREME COURT CAME DOWN WITH THE

05:01:10.719 --> 05:01:13.188
SACKETT RULING SACKETT V EPA,

05:01:13.255 --> 05:01:14.923
WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY NARROWED THE

05:01:14.990 --> 05:01:17.058
DEFINITION OF WOTUS TO NOT APPLY

05:01:17.125 --> 05:01:18.260
TO CERTAIN WETLANDS, STREAMS AND

05:01:18.326 --> 05:01:19.094
RIVERS THAT MIGHT OCCASIONALLY

05:01:19.161 --> 05:01:20.762
DRY UP. IT WAS A VERY KIND OF

05:01:20.829 --> 05:01:22.731
EAST COAST TYPE DECISION, BASED

05:01:22.798 --> 05:01:25.267
ON THE CONTINUAL FLOW OF WATER

05:01:25.333 --> 05:01:28.437
AND BY BY BY DOING THAT, THEY

05:01:28.503 --> 05:01:30.338
BASICALLY STRIPPED MANY WATERS

05:01:30.405 --> 05:01:32.107
HERE IN OUR STATE OF THEIR LONG

05:01:32.174 --> 05:01:32.874
STANDING FEDERAL PROTECTIONS,

05:01:32.941 --> 05:01:34.843
WHILE CREATING MORE UNCERTAINTY

05:01:34.910 --> 05:01:36.511
REGARDING WHICH WATERS REMAIN

05:01:36.578 --> 05:01:39.047
PROTECTED. NOW, THE STATE WATER

05:01:39.114 --> 05:01:41.950
BOARD, OF COURSE, SAW THE

05:01:42.017 --> 05:01:43.618
DECISION WITH SOME ALARM. THEY

05:01:43.685 --> 05:01:45.153
THEY NOTED THAT THIS DECISION IS

05:01:45.220 --> 05:01:46.521
MOST LIKELY TO IMPACT WATERS

05:01:46.588 --> 05:01:47.622
WITHIN THE CENTRAL VALLEY, WHICH

05:01:47.689 --> 05:01:48.657
INCLUDE LARGE NUMBERS OF

05:01:48.723 --> 05:01:49.958
ISOLATED VERNAL POOL WETLANDS,

05:01:50.025 --> 05:01:51.560
AND IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,

05:01:51.626 --> 05:01:53.395
WHICH HAS A PREVALENCE OF

05:01:53.462 --> 05:01:53.929
EPHEMERAL OR DISCONNECTED

05:01:53.995 --> 05:01:54.896
WATERS. EVEN THE LOS ANGELES

05:01:54.963 --> 05:01:58.099
RIVER IS NOT ALWAYS FLOWING. SO

05:01:58.166 --> 05:01:59.534
WE DO HAVE SOME STRONG STATE

05:01:59.601 --> 05:02:00.702
LAW, RIGHT? THERE'S THE

05:02:00.769 --> 05:02:02.804
PORTER-COLOGNE ACT, WHICH DOES

05:02:02.871 --> 05:02:03.839
CONTINUE TO REGULATE THESE

05:02:03.905 --> 05:02:06.408
WATERS. BUT BUT IT BUT IT LACKS

05:02:06.475 --> 05:02:09.211
SOME OF THE STRONGER PROTECTIONS

05:02:09.277 --> 05:02:12.814
THAT THAT THE CLEAN WATER ACT

05:02:12.881 --> 05:02:14.816
PROVIDED TO ALL OF THE WATERS

05:02:14.883 --> 05:02:16.218
THAT WERE DEFINED AS WATERS OF

05:02:16.284 --> 05:02:18.119
THE UNITED STATES UNDER THE

05:02:18.186 --> 05:02:19.955
CLEAN WATER ACT AND SOME OF THE

05:02:20.021 --> 05:02:21.857
PROTECTIONS THAT EXIST UNDER THE

05:02:21.923 --> 05:02:24.025
CLEAN WATER ACT THAT DON'T EXIST

05:02:24.092 --> 05:02:24.626
IN OUR PORTER-COLOGNE MAXIMUM

05:02:24.693 --> 05:02:26.895
DAILY LOAD REQUIREMENTS,

05:02:26.962 --> 05:02:28.697
IMPAIRED WATER LISTINGS, AS WELL

05:02:28.763 --> 05:02:30.565
AS SOME STRONGER PROTECTIONS FOR

05:02:30.632 --> 05:02:31.900
THE ENVIRONMENT AND HUMAN HEALTH

05:02:31.967 --> 05:02:34.035
IN ESTABLISHING WATER QUALITY

05:02:34.102 --> 05:02:35.070
OBJECTIVES. THE OTHER THING IS

05:02:35.136 --> 05:02:36.671
THAT THE ENFORCEMENT TOOLS UNDER

05:02:36.738 --> 05:02:37.806
THE PORTER-COLOGNE ACT ARE NOT

05:02:37.873 --> 05:02:40.342
AS STRONG AS UNDER THE CLEAN

05:02:40.408 --> 05:02:41.309
WATER ACT, WHICH UNDER THE CLEAN

05:02:41.376 --> 05:02:43.044
WATER ACT, THERE'S HIGH

05:02:43.111 --> 05:02:44.479
PENALTIES THAT ACT AS STRONG

05:02:44.546 --> 05:02:45.647
DETERRENTS. THEY INCLUDE

05:02:45.714 --> 05:02:46.948
INFLATIONARY ADJUSTMENTS, THE

05:02:47.015 --> 05:02:47.916
CLEAN WATER ACT, THE FEDERAL

05:02:47.983 --> 05:02:49.918
CLEAN WATER ACT, PROVIDES

05:02:49.985 --> 05:02:50.919
OPPORTUNITIES FOR CITIZEN

05:02:50.986 --> 05:02:53.188
ENFORCEMENT OF VIOLATIONS TO

05:02:53.255 --> 05:02:54.256
SUPPLEMENT AGENCY EFFORTS TO

05:02:54.322 --> 05:02:56.491
HOLD POLLUTERS ACCOUNTABLE. SO

05:02:56.558 --> 05:02:57.826
THAT MEANS THAT POLLUTER

05:02:57.893 --> 05:02:59.261
ACCOUNTABILITY UNDER THE CLEAN

05:02:59.327 --> 05:03:00.262
WATER ACT IS NOT DEPENDENT ON

05:03:00.328 --> 05:03:02.130
AGENCY, STAFFING AND RESOURCES,

05:03:02.197 --> 05:03:03.198
WHICH IS ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS

05:03:03.265 --> 05:03:06.735
WITH PORTER-COLOGNE NOW. IN

05:03:06.801 --> 05:03:08.236
CONTRAST, DATA FROM THE STATE

05:03:08.303 --> 05:03:09.704
WATER BOARD INDICATES NO

05:03:09.771 --> 05:03:11.773
ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS WERE TAKEN

05:03:11.840 --> 05:03:13.608
EVERY YEAR SINCE 2017, IN ORDER

05:03:13.675 --> 05:03:17.979
IN OVER 70% OF KNOWN WASTE

05:03:18.046 --> 05:03:19.381
DISCHARGE REQUIREMENT

05:03:19.447 --> 05:03:20.348
VIOLATIONS. SO WE'RE TALKING

05:03:20.415 --> 05:03:22.551
ABOUT DISCHARGES, VIOLATIONS

05:03:22.617 --> 05:03:24.786
THAT ARE KNOWN, AND WE'VE STILL

05:03:24.853 --> 05:03:27.088
NOT TAKEN ACTION IN ALMOST THREE

05:03:27.155 --> 05:03:29.491
QUARTERS OF THEM SINCE 2017. SO

05:03:29.558 --> 05:03:30.825
EVEN NOT EVEN A COMPLIANCE

05:03:30.892 --> 05:03:32.060
ACTION OR INFORMAL ACTION FOR

05:03:32.127 --> 05:03:34.329
THE MAJORITY, FOR A STRONG

05:03:34.396 --> 05:03:35.764
MAJORITY OF VIOLATIONS. AND

05:03:35.830 --> 05:03:37.032
WHILE IT'S TRUE THAT LAST YEAR

05:03:37.098 --> 05:03:38.733
WE DID ALLOCATE MORE RESOURCES

05:03:38.800 --> 05:03:40.302
TO THE WATER BOARD FOR INCREASED

05:03:40.368 --> 05:03:42.237
STAFFING AND REQUIRE THOSE STATE

05:03:42.304 --> 05:03:43.538
WATER BOARD NOW TO REPORT BACK

05:03:43.605 --> 05:03:44.573
ON ITS IMPACTS TO THEIR

05:03:44.639 --> 05:03:46.841
WORKLOAD, WE KNOW AT THE END OF

05:03:46.908 --> 05:03:48.310
THE DAY, IT'S MY STRONG FEELING

05:03:48.376 --> 05:03:50.178
THAT WE DON'T NEED TO WAIT FOR A

05:03:50.245 --> 05:03:51.846
REPORT TO KNOW THAT THE

05:03:51.913 --> 05:03:52.981
STANDARDS AND TOOLS UNDER THE

05:03:53.048 --> 05:03:54.683
CLEAN WATER ACT ARE STRONGER

05:03:54.749 --> 05:03:55.684
THAN THOSE UNDER PORTER-COLOGNE,

05:03:55.750 --> 05:03:57.152
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE RECENT

05:03:57.218 --> 05:03:58.787
TRACK RECORD OF THE WATER BOARD

05:03:58.853 --> 05:04:00.488
AND THEIR LACK OF RESOURCES AND

05:04:00.555 --> 05:04:02.991
ENFORCEMENT. AND MEANWHILE,

05:04:03.058 --> 05:04:04.859
WE'VE GOT INCREASING INDICATIONS

05:04:04.926 --> 05:04:05.894
THAT THERE MAY BE FURTHER

05:04:05.961 --> 05:04:07.028
CHANGES TO THE DEFINITION OF THE

05:04:07.095 --> 05:04:08.797
WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES AT

05:04:08.863 --> 05:04:10.365
THE FEDERAL LEVEL, WHICH COULD

05:04:10.432 --> 05:04:11.333
CREATE SOME ADDITIONAL

05:04:11.399 --> 05:04:12.701
UNCERTAINTY. SO THIS BILL IS

05:04:12.767 --> 05:04:13.802
ULTIMATELY ABOUT TRYING TO

05:04:13.868 --> 05:04:15.837
ENSURE THAT WE DON'T BACKSLIDE.

05:04:15.904 --> 05:04:17.706
SO SPECIFICALLY, IT WOULD APPLY

05:04:17.772 --> 05:04:19.174
PROTECTIONS FOR POINT SOURCE

05:04:19.240 --> 05:04:20.709
DISCHARGES, SUCH AS FROM A PIPE

05:04:20.775 --> 05:04:22.911
OR SPECIFIC DRAINAGE DITCH, INTO

05:04:22.978 --> 05:04:24.212
NEXUS WATERS, WHICH ARE

05:04:24.279 --> 05:04:26.715
ANALOGOUS TO THOSE WHICH WERE

05:04:26.781 --> 05:04:28.283
FEDERALLY PROTECTED, YOU KNOW,

05:04:28.350 --> 05:04:29.618
THROUGH INTEGRATION OF NEXUS

05:04:29.684 --> 05:04:31.753
WATERS INTO THE CLEAN WATER ACT,

05:04:31.820 --> 05:04:32.921
IMPLEMENTING STATUTE. AND THIS

05:04:32.988 --> 05:04:35.390
THIS DEFINITION IS DESIGNED TO

05:04:35.457 --> 05:04:36.791
CAPTURE SURFACE WATERS WHICH ARE

05:04:36.858 --> 05:04:37.826
NOT CURRENTLY FEDERALLY

05:04:37.892 --> 05:04:40.528
REGULATED. BUT, YOU KNOW, THAT

05:04:40.595 --> 05:04:41.863
WE'RE NOT EXCLUDED FROM A PRE

05:04:41.930 --> 05:04:43.999
BIDEN ERA WOTUS RULE, AND WE'RE

05:04:44.065 --> 05:04:48.036
NOT ALREADY DEEMED TO BE NOT A

05:04:48.103 --> 05:04:51.640
WOTUS PRE SACKETT. SO, SO THUS

05:04:51.706 --> 05:04:53.141
MOSTLY IT'S ULTIMATELY ABOUT

05:04:53.208 --> 05:04:54.075
TRYING TO CAPTURE WATERS THAT

05:04:54.142 --> 05:04:54.976
WOULD HAVE BEEN FEDERALLY

05:04:55.043 --> 05:04:56.077
PROTECTED PRIOR TO SACKETT. SO

05:04:56.144 --> 05:04:57.646
THESE WATERS THAT WERE PROTECTED

05:04:57.712 --> 05:04:59.981
FOR MANY, MANY YEARS UNTIL UNDER

05:05:00.048 --> 05:05:01.383
THE CLEAN WATER ACT DECISION

05:05:01.449 --> 05:05:04.452
UNTIL STACK IT UP. THE BILL ALSO

05:05:04.519 --> 05:05:06.354
WOULD ALLOW FOR ENFORCEMENT OF

05:05:06.421 --> 05:05:09.591
VIOLATIONS OR OR OF REQUIREMENTS

05:05:09.658 --> 05:05:10.992
OR STANDARDS FOR NEXUS WATERS BY

05:05:11.059 --> 05:05:12.460
PUBLIC PROSECUTORS, AND BOLSTER

05:05:12.527 --> 05:05:13.561
ENFORCEMENT BY ALLOWING PENALTY

05:05:13.628 --> 05:05:14.996
AMOUNTS TO BE ADJUSTED FOR

05:05:15.063 --> 05:05:17.098
INFLATION. NOW REMEMBER, THE

05:05:17.165 --> 05:05:19.534
CLEAN WATER ACT PROVIDES FOR A

05:05:19.601 --> 05:05:22.137
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. WE

05:05:22.203 --> 05:05:23.338
SPECIFICALLY TOOK THAT OUT OF

05:05:23.405 --> 05:05:26.174
THE BILL BECAUSE OF CONCERNS.

05:05:26.241 --> 05:05:27.509
YOU KNOW, THIS THE JUDICIARY

05:05:27.575 --> 05:05:28.743
COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, WE

05:05:28.810 --> 05:05:29.944
ALL KNOW THE PRA CONCERNS THAT

05:05:30.011 --> 05:05:31.946
ARE ALWAYS OUT THERE. SO WE

05:05:32.013 --> 05:05:33.915
DECIDED TO PUT THIS IN THE HANDS

05:05:33.982 --> 05:05:34.783
OF PUBLIC PROSECUTORS. AND LET

05:05:34.849 --> 05:05:37.285
ME JUST SAY, THE WAY WE WROTE

05:05:37.352 --> 05:05:38.353
IT, PUBLIC PROSECUTORS WOULD NOT

05:05:38.420 --> 05:05:40.555
BE ABLE TO BRING AN ACTION IN

05:05:40.622 --> 05:05:42.724
THOSE CASES WHERE THE APPLICABLE

05:05:42.791 --> 05:05:44.092
REGIONAL WATER BOARD OR THE

05:05:44.159 --> 05:05:45.960
STATE BOARD OR THE ATTORNEY

05:05:46.027 --> 05:05:47.295
GENERAL ARE ALREADY, YOU KNOW,

05:05:47.362 --> 05:05:48.063
ENGAGING AND INVESTIGATING,

05:05:48.129 --> 05:05:50.632
PROSECUTING A VIOLATION. SO WE

05:05:50.699 --> 05:05:54.803
DON'T HAVE DOUBLE JEOPARDY FOR,

05:05:54.869 --> 05:05:56.571
FOR FOLKS. ADDITIONALLY, IF THE

05:05:56.638 --> 05:05:57.906
BILL ADVANCES OUT OF COMMITTEE

05:05:57.972 --> 05:05:59.741
TODAY, WE'VE BEEN WORKING REALLY

05:05:59.808 --> 05:06:00.508
HARD ON PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO

05:06:00.575 --> 05:06:01.676
ADDRESS A NUMBER OF CONCERNS

05:06:01.743 --> 05:06:03.945
ABOUT THE BILL RAISED BY THE

05:06:04.012 --> 05:06:04.512
OPPOSITION COALITION ON THE

05:06:04.579 --> 05:06:05.180
WATER QUALITY AND THE PERMITTING

05:06:05.246 --> 05:06:06.748
SIDE OF THE BILL. ALSO, THE

05:06:06.815 --> 05:06:08.450
SCOPE OF THE BILL, WE'RE GOING

05:06:08.516 --> 05:06:10.085
TO BE TAKING SOME ADDITIONAL

05:06:10.151 --> 05:06:11.186
AMENDMENTS AND REALLY CONTINUING

05:06:11.252 --> 05:06:13.254
TO WORK ON, ON ON NARROWING OVER

05:06:13.321 --> 05:06:14.456
AT THE SDM COMMITTEE WHERE IT'S

05:06:14.522 --> 05:06:17.892
GOING NEXT. SO LET ME JUST

05:06:17.959 --> 05:06:18.727
OBVIOUSLY, SPECIFICALLY THANK

05:06:18.793 --> 05:06:20.562
THE OPPOSITION COALITION FOR

05:06:20.628 --> 05:06:21.930
COMING TO THE TABLE TO DISCUSS

05:06:21.996 --> 05:06:23.364
AND WORK ON LANGUAGE, INCLUDING

05:06:23.431 --> 05:06:24.199
PRECISELY HOW THE BILL

05:06:24.265 --> 05:06:25.166
INCORPORATES NEXUS WATERS INTO

05:06:25.233 --> 05:06:26.935
THE CLEAN WATER ACT FRAMEWORK

05:06:27.001 --> 05:06:28.436
THROUGH BACKDATING AND THE

05:06:28.503 --> 05:06:29.838
DEFINITION OF NEXUS WATERS. AND

05:06:29.904 --> 05:06:31.239
WITH ME TODAY, WE'VE GOT SEAN

05:06:31.306 --> 05:06:32.607
BOTHWELL FROM CALIFORNIA

05:06:32.674 --> 05:06:33.742
COASTKEEPER ALLIANCE, AND ALSO

05:06:33.808 --> 05:06:35.977
MARCUS MASON FROM CALIFORNIA

05:06:36.044 --> 05:06:37.712
ENVIRONMENTAL VOTERS. THANK YOU.

05:06:37.779 --> 05:06:38.780
GOOD AFTERNOON. CHAIR. COMMITTEE

05:06:38.847 --> 05:06:40.148
MEMBERS SEAN BOTHWELL, EXECUTIVE

05:06:40.215 --> 05:06:41.015
DIRECTOR FOR CALIFORNIA

05:06:41.082 --> 05:06:43.084
COASTKEEPER ALLIANCE. THE SECOND

05:06:43.151 --> 05:06:45.186
DECISION MADE THE DECISION THAT

05:06:45.253 --> 05:06:47.422
WATERS IN CALIFORNIA THAT DON'T

05:06:47.489 --> 05:06:49.324
FLOW RELATIVELY PERMANENTLY ARE

05:06:49.390 --> 05:06:51.092
NO LONGER FEDERALLY PROTECTED.

05:06:51.159 --> 05:06:53.495
AND SO THAT IS WHY WE'RE HERE

05:06:53.561 --> 05:06:54.129
TODAY, TO CREATE A BACKSTOP, TO

05:06:54.195 --> 05:06:55.363
CONTINUE TO PROTECT THOSE WATERS

05:06:55.430 --> 05:06:56.831
THE WAY THEY'VE BEEN PROTECTED

05:06:56.898 --> 05:06:58.600
FOR OVER 50 YEARS. THAT MEANS

05:06:58.666 --> 05:07:00.168
THAT A LOT MORE PERMITS AND A

05:07:00.235 --> 05:07:01.936
LOT MORE WATERWAYS ARE GOING TO

05:07:02.003 --> 05:07:02.837
BE REGULATED UNDER

05:07:02.904 --> 05:07:03.638
PORTER-COLOGNE INSTEAD OF THE

05:07:03.705 --> 05:07:05.273
CLEAN WATER ACT. AND

05:07:05.340 --> 05:07:07.208
PORTER-COLOGNE IS NOT UP TO THE

05:07:07.275 --> 05:07:08.810
SNUFF OF THE CLEAN WATER ACT.

05:07:08.877 --> 05:07:10.111
NOW, CALIFORNIA HAS A REPUTATION

05:07:10.178 --> 05:07:11.679
FOR BEING ENVIRONMENTAL LEADER.

05:07:11.746 --> 05:07:12.947
IT IS NOT BECAUSE OF OUR

05:07:13.014 --> 05:07:13.948
PORTER-COLOGNE ACT. IT IS

05:07:14.015 --> 05:07:16.217
BECAUSE OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

05:07:16.284 --> 05:07:17.752
THE CLEAN WATER ACT THAT HAS

05:07:17.819 --> 05:07:20.321
MADE US AN ENVIRONMENTAL LEADER.

05:07:20.388 --> 05:07:21.589
UNDER THE CLEAN WATER ACT,

05:07:21.656 --> 05:07:23.258
CALIFORNIA HAS SEVERAL TOOLS

05:07:23.324 --> 05:07:24.793
THAT ARE MUCH STRONGER THAN THE

05:07:24.859 --> 05:07:26.394
PORTER-COLOGNE ACT, ONE BEING

05:07:26.461 --> 05:07:28.229
TMDLS AND THREE AND D LIST THAT

05:07:28.296 --> 05:07:29.964
THE SENATOR ALLUDED TO. WE HAVE

05:07:30.031 --> 05:07:32.333
BEEN 303 D LISTS ARE ESSENTIALLY

05:07:32.400 --> 05:07:34.936
THE MOST POLLUTED WATERS IN

05:07:35.003 --> 05:07:36.070
CALIFORNIA. IT'S THE LIST OF

05:07:36.137 --> 05:07:38.006
MOST POLLUTED WATERS. AND SO

05:07:38.072 --> 05:07:38.606
THEY ARE TREATED SPECIALLY AND

05:07:38.673 --> 05:07:41.176
ARE CREATED CREATE TMDLS TO

05:07:41.242 --> 05:07:42.844
ADDRESS THEM. TMDLS ARE LIKE A

05:07:42.911 --> 05:07:44.712
PRESCRIPTION TELLS THE

05:07:44.779 --> 05:07:45.713
DISCHARGER YOU CAN DISCHARGE

05:07:45.780 --> 05:07:46.848
THIS AMOUNT OF POLLUTION AND THE

05:07:46.915 --> 05:07:48.716
WATERWAY WILL GET HEALTHIER OVER

05:07:48.783 --> 05:07:49.951
TIME. WE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING

05:07:50.018 --> 05:07:51.519
THOSE FOR DECADES NOW, AT LEAST

05:07:51.586 --> 05:07:53.288
20 YEARS DEVELOPING THEM AND

05:07:53.354 --> 05:07:55.590
IMPLEMENTING THEM. THOSE GO AWAY

05:07:55.657 --> 05:07:57.725
FOR NEXUS WATERS. IF SB 601 DOES

05:07:57.792 --> 05:07:59.227
NOT PASS, ALL OF THAT WORK GOES

05:07:59.294 --> 05:08:00.395
AWAY. FOR THOSE WATERWAYS THAT

05:08:00.461 --> 05:08:01.796
ARE NO LONGER FEDERALLY

05:08:01.863 --> 05:08:02.597
PROTECTED BECAUSE THOSE ARE

05:08:02.664 --> 05:08:05.834
FEDERALLY FEDERAL TOOLS. OUR

05:08:05.900 --> 05:08:07.735
PERMITS, OUR PERMITS HAVE

05:08:07.802 --> 05:08:09.170
ALREADY BEEN TRANSLATED, THOSE

05:08:09.237 --> 05:08:11.272
TMDLS INTO PERMIT TERMS. AND

05:08:11.339 --> 05:08:12.607
THOSE WOULD ALSO GO AWAY BECAUSE

05:08:12.674 --> 05:08:14.275
THEY'RE NOW STATE PERMITS. AND

05:08:14.342 --> 05:08:15.643
STATE PERMITS ARE FAR WEAKER

05:08:15.710 --> 05:08:17.011
THAN CLEAN WATER ACT PERMITS.

05:08:17.078 --> 05:08:18.112
UNDER OUR CURRENT STATE

05:08:18.179 --> 05:08:20.181
PERMITTING SYSTEM, WE HAVE

05:08:20.248 --> 05:08:21.382
MONITORING THAT'S INSUFFICIENT

05:08:21.449 --> 05:08:23.151
TO KNOW WHO'S POLLUTING AND

05:08:23.218 --> 05:08:25.186
WHERE. CONFIDENTIAL REPORTING.

05:08:25.253 --> 05:08:26.821
SO WE DON'T KNOW WHO'S POLLUTING

05:08:26.888 --> 05:08:27.856
AND WHERE THEY'RE POLLUTING

05:08:27.922 --> 05:08:31.492
FROM. AND THEY AGGREGATE DATA TO

05:08:31.559 --> 05:08:32.560
PURPOSELY HIDE WHO ARE THE

05:08:32.627 --> 05:08:34.462
POLLUTERS AND NOT HOLD FOLKS

05:08:34.529 --> 05:08:37.632
ACCOUNTABLE. AND SO SB 601 FIXES

05:08:37.699 --> 05:08:39.534
THAT AND CREATES PERMITS AKIN TO

05:08:39.601 --> 05:08:41.536
WHAT WAS UNDER THE CLEAN WATER

05:08:41.603 --> 05:08:42.937
ACT. I'LL JUST CLOSE BY SAYING

05:08:43.004 --> 05:08:44.839
WITHOUT SB 601, WE WILL GO

05:08:44.906 --> 05:08:46.040
BACKWARDS AND WE WILL NOT BE

05:08:46.107 --> 05:08:47.041
CONSIDERED AN ENVIRONMENTAL

05:08:47.108 --> 05:08:48.643
LEADER ON WATER QUALITY UNLESS

05:08:48.710 --> 05:08:50.979
WE GET THIS SECOND DECISION

05:08:51.045 --> 05:08:52.380
ADDRESSED. THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

05:08:52.447 --> 05:08:53.882
HELLO, MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE.

05:08:53.948 --> 05:08:54.883
MY NAME IS MARK MASON. THE

05:08:54.949 --> 05:08:56.651
CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL VOTERS.

05:08:56.718 --> 05:08:57.785
DESPITE MAJOR WATER REFORM

05:08:57.852 --> 05:08:58.720
STRETCHING BACK SIX DECADES,

05:08:58.786 --> 05:08:59.921
PROVIDING SAFE AND AFFORDABLE

05:08:59.988 --> 05:09:00.989
DRINKING WATER ALONGSIDE

05:09:01.055 --> 05:09:02.156
ADEQUATE RECREATIONAL,

05:09:02.223 --> 05:09:03.191
INDUSTRIAL AND CULTURAL SUPPLY

05:09:03.258 --> 05:09:04.993
REMAINS A PERSISTENT CHALLENGE.

05:09:05.059 --> 05:09:05.593
DROUGHT AND GROUNDWATER

05:09:05.660 --> 05:09:08.162
OVERPUMPING HAS LED TO A SHARP

05:09:08.229 --> 05:09:08.663
DECLINE IN OUR RIVER AND

05:09:08.730 --> 05:09:09.964
RESERVOIR WATER QUALITY AS WE

05:09:10.031 --> 05:09:10.899
CONTINUE TO BE HIT ON BOTH SIDES

05:09:10.965 --> 05:09:12.934
BY CLIMATE CHANGE, WITH ERRATIC

05:09:13.001 --> 05:09:13.968
SEASONAL VARIANTS COUPLED WITH A

05:09:14.035 --> 05:09:15.003
WARMING CLIMATE. PUBLIC AND

05:09:15.069 --> 05:09:16.437
PRIVATE ENTITIES SPEND BILLIONS

05:09:16.504 --> 05:09:18.239
UPWARD OF TEN PLUS ON POLLUTION

05:09:18.306 --> 05:09:18.940
PREVENTION, MITIGATION AND

05:09:19.007 --> 05:09:20.475
FILTERING FOR CALIFORNIA'S

05:09:20.541 --> 05:09:21.843
WATER. WITH HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS

05:09:21.910 --> 05:09:23.278
MORE ANNUALLY IN NEED, WE CAN'T

05:09:23.344 --> 05:09:24.812
AFFORD TO LET REGULATED ENTITIES

05:09:24.879 --> 05:09:25.947
SHIRK RESPONSIBILITY OR TO LET

05:09:26.014 --> 05:09:28.049
OUR REGULATORY PROTECTIONS

05:09:28.116 --> 05:09:29.717
BACKSLIDE, WASTING PRECIOUS

05:09:29.784 --> 05:09:30.919
DOLLARS ON CLEANUP AND ABATEMENT

05:09:30.985 --> 05:09:32.020
THAT COULD GO TO PROACTIVELY

05:09:32.086 --> 05:09:33.121
MANAGING OUR STRAINED WATER

05:09:33.187 --> 05:09:35.657
SUPPLY. WITH SB 601, WE HAVE TO

05:09:35.723 --> 05:09:36.991
CONTEND WITH INCREASED RISK OF

05:09:37.058 --> 05:09:38.393
LEAD, MERCURY, ARSENIC,

05:09:38.459 --> 05:09:39.928
NITROGEN, PHOSPHORUS AND MORE,

05:09:39.994 --> 05:09:41.362
WHILE STATE REGULATORS BATTLE

05:09:41.429 --> 05:09:42.163
INADEQUATE PERMIT AUTHORITY AND

05:09:42.230 --> 05:09:44.599
THE CLIMATE BATTERS US. THIS,

05:09:44.666 --> 05:09:45.767
COUPLED WITH A NATIONAL

05:09:45.833 --> 05:09:46.668
AFFORDABILITY CRISIS, IS A

05:09:46.734 --> 05:09:48.236
RECIPE FOR DISASTER. WETLANDS

05:09:48.303 --> 05:09:49.604
ESTUARIES HAVE BEEN LEFT IN

05:09:49.671 --> 05:09:51.172
REGULATORY LIMBO DUE TO SOCKET

05:09:51.239 --> 05:09:53.274
AND AS A CRUCIAL SOURCE OF WATER

05:09:53.341 --> 05:09:54.275
PURIFICATION. NOT ONLY DO THEY

05:09:54.342 --> 05:09:55.777
ABSORB CONTAMINATE THE WATER,

05:09:55.843 --> 05:09:58.346
BUT THEY ALSO ACT AS A

05:09:58.413 --> 05:09:59.113
FRESHWATER AND SALTWATER BARRIER

05:09:59.180 --> 05:09:59.881
AND PROTECT FLORA AND FAUNA THAT

05:09:59.948 --> 05:10:02.050
OUR ECOSYSTEMS NEED TO THRIVE.

05:10:02.116 --> 05:10:03.651
SB 601 GIVES ALL CALIFORNIANS

05:10:03.718 --> 05:10:04.953

05:10:06.721 --> 05:10:08.389
OURSELVES FROM DISCHARGE AND

05:10:08.456 --> 05:10:10.491
POLLUTION. AS YOU CAN SEE WITH

05:10:10.558 --> 05:10:11.092
ENVIRONMENTALLY ANTAGONISTIC

05:10:11.159 --> 05:10:12.393
FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION, NOW IS

05:10:12.460 --> 05:10:14.295
NOT THE TIME TO ALLOW OUR WATER

05:10:14.362 --> 05:10:15.229
PROTECTIONS TO BACKSLIDE. WHILE

05:10:15.296 --> 05:10:16.864
FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION AND THE

05:10:16.931 --> 05:10:18.032
SUPREME COURT SEEK TO DISMANTLE

05:10:18.099 --> 05:10:19.400
CRITICAL PROTECTIONS, WE MUST

05:10:19.467 --> 05:10:21.769
HOLD THE LINE. CALIFORNIA'S 40

05:10:21.836 --> 05:10:23.504

05:10:23.571 --> 05:10:24.105
HALF DOZEN STATES HAVE ALREADY

05:10:24.172 --> 05:10:26.207
RISEN TO THE SECOND DECISION

05:10:26.274 --> 05:10:27.408
CHALLENGE. RESTORING CRITICAL

05:10:27.475 --> 05:10:28.543
PROTECTIONS IS THE LEAST WE CAN

05:10:28.609 --> 05:10:30.478
DO IN OUR NEW CLIMATE. THIS IS

05:10:30.545 --> 05:10:31.879
EVEN MORE TIMELY, AS THE SUPREME

05:10:31.946 --> 05:10:32.981
COURT LITERALLY EARLIER THIS

05:10:33.047 --> 05:10:34.983
YEAR, ROLLBACK POLLUTION

05:10:35.049 --> 05:10:36.818
DISCHARGE FOR SEWAGE. WHILE

CORPORATE POLLUTERS FIERCELY

05:10:37.952 --> 05:10:39.721
WORKED TO MAKE US SICK OR POORER

05:10:39.787 --> 05:10:41.823
AND LESS SAFE, WE MUST HOLD THE

05:10:41.889 --> 05:10:43.324

CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

05:12:11.679 --> 05:12:13.614
HERE, IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION

05:12:13.681 --> 05:12:16.417
TO SB 601. SO WHILE YOU'VE HEARD

05:12:16.484 --> 05:12:17.585
THAT THIS DECISION THAT THIS

05:12:17.652 --> 05:12:19.720
BILL IS INTENDED TO RETURN WATER

05:12:19.787 --> 05:12:21.222
QUALITY PROTECTIONS TO STATUS

05:12:21.289 --> 05:12:22.924
QUO PRIOR TO SACKETT, THE BILL

05:12:22.990 --> 05:12:24.826
GOES FAR BEYOND RESPONDING TO

05:12:24.892 --> 05:12:26.394
SACKETT. AND THERE ARE ELEMENTS

05:12:26.461 --> 05:12:27.695
OF THIS BILL THAT HAVE NO

05:12:27.762 --> 05:12:29.831
RELATION TO THAT COURT DECISION.

05:12:29.897 --> 05:12:31.532
IMPORTANTLY, THE LEGISLATURE HAS

05:12:31.599 --> 05:12:34.368
ACTED DECISIVELY TO RESPOND TO

05:12:34.435 --> 05:12:35.603
THAT DECISION, AND MY COLLEAGUE

05:12:35.670 --> 05:12:38.172
HERE IS GOING TO GET INTO SOME

05:12:38.239 --> 05:12:38.840
OF THE DETAILS ON WHAT THE

05:12:38.906 --> 05:12:40.241
LEGISLATURE DID LAST YEAR. BUT

05:12:40.308 --> 05:12:41.676
AMONG OTHER THINGS, AS THE

05:12:41.742 --> 05:12:43.144
AUTHOR NOTED, IS THAT THE

05:12:43.211 --> 05:12:44.178
LEGISLATURE DIRECTED THE STATE

05:12:44.245 --> 05:12:46.747
WATER BOARD TO DEVELOP A REPORT

05:12:46.814 --> 05:12:49.117
THAT LOOKS AT OBSERVED IMPACTS

05:12:49.183 --> 05:12:51.719
OF THE SACKETT DECISION AND

05:12:51.786 --> 05:12:53.955
PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE

05:12:54.021 --> 05:12:55.723
LEGISLATURE ON HOW TO HOW TO

05:12:55.790 --> 05:12:58.025
RESPOND TO THOSE IMPACTS. THIS

05:12:58.092 --> 05:12:59.227
BILL IS OBVIOUSLY PREEMPTING

05:12:59.293 --> 05:13:02.597
THAT REPORT. IT PROPOSES TO MAKE

05:13:02.663 --> 05:13:04.065
SWEEPING CHANGES BASED ON

05:13:04.132 --> 05:13:06.200
SPECULATION AND NOT EVIDENCE.

05:13:06.267 --> 05:13:07.568
THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS BILL

05:13:07.635 --> 05:13:09.437
WILL BE FAR REACHING. IT WILL

05:13:09.504 --> 05:13:10.471
POSE ADDITIONAL RED TAPE AND

05:13:10.538 --> 05:13:12.607
MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO DO

05:13:12.673 --> 05:13:13.708
BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA, MORE

05:13:13.774 --> 05:13:15.009
DIFFICULT TO BUILD HOUSING,

05:13:15.076 --> 05:13:17.345
WATER SUPPLY, INFRASTRUCTURE.

05:13:17.411 --> 05:13:18.880
AND WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS

05:13:18.946 --> 05:13:20.314
THAT CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS THE

05:13:20.381 --> 05:13:22.016
MOST PROTECTIVE WATER QUALITY

05:13:22.083 --> 05:13:24.252
REGIME OF ANY STATE IN THE

05:13:24.318 --> 05:13:25.887
NATION. ANY WATER BODY THAT LOST

05:13:25.953 --> 05:13:27.722
PROTECTIONS FOLLOWING THE SAC

05:13:27.788 --> 05:13:28.856
DECISION IS STILL PROTECTED

05:13:28.923 --> 05:13:30.658
UNDER STATE LAW. AND I WANT TO

05:13:30.725 --> 05:13:32.393
READ A QUOTE FROM THE STATE

05:13:32.460 --> 05:13:34.095
WATER BOARD FOLLOWING THIS

05:13:34.162 --> 05:13:35.096
DECISION. THOUGH THE STATE WATER

05:13:35.163 --> 05:13:36.864
BOARD IS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED

05:13:36.931 --> 05:13:38.566
IN THE DECISION AND THE ADVERSE

05:13:38.633 --> 05:13:40.334
IMPACTS IT WILL HAVE NATIONALLY,

05:13:40.401 --> 05:13:41.936
IT ONLY NARROWS THE SCOPE OF

05:13:42.003 --> 05:13:43.638
FEDERAL JURISDICTION AND DOES

05:13:43.704 --> 05:13:45.806
NOT WEAKEN CALIFORNIA'S MORE

05:13:45.873 --> 05:13:47.575
STRINGENT WETLANDS PROTECTIONS.

05:13:47.642 --> 05:13:49.610
IN ADDITION TO THE WATER BOARD.

05:13:49.677 --> 05:13:50.811
GOVERNOR NEWSOM AND ATTORNEY

05:13:50.878 --> 05:13:52.613
GENERAL BONTA ISSUED SIMILAR

05:13:52.680 --> 05:13:54.015
STATEMENTS, ESSENTIALLY SAYING,

05:13:54.081 --> 05:13:55.783
WHILE WE DON'T AGREE WITH THE

05:13:55.850 --> 05:13:57.151
DECISION HERE IN CALIFORNIA,

05:13:57.218 --> 05:13:59.153
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAVE MUCH OF

05:13:59.220 --> 05:14:00.221
AN IMPACT. AND THOSE QUOTES ARE

05:14:00.288 --> 05:14:02.990
INCLUDED IN OUR COMMENT LETTERS.

05:14:03.057 --> 05:14:04.659
SO I THINK THESE RESPONSES FROM

05:14:04.725 --> 05:14:06.394
STATE LEADERS REALLY ILLUSTRATE

05:14:06.460 --> 05:14:07.828
THAT THERE IS NOT AN IMMINENT

05:14:07.895 --> 05:14:09.564
THREAT THAT JUSTIFIES RUSHING

05:14:09.630 --> 05:14:11.399
THROUGH A BILL OF THIS SWEEPING

05:14:11.465 --> 05:14:13.734
IMPACT. WE ARE HOPING AND

05:14:13.801 --> 05:14:15.303
RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT THE

05:14:15.369 --> 05:14:16.337
LEGISLATURE ALLOW THE WATER

05:14:16.404 --> 05:14:18.039
BOARD TO COMPLETE THE WORK THAT

05:14:18.105 --> 05:14:19.640
IT DIRECTED IT TO DO, AND

05:14:19.707 --> 05:14:20.675
CONSIDER A TAILORED RESPONSE

05:14:20.741 --> 05:14:22.810
NEXT YEAR. THANK YOU. GOOD

05:14:22.877 --> 05:14:23.878
AFTERNOON, MISTER CHAIR AND

05:14:26.847 --> 05:14:28.816
OPPOSITION TO SB 601. AS MY

COLLEAGUE MENTIONED, THE

05:14:30.051 --> 05:14:31.185
LEGISLATURE ACTED SWIFTLY LAST

05:14:31.252 --> 05:14:32.553
YEAR TO ADDRESS ANY POTENTIAL

05:14:32.620 --> 05:14:34.355
GAPS IN CALIFORNIA WATER QUALITY

05:14:34.422 --> 05:14:36.190
PROTECTIONS CREATED BY THIS ACT.

05:14:36.257 --> 05:14:37.558
DECISION. THE LEGISLATURE

05:14:37.625 --> 05:14:40.394
INCLUDED 4.7 MILLION AND 26 PIES

05:14:40.461 --> 05:14:42.263
TO ENSURE THERE ARE RESOURCES

05:14:42.330 --> 05:14:43.998
AVAILABLE TO MAINTAIN PROTECTION

05:14:44.065 --> 05:14:45.299
OF CALIFORNIA'S WATER BODIES AND

05:14:45.366 --> 05:14:47.368
TAKE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.

05:14:47.435 --> 05:14:48.302
ADDITIONALLY, THE LEGISLATURE

05:14:48.369 --> 05:14:50.137
DIRECTED THE STATE WATER BOARD

05:14:50.204 --> 05:14:51.539
TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE BY

05:14:51.606 --> 05:14:53.774
JANUARY OF 2026 ON WHETHER THERE

05:14:53.841 --> 05:14:54.909
ARE ANY CHANGES NEEDED TO

05:14:54.976 --> 05:14:55.943
CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING WATER

05:14:56.010 --> 05:14:57.378
QUALITY PROTECTIONS TO MAINTAIN

05:14:57.445 --> 05:14:58.779
OUR STATE'S HIGH QUALITY, HIGH

05:14:58.846 --> 05:15:00.915
WATER QUALITY STANDARDS.

05:15:00.982 --> 05:15:02.083
ADDITIONALLY, THE LEGISLATURE

05:15:02.149 --> 05:15:05.219
JUST APPROVED 2.9 MILLION AND 12

05:15:05.286 --> 05:15:06.687
PIES TO PROVIDE LEGAL RESOURCES

05:15:06.754 --> 05:15:08.823
TO CAL EPA TO RESPOND TO FEDERAL

05:15:08.889 --> 05:15:10.691
ACTIONS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET.

05:15:10.758 --> 05:15:12.193
SO GIVEN THIS, WE SHOULD WAIT

05:15:12.260 --> 05:15:14.195
UNTIL WE GET THE REPORT FROM THE

05:15:14.262 --> 05:15:15.363
STATE WATER BOARD BEFORE WE TAKE

05:15:16.731 --> 05:15:18.199
CALIFORNIA WATER QUALITY RULES,

05:15:18.266 --> 05:15:19.600
IN ADDITION TO IT BEING

05:15:19.667 --> 05:15:23.571
PREMATURE. THE INVESTMENT IN

05:15:23.638 --> 05:15:25.373
ADDITIONAL ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES

05:15:25.439 --> 05:15:26.607
UNDERMINES THE NEED FOR

PROVIDING PUBLIC PROSECUTOR

05:15:27.975 --> 05:15:29.343

05:15:29.410 --> 05:15:30.845

05:15:30.911 --> 05:15:31.946

EXPERTISE THAT IS RARELY PRESENT

CLEAN WATER ACT DOES NOT GIVE

05:15:41.322 --> 05:15:43.157
ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY TO PUBLIC

05:15:43.224 --> 05:15:44.492

05:15:52.933 --> 05:15:53.901

05:16:04.078 --> 05:16:05.479
OF WHICH CAN LEAD TO RAPIDLY

05:16:05.546 --> 05:16:06.847
INCREASING FINES. JUST TO GIVE

05:21:01.108 --> 05:21:02.876
RELATIVE TO THE REPORT THAT'S

05:21:02.943 --> 05:21:03.944
COMING FROM THE STATE WATER

05:21:04.011 --> 05:21:05.379
BOARD. LET'S BE CLEAR, THE

05:21:05.446 --> 05:21:06.880
REASON WHY YOU'RE DOING IT NOW,

05:21:06.947 --> 05:21:09.249
AS YOU SAID, IS BECAUSE OVER 70%

05:21:09.316 --> 05:21:12.319
OF THE VIOLATIONS THAT THE STATE

05:21:12.386 --> 05:21:12.953
WATER BOARD IS OVERSEEING ARE

05:21:13.020 --> 05:21:14.955
NOT BEING INVESTIGATED AND OR

05:21:15.022 --> 05:21:17.591
ACTED UPON, AND I ASSUME

05:21:17.658 --> 05:21:19.627
DOESN'T. I'M NOT STRETCHING YOUR

05:21:19.693 --> 05:21:21.862
WORDS OR OR THE POINT THAT YOU

05:21:21.929 --> 05:21:22.730
WERE MAKING. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE

05:21:22.796 --> 05:21:24.732
BRINGING IT NOW, WHICH IS EVEN

05:21:24.798 --> 05:21:27.234
UNDER THE CURRENT REGIME, THERE

05:21:27.301 --> 05:21:29.103
ISN'T ENOUGH RESOURCES THAT THE

05:21:29.169 --> 05:21:31.338
STATE WATER BOARD HAS TO

05:21:31.405 --> 05:21:32.239
EFFECTIVELY GO AFTER THE

05:21:32.306 --> 05:21:34.808
POLLUTERS NOW, LET ALONE

05:21:34.875 --> 05:21:35.843
EXPANDING THE JURISDICTION TO

05:21:35.909 --> 05:21:37.745
THE NEXUS WATERWAYS. IS THAT

05:21:37.811 --> 05:21:38.912
CORRECT? THAT'S RIGHT. AND THEY

05:21:38.979 --> 05:21:40.247
USED TO RELY ON THE ENFORCEMENT

05:21:40.314 --> 05:21:41.715
MECHANISMS UNDER THE CWA FOR

05:21:41.782 --> 05:21:44.151
THIS SORT OF WORK. SO, SO AND

05:21:44.218 --> 05:21:45.786
THAT WAS A BIG QUESTION I HAD,

05:21:45.853 --> 05:21:48.355
WHICH IS WHY DON'T WE JUST WAIT

05:21:48.422 --> 05:21:48.956
FOR THE STATE WATER BOARD TO

05:21:49.023 --> 05:21:50.724
COME OUT WITH THEIR REPORT? I

05:21:50.791 --> 05:21:52.459
THINK THAT TO ME, THAT SPEAKS

05:21:52.526 --> 05:21:54.161
VERY CLEARLY AS TO WHY I DO WANT

05:21:54.228 --> 05:21:56.063
TO KIND OF GO BACK. THERE SEEMS

05:21:56.130 --> 05:21:57.064
TO BE SOME TENSION ABOUT WHETHER

05:21:57.131 --> 05:21:59.166
THE NEXUS WATERWAYS ARE ALREADY

05:21:59.233 --> 05:22:00.100
COVERED BY PORTER-COLOGNE OR

05:22:00.167 --> 05:22:01.869
WHETHER THEY'RE NOT, BECAUSE MY

05:22:01.935 --> 05:22:03.704
UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT THE SAC

05:22:03.771 --> 05:22:05.673
DECISION PUT THAT INTO SOME SORT

05:22:05.739 --> 05:22:06.907
OF AMBIGUITY ABOUT WHETHER

05:22:06.974 --> 05:22:09.443
THEY'RE COVERED OVER, UNDER

05:22:09.510 --> 05:22:10.878
PORTER-COLOGNE OR NOT. THE

05:22:10.944 --> 05:22:11.812
OPPOSITION SEEMS TO TAKE A

05:22:11.879 --> 05:22:14.515
POSITION THAT THEY ARE CLEARLY

05:22:14.581 --> 05:22:16.050
COVERED, AND SO IS THE POINT OF

05:22:16.116 --> 05:22:17.618
THIS BILL ACTUALLY TO COVER

05:22:17.685 --> 05:22:19.887
NEXUS. WATERWAYS THAT YOU ARE

05:22:19.953 --> 05:22:21.255
ARGUING ARE NOT ALREADY COVERED?

05:22:21.321 --> 05:22:22.690
BECAUSE I GUESS THAT'S ONE

05:22:22.756 --> 05:22:24.158
POINT. I AM A LITTLE CONFUSED

05:22:24.224 --> 05:22:26.727
UPON. YEAH, YEAH. I MEAN, I

05:22:26.794 --> 05:22:28.896
THINK IT HAS MORE TO DO WITH THE

05:22:28.962 --> 05:22:29.930
PROTECTIONS THAT WERE PROVIDED

05:22:29.997 --> 05:22:31.131
UNDER THE CLEAN WATER ACT THAT

05:22:31.198 --> 05:22:32.533
WERE NOT COVERED UNDER UNDER

05:22:32.599 --> 05:22:34.568
PORTER-COLOGNE. BUT YEAH.

05:22:34.635 --> 05:22:35.736
ASSEMBLY MEMBER, WHAT WE ARE

05:22:35.803 --> 05:22:37.137
TRYING TO DO WITH NEXUS WATERS

05:22:37.204 --> 05:22:38.505
IS ESSENTIALLY TREAT THEM LIKE

05:22:38.572 --> 05:22:40.340
THEY'RE STILL UNDER THE CLEAN

05:22:40.407 --> 05:22:41.842
WATER ACT. SO THEY WOULD GET THE

05:22:41.909 --> 05:22:43.711
SAME PERMIT THAT THEY HAD UNDER

05:22:43.777 --> 05:22:44.611
THE CLEAN WATER ACT, SAME

05:22:44.678 --> 05:22:45.813
STANDARDS. THE TMDLS, THE 303 D

05:22:45.879 --> 05:22:47.114
LIST WOULD STILL APPLY TO NEXUS

05:22:47.181 --> 05:22:48.749
WATERS, JUST LIKE THEY WOULD IF

05:22:48.816 --> 05:22:49.850
THEY WERE STILL FEDERALLY

05:22:49.917 --> 05:22:51.351
PROTECTED. SO IT'S TRUE THAT

05:22:51.418 --> 05:22:52.820
THEY ARE COVERED UNDER

05:22:52.886 --> 05:22:54.021
PORTER-COLOGNE. BUT THE

05:22:54.088 --> 05:22:55.422
SENATOR'S RIGHT THAT HERE WHAT

05:22:55.489 --> 05:22:57.324
WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS INCLUDE

05:22:57.391 --> 05:22:59.760
THOSE PROTECTIONS FOR NEXUS

05:22:59.827 --> 05:23:01.428
WATERS. BECAUSE WITHOUT 601,

05:23:01.495 --> 05:23:02.663
THEY WILL NOT GET THE CLEAN

05:23:02.730 --> 05:23:03.864
WATER PROTECTIONS THAT THEY'VE

05:23:03.931 --> 05:23:05.165
HAD FOR OVER 50 YEARS. THEY WILL

05:23:05.232 --> 05:23:07.034
GO DOWN TO THE STATE LEVEL,

05:23:07.101 --> 05:23:08.902
WHICH IS NOT AS ADEQUATE AS THE

05:23:08.969 --> 05:23:09.937
CLEAN WATER. WHEN YOU SAY

05:23:10.003 --> 05:23:10.704
PROTECTION, IT'S REALLY

05:23:10.771 --> 05:23:11.672
ENFORCEMENT, RIGHT? SO

05:23:11.739 --> 05:23:12.406
ENFORCEMENT, ENFORCEMENT

05:23:12.473 --> 05:23:14.108
PENALTIES, THINGS LIKE THAT, THE

05:23:14.174 --> 05:23:16.410
PROCESS STANDARDS THAT ARE IN

05:23:16.477 --> 05:23:18.445
PERMITS, PERMIT TERMS, WHAT A

05:23:18.512 --> 05:23:19.913
PERMIT LOOKS LIKE, HOW MUCH

05:23:19.980 --> 05:23:21.749
MONITORING IS REQUIRED. IS THE

05:23:21.815 --> 05:23:23.584
REPORTING PUBLIC OR

05:23:23.650 --> 05:23:24.752
CONFIDENTIAL. ALL OF THAT STUFF

05:23:24.818 --> 05:23:25.886
IS REQUIRED UNDER THE CLEAN

05:23:25.953 --> 05:23:28.122
WATER ACT AND IS NOT REQUIRED

05:23:28.188 --> 05:23:28.756
UNDER PORTER-COLOGNE. SO THOSE

05:23:28.822 --> 05:23:30.190
ARE IMPORTANT. THAT MAKES SENSE

05:23:30.257 --> 05:23:31.859
TO ME. AND I GUESS TO THE

05:23:31.925 --> 05:23:33.060
OPPOSITION. I THINK THAT THE

05:23:33.127 --> 05:23:34.762
AUTHOR HAS GONE A BIG WAY IN

05:23:34.828 --> 05:23:35.763
TAKING THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF

05:23:35.829 --> 05:23:37.131
ACTION OUT. AND I THINK THAT

05:23:37.197 --> 05:23:40.067
THAT WAS A BIG OPPOSITION POINT.

05:23:40.134 --> 05:23:40.567
HE HE TOOK IT OUT. HE

05:23:40.634 --> 05:23:41.702
SUBSTITUTED IT WITH PUBLIC

05:23:41.769 --> 05:23:43.203
PROSECUTORIAL AUTHORITY BECAUSE

05:23:43.270 --> 05:23:44.805
AS HE MADE THE POINT, I THINK

05:23:44.872 --> 05:23:46.607
IT'S TRUE. THE STATE WATER BOARD

05:23:46.673 --> 05:23:47.674
DOESN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO

05:23:47.741 --> 05:23:49.176
ACTUALLY OVERSEE THE

05:23:49.243 --> 05:23:50.144
ADMINISTRATION OF THIS. AND NOW

05:23:50.210 --> 05:23:51.945
YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE PUBLIC

05:23:52.012 --> 05:23:52.746
PROSECUTORIAL AUTHORITY SHOULD

05:23:52.813 --> 05:23:55.215
NOT BE THERE. AND I GUESS I'M A

05:23:55.282 --> 05:23:55.916
LITTLE CONFUSED BECAUSE UNDER

05:23:55.983 --> 05:23:57.751
THE CLEAN WATER ACT, THERE'S A

05:23:57.818 --> 05:23:58.986
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.

05:23:59.052 --> 05:24:00.087
CITIZENS CAN ACTUALLY ENFORCE

05:24:00.154 --> 05:24:01.321
IT. AND HE IS ACTUALLY, I THINK,

05:24:01.388 --> 05:24:02.790
WATERED THIS BILL DOWN, NO PUN

05:24:02.856 --> 05:24:04.958
INTENDED, TO WHERE NOW THAT YOU

05:24:05.025 --> 05:24:07.161
DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT

05:24:07.227 --> 05:24:08.896
ANYMORE. SO WE ARE LEFT WITH, I

05:24:08.962 --> 05:24:10.464
GUESS, AN OPPOSITION THAT THAT

05:24:10.531 --> 05:24:11.999
HAS SORT OF MOVED THE GOALPOSTS

05:24:12.065 --> 05:24:13.967
ON HIM. AND I GUESS I UNDERSTAND

05:24:14.034 --> 05:24:14.701
THAT YOU'RE SAYING, WELL, THE

05:24:14.768 --> 05:24:16.069
STATE WATER BOARD SHOULD JUST

05:24:16.136 --> 05:24:17.571
HANDLE IT, BUT THE DATA RIGHT

05:24:17.638 --> 05:24:20.808
NOW IS JUST VERY AGAINST THAT,

05:24:20.874 --> 05:24:22.276
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT THE

05:24:22.342 --> 05:24:23.544
PROTECTIONS WILL BE THERE IF WE

05:24:23.610 --> 05:24:25.913
LET THE STATE WATER BOARD DO IT.

05:24:25.979 --> 05:24:27.147
SO WHAT AM I MISSING? I MEAN, DO

05:24:27.214 --> 05:24:29.783
YOU WANT THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF

05:24:29.850 --> 05:24:30.350
ACTION, OR DO YOU WANT THE

05:24:30.417 --> 05:24:31.652
PUBLIC PROSECUTORIAL AUTHORITY?

05:24:31.718 --> 05:24:32.920
BECAUSE I THINK THOSE ARE THE

05:24:32.986 --> 05:24:33.921
TWO OPTIONS THAT MAKE SENSE. SO

05:24:33.987 --> 05:24:36.557
HERE'S HOW I WOULD ANSWER THAT.

05:24:36.623 --> 05:24:38.358
THE DATA THAT WAS INCLUDED IN

05:24:38.425 --> 05:24:41.228
THE ANALYSIS IS FROM FISCAL YEAR

05:24:41.295 --> 05:24:43.697
2324, PRIOR TO THE LEGISLATURE

05:24:43.764 --> 05:24:46.300
PROVIDING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES

05:24:46.366 --> 05:24:47.501
FOR ENFORCEMENT. THAT'S ONE

05:24:47.568 --> 05:24:49.303
POINT. SO I THINK THERE'S VALUE

05:24:49.369 --> 05:24:51.038
IN LOOKING AT HOW ENFORCEMENT

05:24:51.104 --> 05:24:52.840
CHANGED WITH THOSE ADDITIONAL

05:24:52.906 --> 05:24:54.708
RESOURCES. THE SECOND POINT THAT

05:24:54.775 --> 05:24:57.244
I WOULD MAKE IS IT'S UNCLEAR TO

05:24:57.311 --> 05:24:59.813
ME FROM THAT DATA WHETHER OR NOT

05:24:59.880 --> 05:25:01.815
THE 70% WERE NO ENFORCEMENT

05:25:01.882 --> 05:25:04.318
ACTION WAS TAKEN. IS LOOKING AT

05:25:04.384 --> 05:25:07.287
WHETHER THERE WAS NO FINES OR

05:25:07.354 --> 05:25:10.090
PENALTIES ISSUED VERSUS

05:25:10.157 --> 05:25:11.892
ABSOLUTELY NO ACTION BECAUSE YOU

05:25:11.959 --> 05:25:13.994
CAN WHAT WHAT THE WATER BOARD'S

05:25:14.061 --> 05:25:16.563
POLICY IS, IS TO GO OUT AND

05:25:16.630 --> 05:25:18.732
FIRST WORK WITH SOMEONE WHO THEY

05:25:18.799 --> 05:25:20.701
FIND IN VIOLATION TO BRING THEM

05:25:20.767 --> 05:25:22.636
BACK INTO COMPLIANCE. AND IT'S

05:25:22.703 --> 05:25:25.205
UNCLEAR WHETHER OR NOT THAT DATA

05:25:25.272 --> 05:25:28.842
RECOGNIZES THAT INFORMAL

05:25:28.909 --> 05:25:31.411
COLLABORATION VERSUS AND DOESN'T

05:25:31.478 --> 05:25:32.813
COUNT THAT AS AN ENFORCEMENT

05:25:32.880 --> 05:25:33.914
ACTION, BECAUSE THEY JUST

05:25:33.981 --> 05:25:36.717
REACHED OUT AND WORKED WITH THE

05:25:36.783 --> 05:25:38.185
VIOLATOR AND SOLVED THE PROBLEM

05:25:38.252 --> 05:25:39.987
WITHOUT TAKING A FORMAL ACTION.

05:25:40.053 --> 05:25:43.991
AND SO THAT THE 70% MAY BE KIND

05:25:44.057 --> 05:25:46.827
OF MASKING THAT. SO THOSE ARE

05:25:46.894 --> 05:25:48.528
THE TWO POINTS THAT I THINK ARE

05:25:48.595 --> 05:25:49.696
IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE. AND THE

05:25:49.763 --> 05:25:52.332
OTHER THING I WILL RAISE AS WELL

05:25:52.399 --> 05:25:53.700
IS, YOU KNOW, WE APPRECIATE THE

05:25:53.767 --> 05:25:54.835
COMMITTEE CONSULTANT FOR

05:25:54.902 --> 05:25:56.003
PROVIDING THE LINK AND THE

05:25:56.069 --> 05:25:57.671
ANALYSIS AND HAD A CHANCE TO

05:25:57.738 --> 05:25:59.273
REVIEW THAT. THERE'S NO CONTEXT

05:25:59.339 --> 05:26:01.174
PROVIDED FOR THAT NUMBER. AND IT

05:26:01.241 --> 05:26:05.212
IS VERY COMMON FOR A REGULATORY

05:26:05.279 --> 05:26:06.613
AND ENFORCEMENT ARM OF A

05:26:06.680 --> 05:26:09.149
REGULATORY AGENCY TO FOCUS ITS

05:26:09.216 --> 05:26:11.318
RESOURCES WHERE ENFORCE YOU GET

05:26:11.385 --> 05:26:13.353
THE MOST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK OR

05:26:13.420 --> 05:26:14.521
THE MOST EGREGIOUS TYPES OF

05:26:14.588 --> 05:26:15.555
VIOLATIONS. SO THERE'S NO

05:26:15.622 --> 05:26:16.790
INFORMATION ON THERE. DID

05:26:16.857 --> 05:26:17.858
SOMEBODY MISS A REPORTING

05:26:17.925 --> 05:26:20.060
REQUIREMENT BY A DAY? WAS IT A

05:26:20.127 --> 05:26:21.128
WAS IT DE MINIMIS SOME SORT OF

05:26:21.194 --> 05:26:23.297
DE MINIMIS VIOLATION. YOU KNOW,

05:26:23.363 --> 05:26:25.032
THE SAME KIND OF RATIONALE WHY

05:26:25.098 --> 05:26:27.100
YOU WOULDN'T POLICE DON'T GO

05:26:27.167 --> 05:26:28.602
AROUND PENALIZING PEOPLE THAT GO

05:26:28.669 --> 05:26:30.771
26 AND A 25 MILE AN HOUR ZONE.

05:26:30.837 --> 05:26:33.640
SO THAT INFORMATION IS NOT THAT

05:26:33.707 --> 05:26:36.910
CONTEXT IS NOT PROVIDED THERE.

05:26:36.977 --> 05:26:38.679
AND I THINK THE ONLY OTHER THING

05:26:38.745 --> 05:26:40.881
TO ADD TO IS THE 26 PIS THAT

05:26:40.948 --> 05:26:42.883
WERE APPROVED JUST LAST YEAR.

05:26:42.950 --> 05:26:44.551
THOSE ARE PAID FOR BY THE

05:26:44.618 --> 05:26:47.187
REGULATED COMMUNITY. SO THAT IS

05:26:47.254 --> 05:26:48.822
INCREASED PERMIT FEES FOR THE

05:26:48.889 --> 05:26:50.324
REGULATED COMMUNITY TO PAY FOR

05:26:50.390 --> 05:26:51.758
THOSE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS. AND

05:26:51.825 --> 05:26:54.494
SO NOW WE'RE SAYING WITHOUT ANY,

05:26:54.561 --> 05:26:55.829
YOU KNOW, ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE,

05:26:55.896 --> 05:26:57.798
THAT THAT IS NOW SOMEHOW

05:26:57.864 --> 05:26:59.199
INSUFFICIENT, THAT WE'RE GOING

05:26:59.266 --> 05:27:01.401
TO CREATE MORE ENFORCEMENT

05:27:01.468 --> 05:27:03.603
AUTHORITY TO LOCAL PROSECUTORS

05:27:03.670 --> 05:27:06.139
THAT THAT HAVE NEVER ENFORCED

05:27:06.206 --> 05:27:06.740
PORTER-COLOGNE BEFORE. AND SO

05:27:06.807 --> 05:27:08.508
THERE IS A QUESTION AS TO

05:27:08.575 --> 05:27:09.309
WHETHER THEY'RE THE SUBJECT

05:27:09.376 --> 05:27:10.844
MATTER EXPERTS THAT SHOULD BE

05:27:10.911 --> 05:27:11.845
LEADING THE CHARGE ON

05:27:11.912 --> 05:27:12.846
ENFORCEMENT. FAIR ENOUGH. AND

05:27:12.913 --> 05:27:14.314
THOSE ARE THOSE ARE ACTUALLY

05:27:14.381 --> 05:27:15.649
VALID RESPONSES. I APPRECIATE

05:27:15.716 --> 05:27:17.451
THAT. I'M JUST GOING TO LEAVE IT

05:27:17.517 --> 05:27:18.218
WITH THIS OBVIOUSLY VERY

05:27:18.285 --> 05:27:19.086
COMPLICATED BILL. IT'S NOT

05:27:19.152 --> 05:27:20.854
PERFECT YET. I THINK THE AUTHOR

05:27:20.921 --> 05:27:21.822
IS RECOGNIZED THAT. I KNOW THAT

05:27:21.888 --> 05:27:24.024
THERE ARE STILL SIGNIFICANT

05:27:24.091 --> 05:27:25.092
AMENDMENTS, AND I KNOW THAT ONE

05:27:25.158 --> 05:27:26.059
OF ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS IS

05:27:26.126 --> 05:27:27.627
HOPEFULLY GOING TO ADDRESS SOME

05:27:27.694 --> 05:27:29.062
OF THE CONCERNS FROM

05:27:29.129 --> 05:27:30.897
AGRICULTURE. AND I THINK THAT

05:27:30.964 --> 05:27:33.033
THE AG INDUSTRY, I DON'T THINK

05:27:33.100 --> 05:27:34.101
ALL INDUSTRIES ARE CREATED

05:27:34.167 --> 05:27:36.036
EQUAL. AND I THINK UNDER THIS

05:27:36.103 --> 05:27:36.903
BILL, I AM MOST CONCERNED ABOUT

05:27:36.970 --> 05:27:38.739
HOW IT'S GOING TO AFFECT SOME OF

05:27:38.805 --> 05:27:41.141
THE CONCERNS FROM AG, BECAUSE I

05:27:41.208 --> 05:27:42.175
THINK THOSE ARE REAL CONCERNS

05:27:42.242 --> 05:27:43.844
THAT AFFECT ALL OF US AND OUR

05:27:43.910 --> 05:27:45.245
FOOD SUPPLY AND HOW THAT

05:27:45.312 --> 05:27:46.680
INDUSTRY IS GOING TO OPERATE

05:27:46.747 --> 05:27:47.981
GOING FORWARD. I KNOW THE AUTHOR

05:27:48.048 --> 05:27:49.883
IS WORKING VERY DILIGENTLY,

05:27:49.950 --> 05:27:51.151
DILIGENTLY ON THAT, AND I TRUST

05:27:51.218 --> 05:27:52.753
THAT YOU GUYS WILL FIND A

05:27:52.819 --> 05:27:53.887
LANDING PLACE. SO I'M GOING TO

05:27:53.954 --> 05:27:55.989
VOTE FOR IT TODAY. BUT I, I

05:27:56.056 --> 05:27:57.457
THINK THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO

05:27:57.524 --> 05:27:58.492
HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHERE

05:27:58.558 --> 05:28:00.060
THIS ENDS UP. AND I APPRECIATE

05:28:00.127 --> 05:28:00.994
WHAT YOU'RE DOING. APPRECIATE

05:28:01.061 --> 05:28:02.162
THE OPPOSITION. SO THANK YOU.

05:28:02.229 --> 05:28:03.697
THANK YOU JOHN. THANK YOU. THANK

05:28:03.764 --> 05:28:05.966

05:28:06.033 --> 05:28:10.570
YOU, MR. CHAIR. THANK YOU FOR

05:28:10.637 --> 05:28:12.606
BRINGING THIS TO OUR ATTENTION.

05:28:12.672 --> 05:28:15.776
I AM NOTING THAT AS THE

05:28:15.842 --> 05:28:17.577
OPPOSITION INDICATED, I HAVE THE

05:28:17.644 --> 05:28:18.979
SAME DOCUMENT HERE THAT THE

05:28:19.046 --> 05:28:21.481
STATE WATER RESOURCES BOARD

05:28:21.548 --> 05:28:24.684
QUOTE AGAIN, DOES NOT THIS

05:28:24.751 --> 05:28:26.987
ACTION BY THE COURTS DOES NOT

05:28:27.054 --> 05:28:29.022
WEAKEN, DOES NOT WEAKEN

05:28:29.089 --> 05:28:30.891
CALIFORNIA'S CALIFORNIA'S MORE

05:28:30.957 --> 05:28:33.060
STRINGENT WETLAND PROTECTIONS,

05:28:33.126 --> 05:28:33.994
THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY

05:28:34.061 --> 05:28:35.629
GENERAL'S OFFICE SAID AT THE

05:28:35.695 --> 05:28:37.264
TIME OF THE COURT DECISION.

05:28:37.330 --> 05:28:39.132
CALIFORNIA HAS ADOPTED STRINGENT

05:28:39.199 --> 05:28:40.901
WETLAND REGULATIONS THAT WILL

05:28:40.967 --> 05:28:43.270
CONTINUE TO SAFEGUARD OUR

05:28:43.336 --> 05:28:44.571
WETLANDS AS FEDERAL PROTECTIONS

05:28:44.638 --> 05:28:48.241
ARE SHRINKING. SO YOU READ

05:28:48.308 --> 05:28:51.745
THOSE, YOU KNOW THAT I'M I'M

05:28:51.812 --> 05:28:53.947
TAKEN BY THE OPPOSITION THAT

05:28:54.014 --> 05:28:55.916
LINED THE MICROPHONE STAND THERE

05:28:55.982 --> 05:28:57.451
FROM OUR AGRICULTURAL INTERESTS,

05:28:57.517 --> 05:28:58.952
JUST LIKE MY COLLEAGUE JUST

05:28:59.019 --> 05:29:01.855
MENTIONED. IT'S EASY FOR US TO

05:29:01.922 --> 05:29:03.423
SIT HERE AND THINK, WELL, YES,

05:29:03.490 --> 05:29:04.825
WE ALL BELIEVE IN CLEAN WATER

05:29:04.891 --> 05:29:06.660
AND IT SHOULD BE MORE AND MORE

05:29:06.726 --> 05:29:08.728
AND MORE AT THE CONSEQUENCE. YOU

05:29:08.795 --> 05:29:09.329
TALK TO AGRICULTURE INTERESTS

05:29:09.396 --> 05:29:10.030
AND I DON'T REPRESENT

05:29:10.097 --> 05:29:11.131
AGRICULTURE INTERESTS. I JUST

05:29:11.198 --> 05:29:12.999
TALK TO THEM. AND HOW

05:29:13.066 --> 05:29:14.334
CONSTRAINED, CONSTRAINED,

05:29:14.401 --> 05:29:16.169
CONSTRAINED LAWS, LAWS, LAWS,

05:29:16.236 --> 05:29:17.537
REGULATIONS, REGULATIONS IN A

05:29:17.604 --> 05:29:19.906
HIGHLY COMPLEX PART OF OUR LAWS.

05:29:19.973 --> 05:29:21.708
AND I'M NO EXPERT ON IT. I'M

05:29:21.775 --> 05:29:24.211
JUST LOOKING AT IT FROM HOW THE

05:29:24.277 --> 05:29:25.345
BREADBASKET OF THE WORLD STARTS

05:29:25.412 --> 05:29:27.047
IN CALIFORNIA. WE WANT TO

05:29:27.114 --> 05:29:29.282
PROTECT OUR WATERS, BUT AT THE

05:29:29.349 --> 05:29:30.750
EXPENSE OF WHAT? I MEAN, WE JUST

05:29:30.817 --> 05:29:32.018
HAD DEBATE YESTERDAY ON THE

05:29:32.085 --> 05:29:33.553
FLOOR ON HOUSING AND HOW

05:29:33.620 --> 05:29:35.722
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS HAVE

05:29:35.789 --> 05:29:37.023
SLOWED HOUSING. AND WE'RE IN A

05:29:37.090 --> 05:29:40.560
HOUSING CRISIS, I AM CONCERNED,

05:29:40.627 --> 05:29:42.028
I SHUDDER TO THINK WHAT WE'RE

05:29:42.095 --> 05:29:43.663
DOING TO OUR AGRICULTURAL

05:29:43.730 --> 05:29:45.298
INDUSTRY. I KNOW A LOT OF LANDS

05:29:45.365 --> 05:29:46.900
ARE FALLOW AND THEY'RE GOING TO

05:29:46.967 --> 05:29:48.301
BE TURNED INTO SOLAR FARMS. I

05:29:48.368 --> 05:29:49.669
JUST BECAUSE THEY DON'T GET

05:29:49.736 --> 05:29:52.272
ENOUGH WATER. SO BEFORE WE JUST

05:29:52.339 --> 05:29:54.474
THINK THAT WE'RE RIGHTEOUS

05:29:54.541 --> 05:29:56.276
ENVIRONMENTALISTS, I REALLY AM

05:29:56.343 --> 05:29:57.744
CONCERNED ABOUT THE BUSINESS

05:29:57.811 --> 05:29:59.179
IMPACT, AGRICULTURE, IMPACT OF

05:29:59.246 --> 05:30:00.881
THE FARMERS AND RANCHERS AND THE

05:30:00.947 --> 05:30:02.816
WATER COMPANIES. WHAT ARE WE

05:30:02.883 --> 05:30:07.454
DOING IN CALIFORNIA AT THE

05:30:07.521 --> 05:30:09.156
WHAT'S THE EXPRESSION? THE

05:30:09.222 --> 05:30:10.624
PROBLEM OF PERFECTION IS THAT

05:30:10.690 --> 05:30:12.092
YOU DON'T GET ANYTHING. I MEAN,

05:30:12.159 --> 05:30:14.261
WE CAN'T BE ALWAYS STRIVING TO

05:30:14.327 --> 05:30:16.429
BE THE PERFECT, PERFECT,

05:30:16.496 --> 05:30:18.064
PERFECT, PERFECT, AND TO DESTROY

05:30:18.131 --> 05:30:19.900
THE VERY ENTITIES THAT MAKE OUR

05:30:19.966 --> 05:30:21.701
STATE SO SUCCESSFUL OR SHOULD BE

05:30:21.768 --> 05:30:23.937
SO SUCCESSFUL. SO I CAN'T

05:30:24.004 --> 05:30:26.072
SUPPORT IT. BUT IF SOMEONE COULD

05:30:26.139 --> 05:30:27.874
SHOW ME THAT OUR WATERWAYS, OUR

05:30:27.941 --> 05:30:30.143
NEXUS WATERWAYS ARE POLLUTED,

05:30:30.210 --> 05:30:32.345
ARE CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE

05:30:32.412 --> 05:30:33.813
ENVIRONMENT, I HAVE NOT SEEN THE

05:30:33.880 --> 05:30:35.015
DATA. SEND IT TO ME, SENATOR.

05:30:35.081 --> 05:30:37.551
I'D BE HAPPY TO REVIEW IT. I

05:30:37.617 --> 05:30:39.052
HAVEN'T SEEN IT NOR HEARD ABOUT

05:30:39.119 --> 05:30:41.421
IT. SO BEFORE WE START CHARGING

05:30:41.488 --> 05:30:43.723
UP THIS MOUNTAIN TO BE THE BEST

05:30:43.790 --> 05:30:45.725
IN THE WORLD ON OUR NEXUS

05:30:45.792 --> 05:30:46.993
WATERWAYS, I'D LIKE TO SEE THE

05:30:47.060 --> 05:30:48.795
DATA. THANK YOU. YEAH, WELL, SO

05:30:48.862 --> 05:30:51.064
REMEMBER, THE REASON WHY THERE'S

05:30:51.131 --> 05:30:53.200
NOT A LOT OF THAT DATA IS

05:30:53.266 --> 05:30:53.800
BECAUSE WE ENJOYED THE

05:30:53.867 --> 05:30:55.235
PROTECTIONS OF THE CLEAN WATER

05:30:55.302 --> 05:30:58.205
ACT. THE FULL PROTECTIONS UNTIL

05:30:58.271 --> 05:30:59.639
JUST A YEAR OR TWO AGO. AND I

05:30:59.706 --> 05:31:01.308
WILL SAY, YOU KNOW, THE WATER

05:31:01.374 --> 05:31:02.842
BOARD HAS SAID A BUNCH OF

05:31:02.909 --> 05:31:04.411
DIFFERENT THINGS ON THIS TOPIC.

05:31:04.477 --> 05:31:06.079
THEY DID SAY WHAT YOU JUST SAID.

05:31:06.146 --> 05:31:08.215
THEY HOWEVER, THEY ALSO IN THEIR

05:31:08.281 --> 05:31:10.116
RECENT BCP WROTE THE WATER

05:31:10.183 --> 05:31:11.818
BOARDS HAVE ALREADY SEEN AN

05:31:11.885 --> 05:31:12.819
IMPACT OF EXISTING ENFORCEMENT

05:31:12.886 --> 05:31:14.387
CASES ACROSS SEVERAL PROGRAM

05:31:14.454 --> 05:31:15.388
AREAS WHERE THEY HAVE WHERE

05:31:15.455 --> 05:31:16.957
THERE HAVE BEEN JURISDICTIONAL

05:31:17.023 --> 05:31:19.359
ARGUMENTS RAISED, AS WELL AS AN

05:31:19.426 --> 05:31:20.193
INCREASE OF DISCHARGERS CLAIMING

05:31:20.260 --> 05:31:21.595
EXEMPTION FROM INDUSTRIAL AND

05:31:21.661 --> 05:31:22.295
CONSTRUCTION STORMWATER

05:31:22.362 --> 05:31:23.363
PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS BASED ON

05:31:23.430 --> 05:31:24.798
THE POST SACKETT RULING

05:31:24.864 --> 05:31:26.299
DEFINITION OF WATERS OF THE

05:31:26.366 --> 05:31:27.567
UNITED STATES, THE WATER BOARD'S

05:31:27.634 --> 05:31:28.735
AUTHORITY TO PROTECT WATER THAT

05:31:28.802 --> 05:31:30.303
DO NOT QUALIFY AS WATERS OF THE

05:31:30.370 --> 05:31:31.738
UNITED STATES NOW ARE LESS

05:31:31.805 --> 05:31:32.806
EFFICIENT AND MORE LABOR

05:31:32.872 --> 05:31:34.174
INTENSIVE. SO THAT WAS IN THE

05:31:34.241 --> 05:31:37.377
MOST RECENT VCP. SO THERE'S A

05:31:37.444 --> 05:31:39.646
YOU KNOW, CERTAINLY THERE'S A

05:31:39.713 --> 05:31:41.181
DIFFERENT EVEN SET OF MESSAGING

05:31:41.248 --> 05:31:42.182
FROM THE WATER BOARD THAN WHAT

05:31:42.249 --> 05:31:43.316
WAS MENTIONED. OBVIOUSLY, THEY

05:31:43.383 --> 05:31:45.252
WANTED TO PUT THEIR STRONGEST

05:31:45.318 --> 05:31:47.988
FOOT FORWARD IN THE IMMEDIATE

05:31:48.054 --> 05:31:48.822
AFTERMATH OF THE OF THE RULING.

05:31:48.888 --> 05:31:51.124
BUT THEY'RE ALSO, YOU KNOW,

05:31:51.191 --> 05:31:52.559
POINTING TO A LOT OF CHALLENGES

05:31:52.626 --> 05:31:53.927
ASSOCIATED WITH THE POST-SOVIET

05:31:53.994 --> 05:31:55.328
WORLD AND THEIR WORK. THE OTHER

05:31:55.395 --> 05:31:57.497
THING I'LL SAY IS ON

05:31:57.564 --> 05:31:58.932
AGRICULTURE, THE BILL ONLY

05:31:58.999 --> 05:32:01.434
IMPACTS POINT SOURCE DISCHARGE

05:32:01.501 --> 05:32:04.004
INTO SPECIFIC SURFACE WATER,

05:32:04.070 --> 05:32:06.539
SUCH DRAINAGE PIPE INTO CREEK

05:32:06.606 --> 05:32:07.974
OR, YOU KNOW, SO THAT SORT OF

05:32:08.041 --> 05:32:09.075
THING, BY REGULATING THESE

05:32:09.142 --> 05:32:12.512
DISCHARGES AS IF THEY WERE STILL

05:32:12.579 --> 05:32:13.146
FEDERALLY PROTECTED. AND, YOU

05:32:13.213 --> 05:32:15.148
KNOW, MANY OF THE OF THE KEY

05:32:15.215 --> 05:32:16.316
AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS THAT WE

05:32:16.383 --> 05:32:18.385
KNOW ARE ALREADY NOT CONSIDERED

05:32:18.451 --> 05:32:19.986
POINT SOURCE POLLUTION, YOU

05:32:20.053 --> 05:32:21.554
KNOW, STORMWATER RUNOFF FROM

05:32:21.621 --> 05:32:22.756
FIELDS, CATTLE, MOST CATTLE

05:32:22.822 --> 05:32:27.427
GRAZING, FOR EXAMPLE, SO, SO OR

05:32:27.494 --> 05:32:29.129
IF THE WATER DRAINS INTO DRY

05:32:29.195 --> 05:32:32.465
LAND, THEY ARE NOT IMPACTED BY,

05:32:32.532 --> 05:32:34.634
BY OUR BILL. SO THE OTHER THING

05:32:34.701 --> 05:32:36.569
IS WE ALSO RECENTLY AMENDED THE

05:32:36.636 --> 05:32:38.638
BILL TO CLARIFY A CONSISTENCY

05:32:38.705 --> 05:32:40.373
WITH THE STATE WETLANDS POLICY,

05:32:40.440 --> 05:32:41.741
WHICH GOVERNS CERTAIN DREDGE AND

05:32:41.808 --> 05:32:43.476
FILL PERMITS THAT AGRICULTURAL

05:32:43.543 --> 05:32:44.644
OPERATIONS MAY NEED. SO, YOU

05:32:44.711 --> 05:32:46.413
KNOW, AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS

05:32:46.479 --> 05:32:48.982
THAT, THAT, THAT, THAT DID

05:32:49.049 --> 05:32:50.850
PREVIOUSLY NEED A FEDERAL

05:32:50.917 --> 05:32:52.986
PERMIT, THEY WOULD CONTINUE TO

05:32:53.053 --> 05:32:54.421
BE HELD TO EQUIVALENT STANDARDS

05:32:54.487 --> 05:32:57.957
UNDER THE BILL. BUT, YOU KNOW,

05:32:58.024 --> 05:32:59.426
AGAIN, THESE ARE THESE ARE THESE

05:32:59.492 --> 05:33:00.860
FOLKS WERE COMPLYING WITH THE

05:33:00.927 --> 05:33:04.431
CWA BEFORE. WE'RE NOT ADDING ANY

05:33:04.497 --> 05:33:06.700
ADDITIONAL NEW REQUIREMENTS. YOU

05:33:06.766 --> 05:33:07.934
KNOW, TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

05:33:08.001 --> 05:33:09.235
CHANGES FROM PRIVATE RIGHT OF

05:33:09.302 --> 05:33:10.637
ACTION TO PUBLIC PROSECUTION,

05:33:10.704 --> 05:33:11.905
YOU KNOW, AGAIN, IF YOU WANT TO

05:33:11.971 --> 05:33:13.907
TALK SHOP ABOUT HOW TO MAKE THAT

05:33:13.973 --> 05:33:15.175
BETTER ON THE ENFORCEMENT SIDE,

05:33:15.241 --> 05:33:17.010
HAPPY TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION.

05:33:17.077 --> 05:33:19.245
BUT, BUT BUT, YOU KNOW, IF THERE

05:33:19.312 --> 05:33:20.814
TRULY IS ANYTHING IN HERE WHERE

05:33:20.880 --> 05:33:22.982
WE'RE ASKING FOR MORE THAN WHAT

05:33:23.049 --> 05:33:26.086
THE CLEAN WATER ACT ASKS FOR IT,

05:33:26.152 --> 05:33:28.321
I'M, YOU KNOW, SO OPEN TO

05:33:28.388 --> 05:33:29.989
SCALING THAT BACK OR RUNNING,

05:33:30.056 --> 05:33:31.191
YOU KNOW, PULLING THAT BACK

05:33:31.257 --> 05:33:32.292
BECAUSE WE'RE REALLY NOT TRYING

05:33:32.359 --> 05:33:35.762
TO GO BEYOND THE SCOPE OF, OF,

05:33:35.829 --> 05:33:39.432
OF, OF PROTECTING WATERS THAT

05:33:39.499 --> 05:33:40.600
WERE, YOU KNOW, WERE PROTECTED.

05:33:40.667 --> 05:33:41.968
PRETTY. SACKETT. OKAY. ALL

05:33:42.035 --> 05:33:43.536
RIGHT. THANK YOU FOR THAT

05:33:43.603 --> 05:33:45.505
EXPLANATION. I DO APPRECIATE IT.

05:33:45.572 --> 05:33:46.706
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

05:33:46.773 --> 05:33:47.240
SO, MEMBER ASSEMBLY MEMBER

05:33:47.307 --> 05:33:51.378
PAPAN. SO I'M GOING TO BIFURCATE

05:33:51.444 --> 05:33:53.146
THIS, IF YOU WILL, PLEASE I LOVE

05:33:53.213 --> 05:33:54.814
BIFURCATION. TODAY WE'RE ONLY

05:33:54.881 --> 05:33:55.882
TALKING ABOUT THE ENFORCEMENT

05:33:55.949 --> 05:33:57.183
PROVISION. AND AS I UNDERSTAND

05:33:57.250 --> 05:33:59.853
IT, WHILE WE MAY BE ADDING THE

05:33:59.919 --> 05:34:01.788
LOCAL PART OF IT, THERE IS A

05:34:01.855 --> 05:34:04.357
THIRD DAY, 30 DAY NOTICE TO THE

05:34:04.424 --> 05:34:05.759
AG TO TAKE IT OR NOT TAKE IT

05:34:05.825 --> 05:34:07.260
RIGHT. SO THAT WILL MAYBE KEEP

05:34:07.327 --> 05:34:09.062
THINGS STILL AT THE AG LEVEL I

05:34:09.129 --> 05:34:10.997
DON'T KNOW. SO I WILL BE

05:34:11.064 --> 05:34:12.966
SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BASED

05:34:13.032 --> 05:34:14.968
ON THE ENFORCEMENT. AND I'M OKAY

05:34:15.034 --> 05:34:16.669
WITH THE INFLATIONARY INCREASES

05:34:16.736 --> 05:34:18.772
TO THE PENALTIES. I DON'T KNOW

05:34:18.838 --> 05:34:20.373
THAT THAT'S TOTALLY UNREASONABLE

05:34:20.440 --> 05:34:21.541
GIVEN THE EXPENSE OF

05:34:21.608 --> 05:34:23.443
ENFORCEMENT, BUT I'M GOING TO

05:34:23.510 --> 05:34:24.944
REVISIT ALL OF THE OTHER STUFF

05:34:25.011 --> 05:34:26.346
AS IT RELATES, MR. BOTHWELL, TO

05:34:26.413 --> 05:34:29.115
THE NEXUS WATERS IN TÌM, WHERE

05:34:29.182 --> 05:34:30.650
I'LL SEE YOU THERE. SO I JUST

05:34:30.717 --> 05:34:33.553
WANTED YOU TO KNOW NOT TO BE TOO

05:34:33.620 --> 05:34:34.187
DECEIVED BY THE VOTE TODAY. AND

05:34:34.254 --> 05:34:38.758
I APPRECIATE. THE CONCERNS WE

05:34:38.825 --> 05:34:41.261
MIGHT HAVE OF ITS IMPACT ON OUR

05:34:41.327 --> 05:34:43.830
AG OR OTHER WATER AGENCIES THAT

05:34:43.897 --> 05:34:45.398
ARE REALLY STRUGGLING. AND, YOU

05:34:45.465 --> 05:34:47.534
KNOW, I SEE THOSE FOLKS ALL THE

05:34:47.600 --> 05:34:48.568
TIME. SO WE'LL TAKE ANOTHER LOOK

05:34:48.635 --> 05:34:51.938
AT IT DOWN THE ROAD. YEAH. AND I

05:34:52.005 --> 05:34:53.606
WANT TO SAY TO THE WORLD THAT,

05:34:53.673 --> 05:34:55.074
THAT THE SUPREME COURT UNDER

05:34:55.141 --> 05:34:56.443
SACKETT, EVERY SINGLE MEMBER

05:34:56.509 --> 05:34:57.811
RAISED CONCERNS WITH HOW

05:34:57.877 --> 05:34:59.012
EXPANSIVE THE CLEAN WATER ACT

05:34:59.078 --> 05:35:01.581
DEFINITION HAD BEEN BEFORE.

05:35:01.648 --> 05:35:02.816
OBVIOUSLY, THERE WERE MEMBERS

05:35:02.882 --> 05:35:05.919
THAT WERE LESS, YOU KNOW, THAT

05:35:05.985 --> 05:35:08.354
THAT DIDN'T LIKE HOW MUCH

05:35:08.421 --> 05:35:09.756
SACKETT RULED THOSE THOSE

05:35:09.823 --> 05:35:10.957
DEFINITIONS BACK. SO I THINK

05:35:11.024 --> 05:35:12.792
WHEN WE GO TO TÌM, I'M I'M

05:35:12.859 --> 05:35:13.793
PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN TWO

05:35:13.860 --> 05:35:16.296
OF THE CONCURRENCE, CONCURRENCE

05:35:16.362 --> 05:35:18.898
OPINIONS THAT WERE SIGNED ON TO

05:35:18.965 --> 05:35:21.000
BY KIND OF A MIX OF LIBERALS AND

05:35:21.067 --> 05:35:23.102
CONSERVATIVES TO HELP US THINK

05:35:23.169 --> 05:35:25.638
ABOUT HOW WE MIGHT WANT TO

05:35:25.705 --> 05:35:29.275
NARROW THE WATERS DEFINITIONS.

05:35:29.342 --> 05:35:31.077
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS?

05:35:31.144 --> 05:35:34.447
DO WE HAVE A MOTION, A MOTION IN

05:35:34.514 --> 05:35:37.684
A SECOND? SENATOR, I WANT TO

05:35:37.750 --> 05:35:39.786
THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, THIS IS ONE

05:35:39.853 --> 05:35:41.821
OF THE BILLS THAT I WAS JUMPED

05:35:41.888 --> 05:35:43.523
ON EARLIER AS A COAUTHOR, WHICH

05:35:43.590 --> 05:35:44.691
I DON'T OFTENTIMES DO WHEN I

05:35:44.757 --> 05:35:46.793
KNOW A BILL MAY COME TO MY

05:35:46.860 --> 05:35:47.594
JURISDICTION AND COME TO THIS

05:35:47.660 --> 05:35:48.862
COMMITTEE. HOWEVER, I THINK THIS

05:35:48.928 --> 05:35:50.630
IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT

05:35:50.697 --> 05:35:51.264
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION BILLS

05:35:51.331 --> 05:35:53.266
THAT WE HAVE MOVING THROUGH THE

05:35:53.333 --> 05:35:55.702
LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR. I MEAN, I

05:35:55.768 --> 05:35:56.402
HAVE THE ATTENTION OF OTHERS,

05:35:56.469 --> 05:35:59.205
BUT TO YOUR POINT, I THINK IT'S

05:35:59.272 --> 05:36:00.874
SUCH AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT

05:36:00.940 --> 05:36:03.810
BACKSTOP. IT'S NOT CREATING, YOU

05:36:03.877 --> 05:36:05.278
KNOW, AND TO PARTICULARLY TO

05:36:05.345 --> 05:36:06.913
YOUR POINT, TO THE OPPOSITION,

05:36:06.980 --> 05:36:08.748
THE INTENTION IS NOT TO CREATE

05:36:08.815 --> 05:36:11.718
NEW RESTRICTIONS, BUT REALLY

05:36:11.784 --> 05:36:13.853
JUST DO WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS DONE

05:36:13.920 --> 05:36:15.688
TO THE TO THE VICE CHAIRS POINT.

05:36:15.755 --> 05:36:17.457
BUT YOU CAN'T REALLY POINT OUT

05:36:17.524 --> 05:36:18.925
EXAMPLES QUITE YET BECAUSE WE'VE

05:36:18.992 --> 05:36:20.493
HAD THE PROTECTION FOR FIVE

05:36:20.560 --> 05:36:21.961
DECADES OF THE CLEAN WATER ACT.

05:36:22.028 --> 05:36:24.063
WE DON'T WANT TO COME BACK IN 2

05:36:24.130 --> 05:36:25.832
OR 3 YEARS AND HAVE EXAMPLES TO

05:36:25.899 --> 05:36:27.967
POINT TO AND THEN ACT RIGHT. WE

05:36:28.034 --> 05:36:29.469
WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ACT NOW TO

05:36:29.536 --> 05:36:32.705
MAINTAIN THE GREAT QUALITY, THE

05:36:32.772 --> 05:36:33.673
WATER THAT WE HAVE AND

05:36:33.740 --> 05:36:35.842
PROTECTIONS THAT WE'VE WE'VE

05:36:35.909 --> 05:36:37.710
ENJOYED FOR MANY, MANY DECADES.

05:36:37.777 --> 05:36:40.980
AND TO YOUR POINT AS WELL, THIS

05:36:41.047 --> 05:36:42.682
IS NOT ABOUT THIS WOULD NOT

05:36:42.749 --> 05:36:45.251
ALLOW FOR KIND OF PARALLEL

05:36:45.318 --> 05:36:46.185
PROCESSES. IF THERE'S AN

05:36:46.252 --> 05:36:48.688
INVESTIGATION, A LOCAL AGENCY OR

05:36:48.755 --> 05:36:51.291
DISTRICT IS ALREADY TAKING OR IS

05:36:51.357 --> 05:36:54.527
UNDERWAY, THEN THAT THAT WILL GO

05:36:54.594 --> 05:36:56.262
THROUGH AND THAT WILL, YOU KNOW

05:36:56.329 --> 05:36:58.197
WELL THAT THAT WILL BE ALLOWED

05:36:58.264 --> 05:36:59.933
TO GO FORWARD WITHOUT ANOTHER

05:36:59.999 --> 05:37:02.368
PROCESS OR ANOTHER INVESTIGATION

05:37:02.435 --> 05:37:04.671
SUBSEQUENTLY BEING BROUGHT OR IN

05:37:04.737 --> 05:37:05.905
PARALLEL. AND SO I THINK YOUR

05:37:05.972 --> 05:37:07.206
AMENDMENTS, I MEAN, YOU'VE DONE

05:37:07.273 --> 05:37:08.641
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK ON

05:37:08.708 --> 05:37:10.810
THIS, AS HAS YOUR STAFF FROM THE

05:37:10.877 --> 05:37:12.078
CO-SPONSORS, AND I'M VERY

05:37:12.145 --> 05:37:13.146
GRATEFUL FOR THAT. I THINK THAT

05:37:13.212 --> 05:37:15.048
CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE, I

05:37:15.114 --> 05:37:16.516
DON'T THINK ANYONE CAN ARGUE,

05:37:16.583 --> 05:37:17.083
INCLUDING OPPOSITION. IT'S

05:37:17.150 --> 05:37:17.817
IMPROVED THE BILL QUITE

05:37:17.884 --> 05:37:19.018
SIGNIFICANTLY TO DEAL WITH A LOT

05:37:19.085 --> 05:37:20.520
OF THE OPPOSITION CONCERNS. BUT

05:37:20.587 --> 05:37:22.922
AT THE END OF THE DAY, THIS IS

05:37:22.989 --> 05:37:25.124
ABOUT US AS LEGISLATORS DOING

05:37:25.191 --> 05:37:27.594
JUST MAINTAINING CALIFORNIA'S

05:37:27.660 --> 05:37:30.597
ROLE IN PROTECTING OUR WATER AND

05:37:30.663 --> 05:37:32.365
PROTECTING IT AS WE DID AND HAVE

05:37:32.432 --> 05:37:33.866
DONE UNDER THE CLEAN WATER ACT.

05:37:33.933 --> 05:37:35.602
IT'S NOT THAT MUCH MORE

05:37:35.668 --> 05:37:36.903
COMPLICATED THAN THAT. ALTHOUGH

05:37:36.970 --> 05:37:38.404
THE DETAILS CAN GET SOMEWHAT

05:37:38.471 --> 05:37:39.305
COMPLICATED. I THINK S TÌM WILL

05:37:39.372 --> 05:37:42.041
DEAL WITH A LOT OF THE A LOT OF

05:37:42.108 --> 05:37:42.742
THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'RE

05:37:42.809 --> 05:37:43.209
TALKING ABOUT HAVING

05:37:43.276 --> 05:37:44.911
CONVERSATIONS YOU'RE HAVING. BUT

05:37:44.978 --> 05:37:46.646
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD

05:37:46.713 --> 05:37:47.480
OVERCOMPLICATE WHAT YOU'RE

05:37:47.547 --> 05:37:49.115
TRYING TO DO HERE. I THINK IT'S

05:37:49.182 --> 05:37:50.283
A REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE OF

05:37:50.350 --> 05:37:51.918
LEGISLATION FOR US TO CONTINUE

05:37:51.985 --> 05:37:54.687
THE STATUS QUO OF CALIFORNIA,

05:37:54.754 --> 05:37:56.055
MAINTAINING ITS ROLE IN

05:37:56.122 --> 05:37:57.123
PROTECTING OUR WATERS. AND SO

05:37:57.190 --> 05:37:59.325
WITH THAT, WOULD YOU LIKE TO

05:37:59.392 --> 05:38:00.960
CLOSE? I COULDN'T HAVE SAID IT

05:38:01.027 --> 05:38:02.061

EXCELLENT STAFF FOR ITS WORK ON

THE BILL. SO THIS BILL IS ABOUT

05:39:38.658 --> 05:39:39.392
TRYING TO ADD CONSUMER

05:39:39.459 --> 05:39:40.026
PROTECTIONS FOR CAR PURCHASERS

05:39:40.093 --> 05:39:44.163
AND CAR LEASERS BY CODIFYING THE

05:39:44.230 --> 05:39:45.965
THERE'S SOME SIMILAR PARALLELS,

05:39:46.032 --> 05:39:47.567
THOUGH. WE'RE CLOSER TO BEING

DONE ON THIS ONE. BUT WE'RE

05:39:49.902 --> 05:39:51.204
BASICALLY SEEKING TO CODIFY THE

05:39:51.270 --> 05:39:52.038

BEEN WORKING EXTENSIVELY WITH

THE OPPOSITION. WE'VE HAD A

05:39:57.777 --> 05:39:58.845
GREAT CHAT WITH THEM WHILE WE

05:40:05.718 --> 05:40:07.487
AMENDMENTS IN THE IN THE

05:40:07.553 --> 05:40:08.621
ANALYSIS. I'M HAPPY TO GO

05:40:08.688 --> 05:40:11.124
THROUGH THEM. WE'VE JUST AGREED

05:40:11.190 --> 05:40:12.792
TO SOME ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS TO

05:40:12.859 --> 05:40:13.926
NARROW SOME OF THE BILLS RECORD

05:40:13.993 --> 05:40:14.994
RETENTION REQUIREMENTS, WHILE

05:40:15.061 --> 05:40:16.629
STILL ENSURING THAT DEALERS KEEP

05:40:16.696 --> 05:40:17.697
SUFFICIENT RECORDS TO

05:40:17.764 --> 05:40:18.264
DEMONSTRATE COMPLIANCE. YOU

05:40:18.331 --> 05:40:19.665
KNOW, JUST TO GIVE YOU SOME

05:40:19.732 --> 05:40:20.733
BACKGROUND ON THE BILL, LATE

05:40:20.800 --> 05:40:23.069
LAST YEAR, THE COURT OF APPEALS

05:40:23.136 --> 05:40:23.736
FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT OVERTURNED

05:40:23.803 --> 05:40:25.304
THE CARS RULE, BUT ONLY ON

05:40:25.371 --> 05:40:26.706
ADMINISTRATIVE GROUNDS. WE HAD

05:40:26.773 --> 05:40:27.740
MANY CALIFORNIANS FILING

05:40:27.807 --> 05:40:29.509
COMMENTS IN FAVOR OF THE FTC'S

05:40:29.575 --> 05:40:30.810
RULE THAT THE BILL CODIFIES,

05:40:30.877 --> 05:40:32.278
INCLUDING FORMER AUTO SALES

05:40:32.345 --> 05:40:33.079
PERSONNEL AND CONSUMERS WHO

05:40:33.146 --> 05:40:34.547
PERSONALLY EXPERIENCE AUTO

05:40:34.614 --> 05:40:36.449
SCAMS. EVEN OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL

05:40:36.516 --> 05:40:39.085
FILED SOME COMMENTS. SO THIS IS

05:40:39.152 --> 05:40:40.553
ULTIMATELY ABOUT REALLY TRYING

05:40:40.620 --> 05:40:42.889
TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE BASIC

05:40:42.955 --> 05:40:43.890
CONSUMER COMPLAINTS. THESE ARE

05:40:43.956 --> 05:40:45.625
CASES WHERE DEALERS ARE NOT

05:40:45.691 --> 05:40:46.926
BEING FULLY TRANSPARENT. PEOPLE

05:40:46.993 --> 05:40:48.194
GO IN THINKING THEY'RE GOING TO

05:40:48.261 --> 05:40:49.862
BUY A $30,000 CAR BECAUSE THAT'S

05:40:49.929 --> 05:40:52.498
WHAT'S BEING ADVERTISED. AND

05:40:52.565 --> 05:40:53.199
THEN THEY WALK OUT, HAVING SPENT

05:40:53.266 --> 05:40:54.033
38,000 BEING TOLD THAT THIS WAS

05:40:54.100 --> 05:40:55.701
AN AD, YOU KNOW, REQUIRED ADD ON

05:40:55.768 --> 05:40:56.903
AND ETC. SO WE'RE LOOKING TO

05:40:56.969 --> 05:40:59.672
MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS, THAT THE

05:40:59.739 --> 05:41:01.574
FOLKS SELLING THE CARS ARE NOT

05:41:01.641 --> 05:41:02.241
MISREPRESENTING THE PRICE OF THE

05:41:02.308 --> 05:41:04.043
CAR. WE REQUIRE TRANSPARENCY ON

05:41:04.110 --> 05:41:06.078
THE FULL TOTAL PRICE AND THE

05:41:06.145 --> 05:41:07.246
TOTAL PAYMENTS. IF, FOR EXAMPLE,

05:41:07.313 --> 05:41:08.815
THERE IS AN ADD ON ONTO THE CAR

05:41:08.881 --> 05:41:10.850
THAT CANNOT BE REMOVED, THAT IS,

05:41:10.917 --> 05:41:12.351
THAT'S PART OF THE PRICE. THAT'S

05:41:12.418 --> 05:41:13.753
NOT AN OPTIONAL THING IF IT

05:41:13.820 --> 05:41:15.521
CAN'T BE REMOVED. SO THAT SHOULD

05:41:15.588 --> 05:41:16.522
BE INCLUDED IN THE ADVERTISED

05:41:16.589 --> 05:41:17.990
PRICE. YOU CAN OF COURSE MENTION

05:41:18.057 --> 05:41:19.959
THAT YOU GET THIS ADDITIONAL ADD

05:41:20.026 --> 05:41:20.827
ON, BUT BUT THAT YOU SHOULDN'T

05:41:20.893 --> 05:41:22.728
BE PRETENDING AS THOUGH THAT'S

05:41:22.795 --> 05:41:23.896
THAT'S THAT'S OPTIONAL. WE WANT

05:41:23.963 --> 05:41:25.765
YOU KNOW, SO WE WANT DEALERS TO

05:41:25.832 --> 05:41:26.499
BE TRANSPARENT ABOUT ADD ON

05:41:26.566 --> 05:41:28.067
SERVICES OR FEATURES THAT ARE

05:41:28.134 --> 05:41:28.901
OPTIONAL AND PROHIBIT THEM FROM

05:41:28.968 --> 05:41:30.636
CHARGING FOR ADD ONS THAT WILL

05:41:30.703 --> 05:41:32.004
NOT BENEFIT THE CONSUMER. THERE

05:41:32.071 --> 05:41:33.339
HAVE BEEN SOME, YOU KNOW, NOT

05:41:33.406 --> 05:41:34.941
NOT FREQUENT BUT SOME RARE CASES

05:41:35.007 --> 05:41:37.043
OF, YOU KNOW, SOMEONE SELLING A

05:41:37.109 --> 05:41:39.345
PURCHASER OF AN ELECTRIC CAR,

05:41:39.412 --> 05:41:40.646
OIL CHANGES, YOU KNOW, CERTAIN

05:41:40.713 --> 05:41:42.515
TYPES OF SERVICING THAT IS NOT

05:41:42.582 --> 05:41:43.649
APPLICABLE TO AN ELECTRIC CAR,

05:41:43.716 --> 05:41:45.418
YOU KNOW, SO STUFF LIKE THAT,

05:41:45.484 --> 05:41:47.153
YOU KNOW, AND AGAIN, THE VAST

05:41:47.220 --> 05:41:48.921
MAJORITY OF CAR DEALERS DON'T DO

05:41:48.988 --> 05:41:50.323
THAT KIND OF THING. BUT WE DON'T

05:41:50.389 --> 05:41:52.158
WANT THAT TO BE HAPPENING. YOU

05:41:52.225 --> 05:41:54.026
KNOW, WE, WE, WE ALSO WANT TO

05:41:54.093 --> 05:41:54.760
PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL

05:41:54.827 --> 05:41:56.495
PROTECTIONS FOR MEMBERS OF THE

05:41:56.562 --> 05:41:57.029
MILITARY AND VETERANS BY

05:41:57.096 --> 05:41:57.930
PROHIBITING DEALERS FROM

05:41:57.997 --> 05:41:59.098
MISREPRESENTING AFFILIATION WITH

05:41:59.165 --> 05:42:00.433
THE US GOVERNMENT, STATE

05:42:00.499 --> 05:42:01.601
GOVERNMENT, THE DEPARTMENT OF

05:42:01.667 --> 05:42:03.035
DEFENSE. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME

05:42:03.102 --> 05:42:05.204
SOME CASES IN THAT IN THAT

05:42:05.271 --> 05:42:07.874
CATEGORY AS WELL. SO THAT'S

05:42:07.940 --> 05:42:09.108
THAT'S WHAT THE BILL IS

05:42:09.175 --> 05:42:10.610
ULTIMATELY ABOUT. AND I JUST

05:42:10.676 --> 05:42:12.511
WANT TO SAY HOW MUCH I

05:42:12.578 --> 05:42:13.112
APPRECIATE THE WORK I'VE BEEN

05:42:13.179 --> 05:42:15.581
DOING WITH WITH ROSEMARIE FROM

05:42:15.648 --> 05:42:17.116
CONSUMERS FOR AUTO RELIABILITY

05:42:17.183 --> 05:42:18.150
AND SAFETY. AND WE ALSO HAVE

05:42:18.217 --> 05:42:19.785
CHUCK MARSHALL HERE TODAY, WHO'S

05:42:19.852 --> 05:42:20.987
AN EXPERIENCED ATTORNEY

05:42:21.053 --> 05:42:21.854
REPRESENTING CONSUMERS WHO'VE

05:42:21.921 --> 05:42:23.556
BEEN MISLED AND DEFRAUDED IN

05:42:23.623 --> 05:42:26.325
MANY CASES. AND THEY'RE HERE TO

05:42:26.392 --> 05:42:28.527
SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL.

05:42:28.594 --> 05:42:29.929
THANK YOU, MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS.

05:42:29.996 --> 05:42:31.397
THANK YOU. AND GOOD AFTERNOON.

05:42:31.464 --> 05:42:32.665
MY NAME IS CHUCK MARSHALL. I'M

05:42:32.732 --> 05:42:33.833
HERE TO TESTIFY AS A PROUD

05:42:33.900 --> 05:42:36.502
SUPPORTER OF SB 766 AND ON

05:42:36.569 --> 05:42:37.303
BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL

05:42:37.370 --> 05:42:37.970
ASSOCIATION OF CONSUMER

05:42:38.037 --> 05:42:39.405
ADVOCATES AS WELL. I'VE BEEN A

05:42:39.472 --> 05:42:40.840
CONSUMER PROTECTION ATTORNEY FOR

05:42:40.907 --> 05:42:42.608
27 YEARS, AND FOR THE PAST 12,

05:42:42.675 --> 05:42:43.843
MY PRACTICE IN WALNUT CREEK HAS

05:42:43.910 --> 05:42:45.745
FOCUSED SOLELY ON PROTECTING

05:42:45.811 --> 05:42:46.479
CONSTITUENTS FROM ALL OVER THE

05:42:46.545 --> 05:42:49.448
STATE FROM BAD USED CAR DEALS.

05:42:49.515 --> 05:42:50.616
I'M HERE TO EXPRESS STRONG

05:42:50.683 --> 05:42:52.885
SUPPORT FOR SB 766. THE PROBLEM

05:42:52.952 --> 05:42:54.754
IT ADDRESSES ISN'T THEORETICAL.

05:42:54.820 --> 05:42:56.022
IT'S SOMETHING I SEE EVERY DAY.

05:42:56.088 --> 05:42:57.723
WHEN SOMEONE BUYS A CAR THAT

05:42:57.790 --> 05:42:58.925
BREAKS DOWN WITHIN DAYS. IT'S

05:42:58.991 --> 05:43:00.626
NOT JUST INCONVENIENT, IT'S

05:43:00.693 --> 05:43:01.761
DEVASTATING. THIS BILL CAN STOP

05:43:01.827 --> 05:43:03.329
THAT BEFORE IT STARTS. LET ME

05:43:03.396 --> 05:43:05.731
GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. MY CLIENT,

05:43:05.798 --> 05:43:07.066
ALEJANDRO BOLANOS, BOUGHT A

05:43:07.133 --> 05:43:08.467
CHEVY SUBURBAN FROM A FRANCHISE

05:43:08.534 --> 05:43:10.136
DEALER IN CONCORD. THEY TOLD HIM

05:43:10.202 --> 05:43:11.771
IT PASSED CHEVROLET'S CERTIFIED

05:43:11.837 --> 05:43:13.973
PRE-OWNED PROGRAM, WHICH IS 172

05:43:14.040 --> 05:43:16.075
POINT INSPECTION CHECKLIST. MAKE

05:43:16.142 --> 05:43:17.777
SURE IT'S RELIABLE AND IT'S

05:43:17.843 --> 05:43:18.711
SAFE. HE BOUGHT IT FOR HIS

05:43:18.778 --> 05:43:20.379
GROWING FAMILY. HIS WIFE WAS

05:43:20.446 --> 05:43:21.714
PREGNANT AT THE TIME. WITHIN

05:43:21.781 --> 05:43:23.616
DAYS, THE CAR BEGAN TO FAIL. THE

05:43:23.683 --> 05:43:24.684
TRANSMISSION LEAKED, THE FUEL

05:43:24.750 --> 05:43:26.419
SYSTEM FAILED, FAULTY SUSPENSION

05:43:26.485 --> 05:43:27.820
AND THE THIRD ROW MIDDLE SEAT

05:43:27.887 --> 05:43:29.055
BELT WAS ENTIRELY MISSING. THIS

05:43:29.121 --> 05:43:31.190
IS WHERE HE'S GOING TO PUT HIS

05:43:31.257 --> 05:43:32.224
NEW CHILD. THIS WASN'T BAD LUCK.

05:43:32.291 --> 05:43:34.193
THIS WAS A VEHICLE THAT NEVER

05:43:34.260 --> 05:43:35.194
SHOULD HAVE BEEN CERTIFIED,

05:43:35.261 --> 05:43:36.429
NEVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN SOLD. IT

05:43:36.495 --> 05:43:37.797
NEVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN DRIVEN BY

05:43:37.863 --> 05:43:40.132
A FAMILY WITH A NEWBORN ON THE

05:43:40.199 --> 05:43:41.667
WAY. UNDER SB 766, HE'D HAVE A

05:43:41.734 --> 05:43:43.869
NEW RIGHT TO RETURN THAT CAR AND

05:43:43.936 --> 05:43:45.805
GET A REFUND MINUS A REASONABLE

05:43:45.871 --> 05:43:46.973
RESTOCKING FEE. AND THAT'S NOT

05:43:47.039 --> 05:43:48.774
AN ISOLATED CASE. I GET OVER 100

05:43:48.841 --> 05:43:50.376
CALLS A MONTH, AND DOZENS OF

05:43:50.443 --> 05:43:51.944
THOSE ARE FROM PEOPLE WHOSE CARS

05:43:52.011 --> 05:43:53.579
BREAK DOWN A DAY OR TWO AFTER

05:43:53.646 --> 05:43:56.382
PURCHASE. YOU KNOW, THEY FIND

05:43:56.449 --> 05:43:57.683
UNWANTED ADD ONS HAVE BEEN SLID

05:43:57.750 --> 05:43:59.018
INTO THE DEAL AT THE LAST

05:43:59.085 --> 05:44:00.186
MINUTE, AND THEY REALIZE

05:44:00.252 --> 05:44:01.120
FINANCING TERMS CHANGED WHEN

05:44:01.187 --> 05:44:02.755
THEY WEREN'T LOOKING. THOSE

05:44:02.822 --> 05:44:03.689
PEOPLE WOULD BE PROTECTED BY

05:44:03.756 --> 05:44:05.257
THIS BILL. NOW, THE OPPONENTS

05:44:05.324 --> 05:44:07.126
SAY THIS IS GOING TO INCREASE

05:44:07.193 --> 05:44:08.728
LITIGATION. I'M IN THIS FIELD.

05:44:08.794 --> 05:44:10.129
IT'S GOING TO REDUCE IT. IF

05:44:10.196 --> 05:44:12.231
DEALERS FOLLOW THIS LAW, MOST OF

05:44:12.298 --> 05:44:13.165
THESE PROBLEMS WILL NEVER

05:44:13.232 --> 05:44:14.734
HAPPEN. CONSUMERS LIKE MR.

05:44:14.800 --> 05:44:16.736
BOLANOS, YOU WON'T NEED A LAWYER

05:44:16.802 --> 05:44:19.138
LIKE ME. I WILL NEVER GET THOSE

05:44:19.205 --> 05:44:19.905
CALLS BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO HAVE

05:44:19.972 --> 05:44:21.841
A TOOL TO FIX THE PROBLEM BEFORE

05:44:21.907 --> 05:44:23.275
IT SPIRALS OUT OF CONTROL. AND

05:44:23.342 --> 05:44:24.910
THIS BILL ACTUALLY PUTS MORE A

05:44:24.977 --> 05:44:25.978
LITTLE BIT MORE POWER WHERE IT

05:44:26.045 --> 05:44:27.947
BELONGS, WHICH IS BACK INTO THE

05:44:28.014 --> 05:44:29.315
HANDS OF THE BUYERS. AND THAT'S

05:44:29.382 --> 05:44:30.950
WHY SB 76 SIX MATTERS FROM WHERE

05:44:31.017 --> 05:44:32.785
I SIT. CASE AFTER CASE, TRYING

05:44:32.852 --> 05:44:34.854
TO CLEAN UP THE DAMAGE CONSUMERS

05:44:34.920 --> 05:44:35.755
NEED MORE THAN AFTER THE FACT.

05:44:35.821 --> 05:44:37.189
HELP FROM SOMEONE LIKE ME. THEY

05:44:37.256 --> 05:44:39.091
NEED THE POWER TO ENFORCE THESE

05:44:39.158 --> 05:44:40.459
RIGHTS BEFORE THE HARM GOES TOO

05:44:40.526 --> 05:44:42.495
DEEP. AND THAT'S WHY I URGE YOU

05:44:42.561 --> 05:44:44.697
TO VOTE AYE ON SB 766. THANK

05:44:44.764 --> 05:44:47.166
YOU. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR AND

05:44:47.233 --> 05:44:48.634

PRESIDENT OF CONSUMERS FOR AUTO

05:44:50.569 --> 05:44:52.238
RELIABILITY AND SAFETY. AND WE

05:44:52.304 --> 05:44:54.740
APPLAUD SENATOR ALLEN FOR HIS

05:44:56.909 --> 05:44:59.178
MEASURE. AND WE'D ALSO LIKE TO

05:44:59.245 --> 05:45:00.946
THANK COUNSEL FOR THE COMMITTEE,

05:45:01.013 --> 05:45:03.582
FOR THE EXCELLENT ANALYSIS. AND

05:45:03.649 --> 05:45:06.185
AS STATED IN THE ANALYSIS, SB

05:45:06.252 --> 05:45:08.020
766 WILL HELP ADDRESS THE NUMBER

05:45:08.087 --> 05:45:09.188
ONE SOURCE OF CONSUMER

05:45:09.255 --> 05:45:11.057
COMPLAINTS TO STATE AND LOCAL

05:45:11.123 --> 05:45:12.658
CONSUMER PROTECTION AGENCIES.

05:45:12.725 --> 05:45:16.962
CAR BUYING. IT'S ALMOST LIKE A

05:45:17.029 --> 05:45:19.865
CLICHE. ACCORDING TO THE FEDERAL

05:45:19.932 --> 05:45:21.400
TRADE COMMISSION, THE CARS RULE

05:45:21.467 --> 05:45:23.569
WAS PROJECTED TO SAVE AMERICAN

05:45:23.636 --> 05:45:27.106
CAR BUYERS ABOUT $3.4 BILLION A

05:45:27.173 --> 05:45:29.775
YEAR AND ANOTHER 72,000,000

05:45:29.842 --> 05:45:31.377
HOURS ANNUALLY THAT WOULD

05:45:31.444 --> 05:45:33.212
OTHERWISE BE SPENT HAGGLING OVER

05:45:33.279 --> 05:45:35.514
AND SHOPPING FOR CARS. THOUSANDS

05:45:35.581 --> 05:45:37.616
OF CALIFORNIANS, INCLUDING OUR

BACKING THE CARS RULE ON GROUNDS

05:45:45.858 --> 05:45:48.828
THAT IT'S NEEDED TO ADDRESS

05:45:48.894 --> 05:45:50.529
CONTINUING ONGOING RAMPANT FRAUD

05:45:50.596 --> 05:45:55.301
IN CAR BUYING, AND SB 766 WOULD

05:45:55.367 --> 05:45:58.003
GO BEYOND THE CARS RULE AND ALSO

05:45:58.070 --> 05:46:00.973
INCLUDE A THREE BUSINESS DAY

05:46:01.040 --> 05:46:03.909
RETURN OPTION. AND THAT IS SO

05:46:03.976 --> 05:46:05.978
IMPORTANT FOR USED CAR BUYERS

05:46:06.045 --> 05:46:07.746
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I'M SO OLD. I

05:46:07.813 --> 05:46:09.081
REMEMBER WHEN YOU USED TO BE,

05:46:09.148 --> 05:46:10.649
LIKE, ABLE TO LIFT THE HOOD AND

05:46:10.716 --> 05:46:12.751
KICK THE TIRES AND KNOW WHAT'S

05:46:12.818 --> 05:46:14.153
GOING ON WITH THE CAR. THOSE

05:46:14.220 --> 05:46:15.721
DAYS ARE LONG GONE. TODAY'S CARS

05:46:15.788 --> 05:46:18.224
ARE SO COMPLICATED. IT REALLY

05:46:18.290 --> 05:46:21.460
TAKES HAVING A SKILLED AUTO TECH

05:46:21.527 --> 05:46:23.262
WITH THE RIGHT EQUIPMENT, THE

05:46:23.329 --> 05:46:24.697
DIAGNOSTIC EQUIPMENT TO RUN THE

05:46:24.763 --> 05:46:26.198
ERROR CODES AND FIND OUT WHAT'S

05:46:26.265 --> 05:46:28.701
HAPPENING WITH THE CAR. AND LIKE

05:46:28.767 --> 05:46:30.503
ODOMETER FRAUD IS STILL VERY

05:46:30.569 --> 05:46:32.037
RAMPANT. IT'S REALLY HARD TO

05:46:32.104 --> 05:46:33.005
TELL IF THE ODOMETER HAS BEEN

05:46:33.072 --> 05:46:34.940
ROLLED BACK, BUT IF YOU GET A

05:46:35.007 --> 05:46:36.809
TECH TO LOOK AT IT, HE CAN TELL

05:46:36.876 --> 05:46:40.513
YOU HE OR SHE CAN TELL YOU RIGHT

05:46:40.579 --> 05:46:42.615
AWAY. AND A NUMBER OF CAR

05:46:42.681 --> 05:46:44.917
DEALERS ALREADY OFFER COOLING

05:46:44.984 --> 05:46:47.386

05:46:47.453 --> 05:46:51.290
HEARD, PEOPLE ARE PRETTY HAPPY

05:46:51.357 --> 05:46:54.326

05:46:57.096 --> 05:47:00.366

GOOD AFTERNOON, MR. CHAIR AND

05:48:00.125 --> 05:48:01.493
MEMBERS. ANTHONY SAMPSON HERE ON

05:48:01.560 --> 05:48:03.095
BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NEW CAR

05:48:03.162 --> 05:48:04.830
DEALERS ASSOCIATION, WE ARE IN

05:48:04.897 --> 05:48:06.265
AN OPPOSED, UNLESS AMENDED, ON

05:48:06.332 --> 05:48:08.367
THE BILL. LET ME JUST START BY

05:48:08.434 --> 05:48:11.270
THANKING THE CHAIR AND STAFF AS

05:48:11.337 --> 05:48:14.073
WELL. SHARON, IN PARTICULAR. I

05:48:14.139 --> 05:48:15.341
THINK THAT THE WAY THIS PROCESS

05:48:15.407 --> 05:48:16.709
HAS BEEN GOING FOR THE PAST

05:48:16.775 --> 05:48:18.344
SEVERAL WEEKS IS THE WAY THESE

05:48:18.410 --> 05:48:20.679
PROCESSES NEED TO GO, AND YOU

05:48:20.746 --> 05:48:22.881
GAVE US THE ABILITY AND SORT OF

05:48:22.948 --> 05:48:24.750
THE SPACE THAT WE NEEDED TO BE

05:48:24.817 --> 05:48:26.552
ABLE TO MAKE SOME PROGRESS,

05:48:26.619 --> 05:48:28.520
WHICH WE WHICH WE HAVE. I THINK

05:48:28.587 --> 05:48:30.222
IT'S FAIR TO BE UP HERE TO SAY

05:48:30.289 --> 05:48:31.724
THAT THE BILL THAT YOU ARE

05:48:31.790 --> 05:48:33.592
LOOKING AT IN FRONT OF YOU IS

05:48:33.659 --> 05:48:34.660
PROBABLY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

05:48:34.727 --> 05:48:36.495
OVERHAUL OF THE VEHICLE SALES

05:48:36.562 --> 05:48:37.763
AND LEASE TRANSACTION PROCESS

05:48:37.830 --> 05:48:40.199
THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN DECADES, IF

05:48:40.266 --> 05:48:42.935
NOT EVER. WE ARE NOT AT A POINT

05:48:43.002 --> 05:48:45.337
RIGHT NOW WHERE WE ARE PUSHING

05:48:45.404 --> 05:48:47.673
BACK OR OPPOSING ANY OF THE

05:48:47.740 --> 05:48:49.341
CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN THIS

05:48:49.408 --> 05:48:51.076
BILL, BUT RATHER WE ARE LOOKING

05:48:51.143 --> 05:48:53.045
AT WORKABILITY AND TO MAKE SURE

05:48:53.112 --> 05:48:55.247
THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE

05:48:55.314 --> 05:48:56.615
CAN IMPLEMENT IN A WAY THAT

05:48:56.682 --> 05:48:58.550
WORKS FOR BOTH DEALERS AS WELL

05:48:58.617 --> 05:49:03.555
AS CONSUMERS. SO IN TERMS OF THE

05:49:03.622 --> 05:49:04.590
PROTECTIONS THEMSELVES, AND I

05:49:04.657 --> 05:49:06.759
KNOW THEY WERE TALKED ABOUT THE

05:49:06.825 --> 05:49:08.060
RIGHT TO RETURN, I WANT TO TALK

05:49:08.127 --> 05:49:10.396
ABOUT HOW SIGNIFICANT THAT IS.

05:49:10.462 --> 05:49:13.198
TODAY. CONSUMERS HAVE A TWO DAY

05:49:13.265 --> 05:49:15.034
OPTION TO PURCHASE THE RIGHT TO

05:49:15.100 --> 05:49:17.569
RETURN THEIR VEHICLE, AND THEY

05:49:17.636 --> 05:49:20.606
HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT. SO WHAT WE

05:49:20.673 --> 05:49:22.941
ARE DOING IS WE ARE MAKING THAT

05:49:23.008 --> 05:49:24.677
FREE, AND THEN WE ARE ADDING A

05:49:24.743 --> 05:49:26.478
DAY. AND WHILE I APPRECIATE THAT

05:49:26.545 --> 05:49:27.946
THE SPONSORS HAVE TALKED ABOUT

05:49:28.013 --> 05:49:28.714
HOW ENTITIES ARE DOING THIS

05:49:28.781 --> 05:49:32.384
ALREADY, KEEP IN MIND THAT NCDA

05:49:32.451 --> 05:49:33.319
REPRESENTS PLENTY OF SMALL

05:49:33.385 --> 05:49:34.920
DEALERS. THIS IS NOT AN EASY

05:49:34.987 --> 05:49:36.955
THING TO DO, AND WE HAVE SOME

05:49:37.022 --> 05:49:38.824
WORK TO DO ON THAT ISSUE. PRICE

05:49:38.891 --> 05:49:40.025
TRANSPARENCY. THIS WAS SOMETHING

05:49:40.092 --> 05:49:41.226
THAT THE SENATOR RAISED AT THE

05:49:41.293 --> 05:49:43.796
INITIAL HEARING. WE THINK THAT

05:49:43.862 --> 05:49:45.197
WHAT WE'VE AGREED TO ON PRICE

05:49:45.264 --> 05:49:46.298
TRANSPARENCY IS GOOD FOR

05:49:46.365 --> 05:49:47.333
EVERYBODY, GOOD FOR DEALERS,

05:49:47.399 --> 05:49:48.867
GOOD FOR CONSUMERS TO ENSURE

05:49:48.934 --> 05:49:50.636
THAT THE PRICE THAT THEY SEE

05:49:50.703 --> 05:49:52.471
ONLINE IS MATCHING, THE PRICE

05:49:52.538 --> 05:49:55.274
THAT THEY COME AND SEE IN THE

05:49:55.341 --> 05:49:58.977
DEALERSHIP. ADD ONS WERE MAKING

05:49:59.044 --> 05:50:00.713
SURE THAT CONSUMERS AREN'T

05:50:00.779 --> 05:50:01.714
CONFUSED ABOUT ADD ONS AND

05:50:01.780 --> 05:50:04.016
WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE OPTIONAL.

05:50:04.083 --> 05:50:05.751
SO THERE ARE A WHOLE LOT OF

05:50:05.818 --> 05:50:07.853
STRONG CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN

05:50:07.920 --> 05:50:10.022
TERMS OF THE REMAINING ISSUES.

05:50:10.089 --> 05:50:12.291
LIKE I SAID, WE ARE NOT FOCUSED

05:50:12.358 --> 05:50:14.827
ON STRIKING CONSUMER PROTECTIONS

05:50:14.893 --> 05:50:16.462
AT THIS POINT. WE'RE LOOKING AT

05:50:16.528 --> 05:50:18.664
MAKING THEM MORE WORKABLE. THERE

05:50:18.731 --> 05:50:20.332
ARE THINGS LIKE THE EFFECTIVE

05:50:20.399 --> 05:50:21.867
DATE. THIS IS GOING TO TAKE A

05:50:21.934 --> 05:50:23.736
LONG TIME NOT ONLY TO IMPLEMENT,

05:50:23.802 --> 05:50:26.071
BUT TO EDUCATE DEALERS ON THESE

05:50:26.138 --> 05:50:29.441
NEW PROVISIONS, NEW FORMS, NEW

05:50:29.508 --> 05:50:30.576
ADVERTISING REQUIREMENTS. THIS

05:50:30.642 --> 05:50:31.643
IS NOT SOMETHING THEY'RE GOING

05:50:31.710 --> 05:50:33.212
TO BE ABLE TO DO OVERNIGHT. SO

05:50:33.278 --> 05:50:34.880
THE EFFECTIVE DATE IS VERY

05:50:34.947 --> 05:50:37.483
IMPORTANT. THE APPLICATION TO

05:50:37.549 --> 05:50:38.784
COMMERCIAL VEHICLE TRANSACTIONS.

05:50:38.851 --> 05:50:40.519
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WERE

05:50:40.586 --> 05:50:41.720
JUST TALKING ABOUT RIGHT OUTSIDE

05:50:41.787 --> 05:50:43.055
OF THIS ROOM. I THINK THAT

05:50:43.122 --> 05:50:44.289
THERE'S A WAY TO THREAD THE

05:50:44.356 --> 05:50:46.191
NEEDLE ON THAT ISSUE. THERE ARE

05:50:46.258 --> 05:50:48.060
A COUPLE OF SPECIFIED

05:50:48.127 --> 05:50:49.294
PROHIBITIONS, PROHIBITIONS THAT

05:50:49.361 --> 05:50:51.830
ARE VERY PROBLEMATIC. AND I

05:50:51.897 --> 05:50:52.965
THINK THAT THOSE NEED

05:50:53.031 --> 05:50:53.932
CLARIFYING. AND THEN, LIKE I

05:50:53.999 --> 05:50:55.734
SAID, RIGHT TO RETURN AGAIN, I

05:50:55.801 --> 05:50:57.603
THINK WE'LL GET THERE. WE

05:50:57.669 --> 05:50:58.237
APPRECIATE ALL THE HARD WORK AND

05:50:58.303 --> 05:51:00.272

YOU WERE GOING TO TAKE. AND SO I

05:52:53.986 --> 05:52:55.254
APPRECIATE THE DIALOG. I

05:52:55.320 --> 05:52:57.256
APPRECIATE THAT THAT THERE HAS

05:52:57.322 --> 05:52:58.090
BEEN AMENDMENTS. AND THIS IS A

05:52:58.156 --> 05:52:59.224
DIFFERENT BILL THAN ORIGINALLY

05:52:59.291 --> 05:53:01.159
IT WAS. AND IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE

05:53:01.226 --> 05:53:02.928
GOING TO GET TO AN EVEN BETTER

05:53:02.995 --> 05:53:04.363
PLACE. SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING

05:53:04.429 --> 05:53:06.064
YOUR BILL TODAY. AND I LOOK

05:53:06.131 --> 05:53:08.000
FORWARD TO THE OUTCOME. IT LOOKS

05:53:08.066 --> 05:53:10.135
LIKE EVENTUALLY YOU MIGHT GET

05:53:10.202 --> 05:53:11.436
EVERYBODY TO NEUTRAL. SO GOOD

05:53:11.503 --> 05:53:14.072
JOB. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

05:53:14.139 --> 05:53:16.208
PAPAN, I WOULD JUST CONCUR WITH

05:53:16.275 --> 05:53:18.377
ASSEMBLYMEMBER PACHECO. I THINK

05:53:18.443 --> 05:53:20.546
THE THREE DAYS IS GETTING IN THE

05:53:20.612 --> 05:53:21.947
REALM OF WHAT CAN WORK FOR

05:53:22.014 --> 05:53:23.749
FOLKS. JUST GOT TO FIGURE OUT IF

05:53:23.815 --> 05:53:24.816
THAT'S THREE BUSINESS DAYS OR

05:53:24.883 --> 05:53:26.385
REGULAR DAYS, RESTOCKING FEES,

05:53:26.451 --> 05:53:28.086
ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT

05:53:28.153 --> 05:53:29.922
MAKE IT PERHAPS MORE WORKABLE IF

05:53:29.988 --> 05:53:31.823
SOMEBODY JUST WANTS TO GO FOR

05:53:31.890 --> 05:53:33.926
THREE DAYS AND DRIVE A FANCY CAR

05:53:33.992 --> 05:53:35.928
AND PUTS A LOT OF MILES ON IT,

05:53:35.994 --> 05:53:36.929
YOU KNOW, THAT'S TOUGH ON

05:53:36.995 --> 05:53:38.864
INDUSTRY. SO I THINK, LIKE

05:53:38.931 --> 05:53:40.032
MEMBER PACHECO SAID, I THINK

05:53:40.098 --> 05:53:40.899
YOU'LL GET THERE. SO I

05:53:40.966 --> 05:53:44.636
APPRECIATE YOUR OPENNESS TO IT.

05:53:44.703 --> 05:53:47.105
YEAH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ZABIR SO I

05:53:47.172 --> 05:53:48.941
WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND

05:53:49.007 --> 05:53:51.076
ALSO THE OPPOSITION AS WELL. I

05:53:51.143 --> 05:53:52.878
MEAN, I THINK, YOU KNOW, ONE OF

05:53:52.945 --> 05:53:54.513
THE THINGS THAT ONE OF THE MOST

05:53:54.580 --> 05:53:55.914
SCARY THINGS OUT THERE IS BUYING

05:53:55.981 --> 05:53:57.783
A CAR, AND I KEEP BUYING. AND

05:53:57.849 --> 05:53:59.851
BUYING A USED CAR IS SCARIER

05:53:59.918 --> 05:54:02.220
THAN BUYING A NEW CAR. AND SO I

05:54:02.287 --> 05:54:03.155
UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT THIS

05:54:03.221 --> 05:54:05.123
IS. AND PROTECTING CONSUMERS AND

05:54:05.190 --> 05:54:06.658
ALSO APPRECIATE THAT THE

05:54:06.725 --> 05:54:07.593
OPPOSITION IS ACTUALLY NOT

05:54:07.659 --> 05:54:09.494
PUSHING BACK ON THE ON THE KEY

05:54:09.561 --> 05:54:10.529
CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN THIS

05:54:10.596 --> 05:54:12.764
BILL. I GUESS THE THING I WOULD

05:54:12.831 --> 05:54:14.833
SORT OF SAY IS I'VE TAKEN A

05:54:14.900 --> 05:54:16.368
QUICK LOOK AT SOME OF THE SOME

05:54:16.435 --> 05:54:17.936
OF THE ISSUES, AND I, I THINK

05:54:18.003 --> 05:54:19.605
THAT DELAYING THE EFFECTIVE DATE

05:54:19.671 --> 05:54:21.106
IS A IS A REASONABLE THING TO

05:54:21.173 --> 05:54:24.009
DO. AND SO I HOPE YOU'LL DO THAT

05:54:24.076 --> 05:54:24.676
BECAUSE I THINK YOU'VE GOT A LOT

05:54:24.743 --> 05:54:26.845
OF I MEAN, IF YOU THINK ABOUT

05:54:26.912 --> 05:54:28.513
THIS, THIS GOES INTO EFFECT

05:54:28.580 --> 05:54:29.648
SIGNED SOMETIME IN SEPTEMBER.

05:54:29.715 --> 05:54:30.616
IT'S A FEW MONTHS BEFORE THIS

05:54:30.682 --> 05:54:32.517
WOULD ALL HAVE TO BE IN PLACE.

05:54:32.584 --> 05:54:34.052
SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO PUSH

05:54:34.119 --> 05:54:36.088
THE EFFECTIVE DATE OFF. I THINK

05:54:36.154 --> 05:54:37.556
THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED

05:54:37.623 --> 05:54:39.691
RELATED TO COMMERCIAL

05:54:39.758 --> 05:54:41.193
TRANSACTIONS ARE REASONABLE. I

05:54:41.259 --> 05:54:43.762
MEAN, I, YOU KNOW, WHY WOULD YOU

05:54:43.829 --> 05:54:44.630
NEED ALL THESE KINDS OF

05:54:44.696 --> 05:54:46.198
DISCLOSURES FOR FLEET VEHICLE

05:54:46.264 --> 05:54:47.399
PURCHASES AND THAT KIND OF

05:54:47.466 --> 05:54:48.700
THING? AND THEN I THINK THE LAST

05:54:48.767 --> 05:54:51.303
THING I WOULD SAY IS I'VE TAKEN

05:54:51.370 --> 05:54:53.038
A LOOK AT WHAT THE OPPOSITION

05:54:53.105 --> 05:54:54.973
HAS ASKED FOR IN TERMS OF SOME

05:54:55.040 --> 05:54:58.810
OF THE PROHIBITIONS, AND I'M

05:54:58.877 --> 05:54:59.911
HOPING YOU'LL CONTINUE WORKING

05:54:59.978 --> 05:55:00.979
WITH THEM ON THAT. I THINK THERE

05:55:01.046 --> 05:55:02.848
ARE ANSWERS TO THOSE THAT DO NOT

05:55:02.914 --> 05:55:04.850
HURT THE CONSUMER, BUT MAKE IT.

05:55:04.916 --> 05:55:05.951
IN FACT, IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR

05:55:06.018 --> 05:55:07.686
THE CONSUMER IF IT WAS SORT OF

05:55:07.753 --> 05:55:10.722
FLESHED OUT A LITTLE BIT. AND SO

05:55:10.789 --> 05:55:12.758
FOR EXAMPLE, THE 1 TO 1784 C,

05:55:12.824 --> 05:55:14.059
WHERE THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT

05:55:14.126 --> 05:55:16.428
WHETHER OR NOT THERE COULD BE A

05:55:16.495 --> 05:55:16.962
MISREPRESENTATION ABOUT A

05:55:17.029 --> 05:55:18.764
PURCHASE OR LEASE, I UNDERSTAND.

05:55:18.830 --> 05:55:20.332
AND I BOUGHT CARS BEFORE WHERE

05:55:20.399 --> 05:55:21.466
ACTUALLY THE DEALER HAS

05:55:21.533 --> 05:55:22.868
BASICALLY SAID IF YOU'RE LEASING

05:55:22.934 --> 05:55:25.103
IT, THERE'S THIS SET OF

05:55:25.170 --> 05:55:26.038
PAYMENTS, AND IF YOU'RE

05:55:26.104 --> 05:55:27.572
PURCHASING IT, IT'S THIS SET OF

05:55:27.639 --> 05:55:29.675
PAYMENTS. I JUST SORT OF THINK

05:55:29.741 --> 05:55:31.810
THAT IT'S REASONABLE TO SORT OF

05:55:31.877 --> 05:55:33.512
FOCUS ON THAT ISSUE, BECAUSE

05:55:33.578 --> 05:55:34.846
THAT COULD BE PRESENTED AS PART

05:55:34.913 --> 05:55:36.848
OF THE TRANSACTION AND FIGURE

05:55:36.915 --> 05:55:38.717
OUT HOW YOU DEAL WITH THAT TO

05:55:38.784 --> 05:55:40.519
MAKE SURE THAT THE CONSUMER

05:55:40.585 --> 05:55:41.253
ACTUALLY KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE

05:55:41.319 --> 05:55:42.688
DOING. BUT I THINK THAT SOME OF

05:55:42.754 --> 05:55:44.222
THESE, SOME OF THESE MINOR

05:55:44.289 --> 05:55:45.490
ISSUES ARE ONES THAT I'M HOPING

05:55:45.557 --> 05:55:46.925
YOU'LL CONTINUE DEALING WITH.

05:55:46.992 --> 05:55:48.960
BUT ANYWAY, ON ON THE WHOLE, I

05:55:49.027 --> 05:55:50.929
THINK IT'S A GREAT BILL. I THINK

05:55:50.996 --> 05:55:52.064
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. AND I

05:55:52.130 --> 05:55:53.832
JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR

05:55:53.899 --> 05:55:55.734
BRINGING IT. I DO THINK IT'S

05:55:55.801 --> 05:55:56.201
REALLY SIGNIFICANT, A

05:55:56.268 --> 05:55:57.002
SIGNIFICANT BILL. AND I ACTUALLY

05:55:57.069 --> 05:55:59.004
WANT TO THANK THE OPPOSITION FOR

05:55:59.071 --> 05:56:00.338
ACTUALLY WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR

05:56:00.405 --> 05:56:02.074
ON, ESPECIALLY ON EMBRACING THE

05:56:02.140 --> 05:56:03.742
CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT ARE IN

05:56:03.809 --> 05:56:06.445
THE BILL. SO WITH THAT, I'LL BE

05:56:06.511 --> 05:56:07.079
SUPPORTING IT TODAY. ASSEMBLY

05:56:07.145 --> 05:56:08.280
MEMBER STEFANI, THANK YOU. JUST

05:56:08.346 --> 05:56:10.048
WANT TO ALIGN MY COMMENTS WITH

05:56:10.115 --> 05:56:11.416
THOSE OF THE OTHER ASSEMBLY

05:56:11.483 --> 05:56:12.651
MEMBERS THAT HAVE SPOKEN TODAY.

05:56:12.718 --> 05:56:13.952
THANK YOU FOR THIS IMPORTANT

05:56:14.019 --> 05:56:15.687
WORK FOR CONSUMER PROTECTION. I

05:56:15.754 --> 05:56:17.556
WANT TO THANK THE OPPOSITION

05:56:17.622 --> 05:56:18.323
TOO, BECAUSE IT SEEMS YOU'RE

05:56:18.390 --> 05:56:20.559
WORKING DILIGENTLY WITH THE

05:56:20.625 --> 05:56:21.960
AUTHOR TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT WE

05:56:22.027 --> 05:56:23.995
GET THIS MOVING TO A PLACE WHERE

05:56:24.062 --> 05:56:25.897
WE ARE PROTECTING CONSUMERS, AND

05:56:25.964 --> 05:56:28.133
I LOOK FORWARD TO SEE HOW THOSE

05:56:28.200 --> 05:56:29.968
COMMENTS CONTINUE. I MEAN, THE

05:56:30.035 --> 05:56:31.570
WORK CONTINUES. AND AGAIN, I'LL

05:56:31.636 --> 05:56:32.804
BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY.

05:56:32.871 --> 05:56:34.539
THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

05:56:34.606 --> 05:56:37.442
BAUER-KAHAN. WELL, I ALSO WANT

05:56:37.509 --> 05:56:38.910
TO APPLAUD BOTH THE AUTHOR AND

05:56:38.977 --> 05:56:39.611
THE OPPOSITION FOR WORKING

05:56:39.678 --> 05:56:41.113
TOGETHER AND FOR SEEING SUCH

05:56:41.179 --> 05:56:41.813
INCREDIBLE MOVEMENT, WHILE AT

05:56:41.880 --> 05:56:43.648
THE SAME TIME, A BILL THAT

05:56:43.715 --> 05:56:45.283
CONTINUES TO BE A HUGE STEP

05:56:45.350 --> 05:56:46.351
FORWARD FOR CONSUMERS. I THINK

05:56:46.418 --> 05:56:49.287
THAT IT'S REALLY ANNOYING TO ALL

05:56:49.354 --> 05:56:50.822
OF US WHEN WE THINK WE'RE

05:56:50.889 --> 05:56:52.791
GETTING ONE PRICE AND WE SHOW UP

05:56:52.858 --> 05:56:54.459
AND IT'S A DIFFERENT PRICE, AND

05:56:54.526 --> 05:56:56.027
I THINK THAT CHANGE IN AND OF

05:56:56.094 --> 05:56:56.862
ITSELF WILL BE MAGNIFICENT FOR

05:56:56.928 --> 05:56:58.663
CONSUMERS. AND SO I APPRECIATE

05:56:58.730 --> 05:56:59.798
THE BILL, ALTHOUGH I KNOW IT

05:56:59.865 --> 05:57:01.867
DOES A LOT OF OTHER THINGS AS

05:57:01.933 --> 05:57:03.335
WELL AS HIGHLIGHTED BY MY

05:57:03.401 --> 05:57:07.405
CONSTITUENT HERE. AND BUT I DO

05:57:07.472 --> 05:57:08.640
YOU KNOW, I KNOW WE'VE HAD

05:57:08.707 --> 05:57:11.276
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT, YOU KNOW,

05:57:11.343 --> 05:57:12.811
THERE'S ROOM, I THINK, TO EVEN

05:57:12.878 --> 05:57:13.912
CONTINUE TO REFINE THE BILL.

05:57:13.979 --> 05:57:15.180
IT'S COMING TO PRIVACY AND

05:57:15.247 --> 05:57:16.715
CONSUMER PROTECTION NEXT. AND I

05:57:16.782 --> 05:57:18.150
THINK WE CAN REALLY GET THIS

05:57:18.216 --> 05:57:19.918
BILL TO A PLACE WHERE EVERYONE

05:57:19.985 --> 05:57:20.986
WILL FEEL GOOD ABOUT SUPPORTING

05:57:21.052 --> 05:57:22.888
IT. AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO

05:57:22.954 --> 05:57:24.156
CONTINUING THOSE CONVERSATIONS

05:57:24.222 --> 05:57:24.823
AND SUPPORTING YOU TODAY. THANK

05:57:24.890 --> 05:57:26.291
YOU, MADAM VICE CHAIR. THANK

05:57:26.358 --> 05:57:28.293
YOU. WELL, I'LL JOIN THE CHORUS.

05:57:28.360 --> 05:57:30.028
I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT WE HAVE

05:57:30.095 --> 05:57:34.332
AN INDUSTRY GROUP AND LISTENING

05:57:34.399 --> 05:57:35.233
TO RESOLVE THE ISSUES NOT ONLY

05:57:35.300 --> 05:57:37.636
OF CONSUMERS BUT OF THE BUSINESS

05:57:37.702 --> 05:57:39.671
GROUP AND WITH THE AUTHOR TO DO

05:57:39.738 --> 05:57:41.239
GREAT LEGISLATION AND NEW LAWS

05:57:41.306 --> 05:57:42.607
THAT HAVEN'T BEEN ADDRESSED IN

05:57:42.674 --> 05:57:44.543
DECADES. I THINK THAT'S HIGHLY

05:57:44.609 --> 05:57:46.578
COMMENDABLE. AS WITH ALL NEW

05:57:46.645 --> 05:57:47.979
LAWS OR PROPOSED LAWS, THE

05:57:48.046 --> 05:57:49.381
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.

05:57:49.447 --> 05:57:50.882
INTERESTING THAT PEOPLE COULD

05:57:50.949 --> 05:57:54.119
POSSIBLY POTENTIALLY BUY A CAR

05:57:54.186 --> 05:57:57.022
AND THREE DAYS LATER RETURN IT

05:57:57.088 --> 05:57:58.757
LIKE A RENTAL CAR. SO THOSE ARE

05:57:58.824 --> 05:58:00.959
SOME UNINTENDED ASPECTS OF THE

05:58:01.026 --> 05:58:03.895
PERIOD OF TIME TO RETURN THE CAR

05:58:03.962 --> 05:58:05.964
IN. BUT I JUST HOPE IT'S IN THE

05:58:06.031 --> 05:58:07.032
GOOD FAITH THAT'S GOING ON. I

05:58:07.098 --> 05:58:08.500
THINK THAT'S FANTASTIC TO

05:58:08.567 --> 05:58:10.235
PROTECT OUR CONSUMERS. BUT ALSO

05:58:10.302 --> 05:58:12.737
I FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT PROTECTING

05:58:12.804 --> 05:58:14.940
THOSE ENTITIES THAT ARE IN THE

05:58:15.006 --> 05:58:16.074
BUSINESS OF SELLING CARS AND

05:58:16.141 --> 05:58:18.944
USED CARS IN THIS IN THIS

05:58:19.010 --> 05:58:20.645
INDUSTRY. AND OFTENTIMES IT IS

05:58:20.712 --> 05:58:22.914
FRAUGHT WITH PROBLEM CARS.

05:58:22.981 --> 05:58:24.249
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE BEING SOLD,

05:58:24.316 --> 05:58:26.218
USED, I GUESS. BUT LET'S MAKE

05:58:26.284 --> 05:58:28.253
SURE THAT WE CAN CREATE A

05:58:28.320 --> 05:58:29.855
SUCCESSFUL MARKET FOR BOTH. SO I

05:58:29.921 --> 05:58:31.456
LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING A

05:58:31.523 --> 05:58:32.324
SUCCESSFUL BILL. THANK YOU.

05:58:32.390 --> 05:58:33.925
THANK YOU. AND I DO WANT TO

05:58:33.992 --> 05:58:35.827
CLARIFY THAT THERE'S A CAP ON

05:58:35.894 --> 05:58:36.928
THE MILEAGE. SO YOU CAN'T JUST

05:58:36.995 --> 05:58:39.764
GO OFF ON A ON A LONG TRIP ON A

05:58:39.831 --> 05:58:41.132
ROAD TRIP. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE IT

05:58:41.199 --> 05:58:42.767
AT 400 MILES. I MEAN, YOU CAN

05:58:42.834 --> 05:58:44.536
KEEP TALKING. WELL, THAT'S

05:58:44.603 --> 05:58:46.137
IMPORTANT, BUT YOU COULD RENT

05:58:46.204 --> 05:58:47.372
IT. I MEAN, YOU COULD BUY IT FOR

05:58:47.439 --> 05:58:49.441
A WEEKEND AND THEN DECIDE THREE

05:58:49.507 --> 05:58:50.175
DAYS LATER THAT AFTER YOU'VE

05:58:50.242 --> 05:58:51.042
TAKEN YOUR LITTLE, THAT THAT'S

AND THE OPPOSITION SAYS, NO, NO,

05:59:29.180 --> 05:59:31.082
NO. AND THEN IT JUST BECOMES A

05:59:31.149 --> 05:59:32.884
BIG BATTLE AND YOU HAVE TO PICK

05:59:32.951 --> 05:59:34.853
A SIDE. AND HERE I DON'T THINK

05:59:34.920 --> 05:59:36.354

05:59:51.870 --> 05:59:52.904

WITH SOME OF THE ISSUES ON

06:00:08.586 --> 06:00:09.020
IMPLEMENTATION, BUT I'M

06:00:09.087 --> 06:00:10.555
CONFIDENT WE CAN GET THERE. AND

06:00:10.622 --> 06:00:12.424
I WANT TO THANK SHARON. OUR

06:00:12.490 --> 06:00:13.224

06:00:13.291 --> 06:00:14.893
CONVENING THE TWO SIDES. AND I

06:00:14.960 --> 06:00:16.528
THINK THAT THAT'S, YOU KNOW,

06:00:16.594 --> 06:00:17.162
THIS IS HOW LEGISLATION SHOULD

06:00:17.228 --> 06:00:19.464
WORK WHEN YOU HAVE A BILL OF

06:00:19.531 --> 06:00:21.633
THIS MAGNITUDE OF IMPORTANCE AND

06:00:21.700 --> 06:00:24.102
YOU HAVE OPPOSITION THAT

06:00:24.169 --> 06:00:25.203
OFTENTIMES WE HEAR OPPOSITION

06:00:25.270 --> 06:00:27.205
SAY, WELL, I AGREE WITH THE

06:00:27.272 --> 06:00:28.106
INTENT OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

06:00:28.173 --> 06:00:29.808
DO, BUT AND THEN THAT IT STOPS

06:00:29.874 --> 06:00:32.510
THERE. BUT HERE, I THINK WE'RE

06:00:32.577 --> 06:00:33.511
ACTUALLY GETTING A SENSE THEY

06:00:33.578 --> 06:00:34.746
ACTUALLY ACTUALLY DOES AGREE

06:00:34.813 --> 06:00:36.748
WITH THE INTENTION AND IS TRYING

06:00:36.815 --> 06:00:38.950
TO FIND A WAY TO GET THERE. AND

06:00:39.017 --> 06:00:40.752
I THINK THAT IS A GREAT CREDIT

06:00:40.819 --> 06:00:42.053
TO THE AUTHOR, TO THE OPPOSITION

06:00:42.120 --> 06:00:42.954
AND EVERYONE ENGAGED AND

06:00:43.021 --> 06:00:44.756
INVOLVED IN THIS. AND SO I LOOK

06:00:44.823 --> 06:00:45.824
FORWARD TO THIS, YOU KNOW,

06:00:45.890 --> 06:00:46.925
GETTING TO THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR IN

06:00:46.992 --> 06:00:48.860
A PLACE WHERE I THINK EVERYONE

WILL FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE

06:00:50.829 --> 06:00:51.396
SUPPORTING IT, AND I THINK IT'S

06:00:51.463 --> 06:00:53.732
GOING TO BE A BIG DEAL WHEN THIS

06:00:53.798 --> 06:00:55.000
ULTIMATELY GETS SIGNED INTO LAW.

06:00:55.066 --> 06:00:56.267
AND I TRULY BELIEVE THAT IT

06:00:56.334 --> 06:00:57.736
WILL, BASED UPON THE WAY THAT

06:00:57.802 --> 06:00:58.770
OUR AUTHOR HERE, SENATOR ALLEN,

06:00:58.837 --> 06:01:00.472

IS COMING TO THE TABLE IN SUCH A

06:01:02.907 --> 06:01:06.244
AN AMIABLE WAY TO FIND THAT PATH

06:01:06.311 --> 06:01:08.780
FORWARD TOGETHER. DO WE HAVE A

AMIABLE, AND I DO WANT TO THANK

06:01:18.156 --> 06:01:21.426

EASY CONVERSATION AT THE FIRST

06:01:22.560 --> 06:01:25.563

06:01:25.630 --> 06:01:27.966

WHICH IS JUST ABOUT INCREASING

06:01:31.436 --> 06:01:32.237
TRANSPARENCY, REDUCING THE

06:01:32.303 --> 06:01:33.304
LIKELIHOOD OF CONSUMERS BEING

06:01:33.371 --> 06:01:34.672
MISLED, MAKING THE WHOLE CAR

06:01:34.739 --> 06:01:36.975
BUYING EXPERIENCE A BETTER ONE

06:01:37.042 --> 06:01:39.044

06:01:39.110 --> 06:01:40.912
APPRECIATE EVERYONE RECOGNIZING

MEDICAL RESPONSE PERSONNEL

06:04:15.667 --> 06:04:17.869
STATEWIDE. WHEN A FIREFIGHTER

06:04:17.936 --> 06:04:19.771
ARRIVES ON THE SCENE OF AN

06:04:19.837 --> 06:04:21.472
INCIDENT, THEIR PRIMARY FOCUS

06:04:21.539 --> 06:04:22.574
AND THEIR FOCUS IS THE

06:04:22.640 --> 06:04:23.942
PRESERVATION OF LIFE AND

06:04:24.008 --> 06:04:25.009
PROPERTY. BUT AT TIMES THEY WILL

06:04:25.076 --> 06:04:26.611
OBSERVE A SCENE AND BETTER

06:04:26.678 --> 06:04:27.812
UNDERSTAND WHAT CHARACTERISTICS

FACILITATE THEIR RESPONSE IN THE

06:04:31.249 --> 06:04:32.217
FUTURE. HOWEVER, THAT DOESN'T

06:04:32.283 --> 06:04:33.585
REALLY GIVE THEM A VIEW AT

06:04:33.651 --> 06:04:35.520
OVERALL TRENDS IN MOTOR VEHICLE

06:04:35.587 --> 06:04:38.022
ACCIDENTS AND HOW TECHNOLOGY MAY

06:04:38.089 --> 06:04:39.557
BE CONTRIBUTING OR NOT

06:04:39.624 --> 06:04:41.192
CONTRIBUTING TO THOSE THOSE

06:04:41.259 --> 06:04:42.727
INCIDENTS. SO, AS NOTED BY THE

06:04:42.794 --> 06:04:45.163
AUTHOR AND IN THE ANALYSIS, THE

06:04:45.230 --> 06:04:47.432
CRASH DATA FOR LEVEL TWO

06:04:47.498 --> 06:04:48.366
ADVANCED DRIVER ASSISTANCE

06:04:48.433 --> 06:04:49.801

ADMINISTRATION, AND THAT DATA IS

06:04:53.905 --> 06:04:55.206
CRITICAL TO REALLY UNDERSTAND

06:04:55.273 --> 06:04:56.774
HOW THESE INCIDENTS MAY BE

06:04:56.841 --> 06:04:57.976
OCCURRING AND IF AN INTERVENTION

06:04:58.042 --> 06:04:59.210
IS NECESSARY, IF THEY'RE

06:04:59.277 --> 06:05:01.446
OCCURRING AT A WIDE SCALE. SO WE

06:05:01.512 --> 06:05:02.647
THINK THIS BILL PROVIDES A

06:05:02.714 --> 06:05:03.681
REALLY IMPORTANT BACKSTOP BY

06:05:03.748 --> 06:05:05.149
HAVING THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR

06:14:18.402 --> 06:14:21.472
MIDDLE OF A 40 BILL SENATE

06:14:22.973 --> 06:14:23.908

06:14:23.974 --> 06:14:26.177
HERE. AND I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU

06:14:26.243 --> 06:14:28.012
SINCE 830. BEING FIRED BY ITEM

06:14:28.078 --> 06:14:33.417
18 WAS NOT MY CHOICE. SENATE

06:14:33.484 --> 06:14:38.022
BILL 839 RELATES TO OIL SPILL

06:14:38.088 --> 06:14:40.491
PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE. IT

06:14:40.558 --> 06:14:42.393
REDUCES THE NUMBER OF

06:14:42.459 --> 06:14:44.528
UNNECESSARY FISHERY CLOSURES.

06:14:44.595 --> 06:14:49.333
CLOSURES, BASICALLY, PREVIOUSLY,

06:14:49.400 --> 06:14:53.137
42 GALLONS WAS DEFINED AS A

06:14:53.204 --> 06:14:54.905
SPILL AND THIS THRESHOLD WAS

06:14:54.972 --> 06:14:57.374
REMOVED. AND IT FORCES A

06:14:57.441 --> 06:14:59.810
RESPONSE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF

06:14:59.877 --> 06:15:01.345
FISH AND WILDLIFE IN

06:15:01.412 --> 06:15:03.314
CONSULTATION WITH THE OUIJA, IN

06:15:03.380 --> 06:15:05.850
A WAY THAT IT MIGHT BE A GALLON,

06:15:05.916 --> 06:15:07.918
IT MIGHT BE JUST A CAN OF OIL,

06:15:07.985 --> 06:15:10.087
AND IT REQUIRES A FORMAL

06:15:10.154 --> 06:15:12.223
RESPONSE. AND WHAT THIS BILL

06:15:12.289 --> 06:15:17.561
DOES IS. IT MAKES THAT EASIER IN

06:15:17.628 --> 06:15:20.865
A WAY, A DECISION ON HOW TO ACT,

06:15:20.931 --> 06:15:22.199
ON HOW TO NOT AUTOMATICALLY

06:15:22.266 --> 06:15:25.236
CLOSE A WETLAND BECAUSE OF THAT

06:15:25.302 --> 06:15:27.037
HAPPENS. IT ALSO REMOVES A

06:15:27.104 --> 06:15:29.106
LIABILITY EXEMPTION FOR PRIVATE

06:15:29.173 --> 06:15:30.674
PLEASURE BOATS. AND FOR EXAMPLE,

06:15:30.741 --> 06:15:33.410
THERE WAS A YACHT CALLED THE

06:15:33.477 --> 06:15:34.945
ADMIRAL IN MARINA DEL REY WHERE

06:15:35.012 --> 06:15:37.348
THERE WERE 4000 GALLONS OF

06:15:37.414 --> 06:15:38.949
DIESEL THAT WERE RELEASED. AND

06:15:39.016 --> 06:15:42.219
IT REMOVES THAT EXEMPTION. SO IT

06:15:42.286 --> 06:15:43.487
ALLOWS DATA DRIVEN,

06:15:43.554 --> 06:15:44.655
COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS TO ADDRESS

06:15:44.722 --> 06:15:46.257

06:15:50.728 --> 06:15:52.196

06:42:55.718 --> 06:42:58.521
WANT TO THANK THE STAFF OF THIS

ALL RIGHT. WE'LL BRING IT BACK

06:43:19.909 --> 06:43:22.011
TO COMMITTEE. AND IF WE CAN HAVE

06:43:22.077 --> 06:43:23.078
ANOTHER MOTION, ONLY BECAUSE

06:43:23.145 --> 06:43:23.979
THAT MOTION WAS DONE BEFORE THE

06:43:24.046 --> 06:43:25.881
SENATOR ACTUALLY APPROACHED THE

06:43:25.948 --> 06:43:27.149
DESK. IS THERE A MOTION? I'LL

06:43:27.216 --> 06:43:28.984
MOVE THE BILL. WE HAVE A MOTION

06:43:29.051 --> 06:43:32.021
IN A SECOND AND A THIRD. ANY

06:43:32.087 --> 06:43:33.422
QUESTIONS? YES, MADAM VICE

06:43:33.489 --> 06:43:36.025
CHAIR. HI. HI, SENATOR. THANK

06:43:36.091 --> 06:43:37.326
YOU. I THINK THIS IS AN

06:43:37.393 --> 06:43:38.861
IMPORTANT BILL. I WANT TO

06:43:38.928 --> 06:43:40.596
CLARIFY A COUPLE ITEMS TO

06:43:40.663 --> 06:43:42.731
EDUCATE ME. WHY IS THE

06:43:42.798 --> 06:43:44.567
CALIFORNIA INFRASTRUCTURE AND

06:43:44.633 --> 06:43:46.001
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BANK NOT

06:43:46.068 --> 06:43:49.204
ADEQUATE? SO THE BANK HAS A

06:43:49.271 --> 06:43:51.440
DIFFERENT MISSION. I HAD THE

06:43:51.507 --> 06:43:52.908
HONOR OF SERVING ON THE BANK

06:43:52.975 --> 06:43:56.478
WHEN I WORKED FOR GOVERNOR BROWN

06:43:56.545 --> 06:43:59.315
A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO, AND THE

06:43:59.381 --> 06:44:01.784
KINDS OF PROJECTS THAT ARE, THAT

06:44:01.850 --> 06:44:05.054
THEY FINANCE ARE, FOR THE MOST

06:44:05.120 --> 06:44:07.289
PART, PROJECTS THAT HAVE A

06:44:07.356 --> 06:44:10.526
REVENUE SOURCE. FOR EXAMPLE,

06:44:10.593 --> 06:44:12.561
MUSEUMS, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

06:44:12.628 --> 06:44:14.063
PROJECTS LIKE PARKING

06:44:14.129 --> 06:44:17.566
STRUCTURES, THINGS THAT ARE

06:44:17.633 --> 06:44:22.004
VERY, VERY SAFE BUT ALSO ARE

06:44:22.071 --> 06:44:24.506
LOCATED IN BIG URBAN CENTERS.

06:44:24.573 --> 06:44:26.775
AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH

06:44:26.842 --> 06:44:30.045
THIS CONCEPT IS TO LOOK

06:44:30.112 --> 06:44:31.814
STATEWIDE, BE ABLE TO FUND

06:44:31.880 --> 06:44:33.415
PROJECTS THAT ARE OF

06:44:33.482 --> 06:44:35.684
SIGNIFICANCE ALL OVER THE STATE.

06:44:35.751 --> 06:44:38.654
AND THIS THE RESOURCES THAT

06:44:38.721 --> 06:44:40.823
WOULD BE ALLOCATED WOULD COME

06:44:40.889 --> 06:44:42.825
FROM PRIVATE AS WELL AS PUBLIC

06:44:42.891 --> 06:44:44.627
SOURCES. AND THE BANK DOES NOT

06:44:44.693 --> 06:44:49.164
DOES NOT DO THAT. OKAY. I ALSO

06:44:49.231 --> 06:44:50.466
IF YOU'D LIKE MORE INFORMATION

06:44:50.532 --> 06:44:53.002
ON THE BANK OKAY. YEAH. NO. AND

06:44:53.068 --> 06:44:54.470
THEN ALSO THERE'S A LIMITATION

06:44:54.536 --> 06:44:57.006
ON HOW MUCH THE PROJECTS ARE. I

06:44:57.072 --> 06:45:00.809
BELIEVE IT'S ABOUT 650 MILLION

06:45:00.876 --> 06:45:03.779
OR 600. SORRY 65 MILLION. SORRY

06:45:03.846 --> 06:45:06.649
I IN MY HEAD I'M SO SORRY. BUT

06:45:06.715 --> 06:45:09.652
ALSO THEY DON'T DO HOUSING

06:45:09.718 --> 06:45:11.053
PROJECTS. AND SO SINCE WE ARE

06:45:11.120 --> 06:45:12.721
ABROAD, WE'D BE ABLE TO ADDRESS

06:45:12.788 --> 06:45:13.956
THAT NEED AS WELL. OKAY, THEN,

06:45:14.023 --> 06:45:16.091
ONE MORE QUESTION. THE GENTLEMAN

06:45:16.158 --> 06:45:18.027
THERE AT THE END OF THE TABLE,

06:45:18.093 --> 06:45:19.862
THE RURAL. YOU HAD A RURAL POINT

06:45:19.928 --> 06:45:21.397
OF VIEW. YOU DID MENTION IN YOUR

06:45:21.463 --> 06:45:22.898
LISTING OF DIFFERENT FINANCING

06:45:22.965 --> 06:45:24.900
MECHANISMS. YOU DID MENTION TAX

06:45:24.967 --> 06:45:27.536
INCREMENT FINANCING JUST FROM MY

06:45:27.603 --> 06:45:29.338
LOCAL GOVERNMENT EXPERIENCE

06:45:29.405 --> 06:45:30.773
GOING BACK MANY, MANY YEARS,

06:45:30.839 --> 06:45:32.574
SEEING WHAT THE CITY OF LOS

06:45:32.641 --> 06:45:33.676
ANGELES DID AND OTHER IN ORANGE

06:45:33.742 --> 06:45:35.778
COUNTY TAX INCREMENT FINANCING

06:45:35.844 --> 06:45:38.714
SOUNDS GOOD, BUT IT ROBS LOCAL

06:45:38.781 --> 06:45:40.516
FACILITIES, LIBRARIES, PUBLIC

06:45:40.582 --> 06:45:43.318
SPACES FROM THAT THAT THAT

06:45:43.385 --> 06:45:45.587
INCREMENTAL DOLLARS INSTEAD GOES

06:45:45.654 --> 06:45:47.823
INTO ANOTHER PLACE FOR

06:45:47.890 --> 06:45:49.224
REDEVELOPMENT. THAT'S WHY

06:45:49.291 --> 06:45:49.792
GOVERNOR BROWN, ONE OF THE

06:45:49.858 --> 06:45:51.193
REASONS WHY HE SUSPENDED

06:45:51.260 --> 06:45:52.361
REDEVELOPMENT, BECAUSE TAX

06:45:52.428 --> 06:45:54.196
INCREMENT FINANCING WAS

06:45:54.263 --> 06:45:56.031
PREVENTING REINVESTMENT IN OUR

06:45:56.098 --> 06:45:58.467
COMMUNITIES. SO LONG QUESTION

06:45:58.534 --> 06:46:00.302
ARE YOU GOING TO BE USING THAT

06:46:00.369 --> 06:46:02.638
MECHANISM OR IS THAT OPEN TO

06:46:02.705 --> 06:46:04.406
YOU. BECAUSE THAT GIVES ME A

06:46:04.473 --> 06:46:06.775
LITTLE BIT OF CONCERN. SURE. I

06:46:06.842 --> 06:46:07.676
THINK I WAS JUST MENTIONING THAT

06:46:07.743 --> 06:46:08.677
AS AN OPTION THAT COMMUNITIES

06:46:08.744 --> 06:46:10.079
ARE USING CURRENTLY. SO THINGS

06:46:10.145 --> 06:46:12.181
SUCH AS THE IFDS, THE ENHANCED

06:46:12.247 --> 06:46:13.248
INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING

06:46:13.315 --> 06:46:15.084
DISTRICTS, OR AN EXAMPLE OF TIF

06:46:15.150 --> 06:46:17.352
OR TAX INCREMENT FINANCING. SO

06:46:17.419 --> 06:46:18.987
JUST WANTED TO MENTION THAT

06:46:19.054 --> 06:46:20.155
THAT'S CURRENTLY WHAT IS A TOOL

06:46:20.222 --> 06:46:21.590
THAT MIGHT BE BEING USED. AND

06:46:21.657 --> 06:46:22.925
THAT'S WHY WE NEED SOMETHING

06:46:22.991 --> 06:46:24.993
LIKE SB 769 TO EXPAND UPON THE

06:46:25.060 --> 06:46:26.595
TOOLS THAT WE CAN USE. I THINK

06:46:26.662 --> 06:46:29.465
IT JUST HAS NOT POSITIVE IMPACT.

06:46:29.531 --> 06:46:31.934
IT HAS A NEGATIVE. I THINK IT

06:46:32.000 --> 06:46:33.102
PREVENTS REINVESTMENT IN THE

06:46:33.168 --> 06:46:34.937
COMMUNITY FOR PUBLIC STRUCTURES,

06:46:35.003 --> 06:46:37.372
LIBRARIES, PUBLIC SPACES, ETC.

06:46:37.439 --> 06:46:38.540
ANYWAY, BUT I APPRECIATE WHAT

06:46:38.607 --> 06:46:40.342
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO FOR THE

06:46:40.409 --> 06:46:41.243
OLYMPICS. OBVIOUSLY THAT'S VERY

06:46:41.310 --> 06:46:43.479
IMPORTANT. AND IF THIS HELPS GET

06:46:43.545 --> 06:46:45.047
THE NECESSARY FACILITIES BUILT,

06:46:45.114 --> 06:46:46.982
I WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE. SO THANK

06:46:47.049 --> 06:46:48.917
YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK

06:46:48.984 --> 06:46:50.385
YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR

06:46:50.452 --> 06:46:52.154
COMMENTS, ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAPAN.

06:46:52.221 --> 06:46:53.622
WELL, I JUST WANT TO THANK THE

06:46:53.689 --> 06:46:55.057
SENATOR FOR BRINGING FORWARD. WE

06:46:55.124 --> 06:46:56.024
HAD A BRIEF DISCUSSION BEFORE

06:46:56.091 --> 06:46:58.127
COMING IN HERE, AND I'M VERY

06:46:58.193 --> 06:46:59.695
MUCH IN FAVOR OF ANYTHING THAT

06:46:59.762 --> 06:47:01.530
GETS US CHEAPER MONEY TO DO

06:47:01.597 --> 06:47:02.564
INFRASTRUCTURE. SO I WISH YOU

06:47:02.631 --> 06:47:04.366
WELL IN THIS ENDEAVOR AND I'M

06:47:04.433 --> 06:47:05.434
VERY PLEASED TO SUPPORT THE

06:47:05.501 --> 06:47:07.202
BILL. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER

06:47:07.269 --> 06:47:08.904
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS? WE HAVE A

06:47:08.971 --> 06:47:10.773
MOTION ON THE TABLE. SENATOR,

06:47:10.839 --> 06:47:12.107
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING

06:47:12.174 --> 06:47:13.742
THIS FORWARD. I ALSO WOULD LIKE

06:47:13.809 --> 06:47:14.843
TO THANK OUR TREASURER FOR

06:47:14.910 --> 06:47:16.612
PARTNERING WITH YOU ON THIS.
