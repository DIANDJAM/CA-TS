00:39:26.097 --> 00:39:28.199
ESTABLISHED IN 1996, THE CHARTER

00:39:28.265 --> 00:39:30.367

00:39:36.707 --> 00:39:38.676
NOT ENCOURAGE OR DISCOURAGE

00:39:38.743 --> 00:39:40.478
CHARTER SCHOOLS. THE LOAN

00:39:40.544 --> 00:39:42.413
PROGRAM DOES ENGAGE IN WHETHER A

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.782
CHARTER SCHOOL SHOULD EXIST.

00:39:44.849 --> 00:39:47.318
EXCUSE ME, DOES NOT THE CHARTER

00:39:47.384 --> 00:39:49.520

00:39:49.587 --> 00:39:51.956
AN EXISTING LINE ITEM IN THE

00:39:52.022 --> 00:39:55.192
BUDGET? SINCE ASSUMING PROGRAM

00:39:55.259 --> 00:39:57.728

FINANCE AUTHORITY CSFA, WORKING

00:40:02.933 --> 00:40:04.301
ALONGSIDE THE CALIFORNIA

00:40:04.368 --> 00:40:06.871
TREASURER'S OFFICE, WHO WE HAVE

00:40:06.937 --> 00:40:08.472
REPRESENTATIVES HERE TODAY, HAVE

00:40:08.539 --> 00:40:10.007
SEEN A STEADY DECLINE IN THE

00:40:10.074 --> 00:40:11.809
NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS TO THE

00:40:11.876 --> 00:40:14.678
PROGRAM AS APPLICATIONS HAVE

00:40:14.745 --> 00:40:15.980
DECLINED. ACTUALLY, COSTS HAVE

00:40:16.046 --> 00:40:19.016
GONE UP AND THE CCFA HAS RAMPED

00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:21.619
UP ITS MARKETING EFFORTS TO

00:40:21.685 --> 00:40:22.953

CHARTER SCHOOLS OF THE LOAN

00:40:24.789 --> 00:40:26.590
PROGRAM. IN LIGHT OF THESE

00:40:26.657 --> 00:40:27.892
INCREASED COSTS, THIS BILL WILL

00:40:27.958 --> 00:40:30.361
ALLOW THE TREASURER'S OFFICE TO

00:40:30.427 --> 00:40:32.763
PROVIDE THE NECESSARY DOLLARS IN

00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:35.232
LOANS FROM THE CHARTER SCHOOL

00:40:35.299 --> 00:40:37.268
REVOLVING LOAN FUND. THIS AMOUNT

00:40:37.334 --> 00:40:39.103
IS LESS THAN WHAT THAT NUMBER

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:42.273
WOULD LOOK LIKE. EXCUSE ME. WE

00:40:42.339 --> 00:40:44.141
MADE SOME CHANGES AT THE LAST

00:40:44.208 --> 00:40:45.442

00:40:45.509 --> 00:40:47.845
WITH. WITH THESE CHANGES. THIS

00:40:47.912 --> 00:40:49.780
AMOUNT IS LESS THAN WHAT THAT

00:40:49.847 --> 00:40:52.383
NUMBER WOULD LOOK LIKE TODAY IF

00:40:52.449 --> 00:40:54.718

AND ON THE FLOOR, THIS BILL

00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:01.559
RECEIVED ZERO NO VOTES. AND SO

00:41:01.625 --> 00:41:03.227
I'M HOPING THE ASSEMBLY WILL DO

00:41:03.294 --> 00:41:05.396
THE SAME. IN FACT, DUE TO THE

00:41:05.462 --> 00:41:06.764
NATURE OF THE BILL, IT'S

00:41:06.831 --> 00:41:07.965

YOU SO MUCH, CHAIR. AND THANK

00:43:31.742 --> 00:43:33.510
YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING

00:43:33.577 --> 00:43:35.245
THIS FORWARD. I DID HAVE JUST A

00:43:35.312 --> 00:43:36.814
COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR THE

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:38.382
TREASURER'S OFFICE, JUST TO GET

00:43:38.449 --> 00:43:40.617
A SENSE OF KIND OF THE CONTEXT

00:43:40.684 --> 00:43:43.620
IN WHICH THIS REQUEST COMES. THE

00:43:43.687 --> 00:43:48.492
WHAT HAS BEEN THE AMOUNT OF WHAT

00:43:48.559 --> 00:43:51.462
WHAT WHAT'S THE FUND BALANCE OF

00:43:51.528 --> 00:43:59.203
THE. APPROXIMATE? THAT'S A RISKY

00:43:59.269 --> 00:44:01.772
MIC THERE. 20 I THINK I HEARD 27

00:44:01.839 --> 00:44:05.042
MILLION. AND HOW WHAT WAS THE

00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:06.944
FUNDING AMOUNT. WHAT WHAT AMOUNT

00:44:07.011 --> 00:44:08.979
OF DISBURSEMENT WAS THERE

00:44:09.046 --> 00:44:10.781
THROUGH THE LOAN FUND IN THE

00:44:10.848 --> 00:44:27.798
LAST TWO YEARS.

00:44:36.707 --> 00:44:38.308
GIVE ME ONE MINUTE TO DO SOME

00:44:38.375 --> 00:44:40.511
QUICK MATH. SO YOU SAID THE LAST

00:44:40.577 --> 00:44:42.646
FEW YEARS. YEAH. JUST IF YOU

00:44:42.713 --> 00:44:43.380
COULD GIVE HOW MUCH WAS

00:44:43.447 --> 00:44:44.515
DISBURSED LAST YEAR AND THE YEAR

00:44:44.581 --> 00:44:46.784
BEFORE. SO THERE'S A DIFFERENCE

00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:48.385
BETWEEN THE AMOUNT WE AWARD AND

00:44:48.452 --> 00:44:49.353
THE AMOUNT WE DISBURSE. SO WE

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:51.688
MAKE AN AWARD UP TO 250,000. AND

00:44:51.755 --> 00:44:54.258
THEN SCHOOLS MEET, NEED TO MEET

00:44:54.324 --> 00:44:54.892
CERTAIN BENCHMARKS IN ORDER TO

00:44:54.958 --> 00:44:56.226
RECEIVE UP TO 250,000. SO I

00:44:56.293 --> 00:44:58.295
DON'T WANT TO YOU KNOW, IT'S

00:44:58.362 --> 00:45:01.131
SEMANTICS. SO WE'VE AWARDED

00:45:01.198 --> 00:45:04.268
EIGHT LOANS. AND OF THAT AMOUNT

00:45:04.334 --> 00:45:06.170
I'D HAVE TO I DON'T HAVE THE

00:45:06.236 --> 00:45:07.571
DISPERSED VERSUS THE AWARD

00:45:07.638 --> 00:45:09.339
AMOUNT, BUT IT WOULD BE A

00:45:09.406 --> 00:45:15.679
FRACTION OF $2 MILLION. SO EIGHT

00:45:15.746 --> 00:45:19.416
LOANS AWARDED FOR WITH A TOTAL

00:45:19.483 --> 00:45:21.985
VALUE OF $2 MILLION POTENTIALLY

00:45:22.052 --> 00:45:24.054
DISPERSED. BUT THEN THERE'S LESS

00:45:24.121 --> 00:45:25.622
THAN THAT THAT HAS ACTUALLY BEEN

00:45:25.689 --> 00:45:27.424
DISPERSED BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO

00:45:27.491 --> 00:45:28.225
MEET THEIR CRITERIA. AND THAT

00:45:28.292 --> 00:45:30.227
WAS JUST LAST YEAR OR THE LAST

00:45:30.294 --> 00:45:31.962
TWO YEARS. THAT WAS FROM 2223

00:45:32.029 --> 00:45:39.403
THROUGH 2425. OKAY. SO $2

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:43.006
MILLION DISPERSED TO EIGHT

00:45:43.073 --> 00:45:46.343
AWARDEES WITH A TOTAL FUND OF 27

00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:49.680
MILLION, CORRECT? OKAY. ALL

00:45:49.746 --> 00:45:53.717
RIGHT. THAT SEEMS I MY

00:45:53.784 --> 00:45:54.518
UNDERSTANDING OF THIS BILL IS

00:45:54.585 --> 00:45:58.055
THAT IT INTENDS TO EXPAND THE

00:45:58.122 --> 00:46:01.692
POTENTIAL EITHER AWARDEES OR

00:46:01.758 --> 00:46:03.393
CRITERIA. IT DOES BY EXPANDING

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:05.229
WHO'S ELIGIBLE. SO CURRENTLY,

00:46:05.295 --> 00:46:06.630
ONLY CHARTERS IN THEIR FIRST

00:46:06.697 --> 00:46:08.398
CHARTER TERM ARE ELIGIBLE. AND

00:46:08.465 --> 00:46:09.867
SINCE FEWER CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE

00:46:09.933 --> 00:46:12.436
OPENING, IT WOULD EXPAND THAT TO

00:46:12.503 --> 00:46:13.937
ALL CHARTER SCHOOLS, WITH

00:46:14.004 --> 00:46:15.072
PRIORITY GIVEN FOR STARTUP

00:46:15.139 --> 00:46:16.440
SCHOOLS AND THOSE IMPACTED BY

00:46:16.507 --> 00:46:19.009
NATURAL DISASTERS AS A THIRD

00:46:19.076 --> 00:46:20.043
PRIORITY. IT WOULD BE ALL

00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:21.745
CHARTERS. GREAT. I APPRECIATE

00:46:21.812 --> 00:46:24.248
THE PARTICULAR FOCUS ON

00:46:24.314 --> 00:46:25.816
PROVIDING FUNDING TO SCHOOLS

00:46:25.883 --> 00:46:27.818
THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY

00:46:27.885 --> 00:46:29.887
NATURAL DISASTERS, INCLUDING THE

00:46:29.953 --> 00:46:31.855
WILDFIRES THAT I KNOW THE

00:46:31.922 --> 00:46:34.191
SENATOR CARES SO DEEPLY ABOUT IN

00:46:34.258 --> 00:46:35.792
TERMS OF SUPPORTING HER, HER

00:46:35.859 --> 00:46:37.528
COMMUNITY AND HER CONSTITUENCY.

00:46:37.594 --> 00:46:41.698
I JUST THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS THAT

00:46:41.765 --> 00:46:42.766
IS AVAILABLE VERSUS THE AMOUNT

00:46:42.833 --> 00:46:45.536
HAS BEEN SPENT SEEMS TO BE IN

00:46:45.602 --> 00:46:48.405
THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF 1%. YEAH.

00:46:48.472 --> 00:46:50.908
THERE WAS A PRECIPITOUS DROP IN

00:46:50.974 --> 00:46:52.609
2019, I THINK WHEN THE 1500

00:46:52.676 --> 00:46:54.311
BILLS, I MEAN, FEWER NEW

00:46:54.378 --> 00:46:57.247
CHARTERS OPENED AND WE, YOU

00:46:57.314 --> 00:47:00.284
KNOW, WE GET FEWER APPLICATIONS.

00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:01.418
OKAY. THANKS. I'M SURE THAT THIS

00:47:01.485 --> 00:47:02.653
WILL BE SOMETHING THAT OVER

00:47:02.719 --> 00:47:05.155
TIME, WE'LL BE ABLE TO SEE

00:47:05.222 --> 00:47:07.090
WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE ABLE TO

00:47:07.157 --> 00:47:09.026
AVAIL OURSELVES OF MORE OF THAT

00:47:09.092 --> 00:47:11.094
FUNDING WITH THESE CHANGES,

00:47:11.161 --> 00:47:13.130
BECAUSE THAT LEAVES A LOT OF

00:47:13.197 --> 00:47:14.464
MONEY UNSPENT. WELL, IT ALSO

00:47:14.531 --> 00:47:17.201
INCREASES THE LOAN AMOUNT FROM

00:47:17.267 --> 00:47:18.635
250,000 TO 500,000. YEAH.

00:47:18.702 --> 00:47:20.204
UNDERSTOOD. THANK YOU, THANK

00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:22.239
YOU. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.

00:47:22.306 --> 00:47:23.574
PERMISSION TO RESPOND THROUGH

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:26.643
THE CHAIR. YES. THANK YOU, MR.

00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:29.012
CHAIR. AND TO OUR COMMITTEE

00:47:29.079 --> 00:47:31.215
MEMBER HERE. A COUPLE OF THINGS.

00:47:31.281 --> 00:47:32.916
THE TREASURER APPROACHED ME FOR

00:47:32.983 --> 00:47:34.818
THE VERY REASON THAT SHE WANTED

00:47:34.885 --> 00:47:37.020
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE AVAILABLE

00:47:37.087 --> 00:47:39.923
FUNDS WERE GETTING OUT AS A AS

00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:41.758
INTENDED. SO THAT WAS HER VERY

00:47:41.825 --> 00:47:43.794
PURPOSE OF HER OFFICE WAS

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:45.562
EVALUATING THE VARIOUS FUNDING

00:47:45.629 --> 00:47:47.130
MECHANISMS AND IDENTIFYING,

00:47:47.197 --> 00:47:48.498
WELL, WE HAVE A FUNDING

00:47:48.565 --> 00:47:50.434
MECHANISM THAT'S NOT BEING

00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:51.568
UTILIZED. PART OF THE ISSUE OF

00:47:51.635 --> 00:47:53.637
IT NOT BEING UTILIZED WAS THE

00:47:53.704 --> 00:47:55.706
LOWER AMOUNT THAT WAS PROVIDED.

00:47:55.772 --> 00:47:57.541
SO A SCHOOL MIGHT TYPICALLY GO,

00:47:57.608 --> 00:47:58.709
OH MY GOODNESS. YOU KNOW,

00:47:58.775 --> 00:48:01.211
ACTUALLY I NEED $1 MILLION FOR

00:48:01.278 --> 00:48:02.980
SOMETHING. AND 250 ISN'T GOING

00:48:03.046 --> 00:48:04.348
TO GET ME THERE. AND HENCE

00:48:04.414 --> 00:48:06.550
PEOPLE WEREN'T NECESSARILY

00:48:06.617 --> 00:48:08.185
RESPONDING. WE ALSO HAD COVID.

00:48:08.252 --> 00:48:10.554
THAT WAS IN THE PERIOD THERE OF

00:48:10.621 --> 00:48:12.389
2019. SO ALL OF THOSE THINGS

00:48:12.456 --> 00:48:13.690
COMBINED, IT WAS THE REQUEST OF

00:48:13.757 --> 00:48:15.726
THE TREASURER THAT WE INCREASED

00:48:15.792 --> 00:48:18.795
THE AMOUNT TO ALLOW FOR THE

00:48:18.862 --> 00:48:20.731
ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT ARE NOW

00:48:20.797 --> 00:48:23.300
REQUIRED FOR MANY OF THE ITEMS

00:48:23.367 --> 00:48:25.335
THAT NEED TO BE IMPROVED IN THE

00:48:25.402 --> 00:48:30.140
SCHOOLS. ALL RIGHT. SEEING NO

00:48:30.207 --> 00:48:31.408
FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE

00:48:31.475 --> 00:48:33.010

EDUCATION CODE DECADES AGO, WHEN

00:51:24.147 --> 00:51:25.615
PEOPLE WERE TEACHING ABOUT WORLD

00:51:25.682 --> 00:51:29.186
WAR TWO AND TRYING TO AVOID

00:51:29.252 --> 00:51:33.457
UNCOMFORTABLE SUBJECTS. FOUND

00:51:33.523 --> 00:51:35.725
THEMSELVES WANTING TO NOT TALK

00:51:35.792 --> 00:51:39.696
ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST. IN THE

00:51:39.763 --> 00:51:41.531
EARLY 80S, THE LEGISLATURE

00:51:41.598 --> 00:51:44.100
CHANGED THE CODE TO REMIND EVERY

00:51:44.167 --> 00:51:46.636
LÀ IN THE STATE THAT WE NEED TO

00:51:46.703 --> 00:51:49.072
HAVE PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON

00:51:49.139 --> 00:51:51.575
HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES, AND IT

00:51:51.641 --> 00:51:55.545
CALLS OUT THE HOLOCAUST, SLAVERY

00:51:55.612 --> 00:51:59.249
IN PARTICULAR. THERE THERE HAVE

00:51:59.316 --> 00:52:03.186
BEEN MANY CASES OF CERTAINLY

00:52:03.253 --> 00:52:05.121
BEFORE THAT LAW WHERE YOU WOULD

00:52:05.188 --> 00:52:06.957
TEACH ABOUT, SAY, THE CIVIL WAR

00:52:07.023 --> 00:52:08.825
AND THEN AVOID THE UNCOMFORTABLE

00:52:08.892 --> 00:52:10.293
SUBJECT OF SLAVERY AND JUST SAY

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:12.028
IT WAS A FIGHT BETWEEN THE NORTH

00:52:12.095 --> 00:52:13.296
AND SOUTH, JUST LIKE WORLD WAR

00:52:13.363 --> 00:52:15.999
TWO COULD HAVE JUST BEEN A WAR

00:52:16.066 --> 00:52:16.833
AMONG NATIONS. BUT IF YOU EDIT

00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:18.869
OUT PARTS OF HISTORY THAT ARE

00:52:18.935 --> 00:52:20.403
UNCOMFORTABLE, WE LOSE SOMETHING

00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:22.839
DEEP IN OUR CONSCIENCE AND WE

00:52:22.906 --> 00:52:25.041
LEAVE OUR STUDENTS BEREFT OF A

00:52:25.108 --> 00:52:26.343
DEEPER SENSITIVITY AND

00:52:26.409 --> 00:52:27.911
UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE WORLD

00:52:27.978 --> 00:52:29.713
WORKS AND HOW THE WORLD CAN TURN

00:52:29.779 --> 00:52:32.115
QUITE EVIL. EVEN IN MODERN

00:52:32.182 --> 00:52:35.519
DEMOCRACIES, AND EVEN IN PLACES

00:52:35.585 --> 00:52:36.853
THAT YOU THINK THAT EVERYTHING

00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:39.689
IS FINE, IT'S OFTEN QUITE A

00:52:39.756 --> 00:52:43.627
RAZOR'S EDGE. WE'VE SEEN A RISE

00:52:43.693 --> 00:52:46.162
IN IGNORANCE AROUND WHAT THE

00:52:46.229 --> 00:52:47.998
HOLOCAUST WAS AND WHAT A

00:52:48.064 --> 00:52:50.934
GENOCIDE ACTUALLY MEANS. IN THE

00:52:51.001 --> 00:52:53.803
PAST YEARS. I KNOW MY

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:54.838
GENERATION. I'M AN OLD

00:52:54.905 --> 00:52:59.809
MILLENNIAL, BUT ACCORDING TO A

00:52:59.876 --> 00:53:02.846
NATIONWIDE POLL, MOST

00:53:02.913 --> 00:53:06.316
MILLENNIALS CANNOT TELL YOU WHAT

00:53:06.383 --> 00:53:08.585
AUSCHWITZ WAS IF YOU ASKED THEM.

00:53:08.652 --> 00:53:12.422
AND I THINK IT'S A QUARTER OF

00:53:12.489 --> 00:53:14.991
THE NEXT GENERATION ARE

00:53:15.058 --> 00:53:16.293
SKEPTICAL AS TO WHETHER THE

00:53:16.359 --> 00:53:18.628
HOLOCAUST EVEN OCCURRED OR NOT.

00:53:18.695 --> 00:53:21.865
THERE IS A DEEP SEATED,

00:53:21.932 --> 00:53:24.801
CONSPIRACY DRIVEN DISINFORMATION

00:53:24.868 --> 00:53:26.236
CAMPAIGN THAT IS STILL ALIVE AND

00:53:26.303 --> 00:53:28.438
WELL. I KNOW IT BECAUSE PEOPLE

00:53:28.505 --> 00:53:30.140
FOLLOWED MY FATHER IN LAW AROUND

00:53:30.206 --> 00:53:31.408
FOR ABOUT A DECADE, SAYING THAT

00:53:31.474 --> 00:53:33.043
HE DIDN'T ACTUALLY GO THROUGH

00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:34.844
AUSCHWITZ AND HAVE HIS WHOLE

00:53:34.911 --> 00:53:38.148
FAMILY KILLED, AND THEY SAY THAT

00:53:38.214 --> 00:53:39.783
IT WASN'T REAL AND THAT HE MADE

00:53:39.849 --> 00:53:43.253
IT UP. AND WE CAN DISMISS THAT

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:45.622
AS JUST PURE IGNORANCE. BUT IN

00:53:45.689 --> 00:53:49.993
FACT, IT'S A VERY REAL, REAL

00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:51.161
VIRUS WORKING ITS WAY THROUGH

00:53:51.227 --> 00:53:54.030
OUR SOCIETY. WE'VE FORMED QUITE

00:53:54.097 --> 00:53:58.268
A COALITION IN THIS STATE FROM

00:53:58.335 --> 00:53:59.502
SURVIVORS NOT JUST OF THE

00:53:59.569 --> 00:54:01.805
HOLOCAUST, BUT FROM SOME OF THE

00:54:01.871 --> 00:54:04.274
OTHER KEY GENOCIDES THAT HAVE

00:54:04.341 --> 00:54:07.744
OCCURRED IN MODERN HISTORY, FROM

00:54:07.811 --> 00:54:10.880
THE ARMENIAN COMMUNITY, FROM THE

00:54:10.947 --> 00:54:13.416
RWANDAN COMMUNITY, THE CAMBODIAN

00:54:13.483 --> 00:54:15.285
COMMUNITY. AND WE'VE BEEN TRYING

00:54:15.352 --> 00:54:16.987
TO GET TEACHERS AND TRAINERS WHO

00:54:17.053 --> 00:54:19.422
ARE ACTUALLY SURVIVORS OF THESE

00:54:19.489 --> 00:54:21.691
ATROCITIES TO HELP EDUCATE

00:54:21.758 --> 00:54:23.493
TEACHERS. SO WITH US HERE IN

00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:26.329
COMMITTEE TODAY, LIZ EGRA IS ONE

00:54:26.396 --> 00:54:29.165
OF THOSE SURVIVOR TEACHERS WHO

00:54:29.232 --> 00:54:30.333
IS PART OF OUR COLLABORATIVE AND

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.435
IS HELPING STRENGTHEN THE NEXT

00:54:32.502 --> 00:54:34.638
GENERATION OF TEACHERS. AND THEN

00:54:34.704 --> 00:54:36.072
ONE OF HER STUDENTS. I GUESS I

00:54:36.139 --> 00:54:38.875
CAN CALL YOU THAT, MISS

00:54:38.942 --> 00:54:39.976
ROBINSON. SHE'S A TEACHER

00:54:40.043 --> 00:54:43.179
HERSELF, BUT BUT CAME TO SOME

00:54:43.246 --> 00:54:44.347
REALIZATIONS AS THEY STRUGGLED

00:54:44.414 --> 00:54:45.548
THROUGH HOW TO TEACH ABOUT

00:54:45.615 --> 00:54:47.083
REALLY TOUGH SUBJECTS IN A, IN

00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:48.718
A, IN A VERY COMPLICATED TIME.

00:54:48.785 --> 00:54:51.388
AND I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:54:51.454 --> 00:54:55.158
MEET ONE OF MISS IGRAS STUDENT

00:54:55.225 --> 00:54:57.694
STUDENTS. RIGHT. MISS ROBINSON,

00:54:57.761 --> 00:54:58.928
STUDENT THE OTHER DAY AND TALK

00:54:58.995 --> 00:55:01.097
ABOUT HER PROJECT THAT SHE JUST

00:55:01.164 --> 00:55:02.465
DID IN CLASS. SHE SAID, YOU

00:55:02.532 --> 00:55:04.401
KNOW, A LOT OF MY FRIENDS, WE

00:55:04.467 --> 00:55:06.302
JUST READ A CHAPTER FROM ANNE

00:55:06.369 --> 00:55:09.472
FRANK AND YOU MOVE ON. AND

00:55:09.539 --> 00:55:12.275
INSTEAD, MISS ROBINSON HAD THE

00:55:12.342 --> 00:55:14.778
COURAGE TO REALLY DIG INTO TOUGH

00:55:14.844 --> 00:55:17.814
SUBJECT MATTER THAT FOR

00:55:17.881 --> 00:55:18.948
ESPECIALLY FOR NON-JEWISH

00:55:19.015 --> 00:55:20.784
STUDENTS, BUT EVEN FOR JEWISH

00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:24.954
STUDENTS, MAY SEEM FOREIGN,

00:55:25.021 --> 00:55:27.824
UNCOMFORTABLE AND KIND OF

00:55:27.891 --> 00:55:29.292
UNIMAGINABLE. MY FATHER IN LAW,

00:55:29.359 --> 00:55:30.694
MAY HIS MEMORY BE A BLESSING.

00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:33.363
USED TO SAY, HOW CAN YOU BELIEVE

00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:34.431
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME IF I CAN'T

00:55:34.497 --> 00:55:36.399
EVEN BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED TO

00:55:36.466 --> 00:55:38.702
ME? BUT YOU FIND WAYS AND

00:55:38.768 --> 00:55:40.970
THROUGH NOT JUST READING BOOKS,

00:55:41.037 --> 00:55:43.707
BUT THROUGH ART, INTROSPECTION,

00:55:43.773 --> 00:55:45.975
POETRY, USING OTHER TOOLS, WE'VE

00:55:46.042 --> 00:55:47.143
SEEN A VIBRANCY WAKE UP WITHIN

00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:48.411
OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM AND

00:55:48.478 --> 00:55:50.547
TEACHING ABOUT GENOCIDE AND THE

00:55:50.613 --> 00:55:52.716
HOLOCAUST THAT I THINK IS A IS A

00:55:52.782 --> 00:55:54.617
RARE BRIGHT SPOT. IN A MOMENT OF

00:55:54.684 --> 00:55:57.020
RISING HATE. WE'VE WE JUST HAD

00:55:57.087 --> 00:55:58.521
OUR MOST RECENT COHORT AT THE

00:55:58.588 --> 00:56:00.323
COLLABORATIVE A COUPLE WEEKS AGO

00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:02.459
OR WHAT WAS IT A WEEK AGO. I'VE

00:56:02.525 --> 00:56:06.129
LOST TRACK OF TIME AND WE ALL

00:56:06.196 --> 00:56:08.131
GATHERED AT USC. AND YOU'VE

00:56:08.198 --> 00:56:09.632
NEVER MET A MORE DIVERSE GROUP

00:56:09.699 --> 00:56:11.401
OF PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THIS

00:56:11.468 --> 00:56:14.337
STATE. ETHNIC STUDIES TEACHERS

00:56:14.404 --> 00:56:17.874
FROM CALEXICO UP TO, YOU KNOW,

00:56:17.941 --> 00:56:20.410
RURAL NORTH TEACHERS IN SOME OF

00:56:20.477 --> 00:56:21.411
THE MOST CONSERVATIVE

00:56:21.478 --> 00:56:23.680
COMMUNITIES IN OUR STATE, SOCIAL

00:56:23.747 --> 00:56:25.482
STUDIES TEACHERS, MATH TEACHERS,

00:56:25.548 --> 00:56:27.650
EVERYONE TRYING TO FIND WAYS

00:56:27.717 --> 00:56:29.252
THROUGH THIS MOMENT AND TO TEACH

00:56:29.319 --> 00:56:31.421
OUR WAY THROUGH IT. AND SO I'M

00:56:31.488 --> 00:56:32.222
REALLY PROUD THAT THIS MEASURE

00:56:32.288 --> 00:56:35.291
IS COMING TO YOU TODAY. IT WILL

00:56:35.358 --> 00:56:37.127
DO TWO VERY SIMPLE THINGS. ONE

00:56:37.193 --> 00:56:38.595
IS JUST A REMINDER HOW THE

00:56:38.661 --> 00:56:40.964
EDUCATION CODE WORKS, THAT IT

00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:43.566
INCLUDES EXPLICIT MENTIONS OF

00:56:43.633 --> 00:56:46.770
THE HOLOCAUST AS WELL AS OF

00:56:46.836 --> 00:56:48.605
SLAVERY, AND TO HAVE THAT PUT ON

00:56:48.671 --> 00:56:50.406
NOTICE FOR THOSE LEAS OUT THERE

00:56:50.473 --> 00:56:52.909
THAT MAY NOT BE AWARE OF THAT,

00:56:52.976 --> 00:56:53.543
OR EVEN THOSE TEACHERS WHO MAY

00:56:53.610 --> 00:56:55.111
NOT BE AWARE OF THAT, WE FOUND

00:56:55.178 --> 00:56:57.680
IN A RECENT SURVEY, THE GOVERNOR

00:56:57.747 --> 00:56:58.982
CONVENED A COUNCIL THAT I CHAIR

00:56:59.048 --> 00:57:00.116
AND ABOUT 26% OF THE STATE.

00:57:00.183 --> 00:57:02.652
SORRY, LET'S FLIP THAT. 74% OF

00:57:02.719 --> 00:57:06.256
THE STATE SAID THAT WOULD NOT

00:57:06.322 --> 00:57:07.323
SAY THAT THEY TEACH ANYTHING

00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:09.092
ABOUT HOLOCAUST OR GENOCIDE

00:57:09.159 --> 00:57:10.493
WHATSOEVER IN THEIR CLASSES. IN

00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:11.361
OTHER WORDS, ABOUT THREE

00:57:11.427 --> 00:57:13.062
QUARTERS OF OUR SCHOOLS COULDN'T

00:57:13.129 --> 00:57:14.330
ATTEST TO THE FACT THAT THEY HAD

00:57:14.397 --> 00:57:16.733
ANY KIND OF PROGRAMING OR

00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:17.567
CURRICULUM OR TRAINING OR

00:57:17.634 --> 00:57:18.835
ANYTHING FOR THEIR TEACHERS.

00:57:18.902 --> 00:57:20.236
THEY'RE JUST SORT OF ON THEIR

00:57:20.303 --> 00:57:21.905
OWN. AND THEY COULDN'T SPECIFY

00:57:21.971 --> 00:57:23.439
IN OUR SURVEY WHETHER THEY WERE

00:57:23.506 --> 00:57:24.340
EVEN TEACHING ABOUT THESE

00:57:24.407 --> 00:57:25.909
SUBJECTS AT ALL. AND THAT'S A

00:57:25.975 --> 00:57:27.677
REALLY SCARY THING. WHEN THE

00:57:27.744 --> 00:57:30.113
MAJORITY, AGAIN, THE MAJORITY OF

00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:32.749
OUR DISTRICTS IN THE STATE NEED

00:57:32.816 --> 00:57:33.750
RESOURCES, THEY NEED TOOLS, AND

00:57:33.817 --> 00:57:35.385
THEY NEED SOME GUIDANCE. SO THIS

00:57:35.451 --> 00:57:36.920
GIVES A NOTICE. AND IT ALSO

00:57:36.986 --> 00:57:38.121
GIVES THE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:57:38.188 --> 00:57:39.689
ESTABLISH A GRANTS PROGRAM.

00:57:39.756 --> 00:57:41.524
WE'VE WE'VE BEEN GENEROUS ENOUGH

00:57:41.591 --> 00:57:42.425
TO APPROPRIATE SOME MONEY OVER

00:57:42.492 --> 00:57:44.060
THE PAST FEW YEARS FOR TEACHER

00:57:44.127 --> 00:57:45.795
TRAINING. AND IT'S GOING REALLY

00:57:45.862 --> 00:57:48.665
WELL. AND WE'RE WE'RE FUNDED FOR

00:57:48.731 --> 00:57:50.900
ANOTHER TWO, THREE YEARS HERE.

00:57:50.967 --> 00:57:54.804
AND THE GOAL IS TO TRAIN ABOUT

00:57:54.871 --> 00:57:56.573
8500 TEACHERS AROUND CALIFORNIA

00:57:56.639 --> 00:57:59.509
AND EVENTUALLY TO REACH ABOUT A

00:57:59.576 --> 00:58:00.376
MILLION STUDENTS TO MAKE SURE

00:58:00.443 --> 00:58:01.344
THAT EVERY SOCIAL STUDIES

00:58:01.411 --> 00:58:03.346
TEACHER, YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE

00:58:03.413 --> 00:58:05.515
LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE A MISS

00:58:05.582 --> 00:58:07.116
ROBINSON WHO CAN DO IT ON THEIR

00:58:07.183 --> 00:58:09.219
OWN, GREAT. BUT FOR THOSE WHO

00:58:09.285 --> 00:58:10.286
AND IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE BLESSED

00:58:10.353 --> 00:58:11.621
ENOUGH TO MISS A MISS, AMAZING.

00:58:11.688 --> 00:58:13.056
BUT FOR THOSE WHO DON'T, AREN'T

00:58:13.122 --> 00:58:14.624
BLESSED IN THAT WAY, WE NEED

00:58:14.691 --> 00:58:16.426
OTHER TOOLS. SO THIS BILL

00:58:16.492 --> 00:58:18.127
HOPEFULLY MOVES THAT FORWARD.

00:58:18.194 --> 00:58:19.963
I'LL TURN OVER THE MIC TO MISS

00:58:20.029 --> 00:58:23.967
EAGER. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK

00:58:24.033 --> 00:58:28.171
YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE. I AM A

00:58:28.238 --> 00:58:30.707
CHILD'S HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR AND I

00:58:30.773 --> 00:58:33.943
AM A TEACHER. I'VE BEEN A

00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:38.982
TEACHER ALL MY ADULT LIFE. I

00:58:39.048 --> 00:58:41.918
DECIDED TO START CENTRAL VALLEY

00:58:41.985 --> 00:58:44.520
HOLOCAUST EDUCATORS NETWORK 16

00:58:44.587 --> 00:58:47.390
YEARS AGO WHEN AT A CONFERENCE

00:58:47.457 --> 00:58:49.125
SPONSORED BY THE US HOLOCAUST

00:58:49.192 --> 00:58:51.761
MEMORIAL MUSEUM, I MET TEACHERS

00:58:51.828 --> 00:58:54.163
WHO SAID, IT'S FINE TO KNOW THIS

00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:56.599
HISTORY, BUT HOW DO I TEACH IT?

00:58:56.666 --> 00:59:00.236
SO MY GOAL HAS BEEN TO HELP

00:59:00.303 --> 00:59:03.806
TEACHERS TEACH THIS HISTORY. THE

00:59:03.873 --> 00:59:05.742
REASON? MY REASON FOR TEACHING

00:59:05.808 --> 00:59:08.211
THIS HISTORY IS NOT BECAUSE IT'S

00:59:08.278 --> 00:59:11.781
MY HISTORY. IT'S THE MOST THE

00:59:11.848 --> 00:59:16.786
BEST DOCUMENTED GENOCIDE

00:59:16.853 --> 00:59:21.157
DOCUMENTED BY THE PERPETRATORS,

00:59:21.224 --> 00:59:23.626
METICULOUSLY ORGANIZED AND

00:59:23.693 --> 00:59:28.398
ACCESSIBLE AND MEMORIALIZED AND

00:59:28.464 --> 00:59:31.167
ADMITTED BY THE PERPETRATORS.

00:59:31.234 --> 00:59:33.703
AND THAT WE HAVE. THERE IS MUCH

00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:39.876
TO BE LEARNED. AND THE FIRST.

00:59:39.943 --> 00:59:42.812
THING THAT HAPPENED, IF YOU LOOK

00:59:42.879 --> 00:59:46.316
AT THE WAY THE LAWS WERE PASSED

00:59:46.382 --> 00:59:50.653
IN NAZI GERMANY THAT LED TO THE

00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:54.290
HOLOCAUST, THE FIRST THING WAS

00:59:54.357 --> 00:59:58.261
EDUCATION. I COULD SPEAK JUST

00:59:58.328 --> 01:00:01.431
ABOUT THE EDUCATION IN GERMANY,

01:00:01.497 --> 01:00:04.767
BUT I THINK AT THIS MOMENT IN

01:00:04.834 --> 01:00:08.004
OUR HISTORY, IT BEHOOVES US THAT

01:00:08.071 --> 01:00:11.507
THIS HISTORY BE TAUGHT WELL,

01:00:11.574 --> 01:00:15.912
THAT IT WILL BE ACCESSIBLE AND

01:00:15.979 --> 01:00:20.683
UNDERSTOOD, AND I HOPE THAT

01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:23.119
CALIFORNIA SUPPORTS THIS LATEST

01:00:23.186 --> 01:00:25.154
BILL THAT WILL HELP US DO THAT

01:00:25.221 --> 01:00:28.958
WORK. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

01:00:29.025 --> 01:00:30.994
ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TO YOU. I

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:33.496
WOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO ANSWER

01:00:33.563 --> 01:00:36.766
ANY QUESTIONS, ANY TIME NOW OR

01:00:36.833 --> 01:00:38.901
ANY OTHER TIME. THANK YOU VERY

01:00:38.968 --> 01:00:42.572

01:00:46.943 --> 01:00:48.378
CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY

01:00:48.444 --> 01:00:50.446
NAME IS ANDRE ROBINSON AND I'M A

01:00:50.513 --> 01:00:51.948
PROUD SEVENTH AND EIGHTH GRADE

01:00:52.015 --> 01:00:53.583
ENGLISH TEACHER OF 13 YEARS. AND

01:00:53.649 --> 01:00:55.118
I CURRENTLY TEACH AT MIWOK

01:00:55.184 --> 01:00:56.586
MIDDLE SCHOOL RIGHT HERE IN

01:00:56.652 --> 01:00:58.121
SACRAMENTO. TODAY, I'D LIKE TO

01:00:58.187 --> 01:01:00.223
BEGIN NOT WITH MY OWN WORDS, BUT

01:01:00.289 --> 01:01:01.824
WITH THE VOICES OF MY STUDENTS.

01:01:01.891 --> 01:01:03.126
EVERY JUNE, MY CLASS IS

01:01:03.192 --> 01:01:04.994
COMPLETE. A YEAR END SURVEY. ONE

01:01:05.061 --> 01:01:07.663
OF THE QUESTIONS ASKS, WHAT WAS

01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:09.332
YOUR FAVORITE THING WE STUDIED

01:01:09.399 --> 01:01:11.067
THIS YEAR AND WHY?

01:01:11.134 --> 01:01:11.968
OVERWHELMINGLY, MY STUDENTS NAME

01:01:12.035 --> 01:01:14.037
OUR UNIT ON THE BOOK NIGHT IN

01:01:14.103 --> 01:01:15.738
THE HOLOCAUST. I BROUGHT SEVERAL

01:01:15.805 --> 01:01:17.473
OF THEIR RESPONSES WITH ME

01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:20.076
TODAY. HERE ARE JUST A FEW. MY

01:01:20.143 --> 01:01:21.411
FAVORITE THING WAS LEARNING

01:01:21.477 --> 01:01:22.045
ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST, BECAUSE I

01:01:22.111 --> 01:01:23.813
GOT TO READ A FIRSTHAND ACCOUNT

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:25.515
OF WHAT HAPPENED, WHICH REALLY

01:01:25.581 --> 01:01:28.684
CHANGED MY PERSPECTIVE. THE

01:01:28.751 --> 01:01:30.086
HOLOCAUST, BECAUSE WE MET A

01:01:30.153 --> 01:01:31.554
HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR AND THE

01:01:31.621 --> 01:01:33.256
HOLOCAUST IS AN IMPORTANT THING

01:01:33.322 --> 01:01:36.225
THAT ISN'T TALKED ABOUT ENOUGH.

01:01:36.292 --> 01:01:37.627
MY FAVORITE THING WE STUDY THIS

01:01:37.693 --> 01:01:40.129
YEAR WAS THE HOLOCAUST, BECAUSE

01:01:40.196 --> 01:01:43.032
MY FAMILY HAS DEALT WITH IT.

01:01:43.099 --> 01:01:44.500
THOUGH THIS UNIT HAS CLEARLY HAD

01:01:44.567 --> 01:01:46.702
A DEEP IMPACT ON MY STUDENTS, I

01:01:46.769 --> 01:01:48.438
ONLY BEGAN TEACHING IT A FEW

01:01:48.504 --> 01:01:50.540
YEARS AGO BECAUSE A COLLEAGUE

01:01:50.606 --> 01:01:52.742
EXPOSED ME TO UNIT SHE HAD

01:01:52.809 --> 01:01:54.243
DEVELOPED. BEFORE THAT I HAD

01:01:54.310 --> 01:01:56.412
NEVER RECEIVED TRAINING TO HELP

01:01:56.479 --> 01:01:58.114
GUIDE STUDENTS THROUGH SUCH AN

01:01:58.181 --> 01:02:00.283
IMPORTANT AND SENSITIVE TOPIC. I

01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:02.418
WASN'T AWARE THAT IT WAS PART OF

01:02:02.485 --> 01:02:04.253
CALIFORNIA ED CODE, AND INDEED

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:06.255
MOST TEACHERS ARE NOT. THERE IS

01:02:06.322 --> 01:02:08.224
A LACK OF CLARITY AROUND THE

01:02:08.291 --> 01:02:09.258
REQUIREMENT, WHICH LEAVES IT UP

01:02:09.325 --> 01:02:11.527
TO AN INDIVIDUAL TEACHER WHO MAY

01:02:11.594 --> 01:02:12.862
BE INTERESTED IN THE SUBJECT

01:02:12.929 --> 01:02:14.697
MATTER TO FIGURE IT OUT

01:02:14.764 --> 01:02:16.866
THEMSELVES. I CONSIDER MYSELF

01:02:16.933 --> 01:02:18.234
INCREDIBLY FORTUNATE TO WORK

01:02:18.301 --> 01:02:20.470
ALONGSIDE THOUGHTFUL, PASSIONATE

01:02:20.536 --> 01:02:22.338
EDUCATORS WHO POINTED ME TOWARD

01:02:22.405 --> 01:02:24.140
HOLOCAUST AND GENOCIDE EDUCATION

01:02:24.207 --> 01:02:25.074
EVENTS AND PROFESSIONAL

01:02:25.141 --> 01:02:27.376
DEVELOPMENT. OPPORTUNITIES,

01:02:27.443 --> 01:02:28.277
OPPORTUNITIES AND EXPERIENCES

01:02:28.344 --> 01:02:29.846
LIKE THIS HAVE BEEN

01:02:29.912 --> 01:02:30.480
TRANSFORMATIVE IN PROVIDING ME

01:02:30.546 --> 01:02:33.015
PRACTICAL RESOURCES TO TEACH MY

01:02:33.082 --> 01:02:35.218
STUDENTS ABOUT THE PAST SO THAT

01:02:35.284 --> 01:02:37.019
THEY CAN CREATE A BETTER FUTURE

01:02:37.086 --> 01:02:38.921
CENTERED ON JUSTICE, COMPASSION,

01:02:38.988 --> 01:02:41.290
AND UNDERSTANDING. TEACHERS

01:02:41.357 --> 01:02:42.692
ACROSS CALIFORNIA ARE

01:02:42.758 --> 01:02:44.827
CHRONICALLY OVERWHELMED AND

01:02:44.894 --> 01:02:45.962
UNDER-RESOURCED. A BILL LIKE

01:02:46.028 --> 01:02:47.897
THIS ONE THAT BOTH REINFORCES

01:02:47.964 --> 01:02:49.966
THE IMPORTANCE OF HOLOCAUST AND

01:02:50.032 --> 01:02:51.901
GENOCIDE EDUCATION AND ENSURES

01:02:51.968 --> 01:02:53.903
THAT EDUCATORS ARE SUPPORTED IN

01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:56.339
DOING THIS WORK, DEMONSTRATES

01:02:56.405 --> 01:02:58.307
MEANINGFUL CARE NOT JUST FOR

01:02:58.374 --> 01:02:59.642
TEACHERS, BUT FOR THE FUTURE

01:02:59.709 --> 01:03:01.811
GENERATIONS THAT WE TEACH. AS AN

01:03:01.878 --> 01:03:03.212
EDUCATOR, I BELIEVE DEEPLY IN

01:03:03.279 --> 01:03:05.381
THAT RESPONSIBILITY, BUT WE

01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:08.217
CANNOT DO IT ALONE. WE NEED THE

01:03:08.284 --> 01:03:10.052
AWARENESS, THE TOOLS, THE

01:03:10.119 --> 01:03:11.554
TRAINING AND THE TIME TO DO IT

01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:13.756
WELL. TO THAT END, I ASK FOR

01:03:13.823 --> 01:03:15.925
YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL.

01:03:15.992 --> 01:03:18.761

KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO BE

01:07:41.557 --> 01:07:42.825
POSSIBLE FOR ALL STUDENTS IN THE

01:07:42.892 --> 01:07:44.994
UNITED STATES TO BE ABLE TO SEE

01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:47.263
THOSE THINGS. BUT IT IS SO

01:07:47.329 --> 01:07:49.732
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR ALL

01:07:49.799 --> 01:07:53.402
STUDENTS TO HAVE THIS AS

01:07:53.469 --> 01:07:54.937
FUNDAMENTAL, FOUNDATIONAL PART

01:07:55.004 --> 01:07:57.006
OF THEIR EDUCATION. AGAIN, NOT

01:07:57.072 --> 01:07:58.707
JUST TO LEARN ABOUT THE JEWISH

01:07:58.774 --> 01:08:01.043
CULTURE, BUT ABOUT ALL CULTURES

01:08:01.110 --> 01:08:03.746
AND THE INHUMANITY THAT CAN TAKE

01:08:03.813 --> 01:08:08.617
PLACE UNDER OUR WATCH, HOW

01:08:08.684 --> 01:08:11.253
PROPAGANDA CAN RISE AND HOW

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:12.788
PEOPLE CANNOT EVEN KNOW WHAT

01:08:12.855 --> 01:08:14.990
THEY'RE FOLLOWING NECESSARILY

01:08:15.057 --> 01:08:17.827
UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE. AND IN THIS

01:08:17.893 --> 01:08:20.329
WORLD OF DISINFORMATION, IN THIS

01:08:20.396 --> 01:08:24.066
WORLD TODAY, WHERE PEOPLE ARE

01:08:24.133 --> 01:08:26.502
TRULY STRUGGLING, YOU KNOW, TO

01:08:26.569 --> 01:08:28.971
KNOW WHAT JUSTICE IS AND WHAT IT

01:08:29.038 --> 01:08:30.139
ISN'T, IT IS SO VITALLY

01:08:30.206 --> 01:08:32.374
IMPORTANT THAT IN OUR CURRICULA

01:08:32.441 --> 01:08:34.276
THAT IN OUR SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION

01:08:34.343 --> 01:08:38.848
THAT WE HAVE VEHICLES LIKE THIS.

01:08:38.914 --> 01:08:40.983
SO I'M PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS

01:08:41.050 --> 01:08:42.184
TODAY. AND FINALLY, I JUST WANT

01:08:42.251 --> 01:08:44.587
TO SAY TO ALL MY COLLEAGUES HERE

01:08:44.653 --> 01:08:46.288
IN ANY OTHER YEAR, THIS WOULD BE

01:08:46.355 --> 01:08:49.125
A JEWISH CAUCUS PRIORITY BILL.

01:08:49.191 --> 01:08:50.493
THIS YEAR, THE LEGISLATIVE

01:08:50.559 --> 01:08:53.028
JEWISH CAUCUS HAS CHOSEN ONLY

01:08:53.095 --> 01:08:54.163
ONE PRIORITY BILL FOR VERY

01:08:54.230 --> 01:08:57.199
SPECIFIC REASONS. BUT HAD THIS

01:08:57.266 --> 01:08:58.300
BILL BEEN FORWARD, I'M QUITE

01:08:58.367 --> 01:09:00.469
CERTAIN THAT IT WOULD BE ONE OF

01:09:00.536 --> 01:09:02.104
OUR PRIORITY CAUCUS PRIORITY

01:09:02.171 --> 01:09:03.239
BILLS. SO THANK YOU AGAIN,

01:09:03.305 --> 01:09:04.240

01:09:04.306 --> 01:09:08.043

HEARD THOSE STATISTICS, I TALKED

01:09:40.242 --> 01:09:42.044
WITH MY DAUGHTER AND I ASKED,

01:09:42.111 --> 01:09:45.180
YOU KNOW, SHE'S A GOING TO BE A

01:09:45.247 --> 01:09:48.017
JUNIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL NEXT YEAR.

01:09:48.083 --> 01:09:50.119
BUT YEAH, JUST CHECKING ON, YOU

AND, AND HOW MUCH WHAT IS BEING

01:09:54.456 --> 01:09:59.828
TAUGHT IN HER SCHOOLS. AND I WAS

01:09:59.895 --> 01:10:03.432
I WAS HAPPY AND ENCOURAGED THAT

01:10:03.499 --> 01:10:05.634
SHE WAS LEARNING MUCH MORE ABOUT

01:10:05.701 --> 01:10:08.470
THE HOLOCAUST THAN, THAN I

01:10:08.537 --> 01:10:12.341
LEARNED WHEN I WENT TO. PUBLIC

01:10:12.408 --> 01:10:16.245
SCHOOLS. AND SO I, YOU KNOW,

01:10:16.312 --> 01:10:18.747
HOPEFULLY WE SEE THAT AS AN

01:10:18.814 --> 01:10:20.950
INDICATION OF PROGRESS AND THAT

01:10:21.016 --> 01:10:22.418
YOUR MEASURE IS GOING TO HELP

01:10:22.484 --> 01:10:25.721
MAKE SURE THAT THAT HAPPENS IN

01:10:25.788 --> 01:10:27.222
ALL SCHOOLS, THROUGHOUT ALL

01:10:27.289 --> 01:10:28.123

01:10:28.190 --> 01:10:30.559

THE JEWISH TRADITION IS TO CHASE

01:10:47.343 --> 01:10:51.747
JUSTICE. THE, THE WORDS FROM,

01:10:51.814 --> 01:10:53.248
FROM THE OLD TESTAMENT ARE

01:10:53.315 --> 01:10:57.820
CLEAR. OUR JOB IS NOT JUST TO

01:10:57.886 --> 01:11:00.155
TRY TO ELEVATE OR EXCEPTIONALIZE

01:11:00.222 --> 01:11:04.159
THE SUFFERING THAT YOUR FAMILY

01:11:04.226 --> 01:11:05.661
HAS BEEN THROUGH. MY FAMILY'S

01:11:05.728 --> 01:11:08.364

01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:09.965
LOOK OUT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE LEFT

01:11:10.032 --> 01:11:11.567

INHUMANITY IS A DIRECT QUOTE.

01:11:17.973 --> 01:11:19.308
ACTUALLY, YOU GOT THE ED CODE

01:11:19.375 --> 01:11:21.243
QUITE RIGHT. IT'S THE INHUMANITY

01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:23.379
OF GENOCIDE, SLAVERY AND THE

01:11:23.445 --> 01:11:27.182
HOLOCAUST. AND THESE THINGS THAT

01:11:27.249 --> 01:11:28.450
ARE SO DIVISIVE, I THINK CAN

01:11:28.517 --> 01:11:31.553
ACTUALLY START TO UNIFY US. SO I

01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:33.689
HOPE THIS BILL'S A MEASURE IN

01:11:33.756 --> 01:11:34.923
THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND WOULD

01:11:34.990 --> 01:11:36.525

01:13:12.087 --> 01:13:13.822
MONTHS AGO, IN MY DISTRICT OF

01:13:13.889 --> 01:13:15.591

ARMED AND WERE ASKING FOR

01:13:27.603 --> 01:13:32.508

A IN A SCHOOL DISTRICT IN SAN

01:24:28.129 --> 01:24:31.199
DIEGO COUNTY, I HAVE SEEN THE

01:24:31.266 --> 01:24:33.368
IMPACTS THAT FEAR CAN HAVE ON

01:24:33.435 --> 01:24:34.469
OUR CHILDREN AND OUR

01:24:34.536 --> 01:24:36.237
COMMUNITIES. WHAT WE KNOW IS

01:24:36.304 --> 01:24:38.306
THAT IF CHILDREN ARE NOT SAFE,

01:24:38.373 --> 01:24:40.208
IF THEY DO NOT FEEL SAFE, THEY

01:24:40.275 --> 01:24:41.576
ARE NOT LEARNING. AND THAT IS

01:24:41.643 --> 01:24:43.912
THE PRIMARY GOAL OF OUR PUBLIC

01:24:43.978 --> 01:24:45.313
EDUCATION SYSTEM HERE IN

01:24:45.380 --> 01:24:46.681
CALIFORNIA. WE WANT OUR STUDENTS

01:24:46.748 --> 01:24:49.217
TO FEEL SAFE AND WE WANT THEM TO

01:24:49.284 --> 01:24:49.984
LEARN. AND CERTAINLY THE POINTS

01:24:50.051 --> 01:24:51.386
THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP THAT

01:24:51.453 --> 01:24:54.122
THERE WOULD BE WITH FEAR OF

01:24:54.189 --> 01:24:55.757
STAYING HOME AND NOT ATTENDING

01:24:55.824 --> 01:24:57.091
SCHOOL, THERE'S THE IMMEDIATE

01:24:57.158 --> 01:24:59.260
LOSS OF ADA FUNDING. THAT IS

01:24:59.327 --> 01:25:01.029
CERTAINLY THE SHORT TERM IMPACT,

01:25:01.095 --> 01:25:02.497
BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO CONSIDER THE

01:25:02.564 --> 01:25:03.998
LONG TERM IMPACTS. AND THAT'S

01:25:04.065 --> 01:25:05.767
WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT YOU

01:25:05.834 --> 01:25:07.168
BROUGHT THIS BILL FORWARD. THE

01:25:07.235 --> 01:25:09.037
LONG TERM IMPACTS TO A CHILD'S

01:25:09.103 --> 01:25:11.239
EDUCATIONAL TRAJECTORY AND THEIR

01:25:11.306 --> 01:25:12.607
FUTURE, THE LONG TERM IMPACTS

01:25:12.674 --> 01:25:14.442
WITH GENERATIONAL TRAUMA THAT

01:25:14.509 --> 01:25:16.444
WILL BE PASSED ON NOT JUST TO

01:25:16.511 --> 01:25:17.712
THE INDIVIDUAL CHILD OR THE

01:25:17.779 --> 01:25:19.180
FAMILY EXPERIENCING IT, BUT TO

01:25:19.247 --> 01:25:21.182
THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE. AND

01:25:21.249 --> 01:25:22.884
THE LONG TERM IMPACT TO

01:25:22.951 --> 01:25:23.718
CALIFORNIA WHEN OUR CHILDREN ARE

01:25:23.785 --> 01:25:26.287
NOT ABLE TO ADEQUATELY LEARN AND

01:25:26.354 --> 01:25:27.388
ENTER THE WORKFORCE AND

01:25:27.455 --> 01:25:29.491
CONTRIBUTE TO OUR ECONOMY. SO I

COMMUNITY MEMBERS COMING OUT,

01:26:07.829 --> 01:26:10.365
UNITING TO DEFINE THE CULTURE OF

01:26:10.431 --> 01:26:12.300
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HERE

01:26:12.367 --> 01:26:14.168
TODAY. AND WE STAND WITH YOU AND

01:26:14.235 --> 01:26:16.070
YOU GIVE US SUCH INCREDIBLE

01:26:16.137 --> 01:26:17.939
ENERGY IN DOING SO. SO THANK YOU

01:26:18.006 --> 01:26:20.241
FOR YOUR ADVOCACY. AND WE ALL

01:26:20.308 --> 01:26:23.545
NEED TO CONTINUE DOWN THAT ROAD.

JUST VERY BRIEFLY, I WANT TO

01:26:24.445 --> 01:26:27.782
STATE THE OBVIOUS. WE WOULD NOT

01:26:27.849 --> 01:26:29.951
NEED THIS POLICY IF THE FEDERAL

01:26:30.018 --> 01:26:32.820
ADMINISTRATION WAS BEING HONEST,

01:26:32.887 --> 01:26:34.455
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE

01:26:34.522 --> 01:26:37.158
BEING DISHONEST. EVEN WHEN ASKED

01:26:37.225 --> 01:26:38.993
WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE TRYING

01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:41.596
TO GO TO SCHOOLS, THEY SAY NO AT

01:26:41.663 --> 01:26:44.098
EVERY OPPORTUNITY. AND WE HAVE

01:26:44.165 --> 01:26:47.502
VIDEO SHOWING OTHERWISE. SO THIS

01:26:47.569 --> 01:26:49.237
POLICY IS DESPERATELY NEEDED.

01:26:49.304 --> 01:26:51.406
THANK YOU AGAIN FOR BRINGING IT

01:26:51.472 --> 01:26:56.411

APPRECIATE YOU INCLUDING ME IN

01:27:08.856 --> 01:27:10.391
THIS. I ALSO JUST WANT TO SAY

01:27:10.458 --> 01:27:13.161
THAT THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION

01:27:13.227 --> 01:27:16.064
IS A PART OF PROBABLY NEARLY TWO

01:27:16.130 --> 01:27:19.701
DOZEN OTHER BILLS THAT ARE

01:27:19.767 --> 01:27:21.436
PASSING THROUGH THIS LEGISLATURE

01:27:21.502 --> 01:27:24.038
WITH URGENCY, ALL ON THE TOPIC

01:27:24.105 --> 01:27:27.175

IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW,

01:27:43.524 --> 01:27:45.560
PARTICULARLY IN LOS ANGELES, AS

01:27:45.627 --> 01:27:48.029
SO MANY PEOPLE ARE BEING FORCED

01:27:48.096 --> 01:27:49.597
INTO THE SHADOWS WHERE THEY DO

01:27:49.664 --> 01:27:53.234
NOT BELONG BECAUSE OF THE HORROR

01:27:53.301 --> 01:27:57.138

THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION

01:27:59.941 --> 01:28:01.776
ANYMORE, THAT THE TRUMP

01:28:01.843 --> 01:28:03.911
ADMINISTRATION IS WREAKING ON

01:28:03.978 --> 01:28:05.046
OUR COMMUNITIES. I WANT TO THANK

EARLY ON IN THE LEGISLATIVE

01:28:35.343 --> 01:28:38.112
PROCESS WHEN WE BOTH INTRODUCED

01:28:38.179 --> 01:28:41.516
VERY SIMILAR MEASURES DESIGNED

01:28:41.582 --> 01:28:45.019
TO WORK TOGETHER TO PROTECT OUR

01:28:45.086 --> 01:28:48.256

01:28:52.193 --> 01:28:55.196
EFFORT, TOGETHER WITH, OF

COURSE, OUR SUPERINTENDENT AND,

01:28:57.965 --> 01:29:04.005
AND OUR TEACHERS. AND SO HAPPY

01:29:14.215 --> 01:29:15.416
SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH. THIS IS

01:29:15.483 --> 01:29:17.418
VERY PERSONAL TO SO MANY OF US,

01:29:17.485 --> 01:29:18.953
AND I THANK THE COMMENTS FROM

01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:20.621
ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THE

01:29:20.688 --> 01:29:21.355
CO-AUTHORSHIPS AND OF COURSE,

01:29:21.422 --> 01:29:22.356
YOUR PARTNERSHIP. MR. CHAIR,

01:29:22.423 --> 01:29:23.591
IT'S PERSONAL BECAUSE SO MANY OF

01:29:23.658 --> 01:29:25.193
US ARE OUR MOTHERS AND PARENTS

01:29:25.259 --> 01:29:26.060
OF CHILDREN THAT ARE IN

01:29:26.127 --> 01:29:27.962
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. MY CHILD IS

01:29:28.029 --> 01:29:29.530
IN A LONG BEACH UNIFIED SCHOOL

01:29:29.597 --> 01:29:31.099
DISTRICT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. AND

01:29:31.165 --> 01:29:32.200
WHAT I'VE SAID, AND I'LL SAY

01:29:32.266 --> 01:29:33.768
AGAIN, IS HE'S BEEN SLEEPING

01:29:33.835 --> 01:29:35.603
WITH ME FOR THE LAST TWO WEEKS

01:29:35.670 --> 01:29:37.205
BECAUSE HE'S A MEXICAN KID AND

01:29:37.271 --> 01:29:38.873
FEELS LIKE HE COULD BE PICKED UP

01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:41.142
AT ANY TIME. THAT IS REALLY

01:29:41.209 --> 01:29:43.277
HORRIBLE FOR SO MANY PARENTS

01:29:43.344 --> 01:29:44.746
THAT DON'T HAVE THE TITLE AND

01:29:44.812 --> 01:29:46.647
PRIVILEGE THAT I DO THAT WE'RE

01:29:46.714 --> 01:29:47.215
REPRESENTING, ESPECIALLY IN

01:29:47.281 --> 01:29:48.382
PLACES LIKE SOUTHEAST LOS

01:29:48.449 --> 01:29:50.118
ANGELES, THAT HAVE BEEN HIT SO

01:29:50.184 --> 01:29:52.019
VERY HARD. NOT ONLY ARE THESE

01:29:52.086 --> 01:29:53.087
FEDERAL AGENTS COMING TO

01:29:53.154 --> 01:29:54.522
SCHOOLS, BUT THEY'RE ALSO

01:29:54.589 --> 01:29:56.290
THROWING FLASH BANGS AND

01:29:56.357 --> 01:29:57.391
PLAYGROUNDS, LIKE IN THE CITY OF

01:29:57.458 --> 01:29:59.093
MAYWOOD, WHERE MR. RAMIREZ IS

01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:01.329
FROM. AND IT'S JUST UNFAIR. IT

01:30:01.395 --> 01:30:03.931
REALLY IS. AND SO THIS, I THINK,

01:30:03.998 --> 01:30:05.466
WILL BE A REALLY GOOD STEP IN

01:30:05.533 --> 01:30:06.901
THE RIGHT DIRECTION WITH

01:30:06.968 --> 01:30:08.469
URGENCY. AND I REALLY THANK YOU

01:30:08.536 --> 01:30:10.037
SO MUCH FOR YOUR COLLABORATION.

01:30:10.104 --> 01:30:11.405
AND WE WILL CONTINUE FIGHTING

01:30:11.472 --> 01:30:12.373
AGAINST THIS ADMINISTRATION AND

01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:14.776
THEIR EGREGIOUS OVERREACH. MR.

01:30:14.842 --> 01:30:16.711
SUPERINTENDENT, THANK YOU,

01:30:16.778 --> 01:30:19.313
SENATOR, FOR YOUR GREAT

01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:20.381
LEADERSHIP. THANK YOU TO THE

01:30:20.448 --> 01:30:21.516
MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AND TO

01:30:21.582 --> 01:30:23.451
THE CHAIR. WE ARE EXCITED TO

01:30:23.518 --> 01:30:25.820
WORK WITH YOU ON YOUR MEASURE

01:30:25.887 --> 01:30:27.255
AND TO ALL THOSE WHO CAME IN

01:30:27.321 --> 01:30:29.590
TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF IT,

01:30:29.657 --> 01:30:31.259
I KNOW YOU ALL NOTICED IT. IT IS

01:30:31.325 --> 01:30:33.027
A RARE OCCASION WHEN THE CHAMBER

01:30:33.094 --> 01:30:35.029
IS FULL OF SUPPORTERS AND NO

01:30:35.096 --> 01:30:37.865
OPPOSITION. BUT EVEN IF THAT

01:30:37.932 --> 01:30:39.467
WERE NOT ENOUGH, THE URGENCY

01:30:39.534 --> 01:30:41.169
CLAUSE IS SO IMPORTANT. IF YOU

01:30:41.235 --> 01:30:43.171
THINK ABOUT THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:30:43.237 --> 01:30:45.173
THAT WILL BEGIN SCHOOL THIS VERY

01:30:45.239 --> 01:30:46.007
MONTH. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

01:30:46.073 --> 01:30:47.642
SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN SAN DIEGO

01:30:47.708 --> 01:30:49.277
COUNTY AND ELSEWHERE THAT BEGIN

01:30:49.343 --> 01:30:50.178
SCHOOL SHORTLY. AND THIS SENDS A

01:30:50.244 --> 01:30:52.046
POWERFUL MESSAGE TO THEM THAT WE

01:30:52.113 --> 01:30:53.514
VALUE THEM AND THAT WE WILL

01:30:53.581 --> 01:30:55.049
PROTECT THEM AGAINST THE TRAUMA

01:30:55.116 --> 01:30:56.684
THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT, CHAIR,

01:30:56.751 --> 01:30:58.152
AND THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT

PERCOLATING ABOUT WHERE ICE IS

01:35:14.842 --> 01:35:16.610

01:35:16.677 --> 01:35:18.312
EFFECTS IN OUR SCHOOLS AND IN

01:35:18.379 --> 01:35:20.848
OUR COMMUNITIES, IT'S IMPORTANT

OUR FAMILIES, AND FOR ALL THE

01:35:31.625 --> 01:35:33.160
REASONS THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED

ABOUT SB 48 AND 98, THESE TWO

OBVIOUSLY ARE WORKING VERY

01:35:36.764 --> 01:35:38.599
CLOSELY TOGETHER. BOTH OF THESE

01:35:38.666 --> 01:35:39.600
MEASURES, BOTH OF THESE MEASURES

01:35:39.667 --> 01:35:41.635

VOICE OF 2.1 MILLION STUDENTS IN

01:36:01.288 --> 01:36:03.891
STRONG SUPPORT OF SB 98. THIS

01:36:03.958 --> 01:36:05.192
BILL MATTERS BECAUSE

01:36:05.259 --> 01:36:06.727
UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS FROM

01:36:06.794 --> 01:36:07.695

RIGHT NOW, THEY DON'T HAVE THAT.

01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:14.301

PRINCIPALS AND DISTRICT STAFF

01:36:15.136 --> 01:36:16.437
FROM TWO ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS IN

THROUGH FIFTH GRADE. CURRENTLY,

01:36:25.813 --> 01:36:27.148
THERE IS NO LAW REQUIRING

01:36:27.214 --> 01:36:28.382
NOTIFICATION TO PARENTS AT THE K

01:36:28.449 --> 01:36:30.551

01:36:30.618 --> 01:36:31.919
IN HIGHER EDUCATION WHEN

01:36:31.986 --> 01:36:32.887
IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS ARE

01:36:32.953 --> 01:36:35.156
PRESENT ON OR NEAR A SCHOOL

01:36:35.222 --> 01:36:36.524
CAMPUS. THIS LACK OF

01:36:36.590 --> 01:36:38.325
COMMUNICATION FOSTERS FEAR,

01:36:38.392 --> 01:36:39.693
CONFUSION, AND SILENCE,

01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:41.362
ESPECIALLY AMONG MIXED STATUS

01:36:41.428 --> 01:36:42.997

01:36:44.865 --> 01:36:46.333
ALREADY SEEING THE REAL IMPACTS

01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:48.402
OF THIS. PROFESSORS REPORT SHARP

01:36:48.469 --> 01:36:50.304
DECLINES IN ATTENDANCE,

01:36:50.371 --> 01:36:52.373
ESPECIALLY IN ESL CLASSES. SOME

01:36:52.439 --> 01:36:54.008
HAVE EVEN MOVED INSTRUCTION BACK

01:36:54.074 --> 01:36:55.609
ON ZOOM, NOT FOR CONVENIENCE,

01:36:55.676 --> 01:36:57.511
BUT OUT OF THE CONCERN FOR THEIR

01:36:57.578 --> 01:36:59.980
STUDENTS. SB 98 IS A CRITICAL

01:37:00.047 --> 01:37:01.549
STEP TOWARD PROTECTING OUR

01:37:01.615 --> 01:37:02.550
STUDENTS AND UPHOLDING THE BASIC

01:37:02.616 --> 01:37:04.318
RIGHT TO EDUCATION. IT WOULD

01:37:04.385 --> 01:37:05.386
REQUIRE SCHOOLS TO NOTIFY

01:37:05.452 --> 01:37:07.254
PARENTS AT THE K THROUGH 12

01:37:07.321 --> 01:37:08.589
LEVEL AND STUDENTS IN HIGHER

01:37:08.656 --> 01:37:09.623
EDUCATION IF IMMIGRATION

01:37:09.690 --> 01:37:11.525
OFFICIALS ARE PRESENT ON CAMPUS

01:37:11.592 --> 01:37:13.260
BY ENSURING TRANSPARENCY, THIS

01:37:13.327 --> 01:37:15.496
BILL WOULD HELP ALLEVIATE FEAR,

01:37:15.563 --> 01:37:17.364
PROTECT OUR UNDOCUMENTED STUDENT

01:37:17.431 --> 01:37:19.166

01:37:36.850 --> 01:37:38.118
ALSO FROM CRITICAL INFORMATION

01:37:38.185 --> 01:37:39.687

TRANSPARENT COMMUNICATION ABOUT

POTENTIAL RISKS ON CAMPUS IS

01:37:45.392 --> 01:37:46.894
FUNDAMENTAL TO PROTECTING THEIR

NOT JUST POLICY, IT'S

01:37:54.101 --> 01:37:55.436

FATHER OF A OF A TEENAGE

WHENEVER I HEAR ABOUT INCIDENTS

TAKING PLACE AT OUR SCHOOLS, IT

01:52:27.574 --> 01:52:30.076
JUST, YOU KNOW, REALLY, REALLY

01:52:30.143 --> 01:52:33.313

WELL, THANK YOU, AND I REALLY

01:53:20.460 --> 01:53:23.563
APPRECIATE THAT. YOU KNOW, I, I,

01:53:23.630 --> 01:53:25.999
I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE BY JUST

01:53:26.065 --> 01:53:27.333
SHARING WITH YOU ALL A LITTLE

01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:29.435
BIT ABOUT HOW THIS CAME ABOUT.

01:53:29.502 --> 01:53:31.704
THE JOURNALISTS THAT I REFER TO

01:53:31.771 --> 01:53:33.506
IN MY TALKING POINTS IS ACTUALLY

01:53:33.573 --> 01:53:36.042
NAMED MATT DRANGE. HE WAS A

01:53:36.109 --> 01:53:37.143
JOURNALIST FOR BUSINESS INSIDER.

01:53:37.210 --> 01:53:38.811
HE WAS ACTUALLY RECENTLY LAID

01:53:38.878 --> 01:53:40.246
OFF. BUT IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO

01:53:40.313 --> 01:53:42.715
LOOK AT HIS WORK, YOU'RE ABLE TO

01:53:42.782 --> 01:53:44.250
DO THAT. HE'S AN INCREDIBLE

01:53:44.317 --> 01:53:46.252
JOURNALIST AND ALSO GRADUATED

01:53:46.319 --> 01:53:48.588
THE SAME YEAR AS I DID AND WENT

01:53:48.655 --> 01:53:50.723
TO ROSEMEAD HIGH SCHOOL, WHICH

01:53:50.790 --> 01:53:52.825
WAS THE TARGET OF HIS

01:53:52.892 --> 01:53:54.727
INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING, WHERE

01:53:54.794 --> 01:53:58.665
HE UNCOVERED THESE CASES. I,

01:53:58.731 --> 01:54:00.767
WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL,

01:54:00.833 --> 01:54:02.202
UNFORTUNATELY, WAS IN A

01:54:02.268 --> 01:54:04.404
SITUATION IN WHICH A STAFF

01:54:04.470 --> 01:54:06.573
MEMBER APPROACHED ME TO TELL ME

01:54:06.639 --> 01:54:08.875
THAT HE HAD ROMANTIC FEELINGS

01:54:08.942 --> 01:54:10.343
FOR ME WHEN I WAS 17 YEARS OLD

01:54:10.410 --> 01:54:12.679
AND HE WAS OVER 20 YEARS MY

01:54:12.745 --> 01:54:15.448
SENIOR. THAT SITUATION REALLY

01:54:15.515 --> 01:54:18.051
STUCK WITH ME FOR MANY YEARS AND

01:54:18.117 --> 01:54:20.553
MADE ME VERY ANGRY. I WAS VERY

01:54:20.620 --> 01:54:22.322
FORTUNATE THAT I UNDERSTOOD THAT

01:54:22.388 --> 01:54:24.257
I NEEDED TO RUN AWAY AND WHAT

01:54:24.324 --> 01:54:26.025
WAS HAPPENING WAS INAPPROPRIATE.

01:54:26.092 --> 01:54:28.061
BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO OTHER

01:54:28.127 --> 01:54:30.263
STUDENTS ALWAYS REMAINED ON MY

01:54:30.330 --> 01:54:32.398
MIND AND MADE ME WONDER. WHEN I

01:54:32.465 --> 01:54:35.001
CAME ACROSS MATT'S WORK, WHEN HE

01:54:35.068 --> 01:54:36.269
BEGAN WRITING THESE STORIES, IT

01:54:36.336 --> 01:54:38.638
WAS ABOUT TWO YEARS BEFORE I GOT

01:54:38.705 --> 01:54:41.441
HERE, ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO, AND

01:54:41.507 --> 01:54:43.309
WE GOT CONNECTED. AND, YOU KNOW,

01:54:43.376 --> 01:54:45.044
HE FOUND OUT I WAS RUNNING FOR

01:54:45.111 --> 01:54:46.279
OFFICE AND HE ASKED ME IF I

01:54:46.346 --> 01:54:48.114
WOULD BE WILLING TO DO

01:54:48.181 --> 01:54:49.148
LEGISLATION IN THIS SPACE. AND I

01:54:49.215 --> 01:54:51.217
SAID, I DON'T KNOW IF I'LL WIN,

01:54:51.284 --> 01:54:52.252
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT WOULD

01:54:52.318 --> 01:54:53.519
CERTAINLY BE SOMETHING THAT

01:54:53.586 --> 01:54:55.054
WOULD BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME.

01:54:55.121 --> 01:54:58.124
AND SO IT IS SO, SO PERSONAL TO

01:54:58.191 --> 01:55:01.294
BE ABLE TO NOW RUN THIS BILL.

01:55:01.361 --> 01:55:02.629
BUT WHAT I REALLY WANT TO CENTER

01:55:02.695 --> 01:55:04.497
IN THAT IS THAT IT'S THE STORIES

01:55:04.564 --> 01:55:06.432
OF THE SURVIVORS THAT WERE JUST

01:55:06.499 --> 01:55:09.302
SO MOVING AND INSPIRING TO ME.

01:55:09.369 --> 01:55:10.570
AND SO MANY OF THEM HAVE

01:55:10.637 --> 01:55:12.705
ACTUALLY FLOWN UP HERE TO SHARE

01:55:12.772 --> 01:55:14.507
THEIR STORIES. UNFORTUNATELY,

01:55:14.574 --> 01:55:15.675
THEY COULD NOT MAKE IT TO

01:55:15.742 --> 01:55:17.610
TODAY'S HEARING, BUT I WANTED TO

01:55:17.677 --> 01:55:19.078
TAKE A MOMENT TO SHARE ONE OF

01:55:19.145 --> 01:55:20.280
THEIR STORIES, BECAUSE I THINK

01:55:20.346 --> 01:55:22.515
IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT YOU

01:55:22.582 --> 01:55:23.516
ACTUALLY HEAR DIRECTLY THEIR

01:55:23.583 --> 01:55:25.385
WORDS MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE'S

01:55:25.451 --> 01:55:29.522
TODAY. SO IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND,

01:55:29.589 --> 01:55:31.457
PLEASE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE

01:55:31.524 --> 01:55:33.660
COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS CINDY AND

01:55:33.726 --> 01:55:36.129
I AM HERE AS A SURVIVOR OF CHILD

01:55:36.195 --> 01:55:38.731
GROOMING AT ROSEMEAD HIGH SCHOOL

01:55:38.798 --> 01:55:41.434
TO EXPRESS MY STRONG SUPPORT FOR

01:55:41.501 --> 01:55:45.171
SB 848. I WAS 15. IT WAS MY

01:55:45.238 --> 01:55:47.006
FIRST REAL PAYING JOB AS THE

01:55:47.073 --> 01:55:49.776
PIANO ACCOMPANIST FOR THE SCHOOL

01:55:49.842 --> 01:55:52.745
CHOIRS. FROM DAY ONE, MY CHOIR

01:55:52.812 --> 01:55:54.247
TEACHER INTENTIONALLY TREATED ME

01:55:54.314 --> 01:55:55.982
AS AN ADULT INSTEAD OF A

01:55:56.049 --> 01:55:58.017
TEENAGER. IT STARTED WITH COFFEE

01:55:58.084 --> 01:56:00.286
RUNS BEFORE OUR PRIVATE

01:56:00.353 --> 01:56:02.422
REHEARSALS. GREETINGS LIKE HEY

01:56:02.488 --> 01:56:05.358
YOU, A FRIENDLY BOP ON THE

01:56:05.425 --> 01:56:06.326
FOREHEAD AND AN AFFECTIONATE

01:56:06.392 --> 01:56:07.960
SQUEEZE OF MY SHOULDERS QUICKLY

01:56:08.027 --> 01:56:10.697
BECAME PART OF OUR ROUTINE. WE

01:56:10.763 --> 01:56:12.565
BEGAN SPENDING MORE AND MORE

01:56:12.632 --> 01:56:14.834
TIME TOGETHER. HE TOLD ME, IF

01:56:14.901 --> 01:56:16.269
YOU DON'T SIGN UP FOR CHOIR

01:56:16.336 --> 01:56:18.004
CLASS NEXT YEAR INSTEAD OF

01:56:18.071 --> 01:56:19.072
CALCULUS, I'LL HAVE TO FIND

01:56:19.138 --> 01:56:21.407
ANOTHER ACCOMPANIST. I CAN'T RUN

01:56:21.474 --> 01:56:23.976
CHOIR CLASS WITHOUT YOU, I NEED

01:56:24.043 --> 01:56:26.979
YOU. THEN CAME THE FATHERLY

01:56:27.046 --> 01:56:28.748
ADVICE. IT'S TRASHY WHEN YOUR

01:56:28.815 --> 01:56:31.250
BRA STRAPS SHOW AND THE

01:56:31.317 --> 01:56:33.152
UNSOLICITED SUGGESTIONS ABOUT

01:56:33.219 --> 01:56:35.621
SEX. MARRIAGE IS LIKE BUYING AN

01:56:35.688 --> 01:56:37.724
EXPENSIVE CAR. WHY BRAG ABOUT

01:56:37.790 --> 01:56:40.259
DRIVING EXPENSIVE CARS AS A

01:56:40.326 --> 01:56:41.060
VALET DRIVER, WHEN YOU COULD

01:56:41.127 --> 01:56:43.196
SAVE UP MONEY TO OWN THE CAR?

01:56:43.262 --> 01:56:45.031
OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS OF

01:56:45.098 --> 01:56:47.133
MY MOST FORMATIVE TEEN YEARS, MY

01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:48.501
CHOIR TEACHER BECAME MY MOST

01:56:48.568 --> 01:56:51.471
TRUSTED CONFIDANTE AND MENTOR,

01:56:51.537 --> 01:56:52.872
CONSISTENTLY DISPLAYING

01:56:52.939 --> 01:56:54.040
PERFORMATIVE ACTS OF CARE

01:56:54.107 --> 01:56:55.975
TOWARDS ME BOTH IN PRIVATE AND

01:56:56.042 --> 01:56:58.378
IN FRONT OF OTHER STUDENTS. BY

01:56:58.444 --> 01:57:00.279
THE BY THE TIME HE INITIATED SEX

01:57:00.346 --> 01:57:02.615
WITH ME, I WAS PUTTY IN HIS

01:57:02.682 --> 01:57:04.317
HANDS, AND BY THE TIME I

01:57:04.384 --> 01:57:06.119
REALIZED I HAD BEEN GROOMED, I

01:57:06.185 --> 01:57:08.688
WAS COMPLETELY ISOLATED AND

01:57:08.755 --> 01:57:10.990
PSYCHOLOGICALLY DESTROYED.

01:57:11.057 --> 01:57:13.025
TRAGICALLY, THIS IS THE STORY OF

01:57:13.092 --> 01:57:14.861
TOO MANY CHILDREN WHO SEEK

01:57:14.927 --> 01:57:16.629
SOLACE AND SAFETY AT SCHOOL,

01:57:16.696 --> 01:57:18.698
ONLY TO END UP IN THE WRONG

01:57:18.765 --> 01:57:21.667
PREDATORY HANDS. A LAW LIKE SB

01:57:21.734 --> 01:57:23.069
848 WOULD HAVE ADEQUATELY

01:57:23.136 --> 01:57:24.871
EDUCATED ME ABOUT GROOMING

01:57:24.937 --> 01:57:26.239
BEHAVIORS. I WOULD HAVE KNOWN

01:57:26.305 --> 01:57:28.107
THAT THESE INTERACTIONS WERE

01:57:28.174 --> 01:57:30.343
INAPPROPRIATE AND REPORTED THEM.

01:57:30.410 --> 01:57:31.978
MY ABUSER WOULD BE IN JAIL AND

01:57:32.044 --> 01:57:33.780
NEVER BE ABLE TO WORK AROUND

01:57:33.846 --> 01:57:36.149
CHILDREN AGAIN. INSTEAD, HE HAS

01:57:36.215 --> 01:57:38.351
BEEN ABLE TO AVOID THESE

01:57:38.418 --> 01:57:40.420
CONSEQUENCES, RESIGNING TWICE

01:57:40.486 --> 01:57:43.022
FROM TWO DIFFERENT SCHOOLS 20

01:57:43.089 --> 01:57:45.792
YEARS APART DUE TO CALIFORNIA'S

01:57:45.858 --> 01:57:47.160
QUOTE UNQUOTE PASS THE TRASH

01:57:47.226 --> 01:57:49.429
LAWS. HE IS FREE TO APPLY TO

01:57:49.495 --> 01:57:51.464
OTHER TEACHING JOBS WITHOUT

01:57:51.531 --> 01:57:54.767
DISCLOSING WHAT HE DID TO ME. SB

01:57:54.834 --> 01:57:57.036
848 WOULD PREVENT ALL OF THIS.

01:57:57.103 --> 01:57:58.871
IN ADDITION TO MANDATING

01:57:58.938 --> 01:58:00.206
COMPREHENSIVE TRAINING,

01:58:00.273 --> 01:58:01.641
REQUIRING ABUSE AWARENESS

01:58:01.707 --> 01:58:03.810
EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS, AND

01:58:03.876 --> 01:58:05.678
ENSURING REPORTING OF EGREGIOUS

01:58:05.745 --> 01:58:07.346
MISCONDUCT, IT WOULD CRIMINALIZE

01:58:07.413 --> 01:58:09.248
GROOMING, REQUIRED THOROUGH

01:58:09.315 --> 01:58:11.017
HISTORY CHECKS, AND CREATE AN

01:58:11.083 --> 01:58:12.819
ELECTRONIC DATABASE TO TRACK

01:58:12.885 --> 01:58:15.321
SCHOOL EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT. MY

01:58:15.388 --> 01:58:16.656
EXPERIENCE COULD HAVE BEEN VERY

01:58:16.722 --> 01:58:19.659
DIFFERENT IF SB 848 EXISTED,

01:58:19.725 --> 01:58:21.227
MAYBE MY ABUSER WOULD HAVE NEVER

01:58:21.294 --> 01:58:22.862
EVEN TRIED IN THE FIRST PLACE.

01:58:22.929 --> 01:58:24.197
FOR THE SAFETY OF ALL CHILDREN,

01:58:24.263 --> 01:58:26.632
I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT

01:58:26.699 --> 01:58:31.537
FOR SB 848. THANK YOU. THANK

01:58:31.604 --> 01:58:34.707

CALL THE ROLL. ITEM 12 SB 848.

THE MOTION IS DUE PASS AS

01:58:39.879 --> 01:58:41.180
AMENDED TO PUBLIC SAFETY

01:58:41.247 --> 01:58:43.049

OUT. OKAY. NEXT IN SIGNING

01:59:07.006 --> 01:59:08.608
ORDER, WE HAVE SENATOR PADILLA,

01:59:08.674 --> 01:59:10.409
FILE ITEM NUMBER TEN, SENATE

01:59:10.476 --> 01:59:18.751
BILL 650 806 38. AND WHILE

01:59:18.818 --> 01:59:20.152
YOU'RE AT IT, SENATOR PADILLA, I

01:59:20.219 --> 01:59:21.654
THINK YOU ARE PRESENTING ON

01:59:21.721 --> 01:59:24.090
BEHALF OF SENATOR REYES, TWO

01:59:24.156 --> 01:59:29.095
MORE MEASURES WHICH WILL CALL UP

01:59:29.161 --> 01:59:37.904
FOLLOWING THIS BILL. SO I

01:59:37.970 --> 01:59:39.005
BELIEVE, SENATOR, YOU'RE

01:59:39.071 --> 01:59:41.641
STARTING WITH YOUR OWN BILL,

01:59:41.707 --> 01:59:46.012
FILE ITEM NUMBER TEN. DO THAT

01:59:46.078 --> 01:59:48.014
MANUALLY HERE. A LOT OF FREEDOM

01:59:48.080 --> 01:59:50.850
IN THE ASSEMBLY, MR. CHAIRMAN.

01:59:50.917 --> 01:59:52.885
WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE MONEY THAT

01:59:52.952 --> 01:59:54.086
YOU HAVE ON THE SENATE SIDE. I

01:59:54.153 --> 01:59:56.822
WISH THAT WERE TRUE. MR.

01:59:56.889 --> 01:59:58.257
CHAIRMAN. AND MEMBERS, I'D LIKE

01:59:58.324 --> 02:00:00.059
TO START OFF, I'M PLEASED TO

02:00:00.126 --> 02:00:02.595
PRESENT SB 638. I'D LIKE TO

02:00:02.662 --> 02:00:04.163
START OFF BY ACCEPTING THE

02:00:04.230 --> 02:00:04.697
COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND

02:00:04.764 --> 02:00:06.098
THANKING YOUR STAFF FOR THEIR

02:00:06.165 --> 02:00:07.333
INCREDIBLE WORK. WITH HOURS ON

02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:09.135
THIS THIS PAST YEAR, AS MANY OF

02:00:09.201 --> 02:00:10.403
YOU KNOW, I CO-CHAIRED THE

02:00:10.469 --> 02:00:11.971
AFFORDABILITY WORKING GROUP WITH

02:00:12.038 --> 02:00:12.572
MY SENATE COLLEAGUES, AND IN

02:00:12.638 --> 02:00:14.473
THAT WORK, WE PLACED PARTICULAR

02:00:14.540 --> 02:00:15.641
EMPHASIS ON EXPANDING

02:00:15.708 --> 02:00:17.109
OPPORTUNITIES AND PATHWAYS TO

02:00:17.176 --> 02:00:19.545
THE CALIFORNIA DREAM. SB 638 IS

02:00:19.612 --> 02:00:21.347
A RESULT OF OUR EFFORTS, AND IT

02:00:21.414 --> 02:00:23.082
WILL HELP REBUILD THE MIDDLE

02:00:23.149 --> 02:00:24.550
CLASS BY INCREASING ACCESS TO

02:00:24.617 --> 02:00:25.618
OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL

02:00:25.685 --> 02:00:27.186
CALIFORNIANS, PARTICULARLY THOSE

02:00:27.253 --> 02:00:30.089
WHO PURSUE DEVELOPMENT OF SKILLS

02:00:30.156 --> 02:00:31.357
AND TALENTS OUTSIDE OF

02:00:31.424 --> 02:00:32.825
TRADITIONAL EDUCATIONAL

02:00:32.892 --> 02:00:35.328
PATHWAYS. FUNDAMENTALLY, THE

02:00:35.394 --> 02:00:36.862
ABILITY TO HAVE MARKETABLE

02:00:36.929 --> 02:00:38.631
SKILLS IS YOUR ABILITY TO

02:00:38.698 --> 02:00:40.399
PARTICIPATE IN OUR ECONOMY. YOUR

02:00:40.466 --> 02:00:41.434
ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR

02:00:41.500 --> 02:00:42.969
ECONOMY IS DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO

02:00:43.035 --> 02:00:44.236
THE QUESTIONS OF AFFORDABILITY

02:00:44.303 --> 02:00:45.271
THAT WE'RE GRAPPLING WITH HERE

02:00:45.338 --> 02:00:47.106
IN THE LEGISLATURE. AS MANY OF

02:00:47.173 --> 02:00:48.674
YOU KNOW, RECENTLY, A PIKE

02:00:48.741 --> 02:00:50.943
SURVEY FOUND THAT 70% OF

02:00:51.010 --> 02:00:51.544
CALIFORNIANS THINK THEIR

02:00:51.611 --> 02:00:53.379
CHILDREN, WHEN THEY GROW UP IN

02:00:53.446 --> 02:00:55.381
CALIFORNIA, WILL BE WORSE OFF

02:00:55.448 --> 02:00:57.316
FINANCIALLY THAN THEIR PARENTS.

02:00:57.383 --> 02:00:59.051
MOREOVER, ABOUT 60% OF

02:00:59.118 --> 02:00:59.719
CALIFORNIANS THINK THAT

02:00:59.785 --> 02:01:01.621
ACHIEVING THE AMERICAN DREAM IS

02:01:01.687 --> 02:01:03.689
HARDER IN CALIFORNIA THAN

02:01:03.756 --> 02:01:05.992
ANYWHERE ELSE. PUT SIMPLY,

02:01:06.058 --> 02:01:07.393
OPPORTUNITIES ARE SLIPPING AWAY

02:01:07.460 --> 02:01:08.361
FOR MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS AND

02:01:08.427 --> 02:01:11.130
THEIR FAMILY. IT'S PRIMARILY FOR

02:01:11.197 --> 02:01:12.398
THREE REASONS. FIRST,

02:01:12.465 --> 02:01:13.633
CALIFORNIA'S EDUCATION AND

02:01:13.699 --> 02:01:14.667
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM IS

02:01:14.734 --> 02:01:16.769
NOT WORKING AS WELL. FOR THOSE

02:01:16.836 --> 02:01:18.604
WHO ARE ON WHAT WE WOULD PRIOR

02:01:18.671 --> 02:01:19.972
CONSIDER NONTRADITIONAL PATHS.

02:01:20.039 --> 02:01:21.440
AS FOR THOSE SEEKING

02:01:21.507 --> 02:01:22.975
BACCALAUREATE OR POST-GRADUATE

02:01:23.042 --> 02:01:25.344
STUDIES, OUR INCOME GAP IS

02:01:25.411 --> 02:01:27.346
CONTINUING TO GROW RAPIDLY, AND

02:01:27.413 --> 02:01:28.981
WE ARE NOT CHURNING OUT THE

02:01:29.048 --> 02:01:30.783
WORKFORCE THAT IS SKILLED AND

02:01:30.850 --> 02:01:33.686
READY TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF OUR

02:01:33.753 --> 02:01:34.987
ECONOMY. OUR EDUCATION AND

02:01:35.054 --> 02:01:36.522
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM IS

02:01:36.589 --> 02:01:38.290
DISJOINTED FOR NOT FOR LACK OF

02:01:38.357 --> 02:01:40.126
MANY WONDERFUL PROGRAMS AND

02:01:40.192 --> 02:01:41.293
EFFORTS, BUT THEY'RE SPREAD

02:01:41.360 --> 02:01:43.362
THROUGH MULTIPLE AGENCIES AND

02:01:43.429 --> 02:01:45.331
OFTEN ARE NOT COORDINATING OR

02:01:45.398 --> 02:01:46.499
COMMUNICATING WITH ONE ANOTHER.

02:01:46.565 --> 02:01:50.102
IN CALIFORNIA, WE SPENT $7.3

02:01:50.169 --> 02:01:52.104
BILLION ON A BROAD RANGE OF

02:01:52.171 --> 02:01:53.205
EFFORTS, BUT FUNDING IS SPREAD

02:01:53.272 --> 02:01:54.173
ACROSS DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT

02:01:54.240 --> 02:01:56.042
OFTEN REQUIRE DIFFERENT PLANS,

02:01:56.108 --> 02:01:57.777
APPLICATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS,

02:01:57.843 --> 02:01:59.378
MAKING IT OFTEN DIFFICULT FOR

02:01:59.445 --> 02:02:00.680
COMMUNITIES, ESPECIALLY

02:02:00.746 --> 02:02:02.114
UNDER-INVESTED IN RURAL ONES.

02:02:02.181 --> 02:02:05.084
FOR EXAMPLE, TO ACCESS FUNDING.

02:02:05.151 --> 02:02:06.585
CALIFORNIA IS RAPIDLY AND HAS

02:02:06.652 --> 02:02:08.554
BEEN FOR SOME TIME BECOMING A

02:02:08.621 --> 02:02:11.957
TALE OF TWO ECONOMIES THAT ONE

02:02:12.024 --> 02:02:14.326
FOR WORKING POOR OR RURAL POOR,

02:02:14.393 --> 02:02:15.795
OTHERS IN COASTAL, URBAN AND

02:02:15.861 --> 02:02:17.697
WEALTHIER COMMUNITIES. THIS IS

02:02:17.763 --> 02:02:19.799
NOT ECONOMICALLY SUSTAINABLE. IT

02:02:19.865 --> 02:02:22.268
IS NOT SOCIALLY JUST. IT IS A

02:02:22.334 --> 02:02:23.636
VIOLATION OF OUR SOCIAL

02:02:23.703 --> 02:02:25.638
CONTRACTS, A GROWING PERCENTAGE

02:02:25.705 --> 02:02:27.406

STRANDED. RURAL AND INLAND

02:02:32.478 --> 02:02:33.546
COMMUNITIES TEND TO HAVE HIGHER

02:02:33.612 --> 02:02:34.714
UNEMPLOYMENT RATES, LOWER LEVELS

02:02:34.780 --> 02:02:36.982

02:02:37.049 --> 02:02:38.417
FAMILIES JUST SIMPLY STRUGGLING

02:02:38.484 --> 02:02:39.985
WITH MULTIPLE JOBS, OFTEN TO PUT

02:02:44.957 --> 02:02:46.325
HIGH SCHOOLERS ARE TAKING

02:02:46.392 --> 02:02:48.060
COLLEGE CLASSES, BUT NO SURPRISE

02:02:48.127 --> 02:02:49.995
WISH STUDENTS BENEFIT. MOST

02:02:50.062 --> 02:02:51.764
DISCUSSED THESE DISPARITIES.

02:02:51.831 --> 02:02:53.199
THIS DATA SHOWS THAT SOME OF

02:02:53.265 --> 02:02:54.100
CALIFORNIA'S RURAL STUDENTS, AS

02:02:54.166 --> 02:02:55.835
WELL AS PARTICULARLY, FOR

02:02:55.901 --> 02:02:57.603
EXAMPLE, MALES STUDENTS OF

NOT COMPLETE COURSES AT THE SAME

02:03:01.707 --> 02:03:04.009
RATE AS OTHER STUDENTS. THIS

02:03:04.076 --> 02:03:06.212
BILL CREATES A COORDINATING BODY

02:03:06.278 --> 02:03:08.047
MIDDLE CLASS PIPELINE PROJECT

02:03:08.114 --> 02:03:09.849
THAT WILL STREAMLINE, SEEK TO

STREAMLINE, IDENTIFY, AND

02:03:11.484 --> 02:03:13.352
IMPROVE INTERAGENCY PROGRAMING

02:03:13.419 --> 02:03:15.254

02:03:15.321 --> 02:03:17.056
DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS ADOPT

02:03:17.123 --> 02:03:18.190
REGULATIONS TO BETTER ADMINISTER

02:03:18.257 --> 02:03:19.892
PROGRAMS RELATED TO CAREER TECH

02:03:19.959 --> 02:03:22.128
EDUCATION. CAREER PATHWAYS TO

02:03:22.194 --> 02:03:23.262
ADDRESS REGIONAL DISPARITIES. IN

02:03:23.329 --> 02:03:25.297
THE SHORT TERM, THE BILL WILL

02:03:25.364 --> 02:03:26.766
INJECT RESOURCES. FUNDING FOR

02:03:26.832 --> 02:03:28.501
THIS WAS STRIPPED OUT OF THE

02:03:28.567 --> 02:03:29.535
BUDGET SUBMITTAL. WE WERE PROUD

02:03:29.602 --> 02:03:32.505
TO RESTORE IT IN THE SENATE THAT

02:03:32.571 --> 02:03:33.739
ULTIMATELY MADE ITS WAY INTO THE

02:03:33.806 --> 02:03:36.509
BUDGET AGREEMENT. LOW INCOME

02:03:36.575 --> 02:03:38.010
REGIONS IN OUR STATE, LOCAL

02:03:38.077 --> 02:03:39.211
EDUCATION AGENCIES NEED TO HAVE

02:03:39.278 --> 02:03:40.346
THE ABILITY TO CREATE HIGHER

02:03:40.412 --> 02:03:42.248
TECH EDUCATION AND PATHWAYS, AND

02:03:42.314 --> 02:03:44.116
FOR THAT, THEY NEED RESOURCES.

02:03:44.183 --> 02:03:45.985
WE CANNOT AFFORD TO CONTINUE TO

02:03:46.051 --> 02:03:47.586
PUSH FORWARD WHILE ONLY BRINGING

02:03:47.653 --> 02:03:49.388
CERTAIN COMMUNITIES ALONG WITH

02:03:49.455 --> 02:03:51.757
US. THE PROSPERITY OF OUR STATE

02:03:51.824 --> 02:03:53.492
NEEDS TO BE AVAILABLE FOR

02:03:53.559 --> 02:03:55.127
EVERYONE. I'M PLEASED TODAY TO

02:03:55.194 --> 02:03:56.996
BE JOINED BY AJ JOHNSON WITH CAL

02:03:57.062 --> 02:03:59.532
COMPETES AND ZIMA CREASON WITH

02:03:59.598 --> 02:04:03.602
THE EDGE COALITION. GOOD

02:04:03.669 --> 02:04:05.237
AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M

02:04:05.304 --> 02:04:06.806
AJ JOHNSON WITH CALIFORNIA

02:04:06.872 --> 02:04:08.140
COMPETES HIGHER EDUCATION FOR A

02:04:08.207 --> 02:04:10.643
STRONG ECONOMY. BEFORE ENTERING

02:04:10.709 --> 02:04:12.778
POLICY I TAUGHT MIDDLE SCHOOL IN

02:04:12.845 --> 02:04:15.714
OAKLAND. EVERY DAY I SAW HOW

02:04:15.781 --> 02:04:17.550
DISCONNECTED SYSTEMS HURT

02:04:17.616 --> 02:04:19.318
STUDENTS AND FAMILIES, AND MY

02:04:19.385 --> 02:04:21.086
STUDENTS FACED COLLEGE

02:04:21.153 --> 02:04:22.054
REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE

02:04:22.121 --> 02:04:23.255
INCONSISTENT AND ALWAYS

02:04:23.322 --> 02:04:24.423
SHIFTING. THE COST OF ATTENDING

02:04:24.490 --> 02:04:27.493
WAS DAUNTING. THEY OFTEN CAME TO

02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:28.994
SCHOOL HUNGRY OR EXHAUSTED FROM

02:04:29.061 --> 02:04:30.763
BOUNCING BETWEEN TEMPORARY

02:04:33.399 --> 02:04:34.834
SERVED AS A SOCIAL WORKER,

COUNSELOR ON TOP OF TEACHING

02:04:38.604 --> 02:04:39.872
BECAUSE THERE WAS NO SYSTEM

02:04:39.939 --> 02:04:42.141
CONNECTING THE DOTS FOR OUR

02:04:42.208 --> 02:04:44.777
STUDENTS. SB 638 IS ABOUT

02:04:44.844 --> 02:04:45.911
COORDINATING OUR VARIOUS

02:04:45.978 --> 02:04:47.313
GOVERNMENT ENTITIES SO THAT

02:04:47.379 --> 02:04:48.881
CALIFORNIANS CAN ACCESS WHAT

02:04:48.948 --> 02:04:50.583
THEY NEED TO LEARN AND THRIVE.

02:04:50.649 --> 02:04:52.117
OUR STATE FACES A PROJECTED

02:04:52.184 --> 02:04:53.986
SHORTFALL OF 2 MILLION COLLEGE

02:04:54.053 --> 02:04:56.021
EDUCATED WORKERS BY 2030.

02:04:56.088 --> 02:04:57.556
MEETING THAT NEED REQUIRES

02:04:57.623 --> 02:04:59.625
BETTER ALIGNMENT ACROSS SYSTEMS,

02:04:59.692 --> 02:05:01.427
AND STARTING WITH THIS STATEWIDE

02:05:01.493 --> 02:05:02.962
COORDINATING ENTITY LIKE THE ONE

02:05:03.028 --> 02:05:04.630
THIS BILL WOULD ESTABLISH,

02:05:04.697 --> 02:05:06.065
CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE

02:05:06.131 --> 02:05:07.299
WITHOUT A HIGHER EDUCATION

02:05:07.366 --> 02:05:09.068
COORDINATING ENTITY, LEAVING

02:05:09.134 --> 02:05:10.102
STUDENTS AND FAMILIES ON THEIR

02:05:10.169 --> 02:05:12.271
OWN TO NAVIGATE COMPLEX AND

02:05:12.338 --> 02:05:14.273
CONFLICTING SYSTEMS WITH HIGH

02:05:14.340 --> 02:05:16.976

02:05:17.042 --> 02:05:18.377
FILLS THE GAPS AND MORE,

02:05:18.444 --> 02:05:19.712
CONNECTING NOT JUST HIGHER ED,

02:05:19.778 --> 02:05:21.914
BUT ALSO TC 12 WORKFORCE AND

02:05:21.981 --> 02:05:23.749
SAFETY NET PROGRAMS THAT

02:05:23.816 --> 02:05:25.651
CALIFORNIANS DEPEND ON.

02:05:25.718 --> 02:05:26.952
COORDINATION WILL HELP ADDRESS

02:05:27.019 --> 02:05:28.687
LABOR MARKET SHORTAGES, LIKE IN

02:05:28.754 --> 02:05:30.055
TEACHING. I SAW THE CHALLENGES

02:05:30.122 --> 02:05:31.991
OF RECRUITING AND RETAINING

02:05:32.057 --> 02:05:33.425
TEACHERS FROM THE COMMUNITIES MY

02:05:33.492 --> 02:05:35.194
SCHOOL SERVED. A COORDINATING

02:05:35.261 --> 02:05:36.896
ENTITY COULD PROVIDE ACTIONABLE

02:05:36.962 --> 02:05:38.831
LABOR MARKET INFORMATION AND USE

02:05:38.898 --> 02:05:40.799
IT TO ELEVATE CAREER PATHWAYS

02:05:40.866 --> 02:05:42.434
AND DESIGN CROSS-SECTOR REFORMS

02:05:42.501 --> 02:05:43.802
THAT GIVE EVERY STUDENT ACCESS

02:05:43.869 --> 02:05:46.305
TO A WELL-SUPPORTED TEACHER. AND

02:05:46.372 --> 02:05:48.240
LET'S NOT FORGET THE ROLE OF

02:05:48.307 --> 02:05:50.142
CAREGIVERS. MOST OF THE 6.8

02:05:50.209 --> 02:05:51.844
MILLION CALIFORNIANS WITH A HIGH

02:05:51.911 --> 02:05:52.878
SCHOOL DIPLOMA BUT NO COLLEGE

02:05:52.945 --> 02:05:55.014
DEGREE HAVE DEPENDENT CHILDREN.

02:05:55.080 --> 02:05:56.782
BETTER COORDINATION COULD EXPAND

02:05:56.849 --> 02:05:58.284
CREDIT FOR PRIOR LEARNING AND

02:05:58.350 --> 02:05:59.418
OTHER POLICIES THAT MAKE IT

02:05:59.485 --> 02:06:01.553
EASIER FOR LEARNERS TO

02:06:01.620 --> 02:06:02.988
TRANSITION BETWEEN SYSTEMS AND

HELPING PARENTS GRADUATE FASTER,

02:06:05.224 --> 02:06:07.293

02:06:07.359 --> 02:06:08.060
MULTIGENERATIONAL SUCCESS FOR

02:06:08.127 --> 02:06:09.795
THEIR CHILDREN. IF WE WANT

02:06:09.862 --> 02:06:11.530
STUDENTS TO COME TO SCHOOL READY

02:06:11.597 --> 02:06:13.365
TO LEARN. IF WE WANT MORE

02:06:13.432 --> 02:06:14.433
TEACHERS TO STAY IN THE

02:06:14.500 --> 02:06:16.068
PROFESSION, AND IF WE WANT OUR

02:06:16.135 --> 02:06:17.770
STATE TO HAVE THE WORKFORCE IT

02:06:17.836 --> 02:06:18.904
NEEDS, WE NEED CLEAR,

02:06:18.971 --> 02:06:20.539
COORDINATED AND SUPPORTED

02:06:20.606 --> 02:06:22.374
PATHWAYS FROM EDUCATION TO

EMPLOYMENT AND SOMETIMES BACK

02:06:23.776 --> 02:06:26.011
AGAIN. AN SB 638 HELPS MAKE THAT

02:06:26.078 --> 02:06:30.482
POSSIBLE. THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

02:06:30.549 --> 02:06:32.284
GOOD AFTERNOON, CHAIR MEMBERS

02:06:32.351 --> 02:06:34.653
I'M KRISTEN, I'M THE EXECUTIVE

PRIVILEGE OF SERVING ON THE SAN

JUAN UNIFIED BOARD OF EDUCATION.

02:06:39.558 --> 02:06:41.393
BUT TODAY I'M HERE WITH MY EDGE

02:06:41.460 --> 02:06:43.028
HAT. ON EDGE IS A NONPROFIT,

02:06:43.095 --> 02:06:44.330
NONPARTISAN STATE POLICY

02:06:44.396 --> 02:06:45.664

IN HIGH ROAD, HIGH OPPORTUNITY

02:06:49.034 --> 02:06:50.869

ECONOMIC MOBILITY FOR ALL

02:06:52.738 --> 02:06:54.506
CALIFORNIANS, ALL WHILE ALSO

02:06:54.573 --> 02:06:56.008
HELPING EMPLOYERS ACCESS THE

02:06:56.075 --> 02:06:57.009
SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE

02:06:57.076 --> 02:06:58.877
THAT THEY NEED. RIGHT NOW, TOO

02:06:58.944 --> 02:07:00.179
MANY GOOD JOBS ARE GOING

02:07:00.245 --> 02:07:01.347
UNFILLED, AND TOO MUCH TALENT IN

02:07:01.413 --> 02:07:02.381
CALIFORNIA IS LIVING BELOW A

02:07:02.448 --> 02:07:04.249
LIVING WAGE OR IN POVERTY, AND

02:07:04.316 --> 02:07:05.417
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. AT

02:07:05.484 --> 02:07:07.286
EDGE. WE WORK EVERY DAY TO CLOSE

02:07:07.353 --> 02:07:09.221
THAT GAP. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT SB

02:07:09.288 --> 02:07:10.856
638 BECAUSE IT ADDRESSES LONG

02:07:10.923 --> 02:07:12.791
STANDING STRUCTURAL CHALLENGES

02:07:12.858 --> 02:07:14.560
WE'VE PRIORITIZED FOR YEARS. AT

02:07:14.626 --> 02:07:17.162
ITS CORE, THIS BILL IS ABOUT

02:07:17.229 --> 02:07:17.763
COALITION BUILDING, SOMETHING

02:07:17.830 --> 02:07:19.631
THAT'S CENTRAL TO WHO WE ARE AT

02:07:19.698 --> 02:07:22.101
EDGE COALITION IS IN OUR NAME.

02:07:22.167 --> 02:07:23.369
FOR DECADES, EDGE HAS BROUGHT

02:07:23.435 --> 02:07:24.403
TOGETHER LEADERS FROM BUSINESS,

02:07:24.470 --> 02:07:26.105
LABOR, EDUCATION, WORKFORCE

02:07:26.171 --> 02:07:27.639
DEVELOPMENT AND SOCIAL JUSTICE

02:07:27.706 --> 02:07:29.808
TO ADVANCE OUR SHARED GOALS. WE

02:07:29.875 --> 02:07:31.610
BRING THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO THE

02:07:31.677 --> 02:07:33.379
TABLE TO PLAN, COLLABORATE AND

02:07:33.445 --> 02:07:35.881
COORDINATE. SB 368 AIMS TO DO

02:07:35.948 --> 02:07:37.683
THE EXACT SAME THING. WE KNOW

02:07:37.750 --> 02:07:39.351
THAT THIS COLLABORATIVE MODEL

02:07:39.418 --> 02:07:41.620
WORKS. CALIFORNIA INVEST

02:07:41.687 --> 02:07:43.655
BILLIONS ANNUALLY ACROSS SILOED

02:07:43.722 --> 02:07:45.224
EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE

02:07:45.290 --> 02:07:46.191
PROGRAMS, EACH WITH ITS OWN SET

02:07:46.258 --> 02:07:48.794
OF RULES, FUNDING STREAMS, AND

02:07:48.861 --> 02:07:50.963
GOALS. EVEN AS PROFESSIONALS, IT

02:07:51.030 --> 02:07:52.498
ABSOLUTELY MAKES OUR HEADS SPIN

02:07:52.564 --> 02:07:53.832
WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO NAVIGATE

02:07:53.899 --> 02:07:55.300
THESE SYSTEMS. IT CAN BE

02:07:55.367 --> 02:07:57.036
ABSOLUTELY OVERWHELMING. NOW

02:07:57.102 --> 02:07:58.871
IMAGINE HOW DIFFICULT IT IS FOR

02:07:58.937 --> 02:08:00.439
STUDENTS AND FAMILIES AND

02:08:00.506 --> 02:08:01.740
WORKERS TRYING TO ACCESS

02:08:01.807 --> 02:08:03.475
OPPORTUNITY. THIS COORDINATING

02:08:03.542 --> 02:08:06.045
BODY WOULD HELP IDENTIFY GAPS

02:08:06.111 --> 02:08:07.813
AND DISPARITIES ACROSS SYSTEMS,

02:08:07.880 --> 02:08:09.581
ENSURING THAT OPPORTUNITY YOUTH

02:08:09.648 --> 02:08:11.683
AND ADULT LEARNERS DON'T FACE

02:08:11.750 --> 02:08:13.552
UNNECESSARY BARRIERS IN THEIR

02:08:13.619 --> 02:08:15.654
PURSUIT OF ECONOMIC SECURITY.

02:08:15.721 --> 02:08:16.789
EQUALLY IMPORTANT, IT WOULD

02:08:16.855 --> 02:08:18.123
BRING TOGETHER KEY PARTNERS TO

02:08:18.190 --> 02:08:20.592
BUILD A UNIFIED, RESPONSIVE

02:08:20.659 --> 02:08:22.361
SYSTEM THAT WORKS FOR ALL

02:08:22.428 --> 02:08:23.595
CALIFORNIANS. THIS BILL'S

02:08:23.662 --> 02:08:24.930
ALIGNMENT WITH THE CRADLE TO

02:08:24.997 --> 02:08:26.765
CAREER DATA SYSTEM IS ALSO

02:08:26.832 --> 02:08:28.434
CRITICAL. DATA DRIVEN INSIGHTS

02:08:28.500 --> 02:08:30.035
WILL HELP US BETTER TARGET

02:08:30.102 --> 02:08:31.236
INVESTMENTS AND EVALUATE

02:08:31.303 --> 02:08:33.772
PROGRESS TO ENSURE MEASURABLE

02:09:34.600 --> 02:09:38.170
SENATOR. I'VE BEEN WORKING ON

02:09:38.237 --> 02:09:40.639
THIS ISSUE OF CAREER TECHNICAL

02:09:40.706 --> 02:09:43.408
EDUCATION. MY 11 YEARS HERE IN

02:09:43.475 --> 02:09:46.712
THE LEGISLATURE. AND SO IT'S

02:09:46.778 --> 02:09:49.314
EXCITING TO SEE THAT YOU NOT

02:09:49.381 --> 02:09:51.383
ONLY I'VE SEEN PROPOSALS TO

02:09:51.450 --> 02:09:53.085
CREATE THESE COORDINATING

02:09:53.152 --> 02:09:54.353
ENTITIES, BUT YOU GOT THE

02:09:54.419 --> 02:09:56.121
FUNDING FOR IT, WHICH IS ALL THE

02:09:56.188 --> 02:10:02.294
DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD. AND I,

02:10:02.361 --> 02:10:03.762
YOU KNOW, APPRECIATE YOU

02:10:03.829 --> 02:10:04.696
ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS, YOU

02:10:04.763 --> 02:10:06.865
KNOW, BECAUSE I KNOW ONE OF THE

02:10:06.932 --> 02:10:08.100
CONCERNS THAT WAS RAISED IN OUR

02:10:08.167 --> 02:10:09.101
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE MASTER

02:10:09.168 --> 02:10:11.336
PLAN, THE GOVERNOR'S MASTER PLAN

02:10:11.403 --> 02:10:15.240
FOR CAREER EDUCATION WAS THE

02:10:15.307 --> 02:10:19.077
NUMEROUS FUNDING. STREAMS THAT

02:10:19.144 --> 02:10:22.314
THAT WERE OFTEN DUPLICATIVE OR,

02:10:22.381 --> 02:10:25.717
YOU KNOW, CONFUSING TO A LOT OF

02:10:25.784 --> 02:10:26.652
THE CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION

02:10:26.718 --> 02:10:31.390
PROVIDERS. AND SO BUT HAVING THE

02:10:31.456 --> 02:10:33.992
CTE AND CAREER PATHWAYS GRANT

02:10:34.059 --> 02:10:40.899
PROGRAM. RENAMED AND WITH WITH A

02:10:40.966 --> 02:10:43.502
NEW PURPOSE AND MISSION, I THINK

02:10:43.569 --> 02:10:45.571
IS DEFINITELY A STEP IN THE

02:10:45.637 --> 02:10:46.605
RIGHT DIRECTION. I WOULD BE

02:10:46.672 --> 02:10:48.106
HONORED IF YOU WOULD ADD ME AS A

02:10:48.173 --> 02:10:50.909
COAUTHOR TO YOUR BILL AND GIVE

02:10:50.976 --> 02:10:53.011
YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLOSE.

02:10:53.078 --> 02:10:54.179
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR.

02:10:54.246 --> 02:10:56.114
CHAIRMAN, AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR

02:10:56.181 --> 02:10:56.982
LEADERSHIP FOR SO MANY YEARS AND

02:10:57.049 --> 02:10:58.050
WORKING VERY COLLABORATIVELY

02:10:58.116 --> 02:11:00.018
WITH OUR OFFICE. AND IT IS, I

02:11:00.085 --> 02:11:01.253
THINK, SOMETHING WE AGREE UPON

02:11:01.320 --> 02:11:02.487
THAT'S IMPORTANT IS TO BUILD ON

02:11:02.554 --> 02:11:04.990
SOME OF THE PRIOR CONCEPTS THIS

02:11:05.057 --> 02:11:06.024
LEGISLATURE HAS PUT FORWARD ON

02:11:06.091 --> 02:11:07.025
COORDINATING ENTITIES, AS YOU

02:11:07.092 --> 02:11:08.560
WELL KNOW AND YOUR MEMBERS KNOW,

02:11:08.627 --> 02:11:10.495
THIS IS NOT A NEW CONCEPT, BUT

02:11:10.562 --> 02:11:11.263
WHAT'S DISTINCT IN THIS BILL,

02:11:11.330 --> 02:11:13.765
WHAT IT SEEKS TO ULTIMATELY

02:11:13.832 --> 02:11:14.266
ACCOMPLISH, IS TO BETTER

02:11:14.333 --> 02:11:14.900
OPERATIONALIZE THAT INTEGRATED

02:11:14.967 --> 02:11:16.368
ENTITY, WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT

02:11:16.435 --> 02:11:18.270
PRIOR ITERATIONS DID NOT

02:11:18.337 --> 02:11:20.005
ACHIEVE. AND WE BELIEVE AND I

02:11:20.072 --> 02:11:23.308
BELIEVE THAT THAT IS CRITICAL TO

02:11:23.375 --> 02:11:25.777
ACHIEVING SOME OF THE ABILITY TO

02:11:25.844 --> 02:11:27.980
CREATE ADDITIONAL ROOM FOR

02:11:28.046 --> 02:11:30.182
ADDITIONAL PARTICIPANTS TO

02:11:30.249 --> 02:11:32.851
IDENTIFY OVERLAPS AND DUPLICITY,

02:11:32.918 --> 02:11:34.653
TO REALLY MAXIMIZE

02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:36.488
PARTICIPATION, AND TO SORT OF

02:11:36.555 --> 02:11:37.623
MODERNIZE THE WHOLE INTEGRATED

02:11:37.689 --> 02:11:40.259
SYSTEM AND MAYBE TAKE A MORE

02:11:40.325 --> 02:11:41.293
SYSTEMIC AND STRATEGIC APPROACH,

02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:42.294
LOOKING AT ALL THE LEADING

02:11:42.361 --> 02:11:43.161
INDUSTRIES THAT OUR STATE WILL

02:11:43.228 --> 02:11:45.597
NEED IN THE FUTURE. SO I THINK

02:11:45.664 --> 02:11:46.665
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND VERY

02:11:46.732 --> 02:11:49.134
MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP,

02:11:49.201 --> 02:11:51.169

SIMPLIFY THE CIVIC ENGAGEMENT

EXCELLENT TOOL TO MAKE IT

LEADER WITHIN THE CONGREGATION

02:14:04.603 --> 02:14:06.338
IMPORTANTLY, I AM HERE TO VOICE

REGISTRATION ACT. SO, AS WE ALL

02:14:11.777 --> 02:14:13.178
KNOW, THE INFAMOUS QUOTE WHICH

02:14:13.245 --> 02:14:15.280
GOES ALONG IF YOU DON'T CARE

02:14:15.347 --> 02:14:17.082
ABOUT POLITICS, POLITICS WILL

02:14:17.149 --> 02:14:19.251
ONE DAY CARE ABOUT YOU. AND

02:14:19.317 --> 02:14:21.019
SADLY, OUR YOUTH TODAY DOES NOT

02:14:21.086 --> 02:14:24.089
HAVE THE RESOURCES REQUIRED TO

02:14:24.156 --> 02:14:27.592
HELP ACTUALLY PROVIDE AND VOICE

02:14:27.659 --> 02:14:29.294
THEIR OPINIONS. TODAY'S

02:14:29.361 --> 02:14:31.129
LEGISLATION HELPS EASE THE

02:14:31.196 --> 02:14:33.665
PROCESS AND MAKES IT SO THAT

02:14:33.732 --> 02:14:35.400
OTHER EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES

02:14:35.467 --> 02:14:37.335
ARE PROVIDED TO YOUTH, AS

02:14:37.402 --> 02:14:39.371
PROVIDED IN THE SENATE BILL.

02:14:39.438 --> 02:14:41.206
ACTIVITIES SUCH AS DEBATES AND

02:14:41.273 --> 02:14:43.442
MOCK TRIALS WILL BE PROVIDED

02:14:43.508 --> 02:14:45.510
THAT WAY SO OUR YOUTH CAN

02:14:45.577 --> 02:14:47.746
ACTUALLY EXPRESS THEIR OPINION.

02:14:47.813 --> 02:14:49.481
MOST IMPORTANTLY, RIGHT NOW,

02:14:49.548 --> 02:14:51.249
SCHOOL CURRICULUM ONLY REQUIRES

02:14:51.316 --> 02:14:53.585
ABOUT ONE YEAR AND A HALF OF

02:14:53.652 --> 02:14:54.653
CIVICS BASED EDUCATION, ONE IN

02:14:54.719 --> 02:14:57.088
EIGHTH GRADE IN WHICH OUR YOUTH

02:14:57.155 --> 02:14:59.291
LEARNS ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE

02:14:59.357 --> 02:15:01.827
UNITED STATES AND THE BASICS OF

02:15:01.893 --> 02:15:03.361
GOVERNMENT, AND HALF A SEMESTER

02:15:03.428 --> 02:15:04.996
IN HIGH SCHOOL IN WHICH YOU

02:15:05.063 --> 02:15:07.265
LEARN ABOUT MORE ABOUT CIVICS

02:15:07.332 --> 02:15:11.169
AND THE CURRENT AND THE WAY THAT

02:15:11.236 --> 02:15:13.004
LEGISLATION GOES. BUT THIS BILL

02:15:13.071 --> 02:15:15.140
DOES SOMETHING WHICH THOSE DO

02:15:15.207 --> 02:15:17.576
NOT. WHICH IS IT? IT HELPS BRING

02:15:17.642 --> 02:15:19.244
CIVICS OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM.

02:15:19.311 --> 02:15:20.846
IT MAKES IT SO RATHER THAN

02:15:20.912 --> 02:15:22.314
HAVING TO WRITE AN ESSAY AND

02:15:22.380 --> 02:15:23.949
HAVING TO EXPRESS YOUR OPINIONS

02:15:24.015 --> 02:15:26.651
BASED ON A GRADE, YOU'RE ABLE TO

02:15:26.718 --> 02:15:28.119
ACTUALLY EXPRESS YOUR OPINIONS

02:15:28.186 --> 02:15:29.754
OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM WITHOUT

02:15:29.821 --> 02:15:32.023
BEING AFRAID OF WHAT THOSE

02:15:32.090 --> 02:15:34.526
OPINIONS ARE. MORE. MORE

02:15:34.593 --> 02:15:35.627
IMPORTANTLY, THIS BILL MAKES IT

02:15:35.694 --> 02:15:38.196
SO THAT THOSE WHO ARE

02:15:38.263 --> 02:15:41.032
DISCONNECTED FROM POLITICS CAN

02:15:41.099 --> 02:15:44.002
HELP BRING IN, CAN HELP COME

02:15:44.069 --> 02:15:46.471
BACK IN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH,

TODAY. GOOD AFTERNOON, COMMITTEE

02:16:02.687 --> 02:16:04.422

02:16:04.489 --> 02:16:06.658
MEMBER OF POWER CALIFORNIA AND A

02:16:06.725 --> 02:16:08.059
MERCED RESIDENT. YOUNG

02:16:08.126 --> 02:16:09.294
CALIFORNIANS ARE ON TRACK TO BE

02:16:09.361 --> 02:16:10.896
THE LARGEST VOTING BLOCK IN

CALIFORNIA BY 2028, BUT OFTEN

02:16:12.797 --> 02:16:14.199
DON'T BECOME CIVICALLY ENGAGED

02:16:14.266 --> 02:16:16.268
UNTIL LATER IN LIFE. HOWEVER,

02:16:16.334 --> 02:16:18.036
WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THE

02:16:18.103 --> 02:16:19.604
EARLIER THEY ENGAGE IN OUR

02:16:19.671 --> 02:16:20.338
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, THE MORE

02:16:20.405 --> 02:16:21.306
LIKELY THEY ARE TO BECOME

02:16:21.373 --> 02:16:24.543
LIFELONG VOTERS. IN 2020, I WAS

02:16:24.609 --> 02:16:26.778
18 AND A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL,

02:16:26.845 --> 02:16:28.914
BUT I DIDN'T VOTE. NOT BECAUSE I

02:16:28.980 --> 02:16:30.715
DIDN'T WANT TO, BUT BECAUSE I

02:16:30.782 --> 02:16:32.183
REALLY DIDN'T KNOW HOW. NO ONE

02:16:32.250 --> 02:16:33.718
IN MY HIGH SCHOOL TALKED ABOUT

02:16:33.785 --> 02:16:35.353
THE IMPORTANCE OF VOTING OR WHAT

02:16:35.420 --> 02:16:37.622
IT WHAT MADE ME ELIGIBLE TO

02:16:37.689 --> 02:16:39.724
VOTE. IT WASN'T UNTIL A PEER

02:16:39.791 --> 02:16:42.193
FROM PARKER ACTION SHOWED ME HOW

02:16:42.260 --> 02:16:44.496
TO REGISTER, AND THE PROCESS FOR

02:16:44.563 --> 02:16:46.331
VOTING, THAT I BECAME CIVICALLY

02:16:46.398 --> 02:16:47.699
ENGAGED. I FEEL LIKE I MISSED

02:16:47.766 --> 02:16:49.401
OUT IN 2020, AND I STILL

02:16:49.467 --> 02:16:50.335
REMEMBER MY PASSION AROUND THAT

02:16:50.402 --> 02:16:52.103
ELECTION AND WANTING TO VOTE

02:16:52.170 --> 02:16:53.772
BECAUSE OF HOW IMPACTFUL THE

02:16:53.838 --> 02:16:55.507

OUR STUDENTS HAVE REGULARLY

02:18:47.218 --> 02:18:48.687
PARTICIPATED IN TWO PROGRAMS

02:18:48.753 --> 02:18:50.021
THAT ALLOW FOR EARLY

02:18:50.088 --> 02:18:51.556
REGISTRATION AWARENESS. ONE OF

02:18:51.623 --> 02:18:54.025
THEM IS THE MOTOR VOTER

02:18:54.092 --> 02:18:56.161
REGISTRATION PROCESS, AND THE

02:18:56.227 --> 02:18:57.529
OTHER ONE IS THE SHIRLEY AND

02:18:57.595 --> 02:18:58.930
WEBBER, WHO IS THE SECRETARY OF

02:18:58.997 --> 02:19:01.332
STATE VOTER REGISTRATION CONTEST

02:19:01.399 --> 02:19:04.069
THAT SHE HAS. AND I, AS SOMEONE

02:19:04.135 --> 02:19:07.305
WHO'S BEEN IN EDUCATION AND HAS

02:19:07.372 --> 02:19:08.273
THREE TEENAGE DAUGHTERS, ONE OF

02:19:08.339 --> 02:19:10.575
THEM ACTUALLY JUST TURNED 20,

02:19:10.642 --> 02:19:13.078
IT'S I HAVE SEEN HOW TACKLING AN

02:19:13.144 --> 02:19:14.145
EDUCATIONAL CHALLENGE FROM

02:19:14.212 --> 02:19:15.647
MULTIPLE DIFFERENT ANGLES HAS

02:19:15.714 --> 02:19:17.682
ALWAYS BEEN HELPFUL. SO MY

02:19:17.749 --> 02:19:19.651
QUESTION IS WHAT ARE WHAT WOULD

02:19:19.718 --> 02:19:22.087
THIS DO THAT THESE OTHER VOTER

02:19:22.153 --> 02:19:23.621
REGISTRATION EFFORTS HASN'T BEEN

02:19:23.688 --> 02:19:27.559
ABLE TO DO? MR. CHAIRMAN AND

02:19:27.625 --> 02:19:28.626
DOCTOR PATEL, THANK YOU FOR THE

02:19:28.693 --> 02:19:29.894
QUESTION. MY UNDERSTANDING FROM

02:19:29.961 --> 02:19:31.463
THE REFERENCE, I WAS PROVIDED BY

02:19:31.529 --> 02:19:32.363
THE SENATOR'S OFFICE AND IT MAY

02:19:32.430 --> 02:19:34.299
MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO YOU, IS

02:19:34.365 --> 02:19:35.600
THERE HAS BEEN BETWEEN THE

02:19:35.667 --> 02:19:39.671
YEARS. 2018 TO 21, A PRECIPITOUS

02:19:39.738 --> 02:19:41.139
DECLINE IN PARTICIPATION IN

02:19:41.206 --> 02:19:42.974
EXISTING AVAILABLE PROTOCOLS. I

02:19:43.041 --> 02:19:44.375
THINK THAT THE BILL LANGUAGE

02:19:44.442 --> 02:19:46.945
HERE STRENGTHENS THAT IMPETUS

02:19:47.011 --> 02:19:48.012
FOR LOCAL THE REQUIREMENTS FOR

02:19:48.079 --> 02:19:49.280
WHICH DISTRICTS HAVE TO COMPLY

02:19:49.347 --> 02:19:50.482
WITH MAKING THIS PROGRAM

02:19:50.548 --> 02:19:52.250
AVAILABLE AND AFFIRMATIVELY

02:19:52.317 --> 02:19:53.752
EDUCATE STUDENT POPULATION AND

02:19:53.818 --> 02:19:55.186
PARENTS ABOUT ITS AVAILABILITY

02:19:55.253 --> 02:19:57.689
AND EFFORT TO TRY TO RETURN

02:19:57.756 --> 02:19:59.190
THOSE TO PRIOR NUMBERS, WHICH

02:19:59.257 --> 02:20:02.026
WERE BASED ON A PRIOR ANNUAL

02:20:02.093 --> 02:20:04.329
REPORT THROUGH THE YEAR 2016,

02:20:04.395 --> 02:20:05.630
INCLUDED OVER 1.1 MILLION

02:20:05.697 --> 02:20:07.832
STUDENTS PARTICIPATING. THAT

02:20:07.899 --> 02:20:09.868
PRECIPITOUSLY DID DECLINE BY A

02:20:09.934 --> 02:20:12.103
SIGNIFICANT PERCENT, AS MUCH AS

02:20:12.170 --> 02:20:14.239
27% ANNUALLY IN THE LATTER

02:20:14.305 --> 02:20:15.673
BRACKET OF YEARS. SO THE. I

02:20:15.740 --> 02:20:17.075
BELIEVE THAT THE AUTHOR'S INTENT

02:20:17.142 --> 02:20:19.611
HERE IS TO TRY TO PROVIDE SOME

02:20:19.677 --> 02:20:21.446
TWEAKED TOOLING TO RETURN THOSE

02:20:21.513 --> 02:20:23.615
NUMBERS TO PRIOR PARTICIPATION.

02:20:23.681 --> 02:20:24.649
THANK YOU. CERTAINLY A NOBLE

02:20:24.716 --> 02:20:26.951
EFFORT. WE DO NEED TO INCREASE

02:20:27.018 --> 02:20:27.619
VOTER PARTICIPATION, ESPECIALLY

02:20:27.685 --> 02:20:29.487
IN OUR YOUNGER GENERATION OF

02:20:29.554 --> 02:20:30.722
PEOPLE, SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE

02:20:30.789 --> 02:20:32.056
SOME SELF-DETERMINATION IN THEIR

02:20:32.123 --> 02:20:34.392
OWN FUTURE. I AM ALSO, AS A

MANDATES. IT'S SOMETHING I TALK

02:20:38.129 --> 02:20:40.598
ABOUT ON A REGULAR BASIS.

02:20:40.665 --> 02:20:41.666
DEPENDING ON THE SCHOOL DISTRICT

02:20:41.733 --> 02:20:43.468
AND WHAT THEIR FUNDING

02:20:43.535 --> 02:20:46.104
AVAILABILITY IS AND ABILITY TO

ENACT THE PROGRAMS AS DESCRIBED,

02:20:48.239 --> 02:20:50.742
WOULD IT ALSO BE POSSIBLE FOR

02:20:50.809 --> 02:20:53.211
DISTRICTS IF THEY WERE NOT ABLE

02:20:53.278 --> 02:20:55.346
TO FUND ROBUST PROGRAMS TO

02:20:55.413 --> 02:20:56.681
SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS THROUGH

IGNORANCE AND LACK OF

HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS,

IN PARTICULAR CSU, RESULTED IN A

02:27:33.945 --> 02:27:36.047
REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE

02:27:36.113 --> 02:27:37.481

WERE ENACTED LAST YEAR. AND SO

02:27:41.586 --> 02:27:43.521
WE'RE GRATEFUL TO HIM FOR THAT.

02:27:43.588 --> 02:27:46.824
WE HAVE LONG BEEN FRUSTRATED NOT

02:27:46.891 --> 02:27:48.559
ONLY BECAUSE OF THE COMPLIANCE

02:27:48.626 --> 02:27:50.861
ISSUE AT THE HIGHER EDUCATION

02:27:50.928 --> 02:27:53.197
LEVEL, BUT THE LACK OF FOCUS ON

02:27:53.264 --> 02:27:56.500
ON TITLE NINE HARASSMENT,

02:27:56.567 --> 02:27:59.737
EDUCATION ENFORCEMENT COMPLIANCE

02:27:59.804 --> 02:28:02.873
IN K THROUGH 12 HAS JUST BEEN A

02:28:02.940 --> 02:28:04.508
NONSTARTER. IT'S IT REALLY HAS

02:28:04.575 --> 02:28:07.645
NOT HAD MUCH BEARING UP HERE IN

02:28:07.712 --> 02:28:10.548
TERMS OF TITLE NINE AND SEXUAL

02:28:10.615 --> 02:28:13.050
HARASSMENT ISSUES. AND ONE THING

02:28:13.117 --> 02:28:14.852
WE DO KNOW FROM THE NATIONAL

02:28:14.919 --> 02:28:18.055
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS THAT

02:28:18.122 --> 02:28:20.124
HARASSMENT AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE

02:28:20.191 --> 02:28:22.393
ON ON HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUSES, ON

02:28:22.460 --> 02:28:25.630
SCHOOL CAMPUSES IS VASTLY

02:28:25.696 --> 02:28:28.966
UNDERREPORTED. BUT EVEN THAT, WE

02:28:29.033 --> 02:28:31.469
KNOW THAT 50% OF HIGH SCHOOL

02:28:31.535 --> 02:28:35.840
YOUNG GIRLS HAVE REPORTED BEING

02:28:35.906 --> 02:28:37.241
SEXUALLY HARASSED AT SCHOOL.

02:28:37.308 --> 02:28:40.111
THEY NEED TO KNOW WHAT TO DO.

02:28:40.177 --> 02:28:41.345
THEY NEED TO KNOW WHAT TO HOW TO

02:28:41.412 --> 02:28:42.847
RESPOND. THEY NEED TO KNOW WHO

02:28:42.913 --> 02:28:44.382
TO GO TO, WHAT'S GOING TO

02:28:44.448 --> 02:28:45.449
HAPPEN, AND THAT IT WON'T FALL

02:28:45.516 --> 02:28:48.085
ON DEAF EARS. AND YOU CAN GOOGLE

02:28:48.152 --> 02:28:49.220
THE SUBJECT ANY DAY OF THE WEEK

02:28:49.287 --> 02:28:51.222
AND FIND KIDS WHO HAVE COMMITTED

02:28:51.289 --> 02:28:52.423
SUICIDE BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT.

02:28:52.490 --> 02:28:54.859
THEIR COMPLAINTS WENT UNHEARD

02:28:54.925 --> 02:28:55.993
AND LISTENED TO. THE SCHOOLS DID

02:28:56.060 --> 02:28:57.795
NOT COOPERATE. THEY DID NOT MOVE

02:28:57.862 --> 02:28:59.430
THEM INTO DIFFERENT CLASSROOMS.

02:28:59.497 --> 02:29:00.931
THEY JUST DIDN'T RESPOND. SO

02:29:00.998 --> 02:29:02.767
THIS BILL IS JUST SO ESSENTIAL

02:29:02.833 --> 02:29:04.502
IN MAKING SURE THAT OUR ALL OF

02:29:04.568 --> 02:29:07.571
OUR YOUNG STUDENTS KNOW WHAT TO

02:29:07.638 --> 02:29:09.540
DO. THEY THEY CAN RECOGNIZE WHAT

02:29:09.607 --> 02:29:11.075
THE HARASSMENT IS AND THE

02:29:11.142 --> 02:29:12.276
BULLYING, AND THEY ALSO KNOW

02:29:12.343 --> 02:29:14.478
WHAT TO DO WITH THAT AND WHO TO

02:29:14.545 --> 02:29:16.147
GO TO, AND THAT THERE IS A

02:29:16.213 --> 02:29:18.082
PROCESS IN PLACE AND IT WILL NOT

02:29:18.149 --> 02:29:19.383
ONLY HELP THE SCHOOLS FOCUS ON

02:29:19.450 --> 02:29:21.218
THIS, BUT IT WILL ALSO PROVIDE

02:29:21.285 --> 02:29:22.853
THIS INFORMATION TO STUDENTS AND

02:29:22.920 --> 02:29:23.421
PARENTS, WHICH WE THINK IS

02:29:23.487 --> 02:29:25.756
ESSENTIAL AND VERY CRITICAL. SO

02:29:25.823 --> 02:29:26.857
FOR THAT, WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL

02:29:26.924 --> 02:29:29.460

02:29:29.527 --> 02:29:32.263

02:31:36.086 --> 02:31:37.154
TO TRULY, DEEPLY THANK YOU FOR

02:31:37.221 --> 02:31:40.324
THIS. TWO YEARS AGO, I PASSED

02:31:40.391 --> 02:31:42.460
LEGISLATION TO LIFT THE STATUTE

02:31:42.526 --> 02:31:43.994
OF LIMITATIONS ON CHILD SEX

02:31:44.061 --> 02:31:46.063
ASSAULT. AND YOU CAN IMAGINE THE

02:31:46.130 --> 02:31:47.498
CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAD WITH A

02:31:47.565 --> 02:31:49.066
NUMBER OF INSTITUTIONS AND

02:31:49.133 --> 02:31:52.536
SCHOOL DISTRICTS, ETC, AROUND

02:31:52.603 --> 02:31:55.506
CHILD SEX ASSAULT AND THE LENGTH

02:31:55.573 --> 02:31:57.308
OF TIME THAT IT SOMETIMES TAKES

02:31:57.374 --> 02:31:59.410
PEOPLE TO COME FORWARD. AND IN

02:31:59.477 --> 02:32:01.245
EVERY ONE OF THOSE

02:32:01.312 --> 02:32:02.313
CONVERSATIONS, I WOULD BRING UP

02:32:02.379 --> 02:32:04.181
THE IDEA AROUND PREVENTION AND

02:32:04.248 --> 02:32:05.616
HOW WE NEED MORE TRAINING. WE

02:32:05.683 --> 02:32:07.251
NEED TO BE ON THE PREVENTATIVE

02:32:07.318 --> 02:32:08.686
SIDE OF THINGS AND HOW IMPORTANT

02:32:08.752 --> 02:32:10.621
THAT IS. AND SO THIS BILL, ALONG

02:32:10.688 --> 02:32:12.389
WITH ONE THAT WE HEARD EARLIER

02:32:12.456 --> 02:32:14.592
IN THIS, IN THIS HEARING, I

02:32:14.658 --> 02:32:16.227
THINK ARE ABSOLUTELY GOING IN

02:32:16.293 --> 02:32:18.562
THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I HOPE THAT

02:32:18.629 --> 02:32:20.197
THIS TRAINING WILL INCLUDE

02:32:20.264 --> 02:32:23.234
SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND SEXUAL

02:32:23.300 --> 02:32:26.270
ASSAULT BY ADULTS AND BY ADULTS

02:32:26.337 --> 02:32:28.272
THAT CHILDREN ARE EXPOSED TO. WE

02:32:28.339 --> 02:32:31.175
JUST HEARD VERY SENSITIVE AND I

02:32:31.242 --> 02:32:32.910
WOULD SAY JARRING TESTIMONY ON

02:32:32.977 --> 02:32:35.346
AN EARLIER BILL FROM SOMEBODY

02:32:35.412 --> 02:32:37.214
WHO HAD BEEN GROOMED ON CAMPUS.

02:32:37.281 --> 02:32:39.450
AND SO I HOPE THAT AS THIS

02:32:39.517 --> 02:32:41.519
LEGISLATION MOVES FORWARD, THERE

02:32:41.585 --> 02:32:43.053
WILL ALSO BE, WHEN IT GETS

02:32:43.120 --> 02:32:45.456
ACROSS THE LINE THAT THAT IT

02:32:45.523 --> 02:32:48.526
WILL CONTINUE, NOT JUST A FOCUS

02:32:48.592 --> 02:32:50.794
ON STUDENT TO STUDENT HARASSMENT

02:32:50.861 --> 02:32:52.263
AND ASSAULT, BUT ALSO WHEN THAT

02:32:52.329 --> 02:32:54.498
HAPPENS FROM ADULTS ON CAMPUSES.

02:32:54.565 --> 02:32:57.101
AND I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU AND

02:32:57.167 --> 02:32:59.870

02:42:50.293 --> 02:42:59.669
AND THAT IS. THAT I WOULD LIKE

02:42:59.736 --> 02:43:15.952
TO THANK THE.

02:43:44.414 --> 02:43:56.993
WE HAVE THE SENATOR. ALL RIGHT.

02:43:57.060 --> 02:44:01.531
BUSY DAY, SENATOR. CATCH YOUR

02:44:01.598 --> 02:44:10.273
BREATH THERE. WHILE YOU'RE

02:44:10.340 --> 02:44:13.910
GETTING SET UP. THIS IS FILE

02:44:13.977 --> 02:44:20.183
ITEM NUMBER 11. SENATE BILL 745.

02:44:20.250 --> 02:44:23.253
OUR LAST BILL OF TODAY'S

02:44:23.320 --> 02:44:27.357
HEARING. YOU WANT TO TURN YOUR

02:44:27.424 --> 02:44:32.095
MIC ON? OH, THERE WE GO.

02:44:32.162 --> 02:44:33.763
PERFECT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND

02:44:33.830 --> 02:44:37.033
I APOLOGIZE FOR THE DELAY. MR.

02:44:37.100 --> 02:44:38.935
CHAIR. MEMBERS, THANK YOU FOR

02:44:39.002 --> 02:44:41.638
THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT

02:44:41.705 --> 02:44:44.874
SENATE BILL 745. FIRST, I'D LIKE

02:44:44.941 --> 02:44:45.976
TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE'S

02:44:46.042 --> 02:44:47.978
AMENDMENTS AND THANK THE STAFF

02:44:48.044 --> 02:44:49.646
FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE.

02:44:49.713 --> 02:44:53.516
THANK YOU. AS AMENDED, SB 745

02:44:53.583 --> 02:44:54.651
DIRECTS THE CALIFORNIA

02:44:54.718 --> 02:44:56.353
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO WORK

02:44:56.419 --> 02:44:58.588
WITH COUNTY OFFICES TO DEVELOP

02:44:58.655 --> 02:45:01.124
CURRICULUM, GUIDE AND RESOURCES

02:45:01.191 --> 02:45:03.159
FOR ONE YEAR COURSE IN AMERICAN

02:45:03.226 --> 02:45:05.528
GOVERNMENT AND CIVICS.

02:45:05.595 --> 02:45:06.463
ADDITIONALLY, THIS BILL REQUIRES

02:45:06.529 --> 02:45:07.797
SCHOOL DISTRICTS PARTICIPATING

02:45:07.864 --> 02:45:09.733
IN THE STATE SEAL OF CIVIC

02:45:09.799 --> 02:45:11.134
ENGAGEMENT TO DEEM THE

02:45:11.201 --> 02:45:12.736
COMPLETION OF ONE YEAR COURSE.

02:45:12.802 --> 02:45:15.171
IN AMERICAN GOVERNMENT A CIVICS

02:45:15.238 --> 02:45:16.940
AND CIVICS AS SATISFYING THE

02:45:17.007 --> 02:45:18.708
CRITERIA FOR RECEIVING THE STATE

02:45:18.775 --> 02:45:22.045
SEAL. CURRENTLY, CALIFORNIA ONLY

02:45:22.112 --> 02:45:23.880
REQUIRES A ONE SEMESTER COURSE

02:45:23.947 --> 02:45:25.548
IN AMERICAN GOVERNMENT AND

02:45:25.615 --> 02:45:27.083
CIVICS FOR HIGH SCHOOL

02:45:27.150 --> 02:45:28.852
GRADUATION. THIS DOES NOT ALLOW

02:45:28.918 --> 02:45:29.986
SUFFICIENT TIME TO STUDY STATE

02:45:30.053 --> 02:45:32.722
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT PROCESSES.

02:45:32.789 --> 02:45:34.157
INADEQUATE CIVICS EDUCATION

02:45:34.224 --> 02:45:35.959
LEADS TO A LOWER VOTER TURNOUT,

02:45:36.026 --> 02:45:37.794
LACK OF ADVOCACY, AND A

02:45:37.861 --> 02:45:40.030
DIMINISHED ABILITY TO DISCERN

02:45:40.096 --> 02:45:42.766
INCORRECT INFORMATION. RESEARCH

02:45:42.832 --> 02:45:45.035
FROM THE US CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

02:45:45.101 --> 02:45:46.469
FOUNDATION SHOWED THAT MORE THAN

02:45:46.536 --> 02:45:49.839
70% OF AMERICANS FAIL A BASIC

02:45:49.906 --> 02:45:52.242
CIVICS LITERACY TEST, INCLUDING

02:45:52.309 --> 02:45:54.611
BASIC FACTS SUCH AS THE THREE

02:45:54.678 --> 02:45:55.445
BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT.

02:45:55.512 --> 02:45:57.247
ACCORDING TO PEW RESEARCH,

02:45:57.314 --> 02:45:58.648
NEARLY HALF OF YOUNG AMERICANS

02:45:58.715 --> 02:46:01.284
AGES 18 TO 29 PRIMARILY RECEIVE

02:46:01.351 --> 02:46:02.752
NEWS REGARDING POLITICS AND

02:46:02.819 --> 02:46:04.454
ELECTIONS THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA

02:46:04.521 --> 02:46:05.922
OUTLETS. WITH INCREASED

02:46:05.989 --> 02:46:07.791
POLITICAL POLARIZATION AND LACK

02:46:07.857 --> 02:46:09.392
OF CIVIL DISCOURSE.

02:46:09.459 --> 02:46:11.027
UNFORTUNATELY, CALIFORNIA'S

02:46:11.094 --> 02:46:13.229
EDUCATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO ADJUST

02:46:13.296 --> 02:46:14.297
TO MITIGATE THESE CURRENT

02:46:14.364 --> 02:46:17.500
STATISTICS AND TRENDS. SB 745

02:46:17.567 --> 02:46:19.336
AIMS TO ESTABLISH A STRONG

02:46:19.402 --> 02:46:19.936
FOUNDATION OF GOVERNMENT AND

02:46:20.003 --> 02:46:22.539
CIVICS EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS,

02:46:22.605 --> 02:46:24.574
ENABLING THEM TO UNDERSTAND KEY

02:46:24.641 --> 02:46:26.142
ISSUES, ENGAGE IN INFORMED

02:46:26.209 --> 02:46:27.110
DISCUSSIONS, AND RECOGNIZE THE

02:46:27.177 --> 02:46:29.346
IMPORTANCE OF THEIR VOTE. THE

02:46:29.412 --> 02:46:30.714
CURRICULUM WILL FOCUS ON LOCAL,

02:46:30.780 --> 02:46:32.482
STATE, AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

02:46:32.549 --> 02:46:33.950
PROCESSES, AS WELL AS THE

02:46:34.017 --> 02:46:37.153
IMPORTANCE OF VOTING, GREATER

02:46:37.220 --> 02:46:38.688
KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF

02:46:38.755 --> 02:46:40.490
GOVERNMENT PROCESSES INCREASES

02:46:40.557 --> 02:46:41.591
THE LIKELIHOOD OF CIVIC

02:46:41.658 --> 02:46:43.159
ENGAGEMENT, AND MAY HELP REVERSE

02:46:43.226 --> 02:46:44.728
CURRENT TRENDS AND STATISTICS

02:46:44.794 --> 02:46:47.864
AMONG YOUNG VOTERS. ULTIMATELY,

02:46:47.931 --> 02:46:49.099
A COMPREHENSIVE COURSE IN

02:46:49.165 --> 02:46:50.100
AMERICAN GOVERNMENT AND CIVICS

02:46:50.166 --> 02:46:51.668
WILL EMPOWER OUR NEXT GENERATION

02:46:51.735 --> 02:46:53.837
OF VOTERS TO BE BETTER INFORMED,

02:46:53.903 --> 02:46:55.605
MORE POLITICALLY ACTIVE

02:46:55.672 --> 02:46:56.573
CITIZENS. THIS WILL PROVIDE OUR

02:46:56.639 --> 02:46:58.174
SCHOOLS WITH A GUIDE ON HOW TO

02:46:58.241 --> 02:46:59.976
DO THAT. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT

02:47:00.043 --> 02:47:02.679
IS JULIA CHAMBERS WITH AMERICA

02:47:02.746 --> 02:47:06.082
UNDIVIDED AND EMILY. GORODETSKY.

02:47:06.149 --> 02:47:08.418
I HAD PROMISED THAT I APOLOGIZE,

02:47:08.485 --> 02:47:10.320
WHICH IS UKRAINIAN. A HIGH

02:47:10.387 --> 02:47:12.155
SCHOOL STUDENT FROM THE SAN

02:47:12.222 --> 02:47:13.490
FRANCISCO UNIFIED SCHOOL

02:47:13.556 --> 02:47:18.495
DISTRICT. ALL RIGHT. WELCOME.

02:47:18.561 --> 02:47:20.296
ALL RIGHT, MISTER CHAIR AND

02:47:20.363 --> 02:47:21.664
COMMITTEE MEMBERS, MY NAME IS

02:47:21.731 --> 02:47:23.299
JULIA CHAMBERS. I'M THE DIRECTOR

02:47:23.366 --> 02:47:24.601
OF AMERICA UNDIVIDED, THE

02:47:24.667 --> 02:47:26.536
SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. BUT MORE

02:47:26.603 --> 02:47:27.871
IMPORTANTLY, I AM A 17 YEAR OLD,

02:47:27.937 --> 02:47:29.305
A CALIFORNIA PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL

02:47:29.372 --> 02:47:31.608
STUDENT WHO HAS SEEN FIRSTHAND

02:47:31.674 --> 02:47:32.208
JUST HOW UNPREPARED MY

02:47:32.275 --> 02:47:34.077
GENERATION IS FOR DEMOCRACY. SO

02:47:34.144 --> 02:47:35.645
BACK WHEN SCHOOL WAS IN SESSION,

02:47:35.712 --> 02:47:37.280
I TRACKED DOWN EVERY SENIOR I

02:47:37.347 --> 02:47:38.114
COULD FIND, EACH ONE WHO HAD

02:47:38.181 --> 02:47:39.315
ALREADY TAKEN THE REQUIRED

02:47:39.382 --> 02:47:40.550
GOVERNMENT COURSE AND ASKED THEM

02:47:40.617 --> 02:47:42.552
A FEW BASIC QUESTIONS ABOUT

02:47:42.619 --> 02:47:44.354
CIVICS. NOT ONE SINGLE STUDENT

02:47:44.421 --> 02:47:45.889
COULD NAME A SINGLE

02:47:45.955 --> 02:47:47.290
REPRESENTATIVE, NOT THEIR

02:47:47.357 --> 02:47:48.792
CONGRESSMAN, SENATOR, STATE

02:47:48.858 --> 02:47:50.560
SENATOR, AND ESPECIALLY ASSEMBLY

02:47:50.627 --> 02:47:52.762
MEMBERS. ALMOST NONE PLANNED TO

02:47:52.829 --> 02:47:54.364
VOTE, AND ONLY A FEW ACTUALLY

02:47:54.431 --> 02:47:55.999
KNEW THAT STATES HAD THEIR OWN

02:47:56.065 --> 02:47:57.033
GOVERNMENTS. THAT THIS BUILDING

02:47:57.100 --> 02:47:59.235
THAT ANY OF YOU HERE ACTUALLY

02:47:59.302 --> 02:48:00.437
EXISTS. AND SO CLEARLY SOMETHING

02:48:00.503 --> 02:48:02.705
IS WRONG HERE. SO STUDIES FROM

02:48:02.772 --> 02:48:04.340
UCLA, UC RIVERSIDE, AND THE

02:48:04.407 --> 02:48:05.642
PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF

02:48:05.708 --> 02:48:07.010
CALIFORNIA SHOW THAT CALIFORNIA

02:48:07.076 --> 02:48:08.211
SCHOOLS ARE NOT PROVIDING

02:48:08.278 --> 02:48:10.313
ADEQUATE CIVIC EDUCATION, THAT

02:48:10.380 --> 02:48:12.148
65% OF CALIFORNIA PRINCIPALS

02:48:12.215 --> 02:48:13.850
REPORT MAJOR POLITICAL TENSIONS

02:48:13.917 --> 02:48:15.118
BETWEEN STUDENTS, AND THAT IN

02:48:15.185 --> 02:48:18.388
THE LAST ELECTION, ONLY 10% OF

02:48:18.455 --> 02:48:20.123
CALIFORNIANS AGED 18 TO 24

02:48:20.190 --> 02:48:21.958
VOTED. THAT'S FAR LESS THAN HALF

02:48:22.025 --> 02:48:23.993
OF THE NATIONAL YOUTH AVERAGE.

02:48:24.060 --> 02:48:25.462
THE GOVERNMENT COURSE MANDATED

02:48:25.528 --> 02:48:27.030
BY THE STATE ONLY COVERS THE

02:48:27.096 --> 02:48:28.331
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND

02:48:28.398 --> 02:48:29.499
CONSTITUTION. IN OUR CLASSES, WE

02:48:29.566 --> 02:48:31.401
DON'T GO OVER STATE AND LOCAL

02:48:31.468 --> 02:48:32.202
GOVERNMENTS OR HOW TO BE A

02:48:32.268 --> 02:48:34.070
CITIZEN AND PARTICIPATE IN OUR

02:48:34.137 --> 02:48:35.972
DEMOCRACY, OR TO TEACH US HOW TO

02:48:36.039 --> 02:48:37.707
HAVE PRODUCTIVE POLITICAL

02:48:37.774 --> 02:48:39.075
CONVERSATIONS. THE PROBLEM IS,

02:48:39.142 --> 02:48:40.510
WE ARE EXPECTED TO PARTICIPATE

02:48:40.577 --> 02:48:42.445
IN DEMOCRACY, BUT WE'RE NOT

02:48:42.512 --> 02:48:44.881
BEING TAUGHT HOW. SO SENATE BILL

02:48:44.948 --> 02:48:46.583
745 DOESN'T MANDATE A NEW CLASS.

02:48:46.649 --> 02:48:48.251
IT DOESN'T TELL TEACHERS HOW TO

02:48:48.318 --> 02:48:49.385
TEACH. BUT WHAT IT DOES IS

02:48:49.452 --> 02:48:50.353
PROVIDE RESOURCES AND A

02:48:50.420 --> 02:48:51.788
CURRICULUM GUIDE TO HELP

02:48:51.855 --> 02:48:52.856
SCHOOLS, DISTRICTS AND TEACHERS

02:48:52.922 --> 02:48:54.958
WHO WANT TO GO FURTHER, WHO WANT

02:48:55.024 --> 02:48:56.125
TO PROVIDE MORE IN-DEPTH

02:48:56.192 --> 02:48:57.494
GOVERNMENT INSTRUCTION AND REAL

02:48:57.560 --> 02:48:59.329
CIVIC LEARNING. IT EMPOWERS

02:48:59.395 --> 02:49:00.430
THESE SCHOOLS WITH THE TOOLS TO

02:49:00.497 --> 02:49:02.398
TEACH ABOUT STATE AND LOCAL

02:49:02.465 --> 02:49:03.132
GOVERNMENTS, CIVIL DISCOURSE,

02:49:03.199 --> 02:49:05.001
AND HOW STUDENTS CAN PARTICIPATE

02:49:05.068 --> 02:49:06.803
ACTIVELY IN OUR DEMOCRACY.

02:49:06.870 --> 02:49:08.104
TODAY, I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR

02:49:08.171 --> 02:49:10.874
YOUR AYE VOTE TO TAKE A STEP

02:49:10.940 --> 02:49:11.574
TOWARDS CREATING A MORE INFORMED

02:49:11.641 --> 02:49:14.878
AND ENGAGED ELECTORATE. THANK

02:49:14.944 --> 02:49:18.348
YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON,

02:49:18.414 --> 02:49:19.883
MR. CHAIR, AND MEMBERS OF THE

02:49:19.949 --> 02:49:21.718
COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS EMILY

02:49:21.784 --> 02:49:22.619
GORODETSKY, AND I'M A STUDENT AT

02:49:22.685 --> 02:49:24.454
THE SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED SCHOOL

02:49:24.521 --> 02:49:26.356
DISTRICT AND THE FOUNDER OF VÀ

02:49:26.422 --> 02:49:27.657
AND DEMOCRACY, A VIRTUAL REALITY

02:49:27.724 --> 02:49:29.392
HEADSET TRANSFORMING THE FUTURE

02:49:29.459 --> 02:49:33.596
OF CIVIC EDUCATION. LET ME BE

02:49:33.663 --> 02:49:35.532
HONEST, MOST OF MY PEERS HAVE NO

02:49:35.598 --> 02:49:37.100
IDEA HOW LOCAL GOVERNMENT WORKS,

02:49:37.166 --> 02:49:38.902
WHY WE AREN'T EXACTLY TAUGHT HOW

02:49:38.968 --> 02:49:40.470
TO REGISTER TO VOTE, WHAT OUR

02:49:40.537 --> 02:49:42.205
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS DO, OR EVEN

02:49:42.272 --> 02:49:44.040
WHY OUR VOTE MATTERS. AND IT

02:49:44.107 --> 02:49:46.476
SHOWS. A STUDY BY USC PRICE

02:49:46.543 --> 02:49:48.545
SHOWS THAT IN A RECENT ELECTION

02:49:48.611 --> 02:49:50.313
CYCLE, THE VOTER TURNOUT FOR 18

02:49:50.380 --> 02:49:52.682
TO 24 YEAR OLDS WAS THE LOWEST

02:49:52.749 --> 02:49:54.417
PERCENTAGE COMPARED TO ALL OTHER

02:49:54.484 --> 02:49:56.553
AGE GROUPS. AND THAT'S JUST

02:49:56.619 --> 02:49:58.421
THAT'S NOT JUST A FACT. THAT'S

02:49:58.488 --> 02:50:00.490
MY GENERATION TUNING OUT OF

02:50:00.557 --> 02:50:02.992
DEMOCRACY. BUT WHY? IT'S BECAUSE

02:50:03.059 --> 02:50:04.861
WE'RE NOT BEING PREPARED. WE

02:50:04.928 --> 02:50:06.596
TAKE BIOLOGY CLASSES TO PREPARE

02:50:06.663 --> 02:50:08.231
FOR SCIENCE CAREERS AND COMPUTER

02:50:08.298 --> 02:50:09.232
SCIENCE CLASSES TO PREPARE FOR

02:50:09.299 --> 02:50:10.967
TECH CAREERS. BUT WHERE IS THE

02:50:11.034 --> 02:50:13.036
CLASS THAT TEACHES US TO BE

02:50:13.102 --> 02:50:15.004
INFORMED, ENGAGED VOTERS? RIGHT

02:50:15.071 --> 02:50:17.440
NOW, CALIFORNIA ONLY REQUIRES

02:50:17.507 --> 02:50:18.841
ONE SEMESTER OF CIVICS, AND I

02:50:18.908 --> 02:50:20.009
REACHED OUT TO THE TEACHER OF

02:50:20.076 --> 02:50:22.545
THAT CLASS AT MY SCHOOL AND SHE

02:50:22.612 --> 02:50:24.647
SAID, THIS ONE SEMESTER IS NOT

02:50:24.714 --> 02:50:26.215
ENOUGH. AS TEACHERS, WE HAVE TO

02:50:26.282 --> 02:50:27.951
CHERRY PICK INFORMATION TO

02:50:28.017 --> 02:50:29.385
DELIVER, AND WE CAN ONLY FOCUS

02:50:29.452 --> 02:50:31.120
ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I

02:50:31.187 --> 02:50:32.555
THINK NOW MORE THAN EVER,

02:50:32.622 --> 02:50:33.957
STUDENTS NEED THIS AMERICAN

02:50:34.023 --> 02:50:35.858
DEMOCRACY CLASS, AND I CAN'T

02:50:35.925 --> 02:50:38.027
AGREE MORE. IN A WORLD OF

02:50:38.094 --> 02:50:40.129
POLITICAL POLARIZATION, ONLINE

02:50:40.196 --> 02:50:41.931
MISINFORMATION AND RISING

DISTRUST, STUDENTS NEED MORE

THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE THAT SENATE

02:50:46.803 --> 02:50:49.973

02:51:05.355 --> 02:51:07.523
IMPORTANTLY, REALIZE OUR OWN

02:51:07.590 --> 02:51:10.126
POWER. AS EDUCATED CITIZENS, WE

02:51:10.193 --> 02:51:11.828

IF WE WANT THAT FUTURE TO BE

02:51:14.197 --> 02:51:16.099
STRONG AND BRIGHT, WE NEED TO

02:51:16.165 --> 02:51:18.101
