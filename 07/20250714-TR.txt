WE HAVE OUR A QUORUM PRESENT, WE

BILLS THAT WE'RE HEARING TODAY.

01:42:34.114 --> 01:42:36.083

DISCUSSIONS TO MOVE THE BILL

01:43:46.687 --> 01:43:47.387
FORWARD. WE'VE PERSONALLY TALKED

01:43:47.454 --> 01:43:49.823
AND TEXT ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS

01:43:49.890 --> 01:43:51.692
AFTER HOURS, EARLY HOURS IN THE

01:43:51.758 --> 01:43:53.060
MORNING, AND YOU HAVE BEEN

01:43:53.126 --> 01:43:54.294
REALLY COMMITTED TO HELP ME MOVE

01:43:54.361 --> 01:43:56.029
THIS BILL FORWARD. AND I JUST

01:43:56.096 --> 01:43:58.498

01:43:59.933 --> 01:44:02.135
SENATE TRANSPORTATION CHAIR,

01:44:02.202 --> 01:44:04.805
SENATOR CORTEZ. HE'S MY JOINT

01:44:04.871 --> 01:44:06.473
AUTHOR, AND HE HAS JUST BEEN

01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:08.542
INCREDIBLE ADVOCATE FOR THIS

01:44:08.609 --> 01:44:10.477
BILL. HE ACTUALLY IS A CLASSIC

01:44:10.544 --> 01:44:13.313
CAR OWNER, AND HE UNDERSTANDS

01:44:13.380 --> 01:44:15.248
IT. IN A FUNNY STORY, IT WAS HIS

01:44:15.315 --> 01:44:16.316
MECHANIC THAT CALLED AND SAID,

01:44:16.383 --> 01:44:18.685
CALL DAVE CORTEZ. AND BECAUSE HE

01:44:18.752 --> 01:44:20.253
OWNS CLASSIC CARS. SO I THOUGHT

01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:22.856
THAT WAS REALLY GOOD THAT THIS

01:44:22.923 --> 01:44:23.457
IS A TRUE BIPARTISAN BILL. I

01:44:23.523 --> 01:44:24.825
WILL BE ACCEPTING THE

01:44:24.891 --> 01:44:25.959
COMMITTEE'S AMENDMENTS. I THANK

01:44:26.026 --> 01:44:27.160
YOU FOR GOING AGAIN BACK AND

01:44:27.227 --> 01:44:28.996
FORTH WITH THE COMMITTEE

01:44:29.062 --> 01:44:29.496
AMENDMENTS, AS I DIDN'T

01:44:29.563 --> 01:44:30.530
UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS DROPPED,

01:44:30.597 --> 01:44:32.032
WHAT WAS BROUGHT FORTH. AND YOU

01:44:32.099 --> 01:44:34.134
WERE VERY GRACIOUS WITH WITH

01:44:34.201 --> 01:44:35.202
YOUR TIME WITH THESE AMENDMENTS.

01:44:35.268 --> 01:44:36.670
AMENDMENTS. SENATE BILL 712,

01:44:36.737 --> 01:44:38.305
ALSO KNOWN AS LENO'S LAW, WILL

01:44:38.372 --> 01:44:39.940
BE EXTENDING AND WILL EXTEND A

01:44:40.007 --> 01:44:41.675
FULL SMOG CHECKED EXEMPTION FOR

01:44:41.742 --> 01:44:43.810
CLASSIC VEHICLES WITH MODEL

01:44:43.877 --> 01:44:46.279
YEARS 1976 TO 1986 ADDING TEN

01:44:46.346 --> 01:44:48.749

A FIVE YEAR PERIOD, WITH A

SUNSET PROVISION IN 2032.

01:44:52.786 --> 01:44:54.488
AMENDMENTS TAKEN IN THE SENATE

01:44:54.554 --> 01:44:55.889
APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ENSURE

01:44:55.956 --> 01:45:00.260
THAT THE EXEMPTION ONLY APPLIES

01:45:00.327 --> 01:45:02.095
TO CLASSIC AND COLLECTIBLE CARS

01:45:02.162 --> 01:45:03.163
REQUIRING COLLECTOR MOTOR

01:45:03.230 --> 01:45:04.631

REGISTRATION OF HISTORIC LICENSE

01:45:06.099 --> 01:45:08.268
PLATE THROUGH THE DMV, AND THE

01:45:08.335 --> 01:45:10.070
PROGRAM IS OPTIONAL, NOT

01:45:10.137 --> 01:45:12.873
MANDATORY. THE MEANS OF THE

01:45:12.939 --> 01:45:14.374
MEANS. THIS MEANS THAT THIS BILL

01:45:14.441 --> 01:45:16.043
IS NARROWLY TAILORED TO ADDRESS

01:45:16.109 --> 01:45:17.878
CONCERNS ABOUT

01:45:17.944 --> 01:45:19.012
SELF-CERTIFICATION. TO QUALIFY

01:45:19.079 --> 01:45:20.814
FOR A CLASSIC HISTORIC MOTOR

01:45:20.881 --> 01:45:22.649
VEHICLE, INSURANCE, OWNERS MUST

01:45:22.716 --> 01:45:24.451
LIMIT THE MILEAGE DRIVEN EACH

01:45:24.518 --> 01:45:26.586
YEAR AND MAINTAIN A SEPARATE

01:45:26.653 --> 01:45:29.122
DAILY DRIVING VEHICLE TO ENSURE

01:45:29.189 --> 01:45:30.991
COMPLIANCE. IN SOME CASES,

01:45:31.058 --> 01:45:32.159
ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS APPLY,

01:45:32.225 --> 01:45:34.161
SUCH AS STORING THE VEHICLE IN A

01:45:34.227 --> 01:45:35.362
LOCKED GARAGE OR BEHIND A LOCKED

01:45:35.429 --> 01:45:37.364
FENCE. THIS IS STRINGENT

01:45:37.431 --> 01:45:39.166
SAFEGUARDS TO ENSURE THAT ONLY

01:45:39.232 --> 01:45:41.101
TRUE CLASSIC CAR VEHICLES

01:45:41.168 --> 01:45:42.803
QUALIFY FOR THE INSURANCE, AND

01:45:42.869 --> 01:45:44.671
THEREFORE FOR SMOG CHECK

01:45:44.738 --> 01:45:46.239
EXEMPTIONS. PREVIOUSLY,

01:45:46.306 --> 01:45:48.542
CALIFORNIA HAD LED A 25 YEAR

01:45:48.608 --> 01:45:50.043
ROLLING SMOG CHECK EXEMPTION FOR

01:45:50.110 --> 01:45:53.180
CERTAIN VEHICLES, WHICH ENDED IN

01:45:53.246 --> 01:45:55.015
2005. LENO'S LAW WOULD HAVE

01:45:55.082 --> 01:45:56.650
RESTORED THAT MODERNIZATION,

01:45:56.717 --> 01:45:58.585
WITH THAT EXEMPTION ADDING AN

01:45:58.652 --> 01:46:00.120
ADDITIONAL TEN YEARS TO REFLECT

01:46:00.187 --> 01:46:01.688
THE PASSAGE OF TIME. RESPONDING

01:46:01.755 --> 01:46:02.989
TO A LONG STANDING REQUEST BY

01:46:03.056 --> 01:46:05.492
CAR COLLECTORS. ACCORDING TO THE

01:46:05.559 --> 01:46:06.893
CALIFORNIA DMV, VEHICLES

01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:10.197
MANUFACTURED BETWEEN 1976 AND

01:46:10.263 --> 01:46:12.733
1991 MAKE UP ONLY 1% OF ALL THE

01:46:12.799 --> 01:46:13.867
REGISTERED VEHICLES IN THE

01:46:13.934 --> 01:46:16.303
STATE, AND THE NUMBER IS

01:46:16.369 --> 01:46:18.772
CONSIDERED A TRUE CLASSIC. CAR

01:46:18.839 --> 01:46:20.340
OWNERS IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER

01:46:20.407 --> 01:46:23.176
THAN THAT NUMBER. WE'RE TALKING

01:46:23.243 --> 01:46:24.578
ABOUT LESS THAN 1% OF THE

01:46:24.644 --> 01:46:25.712
REGISTERED VEHICLES BEING

01:46:25.779 --> 01:46:27.180
ELIGIBLE UNDER THE ORIGINAL 35

01:46:27.247 --> 01:46:29.583
YEAR EXEMPTION. NOW, WITH THAT

01:46:29.649 --> 01:46:30.984
EXEMPTION HAS BEEN NARROWED TO

01:46:31.051 --> 01:46:33.553
JUST TEN YEARS. THE IMPACT

01:46:33.620 --> 01:46:35.055
SHOULD ONLY BE A FRACTION OF

01:46:35.122 --> 01:46:36.490
THAT. WELL UNDER 1% OF THE

01:46:36.556 --> 01:46:37.858
VEHICLES REGISTERED IN

01:46:37.924 --> 01:46:39.693
CALIFORNIA. MY JOINT AUTHOR HAS

01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:41.528
JUST JOINED US, AND I'LL JUST

01:46:41.595 --> 01:46:42.896
BRIEFLY TELL HIM. I DID

01:46:42.963 --> 01:46:43.697
COMPLIMENT YOU VERY MUCH, SIR,

01:46:43.764 --> 01:46:45.365
FOR BEING THE SENATE

01:46:45.432 --> 01:46:46.066
TRANSPORTATION CHAIR AND

01:46:46.133 --> 01:46:47.167
UNDERSTANDING AND HELPING ME

01:46:47.234 --> 01:46:50.437
WITH THIS BILL. THE UNFORTUNATE

01:46:50.504 --> 01:46:51.838
REALITY IS, IN MANY CALIFORNIA,

01:46:51.905 --> 01:46:53.039
SMOG CHECK STATIONS ARE NOT

01:46:53.106 --> 01:46:54.141
EQUIPPED WITH THE TOOLS

01:46:54.207 --> 01:46:55.876
NECESSARY TO PERFORM EMISSIONS

01:46:55.942 --> 01:46:57.511
TEST FOR THESE CLASSIC VEHICLES.

01:46:57.577 --> 01:46:59.112
THERE ARE A LOT OF SMOG CHECK

01:46:59.179 --> 01:47:00.380
STATIONS AND ALL OF OUR

01:47:00.447 --> 01:47:02.349
DISTRICTS, BUT VERY FEW OF THEM

01:47:02.415 --> 01:47:03.183
HAVE THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF

01:47:03.250 --> 01:47:05.385
EQUIPMENT THAT ALLOWS THE TIRES

01:47:05.452 --> 01:47:08.088
TO ROLL AND FOR THE INSTRUMENT

01:47:08.155 --> 01:47:10.023
TO BE PUT UP THE TAILPIPE TO

01:47:10.090 --> 01:47:11.358
MEASURE THE CARBON EMISSIONS.

01:47:11.424 --> 01:47:13.260
AFTER 1995, YOU JUST PLUG IT

01:47:13.326 --> 01:47:15.562
INTO THE DASH AND IT MAKES

01:47:15.629 --> 01:47:17.030
THINGS A LOT SIMPLER. I CAN TELL

01:47:17.097 --> 01:47:18.365
YOU THAT CAR ENTHUSIASTS ACROSS

01:47:18.431 --> 01:47:19.833
THE STATE HAVE CONTACTED MY

01:47:19.900 --> 01:47:21.168
OFFICE TO EXPRESS HOW DIFFICULT

01:47:21.234 --> 01:47:23.637
IT IS TO FIND A SMOG SMOG CHECK

01:47:23.703 --> 01:47:25.071
STATION WITH THE APPROPRIATE

01:47:25.138 --> 01:47:26.406
EQUIPMENT TO TEST THEIR

01:47:26.473 --> 01:47:28.074
VEHICLES. THE INTENT OF LENO'S

01:47:28.141 --> 01:47:30.177
LAW IS TO CREATE LESS BURDEN FOR

01:47:30.243 --> 01:47:31.878
OWNERS OF CLASSIC CARS THAT ARE

01:47:31.945 --> 01:47:33.980
RARELY DRIVEN AND KEPT IN

01:47:34.047 --> 01:47:35.816
BEAUTIFUL MINT CONDITION.

01:47:35.882 --> 01:47:37.651
ALTHOUGH JAY LENO COULDN'T BE

01:47:37.717 --> 01:47:39.119
HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY AT THIS

01:47:39.186 --> 01:47:41.054
HEARING, I'M GLAD THAT HE WAS A

01:47:41.121 --> 01:47:43.089
SPONSOR OF THIS BILL AND BROUGHT

01:47:43.156 --> 01:47:44.191
IT TO MY ATTENTION WHEN I WENT

01:47:44.257 --> 01:47:46.526
DOWN ON A TOUR OF HIS GARAGE.

01:47:46.593 --> 01:47:48.128
THESE CARS ARE ROLLING PIECES OF

01:47:48.195 --> 01:47:49.496
HISTORY. THEY'RE RICH IN

01:47:49.563 --> 01:47:51.331
CULTURE, CRAFTSMANSHIP, AND

01:47:51.398 --> 01:47:52.766
MEANING, AND THEY DESERVE TO BE

01:47:52.833 --> 01:47:54.234
PRESERVED FOR GENERATIONS TO

01:47:54.301 --> 01:47:56.002
COME. IN MANY CASES, CLASSIC CAR

01:47:56.069 --> 01:47:57.571
VEHICLES ARE SOLD OUT OF STATE

01:47:57.637 --> 01:47:59.339
DUE TO THE STRINGENT SMOG CHECK

01:47:59.406 --> 01:48:00.140
REQUIREMENTS, SPECIFICALLY ON

01:48:00.207 --> 01:48:01.741
THE TIME OF TRANSFER, AND

01:48:01.808 --> 01:48:04.244
MEANING THAT CALIFORNIA DOESN'T

01:48:04.311 --> 01:48:06.079
RECEIVE THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS

01:48:06.146 --> 01:48:08.348
FOR THAT. THIS, TO PUT IT IN

01:48:08.415 --> 01:48:09.649
PERSPECTIVE, THE SPECIALTY

01:48:09.716 --> 01:48:11.518
AUTOMOTIVE EQUIPMENT AFTERMARKET

01:48:11.585 --> 01:48:13.520
INDUSTRY CONTRIBUTES 40 BILLION.

01:48:13.587 --> 01:48:15.822
THAT'S $40 BILLION OF ECONOMIC

01:48:15.889 --> 01:48:17.524
ACTIVITY THROUGH CALIFORNIA. AND

01:48:17.591 --> 01:48:19.759
WE BENEFIT FROM ABOUT 150,000

01:48:19.826 --> 01:48:22.529
JOBS THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. AND

01:48:22.596 --> 01:48:24.130
$6.16 BILLION IN TAX REVENUE IS

01:48:24.197 --> 01:48:26.800
TIED TO THIS SECTOR. IT EXTENDS

01:48:26.867 --> 01:48:29.202
IT EXTENDS TO TIRE SHOPS, PAINT

01:48:29.269 --> 01:48:31.071
SHOPS, UPHOLSTERY SHOPS. THERE'S

01:48:31.137 --> 01:48:33.506
A LOWRIDER CANDY APPLE RED

01:48:33.573 --> 01:48:34.908
IMPALA THAT WAS NEXT TO US,

01:48:34.975 --> 01:48:37.010
BOUNCING DOWN THE ROAD AT THE

01:48:37.077 --> 01:48:38.144
PARADE THAT WE HAD, AND THEY HAD

01:48:38.211 --> 01:48:39.913
INVESTED A LOT OF TIME AND MONEY

01:48:39.980 --> 01:48:41.348
INTO JUST THE SPECIALTY DIAMOND

01:48:41.414 --> 01:48:44.985
TUCKED INTERIOR ENTHUSIAST

01:48:45.051 --> 01:48:46.620
MODIFIED THEIR CARS TO LOWRIDERS

01:48:46.686 --> 01:48:47.921
AND GAVE THEM ELABORATE COLOR

01:48:47.988 --> 01:48:49.589
PAINT JOBS. THIS IS A CULTURAL

01:48:49.656 --> 01:48:51.157
THING. JUST RECENTLY, IN THE

01:48:51.224 --> 01:48:52.158
PAST FEW YEARS, THE GOVERNOR

01:48:52.225 --> 01:48:54.394
SIGNED A BILL LEGALIZING

01:48:54.461 --> 01:48:56.263
CRUISING AGAIN FOR LOWRIDER

01:48:56.329 --> 01:48:58.732
CLUBS. SB SEVEN 1212 BUILDS ON

01:48:58.798 --> 01:49:00.400
THAT COMMITMENT TO ENSURE THAT

01:49:00.467 --> 01:49:01.534
INDIVIDUALS, REGARDLESS OF

01:49:01.601 --> 01:49:02.669
BACKGROUND, CAN PARTICIPATE IN

01:49:02.736 --> 01:49:04.404
CAR CULTURE AND ENJOY THE RIGHT

01:49:04.471 --> 01:49:07.040
TO PRESERVE THEIR VEHICLES. MY

01:49:07.107 --> 01:49:09.075
HOPE IS THAT WHEN I INTRODUCE

01:49:09.142 --> 01:49:10.844
LENO'S LAW WAS TO PROVIDE A FULL

01:49:10.911 --> 01:49:12.479
EXEMPTION FOR VEHICLES 35 YEARS

01:49:12.545 --> 01:49:15.015
OR OLDER, AND UPON TRANSFER,

01:49:15.081 --> 01:49:16.383
I'VE HEARD FROM MANY CAR

01:49:16.449 --> 01:49:17.417
ENTHUSIASTS ACROSS THE STATE

01:49:17.484 --> 01:49:19.819
ABOUT THE CONCERN FOR CHANGING

01:49:19.886 --> 01:49:22.722
OUT THEIR ORIGINAL PLATES. AND

01:49:22.789 --> 01:49:23.990
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO, YOU KNOW,

01:49:24.057 --> 01:49:25.625
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE THEY

01:49:25.692 --> 01:49:27.394
WANT TO USE THEIR ORIGINAL

01:49:27.460 --> 01:49:28.228
PLATES AND IN-STOCK PLATES AND

01:49:28.295 --> 01:49:30.163
NOT THE DMV PLATES. BUT I KNOW

01:49:30.230 --> 01:49:31.798
THAT THEY KNOW THIS PROGRAM IS

01:49:31.865 --> 01:49:32.599
OPTIONAL, ONLY AVAILABLE TO THEM

01:49:32.666 --> 01:49:35.068
AS AN OPTION TO BE ABLE TO GET

01:49:35.135 --> 01:49:36.569
THE SMOG EXEMPTION. BUT I ALSO

01:49:36.636 --> 01:49:37.871
KNOW THAT SB 712 REMAINS A

01:49:37.938 --> 01:49:38.438
MEANINGFUL STEP FORWARD FOR

01:49:38.505 --> 01:49:39.673
COLLECTOR CAR ENTHUSIASTS. I'M

01:49:39.739 --> 01:49:41.107
GRATEFUL TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

01:49:41.174 --> 01:49:42.509

ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE, AND I THINK

01:49:46.346 --> 01:49:48.048
I'M JUST GOING TO TURN IT OVER

01:49:48.114 --> 01:49:52.652
TO MY PRINCIPAL JOINT AUTHOR.

01:49:52.719 --> 01:49:54.387
I'M PROUD TO BE A JOINT AUTHOR

DONE ON THIS BILL. AND I JUST

01:50:01.995 --> 01:50:03.897
WANT TO THANK EVERYONE INVOLVED

AND I'LL STOP THERE AND TURN IT

THE CALIFORNIA LOWRIDER

01:50:52.412 --> 01:50:55.315
ALLIANCE. THE SLC IS A NONPROFIT

01:50:55.382 --> 01:50:56.182
ORGANIZATION PROUDLY ROOTED IN

01:50:56.249 --> 01:50:58.685
THE PRESERVATION, EDUCATION, AND

01:50:58.752 --> 01:51:00.987
CELEBRATION OF LOWRIDER, OUR

01:51:01.054 --> 01:51:02.922
LOWRIDER CULTURE AND LIFESTYLE.

01:51:02.989 --> 01:51:04.357
I'M HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF

01:51:04.424 --> 01:51:06.459
SENATE BILL 712, ALSO KNOWN AS

01:51:06.526 --> 01:51:08.128
LENO'S LAW, BECAUSE THIS BILL

01:51:08.194 --> 01:51:09.429
REPRESENTS FAR MORE THAN CHANGE

01:51:09.496 --> 01:51:12.232
IN SMOG CHECK REQUIREMENTS. IT'S

01:51:12.298 --> 01:51:13.867
ABOUT PRESERVING CULTURE,

01:51:13.933 --> 01:51:15.735
PROTECTING HISTORY, AND

01:51:15.802 --> 01:51:18.004
PROMOTING EQUITY FOR COLLECTORS,

01:51:18.071 --> 01:51:19.039
COMMUNITIES AND CALIFORNIA'S

01:51:19.105 --> 01:51:21.574
RICH CAR CULTURE. LOWRIDING HAS

01:51:21.641 --> 01:51:23.276
ALWAYS BEEN MORE THAN JUST CARS.

01:51:23.343 --> 01:51:25.845
IT'S ART ON WHEELS. IT'S A

01:51:25.912 --> 01:51:28.748
ROLLING EXPRESSION OF HERITAGE,

01:51:28.815 --> 01:51:30.550
IDENTITY AND CREATIVITY. IT

01:51:30.617 --> 01:51:32.152
BRINGS TOGETHER OUR FAMILIES,

01:51:32.218 --> 01:51:34.087
OUR GENERATIONS, AND OUR

01:51:34.154 --> 01:51:35.655
NEIGHBORHOODS. IT BUILDS

01:51:35.722 --> 01:51:37.457
COMMUNITY. IT SPARKS JOY. AND

01:51:37.524 --> 01:51:40.026
YES, IT HEALS. EVEN DURING THE

01:51:40.093 --> 01:51:41.227
PANDEMIC, WE SAW HOW LOWRIDING

01:51:41.294 --> 01:51:42.829
BROUGHT PEOPLE PEACE AND

01:51:42.896 --> 01:51:44.597
PURPOSE. THAT'S HOW CULTURE

01:51:44.664 --> 01:51:46.633
STARTED. RESEARCH SHOWS CULTURAL

01:51:46.699 --> 01:51:48.535
CONNECTION IMPROVES YOUR MENTAL

01:51:48.601 --> 01:51:50.136
HEALTH. AS FOR MANY OF US,

01:51:50.203 --> 01:51:52.138
CRUISING IS OUR THERAPY.

01:51:52.205 --> 01:51:53.540
HOWEVER, MANY LOWRIDER AND

01:51:53.606 --> 01:51:55.175
CLASSIC CAR OWNERS HAVE A VERY

01:51:55.241 --> 01:51:56.776
DIFFICULT TIME FINDING SMOG

01:51:56.843 --> 01:51:57.911
STATIONS THAT HAVE THE CORRECT

01:51:57.977 --> 01:51:59.312
EQUIPMENT AND WILL DO IT FOR A

01:51:59.379 --> 01:52:01.514
REASONABLE PRICE, BECAUSE

01:52:01.581 --> 01:52:03.616
MAINTAINING THE BAR 97 EMISSIONS

01:52:03.683 --> 01:52:05.151
EQUIPMENT REQUIRED TO TEST THESE

01:52:05.218 --> 01:52:07.654
OLDER CARS IS COSTLY AND IT'S

01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:10.523
RARELY USED. THIS LEAVES US WITH

01:52:10.590 --> 01:52:11.858
AN INABILITY TO GET OUR VEHICLES

01:52:11.925 --> 01:52:13.426
SMOGGED, ENSURING WE ARE

01:52:13.493 --> 01:52:16.296
COMPLIANT WITH STATE LAW. SB 12

01:52:16.362 --> 01:52:18.098
OFFERS A PRACTICAL AND CULTURAL

01:52:18.164 --> 01:52:19.866
AWARE SOLUTION, EXEMPTING

01:52:19.933 --> 01:52:21.267
COLLECTOR CARS FROM CALIFORNIA'S

01:52:21.334 --> 01:52:23.536
SMOG CHECK PROGRAM. THESE

01:52:23.603 --> 01:52:24.938
VEHICLES ARE NOT JUST DAILY

01:52:25.004 --> 01:52:26.339
DRIVERS. THEY ARE RARELY USED,

01:52:26.406 --> 01:52:28.108
CAREFULLY MAINTAINED AND DEEPLY

01:52:28.174 --> 01:52:29.943
LOVED FOR OUR CULTURAL AND

01:52:30.009 --> 01:52:32.078
HISTORIC VALUE. THIS IS THE

01:52:32.145 --> 01:52:33.913
FIRST TIME IN OVER 20 YEARS THAT

01:52:33.980 --> 01:52:35.682
CALIFORNIA IS EXPANDING THE SMOG

01:52:35.748 --> 01:52:38.184
EXEMPTION BEYOND 1976, MAKING

01:52:38.251 --> 01:52:40.487
THIS A HISTORIC WIN FOR CAR

01:52:40.553 --> 01:52:41.421
ENTHUSIASTS AND COMMUNITIES WHO

01:52:41.488 --> 01:52:43.790
HAVE LONG BEEN OVERLOOKED. WHILE

01:52:43.857 --> 01:52:45.458
THE CURRENT LANGUAGE DOES NOT

01:52:45.525 --> 01:52:47.193
INCLUDE EVERYTHING THAT OUR

01:52:47.260 --> 01:52:49.395
COMMUNITY HAS HOPED FOR, IT IS

01:52:49.462 --> 01:52:50.964
MEANINGFUL PROGRESS THAT MOVES

01:52:51.030 --> 01:52:52.665
US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. TO

01:52:52.732 --> 01:52:55.602
HAVE YOU WRAP UP. IT PROVIDES

01:52:55.668 --> 01:52:57.670
OVERDUE TO OWNERS. OH, SORRY.

01:52:57.737 --> 01:52:59.005
WELL, I'LL JUST SKIP TO THIS

01:52:59.072 --> 01:53:00.607
THAT LOWRIDERS AREN'T JUST A

01:53:00.673 --> 01:53:02.041
TRADITION. THEY'RE AN ECONOMIC

01:53:02.108 --> 01:53:03.443
ENGINE. HERE IN SACRAMENTO, OUR

01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:05.645
COMMUNITY HOSTS OVER 80 TO 100

01:53:05.712 --> 01:53:07.046
EVENTS A YEAR. THAT'S MORE THAN

01:53:07.113 --> 01:53:09.916
1500 HOURS OF COMMUNITY SERVICE.

01:53:09.983 --> 01:53:11.417
IT BRINGS. AND I'LL HAVE TO HAVE

01:53:11.484 --> 01:53:13.253

TO TAKE THE SPOT OF A SENATOR,

01:55:53.846 --> 01:55:54.681
BUT HERE I AM, BRENDAN TUIGG, ON

01:55:54.747 --> 01:55:56.149
BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AIR

01:55:56.215 --> 01:55:57.950
POLLUTION CONTROL OFFICERS

01:55:58.017 --> 01:55:59.686
ASSOCIATION, WHICH ARE THE AIR

01:55:59.752 --> 01:56:00.653
POLLUTION CONTROL OFFICERS FROM

01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:04.524
ALL 35 LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS. AND

01:56:04.590 --> 01:56:06.125
WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO

01:56:06.192 --> 01:56:08.494
THE AMENDED VERSION OF THE BILL.

01:56:08.561 --> 01:56:09.862
AIR DISTRICTS DON'T ADMINISTER

01:56:09.929 --> 01:56:11.331
THE SMOG CHECK PROGRAM, BUT

01:56:11.397 --> 01:56:13.066
WE'RE SUPPORTERS BECAUSE IT'S AN

01:56:13.132 --> 01:56:15.001
EQUITABLE WAY OF ACHIEVING

01:56:15.068 --> 01:56:17.403
EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS ESSENTIAL

01:56:17.470 --> 01:56:20.406
TO MEETING FEDERAL HEALTH BASED

01:56:20.473 --> 01:56:21.207
ATTAINMENT STANDARDS. AND WHILE

01:56:21.274 --> 01:56:23.609
WE APPRECIATE CALIFORNIA'S RICH

01:56:23.676 --> 01:56:26.079
AUTOMOTIVE HISTORY AND HERITAGE,

01:56:26.145 --> 01:56:27.547
UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL WILL

01:56:27.613 --> 01:56:28.948
SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE AIR

01:56:29.015 --> 01:56:31.217
POLLUTION AND HARM PUBLIC

01:56:31.284 --> 01:56:33.319
HEALTH. SO WHETHER A CAR IS A

01:56:33.386 --> 01:56:35.221
COLLECTOR IS LARGELY SELF

01:56:35.288 --> 01:56:37.323
DEFINED, AND THIS BILL ALLOWS

01:56:37.390 --> 01:56:38.858
TEN YEARS OF CARS AN EXEMPTION

01:56:38.925 --> 01:56:40.593
FROM THE SMOG CHECK PROGRAM, AS

01:56:40.660 --> 01:56:42.895
LONG AS THE OWNER HAS COLLECTOR

01:56:42.962 --> 01:56:44.897
CAR INSURANCE AND ALSO SELF

01:56:44.964 --> 01:56:48.434
CERTIFIES TO THE DMV THAT IT IS

01:56:48.501 --> 01:56:49.936
A HISTORIC VEHICLE AND THEY GET

01:56:50.002 --> 01:56:52.438
THE SPECIALTY PLATE. SO THE

01:56:52.505 --> 01:56:54.140
NUMBERS OF VEHICLES EXEMPTED

01:56:54.207 --> 01:56:57.110
COULD BE SIGNIFICANT. HAGERTY,

01:56:57.176 --> 01:56:59.145
WHICH IS ONE OF THE LARGE

01:56:59.212 --> 01:57:00.780
INSURERS OF COLLECTOR CAR

01:57:00.847 --> 01:57:02.849
INSURANCE, SAYS THAT THERE ARE

01:57:02.915 --> 01:57:04.283
43 MILLION CARS IN THE UNITED

01:57:04.350 --> 01:57:06.052
STATES THAT MEET THEIR CRITERIA

01:57:06.119 --> 01:57:10.056
OF A COLLECTOR. AND IN FACT, THE

01:57:10.123 --> 01:57:11.424
COLLECTOR CAR INSURANCE WE SEE

01:57:11.491 --> 01:57:14.260
WITH THAT, THERE'S VERY LITTLE

01:57:14.327 --> 01:57:15.161
ACCOUNTABILITY. THE

01:57:15.228 --> 01:57:16.195
ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM HERE IS

01:57:16.262 --> 01:57:18.765
THE SMOG CHECK PROGRAM. AND ALSO

01:57:18.831 --> 01:57:20.433
THE MILEAGE RESTRICTIONS, LIKE

01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:22.702
FOR HAGERTY, ARE 7500 MILES A

01:57:22.769 --> 01:57:26.172
YEAR. SO THAT'S RELATIVELY HIGH.

01:57:26.239 --> 01:57:28.141
AND I WOULD POINT OUT THAT UNDER

01:57:28.207 --> 01:57:30.343
THE SMOG CHECK PROGRAM, CARS

01:57:30.410 --> 01:57:31.911
DON'T HAVE TO MEET THE SAME

01:57:31.978 --> 01:57:33.513
EMISSION STANDARDS AS WHEN THEY

01:57:33.579 --> 01:57:36.249
WERE NEW OR OR EVEN THE SAME

01:57:36.315 --> 01:57:39.285
STANDARDS, OR TODAY'S NEW CARS,

01:57:39.352 --> 01:57:41.721
OR EVEN WHEN THEY WERE NEW,

01:57:41.788 --> 01:57:43.556
BECAUSE THAT'S BECAUSE THE

01:57:43.623 --> 01:57:44.891
PROGRAM TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION

01:57:44.957 --> 01:57:46.726
THE EXPECTED DETERIORATION OF

01:57:46.793 --> 01:57:53.166
THE EMISSIONS CONTROL EQUIPMENT.

01:57:53.232 --> 01:57:55.268
CARB DATA SHOWS US THAT 1982

01:57:55.334 --> 01:57:55.902
PASSENGER VEHICLE THAT PASSES

01:57:55.968 --> 01:57:56.869
ACTUALLY PASSES. THE SMOG CHECK

01:57:56.936 --> 01:58:00.740
PROGRAM EMITS 123 TIMES THE NOX

01:58:00.807 --> 01:58:03.342
EMISSIONS OF A 2025 CAR. AND SO

01:58:03.409 --> 01:58:06.345
IF YOU PLAY THAT OUT AND YOU

01:58:06.412 --> 01:58:08.181
LOOK AT THE LIKE OPERATING UNDER

01:58:08.247 --> 01:58:09.615
THE MILEAGE LIMITS FOR HAGERTY

01:58:09.682 --> 01:58:11.651
AT 7500 MILES THAT YOU WRAP UP,

01:58:11.717 --> 01:58:15.254
YES, THAT'S 922,500 MILES. SO I

01:58:15.321 --> 01:58:16.289
WILL JUST SAY IT'S IMPORTANT

01:58:16.355 --> 01:58:17.657
THAT CARS GO TO SMOG BECAUSE

01:58:17.723 --> 01:58:19.091
OTHERWISE THE EQUIPMENT CAN BE

01:58:19.158 --> 01:58:20.893
TAMPERED WITH. AND AT A TIME

01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:23.196
WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS

01:58:23.262 --> 01:58:26.732
ROLLING BACK ON ON CLEAN AIR,

01:58:26.799 --> 01:58:28.201
NOW IS NOT THE TIME, I THINK, TO

01:58:28.267 --> 01:58:30.336
IMPOSE A SELF SOMETHING

01:58:30.403 --> 01:58:31.804
SELF-INFLICTED. THANK YOU, MADAM

DO NOT HAVE A QUORUM. BUT SO WE

02:01:56.976 --> 02:01:58.310
ARE OPERATING AS A SUBCOMMITTEE.

02:01:58.377 --> 02:02:00.012
I WANTED TO GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY

02:02:00.079 --> 02:02:02.014
FOR MEMBERS OF OUR COMMITTEE TO

02:02:02.081 --> 02:02:03.482

SENATOR, FOR BRINGING THE BILL

02:02:15.027 --> 02:02:18.898

02:02:18.964 --> 02:02:20.766
SAN DIEGO AREA AND ORANGE

02:02:20.833 --> 02:02:23.502
COUNTY, THIS IS TO ME ONE OF THE

02:02:23.569 --> 02:02:24.670
INCREDIBLE THINGS WITH CLASSIC

02:02:24.737 --> 02:02:26.739
CARS IS IT BRINGS FAMILIES

02:02:26.806 --> 02:02:27.873
TOGETHER. THERE ISN'T A WEEKEND

02:02:27.940 --> 02:02:30.109
THAT DOESN'T GO BY THAT WE DON'T

02:02:30.176 --> 02:02:32.912
HAVE SOME TYPE OF EVENT WHERE

02:02:32.978 --> 02:02:34.013
GENERATIONS ARE LEARNING THE

02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:36.115
BEAUTY AND ENJOYING THIS. AND I

02:02:36.182 --> 02:02:38.417
ALSO JUST WANT TO MAKE A POINT

02:02:38.484 --> 02:02:40.486
THAT THESE ARE A LOT OF TIMES

02:02:40.553 --> 02:02:41.787
JUST RECREATIONAL CARS. THEY'RE

02:02:41.854 --> 02:02:44.156
NOT DRIVEN ON THE ROAD EVERY

02:02:44.223 --> 02:02:46.258
SINGLE DAY. IF YOU TAKE A LOOK

02:02:46.325 --> 02:02:48.160
AT THE YOU KNOW WHAT, WHAT KIND

02:02:48.227 --> 02:02:49.261
OF CONDITION THEY'RE IN, YOU

02:02:49.328 --> 02:02:50.963
KNOW THAT THEY COME OUT PERHAPS

02:02:51.030 --> 02:02:52.431
SOMETIMES THROUGH PARADES OR FOR

02:02:52.498 --> 02:02:54.233
AN EVENT. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE

02:02:54.300 --> 02:02:55.301
TIME, THEY'RE ACTUALLY DRIVING,

02:02:55.367 --> 02:02:57.870
COMPARED TO ALL OF US THAT ARE

02:02:57.937 --> 02:02:59.271
OUT THERE DRIVING OUR VEHICLES,

02:02:59.338 --> 02:03:01.774
THE EMISSIONS AREN'T IS, YOU

02:03:01.841 --> 02:03:04.243
KNOW, ARE NOT THAT HIGH. SO I

02:03:04.310 --> 02:03:07.913
LIKE THIS BILL AND I'D LIKE TO

02:03:07.980 --> 02:03:11.150
SUPPORT IT. THANK YOU LACKEY.

02:03:11.217 --> 02:03:13.219
I'M GOING TO HOLD MY TONGUE

02:03:13.285 --> 02:03:15.755
BECAUSE I THINK THE OPPOSITION

02:03:15.821 --> 02:03:19.425
IS VERY EXTREME. AND THEY'VE

02:03:19.492 --> 02:03:21.894
INDICATED THAT IF YOU'RE NOT

02:03:21.961 --> 02:03:23.362
ENVIRONMENTALLY PURE, YOU'RE

02:03:23.429 --> 02:03:24.764
UNACCEPTABLE. THAT'S REALLY WHAT

02:03:24.830 --> 02:03:27.199
IS BEING STATED HERE. BECAUSE

02:03:27.266 --> 02:03:29.034
AND WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE

02:03:29.101 --> 02:03:31.604
BENEFITS, WHAT THE ARGUMENT DOES

02:03:31.670 --> 02:03:34.106
NOT NEGATE THE BENEFITS THAT ARE

02:03:34.173 --> 02:03:35.641
ACHIEVED. THERE'S FINANCIAL

02:03:35.708 --> 02:03:38.644
BENEFITS. THERE'S RELATIONSHIP.

02:03:38.711 --> 02:03:40.713
I MEAN, WE SEE THE CULTURAL

02:03:40.780 --> 02:03:42.148
BENEFITS. THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF

02:03:42.214 --> 02:03:43.516
OTHER BENEFITS THAT JUST GET

02:03:43.582 --> 02:03:45.284
TOTALLY DISMISSED. I THINK

02:03:45.351 --> 02:03:47.820
THAT'S UNFAIR. AND I THINK

02:03:47.887 --> 02:03:49.989
YOU'RE TO BE COMMENDED FOR

02:03:50.055 --> 02:03:51.157
BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD

02:03:51.223 --> 02:03:53.526
BECAUSE IT'S REASONABLE. SO I

02:03:53.592 --> 02:03:56.095
APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR THOUGHT

02:03:56.162 --> 02:03:57.530
PROCESS. AND IF I'M NOT A

02:03:57.596 --> 02:04:00.065
COAUTHOR, I CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE

02:04:00.132 --> 02:04:04.303
TO BE. THANK YOU. OKAY. SEEING

02:04:04.370 --> 02:04:06.605
NO OTHER COMMENTS, I'LL NOTE I

02:04:06.672 --> 02:04:08.040
APPRECIATE ALL THE ROBUST

02:04:08.107 --> 02:04:09.141
CONVERSATION, AS THE SENATOR

02:04:09.208 --> 02:04:10.276
NOTED THAT WE HAD, ALONG WITH

02:04:10.342 --> 02:04:13.445
THE CHAIR, MY COUNTERPART IN THE

02:04:13.512 --> 02:04:15.114
SENATE, WE TALKED QUITE A BIT

02:04:15.181 --> 02:04:16.315
ABOUT THIS BILL AND TRYING TO

02:04:16.382 --> 02:04:17.750
STRIKE A BALANCE, RECOGNIZING

02:04:17.817 --> 02:04:20.586
THE IMPACT, POTENTIAL IMPACT TO

02:04:20.653 --> 02:04:23.489
THE AIR, AS WAS NOTED FROM

02:04:23.556 --> 02:04:25.291
OPPOSITION. AND GENERALLY WE DO

02:04:25.357 --> 02:04:29.328
HAVE TO FOCUS ON MAKING SURE WE

02:04:29.395 --> 02:04:31.664
HAVE CLEAN AIR FOR FOLKS. AND

02:04:31.730 --> 02:04:32.865
PART OF THAT IS THROUGH OUR SMOG

02:04:32.932 --> 02:04:34.934
PROGRAM, BUT ALSO RECOGNIZING

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.203
THAT THERE IS THIS SMALL NUMBER

02:04:37.269 --> 02:04:40.072
OF VEHICLES, TYPICALLY WHO

02:04:40.139 --> 02:04:41.574
SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE

02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:44.410
OF AN EXEMPTION LIKE A 1976 OR

02:04:44.476 --> 02:04:46.212
PRIOR. I THINK WE FOUND A GOOD

02:04:46.278 --> 02:04:47.079
BALANCE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT.

02:04:47.146 --> 02:04:49.415
WE ALSO SUNSETTED IT. SO THERE

02:04:49.481 --> 02:04:51.283
IS ANOTHER POINT FOR THE

02:04:51.350 --> 02:04:53.285
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER THE

02:04:53.352 --> 02:04:55.020
IMPACT, THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES

02:04:55.087 --> 02:04:57.690
THAT ACTUALLY APPLIED TO AND

02:04:57.756 --> 02:04:59.191
WHETHER IT'S SOMETHING TO

02:04:59.258 --> 02:05:00.860
CONTINUE OR WHAT ELSE CAN BE

02:05:00.926 --> 02:05:02.928
DONE. AND SO THAT WAS IMPORTANT

02:05:02.995 --> 02:05:05.231
TO ME. AND SO WITH THAT, AT THE

02:05:05.297 --> 02:05:06.632
APPROPRIATE TIME, I WILL BE

02:05:06.699 --> 02:05:09.168
SUPPORTING THE BILL AND LOOK

02:05:09.235 --> 02:05:11.437
FORWARD TO THE CONTINUED

02:05:11.503 --> 02:05:13.038
DISCUSSION ON THIS. AND WE MIGHT

02:05:13.105 --> 02:05:16.008
JUST HAVE A QUORUM. SO HOLD ON

02:05:16.075 --> 02:05:21.747
ONE SECOND. HERE WE DO. YES.

02:05:21.814 --> 02:05:23.816
OKAY. WE DO HAVE A QUORUM. SO IF

02:05:23.883 --> 02:05:25.517
YOU WANT TO WAIT, WE CAN TAKE

02:05:25.584 --> 02:05:26.518
ACTION ON YOUR BILL. ONCE WE

02:05:26.585 --> 02:05:27.887
ESTABLISH THAT QUORUM WHILE

02:05:27.953 --> 02:05:29.321
WE'RE GETTING THINGS SETTLED,

02:05:29.388 --> 02:05:31.657
I'D LIKE TO NOTE WE DO HAVE A

02:05:31.724 --> 02:05:32.958
WITNESS THAT HAS TO LEAVE AND

02:05:33.025 --> 02:05:34.827
CATCH A FLIGHT. SO ONCE WE

02:05:34.894 --> 02:05:36.128
DISPENSE WITH THIS BILL, WE'RE

02:05:36.195 --> 02:05:40.499
GOING TO MOVE TO ITEM FILE, ITEM

02:05:40.566 --> 02:05:44.370
NUMBER 16, SB 800 REYES, WHICH

02:05:44.436 --> 02:05:46.939
WILL BE PRESENTED BY SENATOR

02:05:47.006 --> 02:05:49.208
RICHARDSON. AND THEN ONCE THAT

02:05:49.275 --> 02:05:50.409
BILL IS DISPENSED WITH, WE'LL GO

02:05:50.476 --> 02:05:53.112
BACK TO FILE ITEM ORDER. WITH

02:05:53.178 --> 02:05:54.413

02:06:17.937 --> 02:06:22.274
WE ARE SAYING THAT WE ARE HERE.

ASK FOR A MOTION, I WANTED TO

02:06:59.311 --> 02:07:01.747
MAKE SURE THAT NO MEMBERS WHO

02:07:01.814 --> 02:07:02.381
JUST ARRIVED WANTED TO COMMENT

I'LL GIVE IT TO THE AUTHOR.

WOULD YOU LIKE TO EITHER AUTHOR?

02:07:18.330 --> 02:07:23.002
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE? YES, I

02:07:23.068 --> 02:07:25.871
SEE EITHER AUTHOR. I DO WANT TO.

02:07:25.938 --> 02:07:27.139
I DO WANT TO DEFER TO SENATOR

02:07:27.206 --> 02:07:28.707
GROVE IN A MOMENT HERE, BECAUSE,

02:07:28.774 --> 02:07:30.542
YOU KNOW, THIS BILL WAS A

02:07:30.609 --> 02:07:32.611
BIPARTISAN BILL FROM THE MOMENT

02:07:32.678 --> 02:07:36.348
SHE STARTED TO TALK TO PEOPLE

02:07:36.415 --> 02:07:37.683
ACTUALLY ON THE FLOOR, WHICH IS

02:07:37.750 --> 02:07:40.686
SENATOR GROVE'S OFTENTIMES HER

02:07:40.753 --> 02:07:43.922
HER WAY OF GETTING TO THE POINT

02:07:43.989 --> 02:07:45.758
OF CONSENSUS ON THINGS LIKE

02:07:45.824 --> 02:07:48.227
THIS. AND I WAS AN EARLY

02:07:48.293 --> 02:07:49.428
SUPPORTER OF THIS BILL, NOT JUST

02:07:49.495 --> 02:07:50.729
AS SENATE TRANSPORTATION CHAIR,

02:07:50.796 --> 02:07:52.664
AS AS WERE SEVERAL OTHER MEMBERS

02:07:52.731 --> 02:07:54.433
OF THE SENATE ON BOTH SIDES OF

02:07:54.500 --> 02:07:56.035
THE AISLE. AND I THINK IT'S

02:07:56.101 --> 02:07:57.169
BECAUSE THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS

02:07:57.236 --> 02:07:58.404
AMOUNT OF FAITH FROM THE

02:07:58.470 --> 02:08:02.641
BEGINNING THAT THIS ISSUE, WHICH

02:08:02.708 --> 02:08:05.110
IS TO SOME DEGREE A SERIES OF

02:08:05.177 --> 02:08:07.946
NUANCED ISSUES AROUND WHAT

02:08:08.013 --> 02:08:10.449
HAPPENS WITH 76 IN NEWER

02:08:10.516 --> 02:08:12.084
VEHICLES THAT JUST CAN'T, THAT

02:08:12.151 --> 02:08:13.585
ARE JUST WHERE PEOPLE ARE JUST

02:08:13.652 --> 02:08:15.821
STUCK BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD

02:08:15.888 --> 02:08:17.656
PLACE IN TERMS OF EVEN ACHIEVING

02:08:17.723 --> 02:08:21.293
A SMOG TEST OR SMOG CHECK OR THE

02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:22.161
ACTUAL CERTIFICATE. YOU KNOW, I

02:08:22.227 --> 02:08:24.496
THINK THERE WAS A FEELING RIGHT

02:08:24.563 --> 02:08:25.564
THROUGH COMMITTEE, RIGHT THROUGH

02:08:25.631 --> 02:08:28.067
A VERY STRONG FOUR VOTE IN THE

02:08:28.133 --> 02:08:31.003
SENATE THAT THAT THIS BILL WOULD

02:08:31.070 --> 02:08:33.138
PROGRESS TO THE POINT OF

02:08:33.205 --> 02:08:34.807
REACHING THAT EQUILIBRIUM, MADAM

02:08:34.873 --> 02:08:36.041
CHAIR, THAT YOU WERE JUST

02:08:36.108 --> 02:08:37.976
TALKING ABOUT. AND AGAIN, I JUST

02:08:38.043 --> 02:08:38.977
WANT TO THANK YOU AND THANK THE

02:08:39.044 --> 02:08:40.412
COMMITTEE STAFF FOR STICKING

02:08:40.479 --> 02:08:42.681
WITH IT. IT'S A TOUGH BILL. IT

02:08:42.748 --> 02:08:44.516
WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A TRICKY

02:08:44.583 --> 02:08:46.251
BILL TO THREAD THE NEEDLE, AS WE

02:08:46.318 --> 02:08:47.619
SAY SOMETIMES. AND I THINK

02:08:47.686 --> 02:08:50.823
THAT'S BEEN DONE HERE. AND I

02:08:50.889 --> 02:08:51.423
WOULD RESPECTFULLY URGE THAT I

02:08:51.490 --> 02:08:53.926
VOTE. THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU,

02:08:53.992 --> 02:08:55.194
MADAM CHAIR. AND AGAIN, THANK

02:08:55.260 --> 02:08:57.362
YOU AGAIN FOR WORKING WITH ME ON

02:08:57.429 --> 02:08:59.898
THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. LIKE I

02:08:59.965 --> 02:09:01.200
SAID, WE IN MY COMMENTS THAT WE

02:09:01.266 --> 02:09:03.602
WENT FOR A 35 YEAR ROLLOVER TO

02:09:03.669 --> 02:09:05.170
COVER THAT ENTIRE GAP OF CARS

02:09:05.237 --> 02:09:06.538
THAT WERE COVERED, BUT MOVING

02:09:06.605 --> 02:09:09.108
THE BILL FORWARD WITH A TEN YEAR

02:09:09.174 --> 02:09:10.275
EXTENSION ON THIS WITH, YOU

02:09:10.342 --> 02:09:12.077
KNOW, FIVE YEARS IN AN

02:09:12.144 --> 02:09:13.912
INCREMENTALLY, BUT FIVE YEARS IN

02:09:13.979 --> 02:09:15.380
ADDITIONAL IMMEDIATELY IS REALLY

02:09:15.447 --> 02:09:17.549
A COMPROMISE THAT I THINK IS

02:09:17.616 --> 02:09:19.284
GOOD FOR CAR ENTHUSIAST AND

02:09:19.351 --> 02:09:20.786
THOSE THAT ARE EXPLORING

02:09:20.853 --> 02:09:22.821
CULTURAL HISTORY. AND I DO THINK

02:09:22.888 --> 02:09:25.724
THAT EVEN WITH THE OPPOSITION,

02:09:25.791 --> 02:09:27.559
WE DID ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. I

02:09:27.626 --> 02:09:29.228
WORKED VERY WELL WITH THE CHAIR,

02:09:29.294 --> 02:09:31.163
WHO IS A CAR ENTHUSIAST HIMSELF.

02:09:31.230 --> 02:09:33.465
WE DID AN EFFECT VEHICLE CODE

02:09:33.532 --> 02:09:34.566
279, WHICH ALREADY OUTLINES THAT

02:09:34.633 --> 02:09:36.602
A COLLECTOR VEHICLE IS, QUOTE, A

02:09:36.668 --> 02:09:37.636
COLLECTOR VEHICLE, MEANING THE

02:09:37.703 --> 02:09:39.238
VEHICLE OWNED BY A COLLECTOR IS

02:09:39.304 --> 02:09:41.940
DEFINED BY SUBDIVISION A, A

02:09:42.007 --> 02:09:44.243
SECTION 5051, AND THE MOTOR

02:09:44.309 --> 02:09:45.377
VEHICLE CODE IS USED. THE MOTOR

02:09:45.444 --> 02:09:46.411
VEHICLE IS PRIMARILY USED FOR

02:09:46.478 --> 02:09:47.779
SHOWS, SHOWS, PARADES,

02:09:47.846 --> 02:09:48.747
CHARITABLE FUNCTIONS, AND

02:09:48.814 --> 02:09:50.582
HISTORICAL EXHIBITIONS ON

02:09:50.649 --> 02:09:53.118
DISPLAY, MAINTENANCE AND

02:09:53.185 --> 02:09:54.319
PRESERVATION, AND IS NOT USED

02:09:54.386 --> 02:09:56.355
FOR PRIMARY TRANSPORTATION AND

02:09:56.421 --> 02:09:59.958
AGAIN ON THE ISSUE ON THE CARBON

02:10:00.025 --> 02:10:02.494
AND NOX OR THE NOX EMISSIONS. IT

02:10:02.561 --> 02:10:04.596
IS TRUE THAT OLDER CARS HAD A

02:10:04.663 --> 02:10:06.865
HIGHER NOX EMISSIONS, BUT THE

02:10:06.932 --> 02:10:08.066
NUMBERS THAT WERE THROWN OUT AND

02:10:08.133 --> 02:10:10.002
THE NUMBERS IN THE ANALYSIS JUST

02:10:10.068 --> 02:10:11.436
TO POINT OUT IT WOULD BE

02:10:11.503 --> 02:10:12.171
EQUIVALENT TO DRIVING ONE OF

02:10:12.237 --> 02:10:15.374
THESE OLD CARS 369,000 MILES A

02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:17.276
YEAR AND OR TOTAL. AND THEY'RE

02:10:17.342 --> 02:10:19.044
NOT GOING TO DO THAT. THESE CARS

02:10:19.111 --> 02:10:21.547
ARE INCREDIBLY RESTORED, AND

02:10:21.613 --> 02:10:23.815
THEY'RE A WORK OF ART. AND I

02:10:23.882 --> 02:10:25.150
JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE

02:10:25.217 --> 02:10:26.385

DISTRICT BILL THAT REQUIRES

02:13:13.352 --> 02:13:15.087
CALTRANS IN CONSULTATION WITH

02:13:15.153 --> 02:13:17.222

MITIGATION MEASURES TO HELP

PREVENT SUICIDES ON LOCALLY

02:13:23.428 --> 02:13:25.931
OWNED OVERPASSES THAT CROSS OVER

02:13:25.997 --> 02:13:27.933
STATE HIGHWAYS. WHILE ANY

02:13:27.999 --> 02:13:29.801
SUICIDE ATTEMPT IS A CAUSE FOR

02:13:29.868 --> 02:13:32.304
ALARM, THERE WAS AN ESPECIALLY

02:13:32.371 --> 02:13:34.306
HEARTBREAKING SCENARIO IN

02:13:34.373 --> 02:13:36.208
SENATOR REYES DISTRICT LAST YEAR

02:13:36.274 --> 02:13:38.610
WHERE HER COMMUNITY LOST TWO

02:13:38.677 --> 02:13:40.579
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AT THE SAME

02:13:40.645 --> 02:13:42.848
TIME, SAME LOCATION WITHIN A

02:13:42.914 --> 02:13:45.817
WEEK AND A HALF OF EACH OTHER. I

02:13:45.884 --> 02:13:47.185
WOULD, YOU KNOW, MY RESPECT FOR

02:13:47.252 --> 02:13:48.820
SENATOR REYES IS VERY HIGH.

02:13:48.887 --> 02:13:50.655
HOWEVER, ONLY ONE THING I WOULD

02:13:50.722 --> 02:13:51.356
CHALLENGE HER AND SAY, THIS

02:13:51.423 --> 02:13:53.158
REALLY ISN'T A DISTRICT BILL.

02:13:53.225 --> 02:13:56.128
IT'S A STATE BILL. WHEN I WAS IN

02:13:56.194 --> 02:13:57.596
HIGH SCHOOL, I HAD A FRIEND OF

02:13:57.662 --> 02:13:59.364
MINE. HER NAME WAS GABRIELLE

02:13:59.431 --> 02:14:01.133
WONG, AND SHE ALWAYS GOT

02:14:01.199 --> 02:14:02.567
STRAIGHT A'S AND I GOT STRAIGHT

02:14:02.634 --> 02:14:04.870
B'S. I GOT B'S BECAUSE MY MOM

02:14:04.936 --> 02:14:07.005
SAID I HAD TO HAVE AT LEAST A B

02:14:07.072 --> 02:14:09.007
AVERAGE TO PLAY SPORTS. SO I GOT

02:14:09.074 --> 02:14:10.475
B'S, BUT GABRIELLE ALWAYS GOT

02:14:10.542 --> 02:14:13.078
A'S. AND SHE WENT TO UCLA HER

02:14:13.145 --> 02:14:14.579
FRESHMAN YEAR, AND FOR THE FIRST

02:14:14.646 --> 02:14:17.082
TIME IN HER LIFE, SHE GOT A C ON

02:14:17.149 --> 02:14:18.583
A MIDTERM. AND HOW DID SHE

02:14:18.650 --> 02:14:20.852
RESPOND? SHE DROPPED SHE

02:14:20.919 --> 02:14:23.455
ACTUALLY CLIMBED OVER AND, YOU

02:14:23.522 --> 02:14:25.290
KNOW, WENT TO UNFORTUNATELY HER

02:14:25.357 --> 02:14:27.793
DEATH ON THE 110 FREEWAY. YOUNG

02:14:27.859 --> 02:14:30.295
PEOPLE OFTENTIMES UNFORTUNATELY

02:14:30.362 --> 02:14:32.497
SEE THIS AS WHEN THERE SEEMS NOT

02:14:32.564 --> 02:14:34.433
TO BE HOPE, NOT UNDERSTANDING

02:14:34.499 --> 02:14:36.101
THE VERY SEVERITY AND THE HARM

02:14:36.168 --> 02:14:38.937
THAT THIS WILL CAUSE. SINCE

02:14:39.004 --> 02:14:40.739
SENATOR REYES AND HER DISTRICT,

02:14:40.806 --> 02:14:42.974
LIKE MINE, HAD THESE LOSSES,

02:14:43.041 --> 02:14:44.843
THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER ATTEMPTS

02:14:44.910 --> 02:14:46.778
ON SIMILAR OVERPASSES WHICH

02:14:46.845 --> 02:14:49.080
SPEAK TO THE NECESSITY FOR THE

02:14:49.147 --> 02:14:50.849
STATE TO PROPERLY PLAN

02:14:50.916 --> 02:14:52.384
MITIGATION MEASURES, AS THESE

02:14:52.451 --> 02:14:55.520
ARE NOT ISOLATED INCIDENCES.

02:14:55.587 --> 02:14:57.989
ADDRESSING SUICIDE IS INHERENTLY

02:14:58.056 --> 02:14:59.758
COMPLICATED, AND THERE IS NO

02:14:59.825 --> 02:15:01.259
SINGLE ANSWER TO HOW TO PREVENT

02:15:01.326 --> 02:15:03.728
THESE TRAGEDIES TRAGEDIES.

02:15:03.795 --> 02:15:05.964
HOWEVER, HAVING THIS IMPORTANT

02:15:06.031 --> 02:15:07.399
INFRASTRUCTURE IS A CRITICAL

02:15:07.466 --> 02:15:09.234
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

02:15:09.301 --> 02:15:11.269
SENATOR REYES AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER

02:15:11.336 --> 02:15:13.805

WORKING WITH THEM TO SEE THIS

02:15:19.311 --> 02:15:24.816
ISSUE RESOLVED. NO FAMILY, NO

02:15:24.883 --> 02:15:26.518
SCHOOL, NO COMMUNITY SHOULD HAVE

02:15:26.585 --> 02:15:27.486
TO ENDURE SUCH UNIMAGINABLE

02:15:27.552 --> 02:15:29.020
GRIEF. HERE TO TESTIFY IN

02:15:29.087 --> 02:15:31.923

FOR GIVING ME AN OPPORTUNITY

02:15:42.701 --> 02:15:44.769
TODAY TO SPEAK ON THIS VERY

02:15:44.836 --> 02:15:46.972
IMPORTANT ISSUE. AS WAS

02:15:47.038 --> 02:15:49.508
MENTIONED, THIS BILL HAS SHIFTED

02:15:49.574 --> 02:15:52.077
SLIGHTLY AWAY FROM ITS ORIGINAL

02:15:52.143 --> 02:15:54.112
INTENT. WE SINCERELY THANK

02:15:54.179 --> 02:15:56.648
SENATOR RICHARDSON, AS WELL AS

THIS COMMITTEE, FOR KEEPING THIS

02:16:01.453 --> 02:16:04.890
ISSUE VISIBLE. THE CONTINUED

02:16:04.956 --> 02:16:07.425
VISIBILITY IS DEEPLY IMPORTANT

02:16:07.492 --> 02:16:09.194
TO OUR COMMUNITY AND WAS

02:16:09.261 --> 02:16:11.429
MENTIONED BY THE SENATOR BY THIS

02:16:11.496 --> 02:16:14.933
ENTIRE STATE JUST LAST WEEK.

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:16.835
UNFORTUNATELY, WE EXPERIENCED

02:16:16.902 --> 02:16:19.771
ANOTHER SUICIDE ATTEMPT ON ONE

02:16:19.838 --> 02:16:23.608
OF OUR FREEWAY OVERPASSES. THESE

02:16:23.675 --> 02:16:26.878
INCIDENTS, AS MENTIONED, ARE NOT

02:16:26.945 --> 02:16:29.114
ISOLATED. THEY ARE ONGOING. THEY

02:16:29.180 --> 02:16:32.350
ARE DEVASTATING. BUT WHAT'S MOST

02:16:32.417 --> 02:16:34.419
IMPORTANT IS THEY ARE

02:16:34.486 --> 02:16:36.621
PREVENTABLE. WE UNDERSTAND THE

02:16:36.688 --> 02:16:40.225
COST CONSTRAINTS AND OPERATIONAL

02:16:40.292 --> 02:16:43.528
CHALLENGES CALTRANS FACES, BUT

02:16:43.595 --> 02:16:46.331
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

02:16:46.398 --> 02:16:50.235
PRICE AND COST. PRICE IS

02:16:50.302 --> 02:16:52.804
QUANTITATIVE. IT'S FIXED. THE

02:16:52.871 --> 02:16:56.408
COST IS QUALITATIVE, AND IT'S

02:16:56.474 --> 02:17:00.412
DEVASTATING. SB 800 IS A STEP IN

02:17:00.478 --> 02:17:02.814
THE RIGHT DIRECTION. IT'S A

02:17:02.881 --> 02:17:07.218
VEHICLE FOR CONVERSATION, A TOOL

02:17:07.285 --> 02:17:09.421
FOR IDENTIFYING HIGH RISK

02:17:09.487 --> 02:17:12.958

BUT FOR THIS STUDY TO BE

02:17:19.130 --> 02:17:22.033
MEANINGFUL, IT MUST DRIVE

02:17:22.100 --> 02:17:25.136
ACTION. IDENTIFYING OVERPASSES

02:17:25.203 --> 02:17:29.207
WITH A HISTORY OF SUICIDE OR

02:17:29.274 --> 02:17:31.676
SUICIDE ATTEMPTS, DETERMINING

02:17:31.743 --> 02:17:34.646
WHERE STRUCTURAL SAFETY

02:17:34.713 --> 02:17:37.148
INTERVENTIONS ARE MOST URGENTLY,

02:17:37.215 --> 02:17:39.250
URGENTLY NEEDED, AND ENSURING

02:17:39.317 --> 02:17:42.187
THAT THOSE IMPROVEMENTS ARE

02:17:42.253 --> 02:17:43.655
IMPLEMENTED. THIS ISN'T JUST

02:17:43.722 --> 02:17:45.757
ABOUT DATA COLLECTION, IT'S

02:17:45.824 --> 02:17:48.226
ABOUT PREVENTION. IT'S ABOUT

02:17:48.293 --> 02:17:52.330
PUTTING SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE TO

02:17:52.397 --> 02:17:54.799

THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS.

02:19:53.718 --> 02:19:56.154
MOTION MADE BY Kò. YEAH. I JUST

02:19:56.221 --> 02:20:01.393
WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR

02:20:01.459 --> 02:20:02.093
ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE AND

02:20:02.160 --> 02:20:04.028
SOMEWHAT OF A MEANINGFUL WAY. I

02:20:04.095 --> 02:20:06.131
DON'T THINK ANYBODY CAN MATCH

02:20:06.197 --> 02:20:07.899
THE HORRENDOUS EXPERIENCE I'VE

02:20:07.966 --> 02:20:12.937
HAD RELATING TO THIS ISSUE, AND

02:20:13.004 --> 02:20:14.072
I'VE RESPONDED TO MULTIPLE

02:20:14.139 --> 02:20:15.573
INCIDENTS WHERE THIS HAS TAKEN

02:20:15.640 --> 02:20:16.474
PLACE. AS A HIGHWAY PATROL

02:20:16.541 --> 02:20:19.244
MEMBER, AND I WITNESSED ONE, AND

02:20:19.310 --> 02:20:23.782
IT'S A MEMORY THAT PRETTY NASTY.

02:20:23.848 --> 02:20:25.283
AND IT HAPPENED DURING THE

02:20:25.350 --> 02:20:27.018
HOLIDAY PERIOD, AND IT WAS A

02:20:27.085 --> 02:20:29.220
PERSON IN THEIR YOUNG 20S. AND

02:20:29.287 --> 02:20:30.622
EVERY CHRISTMAS SEASON I'M

02:20:30.688 --> 02:20:33.224
REMINDED OF THIS. AND SO IF WE

02:20:33.291 --> 02:20:36.127
COULD DO ANYTHING TO PREVENT

02:20:36.194 --> 02:20:38.730
SUCH A MALADY, I IT'S WORTH

02:20:38.797 --> 02:20:42.667

02:20:42.734 --> 02:20:45.069

MADE? SECOND? SECOND BY JACKSON

02:20:47.205 --> 02:20:48.973

02:20:49.040 --> 02:20:50.842
JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU SO

02:20:50.909 --> 02:20:52.644
MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD.

02:20:52.710 --> 02:20:54.646
AND I'D LIKE TO BE CONSIDERED

02:20:54.712 --> 02:21:00.919
FOR A COAUTHOR. ALL RIGHT.

02:21:00.985 --> 02:21:04.122
SEEING NO FURTHER, YOU KNOW,

02:21:04.189 --> 02:21:05.190
STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT

02:21:05.256 --> 02:21:06.324
RESTRICTING ACCESS TO LETHAL

02:21:06.391 --> 02:21:08.092
MEANS, SUCH AS HIGH PLACES LIKE

02:21:08.159 --> 02:21:10.762
BRIDGES, IS A CRITICAL STRATEGY

02:21:10.829 --> 02:21:12.463
FOR SUICIDE PREVENTION. AND

02:21:12.530 --> 02:21:13.865
SUICIDAL CRISISES ARE OFTEN

02:21:13.932 --> 02:21:16.067
BRIEF, WITH THE TIME BETWEEN

02:21:16.134 --> 02:21:17.402
THOUGHT AND ACTION SOMETIME

02:21:17.468 --> 02:21:19.604
LASTING ONLY MINUTES. AND SO

02:21:19.671 --> 02:21:21.472
IMPLEMENTING SAFETY MEASURES

02:21:21.539 --> 02:21:23.274
INTRODUCE A CRUCIAL PAUSE,

02:21:23.341 --> 02:21:24.609
OFFERING TIME FOR INTERVENTION,

02:21:24.676 --> 02:21:27.579
AND THIS STUDY WILL HELP TO

02:21:27.645 --> 02:21:29.314
IDENTIFY APPROPRIATE SUICIDE

02:21:29.380 --> 02:21:31.182
DETERRENT MEASURES FOR LOCALLY

02:21:31.249 --> 02:21:33.051
OWNED OVERPASSES OVER STATE

02:21:33.117 --> 02:21:34.719
HIGHWAYS IN THE STATE'S RIGHT OF

ENTITIES FROM SELLING, DONATING

02:24:05.269 --> 02:24:07.305
OR TRANSFERRING DECOMMISSIONED

02:24:07.372 --> 02:24:09.140
DIESEL LOCOMOTIVES, MEANING

02:24:09.207 --> 02:24:11.242
ALREADY DECOMMISSIONED DIESEL

OLDER ENGINE UNLESS THE ENGINE

02:24:16.047 --> 02:24:18.549
IS REMOVED. THESE ARE THE OLDEST

02:24:18.616 --> 02:24:19.784
AND MOST POLLUTING ENGINES. THIS

02:24:19.851 --> 02:24:21.452
BILL PERMITS THE SALE OR

02:24:21.519 --> 02:24:23.187

VOTING AT A PUBLIC HEARING. THE

DEVASTATING HEALTH IMPACTS OF

02:24:29.827 --> 02:24:31.429
DIESEL POLLUTION CANNOT BE

02:24:31.496 --> 02:24:32.930
OVERSTATED. THE INTERNATIONAL

AGENCY FOR RESEARCH ON CANCER

02:24:34.098 --> 02:24:35.700
HAS CLASSIFIED DIESEL EMISSIONS

02:24:35.767 --> 02:24:37.702
AS CARCINOGENIC. THIS IS BECAUSE

02:24:37.769 --> 02:24:39.370
THEY CONTAIN MORE THAN 40

02:24:39.437 --> 02:24:40.505
CHEMICALS KNOWN TO CAUSE CANCER,

02:24:40.571 --> 02:24:42.306
INCLUDING BENZENE, ARSENIC,

02:24:42.373 --> 02:24:44.008
FORMALDEHYDE AND LEAD. EXPOSURE

02:24:44.075 --> 02:24:45.643
TO THESE CHEMICALS CAN LEAD TO

02:24:45.710 --> 02:24:47.345
INCREASED HOSPITALIZATIONS,

02:24:47.412 --> 02:24:49.047
WORSENING HEALTH CONDITIONS, AND

02:24:49.113 --> 02:24:51.282
PREMATURE MORTALITY. THESE

02:24:51.349 --> 02:24:52.850
CHEMICALS MAKE DIESEL EXHAUST

02:24:52.917 --> 02:24:54.252
MORE DAMAGING TO HUMAN HEALTH

02:24:54.318 --> 02:24:56.621
THAN GASOLINE VEHICLE EMISSIONS.

02:24:56.687 --> 02:24:58.156

115,000 DEATHS CAUSED BY

GASOLINE EMISSIONS, AND AN EVEN

02:25:03.528 --> 02:25:06.064
GREATER 122,000 DEATHS CAUSED BY

02:25:06.130 --> 02:25:08.499
DIESEL EMISSIONS. THESE DIESEL

02:25:08.566 --> 02:25:09.801
RELATED DEATHS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED

02:25:09.867 --> 02:25:11.769
MAINLY TO SOOT AND SMOKE

02:25:11.836 --> 02:25:13.237
EXPOSURE. ACCORDING TO THE

02:25:13.304 --> 02:25:15.073
CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD,

02:25:15.139 --> 02:25:16.808
DIESEL PARTICULATE MATTER CAN

02:25:16.874 --> 02:25:18.609
TRAVEL HUNDREDS OF MILES ONCE

02:25:18.676 --> 02:25:20.411
EMITTED. THIS MEANS IT CAN

02:25:20.478 --> 02:25:21.879
INFLUENCE AIR QUALITY FAR FROM

02:25:21.946 --> 02:25:24.015
THE SOURCE OF POLLUTION,

02:25:24.082 --> 02:25:25.850
INCLUDING IN CALIFORNIA.

02:25:25.917 --> 02:25:28.553
CALTRAIN RECENTLY AGREED TO SEND

02:25:28.619 --> 02:25:31.923
ITS RETIRED FLEET OF 90 CARS AND

02:25:31.989 --> 02:25:34.826
19 TIER ZERO DIESEL LOCOMOTIVES

02:25:34.892 --> 02:25:36.694
TO PERU, TIER ZERO BEING THE

02:25:36.761 --> 02:25:39.497
DIRTIEST OF LOCOMOTIVES. TIER

02:25:39.564 --> 02:25:40.965
ZERO ENGINES WERE MANUFACTURED

02:25:41.032 --> 02:25:44.268
BEFORE 2002 AND DO NOT HAVE TO

02:25:44.335 --> 02:25:47.004
MEET EPA EMISSION STANDARDS.

02:25:47.071 --> 02:25:48.606
CALTRAIN POINTS TO A US STATE

02:25:48.673 --> 02:25:49.540
DEPARTMENT ANALYSIS THAT

02:25:49.607 --> 02:25:50.875
PROJECTS EMISSION REDUCTIONS

02:25:50.942 --> 02:25:52.977
FROM THIS TRANSFER, BUT THESE

02:25:53.044 --> 02:25:55.012
TIER ZERO ENGINES WILL CONTINUE

02:25:55.079 --> 02:25:56.380
EMITTING HAZARDOUS PARTICULATE

02:25:56.447 --> 02:25:59.450
MATTER AND GHGS. IN PERU, THE

02:25:59.517 --> 02:26:03.988
COST TO ELECTRIFY THAT LINE WAS

02:26:04.055 --> 02:26:05.556
$2.5 BILLION. THE RETIRED TIER

02:26:05.623 --> 02:26:07.692
ZERO FLEET WAS SOLD FOR $6

02:26:07.759 --> 02:26:10.862
MILLION. THIS RECOVERED 0.24% OF

02:26:10.928 --> 02:26:14.432
THE COST, WAS ONE QUARTER OF 1%

02:26:14.499 --> 02:26:15.833
WORTH IT TO EXPOSE NEW

02:26:15.900 --> 02:26:17.301
COMMUNITIES TO HAZARDOUS

02:26:17.368 --> 02:26:19.504
POLLUTANTS. ONE OF THE SELLING

02:26:19.570 --> 02:26:23.107
POINTS OF THIS CHANGE IN THE BAY

02:26:23.174 --> 02:26:25.610
AREA WAS THAT CHILDREN WOULD NO

02:26:25.676 --> 02:26:27.745
LONGER BE EXPOSED TO DIESEL

02:26:27.812 --> 02:26:29.580
EMISSIONS ALONG THE CORRIDOR

02:26:29.647 --> 02:26:32.150
THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PUNCTUATED

02:26:32.216 --> 02:26:34.385
WITH A COMMA. THAT SAID, EXCEPT

02:26:34.452 --> 02:26:37.421
IN PERU, FROM THE PROJECT'S

02:26:37.488 --> 02:26:38.523
INCEPTION, CALTRAIN HAS BEEN

02:26:38.589 --> 02:26:39.891
HIGHLIGHTING THE GHG REDUCTIONS

02:26:39.957 --> 02:26:41.592
FROM GETTING RID OF THE OLD

02:26:41.659 --> 02:26:43.528
DIRTY TIER ZERO DIESEL ENGINES

02:26:43.594 --> 02:26:46.197
AND A 2016 NEWS RELEASE. IT

02:26:46.264 --> 02:26:47.198
PROJECTED THAT REGIONAL AIR

02:26:47.265 --> 02:26:49.066
QUALITY WOULD IMPROVE BY 97%,

02:26:49.133 --> 02:26:51.836
AND THAT IT WOULD REDUCE 176,000

02:26:51.903 --> 02:26:55.072
METRIC TONS OF CO2 EQUIVALENT BY

02:26:55.139 --> 02:26:57.408
2040. IF THE SWITCH FROM TIER

02:26:57.475 --> 02:26:58.709
ZERO TO FULLY ELECTRIC REDUCES

02:26:58.776 --> 02:27:01.312
AT LEAST 176,000 METRIC TONS OF

02:27:01.379 --> 02:27:03.781
CO2, HOW CAN WE THEN GO AND SEND

02:27:03.848 --> 02:27:06.284
THESE VERY SAME METRIC TONS OF

02:27:06.350 --> 02:27:09.453
CO2 SOMEWHERE ELSE? IN A 2022

02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:11.155

THE PROJECT, CALTRAIN STATED IT

02:27:14.292 --> 02:27:15.693
WOULD ELIMINATE THE PARTICULATE

02:27:15.760 --> 02:27:18.663
MATTER, QUOTE UNQUOTE, CAUSED BY

02:27:18.729 --> 02:27:21.065
THESE ENGINES. ELIMINATE. YET

02:27:21.132 --> 02:27:22.567
THE TRAINS WILL CONTINUE

02:27:22.633 --> 02:27:24.602
POLLUTING, THOUGH THE BILL

02:27:24.669 --> 02:27:26.237
ALLOWS FOR THE TRANSFER OF TIER

02:27:26.304 --> 02:27:28.272
TWO AND HIGHER ENGINES UNDER

02:27:28.339 --> 02:27:28.940
SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, I STILL WANT

02:27:29.006 --> 02:27:30.141
TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF

02:27:30.208 --> 02:27:31.442
THINKING LONG TERM. WHEN

02:27:31.509 --> 02:27:32.877
JURISDICTIONS BEGIN TO BUILD OUT

02:27:32.944 --> 02:27:34.178
THEIR RAIL TRANSIT

02:27:34.245 --> 02:27:37.248
INFRASTRUCTURE TO ACKNOWLEDGING

02:27:37.315 --> 02:27:39.083
TO TAKE AUTOMOBILES OFF THE

02:27:39.150 --> 02:27:42.687
ROAD, TYPICALLY THERE IS AN

02:27:42.753 --> 02:27:44.522
OPPORTUNITY TO START CLEANER IF

02:27:44.589 --> 02:27:45.823
THEY BEGIN BY INVESTING IN

02:27:45.890 --> 02:27:47.291
DIESEL LOCOMOTIVES AND

02:27:47.358 --> 02:27:48.859
INFRASTRUCTURE, THEN ANY FUTURE

02:27:48.926 --> 02:27:50.461
INVESTMENT IN LOWER EMISSION OR

02:27:50.528 --> 02:27:51.996
ZERO EMISSION LOCOMOTIVES AND

02:27:52.063 --> 02:27:54.599
INFRASTRUCTURE IS LIKELY TO HAVE

02:27:54.665 --> 02:27:57.168
TO COME MUCH, MUCH LATER, CLOSER

02:27:57.235 --> 02:27:59.570
TO THE END OF THEIR USEFUL LIVES

02:27:59.637 --> 02:28:00.671
AND ADDITIONAL EXPENSE. WE ALL

02:28:00.738 --> 02:28:03.140
KNOW THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS NOW

02:28:03.207 --> 02:28:04.942
AND WE NEED TO REDUCE DIESEL

02:28:05.009 --> 02:28:07.211
EMISSIONS NOW. SB 30 AIMS TO

02:28:07.278 --> 02:28:08.579
REDUCE THE ONGOING HARM CAUSED

02:28:08.646 --> 02:28:09.914
BY EMISSIONS FROM CALIFORNIA'S

02:28:09.981 --> 02:28:12.283
DIESEL ENGINES. ONCE WE REPLACE

02:28:12.350 --> 02:28:14.085
THEM WITH CLEANER ENGINES. THIS

02:28:14.151 --> 02:28:15.753
BILL HAS THE SUPPORT OF MANY

02:28:15.820 --> 02:28:16.554
ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT

02:28:16.621 --> 02:28:18.222
BELIEVE IN A DIESEL FREE FUTURE.

02:28:18.289 --> 02:28:20.024

A PROFESSOR OF PHYSICS AT

02:28:44.882 --> 02:28:46.917
MIRACOSTA COLLEGE IN SAN DIEGO

02:28:46.984 --> 02:28:49.186
COUNTY, NOW EMERITUS, I'VE

02:28:49.253 --> 02:28:50.521
PARTICIPATED IN CLIMATE RESEARCH

02:28:50.588 --> 02:28:51.956
AS A VISITING SCHOLAR AT THE

02:28:52.023 --> 02:28:53.791
SCRIPPS INSTITUTION OF

FOCUSED ON CLIMATE CHANGE

02:29:00.264 --> 02:29:01.999
SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING BLACK

02:29:02.066 --> 02:29:03.834
CARBON AND OTHER CLIMATE SUPER

02:29:03.901 --> 02:29:05.670
POLLUTANTS. IN ADDITION TO THEIR

02:29:05.736 --> 02:29:07.104
EMISSIONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE AND

02:29:07.171 --> 02:29:08.873
A RANGE OF POLLUTANTS, DIESEL

02:29:08.939 --> 02:29:10.241
ENGINES ARE A MAJOR SOURCE OF

02:29:10.308 --> 02:29:12.076
BLACK CARBON, A POTENT WARMING

02:29:12.143 --> 02:29:14.679
AGENT. THESE TINY DARK PARTICLES

02:29:14.745 --> 02:29:16.881
ABSORB SUNLIGHT AND RE-EMIT THAT

02:29:16.947 --> 02:29:18.716
ENERGY, HEATING THE EARTH'S

02:29:18.783 --> 02:29:20.418
SURFACE. WHEN THEY LAND ON SNOW

02:29:20.484 --> 02:29:22.586
OR ICE, THEY SPEED UP MELTING.

02:29:22.653 --> 02:29:24.455
BLACK CARBON PARTICULATES ALSO

02:29:24.522 --> 02:29:26.524
DAMAGE HUMAN HEALTH. THESE TINY

02:29:26.590 --> 02:29:28.759
PARTICLES, LESS THAN 1/30 OF THE

02:29:28.826 --> 02:29:30.461
DIAMETER OF A HUMAN HAIR,

02:29:30.528 --> 02:29:32.330
PENETRATE DEEP INTO THE LUNGS,

02:29:32.396 --> 02:29:34.498
CAUSING RESPIRATORY DISEASE,

02:29:34.565 --> 02:29:36.334
CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, AND LUNG

02:29:36.400 --> 02:29:38.002
CANCER. IT'S ESTIMATED THAT

02:29:38.069 --> 02:29:39.570
ELIMINATING BLACK CARBON

02:29:39.637 --> 02:29:42.840
GLOBALLY WOULD PREVENT ABOUT

02:29:42.907 --> 02:29:43.441
600,000 TO 4.9 MILLION DEATHS

02:29:43.507 --> 02:29:45.643
EACH YEAR. BLACK CARBON

02:29:45.710 --> 02:29:47.078
PARTICLES ONLY STAY IN THE

02:29:47.144 --> 02:29:48.979
ATMOSPHERE FOR A FEW WEEKS,

02:29:49.046 --> 02:29:50.314
HOWEVER, SO CUTTING DIESEL

02:29:50.381 --> 02:29:51.782
EMISSIONS PROVIDES RAPID

02:29:51.849 --> 02:29:53.184
BENEFITS FOR BOTH THE CLIMATE

02:29:53.250 --> 02:29:56.053
AND HUMAN HEALTH. CLIMATE ACTION

02:29:56.120 --> 02:29:57.254
CALIFORNIA BELIEVES THAT THE

02:29:57.321 --> 02:29:58.222
TRANSFER OF DECOMMISSIONED TIER

02:29:58.289 --> 02:30:00.024
TWO AND NEWER DIESEL LOCOMOTIVES

02:30:00.091 --> 02:30:01.525
SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED, UNLESS A

02:30:01.592 --> 02:30:03.227
NET REDUCTION IN GREENHOUSE GAS

02:30:03.294 --> 02:30:04.762
EMISSIONS AND AN AIR QUALITY

02:30:04.829 --> 02:30:07.331
BENEFIT CAN BE SHOWN. HOWEVER,

02:30:07.398 --> 02:30:08.366
THAT PROVISION HAS BEEN REMOVED

02:30:08.432 --> 02:30:10.534
FROM THE BILL. STILL, BY

02:30:10.601 --> 02:30:11.602
PROHIBITING THE TRANSFER OF THE

02:30:11.669 --> 02:30:13.804
MOST HEAVILY POLLUTING TIER ZERO

02:30:15.773 --> 02:30:17.708
SB 30 STILL TAKES AN IMPORTANT

02:30:17.775 --> 02:30:19.877
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

02:30:19.944 --> 02:30:21.779
CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE A WORLD

02:30:21.846 --> 02:30:23.347
LEADER IN DEMONSTRATING CLIMATE

02:30:23.414 --> 02:30:24.949
SOLUTIONS AND PREVENTING OLDER,

02:30:25.015 --> 02:30:27.084
POLLUTING DIESEL ENGINES FROM

02:30:32.089 --> 02:30:33.858
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. I

02:30:33.924 --> 02:30:34.959
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR

02:30:35.025 --> 02:30:37.061
SUPPORT FOR SB 30 TO ENSURE THAT

02:30:37.128 --> 02:30:38.896
CALIFORNIA'S MOST POLLUTING,

02:30:38.963 --> 02:30:39.997
DECOMMISSIONED DIESEL

02:30:40.064 --> 02:30:41.866
LOCOMOTIVES STAY DECOMMISSIONED.

02:30:41.932 --> 02:30:44.568
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. NOW MOVING

02:30:44.635 --> 02:30:46.036
ON, MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO

02:30:46.103 --> 02:30:47.938
WOULD LIKE TO REGISTER, SUPPORT

02:30:48.005 --> 02:30:50.841
OR ADD ON THEIR SUPPORT, PLEASE

02:30:50.908 --> 02:30:52.209
COME TO THE MIC NAME,

02:30:52.276 --> 02:30:54.845
AFFILIATION AND POSITION. GOOD

02:30:59.850 --> 02:31:01.652
NOW MOVING ON TO OPPOSITION. WE

02:31:01.719 --> 02:31:03.854
DO HAVE REGISTERED OPPOSITION.

02:31:03.921 --> 02:31:06.490
SO AS A REMINDER YOU HAVE TWO

02:31:06.557 --> 02:31:14.732
MINUTES FOR TESTIMONY. GOOD

02:31:14.799 --> 02:31:15.599
AFTERNOON, MADAM CHAIR. MEMBERS.

PUBLIC TRANSIT AND RAIL AGENCIES

02:31:21.138 --> 02:31:23.174
STATEWIDE. MADAM CHAIR, WE DO

02:31:23.240 --> 02:31:24.275
APPRECIATE AND THANK YOU FOR THE

02:31:24.341 --> 02:31:25.676
COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. WE DO

02:31:25.743 --> 02:31:27.211
STILL HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE

02:31:27.278 --> 02:31:28.446
BILL. YOU KNOW, FUNDAMENTALLY,

02:31:28.512 --> 02:31:30.414
WE SHARE THE GOAL OF THE AUTHOR

02:31:30.481 --> 02:31:32.583
AND SPONSORS, AND OUR RAIL

02:31:32.650 --> 02:31:34.151
AGENCIES HAVE WORKED TO UPGRADE

02:31:34.218 --> 02:31:36.220
THEIR FLEETS SO THAT, ON

02:31:36.287 --> 02:31:37.288
AVERAGE, THEY ARE JUST ABOUT THE

02:31:37.354 --> 02:31:39.557
CLEANEST IN THE COUNTRY. AS THE

02:31:39.623 --> 02:31:41.325
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS NOTES, THIS

02:31:41.392 --> 02:31:43.093
BILL TARGETS A VERY SMALL SLICE

02:31:43.160 --> 02:31:44.895
OF LOCOMOTIVES. THERE'S JUST

02:31:44.962 --> 02:31:47.398
ABOUT 20 TIER, ZERO TIER ONES IN

02:31:47.465 --> 02:31:50.201
PASSENGER SERVICE, BUT THESE

02:31:50.267 --> 02:31:51.335
LOCOMOTIVES PLAY A VERY

02:31:51.402 --> 02:31:53.137
IMPORTANT ROLE IN EXISTING

02:31:53.204 --> 02:31:54.939
PASSENGER RAIL SERVICE AND IN

02:31:55.005 --> 02:31:56.574
ACTUALLY BENEFITING THE PUBLIC

02:31:56.640 --> 02:31:58.175
BY KEEPING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

02:31:58.242 --> 02:32:00.377
OF CARS OFF THE ROAD. THERE'S

02:32:00.444 --> 02:32:02.713
SUCH A RAIL SHORTAGE NATIONWIDE

02:32:02.780 --> 02:32:03.848
THAT OTHER AGENCIES WOULD BE

02:32:03.914 --> 02:32:05.749
VERY INTERESTED IN ACQUIRING

02:32:05.816 --> 02:32:07.518
THESE IF THEY WERE EVER

02:32:07.585 --> 02:32:08.486
AVAILABLE TO FILL GAPS IN THEIR

02:32:08.552 --> 02:32:11.755
OWN SERVICE. FOR INSTANCE,

02:32:11.822 --> 02:32:13.557
CALTRANS WOULD LIKE TO LEASE OR

02:32:13.624 --> 02:32:15.826
PURCHASE SOME OF CALTRANS

02:32:15.893 --> 02:32:17.194
LOCOMOTIVES, WHICH WOULD BE

02:32:17.261 --> 02:32:18.629
PROHIBITED BY THIS BILL. AND

02:32:18.696 --> 02:32:20.831
I'LL JUST NOTE REGARDING THE

02:32:20.898 --> 02:32:22.399
AUTHOR'S COMMENTS REGARDING

02:32:22.466 --> 02:32:24.401
CALTRANS TRANSFER OF TRAIN SETS

02:32:24.468 --> 02:32:26.904
TO PERU. THAT WAS DONE AS A

02:32:26.971 --> 02:32:28.672
DONATION IN CONCERT WITH

02:32:28.739 --> 02:32:30.241
PRESIDENT BIDEN'S STATE

02:32:30.307 --> 02:32:32.776
DEPARTMENT LAST FALL, AND THE

02:32:32.843 --> 02:32:35.946
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS NOTES THAT

02:32:36.013 --> 02:32:39.483
THIS WILL SHIFT 150 TO 250,000

02:32:39.550 --> 02:32:42.019
DAILY PASSENGERS, DAILY

02:32:42.086 --> 02:32:44.188
PASSENGERS OFF OF BUSSES AND

02:32:44.255 --> 02:32:47.591
CARS IN LIMA. SO THE DEPARTMENT

02:32:47.658 --> 02:32:49.593
OF TRANSPORTATION, THE BAY AREA

02:32:49.660 --> 02:32:51.128
AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT

02:32:51.195 --> 02:32:52.963
BOTH CERTIFIED THAT THIS WOULD

02:32:53.030 --> 02:32:55.466
HAVE A HUGE AIR QUALITY BENEFIT

02:32:55.533 --> 02:32:58.235
TO THE FOLKS IN PERU. WE'VE

02:32:58.302 --> 02:33:00.638
REQUESTED AN AMENDMENT THAT FOR

02:33:00.704 --> 02:33:01.438
AGENCIES THAT WANT TO TRANSFER

02:33:01.505 --> 02:33:03.807
OR SELL OR DONATE TIER ZERO OR

02:33:03.874 --> 02:33:05.809
TIER ONE LOCOMOTIVE, THEY SHOULD

02:33:05.876 --> 02:33:07.378
UNDERTAKE AN AIR QUALITY

02:33:07.444 --> 02:33:08.746
ASSESSMENT. IF THAT ASSESSMENT

02:33:08.812 --> 02:33:10.147
DEMONSTRATES THAT THERE WILL BE

02:33:10.214 --> 02:33:11.949
AN ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT TO THE

02:33:12.016 --> 02:33:13.350
TRANSFER BECAUSE IT RESULTS IN

02:33:13.417 --> 02:33:15.185
FEWER CARS ON THE ROAD OR

02:33:15.252 --> 02:33:17.087
INCREASED RIDERSHIP, THEN WE

02:33:17.154 --> 02:33:18.889
THINK IT MAKES OBVIOUS SENSE TO

02:33:18.956 --> 02:33:22.059
PERMIT THAT TRANSFER ON A CASE

02:33:22.126 --> 02:33:23.527
BY CASE BASIS. THANK YOU, THANK

02:33:23.594 --> 02:33:25.429
YOU. NOW MOVING ON TO MEMBERS OF

02:33:25.496 --> 02:33:27.164
THE PUBLIC WHO WOULD LIKE TO ADD

02:33:27.231 --> 02:33:29.300
ON THEIR OPPOSITION. NOW WOULD

02:33:29.366 --> 02:33:31.101
BE THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO COME

02:33:31.168 --> 02:33:32.970
TO THE MICROPHONE AND NOTE YOUR

02:33:33.037 --> 02:33:36.006
NAME, AFFILIATION AND POSITION.

02:33:36.073 --> 02:33:39.276
SO NONE BRINGING IT BACK TO

02:33:39.343 --> 02:33:41.345
COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS,

02:33:41.412 --> 02:33:46.817
COMMENTS AND OR CONCERNS. SEEING

02:33:46.884 --> 02:33:49.753
NONE, I'LL JUST NOTE THANK YOU

02:33:49.820 --> 02:33:50.821
TO THE SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS

02:33:50.888 --> 02:33:53.023
FORWARD. AND AS YOU NOTED, WE

02:33:53.090 --> 02:33:54.258
HAD A LOT OF ROBUST DISCUSSION

02:33:54.325 --> 02:33:55.326
BACK AND FORTH TRYING TO FIND

02:33:55.392 --> 02:33:56.927
THE RIGHT BALANCE ON THIS BILL.

02:33:56.994 --> 02:33:59.463
I APPRECIATE YOU AND YOUR TEAM

02:33:59.530 --> 02:34:00.097
WORKING WITH OUR COMMITTEE STAFF

02:34:00.164 --> 02:34:02.299
ON THE AMENDMENTS. WE KNOW THAT

02:34:02.366 --> 02:34:04.868
TRANSIT AGENCIES ACROSS THIS

02:34:04.935 --> 02:34:06.003
NATION ARE STRUGGLING

02:34:06.070 --> 02:34:07.638
FINANCIALLY SINCE THE PANDEMIC.

02:34:07.705 --> 02:34:09.907
AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA, IT'S NO

02:34:09.974 --> 02:34:11.909
DIFFERENT. SELLING LOCOMOTIVES

02:34:11.976 --> 02:34:13.544
THEY ARE NO LONGER USING CAN

02:34:13.611 --> 02:34:15.646
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL REVENUE. AND

02:34:15.713 --> 02:34:17.047
AS OUR PUBLIC TRANSIT AGENCIES

02:34:17.114 --> 02:34:18.649
CONTINUE MAKING STRIDES TOWARDS

02:34:18.716 --> 02:34:21.151
CLEANING UP THEIR OLDER DIRTY

02:34:21.218 --> 02:34:22.119
ENGINES, IT IS IMPORTANT TO

02:34:22.186 --> 02:34:23.821
CONSIDER THAT SOME OF THESE

02:34:23.887 --> 02:34:25.789
OLDER ENGINES CAN BE VALUABLE TO

02:34:25.856 --> 02:34:28.659
OTHER AGENCIES. THE LANGUAGE

02:34:28.726 --> 02:34:31.862
SURROUNDING TIER ZERO AND TIER

02:34:31.929 --> 02:34:33.764
ONE SPECIFICALLY RELATES TO

02:34:33.831 --> 02:34:35.566
LOCOMOTIVES OF A PARTICULAR AGE,

02:34:35.633 --> 02:34:36.767
AND THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT

02:34:36.834 --> 02:34:38.836
THAT WE HAD THE AMENDMENT THAT

02:34:38.902 --> 02:34:39.570
EMISSION EQUIVALENT, BECAUSE

02:34:39.637 --> 02:34:41.939
THEY CAN NEVER CHANGE THEIR NAME

02:34:42.006 --> 02:34:43.474
BASICALLY, OR TITLE BY AGE, BUT

02:34:43.540 --> 02:34:45.909
THEY CAN HAVE DIFFERENT

02:34:45.976 --> 02:34:47.111
ENHANCEMENTS THAT MAKE THEM

02:34:47.177 --> 02:34:48.812
LOWER EMITTING VEHICLES. SO WE

02:34:48.879 --> 02:34:50.147
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WASN'T

02:34:50.214 --> 02:34:51.949
CAPTURED. SO I'M SO GLAD THAT

02:34:52.016 --> 02:34:53.150
YOU TOOK THAT AMENDMENT. GIVEN

02:34:53.217 --> 02:34:54.184
ALL THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE ON

02:34:54.251 --> 02:34:56.286
THIS. I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR

02:34:56.353 --> 02:34:59.923
BILL TODAY. I WANT TO SEE IF

02:34:59.990 --> 02:35:01.792
THERE'S WILL ENTERTAIN A MOTION

02:35:01.859 --> 02:35:04.261
OR SECOND AND THEN GIVE YOU AN

02:35:04.328 --> 02:35:06.430
OPPORTUNITY TO CLOSE ONCE WE DO

02:35:06.497 --> 02:35:10.000
SO. SECOND. ALL RIGHT. WE HAVE A

02:35:10.067 --> 02:35:13.070
MOTION BY MY GOOD FRIEND ROGERS

02:35:13.137 --> 02:35:17.574
AND SECONDED BY JACKSON TO THE

SENATOR. OPPORTUNITY TO CLOSE.

02:35:18.475 --> 02:35:20.210
I'M NOT SURE, FRAN, WHAT'S GOING

02:35:20.277 --> 02:35:21.845
ON HERE? I'M SORRY. MY OTHER

02:35:21.912 --> 02:35:23.814
GOOD FRIEND. OH, OKAY. I'M JUST

02:35:23.881 --> 02:35:25.282
CHECKING. I THOUGHT I THOUGHT

02:35:25.349 --> 02:35:26.650
OUR RELATIONSHIP CHANGED OR

02:35:26.717 --> 02:35:28.352
SOMETHING. OKAY. ALL GOOD

02:35:28.419 --> 02:35:29.953
FRIENDS. I APPRECIATE THE WORK

02:35:30.020 --> 02:35:31.689
OF THIS COMMITTEE AND EVERY

02:35:31.755 --> 02:35:34.191
SINGLE MEMBER. BIPARTISAN SHIP

02:35:34.258 --> 02:35:35.859
IS REIGNED SUPREME IN OUR

02:35:35.926 --> 02:35:37.961
COMMITTEE. AND ALL OF YOU ARE MY

02:35:38.028 --> 02:35:39.496
GOOD FRIENDS. AND WITH THAT,

02:35:39.563 --> 02:35:41.298
I'LL GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MY

02:35:41.365 --> 02:35:43.367
OTHER GOOD FRIEND, THE GOOD

02:35:43.434 --> 02:35:45.736
SENATOR FROM SAN JOSE, TO CLOSE.

02:35:45.803 --> 02:35:47.438
THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR. THE

02:35:47.504 --> 02:35:48.872
FEELING IS MUTUAL. I'M GLAD WE

02:35:48.939 --> 02:35:51.075
CAN WORK THROUGH THESE ISSUES AS

02:35:51.141 --> 02:35:53.577
WE DO, AND REMAIN VERY CORDIAL

02:35:53.644 --> 02:35:55.779
AND VERY MUCH FRIENDS GOING

02:35:55.846 --> 02:35:57.381
FORWARD, WORKING ON POLICY HERE

02:35:57.448 --> 02:35:59.817
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE

02:35:59.883 --> 02:36:02.553
ONLY CLARIFICATION I WOULD MAKE,

02:36:02.619 --> 02:36:05.222
YOU KNOW, IS NOT TO MISS THE

02:36:05.289 --> 02:36:07.958
POINT HERE. BASED ON OPPOSITION

02:36:08.025 --> 02:36:09.693
COMMENTS, THIS BILL DOES NOT

02:36:09.760 --> 02:36:14.064
TAKE EXISTING TRAINS THAT PUBLIC

02:36:14.131 --> 02:36:16.233
AGENCIES ARE USING. NOW. THE

02:36:16.300 --> 02:36:17.267
OPPOSITION TALKED ABOUT

02:36:17.334 --> 02:36:20.304
APPROXIMATELY 20 OFF THE TRACKS.

02:36:20.370 --> 02:36:22.773
IT IF THEY TAKE THEM OFF THE

02:36:22.840 --> 02:36:24.708
TRACKS, IF THEY DO IT BECAUSE

02:36:24.775 --> 02:36:26.710
THEY WANT TO REPLACE THEM WITH

02:36:26.777 --> 02:36:28.779
CLEAN VEHICLES, THEN THIS BILL

02:36:28.846 --> 02:36:30.681
KICKS IN AND STARTS TALKING

02:36:30.748 --> 02:36:32.149
ABOUT WHAT LIMITATIONS THERE

02:36:32.216 --> 02:36:33.650
SHOULD BE ON TRANSFER. IT'S A

02:36:33.717 --> 02:36:35.452
REALLY IMPORTANT DISTINCTION, I

02:36:35.519 --> 02:36:40.758
THINK, BECAUSE. THIS ISN'T A

02:36:40.824 --> 02:36:43.260
BILL THAT'S FORCING ANYBODY'S

02:36:43.327 --> 02:36:44.328
EQUIPMENT OFF THE TRACKS, THAT

02:36:44.394 --> 02:36:46.864
BECOMES THEIR DECISION. I DO

02:36:46.930 --> 02:36:48.899
WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE, AND THEN

02:36:48.966 --> 02:36:51.168
I'LL RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I

02:36:51.235 --> 02:36:54.805
VOTE THAT MY COLLEAGUE, SENATOR

02:36:54.872 --> 02:36:59.076

02:36:59.143 --> 02:37:00.244
SOMETHING WE CREATED IN THE

02:37:00.310 --> 02:37:03.113
SENATE TRANSPORTATION AREA,

02:37:03.180 --> 02:37:06.984

THE EC COMMITTEE IN THE SENATE

02:37:14.625 --> 02:37:16.627
AND WORKED WITH US VERY, VERY

02:37:16.693 --> 02:37:20.030
CLOSELY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

02:37:20.097 --> 02:37:21.665
AMENDMENTS TAKEN THERE WERE

02:37:21.732 --> 02:37:24.168
DESIGNED TO NOT IMPACT PROJECTS

02:37:24.234 --> 02:37:25.736
HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT MIGHT AT

02:37:25.803 --> 02:37:27.871
SOME POINT NEED TO TAKE

02:37:27.938 --> 02:37:30.374
ADVANTAGE OF A TRANSFER. AND I

02:37:30.440 --> 02:37:31.909
JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT,

02:37:31.975 --> 02:37:34.778
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT AS WE GET AS

02:37:34.845 --> 02:37:36.180

BETWEEN BOTH HOUSES, THERE ARE

02:37:37.815 --> 02:37:39.116
MORE THAN JUST SENATOR BLAKE

SPHERE THAT REPRESENT AREAS LIKE

02:37:40.951 --> 02:37:42.953
THAT AND PROJECTS LIKE THAT. SO

02:37:43.020 --> 02:37:44.354
WITH THAT, I WOULD RESPECTFULLY

02:37:44.421 --> 02:37:45.889

02:39:53.016 --> 02:39:55.152
$350. AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE

02:39:55.218 --> 02:39:57.020
THAT WE CAN DEAL WITH THAT IF

02:39:57.087 --> 02:39:58.021
THERE'S QUESTION AND ANSWERS

02:39:58.088 --> 02:40:01.258
LATER AS WELL. BUT THERE'S BEEN,

02:40:01.325 --> 02:40:03.360
AS USUAL, SOME FAKE NEWS OUT

02:40:03.427 --> 02:40:05.963
THERE THAT WE ARE HAVE BEEN

02:40:06.029 --> 02:40:08.465
PITCHING A FLAT CAP, WHICH WOULD

02:40:08.532 --> 02:40:10.267
HAVE BEEN THE MAXIMUM THAT THE

02:40:10.334 --> 02:40:12.436
BILL ALLOWED. AND THAT'S NOT THE

02:40:12.502 --> 02:40:16.473
CASE. THIS IS A PERCENTAGE BASED

02:40:16.540 --> 02:40:17.874
CHARGE DOCUMENT CHARGE WITH A

02:40:17.941 --> 02:40:19.276
CAP ON IT. BUT AGAIN WE CAN

02:40:19.343 --> 02:40:21.044
ANSWER QUESTIONS ON THAT LATER

02:40:21.111 --> 02:40:23.046
AS NEED BE UNDER THIS BILL AS

02:40:23.113 --> 02:40:25.682
AMENDED BY THE CHAIR. A DEALER

02:40:25.749 --> 02:40:27.351
MUST NOW DISCLOSE THE CHARGE TO

02:40:27.417 --> 02:40:29.152
THE CONSUMER AT THE TIME THE

02:40:29.219 --> 02:40:30.721
VEHICLE IS ADVERTISED, AND

02:40:30.787 --> 02:40:31.822
SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE THE

02:40:31.888 --> 02:40:32.990
CUSTOMER SIGNS THE FINAL

02:40:33.056 --> 02:40:35.859
CONTRACT, INCLUDING BY WAY OF

02:40:35.926 --> 02:40:37.327
POSTED SIGNAGE AT THE

02:40:37.394 --> 02:40:39.096
DEALERSHIP. SO THIS BILL IS

02:40:39.162 --> 02:40:40.063
NECESSARY BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S

02:40:40.130 --> 02:40:41.898
DPC IS CURRENTLY THE LOWEST IN

02:40:41.965 --> 02:40:43.700
THE NATION, ABOUT ONE FIFTH THE

02:40:43.767 --> 02:40:44.835
NATIONAL AVERAGE. EVEN THOUGH

02:40:44.901 --> 02:40:46.670
OUR STATE AND POSES THE MOST

02:40:46.737 --> 02:40:47.404
STRINGENT DOCUMENT PROCESSING

02:40:47.471 --> 02:40:48.739
AND CONSUMER PROTECTION

02:40:48.805 --> 02:40:50.140
OBLIGATIONS ON DEALERS THAN ANY

02:40:50.207 --> 02:40:52.476
OTHER STATE IN THE COUNTRY WHEN

02:40:52.542 --> 02:40:54.511
IT WAS ESTABLISHED, IT WASN'T

02:40:54.578 --> 02:40:57.481
INDEXED. IT WAS ESTABLISHED AS A

02:40:57.547 --> 02:41:00.017
AS A FLAT CHARGE THAT HAS BEEN

02:41:00.083 --> 02:41:01.385
FALLING FURTHER AND FURTHER

02:41:01.451 --> 02:41:03.186
BEHIND FOR YEARS AND YEARS NOW.

02:41:03.253 --> 02:41:04.688
AT A FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL, THIS

02:41:04.755 --> 02:41:05.956
BILL SIMPLY SEEKS TO ALLOW

02:41:06.023 --> 02:41:07.791
CRITICAL CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES,

02:41:07.858 --> 02:41:08.959
ONES THAT GREATLY CONTRIBUTE TO

02:41:09.026 --> 02:41:10.360
OUR LOCAL AND STATE ECONOMIES,

02:41:10.427 --> 02:41:11.928
TO RECOVER THE COST OF DOING

02:41:11.995 --> 02:41:14.698
BUSINESS. A 2019 J.D. POWER

02:41:14.765 --> 02:41:16.099
STUDY FOUND THAT THE AVERAGE

02:41:16.166 --> 02:41:18.368
COST FOR DEALERS TO PROVIDE

02:41:18.435 --> 02:41:20.470
THESE SERVICES NATIONWIDE IS

02:41:20.537 --> 02:41:23.306
$447 PER TRANSACTION. DEALERS

02:41:23.373 --> 02:41:24.708
PERFORM A WIDE RANGE OF SERVICES

02:41:24.775 --> 02:41:26.143
THAT WOULD OTHERWISE FALL ON

02:41:26.209 --> 02:41:28.412
CONSUMERS. IT'S NOT JUST VEHICLE

02:41:28.478 --> 02:41:29.579
REGISTRATION AND LOAN

02:41:29.646 --> 02:41:31.214
PROCESSING, OR CONTRACT

02:41:31.281 --> 02:41:32.082
TRANSLATION AND FRAUD

02:41:32.149 --> 02:41:33.183
PREVENTION. AS A MATTER OF FACT,

02:41:33.250 --> 02:41:35.986
THERE ARE 13 PAGES NOW ON

02:41:36.053 --> 02:41:37.854
SPREADSHEETS THAT WE HAVE

02:41:37.921 --> 02:41:39.790
AVAILABLE. IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE

02:41:39.856 --> 02:41:42.626
TO SEE THEM WITH 113 DOCUMENTS,

02:41:42.692 --> 02:41:44.861
ALL OF THEM CREATED BY THE

02:41:44.928 --> 02:41:47.130
LEGISLATURE, ALL OF THEM

02:41:47.197 --> 02:41:49.066
STATUTORILY REQUIRED, THAT'S A

02:41:49.132 --> 02:41:51.134
LOT OF GROWTH SINCE THE ORIGINAL

02:41:51.201 --> 02:41:54.671
OR SINCE THE $80 FEE AND THE $85

02:41:54.738 --> 02:41:57.274
FEE WERE APPROVED AS A FLAT FEE

02:41:57.340 --> 02:41:59.743
SOME TIME AGO. WITHOUT THAT

02:41:59.810 --> 02:42:01.878
WORK, WITHOUT THAT SERVICE OF

02:42:01.945 --> 02:42:04.347
SOMEBODY SITTING THERE DEALING

02:42:04.414 --> 02:42:05.582
WITH ALL THOSE DOCUMENTS AND

02:42:05.649 --> 02:42:08.318
GOING DOWN THAT CHECKLIST, THESE

02:42:08.385 --> 02:42:10.220
BUYERS, ALL BUYERS, WOULD NEED

02:42:10.287 --> 02:42:13.090
NOT JUST TO MANAGE, NOT JUST TO

02:42:13.156 --> 02:42:15.625
VISIT DMV, BUT THE VERY STATUTES

02:42:15.692 --> 02:42:16.993
WE PUT IN PLACE ABOUT CATALYTIC

02:42:17.060 --> 02:42:18.128
CONVERTERS AND ANY NUMBER OF

02:42:18.195 --> 02:42:20.230
THINGS WOULDN'T GET DEALT WITH.

02:42:20.297 --> 02:42:22.766
THEY WOULDN'T GET IMPLEMENTED.

02:42:22.833 --> 02:42:25.235
SB 791 ENSURES DEALERSHIPS CAN

02:42:25.302 --> 02:42:25.969
RECOVER REAL COSTS WHILE

02:42:26.036 --> 02:42:28.538
MAINTAINING TRANSPARENCY. WITH

02:42:28.605 --> 02:42:30.674
ME TODAY IS ANTHONY SAMPSON,

02:42:30.740 --> 02:42:32.509
REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA NEW

02:42:32.576 --> 02:42:34.678
CAR DEALERS ASSOCIATION, AND AT

02:42:34.744 --> 02:42:36.046
THE APPROPRIATE TIME, I'D

02:42:36.113 --> 02:42:37.848
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

02:42:37.914 --> 02:42:40.350
THANK YOU. BEFORE WE START

02:42:40.417 --> 02:42:42.219
TESTIMONY, I JUST NOTING THAT

02:42:42.285 --> 02:42:44.287
THE AMENDMENTS WERE MADE PRIOR

02:42:44.354 --> 02:42:46.156
TO COMMITTEE AND CROSSED BY THE

02:42:46.223 --> 02:42:47.791
AUTHOR. AND SO FOR THE MEMBERS

02:42:47.858 --> 02:42:49.159
OF THE COMMITTEE, IT IS JUST A

02:42:49.226 --> 02:42:51.595
DUE PASS. BUT THE COMMENTS

02:42:51.661 --> 02:42:53.497
REFLECT THAT. THE SENATOR NOTED,

02:42:53.563 --> 02:42:56.133
AS A PART OF HIS INTRODUCTION OR

02:42:56.199 --> 02:42:58.235
OPENING, INCLUDE CHANGES THAT

02:42:58.301 --> 02:43:01.171
WERE MADE PRIOR TO THIS. I MEAN,

02:43:01.238 --> 02:43:03.473
THAT HE MADE POST HIS LAST

02:43:03.540 --> 02:43:04.574
COMMITTEE IN CONSULTATION WITH

02:43:04.641 --> 02:43:06.943
OUR COMMITTEE, BUT PRIOR TO THIS

02:43:07.010 --> 02:43:08.678
COMMITTEE. SO IT WILL BE JUST A

02:43:08.745 --> 02:43:10.347
Dð PASS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME.

02:43:10.413 --> 02:43:12.215
VERY CORRECTLY STATED. AND THANK

02:43:12.282 --> 02:43:14.117
YOU FOR THAT LONG LENGTH OF TIME

02:43:14.184 --> 02:43:16.953
OF WORK TO GIVE US THE TIME TO

02:43:17.020 --> 02:43:17.554
MAKE AUTHORS AMENDMENTS. THANK

02:43:17.621 --> 02:43:19.122
YOU, THANK YOU. NOW TO THE

02:43:19.189 --> 02:43:20.056
WITNESS. TWO MINUTES. GREAT.

02:43:20.123 --> 02:43:21.191
THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR AND

02:43:21.258 --> 02:43:22.959
MEMBERS, ANTHONY SAMPSON HERE ON

02:43:23.026 --> 02:43:23.894
BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NEW CAR

02:43:23.960 --> 02:43:25.028
DEALERS ASSOCIATION. FIRST, I'D

02:43:25.095 --> 02:43:27.631
LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR AND THE

02:43:27.697 --> 02:43:28.131
COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE

02:43:28.198 --> 02:43:28.732
CONSTRUCTIVE DISCUSSIONS THAT

02:43:28.798 --> 02:43:30.133
WE'VE HAD TO DATE AND THE WORK

02:43:30.200 --> 02:43:32.068
THEY'VE PUT IN ON THIS MEASURE.

02:43:32.135 --> 02:43:33.336
I'D LIKE TO START BY NOTING THAT

02:43:33.403 --> 02:43:35.071
NEARLY ALL BUSINESSES, RANGING

02:43:35.138 --> 02:43:36.940
FROM RESTAURANTS TO TITLE

02:43:37.007 --> 02:43:38.775
COMPANIES TO OTHER BUSINESSES,

02:43:38.842 --> 02:43:40.143
RECOVER THEIR COSTS SIMPLY BY

02:43:40.210 --> 02:43:41.545
IMPOSING VARIOUS LINE ITEM

02:43:41.611 --> 02:43:43.046
CHARGES AND FEES THAT GO BY

02:43:43.113 --> 02:43:44.714
DIFFERENT NAMES. BUT WHAT'S

02:43:44.781 --> 02:43:46.616
UNIQUE IN THE CONTEXT OF AUTO

02:43:46.683 --> 02:43:48.418
DEALERSHIP IS THAT FOR SEVERAL

02:43:48.485 --> 02:43:49.519
DECADES, AUTO DEALERSHIPS HAVE

02:43:49.586 --> 02:43:51.121
HAD TO COME TO THE LEGISLATURE

02:43:51.188 --> 02:43:52.722
TO GET APPROVAL TO RECOVER THEIR

02:43:52.789 --> 02:43:54.524
COSTS. SPECIFICALLY, CALIFORNIA

02:43:54.591 --> 02:43:55.959
AND MANY OTHER STATES HAVE

02:43:56.026 --> 02:43:57.394
DESIGNATED THE DOCUMENT

02:43:57.460 --> 02:43:59.596
PROCESSING CHARGE A STATUTORILY

02:43:59.663 --> 02:44:00.997
CAPPED CHARGE AS THE MECHANISM

02:44:01.064 --> 02:44:02.799
THROUGH WHICH DEALERSHIPS CAN

02:44:02.866 --> 02:44:04.267
COLLECT THE COSTS ASSOCIATED

02:44:04.334 --> 02:44:06.002
WITH ALL THE SERVICES DEALERS

02:44:06.069 --> 02:44:07.470
PERFORM DURING THE SALES AND

02:44:07.537 --> 02:44:10.373
LEASE TRANSACTION PROCESS. THE

02:44:10.440 --> 02:44:11.841
OPPOSITION HAS STATED THAT THE

02:44:11.908 --> 02:44:13.276
CPC INCREASES HAVE HISTORICALLY

02:44:13.343 --> 02:44:14.678
BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY NEW

02:44:14.744 --> 02:44:17.013
DEALERSHIP OBLIGATIONS. NOTABLY,

02:44:17.080 --> 02:44:18.682
THAT ARGUMENT FAILS TO

02:44:18.748 --> 02:44:20.450
ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT THIS

02:44:20.517 --> 02:44:21.551
LEGISLATURE INTRODUCES AND

02:44:21.618 --> 02:44:23.653
PASSES BILLS PLACING SIGNIFICANT

02:44:23.720 --> 02:44:25.488
NEW OBLIGATIONS ON DEALERS YEAR

02:44:25.555 --> 02:44:26.923
AFTER YEAR, BUT THOSE MEASURES

02:44:26.990 --> 02:44:29.392
DO NOT CONTAIN CORRESPONDING DPC

02:44:29.459 --> 02:44:31.027
INCREASES. IN FACT, THIS YEAR WE

02:44:31.094 --> 02:44:33.063
HAVE SPENT COUNTLESS HOURS ON A

02:44:33.129 --> 02:44:34.297
MEASURE SPONSORED BY THE GROUPS

02:44:34.364 --> 02:44:35.966
THAT ARE MAKING THIS ARGUMENT

02:44:36.032 --> 02:44:37.534
THAT WOULD REPRESENT THE SINGLE

02:44:37.601 --> 02:44:39.903
MOST SIGNIFICANT OVERHAUL OF THE

02:44:39.970 --> 02:44:41.705
VEHICLE SALES TRANSACTION

02:44:41.771 --> 02:44:43.607
PROCESS EVER IN CALIFORNIA. BUT

02:44:43.673 --> 02:44:46.810
THERE IS NO CORRESPONDING DP DPC

02:44:46.876 --> 02:44:48.645
INCREASE ATTACHED TO THAT

02:44:48.712 --> 02:44:50.213
MEASURE. SECOND, THE OPPOSITION

02:44:50.280 --> 02:44:51.781
ARGUES THAT CONSUMERS ARE NOT

02:44:51.848 --> 02:44:53.717
MADE AWARE OF THE DPC UNTIL LATE

02:44:53.783 --> 02:44:55.952
IN THE TRANSACTION PROCESS. THAT

02:44:56.019 --> 02:44:57.587
IS NOT TRUE TODAY, GIVEN THE

02:44:57.654 --> 02:44:58.922
CHARGES DISCLOSED IN THE

02:44:58.989 --> 02:45:01.258
PRE-CONTRACT DISCLOSURE. BUT

02:45:01.324 --> 02:45:02.626
REGARDLESS, THROUGH DISCUSSIONS

02:45:02.692 --> 02:45:04.160
WITH THE CHAIR AND AS THE

02:45:04.227 --> 02:45:05.362
SENATOR POINTED OUT, WE HAVE

02:45:05.428 --> 02:45:07.230
AGREED TO ADD MULTIPLE NEW

02:45:07.297 --> 02:45:08.765
DISCLOSURES, INCLUDING WHEN THE

02:45:08.832 --> 02:45:11.334
PRICE IS ADVERTISED. AND

02:45:11.401 --> 02:45:12.435
FINALLY, THE OPPOSITION ARGUES

02:45:12.502 --> 02:45:13.503
THAT DEALERS SHOULD RECOVER

02:45:13.570 --> 02:45:15.438
THEIR COSTS IN THE PRICE OF THE

02:45:15.505 --> 02:45:17.307
VEHICLE. A COUPLE OF THINGS ON

02:45:17.374 --> 02:45:18.408
THAT, APART FROM THE IMPORTANT

02:45:18.475 --> 02:45:20.277
FACT THAT THIS IS HOW THE LAW

02:45:20.343 --> 02:45:21.611
HAS BEEN STRUCTURED FOR DECADES,

02:45:21.678 --> 02:45:23.046
AND EACH TIME THE CHARGE HAS

02:45:23.113 --> 02:45:24.848
BEEN INCREASED, THE LEGISLATURE

02:45:24.914 --> 02:45:26.650
HAS ENDORSED TREATING THIS AS A

02:45:26.716 --> 02:45:28.485
SEPARATE LINE ITEM CHARGE.

02:45:28.551 --> 02:45:29.919
FIRST, THE ARGUMENT APPLIES THAT

02:45:29.986 --> 02:45:32.155
THERE IS AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT

02:45:32.222 --> 02:45:34.024
DEALERS, LIKE OTHER BUSINESSES,

02:45:34.090 --> 02:45:35.625
SHOULD BE ABLE TO COLLECT THEIR

02:45:35.692 --> 02:45:37.427
COSTS. ASSUMING WE'RE IN

02:45:37.494 --> 02:45:39.095
AGREEMENT ON THAT POINT, THEN

02:45:39.162 --> 02:45:41.131
THE QUESTION IS WHY IS A POLICY

02:45:41.197 --> 02:45:43.233
MATTER? WOULD WE BURY THOSE

02:45:43.300 --> 02:45:45.468
PRICES INTO THE PRICE OF THE

02:45:45.535 --> 02:45:46.536
VEHICLE, RATHER THAN AS A

02:45:46.603 --> 02:45:47.637
SEPARATE LINE ITEM IN

02:45:47.704 --> 02:45:48.171
TRANSPARENT CHARGE THAT IS

02:45:48.238 --> 02:45:49.372
CONSISTENT BOTH FOR CONSUMERS

02:45:49.439 --> 02:45:51.241
AND DEALERS? AND WITH THAT IN

02:45:51.308 --> 02:45:52.475
MIND, IN CLOSING, OUR POSITION,

02:45:52.542 --> 02:45:54.177
AS THE SENATOR NOTED, IS THAT

02:45:54.244 --> 02:45:55.545
THE CHARGE SIMPLY HAS NOT KEPT

02:45:55.612 --> 02:45:57.113
PACE WITH THE OBLIGATIONS

02:45:57.180 --> 02:45:58.782
DEALERS HAVE TAKEN ON IN

02:45:58.848 --> 02:46:00.684
CALIFORNIA. WE APPRECIATE YOUR

02:46:00.750 --> 02:46:02.452
SUPPORT IN HELPING US RESOLVE

02:46:02.519 --> 02:46:03.186
THAT AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR

02:46:03.253 --> 02:46:04.954
YOUR AYE VOTE. MEMBERS OF THE

02:46:05.021 --> 02:46:06.423
PUBLIC WHO WOULD LIKE TO ADD ON

02:46:06.489 --> 02:46:08.124
THEIR SUPPORT, NAME,

02:46:08.191 --> 02:46:09.592
AFFILIATION, AND POSITION CAN

02:46:09.659 --> 02:46:10.694
STAND UP WITH THE CALIFORNIA NEW

02:46:10.760 --> 02:46:12.095
CAR DEALERS, BUT ALSO HERE

02:46:12.162 --> 02:46:13.263
REPRESENTING THE SAN DIEGO NEW

GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

02:46:51.968 --> 02:46:53.737
OPPOSITION TO COME. AS THE

02:46:53.803 --> 02:46:55.572
TESTIMONY WENT A LITTLE BIT

02:46:55.638 --> 02:46:58.408
LONGER, YOU'LL BE GIVEN TWO

02:46:58.475 --> 02:47:11.087

MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS,

ROSEMARY SHAHAN TESTIFYING ON

02:47:13.990 --> 02:47:15.725
BEHALF OF CONSUMERS FOR AUTO

RELIABILITY AND SAFETY, AS WELL

02:47:17.460 --> 02:47:19.329
AS THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME

02:47:19.396 --> 02:47:21.831
CONSUMER COALITION AND CONSUMER

02:47:21.898 --> 02:47:26.169
REPORTS. WE APPRECIATE THE

02:47:26.236 --> 02:47:29.105
AMENDMENT LOWERING THE CAP FROM

02:47:29.172 --> 02:47:34.477
$500 5 TO 350. HOWEVER, WE FEEL

02:47:34.544 --> 02:47:37.680
THAT THE INCREASE IS UNJUSTIFIED

02:47:37.747 --> 02:47:43.887
AND IT'S NOT LOW ENOUGH

02:47:43.953 --> 02:47:46.623
CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT

02:47:46.689 --> 02:47:48.258
DEALERS ACTUALLY MAKE A LOT OF

02:47:48.324 --> 02:47:50.994
PROFIT FROM HANDLING THE

02:47:51.060 --> 02:47:53.263
DOCUMENTS. FOR INSTANCE, WHEN IT

02:47:53.329 --> 02:47:55.765
COMES TO AUTO LOANS, THAT'S

02:47:55.832 --> 02:47:58.935
ACTUALLY A MAJOR PROFIT CENTER

02:47:59.002 --> 02:48:03.239
FOR DEALERS. AND. THERE'S ALSO

02:48:03.306 --> 02:48:07.877
ANOTHER PART OF THE BILL IN THE

02:48:07.944 --> 02:48:10.180
ANALYSIS THAT MENTIONS THAT

02:48:10.246 --> 02:48:12.682
DEALERS SAY THAT THEY SHOULD BE

02:48:12.749 --> 02:48:14.117
COMPENSATED FOR HANDLING TRADE

02:48:14.184 --> 02:48:16.586
INS. THAT'S ANOTHER MAJOR PROFIT

02:48:16.653 --> 02:48:20.990
CENTER FOR DEALERS. AND WE SEE

02:48:21.057 --> 02:48:23.159
THIS AS A ONE SIDED BENEFIT FOR

02:48:23.226 --> 02:48:24.894
DEALERS AT THE EXPENSE OF

02:48:24.961 --> 02:48:26.229
CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS, WHEN WE

02:48:26.296 --> 02:48:27.797
SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON MAKING

02:48:27.864 --> 02:48:30.400
CARS MORE AFFORDABLE. AND NOTE

02:48:30.467 --> 02:48:32.869
THAT IN THE ANALYSIS, ACCORDING

02:48:32.936 --> 02:48:34.771
TO J.D. POWER AND ASSOCIATES,

02:48:34.838 --> 02:48:35.638
THEY RECOMMENDED CONSUMERS THAT

02:48:35.705 --> 02:48:38.842
THEY SHOULDN'T PAY MORE THAN

02:48:38.908 --> 02:48:41.811
$150 FOR THE DOCUMENT FEE. AND

02:48:41.878 --> 02:48:45.482
IN TEXAS, WHERE DEALERS HAVE TO

02:48:45.548 --> 02:48:48.218
ACTUALLY PROVIDE A BASIS IF THEY

02:48:48.284 --> 02:48:50.520
WANT A DOCUMENT FEE INCREASE,

02:48:50.587 --> 02:48:51.955
THAT'S PROVEN IN AN

02:48:52.021 --> 02:48:53.990
ADMINISTRATIVE COURT, TEXAS

02:48:54.057 --> 02:48:57.760
INCREASED THEIR DOCUMENT FEE TO

02:48:57.827 --> 02:49:01.965
$225, SUBSTANTIALLY LESS. AND

02:49:02.031 --> 02:49:03.366
WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THIS IS

02:49:03.433 --> 02:49:05.568
GOING TO BENEFIT MULTIBILLION

02:49:05.635 --> 02:49:07.737
DOLLAR CORPORATIONS, INCLUDING

02:49:07.804 --> 02:49:09.105
TESLA, AT THE EXPENSE OF

02:49:09.172 --> 02:49:12.108
CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. AND WE

02:49:12.175 --> 02:49:13.610
RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR NO

02:49:13.676 --> 02:49:17.814
VOTE. GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS

02:49:17.881 --> 02:49:19.148
RICHARD HOLOBER. I'M THE

02:49:19.215 --> 02:49:20.750

02:49:20.817 --> 02:49:23.253
FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA AND

02:49:23.319 --> 02:49:24.621
ALSO AN OFFICER IN THE

02:49:24.687 --> 02:49:26.456
CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE FOR RETIRED

02:49:26.523 --> 02:49:27.423
AMERICANS. BOTH ORGANIZATIONS

02:49:27.490 --> 02:49:29.692
ARE REGISTERED IN OPPOSITION,

02:49:29.759 --> 02:49:31.261
AND I'M HERE TO REPRESENT THEM.

02:49:31.327 --> 02:49:33.129
AND I REALLY JUST WANTED TO GIVE

02:49:33.196 --> 02:49:34.831
YOU A PERSONAL STORY ABOUT WHAT

02:49:34.898 --> 02:49:37.467
I WENT THROUGH WHEN I PURCHASED

02:49:37.534 --> 02:49:40.870
A NEW CAR SEVERAL YEARS AGO AT A

02:49:40.937 --> 02:49:44.073
MAJOR FRANCHISE CAR DEALER IN

02:49:44.140 --> 02:49:46.175
BURLINGAME, CALIFORNIA. I HAD

02:49:46.242 --> 02:49:49.145
DONE MY HOMEWORK. I HAD A PRETTY

02:49:49.212 --> 02:49:51.481
GOOD SENSE OF WHAT THE ACTUAL

02:49:51.548 --> 02:49:54.884
COSTS WERE TO THE DEALER, AND I

02:49:54.951 --> 02:49:57.654
WAS SHOPPING AROUND, SO I WENT

02:49:57.720 --> 02:49:59.455
TO THE DEALER SAYING, YOU KNOW,

02:49:59.522 --> 02:50:01.324
I'M GOING TO BE BUYING A CAR

02:50:01.391 --> 02:50:03.259
TODAY. IT MIGHT BE FROM YOU, IT

02:50:03.326 --> 02:50:05.094
MIGHT BE FROM 1 OR 2 OTHER FOLKS

02:50:05.161 --> 02:50:07.163
DOWN THE BLOCK. I LIKE YOUR CAR.

02:50:07.230 --> 02:50:08.865
I LIKE THE OTHER CARS. I'M HERE

02:50:08.932 --> 02:50:10.233
TO GET THE BEST DEAL. SO IF WE

02:50:10.300 --> 02:50:12.702
CAN AGREE ON A PRICE, I WILL PAY

02:50:12.769 --> 02:50:14.270
THAT PRICE. I WILL PAY TAX AND I

02:50:14.337 --> 02:50:16.339

02:50:16.406 --> 02:50:19.576
WANT ANY OTHER ADD ONS. I DON'T

02:50:19.642 --> 02:50:21.778
WANT YOU TO HIT ME FOR EXTENDED

02:50:21.844 --> 02:50:24.347
WARRANTIES, FOR UNDERCOATING,

02:50:24.414 --> 02:50:27.216
FOR ANTI-THEFT ETCHING, OR FOR

02:50:27.283 --> 02:50:28.818
DOCUMENT PREPARATION FEES. ONCE

02:50:28.885 --> 02:50:30.653
WE AGREE ON THE PRICE, THAT'S

02:50:30.720 --> 02:50:32.989

02:50:33.056 --> 02:50:36.859
THE OF THE SALES MANAGER GOT

02:50:36.926 --> 02:50:39.062
INVOLVED, WE REACHED AN

02:50:39.128 --> 02:50:42.265
AGREEMENT ON A PRICE. I ACTUALLY

02:50:42.332 --> 02:50:44.067
WALKED OFF THE LOT AT ONE POINT

02:50:44.133 --> 02:50:45.635
AND HE CAME RUNNING AFTER ME

02:50:45.702 --> 02:50:47.036
SAYING, COME BACK, I WENT BACK,

02:50:47.103 --> 02:50:48.571
I'LL GIVE YOU THE PRICE. AND I

02:50:48.638 --> 02:50:50.640

REGISTER IT. OF COURSE, WHEN I

02:50:58.281 --> 02:51:00.350
GOT THE INVOICE, IT INCLUDED THE

02:51:00.416 --> 02:51:02.785
$80 DOCUMENT PREPARATION FEE.

02:51:02.852 --> 02:51:04.220
AND I SAID I THOUGHT WE WERE

02:51:04.287 --> 02:51:05.488
DEALING HONESTLY HERE. I TOLD

02:51:05.555 --> 02:51:07.890
YOU THE PRICE. I TOLD YOU MY

02:51:07.957 --> 02:51:09.258
CONDITIONS AND NOW YOU'RE TRYING

02:51:09.325 --> 02:51:11.361
TO HIT ME. YOU KNOW, I'M AT THE

02:51:11.427 --> 02:51:13.429
GOAL LINE HERE. I'M ABOUT TO BUY

02:51:13.496 --> 02:51:14.430
THIS CAR. AND FIRST THING HE

02:51:14.497 --> 02:51:16.799
SAID WAS, WE'RE REQUIRED TO

02:51:16.866 --> 02:51:18.601
CHARGE IT. IT'S A MANDATED FEE.

02:51:18.668 --> 02:51:20.870
AND I SAID, WELL, LET ME TELL

02:51:20.937 --> 02:51:21.904
YOU WHO I AM. I WAS THE

02:51:21.971 --> 02:51:23.206
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE

02:51:23.272 --> 02:51:24.407
CONSUMER FEDERATION BEFORE I

02:51:24.474 --> 02:51:25.274
RETIRED, AND I HAD WORKED ON

02:51:25.341 --> 02:51:26.909
THIS LEGISLATION IN THE PAST.

02:51:26.976 --> 02:51:28.711
AND I SAID, ACTUALLY, IT'S A

02:51:28.778 --> 02:51:30.513
CAP. YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHARGE

02:51:30.580 --> 02:51:31.681
ANYTHING. YOU'RE NOT PERMITTED

02:51:31.748 --> 02:51:33.116
TO CHARGE ANY MORE THAN THAT

02:51:33.182 --> 02:51:35.184
CAP. AND I DON'T WANT TO PAY

02:51:35.251 --> 02:51:37.053
THAT, THAT FEE. HE THEN SAID TO

02:51:37.120 --> 02:51:39.255
WRAP UP, OKAY. HE THEN SAID, IF

02:51:39.322 --> 02:51:41.157
I CHANGE IT FOR YOU, I HAVE TO

02:51:41.224 --> 02:51:43.259
CHANGE IT FOR EVERYONE. I SAID,

02:51:43.326 --> 02:51:45.261
NO, YOU DON'T. FINALLY, AS I WAS

02:51:45.328 --> 02:51:46.462
READY TO WALK OUT, I SAID, FINE,

02:51:46.529 --> 02:51:48.631
I WILL REDUCE THE PRICE BY $80

02:51:48.698 --> 02:51:50.333
FOR THE INVOICE AND I'LL

02:51:50.400 --> 02:51:52.535
RECAPTURE IT. $80 WITH THE DOCK

02:51:52.602 --> 02:51:54.671
FEE. YOUR PRICE IS THE SAME. I'M

02:51:54.737 --> 02:51:56.873
A HIGHLY EDUCATED CONSUMER

02:51:56.939 --> 02:51:58.307
ADVOCATE. THINK ABOUT WHAT OTHER

02:51:58.374 --> 02:52:00.076
PEOPLE GO THROUGH. THIS IS THE

02:52:00.143 --> 02:52:01.344
LAST STEP BEFORE THEY GET THAT

02:52:01.411 --> 02:52:03.012
DREAMED OF CAR. THANK YOU. THANK

02:52:03.079 --> 02:52:05.148
YOU VERY MUCH. YES, AND SOMEONE

02:52:05.214 --> 02:52:06.683
MAY ASK YOU A QUESTION TO FINISH

02:52:06.749 --> 02:52:09.052
THE STORY. WITH THAT. MOVING ON

02:52:09.118 --> 02:52:10.553
TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO ARE

02:52:10.620 --> 02:52:12.188
IN OPPOSITION NOW WOULD BE AN

02:52:12.255 --> 02:52:13.890
APPROPRIATE TIME TO COME FORWARD

02:52:13.956 --> 02:52:17.060
AND NOTE YOUR OPPOSITION. ONCE

02:52:17.126 --> 02:52:18.928
AGAIN, THAT IS NAME, AFFILIATION

02:52:18.995 --> 02:52:21.431
AND POSITION. SEEING NONE.

02:52:21.497 --> 02:52:23.099
MOVING BACK TO MEMBERS OF THE

02:52:23.166 --> 02:52:25.401
COMMITTEE TO GIVE THEIR

02:52:25.468 --> 02:52:26.636
COMMENTS, QUESTIONS AND

02:52:26.703 --> 02:52:30.573
CONCERNS. JACKSON. THANK YOU.

02:52:30.640 --> 02:52:33.676
THIS IS QUESTIONS TO THE SPONSOR

02:52:33.743 --> 02:52:36.446
OF THE OF THE BILL. I MEAN,

02:52:36.512 --> 02:52:41.584
OBVIOUSLY. THIS BILL ALLOWS YOU

02:52:41.651 --> 02:52:44.020
SITS ANOTHER A NEW CAP IN TERMS

02:52:44.087 --> 02:52:47.557
OF WHAT THEY'RE ABLE TO CHARGE.

02:52:47.623 --> 02:52:49.158
HOWEVER, THAT STILL DOESN'T MEAN

02:52:49.225 --> 02:52:52.295
THE CUSTOMER CANNOT ENGAGE IN

02:52:52.361 --> 02:52:54.263
NEGOTIATIONS OVER THAT FEE. AM I

02:52:54.330 --> 02:52:56.966
CORRECT IN THAT? THROUGH THE

02:52:57.033 --> 02:52:59.502
CHAIR? YES, THAT IS CORRECT. IT

02:52:59.569 --> 02:53:02.672
IS A NEGOTIABLE CHARGE. I WILL

02:53:02.739 --> 02:53:05.208
SAY I WANT TO JUST I THINK YOUR

02:53:05.274 --> 02:53:06.843
QUESTION DOVETAILS NICELY TO THE

02:53:06.909 --> 02:53:08.478
STORY THAT WE JUST HEARD, WHICH

02:53:08.544 --> 02:53:09.912
IS AN UNFORTUNATE ONE. AND I

02:53:09.979 --> 02:53:13.182
WILL TELL YOU THAT TODAY, IF A

02:53:13.249 --> 02:53:15.952
DEALER WERE TO SAY TO A CONSUMER

02:53:16.018 --> 02:53:17.854
THIS THERE'S MY HANDS ARE TIED,

02:53:17.920 --> 02:53:19.622
THIS IS REQUIRED BY THE

02:53:19.689 --> 02:53:20.990
GOVERNMENT. NOTHING I CAN DO

02:53:21.057 --> 02:53:22.525
THAT IS ILLEGAL. THAT IS AN

02:53:22.592 --> 02:53:24.393
ILLEGAL REPRESENTATION FOR WHICH

02:53:24.460 --> 02:53:27.196
THERE OUGHT TO BE A CLAIM. WE'VE

02:53:27.263 --> 02:53:28.631
HAD THIS DISCUSSION WITH THE

02:53:28.698 --> 02:53:30.399
CHAIR AND WORKING THROUGH THE

02:53:30.466 --> 02:53:31.968
AMENDMENTS, AND THE CHAIR, TO

02:53:32.034 --> 02:53:34.036
HER CREDIT, WANTED TO MAKE SURE

02:53:34.103 --> 02:53:35.805
THAT WE MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT

02:53:35.872 --> 02:53:37.774
THIS IS A DEALER DOCUMENT CHARGE

02:53:37.840 --> 02:53:39.175
THAT THE DEALER COLLECTS, AND

02:53:39.242 --> 02:53:40.543
NOT THE GOVERNMENT, WHICH WILL

02:53:40.610 --> 02:53:44.080
BE FURTHER DISCLOSED IN THE

02:53:44.147 --> 02:53:45.481
PRE-CONTRACT DISCLOSURE. BUT TO

02:53:45.548 --> 02:53:47.283
YOUR QUESTION, YOU ARE YOU ARE

02:53:47.350 --> 02:53:49.519
CORRECT. IT IS A CAPPED FEE. IT

02:53:49.585 --> 02:53:53.456
IS NOT A MANDATORY FEE. AND THEN

02:53:53.523 --> 02:53:55.625
THE LEVEL OF FEE IS ALSO

02:53:55.691 --> 02:53:58.895
ASSOCIATED BASED UPON THE PRICE

02:53:58.961 --> 02:54:01.430
OF THE VEHICLE. THAT IS CORRECT.

02:54:01.497 --> 02:54:03.633
WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT ONE

02:54:03.699 --> 02:54:06.135
OF THE CRITICISMS, NOT ONLY IN

02:54:06.202 --> 02:54:08.204
CALIFORNIA BUT IN OTHER STATES,

02:54:08.271 --> 02:54:10.206
IS THE FACT THAT IT'S REGRESSIVE

02:54:10.273 --> 02:54:11.841
IN NATURE. SOMEBODY PURCHASING A

02:54:11.908 --> 02:54:13.342
HONDA CIVIC, FOR EXAMPLE, WAS

02:54:13.409 --> 02:54:15.578
GOING TO PAY THE SAME AMOUNT AS

02:54:15.645 --> 02:54:17.213
SOMEBODY PURCHASING A FERRARI

02:54:17.280 --> 02:54:19.482
TESTAROSSA, RIGHT? WE WANTED TO

02:54:19.549 --> 02:54:23.019
MAKE SURE THAT WE DID A

02:54:23.085 --> 02:54:24.053
PERCENTAGE CHARGE TO ENSURE THAT

02:54:24.120 --> 02:54:28.291
THOSE PURCHASING A LESSER

02:54:28.357 --> 02:54:30.459
EXPENSIVE VEHICLE SAY IT WAS A

02:54:30.526 --> 02:54:32.795
$20,000 VEHICLE THAT WOULD BE

02:54:32.862 --> 02:54:34.931
200, WHEREAS IF YOU GO UP, YOU

02:54:34.997 --> 02:54:36.299
ULTIMATELY HIT THAT CAP. AND

02:54:36.365 --> 02:54:37.533
ANYTHING BEYOND THAT STAYS AT

02:54:37.600 --> 02:54:39.969
THAT CAP. BUT THIS WAS AN EFFORT

02:54:40.036 --> 02:54:42.271
TO TRY TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT

02:54:42.338 --> 02:54:43.706
MORE PROGRESSIVE IN TERMS OF THE

02:54:43.773 --> 02:54:44.974
STRUCTURE OF THE CHARGE. WHAT

02:54:45.041 --> 02:54:46.642
WOULD BE THE ACCORDING TO THIS

02:54:46.709 --> 02:54:48.945
BILL, WHAT WOULD BE THE LOWEST

02:54:49.011 --> 02:54:51.080
FEE ASSOCIATED BASED UPON A CAR

02:54:51.147 --> 02:54:53.249
PRICE, I SUPPOSE, I SUPPOSE

02:54:53.316 --> 02:54:55.084
$0.01 IF YOU BOUGHT A $1 CAR,

02:54:55.151 --> 02:54:57.153
BUT I MEAN IT WOULD. THIS IS

02:54:57.220 --> 02:54:58.287
CALIFORNIA. NO, DON'T DON'T LIE.

02:54:58.354 --> 02:55:00.156
NO, NO, IT'S A GREAT QUESTION. I

02:55:00.223 --> 02:55:02.191
MEAN, YOU KNOW, LET'S JUST SAY A

02:55:02.258 --> 02:55:03.693
$10,000 VEHICLE, IT'S A $100

02:55:03.759 --> 02:55:05.561
CHARGE. I MEAN, AN $8,000

02:55:05.628 --> 02:55:06.996
VEHICLE WOULD BE AN $80 CHARGE.

02:55:07.063 --> 02:55:09.265
SO IT'S IT DEPENDS ON WHAT THE

02:55:09.332 --> 02:55:11.000
LOWEST COST OF THE VEHICLE IS.

02:55:11.067 --> 02:55:12.134
GOT IT. I THINK. LASTLY, MADAM

02:55:12.201 --> 02:55:14.136
CHAIR, I KNOW YOU ENGAGED WITH

02:55:14.203 --> 02:55:16.472
THE AUTHOR IN TERMS OF ENSURING

02:55:16.539 --> 02:55:20.309
THAT CONSUMERS CAN SEE THAT

02:55:20.376 --> 02:55:22.845
UPFRONT AS PART. I KNOW THIS

02:55:22.912 --> 02:55:24.480
LEGISLATURE HAS DONE A LOT OF

02:55:24.547 --> 02:55:26.983
WORK ON MYSTERY FEES AND ALL

02:55:27.049 --> 02:55:28.284
THOSE TYPE OF THINGS, SURPRISE

02:55:28.351 --> 02:55:30.353
FEES AT THE END OF THE DAY. AND

02:55:30.419 --> 02:55:32.622
SO HOW DOES THAT WORK? DOES THAT

02:55:32.688 --> 02:55:33.890
MEAN THAT WHEN I SEE THAT

02:55:33.956 --> 02:55:35.725
STICKER ON THE CAR, IT'LL ALSO

02:55:35.791 --> 02:55:37.560
HAVE THE PRICE OF WHAT THE

02:55:37.627 --> 02:55:38.861
APPLICATION FEE WOULD BE, OR AT

02:55:38.928 --> 02:55:41.931
WHAT POINT WILL THE CONSUMER BE

02:55:41.998 --> 02:55:44.066
ABLE TO SEE THAT PRICE. YEAH,

02:55:44.133 --> 02:55:46.535
IT'S A GOOD IT'S A GOOD

02:55:46.602 --> 02:55:48.271
QUESTION. SO IT'S IN THE

02:55:48.337 --> 02:55:50.039
ADVERTISED PRICE OF THE VEHICLE.

02:55:50.106 --> 02:55:52.642
SO IF YOU GO ONLINE RIGHT AND

02:55:52.708 --> 02:55:55.177
YOU SEARCH FOR A VEHICLE AND IT

02:55:55.244 --> 02:55:57.680
SAYS A $50,000 VEHICLE TODAY

02:55:57.747 --> 02:55:59.482
THERE IS A DISCLOSURE THAT IS

02:55:59.548 --> 02:56:00.917
REQUIRED. AND IT'S AND IT'S

02:56:00.983 --> 02:56:02.752
REQUIRED TO SAY, YOU KNOW, THIS,

02:56:02.818 --> 02:56:04.787
YOU KNOW, EXCLUSIVE OF TAXES,

02:56:04.854 --> 02:56:06.622
FEES AND A DEALER DOCUMENT

02:56:06.689 --> 02:56:08.424
PROCESSING CHARGE. AGAIN, IN

02:56:08.491 --> 02:56:09.525
DISCUSSIONS WITH THE CHAIR, I

02:56:09.592 --> 02:56:11.661
THINK THE CHAIR HAD EXPRESSED

02:56:11.727 --> 02:56:14.597
CONCERNS THAT YOU CAN'T THAT

02:56:14.664 --> 02:56:15.965
SURE, A DEALER DOCUMENT

02:56:16.032 --> 02:56:17.099
PROCESSING CHARGE, THAT DOESN'T

02:56:17.166 --> 02:56:18.534
MEAN MUCH TO VERY MANY PEOPLE

02:56:18.601 --> 02:56:20.369
BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

02:56:20.436 --> 02:56:22.939
COST, WHAT THAT IS. AND SO WHAT

02:56:23.005 --> 02:56:25.808
WOULD BE NOW REQUIRED UNDER THE

02:56:25.875 --> 02:56:27.510
AMENDMENTS THAT ARE IN PRINT IS

02:56:27.576 --> 02:56:31.180
THAT IT WOULD SAY NOT TO EXCEED

02:56:31.247 --> 02:56:32.581
$350, KNOWING THAT GOING INTO

02:56:32.648 --> 02:56:35.084
THE DEALERSHIP, YOU ARE GOING TO

02:56:35.151 --> 02:56:36.619
BE YOU KNOW, THE CHARGE WILL BE

02:56:36.686 --> 02:56:38.721
AT A MAX 350, BUT CERTAINLY

02:56:38.788 --> 02:56:40.056
PERHAPS BELOW THAT, DEPENDING ON

02:56:40.122 --> 02:56:41.624
THE PRICE OF THE VEHICLE. OKAY.

02:56:41.691 --> 02:56:43.793
THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR. AND JUST

02:56:43.859 --> 02:56:46.929
TO BE CLEAR, IT ALSO DOES IT IN

02:56:46.996 --> 02:56:50.599
THE CUBICLE, THE CELLS. RIGHT.

02:56:50.666 --> 02:56:52.401
AND AS WELL AS IN THE

02:56:52.468 --> 02:56:54.503
PRE-CONTRACT WRITTEN. SO THERE'S

02:56:54.570 --> 02:56:56.038
THREE OPPORTUNITIES TO SEE THIS

02:56:56.105 --> 02:56:59.575
NOT TO EXCEED $350 CHARGE PRIOR

02:56:59.642 --> 02:57:02.478
TO EVER NEGOTIATING THE PRICE.

02:57:02.545 --> 02:57:03.245
CORRECT. THAT'S CORRECT. IT

02:57:03.312 --> 02:57:05.715
WOULD BE IN MULTIPLE LOCATIONS.

02:57:05.781 --> 02:57:07.683
YES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND I

02:57:07.750 --> 02:57:09.485
THINK ON ONE OF YOUR COMMENTS, I

02:57:09.552 --> 02:57:11.354
WANT TO GIVE IT A CHANCE, I

02:57:11.420 --> 02:57:13.022
THINK ON ONE OF YOUR QUESTIONS,

02:57:13.089 --> 02:57:16.225
OPPOSITION WANTED TO TESTIFY, I

02:57:16.292 --> 02:57:20.997
THOUGHT I SAW. MISS SHEEHAN. DID

02:57:21.063 --> 02:57:22.898
YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING? I

02:57:22.965 --> 02:57:25.434
WANT TO GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY

02:57:25.501 --> 02:57:26.402
TO SAY SOMETHING. THANK YOU,

02:57:26.469 --> 02:57:28.437
MADAM CHAIR. AND SO YOUR

02:57:28.504 --> 02:57:30.239
QUESTION, SIR. ASSEMBLY MEMBER,

02:57:30.306 --> 02:57:32.341
ABOUT WHETHER IT'S NEGOTIABLE. I

02:57:32.408 --> 02:57:34.010
THINK THEORETICALLY IT IS. BUT

02:57:34.076 --> 02:57:36.045
AS A PRACTICAL MATTER, IT ENDS

02:57:36.112 --> 02:57:38.447
UP CONSUMERS ARE GOING TO PAY

02:57:38.514 --> 02:57:41.417
350. YOU KNOW, IT'S A RARE

02:57:41.484 --> 02:57:43.953
OCCASION WHEN PEOPLE AT THE

02:57:44.020 --> 02:57:46.822
USUALLY AT THE END OF THE

02:57:46.889 --> 02:57:48.090
TRANSACTION WHEN THEY'VE BEEN

02:57:48.157 --> 02:57:49.859
SPENDING OFTEN HOURS SHOPPING

02:57:49.925 --> 02:57:52.228
FOR A CAR THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

02:57:52.294 --> 02:57:55.698
SAY, YOU KNOW, I'M NEGOTIATING

02:57:55.765 --> 02:57:58.200
THIS. AND WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM

02:57:58.267 --> 02:57:59.368
CONSUMERS, NOT ONLY IN

02:57:59.435 --> 02:58:00.903
CALIFORNIA BUT IN OTHER STATES,

02:58:00.970 --> 02:58:02.471
WHEN THEY QUESTION IT, THEY'RE

02:58:02.538 --> 02:58:04.740
OFTEN TOLD, I CAN'T CHARGE YOU A

02:58:04.807 --> 02:58:06.909
DIFFERENT AMOUNT BECAUSE THAT

02:58:06.976 --> 02:58:09.111
WOULD BE DISCRIMINATORY.

02:58:09.178 --> 02:58:10.479
EVERYONE HAS TO BE CHARGED THE

02:58:10.546 --> 02:58:14.550
SAME AMOUNT, AND CONSUMERS

02:58:14.617 --> 02:58:19.188
AREN'T IN A POSITION TO SAY NO.

02:58:19.255 --> 02:58:24.360
I'M OVERRIDING THAT. ALL RIGHT.

02:58:24.427 --> 02:58:29.298
IS THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS?

02:58:29.365 --> 02:58:35.337
LOWENTHAL. YEAH, I HAVE A COUPLE

02:58:35.404 --> 02:58:39.675
QUESTIONS FOR THE PROPONENTS.

02:58:39.742 --> 02:58:41.043
ACTUALLY. FIRST QUESTION I HAVE

02:58:41.110 --> 02:58:42.645
TO ASK IS, MR. SAMPSON, WHAT

02:58:42.711 --> 02:58:44.380
WHAT FEES ARE RESTAURANTS

02:58:44.447 --> 02:58:46.582
CHARGING TO RECOVER COSTS THAT

02:58:46.649 --> 02:58:49.685
YOU'RE REFERRING TO? SO I CAN SO

02:58:49.752 --> 02:58:52.154
LONG AS WE'RE PROVIDING SOME

02:58:52.221 --> 02:58:54.123
STORIES OF OUR OWN EXPERIENCES.

02:58:54.190 --> 02:58:55.558
MAYA. WELL, RIGHT DOWN THE

02:58:55.624 --> 02:58:58.527
STREET, YOU SIT DOWN AND LOOK AT

02:58:58.594 --> 02:59:01.297
THAT MENU AT THE BOTTOM. IT SAYS

02:59:01.363 --> 02:59:03.099
THAT THERE WILL BE I DON'T KNOW

02:59:03.165 --> 02:59:05.334
WHAT THE PERCENTAGE IS IN X

02:59:05.401 --> 02:59:06.769
PERCENT SERVICE CHARGE. YOU

02:59:06.836 --> 02:59:08.471
KNOW, THERE ARE DIFFERENT

02:59:08.537 --> 02:59:09.905
CHARGES. THEY'RE CALLING IT

02:59:09.972 --> 02:59:11.107
DIFFERENT THINGS DEPENDING ON

02:59:11.173 --> 02:59:14.176
THE TYPE OF BUSINESS. BUT BUT

02:59:14.243 --> 02:59:15.678
THEY ARE ADJUSTING BASED ON.

02:59:15.744 --> 02:59:17.880
THAT'S A GOOD ANALOGY AT ALL.

02:59:17.947 --> 02:59:20.516
THAT'S, THAT'S THAT'S A WAY TO

02:59:20.583 --> 02:59:22.885
DISTRIBUTE SERVICES FOR WORKERS

02:59:22.952 --> 02:59:25.020
ACTUALLY THAT DOESN'T GO TO THE

02:59:25.087 --> 02:59:26.088
RESTAURANT. I THINK WHAT YOU'RE

02:59:26.155 --> 02:59:28.190
TALKING ABOUT IS RECOVERING

02:59:28.257 --> 02:59:31.460
COSTS OF ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW,

02:59:31.527 --> 02:59:32.995
SOME ADMINISTRATIVE FEE, WHICH I

02:59:33.062 --> 02:59:34.830
THINK IS VASTLY DIFFERENT THAN

02:59:34.897 --> 02:59:37.399
THE WAY TIPS ARE ACTUALLY

02:59:37.466 --> 02:59:38.400
HANDLED BETWEEN THE FRONT OF THE

02:59:38.467 --> 02:59:40.069
HOUSE AND THE BACK OF THE HOUSE.

02:59:40.136 --> 02:59:42.738
AND A LOT OF PLACES HAVE MOVED

02:59:42.805 --> 02:59:43.372
TO ADMINISTRATIVE FEES SO THAT

02:59:43.439 --> 02:59:45.074
THE BACK OF THE HOUSE CAN ENJOY

02:59:45.141 --> 02:59:46.108
WHAT THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE

02:59:46.175 --> 02:59:47.643
CURRENTLY ENJOYS. SO WITHOUT

02:59:47.710 --> 02:59:49.245
GETTING INTO THAT, I JUST DON'T

02:59:49.311 --> 02:59:50.379
THINK THAT THAT'S A GOOD FROM

02:59:50.446 --> 02:59:52.047
SOMEBODY IN THE RESTAURANT

02:59:52.114 --> 02:59:53.449
INDUSTRY. THAT'S A GOOD ANALOGY.

02:59:53.516 --> 02:59:54.550
HAVING SAID THAT, I

02:59:54.617 --> 02:59:55.751
FUNDAMENTALLY AGREE THAT THERE

02:59:55.818 --> 02:59:59.188
SHOULD BE FAIRNESS ACROSS STATES

02:59:59.255 --> 03:00:00.956
WHEN IT COMES TO THIS, SO I

03:00:01.023 --> 03:00:03.592
DON'T BEGRUDGE THE IMPETUS FOR

03:00:03.659 --> 03:00:06.095
THIS BILL. WHAT I'M TRULY

03:00:06.162 --> 03:00:08.264
TROUBLED BY. AND WE'VE HAD

03:00:08.330 --> 03:00:08.964
CONVERSATION, DIRECT

03:00:09.031 --> 03:00:10.099
CONVERSATION EARLIER TODAY AND

03:00:10.166 --> 03:00:12.268
WITH MR. STANHOPE EARLIER, IS

03:00:12.334 --> 03:00:16.138
THE TIMING OF THIS. IT IS A VERY

03:00:16.205 --> 03:00:17.473
DIFFICULT TIME FOR CONSUMERS IN

03:00:17.540 --> 03:00:19.808
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE

03:00:19.875 --> 03:00:21.610
AFFORDABILITY CRISIS THAT IS IN

03:00:21.677 --> 03:00:24.113
AN AWFUL POSITION, AND I REALLY

03:00:24.180 --> 03:00:25.848
WANT TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS

03:00:25.915 --> 03:00:26.882
BILL AND BE SUPPORTIVE OF NEW

03:00:26.949 --> 03:00:29.518
CAR DEALERS. AND I AS I, I ASKED

03:00:29.585 --> 03:00:31.253
YOU OUTSIDE AND I WOULD LIKE TO

03:00:31.320 --> 03:00:32.988
ASK FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE

03:00:33.055 --> 03:00:34.456
MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AND TO

03:00:34.523 --> 03:00:35.758
THE GENERAL PUBLIC, WOULD YOU

03:00:35.824 --> 03:00:39.962
CONSIDER TYING INCREASES TO

03:00:40.029 --> 03:00:44.233
ECONOMIC INDEX INDICES THAT

03:00:44.300 --> 03:00:47.870
WHERE CONSUMERS CAN BETTER

03:00:47.937 --> 03:00:49.305
WITHSTAND SUCH A JUMP AT ANY

03:00:49.371 --> 03:00:50.739
GIVEN TIME, WOULD HAVE THE

03:00:50.806 --> 03:00:53.108
ABILITY TO DO SO IN CONCERT WITH

03:00:53.175 --> 03:00:57.112
HOW THE ECONOMY IS DOING? YEAH,

03:00:57.179 --> 03:00:59.114
AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION,

03:00:59.181 --> 03:01:01.183
ASSEMBLY MEMBER, AND APPRECIATE

03:01:01.250 --> 03:01:03.986
THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE'VE WE'VE

03:01:04.053 --> 03:01:06.055
HAD. I WILL TELL YOU, IT'S FUNNY

03:01:06.121 --> 03:01:07.523
IT SOUNDS LIKE A SIMPLE ISSUE.

03:01:07.590 --> 03:01:09.225
IT'S SORT OF CHANGING A NUMBER

03:01:09.291 --> 03:01:10.893
TO A DIFFERENT NUMBER, ADDING A

03:01:10.960 --> 03:01:12.628
PERCENT. THERE ARE MULTIPLE

03:01:12.695 --> 03:01:14.797
DIFFERENT WAYS THAT THIS ISSUE

03:01:14.863 --> 03:01:17.032
CAN BE APPROACHED. WE'RE MINDFUL

03:01:17.099 --> 03:01:18.500
OF THE COMMENTS THAT YOU RAISE.

03:01:18.567 --> 03:01:20.302
AND SO TO THAT END, WHAT I WOULD

03:01:20.369 --> 03:01:23.539
TELL YOU IS, YOU KNOW, WHILE WE

03:01:23.606 --> 03:01:25.674
LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF TIME LEFT

03:01:25.741 --> 03:01:26.775
IN THE SESSION, IT DOESN'T

03:01:26.842 --> 03:01:28.477
APPEAR THAT THERE'S MUCH. BUT IN

03:01:28.544 --> 03:01:29.745
LEGISLATIVE SPEAK, THERE IS

03:01:29.812 --> 03:01:31.847
QUITE A LOT OF TIME TO HAVE

03:01:31.914 --> 03:01:32.915
THESE DISCUSSIONS AS I COMMITTED

03:01:32.982 --> 03:01:34.183
TO YOU BEFORE, AND I WOULD

03:01:34.250 --> 03:01:38.287
COMMIT TO YOU NOW. WE ARE WE

03:01:38.354 --> 03:01:39.822
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE MAY BE

03:01:39.888 --> 03:01:40.623
MULTIPLE WAYS TO ADDRESS THIS.

03:01:40.689 --> 03:01:42.324
YOU WOULD WE TALKED ABOUT PHASED

03:01:42.391 --> 03:01:44.994
IN WHAT HAVE YOU. AND WE ARE WE

03:01:45.060 --> 03:01:46.862
ARE MORE THAN OPEN TO HAVING

03:01:46.929 --> 03:01:48.063
THOSE DISCUSSIONS MOVING

03:01:48.130 --> 03:01:51.400
FORWARD. THERE IS NO PERFECT WAY

03:01:51.467 --> 03:01:53.002
TO ADDRESS AN ISSUE LIKE THIS.

03:01:53.068 --> 03:01:55.271
AND SO I WOULD AND I WOULD JUST

03:01:55.337 --> 03:01:56.305
NOTE WE DON'T WANT TO GET INTO

03:01:56.372 --> 03:01:59.408
NEGOTIATING ON IN THE COMMITTEE

03:01:59.475 --> 03:02:01.710
BECAUSE WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT

03:02:01.777 --> 03:02:03.078
THIS IN TWO DIFFERENT

03:02:03.145 --> 03:02:04.546
COMMITTEES, THIS PRICE AND HOW

03:02:04.613 --> 03:02:06.982
WE ACHIEVE THIS. AND SO IT WOULD

03:02:07.049 --> 03:02:10.853
HAVE TO COME BACK IF THERE WERE

03:02:10.919 --> 03:02:11.754
FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS AROUND THE

03:02:11.820 --> 03:02:13.756
TOP PART. AND I DO UNDERSTAND

03:02:13.822 --> 03:02:15.924
THE CONCERN OF AFFORDABILITY.

03:02:15.991 --> 03:02:18.360
THAT'S TOP OF MIND. AND TYING TO

03:02:18.427 --> 03:02:20.729
SOME KIND OF ECONOMIC INDICATOR.

03:02:20.796 --> 03:02:22.031
PART OF AN ECONOMIC INDICATOR IS

03:02:22.097 --> 03:02:23.599
THE ACTUAL PRICE OF THE VEHICLE

03:02:23.666 --> 03:02:25.901
AND WHAT THE MARKET WOULD BEAR,

03:02:25.968 --> 03:02:27.202
BASED ON WHAT IS HAPPENING AT

03:02:27.269 --> 03:02:28.304
ANY PARTICULAR GIVEN MOMENT

03:02:28.370 --> 03:02:30.372
THROUGH SUPPLY AND DEMAND. SO

03:02:30.439 --> 03:02:31.940
JUST NOTING THAT BECAUSE IT IS A

03:02:32.007 --> 03:02:33.275
FLEXIBLE DOLLAR AMOUNT NOW

03:02:33.342 --> 03:02:35.978
VERSUS A FLAT FEE AND SOMEONE

03:02:36.045 --> 03:02:37.880
BUYING A $10,000 CAR WOULD NOT

03:02:37.946 --> 03:02:39.782
BE FAR OFF FROM THIS AMOUNT. BUT

03:02:39.848 --> 03:02:41.950
I JUST WANTED TO KEEP THAT IN

03:02:42.017 --> 03:02:43.786
MIND AS WE CONTINUE IN THE

03:02:43.852 --> 03:02:45.487
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IN ORDER TO

03:02:45.554 --> 03:02:46.889
ACHIEVE A SUCCESSFUL PATHWAY TO

03:02:46.955 --> 03:02:48.390
THE GOVERNOR'S DESK. OF COURSE,

03:02:48.457 --> 03:02:49.558
MORE CONVERSATIONS WITH

03:02:49.625 --> 03:02:51.727
HAPPENING, BUT WE HAVE HAD A

03:02:51.794 --> 03:02:54.129
COUPLE OF COMMITTEES WEIGH IN ON

03:02:54.196 --> 03:02:56.465
THE AMOUNT. SURE, I CAN ONLY

03:02:56.532 --> 03:02:58.967
SPEAK FOR MYSELF AND SPEAKING

03:02:59.034 --> 03:03:01.203
FOR MYSELF. I WOULD ONLY WANT TO

03:03:01.270 --> 03:03:02.304
SUPPORT THIS BILL UNDER THE

03:03:02.371 --> 03:03:03.072
COMMITMENT THAT YOU JUST MADE.

03:03:03.138 --> 03:03:06.308
AND I'M AS TO THE TO THE HOLD

03:03:06.375 --> 03:03:09.712
ON, HOLD ON TO A MEMBER OF MY

03:03:09.778 --> 03:03:11.146
COMMITTEE, I WOULD JUST LIKE TO

03:03:11.213 --> 03:03:14.316
NOTE AS CHAIR, I'VE SPOKEN ABOUT

03:03:14.383 --> 03:03:16.885
THIS AMOUNT. WE WILL NOT BE

03:03:16.952 --> 03:03:18.220
NEGOTIATING THIS PARTICULAR

03:03:18.287 --> 03:03:21.323
AMOUNT DURING COMMITTEE. IF YOU

03:03:21.390 --> 03:03:23.292
ARE INTERESTED IN NOT SUPPORTING

03:03:23.359 --> 03:03:24.626
THIS TODAY OR NOT SUPPORTING ON

03:03:24.693 --> 03:03:26.628
THE FLOOR RELATED TO THAT, THAT

03:03:26.695 --> 03:03:27.663
IS FINE TO HAVE THOSE

03:03:27.730 --> 03:03:29.832
NEGOTIATIONS. BUT I HAVE SPOKEN

03:03:29.898 --> 03:03:31.967
AS CHAIR THAT THOSE FURTHER

03:03:32.034 --> 03:03:34.203
NEGOTIATIONS WOULD BRING THIS

03:03:34.269 --> 03:03:35.604
BACK TO MY COMMITTEE. AND MAKING

03:03:35.671 --> 03:03:37.373
IT VERY CLEAR, IF YOU HAVE

03:03:37.439 --> 03:03:38.640
FURTHER COMMENTS THAT YOU WOULD

03:03:38.707 --> 03:03:41.377
LIKE TO GIVE, YOU CAN DO THOSE.

03:03:41.443 --> 03:03:42.544
OTHERWISE. WE DO HAVE TWO OTHER

03:03:42.611 --> 03:03:45.047
MEMBERS WHO HAVE ASKED TO SPEAK.

03:03:45.114 --> 03:03:46.048
I'M NOT SURE IF ANYONE THAT'S ON

03:03:46.115 --> 03:03:48.450
THIS MY LEFT SIDE APP. SO ALL

03:03:48.517 --> 03:03:50.886
RIGHT. WITH THAT, I'LL MOVE IT

03:03:50.953 --> 03:03:53.489
OVER TO ROGERS AND THEN HART.

03:03:53.555 --> 03:03:56.024
THANK YOU CHAIR. SO ONE OF MY

03:03:56.091 --> 03:03:58.927
QUESTIONS WAS DIRECTLY RELATED

03:03:58.994 --> 03:04:01.597
TO WHAT MY COLLEAGUE WAS ASKING.

03:04:01.663 --> 03:04:03.632
BUT I'LL SHELVE THAT FOR THE

03:04:03.699 --> 03:04:06.201
MOMENT. ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT

03:04:06.268 --> 03:04:08.337
WAS DISCUSSED IN ONE OF THE

03:04:08.404 --> 03:04:09.705
LETTERS THAT THE COMMITTEE

03:04:09.772 --> 03:04:11.540
RECEIVED WAS THAT, IN ADDITION,

03:04:11.607 --> 03:04:15.911
WHILE YOU DO HAVE A LINE ITEM

03:04:15.978 --> 03:04:17.045
FOR COST RECOVERY FOR THE

03:04:17.112 --> 03:04:18.714
DOCUMENT FEE, YOU ALSO HAVE

03:04:18.781 --> 03:04:22.284
OTHER AREAS WHERE PERHAPS THE

03:04:22.351 --> 03:04:24.987
TOTAL STAFF COSTS OR THE COST OF

03:04:25.053 --> 03:04:27.189
DOING BUSINESS CAN BE RECOUPED.

03:04:27.256 --> 03:04:30.292
AND ONE IN PARTICULAR WAS, IT

03:04:30.359 --> 03:04:32.461
SAYS, KICKBACKS FOR LENDERS IN

03:04:32.528 --> 03:04:34.696
EXCHANGE FOR ASSIGNING LOANS.

03:04:34.763 --> 03:04:36.231
AND I'M HOPING YOU CAN GIVE ME A

03:04:36.298 --> 03:04:38.033
LITTLE BIT OF INFORMATION. ONE

03:04:38.100 --> 03:04:40.769
IS THAT DISCLOSED TO HOW MUCH

03:04:40.836 --> 03:04:42.504
MONEY ARE WE ACTUALLY TALKING

03:04:42.571 --> 03:04:45.507
ABOUT? THAT IS TYPICAL. AND

03:04:45.574 --> 03:04:48.310
THREE, DOES THAT NOT COVER EVEN

03:04:48.377 --> 03:04:50.112
IF YOU'RE NOT CALLING IT THE

03:04:50.179 --> 03:04:52.514
DOCUMENT DOCUMENT FEE, BUT

03:04:52.581 --> 03:04:53.982
COVERING THE COST OF DOING

03:04:54.049 --> 03:04:56.118
BUSINESS FOR FOLKS. AND I'LL ASK

03:04:56.185 --> 03:04:58.020
BOTH THE SUPPORT AND THE

03:04:58.086 --> 03:05:00.189
OPPOSITION. LET ME START OFF BY

03:05:00.255 --> 03:05:02.024
SAYING THERE'S WHAT YOU'RE

03:05:02.090 --> 03:05:04.193
REFERRING TO IS THE SALE OF A

03:05:04.259 --> 03:05:05.928
CONDITIONAL SALES CONTRACT,

03:05:05.994 --> 03:05:07.062
WHICH IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL LAW,

03:05:07.129 --> 03:05:10.699
RESILVERING ACT, AND IT'S NOT

03:05:10.766 --> 03:05:12.534
BEING TAKEN UP OR MODIFIED

03:05:12.601 --> 03:05:13.535
ANYWHERE IN THIS BILL. IN TERMS

03:05:13.602 --> 03:05:15.804
OF ALL THE DISCLOSURES THAT HAVE

03:05:15.871 --> 03:05:17.206
TO BE MADE ABOUT ALL OF THAT,

03:05:17.272 --> 03:05:19.174
WHEN AS SOMEBODY WHO WAS A

03:05:19.241 --> 03:05:21.009
BANKER AND PURCHASED A LOT OF

03:05:21.076 --> 03:05:22.911
CONDITIONAL SALES CONTRACTS FROM

03:05:22.978 --> 03:05:26.048
NEW AND USED CAR DEALERS, THOSE

03:05:26.114 --> 03:05:28.584
THOSE RELATIONSHIPS VARY FROM

03:05:28.650 --> 03:05:29.852
CONTRACT TO CONTRACT DEPENDING

03:05:29.918 --> 03:05:31.587
ON THE INTEREST RATE ON THE

03:05:31.653 --> 03:05:34.022
CONTRACT, DEPENDING ON THE

03:05:34.089 --> 03:05:36.558
BUYER'S QUALIFICATIONS IN THE

03:05:36.625 --> 03:05:39.094
FIRST PLACE, THEIR CREDIT

03:05:39.161 --> 03:05:40.963
QUALIFICATIONS AND DEPENDING ON

03:05:41.029 --> 03:05:42.431
THE LENDER AND THE TYPE OF

03:05:42.498 --> 03:05:44.433
LENDER AND FDIC INSURED BANK IS

03:05:44.500 --> 03:05:45.501
GOING TO HAVE A DIFFERENT

03:05:45.567 --> 03:05:46.935
RELATIONSHIP WITH WITH THE WITH

03:05:47.002 --> 03:05:48.103
THE DEALER THAN SOMEONE WHO'S

03:05:48.170 --> 03:05:51.240
NOT. SO THERE'S NOT A SET NUMBER

03:05:51.306 --> 03:05:53.141
THAT, FOR EXAMPLE, WE COULD

03:05:53.208 --> 03:05:54.576
DISCLOSE IN THIS, IN THIS BILL

03:05:54.643 --> 03:05:58.614
PER SE. BUT YOU KNOW, IF WE

03:05:58.680 --> 03:06:00.048
START, I THINK IF WE START GOING

03:06:00.115 --> 03:06:01.717
DOWN THE CHECKLIST OF, YOU KNOW,

03:06:01.783 --> 03:06:04.019
EACH AND EVERY WAY THAT A DEALER

03:06:04.086 --> 03:06:06.922
IS ABLE TO, YOU KNOW, SUSTAIN

03:06:06.989 --> 03:06:08.056
ITSELF OR MAKE SOME MONEY,

03:06:08.123 --> 03:06:10.459
DEPENDING ON WHETHER THEY'RE A

03:06:10.526 --> 03:06:12.127
SMALL USED CAR DEALER OR, YOU

03:06:12.194 --> 03:06:14.363
KNOW, A VERY LARGE NEW CAR

03:06:14.429 --> 03:06:16.198
DEALER, RANGING FROM SERVICE AND

03:06:16.265 --> 03:06:17.566
SERVICE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER

03:06:17.633 --> 03:06:21.837
THINGS. IT WOULD BE BEYOND THE

03:06:21.904 --> 03:06:23.872
SCOPE OF THIS BILL. AND THANK

03:06:23.939 --> 03:06:25.874
YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR QUESTION.

03:06:25.941 --> 03:06:27.342
ASSEMBLY MEMBER CAR DEALERS MAKE

03:06:27.409 --> 03:06:28.844
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PROFITS

03:06:28.911 --> 03:06:33.382
BY SELLING LOANS TO LENDERS. AND

03:06:33.448 --> 03:06:34.883
IT'S CALLED LIKE THE DEALER

03:06:34.950 --> 03:06:37.085
MARKUP DEALER RESERVE DEALER

03:06:37.152 --> 03:06:38.220
PARTICIPATION. IT DOES VARY.

03:06:38.287 --> 03:06:40.956
THAT IS TRUE. THERE HAVE BEEN

03:06:41.023 --> 03:06:44.893
STUDIES DONE BY THE. CONSUMERS

03:06:44.960 --> 03:06:46.562
FOR RESPONSIBLE LENDING, FINDING

03:06:46.628 --> 03:06:48.196
THAT CALIFORNIANS PAY BILLIONS

03:06:48.263 --> 03:06:52.968
OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR IN DEALER

03:06:53.035 --> 03:06:54.236
PARTICIPATION, DEALER RESERVE.

03:06:54.303 --> 03:06:56.805
THAT'S ADDED ON, AND IT'S

03:06:56.872 --> 03:07:00.042
TYPICALLY NOT DISCLOSED. COULD I

03:07:00.108 --> 03:07:02.244
ADD MY OWN EXPERIENCE? AGAIN,

03:07:02.311 --> 03:07:04.379
YOU KNOW, BUYING A CAR IS THE

03:07:04.446 --> 03:07:06.582
MOST OPAQUE CONSUMER TRANSACTION

03:07:06.648 --> 03:07:08.483
THAT EXISTS. THERE'S NOTHING

03:07:08.550 --> 03:07:09.818
LIKE IT. PEOPLE ARE TOTALLY

03:07:09.885 --> 03:07:12.588
BEFUDDLED BY IT. SAME DAY I WAS

03:07:12.654 --> 03:07:14.456
TELLING YOU ABOUT WHEN I WENT TO

03:07:14.523 --> 03:07:15.991
THIS DEALER, I WENT TO ANOTHER

03:07:16.058 --> 03:07:17.059
DEALER AND YOU KNOW, YOU'RE IN

03:07:17.125 --> 03:07:20.228
THE CUBICLE AND THE SALESPERSON

03:07:20.295 --> 03:07:21.964
IS SAYING, WELL, I'M YOUR

03:07:22.030 --> 03:07:23.365
ADVOCATE. I'LL GO TALK TO THE

03:07:23.432 --> 03:07:26.301
SALES MANAGER. I, WE I TOLD HIM

03:07:26.368 --> 03:07:28.570
THE PRICE, THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE

03:07:28.637 --> 03:07:30.072
A MODEST PROFIT. AND THEY'D BE

03:07:30.138 --> 03:07:32.007
I'D BE IN AND OUT OF THERE IN A

03:07:32.074 --> 03:07:33.375
FEW MINUTES. HE COMES BACK AND

03:07:33.442 --> 03:07:35.344
HE SAYS, I TALKED TO MY SALES

03:07:35.410 --> 03:07:37.245
MANAGER. WE WILL AGREE TO THAT

03:07:37.312 --> 03:07:38.246
PRICE IF YOU FINANCE THE CAR

03:07:38.313 --> 03:07:39.681
THROUGH US. OTHERWISE IT'S GOING

03:07:39.748 --> 03:07:42.684
TO BE $1,500 MORE. NOW, THIS WAS

03:07:42.751 --> 03:07:44.019
SEVERAL YEARS AGO. SO RIGHT

03:07:44.086 --> 03:07:45.420
THERE YOU'RE GETTING AN IDEA OF

03:07:45.487 --> 03:07:47.222
THE PROFIT THEY'RE MAKING OFF OF

03:07:47.289 --> 03:07:49.024
DEALER ARRANGED FINANCING. AND I

03:07:49.091 --> 03:07:51.026
KNOW ONE OF THE ITEMS THEY

03:07:51.093 --> 03:07:52.194
MENTIONED IN THE DOCUMENTATION

03:07:52.260 --> 03:07:55.731
FEE REQUEST TO INCREASE IT ARE

03:07:55.797 --> 03:07:57.132
THOSE COSTS. THEY ARE RECOUPING

03:07:57.199 --> 03:07:59.101
THOSE COSTS BECAUSE THEY'RE

03:07:59.167 --> 03:08:02.104
REPLACING LOANS WITH WITH

03:08:02.170 --> 03:08:04.239
LENDERS. GENERALLY THEY'RE THE

03:08:04.306 --> 03:08:05.374
WORST LOANS YOU CAN GET. IF

03:08:05.440 --> 03:08:07.075
YOU'RE SMART, YOU SHOP THE LOAN

03:08:07.142 --> 03:08:08.944
AND YOU DON'T GET IT THROUGH THE

03:08:09.011 --> 03:08:09.978
DEALER. AND NOW THEY WANT TO

03:08:10.045 --> 03:08:11.747
DOUBLE DIP BY SAYING, WELL, GEE,

03:08:11.813 --> 03:08:13.649
WE WANT TO RECOUP THAT COST.

03:08:13.715 --> 03:08:14.249
THEY'RE ALREADY MAKING, IN MY

03:08:14.316 --> 03:08:16.451
CASE, $1,500. AND THIS WAS

03:08:16.518 --> 03:08:17.653
SEVERAL YEARS AGO. IT'S PROBABLY

03:08:17.719 --> 03:08:23.558
MORE LIKE $2,000 TODAY. PLEASE,

03:08:23.625 --> 03:08:27.462
I WILL JUST SAY WE AGREED TO AN

03:08:27.529 --> 03:08:29.765
AMENDMENT AFTER DISCUSSIONS IN

03:08:29.831 --> 03:08:31.733
THE SENATE THAT WE OFTEN CALL

03:08:31.800 --> 03:08:34.803
THE DOUBLE DIPPING AMENDMENT. IT

03:08:34.870 --> 03:08:39.508
IS ILLEGAL NOW UNDER THIS BILL

03:08:39.574 --> 03:08:41.309
TO SEEK TO RECOUP THE COSTS OF

03:08:41.376 --> 03:08:43.045
THE SALES AND LEASE TRANSACTION

03:08:43.111 --> 03:08:44.479
PROCESS THROUGH ANY OTHER

03:08:44.546 --> 03:08:45.580
MECHANISM OTHER THAN THE

03:08:45.647 --> 03:08:48.350
DOCUMENT PROCESSING CHARGE. THIS

03:08:48.417 --> 03:08:50.952
THIS BILL RELATES TO THAT

03:08:51.019 --> 03:08:52.254
PROCESS. HOW WOULD A CONSUMER

03:08:52.320 --> 03:08:56.358
PROVE THAT? HOW HOW WOULD A

03:08:56.425 --> 03:08:59.327
CONSUMER PROVE THAT THE GENERAL

03:08:59.394 --> 03:09:00.762
MARKUP, WHICH IS DIFFERENT FOR

03:09:00.829 --> 03:09:04.499
EVERY RETAILER, DOES NOT INCLUDE

03:09:04.566 --> 03:09:06.034
AN ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL MARKUP

03:09:06.101 --> 03:09:08.336
RELATED TO THIS? THAT'S WHAT I'M

03:09:08.403 --> 03:09:10.338
TRYING TO GET AT IN MY QUESTIONS

03:09:10.405 --> 03:09:11.873
IS TO PARSE OUT, ARE WE

03:09:11.940 --> 03:09:14.342
INCREASING THE DOCUMENT FEE

03:09:14.409 --> 03:09:18.413
BECAUSE WE CAN ON CONSUMERS

03:09:18.480 --> 03:09:20.115
BECAUSE WE CAN JUSTIFY IT. BUT

03:09:20.182 --> 03:09:22.050
AS MY COLLEAGUE NOTED, AT A TIME

03:09:22.117 --> 03:09:22.984
WHERE CONSUMERS ARE REALLY

03:09:23.051 --> 03:09:24.786
STRUGGLING, OR ARE WE INCREASING

03:09:24.853 --> 03:09:26.722
THE DOCUMENT FEE TO RECOVER

03:09:26.788 --> 03:09:29.224
COSTS BECAUSE DEALERS ARE JUST

03:09:29.291 --> 03:09:30.759
RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF HAVING TO

03:09:30.826 --> 03:09:32.060
CLOSE THEIR DOORS IN EVERY

03:09:32.127 --> 03:09:34.329
LITTLE BIT? IS GOING TO MATTER,

03:09:34.396 --> 03:09:36.264
AND HOW WOULD WE KNOW IT WOULD

03:09:36.331 --> 03:09:37.332
BE THE LATTER, THAT EVERY LITTLE

03:09:37.399 --> 03:09:39.167
BIT MATTERS? AND I WILL JUST

03:09:39.234 --> 03:09:41.069
TELL YOU THAT WHILE WE OFTEN

03:09:41.136 --> 03:09:43.538
HEAR ABOUT NARRATIVES ABOUT

03:09:43.605 --> 03:09:45.474
DEALER, YOU KNOW, BILLION, YOU

03:09:45.540 --> 03:09:47.342
KNOW, YOU HEAR THE WORD BILLION,

03:09:47.409 --> 03:09:49.845
BILLION, BILLION. I WILL JUST

03:09:49.911 --> 03:09:51.146
TELL YOU THIS. THE CLIENT I

03:09:51.213 --> 03:09:52.180
REPRESENT, THE CALIFORNIA NEW

03:09:52.247 --> 03:09:54.983
CAR DEALERS ASSOCIATION, HAS

03:09:55.050 --> 03:09:57.519
1200 NEW CAR DEALERS THROUGHOUT

03:09:57.586 --> 03:10:00.322
THE STATE. IF WE SUGGEST HERE

03:10:00.388 --> 03:10:02.257
THAT SOMEHOW ALL OF THOSE

03:10:02.324 --> 03:10:03.692
ENTITIES ARE DOING SO GREAT

03:10:03.759 --> 03:10:05.160
RIGHT NOW, THAT WOULD BE FLAT

03:10:05.227 --> 03:10:08.063
OUT FALSE. IT IS. IT IS A

03:10:08.130 --> 03:10:09.464
STRUGGLE TO DO BUSINESS IN THE

03:10:09.531 --> 03:10:11.299
STATE OF CALIFORNIA, REGARDLESS

03:10:11.366 --> 03:10:14.069
OF WHAT BUSINESS YOU HAVE. NOW,

03:10:14.136 --> 03:10:15.871
I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT WE HAVE

03:10:15.937 --> 03:10:17.839
TO COME TO THE LEGISLATURE TO

03:10:17.906 --> 03:10:19.508
SAVE US, BUT WHAT I AM SAYING IS

03:10:19.574 --> 03:10:20.909
THE DEALERS HAVE NOT BEEN

03:10:20.976 --> 03:10:22.544
RECOVERING THEIR COSTS FOR MANY,

03:10:22.611 --> 03:10:24.112
MANY YEARS, AND THAT IS WELL

03:10:24.179 --> 03:10:25.647
DOCUMENTED GIVEN THE CHARGE HAS

03:10:25.714 --> 03:10:27.816
BEEN STUCK AT THE LOWEST LEVEL

03:10:27.883 --> 03:10:30.051
IN THE NATION FOR MANY YEARS,

03:10:30.118 --> 03:10:31.386
DESPITE HAVING THE MOST

03:10:31.453 --> 03:10:33.255
OBLIGATIONS. AND SO WE ARE HERE

03:10:33.321 --> 03:10:34.689
ASKING FOR A FAIR SHAKE. AND

03:10:34.756 --> 03:10:37.225
THAT IS IT. FROM THERE, IF THE

03:10:37.292 --> 03:10:38.560
DEALERS ARE, IF THEY'RE THERE, A

03:10:38.627 --> 03:10:41.029
SINGLE SOURCE, YOU KNOW, SHOPS

03:10:41.096 --> 03:10:42.197
THAT ARE STRUGGLING, THEN

03:10:42.264 --> 03:10:43.398
THEY'RE STRUGGLING, YOU KNOW,

03:10:43.465 --> 03:10:45.100
AND THAT WOULD BE UNFORTUNATE.

03:10:45.167 --> 03:10:46.568
BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS,

03:10:46.635 --> 03:10:48.236
IF WE'RE ALL IN AGREEMENT THAT

03:10:48.303 --> 03:10:50.238
IT IS FUNDAMENTAL TO BE ABLE TO

03:10:50.305 --> 03:10:51.273
RECOVER YOUR COST OF DOING

03:10:51.339 --> 03:10:53.475
BUSINESS, THIS IS THE WAY WE

03:10:53.542 --> 03:10:54.409
HAVE TO DO IT. OTHERWISE WE

03:10:54.476 --> 03:10:56.611
WOULDN'T BE HERE TODAY. ALL

03:10:56.678 --> 03:10:58.013
RIGHT. I COULD APPRECIATE IT.

03:10:58.079 --> 03:11:00.982
WHAT WHAT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT

03:11:01.049 --> 03:11:02.117
IS FEELING LIKE WE ARE NICKEL

03:11:02.184 --> 03:11:05.954
AND DIMING CONSUMERS. AS WAS

03:11:06.021 --> 03:11:07.422
MENTIONED, WE CAN'T DISCUSS A

03:11:07.489 --> 03:11:09.057
PHASE IN. BUT I'D BE INTERESTED

03:11:09.124 --> 03:11:11.059
IN TALKING TO YOU ABOUT THAT

03:11:11.126 --> 03:11:13.728
AFTER THE FACT. WE'LL SEE WHERE

03:11:13.795 --> 03:11:16.364
WE GO FROM HERE. THANK YOU. ALL

03:11:16.431 --> 03:11:18.300
RIGHT. I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER

03:11:18.366 --> 03:11:21.369
HART HAS DECLINED TO SPEAK. IS

03:11:21.436 --> 03:11:23.872
THERE ANY OTHERS BEFORE WE MOVE

03:11:23.939 --> 03:11:26.408
ON? OKAY. FIRST OF ALL, THANK

03:11:26.474 --> 03:11:29.611
YOU TO THE SENATOR FOR WORKING

03:11:29.678 --> 03:11:31.513
WITH MY COMMITTEE AND ON

03:11:31.580 --> 03:11:33.081
AMENDMENTS TO INCREASE

03:11:33.148 --> 03:11:35.517
TRANSPARENCY AROUND THE DOCUMENT

03:11:35.584 --> 03:11:37.085
FEE. IT'S BEEN NEARLY A DECADE

03:11:37.152 --> 03:11:39.087
SINCE CALIFORNIA LAST RAISED THE

03:11:39.154 --> 03:11:41.256
FEE, AND I DO BELIEVE IT'S

03:11:41.323 --> 03:11:41.890
IMPORTANT TO DEALERSHIPS TO BE

03:11:41.957 --> 03:11:43.358
ABLE TO REDUCE THEIR COSTS,

03:11:43.425 --> 03:11:45.594
RECOUP THEIR COSTS DURING

03:11:45.660 --> 03:11:47.362
TRANSACTIONS. I NOTED THAT MY

03:11:47.429 --> 03:11:49.130
LAST VEHICLE PURCHASE, THE LAST

03:11:49.197 --> 03:11:52.067
TWO, HAPPENED TO BE CASH AND THE

03:11:52.133 --> 03:11:54.002
SAME AMOUNT OF PAPERWORK. I WAS

03:11:54.069 --> 03:11:55.503
REALLY EXCITED TO FINALLY COME

03:11:55.570 --> 03:11:56.404
INTO A DEALERSHIP AND PAY CASH

03:11:56.471 --> 03:11:58.240
FOR A VEHICLE VERSUS A LOAN. AND

03:11:58.306 --> 03:12:00.408
I NOTICED THAT I DID THE SAME

03:12:00.475 --> 03:12:02.944
EXACT PAPERWORK TO BE ABLE TO

03:12:03.011 --> 03:12:05.080
PAY CASH. SO IT WAS THE SAME

03:12:05.146 --> 03:12:05.981
PROCESS, AND IT WAS FRUSTRATING

03:12:06.047 --> 03:12:07.883
BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO

03:12:07.949 --> 03:12:09.684
SAVE SOME TIME AND WE DID NOT.

03:12:09.751 --> 03:12:11.019
AND SO THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE

03:12:11.086 --> 03:12:12.520
WORKED ON, WHICH WERE TAKEN BY

03:12:12.587 --> 03:12:14.589
YOUR OFFICE, CONSUMERS WILL BE

03:12:14.656 --> 03:12:16.524
AWARE OF THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT THAT

03:12:16.591 --> 03:12:17.859
THEY COULD BE CHARGED FOR A

03:12:17.926 --> 03:12:20.061
DOCUMENT FEE. IT WILL BE CLEARLY

03:12:20.128 --> 03:12:21.496
DISCLOSED TO THE CONSUMER

03:12:21.563 --> 03:12:25.767
SEVERAL TIMES PRIOR TO PURCHASE,

03:12:25.834 --> 03:12:28.403
THAT THIS DOCUMENT FEE HAS A NOT

03:12:28.470 --> 03:12:30.105
TO EXCEED AN AMOUNT, SO

03:12:30.171 --> 03:12:32.240
THEREFORE UP TO. AND IT'S ALSO

03:12:32.307 --> 03:12:34.776
NOT A GOVERNMENT FEE. AND SO

03:12:34.843 --> 03:12:36.344
WITH THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING

03:12:36.411 --> 03:12:38.179
YOUR BILL TODAY. I'LL GIVE YOU

03:12:38.246 --> 03:12:39.948
AN OPPORTUNITY TO CLOSE I THINK

03:12:40.015 --> 03:12:42.517
WE OR NO WE DIDN'T DID WE. ALL

03:12:42.584 --> 03:12:47.122
RIGHT I WILL ENTERTAIN ENTERTAIN

03:12:47.188 --> 03:12:51.359
A MOTION. IT'S BEEN MOVED BY

03:12:51.426 --> 03:12:52.861
AGUIAR-CURRY AND SECONDED BY

03:12:52.928 --> 03:12:56.231
MACEDO. SENATOR, PLEASE. THANK

03:12:56.298 --> 03:12:57.465
YOU, MADAM CHAIR. AGAIN, ALL

03:12:57.532 --> 03:12:59.801
THAT WORK THAT YOU JUST OUTLINED

03:12:59.868 --> 03:13:03.204
IS VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. LET ME

03:13:03.271 --> 03:13:05.140
I DO WANT TO SPEAK VERY BRIEFLY

03:13:05.206 --> 03:13:07.075
AND QUICKLY TO SOME OF THE

03:13:07.142 --> 03:13:07.876
IMPORTANT MEMBER COMMENTS,

03:13:07.943 --> 03:13:08.877
BECAUSE I DO APPRECIATE THE

03:13:08.944 --> 03:13:11.179
ROBUST DISCUSSION. AND WE'VE

03:13:11.246 --> 03:13:13.081
BEEN I THINK ANYTIME WE'VE HAD A

03:13:13.148 --> 03:13:14.082
LOT OF ROBUST DISCUSSIONS ON A

03:13:14.149 --> 03:13:16.184
BILL, YOU APPRECIATE IT WHEN YOU

03:13:16.251 --> 03:13:17.285
GET TO COMMITTEE. AND THERE'S

03:13:17.352 --> 03:13:18.987
MORE OF THAT BECAUSE IT MAKES

03:13:19.054 --> 03:13:20.155
YOU FEEL LIKE PEOPLE ARE ENGAGED

03:13:20.221 --> 03:13:22.257
AND THIS REALLY MEANS SOMETHING.

03:13:22.324 --> 03:13:24.492
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS

03:13:24.559 --> 03:13:26.628
I HAVE STARTING FROM DAY ONE

03:13:26.695 --> 03:13:29.097
WITH WITH THE SPONSORS ABOUT

03:13:29.164 --> 03:13:30.899
INDEXING, MAINLY BECAUSE IF YOU

03:13:30.966 --> 03:13:33.802
LOOK BACK, AS THE CHAIR SAID,

03:13:33.868 --> 03:13:35.303
TEN YEARS TO SEE THE LAST

03:13:35.370 --> 03:13:36.371
INCREASE, WHICH WAS FIVE BUCKS,

03:13:36.438 --> 03:13:39.174
YOU HAD TO GO A LONG WAY BACK TO

03:13:39.240 --> 03:13:41.776
SEE WHEN THE $80 CAME IN. YEARS

03:13:41.843 --> 03:13:43.345
AND YEARS AND YEARS BEFORE THAT.

03:13:43.411 --> 03:13:44.713
AND IT OCCURRED, IT OCCURRED TO

03:13:44.779 --> 03:13:46.047
ME JUST AS A BUSINESS

03:13:46.114 --> 03:13:47.515
PROPOSITION AND A POLICY

03:13:47.582 --> 03:13:48.984
PROPOSITION, THAT HAD THEY

03:13:49.050 --> 03:13:51.052
INDEXED IT TO COST OF LIVING

03:13:51.119 --> 03:13:52.988
INDEX PER REGION AT THAT TIME,

03:13:53.054 --> 03:13:54.389
WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE HERE

03:13:54.456 --> 03:13:56.224
TODAY AT ALL. I THINK THAT'S

03:13:56.291 --> 03:13:57.392
PART OF WHAT MY SPONSOR WAS

03:13:57.459 --> 03:13:59.761
TRYING TO SAY IN EARLIER Q&amp;A. WE

03:13:59.828 --> 03:14:01.229
WOULDN'T BE HERE IF THAT WAS THE

03:14:01.296 --> 03:14:02.964
CASE, BUT WE'RE STUCK. WE'VE

03:14:03.031 --> 03:14:04.733
BEEN STUCK WITH THIS FLAT FEE

03:14:04.799 --> 03:14:06.234
SCENARIO WHERE YOU HAVE TO COME

03:14:06.301 --> 03:14:08.036
BACK. THERE'S NEVER GOING TO BE

03:14:08.103 --> 03:14:10.105
A GREAT TIME TO DO THAT. THIS IS

03:14:10.171 --> 03:14:11.873
A TIME WHEN PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO

03:14:11.940 --> 03:14:13.908
PUT A HALF CENT SALES TAX ON THE

03:14:13.975 --> 03:14:15.844
SAME CONSUMERS I REPRESENT IN

03:14:15.910 --> 03:14:16.845
THE BAY AREA FOR TRANSPORTATION

03:14:16.911 --> 03:14:20.648
PURPOSES, AND SUPPOSEDLY THAT'S

03:14:20.715 --> 03:14:22.450
NOT A PROBLEM IN TERMS IN TERMS

03:14:22.517 --> 03:14:28.556
OF AFFORDABILITY. THIS, THIS, I

03:14:28.623 --> 03:14:32.060
THINK, ALWAYS HAS HAD ROOM, NOT

03:14:32.127 --> 03:14:33.928
TODAY, BECAUSE THE CHAIR HELPED

03:14:33.995 --> 03:14:36.131
US STRUCTURE A GREAT FRAMEWORK,

03:14:36.197 --> 03:14:37.899
BUT HAS ALWAYS HAD ROOM FOR

03:14:37.966 --> 03:14:40.802
INDEXING. AGAIN, IN IN ONE VALUE

03:14:40.869 --> 03:14:41.970
TO THAT WOULD BE MAKING SURE WE

03:14:42.037 --> 03:14:43.805
DON'T EVER HAVE TO COME BACK

03:14:43.872 --> 03:14:45.373
AGAIN AND HAVE THIS KIND OF A

03:14:45.440 --> 03:14:46.474
DISCUSSION. THE PROBLEM IS,

03:14:46.541 --> 03:14:47.942
DEALERS AND THE SPONSORS HERE

03:14:48.009 --> 03:14:49.110
AND THE COMMITTEES THAT HAVE

03:14:49.177 --> 03:14:50.578
WORKED ON THIS HAVE BASICALLY

03:14:50.645 --> 03:14:54.015
COME UP WITH A SCENARIO WHICH

03:14:54.082 --> 03:14:56.317
SAYS, LET'S JUST CAP IT BECAUSE

03:14:56.384 --> 03:14:58.787
THAT'S WHAT'S FAIR, AND USE A

03:14:58.853 --> 03:15:02.290
PERCENTAGE INSTEAD TO ACHIEVE,

03:15:02.357 --> 03:15:04.225
IN EFFECT, WHAT WE WOULD WITH A

03:15:04.292 --> 03:15:07.262
COLA AS, AS, AS A PRICE OF

03:15:07.328 --> 03:15:09.164
VEHICLES CHANGES THE PRICE OF

03:15:09.230 --> 03:15:11.833
PURCHASES CHANGE. THE 1% TRACKS

03:15:11.900 --> 03:15:16.704
THAT, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT $8,500

03:15:16.771 --> 03:15:19.040
CAR, THE $8,000 CAR IS ACTUALLY

03:15:19.107 --> 03:15:20.742
LESS UNDER THIS BILL ON A

03:15:20.809 --> 03:15:22.477
DOCUMENT FEE THAN IT WOULD HAVE

03:15:22.544 --> 03:15:26.147
BEEN BEFORE THE BILL. SO, YOU

03:15:26.214 --> 03:15:27.916
KNOW, WE'VE TRIED TO CREATE A

03:15:27.982 --> 03:15:29.184
MECHANISM. SO YOU GAIN SOMETHING

03:15:29.250 --> 03:15:30.752
BY INDEXING, YOU LOSE SOMETHING

03:15:30.819 --> 03:15:32.987
BY INDEXING, BECAUSE WITH

03:15:33.054 --> 03:15:34.823
INDEXING, PRESUMABLY THE 350

03:15:34.889 --> 03:15:36.658
WOULD JUST KEEP GOING UP AND UP

03:15:36.724 --> 03:15:38.026
AND WHO KNOWS WHEN IT WOULD EVER

03:15:38.093 --> 03:15:40.028
BE REVIEWED BY THE LEGISLATURE.

03:15:40.095 --> 03:15:41.963
SO WE, WE, WE FEEL LIKE WE'VE

03:15:42.030 --> 03:15:44.899
DONE A GOOD JOB, A GREAT JOB

03:15:44.966 --> 03:15:46.701
JUST TO GET THIS FRAMEWORK AND

03:15:46.768 --> 03:15:48.236
THIS MODEL HERE. BUT I WANT TO

03:15:48.303 --> 03:15:50.138
SAY AS AN AUTHOR, I'M MORE THAN

03:15:50.205 --> 03:15:52.006
HAPPY TO CONTINUE THE

03:15:52.073 --> 03:15:53.408
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHETHER

03:15:53.475 --> 03:15:55.877
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT INDEXING

03:15:55.944 --> 03:15:57.278
ALL OR PART OF THIS THAT THAT

03:15:57.345 --> 03:16:00.181
MAKES SOME SENSE DOWN THE ROAD.

03:16:00.248 --> 03:16:02.283
AND IF YOU DO THAT, YOU WILL BE

03:16:02.350 --> 03:16:03.284

VERY RELUCTANT TO DO THAT. I

03:16:09.224 --> 03:16:11.860
LOOK, I THINK WE'VE REACHED

03:16:11.926 --> 03:16:15.363
AFTER MONTHS OF DISCUSSION WHERE

03:16:15.430 --> 03:16:19.067
WE WANT TO BE ON THIS, AND THAT

03:16:19.134 --> 03:16:20.668
DOESN'T MEAN MY DOOR IS CLOSED.

03:16:20.735 --> 03:16:22.070
THAT'S ALL I'M TRYING TO SAY. MY

03:16:22.137 --> 03:16:24.072

03:16:24.139 --> 03:16:28.409
COURSE. WE'LL CONTINUE TO WORK

03:16:28.476 --> 03:16:30.912
WITH OPPOSITION AND, YOU KNOW,

03:16:30.979 --> 03:16:33.481

03:16:33.548 --> 03:16:35.350
CONCERNS THAT, YOU KNOW, ARE

03:16:35.416 --> 03:16:36.351
NUANCED BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE

03:16:36.417 --> 03:16:39.854
SURE THAT IS NOT THE CASE IF WE

03:16:39.921 --> 03:16:41.756
CAN AVOID IT. MADAM CHAIR, I'LL

03:16:41.823 --> 03:16:43.558
WRAP UP IN JUST A SECOND AND

03:16:43.625 --> 03:16:47.162
JUST SAY, I, I APPRECIATE THE

03:16:47.228 --> 03:16:48.863
DISCUSSION. AGAIN, I WANT TO

03:16:48.930 --> 03:16:50.365
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT

03:16:50.431 --> 03:16:52.467
CONFLATING THINGS THAT REALLY

03:16:52.534 --> 03:16:56.571
AREN'T AFFORDABILITY ISSUES.

03:16:56.638 --> 03:17:00.408
LIKE. WHATEVER A DEALER'S

03:17:00.475 --> 03:17:02.544
ARRANGEMENT IS WITH A BANKER

03:17:02.610 --> 03:17:06.915
AFTER THEY HAVE REACHED THE

CONDITIONAL SALES CONTRACT AND

SHOULD ALLEVIATE ANY CONCERNS

03:24:10.738 --> 03:24:12.773
RELATED TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS

03:24:12.840 --> 03:24:16.043
BILL SEEKS TO UPEND ANY PREVIOUS

03:24:16.110 --> 03:24:17.445
RULINGS. THE BILL ESTABLISHES

03:24:17.511 --> 03:24:19.914
THE TERM ACTION TO MEAN THAT THE

03:24:19.981 --> 03:24:21.482
ADOPTION OR AMENDMENT OF A RULE

03:24:21.549 --> 03:24:23.684

03:24:28.422 --> 03:24:30.391
POLLUTION ASSOCIATED WITH THE

03:24:30.458 --> 03:24:32.226

THIS BILL WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT

03:24:34.462 --> 03:24:37.732
UNTIL JANUARY 1ST, 2031, INSTEAD

03:24:37.798 --> 03:24:41.035
OF 2036. I BELIEVE THAT THIS

03:24:41.102 --> 03:24:43.004
BILL STRIKES A BALANCE. IT DEALS

03:24:43.070 --> 03:24:45.506

WHICH IDENTIFIED PORT POLLUTION

03:29:25.753 --> 03:29:27.021
AS A KEY CONCERN IN ITS

03:29:27.087 --> 03:29:28.289
COMMUNITY EMISSION REDUCTIONS

03:29:31.792 --> 03:29:33.327

COMMITTEE HEARING, WHICH WAS,

03:29:35.462 --> 03:29:37.431
WHAT WAS THE BEEF WITH THIS

03:29:37.498 --> 03:29:39.266
BILL? WELL, IMAGINE THIS THERE

03:29:39.333 --> 03:29:41.168
IS A POLLUTER IN YOUR COMMUNITY.

03:29:41.235 --> 03:29:42.670
WELL, IT'S NOT THE ONLY

03:29:42.736 --> 03:29:44.004
POLLUTION SOURCE NEARBY. IT IS

03:29:44.071 --> 03:29:45.906
THE LARGEST EMITTER OF POLLUTION

03:29:45.973 --> 03:29:47.207
IN THE REGION. BOTH YOU AND YOUR

03:29:47.274 --> 03:29:48.709
NEIGHBORS HAVE COLLECTIVELY

03:29:48.776 --> 03:29:49.977
SPENT DECADES WORKING TO CLEAN

03:29:50.044 --> 03:29:52.346
IT UP. AND JUST AS THE AIR

03:29:52.413 --> 03:29:53.480
DISTRICT IS CONSIDERING HOW TO

03:29:53.547 --> 03:29:54.882
REDUCE EMISSIONS FROM THAT

03:29:54.949 --> 03:29:56.317
SOURCE, A NEW STATE LAW FROM THE

03:29:56.383 --> 03:29:58.519
STATE CAPITOL TIES THAT AGENCY'S

03:29:58.585 --> 03:30:01.221
HANDS. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT SB

03:30:01.288 --> 03:30:03.724
34 PROPOSES TO DO. THAT IS THE

03:30:03.791 --> 03:30:06.026
BEEF WITH THIS BILL. WE

03:30:06.093 --> 03:30:07.061
APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT

03:30:07.127 --> 03:30:08.595
HAVE NARROWED THE SCOPE OF THE

03:30:08.662 --> 03:30:10.230
BILL. WE BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT

03:30:10.297 --> 03:30:10.764
THE LANGUAGE BARRING THE

03:30:10.831 --> 03:30:12.099
DISTRICT FROM IMPOSING A CARGO

03:30:12.166 --> 03:30:13.934
CAP STILL INVITES AMBIGUITY AND

03:30:14.001 --> 03:30:16.136
LITIGATION FROM OPPONENTS. EVEN

03:30:16.203 --> 03:30:18.272
THEN, SB 34 SENDS A CLEAR AND

03:30:18.339 --> 03:30:19.640
CONCERNING MESSAGE THAT THE

03:30:19.707 --> 03:30:21.475
STATE LEGISLATURE WILL PROTECT

03:30:21.542 --> 03:30:23.277
THE LARGEST SOURCE OF POLLUTION

03:30:23.344 --> 03:30:26.480
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SB 34 IS

03:30:26.547 --> 03:30:27.715
OFTEN PORTRAYED AS A DISTRICT

03:30:27.781 --> 03:30:29.483
BILL, BUT ITS RAMIFICATIONS GO

03:30:29.550 --> 03:30:31.318
FAR BEYOND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

03:30:31.385 --> 03:30:33.287
IF SUCCESSFUL, IT WILL PROVIDE,

03:30:33.354 --> 03:30:34.788
PROVIDE, PROVIDE A ROADMAP FOR

03:30:34.855 --> 03:30:36.457
THE POLLUTER LOBBY TO SHIELD

03:30:36.523 --> 03:30:37.958
THEMSELVES FROM PUBLIC INTEREST

03:30:38.025 --> 03:30:40.427
RULEMAKING. MOREOVER, IT WOULD

03:30:40.494 --> 03:30:42.363
CLOSE OFF YET ANOTHER PATH TO

03:30:42.429 --> 03:30:43.864
BRINGING CLEAN AIR TO THE

03:30:43.931 --> 03:30:45.165
SMOGGIEST REGION IN CALIFORNIA.

03:30:45.232 --> 03:30:46.567
THE SMOGGIEST REGION IN THE

03:30:46.633 --> 03:30:48.869
COUNTRY CONTINUALLY FAILING TO

03:30:48.936 --> 03:30:49.837
MEET FEDERAL AIR QUALITY

03:30:49.903 --> 03:30:52.373
STANDARDS HAS CONSEQUENCES.

03:30:52.439 --> 03:30:53.440
CURRENTLY, THESE CONSEQUENCES

03:30:53.507 --> 03:30:54.875
ARE SUBSIDIZED BY FAMILIES,

03:30:54.942 --> 03:30:57.111
MEDICAL BILLS, TAXPAYER DOLLARS,

03:30:57.177 --> 03:30:58.879
AND HEALTH. BUT THESE

03:30:58.946 --> 03:30:59.880
CONSEQUENCES CAN IMPACT

03:30:59.947 --> 03:31:01.415
CALIFORNIA'S TRANSPORTATION

03:31:01.482 --> 03:31:02.850
SYSTEM TO THE FEDERAL

03:31:02.916 --> 03:31:04.651
GOVERNMENT. CAN WITHDRAW OR

03:31:04.718 --> 03:31:06.086
WITHHOLD FEDERAL HIGHWAY FUNDING

03:31:06.153 --> 03:31:07.921
FOR FAILING TO MEET AIR QUALITY

03:31:07.988 --> 03:31:09.256
STANDARDS. IN FACT, IT ALMOST

03:31:09.323 --> 03:31:11.592
PULLED THAT TRIGGER BACK IN

03:31:11.658 --> 03:31:14.161
2019. PLEASE FINISH UP. TO

03:31:14.228 --> 03:31:16.563
CONCLUDE, I OFFER THIS CLEAN AIR

03:31:16.630 --> 03:31:18.365
IS NOT A NICE TO HAVE. IT'S A

03:31:18.432 --> 03:31:20.534
LIFE OR DEATH SITUATION. THE ZIP

SHORTER THAN THAT IN WEST LONG

PLEASE VOTE NO ON SB 34. OKAY,

03:31:43.957 --> 03:31:47.461
YOU CAN PROCEED. THANK YOU.

03:31:47.528 --> 03:31:48.962
COMMITTEE CHAIR. HELLO,

03:31:49.029 --> 03:31:50.697
COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS

03:31:50.764 --> 03:31:52.166
WAYNE NASTRI. I'M THE EXECUTIVE

03:31:52.232 --> 03:31:54.068
OFFICER OF THE SOUTH COAST AIR

03:31:54.134 --> 03:31:55.269
QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT, AND

03:31:55.335 --> 03:31:58.272
WE STRONGLY OPPOSE SB 34. THE

03:31:58.338 --> 03:31:59.740
BILL CIRCUMVENTS THE LOCAL

03:31:59.807 --> 03:32:01.241
PUBLIC PROCESS AND INTRODUCES

03:32:01.308 --> 03:32:03.544
LEGAL AMBIGUITY AND JEOPARDIZES

03:32:03.610 --> 03:32:05.145
OUR ABILITY TO REGULATE

03:32:05.212 --> 03:32:06.213
EMISSIONS FROM THE LARGEST

03:32:06.280 --> 03:32:07.915
SOURCE OF POLLUTION IN OUR

03:32:07.981 --> 03:32:09.917
REGION AND THE ENTIRE STATE,

03:32:09.983 --> 03:32:10.884
THAT BEING THE PORTS OF LOS

03:32:10.951 --> 03:32:12.786
ANGELES AND LONG BEACH. AND

03:32:12.853 --> 03:32:14.521
WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE

03:32:14.588 --> 03:32:15.489
AMENDMENTS, WE STILL HAVE

03:32:15.556 --> 03:32:19.126
SEVERAL CONCERNS. SB 34 SETS A

03:32:19.193 --> 03:32:20.928
DANGEROUS PRECEDENT. THE BILL

03:32:20.994 --> 03:32:23.097
WOULD ALLOW A SINGLE INDUSTRY TO

03:32:23.163 --> 03:32:24.898
BYPASS A LOCAL AUTHORITY AND

03:32:24.965 --> 03:32:26.266
SETTING A PRECEDENT THAT

03:32:26.333 --> 03:32:27.835
UNDERMINES ENVIRONMENTAL

03:32:27.901 --> 03:32:29.203
PROTECTIONS AND WEAKENS

03:32:29.269 --> 03:32:31.004
REGULATORY ACCOUNTABILITY

03:32:31.071 --> 03:32:33.040
STATEWIDE. IT ALSO UNDERMINES

03:32:33.107 --> 03:32:34.975
THE LOCAL COLLABORATIVE PROCESS,

03:32:35.042 --> 03:32:36.410
WHERE WE'VE SPENT OVER EIGHT

03:32:36.477 --> 03:32:38.178
YEARS NEGOTIATING WITH PORTS,

03:32:38.245 --> 03:32:40.380
LABOR, INDUSTRY, LOCAL

03:32:40.447 --> 03:32:41.882
GOVERNMENTS AND COMMUNITIES TO

03:32:41.949 --> 03:32:44.751
DEVELOP EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS

03:32:44.818 --> 03:32:45.385
ALIGNED WITH THE PORTS CLEAN AIR

03:32:45.452 --> 03:32:49.356
ACTION PLANS. SB 34 STILL

03:32:49.423 --> 03:32:51.091
CREATES LEGAL UNCERTAINTY, AND

03:32:51.158 --> 03:32:52.826
THE PHRASE THE BILL PROHIBITING

03:32:52.893 --> 03:32:55.562
A CAP ON CARGO THROUGHPUT IS

03:32:55.629 --> 03:32:56.930
UNDEFINED AND AMBIGUOUS. IT

03:32:56.997 --> 03:32:58.765
COULD BE INTERPRETED TO BLOCK

03:32:58.832 --> 03:33:00.868
ANY RULE THAT REDUCES EMISSIONS

03:33:00.934 --> 03:33:02.736
IF IT'S VIEWED AS INDIRECTLY

03:33:02.803 --> 03:33:05.272
AFFECTING CARGO MOVEMENT. EVEN

03:33:05.339 --> 03:33:06.974
RULES SUPPORTING CLEAN

03:33:07.040 --> 03:33:09.143
INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS AMBIGUITY

03:33:09.209 --> 03:33:10.711
COULD OPEN THE DOOR TO

03:33:10.777 --> 03:33:12.713
LITIGATION AND DELAY RULEMAKING

03:33:12.779 --> 03:33:14.548
FOR ANY ACTION THAT PORT RELATED

03:33:14.615 --> 03:33:16.617
EMISSIONS AND ENTITIES DISLIKE.

03:33:16.683 --> 03:33:18.452
BY CLAIMING THAT IT IMPOSES A

03:33:18.519 --> 03:33:21.421
CAP, SB 34 ALSO INCREASES THE

03:33:21.488 --> 03:33:22.823
RISK OF FEDERAL SANCTIONS UNDER

03:33:22.890 --> 03:33:25.759
THE CLEAN AIR ACT, POTENTIALLY

03:33:25.826 --> 03:33:27.127
INCLUDING THE LOSS OF BILLIONS

03:33:27.194 --> 03:33:28.629
OF DOLLARS IN FEDERAL HIGHWAY

03:33:28.695 --> 03:33:32.332
FUNDS. IN SOME, SB 34 WEAKENS

03:33:32.399 --> 03:33:34.768
LOCAL AUTHORITY, THREATENS OUR

03:33:34.835 --> 03:33:35.903
ECONOMY, AND UNDERMINES CLEAN

03:33:35.969 --> 03:33:37.704

03:33:37.771 --> 03:33:40.607

THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT

03:36:46.593 --> 03:36:48.628

03:36:48.695 --> 03:36:50.197
SO. WE HAVE BOTH SIDES. SO I'D

03:36:50.263 --> 03:36:53.800
LIKE TO HAVE A. ANSWERED OF ONE

03:36:53.867 --> 03:36:56.069
WAY OR THE OTHER. WHAT PLAN DO

03:36:56.136 --> 03:36:58.472
YOU HAVE IN PLACE TO MEET YOUR

03:36:58.538 --> 03:36:59.806
ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS AND AVOID

03:36:59.873 --> 03:37:01.375
IMPACTS TO EMPLOYEES. AND WHERE

03:37:01.441 --> 03:37:04.511
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE, WHAT ARE WE

03:37:04.578 --> 03:37:05.078
GOING TO DO ABOUT DISPLACED

03:37:05.145 --> 03:37:09.216

03:37:09.282 --> 03:37:12.753
FIRST OR GO AHEAD, NO, GO AHEAD

03:37:12.819 --> 03:37:16.256
AND I'LL RESPOND. I'M SORRY.

03:37:16.323 --> 03:37:18.358
COULD YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION?

03:37:18.425 --> 03:37:20.394
WHAT PLAN DO YOU HAVE IN PLACE

03:37:20.460 --> 03:37:22.262
TO MEET YOUR ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS

03:37:22.329 --> 03:37:23.830
AND TO AVOID IMPACTS TO

03:37:23.897 --> 03:37:26.199
EMPLOYEES? AND WHERE THAT'S NOT

03:37:26.266 --> 03:37:27.033
POSSIBLE, WHAT DO WE DO TO

03:37:27.100 --> 03:37:29.136
PROVIDE FOR DISPLACED WORKERS?

03:37:29.202 --> 03:37:31.304
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. SO

03:37:31.371 --> 03:37:33.707
THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

03:37:33.774 --> 03:37:36.610
ESTABLISHES THE STANDARDS FOR

03:37:36.676 --> 03:37:37.978
CLEAN AIR, THE NATIONAL AMBIENT

03:37:38.044 --> 03:37:40.414
AIR QUALITY STANDARDS RIGHT NOW,

03:37:40.480 --> 03:37:41.681
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, THE SOUTH

03:37:41.748 --> 03:37:45.218
COAST REGION, HAS THE WORST AIR

03:37:45.285 --> 03:37:46.486
QUALITY IN THE NATION. IT'S

03:37:46.553 --> 03:37:48.855
EXTREME NON-ATTAINMENT. AND SO

03:37:48.922 --> 03:37:51.358
THE PRESCRIPTIVE MEASURES THAT

03:37:51.425 --> 03:37:53.126
WE HAVE TO TAKE PLACE ARE MUCH

03:37:53.193 --> 03:37:54.194
MORE STRINGENT THAN ANYWHERE

03:37:54.261 --> 03:37:57.431
ELSE. BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE

03:37:57.497 --> 03:38:00.634
INVENTORY OF POLLUTANTS, WE TRY

03:38:00.700 --> 03:38:01.902
TO DETERMINE WHAT THOSE SOURCES

03:38:01.968 --> 03:38:04.638
ARE. WE TRY TO UNDERSTAND HOW

03:38:04.704 --> 03:38:06.106
THOSE SOURCES ARE EMITTED. WE

03:38:06.173 --> 03:38:07.441
TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE THE

03:38:07.507 --> 03:38:09.509
POLLUTION CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES

03:38:09.576 --> 03:38:10.610
THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THOSE

03:38:10.677 --> 03:38:12.646
SOURCES. AND THEN WE APPLY THAT

03:38:12.712 --> 03:38:15.115
WITH OUR UNDERSTANDING OF OUR

03:38:15.182 --> 03:38:17.284
JURISDICTION. WE DO A

03:38:17.350 --> 03:38:18.685
SOCIOECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF ALL

03:38:18.752 --> 03:38:20.086
THE THINGS THAT GO INTO IT,

03:38:20.153 --> 03:38:22.389
ALONG WITH CEQA ANALYSIS. AND

03:38:22.456 --> 03:38:24.791
WHAT WE DO IS A VERY LENGTHY

03:38:24.858 --> 03:38:27.494
PROCESS THAT INVOLVES TRYING TO

03:38:27.561 --> 03:38:28.662
GET AS MUCH INFORMATION SO THAT

03:38:28.728 --> 03:38:30.564
WE CAN PUT FORWARD A RULE THAT

03:38:30.630 --> 03:38:33.066
TAKES INTO ACCOUNT ALL OF THE

03:38:33.133 --> 03:38:34.501
CONSIDERATIONS, INCLUDING

03:38:34.568 --> 03:38:36.336
EMPLOYMENT IMPACTS ON ECONOMY,

03:38:36.403 --> 03:38:38.472
JOBS FOREGONE, ALL OF THOSE

03:38:38.538 --> 03:38:40.674
THINGS, THE COST EFFECTIVENESS,

03:38:40.740 --> 03:38:42.075
ARE ALL DETAILED IN THE REPORTS

03:38:42.142 --> 03:38:44.544
THAT WE PREPARE. THE RULEMAKING

03:38:44.611 --> 03:38:46.413
PROCESS IS A LENGTHY PROCESS

03:38:46.480 --> 03:38:47.848
BECAUSE IT INVOLVES SO MUCH

03:38:47.914 --> 03:38:50.350
STUDY AND DETERMINING WHAT THOSE

03:38:50.417 --> 03:38:52.819
IMPACTS ARE, AND IT IS NOT IT IS

03:38:52.886 --> 03:38:55.088
NOT A CLEAN PROCESS. THERE IS A

03:38:55.155 --> 03:38:56.323
LOT OF GIVE AND TAKE AND BACK

03:38:56.389 --> 03:38:58.358
AND FORTH WITH ALL OF THE

03:38:58.425 --> 03:39:00.827
AFFECTED STAKEHOLDERS. AND SO

03:39:00.894 --> 03:39:02.963
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE EMPLOYEE

03:39:03.029 --> 03:39:04.764
IMPACTS, THAT IS PART OF THE

03:39:04.831 --> 03:39:06.032
SOCIOECONOMIC ANALYSIS. AND IT'S

03:39:06.099 --> 03:39:09.035
ALSO PART OF THE JOBS THAT ARE

03:39:09.102 --> 03:39:11.104
FOREGONE ANALYSIS. SO WE PUT

03:39:11.171 --> 03:39:14.841
FORWARD THAT ENTIRE EFFORT INTO

03:39:14.908 --> 03:39:16.743
THE RULE MAKING PACKAGE AND TO

03:39:16.810 --> 03:39:18.445
STAFF REPORTS. AND ALL OF THAT

03:39:18.512 --> 03:39:21.014
GOES OUT. AS THE SENATOR NOTED,

03:39:21.081 --> 03:39:23.517
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON OUR OWN

03:39:23.583 --> 03:39:24.584
INDIRECT SOURCE RULE FOR A

03:39:24.651 --> 03:39:26.720
NUMBER OF YEARS, AND WE ARE

03:39:26.786 --> 03:39:29.222
PREPARED TO TAKE A MEASURE TO

03:39:29.289 --> 03:39:31.791
OUR BOARD IN OCTOBER. BUT WE ARE

03:39:31.858 --> 03:39:33.860
STILL BRINGING DRAFTS AND WE'RE

03:39:33.927 --> 03:39:35.695
STILL REACHING OUT TO WORKING

03:39:35.762 --> 03:39:36.796
GROUPS. WE'RE STILL TAKING

03:39:36.863 --> 03:39:38.932
INPUT. WE'RE STILL GOING TO OUR

03:39:38.999 --> 03:39:40.433
OWN COMMITTEES, SUCH AS OUR

03:39:40.500 --> 03:39:42.335
MOBILE SOURCE COMMITTEE, AND WE

03:39:42.402 --> 03:39:43.970
WILL BE TAKING INPUT AS WE

03:39:44.037 --> 03:39:45.772
CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD. AT THE

03:39:45.839 --> 03:39:47.307
SAME TIME, WE'RE ALSO IN

03:39:47.374 --> 03:39:48.275
DISCUSSIONS WITH OTHER

03:39:48.341 --> 03:39:49.376
STAKEHOLDERS, WHETHER IT BE

03:39:49.442 --> 03:39:50.610
COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS OR THE

03:39:50.677 --> 03:39:52.512
PORTS THEMSELVES OR THE CITIES

03:39:52.579 --> 03:39:54.080
OF LOS ANGELES AND LONG BEACH.

03:39:54.147 --> 03:39:55.115
AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO GO THROUGH

03:39:55.181 --> 03:39:57.050
THAT PROCESS. WE'LL CONTINUE TO

03:39:57.117 --> 03:39:59.619
TRY TO PUT FORWARD A PLAN THAT

03:39:59.686 --> 03:40:00.620
ADDRESSES ALL OF THE ELEMENTS

03:40:00.687 --> 03:40:01.621
AND THE CONCERNS. AND I'D LIKE

03:40:01.688 --> 03:40:03.590
TO POINT OUT THAT IN THE 50

03:40:03.657 --> 03:40:04.958
YEARS OF THE HISTORY OF THE

03:40:05.025 --> 03:40:07.060
SOUTH COAST AQMD WE HAVE DONE

03:40:07.127 --> 03:40:09.162
THAT, WE HAVE STILL ALLOWED FOR

03:40:09.229 --> 03:40:10.397
TREMENDOUS GROWTH IN THE SOUTH

03:40:10.463 --> 03:40:12.065
COAST REGION, AND WE HAVE

03:40:12.132 --> 03:40:14.601
CLEANED UP THE AIR TREMENDOUSLY.

03:40:14.668 --> 03:40:16.736
BUT WE ARE NOW BEHIND THE EIGHT

03:40:16.803 --> 03:40:19.005
BALL WHEN IT COMES TO OUR

03:40:19.072 --> 03:40:20.340
EFFORTS AND OUR ABILITY TO MOVE

03:40:20.407 --> 03:40:21.775
FORWARD. AND THAT'S BECAUSE SO

03:40:21.841 --> 03:40:23.410
MUCH OF THE EMISSION SOURCES,

03:40:23.476 --> 03:40:25.345
THE SOURCES OF POLLUTION THAT

03:40:25.412 --> 03:40:27.681
WE'RE NOW FACING, ARE COMING

03:40:27.747 --> 03:40:29.683
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND

03:40:29.749 --> 03:40:31.151
WHEN I SAY THAT, I MEAN, IT'S

03:40:31.217 --> 03:40:32.252
FROM FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

03:40:32.319 --> 03:40:34.120
CONTROLLED SOURCES. AND THOSE

03:40:34.187 --> 03:40:36.856
ARE THE THINGS THAT WE AS AN

03:40:36.923 --> 03:40:38.758
ENTITY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO

03:40:38.825 --> 03:40:39.759
OVERCOME. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

03:40:39.826 --> 03:40:41.528
CAN SAY, REGARDLESS OF THE

03:40:41.595 --> 03:40:44.130
AMOUNT OF EMISSIONS, THAT THOSE

03:40:44.197 --> 03:40:45.498
SOURCES THAT ARE UNDER OUR

03:40:45.565 --> 03:40:46.967
CONTROL, YOU MAY STILL HAVE TO

03:40:47.033 --> 03:40:48.802
MAKE UP THAT DIFFERENCE. AND

03:40:48.868 --> 03:40:51.037
WHAT THAT DOES IS IT CAUSES US

03:40:51.104 --> 03:40:53.473
TO LOOK AT WHAT THE SOURCES ARE.

03:40:53.540 --> 03:40:55.275
AND AS WE SAID EARLIER, WE TRY

03:40:55.342 --> 03:40:56.343
TO MAKE REASONABLE CONTROL

03:40:56.409 --> 03:40:57.577
ESTIMATES AND WHAT THOSE

03:40:57.644 --> 03:40:59.813
EMISSIONS COULD BE. BUT IF WE

03:40:59.879 --> 03:41:01.181
GET A FINDING, FOR INSTANCE,

03:41:01.247 --> 03:41:03.850
THAT WE NEED TO MAKE MORE

03:41:03.917 --> 03:41:05.418
IMPLEMENT ALL FEASIBLE MEASURES

03:41:05.485 --> 03:41:06.553
BECAUSE THEY WOULD SAY THAT YOU

03:41:06.620 --> 03:41:08.188
HAVEN'T DONE IT FOR THESE

03:41:08.254 --> 03:41:09.322
PARTICULAR SOURCES. THAT'S WHERE

03:41:09.389 --> 03:41:12.926
THE IMPOSITION OF POTENTIAL

03:41:12.993 --> 03:41:14.394
PENALTIES AND SANCTIONS WOULD

03:41:14.461 --> 03:41:16.463
TAKE INTO EFFECT. SO I HOPE I

03:41:16.529 --> 03:41:17.631
ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION. IT'S

03:41:17.697 --> 03:41:19.132
PRETTY BROAD IN TERMS OF THE

03:41:19.199 --> 03:41:20.634
AMOUNT OF TECHNOLOGY WORK THAT

03:41:20.700 --> 03:41:22.235
GOES INTO ANSWERING THOSE,

03:41:22.302 --> 03:41:24.037
WORKING WITH ALL OF THOSE

03:41:24.104 --> 03:41:25.171
STAKEHOLDERS, AND THEN WORKING

03:41:25.238 --> 03:41:26.239
WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND

03:41:26.306 --> 03:41:28.141
EVERYONE ELSE TO TRY TO DEVELOP

03:41:28.208 --> 03:41:29.509
A PLAN THAT CAN GET FORWARD THAT

03:41:29.576 --> 03:41:31.645
DOESN'T PROVIDE SANCTIONS TO OUR

03:41:31.711 --> 03:41:33.213
REGION, STILL PROVIDES CLEAN AIR

03:41:33.279 --> 03:41:34.748
AND IMPROVES PUBLIC HEALTH. I

03:41:34.814 --> 03:41:35.415
MIGHT HAVE MISSED SOMETHING

03:41:35.482 --> 03:41:38.084
HERE, BUT HOW LONG HAS THE PLAN

03:41:38.151 --> 03:41:39.252
BEEN? HAVE YOU GUYS BEEN WORKING

03:41:39.319 --> 03:41:40.353
ON THE PLAN? SO WE'VE WORKED ON

03:41:40.420 --> 03:41:42.455
A NUMBER OF ITERATIONS OF THE

03:41:42.522 --> 03:41:45.692
PLAN. AT FIRST, RIGHT BEFORE THE

03:41:45.759 --> 03:41:47.127
PANDEMIC, THE BOARD HAD DIRECTED

03:41:47.193 --> 03:41:49.629
US TO WORK WITH A MEMORANDUM OF

03:41:49.696 --> 03:41:50.730
UNDERSTANDING. WE ACTUALLY

03:41:50.797 --> 03:41:52.465
THOUGHT WE HAD MADE A LOT OF

03:41:52.532 --> 03:41:54.234
PROGRESS WITH BOTH PORTS. ONE OF

03:41:54.300 --> 03:41:55.502
THE KEY REQUIREMENTS, THOUGH,

03:41:55.568 --> 03:41:57.904
UNDER AN MOU, WAS THAT THERE BE

03:41:57.971 --> 03:41:59.806
ENFORCEABLE AGREEMENTS. AND SO

03:41:59.873 --> 03:42:01.574
WE THOUGHT WE HAD REACHED

03:42:01.641 --> 03:42:02.676
AGREEMENT ON ALL THE PROVISIONS.

03:42:02.742 --> 03:42:04.444
AND THEN WE WENT TO OUR BOARD

03:42:04.511 --> 03:42:05.979
MEETING, AND AT OUR BOARD

03:42:06.046 --> 03:42:06.980
MEETING, WE UNDERSTOOD THAT

03:42:07.047 --> 03:42:09.416
THERE WAS A RECENT CONCERN

03:42:09.482 --> 03:42:11.651
RAISED BY ONE OF THE PORTS THAT

03:42:11.718 --> 03:42:14.154
SAID, WE DON'T AGREE TO THIS,

03:42:14.220 --> 03:42:17.657
AND THAT PRETTY MUCH BLEW UP OUR

03:42:17.724 --> 03:42:19.893
ABILITY TO MOVE FORWARD ON THE

03:42:19.959 --> 03:42:22.028
MOU. AND SO THEN AFTER THAT, THE

03:42:22.095 --> 03:42:23.563
BOARD DIRECTED US AND WE WERE

03:42:23.630 --> 03:42:25.498
ENGAGED IN A NUMBER, AND WE

03:42:25.565 --> 03:42:27.033
STILL ARE ENGAGED IN A NUMBER OF

03:42:27.100 --> 03:42:27.767
RULEMAKING EFFORTS ACROSS

03:42:27.834 --> 03:42:30.637
DIFFERENT SOURCES TO LOOK AT THE

03:42:30.704 --> 03:42:33.907
PORTS, THE BOARD AT VARIOUS

03:42:33.973 --> 03:42:35.909
POINTS HAS SAID MOVE FORWARD IN

03:42:35.975 --> 03:42:37.744
A RULE, BUT ALSO STILL CONTINUE

03:42:37.811 --> 03:42:40.313
THE DISCUSSIONS ON AN MOU. AND

03:42:40.380 --> 03:42:42.115
SO WE'VE HAD THOSE DISCUSSIONS

03:42:42.182 --> 03:42:45.085
GOING BACK AND FORTH. I WOULD

03:42:45.151 --> 03:42:46.486
LIKE TO SAY AT THIS POINT THAT

03:42:46.553 --> 03:42:48.054
THE BOARD IS EXPECTING US TO

03:42:48.121 --> 03:42:50.190
BRING FORWARD RULE LANGUAGE. AS

03:42:50.256 --> 03:42:51.958
I SAID BEFORE, WE'RE STILL GOING

03:42:52.025 --> 03:42:54.527
IN OCTOBER. I'M NOT SURE THAT I

03:42:54.594 --> 03:42:56.529
COULD SAY TO YOU THAT IN OCTOBER

03:42:56.596 --> 03:42:58.798
IT WILL BE A RULE, IT WILL BE

03:42:58.865 --> 03:43:00.200
SOMETHING ELSE. BECAUSE, AS I

03:43:00.266 --> 03:43:02.035
SAID, WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A

03:43:02.102 --> 03:43:03.403
DIALOG WITH ALL THE

03:43:03.470 --> 03:43:05.171
STAKEHOLDERS, AND THAT'S WHAT

03:43:05.238 --> 03:43:09.876
WE'LL CONTINUE TO DO. MY TURN.

03:43:09.943 --> 03:43:12.412
ALL RIGHT, SENATOR, YOU ASKED

03:43:12.479 --> 03:43:13.913
TWO VERY BASIC QUESTIONS. THE

03:43:13.980 --> 03:43:17.450
FIRST ONE WAS, WHAT IS YOUR PLAN

03:43:17.517 --> 03:43:20.687
FOR ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS? FROM

03:43:20.754 --> 03:43:21.788
2000 TO 2007, I SERVED ON THE

03:43:21.855 --> 03:43:24.124
LONG BEACH CITY COUNCIL. DEALING

03:43:24.190 --> 03:43:26.126
WITH THE PORTS IS NOT A NEW

03:43:26.192 --> 03:43:27.894
ISSUE. IT'S ONE WE'VE DEALT WITH

03:43:27.961 --> 03:43:29.295
FOR DECADES. THE CITY OF LONG

03:43:29.362 --> 03:43:31.564
BEACH ADOPTED A GREEN FLAG

03:43:31.631 --> 03:43:33.299
PROGRAM. THEY VOLUNTARILY

03:43:33.366 --> 03:43:34.834
UNDERSTOOD THE SIGNIFICANCE OF

03:43:34.901 --> 03:43:36.336
OUR ENVIRONMENT. AND WHAT DID

03:43:36.402 --> 03:43:38.338
THE GREEN FLAG PROGRAM START OFF

03:43:38.404 --> 03:43:40.507
WITH? IT STARTED OFF WITH THAT.

03:43:40.573 --> 03:43:42.575
IF A VESSEL BEGAN TO APPROACH

03:43:42.642 --> 03:43:44.878
WITHIN 25 MILES, THAT THAT

03:43:44.944 --> 03:43:47.113
VESSEL THEN HAD TO REDUCE THEIR

03:43:47.180 --> 03:43:48.381
SPEED, WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE

03:43:48.448 --> 03:43:49.916
EMISSIONS THAT WAS GOING UP.

03:43:49.983 --> 03:43:51.351
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT? THEN WE

03:43:51.417 --> 03:43:53.720
LOOKED AT WHAT WAS THE FUEL THAT

03:43:53.787 --> 03:43:55.021
THEY WERE USING. COULD WE PUT A

03:43:55.088 --> 03:43:58.191
HOOD OVER THAT, OVER THAT HEAD

03:43:58.258 --> 03:43:59.392
SECTION WHERE THE EMISSIONS WERE

03:43:59.459 --> 03:44:01.394
GOING OUT TO REDUCE IT? SEVERAL

03:44:01.461 --> 03:44:02.796
STEPS HAD BEEN TAKEN, AND I

03:44:02.862 --> 03:44:04.397
FOUND IT KIND OF INTERESTING

03:44:04.464 --> 03:44:06.466
THAT THE WITNESS HERE HAD SAID,

03:44:06.533 --> 03:44:08.101
WELL, WE HAD MADE A LOT OF

03:44:08.168 --> 03:44:10.203
PROGRESS. HE SHOULD HAVE SAID

03:44:10.270 --> 03:44:11.437
THAT IN THE FIRST PART OF IT.

03:44:11.504 --> 03:44:13.106
BUT WHAT ELSE ARE WE DOING WITH

03:44:13.173 --> 03:44:14.674
OUR GOALS? AS I STATED, THE SAN

03:44:14.741 --> 03:44:17.610
PEDRO PORT COMPLEX AND THIS IS A

03:44:17.677 --> 03:44:19.846
REPORT THAT HIS DEPARTMENT, HIS

03:44:19.913 --> 03:44:21.147
AGENCY, ACTUALLY READ AND

03:44:21.214 --> 03:44:23.683
APPROVED AND THOUGHT THEY MADE A

03:44:23.750 --> 03:44:24.717
LOT OF PROGRESS. IT'S CALLED THE

03:44:24.784 --> 03:44:28.421
CLEAN ACTION PLAN OF THE PORT.

03:44:28.488 --> 03:44:30.523
2017 WAS A UPDATE OF THAT

03:44:30.590 --> 03:44:32.325
PARTICULAR PLAN. SO THE PORTS

03:44:32.392 --> 03:44:34.527
HAVE BEEN WORKING SINCE EARLY

03:44:34.594 --> 03:44:37.330
2000 STEADILY TO REDUCE

03:44:37.397 --> 03:44:40.633
EMISSIONS TO THE TUNE OF 91%.

03:44:40.700 --> 03:44:43.636
NITROGEN OXIDES DECREASED BY

03:44:43.703 --> 03:44:46.306
72%, SULFUR OXIDES DECREASED BY

03:44:46.372 --> 03:44:48.608
98%, GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

03:44:48.675 --> 03:44:50.710
DECREASED BY 20%. BUT LET ME

03:44:50.777 --> 03:44:52.245
FURTHER SAY YOU SAID, WHAT IS

03:44:52.312 --> 03:44:54.314
YOUR PLAN TO MEET THE

03:44:54.380 --> 03:44:56.249
ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS? I JUST

03:44:56.316 --> 03:44:57.750
PASSED OUT TO YOU A PIECE OF

03:44:57.817 --> 03:44:59.118
PAPER. AND WHAT DID YOU SEE WAS

03:44:59.185 --> 03:45:02.989
THE GREATEST EMITTER VESSELS?

03:45:03.056 --> 03:45:05.091
63%. OH, BY THE WAY, YOU HEARD

03:45:05.158 --> 03:45:07.660
THE WITNESS HERE. HE SAID IT'S A

03:45:07.727 --> 03:45:09.529
FEDERAL ISSUE. YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT

03:45:09.596 --> 03:45:11.030
IT IS. AND I HOPE I'M OKAY IF I

03:45:11.097 --> 03:45:13.333
USE A FEW WORDS HERE, BUT IT'S

03:45:13.399 --> 03:45:15.235
GETTING A LITTLE LATE. SO WHEN

03:45:15.301 --> 03:45:18.838
WE TALK ABOUT THE 63% EMISSIONS,

03:45:18.905 --> 03:45:20.240
WE DON'T CONTROL THE VESSELS

03:45:20.306 --> 03:45:22.175
THAT COME IN. WE DON'T CONTROL

03:45:22.242 --> 03:45:23.810
WHETHER WE ALL HAVE A

03:45:23.877 --> 03:45:25.211
STANDARDIZED HOOKUP. BUT WHAT WE

03:45:25.278 --> 03:45:27.513
DO CONTROL IS ONE THING WE

03:45:27.580 --> 03:45:29.716
CONTROL THAT WE NEED A 200

03:45:29.782 --> 03:45:32.518
MEGAWATT ELECTRIFICATION SYSTEM

03:45:32.585 --> 03:45:34.220
WHERE THE SHIPS CAN PLUG IN.

03:45:34.287 --> 03:45:37.190
THAT IS OUR PLAN OF HOW TO

03:45:37.257 --> 03:45:38.558
SIGNIFICANTLY FURTHER REDUCE.

03:45:38.625 --> 03:45:41.494
BUT WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? LA DWP

03:45:41.561 --> 03:45:43.730
HAS NOT SUBMITTED A PERMIT,

03:45:43.796 --> 03:45:46.165
HASN'T IDENTIFIED SITING, HAS

03:45:46.232 --> 03:45:48.635
NOT DONE ANYTHING TO ADDRESS

03:45:48.701 --> 03:45:51.137
THAT. AND BY ADDRESSING

03:45:51.204 --> 03:45:52.705
ELECTRIFICATION WE CAN HAVE AT

03:45:52.772 --> 03:45:55.241
BIRTH PLUGGING IN AND WE CAN

03:45:55.308 --> 03:45:56.209
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE IT. AND

03:45:56.276 --> 03:45:57.977
THEN YOU HEARD PEOPLE TALK ABOUT

03:45:58.044 --> 03:46:00.513
THIS IS THE DIRTIEST AREA. WELL,

03:46:00.580 --> 03:46:02.348
LET ME, YOU KNOW, GET YOUR

03:46:02.415 --> 03:46:04.417
THOUGHTS ON THIS. SO FIRST OF

03:46:04.484 --> 03:46:06.252
ALL, THIS AREA IS SURROUNDED BY

03:46:06.319 --> 03:46:08.087
THE LONG BEACH AIRPORT. AND THEN

03:46:08.154 --> 03:46:10.390
YOU HAVE LAX AIRPORT. OKAY. SO

03:46:10.456 --> 03:46:12.425
FIRST OF ALL YOU'VE GOT AVIATION

03:46:12.492 --> 03:46:13.826
THAT'S CONTRIBUTING. AND HERE'S

03:46:13.893 --> 03:46:16.162
THE PORT DOWN HERE. NOW WE'RE

03:46:16.229 --> 03:46:17.964
SURROUNDED BY FOUR MAJOR

03:46:18.031 --> 03:46:20.700
FREEWAYS THE 405, THE 110.

03:46:20.767 --> 03:46:22.902
YOU'VE GOT ALL THIS GOING HERE.

03:46:22.969 --> 03:46:25.104
AND WHERE WHEN THE PEOPLE SPOKE

03:46:25.171 --> 03:46:27.540
ABOUT THEIR OPPOSITION, WHERE IS

03:46:27.607 --> 03:46:29.575
THE GREATEST ASTHMA CLUSTER?

03:46:29.642 --> 03:46:31.311
IT'S NOT DOWN HERE AT THE PORT.

03:46:31.377 --> 03:46:33.313
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A REPORT THAT

03:46:33.379 --> 03:46:34.414
SAID LONGSHOREMEN HAVE THE MOST

03:46:34.480 --> 03:46:37.216
ASTHMA AND CANCER? NO. WHERE IS

03:46:37.283 --> 03:46:39.552
IT? IT'S THE 710 FREEWAY WHERE

03:46:39.619 --> 03:46:41.521
ALL THE TRUCKS THAT LEAVE THE

03:46:41.587 --> 03:46:43.489
PORT COME UP. AND THEN WHAT'S

03:46:43.556 --> 03:46:45.325
OUR OTHER CONTRIBUTOR? YOU HAVE

03:46:45.391 --> 03:46:47.293
THE ALAMEDA CORRIDOR. THAT'S

03:46:47.360 --> 03:46:49.829
RAIL. THAT'S FEDERAL ALSO. AND

03:46:49.896 --> 03:46:51.364
THEN FINALLY YOU HAVE THE BRIDGE

03:46:51.431 --> 03:46:52.799
HERE WHICH CONNECTS THERE. SO

03:46:52.865 --> 03:46:54.867
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE DIRTIEST

03:46:54.934 --> 03:46:57.737
AREA, THE PORT, YES, HAS A

03:46:57.804 --> 03:46:59.205
RESPONSIBILITY TO REDUCE

03:46:59.272 --> 03:47:00.807
EMISSIONS AND WILL CONTINUE TO

03:47:00.873 --> 03:47:03.209
DO SO. BUT OUR NUMBER ONE WAY TO

03:47:03.276 --> 03:47:05.345
DO IT IS THROUGH ELECTRIFICATION

03:47:05.411 --> 03:47:07.547
AND CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT THINGS

03:47:07.613 --> 03:47:09.949
LIKE ZERO EMISSIONS DRAYAGE

03:47:10.016 --> 03:47:11.951
TRUCKS. I'D WELCOME ANY OF YOU

03:47:12.018 --> 03:47:14.120
TO COME TO A TOUR OF THE PORT,

03:47:14.187 --> 03:47:15.955
AND YOU WILL SEE DRAYAGE TRUCKS

03:47:16.022 --> 03:47:17.490
THAT ARE NOW COMPLETELY

03:47:17.557 --> 03:47:19.225
ELECTRIFIED. SO WE HAVE TO

03:47:19.292 --> 03:47:20.893
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL OF THE

03:47:20.960 --> 03:47:23.096
TOOLS, THE ITEMS THAT WE HAVE TO

03:47:23.162 --> 03:47:25.264
MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN BE

03:47:25.331 --> 03:47:25.999
ELECTRIFIED. BUT THERE'S ONE

03:47:26.065 --> 03:47:27.600
THING ABOUT ELECTRIFIED, YOU GOT

03:47:27.667 --> 03:47:29.502
TO HAVE ELECTRICITY. AND RIGHT

03:47:29.569 --> 03:47:31.971
NOW WE DON'T EVEN HAVE ENOUGH

03:47:32.038 --> 03:47:33.573
ELECTRICITY TO AVOID THE

03:47:33.639 --> 03:47:35.208
BLACKOUTS, LET ALONE MOVING ALL

03:47:35.274 --> 03:47:37.777
OF THAT FROM THE PORT TO IT. AND

03:47:37.844 --> 03:47:41.047
THEN FINALLY, YOU ASKED A VERY

03:47:41.114 --> 03:47:42.415
APPROPRIATE QUESTION WHAT IS

03:47:42.482 --> 03:47:44.250
YOUR PLAN FOR THE WORKERS? HE

03:47:44.317 --> 03:47:46.152
DIDN'T ANSWER YOUR QUESTION.

03:47:46.219 --> 03:47:47.754
WHAT IS THE PLAN FOR THE

03:47:47.820 --> 03:47:49.756
WORKERS? IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

03:47:49.822 --> 03:47:51.858
BECAUSE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

03:47:51.924 --> 03:47:53.893
LARGEST PORT COMPLEX IN THE

03:47:53.960 --> 03:47:55.762
WESTERN HEMISPHERE, AND WE DON'T

03:47:55.828 --> 03:47:58.264
HAVE A PLAN. WHAT HAPPENS TO ALL

03:47:58.331 --> 03:48:00.366
THAT CARGO THAT'S COMING HERE?

03:48:00.433 --> 03:48:02.201
OUR PLAN IS A COUPLE THINGS.

03:48:02.268 --> 03:48:04.704
ONE, THE PORT HAS SUCCESSFULLY

03:48:04.771 --> 03:48:06.506
ALLOCATED MONEY TOWARDS HAVING

03:48:06.572 --> 03:48:08.408
AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM, ALSO

03:48:08.474 --> 03:48:11.344
A TRANSITIONING PROGRAM FOR THE

03:48:11.411 --> 03:48:12.245
ZERO EMISSIONS DRAYAGE TRUCKS

03:48:12.311 --> 03:48:14.814
THAT ARE AUTOMATED. THE WORKOUT

03:48:14.881 --> 03:48:18.418
THAT ILWU ESTABLISHED WAS THAT

03:48:18.484 --> 03:48:20.520
THOSE WORKERS NOW WOULD BE

03:48:20.586 --> 03:48:22.488
TRAINED TO BE MAINTENANCE AND TO

03:48:22.555 --> 03:48:24.157
HANDLE THE MAINTENANCE OF THOSE

03:48:24.223 --> 03:48:25.658
DRAYAGE TRUCKS. SO THERE'S QUITE

03:48:25.725 --> 03:48:27.393
A FEW THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING.

03:48:27.460 --> 03:48:30.329
AND FINALLY, WHAT IS OUR PLAN

03:48:30.396 --> 03:48:31.664
FOR ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS? OUR

03:48:31.731 --> 03:48:34.634
PLAN IS, IS THAT RIGHT NOW THIS

03:48:34.700 --> 03:48:37.203
PORT IS THE CLEANEST PORT IN THE

03:48:37.270 --> 03:48:41.074
WORLD. CLEANEST. ARE WE PERFECT?

03:48:41.140 --> 03:48:43.009
SHOULD WE GET BETTER? ABSOLUTELY

03:48:43.076 --> 03:48:45.445
WE WILL. BUT WE ARE THE CLEANEST

03:48:45.511 --> 03:48:47.647
IN THE WORLD. THANK YOU, THANK

03:48:47.713 --> 03:48:49.782
YOU. AND JUST TO I SEE

03:48:49.849 --> 03:48:50.416
OPPOSITION WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW

03:48:50.483 --> 03:48:52.318
UP. I'LL LET YOU DO SO VERY

03:48:52.385 --> 03:48:53.686
BRIEFLY. I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE

03:48:53.753 --> 03:48:57.356
THAT AS FAR AS OUTSIDE OF THE

03:48:57.423 --> 03:48:59.292
COAST, CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE A

03:48:59.358 --> 03:49:01.928
ROLE, NOT THE FEDS CARB. IT'S

03:49:01.994 --> 03:49:05.198
NOT SOUTH COAST AMD, BUT CARB IS

03:49:05.264 --> 03:49:07.500
IN CHARGE OF OUR COASTLINE 23

03:49:07.567 --> 03:49:08.835
MILES OUT. JUST TO MAKE SURE.

03:49:08.901 --> 03:49:10.269
CLARITY FOR THE COMMITTEE. AND

03:49:10.336 --> 03:49:12.205
I'LL ASK YOU TO BE BRIEF. I'M

03:49:12.271 --> 03:49:13.873
NOT SURE IF MY COLLEAGUE IS DONE

03:49:13.940 --> 03:49:15.741
WITH HER QUESTIONS, BUT I THINK

03:49:15.808 --> 03:49:17.076
THERE WAS SOMETHING YOU WANTED

03:49:17.143 --> 03:49:19.412
TO ADDRESS. SO A COUPLE OF QUICK

03:49:19.479 --> 03:49:19.979
POINTS. ONE, REGARDING THE

03:49:20.046 --> 03:49:20.780
EMISSION REDUCTIONS. YES. THERE

03:49:20.847 --> 03:49:22.215
HAS BEEN A MASSIVE REDUCTION

03:49:22.281 --> 03:49:24.350
SINCE 2005, BUT IF I WAS

03:49:24.417 --> 03:49:26.185
BRAGGING ABOUT WHAT I DID BACK

03:49:26.252 --> 03:49:27.053
IN 2005, I'D BE TALKING ABOUT

03:49:27.120 --> 03:49:29.021
WHAT I DID IN HIGH SCHOOL. THE

03:49:29.088 --> 03:49:30.957
FACT YOU TO SPEAK DIRECTLY TO

03:49:31.023 --> 03:49:32.758
WHAT YOU. I NOTED SOMETHING THAT

03:49:32.825 --> 03:49:34.427
SHE SAID. YEAH, I DO WANT TO SAY

03:49:34.494 --> 03:49:37.263
THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE EMISSION

03:49:37.330 --> 03:49:39.065
REDUCTIONS OVER THE PAST 20

03:49:39.132 --> 03:49:40.900
YEARS, YES, THERE WERE MASSIVE

03:49:40.967 --> 03:49:42.301
REDUCTIONS INITIALLY, BUT THOSE

03:49:42.368 --> 03:49:44.170
HAVE SINCE FLATLINED AND THAT

03:49:44.237 --> 03:49:46.005
WE'RE STILL IN A SITUATION WHERE

03:49:46.072 --> 03:49:48.508
THE PROGRESS THAT WE SAW TEN, 15

03:49:48.574 --> 03:49:50.543
YEARS AGO HAS ESSENTIALLY STAYED

03:49:50.610 --> 03:49:51.844
STILL. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME

03:49:51.911 --> 03:49:53.813
FLUCTUATIONS, YES, BUT THE

03:49:53.880 --> 03:49:55.548
PROGRESS HAS FLATLINED. THE

03:49:55.615 --> 03:49:57.116
OTHER THING REALLY QUICKLY, ON

03:49:57.183 --> 03:49:58.551
THE POINT ABOUT AUTOMATION, I

03:49:58.618 --> 03:49:59.952
WOULD SAY I CAN'T SPEAK FOR

03:50:00.019 --> 03:50:01.320
EVERY ENVIRONMENTAL

03:50:01.387 --> 03:50:03.156
ORGANIZATION, BUT I CAN SAY

03:50:03.222 --> 03:50:07.293
CERTAINLY FOR MOST THAT. YOU

03:50:07.360 --> 03:50:10.396
KNOW, IF WE HAVE TO HAVE A HUMAN

03:50:10.463 --> 03:50:12.265
OPERATED EQUIPMENT, THAT'S NOT

03:50:12.331 --> 03:50:14.800
OUR FIGHT. I PERSONALLY HAVE

03:50:14.867 --> 03:50:16.135
FAMILY WHO WORK AT THE PORTS. I

03:50:16.202 --> 03:50:17.970
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR

03:50:18.037 --> 03:50:19.805
JOBS ARE PROTECTED, TOO. AND I

03:50:19.872 --> 03:50:22.508
WOULD SAY, I THINK FOR US DULY

03:50:22.575 --> 03:50:23.709
NOTED, THAT SOUTH COAST IS THEIR

03:50:23.776 --> 03:50:25.545
NOT THEIR RESPONSIBILITY IS NOT

03:50:25.611 --> 03:50:27.380
AROUND HUMAN OPERATORS VERSUS

03:50:27.446 --> 03:50:28.414
AUTOMATION. I WANT TO GIVE IT

03:50:28.481 --> 03:50:30.550
BACK TO MY COLLEAGUE TO CONTINUE

03:50:30.616 --> 03:50:31.951
HER QUESTIONING IF SHE SO

03:50:32.018 --> 03:50:34.554
CHOOSES. YOU'RE DONE. OKAY,

03:50:34.620 --> 03:50:36.656
CHAIR, IF I MAY ANSWER A SIMILAR

03:50:36.722 --> 03:50:37.790
QUESTION ABOUT DISPLACED WORKERS

03:50:37.857 --> 03:50:39.325
FROM THE UNION PERSPECTIVE.

03:50:39.392 --> 03:50:40.960
OKAY. IF YOU COULD BE BRIEF, I

03:50:41.027 --> 03:50:42.261
WILL BE BRIEF. THE INDIRECT

03:50:42.328 --> 03:50:43.462
SOURCE RULE HAS BEEN PROPOSED

03:50:43.529 --> 03:50:45.798
DOES NOT HAVE ANYTHING RELATED

03:50:45.865 --> 03:50:47.567
TO HOW WE'RE GOING TO HANDLE

03:50:47.633 --> 03:50:49.735
WORKERS THAT ARE DISPLACED TO

03:50:49.802 --> 03:50:51.437
THAT POINT. AND FOR THE

03:50:51.504 --> 03:50:52.905
WAREHOUSE INDIRECT SOURCE RULE,

03:50:52.972 --> 03:50:54.674
THERE WAS AN ECONOMIC IMPACT

03:50:54.740 --> 03:50:56.742
ANALYSIS DONE, BUT IT WAS

03:50:56.809 --> 03:50:57.877
CONTRACTED OUT WITHOUT ANY

03:50:57.944 --> 03:50:59.946
FEEDBACK AND IT WAS A CARETAKER.

03:51:00.012 --> 03:51:01.147
THAT'S WHAT WE GOT. SO THANK

03:51:01.214 --> 03:51:04.050
YOU. THANK YOU. LOOKING TO ANY

03:51:04.116 --> 03:51:05.918
OTHER MEMBER OF COMMITTEE?

03:51:05.985 --> 03:51:07.053
JACKSON I'M SORRY I DID. HAVE

03:51:07.119 --> 03:51:08.254
YOU LISTED? WAS THERE ANOTHER

03:51:08.321 --> 03:51:10.256
MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE WHO

03:51:10.323 --> 03:51:11.891
WANTED TO SPEAK ON THIS? I CAN

03:51:11.958 --> 03:51:14.160
PUT YOU IN QUEUE. ALL RIGHT,

03:51:14.227 --> 03:51:14.827
THERE WE GO. JACKSON. THANK YOU

03:51:14.894 --> 03:51:16.596
VERY MUCH, MADAM CHAIR. I THINK

03:51:16.662 --> 03:51:20.366
MY QUESTION IS FOR OPPOSITION.

03:51:20.433 --> 03:51:23.102
OBVIOUSLY, AS YOU AS WE LOOK AT

03:51:23.169 --> 03:51:26.205
TODAY'S REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT

03:51:26.272 --> 03:51:27.940
IN TERMS OF ENVIRONMENTAL

03:51:28.007 --> 03:51:29.909
PROTECTIONS, ARE YOU ARGUING

03:51:29.976 --> 03:51:32.011
THAT WE ARE NO LONGER SEEING

03:51:32.078 --> 03:51:33.679
REDUCTIONS IN EMISSIONS AT THIS

03:51:33.746 --> 03:51:35.281
TIME, BUT WE'RE FLATLINING? OR

03:51:35.348 --> 03:51:37.350
ARE YOU JUST TALKING ABOUT

03:51:37.416 --> 03:51:38.884
SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THE

03:51:38.951 --> 03:51:45.124
PORT? IF I MAY, I WAS A FORMER

03:51:45.191 --> 03:51:47.593
US EPA REGIONAL ADMINISTRATOR,

03:51:47.660 --> 03:51:49.395
AND I'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH THE

03:51:49.462 --> 03:51:51.998
PORTS BACK ON THE ORIGINAL CLEAN

03:51:52.064 --> 03:51:54.767
AIR ACTION PLAN BACK IN THE MID

03:51:54.834 --> 03:51:57.236
2000 S, AND ONE OF THE EXAMPLES

03:51:57.303 --> 03:51:59.038
CITED WAS SOME OF THE THINGS

03:51:59.105 --> 03:52:00.873
THAT HAVE GONE ON. BUT IN THE

03:52:00.940 --> 03:52:02.775
TIME SINCE THEN, THERE HAS BEEN

03:52:02.842 --> 03:52:04.510
A TREMENDOUS INCREASE IN THE

03:52:04.577 --> 03:52:05.911
UNDERSTANDING OF OUR KNOWLEDGE

03:52:05.978 --> 03:52:08.881
ON THE COMBUSTION OF FUEL WITHIN

03:52:08.948 --> 03:52:10.850
SHIPS. AND DEPENDING ON THE TYPE

03:52:10.916 --> 03:52:12.785
OF VESSEL AND DEPENDING ON THE

03:52:12.852 --> 03:52:14.153
VESSEL SPEED, YOU CAN REDUCE THE

03:52:14.220 --> 03:52:15.721
VESSEL SPEED AND ACTUALLY

03:52:15.788 --> 03:52:17.089
INCREASE THE NOX EMISSION

03:52:17.156 --> 03:52:19.325
REDUCTIONS THAT WAS NOT KNOWN

03:52:19.392 --> 03:52:22.862
BACK IN THE EARLY 2000. THE

03:52:22.928 --> 03:52:24.764
PORTS HAVE UPGRADED THEIR CLEAN

03:52:24.830 --> 03:52:26.532
AIR ACTION PLANS, BUT THEY DID

03:52:26.599 --> 03:52:29.001
NOT UPDATE THE EMISSION

03:52:29.068 --> 03:52:31.570
REDUCTION PROJECTIONS BASED

03:52:31.637 --> 03:52:34.040
FORWARD. SO I, I MEAN I, I

03:52:34.106 --> 03:52:35.875
UNDERSTAND MY THE QUESTION I'M

03:52:35.941 --> 03:52:38.444
TRYING TO GET TO IS WHEN YOU

03:52:38.511 --> 03:52:42.315
LOOK AT WHAT AQMD HAS ALREADY

03:52:42.381 --> 03:52:44.517
DONE. YES. WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT

03:52:44.583 --> 03:52:46.085
THE PORTS HAVE ALREADY

03:52:46.152 --> 03:52:46.986
VOLUNTARILY DONE THROUGH THEIR

03:52:47.053 --> 03:52:49.355
OWN ACTION PLANS, AND WHEN YOU

03:52:49.422 --> 03:52:51.290
LOOK AT WHAT CARB HAS DONE

03:52:51.357 --> 03:52:54.493
OVERALL, ARE WE OR ARE WE NOT

03:52:54.560 --> 03:52:56.729
SEEING A STEADY REDUCTION OF

03:52:56.796 --> 03:52:58.864
EMISSIONS? OR ARE YOU SAYING

03:52:58.931 --> 03:53:01.267
THAT WE ARE NO LONGER SEEING A

03:53:01.334 --> 03:53:02.802
REDUCTION? WE ARE SEEING A

03:53:02.868 --> 03:53:03.869
REDUCTION OF EMISSIONS. WE

03:53:03.936 --> 03:53:05.304
ACTUALLY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL

03:53:05.371 --> 03:53:07.540
OF THE PLANS THAT HAVE BEEN

03:53:07.606 --> 03:53:08.674
DEVELOPED BEFOREHAND, BUT WHAT

03:53:08.741 --> 03:53:10.009
WE STILL NEED ARE ADDITIONAL

03:53:10.076 --> 03:53:11.344
EMISSION REDUCTIONS, AND THAT'S

03:53:11.410 --> 03:53:13.379
WHY WE UPDATE OUR PLANS AND TELL

03:53:13.446 --> 03:53:17.216
ME, WHY DO WE NEED ADDITIONAL

03:53:17.283 --> 03:53:18.718
REDUCTIONS WHEN OVER TIME WE

03:53:18.784 --> 03:53:21.253
KNOW THAT THESE EMISSIONS WILL

03:53:21.320 --> 03:53:22.922
CONTINUE TO GO DOWN? OR ARE YOU

03:53:22.988 --> 03:53:24.757
SAYING LIKE WHAT? WHAT IS WHAT

03:53:24.824 --> 03:53:26.559
IS YOUR ARGUMENT FOR? WE NEED

03:53:26.625 --> 03:53:28.794
ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS. SO YOU'RE

03:53:28.861 --> 03:53:30.863
RIGHT. SO WE DO SEE EMISSION. WE

03:53:30.930 --> 03:53:32.765
DO SEE ADDITIONAL EMISSION

03:53:32.832 --> 03:53:34.567
REDUCTIONS OVER TIME AS WE

03:53:34.633 --> 03:53:37.336
DEVELOP REGULATIONS. EMISSIONS

03:53:37.403 --> 03:53:41.407
ARE NOT REALIZED AT THE POINT OF

03:53:41.474 --> 03:53:42.842
ADOPTION. SO YOU DO NOT SEE THE

03:53:42.908 --> 03:53:45.578
ADVANTAGE OR THE END RESULT OF A

03:53:45.644 --> 03:53:48.147
REGULATION, OFTENTIMES UNTIL

03:53:48.214 --> 03:53:50.349
TEN, 20, EVEN 30 YEARS OUT,

03:53:50.416 --> 03:53:51.851
BECAUSE OFTENTIMES YOU'RE

03:53:51.917 --> 03:53:54.086
REPLACING EQUIPMENT. SO FOR

03:53:54.153 --> 03:53:55.788
INSTANCE, SOME OF THESE OCEAN

03:53:55.855 --> 03:53:57.189
GOING VESSEL ENGINES, THEY WILL

03:53:57.256 --> 03:53:59.759
LAST OVER 30, 40 YEARS. AND THEY

03:53:59.825 --> 03:54:02.328
WILL CONTINUE TO BE UTILIZED IN

03:54:02.395 --> 03:54:04.096
OPERATION. AND THEN AS A NEW

03:54:04.163 --> 03:54:05.798
RULE COMES INTO PLACE, THEN

03:54:05.865 --> 03:54:07.566
THOSE ENGINES EVENTUALLY GET

03:54:07.633 --> 03:54:10.169
PHASED IN. CORRECT. SO WHAT I'M

03:54:10.236 --> 03:54:11.637
SAYING IS THAT EVEN WITH OUR

03:54:11.704 --> 03:54:13.038
RULE PROJECTIONS AND WE SEE

03:54:13.105 --> 03:54:14.974
EMISSIONS GOING DOWN, WE KNOW

03:54:15.040 --> 03:54:16.909
THAT WE NEED STILL ADDITIONAL

03:54:16.976 --> 03:54:18.811
EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND THIS

03:54:18.878 --> 03:54:20.146
BILL WILL PROHIBIT YOU FROM

03:54:20.212 --> 03:54:23.149
DOING SO. THIS BILL CREATES A

03:54:23.215 --> 03:54:25.384
VERY DANGEROUS PRECEDENT IN THAT

03:54:25.451 --> 03:54:27.186
IT SAYS YOU CANNOT DO SOMETHING

03:54:27.253 --> 03:54:29.588
FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME. IT

03:54:29.655 --> 03:54:32.491
ALSO CREATES UNCERTAINTY AND

03:54:32.558 --> 03:54:35.060
AMBIGUITY WITH REGARDS TO THE

03:54:35.127 --> 03:54:37.596
CARGO CAPS AND THE WORK THAT IS

03:54:37.663 --> 03:54:39.365
DONE IN THAT SENSE. BECAUSE IF

03:54:39.432 --> 03:54:41.901
THERE IS DOUBT, THAT DOUBT IS

03:54:41.967 --> 03:54:43.269
OFTEN LITIGATED. IF THAT

03:54:43.335 --> 03:54:45.404
LITIGATION THEN OCCURS, THEN

03:54:45.471 --> 03:54:46.972
OFTENTIMES WE CANNOT IMPLEMENT

03:54:47.039 --> 03:54:49.041
RULES DURING THAT TIME. NO, I

03:54:49.108 --> 03:54:50.309
UNDERSTAND THAT. I MEAN, BUT

03:54:50.376 --> 03:54:51.444
WHEN YOU SAY PRECEDENT,

03:54:51.510 --> 03:54:53.345
PRECEDENT IS DIFFERENT FROM

03:54:53.412 --> 03:54:56.148
BECAUSE THAT IS PRETTY

03:54:56.215 --> 03:54:57.983
SUBJECTIVE. SO WHAT I'M SAYING

03:54:58.050 --> 03:55:00.486
IS, IS THAT DOES THIS BILL

03:55:00.553 --> 03:55:02.788
PROHIBIT YOU FROM CREATING

03:55:02.855 --> 03:55:04.223
ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS AS YOU

03:55:04.290 --> 03:55:07.092
SEE FIT ON THE BOARD TO CONTINUE

03:55:07.159 --> 03:55:09.228
TO DO THINGS IN YOUR PURVIEW?

03:55:09.295 --> 03:55:12.097
WELL, I WOULD SAY THERE'S A TIME

03:55:12.164 --> 03:55:13.866
FRAME ON THIS BILL WHICH GOES

03:55:13.933 --> 03:55:17.169
THROUGH 2031. IF EPA WERE TO SAY

03:55:17.236 --> 03:55:18.771
YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING BEFORE

03:55:18.838 --> 03:55:19.972
2031, THEN, AND IF THIS BILL

03:55:20.039 --> 03:55:22.241
WERE APPROVED, WE WOULD BE IN

03:55:22.308 --> 03:55:23.576
VIOLATION OF STATE LAW. SO THERE

03:55:23.642 --> 03:55:25.478
IS THAT POSSIBILITY. THERE IS

03:55:25.544 --> 03:55:28.214
THE POTENTIAL FOR THAT, WE

03:55:28.280 --> 03:55:30.015
THINK. BUT YOU DON'T KNOW FOR

03:55:30.082 --> 03:55:32.718
SURE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER I'M NOT

03:55:32.785 --> 03:55:34.053
SURE THAT ANYBODY COULD SAY THAT

03:55:34.119 --> 03:55:35.287
IN THESE TIMES THAT WE KNOW

03:55:35.354 --> 03:55:36.889
ANYTHING FOR SURE. BUT WHAT I

03:55:36.956 --> 03:55:38.224
THINK, WHAT I'M SAYING, WHAT I'M

03:55:38.290 --> 03:55:41.293
GETTING TO IS THIS IS THAT I

03:55:41.360 --> 03:55:42.361
MEAN, OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF LOW

03:55:42.428 --> 03:55:45.564
HANGING FRUIT IS NOW PICKED.

03:55:45.631 --> 03:55:46.866
GONE. EXACTLY. YEAH. WHICH MEANS

03:55:46.932 --> 03:55:50.135
NOW WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO DIG

03:55:50.202 --> 03:55:52.638
DEEPER INTO HOW WE CAN DO

03:55:52.705 --> 03:55:54.473
EMISSIONS, WHILE AT THE SAME

03:55:54.540 --> 03:55:56.342
TIME UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE

03:55:56.408 --> 03:55:59.512
ARE ECONOMY CONCERNS AS WELL.

03:55:59.578 --> 03:56:01.680
AND NOW THE QUESTION BECOMES,

03:56:01.747 --> 03:56:03.382
EVERY TIME WE DO A BILL LIKE

03:56:03.449 --> 03:56:06.819
THIS, WHICH IS I MEAN, I THINK

03:56:06.886 --> 03:56:08.821
IT'S GREAT TO ENGAGE IN THESE

03:56:08.888 --> 03:56:10.689
CONVERSATIONS AND THESE DEBATES

03:56:10.756 --> 03:56:12.458
THAT WE HAVE TO BEGIN TO NOT

03:56:12.525 --> 03:56:14.627
JUST LOOK AT A ONE ISSUE, BUT

03:56:14.693 --> 03:56:16.428
WE'RE NOW PLAYING A BALANCING

03:56:16.495 --> 03:56:18.898
ACT AS WE GO AND PICK HARDER AND

03:56:18.964 --> 03:56:22.535
HARDER AREAS TO GET INTO. SO I

03:56:22.601 --> 03:56:25.404
DON'T FIND IT HELPFUL TO TALK

03:56:25.471 --> 03:56:27.573
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, OPENING THE

03:56:27.640 --> 03:56:29.008
DOOR FOR SOMETHING POSITIVE IN

03:56:29.074 --> 03:56:32.244
THE SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE OR

03:56:32.311 --> 03:56:33.579
CREATING PRECEDENT FOR SOMETHING

03:56:33.646 --> 03:56:35.214
THAT WE MAY NEVER EVEN TOUCH IN

03:56:35.281 --> 03:56:37.049
THE FIRST PLACE. I'M TRYING TO

03:56:37.116 --> 03:56:39.051
FIGURE OUT, HOW DOES THIS BILL

03:56:39.118 --> 03:56:41.554
STOP US FROM CONTINUING IN A

03:56:41.620 --> 03:56:43.689
MORE CONCRETE WAY? NOT NOT

03:56:43.756 --> 03:56:47.326
BOOGEYMAN WAY IN A IN A CONCRETE

03:56:47.393 --> 03:56:48.761
WAY. NOW, I'M FOR ANYTHING THAT

03:56:48.827 --> 03:56:50.529
WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:56:50.596 --> 03:56:51.664
WE'RE ON A DOWNWARD TRAJECTORY.

03:56:51.730 --> 03:56:53.032
WE SHOULD NOT LOSE SIGHT OF

03:56:53.098 --> 03:56:56.368
THAT. HOWEVER, I'M TRYING TO GET

03:56:56.435 --> 03:57:03.142
TO A POINT WHERE. WE ARE TRYING

03:57:03.208 --> 03:57:06.912
TO IDENTIFY US CLOSING DOORS FOR

03:57:06.979 --> 03:57:08.314
DOWNWARD TRAJECTORY. NOW. I

03:57:08.380 --> 03:57:11.817
MEAN, I SIT ON CARB AND I KNOW

03:57:11.884 --> 03:57:13.619
OUR PROJECTIONS ARE NOT GOING AS

03:57:13.686 --> 03:57:15.688
FAST AS WE WANT THEM TO BE, BUT

03:57:15.754 --> 03:57:20.092
THEY ARE GOING DOWN. SO CAN YOU

03:57:20.159 --> 03:57:21.961
IDENTIFY ANYTHING THIS BILL THAT

03:57:22.027 --> 03:57:24.430
WILL REALLY PROHIBIT YOU NOW IN

03:57:24.496 --> 03:57:26.131
TERMS OF FEDERAL AND STATE LAW?

03:57:26.198 --> 03:57:28.767
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY THOSE ARE

03:57:28.834 --> 03:57:29.868
THINGS THAT IF THE FEDERAL

03:57:29.935 --> 03:57:32.104
GOVERNMENT DOES THIS I MEAN, AT

03:57:32.171 --> 03:57:33.372
THIS POINT, THE FEDERAL

03:57:33.439 --> 03:57:34.473
GOVERNMENT CAN DO ANYTHING JUST

03:57:34.540 --> 03:57:36.308
ABOUT NOW BEFORE THIS MEETING IS

03:57:36.375 --> 03:57:39.178
OVER. AND SO I'M I'M TRYING TO

03:57:39.244 --> 03:57:40.980
FIGURE OUT MORE CONCRETE THINGS

03:57:41.046 --> 03:57:43.449
THAT I CAN MAKE A DECISION ON,

03:57:43.515 --> 03:57:45.317
NOT HYPOTHETICALS. AND THAT'S

03:57:45.384 --> 03:57:48.921
WHERE I'M HAVING A HARD TIME ON

03:57:48.988 --> 03:57:51.457
THIS. I THINK MY LAST MY LAST

03:57:51.523 --> 03:57:54.293
QUESTION IS IN REGARDS TO

03:57:54.360 --> 03:57:58.564
ENSURING THAT AND ALSO THIS IS A

03:57:58.631 --> 03:58:01.500
QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR AS WELL.

03:58:01.567 --> 03:58:06.805
IS. DOES THIS BILL PROHIBIT OR

03:58:06.872 --> 03:58:09.074
WEAKEN COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION

03:58:09.141 --> 03:58:13.112
WHEN IT COMES TO PARTICIPATING

03:58:13.178 --> 03:58:15.314
IN PROVIDING INPUT LIKE VOICING

03:58:15.381 --> 03:58:17.750
CONCERNS IN TERMS OF

03:58:17.816 --> 03:58:20.352
REGULATIONS? WELL, FROM MY

03:58:20.419 --> 03:58:21.153
PERSPECTIVE, IT DOES BECAUSE

03:58:21.220 --> 03:58:23.088
IT'S SETTING THE RULES FROM THE

03:58:23.155 --> 03:58:24.490
TOP AND IT'S SAYING IT'S SETTING

03:58:24.556 --> 03:58:26.158
THE STRUCTURE OF WHAT ANY ACTION

03:58:26.225 --> 03:58:27.559
THAT SOUTH COAST DOES AND LIMITS

03:58:27.626 --> 03:58:29.995
ANY ACTION THAT SOUTH COAST DOES

03:58:30.062 --> 03:58:32.131
FROM SACRAMENTO. YOU KNOW, THERE

03:58:32.197 --> 03:58:33.632
HAVE BEEN A LOT OF

03:58:33.699 --> 03:58:34.733
CONVERSATIONS, A LOT OF PUBLIC

03:58:34.800 --> 03:58:37.503
MEETINGS, A LOT OF COMMUNITY

03:58:37.569 --> 03:58:40.506
PARTICIPATION IN TRYING TO

03:58:40.572 --> 03:58:41.540
ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES,

03:58:41.607 --> 03:58:42.941
THE PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, THE

03:58:43.008 --> 03:58:44.076
ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS, ALL

03:58:44.143 --> 03:58:47.212
THOSE FACTORS. IF THIS BILL

03:58:47.279 --> 03:58:48.681
MOVES FORWARD, IT IS SAYING

03:58:48.747 --> 03:58:52.217
SOUTH COAST CANNOT CONSIDER, YOU

03:58:52.284 --> 03:58:54.820
KNOW, DIFFERENT ACTIONS TO

03:58:54.887 --> 03:58:56.255
REDUCE AIR POLLUTION. BUT IT'S

03:58:56.321 --> 03:58:58.390
ALSO, I THINK, AS A STATEMENT

03:58:58.457 --> 03:59:00.959
SAYING THAT THE PROBLEM IS THAT

03:59:01.026 --> 03:59:03.796
WE NEED TO THAT THAT IT'S SAYING

03:59:03.862 --> 03:59:06.398
THAT THE ECONOMY AND PUBLIC

03:59:06.465 --> 03:59:07.866
HEALTH ARE TWO SEPARATE THINGS.

03:59:07.933 --> 03:59:10.002
THEY ARE TWO EXCLUSIVE CHOICES.

03:59:10.069 --> 03:59:11.637
AND THAT IS SAYING THAT THAT

03:59:11.704 --> 03:59:14.873
ACTING TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH

03:59:14.940 --> 03:59:17.142
INHERENTLY COMES AT THE COST OF

03:59:17.209 --> 03:59:19.645
ECONOMIC PRODUCTIVITY. I REFUSE

03:59:19.712 --> 03:59:21.180
TO ACCEPT THAT SORT OF FRAMING.

03:59:21.246 --> 03:59:22.848
I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT, LET'S

03:59:22.915 --> 03:59:24.683
REMEMBER, THE ONLY THING BEING

03:59:24.750 --> 03:59:25.784
CONSIDERED AT SOUTH COAST RIGHT

03:59:25.851 --> 03:59:27.419
NOW IS A REQUIREMENT TO DEVELOP

03:59:27.486 --> 03:59:29.288
AN INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN. WE'RE

03:59:29.354 --> 03:59:30.856
NOT TALKING ABOUT EMISSION

03:59:30.923 --> 03:59:31.423
REDUCTIONS RIGHT NOW. WE'RE

03:59:31.490 --> 03:59:34.393
TALKING ABOUT MAKING A PLAN FOR

03:59:34.460 --> 03:59:36.895
INFRASTRUCTURE. AND WHAT WE'RE

03:59:36.962 --> 03:59:39.098
SEEING NOW IS A BILL TO RESTRICT

03:59:39.164 --> 03:59:41.934
EVEN AQMD FROM CONSIDERING THAT

03:59:42.000 --> 03:59:45.137
ITEM. IF I COULD ADD TO THE HOLD

03:59:45.204 --> 03:59:46.972
ON TO THE AUTHOR, DOES DOES THAT

03:59:47.039 --> 03:59:48.540
RESTRICT YOU? DOES THIS BILL

03:59:48.607 --> 03:59:51.777
RESTRICT THEM FROM DOING THAT

03:59:51.844 --> 03:59:54.213
TYPE OF ACTION? ABSOLUTELY NOT.

03:59:54.279 --> 03:59:55.614
AND I WOULD ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE

03:59:55.681 --> 03:59:57.750
YOU TO READ THE ANALYSIS OF YOUR

03:59:57.816 --> 03:59:59.585
COMMITTEE CONSULTANT. IF YOU

03:59:59.651 --> 04:00:01.787
READ ON PAGE ONE, IT CLEARLY

04:00:01.854 --> 04:00:03.722
STATES REQUIRES IT DOESN'T SAY

04:00:03.789 --> 04:00:05.290
SOUTH COAST CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

04:00:05.357 --> 04:00:07.092
IT SAYS REQUIRE SOUTH COAST AIR

04:00:07.159 --> 04:00:09.595
QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT TO

04:00:09.661 --> 04:00:11.130
CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING. WHEN

04:00:11.196 --> 04:00:12.831
TAKING ACTION. IT'S SAYING

04:00:12.898 --> 04:00:14.433
THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE ACTION.

04:00:14.500 --> 04:00:15.667
IT'S SAYING THESE ARE THE THINGS

04:00:15.734 --> 04:00:17.603
THAT YOU COULD CONSIDER. AND

04:00:17.669 --> 04:00:19.571
THEN WHAT IT PROHIBITS THEM FROM

04:00:19.638 --> 04:00:22.040
IS IMPOSING A CAP. THAT'S TO

04:00:22.107 --> 04:00:23.542
SAY, IF THE PORTS ARE CURRENTLY

04:00:23.609 --> 04:00:25.844
MOVING THROUGH 1 MILLION TONS OF

04:00:25.911 --> 04:00:27.346
PRODUCT, THAT YOU CAN'T TELL

04:00:27.412 --> 04:00:28.413
THEM, HEY, WE'RE GOING TO SHUT

04:00:28.480 --> 04:00:30.582
YOU DOWN AND YOU CAN'T DO 1

04:00:30.649 --> 04:00:32.718
MILLION, IT GIVES THEM A

04:00:32.785 --> 04:00:34.219
STAKEHOLDERS, AN OPPORTUNITY TO

04:00:34.286 --> 04:00:35.954
COME TOGETHER AND SAY, YOU KNOW

04:00:36.021 --> 04:00:37.790
WHAT? MAYBE INSTEAD OF US

04:00:37.856 --> 04:00:40.325
OPERATING FROM 8 TO 5, MAYBE WE

04:00:40.392 --> 04:00:42.327
OPERATE FROM 6 A.M. TO 12 AND

04:00:42.394 --> 04:00:46.765
FROM 5 P.M. TO 12 MIDNIGHT. IT

04:00:46.832 --> 04:00:49.234
DOESN'T SAY IN HERE ANYTHING. IT

04:00:49.301 --> 04:00:50.636
PROHIBITS THEM FROM USING PUBLIC

04:00:50.702 --> 04:00:54.306
FUNDS IN THE DIFFERENT STANDARDS

04:00:54.373 --> 04:00:56.508
TO ADVANCE AUTOMATION, AND IT

04:00:56.575 --> 04:00:59.344
PROHIBITS AUTHORIZING ACTIONS OF

04:00:59.411 --> 04:01:01.180
PROCUREMENT OF HUMAN OPERATED

04:01:01.246 --> 04:01:02.548
ZERO EMISSIONS EQUIPMENT. BUT

04:01:02.614 --> 04:01:04.082
READ YOUR OWN ANALYSIS RIGHT

04:01:04.149 --> 04:01:05.584
HERE. IT DOESN'T TELL THEM THAT

04:01:05.651 --> 04:01:07.286
THEY CANNOT TAKE ACTION AND THEY

04:01:07.352 --> 04:01:11.256
CAN'T ADOPT RULES. FINALLY, MR.

04:01:11.323 --> 04:01:12.658
JACKSON, ASSEMBLY MEMBER, YOU

04:01:12.724 --> 04:01:14.493
ASKED A REAL SIMPLE QUESTION.

04:01:14.560 --> 04:01:15.861
HAVE YOU SEEN IMPROVEMENTS AT

04:01:15.928 --> 04:01:18.297
THE PORT? AND HE HE ADMITTED,

04:01:18.363 --> 04:01:20.165
YES, WE'VE SEEN QUITE A LOT. YOU

04:01:20.232 --> 04:01:21.667
HAVE ONE OF THE REPRESENTATIVES

04:01:21.733 --> 04:01:23.435
HERE, THE PORT OF LONG BEACH,

04:01:23.502 --> 04:01:25.137
AND YOU HAVE AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER

04:01:25.204 --> 04:01:27.206
HERE WHO REPRESENTS THAT PORT.

04:01:27.272 --> 04:01:28.841
AND I'M SURE HE WOULD TELL YOU

04:01:28.907 --> 04:01:30.976
AS WELL. THERE HAS BEEN

04:01:31.043 --> 04:01:32.544
SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS AND

04:01:32.611 --> 04:01:33.979
THEY'RE CONTINUING TO DO SO. AND

04:01:34.046 --> 04:01:36.048
HE'S PREPARED TO ANSWER THE

04:01:36.114 --> 04:01:37.583
QUESTION, YES OR NO? HAVE THEY

04:01:37.649 --> 04:01:39.918
DONE IMPROVEMENTS AND ARE THEY

04:01:39.985 --> 04:01:42.554
WORKING TO CONTINUE TO DO SO?

04:01:42.621 --> 04:01:45.090
YEAH. SENATOR JACKSON, IF I MAY,

04:01:45.157 --> 04:01:48.594
I THINK THE MEMBER OF THE

04:01:48.660 --> 04:01:50.429
COMMITTEE HAS ASKED FOR AN

04:01:50.495 --> 04:01:52.731
ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL WITNESS,

04:01:52.798 --> 04:01:54.032
AND WE DO ALLOW ADDITIONAL

04:01:54.099 --> 04:01:55.901
TECHNICAL WITNESSES. SO I WOULD

04:01:55.968 --> 04:01:58.370
ASK THAT THE WITNESS BE NOT

04:01:58.437 --> 04:02:00.572
PROVIDE A COMMENTARY, BUT ONLY

04:02:00.639 --> 04:02:02.441
ANSWER THE QUESTION DIRECTLY AND

04:02:02.507 --> 04:02:04.576
FACTUALLY. YES, MA'AM. DAN SHAW,

04:02:04.643 --> 04:02:07.045
ON BEHALF OF THE PORT OF LONG

04:02:07.112 --> 04:02:07.980
BEACH AND AS TECHNICAL

04:02:08.046 --> 04:02:09.581
ASSISTANCE IN RESPONSE TO THE

04:02:09.648 --> 04:02:12.417
MEMBER'S QUESTION, ESPECIALLY IN

04:02:12.484 --> 04:02:14.686
REGARDS TO CONTINUED EMISSION

04:02:14.753 --> 04:02:16.388
REDUCTIONS SINCE THE CLEAN AIR

04:02:16.455 --> 04:02:18.123
ACTION PLAN THAT WAS REFERENCED.

04:02:18.190 --> 04:02:20.792
SO I'LL NOTE THAT FROM 2017 TO

04:02:20.859 --> 04:02:22.961
2023, NOX EMISSIONS HAVE

04:02:23.028 --> 04:02:25.097
DECREASED 34% AND PARTICULATE

04:02:25.163 --> 04:02:27.532
MATTER AN ADDITIONAL 20%. AND

04:02:27.599 --> 04:02:28.967
WHAT DO YOU ANTICIPATE YOU DO

04:02:29.034 --> 04:02:31.870
YOU ANTICIPATE FUTURE EMISSIONS

04:02:31.937 --> 04:02:33.305
BASED UPON THE REGULATIONS

04:02:33.372 --> 04:02:34.473
YOU'VE ALREADY SET FORTH, OR DO

04:02:34.539 --> 04:02:36.441
YOU BELIEVE IT'LL PLATEAU? WE

04:02:36.508 --> 04:02:38.543
ARE WE ARE GETTING TO ZERO

04:02:38.610 --> 04:02:40.612
EMISSIONS. THAT IS OUR GOAL AS A

04:02:40.679 --> 04:02:43.048
AS A PORT. BUT ARE YOUR

04:02:43.115 --> 04:02:44.850
PROJECTIONS SAYING THAT YOU BUY

04:02:44.917 --> 04:02:46.985
THAT YOU ARE BY WHAT YOU ALREADY

04:02:47.052 --> 04:02:49.488
HAVE IN PLACE IN TERMS OF YOUR

04:02:49.554 --> 04:02:52.424
PLAN? DO YOU SEE DO YOU

04:02:52.491 --> 04:02:53.825
ANTICIPATE CONTINUED REDUCTIONS

04:02:53.892 --> 04:02:55.761
BASED UPON WHAT YOU ALREADY HAVE

04:02:55.827 --> 04:02:57.062
IN PLACE, NOT WHERE YOU'RE

04:02:57.129 --> 04:03:00.299
TRYING TO GO? I CANNOT ANSWER

04:03:00.365 --> 04:03:03.201
THAT QUESTION. OKAY, YEAH, BUT

04:03:03.268 --> 04:03:05.037
WE ARE GETTING WE ARE GETTING TO

04:03:05.103 --> 04:03:06.438
ZERO. WE'RE MAKING CONTINUED

04:03:06.505 --> 04:03:09.641
INVESTMENTS TO GET TO ZERO. AND

04:03:09.708 --> 04:03:11.910
OF COURSE, THERE'S A LOT OF WORK

04:03:11.977 --> 04:03:14.046
TO BE DONE. BUT WE ARE MAKING

04:03:14.112 --> 04:03:15.047
THOSE INVESTMENTS. YEAH. THANK

04:03:15.113 --> 04:03:17.716

04:03:17.783 --> 04:03:19.017
JACKSON, ARE YOU COMPLETE OKAY.

04:03:19.084 --> 04:03:20.452
LOOKING FOR ANY MEMBER OF THE

04:03:20.519 --> 04:03:22.688
PUBLIC? I'M SORRY, NOT PUBLIC

04:03:22.754 --> 04:03:25.257
COMMITTEE. WHO WOULD LIKE TO

SECOND. WE HAVE A MOTION MADE BY

04:03:38.036 --> 04:03:39.905
AARONS. IS THERE A SECOND?

04:03:39.972 --> 04:03:45.677
THROUGH YOU TO THE WITNESS IN

04:03:45.744 --> 04:03:47.612
OPPOSITION. YOU HAD A QUESTION

04:03:47.679 --> 04:03:49.982
OR. MADAM CHAIR, I THOUGHT THAT

04:03:50.048 --> 04:03:51.850
IN RESPONSE TO COMMITTEE MEMBER

04:03:51.917 --> 04:03:52.985
JACKSON'S, I WOULD HAVE THE

04:03:53.051 --> 04:03:54.619
OPPORTUNITY TO AT LEAST ANSWER

04:03:54.686 --> 04:03:56.888
HIS QUESTION FROM MY

04:03:56.955 --> 04:03:58.657
PERSPECTIVE. BUT CHRIS SPOKE

04:03:58.724 --> 04:04:01.159
FIRST BEFORE I DID. I JUST ASKED

04:04:01.226 --> 04:04:02.594
FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY. WHAT I

04:04:02.661 --> 04:04:04.429
WILL LOOK TO IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER

04:04:04.496 --> 04:04:06.264
JACKSON. DO YOU FEEL CONFIDENT

04:04:06.331 --> 04:04:08.100
IN YOUR QUESTION IS ANSWERED AND

04:04:08.166 --> 04:04:10.168
I'LL LOOK TO YOU TO SEE IF I

04:04:10.235 --> 04:04:11.737
CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO SHUT

04:04:11.803 --> 04:04:12.871
DOWN ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

04:04:12.938 --> 04:04:14.840
THAT WANT TO BE MADE. I MEAN, IF

04:04:14.906 --> 04:04:17.275
YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO OFFER

04:04:17.342 --> 04:04:20.645
HERE. YES. AS A BOARD MEMBER OF

04:04:20.712 --> 04:04:22.080
CARB, YOU'LL APPRECIATE THE

04:04:22.147 --> 04:04:23.448
RECENT ACTIONS ON THE REVOCATION

04:04:23.515 --> 04:04:25.317
OF THE WAIVERS AND THE

04:04:25.384 --> 04:04:27.052
WITHDRAWAL OF THE LOCOMOTIVE

04:04:27.119 --> 04:04:29.087
PROPOSED RULE. WHAT THOSE DO IS

04:04:29.154 --> 04:04:31.490
THEY PUT MORE PRESSURE ON THE

04:04:31.556 --> 04:04:32.491
LOCAL DISTRICTS, BUT IT'S THE

04:04:32.557 --> 04:04:34.226
LOCAL DISTRICTS WHERE THE LOCAL

04:04:34.292 --> 04:04:35.494
ACTIONS ARE BEING MADE UNDER

04:04:35.560 --> 04:04:39.064
LOCAL AUTHORITY. THIS BILL TAKES

04:04:39.131 --> 04:04:42.234
AWAY THE OPTION IF LET ME

04:04:42.300 --> 04:04:44.803
RESTATE THAT THIS BILL MOVES

04:04:44.870 --> 04:04:46.071
WHAT SHOULD BE A LOCAL DECISION

04:04:46.138 --> 04:04:48.673
AND A LOCAL ACTION. BY IMPOSING

04:04:48.740 --> 04:04:52.310
SB 34 AND TO THE POINT ABOUT THE

04:04:52.377 --> 04:04:55.647
PORTS AND THEIR EFFORTS TO

04:04:55.714 --> 04:04:58.016
CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THE AIR?

04:04:58.083 --> 04:04:59.384
ABSOLUTELY. THE PORTS ARE DOING

04:04:59.451 --> 04:05:00.986
THE RIGHT THING, BUT WE STILL

04:05:01.053 --> 04:05:02.587
NEED MORE EMISSION REDUCTIONS,

04:05:02.654 --> 04:05:04.890
AND THE PORTS HAVE THE ABILITY

04:05:04.956 --> 04:05:06.992
TO WORK WITH OTHER AREAS

04:05:07.059 --> 04:05:08.827
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. AND I KNOW

04:05:08.894 --> 04:05:10.062
THIS BECAUSE I'VE WORKED WITH

04:05:10.128 --> 04:05:11.930
THE PORT OF LONG BEACH IN

04:05:11.997 --> 04:05:13.532
DEVELOPING A GREEN CORRIDOR,

04:05:13.598 --> 04:05:15.634
SISTER CITY RELATIONSHIP WITH

04:05:15.700 --> 04:05:17.803
SHENZHEN IN CHINA. AND IN THOSE

04:05:17.869 --> 04:05:19.337
TYPE OF ARRANGEMENTS, THEY'RE

04:05:19.404 --> 04:05:20.739
LOOKING AT WHAT ARE THE FUEL

04:05:20.806 --> 04:05:22.841
USES, WHETHER IT BE METHANOL,

04:05:22.908 --> 04:05:26.344
WHETHER IT BE AMMONIA TO GET TO

04:05:26.411 --> 04:05:27.212
ZERO EMISSION AND TO THE POINT

04:05:27.279 --> 04:05:29.481
THAT WAS MADE EARLIER ABOUT IT'S

04:05:29.548 --> 04:05:30.849
ALL ABOUT THE ELECTRICAL

04:05:30.916 --> 04:05:32.617
INFRASTRUCTURE. YOU'RE DOING A

04:05:32.684 --> 04:05:33.952
FOLLOW UP OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER

04:05:34.019 --> 04:05:36.288
JACKSON'S COMMENTS. SO I WOULD

04:05:36.354 --> 04:05:37.889
ASK YOU TO LIMIT YOUR TESTIMONY

04:05:37.956 --> 04:05:39.458
TO THAT. IF ASSEMBLY MEMBER

04:05:39.524 --> 04:05:41.960
JACKSON IS SATISFIED, AND I

04:05:42.027 --> 04:05:43.895
APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR YOUR

04:05:43.962 --> 04:05:45.964
ARGUMENT IN TERMS OF THERE WERE

04:05:46.031 --> 04:05:47.799
SOME ON THE BOOKS, BUT NOW SOME

04:05:47.866 --> 04:05:50.168
OF THEM HAVE BEEN RESCINDED DUE

04:05:50.235 --> 04:05:52.337
TO FEDERAL POSTURE. YES. AND

04:05:52.404 --> 04:05:54.106
THAT ALSO THAT ELECTRICAL

04:05:54.172 --> 04:05:55.173
INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT THE ONLY

04:05:55.240 --> 04:05:56.541
IT'S HYDROGEN AS WELL. IT'S.

04:05:56.608 --> 04:05:58.043
YEAH, IT'S MULTIPLE WAYS.

04:05:58.110 --> 04:06:00.679
MULTIPLE WAYS. ALL RIGHT. SURE I

04:06:00.745 --> 04:06:02.914

BACK AND FORTH AND I ALWAYS

04:06:08.120 --> 04:06:09.054
APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION, BUT I

04:06:09.121 --> 04:06:11.289
JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE STAY

04:06:11.356 --> 04:06:13.024
ON TRACK AND RECOGNIZE WE STILL

04:06:13.091 --> 04:06:14.292
HAVE SIX OTHER BILLS TO HEAR

04:06:14.359 --> 04:06:15.260
THIS EVENING. SO THANK YOU TO

04:06:15.327 --> 04:06:16.995
THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS

04:06:17.062 --> 04:06:20.098
FORWARD. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR

04:06:20.165 --> 04:06:22.400
COMMITMENT TO WORK WITH NOT ONLY

04:06:22.467 --> 04:06:24.870
MY STAFF, BUT ALL STAKEHOLDERS

04:06:24.936 --> 04:06:26.271
INVOLVED. I WILL NOTE FOR

04:06:26.338 --> 04:06:27.339
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT

04:06:27.405 --> 04:06:29.541
THIS BILL WAS DOUBLE REFERRED TO

04:06:29.608 --> 04:06:32.410
NATURAL RESOURCES, WHERE IT WAS

04:06:32.477 --> 04:06:34.513
AMENDED PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY AND

04:06:34.579 --> 04:06:35.647
DID GET OUT OF THAT COMMITTEE

04:06:35.714 --> 04:06:37.482
WITH 10 TO 1 PART OF THE

04:06:37.549 --> 04:06:40.118
AGREEMENT TO GET IT OUT OF

04:06:40.185 --> 04:06:42.754
COMMITTEE WAS TO ADDRESS THIS

04:06:42.821 --> 04:06:44.656
ISSUE OF THE CAPS, AND WHETHER

04:06:44.723 --> 04:06:46.258
THAT WAS DIRECT OR INDIRECT. AND

04:06:46.324 --> 04:06:49.294
SO WE WERE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT

04:06:49.361 --> 04:06:49.895
WITH THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS

04:06:49.961 --> 04:06:50.495
COMMITTEE. I DO BELIEVE THAT

04:06:50.562 --> 04:06:52.631
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE A

04:06:52.697 --> 04:06:53.598
COLLABORATIVE AND TRANSPARENT

04:06:53.665 --> 04:06:55.133
PROCESS WHEN DEVELOPING

04:06:55.200 --> 04:06:56.134
REGULATIONS. I DO BELIEVE THAT

04:06:56.201 --> 04:06:59.004
IS OUR AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT

04:06:59.070 --> 04:07:00.405
DISTRICT, WHICH I HAD AN

04:07:00.472 --> 04:07:02.073
OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE ON ONE FOR

04:07:02.140 --> 04:07:03.608
A NUMBER OF YEARS, PLAY A KEY

04:07:03.675 --> 04:07:05.443
PART IN THAT. AT THE SAME TIME,

04:07:05.510 --> 04:07:07.112
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIA TO

04:07:07.179 --> 04:07:08.346
STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN

04:07:08.413 --> 04:07:09.147
MAINTAINING AND IMPROVING THE

04:07:09.214 --> 04:07:11.149
AIR QUALITY IN OUR MOST

04:07:11.216 --> 04:07:12.050
VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND

04:07:12.117 --> 04:07:14.152
ENSURING THE ECONOMIC VIBRANCY

04:07:14.219 --> 04:07:16.021
OF OUR PORTS. AND I DO BELIEVE

04:07:16.087 --> 04:07:18.690
THAT WE HAVE GOTTEN TO STRIKING,

04:07:18.757 --> 04:07:20.425
STRIKING THAT BALANCE, GIVEN THE

04:07:20.492 --> 04:07:22.327
FACT THAT THERE IS A PAUSE ON

04:07:22.394 --> 04:07:24.596
THE ON ON THE ABILITY TO ACT

04:07:24.663 --> 04:07:26.364
WITHOUT CONDITION, AND IT JUST

04:07:26.431 --> 04:07:27.999
PROVIDES A LEVEL OF CONDITIONS

04:07:28.066 --> 04:07:30.435
AND CONSIDERATION IN REGARD TO

04:07:30.502 --> 04:07:31.336
THAT, DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE

04:07:31.403 --> 04:07:32.938
DO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE

04:07:33.004 --> 04:07:35.373
FEDS, IT CREATES A VOLATILE

04:07:35.440 --> 04:07:37.242
ENVIRONMENT AND INCLUDING, AS

04:07:37.309 --> 04:07:39.778

TIGHTENING. AND SO WE DO HAVE TO

04:07:47.953 --> 04:07:49.354
TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION.

04:07:49.421 --> 04:07:50.088
AND I HOPE THAT THE PORTS, AS

04:07:52.023 --> 04:07:55.193

04:10:49.768 --> 04:10:51.236
MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS, I'D

04:10:52.771 --> 04:10:54.472
THE COMMITTEE'S AMENDMENTS TODAY

04:10:54.539 --> 04:10:55.840
AND WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE

04:10:55.907 --> 04:10:57.709
CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF

04:10:57.776 --> 04:10:59.511
FOR WORKING DILIGENTLY WITH THE

04:10:59.577 --> 04:11:00.979
SPONSORS IN MY OFFICE ON THIS

04:11:01.045 --> 04:11:03.848
BILL. SB 703 REPRESENTS A

04:11:03.915 --> 04:11:05.550
CRITICAL STEP IN ENSURING THAT

04:11:05.617 --> 04:11:07.752
OUR STATE'S TRUCKING INDUSTRY

04:11:07.819 --> 04:11:09.621
OPERATES IN A FAIR, LEGAL AND

04:11:09.687 --> 04:11:11.790
TRANSPARENT MANNER.

04:11:11.856 --> 04:11:13.124
MISCLASSIFICATION OF WORKERS AS

04:11:13.191 --> 04:11:14.659
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IS A

04:11:14.726 --> 04:11:16.461
LONG STANDING ISSUE IN THE

04:11:16.528 --> 04:11:18.396
TRUCKING INDUSTRY, PARTICULARLY

04:11:18.463 --> 04:11:20.732
AT OUR PORTS. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN

04:11:20.799 --> 04:11:23.168
THAT WHILE 82% OF PORT TRUCK

04:11:23.234 --> 04:11:25.437
DRIVERS ARE LABELED AS

04:11:25.503 --> 04:11:26.838
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS, MORE

04:11:26.905 --> 04:11:30.742
THAN 80% OF THOSE ARE ACTUALLY

04:11:30.809 --> 04:11:33.211
MISCLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES. THE

04:11:33.278 --> 04:11:34.312
LEGISLATURE HAS ESTABLISHED

04:11:34.379 --> 04:11:36.214
IMPORTANT ACCOUNTABILITY

04:11:36.281 --> 04:11:37.315
MEASURES OVER THE YEARS.

04:11:37.382 --> 04:11:39.484
HOWEVER, ENFORCEMENT REMAINS A

04:11:39.551 --> 04:11:40.852
CHALLENGE DUE TO THE CRITICAL

04:11:40.919 --> 04:11:43.421
LACK OF DATA. I'M GOING TO SKIP

04:11:43.488 --> 04:11:45.190
DOWN AND AVOID SOME OF THESE

04:11:45.256 --> 04:11:47.425
WORDS, BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE I

04:11:47.492 --> 04:11:49.227
HIT THE KEY POINTS FOR THE CHAIR

04:11:49.294 --> 04:11:52.163
AND THE STAFF. WE RECOGNIZE THAT

04:11:52.230 --> 04:11:53.832
THE PORTS ARE NAVIGATING A

04:11:53.898 --> 04:11:55.900
COMPLEX LANDSCAPE RIGHT NOW

04:11:55.967 --> 04:11:58.436
TARIFFS, LABOR UNREST, ENERGY

04:11:58.503 --> 04:11:59.871
TRANSITION ARE ALL CONTRIBUTING

04:11:59.938 --> 04:12:02.073
TO A HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY.

04:12:02.140 --> 04:12:03.541
SINCE THE BILL WAS INTRODUCED

04:12:03.608 --> 04:12:05.743
BACK IN FEBRUARY, I HAVE

04:12:05.810 --> 04:12:07.111
ACTIVELY ENGAGED WITH

04:12:07.178 --> 04:12:08.346
STAKEHOLDERS, AND I'M PLEASED TO

04:12:08.413 --> 04:12:11.115
NOTE THAT THOSE EFFORTS HAVE LED

04:12:11.182 --> 04:12:12.150
TO FORMER OPPONENTS MOVING TO A

04:12:12.217 --> 04:12:14.686
NEUTRAL POSITION. I WANT TO BE

04:12:14.752 --> 04:12:16.554
ABSOLUTELY CLEAR I'M FULLY

04:12:16.621 --> 04:12:18.323
COMMITTED TO WORKING IN GOOD

04:12:18.389 --> 04:12:20.158

I'M ACCEPTING TODAY ARE ENTIRELY

04:12:31.002 --> 04:12:33.037
IN RESPONSE TO THEIR FEEDBACK,

04:12:33.104 --> 04:12:35.273
AND I WILL CONTINUE ENGAGING

04:12:35.340 --> 04:12:37.041
DIRECTLY WITH THEM TO FIND

04:12:37.108 --> 04:12:38.776
THOUGHTFUL, PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS.

04:12:38.843 --> 04:12:41.246
MY DOOR REMAINS OPEN AND I WILL

04:12:41.312 --> 04:12:43.414

DILIGENTLY WITH US TO GET TO THE

PLACE THAT WE'RE AT. AS THE

04:13:17.482 --> 04:13:18.883
SENATOR SAID, MISCLASSIFICATION

04:13:18.950 --> 04:13:20.618
HAS BEEN PLAGUING OUR PORTS,

04:13:20.685 --> 04:13:22.053
PARTICULARLY THE TWO PORTS, IN

04:13:22.120 --> 04:13:25.290
THIS BILL FOR MANY DECADES. IT

04:13:25.356 --> 04:13:29.193
IS A PROBLEM THAT CAUSES A GREAT

04:13:29.260 --> 04:13:30.728
EXPLOITATION OF THE WORKFORCE

04:13:30.795 --> 04:13:32.564
THERE, THE DRAYAGE DRIVERS, AND

WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO ADDRESS IT

04:13:34.465 --> 04:13:35.333
WITH POLICIES THAT THIS

04:13:35.400 --> 04:13:38.570
LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED SEVERAL

04:13:38.636 --> 04:13:40.805
TIMES. AND WE ARE AT A PLACE NOW

04:13:40.872 --> 04:13:43.608
WHERE WE CAN GET EFFICIENT

04:13:43.675 --> 04:13:45.510
ENFORCEMENT IF WE JUST HAVE THE

04:13:45.577 --> 04:13:46.578
INFORMATION WE NEED. THAT'S WHAT

04:13:46.644 --> 04:13:48.646
THIS BILL DOES. AS THE SENATOR

04:13:48.713 --> 04:13:50.915
SAID, WE'VE WORKED VERY HARD

04:13:50.982 --> 04:13:52.850

04:13:52.917 --> 04:13:54.485

04:14:00.658 --> 04:14:01.859
PLACE WHERE WE CAN THEY CAN FEEL

04:14:01.926 --> 04:14:03.494
COMFORTABLE IMPLEMENTING THIS.

04:14:03.561 --> 04:14:06.798
THAT'S THE GOAL. WE JUST WANT TO

04:14:06.864 --> 04:14:08.700
PROTECT THE WORKFORCE. WE URGE

ENDEMIC MISCLASSIFICATION IN THE

JUST NOTE THAT WORKER

04:14:29.220 --> 04:14:30.121
MISCLASSIFICATION OFTEN BURDENS

04:14:30.188 --> 04:14:31.456
DRIVERS BY LEAVING THEM WITHOUT

04:14:31.522 --> 04:14:32.724
A SAFETY NET. WE'RE TALKING

04:14:32.790 --> 04:14:33.691
ABOUT EXEMPTING THEM FROM

REIMBURSEMENT FOR THEIR

TRUCKING COMPANIES OFTEN FORCE

04:14:42.800 --> 04:14:44.168
MISCLASSIFIED DRIVERS TO

04:14:44.235 --> 04:14:45.737
SHOULDER THEIR BUSINESS COSTS

04:14:45.803 --> 04:14:47.038
AND TO LEASE AND MAINTAIN A BIG

04:14:47.105 --> 04:14:49.107
RIG TRUCK AN OBLIGATION THAT IS

04:14:49.173 --> 04:14:50.642
NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR LOW WAGE

04:14:50.708 --> 04:14:52.310
DRIVERS TO AFFORD. THIS CAN

04:14:52.377 --> 04:14:53.911
OFTEN LEAVE DRIVERS SO INDEBTED

04:14:53.978 --> 04:14:55.346
TO THEIR BOSS THAT THEY END UP

04:14:55.413 --> 04:14:57.181
OWING MORE IN TRUCK AND

04:14:57.248 --> 04:14:58.316
OPERATING COSTS AT THE END OF

04:14:58.383 --> 04:14:59.951
THE WEEK THAN THEY HAVE EARNED

04:15:00.018 --> 04:15:02.286
IN WAGES. I ALSO WANTED TO NOTE

04:15:02.353 --> 04:15:02.854
THAT MISCLASSIFICATION ALSO

04:15:02.920 --> 04:15:04.022
CREATES AN UNFAIR COMPETITION

04:15:04.088 --> 04:15:04.989
FOR BUSINESSES THAT ACTUALLY

04:15:05.056 --> 04:15:06.658
FOLLOW THE LAW, AND IT CHEATS

04:15:06.724 --> 04:15:08.159
THE STATE, AS COMPANIES USE THIS

04:15:08.226 --> 04:15:09.093
PRACTICE TO AVOID TAXES AND

04:15:09.160 --> 04:15:11.162
DEPRIVE THE STATE OF MUCH NEEDED

04:15:11.229 --> 04:15:12.030
REVENUE. I'LL END THERE BY JUST

04:15:12.096 --> 04:15:14.032
SAYING THAT IF WE CAN ENSURE

04:15:14.098 --> 04:15:15.967
THAT THE PORTS IN LA AND LONG

04:15:16.034 --> 04:15:16.901
BEACH COLLECT THIS SPECIFIC,

04:15:16.968 --> 04:15:17.769
SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON TRUCKING

04:15:17.835 --> 04:15:18.703
COMPANIES ENTERING THEIR

04:15:18.770 --> 04:15:20.071
FACILITIES, CALIFORNIA CAN HELP

04:15:20.138 --> 04:15:21.606
STOP THIS ENDEMIC

04:15:21.673 --> 04:15:22.340
MISCLASSIFICATION AND ENSURE

04:15:22.407 --> 04:15:23.608
THAT DRIVERS ARE ADEQUATELY

04:15:23.675 --> 04:15:24.475
PROTECTED AND COMPENSATED FOR

04:15:24.542 --> 04:15:26.978
THEIR HARD WORK. THANK YOU SO

04:15:27.045 --> 04:15:29.514
MUCH AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR

04:15:29.580 --> 04:15:30.281
NAY VOTE. THANK YOU. NOW MOVING

04:15:30.348 --> 04:15:31.983
ON TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO

04:15:32.050 --> 04:15:33.484
WOULD LIKE TO ADD ON THEIR

04:15:33.551 --> 04:15:35.820
SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. NAME,

04:15:35.887 --> 04:15:39.223
AFFILIATION AND POSITION. SEEING

04:15:39.290 --> 04:15:41.793
NONE. MOVING TO WITNESSES IN

04:15:41.859 --> 04:15:43.795
OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. AS I

04:15:43.861 --> 04:15:44.595
UNDERSTAND IT, WE HAVE AN

04:15:44.662 --> 04:15:46.097
OPPOSITION THAT WAS ADDED ON

04:15:46.164 --> 04:15:48.599
FRIDAY, AND THE PORT OF LOS

04:15:48.666 --> 04:15:49.634
ANGELES WILL BE PROVIDING

04:15:49.701 --> 04:16:06.250
COMMENTS ACCORDINGLY.

04:16:06.317 --> 04:16:07.652
MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS, ANDREW

04:16:07.719 --> 04:16:09.120
ANTHONY, HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF

04:16:09.187 --> 04:16:10.922
THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES, THE

04:16:10.988 --> 04:16:12.457
PORT HAS ADOPTED AN OPPOSED,

04:16:12.523 --> 04:16:14.559
UNLESS AMENDED, POSITION ON SB

04:16:14.625 --> 04:16:17.061
703. RICHARDSON BUT BEFORE I

04:16:17.128 --> 04:16:18.863
PROCEED, I WANT TO THANK THE

04:16:18.930 --> 04:16:19.430
AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS FOR

04:16:19.497 --> 04:16:21.365
THEIR OPEN DOOR POLICY AND

04:16:21.432 --> 04:16:22.900
ONGOING COMMUNICATION. THIS

04:16:22.967 --> 04:16:24.135
STARTED OFF AS A BILL THAT

04:16:24.202 --> 04:16:25.636
APPLIED TO ALL THE WEST COAST

04:16:25.703 --> 04:16:27.839
PORTS IN CALIFORNIA, AND HAS

04:16:27.905 --> 04:16:29.273
BEEN NARROWED TO ONLY APPLY TO

04:16:29.340 --> 04:16:31.442
LA AND LONG BEACH. SO WE DO. WE

04:16:31.509 --> 04:16:33.544
ARE THANKFUL FOR THE ONGOING

04:16:33.611 --> 04:16:34.879
COMMUNICATION, BUT UNFORTUNATELY

04:16:34.946 --> 04:16:36.514
WE BELIEVE THAT MORE WORK MUST

04:16:36.581 --> 04:16:39.050
BE DONE BEFORE THIS CAN

04:16:39.117 --> 04:16:40.384
ACCOMPLISH. THE AUTHOR AND THE

04:16:40.451 --> 04:16:42.286
SPONSOR STATED GOALS. WE'RE

04:16:42.353 --> 04:16:43.421
SEEKING ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS

04:16:43.488 --> 04:16:45.456
AND WE HOPE THAT WILL BE

04:16:45.523 --> 04:16:46.524
INCLUDED IN THE BILL BEFORE

04:16:46.591 --> 04:16:49.360
FINAL PASSAGE. WE HAVE BETWEEN

04:16:49.427 --> 04:16:51.162
THE TWO PORTS ROUGHLY 20,000

04:16:51.229 --> 04:16:53.297
DAILY TRUCK TRIPS AT THE SAN

04:16:53.364 --> 04:16:55.767
PEDRO BAY PORTS. THE PROVISIONS

04:16:55.833 --> 04:16:58.302
IN SB 703 AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED,

04:16:58.369 --> 04:16:59.504
EVEN WITH THE AMENDMENTS ADOPTED

04:16:59.570 --> 04:17:01.272
BY THE COMMITTEE, AND ADMITTEDLY

04:17:01.339 --> 04:17:03.107
THOSE WERE BASED ON

04:17:03.174 --> 04:17:04.776
COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR

04:17:04.842 --> 04:17:06.077
AND SPONSORS. WE'RE CONCERNED

04:17:06.144 --> 04:17:08.412
THAT THIS COULD LEAD TO DELAYS

04:17:08.479 --> 04:17:10.381
AT THE PORT AT A TIME THAT'S

04:17:10.448 --> 04:17:12.717
VERY CRITICAL AND UNCERTAIN.

04:17:12.784 --> 04:17:14.552
IT'S IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT

04:17:14.619 --> 04:17:17.088
CARGO FLUIDITY AT OUR PORTS

04:17:17.155 --> 04:17:19.590
REMAINS ROBUST BECAUSE OF THE

04:17:19.657 --> 04:17:20.925
UNCERTAINTY IN INTERNATIONAL

04:17:20.992 --> 04:17:23.561
TRADE MARKET CONDITIONS.

04:17:23.628 --> 04:17:24.662
CURRENTLY, THE PORT DOES NOT

04:17:24.729 --> 04:17:26.097
COLLECT OR HAVE A SYSTEM IN

04:17:26.164 --> 04:17:29.000
PLACE TO COLLECT DRIVER SPECIFIC

04:17:29.066 --> 04:17:31.736
INFORMATION THAT ENTER TERMINALS

04:17:31.803 --> 04:17:33.337
AT PORTS. TODAY, WHEN A TRUCK

04:17:33.404 --> 04:17:35.239
DRIVER COMES TO THE PORT, A

04:17:35.306 --> 04:17:36.641
SECURITY GUARD VERIFIES BY

04:17:36.707 --> 04:17:38.009
PERSONAL EXAMINATION THAT THE

04:17:38.075 --> 04:17:41.179
DRIVER HAS A VALID FEDERALLY

04:17:41.245 --> 04:17:43.648
ISSUED TRANSPORTATION WORKER

04:17:43.714 --> 04:17:45.149
IDENTIFICATION CARD OR TWIC

04:17:45.216 --> 04:17:47.185
CARD. ANY NEW MANDATE THAT WOULD

04:17:47.251 --> 04:17:48.753
REQUIRE THE PORTS TO COLLECT

04:17:48.820 --> 04:17:51.556
DRIVER DATA WOULD REQUIRE A NEW

04:17:51.622 --> 04:17:53.758
COLLECTION PROCESS WITH

04:17:53.825 --> 04:17:56.327
POTENTIAL DELAYS AT TERMINAL

04:17:56.394 --> 04:17:58.362
GATES AND SIGNIFICANT

04:17:58.429 --> 04:18:00.498
INVESTMENTS TO DEVELOP A NEW

04:18:00.565 --> 04:18:02.033
SYSTEM TO GATHER INFORMATION ON

04:18:02.099 --> 04:18:04.569
EACH DRIVER THAT ENTERS THE PORT

04:18:04.635 --> 04:18:06.470
COMPLEX. IN ADDITION TO THE COST

04:18:06.537 --> 04:18:08.172
AND TIME TO DEVELOP A NEW

04:18:08.239 --> 04:18:09.540
SYSTEM, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A

04:18:09.607 --> 04:18:11.709
NEW SYSTEM WOULD CREATE

04:18:11.776 --> 04:18:12.310
SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES. WE'LL

04:18:12.376 --> 04:18:14.879
HAVE TO HAVE YOU WRAP UP. I

04:18:14.946 --> 04:18:16.647
WOULD JUST ADD THAT THE PROPOSAL

04:18:16.714 --> 04:18:18.115
WOULD BE SIMILAR TO REQUIRING

04:18:18.182 --> 04:18:19.217
THE BAY AREA TOLL AUTHORITY TO

04:18:19.283 --> 04:18:20.618
DEVELOP A SYSTEM THAT WOULD

04:18:20.685 --> 04:18:22.954
REQUIRE THEM TO HAVE VEHICLE

04:18:23.020 --> 04:18:24.422
INFORMATION REGARDING INSURANCE

04:18:24.488 --> 04:18:25.590
FOR EACH DRIVER WHO APPROACHES

04:18:25.656 --> 04:18:27.592
THE TOLL GATE BEFORE CROSSING

04:18:27.658 --> 04:18:29.327
THE BAY BRIDGE FOR THE REST OF

04:18:29.393 --> 04:18:31.796
THE TIME. FOR EACH YEAR ON AN

04:18:31.863 --> 04:18:32.997
ANNUAL BASIS, POLAR RECOGNIZES

04:18:33.064 --> 04:18:34.832
THE IMPORTANCE OF SAFE WORKING

04:18:34.899 --> 04:18:36.601
CONDITIONS AND THE NEGATIVE

04:18:36.667 --> 04:18:38.302
CONSEQUENCES OF WORKER

04:18:38.369 --> 04:18:39.403
MISCLASSIFICATIONS. WE SHARE THE

04:18:39.470 --> 04:18:41.772
GOALS, BUT WE JUST NEED A

04:18:41.839 --> 04:18:44.508
WORKABLE SOLUTION. THANK YOU.

04:18:44.575 --> 04:18:46.010
ALL RIGHT. WE HAVE THE RIGHT

04:18:46.077 --> 04:18:47.411
WITNESS. MADAM CHAIR, MEMBERS,

04:18:47.478 --> 04:18:49.447
ON BEHALF OF THE PORT OF LONG

04:18:49.513 --> 04:18:50.314
BEACH. FIRST OFF, I WANT TO

04:18:50.381 --> 04:18:51.883
EXPRESS OUR SINCERE APOLOGIES

04:18:51.949 --> 04:18:52.817
FOR GETTING A LATE OPPOSITION

04:18:52.884 --> 04:18:55.186
INTO THE COMMITTEE ON BEHALF OF

04:18:55.253 --> 04:18:57.088
THE PORT, WE REGRETTABLY HAVEN'T

04:18:57.154 --> 04:18:58.189
OPPOSED, UNLESS AMENDED,

04:18:58.256 --> 04:19:00.291
POSITION ON THIS BILL DUE TO THE

04:19:00.358 --> 04:19:02.026
UNDUE BURDEN IT WOULD IMPOSE ON

04:19:02.093 --> 04:19:04.028
THE PORTS OF LONG BEACH IN LOS

04:19:04.095 --> 04:19:05.329
ANGELES. BUT WE'RE GREATLY

04:19:05.396 --> 04:19:06.497
APPRECIATIVE OF THE AUTHOR ON

04:19:06.564 --> 04:19:08.232
THE SPONSOR FOR THEIR EXTENSIVE

04:19:08.299 --> 04:19:09.700
ENGAGEMENT WITH US AND FOR

04:19:09.767 --> 04:19:11.102
RECENT AMENDMENTS IN RESPONSE TO

04:19:11.168 --> 04:19:13.437
SOME OF OUR CONCERNS. ALSO FOR

04:19:13.504 --> 04:19:15.139
THE TO THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE

04:19:15.206 --> 04:19:16.507
STAFF AND FOR THE COMMITTEE

04:19:16.574 --> 04:19:18.342
AMENDMENTS AND THE AUTHOR'S

04:19:18.409 --> 04:19:19.810
COMMITMENT TO WORK WITH US AS

04:19:19.877 --> 04:19:22.213
THIS BILL MOVES. PORT OF LONG

04:19:22.280 --> 04:19:23.648
BEACH TAKES WORKER

04:19:23.714 --> 04:19:25.483
CLASSIFICATION CONCERNS VERY

04:19:25.549 --> 04:19:26.984
SERIOUSLY, AND WE SUPPORT THE

04:19:27.051 --> 04:19:28.819
INTENT OF THE AUTHOR AND

04:19:28.886 --> 04:19:30.988
SPONSORS. HOWEVER, AS DRAFTED SB

04:19:31.055 --> 04:19:32.290
703 WOULD PRESENT MAJOR

04:19:32.356 --> 04:19:34.158
OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES FOR THE

04:19:34.225 --> 04:19:36.360
PORTS. AS MENTIONED BY THE PORT

04:19:36.427 --> 04:19:39.230
OF PORT OF LA WITNESS, OUR TWO

04:19:39.297 --> 04:19:42.133
PORTS SEE ABOUT 20,000 TRUCKS A

04:19:42.199 --> 04:19:43.534
DAY, AND WE CURRENTLY

04:19:43.601 --> 04:19:44.969
EXPERIENCING HIGHLY UNCERTAIN

04:19:45.036 --> 04:19:46.737
CARGO VOLUMES. GIVEN

04:19:46.804 --> 04:19:48.172
UNPRECEDENTED ACTIONS AT THE

04:19:48.239 --> 04:19:50.574
FEDERAL LEVEL. IN THE MIDST OF

04:19:50.641 --> 04:19:51.542
THESE CHALLENGES, THIS BILL

04:19:51.609 --> 04:19:52.944
IMPOSES NEW NEW DUTIES ON THE

04:19:53.010 --> 04:19:55.079
PORTS TO COLLECT CERTAIN DRIVER

04:19:55.146 --> 04:19:56.213
INFORMATION AND TO REPORT IT TO

04:19:56.280 --> 04:19:58.683
THE LABOR COMMISSIONER. IT ALSO

04:19:58.749 --> 04:20:00.051
REQUIRES US TO RECEIVE DATA FROM

04:20:00.117 --> 04:20:01.552
TRUCKING COMPANIES, AND TO

04:20:01.619 --> 04:20:03.321
DEVELOP A SYSTEM TO MANAGE AND

04:20:03.387 --> 04:20:04.989
POST IT, WHICH CURRENTLY DOES

04:20:05.056 --> 04:20:08.326
NOT EXIST. BECAUSE SB 703 GIVES

04:20:08.392 --> 04:20:09.727
ENFORCEMENT RESPONSIBILITY TO

04:20:09.794 --> 04:20:11.395
THE LABOR COMMISSIONER, WE'RE

04:20:11.462 --> 04:20:12.663
ASKING THE BILL BE AMENDED TO

04:20:12.730 --> 04:20:14.465
HAVE THE LABOR COMMISSIONER OR

04:20:14.532 --> 04:20:16.267

04:20:18.235 --> 04:20:19.971
DRIVER DATA INSTEAD OF THE

04:20:20.037 --> 04:20:22.640
PORTS. ADDITIONALLY, WE ASK THAT

04:20:22.707 --> 04:20:24.141
THE BILL'S EFFECTIVE DATE BE

04:20:24.208 --> 04:20:26.711

AFTERNOON, NICK CHAPPIE WITH THE

04:21:17.094 --> 04:21:18.562
CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION.

04:21:18.629 --> 04:21:20.364
WE HAVE REMOVED OUR OPPOSITION

04:21:20.431 --> 04:21:22.033
TO THE BILL, AS AMENDED AND

04:21:22.099 --> 04:21:24.435
GREATLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR,

04:21:24.502 --> 04:21:27.905
THE SPONSORS AND THE COMMITTEE

04:21:27.972 --> 04:21:30.741
FOR WORKING WITH US. THANK YOU,

04:21:30.808 --> 04:21:33.244
THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT, MOVING ON

04:21:33.310 --> 04:21:35.312
TO NOW TO COMMITTEES FOR

04:21:35.379 --> 04:21:36.313
COMMENTS, QUESTIONS, CONCERNS. I

04:21:36.380 --> 04:21:38.149
SEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROGERS

04:21:38.215 --> 04:21:41.485
FOLLOWED BY JACKSON. THANK YOU

04:21:41.552 --> 04:21:43.788
SO MUCH. SO JUST A QUICK

04:21:43.854 --> 04:21:44.755
QUESTION. LISTENING TO THE

04:21:44.822 --> 04:21:46.123
OPPOSITION AND UNDERSTANDING

04:21:46.190 --> 04:21:47.324
THAT IT'S COMING IN LATE, IT

04:21:47.391 --> 04:21:49.827
SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF THE DATA

04:21:49.894 --> 04:21:51.362
THAT IS COLLECTED IS ALREADY

04:21:51.429 --> 04:21:53.864
COLLECTED BY STATE AGENCIES.

04:21:53.931 --> 04:21:55.366
HAVE YOU CONTEMPLATED, INSTEAD

04:21:55.433 --> 04:21:57.401
OF PUTTING THE ONUS ON THE

04:21:57.468 --> 04:21:59.804
PORTS, PUTTING THE ONUS ON STATE

04:21:59.870 --> 04:22:00.504
AGENCIES THAT ARE ALREADY

04:22:00.571 --> 04:22:03.240
REQUIRED TO HAVE SOME OF THAT

04:22:03.307 --> 04:22:04.408
DATA? AND I'D BE OPEN TO HEARING

04:22:04.475 --> 04:22:06.477
IF THAT WOULD WORK OR WHY THAT

04:22:06.544 --> 04:22:08.012
WOULDN'T WORK. BUT IT SEEMS LIKE

04:22:08.079 --> 04:22:09.980
THAT MIGHT SATISFY MANY OF THE

04:22:10.047 --> 04:22:14.185
CONCERNS THAT I'M HEARING. THANK

04:22:14.251 --> 04:22:16.587
YOU FOR THE QUESTION. WE HAVE

04:22:16.654 --> 04:22:19.090
CONSIDERED OTHER WAYS OF

04:22:19.156 --> 04:22:20.791
FACILITATING THE COLLECTION OF

04:22:20.858 --> 04:22:21.959
THIS INFORMATION. I THINK PART

04:22:22.026 --> 04:22:25.229
OF THE ISSUE IS, AS WE INTRODUCE

04:22:25.296 --> 04:22:26.931
THE BILL, WE HAD IT DRAFTED A

04:22:26.997 --> 04:22:29.467
CERTAIN WAY. WE TOOK AMENDMENTS

04:22:29.533 --> 04:22:30.267
FOR A LOT OF FOLKS WHO WERE

04:22:30.334 --> 04:22:32.169
OPPOSED TO THE BILL WHEN WE

04:22:32.236 --> 04:22:33.671
SUGGESTED GOING TO A DIFFERENT

04:22:33.737 --> 04:22:35.172
APPROACH FOR COLLECTION OF

04:22:35.239 --> 04:22:36.107
INFORMATION, IT WOULD HAVE

04:22:36.173 --> 04:22:37.374
BROUGHT ALL OF THOSE OPPONENTS

04:22:37.441 --> 04:22:40.611
BACK ONTO THE BILL. SO I THINK

04:22:40.678 --> 04:22:42.213
THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE NEED SOME

04:22:42.279 --> 04:22:44.248
TIME TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE

04:22:44.315 --> 04:22:46.750
BEST METHOD. I WOULD SAY THAT

04:22:46.817 --> 04:22:48.652
OUR VIEW IS IT IS APPROPRIATE

04:22:48.719 --> 04:22:50.020
FOR THE PORTS TO COLLECT THIS

04:22:50.087 --> 04:22:51.422
INFORMATION. THEY'RE A TENANT. I

04:22:51.489 --> 04:22:53.224
MEAN, THEY'RE THE LANDLORD OF A

04:22:53.290 --> 04:22:56.160
PROPERTY WHERE A LOT OF ILLEGAL

04:22:56.227 --> 04:22:57.828
ACTIVITY IS OCCURRING. AND I

04:22:57.895 --> 04:23:00.831
THINK WE WOULD WANT MOST LOCAL

04:23:00.898 --> 04:23:03.734
GOVERNMENTS AND AGENCIES TO AT

04:23:03.801 --> 04:23:06.303
LEAST ATTEMPT TO POLICE THE

04:23:06.370 --> 04:23:07.204
KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE

04:23:07.271 --> 04:23:09.440
HAPPENING ON THEIR PROPERTY.

04:23:09.507 --> 04:23:12.710
OKAY. I HAVE TWO BRIEF RESPONSES

04:23:12.776 --> 04:23:14.778
TO THAT. FIRST OF ALL, WE

04:23:14.845 --> 04:23:15.946
RECEIVED THE OPPOSITION ON

04:23:16.013 --> 04:23:18.849
FRIDAY AND TODAY IS MONDAY. SO

04:23:18.916 --> 04:23:20.584
WE'VE WORKED ON THIS BILL FOR

04:23:20.651 --> 04:23:22.052
SEVEN MONTHS AND WE'RE MORE THAN

04:23:22.119 --> 04:23:24.221
HAPPY AND OPEN TO WHATEVER

04:23:24.288 --> 04:23:25.589
AMENDMENTS THAT THEY HAVE GOING

04:23:25.656 --> 04:23:27.758
FORWARD FOR US TO WORK BETWEEN

04:23:27.825 --> 04:23:29.293
NOW AND FINISHING THE BILL IN

04:23:29.360 --> 04:23:32.163
THE NORMAL PROCESS. AND THEY AND

04:23:32.229 --> 04:23:34.798
YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT TO DO SO.

04:23:34.865 --> 04:23:36.133
WHAT I WOULD SAY TO YOU THAT WE

04:23:36.200 --> 04:23:38.335
HAVE TO BE CAREFUL, WE REALIZE

04:23:38.402 --> 04:23:39.870
THAT THIS IS A STRETCH FOR THE

04:23:39.937 --> 04:23:41.972
PORTS. THE PORTS JOB IS TO MOVE

04:23:42.039 --> 04:23:44.074
THAT CARGO AND WE GET IT.

04:23:44.141 --> 04:23:45.709
HOWEVER, ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS

04:23:45.776 --> 04:23:47.978
IF YOU'RE ASKING A STATE AGENCY

04:23:48.045 --> 04:23:49.747
TO COLLECT THE DATA, SOMEONE

04:23:49.813 --> 04:23:51.282
JUST SIMPLY, YOU KNOW, SENDING

04:23:51.348 --> 04:23:52.917
IN A BUNCH OF DRIVER'S LICENSES

04:23:52.983 --> 04:23:55.519
AND TWIC CARDS IS NOT GETTING TO

04:23:55.586 --> 04:23:56.654
THE POINT. THE PORTS ARE THE

04:23:56.720 --> 04:23:58.022
ONES THAT ACTUALLY WHEN THOSE

04:23:58.088 --> 04:24:00.191
TRUCKS COME IN, THEY'RE SCANNING

04:24:00.257 --> 04:24:02.426
THOSE LICENSE PLATES, THEY'RE

04:24:02.493 --> 04:24:04.195
SCANNING THE TWIC CARDS. THEY'RE

04:24:04.261 --> 04:24:05.896
THE ONES THAT ARE COLLECTING ALL

04:24:05.963 --> 04:24:08.132
THIS INFORMATION, NOT IN THE

04:24:08.199 --> 04:24:09.967
SENSE OF ULTIMATELY THE DATA OF

04:24:10.034 --> 04:24:12.136
HOW WE NEED TO USE IT, BUT THEY

04:24:12.203 --> 04:24:13.871
ARE THE ONES, MORE THAN ANYONE

04:24:13.938 --> 04:24:15.973
THAT ACTUALLY HAS SOME OF THAT

04:24:16.040 --> 04:24:17.675
DATA. AND THAT'S WHY THE PORTS

04:24:17.741 --> 04:24:20.311
WERE SELECTED. BUT WE CERTAINLY

04:24:20.377 --> 04:24:23.280
IN NO WAY WANT TO HINDER THE

04:24:23.347 --> 04:24:24.682
PORTS ACTIVITY. AND WE'LL

04:24:24.748 --> 04:24:27.151
CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE BEST

04:24:27.218 --> 04:24:29.453
SOLUTION. BUT THAT IS THE REASON

04:24:29.520 --> 04:24:31.522
WHY THE PORTS ARE SELECTED. NO

04:24:31.589 --> 04:24:33.290
TRUCK, NO DRIVER GETS ON THAT

04:24:33.357 --> 04:24:35.159
PORT WITHOUT IT GOING THROUGH

04:24:35.226 --> 04:24:37.027
SOME INFORMATION THAT THEY'RE

04:24:37.094 --> 04:24:38.028
PRESENTING. AND THAT'S WHY THEY

04:24:38.095 --> 04:24:40.764
ARE BEST POSITIONED TO GIVE US

04:24:40.831 --> 04:24:42.266
THE INFORMATION. AND OUTSIDE

04:24:42.333 --> 04:24:44.802
AGENCY LOCATED WHERE, YOU KNOW,

04:24:44.868 --> 04:24:46.770
THAT WOULD REALLY GET AWAY FROM

04:24:46.837 --> 04:24:49.173
THE ULTIMATE PROBLEM, WHICH IS

04:24:49.240 --> 04:24:50.441
MAKING SURE THAT THE WORKERS,

04:24:50.507 --> 04:24:52.776
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DRIVING THOSE

04:24:52.843 --> 04:24:54.745
TRUCKS, THAT WE HAVE THE

04:24:54.812 --> 04:24:55.980
ACCURATE INFORMATION. AND OH, BY

04:24:56.046 --> 04:24:57.982
THE WAY, WHY IS

04:24:58.048 --> 04:24:59.250
MISCLASSIFICATION SO IMPORTANT?

04:24:59.316 --> 04:25:01.318
IT WAS TALK WE HEARD WITH ONE OF

04:25:01.385 --> 04:25:03.153
THE WITNESSES TALKING ABOUT

04:25:03.220 --> 04:25:05.122
FIXING THE TRUCKS. THESE TRUCKS

04:25:05.189 --> 04:25:06.857
ARE CARRYING HEAVY LOADS AND

04:25:06.924 --> 04:25:09.326
THEY'RE GOING ON HIGHWAYS AND

04:25:09.393 --> 04:25:11.362
PEOPLE CAN GET HURT. AND SO IT'S

04:25:11.428 --> 04:25:13.197
IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

04:25:13.264 --> 04:25:14.832
DRIVERS ARE PROPERLY AND

04:25:14.898 --> 04:25:15.933
COMPANIES THAT ARE BENEFITING

04:25:16.000 --> 04:25:18.002
FROM THESE DRIVERS ARE MAKING

04:25:18.068 --> 04:25:19.803
SURE THAT THE TRUCKS ARE

04:25:19.870 --> 04:25:21.639
PROPERLY SERVICED, MAINTAINED TO

04:25:21.705 --> 04:25:23.741
PROTECT THE PUBLIC. THANK YOU.

04:25:23.807 --> 04:25:26.310
YEAH. AND I DIDN'T HEAR ANYBODY

04:25:26.377 --> 04:25:27.711
DISAGREE WITH THE INTENT OF THE

04:25:27.778 --> 04:25:30.180
BILL. I THINK I CERTAINLY AGREE

04:25:30.247 --> 04:25:32.049
WITH THE INTENT OF THE BILL. AND

04:25:32.116 --> 04:25:34.218
I'LL BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT TODAY.

04:25:34.285 --> 04:25:34.885
AND GIVEN THAT ESPECIALLY THAT

04:25:34.952 --> 04:25:35.986
IT'S LATE OPPOSITION ON ON

04:25:36.053 --> 04:25:38.322
FRIDAY, I HOPE YOU WILL CONTINUE

04:25:38.389 --> 04:25:39.223
TO WORK WITH FOLKS. IT SEEMS

04:25:39.290 --> 04:25:40.190
LIKE THIS MIGHT BE AN EASY

04:25:40.257 --> 04:25:42.359
CIRCLE TO SQUARE AND MIGHT BE

04:25:42.426 --> 04:25:43.994
ABLE TO GET ON THE SAME PAGE

04:25:44.061 --> 04:25:46.063
BECAUSE I HEARD THE INTENT FROM

04:25:46.130 --> 04:25:47.831
THE PORTS AS WELL. TO MAKE SURE

04:25:47.898 --> 04:25:49.033
THAT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE FOLKS

04:25:49.099 --> 04:25:50.668
WHO ARE MISCLASSIFIED AND YOU

04:25:50.734 --> 04:25:51.835
HAVE THE RIGHT PEOPLE DOING THE

04:25:51.902 --> 04:25:53.537
WORK. YES, SIR. JACKSON THEN

04:25:53.604 --> 04:25:56.707
CARILLO. THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR.

04:25:56.774 --> 04:25:59.743
I JUST WANTED TO ECHO MY

04:25:59.810 --> 04:26:02.913
COLLEAGUE IN REGARDS TO THIS

04:26:02.980 --> 04:26:05.516
BILL. OBVIOUSLY, A VERY

04:26:05.582 --> 04:26:07.685
IMPORTANT BILL TO ENSURE THAT

04:26:07.751 --> 04:26:09.386
FAIR LABOR PRACTICES ARE BEING

04:26:09.453 --> 04:26:11.322
FOLLOWED. PEOPLE ARE NOT BEING

04:26:11.388 --> 04:26:12.756
MISCLASSIFIED, BUT AT THE SAME

04:26:12.823 --> 04:26:15.926
TIME, UNDERSTANDING THE

04:26:15.993 --> 04:26:17.328
REGULATORY AND INTERNATIONAL

04:26:17.394 --> 04:26:18.762
TRADE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE FIND

04:26:18.829 --> 04:26:19.963
OURSELVES IN, WE REALLY GOT TO

04:26:20.030 --> 04:26:22.800
GET THIS RIGHT. RIGHT. AND

04:26:22.866 --> 04:26:23.767
UNDERSTANDING THE TARIFFS,

04:26:23.834 --> 04:26:24.935
UNDERSTANDING ALL THE OTHER

04:26:25.002 --> 04:26:26.236
THINGS THAT ARE CIRCULATING

04:26:26.303 --> 04:26:29.239
AROUND THIS, THIS ISSUE. AND

04:26:29.306 --> 04:26:30.407
CERTAINLY I HEAR THAT YOU ARE

04:26:30.474 --> 04:26:32.009
COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK

04:26:32.076 --> 04:26:34.311
WITH OPPOSITION. I WOULD ALSO

04:26:34.378 --> 04:26:35.679
STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF DOING

04:26:35.746 --> 04:26:38.115
SO, BUT WE OBVIOUSLY NEED TO GET

04:26:38.182 --> 04:26:40.117
THIS RIGHT AND MAKING SURE THAT

04:26:40.184 --> 04:26:42.986
PEOPLE ARE BENEFITING FROM THE

04:26:43.053 --> 04:26:45.889
ROBUST, ROBUST ECONOMIC

04:26:45.956 --> 04:26:47.191
OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE COMING

04:26:47.257 --> 04:26:48.392
FROM THE PORTS. AND CERTAINLY WE

04:26:48.459 --> 04:26:50.527
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE

04:26:50.594 --> 04:26:52.229
ARE BEING PAID RIGHT, TREATED

04:26:52.296 --> 04:26:54.431
RIGHT AT THE SAME TIME, BUT

04:26:54.498 --> 04:26:55.866
CERTAINLY UNDERSTANDING THAT WE

04:26:55.933 --> 04:26:57.334
ALWAYS HAVE TO BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT

04:26:57.401 --> 04:26:59.737
WHAT WE'RE DOING AT THE PORTS,

04:26:59.803 --> 04:27:02.740
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THAT ECONOMIC

04:27:02.806 --> 04:27:04.508
OPPORTUNITY STARTS IN MY

04:27:04.575 --> 04:27:06.343
COLLEAGUE'S DISTRICT IN LONG

04:27:06.410 --> 04:27:08.912
BEACH, BUT THEN HAS RIPPLE

04:27:08.979 --> 04:27:10.247
EFFECTS IN MY DISTRICT IN THE

04:27:10.314 --> 04:27:12.416
INLAND EMPIRE. AND SO WE WANT TO

04:27:12.483 --> 04:27:14.885
MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE HAVING ALL

04:27:14.952 --> 04:27:16.553
EYES ON THIS. BUT THANK YOU SO

CONTINUING TO AND THANK THE

04:27:24.061 --> 04:27:25.028

04:27:29.867 --> 04:27:31.001
MADAM CHAIR, I'D LIKE TO MOVE

04:27:31.068 --> 04:27:32.436
THE BILL. I THINK IT HAS A

04:27:32.503 --> 04:27:34.805
MOTION. AARONS AND RANSOM. BUT

04:27:34.872 --> 04:27:36.940
YOU'RE THE THIRD. THERE WE GO.

04:27:37.007 --> 04:27:38.008
CARILLO. ACTUALLY, THAT WAS KIND

04:27:38.075 --> 04:27:40.511
OF MY THINKING OF MAKING A

04:27:40.577 --> 04:27:41.612
COMMENT BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER

04:27:41.678 --> 04:27:43.514

THAT THERE IS A MOTION. AND A

04:27:57.094 --> 04:27:58.529
SECOND BEFORE I GIVE AN

04:27:58.595 --> 04:27:59.563
OPPORTUNITY TO CLOSE, I'LL NOTE

I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO

04:28:02.633 --> 04:28:03.934
TRUCK DRIVER TRANSPARENCY IN

04:28:04.001 --> 04:28:05.302
ORDER TO HIGHLIGHT THOSE WHO MAY

04:28:05.369 --> 04:28:07.571

US ON THIS BILL. COLLEAGUES, SB

04:30:55.305 --> 04:30:58.175
445, THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS

04:30:58.241 --> 04:30:59.076
TO BE ABLE TO SPEED UP THE

04:30:59.142 --> 04:31:01.044
PROCESS FOR TRANSIT PROJECTS TO

04:31:01.111 --> 04:31:03.580
GET THEIR PERMITS AND BE ABLE TO

04:31:03.647 --> 04:31:05.148
BE IMPLEMENTED. THE ORIGINAL

04:31:05.215 --> 04:31:07.918
VERSION OF THE BILL INCLUDED ALL

04:31:07.985 --> 04:31:11.388
TRANSIT PROJECTS, PARTICULARLY

04:31:11.455 --> 04:31:15.392
RAIL PROJECTS. IT IS NOW FOCUSED

04:31:15.459 --> 04:31:18.996
ON HIGH SPEED RAIL WHEN. WHEN I

04:31:19.062 --> 04:31:21.531
INITIALLY STARTED ON THIS ON

04:31:21.598 --> 04:31:24.501
THIS BILL, I ACTUALLY DID NOT

04:31:24.568 --> 04:31:25.936
INITIALLY HAVE HIGH SPEED RAIL

04:31:26.003 --> 04:31:28.472
IN MIND WHERE IT WAS FOCUSED ON

04:31:28.538 --> 04:31:29.973
THESE MORE REGIONAL PROJECTS

04:31:30.040 --> 04:31:31.208
THAN WE REALIZE, THAT HIGH SPEED

04:31:31.274 --> 04:31:33.043
RAIL WAS VERY IMPLICATED, THAT

04:31:33.110 --> 04:31:35.345
WE HAVE A SITUATION AND HIGH

04:31:35.412 --> 04:31:37.381
SPEED RAIL REALLY EXEMPLIFIES

04:31:37.447 --> 04:31:39.383
IT, WHERE WE DECIDE WE WANT TO

04:31:39.449 --> 04:31:42.886
DO A PROJECT, WE IT GETS

04:31:42.953 --> 04:31:45.055
APPROVED, SQL CLEARED, ETC. WE

04:31:45.122 --> 04:31:47.090
GET WE PUT FUNDING IN AND WE'RE

04:31:47.157 --> 04:31:48.592
LIKE, OKAY, LET'S GO, LET'S DO,

04:31:48.659 --> 04:31:50.027
LET'S IMPLEMENT THE PROJECT THAT

04:31:50.093 --> 04:31:52.629
WE HAVE DECIDED AS A STATE THAT

04:31:52.696 --> 04:31:54.464
WE WANT TO DO AND THAT WE'RE

04:31:54.531 --> 04:31:57.567
PUTTING TAXPAYER MONEY INTO. AND

04:31:57.634 --> 04:32:00.470
THEN THEY HAVE TO GET ENDLESS

04:32:00.537 --> 04:32:02.606
PERMITS FROM EVERY CONCEIVABLE

04:32:02.673 --> 04:32:05.142
LOCAL JURISDICTION, FROM

04:32:05.208 --> 04:32:06.410
UTILITIES. THEY HAVE TO GET

04:32:06.476 --> 04:32:08.011
PERMISSION FROM TELECOMS AND

04:32:08.078 --> 04:32:10.580
CABLE COMPANIES TO MOVE A WIRE.

04:32:10.647 --> 04:32:13.750
AND SO YOU HAVE A, A SOMETHING

04:32:13.817 --> 04:32:15.619
THAT'S AN APPROVED, FUNDED

04:32:15.686 --> 04:32:18.855
PROJECT. AND WITH A MILLION

04:32:18.922 --> 04:32:20.724
VETOES AND CHOKE POINTS WHERE IF

04:32:20.791 --> 04:32:22.359
ANY, PERMITTING AUTHORITY OR

04:32:22.426 --> 04:32:24.127
UTILITY OR TELECOM OR CABLE

04:32:24.194 --> 04:32:27.397
COMPANY JUST DOESN'T RESPOND OR

04:32:27.464 --> 04:32:29.633
DELAYS OR JUST DRAGS THEIR FEET,

04:32:29.700 --> 04:32:30.934
ALL OF A SUDDEN THE PROJECT CAN

04:32:31.001 --> 04:32:32.969
COME TO A HALT. AND WE HAVE SEEN

04:32:33.036 --> 04:32:35.338
WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL AT TIMES

04:32:35.405 --> 04:32:38.275
THAT THEY HAVE HAD TO DEMOBILIZE

04:32:38.341 --> 04:32:39.276
CONTRACTORS BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO

04:32:39.342 --> 04:32:41.511
BUILD LIKE A LITTLE BRIDGE OVER

04:32:41.578 --> 04:32:44.715
A GULLY SOMEWHERE, AND THERE IS

04:32:44.781 --> 04:32:47.284
SOME ENTITY THAT IS JUST NOT

04:32:47.350 --> 04:32:49.086
RESPONDING. AND THAT'S NOT HOW

04:32:49.152 --> 04:32:50.187
GOVERNMENT SHOULD WORK. AND WE

04:32:50.253 --> 04:32:52.255
KNOW THAT WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL,

04:32:52.322 --> 04:32:53.757
WHATEVER ONE'S VIEW ON HIGH

04:32:53.824 --> 04:32:55.826
SPEED RAIL, I HAPPEN TO BE A

04:32:55.892 --> 04:32:57.661
STRONG SUPPORTER. I THINK IT'S

04:32:57.728 --> 04:32:59.262
MORTIFYING THAT TO GET TO FROM

04:32:59.329 --> 04:33:02.032
THE BAY AREA TO LA BY TRAIN

04:33:02.099 --> 04:33:03.800
TAKES TWICE AS LONG AS BY CAR.

04:33:03.867 --> 04:33:04.968
IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT WAY. WE

04:33:05.035 --> 04:33:06.737
SHOULD HAVE A STATEWIDE RAIL

04:33:06.803 --> 04:33:08.505
SYSTEM, BUT REGARDLESS OF WHAT

04:33:08.572 --> 04:33:11.375
ONE'S VIEW ON THE PROJECT, AS A

04:33:11.441 --> 04:33:12.876
MATTER OF GOOD GOVERNMENT, WE

04:33:12.943 --> 04:33:14.244
SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY

04:33:14.311 --> 04:33:17.047
DELIVER IT. AND SO SB 445 IS AN

04:33:17.114 --> 04:33:19.616
EFFORT TO DO THAT. THE BILL

04:33:19.683 --> 04:33:22.085
STARTED OUT IN ITS ORIGINAL

04:33:22.152 --> 04:33:23.920
FORM, PUTTING A 30 DAY SHOT

04:33:23.987 --> 04:33:25.789
CLOCK ON ALL THESE PERMITS AND

04:33:25.856 --> 04:33:27.958
PERMISSIONS. THE BILL BEFORE YOU

04:33:28.024 --> 04:33:29.626
NOW TAKES A DIFFERENT APPROACH,

04:33:29.693 --> 04:33:32.696
REQUIRING EARLY ENGAGEMENT BY

04:33:32.763 --> 04:33:33.997
HIGH SPEED RAIL AND WITH THE

04:33:34.064 --> 04:33:36.266
PERMITTING AUTHORITIES REQUIRING

04:33:36.333 --> 04:33:38.769
HIGH SPEED RAIL TO ISSUE

04:33:38.835 --> 04:33:40.137
REGULATIONS WITH BINDING

04:33:40.203 --> 04:33:42.005
ARBITRATION. SO IF THERE IS A

04:33:42.072 --> 04:33:43.340
DISPUTE, THERE'S QUICK

04:33:43.406 --> 04:33:45.275
ARBITRATION AND A QUICK

04:33:45.342 --> 04:33:48.411
DECISION. AND SO, YOU KNOW, THIS

04:33:48.478 --> 04:33:50.480
BILL, WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK

04:33:50.547 --> 04:33:53.049
ON IT. AND WE'RE JUST HAD A

04:33:53.116 --> 04:33:54.684
MEETING WITH THE CHAIR OF THE

04:33:54.751 --> 04:33:56.486
UTILITIES AND ENERGY COMMITTEE

04:33:56.553 --> 04:33:57.387
THIS MORNING. WE'RE TRIPLE

04:33:57.454 --> 04:33:59.022
REFERRED. MR. CARRILLO WILL SEE

04:33:59.089 --> 04:34:00.524
IT LATER THIS WEEK AS WELL. IT'S

04:34:00.590 --> 04:34:02.592
ALL IN THE FAMILY THIS WEEK. AND

04:34:02.659 --> 04:34:04.961
I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS BILL

04:34:05.028 --> 04:34:07.564
BECAUSE IN CALIFORNIA WE NEED TO

04:34:07.631 --> 04:34:09.332
SHOW THAT WE CAN DELIVER

04:34:09.399 --> 04:34:11.101
PROJECTS AND DELIVER THEM IN A

04:34:11.168 --> 04:34:14.037
TIMELY WAY. AND THIS BILL IS ONE

04:34:14.104 --> 04:34:15.639
STEP IN THAT DIRECTION. AND I

04:34:15.705 --> 04:34:17.474
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

04:34:17.541 --> 04:34:19.910
WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IS MARK

04:34:19.976 --> 04:34:23.013
VUKOVICH FROM STREETS FOR ALL

04:34:23.079 --> 04:34:24.815
AND KEITH DUNN FROM THE STATE

04:34:24.881 --> 04:34:29.452
BUILDING TRADES. GOOD AFTERNOON,

04:34:29.519 --> 04:34:30.921
CHAIR AND MEMBERS. MARK PERKOVIC

04:34:30.987 --> 04:34:33.089
FROM STREETS FOR ALL. SB 445

04:34:33.156 --> 04:34:34.524
DIRECTLY ADDRESSES ONE OF THE

04:34:34.591 --> 04:34:35.892
MOST PERSISTENT AND COSTLY

04:34:35.959 --> 04:34:36.993
PROBLEMS AFFECTING PUBLIC

04:34:37.060 --> 04:34:37.928
INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA,

04:34:37.994 --> 04:34:39.963
WHICH IS THIRD PARTY PERMITTING

04:34:40.030 --> 04:34:41.832
DELAYS. TODAY, THE PROCESS FOR

04:34:41.898 --> 04:34:43.433
SECURING PERMITS AND APPROVALS

04:34:43.500 --> 04:34:44.501
FOR UTILITIES, LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

04:34:44.568 --> 04:34:46.002
AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES IS

04:34:46.069 --> 04:34:47.537
FRAGMENTED AND INCONSISTENT.

04:34:47.604 --> 04:34:49.606
THIRD PARTIES, SOME PUBLIC, SOME

04:34:49.673 --> 04:34:51.041
PRIVATE, ARE ESSENTIAL TO

04:34:51.107 --> 04:34:52.676
DELIVERY OF PROJECTS LIKE HIGH

04:34:52.742 --> 04:34:54.644
SPEED RAIL AND OTHER UTILITIES,

04:34:54.711 --> 04:34:56.012
YET THEY OFTENTIMES FACE NO

04:34:56.079 --> 04:34:57.647
STATUTORY DEADLINES OR MOST

04:34:57.714 --> 04:34:59.683
IMPORTANTLY, NO INCENTIVE TO ACT

04:34:59.749 --> 04:35:01.084
QUICKLY. THIS CAN MEAN

04:35:01.151 --> 04:35:02.686
OFTENTIMES MULTIYEAR DELAYS FOR

04:35:02.752 --> 04:35:03.787
SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS REVIEWING

04:35:03.854 --> 04:35:05.455
A RELOCATION PLAN OR SIGNING OFF

04:35:05.522 --> 04:35:07.657
ON A DESIGN. THIS ISN'T UNIQUE

04:35:07.724 --> 04:35:09.059
TO HIGH SPEED RAIL. IT'S

04:35:09.125 --> 04:35:10.393
ACTUALLY SYSTEMIC FOR

04:35:10.460 --> 04:35:11.094
MULTI-JURISDICTIONAL PROJECTS.

04:35:11.161 --> 04:35:12.929
SO LA METRO HAS FOUND THAT

04:35:12.996 --> 04:35:14.531
GETTING PERMITS AND CLEARANCES

04:35:14.598 --> 04:35:15.632
FROM OTHER AGENCIES OFTEN ADDS

04:35:15.699 --> 04:35:17.734
12 TO 18 MONTHS TO PROJECT

04:35:17.801 --> 04:35:19.135
TIMELINES, AND THESE ISSUES CAN

04:35:19.202 --> 04:35:21.004
STALL EVEN THE MOST MODEST

04:35:21.071 --> 04:35:21.638
PEDESTRIAN OR BIKE SAFETY

04:35:21.705 --> 04:35:23.540
UPGRADE. THESE DELAYS ARE

04:35:23.607 --> 04:35:24.574
EXPENSIVE AND DEEPLY

04:35:24.641 --> 04:35:25.675
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. EACH MONTH OF

04:35:25.742 --> 04:35:27.310
DELAYS ADDS LABOR AND MATERIALS

04:35:27.377 --> 04:35:29.646
COSTS, INFLATES PROJECT BUDGETS,

04:35:29.713 --> 04:35:31.114
DIMINISHES THE RETURN ON PUBLIC

04:35:31.181 --> 04:35:32.883
INVESTMENT, AND ULTIMATELY THEY

04:35:32.949 --> 04:35:34.251
DELAY THE BENEFITS THE TAXPAYER

04:35:34.317 --> 04:35:36.486
IS DEMANDING OF THE STATE. THIS

04:35:36.553 --> 04:35:37.954
BILL REQUIRES HIGH SPEED RAIL TO

04:35:38.021 --> 04:35:39.256
ADOPT CLEAR, ENFORCEABLE

04:35:39.322 --> 04:35:40.724
REGULATIONS DEVELOPED IN

REGULATIONS TO RELOCATE PUBLIC

04:39:16.172 --> 04:39:17.140

IMPACT THAT THE NEW AUTHORITY

04:39:21.744 --> 04:39:23.079
GRANTED TO THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

04:39:23.146 --> 04:39:24.314
AUTHORITY UNDER THIS BILL WOULD

04:39:27.450 --> 04:39:28.418
FIRSTLY, GIVING HIGH SPEED RAIL

AUTHORITY THIS NEW REGULATORY

04:39:30.186 --> 04:39:32.155
AUTHORITY, Ã, RAISES QUESTIONS

04:39:32.222 --> 04:39:33.356
ABOUT IF THERE WOULD BE A

04:39:33.423 --> 04:39:34.924
NEUTRAL ARBITER, GIVEN THAT

04:39:34.991 --> 04:39:36.459
OBVIOUSLY THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

04:39:36.526 --> 04:39:37.494
AUTHORITY WANTS THE PROJECT TO

04:39:37.560 --> 04:39:39.295
GET BUILT. WE THINK THAT THIS

04:39:39.362 --> 04:39:41.397
COULD LEAD TO SCENARIOS WHERE

04:39:41.464 --> 04:39:42.499
OUR CONCERNS ARE VALID, BUT

04:39:42.565 --> 04:39:44.033
OVERRULED DUE TO A DESIRE TO GET

OUTLINED IN SECTION H. WE HAVE

04:39:50.507 --> 04:39:51.841
SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THIS

04:39:51.908 --> 04:39:53.676
PROCESS AS THERE ARE LITTLE

04:39:53.743 --> 04:39:55.512
DETAILS ABOUT WHAT THIS PROCESS

04:39:55.578 --> 04:39:56.980
IS, WHO WILL ADMINISTER IT AND

04:39:57.046 --> 04:39:58.548
WHAT APPEALS PROCESS, IF ANY,

04:39:58.615 --> 04:40:00.550
WILL HAVE. ADDITIONALLY, WE'RE

04:40:00.617 --> 04:40:02.352
CONCERNED ABOUT THE HIGH SPEED

04:40:02.418 --> 04:40:03.586
RAIL AUTHORITY'S ABILITY TO

04:40:03.653 --> 04:40:04.621
REQUIRE PUBLIC UTILITIES TO MOVE

04:40:04.687 --> 04:40:06.189
OUR INFRASTRUCTURE, POTENTIALLY

04:40:06.256 --> 04:40:08.191
AT OUR CUSTOMER'S EXPENSE. THIS

04:40:08.258 --> 04:40:10.393
IS A BIG CONCERN, AND WE WANT TO

04:40:10.460 --> 04:40:11.794
ENSURE THAT OUR CUSTOMERS DO NOT

04:40:11.861 --> 04:40:13.830
BEAR THE DIRECT COST OF

RELOCATING THIS INFRASTRUCTURE

04:40:14.531 --> 04:40:15.365
THROUGH US HAVING TO RAISE THEIR

04:40:15.431 --> 04:40:17.066
UTILITY BILLS. SIMILARLY, WE'D

04:40:17.133 --> 04:40:18.801
LIKE TO ENSURE THAT NOTHING IN

04:40:18.868 --> 04:40:20.003
THE FORTHCOMING REGULATIONS

04:40:20.069 --> 04:40:21.905
IMPEDE THE ABILITY OF UTILITY TO

04:40:21.971 --> 04:40:23.973
RELIABLY DELIVER OUR UTILITY

04:40:24.040 --> 04:40:25.742
SERVICES. LASTLY, WE DO HAVE

04:40:25.808 --> 04:40:26.843
CONCERNS ABOUT THE RUSHED NATURE

04:40:26.910 --> 04:40:29.112
OF THIS BILL AND THE LACK OF

04:40:29.179 --> 04:40:29.679
STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND

04:40:29.746 --> 04:40:31.481
FEEDBACK. THIS BILL HAS BEEN AN

04:40:31.548 --> 04:40:32.916
INTENT BILL SINCE APRIL, AND WE

04:40:32.982 --> 04:40:35.084
HAVE NOT BEEN APPROACHED BY THE

CONCERNS OR GIVE FEEDBACK ON

04:40:39.122 --> 04:40:40.156
THIS PROPOSAL. THERE ARE

04:40:40.223 --> 04:40:41.558
NUMEROUS WATER, ELECTRIC AND

04:40:41.624 --> 04:40:43.026
WASTEWATER UTILITIES IN

04:40:43.092 --> 04:40:43.993
CALIFORNIA, AND IT'S EXTREMELY

04:40:44.060 --> 04:40:45.495
DIFFICULT FOR US TO RECEIVE

04:40:45.562 --> 04:40:47.797
FEEDBACK IN THE SHORT TIME

04:40:47.864 --> 04:40:51.000

PUSHED THROUGH NECESSARILY THIS

SOLELY WITHIN THE HANDS OF THE

IMPROVE RELATIONS AND TIMELINES

04:41:43.953 --> 04:41:45.688

THE INTERAGENCY TASK FORCE THAT

04:42:19.589 --> 04:42:21.057
FREQUENTLY ASKED TO RELOCATE FOR

04:42:21.124 --> 04:42:23.026
VARIOUS CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS.

04:42:23.092 --> 04:42:24.560
SOME OF THESE ARE VERY

04:42:24.627 --> 04:42:25.295
STRAIGHTFORWARD, BUT SOME ARE

04:42:25.361 --> 04:42:27.864
VERY COMPLEX AND NEED TIME FOR

04:42:27.930 --> 04:42:29.198
CAREFUL COORDINATION BETWEEN

TWICE IN THE LAST COUPLE OF

04:42:46.249 --> 04:42:47.550
DEEPLY ANALYZING THE MOST RECENT

04:42:47.617 --> 04:42:49.352
AMENDMENTS, WE BELIEVE ROBUST

04:42:49.419 --> 04:42:50.787

HANDS YET, I DO WANT TO ASK THE

04:44:52.241 --> 04:44:53.576
AUTHOR THIS. SO THE LEGISLATURE

04:44:53.643 --> 04:44:55.778
HAS BEEN EXTREMELY FOCUSED ON

04:44:55.845 --> 04:44:56.879
UTILITY, AFFORDABILITY AND JUST

04:44:56.946 --> 04:44:59.315
THE IMPACT ON CONSUMERS. AND I

04:44:59.382 --> 04:45:02.952
DON'T WANT US TO BE POTENTIALLY

04:45:03.019 --> 04:45:04.353
PUTTING NEW COSTS ON OUR

04:45:04.420 --> 04:45:05.888
RATEPAYERS OR CONSUMERS IN

GENERAL. AND SO WE'VE HAD AN

04:45:08.057 --> 04:45:09.225
OPPORTUNITY TO TALK QUITE A BIT

04:45:09.292 --> 04:45:11.093
ABOUT THIS BILL. BUT ONE THING

04:45:11.160 --> 04:45:12.328
THAT KEPT COMING UP IN MULTIPLE

04:45:12.395 --> 04:45:13.262
CONVERSATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS

04:45:13.329 --> 04:45:14.997
IS WE WERE NAVIGATING AROUND

04:45:15.064 --> 04:45:16.732
THIS. AND JUST FOR EVERYONE TO

04:45:16.799 --> 04:45:19.168
KNOW, MYSELF, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

04:45:19.235 --> 04:45:21.304
CARRILLO AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER

04:45:21.370 --> 04:45:22.605
PETRIE-NORRIS HAVE BEEN HAVING A

04:45:22.672 --> 04:45:23.773
LOT OF DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS

04:45:23.840 --> 04:45:25.341
BILL SINCE IT WAS TRIPLE

04:45:25.408 --> 04:45:27.443
REFERRED IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM

04:45:27.510 --> 04:45:30.713
HAS COME UP AROUND THE COST TO

04:45:30.780 --> 04:45:32.715
UTILITIES BECAUSE ELECTRIC, GAS

04:45:32.782 --> 04:45:34.617
AND TELECOM INFRASTRUCTURE IS

04:45:34.684 --> 04:45:36.853
CURRENTLY BEING BUILT ALONG

04:45:36.919 --> 04:45:39.655
EXISTING RAIL RIGHT OF WAY. AND

04:45:39.722 --> 04:45:41.390
SO THERE'S THIS ISSUE AROUND THE

04:45:41.457 --> 04:45:42.825
HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY'S

04:45:42.892 --> 04:45:44.694
RESPONSIBILITY TO REIMBURSE WHEN

04:45:44.760 --> 04:45:46.863
ITS NEEDS EXPAND INTO THE RIGHT

04:45:46.929 --> 04:45:48.998
OF WAY OR MOVE INFRASTRUCTURE.

04:45:49.065 --> 04:45:51.234
SO COULD YOU CLARIFY YOUR

04:45:51.300 --> 04:45:52.635
INTENT? BECAUSE WE'RE WORKING

04:45:52.702 --> 04:45:54.070
THROUGH LANGUAGE, AND I KNOW

04:45:54.136 --> 04:45:55.471
THERE'S LOTS OF AMENDMENTS THAT

04:45:55.538 --> 04:45:58.674
WOULD NOT ONLY BE TAKEN IN THIS

04:45:58.741 --> 04:45:59.175
COMMITTEE, BUT IN OTHER

04:45:59.242 --> 04:46:01.611
COMMITTEES AS IT RELATES TO THE

04:46:01.677 --> 04:46:03.212
COST FOR REMOVAL AND REPLACEMENT

04:46:03.279 --> 04:46:05.948
OF THIS TYPE OF INFRASTRUCTURE.

04:46:06.015 --> 04:46:09.151
YES, I'M HAPPY TO, TO DO THAT.

04:46:09.218 --> 04:46:12.388
SO FIRST OF ALL, WE THE BILL

04:46:12.455 --> 04:46:15.458
THAT'S IN PRINT HAS BEEN AMENDED

04:46:15.525 --> 04:46:18.594
SO THAT THE THAT AT LEAST FOR

04:46:18.661 --> 04:46:20.329
NOW, IT DOES NOT APPLY THE

04:46:20.396 --> 04:46:22.665
BINDING ARBITRATION TO INVESTOR

04:46:22.732 --> 04:46:25.368
OWNED UTILITIES. WE I'VE BEEN IN

04:46:25.434 --> 04:46:27.203
CONVERSATION WITH WITH THE CHAIR

04:46:27.270 --> 04:46:29.739
OF UTILITIES ENERGY AND WE'RE

04:46:29.805 --> 04:46:32.542
GOING TO INCLUDE PUBLICLY OWNED

04:46:32.608 --> 04:46:35.711
UTILITIES IN THAT SAME CATEGORY.

04:46:35.778 --> 04:46:38.347
IN ADDITION, WE ARE VERY OPEN TO

04:46:38.414 --> 04:46:41.217
COST RECOVERY. AND AS LONG AS

04:46:41.284 --> 04:46:44.954
THERE IS ACCOUNTABILITY AS WELL.

04:46:45.021 --> 04:46:47.089
AND YOU KNOW, I JUST WANT TO SAY

04:46:47.156 --> 04:46:48.291
IN TERMS OF THIS SUGGESTION, IT

04:46:48.357 --> 04:46:50.192
SHOULD BE A TWO YEAR BILL. AND

04:46:50.259 --> 04:46:51.961
WE'RE GOING TO WORK WITH, WITH

04:46:52.028 --> 04:46:53.396
WITH EVERYONE ON THIS, THIS

04:46:53.462 --> 04:46:55.231
BILL, AS I SAID AT THE

04:46:55.298 --> 04:46:57.733
BEGINNING, APPLIED TO ALL

04:46:57.800 --> 04:47:00.269
MULTI-JURISDICTIONAL PROJECTS.

04:47:00.336 --> 04:47:02.071
WE HAVE SLIMMED IT DOWN ONLY TO

04:47:02.138 --> 04:47:03.372
HIGH SPEED RAIL. WE'LL WORK ON

04:47:03.439 --> 04:47:05.975
THE OTHER ITEMS FOR THE FUTURE

04:47:06.042 --> 04:47:08.477
BECAUSE IT IS TIME SENSITIVE. IT

04:47:08.544 --> 04:47:10.212
IS TIME SENSITIVE AND WE HAVE TO

04:47:10.279 --> 04:47:13.282
GET THIS PROJECT GOING. AND SO

04:47:13.349 --> 04:47:15.885
WE HAVE, YOU KNOW, WE TRIED ONE

04:47:15.952 --> 04:47:17.186
APPROACH WITH THE 30 DAY SHOT

04:47:17.253 --> 04:47:20.823
CLOCK THAT GOT ENORMOUS

04:47:20.890 --> 04:47:22.925
RESISTANCE. WE THEN TOOK SOME

04:47:22.992 --> 04:47:25.461
TIME AND WE AND WE PUT THIS NEW

04:47:25.528 --> 04:47:26.963
APPROACH INTO THE BILL. WE'RE

04:47:27.029 --> 04:47:27.897
WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEES.

04:47:27.964 --> 04:47:29.799
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK

04:47:29.865 --> 04:47:33.102
INTENSIVELY OVER THE SUMMER TO

04:47:33.169 --> 04:47:35.237
TRY TO DELIVER SOMETHING THAT

04:47:35.304 --> 04:47:36.639
WILL GET THE PROJECT GOING AND

04:47:36.706 --> 04:47:38.474
TREAT EVERYONE FAIRLY. BUT WITH

04:47:38.541 --> 04:47:40.376
THAT SAID, WE CAN SEE THIS FROM

04:47:40.443 --> 04:47:43.079
THE AND I KNEW WHEN I INTRODUCED

04:47:43.145 --> 04:47:44.914
THIS BILL, IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE

04:47:44.981 --> 04:47:45.448
EVERY FORM OF OPPOSITION,

04:47:45.514 --> 04:47:47.250
BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO DO

04:47:47.316 --> 04:47:48.217
A PROJECT LIKE THIS, IT TOUCHES

04:47:48.284 --> 04:47:49.018
ON EVERYTHING CITIES, COUNTIES,

04:47:49.085 --> 04:47:50.620
WATER DISTRICTS, PUBLICLY OWNED

04:47:50.686 --> 04:47:52.188
UTILITIES, PRIVATELY OWNED

04:47:52.254 --> 04:47:54.724
UTILITIES, EVERYTHING. AND IT

04:47:54.790 --> 04:47:56.359
ENDS UP THAT THE PROJECT, AS YOU

04:47:56.425 --> 04:48:00.029
HEARD WITNESSES TALK ABOUT, JUST

04:48:00.096 --> 04:48:01.931
GETS BOGGED DOWN. SO HOW DO WE

04:48:01.998 --> 04:48:03.199
GET THAT GOING, GET IT GOING

04:48:03.265 --> 04:48:05.534
MORE QUICKLY AND TREAT EVERYONE

04:48:05.601 --> 04:48:07.103
FAIRLY, WHICH WE WANT TO DO, AND

04:48:07.169 --> 04:48:08.304
WE'RE COMMITTED TO THAT. THANK

04:48:08.371 --> 04:48:09.939
YOU. AND I DID MAKE AN ERROR IN

04:48:10.006 --> 04:48:11.440
MY COMMENTS ABOUT AMENDMENTS

04:48:11.507 --> 04:48:12.608
THERE NOT BEING TAKEN AMENDMENTS

04:48:12.675 --> 04:48:14.143
TODAY. TODAY IS A Dð PAST. WE'VE

04:48:14.210 --> 04:48:15.211
BEEN TALKING ABOUT AMENDMENTS

04:48:15.277 --> 04:48:16.278
WITHOUT TIME GIVEN THE FACT THAT

04:48:16.345 --> 04:48:18.381
IT WAS TRIPLE REFERRED. SO I

04:48:18.447 --> 04:48:20.016
JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE TO THE

04:48:20.082 --> 04:48:22.118
COMMITTEE, IF THEY IF YOU WERE

04:48:22.184 --> 04:48:23.452
LOOKING FOR SOME AMENDMENTS THAT

04:48:23.519 --> 04:48:24.120
WERE NOT AMENDMENTS TAKEN IN OUR

04:48:24.186 --> 04:48:25.121
COMMITTEE TODAY. YEAH. AND WE

04:48:25.187 --> 04:48:27.657
WILL BE TAKING MINUTES. I KNOW

04:48:27.723 --> 04:48:28.524
IN UTILITIES AND ENERGY WITH THE

04:48:28.591 --> 04:48:29.592
COMMITMENT THAT WE'RE ALL GOING

04:48:29.659 --> 04:48:31.427
TO THEN, FOR EXAMPLE, WITH THE

04:48:31.494 --> 04:48:34.196
IOUS AND THE PWS, WE'RE TAKING

04:48:34.263 --> 04:48:35.898
THE BINDING ARBITRATION OUT. BUT

04:48:35.965 --> 04:48:38.300
WE DO WANT TO PUT THERE NEEDS TO

04:48:38.367 --> 04:48:40.369
BE SOMETHING IN THE BILL WITH

04:48:40.436 --> 04:48:41.070
ACCOUNTABILITY, BECAUSE RIGHT

04:48:41.137 --> 04:48:42.738
NOW IT'S JUST LIKE PRETTY

04:48:42.805 --> 04:48:44.774
PLEASE. AND THERE ARE ACTORS WHO

04:48:44.840 --> 04:48:46.575
ARE VERY RESPONSIVE AND SOME WHO

04:48:46.642 --> 04:48:48.344
ARE NOT. AND WE WANT TO MAKE

04:48:48.411 --> 04:48:50.446
SURE THAT THERE IS

04:48:50.513 --> 04:48:52.682
ACCOUNTABILITY. THE BINDING

04:48:52.748 --> 04:48:54.116
ARBITRATION IS OUR APPROACH TO

04:48:54.183 --> 04:48:55.584
THAT. WE THINK IT'S A FAIR

04:48:55.651 --> 04:48:56.485
APPROACH. WE UNDERSTAND THERE

04:48:56.552 --> 04:48:58.721
ARE CONCERNS WITH THE WITH THE

04:48:58.788 --> 04:48:59.922
ELECTRIC UTILITIES. AND SO WE'RE

04:48:59.989 --> 04:49:01.924
GOING TO KEEP WORKING THAT OUT.

04:49:01.991 --> 04:49:03.592
IT'S STILL WET SO FAR AS MEMBERS

04:49:03.659 --> 04:49:05.227
MAKE THEIR COMMENTS. THAT'D BE

04:49:05.294 --> 04:49:06.195
APPROPRIATE TIME TO TALK ABOUT

04:49:06.262 --> 04:49:08.064
THE THINGS THAT YOU WOULD WANT

04:49:08.130 --> 04:49:09.932
TO SEE. AS WE'RE STILL WORKING

04:49:09.999 --> 04:49:11.067
THROUGH LANGUAGE, I HAVE THREE

04:49:11.133 --> 04:49:12.868
MEMBERS IN C¯, PAPIN, AGUILAR,

04:49:12.935 --> 04:49:14.970
CURRY, THEN CARRILLO. AND SO IF

04:49:15.037 --> 04:49:17.139
OTHERS WANT TO ADD, WELL, THANK

04:49:17.206 --> 04:49:19.875
YOU, SENATOR, FOR GIVING ME YOUR

04:49:19.942 --> 04:49:22.878
BEST SHOT. WE'RE TRYING, I'M

04:49:22.945 --> 04:49:25.181
TRYING. SO AS I MENTIONED TO YOU

04:49:25.247 --> 04:49:27.183
EARLIER TODAY, I HEAR YOU ON THE

04:49:27.249 --> 04:49:28.851
RIGHT OF WAY ISSUES. CALTRAIN IN

04:49:28.918 --> 04:49:30.086
MY DISTRICT HAD SOME GREAT

04:49:30.152 --> 04:49:31.887
STEPS, AND AT THE END WE ENDED

04:49:31.954 --> 04:49:34.123
UP 20 MILLION IN THE HOLE,

04:49:34.190 --> 04:49:36.559
LARGELY BECAUSE OF DELAYS DUE TO

04:49:36.625 --> 04:49:38.828
WHAT UTILITY RIGHT OF WAYS. IT

04:49:38.894 --> 04:49:40.362
WAS NO PICNIC AND WE WENT AROUND

04:49:40.429 --> 04:49:42.264
AT THE LAST MINUTE, BEGGED FOR

04:49:42.331 --> 04:49:43.799
THE MONEY, AND WE MADE IT

04:49:43.866 --> 04:49:45.267
THROUGH. BUT IT WAS IT WAS NOT A

04:49:45.334 --> 04:49:47.036
FUN EXERCISE OR FIRE DRILL, IF

04:49:47.103 --> 04:49:49.405
YOU WILL. SO AS I MENTIONED, THE

04:49:49.472 --> 04:49:50.072
THING ABOUT THE BILL THAT KIND

04:49:50.139 --> 04:49:51.907
OF CONCERNS ME A LITTLE IS

04:49:51.974 --> 04:49:54.143
HAVING HIGH SPEED RAIL COME UP

04:49:54.210 --> 04:49:54.877
WITH REGULATIONS. THAT'S A

04:49:54.944 --> 04:49:55.978
LITTLE BIT OF THE FOX WITH THE

04:49:56.045 --> 04:49:58.314
CHICKENS FOR ME. SO I'M GOING TO

04:49:58.380 --> 04:49:59.915
VOTE FOR IT TODAY. BUT I WOULD

04:49:59.982 --> 04:50:01.417
LIKE TO SEE A CHANGE TO THAT, I

04:50:01.484 --> 04:50:04.220
THINK PERHAPS AS THE

04:50:04.286 --> 04:50:06.422
ILLUSTRATIVE STAFF REPORT

04:50:06.489 --> 04:50:07.857
POINTED OUT, PERHAPS IT COULD BE

04:50:07.923 --> 04:50:09.959
STATE CREATED REGULATIONS, WHICH

04:50:10.025 --> 04:50:11.527
MIGHT THEN GIVE YOU THE

04:50:11.594 --> 04:50:12.328
ENFORCEMENT PIECE THAT YOU'RE

04:50:12.394 --> 04:50:13.996
LOOKING FOR RATHER THAN

04:50:14.063 --> 04:50:15.164
ARBITRATION AND WHAT HAVE YOU.

04:50:15.231 --> 04:50:17.233
AND THEN I'D ALSO LIKE TO SEE

04:50:17.299 --> 04:50:18.434
SOME CLARITY ON WHO IT'S REALLY

04:50:18.501 --> 04:50:20.069
GOING. THE REGS ARE REALLY GOING

04:50:20.136 --> 04:50:21.137
TO APPLY TO THOSE THAT ARE TRULY

04:50:21.203 --> 04:50:23.906
IN CONTROL OF THE RIGHT OF WAY.

04:50:23.973 --> 04:50:25.107
WE'VE GOT TO NARROWLY TAILOR IT.

04:50:25.174 --> 04:50:26.442
BUT THAT'S WHERE I AM TODAY, AND

04:50:26.509 --> 04:50:28.077
I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING IT ON

04:50:28.144 --> 04:50:29.512
BECAUSE I KNOW THIS PAIN

04:50:29.578 --> 04:50:30.713
HAPPENS. AND YOU'RE RIGHT, NO

04:50:30.780 --> 04:50:32.181
MATTER HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT HIGH

04:50:32.248 --> 04:50:34.183
SPEED RAIL, THIS IS AN

04:50:34.250 --> 04:50:35.584
IMPEDIMENT. AND IF YOU WANT IT

04:50:35.651 --> 04:50:37.219
TO BE, IF IT STANDS A CHANCE OF

04:50:37.286 --> 04:50:39.221
BEING SUCCESSFUL, THIS IS

04:50:39.288 --> 04:50:40.222
CERTAINLY. WHAT DID YOU CALL IT

04:50:40.289 --> 04:50:42.024
A SOMETHING POINT A CHOKE POINT.

04:50:42.091 --> 04:50:43.659
CHOKE POINT. YEAH. SO I HEAR

04:50:43.726 --> 04:50:44.360
YOU. THANKS VERY MUCH FOR

04:50:44.426 --> 04:50:48.164
HEARING ME OUT, AGUIAR-CURRY.

04:50:48.230 --> 04:50:51.367
GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR. THIS IS

04:50:51.433 --> 04:50:53.269
AN EXTREME WORK IN PROGRESS FOR

04:50:53.335 --> 04:50:55.004
ME. IT'S HARD TO TAKE THIS

04:50:55.070 --> 04:50:57.573
BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S. I LOVE

04:50:57.640 --> 04:50:59.375
HIGH SPEED RAIL. I HAVE FROM DAY

04:50:59.441 --> 04:51:01.877
ONE. I WILL TELL I NEVER VOTED

04:51:01.944 --> 04:51:04.446
ON IT YEARS AGO. HOWEVER, THE

04:51:04.513 --> 04:51:06.415
VOTERS SAID THEY WANTED HIGH

04:51:06.482 --> 04:51:07.183
SPEED RAIL AND I HAVE BACKED

04:51:07.249 --> 04:51:10.119
THEM ALL ALONG. WHAT'S

04:51:10.186 --> 04:51:11.353
FRUSTRATING TO ME IS THAT YEARS

04:51:11.420 --> 04:51:13.789
AND YEARS THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON

04:51:13.856 --> 04:51:15.291
AND WE KNEW WHAT THE WELL WE

04:51:15.357 --> 04:51:16.458
THOUGHT. WE KNEW WHAT THE ROUTE

04:51:16.525 --> 04:51:18.894
WAS, RIGHT. WE THOUGHT WE KNEW

04:51:18.961 --> 04:51:19.528
WHERE THIS HIGH SPEED RAIL WAS

04:51:19.595 --> 04:51:21.230
GOING TO GO. AND THEN WHETHER IT

04:51:21.297 --> 04:51:23.032
WAS FARMERS OR ENVIRONMENTAL,

04:51:23.098 --> 04:51:23.799
THIS THING HAS CHANGED. IT'S

04:51:23.866 --> 04:51:25.501
BEEN A MOVING TARGET. AND SO I'M

04:51:25.568 --> 04:51:27.369
I'M FRUSTRATED THAT LIKE, I FEEL

04:51:27.436 --> 04:51:29.104
LIKE WHY WEREN'T SOME OF THESE

04:51:29.171 --> 04:51:31.040
CONVERSATIONS DONE YEARS AGO

04:51:31.106 --> 04:51:32.975
ABOUT LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND WHERE

04:51:33.042 --> 04:51:34.777
THE ROUTES GOING TO GO, BECAUSE

04:51:34.844 --> 04:51:36.212
IT IS GOING TO COST SOMEBODY

04:51:36.278 --> 04:51:39.281
SOME MONEY. AND I'D LIKE TO SEE

04:51:39.348 --> 04:51:41.083
THIS HONED IN A LOT MORE,

04:51:41.150 --> 04:51:42.918
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S REALLY

04:51:42.985 --> 04:51:44.787
FRUSTRATING WHEN I LOOK AT HOW

04:51:44.854 --> 04:51:46.856
MUCH TIME AND EFFORT IT'S BEEN

04:51:46.922 --> 04:51:48.724
ON THIS FOR ALL THESE YEARS, AND

04:51:48.791 --> 04:51:50.059
WE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THIS.

04:51:50.125 --> 04:51:51.727
SOMEONE SHOULD HAVE HAD A VISION

04:51:51.794 --> 04:51:52.995
OF, THIS IS WHERE THESE ROUTES

04:51:53.062 --> 04:51:55.231
ARE GOING TO GO, AND THIS IS HOW

04:51:55.297 --> 04:51:57.032
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK WITH

04:51:57.099 --> 04:51:58.200
AND PUBLIC OUTREACH WITH EACH

04:51:58.267 --> 04:51:59.935
ONE OF THOSE CITIES THAT THEY'RE

04:52:00.002 --> 04:52:00.536
GOING THROUGH. AND NOW WE'VE

04:52:00.603 --> 04:52:02.304
KIND OF GOT THIS MESS ON OUR

04:52:02.371 --> 04:52:03.439
HANDS THAT EVERYONE'S COMING OUT

04:52:03.505 --> 04:52:05.174
OF THE WOODWORK ON. THAT SHOULD

04:52:05.241 --> 04:52:07.209
HAVE BEEN TAKEN CARE OF. I'M THE

04:52:07.276 --> 04:52:08.344
FIRST ONE TO SAY, I WANT THIS

04:52:08.410 --> 04:52:10.913
PROJECT TO GET MOVING ALONG, BUT

04:52:10.980 --> 04:52:12.481
I THINK WE NEED A LITTLE TIME ON

04:52:12.548 --> 04:52:13.649
THIS BECAUSE I REALLY FEEL LIKE

04:52:13.716 --> 04:52:15.985
IT'S A BIG WORK IN PROGRESS. YOU

04:52:16.051 --> 04:52:18.787
HAVE A LOT HERE IN A COUPLE OF

04:52:18.854 --> 04:52:20.689
DAYS AND I WANT IT TO BE

04:52:20.756 --> 04:52:22.124
SUCCESSFUL. I REALLY WANT IT TO

04:52:22.191 --> 04:52:23.926
BE SUCCESSFUL. I WANT US TO ALL

04:52:23.993 --> 04:52:26.161
SIT BACK AND SAY ALL WE DID, WE

04:52:26.228 --> 04:52:26.996
DID EVERYTHING WE CAN AND THE

04:52:27.062 --> 04:52:29.398
OUTREACH WAS DONE TO THESE

04:52:29.465 --> 04:52:31.100
CITIES. I DON'T WANT IT TO BE A,

04:52:31.166 --> 04:52:32.101
YOU KNOW, A YEAR PROCESS OR EVEN

04:52:32.167 --> 04:52:34.136
SIX MONTHS. I WANT IT TO MOVE

04:52:34.203 --> 04:52:35.804
ALONG. BUT I'M REALLY CONCERNED

04:52:35.871 --> 04:52:37.072
IS THAT MANY PEOPLE HAD VISIONS

04:52:37.139 --> 04:52:38.107
OF WHERE THIS WAS ALL SUPPOSED

04:52:38.173 --> 04:52:40.175
TO GO, AND NOW WE'RE COMING BACK

04:52:40.242 --> 04:52:41.343
AND THE CITIES ARE UPSET AND THE

04:52:41.410 --> 04:52:43.545
COUNTIES ARE UPSET AND THE

04:52:43.612 --> 04:52:44.213
SPECIAL DISTRICTS ARE UPSET. AND

04:52:44.280 --> 04:52:46.715
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THAT WE

04:52:46.782 --> 04:52:48.050
DIDN'T GET THAT CLARIFIED

04:52:48.117 --> 04:52:49.919
BEFORE. SO THIS IS NOTHING ON

04:52:49.985 --> 04:52:51.220
YOU. I THINK THAT WE'VE HAD

04:52:51.287 --> 04:52:52.321
MANAGEMENT CHANGES. WE'VE HAD

04:52:52.388 --> 04:52:54.356
LOTS OF THINGS GO ON. BUT THE

04:52:54.423 --> 04:52:57.426
FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT ROUTE

04:52:57.493 --> 04:53:00.029
HAS CHANGED A LOT FROM THE DAYS

04:53:00.095 --> 04:53:01.964
THAT I WORKED FOR A CONSULTING

04:53:02.031 --> 04:53:03.866
FIRM IN THE YEARS DOING

04:53:03.933 --> 04:53:05.668
ENVIRONMENTAL WORK, AND I SAW

04:53:05.734 --> 04:53:07.503
THIS COMING YEARS AGO, AND THE

04:53:07.569 --> 04:53:08.637
PUBLIC OUTREACH JUST WASN'T

04:53:08.704 --> 04:53:09.972
DONE. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN

04:53:10.039 --> 04:53:11.407
ANYWAY. THAT'S MY ONLY

04:53:11.473 --> 04:53:13.909
STATEMENT. I WILL BE LAYING OFF

04:53:13.976 --> 04:53:16.145
TODAY, BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU, I

04:53:16.211 --> 04:53:17.579
WANT HIGH SPEED RAIL TO BE

04:53:17.646 --> 04:53:19.448
COMPLETED AND I THINK WE CAN GET

04:53:19.515 --> 04:53:20.349
THERE. AND I'M HOPING BY THE

04:53:20.416 --> 04:53:22.217
TIME IT GETS TO THE FLOOR AND I

04:53:22.284 --> 04:53:24.520
VOTE FOR YOU, WE'LL WORK VERY

04:53:24.586 --> 04:53:27.523
HARD TO TRY TO HOPEFULLY GET YOU

04:53:27.589 --> 04:53:30.859
ON BOARD. THANK YOU. MOTION BY

04:53:30.926 --> 04:53:33.162
HAIRABEDIAN. IS THERE A SECOND?

04:53:33.228 --> 04:53:35.731
SECOND BY CARRILLO. MOVING ON TO

04:53:35.798 --> 04:53:37.032
CARRILLO, FOLLOWED BY ROGERS.

04:53:37.099 --> 04:53:39.101
THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR. I WANT

04:53:39.168 --> 04:53:39.868
TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR

04:53:39.935 --> 04:53:41.704
BRINGING THIS MEASURE FORWARD. I

04:53:41.770 --> 04:53:43.238
DO BELIEVE THAT WE CANNOT AFFORD

04:53:43.305 --> 04:53:45.975
TO MAKE THIS A TWO YEAR BILL. I

04:53:46.041 --> 04:53:47.209
THINK THAT WE HAVE TO MOVE

04:53:47.276 --> 04:53:48.210
FORWARD BECAUSE OF THE

04:53:48.277 --> 04:53:48.877
IMPORTANCE OF HAVING THIS

04:53:48.944 --> 04:53:53.282
PROJECT MOVING FORWARD. AND WHAT

04:53:53.349 --> 04:53:56.452
THE WITNESS IN SUPPORT MENTIONED

04:53:56.518 --> 04:54:00.089
ABOUT BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE THE

04:54:00.155 --> 04:54:01.790
TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY

04:54:01.857 --> 04:54:03.625
FOR THE CRITICISM THAT HAS BEEN

04:54:03.692 --> 04:54:05.828
GOING ON FOR YEARS NOW. AND I

04:54:05.894 --> 04:54:07.029
BELIEVE THAT THAT'S HAPPENING

04:54:07.096 --> 04:54:08.597
NOT ONLY WITH WHAT WE'RE

04:54:08.664 --> 04:54:10.833
DISCUSSING HERE RIGHT NOW, BUT

04:54:10.899 --> 04:54:11.567
ALSO THROUGH LEGISLATION JUST

04:54:11.633 --> 04:54:14.403
TODAY. AB 377 BY ASSEMBLYMEMBERS

04:54:14.470 --> 04:54:16.238
WAS APPROVED ON THE FLOOR WHERE

04:54:16.305 --> 04:54:19.308
THERE IS A BUSINESS PLAN HAS TO

04:54:19.375 --> 04:54:22.011
BE PROVIDED FROM MERCED TO

04:54:22.077 --> 04:54:24.213
BAKERSFIELD FOR THAT SEGMENT. SO

04:54:24.279 --> 04:54:25.447
I DO BELIEVE THAT WE'RE MOVING

04:54:25.514 --> 04:54:26.982
IN THAT DIRECTION. ON WHAT THE

04:54:27.049 --> 04:54:28.117
CRITICISM HAS BEEN, AGAIN,

04:54:28.183 --> 04:54:31.086
THROUGH LEGISLATION AS WELL. AND

04:54:31.153 --> 04:54:32.488
I JUST DON'T THINK THAT WE CAN

04:54:32.554 --> 04:54:34.490
AFFORD TO MAKE IT A TWO YEAR

04:54:34.556 --> 04:54:36.091
BILL. THAT'S JUST MY ADVICE TO

04:54:36.158 --> 04:54:38.293
YOU. PLEASE, LET'S MOVE IT. MOVE

04:54:38.360 --> 04:54:39.561
IT FORWARD. THE OTHER THING I

04:54:39.628 --> 04:54:42.164
WANTED TO CLARIFY, AND THANK YOU

04:54:42.231 --> 04:54:43.632
FOR WORKING WITH ALL OF US ON

04:54:43.699 --> 04:54:45.234
WHEN YOU SUBMITTED THIS MEASURE,

04:54:45.300 --> 04:54:46.869
AS YOU MENTIONED A COUPLE OF

04:54:46.935 --> 04:54:49.238
TIMES ALREADY, IT WAS VERY BROAD

04:54:49.304 --> 04:54:50.105
TO ALL PUBLIC TRANSIT PROJECTS

04:54:50.172 --> 04:54:51.507
AND WORKING THROUGH THE

04:54:51.573 --> 04:54:52.241
CONVERSATIONS AND WORKING WITH

04:54:52.307 --> 04:54:55.177
YOUR OFFICE AND OTHERS, I JUST

04:54:55.244 --> 04:54:57.312
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

04:54:57.379 --> 04:54:58.347
CONVERSATIONS WE HAD ARE GOING

04:54:58.414 --> 04:55:00.582
TO BE APPLICABLE TO THE ENTIRE

04:55:00.649 --> 04:55:03.118
SEGMENT FROM LA TO SAN

04:55:03.185 --> 04:55:07.322
FRANCISCO, AND ON THE. DOCUMENT,

04:55:07.389 --> 04:55:09.858
THE LEGISLATION ON PAGE 24,

04:55:09.925 --> 04:55:13.495
CHAPTER SIX, LINE 20, SUBSECTION

04:55:13.562 --> 04:55:16.498
C, IF IT CAN BE VERY PRECISE, IT

04:55:16.565 --> 04:55:18.233
REFERENCES THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

04:55:18.300 --> 04:55:19.368
PROJECT MEANS THE PORTION OF THE

04:55:19.435 --> 04:55:21.236
HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT

04:55:21.303 --> 04:55:22.438
IDENTIFIED IN PARAGRAPH TWO OF

04:55:22.504 --> 04:55:25.007
SUBDIVISION B OF SECTION TWO,

04:55:25.074 --> 04:55:26.508
SEVEN ZERO, 4.04, AND AGAIN,

04:55:26.575 --> 04:55:27.876
JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT IS THE

04:55:27.943 --> 04:55:29.278
ENTIRE SYSTEM, TO MAKE SURE THAT

04:55:29.344 --> 04:55:31.713
ANY FUTURE PLANNED HIGH-SPEED

04:55:31.780 --> 04:55:34.083
RAIL STATIONS ARE ALSO GOING TO

04:55:34.149 --> 04:55:35.918
BE BENEFITING FROM GETTING THIS

04:55:35.984 --> 04:55:36.952
GOING THROUGH. SO WE CAN

04:55:37.019 --> 04:55:38.187
ACTUALLY DELIVER FOR

04:55:38.253 --> 04:55:39.822
CALIFORNIANS. ALSO, WANT TO JUST

04:55:39.888 --> 04:55:41.623
MAKE A COMMENT THAT I REALLY

04:55:41.690 --> 04:55:44.460
WANT TO SEE IN THE NEAR FUTURE

04:55:44.526 --> 04:55:45.661
CONVERSATIONS AS TO HOW OTHER

04:55:45.727 --> 04:55:47.629
HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEMS COULD

04:55:47.696 --> 04:55:49.498
COULD BE TIED TOGETHER TO HIGH

04:55:49.565 --> 04:55:50.999
SPEED RAIL, FOR INSTANCE,

04:55:51.066 --> 04:55:52.134
BRIGHTLINE. I THINK I MENTIONED

04:55:52.201 --> 04:55:54.503
THAT A COUPLE OF TIMES IN THIS

04:55:54.570 --> 04:55:55.571
COMMITTEE HOW BRIGHTLINE MAY BE

04:55:55.637 --> 04:55:56.772
THE ACTUAL PRIVATE SYSTEM THAT

04:55:56.839 --> 04:55:58.240
WE WILL HAVE IN CALIFORNIA FOR

04:55:58.307 --> 04:55:59.374
HIGH SPEED RAIL, GOING FROM

04:55:59.441 --> 04:56:01.210
RANCHO CUCAMONGA TO VEGAS. WE'VE

04:56:01.276 --> 04:56:02.811
BEEN TALKING ABOUT MAKING THAT

04:56:02.878 --> 04:56:04.446
CONNECTION BETWEEN THE PALMDALE

04:56:04.513 --> 04:56:06.415
HIGH SPEED RAIL STATION TO THE

04:56:06.482 --> 04:56:08.016
ONE IN APPLE VALLEY FOR

04:56:08.083 --> 04:56:09.351
BRIGHTLINE ON THE HIGH DESERT

04:56:09.418 --> 04:56:10.319
CORRIDOR, WHERE, IN FACT,

04:56:10.385 --> 04:56:12.187
THERE'S BEEN STUDIES THAT SHOW

04:56:12.254 --> 04:56:13.956
THAT RIDERSHIP WILL INCREASE BY

04:56:14.022 --> 04:56:16.925
40%. IF THAT LINE WERE TO BE

04:56:16.992 --> 04:56:19.428
PART OF THAT ROUTE TO VEGAS. SO

04:56:19.495 --> 04:56:20.496
AGAIN, JUST A COMMENT. I KNOW

04:56:20.562 --> 04:56:22.664
THAT THIS THE HIGH DESERT

04:56:22.731 --> 04:56:24.032
CORRIDOR IS NOT PART OF THIS

04:56:24.099 --> 04:56:25.234
CONVERSATION WE'RE HAVING NOW,

04:56:25.300 --> 04:56:26.401
BUT IN THE NEAR FUTURE, LOOK

04:56:26.468 --> 04:56:27.536
FORWARD TO HAVING THOSE

04:56:27.603 --> 04:56:29.138
CONVERSATIONS SO THAT WE CAN

04:56:29.204 --> 04:56:30.906
ACTUALLY, IF NOT CALIFORNIA HIGH

04:56:30.973 --> 04:56:31.573
SPEED RAIL. BUT BRIGHTLINE WOULD

04:56:31.640 --> 04:56:33.876
BE THE ONE THAT WOULD GIVE US AN

04:56:33.942 --> 04:56:34.543
OPPORTUNITY IN CALIFORNIA FOR US

04:56:34.610 --> 04:56:36.011
TO EXPERIENCE WHAT HIGH SPEED

04:56:36.078 --> 04:56:38.080
RAIL IS LIKE, AND THAT THOSE ARE

04:56:38.147 --> 04:56:39.581
MY COMMENTS. THANK YOU, MADAM

04:56:39.648 --> 04:56:42.885
CHAIR. THANK YOU. ROGERS. THANK

04:56:42.951 --> 04:56:44.720
YOU, CHAIR. AND SENATOR, I FIRST

04:56:44.786 --> 04:56:46.188
WANT TO START OFF BY. THANK YOU

04:56:46.255 --> 04:56:47.789
FOR THE CONVERSATION EARLIER

04:56:47.856 --> 04:56:49.224
ABOUT THE BILL. I THINK WHAT YOU

04:56:49.291 --> 04:56:51.293
SAID ABOUT DEATH BY A THOUSAND

04:56:51.360 --> 04:56:52.261
CUTS ON THESE PROJECTS IS TRUE.

04:56:52.327 --> 04:56:54.296
BUT I ALSO THINK THAT IT'S TRUE

04:56:54.363 --> 04:56:55.164
WHAT YOU HEAR FROM COMMUNITIES

04:56:55.230 --> 04:56:56.532
THAT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT RUNNING

04:56:56.598 --> 04:56:57.733
ROUGHSHOD OVER LOCAL WORK THAT'S

04:56:57.799 --> 04:56:59.301
BEEN DONE. AND HAVING DONE A

04:56:59.368 --> 04:57:00.869
GENERAL PLAN AND A DOWNTOWN

04:57:00.936 --> 04:57:02.271
SPECIFIC PLAN AND AN ENHANCED

04:57:02.337 --> 04:57:03.238
INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING

04:57:03.305 --> 04:57:05.841
DISTRICT ON THE SAME AREA IN MY

04:57:05.908 --> 04:57:07.409
COMMUNITY, I UNDERSTAND HOW HARD

04:57:07.476 --> 04:57:10.145
IT IS TO KIND OF THREAD THAT

04:57:10.212 --> 04:57:11.513
NEEDLE AND HOW DIFFICULT IT IS

04:57:11.580 --> 04:57:13.048
FOR FOLKS TO KIND OF GIVE UP

04:57:13.115 --> 04:57:14.349
SOME OF THAT LOCAL CONTROL OR,

04:57:14.416 --> 04:57:16.251
OR TO CEDE THAT TO AN AGENCY

04:57:16.318 --> 04:57:18.153
THAT THEY HAVE NO OVERSIGHT OF.

04:57:18.220 --> 04:57:19.588
AS I SAID EARLIER, I'M GOING TO

04:57:19.655 --> 04:57:20.889
GIVE YOU THE GRACE AND VOTE FOR

04:57:20.956 --> 04:57:23.091
THE BILL TODAY. I DO GET TO SEE

04:57:23.158 --> 04:57:25.160
IT IN TWO DAYS AND UTILITIES AND

04:57:25.227 --> 04:57:26.195
ENERGY, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO

04:57:26.261 --> 04:57:28.397
WHAT THE BILL WILL LOOK LIKE AT

04:57:28.463 --> 04:57:30.365
THAT POINT. I KNOW THAT THOSE

04:57:30.432 --> 04:57:30.999
DISCUSSIONS ARE ONGOING, BUT I

04:57:31.066 --> 04:57:33.802
HOPE YOU WILL TAKE SOME OF THE

04:57:33.869 --> 04:57:34.303
FEEDBACK FROM OUR LOCAL

04:57:34.369 --> 04:57:36.004
ORGANIZATIONS SERIOUSLY AND TRY

04:57:36.071 --> 04:57:38.407

ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS, WHILE

04:57:42.377 --> 04:57:43.946
ALSO REMOVING SOME OF THE

04:57:44.012 --> 04:57:46.048
BARRIERS TO GETTING THIS PROJECT

04:57:46.114 --> 04:57:48.417

THANK YOU. IT SEEMS LIKE YOU

IT'S YOUR SPECIALTY AND WE

04:57:58.727 --> 04:58:00.495
DEFINITELY APPRECIATE IT.

04:58:00.562 --> 04:58:03.398
DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND THE NEED

04:58:03.465 --> 04:58:05.534
TO OVERCOME THE CONTINUOUS

04:58:05.601 --> 04:58:08.503
CHOKEHOLDS. AND I DO APPRECIATE,

04:58:08.570 --> 04:58:10.072
YOU KNOW, THAT YOU'VE BEEN VERY

04:58:10.138 --> 04:58:11.807
WORKABLE WITH THE FOLKS AND

04:58:11.873 --> 04:58:13.375
TRYING TO MAKE THE AMENDMENTS.

04:58:13.442 --> 04:58:14.610
WITH THAT SAID, AS I'VE BEEN

04:58:14.676 --> 04:58:15.477
LOOKING THROUGH IT AND SPEAKING

04:58:15.544 --> 04:58:17.346
WITH MY STAFF, I'VE BEEN KIND OF

04:58:17.412 --> 04:58:19.948
LIKE GOING BACK AND FORTH. IT'S

04:58:20.015 --> 04:58:21.149
MY UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU ARE

04:58:21.216 --> 04:58:22.451
CONTINUING TO TAKE AMENDMENTS

04:58:22.517 --> 04:58:25.721
AFTER TODAY, AND AS MUCH AS I DO

04:58:25.787 --> 04:58:27.789
SUPPORT THE BILL, I WOULD LIKE

04:58:27.856 --> 04:58:28.957

04:58:29.024 --> 04:58:29.992
GOVERNMENT, I COMPLETELY

04:58:30.058 --> 04:58:31.526
UNDERSTAND WHAT SOME OF THE

04:58:31.593 --> 04:58:33.662
LOCAL GOVERNMENT CONCERNS ARE,

04:58:33.729 --> 04:58:35.197
AND I FEEL LIKE YOU ARE WORKING

04:58:35.264 --> 04:58:37.165
REALLY HARD TO GET THERE, AND I

04:58:37.232 --> 04:58:39.768
JUST WANT TO KIND OF GIVE YOU

HOPING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT

04:58:45.240 --> 04:58:47.276
THIS WHEN IT COMES TO THE FLOOR.

04:58:47.342 --> 04:58:49.678
THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU.

04:58:49.745 --> 04:58:52.481
ALL RIGHT. SEEING NO OTHER

04:58:52.547 --> 04:58:53.815
COMMENTS, QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS

04:58:53.882 --> 04:58:55.083
FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE,

04:58:55.150 --> 04:58:57.552
THE I THINK IT'S BEEN MOVED.

04:58:57.619 --> 04:59:00.289
YES. HAIRABEDIAN AND CARRILLO,

04:59:00.355 --> 04:59:02.124
THERE'S A THIRD OR AN A MAN AS

04:59:02.190 --> 04:59:05.093
HE SAID. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR

04:59:05.160 --> 04:59:06.728
BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND

04:59:06.795 --> 04:59:09.665
PROUD TO BE A COAUTHOR OF THIS

04:59:09.731 --> 04:59:11.166
BILL. I'M A STRONG SUPPORTER OF

04:59:11.233 --> 04:59:12.901
THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT, AND

04:59:12.968 --> 04:59:14.169
AS THE COMMITTEE KNOWS, THE

04:59:14.236 --> 04:59:15.804
PROJECT HAS FACED MANY

04:59:15.871 --> 04:59:17.205
CHALLENGES, IN LARGE PART DUE TO

04:59:17.272 --> 04:59:18.774
A LACK OF STABLE FUNDING SOURCE.

04:59:18.840 --> 04:59:20.809
BUT IT HAS ALSO ENCOUNTERED

04:59:20.876 --> 04:59:22.678
COSTLY DELAYS BECAUSE OF THE

04:59:22.744 --> 04:59:24.079
DIFFICULTY ASSOCIATED WITH

04:59:24.146 --> 04:59:25.213
RELOCATING RELOCATING THIRD

04:59:25.280 --> 04:59:26.882
PARTY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS IN

04:59:26.948 --> 04:59:28.684
THE PATH OF THIS PROJECT,

04:59:28.750 --> 04:59:29.785
AUTHORIZING THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

04:59:29.851 --> 04:59:31.620
AUTHORITY TO ADOPT REGULATIONS

04:59:31.687 --> 04:59:33.055
TO GOVERN THE THIRD PARTY

04:59:33.121 --> 04:59:34.856
PROCESS SHOULD HELP TO MINIMIZE

04:59:34.923 --> 04:59:36.692
DELAYS AND REDUCE THE COST

04:59:36.758 --> 04:59:38.093
ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE DELAYS.

04:59:38.160 --> 04:59:39.461
THIS APPROACH IS CONSISTENT WITH

04:59:39.528 --> 04:59:41.763
THE RECOMMENDATION BY THE

04:59:41.830 --> 04:59:43.098
INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR THIS

04:59:43.165 --> 04:59:44.966
PROJECT. AND TOO BAD WE DID NOT

04:59:45.033 --> 04:59:46.034
HAVE AN INSPECTOR GENERAL WHEN

04:59:46.101 --> 04:59:47.502
WE STARTED THIS PROJECT. I THINK

04:59:47.569 --> 04:59:49.338
WE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

04:59:49.404 --> 04:59:51.373
ADDRESS QUITE A BIT OF THINGS.

04:59:51.440 --> 04:59:53.208
WE KNOW THAT THERE, AS I

04:59:53.275 --> 04:59:54.509
MENTIONED REIMBURSEMENT EARLIER,

04:59:54.576 --> 04:59:56.178
WE KNOW THAT THERE'S EXISTING

04:59:56.244 --> 04:59:57.612
STATUTORY LANGUAGE ON THIS, BUT

04:59:57.679 --> 04:59:58.647
I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT IT'S

04:59:58.714 --> 05:00:00.749
NARROWLY DRAFTED. AND SO I

05:00:00.816 --> 05:00:01.950
APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO

05:00:02.017 --> 05:00:03.752
CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT, TO

05:00:03.819 --> 05:00:05.620
ENSURE THAT WE DON'T PUT

05:00:05.687 --> 05:00:07.189
ADDITIONAL COSTS ON OUR

05:00:07.255 --> 05:00:09.524
RATEPAYERS OR CONSUMERS. THIS

05:00:09.591 --> 05:00:11.526
BILL WILL GO TO ASSEMBLY LOCAL

05:00:11.593 --> 05:00:14.062
GOV, AS WELL AS ASSEMBLY,

05:00:14.129 --> 05:00:15.364
UTILITIES AND ENERGY, BECAUSE

05:00:15.430 --> 05:00:18.166
THE AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL HAVE

05:00:18.233 --> 05:00:19.167
BEEN IN PRINT FOR ONLY A FEW

05:00:19.234 --> 05:00:20.435
DAYS, IT WILL BE IMPORTANT TO

05:00:20.502 --> 05:00:22.671
HEAR AND CONSIDER WAYS TO

05:00:22.738 --> 05:00:23.872
ADDRESS ALL THE CONCERNS RAISED

05:00:23.939 --> 05:00:26.208
TODAY BY SOME OF THE MEMBERS, AS

05:00:26.274 --> 05:00:27.776
WELL AS IN THOSE COMMITTEES. I

05:00:27.843 --> 05:00:29.010
WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL

05:00:29.077 --> 05:00:30.445
TODAY. GIVEN THAT WE HAVE A

05:00:30.512 --> 05:00:32.414

05:00:32.481 --> 05:00:33.615

AND SENATOR BARRASSO. MY GOAL

05:00:52.067 --> 05:00:55.504

COME TO FRUITION. AND I'LL TELL

05:02:53.622 --> 05:02:55.423
YOU WHY. BECAUSE WE DO HOPE THAT

05:02:55.490 --> 05:02:56.358
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES

05:02:56.424 --> 05:02:58.760

05:03:02.564 --> 05:03:03.798
PRESSURE ON THE FEDERAL

05:03:03.865 --> 05:03:04.599
GOVERNMENT TO MAINTAIN CRASH

05:03:04.666 --> 05:03:06.201
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND OF

05:03:06.268 --> 05:03:07.736
COURSE, CREATE A BACKSTOP IN

05:03:07.802 --> 05:03:10.105
CASE THEY DO NOT. THE BILL HAS

05:03:10.171 --> 05:03:11.540

AUTHORING THIS BILL. AND LIKE

05:03:33.895 --> 05:03:35.964
HER, WE HOPE THAT IT NEVER HAS

05:03:36.031 --> 05:03:38.033
TO BE IMPLEMENTED BECAUSE WE'RE

05:03:38.099 --> 05:03:41.369
HOPING THAT THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY

05:03:41.436 --> 05:03:42.804
TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION

05:03:42.871 --> 05:03:45.340
GETS THE MESSAGE FROM CALIFORNIA

05:03:45.407 --> 05:03:48.109
AND CONTINUES TO GATHER THE DATA

05:03:48.176 --> 05:03:50.545
ON THEIR OWN. AND WE WOULD

05:03:50.612 --> 05:03:52.781
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE

05:03:52.847 --> 05:03:56.518
VOTE. GOOD EVENING AGAIN, CHAIR

AND MEMBERS MARK SHEETS FOR ALL

05:03:58.720 --> 05:04:00.455
I THINK SIMILARLY. YEAH, WE

05:04:00.522 --> 05:04:01.756
THINK THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY

05:04:01.823 --> 05:04:04.359
IMPORTANT BACKSTOP TO A

05:04:04.426 --> 05:04:06.194
TUMULTUOUS POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT

05:04:06.261 --> 05:04:09.831
AROUND ADAS LEVEL TWO VEHICLES.

05:04:09.898 --> 05:04:10.832
ULTIMATELY, STREETS FRAWLEY'S

05:04:10.899 --> 05:04:12.400
POSITION AROUND AUTONOMOUS

05:04:12.467 --> 05:04:14.002
VEHICLES IS A IS A NUANCED ONE

05:04:14.069 --> 05:04:15.837
IN WHICH WE SEE AN EMERGING

05:04:15.904 --> 05:04:18.139
TECHNOLOGY THAT I THINK OFFERS A

05:04:18.206 --> 05:04:19.207
LOT OF HOPE AND POTENTIAL AND

05:04:19.274 --> 05:04:20.275
YET IS OFTENTIMES, I THINK,

05:04:20.342 --> 05:04:23.178
BEING TRIED OUT ON OUR STREETS.

05:04:23.244 --> 05:04:23.945
AND I THINK ULTIMATELY WHAT WE

05:04:24.012 --> 05:04:26.081
WANT IS WE JUST WE WANT TO BE

05:04:26.147 --> 05:04:27.816
ABLE TO GET THE DATA TO MAKE

05:04:27.882 --> 05:04:28.416

LEGISLATURE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE

05:04:31.286 --> 05:04:32.320
INFORMED DECISIONS. SO THE DATA

05:04:32.387 --> 05:04:34.155
TAP IS TURNED OFF. WE WORRY

05:04:34.222 --> 05:04:35.824
ABOUT THE RESULTS. AND SO THIS

05:04:35.890 --> 05:04:37.292
THIS BILL SOLVES THAT PROBLEM.

GOVERNMENTS TO PERFORM EMERGENCY

05:06:56.498 --> 05:06:58.133
SUMMARY ABATEMENT OF ABANDONED

05:06:58.199 --> 05:06:59.434
OR INOPERABLE VEHICLES THAT ARE

05:06:59.501 --> 05:07:02.270
CREATING AN IMMINENT HAZARD TO

05:07:02.337 --> 05:07:04.005
HEALTH OR SAFETY. I WOULD LIKE

05:07:04.072 --> 05:07:06.241

05:07:06.307 --> 05:07:07.075
BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE

05:07:07.142 --> 05:07:08.276
AMENDMENTS AT STRIKE SECTION TWO

05:07:08.343 --> 05:07:10.145
OF THE BILL, AS IT WAS LARGELY

05:07:10.211 --> 05:07:11.813
REDUNDANT OF EXISTING LAW, AND I

05:07:11.880 --> 05:07:12.380
WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE

05:07:12.447 --> 05:07:14.816
STAFF FOR THEIR WORK. AND THE

05:07:14.883 --> 05:07:15.617
CHAIR ON THE BILL. ABANDONED

05:07:15.683 --> 05:07:16.351
OPERABLE VEHICLES ARE A

05:07:16.417 --> 05:07:17.352
SIGNIFICANT ISSUE IN OUR

05:07:17.418 --> 05:07:18.153
COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE

05:07:18.219 --> 05:07:19.220
STATE, AND ESPECIALLY THE CITIES

05:07:19.287 --> 05:07:20.889
THAT I REPRESENT OF OAKLAND AND

05:07:20.955 --> 05:07:22.090
BERKELEY. THESE VEHICLES ARE

05:07:22.157 --> 05:07:23.591
LINING THE STREETS OF MY CITIES

05:07:23.658 --> 05:07:24.225
AND IN CITIES THROUGHOUT THE

05:07:24.292 --> 05:07:26.127
STATE DUE TO ILLEGAL DUMPING, OR

05:07:26.194 --> 05:07:27.495
BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN LEFT BEHIND

05:07:27.562 --> 05:07:29.898
AFTER PEOPLE WHO WERE PREVIOUSLY

05:07:29.964 --> 05:07:31.699
HOMELESS HAVE MOVED INDOORS. IN

05:07:31.766 --> 05:07:33.234
MANY CASES, THESE VEHICLES ARE

05:07:33.301 --> 05:07:34.235
IN SUCH POOR CONDITION AND POSE

05:07:34.302 --> 05:07:35.904
SUCH SERIOUS HEALTH AND SAFETY

05:07:35.970 --> 05:07:36.938
RISKS THAT TOWING COMPANIES

05:07:37.005 --> 05:07:38.973
SIMPLY REFUSE TO TAKE THEM. DUE

05:07:39.040 --> 05:07:40.208
TO THE PRESCRIPTIVE REQUIREMENTS

05:07:40.275 --> 05:07:41.509
IN EXISTING LAW, LOCAL

05:07:41.576 --> 05:07:42.911
GOVERNMENTS HAVE VERY FEW

05:07:42.977 --> 05:07:44.312
OPTIONS TO ABATE AND REMOVE

05:07:44.379 --> 05:07:46.114
THEM. SB 692 WOULD AMEND THE

05:07:46.181 --> 05:07:47.248
CURRENT REQUIREMENT FOR LOCAL

05:07:47.315 --> 05:07:48.616
GOVERNMENTS TO BE ABLE TO REMOVE

05:07:48.683 --> 05:07:50.852
ABANDONED OR INOPERABLE VEHICLES

05:07:50.919 --> 05:07:52.487
VALUED AT LESS THAN $200, BY

05:07:52.554 --> 05:07:53.655
REQUIRING THAT A LOCAL

05:07:53.721 --> 05:07:55.490
GOVERNMENT EITHER DETERMINE THE

05:07:55.557 --> 05:07:56.925
VEHICLE IS A PUBLIC NUISANCE,

05:07:56.991 --> 05:07:58.126
PRESENTING AN IMMINENT THREAT TO

05:07:58.193 --> 05:07:59.828
HEALTH AND SAFETY, OR THAT THE

05:07:59.894 --> 05:08:01.262
PROPERTY OWNER SIGNS A RELEASE

05:08:01.329 --> 05:08:02.630
AUTHORIZING THE REMOVAL OF THE

05:08:02.697 --> 05:08:04.465
VEHICLE. CURRENT LAW REQUIRES

05:08:04.532 --> 05:08:06.000
BOTH THE HEALTH AND SAFETY

05:08:06.067 --> 05:08:07.669
DETERMINATION AND A SIGNED

05:08:07.735 --> 05:08:08.837
RELEASE. IN INSTANCES WHERE A

05:08:08.903 --> 05:08:09.971
VEHICLE IS ABANDONED, IT CAN BE

05:08:10.038 --> 05:08:12.006
VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND THE OWNER

05:08:12.073 --> 05:08:13.241
OF AN ABANDONED VEHICLE TO BE

05:08:13.308 --> 05:08:15.243
ABLE TO COMPLY WITH THE EXISTING

05:08:15.310 --> 05:08:16.611
STATUTE. THIS BILL IS A MODERATE

05:08:16.678 --> 05:08:18.580
CHANGE IN THE VEHICLE CODE THAT

05:08:18.646 --> 05:08:19.581
WILL HELP CITIES ADDRESS THIS

05:08:19.647 --> 05:08:22.116
PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUE,

05:08:22.183 --> 05:08:23.618
WHILE PRESERVING ADEQUATE DUE

05:08:23.685 --> 05:08:24.452
PROCESS PROTECTIONS. I'LL JUST

05:22:29.730 --> 05:22:33.901
YOUR MONEY. YEAH. FOR SURE. ALL

05:22:33.967 --> 05:22:35.269
RIGHT, WELL, I'M HERE TO PRESENT

05:22:35.335 --> 05:22:37.271
SB 720 THE SAFER STREETS ACT.

05:22:37.337 --> 05:22:39.006
I'LL BE AS SUCCINCT AS I CAN.

05:22:39.073 --> 05:22:40.974
HAVE SOME REALLY GOOD WITNESSES

05:22:41.041 --> 05:22:42.676
WITH ME THAT I AM EXCITED FOR

05:22:42.743 --> 05:22:44.712
YOU TO MEET. NEED TO SAY THANK

05:22:44.778 --> 05:22:46.380
YOU TO YOUR CHAIRWOMAN AND TO

05:22:46.447 --> 05:22:47.915
YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF, WHO WORKED

05:22:47.981 --> 05:22:49.550
REALLY HARD ON THIS BILL FOR

05:22:49.616 --> 05:22:51.285
SEVERAL WEEKS WITH ME, AND I'M

05:22:51.351 --> 05:22:52.953
VERY, VERY GRATEFUL. I THINK THE

05:22:53.020 --> 05:22:54.321
BILL IS BETTER FOR YOUR

05:22:54.388 --> 05:22:55.889
PARTICIPATION AND INPUT. WE WILL

05:22:55.956 --> 05:22:58.425
BE ACCEPTING SOME PROPOSED

05:22:58.492 --> 05:22:59.860
COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT I'LL

05:22:59.927 --> 05:23:02.129
JUST SHARE WITH YOU BRIEFLY SO

05:23:02.196 --> 05:23:03.097
THAT YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE,

05:23:03.163 --> 05:23:04.131
SINCE THEY I DON'T THINK WILL BE

05:23:04.198 --> 05:23:06.200
IN FRONT OF YOU. WE'RE GOING TO

05:23:06.266 --> 05:23:08.068
ADD VIDEO EVIDENCE INTO THE BILL

05:23:08.135 --> 05:23:09.303
CONSISTENT WITH THE EXISTING RED

05:23:09.369 --> 05:23:10.871
LIGHT CAMERA PROGRAMS. WE'RE

05:23:10.938 --> 05:23:12.272
GOING TO CHANGE THE FINE FROM A

05:23:12.339 --> 05:23:13.874
FLAT 100FT TO 100 FOR THE FIRST

05:23:13.941 --> 05:23:15.242
VÌ POBLACIÓN, 200 FOR THE

05:23:15.309 --> 05:23:17.344
SECOND, 250 FOR THE THIRD, AND

05:23:17.411 --> 05:23:18.679
500 FOR ALL FOLLOWING VIOLATIONS

05:23:18.746 --> 05:23:19.580
WITHIN THE THREE YEAR PERIOD

05:23:19.646 --> 05:23:21.014
BEFORE THEY CLEAR THEMSELVES,

05:23:21.081 --> 05:23:22.416
WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE THE LATE

05:23:22.483 --> 05:23:24.218
FEE FROM 50% OF THE FINE TO $50

05:23:24.284 --> 05:23:26.019
FOR THE FIRST VIOLATION. 100 FOR

05:23:26.086 --> 05:23:27.321
ALL FOLLOWING VIOLATIONS REQUIRE

05:23:27.387 --> 05:23:28.989
AN AFFIDAVIT THAT THE YELLOW

05:23:29.056 --> 05:23:30.924
LIGHT INTERVAL WAS ESTABLISHED

05:23:30.991 --> 05:23:32.893
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MANUAL ON

05:23:32.960 --> 05:23:34.661
UNIFORM TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES

05:23:34.728 --> 05:23:36.063
AND FINALLY, REQUIRE THE

05:23:36.130 --> 05:23:37.431
AUTOMATED TRAFFIC ENFORCEMENT

05:23:37.498 --> 05:23:39.032
SYSTEM TO BE ANGLED AND FOCUSED

05:23:39.099 --> 05:23:41.168
SO AS TO ONLY CAPTURE REAR

05:23:41.235 --> 05:23:42.936
LICENSE PLATES. SO THOSE ARE THE

05:23:43.003 --> 05:23:44.037
AMENDMENTS WE'RE GOING TO MAKE

05:23:44.104 --> 05:23:45.239
FROM YOUR COMMITTEE. I THANK YOU

05:23:45.305 --> 05:23:47.007
VERY MUCH FOR YOUR HELP ON

05:23:47.074 --> 05:23:48.575
THOSE. SB 720 ALLOWS CITIES TO

05:23:48.642 --> 05:23:50.611
OPT IN TO A NEW RED LIGHT CAMERA

05:23:50.677 --> 05:23:52.312
SYSTEM FOR HIGH COLLISION ZONES,

05:23:52.379 --> 05:23:54.448
WHICH PROVIDES A VITAL TOOL TO

05:23:54.515 --> 05:23:57.618
REDUCE TRAFFIC FATALITIES. IN

05:23:57.684 --> 05:24:00.587
2021 ALONE, WE LOST 4000

05:24:00.654 --> 05:24:02.389
CALIFORNIANS TO TRAFFIC

05:24:02.456 --> 05:24:04.224
COLLISIONS HERE IN OUR STATE,

05:24:04.291 --> 05:24:05.225
WITH MORE THAN A QUARTER OF

05:24:05.292 --> 05:24:06.727
THOSE DEATHS RESULTING FROM

05:24:06.794 --> 05:24:09.596
DRIVERS WHO RAN A RED LIGHT. THE

05:24:09.663 --> 05:24:11.365
OUTDATED AND EXPENSIVE STRUCTURE

05:24:11.431 --> 05:24:12.733
OF OUR CURRENT RED LIGHT CAMERA

05:24:12.800 --> 05:24:15.302
PROGRAM HAS PROVEN TO BE

05:24:15.369 --> 05:24:16.804
WOEFULLY INEFFECTIVE. AND IF

05:24:16.870 --> 05:24:18.405
THERE'S ONE THING I HAVE LEARNED

05:24:18.472 --> 05:24:20.741
IN THIS BILL, IT'S THAT THE

05:24:20.808 --> 05:24:22.142
HATRED OF RED LIGHT CAMERAS

05:24:22.209 --> 05:24:25.078
UNITES US ACROSS MANY FRONTS.

05:24:25.145 --> 05:24:27.881
THAT IS A TRUE DISDAIN FROM THE

05:24:27.948 --> 05:24:29.016
LEGISLATURE. CURRENTLY, UNLIKE

05:24:29.082 --> 05:24:30.417
OTHER STATES, CALIFORNIA HOLDS

05:24:30.484 --> 05:24:32.019
DRIVERS RESPONSIBLE FOR

05:24:32.085 --> 05:24:33.720
VIOLATIONS REQUIRING PHOTOS OF A

05:24:33.787 --> 05:24:35.455
PERSON'S FACE, AND THE DRIVER

05:24:35.522 --> 05:24:37.658
CAN'T BE IDENTIFIED. IT

05:24:37.724 --> 05:24:38.826
BASICALLY ASKS THE REGISTERED

05:24:38.892 --> 05:24:40.294
VEHICLE OWNER TO TELL WHO THE

05:24:40.360 --> 05:24:41.428
PERSON WAS, AND THE SYSTEM JUST

05:24:41.495 --> 05:24:43.864
IS ARCHAIC AND DOES NOT WORK IF

05:24:43.931 --> 05:24:45.499
IDENTIFIED. IF IDENTIFIED,

05:24:45.566 --> 05:24:47.067
VIOLATORS ARE SUBJECT TO A

05:24:47.134 --> 05:24:49.069
CRIMINAL PENALTY, WHICH INCLUDES

05:24:49.136 --> 05:24:51.705
A FINE UPWARDS OF $500, AND THEN

05:24:51.772 --> 05:24:53.507
ADDS POINTS ONTO THEIR DRIVER'S

05:24:53.574 --> 05:24:55.309
LICENSE. THAT'S ALSO VERY

05:24:55.375 --> 05:24:56.710
POPULAR. ALONG WITH TRAFFIC

05:24:56.777 --> 05:24:58.979
COURT. WE'RE GOING TO GET RID OF

05:24:59.046 --> 05:25:01.114
ALL OF THAT. AS WE KNOW, THE

05:25:01.181 --> 05:25:02.382
INSURANCE RATES ARE REALLY FUN

05:25:02.449 --> 05:25:03.283
TO DEAL WITH AFTER RED LIGHT. WE

05:25:03.350 --> 05:25:06.186
DON'T NEED TO DO THAT. WE'RE ALL

05:25:06.253 --> 05:25:07.521
WORKING SO HARD TO REDUCE COSTS

05:25:07.588 --> 05:25:08.222
FOR CALIFORNIANS. THERE'S NO

05:25:08.288 --> 05:25:10.057
REASON TO DO THIS. INSTEAD, SB

05:25:10.123 --> 05:25:13.660
720 SHIFTS THAT ENTIRE FRAMEWORK

05:25:13.727 --> 05:25:15.462
AWAY FROM THE EXISTING PENAL

05:25:15.529 --> 05:25:16.797
CODE AND INSTEAD FOCUSES ON

05:25:16.864 --> 05:25:20.067
DRIVER LIABILITY TO SHIFTS FROM

05:25:20.133 --> 05:25:21.668
DRIVER LIABILITY TO OWNER

05:25:21.735 --> 05:25:23.103
LIABILITY, REMOVING ANY NEED FOR

05:25:23.170 --> 05:25:25.172
FACIAL ID PROGRAMS. THINK ABOUT

05:25:25.239 --> 05:25:27.007
WHEN YOU CROSS A TOLL BRIDGE AND

05:25:27.074 --> 05:25:28.609
A CAMERA CAPTURES YOUR PLATE.

05:25:28.675 --> 05:25:29.877
THAT'S WHAT THIS PROGRAM WILL

05:25:29.943 --> 05:25:31.712
DO. IT CHANGES THE VIOLATION

05:25:31.778 --> 05:25:34.248
FROM CRIMINAL TO CIVIL. IT

05:25:34.314 --> 05:25:35.916
LIMITS THE FIRST FINE AS YOU

05:25:35.983 --> 05:25:37.050
KNOW, DIRECTS FUNDING BACK

05:25:37.117 --> 05:25:38.385
TOWARDS SAFE, MULTI-MODAL

05:25:38.452 --> 05:25:39.720
TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS. THIS IS

05:25:39.786 --> 05:25:41.788
A BIG PIECE FUNDING INTO YOUR

05:25:41.855 --> 05:25:43.891
COMMUNITIES FOR INFRASTRUCTURE.

05:25:43.957 --> 05:25:45.392
THOSE OF US WHO HAVE SERVED ON

05:25:45.459 --> 05:25:47.127
LOCAL BOARDS KNOW HOW IMPORTANT

05:25:47.194 --> 05:25:48.962
THAT IS AND HOW DIFFICULT IT IS

05:25:49.029 --> 05:25:50.831
TO FIND THAT THAT FUNDING LOCAL

05:25:50.898 --> 05:25:51.999
GOVERNMENT MAY CHOOSE TO OPT IN

05:25:52.065 --> 05:25:53.033
TO THE SAFER STREETS PROGRAM.

05:25:53.100 --> 05:25:55.202
BUT HERE'S WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO

05:25:55.269 --> 05:25:56.203
FIRST. FIRST, THEY HAVE TO

05:25:56.270 --> 05:25:57.237
DEVELOP GUIDELINES FOR SCREENING

05:25:57.304 --> 05:25:58.605
AND ISSUING VIOLATIONS. THEY

05:25:58.672 --> 05:26:00.240
HAVE TO DEVELOP GUIDELINES FOR

05:26:00.307 --> 05:26:01.575
SELECTING THE LOCATIONS TO

05:26:01.642 --> 05:26:02.943
INSTALL THESE SYSTEMS. AND IT

05:26:03.010 --> 05:26:04.878
HAS TO BE BASED ON COLLISION

05:26:04.945 --> 05:26:05.879
ANALYSIS, MEANING WHERE THE

05:26:05.946 --> 05:26:07.080
ACCIDENTS ARE HAPPENING. AND

05:26:07.147 --> 05:26:08.682
THEY MUST SUBMIT AN ANNUAL

05:26:08.749 --> 05:26:10.183
REPORT ON DATA FROM THE

05:26:10.250 --> 05:26:12.019
AUTOMATED TRAFFIC ENFORCEMENT

05:26:12.085 --> 05:26:14.554
SYSTEM. SB 720 ENSURES THAT

05:26:14.621 --> 05:26:15.622
CITIES HAVE TOOLS NEEDED TO

05:26:15.689 --> 05:26:17.357
CREATE SAFER STREETS, MAKING

05:26:17.424 --> 05:26:18.792
THIS A CRITICAL STEP TOWARDS

05:26:18.859 --> 05:26:21.028
REDUCING TRAFFIC COLLISIONS IN

05:26:21.094 --> 05:26:22.796
CALIFORNIA. THE BILL IMPROVES

05:26:22.863 --> 05:26:24.631
SAFETY DECRIMINALIZES TRAFFIC

05:26:24.698 --> 05:26:26.133
VIOLATIONS, REDUCES FINES, FEES

05:26:26.199 --> 05:26:28.235
AND INSURANCE BURDENS, AND SAVES

05:26:28.302 --> 05:26:29.903
THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS

05:26:29.970 --> 05:26:30.804
DRIVING THROUGHOUT THE GOLDEN

05:26:30.871 --> 05:26:32.205
STATE. WITH ME TODAY, I HAVE

05:26:32.272 --> 05:26:33.040
ACTUALLY A LONG TIME PERSONAL

05:26:33.106 --> 05:26:34.474
FRIEND AND A REALLY WONDERFUL

05:26:34.541 --> 05:26:36.009
PART OF THE SACRAMENTO POLICE

05:26:36.076 --> 05:26:37.277
DEPARTMENT DEPUTY CHIEF OF

05:26:37.344 --> 05:26:38.946
POLICE. ALTHOUGH I MET HIM, I

05:26:39.012 --> 05:26:40.881
THINK HE WAS A SERGEANT, ADAM

05:26:40.948 --> 05:26:43.650
GREEN, AND ALSO WITH ME, THE

05:26:43.717 --> 05:26:45.886
REALLY AMAZING STORY. AND YOU

05:26:45.953 --> 05:26:48.221
MAY HAVE NOTICED HIS HIS LEG AND

05:26:48.288 --> 05:26:50.624
HOPEFULLY HE'LL TELL YOU ABOUT

05:26:50.691 --> 05:26:51.325
THAT TODAY. T I WELLS, WHO IS

05:26:51.391 --> 05:26:54.061
HERE ON BEHALF OF STREETS ARE

05:26:54.127 --> 05:26:55.028
FOR EVERYONE AND A COUPLE OF

05:26:55.095 --> 05:26:56.930
TECHNICAL FOLKS WITH US AS WELL.

05:26:56.997 --> 05:26:59.866
OKAY, BEFORE WE GO ON TO

05:26:59.933 --> 05:27:00.400
TESTIMONY, I JUST WANT TO

05:27:00.467 --> 05:27:01.101
CLARIFY FOR THE MEN'S THAT

05:27:01.168 --> 05:27:04.104
YOU'RE TAKING INCLUDE AND IT'S

05:27:04.171 --> 05:27:07.074
ON OUR IN OUR ANALYSIS THAT THE

05:27:07.140 --> 05:27:08.408
PERSON SHALL NOT BE ASSESSED AS

05:27:08.475 --> 05:27:09.109
CIVIL PENALTY IF THEY ARE

05:27:09.176 --> 05:27:11.211
SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL PENALTIES

05:27:11.278 --> 05:27:12.646
FOR THE SAME ACT, AND ALSO THAT

05:27:12.713 --> 05:27:13.947
THE GUIDELINES FOR THE RIGHT

05:27:14.014 --> 05:27:16.083
TURNS ON RED, THE VIOLATIONS FOR

05:27:16.149 --> 05:27:17.718
RIGHTS ON RED. CORRECT. AND THE

05:27:17.784 --> 05:27:19.653
RIGHT TURN ON RED WOULD REQUIRE

05:27:19.720 --> 05:27:21.822
THAT THE CITIES HAVE A POLICY TO

05:27:21.888 --> 05:27:23.490
ADDRESS IT. YES. RIGHT. CORRECT.

05:27:23.557 --> 05:27:25.425
YES, ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU. ALL

05:27:25.492 --> 05:27:28.695
RIGHT. TO THE WITNESSES, YOU MAY

05:27:28.762 --> 05:27:33.400
EITHER ONE, CHIEF. HELLO,

05:27:33.467 --> 05:27:34.901
COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS TY WELLS

05:27:34.968 --> 05:27:36.603
AND I'M A MEMBER OF SAFE

05:27:36.670 --> 05:27:38.205
FAMILIES, A COMMUNITY FOR PEOPLE

05:27:38.271 --> 05:27:39.973
WHOSE LIVES HAVE BEEN IMPACTED

05:27:40.040 --> 05:27:41.675
BY TRAFFIC VIOLENCE. I'M HERE IN

05:27:41.742 --> 05:27:44.177
SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL 720. IN

05:27:44.244 --> 05:27:46.980
2021 ALONE, OVER 4200

05:27:47.047 --> 05:27:48.515
CALIFORNIANS DIED IN TRAFFIC

05:27:48.582 --> 05:27:49.383
COLLISIONS. MORE THAN A QUARTER

05:27:49.449 --> 05:27:50.584
OF THOSE DEATHS INVOLVED SOMEONE

05:27:50.650 --> 05:27:52.419
RUNNING A RED LIGHT. I'M ONE OF

05:27:52.486 --> 05:27:53.754
THOSE PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES WERE

05:27:53.820 --> 05:27:54.955
FOREVER CHANGED BY SOMEONE

05:27:55.022 --> 05:27:57.057
RUNNING A RED LIGHT. I'VE BEEN A

05:27:57.124 --> 05:27:58.158
PROFESSIONAL DANCER IN LOS

05:27:58.225 --> 05:27:59.259
ANGELES FOR OVER A DECADE,

05:27:59.326 --> 05:28:00.527
PERFORMING WITH ARTISTS LIKE

05:28:00.594 --> 05:28:01.428
KATY PERRY, SHAWN MENDES, AND

05:28:01.495 --> 05:28:03.130
PINK, TO NAME A FEW, AS WELL AS

05:28:03.196 --> 05:28:05.432
A 4.0 STUDENT AT UCLA. I HAD

05:28:05.499 --> 05:28:07.034
WORKED HARD TO BUILD A CAREER I

05:28:07.100 --> 05:28:08.268
LOVED AND DREAMED OF CONTINUING

05:28:08.335 --> 05:28:10.737
DOING IT FOR YEARS TO COME. BUT

05:28:10.804 --> 05:28:12.005
ON APRIL 3RD, 2022, THOSE DREAMS

05:28:12.072 --> 05:28:14.207
WERE CUT SHORT AS I WAS HIT BY

05:28:14.274 --> 05:28:16.209
AN SUV THAT RAN A RED LIGHT

05:28:16.276 --> 05:28:17.244
WHILE I WAS HEADING HOME FROM

05:28:17.310 --> 05:28:19.046
WORK. THE CRASH GAVE ME A

05:28:19.112 --> 05:28:20.180
DIFFUSE AXONAL BRAIN INJURY,

05:28:20.247 --> 05:28:20.847
MEANING THE COMMUNICATION

05:28:20.914 --> 05:28:22.449
WIRING, AND MY BRAIN WAS

05:28:22.516 --> 05:28:24.351
COMPLETELY TORN AND PUT ME IN A

05:28:24.418 --> 05:28:26.286
COMA. DOCTORS TOLD MY FAMILY AND

05:28:26.353 --> 05:28:27.320
FRIENDS TO PREPARE THEMSELVES,

05:28:27.387 --> 05:28:29.089
AS MOST PEOPLE WITH THIS KIND OF

05:28:29.156 --> 05:28:30.891
INJURY NEVER WAKE UP.

05:28:30.957 --> 05:28:32.325
MIRACULOUSLY, I DID SIX DAYS

05:28:32.392 --> 05:28:34.127

PARALYZED AND MY LEFT LEG HAD TO

BE ARE YOU CONCERNED OR HOW HAVE

05:33:24.084 --> 05:33:26.453

IT'S GOING CIVIL? AND PRETTY

05:33:28.321 --> 05:33:30.123
MUCH IF MY KIDS ARE DRIVING MY

05:33:30.190 --> 05:33:31.691

05:33:31.758 --> 05:33:33.326

05:33:37.030 --> 05:33:38.365
BUT I GUESS MY QUESTION IS, IS

05:33:38.431 --> 05:33:40.600
HOW HAVE WE ANALYZED HOW THAT

05:33:40.667 --> 05:33:44.504
COULD POTENTIALLY IMPACT THE

05:33:44.571 --> 05:33:45.305
EFFECTIVENESS, SINCE NOW WE'RE

05:33:45.372 --> 05:33:47.340

05:33:47.407 --> 05:33:48.842
PENALTIES THAT GO ON THEIR

05:33:48.908 --> 05:33:50.944
DRIVING RECORD. I JUST WANT TO

05:33:51.010 --> 05:33:53.179
MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE STILL

05:33:53.246 --> 05:33:53.880

JUST A CIVIL PENALTY AND WE

05:34:04.124 --> 05:34:05.992
CAN'T IDENTIFY WHO WAS ACTUALLY

05:34:06.059 --> 05:34:10.430
DRIVING THE CAR? YOUR YOUR MIC

05:34:10.497 --> 05:34:12.332

05:34:13.466 --> 05:34:14.768

EITHER WE ARE THE LAST STATE OR

05:34:29.916 --> 05:34:31.818
THE SECOND TO LAST STATE. I

05:34:31.885 --> 05:34:33.086
DON'T I'M NOT 100% CERTAIN ON

05:34:33.153 --> 05:34:34.521

05:35:18.998 --> 05:35:20.967
I HAVE TO SAY THAT I HAVE

05:35:21.034 --> 05:35:21.835
RESERVATIONS ABOUT THIS

05:35:21.901 --> 05:35:23.069
PARTICULAR PROPOSAL. BECAUSE OF

05:35:23.136 --> 05:35:26.206
THIS, ALL RED LIGHT VIOLATIONS

05:35:26.272 --> 05:35:28.975
ARE NOT CREATED EQUAL, AND THE

05:35:29.042 --> 05:35:30.610
MAJORITY OF THESE CAMERA

05:35:30.677 --> 05:35:32.445
ENFORCEMENT ARE NOT PEOPLE

05:35:32.512 --> 05:35:34.681
BLOWING INTERSECTIONS. THEY'RE

05:35:34.747 --> 05:35:36.115
PEOPLE NOT STOPPING BEHIND THE

05:35:36.182 --> 05:35:39.018
LIMIT LINE. SO THEY COME TO A

05:35:39.085 --> 05:35:40.620
STOP, BUT THEY STOP TOO LATE.

05:35:40.687 --> 05:35:42.489
AND THE OTHER THING IS THE RIGHT

05:35:42.555 --> 05:35:44.090
TURN. AS THEY MENTIONED BEFORE,

05:35:44.157 --> 05:35:46.159
THOSE ARE THE MAJORITY. THE

05:35:46.226 --> 05:35:47.293
MAJORITY OF THESE KIND OF

05:35:47.360 --> 05:35:49.796
TRAFFIC ENFORCEMENTS. THAT'S WHY

05:35:49.863 --> 05:35:51.598
THEY'RE SO DESPISED BY THE

05:35:51.664 --> 05:35:53.733
PUBLIC, AND THAT'S WHY THEY

05:35:53.800 --> 05:35:55.835
BECOME A FRUSTRATION BY THE

05:35:55.902 --> 05:35:57.637
PUBLIC, BECAUSE THERE'S NO

05:35:57.704 --> 05:35:59.205
DISCRETION ON THE ENFORCEMENT.

05:35:59.272 --> 05:36:00.573
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

05:36:00.640 --> 05:36:02.709
HAVING AN OFFICER TAKE

05:36:02.775 --> 05:36:03.810
ENFORCEMENT, BECAUSE THEY WOULD

05:36:03.877 --> 05:36:05.912
TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A

05:36:05.979 --> 05:36:08.848
ROLLING STOP AND YOU, YOU'D MAKE

05:36:08.915 --> 05:36:10.149
MAYBE AN ENFORCEMENT CONTACT.

05:36:10.216 --> 05:36:12.118
BUT I WOULD THINK THAT USUALLY A

05:36:12.185 --> 05:36:13.453
VERBAL WARNING WOULD BE

05:36:13.520 --> 05:36:14.587
APPROPRIATE. THERE'S NO VERBAL

05:36:14.654 --> 05:36:16.022
WARNINGS WITH A CAMERA. AND FOR

05:36:16.089 --> 05:36:18.358
THAT REASON I'M NOT ABLE TO

05:36:18.424 --> 05:36:19.959
SUPPORT. I'M NOT I'M NOT GOING

05:36:20.026 --> 05:36:21.895
TO VOTE AGAINST IT BECAUSE THAT

05:36:21.961 --> 05:36:23.396
MAKES IT LOOK LIKE I'M NOT

05:36:23.463 --> 05:36:24.364
SENSITIVE TO THIS, THIS PROBLEM.

05:36:24.430 --> 05:36:29.435
BUT I AM. BUT I'M NOT A FAN OF

05:36:29.502 --> 05:36:30.136
CAMERA ENFORCEMENT FOR THOSE

05:36:30.203 --> 05:36:33.540
REASONS. THANK YOU. IF IT WOULD

05:36:33.606 --> 05:36:36.209
BE THROUGH THE CHAIR, COULD THE

05:36:36.276 --> 05:36:38.411
DEPUTY CHIEF ANSWER TO SOME OF

05:36:38.478 --> 05:36:39.212
THOSE QUESTIONS WOULD BE, ALL

05:36:39.279 --> 05:36:40.914
RIGHT, WELL, HE HE HE JUST MADE

05:36:40.980 --> 05:36:43.049
COMMENTS AND HE'S NOTING THAT HE

05:36:43.116 --> 05:36:44.050
DID NOT ASK THE QUESTION. SO

05:36:44.117 --> 05:36:46.052
WE'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT. AND YOU

05:36:46.119 --> 05:36:47.120
CAN ADD ADDITIONAL TO THE AUTHOR

05:36:47.186 --> 05:36:49.455
DURING YOUR CLOTHES IF YOU WANT

05:36:49.522 --> 05:36:50.523
TO ADDRESS ANY OF THAT. OKAY, I

05:36:50.590 --> 05:36:52.392
SEE I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I'M

05:36:52.458 --> 05:36:54.227
DOING THE SCAN. ARE YOU SAYING

05:36:54.294 --> 05:36:55.395
HELLO TO ME BECAUSE YOU'RE MY

05:36:55.461 --> 05:36:57.897
GOOD FRIEND OR WOULD YOU LIKE TO

05:36:57.964 --> 05:36:59.666
COMMENT? OKAY. THANK YOU. ALL

05:36:59.732 --> 05:37:03.169
RIGHT, MOVING ON, MOVING ON. SO

05:37:03.236 --> 05:37:06.139
I WANT TO THANK YOU TO THE

05:37:06.205 --> 05:37:08.174
AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH THE

05:37:08.241 --> 05:37:11.144
COMMITTEE ON, YOU KNOW, AMENDS,

05:37:11.210 --> 05:37:13.279
ESPECIALLY THE TIERED APPROACH

05:37:13.346 --> 05:37:15.315
FOR FINES FOR REPEAT VIOLATION.

05:37:15.381 --> 05:37:16.416
THE CURRENT PENALTY FOR RUNNING

05:37:16.482 --> 05:37:19.085
A RED LIGHT IS $500 WITH A POINT

05:37:19.152 --> 05:37:20.320
ON YOUR LICENSE AFTER TWO POINTS

05:37:20.386 --> 05:37:21.621
ON A PERSON'S LICENSE, A

05:37:21.688 --> 05:37:23.089
PERSON'S INSURANCE RATE

05:37:23.156 --> 05:37:25.258
INCREASES BY 20%, AND AFTER FOUR

05:37:25.325 --> 05:37:26.993
POINTS, A PERSON'S LICENSE IS

05:37:27.060 --> 05:37:29.529
SUSPENDED. THERE'S A NATURAL

05:37:29.596 --> 05:37:30.229
WITHIN THE LAW. THERE'S A

05:37:30.296 --> 05:37:31.798
NATURAL INCLINATION TO INCREASE

05:37:31.864 --> 05:37:33.866
THE PENALTY SO THAT THE BEHAVIOR

05:37:33.933 --> 05:37:35.234
CAN CURB. SO I BELIEVE WITH THE

05:37:35.301 --> 05:37:37.070
TIERED APPROACH, IT ADDRESSES

05:37:37.136 --> 05:37:40.707
THAT TAKING IT FROM A CRIMINAL

05:37:40.773 --> 05:37:43.509
