PURPOSES. SO I KNOW, YOU KNOW,

00:44:25.062 --> 00:44:26.630
THERE'S A LOT OF NERVOUSNESS

00:44:26.697 --> 00:44:27.765
SOMETIMES. NO NEED TO BE

00:44:27.831 --> 00:44:29.266
NERVOUS. WE'RE JUST GOING TO

00:44:29.333 --> 00:44:30.968
HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT TOPICS

00:44:31.035 --> 00:44:33.203
THAT I THINK ARE TOP OF MIND AT

00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:34.238
THE MOMENT WITH EVERYTHING GOING

00:44:34.304 --> 00:44:35.939
ON. AND QUITE FRANKLY, OBVIOUSLY

00:44:36.006 --> 00:44:38.709
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HAS HAS NEVER

00:44:38.776 --> 00:44:41.745
GONE AWAY. WE JUST KEEP LOOKING

00:44:41.812 --> 00:44:43.414
OVER IT AND PRETENDING THAT WHAT

00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:45.582
WE'RE DOING IS, IS REALLY

00:44:45.649 --> 00:44:48.285
HELPING. AND SO WE'RE HERE TO

00:44:48.352 --> 00:44:51.121
TALK ABOUT ISSUES THAT WE CAN

00:44:51.188 --> 00:44:52.589
FIX, EVEN IF WE CAN'T FIX

00:44:52.656 --> 00:44:54.024
EVERYTHING AT ONCE, IF WE CAN

00:44:54.091 --> 00:44:55.659
MAKE BABY STEPS, I THINK AT SOME

00:44:55.726 --> 00:44:57.561
POINT WE'LL GET TO THE POINT

00:44:57.628 --> 00:45:00.064
WHERE WHERE WE WE'VE MADE SOME

00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:01.732
PROGRESS. AND, YOU KNOW, WE KNOW

00:45:01.799 --> 00:45:04.068
THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS

00:45:04.134 --> 00:45:05.602
PERVASIVE AND DEVASTATING. IT

00:45:05.669 --> 00:45:06.637
AFFECTS INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES

00:45:06.703 --> 00:45:09.139
AND FAMILIES ACROSS ACROSS

00:45:09.206 --> 00:45:10.541
COMMUNITIES, REGARDLESS OF AGE,

00:45:10.607 --> 00:45:13.077
RACE OR BACKGROUND. IT TAKES

00:45:13.143 --> 00:45:15.879
MANY FORMS PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL,

00:45:15.946 --> 00:45:17.347
PSYCHOLOGICAL AND FINANCIAL. AND

00:45:17.414 --> 00:45:20.684
ITS IMPACT IS LIFE LONG LASTING.

00:45:20.751 --> 00:45:22.086
THIS ISSUE IS PROFOUNDLY

00:45:22.152 --> 00:45:24.354
PERSONAL TO ME AS DOMESTIC

00:45:24.421 --> 00:45:26.156
VIOLENCE HAS IMPACTED MY FAMILY

00:45:26.223 --> 00:45:29.460
AND MYSELF. I'VE TALKED ABOUT

00:45:29.526 --> 00:45:33.363
THAT BEFORE, SO WE'LL MOVE ON TO

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:35.299
THE. THE REAL REASON FOR TODAY

00:45:35.365 --> 00:45:38.302
IS THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TEEN

00:45:38.368 --> 00:45:41.605
VIOLENCE, SPECIFICALLY IN MY

00:45:41.672 --> 00:45:43.440
DISTRICT. WE HAD A YOUNG WOMAN

00:45:43.507 --> 00:45:45.876
WAS MURDERED IN DECEMBER, A

00:45:45.943 --> 00:45:47.711
CHEERLEADER WAS MURDERED BY HER

00:45:47.778 --> 00:45:49.780
BOYFRIEND. IT WAS A DOMESTIC

00:45:49.847 --> 00:45:51.081
VIOLENCE ISSUE. SHE HAD BROKEN

00:45:51.148 --> 00:45:54.718
UP WITH HIM, BUT HE FOUND A WAY.

00:45:54.785 --> 00:45:56.086
PART OF THE DISCUSSIONS WE'VE

00:45:56.153 --> 00:45:58.689
HAD IN THE PAST IS ON ON

00:45:58.755 --> 00:46:00.290
RESTRAINING ORDERS. RESTRAINING

00:46:00.357 --> 00:46:01.225
ORDERS, WE THINK, FIX

00:46:01.291 --> 00:46:02.759
EVERYTHING. IT'S JUST A PIECE OF

00:46:02.826 --> 00:46:04.628
PAPER THAT DOESN'T STOP ANYBODY

00:46:04.695 --> 00:46:07.097
FROM DOING ANYTHING. IT'S JUST

00:46:07.164 --> 00:46:08.665
INDICATING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:46:08.732 --> 00:46:10.000
THAT THAT PERSON SHOULD NOT BE

00:46:10.067 --> 00:46:11.368
NEAR YOU. BUT IT DOESN'T STOP

00:46:11.435 --> 00:46:13.303
THE PERSON FROM ACTUALLY COMING

00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:14.838
AFTER YOU. AND IT WAS REALLY A

00:46:14.905 --> 00:46:17.508
SAD AND TRAGIC SITUATION IN THE

00:46:17.574 --> 00:46:19.676
CITY OF AZUSA. IT'S A, A UNIFIED

00:46:19.743 --> 00:46:22.579
SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND THE PURPOSE

00:46:22.646 --> 00:46:24.047
AGAIN FOR TODAY'S MEETING IS I

00:46:24.114 --> 00:46:28.051
WANT TO TALK ABOUT TEEN TEEN

00:46:28.118 --> 00:46:30.053
VIOLENCE AND HEALTHY

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:32.322
RELATIONSHIPS. WE WANT TO BRING

00:46:32.389 --> 00:46:34.791
AWARENESS TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

00:46:34.858 --> 00:46:36.593
IN ALL AREAS. BUT AGAIN, THE

00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:38.328
FOCUS FOR TODAY'S MEETING WILL

00:46:38.395 --> 00:46:40.631
BE ON ON TEENS AND YOUNG ADULTS

00:46:40.697 --> 00:46:42.032
AND HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS AND

00:46:42.099 --> 00:46:44.168
HOW TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THOSE.

00:46:44.234 --> 00:46:46.036
WE ALL KNOW THAT MANY SURVIVORS

00:46:46.103 --> 00:46:47.738
SUFFER IN SILENCE. THEY'RE

00:46:47.804 --> 00:46:49.573
TRAPPED BY FEAR, STIGMA, OR LACK

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:51.375
OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT AVAILABLE

00:46:51.441 --> 00:46:53.343
SUPPORT. BY RAISING AWARENESS,

00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:54.745
WE EDUCATE OUR COMMUNITIES ABOUT

00:46:54.811 --> 00:46:56.647
THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF DOMESTIC

00:46:56.713 --> 00:46:58.949
VIOLENCE. IT'S INTERESTING. I'M

00:46:59.016 --> 00:47:02.519
A TEACHER AND WELL, I GUESS ONCE

00:47:02.586 --> 00:47:04.288
A TEACHER, ALWAYS A TEACHER, AND

00:47:04.354 --> 00:47:06.456
I HAD A SITUATION. I TAUGHT

00:47:06.523 --> 00:47:08.292
FOURTH GRADE AND THE YOUNG BOY

00:47:08.358 --> 00:47:10.294
WAS LAYING ON HIS DESK AND I'M

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:11.662
THINKING, OKAY, WHAT ARE YOU

00:47:11.728 --> 00:47:13.463
DOING? IT'S EARLY IN THE MORNING

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:15.465
AND I'M LIKE, WAKE UP, WAKE UP.

00:47:15.532 --> 00:47:16.800
HE'S ALL LIKE, OH, MISS RUBIO,

00:47:16.867 --> 00:47:17.768
IT'S BECAUSE MY DAD WAS WAS

00:47:17.834 --> 00:47:19.403
CHASING MY MOM IN THE BATHROOM

00:47:19.469 --> 00:47:21.805
AND HITTING HER, AND I COULDN'T

00:47:21.872 --> 00:47:23.040
SLEEP. HE SAID IT SO MATTER OF

00:47:23.106 --> 00:47:24.875
FACT THAT IT'S JUST PART OF WHAT

00:47:24.942 --> 00:47:26.743
HE YOU KNOW, WHAT HE SEES ALL

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:28.645
THE TIME. AND SO HE WAS LIKE,

00:47:28.712 --> 00:47:29.446
BASICALLY, LET ME GO BACK TO

00:47:29.513 --> 00:47:31.181
SLEEP. I'M TIRED AS OPPOSED TO,

00:47:31.248 --> 00:47:32.349
YOU KNOW, REALLY UNDERSTANDING

00:47:32.416 --> 00:47:34.251
WHAT WAS HAPPENING. AND HE WAS

00:47:34.318 --> 00:47:35.953
EIGHT YEARS OLD. SO I CAN ONLY

00:47:36.019 --> 00:47:37.854
IMAGINE IF HE THOUGHT IT WAS A

00:47:37.921 --> 00:47:39.356
NORMAL PART OF WHAT WAS

00:47:39.423 --> 00:47:42.426
HAPPENING. I HOPE MY AND I PRAY

00:47:42.492 --> 00:47:44.995
THAT SOMEHOW THE FAMILY GOT SOME

00:47:45.062 --> 00:47:47.931
HELP, BUT UNLESS WE ACTIVELY

00:47:47.998 --> 00:47:49.967
GUIDE THEM OR TALK ABOUT WHAT'S

00:47:50.033 --> 00:47:51.868
HAPPENING, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT

00:47:51.935 --> 00:47:53.303
FAMILY HAS EVER GOTTEN HELP. AND

00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:56.240
IT IT DOES HAUNT ME. I TRIED TO

00:47:56.306 --> 00:47:57.975
BE POSITIVE AND THINK THAT WE'RE

00:47:58.041 --> 00:48:00.544
DOING A LOT TO ERADICATE

00:48:00.611 --> 00:48:02.145
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, OR TO AT

00:48:02.212 --> 00:48:03.747
LEAST HIGHLIGHT THE RESOURCES

00:48:03.814 --> 00:48:05.582
AVAILABLE TO FAMILIES. BUT THE

00:48:05.649 --> 00:48:07.084
REALITY IS THAT, YOU KNOW, ONCE

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:08.819
IF WE CAN HELP ONE PERSON,

00:48:08.885 --> 00:48:10.787
THERE'S TWO OR 3 OR 4 OR MORE

00:48:10.854 --> 00:48:11.822
OTHERS THAT ARE BEING ABUSED AT

00:48:11.888 --> 00:48:14.891
THE MOMENT. SO I REALLY DO LOOK

00:48:14.958 --> 00:48:16.393
FORWARD TO HEARING FROM OUR

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:17.761
EXPERT ADVOCATES AS THEY SHARE

00:48:17.828 --> 00:48:20.330
VALUABLE, VALUABLE INSIGHTS AND

00:48:20.397 --> 00:48:24.167
RESOURCES. AND LET'S SEE. AND I

00:48:24.234 --> 00:48:25.736
INTRODUCED OUR ASSEMBLY MEMBERS

00:48:25.802 --> 00:48:28.272
AND OUR OUR FIRST PANEL IS ON

00:48:28.338 --> 00:48:30.407
TEEN DATING. THE FIRST PANEL

00:48:30.474 --> 00:48:31.908
WILL FOCUS ON TEEN DATING

00:48:31.975 --> 00:48:33.543
VIOLENCE AND ISSUES SURROUNDING

00:48:33.610 --> 00:48:35.012
SURROUNDING IT. THEY WILL COVER

00:48:35.078 --> 00:48:36.446
TOPICS SUCH AS WARNING SIGNS OF

00:48:36.513 --> 00:48:37.814
ABUSE, THE IMPACTS OF

00:48:37.881 --> 00:48:39.283
TECHNOLOGY. AND WE ALL KNOW

00:48:39.349 --> 00:48:42.619
TECHNOLOGY IS A MAJOR CULPRIT IN

00:48:42.686 --> 00:48:43.887
WHAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH NOW,

00:48:43.954 --> 00:48:46.823
NOT JUST IN ABUSE, BUT ALSO

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:48.525
DEPRESSION AND MENTAL HEALTH

00:48:48.592 --> 00:48:50.527
ISSUES WITH WITH TEENS BECAUSE

00:48:50.594 --> 00:48:56.066
OF IT. BUT WE WANT TO HIGHLIGHT

00:48:56.133 --> 00:48:58.302
SOME OF THE RESOURCES THAT OR

00:48:58.368 --> 00:49:00.437
IDEAS THAT WE CAN SUGGEST SO

00:49:00.504 --> 00:49:03.740
THAT FAMILIES AND TEACHERS AND

00:49:03.807 --> 00:49:05.976
JUST NEIGHBORS CAN USE TO TRY

00:49:06.043 --> 00:49:07.744
AND HELP THESE, THESE VICTIMS.

00:49:07.811 --> 00:49:09.613

JENNICA, IF YOU IF YOU WILL.

00:49:56.593 --> 00:49:57.761
GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU FOR

00:49:57.828 --> 00:50:00.263
HAVING US HERE TODAY TO TALK

00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:02.032
ABOUT THIS VERY IMPORTANT

00:50:02.099 --> 00:50:04.234
CONVERSATION. YOU KNOW, WHEN

00:50:04.301 --> 00:50:06.370
WORKING WITH TEENS, PART OF WHAT

00:50:06.436 --> 00:50:08.905
I'M DOING RIGHT NOW IS GOING OUT

00:50:08.972 --> 00:50:10.674
INTO THE HIGH SCHOOLS AND JUNIOR

00:50:10.741 --> 00:50:12.342
HIGHS AND PROVIDING EDUCATION ON

00:50:12.409 --> 00:50:14.244
WHAT A HEALTHY AND UNHEALTHY

00:50:14.311 --> 00:50:17.481
RELATIONSHIP IS. SO MANY TIMES,

00:50:17.547 --> 00:50:18.648
CHILDREN THAT HAVE COME FROM

00:50:18.715 --> 00:50:20.350
HOMES WHERE THEY'VE WITNESSED

00:50:20.417 --> 00:50:21.551
VIOLENCE, IT IS VERY EASY FOR

00:50:21.618 --> 00:50:23.987
THEM TO KIND OF LET THOSE LITTLE

00:50:24.054 --> 00:50:25.822
RED FLAGS GO, BECAUSE IT'S VERY

00:50:25.889 --> 00:50:27.591
NORMAL IN THEIR HOME TO SEE

00:50:27.657 --> 00:50:29.693
FIGHTING, YELLING, SCREAMING.

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.561
AND THEN AS THEY START

00:50:31.628 --> 00:50:32.129
DEVELOPING RELATIONSHIPS IN

00:50:32.195 --> 00:50:34.398
THOSE VERY EARLY AGES, LIKE 12,

00:50:34.464 --> 00:50:36.900
13, EVEN FRIENDSHIPS, THEY DON'T

00:50:36.967 --> 00:50:38.402
REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT A HEALTHY

00:50:38.468 --> 00:50:40.504
RELATIONSHIP LOOKS LIKE. AND SO

00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:43.073
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:44.908
DIFFERENT TYPES OF SIGNS THAT

00:50:44.975 --> 00:50:47.444
WE'RE SEEING, ESPECIALLY WITH

00:50:47.511 --> 00:50:49.446
TECHNOLOGY AND SOME OF THE

00:50:49.513 --> 00:50:50.247
THINGS THAT I'M KIND OF

00:50:50.313 --> 00:50:51.948
ENCOUNTERING, WHICH I'M SURE YOU

00:50:52.015 --> 00:50:53.316
ARE AS WELL, IS THE BIGGEST

00:50:53.383 --> 00:50:54.484
THING RIGHT NOW. WHAT I'M SEEING

00:50:54.551 --> 00:50:56.052
WITH, LIKE, SOME OF OUR HIGH

00:50:56.119 --> 00:50:58.688
SCHOOL STUDENTS IS BEING ABLE TO

00:50:58.755 --> 00:51:00.357
BUY SOMEBODY A PHONE LIKE, HEY,

I GOT YOU THIS PHONE FOR YOUR

00:51:02.159 --> 00:51:03.894
BIRTHDAY OR FOR A GIFT, BUT IT'S

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:06.296
A WAY TO HAVE TRACKING DEVICES.

00:51:06.363 --> 00:51:08.665
IT'S A WAY TO PUT APPS ON THEIR

00:51:08.732 --> 00:51:10.500
PHONES, TO BE ABLE TO SHARE

00:51:10.567 --> 00:51:15.138
THEIR TEXT MESSAGES. IT'S A WAY

00:51:15.205 --> 00:51:16.406
TO KIND OF HAVE CONTACT IN

00:51:16.473 --> 00:51:17.774
EVERYTHING THAT THEY'RE DOING.

00:51:17.841 --> 00:51:19.176
SO SEEING WHO THEY FRIEND ON

00:51:19.242 --> 00:51:20.777
THEIR INSTAGRAM, HAVING THEIR

00:51:20.844 --> 00:51:22.679
PASSWORDS, SEEING IF THEY LIKE

00:51:22.746 --> 00:51:25.215
SOMEBODY ELSE'S STORY, BEING

00:51:25.282 --> 00:51:27.284
ABLE TO REALLY MONITOR HOW MUCH

00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:29.586
TIME THEIR PARTNER IS USING ON

00:51:29.653 --> 00:51:31.521
SOCIAL MEDIA, AND THEN BEING

00:51:31.588 --> 00:51:32.722
ABLE TO SEE EVERYTHING BECAUSE

00:51:32.789 --> 00:51:34.124
THEY'VE BOUGHT THIS PHONE THAT

00:51:34.191 --> 00:51:35.759
NOW THEY HAVE ACCESS TO BECAUSE

00:51:35.826 --> 00:51:36.593
THEY'VE PAID FOR IT. WELL, I

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:38.528
BOUGHT YOU THAT PHONE AS A GIFT,

00:51:38.595 --> 00:51:41.198
BUT IT'S A WAY OF HAVING THAT

00:51:41.264 --> 00:51:41.765
CONTROL. SO THAT'S SOMETHING

00:51:41.832 --> 00:51:43.567
THAT I'M SEEING A LOT MORE. AND

00:51:43.633 --> 00:51:44.835
ALSO JUST WITH FOOD, YOU KNOW,

00:51:44.901 --> 00:51:46.536
WITH HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND

00:51:46.603 --> 00:51:47.904
JUNIOR HIGH, LIKE WHEN YOU GET

00:51:47.971 --> 00:51:49.473
FOOD BECAUSE NOW THERE'S UBER

00:51:49.539 --> 00:51:51.241
EATS AND ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT

00:51:51.308 --> 00:51:52.943
WAYS. SO SOMETIMES I'LL SEE AT

00:51:53.009 --> 00:51:55.045
SCHOOLS. OH, MY PARTNER SENT ME

00:51:55.111 --> 00:51:57.280
LUNCH TODAY AND TOMORROW. AND

00:51:57.347 --> 00:51:58.648
EVERY DAY THEY'RE GETTING LUNCH

00:51:58.715 --> 00:51:59.816
DELIVERED. LIKE IT'S REALLY

00:51:59.883 --> 00:52:01.184
EXCITING WHEN YOU'RE 14, 15

00:52:01.251 --> 00:52:03.353
YEARS OLD TO HAVE MCDONALD'S AND

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:05.355
CHICK FIL A GETTING DELIVERED TO

00:52:05.422 --> 00:52:07.324
SCHOOL. BUT THEN SOME DAYS I'LL

00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:09.359
SEE NO FOOD AND I'M LIKE, HEY,

00:52:09.426 --> 00:52:10.694
WHAT'S GOING ON? OH, WE GOT IN A

00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:12.629
FIGHT, SO I DON'T GET LUNCH

00:52:12.696 --> 00:52:13.763
TODAY OR, YOU KNOW, DIFFERENT

00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:15.732
WAYS THAT THEY'RE USING THINGS

00:52:15.799 --> 00:52:17.701
THAT NOW THEY HAVE ACCESS TO ON

00:52:17.767 --> 00:52:19.603
THEIR PHONES TO BE ABLE TO HAVE

00:52:19.669 --> 00:52:22.839
THAT CONTROL. I HAVE A STUDENTS

00:52:22.906 --> 00:52:24.541
THAT I SEE THAT COME TO SCHOOL

00:52:24.608 --> 00:52:26.343
WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT, THEIR

00:52:26.409 --> 00:52:28.945
NAILS DONE, OR BAGS, MAKEUP,

00:52:29.012 --> 00:52:30.580
EYELASHES. AND IT'S THINGS THAT

00:52:30.647 --> 00:52:32.682
THEIR PARTNERS HAVE BOUGHT THEM,

00:52:32.749 --> 00:52:33.750
BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE THINGS

00:52:33.817 --> 00:52:35.218
THAT ARE EXCITING FOR TEENS

00:52:35.285 --> 00:52:37.254
RIGHT NOW. AND THEN BEING ABLE

00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:39.422
TO TAKE ALL OF THOSE THINGS

00:52:39.489 --> 00:52:40.724
AWAY. RIGHT. AND SO I SEE THOSE

00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:42.592
KINDS OF THINGS BEING USED A LOT

00:52:42.659 --> 00:52:43.693
MORE, BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE A LOT

00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:45.495
OF WAYS TO ACCESS THAT. BY

00:52:45.562 --> 00:52:47.364
BUYING THINGS ON AMAZON, HAVING

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.998
THEM DELIVERED, HAVING LITTLE

00:52:48.064 --> 00:52:49.533
GIFTS DELIVERED. AND I'M SEEING

00:52:49.599 --> 00:52:51.501
THAT SO MUCH MORE WITH MY HIGH

00:52:51.568 --> 00:52:53.436
SCHOOL STUDENTS THAT I WORK WITH,

00:52:53.503 --> 00:52:54.905
AS THAT BEING DIFFERENT FORMS

00:52:54.971 --> 00:52:57.040
THAT WE NEVER REALLY WERE ABLE

00:52:57.107 --> 00:53:00.143
TO SEE EARLIER ON. ALSO, JUST,

00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:03.113
YOU KNOW, WITH TEENS WHEN

00:53:03.179 --> 00:53:05.248
THEY'RE IN SCHOOL. SO ONE OUT OF

00:53:05.315 --> 00:53:06.650
SEVEN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS

00:53:06.716 --> 00:53:08.451
EXPERIENCES AN ABUSIVE

00:53:08.518 --> 00:53:10.687
RELATIONSHIP, AND MORE THAN HALF

00:53:10.754 --> 00:53:12.856
OF THEM NEVER LET THEIR PARENTS

00:53:12.923 --> 00:53:14.658
KNOW BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT

00:53:14.724 --> 00:53:15.659
THEIR PARENTS TO TELL THEM, YOU

00:53:15.725 --> 00:53:17.561
CAN'T BE WITH THIS PERSON WHEN

00:53:17.627 --> 00:53:18.995
YOU'RE A TEEN. THAT PERSON MEANS

00:53:19.062 --> 00:53:20.864
EVERYTHING TO YOU, RIGHT? AND SO

00:53:20.931 --> 00:53:21.965
HAVING OTHER FAMILY OR FRIENDS

00:53:22.032 --> 00:53:23.166
TELL THEM LIKE, THIS ISN'T

00:53:23.233 --> 00:53:24.801
SOMEBODY THAT YOU SHOULD BE

00:53:24.868 --> 00:53:26.002
WITH. THEY DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO

00:53:26.069 --> 00:53:27.571
KNOW THAT. AND WHEN IN TALKING

00:53:27.637 --> 00:53:29.339
TO PARENTS AND WHEN I'M DOING

00:53:29.406 --> 00:53:30.540
EDUCATION, MANY PARENTS WILL

00:53:30.607 --> 00:53:32.342
TELL ME LIKE, OH, I COULD

00:53:32.409 --> 00:53:33.910
IDENTIFY. I WOULD KNOW FOR SURE

00:53:33.977 --> 00:53:35.211
IF MY CHILD WAS IN AN ABUSIVE

00:53:35.278 --> 00:53:36.880
AND NONE OF THEM KNEW THAT THEIR

00:53:36.947 --> 00:53:37.747
CHILDREN WERE IN ABUSIVE

00:53:37.814 --> 00:53:39.482
RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE THE KIDS

00:53:39.549 --> 00:53:40.817
DIDN'T WANT THEIR PARENTS TO

00:53:40.884 --> 00:53:41.518
KNOW BECAUSE THEY KNEW THEY

00:53:41.585 --> 00:53:42.519
WOULD BE LIMITED. THEN ON WHAT

00:53:42.586 --> 00:53:45.655
THEY WERE ABLE TO DO WITH THAT

00:53:45.722 --> 00:53:46.256
PERSON, THAT THEY THINK THAT

00:53:46.323 --> 00:53:47.490
THEY'RE IN LOVE WITH, AND THAT

00:53:47.557 --> 00:53:48.892
PERSON REALLY TAKING ALL OF

00:53:48.959 --> 00:53:50.927
THEIR TIME. SO I SEE THEM COME

00:53:50.994 --> 00:53:51.928
TO SCHOOL IN THE MORNINGS,

00:53:51.995 --> 00:53:53.263
THEY'RE TEXTING ALL THE WAY TO

00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:54.931
SCHOOL, THEY GET OUT OF CLASS,

00:53:54.998 --> 00:53:55.999
THEN THEY MEET RIGHT AFTER

00:53:56.066 --> 00:53:57.100
CLASS, THEN THEY HAVE LUNCH

00:53:57.167 --> 00:53:58.435
TOGETHER. THEN THEY HAVE BREAK

00:53:58.501 --> 00:54:00.337
TOGETHER. THEN THEY, YOU KNOW,

00:54:00.403 --> 00:54:02.305
WALK TO THE NEXT CLASS TOGETHER.

00:54:02.372 --> 00:54:03.473
THEN AFTER SCHOOL, THEY'RE

00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:05.275
TEXTING UNTIL THEY GET HOME, AND

00:54:05.342 --> 00:54:06.776
THEN THEY'RE CALLING AND THEY'RE

00:54:06.843 --> 00:54:08.144
FACETIMING. AND LET ME SEE WHERE

00:54:08.211 --> 00:54:09.679
YOU'RE AT. WELL, SEND ME A

00:54:09.746 --> 00:54:10.513
PICTURE WHERE YOU'RE AT. WELL,

00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:12.682
WHO ELSE IS THERE? WELL, I

00:54:12.749 --> 00:54:13.383
DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE WEARING

00:54:13.450 --> 00:54:15.352
THAT. HOW COME YOU'RE WEARING

00:54:15.418 --> 00:54:16.987
THAT? WHO ELSE IS GOING TO BE AT

00:54:17.053 --> 00:54:18.188
THIS PARTY? SO IT'S LIKE WITH

00:54:18.254 --> 00:54:19.456
THE PHONE TO BEING ABLE TO

00:54:19.522 --> 00:54:21.925
CONSTANTLY HAVE ACCESS. AND I

00:54:21.992 --> 00:54:23.293
SEE THAT A LOT WITH THE KIDS AS

00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:23.893
THEY FEEL LIKE THAT PERSON.

00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:26.196
THEIR WHOLE WORLD REVOLVES

00:54:26.262 --> 00:54:26.730
AROUND THEM. THAT LACK OF

00:54:26.796 --> 00:54:28.098
INDEPENDENCE AND BEING ABLE TO

00:54:28.164 --> 00:54:29.432
LIKE, NO, TODAY I WANT TO HAVE

00:54:29.499 --> 00:54:30.700
LUNCH WITH MY FRIENDS AND TODAY

00:54:30.767 --> 00:54:32.902
I'M GOING TO GO HANG OUT. YOU

00:54:32.969 --> 00:54:34.304
KNOW, AFTER SCHOOL, IT'S NOT

00:54:34.371 --> 00:54:34.938
REALLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT THOSE

00:54:35.005 --> 00:54:36.339
HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS LOOK LIKE,

00:54:36.406 --> 00:54:36.940
BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT

00:54:37.007 --> 00:54:38.541
THAT INDEPENDENCE MEANS AND HOW

00:54:38.608 --> 00:54:39.909
IMPORTANT IT IS TO BE

00:54:39.976 --> 00:54:41.044
INDEPENDENT WHEN YOU'RE, YOU

00:54:41.111 --> 00:54:42.545
KNOW, GROWING UP AND BEING ABLE

00:54:42.612 --> 00:54:44.948
TO HAVE YOUR OWN SET OF FRIENDS

00:54:45.015 --> 00:54:46.449
AND IT'S OKAY TO HAVE FRIENDS OF

00:54:46.516 --> 00:54:48.385
THE OPPOSITE SEX, BECAUSE WHEN I

00:54:48.451 --> 00:54:48.952
TALK TO KIDS, THEY'RE LIKE,

00:54:49.019 --> 00:54:49.753
NOPE, THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE

00:54:49.819 --> 00:54:51.621
RULE. NOPE. THEY CAN'T HAVE

00:54:51.688 --> 00:54:52.822
FRIENDS THAT ARE GIRLS AND THEY

00:54:52.889 --> 00:54:54.257
CAN'T HAVE FRIENDS THAT ARE

00:54:54.324 --> 00:54:55.692
GUYS. AND I'M LIKE, NO, THAT'S

00:54:55.759 --> 00:54:58.061
THAT'S IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO

00:54:58.128 --> 00:54:59.095
HAVE THAT, TO DEVELOP AND GROW

00:54:59.162 --> 00:55:00.764
AND UNDERSTAND. BUT MANY TIMES

00:55:00.830 --> 00:55:02.265
WHEN I'M WORKING WITH YOUTH, I

00:55:02.332 --> 00:55:03.767
SEE THAT THESE ARE THINGS THAT

00:55:03.833 --> 00:55:05.301
THEY THINK ARE KIND OF COOL.

00:55:05.368 --> 00:55:06.836
AGAIN, A LOT OF TIMES BECAUSE OF

00:55:06.903 --> 00:55:08.605
WHAT THEY'RE SEEING ON SOCIAL

00:55:08.672 --> 00:55:11.374
MEDIA THAT THESE IT'S IMPORTANT

00:55:11.441 --> 00:55:13.443
TO BE JEALOUS. SO WHEN I ASK THE

00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:15.578
KIDS WHAT DO YOU WANT? THEY'RE

00:55:15.645 --> 00:55:16.413
LIKE, WELL, THEY HAVE TO BE

00:55:16.479 --> 00:55:17.580
JEALOUS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT

00:55:17.647 --> 00:55:19.883
TELLS ME THEY LIKE ME. NO,

00:55:19.949 --> 00:55:20.784
THAT'S NOT. BUT THEY HAVE THIS

00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:21.718
MISCONCEPTION BECAUSE OF WHAT'S

00:55:21.785 --> 00:55:23.153
SHOWN IN TIKTOK VIDEOS AND

00:55:23.219 --> 00:55:24.054
DIFFERENT THINGS THAT THEY

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:26.790
WATCH, THAT TV SHOWS AND MUSIC

00:55:26.856 --> 00:55:29.125
THAT THEY HEAR, THAT THIS IS

00:55:29.192 --> 00:55:29.993
WHAT IS NORMALIZED. AND SO THEY

00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:31.161
THINK THAT THIS IS WHAT

00:55:31.227 --> 00:55:31.895
RELATIONSHIPS ARE SUPPOSED TO

00:55:31.961 --> 00:55:34.297
LOOK LIKE. AND SO REALLY TRYING

00:55:34.364 --> 00:55:36.066
TO HELP THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT

00:55:36.132 --> 00:55:37.734
THERE'S TRUST IN RELATIONSHIPS,

00:55:37.801 --> 00:55:39.002
THERE'S HONESTY IN

00:55:39.069 --> 00:55:39.703
RELATIONSHIPS, AND REALLY

00:55:39.769 --> 00:55:41.538
HELPING THEM TO SEE WHAT THAT

00:55:41.604 --> 00:55:42.872
LOOKS LIKE, BECAUSE MANY KIDS

00:55:42.939 --> 00:55:44.874
HAVE NEVER HAD THOSE EXAMPLES OF

00:55:44.941 --> 00:55:47.243
WHAT THAT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE,

00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:49.079
THEY MAY HAVE ONLY SEEN

00:55:49.145 --> 00:55:50.447
UNHEALTHY. AND SO THEY JUST KIND

00:55:50.513 --> 00:55:52.449
OF ARE FOLLOWING AND WHAT THEY

00:55:52.515 --> 00:55:54.184
THINK IS NORMAL. AND WHAT IS A

00:55:54.250 --> 00:55:55.985
LEARNED BEHAVIOR. SO I THINK

00:55:56.052 --> 00:55:57.420
SOME OF THE RESOURCES THAT WE

00:55:57.487 --> 00:55:58.688
REALLY TRY TO INCORPORATE IS

00:55:58.755 --> 00:56:01.324
TEACHING THOSE RED FLAGS,

00:56:01.391 --> 00:56:03.560
BECAUSE MANY TIMES I ALWAYS SAY

00:56:03.626 --> 00:56:04.661
THAT PEOPLE WEAR THESE LITTLE

00:56:04.728 --> 00:56:05.995
LOVE BLINDERS, SUNGLASSES, AND

00:56:06.062 --> 00:56:09.099
THOSE RED FLAGS ARE THERE FROM

00:56:09.165 --> 00:56:09.766
THE BEGINNING, BUT THOSE LITTLE

00:56:09.833 --> 00:56:10.633
GLASSES ARE ON AND YOU'RE LIKE,

00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:11.801
OH, THIS PERSON IS GREAT, AND

00:56:11.868 --> 00:56:13.136
THEY LOOK AMAZING AND

00:56:13.203 --> 00:56:13.837
EVERYTHING'S THERE. THEY'RE

00:56:13.903 --> 00:56:15.605
POPULAR AND THEY'RE, YOU KNOW,

00:56:15.672 --> 00:56:17.774
THEY'RE THE, YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW,

00:56:17.841 --> 00:56:19.342
GETTING GREAT GRADES. AND

00:56:19.409 --> 00:56:21.144
EVERYBODY LIKES THIS PERSON. AND

00:56:21.211 --> 00:56:22.545
THOSE RED FLAGS ARE THERE FROM

00:56:22.612 --> 00:56:23.646
THE BEGINNING, BUT THEY HAVE

00:56:23.713 --> 00:56:24.581
THOSE LITTLE SUNGLASSES ON.

00:56:24.647 --> 00:56:25.882
THEY'RE JUST KIND OF BRUSHING

00:56:25.949 --> 00:56:27.484
THOSE RED FLAGS AWAY. BUT MANY

00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:28.785
TIMES FRIENDS AND FAMILY AREN'T

00:56:28.852 --> 00:56:29.686
WEARING THOSE. AND THEY CAN SEE

00:56:29.753 --> 00:56:35.325
THOSE RED FLAGS. MAY I JUST

00:56:35.391 --> 00:56:36.659
BECAUSE IT POPPED INTO MY HEAD I

00:56:36.726 --> 00:56:39.529
HAVE TEEN TEENAGERS. I HAVE AN

00:56:39.596 --> 00:56:41.598
18 YEAR OLD NOW AND A 17 YEAR

00:56:41.664 --> 00:56:43.566
OLD, AND MY SON WAS IN A

00:56:43.633 --> 00:56:46.002
RELATIONSHIP AND I SAW THE

00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:48.838
SIGNS, BUT I WAS LIKE, MAYBE

00:56:48.905 --> 00:56:50.774
IT'S JUST ME. MAYBE IT'S JUST,

00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:52.275
YOU KNOW, I'M BEING TOO

00:56:52.342 --> 00:56:53.476
JUDGMENTAL, YOU KNOW, JUST ALL

00:56:53.543 --> 00:56:56.112
OF THESE THINGS AS A PARENT, YOU

00:56:56.179 --> 00:56:59.082
KNOW, I KEPT SAYING, I DON'T

00:56:59.149 --> 00:57:01.017
KNOW AND BRUSHED IT OFF. I

00:57:01.084 --> 00:57:02.152
BRUSHED IT OFF BECAUSE I'M

00:57:02.218 --> 00:57:05.488
THINKING IT'S JUST ME TRYING TO

00:57:05.555 --> 00:57:06.589
JUSTIFY THAT SOMETHING, YOU

00:57:06.656 --> 00:57:09.159
KNOW? AND IT WASN'T OBVIOUS.

00:57:09.225 --> 00:57:10.059
IT'S MY SON, BUT IT WASN'T, YOU

00:57:10.126 --> 00:57:11.528
KNOW, AN OBVIOUS. IT WAS JUST

00:57:11.594 --> 00:57:12.962
LIKE CONSTANTLY ON THE PHONE,

00:57:13.029 --> 00:57:14.731
CONSTANTLY HAVING TO CHECK IN.

00:57:14.798 --> 00:57:18.268
WE WERE ON VACATION AND

00:57:18.334 --> 00:57:21.171
APPARENTLY SHE STARTED BLOWING

00:57:21.237 --> 00:57:23.006
UP MY, MY DAUGHTER'S PHONE

00:57:23.072 --> 00:57:25.041
BECAUSE MY SON WOULDN'T ANSWER.

00:57:25.108 --> 00:57:27.710
AND HE HE CALLED HER BACK AND I

00:57:27.777 --> 00:57:29.212
HAPPENED TO HEAR THE

00:57:29.279 --> 00:57:30.647
CONVERSATION. AND HE'S LIKE,

00:57:30.713 --> 00:57:32.048
WELL, I TOLD YOU THAT, YOU KNOW,

00:57:32.115 --> 00:57:34.884
MY PHONE. I HAD TO LEAVE MY

00:57:34.951 --> 00:57:35.885
PHONE IN THE ROOM TO CHARGE. AND

00:57:35.952 --> 00:57:38.454
SHE SAYS, BUT I TOLD YOU THAT IF

00:57:38.521 --> 00:57:40.623
YOU'RE GOING TO LEAVE, MAKE SURE

00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:42.892
YOU CHARGE IT SO THAT I'M ALWAYS

00:57:42.959 --> 00:57:44.694
ABLE TO CONTACT YOU. AND I WAS

00:57:44.761 --> 00:57:46.429
LIKE THIS. IT DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT.

00:57:46.496 --> 00:57:47.931
BUT AGAIN, AS A PARENT. SO I

00:57:47.997 --> 00:57:49.666
KNOW THE RESOURCES ARE FOR THE

00:57:49.732 --> 00:57:51.534
TEENS, RIGHT? BUT AS A PARENT, I

00:57:51.601 --> 00:57:53.670
WAS LIKE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO

00:57:53.736 --> 00:57:56.773
DO. AND SO IT TOOK A WHILE.

00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:58.074
LITERALLY LIKE 5 OR 6 MONTHS

00:57:58.141 --> 00:57:59.475
BEFORE I WAS LIKE, WE HAVE TO

00:57:59.542 --> 00:58:01.811
HAVE A CONVERSATION. BUT A LOT

00:58:01.878 --> 00:58:04.414
OF THE DAMAGE TO HIM JUST

00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:06.149
FEELING BAD ABOUT HIMSELF WAS

00:58:06.216 --> 00:58:08.351
ALREADY HAPPENING. AND SO IF YOU

00:58:08.418 --> 00:58:10.186
CAN TALK ABOUT ANY SUGGESTIONS

00:58:10.253 --> 00:58:12.789
FOR PARENTS AS WELL, BECAUSE I'M

00:58:12.856 --> 00:58:13.723
SUPPOSEDLY, YOU KNOW, I'M

00:58:13.790 --> 00:58:15.258
ASSEMBLY MEMBER, I HAVE ALL THE

00:58:15.325 --> 00:58:16.326
RESOURCES IN THE WORLD AND I

00:58:16.392 --> 00:58:18.061
KNOW I HAVE BEEN, YOU KNOW,

00:58:18.127 --> 00:58:19.596
CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR SIX

00:58:19.662 --> 00:58:22.165
YEARS. SO YOU WOULD ASSUME THAT

00:58:22.232 --> 00:58:22.799
AT LEAST I WOULD KNOW THE FIRST

00:58:22.866 --> 00:58:24.734
THING AND I DIDN'T. SO IF YOU

00:58:24.801 --> 00:58:27.136
CAN TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE

00:58:27.203 --> 00:58:29.339
THINGS THAT PARENTS CAN LOOK FOR

00:58:29.405 --> 00:58:31.875
OR WHAT WE CAN DO. WELL, I THINK

00:58:31.941 --> 00:58:32.942
YOU BROUGHT UP A PERFECT

00:58:33.009 --> 00:58:34.644
EXAMPLE, RIGHT? IT WAS THINGS

00:58:34.711 --> 00:58:35.712
THAT YOU NOTICED, BUT THEN YOU

00:58:35.778 --> 00:58:37.914
KIND OF WERE LIKE, OH, MAYBE

00:58:37.981 --> 00:58:39.549
NOT, MAYBE NOT. AND I THINK THAT

00:58:39.616 --> 00:58:41.284
THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE

00:58:41.351 --> 00:58:43.152
WANT PEOPLE TO LOOK AT. SO WHEN

00:58:43.219 --> 00:58:44.587
WE DO TALK TO THOSE FRIENDS AND

00:58:44.654 --> 00:58:46.222
FAMILY, WE WANT THEM TO SEE AND

00:58:46.289 --> 00:58:48.458
KNOW WHAT ARE WHAT IS A HEALTHY

00:58:48.524 --> 00:58:49.359
RELATIONSHIP SO THAT THEY CAN

00:58:49.425 --> 00:58:50.593
HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH THAT

00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:52.295
PERSON WHO MAY BE IN AN

00:58:52.362 --> 00:58:52.896
UNHEALTHY RELATIONSHIP, LIKE

00:58:52.962 --> 00:58:54.530
SAY, HEY, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE

00:58:54.597 --> 00:58:57.000
IN A RELATIONSHIP, IT'S OKAY FOR

00:58:57.066 --> 00:58:59.502
YOU TO NOT HAVE TO RESPOND

00:58:59.569 --> 00:59:00.770
IMMEDIATELY. IT'S OKAY FOR YOU

00:59:00.837 --> 00:59:03.172
TO BE ABLE TO HAVE TIME WITH

00:59:03.239 --> 00:59:04.741
YOUR FAMILY AND BE ABLE TO DO

00:59:04.807 --> 00:59:06.009
THINGS, AND THAT PERSON SHOULD

00:59:06.075 --> 00:59:07.510
BE SUPPORTIVE, YOU KNOW, HAVING

00:59:07.577 --> 00:59:08.578
THOSE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT

00:59:08.645 --> 00:59:10.013
DOES THAT LOOK LIKE? IT'S

00:59:10.079 --> 00:59:11.281
IMPORTANT TO HAVE SOMEBODY WHO

00:59:11.347 --> 00:59:13.917
SUPPORTS YOU AND WANTS YOU TO DO

00:59:13.983 --> 00:59:16.719
THINGS AND WANTS YOU TO BE ABLE

00:59:16.786 --> 00:59:17.520
TO PLAY A SPORT AND HAVE TO

00:59:17.587 --> 00:59:18.621
PRACTICE IN THE NIGHT. AND IT'S

00:59:18.688 --> 00:59:20.356
OKAY. IT'S OKAY TO GO ON

00:59:20.423 --> 00:59:21.791
VACATION WITH YOUR FAMILY AND

00:59:21.858 --> 00:59:23.226
YOU ENCOURAGE THAT, LIKE, OH, I

00:59:23.293 --> 00:59:24.994
HOPE YOU HAVE FUN WITH YOUR

00:59:25.061 --> 00:59:26.362
FAMILY AND, YOU KNOW, CALL ME

00:59:26.429 --> 00:59:28.531
WHENEVER YOU GET A CHANCE. BUT

00:59:28.598 --> 00:59:28.965
WHEN YOU HAVE THOSE

00:59:29.032 --> 00:59:30.233
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT THAT

00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:30.900
LOOKS LIKE WITH YOUR CHILD, YOU

00:59:30.967 --> 00:59:33.436
REALLY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO BE

00:59:33.503 --> 00:59:34.370
ABLE TO EXPLAIN, LIKE, THIS IS

00:59:34.437 --> 00:59:35.672
WHAT UNHEALTHY LOOKS LIKE, AND

00:59:35.738 --> 00:59:37.407
THIS IS WHAT HEALTHY LOOKS LIKE,

00:59:37.473 --> 00:59:38.474
AND HELPING THEM TO SEE, WELL,

00:59:38.541 --> 00:59:40.576
REALLY, BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK

00:59:40.643 --> 00:59:41.577
THAT THIS BECAUSE THAT'S I THINK

00:59:41.644 --> 00:59:42.612
WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T

00:59:42.679 --> 00:59:44.747
REALIZE IS THEY DON'T EVEN THINK

00:59:44.814 --> 00:59:45.982
THAT MAYBE THINGS THAT ARE NOT

00:59:46.049 --> 00:59:47.417
HEALTHY, YOU KNOW, ARE NOT ARE

00:59:47.483 --> 00:59:48.918
NOT UNHEALTHY. RIGHT? LIKE THEY

00:59:48.985 --> 00:59:49.652
JUST THINK LIKE, OH, THAT'S

00:59:49.719 --> 00:59:51.487
NORMAL. LIKE, THAT'S NOT THAT

00:59:51.554 --> 00:59:53.323
BIG OF A DEAL. IT'S NOT THAT,

00:59:53.389 --> 00:59:54.924
YEAH, THEY MISS ME OR THEY THINK

00:59:54.991 --> 00:59:56.292
THIS ISN'T NORMAL. IT'S OKAY.

00:59:56.359 --> 00:59:57.794
AND SO I THINK THAT UNTIL YOU

00:59:57.860 --> 00:59:58.594
HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS,

00:59:58.661 --> 00:59:59.562
SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T EVEN

00:59:59.629 --> 01:00:00.663
REALIZE IT. THEY'RE LIKE REALLY

01:00:00.730 --> 01:00:01.864
LIKE, OKAY, I DIDN'T THINK IT

01:00:01.931 --> 01:00:04.000
WAS THAT BIG A DEAL THAT THEY'RE

01:00:04.067 --> 01:00:05.468
CALLING ME 20 TIMES OR THAT

01:00:05.535 --> 01:00:06.602
THEY'RE MESSAGING ME OR THAT

01:00:06.669 --> 01:00:08.871
THEY SEE THAT, YOU KNOW, NOW

01:00:08.938 --> 01:00:09.439
IT'S TURNED INTO, YOU KNOW,

01:00:09.505 --> 01:00:11.240
EVERY SINGLE MINUTE BECAUSE I

01:00:11.307 --> 01:00:12.208
HAVEN'T RESPONDED NOW, THAT'S

01:00:12.275 --> 01:00:14.777
NOT OKAY. SO IT'S HAVING THOSE

01:00:14.844 --> 01:00:15.445
CONVERSATIONS. AND I THINK

01:00:15.511 --> 01:00:17.180
REALLY HAVING PARENTS LOOK AT IS

01:00:17.246 --> 01:00:19.048
THEIR CHILD CHANGED THE WAY THAT

01:00:19.115 --> 01:00:20.583
THEY DRESS. HAVE THEY CHANGED

01:00:20.650 --> 01:00:21.951
THEIR FRIENDS? ARE THEY NOT

01:00:22.018 --> 01:00:23.019
HANGING OUT WITH THEIR FRIENDS

01:00:23.086 --> 01:00:25.688
LIKE THEY USED TO? BECAUSE I

01:00:25.755 --> 01:00:26.990
HAVE THAT'S A HUGE SIGN FOR ME.

01:00:27.056 --> 01:00:28.424
IF YOU'VE BEEN FRIENDS WITH

01:00:28.491 --> 01:00:29.258
SOMEBODY SINCE KINDERGARTEN AND

01:00:29.325 --> 01:00:29.892
NOW YOU'RE DATING SOMEBODY, AND

01:00:29.959 --> 01:00:31.561
NOW YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO TALK

01:00:31.627 --> 01:00:32.895
TO THAT PERSON ANYMORE, FIRST OF

01:00:32.962 --> 01:00:34.497
ALL, YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED. LIKE,

01:00:34.564 --> 01:00:35.498
THAT SHOULDN'T BE, RIGHT?

01:00:35.565 --> 01:00:36.299
BECAUSE IN A HEALTHY

01:00:36.366 --> 01:00:36.933
RELATIONSHIP, THERE'S EQUALITY

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.501
WHERE THE SAME NOBODY HAS MORE

01:00:38.568 --> 01:00:39.902
POWER THAN THE OTHER PERSON. WE

01:00:39.969 --> 01:00:41.170
MAKE DECISIONS, WE WORK TOGETHER

01:00:41.237 --> 01:00:42.905
AS A TEAM. WE COMPROMISE. WE

01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:46.442
HAVE COMMUNICATION AND UNHEALTHY

01:00:46.509 --> 01:00:47.477
RELATIONSHIPS. IT'S JUST WHAT

01:00:47.543 --> 01:00:49.345
THE OTHER PERSON WANTS OR WHAT

01:00:49.412 --> 01:00:50.813
THEY FEEL. WELL, I FEEL LIKE YOU

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:52.548
SHOULDN'T HANG OUT WITH THAT

01:00:52.615 --> 01:00:53.616
GROUP BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE THE

01:00:53.683 --> 01:00:55.385
WAY THAT THEY, YOU KNOW, THEY

01:00:55.451 --> 01:00:56.586
ACT. AND I DON'T THINK THEY'RE A

01:00:56.652 --> 01:00:58.287
GOOD INFLUENCE ON YOU. SO I'D

01:00:58.354 --> 01:01:00.456
RATHER YOU JUST HANG OUT WITH

01:01:00.523 --> 01:01:01.024
ME, YOU KNOW, CREATING THAT

01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:02.425
ISOLATION, BUT VERY SUBTLY. I

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:04.627
MEAN, A LOT OF TIMES IT DOESN'T

01:01:04.694 --> 01:01:06.229
COME JUST LIKE, OH, I DON'T WANT

01:01:06.295 --> 01:01:07.296
YOU TALKING TO THIS PERSON. IT'S

01:01:07.363 --> 01:01:08.498
VERY. YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T

01:01:08.564 --> 01:01:10.333
THINK THAT THEY'RE THE BEST

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.201
GROUP OF FRIENDS, YOU KNOW? LOOK

01:01:12.268 --> 01:01:13.569
AT HOW THEY ACT EVERY TIME

01:01:13.636 --> 01:01:14.437
YOU'RE WITH THEM. WE FIGHT. IS

01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:16.005
THAT REALLY WHAT YOU WANT? YOU

01:01:16.072 --> 01:01:17.340
WANT TO FIGHT AND THAT

01:01:17.407 --> 01:01:18.741
MANIPULATION TAKES PLACE. AND SO

01:01:18.808 --> 01:01:20.410
IT'S REALLY HELPING SOMEBODY TO

01:01:20.476 --> 01:01:22.011
KIND OF UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT

01:01:22.078 --> 01:01:22.645
LOOKS LIKE. AND THANK YOU. ANY

01:01:22.712 --> 01:01:23.713
QUESTIONS? SO I JUST WANT TO I'M

01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:26.682
NOT A PARENT, BUT THIS TOPIC IS

01:01:26.749 --> 01:01:28.785
DEEPLY, DEEPLY PERSONAL TO ME. I

01:01:28.851 --> 01:01:30.653
GREW UP IN A VERY SHELTERED

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:33.189
LIFE. I WASN'T ALLOWED TO DATE,

01:01:33.256 --> 01:01:35.124
AND WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT DATING.

01:01:35.191 --> 01:01:36.793
WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT

01:01:36.859 --> 01:01:37.894
RELATIONSHIPS BECAUSE I JUST SAW

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:40.096
MY HAPPILY MARRIED PARENTS AND

01:01:40.163 --> 01:01:40.897
GRANDPARENTS, AND THAT WAS KIND

01:01:40.963 --> 01:01:43.299
OF IT. AND UNFORTUNATELY, A

01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:44.734
YOUNG MAN CAME INTO MY LIFE AND

01:01:44.801 --> 01:01:46.869
HE FORMED WHAT A RELATIONSHIP

01:01:46.936 --> 01:01:47.937
SHOULD LOOK LIKE. AND IT WAS

01:01:48.004 --> 01:01:49.238
EXTREMELY ABUSIVE EMOTIONALLY

01:01:49.305 --> 01:01:52.275
AND PHYSICALLY. AND I BECAME SO

01:01:52.341 --> 01:01:54.444
GOOD AT HIDING IT FROM MY

01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:56.646
PARENTS THAT WHEN I FINALLY HAD

01:01:56.712 --> 01:01:58.247
THOSE MOMENTS THAT I HAD TO GO

01:01:58.314 --> 01:01:59.549
TO MY PARENTS, IT WAS JUST IT

01:01:59.615 --> 01:02:01.084
WAS HEARTBREAKING TO SEE IN

01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:03.419
THEIR EYES THAT THEY FELT LIKE

01:02:03.486 --> 01:02:04.620
THEY HAD FAILED AS A PARENT, AND

01:02:04.687 --> 01:02:06.089
THEY DIDN'T. THEY HAD GIVEN ME

01:02:06.155 --> 01:02:07.957
EVERY OPPORTUNITY AND ALL OF THE

01:02:08.024 --> 01:02:09.492
LOVE AND EVEN THE PEOPLE CLOSE

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:11.661
TO ME DIDN'T KNOW, BECAUSE I WAS

01:02:11.727 --> 01:02:13.062
SO CONDITIONED TO HIDE IT FROM

01:02:13.129 --> 01:02:15.798
THE PEOPLE THAT I LOVE. EARLIER

01:02:15.865 --> 01:02:17.400
THIS YEAR, I WAS ON A LISTENING

01:02:17.467 --> 01:02:18.601
SESSION AT THE MARJAREE MASON

01:02:18.668 --> 01:02:20.169
CENTER, AND IT WAS ALL

01:02:20.236 --> 01:02:21.704
TEENAGERS. AND I MEAN, IT WAS

01:02:21.771 --> 01:02:22.538
HEARTBREAKING THAT THEY'RE

01:02:22.605 --> 01:02:23.739
TALKING TO ME ABOUT, TO YOUR

01:02:23.806 --> 01:02:25.007
POINT, WEARING T SHIRTS THAT

01:02:25.074 --> 01:02:26.409
HAVE THEIR SIGNIFICANT OTHER'S

01:02:26.476 --> 01:02:27.543
NAMES ON THEM, THEY'RE NOT

01:02:27.610 --> 01:02:29.112
ALLOWED TO TALK TO OTHER PEOPLE.

01:02:29.178 --> 01:02:31.114
THE STRANGULATION THAT'S

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:32.548
HAPPENING AS A RESULT OF YOUNG

01:02:32.615 --> 01:02:34.884
MEN WATCHING PORNOGRAPHY AND

01:02:34.951 --> 01:02:36.185
BELIEVING THAT THAT'S A NORMAL

01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:38.754
SEX LIFE. AND IT WAS SO HARD TO

01:02:38.821 --> 01:02:39.755
HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH

01:02:39.822 --> 01:02:40.857
TEENAGERS BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:02:40.923 --> 01:02:42.091
CHILDREN. RIGHT. AND I'M SITTING

01:02:42.158 --> 01:02:44.494
HERE 31 YEARS OLD, THINKING, OH

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:46.329
MY GOSH, I CAN'T BELIEVE AT THAT

01:02:46.395 --> 01:02:48.397
AGE I WOULD HAVE TO THINK OF

01:02:48.464 --> 01:02:49.732
THESE THINGS. BUT YOU, YOU DO.

01:02:49.799 --> 01:02:51.400
AND SO THAT'S WHAT'S SO TOUGH

01:02:51.467 --> 01:02:53.236
FOR ME, IS I KNEW I COULDN'T GO

01:02:53.302 --> 01:02:54.537
TO MY PARENTS WITH THIS BECAUSE

01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:56.439
I FELT SHAME FOR WHAT I WAS

01:02:56.506 --> 01:02:58.040
GOING THROUGH. SO I ALSO

01:02:58.107 --> 01:02:58.808
RECOGNIZE FOR EDUCATORS, IT'S A

01:02:58.875 --> 01:03:00.243
REALLY TOUCHY PLACE TO TALK

01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:03.179
ABOUT THESE THINGS. SO I HAD A

01:03:03.246 --> 01:03:05.248
BILL THAT I ACTUALLY MADE INTO A

01:03:05.314 --> 01:03:06.549
TWO YEAR BILL BECAUSE I REALLY

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:08.684
WANTED TO DEEP DIVE INTO THIS.

01:03:08.751 --> 01:03:09.385
I'M SO GRATEFUL YOU GUYS ARE

01:03:09.452 --> 01:03:11.287
HERE TODAY BECAUSE I WANT TO

01:03:11.354 --> 01:03:12.522
HELP TEENS. I WANT TO ACTUALLY

01:03:12.588 --> 01:03:13.689
GIVE THEM RESOURCES. AND ONE OF

01:03:13.756 --> 01:03:16.192
THE THINGS THAT I HEARD WAS THAT

01:03:16.259 --> 01:03:17.426
THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO IDENTIFY

01:03:17.493 --> 01:03:18.394
THINGS. YOU KNOW, WHAT IS

01:03:18.461 --> 01:03:20.096
ASSAULT, WHAT IS BULLYING. AND

01:03:20.163 --> 01:03:21.931
THEN TALKING ABOUT THOSE THINGS

01:03:21.998 --> 01:03:23.032
IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE FOR SOME

01:03:23.099 --> 01:03:24.467
PEOPLE. SO I GUESS MY QUESTION

01:03:24.534 --> 01:03:27.036
IS, IS WHEN PARENTS CAN'T BE THE

01:03:27.103 --> 01:03:28.738
ONE TO BE THE RESOURCE. AND

01:03:28.804 --> 01:03:30.573
WE'RE ASKING SO MUCH OF OUR

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.141
EDUCATORS RIGHT NOW, WHAT WOULD

01:03:32.208 --> 01:03:34.243
BE THE BEST INTERVENTION AS FAR

01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:35.945
AS PARENTS FEELING COMFORTABLE

01:03:36.012 --> 01:03:37.747
WITH SOMEBODY THAT'S NOT THEM

01:03:37.813 --> 01:03:38.915
TALKING TO THEIR CHILD ABOUT

01:03:38.981 --> 01:03:40.616
THESE THINGS AND NOT PUTTING IT

01:03:40.683 --> 01:03:42.385
ON AN EDUCATOR, THAT IF A CHILD

01:03:42.451 --> 01:03:43.953
IS GOING THROUGH SOMETHING THEY

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:44.554
AREN'T PUTTING THEMSELVES OR

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:46.189
THEIR CAREER IN JEOPARDY BY NOT

01:03:46.255 --> 01:03:47.623
SAYING SOMETHING OR SAYING

01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:48.891
SOMETHING, RIGHT. YOU KNOW, I

01:03:48.958 --> 01:03:50.193
THINK THAT'S WHY I'M SO GRATEFUL

01:03:50.259 --> 01:03:51.761
FOR SOME OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:03:51.827 --> 01:03:53.896
THAT HAVE ALLOWED ME TO COME IN

01:03:53.963 --> 01:03:54.797
BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE THAT. SO

01:03:54.864 --> 01:03:56.465
THEY THEY BROUGHT THIS IN AS A

01:03:56.532 --> 01:03:58.634
WAY TO COVER THE AB. 329 TALKING

01:03:58.701 --> 01:04:00.403
ABOUT SEX ED AND INTERPERSONAL

01:04:00.469 --> 01:04:02.405
VIOLENCE. AND SO THEY HAVE ME

01:04:02.471 --> 01:04:03.873
COME IN DURING THAT SCIENCE

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:05.541
CLASS WHEN THE SCIENCE TEACHERS

01:04:05.608 --> 01:04:06.876
USUALLY TALK ABOUT IT. BUT THEY

01:04:06.943 --> 01:04:08.344
SAID, HEY, WE WANT TO BRING IN

01:04:08.411 --> 01:04:09.879
AN EXPERT INSTEAD OF HAVING TO

01:04:09.946 --> 01:04:11.514
PUT THIS ON OUR SCIENCE TEACHER

01:04:11.581 --> 01:04:13.049
WHO REALLY ISN'T, YOU KNOW,

01:04:13.115 --> 01:04:14.450
DOESN'T HAVE ALL OF THIS

01:04:14.517 --> 01:04:15.585
INFORMATION ABOUT THIS. WE'RE

01:04:15.651 --> 01:04:16.686
GOING TO HAVE YOU COME IN AND

01:04:16.752 --> 01:04:20.122
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE YOU TALK

01:04:20.189 --> 01:04:20.790
ABOUT THIS. AND I FEEL LIKE WHEN

01:04:20.856 --> 01:04:22.258
I TALKED WITH THE KIDS, SO MUCH

01:04:22.325 --> 01:04:23.392
CONVERSATION CAME UP ABOUT IT

01:04:23.459 --> 01:04:25.661
THAT THEN THEY SAID, HEY, CAN

01:04:25.728 --> 01:04:26.495
YOU DO THE SAME CONVERSATION

01:04:26.562 --> 01:04:27.663
THAT YOU DID WITH THE KIDS, WITH

01:04:27.730 --> 01:04:29.732
THE PARENTS? AND SO I WAS ABLE

01:04:29.799 --> 01:04:31.400
TO DO THAT. AND SO THAT'S WHAT

01:04:31.467 --> 01:04:33.669
I'M I'M SEEING THAT THEIR SCHOOL

01:04:33.736 --> 01:04:34.270
DISTRICTS THAT ARE OPENING UP

01:04:34.337 --> 01:04:35.471
AND SAYING, HEY, WE WANT THIS.

01:04:35.538 --> 01:04:37.807
IT'S BEEN SUCH A HARD THING TO

01:04:37.873 --> 01:04:38.741
DO TO TALK ABOUT THIS

01:04:38.808 --> 01:04:39.842
CONVERSATION IN SCHOOLS, BECAUSE

01:04:39.909 --> 01:04:41.510
A LOT OF SCHOOLS ARE LIKE, NO,

01:04:41.577 --> 01:04:42.712
WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE THIS

01:04:42.778 --> 01:04:43.412
CONVERSATION. THIS ISN'T

01:04:43.479 --> 01:04:45.982
HAPPENING IN OUR SCHOOLS, BUT IT

01:04:46.048 --> 01:04:47.250
IS. AND, AND JUST LIKE YOU SAID

01:04:47.316 --> 01:04:48.517
MANY TIMES, THE KIDS AREN'T

01:04:48.584 --> 01:04:50.286
AFRAID. SO WHEN I TALK ABOUT IT,

01:04:50.353 --> 01:04:52.321
IT KIND OF BRINGS IT UP. SO I

01:04:52.388 --> 01:04:53.356
GIVE THEM STICKERS. I SAW THE

01:04:53.422 --> 01:04:54.457
KIDS WALKING AROUND AFTER, LIKE

01:04:54.523 --> 01:04:56.592
I SAW THEM AGAIN AND THEY'RE

01:04:56.659 --> 01:04:57.927
LIKE, HEY, THAT'S A RED FLAG,

01:04:57.994 --> 01:04:59.428
THAT'S A RED FLAG. AND IT WAS

01:04:59.495 --> 01:05:00.863
MUCH MORE JUST LIKE A NORMALIZED

01:05:00.930 --> 01:05:02.398
CONVERSATION SO THAT IT KEEPS IT

01:05:02.465 --> 01:05:03.866
FRESH IN THEIR MIND, LIKE, HEY,

01:05:03.933 --> 01:05:05.434
THIS ISN'T OKAY. AND THE KIDS

01:05:05.501 --> 01:05:07.370
WERE COMING UP TO ME AFTER,

01:05:07.436 --> 01:05:09.472
LIKE, HEY, I HAVE A FRIEND THAT,

01:05:09.538 --> 01:05:10.339
YOU KNOW, TRYING TO. AND IT WAS

01:05:10.406 --> 01:05:11.641
GOOD BECAUSE IT GAVE THAT

01:05:11.707 --> 01:05:13.776
OPPORTUNITY FOR IT TO BE

01:05:13.843 --> 01:05:14.443
COMFORTABLE WHERE IT WASN'T THE

01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:15.278
TEACHER, IT WASN'T THEIR

01:05:15.344 --> 01:05:16.679
PARENTS. BUT WE WERE ABLE TO

01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:18.247
REALLY HAVE SOME AUTHENTIC

01:05:18.314 --> 01:05:18.981
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT THEY

01:05:19.048 --> 01:05:20.016
WERE GOING THROUGH, WHAT THEIR

01:05:20.082 --> 01:05:20.650
EXPERIENCES LOOKED LIKE. I WAS

01:05:20.716 --> 01:05:22.585
ASKING THEM, WHAT DO YOU GUYS

01:05:22.652 --> 01:05:24.453
SEE ON CAMPUS? TELL ME WHAT YOU

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:26.222
GUYS. AND THE EXAMPLES THAT THEY

01:05:26.289 --> 01:05:27.757
GIVE IS THAT, WELL, YOU KNOW, WE

01:05:27.823 --> 01:05:29.225
CAN'T DO THIS. WE CAN'T BECAUSE

01:05:29.292 --> 01:05:31.527
MY PARTNER DOESN'T LET ME I HAVE

01:05:31.594 --> 01:05:33.262
TO I'M ONLY ALLOWED TO POST SO

01:05:33.329 --> 01:05:33.896
MANY THINGS ON INSTAGRAM. MY

01:05:33.963 --> 01:05:35.564
PARTNER WANTS SHOWS ME A PICTURE

01:05:35.631 --> 01:05:36.999
THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO, AND

01:05:37.066 --> 01:05:38.801
THEY WANT ME TO TRY THIS. AND

01:05:38.868 --> 01:05:39.869
I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE. BUT

01:05:39.935 --> 01:05:41.604
BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT THIS IS

01:05:41.671 --> 01:05:43.406
WHAT NORMALIZED SEXUAL ACTIVITY

01:05:43.472 --> 01:05:44.540
LOOKS LIKE, BECAUSE THEY HAVE

01:05:44.607 --> 01:05:46.242
ACCESS TO SO MANY THINGS THAT

01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:47.310
THEY'RE NOT COMFORTABLE DOING AT

01:05:47.376 --> 01:05:49.512
12, 13 YEARS OLD, BUT THEY'RE

01:05:49.578 --> 01:05:50.046
MAKING AND SENDING VIDEOS

01:05:50.112 --> 01:05:51.847
BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT THAT'S

01:05:51.914 --> 01:05:53.082
PART OF A NORMAL RELATIONSHIP.

01:05:53.149 --> 01:05:54.550
IT'S SO HEARTBREAKING. NO,

01:05:54.617 --> 01:05:56.319
ABSOLUTELY. IT IS VERY

01:05:56.385 --> 01:05:57.119
HEARTBREAKING. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:05:57.186 --> 01:05:58.587
AND I'M GLAD THAT YOU BROUGHT

01:05:58.654 --> 01:05:59.989
THAT UP TOO, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

01:06:00.056 --> 01:06:02.558
WE'RE WE'RE RIGHT AT THE MOMENT.

01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:04.193
WE'RE IN A CROSSROADS, IF YOU

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:06.429
WILL, WHERE WE DON'T TRUST. YOU

01:06:06.495 --> 01:06:07.863
KNOW, THAT THAT IT'S NOT LIKE

01:06:07.930 --> 01:06:09.231
THE OLDEN DAYS WHERE THE

01:06:09.298 --> 01:06:10.833
NEIGHBORS WOULD HELP OR, YOU

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:12.935
KNOW, WHATEVER THE ADAGES WERE

01:06:13.002 --> 01:06:14.003
THAT, YOU KNOW, THE NEIGHBORS

01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:15.538
COULD SCOLD YOU AND IT WAS,

01:06:15.604 --> 01:06:17.873
OKAY, WE'RE IN A TIME WHERE

01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:19.975
WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO OBVIOUSLY

01:06:20.042 --> 01:06:21.844
BE PROTECTIVE OF OUR CHILDREN,

01:06:21.911 --> 01:06:24.447
BUT WHERE IS THAT LINE? YOU

01:06:24.513 --> 01:06:26.015
KNOW, YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU GO

01:06:26.082 --> 01:06:28.117
INTO THE SCIENCE CLASSROOMS. DO

01:06:28.184 --> 01:06:29.819
THEY HAVE TO FILL OUT A

01:06:29.885 --> 01:06:31.420
PERMISSION SLIP TO GET THAT

01:06:31.487 --> 01:06:34.090
CONVERSATION? SO, SO SEE THAT

01:06:34.156 --> 01:06:36.859
THAT THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES,

01:06:36.926 --> 01:06:38.594
WHAT IF A PARENT DOESN'T? SO

01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:39.628
WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE CHILDREN

01:06:39.695 --> 01:06:41.297
THAT ARE NOT GETTING THE

01:06:41.364 --> 01:06:43.766
CONVERSATIONS. AND CAN YOU TALK

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:46.068
A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE

01:06:46.135 --> 01:06:47.436
PARENTS, WHAT YOU DID WITH THE

01:06:47.503 --> 01:06:49.305
PARENTS. SO BEFORE WE CONTINUE

01:06:49.372 --> 01:06:50.272
ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S STEPHANIE, ANY

01:06:50.339 --> 01:06:53.242
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS HERE? YES.

01:06:53.309 --> 01:06:54.043
THANK YOU CHAIR, AND IT'S AN

01:06:54.110 --> 01:06:55.845
HONOR TO BE ON THIS. I HAVE LONG

01:06:55.911 --> 01:06:57.613
ADMIRED YOU FOR YOUR WORK, AND

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:59.382
BEFORE I EVEN MET YOU, I WANTED

01:06:59.448 --> 01:07:01.717
A CHANCE TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH

01:07:01.784 --> 01:07:03.319
YOU ON THIS TOPIC. SO IT'S

01:07:03.386 --> 01:07:04.520
REALLY AN HONOR TO BE HERE

01:07:04.587 --> 01:07:06.422
TODAY. AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

01:07:06.489 --> 01:07:07.656
YOUR TESTIMONY SO FAR. AND

01:07:07.723 --> 01:07:08.758
TAYLOR, ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU

01:07:08.824 --> 01:07:10.926
FROM SAN FRANCISCO. AND YOU

01:07:10.993 --> 01:07:13.462
KNOW, FOR ME, THIS TOPIC IS SO

01:07:13.529 --> 01:07:14.597
PERSONAL TOO. I GREW UP IN A

01:07:14.663 --> 01:07:16.999
HOME OF A LOT OF DOMESTIC

01:07:17.066 --> 01:07:18.434
VIOLENCE. WHEN MY MOM MARRIED MY

01:07:18.501 --> 01:07:21.003
STEPDAD WHEN I WAS NINE YEARS

01:07:21.070 --> 01:07:22.238
OLD, AND SHE WAS IN THAT

01:07:22.304 --> 01:07:24.273
RELATIONSHIP FOR 41 YEARS, AND

01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:26.075
HE WAS VERY ABUSIVE. AND IT TOOK

01:07:26.142 --> 01:07:28.511
HER 41 YEARS TO GET OUT. AND

01:07:28.577 --> 01:07:31.013
I'VE SEEN THE ISOLATION, THE

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:33.149
COERCIVE FINANCIAL CONTROL AND

01:07:33.215 --> 01:07:34.283
THEN WHAT IT DOES TO THE

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:37.219
CHILDREN. I'M THE OLDEST OF FOUR

01:07:37.286 --> 01:07:40.322
FOR MY MOM AND DAD. AND YOU KNOW

01:07:40.389 --> 01:07:44.026
WHAT I SAW? NO, NO KID SHOULD

01:07:44.093 --> 01:07:44.794
HAVE TO EXPERIENCE. AND THERE'S

01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:46.829
A LOT OF TRAUMA THAT PEOPLE HAVE

01:07:46.896 --> 01:07:48.230
TO RECOVER FROM. AND, YOU KNOW,

01:07:48.297 --> 01:07:50.166
A LOT OF TIMES, TOO, THE SYSTEMS

01:07:50.232 --> 01:07:51.700
THAT WERE MEANT TO PROTECT MY

01:07:51.767 --> 01:07:53.302
MOM JUST WEREN'T THERE TO

01:07:53.369 --> 01:07:54.370
PROTECT HER OR CPS, YOU KNOW,

01:07:54.437 --> 01:07:56.605
JUST THEY DID NOT WORK IN A WAY

01:07:56.672 --> 01:07:57.706
THAT PROVIDED ANY RELIEF FOR

01:07:57.773 --> 01:07:59.375
THOSE BEING ABUSED AND FOR THE

01:07:59.442 --> 01:08:03.245
VICTIMS. IN THAT CASE. AND YOU

01:08:03.312 --> 01:08:03.946
KNOW WHAT I'VE ALSO NOTICED,

01:08:04.013 --> 01:08:08.050
TOO, IS ALWAYS IT SEEMS THAT OUR

01:08:08.117 --> 01:08:10.953
SOCIETY PUTS THE ONUS ON THE

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:12.388
VICTIM OR THE ONE BEING ABUSED

01:08:12.455 --> 01:08:14.590
TO FIX THE PROBLEM. LIKE THE

01:08:14.657 --> 01:08:15.958
QUESTION IS ALWAYS, WELL, WHY

01:08:16.025 --> 01:08:17.827
DOESN'T SHE LEAVE? INSTEAD OF

01:08:17.893 --> 01:08:20.262
WHY DOESN'T HE STOP? YOU KNOW?

01:08:20.329 --> 01:08:24.366
AND SO I THINK SOME OF THE FOCUS

01:08:24.433 --> 01:08:26.535
WHICH I KNOW WE'RE DOING,

01:08:26.602 --> 01:08:28.003
WHETHER IT'S SCHOOLS OR A LOT OF

01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:30.105
TIMES IT'S IN THE JAILS. SONNY

01:08:30.172 --> 01:08:31.073
SCHWARTZ IN SAN FRANCISCO HAS

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:33.742
DEVELOPED AN INCREDIBLE PROGRAM

01:08:33.809 --> 01:08:35.044
FOR THOSE THAT HAVE ABUSED

01:08:35.110 --> 01:08:39.381
WOMEN. TO REALLY FOCUS ON, OKAY,

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:41.550
HOW DO WE EDUCATE THOSE THAT ARE

01:08:41.617 --> 01:08:42.985
VICTIMS AND BEING ABUSED AND

01:08:43.052 --> 01:08:44.820
HELP THEM GET OUT OF THAT

01:08:44.887 --> 01:08:46.956
SITUATION? AND HOW DO WE LOOK AT

01:08:47.022 --> 01:08:50.326
THE TEENS, THOSE, YOU KNOW, THE

01:08:50.392 --> 01:08:51.260
THOSE THAT ARE ABUSING, HOW DO

01:08:51.327 --> 01:08:55.030
WE GET PROGRAMS TO THEM TO HELP

01:08:55.097 --> 01:08:57.800
THEM SEE THIS IS NOT A ROAD THEY

01:08:57.867 --> 01:09:00.669
WANT TO GO DOWN OR THESE ARE

01:09:00.736 --> 01:09:02.471
FEELINGS INSIDE OR THESE ARE

01:09:02.538 --> 01:09:04.173
ACTIONS THAT THEY'RE TAKING THAT

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:05.708
THEY SHOULD RECOGNIZE, AND THEY

01:09:05.774 --> 01:09:07.843
SHOULD HAVE SOMEWHERE TO GO TO

01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:09.245
HELP TO. ABSOLUTELY. SO I JUST

01:09:09.311 --> 01:09:11.380
WANT TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT YOU

01:09:11.447 --> 01:09:12.748
FOCUS ON THAT OR IF THERE'S

01:09:12.815 --> 01:09:13.983
ANYTHING BEING DONE IN OUR

01:09:14.049 --> 01:09:15.784
SCHOOLS TO ALSO LOOK AT THAT

01:09:15.851 --> 01:09:18.254
FROM THAT ANGLE. I MEAN, I

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:19.722
APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THAT UP.

01:09:19.788 --> 01:09:21.624
THANK YOU ALSO, BOTH OF YOU, FOR

01:09:21.690 --> 01:09:22.758
KIND OF SHARING YOUR PERSONAL

01:09:22.825 --> 01:09:24.927
INSIGHT ON THIS, BECAUSE IT

01:09:24.994 --> 01:09:26.662
AFFECTS SO MANY PEOPLE. AND I

01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:29.231
DON'T THINK I MEAN, JUST LIKE IN

01:09:29.298 --> 01:09:29.832
THIS SPACE ALONE, WE ARE, YOU

01:09:29.899 --> 01:09:31.734
KNOW, YOU GUYS WERE ABLE TO

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:33.402
SHARE THAT THE TRAUMA THAT

01:09:33.469 --> 01:09:36.605
AFFECTS CHILDREN IS LIFELONG.

01:09:36.672 --> 01:09:37.840
FOR KIDS THAT GROW UP IN HOMES

01:09:37.907 --> 01:09:40.643
WHERE THEY WITNESS VIOLENCE,

01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:42.478
MORE THAN 50% OF THOSE CHILDREN

01:09:42.545 --> 01:09:44.947
ARE ALSO ABUSED AS WELL. AND SO

01:09:45.014 --> 01:09:47.783
THEY ALSO HAVE THE LONG LASTING

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:50.719
EFFECTS FROM THAT TRAUMA THAT,

01:09:50.786 --> 01:09:52.154
YOU KNOW, FROM, FROM EVEN

01:09:52.221 --> 01:09:53.589
CHILDREN WHO ARE AS EARLY AS

01:09:53.656 --> 01:09:56.725
I'VE SEEN, ONE YEARS OLD, WHO

01:09:56.792 --> 01:10:00.095
HAVE, YOU KNOW, THE EFFECTS OF

01:10:00.162 --> 01:10:01.964
JUST NOT BEING ABLE TO EAT,

01:10:02.031 --> 01:10:04.066
HAVING DIGESTIVE ISSUES AT

01:10:04.133 --> 01:10:05.467
BABIES BECAUSE THEY'VE COME FROM

01:10:05.534 --> 01:10:06.535
HOMES WHERE THEY'VE WITNESSED

01:10:06.602 --> 01:10:08.070
VIOLENCE, AND THEN UP UNTIL THE,

01:10:08.137 --> 01:10:09.838
THE MIDDLE SCHOOL AGE AND

01:10:09.905 --> 01:10:11.574
TEENAGERS, THAT THAT TRAUMA

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:15.177
TRULY AFFECTS CHILDREN. WHAT I'M

01:10:15.244 --> 01:10:18.447
TRYING TO DO IS ALSO INCORPORATE

01:10:18.514 --> 01:10:20.883
SELF-ESTEEM BUILDING WORKSHOPS,

01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:23.419
BECAUSE I DO KNOW THAT THAT IS

01:10:23.485 --> 01:10:25.287
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR CHILDREN

01:10:25.354 --> 01:10:27.289
WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED AND

01:10:27.356 --> 01:10:30.926
WITNESSED ABUSE MANY TIMES IT

01:10:30.993 --> 01:10:32.695
YEARS BEFORE THEY EVER SHARE IT.

01:10:32.761 --> 01:10:35.531
THEY NEVER TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE

01:10:35.598 --> 01:10:36.832
IT'S BEEN TAUGHT WHAT HAPPENS IN

01:10:36.899 --> 01:10:39.668
THE HOME STAYS IN THE HOME AND

01:10:39.735 --> 01:10:40.269
YOU DON'T SHARE THOSE THINGS.

01:10:40.336 --> 01:10:41.770
AND SO IT TAKES A LONG TIME. OR

01:10:41.837 --> 01:10:43.806
SOMETIMES IT'S THE FIRST TIME ME

01:10:43.872 --> 01:10:45.007
GOING INTO A SCHOOL TALKING

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:46.442
ABOUT IT. THERE WAS A KID THAT

01:10:46.508 --> 01:10:48.677
CAME UP TO ME AFTER AND SAID,

01:10:48.744 --> 01:10:50.012
HOW DID YOU KNOW MY HOUSE? LIKE,

01:10:50.079 --> 01:10:51.780
HOW DID YOU KNOW? AND I HE

01:10:51.847 --> 01:10:53.682
THOUGHT I WAS TALKING ABOUT HIM.

01:10:53.749 --> 01:10:55.751
HE CAME UP TO ME AFTER AND I WAS

01:10:55.818 --> 01:10:58.020
JUST LIKE, HE HE WAS UPSET

01:10:58.087 --> 01:10:59.521
BECAUSE HE THOUGHT I WAS TALKING

01:10:59.588 --> 01:11:00.823
ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT WAS

01:11:00.889 --> 01:11:01.790
HAPPENING IN HIS HOME. BUT ALSO

01:11:01.857 --> 01:11:04.727
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT HE

01:11:04.793 --> 01:11:05.628
WAS EVER ABLE TO TALK. SO JUST

01:11:05.694 --> 01:11:07.396
BEING ABLE TO BE ALLOWED IN

01:11:07.463 --> 01:11:08.764
THESE SPACES, I THINK, IS WHAT

01:11:08.831 --> 01:11:10.599
REALLY IS WHERE WE START BEING

01:11:10.666 --> 01:11:11.333
PREVENTATIVE AND TALKING ABOUT

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:12.601
WHAT HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS LOOK

01:11:12.668 --> 01:11:14.837
LIKE. I'M TRYING TO INCORPORATE

01:11:14.903 --> 01:11:16.639
THIS. I WAS SHARING WITH THE

01:11:16.705 --> 01:11:17.573
ASSEMBLYWOMAN THAT I'M WORKING

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:20.142
WITH LIKE ATHLETE ORIENTATION.

01:11:20.209 --> 01:11:21.644
SO THIS BECOMES PART OF THE

01:11:21.710 --> 01:11:23.812
ORIENTATION FOR ALL ATHLETES IN

01:11:23.879 --> 01:11:25.681
SCHOOLS SO THAT WHEN THEY GET

01:11:25.748 --> 01:11:27.016
THEIR REGULAR ATHLETIC

01:11:27.082 --> 01:11:27.983
ORIENTATION, THEN I'M PART OF

01:11:28.050 --> 01:11:30.719
THAT ATHLETIC ORIENTATION, JUST

01:11:30.786 --> 01:11:32.554
DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE CAN TRY

01:11:32.621 --> 01:11:34.556
TO HOW DO WE GET IN THERE AND

01:11:34.623 --> 01:11:35.691
HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS IN IN

01:11:35.758 --> 01:11:38.560
ANY SPACE THAT WE CAN? THANK YOU

01:11:38.627 --> 01:11:41.664
FOR THAT. AND THANK YOU. YES. SO

01:11:41.730 --> 01:11:44.199
I JUST DID WANT TO MENTION THAT

01:11:44.266 --> 01:11:45.834
JENNICA HAS RECENTLY STARTED

01:11:45.901 --> 01:11:48.537
WORKING WITH HIGH SCHOOLS,

01:11:48.604 --> 01:11:49.805
SPECIFICALLY IN MY DISTRICT,

01:11:49.872 --> 01:11:51.206
BECAUSE I SHARED WITH YOU THAT

01:11:51.273 --> 01:11:52.675
THE YOUNG WOMAN WAS MURDERED IN

01:11:52.741 --> 01:11:54.309
THE SOUSA UNIFIED SCHOOL

01:11:54.376 --> 01:11:56.178
DISTRICT. SO THEY'RE IN

01:11:56.245 --> 01:11:56.812
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT. SHE'S

01:11:56.879 --> 01:11:58.747
IN WEST COVINA. SHE AND SHE'S

01:11:58.814 --> 01:12:02.051
ALSO A TRAINER FOR THE RAIDERS,

01:12:02.117 --> 01:12:03.786
BECAUSE WE SEE A LOT OF THE

01:12:03.852 --> 01:12:05.421
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ISSUES WITH

01:12:05.487 --> 01:12:07.156
THE SPORTS TEAMS, BECAUSE NOBODY

01:12:07.222 --> 01:12:08.524
TAUGHT THEM HOW TO, YOU KNOW,

01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:10.626
HAVE RELATIONSHIPS EITHER. AND I

01:12:10.693 --> 01:12:12.127
KNOW YOU'RE WORKING. YOU SAID UC

01:12:12.194 --> 01:12:13.862
SAN DIEGO IS GOING TO BRING YOU

01:12:13.929 --> 01:12:17.399
IN TO DO PART OF THE ORIENTATION

01:12:17.466 --> 01:12:18.867
IS THIS KIND OF TRAINING FOR

01:12:18.934 --> 01:12:21.136
THOSE ATHLETES, BECAUSE IF WE

01:12:21.203 --> 01:12:23.305
NEED TO ATTACK IT IN ALL FORMS.

01:12:23.372 --> 01:12:24.406
SO THANK YOU, JESSICA, AND I

01:12:24.473 --> 01:12:25.674

NEXT SPEAKER AND THEN HOPEFULLY

01:12:36.885 --> 01:12:38.420
WE'LL HAVE MORE TIME. BECAUSE I

01:12:38.487 --> 01:12:39.521
KNOW THE CONVERSATIONS ARE SO

01:12:39.588 --> 01:12:40.789
IMPORTANT AND THE QUESTIONS

01:12:40.856 --> 01:12:41.590
START INSTEAD OF DECREASING.

01:12:41.657 --> 01:12:43.459
WE'RE LIKE, OH MY GOD, WHAT

01:12:43.525 --> 01:12:44.426

SAY, I ALSO WANTED TO ADD FOR

01:12:54.369 --> 01:12:55.204
PARENTS VALOR HAS A CAR

01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:56.438
CONVERSATIONS GUIDE. IT IS AIMED

01:12:56.505 --> 01:13:00.709
AT CHILDREN BETWEEN 8 AND 14 VÀ.

01:13:00.776 --> 01:13:01.944
IT IS SOMETHING YOU CAN DOWNLOAD

01:13:02.010 --> 01:13:03.579
I BELIEVE IN ENGLISH OR IN

01:13:03.645 --> 01:13:05.380
SPANISH AND THEY ARE MEANT TO BE

01:13:05.447 --> 01:13:06.749
THOSE LITTLE QUIPS WHEN YOU HAVE

01:13:06.815 --> 01:13:09.384
YOUR KID IN THE BACK OF THE CAR

01:13:09.451 --> 01:13:11.253
OF LIKE HOW TO INTRODUCE A TOPIC

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:11.920
WITHOUT SOUNDING CHEESY FOR YOU

01:13:11.987 --> 01:13:13.655
TO SORT OF TOUCH BASE ON WHAT

01:13:13.722 --> 01:13:15.557
THEY'RE DOING AND WHAT THEIR

01:13:15.624 --> 01:13:16.191
FRIENDS ARE DOING. BECAUSE IF

01:13:16.258 --> 01:13:17.326
YOU WANT THE FOUNDATION TO BE

01:13:17.392 --> 01:13:19.461
ABLE TO HAVE A CHANCE AT

01:13:19.528 --> 01:13:20.429
SPEAKING WITH YOUR CHILD ABOUT

01:13:20.496 --> 01:13:22.331
THEIR DATING LIFE OR WHAT THEIR

01:13:22.397 --> 01:13:23.398
FRIENDS ARE DOING, YOU NEED TO

01:13:23.465 --> 01:13:24.399
START THOSE CONVERSATIONS BEFORE

01:13:24.466 --> 01:13:26.235
THOSE THINGS COME UP, RIGHT? THE

01:13:26.301 --> 01:13:27.569
OTHER RESOURCE I USE WITH

01:13:27.636 --> 01:13:29.404
FAMILIES WHO MIGHT NOT HAVE

01:13:29.471 --> 01:13:31.740
ACCESS TO ME IF THEY'RE NOT IN

01:13:31.807 --> 01:13:33.175
OUR DISTRICT OR OUR AREA, IS

01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:35.144
LOVE IS RESPECT. SO THAT IS THE

01:13:35.210 --> 01:13:38.480
NATIONAL TEEN DATING ABUSE

01:13:38.547 --> 01:13:39.648
DOMESTIC HOTLINE, BUT THEY ALSO

01:13:39.715 --> 01:13:41.784
HAVE AN INSTAGRAM. IT'S GOING TO

01:13:41.850 --> 01:13:42.785
BE AT LOVEISRESPECT OFFICIAL. IF

01:13:42.851 --> 01:13:44.820
YOU KNOW YOUR CHILD SPENDS A LOT

01:13:44.887 --> 01:13:46.421
OF TIME ON THEIR CELL PHONE ON

01:13:46.488 --> 01:13:47.856
INSTAGRAM, YOU CAN GO IN AND

01:13:47.923 --> 01:13:48.991
HAVE THEM FOLLOW ACCOUNTS THAT

01:13:49.057 --> 01:13:50.292
TALK ABOUT HEALTHY

01:13:50.359 --> 01:13:51.860
RELATIONSHIPS. SO WHEN THEY ARE

01:13:51.927 --> 01:13:52.728
BUSY SCROLLING, THEY FOLLOW.

01:13:52.795 --> 01:13:54.329
LOVE IS RESPECT. THEY FOLLOW.

01:13:54.396 --> 01:13:56.899
JOIN ONE LOVE SO THAT THAT

01:13:56.965 --> 01:13:58.267
CONTENT IS PART OF THEIR FEED.

01:13:58.333 --> 01:14:00.402
THEY FOLLOW THEIR LOCAL YOUTH

01:14:00.469 --> 01:14:01.670
CLINIC SO THAT THEY'RE SEEING

01:14:01.737 --> 01:14:02.871
THAT INFORMATION AS PART OF

01:14:02.938 --> 01:14:04.406
THEIR SCROLL. AND THE SAME CAN

01:14:04.473 --> 01:14:06.575
BE TRUE FOR STUFF ABOUT POSITIVE

01:14:06.642 --> 01:14:07.643
SELF-IMAGE, RIGHT? MAKING SURE

01:14:07.709 --> 01:14:08.777
THAT THEY KNOW THEY'RE SPENDING

01:14:08.844 --> 01:14:10.312
TIME ON THEIR PHONE, THAT NOT

01:14:10.379 --> 01:14:11.413
ONLY DO THEY UNFOLLOW STUFF THAT

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:13.048
DOESN'T MAKE THEM FEEL GOOD

01:14:13.115 --> 01:14:13.682
ABOUT THEMSELVES, BUT THAT YOU

01:14:13.749 --> 01:14:15.818
CAN ALSO PUT IN SOME FOLLOWS OF

01:14:15.884 --> 01:14:17.352
INFORMATION YOU WOULD LIKE THEM

01:14:17.419 --> 01:14:20.255
TO SEE. THANK YOU. AND GO AHEAD.

01:14:20.322 --> 01:14:20.923
YEAH, OTHERWISE I REALLY

01:14:20.989 --> 01:14:22.491
APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. THANK

01:14:22.558 --> 01:14:24.760

01:14:24.827 --> 01:14:25.594
TAYLOR. I'M THE YOUTH PREVENTION

COORDINATOR WITH REVOLT AGAINST

01:14:26.728 --> 01:14:28.931
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. I'M ALSO AN

01:14:28.997 --> 01:14:30.666
ADVISORY COUNCIL MEMBER FOR

01:14:30.732 --> 01:14:31.633
LOVEISRESPECT NATIONAL TEEN

01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:34.269
DATING VIOLENCE AND ABUSE

01:14:34.336 --> 01:14:36.772
HOTLINE. SO ACCORDING TO THE

01:14:36.839 --> 01:14:39.775
CDC. OH, SORRY. ARE BRILLIANT.

01:14:39.842 --> 01:14:42.978
ACCORDING TO THE CDC 2022 TEEN

01:14:43.045 --> 01:14:44.813
DATING VIOLENCE FACT SHEET OF

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:46.849
TEENS WHO ARE DATING IN THE LAST

01:14:46.915 --> 01:14:49.184
YEAR, 1 IN 12 HIGH SCHOOLERS

01:14:49.251 --> 01:14:50.018
REPORT THAT THEY EXPERIENCED

01:14:50.085 --> 01:14:51.920
PHYSICAL VIOLENCE AT THE HANDS

01:14:51.987 --> 01:14:53.689
OF THEIR PARTNER. 1 IN 12 HIGH

01:14:53.755 --> 01:14:54.590
SCHOOLERS WILL REPORT THAT THEY

01:14:54.656 --> 01:14:56.191
WERE SEXUALLY ABUSED BY THEIR

01:14:56.258 --> 01:14:58.293
PARTNER, AND ONLY 1 IN 3 WILL

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:00.195
REPORT THAT THEY HAVE TOLD ANY

01:15:00.262 --> 01:15:02.564
ADULT RIGHT FOR THAT STATISTIC.

01:15:02.631 --> 01:15:04.967
IT IS APPROXIMATELY, I THINK,

01:15:05.033 --> 01:15:05.834
THREE QUARTERS OF STUDENTS, AND

01:15:05.901 --> 01:15:07.502
I WILL GET YOU THE CITATION FOR

01:15:07.569 --> 01:15:09.805
THAT DID TELL A FRIEND, RIGHT?

01:15:09.872 --> 01:15:11.406
AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

01:15:11.473 --> 01:15:13.809
ARE ALL LEANING ON WHEN WE COME

01:15:13.876 --> 01:15:14.443
INTO CLASSROOMS IS THAT NONE OF

01:15:14.509 --> 01:15:15.811
US REMEMBER RESOURCES WHEN WE

01:15:15.878 --> 01:15:16.745
ARE OVERWHELMED, BUT THEIR

01:15:16.812 --> 01:15:19.548
FRIEND MIGHT. SO TEEN DATING

01:15:19.615 --> 01:15:21.483
VIOLENCE INCLUDES PHYSICAL,

01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:22.618
PSYCHOLOGICAL, OR SEXUAL ABUSE

01:15:22.684 --> 01:15:25.120
OR HARASSMENT OF ANY YOUTH 12 TO

01:15:25.187 --> 01:15:27.589
18. IN THE CONTEXT OF A PAST OR

01:15:27.656 --> 01:15:30.092
PRESENT DATING OR CONSENSUAL

01:15:30.158 --> 01:15:31.860
RELATIONSHIP, REVOLT AGAINST

01:15:31.927 --> 01:15:32.794
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS PROUD TO

01:15:32.861 --> 01:15:35.130
OFFER COMMUNITY AND SCHOOL BASED

01:15:35.197 --> 01:15:36.932
PREVENTION PRESENTATIONS ON

01:15:36.999 --> 01:15:38.033
HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS, TEEN

01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:39.902
DATING VIOLENCE 101 AND OUR MOST

01:15:39.968 --> 01:15:42.237
COMMON ONE AT THE MOMENT IS

01:15:42.304 --> 01:15:43.438
DIGITAL BOUNDARIES. SO A NOD TO

01:15:43.505 --> 01:15:45.507
THAT NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE

01:15:45.574 --> 01:15:48.143
ARE ONLINE, RIGHT, AND THAT

01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:49.945
YOUTH ARE NOT ABLE TO CHECK OFF

01:15:50.012 --> 01:15:51.880
OR TAKE TIME AWAY FROM

01:15:51.947 --> 01:15:52.581
FRIENDSHIPS OR DATING

01:15:52.648 --> 01:15:54.249
RELATIONSHIPS IN THE SAME WAY

01:15:54.316 --> 01:15:55.350
THAT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO.

01:15:55.417 --> 01:15:56.518
ON THAT NOTE, ONE OF MY MOST

01:15:56.585 --> 01:15:59.254
HANDED OUT RESOURCES IS TAKE IT

01:15:59.321 --> 01:16:00.422
DOWN. IT IS A RESOURCE WITH THE

01:16:00.489 --> 01:16:01.590
NATIONAL CENTER FOR MISSING AND

01:16:01.657 --> 01:16:02.925
EXPLOITED CHILDREN. IF YOU'RE IF

01:16:02.991 --> 01:16:04.660
THE YOUTH YOU ARE WORKING WITH

01:16:04.726 --> 01:16:07.195
HAVE TAKEN A SEXUAL VIDEO OR

01:16:07.262 --> 01:16:08.897
JUST A SEMINUDE IMAGE OR A

01:16:08.964 --> 01:16:10.699
SUGGESTED IMAGE OF THEMSELVES,

01:16:10.766 --> 01:16:11.867
AND THEY WERE UNDER 18 WHEN IT

01:16:11.934 --> 01:16:14.002
WAS TAKEN, THEY CAN UPLOAD IT TO

01:16:14.069 --> 01:16:15.771
HAVE IT TAKEN DOWN. THIS IS

01:16:15.837 --> 01:16:18.240
WHERE, AS A PARENT, YOU NOW NEED

01:16:18.307 --> 01:16:19.541
TO TELL YOUR CHILD THAT IF THEY

01:16:19.608 --> 01:16:20.976
TAKE A SEXUAL VIDEO OR PHOTO, OR

01:16:21.043 --> 01:16:22.711
THEIR PARTNER TAKES ONE OF THEM,

01:16:22.778 --> 01:16:23.812
THEY NEED TO SEND IT TO

01:16:23.879 --> 01:16:25.480
THEMSELVES BECAUSE I CANNOT HAVE

01:16:25.547 --> 01:16:28.250
THEM TAG IT TO HAVE IT REMOVED

01:16:28.317 --> 01:16:29.484
ANONYMOUSLY. IF THEY DO NOT HAVE

01:16:29.551 --> 01:16:31.119
A COPY OF THAT VIDEO OR IMAGE,

01:16:31.186 --> 01:16:33.388
WHICH IS A BIT OF A DIFFERENT

01:16:33.455 --> 01:16:33.956
CONVERSATION A PARENT THAN

01:16:34.022 --> 01:16:35.357
SAYING, PLEASE DON'T TAKE IT

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:37.726
RIGHT. I ALSO WANT TO NOD THAT

01:16:37.793 --> 01:16:39.494
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

01:16:39.561 --> 01:16:42.097
CALIFORNIA HEALTHY YOUTH ACT, WE

01:16:42.164 --> 01:16:44.099
GO INTO SCHOOLS AND TALK TO THEM

01:16:44.166 --> 01:16:45.701
ABOUT SOCIAL EMOTIONAL

01:16:45.767 --> 01:16:46.702
EDUCATION. VERY SIMILAR. ALSO

01:16:46.768 --> 01:16:49.004
TALKING ABOUT SIGNS FOR CONSENT

01:16:49.071 --> 01:16:50.272
AND TEEN DATING VIOLENCE

01:16:50.339 --> 01:16:51.807
AWARENESS. AND THOSE ARE RIGHTS

01:16:51.873 --> 01:16:53.408
THAT YOUR STUDENTS ARE TO HAVE

01:16:53.475 --> 01:16:55.010
IN MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH

01:16:55.077 --> 01:16:57.145
SCHOOL. AND FORMERLY WITH CAL

01:16:57.212 --> 01:16:59.648
OES, WE WERE ABLE TO BUILD

01:16:59.715 --> 01:17:00.115
RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE

01:17:00.182 --> 01:17:01.583
UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO AT

01:17:01.650 --> 01:17:02.684
SAN FRANCISCO STATE, WHICH ARE

01:17:02.751 --> 01:17:04.353
IN OUR SAN FRANCISCO CITY AND

01:17:04.419 --> 01:17:05.854
COUNTY, BUT ALSO SKYLINE AND CAL

01:17:05.921 --> 01:17:07.756
STATE EAST BAY, WHERE WE'VE

01:17:07.823 --> 01:17:09.124
LAUNCHED A THREE PART LOVE

01:17:09.191 --> 01:17:10.525
SERIES WITH OUR COLLEGE STUDENTS

01:17:10.592 --> 01:17:12.294
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TALK ABOUT

01:17:12.361 --> 01:17:13.595
WHAT LOVE IS AND ALSO WHAT LOVE

01:17:13.662 --> 01:17:15.530
IS WHEN YOU ARE NOT LIVING AT

01:17:15.597 --> 01:17:17.432
HOME FOR THE FIRST TIME. SO WE

01:17:17.499 --> 01:17:19.334
ALL KNOW DORM LOVE IS A LITTLE

01:17:19.401 --> 01:17:20.202
BIT DIFFERENT THAN HIGH SCHOOL

01:17:20.268 --> 01:17:22.070
DATING. THE HEART OF OUR

01:17:22.137 --> 01:17:22.904
INTERVENTION EFFORTS ARE OUR

01:17:22.971 --> 01:17:24.439
YOUTH ADVISORY COUNCIL. SO WE

01:17:24.506 --> 01:17:27.376
INVITE YOUTH 18 TO 24 TO LEARN

01:17:27.442 --> 01:17:28.043
ABOUT HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS, AND

01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:29.277
THEY SERVE AS AMBASSADORS, BOTH

01:17:29.344 --> 01:17:30.612
AS NEAR PEERS FOR MY MIDDLE

01:17:30.679 --> 01:17:32.214
SCHOOLERS AND HIGH SCHOOLERS.

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:34.249
BECAUSE WHAT I HAVE TO SAY IS

01:17:34.316 --> 01:17:35.417
NOWHERE NEAR AS COOL AS WHAT MY

01:17:35.484 --> 01:17:37.919
COLLEGE STUDENTS HAVE TO SAY,

01:17:37.986 --> 01:17:38.954
AND ALSO AMBASSADORS ON THEIR

01:17:39.021 --> 01:17:40.622
CAMPUS ON WHEN THEIR FRIENDS

01:17:40.689 --> 01:17:42.157
MIGHT NEED A BREAKUP PLAN AND

01:17:42.224 --> 01:17:43.992
WHEN THEY MIGHT NEED A SAFETY

01:17:44.059 --> 01:17:45.127
PLAN, AND WHERE TO GET

01:17:45.193 --> 01:17:45.927
ASSISTANCE ON AND OFF CAMPUS.

01:17:45.994 --> 01:17:47.729
THAT IS CONFIDENTIAL, BECAUSE

01:17:47.796 --> 01:17:49.097
OFTEN THEY DO NOT WANT THEIR

01:17:49.164 --> 01:17:51.533
SCHOOL TO BE AWARE OF WHAT'S

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.001
GOING ON, OR FOR IT TO AFFECT

01:17:53.068 --> 01:17:54.403
THEIR ACADEMICS THE SAME WAY

01:17:54.469 --> 01:17:56.004
THAT YOU DON'T WANT YOUR PARENTS

01:17:56.071 --> 01:17:57.773
NECESSARILY TO KNOW. SOMETIMES

01:17:57.839 --> 01:17:58.940
OUR PREVENTION AND AWARENESS

01:17:59.007 --> 01:18:02.077
EFFORTS COME TOO LATE. OUR YOUTH

01:18:02.144 --> 01:18:03.211
ADVISORY COUNCIL UNDER KENDALL

01:18:03.278 --> 01:18:04.780
HAD A PREVENTION PRESENTATION

01:18:04.846 --> 01:18:07.082
SCHEDULED WITH ZETA PHI BETA

01:18:07.149 --> 01:18:09.518
SORORITY IN SPRING 2024. IT

01:18:09.584 --> 01:18:10.919
HAPPENED TO BE ON THE SAME NIGHT

01:18:10.986 --> 01:18:12.754
I WAS ON CAMPUS FOR A MEMORIAL

01:18:12.821 --> 01:18:15.991
FOR A STUDENT WHO WAS KILLED BY

01:18:16.058 --> 01:18:18.927
HER BOYFRIEND IN HIS HOME.

01:18:18.994 --> 01:18:20.395
THERE'S ALSO A SCHOLARSHIP AT

01:18:20.462 --> 01:18:21.630
SAN FRANCISCO STATE, AND THERE

01:18:21.696 --> 01:18:24.933
MAY BE FOR A COLLEGE NEAR YOU IN

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.335
MEMORY OF ARIANNA MAYHUGH, WHO

01:18:27.402 --> 01:18:29.104
WAS A STUDENT WHO ALSO LOST HER

01:18:29.171 --> 01:18:30.939
LIFE AT THE HANDS OF A FORMER

01:18:31.006 --> 01:18:32.941
PARTNER. WITH FEDERAL CHANGES,

01:18:33.008 --> 01:18:33.742
IT'S MORE IMPORTANT NOW THAN

01:18:33.809 --> 01:18:35.844
EVER THAT CALIFORNIA YOUTH HAVE

01:18:35.911 --> 01:18:36.578
ACCESS TO ACCURATE INFORMATION

01:18:36.645 --> 01:18:38.713
ON HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS,

01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:39.781
CONSENT. DATING, DOMESTIC

01:18:39.848 --> 01:18:41.283
VIOLENCE, AND HOW TO RECOGNIZE

01:18:41.349 --> 01:18:42.384
THE SIGNS OF AN ABUSIVE

01:18:42.451 --> 01:18:44.386
RELATIONSHIP BEFORE IT STARTS.

01:18:44.453 --> 01:18:45.887
EMPOWERING YOUTH IS ONE OF THE

01:18:45.954 --> 01:18:47.355
CORE EFFORTS OF OUR PROGRAM, SO

01:18:47.422 --> 01:18:48.657
WE'RE REALLY PROUD TO BE ABLE TO

01:18:48.723 --> 01:18:51.059
WORK WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO

01:18:51.126 --> 01:18:53.128
YOUTH COMMISSIONERS. SO 2024, IN

01:18:53.195 --> 01:18:54.496
FEBRUARY IS RECOGNIZED AS TEEN

01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:55.630
DATING VIOLENCE AWARENESS AND

01:18:55.697 --> 01:18:57.065
PREVENTION MONTH. OUR YOUTH

01:18:57.132 --> 01:18:58.100
COMMISSIONER IS ACTUALLY WROTE

01:18:58.166 --> 01:19:01.069
THEIR OWN PROCLAMATION IN

01:19:01.136 --> 01:19:03.738
RECOGNITION OF THAT, AND PASSED

01:19:03.805 --> 01:19:05.740
THAT THROUGH AND BROUGHT IT TO

01:19:05.807 --> 01:19:07.109
THEIR SUPERVISORS. THEY'VE DONE

01:19:07.175 --> 01:19:10.345
THAT AGAIN IN 2025. SO THE

01:19:10.412 --> 01:19:12.914
INITIAL BUT JUST GETTING THAT TO

01:19:12.981 --> 01:19:13.748
BE PART OF THEIR LEGISLATIVE

01:19:13.815 --> 01:19:14.649
IDENTITY, SO THAT IF THEY

01:19:14.716 --> 01:19:16.751
CONTINUE ON IN LAW OR THEY

01:19:16.818 --> 01:19:17.853
CONTINUE ON IN TEACHING, THAT

01:19:17.919 --> 01:19:19.387
THEY SEE THE WORDS DOMESTIC

01:19:19.454 --> 01:19:21.289
VIOLENCE IN A HEARING AND A

01:19:21.356 --> 01:19:22.390
MOTION AND A BILL, AND THEY

01:19:22.457 --> 01:19:24.459
DON'T THINK IT'S SO BIG AND SO

01:19:24.526 --> 01:19:25.627
SCARY THAT THEY CAN'T TOUCH IT,

01:19:25.694 --> 01:19:26.828
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THE OTHER

01:19:26.895 --> 01:19:28.363
THING THAT HAPPENS IS IT FEELS

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:30.198
LIKE SOMETHING THAT'S SO BIG

01:19:30.265 --> 01:19:31.199
THAT PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO SAY

01:19:31.266 --> 01:19:33.435
THE WRONG THING. YEAH. THANK

01:19:33.502 --> 01:19:36.304
YOU. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS?

01:19:36.371 --> 01:19:38.473
WELL, FUNNY, YOU MENTIONED SAN

01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:39.908

01:19:39.975 --> 01:19:41.710
TO BE A FRESHMAN IN THE FALL.

01:19:41.776 --> 01:19:43.478
AND SO I'LL BE SURE TO CONTACT

01:19:43.545 --> 01:19:45.647
YOU. YOU KNOW, I THINK LIKE I

01:19:45.714 --> 01:19:49.951
SAID, AS A PARENT I'M ALWAYS

01:19:50.018 --> 01:19:50.619
WORRIED FOR KIDS. AND I KNOW ALL

01:19:50.685 --> 01:19:55.390
OF US ARE SO ON ON THAT I DIDN'T

01:19:55.457 --> 01:19:57.425
REALLY GET TO TALK ABOUT YOUR

01:19:57.492 --> 01:20:01.062
BIO. SO HOW DID YOU GET STARTED?

01:20:01.129 --> 01:20:05.700
I HAVE A BACKGROUND IN SEXUAL

01:20:05.767 --> 01:20:08.036
ABUSE, SORRY, AND SEXUAL HEALTH

01:20:08.103 --> 01:20:09.404
EDUCATION AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE

01:20:09.471 --> 01:20:10.639
PREVENTION FROM CITY COLLEGE OF

01:20:10.705 --> 01:20:12.440
SAN FRANCISCO, WHERE I WAS A

01:20:12.507 --> 01:20:13.708
PEER EDUCATOR FOR THEIR EXPECT

01:20:13.775 --> 01:20:16.278
RESPECT PROGRAM. BUT IN

01:20:16.344 --> 01:20:18.246
RETROSPECT, I WAS DRAWN TO THE

01:20:18.313 --> 01:20:19.948
WORK BECAUSE I HAD A SEATMATE IN

01:20:20.015 --> 01:20:20.949
HIGH SCHOOL WHO HAD A

01:20:21.016 --> 01:20:21.950
RESTRAINING ORDER THAT OUR

01:20:22.017 --> 01:20:24.319
PRINCIPAL DID NOT ENFORCE, AND

01:20:24.386 --> 01:20:25.921
SO HE WAS ABLE TO ACCESS HER

01:20:25.987 --> 01:20:27.756
EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS 18 AND HE

01:20:27.822 --> 01:20:29.524
WAS 17, INSIDE THE SCHOOL

01:20:29.591 --> 01:20:31.092
BUILDING. AND IT WAS SOMETHING

01:20:31.159 --> 01:20:33.461
THAT WE HAD TO NAVIGATE AS HER

01:20:33.528 --> 01:20:35.297
CLASSMATES. YEAH. THANK YOU. MR.

01:20:35.363 --> 01:20:36.898

QUESTION. WELL, THANK YOU VERY

01:20:38.366 --> 01:20:39.467
MUCH FOR APPEARING. REALLY

01:20:39.534 --> 01:20:42.337
APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY.

01:20:42.404 --> 01:20:44.206
WHAT ONE THING OR TWO THINGS

01:20:44.272 --> 01:20:47.242
WOULD YOU LIKE FOR US TO KNOW AS

01:20:47.309 --> 01:20:51.246
LEGISLATORS THAT WOULD, BY WAY

01:20:51.313 --> 01:20:55.183
OF POLICY, HELP THAT WE SHOULD

01:20:55.250 --> 01:20:58.420
CONSIDER TO TRY TO MAKE SURE

01:20:58.486 --> 01:21:00.922
THAT OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE ARE

01:21:00.989 --> 01:21:04.626
PROTECTED? I THINK THOSE TWO

01:21:04.693 --> 01:21:07.028
THINGS I WOULD THINK OF FOR ONE,

01:21:07.095 --> 01:21:08.196
THAT ORIGINAL CAL OES FUNDING

01:21:08.263 --> 01:21:10.465
THAT WE HAD NO LONGER EXISTS.

01:21:10.532 --> 01:21:12.500
RIGHT? SO PREVENTION FUNDING

01:21:12.567 --> 01:21:13.802
CAN'T JUST BE SOMETHING WE FUND

01:21:13.868 --> 01:21:15.670
FOR TWO YEARS AND THEN WE STOP.

01:21:15.737 --> 01:21:17.672
THERE ARE NEW MIDDLE SCHOOLERS

01:21:17.739 --> 01:21:18.540
AND HIGH SCHOOLERS EVERY FALL.

01:21:18.607 --> 01:21:19.941
THEY ALL DESERVE ACCESS TO THAT

01:21:20.008 --> 01:21:21.409
INFORMATION ON HEALTHY

01:21:21.476 --> 01:21:22.844
RELATIONSHIPS. SO MAKING SURE

01:21:22.911 --> 01:21:24.980
THAT THAT'S CONSTANT. RIGHT. AND

01:21:25.046 --> 01:21:26.848
HOW MUCH WAS THAT FUNDING? I

01:21:26.915 --> 01:21:28.450
WILL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON

01:21:28.516 --> 01:21:31.453
THAT. THANK YOU. MY EXECUTIVE

01:21:31.519 --> 01:21:32.554
DIRECTOR CAN ANSWER THAT

01:21:32.621 --> 01:21:34.456
QUESTION WHEN SHE'S UP NEXT. THE

01:21:34.522 --> 01:21:37.192
OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT

01:21:37.259 --> 01:21:39.394
WE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE WRITTEN IN

01:21:39.461 --> 01:21:41.496
ALLOWANCES FOR EDUCATION ON

01:21:41.563 --> 01:21:42.264
CONSENT AND TEEN DATING

01:21:42.330 --> 01:21:43.832
VIOLENCE. THEY ARE PART OF THE

01:21:43.898 --> 01:21:45.033
CALIFORNIA HEALTHY YOUTH ACT.

01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:46.768
AND WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT THAT

01:21:46.835 --> 01:21:48.436
IS IN PRACTICE AND STUDENTS HAVE

01:21:48.503 --> 01:21:50.205
ACCESS TO THAT EDUCATION

01:21:50.272 --> 01:21:51.406
INFORMATION, EVEN WHEN A LOT OF

01:21:51.473 --> 01:21:52.841
THAT FEDERAL FUNDING THAT COMES

01:21:52.907 --> 01:21:54.976
THROUGH TO DO THE WORK CAN ACT

01:21:55.043 --> 01:21:56.378
IN A SILENCING CAPACITY. IF

01:21:56.444 --> 01:21:57.445
CALIFORNIA HAS RECOGNIZED THAT

01:21:57.512 --> 01:21:59.214
YOUTH NEED ACCESS TO THAT

01:21:59.281 --> 01:22:00.181
INFORMATION, WE NEED TO ENSURE

01:22:00.248 --> 01:22:01.583
THAT OUR STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO

01:22:01.650 --> 01:22:03.285
THAT INFORMATION. YES. BUT I

01:22:03.351 --> 01:22:05.387
GUESS THE QUESTION WOULD BE IS

01:22:05.453 --> 01:22:06.254
WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE?

01:22:06.321 --> 01:22:07.789
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I SHARED

01:22:07.856 --> 01:22:08.957
EARLIER THAT WE'RE WE'RE IN SUCH

01:22:09.024 --> 01:22:10.325
A PROTECTIVE MODE AT THE MOMENT

01:22:10.392 --> 01:22:11.826
THAT, YOU KNOW, WE DON'T TRUST

01:22:11.893 --> 01:22:13.662
THAT THE EITHER THE PARENTS OR

01:22:13.728 --> 01:22:14.329
THE SCHOOL SYSTEM, AND

01:22:14.396 --> 01:22:15.330
ESPECIALLY NOT THE LEGISLATORS

01:22:15.397 --> 01:22:17.632
ARE DOING THE WHAT'S BEST, YOU

01:22:17.699 --> 01:22:19.234
KNOW, BECAUSE THEY'RE MY KIDS,

01:22:19.301 --> 01:22:20.869
RIGHT? IT'S MY CHILD. WHO ARE

01:22:20.935 --> 01:22:24.406
YOU? SO HOW. BECAUSE IT'S

01:22:24.472 --> 01:22:26.875
ALREADY IN THE YOUTH ACT. SO

01:22:26.941 --> 01:22:29.811
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE

01:22:29.878 --> 01:22:32.013
ROADBLOCK FOR THE SCHOOLS FROM

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:33.515
FROM ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT IT

01:22:33.581 --> 01:22:36.217
OR ENFORCING IT? CHEN I THINK

01:22:36.284 --> 01:22:38.086
WHAT WHAT I'VE SEEN IS THAT THEY

01:22:38.153 --> 01:22:41.122
THINK THEY COVER IT BY JUST

01:22:41.189 --> 01:22:43.892
HAVING THAT CHAPTER, AND THAT'S

01:22:43.958 --> 01:22:46.328
NOT REALLY COVERING IT. THE

01:22:46.394 --> 01:22:47.896
STUDENTS NEED THIS MORE THAN

01:22:47.962 --> 01:22:50.699
JUST LIKE ONE TIME A YEAR IN A

01:22:50.765 --> 01:22:53.268
BRIEF ONE 30 MINUTE

01:22:53.335 --> 01:22:54.402
CONVERSATION. IT REALLY NEEDS TO

01:22:54.469 --> 01:22:56.771
BE INCORPORATED INTO THE

01:22:56.838 --> 01:22:57.972
CURRICULUM, JUST LIKE IT'S A

01:22:58.039 --> 01:23:00.508
MATH OR SCIENCE SUBJECT, THAT

01:23:00.575 --> 01:23:01.943
THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE IT NEEDS

01:23:02.010 --> 01:23:03.745
TO BE SOMETHING THAT IS

01:23:03.812 --> 01:23:05.814
INGRAINED VERY EARLY ON TALKING

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.549
ABOUT WHAT HEALTHY BOUNDARIES

01:23:07.615 --> 01:23:09.451
ARE. HEALTHY FRIENDSHIP BECAUSE

01:23:09.517 --> 01:23:11.353
MANY YOUNG KIDS, KINDERGARTNERS,

01:23:11.419 --> 01:23:13.054
FIRST GRADERS THEY MAY NOT

01:23:13.121 --> 01:23:14.456
UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THEY MAY COME

01:23:14.522 --> 01:23:15.890
FROM HOMES WHERE THEY'VE SEEN

01:23:15.957 --> 01:23:17.459
THINGS. AND SO THEN WE START TO

01:23:17.525 --> 01:23:19.494
SEE BULLYING. WE START TO SEE

01:23:19.561 --> 01:23:20.695
KIDS WHO ARE COMING FROM HOMES,

01:23:20.762 --> 01:23:21.730
WHO ARE THE BULLIES, AND ALSO

01:23:21.796 --> 01:23:23.598
THE KIDS WHO YOU KNOW ARE THE

01:23:23.665 --> 01:23:25.367
ONES BEING BULLIED. WE KNOW THAT

01:23:25.433 --> 01:23:27.235
THAT IS LINKED TO DOMESTIC

01:23:27.302 --> 01:23:28.837
VIOLENCE. AND SO I THINK IT

01:23:28.903 --> 01:23:29.871
REALLY NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING

01:23:29.938 --> 01:23:31.906
THAT IS INCORPORATED EARLY ON.

01:23:31.973 --> 01:23:34.242
IT DOESN'T NEED TO HAPPEN IN

01:23:34.309 --> 01:23:35.110
JUNIOR HIGH AND HIGH SCHOOL.

01:23:35.176 --> 01:23:36.478
THEY'RE ALREADY ESTABLISHING

01:23:36.544 --> 01:23:37.345
FRIENDSHIPS IN KINDERGARTEN

01:23:37.412 --> 01:23:38.680
WHERE THEY'RE LIKE, I DON'T WANT

01:23:38.747 --> 01:23:40.582
YOU TO PLAY WITH THAT PERSON. I

01:23:40.648 --> 01:23:42.517
DON'T WANT YOU TO PLAY WITH THAT

01:23:42.584 --> 01:23:44.386
PERSON. AND JUST HELPING KIDS TO

01:23:44.452 --> 01:23:45.053
UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE LOOK LIKE.

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:47.389
IT'S OKAY THAT WE ALL PLAY

01:23:47.455 --> 01:23:48.390
TOGETHER. IT'S OKAY TO HAVE

01:23:48.456 --> 01:23:49.391
FRIENDS, YOU KNOW, AND

01:23:49.457 --> 01:23:50.358
UNDERSTANDING WHAT THAT LOOKS

01:23:50.425 --> 01:23:51.926
LIKE. I THINK SOMETIMES IT GETS

01:23:51.993 --> 01:23:52.694
LIKE, OH, LET'S TELL THEM LATER

01:23:52.761 --> 01:23:54.229
WHEN THEY'RE OLDER AND

01:23:54.295 --> 01:23:55.530
UNDERSTAND. BUT JUST LIKE

01:23:55.597 --> 01:23:56.931
LEARNING YOUR COLORS, YOU CAN

01:23:56.998 --> 01:23:58.032
STILL TEACH A KID WHAT IT MEANS

01:23:58.099 --> 01:23:59.634
TO BE KIND AND RESPECTFUL AND

01:23:59.701 --> 01:24:02.070
HONEST. THANK YOU. YEAH. NO NO.

01:24:02.137 --> 01:24:04.873

01:24:04.939 --> 01:24:09.177
YOU. YES. GO AHEAD I JUST WANT

01:24:09.244 --> 01:24:11.346
TO THANK TAYLOR FOR EVERY TIME I

SEE YOU. I'M SO INSPIRED. I

01:24:12.714 --> 01:24:14.449
MEAN, WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH

01:24:14.516 --> 01:24:16.317
BLACK WOMEN REVOLT. AND THEN THE

01:24:16.384 --> 01:24:18.586
RESOLUTION THAT WAS AUTHORED BY

01:24:18.653 --> 01:24:19.988
ASSEMBLYWOMAN RUBIO ON TEEN

01:24:20.054 --> 01:24:21.823
DATING VIOLENCE, I WAS ABLE TO

01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:23.458
COAUTHOR THAT. THANK YOU. AND

01:24:23.525 --> 01:24:24.526
REALLY RECOGNIZE THE SAN

01:24:24.592 --> 01:24:25.760
FRANCISCO YOUTH COMMISSION FOR

01:24:25.827 --> 01:24:26.561
EVERYTHING THEY'RE DOING AROUND

01:24:26.628 --> 01:24:29.397
THIS. AND I JUST WANT TO, AGAIN,

01:24:29.464 --> 01:24:31.166
CALL THAT, CALL THAT OUT,

01:24:31.232 --> 01:24:32.700
BECAUSE EVERY TIME I MEET WITH

01:24:32.767 --> 01:24:33.668
THE YOUTH COMMISSION IN SAN

01:24:33.735 --> 01:24:35.537
FRANCISCO, THEY HAVE EVEN MORE

01:24:35.603 --> 01:24:37.071
IDEAS FOR US. AND I THINK THIS

01:24:37.138 --> 01:24:38.706
EMPHASIS ON MAKING SURE THIS

01:24:38.773 --> 01:24:41.576
EDUCATION IS NOT JUST FUNDED FOR

01:24:41.643 --> 01:24:43.077
TWO YEARS, IT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:24:43.144 --> 01:24:44.746
NEEDS TO BE FUNDED, LIKE

01:24:44.813 --> 01:24:45.447
MATHEMATICS, LIKE, YOU KNOW,

01:24:45.513 --> 01:24:47.315
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED

01:24:47.382 --> 01:24:49.184
TO BE TEACHING FROM A VERY EARLY

01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:51.753
AGE WITH CONSISTENT FUNDING UP

01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:54.456
THROUGH COLLEGE. SO I ANYTHING I

01:24:54.522 --> 01:24:55.623
CAN DO TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THAT,

01:24:55.690 --> 01:24:58.359
I HAVE TO RUN TO EDGY REALLY

SO MUCH. APPRECIATE THAT. AND

01:25:01.095 --> 01:25:03.598
YES, YOU KNOW, GOING BACK TO THE

01:25:03.665 --> 01:25:04.799
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE WORK THAT

01:25:04.866 --> 01:25:07.936
YOU ALL DO, I THINK SOMETIMES IT

01:25:08.002 --> 01:25:10.472
FEELS LIKE YOU'RE FIGHTING THIS,

01:25:10.538 --> 01:25:11.806
THIS FIGHT ON YOUR OWN. AND

01:25:11.873 --> 01:25:13.608
THERE'S JUST NO THAT THERE'S A

01:25:13.675 --> 01:25:16.177
LOT OF US THAT ARE HERE NOW, AS

01:25:16.244 --> 01:25:18.279
YOU CAN SEE FROM OUR SCHEDULES,

01:25:18.346 --> 01:25:19.747
EVERYBODY'S RUNNING AROUND. I

01:25:19.814 --> 01:25:23.318
CALL IT PING PONG, BUT. BUT YOU

01:25:23.384 --> 01:25:25.954
HAVE AN INCREDIBLE LEGISLATOR IN

01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:28.556
YOUR AREA, AND, YOU KNOW, PLEASE

01:25:28.623 --> 01:25:31.226
REACH OUT. EVEN IF YOU THINK,

01:25:31.292 --> 01:25:32.494
LOOK, THE BUDGET IS WHAT IT IS

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:34.295
RIGHT NOW. SO THE EXCUSE IS

01:25:34.362 --> 01:25:35.964
ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE BUDGET.

01:25:36.030 --> 01:25:37.098
HOWEVER, I THINK THAT THERE'S

01:25:37.165 --> 01:25:39.267
OTHER THINGS LIKE THE, THE, THE,

01:25:39.334 --> 01:25:41.369
THE YOUTH ACT THAT IS ALREADY IN

01:25:41.436 --> 01:25:43.404
PLACE. AND SO AS A TEACHER, I

01:25:43.471 --> 01:25:45.707
CAN TELL YOU WE DON'T NEED EXTRA

01:25:45.773 --> 01:25:47.108
FUNDING, WE JUST NEED TIME TO

01:25:47.175 --> 01:25:48.443
ACTUALLY DO THAT WORK. AND TO

01:25:48.510 --> 01:25:52.113
YOUR POINT, JENNICA READING, YOU

01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:53.515
KNOW, READING ABOUT IT AND

01:25:53.581 --> 01:25:54.983
CHECKING THE BOX IS NOT

01:25:55.049 --> 01:25:56.551
EDUCATION. IT'S MORE OF A YOU'RE

01:25:56.618 --> 01:25:58.253
CHECKING THE BOX BECAUSE IT'S

01:25:58.319 --> 01:25:59.621
REQUIRED AS OPPOSED TO ACTUALLY

01:25:59.687 --> 01:26:01.489
PUTTING SOME EMPHASIS IN IT. SO

01:26:01.556 --> 01:26:03.258
MAYBE WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT

01:26:03.324 --> 01:26:07.262
MONEY, MAYBE THE, THE

01:26:07.328 --> 01:26:08.696
CONVERSATION SHOULD BE ABOUT HOW

01:26:08.763 --> 01:26:10.965
DO WE I DON'T WANT TO CALL IT

01:26:11.032 --> 01:26:12.400
ENFORCEMENT, BUT HOW DO WE

01:26:12.467 --> 01:26:13.368
ASSURE THAT SCHOOLS ARE HAVING

01:26:13.434 --> 01:26:14.469
THESE CONVERSATIONS? BECAUSE WE

01:26:14.536 --> 01:26:17.005
SEE A LOT OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:26:17.071 --> 01:26:19.107
AND TEEN VIOLENCE. WE TALK ABOUT

01:26:19.173 --> 01:26:21.676
IT. BUT, YOU KNOW, IT FEELS LIKE

01:26:21.743 --> 01:26:23.411
THEY'RE ISOLATED INCIDENTS AND

01:26:23.478 --> 01:26:25.246
THEY'RE NOT, YOU KNOW, TO YOUR

01:26:25.313 --> 01:26:27.448
POINT, WHEN YOU SEE KIDS, THEY

01:26:27.515 --> 01:26:29.751
HAVE EXPERIENCE. AND YOU SAID IT

01:26:29.817 --> 01:26:31.719
AS WELL. MANY KIDS HAVE ALREADY

01:26:31.786 --> 01:26:32.854
EXPERIENCED IT. THEY JUST DON'T

01:26:32.921 --> 01:26:34.656
KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. AND HOW DO

01:26:34.722 --> 01:26:36.357
WE GET TO THAT POINT. SO THANK

01:26:36.424 --> 01:26:39.661
YOU. GOOD. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS

01:26:39.727 --> 01:26:42.230
OKAY. WELL THANK YOU I WILL JUST

01:26:42.297 --> 01:26:43.698
FOR THE INTEREST OF TIME, IF YOU

01:26:43.765 --> 01:26:45.700
WOULD LIKE TO SIT HERE AND I'LL

01:26:45.767 --> 01:26:47.201
BRING OUR OTHER PANELISTS UP AND

01:26:47.268 --> 01:26:48.536
WE'LL START THAT CONVERSATION

01:26:48.603 --> 01:26:50.471
AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN START A

01:26:50.538 --> 01:26:51.573
CONVERSATION BETWEEN ALL OF US.

01:26:51.639 --> 01:26:53.308
IF NOT, YOU KNOW, I REALLY

01:26:53.374 --> 01:26:54.742
APPRECIATE IT, BUT IF YOU

01:26:54.809 --> 01:26:55.910
WOULDN'T MIND JUST STANDING

01:26:55.977 --> 01:26:58.212
THERE OR IF YOU WANT TO GO BACK.

01:26:58.279 --> 01:26:59.080
YEAH. YEAH. OKAY. PERFECT. YES.

01:26:59.147 --> 01:27:01.149
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

01:27:01.215 --> 01:27:01.883
TO HAVE A FLUID CONVERSATION.

01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:08.890
YOU CAN ALL SIT HERE. YES, YES.

01:27:08.957 --> 01:27:11.292
SO THE SECOND PANEL, THE SECOND

01:27:11.359 --> 01:27:12.961
PANEL, WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS

SURVIVOR OR SURVIVOR, DOMESTIC

01:30:07.368 --> 01:30:08.503
VIOLENCE THAT REALLY NEEDS TO

GET INTO A PLACE RIGHT NOW AND

01:30:10.605 --> 01:30:11.606
THEN THOSE ONGOING SERVICES. SO

01:30:11.672 --> 01:30:13.474
WE PROVIDE THEM TO THEM.

01:30:13.541 --> 01:30:14.709
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, AS YOU ALL

01:30:14.776 --> 01:30:16.110
KNOW, IS ABOUT POWER AND

01:30:16.177 --> 01:30:19.247
CONTROL. SOMEONE MENTIONED ABOUT

01:30:19.313 --> 01:30:21.015
THE ASSEMBLYMAN OVER THERE

01:30:21.082 --> 01:30:23.017
TALKED ABOUT STAYING OR LEAVING,

01:30:23.084 --> 01:30:24.452
AND IT'S REALLY NOT ABOUT

01:30:24.519 --> 01:30:25.653
STAYING OR LEAVING. QUITE OFTEN.

01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:27.588
IT'S ABOUT LIVING OR DYING, YOU

01:30:27.655 --> 01:30:29.423
KNOW, AND THEN WHEN YOU HAVE

01:30:29.490 --> 01:30:31.125
KIDS, IT JUST ADDS TO THAT.

01:30:31.192 --> 01:30:32.527
BREAKING THAT CYCLE OF VIOLENCE

01:30:32.593 --> 01:30:34.262
IS REALLY HARD. I KNOW IN YOUR

01:30:34.328 --> 01:30:35.463
CONVERSATION YOU WERE TALKING

01:30:35.530 --> 01:30:37.064
ABOUT, HOW DO WE BREAK THAT

01:30:37.131 --> 01:30:39.400
CYCLE FOR OUR TEENS? YOU KNOW,

01:30:39.467 --> 01:30:40.768
YOU GOT TO GET THROUGH THAT

01:30:40.835 --> 01:30:42.370
DENIAL. SO HOW DO YOU GET

01:30:42.436 --> 01:30:44.405
THROUGH THAT DENIAL WHEN IT'S

01:30:44.472 --> 01:30:46.741
TRYING TO BREAK THE FANTASY FROM

01:30:46.808 --> 01:30:48.476
THE REALITY OF WHAT IT IS? SO

01:30:48.543 --> 01:30:50.678
HOW DO YOU DO THAT? SO WE WORK

01:30:50.745 --> 01:30:52.380
WITH OUR KIDS ON THAT. AS MANY

01:30:52.446 --> 01:30:53.614
OF YOU, YOU KNOW THAT CHILDREN,

01:30:53.681 --> 01:30:55.883
WHEN THEY REACT TO DOMESTIC

01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:57.418
VIOLENCE, YOU KNOW, THEY OFTEN

01:30:57.485 --> 01:30:59.554
ACT OUT, THEY'VE WITHDRAWN, THEY

01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:02.056
SHOW SIGNS OF ANXIETY OR

01:31:02.123 --> 01:31:03.124
DEPRESSION, MAYBE HAVE SOME

01:31:03.191 --> 01:31:04.992
SLEEP ISSUES. THEY OFTEN

01:31:05.059 --> 01:31:06.794
STRUGGLE IN SCHOOL, DEVELOP

01:31:06.861 --> 01:31:08.262
TRUST ISSUES, OR THEY BECOME

01:31:08.329 --> 01:31:09.764
VERY HYPER VIGILANT. YOU KNOW,

01:31:09.831 --> 01:31:12.166
THEY'RE ALWAYS ON GUARD. I'M A

01:31:12.233 --> 01:31:13.901
SURVIVOR OF A CHILD WHO WAS IN A

01:31:13.968 --> 01:31:14.602
HOUSEHOLD WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:31:14.669 --> 01:31:16.070
ALSO, AND I REMEMBER JUST ALWAYS

01:31:16.137 --> 01:31:18.339
BEING ON GUARD. I'M A MILITARY

01:31:18.406 --> 01:31:19.907
FAMILY. MY FATHER WAS A PRISONER

01:31:19.974 --> 01:31:21.943
OF WAR, A BATAAN DEATH MARCH

01:31:22.009 --> 01:31:23.411
SURVIVOR, AND STAYED IN FOR 20

01:31:23.477 --> 01:31:24.846
YEARS. SO HE HAD HIS OWN DUFFEL

01:31:24.912 --> 01:31:26.614
BAG FULL OF ISSUES. AND THAT

01:31:26.681 --> 01:31:28.449
COMES DOWN TO YOUR CHILDREN. YOU

01:31:28.516 --> 01:31:30.251
KNOW, MANY BEGIN TO NORMALIZE,

01:31:30.318 --> 01:31:31.953
ABUSE AND REPEAT THAT CYCLE

01:31:32.019 --> 01:31:33.888
LATER IN LIFE. THE ONE THING I

01:31:33.955 --> 01:31:35.723
DO WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT IS,

01:31:35.790 --> 01:31:38.226
THOUGH WE'VE SEEN A INCREASE IN

01:31:38.292 --> 01:31:39.527
ADULT STRANGULATION AND

01:31:39.594 --> 01:31:41.729
PEDIATRIC STRANGULATION. BUT

01:31:41.796 --> 01:31:43.164
WHEN WE FIRST OPENED OUR DOORS

01:31:43.231 --> 01:31:45.600
IN 2016, WE HAD NINE REPORTED

01:31:45.666 --> 01:31:48.102
CASES OF WOMEN WHO DISCLOSED

01:31:48.169 --> 01:31:49.971
THEY'VE BEEN THEY USED THE TERM

01:31:50.037 --> 01:31:52.106
CHOKE. WE WEREN'T WE WEREN'T

01:31:52.173 --> 01:31:53.774
TRAINED IN IT. WE WEREN'T

01:31:53.841 --> 01:31:54.942
TRAINED FOR ASSESSING IT OR

01:31:55.009 --> 01:31:56.010
ANYTHING LIKE THAT. OUR WHOLE

01:31:56.077 --> 01:31:58.246
STAFF NOW HAS RECEIVED ADVANCED

01:31:58.312 --> 01:32:01.849
TRAINING AND OUR DATA, IT'S LIKE

01:32:01.916 --> 01:32:03.117
89 TO 90% OF THE CLIENTS WHO

01:32:03.184 --> 01:32:04.518
COME THROUGH THERE HAVE

01:32:04.585 --> 01:32:06.120
EXPERIENCED SOME FORM OF

01:32:06.187 --> 01:32:08.623
STRANGULATION CHILDREN. WHEN IT

01:32:08.689 --> 01:32:10.524
COMES TO PEDIATRIC, WE'VE SEEN

01:32:10.591 --> 01:32:12.326
AN INCREASE OF CHILDREN WHO'VE

01:32:12.393 --> 01:32:14.862
BEEN STRANGLED, EITHER BY A

01:32:14.929 --> 01:32:16.564
CHILD AT SCHOOL OR MOM'S

01:32:16.631 --> 01:32:18.065
BOYFRIEND OR FATHER OR SOMEONE

01:32:18.132 --> 01:32:20.101
IN THE HOUSEHOLD. THE THING

01:32:20.167 --> 01:32:22.403
ABOUT IT, WHEN IT COMES TO

01:32:22.470 --> 01:32:23.304
STRANGULATION, THERE'S GENERALLY

01:32:23.371 --> 01:32:24.972
OVER 50% OF THE CASES. THERE'S

01:32:25.039 --> 01:32:27.341
NO VISIBLE INJURIES, SO YOU

01:32:27.408 --> 01:32:29.176
REALLY NEED TO TAKE

01:32:29.243 --> 01:32:30.845
STRANGULATION AS AN EMERGENCY

01:32:30.912 --> 01:32:32.413
MEDICAL. THEY NEED TO GO GET A

01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:35.516
CT SCAN SO THEY CAN HAVE THE

01:32:35.583 --> 01:32:36.417
INTERNALS, SEE IF THERE'S ANY

01:32:36.484 --> 01:32:39.253
KIND OF DAMAGE, BECAUSE YOU CAN

01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:40.621
HAVE BRAIN DAMAGE, STROKE AND

01:32:40.688 --> 01:32:42.456
EVEN MEMORY LOSS OR DEATH WITHIN

01:32:42.523 --> 01:32:44.725
JUST A FEW SECONDS. THE ONE

01:32:44.792 --> 01:32:46.761
THING THAT I KNOW THE ASSEMBLY

01:32:46.827 --> 01:32:47.895
WOMAN TALKED ABOUT BEFORE SHE

01:32:47.962 --> 01:32:50.298
LEFT WAS STRANGULATION DURING

01:32:50.364 --> 01:32:51.899
SEX. THIS IS A CONVERSATION THAT

01:32:51.966 --> 01:32:54.235
MOST OF US DON'T HAVE WITH OUR

01:32:54.302 --> 01:32:56.537
CHILDREN. SO GET YOUR AUNTS AND

01:32:56.604 --> 01:32:58.005
UNCLES TO DO IT FOR YOUR KIDS,

01:32:58.072 --> 01:32:59.740
YOU KNOW, BUT TEENS ARE BEING

01:32:59.807 --> 01:33:01.008
STRANGLED DURING SEX OR WHAT'S

01:33:01.075 --> 01:33:03.311
CALLED ROUGH SEX AND TEENS.

01:33:03.377 --> 01:33:05.446
STRANGULATION IS BEING USED IN

01:33:05.513 --> 01:33:06.180
DATING RELATIONSHIPS, EVEN

01:33:06.247 --> 01:33:08.049
DURING CONSENSUAL OR

01:33:08.115 --> 01:33:09.784
NON-CONSENSUAL ACTS. MANY DON'T

01:33:09.850 --> 01:33:12.720
REALIZE IT'S ABUSE. IT'S A FRAME

01:33:12.787 --> 01:33:15.489
OF PASSION. SO WE NEED TO TEACH

01:33:15.556 --> 01:33:17.091
OTHERS THAT STRANGULATION IS

01:33:17.158 --> 01:33:18.726
NEVER SAFE. IT'S AN ACT OF

01:33:18.793 --> 01:33:20.661
CONTROL AND DOMINANCE, NOT LOVE.

01:33:20.728 --> 01:33:22.863
AND THERE IS NO SAFE WAY TO

01:33:22.930 --> 01:33:24.598
STRANGLE SOMEONE. YOU CANNOT

01:33:24.665 --> 01:33:26.267
CONSENT TO SOMETHING THAT CAN

01:33:26.334 --> 01:33:28.602
CAUSE BODILY HARM OR CAN KILL

01:33:28.669 --> 01:33:31.072
YOU. SO YOU, SENATOR RUBIO, YOU

01:33:31.138 --> 01:33:32.940
SAID YOU HAVE A SON, YOU KNOW,

01:33:33.007 --> 01:33:34.308
HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. BECAUSE

01:33:34.375 --> 01:33:36.377
IF YOU THINK ABOUT A COUPLE

01:33:36.444 --> 01:33:38.579
HAVING STRANGULATION

01:33:38.646 --> 01:33:40.748
INCORPORATED INTO THEIR SEX,

01:33:40.815 --> 01:33:42.550
THERE'S ONE PERSON THAT'S A

01:33:42.616 --> 01:33:43.951
VICTIM, AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER

01:33:44.018 --> 01:33:45.119
PERSON THAT CAN HAVE A

01:33:45.186 --> 01:33:46.988
CONSEQUENCE OF PRISON TIME FOR

01:33:47.054 --> 01:33:48.723
DEATH OR FOR SERIOUSLY BODILY

01:33:48.789 --> 01:33:50.591
HURTING SOMEONE. SO WE HAVE TO

01:33:50.658 --> 01:33:52.059
HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS. HOW

01:33:52.126 --> 01:33:53.995
YOU HAVE THEM IS A DIFFERENT

01:33:54.061 --> 01:33:55.863
STORY. I KNOW THE NATIONAL

01:33:55.930 --> 01:33:57.365
INSTITUTE INSTITUTE ON

01:33:57.431 --> 01:33:58.632
STRANGULATION PREVENTION, WHICH

01:33:58.699 --> 01:34:01.202
IS PART OF THE FAMILY JUSTICE

01:34:01.268 --> 01:34:02.703
CENTER ALLIANCE. I'M ON A COUPLE

01:34:02.770 --> 01:34:03.838
OF THEIR COMMITTEES, NATIONAL

01:34:03.904 --> 01:34:04.905
COMMITTEES. WE'RE COMING UP WITH

01:34:04.972 --> 01:34:06.674
TALKING POINTS THAT FAMILIES CAN

01:34:06.741 --> 01:34:09.176
TALK TO THEIR KIDS ABOUT. IF YOU

01:34:09.243 --> 01:34:10.344
THINK ABOUT WHERE ARE THEY

01:34:10.411 --> 01:34:11.579
GETTING THIS INFORMATION ABOUT

01:34:11.645 --> 01:34:14.315
SEX, IT'S GLAMORIZED ALL OVER

01:34:14.382 --> 01:34:16.384
SOCIAL MEDIA. WE ALSO USE

01:34:16.450 --> 01:34:18.285
EVIDENCE BASED RISK ASSESSMENT

01:34:18.352 --> 01:34:20.287
TOOLS. WE USE WHAT'S CALLED THE

01:34:20.354 --> 01:34:22.590
DANGER ASSESSMENT 20. IT WAS

01:34:22.656 --> 01:34:24.392
DEVELOPED BY DOCTOR JACKIE

01:34:24.458 --> 01:34:26.460
CAMPBELL. IT'S A VALIDATED,

01:34:26.527 --> 01:34:28.596
VALIDATED TOOL THAT IDENTIFIES

01:34:28.662 --> 01:34:30.898
RISK FACTORS FOR LETHALITY,

01:34:30.965 --> 01:34:32.733
INCLUDING STRANGULATION,

01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:34.502
COERCIVE CONTROL, WEAPON USE,

01:34:34.568 --> 01:34:36.704
AND THREATS. IT ALLOWS US TO

01:34:36.771 --> 01:34:39.040
RESPOND WITH URGENCY, NOT LIKE

01:34:39.106 --> 01:34:41.876
GUESSWORK. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT

01:34:41.942 --> 01:34:44.145
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS

01:34:44.211 --> 01:34:45.546
PREDICTABLE, AND IF IT'S

01:34:45.613 --> 01:34:47.381
PREDICTABLE, THEREFORE IT'S

01:34:47.448 --> 01:34:48.783
PREVENTABLE. AND THE LETHALITY

01:34:48.849 --> 01:34:50.418
ASSESSMENT CAN REALLY HELP. IT'S

01:34:50.484 --> 01:34:52.520
A SCORE BASED TOOL. OF COURSE,

01:34:52.586 --> 01:34:54.522
THE MORE SCORE, HIGHER THE

01:34:54.588 --> 01:34:56.023
SCORE, THE MORE LETHAL YOUR

01:34:56.090 --> 01:34:58.893
RELATIONSHIP IS. WE ALSO DO ON

01:34:58.959 --> 01:35:00.361
EVERYONE WHO'S HAD A DANGER

01:35:00.428 --> 01:35:01.429
ASSESSMENT, BUT ON OTHERS TOO.

01:35:01.495 --> 01:35:03.197
WE ALSO DO PERSONALIZED SAFETY

01:35:03.264 --> 01:35:05.433
PLANS ON OUR CHILDREN, ON OUR

01:35:05.499 --> 01:35:07.001
TEENS, ON OUR ADULTS. THEY

01:35:07.068 --> 01:35:08.469
INCLUDE LIKE ESCAPE ROUTES, YOU

01:35:08.536 --> 01:35:10.571
KNOW, MONEY, FINANCIAL, YOU

01:35:10.638 --> 01:35:12.173
KNOW, SAFETY PLAN ISN'T A ONE

01:35:12.239 --> 01:35:13.674
TIME BEALL THING. IT'S SOMETHING

01:35:13.741 --> 01:35:15.776
THAT CHANGES ALL THE TIME

01:35:15.843 --> 01:35:17.678
DEPENDING ON YOUR SITUATION. I

01:35:17.745 --> 01:35:20.081
THINK WE'RE KIND OF THE EXPERTS

01:35:20.147 --> 01:35:22.116
IN OUR AREA ON SAFETY PLANNING,

01:35:22.183 --> 01:35:24.018
BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS VERY

01:35:24.085 --> 01:35:26.253
MUCH NEEDED. YOU CANNOT SAY, GO

01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:26.987
GET A RESTRAINING ORDER WITHOUT

01:35:27.054 --> 01:35:29.223
DOING A SAFETY PLAN. CHILD

01:35:29.290 --> 01:35:30.858
PROTECTIVE SERVICES, IF THEY

01:35:30.925 --> 01:35:32.293
WANT THAT FAMILY TO GET A

01:35:32.359 --> 01:35:33.494
RESTRAINING ORDER, THEY HAVE TO

01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:35.663
HAVE A SAFETY PLAN. IF LAW

01:35:35.729 --> 01:35:36.831
ENFORCEMENT SAYS WE CAN'T DO

01:35:36.897 --> 01:35:37.364
NOTHING UNLESS YOU GET A

01:35:37.431 --> 01:35:39.800
RESTRAINING ORDER, YOU HAVE TO

01:35:39.867 --> 01:35:41.035
HAVE A SAFETY PLAN. BECAUSE WHAT

01:35:41.102 --> 01:35:42.803
YOU MENTIONED EARLIER, SAFETY

01:35:42.870 --> 01:35:43.971
RESTRAINING ORDERS DON'T SAVE

01:35:44.038 --> 01:35:46.440
LIVES. THEY'RE A PIECE OF PAPER.

01:35:46.507 --> 01:35:48.242
IT'S NOT A SHIELD OF ARMOR. IT

01:35:48.309 --> 01:35:49.910
DOES START A LEGAL DOCUMENT

01:35:49.977 --> 01:35:50.978
TRAIL AND YOU'RE ASKING THE

01:35:51.045 --> 01:35:53.547
COURTS FOR PROTECTION. BUT THE

01:35:53.614 --> 01:35:54.615
MORE LETHAL THE RELATIONSHIP IS,

01:35:54.682 --> 01:35:57.551
THE MORE SCARY IT IS TO GET A

01:35:57.618 --> 01:35:58.185
RESTRAINING ORDER. SO YOU HAVE

01:35:58.252 --> 01:35:59.720
TO HAVE A SAFETY PLAN. MOST

01:35:59.787 --> 01:36:01.122
PEOPLE IN THESE DOMESTIC

01:36:01.188 --> 01:36:02.323
VIOLENCE RELATIONSHIPS DON'T

01:36:02.389 --> 01:36:04.091
WANT TO LEAVE. THEY WANT THAT

01:36:04.158 --> 01:36:07.728
ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR TO STOP. MOST

01:36:07.795 --> 01:36:09.530
OF US, A LOT OF US THINK, OH, IF

01:36:09.597 --> 01:36:11.665
THEY LEAVE THEIR SAFE, WILL THE

01:36:11.732 --> 01:36:12.700
HELL JUST BEGINS ONCE THEY

01:36:12.766 --> 01:36:13.801
LEAVE, YOU KNOW? AND THAT'S WHAT

01:36:13.868 --> 01:36:15.636
I LOVE ABOUT THE FAMILY JUSTICE

01:36:15.703 --> 01:36:17.671
CENTER MODEL. BECAUSE WHEN YOU

01:36:17.738 --> 01:36:20.007
LEAVE, WHEN I LEFT YEARS AGO,

01:36:20.074 --> 01:36:21.475
YOU HAD TO GO FROM AGENCY TO

01:36:21.542 --> 01:36:23.110
AGENCY, RETELLING YOUR STORY RE

01:36:23.177 --> 01:36:24.912
GETTING RETRAUMATIZING AND

01:36:24.979 --> 01:36:26.747
GIVING UP BASICALLY, AND

01:36:26.814 --> 01:36:28.549
SOMETIMES TO AGENCIES WHO MEAN

01:36:28.616 --> 01:36:30.484
WELL BUT ARE NOT SO SENSITIVE TO

01:36:30.551 --> 01:36:31.852
YOUR ISSUE. YOU KNOW, THE FAMILY

01:36:31.919 --> 01:36:32.920
JUSTICE CENTER MODEL, YOU COME

01:36:32.987 --> 01:36:34.388
IN, YOU SHARE THEIR STORY ONE

01:36:34.455 --> 01:36:35.589
TIME AND YOU GET CONNECTED TO

01:36:35.656 --> 01:36:37.892
ALL OF THESE SERVICES UNDER ONE

01:36:37.958 --> 01:36:42.496
ROOF. WE EMPHASIZE REALLY THE

01:36:42.563 --> 01:36:44.365
PROPER SCREENING AND

01:36:44.431 --> 01:36:45.332
DOCUMENTATION, ESPECIALLY IF

01:36:45.399 --> 01:36:46.534
THERE'S BEEN STRANGULATION. WE

01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:48.936
DO A LOT OF TRAINING FOR

01:36:49.003 --> 01:36:50.771
HOSPITALS ON THAT. WE ALSO OFFER

01:36:50.838 --> 01:36:53.807
ART THERAPY AND PLAY THERAPY AND

01:36:53.874 --> 01:36:55.176
TRAUMA FOCUSED BEHAVIORAL

01:36:55.242 --> 01:36:57.011
THERAPY FOR KIDS. WE DO THE

01:36:57.077 --> 01:36:59.480
GROUP THERAPY WE DO. WE JUST

01:36:59.547 --> 01:37:02.082
STARTED THIS NEW GROUP CALLED

01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:04.685
EMOTIONAL HYGIENE GROUP TO HELP

01:37:04.752 --> 01:37:06.420
THEM WITH THEIR. WE DIDN'T WANT

01:37:06.487 --> 01:37:07.721
TO USE THE TERM MENTAL HEALTH,

01:37:07.788 --> 01:37:09.790
BUT. SO THE KIDS WERE REALLY

01:37:09.857 --> 01:37:11.158
DRAWN TO THAT GROUP A HEALTHY

01:37:11.225 --> 01:37:12.426
RELATIONSHIPS. WE DID DO

01:37:12.493 --> 01:37:15.296
GRIEVING AND LOSS AND THEN MUSIC

01:37:15.362 --> 01:37:21.101
AND. EMOTIONS. WE HAVE TO

01:37:21.168 --> 01:37:22.169
UNDERSTAND THE TRAUMA THAT

01:37:22.236 --> 01:37:24.004
PEOPLE GO THROUGH. SO WE SCREEN

01:37:24.071 --> 01:37:25.673
FOR THE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD

01:37:25.739 --> 01:37:27.541
EXPERIENCES. WE USE THE ACS TOOL

01:37:27.608 --> 01:37:29.376
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CHILD HAS

01:37:29.443 --> 01:37:30.744
EXPERIENCED. IT'S NOT JUST HOW

01:37:30.811 --> 01:37:33.247
THEY'RE BEHAVING. ACS ARE

01:37:33.314 --> 01:37:35.216
POTENTIALLY TRAUMATIC EVENTS

01:37:35.282 --> 01:37:36.750
THAT HAPPEN IN A CHILD'S LIFE,

01:37:36.817 --> 01:37:39.220
LIKE THE EMOTIONAL, THE PHYSICAL

01:37:39.286 --> 01:37:40.521
AND THE SEXUAL ABUSE, THE

01:37:40.588 --> 01:37:41.989
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN THE HOME,

01:37:42.056 --> 01:37:45.593
ANY PARENTAL SUBSTANCE ABUSE OR

01:37:45.659 --> 01:37:46.594
INCARCERATION, NEGLECT,

01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:47.628
ABANDONMENT, THOSE TYPES OF

01:37:47.695 --> 01:37:50.164
THINGS. AND THE SCIENCE IS

01:37:50.231 --> 01:37:50.831
REALLY CLEAR ON ACS. THE HIGHER

01:37:50.898 --> 01:37:52.199
THE ACE SCORE, THE GREATER THE

01:37:52.266 --> 01:37:53.901
RISK OF LONG TERM PHYSICAL AND

01:37:53.968 --> 01:37:56.770
MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. ACS

01:37:56.837 --> 01:37:58.472
SCORES ARE LINKED TO HEART

01:37:58.539 --> 01:38:00.674
DISEASE, SUBSTANCE ABUSE,

01:38:00.741 --> 01:38:02.443
DEPRESSION, SCHOOL FAILURE,

01:38:02.509 --> 01:38:04.678
INCARCERATING ORATION, AND EARLY

01:38:04.745 --> 01:38:08.282
DEATH. THE ACS DOESN'T TAKE IN

01:38:08.349 --> 01:38:08.949
CONSIDERATION, THOUGH. THOSE

01:38:09.016 --> 01:38:10.351
CHILDREN WHO LIVE IN AN

01:38:10.417 --> 01:38:11.852
ENVIRONMENT, A COMMUNITY WHERE

01:38:11.919 --> 01:38:14.622
THERE'S LOTS OF VIOLENCE TO. BUT

01:38:14.688 --> 01:38:17.658
HERE'S THE HOPE ACES ARE NOT THE

01:38:17.725 --> 01:38:19.727
DESTINY SUPPORT. THE MORE

01:38:19.793 --> 01:38:20.794
SUPPORTIVE ADULTS THAT THAT

01:38:20.861 --> 01:38:22.596
CHILD HAS AROUND THEM, THE MORE

01:38:22.663 --> 01:38:24.131
TRAUMA INFORMED CARE THEY

01:38:24.198 --> 01:38:25.499
RECEIVE, AND THE SAFE

01:38:25.566 --> 01:38:26.233
ENVIRONMENTS THAT THEY'RE

01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:27.401
INVOLVED IN CAN REALLY HELP

01:38:27.468 --> 01:38:29.536
REDUCE THE IMPACT OF ACS AND

01:38:29.603 --> 01:38:31.572
BUILD THAT RESILIENCE. WE USE

01:38:31.639 --> 01:38:33.407
ACS TO GUIDE OUR THERAPEUTIC

01:38:33.474 --> 01:38:35.276
APPROACH. WE USE IT FOR OUR CASE

01:38:35.342 --> 01:38:37.111
MANAGEMENT AND SAFETY PLANNING,

01:38:37.177 --> 01:38:38.779
NOT TO LABEL KIDS, BUT TO HELP

01:38:38.846 --> 01:38:41.115
THEM HEAL WITH INTENTION. AND

01:38:41.181 --> 01:38:42.516
I'LL JUST SHARE BRIEFLY WITH YOU

01:38:42.583 --> 01:38:44.385
ABOUT OUR CAMP HOPE AMERICA,

01:38:44.451 --> 01:38:46.320
WHERE WE ARE RESTORING CHILDHOOD

01:38:46.387 --> 01:38:49.290
CAMP HOPE IS OUR SUMMER PROGRAM

01:38:49.356 --> 01:38:50.791
FOR KIDS EXPOSED TO DOMESTIC

01:38:50.858 --> 01:38:52.893
VIOLENCE. IT'S NOT JUST THE

01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:54.428
SUMMER CAMP, IT'S BASED AROUND

01:38:54.495 --> 01:38:55.629
THE SCIENCE OF HOPE. I DON'T

01:38:55.696 --> 01:38:58.032
KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS, BUT YOU

01:38:58.098 --> 01:38:59.466
CAN ACTUALLY MEASURE HOPE. IT

01:38:59.533 --> 01:39:00.734
BUILDS RESILIENCE AND TEACHES

01:39:00.801 --> 01:39:03.003
KIDS THAT HOPE IS A LIFE SKILL.

01:39:03.070 --> 01:39:04.338
SO WE MEASURE HOPE. WE USE

01:39:04.405 --> 01:39:07.374
WHAT'S CALLED THE HOPE INDEX

01:39:07.441 --> 01:39:09.843
SURVEY. 30 DAYS BEFORE CAMP. THE

01:39:09.910 --> 01:39:11.512
KIDS TAKE IT WHILE THEY'RE IN

01:39:11.578 --> 01:39:13.080
CAMP. THEY TAKE IT IN 30 DAYS

01:39:13.147 --> 01:39:14.982
AFTER. AND WHAT WE FOUND IS

01:39:15.049 --> 01:39:16.550
WHILE THEY'RE BEFORE CAMP, THEIR

01:39:16.617 --> 01:39:18.185
SCORES ARE LOW, BUT IN CAMP,

01:39:18.252 --> 01:39:19.987
THEY GO UP. WHEN THEY'RE OUT OF

01:39:20.054 --> 01:39:22.022
CAMP, THEY GO BACK LOW. SO WE DO

01:39:22.089 --> 01:39:24.091
ONGOING MONTHLY ACTIVITIES, IN

01:39:24.158 --> 01:39:25.626
PARTICULAR LEADERSHIP ACTIVITIES

01:39:25.693 --> 01:39:27.027
WITH THESE KIDS, BECAUSE WE WANT

01:39:27.094 --> 01:39:28.862
THEM TO KNOW THAT THEIR DREAMS

01:39:28.929 --> 01:39:30.397
CAN COME TRUE, AND WE SEE THAT

01:39:30.464 --> 01:39:32.066
THEIR HOPE SCORES STAY HIGH.

01:39:32.132 --> 01:39:33.500
PROGRAMS LIKE CAMP HOPE GIVE

01:39:33.567 --> 01:39:35.302
CHILDREN AND TEENS A CHANCE TO

01:39:35.369 --> 01:39:37.705
REBUILD TRUST, PROCESS TRAUMA,

01:39:37.771 --> 01:39:40.240
AND EXPERIENCE THE JOY IN A SAFE

01:39:40.307 --> 01:39:41.575
ENVIRONMENT. WE JUST DON'T KEEP

01:39:41.642 --> 01:39:43.344
THEM. WE JUST DON'T HELP THEM

01:39:43.410 --> 01:39:45.412
SURVIVE. WE HELP THEM RESTORE

01:39:45.479 --> 01:39:48.382
HOPE. SO WE KNOW THAT EARLY

01:39:48.449 --> 01:39:49.783
INTERVENTION REALLY DOES SAVE

01:39:49.850 --> 01:39:51.518
LIVES. SO WE TRAIN 911

01:39:51.585 --> 01:39:52.653
DISPATCHERS BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE

01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:53.721
THAT CALL COMES IN. THEY GET

01:39:53.787 --> 01:39:55.889
VERY LITTLE TRAINING ON DOMESTIC

01:39:55.956 --> 01:39:57.224
VIOLENCE AND PARTICULAR HIGH

01:39:57.291 --> 01:39:59.760
RISK CASES OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

01:39:59.827 --> 01:40:01.595
WE HAVE THEM ANSWER. THESE

01:40:01.662 --> 01:40:03.464

01:40:51.645 --> 01:40:52.413
THE BEST IN THE COUNTRY. THERE'S

01:40:52.479 --> 01:40:53.747
THREE REALLY GOOD ONES. I'M SURE

01:40:53.814 --> 01:40:55.349
THERE'S MORE, BUT I KNOW OF

01:40:55.416 --> 01:40:57.050

01:41:12.499 --> 01:41:14.768
BEEN KIND OF A HARD PLACE TO GET

01:41:14.835 --> 01:41:16.737

DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FORENSIC

01:41:41.061 --> 01:41:42.095
EXAMS, THOSE SURVIVORS WHO

01:41:42.162 --> 01:41:43.664
REALLY NEED THEM OFTEN DON'T

01:41:43.730 --> 01:41:46.166
WANT TO GO WITH AN ADVOCATE BY

01:41:46.233 --> 01:41:47.501

01:42:02.883 --> 01:42:04.485
THIS. IT'S CERTIFIED THROUGH THE

01:42:04.551 --> 01:42:06.053
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PENAL CODE.

01:42:06.119 --> 01:42:08.355
YOU KNOW, YOU QUALIFIES AS A

THE COMMUNITY. ALL OF OUR STAFF,

01:42:12.793 --> 01:42:14.061
VOLUNTEERS AND INTERNS HAVE

01:42:14.127 --> 01:42:15.929
RECEIVED, AS I MENTIONED

01:42:15.996 --> 01:42:17.331
EARLIER, ADVANCED TRAINING ON

01:42:17.397 --> 01:42:19.166
STRANGULATION PREVENTION,

01:42:19.233 --> 01:42:21.468
PREVENTION. AND WE ALL SHIFT THE

01:42:21.535 --> 01:42:22.603
FOCUS FROM WHAT'S WRONG WITH

01:42:22.669 --> 01:42:24.705
THIS CHILD TO WHAT HAPPENED TO

01:42:24.771 --> 01:42:25.472
THIS CHILD. AND LAST, I'D LIKE

01:42:25.539 --> 01:42:28.075
TO SAY THAT HOPE IS A STRATEGY.

01:42:28.141 --> 01:42:28.976
SO STRANGULATION, FOR EXAMPLE,

01:42:29.042 --> 01:42:32.112
IS A WARNING SIGN. ACES ARE THE

01:42:32.179 --> 01:42:33.947
PREDICTORS AND HOPE IS OUR

01:42:34.014 --> 01:42:35.382
STRATEGY. WE MUST BELIEVE IN

01:42:35.449 --> 01:42:36.917
CHILDREN. WE NEED TO ACT EARLY

01:42:36.984 --> 01:42:39.052
AND SURROUND THEM WITH CARE AND

01:42:39.119 --> 01:42:41.755
WITH WHEN A TEEN FEELS SAFE,

01:42:41.822 --> 01:42:43.590
SUPPORTED AND BELIEVED, THEY

01:42:43.657 --> 01:42:45.125
BEGIN TO HEAL AND DREAM AGAIN.

01:42:45.192 --> 01:42:46.793
AT THE SACRAMENTO REGIONAL

01:42:46.860 --> 01:42:49.363
FAMILY JUSTICE CENTER, WE WALK

01:42:49.429 --> 01:42:51.632
ALONGSIDE SURVIVORS, ADULTS AND

01:42:51.698 --> 01:42:52.633
CHILDREN AS THEY NAVIGATE THE

01:42:52.699 --> 01:42:54.434
HARDEST CHAPTERS OF THEIR LIFE.

01:42:54.501 --> 01:42:56.970
WE LISTEN, WE BELIEVE THEM, AND

01:42:57.037 --> 01:42:58.372
TOGETHER WE WORK THROUGH THE

01:42:58.438 --> 01:42:59.773
TRAUMA SO THEY CAN BEGIN TO PUT

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:02.609
IT BEHIND THEM. BECAUSE TRAUMA

01:43:02.676 --> 01:43:04.177
IS THE PAST AND HOPE IS THE

01:43:04.244 --> 01:43:06.980
FUTURE. EARLY EVERY SAFETY PLAN,

01:43:07.047 --> 01:43:09.249
EVERY THERAPY LESSON, EVERY

01:43:09.316 --> 01:43:10.951
DANGER ASSESSMENT WE CONDUCT IS

01:43:11.018 --> 01:43:13.120
AN ACT OF BELIEF IN A DIFFERENT

01:43:13.186 --> 01:43:14.988
TOMORROW. WE DON'T JUST WANT

01:43:15.055 --> 01:43:16.924
SURVIVORS TO SURVIVE, WE WANT

01:43:16.990 --> 01:43:18.258
THEM TO THRIVE. CHILDREN WHO

01:43:18.325 --> 01:43:20.127
GROW UP IN VIOLENCE DESERVE MORE

01:43:20.193 --> 01:43:22.129
THAN SILENCE AND FEAR. THEY

01:43:22.195 --> 01:43:23.897
DESERVE VOICES THAT SAY YOU ARE

01:43:23.964 --> 01:43:26.099
SAFE NOW. YOU ARE NOT ALONE AND

01:43:26.166 --> 01:43:28.969
YOUR STORY IS NOT OVER. WE CAN'T

01:43:29.036 --> 01:43:31.071
UNDO WHAT'S BEEN DONE, BUT WE

01:43:31.138 --> 01:43:32.706
CAN BUILD WHAT'S NEXT, AND

01:43:32.773 --> 01:43:35.876
WHAT'S NEXT IS HOPE. SO I'M OPEN

01:43:35.943 --> 01:43:37.210
TO ANY QUESTIONS. AND THANK YOU

01:43:37.277 --> 01:43:38.478
VERY MUCH FOR LISTENING TO ME.

01:43:38.545 --> 01:43:40.847
THERE ARE 27 PLUS FAMILY JUSTICE

01:43:40.914 --> 01:43:44.184
CENTERS AROUND CALIFORNIA, 150

01:43:44.251 --> 01:43:46.253
STATEWIDE AND 150

01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:47.321
INTERNATIONALLY. IT'S A NEW

01:43:47.387 --> 01:43:49.723
CONCEPT. I WISH I WOULD HAVE HAD

01:43:49.790 --> 01:43:51.091
IT WHEN I WAS GOING THROUGH

01:43:51.158 --> 01:43:51.992
MINE. I'M A SURVIVOR OF GUN

01:43:52.059 --> 01:43:53.794
VIOLENCE. MY HUSBAND SHOT AT ME

01:43:53.860 --> 01:43:54.928
WITH AN AUTOMATIC WEAPON HE

01:43:54.995 --> 01:43:55.662
MISSED. THANK GOODNESS I

01:43:55.729 --> 01:43:57.397
WOULDN'T BE SITTING HERE TODAY,

01:43:57.464 --> 01:43:59.900
YOU KNOW? BUT OUR TWO CHILDREN

01:43:59.967 --> 01:44:00.734
WERE SEVEN AND EIGHT AT THE

01:44:00.801 --> 01:44:02.836
TIME. THEY WERE EXPOSED TO THAT.

01:44:02.903 --> 01:44:05.038
AND FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, I

01:44:05.105 --> 01:44:06.907
CARRY THAT SORT OF GUILT. EVEN

01:44:06.974 --> 01:44:08.675
THOUGH I KNOW IT WASN'T MY

01:44:08.742 --> 01:44:09.710
FAULT, I STILL CARRY THAT.

01:44:09.776 --> 01:44:11.244
THEY'RE ADULTS NOW. THEY HAVE

01:44:11.311 --> 01:44:13.080
THEIR OWN LIVES. I WENT INTO

01:44:13.146 --> 01:44:14.815
THEIR HIGH SCHOOLS AND THEIR

01:44:14.881 --> 01:44:16.516
HOME EC CLASS AT THAT TIME, AND

01:44:16.583 --> 01:44:17.918
THEIR HEALTH CLASSES TALKING

01:44:17.985 --> 01:44:19.353
ABOUT TEEN DATING VIOLENCE. AND

01:44:19.419 --> 01:44:20.621
THAT'S MANY YEARS BECAUSE MY

01:44:20.687 --> 01:44:22.255
KIDS ARE IN THEIR 50S NOW, YOU

01:44:22.322 --> 01:44:24.057
KNOW? SO I WAS ABLE TO BREAK

01:44:24.124 --> 01:44:25.926
THAT GENERATIONAL CYCLE FOR

01:44:25.993 --> 01:44:27.694
THEM. AND EDUCATION IS THE KEY.

01:44:27.761 --> 01:44:29.396
SO THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THANK

01:44:29.463 --> 01:44:31.331
YOU VERY MUCH. AND WELCOME,

01:44:31.398 --> 01:44:32.499
ASSEMBLYMEMBER RODRIGUEZ. WE'VE

01:44:32.566 --> 01:44:34.901
BEEN PING PONGING IN AND OUT.

01:44:34.968 --> 01:44:36.503
WE'VE HAD AMAZING PANELISTS. WE

01:44:36.570 --> 01:44:39.573
HAVE TWO MORE. WOULD YOU LIKE TO

01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:42.175
SAY ANYTHING LISTENING. THANK

01:44:42.242 --> 01:44:45.245
YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. SO NEXT

01:44:45.312 --> 01:44:49.216
WE HAVE SUSIE FLORES. SUSIE IS

01:44:49.282 --> 01:44:51.652
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. SHE USED

01:44:51.718 --> 01:44:53.954
TO BE AT THE CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY

01:44:54.021 --> 01:44:55.188
DIRECTOR OF INNER CIRCLE

01:44:55.255 --> 01:44:56.223
CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY CENTER. AND

01:44:56.289 --> 01:44:58.659
I MET SUSIE YEARS AGO WITH THE

01:44:58.725 --> 01:45:00.160
COVINA, THE CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY

01:45:00.227 --> 01:45:01.795
CENTER. I THINK ALL THE ADVOCACY

01:45:01.862 --> 01:45:02.929
CENTERS ARE THE SAME. THEY JUST

01:45:02.996 --> 01:45:04.364
CHANGED THEIR NAME.

01:45:04.431 --> 01:45:06.133
UNFORTUNATELY, YOU EXIST, AND I

01:45:06.199 --> 01:45:10.504
ALWAYS TALK ABOUT. HOW

01:45:10.570 --> 01:45:12.639
HEARTBREAKING IT IS FOR CHILDREN

01:45:12.706 --> 01:45:15.942
TO GO THROUGH THIS TRAUMA. AND I

01:45:16.009 --> 01:45:16.877
JUST IT'S NOT A QUESTION. I'M

01:45:16.943 --> 01:45:18.812
JUST GOING TO THROW IT OUT

01:45:18.879 --> 01:45:20.547
THERE. I THINK I'VE MENTIONED A

01:45:20.614 --> 01:45:21.848
FEW TIMES THAT WE DO A LOT FOR

01:45:21.915 --> 01:45:23.617
THE VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC

01:45:23.684 --> 01:45:25.052
VIOLENCE, WHICH IS REALLY,

01:45:25.118 --> 01:45:26.787
REALLY IMPORTANT. BUT AT SOME

01:45:26.853 --> 01:45:30.657
POINT, THE ROOT OF THAT IS THE

01:45:30.724 --> 01:45:32.092
ABUSERS. AND I'VE SAID IT BEFORE

01:45:32.159 --> 01:45:33.593
AND IT PAINS ME BECAUSE

01:45:33.660 --> 01:45:34.761
OBVIOUSLY IF THEY'RE CREATING

01:45:34.828 --> 01:45:37.397
THIS KIND OF PAIN FOR FAMILIES

01:45:37.464 --> 01:45:38.899
AND CHILDREN AND WOMEN AND

01:45:38.965 --> 01:45:41.401
SOMETIMES OTHER MEN, RIGHT? YOU

01:45:41.468 --> 01:45:43.270
KNOW, WE WANT TO DO EVERYTHING

01:45:43.336 --> 01:45:44.337
FOR THE VICTIMS. BUT UNTIL WE

01:45:44.404 --> 01:45:45.605
ADDRESS THE ROOT ISSUE, WHICH IS

01:45:45.672 --> 01:45:47.941
THE TRAUMA THAT THE ABUSER HAS

01:45:48.008 --> 01:45:48.842
SUFFERED, BECAUSE CLEARLY

01:45:48.909 --> 01:45:50.577
THERE'S ABUSE, THERE'S SOME

01:45:50.644 --> 01:45:51.478
TRAUMA THERE BECAUSE OTHERWISE

01:45:51.545 --> 01:45:53.113
THEY WOULDN'T BE DOING WHAT

01:45:53.180 --> 01:45:55.182
THEY'RE DOING. SO THANK YOU FOR

01:45:55.248 --> 01:45:57.784
HIGHLIGHTING THAT. AND MAYBE AT

01:45:57.851 --> 01:45:59.453
SOME POINT WE CAN GET SOME IDEAS

01:45:59.519 --> 01:46:01.121
OF HOW WE CAN BREAK THOSE CYCLES

01:46:01.188 --> 01:46:02.489
AS WELL, SINCE YOU BROUGHT THAT

01:46:02.556 --> 01:46:04.624
UP. SO THANK YOU SUSIE. WELCOME.

WELL. SO I'LL BE SERVING IN THAT

01:46:28.115 --> 01:46:30.083
CAPACITY IN THE NEXT FOR THE

01:46:30.150 --> 01:46:31.785
NEXT TWO YEARS. BUT I'M HERE TO

01:46:31.852 --> 01:46:33.320
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

01:46:33.386 --> 01:46:33.954
CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY CENTERS AND

01:46:34.020 --> 01:46:35.455
HOW IT RELATES TO CHILDREN WHO

01:46:35.522 --> 01:46:37.257
ARE EXPOSED TO DOMESTIC

01:46:37.324 --> 01:46:40.026
VIOLENCE. IN BRIEF, WHAT

01:46:40.093 --> 01:46:41.561
CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY CENTERS ARE

01:46:41.628 --> 01:46:44.064
ARE THEY ARE CENTERS WHERE WE

01:46:44.131 --> 01:46:45.132
WORK WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF

01:46:45.198 --> 01:46:46.967
WHAT'S CALLED A

01:46:47.033 --> 01:46:48.001
MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM. AND THAT

01:46:48.068 --> 01:46:50.237
CAN CHANGE THROUGH COUNTIES. I'M

01:46:50.303 --> 01:46:51.671
NOT SURE IF THAT'S REFERRED TO

01:46:51.738 --> 01:46:53.140
IN. SACRAMENTO CENTER SAFE

01:46:53.206 --> 01:46:57.744
CENTER. OKAY. BUT WE WORK WITH

01:46:57.811 --> 01:46:59.913
IN COLLABORATION WITH LAW

01:46:59.980 --> 01:47:01.782
ENFORCEMENT, CHILD PROTECTIVE

01:47:01.848 --> 01:47:03.884
SERVICES, AS WELL AS OUR DA'S

01:47:03.950 --> 01:47:06.853
OFFICE AND ALSO COMMUNITY CARE

01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:09.389
LICENSING. WE RECEIVE REFERRALS

01:47:09.456 --> 01:47:10.724
FROM THESE SPECIFIC

01:47:10.791 --> 01:47:12.125
INVESTIGATIVE AGENCIES WHENEVER

01:47:12.192 --> 01:47:15.095
THERE'S ANY ALLEGATION OF CHILD

01:47:15.162 --> 01:47:16.163
MALTREATMENT THAT IS BEING

01:47:16.229 --> 01:47:17.697
CURRENTLY INVESTIGATED. SO THEN,

01:47:17.764 --> 01:47:19.399
AS FORENSIC INTERVIEWERS, I

01:47:19.466 --> 01:47:21.234
STILL SERVE A DUAL ROLE. I AM

01:47:21.301 --> 01:47:22.636
DIRECTOR, BUT I LOVE STAYING

01:47:22.702 --> 01:47:24.738
STILL IN THE TRENCHES AND I

01:47:24.805 --> 01:47:28.008
STILL CONDUCT INTERVIEWS. AND SO

01:47:28.074 --> 01:47:29.543
WHEN CHILDREN ARE REFERRED TO

01:47:29.609 --> 01:47:32.245
OUR CENTER AS ESPECIALLY IN

01:47:32.312 --> 01:47:34.514
CASES LIKE THIS, OFTENTIMES WE

01:47:34.581 --> 01:47:36.750
DON'T KNOW UPFRONT THAT THEY

01:47:36.817 --> 01:47:39.186
ACTUALLY HAVE WITNESSED, WE KNOW

01:47:39.252 --> 01:47:41.788
THAT THEY HAVE BRUISES AND BUMPS

01:47:41.855 --> 01:47:43.089
THEMSELVES, BUT WE DON'T KNOW

01:47:43.156 --> 01:47:44.958
NECESSARILY WHY THAT CAME ABOUT.

01:47:45.025 --> 01:47:46.393
WE JUST ASSUME SOMETHING

01:47:46.459 --> 01:47:48.094
HAPPENED. IT IS OUR JOB AS

01:47:48.161 --> 01:47:49.930
FORENSIC INTERVIEWERS TO ASK

01:47:49.996 --> 01:47:52.199
OPEN ENDED QUESTIONS OF THESE

01:47:52.265 --> 01:47:53.200
CHILDREN, TO ELICIT FREE

01:47:53.266 --> 01:47:54.267
NARRATIVES FROM THEM ABOUT

01:47:54.334 --> 01:47:56.102
WHATEVER MAY HAVE HAPPENED. SO

01:47:56.169 --> 01:47:59.306
WE CAN AGAIN, WE DO THIS IN A

01:47:59.372 --> 01:48:01.474
VERY SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR THESE

01:48:01.541 --> 01:48:04.144
CHILDREN, VERY CHILD FRIENDLY AS

01:48:04.211 --> 01:48:05.745
WELL. OUR AGAIN, OUR QUESTIONS

01:48:05.812 --> 01:48:07.380
ARE OPEN ENDED TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:48:07.447 --> 01:48:08.648
THEY ARE PROVIDING US WITH THE

01:48:08.715 --> 01:48:10.317
MOST ACCURATE FREE NARRATIVE

01:48:10.383 --> 01:48:11.785
THAT THEY CAN, BECAUSE NO ONE

01:48:11.852 --> 01:48:13.320
ELSE WAS THERE EXCEPT FOR THEM.

01:48:13.386 --> 01:48:14.855
AND THEIR THEIR VOICES ARE

01:48:14.921 --> 01:48:18.491
EQUALLY IMPORTANT. ONCE WE

01:48:18.558 --> 01:48:20.260
CONDUCT THESE AT OUR CENTERS.

01:48:20.327 --> 01:48:21.661
AND MIND YOU, EACH CENTER

01:48:21.728 --> 01:48:23.129
OPERATES A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY

01:48:23.196 --> 01:48:25.265
THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE DO HAVE

01:48:25.332 --> 01:48:28.401
52 SIX IN IN OUR STATE,

01:48:28.468 --> 01:48:31.404
REPRESENTING 44 COUNTIES, BUT AT

01:48:31.471 --> 01:48:33.773
EACH CENTER FOR THE MOST PART.

01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:36.009
AND PLEASE CHIME IN IF YOU

01:48:36.076 --> 01:48:39.646
WANTED TO TALK ABOUT YOURS. BUT.

01:48:39.713 --> 01:48:40.647
AT OUR MOST CENTERS, THEY'RE

01:48:40.714 --> 01:48:42.382
GREETED BY VICTIM ADVOCATES.

01:48:42.449 --> 01:48:43.984
THEY'RE ORIENTED TO THE

01:48:44.050 --> 01:48:45.352
HAPPENINGS OF THE DAY. THEY'RE

01:48:45.418 --> 01:48:46.953
THEY'RE TOLD WHY THEY'RE GOING

01:48:47.020 --> 01:48:47.821
TO WHAT THEY'RE NOT, WHAT

01:48:47.888 --> 01:48:49.422
THEY'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT, BUT

01:48:49.489 --> 01:48:51.858
WHY THEY'RE THERE. WHAT'S GOING

01:48:51.925 --> 01:48:52.425
TO HAPPEN. THE PROCESS. OUR

01:48:52.492 --> 01:48:53.593
VICTIM ADVOCATES ALSO CONDUCT A

01:48:53.660 --> 01:48:54.995
LITTLE BRIEF NEEDS ASSESSMENTS

01:48:55.061 --> 01:48:57.297
OF THE FAMILIES TO SEE WHAT WHAT

01:48:57.364 --> 01:48:58.798
WHAT ARE THEIR NEEDS, HOW CAN WE

01:48:58.865 --> 01:49:00.567
HELP THEM EITHER SERVICES THAT

01:49:00.634 --> 01:49:02.235
WE ARE AT OUR OWN CENTERS

01:49:02.302 --> 01:49:04.104
PROVIDE, OR WE CAN CONNECT THEM

01:49:04.170 --> 01:49:05.872
TO COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS.

01:49:05.939 --> 01:49:07.140
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE LIKE THAT

01:49:07.207 --> 01:49:09.910
ARE PRESENT HERE TODAY. ONCE

01:49:09.976 --> 01:49:11.478
THAT ALL HAPPENS, INTERVIEWERS

01:49:11.544 --> 01:49:13.580
LIKE MYSELF WILL THEN INTRODUCE

01:49:13.647 --> 01:49:15.282
OURSELVES TO THE CHILD AND

01:49:15.348 --> 01:49:16.683
EXPLAIN TO THEM VERY, VERY

01:49:16.750 --> 01:49:18.585
BRIEFLY WHAT OUR ROLE IS AND HOW

01:49:18.652 --> 01:49:19.819
WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING

01:49:19.886 --> 01:49:21.454
TOGETHER THAT DAY. THEN ONCE WE

01:49:21.521 --> 01:49:22.923
TAKE THEM INTO OUR INTERVIEW

01:49:22.989 --> 01:49:23.857
ROOM, THEN THAT'S WHERE THE

01:49:23.924 --> 01:49:26.059
DIFFICULT WORK COMES INTO PLAY,

01:49:26.126 --> 01:49:27.661
BECAUSE IT IS JUST A CHILD AND

01:49:27.727 --> 01:49:29.763
SOMEONE LIKE MYSELF. AND I'M

01:49:29.829 --> 01:49:32.265
GOING TO GIVE YOU A VERY BRIEF

01:49:32.332 --> 01:49:33.733
AND PLEASE NOTE, I CHANGED A LOT

01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:35.769
OF THE IDENTIFYING INFORMATION

01:49:35.835 --> 01:49:37.637
OF TWO CASES THAT THAT REALLY

01:49:37.704 --> 01:49:39.806
STAND OUT TO ME, BECAUSE THIS IS

01:49:39.873 --> 01:49:42.142
WHAT CHILDREN DO ENDURE WHEN

01:49:42.208 --> 01:49:44.010
THERE ARE CASES OF DOMESTIC

01:49:44.077 --> 01:49:45.845
VIOLENCE. NOT ONLY ARE THEY

01:49:45.912 --> 01:49:48.381
SUBJECTED TO VIEWING THE ADULT

01:49:48.448 --> 01:49:50.917
IN THEIR LIFE BEING HURT,

01:49:50.984 --> 01:49:52.385
WHETHER IT BE VERBALLY,

01:49:52.452 --> 01:49:54.955
PHYSICALLY OR BOTH, BUT THEY

01:49:55.021 --> 01:49:56.356
THEMSELVES ARE SUBJECTED TO A

01:49:56.423 --> 01:49:59.359
LOT AS WELL. SO I HAVE TWO TWO

01:49:59.426 --> 01:50:01.394
CASES, VERY BRIEF. ONE WAS OF

01:50:01.461 --> 01:50:02.796
TWO SISTERS, NINE AND 11 YEARS

01:50:02.862 --> 01:50:04.698
OLD. I'LL JUST REFER TO THEM AS

01:50:04.764 --> 01:50:07.167
LARA AND SAMANTHA. THEIR MOTHER

01:50:07.233 --> 01:50:09.169
WAS SEVERELY BEING BEATEN BY

01:50:09.235 --> 01:50:10.770
THEIR FATHER, WHO HAD ALREADY

01:50:10.837 --> 01:50:14.374
PREVIOUSLY BEEN INCARCERATED FOR

01:50:14.441 --> 01:50:17.610
ANOTHER CHILD ABUSE CASE

01:50:17.677 --> 01:50:20.080
UNRELATED TO THEIRS. WHEN HE WAS

01:50:20.146 --> 01:50:23.383
RELEASED. DUE TO THE

01:50:23.450 --> 01:50:24.784
COMPLEXITIES OF DOMESTIC

01:50:24.851 --> 01:50:26.987
VIOLENCE, THE MOTHER ALLOWED HIM

01:50:27.053 --> 01:50:29.155
BACK INTO THE HOME. AS A RESULT

01:50:29.222 --> 01:50:31.925
OF THAT, HE CAME OUT AND STARTED

01:50:31.992 --> 01:50:33.026
SEXUALLY ABUSING BOTH HIS

01:50:33.093 --> 01:50:34.427
DAUGHTER. IN THE BEGINNING, IT

01:50:34.494 --> 01:50:36.796
WAS, UNBEKNOWNST TO BOTH OF THEM

01:50:36.863 --> 01:50:38.098
WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO EACH

01:50:38.164 --> 01:50:40.734
SISTER. BUT THEN IT TURNED EVEN

01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:41.901
WORSE FOR THESE YOUNG GIRLS. AND

01:50:41.968 --> 01:50:43.503
MIND YOU, THIS IS AGAIN

01:50:43.570 --> 01:50:45.038
INFORMATION WE'RE GATHERING FOR

01:50:45.105 --> 01:50:47.407
THEM FOR PURPOSES OF THE

01:50:47.474 --> 01:50:50.510
INVESTIGATION FROM THEIR BOTH

01:50:50.577 --> 01:50:54.347
GIRLS LEARNED THAT THEY WERE

01:50:54.414 --> 01:50:56.149
BEING ABUSED ONCE, THAT THEY

01:50:56.216 --> 01:50:58.218
LEARNED THAT THEN HE THEN HAD

01:50:58.284 --> 01:51:00.186
BOTH SISTERS START ABUSING ONE

01:51:00.253 --> 01:51:03.723
ANOTHER IN FRONT OF HIM. SO IT

01:51:03.790 --> 01:51:05.091
WAS VERY DETAILED INFORMATION

01:51:05.158 --> 01:51:06.493
THAT THEY PROVIDED. THIS

01:51:06.559 --> 01:51:08.294
INCLUDED RAPE OF BOTH OF THE

01:51:08.361 --> 01:51:10.964
GIRLS AND THEN PERFORMING SEXUAL

01:51:11.031 --> 01:51:13.366
ACTS UPON ONE ANOTHER WHILE HE

01:51:13.433 --> 01:51:16.703
OBSERVED. THIS WAS THE FATHER.

01:51:16.770 --> 01:51:18.805
I'M SORRY. THIS WAS THE FATHER?

01:51:18.872 --> 01:51:21.007
YES. BIOLOGICAL FATHER? YES. AND

01:51:21.074 --> 01:51:22.742
THEN WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING WAS

01:51:22.809 --> 01:51:24.878
THESE LITTLE POOR GIRLS WERE IN

01:51:24.944 --> 01:51:26.046
A SITUATION WHERE IT'S

01:51:26.112 --> 01:51:27.380
LITERALLY. I'M DAMNED IF I DO,

01:51:27.447 --> 01:51:29.883
DAMNED IF I DON'T. BECAUSE IF HE

01:51:29.949 --> 01:51:31.684
IF THE GIRLS, QUOTE UNQUOTE

01:51:31.751 --> 01:51:34.220
ALLOWED HIM TO PERFORM SEX ACTS,

01:51:34.287 --> 01:51:36.523
HE WOULD ABUSE THEM AND SAID AND

01:51:36.589 --> 01:51:39.292
SAY, YOU'RE EASY. IF THE GIRLS

01:51:39.359 --> 01:51:40.927
DENIED AND FOUGHT BACK, HE WOULD

01:51:40.994 --> 01:51:43.329
BEAT THEM AND THEN SAY, BUT I'M

01:51:43.396 --> 01:51:44.998
YOUR FATHER. I'M SUPPOSED TO DO

01:51:45.065 --> 01:51:47.600
THESE THINGS. SO SITTING IN A

01:51:47.667 --> 01:51:48.768
ROOM WITH THESE GIRLS AND BEING

01:51:48.835 --> 01:51:50.904
ABLE TO PROVIDE THEM THAT SPACE,

01:51:50.970 --> 01:51:54.808
BOTH FREE OF JUDGMENT, BUT JUST

01:51:54.874 --> 01:51:56.676
PURE COMPASSION AND LISTENING

01:51:56.743 --> 01:51:58.478
EARS SO WE CAN GET AS MUCH

01:51:58.545 --> 01:52:00.246
INFORMATION AS WE COULD TO

01:52:00.313 --> 01:52:02.682
HOPEFULLY PROSECUTE THIS PERSON.

01:52:02.749 --> 01:52:04.651
THAT WAS OUR THAT WAS OUR GOAL.

01:52:04.717 --> 01:52:05.885
AND THANKFULLY, IT WAS MET. AND

01:52:05.952 --> 01:52:08.955
THE GIRL'S DIFFICULT AS IT WAS,

01:52:09.022 --> 01:52:11.124
THEY WERE BOTH ABLE TO OPEN UP

01:52:11.191 --> 01:52:12.192
AND PROVIDE. AND I'M HAPPY TO

01:52:12.258 --> 01:52:13.493
SAY THAT IN THIS PARTICULAR

01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:16.096
CASE, HE IS BACK IN SERVING LIFE

01:52:16.162 --> 01:52:18.932
IN PRISON. BUT WHAT HAPPENS TO

01:52:18.998 --> 01:52:21.167
THOSE GIRLS, RIGHT. HE GETS

01:52:21.234 --> 01:52:22.869
PROSECUTED AND THEN WHAT

01:52:22.936 --> 01:52:24.337
HAPPENS? SO THAT'S WHERE OUR

01:52:24.404 --> 01:52:26.139
TEAMS COME INTO PLAY. YOU KNOW,

01:52:26.206 --> 01:52:27.807
AGAIN, WORKING WITHIN THAT

01:52:27.874 --> 01:52:29.442
MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM

01:52:29.509 --> 01:52:31.478
STRUCTURE, WE WERE ABLE IN THIS

01:52:31.544 --> 01:52:32.812
PARTICULAR CASE TO CONNECT NOT

01:52:32.879 --> 01:52:36.182
ONLY THE MOTHER WHO INITIALLY

01:52:36.249 --> 01:52:37.684
FLED. I FORGOT TO MENTION THIS

01:52:37.750 --> 01:52:38.785
PART. THEY INITIALLY FLED OUT OF

01:52:38.852 --> 01:52:40.386
THE COUNTRY, BUT EVENTUALLY THEY

01:52:40.453 --> 01:52:44.057
WERE BROUGHT BACK. WE HAD THE

01:52:44.124 --> 01:52:47.060
MOTHER RECEIVE SERVICES AND AS

01:52:47.127 --> 01:52:48.361
WELL AS THE GIRLS, EVEN THOUGH

01:52:48.428 --> 01:52:49.929
THEY WERE PLACED IN FOSTER CARE.

01:52:49.996 --> 01:52:51.364
BUT GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF

01:52:51.431 --> 01:52:52.699
THIS, WE KNEW THAT WE COULDN'T

01:52:52.765 --> 01:52:54.667
JUST SEND THEM TO ANY TYPE OF

01:52:54.734 --> 01:52:55.969
THERAPY THEY NEEDED SOMEONE WHO

01:52:56.035 --> 01:52:57.770
REALLY WAS VERY TRAUMA INFORMED

01:52:57.837 --> 01:52:59.606
AND HAD EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH

01:52:59.672 --> 01:53:02.475
COMPLEX TRAUMA CASES AS WELL.

01:53:02.542 --> 01:53:04.043
BUT AGAIN, THESE ARE THE TYPES

01:53:04.110 --> 01:53:06.646
OF CASES WE WORK WITH ON A DAILY

01:53:06.713 --> 01:53:11.751
BASIS. UNFORTUNATE. THE RESOURCE

01:53:11.818 --> 01:53:14.020
CENTER ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:53:14.087 --> 01:53:16.256
FOUND THAT APPROXIMATELY 30 TO

01:53:16.322 --> 01:53:18.324
60% OF THE CASES OF DOMESTIC

01:53:18.391 --> 01:53:20.493
VIOLENCE HAVE A CO-OCCURRENCE OF

01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:21.895
CHILD MALTREATMENT. THOSE

01:53:21.961 --> 01:53:24.130
NUMBERS ARE EXTREMELY TOO HIGH,

01:53:24.197 --> 01:53:26.166
ONE IS TOO HIGH. BUT THIS IS

01:53:26.232 --> 01:53:28.735
RIDICULOUS AND WE NEED TO START

01:53:28.801 --> 01:53:30.937
ADDRESSING THIS WITH UP FRONT

01:53:31.004 --> 01:53:33.106
AND FRONT AND CENTER. AND NOT

01:53:33.173 --> 01:53:35.575
ONLY THAT, PROVIDING IMMEDIATE

01:53:35.642 --> 01:53:37.443
SERVICES. AS MY COLLEAGUE HERE

01:53:37.510 --> 01:53:39.512
HAS ALREADY TALKED ABOUT,

01:53:39.579 --> 01:53:41.748
BECAUSE WE NEED FRONT END HELP,

01:53:41.814 --> 01:53:43.550
WE CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THEY BECOME

01:53:43.616 --> 01:53:45.351
PART OF THE ACES STUDY, BECAUSE

01:53:45.418 --> 01:53:47.520
ONCE THEY'RE THE ACES STUDY,

01:53:47.587 --> 01:53:49.656
IT'S NOT ONLY THEY'RE NOT ONLY I

01:53:49.722 --> 01:53:51.424
DON'T WANT TO SAY LOST CAUSES,

01:53:51.491 --> 01:53:53.560
BUT IT'S MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR

01:53:53.626 --> 01:53:57.830
THEM TO BECOME HEALTHY. AND IT

01:53:57.897 --> 01:53:59.666
BECOMES EXPENSIVE FOR OUR STATE

01:53:59.732 --> 01:54:01.601
AS WELL, BECAUSE YOU ALL, ALL OF

01:54:01.668 --> 01:54:03.803
US SIT HERE AND PAY THROUGH OUR

01:54:03.870 --> 01:54:05.138
TAXES FOR WHATEVER SERVICES WE

01:54:05.205 --> 01:54:06.940
HAVE AT THIS END, WE'RE ON THE

01:54:07.006 --> 01:54:07.974
FRONT END. IF WE PROVIDE THEM

01:54:08.041 --> 01:54:09.008
WITH THE ACCURATE, APPROPRIATE

01:54:09.075 --> 01:54:10.443
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT THEY

01:54:10.510 --> 01:54:14.147
NEED AND WHATEVER ELSE IT IS,

01:54:14.214 --> 01:54:16.883
YOU KNOW, PARENT SUPPORT, THE

01:54:16.950 --> 01:54:18.851
THAT'S WHEN IT WHEN CHILDREN

01:54:18.918 --> 01:54:20.486
ACTUALLY HAVE A FIGHTING CHANCE.

01:54:20.553 --> 01:54:22.722
AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO

01:54:22.789 --> 01:54:23.690
FOR ALL THESE KIDS. AND THAT'S

01:54:23.756 --> 01:54:25.825
KIND OF OUR GOAL AT CHILDREN'S

01:54:25.892 --> 01:54:27.026
ADVOCACY CENTERS IS, AGAIN,

01:54:27.093 --> 01:54:28.494
BRINGING TO LIGHT A SPACE FOR

01:54:28.561 --> 01:54:30.597
THESE CHILDREN TO TALK ABOUT THE

01:54:30.663 --> 01:54:31.564
MOST HEINOUS THINGS THAT THEY'VE

01:54:31.631 --> 01:54:33.466
NOT ONLY WITNESSED, BUT WHAT

01:54:33.533 --> 01:54:35.568
THAT THEY HAVE FIRSTHAND

01:54:35.635 --> 01:54:38.671
EXPERIENCED. SO, YES, MAY I, I

01:54:38.738 --> 01:54:41.040
WANT TO WELCOME ASSEMBLYMEMBER

01:54:41.107 --> 01:54:42.108
AARON'S AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER

01:54:42.175 --> 01:54:43.109
ALANIZ. THANK YOU FOR BEING

01:54:43.176 --> 01:54:44.277
HERE. WE ALL UNDERSTAND

01:54:44.344 --> 01:54:46.079
EVERYBODY'S PING PONG ING BACK

01:54:46.145 --> 01:54:47.914
AND FORTH, BUT WE'RE HAVING A

01:54:47.981 --> 01:54:48.982
GREAT CONVERSATION. AND, YOU

01:54:49.048 --> 01:54:53.653
KNOW, KIND OF. I ALWAYS FIND

01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:56.122
THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO HEAR

01:54:56.189 --> 01:54:57.957
THE STORIES THAT YOU ALL ARE

01:54:58.024 --> 01:55:00.560
TELLING. AND FOR US, WE GET TO

01:55:00.627 --> 01:55:02.695
HEAR THEM AND GO ON ABOUT OUR

01:55:02.762 --> 01:55:05.665
DAY. AND I'VE KNOWN SUSIE FOR A

01:55:05.732 --> 01:55:07.734
LONG TIME AND JENNICA FOR A LONG

01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:08.735
TIME. AND, YOU KNOW, THE

01:55:08.801 --> 01:55:10.870
QUESTION FOR, FOR SUSIE IS YOU

01:55:10.937 --> 01:55:13.873
TALKED ABOUT ONE SPECIFIC CASE.

01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:17.377
HOW MANY THIS IS WHAT REALLY

01:55:17.443 --> 01:55:18.745
KILLS ME WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

01:55:18.811 --> 01:55:20.647
THESE THINGS. BUT WE HAVE TO

01:55:20.713 --> 01:55:22.749
TALK ABOUT IT. HOW MANY CASES DO

01:55:22.815 --> 01:55:25.251
YOU THINK OR DO YOU HAVE PER

01:55:25.318 --> 01:55:29.289
WEEK ON AVERAGE? ON AVERAGE. SO

01:55:29.355 --> 01:55:31.891
I, AN INTERVIEWER, CAN INTERVIEW

01:55:31.958 --> 01:55:33.993
ANYWHERE BETWEEN 3 TO 4 A DAY.

01:55:34.060 --> 01:55:36.429
OH MY GOD TIMES FIVE. RIGHT. AND

01:55:36.496 --> 01:55:38.298
THAT'S THAT. THAT'S THAT. WE'RE

01:55:38.364 --> 01:55:39.732
HAVING TO SET THOSE LIMITS FOR

01:55:39.799 --> 01:55:40.767
OUR FORENSIC INTERVIEWERS

01:55:40.833 --> 01:55:42.235
BECAUSE WE ALSO NEED TO PROTECT

01:55:42.302 --> 01:55:44.537
THEIR EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING.

01:55:44.604 --> 01:55:46.572
THERE IS AN INFLUX OF CASES WE

01:55:46.639 --> 01:55:47.907
HAVE IN OUR COUNTY. IN LOS

01:55:47.974 --> 01:55:50.610
ANGELES COUNTY, WE HAVE SEVEN

01:55:50.677 --> 01:55:51.711
CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY CENTERS. BUT

01:55:51.778 --> 01:55:54.047
I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THAT IS

01:55:54.113 --> 01:55:55.515
NOT ENOUGH. IT IS DEFINITELY NOT

01:55:55.581 --> 01:55:59.152
ENOUGH. WE NEED MORE BECAUSE

01:55:59.218 --> 01:56:00.386
UNFORTUNATELY, THESE CASES DO

01:56:00.453 --> 01:56:02.755
NOT STOP COMING. WELL, AND I'M

01:56:02.822 --> 01:56:03.823
SURE THAT THEY DON'T TAKE

01:56:03.890 --> 01:56:05.325
WEEKENDS OFF EITHER. CORRECT?

01:56:05.391 --> 01:56:06.693
CORRECT. YEAH. LIKE OUR CENTER,

01:56:06.759 --> 01:56:09.295
WE ACTUALLY OFFER EMERGENCY

01:56:09.362 --> 01:56:10.363
SERVICES. THAT INCLUDES MONDAY

01:56:10.430 --> 01:56:11.297
THROUGH FRIDAY. ANYTHING AFTER

01:56:11.364 --> 01:56:13.499
TEN ON WEEKENDS BECAUSE WE'VE

01:56:13.566 --> 01:56:14.701
UNFORTUNATELY HAD CASES COME

01:56:14.767 --> 01:56:16.102
THROUGH WHERE THEY'VE BEEN

01:56:16.169 --> 01:56:18.171
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE TURNING INTO

01:56:18.237 --> 01:56:19.806
HOMICIDE CASE. AND SO WE GET

01:56:19.872 --> 01:56:21.307
CALLED FOR EMERGENCY CASES AS

01:56:21.374 --> 01:56:23.109
WELL TO INTERVIEW THOSE CHILDREN

01:56:23.176 --> 01:56:24.744
ON WHATEVER THEY MAY HAVE

01:56:24.811 --> 01:56:25.878
WITNESSED. RIGHT. WELL, AND THE

01:56:25.945 --> 01:56:27.280
REASON THAT I ASKED THAT IS

01:56:27.347 --> 01:56:28.681
BECAUSE EVERY TIME, YOU KNOW, I

01:56:28.748 --> 01:56:31.651
THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU ALL DO, I

01:56:31.718 --> 01:56:34.454
JUST CANNOT IMAGINE, I, I KNOW

01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:36.222
THAT WE ALL SERVE A PURPOSE, BUT

01:56:36.289 --> 01:56:38.725
WHAT YOU DO IS SO AMAZING AND I

01:56:38.791 --> 01:56:41.294
CANNOT EXPRESS TO YOU THE

01:56:41.361 --> 01:56:42.862
GRATITUDE THAT I FEEL FOR, FOR

01:56:42.929 --> 01:56:44.597
THE KIND OF WORK THAT YOU DO.

01:56:44.664 --> 01:56:46.399
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW, HONESTLY,

01:56:46.466 --> 01:56:47.633
IF I COULD DO IT, YOU KNOW,

01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:48.901
HEARING YOUR STORIES AND HEARING

01:56:48.968 --> 01:56:50.937
WHAT YOU SEE AND EXPERIENCE ON A

01:56:51.003 --> 01:56:55.308
DAILY BASIS IS. SO MUCH

01:56:55.375 --> 01:56:56.642
SOMETIMES THAT I WONDER ABOUT

01:56:56.709 --> 01:56:57.710
YOUR MENTAL HEALTH. SOMETIMES,

01:56:57.777 --> 01:56:59.846
YOU KNOW, TO THE POINT THAT

01:56:59.912 --> 01:57:01.481
YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE IS THAT

01:57:01.547 --> 01:57:02.348
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO, YOU KNOW,

01:57:02.415 --> 01:57:03.883
FIVE YOU LIMIT TO FIVE

01:57:03.950 --> 01:57:06.152
INTERVIEWS PER DAY. WELL, I YOU

01:57:06.219 --> 01:57:07.987
KNOW, THAT'S JUST ONE PERSON CAN

01:57:08.054 --> 01:57:10.923
SEE 30 PEOPLE. YES. THANK YOU.

01:57:10.990 --> 01:57:13.760
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIBSON I JUST

01:57:13.826 --> 01:57:16.829
WANT TO SAY THAT I HAVE TO GO,

01:57:16.896 --> 01:57:17.663
BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO

01:57:17.730 --> 01:57:18.531
EVERYONE. I WAS A FORMER POLICE

01:57:18.598 --> 01:57:19.465
OFFICER. AND SOMETIMES AND I

01:57:19.532 --> 01:57:21.701
KNOW MY COLLEAGUE HERE WAS A

01:57:21.768 --> 01:57:23.403
FORMER POLICE OFFICER AS WELL.

01:57:23.469 --> 01:57:25.605
THESE ARE CALLS THAT I DREAD

01:57:25.671 --> 01:57:29.842
GOING TO. AND SOMETIME WE HAVE

01:57:29.909 --> 01:57:31.677
TO. IT'S DIFFICULT FOR US TO GO

01:57:31.744 --> 01:57:33.813
INTO A HOUSE WHERE THE FATHER IS

01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:36.149
THE ABUSER, AND WE HAD TO GO

01:57:36.215 --> 01:57:38.684
INTO AND REMOVE THE CHILD AND

01:57:38.751 --> 01:57:41.821
HAD TO DEAL WITH. SOMETIMES THE

01:57:41.888 --> 01:57:44.690
MOTHER WHO WOULD SHIELD THE

01:57:44.757 --> 01:57:46.325
CHILD AND PROTECT THE CHILD,

01:57:46.392 --> 01:57:49.262
BECAUSE THE FATHER IS THE SOLE

01:57:49.328 --> 01:57:53.699
PROVIDER. AND WHEN WE HAD TO

01:57:53.766 --> 01:57:55.435
TAKE THE FATHER OUT OF THE HOME,

01:57:55.501 --> 01:57:57.603
THEN THAT TOOK AWAY THE

01:57:57.670 --> 01:57:59.439
FINANCIAL RESPONSE, RIGHT. YOU

01:57:59.505 --> 01:58:01.240
FOLLOW ME. AND SO THAT MADE IT

01:58:01.307 --> 01:58:02.742
VERY DIFFICULT. BUT WE HAD TO

01:58:02.809 --> 01:58:04.510
BECAUSE WE WERE THE MANDATED

01:58:04.577 --> 01:58:05.812
REPORTER THAT WE HAD TO DO OUR

01:58:05.878 --> 01:58:08.314
JOB. AND THAT MADE IT VERY, VERY

01:58:08.381 --> 01:58:10.216
DIFFICULT. BUT WE HAD TO REMOVE

01:58:10.283 --> 01:58:13.085
BECAUSE HE WAS THE ABUSER IN THE

01:58:13.152 --> 01:58:14.854
HOME AND THAT CAUSED THE

01:58:14.921 --> 01:58:17.423
DISRUPTION. BUT WE HAD TO AND IT

01:58:17.490 --> 01:58:19.959
WAS VERY, VERY DIFFICULT FOR US

01:58:20.026 --> 01:58:23.529
IN UNIFORM TO DO THAT BECAUSE WE

01:58:23.596 --> 01:58:25.698
KNEW WHAT, WHAT, WHAT WOULD BE

01:58:25.765 --> 01:58:27.834
FACED WITH. RIGHT. AND IT WAS

01:58:27.900 --> 01:58:29.202
DIFFICULT TO SEE THE CHILD WHO

01:58:29.268 --> 01:58:31.471
WAS BEING ABUSED. AND FOR US WHO

01:58:31.537 --> 01:58:34.607
WERE FATHERS AS WELL, TO PUT

01:58:34.674 --> 01:58:36.476
OURSELVES IN THAT SITUATION.

01:58:36.542 --> 01:58:39.812
RIGHT, AND NOT TRY TO LAY HANDS

01:58:39.879 --> 01:58:42.582
ON HIM AS THE ABUSER OF A CHILD

01:58:42.648 --> 01:58:44.784
WHO WAS VERY INNOCENT IN THAT

01:58:44.851 --> 01:58:46.819
WHOLE SITUATION. SO I COMMEND

01:58:46.886 --> 01:58:49.789
YOU FOR ALL YOUR TRANSPARENCY

01:58:49.856 --> 01:58:51.591
AND ALSO APPEARING AND LETTING

01:58:51.657 --> 01:58:53.426
US KNOW, AND GIVING US A GLIMPSE

01:58:53.493 --> 01:58:55.561
OF WHAT YOU HAVE TO EXPERIENCE

01:58:55.628 --> 01:58:58.231
AS THOSE WHO ARE IN YOUR ROLES

01:58:58.297 --> 01:58:58.865
AND YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES. SO I

01:58:58.931 --> 01:59:00.566
THANK YOU. WE JUST WANT TO

01:59:00.633 --> 01:59:02.034
ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE TO

01:59:02.101 --> 01:59:05.004
ENGAGE WITH US AND KEEP US, YOU

01:59:05.071 --> 01:59:06.372
KNOW, CONNECTED TO THE WORK THAT

01:59:06.439 --> 01:59:08.641
YOU DO SO THAT WE WILL KNOW HOW

01:59:08.708 --> 01:59:09.976
TO CONTINUE TO LEGISLATE IN

01:59:10.042 --> 01:59:12.745
THESE SPACES SO THAT WE CAN BE

01:59:12.812 --> 01:59:14.514
THE PROTECTOR AND CONTINUE TO BE

01:59:14.580 --> 01:59:16.415
THE PROVIDER IN THESE KINDS OF

01:59:16.482 --> 01:59:17.817
POLICY SPACES. SO THANK YOU VERY

01:59:17.884 --> 01:59:19.552

LATE. OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE OTHER

01:59:26.592 --> 01:59:27.960
COMMITTEES GOING ON RIGHT NOW. I

01:59:28.027 --> 01:59:30.363
APOLOGIZE, I, I WANTED TO MAKE

01:59:30.429 --> 01:59:32.632
SURE I MADE IT AT LEAST AN

01:59:32.698 --> 01:59:34.000
APPEARANCE HERE TO BE HERE AND

01:59:34.066 --> 01:59:35.067
BE PART OF THIS. MY BACKGROUND,

01:59:35.134 --> 01:59:37.069
AS MENTIONED EARLIER, 25 PLUS

01:59:37.136 --> 01:59:39.472
YEARS. SHERIFF'S OFFICE. I ALSO

01:59:39.539 --> 01:59:41.440
AM A FORENSIC INTERVIEWER, AND I

01:59:41.507 --> 01:59:43.476
WAS A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:59:43.543 --> 01:59:44.844
DETECTIVE ALONG WITH CRIMES

01:59:44.911 --> 01:59:46.345
AGAINST CHILDREN'S DETECTIVE. SO

01:59:46.412 --> 01:59:47.713
I WORKED WITH OUR LOCAL

01:59:47.780 --> 01:59:48.414
STANISLAUS FAMILY JUSTICE

01:59:48.481 --> 01:59:50.616
CENTER, WORKING WITH COLLEAGUES

01:59:50.683 --> 01:59:51.684
FROM OTHER AGENCIES AND HELPING

01:59:51.751 --> 01:59:54.453
THEM OUT AS WELL. I'M VERY HAPPY

01:59:54.520 --> 01:59:56.088
THAT THIS COMMITTEE IS

01:59:56.155 --> 01:59:57.156
HAPPENING. I'M WE'RE GOING TO

01:59:57.223 --> 01:59:59.992
NEED YOUR HELP. DEFINITELY. I'M

02:00:00.059 --> 02:00:01.727
THE CHAIR OF PUBLIC SAFETY, HAVE

02:00:01.794 --> 02:00:03.663
BEEN FOR THREE YEARS NOW, AND

02:00:03.729 --> 02:00:05.231
WE'VE HAD MANY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

02:00:05.298 --> 02:00:06.699
BILLS THAT I HAVE WATCHED NOT

02:00:06.766 --> 02:00:11.704
PASS. I HAVE WATCHED. BASICALLY,

02:00:11.771 --> 02:00:13.639
THE VICTIM'S VOICE IS SILENCED

02:00:13.706 --> 02:00:19.412
AND THE ABUSER. VERY PROTECTED.

02:00:19.478 --> 02:00:21.247
I'VE HEARD WHERE THE SURVIVOR

02:00:21.314 --> 02:00:23.049
COULD JUST GO TO MORE COUNSELING

02:00:23.115 --> 02:00:25.651
AND WE CAN LET LET THE ABUSER

02:00:25.718 --> 02:00:26.719
OUT BECAUSE THE ABUSER NEEDS TO

02:00:26.786 --> 02:00:28.321
BE OUT. BUT BUT THEY DIDN'T

02:00:28.387 --> 02:00:29.655
UNDERSTAND. THIS IS SOMETHING

02:00:29.722 --> 02:00:30.823
THAT I WAS TRYING TO EXPLAIN, IS

02:00:30.890 --> 02:00:33.426
I KNOW WHEN MY SURVIVORS WOULD

02:00:33.492 --> 02:00:34.327
CALL ME ON MY CASELOADS, THAT

02:00:34.393 --> 02:00:35.962
THEY WERE IN FEAR THAT THEY

02:00:36.028 --> 02:00:37.430
LIVED IN A LIVING HELL,

02:00:37.496 --> 02:00:38.631
BASICALLY. RIGHT. I THINK HE'S

02:00:38.698 --> 02:00:40.800
OUT. I THINK HE GOT OUT. I'M

02:00:40.866 --> 02:00:41.867
LIKE, I WOULD CHECK. NO, HE'S

02:00:41.934 --> 02:00:43.636
STILL IN. AND YEAH, WE HAVE WE

02:00:43.703 --> 02:00:45.271
HAVE A SYSTEM SET THAT WILL WILL

02:00:45.338 --> 02:00:46.472
NOTIFY THEM WHEN THEY'RE

02:00:46.539 --> 02:00:47.573
RELEASED. BUT MAYBE SOMETIMES

02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:48.741
THEY THINK THEY MISSED THE PHONE

02:00:48.808 --> 02:00:49.609
CALL. AND SO THEY, THEY'RE

02:00:49.675 --> 02:00:51.577
CONSTANTLY IN FEAR FOR THEM AND

02:00:51.644 --> 02:00:53.412
THEIR CHILDREN. I KNOW WE'VE

02:00:53.479 --> 02:00:54.647
ALSO HAD SOME LAWS WHERE WE HAVE

02:00:54.714 --> 02:00:55.815
SOME, SOME BILLS THAT WE HAVE

02:00:55.881 --> 02:00:57.516
TRYING TO MAKE LAWS TO WHERE YOU

02:00:57.583 --> 02:00:59.218
CAN DELAY IN REPORTING TO

02:00:59.285 --> 02:01:00.486
PROTECT, BECAUSE WE KNOW A LOT

02:01:00.553 --> 02:01:01.988
OF THE SURVIVORS ALSO ARE NOT

02:01:02.054 --> 02:01:03.456
REPORTING BECAUSE THEY WANT TO

02:01:03.522 --> 02:01:04.690
THEY WANT TO PROTECT THEIR

02:01:04.757 --> 02:01:06.092
CHILDREN. RIGHT. HAD MANY CASES

02:01:06.158 --> 02:01:07.093
WHERE OBVIOUSLY THE ABUSER ALSO

02:01:07.159 --> 02:01:08.661
KILLED THE KIDS, RIGHT? YOU'RE

02:01:08.728 --> 02:01:10.596
NOT. IF I DON'T GET THEM, THEN

02:01:10.663 --> 02:01:11.998
NOBODY GETS THEM KIND OF THING.

02:01:12.064 --> 02:01:14.567
SO I JUST WANT TO EXPRESS MY, MY

02:01:14.634 --> 02:01:17.403
SINCERE. I'M THANKFUL THAT YOU

02:01:17.470 --> 02:01:19.772
GUYS ARE HERE. I'M THANKFUL THAT

02:01:19.839 --> 02:01:20.573
THIS IS HAPPENING. AND I'M SURE

02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:22.241
THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THIS

02:01:22.308 --> 02:01:23.809
TOGETHER. I'M SURE THERE'LL BE A

02:01:23.876 --> 02:01:26.145
LOT MORE CONVERSATIONS AS WELL.

02:01:26.212 --> 02:01:26.779
AND JUST LETTING YOU GUYS KNOW

02:01:26.846 --> 02:01:28.514
THAT I'M HERE TO HELP. I WILL

02:01:28.581 --> 02:01:29.782
USE MY EXPERIENCE UP HERE AS

02:01:29.849 --> 02:01:32.351
MUCH AS I CAN, AND I'M TRYING AS

02:01:32.418 --> 02:01:33.686
HARD AS I CAN. THANK YOU SO

02:01:33.753 --> 02:01:35.121
MUCH. AND WE'LL PULL IT WHAT

02:01:35.187 --> 02:01:36.522
THEY CALL A PIN ON, BECAUSE YOU

02:01:36.589 --> 02:01:38.157
TALKED ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

02:01:38.224 --> 02:01:40.459
LAWS THAT THAT HAVE DIED IN

02:01:40.526 --> 02:01:41.827
COMMITTEE OR BILLS THAT HAVE

02:01:41.894 --> 02:01:43.229
DIED IN COMMITTEE. ONE OF THE

02:01:43.295 --> 02:01:45.097
QUESTIONS FOR THE GROUP LEADER A

02:01:45.164 --> 02:01:46.532
LITTLE BIT LATER IS ON THE

02:01:46.599 --> 02:01:48.134
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. I THINK

02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:49.402
THAT'S REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT

02:01:49.468 --> 02:01:51.971
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT OUR LAWS

02:01:52.038 --> 02:01:53.706
DON'T NECESSARILY SUPPORT THE

02:01:53.773 --> 02:01:56.575
VICTIMS BECAUSE FOR WHATEVER

02:01:56.642 --> 02:01:58.310
REASON, AND, YOU KNOW, OUR JOB

02:01:58.377 --> 02:02:00.579
UP HERE IS TO TRY AND CHANGE

02:02:00.646 --> 02:02:03.549
THOSE. SO I WANT TO PUT THAT IN

02:02:03.616 --> 02:02:05.284
IN YOUR MIND. AND THEN WE'LL

02:02:05.351 --> 02:02:06.986
HAVE DOCTOR TATE CONTINUE THE

02:02:07.053 --> 02:02:07.787
CONVERSATION, AND MAYBE WE'LL

02:02:07.853 --> 02:02:10.222
HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO DO

02:02:10.289 --> 02:02:11.791
A BACK AND FORTH. THANK YOU,

02:02:11.857 --> 02:02:13.426
DOCTOR TATE. WELCOME. HI. I AM

02:02:13.492 --> 02:02:14.994
DOCTOR PAMELA TATE FROM BLACK

02:02:15.061 --> 02:02:16.462
WOMEN REVOLT AGAINST DOMESTIC

02:02:16.529 --> 02:02:18.497
VIOLENCE IN SAN FRANCISCO. WE

02:02:18.564 --> 02:02:21.367
ARE A FOUR YEAR OLD ORGANIZATION

02:02:21.434 --> 02:02:23.369
AND WE ABSOLUTELY LOVE WORKING

02:02:23.436 --> 02:02:26.872
WITH ASSEMBLYWOMAN RUBIO. I FEEL

02:02:26.939 --> 02:02:28.607
LIKE MOST OF WHAT I WAS GOING TO

02:02:28.674 --> 02:02:30.876
SAY HAS BEEN COVERED QUITE

02:02:30.943 --> 02:02:33.412
THOROUGHLY BY MY COLLEAGUES. BUT

02:02:33.479 --> 02:02:35.414
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS I

02:02:35.481 --> 02:02:37.249
DID WANT TO LIFT. I SERVE ON THE

02:02:37.316 --> 02:02:38.651
CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP TO END

02:02:38.718 --> 02:02:41.353
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE POLICY

02:02:41.420 --> 02:02:43.022
ADVISORY COUNCIL FOR THE NEXT

02:02:43.089 --> 02:02:45.491
TWO YEARS. SO I WILL BE LOOKING

02:02:45.558 --> 02:02:47.326
TO MY FRIEND BACK HERE TO TALK

02:02:47.393 --> 02:02:51.330
ABOUT POLICY. IT'S BEEN AN

02:02:51.397 --> 02:02:52.498
INTERESTING YEAR, AS WE KNOW,

02:02:52.565 --> 02:02:54.500
WITH ALL OF THE TURN OF EVENTS

02:02:54.567 --> 02:02:56.736
AND THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON.

02:02:56.802 --> 02:02:58.838
AND ONE THING I WANTED TO LIFT

02:02:58.904 --> 02:03:00.439
THAT TAYLOR HAD STARTED TO

02:03:00.506 --> 02:03:02.241
MENTION, AND TAYLOR AND I WORKED

02:03:02.308 --> 02:03:05.111
TOGETHER AS WE'RE STARTING TO

02:03:05.177 --> 02:03:07.513
SEE TEENAGERS TÍNH OUT AND

02:03:07.580 --> 02:03:10.416
BECOME YOUNG ADULTS, WE HAD A

02:03:10.483 --> 02:03:12.485
CASE THAT DIDN'T JUST START AT

02:03:12.551 --> 02:03:14.386
SAN FRANCISCO STATE AND I'M A

02:03:14.453 --> 02:03:18.023
GATOR, SO GO GATORS. WE HAD A

02:03:18.090 --> 02:03:20.126
CASE WITH A YOUNG WOMAN WHO DID

02:03:20.192 --> 02:03:23.329
A TAY NAVIGATION CENTER. SHE WAS

02:03:23.395 --> 02:03:24.730
HAVING TROUBLES WITH HER

02:03:24.797 --> 02:03:26.532
PARTNER. SHE WENT INTO THIS

02:03:26.599 --> 02:03:28.033
NAVIGATION CENTER. SHE STILL

02:03:28.100 --> 02:03:30.936
MANAGED TO ATTEND COLLEGE. AND

02:03:31.003 --> 02:03:32.705
ONE SEMESTER BEFORE SHE WAS DUE

02:03:32.772 --> 02:03:34.140
TO GRADUATE, HER PARTNER KILLED

02:03:34.206 --> 02:03:38.210
HER. AND SO WE GET A TELEPHONE

02:03:38.277 --> 02:03:40.279
CALL AND FIND OUT THAT SHE HAD

02:03:40.346 --> 02:03:41.614
ACTUALLY KIND OF GONE THROUGH

02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:44.917
OUR TRIAGE FOR RESOURCES, HAD

02:03:44.984 --> 02:03:46.719
ASSOCIATED WITH A SHELTER IN SAN

02:03:46.786 --> 02:03:48.387
FRANCISCO, THIRD STREET YOUTH.

02:03:48.454 --> 02:03:50.222
AND THEN, OF COURSE, SHE'S A

02:03:50.289 --> 02:03:52.124
STUDENT AT SAN FRANCISCO STATE.

02:03:52.191 --> 02:03:54.326
AND I WILL SELF DISCLOSE, WHEN I

02:03:54.393 --> 02:03:56.495
WAS IN COLLEGE AT SAN FRANCISCO

02:03:56.562 --> 02:03:58.597
STATE AS A 19 YEAR OLD YOUNG

02:03:58.664 --> 02:04:01.500
WOMAN, I WAS ATTACKED AND I WAS

02:04:01.567 --> 02:04:03.602
RAPED. THERE WAS NO WOMEN'S

02:04:03.669 --> 02:04:05.871
CENTER. THERE IS A WOMEN'S

02:04:05.938 --> 02:04:07.339
CENTER NOW. THEY ARE STILL JUST

02:04:07.406 --> 02:04:09.842
AS INEFFECTIVE AS NOT HAVING

02:04:09.909 --> 02:04:12.711
ONE. THEY HAVE TITLE NINE

02:04:12.778 --> 02:04:14.947
OFFICERS WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO

02:04:15.014 --> 02:04:16.782
SUPPORT AND HELP, AND THE FIRST

02:04:16.849 --> 02:04:18.584
THING THEY DO IS REACH OUT TO

02:04:18.651 --> 02:04:20.286
COMMUNITY AND ASK FOR

02:04:20.352 --> 02:04:21.654
ASSISTANCE. I DON'T WANT TO PUT

02:04:21.720 --> 02:04:23.556
THE ONUS BACK ON TEACHERS

02:04:23.622 --> 02:04:25.324
BECAUSE TEACHERS ARE TEACHING

02:04:25.391 --> 02:04:27.493
THE A THROUGH G. THAT IS THEIR

02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:29.328
JOB. WE'RE ASKING TEACHERS TO

02:04:29.395 --> 02:04:30.629
PROTECT CHILDREN IN CLASSROOMS

02:04:30.696 --> 02:04:32.765
FROM GUNS. WE'RE ASKING TEACHERS

02:04:32.832 --> 02:04:35.367
TO PROTECT STUDENTS FROM SEXUAL

02:04:35.434 --> 02:04:37.136
ASSAULTS FROM PEERS, OR ASKING

02:04:37.203 --> 02:04:39.839
TEACHERS TO TAKE ON ALL OF THESE

02:04:39.905 --> 02:04:40.372
RESPONSIBILITIES THAT ARE

02:04:40.439 --> 02:04:42.241
OUTSIDE OF WHAT THEY WENT TO

02:04:42.308 --> 02:04:43.742
COLLEGE TO DO, WHICH WAS TO

02:04:43.809 --> 02:04:45.344
EDUCATE CHILDREN, NOT

02:04:45.411 --> 02:04:48.013
NECESSARILY TO TEACH VALUES, BUT

02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:50.182
OF COURSE, TO SUPPORT FAMILY

02:04:50.249 --> 02:04:52.251
VALUES. BUT IT'S NOT THEIR JOB

02:04:52.318 --> 02:04:53.085
TO TEACH. AND SO WHEN THE

02:04:53.152 --> 02:04:54.486
QUESTION CAME UP AROUND, WHAT

02:04:54.553 --> 02:04:56.555
CAN WE DO TO SUPPORT? I THINK

02:04:56.622 --> 02:04:59.825
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT

02:04:59.892 --> 02:05:01.594
TEACHERS HAVE A ROLE AND THEY DO

02:05:01.660 --> 02:05:03.796
A GREAT JOB. BUT TEACHERS ARE

02:05:03.863 --> 02:05:06.398
ALSO STRETCHED PRETTY THIN, JUST

02:05:06.465 --> 02:05:08.067
LIKE FORENSIC INTERVIEWERS ARE

02:05:08.133 --> 02:05:10.269
STRETCHED PRETTY THIN. RESOURCE

02:05:10.336 --> 02:05:12.071
WORKERS ARE STRETCHED PRETTY

02:05:12.137 --> 02:05:14.874
THIN. YOUTH ADVOCATES ARE

02:05:14.940 --> 02:05:18.577
STRETCHED PRETTY THIN. THERE'S

02:05:18.644 --> 02:05:19.578
MONEY. AND WE LIKE TO SAY THAT

02:05:19.645 --> 02:05:22.181
IT DOESN'T COME DOWN TO MONEY.

02:05:22.248 --> 02:05:23.649
AT THE END OF THE DAY, I THINK

02:05:23.716 --> 02:05:25.050
THAT WE ARE FRYING PEOPLE AND

02:05:25.117 --> 02:05:27.486
BURNING PEOPLE OUT. I THINK IT'S

02:05:27.553 --> 02:05:29.355
SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO LOOK

02:05:29.421 --> 02:05:31.156
AT AND DOING FIVE INTERVIEWS,

02:05:31.223 --> 02:05:32.625
FORENSIC INTERVIEWS. I KNOW WE

02:05:32.691 --> 02:05:35.761
HAVE A CAP OF THREE CLIENTS

02:05:35.828 --> 02:05:37.796
NHIÀU PER MONTH, JUST BECAUSE OF

02:05:37.863 --> 02:05:40.132
THE INTENSIVE SERVICES THAT WE

02:05:40.199 --> 02:05:42.534
PROVIDE. I COULD NOT IMAGINE

02:05:42.601 --> 02:05:45.204
DOING FIVE FORENSIC INTERVIEWS A

02:05:45.271 --> 02:05:47.673
DAY WITH THE TYPE OF TRAUMA AND

02:05:47.740 --> 02:05:48.841
EXPERIENCES AND THINGS THAT ARE

02:05:48.908 --> 02:05:50.643
BEING SHARED WITH THE FORENSIC

02:05:50.709 --> 02:05:52.811
INTERVIEWER, SO I DO WANT TO

02:05:52.878 --> 02:05:54.213
LIFT THAT. AND AGAIN, KNOWING

02:05:54.280 --> 02:05:56.415
THE TIMES ARE DIFFERENT, THE

02:05:56.482 --> 02:05:58.817
FUNDING SOURCES ARE DIFFERENT. I

02:05:58.884 --> 02:06:01.220
WISH THAT WE CAN DO A LITTLE BIT

02:06:01.287 --> 02:06:02.755
MORE COLLABORATION TO FIGURE OUT

02:06:02.821 --> 02:06:05.357
HOW WE CAN CARRY AND SHARE

02:06:05.424 --> 02:06:07.793
CASELOAD, AND AS YOU MENTIONED,

02:06:07.860 --> 02:06:09.728
IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET INTO

02:06:09.795 --> 02:06:10.829
SCHOOL DISTRICTS. IT TOOK US

02:06:10.896 --> 02:06:12.665
WE'RE FOUR YEARS OLD. IT TOOK US

02:06:12.731 --> 02:06:14.400
TWO AND A HALF YEARS TO GET INTO

02:06:14.466 --> 02:06:15.901
SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED SCHOOL

02:06:15.968 --> 02:06:17.803
DISTRICT, AND I HAD A TEACHING

02:06:17.870 --> 02:06:18.437
CREDENTIAL THAT WAS AFFILIATED

02:06:18.504 --> 02:06:19.838
WITH WITH THE DISTRICT. AND SO

02:06:19.905 --> 02:06:22.207
IT IS DIFFICULT, BUT I THINK

02:06:22.274 --> 02:06:23.642
THAT ONCE YOU GET IN THERE AND

02:06:23.709 --> 02:06:25.544
THE WAYS THAT WE NAVIGATE TO GET

02:06:25.611 --> 02:06:27.813
INTO SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE TO BE

02:06:27.880 --> 02:06:30.015
UNIQUE, I.E. GOING WITH

02:06:30.082 --> 02:06:32.351
ATHLETES. FOR ME, I GOT IN AS A

02:06:32.418 --> 02:06:34.820
RESULT OF MY OWN DAUGHTER HAVING

02:06:34.887 --> 02:06:37.289
WITNESSED A STUDENT WHO PUNCHED

02:06:37.356 --> 02:06:39.658
HIS GIRLFRIEND UP IN THE UPPER

02:06:39.725 --> 02:06:41.360
CAMPUS, AND IT WAS WITNESSED.

02:06:41.427 --> 02:06:43.595
AND SO I WALKED DIRECTLY TO THE

02:06:43.662 --> 02:06:44.663
PRINCIPAL AND SAID, YOU HAVE AN

02:06:44.730 --> 02:06:46.532
ISSUE HERE, AND THIS IS THE WORK

02:06:46.598 --> 02:06:48.767
THAT I DO, AND I'M HAPPY TO COME

02:06:48.834 --> 02:06:50.736
HERE AND SERVE AT SCHOOL, WHICH

02:06:50.803 --> 02:06:51.937
WOUND UP WITH ME DOING TWO HOURS

02:06:52.004 --> 02:06:53.872
A WEEK DURING MY LUNCH HOUR. AND

02:06:53.939 --> 02:06:55.507
MY BOSS WAS VERY GRACIOUS AND

02:06:55.574 --> 02:06:57.443
SAID, GO AHEAD AND DO IT. BUT I

02:06:57.509 --> 02:06:59.478
WOUND UP DOING IT FOR TWO YEARS

02:06:59.545 --> 02:07:00.779
FOR FREE. EVERYBODY DOESN'T HAVE

02:07:00.846 --> 02:07:01.580
THAT LUXURY. EVERYBODY DOES NOT

02:07:01.647 --> 02:07:03.782
HAVE A BOSS THAT'S THAT KIND.

02:07:03.849 --> 02:07:07.319
AND SO I WISH THAT THERE WAS A

02:07:07.386 --> 02:07:08.954
WAY FOR US TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

02:07:09.021 --> 02:07:10.122
DO MORE COLLABORATIVE THINGS

02:07:10.189 --> 02:07:11.657
THAT ARE SUPPORTIVE OF

02:07:11.724 --> 02:07:14.526
EDUCATORS, TEACHERS, DV CENTERS,

02:07:14.593 --> 02:07:17.496
RESOURCE CENTERS, AND THE LIKE I

02:07:17.563 --> 02:07:18.897
WAS SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT. AND

02:07:18.964 --> 02:07:20.632
I'M GOING TO GET BACK TO WHAT

02:07:20.699 --> 02:07:22.167
I'M SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT,

02:07:22.234 --> 02:07:24.570
THINGS THAT WE NOTICE IN TERMS

02:07:24.636 --> 02:07:26.672
OF CHILDREN AND IMPACT ON

02:07:26.739 --> 02:07:28.374
CHILDREN. I'M GOING TO GO TO

02:07:28.440 --> 02:07:29.775
INFANTS. SINCE YOU ALL KIND OF

02:07:29.842 --> 02:07:31.810
WENT TO OLDER PEOPLE. WE HAVE A

02:07:31.877 --> 02:07:32.911
GROUP THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY

02:07:32.978 --> 02:07:34.213
RUNNING THROUGH, HOMELESS

02:07:34.279 --> 02:07:35.814
PRENATAL, WHERE WE WORK WITH

02:07:35.881 --> 02:07:38.650
THEM, AND IT'S A GROUP OF NEW TO

02:07:38.717 --> 02:07:41.253
BE MOTHERS AND THEN NEW MOTHERS

02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:42.855
POSTPARTUM. IT'S CALLED THURSDAY

02:07:42.921 --> 02:07:44.823
TEA TIME. THEY GET ONLINE THAT

02:07:44.890 --> 02:07:46.492
WAY THEY DON'T HAVE TO BRING

02:07:46.558 --> 02:07:48.394
THEIR CHILDREN IN. AND WE TALK

02:07:48.460 --> 02:07:49.395
ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE

02:07:49.461 --> 02:07:50.362
EXPERIENCING. AS PARENTS. WE

02:07:50.429 --> 02:07:52.264
TALK ABOUT SELF-LOVE, SELF

02:07:52.331 --> 02:07:53.732
ESTEEM. WE MAKE SURE THAT

02:07:53.799 --> 02:07:56.168
THEY'RE NOT GETTING BROKEN DOWN.

02:07:56.235 --> 02:07:58.504
WE TALK ABOUT WHAT ARE FORMS OF

02:07:58.570 --> 02:08:00.239
ABUSE, AND A LOT OF TIMES WE

02:08:00.305 --> 02:08:01.707
DISCOVER THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW

02:08:01.774 --> 02:08:03.108
THAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY IN AN

02:08:03.175 --> 02:08:05.277
ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP. AND WE

02:08:05.344 --> 02:08:06.812
DON'T JUST HEAR THAT AT AN ADULT

02:08:06.879 --> 02:08:08.814
LEVEL. WE HEAR THAT IN KIDS. WE

02:08:08.881 --> 02:08:11.283
HEAR THAT IN TEENS. WE HEAR THAT

02:08:11.350 --> 02:08:12.951
FROM PRINCIPALS. WE HEAR IT FROM

02:08:13.018 --> 02:08:14.987
PIZZAS. PEOPLE ARE JUST NOT

02:08:15.054 --> 02:08:15.587
FAMILIAR. THEY GO, WELL, THEY

02:08:15.654 --> 02:08:17.056
DIDN'T HIT ME. WELL, THAT

02:08:17.122 --> 02:08:18.857
DOESN'T END AND DOESN'T MEAN

02:08:18.924 --> 02:08:21.160
THAT YOU ARE NOT BEING ABUSED.

02:08:21.226 --> 02:08:23.195
AND SO AS WE'RE DOING THIS,

02:08:23.262 --> 02:08:25.030
WE'RE STARTING TO SEE THINGS

02:08:25.097 --> 02:08:27.099
COME UP WHERE THEY'RE SAYING

02:08:27.166 --> 02:08:29.435
THEY WERE VERBALLY ABUSIVE, THEY

02:08:29.501 --> 02:08:31.970
WERE PHYSICALLY ABUSIVE, THEY

02:08:32.037 --> 02:08:35.140
WERE FINANCIALLY ABUSIVE. MY

02:08:35.207 --> 02:08:37.242
PARENTS ARE SAYING THINGS LIKE,

02:08:37.309 --> 02:08:39.144
NOBODY ELSE IS GOING TO WANT

02:08:39.211 --> 02:08:41.513
YOU. MY PARENTS ARE TELLING ME I

02:08:41.580 --> 02:08:42.848
HAVE TO STAY WITH THIS PERSON

02:08:42.915 --> 02:08:44.116
BECAUSE THEY'RE FINANCIALLY

02:08:44.183 --> 02:08:45.918
RESPONSIBLE FOR MYSELF AND MY

02:08:45.984 --> 02:08:47.453
CHILD. AND SO AS WE'RE HEARING

02:08:47.519 --> 02:08:49.154
THESE THINGS, IT'S KIND OF

02:08:49.221 --> 02:08:51.623
MAKING ME AND OUR ORGANIZATION

02:08:51.690 --> 02:08:53.859
KIND OF LOOK AT HOW DO WE SHIFT

02:08:53.926 --> 02:08:55.727
THIS NARRATIVE. AND THERE'S

02:08:55.794 --> 02:08:58.297
WHOLE POCKETS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE

02:08:58.363 --> 02:08:59.865
NOT BEING SPOKEN TO. AND THE

02:08:59.932 --> 02:09:02.367
RESULT IS CHILDREN AND YOUNG

02:09:02.434 --> 02:09:04.236
ADULTS AND ADULTS ARE HAVING

02:09:04.303 --> 02:09:06.071
BABIES. THE BABIES ARE BEING

02:09:06.138 --> 02:09:08.373
BORN WITH LOW BIRTH WEIGHTS.

02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:09.708
THEY'RE BEING BORN. AND YOU CAN

02:09:09.775 --> 02:09:11.643
JUST KIND OF SEE THAT THEY HAVE

02:09:11.710 --> 02:09:12.711
A FLAT AFFECT AND THEY'RE

02:09:12.778 --> 02:09:14.146
DEPRESSED. IT LEADS INTO LITTLE

02:09:14.213 --> 02:09:15.481
LATER ON IN LIFE WITH

02:09:15.547 --> 02:09:17.316
POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS. THEY

02:09:17.382 --> 02:09:19.084
RESPOND TO PEOPLE YELLING. THEY

02:09:19.151 --> 02:09:21.053
HAVE ODD RESPONSES TO SOMEONE

02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:22.554
JUST SAYING SOMETHING LIKE, COME

02:09:22.621 --> 02:09:25.891
HERE. AND WE ALSO ARE

02:09:25.958 --> 02:09:27.326
POST-COVID. SO WE HAVE A WHOLE

02:09:27.392 --> 02:09:30.095
NEW A WHOLE NEW REALM OF THINGS

02:09:30.162 --> 02:09:31.930
THAT PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING

02:09:31.997 --> 02:09:36.335
THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN. AND SO

02:09:36.401 --> 02:09:37.769
AGAIN, LOTS WAS SAID AND YOU

02:09:37.836 --> 02:09:39.538
WERE QUITE THOROUGH. AND I DO

02:09:39.605 --> 02:09:41.840
APPRECIATE IT. I'M JUST FEELING

02:09:41.907 --> 02:09:43.609
LIKE RIGHT NOW WE'RE AT A

02:09:43.675 --> 02:09:44.443
PRECIPICE AND IT'S TIME TO LOOK

02:09:44.510 --> 02:09:46.411
AT HOW WE'RE DOING THINGS AND

02:09:46.478 --> 02:09:47.880
CHANGING THE WAY THAT WE'RE

02:09:47.946 --> 02:09:49.414
DOING THINGS. AND REALLY IT'S

02:09:49.481 --> 02:09:51.550
ABOUT COLLABORATION AND LAWS

02:09:51.617 --> 02:09:53.452
THAT CAN HELP. WE HAVE THINGS

02:09:53.519 --> 02:09:55.487
THAT ARE IN PLACE, LIKE WE SAY,

02:09:55.554 --> 02:09:57.890
THE CALIFORNIA ACT FOR YOUTH AND

02:09:57.956 --> 02:09:58.991
GETTING THOSE THINGS

02:09:59.057 --> 02:10:00.092
IMPLEMENTED. WE ALSO HAVE THINGS

02:10:00.159 --> 02:10:01.960
THAT SAY, YOU SHOULD HAVE ETHNIC

02:10:02.027 --> 02:10:02.794
STUDIES IN SCHOOLS AND PEOPLE

02:10:02.861 --> 02:10:04.763
ARE ARGUING ABOUT IT. WE JUST

02:10:04.830 --> 02:10:06.265
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

02:10:06.331 --> 02:10:08.400
PROVIDING KIDS WITH A CHANCE.

02:10:08.467 --> 02:10:10.435
YES, AND THAT'S WHERE I'M GOING

02:10:10.502 --> 02:10:13.906
TO END IT. YES. AND I THINK, YOU

02:10:13.972 --> 02:10:16.308
KNOW, LISTENING TO YOU ABOUT

02:10:16.375 --> 02:10:17.543
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE SCHOOLS,

02:10:17.609 --> 02:10:20.546
I DON'T I DIDN'T WANT TO ADD IT,

02:10:20.612 --> 02:10:22.781
BUT I'M GOING TO I HAVE TO SPEAK

02:10:22.848 --> 02:10:24.683
THIS. WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE

02:10:24.750 --> 02:10:27.085
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES IS

02:10:27.152 --> 02:10:28.987
HORRIBLE. WHEN IT WASN'T

02:10:29.054 --> 02:10:32.191
HAPPENING, I HAD A FRIEND WHOSE

02:10:32.257 --> 02:10:35.561
MOTHER WAS MARRIED TO AN ABUSER,

02:10:35.627 --> 02:10:37.496
AND SHE WAS UNDOCUMENTED. SO

02:10:37.563 --> 02:10:40.499
EVERY TIME HE WOULD BEAT HER,

02:10:40.566 --> 02:10:41.967
HE'D SAY, IF YOU TELL ANYBODY,

02:10:42.034 --> 02:10:43.402
I'M JUST GOING TO CALL

02:10:43.468 --> 02:10:44.403
IMMIGRATION. AND THAT WAS BEFORE

02:10:44.469 --> 02:10:47.339
WHAT WE HAVE CURRENTLY. AND SO I

02:10:47.406 --> 02:10:49.775
IMAGINE THAT A LOT OF THE CALLS

02:10:49.841 --> 02:10:51.243
OR MAYBE NOT, THEY'RE AFRAID TO

02:10:51.310 --> 02:10:52.411
CALL, THEY'RE CALLING, THEY'RE

02:10:52.477 --> 02:10:54.146
CALLING, THEY DON'T COME IN AND

02:10:54.213 --> 02:10:55.814
THEY DON'T FOLLOW UP WITH

02:10:55.881 --> 02:10:57.416
SERVICES BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID.

02:10:57.482 --> 02:10:58.784
THEY'RE AFRAID. AND SO, YOU

02:10:58.850 --> 02:11:01.253
KNOW, THAT'S ALSO AN ADDED I

02:11:01.320 --> 02:11:02.654
MEAN, WE'RE GOING THROUGH A LOT

02:11:02.721 --> 02:11:04.623
AT THE MOMENT. BUT BUT, YOU

02:11:04.690 --> 02:11:07.459
KNOW, PARTICULARLY IN THIS SPACE

02:11:07.526 --> 02:11:10.929
WHEN, WHEN YOU NOW HAVE ALL OF

02:11:10.996 --> 02:11:11.797
THESE AMAZING SERVICES AND YET

02:11:11.863 --> 02:11:13.465
YOU CAN'T BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID

02:11:13.532 --> 02:11:15.467
THAT YOUR PARTNER IS GOING TO

02:11:15.534 --> 02:11:17.502
CALL IMMIGRATION. AND, YOU KNOW,

02:11:17.569 --> 02:11:18.971
AND THAT'S A REAL THREAT. AND I

02:11:19.037 --> 02:11:20.772
THINK WE MISS THAT SOMETIMES I

02:11:20.839 --> 02:11:22.608
THINK, YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST BEEN

02:11:22.674 --> 02:11:23.976
SO CRAZY THE LAST FEW MONTHS

02:11:24.042 --> 02:11:25.544
THAT WERE JUST, YOU KNOW, HERE'S

02:11:25.611 --> 02:11:27.879
THIS AND THEN THIS AND THEN

02:11:27.946 --> 02:11:28.947
THIS. BUT I WANTED TO ADD THAT

02:11:29.014 --> 02:11:29.815
TO THAT CONVERSATION, BECAUSE

02:11:29.881 --> 02:11:30.849
THE SERVICES THAT YOU ARE

02:11:30.916 --> 02:11:33.652
PROVIDING ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ARE

02:11:33.719 --> 02:11:35.487
SUPPOSED TO BE, YOU KNOW,

02:11:35.554 --> 02:11:36.288
CONFIDENTIAL. NOBODY'S SUPPOSED

02:11:36.355 --> 02:11:37.689
TO COME INTO YOUR, YOU KNOW,

02:11:37.756 --> 02:11:39.558
CENTERS. AND THAT'S OUT THE

02:11:39.625 --> 02:11:41.260
WINDOW. AND SO OBVIOUSLY YOU

02:11:41.326 --> 02:11:43.428
WON'T HAVE ANSWERS, BUT HOW DO

02:11:43.495 --> 02:11:44.930
YOU IT'S A RHETORICAL QUESTION

02:11:44.997 --> 02:11:47.032
AT THE MOMENT. HOW DO YOU

02:11:47.099 --> 02:11:48.767
NAVIGATE THROUGH, YOU KNOW,

02:11:48.834 --> 02:11:50.302
POLICIES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE

02:11:50.369 --> 02:11:51.837
IN EFFECT AND THAT ARE NOT? I

02:11:51.903 --> 02:11:53.739
MEAN, IT WAS HARD ENOUGH ALREADY

02:11:53.805 --> 02:11:54.906
TO GO THROUGH WHAT YOU WERE

02:11:54.973 --> 02:11:56.708
GOING THROUGH. AND NOW ADD THIS,

02:11:56.775 --> 02:11:59.211
ADDED TO IT AND, YOU KNOW, TO

02:11:59.278 --> 02:11:59.878
THE TEENS. THE TEENS ARE AFRAID

02:11:59.945 --> 02:12:02.881
AS WELL. I HAVE A COUPLE OF

02:12:02.948 --> 02:12:05.417
GIRLS IN MY DISTRICT THAT

02:12:05.484 --> 02:12:06.518
THEY'RE, THEY'RE THEY WERE BORN

02:12:06.585 --> 02:12:08.153
HERE, BUT THE PARENTS ARE

02:12:08.220 --> 02:12:09.721
UNDOCUMENTED. SO THEY'RE HAVING

02:12:09.788 --> 02:12:10.789
TO AND THIS IS NOT YOU KNOW,

02:12:10.856 --> 02:12:12.457
THIS ONE IN PARTICULAR IS NOT A

02:12:12.524 --> 02:12:14.359
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ISSUE.

02:12:14.426 --> 02:12:16.261
HOWEVER, THE TRAUMA IS REAL FOR

02:12:16.328 --> 02:12:18.997
THEM. ONE OF THEM WAS IS IN

02:12:19.064 --> 02:12:21.233
COLLEGE AND LITERALLY SAID TO

02:12:21.300 --> 02:12:23.035
ME, OH, I'M GLAD THAT I DIDN'T

02:12:23.101 --> 02:12:25.604
GO INTO THE DORMS BECAUSE NOW I

02:12:25.671 --> 02:12:27.673
CAN GO AND BUY MY PARENTS

02:12:27.739 --> 02:12:29.474
GROCERIES. AND IT NEVER OCCURRED

02:12:29.541 --> 02:12:31.710
TO ANY OF US THAT THAT WAS A

02:12:31.777 --> 02:12:32.611
THING, YOU KNOW, THAT YOU CAN'T

02:12:32.678 --> 02:12:35.881
JUST PICK UP AND GO AND BUY

02:12:35.947 --> 02:12:36.748
GROCERIES. BUT IF YOU ADD THE

02:12:36.815 --> 02:12:37.382
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COMPONENT OR

02:12:37.449 --> 02:12:39.284
THE CHILD ABUSE COMPONENT, IT'S

02:12:39.351 --> 02:12:41.119
REALLY MESSED UP. I MEAN, THAT'S

02:12:41.186 --> 02:12:43.455
THE ONLY WAY I CAN SAY IT RIGHT

02:12:43.522 --> 02:12:45.390
AT THE MOMENT. AND SO, YOU KNOW,

02:12:45.457 --> 02:12:47.592
THERE'S A LOT I APPRECIATE THE

02:12:47.659 --> 02:12:49.661
WORK THAT YOU ALL DO. AND BUT I

02:12:49.728 --> 02:12:52.164
ALSO WANTED TO TALK ABOUT

02:12:52.230 --> 02:12:53.532
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. I THINK

02:12:53.598 --> 02:12:55.067
THAT'S REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT

02:12:55.133 --> 02:12:55.801
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING THROUGH A

02:12:55.867 --> 02:12:58.670
LOT RIGHT NOW. AND, YOU KNOW, I

02:12:58.737 --> 02:13:01.573
PRAY THAT WE'RE GETTING OUT OF

02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:02.808
WHATEVER IT IS THAT WE'RE IN

02:13:02.874 --> 02:13:04.409
RIGHT NOW. AND ONCE WE GET OUT

02:13:04.476 --> 02:13:06.178
OF THIS, THEN WE'RE GOING TO

02:13:06.244 --> 02:13:07.679
HAVE THE TRAUMA AND WE'RE GOING

02:13:07.746 --> 02:13:09.314
TO HAVE THOSE THOSE LONG LASTING

02:13:09.381 --> 02:13:11.083
EFFECTS. BUT ESPECIALLY STATUTE

02:13:11.149 --> 02:13:15.554
OF LIMITATIONS IS, IS AN ISSUE

02:13:15.620 --> 02:13:17.356
TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER ELENA'S POINT

02:13:17.422 --> 02:13:18.790
FROM EARLIER. A LOT OF THESE

02:13:18.857 --> 02:13:20.559
THESE BILLS THAT WE'VE BEEN

02:13:20.625 --> 02:13:22.828
TRYING TO PASS MYSELF SENATOR

02:13:22.894 --> 02:13:25.397
RUBIO, MY SISTER AND I KNOW A

02:13:25.464 --> 02:13:28.100
LOT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND I KNOW

02:13:28.166 --> 02:13:30.702
ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ, HER

02:13:30.769 --> 02:13:32.637
SON IS A SHERIFF AND DAUGHTER'S

02:13:32.704 --> 02:13:35.073
A NURSE, SO I'M SURE THEY SEE IT

02:13:35.140 --> 02:13:38.643
AS WELL AS WHAT DO YOU THINK? OR

02:13:38.710 --> 02:13:40.712
AND OBVIOUSLY THE TIMELINE IS

02:13:40.779 --> 02:13:42.547
NOT THE SAME FOR EVERYBODY, BUT

02:13:42.614 --> 02:13:45.550
I THINK CURRENTLY WE DON'T HAVE

02:13:45.617 --> 02:13:48.253
STRONG STATUTE OF LIMITATION.

02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:50.055
AND I SAY THAT NICELY BECAUSE

02:13:50.122 --> 02:13:51.456
WE'VE TRIED TO CHANGE IT SEVERAL

02:13:51.523 --> 02:13:53.725
TIMES AND IT DOESN'T HAPPEN. BUT

02:13:53.792 --> 02:13:57.696
HOW LONG? ESPECIALLY FOR

02:13:57.763 --> 02:13:59.131
CHILDREN, SINCE THAT'S THE

02:13:59.197 --> 02:14:00.699
CONVERSATION WE WERE HAVING, IS,

02:14:00.766 --> 02:14:02.667
YOU KNOW, I HAD A CONVERSATION

02:14:02.734 --> 02:14:04.770
WITH YOU EARLIER ABOUT, YOU

02:14:04.836 --> 02:14:07.105
KNOW, CHILDREN DON'T NECESSARILY

02:14:07.172 --> 02:14:08.573
ARE AWARE OR ARE NOT AWARE OF

02:14:08.640 --> 02:14:11.243
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THEM. SO IN

02:14:11.309 --> 02:14:12.711
YOUR EXPERIENCE, I DON'T EVEN

02:14:12.778 --> 02:14:14.913
WANT TO CALL OUT OF TIME. BUT

02:14:14.980 --> 02:14:17.616
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS IMPORTANT

02:14:17.682 --> 02:14:18.917
IN TERMS OF STATUTE OF

02:14:18.984 --> 02:14:19.818
LIMITATIONS? I'LL PUT IT THAT

02:14:19.885 --> 02:14:21.853
WAY. I CAN'T I THINK IF THAT'S

02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:23.288
BEING TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION,

02:14:23.355 --> 02:14:25.056
WE NEED TO INCLUDE MEMORY IN

02:14:25.123 --> 02:14:26.892
THERE. MEMORY PLAYS SUCH A

02:14:26.958 --> 02:14:28.593
SIGNIFICANT ROLE. MEMORY IS NOT

02:14:28.660 --> 02:14:29.995
SOMETHING FLUID. I DON'T PUSH

02:14:30.061 --> 02:14:33.665
PLAY, STOP, REWIND. I DON'T WE

02:14:33.732 --> 02:14:35.200
DON'T HAVE THAT LUXURY OF DOING

02:14:35.267 --> 02:14:37.702
THAT WHEN IT COMES TO MEMORY. SO

02:14:37.769 --> 02:14:40.505
FOR SOME CHILDREN, YOU KNOW, I

02:14:40.572 --> 02:14:42.340
DON'T WANT TO PUT A TIME FRAME

02:14:42.407 --> 02:14:44.543
RIGHT. BECAUSE AGAIN, IT'S IT

02:14:44.609 --> 02:14:46.178
MIGHT COME IN BITS AND PIECES.

02:14:46.244 --> 02:14:49.481
RIGHT. WHAT WAS ENCODED WAS IT

02:14:49.548 --> 02:14:51.750
WERE THEY DETACHED IN THE

02:14:51.817 --> 02:14:53.785
MOMENT. BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THEY

02:14:53.852 --> 02:14:55.987
SURVIVED. AND THEN, YOU KNOW,

02:14:56.054 --> 02:14:56.721
TEN YEARS LATER WHEN THEY'RE

02:14:56.788 --> 02:14:58.557
FINALLY IN A RELATIONSHIP, YOU

02:14:58.623 --> 02:15:02.461
KNOW, THE SENT A WORD, A GESTURE

02:15:02.527 --> 02:15:03.995
CAN TRIGGER ALL OF A SUDDEN A

02:15:04.062 --> 02:15:07.499
FLOOD OF MEMORIES. AND NOW WE'RE

02:15:07.566 --> 02:15:11.837
SEEING. WELL, SORRY IT HAPPENED,

02:15:11.903 --> 02:15:13.772
BUT TIME'S UP. YEAH. YOU PASS A

02:15:13.839 --> 02:15:16.875
DEADLINE. I KNOW ISSUES OF

02:15:16.942 --> 02:15:18.343
COOPERATION COME INTO PLAY.

02:15:18.410 --> 02:15:19.678
RIGHT. AND I THINK ASSEMBLY

02:15:19.744 --> 02:15:21.279
MEMBER CAN SINCE HE WAS LAW

02:15:21.346 --> 02:15:22.714
ENFORCEMENT CAN TOUCH ON THAT AS

02:15:22.781 --> 02:15:25.317
WELL. COOPERATION IS IMPORTANT

02:15:25.383 --> 02:15:27.652
AS WELL. WE NEED TO TAKE THAT

02:15:27.719 --> 02:15:29.187
INTO CONSIDERATION WITH MEMORY.

02:15:29.254 --> 02:15:31.323
WHAT CAN WE GET EVEN AT THIS

02:15:31.389 --> 02:15:34.125
END? BECAUSE OUR STORIES DO

02:15:34.192 --> 02:15:36.428
MATTER. THERE ISN'T A TIME FRAME

02:15:36.495 --> 02:15:38.063
FOR ME JUST BECAUSE THEY DO

02:15:38.129 --> 02:15:39.865
MATTER, AND THERE'S SO MANY

02:15:39.931 --> 02:15:41.566
DIFFERENT LITTLE ELEMENTS THAT

02:15:41.633 --> 02:15:44.636
COME INTO PLAY. YEAH, AND JOYCE,

02:15:44.703 --> 02:15:47.439
I'M LOOKING AT YOU AND YOUR BODY

02:15:47.506 --> 02:15:49.007
LANGUAGE, AND I KNOW YOU'RE

02:15:49.074 --> 02:15:49.908
THINKING ABOUT THE QUESTION THAT

02:15:49.975 --> 02:15:51.743
I POSED, BUT I IMAGINE THAT

02:15:51.810 --> 02:15:53.578
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT YOUR OWN

02:15:53.645 --> 02:15:56.715
TRAUMA AND, YOU KNOW, I DON'T

02:15:56.781 --> 02:15:58.049
WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IT, BUT I

02:15:58.116 --> 02:15:59.551
THINK IT'S A PERFECT EXAMPLE TO

02:15:59.618 --> 02:16:00.886
HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. YOU SAID

02:16:00.952 --> 02:16:05.790
THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU WERE ABLE TO

02:16:05.857 --> 02:16:07.425
BREAK THE CYCLE WITH YOUR OWN

02:16:07.492 --> 02:16:10.395
CHILDREN. BUT I KNOW THAT

02:16:10.462 --> 02:16:11.763
BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT YOU DO,

02:16:11.830 --> 02:16:13.698
I IMAGINE THAT YOU HAVE

02:16:13.765 --> 02:16:15.100
RECURRING INCIDENCES ABOUT WHAT

02:16:15.166 --> 02:16:17.335
YOU EXPERIENCED. SURE. AND I

02:16:17.402 --> 02:16:19.337
AGREE, YOU REALLY CAN'T PUT A

02:16:19.404 --> 02:16:21.673
TIMELINE ON IT IF YOU THINK

02:16:21.740 --> 02:16:22.607
ABOUT THAT. LET'S THINK OF A

02:16:22.674 --> 02:16:24.609
CHILD OR AN ADULT WHO'S BEEN

02:16:24.676 --> 02:16:27.579
STRANGLED, FOR EXAMPLE, AND

02:16:27.646 --> 02:16:29.114
THEY'VE RECEIVED SOME TRAUMATIC

02:16:29.180 --> 02:16:31.883
BRAIN INJURY AS A RESULT OF THAT

02:16:31.950 --> 02:16:33.051
STRANGULATION. YOU KNOW, THE

02:16:33.118 --> 02:16:35.587
THOUGHT PROCESS IS DIFFERENT.

02:16:35.654 --> 02:16:37.422
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN YOU CAN SEE IT

02:16:37.489 --> 02:16:39.524
SO CLEARLY WHEN YOU SEE A

02:16:39.591 --> 02:16:42.460
CLIENT, IF YOU WILL, MEETING

02:16:42.527 --> 02:16:44.429
WITH THAT ADVOCATE, TELLING HIS

02:16:44.496 --> 02:16:47.566
OR HER STORY. MAYBE IT INCLUDES

02:16:47.632 --> 02:16:48.633
STRANGULATION, CHILD SEXUAL

02:16:48.700 --> 02:16:50.302
ABUSE, WHATEVER THE TRAUMA IT IS

02:16:50.368 --> 02:16:51.903
THAT THEY WENT THROUGH OR THE

02:16:51.970 --> 02:16:53.271
VICTIMIZATION, AND THEN THEY GO

02:16:53.338 --> 02:16:55.407
TO THE NEXT ROOM AND THEY MEET

02:16:55.473 --> 02:16:58.310
WITH THAT ATTORNEY. ATTORNEYS

02:16:58.376 --> 02:16:59.377
WANT FACTS BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:16:59.444 --> 02:17:01.413
TRYING TO PUT A CASE TOGETHER,

02:17:01.479 --> 02:17:03.281
RIGHT, FOR THE JUDGE TO GET

02:17:03.348 --> 02:17:04.716
THEIR RESTRAINING ORDER, IF YOU

02:17:04.783 --> 02:17:05.884
WILL. WELL, WE'VE TRAINED ALL

02:17:05.951 --> 02:17:09.087
OUR ATTORNEYS. YOU CAN'T DO THAT

02:17:09.154 --> 02:17:11.256
WITH SURVIVORS OF TRAUMA BECAUSE

02:17:11.323 --> 02:17:12.824
THEY DON'T THINK A LOT OF THEM

02:17:12.891 --> 02:17:15.293
DON'T THINK IN A LINEAR FASHION,

02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:17.462
FOR ONE THING. AND IF YOU HAVE A

02:17:17.529 --> 02:17:18.964
CHILD WHO'S BEEN THROUGH THE

02:17:19.030 --> 02:17:19.931
CHILD ADVOCACY CENTER, LIKE OUR

02:17:19.998 --> 02:17:21.333
SAFE CENTER, AND WE HAVE HIGH

02:17:21.399 --> 02:17:23.702
CASES EVERY SINGLE WEEK AND JUST

02:17:23.768 --> 02:17:25.604
OUR CENTER ALONE, WE SEE ABOUT

02:17:25.670 --> 02:17:28.940
40 TO 50 NEW CLIENTS EVERY WEEK

02:17:29.007 --> 02:17:30.709
OR MONTH, I SHOULD SAY. BUT A

02:17:30.775 --> 02:17:32.177
CHILD'S BEING INTERVIEWED AT THE

02:17:32.243 --> 02:17:34.279
AGE OF 13, OR LET'S JUST SAY THE

02:17:34.346 --> 02:17:37.482
AGE OF SIX. YOU KNOW, THE LITTLE

02:17:37.549 --> 02:17:39.384
GIRL SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT, FOR

02:17:39.451 --> 02:17:40.785
EXAMPLE, MAYBE THAT COURT CASE

02:17:40.852 --> 02:17:43.021
DOESN'T HAPPEN FOR 4 OR 5 YEARS

02:17:43.088 --> 02:17:45.490
NOW. THEY'RE ADULTS NOW. SO

02:17:45.557 --> 02:17:47.292
THEIR THOUGHT PROCESS, THEIR

02:17:47.359 --> 02:17:49.427
MEMORY IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT. SO

02:17:49.494 --> 02:17:52.564
WHAT WHAT IS THE HURRY, IF YOU

02:17:52.631 --> 02:17:55.867
WILL, TO PUT A STATUTE OF

02:17:55.934 --> 02:17:58.770
LIMITATION FOR SOME CASES, MAYBE

02:17:58.837 --> 02:18:00.639
FOR SOME SITUATIONS. BUT I THINK

02:18:00.705 --> 02:18:02.407
WHEN IT COMES TO DOMESTIC

02:18:02.474 --> 02:18:04.109
VIOLENCE OR SEXUAL ASSAULT,

02:18:04.175 --> 02:18:06.244
HUMAN TRAFFICKING, TAKE A HUMAN

02:18:06.311 --> 02:18:07.078
TRAFFICKING SURVIVOR. THAT'S A

02:18:07.145 --> 02:18:09.581
VERY DARK WORLD, VERY, VERY

02:18:09.648 --> 02:18:10.982
DARK. THEY DON'T EVEN BEGIN TO

02:18:11.049 --> 02:18:13.485
DEAL WITH THEIR TRAUMA AT THE

02:18:13.551 --> 02:18:15.020
VERY BEGINNING. IT'S SOMETIMES

02:18:15.086 --> 02:18:16.888
YEARS LATER AND YOU HAVE TO

02:18:16.955 --> 02:18:17.789
FOLLOW ALONG WITH THEM FOR A

02:18:17.856 --> 02:18:21.893
LONG, LONG TIME, YOU KNOW? SO I

02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:23.595
DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER ON WHAT IS

02:18:23.662 --> 02:18:26.097
THE TIME FRAME FOR STATUTE OF

02:18:26.164 --> 02:18:27.666
LIMITATION. YES. AND I KNOW

02:18:27.732 --> 02:18:29.701
ASSEMBLYMEMBER RODRIGUEZ, THANK

02:18:29.768 --> 02:18:31.603
YOU. I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU

02:18:31.670 --> 02:18:32.437
GUYS FOR BEING HERE. NOW THAT

02:18:32.504 --> 02:18:33.738
YOU HIT ON HUMAN TRAFFICKING,

02:18:33.805 --> 02:18:36.041
THAT'S A BIG DEAL. IN MY

02:18:36.107 --> 02:18:36.675
DISTRICT. I REPRESENT THE CITY

02:18:36.741 --> 02:18:39.277
OF POMONA. I KNOW LAST WEEK I

02:18:39.344 --> 02:18:40.478
JUST READ. WE JUST. GOT A VICTIM

02:18:40.545 --> 02:18:42.981
OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. THEY GOT

02:18:43.048 --> 02:18:44.683
RESCUED HER. SO, YOU KNOW, WITH

02:18:44.749 --> 02:18:47.318
THAT BEING SAID, I WAS A YOUNG

02:18:47.385 --> 02:18:49.587
MOM, AND I, MY DAUGHTER'S

02:18:49.654 --> 02:18:50.588
FATHER, HE WASN'T. I WOULDN'T

02:18:50.655 --> 02:18:52.657
SAY HE NEVER HIT ME OR ANYTHING,

02:18:52.724 --> 02:18:54.993
BUT HE WAS VERY JEALOUS. BUT I

02:18:55.060 --> 02:18:56.428
NOTICED I NOTICED I, I KNOW HE

02:18:56.494 --> 02:18:57.595
WAS LIKE THAT EARLY ON AND I

02:18:57.662 --> 02:18:59.698
KNEW THAT WASN'T GOING TO BE FOR

02:18:59.764 --> 02:19:01.499
ME. THAT'S NOT HOW I WANTED TO

02:19:01.566 --> 02:19:02.701
RAISE MY DAUGHTER. SEEING SOME

02:19:02.767 --> 02:19:04.302
HER DAD ACTING LIKE THIS, HE

02:19:04.369 --> 02:19:04.836
DID. UNFORTUNATELY, HE GOT

02:19:04.903 --> 02:19:06.571
KILLED IN A DRIVE BY SHOOTING.

02:19:06.638 --> 02:19:08.707
AND, YOU KNOW, THAT NEVER WAS AN

02:19:08.773 --> 02:19:09.674
ISSUE. BUT I DID IDENTIFY THAT

02:19:09.741 --> 02:19:11.876
AS A YOUNG CHILD. AS A YOUNG

02:19:11.943 --> 02:19:13.611
GIRL, I WAS 16 YEARS OLD, THAT

02:19:13.678 --> 02:19:14.846
THIS MAN COULD HAVE BEEN

02:19:14.913 --> 02:19:15.814
ABUSIVE. RIGHT. SO ANYWAYS, WITH

02:19:15.880 --> 02:19:17.615
THAT, I WANT TO THANK YOU GUYS

02:19:17.682 --> 02:19:19.484
FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND I

02:19:19.551 --> 02:19:20.685
APPRECIATE IT. YOU KNOW, EVERY

02:19:20.752 --> 02:19:22.353
ONE OF YOU HAVE THANKED US FOR

02:19:22.420 --> 02:19:23.722
BEING HERE TODAY, BUT EVERY ONE

02:19:23.788 --> 02:19:25.757
OF YOU HAVE SHARED A PART OF

02:19:25.824 --> 02:19:27.525
YOUR STORY WITH US TOO. SO WE

02:19:27.592 --> 02:19:28.526
THANK YOU FOR THAT. I THINK ONE

02:19:28.593 --> 02:19:30.929
OF THE GREATEST GIFTS YOU CAN

02:19:30.995 --> 02:19:31.529
GIVE SOMEONE IS SHARING YOUR

02:19:31.596 --> 02:19:33.565
STORY, BUT WHAT'S EVEN GREATER

02:19:33.631 --> 02:19:34.566
IS HAVING SOMEONE TO LISTEN TO

02:19:34.632 --> 02:19:36.468
YOUR STORY. YOU KNOW, AND I KNOW

02:19:36.534 --> 02:19:38.303
WHEN YOU COME TO ALL OF OUR

02:19:38.369 --> 02:19:39.738
CENTERS, THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE

02:19:39.804 --> 02:19:40.905
GOING TO GET. YOU'RE GOING TO

02:19:40.972 --> 02:19:41.873
GET TWO PEOPLE WHO REALLY,

02:19:41.940 --> 02:19:43.308
REALLY LISTEN TO YOUR STORY AND

02:19:43.375 --> 02:19:44.776
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE IN

02:19:44.843 --> 02:19:46.244
LAW ENFORCEMENT, BECAUSE YOU

02:19:46.311 --> 02:19:47.846
GUYS GET A CRAPPY DEAL, YOU

02:19:47.912 --> 02:19:48.646
KNOW? BUT CENTERS LIKE US REALLY

02:19:48.713 --> 02:19:50.315
SUPPORT THE OFFICERS, LAW

02:19:50.381 --> 02:19:50.915
ENFORCEMENT AND PARTICULARLY

02:19:50.982 --> 02:19:51.816
YOUR SAFETY. THANK YOU. AND THEN

02:19:51.883 --> 02:19:56.454
JENNICA AND. TAYLOR AS WELL, I

02:19:56.521 --> 02:19:58.256
YOU KNOW, YOU WORK WITH TEENS

02:19:58.323 --> 02:20:01.826
AND THE I DON'T EVEN KNOW THE

02:20:01.893 --> 02:20:04.028
REAL QUESTION BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:20:04.095 --> 02:20:06.264
JUST FINDING OUT THAT THEY ARE

02:20:06.331 --> 02:20:08.099
IN A RELATIONSHIP THAT'S ABUSIVE

02:20:08.166 --> 02:20:11.169
OR THAT THEY'RE BEING COERCED

02:20:11.236 --> 02:20:15.940
OR. WHAT IS. I THINK THE

02:20:16.007 --> 02:20:17.709
QUESTION IS WHEN THEY REALIZE

02:20:17.776 --> 02:20:21.679
THAT THIS IS HAPPENING. HAVE YOU

02:20:21.746 --> 02:20:25.049
SEEN ACTUALLY FOLKS LOOKING FOR

02:20:25.116 --> 02:20:26.818
HELP OR SOME OF THEM ARE JUST

02:20:26.885 --> 02:20:27.485
RESIGNING THEMSELVES THAT THAT'S

02:20:27.552 --> 02:20:29.654
JUST THE WAY IT IS. I HATE TO

02:20:29.721 --> 02:20:31.523
ASK IT THAT WAY, BUT I KNOW

02:20:31.589 --> 02:20:33.458
THAT, YOU KNOW, THE CONVERSATION

02:20:33.525 --> 02:20:35.026
ABOUT WHY DON'T THEY LEAVE,

02:20:35.093 --> 02:20:36.461
RIGHT? WELL, IF YOU DON'T KNOW

02:20:36.528 --> 02:20:38.263
THAT IT'S HAPPENING TO YOU, YOU

02:20:38.329 --> 02:20:40.465
HAVE NO IDEA THAT THERE IS

02:20:40.532 --> 02:20:41.633
ANOTHER OPTION. AND SO IF YOU

02:20:41.699 --> 02:20:43.368
CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

02:20:43.434 --> 02:20:44.502
THAT, WE HAVE ABOUT TEN MORE

02:20:44.569 --> 02:20:46.771
MINUTES. SO AND THEN WE'LL WRAP

02:20:46.838 --> 02:20:48.072
IT UP. THANK YOU. I'LL SHARE

02:20:48.139 --> 02:20:49.874
WITH SOME OF THE TEENS THAT I

02:20:49.941 --> 02:20:50.842
WORK WITH. SOMETIMES THEY'RE

02:20:50.909 --> 02:20:52.644
MORE AFRAID TO TELL BECAUSE

02:20:52.710 --> 02:20:53.278
THEY'RE AFRAID THEY'RE GOING TO

02:20:53.344 --> 02:20:55.613
GET IN TROUBLE WITH THEIR

02:20:55.680 --> 02:20:57.415
PARENTS, BECAUSE MAYBE THEY'RE

02:20:57.482 --> 02:20:58.817
NOT SUPPOSED TO BE DATING, OR

02:20:58.883 --> 02:21:00.652
MAYBE THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE

02:21:00.718 --> 02:21:02.787
WHERE THEY SAID THEY WERE AT OR,

02:21:02.854 --> 02:21:04.589
YOU KNOW, SO SOMETIMES THOSE

02:21:04.656 --> 02:21:06.391
FEARS OF JUST, I'M GOING TO BE

02:21:06.457 --> 02:21:07.458
GROUNDED, I'M GOING TO BE IN

02:21:07.525 --> 02:21:09.861
TROUBLE. I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE

02:21:09.928 --> 02:21:11.062
MY PHONE RIGHT. IS THE BIGGEST

02:21:11.129 --> 02:21:12.797
THING FOR THEM TO JUST STAY

02:21:12.864 --> 02:21:15.400
SILENT. AND IT TAKES I THINK,

02:21:15.466 --> 02:21:17.268
YOU KNOW, JUST THAT COMFORT AND

02:21:17.335 --> 02:21:19.003
SAFE SPACE OF JUST, HEY, IT'S

02:21:19.070 --> 02:21:20.371
GOING TO BE OKAY AND YOUR

02:21:20.438 --> 02:21:21.773
PARENTS WOULD RATHER KNOW THIS

02:21:21.840 --> 02:21:24.042
THAN TO FIND OUT THAT YOU WERE

02:21:24.108 --> 02:21:25.810
KILLED. AND I THINK WHEN

02:21:25.877 --> 02:21:26.845
SOMETIMES WE PUT IT IN THAT

02:21:26.911 --> 02:21:28.646
PERSPECTIVE AND WE GIVE THOSE

02:21:28.713 --> 02:21:29.447
REAL LIFE EXAMPLES, LOOK AT WHAT

02:21:29.514 --> 02:21:30.715
JUST HAPPENED IN AZUSA. THIS

02:21:30.782 --> 02:21:33.218
LITTLE GIRL SHOULD HAVE

02:21:33.284 --> 02:21:33.852
GRADUATED LAST MONTH. THEY'RE

02:21:33.918 --> 02:21:34.853
LIKE, WOW, I SAID, THIS IS REAL.

02:21:34.919 --> 02:21:36.955
THIS REALLY HAPPENS. AND WHEN

02:21:37.021 --> 02:21:38.022
SOMEBODY LEAVES, YOU'RE YOU'RE

02:21:38.089 --> 02:21:39.858
MORE AT RISK. AND ALL OF THE,

02:21:39.924 --> 02:21:40.859
YOU KNOW, TOOLS THAT YOU GUYS

02:21:40.925 --> 02:21:42.927
ALL MENTIONED. BUT I THINK, YOU

02:21:42.994 --> 02:21:45.196
KNOW, KIND OF JUST WHAT SUSIE

02:21:45.263 --> 02:21:45.964
SAID SOMETIMES WHEN YOU'RE

02:21:46.030 --> 02:21:47.232
DEALING WITH SOMEBODY AND

02:21:47.298 --> 02:21:48.433
TALKING ABOUT THAT STATUE, WHEN

02:21:48.500 --> 02:21:50.301
WE TALK WITH THE TEENS, I'LL,

02:21:50.368 --> 02:21:53.137
I'LL TELL THEM, IF YOU'RE YOU

02:21:53.204 --> 02:21:54.339
SHARING THIS OR YOU TALKING

02:21:54.405 --> 02:21:55.640
ABOUT IT, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT

02:21:55.707 --> 02:21:56.975
SOMEONE ELSE IS GOING THROUGH.

02:21:57.041 --> 02:21:58.776
AND THAT MAY BE ALL THAT THAT

02:21:58.843 --> 02:22:00.745
PERSON MAY NEED TO SHARE THAT

02:22:00.812 --> 02:22:02.480
THIS HAPPENED TO THEM FIVE YEARS

02:22:02.547 --> 02:22:03.882
AGO OR THIS HAPPENED TO THEM

02:22:03.948 --> 02:22:05.316
LAST WEEK. YOU NEVER KNOW AND

02:22:05.383 --> 02:22:07.619
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU COMING

02:22:07.685 --> 02:22:08.920
FORWARD. ARE YOU SHOWING THAT,

02:22:08.987 --> 02:22:10.755
HEY, THIS ISN'T OKAY MIGHT DO

02:22:10.822 --> 02:22:12.624
FOR SOMEBODY ELSE. AND THAT CAN

02:22:12.690 --> 02:22:13.758
MAKE THE BIGGEST IMPACT AMONGST

02:22:13.825 --> 02:22:15.560
THEIR PEERS IS TO SEE SOMEBODY

02:22:15.627 --> 02:22:17.662
ELSE THAT THEY KNOW AND THAT

02:22:17.729 --> 02:22:18.696
THEY TRUST IN THEIR GROUP. BE

02:22:18.763 --> 02:22:20.398
ABLE TO SAY, HEY, THIS ISN'T

02:22:20.465 --> 02:22:22.300
OKAY. AND THAT FOR THEM IS

02:22:22.367 --> 02:22:23.601
BIGGER SOMETIMES THAN US COMING

02:22:23.668 --> 02:22:24.969
IN AND JUST SAYING THIS, IT'S

02:22:25.036 --> 02:22:26.371
SEEING THAT THEIR THEIR PEERS.

02:22:26.437 --> 02:22:27.939
AND THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO

02:22:28.006 --> 02:22:29.207
PROVIDE THAT EDUCATION TO

02:22:29.274 --> 02:22:30.541
EVERYONE, BECAUSE IT MIGHT TAKE

02:22:30.608 --> 02:22:31.476
SOMEBODY ELSE WHO ISN'T WEARING

02:22:31.542 --> 02:22:32.944
THOSE LITTLE BLINDERS SUNGLASSES

02:22:33.011 --> 02:22:35.680
TO SAY, HEY, THIS IS NOT OKAY.

02:22:35.747 --> 02:22:38.249
WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT

02:22:38.316 --> 02:22:39.617
THIS. THANK YOU. TAYLOR, STAY ON

02:22:39.684 --> 02:22:41.719
THE SUBJECT OF THOSE ROSE

02:22:41.786 --> 02:22:44.122
COLORED GLASSES. I THINK A LOT

02:22:44.188 --> 02:22:44.889
WITH TEENAGERS. WE ALWAYS WANT

02:22:44.956 --> 02:22:46.724
TO NAME THE BEHAVIOR. I DON'T

02:22:46.791 --> 02:22:49.093
WANT YOU AS AN ADULT OR A PERSON

02:22:49.160 --> 02:22:50.261
IN YOUR LIFE TO CRITICIZE THE

02:22:50.328 --> 02:22:51.596
PERSON BECAUSE THEY LOVE THAT

02:22:51.663 --> 02:22:52.964
PERSON, RIGHT? SO IN NAMING, IF

02:22:53.031 --> 02:22:55.133
WE CALL THEM RED, YELLOW AND

02:22:55.199 --> 02:22:56.301
GREEN FLAGS, IF WE CALL THEM

02:22:56.367 --> 02:22:59.037
LIKE WARNING SIGNS, NAMING THOSE

02:22:59.103 --> 02:23:01.673
BEHAVIORS AND ENCOURAGING THEM

02:23:01.739 --> 02:23:03.274
TO BRING THAT INTO THEIR FRIEND

02:23:03.341 --> 02:23:05.109
GROUP, RIGHT, ALERTING TEACHERS

02:23:05.176 --> 02:23:06.878
WHERE THEY CAN FIND US. BECAUSE

02:23:06.945 --> 02:23:08.346
SOMETIMES PEOPLE TELL A TEACHER

02:23:08.413 --> 02:23:09.981
AND THE TEACHER DOES NOT KNOW

02:23:10.048 --> 02:23:11.649
WHERE TO GET HELP, RIGHT? THE

02:23:11.716 --> 02:23:12.984
PRINCIPAL JUGGLES A THOUSAND

02:23:13.051 --> 02:23:14.419
HATS AND DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THE

02:23:14.485 --> 02:23:15.954
NAME OF THE STATUTE IS. I CAN

02:23:16.020 --> 02:23:17.355
TIE THAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT INTO

02:23:17.422 --> 02:23:18.790
YOUR SCHOOL'S ANTI-BULLYING

02:23:18.856 --> 02:23:19.891
POLICY. THEY DON'T KNOW BECAUSE

02:23:19.958 --> 02:23:21.926
THEY HAVEN'T DONE IT BEFORE. I

02:23:21.993 --> 02:23:23.561
ALSO WANT TO NOD THAT A LOT OF

02:23:23.628 --> 02:23:25.129
THE HIGH SCHOOLERS AND COLLEGE

02:23:25.196 --> 02:23:27.098
STUDENTS I WORK WITH ARE KIND OF

02:23:27.165 --> 02:23:28.766
HOPING THEY DON'T HAVE TO END

02:23:28.833 --> 02:23:29.934
THE RELATIONSHIP. THEY'RE HOPING

02:23:30.001 --> 02:23:31.369
IT'S NATURALLY GOING TO END WHEN

02:23:31.436 --> 02:23:32.804
SUMMER BREAK STARTS. THEY'RE

02:23:32.870 --> 02:23:34.405
HOPING IT'S NATURALLY GOING TO

02:23:34.472 --> 02:23:36.507
END WHEN THEY LEAVE FOR COLLEGE.

02:23:36.574 --> 02:23:38.309
SO I THINK ALSO EMPOWERING OUR

02:23:38.376 --> 02:23:39.911
YOUTH WITH SKILLS ABOUT THAT

02:23:39.978 --> 02:23:42.013
SOME RELATIONSHIPS END AND WHY

02:23:42.080 --> 02:23:43.982
THEY END AND HOW TO END THEM

02:23:44.048 --> 02:23:44.582
RESPECTFULLY SO THAT THEY CAN

02:23:44.649 --> 02:23:47.318
NOT ONLY KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT FOR

02:23:47.385 --> 02:23:49.887
THEMSELVES, BUT ALSO KNOW HOW TO

02:23:49.954 --> 02:23:51.189
ENCOURAGE THAT OR REINFORCE THAT

02:23:51.255 --> 02:23:52.890
POSITIVE BEHAVIOR IN FRIENDS.

02:23:52.957 --> 02:23:55.226
BECAUSE I THINK THEY REALLY DO

02:23:55.293 --> 02:23:56.627
CHECK EACH OTHER, RIGHT? AND

02:23:56.694 --> 02:23:57.762
EMPOWERING THEM THAT THAT IS

02:23:57.829 --> 02:23:59.597
LOVE. IF YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT

02:23:59.664 --> 02:24:00.465
SOMEBODY, YOU WILL CALL THEM

02:24:00.531 --> 02:24:01.866
OUT. YOU WILL SAY, HEY, I

02:24:01.933 --> 02:24:04.702
NOTICED YOU SPEND TOO MUCH TIME

02:24:04.769 --> 02:24:05.737
SCROLLING ON YOUR EX'S PAGE AND

02:24:05.803 --> 02:24:07.338
WE'RE GOING TO GO DO SOMETHING

02:24:07.405 --> 02:24:08.806
ELSE. NOW, I ALSO WANT TO NOD ON

02:24:08.873 --> 02:24:10.441
THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS THAT

02:24:10.508 --> 02:24:11.809
WE GOT TEXT MESSAGES. I GOT

02:24:11.876 --> 02:24:14.879
PHONE CALLS ABOUT JUST SORT OF,

02:24:14.946 --> 02:24:17.248
I THINK THE INCREDULITY THAT A

02:24:17.315 --> 02:24:19.050
VIDEO COULD EXIST OF SOMEONE

02:24:19.117 --> 02:24:20.485
BEING BEAT IN A PUBLIC SPACE IN

02:24:20.551 --> 02:24:22.520
A HOTEL AND THAT THERE WAS AN

02:24:22.587 --> 02:24:23.855
EXPIRATION OF A STATUTE OF

02:24:23.921 --> 02:24:25.456
LIMITATIONS. SO I THINK THE

02:24:25.523 --> 02:24:26.824
OTHER THING IS CONSIDERING, IF

02:24:26.891 --> 02:24:29.293
NOTHING ELSE, IF THERE ARE

02:24:29.360 --> 02:24:30.528
CERTAIN KINDS OF EVIDENCE, IS

02:24:30.595 --> 02:24:32.797
THERE A WAY WE CAN EXTEND THE

02:24:32.864 --> 02:24:33.765
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR THAT,

02:24:33.831 --> 02:24:35.466
IF NOTHING ELSE? BECAUSE I THINK

02:24:35.533 --> 02:24:37.635
AND I KNOW THAT HUNDREDS OF

02:24:37.702 --> 02:24:39.103
THOUSANDS OF KIDS SAW THAT

02:24:39.170 --> 02:24:40.838
VIDEO, AND THEN THEY LEARNED

02:24:40.905 --> 02:24:42.540
THAT IF YOU PAY ENOUGH, IT COULD

02:24:42.607 --> 02:24:44.909
GO AWAY AND THAT EVENTUALLY IT

02:24:44.976 --> 02:24:46.577
COULD BE EXPIRED AS EVIDENCE. SO

02:24:46.644 --> 02:24:48.813
I THINK THAT INCREDULITY, LIVING

02:24:48.880 --> 02:24:50.014
ONLINE AND KNOWING THAT A VIDEO

02:24:50.081 --> 02:24:51.649
OR AUDIO IS PROOF, AND THEN THE

02:24:51.716 --> 02:24:53.184
IDEA THAT THAT COULDN'T BE

02:24:53.251 --> 02:24:55.987
SUBMITTED LATER WAS REALLY MIND

02:24:56.054 --> 02:24:57.655
BLOWING. I KNOW TO THEM AND

02:24:57.722 --> 02:25:00.258
SHOULD BE A WAKE UP CALL FOR THE

02:25:00.324 --> 02:25:01.392
REST OF US. THANK YOU. THANK YOU

02:25:01.459 --> 02:25:02.827
VERY MUCH. I REALLY APPRECIATE

02:25:02.894 --> 02:25:05.263
THE CONVERSATION. AND IT'S HARD,

02:25:05.329 --> 02:25:06.798
HEART WRENCHING. AND, YOU KNOW,

02:25:06.864 --> 02:25:08.232
QUITE FRANKLY, SOME OF THE

02:25:08.299 --> 02:25:11.803
STORIES THAT THAT THAT YOU HAVE

02:25:11.869 --> 02:25:16.107
REALLY. MAKE US THINK TWICE

02:25:16.174 --> 02:25:18.342
ABOUT WHAT WHAT WE PRETEND IS

02:25:18.409 --> 02:25:19.811
REALLY WHAT'S NOT HAPPENING. AND

02:25:19.877 --> 02:25:21.646
I THINK THAT'S THE, YOU KNOW, TO

02:25:21.712 --> 02:25:23.514
YOUR ALL, I THINK ALL OF YOU

02:25:23.581 --> 02:25:24.816
MADE THE POINT ABOUT HAVING

02:25:24.882 --> 02:25:26.350
THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH TEENS

02:25:26.417 --> 02:25:27.351
AND QUITE FRANKLY, ADULTS. I

02:25:27.418 --> 02:25:29.353
DON'T THINK SOME OF US ADULTS

02:25:29.420 --> 02:25:30.988
ARE ALSO PREPARED TO END

02:25:31.055 --> 02:25:32.723
RELATIONSHIPS OR TO ASSEMBLY

02:25:32.790 --> 02:25:34.325
MEMBER LISA'S POINT. YOU KNOW,

02:25:34.392 --> 02:25:36.994
THEY'RE THE BREADWINNERS OF THE

02:25:37.061 --> 02:25:38.496
HOUSEHOLD. SO HOW DO YOU

02:25:38.563 --> 02:25:40.298
NAVIGATE THAT? BUT IT'S

02:25:40.364 --> 02:25:42.233
IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THESE

02:25:42.300 --> 02:25:44.936
CONVERSATIONS AND, YOU KNOW, THE

02:25:45.002 --> 02:25:47.672
GOAL ALWAYS IS AT LEAST ONE

02:25:47.738 --> 02:25:49.407
OUTCOME FROM FROM THIS BECAUSE I

02:25:49.474 --> 02:25:52.944
MY FAMOUS I WAS ON WHAT IS IT

02:25:53.010 --> 02:25:56.514
THEY HAVE LIKE A MEME WEBSITE

02:25:56.581 --> 02:26:00.885
GIFT CAUCUS AND I THEY CATCH

02:26:00.952 --> 02:26:02.019
LEGISLATORS SAYING THINGS

02:26:02.086 --> 02:26:03.354
SOMETIMES. AND YOU KNOW, THE ONE

02:26:03.421 --> 02:26:05.690
THAT I WAS CAUGHT ON IS I SAID,

02:26:05.756 --> 02:26:07.291
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE A MEETING

02:26:07.358 --> 02:26:08.726
JUST TO HAVE ANOTHER MEETING,

02:26:08.793 --> 02:26:10.628
WHICH IS THE REALITY OF WHAT WE

02:26:10.695 --> 02:26:11.963
DO HERE. WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE

02:26:12.029 --> 02:26:13.397
MEETINGS JUST TO HAVE MEETINGS

02:26:13.464 --> 02:26:15.566
AND PRETEND THAT, YOU KNOW, LOOK

02:26:15.633 --> 02:26:16.501
AT ALL OF THAT WE WERE DOING

02:26:16.567 --> 02:26:18.002
BECAUSE NOW WE'RE POSTING OR

02:26:18.069 --> 02:26:19.837
WHATEVER IT IS I WANT, YOU KNOW,

02:26:19.904 --> 02:26:21.806
AT LEAST ONE OUTCOME, A TANGIBLE

02:26:21.873 --> 02:26:23.274
OUTCOME AS SMALL AS IT CAN, IT

02:26:23.341 --> 02:26:24.909
CAN BE, AT LEAST FOR US TO DO

02:26:24.976 --> 02:26:26.444
SOMETHING. BECAUSE IF WE KEEP

02:26:26.511 --> 02:26:28.212
PRETENDING THAT THINGS ARE FINE,

02:26:28.279 --> 02:26:29.647
JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE THE

02:26:29.714 --> 02:26:30.481
CONVERSATION IS LIKE, OH, LOOK

02:26:30.548 --> 02:26:33.017
AT WHAT WE DID. WE HAVEN'T

02:26:33.084 --> 02:26:34.519
REALLY DONE ANYTHING THAT'S

02:26:34.585 --> 02:26:35.119
TANGIBLE. AND SO, YOU KNOW, I

02:26:35.186 --> 02:26:38.422
THINK NOT FOR NOW. THINK ABOUT

02:26:38.489 --> 02:26:40.158
ONE. EVEN AT THE SMALLEST THING.

02:26:40.224 --> 02:26:41.859
YOU KNOW, I HEARD FROM TAYLOR

02:26:41.926 --> 02:26:44.028
ABOUT THE, THE, THE YOUTH ACT.

02:26:44.095 --> 02:26:45.463
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT TOOL THAT IS

02:26:45.530 --> 02:26:47.598
NOT BEING USED. BUT WHAT OTHER

02:26:47.665 --> 02:26:50.034
REALLY SMALL THE BIG THINGS

02:26:50.101 --> 02:26:51.636
OBVIOUSLY WOULD BE GREAT. BUT IN

02:26:51.702 --> 02:26:54.105
THIS CLIMATE THOSE ARE NOT

02:26:54.172 --> 02:26:56.641
POSSIBLE. AND I HATE TO BE SO

02:26:56.707 --> 02:26:58.509
BLUNT ABOUT IT, BUT THAT'S OUR

02:26:58.576 --> 02:27:00.111
REALITY. BUT WHAT IS ONE, YOU

02:27:00.178 --> 02:27:02.013
KNOW, LITTLE THING THAT WE CAN

02:27:02.079 --> 02:27:04.582
DO TO BE ABLE TO HELP? AND, YOU

02:27:04.649 --> 02:27:06.150
KNOW, AGAIN, NOT RIGHT NOW. JUST

02:27:06.217 --> 02:27:07.451
THINK ABOUT IT AND SEND US

02:27:07.518 --> 02:27:09.320
SOMETHING, BECAUSE I KNOW THAT

02:27:09.387 --> 02:27:11.322
THE FOLKS THAT ARE HERE AND EVEN

02:27:11.389 --> 02:27:12.723
THE FOLKS THAT ARE NOT HERE, THE

02:27:12.790 --> 02:27:14.392
RESPONSE THAT I GET FROM OUR

02:27:14.458 --> 02:27:15.793
COLLEAGUES WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

02:27:15.860 --> 02:27:16.727
ISSUES LIKE THIS, ESPECIALLY

02:27:16.794 --> 02:27:18.596
WHEN IT INVOLVES CHILDREN AND

02:27:18.663 --> 02:27:20.031
TEENS, BECAUSE WE'RE ALL, YOU

02:27:20.097 --> 02:27:22.233
KNOW, WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE. WE

02:27:22.300 --> 02:27:23.000
ALL KNOW HOW DIFFICULT OUR TEEN

02:27:23.067 --> 02:27:24.468
YEARS WERE. AND, YOU KNOW, THE

02:27:24.535 --> 02:27:26.404
THINGS THAT THANK GOD THERE WAS

02:27:26.470 --> 02:27:28.706
NO SOCIAL MEDIA WHEN I WAS A

02:27:28.773 --> 02:27:30.341
KID. BUT I KNOW THAT THE BIGGEST

02:27:30.408 --> 02:27:31.576
INFLUENCER IN OUR KIDS LIVES

02:27:31.642 --> 02:27:33.211
RIGHT NOW IS SOCIAL MEDIA. AND

02:27:33.277 --> 02:27:35.446
SO, SO SOMETHING FOR THE KIDS,

02:27:35.513 --> 02:27:37.181
BUT ALSO SOMETHING FOR THE

02:27:37.248 --> 02:27:38.749
ADULTS, THE PARENTS, THE

02:27:38.816 --> 02:27:40.851
TEACHERS. I WAS A TEACHER, AND I

02:27:40.918 --> 02:27:42.653
WAS NOT BY ANY MEANS EQUIPPED TO

02:27:42.720 --> 02:27:44.488
DO WHAT YOU DO. BUT WE ARE

02:27:44.555 --> 02:27:46.624
MANDATED REPORTERS AND SO, SO AT

02:27:46.691 --> 02:27:48.392
MINIMUM, HOW DO WE NAVIGATE

02:27:48.459 --> 02:27:51.395
THAT? SO WITH THAT, ANY CLOSING

02:27:51.462 --> 02:27:53.931
REMARKS? ASSEMBLY MEMBER NO

02:27:53.998 --> 02:27:55.600
THANK YOU. HE'S GOOD. THANK YOU.

02:27:55.666 --> 02:27:57.368
JUST AGAIN, I WANT TO THANK ALL

02:27:57.435 --> 02:27:59.704
OF YOU FOR BEING HERE. AND IF

02:27:59.770 --> 02:28:00.771
YOU CAN SEND ME THE ONE THING

02:28:00.838 --> 02:28:03.541
THAT YOU THINK WE COULD DO, AND

02:28:03.608 --> 02:28:05.610
I LIKE THE IDEA OF, OF THE, THE

02:28:05.676 --> 02:28:08.145
AMBASSADORS, I THINK I SAW

02:28:08.212 --> 02:28:09.714
SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THAT ABOUT

02:28:09.780 --> 02:28:11.849
4 OR 5 YEARS AGO. A GROUP CAME

02:28:11.916 --> 02:28:13.584
INTO MY OFFICE THAT THEY, THEY,

02:28:13.651 --> 02:28:15.553
THEY HAVE LITTLE POCKETS WITHIN

02:28:15.620 --> 02:28:16.988
THEIR HIGH SCHOOL AND THAT WERE

02:28:17.054 --> 02:28:18.623
THERE THE MENTORS OR THEY'RE THE

02:28:18.689 --> 02:28:20.558
ONES THAT ARE TALKING TO THE

02:28:20.625 --> 02:28:22.727
KIDS BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW I CAN

02:28:22.793 --> 02:28:24.395
TELL MY KIDS EXACTLY THE SAME

02:28:24.462 --> 02:28:25.696
THING THAT A TEEN TELLS THEM,

02:28:25.763 --> 02:28:27.398
AND THEY'LL BE LIKE, YOU DON'T

02:28:27.465 --> 02:28:28.766
KNOW ANYTHING. AND THEN THEY

02:28:28.833 --> 02:28:30.568
THE, THE, THE PEER SAYS IT AND

02:28:30.635 --> 02:28:32.670
IT'S LIKE ALL OF A SUDDEN IT'S

02:28:32.737 --> 02:28:34.305
MAGIC. AND I WAS LIKE, IT WAS

02:28:34.372 --> 02:28:35.506
EXACTLY THE SAME THING I TOLD

02:28:35.573 --> 02:28:39.477
YOU, BUT YOU KNOW. IMPLEMENTING

02:28:39.543 --> 02:28:40.711
SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS OR SOME

02:28:40.778 --> 02:28:41.946
OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS OR MAYBE

02:28:42.013 --> 02:28:44.615
A CLUB OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN

02:28:44.682 --> 02:28:45.483
THE, IN THE SCHOOLS MIGHT HELP

02:28:45.549 --> 02:28:47.218
US. BUT THE ALWAYS THE QUESTION

02:28:47.285 --> 02:28:49.654
IS WE HAVE A SERVICES FOR THE

02:28:49.720 --> 02:28:52.123
VICTIMS. BUT UNTIL WE SERVICE

02:28:52.189 --> 02:28:54.025
THE ABUSERS WE'RE NEVER GOING TO

02:28:54.091 --> 02:28:56.460
GET OUT OF THIS SITUATION. AND

02:28:56.527 --> 02:28:57.928
AS I SAY THIS TIME AND TIME

02:28:57.995 --> 02:29:00.431
AGAIN, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, MY

02:29:00.498 --> 02:29:02.700
FAMILY HAS EXPERIENCED DOMESTIC

02:29:02.767 --> 02:29:05.870
VIOLENCE, MY SISTER JUST GOT

02:29:05.936 --> 02:29:07.171
ANOTHER RESTRAINING ORDER. SO

02:29:07.238 --> 02:29:08.673
THE FIRST RESTRAINING ORDER WAS

02:29:08.739 --> 02:29:09.874
FOR THREE YEARS. THE SECOND ONE

02:29:09.940 --> 02:29:11.942
WAS FOR FIVE YEARS, AND NOW A

02:29:12.009 --> 02:29:13.844
THIRD RESTRAINING ORDER FOR AN

02:29:13.911 --> 02:29:14.679
ADDITIONAL SIX YEARS TO END. THE

02:29:14.745 --> 02:29:16.614
ABUSER CLAIMS HE DIDN'T DO

02:29:16.681 --> 02:29:17.515
ANYTHING. IT'S LIKE, OKAY, IT'S

02:29:17.581 --> 02:29:19.884
GOING TO BE 14 YEARS, BUT IT'S A

02:29:19.950 --> 02:29:20.518
PIECE OF PAPER. AND UNTIL HE

02:29:20.584 --> 02:29:23.454
GETS HELP AND ALL THE HE'S OR

02:29:23.521 --> 02:29:25.589
SHE'S THAT ABUSE, GET THAT HELP,

02:29:25.656 --> 02:29:27.224
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE ON THIS

02:29:27.291 --> 02:29:28.793
PATH OF YET ANOTHER RESTRAINING

02:29:28.859 --> 02:29:31.128
ORDER AND YET ANOTHER, YOU KNOW,

02:29:31.195 --> 02:29:33.197
MORE MONEY THAT WE NEED FOR OUR

02:29:33.264 --> 02:29:33.831
VICTIMS ADVOCATES. YOU KNOW, I

02:29:33.898 --> 02:29:35.966
WANT TO GET TO A POINT WHERE,

02:29:36.033 --> 02:29:37.735
YOU KNOW, I KNOW I'M DREAMING,

02:29:37.802 --> 02:29:38.803
BUT TO THE POINT WHERE WE'RE

02:29:38.869 --> 02:29:40.738
LIKE, YOU KNOW, WE DON'T NEED

02:29:40.805 --> 02:29:41.772
THAT ANYMORE BECAUSE OUR TEENS

02:29:41.839 --> 02:29:43.341
ARE GROWING UP HEALTHY NOW. THEY

02:29:43.407 --> 02:29:44.442
KNOW AND THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT

02:29:44.508 --> 02:29:45.710
HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS ARE.

02:29:45.776 --> 02:29:47.945
ADULTS UNDERSTAND HOW TO, AT

02:29:48.012 --> 02:29:49.947
MINIMUM, GUIDE THEM IN THE RIGHT

02:29:50.014 --> 02:29:51.882
DIRECTION. BUT WITH THAT, WE'LL

02:29:51.949 --> 02:29:53.718
END. I KNOW AGAIN, I REALLY,

02:29:53.784 --> 02:29:54.852

TO OUR KIDS IS SO IMPORTANT

02:30:05.663 --> 02:30:08.432
BECAUSE IF WE CAN'T CHANGE THE

02:30:08.499 --> 02:30:11.068
LIVES OF THE ABUSERS AS ADULTS,

02:30:11.135 --> 02:30:12.703
IF WE CAN START AT LEAST

02:30:12.770 --> 02:30:14.238
CHANGING THOSE DYNAMICS AND

02:30:14.305 --> 02:30:16.474
BREAKING THOSE CYCLES, WE CAN

02:30:16.540 --> 02:30:19.210
HAVE A HEALTHIER OUTCOME FOR

02:30:19.276 --> 02:30:20.277
