00:36:07.298 --> 00:36:09.500
PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME,

00:36:09.567 --> 00:36:13.070
AFFILIATION AND POSITION. I DO

00:36:13.137 --> 00:36:15.940
ALSO WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO

00:36:16.007 --> 00:36:17.742
MENTION TWO BILLS THAT WERE

00:36:17.808 --> 00:36:19.577
ORIGINALLY SET FOR TODAY'S

00:36:19.644 --> 00:36:22.380
HEARING, SB 237 BY SENATOR

00:36:22.446 --> 00:36:24.849
GRAYSON AND SB 540 BY SENATOR

00:36:24.916 --> 00:36:27.618
BECKER. WHILE THOSE PROPOSALS

00:36:27.685 --> 00:36:29.921
ARE NOT ON TODAY'S AGENDA, I

00:36:29.987 --> 00:36:32.757
WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT MY

00:36:32.823 --> 00:36:34.225
COMMITMENT AND THE ASSEMBLY'S

00:36:34.292 --> 00:36:36.761
COMMITMENT BROADLY TO ADDRESS

00:36:36.827 --> 00:36:39.664
THESE CRITICAL ISSUES AND

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:42.934
CHALLENGES. THERE IS INCREDIBLE

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.137
URGENCY FOR US TO ACT ON THE

00:36:46.203 --> 00:36:47.572
CHALLENGES PRESENTED IN BOTH OF

00:36:47.638 --> 00:36:49.740
THESE MEASURES. CALIFORNIA NEEDS

00:36:49.807 --> 00:36:51.909
TO WORK WITH OTHER STATES TO

00:36:51.976 --> 00:36:53.678
ADDRESS OUR AFFORDABILITY AND

00:36:53.744 --> 00:36:55.513
RELIABILITY CHALLENGES, BOTH IN

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:58.549
THE ELECTRICITY AND PETROLEUM

00:36:58.616 --> 00:37:00.551
SECTOR. AS I SAID, THERE'S

00:37:00.618 --> 00:37:01.686
URGENT THERE'S URGENCY FOR US TO

00:37:01.752 --> 00:37:03.421
ACT THIS YEAR. THERE IS ALSO

00:37:03.487 --> 00:37:05.656
EQUAL URGENCY TO ENSURE THAT WE

00:37:05.723 --> 00:37:08.693
GET THESE POLICIES RIGHT. THE

00:37:08.759 --> 00:37:12.029
STAKES ARE SIMPLY TOO HIGH FOR

00:37:12.096 --> 00:37:14.932
US TO EITHER ADVANCE A SOLUTION

00:37:14.999 --> 00:37:17.134
THAT IS INADEQUATE, OR FOR US TO

00:37:17.201 --> 00:37:19.503
FAIL TO ADVANCE A SOLUTION

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:21.038
WHATSOEVER. THERE'S TOO MUCH AT

00:37:21.105 --> 00:37:22.807
STAKE FOR THE RELIABILITY AND

00:37:22.873 --> 00:37:23.908
AFFORDABILITY OF CALIFORNIA'S

00:37:23.975 --> 00:37:25.676
ENERGY SYSTEM. AND I ALSO

00:37:25.743 --> 00:37:26.877
BELIEVE THERE'S TOO MUCH AT

00:37:26.944 --> 00:37:29.013
STAKE FOR OUR ECONOMY AND THE

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:31.515
FUTURE OF THE STATE AS A WHOLE.

00:37:31.582 --> 00:37:33.417
SO I AM CONFIDENT THAT TOGETHER,

00:37:33.484 --> 00:37:35.519
WE WILL FIND SOLUTIONS TO BOTH

00:37:35.586 --> 00:37:37.588
OF THESE POLICY ISSUE AREAS AND

00:37:37.655 --> 00:37:38.823
LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO

00:37:38.889 --> 00:37:41.192
WORK WITH MY COLLEAGUES IN THE

00:37:41.258 --> 00:37:43.127
ASSEMBLY, OUR PARTNERS IN THE

00:37:43.194 --> 00:37:45.496
STATE SENATE, AND THE GOVERNOR'S

00:37:45.563 --> 00:37:47.331
OFFICE AS WELL, TO ENSURE THAT

00:37:47.398 --> 00:37:50.534
WE LAND THE MANY IMPORTANT

00:37:50.601 --> 00:37:51.869
CLIMATE AND ENERGY PLANES THAT

00:37:51.936 --> 00:37:54.839
WE NEED TO LAND BEFORE WE BREAK

00:37:54.905 --> 00:37:56.240
SESSION ON SEPTEMBER THE 12TH.

00:37:56.307 --> 00:37:58.943
SO WITH THAT, I THINK WE ARE

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:01.712
READY TO BEGIN. WE DO NOT HAVE A

00:38:01.779 --> 00:38:02.613
QUORUM, SO WE'RE GOING TO GO

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:04.915
AHEAD AND GET STARTED AS A

00:38:04.982 --> 00:38:05.983
SUBCOMMITTEE. WE ALSO DO NOT

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:09.920
CURRENTLY HAVE ANY AUTHORS, SO

00:38:09.987 --> 00:38:14.025
WE'RE I WILL THE OTHERWISE WE

00:38:14.091 --> 00:38:15.459
ARE READY TO ROLL. ALL RIGHT.

00:38:15.526 --> 00:38:18.729
THE FIRST ITEM ON TODAY'S AGENDA

00:38:18.796 --> 00:38:21.565
IS SENATOR BECKER'S SB 254,

00:38:21.632 --> 00:38:24.201
FOLLOWED BY SENATOR CERVANTES,

CABALLERO. SO THANK YOU. PLEASE,

00:38:33.177 --> 00:38:34.945
STAFF MEMBERS OF THOSE SENATORS,

00:38:35.012 --> 00:38:38.849
HAVE THEM COME JOIN US IN ROOM

00:38:38.916 --> 00:38:43.287
437. IT'S OUR LAST HEARING. I'M

00:38:43.354 --> 00:39:08.612
HAPPY. TO.

00:48:39.383 --> 00:48:41.518
WE ARE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND

00:48:41.585 --> 00:48:43.153
BEGIN WITH FILE ITEM NUMBER ONE.

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:46.923
WELCOME, SENATOR BECKER. THE

00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:52.129

00:48:52.195 --> 00:48:55.799

Þ. HOW ARE YOU? I APPRECIATE THE

00:49:04.374 --> 00:49:05.075
FLEXIBILITY HERE AT THE

00:49:05.142 --> 00:49:08.278
ASSEMBLY. ENERGY, INDEED. OKAY,

00:49:08.345 --> 00:49:11.515
WELL, THANK YOU, CHAIR. AND

00:49:11.581 --> 00:49:13.784
MEMBERS FIRST. ALSO, THANK THE

00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:15.686
STAFF FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL

00:49:15.752 --> 00:49:18.021
AND ESPECIALLY THE NEXT BILL

00:49:18.088 --> 00:49:20.891
THAT I WILL BE PRESENTING. AND I

00:49:20.957 --> 00:49:22.492
DON'T NEED TO TELL A LOT OF YOU

00:49:22.559 --> 00:49:23.760
THIS BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN

00:49:23.827 --> 00:49:26.496
FOCUSED ON THIS THROUGHOUT THIS

00:49:26.563 --> 00:49:30.801
ENTIRE YEAR, BUT YOU YOU HEAR

00:49:30.867 --> 00:49:32.803
ALL THE TIME, WE HEAR ALL HERE

00:49:32.869 --> 00:49:33.870
ALL THE TIME FROM OUR

00:49:33.937 --> 00:49:34.771
CONSTITUENTS. AND I HEAR ALL THE

00:49:34.838 --> 00:49:37.607
TIME FROM MY WIFE ABOUT RISING

00:49:37.674 --> 00:49:39.810
ENERGY BILLS. OVER THE LAST TEN

00:49:39.876 --> 00:49:41.278
YEARS, RESIDENTIAL RATES HAVE

00:49:41.345 --> 00:49:45.415
GONE UP 82% FOR CUSTOMERS, 90%

00:49:45.482 --> 00:49:48.118
FOR SOCAL EDISON CUSTOMERS, 110%

00:49:48.185 --> 00:49:50.520
FOR PGE CUSTOMERS. EDISON'S AND

00:49:50.587 --> 00:49:51.588
PGE CUSTOMERS HAVE SEEN AN

00:49:51.655 --> 00:49:54.891
INCREASE OF 50% LAST THREE YEARS

00:49:54.958 --> 00:49:57.260
ALONE. NOW I WILL SAY, YOU KNOW

00:49:57.327 --> 00:49:59.963
THAT WE'VE SEEN SOME GOOD SIGNS

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:00.731
FROM THIS YEAR OF THINGS

00:50:00.797 --> 00:50:02.766
STARTING TO MOVE IN THE RIGHT

00:50:02.833 --> 00:50:03.700
DIRECTION. BUT OF COURSE, WE'RE

00:50:03.767 --> 00:50:04.968
STILL HEARING FROM OUR

00:50:05.035 --> 00:50:05.969
CONSTITUENTS ABOUT THE INCREASES

00:50:06.036 --> 00:50:08.205
IN THE PREVIOUS YEARS. THIS BILL

00:50:08.271 --> 00:50:09.673
IS REALLY THE PRODUCT OF MONTHS

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:13.143
OF EFFORT FROM MY STAFF, THE

00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:14.511
TEAM, THE AFFORDABILITY WORKING

00:50:14.578 --> 00:50:16.880
GROUP CONVENED IN THE SENATE.

00:50:16.947 --> 00:50:17.914
AND IT'S REALLY, YOU KNOW, WE

00:50:17.981 --> 00:50:20.751
VIEW THIS AS OUR THE MOST

00:50:20.817 --> 00:50:24.654
AMBITIOUS ATTEMPT THAT WE'VE HAD

00:50:24.721 --> 00:50:26.423
IN A LONG TIME TO REALLY GET AT

00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:29.793
SOME OF THE ROOTS OF THESE

00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:30.894
RISING RATES. AND WHAT CAN WE DO

00:50:30.961 --> 00:50:33.764
ABOUT THEM FOR THE LONGER TERM?

00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:34.698
IT'S A VERY LONG BILL.

00:50:34.765 --> 00:50:36.166
OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S SOME OVERLAP

00:50:36.233 --> 00:50:39.503
WITH PARTS OF YOUR BILL, CHAIR

00:50:39.569 --> 00:50:41.338
AND SOME PIECES FROM SOME OTHER

00:50:41.405 --> 00:50:43.106
MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY. I KNOW

00:50:43.173 --> 00:50:44.007
WE'RE GOING TO REALLY HAVE A

00:50:44.074 --> 00:50:45.542
CHANCE, I THINK, TO COME

00:50:45.609 --> 00:50:46.576
TOGETHER AFTER THE BREAK TO KIND

00:50:46.643 --> 00:50:48.745
OF TALK THROUGH THOSE. I'LL JUST

00:50:48.812 --> 00:50:50.280
COVER AT A VERY, VERY HIGH LEVEL

00:50:50.347 --> 00:50:52.482
A COUPLE PIECES AROUND, REALLY

00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:54.584
THE SHORT TERM IMPACT AROUND THE

00:50:54.651 --> 00:50:57.587
CLIMATE DIVIDEND TO DEVOTE 100%

00:50:57.654 --> 00:50:58.789
OF THE MONEY TO CUSTOMER CREDIT.

00:50:58.855 --> 00:51:00.724
WE ALSO ALLOCATE LARGER CREDITS

00:51:00.791 --> 00:51:02.459
TO LOW INCOME CARE AND FAIR

00:51:02.526 --> 00:51:03.593
CUSTOMERS, AND THAT'S PART OF

00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:06.496
THE SHORT TERM IMPACT. WE ALSO

00:51:06.563 --> 00:51:07.431
CREATE SOMETHING CALLED THE

00:51:07.497 --> 00:51:08.698
POWER FUND, WHICH IS SOMETHING

00:51:08.765 --> 00:51:09.566
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT FOR A LONG

00:51:09.633 --> 00:51:11.635
TIME, WHICH IS HOW DO WE GET

00:51:11.701 --> 00:51:13.537
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE

00:51:13.603 --> 00:51:15.138
CONTRIBUTED TO RISING RATES LIKE

00:51:15.205 --> 00:51:17.641
WILDFIRE COSTS AND EVEN, SAY,

00:51:17.707 --> 00:51:19.242
THE CARE AND FAIR PROGRAMS

00:51:19.309 --> 00:51:22.579
THEMSELVES OUT OF RATES, AND

00:51:22.646 --> 00:51:24.181
WHICH ARE REALLY A PRETTY

00:51:24.247 --> 00:51:25.182
REGRESSIVE INSTRUMENT WHEN WE

00:51:25.248 --> 00:51:27.184
PUT THINGS INTO RATES, AS YOU

00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:28.685
KNOW, AND, YOU KNOW, GET IT MORE

00:51:28.752 --> 00:51:30.520
INTO THE GENERAL FUND. AND SO

00:51:30.587 --> 00:51:32.656
THIS POWER FUND SETS UP THIS

00:51:32.722 --> 00:51:33.290
INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT WHEN WE

00:51:33.356 --> 00:51:35.258
DO DECIDE TO ALLOCATE MONEY,

00:51:35.325 --> 00:51:36.693
WHEN WE HOPEFULLY HAVE MONEY FOR

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:38.028
THAT AGAIN AND SURPLUSES AGAIN,

00:51:38.094 --> 00:51:40.997
THAT WE CAN ALLOCATE THAT. AND

00:51:41.064 --> 00:51:43.400
THEN THERE'S PIECES AROUND A

00:51:43.467 --> 00:51:44.634
NUMBER OF PROVISIONS AROUND

00:51:44.701 --> 00:51:46.169
TIGHTER SCRUTINY ON RATE SETTING

00:51:46.236 --> 00:51:48.805
AND UTILITY PROFITS, MORE

00:51:48.872 --> 00:51:50.240
TRANSPARENCY. THERE'S A PIECE

00:51:50.307 --> 00:51:52.943
HERE AROUND HAVING AT LEAST ONE

00:51:53.009 --> 00:51:55.846
SPENDING PLAN THAT IS BELOW THE

00:51:55.912 --> 00:51:57.581
RATE OF INFLATION, WHICH WE

00:51:57.647 --> 00:52:00.083
THINK WILL HELP THE PUC TO KEEP

00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:02.118
RATES LOW. PUBLIC JUSTIFICATION

00:52:02.185 --> 00:52:03.320
EVERY TIME THERE'S A RATE

00:52:03.386 --> 00:52:04.387
INCREASE THAT ARE REALLY

00:52:04.454 --> 00:52:06.857
IMPORTANT, THERE'S A WHOLE PIECE

00:52:06.923 --> 00:52:07.491
HERE AROUND WILDFIRE SPENDING.

00:52:07.557 --> 00:52:08.792
MAKE SURE WE'RE GETTING BANG FOR

00:52:08.859 --> 00:52:10.694
THE BUCK AND WILDFIRE SPENDING.

00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:11.761
AND PART OF THAT COMES THROUGH

00:52:11.828 --> 00:52:13.029
WAS FAIRLY NEGOTIATED LAST YEAR

00:52:13.096 --> 00:52:15.198
BUT DIDN'T MAKE IT OVER THE

00:52:15.265 --> 00:52:16.566
FINISH LINE. SO THERE'S A LARGE

00:52:16.633 --> 00:52:17.968
PART OF THE BILLS ON WILDFIRE

00:52:18.034 --> 00:52:18.768
SPENDING. AND THEN TWO THINGS

00:52:18.835 --> 00:52:21.071
THAT WE THINK WILL HAVE A BIG

00:52:21.137 --> 00:52:21.771
IMPACT, I'M SURE WE'LL HEAR

00:52:21.838 --> 00:52:24.641
ABOUT IN A MOMENT IN THE REALLY

00:52:24.708 --> 00:52:26.009
IN THE MEDIUM TERM AND LONGER

00:52:26.076 --> 00:52:31.381
TERM AROUND SECURITIZATION OF

00:52:31.448 --> 00:52:33.016
REQUIRES TO FINANCE 15 BILLION

00:52:33.083 --> 00:52:34.551
OF FUTURE SPENDING VIA

00:52:34.618 --> 00:52:36.119
SECURITIZATION. AGAIN, SOME

00:52:36.186 --> 00:52:37.020
OVERLAP HERE WITH SOME WORK THAT

00:52:37.087 --> 00:52:38.188
THAT YOU'RE DOING. AND ACTUALLY,

00:52:38.255 --> 00:52:39.890
I LIKE YOUR APPROACH ABOUT SOME

00:52:39.956 --> 00:52:41.157
OF THE THINGS THAT YOU FOCUS

00:52:41.224 --> 00:52:43.493
THAT, THAT, THAT ON. AND THEN

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:46.696
ALSO AROUND PUBLIC FUNDING OF

00:52:46.763 --> 00:52:48.999
INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE, THE,

00:52:49.065 --> 00:52:51.167
THE, THE POTENTIAL SAVINGS

00:52:51.234 --> 00:52:52.435
THERE. AND AGAIN, THANK YOU FOR

00:52:52.502 --> 00:52:55.438
YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THAT AREA AS

00:52:55.505 --> 00:52:57.874
WELL. THERE'S OTHER PARTS HERE.

00:52:57.941 --> 00:52:59.776
I'LL JUST THE LAST PART THAT

00:52:59.843 --> 00:53:01.478
I'LL TALK ABOUT IS REALLY ABOUT

00:53:01.545 --> 00:53:03.079
THE STREAMLINING. SO ANOTHER

00:53:03.146 --> 00:53:04.281
ISSUE I KNOW THAT WE SHARE

00:53:04.347 --> 00:53:05.649
BETWEEN THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY

00:53:05.715 --> 00:53:06.917
IS TO DO REALLY SIGNIFICANT

00:53:06.983 --> 00:53:07.951
STREAMLINING. AND SO THE

00:53:08.018 --> 00:53:10.153
QUESTION IS REALLY WHAT IS GOING

00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:11.621
TO HAVE AN IMPACT TO ACTUALLY

00:53:11.688 --> 00:53:14.791
GET THINGS MOVED MOVING QUICKER.

00:53:14.858 --> 00:53:16.693
AND SO WE HAVE A NUMBER OF

00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:19.563
PIECES HERE RELATED TO THAT,

00:53:19.629 --> 00:53:21.698
THAT WE THINK WE THINK CAN

00:53:21.765 --> 00:53:23.633
REALLY HELP, BUT ALWAYS OPEN TO

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:24.701
MORE SUGGESTIONS, EITHER FROM

00:53:24.768 --> 00:53:27.437
THE COMMITTEE OR FROM FROM THE

00:53:27.504 --> 00:53:28.572
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH

00:53:28.638 --> 00:53:29.172
STAKEHOLDERS. WHAT'S ACTUALLY

00:53:29.239 --> 00:53:31.374
GOING TO GET THINGS TO MOVE MORE

00:53:31.441 --> 00:53:33.877
QUICKLY WITH THAT? AGAIN, I LOOK

00:53:33.944 --> 00:53:35.178
FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH

00:53:35.245 --> 00:53:38.615
YOU, CHAIR, AND THE COMMITTEE ON

00:53:38.682 --> 00:53:39.983

00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:41.484
PARTS OF THESE, WHICH OF THESE

00:53:41.551 --> 00:53:43.053
IDEAS TO MOVE FORWARD AND WHICH

00:53:43.119 --> 00:53:45.155
VEHICLES AND HOW DO WE, YOU

00:53:45.221 --> 00:53:45.789
KNOW, REALLY ACCOMPLISH WHAT WE

00:53:45.855 --> 00:53:47.891
ALL WANT, WHICH IS TO REDUCE

00:53:47.958 --> 00:53:48.892
BILLS FOR CONSUMERS. AND I'M

00:53:48.959 --> 00:53:50.827
VERY GRATEFUL TO HAVE MATT

00:53:50.894 --> 00:53:53.530

YOUR TESTIMONY, WE'RE JUST GOING

00:53:57.801 --> 00:53:59.436
TO PAUSE FOR A MOMENT TO

00:53:59.502 --> 00:54:01.671
ESTABLISH QUORUM PETRIE-NORRIS

00:54:01.738 --> 00:54:03.773

QUORUM. THE FLOOR IS YOURS.

00:54:36.773 --> 00:54:37.874
THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR. MEMBERS

00:54:37.941 --> 00:54:38.875
OF THE COMMITTEE, MATT FRIEDMAN

00:54:38.942 --> 00:54:40.777
HERE ON BEHALF OF THE UTILITY

00:54:40.844 --> 00:54:41.911
REFORM NETWORK, WE'RE HERE IN

00:54:41.978 --> 00:54:43.346
STRONG SUPPORT OF SB 254. THIS

00:54:43.413 --> 00:54:45.215
BILL CONTAINS A SERIES OF

00:54:45.281 --> 00:54:46.850
SIGNIFICANT MEASURES DESIGNED TO

00:54:46.916 --> 00:54:48.451
REDUCE LONG TERM UTILITY

00:54:48.518 --> 00:54:49.953
SPENDING AND RATEPAYER COSTS,

00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:51.721
WHILE ALSO PROVIDING BADLY

00:54:51.788 --> 00:54:53.390
NEEDED SHORT TERM RATE RELIEF IF

00:54:53.456 --> 00:54:54.691
EXPECTED. WE THINK THIS BILL

00:54:54.758 --> 00:54:57.127
WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON

00:54:57.193 --> 00:54:57.794
THE AFFORDABILITY OF ELECTRICITY

00:54:57.861 --> 00:54:59.295
OVER THE COMING DECADES. IN

00:54:59.362 --> 00:55:00.830
PARTICULAR, WE SUPPORT A NUMBER

00:55:00.897 --> 00:55:02.065
OF THE KEY PROVISIONS OF THIS

00:55:02.132 --> 00:55:04.367
BILL, INCLUDING ESTABLISHING A

00:55:04.434 --> 00:55:05.402
CLEAN ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE

00:55:05.468 --> 00:55:07.070
AUTHORITY CAPABLE OF FINANCING

00:55:07.137 --> 00:55:08.538
AND OWNING NEW GRID

00:55:08.605 --> 00:55:09.673
INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING

00:55:09.739 --> 00:55:11.908
ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION, PUBLIC

00:55:11.975 --> 00:55:13.343
OWNERSHIP OF TRANSMISSION USING

00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:15.779
LOW COST PUBLIC FINANCING CAN

00:55:15.845 --> 00:55:17.213
REDUCE THE LONG TERM COST PASSED

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.449
ON TO RATEPAYERS BY MORE THAN

00:55:19.516 --> 00:55:20.850
50% COMPARED TO PRIVATE

00:55:20.917 --> 00:55:22.285
OWNERSHIP. TOTAL RATEPAYER

00:55:22.352 --> 00:55:23.586
SAVINGS FROM PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF

00:55:23.653 --> 00:55:25.255
NEW COMPETITIVELY BID

00:55:25.321 --> 00:55:26.156
TRANSMISSION PROJECTS COULD

00:55:26.222 --> 00:55:29.559
AMOUNT TO $3 BILLION PER YEAR.

00:55:29.626 --> 00:55:31.194
TO PURSUE THIS APPROACH, THE

00:55:31.261 --> 00:55:32.462
STATE NEEDS TO EMPOWER AN AGENCY

00:55:32.529 --> 00:55:33.730
OR AN ENTITY THAT CAN SERVE AS

00:55:33.797 --> 00:55:35.732
THE LEAD SPONSOR FOR PUBLICLY

00:55:35.799 --> 00:55:37.534
OWNED TRANSMISSION. THERE'S NO

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:38.702
AGENCY AGENCY CURRENTLY EQUIPPED

00:55:38.768 --> 00:55:41.271
TO PERFORM THIS ROLE, BUT SB 254

00:55:41.337 --> 00:55:42.372
WOULD ESTABLISH AN

00:55:42.439 --> 00:55:43.873
INFRASTRUCTURE AUTHORITY CAPABLE

00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:46.076
OF STANDING IN THIS PLACE.

00:55:46.142 --> 00:55:47.677
SECOND, THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE

00:55:47.744 --> 00:55:48.712
THE MAJOR INVESTOR OWNED

00:55:48.778 --> 00:55:50.513
UTILITIES TO FINANCE $15 BILLION

00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:52.515
IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATING

00:55:52.582 --> 00:55:53.950
TO WILDFIRE MITIGATION AND

00:55:54.017 --> 00:55:55.518
CUSTOMER ENERGIZATION USING

00:55:55.585 --> 00:55:57.287
RATEPAYER BACKED SECURITIZED

00:55:57.353 --> 00:55:58.988
DEBT. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS COULD

00:55:59.055 --> 00:56:00.223
REDUCE COST TO RATEPAYERS BY

00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:02.525
MORE THAN ONE THIRD, AND IT'S

00:56:02.592 --> 00:56:04.060
APPROPRIATE IN RESPONSE TO THE

00:56:04.127 --> 00:56:05.462
MASSIVE INCREASE IN CAPITAL

00:56:05.528 --> 00:56:07.030
EXPENDITURES PROPOSED BY THE

00:56:07.097 --> 00:56:08.198
THREE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES

00:56:08.264 --> 00:56:10.467
THAT ARE PROPOSING $90 BILLION

00:56:10.533 --> 00:56:11.601
IN NEW CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

00:56:11.668 --> 00:56:14.104
THROUGH 2028. THE SECURITIZATION

00:56:14.170 --> 00:56:15.171
IN THIS BILL WOULD SAVE

00:56:15.238 --> 00:56:17.574
RATEPAYERS APPROXIMATELY $7.5

00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:18.908
BILLION OVER THE FIRST DECADE,

00:56:18.975 --> 00:56:20.310
WITH RATE REDUCTIONS AVERAGING

00:56:20.376 --> 00:56:23.213
ABOUT 4 TO $5 A MONTH FOR

00:56:23.279 --> 00:56:23.813
RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS. IT'S A

00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:24.981
MECHANISM THAT'S BEEN USED

00:56:25.048 --> 00:56:26.349
PREVIOUSLY FOR WILDFIRE

00:56:26.416 --> 00:56:27.917
MITIGATION, WILDFIRE LIABILITY

00:56:27.984 --> 00:56:29.552
AND OTHER PURPOSES. SO THE

00:56:29.619 --> 00:56:30.787
LEGISLATURE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY

00:56:30.854 --> 00:56:32.756
TO USE THIS TO BEND THE CURVE OF

00:56:32.822 --> 00:56:34.190
FUTURE COSTS AND SUBSTITUTE

00:56:34.257 --> 00:56:35.792
LOWER COST ALTERNATIVE

00:56:35.859 --> 00:56:37.260
FINANCING. WE ALSO STRONGLY

00:56:37.327 --> 00:56:38.962
SUPPORT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A

00:56:39.028 --> 00:56:40.330
BENCHMARK FOR UTILITY SPENDING

00:56:40.396 --> 00:56:42.532
INCREASES TIED TO INFLATION, THE

00:56:42.599 --> 00:56:44.033
PRIMARY DRIVER OF MASSIVE RATE

00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:45.835
INCREASES OVER THE LAST FIVE

00:56:45.902 --> 00:56:46.803
YEARS IS INCREASED UTILITY

00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:48.338
SPENDING. TO GET A HANDLE ON

00:56:48.404 --> 00:56:50.273
RATES, SPENDING MUST BE SUBJECT

00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:51.307
TO GREATER SCRUTINY BY THE

00:56:51.374 --> 00:56:52.776
PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION, AND

00:56:52.842 --> 00:56:54.210
THIS BILL TACKLES THIS PROBLEM

00:56:54.277 --> 00:56:55.979
IN A THOUGHTFUL AND BALANCED

00:56:56.045 --> 00:56:57.881
MANNER. ADDITIONALLY, IMPROVING

00:56:57.947 --> 00:56:59.115
THE REVIEW OF WILDFIRE

00:56:59.182 --> 00:57:00.784
MITIGATION PLANS TO PRIORITIZE

00:57:00.850 --> 00:57:02.418
COST EFFECTIVENESS AND TIMELY

00:57:02.485 --> 00:57:04.921
RISK REDUCTION. CREATING THE

00:57:08.625 --> 00:57:09.592
CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION TO

00:57:09.659 --> 00:57:11.761
CHANNEL EXTERNAL FUNDING SOURCES

00:57:11.828 --> 00:57:13.730
AS THE TO COVER COSTS THAT WOULD

00:57:13.797 --> 00:57:15.665
OTHERWISE BE RECOVERED IN RATES.

00:57:15.732 --> 00:57:17.200
ADDITIONALLY REQUIRING THE PUC

00:57:17.267 --> 00:57:18.668

RATE, BASE CAPITAL STRUCTURE,

00:57:21.237 --> 00:57:23.239
AND RATE OF RETURN, AND THEN

00:57:23.306 --> 00:57:24.707
FINALLY ALLOCATING A LARGER

CALIFORNIA GAS COMPANY AND SGA,

00:59:59.062 --> 01:00:01.798
WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO SB 254 AND

01:00:01.864 --> 01:00:02.632
WOULD NOTE THAT THE BILL HAS NOT

01:00:02.699 --> 01:00:04.467
BEEN AMENDED SINCE FIRST POLICY

01:00:04.534 --> 01:00:05.735
COMMITTEE. WE REMAIN COMMITTED

01:00:05.802 --> 01:00:06.736
TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR, BUT

01:00:06.803 --> 01:00:07.670
WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME

01:00:07.737 --> 01:00:09.639
IMPROVEMENTS TO IT. BACK IN

01:00:09.706 --> 01:00:11.140
2022, THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE

01:00:11.207 --> 01:00:12.809
AUDIT COMMITTEE WAS APPROACHED

01:00:12.875 --> 01:00:14.277
WITH THE IDEA OF CREATING A

01:00:14.344 --> 01:00:16.045
STUDY TO LOOK AT COST DRIVERS.

01:00:16.112 --> 01:00:18.281
THAT REPORT WAS ISSUED ALMOST 24

01:00:18.348 --> 01:00:20.316
MONTHS AGO. NEXT MONTH IT WILL

01:00:20.383 --> 01:00:22.185
BE TWO YEARS AGO. SINCE THAT

01:00:22.251 --> 01:00:23.586
TIME, THE LAO HAS ISSUED

01:00:23.653 --> 01:00:25.154
REPORTS. OTHER AGENCIES HAVE

01:00:25.221 --> 01:00:26.089
ISSUED REPORTS. THE GOVERNOR

01:00:26.155 --> 01:00:27.323
ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER

01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:29.692
CALLING ON THE PUC TO REPORT ON

01:00:29.759 --> 01:00:32.395
COST SAVING OPPORTUNITIES. THEY

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:34.831
ALL CARRY THIS COMMON THEME THAT

01:00:34.897 --> 01:00:36.032
UTILITY RATES ARE DRIVEN LARGELY

01:00:36.099 --> 01:00:37.667
BY LEGAL REQUIREMENTS,

01:00:37.734 --> 01:00:38.434
REGULATIONS, AND STATE AND

01:00:38.501 --> 01:00:40.903
FEDERAL MANDATES. IN OUR BELIEF,

01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:42.739
SB 254 FAILS TO ADDRESS THE

01:00:42.805 --> 01:00:43.773
UNDERLYING COST DRIVERS OF

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:45.208
TODAY'S RATES AND PROVIDE

01:00:45.274 --> 01:00:47.110
DIRECTION ON WHICH MANDATORY

01:00:47.176 --> 01:00:49.545
ACTIVITY SHOULD BE SET ASIDE. SB

01:00:49.612 --> 01:00:51.147
254 IS CURRENTLY DRAFTED, DOES

01:00:51.214 --> 01:00:53.549
NOT PROVIDE IMMEDIATE RELIEF THE

01:00:53.616 --> 01:00:54.851
CUSTOMERS NEED, AND WE CONTINUE

01:00:54.917 --> 01:00:56.519
TO HOLD OUT HOPE THAT THAT WILL

01:00:56.586 --> 01:00:58.955
BE CONSIDERED THIS YEAR.

01:00:59.022 --> 01:01:00.056
SPECIFICALLY, OUR CONCERNS ON

01:01:00.123 --> 01:01:02.825
THE COLA LIMITATIONS. AT A

01:01:02.892 --> 01:01:04.160
MINIMUM, WE'D WE'D SUGGEST

01:01:04.227 --> 01:01:05.595
STRIKING THE PROVISIONS RELATIVE

01:01:05.661 --> 01:01:07.163
TO GAS CORPORATIONS. THE

01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:08.664
AFFORDABILITY DISCUSSION IS ON

01:01:08.731 --> 01:01:10.433
ELECTRICITY. I THINK WE SHOULD

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.268
FOCUS. THEIR ELECTRICITY

01:01:12.335 --> 01:01:13.369
SERVICES ARE FUNDAMENTALLY

01:01:13.436 --> 01:01:14.737
DIFFERENT THAN OTHER GOODS AND

01:01:14.804 --> 01:01:16.973
SERVICES AS OPERATE AS UTILITIES

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:18.474
OPERATE UNDER AN EXTENSIVE WEB

01:01:18.541 --> 01:01:20.510
OF STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS AND

01:01:20.576 --> 01:01:21.978
MANDATES BEYOND SAFETY AND

01:01:22.045 --> 01:01:23.279
RELIABILITY, FORCING UTILITIES

01:01:23.346 --> 01:01:25.548
TO PROPOSE RATES UNTETHERED FROM

01:01:25.615 --> 01:01:27.483
ACTUAL COSTS, WHICH UNDERMINE

01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:28.818
THE WIDE VARIETY OF PUBLIC

01:01:28.885 --> 01:01:30.653
POLICY PROGRAMS, INCLUDING

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:32.021
WILDFIRE MITIGATION AND CLEAN

01:01:32.088 --> 01:01:33.956
ENERGY GOALS. AND I WOULD NOTE

01:01:34.023 --> 01:01:36.726
ALSO THE PUC'S EXISTING PROCESS

01:01:36.793 --> 01:01:38.895
FOR REVIEWING INCREASES. THEY DO

01:01:38.961 --> 01:01:40.396
A JUST AND REASONABLE STANDARD.

01:01:40.463 --> 01:01:42.031
SO THERE IS A REVIEW ALREADY

01:01:42.098 --> 01:01:44.634
DONE. SECOND, SB 254 FORCES US

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:46.402
TO MAKE A COLLECTIVE $15 BILLION

01:01:46.469 --> 01:01:49.305
OF INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:51.607
OUR ALLOCATION OF THAT $15

01:01:51.674 --> 01:01:52.875
BILLION WOULD SAVE CUSTOMERS IN

01:01:52.942 --> 01:01:55.244
YEAR ONE ABOUT $0.08 A MONTH. IN

01:01:55.311 --> 01:01:56.879
YEAR SEVEN IT BALLOONS TO ABOUT

01:01:56.946 --> 01:01:58.748
$0.12 A MONTH. WE THINK WE NEED

01:01:58.815 --> 01:02:01.984
TO DO MORE HERE. AT THE TIME, IN

01:02:02.051 --> 01:02:04.821
THE LAST MONTH, BARCLAYS, UBS,

01:02:04.887 --> 01:02:06.522
WOLFE RESEARCH, JEFFERIES,

01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:07.757
CITIGROUP HAVE ALL ISSUED

01:02:07.824 --> 01:02:09.459
REPORTS ABOUT THIS BILL AND

01:02:09.525 --> 01:02:11.194
ABOUT THE STATE'S WILDFIRE FUND

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:13.930
AND THE CONDITION OF IT. WE

01:02:13.996 --> 01:02:15.565
THINK MORE DISCUSSION HAS TO BE

01:02:15.631 --> 01:02:16.999
DONE THERE. FINALLY, ON THIS

01:02:17.066 --> 01:02:18.468
POWER FUND, WE SUPPORT THE

01:02:18.534 --> 01:02:20.136
DIRECTION OF THAT. WE THINK

01:02:20.203 --> 01:02:22.038
MONEY SHOULD BE PUT INTO IT AND

01:02:22.105 --> 01:02:23.206
AFFORDABILITY SHOULD BE A FOCUS.

01:02:23.272 --> 01:02:24.674
AND WE SHOULD TAKE ACTION NOW TO

01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:27.076
REDUCE RATES. WITH THAT, WE

01:02:27.143 --> 01:02:30.079
REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL.

01:02:30.146 --> 01:02:31.314
MADAM CHAIR, MEMBERS, ON BEHALF

01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:32.515
OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF

01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:33.816
UTILITY EMPLOYEES AND THE STATE

01:02:33.883 --> 01:02:35.084
ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL

01:02:35.151 --> 01:02:37.553
WORKERS, WE ARE OPPOSED UNLESS

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:40.022
AMENDED. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:41.491
POSITIVELY WITH THE AUTHOR SINCE

01:02:41.557 --> 01:02:44.160
THE OUTSET. WE'VE GIVEN HIM SOME

01:02:44.227 --> 01:02:46.262
AMENDMENTS. THERE'S, AS MR.

01:02:46.329 --> 01:02:48.131
COUCH POINTED OUT, THERE HASN'T

01:02:48.197 --> 01:02:49.098
BEEN ANY SUBSTANTIVE AMENDMENTS

01:02:49.165 --> 01:02:50.233
SINCE THIS FIRST POLICY

01:02:50.299 --> 01:02:51.701
COMMITTEE. THERE'S A LOT OF

01:02:51.767 --> 01:02:53.136
THINGS IN THIS BILL THAT JUST

01:02:53.202 --> 01:02:54.704
NEED TO BE TIGHTENED UP AND

01:02:54.770 --> 01:02:55.738
FIXED. WE THINK THERE'S A

01:02:55.805 --> 01:02:58.674
PATHWAY FOR MANY OF THEM. BUT

01:02:58.741 --> 01:03:02.178
FOR INSTANCE, ON THE CONSTRAINED

01:03:02.245 --> 01:03:04.580
GRC THAT'S TIED TO INFLATION,

01:03:04.647 --> 01:03:06.382
YOU GOT TO HAVE IT. SO IT'S

01:03:06.449 --> 01:03:08.885
APPLES TO APPLES. THERE ARE

01:03:08.951 --> 01:03:11.454
CERTAIN COSTS THAT, YOU KNOW,

01:03:11.521 --> 01:03:13.055
SHOULD THERE SHOULD BE EXEMPTED

01:03:13.122 --> 01:03:14.657
OUT OF THAT PARTICULAR PROCESS.

01:03:14.724 --> 01:03:16.192
THINGS LIKE COSTS THAT ARE

01:03:16.259 --> 01:03:17.927
OUTSIDE THE UTILITY'S CONTROL

01:03:17.994 --> 01:03:19.862
BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE AFFECTED

01:03:19.929 --> 01:03:22.431
BY TARIFFS, 50% TARIFF ON COPPER

01:03:22.498 --> 01:03:24.367
THAT WAS JUST ADOPTED THIS WEEK.

01:03:24.433 --> 01:03:26.903
LABOR COSTS, OTHER REGULATORY

01:03:26.969 --> 01:03:29.338
RELATED COSTS. ON THE

01:03:29.405 --> 01:03:29.939
SECURITIZATION. WE THINK THERE

01:03:30.006 --> 01:03:31.574
SHOULD BE A PRIORITIZATION. WE

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:34.110
CAN'T SECURITIZE EVERYTHING

01:03:34.177 --> 01:03:35.511
WILDFIRE LIABILITY AND MAKING

01:03:35.578 --> 01:03:37.246
SURE THAT VICTIMS OF WILDFIRES

01:03:37.313 --> 01:03:40.116
ARE PAID SHOULD TAKE A

01:03:40.183 --> 01:03:42.418
PRECEDENCE OVER BEFORE OTHER

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:44.353
SECURITIZATION IS DONE. AND

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:49.225
FINALLY, THERE NEEDS TO BE AN

01:03:49.292 --> 01:03:51.394
ALL DUE RESPECT TO TURN THERE.

01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:53.596
WE HAVE NOT SEEN AN ECONOMIC

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:55.464
ANALYSIS THAT POINTS TO A $7.5

01:03:55.531 --> 01:03:57.266
BILLION SAVINGS DONE BY ANY SORT

01:03:57.333 --> 01:04:00.236
OF AN INDEPENDENT SORT OF

01:04:00.303 --> 01:04:02.138
ENTITY. AND NOW THAT WE HAVE A

01:04:02.205 --> 01:04:03.639
SUMMER RECESS, WE SHOULD BE

01:04:03.706 --> 01:04:05.841
HERE. WE ALL GET THINGS WRONG.

01:04:05.908 --> 01:04:07.910
TURN SUPPORTED AB 1890 AND SAID

01:04:07.977 --> 01:04:09.845
IT WAS GOING TO SAVE A WHOLE

01:04:09.912 --> 01:04:11.547
BUNCH OF MONEY, AND WE ENDED UP

01:04:11.614 --> 01:04:14.083
IN AN ENERGY CRISIS. SO WE WOULD

01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:15.484
LIKE TO SEE SOME INDEPENDENT

01:04:15.551 --> 01:04:17.486
ANALYSIS, BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO

01:04:17.553 --> 01:04:18.387
WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. THANK

TESTIMONY, BUT I DID READ I DID

01:06:38.494 --> 01:06:39.662
READ THE BILL. AND THERE IS A

01:06:39.729 --> 01:06:42.331
WHOLE LOT IN THERE. AND WOW. BUT

01:06:42.398 --> 01:06:43.999
ONE OF THE FEW. BUT THANK YOU

01:06:44.066 --> 01:06:45.935
AND PLENTY OF OPPOSITION. BUT I

01:06:46.001 --> 01:06:47.603
DO KNOW THAT THIS IS PART OF A

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:49.538
BIGGER CONVERSATION, SO I WILL

01:06:49.605 --> 01:06:51.240
BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY.

01:06:51.307 --> 01:06:53.509

AUTHOR AND COMMEND HIM FOR HIS

01:06:57.446 --> 01:06:59.615
FOCUS ON AFFORDABILITY. YOU

01:06:59.682 --> 01:07:01.117
KNOW, WHENEVER YOU PUT TOGETHER

01:07:01.183 --> 01:07:03.786
A BIG, BOUNTIFUL BILL, THERE'S A

01:07:03.853 --> 01:07:05.554
LOT OF THINGS IN IT. AND I THINK

01:07:05.621 --> 01:07:07.690
THERE'S SOME GOOD THINGS IN THIS

01:07:07.757 --> 01:07:08.758
AND THERE'S SOME ALSO SOME

01:07:08.824 --> 01:07:11.527
THINGS THAT I HAVE BEEN VERY

01:07:11.594 --> 01:07:14.263
CONCERNED ABOUT AND DID NOT VOTE

01:07:14.330 --> 01:07:15.931
FOR WHEN IT WAS IN OUR HOUSE ON

01:07:15.998 --> 01:07:19.034
SIMILAR BILLS ON OUR SIDE. I'M

01:07:19.101 --> 01:07:20.336
CONCERNED ABOUT SOME OF THE

01:07:20.403 --> 01:07:22.304
THINGS IN THE BILL THAT I THINK

01:07:22.371 --> 01:07:24.173
HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:25.241
DESTABILIZE THE FINANCIAL

01:07:25.307 --> 01:07:26.675
MARKETS AND COULD RESULT IN, I

01:07:26.742 --> 01:07:30.479
THINK, INCREASES IN COSTS TO

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:32.014
RATEPAYERS AND CONSUMERS. I

01:07:32.081 --> 01:07:33.516
THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THE

01:07:33.582 --> 01:07:35.384
VOTES TO GET THIS OUT TODAY.

01:07:35.451 --> 01:07:37.186
BUT, YOU KNOW, I REALLY DO THINK

01:07:37.253 --> 01:07:39.622
THAT THIS IS, YOU KNOW, DOING A

01:07:39.688 --> 01:07:41.223
BILL LIKE THIS, WE SHOULD BE

01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:42.625
ABLE TO CONSIDER EACH OF THE

01:07:42.691 --> 01:07:43.192
PIECES INDIVIDUALLY BECAUSE

01:07:43.259 --> 01:07:44.360
THEY'RE ALL PRETTY SIGNIFICANT.

01:07:44.427 --> 01:07:46.529
AND BECAUSE OF THAT, I'M GOING

01:07:46.595 --> 01:07:50.099
TO BE LAYING OFF TODAY. SO. ALL

01:07:50.166 --> 01:07:52.968
RIGHT, SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS

01:07:53.035 --> 01:07:55.104
WISHING TO ASK A QUESTION OR

01:07:55.171 --> 01:07:58.674
COMMENT, I GUESS, BEFORE I JUMP

01:07:58.741 --> 01:08:00.476
IN WITH A LITTLE BIT OF MY

01:08:00.543 --> 01:08:01.477
COMMENTARY, WOULD YOU LIKE TO

01:08:01.544 --> 01:08:03.312
RESPOND TO THE CONCERNS THAT

01:08:03.379 --> 01:08:04.914
HAVE BEEN RAISED BY THE

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:07.716
OPPOSITION? I APPRECIATE, FIRST

01:08:07.783 --> 01:08:09.819
OF ALL, I'LL SAY I CERTAINLY

01:08:09.885 --> 01:08:11.620
APPRECIATE FOLKS, INCLUDING THE

01:08:11.687 --> 01:08:13.756
IBEW, WHO'VE COME FORWARD WITH

01:08:13.823 --> 01:08:16.292
WITH CREATIVE PROPOSALS AND

01:08:16.358 --> 01:08:17.960
CERTAINLY LISTENING, YOU KNOW,

01:08:18.027 --> 01:08:20.229
WILLING TO LISTEN AND INCLUDING

01:08:20.296 --> 01:08:23.499
IOUS AS WELL, LISTENING TO ANY

01:08:23.566 --> 01:08:24.900
PROPOSALS THAT FOLKS HAVE.

01:08:24.967 --> 01:08:27.102
BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS WELL,

01:08:27.169 --> 01:08:29.839
IT'S A NECESSARY BIT OF A

01:08:29.905 --> 01:08:30.739
CONFRONTATIONAL PROCESS. YOU

01:08:30.806 --> 01:08:32.308
KNOW, WE'RE ALL TRYING TO GET TO

01:08:32.374 --> 01:08:35.044
THE SAME END GOAL HERE OF

01:08:35.110 --> 01:08:38.647
REDUCING BILLS. AND SO ANYWAY,

01:08:38.714 --> 01:08:39.915
I'LL JUST SAY THAT UP FRONT, I

01:08:39.982 --> 01:08:41.951
THINK, YOU KNOW, I WON'T GO SORT

01:08:42.017 --> 01:08:44.887
OF NECESSARILY POINT BY POINT. I

01:08:44.954 --> 01:08:46.822
THINK WE'VE SHOWN AND, YOU KNOW,

01:08:46.889 --> 01:08:48.524
HAPPY TO DISCUSS IN MORE DETAIL.

01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:50.025
THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS IN

01:08:50.092 --> 01:08:51.627
THIS BILL. NOW, THE QUESTION IS,

01:08:51.694 --> 01:08:53.596
YOU KNOW, WHAT CAN YOU DO IN THE

01:08:53.662 --> 01:08:55.064
SHORT TERM VERSUS WHAT CAN YOU

01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:56.799
DO IN THE MEDIUM AND LONGER

01:08:56.866 --> 01:08:58.434
TERM? I DO THINK THE, YOU KNOW,

01:08:58.501 --> 01:09:01.837
THE HAVING ONE RATE CASE, IT

01:09:01.904 --> 01:09:03.672
JUST HAS TO BE ONE. YOU CAN HAVE

01:09:03.739 --> 01:09:04.773
MULTIPLE RATE CASES, BUT ONE

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:05.941
RATE CASE WHERE INFLATION JUST

01:09:06.008 --> 01:09:07.776
SORT OF SETS A STANDARD SO THAT

01:09:07.843 --> 01:09:09.011
PEOPLE SEE, OKAY, WHAT WOULD

01:09:09.078 --> 01:09:10.946
THAT LOOK LIKE. AND I THINK HELP

01:09:11.013 --> 01:09:12.515
WILL HELP BE HELPFUL TO THE PUC

01:09:12.581 --> 01:09:13.816
GOING FORWARD. I MEAN, SOME OF

01:09:13.883 --> 01:09:15.284
THE CONCERNS RAISED ON THE

01:09:15.351 --> 01:09:16.485
SPECIFICALLY AROUND PERMITTING

01:09:16.552 --> 01:09:17.119
AND STREAMLINING, AGAIN, THOSE

01:09:17.186 --> 01:09:18.754
ARE ARE COMPLEX PARTS OF THE

01:09:18.821 --> 01:09:21.690
BILL LOOKING FORWARD TO ENGAGING

01:09:21.757 --> 01:09:23.893
ON THOSE. I MEAN, I THINK THE

01:09:23.959 --> 01:09:27.897
POINT IS THAT THERE'S AND AGAIN,

01:09:27.963 --> 01:09:29.798
I DO SEE THIS AS A PACKAGE, TO

01:09:29.865 --> 01:09:31.267
ME AT LEAST PERSONALLY, WITH

01:09:31.333 --> 01:09:32.668
SOME OF THE 541 WHICH WE'LL

01:09:32.735 --> 01:09:35.504
DISCUSS AND 540, HOW DO WE USE

01:09:35.571 --> 01:09:37.239
OUR EXISTING GRID MORE

01:09:37.306 --> 01:09:38.040
EFFECTIVELY? HOW DO WE MAKE SURE

01:09:38.107 --> 01:09:40.576
WE PROVIDE THE RIGHT INCENTIVES,

01:09:40.643 --> 01:09:42.244
AND HOW DO WE DELIVER FOR

01:09:42.311 --> 01:09:44.647
CUSTOMERS? SO AGAIN, THERE IS

01:09:44.713 --> 01:09:45.915
YOU'RE RIGHT, THERE IS A LOT AND

01:09:45.981 --> 01:09:48.551
I AM I AM IMPRESSED. IF YOU DID

01:09:48.617 --> 01:09:50.519
READ I'M FOR YOU READING THE

01:09:50.586 --> 01:09:51.654
WHOLE BILL. ASSEMBLYMEMBER

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:53.556
ERWIN, THERE'S A LOT IN HERE,

01:09:53.622 --> 01:09:55.024
BUT IT REALLY TACKLES. THAT'S

01:09:55.090 --> 01:09:56.525
WHAT I THINK, WHAT IT TAKES. WE

01:09:56.592 --> 01:09:57.993
HAVE TO TACKLE THE WILDFIRE

01:09:58.060 --> 01:09:59.762
COSTS, RIGHT? WE HAVE TO MAKE

01:09:59.828 --> 01:10:00.829
SURE WE'RE GETTING BANG FOR THE

01:10:00.896 --> 01:10:02.698
BUCK. WE HAVE TO TACKLE THE RATE

01:10:02.765 --> 01:10:04.767
CASE PROCESS. WE HAVE TO SPEED

01:10:04.833 --> 01:10:05.534
UP DEVELOPMENT, WHICH I THINK IS

01:10:05.601 --> 01:10:06.869
SOMETHING WE PROBABLY ALL WE

01:10:06.936 --> 01:10:08.170
WOULD CERTAINLY AGREE ON. WE

01:10:08.237 --> 01:10:09.972
HAVE TO. THAT'S ONE THING THAT

01:10:10.039 --> 01:10:11.373
ADDS SIGNIFICANTLY TO COST ALL

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:13.208
OF OUR DELAYS IN THE PROCESS.

01:10:13.275 --> 01:10:14.843
SO, YOU KNOW, AGAIN, A LOT IN

01:10:14.910 --> 01:10:15.744
HERE. NO, THERE'S A LOT TO LAND

01:10:15.811 --> 01:10:19.181
HERE IN THE NEXT, YOU KNOW,

01:10:19.248 --> 01:10:20.649
WHATEVER, SIX WEEKS. BUT LOOK

01:10:20.716 --> 01:10:21.717

WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND YOU

THANKING YOU FOR YOUR FOCUS ON

01:10:27.156 --> 01:10:28.490
AFFORDABILITY. AND THE BOTTOM

01:10:28.557 --> 01:10:30.125
LINE IS THAT CALIFORNIANS EXPECT

01:10:30.192 --> 01:10:31.794
US TO TAKE A VERY HARD LOOK AT

01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:34.597
THEIR BILLS AND IDENTIFY EVERY

01:10:34.663 --> 01:10:37.066
OPPORTUNITY TO BRING DOWN COSTS

01:10:37.132 --> 01:10:39.034
IN BOTH THE SHORT AND THE LONG

01:10:39.101 --> 01:10:41.470
TERM. AND, YOU KNOW, I KNOW

01:10:41.537 --> 01:10:43.105
THAT'S THE APPROACH THAT WE'VE

01:10:43.172 --> 01:10:43.672
BEEN TAKING ON THE ASSEMBLY

01:10:43.739 --> 01:10:45.608

BEEN DOING AS WELL, AS YOU

MENTIONED, THERE ARE PLACES

01:10:50.145 --> 01:10:51.947
WHERE THERE'S SIMILAR PROPOSALS

01:10:52.014 --> 01:10:53.282
THAT HAVE BEEN ADVANCED BY THE

01:10:53.349 --> 01:10:55.250
ASSEMBLY AND SOME PLACES, YOU

01:10:55.317 --> 01:10:56.485
KNOW, SORT OF OVERLAPPING

01:10:56.552 --> 01:10:58.320
PROPOSALS. SO, YOU KNOW, LOOK

01:10:58.387 --> 01:11:00.189
FORWARD TO CONTINUING

01:11:00.255 --> 01:11:01.657
CONVERSATION IN ORDER TO

01:11:01.724 --> 01:11:02.925
HARMONIZE THOSE EFFORTS. I KNOW

THAT WE START FROM A SHARED GOAL

01:11:06.295 --> 01:11:08.530

01:12:39.722 --> 01:12:42.191
THIS BILL MIGHT BE A NEW WORD TO

01:12:42.257 --> 01:12:43.859
FOLKS SUBJECT MATTER. I JUST

01:12:43.926 --> 01:12:46.261
WANT TO REALLY APPRECIATE THE

01:12:46.328 --> 01:12:46.929
COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE

01:12:46.995 --> 01:12:49.998
STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US. WHEN

01:12:50.065 --> 01:12:52.901
I SAY THAT WE VIEW THIS AS A

01:12:52.968 --> 01:12:58.674
PACKAGE, I, I, I Dð BECAUSE WHEN

01:12:58.741 --> 01:13:00.576
I SAID ON ON TWO, THREE, FOUR ON

01:13:00.642 --> 01:13:02.044
540, WHICH IS A REGIONAL GRID

01:13:02.111 --> 01:13:04.546
BILL, WHICH I KNOW WELL, LOOKING

01:13:04.613 --> 01:13:07.116
FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. AND

01:13:07.182 --> 01:13:11.153
AFTER THE BREAK. YOU KNOW, WHEN

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:12.521
YOU THINK ABOUT IT, ONE THING

01:13:12.588 --> 01:13:15.290
THAT'S BECOME REALLY CLEAR TO ME

01:13:15.357 --> 01:13:17.559
DURING THIS LAST FEW MONTHS IS

01:13:17.626 --> 01:13:21.530
THAT WE ARE ONLY USING A SMALL

01:13:21.597 --> 01:13:23.132
PERCENT OF OUR GRID CAPACITY ON

01:13:23.198 --> 01:13:24.933
A REGULAR BASIS, RIGHT? SO WE

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.802
TALK ABOUT AFFORDABILITY AND

01:13:26.869 --> 01:13:27.870
AFFORDABILITY. IT'S LIKE, OKAY,

01:13:27.936 --> 01:13:29.238
WELL, YOU ALWAYS THINK OF, YOU

01:13:29.304 --> 01:13:31.039
KNOW, IF YOU'RE A PARENT, YOU'RE

01:13:31.106 --> 01:13:32.941
LIKE YOU SAY TO YOUR KID, I WANT

01:13:33.008 --> 01:13:35.277
A NEW PAIR OF SHOES, OKAY. ARE

01:13:35.344 --> 01:13:36.512
WE GETTING, YOU KNOW, ARE WE

01:13:36.578 --> 01:13:37.613
GETTING THE BEST WEAR OUT OF THE

01:13:37.679 --> 01:13:39.948
SHOES YOU ALREADY HAVE. RIGHT.

01:13:40.015 --> 01:13:43.485
AND SO IT'S REALLY ABOUT 45

01:13:43.552 --> 01:13:45.988
HOURS A YEAR THAT THE GRID IS

01:13:46.054 --> 01:13:48.223
UNDER SEVERE STRAIN, ABOUT 45

01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:50.726
HOURS A YEAR. AND THE REST OF

01:13:50.793 --> 01:13:52.494
THE TIME WE'RE USING, ON

01:13:52.561 --> 01:13:54.296
AVERAGE, ABOUT 45% OF THE GRID'S

01:13:54.363 --> 01:13:56.231
CAPACITY. AND THOSE ARE NOT YOU

01:13:56.298 --> 01:13:57.299
KNOW, THOSE ARE PUBLIC NUMBERS.

01:13:57.366 --> 01:14:00.302
I WAS AT AN EVENT WITH THE PGA

01:14:00.369 --> 01:14:01.470
ALSO TALKING ABOUT THE EXACT

01:14:01.537 --> 01:14:04.706
SAME THING. AND SO THE QUESTION

01:14:04.773 --> 01:14:10.245
REALLY IS HOW DO WE GO ABOUT

01:14:10.312 --> 01:14:11.580
ADDRESSING THEM? YOU KNOW, AND

01:14:11.647 --> 01:14:13.015
SO THE POINT OF 540 WITH THE

01:14:13.081 --> 01:14:14.950
REGIONAL GRID THAT I'M SURE THAT

01:14:15.017 --> 01:14:17.052
WE'LL HAVE THE CHANCE TO TALK

01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:17.753
ABOUT EVENTUALLY IS FOR THOSE 45

01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:19.488
HOURS A YEAR, WE WANT TO BE ABLE

01:14:19.555 --> 01:14:21.323
TO TRADE. WE WANT TO GET

01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:22.858
GEOTHERMAL FROM THE SOUTH AND

01:14:22.925 --> 01:14:24.726
WIND AND SOLAR FROM THE EAST AND

01:14:24.793 --> 01:14:25.928
HYDRO FROM THE NORTH, AND CREATE

01:14:25.994 --> 01:14:27.596
THAT IN A MORE SEAMLESS WAY. THE

01:14:27.663 --> 01:14:29.598
OTHER PART IS TO REDUCE THE PEAK

01:14:29.665 --> 01:14:31.934
RIGHT CALL LOAD FLEXIBILITY. AND

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:32.935
THAT'S NOT ALWAYS, YOU KNOW,

01:14:33.001 --> 01:14:34.436
LOAD FLEXIBILITY IS NOT ALWAYS

01:14:34.503 --> 01:14:37.506
THE MOST SEXY TOPIC IN ENERGY,

01:14:37.573 --> 01:14:38.907
BUT IT'S REALLY THAT NOTION,

01:14:38.974 --> 01:14:40.442
RIGHT? HOW DO WE BRING DOWN THE

01:14:40.509 --> 01:14:41.910
PEAK, THOSE 45 HOURS A YEAR

01:14:41.977 --> 01:14:43.779
OTHER THAN SENDING YOU KNOW, WE

01:14:43.846 --> 01:14:45.714
HAD THAT THOSE OF THOSE TIMES A

01:14:45.781 --> 01:14:48.250
FEW YEARS AGO WHEN WE SENT OUT A

01:14:48.317 --> 01:14:49.751
MASSIVE ALERT, YOU KNOW, TO

01:14:49.818 --> 01:14:50.686
EVERYBODY'S CELL PHONE, STOP

01:14:50.752 --> 01:14:52.521
USING ENERGY. STOP. YOU KNOW,

01:14:52.588 --> 01:14:53.922
AND IT ACTUALLY WORKED. BUT

01:14:53.989 --> 01:14:55.591
OBVIOUSLY WE CAN'T WE CAN'T DO

01:14:55.657 --> 01:14:57.659
THAT TOO OFTEN. WE DON'T WANT TO

01:14:57.726 --> 01:14:59.561
RELY ON THAT. SO THIS BILL IS

01:14:59.628 --> 01:15:00.929
REALLY ABOUT THAT. OTHER PART IS

01:15:00.996 --> 01:15:02.698
HOW DO WE SHAVE THE PEAK AND HOW

01:15:02.764 --> 01:15:04.800
DO WE GET THE INFORMATION EVEN

01:15:04.867 --> 01:15:09.238
NECESSARY TO DO THAT. SO AGAIN,

01:15:09.304 --> 01:15:10.806
I WANT TO SAY UP FRONT I'LL BE

01:15:10.873 --> 01:15:12.541
ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE'S

01:15:12.608 --> 01:15:15.644
AMENDMENTS. THANK THE STAFF. AND

01:15:15.711 --> 01:15:17.246
WORKING WITH MANY STAKEHOLDERS,

01:15:17.312 --> 01:15:20.282
MANY ALLIES IN MANY CASES WHO,

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:21.450
YOU KNOW, JUST TRYING TO

01:15:21.516 --> 01:15:22.885
UNDERSTAND HOW THIS IS GOING TO

01:15:22.951 --> 01:15:23.886
WORK. AND AGAIN, WE ONLY STARTED

01:15:23.952 --> 01:15:25.921
WRITING THIS BILL THIS YEAR. SO

01:15:25.988 --> 01:15:28.323
WE'VE BEEN IT'S BEEN A BIT OF A

01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:30.292
WORK IN PROGRESS, BUT I REALLY

01:15:30.359 --> 01:15:32.294
APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S WORK. SO

01:15:32.361 --> 01:15:34.196
THE FIRST PART OF BILL IS REALLY

01:15:34.263 --> 01:15:35.197
A TRANSPARENCY MEASURE TO SEE

01:15:35.264 --> 01:15:37.266
HOW MUCH PROGRESS WE ARE MAKING

01:15:37.332 --> 01:15:38.734
TOWARDS THE GOAL THAT WE HAVE AS

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:41.203
A STATE. THE GOALS OF SEVEN

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:43.338
GIGAWATTS, 7000MW OF LOAD

01:15:43.405 --> 01:15:46.808
SHIFTING BY 2030. AND SO IT ASKS

01:15:46.875 --> 01:15:48.010
YOU TO ESTIMATE HOW MUCH

01:15:48.076 --> 01:15:50.112
POTENTIAL EACH UTILITY OR CCA

01:15:50.178 --> 01:15:52.347
HAS FOR COST EFFECTIVE LOAD

01:15:52.414 --> 01:15:53.548
SHIFTING AND HOW MUCH OF THAT

01:15:53.615 --> 01:15:55.217
THEY HAVE CAPTURED SO FAR IN

01:15:55.284 --> 01:15:56.852
THEIR NEAR TERM PLANS. AGAIN,

01:15:56.919 --> 01:15:58.887
THE GOAL IS NOT TO. IT'S JUST TO

01:15:58.954 --> 01:16:00.589
WORK WITH PEOPLE TO SEE WHAT'S

01:16:00.656 --> 01:16:01.723
BEING DONE EFFECTIVELY AND HOW

01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:04.226
EVERYONE CAN DO IT. HELP US

01:16:04.293 --> 01:16:05.994
UNDERSTAND BEST PRACTICE AND

01:16:06.061 --> 01:16:07.496
HELP US IDENTIFY BARRIERS AND

01:16:07.562 --> 01:16:09.197
GET A BETTER SENSE OF HOW

01:16:09.264 --> 01:16:10.666
ACHIEVABLE THE GOAL IS. SO I

01:16:10.732 --> 01:16:12.434
JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THIS IS

01:16:12.501 --> 01:16:13.802
REALLY A TRANSPARENCY MEASURE.

01:16:13.869 --> 01:16:14.536
THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT

01:16:14.603 --> 01:16:15.871
MANDATE. WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO

01:16:15.938 --> 01:16:17.572
OUR FRIENDS AT THE PWS, THE

01:16:17.639 --> 01:16:19.007
CCAS. THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT

01:16:19.074 --> 01:16:20.342
MANDATE. THERE'S NOTHING OF THAT

01:16:20.409 --> 01:16:21.910
IN ANY KIND. IT'S NOT AIMED AT

01:16:21.977 --> 01:16:23.645
THAT. IT'S REALLY A TRANSPARENCY

01:16:23.712 --> 01:16:25.314
MEASURE. THE SECOND PART OF THE

01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:26.381
BILL IS FOCUSED ON TAKING

01:16:26.448 --> 01:16:29.151
ADVANTAGE OF LOAD FLEXIBILITY AT

01:16:29.217 --> 01:16:30.919
THE DISTRIBUTION LEVEL TO

01:16:30.986 --> 01:16:32.087
INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF DEMAND

01:16:32.154 --> 01:16:33.822
THAT CAN BE MET WITH OUR

01:16:33.889 --> 01:16:34.423
EXISTING SUBSTATIONS AND OTHER

01:16:34.489 --> 01:16:36.391
POLES AND WIRE INFRASTRUCTURE,

01:16:36.458 --> 01:16:38.026
WHERE IT'S COST EFFECTIVE TO DO

01:16:38.093 --> 01:16:39.728
SO. SO, SO FAR, LOAD FLEXIBILITY

01:16:39.795 --> 01:16:42.030
HAS BEEN USUALLY DONE AT SYSTEM

01:16:42.097 --> 01:16:43.966
WIDE PEAK DEMAND. RIGHT? WE KIND

01:16:44.032 --> 01:16:47.769
OF GO OUT TO EVERYBODY. AND AS

01:16:47.836 --> 01:16:48.870
AN ALTERNATIVE TO BUILDING MORE

01:16:48.937 --> 01:16:50.939
POWER PLANTS FOR THOSE HOTTEST

01:16:51.006 --> 01:16:52.274
SUMMER EVENINGS, BUT VERY LITTLE

01:16:52.341 --> 01:16:53.909
HAS BEEN DONE TO REDUCE PEAK

01:16:53.976 --> 01:16:56.111
DEMAND LOCALLY IN PLACES THAT

01:16:56.178 --> 01:16:57.412
HAVE DISTRIBUTION GRID

01:16:57.479 --> 01:16:59.081
CONSTRAINTS. BUT THAT WOULD BE A

01:16:59.147 --> 01:17:00.515
WAY TO AVOID SPENDING AS MUCH

01:17:00.582 --> 01:17:02.484
OVER THE COMING YEARS TO UPGRADE

01:17:02.551 --> 01:17:03.618
ALL THAT INFRASTRUCTURE TO MEET

01:17:03.685 --> 01:17:05.921
GROWING DEMAND. LOAD FLEXIBILITY

01:17:05.988 --> 01:17:07.456
CAN ALSO OPEN UP HEADROOM THAT

01:17:07.522 --> 01:17:09.091
WILL ALLOW NEW HOUSING, EV

01:17:09.157 --> 01:17:10.726
CHARGING DEPOTS, OTHER NEW

01:17:10.792 --> 01:17:12.594
CUSTOMER LOAD TO BE POWERED UP

01:17:12.661 --> 01:17:14.196
SOONER WITHOUT OVERLOADING THE

01:17:14.262 --> 01:17:15.297
DISTRIBUTION GRID. BECAUSE THE

01:17:15.364 --> 01:17:17.432
THING IS, WE DISCUSSED YESTERDAY

01:17:17.499 --> 01:17:19.134
WE HAVE VOLUMETRIC RATES, SO

01:17:19.201 --> 01:17:20.602
WE'RE TRYING TO GET MORE LOAD ON

01:17:20.669 --> 01:17:22.804
THE GRID. THAT'S GOING TO BRING

01:17:22.871 --> 01:17:23.739
DOWN COSTS FOR EVERYONE. BUT

01:17:23.805 --> 01:17:25.407
RIGHT NOW WE DON'T REALLY KNOW

01:17:25.474 --> 01:17:26.842
WHERE TO BRING. WHERE'S THE BEST

01:17:26.908 --> 01:17:29.044
PLACES TO BRING THAT NEW LOAD

01:17:29.111 --> 01:17:31.380
ONLINE. SO THE SECOND PART OF

01:17:31.446 --> 01:17:32.948
THE BILL DIRECTS THE CPUC TO

01:17:33.015 --> 01:17:34.616
DEVELOP A STRATEGY FOR CAPTURING

01:17:34.683 --> 01:17:36.451
THOSE COST SAVINGS VIA LOW

01:17:36.518 --> 01:17:37.753
FLEXIBILITY, WHERE IT'S COST

01:17:37.819 --> 01:17:38.887
EFFECTIVE, IT HAS SOME

01:17:38.954 --> 01:17:40.088
REQUIREMENTS, FOR EXAMPLE, FOR

01:17:40.155 --> 01:17:41.757
IOUS TO PROVIDE MORE DATA TO

01:17:41.823 --> 01:17:42.557
UNDERSTAND WHERE THE

01:17:42.624 --> 01:17:43.658
OPPORTUNITIES ARE, AND FOR US TO

01:17:43.725 --> 01:17:45.293
TAKE EXISTING LOAD FLEXIBILITY

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:46.495
INTO ACCOUNT DURING THE ANNUAL

01:17:46.561 --> 01:17:48.330
DISTRIBUTION PLANNING PROCESS.

01:17:48.397 --> 01:17:49.398
IF WE CAN DELIVER MORE

01:17:49.464 --> 01:17:50.832
ELECTRICITY THROUGH THE WIRES WE

01:17:50.899 --> 01:17:52.300
ALREADY HAVE, BY SHIFTING DEMAND

01:17:52.367 --> 01:17:53.635
AWAY FROM THOSE FEW PEAK HOURS A

01:17:53.702 --> 01:17:55.470
YEAR, THEN WE CAN SUPPORT NEW

01:17:55.537 --> 01:17:57.172
LOADS, HOUSING, DATA CENTERS,

01:17:57.239 --> 01:17:58.607
WHATEVER FASTER, WHILE ALSO

01:17:58.673 --> 01:18:00.876
LOWERING RATES. WITH ME, I'VE

01:18:00.942 --> 01:18:02.744
RYAN HADLOCK FROM PRINCIPAL. THE

01:18:02.811 --> 01:18:04.479
BRATTLE GROUP HAS LED MANY

01:18:04.546 --> 01:18:05.647
STUDIES LOOKING AT THE ECONOMIC

01:18:05.714 --> 01:18:07.182
BENEFITS OF THIS. THANK YOU.

CONSULTING FIRM. FOR THE PAST 18

01:18:13.021 --> 01:18:14.756
YEARS, MY RESEARCH HAS FOCUSED

01:18:14.823 --> 01:18:16.058
ON OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE THE

01:18:16.124 --> 01:18:18.026
POWER SYSTEM BY INCENTIVIZING

01:18:18.093 --> 01:18:19.294
HOUSEHOLDS AND BUSINESSES TO

01:18:19.361 --> 01:18:20.729
BECOME MORE FLEXIBLE CONSUMERS

01:18:20.796 --> 01:18:22.964
OF ELECTRICITY. MY RESEARCH ON

01:18:23.031 --> 01:18:24.599
LOAD FLEXIBILITY HAS BEEN CITED

01:18:24.666 --> 01:18:26.768
IN FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORY

01:18:26.835 --> 01:18:27.602
DECISIONS PUBLISHED IN PEER

01:18:27.669 --> 01:18:28.937
REVIEWED ACADEMIC JOURNALS AND

01:18:29.004 --> 01:18:30.372
COVERED BY THE MAJOR NATIONAL

01:18:30.439 --> 01:18:32.441
MEDIA OUTLETS. A STUDY THAT I

01:18:32.507 --> 01:18:33.775
LED LAST YEAR FOUND THAT THERE

01:18:33.842 --> 01:18:36.144
IS MORE THAN 7000MW OF COST

01:18:36.211 --> 01:18:37.512
EFFECTIVE, ACHIEVABLE LOAD

01:18:37.579 --> 01:18:39.281
FLEXIBILITY POTENTIAL IN

01:18:39.347 --> 01:18:41.183
CALIFORNIA. THAT'S ROUGHLY THE

01:18:41.249 --> 01:18:42.584
CAPACITY OF THREE DIABLO

01:18:42.651 --> 01:18:44.753
CANYONS. IF DEVELOPED, THAT

01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:46.521
CAPABILITY COULD SAVE CALIFORNIA

01:18:46.588 --> 01:18:48.123
HOUSEHOLDS MORE THAN HALF $1

01:18:48.190 --> 01:18:50.092
BILLION PER YEAR. PARTICIPANTS

01:18:50.158 --> 01:18:51.193
IN LOAD FLEXIBILITY PROGRAMS

01:18:51.259 --> 01:18:52.727
WOULD BE COMPENSATED FOR THE

01:18:52.794 --> 01:18:53.762
SERVICES THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING

01:18:53.829 --> 01:18:55.964
TO THE GRID, AND NON

01:18:56.031 --> 01:18:57.399
PARTICIPANTS ARE. ALL

01:18:57.466 --> 01:18:58.433
CALIFORNIANS WOULD BENEFIT FROM

01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:00.035
A REDUCTION IN THE OVERALL COST

01:19:00.102 --> 01:19:01.403
OF MEETING THE STATE'S ENERGY

01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:03.605
NEEDS. SB 541 IS AN IMPORTANT

01:19:03.672 --> 01:19:05.807
STEP FORWARD IN THIS REGARD.

01:19:05.874 --> 01:19:07.742
FIRST, AS SENATOR BECKER NOTED,

01:19:07.809 --> 01:19:09.211
ITS DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

01:19:09.277 --> 01:19:11.413
CREATE GREATER TRANSPARENCY

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:12.581
AROUND THE STATE'S PROGRESS

01:19:12.647 --> 01:19:13.448
TOWARD ACHIEVING ITS LOAD

01:19:13.515 --> 01:19:15.750
FLEXIBILITY POTENTIAL. WITH THAT

01:19:15.817 --> 01:19:16.818
INFORMATION, WE'LL HAVE A BETTER

01:19:16.885 --> 01:19:18.086
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S WORKING,

01:19:18.153 --> 01:19:20.856
WHAT ISN'T, AND HOW TO FIX IT.

01:19:20.922 --> 01:19:21.623
SECOND, THE BILL WILL ADDRESS

01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:23.325
CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS ON THE

01:19:23.391 --> 01:19:25.827
DISTRIBUTION GRID. IN THE PAST,

01:19:25.894 --> 01:19:27.062
ATTEMPTS TO USE LOAD FLEXIBILITY

01:19:27.129 --> 01:19:28.530
AS A DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM

01:19:28.597 --> 01:19:30.465
RESOURCE HAVE HAD SOME LIMITED

01:19:30.532 --> 01:19:33.768
SUCCESS. BUT SB 541 IS DIFFERENT

01:19:33.835 --> 01:19:35.437
RELATIVE TO THOSE PAST EFFORTS.

01:19:35.504 --> 01:19:36.938
THE BILL REQUIRES THAT LOAD

01:19:37.005 --> 01:19:38.039
FLEXIBILITY OPPORTUNITIES BE

01:19:38.106 --> 01:19:39.875
CONSIDERED EARLIER AND MORE

01:19:39.941 --> 01:19:40.976
COMPREHENSIVELY IN DISTRIBUTION

01:19:41.042 --> 01:19:43.445
PLANNING. IF SUCCESSFUL, NEW

01:19:43.512 --> 01:19:44.679
CUSTOMERS WOULD BE CONNECTED TO

01:19:44.746 --> 01:19:47.082
THE GRID BOTH FASTER AND AT A

01:19:47.149 --> 01:19:48.483
LOWER COST. THUS, CUSTOMERS

01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:49.718
COULD BE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS,

01:19:49.784 --> 01:19:51.753
EV CHARGING HUBS, ADVANCED

01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:53.155
MANUFACTURING OR DATA CENTERS,

01:19:53.221 --> 01:19:54.956
FOR EXAMPLE. SO AS WE LOOK

01:19:55.023 --> 01:19:56.391
FORWARD, CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS

01:19:56.458 --> 01:19:57.926
WILL CONTINUE TO PAIR BATTERIES

01:19:57.993 --> 01:19:59.995
WITH ROOFTOP SOLAR. THEY'LL

01:20:00.061 --> 01:20:01.396
PURCHASE ELECTRIC VEHICLES,

01:20:01.463 --> 01:20:02.864
EFFICIENT ELECTRIC APPLIANCES

01:20:02.931 --> 01:20:04.466
AND GAIN BETTER ACCESS TO

01:20:04.533 --> 01:20:05.867
INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR ENERGY

01:20:05.934 --> 01:20:08.670
USE. SIMPLY PUT, SB 541 WILL

01:20:08.737 --> 01:20:10.071
ENHANCE THE VALUE OF THOSE

01:20:10.138 --> 01:20:11.907
TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE BENEFIT OF

01:20:11.973 --> 01:20:12.974
ALL CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU FOR

01:20:13.041 --> 01:20:14.776

541. THANK YOU. OPENING UP TO

01:20:29.858 --> 01:20:31.459
THAT HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTED IN THE

PAST. I WANT TO THANK YOUR STAFF

MOVED QUITE A WAY. THERE'S STILL

APPRECIATE OUR EXTENSIVE

DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHOR TO

01:21:50.071 --> 01:21:52.474
GET TO THE BILL TO PLACE THAT IT

01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:54.843

THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY CHOICE

ASSOCIATION AND ITS 24 ACTIVE

01:22:18.199 --> 01:22:19.167
MEMBERS, WE HAVE AN OPPOSE

01:22:19.234 --> 01:22:20.435
UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE

01:22:20.502 --> 01:22:23.638
ON THE BILL IN PRINT. THE

01:22:23.705 --> 01:22:25.040
ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT

01:22:25.106 --> 01:22:26.041
DIVIDING THE GOAL FOR LOAD

01:22:26.107 --> 01:22:29.144
SHIFTING AMONG INDIVIDUAL LSIS

01:22:29.210 --> 01:22:30.645
IMPLIES A MANDATE IS IN CONFLICT

01:22:30.712 --> 01:22:32.981
WITH THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL

01:22:33.048 --> 01:22:34.382
THAT STATES THAT IT IS NOT A

01:22:34.449 --> 01:22:34.983
PROCUREMENT MANDATE, AND WE

01:22:35.050 --> 01:22:35.817
AGREE WITH THAT ASSESSMENT IN.

01:22:35.884 --> 01:22:38.720
OUR PRIMARY CONCERN IS THAT, YOU

01:22:38.787 --> 01:22:42.290
KNOW, THAT THAT THE THAT

01:22:42.357 --> 01:22:44.693
ESSENTIALLY, WHILE OUR MEMBERS

01:22:44.759 --> 01:22:46.461
ARE ALWAYS READY TO DECARBONIZE,

01:22:46.528 --> 01:22:48.129
AND IN FACT, IT'S FAIRLY

01:22:48.196 --> 01:22:49.864
EMBEDDED WITHIN THE DNA OF THE

01:22:49.931 --> 01:22:52.667
CCA MOVEMENT. AND WHILE SOME OF

01:22:52.734 --> 01:22:53.802
OUR MEMBERS, IN FACT, AS NOTED

01:22:53.868 --> 01:22:55.203
IN THE ANALYSIS, HAVE ACTUALLY

01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:56.738
ALREADY MADE SIGNIFICANT

01:22:56.805 --> 01:22:58.173
INVESTMENTS IN LOAD REDUCTION

01:22:58.239 --> 01:23:00.342
AND SHIFTING, PRIMARILY THE

01:23:00.408 --> 01:23:01.476
EXAMPLE IN THE ANALYSIS ON PAGE

01:23:01.543 --> 01:23:03.078
SEVEN, THE AG FIT PROGRAM, WHICH

01:23:03.144 --> 01:23:05.046
IS BEING OPERATED BY VALLEY

01:23:05.113 --> 01:23:05.947
CLEAN ENERGY JUST DOWN THE ROAD

01:23:06.014 --> 01:23:09.484
FROM US TODAY. THE REALITY IS

01:23:09.551 --> 01:23:11.619
THAT THERE CAN BE SOME SERIOUS

01:23:11.686 --> 01:23:13.355
COST EFFECTIVENESS ISSUES WITH

01:23:13.421 --> 01:23:16.124
LOAD SHIFTING STRATEGIES. AND SO

01:23:16.191 --> 01:23:17.859
WE BELIEVE THAT ANY MANDATE IN

01:23:17.926 --> 01:23:20.095
THIS REGARD WOULD BE INCREDIBLY

01:23:20.161 --> 01:23:21.229
PREMATURE, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT

01:23:21.296 --> 01:23:24.165
THE CPUC AND THE CSP ARE ALREADY

01:23:24.232 --> 01:23:25.900
DOING EXTENSIVE WORK ON THAT

01:23:25.967 --> 01:23:27.369
ISSUE AND WILL BE CONTINUING TO

01:23:27.435 --> 01:23:28.636
ANALYZE HOW THOSE THOSE ISSUES

01:23:28.703 --> 01:23:30.872
COULD BE OR HOW THOSE STRATEGIES

01:23:30.939 --> 01:23:33.041
COULD BE DEPLOYED. AND SO, ALL

01:23:33.108 --> 01:23:35.276
OF THAT SAID, WE VERY MUCH

01:23:35.343 --> 01:23:36.244
APPRECIATE THAT THE STAFF'S

01:23:36.311 --> 01:23:38.012
ANALYSIS RAISES THESE ISSUES AND

01:23:38.079 --> 01:23:39.714
WAS THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THEM. WE

01:23:39.781 --> 01:23:40.949
REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO REVIEWING

01:23:41.015 --> 01:23:42.417
THE AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL ONCE

01:23:42.484 --> 01:23:45.086
THOSE ARE IN PRINT. AND WE HOPE

01:23:45.153 --> 01:23:47.188
THAT THAT RESOLVES SOME OF OUR

01:23:47.255 --> 01:23:51.126
CONCERNS. THANK YOU. GOOD

01:23:51.192 --> 01:23:53.461
AFTERNOON, MADAM CHAIR. MEMBERS

01:23:53.528 --> 01:23:54.729
OF THE COMMITTEE, VALERIE CHIRLA

01:23:54.796 --> 01:23:56.765
ALEJO'S WITH PACIFIC GAS AND

01:23:56.831 --> 01:23:58.833
ELECTRIC COMPANY, TESTIFYING

01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:01.436
WITH AN OPPOSE, UNLESS AMENDED

01:24:01.503 --> 01:24:03.838
POSITION, I GUESS WANT TO START

01:24:03.905 --> 01:24:06.908
OFF WITH JUST, YOU KNOW, SOME

01:24:06.975 --> 01:24:07.709
COMMONALITIES AND SHARED GOALS

01:24:07.776 --> 01:24:10.578
THAT WE HAVE WITH WITH WHAT THE

01:24:10.645 --> 01:24:13.348
AUTHOR IS TRYING TO DO AND A LOT

01:24:13.415 --> 01:24:15.550
OF THE VERY IN-DEPTH

01:24:15.617 --> 01:24:17.385
CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD,

01:24:17.452 --> 01:24:20.155
GOOD ONES WITH HIS STAFF HAVE

01:24:20.221 --> 01:24:22.056
FOCUSED ON, YOU KNOW, THE

01:24:22.123 --> 01:24:24.526
COMPLEXITY OF THE ENGINEERING

01:24:24.592 --> 01:24:25.960
INVOLVED, OUR SHARED GOALS AND

01:24:26.027 --> 01:24:28.863
THE DESIRE TO MOVE SOMETHING

01:24:28.930 --> 01:24:31.032
FORWARD THAT IS NOT TOO

01:24:31.099 --> 01:24:35.303
PRESCRIPTIVE, BUT HAS HAS SOME

01:24:35.370 --> 01:24:37.806
LANGUAGE THAT CAN CAN DRIVE A

01:24:37.872 --> 01:24:41.176
STRATEGY FORWARD AT THE

01:24:41.242 --> 01:24:43.611
COMMISSION THAT, YOU KNOW,

01:24:43.678 --> 01:24:45.447
ACHIEVES OUR GOALS COST

01:24:45.513 --> 01:24:49.384
EFFECTIVELY, FEASIBLY. SO SOME

01:24:49.451 --> 01:24:51.119
OF THE SPECIFIC THINGS THAT I

01:24:51.186 --> 01:24:52.787
GUESS I'LL GIVE A FEW EXAMPLES

01:24:52.854 --> 01:24:54.322
OF THAT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT

01:24:54.389 --> 01:24:56.891
IS SOME OF THE INCENTIVES FOR

01:24:56.958 --> 01:24:59.160
THESE RESOURCES. THIS SEEMS LIKE

01:24:59.227 --> 01:25:03.097
A SEMANTIC TYPE OF LANGUAGE, BUT

01:25:03.164 --> 01:25:04.866
LEVERAGING THE RESOURCES IN OUR

01:25:04.933 --> 01:25:07.001
PLANNING PROCESS AND OUR VERY

01:25:07.068 --> 01:25:08.636
IN-DEPTH PROCESS IS DIFFERENT

01:25:08.703 --> 01:25:12.106
THAN INCENTIVIZING. ALSO, YOU

01:25:12.173 --> 01:25:13.541
KNOW, WE APPRECIATE THE

01:25:13.608 --> 01:25:16.778
COMMITTEE'S RECOGNITION THAT WE

01:25:16.845 --> 01:25:18.880
TAKE LEARNINGS FROM A PAST

01:25:18.947 --> 01:25:20.748
PROGRAM WITH THE AWESOME ACRONYM

01:25:20.815 --> 01:25:23.184
OF DID.IF, THE DISTRIBUTION

01:25:23.251 --> 01:25:25.386
INVESTMENT DEFERRAL FRAMEWORK.

01:25:25.453 --> 01:25:26.688
SO IT'S GOOD THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:25:26.754 --> 01:25:28.990
LEARN FROM THAT, BECAUSE THAT

01:25:29.057 --> 01:25:30.792
THAT WASN'T SUPER SUCCESSFUL.

01:25:30.859 --> 01:25:32.994
AND, YOU KNOW, WE WITH THE

01:25:33.061 --> 01:25:33.995
COMMISSION, THE STATE PUT THAT

01:25:34.062 --> 01:25:38.099

01:25:38.166 --> 01:25:41.302
SEE THE AMENDMENTS. AND LIKE I

01:25:41.369 --> 01:25:44.539
SAID, WE THE CURRENT WE HOPE

01:25:44.606 --> 01:25:47.008

FROM PGE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

01:27:34.349 --> 01:27:35.450
BEFORE WE OPEN IT UP FOR

01:27:35.516 --> 01:27:36.918
QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS FROM

01:27:36.985 --> 01:27:37.552
COMMITTEE MEMBERS, LET ME JUST

01:27:37.619 --> 01:27:39.787
DO A QUICK STEP THROUGH OF SOME

01:27:39.854 --> 01:27:41.522
OF THE KEY PROVISIONS OF THE

01:27:41.589 --> 01:27:44.792
AMENDMENTS. SO THE AMENDMENTS DO

01:27:44.859 --> 01:27:46.728
KIND OF THREE PRIMARY THINGS.

01:27:46.794 --> 01:27:47.929
NUMBER ONE, STRIKE THE LANGUAGE

01:27:47.996 --> 01:27:49.831
THAT DIVIDE THE CÁC LOAD SHIFT

01:27:49.897 --> 01:27:51.899
GOAL AMONG RETAIL SUPPLIERS.

01:27:51.966 --> 01:27:53.635
NUMBER TWO INCORPORATES COST

01:27:53.701 --> 01:27:54.802
EFFECTIVENESS LANGUAGE INTO THE

01:27:54.869 --> 01:27:55.970
ASSESSMENT OF LOAD SHIFTING

01:27:56.037 --> 01:27:56.938
PROGRAMS BEING EVALUATED AND

01:27:57.005 --> 01:27:59.440
ENACTED BY THE STATE. AND NUMBER

01:27:59.507 --> 01:28:00.608
THREE SPECIFIES THE INTENT TO

01:28:00.675 --> 01:28:02.410
APPLY LESSONS LEARNED FROM PAST

01:28:02.477 --> 01:28:06.280
EFFORTS. SO I DO THINK THAT

01:28:06.347 --> 01:28:07.382
PERHAPS WE'LL HAVE A DIFFERENT

01:28:07.448 --> 01:28:09.450
CONVERSATION ONCE YOU ALL ARE

01:28:09.517 --> 01:28:10.718
ABLE TO REVIEW THE AMENDMENTS IN

01:28:10.785 --> 01:28:12.754
SOME DETAIL AND APPRECIATE THE

01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:14.589
AUTHORS ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR WITH

01:28:14.656 --> 01:28:15.657
OUR COMMITTEE STAFF AS WE

01:28:15.723 --> 01:28:18.426
ADVANCED THOSE QUESTIONS OR

01:28:18.493 --> 01:28:19.527
COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

01:28:19.594 --> 01:28:22.597
OKAY. QUESTION FROM ASSEMBLY

01:28:22.664 --> 01:28:24.699
MEMBER ERWIN, I JUST WILL MAKE A

01:28:24.766 --> 01:28:26.167
QUICK COMMENT BECAUSE YOU SAID

01:28:26.234 --> 01:28:28.269
LOAD SHIFTING WASN'T VERY SEXY,

01:28:28.336 --> 01:28:30.538
BUT THIS IS ONE OF THE TOPICS

01:28:30.605 --> 01:28:32.340
THAT I HAVE REALLY BEEN PUSHING

01:28:32.407 --> 01:28:33.708
ON OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS

01:28:33.775 --> 01:28:35.810
BECAUSE I THINK IT INCREASES

01:28:35.877 --> 01:28:38.413
GRID RESILIENCY. IT COULD

01:28:38.479 --> 01:28:40.915
POTENTIALLY DECREASE DECREASE

01:28:40.982 --> 01:28:43.017
COSTS, AND IT DOESN'T REQUIRE US

01:28:43.084 --> 01:28:44.552
TO EXPAND OUR GRID AS FAST. SO

01:28:44.619 --> 01:28:46.988
IF IT'S DONE THE RIGHT WAY, I, I

01:28:47.055 --> 01:28:50.692
THINK THIS IS GREAT POLICY. I, I

01:28:50.758 --> 01:28:51.893
GUESS I DIDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND

01:28:51.959 --> 01:28:53.461
THE FIRST AMENDMENT A LOT. WE'VE

01:28:53.528 --> 01:28:55.630
WE HAD A LOT OF THE PWS COMING

01:28:55.697 --> 01:28:57.832
TO THE OFFICE. WHAT IS WHAT IS

01:28:57.899 --> 01:28:59.434
YOUR THOUGHT ON THEIR OPPOSITION

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:01.269
THAT THEY ARE DOING A LOT OF

01:29:01.335 --> 01:29:03.304
THIS THEMSELVES ALREADY? WELL, I

01:29:03.371 --> 01:29:04.672
THINK, AND THANK YOU. YOU HAD

01:29:04.739 --> 01:29:06.074
YOUR BILL UP IN OUR COMMITTEE

01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:07.575
TOO ALONG THESE LINES. SO I

01:29:07.642 --> 01:29:10.645
APPRECIATE YOUR WORK IN THIS.

01:29:10.712 --> 01:29:12.980
THE I THINK THE QUESTION IS SORT

01:29:13.047 --> 01:29:15.383
OF THE GRANULARITY. SO I THINK

01:29:15.450 --> 01:29:16.384
THERE WAS ONE SUGGESTION THAT WE

01:29:16.451 --> 01:29:18.252
JUST LOOK OVERALL BY TYPE, LIKE

01:29:18.319 --> 01:29:20.054
HOW MUCH ARE CCA IS DOING VERSUS

01:29:20.121 --> 01:29:22.690
HOW MUCH ARE AND THAT WOULDN'T

01:29:22.757 --> 01:29:24.425
GET TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE

01:29:24.492 --> 01:29:25.827
BECAUSE IT JUST IT WOULDN'T

01:29:25.893 --> 01:29:28.396
REALLY TELL US ANYTHING. SO WE

01:29:28.463 --> 01:29:29.964
ARE TRYING TO KIND OF GET THAT,

01:29:30.031 --> 01:29:34.936
THAT THAT GRANULAR DATA, THE I

01:29:35.002 --> 01:29:36.804
JUST, YOU KNOW, I DID WANT TO

01:29:36.871 --> 01:29:38.973
POINT OUT AND I KNOW AGAIN,

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:40.842
WE'RE WE'RE HAPPY TO KEEP THESE

01:29:40.908 --> 01:29:41.743
CONVERSATIONS WITH, WITH PEOPLE

01:29:41.809 --> 01:29:44.145
THAT WE REGULARLY ALIGN ON. BUT

01:29:44.212 --> 01:29:47.482
IT DOES SAY SPECIFICALLY IN THE

01:29:47.548 --> 01:29:52.587
BILL THAT. THIS SECTION DOES NOT

01:29:52.653 --> 01:29:53.788
IMPOSE A BINDING OBLIGATION OR

01:29:53.855 --> 01:29:54.689
OTHERWISE MANDATE THE

01:29:54.756 --> 01:29:55.456
PROCUREMENT OF LOAD SHIFTING

01:29:55.523 --> 01:29:56.824
TECHNOLOGIES BY RETAIL

01:29:56.891 --> 01:29:58.292
SUPPLIERS. THE SECTION IS NOT

01:29:58.359 --> 01:29:59.994
INTENDED TO BRIDGE OR OTHERWISE

01:30:00.061 --> 01:30:00.595
SUPPLANT THE AUTHORITY OF THE

01:30:00.661 --> 01:30:01.763
GOVERNING BOARDS OF COMMUNITY

01:30:01.829 --> 01:30:02.930
CHOICE, AGGREGATION OR LOCAL

01:30:02.997 --> 01:30:03.831
PUBLIC ENTITIES TO SET RATES,

01:30:03.898 --> 01:30:05.600
ESTABLISH PROGRAMS AND CREATE

01:30:05.666 --> 01:30:06.634
GOALS. SO WE'RE TRYING TO BE

01:30:06.701 --> 01:30:07.835
PRETTY CLEAR ON IT, OBVIOUSLY.

01:30:07.902 --> 01:30:09.537
MAYBE NOT CLEAR ENOUGH STILL FOR

01:30:09.604 --> 01:30:10.505
FOLKS, BUT I THINK THAT'S

01:30:10.571 --> 01:30:12.840
SOMETHING WE CAN WORK ON, I

01:30:12.907 --> 01:30:14.075
HOPE. THANK YOU, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:30:14.142 --> 01:30:15.009
GARABEDIAN. THANK YOU, MADAM

01:30:15.076 --> 01:30:16.677
CHAIR. THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR

01:30:16.744 --> 01:30:18.479
FOR BEING HERE. I THINK IT'S A

01:30:18.546 --> 01:30:19.914
IMPORTANT BILL. OBVIOUSLY, I

01:30:19.981 --> 01:30:21.048
THINK THE INTENT AND WHAT YOU'RE

01:30:21.115 --> 01:30:21.916
TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IS

01:30:21.983 --> 01:30:23.851
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. MY ONLY

01:30:23.918 --> 01:30:25.686
QUESTION IS. AND HAPPY TO

01:30:25.753 --> 01:30:27.421
SUPPORT IT TODAY, HOW IS THIS

01:30:27.488 --> 01:30:30.758
AFFECTING BEHIND THE METER? DER

01:30:30.825 --> 01:30:31.359
INCENTIVIZATION. OBVIOUSLY, I

01:30:31.425 --> 01:30:33.694
JUST HAD A BILL IN FRONT OF YOUR

01:30:33.761 --> 01:30:35.396
COMMITTEE THAT GOT OUT ABOUT

01:30:35.463 --> 01:30:36.030
VIRTUAL POWER PLANT AGGREGATORS

01:30:36.097 --> 01:30:37.865
AND HOW WE CAN KIND OF DO MORE

01:30:37.932 --> 01:30:40.168
WITH THOSE. IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME

01:30:40.234 --> 01:30:40.701
WHETHER THAT'S JUST

01:30:40.768 --> 01:30:41.569
COMPLIMENTARY WITH THIS BILL OR

01:30:41.636 --> 01:30:43.171
WHETHER IT INCORPORATES IT. AND

01:30:43.237 --> 01:30:44.739
SOME OF THE DEFINITIONS AREN'T

01:30:44.806 --> 01:30:46.007
LIKE RETAIL SUPPLIER. I DON'T

01:30:46.073 --> 01:30:49.443
THINK WOULD INCLUDE A VPP

01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:51.512
AGGREGATOR. RIGHT. SO HOW DO YOU

01:30:51.579 --> 01:30:52.647
ENVISION THOSE TWO THINGS

01:30:52.713 --> 01:30:53.714
WORKING TOGETHER BEHIND THE

01:30:53.781 --> 01:30:55.883
METER DER AND THIS BILL AND

01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:58.553
TRYING TO INCENTIVIZE MORE

01:30:58.619 --> 01:31:01.022
RELIANCE ON DER? YEAH, WELL, I

01:31:01.088 --> 01:31:02.290
DON'T SEE MY WITNESSES. ANY

01:31:02.356 --> 01:31:03.558
THOUGHTS ON THAT TO YOU? BUT

01:31:03.624 --> 01:31:05.693
VERY MUCH IN LINE. AND I WAS

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:06.694
SORRY I WAS RUNNING AROUND WHEN

01:31:06.761 --> 01:31:08.930
YOU PRESENTED YOUR BILL. I WOULD

01:31:08.996 --> 01:31:09.764
HAVE COMMENTED WITH THE WORK

01:31:09.831 --> 01:31:11.332
THAT YOU'RE DOING ON VIRTUAL

01:31:11.399 --> 01:31:12.600
POWER PLANTS, I THINK IT'S SUPER

01:31:12.667 --> 01:31:13.601
IMPORTANT, BILL. IT'S VERY

01:31:13.668 --> 01:31:15.369
COMPLEMENTARY WITH THIS BILL.

01:31:15.436 --> 01:31:16.470
VIRTUAL POWER PLANTS ARE NOT

01:31:16.537 --> 01:31:19.073
RETAIL SUPPLIERS. SO AGAIN, I

01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:20.908
JUST THINK I THINK THOSE EFFORTS

01:31:20.975 --> 01:31:23.644
ARE VERY COMPLEMENTARY WITH OUR

01:31:23.711 --> 01:31:26.180
EFFORTS HERE. YOU KNOW, PART OF

01:31:26.247 --> 01:31:27.582
THE IMPETUS WE THOUGHT ABOUT

01:31:27.648 --> 01:31:29.383
THIS IS, YOU KNOW, THERE'S I

01:31:29.450 --> 01:31:31.285
THINK WHAT IT'S LIKE SOMETHING

01:31:31.352 --> 01:31:31.786
LIKE SEVEN GIGAWATTS OR

01:31:31.853 --> 01:31:33.087
SOMETHING BEHIND THE METER. NOW

01:31:33.154 --> 01:31:34.422
BATTERIES THAT WERE NOT CALLING

01:31:34.488 --> 01:31:35.957
INTO PLAY, WE'RE NOT ASKING

01:31:36.023 --> 01:31:36.991
ANYTHING OF THEM DURING THESE

01:31:37.058 --> 01:31:39.427
PEAK TIMES. AND I KNOW THAT'S

01:31:39.493 --> 01:31:42.463
PARTLY WHAT YOUR BILL GETS AT.

01:31:42.530 --> 01:31:43.698
AND SO I THINK IT'S VERY

01:31:43.764 --> 01:31:45.533
COMPLEMENTARY. OKAY. THANK YOU.

01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:46.968
ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVIS, THANK

01:31:47.034 --> 01:31:49.303
YOU. I APPRECIATE THE BILL. AND

01:31:49.370 --> 01:31:50.671
I'M GOING TO BE STAYING WITH

01:31:50.738 --> 01:31:53.140
OPPOSITION RIGHT NOW AND LOOK

01:31:53.207 --> 01:31:54.108
FORWARD TO SEEING THE AMENDMENTS

01:44:10.777 --> 01:44:12.813
FORECASTED PREEMPTIVELY

01:44:12.879 --> 01:44:14.414
DE-ENERGIZING POWER LINES TO

REDUCE THE PROBABILITY OF THEM

01:44:16.249 --> 01:44:18.251
SPARKING AND CAUSING IGNITIONS.

01:44:18.318 --> 01:44:20.020
WHILE PSPS ADDRESSES THE

01:44:20.087 --> 01:44:22.556
IMMEDIATE RISK TO POWER

01:44:22.623 --> 01:44:23.590

01:44:23.657 --> 01:44:25.792

POPULATIONS WHO HEAVILY RELY ON

01:44:31.732 --> 01:44:34.701
THE AVAILABILITY OF ELECTRICITY.

01:44:34.768 --> 01:44:37.904
I HAD A SITUATION IN MY DISTRICT

01:44:37.971 --> 01:44:44.077
IN WHICH WE HAD A PSPS SHUT OFF

01:44:44.144 --> 01:44:47.347

01:44:47.414 --> 01:44:50.283
BILL IS IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO

01:44:50.350 --> 01:44:54.621
WHAT WE SAW IN THE HEART OF MY

01:44:54.688 --> 01:44:56.757

01:45:02.295 --> 01:45:04.231
SMALL BUSINESSES WERE ALSO

01:45:04.297 --> 01:45:07.134
IMPACTED. RESIDENTS VOICED THEIR

01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:08.702
CONCERNS OVER THE PERCEIVED LACK

01:45:08.769 --> 01:45:10.671
OF TIMELY AND ACCURATE

01:45:10.737 --> 01:45:11.705
COMMUNICATION FROM SOUTHERN

01:45:11.772 --> 01:45:13.206
CALIFORNIA EDISON, AND

01:45:13.273 --> 01:45:15.075
ULTIMATELY RESPONSE FROM LOCAL

01:45:15.142 --> 01:45:16.843
GOVERNMENT. AND UNFORTUNATELY,

01:45:16.910 --> 01:45:18.178
THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME OUR

01:45:18.245 --> 01:45:20.547
REGION HAS EXPERIENCED THOSE

01:45:20.614 --> 01:45:23.016
STORIES. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

01:45:23.083 --> 01:45:24.451
EDISON INITIALLY REFERRED

01:45:24.518 --> 01:45:25.652
RESIDENTS TO THEIR WEBSITE WITH

01:45:25.719 --> 01:45:28.722
A MAP OF PSPS SHUTOFFS. HOWEVER,

01:45:28.789 --> 01:45:29.990
MANY RESIDENTS NOTED THAT THE

01:45:30.057 --> 01:45:32.192
MAP DID NOT INCLUDE ALL OUTAGES.

01:45:32.259 --> 01:45:35.228
SOME RESIDENTS HAVE STATED THAT

01:45:35.295 --> 01:45:37.731
EDISON RELIED ON OUT OF DATE

01:45:37.798 --> 01:45:39.933
INFORMATION ON THEIR GRID,

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.035
LEADING TO EMPLOYEES BEING SENT

01:45:42.102 --> 01:45:43.136
OUT TO REPAIR ELECTRICAL

01:45:43.203 --> 01:45:45.706
EQUIPMENT IN WRONG LOCATIONS, OR

01:45:45.772 --> 01:45:47.107
RESIDENTS RECEIVING CONFLICTING

01:45:47.174 --> 01:45:49.309
AND INCORRECT AUTOMATED

01:45:49.376 --> 01:45:51.445
NOTIFICATIONS DURING THE PSPS,

01:45:51.511 --> 01:45:52.913
SOME CELL TOWERS LOST

01:45:52.979 --> 01:45:54.381
ELECTRICITY. RESIDENTS WITHOUT A

01:45:54.448 --> 01:45:55.816
LANDLINE WERE LEFT WITHOUT

01:45:55.882 --> 01:45:57.584
ACCESS TO ANY COMMUNICATION,

01:45:57.651 --> 01:45:58.919
EITHER BY PHONE OR INTERNET,

01:45:58.985 --> 01:46:01.521
MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTACT

01:46:01.588 --> 01:46:02.923
EMERGENCY SERVICES IN A TIMELY

01:46:02.989 --> 01:46:05.759
FASHION. DURING THIS EVENT,

01:46:05.826 --> 01:46:07.861
RESIDENTS EXPERIENCED DISRUPTION

01:46:07.928 --> 01:46:10.464
OF MEDICAL NECESSITY EQUIPMENT,

01:46:10.530 --> 01:46:12.466
SUBSEQUENT HOSPITALIZATION, LACK

01:46:12.532 --> 01:46:13.900
OF ACCESS TO DRINKING WATER, AND

01:46:13.967 --> 01:46:16.236
AN INABILITY TO LEAVE RESIDENTS

01:46:16.303 --> 01:46:18.772
THERE. RESIDENTS, THOSE THAT HAD

01:46:18.839 --> 01:46:21.241
LIMITED MOBILITY. AND THAT'S

01:46:21.308 --> 01:46:22.776
WHAT MY TEAM AND I WERE

01:46:22.843 --> 01:46:27.914
RESPONDING TO DURING THAT TIME.

01:46:27.981 --> 01:46:31.351
IN SHORT, MY DISTRICT, LIKE MANY

01:46:31.418 --> 01:46:33.153
OTHERS, HAVE FACED SUSTAINED

01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:34.955
PSPS EVENTS AND THAT MUST BE

01:46:35.021 --> 01:46:36.690
TREATED WITH THE DELICACY OF AN

01:46:36.757 --> 01:46:39.793
EMERGENCY RESPONSE. THIS BILL

01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:41.595
WILL BE HELPFUL NOT ONLY TO OUR

01:46:41.661 --> 01:46:43.163
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, NONPROFIT

01:46:43.230 --> 01:46:44.431
ORGANIZATIONS, BUT OUR

01:46:44.498 --> 01:46:46.166
LEGISLATIVE BODY AS WE ALLOCATE

01:46:46.233 --> 01:46:47.501
FUNDING FOR RESILIENCE, KNOWING

01:46:47.567 --> 01:46:49.369
WHICH COMMUNITIES ARE HIT THE

01:46:49.436 --> 01:46:51.972
HARDEST MOST OFTEN SHOULD BE

01:46:52.038 --> 01:46:54.374
BACKED BY DATA, THE DEMOGRAPHICS

01:46:54.441 --> 01:46:56.276
AND SOCIAL ECONOMIC DATA CENSUS

01:46:56.343 --> 01:46:58.445
TRACKS CAN HELP INFORM WHERE TO

01:46:58.512 --> 01:47:00.213
PRIORITIZE INVESTMENTS IN LOCAL

01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:02.716
SOLUTIONS THAT CAN HELP PROVIDE

01:47:02.783 --> 01:47:05.652
SUPPORT NOT ONLY IN NATURAL

01:47:05.719 --> 01:47:06.620
DISASTERS, BUT ALSO DURING

01:47:06.686 --> 01:47:09.556
OUTAGES AND CRISIS. IT IS

01:47:09.623 --> 01:47:10.991
CRUCIAL THAT ALL UTILITIES,

01:47:11.057 --> 01:47:11.958
WHETHER THEY ARE INVESTOR OWNED,

01:47:12.025 --> 01:47:14.995
PUBLICLY OWNED OR PART OF AN

01:47:15.061 --> 01:47:15.962
ELECTRIC CORPORATION

01:47:16.029 --> 01:47:16.730
COOPERATIVE, ARE MANDATED TO

01:47:16.797 --> 01:47:18.298
PROVIDE TRANSPARENT,

01:47:18.365 --> 01:47:20.100
COMPREHENSIVE AND EASILY

01:47:20.167 --> 01:47:21.668
INTERPRETABLE DATA. THE DATA

01:47:21.735 --> 01:47:23.236
SHOULD BE ACCESSIBLE AT THE

01:47:23.303 --> 01:47:25.005
GRANULAR LEVEL OF CENSUS TRACTS.

01:47:25.071 --> 01:47:26.773
THIS WILL HELP US TO ENSURE THAT

01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:28.542
COASTAL, INLAND, URBAN,

01:47:28.608 --> 01:47:30.477
SUBURBAN, RURAL AND TRIBAL AREAS

01:47:30.544 --> 01:47:32.612
WILL BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION

01:47:32.679 --> 01:47:34.347
AS THIS WOULD ENHANCE

01:47:34.414 --> 01:47:36.183
RELIABILITY. EMPOWER ALL USERS,

01:47:36.249 --> 01:47:37.317
INCLUDING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND

01:47:37.384 --> 01:47:38.718
COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS, TO

01:47:38.785 --> 01:47:40.954
RESPOND MORE EFFECTIVELY DURING

01:47:41.021 --> 01:47:44.090
OUTAGES. TODAY I HAVE BETHANY, A

01:47:44.157 --> 01:47:47.327
SCIENTIST AND PSC HEALTHY ENERGY

01:47:47.394 --> 01:47:49.462
AT PSC HEALTHY ENERGY, WHO

01:47:49.529 --> 01:47:52.966
FOCUSES ON RESILIENCE AND ENERGY

01:47:53.033 --> 01:47:56.837
EQUITY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT.

01:47:56.903 --> 01:47:58.872
THANK YOU. MY NAME IS BETHANY

01:47:58.939 --> 01:48:00.674
KWOKA AND I'M A SCIENTIST AT PSC

01:48:00.740 --> 01:48:02.175
HEALTHY ENERGY, WHICH IS A

01:48:02.242 --> 01:48:03.276
NONPROFIT RESEARCH INSTITUTE

01:48:03.343 --> 01:48:04.311
WORKING AT THE INTERSECTION OF

01:48:04.377 --> 01:48:06.246
ENERGY AND PUBLIC HEALTH. MY

01:48:06.313 --> 01:48:07.147
RESEARCH HAS INVOLVED WORKING

01:48:07.214 --> 01:48:09.349
WITH BOTH UTILITY AND STATE DATA

01:48:09.416 --> 01:48:10.517
TO UNDERSTAND ENERGY RESILIENCE

01:48:10.584 --> 01:48:11.985
NEEDS ACROSS THE STATE, AND

01:48:12.052 --> 01:48:13.386
INCLUDES DEVELOPING THE FIRST

01:48:13.453 --> 01:48:14.754
COMPREHENSIVE GEOSPATIAL DATA

01:48:14.821 --> 01:48:17.090
SET OF PSPS EVENTS IN CALIFORNIA

01:48:17.157 --> 01:48:18.491
AS PART OF A STATE FUNDED

01:48:18.558 --> 01:48:20.660
PROJECT ON RESILIENCE HUBS. TWO

01:48:20.727 --> 01:48:21.761
CORE OBSERVATIONS I'D LIKE TO

01:48:21.828 --> 01:48:23.597
SHARE FROM MY WORK RELEVANT TO

01:48:23.663 --> 01:48:25.198
THIS BILL, THE FIRST BEING MORE

01:48:25.265 --> 01:48:26.466
ACCURATE, MORE ACCURATE OUTAGE

01:48:26.533 --> 01:48:28.301
AND RELIABILITY DATA IS CRITICAL

01:48:28.368 --> 01:48:29.536
FOR IMPROVING COMMUNITY

01:48:29.603 --> 01:48:30.904
RESILIENCE. THIS ISN'T

01:48:30.971 --> 01:48:32.839
SURPRISING. IT'S WHY THE CPUC

01:48:32.906 --> 01:48:34.941
HAS REGULARLY UPDATED THE PSPS

01:48:35.008 --> 01:48:36.076
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OVER

01:48:36.142 --> 01:48:37.911
TIME, AND IS REVIEWING ANNUAL

01:48:37.978 --> 01:48:38.879
RELIABILITY REPORTING

01:48:38.945 --> 01:48:40.747
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE IOUS. OF

01:48:40.814 --> 01:48:42.115
PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE IS

01:48:42.182 --> 01:48:43.516
GEOSPATIAL INFORMATION ABOUT

01:48:43.583 --> 01:48:44.784
OUTAGES AND WHICH TYPES OF

01:48:44.851 --> 01:48:46.553
CUSTOMERS ARE BEING IMPACTED.

01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:47.554
REPORTING AT CENSUS TRACK LEVEL

01:48:47.621 --> 01:48:49.322
MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO ASSESS

01:48:49.389 --> 01:48:50.357
ECONOMIC AND DEMOGRAPHIC

01:48:50.423 --> 01:48:51.791
CONDITIONS AT A SCALE THAT IS

01:48:51.858 --> 01:48:53.693
OBSCURED WITHIN CURRENT

01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:54.361
REPORTING, WHILE STILL

01:48:54.427 --> 01:48:56.663
PROTECTING CUSTOMER PRIVACY. FOR

01:48:56.730 --> 01:48:58.398
EXAMPLE, LARGE REPORTING AREAS

01:48:58.465 --> 01:49:00.700
MAY HIDE THAT A RURAL COMMUNITY

01:49:00.767 --> 01:49:02.269
MIGHT BE EXPERIENCING LONG

01:49:02.335 --> 01:49:03.436
OUTAGES BECAUSE CURRENT

01:49:03.503 --> 01:49:04.771
RELIABILITY STATISTICS ARE

01:49:04.838 --> 01:49:06.172
WEIGHTED TOWARDS A MORE DENSELY

01:49:06.239 --> 01:49:08.108
POPULATED URBAN AREA WITH FEWER

01:49:08.174 --> 01:49:09.876
OUTAGES. IT'S ALSO CONSISTENT

01:49:09.943 --> 01:49:11.378
WITH OTHER STATE DEVELOPED

01:49:11.444 --> 01:49:13.079
DEMOGRAPHIC REPORTING, SUCH AS

01:49:13.146 --> 01:49:14.581
CALENVIROSCREEN, SB 535,

01:49:14.648 --> 01:49:15.515
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND

01:49:15.582 --> 01:49:17.050
CARB'S CLIMATE VULNERABILITY

01:49:17.117 --> 01:49:19.019
METRIC. THE SECOND OBSERVATION

01:49:19.085 --> 01:49:20.654
IS THAT LACK OF DATA FROM THE

01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:21.821
NON INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES

01:49:21.888 --> 01:49:23.857
CREATES GAPS FOR BOTH LOCAL AND

01:49:23.924 --> 01:49:25.458
STATE PLANNING. CALIFORNIA HAS

01:49:25.525 --> 01:49:27.494
MORE THAN 40 PUBLICLY OWNED

01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:28.895
UTILITIES SERVING BOTH URBAN AND

01:49:28.962 --> 01:49:30.297
RURAL COMMUNITIES, AS WELL AS

01:49:30.363 --> 01:49:32.132
ALMOST 40% OF CALIFORNIA'S

01:49:32.198 --> 01:49:33.700
DISADVANTAGED CENSUS TRACKS.

01:49:33.767 --> 01:49:34.668
SOME OF THESE UTILITIES HAVE

01:49:34.734 --> 01:49:36.503
MILLIONS OF CUSTOMERS, BUT ARE

01:49:36.569 --> 01:49:37.671
CURRENTLY NOT REQUIRED TO REPORT

01:49:37.737 --> 01:49:39.773
ON OUTAGES OR RELIABILITY, WHICH

01:49:39.839 --> 01:49:41.508
CAN MAKE IT INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT

01:49:41.574 --> 01:49:42.909
FOR COMMUNITIES TO INVEST IN

01:49:42.976 --> 01:49:44.144
RESILIENCE BUILDING SYSTEMS THAT

01:49:44.210 --> 01:49:45.378
PROTECT THEIR MOST VULNERABLE

01:49:45.445 --> 01:49:46.980
MEMBERS. ULTIMATELY, I FOUND

01:49:47.047 --> 01:49:47.881
THAT CURRENT REPORTING

01:49:47.948 --> 01:49:48.915
REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT ALWAYS

01:49:48.982 --> 01:49:50.583
GRANULAR ENOUGH. A LACK OF DATA

01:49:50.650 --> 01:49:52.652
FROM NON IOUS OBSCURES THE FULL

01:49:52.719 --> 01:49:54.721
PICTURE, AND IT SHOULD BE

01:49:54.788 --> 01:49:55.622
EMINENTLY POSSIBLE FOR AT LEAST

01:49:55.689 --> 01:49:57.357
THE LARGEST UTILITIES TO REPORT

01:49:57.424 --> 01:49:58.792
CENSUS TRACK LEVEL, OUTAGE AND

01:49:58.858 --> 01:50:01.561
RELIABILITY DATA. AND THIS

01:50:01.628 --> 01:50:02.062
REPORTING WOULD IMPROVE

01:50:02.128 --> 01:50:02.762
RESILIENCE DECISION MAKING AT

01:50:02.829 --> 01:50:05.699
ALL LEVELS. THANK YOU. AT THIS

01:50:05.765 --> 01:50:07.500
TIME, WE'LL OPEN IT UP FOR

01:50:07.567 --> 01:50:08.635
ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TESTIMONY. IF

01:50:08.702 --> 01:50:10.437
YOU'D LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT

01:50:10.503 --> 01:50:14.307
OF SB 292, YOU CAN APPROACH THE

01:50:14.374 --> 01:50:16.776
MICROPHONE. SEEING NONE MOVING

01:50:16.843 --> 01:50:18.645
TO OPPOSITION TESTIMONY, IS

01:50:18.712 --> 01:50:21.281
THERE A LEAD OPPOSITION WITNESS.

01:50:21.348 --> 01:50:24.751
SO COME ON UP. OR IF WE JUST

01:50:24.818 --> 01:50:27.420
HAVE ME TO OPPOSITION, GO AHEAD

01:50:27.487 --> 01:50:28.722
AND APPROACH THE MICROPHONE AT

01:50:28.788 --> 01:50:30.523
THIS TIME. THANK YOU, MADAM

01:50:30.590 --> 01:50:32.392
CHAIR. MEMBERS JOSE WITH SAN

01:50:32.459 --> 01:50:33.860
DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC. WE HAD

01:50:33.927 --> 01:50:34.828
OPPOSED. WE HAVEN'T OPPOSED

01:50:34.894 --> 01:50:35.795
UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE

01:50:35.862 --> 01:50:37.964
BILL IN PRINT. I APPRECIATE THE

01:50:38.031 --> 01:50:39.165
ANALYSIS. THE AMENDMENTS AND THE

01:50:39.232 --> 01:50:40.633
ANALYSIS LOOK LIKE THEY ADDRESS

01:50:40.700 --> 01:50:41.968
SOME OF OUR CONCERNS. WE JUST

01:50:42.035 --> 01:50:43.470
WANT TO SEE THE LANGUAGE IN

01:50:43.536 --> 01:50:44.671
PRINT AND THEN CONTINUE TO WORK

01:50:44.738 --> 01:50:46.673
WITH THE AUTHOR TO MAKE SURE

01:50:46.740 --> 01:50:51.544
THAT THERE AREN'T ANY

01:50:51.611 --> 01:50:52.278
DUPLICATIVE REPORTING MANDATES

01:50:52.345 --> 01:50:54.514
THAT WE'RE ALREADY DOING, BUT

01:50:54.581 --> 01:50:56.149
UNDERSTAND WHERE THE AUTHORS

01:50:56.216 --> 01:50:58.551
COME FROM. PACIFIC GAS ELECTRIC

01:50:58.618 --> 01:50:59.819
IN ALIGNMENT WITH SAN DIEGO.

01:50:59.886 --> 01:51:02.756
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. TRUJILLO.

01:51:02.822 --> 01:51:04.157
WITH SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON

01:51:04.224 --> 01:51:06.659
IN ALIGN WITH PGA AND SAN DIEGO.

01:51:06.726 --> 01:51:08.561
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. OKAY.

01:51:08.628 --> 01:51:11.097
BRINGING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE

01:51:11.164 --> 01:51:11.698
MEMBERS. QUESTIONS, COMMENTS.

01:51:11.765 --> 01:51:13.867
ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. BURR. FIRST, I

01:51:13.933 --> 01:51:16.503
WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR

01:51:16.569 --> 01:51:17.804
REALLY HER FOCUS, I THINK, ON

01:51:17.871 --> 01:51:19.572
SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT YOUR

01:51:19.639 --> 01:51:23.309
COMMUNITY HAS FACED. YOU KNOW, I

01:51:23.376 --> 01:51:24.711
HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE

01:51:24.778 --> 01:51:26.513
BILL, MAINLY BECAUSE I THINK

01:51:26.579 --> 01:51:29.482
SOME OF THESE ISSUES ARE REALLY

01:51:29.549 --> 01:51:31.084
MORE APPROPRIATE FOR REGULATORY

01:51:31.151 --> 01:51:31.785
RULEMAKING, AND THERE'S SOME

01:51:31.851 --> 01:51:33.686
OPEN RATE CASES THAT I THINK ARE

01:51:33.753 --> 01:51:34.954
DEALING WITH SOME OF THESE

01:51:35.021 --> 01:51:36.556
THINGS. AND SO WHEN I WAS

01:51:36.623 --> 01:51:38.091
LISTENING TO YOUR TO YOUR AUTHOR

01:51:38.158 --> 01:51:39.959
THERE, THE KINDS OF YOUR WITNESS

01:51:40.026 --> 01:51:40.860
THERE, THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT

01:51:40.927 --> 01:51:42.796
ARE VERY, VERY TECHNICAL AND I

01:51:42.862 --> 01:51:44.564
THINK GENERALLY SHOULD BE DONE

01:51:44.631 --> 01:51:46.332
AT THE REGULATORY LEVEL BECAUSE

01:51:46.399 --> 01:51:48.535
THEY'RE SCIENTIFIC. AND YOU NEED

01:51:48.601 --> 01:51:49.536
TO UNDERSTAND THOSE KINDS OF

01:51:49.602 --> 01:51:53.606
THINGS. YOU KNOW, THAT SAID, I'M

01:51:53.673 --> 01:51:55.975
GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY

01:51:56.042 --> 01:51:57.444
AND ENCOURAGE YOU TO SORT OF

01:51:57.510 --> 01:51:58.745
THINK ABOUT WHAT SHOULD ACTUALLY

01:51:58.812 --> 01:52:00.313
BE DONE AT THE REGULATORY LEVEL,

01:52:00.380 --> 01:52:01.848
RATHER THAN PUTTING THINGS IN

01:52:01.915 --> 01:52:04.717
THE BILL THAT ARE VERY SPECIFIC

01:52:04.784 --> 01:52:06.219
AND, YOU KNOW, COULD HAVE

01:52:06.286 --> 01:52:07.587
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. AND SO

01:52:07.654 --> 01:52:08.822
I'M HOPING YOU'LL CONTINUE TO

01:52:08.888 --> 01:52:10.824
WORK WITH, YOU KNOW, ALL OF THE

01:52:10.890 --> 01:52:13.793
STAKEHOLDERS, FRANKLY, AND, AND,

01:52:13.860 --> 01:52:16.529
AND FOCUS ON THE THINGS THAT ARE

01:52:16.596 --> 01:52:18.631
ONES THAT I THINK REQUIRE

01:52:18.698 --> 01:52:21.167
SCIENTIFIC AND REGULATORY

01:52:21.234 --> 01:52:22.202
DETERMINATIONS IN TERMS OF THE

01:52:22.268 --> 01:52:24.771
IN TERMS OF THE IMPACTS. SO WITH

01:52:24.838 --> 01:52:27.407
THAT, I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL

01:52:27.474 --> 01:52:30.977
TODAY. ALL RIGHT. SEEING NO

01:56:20.273 --> 01:56:23.209
FOR YOUR INDULGENCE. I'M PLEASED

01:56:23.276 --> 01:56:24.877
TO PRESENT SB 473, A BILL

01:56:24.944 --> 01:56:25.978
FOCUSED ON WATER RATE,

01:56:26.045 --> 01:56:27.780
AFFORDABILITY AND CONSERVATION,

01:56:27.847 --> 01:56:30.316
FOLLOW UP TO SB 1469 BY SENATOR

01:56:30.383 --> 01:56:31.050
BRADFORD, WHICH WAS PASSED BY

01:56:31.117 --> 01:56:32.852
THE LEGISLATURE, SIGNED INTO LAW

01:56:32.919 --> 01:56:36.122
BY THE GOVERNOR IN 2022. SB 473

01:56:36.189 --> 01:56:37.824
IS A COMMON SENSE BILL THAT

01:56:37.890 --> 01:56:38.925
DIRECTLY AND MEANINGFULLY, WILL

01:56:38.991 --> 01:56:40.426
IMPACT WATER AFFORDABILITY FOR

01:56:40.493 --> 01:56:42.128
MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS,

01:56:42.195 --> 01:56:43.429
PROVIDING SAFE, CLEAN DRINKING

01:56:43.496 --> 01:56:44.897
WATER TO CALIFORNIANS IS A

01:56:44.964 --> 01:56:45.965
COMPLEX TASK. REQUIRES

01:56:46.032 --> 01:56:47.066
MAINTAINING CRITICAL

01:56:47.133 --> 01:56:48.868
INFRASTRUCTURE, ALL OF WHICH

01:56:48.935 --> 01:56:50.903
REQUIRE STABLE FUNDING FOR

01:56:50.970 --> 01:56:52.805
MAINTENANCE AND IMPROVEMENTS.

01:56:52.872 --> 01:56:53.940
DECOUPLING, A RATE SETTING

01:56:54.006 --> 01:56:55.341
MECHANISM USED BY ENERGY AND

01:56:55.408 --> 01:56:56.776
WATER UTILITIES, MAINTAINS

01:56:56.843 --> 01:56:58.378
CUSTOMER AFFORDABILITY BY

01:56:58.444 --> 01:56:59.579
LOWERING THE COSTS ASSOCIATED

01:56:59.645 --> 01:57:01.514
WITH INFRASTRUCTURE MAINTENANCE.

01:57:01.581 --> 01:57:03.383
FOR THOSE WHO USE THE LEAST

01:57:03.449 --> 01:57:04.784
AMOUNT OF WATER, DECOUPLING IS

01:57:04.851 --> 01:57:06.819
USED WHEN SETTING UTILITY RATES,

01:57:06.886 --> 01:57:08.755
ALL APPROVED BY THE CPUC TO

01:57:08.821 --> 01:57:10.123
SEPARATE THE AMOUNT OF

01:57:10.189 --> 01:57:11.591
ELECTRICITY, GAS, OR WATER

01:57:11.657 --> 01:57:13.459
CUSTOMERS USE FROM THE AMOUNT OF

01:57:13.526 --> 01:57:15.928
REVENUE THOSE UTILITY COMPANIES

01:57:15.995 --> 01:57:17.764
COLLECT. PLAIN AND SIMPLE, IT

01:57:17.830 --> 01:57:19.866
SEPARATES CUSTOMER USAGE FROM A

01:57:19.932 --> 01:57:22.502
UTILITY'S REVENUE. THIS REMOVES

01:57:22.568 --> 01:57:24.537
THE INCENTIVE TO SELL AS MUCH

01:57:24.604 --> 01:57:26.005
WATER AS POSSIBLE, AND INSTEAD

01:57:26.072 --> 01:57:27.273
ALLOWS THE STATE AND UTILITY TO

01:57:27.340 --> 01:57:28.908
PROMOTE CONSERVATION AND

01:57:28.975 --> 01:57:30.710
EFFICIENCY. DECOUPLED RATE

01:57:30.777 --> 01:57:31.844
STRUCTURES WERE INITIALLY

01:57:31.911 --> 01:57:33.179
INTRODUCED AS A PILOT PROGRAM

01:57:33.246 --> 01:57:35.715
FOR WATER BY THE CPUC. DATA

01:57:35.782 --> 01:57:37.517
SHOWED THAT DURING THAT PILOT

01:57:37.583 --> 01:57:38.684
PROGRAM, UTILITIES HAD

01:57:38.751 --> 01:57:40.052
IMPLEMENTED DECOUPLING AVERAGED

01:57:40.119 --> 01:57:43.089
A 29% DECREASE IN CUSTOMER WATER

01:57:43.156 --> 01:57:46.592
USE FROM 2009 TO 2021, WHILE

01:57:46.659 --> 01:57:48.060
THOSE THAT DID NOT DECOUPLE

01:57:48.127 --> 01:57:49.896
EXPERIENCED ONLY A 24% DECREASE.

01:57:49.962 --> 01:57:51.998
THE DIFFERENCE OF ABOUT 11

01:57:52.064 --> 01:57:55.168
BILLION GALLONS OF WATER.

01:57:55.234 --> 01:57:56.569
DESPITE THE SUCCESS OF THE PILOT

01:57:56.636 --> 01:57:58.805
AND THE PASSAGE OF SB 1469,

01:57:58.871 --> 01:58:00.973
WHICH REQUIRED THE CPUC TO

01:58:01.040 --> 01:58:02.742
REVIEW DECOUPLING REQUESTS, THE

01:58:02.809 --> 01:58:04.844
CPUC HAS DENIED ALL DECOUPLING

01:58:04.911 --> 01:58:06.579
REQUESTS OF REGULATED WATER

01:58:06.646 --> 01:58:08.414
COMPANIES, DISCOURAGING PROGRAMS

01:58:08.481 --> 01:58:09.982
THAT HELP MAKE WATER BILLS MORE

01:58:10.049 --> 01:58:11.517
AFFORDABLE DIRECTLY, RESULTING

01:58:11.584 --> 01:58:13.419
IN HIGHER BILLS FOR CUSTOMERS,

01:58:13.486 --> 01:58:17.156
WHICH MOTIVATED THIS BILL. SB

01:58:17.223 --> 01:58:18.524
473 OFFERS A PERMANENT SOLUTION

01:58:18.591 --> 01:58:20.092
BY ENSURING THAT PUC PERMITS

01:58:20.159 --> 01:58:21.794
WATER UTILITIES TO USE

01:58:21.861 --> 01:58:23.996
DECOUPLING. UTILITIES THAT

01:58:24.063 --> 01:58:25.198
IMPLEMENT DECOUPLING CAN KEEP

01:58:25.264 --> 01:58:26.566
WATER RATES LOWER THAN OTHER

01:58:26.632 --> 01:58:28.367
RATE MECHANISMS, BY CREATING

01:58:28.434 --> 01:58:29.368
TIERS FOR WATER USE THAT ENABLE

01:58:29.435 --> 01:58:32.271
THOSE THAT USE LESS TO PAY LESS

01:58:32.338 --> 01:58:33.739
PER UNIT, AND THOSE THAT USE

01:58:33.806 --> 01:58:35.608
MORE TO PAY MORE. BY CREATING

01:58:35.675 --> 01:58:36.309
TIERED RATE STRUCTURES, WATER

01:58:36.375 --> 01:58:38.144
UTILITIES ARE ABLE TO SHIFT MORE

01:58:38.211 --> 01:58:39.212
OF THEIR COSTS TO HIGHER USE,

01:58:39.278 --> 01:58:41.214
HIGHER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. IN THE

01:58:41.280 --> 01:58:43.115
YEARS THAT THE WATER UTILITY

01:58:43.182 --> 01:58:44.450
COLLECTS MORE REVENUE THAN

01:58:44.517 --> 01:58:45.585
PROJECTED, THE UTILITY WILL

01:58:45.651 --> 01:58:47.487
ISSUE A CREDIT BACK TO THE

01:58:47.553 --> 01:58:48.855
CONSUMER WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER

01:58:48.921 --> 01:58:49.922
RATE MAKING STRATEGIES.

01:58:49.989 --> 01:58:51.057
DECOUPLING ALLOWS FOR LOWER

01:58:51.123 --> 01:58:54.060
WATER RATES, LOWER USE FOR LOWER

01:58:54.126 --> 01:58:56.128
USE, AND MEDIUM USE CUSTOMERS.

01:58:56.195 --> 01:58:58.431
FOR EXAMPLE, IN AREAS JUST IN MY

01:58:58.498 --> 01:58:59.265
DISTRICT IN CALIPATRIA AND

01:58:59.332 --> 01:59:00.833
NILAND IN THE IMPERIAL COUNTY,

01:59:00.900 --> 01:59:02.568
WHERE DECOUPLING HAS NOW BEEN

01:59:02.635 --> 01:59:04.670
DENIED BY THE CPUC, WATER RATES

01:59:04.737 --> 01:59:06.272
FOR THE BOTTOM TIERS OF WATER

01:59:06.339 --> 01:59:08.975
USERS HAVE GONE UP BY AS MUCH AS

01:59:09.041 --> 01:59:10.776
116%, WHILE TOP TIER WATER USERS

01:59:10.843 --> 01:59:13.346
ARE SEEING BILL REDUCTIONS OF UP

01:59:13.412 --> 01:59:15.147
TO 17.9%. THIS IS SENDING THE

01:59:15.214 --> 01:59:16.916
EXACT OPPOSITE MESSAGE THAT THE

01:59:16.983 --> 01:59:19.118
STATE IS TRYING TO SEND ON BOTH

01:59:19.185 --> 01:59:20.152
AFFORDABILITY AND ON

01:59:20.219 --> 01:59:21.954
CONSERVATION. WITH ME TODAY, I'M

01:59:22.021 --> 01:59:23.523
PLEASED TO HAVE SCOTT WETCH WITH

01:59:23.589 --> 01:59:25.424

MISPRONOUNCE THIS CAITLIN WITH

01:59:29.161 --> 01:59:30.363

SERVICE. THIS IS THE LARGEST

01:59:49.682 --> 01:59:51.784
WATER UTILITY REGULATED BY THE

01:59:51.851 --> 01:59:53.219
CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES

01:59:53.286 --> 01:59:55.121
COMMISSION. PREVIOUSLY, I SERVED

01:59:55.187 --> 01:59:56.556
AS DIRECTOR OF THE WATER

01:59:56.622 --> 01:59:59.392
DIVISION FOR 12 YEARS FROM 2007

01:59:59.458 --> 02:00:01.661
THROUGH 2019. AT THE OUTSET, I'D

02:00:01.727 --> 02:00:03.062
LIKE TO THANK SENATOR PADILLA

02:00:03.129 --> 02:00:04.797
FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS

02:00:04.864 --> 02:00:06.999
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TOPIC. THE

02:00:07.066 --> 02:00:09.402
RATIONALE FOR SENATE BILL 473

02:00:09.468 --> 02:00:10.903
BOILS DOWN TO REALLY JUST TWO

02:00:10.970 --> 02:00:12.705
FACTORS WATER CONSERVATION AND

02:00:12.772 --> 02:00:14.907
WATER AFFORDABILITY. AND WITH

02:00:14.974 --> 02:00:16.776
DECOUPLING, WATER UTILITIES CAN

02:00:16.842 --> 02:00:20.079
DO BOTH. IN 2005, THE CPUC

02:00:20.146 --> 02:00:22.114
ADOPTED ITS WATER ACTION PLAN,

02:00:22.181 --> 02:00:23.883
WHICH SOUGHT TO APPLY BEST

02:00:23.950 --> 02:00:25.384
PRACTICES FROM THE ENERGY

02:00:25.451 --> 02:00:27.153
UTILITIES TO THE WATER

02:00:27.219 --> 02:00:28.921
UTILITIES. DECOUPLING CHANGE THE

02:00:28.988 --> 02:00:31.157
WATER UTILITY BUSINESS MODEL

02:00:31.223 --> 02:00:33.626
FROM SELLING WATER TO CONSERVING

02:00:33.693 --> 02:00:35.161
WATER, AND IT ALLOWED FOR

02:00:35.227 --> 02:00:36.996
PROGRESSIVE WATER RATE DESIGNS

02:00:37.063 --> 02:00:38.664
WHERE YOU PAY MORE FOR HIGHER

02:00:38.731 --> 02:00:40.800
WATER USE. THE RESULT? INDUSTRY

02:00:40.866 --> 02:00:42.902
LEADING WATER CONSERVATION,

02:00:42.969 --> 02:00:44.770
AFFORDABLE WATER BILLS FOR

02:00:44.837 --> 02:00:46.138
CUSTOMERS AND REVENUE STABILITY

02:00:46.205 --> 02:00:48.341
FOR WATER UTILITIES. YOU KNOW,

02:00:48.407 --> 02:00:49.875
BEFORE DECOUPLING WAS BROUGHT TO

02:00:49.942 --> 02:00:51.544
THE WATER INDUSTRY, WATER

02:00:51.611 --> 02:00:53.346
CONSERVATION WAS CONSIDERED BAD

02:00:53.412 --> 02:00:54.714
FOR BUSINESS, RIGHT? WHY WOULD A

02:00:54.780 --> 02:00:57.249
WATER UTILITY WANT TO SELL LESS

02:00:57.316 --> 02:00:58.651
PRODUCT? THAT'S WHY THE BUSINESS

02:00:58.718 --> 02:01:00.486
MODEL HAD TO BE CHANGED. AND

02:01:00.553 --> 02:01:03.556
WHEN THE CPUC DECIDED IN 2020 TO

02:01:03.623 --> 02:01:05.625
NO LONGER FOLLOW ITS OWN WATER

02:01:05.691 --> 02:01:07.860
ACTION PLAN, THE ENSUING RESULTS

02:01:07.927 --> 02:01:09.328
WERE INEVITABLE. HIGHER RATES

02:01:09.395 --> 02:01:11.397
AND HIGHER BILLS FOR LOW USER,

02:01:11.464 --> 02:01:13.566
LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS, WITH RATE

02:01:13.633 --> 02:01:16.168
BENEFITS ACCRUING TO HIGH WATER

02:01:16.235 --> 02:01:17.970
USERS AND THE CONSERVATION

02:01:18.037 --> 02:01:20.172
SIGNAL DIMINISHED. THIS WAS A

02:01:20.239 --> 02:01:21.841
PREDICTABLE RESULT, AS WE JUST

02:01:21.907 --> 02:01:22.842
HEARD FROM SENATOR PADILLA IN

02:01:22.908 --> 02:01:26.212
HIS DISTRICT DECOUPLING CAPS,

02:01:26.278 --> 02:01:28.114
UTILITY REVENUES, AND IT'S A TWO

02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:29.815
WAY MECHANISM THAT RETURNS

02:01:29.882 --> 02:01:31.917
DOLLARS TO CUSTOMERS WHEN

02:01:31.984 --> 02:01:33.219
REVENUES COME IN ABOVE

02:01:33.285 --> 02:01:35.688
PROJECTIONS, AND VICE VERSA.

02:01:35.755 --> 02:01:36.989
DECOUPLING BENEFITS CUSTOMERS

02:01:37.056 --> 02:01:39.091
AND UTILITIES EQUALLY AND DOES

02:01:39.158 --> 02:01:42.028
NOT ALLOW FOR EXCESS EARNINGS OR

02:01:42.094 --> 02:01:44.096
PROFITS. UTILITIES ONLY RECEIVE

02:01:44.163 --> 02:01:46.365
REVENUES THAT THE CPUC

02:01:46.432 --> 02:01:47.833
AUTHORIZES. I RESPECTFULLY

02:01:47.900 --> 02:01:49.602
REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS

02:01:49.669 --> 02:01:51.370
IMPORTANT BILL. THANK YOU. THANK

02:01:51.437 --> 02:01:52.071
YOU, MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS.

02:01:52.138 --> 02:01:54.040
SCOTT WETCH, ON BEHALF OF THE

02:01:54.106 --> 02:01:55.107
CALIFORNIA STATE PIPE TRADES

02:01:55.174 --> 02:01:56.442
COUNCIL AND THE CALIFORNIA

02:01:56.509 --> 02:01:58.210
COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES,

02:01:58.277 --> 02:02:00.446
BY ENSURING THAT WATER UTILITIES

02:02:00.513 --> 02:02:02.214
DO NOT OVER COLLECT OR UNDER

02:02:02.281 --> 02:02:04.750
COLLECT, SB 473 PROVIDES

02:02:04.817 --> 02:02:06.052
TRANSPARENCY AND REVENUE

02:02:06.118 --> 02:02:08.320
STABILITY THAT'S VITAL TO BOTH

02:02:08.387 --> 02:02:10.489
UTILITIES AND RATEPAYERS. UNDER

02:02:10.556 --> 02:02:11.857
DECOUPLING, THE WATER UTILITY

02:02:11.924 --> 02:02:13.993
PRESENTS A GRC TO THE COMMISSION

02:02:14.060 --> 02:02:15.861
AND THE CPUC APPROVES A REVENUE

02:02:15.928 --> 02:02:18.030
LIMIT TO COVER COSTS. THIS

02:02:18.097 --> 02:02:19.565
ALLOWS WATER UTILITIES TO PLAN

02:02:19.632 --> 02:02:21.167
AND SCHEDULE SYSTEM

02:02:21.233 --> 02:02:23.102
IMPROVEMENTS. IT ALSO ALLOWS

02:02:23.169 --> 02:02:24.837
THEM TO DO SOMETHING VERY

02:02:24.904 --> 02:02:26.272
IMPORTANT TO MY MEMBERS IS

02:02:26.338 --> 02:02:27.506
COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN BECAUSE

02:02:27.573 --> 02:02:28.474
THEY KNOW WHAT THEIR REVENUE

02:02:28.541 --> 02:02:30.676
WILL BE. UNDER DECOUPLING.

02:02:30.743 --> 02:02:33.546
THERE'S AN ANNUAL TRUE UP THAT

02:02:33.612 --> 02:02:35.381
TRIGGER EITHER A CREDIT TO

02:02:35.448 --> 02:02:37.383
RATEPAYERS OR A SURCHARGE.

02:02:37.450 --> 02:02:41.787
EXAMPLE COLUMN IN 2023, UNDER

02:02:41.854 --> 02:02:45.424

02:02:45.491 --> 02:02:48.961
VERY NEXT YEAR IN 2024, IT

02:02:49.028 --> 02:02:51.497
OVERCOLLECTED BY 15.4 MILLION.

02:02:51.564 --> 02:02:53.165
AND THERE IS NO MECHANISM TO

02:02:53.232 --> 02:02:55.668
REALLY TRUE THAT UP. IT IS THIS.

02:02:55.735 --> 02:02:58.270
IT IS THESE WILD SWINGS THAT

02:02:58.337 --> 02:03:00.973
DECOUPLING PREVENTS ALL ELECTRIC

02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:03.109

02:03:03.175 --> 02:03:05.177
METHOD AND LET ME READ THE

02:03:05.244 --> 02:03:06.579
SAFEGUARDS THAT ARE IN THE BILL

SHALL BE DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT

02:03:15.354 --> 02:03:17.490
THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ACTUAL

02:03:19.658 --> 02:03:22.361
NOT RESULT IN THE OVER RECOVERY

02:03:22.428 --> 02:03:24.697
OR UNDER RECOVERY OF THE WATER

02:03:24.764 --> 02:03:26.065

SALES REVENUE LIE ON ON THE VERY

02:03:29.769 --> 02:03:34.240
NEXT PAGE. EXCUSE ME, SECTION C

02:03:34.306 --> 02:03:36.208
AND AUTHORIZED DECOUPLING

02:03:36.275 --> 02:03:37.643
MECHANISM SHALL NOT ENABLE THE

02:03:37.710 --> 02:03:39.411
WATER CORPORATION TO EARN A

02:03:39.478 --> 02:03:41.113

02:03:51.323 --> 02:03:53.826
A SURCHARGE ON WATER SERVICE IN

02:03:53.893 --> 02:03:56.896
ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 7.39.10,

02:03:56.962 --> 02:03:59.198
SHALL NOT RESULT IN REVENUES

02:03:59.265 --> 02:04:01.700
ABOVE THOSE APPROVED BY THE

02:04:15.815 --> 02:04:17.850

02:07:09.922 --> 02:07:11.623
STAFF FOR TAKING THE TIME TO

02:07:11.690 --> 02:07:12.958
MEET WITH OUR OFFICE TO HEAR OUR

02:07:13.025 --> 02:07:15.160
CONCERNS. WE HAVE ACTED AS A

02:07:15.227 --> 02:07:16.495
VOICE OF RATEPAYERS OVER THESE

02:07:16.562 --> 02:07:19.064
LAST MANY YEARS, WITH A SPECIFIC

02:07:19.131 --> 02:07:20.532
FOCUS ON WATER RATE MAKING

02:07:20.599 --> 02:07:22.701
POLICY. THE FOCUS OF THIS BILL

02:07:22.768 --> 02:07:24.303
IS ONE THAT WE HAVE VOCALIZED

02:07:24.370 --> 02:07:26.138
CONCERNS ABOUT DURING THESE MANY

02:07:26.205 --> 02:07:28.007
YEARS. THE WATER REVENUE

02:07:28.073 --> 02:07:29.441
ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM, ALSO KNOWN

02:07:29.508 --> 02:07:33.045
AS RAM. UNDER RAM, CUSTOMERS

02:07:33.112 --> 02:07:34.413
WILL NOT BE LIMITED TO PAYING

02:07:34.480 --> 02:07:35.948
FOR THE AMOUNT OF WATER THAT

02:07:36.015 --> 02:07:38.450
THEY USE. RATHER, THEY WILL PAY

02:07:38.517 --> 02:07:40.419
FOR THE AMOUNT OF WATER THAT

02:07:40.486 --> 02:07:42.087
THEIR WATER UTILITY FORECASTS

02:07:42.154 --> 02:07:43.822
THAT THEY WILL USE. SO HERE'S

02:07:43.889 --> 02:07:45.924
WHAT THAT WILL LOOK LIKE,

02:07:45.991 --> 02:07:46.759
BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF A

02:07:46.825 --> 02:07:48.827
LOT OF INFORMATION ON THIS BILL,

02:07:48.894 --> 02:07:50.095
A WATER UTILITY AND ITS GENERAL

02:07:50.162 --> 02:07:52.031
RATE CASE WILL FORECAST HOW MUCH

02:07:52.097 --> 02:07:54.666
WATER ITS CUSTOMERS WILL USE AND

02:07:54.733 --> 02:07:56.802
PAY FOR IN THE FUTURE. IF A

02:07:56.869 --> 02:07:59.638
CUSTOMER USES LESS THAN WHAT WAS

02:07:59.705 --> 02:08:01.106
FORECASTED, THE WATER UTILITY

02:08:01.173 --> 02:08:02.641
WILL STILL GET TO COLLECT THE

02:08:02.708 --> 02:08:05.411
FULL AMOUNT THAT WAS FORECASTED.

02:08:05.477 --> 02:08:07.246
HERE'S WHAT THE DATA OF

02:08:07.312 --> 02:08:08.680
IMPLEMENTING RAM HAS SHOWN. AND

02:08:08.747 --> 02:08:11.216
THIS IS TEN YEARS WORTH OF WELL

02:08:11.283 --> 02:08:12.184
DOCUMENTED DATA THAT WE HAVE AS

02:08:12.251 --> 02:08:15.621
A STATE. FIRST, THERE IS NO

02:08:15.687 --> 02:08:17.656
EVIDENCE TO PROVE OR EVEN

02:08:17.723 --> 02:08:19.792
INDICATE THAT RAM HELPS WITH

02:08:19.858 --> 02:08:20.793
CONSERVATION OR PROVIDES ANY

02:08:20.859 --> 02:08:22.628
OTHER BENEFIT TO WATER CUSTOMERS

02:08:22.694 --> 02:08:25.230
OR THE GENERAL PUBLIC INTEREST.

02:08:25.297 --> 02:08:27.099
SECOND, AND THESE ARE DOCUMENTED

02:08:27.166 --> 02:08:29.868
FACTS. I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE RAM

02:08:29.935 --> 02:08:32.171
INCREASES RATES AND INCREASES

02:08:32.237 --> 02:08:34.540
WATER UTILITY PROFITS OVER THE

02:08:34.606 --> 02:08:36.708
COURSE OF TEN YEARS. RAM, AS

02:08:36.775 --> 02:08:38.911
IMPLEMENTED BY HALF OF THE CPUC

02:08:38.977 --> 02:08:41.046
REGULATED WATER UTILITIES,

02:08:41.113 --> 02:08:43.582
INCREASED COSTS TO RATEPAYERS BY

02:08:43.649 --> 02:08:46.819
APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION. TO BE

02:08:46.885 --> 02:08:48.720
CLEAR, BASED ON DATA COLLECTED

02:08:48.787 --> 02:08:51.156
OVER THE SPAN OF TEN YEARS, THIS

02:08:51.223 --> 02:08:52.391
BILL INCREASES RATES. THANK YOU

02:08:52.458 --> 02:08:54.426
FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. THANK

02:08:54.493 --> 02:08:56.562
YOU, MADAM CHAIR. MY NAME IS

02:08:56.628 --> 02:08:57.996
RICHARD RUSCHMEYER. I'M THE

02:08:58.063 --> 02:08:59.398
DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF WATER AND

02:08:59.465 --> 02:09:00.799
COMMUNICATIONS AT THE PUBLIC

02:09:00.866 --> 02:09:01.667
ADVOCATE'S OFFICE AT THE

02:09:01.733 --> 02:09:03.001
CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES

02:09:03.068 --> 02:09:05.070
COMMISSION. AS ANNABELLE

02:09:05.137 --> 02:09:07.739
MENTIONED, THESE MECHANISMS WERE

02:09:07.806 --> 02:09:09.108
STUDIED AT THE COMMISSION OVER A

02:09:09.174 --> 02:09:12.544
PERIOD OF TEN YEARS, FROM 2009

02:09:12.611 --> 02:09:14.146
TO 2019. TWO MECHANISMS IN

02:09:14.213 --> 02:09:15.581
PARTICULAR WERE STUDIED THE FULL

02:09:15.647 --> 02:09:17.516
RAM, WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF

02:09:17.583 --> 02:09:20.385
THIS BILL, AS WELL AS A

02:09:20.452 --> 02:09:22.454
CONSERVATION RAM DECOUPLING,

02:09:22.521 --> 02:09:23.922
ALSO KNOWN AS A MONTEREY STYLE

02:09:23.989 --> 02:09:26.959
RAM OR A CART MECHANISM. OVER

02:09:27.025 --> 02:09:28.627
THOSE TEN YEARS OF STUDY, THE

02:09:28.694 --> 02:09:30.295
COMMISSION FOUND REPEATEDLY THAT

02:09:30.362 --> 02:09:32.564
THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN

02:09:32.631 --> 02:09:33.932
CONSERVATION BETWEEN THE TWO,

02:09:33.999 --> 02:09:35.234
BUT AS ANNABELLE MENTIONED,

02:09:35.300 --> 02:09:36.435
THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT

02:09:36.502 --> 02:09:37.903
DIFFERENCE IN THE COST TO

02:09:37.970 --> 02:09:40.372
RATEPAYERS WITH THE FULL RAM

02:09:40.439 --> 02:09:42.274
REVENUE DECOUPLING COSTING

02:09:42.341 --> 02:09:44.510
RATEPAYERS APPROXIMATELY $1

02:09:44.576 --> 02:09:47.012
BILLION MORE. SO HAVING

02:09:47.079 --> 02:09:47.946
CUSTOMERS PAY FOR WATER THAT

02:09:48.013 --> 02:09:49.982
THEY DIDN'T ACTUALLY USE, IT'S

02:09:50.048 --> 02:09:52.084
NOT AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO

02:09:52.151 --> 02:09:52.985
INCENTIVIZE WATER CONSERVATION,

02:09:53.051 --> 02:09:56.288
AND IT UNDERMINES BOTH CUSTOMER

02:09:56.355 --> 02:09:58.590
AFFORDABILITY AND UTILITY

02:09:58.657 --> 02:09:59.758
ACCOUNTABILITY. AND AS A RESULT,

02:09:59.825 --> 02:10:02.027
THE CPUC IN 2019 ENDED FULL

02:10:02.094 --> 02:10:03.962
REVENUE DECOUPLING AND ALLOWED

02:10:04.029 --> 02:10:05.764
ALL WATER UTILITIES TO

02:10:05.831 --> 02:10:07.466
TRANSITION TO THE OTHER RATE

02:10:07.533 --> 02:10:09.301
MECHANISM THAT'S CURRENTLY IN

02:10:09.368 --> 02:10:10.669
PLACE. THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN

02:10:10.736 --> 02:10:13.138
PLACE FOR THE OTHER HALF OF THE

02:10:13.205 --> 02:10:15.340
WATER UTILITIES SINCE THAT,

02:10:15.407 --> 02:10:18.744
SINCE THEN 2019, THE CPC HAS

02:10:18.810 --> 02:10:20.045
CONSISTENTLY, EXCUSE ME,

02:10:20.112 --> 02:10:21.747
CONSISTENTLY REJECTED REQUESTS

02:10:21.813 --> 02:10:24.750
FROM THE LARGE WATER UTILITIES

02:10:24.816 --> 02:10:26.218
TO REINSTATE THE FULL REVENUE

02:10:26.285 --> 02:10:27.619
DECOUPLING MECHANISM, INCLUDING

02:10:27.686 --> 02:10:29.087
FOR RECENT DECISIONS. IN THE

02:10:29.154 --> 02:10:31.790
PAST YEAR, SB 473 WOULD OVERTURN

02:10:31.857 --> 02:10:32.991
THOSE COMMISSION DECISIONS,

02:10:33.058 --> 02:10:34.927
IGNORE THE RESULTS OF TEN YEARS

02:10:34.993 --> 02:10:36.595
OF PILOT STUDY RESULTS, AND

02:10:36.662 --> 02:10:38.564
WOULD FORCE THE COMMISSION TO

02:10:38.630 --> 02:10:39.965
REINSTATE FULL REVENUE

02:10:40.032 --> 02:10:40.866
DECOUPLING. ULTIMATELY, THIS

02:10:40.933 --> 02:10:43.335
BILL IS NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST

02:10:43.402 --> 02:10:44.503
OF RATEPAYERS AND, BASED UPON

02:10:44.570 --> 02:10:46.138
TEN YEARS OF STUDY RESULTS,

02:10:46.205 --> 02:10:48.173
WOULD LEAD TO MUCH HIGHER WATER

02:10:48.240 --> 02:10:49.575
UTILITY BILLS IN THE STATE OF

02:10:49.641 --> 02:10:51.376
CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR YOUR

02:10:51.443 --> 02:10:52.477
TIME, AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER

02:10:52.544 --> 02:10:54.313
ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE.

02:10:54.379 --> 02:10:56.949
THANK YOU. MOVING TO ADDITIONAL

02:10:57.015 --> 02:10:58.250
TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION, GO

02:10:58.317 --> 02:10:59.618
AHEAD AND APPROACH THE

02:10:59.685 --> 02:11:01.453
MICROPHONE. GOOD AFTERNOON,

02:11:01.520 --> 02:11:02.754
CHAIR AND MEMBERS. LORI JOHNSON,

02:11:02.821 --> 02:11:04.389
ON BEHALF OF THE MONTEREY

02:11:04.456 --> 02:11:05.324
PENINSULA WATER MANAGEMENT

02:11:05.390 --> 02:11:07.259
DISTRICT. AND IT'S 92,000

02:11:07.326 --> 02:11:10.095
RATEPAYERS IN STRONG OPPOSITION.

02:11:10.162 --> 02:11:11.496
ALL RIGHT. LET'S BRING IT BACK

02:11:11.563 --> 02:11:12.998
TO THE COMMITTEE. QUESTIONS?

02:11:13.065 --> 02:11:14.800
COMMENTS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHEN

02:11:14.866 --> 02:11:16.268
THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR. I ASK

02:11:16.335 --> 02:11:17.669
SOME QUESTIONS IN RESPONSE TO

02:11:17.736 --> 02:11:18.604
THE TESTIMONY FROM THE

02:11:18.670 --> 02:11:22.708
OPPOSITION. FOR MR. WELCH, WHAT

02:11:22.774 --> 02:11:25.544
IS THE COST IMPACT OF THE PILOT

02:11:25.611 --> 02:11:28.647
AND WHAT IS THE FINANCIAL IMPACT

02:11:28.714 --> 02:11:29.881
WHEN IT COMES TO AFFORDABILITY,

02:11:29.948 --> 02:11:33.118
WHEN IT COMES TO DECOUPLING?

02:11:33.185 --> 02:11:38.223
CERTAINLY. SO. THE ARGUMENT FROM

02:11:38.290 --> 02:11:40.559
THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE IS,

02:11:40.626 --> 02:11:42.327
IS, IS A BIT OF A CANARD,

02:11:42.394 --> 02:11:43.929
BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE PILOT

02:11:43.996 --> 02:11:46.765
PROGRAM, IT WAS A TEN YEAR PILOT

02:11:46.832 --> 02:11:49.301
PROGRAM. THAT WAS DURING

02:11:49.368 --> 02:11:50.769
CALIFORNIA'S GREATEST AND MOST

02:11:50.836 --> 02:11:52.571
HISTORIC DROUGHT EVER, WHEN

02:11:52.638 --> 02:11:54.673
WATER COSTS WERE AT AN ALL TIME

02:11:54.740 --> 02:11:56.775
HIGH. DURING MANY OF THOSE

02:11:56.842 --> 02:12:01.947
YEARS, CREDITS WERE GIVEN TO

02:12:02.014 --> 02:12:02.547
RATEPAYERS BECAUSE THERE WERE

02:12:02.614 --> 02:12:04.349
OVER THEY WERE OVER. COLLECTIONS

02:12:04.416 --> 02:12:06.451
AND DECOUPLING WORKED. IF YOU

02:12:06.518 --> 02:12:07.919
LOOK AT IT IN THE AGGREGATE OVER

02:12:07.986 --> 02:12:10.155
THAT TEN YEARS PERIOD OF TIME,

02:12:10.222 --> 02:12:15.627
YES, THERE IS THE TRUE UPS LED

02:12:15.694 --> 02:12:17.062
TO SURCHARGES THAT WERE WERE

02:12:17.129 --> 02:12:18.130
GREATER THAN WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY

02:12:18.196 --> 02:12:20.232
CHARGED TO THE CUSTOMERS. IF

02:12:20.299 --> 02:12:21.667
THAT PILOT PROGRAM HAD BEEN 12

02:12:21.733 --> 02:12:23.769
YEARS, THE NUMBERS WOULD HAVE

02:12:23.835 --> 02:12:24.970
BEEN QUITE DIFFERENT. BECAUSE

02:12:25.037 --> 02:12:27.773
YOU LOOK AT THE INSTANCES I

02:12:27.839 --> 02:12:28.974
EXPLAINED WITH LIKE CAL LAMB,

02:12:29.041 --> 02:12:32.844
WHERE THEY HAD SIGNIFICANT OVER

02:12:32.911 --> 02:12:33.578
COLLECTIONS, THAT WOULD HAVE

02:12:33.645 --> 02:12:36.615
BEEN CREDITED BACK TO, TO THE

02:12:36.682 --> 02:12:38.684
AUTHOR, AND THEN ON THE ON THE

02:12:38.750 --> 02:12:41.520
CONSERVATION ISSUE OR ON THE

02:12:41.586 --> 02:12:44.089
ISSUE OF THAT WAS RAISED BY THE

02:12:44.156 --> 02:12:45.424
FIRST WITNESS IN OPPOSITION

02:12:45.490 --> 02:12:47.259
RELATIVE TO THE FACT THAT A

02:12:47.326 --> 02:12:48.694
CUSTOMER WILL BE CHARGED FOR

02:12:48.760 --> 02:12:50.462
WHAT IS FORECASTED. THE

02:12:50.529 --> 02:12:51.630
ALTERNATIVE. WHAT YOU HAVE TO

02:12:51.697 --> 02:12:54.833
UNDERSTAND IS THE ALTERNATIVE TO

02:12:54.900 --> 02:12:57.336
DECOUPLING IS THE UTILITY HAVING

02:12:57.402 --> 02:12:59.171
TO CHARGE A SIGNIFICANT FIXED

02:12:59.237 --> 02:13:02.774
CHARGE TO ALL CUSTOMERS. FIXED

02:13:02.841 --> 02:13:04.843
COSTS AVERAGE ABOUT 70% OF THE

02:13:04.910 --> 02:13:07.412
TOTAL COSTS OF A WATER UTILITY,

02:13:07.479 --> 02:13:09.848
70%. IF YOU DON'T HAVE

02:13:09.915 --> 02:13:11.416
DECOUPLING, WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS

02:13:11.483 --> 02:13:13.852
THE UTILITY IN ORDER TO HEDGE

02:13:13.919 --> 02:13:15.220
AGAINST RISK, AND THE EXPOSURE

02:13:15.287 --> 02:13:17.889
OF THIS VOLATILITY WILL ADOPT A

02:13:17.956 --> 02:13:19.991
VERY SIGNIFICANT FIXED CHARGE

02:13:20.058 --> 02:13:21.793
THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY HITS

02:13:21.860 --> 02:13:24.563
LOW. LOW INCOME, LOW WATER

02:13:24.629 --> 02:13:27.966
USERS. SO BY HAVING DECOUPLING,

02:13:28.033 --> 02:13:29.634
THAT ENABLES A MORE DYNAMIC

02:13:29.701 --> 02:13:31.703
TIERED STRUCTURE THAT ACTUALLY

02:13:31.770 --> 02:13:32.971
LOWERS RATES FOR THOSE FOLKS AT

02:13:33.038 --> 02:13:35.107
THE LOWER END OF THE ROMNEY. DO

02:13:35.173 --> 02:13:36.508
YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING TO

02:13:36.575 --> 02:13:37.876
THAT? NO, I THINK YOU ANSWERED

02:13:37.943 --> 02:13:39.444
THAT VERY WELL. AND I'LL JUST

02:13:39.511 --> 02:13:40.879
SAY THAT ON THE FORECAST FOR

02:13:40.946 --> 02:13:43.281
WATER UTILITY USAGE, THAT IS A

02:13:43.348 --> 02:13:45.183
FORECAST THAT'S ADOPTED BY THE

02:13:45.250 --> 02:13:47.652
CPUC. THAT'S NOT A, YOU KNOW,

02:13:47.719 --> 02:13:49.020
UTILITIES FORECAST, THE PUBLIC

02:13:49.087 --> 02:13:50.589
ADVOCATE'S FORECAST, BUT THE

02:13:50.655 --> 02:13:53.392
FORECAST IS ADOPTED BY THE CPC.

02:13:53.458 --> 02:13:55.293
THANK YOU. AND I JUST ALSO POINT

02:13:55.360 --> 02:13:57.195
OUT THAT IN THE BILL, I READ THE

02:13:57.262 --> 02:13:58.830
THREE SECTIONS THAT AB

02:13:58.897 --> 02:14:00.699
ABSOLUTELY, CATEGORICALLY

02:14:00.766 --> 02:14:02.801
ESTABLISHED THAT THERE CAN BE NO

02:14:02.868 --> 02:14:04.836
OVER COLLECTIONS WHATSOEVER. SO

02:14:04.903 --> 02:14:07.205
IF YOU HAVE AN ISSUE, IF THEY

02:14:07.272 --> 02:14:09.908
HAVE AN ISSUE WITH WHAT THE

02:14:09.975 --> 02:14:11.943
REVENUE LIMIT IS SET, THAT'S TO

02:14:12.010 --> 02:14:12.911
BE DETERMINED THROUGH THE

02:14:12.978 --> 02:14:14.413
GENERAL RATE CASE. AND THAT'S

02:14:14.479 --> 02:14:17.349
WHAT THE PUC, THE COMPANY GETS

02:14:17.416 --> 02:14:19.384
WHAT THE PUC GIVES TO THEM. AND

02:14:19.451 --> 02:14:20.919
NOW THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT

02:14:20.986 --> 02:14:22.754
THERE ARE NO OVER COLLECTIONS,

02:14:22.821 --> 02:14:24.856
WHICH IS NOT THE CASE TODAY. WE

02:14:24.923 --> 02:14:26.358
JUST HAD A CASE WHERE COLUMN

02:14:26.425 --> 02:14:31.296
OVER COLLECTED BY 21, ALMOST $21

02:14:31.363 --> 02:14:32.664
MILLION. AND THAT SHOULD HAVE

02:14:32.731 --> 02:14:34.900
BEEN COULD HAVE BEEN RETURNED TO

02:14:34.966 --> 02:14:37.469
THE RATEPAYERS. WITH THIS BILL.

02:14:37.536 --> 02:14:39.571
IT WILL BE BACK. RIGHT. THANK

02:14:39.638 --> 02:14:41.106
YOU, MADAM CHAIR. I APPRECIATE

02:14:41.173 --> 02:14:43.108
THE ANSWERS AND I DO APPRECIATE

02:14:43.175 --> 02:14:45.677
SENATOR P COMING DOWN TO PRESENT

02:14:45.744 --> 02:14:47.112
THIS BILL. I THINK IT'S A GOOD

02:14:47.179 --> 02:14:50.115
BILL AND IT HELPS FOR AT LEAST

02:14:50.182 --> 02:14:50.882
FOR CONSTITUENTS IN MY DISTRICT

02:14:50.949 --> 02:14:52.584
AS WELL. SO WITH THAT, IF IT

02:14:52.651 --> 02:14:53.952
HASN'T BEEN MOVED, I'LL BE HAPPY

02:14:54.019 --> 02:14:56.154
TO MOVE THE BILL. SECOND

02:14:56.221 --> 02:14:59.324
ASSEMBLYMEMBERS I THINK MY

02:14:59.391 --> 02:15:00.759
COLLEAGUE ASKED SOME OF THE

02:15:00.826 --> 02:15:02.093
QUESTIONS THAT I HAD. I THINK

02:15:02.160 --> 02:15:03.395
THE OTHER QUESTION I WOULD

02:15:03.462 --> 02:15:07.265
ACTUALLY ASK IS. WHAT THIS DOES

02:15:07.332 --> 02:15:09.801
IN TERMS OF CONSERVATION. IF YOU

02:15:09.868 --> 02:15:11.603
COULD SORT OF ADDRESS ADDRESS

02:15:11.670 --> 02:15:15.474
THAT. SO THE WAY TO THE WAY TO

02:15:15.540 --> 02:15:17.108
AND BY THE WAY, THE DATA IS

02:15:17.175 --> 02:15:19.177
CLEAR. WE'VE GIVEN THIS TO YOUR

02:15:19.244 --> 02:15:19.945
OFFICES DURING THAT TEN YEAR

02:15:20.011 --> 02:15:22.414
PILOT PROGRAM. WHEN YOU LOOK AT

02:15:22.481 --> 02:15:23.748
THE FOUR REGULATED UTILITIES

02:15:23.815 --> 02:15:25.250
THAT DID NOT DECOUPLE, AND YOU

02:15:25.317 --> 02:15:27.486
LOOK AT THE FOUR THAT DID, THE

02:15:27.552 --> 02:15:29.187
FOUR THAT DID HAD SIGNIFICANTLY

02:15:29.254 --> 02:15:30.222
HIGHER CONSERVATION RATES,

02:15:30.288 --> 02:15:32.190
THAT'S A PART THAT'S A MATTER OF

02:15:32.257 --> 02:15:35.660
THE RECORD. SO THE WAY YOU

02:15:35.727 --> 02:15:37.829
AFFECT CONSERVATION IN WATER IS

02:15:37.896 --> 02:15:40.699
THROUGH AGGRESSIVE TIERED RATES.

02:15:40.765 --> 02:15:44.069
IF YOU USE MORE, YOU PAY MORE.

02:15:44.135 --> 02:15:46.104
THAT'S WHY FOR LOWER INCOME,

02:15:46.171 --> 02:15:47.873
MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WHO

02:15:47.939 --> 02:15:49.541
ARE MORE COST CONSCIOUS, THEY

02:15:49.608 --> 02:15:51.176
DON'T WASH THREE CARS, THEY

02:15:51.243 --> 02:15:52.677
DON'T HAVE A SWIMMING POOL, THEY

02:15:52.744 --> 02:15:55.080
DON'T HAVE A LOT OF LANDSCAPING.

02:15:55.146 --> 02:15:56.381
THEY SEE A BENEFIT FOR FOLKS

02:15:56.448 --> 02:15:58.717
LIKE THE KIM KARDASHIANS, WHO

02:15:58.783 --> 02:16:00.685
SPEND LAVISHLY ON THEIR WATER

02:16:00.752 --> 02:16:02.420
AND DON'T CARE, THEY PAY THE

02:16:02.487 --> 02:16:05.290
HIGHEST RATE. THE PROBLEM IS, IF

02:16:05.357 --> 02:16:07.325
YOU DON'T HAVE DECOUPLING THE

02:16:07.392 --> 02:16:09.561
RISK IN THE EXPOSURE OF THAT

02:16:09.628 --> 02:16:11.763
VOLATILITY, VOLATILITY TO THE

02:16:11.830 --> 02:16:14.299
UTILITY IS SO GREAT THAT THEY

02:16:14.366 --> 02:16:17.502
HAVE TO HEDGE BY BY PUTTING A

02:16:17.569 --> 02:16:19.070
LARGE FIXED CHARGE, RIGHT,

02:16:19.137 --> 02:16:20.939
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GO OUT AND DO

02:16:21.006 --> 02:16:22.841
ALL THE THINGS THEY NEED TO DO,

02:16:22.908 --> 02:16:24.676
AND THEN FIND OUT THAT THEY

02:16:24.743 --> 02:16:25.343
UNDER COLLECTED BY $30 MILLION,

02:16:25.410 --> 02:16:26.878
THEY'D BE OUT OF BUSINESS FAIRLY

02:16:26.945 --> 02:16:28.647
QUICKLY SO THAT THEY HAVE TO

02:16:28.713 --> 02:16:29.881
RELY ON A FIXED CHARGE. IF YOU

02:16:29.948 --> 02:16:31.950
HAVE DECOUPLING AS YOUR

02:16:32.017 --> 02:16:32.984
BACKSTOP, BECAUSE YOU KNOW

02:16:33.051 --> 02:16:34.486
YOU'RE GOING TO GUARANTEED GET

02:16:34.553 --> 02:16:36.187
WHATEVER THE PUC SAID YOU COULD

02:16:36.254 --> 02:16:37.689
COLLECT, THEN YOU CAN BE

02:16:37.756 --> 02:16:40.892
AGGRESSIVE IN THOSE TIERS. AND

02:16:40.959 --> 02:16:41.593
THAT'S WHAT LEADS TO

02:16:41.660 --> 02:16:45.931
CONSERVATION. THANK YOU.

02:16:45.997 --> 02:16:48.800
ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA. THANK

02:16:48.867 --> 02:16:52.837
YOU, MADAM CHAIR. IT'S WORKING

02:16:52.904 --> 02:16:54.906
WITH OR WITHOUT A BUTTON.

02:16:54.973 --> 02:16:58.143
ANYWAY, IT'S JUST A HOT MIC.

02:16:58.209 --> 02:17:00.178
THANK YOU. THANK YOU, MADAM

02:17:00.245 --> 02:17:02.280
CHAIR. A QUESTION OF THE PUBLIC

02:17:02.347 --> 02:17:03.949
ADVOCATE, BECAUSE THERE SEEMS,

02:17:04.015 --> 02:17:06.418
YOU KNOW, THERE SEEMS TO BE.

02:17:06.484 --> 02:17:07.552
IT'S ONE THING TO HAVE AN

02:17:07.619 --> 02:17:09.721
OPINION ON POLICY, BUT ON THE

02:17:09.788 --> 02:17:11.890
FACTS, I THINK THAT WE JUST WANT

02:17:11.957 --> 02:17:13.892
TO MAKE CLEAR ON THE FACTS. SO

02:17:13.959 --> 02:17:17.329
ACCORDING TO THE DATA OVER THE

02:17:17.395 --> 02:17:20.131
TEN YEAR PERIOD WHERE YOU HAD

02:17:20.198 --> 02:17:23.868
BOTH THE RAM AND THE CART, THE

02:17:23.935 --> 02:17:25.971
THIS IS BASICALLY THE CHART IS

02:17:26.037 --> 02:17:26.972
BASICALLY TRYING TO INDICATE

02:17:27.038 --> 02:17:29.107
THAT IT WAS ESSENTIALLY SIMILAR

02:17:29.174 --> 02:17:35.680
IN TERMS OF CONSUMPTION AND.

02:17:35.747 --> 02:17:37.082
THE, THE BILLION DOLLARS, SO

02:17:37.148 --> 02:17:40.085
THAT THAT IS JUST THOSE EXTRA

02:17:40.151 --> 02:17:41.386
SURCHARGES THAT OCCURRED FROM

02:17:41.453 --> 02:17:43.955
THE RAM VERSUS CART OVER THE TEN

02:17:44.022 --> 02:17:46.057
YEARS. THAT AND THAT'S THE

02:17:46.124 --> 02:17:48.960
ARGUMENT AS TO WHY I'M PRESUMING

02:17:49.027 --> 02:17:52.330
THE CPUC DECIDED TO MOVE AWAY

02:17:52.397 --> 02:17:56.134
FROM IT BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T SEE

02:17:56.201 --> 02:17:57.369
CONSUMPTION CHANGES, BUT THEY

02:17:57.435 --> 02:17:59.771
SAW RATE INCREASES. CORRECT. SO

02:17:59.838 --> 02:18:01.606
NOW IT'S BEEN FIVE YEARS SINCE

02:18:01.673 --> 02:18:03.541
THEN. WHAT DATA, IF ANY? OR CAN

02:18:03.608 --> 02:18:06.378
WE EXTRAPOLATE THAT IF THESE TWO

02:18:06.444 --> 02:18:08.079
METHODS WERE PUT IN PLACE, AS

02:18:08.146 --> 02:18:10.582
ANYONE DONE THAT DATA TO SAY,

02:18:10.649 --> 02:18:12.217
HEY, IF THESE TWO SYSTEMS WERE

02:18:12.283 --> 02:18:14.486
STILL IN PLACE OVER THE LAST

02:18:14.552 --> 02:18:16.054
FIVE YEARS, THIS IS WHAT WOULD

02:18:16.121 --> 02:18:18.189
HAVE HAPPENED, BECAUSE MR. WELCH

02:18:18.256 --> 02:18:19.724
IS INDICATING THE ANOMALY BASED

02:18:19.791 --> 02:18:20.825
UPON DROUGHT CONDITIONS. WHAT

02:18:20.892 --> 02:18:23.895
HAVE YOU IS THERE ANY IS ANY

02:18:23.962 --> 02:18:25.630
DATA BEEN DONE IN TERMS OF

02:18:25.697 --> 02:18:26.731
EXTRAPOLATING THE LAST FIVE

02:18:26.798 --> 02:18:27.899
YEARS, AS IF THOSE TWO SYSTEMS

02:18:27.966 --> 02:18:30.201
STILL EXISTED IN THOSE DIFFERENT

02:18:30.268 --> 02:18:32.570
LARGE UTILITIES? IT'S OKAY.

02:18:32.637 --> 02:18:35.440
RICHARD. YES, AND I'LL HEAR FROM

02:18:35.507 --> 02:18:36.474
EITHER, BUT YES, CERTAINLY

02:18:36.541 --> 02:18:37.642
PUBLIC ADVOCATES FIRST AND WE

02:18:37.709 --> 02:18:39.577
CAN HEAR. THANK YOU. SO THAT'S A

02:18:39.644 --> 02:18:40.578
GREAT QUESTION. AND I'LL, I'LL

02:18:40.645 --> 02:18:43.014
TAKE THE FIRST STAB AT IT FIRST.

02:18:43.081 --> 02:18:44.783
YOU'RE RIGHT. AS THE CHART THAT

02:18:44.849 --> 02:18:45.884
WE'VE CIRCULATED SHOWS, THERE

02:18:45.950 --> 02:18:47.185
WAS VIRTUALLY NO DIFFERENCE IN

02:18:47.252 --> 02:18:48.820
THE CONSERVATION LEVELS BETWEEN

02:18:48.887 --> 02:18:50.789
THE FULL RAM AND THE CART, WHICH

02:18:50.855 --> 02:18:52.624
WAS THE SOFTER APPROACH TO RAM,

02:18:52.691 --> 02:18:55.060
IF YOU WILL. ADDITIONALLY, UPON

02:18:55.126 --> 02:18:57.095
COMPLETION OF THE TEN YEAR PILOT

02:18:57.162 --> 02:18:58.863
PROGRAM, THE WATER UTILITIES WHO

02:18:58.930 --> 02:19:00.832
WERE FULL RAM THEIR OWN

02:19:00.899 --> 02:19:02.367
CONSULTANTS AND DATA THAT WAS

02:19:02.434 --> 02:19:05.136
SUBMITTED TO THE CPUC ADMITTED

02:19:05.203 --> 02:19:06.571
THAT THE DATA SUPPORTING THE

02:19:06.638 --> 02:19:08.339
ARGUMENT THAT THEIR EFFORTS WERE

02:19:08.406 --> 02:19:10.175
SUPPORTIVE AND HELPED WITH

02:19:10.241 --> 02:19:11.876
CONSERVATION WERE INCONCLUSIVE.

02:19:11.943 --> 02:19:14.612
IN OTHER WORDS, THERE WAS NO WAY

02:19:14.679 --> 02:19:15.213
TO PROVE DEFINITIVELY WHETHER

02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:16.614
THIS WOULD HELP OR HURT WITH

02:19:16.681 --> 02:19:17.849
CONSERVATION. AND I JUST ALSO

02:19:17.916 --> 02:19:20.118
WANT TO ADD THAT OVER THE LAST

02:19:20.185 --> 02:19:21.052
SEVERAL YEARS, WATER UTILITIES

02:19:21.119 --> 02:19:23.521
HAVE HAD MULTIPLE OPPORTUNITIES

02:19:23.588 --> 02:19:25.724
TO APPLY FOR. I JUST WANT TO BE

02:19:25.790 --> 02:19:27.192
CLEAR, NOTHING IN THE LAW

02:19:27.258 --> 02:19:28.326
PROHIBITS WATER UTILITIES FROM

02:19:28.393 --> 02:19:30.295
APPLYING FOR RAM. TO DATE, NO

02:19:30.361 --> 02:19:32.130
WATER UTILITY HAS BEEN

02:19:32.197 --> 02:19:33.498
SUCCESSFUL IN MAKING THE CASE

02:19:33.565 --> 02:19:35.867
THAT RAM WOULD ASSIST WITH

02:19:35.934 --> 02:19:37.736
CONSERVATION AND FUNDING

02:19:37.802 --> 02:19:38.536
REVENUES. AND MY COLLEAGUE

02:19:38.603 --> 02:19:40.905
PROBABLY CAN SPEAK A LITTLE BIT

02:19:40.972 --> 02:19:42.841
MORE. AND BEFORE HE DOES ON THAT

02:19:42.907 --> 02:19:43.875
POINT AND THE ANALYSIS WAS

02:19:43.942 --> 02:19:46.311
EXCELLENT AND READ IT A COUPLE

02:19:46.377 --> 02:19:47.378
OF TIMES, THE IT SEEMS LIKE

02:19:47.445 --> 02:19:49.914
THERE WAS AN EFFORT BY THE CPUC

02:19:49.981 --> 02:19:51.182
JUST TO PHASE OUT RAM

02:19:51.249 --> 02:19:52.050
ALTOGETHER, NOT PHASE IT OUT,

02:19:52.117 --> 02:19:54.219
JUST END IT. THERE WAS

02:19:54.285 --> 02:19:56.254
LITIGATION AND THE COURTS

02:19:56.321 --> 02:19:57.989
INDICATED, WELL, THE UTILITIES

02:19:58.056 --> 02:20:01.426
HAVE THE RIGHT TO PROSPECTIVELY,

02:20:01.493 --> 02:20:03.228
THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO COME TO

02:20:03.294 --> 02:20:04.662
THE CPUC AND MAKE THAT CASE. AND

02:20:04.729 --> 02:20:06.030
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO,

02:20:06.097 --> 02:20:07.298
IS THOSE EFFORTS TO MAKE THE

02:20:07.365 --> 02:20:09.601
CASE. NONE OF THEM HAVE BEEN

02:20:09.667 --> 02:20:10.068
APPROVED BY THE CPUC.

02:20:10.135 --> 02:20:11.102
ABSOLUTELY. AND THIS BILL WOULD

02:20:11.169 --> 02:20:12.504
OVERTURN ALL OF THOSE CASES,

02:20:12.570 --> 02:20:14.973
FOUR OF WHICH WERE MADE IN THE

02:20:15.039 --> 02:20:16.541
LAST YEAR ALONE. OKAY. AND MORE

02:20:16.608 --> 02:20:19.144
INFO OR AND THEN WE CAN GO TO

02:20:19.210 --> 02:20:21.212
THE SUPPORT SESSION. CAN I

02:20:21.279 --> 02:20:21.980
BORROW YOUR MICROPHONE FOR A

02:20:22.046 --> 02:20:24.649
SECOND? OH, YEAH. EXCUSE ME.

02:20:24.716 --> 02:20:28.953
YEAH. RESPOND TO YOUR QUESTION.

02:20:29.020 --> 02:20:30.655
YEAH. ACTUALLY I'M GOING TO

02:20:30.722 --> 02:20:33.224
AGREE WITH A COUPLE OF THE

02:20:33.291 --> 02:20:34.058
THINGS THAT YOU HEARD THAT

02:20:34.125 --> 02:20:35.593
DURING THE PILOT STUDY, THERE

02:20:35.660 --> 02:20:37.662
WERE SOME YEARS OF DROUGHT. AND

02:20:37.729 --> 02:20:39.764
IT'S BEEN EXPLAINED THAT THAT

02:20:39.831 --> 02:20:42.100
SOMEHOW SKEWED THE RESULTS AND

02:20:42.167 --> 02:20:44.536
MADE THINGS WHAT THEY WOULD

02:20:44.602 --> 02:20:46.337
OTHERWISE BE. AND I WOULD JUST

02:20:46.404 --> 02:20:49.207
ASK YOU THAT, WOULDN'T YOU WANT

02:20:49.274 --> 02:20:52.777
A CONSERVATION MECHANISM TO WORK

02:20:52.844 --> 02:20:55.313
ITS BEST DURING A TIME OF

02:20:55.380 --> 02:20:58.249
DROUGHT? THAT'S WHEN YOU REALLY

02:20:58.316 --> 02:20:59.717
NEED IT. IN TERMS OF THE OTHER

02:20:59.784 --> 02:21:00.985
THING THAT I HEARD ABOUT THE WAY

02:21:01.052 --> 02:21:02.520
YOU EFFECTUATE CONSERVATION WITH

02:21:02.587 --> 02:21:05.824
AGGRESSIVE RATE DESIGN, THAT IS

02:21:05.890 --> 02:21:08.326
EXACTLY THE MECHANISM THAT THE

02:21:08.393 --> 02:21:09.861
COMMISSION ADOPTED IN PLACE OF

02:21:09.928 --> 02:21:11.563
THE FULL REVENUE DECOUPLING. THE

02:21:11.629 --> 02:21:14.399
CART MECHANISM IS SPECIFICALLY

02:21:14.465 --> 02:21:17.302
DESIGNED TO COMPENSATE UTILITIES

02:21:17.368 --> 02:21:19.871
SPECIFICALLY FOR THE EFFECTS OF

02:21:19.938 --> 02:21:21.139
AGGRESSIVE RATE DESIGN, WHICH

02:21:21.206 --> 02:21:23.141
YOU JUST HEARD IS THE WAY TO

02:21:23.208 --> 02:21:25.143
EFFECTUATE CONSERVATION. BY

02:21:25.210 --> 02:21:26.911
CONTRAST, THE FULL REVENUE RAM

02:21:26.978 --> 02:21:29.180
THAT THE COMMISSION ELIMINATED

02:21:29.247 --> 02:21:31.149
OR TRANSITIONED AWAY FROM IS A

02:21:31.216 --> 02:21:34.352
VERY BLUNT INSTRUMENT. IT CANNOT

02:21:34.419 --> 02:21:36.688
DISCERN WHETHER ECONOMICS

02:21:36.754 --> 02:21:37.689
CONSERVATION. AS A MATTER OF

02:21:37.755 --> 02:21:39.390
FACT, THE MINUTE WHEN THEY

02:21:39.457 --> 02:21:41.159
IMPLEMENTED IT IN 2008, RIGHT

02:21:41.226 --> 02:21:42.760
AROUND THE GREAT RECESSION, WE

02:21:42.827 --> 02:21:45.029
SAW A LOT OF HOMES GO INTO

02:21:45.096 --> 02:21:46.464
FORECLOSURE. THOSE HOMES WERE

02:21:46.531 --> 02:21:50.034
NOT USING WATER. THIS MECHANISM

02:21:50.101 --> 02:21:51.502
REWARDED THE UTILITIES FOR THE

02:21:51.569 --> 02:21:52.837
GREAT CONSERVATION THAT WAS

02:21:52.904 --> 02:21:54.706
BEING DONE, BECAUSE IT WAS

02:21:54.772 --> 02:21:57.542
UNABLE TO DISCERN CONSERVATION

02:21:57.609 --> 02:22:01.279
FROM FORECLOSURE, WEATHER

02:22:01.346 --> 02:22:02.881
ECONOMICS. AND THAT IS PRECISELY

02:22:02.947 --> 02:22:05.850
WHY THE CPUC, IN MULTIPLE

02:22:05.917 --> 02:22:07.886
PROCEEDINGS STUDYING THE RECORD,

02:22:07.952 --> 02:22:09.988
STUDYING THE HISTORY, STUDYING

02:22:10.054 --> 02:22:12.357
THE PILOT PROJECT RESULTS,

02:22:12.423 --> 02:22:13.858
DECIDED TO GO AWAY FROM THE FULL

02:22:13.925 --> 02:22:16.661
REVENUE DECOUPLING TOWARDS THE

02:22:16.728 --> 02:22:19.130
OTHER CONSERVATION ADJUSTMENT

02:22:19.197 --> 02:22:21.699
RATE PRICE DECOUPLING MECHANISM,

02:22:21.766 --> 02:22:24.269
AND HAS DONE SO IN THE LAST FOUR

02:22:24.335 --> 02:22:26.471
PROCEEDINGS THAT ANNABELLE

02:22:26.537 --> 02:22:27.772
MENTIONED. MR. THANK YOU.

02:22:27.839 --> 02:22:30.975
COMMENT. THANK YOU. CHAIR. AND

02:22:31.042 --> 02:22:34.045
IF AND I'LL HAVE MY COUNTERPART

02:22:34.112 --> 02:22:35.446
HERE RESPOND AS WELL. FIRST OF

02:22:35.513 --> 02:22:37.215
ALL, THE DATA IS ABSOLUTELY

02:22:37.282 --> 02:22:38.783
CLEAR DURING THE PILOT PROJECT

02:22:38.850 --> 02:22:40.718
THAT THE DECOUPLED COMPANIES HAD

02:22:40.785 --> 02:22:42.720
A HIGHER RATE OF CONSERVATION

02:22:42.787 --> 02:22:44.355
THAN THE NON. AND WE PROVIDED

02:22:44.422 --> 02:22:45.323
THAT TO EVERYBODY. IT'S

02:22:45.390 --> 02:22:47.959
DOCUMENTED. WE WE'VE SHARED THAT

02:22:48.026 --> 02:22:49.961
AGAIN THIS MISNOMER THAT THERE

02:22:50.028 --> 02:22:53.031
WAS A RATE INCREASE. THE PUC

02:22:53.097 --> 02:22:56.868
APPROVES THE REVENUE LIMIT FOR A

02:22:56.935 --> 02:23:00.138
WATER UTILITY. IT WAS A FACTOR

02:23:00.204 --> 02:23:02.006
OF AN UNDER-COLLECTION AND THEN

02:23:02.073 --> 02:23:04.776
A, A SURCHARGE APPLIED. IN MANY

02:23:04.842 --> 02:23:06.778
OF THOSE YEARS THE OPPOSITE

02:23:06.844 --> 02:23:07.845
HAPPENED. THERE WAS A CREDIT

02:23:07.912 --> 02:23:09.847
THAT WAS APPROVED, BUT IT WASN'T

02:23:09.914 --> 02:23:10.982
A RATE INCREASE. THE RATE

02:23:11.049 --> 02:23:12.216
INCREASE WAS APPROVED. THE RATE

02:23:12.283 --> 02:23:14.218
WAS APPROVED BY THE COMMISSION.

02:23:14.285 --> 02:23:15.787
IT WAS A MATTER OF COLLECTION.

02:23:15.853 --> 02:23:17.188
THIS AFFECTED BY SEVERAL

02:23:17.255 --> 02:23:19.657
DIFFERENT FACTORS. BUT AS FAR AS

02:23:19.724 --> 02:23:22.160
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO

02:23:22.226 --> 02:23:24.462
DIFFERENT RATE DESIGNS, I'LL LET

02:23:24.529 --> 02:23:27.432
THE FORMER HEAD OF THE DIVISION

02:23:27.498 --> 02:23:28.099
SPEAK TO THAT. YEAH, THANK YOU.

02:23:28.166 --> 02:23:29.534
AND THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

02:23:29.600 --> 02:23:30.868
SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S DIFFICULT TO

02:23:30.935 --> 02:23:31.569
ANSWER YOUR QUESTION BECAUSE

02:23:31.636 --> 02:23:32.971
IT'S SORT OF A HYPOTHETICAL. WE

02:23:33.037 --> 02:23:34.839
DON'T HAVE FULL DECOUPLING FOR

02:23:34.906 --> 02:23:36.741
THE LAST FIVE YEARS, SO WE DON'T

02:23:36.808 --> 02:23:38.943
HAVE THAT. SO WE CAN'T DO THAT

02:23:39.010 --> 02:23:39.744
COMPARISON. BUT I CAN TELL YOU

02:23:39.811 --> 02:23:41.312
DURING THE LAST GREAT DROUGHT,

02:23:41.379 --> 02:23:42.880
WHEN THE FIRST TIME IN

02:23:42.947 --> 02:23:44.182
CALIFORNIA HISTORY, THE GOVERNOR

02:23:44.248 --> 02:23:46.751
SAID YOU NEED TO SAVE 25% OF

02:23:46.818 --> 02:23:48.619
WATER, EVERY ONE OF OUR INVESTOR

02:23:48.686 --> 02:23:50.288
OWNED UTILITIES UNDER MY

02:23:50.355 --> 02:23:52.890
DIRECTION AT THE CPUC HIT THEIR

02:23:52.957 --> 02:23:54.359
WATER USE REDUCTIONS, AND THEY

02:23:54.425 --> 02:23:56.394
WERE ABLE TO HIT THOSE WATER USE

02:23:56.461 --> 02:23:57.862
REDUCTIONS BECAUSE THEY ALL HAD

02:23:57.929 --> 02:23:59.831
FULL DECOUPLING. YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:23:59.897 --> 02:24:01.165
THOSE CHARTS WON'T SHOW YOU THAT

02:24:01.232 --> 02:24:04.002
THOSE EMMERAM COMPANIES NON-FULL

02:24:04.068 --> 02:24:06.104
DECOUPLING COMPANIES. WHEN THE

02:24:06.170 --> 02:24:07.572
GOVERNOR DECLARES A DROUGHT AND

02:24:07.638 --> 02:24:09.540
ONLY THE GOVERNOR CAN DECLARE A

02:24:09.607 --> 02:24:11.109
DROUGHT, AND WHEN IT'S OVER,

02:24:11.175 --> 02:24:12.443
THEY ESSENTIALLY HAVE FULL

02:24:12.510 --> 02:24:13.745
DECOUPLING THROUGH ANOTHER

02:24:13.811 --> 02:24:15.580
MECHANISM THAT THE CPUC ALLOWS.

02:24:15.646 --> 02:24:17.348
AND IN TERMS OF AGGRESSIVE RATE

02:24:17.415 --> 02:24:18.783
DESIGNS, THE RATE DESIGNS ARE

02:24:18.850 --> 02:24:20.084
NEVER MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN THEY

02:24:20.151 --> 02:24:21.686
ARE UNDER FULL DECOUPLING. WHAT

02:24:21.753 --> 02:24:23.855
WE HAVE SEEN IN THESE LAST FIVE

02:24:23.921 --> 02:24:25.123
YEARS IS THE RATE DESIGNS

02:24:25.189 --> 02:24:27.692
GETTING LESS AGGRESSIVE, WHERE

02:24:27.759 --> 02:24:29.560
LOW INCOME, LOW USER CUSTOMERS

02:24:29.627 --> 02:24:31.062
ARE HAVING A HIGHER SERVICE

02:24:31.129 --> 02:24:33.231
CHARGE. THAT'S WHAT YOU PAY FOR

02:24:33.297 --> 02:24:35.767
THE BEFORE YOU USE ANY WATER AND

02:24:35.833 --> 02:24:37.402
HIGHER VOLUMETRIC CHARGES. SO

02:24:37.468 --> 02:24:39.037
YEAH, I WILL DISAGREE WITH MY

02:24:39.103 --> 02:24:40.972
COLLEAGUES. AND TO THAT POINT

02:24:41.039 --> 02:24:42.507
DURING THE DURING THE DROUGHT

02:24:42.573 --> 02:24:43.741
WHERE THERE EMERGENCY MEASURES

02:24:43.808 --> 02:24:48.746
THAT ALLOWED THE CART UTILITIES

02:24:48.813 --> 02:24:53.718
TO OPERATE MORE AS RAM. SO YES.

02:24:53.785 --> 02:24:56.120
AND THAT CONTINUES THAT ANY

02:24:56.187 --> 02:24:58.756
UTILITY WITH A CART MECHANISM AT

02:24:58.823 --> 02:25:00.892
A PERIOD OF DROUGHT OR WHEN

02:25:00.958 --> 02:25:03.661
THERE IS REAL NEED FOR

02:25:03.728 --> 02:25:05.963
CONSERVATION, THOSE MECHANISMS

02:25:06.030 --> 02:25:07.999
ACCOMMODATE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

02:25:08.066 --> 02:25:09.867
THERE. THERE ARE SOME SUBTLE

02:25:09.934 --> 02:25:11.469
CHANGES IN TERMS OF HOW THEY

02:25:11.536 --> 02:25:13.137
OPERATE, IN TERMS OF THE PROFIT

02:25:13.204 --> 02:25:15.039
THAT A UTILITY IS ALLOWED AND

02:25:15.106 --> 02:25:16.707
THE ADJUSTMENT THAT NEEDS TO BE

02:25:16.774 --> 02:25:18.776
MADE. BUT YOU'RE CORRECT SO THAT

02:25:18.843 --> 02:25:20.778
AT TIMES OF DROUGHT. SO TO THIS

02:25:20.845 --> 02:25:22.980
DAY, IF THERE IS A DROUGHT, THEY

02:25:23.047 --> 02:25:23.848
CAN ACTUALLY OPERATE IN THAT

02:25:23.915 --> 02:25:25.683
SAME MECHANISM. THEY CAN OPERATE

02:25:25.750 --> 02:25:28.653
SIMILARLY TO RAM DURING CURRENT

02:25:28.719 --> 02:25:30.221
DROUGHT CONDITIONS IF THEY OCCUR

02:25:30.288 --> 02:25:33.324
NOW. CORRECT. AND THEN THE LAST

02:25:33.391 --> 02:25:34.692
QUESTION I HAVE, I DON'T ALWAYS

02:25:34.759 --> 02:25:36.661
ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS HERE, BUT

02:25:36.727 --> 02:25:38.729
THIS IS ACTUALLY I REALLY AM

02:25:38.796 --> 02:25:39.497
KIND OF DEBATING IN MY MIND

02:25:39.564 --> 02:25:41.265
EXACTLY ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE

02:25:41.332 --> 02:25:42.266
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE,

02:25:42.333 --> 02:25:43.301
SENATOR, THAT YOU'RE BRINGING

02:25:43.367 --> 02:25:44.469
FORWARD. BUT IT'S ALSO A LITTLE

02:25:44.535 --> 02:25:45.970
COMPLEX TO UNDERSTAND THE MANNER

02:25:46.037 --> 02:25:48.940
IN WHICH IT'S BEEN ANALYZED ON.

02:25:49.006 --> 02:25:52.643
THERE'S BEEN SUGGESTIONS BY THE

02:25:52.710 --> 02:25:55.279
SUPPORT WITNESSES THAT THE RATES

02:25:55.346 --> 02:25:58.549
ARE SET BY THE CPUC. WHAT ROLE,

02:25:58.616 --> 02:26:00.885
IF ANY, DOES UTILITIES PLAY IN

02:26:00.952 --> 02:26:02.153
THAT RATE SETTING? IN OTHER

02:26:02.220 --> 02:26:04.689
WORDS, HOW MUCH DO THEY RELY ON

02:26:04.755 --> 02:26:05.690
WHAT UTILITIES ARE EITHER ASKING

02:26:05.756 --> 02:26:07.358
FOR OR INFORMATION THEY'RE

02:26:07.425 --> 02:26:08.326
PROVIDING? JUST KIND OF WHAT

02:26:08.392 --> 02:26:13.598
WHAT IS THAT RELATIONSHIP? THAT

02:26:13.664 --> 02:26:15.032
WAS THE QUESTION. AND THIS WILL

02:26:15.099 --> 02:26:17.235
BE MY LAST QUESTION. SORRY,

02:26:17.301 --> 02:26:19.170
ASSEMBLY MEMBER, WHO WOULD YOU

02:26:19.237 --> 02:26:19.904
LIKE TO RESPOND TO THAT

02:26:19.971 --> 02:26:21.038
QUESTION? I WAS ASKING THE

02:26:21.105 --> 02:26:22.507
PUBLIC ADVOCATE IF THERE'S A

02:26:22.573 --> 02:26:23.841
RESPONSE BACK, I'M OKAY WITH

02:26:23.908 --> 02:26:25.076
THAT. ALL RIGHT. LET'S HEAR

02:26:25.143 --> 02:26:26.110
FIRST FROM THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE.

02:26:26.177 --> 02:26:28.646
YES. SO IN THE CASE OF THE CLASS

02:26:28.713 --> 02:26:29.780
A WATER UTILITIES, THE LARGE

02:26:29.847 --> 02:26:30.581
WATER UTILITIES THAT WE'RE

02:26:30.648 --> 02:26:31.849
SPEAKING ABOUT NOW, THERE IS A

02:26:31.916 --> 02:26:33.851
RATE CASE PLAN. EVERY THREE

02:26:33.918 --> 02:26:35.887
YEARS THEY COME IN, THEY FILE A

02:26:35.953 --> 02:26:37.421
GENERAL RATE CASE. THERE'S A

02:26:37.488 --> 02:26:39.957
ROBUST EVIDENTIARY RECORD. THESE

02:26:40.024 --> 02:26:41.993
ISSUES ARE VETTED WITHIN THAT.

02:26:42.059 --> 02:26:44.495
AND THERE IS A FINAL DECISION.

02:26:44.562 --> 02:26:45.630
OCCASIONALLY THERE ARE

02:26:45.696 --> 02:26:48.032
SETTLEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES,

02:26:48.099 --> 02:26:50.801
BUT THAT IS IN GENERAL THE RATE

02:26:50.868 --> 02:26:54.272
MAKING PROCESS. OKAY. SO JUST

02:26:54.338 --> 02:26:57.041
LIKE WITH ALL THE GRCS, THE

02:26:57.108 --> 02:26:58.910
UTILITIES SUBMITS THEIR THEIR

02:26:58.976 --> 02:27:01.512
PROPOSED GENERAL RATE CASE, THEN

02:27:01.579 --> 02:27:03.147
THE ALL THE VARIOUS STATE

02:27:03.214 --> 02:27:04.682
INTERVENORS LABOR, THE

02:27:04.749 --> 02:27:06.250
ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY,

02:27:06.317 --> 02:27:07.885
CONSUMERS, PUBLIC ADVOCATES, ALL

02:27:07.952 --> 02:27:09.487
THEN MAKE COMMENT. YOU GO

02:27:09.554 --> 02:27:12.023
THROUGH A VERY LENGTHY PROCESS

02:27:12.089 --> 02:27:13.291
BEFORE AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW

02:27:13.357 --> 02:27:14.859
JUDGE WHERE A RECORD IS CREATED,

02:27:14.926 --> 02:27:18.029
AND THEN ULTIMATELY IT LEADS TO

02:27:18.095 --> 02:27:19.730
A PROPOSED DECISION BY THAT

02:27:19.797 --> 02:27:20.965
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE THAT

02:27:21.032 --> 02:27:22.200
THE FULL COMMISSION VOTES ON.

02:27:22.266 --> 02:27:23.935
MOST RECENTLY, THE VERY MOST

02:27:24.001 --> 02:27:25.503
RECENT DECISION IS THE

02:27:25.570 --> 02:27:26.637
AFOREMENTIONED SAINT HELENA GAS

02:27:26.704 --> 02:27:29.040
CASE, WHERE THE SETTLEMENT THAT

02:27:29.106 --> 02:27:30.274
WAS SIGNED ON BY PUBLIC

02:27:30.341 --> 02:27:31.742
ADVOCATE'S OFFICE, WHICH HAD

02:27:31.809 --> 02:27:34.212
DECOUPLING IN IT AND PRAISED

02:27:34.278 --> 02:27:36.447
DECOUPLING, WENT THROUGH THAT

02:27:36.514 --> 02:27:37.481
PROCESS AND THEN WAS FINALLY

02:27:37.548 --> 02:27:39.917
ADOPTED. SO THE UTILITY DOES NOT

02:27:39.984 --> 02:27:41.485
CONTROL WHAT THEIR REVENUE LIMIT

02:27:41.552 --> 02:27:44.655
IS. IN FACT, OFTENTIMES WE GO IN

02:27:44.722 --> 02:27:46.657
LABOR, GOES IN AND ARGUES FOR A

02:27:46.724 --> 02:27:48.459
MUCH MORE ROBUST INVESTMENT INTO

02:27:48.526 --> 02:27:50.728
CAPITAL INVESTMENTS ON THE

02:27:50.795 --> 02:27:52.396
OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE UTILITY.

02:27:52.463 --> 02:27:54.031
AND, YOU KNOW, IT GETS HAGGLED

02:27:54.098 --> 02:27:56.334
OUT. YOU KNOW, THAT'S THAT'S HOW

02:27:56.400 --> 02:27:59.837
IT WORKS. THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

02:27:59.904 --> 02:28:00.638
THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR. LET ME

02:28:00.705 --> 02:28:02.607
JUST FIRST ECHO WHAT

02:28:02.673 --> 02:28:04.909
ASSEMBLYMEMBER SAID BY REALLY

02:28:04.976 --> 02:28:06.611
GIVING KUDOS TO THE AUTHOR FOR

02:28:06.677 --> 02:28:07.445
BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT

02:28:07.511 --> 02:28:09.347
DISCUSSION FORWARD. THIS IS

02:28:09.413 --> 02:28:10.147
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. I THINK

02:28:10.214 --> 02:28:11.716
THERE ARE EQUITIES ON BOTH

02:28:11.782 --> 02:28:13.317
SIDES. AND I THINK IT'S A GOOD

02:28:13.384 --> 02:28:15.386
DISCUSSION TO HAVE. AND I DO

02:28:15.453 --> 02:28:16.821
THINK THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO

02:28:16.887 --> 02:28:17.855
HEAR THE EXCELLENT ADVOCACY ON

02:28:17.922 --> 02:28:19.557
BOTH SIDES. SO LET ME JUST SAY

02:28:19.624 --> 02:28:20.791
THAT I WASN'T PLANNING TO ASK A

02:28:20.858 --> 02:28:22.526
QUESTION, BUT ONE THING THAT I

02:28:22.593 --> 02:28:23.628
THOUGHT WAS GOING TO BE

02:28:23.694 --> 02:28:25.496
ADDRESSED THAT WASN'T DOVETAILS

02:28:25.563 --> 02:28:27.798
ON MR. WHICH MR. WEDGE'S LAST

02:28:27.865 --> 02:28:29.267
POINT, WHICH IS CAPITAL

02:28:29.333 --> 02:28:30.201
INVESTMENTS, ANYONE WHO SERVED

02:28:30.268 --> 02:28:31.836
ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHO'S BEEN

02:28:31.902 --> 02:28:33.537
THROUGH A 218 WATER RATE

02:28:33.604 --> 02:28:36.107
PROCESS, OUR OUR WATER

02:28:36.173 --> 02:28:38.309
INFRASTRUCTURE IS AGING AND HAS

02:28:38.376 --> 02:28:42.580
AGED WELL PAST, YOU KNOW, USE

02:28:42.647 --> 02:28:46.550
LIFE. AND MANY OF US AS LOCAL

02:28:46.617 --> 02:28:47.652
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS STRUGGLE

02:28:47.718 --> 02:28:49.587
WITH THAT, TRYING TO GET 218

02:28:49.654 --> 02:28:52.390
WATER RATE INCREASES THROUGH

02:28:52.456 --> 02:28:53.658
THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO UPGRADE

02:28:53.724 --> 02:28:56.327
OUR PIPES AND OUR SEWERS THAT

02:28:56.394 --> 02:28:59.730
ARE SO BADLY NEEDED TO BE

02:28:59.797 --> 02:29:00.898
UPGRADED. AND WHAT I'M MISSING

02:29:00.965 --> 02:29:03.834
HERE IS WHAT WHICH OF THESE

02:29:03.901 --> 02:29:07.838
MECHANISMS ACTUALLY, SORRY,

02:29:07.905 --> 02:29:11.809
ACTUALLY INCENTIVIZES UPGRADES

02:29:11.876 --> 02:29:15.079
TO CAPITAL AND WHICH ONE

02:29:15.146 --> 02:29:17.615
DOESN'T, BECAUSE I WAS EXPECTING

02:29:17.682 --> 02:29:18.716
BOTH SIDES TO ACTUALLY GET TO

02:29:18.783 --> 02:29:20.584
THIS, I THINK. CONSERVATION NOT

02:29:20.651 --> 02:29:22.520
TO BELABOR THE POINT, I THINK

02:29:22.586 --> 02:29:24.055
IT'S VERY SECONDARY IN THIS

02:29:24.121 --> 02:29:25.122
CONVERSATION. CONSERVATION IS

02:29:25.189 --> 02:29:26.490
HAPPENING FOR A NUMBER OF

02:29:26.557 --> 02:29:28.626
REASONS OUTSIDE OF WATER RATES.

02:29:28.693 --> 02:29:30.795
OKAY. WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING

02:29:30.861 --> 02:29:32.330
WITH THESE DIFFERENT RATE

02:29:32.396 --> 02:29:33.331
STRUCTURES THAT IS ACTUALLY

02:29:33.397 --> 02:29:34.498
ALLOWING THE INFRASTRUCTURE

02:29:34.565 --> 02:29:36.233
UPGRADES THAT WE ALL NEED. WE

02:29:36.300 --> 02:29:38.169
JUST WENT THROUGH FIRES. WE JUST

02:29:38.235 --> 02:29:40.638
WENT THROUGH A LOT OF SOUL

02:29:40.705 --> 02:29:43.474
SEARCHING ABOUT WHERE WE ARE

02:29:43.541 --> 02:29:44.909
WITHIN OUR WATER, OUR WATER

02:29:44.975 --> 02:29:45.943
SYSTEMS AND HOW RESILIENT WE

02:29:46.010 --> 02:29:48.546
ARE. SO I WANT TO HEAR ABOUT

02:29:48.612 --> 02:29:49.847
THAT AND HOW THIS IS AFFECTING

02:29:49.914 --> 02:29:53.584
YOU. THANK YOU. SO, SO THANK YOU.

02:29:53.651 --> 02:29:57.088
SO ON AVERAGE, THE FIXED COSTS

02:29:57.154 --> 02:29:59.490
OF A UTILITY IS BETWEEN 50 AND

02:29:59.557 --> 02:30:01.058
80%. THE INDUSTRY AVERAGE IS

02:30:01.125 --> 02:30:04.328
ABOUT 70. THAT'S THE COST OF

02:30:04.395 --> 02:30:06.597
WATER. THEIR CONTRACTS YOU KNOW,

02:30:06.664 --> 02:30:07.765
AND IF THEY'RE DOING TREATMENT

02:30:07.832 --> 02:30:10.434
THEIR TREATMENT AND THEN CAPITAL

02:30:10.501 --> 02:30:12.703
INVESTMENT IF YOU HAVE

02:30:12.770 --> 02:30:13.804
DECOUPLING YOU HAVE A LOWER

02:30:13.871 --> 02:30:16.574
FIXED CHARGE. IF YOU DON'T HAVE

02:30:16.640 --> 02:30:18.008
DECOUPLING, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A

02:30:18.075 --> 02:30:19.877
LARGER FIXED CHARGE. WHO WHO

02:30:19.944 --> 02:30:22.012
DOES THAT? WHO DOES THAT HURT

02:30:22.079 --> 02:30:24.415
THE FIXED CHARGE? A LARGER FIXED

02:30:24.482 --> 02:30:26.717
CHARGE IS BECOMES A

02:30:26.784 --> 02:30:27.852
PROPORTIONATELY MUCH LARGER

02:30:27.918 --> 02:30:30.354
PIECE OF THE LOWER INCOME, LOWER

02:30:30.421 --> 02:30:32.590
WATER USER RATEPAYER. SO THEY

02:30:32.656 --> 02:30:34.225
END UP DISPROPORTIONATELY

02:30:34.291 --> 02:30:35.593
BEARING THE COST OF ALL THAT

02:30:35.659 --> 02:30:37.061
CAPITAL INVESTMENT. WHEN YOU

02:30:37.128 --> 02:30:40.030
HAVE DECOUPLING AND YOU HAVE THE

02:30:40.097 --> 02:30:41.332
UTILITY HAVING THE ASSURANCES

02:30:41.399 --> 02:30:42.099
THAT THEY WILL MEET THEIR

02:30:42.166 --> 02:30:43.901
REVENUE MARK SO THEY CAN

02:30:43.968 --> 02:30:45.703
COMPLETE THEIR CAPITAL

02:30:45.770 --> 02:30:48.005
IMPROVEMENTS, THEN THEY CAN GO

02:30:48.072 --> 02:30:51.442
IN AND IMPLEMENT A CAPITAL

02:30:51.509 --> 02:30:53.277
IMPROVEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE

02:30:53.344 --> 02:30:54.178
PROGRAM THAT THEY CAN FOLLOW

02:30:54.245 --> 02:30:55.679
THROUGH WHICH WHICH IS PRECISELY

02:30:55.746 --> 02:30:57.581
WHY THE UTILITY WORKERS IN THE

02:30:57.648 --> 02:30:59.617
PIPE TRADES ARE SO SUPPORTIVE OF

02:30:59.683 --> 02:31:01.385
THIS BILL. I'LL JUST QUICKLY ADD

02:31:01.452 --> 02:31:03.788
THAT WHEN THE CPUC DOES

02:31:03.854 --> 02:31:05.122
RATEMAKING, THEY DETERMINE A

02:31:05.189 --> 02:31:06.524
REVENUE REQUIREMENT, AND THAT

02:31:06.590 --> 02:31:08.492
REVENUE REQUIREMENT IS BASED ON

02:31:08.559 --> 02:31:10.628
HOW MANY CAPITAL PROJECTS THE

02:31:10.694 --> 02:31:12.763
CPUC BELIEVES ARE NEEDED AND

02:31:12.830 --> 02:31:13.998
NECESSARY TO KEEP YOUR WATER

02:31:14.064 --> 02:31:16.033
SYSTEM IN GOOD OPERATION

02:31:16.100 --> 02:31:17.802
OPERATIONAL CONDITION. NOW, IF

02:31:17.868 --> 02:31:19.804
WE DON'T HIT THAT REVENUE

02:31:19.870 --> 02:31:20.971
REQUIREMENT, THAT MEANS WE HAVE

02:31:21.038 --> 02:31:22.807
LESS MONEY TO COMPLETE THOSE

02:31:22.873 --> 02:31:24.575
CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT THE CPUC

02:31:24.642 --> 02:31:26.777
HAS DEEMED TO BE NECESSARY. SO

02:31:26.844 --> 02:31:29.880
WHAT DOES DECOUPLING IS? IT

02:31:29.947 --> 02:31:31.449
ALLOWS US TO REALIZE THAT

02:31:31.515 --> 02:31:34.084
REVENUE REQUIREMENT WHEN SALES

02:31:34.151 --> 02:31:35.886
FALL SHORT. AND WE CAN'T COLLECT

02:31:35.953 --> 02:31:37.321
MORE THAN THAT, BECAUSE IF WE

02:31:37.388 --> 02:31:39.190
DID, WE GAVE THAT BACK TO THE

02:31:39.256 --> 02:31:41.859
CUSTOMERS. THE OTHER DECOUPLING

02:31:41.926 --> 02:31:43.127
MECHANISM, WHATEVER YOU REFER TO

02:31:43.194 --> 02:31:45.830
IT AS, DOES NOT GIVE THAT

02:31:45.896 --> 02:31:49.133
REVENUE ASSURANCE. IF THROUGH

02:31:49.200 --> 02:31:50.734
THE CHAIR, IF I MAY RESPOND,

02:31:50.801 --> 02:31:52.436
YES, THANK YOU. FIRST, I JUST

02:31:52.503 --> 02:31:53.671
WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE

02:31:53.737 --> 02:31:56.140
PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE

02:31:56.207 --> 02:31:57.641
ADVOCATES FOR AFFORDABLE, SAFE

02:31:57.708 --> 02:31:59.243
AND RELIABLE SERVICE. SO OF

02:31:59.310 --> 02:32:00.611
COURSE, PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE IS

02:32:00.678 --> 02:32:03.581
TOP OF MIND FOR US AS WELL. THE

02:32:03.647 --> 02:32:05.382
QUESTION IS WHO WHO PAYS FOR

02:32:05.449 --> 02:32:07.685
PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE? IT'S THE

02:32:07.751 --> 02:32:09.286
RATEPAYERS OF COURSE. AND SO THE

02:32:09.353 --> 02:32:10.187
I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION

02:32:10.254 --> 02:32:11.789
EARLIER ABOUT GENERAL RATE CASE

02:32:11.856 --> 02:32:14.425
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE CLOSELY

02:32:14.492 --> 02:32:16.260
LITIGATE THESE LINE ITEMS ITEM

02:32:16.327 --> 02:32:17.895
BY ITEM. AND WE ARE A PARTY TO

02:32:17.962 --> 02:32:20.364
THAT. THE WATER UTILITIES,

02:32:20.431 --> 02:32:21.432
ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS, LABOR

02:32:21.499 --> 02:32:22.867
GROUPS, A NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDERS

02:32:22.933 --> 02:32:24.702
HAVE A CLOSELY VESTED INTEREST

02:32:24.768 --> 02:32:26.537
IN SEEING THESE CONVERSATIONS

02:32:26.604 --> 02:32:28.405
PAN OUT. HOW WE PLAN FOR THE

02:32:28.472 --> 02:32:30.107
FUTURE THREE YEARS IN ADVANCE.

02:32:30.174 --> 02:32:32.376
TYPICALLY, THE CHALLENGE IS

02:32:32.443 --> 02:32:34.478
STRIKING A FINE BALANCE BETWEEN

02:32:34.545 --> 02:32:35.880
ENSURING WE HAVE SUFFICIENT

02:32:35.946 --> 02:32:37.982
FUNDS FOR CRITICAL PUBLIC

02:32:38.048 --> 02:32:39.116
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS, WHILE

02:32:39.183 --> 02:32:41.652
ALSO MAKING SURE WE'RE NOT

02:32:41.719 --> 02:32:43.420
BURDENING RATEPAYERS WITH

02:32:43.487 --> 02:32:45.022
MONTHLY BILLS THAT THEY CAN'T

02:32:45.089 --> 02:32:47.791
KEEP UP WITH. AND SO I ALSO JUST

02:32:47.858 --> 02:32:48.926
WANT TO POINT OUT THAT IN THE

02:32:48.993 --> 02:32:50.928
LAST FEW INSTANCES WHERE WATER

02:32:50.995 --> 02:32:53.597
UTILITIES HAVE COME TO THE CPUC

02:32:53.664 --> 02:32:58.802
TO ASK FOR FULL RAM, JOBS HAVE

02:32:58.869 --> 02:32:59.770
NOT BEEN A PART OF THAT

02:32:59.837 --> 02:33:01.438
DISCUSSION. AND WHEN WE'VE

02:33:01.505 --> 02:33:02.840
LOOKED AT THE TEN YEAR PILOT

02:33:02.907 --> 02:33:04.842
PROGRAM THAT WAS DONE FROM 2008

02:33:04.909 --> 02:33:06.544
TO 2019 AT THE CPUC, WE HAVE NO

02:33:06.610 --> 02:33:08.646
EVIDENCE. I'M HAPPY TO READ IF

02:33:08.712 --> 02:33:12.550
THERE IS SOME THAT HAS NOT BEEN

02:33:12.616 --> 02:33:13.317
SUBMITTED, BUT THERE'S NO

02:33:13.384 --> 02:33:14.752
EVIDENCE TO OUR KNOWLEDGE AT THE

02:33:14.818 --> 02:33:17.354
PUC THAT RAM CREATED MORE JOBS.

02:33:17.421 --> 02:33:19.223
AND ADDITIONALLY, THERE'S NO

02:33:19.290 --> 02:33:20.891
EVIDENCE THAT A LACK OF RAM HAS

02:33:20.958 --> 02:33:23.227
LED TO A LOSS OF JOBS. AND THAT

02:33:23.294 --> 02:33:25.162
IS JUST WHAT THE DATA AT THE PUC

02:33:25.229 --> 02:33:26.664
HAS SHOWN. AND THAT'S DATA

02:33:26.730 --> 02:33:28.432
SUBMITTED BY THE UTILITIES

02:33:28.499 --> 02:33:29.567
THEMSELVES. AND I DON'T HAVE MY

02:33:29.633 --> 02:33:30.134
COLLEAGUE WOULD LIKE TO ADD

02:33:30.200 --> 02:33:32.636
ANYTHING TO THAT DO. ANYTHING I

02:33:32.703 --> 02:33:34.605
WOULD ADD IS I THINK EVERYONE

02:33:34.672 --> 02:33:36.807
HAS HEARD A LOT OF SPECULATION

02:33:36.874 --> 02:33:38.242
ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN, WHAT

02:33:38.309 --> 02:33:41.045
COULD HAPPEN IF RAM ISN'T BEEN,

02:33:41.111 --> 02:33:44.048
IF RAM ISN'T GRANTED, I WOULD

02:33:44.114 --> 02:33:46.350
JUST POINT OUT FOR THE LAST 15

02:33:46.417 --> 02:33:48.319
YEARS, HALF OF OUR LARGEST WATER

02:33:48.385 --> 02:33:50.187
UTILITIES IN THE STATE HAVE

02:33:50.254 --> 02:33:51.422
OPERATED VERY SUCCESSFULLY

02:33:51.488 --> 02:33:53.290
WITHOUT THE FULL RAM, AND NONE

02:33:53.357 --> 02:33:57.027
OF THESE ISSUES THAT ARE ASSUMED

02:33:57.094 --> 02:33:59.496
TO BE FALSE IF RAM IS NOT

02:33:59.563 --> 02:34:01.332
REINSTATED HAVE OCCURRED FOR ANY

02:34:01.398 --> 02:34:02.366
OF THOSE FOUR LARGE WATER

02:34:02.433 --> 02:34:05.235
UTILITIES ON THE JOBS ISSUE.

02:34:05.302 --> 02:34:07.738
MADAM CHAIR, WHAT THE PUBLIC

02:34:07.805 --> 02:34:09.139
ADVOCATE OFFICE IS REFERRING TO

02:34:09.206 --> 02:34:12.009
IS THERE'S NO LOSS OF JOBS

02:34:12.076 --> 02:34:14.211
WITHIN THE WATER UTILITIES. THE

02:34:14.278 --> 02:34:16.013
MAJORITY OF CAPITAL OUTLAY WORK

02:34:16.080 --> 02:34:17.748
IS DONE IN CONTRACTED OUT WORK.

02:34:17.815 --> 02:34:19.617
SO OBVIOUSLY THE PUC WOULDN'T

02:34:19.683 --> 02:34:21.218
TRACK THE NUMBER OF JOBS THAT MY

02:34:21.285 --> 02:34:23.120
MEMBERS LOST BECAUSE CONTRACTS

02:34:23.187 --> 02:34:24.922
WERE NOT PROCURED FOR DOING THE

02:34:24.989 --> 02:34:25.956
MAINTENANCE AND THE UPGRADES TO

02:34:26.023 --> 02:34:28.325
THE SYSTEM. THANK YOU. ALL

02:34:28.392 --> 02:34:29.660
RIGHT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:34:29.727 --> 02:34:33.764
PATTERSON. GREAT. THANK YOU.

02:34:33.831 --> 02:34:36.400
QUESTION FOR THE PUBLIC

02:34:36.467 --> 02:34:39.703
ADVOCATE'S OFFICE, PRESUMABLY,

02:34:39.770 --> 02:34:42.306
SHOULD THIS MEASURE PASS THE

02:34:42.373 --> 02:34:46.276
PUC, I ASSUME, WOULD STILL BE

02:34:46.343 --> 02:34:47.444
INTERESTED, AND YOU YOUR OFFICE

02:34:47.511 --> 02:34:51.548
WOULD STILL BE INTERESTED IN THE

02:34:51.615 --> 02:34:52.549
RELIABILITY, THE SAME GOALS.

02:34:52.616 --> 02:34:58.088
RIGHT? SO I GUESS I'M CONFUSED

02:34:58.155 --> 02:35:00.190
ON, YOU KNOW, WHEN THE RATE

02:35:00.257 --> 02:35:02.760
SETTING MOVES FORWARD, IF THOSE

02:35:02.826 --> 02:35:05.763
GOALS ARE STILL THERE, THEN

02:35:05.829 --> 02:35:07.498
YOU'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE THE

02:35:07.564 --> 02:35:09.366
SAME OR THE PUC WILL STILL HAVE

02:35:09.433 --> 02:35:12.202
THE SAME VIEW OF WHAT'S GOING

02:35:12.269 --> 02:35:14.238
ON. HEY, LET'S NOT DO TOO MUCH

02:35:14.304 --> 02:35:15.072
INFRASTRUCTURE RIGHT NOW, OR

02:35:15.139 --> 02:35:19.009
LET'S NOT OVERSPEND OR, YOU

02:35:19.076 --> 02:35:21.111
KNOW, WHATEVER THE COSTS ARE

02:35:21.178 --> 02:35:22.913
INEFFICIENT LIKE THEY DO NOW. I

02:35:22.980 --> 02:35:24.148
ASSUME THAT WOULD STILL BE THE

02:35:24.214 --> 02:35:27.284
CASE, RIGHT? I, I WILL TRY TO

02:35:27.351 --> 02:35:28.952
ANSWER AND I HOPE THAT I ANSWER,

02:35:29.019 --> 02:35:31.021
BUT IF I DON'T, PLEASE LET ME

02:35:31.088 --> 02:35:32.289
KNOW. ABSOLUTELY. ALL OF THOSE

02:35:32.356 --> 02:35:33.791
ARE QUESTIONS THAT OUR OFFICE,

02:35:33.857 --> 02:35:35.559
AS WELL AS OTHER RATEPAYER

02:35:35.626 --> 02:35:37.294
ADVOCATES IN THIS SPACE, WILL

02:35:37.361 --> 02:35:39.930
CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR. WHAT

02:35:39.997 --> 02:35:41.865
WE ALSO, AND I GUESS IT HASN'T

02:35:41.932 --> 02:35:43.701
BEEN SAID EXPLICITLY THUS FAR,

02:35:43.767 --> 02:35:46.003
IS WHILE WATER UTILITIES

02:35:46.070 --> 02:35:47.604
CURRENTLY HAVE FULL AUTHORITY TO

02:35:47.671 --> 02:35:49.073
APPLY FOR RAM, IT IS INCUMBENT

02:35:49.139 --> 02:35:50.641
UPON THEM TO MAKE THE CASE FOR

02:35:50.708 --> 02:35:52.776
WHY IT IS BEST FOR RATEPAYERS.

02:35:52.843 --> 02:35:53.544
AND THAT QUESTION INCLUDES ALL

02:35:53.610 --> 02:35:55.612
OF THOSE THINGS THAT YOU JUST

02:35:55.679 --> 02:35:57.114
INCLUDED. IS IT SAFE? IS IT

02:35:57.181 --> 02:35:58.782
RELIABLE? IS IT AFFORDABLE? IT

02:35:58.849 --> 02:36:00.951
IS INCUMBENT UPON THE CPUC TO

02:36:01.018 --> 02:36:02.586
LOOK AT THE INPUT FROM ALL

02:36:02.653 --> 02:36:03.787
STAKEHOLDERS, NOT JUST US, NOT

02:36:03.854 --> 02:36:05.522
JUST THE WATER UTILITIES. ALL OF

02:36:05.589 --> 02:36:07.057
THE DATA THAT'S BEEN COLLECTED

02:36:07.124 --> 02:36:08.692
OVER THESE LAST MANY YEARS. TO

02:36:08.759 --> 02:36:10.160
ANSWER THAT QUESTION, WHAT IS

02:36:10.227 --> 02:36:12.162
THE BEST PATH FORWARD? AND SO

02:36:12.229 --> 02:36:14.031
WHETHER THIS BILL IS PASSED OR

02:36:14.098 --> 02:36:15.132
NOT, WE WILL CONTINUE TO

02:36:15.199 --> 02:36:18.102
ADVOCATE FOR THAT. YEAH. THANK

02:36:18.168 --> 02:36:23.107
YOU. QUESTION FOR MR. WELCH ON

02:36:23.173 --> 02:36:27.711
THE FIXED CHARGES. YOU YOU

02:36:27.778 --> 02:36:29.680
MENTIONED IT'S 50 TO 80 IS KIND

02:36:29.747 --> 02:36:31.482
OF THE AVERAGE FIXED COST ON

02:36:31.548 --> 02:36:35.285
FIXED COSTS. AND THIS BILL, AT

02:36:35.352 --> 02:36:37.855
LEAST FROM MY READING OF IT, AND

02:36:37.921 --> 02:36:39.056
I THINK YOU MENTIONED THIS

02:36:39.123 --> 02:36:41.592
PROHIBITS ESSENTIALLY IF THERE'S

02:36:41.658 --> 02:36:43.360
AN OVER COLLECTION THERE'S GOING

02:36:43.427 --> 02:36:45.863
TO BE A REFUND. IS THAT A CREDIT

02:36:45.929 --> 02:36:47.865
BACK IN CREDITS. IT'S STATED

02:36:47.931 --> 02:36:49.867
THREE TIMES IN IN THREE

02:36:49.933 --> 02:36:51.101
DIFFERENT PLACES IN THE BILL.

02:36:51.168 --> 02:36:55.038
YEAH. SO IF CUSTOMERS ARE PAYING

02:36:55.105 --> 02:36:57.574
MORE THAN THEY SHOULD AFTER. AND

02:36:57.641 --> 02:36:59.443
HOW DOES THAT PROCESS WORK? HOW

02:36:59.510 --> 02:37:01.311
WILL THAT PROCESS WORK EXACTLY.

02:37:01.378 --> 02:37:03.714
THIS IS SIMILAR TO HOW IT WORKS

02:37:03.781 --> 02:37:05.015
IN ELECTRICAL AND THE GAS SIDE.

02:37:05.082 --> 02:37:06.650
AND THAT IS AT THE END OF THE

02:37:06.717 --> 02:37:08.652
YEAR THERE THERE'S A TRUE UP.

02:37:08.719 --> 02:37:12.723
AND IF, IF, IF COSTS IF COST

02:37:12.790 --> 02:37:13.590
CALCULATIONS WERE WRONG FOR

02:37:13.657 --> 02:37:16.026
INSTANCE MAYBE THE THERE'S AN

02:37:16.093 --> 02:37:17.227
EXTREMELY WET YEAR. AND SO YOU

02:37:17.294 --> 02:37:19.463
KNOW WATER IS CHEAPER AND SO OR

02:37:19.530 --> 02:37:22.733
YOU KNOW THE WHATEVER THE

02:37:22.800 --> 02:37:24.902
REASONS VARIOUS REASONS ARE THEN

02:37:24.968 --> 02:37:26.970
THE THEN THERE'S A CREDIT AT THE

02:37:27.037 --> 02:37:29.006
END OF THE YEAR THAT GOES BACK

02:37:29.072 --> 02:37:31.508
AND YOU KNOW, IT. JUST LAST

02:37:31.575 --> 02:37:34.645
YEAR, CAL AM WATER OR THE LAST

02:37:34.711 --> 02:37:38.982
YEAR CAL AM WATER CREDITED BACK

02:37:39.049 --> 02:37:40.284
$15.4 MILLION TO THEIR

02:37:40.350 --> 02:37:43.787
RATEPAYERS OR OR I SHOULD SAY,

02:37:43.854 --> 02:37:47.724
DIDN'T OVER COLLECTED BY $15.4

02:37:47.791 --> 02:37:49.693
MILLION. BUT BUT BECAUSE

02:37:49.760 --> 02:37:51.461
DECOUPLING WASN'T IN PLACE DID

02:37:51.528 --> 02:37:53.197
NOT CREDIT IT BACK BUT UNDER

02:37:53.263 --> 02:37:54.531
DECOUPLING, IF THAT HAD HAD BEEN

02:37:54.598 --> 02:37:55.899
IN PLACE, THEY WOULD HAVE

02:37:55.966 --> 02:37:57.901
CREDITED IT BACK, OR AT LEAST

02:37:57.968 --> 02:37:58.502
ACCORDING TO THIS BILL WHICH

02:37:58.569 --> 02:37:59.570
WOULD PROHIBIT WHICH WOULD

02:37:59.636 --> 02:38:03.073
REQUIRE THAT. YES. DID YOU?

02:38:03.140 --> 02:38:03.674
ABSOLUTELY. WOULD YOU LIKE TO

02:38:03.740 --> 02:38:06.910
RESPOND? AS MEMBER PATTERSON, IF

02:38:06.977 --> 02:38:08.679
I COULD, JUST FOR A SECOND,

02:38:08.745 --> 02:38:09.680
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT THAT

02:38:09.746 --> 02:38:11.515
THE BILL AS WRITTEN PREVENTS

02:38:11.582 --> 02:38:13.150
OVER COLLECTION UNDER COLLECTION

02:38:13.217 --> 02:38:15.485
OF REVENUES. REVENUES IS ONE

02:38:15.552 --> 02:38:19.056
HALF THE PICTURE. $1 MILLION IN

02:38:19.122 --> 02:38:20.424
REVENUE IS VERY DIFFERENT. IF

02:38:20.490 --> 02:38:22.426
YOU HAVE $1 MILLION IN COST

02:38:22.492 --> 02:38:24.161
VERSUS $1 MILLION IN REVENUE, IF

02:38:24.228 --> 02:38:26.597
YOU HAVE A HALF A MILLION, THE

02:38:26.663 --> 02:38:30.500
PUC IS ESTABLISHED TO PREVENT

02:38:30.567 --> 02:38:33.036
UNREASONABLE MONOPOLY PROFITS.

02:38:33.103 --> 02:38:34.905
THAT IS WHERE THE RUBBER MEETS

02:38:34.972 --> 02:38:38.108
THE ROAD. AND IF YOU'RE LOOKING

02:38:38.175 --> 02:38:40.510
AT REVENUES ONLY EXCLUSIVELY, AS

02:38:40.577 --> 02:38:42.479
THIS BILL DOES, YOU'RE MISSING

02:38:42.546 --> 02:38:44.147
THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.

02:38:44.214 --> 02:38:47.417
IT'S PROFITS. AND THIS BILL AND

02:38:47.484 --> 02:38:49.887
THE FULL RAM MECHANISM AS IT'S

02:38:49.953 --> 02:38:52.656
AS IT EXISTS, FAILS TO TAKE THAT

02:38:52.723 --> 02:38:53.891
INTO ACCOUNT. IT LOOKS AT SOME

02:38:53.957 --> 02:38:55.659
VARIABLE COSTS, BUT AS WE'VE

02:38:55.726 --> 02:38:58.395
HEARD, 6,070% ARE FIXED COSTS.

02:38:58.462 --> 02:39:01.365
AND WHEN THOSE FIXED COSTS ARE

02:39:01.431 --> 02:39:04.034
CONSIDERED, THE FULL RAM CAN

02:39:04.101 --> 02:39:05.769
ALLOW UTILITY THAT'S ALREADY

02:39:05.836 --> 02:39:07.104
EXCEEDING ITS COMMISSION

02:39:07.170 --> 02:39:09.740
AUTHORIZED REASONABLE PROFIT TO

02:39:09.806 --> 02:39:11.975
FURTHER EXCEED ITS REASONABLE

02:39:12.042 --> 02:39:13.310
PROFIT. THIS HAS BEEN

02:39:13.377 --> 02:39:14.678
MISCHARACTERIZED AS SOMEHOW

02:39:14.745 --> 02:39:17.180
CAPPING THE PROFITS OF UTILITY.

02:39:17.247 --> 02:39:19.016
UTILITY PROFITS ARE NOT CAPPED.

02:39:19.082 --> 02:39:20.918
THEY WOULDN'T BE UNDER AN

02:39:20.984 --> 02:39:23.687
AMENDMENT TO CONSIDER PROFITS

02:39:23.754 --> 02:39:25.389
THE WHOLE PICTURE AS OPPOSED TO

02:39:25.455 --> 02:39:26.590
JUST THE REVENUES. SO I'M GLAD

02:39:26.657 --> 02:39:29.059
YOU ASKED THAT. THANK YOU. YEAH,

02:39:29.126 --> 02:39:29.993
BECAUSE I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT

02:39:30.060 --> 02:39:32.963
THAT TOO. THE GENERAL RATE CASE

02:39:33.030 --> 02:39:35.499
HAS TO DO WITH REVENUES. THE

02:39:35.565 --> 02:39:38.468
ISSUE OF A RATE OF RETURN IS

02:39:38.535 --> 02:39:40.671
HANDLED DURING THE COST OF

02:39:40.737 --> 02:39:41.738
CAPITAL PROCEEDING, WHICH IS A

02:39:41.805 --> 02:39:43.573
DIFFERENT PROCEEDING. THIS BILL

02:39:43.640 --> 02:39:45.042
DOESN'T DEAL WITH THE COST OF

02:39:45.108 --> 02:39:46.176
CAPITAL PROCEEDING. IT'S JUST

02:39:46.243 --> 02:39:47.244
DEALING WITH THE GENERAL RATE

02:39:47.311 --> 02:39:48.845
CASE AND THE REVENUES APPROVED

02:39:48.912 --> 02:39:54.751
PURSUANT TO THE GRC. OKAY. I

02:39:54.818 --> 02:39:57.254
DON'T I DON'T LIVE IN ONE OF THE

02:39:57.321 --> 02:39:58.155
TERRITORIES OF ONE OF THESE

02:39:58.221 --> 02:39:59.823
COMPANIES, BUT I WAS JUST GOING

02:39:59.890 --> 02:40:02.292
THROUGH MY BILLS WHERE WE HAVE

02:40:02.359 --> 02:40:05.629
SOME GREAT UTILITIES THAT SERVE

02:40:05.696 --> 02:40:07.631
OUR WATER NEEDS, BUT THE FIXED

02:40:07.698 --> 02:40:11.335
COSTS ARE VERY, VERY HIGH. AND I

02:40:11.401 --> 02:40:13.036
WAS LOOKING AT ONE OF THE BILLS

02:40:13.103 --> 02:40:18.041
AND OUT OF THE $62, $9 OF IT WAS

02:40:18.108 --> 02:40:22.713
FOR USE. AND I THINK, YOU KNOW,

02:40:22.779 --> 02:40:25.248
I JUST SEE WHERE THAT

02:40:25.315 --> 02:40:26.783
DISINCENTIVIZES ANY CONSERVATION

02:40:26.850 --> 02:40:28.852
AT ALL. BECAUSE IF I WATER MY

02:40:28.919 --> 02:40:30.887
LAWN EVERY DAY, THE WATER IS

02:40:30.954 --> 02:40:34.491
ACTUALLY QUITE CHEAP. AND SO I

02:40:34.558 --> 02:40:36.994
AM INTERESTED AND IT'S ALWAYS

02:40:37.060 --> 02:40:38.562
IT'S I'VE ALWAYS HAD AN ISSUE

02:40:38.628 --> 02:40:40.931
EVER SINCE I WAS ON THE CITY

02:40:40.998 --> 02:40:42.099
COUNCIL WITH, WITH SOME OF THE

02:40:42.165 --> 02:40:43.467
UTILITIES, BECAUSE WE'RE SERVED

02:40:43.533 --> 02:40:45.769
BY A LOT OF SPECIAL DISTRICTS

02:40:45.836 --> 02:40:48.271
THAT ARE ALL AMAZING. BUT WE DID

02:40:48.338 --> 02:40:51.008
ALWAYS OPINE ON THE INCREASES IN

02:40:51.074 --> 02:40:54.044
THOSE FIXED CHARGES, BECAUSE I

02:40:54.111 --> 02:40:56.079
FELT LIKE THAT IS WHAT IMPACTED

02:40:56.146 --> 02:40:57.614
THAT CERTAINLY IMPACTS MY

02:40:57.681 --> 02:41:00.784
BEHAVIOR, AND I FELT LIKE IT

02:41:00.851 --> 02:41:03.553
IMPACTED ALSO THEIR DECISION

02:41:03.620 --> 02:41:06.156
MAKING AND, AND REALLY WHAT THE

02:41:06.223 --> 02:41:08.525
FIXED RATES COULD COVER. AND IT

02:41:08.592 --> 02:41:10.727
WAS ALWAYS A IT WAS A BIG THING.

02:41:10.794 --> 02:41:13.363
BUT LIKE I SAID, YOU KNOW, 50 OF

02:41:13.430 --> 02:41:16.066
53 OF THE $62 ON MY BILL WAS FOR

02:41:16.133 --> 02:41:17.934
FIXED COSTS. AND SO I JUST THINK

02:41:18.001 --> 02:41:19.169
IT CREATED SOME PRETTY BIG

02:41:19.236 --> 02:41:20.470
DISINCENTIVES. AND SO THAT'S WHY

02:41:20.537 --> 02:41:22.372
I'M KIND OF INCLINED TO SUPPORT

02:41:22.439 --> 02:41:23.707
THIS BILL TODAY. I MEAN, IF

02:41:23.774 --> 02:41:28.545
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO I LIKE

02:41:28.612 --> 02:41:30.580
THE I UNDERSTAND SORT OF THE

02:41:30.647 --> 02:41:32.883
DISCUSSION ON THE ON THE PROFIT

02:41:32.949 --> 02:41:36.186
AND ALSO THE, THE REVENUE. AND I

02:41:36.253 --> 02:41:37.454
THINK THAT THAT IS AN

02:41:37.521 --> 02:41:38.889
INTERESTING AND VERY IMPORTANT

02:41:38.955 --> 02:41:41.158
DISCUSSION TO HAVE. IT'S NOT

02:41:41.224 --> 02:41:43.360
GOOD NEWS WHEN, YOU KNOW, AT

02:41:43.427 --> 02:41:45.062
LEAST IN THE PUBLIC, WHEN THEY

02:41:45.128 --> 02:41:47.431
HAVE ONE CHOICE AND THE PROFITS

02:41:47.497 --> 02:41:48.698
ARE REALLY HIGH. I MEAN, I

02:41:48.765 --> 02:41:51.234
UNDERSTAND THAT BRINGS A LOT OF

02:41:51.301 --> 02:41:53.303
CONCERNS WITH RESIDENTS. AND SO

02:41:53.370 --> 02:41:54.938
THAT'S ALWAYS AN INTERESTING

02:41:55.005 --> 02:41:56.239
CONVERSATION. AND I THINK

02:41:56.306 --> 02:41:56.973
IMPORTANT ONE, AND FOR THE

02:41:57.040 --> 02:42:00.110
PURPOSES OF THIS CONVERSATION, I

02:42:00.177 --> 02:42:01.278
THINK I'M LEANING TOWARDS

02:42:01.344 --> 02:42:03.814
SUPPORTING THIS BILL BECAUSE

02:42:03.880 --> 02:42:05.215
JUST MAYBE IT'S JUST MY

02:42:05.282 --> 02:42:06.716
EXPERIENCE AND LISTENING TO THE

02:42:06.783 --> 02:42:08.952
DEBATE HERE, AND I APPRECIATE

02:42:09.019 --> 02:42:10.687
EVERYBODY'S INPUT ON IT. BUT I

02:42:10.754 --> 02:42:12.255
MEAN, MY NUMBER ONE PRIORITY,

02:42:12.322 --> 02:42:13.623
AND I'M SURE YOURS AS WELL,

02:42:13.690 --> 02:42:16.059
THOUGH, IS MAKING SURE PEOPLE

02:42:16.126 --> 02:42:18.462
PAY THE LOWEST RATE POSSIBLE. SO

02:42:18.528 --> 02:42:22.766
THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU, VICE

02:42:22.833 --> 02:42:25.435
CHAIR PATTERSON, I DO APPRECIATE

02:42:25.502 --> 02:42:27.037
THE MEMBER ENGAGEMENT QUESTIONS

02:42:27.104 --> 02:42:29.139
AND DEBATE. YOU KNOW, SAY THAT I

02:42:29.206 --> 02:42:31.374
HAVE FOUND THIS TO BE A UNIQUELY

02:42:31.441 --> 02:42:32.008
CONFOUNDING NO. I KNOW THERE'S

02:42:32.075 --> 02:42:33.243
OTHER FOLKS LOOKING TO ASK

02:42:33.310 --> 02:42:34.945
QUESTIONS, AND I WILL BE CALLING

02:42:35.011 --> 02:42:36.813
YOU IN A MINUTE. I HAVE FOUND

02:42:36.880 --> 02:42:38.415
THIS TO BE A UNIQUELY

02:42:38.482 --> 02:42:40.550
CONFOUNDING TOPIC BECAUSE, AS I

02:42:40.617 --> 02:42:42.419
THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA

02:42:42.486 --> 02:42:44.221
SAID, WE OFTEN HAVE DISPUTES

02:42:44.287 --> 02:42:47.357
ABOUT POLICY MATTERS AND

02:42:47.424 --> 02:42:49.192
SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENTS. THIS

02:42:49.259 --> 02:42:52.429
DOES FEEL TO BE A FUNDAMENTAL

02:42:52.496 --> 02:42:55.432
DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THE DATA AND

02:42:55.499 --> 02:42:58.235
THE FACTS. AND THAT IS WHY.

02:42:58.301 --> 02:42:59.703
WELL, I YOU KNOW, YOU PERSUADED

02:42:59.769 --> 02:43:01.838
ME TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. I

02:43:01.905 --> 02:43:03.106
DID PUT IT BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE

02:43:03.173 --> 02:43:06.209
WITHOUT A RECOMMENDATION, AND I

02:43:06.276 --> 02:43:08.345
THINK THAT I WOULD LOVE FOR I

02:43:08.411 --> 02:43:09.646
WOULD LOVE, SENATOR, FOR YOU TO

02:43:09.713 --> 02:43:13.216
HELP US UNDERSTAND. YOU KNOW, I

02:43:13.283 --> 02:43:15.085
THINK THE FUNDAMENTAL PREMISE OF

02:43:15.152 --> 02:43:17.621
THIS BILL SAYS THAT THE PUC HAS

02:43:17.687 --> 02:43:20.891
GOTTEN THIS WRONG FOR THE LAST

02:43:20.957 --> 02:43:22.726
EIGHT YEARS, THAT THEY'VE

02:43:22.792 --> 02:43:24.027
CONSISTENTLY GOT IT WRONG, THAT

02:43:24.094 --> 02:43:26.396
THE POW HAS IT WRONG. NOW, CAN

02:43:26.463 --> 02:43:29.833
YOU JUST HELP US UNDERSTAND

02:43:29.900 --> 02:43:31.401
THAT? AND LIKE, WHY WAS THAT?

02:43:31.468 --> 02:43:33.170
YOU KNOW, WHY DO YOU BELIEVE

02:43:33.236 --> 02:43:34.771
THAT TO BE TRUE? MADAM CHAIR,

02:43:34.838 --> 02:43:37.140
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. WHAT

02:43:37.207 --> 02:43:38.508
A FASCINATING DEBATE TO WITNESS.

02:43:38.575 --> 02:43:40.010
IN PART, AS THE AUTHOR OF THE

02:43:40.076 --> 02:43:41.745
BILL, IT SORT OF BROUGHT BACK

02:43:41.811 --> 02:43:42.879
SOME UNPLEASANT MEMORIES FROM A

02:43:42.946 --> 02:43:44.948
PRIOR LIFE. I THINK THE SHORT,

02:43:45.015 --> 02:43:47.317
THE SHORT ANSWER IS THE BALANCE

02:43:47.384 --> 02:43:49.786
OF DATA. THERE DOES NOT SEEM TO

02:43:49.853 --> 02:43:51.154
BE A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE

02:43:51.221 --> 02:43:52.923
CONSTRUCT OR THE MECHANISM.

02:43:52.989 --> 02:43:54.724
THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A

02:43:54.791 --> 02:43:55.392
MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE

02:43:55.458 --> 02:43:57.327
INTENT OF THE MECHANISM AND

02:43:57.394 --> 02:43:59.029
BRINGING IT BACK TO THE BILL,

02:43:59.095 --> 02:44:01.064
BOTH IN TERMS OF WHAT THE BILL

02:44:01.131 --> 02:44:02.332
LANGUAGE PRESCRIBES AND WHAT IT

02:44:02.399 --> 02:44:03.433
PERMITS WITH RESPECT TO THE

02:44:03.500 --> 02:44:05.535
REGULATORY PROCESS. ONE THAT,

02:44:05.602 --> 02:44:07.370
IRONICALLY, AND IT WAS SORT OF

02:44:07.437 --> 02:44:08.505
ALLUDED TO BY MR. WEDGE EARLIER

02:44:08.572 --> 02:44:11.041
IN READING FROM A SETTLEMENT IN

02:44:11.107 --> 02:44:12.576
THE ELECTRICITY REALM, WHICH IS

02:44:12.642 --> 02:44:15.245
SORT OF AN IRONIC INCONSISTENCY,

02:44:15.312 --> 02:44:16.780
BUT WE'LL LEAVE THAT FOR ANOTHER

02:44:16.846 --> 02:44:19.950
DEBATE. THERE IS, IN FACT, A

02:44:20.016 --> 02:44:22.018
BALANCE OF DATA THAT'S BEEN, I

02:44:22.085 --> 02:44:23.820
THINK, REASONABLY PEER REVIEWED

02:44:23.887 --> 02:44:26.122
AND INTERPRETED ON THE QUESTION

02:44:26.189 --> 02:44:28.925
OF DIFFERENTIAL COMPARISONS, ON

02:44:28.992 --> 02:44:30.594
WHETHER, IN FACT, THE

02:44:30.660 --> 02:44:31.394
APPLICATION OF THIS MECHANISM

02:44:31.461 --> 02:44:33.830
WOULD IN FACT REALIZE BETTER,

02:44:33.897 --> 02:44:35.732
MORE OR LESS INCENTIVE TOWARDS

02:44:35.799 --> 02:44:37.200
CONSERVATION OR MORE OR LESS

02:44:37.267 --> 02:44:39.002
MORE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF

02:44:39.069 --> 02:44:40.103
INCREMENTAL COSTS, DEPENDING ON

02:44:40.170 --> 02:44:41.605
WHAT'S DRIVING THOSE COSTS. AND

02:44:41.671 --> 02:44:43.707
I THINK THE BALANCE OF THE DATA

02:44:43.773 --> 02:44:44.674
HERE SEEMS TO SUGGEST THE

02:44:44.741 --> 02:44:47.043
LATTER. AND AT THE WORST CASE

02:44:47.110 --> 02:44:47.944
SCENARIO, DUE RESPECT TO THE

02:44:48.011 --> 02:44:50.580
GREAT WORK THAT THE POW DOES,

02:44:50.647 --> 02:44:52.315
THEY'VE YOU KNOW, THEIR

02:44:52.382 --> 02:44:53.350
INTERPRETATION OF THE DATA SET

02:44:53.416 --> 02:45:01.424
IS FOCUSED ON PRIMARILY THE

02:45:01.491 --> 02:45:03.893
STUDY, THE PILOT IS THE WORD I

02:45:03.960 --> 02:45:06.029
WAS LOOKING FOR. BUT TO BE

02:45:06.096 --> 02:45:07.364
HONEST, THERE'S ALSO INFORMATION

02:45:07.430 --> 02:45:08.465
THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED TO THIS

02:45:08.531 --> 02:45:09.833
COMMITTEE AND DATA THAT'S IN THE

02:45:09.899 --> 02:45:11.568
RECORD THAT SEEMS TO SUGGEST

02:45:11.635 --> 02:45:12.869
THAT THE BASIS AND METHODOLOGY

02:45:12.936 --> 02:45:14.004
FOR REACHING THOSE CONCLUSIONS

02:45:14.070 --> 02:45:15.672
HAS NOT BEEN FORTHCOMING. AND

02:45:15.739 --> 02:45:17.274
THERE IS YOU'VE ALSO BEEN

02:45:17.340 --> 02:45:20.076
PROVIDED WITH OTHER SECONDARY

02:45:20.143 --> 02:45:22.245
SETS OF DATA ANALYSIS THAT SEEM

02:45:22.312 --> 02:45:23.613
TO CONTRADICT THAT. AND SO I

02:45:23.680 --> 02:45:26.216
THINK AS A MATTER OF POLICY AND

02:45:26.283 --> 02:45:27.183
CONSIDERING LEGISLATIVE

02:45:27.250 --> 02:45:29.119
CONSTRUCT, THE QUESTION ISN'T

02:45:29.185 --> 02:45:30.420
TRYING TO PICK WINNERS AND

02:45:30.487 --> 02:45:32.355
LOSERS ABOUT WHOSE DATA IS BEST,

02:45:32.422 --> 02:45:33.657
BUT THE PREPONDERANCE OF THE

02:45:33.723 --> 02:45:35.825
DATA. DOES IT SEEM TO SUGGEST

02:45:35.892 --> 02:45:38.228
HERE THAT THE BILL WILL PERMIT

02:45:38.295 --> 02:45:40.063
THE APPLICATION OF THIS

02:45:40.130 --> 02:45:42.565
RATEMAKING MECHANISM THAT HAS A

02:45:42.632 --> 02:45:45.135
MORE OR LESS LIKELIHOOD OF EVEN

02:45:45.201 --> 02:45:47.437
HAVING A CHANCE TO ACHIEVE SOME

02:45:47.504 --> 02:45:48.838
BETTER AMOUNT OF INCENTIVE

02:45:48.905 --> 02:45:52.208
TOWARDS CONSERVATION, AND SOME

02:45:52.275 --> 02:45:55.011
BETTER OR NOT IMPACTS TO COSTS.

02:45:55.078 --> 02:45:57.447
I THINK THE BALANCE OF THE DATA

02:45:57.514 --> 02:45:58.515
SEEMS TO SUGGEST THAT IT MAY

02:45:58.581 --> 02:46:01.151
WELL DO THAT, AND THAT'S THE

02:46:01.217 --> 02:46:02.085
REASON FOR THE BILL. ASSEMBLY

02:46:02.152 --> 02:46:04.521
MEMBER ZIPPER, I THINK YOU'RE

02:46:04.587 --> 02:46:05.889
GETTING ACTUALLY TO THE QUESTION

02:46:05.955 --> 02:46:07.924
THAT I HAD, AND THAT WAS SORT OF

02:46:07.991 --> 02:46:08.892
UNDERSTANDING EXACTLY WHAT THIS

02:46:08.958 --> 02:46:11.494
BILL DOES WHEN I READ IT. IT

02:46:11.561 --> 02:46:13.663
SAYS UPON APPLICATION BY WATER

02:46:13.730 --> 02:46:14.631
CORPORATION WITH MORE THAN

02:46:14.698 --> 02:46:15.799
10,000 SERVICE CONNECTIONS, THE

02:46:15.865 --> 02:46:17.967
COMMISSION SHALL CONSIDER AND

02:46:18.034 --> 02:46:20.437
MAY AUTHORIZE THE IMPLEMENTATION

02:46:20.503 --> 02:46:21.137
OF A MECHANISM THAT SEPARATES

02:46:21.204 --> 02:46:22.339
THE WATER CORPORATION'S REVENUES

02:46:22.405 --> 02:46:24.541
IN A SALE THROUGH A DECOUPLING

02:46:24.607 --> 02:46:26.543
MECHANISM, SO THIS DOES NOT

02:46:26.609 --> 02:46:28.478
REQUIRE THAT A DECOUPLING

02:46:28.545 --> 02:46:30.180
MECHANISM BE APPROVED BY THE

02:46:30.246 --> 02:46:31.581
COMMISSION. IT BASICALLY

02:46:31.648 --> 02:46:33.483
REQUIRES THAT THEY CONSIDER AN

02:46:33.550 --> 02:46:34.851
APPLICATION, AND THEN THEY HAVE

02:46:34.918 --> 02:46:36.653
TO GO THROUGH THE TYPICAL

02:46:36.720 --> 02:46:38.455
PROCESS WHERE THEY HEAR FROM ALL

02:46:38.521 --> 02:46:42.092
OF THE STAKEHOLDERS AND, AND

02:46:42.158 --> 02:46:43.893
CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT IT MEETS

02:46:43.960 --> 02:46:46.930
THE GOALS THAT THEY ARE CHARGED

02:46:46.996 --> 02:46:48.598
TO ASSURE ARE MET. AND THEN, OF

02:46:48.665 --> 02:46:51.401
COURSE, THIS BILL, I THINK

02:46:51.468 --> 02:46:55.739
INCLUDES ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARDS

02:46:55.805 --> 02:46:58.241
ABOUT THE DECOUPLING MECHANISM,

02:46:58.308 --> 02:46:59.743
ONE THAT IT BE DESIGNED TO

02:46:59.809 --> 02:47:00.477
ENSURE THAT THERE ARE

02:47:00.543 --> 02:47:01.544
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ACTUAL AND

02:47:01.611 --> 02:47:02.545
AUTHORIZED WATER SALES, DON'T

02:47:02.612 --> 02:47:04.514
RESULT IN OVER RECOVERY UNDER

02:47:04.581 --> 02:47:05.215
RECOVERY. AND AUTHORIZED

02:47:05.281 --> 02:47:06.249
DECOUPLING MECHANISMS SHALL NOT

02:47:06.316 --> 02:47:07.751
ENABLE WATER CORPORATIONS TO

02:47:07.817 --> 02:47:09.219
EARN A REVENUE WINDFALL BY

02:47:09.285 --> 02:47:11.254
ENCOURAGING HIGHER SALES. I SEE

02:47:11.321 --> 02:47:13.123
SOME OTHER LANGUAGE BELOW IT. I

02:47:13.189 --> 02:47:15.859
ASSUME THAT ALL OF THE ISSUES

02:47:15.925 --> 02:47:17.494
RELATED TO EQUITY AND RATE

02:47:17.560 --> 02:47:19.763
STRUCTURE WITH RESPECT TO LOW

02:47:19.829 --> 02:47:21.898
INCOME COMMUNITIES AND ALL OF

02:47:21.965 --> 02:47:24.200
THAT IS AND FAIR ALLOCATION OF

02:47:24.267 --> 02:47:26.202
COST WOULD STILL BE SOMETHING

02:47:26.269 --> 02:47:27.804
THAT IS THAT HAPPENS BEFORE THE

02:47:27.871 --> 02:47:29.572
PUC. NOW, AM I READING THAT

02:47:29.639 --> 02:47:32.876
RIGHT OR IS THAT I MEAN, THIS

02:47:32.942 --> 02:47:35.912
DOESN'T MEAN THAT A BAD RATE

02:47:35.979 --> 02:47:38.014
SYSTEM THAT HAS DECOUPLING WOULD

02:47:38.081 --> 02:47:39.682
BE APPROVED BY THE COMMISSION

02:47:39.749 --> 02:47:40.550
BECAUSE THEY STILL NEED TO MAKE

02:47:40.617 --> 02:47:42.685
ALL THE FINDINGS THEY WOULD NEED

02:47:42.752 --> 02:47:45.255
TO MAKE IN THE NORMAL COURSE. IS

02:47:45.321 --> 02:47:46.156
THAT RIGHT, OR AM I MISSING

02:47:46.222 --> 02:47:47.757
SOMETHING? MADAM CHAIR? AND

02:47:47.824 --> 02:47:49.058
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION.

02:47:49.125 --> 02:47:50.360
ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD AGREE

02:47:50.427 --> 02:47:52.896
WE'RE NOT SEEKING TO REWRITE THE

02:47:52.962 --> 02:47:54.297
GENERAL RATE CASE PROCESS HERE

02:47:54.364 --> 02:47:55.765
OR THE OR, YOU KNOW, DECONSTRUCT

02:47:55.832 --> 02:47:57.834
THE ELEMENTS OF IT. THOSE

02:47:57.901 --> 02:47:59.202
FINDINGS ARE STILL PART OF THAT

02:47:59.269 --> 02:48:01.204
PROCESS, AS YOU WELL KNOW TO

02:48:01.271 --> 02:48:03.840
YOUR POINT. SO I WOULD AGREE AND

02:48:03.907 --> 02:48:05.542
I BUT I WOULD I WOULD CLARIFY

02:48:05.608 --> 02:48:08.178
THAT THE, THE SECTION THAT YOU

02:48:08.244 --> 02:48:09.579
WERE REFERENCING THAT IS

02:48:09.646 --> 02:48:14.250
EXISTING LAW. THE PART ABOUT THE

02:48:14.317 --> 02:48:18.688
AUTHORIZED DECOUPLING. YEAH. THE

02:48:18.755 --> 02:48:20.089
STUFF ON THE BOTTOM. AND YEAH,

02:48:20.156 --> 02:48:21.291
THE COMMISSION SHALL CONSIDER

02:48:21.357 --> 02:48:22.125
AND MAY AUTHORIZE A WATER

02:48:22.192 --> 02:48:24.661
CORPORATION TO ESTABLISH PROGRAM

02:48:24.727 --> 02:48:27.630
THAT'S THAT IS EXISTING LAW. AND

02:48:27.697 --> 02:48:29.632
SO PERHAPS I DON'T KNOW IF THE

02:48:29.699 --> 02:48:30.900
PA WANTS TO COMMENT ON THE

02:48:30.967 --> 02:48:33.036
CHANGE THAT WOULD BE MADE HERE

02:48:33.102 --> 02:48:39.008
IS SEVEN 3910. YEAH, YEAH.

02:48:39.075 --> 02:48:39.642
THAT'S CORRECT. THE VICE CHAIR

02:48:39.709 --> 02:48:42.212
IS GETTING BORED OVER HERE. WOW.

02:48:42.278 --> 02:48:45.281
TRYING TO GET US OUT OF HERE.

02:48:45.348 --> 02:48:47.784
OKAY. THE COMMISSION SHALL

02:48:47.851 --> 02:48:49.419
ENSURE THAT ERRORS IN ESTIMATES

02:48:49.486 --> 02:48:50.954
OF DEMAND ELASTICITY OR SALES DO

02:48:51.020 --> 02:48:52.589
NOT RESULT IN MATERIAL

02:48:52.655 --> 02:48:53.623
OVERCOLLECTION OR UNDER

02:48:53.690 --> 02:48:55.758
COLLECTIONS OF ELECTRICAL OR

02:48:55.825 --> 02:48:57.794
WATER IT ADDS OR WATER

02:48:57.861 --> 02:48:59.395
CORPORATIONS TO THAT. SO BUT ALL

02:48:59.462 --> 02:49:00.830
THOSE PROTECTIONS ARE THERE

02:49:00.897 --> 02:49:02.599
THOUGH. I MEAN, THIS DOES NOT

02:49:02.665 --> 02:49:04.367
REQUIRE THE COMMISSION TO

02:49:04.434 --> 02:49:06.836
APPROVE EVERYTHING. CRAZY. YEAH.

02:49:06.903 --> 02:49:09.005
IT DOESN'T REQUIRE CORRECT A, A

02:49:09.072 --> 02:49:10.840
RATE MECHANISM WITH DECOUPLING.

02:49:10.907 --> 02:49:12.008
THEY STILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH

02:49:12.075 --> 02:49:13.676
THE ENTIRE PROCESS. IS THAT

02:49:13.743 --> 02:49:15.512
ISN'T THAT ACCURATE. THEY WILL

02:49:15.578 --> 02:49:18.214
STILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE,

02:49:18.281 --> 02:49:20.583
YOU KNOW, STANDARD PROCESS OF

02:49:20.650 --> 02:49:22.652
RATE CASE. BUT I MY

02:49:22.719 --> 02:49:23.786
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YES, IT

02:49:23.853 --> 02:49:26.322
WILL REQUIRE THEM WITH, WITH A,

02:49:26.389 --> 02:49:29.292
WITH A USUAL LENS. BUT THEY WILL

02:49:29.359 --> 02:49:31.761
THEY ARE RIGHT NOW ABLE TO

02:49:31.828 --> 02:49:34.531
REJECT AN APPLICATION THAT

02:49:34.597 --> 02:49:36.733
PROPOSES DECOUPLING. THAT

02:49:36.799 --> 02:49:38.768
DISCRETION WILL BE REMOVED BY

02:49:38.835 --> 02:49:41.204
THIS MEASURE. MADAM CHAIR, IF I

02:49:41.271 --> 02:49:42.105
MIGHT, AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER, TO

02:49:42.171 --> 02:49:43.740
YOUR POINT, I MEAN, I THINK THE

02:49:43.806 --> 02:49:45.041
CHAIR JUST ARTICULATED IT. IT'S

02:49:45.108 --> 02:49:46.976
NOT PRESCRIPTIVE OF AN OUTCOME.

02:49:47.043 --> 02:49:50.046
IT IRONICALLY IS AVAILING THIS

02:49:50.113 --> 02:49:51.814
PARTICULAR APPLICATION TO BE

02:49:51.881 --> 02:49:53.950
APPLIED IN THE WATER

02:49:54.017 --> 02:49:55.018
CIRCUMSTANCE IT'S ALREADY BEING

02:49:55.084 --> 02:49:57.987
USED IN, IN OTHER UTILITY

02:49:58.054 --> 02:50:00.790
SCOPES. SO IT'S AND THAT THE

02:50:00.857 --> 02:50:02.058
WORD THAT WAS ARTICULATED BY THE

02:50:02.125 --> 02:50:03.927
CHAIR IS THE KEY WORD THAT YOU

02:50:03.993 --> 02:50:07.263
FOCUSED ON. OKAY. ASSEMBLY

02:50:07.330 --> 02:50:10.934
MEMBER PAPPIN. I'VE GOT I NEED A

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:12.535
LITTLE BIT OF ILLUMINATION ON

02:50:12.602 --> 02:50:15.305
THE TEARS AS IT RELATES TO

02:50:15.371 --> 02:50:16.105
DECOUPLING, BECAUSE YOU TALKED

02:50:16.172 --> 02:50:18.608
ABOUT AGGRESSIVE TEARS. AND THEN

02:50:18.675 --> 02:50:21.110
I WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE FIXED

02:50:21.177 --> 02:50:23.079
RATE WITH USAGE BECAUSE AS I

02:50:23.146 --> 02:50:25.381
RECALL, IF YOU'RE A BIG USER,

02:50:25.448 --> 02:50:27.350
YOU CAN TEAR THE USAGE GRANTED

02:50:27.417 --> 02:50:28.751
MAY NOT GET YOU THE DOLLARS

02:50:28.818 --> 02:50:30.653
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR, BUT YOU CAN

02:50:30.720 --> 02:50:32.922
TEAR THE USAGE. WITH BIG USERS

02:50:32.989 --> 02:50:34.324
BEING CHARGED MORE BECAUSE THEY

02:50:34.390 --> 02:50:35.892
HAVE MORE BURDEN ON THE SYSTEM.

02:50:35.959 --> 02:50:37.226
BUT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE

02:50:37.293 --> 02:50:39.062
DECOUPLING WORKED IN THE IN THE

02:50:39.128 --> 02:50:40.496
TEARS PART OF IT. AND YOU

02:50:40.563 --> 02:50:42.265
MENTIONED, OKAY, AND YOU

02:50:42.332 --> 02:50:44.400
MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT

02:50:44.467 --> 02:50:47.036
AGGRESSIVE TEARING TO MAKE SURE

02:50:47.103 --> 02:50:49.939
THAT YOUR EXTRA INFRASTRUCTURE

02:50:50.006 --> 02:50:54.210
IS COVERED OR PICKED UP OR IS

02:50:54.277 --> 02:50:55.211
MORE EQUITABLE BY THE LARGER

02:50:55.278 --> 02:50:56.946
USERS. SO WALK ME THROUGH THAT

02:50:57.013 --> 02:50:58.381
IF YOU WOULD. OKAY. SO RATE

02:50:58.448 --> 02:50:59.983
DESIGN IS A VERY DIFFICULT THING

02:51:00.049 --> 02:51:01.985
TO DO. I WANT YOU TO SPEAK INTO

02:51:02.051 --> 02:51:03.519
THE MIC JUST A LITTLE LOUDER.

02:51:03.586 --> 02:51:05.288
RATE DESIGN IS A VERY DIFFICULT

02:51:05.355 --> 02:51:06.990
THING TO DO, EVEN FOR THE CPUC,

02:51:07.056 --> 02:51:07.824
AND IT'S ALL REVIEWED. I'LL

02:51:07.890 --> 02:51:09.759
STIPULATE THAT THE CPUC IS GOING

02:51:09.826 --> 02:51:10.860
TO BE A BACKSTOP HERE, AND

02:51:10.927 --> 02:51:12.562
THEY'RE GOING TO REVIEW IT IN

02:51:12.629 --> 02:51:13.830
THE RATE CASE I GOT THAT AND

02:51:13.896 --> 02:51:15.665
DISCRETION IS REMOVED OKAY. SO

02:51:15.732 --> 02:51:18.001
THE WAY WE USED TO DO RATE

02:51:18.067 --> 02:51:18.768
MAKING IN THE OLD DAYS, AND AS

02:51:18.835 --> 02:51:19.902
ASSEMBLYMAN PATTERSON MENTIONED,

02:51:19.969 --> 02:51:21.537
THEY HAD A SERVICE CHARGE. AND

02:51:21.604 --> 02:51:23.706
YOU HAVE ONE TIER. SO YOU PAY A

02:51:23.773 --> 02:51:25.174
SERVICE CHARGE EVERY MONTH, A

02:51:25.241 --> 02:51:27.176
READINESS TO SERVE CHARGE AND

02:51:27.243 --> 02:51:29.545
ONE TIER FOR WATER. THAT SERVICE

02:51:29.612 --> 02:51:30.980
CHARGE IS JUST, YOU KNOW, FIXED

02:51:31.047 --> 02:51:32.782
AMOUNT, YOU KNOW, $50. THEN YOU

02:51:32.849 --> 02:51:35.184
PAY, SAY, 3 OR $4 PER SERVICE

02:51:35.251 --> 02:51:37.754
TIER. NOW, WHEN YOU INTRODUCE

02:51:37.820 --> 02:51:40.523
ADDITIONAL TIERS TO THREE OR

02:51:40.590 --> 02:51:43.459
EVEN FOUR TIERS, THAT CREATES A

02:51:43.526 --> 02:51:46.362
LOT OF REVENUE UNCERTAINTY

02:51:46.429 --> 02:51:48.765
BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW AS WATER

02:51:48.831 --> 02:51:51.100
UTILITY HOW MUCH WATER PRECISELY

02:51:51.167 --> 02:51:53.636
WILL BE SOLD AT EACH TIER. FOR

02:51:53.703 --> 02:51:55.505
EXAMPLE, IF YOU HAVE A BIG,

02:51:55.571 --> 02:51:56.773
BEAUTIFUL LAWN AND YOUR SPOUSE

02:51:56.839 --> 02:51:58.274
SAYS, I DIDN'T LIKE OUR WATER

02:51:58.341 --> 02:51:59.942
BILL LAST TIME AND YOU TAKE OUT

02:52:00.009 --> 02:52:01.577
THAT LAWN, ALL OF A SUDDEN YOUR

02:52:01.644 --> 02:52:03.846
WATER USAGE WILL FALL. SO THE

02:52:03.913 --> 02:52:05.715
PROJECTION WE HAD AT THE HIGHER

02:52:05.782 --> 02:52:08.384
TIER DOESN'T MATERIALIZE FOR

02:52:08.451 --> 02:52:10.687
THAT FOR US. AND IF YOU MULTIPLY

02:52:10.753 --> 02:52:13.322
THAT OVER 500,000 CUSTOMERS,

02:52:13.389 --> 02:52:15.258
THAT ADDS UP TO BE A LOT. SO

02:52:15.324 --> 02:52:17.627
THAT REVENUE INSTABILITY THAT IS

02:52:17.694 --> 02:52:20.930
CAUSED BY HAVING TIERED RATES,

02:52:20.997 --> 02:52:22.632
DECOUPLING ALLOWS YOU TO ADDRESS

02:52:22.699 --> 02:52:24.267
THAT. BECAUSE IF YOUR REVENUES

02:52:24.333 --> 02:52:26.335
DON'T MATERIALIZE FOR ALL THOSE

02:52:26.402 --> 02:52:28.137
CAPITAL PROJECTS YOU ARE

02:52:28.204 --> 02:52:30.073
PLANNING, THEN YOU CAN GO BACK

02:52:30.139 --> 02:52:31.574
AFTER THE END OF THE YEAR. AND

02:52:31.641 --> 02:52:34.577
TRUE THAT UP. AND SO WITHOUT

02:52:34.644 --> 02:52:36.112
DECOUPLING WHAT'S HAPPENED RIGHT

02:52:36.179 --> 02:52:37.880
NOW AT THE CPUC IN THE MOST

02:52:37.947 --> 02:52:39.582
RECENT GENERAL RATE CASES THAT

02:52:39.649 --> 02:52:41.117
THEY'VE AUTHORIZED, BASICALLY

02:52:41.184 --> 02:52:42.819
THE SERVICE CHARGES HAVE BEEN

02:52:42.885 --> 02:52:46.723
GOING UP AND THE TIERS ARE THEIR

02:52:46.789 --> 02:52:48.658
PRICES ARE GOING UP AS WELL,

02:52:48.725 --> 02:52:50.393
WITH MORE DOLLARS ALLOCATED TO

02:52:50.460 --> 02:52:53.062
LOWER TIERS, WHICH IS NOT GOOD

02:52:53.129 --> 02:52:55.431
FOR AN ELDERLY COUPLE, OR MORE

02:52:55.498 --> 02:52:58.501
FIXED DOLLARS MORE. THE RATES

02:52:58.568 --> 02:53:00.970
ARE GOING UP AT THE LOWER TIERS

02:53:01.037 --> 02:53:04.107
BECAUSE THAT REDUCES REVENUE AND

02:53:04.173 --> 02:53:06.142
INSTABILITY. SO WITHOUT

02:53:06.209 --> 02:53:07.310
DECOUPLING, THAT'S WHAT'S GOING

02:53:07.376 --> 02:53:08.778
TO HAPPEN. AND IT'S HAPPENING

02:53:08.845 --> 02:53:10.246
TODAY. YES. BUT HOW DO YOU DEAL

02:53:10.313 --> 02:53:12.749
WITH BIG WATER USERS IF YOU'RE

02:53:12.815 --> 02:53:15.184
DECOUPLING? SO THE BEST WAY TO

02:53:15.251 --> 02:53:16.452
GET CONSERVATION I'VE SAID THIS

02:53:16.519 --> 02:53:18.287
ALL MY CAREER IS JUST TO RAISE

02:53:18.354 --> 02:53:19.922
THE PRICE. SO IF YOU HAVE A

02:53:19.989 --> 02:53:22.825
LARGE WATER USER, EVERYBODY

02:53:22.892 --> 02:53:24.260
EVENTUALLY WILL BE PRICE

02:53:24.327 --> 02:53:26.028
SENSITIVE. SO WHAT WE HAVE SEEN

02:53:26.095 --> 02:53:29.332
IN INDUSTRY WIDE IS HIGHER RATES

02:53:29.398 --> 02:53:31.400
RESULT IN GREATER CONSERVATION.

02:53:31.467 --> 02:53:34.437
HOWEVER, IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO

02:53:34.504 --> 02:53:36.139
PREDICT HOW MUCH WATER WILL BE

02:53:36.205 --> 02:53:38.007
SOLD AT THOSE RATES. WE ALSO

02:53:38.074 --> 02:53:39.609
HAVE SEEN THAT WHEN YOU RAISE

02:53:39.675 --> 02:53:41.244
THE RATES A LOT FOLKS WILL TAKE

02:53:41.310 --> 02:53:42.512
OUT THEIR LAWNS. THEY'LL STOP

02:53:42.578 --> 02:53:43.946
WASHING THEIR CARS, THEY'LL DO

02:53:44.013 --> 02:53:46.382
OTHER THINGS SO THEY DON'T PAY

02:53:46.449 --> 02:53:47.083
THOSE HIGHER RATES. BUT WHAT

02:53:47.150 --> 02:53:50.787
DOES THAT DO FOR PURPOSES OF

02:53:50.853 --> 02:53:52.255
INFRASTRUCTURE JOBS THAT YOU

02:53:52.321 --> 02:53:55.158
NEEDED TO DO? AND YEAH, SO YOU

02:53:55.224 --> 02:53:57.226
HAVE TO DO YOUR TRUE UP. THAT'S

02:53:57.293 --> 02:53:58.461
RIGHT. WITHOUT DECOUPLING. SO

02:53:58.528 --> 02:54:00.163
THOSE REVENUES THAT SHOULD HAVE

02:54:00.229 --> 02:54:01.664
MATERIALIZED AT THOSE HIGHER

02:54:01.731 --> 02:54:03.432
TIERS, THEY DON'T MATERIALIZE.

02:54:03.499 --> 02:54:05.802
SO THAT MEANS THE UTILITY TAKES

02:54:05.868 --> 02:54:08.237
IN LESS DOLLARS. RIGHT. AND YOU

02:54:08.304 --> 02:54:09.839
GO TO YOUR NEXT GENERAL RATE

02:54:09.906 --> 02:54:11.741
CASE THREE YEARS LATER AND YOU

02:54:11.808 --> 02:54:13.543
SAY YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT DIDN'T

02:54:13.609 --> 02:54:14.877
WORK FOR US, DIDN'T MATERIALIZE.

02:54:14.944 --> 02:54:16.746
WE DIDN'T HAVE AS MUCH MONEY TO

02:54:16.813 --> 02:54:19.382
DO OUR PROJECTS. WE NEED TO

02:54:19.448 --> 02:54:22.151
CHANGE THE TIERS. SO IT CREATES

02:54:22.218 --> 02:54:24.320
A LAG IN THE PROCESS, IF YOU

02:54:24.387 --> 02:54:30.092
WILL. BECAUSE YOU WANT TO ANSWER

02:54:30.159 --> 02:54:34.197
YES. I WILL AGREE THAT THE RATE

02:54:34.263 --> 02:54:36.265
SETTING PROCESS IS A COMPLICATED

02:54:36.332 --> 02:54:38.034
PROCESS, AND IT'S A QUITE

02:54:38.100 --> 02:54:39.602
INVOLVED, AND IT'S DONE WITHIN

02:54:39.669 --> 02:54:43.472
AN EVIDENTIARY RECORD. WE HAVE

02:54:43.539 --> 02:54:47.410
NOT SEEN THE RESULTS THAT HAVE

02:54:47.476 --> 02:54:48.911
BEEN INDICATED, AT LEAST NOT

02:54:48.978 --> 02:54:51.747
DURING THE TEN YEAR PILOT STUDY.

02:54:51.814 --> 02:54:53.282
SO IF YOU DON'T COLLECT ENOUGH,

02:54:53.349 --> 02:54:54.817
THEN YOU GOT TO GO COLLECT SOME

02:54:54.884 --> 02:54:57.286
MORE ON THE NEXT GO ROUND. FAIR

02:54:57.353 --> 02:54:58.554
TO SAY THAT'S RIGHT. OR WE DON'T

02:54:58.621 --> 02:55:01.090
DO SOME PROJECTS WE HAD PLANNED.

02:55:01.157 --> 02:55:02.291
YES. OR YOU DON'T DO THE PROJECT

02:55:02.358 --> 02:55:06.295
YOU PLAN SOMETIMES. THANK YOU,

02:55:06.362 --> 02:55:10.099
MADAM CHAIR. I HAVE A COUPLE. I

02:55:10.166 --> 02:55:12.168
HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. SO

02:55:12.235 --> 02:55:14.003
FIRST, HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT, IF

02:55:14.070 --> 02:55:16.439
AT ALL? HOW IS THIS PROPOSED

02:55:16.505 --> 02:55:17.874
DECOUPLING MECHANISM DIFFERENT,

02:55:17.940 --> 02:55:22.245
IF AT ALL, FROM THE WAY IN WHICH

02:55:22.311 --> 02:55:24.780
OUR ELECTRIC UTILITIES OPERATE

02:55:24.847 --> 02:55:27.149
CURRENTLY? IS IT IS THIS THE

02:55:27.216 --> 02:55:29.552
SAME? IS THIS PROPOSAL BEFORE US

02:55:29.619 --> 02:55:31.621
THE SAME, OR ARE THERE MATERIAL

02:55:31.687 --> 02:55:33.522
DIFFERENCES? YES. IT WOULD

02:55:33.589 --> 02:55:36.525
REPLICATE IDENTICALLY WHAT'S

02:55:36.592 --> 02:55:37.960
HAPPENING IN ENERGY RATES FOR

02:55:38.027 --> 02:55:40.963
WATER. YES. OKAY. AND I WILL

02:55:41.030 --> 02:55:44.033
JUST ADD IT IS CHALLENGING TO

02:55:44.100 --> 02:55:45.735
COMPARE THE TWO JUST BECAUSE OF

02:55:45.801 --> 02:55:47.870
THE HISTORY OF ENERGY

02:55:47.937 --> 02:55:49.005
DECOUPLING. I THINK THE ANALYSIS

02:55:49.071 --> 02:55:50.573
DOES A REALLY GREAT JOB OF

02:55:50.640 --> 02:55:53.276
OUTLINING THE HISTORY OF THE SAM

02:55:53.342 --> 02:55:57.513
OF THE IRAM 1982. THE CPUC

02:55:57.580 --> 02:55:59.048
IMPLEMENTED, I BELIEVE IT'S 1982

02:55:59.115 --> 02:56:01.117
IMPLEMENTED DECOUPLING IN ENERGY

02:56:01.183 --> 02:56:03.753
RATES IN RESPONSE TO THE

02:56:03.819 --> 02:56:04.954
HISTORICAL CONTEXT OF WHERE WE

02:56:05.021 --> 02:56:05.755
WERE WITH RATES AND

02:56:05.821 --> 02:56:07.623
AFFORDABILITY AT THE TIME.

02:56:07.690 --> 02:56:08.925
OBVIOUSLY, A LOT HAS CHANGED

02:56:08.991 --> 02:56:10.660
SINCE 1982. THE WAY THAT WE

02:56:10.726 --> 02:56:11.928
STRUCTURE OUR ENERGY RATES, OUR

02:56:11.994 --> 02:56:12.995
WATER RATES AND THE CHALLENGES

02:56:13.062 --> 02:56:15.898
HAVE CHANGED WITH THEM. AND SO

02:56:15.965 --> 02:56:17.700
WE DIDN'T AT THE TIME, TO MY

02:56:17.767 --> 02:56:19.902
KNOWLEDGE, STUDY DECOUPLING IN

02:56:19.969 --> 02:56:22.038
ENERGY RATES THE WAY BEFORE

02:56:22.104 --> 02:56:22.638
IMPLEMENTING IT, I SHOULD SAY

02:56:22.705 --> 02:56:24.674
THE WAY THAT WE HAVE STUDIED

02:56:24.740 --> 02:56:26.876
DECOUPLING IN WATER RATES, TEN

02:56:26.943 --> 02:56:29.545
YEARS WORTH OF DATA IS A LOT OF

02:56:29.612 --> 02:56:30.212
DATA TO OPERATE, ESPECIALLY

02:56:30.279 --> 02:56:32.782
GIVEN THAT WE CAN COMPARE AND

02:56:32.848 --> 02:56:35.351
CONTRAST TO PRIOR TO AND AFTER.

02:56:35.418 --> 02:56:37.653
I HOPE THAT HELPS. OKAY. AND

02:56:37.720 --> 02:56:39.422
THEN LET ME ASK A QUESTION.

02:56:39.488 --> 02:56:42.892
SOMEONE ASKED A QUESTION ABOUT

02:56:42.959 --> 02:56:45.194
PROFITS AND HOW PROFITS WILL OR

02:56:45.261 --> 02:56:48.631
WILL NOT CHANGE UNDER THIS

02:56:48.698 --> 02:56:54.036
PROPOSAL. SO. TODAY IF YOU IF I

02:56:54.103 --> 02:56:56.572
GO IN TO MAKE MY RATE CASE AND I

02:56:56.639 --> 02:57:00.576
SAY MY FORECAST IS $100, BUT I

02:57:00.643 --> 02:57:03.379
ONLY ACTUALLY END UP COLLECTING

02:57:03.446 --> 02:57:06.615
$90, THEN I GET $90, I DON'T GET

02:57:06.682 --> 02:57:09.852
$100, RIGHT. SO UNDER THIS

02:57:09.919 --> 02:57:11.687
MECHANISM, IF I GO IN AND I SAY

02:57:11.754 --> 02:57:14.590
MY FORECAST IS $100, I THEN I'M

02:57:14.657 --> 02:57:17.126
AUTHORIZED TO SORT OF SET ALL OF

02:57:17.193 --> 02:57:17.693
MY RATES AND MY COLLECTION

02:57:17.760 --> 02:57:18.761
SCHEDULE. SO I'M DEFINITELY

02:57:18.828 --> 02:57:22.064
GOING TO GET $100. WHAT IF I

02:57:22.131 --> 02:57:26.168
ONLY SPEND $90? WHERE DOES THAT

02:57:26.235 --> 02:57:33.275
$10 GO? ACCREDITED SHAREHOLDERS.

02:57:33.342 --> 02:57:37.680
YEAH WE. THE RATE MAKING. THAT'S

02:57:37.747 --> 02:57:39.382
A GREAT QUESTION. BUT IT'S

02:57:39.448 --> 02:57:40.549
UNFORTUNATELY A BIT TOO SIMPLE.

02:57:40.616 --> 02:57:42.718
IT'S SIMPLE. I WAS TRYING TO DO

02:57:42.785 --> 02:57:45.721
SIMPLE MATH AND I'M YES YOU GUYS

02:57:45.788 --> 02:57:46.522
YOU GUYS CAN'T AGREE ON THE

02:57:46.589 --> 02:57:47.590
COMPLICATED MATH. SO I'M TRYING

02:57:47.656 --> 02:57:49.525
TO BREAK THE SIMPLE MATH DOWN A

02:57:49.592 --> 02:57:50.793
LITTLE BIT FOR YOU. RATEMAKING

02:57:50.860 --> 02:57:51.894
IS DONE OVER A THREE YEAR

02:57:51.961 --> 02:57:54.230
PERIOD. YOU HAVE A TEST YEAR AND

02:57:54.296 --> 02:57:55.464
TWO ATTRITION YEARS. WHAT WE DO,

02:57:55.531 --> 02:57:57.066
WHAT THE CPU DOES, CPUC DOES, IS

02:57:57.133 --> 02:57:59.135
SET OUR TEST YEAR RATES AND OUR

02:57:59.201 --> 02:58:00.436
NEXT TWO YEARS RATES. HOWEVER,

02:58:00.503 --> 02:58:02.071
WE DON'T GET THOSE NEXT TWO YEAR

02:58:02.138 --> 02:58:04.173
RATES IF WE DON'T INVEST AS MUCH

02:58:04.240 --> 02:58:06.409
MONEY AS THEY'VE GIVEN US IN

02:58:06.475 --> 02:58:08.010
INFRASTRUCTURE. LET'S GO BACK TO

02:58:08.077 --> 02:58:09.645
PROFIT. THIS IS REALLY EASY. THE

02:58:09.712 --> 02:58:11.514
CPUC SETS REVENUE REQUIREMENT,

02:58:11.580 --> 02:58:13.582
WE RECOVER ALL OUR COSTS AND WE

02:58:13.649 --> 02:58:15.384
EARN A RATE OF RETURN. THAT'S

02:58:15.451 --> 02:58:19.288
THE PROFIT ON OUR INVESTED

02:58:19.355 --> 02:58:23.426
CAPITAL, RIGHT? IF WE IF WE MAKE

02:58:23.492 --> 02:58:25.194
ALL OUR INVESTMENTS, WE'LL GET

02:58:25.261 --> 02:58:26.896
THAT RETURN. IF WE DO NOT RUN

02:58:26.962 --> 02:58:29.098
OUR BUSINESS WELL, IF WE EXCEED

02:58:29.165 --> 02:58:31.000
THE EXPENSES AUTHORIZED AND DO

02:58:31.067 --> 02:58:33.469
NOT RECEIVE RECOVERY, WE WON'T

02:58:33.536 --> 02:58:34.937
MAKE ANY PROFIT AND MY

02:58:35.004 --> 02:58:36.672
MANAGEMENT TEAM WILL BE OUT OF A

02:58:36.739 --> 02:58:38.074
JOB. THAT'S JUST HOW IT WORKS.

02:58:38.140 --> 02:58:41.744
SO PROFIT CAN BE MEASURED BY HOW

02:58:41.811 --> 02:58:44.480
YOU PERFORM AS A AS A UTILITY.

02:58:44.547 --> 02:58:46.348
RIGHT? THAT'S PERFORMANCE OF THE

02:58:46.415 --> 02:58:48.184
BUSINESS PERFORMANCE OF THE

02:58:48.250 --> 02:58:48.951
MANAGERS. AND THAT'S WHERE

02:58:49.018 --> 02:58:51.153
PROFIT COMES FROM. THAT PROFIT

02:58:51.220 --> 02:58:52.588
THAT WE THAT RATE OF RETURN THAT

02:58:52.655 --> 02:58:55.057
WE GET GOES TO DO OUR DEBT

02:58:55.124 --> 02:58:56.859
SERVICE. WE BORROW A LOT OF

02:58:56.926 --> 02:58:58.227
MONEY TO DO INFRASTRUCTURE

02:58:58.294 --> 02:59:00.496
IMPROVEMENT. IT GOES TO PAY

02:59:00.563 --> 02:59:01.831
DIVIDENDS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS

02:59:01.897 --> 02:59:04.066
WHO ALSO PROVIDE CAPITAL FOR

02:59:04.133 --> 02:59:05.067
INFRASTRUCTURE. MY COMPANY, THE

02:59:05.134 --> 02:59:07.336
LARGEST AND SECOND LARGEST IOU

02:59:07.403 --> 02:59:10.306
IN CALIFORNIA. WE DO ABOUT 404

02:59:10.372 --> 02:59:11.307
TO 500 MILLION IN CAPITAL

02:59:11.373 --> 02:59:13.442
INVESTMENTS EVERY YEAR. AND WE

02:59:13.509 --> 02:59:15.778
HAVE TO DO THAT BECAUSE OUR

02:59:15.845 --> 02:59:19.048
INFRASTRUCTURE IS OLD AND AGING,

02:59:19.115 --> 02:59:19.849
RIGHT. BUT THAT'S I MEAN,

02:59:19.915 --> 02:59:22.084
EVERYTHING YOU SAID IS WHAT

02:59:22.151 --> 02:59:25.688
HAPPENS TODAY. SO AND DOES THIS

02:59:25.754 --> 02:59:28.290
NOT CHANGE THAT CALCULATION THAT

02:59:28.357 --> 02:59:30.926
ONE MORE IF THE REGULATOR GIVES

02:59:30.993 --> 02:59:32.561
ME X DOLLARS AND I DON'T SPEND

02:59:32.628 --> 02:59:34.497
THOSE X DOLLARS BECAUSE THEY

02:59:34.563 --> 02:59:36.899
GAVE ME TOO MUCH. YES, THAT'S

02:59:36.966 --> 02:59:38.634
THE QUESTION. THE NEXT RATE

02:59:38.701 --> 02:59:40.970
CYCLE THE REGULATOR IS GOING TO

02:59:41.036 --> 02:59:42.972
TELL ME, HEY, WE LOOK BACK AT

02:59:43.038 --> 02:59:44.206
THE LAST THREE YEARS, WE GAVE

02:59:44.273 --> 02:59:47.576
YOU X, YOU SPENT Y NEXT, THE

02:59:47.643 --> 02:59:49.845
NEXT THREE YEARS, YOU'RE NOT

02:59:49.912 --> 02:59:51.313
GOING TO GET THAT MONEY. SO

02:59:51.380 --> 02:59:52.581
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS RIGHT? OKAY.

02:59:52.648 --> 02:59:55.484
SO IT POSSIBLY CREATES AN

02:59:55.551 --> 02:59:57.653
INCENTIVE FOR AGGRESSIVE

02:59:57.720 --> 02:59:59.955
FORECASTING ON A, YOU KNOW,

03:00:00.022 --> 03:00:03.659
SINGLE CYCLE BASIS WHICH THEN.

03:00:03.726 --> 03:00:05.594
GETS CHEWED UP. I CAN DO AT THE

03:00:05.661 --> 03:00:07.396
END. I CAN DO ALL THE

03:00:07.463 --> 03:00:08.931
FORECASTING I WANT AT THE END OF

03:00:08.998 --> 03:00:11.400
THE DAY, THE CPC DETERMINES WHAT

03:00:11.467 --> 03:00:13.569
I RECOVER, WHAT MY FORECAST IS

03:00:13.636 --> 03:00:14.803
FOR SALES, HOW MUCH MONEY I'M

03:00:14.870 --> 03:00:16.539
GOING TO SPEND, WHAT CAPITAL

03:00:16.605 --> 03:00:17.973
IMPROVEMENTS ARE DEEMED

03:00:18.040 --> 03:00:20.843
REASONABLE. ALL RIGHT. AND I'M

03:00:20.910 --> 03:00:21.844
SORRY, SIR, WHEN DID YOU SERVE

03:00:21.911 --> 03:00:24.113
ON THE CPUC? WAS IT WHEN WERE

03:00:24.180 --> 03:00:25.881
YOU ON THE CPUC? OH, I NEVER

03:00:25.948 --> 03:00:27.683
SERVED ON THE COMMISSION. I WAS

03:00:27.750 --> 03:00:30.152
A STAFFER AT THE CPUC SINCE

03:00:30.219 --> 03:00:31.520
1988. I SERVED AS THE WATER

03:00:31.587 --> 03:00:35.391
DIVISION DIRECTOR FROM 2007 TO

03:00:35.457 --> 03:00:37.993
2019. I WAS A COAUTHOR OF THE

03:00:38.060 --> 03:00:39.528
2005 WATER ACTION PLAN, WHICH

03:00:39.595 --> 03:00:41.630
WAS ADOPTED BY THE FIVE MEMBER

03:00:41.697 --> 03:00:43.065
COMMISSION UNANIMOUSLY. THAT

03:00:43.132 --> 03:00:45.501
WATER ACTION PLAN WAS UPDATED IN

03:00:45.568 --> 03:00:47.803
2010. THAT WAS AGAIN ADOPTED

03:00:47.870 --> 03:00:50.272
UNANIMOUSLY BY THE COMMISSION.

03:00:50.339 --> 03:00:52.007
SO YOU WERE THE WATER DIRECTOR

03:00:52.074 --> 03:00:56.512
AT THE CPUC WHEN THE CPUC VOTED

03:00:56.579 --> 03:00:58.614
TO ELIMINATE THE RAM? NO, I WAS

03:00:58.681 --> 03:01:02.184
NOT THERE IN 2020 WHEN THE CPUC

03:01:02.251 --> 03:01:03.152
ELIMINATED THE RAM. THAT'S

03:01:03.219 --> 03:01:06.155
CORRECT. OKAY, OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

03:01:06.222 --> 03:01:07.590
BUT YOU WERE THERE WHEN THEY

03:01:07.656 --> 03:01:10.960
WERE DOING THIS PILOT PROJECT.

03:01:11.026 --> 03:01:12.561
WE PUT IN DECOUPLING. YEAH.

03:01:12.628 --> 03:01:17.066
OKAY. YES. ALL RIGHT. ASSEMBLY

03:01:17.132 --> 03:01:20.236
MEMBER ROGERS. THANK YOU SO

03:01:20.302 --> 03:01:21.904
MUCH, CHAIR. AND YOU KIND OF GOT

03:01:21.971 --> 03:01:23.706
EXACTLY TO MY QUESTION, AND I'M

03:01:23.772 --> 03:01:25.574
STILL TRYING TO WORK THROUGH

03:01:25.641 --> 03:01:28.310
THIS, BUT ESSENTIALLY THERE IS

03:01:28.377 --> 03:01:33.115
AN INCENTIVE FOR OVER INFLATION

03:01:33.182 --> 03:01:38.120
OF WATER. THE SALES FORECASTS.

03:01:38.187 --> 03:01:40.389
BUT YOU'RE SAYING, SIR, THAT YOU

03:01:40.456 --> 03:01:42.658
THINK THAT THAT IS OVERBLOWN

03:01:42.725 --> 03:01:44.493
BECAUSE THREE YEARS LATER, WHEN

03:01:44.560 --> 03:01:47.096
THEY GO BACK THROUGH FOR THEIR

03:01:47.162 --> 03:01:49.632
NEXT GASP, THAT THAT WILL BE

03:01:49.698 --> 03:01:52.701
TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. SO OKAY,

03:01:52.768 --> 03:01:54.770
LET'S GO TO THE SALES FORECAST.

03:01:54.837 --> 03:01:58.607
SO A WATER UTILITIES ARE NOT

03:01:58.674 --> 03:02:00.809
INCENTIVIZED TO OVER FORECAST

03:02:00.876 --> 03:02:02.745
WATER SALES. THE PUBLIC

03:02:02.811 --> 03:02:04.780
ADVOCATE'S CONSUMER ADVOCATES

03:02:04.847 --> 03:02:07.283
ARE INCENTIVIZED TO OVER

03:02:07.349 --> 03:02:09.184
FORECAST SALES. WHAT HAPPENS IS

03:02:09.251 --> 03:02:11.787
THAT. SO IF YOU FORECAST TOO

03:02:11.854 --> 03:02:13.689
MUCH SALES YOU HAVE LOWER RATES.

03:02:13.756 --> 03:02:14.723
IF YOU UNDER FORECAST SALES, YOU

03:02:14.790 --> 03:02:16.692
HAVE HIGHER RATES. THE CPUC

03:02:16.759 --> 03:02:17.860
LOOKS AT THE FORECAST THAT THE

03:02:17.926 --> 03:02:19.028
PARTIES SUBMIT THE UTILITIES,

03:02:19.094 --> 03:02:21.697
THE RATEPAYER ADVOCATES, AND

03:02:21.764 --> 03:02:22.898
DETERMINES WHAT A REASONABLE

03:02:22.965 --> 03:02:26.402
FORECAST IS. PREDICTING WATER

03:02:26.468 --> 03:02:28.537
SALES FORECASTS IS REALLY HARD

03:02:28.604 --> 03:02:31.407
WORK, AND IT'S INEVITABLY WRONG.

03:02:31.473 --> 03:02:33.142
JUST IT JUST ALWAYS IS. IT'S

03:02:33.208 --> 03:02:35.477
NEVER EXACTLY SPOT ON BECAUSE WE

03:02:35.544 --> 03:02:36.879
CAN'T PREDICT THE WEATHER THREE

03:02:36.945 --> 03:02:39.948
YEARS OUT. YEAH, I THINK WHAT I

03:02:40.015 --> 03:02:41.016
AM STILL STRUGGLING WITH A

03:02:41.083 --> 03:02:42.584
LITTLE BIT, AND I THINK THE

03:02:42.651 --> 03:02:45.054
CHAIR WAS GETTING AT THIS AS

03:02:45.120 --> 03:02:45.721
WELL, IS UNDERSTANDING THAT THE

03:02:45.788 --> 03:02:48.190
FORECAST IS WRONG. I, AND I

03:02:48.257 --> 03:02:49.992
IMAGINE MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES

03:02:50.059 --> 03:02:51.527
PREFER THAT WHEN A FORECAST IS

03:02:51.593 --> 03:02:52.928
WRONG, THAT THE CONSUMER

03:02:52.995 --> 03:02:54.296
BENEFITS FROM IT, ESPECIALLY IN

03:02:54.363 --> 03:02:59.168
A PRIVATE WATER UTILITY SYSTEM.

03:02:59.234 --> 03:03:01.103
WHAT YOU DOING OVER THERE?

03:03:01.170 --> 03:03:08.110
GONZALEZ. IT'S NOT. SO I THINK

03:03:08.177 --> 03:03:10.145
JUST TO GET DIRECTLY TO THE

03:03:10.212 --> 03:03:11.947
POINT, HOW ARE LEGISLATORS

03:03:12.014 --> 03:03:14.216
VOTING FOR THIS GOING TO BE

03:03:14.283 --> 03:03:15.617
FEELING SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT

03:03:15.684 --> 03:03:18.387
PADDING THE POCKETS OF PRIVATE

03:03:18.454 --> 03:03:19.988
INVESTORS AT THE BEHEST OF

03:03:20.055 --> 03:03:24.360
EITHER WORKERS OR OR THE

03:03:24.426 --> 03:03:25.828
RATEPAYERS? SO DECOUPLING MAKES

03:03:25.894 --> 03:03:27.629
YOU GIVE THAT MONEY BACK TO THE

03:03:27.696 --> 03:03:28.764
RATEPAYERS. AND IT'S WORKED ON.

03:03:28.831 --> 03:03:30.933
THE WATER'S ON THE ELECTRIC

03:03:30.999 --> 03:03:32.101
SIDE, ON THE GAS SIDE. AND WHY

03:03:32.167 --> 03:03:33.969
NOT THE WATER SIDE? SO I'M

03:03:34.036 --> 03:03:35.604
SEEING SHAKING HEADS FROM THE

03:03:35.671 --> 03:03:37.840
PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE IF YOU

03:03:37.906 --> 03:03:43.112
WANT TO. WELL, YEAH. LOOK, IF

03:03:43.178 --> 03:03:44.513
YOU READ THE BILLS, ONLY TWO

03:03:44.580 --> 03:03:46.648
PAGES AND IN THREE DIFFERENT

03:03:46.715 --> 03:03:47.616
SPOTS, IT MAKES IT CRYSTAL CLEAR

03:03:47.683 --> 03:03:50.919
THAT ANY, ANY OVERCOLLECTION HAS

03:03:50.986 --> 03:03:52.354
TO BE RETURNED TO THE RATEPAYER.

03:03:52.421 --> 03:03:54.656
SO THEN BASICALLY THE QUESTION

03:03:54.723 --> 03:03:56.625
IS, ARE YOU SATISFIED THAT THE

03:03:56.692 --> 03:03:58.794
IT GETS TO THE, THE PROCESS THAT

03:03:58.861 --> 03:04:00.596
THE PUC DETERMINES WHAT THAT

03:04:00.662 --> 03:04:02.865
REVENUE LIMIT IS? AND IT'S NOT A

03:04:02.931 --> 03:04:05.000
PERFECT PROCESS, BUT WE HAVE ALL

03:04:05.067 --> 03:04:05.834
THE STAKEHOLDERS, INCLUDING MY

03:04:05.901 --> 03:04:07.403
CLIENTS WHO PARTICIPATE IN THAT

03:04:07.469 --> 03:04:10.372
PUC SETS THAT REVENUE LIMIT. AND

03:04:10.439 --> 03:04:12.207
IF THEY OVERCORRECT UNDER THIS

03:04:12.274 --> 03:04:14.977
BILL, IT GOES BACK OKAY. I'M

03:04:15.043 --> 03:04:17.312
HAPPY TO JUST IF IT'S ALL RIGHT,

03:04:17.379 --> 03:04:18.680
MADAM CHAIR, POINT TO THAT

03:04:18.747 --> 03:04:20.716
SECTION OF THE BILL. ANY CHANGE

03:04:20.783 --> 03:04:22.985
TO A RATE FOR WATER SERVICE OR

03:04:23.051 --> 03:04:23.952
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A

03:04:24.019 --> 03:04:26.255
SURCHARGE ON WATER SERVICE IN

03:04:26.321 --> 03:04:28.757
ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 739.10,

03:04:28.824 --> 03:04:30.726
SHALL NOT RESULT IN REVENUES

03:04:30.793 --> 03:04:32.628
ABOVE THOSE APPROVED BY THE

03:04:32.694 --> 03:04:35.564
COMMISSION. REVENUES, NOT

03:04:35.631 --> 03:04:37.800
PROFITS. WE SUGGESTED AN

03:04:37.866 --> 03:04:38.901
AMENDMENT THAT WOULD CHANGE THE

03:04:38.967 --> 03:04:39.768
WORD. I'M SORRY I CAN'T TURN

03:04:39.835 --> 03:04:41.103
AROUND. ASSEMBLYMEMBER, TO LOOK

03:04:41.170 --> 03:04:42.905
AT YOU. I HOPE YOU KNOW I'M

03:04:42.971 --> 03:04:44.807
TALKING TO YOU. WE SUGGESTED AN

03:04:44.873 --> 03:04:46.141
AMENDMENT IN THE SENATE THAT

03:04:46.208 --> 03:04:47.376
WOULD CHANGE THE WORD REVENUES

03:04:47.443 --> 03:04:49.044
TO PROFITS, BECAUSE IF A WATER

03:04:49.111 --> 03:04:50.946
UTILITY IS ABLE TO COLLECT MORE

03:04:51.013 --> 03:04:52.781
THAN ITS AUTHORIZED PROFITS,

03:04:52.848 --> 03:04:54.983
WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED IS WHAT

03:04:55.050 --> 03:04:56.685
WILL HAPPEN. YOU WILL PAD THE

03:04:56.752 --> 03:04:57.820
POCKETS OF A WATER UTILITY AT

03:04:57.886 --> 03:05:00.355
THE EXPENSE OF THE RATEPAYERS.

03:05:00.422 --> 03:05:01.790
NO, THERE'S A KEY DIFFERENCE.

03:05:01.857 --> 03:05:03.091
AND I THIS COMES BACK TO

03:05:03.158 --> 03:05:03.959
ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON'S

03:05:04.026 --> 03:05:04.793
EXCELLENT QUESTION ABOUT THIS.

03:05:04.860 --> 03:05:06.995
THERE IS A KEY AND IMPORTANT

03:05:07.062 --> 03:05:07.596
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PROFITS AND

03:05:07.663 --> 03:05:10.499
WATER PROFITS AND REVENUES HERE.

03:05:10.566 --> 03:05:12.701
AND I'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT.

03:05:12.768 --> 03:05:13.902
SO I GUESS MY QUESTION BACK TO

03:05:13.969 --> 03:05:16.138
THE AUTHOR IS DID YOU CONSIDER

03:05:16.205 --> 03:05:18.407
THAT AMENDMENT BECAUSE IT SOUNDS

03:05:18.474 --> 03:05:20.242
LIKE WHAT THAT AMENDMENT IS

03:05:20.309 --> 03:05:21.877
GETTING AT, I'M HEARING FROM

03:05:21.944 --> 03:05:24.112
YOUR WITNESSES THAT THAT'S WHAT

03:05:24.179 --> 03:05:26.949
THE INTENT STRIKES AT. SO DID

03:05:27.015 --> 03:05:28.484
YOU CONSIDER THAT AMENDMENT? IF

03:05:28.550 --> 03:05:30.018
SO, TWO PIECES, MADAM CHAIR. ONE

03:05:30.085 --> 03:05:33.222
IS I THINK IT'S CLEAR AND IT'S

03:05:33.288 --> 03:05:33.856
BEEN DEMONSTRATED HERE. THAT'S

03:05:33.922 --> 03:05:34.523
THE INTENT. SECOND, WE'RE ALWAYS

03:05:34.590 --> 03:05:36.358
WILLING TO CONTINUE DIALOG ABOUT

03:05:36.425 --> 03:05:38.627
REFINING, YOU KNOW, DEFINITIONS

03:05:38.694 --> 03:05:39.528
CAREFULLY. BUT THERE THERE'S

03:05:39.595 --> 03:05:41.129
ANOTHER PIECE TO THIS, AND I

03:05:41.196 --> 03:05:44.333
WILL REFER TO MY EXPERT. YEAH.

03:05:44.399 --> 03:05:46.268
SO LET'S GET TO THIS PROFIT

03:05:46.335 --> 03:05:48.103
QUESTION. SO GENERAL RATE CASE.

03:05:48.170 --> 03:05:49.605
YOU KNOW THEY LOOK AT EXPENSES

03:05:49.671 --> 03:05:52.174
CAPITAL ADDITIONS AND SO FORTH.

03:05:52.241 --> 03:05:53.775
RIGHT. THE COST OF CAPITAL

03:05:53.842 --> 03:05:55.143
PROCEEDINGS WHICH ARE CONDUCTED

03:05:55.210 --> 03:05:56.411
FOR ALL THE WATER UTILITIES

03:05:56.478 --> 03:05:58.013
ACTUALLY IT'S CONDUCTED

03:05:58.080 --> 03:06:00.749
COLLECTIVELY. SO THE CHARGE FOR

03:06:00.816 --> 03:06:02.251
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES, THE

03:06:02.317 --> 03:06:03.852
CPC, DETERMINES WHAT A

03:06:03.919 --> 03:06:05.153
REASONABLE COST OF CAPITAL IS ON

03:06:05.220 --> 03:06:07.089
A THREE YEAR CYCLE FOR THEM AS

03:06:07.155 --> 03:06:10.692
WELL. AND SO THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE

03:06:10.759 --> 03:06:13.962
ALLOWED TO EARN WHETHER YOU EARN

03:06:14.029 --> 03:06:16.465
THAT OR NOT. AND IT'S WELL, IT'S

03:06:16.532 --> 03:06:17.733
WELL DOCUMENTED THAT MENTED THAT

03:06:17.799 --> 03:06:19.701
MOST WATER UTILITIES DO NOT EARN

03:06:19.768 --> 03:06:21.603
THEIR AUTHORIZED RATE OF RETURN.

03:06:21.670 --> 03:06:24.006
THE REASON THEY DON'T EARN IT IS

03:06:24.072 --> 03:06:25.774
BECAUSE INEVITABLY IN THE GRC

03:06:25.841 --> 03:06:27.943
PROCESS, EXPENSES END UP BEING

03:06:28.010 --> 03:06:30.546
HIGHER, CAPITAL COSTS FOR

03:06:30.612 --> 03:06:31.713
PROJECTS END UP BEING HIGHER,

03:06:31.780 --> 03:06:34.216
AND WE NEVER REALIZE OUR RATE OF

03:06:34.283 --> 03:06:35.484
RETURN. THAT'S THAT'S WELL

03:06:35.551 --> 03:06:37.586
KNOWN. HOWEVER, IF I TAKE ONE

03:06:37.653 --> 03:06:39.388
YEAR OUT AND SAID, YOU KNOW

03:06:39.454 --> 03:06:41.089
WHAT, I'M NOT GOING TO HIRE

03:06:41.156 --> 03:06:42.224
THESE PEOPLE. I'M NOT GOING TO

03:06:42.291 --> 03:06:43.625
DO THESE PROJECTS, AND I'M GOING

03:06:43.692 --> 03:06:46.194
TO REALIZE SOME GREAT WINDFALL.

03:06:46.261 --> 03:06:47.696
YOU CAN BET THE REGULATORS ARE

03:06:47.763 --> 03:06:49.565
GOING TO BE ON ME BY NEXT RATE

03:06:49.631 --> 03:06:51.366
CYCLE AND SAY, WHAT DID YOU DO?

03:06:51.433 --> 03:06:52.668
WE AUTHORIZED YOU THIS. GOING

03:06:52.734 --> 03:06:53.602
FORWARD, YOU'RE GOING TO GET A

03:06:53.669 --> 03:06:55.370
LOT LESS. THAT'S WHY BUSINESS

03:06:55.437 --> 03:06:57.739
DOESN'T OPERATE THAT WAY. THAT'S

03:06:57.806 --> 03:06:59.908
WHY WE DON'T OPERATE THAT WAY.

03:06:59.975 --> 03:07:01.977
SO AGAIN, I'M NOT SURE I HEARD

03:07:02.044 --> 03:07:03.745
AN ANSWER THOUGH. IF THE INTENT

03:07:03.812 --> 03:07:06.815
AS YOU WERE SAYING GETS AT THAT,

03:07:06.882 --> 03:07:09.518
THEN WHY WAS THIS AMENDMENT NOT

03:07:09.585 --> 03:07:10.786
CONSIDERED OR WHY IS IT NOT

03:07:10.852 --> 03:07:12.588
BEING CONSIDERED THE PROP? THE

03:07:12.654 --> 03:07:14.323
RATE OF RETURN IS DEALT WITH IN

03:07:14.389 --> 03:07:16.425
A SEPARATE PROCEEDING REGARDING

03:07:16.491 --> 03:07:17.726
THE COST OF CAPITAL, AND IT'S

03:07:17.793 --> 03:07:20.128
BASED ON HOW MUCH YOU INVEST

03:07:20.195 --> 03:07:23.665
DURING THE PERIOD OF TIME. IF

03:07:23.732 --> 03:07:25.467
THE GENERAL RATE CASE IS BASED

03:07:25.534 --> 03:07:26.969
ON WHAT REVENUE THEY'RE GOING TO

03:07:27.035 --> 03:07:28.804
ALLOW YOU TO, TO ACHIEVE

03:07:28.870 --> 03:07:29.838
EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO DO AND

03:07:29.905 --> 03:07:31.473
PROVIDE SERVICE. AND THE BILL

03:07:31.540 --> 03:07:33.742
AGAIN, IF YOU IF WE OVER IF THEY

03:07:33.809 --> 03:07:34.610
OVER COLLECT, THEY HAVE TO

03:07:34.676 --> 03:07:37.045
RETURN TO THE RATEPAYER. THE YOU

03:07:37.112 --> 03:07:39.247
KNOW THE UTILITY IS ONLY GOING

03:07:39.314 --> 03:07:40.616
TO GET THE RATE OF RETURN THAT

03:07:40.682 --> 03:07:44.119
WAS APPROVED DURING THE SEPARATE

03:07:44.186 --> 03:07:45.520
COST OF CAPITAL PROCEEDING, AND

03:07:45.587 --> 03:07:47.322
ONLY IF THEY'VE INVESTED AND

03:07:47.389 --> 03:07:49.257
ONLY IF THEY'VE BEEN EFFICIENT,

03:07:49.324 --> 03:07:54.296
IF, IF THEY, IF THEY. OVER IF,

03:07:54.363 --> 03:07:56.465
IF THEY, AS MY COLLEAGUE

03:07:56.531 --> 03:07:58.166
SUGGESTED, IF THEY DON'T DO ALL

03:07:58.233 --> 03:07:59.868
THE THINGS THAT THE PUC DIRECTED

03:07:59.935 --> 03:08:01.837
THEM TO DO, ALL THE INVESTMENTS

03:08:01.903 --> 03:08:03.672
AND WHATNOT, THEN IN THE NEXT

03:08:03.739 --> 03:08:05.841
GENERAL RATE CASE, IT COMES OUT

03:08:05.907 --> 03:08:06.742
OF THEIR BACK POCKET. THEN

03:08:06.808 --> 03:08:09.277
THAT'S HOW THE PUC EQUALIZES

03:08:09.344 --> 03:08:14.750
THAT. IF THE UTILITY COLLECTS

03:08:14.816 --> 03:08:16.818
MORE MONEY THAN WHAT WAS

03:08:16.885 --> 03:08:19.154
FORECASTED. FOR EXAMPLE, IF I AM

03:08:19.221 --> 03:08:21.757
A GROCERY STORE AND I FORECAST

03:08:21.823 --> 03:08:23.191
THAT MY CUSTOMERS ARE GOING TO

03:08:23.258 --> 03:08:25.927
USE 100 GALLONS OF MILK, BUT

03:08:25.994 --> 03:08:28.096
THEY ONLY BUY 80 GALLONS OF MILK

03:08:28.163 --> 03:08:29.865
UNDER THIS PROGRAM, I WOULD GET

03:08:29.931 --> 03:08:31.733
TO CHARGE THEM FOR THE 20 EXTRA

03:08:31.800 --> 03:08:33.268
THAT THEY DID NOT USE, THAT THEY

03:08:33.335 --> 03:08:34.636
DID NOT COME IN WITH THE

03:08:34.703 --> 03:08:36.938
INTENTION OF BUYING. SO I I'M A

03:08:37.005 --> 03:08:37.839
LITTLE BIT CONFUSED. BUT IF A

03:08:37.906 --> 03:08:40.108
WATER IF A WATER UTILITY

03:08:40.175 --> 03:08:41.810
COLLECTS MORE WATER THAN WHAT

03:08:41.877 --> 03:08:44.346
WAS USED UNDER RAM, THEY DO NOT

03:08:44.413 --> 03:08:46.581
RETURN IT, THEY KEEP IT. AND

03:08:46.648 --> 03:08:48.884
THAT WAS WHAT WAS DONE UNDER

03:08:48.950 --> 03:08:51.353
RAM. WE HAVE TEN YEARS OF DATA

03:08:51.420 --> 03:08:53.021
INDICATING THAT THIS IS THE

03:08:53.088 --> 03:08:56.558
CASE. TO THAT ANALOGY, THE

03:08:56.625 --> 03:09:00.429
ALTERNATIVE IS THAT YES, WE THE

03:09:00.495 --> 03:09:02.964
UTILITY CHARGES WHAT THE PUC

03:09:03.031 --> 03:09:05.600
APPROVES IN, IN THE IN IN THE

03:09:05.667 --> 03:09:08.070
REVENUE. IF, IF THEY DIDN'T IF,

03:09:08.136 --> 03:09:10.639
IF THEY DIDN'T DO WHAT SHE JUST

03:09:10.706 --> 03:09:11.773
DESCRIBED, WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE

03:09:11.840 --> 03:09:13.608
TO MAKE IT UP BY HAVING A LARGER

03:09:13.675 --> 03:09:14.910
FIXED CHARGE. THAT'S THAT'S THE

03:09:14.976 --> 03:09:17.779
TRADE OFF. DO YOU WANT A LARGER

03:09:17.846 --> 03:09:19.214
FIXED CHARGE OR DO YOU, DO YOU

03:09:19.281 --> 03:09:19.948
HAVE A DECOUPLED SYSTEM THAT

03:09:20.015 --> 03:09:22.350
ALLOWS YOU TO DO WHAT WE'VE

03:09:22.417 --> 03:09:23.251
DESCRIBED HERE TODAY. AND THAT'S

03:09:23.318 --> 03:09:30.525
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE IS. TO

03:09:30.592 --> 03:09:31.526
BASICALLY OFFSET THE SCENARIO

03:09:31.593 --> 03:09:32.928
THAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED. YOU'D

03:09:32.994 --> 03:09:34.730
HAVE TO HAVE A LARGER FIXED

03:09:34.796 --> 03:09:35.797
CHARGE. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

03:09:35.864 --> 03:09:37.532
TRYING TO AVOID BECAUSE A LARGER

03:09:37.599 --> 03:09:38.734
FIXED CHARGE DISPROPORTIONATELY

03:09:38.800 --> 03:09:45.841
HITS LOWER INCOME RATEPAYERS.

03:09:45.907 --> 03:09:47.576
OKAY. WE'LL WE'LL TAKE ONE MORE

03:09:47.642 --> 03:09:48.677
RESPONSE. AND THEN I THINK WE'RE

03:09:48.744 --> 03:09:50.645
PROBABLY GOING TO JUST TO WE'RE

03:09:50.712 --> 03:09:53.181
GOING TO JUST YES. WE'RE NOT

03:09:53.248 --> 03:09:54.049
GOING TO AGREE ON THE FACTS OF

03:09:54.116 --> 03:09:55.550
THIS BILL. THAT IS ONE THING

03:09:55.617 --> 03:09:57.018
THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS. YOUR

03:09:57.085 --> 03:09:59.454
QUESTION. THE LAST ISSUE, THE

03:09:59.521 --> 03:10:00.822
TWO TIMES THAT THE COMMISSION IN

03:10:00.889 --> 03:10:02.457
RULEMAKINGS NEEDED TO ADDRESS

03:10:02.524 --> 03:10:04.993
THE LARGE RAM BALANCES THAT HAD

03:10:05.060 --> 03:10:06.328
ACCUMULATED DURING THE PILOT

03:10:06.394 --> 03:10:08.730
PROJECT FOR WHICH CALIFORNIANS

03:10:08.797 --> 03:10:11.099
WERE UP IN ARMS. I CAN'T THINK

03:10:11.166 --> 03:10:12.601
OF ONE RATEPAYER THAT WAS

03:10:12.667 --> 03:10:15.170
SUPPORTIVE OF THE RAM, BUT THE

03:10:15.237 --> 03:10:16.438
TWO TIMES THAT THE COMMISSION

03:10:16.505 --> 03:10:19.307
HAD TO ADDRESS IT IN TERMS OF

03:10:19.374 --> 03:10:22.611
THE COLLECTIONS OR THE FIXED

03:10:22.677 --> 03:10:25.113
CHARGES, IT WAS JUST THE

03:10:25.180 --> 03:10:28.016
OPPOSITE RESULT THAT THE

03:10:28.083 --> 03:10:30.318
COMMISSION DETERMINED WAS

03:10:30.385 --> 03:10:31.820
NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THE LARGE

03:10:31.887 --> 03:10:34.923
RAM CHARGE. IT ACTUALLY REQUIRED

03:10:34.990 --> 03:10:37.959
THE UTILITIES TO IMPLEMENT

03:10:38.026 --> 03:10:41.129
LARGER FIXED CHARGES BECAUSE THE

03:10:41.196 --> 03:10:45.367
RAM BALANCES HAD GROWN SO LARGE

03:10:45.433 --> 03:10:47.435
THAT THE UTILITIES COULD NOT

03:10:47.502 --> 03:10:50.038
COLLECT THEM FAST ENOUGH TO BE

03:10:50.105 --> 03:10:52.007
IN COMPLIANCE WITH COMMISSION

03:10:52.073 --> 03:10:55.710
RULES AND THEIR OWN GAAP

03:10:55.777 --> 03:10:57.579
ACCOUNTING. THAT'S HOW BAD IT

03:10:57.646 --> 03:11:02.884
GOT. ALL RIGHT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

03:11:02.951 --> 03:11:04.519
GONZALEZ, THANK YOU. A FAIRLY

03:11:04.586 --> 03:11:05.720
QUICK ONE. JUST BRINGING IT BACK

03:11:05.787 --> 03:11:07.055
TO WHERE WE STARTED. I'VE SAID

03:11:07.122 --> 03:11:09.191
THIS ON THIS DÍAS BEFORE, AND I

03:11:09.257 --> 03:11:09.758
REPRESENT THE FIFTH POOREST

03:11:09.825 --> 03:11:11.159
DISTRICT IN THE STATE. CUSTOMERS

03:11:11.226 --> 03:11:12.828
DON'T PAY RATES, THEY PAY BILLS.

03:11:12.894 --> 03:11:15.297
SO I WANT TO KIND OF BRING IT

03:11:15.363 --> 03:11:16.631
DOWN TO THAT LEVEL. AND WHEN WE

03:11:16.698 --> 03:11:17.966
HAVE THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT

03:11:18.033 --> 03:11:18.767
AFFORDABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY

03:11:18.834 --> 03:11:21.303
AND DRIVING POLICIES THAT SHOULD

03:11:21.369 --> 03:11:23.438
EMPOWER AND NOT HINDER LOWER

03:11:23.505 --> 03:11:25.640
INCOME COMMUNITIES, WHY WOULDN'T

03:11:25.707 --> 03:11:27.042
WE GIVE WATER UTILITIES THE

03:11:27.108 --> 03:11:28.910
TOOLS THAT THEY NEED TO LOWER

03:11:28.977 --> 03:11:32.080
THOSE COSTS? FOR LOW INCOME

03:11:32.147 --> 03:11:33.181
HOUSEHOLDS WHO ARE DOING THEIR

03:11:33.248 --> 03:11:36.585
PART TO CONSERVE? SO ONCE AGAIN,

03:11:36.651 --> 03:11:39.688
IN TERMS OF GOING FORWARD AND

03:11:39.754 --> 03:11:41.556
SPECULATING AND TOOLS NEED, WE

03:11:41.623 --> 03:11:43.558
ONLY NEED TO LOOK BACK. WE DON'T

03:11:43.625 --> 03:11:45.861
NEED TO SPECULATE. SO FOR 15

03:11:45.927 --> 03:11:48.029
YEARS I WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, I

03:11:48.096 --> 03:11:50.265
THINK IT DOES A DISSERVICE TO

03:11:50.332 --> 03:11:51.566
THE GREAT OTHER FOUR CLASS Ã

03:11:51.633 --> 03:11:54.236
WATER UTILITIES THAT HAD ROBUST

03:11:54.302 --> 03:11:56.805
LOW INCOME PROGRAMS IN THE STATE

03:11:56.872 --> 03:11:59.341
DURING THESE 15 YEARS, THAT HAD

03:11:59.407 --> 03:12:01.276
TIERED RATES, THAT DID NOT HAVE

03:12:01.343 --> 03:12:02.510
ANY OF THE SPECULATIVE PROBLEMS

03:12:02.577 --> 03:12:04.446
THAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY. WE DON'T

03:12:04.512 --> 03:12:07.649
NEED TO SPECULATE. WE HAVE 15

03:12:07.716 --> 03:12:10.118
YEARS OF UTILITIES NOT HAVING

03:12:10.185 --> 03:12:11.887
THIS. THAT WAS THE WHOLE PURPOSE

03:12:11.953 --> 03:12:13.455
OF THE PILOT PROJECT. SO WITH

03:12:13.521 --> 03:12:14.890
ALL DUE RESPECT, I WOULD SAY

03:12:14.956 --> 03:12:16.658
THAT THE FOUR UTILITIES THAT

03:12:16.725 --> 03:12:18.760
OPERATE WITHOUT THIS MECHANISM

03:12:18.827 --> 03:12:20.662
ACTUALLY DID QUITE WELL. AT THE

03:12:20.729 --> 03:12:22.697
SAME TIME, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

03:12:22.764 --> 03:12:24.599
MEETING, ALL OF THE VERY

03:12:24.666 --> 03:12:26.334
LEGITIMATE CONCERNS THAT YOU

03:12:26.401 --> 03:12:28.937
MENTIONED TODAY IN TERMS OF

03:12:29.004 --> 03:12:30.238
AFFORDABILITY, EQUITY, LOW

03:12:30.305 --> 03:12:32.574
INCOME PROGRAMS, THEY WERE

03:12:32.641 --> 03:12:34.609
SUCCESSFULLY MET. I JUST I WOULD

03:12:34.676 --> 03:12:36.378
JUST LOOK, SENATOR. YES, THANK

03:12:36.444 --> 03:12:38.213
YOU, MADAM CHAIR. WE CAN'T ARGUE

03:12:38.280 --> 03:12:41.483
THE PILOT AS THE STANDARD BASIS

03:12:41.549 --> 03:12:43.285
FOR THE CONVERSATION AND THEN

03:12:43.351 --> 03:12:44.419
CONVENIENTLY PICK AND CHOOSE

03:12:44.486 --> 03:12:47.022
WHAT ELEMENTS OF THE. NET DATA

03:12:47.088 --> 03:12:48.857
WE WANT TO ACCEPT OR REJECT. AND

03:12:48.924 --> 03:12:51.426
THAT BRINGS IT BACK TO THE FOCUS

03:12:51.493 --> 03:12:54.129
OF THE BILL. THERE IS CREDIBLE

03:12:54.195 --> 03:12:56.264
PEER REVIEWED DATA THAT SHOWS

03:12:56.331 --> 03:12:58.867
THE POTENTIAL OF THIS CONSTRUCT

03:12:58.934 --> 03:13:00.735
TO BOTH ENCOURAGE CONSERVATION

03:13:00.802 --> 03:13:02.404
AND REDUCE COSTS OVER TIME. I

03:13:02.470 --> 03:13:04.105
DON'T WANT TO GET THAT CONFLATED

03:13:04.172 --> 03:13:06.007
WITH THE ALREADY OVERLY

03:13:06.074 --> 03:13:07.542
CUMBERSOME AND INTENTIONALLY

03:13:07.609 --> 03:13:08.944
COMPLEX PROCESS. WE'VE EVOLVED

03:13:09.010 --> 03:13:10.345
IN THIS STATE AROUND HOW

03:13:10.412 --> 03:13:12.213
UTILITIES RECOVER COSTS AND

03:13:12.280 --> 03:13:13.515
INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE. IF WE

03:13:13.581 --> 03:13:14.983
HAD TO REDESIGN IT TODAY, MADAM

03:13:15.050 --> 03:13:16.751

WORK YOU'VE DONE IN THIS SPACE,

03:13:18.787 --> 03:13:20.789
WE WOULD NOT DESIGN IT THIS WAY.

03:13:20.855 --> 03:13:22.524
THAT SAID, I JUST I WANT TO MAKE

03:13:22.590 --> 03:13:24.426
SURE WE DON'T LOSE TRACK. ALL

03:13:24.492 --> 03:13:25.260

03:13:25.327 --> 03:13:28.029
OF THE BILL AND THE DATA THAT IS

GREAT DISCUSSION. THANK YOU,

03:15:41.896 --> 03:15:43.498
MADAM CHAIR. AND MEMBERS, I'M

03:15:43.565 --> 03:15:46.835
PLEASED TO PRESENT SB 643, WHICH

03:15:46.901 --> 03:15:48.770
DIRECTS THE CALIFORNIA AIR

03:15:48.837 --> 03:15:50.672
RESOURCES BOARD, TO ADMINISTER A

03:15:50.738 --> 03:15:52.006
COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM FOR

03:15:52.073 --> 03:15:54.809
CARBON DIOXIDE DIOXIDE REMOVAL

03:15:54.876 --> 03:15:56.344
PROJECTS. AS YOU KNOW, CLIMATE

03:15:56.411 --> 03:15:58.813
CHANGE POSES A SEVERE THREAT TO

03:15:58.880 --> 03:16:00.582
CALIFORNIA. WE'VE ALL SEEN IT.

03:16:00.648 --> 03:16:03.585
CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL REFERS TO

03:16:03.651 --> 03:16:05.386
REMOVING CARBON DIOXIDE FROM THE

03:16:05.453 --> 03:16:06.721
ATMOSPHERE AND PERMANENTLY

03:16:06.788 --> 03:16:09.491
STORING IT IN A SAFE AND SECURE

03:16:09.557 --> 03:16:11.392
LOCATION, SUCH AS UNDERGROUND

03:16:11.459 --> 03:16:12.861
GEOLOGIC FORMATIONS OR IN

03:16:12.927 --> 03:16:14.629
CEMENT. IT'S NOT THE SAME THING

03:16:14.696 --> 03:16:16.798
AS CARBON CAPTURE, WHICH

03:16:16.865 --> 03:16:18.700
CAPTURED CO2 FROM THE

03:16:18.766 --> 03:16:20.068
SMOKESTACKS OF EXISTING

03:16:20.135 --> 03:16:21.836
INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES THAT BURN

03:16:21.903 --> 03:16:23.738
FOSSIL FUELS. AS YOU ARE AWARE,

03:16:23.805 --> 03:16:25.406
THE STATE'S GOAL IS TO ACHIEVE

03:16:25.473 --> 03:16:27.542
NET ZERO GREENHOUSE GAS

03:16:27.609 --> 03:16:30.545
EMISSIONS NO LATER, NO LATER

03:16:30.612 --> 03:16:35.150
THAN 2045. CARB'S 2022 SCOPING

03:16:35.216 --> 03:16:38.319
PLAN FOR ACHIEVING CARBON CARBON

03:16:38.386 --> 03:16:39.521
NEUTRALITY STATED THAT THERE IS

03:16:39.587 --> 03:16:42.023
NO PATH TO CARBON NEUTRALITY

03:16:42.090 --> 03:16:43.358
WITHOUT CARBON REMOVAL AND

03:16:43.424 --> 03:16:45.293
SEQUESTRATION SEQUESTRATION, AND

03:16:45.360 --> 03:16:47.929
THEY ESTABLISHED TARGETS OF 7

03:16:47.996 --> 03:16:49.831
MILLION METRIC TONS ANNUALLY BY

03:16:49.898 --> 03:16:52.500
2030, WHICH IS A SHORT FIVE

03:16:52.567 --> 03:16:55.303
YEARS AWAY AND 75 MILLION METRIC

03:16:55.370 --> 03:16:58.273
TONS BY 2045. OVER THE LAST

03:16:58.339 --> 03:16:59.607
SEVERAL YEARS, A NUMBER OF

03:16:59.674 --> 03:17:01.543
COMPANIES HAVE VOLUNTARILY

03:17:01.609 --> 03:17:03.678
PURCHASED CDR REMOVALS AS PART

03:17:03.745 --> 03:17:05.446
OF THEIR CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS

03:17:05.513 --> 03:17:06.948
AND TO DATE, WITH THE EXCEPTION

03:17:07.015 --> 03:17:10.018
OF A PILOT FACILITY IN TRACY,

03:17:10.084 --> 03:17:11.819
NONE OF THE CDR REMOVALS HAVE

03:17:11.886 --> 03:17:13.354
OCCURRED IN CALIFORNIA.

03:17:13.421 --> 03:17:15.089
BASICALLY, WE MAKE IT HARDER FOR

03:17:15.156 --> 03:17:18.726
US TO CONSTRUCT PROJECTS HERE IN

03:17:18.793 --> 03:17:21.563
CALIFORNIA, SO THEY TAKE OUR

03:17:21.629 --> 03:17:23.731
RESOURCES AND ALL OF THE

03:17:23.798 --> 03:17:26.668
TECHNOLOGY AND THE BRAINPOWER

03:17:26.734 --> 03:17:28.536
THAT COMES OUT OF OUR

03:17:28.603 --> 03:17:30.004
UNIVERSITIES, AND THEY MOVE TO

03:17:30.071 --> 03:17:31.439
ANOTHER STATE AND DO IT THERE.

03:17:31.506 --> 03:17:33.608
WE HAVE NOT DEVELOPED SUFFICIENT

03:17:33.675 --> 03:17:35.610
PATHWAYS TO ACHIEVE THE CDR

03:17:35.677 --> 03:17:37.545
TARGETS, AND THE CLOCK IS

03:17:37.612 --> 03:17:40.748
TICKING TO MEET THE URGENT NEED

03:17:40.815 --> 03:17:42.050
TO READ TO REACH NEUTRALITY.

03:17:42.116 --> 03:17:44.619
THIS BILL ESTABLISHES THE CARBON

03:17:44.686 --> 03:17:46.454
DIOXIDE REMOVAL PURCHASE PILOT

03:17:46.521 --> 03:17:48.489
PROJECT UNDER CARB AND DIRECTS

03:17:48.556 --> 03:17:50.959
THEM TO PROVIDE UP TO $50

03:17:51.025 --> 03:17:53.828
MILLION IN COMPETITIVE GRANTS

03:17:53.895 --> 03:17:56.331
FOR THESE PROJECTS. THEY INCLUDE

03:17:56.397 --> 03:17:58.433
FOUR TYPES OF PROJECTS. AND THEN

03:17:58.499 --> 03:17:59.801
WHEN SELECTING THE PROJECTS,

03:17:59.867 --> 03:18:01.302
CARB MUST PRIORITIZE THE

03:18:01.369 --> 03:18:04.005
POTENTIAL TO ACCELERATE THE

03:18:04.072 --> 03:18:06.608
STRATEGIES. MAKE SURE THE

03:18:06.674 --> 03:18:08.910
DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS IS ACROSS

03:18:08.977 --> 03:18:10.478
MULTIPLE GEOGRAPHIES AND PROJECT

03:18:10.545 --> 03:18:12.714
TYPES, AND THE STRENGTH OF THE

03:18:12.780 --> 03:18:14.816
COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLANS WITH ME

03:18:14.882 --> 03:18:17.085
HERE TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT

03:18:17.151 --> 03:18:21.122
OF THE BILL IS DIANE Dð WITH

03:18:21.189 --> 03:18:24.292
PROJECT 2030 AND DOCTOR PETER

03:18:24.359 --> 03:18:27.195
MINER WITH ABSOLUTE CLIMATE.

03:18:27.262 --> 03:18:29.264
GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS DIANE

03:18:29.330 --> 03:18:30.632
DOUCETTE, AND I'M ONE OF THE

03:18:30.698 --> 03:18:32.267
CO-FOUNDERS OF PROJECT 2030. AND

03:18:32.333 --> 03:18:34.702
WE'RE THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL.

03:18:34.769 --> 03:18:37.205
PROJECT 2030 IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL

03:18:37.272 --> 03:18:39.807
NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION. WE ARE A

03:18:39.874 --> 03:18:41.943
TEAM OF ALUMNI, CLIMATE

03:18:42.010 --> 03:18:42.977
ADVOCATES. WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON

03:18:43.044 --> 03:18:44.746
CLIMATE POLICIES SINCE WE WERE

03:18:44.812 --> 03:18:47.315
YOUNG ADVOCATES SPONSORING AB32,

03:18:47.382 --> 03:18:48.750
THE GLOBAL WARMING SOLUTION ACT

03:18:48.816 --> 03:18:51.953
OF 2006. WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS

03:18:52.020 --> 03:18:53.288
FOR A LONG TIME. YOU JUST HEARD

03:18:53.354 --> 03:18:54.856
ABOUT THE CDR TARGETS THAT CARB

03:18:54.922 --> 03:18:56.791
INCLUDED IN THE SCOPING PLAN. WE

03:18:56.858 --> 03:18:58.726
NEED 7 MILLION METRIC TONS OF

03:18:58.793 --> 03:19:01.796
CDR ANNUALLY BY 2030, AND 75

03:19:01.863 --> 03:19:04.932
MILLION METRIC TONS ANNUALLY BY

03:19:04.999 --> 03:19:07.368
2045. AND WE ARE NOT ON A PATH

03:19:07.435 --> 03:19:10.305
TO ACHIEVE THESE TARGETS. SB 643

03:19:10.371 --> 03:19:12.206
IS A CRITICAL STEP IN REACHING

03:19:12.273 --> 03:19:14.776
THESE GOALS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO

03:19:14.842 --> 03:19:16.144
NOTE THAT THERE HAS BEEN

03:19:16.210 --> 03:19:18.946
EXTENSIVE R&amp;D INTO CDR

03:19:19.013 --> 03:19:21.015
TECHNOLOGIES GLOBALLY,

03:19:21.082 --> 03:19:22.150
NATIONALLY AND RIGHT HERE IN

03:19:22.216 --> 03:19:23.685
CALIFORNIA BY OUR NATIONAL LABS,

03:19:23.751 --> 03:19:26.120
OUR UNIVERSITIES AND OUR

03:19:26.187 --> 03:19:27.889
ENTREPRENEURS. GLOBALLY, MANY

03:19:27.955 --> 03:19:30.458
CDR TECHNOLOGIES HAVE ALREADY

03:19:30.525 --> 03:19:32.293
TRANSITIONED FROM THE R&amp;D STAGE

03:19:32.360 --> 03:19:34.162
TO THE DEMONSTRATION AND

03:19:34.228 --> 03:19:37.265
DEPLOYMENT STAGE. SB 643 IS

03:19:37.332 --> 03:19:38.633
FOCUSED ON THOSE TECHNOLOGIES

03:19:38.700 --> 03:19:40.568
THAT HAVE ALREADY UNDERGONE

03:19:40.635 --> 03:19:43.538
EXTENSIVE R&amp;D THAT ARE READY FOR

03:19:43.604 --> 03:19:45.206
DEMONSTRATION AND DEPLOYMENT,

03:19:45.273 --> 03:19:46.607
AND HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO SCALE

03:19:46.674 --> 03:19:49.911
IN CALIFORNIA, AS WE JUST HEARD,

03:19:49.977 --> 03:19:51.012
UNFORTUNATELY, MANY OF OUR

03:19:51.079 --> 03:19:53.147
HOMEGROWN TECHNOLOGIES ARE GOING

03:19:53.214 --> 03:19:54.682
TO OTHER STATES BECAUSE OF

03:19:54.749 --> 03:19:57.318
BETTER INCENTIVES. IT'S ALSO

03:19:57.385 --> 03:19:59.320
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT OVER THE

03:19:59.387 --> 03:20:01.389
LAST FIVE YEARS, A GLOBAL,

03:20:01.456 --> 03:20:03.725
VOLUNTARY, MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR

03:20:03.791 --> 03:20:06.127
CDR MARKET HAS DEVELOPED WITH

03:20:06.194 --> 03:20:07.695
CDR PURCHASES FROM COMPANIES

03:20:07.762 --> 03:20:10.531
LIKE MICROSOFT, JP MORGAN,

03:20:10.598 --> 03:20:12.500
GOOGLE AND A HANDFUL OF OTHERS.

03:20:12.567 --> 03:20:14.936
THEY HAVE NO REASON RIGHT NOW TO

03:20:15.002 --> 03:20:16.537
PRIORITIZE CALIFORNIA PROJECTS,

03:20:16.604 --> 03:20:18.306
AND THEY AREN'T. WE WANT TO

03:20:18.373 --> 03:20:21.509
CHANGE THAT. SB 643 GIVES

03:20:21.576 --> 03:20:23.344
CALIFORNIA THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO

03:20:23.411 --> 03:20:25.580
MANY THINGS TO JUMPSTART OUR

03:20:25.646 --> 03:20:27.749
EFFORTS TO MEET OUR CDR GOALS,

03:20:27.815 --> 03:20:29.484
TO SET THE HIGHEST QUALITY

03:20:29.550 --> 03:20:32.420
STANDARDS FOR CDR, TO CREATE A

03:20:32.487 --> 03:20:34.489
MODEL FOR COMMUNITY PROTECTIONS,

03:20:34.555 --> 03:20:35.857
AND TO ATTRACT INVESTMENT

03:20:35.923 --> 03:20:37.925
CAPITAL TO CREATE THE PROJECTS

03:20:37.992 --> 03:20:39.994
AND THE JOBS HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

03:20:40.061 --> 03:20:42.630
I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE

03:20:42.697 --> 03:20:45.533
TODAY. THANK YOU. HI EVERYONE.

03:20:45.600 --> 03:20:46.601
THANK YOU, COMMITTEE MEMBERS,

03:20:46.667 --> 03:20:48.403
FOR HAVING ME HERE. MY NAME IS

03:20:48.469 --> 03:20:50.204
PETER MINER. I'M THE FOUNDER OF

03:20:50.271 --> 03:20:51.038
ABSOLUTE CLIMATES. I'VE BEEN

03:20:51.105 --> 03:20:52.206
WORKING IN THE CARBON REMOVAL

03:20:52.273 --> 03:20:53.708
INDUSTRY FOR ABOUT SEVEN YEARS,

03:20:53.775 --> 03:20:56.077
MOST OF THAT AT AN ORGANIZATION

03:20:56.144 --> 03:20:57.011
CALLED CARBON 180, WHICH IS A US

03:20:57.078 --> 03:20:58.446
FEDERAL POLICY ORGANIZATION

03:20:58.513 --> 03:20:59.814
FOCUSED ON CARBON REMOVAL. I WAS

03:20:59.881 --> 03:21:00.882
THE DIRECTOR OF SCIENCE AND

03:21:00.948 --> 03:21:03.017
INNOVATION THERE. SO MY JOB WAS

03:21:03.084 --> 03:21:03.651
TO BE THE TECHNICAL EXPERT TO

03:21:03.718 --> 03:21:05.586
UNDERSTAND THE SAFETY AND

03:21:05.653 --> 03:21:06.220
EFFICACY OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES.

03:21:06.287 --> 03:21:08.523
IN THAT TIME, I SAW THE CARBON

03:21:08.589 --> 03:21:09.123
REMOVAL INDUSTRY CHANGE AND

03:21:09.190 --> 03:21:11.025
DEVELOP SIGNIFICANTLY. IT WENT

03:21:11.092 --> 03:21:13.094
FROM LAB EXPERIMENTS TO REAL

03:21:13.161 --> 03:21:15.296
PROJECTS WITH MEASURABLE CARBON

03:21:15.363 --> 03:21:16.998
DIOXIDE IMPACTS AT THE SCALE OF

03:21:17.064 --> 03:21:18.599
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF TONS PER

03:21:18.666 --> 03:21:19.934
YEAR. THAT'S OBVIOUSLY VERY

03:21:20.001 --> 03:21:22.036
SMALL IN COMPARISON TO THE TENS

03:21:22.103 --> 03:21:24.105
OF MILLIONS THIS STATE ALONE IS

03:21:24.172 --> 03:21:25.673
GOING TO NEED OVER THE NEXT

03:21:25.740 --> 03:21:27.175
COUPLE DECADES. BUT THIS IS

03:21:27.241 --> 03:21:29.343
PRECISELY WHY SB 643 IS SO

03:21:29.410 --> 03:21:30.778
IMPORTANT. THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH

03:21:30.845 --> 03:21:32.647
LEARNING THAT CAN BE DONE IN A

03:21:32.713 --> 03:21:33.815
LABORATORY. WE'RE AT THE POINT

03:21:33.881 --> 03:21:35.817
WHERE WE NEED ACTUAL DATA FROM

03:21:35.883 --> 03:21:37.585
PROJECTS TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO

03:21:37.652 --> 03:21:39.454
MAKE THIS STUFF CHEAPER, HOW TO

03:21:39.520 --> 03:21:40.822
MAKE IT MORE SCALABLE. AND SB

03:21:40.888 --> 03:21:42.223
643 IS CALIFORNIA PUTTING ITS

03:21:42.290 --> 03:21:44.492
MONEY WHERE ITS MOUTH IS AND

03:21:44.559 --> 03:21:45.126
SAYING, YES, THIS IS IMPORTANT

03:21:45.193 --> 03:21:46.494
FOR OUR FUTURE, AND WE'RE GOING

03:21:46.561 --> 03:21:49.163
TO START INVESTING IN IT TODAY

03:21:49.230 --> 03:21:50.031
AND GET THE PRIVATE INDUSTRY TO

03:21:50.097 --> 03:21:51.232
FOLLOW SUIT. THE INFORMATION

03:21:51.299 --> 03:21:52.667
THAT WE NEED TO SHOW THAT CARBON

03:21:52.733 --> 03:21:54.035
REMOVAL IS SAFE AND READY IS

03:21:54.101 --> 03:21:54.669
ALREADY HERE. WE ALREADY KNOW

03:21:54.735 --> 03:21:56.571
THAT IT CAN MAKE AN IMPACT

03:21:56.637 --> 03:21:57.905
BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN IT IN ACTION.

03:21:57.972 --> 03:21:59.740
AS WAS ALREADY MENTIONED, ONE OF

03:21:59.807 --> 03:22:01.108
THE FIRST DIRECT AIR CAPTURE

03:22:01.175 --> 03:22:01.876
FACILITY IN THE UNITED STATES

03:22:01.943 --> 03:22:03.144
WAS BUILT IN TRACY, CALIFORNIA

03:22:03.211 --> 03:22:04.779
AND CONTINUES TO OPERATE TO THIS

03:22:04.846 --> 03:22:06.013
DAY. MANY OF THE FIRST MARINE

03:22:06.080 --> 03:22:07.815
CDR EXPERIMENTS ARE BEING DONE

03:22:07.882 --> 03:22:09.784
ON OFF THE COAST OF SOUTHERN

03:22:09.851 --> 03:22:10.751
CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS FARMLANDS

03:22:10.818 --> 03:22:12.119
ACROSS THE US. ENHANCED ROCK

03:22:12.186 --> 03:22:13.988
WEATHERING IS BEING DONE AS A

03:22:14.055 --> 03:22:15.723
SUBSTITUTE FOR LIME TO MAKE IT A

03:22:15.790 --> 03:22:16.724
LOWER EMISSIONS PROCESS FOR

03:22:16.791 --> 03:22:17.758
GROWING CROPS, BUT ALSO TAKING

03:22:17.825 --> 03:22:19.360
CARBON DIOXIDE ATMOSPHERE. WE

03:22:19.427 --> 03:22:21.195
KNOW THIS WORKS. IT'S JUST THE

03:22:21.262 --> 03:22:22.597
QUESTION OF HOW DO WE MAKE IT

03:22:22.663 --> 03:22:23.831
WORK AT SCALE? AND THAT'S WHERE

03:22:23.898 --> 03:22:25.466
I THINK CALIFORNIA CAN HAVE A

03:22:25.533 --> 03:22:26.934
BIG IMPACT, BECAUSE I THINK

03:22:27.001 --> 03:22:27.735
ULTIMATELY EVERYONE WANTS THIS

03:22:27.802 --> 03:22:29.837
TECHNOLOGY TO BE USED IN A WAY

03:22:29.904 --> 03:22:31.372
THAT IS REDUCING HARM AND IS

03:22:31.439 --> 03:22:33.774
BEING DONE IN A WAY THAT'S SAFE,

03:22:33.841 --> 03:22:34.208
BUT THAT NEEDS TO BE

03:22:34.275 --> 03:22:35.610
DEMONSTRATED. AND SO CALIFORNIA,

03:22:35.676 --> 03:22:36.844
THROUGH SB 6043 HAS THE

03:22:36.911 --> 03:22:38.279
OPPORTUNITY TO BE THE LEADERS OF

03:22:38.346 --> 03:22:39.914

03:22:41.415 --> 03:22:42.650
SAFETY LOOKS LIKE WHEN

03:22:42.717 --> 03:22:43.251
CALIFORNIA DOES SOMETHING ON

03:22:43.317 --> 03:22:46.153
CLIMATE, THE REST OF THE WORLD

03:22:46.220 --> 03:22:47.355
LISTENS. SO LET'S SHOW THEM.

BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY, AND WE ARE

03:24:19.981 --> 03:24:21.983
JOINED BY 12 GROUPS. STRONGLY

03:24:22.049 --> 03:24:24.518
OPPOSE SB 643, WHICH MANDATES

03:24:24.585 --> 03:24:26.754
HARMFUL AND UNVERIFIED FORMS OF

03:24:26.821 --> 03:24:27.722
ENGINEERED CARBON DIOXIDE

03:24:27.788 --> 03:24:30.157
REMOVAL, OR CDR, SUCH AS BIOMASS

03:24:30.224 --> 03:24:31.859
ENERGY WITH CARBON CAPTURE AND

03:24:31.926 --> 03:24:33.227
STORAGE, AND MARINE

03:24:33.294 --> 03:24:34.395
GEOENGINEERING. THIS BILL

03:24:34.462 --> 03:24:36.831
COMMITS 50 MILLION OF TAXPAYER

03:24:36.897 --> 03:24:39.000
DOLLARS IN ONGOING SPENDING OF

03:24:39.066 --> 03:24:40.835
2.4 MILLION PER YEAR TO DEPLOY

03:24:40.901 --> 03:24:42.536
UNVERIFIED, EXPENSIVE CDR

03:24:42.603 --> 03:24:44.538
PROJECTS AT A TIME OF BUDGET

03:24:44.605 --> 03:24:46.874
CRISIS, AND WE HAVE SEVERAL KEY

03:24:46.941 --> 03:24:48.976
CONCERNS. FIRST, THIS IS A CDR

03:24:49.043 --> 03:24:50.344
DEPLOYMENT BILL, BUT IT SHOULD

03:24:50.411 --> 03:24:52.580
BE AN R&amp;D BILL. STATE AGENCIES

03:24:52.647 --> 03:24:54.482
SHOULD FIRST RESEARCH AND

03:24:54.548 --> 03:24:55.816
DETERMINE THE VERIFIED,

03:24:55.883 --> 03:24:57.885
EFFECTIVE FORMS OF CDR AND MAP

03:24:57.952 --> 03:24:59.887
OUT THEIR RISKS AND COSTS TO

03:24:59.954 --> 03:25:02.089
STATE TO TAXPAYERS BEFORE

03:25:02.156 --> 03:25:04.825
MANDATING THEM. SECOND, THE BILL

03:25:04.892 --> 03:25:06.427
GREENLIGHTS BIKERS OR BIOMASS

03:25:06.494 --> 03:25:08.396
CARBON REMOVAL AND STORAGE.

03:25:08.462 --> 03:25:10.498
ALMOST ALL BIKERS PROJECTS ARE

03:25:10.564 --> 03:25:12.099
BECCS PROJECTS THAT INVOLVE

03:25:12.166 --> 03:25:13.501
BIOMASS COMBUSTION,

03:25:13.567 --> 03:25:14.702
GASIFICATION, AND PYROLYSIS,

03:25:14.769 --> 03:25:16.437
COMBINED WITH CARBON CAPTURE AND

03:25:16.504 --> 03:25:18.105
STORAGE. EXPERTS WARN THAT FAX

03:25:18.172 --> 03:25:20.408
IS NOT A LEGITIMATE FORM OF

03:25:20.474 --> 03:25:22.109
CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL. IT ADDS,

03:25:22.176 --> 03:25:23.611
NOT REMOVES CLIMATE AND AIR

03:25:23.678 --> 03:25:25.680
POLLUTION TO THE ATMOSPHERE.

03:25:25.746 --> 03:25:27.248
THIRD, THIS BILL ALLOWS FOR

03:25:27.314 --> 03:25:28.649

INVOLVES LARGE SCALE

03:25:30.084 --> 03:25:31.552
MANIPULATION OF THE OCEAN'S

03:25:31.619 --> 03:25:33.254
CHEMISTRY, ITS BIOLOGY, AND

03:25:33.320 --> 03:25:34.822
CIRCULATION. THESE METHODS ARE

03:25:34.889 --> 03:25:36.190
LARGELY THEORETICAL AND LACK

03:25:36.257 --> 03:25:37.925
EVIDENCE OF EFFECTIVENESS.

03:25:37.992 --> 03:25:39.060
EXPERTS WARN THAT THEY SHOULD

03:25:39.126 --> 03:25:40.628
THEY COULD CAUSE FAR REACHING

03:25:40.695 --> 03:25:42.329
HARMS TO OUR OCEAN ECOSYSTEMS,

03:25:42.396 --> 03:25:44.899
OUR FISHERIES, AND OUR VALUABLE

03:25:44.965 --> 03:25:46.233
COASTAL ECONOMIES, AND THIS BILL

03:25:46.300 --> 03:25:47.668
LACKS GUARDRAILS TO PROTECT

03:25:47.735 --> 03:25:49.170
COMMUNITIES IN THE ENVIRONMENT.

03:25:49.236 --> 03:25:50.805
THE BILL'S GESTURE TOWARD

03:25:50.871 --> 03:25:52.506
COMMUNITY BENEFIT MECHANISMS

03:25:52.573 --> 03:25:54.141
DOES NOT ADDRESS ENVIRONMENTAL

03:25:54.208 --> 03:25:56.410
JUSTICE. CONCERNS ABOUT CDR AND

03:25:56.477 --> 03:25:58.446
THE BILL'S PROVISION THAT

03:25:58.512 --> 03:26:00.681
PROJECTS BE ARE MEASURED USING

03:26:00.748 --> 03:26:02.116
UNSPECIFIED INDUSTRY PROTOCOLS

03:26:02.183 --> 03:26:03.551
WILL ALLOW HARMFUL PROJECTS TO

03:26:03.617 --> 03:26:05.686
MOVE FORWARD TO ADDRESS THE

03:26:05.753 --> 03:26:07.054
CLIMATE CRISIS. THAT STATE

03:26:07.121 --> 03:26:08.622
SHOULD INSTEAD INSTEAD

03:26:08.689 --> 03:26:09.990
ACCELERATE DIRECT EMISSIONS

03:26:10.057 --> 03:26:12.059
REDUCTIONS. FOCUS ON NATURE

03:26:12.126 --> 03:26:13.360

CDR, NOT MANDATE HARMFUL

03:26:21.969 --> 03:26:23.771
TECHNOLOGIES THAT WON'T RESULT

03:26:23.838 --> 03:26:27.708
IN REAL REDUCTIONS. THANK YOU.

03:26:27.775 --> 03:26:29.643
TWO MINUTES. THANKS. OKAY. THANK

03:26:29.710 --> 03:26:32.413

03:26:48.863 --> 03:26:50.664
BEING BENEFICIAL TO THE GLOBAL

03:26:50.731 --> 03:26:52.399
CLIMATE, YET CARRY WITH THEM

03:26:52.466 --> 03:26:53.234
EXTENSIVE RISKS AND THREATS TO

03:26:53.300 --> 03:26:55.402
PUBLIC HEALTH AND NATURAL

03:26:55.469 --> 03:26:57.338
RESOURCES. NOW, OUR ORGANIZATION

03:26:57.404 --> 03:26:58.739
IS ENGAGED FROM THE VERY

03:26:58.806 --> 03:26:59.974
BEGINNING ON THIS BILL, AND THIS

03:27:00.040 --> 03:27:01.675
IS WHERE I WOULD LIKE TO COMMEND

03:27:01.742 --> 03:27:03.410
THE STAFF OF THIS COMMITTEE,

03:27:03.477 --> 03:27:05.045
BECAUSE THE BILL ANALYSIS

03:27:05.112 --> 03:27:05.613
ACTUALLY DOES INCLUDE SOME

03:27:05.679 --> 03:27:06.881
LANGUAGE REPRESENTING OPPOSITION

03:27:06.947 --> 03:27:08.783
TO THE BILL. PREVIOUSLY, NONE OF

03:27:08.849 --> 03:27:10.551
THE BILL ANALYSIS INCLUDED ANY

03:27:10.618 --> 03:27:12.386
OF THE LANGUAGE FROM OUR LETTERS

03:27:12.453 --> 03:27:13.788
EXPRESSING CONCERN ABOUT THIS

03:27:13.854 --> 03:27:15.823
BILL. AND I WANT TO REALLY

03:27:15.890 --> 03:27:18.092
QUICKLY BRING UP SOME OF THOSE

03:27:18.159 --> 03:27:19.093
CONCERNS. THE FIRST THING IS

03:27:19.160 --> 03:27:21.495
THAT THIS BILL IGNORES EXISTING

03:27:21.562 --> 03:27:23.063
INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL

03:27:23.130 --> 03:27:24.532
AGREEMENTS. I'D LIKE TO FLAG

03:27:24.598 --> 03:27:27.034
THAT THE INTERNATIONAL MARITIME

03:27:27.101 --> 03:27:28.435
ORGANIZATION SPECIFICALLY

03:27:28.502 --> 03:27:30.237
DESCRIBES MARINE GEOENGINEERING

03:27:30.304 --> 03:27:33.440
IN TERMS THAT ELEVATE THE

03:27:33.507 --> 03:27:35.342
WORRIES ABOUT THE POTENTIAL TO

03:27:35.409 --> 03:27:37.545
RESULT IN DELETERIOUS EFFECTS,

03:27:37.611 --> 03:27:38.512
ESPECIALLY WHERE THOSE EFFECTS

03:27:38.579 --> 03:27:40.181
MAY BE WIDESPREAD, LONG LASTING,

03:27:40.247 --> 03:27:42.817
OR SEVERE. AMONGST THE

03:27:42.883 --> 03:27:44.218
TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE MENTIONED

03:27:44.285 --> 03:27:46.587
BY THE INTERNATIONAL MARITIME

03:27:46.654 --> 03:27:48.289
ORGANIZATION ARE ENHANCING OCEAN

03:27:48.355 --> 03:27:50.057
ALKALINITY AND ARTIFICIAL

03:27:50.124 --> 03:27:51.792
UPWELLING, BOTH OF WHICH ARE

03:27:51.859 --> 03:27:52.893
TECHNOLOGIES THAT THE BILL

03:27:52.960 --> 03:27:54.695
ANALYSIS IDENTIFIES AS BEING

03:27:54.762 --> 03:27:56.096
POSSIBLE TECHNOLOGIES TO BE

03:27:56.163 --> 03:27:57.965
SUPPORTED BY THIS BILL. SO

03:27:58.032 --> 03:28:00.434
THERE'S TREMENDOUS INTERNATIONAL

03:28:00.501 --> 03:28:03.404
CONCERN ABOUT THE SOCIAL JUSTICE

03:28:03.470 --> 03:28:04.905
AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF

03:28:04.972 --> 03:28:06.907
THESE TECHNOLOGIES. BUT UNTIL

03:28:06.974 --> 03:28:08.843
THIS MOMENT, NONE OF THE

03:28:08.909 --> 03:28:09.810
DISCUSSION AROUND THIS BILL HAS

03:28:09.877 --> 03:28:11.312
ADDRESSED THESE THINGS. THE

03:28:11.378 --> 03:28:13.113
COMMITTEE SHOULD ALSO BE AWARE

03:28:13.180 --> 03:28:14.849
THAT THE NOVEMBER 2024

03:28:19.987 --> 03:28:22.489
A REAFFIRMATION OF A HISTORIC

03:28:22.556 --> 03:28:23.824
DECISION ON PRECAUTIONS

03:28:23.891 --> 03:28:26.093
REGARDING GEOENGINEERING AND

03:28:26.160 --> 03:28:28.229
REAFFIRMING A CALL TO A GLOBAL

03:28:28.295 --> 03:28:30.030
MORATORIUM ON GEOENGINEERING.

03:28:30.097 --> 03:28:32.633
NOW, CALIFORNIA IS AN OBSERVER

03:28:32.700 --> 03:28:35.102
PARTY TO THE CBD. WE ENCOURAGE

03:28:35.169 --> 03:28:37.171
THE COMMITTEE TO EXERCISE

03:28:37.238 --> 03:28:39.607
CAUTION AND DUE DILIGENCE AND

03:28:39.673 --> 03:28:41.876
PUT THE BRAKES ON THIS BILL.

03:28:41.942 --> 03:28:43.244

FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ASSEMBLY

03:29:27.554 --> 03:29:33.594
MEMBER PAPPIN. SORRY. FORGIVE

03:29:33.661 --> 03:29:38.732
ME. I THINK THAT A LOT OF THIS

03:29:38.799 --> 03:29:41.001
TECHNOLOGY I WILL GIVE YOU IS

03:29:41.068 --> 03:29:43.804
NEW TECHNOLOGY. BUT I, I HAVE A

03:29:43.871 --> 03:29:44.972
DIFFERENCE OF OPINION AS IT

03:29:45.039 --> 03:29:46.974
RELATES TO THE STATE'S ROLE IN

03:29:47.041 --> 03:29:48.575
ENCOURAGING THIS TECHNOLOGY, AND

03:29:48.642 --> 03:29:50.711
I JUST DON'T SEE IT GETTING TO

03:29:50.778 --> 03:29:52.446
SCALE TO ATTRACTING INVESTMENTS.

03:29:52.513 --> 03:29:53.948
I FORGET WHICH OF THE WITNESSES.

03:29:54.014 --> 03:29:57.518
IT SAID THAT WITHOUT SOME STATE

03:29:57.584 --> 03:29:59.653
PARTICIPATION. SO I FEEL LIKE

03:29:59.720 --> 03:30:00.888
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A BIT OF A

03:30:00.955 --> 03:30:03.023

OF THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE IN

03:30:21.141 --> 03:30:22.276
THE LEGISLATURE. I THINK IT'S

03:30:22.343 --> 03:30:23.944
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. I THINK,

03:30:24.011 --> 03:30:25.412
AS YOU SAID IN YOUR OPENING

03:30:25.479 --> 03:30:28.515
COMMENTS, WE KNOW THAT CCS

03:30:28.582 --> 03:30:29.883

THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I DO

APPRECIATE THAT. WHAT WE'VE

03:30:45.799 --> 03:30:47.935
TRIED TO DO IS CREATE AN

03:30:48.002 --> 03:30:50.437
ALTERNATIVE FOR THE CARB TO BE

03:30:50.504 --> 03:30:53.007
ABLE TO LOOK AT THESE, MAKE SOME

SUGGEST GOING BY AND LOOKING.

03:31:10.657 --> 03:31:13.794
IT'S PHENOMENAL. IT'S VERY

03:31:13.861 --> 03:31:18.098
SIMPLE TECHNOLOGY AND WE NEED

03:31:18.165 --> 03:31:19.566

IT FASTER TO DELIVER THE HIGH

03:41:34.514 --> 03:41:37.050
SPEED RAIL PROJECT THAT HAS BEEN

03:41:37.117 --> 03:41:38.752
SO DELAYED THAT WE NEED TO GET

03:41:38.818 --> 03:41:40.553
VERY MUCH BACK ON TRACK,

03:42:06.980 --> 03:42:08.648
THE SUMMER. SO IT'LL BE A FUN

03:42:08.715 --> 03:42:10.417
GROUP EFFORT. AND WE'RE ALSO

03:42:10.483 --> 03:42:11.251
VERY COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH

03:42:11.317 --> 03:42:13.653
THE STAKEHOLDERS OF THE CITY'S

03:42:13.720 --> 03:42:16.289
UTILITIES, TELECOMS, ETC. AND

03:42:16.356 --> 03:42:17.657
WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT

03:42:17.724 --> 03:42:19.893
WORK. YOU KNOW WHAT THIS BILL,

03:42:19.959 --> 03:42:22.062
THIS BILL USED TO BE, IT WAS

03:42:22.128 --> 03:42:23.396
BROADER. THIS BILL ORIGINALLY,

03:42:23.463 --> 03:42:26.066
IT'S ABOUT THIRD PARTY APPROVALS

03:42:26.132 --> 03:42:28.168
AND PERMITS. WHEN WE'RE DOING

03:42:28.234 --> 03:42:30.503
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. ALL THE

03:42:30.570 --> 03:42:33.239
THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A SYSTEM THAT

03:42:33.306 --> 03:42:35.442
HAS BEEN APPROVED,

03:42:35.508 --> 03:42:37.277
ENVIRONMENTALLY CLEARED AND HAS

03:42:37.343 --> 03:42:39.279
FUNDING TO MOVE FORWARD. SO WE

03:42:39.345 --> 03:42:40.647
AS A STATE OR AS A COMMUNITY

03:42:40.714 --> 03:42:42.415
HAVE DECIDED WE ARE DOING THIS

03:42:42.482 --> 03:42:43.717
PROJECT AND HERE'S SOME MONEY TO

03:42:43.783 --> 03:42:46.953
DO IT. THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO

03:42:47.020 --> 03:42:48.688
JUST MOVE FORWARD AND DO THE

03:42:48.755 --> 03:42:50.657
PROJECT. HOWEVER, RIGHT NOW WHAT

03:42:50.724 --> 03:42:52.959
HAPPENS IS YOU THEN HAVE TO GET

03:42:53.026 --> 03:42:55.128
ENDLESS PERMITS AND PERMISSIONS,

03:42:55.195 --> 03:42:57.030
ENCROACHMENT PERMITS FROM CITIES

03:42:57.097 --> 03:42:58.498
OR FROM WATER DISTRICTS OR

03:42:58.565 --> 03:43:00.633
SPECIAL DISTRICTS. THERE MIGHT

03:43:00.700 --> 03:43:03.169
BE ELECTRIC UTILITIES OR WATER

03:43:03.236 --> 03:43:05.205
UTILITIES, OR TELECOM WIRES, OR

03:43:05.271 --> 03:43:06.973
CABLE WIRES THAT HAVE TO BE

03:43:07.040 --> 03:43:09.976
MOVED OR RELOCATED, AND IT GIVES

03:43:10.043 --> 03:43:11.611
EACH AT EACH ONE OF THESE CHOKE

03:43:11.678 --> 03:43:14.214
POINTS OR CAN BECOME A CHOKE

03:43:14.280 --> 03:43:15.181
POINT. AND THEY ALL EFFECTIVELY

03:43:15.248 --> 03:43:17.650
GET A VETO TO BASICALLY IGNORE

03:43:17.717 --> 03:43:20.787
THE REQUEST OR DELAY IT, OR DRAG

03:43:20.854 --> 03:43:23.356
THEIR FEET. AND HIGH SPEED RAIL

03:43:23.423 --> 03:43:24.991
HAS ACTUALLY HAD SITUATIONS

03:43:25.058 --> 03:43:26.793
WHERE THEY HAVE HAD TO

03:43:26.860 --> 03:43:28.561
DEMOBILIZE CONTRACTORS BECAUSE

03:43:28.628 --> 03:43:30.263
THEY'RE WAITING ON A THIRD PARTY

03:43:30.330 --> 03:43:31.898
PERMIT OR PERMISSION AND NOT

03:43:31.965 --> 03:43:34.100
GETTING A RESPONSE. AND THAT IS

03:43:34.167 --> 03:43:35.502
NOT THE WAY WE SHOULD BE

03:43:35.568 --> 03:43:36.770
SPENDING TAXPAYER DOLLARS. WE

03:43:36.836 --> 03:43:39.305
SHOULD HAVE A SYSTEM THAT WORKS

03:43:39.372 --> 03:43:40.373
TOGETHER, STAKEHOLDERS THAT WORK

03:43:40.440 --> 03:43:41.908
TOGETHER TO DELIVER PROJECTS

03:43:41.975 --> 03:43:43.810
THAT WE'VE DECIDED WE WANT TO

03:43:43.877 --> 03:43:45.945
DELIVER. WHEN THIS BILL STARTED,

03:43:46.012 --> 03:43:47.247
IT WAS MUCH BIGGER. IT APPLIED

03:43:47.313 --> 03:43:48.882
TO ALL TRANSIT SYSTEMS, NOT JUST

03:43:48.948 --> 03:43:52.318
HIGH SPEED RAIL. IT ALSO IT PUT

03:43:52.385 --> 03:43:56.022
A 30 DAY SHOT CLOCK ON ON ALL OF

03:43:56.089 --> 03:43:57.323
THESE PERMITS AND PERMISSIONS.

03:43:57.390 --> 03:43:59.893
THEY HAD 30 DAYS TO ACT AND IF

03:43:59.959 --> 03:44:01.795
NOT THE SYSTEM, THE TRANSIT

03:44:01.861 --> 03:44:03.096
SYSTEM COULD JUST MOVE FORWARD.

03:44:03.163 --> 03:44:04.531
AS I JUST SAID IN LOCAL

03:44:04.597 --> 03:44:05.765
GOVERNMENT, I THOUGHT THAT WAS A

03:44:05.832 --> 03:44:07.367
GREAT IDEA, BUT NOT EVERYONE

03:44:07.433 --> 03:44:09.302
AGREED WITH ME. SO WE HIT THE

03:44:09.369 --> 03:44:11.237
RESET BUTTON AND THE APPROACH

03:44:11.304 --> 03:44:13.273
IT'S IN THE BILL NOW IS

03:44:13.339 --> 03:44:15.141
REQUIRING EARLY ENGAGEMENT

03:44:15.208 --> 03:44:16.576
BETWEEN HIGH SPEED RAIL AND ALL

03:44:16.643 --> 03:44:18.912
OF THESE DIFFERENT ENTITIES, AND

03:44:18.978 --> 03:44:20.847
REQUIRING HIGH SPEED RAIL TO

03:44:20.914 --> 03:44:22.649
ISSUE REGULATIONS TO SET A

03:44:22.715 --> 03:44:23.950
STRUCTURE FOR HOW THIS WILL

03:44:24.017 --> 03:44:25.885
WORK, INCLUDING BINDING

03:44:25.952 --> 03:44:27.620
ARBITRATION WHEN THERE IS A

03:44:27.687 --> 03:44:29.689
DISAGREEMENT. SO WE CAN HAVE

03:44:29.756 --> 03:44:31.224
QUICK RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES. WE

03:44:31.291 --> 03:44:34.761
ARE WE'VE AGREED TO AN AMENDMENT

03:44:34.828 --> 03:44:36.596
TO SO THAT UTILITIES WILL NOT BE

03:44:36.663 --> 03:44:39.833
PART OF THE WILL NOT BE IN THE

03:44:39.899 --> 03:44:42.368
BINDING PIECE OF IT WITH THE

03:44:42.435 --> 03:44:44.737
UNDERSTANDING THAT WE DO NEED TO

03:44:44.804 --> 03:44:46.206
STRUCTURE THIS SO THAT EVERYONE,

03:44:46.272 --> 03:44:47.807
INCLUDING THE UTILITIES, ARE

03:44:47.874 --> 03:44:49.242
GOING TO BE PART OF THE

03:44:49.309 --> 03:44:50.944
SOLUTION. AND SO WE'RE HAPPY TO

03:44:51.010 --> 03:44:51.678
TAKE THE AMENDMENTS WITH THE

03:44:51.744 --> 03:44:53.680
UNDERSTANDING THAT WE'RE GOING

03:44:53.746 --> 03:44:55.014
TO KEEP WORKING, TO COME UP WITH

03:44:55.081 --> 03:44:56.182
A STRUCTURE THAT WORKS FOR

03:44:56.249 --> 03:44:57.483
EVERYONE. AND THE BILL RIGHT NOW

03:44:57.550 --> 03:44:58.651
IS ONLY HIGH SPEED RAIL. IT

03:44:58.718 --> 03:45:00.053
DOESN'T APPLY TO ANY OTHER

03:45:00.119 --> 03:45:01.888
TRANSIT SYSTEMS. BECAUSE OF THE

03:45:01.955 --> 03:45:03.489
TIME SENSITIVITY OF GETTING THIS

03:45:03.556 --> 03:45:05.892
PROJECT MOVING. WE ARE FOR THE

03:45:05.959 --> 03:45:06.893
FUTURE, LOOKING AT WAYS THAT WE

03:45:06.960 --> 03:45:08.561
CAN HELP OTHER SYSTEMS AS WELL.

03:45:08.628 --> 03:45:11.064
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH HIGH SPEED

03:45:11.130 --> 03:45:11.965
RAIL HAS BEEN PROBABLY THE MOST

03:45:12.031 --> 03:45:13.766
PROMINENT SORT OF VICTIM OF THIS

03:45:13.833 --> 03:45:16.169
SORT OF DISJOINTED SYSTEM, OTHER

03:45:16.236 --> 03:45:19.239
TRANSIT SYSTEMS ALSO EXPERIENCE

03:45:19.305 --> 03:45:21.307
IT. AND SO WITH THAT, I

03:45:21.374 --> 03:45:22.675
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN I VOTE

03:45:22.742 --> 03:45:23.776
APPRECIATE AGAIN THE CHAIR'S

03:45:23.843 --> 03:45:25.011
WORK AND ENGAGEMENT AND

03:45:25.078 --> 03:45:26.212
COMMITTEE STAFF. AND WITH ME

03:45:26.279 --> 03:45:28.381
TODAY TO TESTIFY ARE KEITH DUNN

03:45:28.448 --> 03:45:30.683
WITH THE STATE BUILDING TRADES

03:45:30.750 --> 03:45:32.318

03:45:35.989 --> 03:45:37.657
CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MARK

03:45:37.724 --> 03:45:38.925
STREETS FOR ALL. WE'RE THE

03:45:38.992 --> 03:45:40.994
SPONSOR OF SB, ONE OF THOSE, ONE

03:45:41.060 --> 03:45:42.595
OF THE SPONSORS OF SB 405

03:45:42.662 --> 03:45:43.830
BECAUSE IT IT DIRECTLY ADDRESSES

03:45:43.897 --> 03:45:45.965
ONE OF THE MOST PERSISTENT AND

03:45:46.032 --> 03:45:47.000
COSTLY PROBLEMS AFFECTING PUBLIC

03:45:47.066 --> 03:45:47.600
INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA.

03:45:47.667 --> 03:45:49.002
THIRD PARTY PERMITTING DELAYS.

03:45:49.068 --> 03:45:50.403
TODAY, THE PROCESS FOR SECURING

03:45:50.470 --> 03:45:51.537
PERMITS AND APPROVALS FROM

03:45:51.604 --> 03:45:52.739
UTILITIES, LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND

03:45:52.805 --> 03:45:55.375
OTHER THIRD PARTIES IS

03:45:55.441 --> 03:45:56.542
FRAGMENTED, INCONSISTENT AND

03:45:56.609 --> 03:45:57.710
ONEROUS. THESE THIRD PARTIES,

03:45:57.777 --> 03:45:58.845
SOME PUBLIC, SOME PRIVATE, ARE

03:45:58.912 --> 03:46:00.713
ESSENTIAL TO THE DELIVERY OF

03:46:00.780 --> 03:46:02.949
PROJECTS LIKE HIGH SPEED RAIL,

03:46:03.016 --> 03:46:04.684
YET THEY OFTEN FACE NO STATUTORY

03:46:04.751 --> 03:46:06.085
DEADLINES OR LITTLE INCENTIVE TO

03:46:06.152 --> 03:46:07.687
ACT QUICKLY. THIS CAN MEAN

03:46:07.754 --> 03:46:09.322
MULTIYEAR DELAYS FOR SOMETHING

03:46:09.389 --> 03:46:10.556
AS SIMPLE AS REVIEWING A

03:46:10.623 --> 03:46:11.925
RELOCATION PLAN OR SIGNING OFF

03:46:11.991 --> 03:46:14.294
ON A DESIGN. THIS ISN'T UNIQUE

03:46:14.360 --> 03:46:16.529
TO HIGH SPEED RAIL IN LA METRO,

03:46:16.596 --> 03:46:19.098
FOR EXAMPLE, HAS FOUND THAT

03:46:19.165 --> 03:46:19.732
GETTING PERMITS AND CLEARANCES

03:46:19.799 --> 03:46:20.366
FROM OTHER AGENCIES OFTEN ADDS

03:46:20.433 --> 03:46:21.701
BETWEEN 12 TO 18 MONTHS TO

03:46:21.768 --> 03:46:23.369
PROJECT TIMELINES. THESE ISSUES

03:46:23.436 --> 03:46:25.605
CAN EVEN AFFECT REALLY MODEST

03:46:25.672 --> 03:46:27.040
PEDESTRIAN AND BIKE SAFETY

03:46:27.106 --> 03:46:28.474
UPGRADES. THESE DELAYS ARE

03:46:28.541 --> 03:46:29.776
EXPENSIVE AND DEEPLY

03:46:29.842 --> 03:46:30.944
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. EACH MONTH OF

03:46:31.010 --> 03:46:32.712
DELAYS INCREASES LABOR LABOR

03:46:32.779 --> 03:46:34.113
COSTS, INFLATES PROJECT BUDGETS,

03:46:34.180 --> 03:46:36.015
AND DIMINISHES THE RETURN ON

03:46:36.082 --> 03:46:37.317
PUBLIC INVESTMENT. MORE

03:46:37.383 --> 03:46:38.384
IMPORTANTLY, THESE BOTTLENECKS

03:46:38.451 --> 03:46:39.652
DELAY THE BENEFIT THAT THE

03:46:39.719 --> 03:46:40.820
TAXPAYERS ARE DEMANDING OF THE

03:46:40.887 --> 03:46:43.189
STATE. THIS BILL REQUIRES HIGH

03:46:43.256 --> 03:46:44.857
SPEED RAIL TO ADOPT A CLEAR,

03:46:44.924 --> 03:46:45.992
ENFORCEABLE REGULATIONS

03:46:46.059 --> 03:46:47.794
DEVELOPED IN CONSULTATION WITH

03:46:47.860 --> 03:46:49.762
UTILITIES, CITIES AND OTHER

03:46:49.829 --> 03:46:51.130
STAKEHOLDERS. IT ENSURES EARLY

03:46:51.197 --> 03:46:52.498
ENGAGEMENT HAPPENS,

03:46:52.565 --> 03:46:53.433
RESPONSIBILITIES ARE CLEARLY

03:46:53.499 --> 03:46:54.734
DEFINED AND THAT PROJECTS DON'T

03:46:54.801 --> 03:46:56.002
GET HELD HOSTAGE BY FOOT

03:46:56.069 --> 03:46:58.004
DRAGGING OR RED TAPE. EVERY

03:46:58.071 --> 03:46:59.772
MONTH THAT WE LET THIRD PARTY

03:46:59.839 --> 03:47:01.541
PERMITTING DRAG ON TAXPAYERS

03:47:01.607 --> 03:47:03.710
LOSE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, AND

03:47:03.776 --> 03:47:05.878
CALIFORNIA'S CALIFORNIANS WAIT

03:47:05.945 --> 03:47:07.547
FOR LONGER, WAIT LONGER FOR

03:47:07.613 --> 03:47:08.815
CLEANER AND FASTER

03:47:08.881 --> 03:47:10.583
TRANSPORTATION. SB 405 IS THE

03:47:10.650 --> 03:47:12.518
FIRST BILL TO GIVE HIGH SPEED

03:47:12.585 --> 03:47:13.686
RAIL PROGRAM HARD TIMELINES,

03:47:13.753 --> 03:47:16.089
EARLY ENGAGEMENT RULES, AND A

03:47:16.155 --> 03:47:18.157
BACKSTOP BACKSTOP DISPUTE

03:47:18.224 --> 03:47:19.592
PROCESS, WHICH IS ROUGHLY THE

03:47:19.659 --> 03:47:21.027
SAME PLAYBOOK THAT CALTRANS HAS

03:47:21.094 --> 03:47:23.296
USED WITH UTILITIES FOR FREEWAYS

03:47:23.363 --> 03:47:25.798
FOR DECADES, SINCE THE 1950S. WE

03:47:25.865 --> 03:47:27.000
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

03:47:27.066 --> 03:47:29.268
THANK YOU. THANK YOU, MADAM

BIT ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF I

03:47:52.125 --> 03:47:54.127

SENATOR, THE, THE, THE

03:47:55.294 --> 03:47:55.862
IMPORTANCE OF THIS MEASURE. IT

03:47:55.928 --> 03:47:58.464
REALLY IS IMPORTANT THAT WE GET

03:47:58.531 --> 03:47:59.465
THIS RIGHT. WE SHOULD BE HAVE

03:47:59.532 --> 03:48:00.933
DONE THIS PROBABLY LONG AGO. BUT

03:48:01.000 --> 03:48:02.235
GETTING THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK,

03:48:02.301 --> 03:48:03.236

03:48:04.704 --> 03:48:06.506
AS CALIFORNIA AND THE VALLEY AND

03:48:06.572 --> 03:48:07.507
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE BAY

03:48:07.573 --> 03:48:08.508
AREA, YOU'RE GOING TO INTERACT

03:48:08.574 --> 03:48:10.209
WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT

03:48:10.276 --> 03:48:11.110
UTILITIES AND HAVE THE

03:48:11.177 --> 03:48:11.744
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE SOME

03:48:11.811 --> 03:48:12.945
DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM. IT'S

03:48:13.012 --> 03:48:13.813
IMPORTANT THAT THOSE DISCUSSIONS

03:48:13.880 --> 03:48:14.881
HAVE SOME GUARDRAILS. WE ARE

03:48:14.947 --> 03:48:17.517

GOING TO WORK WITH THE

03:48:18.651 --> 03:48:19.719
OPPONENTS. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

03:48:19.786 --> 03:48:21.788
THAT HIGH SPEED RAIL HAS THE

03:48:21.854 --> 03:48:22.455
TOOLS TO MOVE FORWARD, BECAUSE

03:48:22.522 --> 03:48:23.856
AS A SENATOR DID MENTION, THIS

03:48:23.923 --> 03:48:25.258
DOES CAUSE WORK STOPPAGES. WORK

03:48:25.324 --> 03:48:25.892
STOPPAGES COST DOLLARS. THIS

03:48:25.958 --> 03:48:29.128
PROJECT HAS HAD CHRONIC OVERRUNS

03:48:29.195 --> 03:48:30.096
AND THEY CAN BE ADDRESSED. BUT

03:48:30.163 --> 03:48:31.831
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE

03:48:31.898 --> 03:48:33.066
MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS

03:48:33.132 --> 03:48:34.967
LEGISLATION, THAT WE GET IT

03:48:35.034 --> 03:48:36.769
RIGHT, THAT WE TALK WITH OUR

03:48:36.836 --> 03:48:37.570
PARTNERS, BUT ALSO THAT THEY

03:48:37.637 --> 03:48:38.738
UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE

03:48:38.805 --> 03:48:39.806
SOME PARAMETERS AROUND THOSE

03:48:39.872 --> 03:48:40.606
DISCUSSIONS SO THAT THEY

03:48:40.673 --> 03:48:41.974
EVENTUALLY DO COME TO SOME

03:48:42.041 --> 03:48:42.942
CONCLUSION. SO WITH THAT, I WILL

03:48:43.009 --> 03:48:44.577

INFORMATION YOU SENT ME AT 6

03:53:08.974 --> 03:53:12.011
A.M. THIS MORNING. IT IS VERY

03:53:12.078 --> 03:53:13.412
THOUGHTFUL AND ARTICULATE, AND I

03:53:13.479 --> 03:53:15.081
APPRECIATE IT. AND I APPRECIATE

03:53:15.147 --> 03:53:16.415
THAT YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU

03:53:16.482 --> 03:53:18.484
ALWAYS START HERE, AND THEN YOU

03:53:18.551 --> 03:53:19.785
KIND OF NARROW THINGS DOWN. AND

03:53:19.852 --> 03:53:21.887
SO I KNOW THAT YOU'RE. THAT'S

03:53:21.954 --> 03:53:24.290
WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH THIS. AND

03:53:24.357 --> 03:53:26.492
THAT YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT THE

03:53:26.559 --> 03:53:28.094
UTILITIES ARE NOT AREN'T PART

03:53:28.160 --> 03:53:29.762
AREN'T PART OF THE BINDING PART

03:53:29.829 --> 03:53:32.898
OF THIS. SO MY QUESTION IS, ARE

03:53:32.965 --> 03:53:33.999
RATEPAYERS GOING TO BE

03:53:34.066 --> 03:53:36.769

ASSESSMENTS THAT THE UTILITIES

03:53:41.307 --> 03:53:43.709
CONDUCT? I DON'T THINK SO. I

03:53:43.776 --> 03:53:45.111
DON'T I THINK I BELIEVE THE

03:53:45.177 --> 03:53:48.080
ANSWER IS NO. OKAY. BUT YOU

03:53:48.147 --> 03:53:52.118
KNOW, BUT I THE REALITY IS THAT

03:53:52.184 --> 03:53:53.819
IF WE, YOU KNOW, UTILITIES ARE

03:53:53.886 --> 03:53:55.621
GOING TO HAVE TO BE PART OF THE

03:53:55.688 --> 03:53:57.556
SOLUTION, RIGHT? AND WE'RE GOING

03:53:57.623 --> 03:53:58.724
TO TRY TO WORK THROUGH WHAT IS

03:53:58.791 --> 03:54:00.659
WORKABLE. AND WE WOULD LOVE I MY

03:54:00.726 --> 03:54:02.495
GOAL IS TO GET TO AN AGREEMENT

03:54:02.561 --> 03:54:03.896
WITH UTILITIES AND WHAT IS

03:54:03.963 --> 03:54:06.165
WORKABLE, SO THAT WE CAN PROTECT

03:54:06.232 --> 03:54:08.801
THE INTEGRITY OF UTILITY ASSETS,

03:54:08.868 --> 03:54:12.104
PROTECT RATEPAYERS, AND MAKE

03:54:12.171 --> 03:54:13.572
SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING THIS

03:54:13.639 --> 03:54:15.841
IMPORTANT PROJECT DONE. AND SO

03:54:15.908 --> 03:54:17.610
THE UTILITIES ARE GOING TO HAVE

03:54:17.676 --> 03:54:19.612
TO PARTICIPATE AND HELP SOLVE

03:54:19.678 --> 03:54:21.847
THIS ISSUE. BUT WE WANT TO DO IT

03:54:21.914 --> 03:54:24.383
IN A WAY THAT PROTECTS THEIR

03:54:24.450 --> 03:54:27.119
ASSETS AND PROTECTS RATEPAYERS,

03:54:27.186 --> 03:54:28.788
OKAY. AND YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP

03:54:28.854 --> 03:54:29.989
MAKING EVERYBODY WORK ON THIS

03:54:30.055 --> 03:54:32.992
HOPEFULLY. YES. IS WHAT I

03:54:33.058 --> 03:54:35.161
GATHERED. YES OKAY. THANK YOU.

03:54:35.227 --> 03:54:38.731
YES. AND I CAN'T MAKE PEOPLE

03:54:38.798 --> 03:54:39.532
WORK ON IT. BUT WE'RE GOING TO

03:54:39.598 --> 03:54:41.100
INVITE YOU INVITE PEOPLE TO WORK

03:54:41.167 --> 03:54:43.769
ON IT. YOU'RE VERY CONVINCING

03:54:43.836 --> 03:54:45.571
THOUGH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROGERS.

03:54:45.638 --> 03:54:48.107
YEAH. SO JUST KIND OF

03:54:48.174 --> 03:54:49.341
PIGGYBACKING OFF OF THE

03:54:49.408 --> 03:54:51.043
QUESTION, ONE OF THE CONCERNS

03:54:51.110 --> 03:54:53.145
THAT I DO HAVE, AND WE HAVE

03:54:53.212 --> 03:54:54.079
ACTUALLY I HAVE LEGISLATION ON

03:54:54.146 --> 03:54:55.648
IT, IS THAT THERE ARE PARTS OF

03:54:55.714 --> 03:54:57.917
OUR DISTRICT THAT HAVE SEEN

03:54:57.983 --> 03:54:59.251
TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS WHERE IN

03:54:59.318 --> 03:55:02.188
WHICH STATE LAW PREVENTS SOME OF

03:55:02.254 --> 03:55:03.923
THE AGENCIES THAT ARE

03:55:03.989 --> 03:55:05.057
RESPONSIBLE FOR PLANNING,

03:55:05.124 --> 03:55:06.425
DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING. AND

03:55:06.492 --> 03:55:07.893
IN FACT, THE RELOCATION OF

03:55:07.960 --> 03:55:10.830
UTILITIES FALLS ON THE LOCAL

03:55:10.896 --> 03:55:12.431
RATEPAYERS. AND SO I WILL BE

03:55:12.498 --> 03:55:15.301
REALLY CURIOUS TO SEE HOW YOU

03:55:15.367 --> 03:55:18.337
THREAD THAT NEEDLE. YEAH. YEAH.

03:55:18.404 --> 03:55:21.273
SORRY, I DON'T KNOW. I, I THINK

03:55:21.340 --> 03:55:23.075
IT'S I THINK IT'S A FAIR

03:55:23.142 --> 03:55:24.443
CONVERSATION THAT IF YOU HAVE A

03:55:24.510 --> 03:55:25.911
PROJECT THAT IS REQUIRING

03:55:25.978 --> 03:55:28.380
RELOCATION OF UTILITIES TO FAIR

03:55:28.447 --> 03:55:29.915
CONVERSATION, TO SAY THAT THAT

03:55:29.982 --> 03:55:31.951
PROJECT SHOULD BE PARTICIPATING

03:55:32.017 --> 03:55:33.385
IN THOSE COSTS, THAT SHOULDN'T

03:55:33.452 --> 03:55:35.688
JUST BE. AND I THINK THAT'S

03:55:35.754 --> 03:55:37.790
THAT'S VERY FAIR. AND SO THAT'S

03:55:37.857 --> 03:55:39.291
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE VERY OPEN

03:55:39.358 --> 03:55:42.061
TO. AND THAT'S A WAY OF

03:55:42.127 --> 03:55:43.929
RELIEVING STRESS ON RATEPAYERS

03:55:43.996 --> 03:55:46.065
AND ON THE UTILITIES. YEAH. SO

03:55:46.131 --> 03:55:47.366
I'M JUST I'M JUST TELLING YOU

03:55:47.433 --> 03:55:48.534
BECAUSE YOU'LL BE HAVING THESE

03:55:48.601 --> 03:55:50.436
DISCUSSIONS DURING THE SUMMER.

03:55:50.503 --> 03:55:52.638
WE ACTUALLY STARTED WITH ALL

03:55:52.705 --> 03:55:53.639
PUBLIC UTILITY DISTRICTS THAT

03:55:53.706 --> 03:55:54.773
WERE HAVING THIS PROBLEM AND HAD

03:55:54.840 --> 03:55:56.842
TO NARROW IT FOR A SPECIFIC ONE.

03:55:56.909 --> 03:55:58.878
BUT THIS IS A PROBLEM, AND IT'S

03:55:58.944 --> 03:55:59.778
NOT A PROBLEM THAT'S

03:55:59.845 --> 03:56:00.913
SPECIFICALLY IN YOUR BILL. IT'S

03:56:00.980 --> 03:56:02.014
A PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE IN

03:56:02.081 --> 03:56:03.182
CALIFORNIA, WHERE SMALL PUBLIC

03:56:03.249 --> 03:56:05.184
UTILITY DISTRICTS ARE BEARING

03:56:05.251 --> 03:56:06.585
THE COST OF PROJECTS THAT THEY

03:56:06.652 --> 03:56:08.687
HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO ROLE IN

03:56:08.754 --> 03:56:10.623
PLANNING OR IMPLEMENTING BECAUSE

03:56:10.689 --> 03:56:12.791
OF THE WAY THAT STATE LAW IS

03:56:12.858 --> 03:56:14.059
WRITTEN. AND SO I'D LOVE TO SEE

03:56:14.126 --> 03:56:16.228
THAT FIXED ONE IN THIS BILL, BUT

03:56:16.295 --> 03:56:18.063
ALSO IN COORDINATION WITH THIS,

03:56:18.130 --> 03:56:20.499
THIS SPECIFIC PROJECT. THE

03:56:20.566 --> 03:56:22.434
SECOND RELATED DIRECTLY TO THAT

03:56:22.501 --> 03:56:25.371
IS ESPECIALLY YOU CALL OUT

03:56:25.437 --> 03:56:27.406
TAKING UTILITIES OUT OF THIS.

03:56:27.473 --> 03:56:29.608
THE TELECOM IS STILL IN IT AND

03:56:29.675 --> 03:56:32.111
TELECOM FALLS INTO THE SAME

03:56:32.177 --> 03:56:33.646
CATEGORY WHERE THEY'RE NOT THE

03:56:33.712 --> 03:56:34.747
ONES TYPICALLY WHO ARE ABLE.

03:56:34.813 --> 03:56:36.782
THEY DON'T OWN THE RIGHT OF WAY.

03:56:36.849 --> 03:56:37.750
THEY STILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH

03:56:37.816 --> 03:56:39.385
THE SAME CHALLENGES THAT YOU'RE

03:56:39.451 --> 03:56:40.719
TALKING ABOUT WITH ACQUIRING

03:56:40.786 --> 03:56:42.688
PERMITS TO BE THERE, RIDING ON

03:56:42.755 --> 03:56:44.690
THE UTILITY LINES OR IN THE

03:56:44.757 --> 03:56:46.191
TRENCHES. AS THEY GET TO. THEY

03:56:46.258 --> 03:56:49.695
HAVE VERY LITTLE SAY IN WHERE

03:56:49.762 --> 03:56:52.264
THEIR PROJECTS ACTUALLY END UP.

03:56:52.331 --> 03:56:53.732
WELL, THE WAY THE AMENDMENTS ARE

03:56:53.799 --> 03:56:55.367
DRAFTED, IT'S ALL UTILITIES. SO

03:56:55.434 --> 03:56:57.703
IT WOULD INCLUDE THE TELECOMS IN

03:56:57.770 --> 03:56:59.204
TERMS OF AT LEAST FOR NOW,

03:56:59.271 --> 03:57:00.706
THEY'RE NOT IN THE BINDING. SURE

03:57:00.773 --> 03:57:03.442
ABOUT THAT. THAT'S THE WAY WE

03:57:03.509 --> 03:57:05.678
READ IT. YEAH OKAY. THAT'S

03:57:05.744 --> 03:57:07.179
TELECOM DOESN'T SEEM TO THINK SO

03:57:07.246 --> 03:57:09.014
OKAY. SO WE CAN GET THAT SORTED

03:57:09.081 --> 03:57:10.049
OUT. YEAH. AND REGARDLESS THAT'S

03:57:10.115 --> 03:57:12.318
OUR POSITION TOO. YEAH I BELIEVE

03:57:12.384 --> 03:57:16.188
THE OUR COMMITTEE IS NODDING. SO

03:57:16.255 --> 03:57:18.424
YEAH. BUT REGARDLESS THESE ARE

03:57:18.490 --> 03:57:20.960
ALL IT'S ALL GOING TO BE SUBJECT

03:57:21.026 --> 03:57:21.894
TO CONVERSATION. BUT YOU KNOW

03:57:21.961 --> 03:57:23.629
WHAT WE'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT

03:57:23.696 --> 03:57:26.098
HERE IS IT'S ALSO ABOUT

03:57:26.165 --> 03:57:26.765
RESPONSIVENESS. AND I'M NOT THIS

03:57:26.832 --> 03:57:29.335
IS NOT A CRITICISM OF ANYONE.

03:57:29.401 --> 03:57:31.270
EVERYONE'S FOCUSED ON WHATEVER

03:57:31.337 --> 03:57:32.738
IT IS THEY'RE DOING TO RUN THEIR

03:57:32.805 --> 03:57:33.806
BUSINESS, TO RUN THEIR

03:57:33.872 --> 03:57:36.208
ORGANIZATION. BUT WHEN BUT THERE

03:57:36.275 --> 03:57:37.743
WHAT THERE ARE TIMES THERE ARE

03:57:37.810 --> 03:57:39.445
TIMES WHEN THERE MIGHT BE

03:57:39.511 --> 03:57:40.112
SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY

03:57:40.179 --> 03:57:41.614
COMPLICATED AND HARD. THERE ARE

03:57:41.680 --> 03:57:43.315
OTHER TIMES WHERE THERE'S JUST

03:57:43.382 --> 03:57:43.983
NOT A RESPONSE. I'M NOT POINTING

03:57:44.049 --> 03:57:45.084
TO ANY PARTICULAR ENTITY. IT

03:57:45.150 --> 03:57:46.719
JUST DOES HAPPEN SOMETIMES WHERE

03:57:46.785 --> 03:57:48.520
HIGH SPEED RAIL IS LIKE, HEY, WE

03:57:48.587 --> 03:57:49.788
NEED TO BUILD A BRIDGE OVER THIS

03:57:49.855 --> 03:57:51.690
GULLY AND THERE'S A WIRE HERE.

03:57:51.757 --> 03:57:53.559
CAN WE FIGURE OUT HOW TO LIKE,

03:57:53.626 --> 03:57:55.327
DEAL WITH THAT AND NOT EVEN

03:57:55.394 --> 03:57:56.395
GETTING A RESPONSE. AND THEY

03:57:56.462 --> 03:57:57.730
HAVE TO DEMOBILIZE THE

03:57:57.796 --> 03:57:58.664
CONTRACTOR. SO THAT'S NOT EVEN

03:57:58.731 --> 03:58:00.633
LIKE A BURDEN OR COST ISSUE.

03:58:00.699 --> 03:58:02.501
THAT'S JUST LIKE, HEY, LET'S ALL

03:58:02.568 --> 03:58:05.738
WORK ON THIS TOGETHER AND HAVE

03:58:05.804 --> 03:58:06.372
RESPONSIVENESS. AND YOU

03:58:06.438 --> 03:58:07.573
SHOULDN'T HAVE TO LEGISLATE THAT

03:58:07.640 --> 03:58:09.008
IN AN IDEAL WORLD. BUT SOMETIMES

03:58:09.074 --> 03:58:12.144
YOU DO, I GET IT. AND THEN LAST

03:58:12.211 --> 03:58:13.712
THING, LAST QUESTION. AND IT'S

03:58:13.779 --> 03:58:15.814
IT IS A LITTLE BIT OF A

03:58:15.881 --> 03:58:17.616
FRUSTRATION. I KNOW WE WERE ALL

03:58:17.683 --> 03:58:18.817
LAUGHING AND JOKING ABOUT HOW

03:58:18.884 --> 03:58:21.320
MUCH WORK THIS BILL IS GOING TO

03:58:21.387 --> 03:58:22.688
HAVE IN THE SUMMER, BUT I'VE

03:58:22.755 --> 03:58:24.790
SEEN THIS TWICE THIS WEEK. I

03:58:24.857 --> 03:58:27.459
KNOW THAT BY THE NEXT TIME I SEE

03:58:27.526 --> 03:58:28.927
IT, THE BILL IS GOING TO BE

03:58:28.994 --> 03:58:29.862
SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT THAN IT

03:58:29.928 --> 03:58:31.664
IS AT THE VERY END OF THE

03:58:31.730 --> 03:58:32.865
PROCESS. WE HAVE THREE COMMITTEE

03:58:32.931 --> 03:58:34.733
HEARINGS THAT THIS BILL HAS BEEN

03:58:34.800 --> 03:58:35.634
THROUGH. AND I THINK FROM WHAT I

03:58:35.701 --> 03:58:37.836
HEAR FROM GROUPS IS THAT THEY

03:58:37.903 --> 03:58:39.071
DON'T YET KNOW HOW THIS BILL IS

03:58:39.138 --> 03:58:40.773
GOING TO IMPACT THEM. SO THE

03:58:40.839 --> 03:58:42.574
QUESTION IS, HOW ARE YOU GOING

03:58:42.641 --> 03:58:43.676
TO ENGAGE STAKEHOLDERS? HOW ARE

03:58:43.742 --> 03:58:44.910
YOU GOING TO DO THAT STAKEHOLDER

03:58:44.977 --> 03:58:46.745
ENGAGEMENT DURING THE SUMMER?

03:58:46.812 --> 03:58:48.113
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THERE IS

03:58:48.180 --> 03:58:49.715
SOME FEAR OUT THERE THAT IF

03:58:49.782 --> 03:58:51.350
YOU'RE NOT ONE OF THE COOL KIDS

03:58:51.417 --> 03:58:53.218
AT THE TABLE, THAT YOU'RE JUST

03:58:53.285 --> 03:58:54.987
GOING TO END UP HAVING A BILL

03:58:55.054 --> 03:58:56.689
SPIT OUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE

03:58:56.755 --> 03:58:57.523
FLOOR WITH NO REAL MEANINGFUL

03:58:57.589 --> 03:58:59.358
OPPORTUNITY FOR ENGAGEMENT OR

03:58:59.425 --> 03:59:01.126
AMENDMENTS AT THAT POINT? WELL,

03:59:01.193 --> 03:59:02.728
SOMEONE WHO WAS NOT ONE OF THE

03:59:02.795 --> 03:59:04.797
COOL KIDS GROWING UP, I'M VERY

03:59:04.863 --> 03:59:06.699
SENSITIVE TO THAT. AND SO WE'RE

03:59:06.765 --> 03:59:07.366
NOT JUST GOING TO LIMIT

03:59:07.433 --> 03:59:09.468
OURSELVES TO THE COOL KIDS. BUT

03:59:09.535 --> 03:59:10.769
NO, WE I THINK ANYONE WHO'S EVER

03:59:10.836 --> 03:59:12.871
WORKED WITH ME ON A BILL KNOWS I

03:59:12.938 --> 03:59:14.506
WE'VE NOT JUST OPEN DOOR, BUT

03:59:14.573 --> 03:59:16.275
WE'RE THE GOOD NEWS IS ABOUT

03:59:16.341 --> 03:59:18.577
HAVING THE HEARINGS WE'VE HAD IN

03:59:18.644 --> 03:59:20.612
THE LAST FEW DAYS. BUT ALSO

03:59:20.679 --> 03:59:22.147
WHAT'S HAPPENED THE LAST FEW

03:59:22.214 --> 03:59:23.582
WEEKS IS I THINK WE HAVE A VERY

03:59:23.649 --> 03:59:25.751
WE'VE ALWAYS HAD A GOOD IDEA

03:59:25.818 --> 03:59:26.785
ABOUT WHO THE KEY STAKEHOLDERS

03:59:26.852 --> 03:59:28.587
ARE. BUT NOW WE KNOW EVEN MORE

03:59:28.654 --> 03:59:29.755
AND WE'RE ARE GOING TO ENGAGE

03:59:29.822 --> 03:59:31.156
WITH EVERYONE. I CAN'T GUARANTEE

03:59:31.223 --> 03:59:31.824
THAT EVERYONE'S GOING TO. YOU'RE

03:59:31.890 --> 03:59:34.193
NEVER GOING TO GET UNANIMOUS

03:59:34.259 --> 03:59:35.394
SUPPORT FOR EVERYTHING. AND IF

03:59:35.461 --> 03:59:37.162
WE BUT IF WE DON'T DO A GOOD

03:59:37.229 --> 03:59:38.964
JOB, THEN THIS BILL IS GOING TO

03:59:39.031 --> 03:59:39.765
STRUGGLE ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR.

03:59:39.832 --> 03:59:43.569
AND SO, YOU KNOW, SO I HAVE MY

03:59:43.635 --> 03:59:45.237
AND I SAID THIS IN LOCAL

03:59:45.304 --> 03:59:46.105
GOVERNMENT, I'LL SAY IT AGAIN.

03:59:46.171 --> 03:59:48.841
MY THE PLAN HERE IS NOT TO BE

03:59:48.907 --> 03:59:51.376
LIKE OKAY, WE GOT OUT OF

03:59:51.443 --> 03:59:51.977
COMMITTEE BY EVERYONE. LIKE IF

03:59:52.044 --> 03:59:53.746
WE DON'T HAVE BROAD SUPPORT

03:59:53.812 --> 03:59:56.014
AROUND THIS AND STAKEHOLDERS

03:59:56.081 --> 03:59:58.851
FROM COMMITTEE CHAIRS, THEN IT'S

03:59:58.917 --> 04:00:01.120
NOT GOING TO WORK. SO WE REALLY

04:00:01.186 --> 04:00:03.856
WANT TO BUILD TOWARDS AS MUCH

04:00:03.922 --> 04:00:05.591
CONSENSUS AS WE CAN GET. YEAH.

04:00:05.657 --> 04:00:07.960
AND I AND I GET THAT AND I KNOW

04:00:08.026 --> 04:00:09.261
THAT YOU CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT

04:00:09.328 --> 04:00:10.629
EVERYBODY WILL HAVE A SEAT AT

04:00:10.696 --> 04:00:12.531
THE TABLE. BUT WHAT DOES

04:00:12.598 --> 04:00:13.565
GUARANTEE PEOPLE HAVE THEIR

04:00:13.632 --> 04:00:15.000
VOICE HEARD? OR IS THE COMMITTEE

04:00:15.067 --> 04:00:17.536
HEARINGS AND THE BILL IS GOING

04:00:17.603 --> 04:00:18.103
TO BE THROUGH FUNCTIONALLY,

04:00:18.170 --> 04:00:19.471
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM, BEFORE

04:00:19.538 --> 04:00:22.508
WE HAVE A BILL THAT'S IN PRINT

04:00:22.574 --> 04:00:24.877
FOR PEOPLE TO RESPOND TO. YEAH.

04:00:24.943 --> 04:00:26.645
THANK YOU. AND JUST TO FOLLOW UP

04:00:26.712 --> 04:00:28.013
ON THE FIRST POINT THAT YOU WERE

04:00:28.080 --> 04:00:30.582
MAKING, THERE IS STATE LAW THAT

04:00:30.649 --> 04:00:31.183
REQUIRES FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL

04:00:31.250 --> 04:00:34.486
THAT THEY PAY FOR ANY MOVING OF

04:00:34.553 --> 04:00:35.821
UTILITIES. AND THE AMENDMENTS

04:00:35.888 --> 04:00:37.823
ARE GOING TO POINT TO THAT.

04:00:37.890 --> 04:00:40.592
WE'LL POINT TO THAT. AND

04:00:40.659 --> 04:00:44.930
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. SO I KNOW WE I,

04:00:44.997 --> 04:00:49.501
I SPOKE IN TRANSPORTATION AND I

04:00:49.568 --> 04:00:50.969
JUST KIND OF WANT TO REITERATE

04:00:51.036 --> 04:00:52.838
TO MAKE SURE THAT I WAS CLEAR AS

04:00:52.905 --> 04:00:55.140
IT RELATED TO LOCAL AGENCIES. SO

04:00:55.207 --> 04:00:57.042
LET ME GET OUT OF THE WAY. OF

04:00:57.109 --> 04:00:57.676
COURSE, I UNDERSTAND THE NEED

04:00:57.743 --> 04:01:00.145
FOR THE BILL THAT I'M NOT GOING

04:01:00.212 --> 04:01:01.146
TO DISPUTE AT ALL. AS I

04:01:01.213 --> 04:01:02.714
MENTIONED, I HAVE A LITTLE

04:01:02.781 --> 04:01:05.083
CONCERN ABOUT THE FOX WITH THE

04:01:05.150 --> 04:01:05.717
CHICKENS, BUT I WANT TO MAYBE

04:01:05.784 --> 04:01:06.585
ARTICULATE A LITTLE BIT MORE.

04:01:06.652 --> 04:01:08.387
HIGH SPEED RAIL DEVELOPS REGS

04:01:08.453 --> 04:01:09.788
THAT APPLY TO HIGH SPEED RAIL,

04:01:09.855 --> 04:01:11.790
ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO

04:01:11.857 --> 04:01:14.092
RIGHTS OF WAY AND LOCAL CITIES,

04:01:14.159 --> 04:01:16.528
BECAUSE, AS YOU KNOW, WHEN HIGH

04:01:16.595 --> 04:01:17.863
SPEED RAIL COMES UP THE

04:01:17.930 --> 04:01:18.730
PENINSULA, MY DISTRICT, THOSE

04:01:18.797 --> 04:01:20.566
ARE VERY TIGHT QUARTERS. AND SO

04:01:20.632 --> 04:01:23.468
I DO HAVE SOME CONCERN ABOUT

04:01:23.535 --> 04:01:25.437
FULL AND ROBUST SAY THAT CITIES

04:01:25.504 --> 04:01:27.005
MIGHT HAVE. SO AS YOU WORK OVER

04:01:27.072 --> 04:01:29.875
THE SUMMER, I THOUGHT I WOULD AT

04:01:29.942 --> 04:01:31.710
LEAST KEEP THAT IN THE BACK OF

04:01:31.777 --> 04:01:33.245
YOUR MIND. AND I APPRECIATE YOUR

04:01:33.312 --> 04:01:34.446
RECEPTIVITY TO MY CONCERNS ABOUT

04:01:34.513 --> 04:01:36.949
IT, BUT HAVE NO NO ISSUE THAT

04:01:37.015 --> 04:01:38.584
THERE IS A NEED FOR THIS BILL

04:01:38.650 --> 04:01:40.185
AND THAT IT HAS COST MORE MONEY.

04:01:40.252 --> 04:01:43.655
IT HAS DELAYED. AND I JUST WANT

04:01:43.722 --> 04:01:45.123
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T, IF

04:01:45.190 --> 04:01:46.758
YOU'LL EXCUSE THE PUN, RAILROAD

04:01:46.825 --> 04:01:49.127
OVER THE CITIES AS WE GO

04:01:49.194 --> 04:01:49.628
THROUGH. THAT'S RIGHT, I

04:01:49.695 --> 04:01:52.097
COULDN'T RESIST. SO THANK YOU

04:01:52.164 --> 04:01:53.365
FOR YOUR EFFORTS. THANK YOU.

04:01:53.432 --> 04:01:55.467

WANT TO TOUCH ON A LITTLE BIT OF

04:02:01.006 --> 04:02:02.708
WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROGERS DID.

04:02:02.774 --> 04:02:04.142
I APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT

04:02:04.209 --> 04:02:06.345

YOU KNOW LABOR WILL BE INVOLVED

04:02:31.203 --> 04:02:32.704
THE OF COURSE HIGH SPEED RAIL

04:02:32.771 --> 04:02:33.805
WILL WORK WITH THE

04:02:33.872 --> 04:02:35.073
ADMINISTRATION, WORK WITH THE

04:02:35.140 --> 04:02:36.008

DISCUSSION. WE HAD BY TEXT THIS

04:03:12.577 --> 04:03:14.012
MORNING. I'M PREPARED TO SUPPORT

04:03:14.079 --> 04:03:17.849
THE BILL. I LOOK AT IT FROM TWO

04:03:17.916 --> 04:03:18.917
PERSPECTIVES. ONE, I REMEMBER AT

04:03:18.984 --> 04:03:20.786
ONE POINT IN WHEN I WAS A YOUNG

04:03:20.852 --> 04:03:22.321
LAWYER, WHERE I ACTUALLY WAS

04:03:22.387 --> 04:03:23.855
RESPONSIBLE WITH A TEAM TO

04:03:23.922 --> 04:03:26.291
PERMIT A LONG LINE FIBER OPTIC

04:03:26.358 --> 04:03:28.026
CABLE THAT RAN FROM LOS ANGELES

04:03:28.093 --> 04:03:29.761
ALL THE WAY UP TO SEATTLE, AND

04:03:29.828 --> 04:03:32.698
UNDERSTANDING SORT OF THE

04:03:32.764 --> 04:03:34.800
PERMITTING PROCESS THAT IS

04:03:34.866 --> 04:03:36.535
INVOLVED WITH ANYTHING THAT'S A

04:03:36.601 --> 04:03:37.936
LINEAR PROJECT THAT GOES THROUGH

04:03:38.003 --> 04:03:39.905
A LOT OF PROPERTY. SO DEFINITELY

04:03:39.972 --> 04:03:43.608
NEEDED. AND THEN, YOU KNOW, IN

04:03:43.675 --> 04:03:44.843
ADDITION TO THAT, REMEMBERING

04:03:44.910 --> 04:03:46.411
LAST SUMMER WHEN I WAS GETTING

04:03:46.478 --> 04:03:49.081
ON TO A HIGH SPEED RAIL IN

04:03:49.147 --> 04:03:51.650
MADRID, HEADING TO BARCELONA,

04:03:51.717 --> 04:03:53.185
THINKING THAT IT SHOULDN'T TAKE

04:03:53.251 --> 04:03:55.988
SO LONG TO GIVE THE CALIFORNIA

04:03:56.054 --> 04:03:57.923
PUBLIC WHAT PEOPLE HAVE ALL OVER

04:03:57.990 --> 04:04:00.158
THE FRIGGIN WORLD. AND, YOU

04:04:00.225 --> 04:04:02.194
KNOW, IT'S WE'VE INVESTED IN

04:04:02.260 --> 04:04:03.762
THIS ALREADY. WE CAN'T LET THIS

04:04:03.829 --> 04:04:05.764
BE SOMETHING WHICH GOES FROM AS

04:04:05.831 --> 04:04:07.599
MUCH AS I LOVE THE CENTRAL

04:04:07.666 --> 04:04:09.868
VALLEY, FROM ONE PLACE IN THE

04:04:09.935 --> 04:04:10.502
CENTRAL VALLEY TO ANOTHER PLACE

04:04:10.569 --> 04:04:11.803
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY, WE NEED

04:04:11.870 --> 04:04:14.439
TO BRING IT UP TO THE BAY AREA

04:04:14.506 --> 04:04:15.540
AND BACK DOWN TO LOS ANGELES.

04:04:15.607 --> 04:04:18.110
AND THIS IS JUST A VERY NEEDED,

04:04:18.176 --> 04:04:20.612
VERY NEEDED BILL. AND SO I JUST

04:04:20.679 --> 04:04:21.980
WANT TO THANK YOU FOR IT AND

04:04:22.047 --> 04:04:23.782
WE'LL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY.

04:04:23.849 --> 04:04:24.649
THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

04:04:24.716 --> 04:04:26.952
SCHULTZ. YES, THANK YOU VERY

04:04:27.019 --> 04:04:28.353
MUCH, SENATOR, FOR THE

04:04:28.420 --> 04:04:29.921
PRESENTATION. THANK YOU TO ALL

04:04:29.988 --> 04:04:30.956
THE WITNESSES FOR YOUR

04:04:31.023 --> 04:04:32.691
TESTIMONY. JUST TO GET RIGHT TO

04:04:32.758 --> 04:04:34.459
THE POINT, SENATOR, I DO PLAN TO

04:04:34.526 --> 04:04:35.861
SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY. I KNOW

04:04:35.927 --> 04:04:37.696
THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF COMMENT

04:04:37.763 --> 04:04:39.731
LETTERS, AND I DID WANT TO JUST

04:04:39.798 --> 04:04:40.799
RAISE THE CONCERNS FROM MY

04:04:40.866 --> 04:04:41.733
DISTRICT ABOUT ONE SPECIFIC

04:04:41.800 --> 04:04:43.502
COMMENT LETTER. AND MY ASK IS

04:04:43.568 --> 04:04:44.936
THAT I HOPE THAT YOU'LL CONTINUE

04:04:45.003 --> 04:04:45.971
TO WORK SPECIFICALLY WITH THE

04:04:46.038 --> 04:04:47.606
CITY OF BURBANK. I KNOW THAT

04:04:47.672 --> 04:04:49.741
THIS IS IT'S VERY DISTRICT

04:04:49.808 --> 04:04:50.876
SPECIFIC, BUT AS YOU KNOW, HIGH

04:04:50.942 --> 04:04:51.676
SPEED RAIL DOES ANTICIPATE

04:04:51.743 --> 04:04:52.878
HAVING A STATION IN THE CITY OF

04:04:52.944 --> 04:04:54.513
BURBANK. THE CITY HAS RAISED

04:04:54.579 --> 04:04:55.614
CONCERNS THAT THE PLACEMENT OF

04:04:55.680 --> 04:04:57.082
THAT STATION MIGHT IMPACT THE

04:04:57.149 --> 04:04:58.617
BURBANK OPERABLE UNIT. THE BIÂU,

04:04:58.683 --> 04:05:00.352
WHICH ADMINISTERS A SUPERFUND

04:05:00.419 --> 04:05:02.320
SITE. AND THOSE IMPACTS COULD

04:05:02.387 --> 04:05:04.222
IMPACT THE CITY'S ABILITY TO

04:05:04.289 --> 04:05:05.657
PROVIDE SAFE AND CLEAN DRINKING

04:05:05.724 --> 04:05:07.459
WATER TO THE COMMUNITY. SO FOR

04:05:07.526 --> 04:05:08.693
TODAY'S PURPOSES, MORE THAN

04:05:08.760 --> 04:05:10.529
HAPPY TO GIVE YOU THE I VOTE. I

04:05:10.595 --> 04:05:13.098
WOULD JUST ASK THAT YOU CONTINUE

04:05:13.165 --> 04:05:13.965
TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO

04:05:14.032 --> 04:05:14.666
IMPACTED COMMUNITIES LIKE

04:05:14.733 --> 04:05:17.069
BURBANK AS YOU'RE MOVING THE

04:05:17.135 --> 04:05:20.372
BILL FORWARD. THANK YOU SIR. AND

04:05:20.439 --> 04:05:22.174
ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERNER. HI.

04:05:22.240 --> 04:05:23.241
THANK YOU, SENATOR, FOR BRINGING

04:05:23.308 --> 04:05:24.943
THIS FORWARD. UNLIKE MY

04:05:25.010 --> 04:05:26.344
COLLEAGUES, I WON'T BE

04:05:26.411 --> 04:05:28.180
SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY. AND

04:05:28.246 --> 04:05:29.047
WE'VE WE'VE GONE BACK AND FORTH,

04:05:29.114 --> 04:05:31.917
AND I THINK BETWEEN MY STAFF AND

04:05:31.983 --> 04:05:32.918
YOUR STAFF, YOU UNDERSTAND WHY

04:05:32.984 --> 04:05:34.886
WE DON'T NEED TO MAKE THAT, YOU

04:05:34.953 --> 04:05:36.521
KNOW, REHASH ALL THAT HERE. I DO

04:05:36.588 --> 04:05:38.990
WANT TO FLAG FOR YOU WHEN WE'RE

04:05:39.057 --> 04:05:41.493
LOOKING AT ANY OVERLAP BETWEEN

04:05:41.560 --> 04:05:43.728
CALTRANS AND THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

04:05:43.795 --> 04:05:45.564
AND THE MIDDLE MILE, WE'RE

04:05:45.630 --> 04:05:48.333
GETTING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN

04:05:48.400 --> 04:05:49.167
FEDERAL INVESTMENT FOR THE

04:05:49.234 --> 04:05:53.405
MIDDLE MILE. AND TO ASK CALTRANS

04:05:53.472 --> 04:05:55.941
OR ANY OF THE MIDDLE MILE

04:05:56.007 --> 04:05:57.509
AGENCIES THAT WILL BE

04:05:57.576 --> 04:05:59.244
MAINTAINING THAT RIGHT OF WAY TO

04:05:59.311 --> 04:06:00.979
MOVE IT AT A LATER POINT WILL BE

04:06:01.046 --> 04:06:03.448
VERY COSTLY AND KIND OF DEFEAT

04:06:03.515 --> 04:06:04.683
THE PURPOSE OF THE FEDERAL

04:06:04.749 --> 04:06:06.051
INVESTMENT IN BROADBAND. SO WHEN

04:06:06.118 --> 04:06:07.586
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THAT AND

04:06:07.652 --> 04:06:09.121
LOOKING AT THEM, I HAVEN'T

04:06:09.187 --> 04:06:10.222
LOOKED AT THEM. OVERLAP BETWEEN

04:06:10.288 --> 04:06:12.124
MIDDLE MILE, CALTRANS AND HIGH

04:06:12.190 --> 04:06:13.592
SPEED RAIL AND WHERE THOSE

04:06:13.658 --> 04:06:15.293
OVERLAPS ARE. BUT PLEASE KEEP

04:06:15.360 --> 04:06:16.828
THOSE IN MIND. ABSOLUTELY. AND

04:06:16.895 --> 04:06:18.463
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THAT

04:06:18.530 --> 04:06:20.532
HAS TO BE DELIVERED IN THE NEXT

04:06:20.599 --> 04:06:22.667
IT. SO ONCE IT GETS DELIVERED

04:06:22.734 --> 04:06:24.436
AND YOU WANT THEM TO MOVE IT FOR

04:06:24.503 --> 04:06:25.604
HIGH SPEED RAIL, RIGHT. THAT'S

04:06:25.670 --> 04:06:27.706
THE PROBLEM. YEAH. AND MOVES IT

04:06:27.772 --> 04:06:29.341
AT WHAT COST. AFTER INVESTING

04:06:29.407 --> 04:06:32.811
BILLIONS. YEAH I DON'T I DON'T

04:06:32.878 --> 04:06:35.647
KNOW IF YOU WANT TO COMMENT I

04:06:35.714 --> 04:06:36.915
THANK YOU. AND THROUGH THE CHAIR

04:06:36.982 --> 04:06:38.750
I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THE HIGH

04:06:38.817 --> 04:06:40.552
SPEED RAIL ALIGNMENT IS SET. AND

04:06:40.619 --> 04:06:42.888
THEY HAVE WORKED WITH THE

04:06:42.954 --> 04:06:43.555
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AS

04:06:43.622 --> 04:06:44.956
WELL AS THE MIDDLE MILE. IT'S

04:06:45.023 --> 04:06:45.790
HOPEFULLY GOING TO BE SUPPORTIVE

04:06:45.857 --> 04:06:47.292
OF THAT PROGRAM AND UTILIZE SOME

04:06:47.359 --> 04:06:49.294
OF THOSE SERVICES ON THE SYSTEM.

04:06:49.361 --> 04:06:50.795
SO, YOU KNOW, MAYBE THERE MIGHT

04:06:50.862 --> 04:06:53.265
BE SOME POINT IN WHICH THERE MAY

04:06:53.331 --> 04:06:54.132
BE A LITTLE ADJUSTMENT. BUT I

04:06:54.199 --> 04:06:55.667
THINK THAT THEY ARE COORDINATING

04:06:55.734 --> 04:06:57.068
PRETTY WELL BETWEEN CALLISTA,

04:06:57.135 --> 04:06:58.336
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION,

04:06:58.403 --> 04:06:58.904
THIS ADMINISTRATION, AND AT

04:06:58.970 --> 04:07:00.539
LEAST THE PREVIOUS FEDERAL

04:07:00.605 --> 04:07:02.140
ADMINISTRATION. I WON'T SPEAK

04:07:02.207 --> 04:07:03.742
FOR THE CURRENT, BUT I DO KNOW

04:07:03.808 --> 04:07:05.110
THAT THERE HAS BEEN DISCUSSION

04:07:05.877 --> 04:07:07.379
HOPEFULLY THIS IS GOING TO WORK

04:07:07.445 --> 04:07:08.847
IN PARTNERSHIP TO SUPPORT ALL

04:07:08.914 --> 04:07:09.447

04:07:09.514 --> 04:07:10.949
ALREADY A PROCESS IN PLACE FOR

04:07:11.016 --> 04:07:11.917
BUILDING THE MIDDLE MILE, AND

04:07:11.983 --> 04:07:13.952

MIDDLE MILE AFTER IT'S BUILT

04:07:28.200 --> 04:07:30.335
WILL COME AT THE COST OF

04:07:30.402 --> 04:07:30.936
CONSUMERS. THERE'S NO OTHER.

04:07:31.002 --> 04:07:32.804
THERE'S NO OTHER MECHANISM IN

04:07:32.871 --> 04:07:34.639
PLACE FOR IT NOT TO BE AT COST

04:07:34.706 --> 04:07:36.474
OF CONSUMERS. SO HOPEFULLY THEY

04:07:36.541 --> 04:07:37.943
