00:44:26.864 --> 00:44:28.699
THEIR CAL GRANT APPLICATION.

00:44:28.766 --> 00:44:30.000
RIGHT NOW, THESE SYSTEMS ARE

00:44:30.067 --> 00:44:31.602
TOTALLY SEPARATE, SO THEY WOULD

00:44:31.668 --> 00:44:33.637
HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING UNLESS

00:44:33.704 --> 00:44:34.638
THEY ALSO GO DOWN AND APPLY FOR

00:44:34.705 --> 00:44:35.906
CALFRESH SEPARATELY. I DO ACCEPT

00:44:35.973 --> 00:44:37.908
THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS FROM THE

00:44:37.975 --> 00:44:39.143

00:44:39.209 --> 00:44:40.978
THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR HELPING

00:44:41.045 --> 00:44:43.747
IMPROVE THE BILL. SB 761 EXPANDS

00:44:43.814 --> 00:44:45.516
THE PROGRAMS OF STUDY THAT

00:44:45.582 --> 00:44:46.583
INCREASES A STUDENT'S

00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:48.085
ELIGIBILITY FOR CALFRESH, AS

00:44:48.152 --> 00:44:49.420
WELL AS CREATING THE

00:44:49.486 --> 00:44:51.622
NOTIFICATION SYSTEM. HALF OF

00:44:51.688 --> 00:44:53.023
CALIFORNIA'S COLLEGE STUDENTS

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:54.825
EXPERIENCE FOOD INSECURITY,

00:44:54.892 --> 00:44:55.859
ENCOUNTERING BARRIERS THAT MAKE

00:44:55.926 --> 00:44:57.761
IT DIFFICULT TO ACCESS CALFRESH

00:44:57.828 --> 00:45:00.297
BENEFITS, AND THEY ENCOUNTER

00:45:00.364 --> 00:45:01.398
BARRIERS THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT

00:45:01.465 --> 00:45:04.001
TO ACCESS THESE PROGRAMS THAT

00:45:04.068 --> 00:45:05.335
ULTIMATELY JUST FEEDING

00:45:05.402 --> 00:45:06.637
THEMSELVES BECOMES AN ISSUE. AND

00:45:06.703 --> 00:45:09.006
I WAS IN COLLEGE, I WAS A YOUNG,

00:45:09.073 --> 00:45:10.374
SINGLE MOM, AND I USED FOOD

00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:12.276
STAMPS TO MAKE ENDS MEET FOR

00:45:12.342 --> 00:45:14.244
MYSELF AND MY SON. SO THIS BILL

00:45:14.311 --> 00:45:16.480
IS A MODEST BUT IMPORTANT WOULD

00:45:16.547 --> 00:45:18.082
HAVE HELPED ME TREMENDOUSLY. ONE

00:45:18.148 --> 00:45:20.784
LESS SYSTEM TO NAVIGATE. SO I

00:45:20.851 --> 00:45:22.386
APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE HEARING

00:45:22.453 --> 00:45:24.254

MILLION COLLEGE EDUCATED WORKERS

00:45:47.811 --> 00:45:49.913
BY 2030. AND PROSPECTIVE

00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:51.415
STUDENTS NAME THE COST OF

00:45:51.482 --> 00:45:53.217
COLLEGE AS A MAJOR BARRIER TO

00:45:53.283 --> 00:45:54.551
CLOSE THIS GAP, CALIFORNIA

00:45:54.618 --> 00:45:55.986
COMPETES HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON

00:45:56.053 --> 00:45:57.688
MAKING COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE

00:45:57.754 --> 00:45:59.056
NOT JUST TUITION, BUT THE FULL

00:45:59.123 --> 00:46:01.125
COST OF BEING A STUDENT. THAT

00:46:01.191 --> 00:46:02.593
INCLUDES FOOD. WITH MORE THAN 1

00:46:02.659 --> 00:46:03.961

WITH FOOD INSECURITY, WE KNOW

00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:07.598
HUNGER IS A REAL AND GROWING

00:46:07.664 --> 00:46:09.466
BARRIER TO COLLEGE SUCCESS.

00:46:09.533 --> 00:46:10.467
STUDIES SHOW THAT STUDENTS WHO

00:46:10.534 --> 00:46:12.603
ARE FOOD INSECURE ARE 43% LESS

00:46:12.669 --> 00:46:14.605
LIKELY TO GRADUATE, AND THAT'S

00:46:14.671 --> 00:46:16.406
NOT UNSURPRISING. IF STUDENTS

00:46:16.473 --> 00:46:18.308
ARE HUNGRY, IT'S HARDER TO FOCUS

00:46:18.375 --> 00:46:19.776
TO ATTEND CLASS, AND THEY'RE

00:46:19.843 --> 00:46:22.179
PICKING UP MORE HOURS OF WORK TO

CALIFORNIA POLICY LAB. MANY

00:46:32.156 --> 00:46:33.090
STUDENTS DON'T KNOW THEY

00:46:33.157 --> 00:46:35.626

00:46:35.692 --> 00:46:37.094
COMPLEX PAPERWORK OR CONFUSION

00:46:37.161 --> 00:46:38.795
ABOUT WHETHER THEY'RE ELIGIBLE.

00:46:38.862 --> 00:46:40.230
AND THIS BILL IS A SMART, SIMPLE

00:46:40.297 --> 00:46:41.865
WAY TO REMOVE BARRIERS AND HELP

00:46:41.932 --> 00:46:44.301

00:46:44.368 --> 00:46:47.538

CONNECTED TO HELP WITH APPLYING

00:46:51.942 --> 00:46:53.710
FOR FOOD BENEFITS. IT

00:46:53.777 --> 00:46:55.012
FACILITATES COORDINATION ACROSS

00:46:55.078 --> 00:46:56.480
STATE AND COUNTY SYSTEMS, MAKING

00:46:56.547 --> 00:46:58.482

GRADUATE STUDENT AT UCLA.

00:47:38.722 --> 00:47:40.190
MEETING AND PRIORITIZING THE

00:47:40.257 --> 00:47:42.259
COST OF LIVING AS A STUDENT IS

00:47:42.326 --> 00:47:44.027
CHALLENGING. I RECEIVED LITTLE

00:47:44.094 --> 00:47:46.196
GUIDANCE DURING MY CAL FRESH

00:47:46.263 --> 00:47:46.964

ALTHOUGH UCLA PROVIDES GUIDANCE

00:47:53.503 --> 00:47:54.471
FOR STUDENTS TO SUPPORT

00:47:54.538 --> 00:47:55.672
ENROLLMENT THROUGH ITS BASIC

00:47:55.739 --> 00:47:57.975
NEEDS OFFICE, A DIRECT LINKAGE

00:47:58.041 --> 00:47:59.543
OR OUTREACH WOULD HAVE MADE IT

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:02.145
THE PROCESS A LOT EASIER.

00:48:02.212 --> 00:48:03.947
STUDENTS WHO ALSO HAVE TO FACE

00:48:04.014 --> 00:48:06.350
THE STIGMA OF CALFRESH

00:48:06.416 --> 00:48:07.618
ENROLLMENT, AND MANY DON'T

00:48:07.684 --> 00:48:08.852
BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE WORTHY OF

00:48:08.919 --> 00:48:09.953
THE BENEFIT, SOMETHING THAT

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:11.755
CERTAINLY HAS A NEGATIVE

00:48:11.822 --> 00:48:13.890
CONSEQUENCE ON STUDENTS HEALTH.

00:48:13.957 --> 00:48:16.159
SEEING OTHER PEERS ENROLL IN

00:48:16.226 --> 00:48:17.127
CALFRESH IN THE BEGINNING OF MY

00:48:17.194 --> 00:48:18.929
DEGREE PROGRAM CREATED A WAVE OF

00:48:18.996 --> 00:48:20.564
SECURITY AND ASSURANCE THAT WE

00:48:20.631 --> 00:48:22.132
ARE WORTHY OF RECEIVING THESE

00:48:22.199 --> 00:48:23.934
BENEFITS. CAL FRESH HAS

00:48:24.001 --> 00:48:25.469
POSITIVELY IMPACTED MY ABILITY

00:48:25.535 --> 00:48:26.770

BENEFICIAL RELATIONSHIP. I AM

00:48:57.534 --> 00:48:58.935
GRATEFUL THAT MY DEGREE PROGRAM

00:48:59.002 --> 00:49:02.272

00:49:02.339 --> 00:49:04.007
OVER 15 PROGRAMS THAT

00:49:04.074 --> 00:49:05.409
UNFORTUNATELY AREN'T APPROVED,

00:49:05.475 --> 00:49:06.777

WELL. WHEN I WAS PLAYING

00:52:10.894 --> 00:52:12.362
FOOTBALL AT FRESNO STATE, I WAS

00:52:12.429 --> 00:52:14.798
A WALK ON THE FIRST TWO YEARS,

00:52:14.865 --> 00:52:17.534
AND THERE WAS A PERIOD WHERE I

00:52:17.601 --> 00:52:20.136
ACTUALLY ENDED UP HOMELESS AND

00:52:20.203 --> 00:52:22.439
IT WAS BETWEEN, YOU KNOW, MY

00:52:22.506 --> 00:52:24.140
FAMILY'S HOME GETTING RED TAGGED

00:52:24.207 --> 00:52:26.276
OR MYSELF HAVING INSECURITY ON

00:52:26.343 --> 00:52:28.078
FOOD. AND IN THAT PERIOD, THERE

00:52:28.144 --> 00:52:29.646
WAS A THREE WEEK PERIOD WHERE I

00:52:29.713 --> 00:52:32.749
HAD NOTHING TO EAT BUT MUSCLE

00:52:32.816 --> 00:52:37.020
MILK. AND THE STAFF ACTUALLY

00:52:37.087 --> 00:52:39.256
BROUGHT SOMEBODY IN TO GIVE A

00:52:39.322 --> 00:52:41.491
PRESENTATION TO THE ENTIRE TEAM

00:52:41.558 --> 00:52:42.726
TO LET THEM KNOW THAT THERE'S A

00:52:42.792 --> 00:52:45.128
LOT OF US THAT COULD QUALIFY FOR

00:52:45.195 --> 00:52:46.663
CALFRESH, AND THAT WAS ONE OF

00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:48.598
THE PERIODS THAT REALLY HELPED

00:52:48.665 --> 00:52:50.901
US, WAS WHEN OUR FOOTBALL TEAM

00:52:50.967 --> 00:52:52.802
ACTUALLY LOOKED AT THAT. A LOT

00:52:52.869 --> 00:52:54.004
OF US ACTUALLY CAME FROM

00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:54.838
DISADVANTAGED, LOW INCOME

00:52:54.905 --> 00:52:55.839

KNOW WHAT WAS ACTUALLY AVAILABLE

00:52:57.541 --> 00:52:58.708

MOREOVER, RESEARCH SHOWS THAT

00:58:34.143 --> 00:58:35.178
MIDWIFERY CARE IS ASSOCIATED

00:58:35.245 --> 00:58:37.947
WITH IMPROVED OUTCOMES AT LOWER

CHALLENGES IN BUILDING A STRONG

00:58:52.495 --> 00:58:54.297
MIDWIFERY WORKFORCE, PARTLY DUE

TO THE UPFRONT FINANCIAL

00:58:56.833 --> 00:58:58.034

WILL ALLOW THE COLLECTION OF

00:59:21.557 --> 00:59:23.393
BOTH STATE AND PRIVATE FUNDS TO

00:59:23.459 --> 00:59:24.894

EITHER AT A UC OR CAL STATE

00:59:30.667 --> 00:59:32.101
UNIVERSITY. FUNDS WOULD BE

00:59:32.168 --> 00:59:33.836
PRIORITIZED FOR PROGRAMS THAT

01:00:16.646 --> 01:00:18.414
METHOD OF FUNDING MIDWIFERY

01:00:18.481 --> 01:00:20.583

01:00:46.275 --> 01:00:47.343
CERTIFIED NURSE MIDWIVES WORKING

01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:49.479

01:00:51.714 --> 01:00:54.050

MASTER'S DEGREE NURSE MIDWIFERY

01:00:57.754 --> 01:00:59.889
PROGRAM WOULD BE MOST IMPACTFUL

01:00:59.956 --> 01:01:01.391
FOR COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE. LET

01:01:01.457 --> 01:01:03.426
ME TELL YOU WHY. WE KNOW FRESNO

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:05.962
COUNTY FACES SOME HIGH, HIGH

01:01:06.029 --> 01:01:08.898
PRETERM BIRTH RATES, INFANT AND

01:01:08.965 --> 01:01:10.433
MATERNAL MORTALITY RATES, WITH

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.402
THE MAJORITY OF THAT BURDEN ON

01:01:12.468 --> 01:01:14.904
OUR BLACK FAMILIES. I'M THE

01:01:14.971 --> 01:01:16.372
CLINICAL MANAGER AT THE BLACK

01:01:16.439 --> 01:01:17.907
WELLNESS AND PROSPERITY CENTER,

01:01:17.974 --> 01:01:20.543
AND WE ARE A NONPROFIT FOUNDED

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:22.879
IN 2019 BY SHANTI DAVIES BALCH,

01:01:22.945 --> 01:01:24.981
AND OUR WORK FOCUSES ON

01:01:25.048 --> 01:01:26.249
IMPROVING BLACK MATERNAL,

01:01:26.315 --> 01:01:27.984
INFANT, AND COMMUNITY HEALTH

01:01:28.051 --> 01:01:30.053
OUTCOMES THROUGH RELATIONSHIPS,

01:01:30.119 --> 01:01:31.120
INFRASTRUCTURE, BUILDING,

01:01:31.187 --> 01:01:33.322
RESEARCH AND ADVOCACY. AND OUR

01:01:33.389 --> 01:01:35.491
VISION REALLY HAS THREE SIMPLE

01:01:35.558 --> 01:01:37.994
LINES NO BLACK WOMAN WILL DIE

01:01:38.061 --> 01:01:39.762
FROM A PREVENTABLE CHILDBIRTH

01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:41.697
RELATED DEATH. NO BLACK WOMAN

01:01:41.764 --> 01:01:44.133
WILL DELIVER A PREVENTABLE

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:45.968
PREMATURE BIRTH, AND NO BLACK

01:01:46.035 --> 01:01:48.538
BABY WILL DIE FROM A PREVENTABLE

01:01:48.604 --> 01:01:51.340
CAUSE. AND WE SEE SB 520 AS A

01:01:51.407 --> 01:01:53.242
WAY FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD IN

01:01:53.309 --> 01:01:55.011
THIS VISION. I'M VERY AWARE OF

01:01:55.078 --> 01:01:57.113
THE DRASTIC NEED FOR ACCESS TO

01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:59.015
MIDWIVES AS OUR TEAM ENGAGES

01:01:59.082 --> 01:02:00.049
THROUGH DIRECT SERVICES AND

01:02:00.116 --> 01:02:01.784
THROUGH EVENTS. YOU KNOW, WE

01:02:01.851 --> 01:02:03.553
HEAR DOULAS, STUDENTS EXPRESSING

01:02:03.619 --> 01:02:05.421
THE DESIRE TO GO TO SCHOOL AND

01:02:05.488 --> 01:02:07.523
BECOME A MIDWIFE, BUT DON'T HAVE

01:02:07.590 --> 01:02:09.292
THE TRAINING RESOURCES AVAILABLE

01:02:09.358 --> 01:02:11.194
TO STAY IN THEIR COMMUNITY. OUR

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:12.562
ENDS AND NURSE PRACTITIONERS ARE

01:02:12.628 --> 01:02:13.996
EVEN OFTEN EXPRESSING

01:02:14.063 --> 01:02:15.098
FRUSTRATION WITH THE LIMITED

01:02:15.164 --> 01:02:16.499
ACCESS TO NURSE MIDWIFERY

01:02:16.566 --> 01:02:17.667
PROGRAMS. AND WE HEAR OUR

01:02:17.733 --> 01:02:19.669
PARTNER HOSPITALS AND

01:02:19.735 --> 01:02:21.237
INSTITUTIONS LOOKING AND LOOKING

01:02:21.304 --> 01:02:24.040
FOR MORE MIDWIVES TO HIRE. BUT

01:02:24.107 --> 01:02:27.243
FINDING FEW. SO THE KIND OF CARE

01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:29.078
THAT MIDWIVES PROVIDE, YOU KNOW,

01:02:29.145 --> 01:02:32.715
IS QUITE UNIQUE. IT'S HOLISTIC,

01:02:32.782 --> 01:02:34.817
INDIVIDUALIZED, EMPOWERING CARE.

01:02:34.884 --> 01:02:36.586
AND IT IS A SACRED PROFESSION

01:02:36.652 --> 01:02:37.887
I'M HONORED TO BE A PART OF, YOU

01:02:37.954 --> 01:02:39.555
KNOW, FROM THE BRAVE HEBREW

01:02:39.622 --> 01:02:41.424
MIDWIVES IN SCRIPTURE TALKED

01:02:41.491 --> 01:02:43.459
ABOUT AND THEN ALSO THROUGH THE

01:02:43.526 --> 01:02:45.261
GRAND MIDWIVES AND THE SOUTH

01:02:45.328 --> 01:02:47.797
DURING SLAVERY AND SEGREGATION.

01:02:47.864 --> 01:02:50.433
WE HAVE A HISTORY OF SERVING OUR

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:51.834
COMMUNITIES AND ADVOCATING FOR

01:02:51.901 --> 01:02:53.970
THEM. SUPPORT FROM THIS BILL

01:02:54.036 --> 01:02:55.371
EXTENDS THROUGHOUT OUR

01:02:55.438 --> 01:02:56.806
COMMUNITY. COUNTY AND LOCAL

01:02:56.873 --> 01:02:58.374
OFFICIALS RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR

01:02:58.441 --> 01:03:00.409
NURSE MIDWIVES, INCLUDING FRESNO

01:03:00.476 --> 01:03:02.979
COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISOR, WHO

01:03:03.045 --> 01:03:04.780
SUBMITTED A LETTER RECENTLY IN

01:03:04.847 --> 01:03:07.550
MAY OF SUPPORT. WE ARE A

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:09.619
DESIGNATED AREA OF NEED, AND WE

01:03:09.685 --> 01:03:11.654
ARE IN A MATERNAL HEALTH CRISIS

01:03:11.721 --> 01:03:13.756
AND THE INTEGRATION OF NURSE

01:03:13.823 --> 01:03:15.625
MIDWIVES INTO OUR HEALTH SYSTEMS

01:03:15.691 --> 01:03:17.527
IS A CRITICAL PART OF THE

01:03:17.593 --> 01:03:19.328
SOLUTION. SO I BELIEVE FRESNO,

01:03:19.395 --> 01:03:21.497
THE CENTRAL VALLEY, CALIFORNIA

01:03:21.564 --> 01:03:23.199
IS WORTHY OF THIS INVESTMENT FOR

01:03:23.266 --> 01:03:25.601
A STRONG MIDWIFERY WORKFORCE.

01:03:25.668 --> 01:03:27.737
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND

01:03:27.803 --> 01:03:29.672
CONSIDERATION TODAY. THANK YOU

01:03:29.739 --> 01:03:31.407
SO MUCH. OTHER WITNESSES IN

01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:34.377
SUPPORT IN THE HEARING ROOM,

01:03:34.443 --> 01:03:35.778
REBECCA GONZALEZ WITH THE

01:03:35.845 --> 01:03:36.879
WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND

01:03:36.946 --> 01:03:38.581
POVERTY AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU.

01:03:38.648 --> 01:03:39.749
ARE THERE WITNESSES IN

01:03:39.815 --> 01:03:40.883
OPPOSITION IN THE HEARING ROOM?

01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:42.451
ARE THERE TWEENERS IN THE

01:03:42.518 --> 01:03:44.487
HEARING ROOM? COLLEAGUES, ANY

01:03:44.554 --> 01:03:46.222
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS? VICE

01:03:46.289 --> 01:03:49.859
CHAIR TAMAYO. THANK YOU. AND I'M

01:03:49.926 --> 01:03:51.561
INCLINED TO SUPPORT THE OVERALL

01:03:51.627 --> 01:03:53.763
CONCEPT OF THIS PROGRAM. BUT IN

01:03:53.829 --> 01:03:55.464
READING THE LEGISLATION, THERE'S

01:03:55.531 --> 01:04:00.336
REFERENCE TO BIRTHING PEOPLE. WE

01:04:00.403 --> 01:04:04.207
MEAN MOTHERS. SO BIRTHING PEOPLE

01:04:04.273 --> 01:04:06.676
IS AN INCLUSIVE TERM THAT

01:04:06.742 --> 01:04:10.112
INCLUDES PEOPLE WITH UTERUSES

01:04:10.179 --> 01:04:12.481
WHO ARE GIVING BIRTH WITHOUT

01:04:12.548 --> 01:04:14.917
GENDER DEFINITION, BECAUSE THERE

01:04:14.984 --> 01:04:16.552
ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO USE THEY

01:04:16.619 --> 01:04:19.255
THEM PRONOUNS AND OTHERS. BUT

01:04:19.322 --> 01:04:22.491
YES, GENERALLY SPEAKING, IT DOES

01:04:22.558 --> 01:04:25.695
REFER TO MOTHERS. I MEAN, YOU

01:04:25.761 --> 01:04:26.729
HAD ME AT THE PROGRAM AND THEN

01:04:26.796 --> 01:04:30.900
WE HAD TO ENGAGE IN, IN WHAT I

01:04:30.967 --> 01:04:33.703
THINK IS LANGUAGE THAT

01:04:33.769 --> 01:04:35.538
MARGINALIZES WOMEN. I

01:04:35.605 --> 01:04:36.572
RESPECTFULLY, AS A WOMAN WHO

01:04:36.639 --> 01:04:39.275
CARES FOR WOMEN, I WOULD I WOULD

01:04:39.342 --> 01:04:40.810
HOPE THAT WE COULD MOVE FORWARD

01:04:40.876 --> 01:04:43.145
WITH SAVING LIVES WITHOUT BEING

01:04:43.212 --> 01:04:45.648
CAUGHT UP IN IDENTITY POLITICS.

01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:46.983
I WOULD LOVE NOT TO GET CAUGHT

01:04:47.049 --> 01:04:48.417
UP IN IDENTITY POLITICS, WHICH

01:04:48.484 --> 01:04:50.586
IS WHY I THINK YOU HAVE A GOOD

01:04:50.653 --> 01:04:52.054
IDEA HERE THAT YOU DISTRACT FROM

01:04:52.121 --> 01:04:54.190
BY PUTTING IN POLITICIZED

01:04:54.257 --> 01:04:55.791
LANGUAGE. AND MY HOPE IS THAT

01:04:55.858 --> 01:04:57.793
YOU MIGHT CONSIDER AN AMENDMENT

01:04:57.860 --> 01:04:59.595
GOING FORWARD, BECAUSE I THINK

01:04:59.662 --> 01:05:02.732
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE

01:05:02.798 --> 01:05:05.701
SHOULD BE EXCITED TO SUPPORT,

01:05:05.768 --> 01:05:06.769
PARTICULARLY IN THE

01:05:06.836 --> 01:05:08.237
IMPLEMENTATION, AND TO ASK

01:05:08.304 --> 01:05:10.606
PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR A BILL THAT

01:05:10.673 --> 01:05:14.310
CONTAINS SOMETHING THAT IS

01:05:14.377 --> 01:05:19.315
OFFENSIVE TO MANY. AND DIVISIVE

01:05:19.382 --> 01:05:22.551
TO MANY, JUST DISTRACTS FROM THE

01:05:22.618 --> 01:05:24.553
GOOD IDEA. SO LET'S NOT PLAY

01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:25.655
POLITICS ON A GOOD IDEA. LET'S

01:05:25.721 --> 01:05:27.757
JUST GET THE GOOD IDEA DONE, AND

01:05:27.823 --> 01:05:29.425
I WOULD URGE YOU TO AT LEAST

01:05:29.492 --> 01:05:31.227
WEIGH AS THE PROCESS MOVES

01:05:31.294 --> 01:05:32.061
FORWARD, AN AMENDMENT TO THAT

01:05:32.128 --> 01:05:35.798
LANGUAGE. THANK YOU. SENATOR

01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:44.507
COUNTY, WE HAVE THE BORDER OF

01:05:44.573 --> 01:05:47.843
MEXICO. AND THEN MY DISTRICT HAS

01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:50.046
THE BORDER OF MEXICO, ARIZONA.

01:05:50.112 --> 01:05:53.783
NEVADA SPANS ROUGHLY THE SIZE OF

01:05:53.849 --> 01:05:55.718
A LITTLE BIT BIGGER THAN NEW

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:56.819
HAMPSHIRE. THERE'S A LOT OF

01:05:56.886 --> 01:06:00.122
PEOPLE IN A LITTLE TOWN RIGHT

01:06:00.189 --> 01:06:03.759
OFF THE BORDER CALLED CALEXICO.

01:06:03.826 --> 01:06:06.562
WHEN A WOMAN GIVES BIRTH, WAS

01:06:06.629 --> 01:06:09.699
READY TO GIVE BIRTH, SHE'S GOT

01:06:09.765 --> 01:06:11.300
TO TRAVEL SOMETIME, EITHER

01:06:11.367 --> 01:06:13.769
ACROSS THE INTERNATIONAL BORDER

01:06:13.836 --> 01:06:16.372
OR SHE'S GOT TO TRAVEL 45

01:06:16.439 --> 01:06:18.908
MINUTES TO THE PAST. THE

01:06:18.974 --> 01:06:20.576
HOSPITAL THAT'S CLOSED, THEIR

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:23.412
OBGYN DEPARTMENT OR THE BIRTHING

01:06:23.479 --> 01:06:25.214
CENTER TO THE NEXT HOSPITAL THAT

01:06:25.281 --> 01:06:29.151
HAS IT. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY

01:06:29.218 --> 01:06:31.020
CRITICAL TO MY DISTRICT,

01:06:31.087 --> 01:06:32.421
ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO MY

01:06:32.488 --> 01:06:34.924
DISTRICT, THAT WE CAN HAVE THIS

01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:39.328
TYPE OF FLEXIBILITY IN OUR

01:06:39.395 --> 01:06:41.497
EDUCATION SO THAT WE CAN ANSWER

01:06:41.564 --> 01:06:43.532
THE GAP, THE NEED. RIGHT. WE

01:06:43.599 --> 01:06:46.202
HAVE A NEED IN IMPERIAL COUNTY.

01:06:46.268 --> 01:06:47.570
WE HAVE A NEED THROUGHOUT

01:06:47.636 --> 01:06:50.439
CALIFORNIA, FRANKLY. AND THIS

01:06:50.506 --> 01:06:53.442
BILL ANSWERS THAT. I LOOK

01:06:53.509 --> 01:06:54.844
FORWARD TO SEEING THE

01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:56.245
IMPLEMENTATION IMPLEMENTATION OF

01:06:56.312 --> 01:06:59.749
THIS. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE

01:06:59.815 --> 01:07:03.486
FUNDING OF THIS. AND I'M NOT A

01:07:03.552 --> 01:07:07.056
FAN OF USING A WHOLE BUNCH OF

01:07:07.123 --> 01:07:07.723
MONEY FOR THROWING A WHOLE BUNCH

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:09.859
OF MONEY FOR A WHOLE BUNCH OF

01:07:09.925 --> 01:07:11.460
THINGS, BUT THIS IS ACTUALLY

01:07:11.527 --> 01:07:12.762
SOMETHING THAT'S CRITICAL TO THE

01:07:12.828 --> 01:07:14.063
LIFE AND DEATH OF THE MOTHER AND

01:07:14.130 --> 01:07:17.066
THE BABY IN HER WOMB AS SHE'S IN

01:07:17.133 --> 01:07:19.535
LABOR. SO TO HAVE PEOPLE THAT

01:07:19.602 --> 01:07:23.906
ARE TRAINED IN THIS WOULD BE A

01:07:23.973 --> 01:07:26.175
GODSEND TO MY DISTRICT. SO THANK

01:07:26.242 --> 01:07:28.277
YOU FOR THIS. I APPRECIATE YOUR

01:07:28.344 --> 01:07:30.846
YOUR THOUGHTFULNESS IN THIS, AND

01:07:30.913 --> 01:07:33.349
I HOPE WE CAN GET IT OVER IN MY

01:07:33.416 --> 01:07:34.683
DISTRICT WHERE WE HAVE CAL

01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:37.186
STATE, SAN BERNARDINO AND SAN

01:07:37.253 --> 01:07:39.088

THROUGHOUT MY DISTRICT AND GET

01:07:42.458 --> 01:07:44.560
SOME STUDENTS IN THERE. THANK

01:07:44.627 --> 01:07:46.395

VERY MUCH. I APPRECIATE YOUR

01:07:49.665 --> 01:07:52.168
COMMENTS. AND ALSO THE I WORKED

01:07:52.234 --> 01:07:54.170
ON THE DISTRESSED HOSPITAL LOAN

01:07:54.236 --> 01:07:57.807
PROGRAM FOR OUR HOSPITAL IN

01:07:57.873 --> 01:08:00.676
MADERA. BUT I KNOW THAT IN YOUR

01:08:00.743 --> 01:08:02.445
DISTRICT YOU HAD THIS SIMILAR

01:08:02.511 --> 01:08:06.115
SITUATION AND BOTH OF THEM HAD

01:08:06.182 --> 01:08:08.584
TO GIVE UP THEIR LABOR AND

01:08:08.651 --> 01:08:11.887
DELIVERY UNITS IN ORDER TO

01:08:11.954 --> 01:08:12.955
ECONOMICALLY SURVIVE. AND WHEN

01:08:13.022 --> 01:08:18.227
WE HAVE GIVEN UP ON. TAKING CARE

01:08:18.294 --> 01:08:24.066
OF. THE PREGNANCY AND THE CHILD

01:08:24.133 --> 01:08:26.702
THAT RESULTS FROM IT IN OUR

01:08:26.769 --> 01:08:29.138
COMMUNITY, IT'S ATROCIOUS. SO

01:08:29.205 --> 01:08:30.906
THANK YOU FOR THOSE THOSE

01:08:30.973 --> 01:08:33.075
COMMENTS. LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING

01:08:33.142 --> 01:08:34.710
THIS GET THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE

01:08:34.777 --> 01:08:36.545
AND SIGNED. WE NEED IT SIGNED

01:08:36.612 --> 01:08:37.880
AND THEN FUNDED. THANK YOU.

01:08:37.947 --> 01:08:41.750
THANK YOU SO MUCH. YEAH. TO JUST

01:08:41.817 --> 01:08:43.419
SENATOR AND I HAVE OVERLAP. WE

01:08:43.486 --> 01:08:45.654
BOTH GET TO HONOR AND PRIVILEGE

01:08:45.721 --> 01:08:47.790
OF REPRESENTING MADERA COUNTY.

01:08:47.857 --> 01:08:48.991
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT I OFTEN

01:08:49.058 --> 01:08:50.826
TALK ABOUT THAT THERE IS A

01:08:50.893 --> 01:08:52.495
COUNTY IN THE STATE OF

01:08:52.561 --> 01:08:54.029
CALIFORNIA THAT YOU CANNOT HAVE

01:08:54.096 --> 01:08:55.898
A BABY IN, BECAUSE THERE'S JUST

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:57.733
NOWHERE TO DO IT. AND I THINK

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.001
THAT SHOULD SHOCK A LOT OF

01:08:59.068 --> 01:09:01.136
PEOPLE. AND IT'S NOT THE ONLY

01:09:01.203 --> 01:09:03.038
ONE. THERE ARE MANY, YOU KNOW,

01:09:03.105 --> 01:09:04.673
AND THERE'S A LOT OF AREAS THAT

01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:06.141
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE

01:09:06.208 --> 01:09:07.776
NEED TO ADDRESS HERE AS A

01:09:07.843 --> 01:09:09.011
LEGISLATIVE BODY, I THINK THIS

01:09:09.078 --> 01:09:11.046
HELPS PREPARE FOR WHERE WE NEED

01:09:11.113 --> 01:09:13.382
TO GO IN THE FUTURE. AND I WANT

01:09:13.449 --> 01:09:15.117
TO ASK BEFORE WE GO DOWN THERE

01:09:15.184 --> 01:09:18.387
IS HOPEFULLY FRESNO STATE AGAIN

01:09:18.454 --> 01:09:19.889
CAN PICK UP THIS PROGRAM. I

01:09:19.955 --> 01:09:21.624
THINK THERE'S A LITTLE BIAS THAT

01:09:21.690 --> 01:09:23.592
I HAVE. FRESNO STATE, I'M GLAD

01:09:23.659 --> 01:09:25.327
YOU I'M GLAD YOU SAID IT BECAUSE

01:09:25.394 --> 01:09:26.862
IT RELIEVED ME OF THAT

01:09:26.929 --> 01:09:28.531
NECESSITY. BUT I THINK THAT'S

01:09:28.597 --> 01:09:29.632
SOMETHING I EVEN REMEMBER, TOO,

01:09:29.698 --> 01:09:31.800
WHEN I WAS HELPING OUT THE

01:09:31.867 --> 01:09:33.269
SCHOOL THERE IN THE NURSING

01:09:33.335 --> 01:09:34.003
PROGRAM. I MEAN, THEY ONLY HAVE

01:09:34.069 --> 01:09:35.371
65 AVAILABLE SLOTS BECAUSE

01:09:35.437 --> 01:09:36.906
THAT'S HOW MUCH THE STUDENTS CAN

01:09:36.972 --> 01:09:38.908
HOLD. BUT THERE WAS A PROGRAM I

01:09:38.974 --> 01:09:41.510
WAS ABLE TO REVIEW. THEY HAD 213

01:09:41.577 --> 01:09:43.212
4.0 STUDENTS THAT APPLIED FOR

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:44.813
THAT PROGRAM THAT, BUT THEY

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:47.983
COULDN'T ACCEPT ALL 214 213. BUT

01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:51.387
THAT DOESN'T EVEN COUNT THE, YOU

01:09:51.453 --> 01:09:54.089
KNOW, 300 PLUS 3.8 STUDENTS, THE

01:09:54.156 --> 01:09:56.525
300 PLUS, YOU KNOW, 3.5 STUDENTS

01:09:56.592 --> 01:09:57.660
AND ALL THE OTHER ONES THAT

01:09:57.726 --> 01:09:59.328
HOPEFULLY THIS GIVES US EVEN

01:09:59.395 --> 01:10:01.530
MORE OF AN OPTION TO HAVE, YOU

01:10:01.597 --> 01:10:02.798
KNOW, TO TRULY SOLVE THE ISSUES

01:10:02.865 --> 01:10:05.601
THAT WE'RE SEEING WITH MADERA

01:10:05.668 --> 01:10:06.168
COMMUNITY. FOR A LOT OF THE

01:10:06.235 --> 01:10:07.469
OTHER HOSPITALS IN THE CENTRAL

01:10:07.536 --> 01:10:08.904

POSITION ON ALWAYS PRIORITIZING

01:10:12.841 --> 01:10:14.009
THE VALLEY, AND ESPECIALLY IN AN

01:10:14.076 --> 01:10:16.478
AREA THAT IS SPECIFICALLY, YOU

01:10:16.545 --> 01:10:17.880

ROBUST DISCUSSION. WE ARE A

01:10:30.893 --> 01:10:32.928
FIRST WORLD COUNTRY, BUT WE HAVE

01:10:32.995 --> 01:10:36.632
THIRD WORLD ISSUES AS IT RELATES

01:10:36.699 --> 01:10:38.367

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:42.938
CRITICAL ISSUE AND I

VERY IMPORTANT LEGISLATION

FORWARD. MASTER'S LEVEL

01:10:49.578 --> 01:10:50.646
MIDWIFERY PROGRAMS WILL HELP

01:10:50.713 --> 01:10:52.381
FILL CRITICAL HEALTH GAPS,

01:10:52.448 --> 01:10:54.183
ESPECIALLY HERE IN OUR RURAL

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:55.851
AREAS IN CALIFORNIA. AND TO FUND

01:10:55.918 --> 01:10:57.486
THE FUND THAT THIS BILL WOULD

01:10:57.553 --> 01:10:59.021
ESTABLISH WILL GO A LONG WAY

01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:00.155
TOWARDS INCENTIVIZING THE

01:11:00.222 --> 01:11:01.457
CREATION OF ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS

01:11:01.523 --> 01:11:02.992
IN OUR STATE. AND I LOOK FORWARD

01:11:03.058 --> 01:11:05.160

ALL RIGHT WELCOME TO YOUR

01:11:27.683 --> 01:11:28.817
FAVORITE BILL OF THE YEAR. YEAH.

01:11:28.884 --> 01:11:31.587
SO IF YOU'VE EVER THOUGHT ABOUT

01:11:31.654 --> 01:11:34.289
THE MAJOR GAP BETWEEN HIGH

01:11:34.356 --> 01:11:36.025
SCHOOL AND COLLEGE, WE OFTEN

01:11:36.091 --> 01:11:37.826
THINK ABOUT IT HERE IN THIS IN

01:11:37.893 --> 01:11:39.828
YOUR COMMITTEE AND IN THE STATE

01:11:39.895 --> 01:11:41.363
OF CALIFORNIA, HOW MANY STUDENTS

01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:42.765
THAT ARE FULLY QUALIFIED DON'T

01:11:42.831 --> 01:11:45.300
GO ON TO COLLEGE OR TO

01:11:45.367 --> 01:11:47.503
UNIVERSITY, GIVEN THE NEED THAT

01:11:47.569 --> 01:11:50.339
THE STATE HAS AND ALSO THE

01:11:50.406 --> 01:11:51.106
POWERFUL ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY

01:11:51.173 --> 01:11:53.308
THAT IS UNLOCKED WHEN YOU DO.

01:11:53.375 --> 01:11:54.977
AND SO WE'VE HAD LOTS OF

01:11:55.044 --> 01:11:56.178
POLICIES AND PROGRAMS TRYING TO

01:11:56.245 --> 01:11:57.946
FIX THAT. BUT WHEN YOU TAKE A

01:11:58.013 --> 01:11:59.348
STEP BACK, YOU WONDER, WELL,

01:11:59.415 --> 01:12:00.816
WHERE DOES THIS GAP COME FROM IN

01:12:00.883 --> 01:12:04.086
THE FIRST PLACE? IT'S THE, THE

01:12:04.153 --> 01:12:06.055
WHOLE PROCESS OF GOING TO

01:12:06.121 --> 01:12:07.623
COLLEGE AND APPLYING FOR IT,

01:12:07.690 --> 01:12:09.158
HOPING, WAITING FOR FINANCIAL

01:12:09.224 --> 01:12:11.927
AID. IT'S NOT IN THE PHYSICS

01:12:11.994 --> 01:12:13.162
TEXTBOOK. IT'S NOT IN THE BIBLE.

01:12:13.228 --> 01:12:14.830
IT'S NOT IN THE CONSTITUTION.

01:12:14.897 --> 01:12:16.899
IT'S ENTIRELY AN INVENTION OF

01:12:16.965 --> 01:12:19.401
US. THE GAP BETWEEN 12TH GRADE

01:12:19.468 --> 01:12:21.236
AND COLLEGE. AND IT DOESN'T

01:12:21.303 --> 01:12:22.805
EXIST. THE GAP, THE SAME GAP

01:12:22.871 --> 01:12:23.806
DOES NOT EXIST BETWEEN

01:12:23.872 --> 01:12:25.240
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND JUNIOR

01:12:25.307 --> 01:12:27.209
HIGH OR JUNIOR HIGH AND HIGH

01:12:27.276 --> 01:12:28.977
SCHOOL. WE. WHILE YOU MIGHT

01:12:29.044 --> 01:12:30.312
CHOOSE A DIFFERENT SCHOOL,

01:12:30.379 --> 01:12:31.880
YOU'RE GUARANTEED. AND WHEN YOU

01:12:31.947 --> 01:12:33.148
FINISH SIXTH GRADE, YOU'RE GOING

01:12:33.215 --> 01:12:34.950
TO GET INTO SEVENTH GRADE. WE

01:12:35.017 --> 01:12:37.086
DON'T REQUIRE EVERYBODY TO HOLD

01:12:37.152 --> 01:12:38.921
THEIR BREATH, APPLY A YEAR IN

01:12:38.987 --> 01:12:41.523
ADVANCE AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS. IN

01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:42.825
CALIFORNIA, IT IS POSSIBLE FOR

01:12:42.891 --> 01:12:44.893
US TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY.

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:45.961
WHEN I WAS MAYOR OF THE CITY OF

01:12:46.028 --> 01:12:48.230
WEST SACRAMENTO SIX YEARS AGO,

01:12:48.297 --> 01:12:49.765
WE IMPLEMENTED THE FIRST IN THE

01:12:49.832 --> 01:12:51.366
ENTIRE COUNTRY OF ANY STATE OR

01:12:51.433 --> 01:12:52.968
ANY CITY, A PROCESS FOR

01:12:53.035 --> 01:12:55.137
AUTOMATICALLY ENROLLING EVERY

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:56.205
GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL,

01:12:56.271 --> 01:12:57.339
AUTOMATICALLY ADMITTING EVERY

01:12:57.406 --> 01:12:59.174
GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR TO

01:12:59.241 --> 01:13:02.077
OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN

01:13:02.144 --> 01:13:02.845
CONJUNCTION WITH THE SCHOOL

01:13:02.911 --> 01:13:04.413
DISTRICT AND THE LOCAL COLLEGE.

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:08.117
IT WAS ANALYZED AND INCLUDED IN

01:13:08.183 --> 01:13:10.319
A BOOK BY A COUPLE OF NOBEL

01:13:10.385 --> 01:13:11.286
LAUREATES. HARVARD CELEBRATED IT

01:13:11.353 --> 01:13:12.554
AS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL

01:13:12.621 --> 01:13:15.324
EQUITY POLICIES IN THE COUNTRY.

01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:17.159
A COUPLE YEARS LATER, CSU BEGAN

01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:19.995
A PILOT PROJECT TO AUTOMATICALLY

01:13:20.062 --> 01:13:22.164
ADMIT STUDENTS FROM RIVERSIDE

01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:23.665
COUNTY TO ITS DECLINING

01:13:23.732 --> 01:13:26.068
ENROLLMENT CAMPUSES. WE HAVE THE

01:13:26.135 --> 01:13:28.303
TOOLS TODAY IN ORDER TO DO THIS

01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:30.172
AT SCALE, AND I WANT TO

01:13:30.239 --> 01:13:31.140
PARTICULARLY ACKNOWLEDGE THE

01:13:31.206 --> 01:13:32.441
CHAIR AND ALSO STAFF OF THIS

01:13:32.508 --> 01:13:33.842
COMMITTEE THAT HAVE BEEN

01:13:33.909 --> 01:13:35.377
WORKING, BECAUSE ONE OF THE KEY

01:13:35.444 --> 01:13:38.247
PARTS OF THAT TOOL HAS BEEN THE

01:13:38.313 --> 01:13:38.881
COLLEGE TO CAREER DATA SYSTEM,

01:13:38.947 --> 01:13:39.548
THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE GUIDANCE

01:13:39.615 --> 01:13:40.549
INITIATIVE, AND OTHER TOOLS THAT

01:13:40.616 --> 01:13:42.484
MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO GET

01:13:42.551 --> 01:13:44.153
RID OF THE APPLICATION PROCESS.

01:13:44.219 --> 01:13:45.888
FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF

01:13:45.954 --> 01:13:48.423
GRADUATING CALIFORNIANS, BECAUSE

01:13:48.490 --> 01:13:50.025
CALIFORNIA GUARANTEES TO

01:13:50.092 --> 01:13:50.826
GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS

01:13:50.893 --> 01:13:52.461
THAT IF YOU'RE IN THE TOP ONE

01:13:52.528 --> 01:13:53.629
THIRD OF YOUR CLASS, YOU ARE

01:13:53.695 --> 01:13:56.965
ENTITLED TO GO TO THE TO THE

01:13:57.032 --> 01:13:57.599
CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. AND

01:13:57.666 --> 01:13:58.233
WE'VE OPERATIONALIZED THAT TOP

01:13:58.300 --> 01:13:59.601
ONE THIRD IN THE FORM OF THE

01:13:59.668 --> 01:14:00.836
WELL-KNOWN A-G COURSES AND THE

01:14:00.903 --> 01:14:02.437
GRADE POINT AVERAGE REQUIREMENT.

01:14:02.504 --> 01:14:06.008
SO WHAT SB 640 DOES IS IT IT

01:14:06.074 --> 01:14:08.610
BRINGS THAT HOME. IT SAYS THAT

01:14:08.677 --> 01:14:09.745
EVERY GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL

01:14:09.812 --> 01:14:11.013
SENIOR IN CALIFORNIA, IF THEIR

01:14:11.079 --> 01:14:12.681
SCHOOL PARTICIPATES IN THE

01:14:12.748 --> 01:14:13.582
CALIFORNIA GUIDANCE INITIATIVE,

01:14:13.649 --> 01:14:15.450
WHICH VIRTUALLY ALL OF THEM DO,

01:14:15.517 --> 01:14:17.920
THAT THEY WILL RECEIVE IF THEY

01:14:17.986 --> 01:14:20.155
ARE QUALIFIED, IF THEY MEET THE

01:14:20.222 --> 01:14:21.523
ELIGIBILITY STANDARDS FOR CSU,

01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:23.759
THEY WILL RECEIVE AN AUTOMATIC

01:14:23.826 --> 01:14:26.562
LETTER OF ADMISSION TO CSU,

01:14:26.628 --> 01:14:27.663
IDENTIFYING IN PARTICULAR THE

01:14:27.729 --> 01:14:29.998
CAMPUSES FOR WHICH THEY CAN JUST

01:14:30.065 --> 01:14:32.901
CLICK AND GO. AND CAMPUSES LIKE

01:14:32.968 --> 01:14:34.570
SONOMA STATE IN MY OWN DISTRICT,

01:14:34.636 --> 01:14:35.838
BUT MANY OTHERS AS WELL. AND IF

01:14:35.904 --> 01:14:38.574
THEY WISH TO, TO GO ON TO A

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:39.141
COMPETITIVE CAMPUS LIKE SAN

01:14:39.208 --> 01:14:40.809
DIEGO STATE, CAL POLY, THEY CAN

01:14:40.876 --> 01:14:43.011
TAKE THE NEXT STEP KNOWING THAT

01:14:43.078 --> 01:14:44.213
THEY ARE ALREADY INTO CSU. THIS

01:14:44.279 --> 01:14:46.515
IS A POWERFUL INITIATIVE BECAUSE

01:14:46.582 --> 01:14:48.283
THE BILL YOU KNOW, WE'VE

01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:49.751
DISCUSSED THIS A LOT. IT'S NOT

01:14:49.818 --> 01:14:50.919
AN EMAIL. IT'S NOT A TWEET. IT

01:14:50.986 --> 01:14:53.689
IS A HARD LETTER BECAUSE WE WANT

01:14:53.755 --> 01:14:54.790
STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO

01:14:54.857 --> 01:14:56.859
HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF GETTING

01:14:56.925 --> 01:14:58.727
THAT LETTER FROM THE COLLEGE

01:14:58.794 --> 01:15:00.095
THAT YOU OPEN UP. OR MAYBE

01:15:00.162 --> 01:15:00.729
GRANDMA'S VISITING THAT

01:15:00.796 --> 01:15:02.030
AFTERNOON, AND SHE OPENS THE

01:15:02.097 --> 01:15:05.000
LETTER AND SAYS TO YOU, OH, I'M

01:15:05.067 --> 01:15:06.501
SO PROUD OF YOU. I DIDN'T EVEN

01:15:06.568 --> 01:15:07.736
KNOW YOU WERE APPLYING TO THE

01:15:07.803 --> 01:15:09.037
UNIVERSITY. AND YOU THINK TO

01:15:09.104 --> 01:15:10.639
YOURSELF, I DIDN'T EITHER. BUT

01:15:10.706 --> 01:15:13.008
NOW YOU'RE GOING. NOW THE FAMILY

01:15:13.075 --> 01:15:14.943
IS ON BOARD. YOU ARE GOING.

01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:15.978
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO AVAIL YOURSELF

01:15:16.044 --> 01:15:17.746
OF OTHER STATE FINANCIAL AID

01:15:17.813 --> 01:15:19.281
PROGRAMS IN ORDER TO MAKE IT

01:15:19.348 --> 01:15:20.949
REAL. SO THIS IS POSSIBLE

01:15:21.016 --> 01:15:22.651
BECAUSE OF THOSE DATA SYSTEMS

01:15:22.718 --> 01:15:24.186
THAT STUDENTS CAN BE ADMITTED

01:15:24.253 --> 01:15:26.655
WITHOUT HAVING TO APPLY. I DO

01:15:26.722 --> 01:15:27.856
WANT TO NOTE THAT THE

01:15:27.923 --> 01:15:29.591
ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL

01:15:29.658 --> 01:15:30.692
ADMINISTRATORS TODAY DID

01:15:30.759 --> 01:15:32.928
WITHDRAW THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE

01:15:32.995 --> 01:15:34.062
BILL. THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT

01:15:34.129 --> 01:15:35.697
SCHOOL RESPONSIBILITIES. BUT IN

01:15:35.764 --> 01:15:36.732
IN THE LATEST VERSION OF THE

01:15:36.798 --> 01:15:38.600
BILL, THERE ARE NO

01:15:38.667 --> 01:15:40.035
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR SCHOOLS. IN

01:15:40.102 --> 01:15:42.537
AN EARLY VERSION. SCHOOLS WERE

01:15:42.604 --> 01:15:43.672
GOING TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS

01:15:43.739 --> 01:15:45.774
PROCESS. THEY DON'T NEED TO BE.

01:15:45.841 --> 01:15:47.442
WE HAVE THE DATA SYSTEMS TO MAKE

01:15:47.509 --> 01:15:48.043
THIS COMPLETELY AUTOMATIC. SO

01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:49.177
THE STUDENTS SIMPLY RECEIVE

01:15:49.244 --> 01:15:51.113
THEIR LETTER AND THEY CAN GO.

01:15:51.179 --> 01:15:52.147
THE COROLLARY BENEFIT IS THAT

01:15:52.214 --> 01:15:54.383
FOR THOSE CAMPUSES, THE HALF A

01:15:54.449 --> 01:15:56.518
DOZEN OR A DOZEN CSU CAMPUSES,

01:15:56.585 --> 01:15:57.986
WHICH ARE EXPERIENCING

01:15:58.053 --> 01:15:59.354
SIGNIFICANT DECLINING

01:15:59.421 --> 01:16:01.990
ENROLLMENT, WILL PROVIDE A NEW

01:16:02.057 --> 01:16:03.025
PIPELINE OF STUDENTS FROM

01:16:03.091 --> 01:16:04.526
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WHO WILL

01:16:04.593 --> 01:16:06.862
BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

01:16:06.929 --> 01:16:07.863
THOSE OPPORTUNITIES AND HELP TO

01:16:07.930 --> 01:16:09.197
SUSTAIN THOSE CAMPUSES INTO THE

01:16:09.264 --> 01:16:10.565
FUTURE. THEN FINALLY, AND I KNOW

01:16:10.632 --> 01:16:12.968
THAT THE TERM IS CONTROVERSIAL,

01:16:13.035 --> 01:16:13.869
BUT THE CONCEPT IS NOT REALLY

01:16:13.936 --> 01:16:14.870
THE UNDERMATCH ISSUE, THAT THERE

01:16:14.937 --> 01:16:17.072
ARE MANY STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA,

01:16:17.139 --> 01:16:18.540
PARTICULARLY BLACK AND BROWN

01:16:18.607 --> 01:16:21.310
STUDENTS, WHO DON'T APPLY TO THE

01:16:21.376 --> 01:16:22.778
TO THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF

01:16:22.844 --> 01:16:23.879
UNIVERSITY TO WHICH THEY ARE

01:16:23.946 --> 01:16:26.348
FULLY QUALIFIED FOR A LOT OF

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:27.516
REASONS, AND AS A RESULT,

01:16:27.582 --> 01:16:29.318
THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE

01:16:29.384 --> 01:16:31.853
LEVEL OF A DEGREE, THE ECONOMIC

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:33.155
IMPACT OF THAT DEGREE THAT THEY

01:16:33.221 --> 01:16:35.290
MIGHT THEY MIGHT THAT THEY ARE

01:16:35.357 --> 01:16:36.491
ENTITLED TO DO. SO. THIS BILL

01:16:36.558 --> 01:16:38.427
SOLVES FOR THAT BY BY MAKING

01:16:38.493 --> 01:16:39.428
SURE THAT THOSE STUDENTS ARE

01:16:39.494 --> 01:16:41.863
FULLY ADMITTED AND CAN GO TO THE

01:16:41.930 --> 01:16:42.898
UNIVERSITY AND PURSUE THEIR

01:16:42.965 --> 01:16:44.566
DREAMS. AND SO WITH THAT, I'D

01:16:44.633 --> 01:16:45.100
LIKE TO INTRODUCE DOCTOR

01:16:45.167 --> 01:16:46.935
CHRISTOPHER NELOM, WHO THE HEAD

01:16:47.002 --> 01:16:49.104
OF ADDRESS WEST AS OUR WITNESS

01:16:49.171 --> 01:16:50.605
IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

01:16:50.672 --> 01:16:52.607
GOOD AFTERNOON, CHAIR FONG AND

01:16:52.674 --> 01:16:53.775
ESTEEMED MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY

01:16:53.842 --> 01:16:55.944
HIGHER ED COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS

01:16:56.011 --> 01:16:57.012
DOCTOR CHRIS NELOM. I SERVE AS

01:16:57.079 --> 01:16:58.780
THE EDITOR OF EAST WEST. WE ARE

01:16:58.847 --> 01:17:00.682
A NONPROFIT ADVOCACY

01:17:00.749 --> 01:17:02.017
ORGANIZATION THAT'S BEEN IN

01:17:02.084 --> 01:17:03.785
CALIFORNIA FOR 25 YEARS, TRYING

01:17:03.852 --> 01:17:05.921
TO BOTH PROTECT AND IMPROVE THE

01:17:05.988 --> 01:17:07.789
PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM. WE

01:17:07.856 --> 01:17:09.191
BELIEVE WE CAN DO THAT BY

01:17:09.257 --> 01:17:10.726
ELIMINATING WHAT WE KNOW TO BE

01:17:10.792 --> 01:17:12.527
RACIAL AND ECONOMIC BARRIERS IN

01:17:12.594 --> 01:17:13.996
EMBEDDED IN THE SYSTEM. THAT

01:17:14.062 --> 01:17:16.465
BRINGS ME TO SB 640, WHICH DOES

01:17:16.531 --> 01:17:18.233
WHAT WE KNOW WORKS. IT'S NOT

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:20.769
JUST A GOOD IDEA, IT'S PROVEN A

01:17:20.836 --> 01:17:23.705
PROVEN STRATEGY THAT WORKS AND

01:17:23.772 --> 01:17:25.173
CAN HELP ADDRESS CRUCIAL NEEDS

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:27.175
IN OUR STATE TO HELP MORE LOW

01:17:27.242 --> 01:17:28.410
INCOME, MORE STUDENTS OF COLOR,

01:17:28.477 --> 01:17:30.212
MORE NATIVE STUDENTS, MORE

01:17:30.278 --> 01:17:31.947
CALIFORNIANS GO TO COLLEGE. IT

01:17:32.014 --> 01:17:33.648
CAN ALSO MAKE THE PATH TO

01:17:33.715 --> 01:17:35.183
COLLEGE SMOOTHER, WHICH WILL BE

01:17:35.250 --> 01:17:36.918
GOOD FOR STUDENTS AND FOR

01:17:36.985 --> 01:17:39.154
CALIFORNIA. IT CAN WORK TO HELP

01:17:39.221 --> 01:17:41.690
REDUCE ANXIETY THAT STUDENTS

01:17:41.757 --> 01:17:43.291
FACE AND CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE

01:17:43.358 --> 01:17:44.159
AND HELP THEM ACHIEVE THEIR

01:17:44.226 --> 01:17:46.795
COLLEGE DREAMS. ADDITIONALLY,

01:17:46.862 --> 01:17:48.463
INCREASED SUPPORT WITH THE

01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:49.664
ADMISSIONS PROCESS IS THE NEED

01:17:49.731 --> 01:17:51.433
WE, WE, AND OTHERS HAVE OUTLINED

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:53.502
IN OUR REPORTS THAT UNDER

01:17:53.568 --> 01:17:54.970
UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:17:55.037 --> 01:17:57.606
THIS BILL. IT CAN ALSO HELP WITH

01:17:57.672 --> 01:17:58.940
COLLEGE COSTS, WHICH WE KNOW ARE

01:17:59.007 --> 01:18:01.843
RISING. AND ONE OF THE REASONS

01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:03.678
THAT YOU ALL IN THIS, ON THIS

01:18:03.745 --> 01:18:05.080
BODY HERE INSTITUTED A UNIVERSAL

01:18:05.147 --> 01:18:06.882
FINANCIAL AID COMPLETION POLICY,

01:18:06.948 --> 01:18:08.316
WHICH HELPS IN THIS SIMILAR

01:18:08.383 --> 01:18:10.485
VEIN. SO WE KNOW THE APPLICATION

01:18:10.552 --> 01:18:12.587
PROCESS CAN BE CONFUSING AND

01:18:12.654 --> 01:18:14.456
CUMBERSOME. AND DESPITE HARD

01:18:14.523 --> 01:18:15.724
WORK, STUDENTS DOING EVERYTHING

01:18:15.791 --> 01:18:18.093
WE'VE ASKED THEM TO DO, SO MANY

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:20.128
STUDENTS REACH THIS POINT AND

01:18:20.195 --> 01:18:21.663
AREN'T ABLE TO GO TO COLLEGE

01:18:21.730 --> 01:18:22.864
BECAUSE THEY EITHER MISSED A

01:18:22.931 --> 01:18:24.266
MESSAGE OR DEADLINE THAT THEY

01:18:24.332 --> 01:18:27.702
OTHERWISE COULD HAVE OVERCOME.

01:18:27.769 --> 01:18:29.304
AND OUR MOST RECENT REPORT

01:18:29.371 --> 01:18:30.705
CALLED BLACK MINDS MATTER. WE

01:18:30.772 --> 01:18:33.241
SHARE A TREND LINE OF BLACK

01:18:33.308 --> 01:18:34.376
STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA WHICH

01:18:34.443 --> 01:18:35.710
SHOWS THAT FEWER STUDENTS IN

01:18:35.777 --> 01:18:36.845
THIS STATE, FEWER BLACK STUDENTS

01:18:36.912 --> 01:18:38.947
IN THIS STATE, ARE GOING TO

01:18:39.014 --> 01:18:40.382
COLLEGE THAN THEY WERE TEN YEARS

01:18:40.449 --> 01:18:42.050
AGO, A TREND THAT THIS BILL CAN

01:18:42.117 --> 01:18:45.053
HELP REVERSE. WE KNOW A COLLEGE

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:46.888
EDUCATION HELPS TO OPEN DOORS

01:18:46.955 --> 01:18:48.457
FOR STUDENTS. AND THAT MAY BE

01:18:48.523 --> 01:18:49.758
CLICHE, BUT IT'S TRUE. I KNOW

01:18:49.825 --> 01:18:52.094
THIS FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE. I'M

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:52.694
FROM BRAWLEY, CALIFORNIA, AND

01:18:52.761 --> 01:18:55.063
GOING TO COLLEGE CHANGED MY

01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:56.898
ENTIRE LIFE. RESEARCH ALSO SHOWS

01:18:56.965 --> 01:18:59.301
THAT STUDENTS WHO GO TO AND

01:18:59.367 --> 01:19:01.269
GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE EXTENDS

01:19:01.336 --> 01:19:03.338
BENEFITS TO THE STATE ECONOMIC

01:19:03.405 --> 01:19:04.873
BENEFITS, PUBLIC HEALTH

01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:06.341
BENEFITS, AND WORKFORCE

01:19:06.408 --> 01:19:08.443
BENEFITS. SO SB 640 IS NOT ONLY

01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:10.579
ABOUT IMPROVING EQUITABLE ACCESS

01:19:10.645 --> 01:19:11.947
TO HIGHER EDUCATION, BUT WE

01:19:12.013 --> 01:19:14.282
BELIEVE IT'S ABOUT STRENGTHENING

01:19:14.349 --> 01:19:16.017

SENATOR GONZALEZ, I'M SORRY.

01:22:33.448 --> 01:22:35.684
JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS.

01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:37.619
DID YOU SAY YOU'RE FROM BRAWLEY?

01:22:37.686 --> 01:22:41.156
I AM OH I'M SORRY. THANK YOU.

01:22:41.222 --> 01:22:42.891
WELL, SEEING THAT YOU'RE FROM MY

01:22:42.957 --> 01:22:46.528
DISTRICT. I HAVE A COUPLE JUST

01:22:46.594 --> 01:22:48.663
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS. SO THIS IS

01:22:48.730 --> 01:22:52.667
A 12TH GRADER THAT THEY GET THAT

01:22:52.734 --> 01:22:54.936
LETTER OR OR NOTIFICATION THAT

01:22:55.003 --> 01:22:57.305
THEY GET DIRECT ADMISSION INTO

01:22:57.372 --> 01:22:59.274
CSU BECAUSE OF THEIR WHATEVER

01:22:59.341 --> 01:23:01.242
THEIR TRANSCRIPTS KIND OF

01:23:01.309 --> 01:23:02.310
CATEGORIZE THEM IN. THAT'S

01:23:02.377 --> 01:23:05.547
CORRECT. CORRECT. OKAY. DO YOU

01:23:05.613 --> 01:23:08.616
FORESEE ANY. SO I'M LOOKING AT

01:23:08.683 --> 01:23:09.784
IT FROM A COUPLE DIFFERENT

01:23:09.851 --> 01:23:11.119
PERSPECTIVES. LIKE THE LIKE THE

01:23:11.186 --> 01:23:15.690
I, I IEP SIDE. RIGHT. INDIVIDUAL

01:23:15.757 --> 01:23:17.826
EDUCATION PLAN, THE SPECIAL

01:23:17.892 --> 01:23:19.527
NEEDS SIDE. HOW DOES THAT FIT

01:23:19.594 --> 01:23:22.163
INTO THIS. IN THIS PROCESS. HOW

01:23:22.230 --> 01:23:24.065
ARE WE HOW ARE WE LOOKING AT

01:23:24.132 --> 01:23:26.334
THAT. IS THAT EVEN A FACTOR OR

01:23:26.401 --> 01:23:28.603
DO WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT?

01:23:28.670 --> 01:23:31.239
I DON'T I DON'T KNOW IN TERMS OF

01:23:31.306 --> 01:23:35.176
HOW CSU IS EVALUATING OTHER THAN

01:23:35.243 --> 01:23:37.245
THE OTHER THAN THE TRADITIONAL

01:23:37.312 --> 01:23:38.513
TRANSCRIPT. IT DOES REQUIRE FOR

01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:40.915
THIS PROCESS TO WORK AND FOR IT

01:23:40.982 --> 01:23:41.983
TO BE NON FRICTION AND ALSO NOT

01:23:42.050 --> 01:23:43.952
INVOLVE ANY COSTS AT THE LOCAL

01:23:44.018 --> 01:23:45.587
LEVEL. IT HAS TO BE SORT OF

01:23:45.653 --> 01:23:47.288
ALGORITHMIC. IT'S NOT IT'S NOT

01:23:47.355 --> 01:23:47.889
BEING DONE BY AI OR ANYTHING,

01:23:47.956 --> 01:23:50.859
BUT IT HAS TO BE DONE BY THE BY

01:23:50.925 --> 01:23:51.726
THE FORMULA AUTOMATICALLY IN

01:23:51.793 --> 01:23:53.395
ORDER TO ISSUE THE LETTERS. AND

01:23:53.461 --> 01:23:54.796
SO IF THERE ARE ALTERNATIVE

01:23:54.863 --> 01:23:55.730
PATHWAYS, WHICH THERE ARE, THERE

01:23:55.797 --> 01:23:57.465
ARE ALSO STUDENTS THAT ARE IN

01:23:57.532 --> 01:23:58.099
DUAL ENROLLMENT AND WHAT HAVE

01:23:58.166 --> 01:24:00.735
YOU, WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE AS

01:24:00.802 --> 01:24:02.537
EASY TO DO AT THE FIRST STAGE.

01:24:02.604 --> 01:24:03.805
BUT I KNOW CSU HAS BEEN WORKING

01:24:03.872 --> 01:24:04.873
VERY THEY'RE THEY'VE BEEN VERY

01:24:04.939 --> 01:24:06.074
COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT

01:24:06.141 --> 01:24:07.876
THIS THIS THIS PROJECT IS

01:24:07.942 --> 01:24:08.977
INCLUSIVE AND STANDARDIZED. AND

01:24:09.043 --> 01:24:10.545
SO EVEN IF IT'S NOT COVERED AT

01:24:10.612 --> 01:24:12.046
THE OUTSET, I KNOW THEY'RE

01:24:12.113 --> 01:24:13.214
COMMITTED TO TRYING TO CONTINUE

01:24:13.281 --> 01:24:16.017
TO EXPAND IT TO COVER MORE AND

01:24:16.084 --> 01:24:16.818
MORE OF THESE MORE STANDARDIZED

01:24:16.885 --> 01:24:18.720
SITUATIONS. YEAH. YOU KNOW, WE

01:24:18.787 --> 01:24:21.189
TALK ABOUT EQUITY AND EVERYBODY

01:24:21.256 --> 01:24:23.057
AND HAVING A SPECIAL NEEDS SON

01:24:23.124 --> 01:24:24.993
THAT'S ALWAYS LIKE TOP OF MIND

01:24:25.059 --> 01:24:27.395
FOR ME. LIKE, HOW DOES MY SON OR

01:24:27.462 --> 01:24:28.463
THE SON OR DAUGHTER OF SOMEBODY

01:24:28.530 --> 01:24:30.965
IN CALIFORNIA WHO THIS PROGRAM

01:24:31.032 --> 01:24:33.501
IS GOING TO THEY'RE GOING TO

01:24:33.568 --> 01:24:34.936
PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM. HOW

01:24:35.003 --> 01:24:37.539
DO THEY BECOME A PART OF IT, OR

01:24:37.605 --> 01:24:40.008
HOW DO THEY OPT OUT? OR HOW DO

01:24:40.074 --> 01:24:41.376
THEY GET, YOU KNOW, SPECIAL HELP

01:24:41.443 --> 01:24:42.811
DOING IT? SO JUST SOMETHING THAT

01:24:42.877 --> 01:24:44.913
I'D ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER GOING

01:24:44.979 --> 01:24:46.514
FORWARD, I GET IT, YOU KNOW,

01:24:46.581 --> 01:24:48.883
IT'S A SMALLER SUBSET OF THE

01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:50.318
POPULATION, BUT IT IS A

01:24:50.385 --> 01:24:51.486
VULNERABLE PART OF THE

01:24:51.553 --> 01:24:53.688
POPULATION THAT WANTS TO GO TO

01:24:53.755 --> 01:24:54.923
COLLEGE, THAT WANTS TO EXCEL.

01:24:54.989 --> 01:24:56.925
AND IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT THEY

01:24:56.991 --> 01:24:58.426
THEY HAVE SOME SUPERPOWERS THAT

01:24:58.493 --> 01:25:00.228
DON'T DON'T ALLOW THAT OR DON'T

01:25:00.295 --> 01:25:02.197
ALIGN WITH IN THIS ALGORITHM.

01:25:02.263 --> 01:25:05.800
THE OTHER PIECE OF THIS IS IT'S

01:25:05.867 --> 01:25:08.436
JUST FOR THE CSU. WHAT ABOUT THE

01:25:08.503 --> 01:25:10.205
COMMUNITY COLLEGE SIDE OF

01:25:10.271 --> 01:25:12.006
THINGS? SO YES, IT IS. IT IS

01:25:12.073 --> 01:25:13.708
JUST THE CSU. THE PROJECT THAT

01:25:13.775 --> 01:25:15.643
WE LAUNCHED IN MY OWN CITY WAS

01:25:15.710 --> 01:25:17.812
WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE,

01:25:17.879 --> 01:25:19.914
WHICH IS MORE OF A PSYCHOLOGICAL

01:25:19.981 --> 01:25:21.916
NUDGE BECAUSE YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY

01:25:21.983 --> 01:25:23.318
IF YOU GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL

01:25:23.384 --> 01:25:25.787
OR YOU TURN 18, YOU ARE ALREADY

01:25:25.854 --> 01:25:26.754
LEGALLY ADMISSIBLE TO THE

01:25:26.821 --> 01:25:28.189
COMMUNITY COLLEGE UNIVERSALLY.

01:25:28.256 --> 01:25:29.958
SO YOU DON'T. THE POWER OF THE

01:25:30.024 --> 01:25:31.860
PROGRAM IS NOT AS STRONG. BUT

01:25:31.926 --> 01:25:33.561
THIS THIS PROJECT APPLIES

01:25:33.628 --> 01:25:37.232
SPECIFICALLY TO CSU. I STILL

01:25:37.298 --> 01:25:38.700
CONTINUE TO BELIEVE, YOU KNOW,

01:25:38.766 --> 01:25:40.068
IN THE IN THE FUTURE OR

01:25:40.134 --> 01:25:41.169
ENTERPRISING DISTRICTS SHOULD DO

01:25:41.236 --> 01:25:42.604
EXACTLY WHAT WE DID, WHICH THEY

01:25:42.670 --> 01:25:44.706
CAN DO AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL. WE

01:25:44.772 --> 01:25:46.007
WERE A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT. BUT

01:25:46.074 --> 01:25:48.743
THE, THE THIS BILL ONLY APPLIES

01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:49.711
TO CSU AT THIS STAGE. IT ALSO

01:25:49.777 --> 01:25:53.047
DOES NOT APPLY TO, TO èC. THE

01:25:53.114 --> 01:25:55.049
CONCERN I HAVE IS IN RURAL

01:25:55.116 --> 01:25:58.086
AREAS. RALEIGH, THE CLOSEST

01:25:58.152 --> 01:26:00.221
THING WE HAVE IS SAN DIEGO STATE

01:26:00.288 --> 01:26:01.723
UNIVERSITY. RIGHT. BUT THEN WE

01:26:01.789 --> 01:26:04.225
LOOK AT PLACES LIKE NEEDLES,

01:26:04.292 --> 01:26:07.161
WHICH IS FARTHER AWAY, PLACES

01:26:07.228 --> 01:26:09.998
LIKE BLYTHE THERE. IT'S A QUITE

01:26:10.064 --> 01:26:12.066
A QUITE A WAYS TO GET TO THE

01:26:12.133 --> 01:26:16.838
NEAREST CSU OF ANY SORT. SO I

01:26:16.905 --> 01:26:18.606
WOULD ASK THAT AS YOU, AS THIS

01:26:18.673 --> 01:26:20.174
IS MOVING FORWARD, WE I DON'T

01:26:20.241 --> 01:26:21.843
KNOW IF IT'S ANOTHER BILL OR

01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:23.378
IT'S AN AMENDMENT TO THIS BILL

01:26:23.444 --> 01:26:24.579
OR HOW IT OR HOW WE DEVELOP

01:26:24.646 --> 01:26:27.282
THIS, BUT KEEPING RURAL COUNTIES

01:26:27.348 --> 01:26:29.050
IN MIND, THE ONES THAT JUST

01:26:29.117 --> 01:26:31.119
DON'T IT JUST DOESN'T IT'S NOT

01:26:31.185 --> 01:26:33.054
PRACTICAL TO GO DOWN THE ROAD

01:26:33.121 --> 01:26:36.257
PER SE, TO BE ABLE TO GO TO A

01:26:36.324 --> 01:26:38.393
CSU AND YOU KNOW, THEY CAN'T

01:26:38.459 --> 01:26:39.627
AFFORD GOING ANYWHERE ELSE.

01:26:39.694 --> 01:26:41.696
RIGHT. SO JUST SOME OTHER PIECES

01:26:41.763 --> 01:26:43.031
THAT I LOOK AT SPECIFICALLY FOR

01:26:43.097 --> 01:26:44.566
MY DISTRICT IS HOW ARE THEY

01:26:44.632 --> 01:26:46.301
GOING TO HOW DOES THAT WORK OUT?

01:26:46.367 --> 01:26:48.436
RIGHT? I LIKE THE CONCEPT. THE

01:26:48.503 --> 01:26:51.039
OTHER PIECE THAT I HAVE IS THERE

01:26:51.105 --> 01:26:54.943
IS A WHAT I WOULD I WOULD SAY A

01:26:55.009 --> 01:26:57.145
CULTURAL BRIDGE THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:26:57.211 --> 01:26:58.846
CROSSED WHEN IT COMES TO HIGHER

01:26:58.913 --> 01:26:59.914
EDUCATION, WHICH IS WHY I LOVE

01:26:59.981 --> 01:27:01.749
BEING ON THIS, ON THIS

01:27:01.816 --> 01:27:03.251
COMMITTEE. AND WHAT I MEAN BY

01:27:03.318 --> 01:27:04.986
CULTURAL IS, YOU KNOW, I'M

01:27:05.053 --> 01:27:06.854
GETTING READY TO GRADUATE IN. MY

01:27:06.921 --> 01:27:08.690
FAMILY IS WORKING AND

01:27:08.756 --> 01:27:10.158
EVERYBODY'S WORKING, AND WE HAVE

01:27:10.224 --> 01:27:11.893
TO PAY TO STAY WHERE WE'RE AT.

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:14.462
SO IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT EASIER

01:27:14.529 --> 01:27:16.264
FOR DAD TO SAY OR MOM TO SAY,

01:27:16.331 --> 01:27:18.366
HEY, WE NEED YOU TO WORK VERSUS

01:27:18.433 --> 01:27:19.567
GOING RIGHT. THAT'S A CHALLENGE

01:27:19.634 --> 01:27:21.836
THAT WE HAVE. SO I LIKE THE FACT

01:27:21.903 --> 01:27:23.371
THAT THIS IS AN IMMEDIATE

01:27:23.438 --> 01:27:24.806
PSYCHOLOGICAL, HEY, I'M ALREADY

01:27:24.872 --> 01:27:27.442
ACCEPTED, RIGHT? DUAL ENROLLMENT

01:27:27.508 --> 01:27:30.244
IS ALSO A PIECE OF THIS PUZZLE

01:27:30.311 --> 01:27:32.046
THAT PLAYS, I BELIEVE, A FACTOR

01:27:32.113 --> 01:27:34.582
IN THAT. SO MY QUESTION TO THAT

01:27:34.649 --> 01:27:38.586
IS. IN THE DUAL ENROLLMENT, WHEN

01:27:38.653 --> 01:27:40.722
YOU HAVE STUDENTS IN A DUAL

01:27:40.788 --> 01:27:42.523
ENROLLMENT SCENARIO, YOU KNOW,

01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:44.692
NINTH THROUGH 12TH, THEY TAKE

01:27:44.759 --> 01:27:46.427
CLASSES AND THEY'RE ALREADY

01:27:46.494 --> 01:27:48.630
MARRIED UP TO A SCHOOL. HOW HOW

01:27:48.696 --> 01:27:51.099
IS THAT GOING TO WORK WITH THIS

01:27:51.165 --> 01:27:53.368
PROGRAM OF ACCEPTANCE. AND NOW

01:27:53.434 --> 01:27:54.736
THEY ALSO HAVE COLLEGE CREDITS

01:27:54.802 --> 01:27:56.070
FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE. IS THERE A

01:27:56.137 --> 01:27:58.439
CONFLICT THERE? THERE'S NO

01:27:58.506 --> 01:28:00.375
CONFLICT. SO THE DUAL ENROLLMENT

01:28:00.441 --> 01:28:01.909
COURSES SHOULD GENERALLY BE

01:28:01.976 --> 01:28:04.412
CODED FOR BOTH INSTITUTIONS. AND

01:28:04.479 --> 01:28:06.714
SO THEY SHOULD BE CODED IN THE

01:28:06.781 --> 01:28:08.049
DATABASE THAT THE CSU WILL BE

01:28:08.116 --> 01:28:09.317
USING THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA

01:28:09.384 --> 01:28:10.652
GUIDANCE INITIATIVE. IN ORDER TO

01:28:10.718 --> 01:28:12.487
NOTE THAT THAT THAT YOU HAVE

01:28:12.553 --> 01:28:13.454
COMPLETED, YOU HAVE COMPLETED,

01:28:13.521 --> 01:28:15.289
OR YOU ARE ON TRACK TO COMPLETE

01:28:15.356 --> 01:28:16.224
THE FULL CURRICULUM WITH

01:28:16.290 --> 01:28:17.525
WHATEVER GRADE POINT AVERAGE

01:28:17.592 --> 01:28:18.760
THAT YOU HAVE, THAT WILL, THAT

01:28:18.826 --> 01:28:20.762
WILL SUIT, THAT WILL MEET THAT,

01:28:20.828 --> 01:28:22.130
THAT, THAT TEST. SO DUAL

01:28:22.196 --> 01:28:23.264
ENROLLMENT SHOULD NOT THAT THE

01:28:23.331 --> 01:28:25.700
PROCESS OF THEN TRANSCRIPTING TO

01:28:25.767 --> 01:28:27.135
THAT PARTICULAR UNIVERSITY

01:28:27.201 --> 01:28:28.202
CAMPUS, THE DUAL ENROLLMENT

01:28:28.269 --> 01:28:30.071
COURSES THAT YOU TAKE THAT WILL

01:28:30.138 --> 01:28:31.372
STILL THAT WILL BE ANOTHER STEP,

01:28:31.439 --> 01:28:32.473
JUST LIKE APPLYING FOR HOUSING

01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:33.775
AND EVERYTHING ELSE WILL ALSO BE

01:28:33.841 --> 01:28:34.709
AN ADDITIONAL STEP. BUT THE

01:28:34.776 --> 01:28:36.844
ACTUAL PROCESS OF THE ADMISSION

01:28:36.911 --> 01:28:38.746
OFFER WILL, CAN, CAN, WILL

01:28:38.813 --> 01:28:39.714
PROCEED REGARDLESS OF YOUR DUAL

01:28:39.781 --> 01:28:42.150
ENROLLMENT STATUS. OKAY. AND

01:28:42.216 --> 01:28:44.752
LASTLY, I WOULD SAY THAT THE

01:28:44.819 --> 01:28:46.187
MEASURE OF EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS

01:28:46.254 --> 01:28:49.457
PROGRAM IS THERE A SUNSET ON

01:28:49.524 --> 01:28:50.992
HERE? I DIDN'T SEE A SUNSET ON

01:28:51.059 --> 01:28:52.927
IT, BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I

01:28:52.994 --> 01:28:54.762
WOULD SAY IS THIS, THIS IS THIS

01:28:54.829 --> 01:28:56.397
IS SOMETHING I'M INCLINED TO

01:28:56.464 --> 01:28:58.433
SUPPORT, AND I WANT TO SUPPORT

01:28:58.499 --> 01:28:59.734
WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW AT THE END

01:28:59.801 --> 01:29:02.437
OF THIS, YOU KNOW, FIVE YEARS OR

01:29:02.503 --> 01:29:04.105
WHATEVER, IS TO BE ABLE TO SAY,

01:29:04.172 --> 01:29:06.374
MAN, THIS REALLY WORKED, OR WE

01:29:06.441 --> 01:29:07.775
NEED TO ADJUST THIS WORDING,

01:29:07.842 --> 01:29:09.577
THIS WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE,

01:29:09.644 --> 01:29:11.779
SO WE CAN ATTRACT MORE PEOPLE. I

01:29:11.846 --> 01:29:14.015
THINK ONE OF THE, ONE OF THE

01:29:14.082 --> 01:29:14.582
CHALLENGES WITH REALLY GOOD

01:29:14.649 --> 01:29:16.851
IDEAS THAT BECOME POLICY IS THAT

01:29:16.918 --> 01:29:18.519
WHAT IS OUR MEASURE OF

01:29:18.586 --> 01:29:20.521
EFFECTIVENESS AT THE END OF THIS

01:29:20.588 --> 01:29:21.155
AND SAYING, HEY, THIS REALLY

01:29:21.222 --> 01:29:23.591
WORKED OUT RIGHT? I PUT MY TIME

01:29:23.658 --> 01:29:25.393
AND EFFORT INTO THIS. AND BY THE

01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:28.396
WAY, WE INCREASED ENROLLMENT AND

01:29:28.463 --> 01:29:30.031
EDUCATION AND WE ACTUALLY

01:29:30.098 --> 01:29:32.734
IMPACTED A COMMUNITY BY 10%. SO

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:34.368
JUST SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT

01:29:34.435 --> 01:29:36.337
WITHIN THIS BILL OR MAYBE A

01:29:36.404 --> 01:29:38.439
FOLLOW UP. YEAH, I THINK THAT'S

01:29:38.506 --> 01:29:39.574
ONE ENCOURAGING THING, IS THAT

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:40.775
WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IN THE

01:29:40.842 --> 01:29:42.777
BILL IS ACTUALLY BASED ON

01:29:42.844 --> 01:29:43.611
EXACTLY THAT PROCESS BECAUSE OF

01:29:43.678 --> 01:29:45.146
THE, OF THE PILOT IN, IN

01:29:45.213 --> 01:29:46.881
RIVERSIDE COUNTY THAT CSU HAS

01:29:46.948 --> 01:29:47.715
BEEN UNDERTAKING. SO WE'RE NOT

01:29:47.782 --> 01:29:49.450
WE ARE NOT FLYING BLIND HERE. I

01:29:49.517 --> 01:29:50.918
THINK ONE OF AND THIS GETS TO

01:29:50.985 --> 01:29:52.687
THE ONE OF THE EARLIER POINTS

01:29:52.754 --> 01:29:54.922
THAT YOU MADE AS WELL IS THAT

01:29:54.989 --> 01:29:55.623
THE MEASURE HERE IS NOT JUST HOW

01:29:55.690 --> 01:29:57.859
MANY STUDENTS GO FROM NEEDLES TO

01:29:57.925 --> 01:29:59.727
CHICO STATE. THAT IS THAT IS ONE

01:29:59.794 --> 01:30:02.997
OF THEM. BUT BUT IT'S ALSO OUR

01:30:03.064 --> 01:30:04.065
EXPECTATION THAT A STUDENT THAT

01:30:04.132 --> 01:30:05.700
RECEIVES A LETTER OF ACCEPTANCE

01:30:05.767 --> 01:30:07.335
TO CHICO STATE, SAN FRANCISCO

01:30:07.401 --> 01:30:08.803
STATE, CAL STATE, STANISLAUS,

01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:10.204
WHETHER EVEN IF THEY CANNOT OR

01:30:10.271 --> 01:30:12.774
CHOOSE NOT TO GO THERE, WHAT HAS

01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:15.076
BEEN PRIMED IN THEIR BRAIN IS I

01:30:15.143 --> 01:30:18.446
AM I AM UNIVERSITY MATERIAL, AND

01:30:18.513 --> 01:30:20.548
I MAY GO TO IMPERIAL VALLEY

01:30:20.615 --> 01:30:21.682
COLLEGE. I MIGHT GO TO BARSTOW

01:30:21.749 --> 01:30:23.317
COMMUNITY COLLEGE, BUT I'M GOING

01:30:23.384 --> 01:30:24.685
THERE NOW WITH A KNOWLEDGE OF

01:30:24.752 --> 01:30:27.188
WHAT I AM CAPABLE OF. AND SO I'M

01:30:27.255 --> 01:30:28.489
GOING TO THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE,

01:30:28.556 --> 01:30:29.957
SIGN ME UP FOR THE TRANSFER

01:30:30.024 --> 01:30:31.893
PATHWAY, OR SIGN ME UP FOR THE

01:30:31.959 --> 01:30:32.894
FOR THE CTE PATHWAY, KNOWING

01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:34.796
THAT I WILL, YOU KNOW, PURSUE A

01:30:34.862 --> 01:30:36.798
BUSINESS DEGREE AFTER. BUT WE'RE

01:30:36.864 --> 01:30:38.666
SO IN THAT CASE THAT IS A

01:30:38.733 --> 01:30:39.867
SUCCESS. IF THE STUDENT GOES TO

01:30:39.934 --> 01:30:41.235
THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE,

01:30:41.302 --> 01:30:42.937
BUT WITH A DIFFERENT SENSE,

01:30:43.004 --> 01:30:44.472
MAYBE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE GONE AT

01:30:44.539 --> 01:30:45.506
ALL BEFORE. BUT NOW THEY'RE

01:30:45.573 --> 01:30:47.275
GOING AND THEY'RE GOING WITH A

01:30:47.341 --> 01:30:47.842
KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT THEY ARE

01:30:47.909 --> 01:30:50.178
CAPABLE OF BECAUSE OF THIS

01:30:50.244 --> 01:30:51.345
PROGRAM THAT IS ALSO JUST AS

01:30:51.412 --> 01:30:53.815
IMPORTANT AS A SUCCESS, AS IF

01:30:53.881 --> 01:30:54.882
THEY GO TO SAN FRANCISCO STATE.

01:30:54.949 --> 01:30:57.819
WELL, I, I REALLY LIKE THIS

01:30:57.885 --> 01:30:59.520
BILL. I THINK IT ANSWERS A LOT

01:30:59.587 --> 01:31:01.422
OF THE THINGS FOR MY COMMUNITY

01:31:01.489 --> 01:31:02.456
FROM A PSYCHOLOGICAL

01:31:02.523 --> 01:31:03.891
PERSPECTIVE, A WHOLE BUNCH OF

01:31:03.958 --> 01:31:05.159
DIFFERENT PIECES, YOU KNOW, THAT

01:31:05.226 --> 01:31:07.461
WE JUST SHOW ME THAT PIECE OF,

01:31:07.528 --> 01:31:09.463
OH, I CAN MOVE ON TO THE NEXT

01:31:09.530 --> 01:31:11.432
STEP. THIS IS GREAT. SO MOVING

01:31:11.499 --> 01:31:12.567
ON IS GOOD, AND IT'S A GREAT

01:31:12.633 --> 01:31:14.802
ENCOURAGEMENT TO OUR STUDENTS.

01:31:14.869 --> 01:31:15.369
WITH THAT, I'M INCLINED TO

01:31:15.436 --> 01:31:17.605
SUPPORT. I AM NOT INCLINED TO

01:31:17.672 --> 01:31:20.007
SUPPORT YOUR T I CHOICE BECAUSE

01:31:20.074 --> 01:31:22.610
NORMALLY YOU'RE IN A BOW TIE AND

01:31:22.677 --> 01:31:25.246
YOU THREW ME OFF COMPLETELY.

01:31:25.313 --> 01:31:28.616
POINT OF ORDER ORDER! WE LOVE

01:31:28.683 --> 01:31:30.051
CABALDON STYLES. THANK YOU SO

01:31:30.117 --> 01:31:32.954
MUCH, SUMMER. SO THANK YOU.

01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:34.622
YEAH, I JUST AGAIN WANT TO THANK

01:31:34.689 --> 01:31:37.325
THE SENATOR PRESENT STATE,

01:31:37.391 --> 01:31:38.559
WHICH, YOU KNOW, I FEEL LIKE I'M

01:31:38.626 --> 01:31:40.461
JUST GOING TO START BARKING AND

01:31:40.528 --> 01:31:43.064
YELLING GO DOGS NOW. BUT WE DO

01:31:43.130 --> 01:31:43.898
ACTUALLY HAVE THIS PROGRAM

01:31:43.965 --> 01:31:44.799
THAT'S IMPLEMENTED. IT'S CALLED

01:31:44.866 --> 01:31:47.301
BULLDOG BOUND WHERE A LOT OF THE

01:31:47.368 --> 01:31:48.469
SENIORS IN THE LOCAL AREA. AND

01:31:48.536 --> 01:31:50.571
SO WE'VE SEEN THE DATA AS WELL,

01:31:50.638 --> 01:31:51.806
WHERE A LOT OF THE ENROLLMENT

01:31:51.873 --> 01:31:53.741
SIDE OF THINGS AND A LOT OF OUR

01:31:53.808 --> 01:31:55.376
CAMPUSES HAVE DECLINED. WE JUST

01:31:55.443 --> 01:31:56.043
HAD THE LARGEST APPLICATION

01:31:56.110 --> 01:31:57.211
CLASS AND FRESHMAN CLASS FOR

01:31:57.278 --> 01:31:59.780
FRESNO STATE THIS PAST YEAR, AND

01:31:59.847 --> 01:32:01.115
I'M ON THE ALUMNI BOARD, AND

01:32:01.182 --> 01:32:03.150
THIS IS A LOT OF THE ENGAGEMENT.

01:32:03.217 --> 01:32:04.719
SO THERE'S MORE ACTIVE DATA THAT

01:32:04.785 --> 01:32:06.420
YOU NEED I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO

01:32:06.487 --> 01:32:07.788
SHARE WITH ALREADY WHAT'S BEING

01:32:07.855 --> 01:32:09.390
IMPLEMENTED IN THE PROGRAM, HOW

01:32:09.457 --> 01:32:10.925
IT'S SHOWING SUCH A LARGE SCALE.

01:32:10.992 --> 01:32:13.661
NOT ONLY THAT, A LOT OF THE

01:32:13.728 --> 01:32:14.295
STUDENTS ARE STARTING TO GO AND

01:32:14.362 --> 01:32:15.596
VISIT FRESNO STATE MORE. AND

01:32:15.663 --> 01:32:16.864
AGAIN, THAT SAME IDEOLOGY THAT

01:32:16.931 --> 01:32:18.132
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, OF JUST

01:32:18.199 --> 01:32:20.701
THAT INITIAL CONFIDENCE BUILDING

01:32:20.768 --> 01:32:21.869
SIDE OF THINGS, THAT, OKAY, I

01:32:21.936 --> 01:32:24.338
DID DO EVERYTHING I NEEDED TO DO

01:32:24.405 --> 01:32:26.607
IN HIGH SCHOOL. I DO QUALIFY FOR

01:32:26.674 --> 01:32:28.042
UNIVERSITY. AND EVEN IF YOU WANT

01:32:28.109 --> 01:32:29.911
TO TAKE A DIFFERENT ROUTE, YOU

AT LEAST KNOW THAT YOUR OPTIONS

01:32:31.879 --> 01:32:32.947
ARE AVAILABLE AND WHAT'S WHAT'S

01:32:33.014 --> 01:32:35.950
THERE FOR YOU. SO I'M MORE THAN

01:32:36.017 --> 01:32:37.618
HAPPY TO SHARE ANY OF THAT WITH

01:32:37.685 --> 01:32:38.419
WHAT FRESNO STATE HAS ALREADY

01:32:38.486 --> 01:32:39.553
IMPLEMENTED WITH THE BULLDOG

01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:41.756
BOUND PROGRAM. THE SUCCESSES

01:32:41.822 --> 01:32:43.291
THAT WE'RE ALREADY SEEING, THE

01:32:43.357 --> 01:32:44.492
LARGER SCALE OF ENROLLMENT, NOT

01:32:44.558 --> 01:32:45.860
ONLY THAT, COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT.

01:32:45.927 --> 01:32:47.194
AND AGAIN, THANK YOU FOR

01:32:47.261 --> 01:32:48.462

01:32:53.968 --> 01:32:55.303
ONE MORE COMMENT IN THE TWITTER

01:32:55.369 --> 01:32:56.103

SENATOR CABANA, FOR BRINGING

01:33:17.024 --> 01:33:17.758
THIS VERY IMPORTANT MEASURE

01:33:17.825 --> 01:33:19.427
FORWARD. APPRECIATE THE ROBUST

01:33:19.493 --> 01:33:20.795
CONVERSATION FROM MY COLLEAGUES.

01:33:20.861 --> 01:33:21.829
WE KNOW THAT WHILE THE STATE HAS

01:33:21.896 --> 01:33:22.897
MADE SIGNIFICANT STRIDES IN

01:33:22.964 --> 01:33:23.597
REDUCING BARRIERS FOR OUR

01:33:23.664 --> 01:33:24.865
STUDENTS WHO CHOOSE TO ATTEND

01:33:24.932 --> 01:33:25.900
COLLEGE AND CHOOSE TO TRANSFER

01:33:25.967 --> 01:33:27.702
TO A FOUR YEAR INSTITUTION,

01:33:27.768 --> 01:33:28.869
THERE IS MUCH MORE WORK TO BE

01:33:28.936 --> 01:33:30.638
DONE BY ESTABLISHING A STATEWIDE

01:33:30.705 --> 01:33:31.639
DIRECT ADMISSIONS PROGRAM. THIS

01:33:31.706 --> 01:33:33.708
BILL HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CHANGE

01:33:33.774 --> 01:33:35.042
THE TRAJECTORY FOR MANY STUDENTS

01:33:35.109 --> 01:33:36.544
WHO MAY NOT HAVE THOUGHT THAT

01:33:36.610 --> 01:33:38.012
COLLEGE WAS ATTAINABLE. GREATLY

01:33:38.079 --> 01:33:38.646
APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP IN

01:33:38.713 --> 01:33:39.780

MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO THE

01:33:50.024 --> 01:33:52.026

MEMBERS TO ADD ON. THANK YOU.

01:34:20.921 --> 01:34:22.223
NEXT UP WE HAVE SENATOR CABALDON

01:34:22.289 --> 01:34:24.725
PRESENTING ITEM NUMBER 11 SENATE

01:34:24.792 --> 01:34:26.560
BILL 744. WELCOME. THANK YOU,

01:34:26.627 --> 01:34:28.863
MR. CHAIR. AND I'M GOING TO TRY,

01:34:28.929 --> 01:34:30.631
IF I CAN, TO TURN DOWN THE

01:34:30.698 --> 01:34:33.701
VOLUME ON SB 744. IT IS A VERY

01:34:33.768 --> 01:34:34.769
NATIONALLY. IT'S A HOTLY

01:34:34.835 --> 01:34:36.570
CONTESTED ISSUE. BUT THIS BILL

01:34:36.637 --> 01:34:38.039
IS NOT ABOUT THE NATIONAL

01:34:38.105 --> 01:34:39.874
DEBATE. THIS BILL IS ABOUT THE

01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:40.941
CONSEQUENCES FOR CALIFORNIA

01:34:41.008 --> 01:34:42.610
STUDENTS AND THE INSTITUTIONS

01:34:42.676 --> 01:34:45.479
THAT THAT WE DEPEND UPON. SO

01:34:45.546 --> 01:34:47.348
EARLIER THIS YEAR, THE US

01:34:47.415 --> 01:34:50.184
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ISSUED A

01:34:50.251 --> 01:34:52.820
DIRECTIVE THAT WE ANTICIPATE

01:34:52.887 --> 01:34:54.455
WILL LEAD TO SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES

01:34:54.522 --> 01:34:56.357
IN THE NATIONAL ACCREDITING

01:34:56.424 --> 01:34:58.059
FRAMEWORK FOR POST-SECONDARY

01:34:58.125 --> 01:35:03.631
EDUCATION. AND. INCLUDING ISSUES

01:35:03.697 --> 01:35:04.598
AROUND DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND

01:35:04.665 --> 01:35:06.400
INCLUSION, BUT NOT ONLY IN THAT

01:35:06.467 --> 01:35:11.138
DOMAIN. AND IN PART, IT IS. THE

01:35:11.205 --> 01:35:12.940
DEPARTMENT'S OBJECTIVE IS TO

01:35:13.007 --> 01:35:14.475
TACKLE, I THINK, THE SENSE THAT

01:35:14.542 --> 01:35:15.876
THE HIGHER EDUCATION

01:35:15.943 --> 01:35:17.878
ACCREDITATION IS TOO COZY WITH

01:35:17.945 --> 01:35:19.280
ONE ANOTHER. IT'S NOT OPEN

01:35:19.346 --> 01:35:20.848
ENOUGH TO INNOVATION AND TO NEW

01:35:20.915 --> 01:35:21.982
PRACTICES. AND THESE ARE ALL

01:35:22.049 --> 01:35:23.584
PARTS OF THE NATIONAL DEBATE

01:35:23.651 --> 01:35:26.253
THAT HAVE GONE ON FOR SOME TIME.

01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:27.021
THERE HAVE OBVIOUSLY BEEN LOTS

01:35:27.088 --> 01:35:28.856
OF NEWS STORIES NATIONALLY ABOUT

01:35:28.923 --> 01:35:29.857
THREATS TO INDIVIDUAL

01:35:29.924 --> 01:35:31.425
INSTITUTIONS ON ACCREDITATION.

01:35:31.492 --> 01:35:32.793
THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS.

01:35:32.860 --> 01:35:34.228
THIS BILL IS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT

01:35:34.295 --> 01:35:36.363
THE ACCREDITING ASSOCIATIONS

01:35:36.430 --> 01:35:37.331
THEMSELVES, BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE

01:35:37.398 --> 01:35:39.633
TRYING TO AVOID IS A SITUATION

01:35:39.700 --> 01:35:41.669
WHERE STUDENTS AT AT FRESNO

01:35:41.735 --> 01:35:43.571
STATE OR AT IMPERIAL VALLEY

01:35:43.637 --> 01:35:46.607
COLLEGE ON A THURSDAY LEARNED

01:35:46.674 --> 01:35:48.275
THAT THEY THAT THEIR INSTITUTION

01:35:48.342 --> 01:35:50.578
IS NO LONGER LEGALLY AUTHORIZED

01:35:50.644 --> 01:35:52.213
TO GRANT THEIR DEGREES AND THAT

01:35:52.279 --> 01:35:54.115
THEY CAN NO LONGER HAVE A CAL

01:35:54.181 --> 01:35:56.784
GRANT. CALIFORNIA LAW REQUIRES

01:35:56.851 --> 01:35:58.619
THAT EVERY ONE OF OUR PUBLIC

01:35:58.686 --> 01:36:01.589
INSTITUTIONS BE ACCREDITED BY A

01:36:01.655 --> 01:36:03.224
USDA RECOGNIZED ACCREDITING

01:36:03.290 --> 01:36:05.426
AGENCY. SO THEY CANNOT THEY THEY

01:36:05.493 --> 01:36:06.894
CANNOT LEGALLY OPERATE IN

01:36:06.961 --> 01:36:08.295
CALIFORNIA WITHOUT THAT

01:36:08.362 --> 01:36:09.363
ACCREDITATION. AND WE HAVE BEEN

01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:10.798
THROUGH THIS CHALLENGE BEFORE,

01:36:10.865 --> 01:36:12.666
WHEN INDIVIDUAL CAMPUSES,

01:36:12.733 --> 01:36:13.767
PRINCIPALLY IN THE COMMUNITY

01:36:13.834 --> 01:36:15.803
COLLEGES, HAVE LOST OR HAVE HAD

01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:16.971
THEIR ACCREDITATION THREATENED.

01:36:17.037 --> 01:36:19.240
SO THEY CANNOT OPERATE WITHOUT

01:36:19.306 --> 01:36:20.508
ACCREDITATION. BUT IT IS NOT

01:36:20.574 --> 01:36:22.443
CLEAR, GIVEN WHAT'S BEEN

01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:25.880
PROPOSED BY USC. THERE IS THERE

01:36:25.946 --> 01:36:28.115
IS A NON-TRIVIAL POSSIBILITY

01:36:28.182 --> 01:36:30.718
THAT THE APPROVAL OF THE TWO

01:36:30.784 --> 01:36:32.553
MAIN ACCREDITING AGENCIES FOR

01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:35.156
CALIFORNIA, BOTH OF WHICH ARE

01:36:35.222 --> 01:36:36.290
WOSC ONE FOR THE SENIOR

01:36:36.357 --> 01:36:37.091
INSTITUTIONS, WHICH IN OUR CASE

01:36:37.158 --> 01:36:39.293
IS UC AND CSU AND MANY

01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:40.628
INDEPENDENT COLLEGES AND WOSC

01:36:40.694 --> 01:36:41.929
JUNIOR. I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT

01:36:41.996 --> 01:36:42.830
THEIR NAME, WHAT THEIR ACTUAL

01:36:42.897 --> 01:36:46.500
NAME IS. FOR ALL OF THE

01:36:46.567 --> 01:36:49.537
COMMUNITY COLLEGES. IF WOSC IF

01:36:49.603 --> 01:36:51.005
EITHER OF THOSE ACCREDITING

01:36:51.071 --> 01:36:52.506
AGENCIES LOSE THEIR FEDERAL

01:36:52.573 --> 01:36:56.010
APPROVAL, THEN UNDER STATE LAW,

01:36:56.076 --> 01:36:57.578
EVERY INSTITUTION THAT THEY

01:36:57.645 --> 01:36:58.979
ACCREDITED IN CALIFORNIA IS NO

01:36:59.046 --> 01:37:00.581
LONGER ACCREDITED. THAT MEANS

01:37:00.648 --> 01:37:02.249
THAT THOSE STUDENTS AT IMPERIAL

01:37:02.316 --> 01:37:03.918
VALLEY OR FRESNO STATE OR SAN

01:37:03.984 --> 01:37:05.452
DIEGO STATE OR SONOMA STATE CAN

01:37:05.519 --> 01:37:07.588
NO LONGER RECEIVE A CAL GRANT,

01:37:07.655 --> 01:37:09.190
AND THAT THEIR INSTITUTIONS ARE

01:37:09.256 --> 01:37:11.192
NO LONGER ALLOWED TO GRANT

01:37:11.258 --> 01:37:12.259
DEGREES OR OPERATE IN

01:37:12.326 --> 01:37:14.061
CALIFORNIA. AND SO WHAT ALL THIS

01:37:14.128 --> 01:37:17.865
BILL DOES IS TO IS TO SAY

01:37:17.932 --> 01:37:18.732
WHATEVER'S HAPPENING AT THE

01:37:18.799 --> 01:37:20.534
NATIONAL LEVEL, WE NEED TO HAVE

01:37:20.601 --> 01:37:24.205
SOME SAFE HARBOR SO THAT IF AN

01:37:24.271 --> 01:37:25.639
ACCREDITING AGENCY LOSES ITS

01:37:25.706 --> 01:37:27.308
AUTHORITY TO OPERATE, BUT IT

01:37:27.374 --> 01:37:29.276
STILL CONTINUES TO DO THIS TO

01:37:29.343 --> 01:37:29.910
IMPLEMENT THE SAME STANDARDS,

01:37:29.977 --> 01:37:31.212
INCLUDING ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT

01:37:31.278 --> 01:37:31.845
AND EVERYTHING ELSE, THAT IF

01:37:31.912 --> 01:37:34.248
THEY DO THAT, THAT FOR

01:37:34.315 --> 01:37:35.649
CALIFORNIA PURPOSES ONLY, WE

01:37:35.716 --> 01:37:37.351
WILL CONTINUE TO TREAT THAT

01:37:37.418 --> 01:37:39.687
INSTITUTION AS ACCREDITED. IT

01:37:39.753 --> 01:37:41.522
DOES NOT IT'S NOT A DIRECT FIGHT

01:37:41.589 --> 01:37:42.556
WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT,

01:37:42.623 --> 01:37:44.191
ALTHOUGH THAT SHOULD BE HAD. BUT

01:37:44.258 --> 01:37:46.493
THIS IS SIMPLY TO SAY THAT THE

01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:47.628
STUDENT SHOULD NOT PAY A PRICE.

01:37:47.695 --> 01:37:49.730
IF THERE IS A BATTLE GOING ON

01:37:49.797 --> 01:37:50.531
BETWEEN THE STATE, THE

01:37:50.598 --> 01:37:51.599
ACCREDITING AGENCIES AND THE

01:37:51.665 --> 01:37:53.067
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND ALL THIS

01:37:53.133 --> 01:37:54.401
BILL, THIS BILL DOES NOT PROTECT

01:37:54.468 --> 01:37:55.769
THE INSTITUTIONS INDIVIDUALLY.

01:37:55.836 --> 01:37:57.905
IF A STUDENT IF A IF A IF A

01:37:57.972 --> 01:37:59.406
CAMPUS LOSES ITS ACCREDITATION,

01:37:59.473 --> 01:38:00.407
IT LOSES ITS ACCREDITATION. IT'S

01:38:00.474 --> 01:38:02.276
NOT COVERED BY THIS BILL. IT

01:38:02.343 --> 01:38:04.545
SIMPLY SAYS THAT WOSC THE TWO

01:38:04.612 --> 01:38:06.847
WASKS THAT IF THEY IF THEIR

01:38:06.914 --> 01:38:09.183
APPROVAL TO ACCREDIT IS

01:38:09.250 --> 01:38:10.484
JEOPARDIZED OR WITHDRAWN, THAT

01:38:10.551 --> 01:38:11.919
THE INSTITUTIONS AND THEREFORE

01:38:11.986 --> 01:38:13.587
THEIR STUDENTS CAN CONTINUE TO

01:38:13.654 --> 01:38:15.723
BE ENROLLED, EARNED DEGREES, AND

01:38:15.789 --> 01:38:17.057
HAVE ACCESS TO THE CAL GRANT AND

01:38:17.124 --> 01:38:18.292
OTHER STATE FINANCIAL AID

01:38:18.359 --> 01:38:21.395
PROGRAMS. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

01:38:21.462 --> 01:38:22.696
OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IN

01:38:22.763 --> 01:38:25.266
THE HEARING ROOM. ARE THERE

01:38:25.332 --> 01:38:26.867

MODERNIZATION AND A FRESH LOOK.

01:39:01.335 --> 01:39:03.237
AND I HOPE I HOPE AGAINST HOPE

01:39:03.304 --> 01:39:04.738
THAT THAT'S PART OF WHAT COMES

01:39:04.805 --> 01:39:06.840

01:39:06.907 --> 01:39:08.642

01:42:45.592 --> 01:42:47.361
PARODY BILL. IT WOULD PROVIDE

01:42:47.427 --> 01:42:48.462
CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEES WITH

01:42:48.529 --> 01:42:49.796
THE SAME DISCIPLINARY APPEAL

THE INITIAL DISCIPLINARY ACTION,

01:43:11.652 --> 01:43:13.020
IT'S UNFAIR FOR THE SAME BOARD

SUSPEND AN EMPLOYEE TO ALSO BE

ALLEGATIONS OF INCOMPETENCE AND

01:43:29.636 --> 01:43:30.837
INSUBORDINATION. AN ARBITRATOR

01:43:30.904 --> 01:43:32.773
FOUND THAT THE DISTRICT DID NOT

01:43:32.839 --> 01:43:34.408
HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT

01:43:34.474 --> 01:43:36.009
THE TERMINATION, AND THAT THE

01:43:36.076 --> 01:43:38.512
EMPLOYEE SHOULD BE REINSTATED.

01:43:38.579 --> 01:43:40.047

01:45:14.041 --> 01:45:16.209
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING, AND THAT

01:45:16.276 --> 01:45:18.712
WE WOULD HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE

01:45:18.779 --> 01:45:19.446
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE PROCESS

01:45:19.513 --> 01:45:21.081
TO TAKE PLACE. AND WHETHER OR

01:45:21.148 --> 01:45:21.515
NOT THERE'S ENOUGH

01:45:21.581 --> 01:45:22.182
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES ACROSS

01:45:22.249 --> 01:45:23.817
THE STATE TO MANAGE THIS ISSUE.

01:45:23.884 --> 01:45:25.052
WE DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE

01:45:25.118 --> 01:45:26.920
ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH TO

01:45:26.987 --> 01:45:28.288
THIS PROPOSAL, AND HAVE CONCERNS

01:45:28.355 --> 01:45:29.489
ABOUT THE IMPACT WE'LL HAVE ON

01:45:29.556 --> 01:45:30.857
OUR MANAGING OUR EMPLOYEES GOING

01:45:30.924 --> 01:45:33.694
FORWARD. AND WITH THAT, I MUST

01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:34.828
OPPOSE THE MEASURE. THANK YOU SO

01:45:34.895 --> 01:45:37.364
MUCH. WELCOME. THANK YOU, MR.

01:45:37.431 --> 01:45:38.565
CHAIR AND MEMBERS. CHRIS REIF,

01:45:38.632 --> 01:45:39.966
ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:45:40.033 --> 01:45:40.801
SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION.

01:45:40.867 --> 01:45:42.035
FIRST, WANT TO EXTEND OUR

01:45:42.102 --> 01:45:43.437
GRATITUDE AND THANKS TO THE

01:45:43.503 --> 01:45:45.806
SENATOR AS WELL AS THE SPONSORS,

01:45:45.872 --> 01:45:47.307
AND MEETING WITH US ON THIS

01:45:47.374 --> 01:45:48.542
BILL. THIS, AS YOU KNOW, IS A

01:45:48.608 --> 01:45:50.343
REINTRODUCTION OF ANOTHER BILL

01:45:50.410 --> 01:45:51.978
THAT PASSED BY THIS COMMITTEE

01:45:52.045 --> 01:45:52.779
TWO YEARS AGO THAT WAS

01:45:52.846 --> 01:45:54.347
ULTIMATELY VETOED BY GOVERNOR

01:45:54.414 --> 01:45:58.251
NEWSOM. YOU KNOW, WE WORK

01:45:58.318 --> 01:45:59.352
STRONGLY WITH OUR PARTNERS, AND

01:45:59.419 --> 01:46:01.021
I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT WE AGREE

01:46:01.088 --> 01:46:03.290
WITH THEM 90 TO 95% OF THE TIME.

01:46:03.356 --> 01:46:03.890
UNFORTUNATELY, HERE WE ARE IN

01:46:03.957 --> 01:46:06.960
THAT 5%, IF YOU WILL. ALTHOUGH

01:46:07.027 --> 01:46:08.795
MUCH OF THE ISSUE FOR US IS ON

01:46:08.862 --> 01:46:10.897
THE K-12 SIDE, IT IS UNIQUE IN

01:46:10.964 --> 01:46:12.666
TERMS OF VERY SIMILAR TO THE

01:46:12.733 --> 01:46:13.767
CONCERNS RAISED BY MY COLLEAGUE

01:46:13.834 --> 01:46:15.635
TO MY RIGHT HERE. THIS ONE SIZE

01:46:15.702 --> 01:46:17.971
FITS ALL APPLIES TO 944 SCHOOL

01:46:18.038 --> 01:46:19.806
DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA. MANY,

01:46:19.873 --> 01:46:21.575
ALMOST 60% OF OUR SCHOOL

01:46:21.641 --> 01:46:23.510
DISTRICTS ARE SMALL AND LOCATED

01:46:23.577 --> 01:46:25.579
IN RURAL DISTRICTS. THIS BILL

01:46:25.645 --> 01:46:27.347
WOULD MANDATE ESSENTIALLY THE

01:46:27.414 --> 01:46:29.116
HIRING AND THE RETENTION OF AN

01:46:29.182 --> 01:46:29.683
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE, A

01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:31.251
PSEUDO JUDICIAL OFFICER THAT

01:46:31.318 --> 01:46:32.886
WOULD BE EXTRAORDINARILY COSTLY

01:46:32.953 --> 01:46:34.588
TO A DISTRICT AT A TIME WHEN

01:46:34.654 --> 01:46:36.723
WE'RE FACING ANY NUMBER OF

01:46:36.790 --> 01:46:37.524
UNCERTAIN TIMES AND PRESSURES,

01:46:37.591 --> 01:46:38.992
WHEN IT COMES TO THE FISCAL

01:46:39.059 --> 01:46:40.293
PRESSURES THAT WE'RE FACING, NOT

01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:41.795
JUST AT THE STATE LEVEL, BUT AT

01:46:41.862 --> 01:46:43.864
THE FEDERAL LEVEL, AS MANY OF

01:46:43.930 --> 01:46:45.799
YOU KNOW, ADDITIONALLY, THE

01:46:45.866 --> 01:46:47.567
ISSUE OF PARITY, I WOULD

01:46:47.634 --> 01:46:49.002
EXERCISE SOME CAUTION IF I COULD

01:46:49.069 --> 01:46:50.604
RECOMMEND THAT TO THE COMMITTEE,

01:46:50.670 --> 01:46:52.973
AS THE CODES ARE CONSTRUCTED

01:46:53.039 --> 01:46:54.341
DIFFERENTLY FOR DIFFERENT

01:46:54.407 --> 01:46:55.909
CLASSIFICATIONS OF EMPLOYEES. WE

01:46:55.976 --> 01:46:58.044
HAVE TEACHERS WHO GO THROUGH AND

01:46:58.111 --> 01:46:59.246
GET CREDENTIALS. IT REQUIRES

01:46:59.312 --> 01:46:59.913
THEM TO GO THROUGH A

01:46:59.980 --> 01:47:00.947
CREDENTIALING PROGRAM OR A

01:47:01.014 --> 01:47:03.049
GRADUATE SCHOOL PROGRAM, 600

01:47:03.116 --> 01:47:04.384
HOURS OF CLINICAL SERVICE TO BE

01:47:04.451 --> 01:47:05.952
ABLE TO ACQUIRE THAT CREDENTIAL.

01:47:06.019 --> 01:47:07.454
IT TAKES THEM TWO YEARS TO GET

01:47:07.521 --> 01:47:09.055
PERMANENCY FOR A SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:47:09.122 --> 01:47:09.856
COMPARATIVE TO A CLASSIFIED

01:47:09.923 --> 01:47:11.992
SCHOOL EMPLOYEE. IT CAN TAKE IT

01:47:12.058 --> 01:47:13.794
TAKES 90 DAYS TO REACH

01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:14.361
PERMANENCY. SO WHERE YOU ARE

01:47:14.427 --> 01:47:16.029
TRYING TO ADDRESS ISSUES OF

01:47:16.096 --> 01:47:18.231
PARITY, THIS IS ACTUALLY PULLING

01:47:18.298 --> 01:47:19.299
CERTAIN CODES FROM ONE SIDE OF

01:47:19.366 --> 01:47:21.134
THE EDUCATION CODE AND APPLYING

01:47:21.201 --> 01:47:21.968
IT TO CLASSIFIEDS. WHEN YOU'RE

01:47:22.035 --> 01:47:23.870
NOT DOING A HOLISTIC REVIEW OF

01:47:23.937 --> 01:47:25.639
WHAT IS TRUE PARITY, WHEN WE'RE

01:47:25.705 --> 01:47:28.208
COMPARING CLASSIFIED STAFF AND

01:47:28.275 --> 01:47:29.609
CREDENTIAL STAFF, THERE'S A LONG

01:47:29.676 --> 01:47:31.178
EDUCATIONAL POLICY HERE THAT

01:47:31.244 --> 01:47:32.813
NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT AND

01:47:32.879 --> 01:47:33.914
RESPECTED, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT

01:47:33.980 --> 01:47:35.482
TO THE COMMITTEE. BUT WE

01:47:35.549 --> 01:47:36.883
HIGHLIGHT THAT BECAUSE THIS WILL

01:47:36.950 --> 01:47:38.919
CAUSE VERY FAIRLY SERIOUS

01:47:38.985 --> 01:47:40.821
IMPLEMENTATION CONCERNS DOWN THE

01:47:40.887 --> 01:47:42.522
ROAD. AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS,

01:47:42.589 --> 01:47:44.124
AND WITH FULL RESPECT TO THE

01:47:44.191 --> 01:47:46.159
AUTHOR AND TO THE SPONSORS OF

01:47:46.226 --> 01:47:47.828
THE BILL, WE RESPECTFULLY ASK

01:47:47.894 --> 01:47:49.696
FOR YOUR NO VOTE. APOLOGIES.

01:47:49.763 --> 01:47:52.732
THANK YOU SO MUCH. THERE ARE

01:47:52.799 --> 01:47:54.968

01:49:14.114 --> 01:49:15.548
BOARD TRUSTEE IN A FAIRLY LARGE

01:49:15.615 --> 01:49:17.717
SCHOOL DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA,

01:49:17.784 --> 01:49:19.686
THE WELL-BEING OF OUR SCHOOL

01:49:19.753 --> 01:49:20.820
EMPLOYEES IS SOMETHING OF A

01:49:20.887 --> 01:49:23.690
GREAT CONCERN TO ME. I DO HAVE A

01:49:23.757 --> 01:49:25.892
FEW QUESTIONS THAT HAVE GIVEN ME

01:49:25.959 --> 01:49:29.129
PAUSE ON THIS. ONE OF THEM IS

01:49:29.195 --> 01:49:31.231
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE

01:49:31.298 --> 01:49:33.500
PROCESS FOR APPEAL ON A

01:49:33.566 --> 01:49:35.001
TERMINATION IS A LOCALLY

01:49:35.068 --> 01:49:36.670
NEGOTIATED PROCESS. IT GIVES OUR

01:49:36.736 --> 01:49:38.605
LOCAL UNIONS SOME AUTONOMY ON

01:49:38.672 --> 01:49:40.473
HOW THEY APPROACH WHAT THEY WANT

01:49:40.540 --> 01:49:41.942
TO DO WITH THEIR EMPLOYMENT

01:49:42.008 --> 01:49:43.376
STATUS, SHOULD THEY NEED TO

01:49:43.443 --> 01:49:44.945
APPEAL. AND THEN THIS WOULD

01:49:45.011 --> 01:49:47.347
SUPERSEDE THAT. I HAVE CONCERNS

01:49:47.414 --> 01:49:48.682
AROUND LOCAL CONTROL AND WANT TO

01:49:48.748 --> 01:49:50.050
MAINTAIN SOME LOCAL CONTROL FOR

01:49:50.116 --> 01:49:52.218
OUR MEMBERS. DO YOU HAVE ANY

01:49:52.285 --> 01:49:53.253
THOUGHTS ON THAT? YEAH. THANK

01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:55.288
YOU. IT'S A GREAT QUESTION. IT

01:49:55.355 --> 01:49:56.189
DOES NOT SUPERSEDE A COLLECTIVE

01:49:56.256 --> 01:49:57.924
BARGAINING AGREEMENT. AND

01:49:57.991 --> 01:50:01.461
WHEREAS THE UNION. LET'S SAY,

01:50:01.528 --> 01:50:04.064
FOR EXAMPLE, MAY WANT

01:50:04.130 --> 01:50:05.832
UNILATERALLY TO HAVE AN

01:50:05.899 --> 01:50:07.067
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE LIKE

01:50:07.133 --> 01:50:08.969
THIS BILL PROVIDES BECAUSE OF

01:50:09.035 --> 01:50:10.170
THE NATURE OF COLLECTIVE

01:50:10.236 --> 01:50:11.571
BARGAINING, OF COURSE, THERE'D

01:50:11.638 --> 01:50:13.506
HAVE TO BE AGREEMENT. AND I

01:50:13.573 --> 01:50:15.542
THINK WHAT THE CONCERN IS IN

01:50:15.608 --> 01:50:17.711
PART OF WHAT HAS BROUGHT FORWARD

01:50:17.777 --> 01:50:18.778
THE SOME OF THE ENERGY BEHIND

01:50:18.845 --> 01:50:21.381
THE BILL IS THAT ALTHOUGH THAT'S

01:50:21.448 --> 01:50:24.117
BEEN PUT ON THE TABLE AND A LOT

01:50:24.184 --> 01:50:25.452
OF DISTRICTS, THE IDEA OF HAVING

01:50:25.518 --> 01:50:28.288
A NEUTRAL OR JUST ON THE ON THE

01:50:28.355 --> 01:50:31.791
APPEAL SIDE, IT'S NOT BEEN

01:50:31.858 --> 01:50:32.859
SUCCESSFULLY BARGAINED. SO IT

01:50:32.926 --> 01:50:35.762
CAN BE BARGAINED. STILL, THE AN

01:50:35.829 --> 01:50:37.831
ARRANGEMENT CAN BE BARGAINED,

01:50:37.897 --> 01:50:40.333
BUT ONCE ONCE A DECISION IS

01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:46.172
MADE. YOU KNOW, TO GO WITH AN

01:50:46.239 --> 01:50:47.774
IT, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER

01:50:47.841 --> 01:50:50.543
THERE'S A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

01:50:50.610 --> 01:50:51.845
AGREEMENT IN PLACE THAT COVERS

01:50:51.911 --> 01:50:54.881
THIS ISSUE, THIS STATUTE WOULD

01:50:54.948 --> 01:50:57.751
REQUIRE THE ALJ. SO THAT'S IT'S

01:50:57.817 --> 01:51:00.553
NOT SUPERSEDING, BUT IT'S I

01:51:00.620 --> 01:51:02.088
PREFER TO THINK OF IT AS

01:51:02.155 --> 01:51:02.856
AUGMENTING WHAT YOU COULD DO

01:51:02.922 --> 01:51:03.957
WITH A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

01:51:04.024 --> 01:51:06.459
AGREEMENT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO

01:51:06.526 --> 01:51:08.795
SUCCESSFULLY BARGAIN IT. OKAY.

01:51:08.862 --> 01:51:10.330
AND THEN ANOTHER FOLLOW UP

01:51:10.397 --> 01:51:11.798
QUESTION I HAVE IS MANY OF OUR

01:51:11.865 --> 01:51:14.601
SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE IN HAVE A

01:51:14.667 --> 01:51:15.769
PERSONNEL COMMISSION. I THINK

01:51:15.835 --> 01:51:17.771
IT'S ABOUT A 10TH THAT STILL

01:51:17.837 --> 01:51:18.872
WORK WITH THE PERSONNEL

01:51:18.938 --> 01:51:21.074
COMMISSION. HOW WOULD THIS

01:51:21.141 --> 01:51:22.942
INTERACT WITH THE APPELLATE

01:51:23.009 --> 01:51:23.910
PROCESS THROUGH THE PERSONNEL

01:51:23.977 --> 01:51:27.113
COMMISSION? IT DOESN'T IMPACT

01:51:27.180 --> 01:51:28.982
SCULLY HEARINGS OR, YOU KNOW,

01:51:29.049 --> 01:51:32.218
ANY YOU KNOW, ANY PERSONNEL

01:51:32.285 --> 01:51:34.687
PROCESS OF THAT NATURE. I DON'T

01:51:34.754 --> 01:51:36.990
KNOW IF THERE'S BOARDS AND I'LL

01:51:37.057 --> 01:51:38.191
BE I'LL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. I'M

01:51:38.258 --> 01:51:40.160
SURE THERE'S PROBABLY PEOPLE IN

01:51:40.226 --> 01:51:40.794
THE ROOM THAT KNOW WHETHER OR

01:51:40.860 --> 01:51:42.962
NOT THERE ARE ACTUALLY BOARDS

01:51:43.029 --> 01:51:43.797
THAT HAVE SET UP COMMISSIONS,

01:51:43.863 --> 01:51:46.032
AND IF SO, MAYBE MY WITNESS CAN

01:51:46.099 --> 01:51:48.368
ANSWER THAT QUESTION. SO THIS IS

01:51:48.435 --> 01:51:48.868
SPECIFICALLY AROUND THE

01:51:48.935 --> 01:51:50.236
PERSONNEL COMMISSION, WHICH IS

01:51:50.303 --> 01:51:52.839
AN APPELLATE BODY IN THE HIRING

01:51:52.906 --> 01:51:54.908
AND TERMINATION PROCESS. I

01:51:54.974 --> 01:51:57.811
BELIEVE YOU HAVE A SITE. SO THIS

01:51:57.877 --> 01:51:59.913
BILL DOES NOT APPLY TO PERSONNEL

01:51:59.979 --> 01:52:01.381
COMMISSIONS. OKAY. THANK YOU.

01:52:01.448 --> 01:52:02.482
THAT THAT IS HELPFUL BECAUSE

01:52:02.549 --> 01:52:04.651
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL

01:52:04.717 --> 01:52:06.519
PROCESS. AND THEN ON THE BIGGER

01:52:06.586 --> 01:52:08.354
PICTURE, WHEN WE LOOK AT

01:52:08.421 --> 01:52:09.756
BUDGETS, ALL OF OUR SCHOOL

01:52:09.823 --> 01:52:10.390
DISTRICTS ARE STRUGGLING,

01:52:10.457 --> 01:52:12.926
FRANKLY, AND I AND IT'S

01:52:12.992 --> 01:52:15.095
DIFFICULT TO SAY THAT IT'S A BIG

01:52:15.161 --> 01:52:16.896
BUDGET PERSPECTIVE VERSUS AN

01:52:16.963 --> 01:52:18.398
INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEE AND THEIR

01:52:18.465 --> 01:52:19.833
GRIEVANCES. RIGHT. IT'S HARD TO

01:52:19.899 --> 01:52:21.401
PUT ONE AGAINST THE OTHER. BUT

01:52:21.468 --> 01:52:22.602
THE REALITY ALSO IS THAT THERE'S

01:52:22.669 --> 01:52:24.437
A HIGHER, SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER

01:52:24.504 --> 01:52:25.538
TURNOVER IN THE CLASSIFIED

01:52:25.605 --> 01:52:27.540
EMPLOYEE STAFF. HAVE YOU DONE AN

01:52:27.607 --> 01:52:29.976
ESTIMATE AROUND WHAT THAT COST

01:52:30.043 --> 01:52:33.546
WOULD BE LOOKING AT TYPICAL

01:52:33.613 --> 01:52:35.982
TERMINATION APPEALS IN A

01:52:36.049 --> 01:52:38.852
DISTRICT, IF CSEA HAS DONE THAT

01:52:38.918 --> 01:52:41.154
MUCH WORK IN DATA, I'LL DEFER TO

01:52:41.221 --> 01:52:42.755
THEM. WHAT WOULD THAT ADDITIONAL

01:52:42.822 --> 01:52:45.258
COST BE PER YEAR? THANK YOU. SO

01:52:45.325 --> 01:52:48.628
OUR RECORDS SHOW US THAT ROUGHLY

01:52:48.695 --> 01:52:50.296
590 CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEES

01:52:50.363 --> 01:52:54.601
ARE TERMINATED EVERY YEAR. SO IF

01:52:54.667 --> 01:52:57.704
ALL 590 OF THOSE IS THAT ACROSS

01:52:57.770 --> 01:53:00.440
THE STATE? YES. SO THERE'S NOT

01:53:00.507 --> 01:53:02.909
VERY MANY. SO IF ALL 590 OF

01:53:02.976 --> 01:53:06.579
THOSE EMPLOYEES APPEAL TO AN

01:53:06.646 --> 01:53:10.183
ALJ, THE COST WILL BE ROUGHLY

01:53:10.250 --> 01:53:12.252
4.26 MILLION. AND WE DON'T

01:53:12.318 --> 01:53:14.187
ANTICIPATE ALL OF THOSE

01:53:14.254 --> 01:53:16.356
EMPLOYEES APPEALING. AND SINCE

01:53:16.422 --> 01:53:18.424
THIS BILL ALLOWS FOR DISTRICTS

01:53:18.491 --> 01:53:20.994
AND LABOR UNIONS TO NEGOTIATE

01:53:21.060 --> 01:53:24.430
ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF AGREEMENTS,

01:53:24.497 --> 01:53:26.032
WE DON'T WE THINK THAT COSTS

01:53:26.099 --> 01:53:28.067
WILL ACTUALLY BE EVEN LOWER.

01:53:28.134 --> 01:53:32.572
OKAY, OKAY. THANK YOU FOR THAT.

01:53:32.639 --> 01:53:34.274
THANK YOU SO MUCH. ANY FURTHER

01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:36.109
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS, MR.

01:53:36.176 --> 01:53:38.244
GONZALEZ? SO JUST TO CLARIFY,

01:53:38.311 --> 01:53:41.114
THAT'S 4.2 ROUGHLY GIVE OR TAKE,

01:53:41.181 --> 01:53:45.018
WHICH IS COMES OUT TO BE ABOUT

01:53:45.084 --> 01:53:46.619
$7,000 PER INSTANCE. IS THAT

01:53:46.686 --> 01:53:51.558
CORRECT? YES. SO $7,000 PER

01:53:51.624 --> 01:53:54.460
INSTANCE, ASSUMING 5590

01:53:54.527 --> 01:53:56.930
STUDENTS. THAT'S PRETTY STEEP.

01:53:56.996 --> 01:53:59.799
OKAY. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. ANY

01:53:59.866 --> 01:54:02.168
FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS?

01:54:02.235 --> 01:54:03.102
SEEING NONE. SENATOR, WE'D LIKE

01:54:03.169 --> 01:54:05.638
TO CLOSE, PLEASE. THANK YOU VERY

01:54:05.705 --> 01:54:07.373
MUCH. I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE

01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:09.409
THAT THE CURRENT SITUATION,

01:54:09.475 --> 01:54:10.877
ASIDE FROM WHERE IT'S

01:54:10.944 --> 01:54:13.913
COLLECTIVELY BARGAINED TO HAVE A

01:54:13.980 --> 01:54:16.749
NEUTRAL IN PLACE, REQUIRES THE

01:54:16.816 --> 01:54:19.285
APPEAL TO GO RIGHT BACK TO THE

01:54:19.352 --> 01:54:19.886
SCHOOL BOARD. THAT MADE THE

01:54:19.953 --> 01:54:21.754
INITIAL DECISION IN THE FIRST

01:54:21.821 --> 01:54:22.956
PLACE. AND, WELL, I THINK IT'S

01:54:23.022 --> 01:54:24.357
IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THE

01:54:24.424 --> 01:54:27.093
APPROPRIATION OR DOWNSTREAM

01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:28.561
COSTS. THOSE ARE GREAT QUESTIONS

01:54:28.628 --> 01:54:29.562
THAT WERE JUST ASKED AND

01:54:29.629 --> 01:54:32.232
ANSWERED. ULTIMATELY, THIS COMES

01:54:32.298 --> 01:54:35.201
DOWN TO THE FAIRNESS OF DUE

01:54:35.268 --> 01:54:37.937
PROCESS. AND IT'S NOT JUST

01:54:38.004 --> 01:54:39.806
PARITY BECAUSE WE WANT TO BE

01:54:39.872 --> 01:54:41.708
LIKE THE TEACHERS OR WE WANT TO

01:54:41.774 --> 01:54:43.409
BE LIKE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE,

01:54:43.476 --> 01:54:45.245
BUT IT'S PARITY IN THE SENSE OF

01:54:45.311 --> 01:54:47.447
JUSTICE IN THE DUE PROCESS, SO

01:54:47.513 --> 01:54:50.350
THAT PEOPLE ULTIMATELY FEEL THEY

01:54:50.416 --> 01:54:52.385
GOT A FAIR DISPOSITION ON THEIR

01:54:52.452 --> 01:54:54.587
APPEAL. AND I THINK THAT'S

01:54:54.654 --> 01:54:55.088
WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE. I

01:54:55.154 --> 01:54:57.290
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

01:54:57.357 --> 01:54:58.825
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING

01:54:58.891 --> 01:55:00.093
THIS MEASURE FORWARD AND FOR

01:55:00.159 --> 01:55:02.061
WORKING WITH MY STAFF ON THE

01:55:02.128 --> 01:55:02.829
AMENDMENTS. WE KNOW THAT

01:55:02.895 --> 01:55:05.632
PROVIDING CLASSIFIED STAFF THE

01:55:05.698 --> 01:55:06.766
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE FAIR AND

01:55:06.833 --> 01:55:08.234
NEUTRAL DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS

01:55:08.301 --> 01:55:11.170
IS IMPORTANT, AND I LOOK FORWARD

01:55:11.237 --> 01:55:11.804
TO SUPPORTING THE MEASURE HERE

01:55:11.871 --> 01:55:14.007
TODAY. DO WE HAVE A MOTION, A

01:55:14.073 --> 01:55:15.775
MOTION BY MR. JACKSON? DO WE

01:55:15.842 --> 01:55:18.177
HAVE A SECOND? I'LL SECOND THE

01:55:18.244 --> 01:55:20.847
BILL. MADAM SECRETARY, ROLL CALL

01:55:20.913 --> 01:55:25.885
PLEASE. FILE ITEM NUMBER SIX AB

01:55:25.952 --> 01:55:27.654
494. THE MOTION IS DO PASS, AS

AMENDED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS

01:55:29.822 --> 01:55:35.728
COMMITTEE. FONG. FONG I. DEMAIO.

VOTING. PATEL. NOT VOTING.

01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:50.777
CELESTI. RODRIGUEZ. SHARPE.

01:55:50.843 --> 01:55:53.646
COLLINS. SHARPE. COLLINS I

01:55:53.713 --> 01:55:57.250
TAGHIPOUR. TAGHIPOUR. NO. THAT

01:55:57.317 --> 01:55:58.718
MEASURES THREE EYES, TWO NO'S

01:55:58.785 --> 01:56:00.853
AND ONE NOT VOTING WILL KEEP THE

01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:02.689
DOOR OPEN FOR ADDITIONAL MEMBERS

01:56:02.755 --> 01:56:03.589
AT ON. THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

01:56:03.656 --> 01:56:06.192
NEXT UP WE'D LIKE TO WELCOME

01:56:06.259 --> 01:56:06.893
SENATOR CORTEZ BACK FOR SB 550.

01:56:06.959 --> 01:56:08.728
ITEM NUMBER EIGHT. WELCOME,

01:56:08.795 --> 01:56:10.963
SENATOR. EVERY TIME I WANTED TO

01:56:11.030 --> 01:56:14.133
SAY IT. THANK YOU AGAIN AND

01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:19.138
AGAIN. I REALLY WANT TO THANK

01:56:19.205 --> 01:56:21.741
THE COMMITTEE, THE COMMITTEE

01:56:21.808 --> 01:56:23.543
STAFF, THE CHAIR, AND OF COURSE,

01:56:23.609 --> 01:56:26.045
ALL OF YOU FOR GIVING ME THE

01:56:26.112 --> 01:56:26.813
OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THE BILL

01:56:26.879 --> 01:56:28.715
TODAY. BUT THE COMMITTEE STAFF

01:56:28.781 --> 01:56:31.184
HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY INSTRUMENTAL

01:56:31.250 --> 01:56:32.919
IN GETTING US TO WHERE WE ARE

01:56:32.985 --> 01:56:35.188
TODAY. I'M EXTREMELY GRATEFUL

01:56:35.254 --> 01:56:36.356
AND EXTREMELY IMPRESSED WITH THE

01:56:36.422 --> 01:56:40.660
WORK. THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE

01:56:40.727 --> 01:56:43.396
BEEN PROVIDED BY THIS COMMITTEE.

01:56:43.463 --> 01:56:45.064
I'VE READ MULTIPLE TIMES. I'VE

01:56:45.131 --> 01:56:46.332
BEEN MORE IMPRESSED EACH TIME

01:56:46.399 --> 01:56:47.633
I'VE READ THEM, AND I'M

01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:48.368
CERTAINLY IN AGREEMENT WITH

01:56:48.434 --> 01:56:52.171
THEM. SO THANK YOU. THIS BILL

01:56:52.238 --> 01:56:53.639
ADDRESSES A LONG STANDING GAP IN

01:56:53.706 --> 01:56:54.707
CALIFORNIA'S LEGAL EDUCATION

01:56:54.774 --> 01:56:58.111
SYSTEM BY CREATING A PROPOSED

01:56:58.177 --> 01:56:59.579
PATHWAY FOR PUBLIC LEGAL

01:56:59.645 --> 01:57:01.381
EDUCATION PROGRAMS IN SAN JOSE.

01:57:01.447 --> 01:57:04.150
SO I WANT TO AND SPECIFICALLY IN

01:57:04.217 --> 01:57:06.452
SAN JOSE, I WANT TO THANK THE

01:57:06.519 --> 01:57:07.487
COMMITTEE AND ITS STAFF FOR

01:57:07.553 --> 01:57:09.222
THEIR THOUGHTFUL WORK. AGAIN,

01:57:09.288 --> 01:57:10.356
I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE

01:57:10.423 --> 01:57:11.691
COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS, AS I JUST

01:57:11.758 --> 01:57:15.294
SAID. BUT THE IDEA, ESPECIALLY

01:57:15.361 --> 01:57:18.998
UPON AMENDMENT, IS TO CREATE A

01:57:19.065 --> 01:57:21.701
LEGAL EDUCATION PILOT PROGRAM IN

01:57:21.768 --> 01:57:23.302
PARTNERSHIP WITH A NONPROFIT,

01:57:23.369 --> 01:57:25.438
STATE ACCREDITED LAW SCHOOL AND

01:57:25.505 --> 01:57:27.240
SAN JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY. I'LL

01:57:27.306 --> 01:57:29.108
NOTE FOR THE COMMITTEE THAT WE

01:57:29.175 --> 01:57:30.843
WILL BE CROSSING THESE MEDS IN

01:57:30.910 --> 01:57:33.479
ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

01:57:33.546 --> 01:57:36.282
THAT THE BILL IS NEXT HEADED TO.

01:57:36.349 --> 01:57:38.217
I'M COMMITTED TO THAT. THAT

01:57:38.284 --> 01:57:39.886
COMMITTEE HAS BEEN WORKING WITH

01:57:39.952 --> 01:57:41.120
US ON THESE AMENDMENTS AS WELL.

01:57:41.187 --> 01:57:43.556
SAN JOSE, AS MANY OF YOU KNOW,

01:57:43.623 --> 01:57:45.591
IS THE THIRD LARGEST CITY IN THE

01:57:45.658 --> 01:57:47.160
STATE OF CALIFORNIA, THE LARGEST

01:57:47.226 --> 01:57:49.495
CITY IN THE BAY AREA AND ONE OF

01:57:49.562 --> 01:57:50.763
THE LARGEST CITIES IN THE UNITED

01:57:50.830 --> 01:57:51.631
STATES WITHOUT A PUBLIC LAW

01:57:51.697 --> 01:57:52.732
SCHOOL. SANTA CLARA COUNTY IS

01:57:52.799 --> 01:57:54.567
HOME TO NEARLY 2 MILLION

01:57:54.634 --> 01:57:55.635
RESIDENTS. YET THE REGIONAL ACTS

01:57:55.701 --> 01:57:56.736
AND AFFORDABLE, ACCESSIBLE

01:57:56.803 --> 01:57:58.171
OPTIONS FOR LEGAL EDUCATION IN

01:57:58.237 --> 01:58:00.339
SANTA CLARA COUNTY, OVER 65% OF

01:58:00.406 --> 01:58:02.108
THE POPULATION IDENTIFIES AS

01:58:02.175 --> 01:58:04.677
ASIAN OR LATINO. BOTH GROUPS

01:58:04.744 --> 01:58:06.112
REMAIN SEVERELY UNDERREPRESENTED

01:58:06.179 --> 01:58:07.847
AMONG LICENSED ATTORNEYS.

01:58:07.914 --> 01:58:09.749
STATEWIDE, THE AVERAGE DEBT FOR

01:58:09.816 --> 01:58:12.852
LAW GRADUATES NOW EXCEEDS

01:58:12.919 --> 01:58:14.654
$130,000. THE 2024 STUDY,

01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:16.622
CONDUCTED BY THE AMERICAN BAR

01:58:16.689 --> 01:58:18.791
ASSOCIATION, FOUND THAT 67% OF

01:58:18.858 --> 01:58:20.126
ALL YOUNG LAWYERS, INCLUDING

01:58:20.193 --> 01:58:22.094
THOSE WITH AND WITHOUT LOANS,

01:58:22.161 --> 01:58:23.463
REPORTED FEELING STRESS ABOUT

01:58:23.529 --> 01:58:24.831
THEIR FINANCES, AND THOSE

01:58:24.897 --> 01:58:27.300
NUMBERS ARE DIRECTLY TIED TO

01:58:27.366 --> 01:58:28.901
PRIVATE LAW SCHOOL TUITION.

01:58:28.968 --> 01:58:30.536
AGAIN, I WANTED TO DISTINGUISH

01:58:30.603 --> 01:58:33.139
AND EMPHASIZE WHY A PUBLIC

01:58:33.206 --> 01:58:35.241
OPTION IS IMPORTANT. THIS COST

01:58:35.308 --> 01:58:36.709
BARRIER DRIVES TALENT AWAY FROM

01:58:36.776 --> 01:58:37.877
PUBLIC SERVICE CAREERS, AND

01:58:37.944 --> 01:58:39.212
PREVENTS FIRST GENERATION AND

01:58:39.278 --> 01:58:40.413
UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS FROM

01:58:40.480 --> 01:58:42.415
ENTERING THE LEGAL PROFESSION. A

01:58:42.482 --> 01:58:44.250
2024 STUDY FROM THE EQUAL

01:58:44.317 --> 01:58:46.085
JUSTICE FROM THE ORGANIZATION

01:58:46.152 --> 01:58:48.588
EQUAL JUSTICE WORKS, FOUND THAT

01:58:48.654 --> 01:58:50.022
79% OF RECENT LAW SCHOOL

01:58:50.089 --> 01:58:52.358
GRADUATES CITE LOW SALARY AS A

01:58:52.425 --> 01:58:53.626
REASON THEY WOULD NOT PURSUE

01:58:53.693 --> 01:58:56.462
PUBLIC INTEREST LAW. IN 2023,

01:58:56.529 --> 01:58:59.999
ONLY 9.7% OF LAW GRADUATES

01:59:00.066 --> 01:59:02.335
SECURED PUBLIC INTEREST JOBS.

01:59:02.401 --> 01:59:05.071
THIS AMOUNTS TO ONLY 3095

01:59:05.137 --> 01:59:07.940
POSITIONS. 92% OF LOW INCOME

01:59:08.007 --> 01:59:10.543
AMERICANS CIVIL LEGAL NEEDS WENT

01:59:10.610 --> 01:59:15.615
UNMET IN 2022, 92% UNMET, AND AN

01:59:15.681 --> 01:59:17.383
ESTIMATED 150 MILLION LEGAL

01:59:17.450 --> 01:59:18.951
PROBLEMS GO UNRESOLVED ANNUALLY

01:59:19.018 --> 01:59:20.987
IN THE UNITED STATES BY

01:59:21.053 --> 01:59:22.588
AUTHORIZING A PARTNERSHIP OF THE

01:59:22.655 --> 01:59:25.958
SORT HAS BEEN OUTLINED IN THE

01:59:26.025 --> 01:59:26.926
BILL, WITH THE AMENDMENTS

01:59:26.993 --> 01:59:29.462
BETWEEN SAN JOSE STATE AND A

01:59:29.529 --> 01:59:31.197
NONPROFIT, STATE ACCREDITED LAW

01:59:31.264 --> 01:59:33.566
SCHOOL. THIS BILL, SB 550,

01:59:33.633 --> 01:59:36.135
THROUGH THIS PILOT PROGRAM, WILL

01:59:36.202 --> 01:59:37.837
HELP CLOSE THOSE GAPS AND

01:59:37.904 --> 01:59:39.272
ESTABLISH THAT THEY CAN BE

01:59:39.338 --> 01:59:40.773
FURTHER CLOSED IN THE FUTURE.

01:59:40.840 --> 01:59:42.542
THE BILL WOULD ALLOW SAN JOSE

01:59:42.608 --> 01:59:43.976
STATE, THE NONPROFIT LAW SCHOOL,

01:59:44.043 --> 01:59:46.345
TO JOINTLY AWARD JD DEGREES AS

01:59:46.412 --> 01:59:48.247
WELL AS UNDERGRADUATE LEGAL

01:59:48.314 --> 01:59:50.383
EDUCATION CERTIFICATES. BOTH THE

01:59:50.449 --> 01:59:51.918
CSU BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND THE

01:59:51.984 --> 01:59:53.219
GOVERNING BOARD OF THE NONPROFIT

01:59:53.286 --> 01:59:54.387
LAW SCHOOL MUST APPROVE THE

01:59:54.453 --> 01:59:56.522
PILOT PROGRAM, LEST THERE BE ANY

01:59:56.589 --> 01:59:59.692
DOUBT ABOUT THAT. THAT IS NOW

01:59:59.759 --> 02:00:02.628
PART OF THIS BILL WITH US TODAY

02:00:02.695 --> 02:00:04.764
IS MAGNUS HERRLEIN. HE'S THE

02:00:04.830 --> 02:00:06.465
FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE SAN JOSE

02:00:06.532 --> 02:00:08.868
STATE UNIVERSITY PRE-LAW SOCIETY

02:00:08.935 --> 02:00:10.536
AND WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM HIM.

02:00:10.603 --> 02:00:12.038
AND IN THE MEANWHILE, I'D

02:00:12.104 --> 02:00:13.839
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

02:00:13.906 --> 02:00:15.207
THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME.

02:00:15.274 --> 02:00:17.076
THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON, CHAIR

02:00:17.143 --> 02:00:18.611
FONG AND MEMBERS OF THE

02:00:18.678 --> 02:00:20.046
COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS MAGNUS

02:00:20.112 --> 02:00:21.647
HERRLEIN AND I AM A PROUD RECENT

02:00:21.714 --> 02:00:23.215
GRADUATE OF SAN JOSE STATE

02:00:23.282 --> 02:00:24.984
UNIVERSITY. TO HIGHLIGHT THE

02:00:25.051 --> 02:00:28.020
IMPORTANCE OF SB 55, I WANT TO

02:00:28.087 --> 02:00:29.789
FIRST BRIEFLY TELL YOU A LITTLE

02:00:29.855 --> 02:00:31.490
BIT ABOUT MY STORY. IN HIGH

02:00:31.557 --> 02:00:32.925
SCHOOL, I HAD A SEMESTER WHERE I

02:00:32.992 --> 02:00:36.162
HAD A 2.7 GPA AND I FELT PRETTY

02:00:36.228 --> 02:00:38.664
LOST. BUT COMING TO CSU WAS THE

02:00:38.731 --> 02:00:40.066
BEST DECISION THAT I EVER MADE.

02:00:40.132 --> 02:00:42.435
I ENDED UP TURNING THAT 2.7 INTO

02:00:42.501 --> 02:00:45.037
A 3.97, AND SAN JOSE STATE WAS

02:00:45.104 --> 02:00:46.906
THE PLACE THAT REALLY MADE ME

02:00:46.973 --> 02:00:48.040
FLOURISH. I WORKED HARD EVERY

02:00:48.107 --> 02:00:49.842
DAY, AND THIS COMING FALL I WILL

02:00:49.909 --> 02:00:51.577
ATTEND LAW SCHOOL AT UC LAW SAN

02:00:51.644 --> 02:00:54.213
FRANCISCO. BUT MY STORY IS NOT

02:00:54.280 --> 02:00:56.716
UNIQUE. IT IS THE SDSU STORY AND

02:00:56.782 --> 02:00:57.650
ONE STORY THAT I HAVE HEARD

02:00:57.717 --> 02:00:59.452
COUNTLESS TIMES FROM MY PEERS.

02:00:59.518 --> 02:01:01.420
THE STORY OF SAN JOSE STATE IS

02:01:01.487 --> 02:01:03.489
ABOUT GIVING PEOPLE A CHANCE AT

02:01:03.556 --> 02:01:06.459
SUCCESS, AND THAT IS WHY SB 550

02:01:06.525 --> 02:01:08.194
MATTERS. BY CREATING THE FIRST

02:01:08.260 --> 02:01:10.029
PUBLIC LAW SCHOOL IN THE CSU

02:01:10.096 --> 02:01:11.397
SYSTEM, STUDENTS LIKE ME AND

02:01:11.464 --> 02:01:12.698
STUDENTS WHO WILL COME AFTER ME

02:01:12.765 --> 02:01:15.101
WILL BE GIVEN A CHANCE AT A

02:01:15.167 --> 02:01:16.168
LEGAL EDUCATION. ACCORDING TO

02:01:16.235 --> 02:01:19.005
THE STATE BAR, ABOUT 75% OF

02:01:19.071 --> 02:01:20.272
ATTORNEYS CHANGE THEIR INITIAL

02:01:20.339 --> 02:01:21.907
CAREER PLANS, AND THIS WAS

02:01:21.974 --> 02:01:23.876
LARGELY DUE TO THE HIGH COST OF

02:01:23.943 --> 02:01:25.811
LEGAL EDUCATION. MANY OF THOSE

02:01:25.878 --> 02:01:26.912
CHANGES CAME FROM A PUBLIC

02:01:26.979 --> 02:01:28.614
INTEREST ROLE INTO A PRIVATE

02:01:28.681 --> 02:01:30.916
SECTOR ROLE. SIMPLY PUT,

02:01:30.983 --> 02:01:32.652
CALIFORNIA IS LOSING OUT ON MANY

02:01:32.718 --> 02:01:33.753
PUBLIC INTEREST LAWYERS DUE TO

02:01:33.819 --> 02:01:37.023
THE COST OF EDUCATION. THE CSU

02:01:37.089 --> 02:01:38.391
SYSTEM WAS CREATED TO SERVE THE

02:01:38.457 --> 02:01:40.359
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA, AND THAT

02:01:40.426 --> 02:01:41.594
SHOULD INCLUDE PROVIDING ACCESS

02:01:41.661 --> 02:01:44.196
TO AN ATTAINABLE, QUALITY LEGAL

02:01:44.263 --> 02:01:45.931
EDUCATION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR

02:01:45.998 --> 02:01:47.099
CONSIDERATION AND I HUMBLY ASK

02:01:47.166 --> 02:01:48.768
FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL.

02:01:48.834 --> 02:01:51.103
THANK YOU SO MUCH. OTHER

02:01:51.170 --> 02:01:52.204
WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IN THE

02:01:52.271 --> 02:01:55.174
HEARING ROOM. ARE THERE

02:01:55.241 --> 02:01:57.076
WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IN THE

02:01:57.143 --> 02:02:13.826
HEARING ROOM?

02:02:14.493 --> 02:02:16.896
WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON, MR.

02:02:16.962 --> 02:02:18.264
CHAIR, AND MEMBERS. JESSICA

02:02:18.330 --> 02:02:19.498
DUONG WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF

02:02:19.565 --> 02:02:20.866
CALIFORNIA HERE IN RESPECTFUL

02:02:20.933 --> 02:02:22.768
OPPOSITION TO SB 550. I WANT TO

02:02:22.835 --> 02:02:24.970
START BY THANKING THE CHAIR AND

02:02:25.037 --> 02:02:25.905
THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR

02:02:25.971 --> 02:02:27.373
THOUGHTFUL WORK IN TRYING TO

02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:28.841
THREAD THE NEEDLE ON THIS ISSUE.

02:02:28.908 --> 02:02:29.909
HOWEVER, WE REMAIN OPPOSED EVEN

02:02:29.975 --> 02:02:31.677
WITH THE AMENDMENTS. WE

02:02:31.744 --> 02:02:33.112
APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S INTENT

02:02:33.179 --> 02:02:35.014
IN PROVIDING A PUBLIC LAW SCHOOL

02:02:35.081 --> 02:02:35.948
OPTION IN THIS DISTRICT.

02:02:36.015 --> 02:02:37.783
HOWEVER, THE MASTER PLAN OF

02:02:37.850 --> 02:02:38.918
HIGHER EDUCATION MAINTAINS THAT

02:02:38.984 --> 02:02:40.753
UC HAS THE EXCLUSIVE AUTHORITY

02:02:40.820 --> 02:02:42.188
TO OFFER DOCTORAL DEGREES FOR

02:02:42.254 --> 02:02:44.223
THE PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION

02:02:44.290 --> 02:02:45.758
SEGMENTS. WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT

02:02:45.825 --> 02:02:46.759
SINCE THE MASTER PLAN WAS

02:02:46.826 --> 02:02:49.228
ADOPTED IN 1960, EDUCATION AND

02:02:49.295 --> 02:02:50.329
LABOR WORKFORCE NEEDS HAVE

02:02:50.396 --> 02:02:52.198
CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE

02:02:52.264 --> 02:02:54.333
STATE. THAT'S WHY IN 2023, WE

02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:56.869
CAME TO AN AGREEMENT WITH CSU TO

02:02:56.936 --> 02:02:59.305
AUTHORIZE CSU TO OFFER DOCTORAL

02:02:59.371 --> 02:03:00.906
DEGREES. AND THIS LAW INCLUDES A

02:03:00.973 --> 02:03:02.942
REVIEW PROCESS THAT WOULD ENSURE

02:03:03.008 --> 02:03:04.376
NON-DUPLICATION OF EXISTING UC

02:03:04.443 --> 02:03:06.378
DEGREE PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION,

02:03:06.445 --> 02:03:07.947
THE RECENTLY PASSED STATE BUDGET

02:03:08.013 --> 02:03:09.348
INCLUDES FUNDING FOR

02:03:09.415 --> 02:03:10.249
INTERSEGMENTAL COORDINATION OF

02:03:10.316 --> 02:03:12.351
HIGHER EDUCATION, DISCUSSIONS

02:03:12.418 --> 02:03:13.753
AROUND REVISITING THE MASTER

02:03:13.819 --> 02:03:16.021
PLAN OR STATE WORKFORCE NEEDS

02:03:16.088 --> 02:03:17.356
MAY BE BEST DISCUSSED WITHIN

02:03:17.423 --> 02:03:18.858
THIS COORDINATING ENTITY,

02:03:18.924 --> 02:03:21.060
INSTEAD OF PIECEMEAL APPROACHES.

02:03:21.127 --> 02:03:22.128
FOR THESE REASONS, WE MUST

02:03:22.194 --> 02:03:23.395
CONTINUE TO RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE

02:03:23.462 --> 02:03:26.966
SB 550. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

02:03:27.032 --> 02:03:28.334
WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON, CHAIR

02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:29.368
AND MEMBERS, ALEX GRAVES WITH

02:03:29.435 --> 02:03:30.703
THE ASSOCIATION OF INDEPENDENT

02:03:30.770 --> 02:03:31.504
CALIFORNIA COLLEGES AND

02:03:31.570 --> 02:03:33.105
UNIVERSITIES, REPRESENTING 87

02:03:33.172 --> 02:03:34.673
PRIVATE, NONPROFIT COLLEGES AND

02:03:34.740 --> 02:03:36.175
UNIVERSITIES IN THE STATE. ALSO

02:03:36.242 --> 02:03:37.977
HERE, IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION

02:03:38.043 --> 02:03:40.579
TO THE BILL, I WANT TO ECHO MY

02:03:40.646 --> 02:03:42.381
COLLEAGUE'S COMMENTS AND THAT WE

02:03:42.448 --> 02:03:44.316
APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE

02:03:44.383 --> 02:03:46.485
COMMITTEE TO MAKE AMENDMENTS TO

02:03:46.552 --> 02:03:48.721
THE BILL. BUT I THINK

02:03:48.788 --> 02:03:49.255
FUNDAMENTALLY, WE DO STILL

02:03:49.321 --> 02:03:52.224
REMAIN IN AN OPPOSED POSITION. I

02:03:52.291 --> 02:03:53.759
APPRECIATE THE INTEREST IN

02:03:53.826 --> 02:03:57.062
THINKING ABOUT HOW TO PROVIDE

02:03:57.129 --> 02:04:00.366
AFFORDABLE, ACCESSIBLE ACCESS TO

02:04:00.432 --> 02:04:02.501
LAW DEGREES, LAW PROFESSIONS AND

02:04:02.568 --> 02:04:04.203
OTHER HIGH NEED FIELDS THAT WE

02:04:04.270 --> 02:04:05.805
SEE IN THE WORKFORCE AND IN

02:04:05.871 --> 02:04:07.473
CERTAIN REGIONS OF THE STATE,

02:04:07.540 --> 02:04:09.542
WHETHER THAT'S THE HEALTH

02:04:09.608 --> 02:04:10.976
PROFESSIONS, LAW, TEACHING.

02:04:11.043 --> 02:04:12.878
THOSE ARE, AGAIN, CRITICAL

02:04:12.945 --> 02:04:14.046
PROFESSIONS AND IMPORTANT

02:04:14.113 --> 02:04:16.048
DISCUSSIONS TO HAVE. WE

02:04:16.115 --> 02:04:18.417
SIMILARLY BELIEVE THAT THE $1.5

02:04:18.484 --> 02:04:19.852
MILLION ALLOCATED IN THE STATE

02:04:19.919 --> 02:04:20.820
BUDGET TO FORM A HIGHER ED

02:04:20.886 --> 02:04:22.555
WORKFORCE AND COORDINATING BODY

02:04:22.621 --> 02:04:24.790
WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE FORUM

02:04:24.857 --> 02:04:26.725
TO HAVE THIS TYPE OF ROBUST

02:04:26.792 --> 02:04:28.060
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS AND KIND

02:04:28.127 --> 02:04:30.229
OF NEEDS ASSESSMENT TO THINK

02:04:30.296 --> 02:04:31.564
ABOUT BOTH THE PROBLEMS AND

02:04:31.630 --> 02:04:34.066
SOLUTIONS FOR HOW WE MOVE

02:04:34.133 --> 02:04:37.369
FORWARD. YOU KNOW, WE AGAIN,

02:04:37.436 --> 02:04:38.537
ABSOLUTELY SHARE THE GOALS

02:04:38.604 --> 02:04:39.471
AROUND ACCESSIBLE, AFFORDABLE

02:04:39.538 --> 02:04:41.273
ACCESS TO THESE TYPES OF HIGH

02:04:41.340 --> 02:04:43.142
NEED PROFESSIONS. THE NEED FOR

02:04:43.209 --> 02:04:44.877
THESE TYPES OF DISCUSSIONS IS

02:04:44.944 --> 02:04:46.412
GOING TO BE COMPOUNDED BY THE

02:04:46.478 --> 02:04:47.046
RECENT ACTION BY CONGRESS TO

02:04:47.112 --> 02:04:48.881
ELIMINATE GRADUATE PLUS LOANS,

02:04:48.948 --> 02:04:49.915
AND WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

02:04:49.982 --> 02:04:52.051
THAT. WELCOME THOSE DISCUSSIONS

02:04:52.117 --> 02:04:53.686
TO HOW WE ENSURE WE HAVE THIS

02:04:53.752 --> 02:04:55.654
PIPELINE FOR THE PROFESSIONS AND

02:04:55.721 --> 02:04:57.489
OTHERS. AND WHILE WE APPRECIATE

02:04:57.556 --> 02:04:59.124
THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TO MOVE

02:04:59.191 --> 02:05:00.726
TOWARDS A JOINT PILOT DEGREE

02:05:00.793 --> 02:05:02.862
MODEL, WE DO REMAIN CONCERNED

02:05:02.928 --> 02:05:04.396
FUNDAMENTALLY THAT BY

02:05:04.463 --> 02:05:06.065
AUTHORIZING A JOINT DEGREE PILOT

02:05:06.131 --> 02:05:07.700
WITH THE CSU, THAT WE ARE KIND

02:05:07.766 --> 02:05:09.668
OF CONTINUING THIS PIECEMEAL

02:05:09.735 --> 02:05:11.503
APPROACH OF STRAYING FROM THE

02:05:11.570 --> 02:05:12.738
EXISTING FRAMEWORK THAT IS IN

02:05:12.805 --> 02:05:14.139
PLACE REGARDING DEGREE AUTHORITY

02:05:14.206 --> 02:05:15.207
FOR THE DIFFERENT SEGMENTS. AND

02:05:15.274 --> 02:05:16.675
SO FOR THOSE REASONS, WE REMAIN

02:05:16.742 --> 02:05:19.044
OPPOSED AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU.

02:05:19.111 --> 02:05:20.446
ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN

02:05:20.512 --> 02:05:22.615
OPPOSITION IN THE HEARING ROOM?

02:05:22.681 --> 02:05:24.049
ARE THERE ANY TWEENERS IN THE

02:05:24.116 --> 02:05:27.586
HEARING ROOM? SO MEMBERS, ANY

02:05:27.653 --> 02:05:28.220
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS? SENATOR

02:05:28.287 --> 02:05:31.490
GONZALEZ? SENATOR, THANK YOU FOR

02:05:31.557 --> 02:05:33.225
BRINGING THIS BILL. I JUST HAVE

02:05:33.292 --> 02:05:37.129
A FEW FEW QUESTIONS AS I HAVE

02:05:37.196 --> 02:05:39.632
CALIFORNIA DESERT TRIAL ACADEMY

02:05:39.698 --> 02:05:42.801
SCHOOL OF LAW IS IN MY DISTRICT,

02:05:42.868 --> 02:05:44.737
THE ONLY LAW SCHOOL IN RIVERSIDE

02:05:44.803 --> 02:05:48.274
COUNTY. SO I'M TRYING TO

02:05:48.340 --> 02:05:49.675
UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS

02:05:49.742 --> 02:05:51.543
HERE, OBVIOUSLY, FOR MY OWN

02:05:51.610 --> 02:05:53.946
DISTRICT AND THEN THE CALIFORNIA

02:05:54.013 --> 02:05:56.048
IMPLICATIONS ACROSS THE BOARD.

02:05:56.115 --> 02:05:58.050
WHAT WHAT IS THE WHAT WHAT IS

02:05:58.117 --> 02:06:03.322
THE MOTIVATION FOR THIS SPECIFIC

02:06:03.389 --> 02:06:04.823
BILL? WHAT WAS THE INITIAL

02:06:04.890 --> 02:06:07.660
MOTIVATION, THE MOTIVATION FOR

02:06:07.726 --> 02:06:10.129
THIS SPECIFIC BILL IS THE FACT

02:06:10.195 --> 02:06:12.331
THAT WE DON'T HAVE A PUBLIC LAW

02:06:12.398 --> 02:06:13.732
SCHOOL IN THE COUNTY. IT'S

02:06:13.799 --> 02:06:15.434
ACTUALLY A LITTLE SMALLER THAN

02:06:15.501 --> 02:06:18.237
RIVERSIDE COUNTY TO A LITTLE

02:06:18.304 --> 02:06:20.239
OVER 2 MILLION PEOPLE BY RECENT

02:06:20.306 --> 02:06:23.175
COUNT. THE 1960 MASTER PLAN

02:06:23.242 --> 02:06:26.045
ASSEMBLY MEMBER WAS 65 YEARS

02:06:26.111 --> 02:06:27.813
AGO. I WAS FOUR YEARS OLD AT THE

02:06:27.880 --> 02:06:30.049
TIME. IN THE MEANTIME, I

02:06:30.115 --> 02:06:31.984
CONTINUED MY OWN EDUCATION. I

02:06:32.051 --> 02:06:33.519
GRADUATED FROM THE NONPROFIT LAW

02:06:33.585 --> 02:06:34.653
SCHOOL, THE STATE ACCREDITED LAW

02:06:34.720 --> 02:06:36.822
SCHOOL MYSELF IN THIS AREA, AS

02:06:36.889 --> 02:06:38.624
DID ONE OF OUR FORMER POLICE

02:06:38.691 --> 02:06:40.859
CHIEFS, NUMEROUS JUDGES, THE

02:06:40.926 --> 02:06:42.594
FIRST INDEPENDENT POLICE

02:06:42.661 --> 02:06:45.898
AUDITOR, THE FIRST LATINA

02:06:45.965 --> 02:06:46.765
INDEPENDENT POLICE AUDITOR IN

02:06:46.832 --> 02:06:48.400
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE

02:06:48.467 --> 02:06:51.003
CITY OF SAN JOSE, WHO LATER

02:06:51.070 --> 02:06:51.570
BECAME A SITTING JUDGE, AND

02:06:51.637 --> 02:06:54.540
NUMEROUS OTHER FOLKS WHO LOOK

02:06:54.606 --> 02:06:57.176
FOR A PUBLIC OPTION TO GO TO LAW

02:06:57.242 --> 02:06:58.944
SCHOOL, COULDN'T FIND ONE AND

02:06:59.011 --> 02:07:01.347
ENDED UP GOING TO A NONPROFIT,

02:07:01.413 --> 02:07:03.816
ACCREDITED LAW SCHOOL. IN 1960

02:07:03.882 --> 02:07:04.984
WHEN THE MASTER. BUT I'M

02:07:05.050 --> 02:07:06.485
BRINGING THIS UP AS IRRELEVANT

02:07:06.552 --> 02:07:07.419
BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT THE

02:07:07.486 --> 02:07:08.654
OPPOSITION IS TALKING ABOUT.

02:07:08.721 --> 02:07:11.123
THEY'RE HANGING THEIR HAT ON A

02:07:11.190 --> 02:07:16.128
1960 MASTER PLAN. SAN JOSE HAD

02:07:16.195 --> 02:07:18.931
95,000 POPULATION AT THAT TIME.

02:07:18.998 --> 02:07:21.900
AS WE KNOW BY CENSUS 95,000, IT

02:07:21.967 --> 02:07:25.104
HAS 1.1 MILLION TODAY. IT WAS AN

02:07:25.170 --> 02:07:26.805
AREA OF PRUNE ORCHARDS AND PEARS

02:07:26.872 --> 02:07:30.075
AND APRICOTS AND OPEN FIELDS,

02:07:30.142 --> 02:07:33.112
DAIRIES. THERE'S NO WAY THAT

02:07:33.178 --> 02:07:35.547
MASTER PLAN DEVISED AT THAT TIME

02:07:35.614 --> 02:07:38.050
COULD HAVE POSSIBLY CONTEMPLATED

02:07:38.117 --> 02:07:39.284
THAT THERE WOULD BE THE NEED FOR

02:07:39.351 --> 02:07:40.953
A LAW SCHOOL IN THE MIDDLE OF

02:07:41.020 --> 02:07:43.122
SILICON VALLEY, IN A IN A CITY

02:07:43.188 --> 02:07:44.556
THAT CALLS ITSELF THE CAPITAL OF

02:07:44.623 --> 02:07:46.191
SILICON VALLEY. WHETHER YOU

02:07:46.258 --> 02:07:47.393
AGREE WITH THAT OR NOT, THE

02:07:47.459 --> 02:07:49.061
THIRD LARGEST CITY IN THE STATE

02:07:49.128 --> 02:07:50.662
OF CALIFORNIA, THE LARGEST CITY

02:07:50.729 --> 02:07:52.064
IN THE BAY AREA WITH ONE OF THE

02:07:52.131 --> 02:07:53.799
MOST DIVERSE POPULATIONS IN THE

02:07:53.866 --> 02:07:55.401
WORLD, THERE'S NO WAY THE 1960

02:07:55.467 --> 02:07:57.903
MASTER PLAN COULD ACCOUNT FOR

02:07:57.970 --> 02:08:00.305
THAT. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT

02:08:00.372 --> 02:08:02.608
MORE CLOSELY, THE FRANKLY, THE

02:08:02.674 --> 02:08:05.344
OBSTINANCE IN IN IN WILLINGNESS

02:08:05.411 --> 02:08:06.578
TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THESE KIND

02:08:06.645 --> 02:08:08.247
OF NEEDS YEAR AFTER YEAR, DECADE

02:08:08.313 --> 02:08:10.382
AFTER DECADE, I THINK,

02:08:10.449 --> 02:08:14.086
CONSTITUTES DE FACTO REDLINING.

02:08:14.153 --> 02:08:17.189
BECAUSE THE ANSWER WHEN WE ASKED

02:08:17.256 --> 02:08:18.857
IN TERMS OF AUTHOR AMENDMENTS,

02:08:18.924 --> 02:08:20.626
IF, YOU SEE, WOULD BE WILLING TO

02:08:20.692 --> 02:08:22.761
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS AND BE AT

02:08:22.828 --> 02:08:24.229
THE TABLE WITH AN OPTION FOR

02:08:24.296 --> 02:08:25.764
FIRST RIGHT OF REFUSAL, IN CASE

02:08:25.831 --> 02:08:27.833
THIS IS REALLY SIMPLY JUST A

02:08:27.900 --> 02:08:28.867
JURISDICTIONAL ISSUE BETWEEN

02:08:28.934 --> 02:08:30.736
THEM AND CSU. THEY SAID NO, FLAT

02:08:30.803 --> 02:08:32.838
OUT NO. AND I THINK YOU COULD

02:08:32.905 --> 02:08:33.806
QUESTION THE WITNESSES TODAY AND

02:08:33.872 --> 02:08:35.641
THEY WOULD STILL SAY NO. WELL,

02:08:35.707 --> 02:08:38.277
IF IT'S NO AND WE'RE UNWILLING

02:08:38.343 --> 02:08:40.079
TO BE AT THE TABLE, WE'RE ALSO

02:08:40.145 --> 02:08:41.747
UNWILLING TO ACCOUNT IN OUR

02:08:41.814 --> 02:08:42.948
MASTER PLAN FOR CHANGES THAT

02:08:43.015 --> 02:08:45.651
HAVE OCCURRED OVER 65 YEARS IN

02:08:45.717 --> 02:08:47.186
ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGED AREAS

02:08:47.252 --> 02:08:50.022
OF THE WORLD. THEN THERE'S

02:08:50.089 --> 02:08:51.824
SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON HERE.

02:08:51.890 --> 02:08:53.625
BUT BUT THE REAL MOTIVATION IS

02:08:53.692 --> 02:08:55.160
FOR THE STUDENTS THEMSELVES. YOU

02:08:55.227 --> 02:08:56.428
KNOW, THE STUDENTS THAT ATTEND

02:08:56.495 --> 02:08:58.864
THIS SCHOOL NOW ARE MUCH LIKE

02:08:58.931 --> 02:09:00.866
THE STUDENTS THAT ATTENDED

02:09:00.933 --> 02:09:03.335
DECADES AGO WHEN I WENT. IN SOME

02:09:03.402 --> 02:09:04.503
WAYS, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE

02:09:04.570 --> 02:09:06.338
TYPICALLY WORKING. IT'S A FOUR

02:09:06.405 --> 02:09:08.040
YEAR EVENING PROGRAM. THERE ARE

02:09:08.107 --> 02:09:09.274
PRIVATE SCHOOLS, FOR EXAMPLE,

02:09:09.341 --> 02:09:11.410
THAT HAVE A FOUR YEAR EVENING

02:09:11.477 --> 02:09:13.278
PROGRAMS. IT'S A FOUR YEAR

02:09:13.345 --> 02:09:15.314
EVENING PROGRAM THAT'S NOT AS

02:09:15.380 --> 02:09:17.783
EXPENSIVE BY ANY ACCOUNT AS YOU

02:09:17.850 --> 02:09:19.485
SEE, OR CERTAINLY AS SANTA CLARA

02:09:19.551 --> 02:09:21.620
UNIVERSITY OR STANFORD OR BOALT

02:09:21.687 --> 02:09:25.724
HALL. AND THOSE STUDENTS ARE

02:09:25.791 --> 02:09:29.228
OFTENTIMES SINGLE MOMS. CASE IN

02:09:29.294 --> 02:09:34.299
POINT. ONE OF MY. A FORMER

02:09:34.366 --> 02:09:36.135
MEMBER OF MY STAFF, WHEN I WAS A

02:09:36.201 --> 02:09:37.269
COUNTY SUPERVISOR WHO WORKED IN

02:09:37.336 --> 02:09:39.304
MY OFFICE FOR ABOUT A YEAR

02:09:39.371 --> 02:09:42.274
LATER, ADVISED ME THAT SHE WAS

02:09:42.341 --> 02:09:44.343
ATTENDING, MOST RECENTLY

02:09:44.409 --> 02:09:46.145
ATTENDING THE STATE ACCREDITED

02:09:46.211 --> 02:09:49.481
SCHOOL IN SAN JOSE WITH THREE

02:09:49.548 --> 02:09:53.418
CHILDREN. AGAIN, SINGLE MOM, YOU

02:09:53.485 --> 02:09:54.586
KNOW, BORROWING AND WORKING HER

02:09:54.653 --> 02:09:57.689
WAY THROUGH THAT PROGRAM. SHE IS

02:09:57.756 --> 02:10:01.293
NOW A3L. SHE HAS ESSENTIALLY A

02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:03.896
YEAR AND A HALF LEFT TO GO TO BE

02:10:03.962 --> 02:10:06.064
SITTING FOR THE BAR. THERE'S

02:10:06.131 --> 02:10:08.167
JUST NO WAY AN INDIVIDUAL LIKE

02:10:08.233 --> 02:10:11.403
THAT WHO HAD FREED HERSELF FROM

02:10:11.470 --> 02:10:12.671
GANG AFFILIATION AS A YOUNG

02:10:12.738 --> 02:10:18.277
LADY, WORKED AND WORKED TO GAIN

02:10:18.343 --> 02:10:21.079
A JOB AS A LEGAL SECRETARY AND A

02:10:21.146 --> 02:10:22.881
PARALEGAL CAN FIND ANY OTHER

02:10:22.948 --> 02:10:25.784
OPTION FOR MOVING FORWARD WITH

02:10:25.851 --> 02:10:28.320
WITH HER DREAM, HER DREAM TO BE

02:10:28.387 --> 02:10:30.622
A LAWYER, TO SIT FOR THE BAR AND

02:10:30.689 --> 02:10:33.458
THEN BE A LAWYER IN THE STATE OF

02:10:33.525 --> 02:10:34.026
CALIFORNIA. MANY OF THESE

02:10:34.092 --> 02:10:36.261
STUDENTS CHOOSE IMMIGRATION LAW,

02:10:36.328 --> 02:10:39.131
PUBLIC SERVICE LAW. NOT ALL, I

02:10:39.198 --> 02:10:40.632
CERTAINLY DIDN'T. SOME OF THE

02:10:40.699 --> 02:10:42.901
OTHER EXAMPLES ARE OF FOLKS WHO

02:10:42.968 --> 02:10:45.003
CHOSE OTHER PROFESSIONS. WE'RE

02:10:45.070 --> 02:10:48.006
JUST TRYING TO CREATE

02:10:48.073 --> 02:10:49.741
OPPORTUNITY IN AN AREA THAT'S

02:10:49.808 --> 02:10:51.376
THAT'S BEEN BOTTLENECKED,

02:10:51.443 --> 02:10:54.580
INTENTIONALLY OR OR OTHERWISE

02:10:54.646 --> 02:10:59.718
BY, YOU KNOW, WHATEVER REASON IN

02:10:59.785 --> 02:11:02.221
THE LEGISLATION IS INTENDED NOW

02:11:02.287 --> 02:11:03.989
A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE

02:11:04.056 --> 02:11:06.758
FIRST PUT IN PRINT TO REALLY

02:11:06.825 --> 02:11:10.462
CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE

02:11:10.529 --> 02:11:12.264
SCHOOLS, THE SUBJECTS OF THE

02:11:12.331 --> 02:11:15.100
LEGISLATION, TO NOT ONLY HAVE

02:11:15.167 --> 02:11:16.668
DIALOG, BUT SEE IF THERE'S A

02:11:16.735 --> 02:11:18.370
POSSIBILITY OF THEM DURING THE

02:11:18.437 --> 02:11:19.972
TIME FRAMES AND THE GUARDRAILS

02:11:20.038 --> 02:11:21.873
THAT ARE LISTED NOW IN THE BILL

02:11:21.940 --> 02:11:25.944
AND THE AMENDMENTS TO. TO COME

02:11:26.011 --> 02:11:28.046
UP WITH SOME KIND OF AN

02:11:28.113 --> 02:11:29.881
INTEGRATION, SOME KIND OF AN

02:11:29.948 --> 02:11:30.749
INTEGRATION PLAN WHERE THEY CAN

02:11:30.816 --> 02:11:34.353
DO WORK TOGETHER, THE PHYSICAL

02:11:34.419 --> 02:11:35.954
LOCATION OF THE TWO SCHOOLS IN

02:11:36.021 --> 02:11:38.557
QUESTION HERE ARE BACK TO BACK

02:11:38.624 --> 02:11:40.926
PHYSICALLY IN SAN JOSE STATE. IF

02:11:40.993 --> 02:11:42.494
YOU'RE NOT AWARE, I WON'T GO

02:11:42.561 --> 02:11:44.162
INTO ALL THAT. WE DON'T HAVE THE

02:11:44.229 --> 02:11:46.331
TIME, BUT IT HAS VERY MUCH BEEN

02:11:46.398 --> 02:11:47.799
IN AN EXPANSIONIST POSTURE,

02:11:47.866 --> 02:11:49.368
TAKING OVER FROM THE CITY, THE

02:11:49.434 --> 02:11:52.137
REPERTORY THEATER SHARING THE

02:11:52.204 --> 02:11:53.038
CONSTRUCTION OF THE MARTIN

02:11:53.105 --> 02:11:55.073
LUTHER KING LIBRARY WITH A MODEL

02:11:55.140 --> 02:11:56.908
LIBRARY IN THE AREA, AND SO ON,

02:11:56.975 --> 02:11:58.543
TAKING OVER THE STATE BUILDING

02:11:58.610 --> 02:12:01.513
WHERE OUR OFFICES USED TO BE. SO

02:12:01.580 --> 02:12:03.348
IT IT SEEMS LIKE THE TIME IS

02:12:03.415 --> 02:12:05.250
RIPE TO LOOK AT THIS, BUT WE

02:12:05.317 --> 02:12:06.585
DON'T WANT TO WASTE PEOPLE'S

02:12:06.652 --> 02:12:08.754
TIME. WE WANT TO TELL THEM, GO

02:12:08.820 --> 02:12:10.055
LOOK AT THIS, KNOWING THAT YOU

02:12:10.122 --> 02:12:12.057
HAVE SOME PRETTY RESTRICTIVE

02:12:12.124 --> 02:12:13.358
LEGISLATION IN PLACE THAT

02:12:13.425 --> 02:12:15.594
ENABLES YOU TO DO THAT. BUT

02:12:15.661 --> 02:12:17.562
YEAH, GO AHEAD AND DO IT. THAT'S

02:12:17.629 --> 02:12:22.067
THE IDEA. SO, SO TO THE TO THE

02:12:22.134 --> 02:12:23.769
OPPOSITION. I'LL SUPPORT YOU TO

02:12:23.835 --> 02:12:25.971
REBUT ON THAT. BUT ALSO I WANT

02:12:26.038 --> 02:12:28.774
TO ASK YOU AS A FOLLOW ON,

02:12:28.840 --> 02:12:33.111
COULDN'T THERE BE A èC

02:12:33.178 --> 02:12:35.347
SATELLITE PROGRAM THAT ADDRESSES

02:12:35.414 --> 02:12:39.284
THIS SAME PIECE OR A FULLY

02:12:39.351 --> 02:12:40.852
ONLINE OPTION THAT ADDRESSES THE

02:12:40.919 --> 02:12:43.255
SAME PIECE? SO NUMBER ONE FIRST

02:12:43.322 --> 02:12:44.589
QUESTION WAS WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE

02:12:44.656 --> 02:12:46.258
THE MOTIVATION IS BEHIND THIS

02:12:46.325 --> 02:12:49.494
BILL? NUMBER TWO IS COULDN'T YOU

02:12:49.561 --> 02:12:51.463
CREATE A SATELLITE PROGRAM IN

02:12:51.530 --> 02:12:55.701
THAT IN THAT AREA AND OR A FULLY

02:12:55.767 --> 02:12:59.137
ONLINE OPTION. TO THE. YEAH. TO

02:12:59.204 --> 02:13:03.175
YOU GUYS. YEAH. WHEN IT COMES TO

02:13:03.241 --> 02:13:05.043
A FULLY ONLINE OPTION, THAT IS

02:13:05.110 --> 02:13:06.345
NOT SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE

02:13:06.411 --> 02:13:08.180
EXPLORED. THERE ARE OTHER ONLINE

02:13:08.246 --> 02:13:10.082
LAW SCHOOLS. FOR EXAMPLE, PURDUE

02:13:10.148 --> 02:13:12.851
IS AN ONLINE PROGRAM THAT IS A

02:13:12.918 --> 02:13:14.986
STATE ACCREDITED AS WELL. AS FAR

02:13:15.053 --> 02:13:18.256
AS HAVING A LIKE A LOCALIZED

02:13:18.323 --> 02:13:21.526
PROGRAM, WE DO HAVE A SEVERAL

02:13:21.593 --> 02:13:22.861
THREE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW

02:13:22.928 --> 02:13:25.564
SCHOOLS. SO THEN COLLEGE OF LAW,

02:13:25.630 --> 02:13:28.433
SAN FRANCISCO, AND THE ONE AT

02:13:28.500 --> 02:13:30.268
BERKELEY IS ABOUT AN HOUR DRIVE,

02:13:30.335 --> 02:13:31.636
ABSENT TRAFFIC, OF COURSE,

02:13:31.703 --> 02:13:32.571
BECAUSE TRAFFIC IS TERRIBLE IN

02:13:32.637 --> 02:13:35.273
THE BAY AREA. AND THEN BUT IT'S

02:13:35.340 --> 02:13:36.308
ALSO ACCESSIBLE BY PUBLIC

02:13:36.375 --> 02:13:37.876
TRANSIT. SO THEN WE HAVEN'T

02:13:37.943 --> 02:13:39.745
REALLY EXPLORED THAT AS AN

02:13:39.811 --> 02:13:41.913
OPTION. BUT THEN THOSE LAW

02:13:41.980 --> 02:13:45.951
SCHOOLS ARE NOT TOO FAR AWAY

02:13:46.017 --> 02:13:47.853
FROM SAN JOSE AS WELL. SO IT

02:13:47.919 --> 02:13:50.255
KIND OF REINFORCES HIS, HIS

02:13:50.322 --> 02:13:54.926
ARGUMENT THEN OF ACCESSIBILITY

02:13:54.993 --> 02:13:59.598
FOR THAT REGION. RIGHT. BUT

02:13:59.664 --> 02:14:01.133
BECAUSE OF TRAFFIC, TIME,

02:14:01.199 --> 02:14:02.067
DISTANCE, DIRECTION, IT

02:14:02.134 --> 02:14:03.568
REINFORCES THE FACT THAT THERE'S

02:14:03.635 --> 02:14:06.138
A NEED FOR THIS PROGRAM IN THAT

02:14:06.204 --> 02:14:08.607
AREA WOULD AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT

02:14:08.673 --> 02:14:12.110
I JUST HEARD YOU SAY. I MEAN, MY

02:14:12.177 --> 02:14:13.779
RESPONSE TO THAT ARGUMENT WOULD

02:14:13.845 --> 02:14:16.515
BE, WE DO HAVE TWO PRETTY CLOSE

02:14:16.581 --> 02:14:18.717
OPTIONS. IT'S NOT IDEAL, OF

02:14:18.784 --> 02:14:20.118
COURSE, FOR IF YOU'RE LIVING AT

02:14:20.185 --> 02:14:22.287
HOME FROM SAN JOSE. AND OF

02:14:22.354 --> 02:14:23.989
COURSE, TRAFFIC IS PRETTY

02:14:24.055 --> 02:14:26.291
INCONVENIENT AS WELL. BUT THEN

02:14:26.358 --> 02:14:29.761
IT'S COMMUTABLE AND ALSO LIKE

02:14:29.828 --> 02:14:32.297
OPENING UP A NEW UC LAW SCHOOL

02:14:32.364 --> 02:14:33.899
IN SAN JOSE, FOR EXAMPLE, WOULD

02:14:33.965 --> 02:14:35.934
BE VERY EXPENSIVE TO DO, AND WE

02:14:36.001 --> 02:14:37.803
DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING TO DO

02:14:37.869 --> 02:14:40.338
THAT AT THIS POINT. SO BECAUSE

02:14:40.405 --> 02:14:45.610
OF THAT. LIKE I GET THAT PIECE

02:14:45.677 --> 02:14:49.915
OF BEING OF THE SENATOR'S

02:14:49.981 --> 02:14:53.518
ARGUMENT OF PROXIMITY, RIGHT? I

02:14:53.585 --> 02:14:56.555
GET MAGNUS GREAT NAME, BY THE

02:14:56.621 --> 02:14:59.724
WAY. THANK YOU. I GET I GET THE,

02:14:59.791 --> 02:15:02.994
THE HOW SAN JOSE HAS BEEN THE

02:15:03.061 --> 02:15:05.130
RIGHT FIT FOR YOU. WE NEVER KNOW

02:15:05.197 --> 02:15:06.698
WHAT THE RIGHT FIT IS UNTIL WE

02:15:06.765 --> 02:15:08.567
GET INTO THAT. SO I GET THOSE

02:15:08.633 --> 02:15:10.635
PIECES. I ALSO UNDERSTAND THE

02:15:10.702 --> 02:15:12.070
UK'S POSITION ON THIS, AND I'M

02:15:12.137 --> 02:15:14.206
TRYING TO MAYBE CREATE A BRIDGE.

02:15:14.272 --> 02:15:16.208
WHERE IS THAT BRIDGE? BUT I

02:15:16.274 --> 02:15:19.611
DON'T HEAR A BRIDGE THERE FOR

02:15:19.678 --> 02:15:21.880
THAT COMMUNITY THAT'S IN NEED.

02:15:21.947 --> 02:15:24.516
MY ONLY MY PAWS. I HAVE TWO

02:15:24.583 --> 02:15:26.418
PAUSES TO THIS AND I'LL AND I'LL

02:15:26.485 --> 02:15:29.688
HAND THIS OFF IS NUMBER ONE AND

02:15:29.754 --> 02:15:32.491
I WON'T NAME THIS THE SCHOOL,

02:15:32.557 --> 02:15:34.125
BUT IT'S IN THE IT'S IN THE

02:15:34.192 --> 02:15:38.930
NOTES HERE. IS THERE THEIR EXAM

02:15:38.997 --> 02:15:43.668
PASS RATE, WHICH IS PRETTY LOW.

02:15:43.735 --> 02:15:46.238
AND HOW WOULD THAT CHANGE WITH

02:15:46.304 --> 02:15:50.208
THE MERGER. WOULD THOSE

02:15:50.275 --> 02:15:51.943
PROFESSORS BE LET GO. AND NOW WE

02:15:52.010 --> 02:15:53.445
HAVE NEW PROFESSORS UNDER THIS

02:15:53.512 --> 02:15:57.482
NEW SCHOOL. SO THAT'S THAT'S ONE

02:15:57.549 --> 02:15:59.017
PIECE OF THE PUZZLE OR THE

02:15:59.084 --> 02:16:00.685
CURRICULUM OR WHAT. HOW DO YOU

02:16:00.752 --> 02:16:02.888
INCREASE IT FROM 30.9 TO

02:16:02.954 --> 02:16:04.055
SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT BETTER?

02:16:04.122 --> 02:16:05.624
BECAUSE THEN ALL WE WERE DOING

02:16:05.690 --> 02:16:07.425
IS JUST MOVING THE PROBLEM OVER.

02:16:07.492 --> 02:16:09.895
RIGHT? AND MY THE SECOND PIECE

02:16:09.961 --> 02:16:15.400
TO THIS PUZZLE IS, IS THE

02:16:15.467 --> 02:16:17.202
FUNDING MECHANISM ASSOCIATED

02:16:17.269 --> 02:16:20.772
WITH THIS. THOSE ARE MY TWO MY

02:16:20.839 --> 02:16:24.209
TWO BIGGEST CONCERNS. AND I

02:16:24.276 --> 02:16:26.645
DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE AN ANSWER

02:16:26.711 --> 02:16:27.946
TO THE FIRST ONE, THE BAR PASS

02:16:28.013 --> 02:16:29.347
RATE, MOST RECENT BAR PASS RATE

02:16:29.414 --> 02:16:32.984
WAS 49 POINT SOMETHING PERCENT.

02:16:33.051 --> 02:16:35.554
I THAT'S ON THE RECORD. THAT WAS

02:16:35.620 --> 02:16:38.356
JUST CELEBRATED AT THE SCHOOL

02:16:38.423 --> 02:16:40.825
AND CALIFORNIA STATE BAR.

02:16:40.892 --> 02:16:42.427
ESSENTIALLY THE ACCREDITATION.

02:16:42.494 --> 02:16:45.897
IT'S NOT BASED ON ONE CRITERIA

02:16:45.964 --> 02:16:47.799
BAR PASS RATE. THERE'S A NUMBER

02:16:47.866 --> 02:16:50.368
OF CRITERIA THE STATE BAR LOOKS

02:16:50.435 --> 02:16:52.103
AT, BUT IT'S THEIR ACCREDITATION

02:16:52.170 --> 02:16:53.838
PROCESS. AND BAR PASS RATE IS

02:16:53.905 --> 02:16:55.640
THE MOST IMPORTANT. THIS SCHOOL

02:16:55.707 --> 02:16:57.475
LIKE I THINK A LOT OF SCHOOLS

02:16:57.542 --> 02:17:00.812
STARTED RUNNING INTO PROBLEMS

02:17:00.879 --> 02:17:02.747
DURING COVID AND THEIR BAR PASS

02:17:02.814 --> 02:17:04.049
RATE. AND WHAT YOU MAY BE

02:17:04.115 --> 02:17:07.919
LOOKING AT IS WHERE IT WENT DOWN

02:17:07.986 --> 02:17:11.489
POST PANDEMIC. AND THE SCHOOL IS

02:17:11.556 --> 02:17:13.458
ACCREDITED NOW AND IT HAS TO

02:17:13.525 --> 02:17:14.659
MAINTAIN ITS BAR PASS RATE. THIS

02:17:14.726 --> 02:17:15.860
BILL REQUIRES THE SCHOOL TO

02:17:15.927 --> 02:17:18.763
MAINTAIN ITS BAR PASS RATE FOR

02:17:18.830 --> 02:17:20.565
FIVE CONSECUTIVE YEARS, NOT THE

02:17:20.632 --> 02:17:22.300
EXACT BAR PASS RATE, BUT TO

02:17:22.367 --> 02:17:23.468
MAINTAIN ITS ACCREDITATION,

02:17:23.535 --> 02:17:24.936
WHICH WOULD INCLUDE ITS BAR PASS

02:17:25.003 --> 02:17:26.671
RATE FOR FIVE CONSECUTIVE YEARS.

02:17:26.738 --> 02:17:29.608
TO EVEN BE ELIGIBLE FOR ANY ANY

02:17:29.674 --> 02:17:31.810
FURTHER, ANY FURTHER WORK UNDER

02:17:31.876 --> 02:17:34.245
THIS BILL. SO WE'VE, IN EFFECT,

02:17:34.312 --> 02:17:35.580
TAKEN THE WORD MERGER OUT OF

02:17:35.647 --> 02:17:37.282
THIS BILL, CREATED A PILOT WHERE

02:17:37.349 --> 02:17:39.618
IF THEY CAN STAND UP A

02:17:39.684 --> 02:17:41.820
COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIP AS

02:17:41.886 --> 02:17:45.624
DESCRIBED HERE. THEY'LL HAVE THE

02:17:45.690 --> 02:17:48.293
ABILITY TO OPERATE THAT FOR SIX

02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:51.096
YEARS. AND, YOU KNOW, WITH THE

02:17:51.162 --> 02:17:53.665
SUNSET THAT TIES ALL OF THAT,

02:17:53.732 --> 02:17:55.700
ALL OF THOSE DATES TOGETHER,

02:17:55.767 --> 02:17:58.536
BASICALLY THE NUMBER OF YEARS

02:17:58.603 --> 02:18:01.539
THAT THEY HAVE TO BE.

02:18:01.606 --> 02:18:02.540
CONSISTENTLY BAR ACCREDITED, THE

02:18:02.607 --> 02:18:05.110
NUMBER OF YEARS THAT THEY CAN

02:18:05.176 --> 02:18:06.578
OPERATE UNDER THIS BILL. AND

02:18:06.645 --> 02:18:09.147
THEN, YOU KNOW, AS I SAID, A

02:18:09.214 --> 02:18:13.451
SUNSET, I THAT'S ONE OF YOUR

02:18:13.518 --> 02:18:15.920
QUESTIONS. BUT WILL SAN JOSE

02:18:15.987 --> 02:18:19.924
STATE ABSORB THE FISCAL

02:18:19.991 --> 02:18:21.660
CHALLENGES THAT THIS CURRENT

02:18:21.726 --> 02:18:24.229
SCHOOL IS HAVING, OR WILL IT BE

02:18:24.295 --> 02:18:25.964
INDEPENDENT OF SAN JOSE STATE?

02:18:26.031 --> 02:18:29.801
THAT'S THAT'S UP TO THEM TO

02:18:29.868 --> 02:18:31.302
NEGOTIATE. IF THEY DON'T, IF

02:18:31.369 --> 02:18:32.871
THEY AREN'T UNABLE TO NEGOTIATE

02:18:32.937 --> 02:18:33.605
AN OPERATING AGREEMENT AMONGST

02:18:33.672 --> 02:18:37.942
THEMSELVES, ALL OF THIS IS MOOT.

02:18:38.009 --> 02:18:39.310
THIS ALL OF THIS HINGES IS ONE

02:18:39.377 --> 02:18:41.746
OF THE VERY SPECIFIC GUARDRAILS

02:18:41.813 --> 02:18:43.448
LISTED IN THE BILL. LISTED IN

02:18:43.515 --> 02:18:47.886
THE AMENDMENTS IS THAT. THAT

02:18:47.952 --> 02:18:50.789
BOTH OF THE ENTITIES THEMSELVES

02:18:50.855 --> 02:18:53.124
IN SEPARATE FROM CSU TRUSTEES,

02:18:53.191 --> 02:18:54.392
BUT THE ENTITIES THEMSELVES HAVE

02:18:54.459 --> 02:18:56.227
TO SIGN OFF ON ON A FINAL

02:18:56.294 --> 02:18:57.762
OPERATING AGREEMENT BEFORE

02:18:57.829 --> 02:18:59.864
ANYTHING CAN GO FORWARD. SO

02:18:59.931 --> 02:19:01.266
THAT'LL BE A BUSINESS

02:19:01.332 --> 02:19:04.869
NEGOTIATION? I'M NOT SURE. IF

02:19:04.936 --> 02:19:06.705
IT'LL BE SUCCESSFUL OR NOT. AT

02:19:06.771 --> 02:19:07.939
THE END OF THE DAY, I'D

02:19:08.006 --> 02:19:09.741
CERTAINLY DO ANYTHING I COULD TO

02:19:09.808 --> 02:19:11.976
HELP FACILITATE IT. IT'S

02:19:12.043 --> 02:19:14.913
PRESUMED FROM AN AUTHOR'S

02:19:14.979 --> 02:19:16.748
STANDPOINT THAT THE AFFILIATION

02:19:16.815 --> 02:19:19.617
WITH SAN JOSE STATE, A MORE

02:19:19.684 --> 02:19:21.920
FORMAL AFFILIATION THAN ANY KIND

02:19:21.986 --> 02:19:25.123
OF SHARING, CAN HELP LIBRARY

02:19:25.190 --> 02:19:27.992
WOULD BE TOP OF MIND INSTANTLY.

02:19:28.059 --> 02:19:30.495
STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO A

02:19:30.562 --> 02:19:33.364
LIBRARY THAT'S LITERALLY WALKING

02:19:33.431 --> 02:19:34.466
DISTANCE ACROSS CAMPUS, FROM

02:19:34.532 --> 02:19:36.434
SECOND STREET OVER TO THIRD

02:19:36.501 --> 02:19:38.169
STREET TO WALK RIGHT INTO SAN

02:19:38.236 --> 02:19:40.205
JOSE STATE LIBRARY, ACTUALLY

02:19:40.271 --> 02:19:42.073
FOURTH, FOURTH STREET. SO IT'S

02:19:42.140 --> 02:19:45.276
TWO BLOCKS. YOU KNOW, THERE'S

02:19:45.343 --> 02:19:47.112
ANY NUMBER OF AS WE ALL KNOW, I

02:19:47.178 --> 02:19:49.581
THINK MOST EVERY ONE OF US AT

02:19:49.647 --> 02:19:51.416
SOME POINT CAME OUT OF A FOUR

02:19:51.483 --> 02:19:53.184
YEAR UNDERGRAD ENVIRONMENT.

02:19:53.251 --> 02:19:55.987
THERE ARE GOING TO BE SO MANY

02:19:56.054 --> 02:19:57.922
SUPPORTS FOR STUDENTS JUST ON

02:19:57.989 --> 02:20:01.025
THE NATURAL THAT ARE AVAILABLE

02:20:01.092 --> 02:20:02.494
THAT WOULDN'T BE AVAILABLE TO

02:20:02.560 --> 02:20:03.995
NEIGHBORING STUDENTS, YOU KNOW,

02:20:04.062 --> 02:20:07.565
COMING IN AND OUT. SO. YOU KNOW,

02:20:07.632 --> 02:20:08.733
IT COULD RANGE FROM MENTAL

02:20:08.800 --> 02:20:12.537
HEALTH SERVICES TO, LIKE I SAID,

02:20:12.604 --> 02:20:14.339
THE IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO LAW

02:20:14.405 --> 02:20:17.542
BOOKS AND THINGS THAT DROP IN

02:20:17.609 --> 02:20:19.811
CENTERS FOR COMPUTER USE AND SO

02:20:19.878 --> 02:20:21.913
FORTH. SO, YOU KNOW, ALL OF THAT

02:20:21.980 --> 02:20:25.150
IS EXCITING TO THINK ABOUT. WE

02:20:25.216 --> 02:20:27.385
DON'T THINK IT'S EXCLUSIVE TO

02:20:27.452 --> 02:20:29.554
CSU. YOU KNOW, THAT THERE ARE

02:20:29.621 --> 02:20:31.089
OTHER KINDS OF ARRANGEMENTS IN

02:20:31.156 --> 02:20:32.657
THE WORLD THAT COULD LEAD TO

02:20:32.724 --> 02:20:34.292
THAT SAME KIND OF SYNERGY. BUT

02:20:34.359 --> 02:20:37.695
BUT HERE, THE NATURAL SYNERGY IS

02:20:37.762 --> 02:20:40.231
WORD PROXIMITY. I THINK THE

02:20:40.298 --> 02:20:41.733
PROXIMITY OF THESE TWO SCHOOLS

02:20:41.800 --> 02:20:43.868
ALONE JUMPS OUT AT YOU AS, WHY

02:20:43.935 --> 02:20:45.703
AREN'T THEY WORKING MORE CLOSELY

02:20:45.770 --> 02:20:47.105
TOGETHER, YOU KNOW, FOR THE

02:20:47.172 --> 02:20:49.307
BENEFIT OF STUDENTS AND

02:20:49.374 --> 02:20:51.109
PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS? CAN I JUST

02:20:51.176 --> 02:20:53.244
SAY, LASTLY, YOU MENTIONED

02:20:53.311 --> 02:20:55.747
ACCESS. WE ALL KNOW. YOU ALL

02:20:55.814 --> 02:20:57.015
KNOW BECAUSE YOU SERVE ON THIS

02:20:57.081 --> 02:20:58.249
COMMITTEE. I'VE NEVER SERVED ON

02:20:58.316 --> 02:20:59.717
A HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITTEE,

02:20:59.784 --> 02:21:00.819
ONLY AN EDUCATION COMMITTEE IN

02:21:00.885 --> 02:21:03.955
THE SENATE. BUT ACCESS AND

02:21:04.022 --> 02:21:06.291
AFFORDABILITY ARE TWO

02:21:06.357 --> 02:21:07.759
SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS OF THE

02:21:07.826 --> 02:21:10.161
MASTER PLAN. SO WHAT THEN

02:21:10.228 --> 02:21:13.431
REMAINS IS THIS ISSUE OF

02:21:13.498 --> 02:21:16.568
JURISDICTION. I, YOU KNOW, AND

02:21:16.634 --> 02:21:17.769
WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO GET STUCK

02:21:17.836 --> 02:21:19.804
THERE OR NOT. THANK YOU. THANK

02:21:19.871 --> 02:21:23.174
YOU SO MUCH, SENATOR JACKSON.

02:21:23.241 --> 02:21:25.577
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SENATOR. I

02:21:25.643 --> 02:21:27.779
CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE NEED.

02:21:27.846 --> 02:21:31.850
AND I THINK THAT. UNFORTUNATELY,

02:21:31.916 --> 02:21:33.785
WE KNOW THAT THE MASTER PLAN IS

02:21:33.852 --> 02:21:36.588
REALLY OUTDATED AND IT'S NOT

02:21:36.654 --> 02:21:38.823
ANYONE'S FAULT EXCEPT THE

02:21:38.890 --> 02:21:41.526
LEGISLATURE'S FAULT. AND BECAUSE

02:21:41.593 --> 02:21:44.896
WE FAILED TO CREATE A PROCESS

02:21:44.963 --> 02:21:46.731
FOR THIS MASTER PLAN IS UPDATED

02:21:46.798 --> 02:21:49.701
PERIODICALLY. WE ARE FOUND

02:21:49.767 --> 02:21:51.002
OURSELVES IN THESE TYPE OF

02:21:51.069 --> 02:21:53.771
SITUATIONS. SO I DON'T I DON'T

02:21:53.838 --> 02:21:56.808
REALLY FIND ARGUMENTS UTILIZING

02:21:56.875 --> 02:21:58.409
THE MASTER PLAN OF WHY WE CAN'T

02:21:58.476 --> 02:21:59.777
DO SOMETHING, BECAUSE I DON'T

02:21:59.844 --> 02:22:01.980
THINK IT'S VALID, BECAUSE IT'S

02:22:02.046 --> 02:22:03.781
JUST OUTDATED. AND AGAIN, IT'S

02:22:03.848 --> 02:22:06.351
NO ONE'S FAULT. I MEAN, THIS IS

02:22:06.417 --> 02:22:07.318
THE POSITION WE'VE BEEN PUT.

02:22:07.385 --> 02:22:11.689
WE'VE PUT SYSTEMS IN. AND SO WE

02:22:11.756 --> 02:22:12.924
NEED TO AND WHAT WE'VE DONE IN

02:22:12.991 --> 02:22:15.527
THE PAST, WHEN WE'VE GONE

02:22:15.593 --> 02:22:17.395
OUTSIDE OF THE MASTER PLAN,

02:22:17.462 --> 02:22:19.631
WE'VE SAID THAT A PARTICULAR

02:22:19.697 --> 02:22:21.332
REGION, A PARTICULAR COMMUNITY

02:22:21.399 --> 02:22:23.835
REALLY NEEDS THIS. AND YOU

02:22:23.902 --> 02:22:25.637
SHOULDN'T HAVE TO VENTURE

02:22:25.703 --> 02:22:27.939
OUTSIDE OF YOUR OWN COMMUNITIES

02:22:28.006 --> 02:22:31.175
OR YOUR OWN REGION TO BE ABLE TO

02:22:31.242 --> 02:22:32.844
RECEIVE THE TYPE OF EDUCATION

02:22:32.911 --> 02:22:36.547
SERVICES THAT YOU NEED. AND SO I

02:22:36.614 --> 02:22:38.416
LOOK FORWARD TO. WE'D LOVE TO

02:22:38.483 --> 02:22:40.385
WORK WITH YOU. I WOULD LOVE TO

02:22:40.451 --> 02:22:42.954
WORK WITH YOU, MR. CHAIR. IT'S

02:22:43.021 --> 02:22:43.788
TIME FOR US TO GET THIS MASTER

02:22:43.855 --> 02:22:49.427
PLAN UPDATED AND SET IT ON A.

02:22:49.494 --> 02:22:52.630
ROUTINE UPDATING EVERY DECADE.

02:22:52.697 --> 02:22:53.765
SOMETHING. I MEAN, HELL, WE DO

02:22:53.831 --> 02:22:55.700
THE CENSUS EVERY TEN YEARS. CAN

02:22:55.767 --> 02:22:59.570
I SAY THAT? MY BAD. BUT THE IDEA

02:22:59.637 --> 02:23:01.706
IS THAT WE DO THE CENSUS EVERY

02:23:01.773 --> 02:23:03.541
YEAR. WHY CAN'T WE DO, I MEAN,

02:23:03.608 --> 02:23:04.943
EVERY YEAR, THE CENSUS EVERY TEN

02:23:05.009 --> 02:23:06.377
YEARS? WHY CAN'T WE DO SOMETHING

02:23:06.444 --> 02:23:09.213
LIKE THAT FOR THE MASTER PLAN?

02:23:09.280 --> 02:23:13.985
AND SO. I PREFER THE ORIGINAL

02:23:14.052 --> 02:23:15.453
VERSION THAT YOU HAD BEFORE THE

02:23:15.520 --> 02:23:16.688
COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS, BECAUSE

02:23:16.754 --> 02:23:18.389
IT'S WHAT YOUR COMMUNITY NEEDS,

02:23:18.456 --> 02:23:19.624
AND IT'S BECAUSE OF THIS

02:23:19.691 --> 02:23:20.792
OUTDATED MASTER PLAN THAT WE'RE

02:23:20.858 --> 02:23:22.961
TRYING THAT WE GO THROUGH THESE

02:23:23.027 --> 02:23:24.362
THINGS AGAIN, NO ONE'S FAULT BUT

02:23:24.429 --> 02:23:26.097
THE LEGISLATURE'S FAULT, AND WE

02:23:26.164 --> 02:23:29.467
JUST NEED TO FIX IT. AND SO, YOU

02:23:29.534 --> 02:23:31.569
KNOW WHAT YOUR COMMUNITY NEEDS.

02:23:31.636 --> 02:23:33.738
AND I KNOW IF I NEEDED SOMETHING

02:23:33.805 --> 02:23:35.106
THAT FOR MY COMMUNITY, I'D HOPE

02:23:35.173 --> 02:23:38.743
YOU TAKE MY WORD FOR IT, TOO. SO

02:23:38.810 --> 02:23:40.278
WITH THAT, MR. CHAIR, I'D LIKE

02:23:40.345 --> 02:23:42.413

NAME IS ALICIA NAGPAL, AND I'M

02:27:37.748 --> 02:27:40.117
HERE ON BEHALF OF THE STUDENT

02:27:40.184 --> 02:27:41.319
SENATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA

VOICE OF 2.1 MILLION STUDENTS IN

02:27:44.388 --> 02:27:46.891
STRONG SUPPORT OF SB 98. THIS

02:27:46.958 --> 02:27:48.659
BILL MATTERS BECAUSE

02:27:48.726 --> 02:27:49.627
UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS FROM

02:27:49.694 --> 02:27:50.761

DESERVE A SAFE AND STABLE

02:27:52.630 --> 02:27:54.065
EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT. AND

02:27:54.131 --> 02:27:55.800
RIGHT NOW, THEY DON'T HAVE THAT.

02:27:55.866 --> 02:27:57.168
IN JUST THE PAST MONTH,

02:27:57.235 --> 02:27:58.402
PRINCIPALS AND DISTRICT STAFF

02:27:58.469 --> 02:27:59.737
FROM TWO ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS IN

02:27:59.804 --> 02:28:01.572
LOS ANGELES REPORTED THAT

02:28:01.639 --> 02:28:02.940
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT AGENTS

02:28:03.007 --> 02:28:04.775
SHOWED UP WITHOUT FEDERAL

02:28:04.842 --> 02:28:06.244
WARRANTS, ATTEMPTING TO QUESTION

02:28:06.310 --> 02:28:07.044
STUDENTS AS YOUNG AS FIRST

02:28:07.111 --> 02:28:09.080
THROUGH FIFTH GRADE. CURRENTLY,

02:28:09.146 --> 02:28:10.581
THERE IS NO LAW REQUIRING

02:28:10.648 --> 02:28:11.983
NOTIFICATION TO PARENTS AT THE K

02:28:12.049 --> 02:28:13.417
THROUGH 12 LEVEL OR TO STUDENTS

02:28:13.484 --> 02:28:14.852
IN HIGHER EDUCATION WHEN

02:28:14.919 --> 02:28:16.020
IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS ARE

02:28:16.087 --> 02:28:17.788
PRESENT ON OR NEAR A SCHOOL

02:28:17.855 --> 02:28:19.924
CAMPUS. THIS LACK OF

02:28:19.991 --> 02:28:21.626
COMMUNICATION FOSTERS FEAR,

02:28:21.692 --> 02:28:22.793
CONFUSION, AND SILENCE,

02:28:22.860 --> 02:28:24.629
ESPECIALLY AMONG MIXED STATUS

02:28:24.695 --> 02:28:26.030
FAMILIES, UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS,

02:28:26.097 --> 02:28:28.266
AND STUDENT PARENTS. WE'RE

02:28:28.332 --> 02:28:29.267
ALREADY SEEING THE REAL IMPACTS

02:28:29.333 --> 02:28:31.502
OF THIS. PROFESSORS REPORT A

02:28:31.569 --> 02:28:34.071
SHARP DECLINE IN ATTENDANCE,

02:28:34.138 --> 02:28:35.706
ESPECIALLY IN ESL CLASSES. SOME

02:28:35.773 --> 02:28:37.541
HAVE EVEN MOVED INSTRUCTION BACK

02:28:37.608 --> 02:28:39.310
TO ZOOM, NOT FOR CONVENIENCE,

02:28:39.377 --> 02:28:40.344
BUT OUT OF CONCERN FOR THE

02:28:40.411 --> 02:28:43.347
SAFETY OF THEIR STUDENTS. SB 98

02:28:43.414 --> 02:28:44.982
IS A CRITICAL STEP TOWARD

02:28:45.049 --> 02:28:46.617
PROTECTING OUR STUDENTS AND

02:28:46.684 --> 02:28:48.386
UPHOLDING THE BASIC RIGHT TO

02:28:48.452 --> 02:28:49.620
EDUCATION. IT WOULD REQUIRE

02:28:49.687 --> 02:28:50.921
SCHOOLS TO NOTIFY PARENTS AT THE

02:28:50.988 --> 02:28:52.590
K THROUGH 12 LEVEL AND STUDENTS

02:28:52.657 --> 02:28:54.191
IN HIGHER EDUCATION. IF

02:28:54.258 --> 02:28:55.159
IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS ARE

02:28:55.226 --> 02:28:57.695
PRESENT ON CAMPUS BY ENSURING

02:28:57.762 --> 02:28:59.230
TRANSPARENCY, THIS BILL WOULD

02:28:59.297 --> 02:29:00.631
HELP ALLEVIATE FEAR, PROTECT OUR

02:29:00.698 --> 02:29:02.199
UNDOCUMENTED STUDENT POPULATION,

02:29:02.266 --> 02:29:03.868

02:36:09.359 --> 02:36:10.794
GOING FORWARD. I THINK IF YOU DO

02:36:10.861 --> 02:36:12.930
CARE ABOUT THESE KIDS, YOU WOULD

02:36:12.996 --> 02:36:14.732
WITHDRAW YOUR BILL AND YOU'D

02:36:14.798 --> 02:36:15.899
FOCUS ON SOMETHING ELSE THAT

02:36:15.966 --> 02:36:18.001
WOULD ACTUALLY BENEFIT KIDS AND

02:36:18.068 --> 02:36:19.069
BRING THESE KIDS TOGETHER AND

02:36:19.136 --> 02:36:20.704
BRING THEM THE LOVE AND THE

02:36:20.771 --> 02:36:22.239
SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED, NOT THE

02:36:22.306 --> 02:36:24.374
FEAR AND DIVISION THAT YOUR BILL

02:36:24.441 --> 02:36:25.909
REPRESENTS. WHICH WHICH LAW

02:36:25.976 --> 02:36:27.778
ENFORCEMENT AGENCY ARE WE GOING

02:36:27.845 --> 02:36:28.812
TO DEMONIZE TOMORROW? ARE WE

02:36:28.879 --> 02:36:30.681
GOING TO GO AFTER SOCIAL WORKERS

02:36:30.748 --> 02:36:33.217
WHO MIGHT BE OUT OF SCHOOL TO

02:36:33.283 --> 02:36:34.952
INVESTIGATE SEX ABUSE? SHOULD WE

02:36:35.018 --> 02:36:36.820
TELL ALL PARENTS THAT THERE WAS

02:36:36.887 --> 02:36:38.422
A SOCIAL WORKER THAT PAID A

02:36:38.489 --> 02:36:39.456
VISIT TO INVESTIGATE A CHILD

02:36:39.523 --> 02:36:41.792
BEING MOLESTED? PARENTS HAVE A

02:36:41.859 --> 02:36:43.827
RIGHT TO KNOW ABOUT THAT. BUT

02:36:43.894 --> 02:36:45.529
NO, WE DON'T DO THAT BECAUSE

02:36:45.596 --> 02:36:47.898
IT'S NOT PROPER, IT'S

02:36:47.965 --> 02:36:50.000
INFLAMMATORY, IT SPREADS FEAR,

02:36:50.067 --> 02:36:52.002
AND IT CERTAINLY IS NOT PROPER

02:36:52.069 --> 02:36:53.837
WHEN IT COMES TO THE ENFORCEMENT

02:36:53.904 --> 02:36:57.107
OF LAW AND INVESTIGATIONS.

02:36:57.174 --> 02:36:58.809
AGAIN, YOU GET TO DECIDE WHAT

02:36:58.876 --> 02:36:59.810
YOU'RE GOING TO DO WITH YOUR

02:36:59.877 --> 02:37:03.847
MAJORITY VOTES. BUT I WILL CALL

02:37:03.914 --> 02:37:05.816
IT OUT AS IT GOES THROUGH. MANY

02:37:05.883 --> 02:37:08.752
OTHER CALIFORNIANS WILL AS WELL.

02:37:08.819 --> 02:37:11.288
AND I SAY SHAME. THANK YOU. ANY

02:37:11.355 --> 02:37:13.957
FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS?

02:37:14.024 --> 02:37:14.625
CNN SENATOR, WE'D LIKE TO CLOSE,

02:37:14.691 --> 02:37:16.560
PLEASE. YEAH, CERTAINLY. I MEAN,

02:37:16.627 --> 02:37:18.162
ASSEMBLY MEMBER DEMAIO IS

02:37:18.228 --> 02:37:20.264
CERTAINLY ENTITLED TO HIS

02:37:20.330 --> 02:37:23.233
OPINION. AND CERTAINLY IF HE

02:37:23.300 --> 02:37:23.801
CARES ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT

02:37:23.867 --> 02:37:25.235
THAT'S HAPPENING IN K THROUGH 12

02:37:25.302 --> 02:37:27.271
SCHOOLS, I'D INVITE HIM TO

02:37:27.337 --> 02:37:29.039
COAUTHOR MY BILL, SB 848. THAT'S

02:37:29.106 --> 02:37:30.941
NOT RELATED TO THIS LEGISLATION

02:37:31.008 --> 02:37:33.577
THAT ADDRESSES MUCH OF THAT

02:37:33.644 --> 02:37:35.279
SITUATION. AND ALL OF THE

02:37:35.345 --> 02:37:36.547
HORRENDOUS CASES THAT WE'VE SEEN

02:37:36.613 --> 02:37:38.615
IN OUR K THROUGH 12 SCHOOLS.

02:37:38.682 --> 02:37:39.817
I'VE BEEN REALLY PROUD TO BE

02:37:39.883 --> 02:37:42.519
ABLE TO WORK ON SB 98 THAT IS IN

02:37:42.586 --> 02:37:44.721
PARTNERSHIP WITH REPUBLICANS AS

02:37:44.788 --> 02:37:46.557
WELL, AND HAVE BEEN REALLY

02:37:46.623 --> 02:37:47.991
PLEASED TO SEE THE BIPARTISAN

02:37:48.058 --> 02:37:49.526
SUPPORT THAT WE'VE EARNED ON

02:37:49.593 --> 02:37:51.895
THIS BILL. I UNDERSTAND THAT FOR

02:37:51.962 --> 02:37:53.764
ASSEMBLY MEMBER DEMAIO AND

02:37:53.831 --> 02:37:55.532
OTHERS WHO DON'T LIVE IN

02:37:55.599 --> 02:37:57.601
REALITY, THAT THEY MAY FEEL THAT

02:37:57.668 --> 02:38:01.004
THERE IS NOT ANY SORT OF

02:38:01.071 --> 02:38:03.106
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT PRESENCE

02:38:03.173 --> 02:38:04.374
NEAR THESE SCHOOLS, THAT IT'S

02:38:04.441 --> 02:38:07.044
NOT HAVING ANY SORT OF IMPACT ON

02:38:07.110 --> 02:38:08.912
CHILDREN, ON KIDS. BUT THE

02:38:08.979 --> 02:38:10.647
REALITY IS THAT IT IS THERE HAVE

02:38:10.714 --> 02:38:12.716
BEEN MULTIPLE REPORTS. THERE

02:38:12.783 --> 02:38:14.251
WERE TWO CONFIRMED REPORTS

02:38:14.318 --> 02:38:15.385
WITHIN LOS ANGELES UNIFIED

02:38:15.452 --> 02:38:17.487
SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT HAPPENED,

02:38:17.554 --> 02:38:18.789
TWO OF WHICH ACTUALLY HAPPENED

02:38:18.856 --> 02:38:22.125
THE DAY BEFORE. I PRESENTED ON

02:38:22.192 --> 02:38:25.062
THE FLOOR. IN ADDITION TO THAT,

02:38:25.128 --> 02:38:28.632
WE'VE ALSO HAD REPORTS COME FROM

02:38:28.699 --> 02:38:30.767
PEOPLE THAT WERE IMPERSONATING

02:38:30.834 --> 02:38:32.636
IMMIGRATION OFFICERS THAT TRIED

02:38:32.703 --> 02:38:34.905
TO ENTER A SCHOOL BUS. AND IT

02:38:34.972 --> 02:38:37.107
HAS BEEN VERY UNFORTUNATE THAT

02:38:37.174 --> 02:38:37.941
WE'VE SEEN THESE THINGS EVEN

02:38:38.008 --> 02:38:39.877
OCCUR IN TAKE PLACE WITHIN OUR K

02:38:39.943 --> 02:38:42.279
THROUGH 12 INSTITUTIONS. WE NEED

02:38:42.346 --> 02:38:44.648
TO SET UP A PROCESS FOR WARNING

02:38:44.715 --> 02:38:47.351
AND INFORMING PARENTS AND

02:38:47.417 --> 02:38:48.819
TEACHERS AND STUDENTS WHEN THESE

02:38:48.886 --> 02:38:51.388
EVENTS HAPPEN, AND THE VERY SAME

02:38:51.455 --> 02:38:53.023
WAY AND WITH THE SAME SYSTEMS

02:38:53.090 --> 02:38:55.259
THAT WE HAVE TO WARN PARENTS AND

02:38:55.325 --> 02:38:57.361
STUDENTS AND TEACHERS OF OTHER

02:38:57.427 --> 02:38:59.596
EVENTS, WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY

02:38:59.663 --> 02:39:01.465
ALREADY. AND TO SAY THAT WE

02:39:01.531 --> 02:39:04.334
DON'T WOULD JUST BE COMPLETELY

02:39:04.401 --> 02:39:06.036
INCORRECT. SO I'M REALLY EXCITED

02:39:06.103 --> 02:39:07.271
TO BE COAUTHORING THIS AND

02:39:07.337 --> 02:39:08.639
REALLY WANT TO HONOR THE

02:39:08.705 --> 02:39:10.173
STUDENTS THAT ARE SITTING NEXT

02:39:10.240 --> 02:39:11.642
TO ME THAT HELPED WITH CRAFTING

02:39:11.708 --> 02:39:13.677
THIS AND MOVING THIS LEGISLATION

02:39:13.744 --> 02:39:16.580
FORWARD. I THINK THAT THEY HAVE

02:39:16.647 --> 02:39:19.116
REALLY PUT A LOT INTO THIS BILL,

02:39:19.182 --> 02:39:20.550
AND REALLY, IT'S THEIR

02:39:20.617 --> 02:39:21.752
BRILLIANCE THAT HELPED TO BRING

02:39:21.818 --> 02:39:24.154
THIS FORWARD. SO FOR THE SAKE OF

02:39:24.221 --> 02:39:26.256
NOT JUST STUDENTS, BUT PARENTS

02:39:26.323 --> 02:39:27.791
AND TEACHERS, I THINK ALL ACROSS

02:39:27.858 --> 02:39:29.459
THE STATE WHO HAVE THE RIGHT TO

02:39:29.526 --> 02:39:31.695
KNOW WHEN THESE EVENTS ARE

02:39:31.762 --> 02:39:33.864
HAPPENING ON CAMPUS. I THINK WE

02:39:33.931 --> 02:39:35.966
NEED TO WE NEED TO PASS AND

02:39:36.033 --> 02:39:37.501
IMPLEMENT THIS LAW AS QUICKLY AS

02:39:37.567 --> 02:39:38.568
POSSIBLE. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE

02:39:38.635 --> 02:39:40.270
URGENCY LANGUAGE IN IT. SO

02:39:40.337 --> 02:39:41.872
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

02:39:41.939 --> 02:39:44.374

02:41:48.832 --> 02:41:50.567
CSAC AND THE HIGHER EDUCATION

02:41:50.634 --> 02:41:52.903

THEIR APPLICATIONS. WHILE

02:42:44.721 --> 02:42:46.723
SEEMINGLY WELL-INTENDED, THESE

02:42:46.790 --> 02:42:47.958
OVERHAULING CHANGES HAVE CAUSED

02:42:48.024 --> 02:42:49.926
A MYRIAD OF TECHNICAL ISSUES,

02:42:49.993 --> 02:42:51.528
SOME OF WHICH I'M SURE YOU HEARD

02:42:51.595 --> 02:42:53.363
FROM YOUR VERY DISTRICTS OVER

02:42:53.430 --> 02:42:54.898
THE LAST YEAR. I KNOW, CERTAINLY

02:42:54.965 --> 02:42:56.766
I HAD TO WORK WITH A LOT OF HIGH

02:42:56.833 --> 02:42:58.068
SCHOOL STUDENTS AND ASSISTING

02:42:58.135 --> 02:43:00.070
THEM WITH COMPLETING THEIR FAFSA

02:43:00.137 --> 02:43:02.873
AND RAISED NEW PRIVACY CONCERNS

02:43:02.939 --> 02:43:03.507
FOR FAFSA ELIGIBLE STUDENTS AND

02:43:03.573 --> 02:43:06.610
THEIR FAMILIES. IN ADDITION TO

02:43:06.676 --> 02:43:08.278
THESE TECHNICAL ISSUES,

02:43:08.345 --> 02:43:09.179

02:43:18.522 --> 02:43:21.191
THE UNCLEAR FUTURE OF THE U.S.

DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, AS WELL

02:43:22.092 --> 02:43:23.727
AS THE UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS OF

DATA SHARING BETWEEN FEDERAL

02:43:25.595 --> 02:43:28.064

02:43:28.131 --> 02:43:29.900
FOR FAMILIES AS COLLEGE BOUND

02:43:29.966 --> 02:43:31.868
STUDENTS AND FAMILIES DELIBERATE

02:43:31.935 --> 02:43:33.770
AND MAY BECOME DISSUADED FROM

PURSUING COLLEGE BECAUSE OF WHAT

02:43:35.138 --> 02:43:36.806
MAY BE HAPPENING WITH THE

02:43:36.873 --> 02:43:38.608
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, IT IS

02:43:38.675 --> 02:43:39.943
INCUMBENT. WE PROVIDE CALIFORNIA

02:43:40.010 --> 02:43:41.711
COLLEGE BOUND STUDENTS WITH A

02:43:41.778 --> 02:43:44.414
STABLE, SAFE AND ALTERNATIVE

02:43:44.481 --> 02:43:46.416
STATE BASED FINANCIAL AID

02:43:46.483 --> 02:43:48.285
APPLICATION TO FEEL SAFE IN

APPLYING FOR FINANCIAL AID AND

02:43:49.386 --> 02:43:51.421
CHOOSING TO GO TO COLLEGE. WE

02:43:51.488 --> 02:43:53.290
CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE A

02:43:53.356 --> 02:43:54.057
GENERATION OF STUDENTS, AND

02:43:54.124 --> 02:43:55.492
THAT'S WHY I INTRODUCED THIS

02:43:55.559 --> 02:43:57.394
MEASURE WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY

02:43:57.460 --> 02:44:00.497
IN SUPPORT OF SB 323 TODAY ARE

02:44:00.564 --> 02:44:02.666
ALEX ZUKO, STATE AND FEDERAL

02:44:02.732 --> 02:44:04.601
POLICY MANAGER AT THE CALIFORNIA

02:44:04.668 --> 02:44:05.869
STUDENT AID COMMISSION, AND

02:44:05.936 --> 02:44:07.704
KEVIN BIBBIANO WITH THE UC

02:44:07.771 --> 02:44:09.773
STUDENT ASSOCIATION. AT THE

02:44:09.839 --> 02:44:10.840
APPROPRIATE TIME, I ASK FOR YOUR

02:44:10.907 --> 02:44:13.076
VOTE. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

02:44:13.143 --> 02:44:14.878
WELCOME. THANK YOU. GOOD

02:44:14.945 --> 02:44:16.179
AFTERNOON. I'M ALEX ZUKO FROM

02:44:16.246 --> 02:44:17.480
THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION, AND

02:44:17.547 --> 02:44:19.849
I'M HERE TO GIVE A PRESENTATION

02:44:19.916 --> 02:44:21.851
ON THREE, TWO, THREE, AS WELL AS

02:44:21.918 --> 02:44:22.452
ANSWERING TECHNICAL QUESTIONS

02:44:22.519 --> 02:44:23.853
ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT

02:44:23.920 --> 02:44:25.355
APPLICATION. SHOULD YOU HAVE ANY?

02:44:25.422 --> 02:44:27.624
AFTER, AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED,

02:44:27.691 --> 02:44:29.926
THE 2020 BETTER FAFSA

02:44:29.993 --> 02:44:31.761
APPLICATION ROLLOUT WAS NOT A

02:44:31.828 --> 02:44:35.031
HUGE SUCCESS. THERE WAS A FEW

02:44:35.098 --> 02:44:36.800
GLITCHES, A FEW OF THEM BEING

02:44:36.866 --> 02:44:38.969
THAT TECHNICALLY IT BECAME NEAR

02:44:39.035 --> 02:44:40.437
IMPOSSIBLE FOR STUDENTS THAT HAD

02:44:40.503 --> 02:44:42.372
ONE OR MORE PARENTS OR SPOUSE

02:44:42.439 --> 02:44:43.607
THAT DID NOT HAVE A SOCIAL

02:44:43.673 --> 02:44:45.275
SECURITY NUMBER FROM COMPLETING

02:44:45.342 --> 02:44:46.743
THE APPLICATION. SO DURING THOSE

02:44:46.810 --> 02:44:47.744
TWO YEARS, THE PRIOR TWO YEARS,

02:44:47.811 --> 02:44:49.779
THIS ONE INCLUDED, WE ALLOWED

02:44:49.846 --> 02:44:51.147
MIXED STATUS FAMILIES OR

02:44:51.214 --> 02:44:53.817
STUDENTS THAT HAD THAT CONDITION

02:44:53.883 --> 02:44:56.019
TO APPLY AND USE THE KEDA THAT

02:44:56.086 --> 02:44:58.054
GAVE THEM THE ON RAMP TO THE CAL

02:44:58.121 --> 02:45:00.824
GRANT. THAT IS NOT A NEW BUCKET

02:45:00.890 --> 02:45:01.691
OF MONEY. THERE'S NOT CAÑADA

02:45:01.758 --> 02:45:02.792
MONEY AND CAL GRANT MONEY. THERE

02:45:02.859 --> 02:45:04.561
IS JUST ONE BUCKET OF MONEY, AND

02:45:04.628 --> 02:45:07.030
THE FAFSA AND THE KEDA ARE THOSE

02:45:07.097 --> 02:45:09.733
ON RAMPS TO THE MONEY. SO WE ARE

02:45:09.799 --> 02:45:11.301
JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:45:11.368 --> 02:45:11.835
ALL THE STUDENTS THAT ARE

02:45:11.901 --> 02:45:13.737
ELIGIBLE FOR CALIFORNIA AID HAVE

02:45:13.803 --> 02:45:14.838
THE RIGHT ON RAMP. I IMAGINE YOU

02:45:14.904 --> 02:45:16.640
ALL WANT TO GO TO DISNEYLAND.

02:45:16.706 --> 02:45:18.642
YOU GOT TO GET ON THE RIGHT

02:45:18.708 --> 02:45:20.844
FREEWAY, AND IT'S NOT THE 605.

02:45:20.910 --> 02:45:21.678
BUT HOWEVER, WE DID HAVE A

02:45:21.745 --> 02:45:22.612
FURTHER ENVIRONMENT IN THE

02:45:22.679 --> 02:45:23.747
FEDERAL ATMOSPHERE THAT DOES

02:45:23.813 --> 02:45:26.316
GIVE US THE LANDSCAPE OF

02:45:26.383 --> 02:45:27.183
STUDENTS BEING NOW A LITTLE

02:45:27.250 --> 02:45:28.385
NERVOUS WITH SOME DATA SHARING

02:45:28.451 --> 02:45:31.488
AGREEMENTS THAT ARE NEW TO A LOT

02:45:31.554 --> 02:45:33.957
OF PEOPLE. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:45:34.024 --> 02:45:35.091
THAT WHILE THEY'RE STILL HAVING

02:45:35.158 --> 02:45:35.692
THOSE KIND OF CONVERSATIONS,

02:45:35.759 --> 02:45:36.693
BECAUSE A COLLEGE DECISION FOR

02:45:36.760 --> 02:45:38.395
AN ENTIRE FAMILY IS A HUGE ONE,

02:45:38.461 --> 02:45:40.263
THAT THEY ALL ARE MAKING THE

02:45:40.330 --> 02:45:41.665
DECISIONS BASED ON OPTIONS AND

02:45:41.731 --> 02:45:43.867
NOT ON WHAT IS JUST LEFT AND

02:45:43.933 --> 02:45:46.036
WHAT IS PRESCRIBED. WE WANT TO

02:45:46.102 --> 02:45:47.504
MITIGATE THAT THOSE CHALLENGES,

02:45:47.570 --> 02:45:49.606
BY ALLOWING ANYBODY IN

02:45:49.673 --> 02:45:51.074
CALIFORNIA THAT IS ELIGIBLE FOR

02:45:51.141 --> 02:45:53.476
CALIFORNIA AID TO APPLY FOR THE

02:45:53.543 --> 02:45:56.313
KEDA AND GET THAT ON RAMP TO CAL

02:45:56.379 --> 02:45:58.648
GRANT, THIS IS NOT ALSO THEN

02:45:58.715 --> 02:46:00.183
GIVE THEM ACCESS TO FEDERAL AID.

02:46:00.250 --> 02:46:01.618
AND THAT IS ACTUALLY PART OF ONE

02:46:01.685 --> 02:46:03.520
OF THE AMENDMENTS IS WE'LL BE

02:46:03.586 --> 02:46:04.888
TAKING THAT. WE WANT TO MAKE

02:46:04.954 --> 02:46:06.856
SURE STUDENTS KNOW IT IS ALREADY

02:46:06.923 --> 02:46:08.291
WRITTEN ON THE CALIFORNIA DREAM

02:46:08.358 --> 02:46:09.092
ACT APPLICATION. THIS YOU DO

02:46:09.159 --> 02:46:10.760
FORGO FEDERAL AID. SO THIS IS

02:46:10.827 --> 02:46:11.961
NOT SOMETHING THAT IS NEW, BUT

02:46:12.028 --> 02:46:14.431
WE WANT TO HAVE MORE BECAUSE IT

02:46:14.497 --> 02:46:16.900
IS IT IS A BIG LOSS. IT

02:46:16.966 --> 02:46:18.702
ADDRESSES THE CONFUSION IN THE

02:46:18.768 --> 02:46:21.604
APPLICATIONS WE WANT TO HAVE THE

02:46:21.671 --> 02:46:23.173
HAVE IT AVAILABLE, REGARDLESS OF

02:46:23.239 --> 02:46:24.507
THEIR ELIGIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL

02:46:24.574 --> 02:46:25.875
AID. IT RESPONDS TO THE

02:46:25.942 --> 02:46:27.344
CHALLENGES OF THE FAFSA ROLLOUT,

02:46:27.410 --> 02:46:28.778
AS WELL AS SOME OF THE

02:46:28.845 --> 02:46:30.747
INSECURITIES OF WHAT MIGHT BE

02:46:30.814 --> 02:46:32.315
HAPPENING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

02:46:32.382 --> 02:46:32.816
WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:46:32.882 --> 02:46:33.917
EDUCATION, THERE COULD BE A

02:46:33.983 --> 02:46:34.751
SITUATION WHERE THE DEPARTMENT

02:46:34.818 --> 02:46:36.820
OF EDUCATION DOES NO LONGER

02:46:36.886 --> 02:46:38.588
EXIST. AND MAYBE THEY SAY EVERY

02:46:38.655 --> 02:46:39.989
STATE MUST ADMINISTER PELL ON

02:46:40.056 --> 02:46:41.558
THEIR OWN. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO

02:46:41.624 --> 02:46:43.560
DO THAT? WELL, WE ALREADY HAVE

02:46:43.626 --> 02:46:44.894
THE CALIFORNIA DREAM APPLICATION

02:46:44.961 --> 02:46:46.363
TO DO THAT. THIS GIVES US THAT

02:46:46.429 --> 02:46:50.333
ON RAMP. OH I'M SORRY. PLEASE

02:46:50.400 --> 02:46:54.037
PROCEED. LASTLY, THIS DOES NOT

02:46:54.104 --> 02:46:55.305
PROHIBIT FAFSA ELIGIBLE STUDENTS

02:46:55.372 --> 02:46:56.973
FROM APPLYING FOR FAFSA. THIS

02:46:57.040 --> 02:46:58.875
WOULD ALLOW THEM TO IF STUDENTS

02:46:58.942 --> 02:47:00.610
DO START OUT WITH THE K TO

02:47:00.677 --> 02:47:01.978
PROCESS, AND THEN THEY DECIDE

02:47:02.045 --> 02:47:02.679
HALFWAY THROUGH LIKE, HEY,

02:47:02.746 --> 02:47:04.547
EVERYTHING IS HUNKY DORY

02:47:04.614 --> 02:47:05.648
EVERYWHERE, I'M GOING TO APPLY

02:47:05.715 --> 02:47:07.317
FOR THE FAFSA. THEY ABSOLUTELY

02:47:07.384 --> 02:47:09.452
CAN DO THAT AND THAT WE MATCH IT

02:47:09.519 --> 02:47:11.154
UP ON THE BACK END. THE STUDENTS

02:47:11.221 --> 02:47:12.856
SEAMLESS, SEAMLESS FOR THE

02:47:12.922 --> 02:47:14.057
STUDENTS. AND THERE'S ONLY STILL

02:47:14.124 --> 02:47:16.059
AGAIN, ONE BUCKET OF MONEY DOES

02:47:16.126 --> 02:47:18.695
NOT GET EXTRA MONEY. PLEASE VOTE

02:47:18.762 --> 02:47:20.497
YES. AND THAT'S ALL I HAVE.

02:47:20.563 --> 02:47:22.232

TO STUDENTS FROM MIXED STATUS

02:47:54.597 --> 02:47:55.265
BACKGROUNDS. THIS EFFORT TO

02:47:55.331 --> 02:47:56.599
MITIGATE THE GAP AND STUDENTS

02:47:56.666 --> 02:47:57.700
WHOSE APPLICATIONS ARE IN LIMBO

02:47:57.767 --> 02:48:00.270
PERTAINS TO SB 323 HIGH SCHOOL

02:48:00.336 --> 02:48:01.337

COLLEGE STUDENTS CONTINUE TO

02:48:02.572 --> 02:48:03.840
FACE CHALLENGES RESULTING FROM

02:48:03.907 --> 02:48:06.075
THE FAFSA. IN PARTICULAR, MANY

02:48:06.142 --> 02:48:07.477
ARE STILL WORRIED ABOUT THE

02:48:07.544 --> 02:48:08.978
POTENTIAL RISK TO THEIR LOVED

02:48:09.045 --> 02:48:09.979
ONES, EVEN AFTER OVERCOMING THE

02:48:10.046 --> 02:48:11.047
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES WITH THE

02:48:11.114 --> 02:48:12.749
FORM. AS A LOW INCOME STUDENT

02:48:12.816 --> 02:48:14.083
FROM A MIXED STATUS FAMILY

02:48:14.150 --> 02:48:15.785
MYSELF, I ALSO HAD TO NAVIGATE

02:48:15.852 --> 02:48:17.620
THESE BARRIERS. AT ITS BEST, THE

02:48:17.687 --> 02:48:18.721
FAFSA DELIVERS AID THROUGH AN

02:48:18.788 --> 02:48:20.089
INEFFICIENT AND INEQUITABLE

02:48:20.156 --> 02:48:21.624
PROCESS. AT ITS WORST, IT

02:48:21.691 --> 02:48:23.059
REMAINS A FEDERAL ASSET WITH

02:48:23.126 --> 02:48:23.660
SENSITIVE INFORMATION, WHICH

02:48:23.726 --> 02:48:25.395
MANY FEAR UNDER THE CURRENT

02:48:25.462 --> 02:48:26.830
NATIONAL CLIMATE IS VULNERABLE

02:48:26.896 --> 02:48:28.865
TO FEDERAL MISUSE. THANKFULLY,

02:48:28.932 --> 02:48:30.133
THE CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT

02:48:30.200 --> 02:48:31.134
APPLICATION HAS PROVIDED AN

02:48:31.201 --> 02:48:32.035
ALTERNATIVE WAY FOR STUDENTS

02:48:32.101 --> 02:48:33.570
FROM MIXED STATUS FAMILIES WHO

02:48:33.636 --> 02:48:35.972
WERE HIT HARDEST BY THE FAFSA TO

02:48:36.039 --> 02:48:36.673
ENSURE THEIR CONSIDERATION FOR

02:48:36.739 --> 02:48:38.708
STATE AND INSTITUTIONAL AID.

02:48:38.775 --> 02:48:40.210
LIKE SO MANY CALIFORNIA

02:48:40.276 --> 02:48:41.711
STUDENTS, MY DREAM OF A COLLEGE

02:48:41.778 --> 02:48:42.412
DEGREE WOULD HAVE BEEN

02:48:42.479 --> 02:48:42.979
IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT FINANCIAL

02:48:43.046 --> 02:48:44.514
AID. THAT'S WHY IT'S CRITICAL

02:48:44.581 --> 02:48:45.715
THAT STATE LAW CLEARLY OUTLINES

02:48:45.782 --> 02:48:47.317
THE CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT

02:48:47.383 --> 02:48:49.285
APPLICATION AS AN OPTION FOR

02:48:49.352 --> 02:48:49.853
CALIFORNIANS, REGARDLESS OF

02:48:49.919 --> 02:48:51.087
THEIR ELIGIBILITY FOR FEDERAL

02:48:51.154 --> 02:48:53.156
AID. STUDENTS WHO ARE UNABLE OR

02:48:53.223 --> 02:48:54.324
UNCERTAIN ABOUT SUBMITTING A

02:48:54.390 --> 02:48:56.359
FAFSA NOW OR IN THE FUTURE

02:48:56.426 --> 02:48:57.494
DESERVE THIS STATE LEVEL

02:48:57.560 --> 02:48:59.295
ALTERNATIVE. SUCH A GUARANTEE

02:48:59.362 --> 02:49:00.530
ENSURES STUDENTS DON'T HAVE TO

02:49:00.597 --> 02:49:02.131
MAKE IMPOSSIBLE CHOICES, BUT CAN

02:49:02.198 --> 02:49:03.199
MAKE INFORMED ONES ABOUT THEIR

02:49:03.266 --> 02:49:05.502
ABILITY TO APPLY FOR ASSISTANCE.

02:49:05.568 --> 02:49:07.136
SB 323 IS ABOUT OPTIONS,

02:49:07.203 --> 02:49:08.104
PROTECTING SENSITIVE INFORMATION

02:49:08.171 --> 02:49:09.405
AND EMPOWERING CALIFORNIA

02:49:09.472 --> 02:49:11.140
STUDENTS AND FAMILIES TO DECIDE

CLARIFYING QUESTIONS SO I CAN

02:51:39.522 --> 02:51:40.890
UNDERSTAND THIS A LITTLE BIT

02:51:40.957 --> 02:51:45.161
BETTER. SO PRIOR TO THE

02:51:45.228 --> 02:51:47.030
CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT WAS

02:51:47.096 --> 02:51:48.431
SPECIFICALLY FOR UNDOCUMENTED

02:51:48.498 --> 02:51:50.967

02:51:51.034 --> 02:51:54.303
IS CORRECT. ANY DOCUMENTED

02:51:54.370 --> 02:51:55.238
UNDOCUMENTED DOESN'T MATTER CAN

02:51:55.304 --> 02:51:57.840
APPLY FOR THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL

02:51:57.907 --> 02:51:58.808
IS SAYING. YES. CAN APPLY FOR

02:51:58.875 --> 02:52:00.777
IT. IT IS IT IS ALLOWING OPEN

02:52:00.843 --> 02:52:02.578
ACCESS TO ANYBODY TO BE ABLE TO

02:52:02.645 --> 02:52:06.082
UTILIZE THE APPLICATION. AND IN

02:52:06.149 --> 02:52:07.950
THE CASE AS YOU HEARD US

02:52:08.017 --> 02:52:09.786
DESCRIBE BEFORE, I'M NOT SURE

02:52:09.852 --> 02:52:11.521
WHERE YOU BEGAN YOUR TIME IN

02:52:11.587 --> 02:52:12.922
GOVERNMENT IF YOU STARTED IN

02:52:12.989 --> 02:52:13.556
LOCAL GOVERNMENT. BUT OVER THE

02:52:13.623 --> 02:52:16.225
LAST COUPLE DECEMBER 6TH, OKAY.

02:52:16.292 --> 02:52:19.462
THAT'S HELPFUL TO KNOW. I YOU

02:52:19.529 --> 02:52:21.064
KNOW, I WAS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT

02:52:21.130 --> 02:52:23.833
BEFORE THIS AND THERE WERE A LOT

02:52:23.900 --> 02:52:25.935
OF ISSUES WITH THE ROLLOUT OF

02:52:26.002 --> 02:52:28.771
THE NEW FAFSA APPLICATION,

02:52:28.838 --> 02:52:32.141
PARTICULARLY AS AS WAS

02:52:32.208 --> 02:52:34.544
MENTIONED. YES. AND SO THAT WAS

02:52:34.610 --> 02:52:36.813
A THAT WAS PART OF THE CHALLENGE

02:52:36.879 --> 02:52:38.815
THAT FOLKS FACED. IF THEY HAD A

02:52:38.881 --> 02:52:41.417
PARENT THAT HAD AN ITIN NUMBER

02:52:41.484 --> 02:52:43.186
AND THAT CAUSED HUGE DELAYS,

02:52:43.252 --> 02:52:44.687
EVEN SAU MEMBERS OF THE

02:52:44.754 --> 02:52:45.555
LEGISLATURE, INCLUDING SOME OF

02:52:45.621 --> 02:52:47.023
YOUR NEIGHBORING COLLEAGUES,

02:52:47.090 --> 02:52:48.958
MOVED LEGISLATION TO DELAY THAT

02:52:49.025 --> 02:52:50.727
DEADLINE FOR COMPLETING THE

02:52:50.793 --> 02:52:52.628
FAFSA. SO THIS OPENS IT UP SO

02:52:52.695 --> 02:52:54.397
THAT ANYBODY MAY BE ABLE TO

02:52:54.464 --> 02:52:56.265
UTILIZE IT. WE'RE HOPING THAT WE

02:52:56.332 --> 02:52:57.600
GET THIS FAST. A SITUATION

02:52:57.667 --> 02:53:00.470
CLEANED UP THIS YEAR. IF THE

02:53:00.536 --> 02:53:01.571
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, WHICH

02:53:01.637 --> 02:53:03.272
WE KNOW IS BEING ELIMINATED,

02:53:03.339 --> 02:53:04.540
DECIDES THAT THEY WANT TO MOVE

02:53:04.607 --> 02:53:05.775
FORWARD WITH SOMETHING NEW OR

02:53:05.842 --> 02:53:07.910
ELIMINATE IT, THAT ALLOWS

02:53:07.977 --> 02:53:10.446
ANYBODY TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE

02:53:10.513 --> 02:53:12.782
IT. I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY A

02:53:12.849 --> 02:53:17.553
COUPLE PIECES IN THIS FOR MY OWN

02:53:17.620 --> 02:53:19.288
DISTRICT AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE

02:53:19.355 --> 02:53:22.692
WHO ARE WATCHING. SO IT'S

02:53:22.759 --> 02:53:28.264
ILLEGAL FOR FAFSA TO RELEASE.

02:53:28.331 --> 02:53:31.601
CITIZENSHIP INFORMATION. WHICH

02:53:31.667 --> 02:53:34.604
OR ELIGIBLE NON CITIZENSHIP. SO

02:53:34.670 --> 02:53:37.907
WE KNOW THAT BY THE WAY I LIKE

02:53:37.974 --> 02:53:40.443
THIS. SO DON'T DON'T ATTACK

02:53:40.510 --> 02:53:44.747
OKAY. BECAUSE THERE'S SOME

02:53:44.814 --> 02:53:45.882
MISINFORMATION OUT THERE RIGHT.

02:53:45.948 --> 02:53:46.883
AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:53:46.949 --> 02:53:49.118
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S YOU

02:53:49.185 --> 02:53:50.920
KNOW IT'S ILLEGAL TO TALK ABOUT

02:53:50.987 --> 02:53:54.824
CITIZENSHIP STATUS NUMBER TWO.

02:53:54.891 --> 02:53:56.626
THE FAFSA FORM DOES NOT ASK

02:53:56.692 --> 02:53:59.228
ABOUT A PARENT'S CITIZENSHIP. MY

02:53:59.295 --> 02:54:03.099
CONCERN, I GUESS, IS A IS A

02:54:03.166 --> 02:54:05.334
MIXED STATUS AND HOW THAT'S

02:54:05.401 --> 02:54:08.171
GOING TO WORK, THAT'S DOWN THE

02:54:08.237 --> 02:54:10.573
LINE BECAUSE ONE COULD BE

02:54:10.640 --> 02:54:12.041
DOCUMENTED, ONE COULD BE

02:54:12.108 --> 02:54:13.576
UNDOCUMENTED. WHERE DOES FAFSA

02:54:13.643 --> 02:54:15.678
LOOK IF THERE'S NO ITIN. SO I

02:54:15.745 --> 02:54:18.080
THINK THERE'S SOME THERE MIGHT

02:54:18.147 --> 02:54:20.049
BE SOME ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES TO

02:54:20.116 --> 02:54:22.618
SORT OUT WITHIN THIS DOWN THE

02:54:22.685 --> 02:54:25.555
ROAD ON ON SPECIFIC. AND I DON'T

02:54:25.621 --> 02:54:26.789
KNOW IF IT HAS BEEN SORTED OUT

02:54:26.856 --> 02:54:28.958
BY THE WAY. I'M JUST FORESEEING

02:54:29.025 --> 02:54:30.593
IT HAS NOT BEEN SORTED OUT. SO

02:54:30.660 --> 02:54:34.430
IF THERE'S A MIXED STATUS PARENT

02:54:34.497 --> 02:54:38.167
AND SOMEONE WANTS TO GO WITH

02:54:38.234 --> 02:54:40.837
WITH THE CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT,

02:54:40.903 --> 02:54:46.409
BUT THERE IS NO ITIN. THEY CAN'T

02:54:46.475 --> 02:54:49.679
GO WITH FAFSA, THEY COULD STILL

02:54:49.745 --> 02:54:51.480
GO WITH CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT.

02:54:51.547 --> 02:54:54.150
RIGHT? AND YOU HAVE TO PICK ONE,

02:54:54.217 --> 02:54:55.785
ONE OR THE OTHER. YOU HAVE TO.

02:54:55.852 --> 02:54:57.353
YOU CAN'T USE BOTH. YOU WANT TO

02:54:57.420 --> 02:54:59.288
GO AHEAD AND EXPAND, CORRECT?

02:54:59.355 --> 02:55:00.456
YEAH. YOU CAN'T. YOU HAVE TO

02:55:00.523 --> 02:55:02.892
BECAUSE SO FIRST, ON THE FIRST

02:55:02.959 --> 02:55:03.993
POINT, WHILE FAFSA IS NOT

02:55:04.060 --> 02:55:06.762
SHARING INFORMATION YET WITH

02:55:06.829 --> 02:55:09.298
ICE, THE IRS IS GOING TO AND

02:55:09.365 --> 02:55:11.601
YOUR IRS INFORMATION IS NOW HARD

02:55:11.667 --> 02:55:13.102
CODED INTO YOUR FAFSA. AND THAT

02:55:13.169 --> 02:55:15.204
IS WHY THAT IS WHAT THE FAFSA

02:55:15.271 --> 02:55:17.373
WAS DOING. SO THAT IS THAT'S

02:55:17.440 --> 02:55:18.574
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME DON'T MAKE

02:55:18.641 --> 02:55:20.676
ME A NO. LET'S JUST LET'S JUST

02:55:20.743 --> 02:55:22.411
STICK TO THE QUESTION. AND

02:55:22.478 --> 02:55:23.446
THAT'S THAT'S FEDERAL. THAT'S

02:55:23.512 --> 02:55:24.981
NOT US. BUT LET'S STICK TO THIS

02:55:25.047 --> 02:55:27.316
PART FOR THE I-10. THAT'S NO

02:55:27.383 --> 02:55:28.751
LONGER THAT'S NOT NO LONGER A

02:55:28.818 --> 02:55:30.620
NUMBER YOU CAN USE IN FAFSA. SO

02:55:30.686 --> 02:55:31.988
THAT'S WHERE THE PARENTS WERE

02:55:32.054 --> 02:55:34.223
GETTING BLOCKED OUT. BUT YOU

02:55:34.290 --> 02:55:35.291
HAVE A DIFFERENT IDENTIFYING

02:55:35.358 --> 02:55:37.026
NUMBER IN CALIFORNIA. SO THE

02:55:37.093 --> 02:55:38.861
PARENTS THAT IF A STUDENT IS

02:55:38.928 --> 02:55:41.030
APPLYING FOR KEDAH, THEIR

02:55:41.097 --> 02:55:42.531
PARENTS CAN USE THEIR

02:55:42.598 --> 02:55:43.666
IDENTIFYING NUMBERS IN

02:55:43.733 --> 02:55:45.034
CALIFORNIA TO APPLY FOR KEDAH TO

02:55:45.101 --> 02:55:46.969
GET TO THE CAL GRANT. IT'S NOT

02:55:47.036 --> 02:55:48.771
GETTING THEM TO FEDERAL MONEY.

02:55:48.838 --> 02:55:53.209
NO, I GOT THE MONEY. THE I

02:55:53.276 --> 02:55:54.710
UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THAT

02:55:54.777 --> 02:55:57.179
PORTION AND I UNDERSTAND THE

02:55:57.246 --> 02:55:59.048
POTENTIALS THAT ARE OUT THERE.

02:55:59.115 --> 02:56:01.250
AND TRUST ME, I'VE SEEN A

02:56:01.317 --> 02:56:03.386
MILLION HYPOTHETICAL SITUATIONS

02:56:03.452 --> 02:56:04.954
AND I APPRECIATE THE THINKING,

02:56:05.021 --> 02:56:06.322
THE FORESIGHT OF SAYING, OKAY,

02:56:06.389 --> 02:56:08.357
IF THIS DOES HAPPEN, WE HAVE A

02:56:08.424 --> 02:56:09.959
PLAN IN PLACE. I'M I'M GOOD WITH

02:56:10.026 --> 02:56:13.029
THAT. THAT PORTION OF IT. WHAT I

02:56:13.095 --> 02:56:17.900
JUST WOULD. WHAT I WOULD WANT TO

02:56:17.967 --> 02:56:21.370
CLARIFY FOR THOSE WHO ARE THE

02:56:21.437 --> 02:56:22.738
PARENTS WHO ARE LISTENING AND

02:56:22.805 --> 02:56:24.774
WATCHING OUT THERE IS UNDERSTAND

02:56:24.840 --> 02:56:26.776
WHAT YOUR RIGHTS ARE, UNDERSTAND

02:56:26.842 --> 02:56:29.278
WHAT FAFSA IS, UNDERSTAND WHAT

02:56:29.345 --> 02:56:31.080
KEDAH IS, UNDERSTAND THAT YOU

02:56:31.147 --> 02:56:32.515
CAN'T HAVE BOTH, RIGHT? BECAUSE

02:56:32.581 --> 02:56:33.849
THAT WILL BE THE QUESTION, WHY

02:56:33.916 --> 02:56:35.785
CAN'T I GET BOTH? AND WE'VE ALSO

02:56:35.851 --> 02:56:38.287
IN THE BILL HAVE MADE LANGUAGE

02:56:38.354 --> 02:56:40.022
CLARIFYING THAT AS SOMEBODY

02:56:40.089 --> 02:56:41.524
COMPLETING THE KEDAH

02:56:41.590 --> 02:56:42.992
APPLICATION, THAT THEY WILL BE

02:56:43.059 --> 02:56:44.160
INFORMED THAT THEY CANNOT ALSO

02:56:44.226 --> 02:56:45.828
DO A FAFSA BECAUSE YOU CANNOT

02:56:45.895 --> 02:56:47.063
COMPLETE BOTH APPLICATIONS.

02:56:47.129 --> 02:56:48.164
THAT'S ACTUALLY INFORMATION

02:56:48.230 --> 02:56:50.099
THAT'S ALREADY INCLUDED IN THE

02:56:50.166 --> 02:56:51.667
APPLICATION. HOW DOES THAT CROSS

02:56:51.734 --> 02:56:53.369
TRIGGER? BECAUSE BECAUSE I KNOW

02:56:53.436 --> 02:56:56.706
WHEN I WHEN WE DID IT FOR MY SON

02:56:56.772 --> 02:56:57.807
JUST A YEAR AGO ACTUALLY LESS

02:56:57.873 --> 02:56:59.175
THAN THAT, WE'RE IN THERE AND

02:56:59.241 --> 02:57:01.310
WE'RE DOING THAT. WHAT IS IT IN

02:57:01.377 --> 02:57:04.547
THERE THAT WILL STOP ME, THE

02:57:04.613 --> 02:57:07.817
PARENT IN CALIFORNIA, FROM

02:57:07.883 --> 02:57:11.520
COMPLETING THE FORM OUT? AND HOW

02:57:11.587 --> 02:57:13.189
DOES FAFSA KNOW THAT THE KEDAH

02:57:13.255 --> 02:57:15.057
WAS WAS DONE? WHAT IS THAT

02:57:15.124 --> 02:57:16.826
STOPPING MECHANISM. SO THERE'S

02:57:16.892 --> 02:57:18.260
FORMS THAT ARE GENERATED BY THE

02:57:18.327 --> 02:57:19.695
KEDAH AND THE FAFSA. THEY'RE

02:57:19.762 --> 02:57:21.464
CALLED ICERS. AND IT'S LIKE

02:57:21.530 --> 02:57:23.566
IDENTIFYING STUDENT INFORMATION

02:57:23.632 --> 02:57:25.735
RECORD. AND THAT IS WHAT COMES

02:57:25.801 --> 02:57:27.903
TO EVERY GRANT AID AGENCY IN THE

02:57:27.970 --> 02:57:30.573
UNITED STATES. KEDAH JUST FOR

02:57:30.639 --> 02:57:32.675
CALIFORNIA, FAFSA FOR EVERYBODY.

02:57:32.742 --> 02:57:35.544
SO WHEN THOSE ARE ALL THEN SENT

02:57:35.611 --> 02:57:36.612
TO CALIFORNIA, THEY ARE

02:57:36.679 --> 02:57:38.714
RECONCILED AND WE DO THE MATCH

02:57:38.781 --> 02:57:40.549
ON OUR END. SO IF SOME STUDENT

02:57:40.616 --> 02:57:41.784
HAS ACTUALLY FILLED OUT A KEDAH

02:57:41.851 --> 02:57:43.586
AND FAFSA, WE MATCH THEM AND

02:57:43.652 --> 02:57:45.621
THEN THEY ONLY GET THE ONE ON

02:57:45.688 --> 02:57:46.922
RAMP INTO ONE BUCKET OF WHO'S

02:57:46.989 --> 02:57:48.557
THE WE? WE MATCH THEM, THE

02:57:48.624 --> 02:57:49.625
CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID

02:57:49.692 --> 02:57:51.260
COMMISSION I CAN HIS NAME IS

02:57:51.327 --> 02:57:52.962
TAY. NO NO NO I JUST I'M JUST

02:57:53.029 --> 02:57:54.663
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THAT

02:57:54.730 --> 02:57:56.799
WHAT DEPARTMENT THAT HAPPENS IN

02:57:56.866 --> 02:57:58.567
PROGRAM. PROGRAM AND SYSTEMS

02:57:58.634 --> 02:58:00.803
DEVELOPMENT AT STUDENT. AND IS

02:58:00.870 --> 02:58:03.239
THERE AN AUDIT PROCESS I'M

02:58:03.305 --> 02:58:06.242
CONCERNED WITH, WITH THE VERY

02:58:06.308 --> 02:58:07.943
SMALL PERCENTAGE OF SOMEONE WHO

02:58:08.010 --> 02:58:09.645
MIGHT WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

02:58:09.712 --> 02:58:10.646
THE SYSTEM WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO

02:58:10.713 --> 02:58:12.415
DO SOMETHING GOOD, THAT THERE IS

02:58:12.481 --> 02:58:14.150
THERE AN AUDIT OR SOMETHING THAT

02:58:14.216 --> 02:58:15.785
SAYS, OH, WOW, WE'RE GETTING A

02:58:15.851 --> 02:58:18.054
LOT OF THESE ISSUES, OR WE'RE

02:58:18.120 --> 02:58:20.456
NOT EVEN FINDING THIS. WHAT IS

02:58:20.523 --> 02:58:22.591
THAT PROCESS IN PLAY THERE? THAT

02:58:22.658 --> 02:58:25.728
IS SO YES, THERE IS NOT A

02:58:25.795 --> 02:58:27.530
PROCESS. SO YES, THERE IS NOT A

02:58:27.596 --> 02:58:28.464
PROCESS. YES, THERE IS A

02:58:28.531 --> 02:58:29.932
PROCESS. OH, THERE IS A PROCESS.

02:58:29.999 --> 02:58:32.201
SO WHEN YOU DO FILL OUT BOTH

02:58:32.268 --> 02:58:33.469
FORMS AND THEY BOTH COME TO THE

02:58:33.536 --> 02:58:35.204
STUDENT AID COMMISSION, THEY ARE

02:58:35.271 --> 02:58:36.338
MATCHED IN THEORY. ALSO YOU'RE

02:58:36.405 --> 02:58:37.807
PICKING YOUR SCHOOLS. AND SO

02:58:37.873 --> 02:58:39.642
THEN WE ARE GOING TO THEN SAY

02:58:39.708 --> 02:58:41.477
OKAY, JEFF GONZALEZ HAS NOW

02:58:41.544 --> 02:58:42.812
FILLED OUT A KEDAH AND A FAFSA,

02:58:42.878 --> 02:58:44.880
AND JEFF HAS FILLED OUT THE SAME

02:58:44.947 --> 02:58:45.481
COLLEGES ON BOTH. IT'S LIKE,

02:58:45.548 --> 02:58:47.383
WOW, THAT'S REALLY WEIRD. JEFF.

02:58:47.450 --> 02:58:48.651
JEFF THAT LIVES AT, YOU KNOW,

02:58:48.717 --> 02:58:49.885
1290, YOU KNOW, ONE, TWO, THREE

02:58:49.952 --> 02:58:51.454
BLAST OFF STREET HAS APPLIED FOR

02:58:51.520 --> 02:58:52.955
TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. BUT HE AND

02:58:53.022 --> 02:58:55.357
HE WANTS TO GO TO CAL STATE LA.

02:58:55.424 --> 02:58:56.559
WE'RE ONLY GOING TO GIVE HIM ONE

02:58:56.625 --> 02:58:58.194
BUCKET OF MONEY BECAUSE YOU

02:58:58.260 --> 02:58:59.829
CAN'T HAVE TWO BUCKETS OF MONEY.

02:58:59.895 --> 02:59:01.630
AND THAT IS RECONCILED ON OUR

02:59:01.697 --> 02:59:02.965
END BEFORE IT EVEN GOES TO THE

02:59:03.032 --> 02:59:04.300
INSTITUTION TO BE PACKAGED FOR

02:59:04.366 --> 02:59:05.568
YOUR STUDENT, FOR YOUR FINANCIAL

02:59:05.634 --> 02:59:07.336
AID PACKAGE. THAT HAPPENS AT THE

02:59:07.403 --> 02:59:08.003
STUDENT AID COMMISSION BEFORE IT

02:59:08.070 --> 02:59:09.805
GOES OUT TO ANY INSTITUTION.

02:59:09.872 --> 02:59:11.006
DOES IT HAPPEN MANUALLY AT AN

02:59:11.073 --> 02:59:13.175
INDIVIDUAL, OR IS THAT A THERE'S

02:59:13.242 --> 02:59:15.311
SOFTWARE THAT SAYS STOP, AND

02:59:15.377 --> 02:59:16.712
THERE'S NOT THAT LARGE OF A

02:59:16.779 --> 02:59:18.547
NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT THIS IS

02:59:18.614 --> 02:59:20.382
OCCURRING WITH. SO IT IS IT IS

02:59:20.449 --> 02:59:22.451
DONE MANUALLY. OKAY. YEAH. THAT

02:59:22.518 --> 02:59:24.620
WAS I THINK THAT WAS MY GREATEST

02:59:24.687 --> 02:59:26.422
CONCERN WITH THIS PIECE IS THE,

02:59:26.489 --> 02:59:29.992
THE OVERSIGHT IS NOW IT'S OPEN

02:59:30.059 --> 02:59:31.160
TO EVERYBODY. RIGHT. WE KNEW

02:59:31.227 --> 02:59:32.661
FROM AN UNDOCUMENTED PERSPECTIVE

02:59:32.728 --> 02:59:34.230
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE

02:59:34.296 --> 02:59:35.664
FAFSA. SO THERE WAS THAT LINE

02:59:35.731 --> 02:59:37.666
RIGHT THERE. BUT NOW YOU'RE

02:59:37.733 --> 02:59:38.968
SAYING ON THE KEDAH SIDE

02:59:39.034 --> 02:59:39.568
EVERYONE CAN OPEN IT UP. THEN

02:59:39.635 --> 02:59:41.570
THERE'S THE OPPORTUNITY FOR

02:59:41.637 --> 02:59:43.806
OBVIOUSLY BAD ACTORS TO DO THAT.

02:59:43.873 --> 02:59:45.174
BUT IF YOU'RE SAYING THAT THERE

02:59:45.241 --> 02:59:47.042
IS A ALREADY A SYSTEM IN PLACE

02:59:47.109 --> 02:59:48.844
IN THAT ALLEVIATES MY CONCERN.

02:59:48.911 --> 02:59:50.880
THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

02:59:50.946 --> 02:59:52.248
ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR

02:59:52.314 --> 02:59:54.517
COMMENTS? CNN SENATOR WOULD LIKE

02:59:54.583 --> 02:59:57.052

02:59:57.119 --> 02:59:58.220
APPRECIATE, ASSEMBLYMEMBER

02:59:58.287 --> 02:59:59.788
GONZALEZ. THE TECHNICAL

02:59:59.855 --> 03:00:01.657
QUESTIONS REALLY VALUE THAT. I

03:00:01.724 --> 03:00:04.560
SPENT MY CAREER IN EDUCATION. SO

03:00:04.627 --> 03:00:06.395
AND FINANCIAL AID IS

03:00:06.462 --> 03:00:08.564
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT

03:00:08.631 --> 03:00:09.832
ESPECIALLY THAT THAT OVERSIGHT

03:00:09.899 --> 03:00:11.000
COMPONENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY.

03:00:11.066 --> 03:00:12.201
WE'RE HAVING A LOT OF

03:00:12.268 --> 03:00:13.502
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THOSE SORTS OF

03:00:13.569 --> 03:00:15.304
THINGS RIGHT NOW IN THE

03:00:15.371 --> 03:00:16.639
EDUCATION SPACE FOR A NUMBER OF

03:00:16.705 --> 03:00:18.707
REASONS. THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT

03:00:18.774 --> 03:00:20.809
AID COMMISSION IS THE LEAD

03:00:20.876 --> 03:00:22.178
SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. SO WE'RE

03:00:22.244 --> 03:00:23.612
WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THEM

03:00:23.679 --> 03:00:26.282
ON IT. AND SOME OF THE TECHNICAL

03:00:26.348 --> 03:00:27.449
PIECES THAT WE NEED TO WORK OUT

03:00:27.516 --> 03:00:29.985
HERE. CERTAINLY, YOU KNOW, WE'RE

03:00:30.052 --> 03:00:31.620
WE'RE GETTING THIS PREPARED FOR

03:00:31.687 --> 03:00:34.323
A JUST IN CASE SCENARIO, BUT

03:00:34.390 --> 03:00:35.591
ALSO THINK THAT IT'S GOING TO BE

03:00:35.658 --> 03:00:37.626
A VERY IMPORTANT TOOL IF WE RUN

03:00:37.693 --> 03:00:41.230
INTO ANOTHER SITUATION WHERE THE

03:00:41.297 --> 03:00:42.498
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DECIDES TO

03:00:42.565 --> 03:00:44.433
MAKE UPDATES TO THE FAFSA AND

03:00:44.500 --> 03:00:45.968
THE ROLLOUT DOESN'T WORK OUT

03:00:46.035 --> 03:00:46.869
THAT WELL. AND THAT'S WHAT

03:00:46.936 --> 03:00:49.471
HAPPENED IN 2020. I WAS SITTING

03:00:49.538 --> 03:00:51.140
DOWN WITH, YOU KNOW, DOZENS OF

03:00:51.207 --> 03:00:52.508
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TRYING TO

03:00:52.575 --> 03:00:54.510
FIGURE OUT WHY THE FAFSA

03:00:54.577 --> 03:00:56.078
APPLICATION WASN'T WORKING,

03:00:56.145 --> 03:00:57.479
MAKING CALLS UP HERE TO THE

03:00:57.546 --> 03:00:58.847

03:01:04.720 --> 03:01:05.788
ISSUES FOR STUDENTS ALL ACROSS

03:01:05.854 --> 03:01:08.257
THE STATE AND VERY QUICKLY

03:01:08.324 --> 03:01:09.725
LEARNED FROM TALKING WITH

03:01:09.792 --> 03:01:10.292
ANYBODY, WHETHER IT WAS IN

03:01:10.359 --> 03:01:12.161
PUBLIC SCHOOLS OR CHARTER

03:01:12.228 --> 03:01:14.396
SCHOOLS, THAT PARENTS FAMILIES

03:01:14.463 --> 03:01:17.233
WERE HAVING A MAJOR ISSUE TRYING

03:01:17.299 --> 03:01:19.735
TO ACCESS STUDENT AID. SO, YOU

03:01:19.802 --> 03:01:21.537

03:01:21.604 --> 03:01:23.405
IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

03:01:23.472 --> 03:01:25.474
