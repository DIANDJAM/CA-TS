VIOLENT PREDATORS. PROGRAM

00:41:36.961 --> 00:41:38.596
DIFFICULTY FINDING SUITABLE

00:41:38.662 --> 00:41:41.098
HOUSING. THIS AUDIT GOES WITHOUT

00:41:44.635 --> 00:41:46.537

00:41:46.604 --> 00:41:48.038
CONCERNS IN OUR VARIOUS

00:41:48.105 --> 00:41:49.373

WHO REQUESTED THIS AUDIT. AND HE

00:42:01.018 --> 00:42:02.820

00:42:02.887 --> 00:42:05.022
THIS TOPIC. AND ALSO

00:42:05.089 --> 00:42:07.491
ASSEMBLYMEMBER CARRILLO, WHO HAS

00:42:07.558 --> 00:42:08.859
REALLY ENCOURAGED THIS HEARING

00:42:08.926 --> 00:42:11.528
TODAY AND HAS BEEN VERY DILIGENT

00:42:11.595 --> 00:42:13.230
ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THIS

00:42:13.297 --> 00:42:15.666
AUDIT CAME TO LIGHT AND

00:42:15.733 --> 00:42:17.668

SENATOR CARRILLO. THANK YOU TO

SENATOR JONES FOR EVERYTHING

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:24.141
THAT YOU HAVE DONE. I KNOW,

00:42:24.208 --> 00:42:25.943
SENATOR CARRILLO, THIS ISSUE IS

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:28.345
VERY IMPORTANT IN YOUR DISTRICT.

00:42:28.412 --> 00:42:29.914
AND WHY DON'T WE JUST VERY

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:31.515
BRIEFLY PAUSE. I'LL LET MY VICE

00:42:31.582 --> 00:42:33.484
CHAIR MAKE ANY OPENING REMARKS

00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:35.819
AND THEN I WILL I WILL THEN

00:42:35.886 --> 00:42:37.187
RELAY IT TO SENATOR JONES AND

00:42:37.254 --> 00:42:41.191
SUMMER CARRILLO. THANK YOU. I

00:42:41.258 --> 00:42:44.428
THINK YOU HAVE TO. THERE. THAT

00:42:44.495 --> 00:42:48.065
SHOULD BE IT. THANK YOU FOR THE

00:42:48.132 --> 00:42:49.566
OPPORTUNITY. AND I APPRECIATE

00:42:49.633 --> 00:42:51.869
THE FACT THAT YOU DID SOME

00:42:51.936 --> 00:42:54.905
SUMMARY THAT I WOULD HAVE

00:42:54.972 --> 00:42:57.007
OTHERWISE DONE. AND I THINK THE

00:42:57.074 --> 00:42:58.842
AUDIT IS REALLY GOOD, AND I

00:42:58.909 --> 00:43:00.377
THINK THE DEPARTMENT HAS STARTED

00:43:00.444 --> 00:43:02.947
TO BE REALLY RESPONSIVE. THE ONE

00:43:03.013 --> 00:43:04.348
POINT I WANTED TO MAKE IS FOR

00:43:04.415 --> 00:43:06.350
THOSE OF US THAT HAVE DISTRICTS

00:43:06.417 --> 00:43:09.653
THAT HAVE VERY RURAL PARTS, THE

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:12.089
STATE PRACTICES MANY TIMES

00:43:12.156 --> 00:43:13.924
BECAUSE OF PROHIBITIONS IN

00:43:13.991 --> 00:43:17.695
CERTAIN WAYS, PUT THE PLACEMENT

00:43:17.761 --> 00:43:20.230
OF SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATORS IN

00:43:20.297 --> 00:43:22.633
SOME OF THE MOST RURAL AREAS,

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:24.868
AND IT HAS BEEN SOME OF THE

00:43:24.935 --> 00:43:26.236
BIGGEST DISPUTES IN MY HOME

00:43:26.303 --> 00:43:28.072
DISTRICT, BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BE

00:43:28.138 --> 00:43:29.740
WITHIN A CERTAIN NUMBER OF FEET

00:43:29.807 --> 00:43:32.042
OF SCHOOLS OR OTHER THINGS, AND

00:43:32.109 --> 00:43:34.578
YET THEY'RE IN A THERE'S ONE

00:43:34.645 --> 00:43:35.980
PARTICULAR HIGH PROFILE ONE

00:43:36.046 --> 00:43:38.215
THAT'S JUST A FEW MILES FROM MY

00:43:38.282 --> 00:43:40.351
HOME, WHERE THERE'S JUST A BLOCK

00:43:40.417 --> 00:43:43.921
OF A VERY FEW PEOPLE. IT'S IN A

00:43:43.988 --> 00:43:47.391
COMPLETELY RURAL, ALMOST REMOTE

00:43:47.458 --> 00:43:49.893
AREA. AND YET THAT WAS ONE OF

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:52.396
THE FEW PLACES THAT FIT IN OUR

00:43:52.463 --> 00:43:55.399
PLACEMENT. AND SO IT'S MY

00:43:55.466 --> 00:43:58.302
MISFORTUNE THAT IT'S THE VICE

00:43:58.369 --> 00:44:00.070
PRESIDENT OF A STARTUP, MY

00:44:00.137 --> 00:44:01.538
PERSONAL PHYSICIAN. ALL THOSE

00:44:01.605 --> 00:44:03.340
PEOPLE ARE THE ONES THAT HAPPEN

00:44:03.407 --> 00:44:05.175
TO LIVE ON THAT BLOCK. AND SO I

00:44:05.242 --> 00:44:06.477
HAVE HEARD OVER AND OVER AND

00:44:06.543 --> 00:44:08.445
OVER AGAIN ABOUT THE RISKS FROM

00:44:08.512 --> 00:44:10.047
THAT PLACEMENT. AND SO I THINK

00:44:10.114 --> 00:44:12.683
IT READING THE AUDIT, IT WAS

00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:14.184
VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S VERY

00:44:14.251 --> 00:44:15.986
EASY TO MAKE THOSE RULES. AND

00:44:16.053 --> 00:44:18.088
THEN YOU SEE WHAT THE

00:44:18.155 --> 00:44:20.224
CONSEQUENCES ARE OF HOW THEY'RE

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:21.392
IMPLEMENTED. AND I THINK THAT'S

00:44:21.458 --> 00:44:22.726
WHAT TODAY'S HEARING IS ABOUT.

00:44:22.793 --> 00:44:24.495
SO I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY

00:44:24.561 --> 00:44:26.697
THAT GOT US TO THIS POINT. THANK

00:44:26.764 --> 00:44:28.098
YOU, MR. VICE CHAIR, SENATOR

00:44:28.165 --> 00:44:30.267
JONES. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN. I

00:44:30.334 --> 00:44:33.937
APPRECIATE IT. AS MOST PEOPLE

00:44:34.004 --> 00:44:35.739
KNOW, WHEN I FIRST GOT ELECTED

00:44:35.806 --> 00:44:37.107
TO THE SENATE IN 2018, THIS WAS

00:44:37.174 --> 00:44:39.643
ONE OF THE VERY FIRST

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:40.310
CONSTITUENT CALLS I RECEIVED WAS

00:44:40.377 --> 00:44:41.345
ABOUT A SEXUALLY VIOLENT

00:44:41.412 --> 00:44:43.280
PREDATOR BEING PLACED IN MY

00:44:43.347 --> 00:44:45.449
DISTRICT, AND I WAS SOMEWHAT

00:44:45.516 --> 00:44:47.151
FAMILIAR WITH THE SYSTEM FROM

00:44:47.217 --> 00:44:48.519
SERVING IN THE ASSEMBLY BEFORE

00:44:48.585 --> 00:44:51.488
THAT, BUT NOT AS AGGRESSIVELY

00:44:51.555 --> 00:44:52.756
FAMILIAR WITH IT AS MY

00:44:52.823 --> 00:44:53.991
CONSTITUENTS AT THAT POINT IN

00:44:54.058 --> 00:44:56.260
TIME MADE IT CLEAR. AND THEN

00:44:56.326 --> 00:44:58.429
AFTER THAT, SEVERAL OTHER

00:44:58.495 --> 00:45:00.531
SITUATIONS IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY

00:45:00.597 --> 00:45:03.901
THAT CAUSED VERY CAUSED A LOT OF

00:45:03.967 --> 00:45:05.602
CONCERNS ABOUT THIS PROGRAM. I

00:45:05.669 --> 00:45:07.337
WANT TO THANK AND RECOGNIZE

00:45:07.404 --> 00:45:08.839
ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVID ALVAREZ,

00:45:08.906 --> 00:45:11.408
WHO WAS THE CHAIR OF THE AUDIT

00:45:11.475 --> 00:45:12.576
COMMITTEE AT THAT POINT IN TIME

00:45:12.643 --> 00:45:14.445
WHEN THE AUDIT, WHEN I BROUGHT

00:45:14.511 --> 00:45:16.780
THE AUDIT REQUEST, HELPED GET

00:45:16.847 --> 00:45:19.917
THAT APPROVED. AND I'M PRETTY

00:45:19.983 --> 00:45:22.252
SURE IT WAS UNANIMOUS AT THE

00:45:22.319 --> 00:45:24.955
TIME THAT WE DID THAT. THANKS,

00:45:25.022 --> 00:45:26.623
ASSEMBLY MEMBER, FOR ASKING FOR

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:28.625
THIS OVERSIGHT. YOU KNOW,

00:45:28.692 --> 00:45:30.494
OFTENTIMES WE DO THESE OVERSIGHT

00:45:30.561 --> 00:45:31.795
OR ASK FOR THESE AUDITS. AND

00:45:31.862 --> 00:45:33.363
THEN THE AUDIT REPORT COMES AND

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:34.465
THEN WE NEVER DO ANYTHING ABOUT

00:45:34.531 --> 00:45:36.934
IT. SO I'M THANKFUL THAT WE'RE

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.302
ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING TODAY.

00:45:38.368 --> 00:45:39.870
TO FOLLOW UP ON THE AUDIT

00:45:39.937 --> 00:45:42.339
REQUEST, THE AUDIT REVEALED SOME

00:45:42.406 --> 00:45:44.208
VERY SYSTEMATIC PROBLEMS THAT

00:45:44.274 --> 00:45:45.976
NEED TO BE FIXED, AND I'M HOPING

00:45:46.043 --> 00:45:47.244
THAT WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE ABLE

00:45:47.311 --> 00:45:49.246
TO WORK TOGETHER TO THAT END.

00:45:49.313 --> 00:45:50.380
UNFORTUNATELY, IT APPEARS FROM

00:45:50.447 --> 00:45:52.049
SOME OF THE RESPONSES TO THE

00:45:52.116 --> 00:45:53.484
AUDIT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:54.284
STATE HOSPITALS THAT RATHER THAN

00:45:54.351 --> 00:45:56.820
REFORM THE BROKEN CONREP PROGRAM

00:45:56.887 --> 00:45:58.455
TO KEEP CALIFORNIA SAFE, THERE

00:45:58.522 --> 00:45:59.990
CONTINUES TO BE A TENDENCY TO

00:46:00.057 --> 00:46:02.159
SHIRK SOME RESPONSIBILITY AND

00:46:02.226 --> 00:46:05.095
HIDE FROM ACCOUNT THE CONREP THE

00:46:05.162 --> 00:46:07.598
CONREP SYSTEM IS BROKEN AND WE

00:46:07.664 --> 00:46:09.766
NEED SERIOUS REFORMS. WE NEED

00:46:09.833 --> 00:46:12.002
DHS TO TAKE A MORE ACTIVE ROLE

00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:13.003
IN THE PLACEMENT AND PROCESS

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:15.205
FROM THE BEGINNING. WE NEED TO

00:46:15.272 --> 00:46:16.573
EXPLORE NEW APPROACHES TO

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:17.641
PLACEMENT LIKE TRANSITIONAL

00:46:17.708 --> 00:46:19.543
HOUSING, INTERNALLY CONDUCTED

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:21.111
SITE SEARCHES, ALTERNATIVE

00:46:21.178 --> 00:46:22.312
VENDORS, AND MULTIPLE THIRD

00:46:22.379 --> 00:46:24.448
PARTY PARTNERS FOR DIFFERENT

00:46:24.515 --> 00:46:26.683
SERVICES, AND MORE. WE NEED TO

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:28.152
EXPLORE AND EXECUTE NEW WAYS TO

00:46:28.218 --> 00:46:29.620
CONDUCT THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE

00:46:29.686 --> 00:46:31.255
THIS PROGRAM IS BROKEN AND IT

00:46:31.321 --> 00:46:33.490
PUTS OUR COMMUNITIES AT RISK

00:46:33.557 --> 00:46:34.992
WITH EACH PASSING DAY THAT WE

00:46:35.058 --> 00:46:36.793
DON'T FIX IT. I HOPE THAT IT

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:38.495
MAKES IT CLEAR WHERE I'M COMING

00:46:38.562 --> 00:46:40.297
FROM ON THIS ISSUE, AND THAT OUR

00:46:40.364 --> 00:46:41.765
PRESENTERS TODAY WILL BE WILLING

00:46:41.832 --> 00:46:43.100
AND READY TO ANSWER SOME TOUGH

00:46:43.167 --> 00:46:44.268
QUESTIONS AND PROVIDE SOME

00:46:44.334 --> 00:46:46.069
DETAILED INFORMATION SO THAT WE

00:46:46.136 --> 00:46:47.571
MAY COME AWAY FROM HERE TODAY

00:46:47.638 --> 00:46:48.839
WITH THE BEGINNINGS OF SOME

00:46:48.906 --> 00:46:50.007
SOLUTIONS. THANK YOU, MR.

00:46:50.073 --> 00:46:51.909

BY THANKING YOU FOR CONVENING US

00:46:58.248 --> 00:47:01.818
HERE TODAY. I BELIEVE THAT I

00:47:01.885 --> 00:47:03.687
HEARD SENATOR JONES AND SENATOR

00:47:03.754 --> 00:47:05.856
LEHRER SAYING THAT THEY HAVE ONE

00:47:05.923 --> 00:47:07.658
OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS IN THEIR

00:47:07.724 --> 00:47:09.593
DISTRICT. I HAVE THREE IN THE

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:11.995
HIGH DESERT, AND THAT'S OF HIGH

00:47:12.062 --> 00:47:14.898
CONCERN FOR US. THE ORIGINAL

00:47:14.965 --> 00:47:17.067
INTENT FOR ME BEING BEING HERE

00:47:17.134 --> 00:47:19.136
TODAY WITH THE REST OF YOU IS SO

00:47:19.203 --> 00:47:20.837
THAT NOT ONLY I CAN UNDERSTAND

00:47:20.904 --> 00:47:22.372
BETTER WHAT THE PROCESS IS FOR

00:47:22.439 --> 00:47:24.508
THE PLACEMENT, BUT ALSO FOR OUR

00:47:24.575 --> 00:47:25.742
CONSTITUENTS TO KNOW WHAT THE

00:47:25.809 --> 00:47:27.611
PROCESS IS. THERE SEEMS TO BE,

00:47:27.678 --> 00:47:29.646
IN MY VIEW, AND SOME OF THE

00:47:29.713 --> 00:47:31.949
PEOPLE I'VE COME TALK TO ME IN

00:47:32.015 --> 00:47:32.849
THE DISTRICT, AMBIGUITY ON HOW

00:47:32.916 --> 00:47:35.752
THE PROCESS WORKS, HOW A JUDGE

00:47:35.819 --> 00:47:38.555
HAS THE DISCRETION TO PLACE THIS

00:47:38.622 --> 00:47:41.458
INDIVIDUALS BASED ON THEIR OWN

00:47:41.525 --> 00:47:42.659
JUDGMENTS. MY UNDERSTANDING, AND

00:47:42.726 --> 00:47:44.428
AGAIN, THAT'S WHY I'M HERE, SO

00:47:44.494 --> 00:47:45.929
THAT I CAN GET EDUCATED. AND

00:47:45.996 --> 00:47:47.231
ALSO FOR MY CONSTITUENTS THAT

00:47:47.297 --> 00:47:49.199
HAVE REACHED OUT TO ME WITH THE

00:47:49.266 --> 00:47:52.035
BIG CONCERN OF WHY IS IT THAT WE

00:47:52.102 --> 00:47:53.370
IN THE HIGH DESERT, WHICH IS

00:47:53.437 --> 00:47:55.339
ABOUT 60 MILES FROM LA, WE KEEP

00:47:55.405 --> 00:47:56.807
GETTING THESE INDIVIDUALS IN OUR

00:47:56.873 --> 00:47:58.709
COMMUNITIES? LIKE I SAID, IT'S

00:47:58.775 --> 00:48:01.211
THREE OF THEM. ONE OF THEM WAS

00:48:01.278 --> 00:48:03.247
THERE TEN YEARS AGO, I BELIEVE,

00:48:03.313 --> 00:48:05.315
AND HE VIOLATED HIS CONDITIONAL

00:48:05.382 --> 00:48:08.151
RELEASE. AND HE'S BACK AGAIN. SO

00:48:08.218 --> 00:48:09.620
AGAIN, FOR ME, I UNDERSTAND WHAT

00:48:09.686 --> 00:48:12.389
THE PROCESS IS AND ALSO QUESTION

00:48:12.456 --> 00:48:14.992
THE WAY THAT THIS IS HANDLED

00:48:15.058 --> 00:48:16.493
FROM AN ORGANIZATION THAT IS OUT

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:18.595
OF FLORIDA THAT IS NOT EVEN IN

00:48:18.662 --> 00:48:20.430
THE STATE. I UNDERSTAND THAT

00:48:20.497 --> 00:48:22.566
THERE WAS A PROCESS ON HOW THIS

00:48:22.633 --> 00:48:24.668
HAPPENED. I GOT SELECTED, BUT

00:48:24.735 --> 00:48:27.271
IT'S JUST UNCLEAR TO ME HOW WE

00:48:27.337 --> 00:48:29.072
IN CALIFORNIA SELECTED A COMPANY

00:48:29.139 --> 00:48:31.308
OUT OF FLORIDA TO MANAGE THIS

00:48:31.375 --> 00:48:34.578
PROGRAM. I ASK FOR MAYBE AN RFP

00:48:34.645 --> 00:48:35.779
AND RFQ TO START THIS PROCESS

00:48:35.846 --> 00:48:38.048
AGAIN TO SEE HOW WE CAN GET

00:48:38.115 --> 00:48:39.950
AGENCIES OR THIS ORGANIZATION

00:48:40.017 --> 00:48:41.918
HAS BEEN INTERESTED FROM

00:48:41.985 --> 00:48:43.754
MANAGING THIS PROGRAM THAT ARE

00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:45.656
RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA, NOT ON

00:48:45.722 --> 00:48:47.591
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE NATION.

00:48:47.658 --> 00:48:48.959
AGAIN, THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR, FOR

00:48:49.026 --> 00:48:50.260
ALLOWING US TO HAVE THIS

00:48:50.327 --> 00:48:51.161
CONVERSATION. I LOOK FORWARD FOR

00:48:51.228 --> 00:48:52.929
THIS CONVERSATION. AGAIN. I SEE

00:48:52.996 --> 00:48:54.965
THIS AS A LEARNING EXPERIENCE

00:48:55.032 --> 00:48:56.800
FOR ME AS WELL, BUT ALSO FOR

00:48:56.867 --> 00:48:58.201
THOSE CONSTITUENTS IN THE 39TH

00:48:58.268 --> 00:48:59.236
ASSEMBLY DISTRICT, THE HIGH

00:48:59.303 --> 00:49:01.071
DESERT, WHERE WE HAVE THREE OF

00:49:01.138 --> 00:49:02.139
THOSE INDIVIDUALS BEING PLACED

00:49:02.205 --> 00:49:03.807
THERE. THANK YOU AGAIN. THANK

00:49:03.874 --> 00:49:06.576
YOU, SENATOR, AND FOR EVERYTHING

00:49:06.643 --> 00:49:09.012
YOU HAVE DONE AGAIN TO BRING US

00:49:09.079 --> 00:49:10.447
HERE. WE ARE GOING TO GET THIS

00:49:10.514 --> 00:49:12.115
PROCESS STARTED AGAIN. I THINK

00:49:12.182 --> 00:49:13.550
ALL OF US WANT TO LEARN A LITTLE

00:49:13.617 --> 00:49:15.519
BIT MORE ABOUT THE CONDITIONAL

00:49:15.585 --> 00:49:16.820
RELEASE PROGRAM WE HAVE BROUGHT

THE I DIDN'T PLEASE TAKE A SEAT

AS WE'RE KICKING THIS OFF. AND

00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:28.532
WE'VE ALSO BROUGHT LIBERTY

00:49:28.598 --> 00:49:30.300
HEALTHCARE, WHO ACTUALLY RUNS

00:49:30.367 --> 00:49:32.636
THE PROGRAM, AS WELL AS THE

00:49:32.703 --> 00:49:33.770
DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS,

00:49:33.837 --> 00:49:35.172
WHO OVERSEES THE PROGRAM. AND

00:49:35.238 --> 00:49:36.506
AGAIN, I THINK ALL OF US HAVE

00:49:36.573 --> 00:49:38.275
MANY QUESTIONS, AND THE AUDIT

00:49:38.342 --> 00:49:39.943
HAS BROUGHT FORWARD SOME

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:42.579
INFORMATION THAT WE'D LIKE SOME

00:49:42.646 --> 00:49:43.180
CLARIFICATION AND BRING OTHER

00:49:43.246 --> 00:49:44.915
THINGS TO LIGHT BEFORE WE GET

00:49:44.981 --> 00:49:46.650
INTO TESTIMONY AND QUESTIONS.

00:49:46.717 --> 00:49:49.052
JUST A FEW HOUSEKEEPING RULES TO

00:49:49.119 --> 00:49:50.287
ENSURE WE HEAR FROM EVERYONE. WE

00:49:50.354 --> 00:49:51.455
WOULD ASK THAT ANY PANELISTS

00:49:51.521 --> 00:49:54.024

00:49:54.091 --> 00:49:56.159
ALLOCATED TIME FOR MR. AUDITOR.

00:49:56.226 --> 00:49:57.994
IF YOU COULD KEEP IT UNDER TEN

00:49:58.061 --> 00:49:59.429
MINUTES, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

00:49:59.496 --> 00:50:00.297
AND FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE

00:50:00.364 --> 00:50:02.733
HOSPITALS AND LIBERTY HEALTHCARE

00:50:02.799 --> 00:50:03.800
ALSO TEN MINUTES. I DO KNOW THAT

00:50:03.867 --> 00:50:05.836
SOME MEMBERS UP HERE HAVE A TIME

00:50:05.902 --> 00:50:06.970
CRUNCH AND WOULD LIKE TO ASK

00:50:07.037 --> 00:50:08.004

00:50:08.071 --> 00:50:09.639

NEED TO LEAVE. WE WILL THEN HAVE

00:50:19.916 --> 00:50:21.651
MEMBERS ASK QUESTIONS, AND WE

00:50:21.718 --> 00:50:23.520
WILL RESERVE TIME FOR PUBLIC

00:50:23.587 --> 00:50:25.422

DISTURBANCES OR ANYTHING THAT

00:50:29.493 --> 00:50:31.428

00:50:31.495 --> 00:50:32.562
SO ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE

00:50:32.629 --> 00:50:34.331

PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY. IN

00:51:15.338 --> 00:51:16.807
OCTOBER 2024, MY OFFICE ISSUED

00:51:16.873 --> 00:51:18.508
AN AUDIT REPORT EXAMINING THE

00:51:18.575 --> 00:51:20.143
DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS

00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:21.478
ADMINISTRATION OF THE CALIFORNIA

00:51:21.545 --> 00:51:22.512
FORENSIC CONDITIONAL RELEASE

00:51:22.579 --> 00:51:23.947
PROGRAM, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS

00:51:24.014 --> 00:51:25.782
CONREP, AS IT APPLIES TO

00:51:25.849 --> 00:51:27.150
INDIVIDUALS CLASSIFIED BY THE

00:51:27.217 --> 00:51:28.985
COURTS AS SEXUALLY VIOLENT

00:51:29.052 --> 00:51:31.121
PREDATORS BY WAY OF A VERY BRIEF

00:51:31.188 --> 00:51:33.023
BACKGROUND, BEGINNING IN 1996,

00:51:33.089 --> 00:51:34.458
STATE LAW ALLOWED THE COURTS TO

00:51:34.524 --> 00:51:36.526
CIVILLY COMMIT INDIVIDUALS

00:51:36.593 --> 00:51:38.295
FOLLOWING THEIR PRISON SENTENCES

00:51:38.361 --> 00:51:39.696
TO AN INDETERMINATE LENGTH OF

00:51:39.763 --> 00:51:42.165
TIME AT STATE HOSPITALS FOR

00:51:42.232 --> 00:51:42.999
TREATMENT IF THEY WERE CONVICTED

00:51:43.066 --> 00:51:44.701
OF A SEXUALLY VIOLENT OFFENSE

00:51:44.768 --> 00:51:46.670
AND HAVE A DIAGNOSED MENTAL

00:51:46.736 --> 00:51:48.839
DISORDER, INCREASING THEIR RISK

00:51:48.905 --> 00:51:51.308
TO REOFFEND. AND IN 2003, THE

00:51:51.374 --> 00:51:53.143
STATE STARTED THE CONREP PROGRAM

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:54.644
FOR SVP'S, WHERE COURTS CAN

00:51:54.711 --> 00:51:56.313
ORDER THAT CERTAIN SVP'S WHO ARE

00:51:56.379 --> 00:51:58.215
RECEIVING TREATMENT AT STATE

00:51:58.281 --> 00:51:59.416
HOSPITALS TO INSTEAD BE HOUSED

00:51:59.483 --> 00:52:01.685
IN THE COMMUNITY UNDER DSHS

00:52:01.751 --> 00:52:03.920
SUPERVISION. DSH CONTRACTS WITH

00:52:03.987 --> 00:52:05.388
LIBERTY HEALTH CARE FOR A

00:52:05.455 --> 00:52:06.756
SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE

00:52:06.823 --> 00:52:07.958
CONREP PROGRAM, INCLUDING

00:52:08.024 --> 00:52:09.392
TREATMENT, SECURITY AND HOUSING

00:52:09.459 --> 00:52:11.294
LOCATION ASSISTANCE. AND IF

00:52:11.361 --> 00:52:13.964
THESE CONREP PARTICIPATING SVP'S

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:15.165
DEMONSTRATE POOR BEHAVIOR WHILE

00:52:15.232 --> 00:52:16.566
IN THE COMMUNITY OR DO NOT

00:52:16.633 --> 00:52:18.802
FOLLOW PROGRAM RULES, A COURT OR

00:52:18.869 --> 00:52:20.804
A JUDGE MAY REVOKE THEIR

00:52:20.871 --> 00:52:22.739
PARTICIPATION AND RETURN THEM TO

00:52:22.806 --> 00:52:24.140
A DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITAL

00:52:24.207 --> 00:52:26.643
FACILITY AND COURTS MAY ALSO

00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:27.711
UNCONDITIONALLY RELEASE SVP'S

00:52:27.777 --> 00:52:29.880
FROM STATE HOSPITALS WITHOUT THE

00:52:29.946 --> 00:52:31.615
SVP'S. PARTICIPATION IN THE

00:52:31.681 --> 00:52:34.951
CONREP PROGRAM AT ALL. SINCE THE

00:52:35.018 --> 00:52:35.952
INCEPTION OF THE PROGRAM, THERE

00:52:36.019 --> 00:52:38.522
HAVE BEEN 56 SVP'S WHO HAVE BEEN

00:52:38.588 --> 00:52:39.956
PLACED IN THE COMMUNITY THROUGH

00:52:40.023 --> 00:52:42.125
CONREP. THAT'S 2003 THROUGH

00:52:42.192 --> 00:52:44.961
ROUGHLY APRIL 2024. AND SEPARATE

00:52:45.028 --> 00:52:47.430
FROM THAT, THERE HAVE BEEN 125

00:52:47.497 --> 00:52:49.633
SVP'S WHERE THE COURTS HAVE

00:52:49.699 --> 00:52:51.801
UNCONDITIONALLY RELEASED SVP'S

00:52:51.868 --> 00:52:53.503
WITHOUT PLACEMENT THROUGH CONREP

00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:55.405
BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY. AND

00:52:55.472 --> 00:52:57.974
FINALLY, I'D MENTION IN 2023,

00:52:58.041 --> 00:53:00.143
STATE LAW ADDED A REQUIREMENT

00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:02.512
THAT FOR THE SVP CONRAD PROGRAM,

00:53:02.579 --> 00:53:04.014
IT REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:05.849
STATE HOSPITALS TO CONSULT WITH

00:53:05.916 --> 00:53:07.751
AND RECEIVE ASSISTANCE FROM

00:53:07.817 --> 00:53:10.554
LOCAL OFFICIALS WHEN LOCATING

00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:12.822
AND SECURING COMMUNITY HOUSING

00:53:12.889 --> 00:53:15.959
FOR SVP'S. SO THE AUDIT REQUEST

00:53:16.026 --> 00:53:17.894
WAS REQUESTED BY SENATOR JONES.

00:53:17.961 --> 00:53:20.330
AND IF I WAS TO PARAPHRASE THE

00:53:20.397 --> 00:53:21.765
DRIVING FORCE BEHIND IT, IT WAS

00:53:21.831 --> 00:53:23.333
GENERALLY THREE PRIMARY AREAS,

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:24.968
THE FIRST ONE BEING PUBLIC

00:53:25.035 --> 00:53:26.836
SAFETY. SENATOR JONES WAS

00:53:26.903 --> 00:53:27.637
INTERESTED IN GETTING

00:53:27.704 --> 00:53:29.406
INFORMATION ON THE NUMBER OF NEW

00:53:29.472 --> 00:53:30.674
CONVICTIONS BY CATEGORY OF

00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:32.309
OFFENSE COMMITTED BY SVP, PLACED

00:53:32.375 --> 00:53:34.311
IN THE COMMUNITY VIA CONREP, AND

00:53:34.377 --> 00:53:36.646
THE NUMBER OF SVP WHO VIOLATED

00:53:36.713 --> 00:53:38.248
THE TERMS OF CONDITIONS OF THEIR

00:53:38.315 --> 00:53:39.649
HOUSING PLACEMENTS IN THE CONREP

00:53:39.716 --> 00:53:41.251
PROGRAM AND HAD BEEN RETURNED TO

00:53:41.318 --> 00:53:43.720
STATE HOSPITALS. SECONDLY, THE

00:53:43.787 --> 00:53:44.621
SENATOR WAS INTERESTED IN

00:53:44.688 --> 00:53:46.556
KNOWING WHETHER COUNTIES WERE

00:53:46.623 --> 00:53:47.958
EFFECTIVELY PARTICIPATING IN THE

00:53:48.024 --> 00:53:50.760
COMMUNITY PLACEMENT PROCESS. AND

00:53:50.827 --> 00:53:52.596
THIRD, THERE WAS INTEREST IN

00:53:52.662 --> 00:53:54.130
UNDERSTANDING MORE ABOUT STATE

00:53:54.197 --> 00:53:55.632
HOSPITALS OVERSIGHT OF LIBERTY

00:53:55.699 --> 00:53:57.233
HEALTH CARE. SO TO GET TO THE

00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:58.935
AUDIT RESULTS WITH RESPECT TO

00:53:59.002 --> 00:54:01.338
ISSUE ONE PUBLIC SAFETY, WE

00:54:01.404 --> 00:54:03.139
FOUND THAT SVP'S, PARTICIPATING

00:54:03.206 --> 00:54:05.208
IN THE CONREP PROGRAM WERE

00:54:05.275 --> 00:54:07.377
CONVICTED OF NEW OFFENSES LESS

00:54:07.444 --> 00:54:09.846
FREQUENTLY THAN SVP'S WHO WERE

00:54:09.913 --> 00:54:11.481
UNCONDITIONALLY RELEASED BY THE

00:54:11.548 --> 00:54:12.449
COURTS AND DID NOT PARTICIPATE

00:54:12.515 --> 00:54:16.152
IN CONREP. TWO OF THE 56 SVP'S

00:54:16.219 --> 00:54:17.520
THAT WERE PLACED IN THE

00:54:17.587 --> 00:54:19.322
COMMUNITY UNDER CONREP WERE

00:54:19.389 --> 00:54:21.524
CONVICTED OF A NEW OFFENSE. ONE

00:54:21.591 --> 00:54:23.660
WAS FOR THE FAILURE TO REPORT AS

00:54:23.727 --> 00:54:25.428
A SEX OFFENDER, AND THE OTHER

00:54:25.495 --> 00:54:26.796
ONE WAS FOR THE POSSESSION OF

00:54:26.863 --> 00:54:29.399
CHILD PORNOGRAPHY. NONE OF THE

00:54:29.466 --> 00:54:31.935
NONE OF THE REMAINING 54

00:54:32.002 --> 00:54:33.637
PARTICIPATING SVP'S WERE

00:54:33.703 --> 00:54:34.971
CONVICTED OF NEW OFFENSES DURING

00:54:35.038 --> 00:54:37.340
THEIR TIME IN CONREP, AND OF

00:54:37.407 --> 00:54:39.776
THOSE, 21 OF THOSE SVP'S WERE

00:54:39.843 --> 00:54:41.244
SUBSEQUENTLY UNCONDITIONALLY

00:54:41.311 --> 00:54:43.046
RELEASED BY THE COURTS INTO THE

00:54:43.113 --> 00:54:44.581
COMMUNITY, AND NONE OF THEM WERE

00:54:44.648 --> 00:54:45.982
CONVICTED OF A NEW OFFENSE

00:54:46.049 --> 00:54:48.485
WITHIN TEN YEARS. IN CONTRAST,

00:54:48.551 --> 00:54:50.153
THE RATE OF NEW OFFENSES WAS

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:51.988
HIGHER FOR SVP'S, WHO WERE

00:54:52.055 --> 00:54:53.123
UNCONDITIONALLY RELEASED BY THE

00:54:53.189 --> 00:54:54.591
COURTS WITHOUT PARTICIPATING IN

00:54:54.658 --> 00:54:58.728
THE CONREP PROGRAM. 24 OF THE

00:54:58.795 --> 00:55:01.097
125 UNCONDITIONALLY RELEASED SVP

00:55:01.164 --> 00:55:03.233
WERE CONVICTED OF A NEW CRIME,

00:55:03.299 --> 00:55:05.735
AND THESE 24 SVP'S WERE

00:55:05.802 --> 00:55:07.837
CONVICTED OF 55 NEW OFFENSES. 42

00:55:07.904 --> 00:55:09.706
OF THEM WERE FELONIES AND 13 OF

00:55:09.773 --> 00:55:11.941
THEM WERE MISDEMEANORS. 22 OF

00:55:12.008 --> 00:55:14.411
THE 42 FELONIES WERE UNRELATED

00:55:14.477 --> 00:55:15.912
TO SEXUAL RELATED OFFENSES. 13

00:55:15.979 --> 00:55:17.681
OF THE 42 WERE FOR FAILURE TO

00:55:17.747 --> 00:55:19.683
REPORT AS A SEX OFFENDER, AND

00:55:19.749 --> 00:55:21.451
SEVEN OF THE 42 WERE FOR SEXUAL

00:55:21.518 --> 00:55:23.987
OR SEXUALLY VIOLENT ACTS. THE

00:55:24.054 --> 00:55:26.356
LOWER CONVICTION RATES FOR SVP'S

00:55:26.423 --> 00:55:27.390
PARTICIPATING IN THE CONREP

00:55:27.457 --> 00:55:28.758
PROGRAM MAY BE PARTLY EXPLAINED

00:55:28.825 --> 00:55:31.027
BY COURTS RETURNING SDPS TO

00:55:31.094 --> 00:55:32.262
STATE HOSPITALS BEFORE THEY

00:55:32.328 --> 00:55:34.531
COMMIT NEW CRIMES IF THEY START

00:55:34.597 --> 00:55:35.598
TO DEMONSTRATE NEGATIVE

00:55:35.665 --> 00:55:37.400
BEHAVIOR, SUCH AS BY FAILING TO

00:55:37.467 --> 00:55:39.302
APPEAR FOR THERAPY, FAILING TO

00:55:39.369 --> 00:55:40.970
APPEAR FOR THERAPY SESSIONS,

00:55:41.037 --> 00:55:42.505
FAILING TO TAKE MEDICATION,

00:55:42.572 --> 00:55:43.940
FAILING TO SUBMIT TO DRUG

00:55:44.007 --> 00:55:45.608
SCREENINGS AND THE COURTS HAVE

00:55:45.675 --> 00:55:47.477
REVOKED AND RETURNED TO STATE

00:55:47.544 --> 00:55:50.680
HOSPITALS. 18 OF THE 56 SB WHO

00:55:50.747 --> 00:55:52.048
HAVE BEEN PLACED IN THE

00:55:52.115 --> 00:55:53.249
COMMUNITY SINCE THE PROGRAM

00:55:53.316 --> 00:55:55.652
STARTED, OR ROUGHLY 32%. WE

00:55:55.719 --> 00:55:57.654
REVIEWED COURT RECORDS TO

00:55:57.721 --> 00:55:58.655
DETERMINE THE SPECIFIC

00:55:58.722 --> 00:56:00.457
VIOLATIONS THAT PROMPTED THE

00:56:00.523 --> 00:56:02.258
REVOCATIONS, BUT COURT RECORDS

00:56:02.325 --> 00:56:04.327
COMMONLY CITED GENERIC TERMS

00:56:04.394 --> 00:56:06.663
LIKE NONCOMPLIANCE WITH PROGRAM

00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:08.231
RULES AND TERMS AND CONDITIONS,

00:56:08.298 --> 00:56:09.999
AND DID NOT CITE MORE SPECIFIC

00:56:10.066 --> 00:56:11.835
INFORMATION OF THE SPECIFIC

00:56:11.901 --> 00:56:13.203
VIOLATIONS THAT CAUSED THE

00:56:13.269 --> 00:56:15.605
REVOCATION. AND SOME OF THE

00:56:15.672 --> 00:56:17.340
SVP'S WHO WERE RETURNED TO STATE

00:56:17.407 --> 00:56:18.608
HOSPITALS HAVE BEEN AUTHORIZED

00:56:18.675 --> 00:56:20.176
BY THE COURT TO AGAIN

00:56:20.243 --> 00:56:22.746
PARTICIPATE IN CONREP, GENERALLY

00:56:22.812 --> 00:56:24.447
3 TO 17 YEARS AFTER

00:56:24.514 --> 00:56:26.082
PARTICIPATION WAS REVOKED. SOME

00:56:26.149 --> 00:56:27.450
OF THOSE SVP'S ARE IN THE

00:56:27.517 --> 00:56:29.085
COMMUNITY TODAY, SOME ARE

00:56:29.152 --> 00:56:30.887
AWAITING PLACEMENT, AND OTHERS

00:56:30.954 --> 00:56:31.421
HAVE BEEN UNCONDITIONALLY

00:56:31.488 --> 00:56:34.057
RELEASED BY THE COURTS. IN TERMS

00:56:34.124 --> 00:56:35.725
OF ISSUE TWO, HOW EFFECTIVE IS

00:56:35.792 --> 00:56:37.761
THE COMMUNITY PLACEMENT PROCESS

00:56:37.827 --> 00:56:39.095
AND TO WHAT EXTENT ARE LOCAL

00:56:39.162 --> 00:56:40.797
GOVERNMENTAL OFFICIALS

00:56:40.864 --> 00:56:42.432
PARTICIPATING? I WOULD MENTION

00:56:42.499 --> 00:56:44.634
AT THE OUTSET THAT AT THE START

00:56:44.701 --> 00:56:46.169
OF MY AUDIT OR DURING MY AUDIT,

00:56:46.236 --> 00:56:47.871
MY OFFICE INTERPRETED STATE LAW

00:56:47.937 --> 00:56:49.839
AS GENERALLY REQUIRING THAT

00:56:49.906 --> 00:56:51.608
SVP'S BE PLACED IN THE COMMUNITY

00:56:51.674 --> 00:56:53.343
WITHIN 30 DAYS, FOLLOWING A

00:56:53.409 --> 00:56:55.512
COURT'S DETERMINATION THAT AN

00:56:55.578 --> 00:56:57.013
SVP SHOULD PARTICIPATE IN THE

00:56:57.080 --> 00:56:59.115
CONREP PROGRAM. HOWEVER,

00:56:59.182 --> 00:57:00.450
FOLLOWING MY AUDIT'S PUBLIC

00:57:00.517 --> 00:57:02.352
RELEASE, A SUBSEQUENT COURT

00:57:02.418 --> 00:57:03.686
DECISION RULED THAT THE 30 DAY

00:57:03.753 --> 00:57:05.588
PLACEMENT REQUIREMENT ACTUALLY

00:57:05.655 --> 00:57:07.957
BEGINS WHEN THE COURT HAS

00:57:08.024 --> 00:57:08.858
APPROVED A SPECIFIC HOUSING

00:57:08.925 --> 00:57:10.693
PLACEMENT FOR SVP'S. BUT

00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:12.262
REGARDLESS OF THIS RULING, OUR

00:57:12.328 --> 00:57:13.463
PRIMARY CONCLUSION IN THE AUDIT

00:57:13.530 --> 00:57:15.365
REMAINS THE SAME, WHICH IS THAT

00:57:15.431 --> 00:57:17.133
IT TAKES A LONG TIME FOR THE

00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:18.301
DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS

00:57:18.368 --> 00:57:20.236
AND LIBERTY TO FIND SUITABLE

00:57:20.303 --> 00:57:21.471
HOUSING FOR SVP'S IN THE

00:57:21.538 --> 00:57:23.072
COMMUNITY. AND SECONDLY, WE

00:57:23.139 --> 00:57:24.340
FOUND THAT LOCAL OFFICIALS WE

00:57:24.407 --> 00:57:26.376
SPOKE TO WERE AT TIMES UNCLEAR

00:57:26.442 --> 00:57:27.911
OF THEIR ROLE ON THIS HOUSING

00:57:27.977 --> 00:57:29.712
COMMITTEE, AND SOME DIDN'T WANT

00:57:29.779 --> 00:57:31.214
TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS

00:57:31.281 --> 00:57:33.349
PUBLICLY. SO WITH RESPECT TO HOW

00:57:33.416 --> 00:57:35.518
LONG DOES IT TAKE TO FIND

00:57:35.585 --> 00:57:36.452
HOUSING FOR SVP'S, WE FOUND THAT

00:57:36.519 --> 00:57:38.788
THE STATE TOOK, ON AVERAGE, 17

00:57:38.855 --> 00:57:40.857
MONTHS TO PLACE CURRENT SVP

00:57:40.924 --> 00:57:42.659
PARTICIPANTS IN THE COMMUNITY AS

00:57:42.725 --> 00:57:44.127
MEASURED BY THE TIME ELAPSING

00:57:44.194 --> 00:57:45.795
BETWEEN WHEN A COURT APPROVES

00:57:45.862 --> 00:57:48.498
THE SVP'S PARTICIPATION IN THE

00:57:48.565 --> 00:57:50.300
PROGRAM AND WHEN THE COURT

00:57:50.366 --> 00:57:51.467
ULTIMATELY APPROVES THE HOUSING

00:57:51.534 --> 00:57:54.103
LOCATION FOR TWO OF THOSE, SVP'S

00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:55.905
TOOK MORE THAN THREE YEARS TO

00:57:55.972 --> 00:57:58.608
FIND HOUSING, AND AS OF APRIL

00:57:58.675 --> 00:58:00.877
2024, THERE ARE 20 ADDITIONAL

00:58:00.944 --> 00:58:02.679
SVP'S WHO ARE AWAITING HOUSING

00:58:02.745 --> 00:58:04.280
PLACEMENTS, AND THE AVERAGE WAIT

00:58:04.347 --> 00:58:06.082
TIME FOR THIS GROUP WAS 20

00:58:06.149 --> 00:58:08.184
MONTHS. ONE OF THESE SVP'S HAS

00:58:08.251 --> 00:58:10.086
BEEN WAITING FOR FOUR AND A HALF

00:58:10.153 --> 00:58:11.754
YEARS, AND IN OUR VIEW, THAT'S A

00:58:11.821 --> 00:58:13.356
LONG TIME TO KEEP AN SVP IN THE

00:58:13.423 --> 00:58:14.657
MORE RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT OF

00:58:14.724 --> 00:58:16.392
STATE HOSPITALS. WHEN A COURT

00:58:16.459 --> 00:58:17.627
HAS ALREADY AUTHORIZED THEM TO

00:58:17.694 --> 00:58:18.895
BE PLACED IN THE COMMUNITY,

00:58:18.962 --> 00:58:20.763
SUBJECT ONLY TO FINDING SUITABLE

00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:22.532
HOUSING. OTHER INFORMATION WE

00:58:22.599 --> 00:58:23.900
LEARNED IN RESPONSE TO SENATOR

00:58:23.967 --> 00:58:25.268
JONES QUESTIONS IS OUR AUDIT

00:58:25.335 --> 00:58:27.270
NOTED THAT LIBERTY HEALTHCARE

00:58:27.337 --> 00:58:30.506
CHARGES UP TO $2,800 PER MONTH

00:58:30.573 --> 00:58:32.709
FOR EACH SVP, WHO'S AWAITING PRE

00:58:32.775 --> 00:58:34.644
PLACEMENT SERVICES, HOUSING

00:58:34.711 --> 00:58:37.013
SEARCH COSTS PRE PLACEMENT IN

00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:40.917
FISCAL YEAR 2223 WAS $485,000

00:58:40.984 --> 00:58:43.019
AND COST TO HOLD HOUSING UNDER

00:58:43.086 --> 00:58:45.521
CONSIDERATION WAS $415,000 FOR

00:58:45.588 --> 00:58:48.591
FISCAL YEAR 2223. AND WHEN WE

00:58:48.658 --> 00:58:50.293
LOOKED AT WHERE SVP'S ARE

00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:51.194
ACTUALLY PLACED IN THE

00:58:51.261 --> 00:58:53.062
COMMUNITY, WE FOUND THAT

00:58:53.129 --> 00:58:54.364
GENERALLY THEY ARE NOT LOCATED

00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:56.733
NEAR EACH OTHER. HOWEVER, WE DID

00:58:56.799 --> 00:58:57.967
IDENTIFY A SMALL NUMBER OF

00:58:58.034 --> 00:58:59.802
PLACEMENTS THAT WERE WITHIN FIVE

00:58:59.869 --> 00:59:01.471
MILES OF ANOTHER PLACEMENT. BUT

00:59:01.537 --> 00:59:02.872
GIVEN THE LIMITED NUMBER OF

00:59:02.939 --> 00:59:04.941
SDP'S IN THE PROGRAM AND VARIOUS

00:59:05.008 --> 00:59:05.608
LEGAL RESTRICTIONS THAT

00:59:05.675 --> 00:59:06.709
PROHIBITED US FROM GOING INTO

00:59:06.776 --> 00:59:08.211
GREATER DETAIL IN THE AUDIT

00:59:08.278 --> 00:59:10.680
REPORT DISCUSSING THE DETAILS OF

00:59:10.747 --> 00:59:13.416
THOSE PLACEMENTS, WE ALSO TALKED

00:59:13.483 --> 00:59:15.652
TO DSH ABOUT BARRIERS TO TIMELY

00:59:15.718 --> 00:59:17.453
COMMUNITY PLACEMENT OF SVP AND

00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:19.422
ACCORDING TO DSH, ONE OF THE

00:59:19.489 --> 00:59:21.190
REASONS FOR ITS CHALLENGES IN

00:59:21.257 --> 00:59:22.725
FINDING HOUSING IS THE LIMITED

00:59:22.792 --> 00:59:24.060
NUMBER OF LANDLORDS WHO ARE

00:59:24.127 --> 00:59:25.728
WILLING TO RENT FOR THE PURPOSE

00:59:25.795 --> 00:59:27.563
OF HOUSING SVP, AND ANOTHER

00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:29.899
ISSUE THAT CAN CAUSE DELAYS ARE

00:59:29.966 --> 00:59:31.601
THE PRESENCE OF HOMESCHOOLS THAT

00:59:31.668 --> 00:59:33.903
MAY BE NEAR AN SVP, AND

00:59:33.970 --> 00:59:34.971
SOMETIMES THOSE HOMESCHOOLS

00:59:35.038 --> 00:59:36.639
AREN'T DISCOVERED UNTIL AFTER A

00:59:36.706 --> 00:59:38.274
JUDGE HAS ALREADY DECIDED TO

00:59:38.341 --> 00:59:39.575
MAKE A PLACEMENT DECISION. AND

00:59:39.642 --> 00:59:42.445
IN THE REPORT, WE GO THROUGH AN

00:59:42.512 --> 00:59:43.246
EXAMPLE WHERE A JUDGE HAD MADE A

00:59:43.313 --> 00:59:44.747
RULING TO PLACE SOMEBODY, ONLY

00:59:44.814 --> 00:59:46.749
TO REVERSE IT AND RESTART THE

00:59:46.816 --> 00:59:47.283
HOUSING PROCESS BECAUSE A

00:59:47.350 --> 00:59:50.119
HOMESCHOOL WAS LOCATED. WE ALSO

00:59:50.186 --> 00:59:51.688
FOUND THAT THE LOCAL HOUSING

00:59:51.754 --> 00:59:53.589
COMMITTEE PROCESS, ENACTED IN

00:59:53.656 --> 00:59:56.693
LAW FACES TWO HURDLES TO GREATER

00:59:56.759 --> 00:59:58.728
TO GREATER EFFECTIVENESS. THIS

00:59:58.795 --> 01:00:00.196
HOUSING COMMITTEE IS MADE UP OF

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:01.597
LOCAL OFFICIALS LIKE THE

01:00:01.664 --> 01:00:03.433
DISTRICT ATTORNEY, COUNTY

01:00:03.499 --> 01:00:04.801
COUNSEL, LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND

01:00:04.867 --> 01:00:06.202
THEIR ROLE IS TO ADVISE AND

01:00:06.269 --> 01:00:07.971
CONSULT DSH ON THE PLACEMENT OF

01:00:08.037 --> 01:00:10.239
SVP'S IN THE COMMUNITY. HOWEVER,

01:00:10.306 --> 01:00:11.874
STATE LAW DOES NOT DEFINE ANY

01:00:11.941 --> 01:00:13.643
SPECIFIC DELIVERABLES FOR THIS

01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:15.311
COMMITTEE FOR WHEN THEY CONVENE,

01:00:15.378 --> 01:00:17.847
SO IDENTIFYING WHAT SPECIFIC

01:00:17.914 --> 01:00:20.416
HELP THESE LOCATE THESE LOCAL

01:00:20.483 --> 01:00:21.784
COMMITTEES SHOULD BE PROVIDING

01:00:21.851 --> 01:00:23.186
TO DSH IS CHALLENGING. AND AT

01:00:23.252 --> 01:00:24.854
THE TIME OF OUR AUDIT, DSH

01:00:24.921 --> 01:00:26.189
HADN'T PROVIDED CLEAR GUIDANCE

01:00:26.255 --> 01:00:27.590
TO LOCAL OFFICIALS ON HOW THEY

01:00:27.657 --> 01:00:29.959
COULD BEST HELP IN THE HOUSING

01:00:30.026 --> 01:00:32.462
SELECTION PROCESS. WE ALSO

01:00:32.528 --> 01:00:34.263
INTERVIEWED COUNTY COMMITTEE

01:00:34.330 --> 01:00:36.099
MEMBERS FROM SACRAMENTO, SAN

01:00:36.165 --> 01:00:38.001
DIEGO AND STANISLAUS COUNTIES,

01:00:38.067 --> 01:00:39.469
AND THEY EXPLAINED TO US THAT

01:00:39.535 --> 01:00:40.870
THEY DID NOT ALWAYS CLEARLY

01:00:40.937 --> 01:00:42.238
UNDERSTAND HOW TO PARTICIPATE ON

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:44.607
THE HOUSING COMMITTEE AND WHAT

01:00:44.674 --> 01:00:46.242
DSH AND LIBERTY HEALTH WERE

01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:48.011
ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR IN TERMS OF

01:00:48.077 --> 01:00:51.014
GUIDANCE FROM JANUARY 2023, WHEN

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.715
THE LAW CHANGED TO REQUIRE THESE

01:00:52.782 --> 01:00:54.684
HOUSING COMMITTEES TO APRIL

01:00:54.751 --> 01:00:58.154
2024, DSH CONVENED 15 COMMITTEE

01:00:58.221 --> 01:00:59.489
MEETINGS IN TEN DIFFERENT

01:00:59.555 --> 01:01:00.790
COUNTIES. WE REVIEWED THE

01:01:00.857 --> 01:01:01.991
MEETING MINUTES, BUT WE DIDN'T

01:01:02.058 --> 01:01:03.493
SEE A LOT OF DETAIL ON THE

01:01:03.559 --> 01:01:04.660
NATURE OF THESE DISCUSSIONS OR

01:01:04.727 --> 01:01:05.995
WHAT WAS SPECIFICALLY DISCUSSED

01:01:06.062 --> 01:01:08.231
IN THESE HEARINGS WITH RESPECT

01:01:08.297 --> 01:01:09.532
TO SPECIFIC PLACEMENT OPTIONS OR

01:01:09.599 --> 01:01:12.802
WHAT WAS CONSIDERED. WE ALSO SAW

01:01:12.869 --> 01:01:13.970
EVIDENCE THAT LOCAL

01:01:14.037 --> 01:01:14.871
REPRESENTATIVES DID NOT ALWAYS

01:01:14.937 --> 01:01:16.539
WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN LOCAL

01:01:16.606 --> 01:01:19.142
MEETINGS CALLED FOR BY DSH. FOR

01:01:19.208 --> 01:01:20.076
EXAMPLE, THE STANISLAUS

01:01:20.143 --> 01:01:21.077
SHERIFF'S OFFICE DIDN'T

01:01:21.144 --> 01:01:21.878
PARTICIPATE IN ONE OF THE

01:01:21.944 --> 01:01:23.679
MEETINGS WE REVIEWED, DELEGATING

01:01:23.746 --> 01:01:25.048
TO THE COUNTY'S COUNSEL. AND IN

01:01:25.114 --> 01:01:27.316
SAN DIEGO, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM

01:01:27.383 --> 01:01:28.484
THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE TOLD US

01:01:28.551 --> 01:01:31.187
THAT IF AN SVP RE-OFFENDED, THE

01:01:31.254 --> 01:01:32.455
SHERIFF WOULD NOT WANT TO BE ON

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:34.357
THE RECORD OF HAVING HAVING

01:01:34.424 --> 01:01:36.192
ENDORSED THE PLACEMENT. AND AS A

01:01:36.259 --> 01:01:37.593
RESULT, THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE

01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:38.828
OFFICIAL DIDN'T WANT TO SUPPORT

01:01:38.895 --> 01:01:40.997
ANY SVP PLACEMENT IN THE

01:01:41.064 --> 01:01:42.331
COMMUNITY. AND WE NOTED THAT

01:01:42.398 --> 01:01:43.699
BOTH SAN DIEGO DISTRICT ATTORNEY

01:01:43.766 --> 01:01:45.635
AND THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE HAVE

01:01:45.701 --> 01:01:47.336
NOTICES ON THEIR WEBSITES

01:01:47.403 --> 01:01:48.504
EXPLAINING THAT THEY ARE NOT

01:01:48.571 --> 01:01:50.673
INVOLVED OR RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:51.941
SELECTING SVP PLACEMENT

01:01:52.008 --> 01:01:54.844
LOCATIONS. SO WHAT THIS GOT US

01:01:54.911 --> 01:01:56.345
TO DURING THE AUDIT IS A

01:01:56.412 --> 01:01:58.281
QUESTION OF TRANSITIONAL

01:01:58.347 --> 01:01:59.482
HOUSING. DURING OUR AUDIT, WE

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:01.150
NOTED THAT CALIFORNIA DOESN'T

01:02:01.217 --> 01:02:02.752
HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE HOUSING

01:02:02.819 --> 01:02:05.254
OPTION FOR WHEN COURTS, DSH AND

01:02:05.321 --> 01:02:06.923
LOCAL HOUSING COMMUNITIES CAN'T

01:02:06.989 --> 01:02:08.958
LOCATE OR AGREE ON A SUITABLE

01:02:09.025 --> 01:02:10.793
HOUSING LOCATION, AND INSTEAD,

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:12.128
SVP MUST REMAIN IN THE MORE

01:02:12.195 --> 01:02:13.729
RESTRICTIVE STATE HOSPITAL

01:02:13.796 --> 01:02:14.864
SETTING. OUR AUDIT NOTED THAT

01:02:14.931 --> 01:02:16.499
OTHER STATES DON'T OPERATE THIS

01:02:16.566 --> 01:02:18.835
WAY. WASHINGTON, MINNESOTA,

01:02:18.901 --> 01:02:20.403
KANSAS AND TEXAS, FOR EXAMPLE,

01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:21.971
ALL USE STATE OWNED OR

01:02:22.038 --> 01:02:24.107
CONTRACTED TRANSITIONAL HOUSING

01:02:24.173 --> 01:02:25.875
TO SERVE AS AN INTERMEDIATE STEP

01:02:25.942 --> 01:02:27.110
BETWEEN RECEIVING TREATMENT IN

01:02:27.176 --> 01:02:29.345
STATE HOSPITALS AND RECEIVING

01:02:29.412 --> 01:02:30.913
TREATMENT IN A COMMUNITY

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:33.883
SETTING. THE FINAL ISSUE THAT

01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:35.351
I'LL BRIEFLY TALK ABOUT BY

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:38.020
ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS, WE

01:02:38.087 --> 01:02:39.856
LOOKED AT DSHS OVERSIGHT OF

01:02:39.922 --> 01:02:42.959
LIBERTY HEALTHCARE. OUR AUDIT

01:02:43.025 --> 01:02:44.260
LOOKED AT WHETHER OR NOT THE SVP

01:02:44.327 --> 01:02:46.095
IN THE COMMUNITY HAD CURRENT

01:02:46.162 --> 01:02:47.263
TREATMENT PLANS. WE FOUND THAT

01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:49.465
MOST OF THEM DID. THERE WERE 19

01:02:49.532 --> 01:02:51.134
IN THE COMMUNITY, IN THE

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.869
COMMUNITY AT THE TIME OF OUR

01:02:52.935 --> 01:02:54.737
AUDIT IN APRIL 2024, 17 OF THE

01:02:54.804 --> 01:02:56.506
19 HAD UP TO DATE TREATMENT

01:02:56.572 --> 01:02:57.540
PLANS. THE TWO OTHERS WERE

01:02:57.607 --> 01:02:59.242
UPDATED THE DAY AFTER WE

01:02:59.308 --> 01:03:00.042
REQUESTED THEM. AND THESE

01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:01.144
TREATMENT PLANS ARE REALLY

01:03:01.210 --> 01:03:02.612
IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY DEFINE

01:03:02.678 --> 01:03:04.147
TREATMENT GOALS AND OBJECTIVES,

01:03:04.213 --> 01:03:05.948
AND WE ALSO DID TESTING TO

01:03:06.015 --> 01:03:07.650
ENSURE THAT A SELECTION OF THESE

01:03:07.717 --> 01:03:09.218
SVP IN THE COMMUNITY WERE

01:03:09.285 --> 01:03:10.253
ACTUALLY RECEIVING CORE

01:03:10.319 --> 01:03:11.787
TREATMENT SERVICES CALLED FOR

01:03:11.854 --> 01:03:14.190
UNDER THEIR PLAN, SUCH AS

01:03:14.257 --> 01:03:16.125
THERAPY SESSIONS, UNSCHEDULED

01:03:16.192 --> 01:03:18.194
HOME VISITS, SUBSTANCE ABUSE

01:03:18.261 --> 01:03:19.562
SCREENINGS AND SEXUAL INTEREST

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:20.463
SCREENINGS. AND WE FOUND THAT

01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:21.964
THESE SERVICES WERE LARGELY

01:03:22.031 --> 01:03:25.001
PROVIDED. AN AREA WHERE WE SAW

01:03:25.067 --> 01:03:26.969
ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT WAS STATE

01:03:27.036 --> 01:03:27.803
HOSPITALS, WAS, IN TERMS OF

01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:30.173
HOLDING LIBERTY ACCOUNTABLE FOR

01:03:30.239 --> 01:03:32.575
CORRECTING DEFICIENCIES THAT DSH

01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:35.745
ITSELF HAD IDENTIFIED. WE NOTED

01:03:35.811 --> 01:03:37.847
THAT DSH HAD CONCERNS THAT

01:03:37.914 --> 01:03:38.714
CLINICIANS WHO ARE WORKING IN

01:03:38.781 --> 01:03:40.082
THE FIELD DIDN'T CONSISTENTLY

01:03:40.149 --> 01:03:42.151
HAVE ACCESS TO NECESSARY

01:03:42.218 --> 01:03:43.319
DOCUMENTS, SUCH AS PATIENT

01:03:43.386 --> 01:03:45.154
RECORDS AND COURT REPORTS WHEN

01:03:45.221 --> 01:03:46.989
MAKING TREATMENT DECISIONS, THAT

01:03:47.056 --> 01:03:49.458
THAT COULD IMPACT PUBLIC SAFETY.

01:03:49.525 --> 01:03:52.028
AND WE ALSO NOTED THAT,

01:03:52.094 --> 01:03:52.762
ACCORDING TO DSH, LIBERTY'S

01:03:52.828 --> 01:03:54.130
ELECTRONIC DOCUMENT REPOSITORY

01:03:54.197 --> 01:03:55.565
SYSTEM WAS NOT FUNCTIONING IN A

01:03:55.631 --> 01:03:57.333
MANNER THAT WOULD ALLOW SERVICE

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:59.001
PROVIDERS TO SEE ALL THE

01:03:59.068 --> 01:03:59.602
NECESSARY INFORMATION BEFORE

01:03:59.669 --> 01:04:01.737
MAKING TREATMENT DECISIONS.

01:04:01.804 --> 01:04:03.172
ANOTHER ISSUE THAT DSH RAISED IN

01:04:03.239 --> 01:04:04.740
ITS OWN REVIEWS OF LIBERTY WAS

01:04:04.807 --> 01:04:06.175
THE LACK OF STANDARD

01:04:06.242 --> 01:04:07.944
DOCUMENTATION PRACTICES, WHERE

01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:10.012
DSH WAS AT TIMES UNABLE TO

01:04:10.079 --> 01:04:11.948
DISCERN IF A PARTICULAR DOCUMENT

01:04:12.014 --> 01:04:13.883
THEY EXPECTED TO SEE IN AN SVP'S

01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:16.052
FILE WAS MISSING OR DID NOT

01:04:16.118 --> 01:04:18.120
EXIST. AND IT'S NOT CLEAR TO US

01:04:18.187 --> 01:04:20.089
DURING THE AUDIT WHEN THESE

01:04:20.156 --> 01:04:22.758
ISSUES OR OTHERS WILL GET FIXED.

01:04:22.825 --> 01:04:24.827
BECAUSE DSH DID NOT REQUIRE.

01:04:24.894 --> 01:04:27.063
TIMELY CONCERN. MR. PARK, JUST

01:04:27.129 --> 01:04:28.264
ONE MORE MINUTE IF YOU CAN. IF

01:04:28.331 --> 01:04:30.466
YOU CAN WRAP IT UP. THANK YOU.

01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:32.401
DSH DIDN'T HAVE A PROCESS TO

01:04:32.468 --> 01:04:33.669
ENSURE THAT LIBERTY RESPONDED

01:04:33.736 --> 01:04:35.605
PROMPTLY TO ITS CONCERNS, AND WE

01:04:35.671 --> 01:04:37.707
NOTED THAT DSH DIDN'T PRIORITIZE

01:04:37.773 --> 01:04:40.076
AUDIT FINDINGS TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:04:40.142 --> 01:04:41.944
LIBERTY WAS PROACTIVELY MAKING

01:04:42.011 --> 01:04:46.349
CORRECTIONS. WE MADE FIVE OR SO

01:04:46.415 --> 01:04:47.183
RECOMMENDATIONS TO LIBERTY

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:49.051
HEALTH IN TERMS OF PROVIDING

01:04:49.118 --> 01:04:51.320
CLEAR EXPECTATIONS TO THE

01:04:51.387 --> 01:04:53.623
COMMUNITY, AMONG OTHER AREAS,

01:04:53.689 --> 01:04:55.791
THEY IMPLEMENTED FOUR OF THE

01:04:55.858 --> 01:04:57.193
FIVE RECOMMENDATIONS. THE ONE

01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:58.961
RECOMMENDATION DSH HAS NOT

01:04:59.028 --> 01:05:00.229
IMPLEMENTED AND SAID THAT THEY

01:05:00.296 --> 01:05:02.164
WILL NOT IMPLEMENT, IS TO

01:05:02.231 --> 01:05:03.933
EXPLORE THE FEASIBILITY OF

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.034
ESTABLISHING TRANSITIONAL

01:05:05.101 --> 01:05:06.469
HOUSING FACILITIES AS THAT

01:05:06.535 --> 01:05:08.237
INTERIM STEP BETWEEN STATE

01:05:08.304 --> 01:05:09.305
HOSPITALS AND COMMUNITY

01:05:09.372 --> 01:05:11.607
PLACEMENT. AND I HAVE BEN WARD

01:05:11.674 --> 01:05:12.208
WITH ME, OUR AUDIT PRINCIPAL,

01:05:12.275 --> 01:05:14.343
AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

01:05:14.410 --> 01:05:15.278
QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK

01:05:15.344 --> 01:05:16.479
YOU, MR. PARKS. THANK YOU, MR.

01:05:16.545 --> 01:05:18.481
WARD, FOR BEING HERE. I KNOW

01:05:18.547 --> 01:05:19.382
MEMBERS WILL HAVE QUESTIONS, SO

01:05:19.448 --> 01:05:20.583
APPRECIATE THAT AND WE'LL BE

01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:22.385
ABLE TO EXPLORE SOME OF THE

01:05:22.451 --> 01:05:24.053
THINGS THAT MAYBE YOU DIDN'T GET

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.321
TO TOUCH UPON IN QUESTIONS. I

01:05:25.388 --> 01:05:26.522
KNOW SENATOR JONES, ASSEMBLY

01:05:26.589 --> 01:05:27.723
MEMBER CARRILLO, AND THEN TAMAYO

01:05:27.790 --> 01:05:29.125
HAVE QUESTIONS. SO LET'S JUST GO

01:05:29.191 --> 01:05:30.559
QUICKLY TO SENATOR JONES CARILLO

01:05:30.626 --> 01:05:31.327
THEN TAMAYO. THANK YOU. NOT A

01:05:31.394 --> 01:05:32.662
QUESTION. JUST A QUICK COMMENT.

01:05:32.728 --> 01:05:34.864
I'M THE AUDIT WAS VERY WELL

01:05:34.930 --> 01:05:37.366
DONE, PROVIDED A LOT OF GREAT

01:05:37.433 --> 01:05:39.302
INFORMATION, ACTUALLY ANSWERED,

01:05:39.368 --> 01:05:40.369
PROVIDED SOME INFORMATION WE

01:05:40.436 --> 01:05:41.404
DIDN'T EVEN ASK FOR. THAT WAS

01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:43.539
EVEN BETTER. THE ONE EXCEPTION I

01:05:43.606 --> 01:05:45.541
TAKE, WHICH I THINK IS A VERY

01:05:45.608 --> 01:05:46.409
IMPORTANT EXCEPTION BECAUSE IT'S

01:05:46.475 --> 01:05:48.844
IN THE TITLE THAT THE THAT THE

01:05:48.911 --> 01:05:49.679
PROGRAM IS ALLUDING THAT IT'S

01:05:49.745 --> 01:05:51.881
SUCCESSFUL WITH ONLY TWO

01:05:51.947 --> 01:05:53.316
OFFENSES, BUT WE NEED TO ADD UP

01:05:53.382 --> 01:05:56.252
THE TOTAL NUMBERS OF. YES, THERE

01:05:56.319 --> 01:05:58.487
WERE TWO PEOPLE THAT REOFFENDED

01:05:58.554 --> 01:05:59.422
AND WERE CONVICTED, BUT AS WAS

01:05:59.488 --> 01:06:01.257
STATED IN THE AUDITOR'S

01:06:01.324 --> 01:06:03.292
COMMENTS, 18 PEOPLE WERE

01:06:03.359 --> 01:06:04.694
RETURNED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.195
STATE HOSPITALS BECAUSE THEY

01:06:06.262 --> 01:06:09.465
FAILED THE CONREP PROGRAM. AND

01:06:09.532 --> 01:06:11.467
SO IF YOU ADD THOSE TWO NUMBERS

01:06:11.534 --> 01:06:13.369
TOGETHER, THAT'S ACTUALLY A 37%

01:06:13.436 --> 01:06:16.539
FAILURE RATE. AND SO THAT'S THE

01:06:16.605 --> 01:06:18.107
ONE EXCEPTION I HAVE WITH THE

01:06:18.174 --> 01:06:20.910
AUDIT IS IT IS NOT WORKING. IT

01:06:20.976 --> 01:06:24.046
IS A BROKEN SYSTEM AND DOES NEED

01:06:24.113 --> 01:06:24.714
TO BE FIXED. THANK YOU, SENATOR

01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:26.749
JONES. SENATOR CREAL, YOU DID

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:28.351
ANSWER ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT

01:06:28.417 --> 01:06:31.120
I HAD AND WAS THAT WAS ON THE

01:06:31.187 --> 01:06:31.787
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU STATED

01:06:31.854 --> 01:06:33.356
I WAS GOING TO ASK ABOUT THE

01:06:33.422 --> 01:06:34.190
INTERMEDIATE HOUSING THAT OTHER

01:06:34.256 --> 01:06:36.459
STATES HAVE IMPLEMENTED. THE

01:06:36.525 --> 01:06:37.493
ANSWER TO THAT IS THAT DHS DID

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.829
NOT WANT TO TAKE THAT AS A

01:06:39.895 --> 01:06:40.930
RECOMMENDATION. CORRECT. DSH DID

01:06:40.996 --> 01:06:42.264
NOT WANT TO TAKE THAT

01:06:42.331 --> 01:06:44.133
RECOMMENDATION. CAN YOU

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:45.901
ELABORATE AS TO HOW THAT, IN

01:06:45.968 --> 01:06:49.138
YOUR EXPERIENCE, BE A BETTER

01:06:49.205 --> 01:06:50.606
OPTION TO HAVE THIS SBP BEING

01:06:50.673 --> 01:06:53.008
PLACED? I THINK FROM OUR

01:06:53.075 --> 01:06:54.810
PERSPECTIVE ON THE AUDIT, WE'RE

01:06:54.877 --> 01:06:57.380
LOOKING AT WHERE A JUDGE HAS

01:06:57.446 --> 01:06:59.181
ORDERED THAT THEY BE PLACED IN

01:06:59.248 --> 01:07:00.649
THE COMMUNITY, AND THE DELAY IS

01:07:00.716 --> 01:07:02.017
FINDING WHERE THAT SUITABLE

01:07:02.084 --> 01:07:04.186
HOUSING IS TO BE. WE LOOKED AT

01:07:04.253 --> 01:07:05.354
OTHER STATES AND WE FOUND THAT

01:07:05.421 --> 01:07:07.123
THEY HAVE STATE OPERATED

01:07:07.189 --> 01:07:08.190
TRANSITIONAL HOUSING THAT ALLOWS

01:07:08.257 --> 01:07:10.259
YOU TO GET AN SVP AS A MIDWAY

01:07:10.326 --> 01:07:11.861
POINT INTO THAT HOUSING OUT OF

01:07:11.927 --> 01:07:13.529
THE LESS RESTRICTIVE STATE

01:07:13.596 --> 01:07:15.097
HOSPITAL ENVIRONMENT BEFORE

01:07:15.164 --> 01:07:16.332
THEY'RE PLACED IN THE COMMUNITY.

01:07:16.399 --> 01:07:18.167
SO IT ALLOWS THE COMMUNITY

01:07:18.234 --> 01:07:19.602
PLACEMENT PROCESS TO CONTINUE

01:07:19.668 --> 01:07:22.171
TO, TO GO FORWARD. BUT AT THE

01:07:22.238 --> 01:07:24.140
WHILE THAT'S GOING ON, THEY'RE

01:07:24.206 --> 01:07:26.175
NO LONGER IN THE STATE HOSPITAL.

01:07:26.242 --> 01:07:28.310
THEY'RE IN A SECURE BUT

01:07:28.377 --> 01:07:29.412
APPROPRIATELY SECURE

01:07:29.478 --> 01:07:31.914
TRANSITIONAL FACILITY. AND THE

01:07:31.981 --> 01:07:33.883
LAST QUESTION OR COMMENT IS ON

01:07:33.949 --> 01:07:35.351
THE WORDS USED, SUITABLE

01:07:35.418 --> 01:07:37.186
HOUSING. AND I GUESS THAT'S

01:07:37.253 --> 01:07:39.522
SOMETHING THAT MAY NOT BE A

01:07:39.588 --> 01:07:41.424
QUESTION FOR YOU, BUT TO THE

01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:43.025
OTHER PRESENTERS, AND WHEN WE

01:07:43.092 --> 01:07:44.527
TALK ABOUT SUITABLE HOUSING FOR

01:07:44.593 --> 01:07:47.797
THESE INDIVIDUALS, WHY IS IT

01:07:47.863 --> 01:07:49.698
SUITABLE HOUSING ANYWHERE IN THE

01:07:49.765 --> 01:07:51.767
STATE WHERE THESE AREAS THAT

01:07:51.834 --> 01:07:53.436
AGAIN, THE ONES THAT WE

01:07:53.502 --> 01:07:54.804
REPRESENT KEEP GETTING SELECTED

01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:57.873
AS SUITABLE HOUSING? DOES THAT

01:07:57.940 --> 01:07:59.842
MEAN THAT OUR RESIDENTS

01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:02.478
CONSTITUENTS ARE NOT EQUAL TO

01:08:02.545 --> 01:08:04.013
EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE STATE? AND

01:08:04.079 --> 01:08:05.881
MAYBE A RHETORICAL QUESTION AND

01:08:05.948 --> 01:08:07.516
AGAIN, I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO

01:08:07.583 --> 01:08:09.051
ANSWER, BUT YOU CAN COMMENT IF

01:08:09.118 --> 01:08:11.320
YOU LIKE. SURE. YOU KNOW, ONE OF

01:08:11.387 --> 01:08:13.289
THE THINGS THAT WE TRY TO BE

01:08:13.355 --> 01:08:15.858
VERY CLEAR ABOUT IN THE AUDIT

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:16.692
REPORT IS IT'S NOT THE COMMUNITY

01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:19.161
AND IT'S NOT LIBERTY THAT OR DSH

01:08:19.228 --> 01:08:20.863
THAT ARE ULTIMATELY MAKING THE

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:22.565
PLACEMENT DECISIONS. IT'S A

01:08:22.631 --> 01:08:23.732
JUDGE THAT'S MAKING THE

01:08:23.799 --> 01:08:26.735
PLACEMENT DECISIONS, AND IT'S A

01:08:26.802 --> 01:08:28.270
PROCESS THAT'S GOING ON IN COURT

01:08:28.337 --> 01:08:30.239
WHERE DSH IS HAVING ITS, SAY,

01:08:30.306 --> 01:08:32.374
THE LOCAL, AS REPRESENTED BY THE

01:08:32.441 --> 01:08:33.342
DISTRICT ATTORNEY OR COUNTY

01:08:33.409 --> 01:08:34.510
COUNSEL OR LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE

01:08:34.577 --> 01:08:36.545
HAVING THEIR SAY. AND ULTIMATELY

01:08:36.612 --> 01:08:39.215
A JUDGE DECIDES AS PART OF THIS

01:08:39.281 --> 01:08:40.816
AUDIT, AND IT WASN'T PART OF OUR

01:08:40.883 --> 01:08:42.551
AUDIT OBJECTIVES OR SCOPE IS WE

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:44.286
DID NOT AUDIT THE JUDICIAL

01:08:44.353 --> 01:08:46.388
DECISION MAKING BEHIND HOW

01:08:46.455 --> 01:08:48.123
JUDGES MAKE THEIR DECISIONS

01:08:48.190 --> 01:08:50.092
ABOUT WHERE THEY PLACE IN THE

01:08:50.159 --> 01:08:52.895
COMMUNITY. SO WHEN WE GO BACK TO

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:54.463
THOSE TWO WORDS, SUITABLE

01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:56.398
HOUSING, WHY ARE URBAN AREAS NOT

01:08:56.465 --> 01:08:57.700
SUITABLE FOR THEM? WHY IS IT

01:08:57.766 --> 01:08:59.802
THAT ALWAYS IT'S GOING TO BE

01:08:59.869 --> 01:09:00.436
RURAL AREAS WHICH IN WHICH WE

01:09:00.503 --> 01:09:02.605
HAVE OUR OWN CHALLENGES? AS

01:09:02.671 --> 01:09:04.073
SENATOR LARRY SAID, URBAN AREAS

01:09:04.139 --> 01:09:06.141
SEEM TO BE WHERE THEY GET TO BE.

01:09:06.208 --> 01:09:07.476
AGAIN, IT'S NOT ON YOU, IT'S ON

01:09:07.543 --> 01:09:08.911
THE JUDGES THAT THAT ONE

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:10.312
INDIVIDUAL THAT MAKES THAT

01:09:10.379 --> 01:09:11.547
DECISION. BUT WHEN THEY GET

01:09:11.614 --> 01:09:14.149
PLACED IN RURAL AREAS WHERE LAW

01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:16.218
ENFORCEMENT ACCESS IS EVEN NOT

01:09:16.285 --> 01:09:21.123
AS ACCURATE AS RAPID IN IN URBAN

01:09:21.190 --> 01:09:24.226
AREAS BECAUSE THEY HAVE BETTER

01:09:24.293 --> 01:09:27.129
TIME RESPONSE. WHEREAS IN MY

01:09:27.196 --> 01:09:28.864
CASE, WHERE THEY'RE PLACED IN

01:09:28.931 --> 01:09:30.766
LAKE LOS ANGELES, WHERE WE HAVE

01:09:30.833 --> 01:09:31.567
A SHERIFF'S OFFICE IN PALMDALE,

01:09:31.634 --> 01:09:32.801
WHICH IS A LONG DISTANCE FOR

01:09:32.868 --> 01:09:35.671
THEM TO RESPOND. ALSO WITH, YOU

01:09:35.738 --> 01:09:36.672
MENTIONED ON YOUR STUDY THAT

01:09:36.739 --> 01:09:38.707
YOUR REPORT THAT HOME SCHOOLING

01:09:38.774 --> 01:09:40.175
ALSO BEEN ANOTHER ANOTHER

01:09:40.242 --> 01:09:41.343
PROBLEM. WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE

01:09:41.410 --> 01:09:43.012
TO SEE THAT MORE HOME SCHOOLING

01:09:43.078 --> 01:09:44.380
BEING MORE PERMANENT. I BELIEVE,

01:09:44.446 --> 01:09:46.849
AGAIN, I'M JUST TRYING TO LET

01:09:46.916 --> 01:09:49.852
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL WHEN WE TALK

01:09:49.919 --> 01:09:51.320
ABOUT SUITABLE HOUSING. AND I

01:09:51.387 --> 01:09:52.588
KNOW AGAIN, I WANT TO REITERATE

01:09:52.655 --> 01:09:54.790
THAT IT'S ON THE ONE INDIVIDUAL

01:09:54.857 --> 01:09:56.258
MAKING THAT DECISION. THE JUDGE

01:09:56.325 --> 01:09:58.260
SEEMS TO BE UNFAIR THAT THOSE

01:09:58.327 --> 01:10:00.796
SUITABLE HOUSING ARE AREAS ARE

01:10:00.863 --> 01:10:02.331
IN AREAS THAT SOME OF US

01:10:02.398 --> 01:10:03.465
REPRESENT, WHICH ARE RURAL AND

01:10:03.532 --> 01:10:04.733
CONTINUE TO BE PLACEMENT FOR

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:07.436
THOSE THAT VIOLATE THEIR

01:10:07.503 --> 01:10:08.537
CONDITIONAL RELEASE. AND THEN

01:10:08.604 --> 01:10:10.439
THEY GET RELEASED AGAIN AND THEY

01:10:10.506 --> 01:10:11.907
COME BACK TO THE SAME AREA

01:10:11.974 --> 01:10:14.677
AGAIN, NOT ON YOU. THANK YOU.

01:10:14.743 --> 01:10:16.779
BEFORE WE GO TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER

01:10:16.845 --> 01:10:18.547
DEMAIO, SENATOR JONES, DID YOU

01:10:18.614 --> 01:10:19.415
WANT TO MAKE A CLARIFYING

01:10:19.481 --> 01:10:20.349
COMMENT? I JUST WANTED TO

01:10:20.416 --> 01:10:21.450
ADDRESS THE TRANSITIONAL

01:10:21.517 --> 01:10:23.919
HOUSING. I DO HAVE A BILL THAT

01:10:23.986 --> 01:10:24.620
IS NOW IN ASSEMBLY

01:10:24.687 --> 01:10:26.088
APPROPRIATIONS, SB 380 THAT WILL

01:10:26.155 --> 01:10:28.390
REQUIRE DEPARTMENT OF STATE

01:10:28.457 --> 01:10:30.392
HOSPITALS TO START CONSIDERING

01:10:30.459 --> 01:10:33.429
OR TO START DEVELOPING A PROGRAM

01:10:33.495 --> 01:10:34.964
FOR TRANSITIONAL HOUSING. SO I

01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:37.333
LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR SUPPORT ON

01:10:37.399 --> 01:10:39.034
THAT. ASSEMBLYMEMBER DEMAIO,

01:10:39.101 --> 01:10:41.670
THANK YOU. I TOO, HAD A PROBLEM

01:10:41.737 --> 01:10:42.972
WITH THE TITLE OF THIS REPORT

01:10:43.038 --> 01:10:45.240
BECAUSE I THINK IT DOES NOT.

01:10:45.307 --> 01:10:48.477
IT'S MISLEADING. IT DOESN'T EVEN

01:10:48.544 --> 01:10:50.379
IT'S NOT SUPPORTED BY YOUR OWN

01:10:50.446 --> 01:10:51.380
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY. AND I'M

01:10:51.447 --> 01:10:52.982
GLAD THAT YOU CLARIFIED THINGS,

01:10:53.048 --> 01:10:54.516
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, THE TITLE IS

01:10:54.583 --> 01:10:55.884
STILL THERE. AND I THINK PEOPLE,

01:10:55.951 --> 01:10:58.287
IF THEY JUST GLANCE AT IT, WILL

01:10:58.354 --> 01:10:59.121
THINK, OH, THIS IS A GREAT

01:10:59.188 --> 01:11:00.990
PROGRAM. I'VE SEEN A LOT OF BAD

01:11:01.056 --> 01:11:02.992
GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS IN MY DAY,

01:11:03.058 --> 01:11:03.626
SOME GOOD ONES TOO. BUT AS IT

01:11:03.692 --> 01:11:06.161
RELATES TO THE BAD ONES, THIS IS

01:11:06.228 --> 01:11:06.996
PERHAPS ONE OF THE WORST

01:11:07.062 --> 01:11:08.597
PROGRAMS I HAVE EVER COME

01:11:08.664 --> 01:11:11.133
ACROSS. NOT ONLY IS IT A

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:13.302
BOONDOGGLE, WASTE OF MONEY,

01:11:13.369 --> 01:11:15.537
HEMORRHAGING TAXPAYER MONEY, BUT

01:11:15.604 --> 01:11:18.007
IT IS A SEVERE RISK TO PUBLIC

01:11:18.073 --> 01:11:19.208
SAFETY. AND AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:11:19.274 --> 01:11:22.144
CARILLO POINTS OUT, SOMETHING IS

01:11:22.211 --> 01:11:25.080
COMPLETELY OFF WHEN YOU HAVE

01:11:25.147 --> 01:11:29.518
THIS CONSTANT PLACEMENT OF SB IN

01:11:29.585 --> 01:11:33.489
THE SAME AREAS SINCE 2015, 90%

01:11:33.555 --> 01:11:35.658
OF SVP'S HAVE BEEN RELEASED INTO

01:11:35.724 --> 01:11:37.726
SAN DIEGO COUNTY AND ALL BUT ONE

01:11:37.793 --> 01:11:39.461
OF THEM HAVE BEEN IN MY ASSEMBLY

01:11:39.528 --> 01:11:41.697
DISTRICT. LIKE ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:11:41.764 --> 01:11:43.499
CARRILLO, I REPRESENT A DISTRICT

01:11:43.565 --> 01:11:45.734
THAT HAS A LOT OF RURAL AREAS.

01:11:45.801 --> 01:11:47.403
AND WHILE YOU SAY THAT THE

01:11:47.469 --> 01:11:48.504
JUDGES ARE IN CHARGE OF

01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:51.006
PLACEMENT, THAT'S NOT TRUE. THE

01:11:51.073 --> 01:11:53.976
JUDGE HAS TO SIGN OFF, BUT THE

01:11:54.043 --> 01:11:56.612
JUDGE IS LEANING ON LIBERTY

01:11:56.679 --> 01:11:57.513
HEALTHCARE TO COME FORWARD AND

01:11:57.579 --> 01:11:59.448
SAY, HEY, HERE'S A PLACEMENT

01:11:59.515 --> 01:12:00.683
OPTION. AND SO TO SAY THAT IT'S

01:12:00.749 --> 01:12:02.317
THE JUDGE DECIDING, NO, IT'S

01:12:02.384 --> 01:12:03.986
LIBERTY HEALTHCARE GOING OUT

01:12:04.053 --> 01:12:06.155
THERE, TEEING UP A LOCATION AND

01:12:06.221 --> 01:12:08.424
THEN BRINGING IT BEFORE A JUDGE

01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:10.626
TO GET A FINAL APPROVAL. AND IT

01:12:10.693 --> 01:12:12.294
IS A BROKEN SYSTEM. IT DOES NOT

01:12:12.361 --> 01:12:14.029
WORK. THAT'S WHY I DO BELIEVE,

01:12:14.096 --> 01:12:16.198
AT THE VERY LEAST, WE NEED TO

01:12:16.265 --> 01:12:19.101
CONSIDER THE TRANSITORY HOUSING

01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:20.369
MODEL. BUT IN THE INTERIM, I

01:12:20.436 --> 01:12:23.072
THINK WE NEED TO PUT THIS ENTIRE

01:12:23.138 --> 01:12:26.675
PROGRAM ON SUSPENSE. THERE IS

01:12:26.742 --> 01:12:29.311
TOO MUCH MONEY BEING WASTED AND

01:12:29.378 --> 01:12:30.212
TOO MANY PLACEMENTS THAT ARE

01:12:30.279 --> 01:12:33.716
BEING DONE IN A HAPHAZARD WAY AS

01:12:33.782 --> 01:12:36.418
IT RELATES TO YOUR AUDIT

01:12:36.485 --> 01:12:38.854
METHODOLOGY, DID YOU TALK TO ANY

01:12:38.921 --> 01:12:40.289
OF THE HOMEOWNERS WHO CHANGED

01:12:40.355 --> 01:12:43.225
THEIR MINDS WHERE THEY WERE

01:12:43.292 --> 01:12:45.394
HOOKED BY LIBERTY HEALTHCARE ON

01:12:45.461 --> 01:12:47.863
SIGNING THESE VERY LAVISH

01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:49.765
LEASES, VERY EXPENSIVE LEASES,

01:12:49.832 --> 01:12:52.034
WAY ABOVE MARKET RATE, AND FOR

01:12:52.101 --> 01:12:53.402
SOME REASON THEY CHANGED THEIR

01:12:53.469 --> 01:12:54.937
MIND. SOMETHING MUST HAVE

01:12:55.003 --> 01:12:56.705
HAPPENED WITH THAT HOMEOWNER TO

01:12:56.772 --> 01:12:58.373
WALK AWAY FROM SO MUCH MONEY

01:12:58.440 --> 01:12:59.441
ABOVE MARKET RATE. DID YOU TALK

01:12:59.508 --> 01:13:01.643
TO ANY HOMEOWNERS WHO WALKED

01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:03.445
AWAY FROM THE PLACEMENT

01:13:03.512 --> 01:13:05.914
CONTRACTS THAT THEY SIGNED? WE

01:13:05.981 --> 01:13:07.716
DID WORK TO ANSWER THE AUDIT

01:13:07.783 --> 01:13:09.284
OBJECTIVES AS WE UNDERSTOOD

01:13:09.351 --> 01:13:10.753
THEM, BUT THE ANSWER IS NO TO

01:13:10.819 --> 01:13:12.488
YOUR QUESTION, BECAUSE IF YOU

01:13:12.554 --> 01:13:13.489
TALK TO THOSE HOMEOWNERS, YOU

01:13:13.555 --> 01:13:15.257
KNOW WHAT THEY'LL SAY. LIBERTY

01:13:15.324 --> 01:13:19.261
LIED. LIBERTY MISLED ME. I DID

01:13:19.328 --> 01:13:20.696
NOT KNOW WHAT I WAS SIGNING UP

01:13:20.763 --> 01:13:23.599
ON. AND IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT

01:13:23.665 --> 01:13:24.199
THE LAST SEVERAL PLACEMENTS,

01:13:24.266 --> 01:13:25.534
HALF OF THEM GOT PULLED. NOT BY

01:13:25.601 --> 01:13:28.604
THE JUDGE, BY THE HOMEOWNER WHO

01:13:28.670 --> 01:13:30.472
SAID, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THIS

01:13:30.539 --> 01:13:31.807
WAS WHAT I WAS SIGNING UP TO.

01:13:31.874 --> 01:13:33.275
AND YET, LIBERTY CONTINUES TO

01:13:33.342 --> 01:13:35.544
GET TAXPAYER MONEY FOR THESE

01:13:35.611 --> 01:13:37.479
BOGUS PLACEMENTS. DID YOU TALK

01:13:37.546 --> 01:13:39.348
TO ANY OF THE NEIGHBORS WHO

01:13:39.414 --> 01:13:41.583
OPPOSED THE PLACEMENT OF THESE

01:13:41.650 --> 01:13:42.351
INDIVIDUALS IN THEIR

01:13:42.417 --> 01:13:43.352
COMMUNITIES, WHETHER THE

01:13:43.418 --> 01:13:45.154
PLACEMENT WAS DEFEATED AND

01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:47.790
OVERRULED BY THE JUDGE, OR WAS

01:13:47.856 --> 01:13:49.224
APPROVED BY THE JUDGE? ANY

01:13:49.291 --> 01:13:51.260
NEIGHBORS, PEOPLE WHO LIVE ON

01:13:51.326 --> 01:13:53.428
THE SAME CITY BLOCK? OUR AUDIT

01:13:53.495 --> 01:13:55.030
FOCUSED ON THE HOUSING COMMITTEE

01:13:55.097 --> 01:13:56.598
AND THE COUNTY PARTICIPANTS ON

01:13:56.665 --> 01:13:58.200
THAT COMMITTEE, NOT THE

01:13:58.267 --> 01:13:59.434
NEIGHBORS. WHAT YOU'LL HEAR FROM

01:13:59.501 --> 01:14:00.702
THE NEIGHBORS IS THAT THEY HAD

01:14:00.769 --> 01:14:02.204
NO KNOWLEDGE WHATSOEVER. LIBERTY

01:14:02.271 --> 01:14:03.438
DIDN'T KNOCK ON A DOOR. LIBERTY

01:14:03.505 --> 01:14:05.474
DIDN'T GIVE THEM A WARNING. THEY

01:14:05.541 --> 01:14:06.809
DIDN'T SAY, HEY, THIS IS WHAT

01:14:06.875 --> 01:14:07.810
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT DOING. WHAT

01:14:07.876 --> 01:14:09.745
THEY FOUND OUT WAS LATER ON IN

01:14:09.812 --> 01:14:12.614
THE PROCESS, MAYBE THROUGH THE

01:14:12.681 --> 01:14:14.483
MEDIA, THAT THIS PLACEMENT WAS

01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:16.218
HAPPENING AGAIN. THAT IS

01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:16.985
ABSOLUTELY DISRESPECTFUL. IF

01:14:17.052 --> 01:14:18.587
WE'RE GOING TO OPERATE AS A

01:14:18.654 --> 01:14:20.522
GOVERNMENT, IT HAS TO BE AN OPEN

01:14:20.589 --> 01:14:22.958
AND TRANSPARENT PROCESS. AND

01:14:23.025 --> 01:14:25.527
AGAIN, TO MR. CARRILLO'S

01:14:25.594 --> 01:14:28.664
QUESTION, 90% IN SAN DIEGO

01:14:28.730 --> 01:14:30.966
COUNTY, ALL BUT ONE IN MY

01:14:31.033 --> 01:14:32.000
DISTRICT, WHICH OVERLAPS WITH

01:14:32.067 --> 01:14:34.837
SENATOR JONES'S DISTRICT. I

01:14:34.903 --> 01:14:36.305
UNDERSTAND THAT YOU SAY WAS THE

01:14:36.371 --> 01:14:37.606
JUDGES ARE THE ONES APPROVING

01:14:37.673 --> 01:14:39.141
IT, BUT A JUDGE CAN'T JUST

01:14:39.208 --> 01:14:40.442
DECIDE, WELL, I'M GOING TO GO

01:14:40.509 --> 01:14:42.110
OUT THERE AND INTERVIEW

01:14:42.177 --> 01:14:42.978
HOMEOWNERS AND FIGURE OUT WHERE

01:14:43.045 --> 01:14:44.413
TO PLACE THEM. AND SO I THINK

01:14:44.479 --> 01:14:46.615
THAT WE HAVE A FUNDAMENTALLY

01:14:46.682 --> 01:14:47.382
FLAWED PROGRAM. I DON'T THINK

01:14:47.449 --> 01:14:48.517
YOU CAN YOU CAN PUT A BAND-AID

01:14:48.584 --> 01:14:51.520
ON THIS ONE. I THINK WE NEED TO

01:14:51.587 --> 01:14:52.054
IMMEDIATELY SUSPEND THIS

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:52.855
PROGRAM. I AM CALLING ON

01:14:52.921 --> 01:14:55.724
GOVERNOR NEWSOM. NEWSOM, STOP

01:14:55.791 --> 01:14:57.492
PLACING SEXUALLY VIOLENT

01:14:57.559 --> 01:14:58.861
PREDATORS IN RESIDENTIAL

01:14:58.927 --> 01:15:01.396
COMMUNITIES. STOP. YOU HAVE THE

01:15:01.463 --> 01:15:04.066
POWER, GOVERNOR, TO STOP THIS

01:15:04.132 --> 01:15:06.134
PRACTICE. AND MY QUESTION, YOU

01:15:06.201 --> 01:15:08.737
KNOW, WILL REMAIN HOW MANY

01:15:08.804 --> 01:15:10.906
VICTIMS WILL RESULT FROM AN

01:15:10.973 --> 01:15:13.775
IMPROPER PLACEMENT? YOU DID

01:15:13.842 --> 01:15:18.080
POINT OUT THAT 18 OUT OF THE 56

01:15:18.146 --> 01:15:20.883
WERE FLAGGED FOR VIOLATIONS AND

01:15:20.949 --> 01:15:23.151
REMOVED FROM THE PROGRAM. AND IF

01:15:23.218 --> 01:15:24.720
YOU ADD THAT UP, AS SENATOR

01:15:24.786 --> 01:15:25.821
JONES POINTED OUT, IT'S 37%

01:15:25.888 --> 01:15:28.323
FAILURE RATE. AND SO I'M VERY

01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:29.524
WORRIED ABOUT PEOPLE WALKING

01:15:29.591 --> 01:15:31.827
AWAY WITH A FALSE IMPRESSION

01:15:31.894 --> 01:15:34.062
THAT SOMEHOW IF WE JUST IMPROVE

01:15:34.129 --> 01:15:36.732
THIS PROGRAM, THAT IT WORKS

01:15:36.798 --> 01:15:38.133
OVERALL, BUT WE JUST NEED

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:39.167
REFINEMENTS. THERE IS NO

01:15:39.234 --> 01:15:41.503
EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT

01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:42.905
RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITY PLACEMENT

01:15:42.971 --> 01:15:45.040
AND LIBERTY HEALTH CARE IS

01:15:45.107 --> 01:15:47.209
PROTECTING ANYONE. WHAT THERE IS

01:15:47.276 --> 01:15:48.677
EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST IS THAT IT'S

01:15:48.744 --> 01:15:50.712
UPSETTING A LOT OF COMMUNITIES,

01:15:50.779 --> 01:15:51.647
AND THE PROCESS ISN'T BEING DONE

01:15:51.713 --> 01:15:53.749
RIGHT. I THINK THE ONLY WAY TO

01:15:53.815 --> 01:15:55.584
SAVE SALVAGE THIS IS TO LOOK AT

01:15:55.651 --> 01:15:59.121
A TRANSITORY HOUSING MODEL

01:15:59.187 --> 01:16:01.256
FINAL, YOU KNOW, POINT TO, TO

01:16:01.323 --> 01:16:02.524
MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS CLEAR ON.

01:16:02.591 --> 01:16:04.326
YOU DIDN'T LOOK AT CHANGES IN

01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:06.929
STATE LAW. YOU TOOK WHAT STATE

01:16:06.995 --> 01:16:09.331
LAW CURRENTLY REQUIRES. AND YOU

01:16:09.398 --> 01:16:10.699
SAID, HOW IS THIS PROGRAM

01:16:10.766 --> 01:16:11.833
PERFORMING UNDER CURRENT STATE

01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:13.635
LAW? IS THAT CORRECT? WE ALSO

01:16:13.702 --> 01:16:15.370
MADE A RECOMMENDATION TO CHANGE

01:16:15.437 --> 01:16:16.772
STATE LAW WITH RESPECT TO

01:16:16.838 --> 01:16:18.106
TRANSITIONAL HOUSING. CORRECT.

01:16:18.173 --> 01:16:19.942
BUT AS IT RELATES TO THE

01:16:20.008 --> 01:16:23.245
FUNDAMENTAL PRACTICE OF HAVING

01:16:23.312 --> 01:16:25.414
PEOPLE PLACED IN RESIDENTIAL

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:26.315
COMMUNITIES, HAVING THEM PLACED

01:16:26.381 --> 01:16:28.617
IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO TRIBAL

01:16:28.684 --> 01:16:31.820
NATIONS WITHOUT CONSULTATION,

01:16:31.887 --> 01:16:33.388
NONE OF THAT WAS CONSIDERED IN

01:16:33.455 --> 01:16:35.624
TERMS OF YOUR AUDIT CRITERIA.

01:16:35.691 --> 01:16:36.725
I'M NOT SURE I WOULD AGREE WITH

01:16:36.792 --> 01:16:38.393
THAT. WE HAD OBJECTIVES FROM

01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:39.528
SENATOR JONES THAT ASKED US TO

01:16:39.594 --> 01:16:42.297
GO INTO HOW IS THE COMMUNITY

01:16:42.364 --> 01:16:44.066
HOUSING COMMITTEE PROCESS

01:16:44.132 --> 01:16:45.667
WORKING? DURING OUR AUDIT

01:16:45.734 --> 01:16:46.735
PERIOD, WE SELECTED THREE

01:16:46.802 --> 01:16:48.203
COUNTIES AS REQUIRED BY THAT

01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:50.205
AUDIT. WE SPOKE TO THE OFFICIALS

01:16:50.272 --> 01:16:52.007
THAT PARTICIPATED ON THOSE

01:16:52.074 --> 01:16:53.475
COMMITTEES FROM THOSE LOCAL

01:16:53.542 --> 01:16:54.810
JURISDICTIONS, AND WE GOT THEIR

01:16:54.876 --> 01:16:56.511
PERSPECTIVES ON HOW THAT

01:16:56.578 --> 01:16:58.146
COMMITTEE PLACEMENT PROCESS WAS

01:16:58.213 --> 01:17:00.282
WORKING. I WOULD HOPE THAT,

01:17:00.349 --> 01:17:02.451
GIVEN THE FEEDBACK IN YOUR

01:17:02.517 --> 01:17:04.319
TESTIMONY THAT YOU MAY I KNOW

01:17:04.386 --> 01:17:06.421
YOU DON'T DO THIS VERY OFTEN. I

01:17:06.488 --> 01:17:07.456
DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER DONE

01:17:07.522 --> 01:17:11.860
IT, BUT THAT YOU MAY REFINE THE

01:17:11.927 --> 01:17:14.696
TITLE AND THE SUBTITLE AND THE

01:17:14.763 --> 01:17:16.064
FALSE IMPRESSION. THIS REPORT

01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:17.599
LEAVES THAT SOMEHOW THAT THIS IS

01:17:17.666 --> 01:17:20.068
AN EFFECTIVE PROGRAM. I THINK NO

01:17:20.135 --> 01:17:23.372
EVIDENCE EXISTS TO CALL IT AN

01:17:23.438 --> 01:17:24.439
EFFECTIVE PROGRAM IN TERMS OF

01:17:24.506 --> 01:17:28.443
PUBLIC SAFETY. THANK YOU, MR.

01:17:28.510 --> 01:17:31.179
SENATOR VALLADARES. THANK YOU,

01:17:31.246 --> 01:17:36.385
MR. CHAIR. SO WHAT I THINK IS

01:17:36.451 --> 01:17:38.086
IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF THE MAKEUP

01:17:38.153 --> 01:17:39.988
OF THIS COMMITTEE, CAN YOU HEAR

01:17:40.055 --> 01:17:41.757
ME? WHAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT IN

01:17:41.823 --> 01:17:43.225
THE MAKEUP OF THIS COMMITTEE IS

01:17:43.291 --> 01:17:45.327
YOU HAVE LEGISLATORS HERE WHOSE

01:17:45.394 --> 01:17:47.696
COMMUNITIES ARE BEING

01:17:47.763 --> 01:17:48.296
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY

01:17:48.363 --> 01:17:51.199
THE PLACEMENT OF SVP'S. I

01:17:51.266 --> 01:17:53.602
REPRESENT THE HIGH DESERT AREA,

01:17:53.668 --> 01:17:55.771
ADELANTO, VICTORVILLE, PALMDALE,

01:17:55.837 --> 01:17:59.408
LANCASTER. AND SINCE 2021, EVERY

01:17:59.474 --> 01:18:01.743
SINGLE SVP IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY

01:18:01.810 --> 01:18:03.612
HAS BEEN PLACED IN THE ANTELOPE

01:18:03.678 --> 01:18:06.281
VALLEY. WE ARE MORE THAN

01:18:06.348 --> 01:18:07.382
FRUSTRATED. MY COMMUNITY LIVES

01:18:07.449 --> 01:18:10.252
IN FEAR, AND SOMETIMES THEY FEEL

01:18:10.318 --> 01:18:11.453
LIKE THEY DON'T HAVE A VOICE AND

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:13.422
THEY'RE BECOMING THE SVP ZONE OF

01:18:13.488 --> 01:18:16.658
LOS ANGELES COUNTY. SO THE DATA

01:18:16.725 --> 01:18:19.661
IN YOUR REPORT IS VERY IMPORTANT

01:18:19.728 --> 01:18:21.430
TO US BECAUSE OUR COMMUNITIES

01:18:21.496 --> 01:18:24.032
ARE IMPACTED AND WE'RE GOING TO

01:18:24.099 --> 01:18:25.467
HOPEFULLY LEGISLATE AND CREATE

01:18:25.534 --> 01:18:28.970
SOME POLICY THAT PROTECTS OUR

01:18:29.037 --> 01:18:33.108
COMMUNITIES. SO. HOW IN SPECIFIC

01:18:33.175 --> 01:18:34.843
TO ASK SOME SPECIFIC QUESTIONS

01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:37.512
ABOUT THE NUMBERS, HOW MANY SVP

01:18:37.579 --> 01:18:39.448
OF THE 56 THAT HAVE BEEN PLACED

01:18:39.514 --> 01:18:42.551
HAVE BEEN PLACED IN L.A. COUNTY

01:18:42.617 --> 01:18:46.221
AND IN THE HIGH DESERT REGION?

01:18:46.288 --> 01:18:48.290
WE HAVE A TO ANSWER THAT, BEN.

01:18:48.356 --> 01:18:51.960
DO YOU KNOW SO WE DON'T HAVE THE

01:18:52.027 --> 01:18:53.295
BREAKDOWN OF ALL OF THOSE

01:18:53.361 --> 01:18:54.963
NUMBERS. AND PART OF IT WAS A

01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:56.231
LIMITATION OF WHAT WE WERE

01:18:56.298 --> 01:18:58.166
ALLOWED TO LEGALLY REPORT. WE

01:18:58.233 --> 01:19:00.502
HAD TWO SOURCES OF INFORMATION.

01:19:00.569 --> 01:19:03.105
ONE SOURCE WAS DEPARTMENT OF

01:19:03.171 --> 01:19:05.207
STATE HOSPITALS, WHICH IS A

01:19:05.273 --> 01:19:07.075
HOSPITAL, AND IT'S CONSIDERED

01:19:07.142 --> 01:19:09.010
MEDICAL RECORDS. SO WE HAD TO

01:19:09.077 --> 01:19:10.645
LIMIT THE LEVEL OF INFORMATION.

01:19:10.712 --> 01:19:12.747
YEAH. SO IN THE AUDIT REPORT, I

01:19:12.814 --> 01:19:16.785
THINK WE TALK ABOUT HOW AS OF

01:19:16.852 --> 01:19:17.919
APRIL 2024, THERE WERE ROUGHLY

01:19:17.986 --> 01:19:19.421
19 INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE PLACED

01:19:19.488 --> 01:19:21.823
IN THE COMMUNITY AT THAT TIME.

01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:23.725
WE HAVE AN APPENDIX IN THE BACK

01:19:23.792 --> 01:19:25.794
OF THE AUDIT REPORT THAT TALKS

01:19:25.861 --> 01:19:27.329
ABOUT WHAT COUNTIES WERE, WHERE

01:19:27.395 --> 01:19:29.431
THERE WERE PLACEMENT FOR 17 OF

01:19:29.498 --> 01:19:31.466
THOSE 19 INDIVIDUALS. WITH

01:19:31.533 --> 01:19:33.001
RESPECT TO LOS ANGELES COUNTY,

01:19:33.068 --> 01:19:35.470
THERE WERE TWO, WHICH WERE BOTH

01:19:35.537 --> 01:19:38.306
IN THE ANTELOPE VALLEY. OUR

01:19:38.373 --> 01:19:40.308
REPORT DOESN'T GO INTO DETAIL ON

01:19:40.375 --> 01:19:41.343
THE SPECIFIC LOCATIONS. AND

01:19:41.409 --> 01:19:42.544
THERE WERE TWO PLACEMENTS THAT

01:19:42.611 --> 01:19:45.046
WE DON'T DISCLOSE IN THAT TABLE,

01:19:45.113 --> 01:19:47.249
BECAUSE NOT ALL OF THE COURT

01:19:47.315 --> 01:19:48.016
RECORDS THAT WE LOOKED AT ARE

01:19:48.083 --> 01:19:50.218
CONSIDERED PUBLIC INFORMATION.

01:19:50.285 --> 01:19:52.154
SOME OF THOSE COURT ORDERS ARE

01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:53.755
NONPUBLIC CONFIDENTIAL

01:19:53.822 --> 01:19:58.860
DOCUMENTS. SO IN YOUR AUDIT DOES

01:19:58.927 --> 01:20:00.962
OR FROM YOUR AUDIT, ARE THERE

01:20:01.029 --> 01:20:03.064
ANY EXISTING STATE POLICIES

01:20:03.131 --> 01:20:06.134
RIGHT NOW THAT ENSURE EQUITABLE

01:20:06.201 --> 01:20:08.036
GEOGRAPHIC, GEOGRAPHIC

01:20:08.103 --> 01:20:10.639
DISBURSEMENT, DISBURSEMENT OF

01:20:10.705 --> 01:20:15.310
SVP'S? STATE AND I THINK STATE

01:20:15.377 --> 01:20:16.778
HOSPITALS WOULD BE ABLE TO

01:20:16.845 --> 01:20:17.879
ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IN MORE

01:20:17.946 --> 01:20:19.514
DEPTH, BUT I BELIEVE EXISTING

01:20:19.581 --> 01:20:21.516
LAW CURRENTLY PRESCRIBES A

01:20:21.583 --> 01:20:23.251
PRETTY DETAILED PROCESS ABOUT

01:20:23.318 --> 01:20:25.820
HOW YOU DETERMINE THE COUNTY OF

01:20:25.887 --> 01:20:27.189
COMMITMENT, THE COUNTY OF

01:20:27.255 --> 01:20:29.191
PLACEMENT, WHAT FACTORS JUDGES

01:20:29.257 --> 01:20:30.825
ARE SUPPOSED TO CONSIDER WHEN

01:20:30.892 --> 01:20:32.327
DECIDING WHEN TO PLACE SVP'S IN

01:20:32.394 --> 01:20:34.329
THE COMMUNITY. ONE OF THE THINGS

01:20:34.396 --> 01:20:36.231
THAT OUR AUDIT DID NOT DO, AND

01:20:36.298 --> 01:20:38.133
NOR WERE WE ASKED TO DO IT, WAS

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:39.334
TO EVALUATE HOW JUDGES WERE

01:20:39.401 --> 01:20:41.536
MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT WHERE TO

01:20:41.603 --> 01:20:45.173
PLACE SVP'S IN THE COMMUNITY. SO

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:49.945
IN THE PLACEMENT PROCESS, DO OUR

01:20:50.011 --> 01:20:51.313
LOCAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

01:20:51.379 --> 01:20:53.148
AUTHORITIES, ARE THEY GIVEN

01:20:53.215 --> 01:20:54.516
INPUT ON WHETHER OR NOT A

01:20:54.583 --> 01:20:57.319
PROPOSED PLACEMENT HAS ADEQUATE

01:20:57.385 --> 01:21:01.990
SUPPORT SERVICES? THERE IS A

01:21:02.057 --> 01:21:03.258
HOUSING COMMITTEE THAT ADVISES

01:21:03.325 --> 01:21:06.962
DSH AND BEN, I DON'T KNOW IF

01:21:07.028 --> 01:21:08.263
YOU'RE ABLE TO GO INTO FURTHER

01:21:08.330 --> 01:21:10.532
DETAIL, BUT I DO BELIEVE WE HAVE

01:21:10.599 --> 01:21:12.133
A TABLE IN OUR REPORT THAT TALKS

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:12.867
ABOUT THE FACTORS THAT THEY

01:21:12.934 --> 01:21:14.769
CONSIDER WHEN MAKING PLACEMENT

01:21:14.836 --> 01:21:16.538
DECISIONS. ONE OF THOSE, I

01:21:16.605 --> 01:21:18.006
BELIEVE, IS CONSIDERING, YOU

01:21:18.073 --> 01:21:19.474
KNOW, AVAILABILITY OF TREATMENT

01:21:19.541 --> 01:21:21.576
SERVICES. ANOTHER ONE WOULD BE

01:21:21.643 --> 01:21:24.446
ACCESS TO A GPS TRACKING DETAIL

01:21:24.512 --> 01:21:26.681
SO THAT THE PLACEMENT OF THESE

01:21:26.748 --> 01:21:28.550
SVP'S IN, IN THE COMMUNITY COULD

01:21:28.617 --> 01:21:29.551
BE MONITORED. BUT THERE'S A

01:21:29.618 --> 01:21:30.752
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT

01:21:30.819 --> 01:21:32.520
GO INTO THE CONSIDERATION OF

01:21:32.587 --> 01:21:35.557
WHERE AN SVP IS PLACED. WHAT'S

01:21:35.624 --> 01:21:37.826
DEEPLY CONCERNING TO ME IS I

01:21:37.892 --> 01:21:39.928
DON'T THINK ANY OF THAT IS

01:21:39.995 --> 01:21:41.329
ACTUALLY BEING UTILIZED. AND WE

01:21:41.396 --> 01:21:43.265
SEE IT IN OUR COMMUNITY, BECAUSE

01:21:43.331 --> 01:21:46.167
IF YOU LOOK AT THE SPECIFICS, WE

01:21:46.234 --> 01:21:47.435
LIVE IN WHAT'S KNOWN AS A

01:21:47.502 --> 01:21:49.738
HEALTHCARE DESERT. WE DON'T HAVE

01:21:49.804 --> 01:21:51.139
ADEQUATE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

01:21:51.206 --> 01:21:53.541
SERVICES YET ALONE. THE ABILITY

01:21:53.608 --> 01:21:56.444
OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TO REPORT TO

01:21:56.511 --> 01:21:59.147
THESE AREAS. IN JUNIPER HILLS,

01:21:59.214 --> 01:22:02.017
THERE WAS A OUR OUR SHERIFF

01:22:02.083 --> 01:22:04.119
NOTED WHEN WE HAD ONE OF THE

01:22:04.185 --> 01:22:05.787
LAST SVP'S PLACED THERE THIS

01:22:05.854 --> 01:22:08.356
PAST MARCH, THAT A NORMAL

01:22:08.423 --> 01:22:10.592
ROUTINE CALL TAKES THE SHERIFF'S

01:22:10.659 --> 01:22:12.394
DEPARTMENT ABOUT TWO HOURS TO

01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:15.297
RESPOND TO A PRIORITY CALL 45

01:22:15.363 --> 01:22:19.067
MINUTES. SO I THINK WE HAVE SOME

01:22:19.134 --> 01:22:22.837
SERIOUS CONCERNS WITH NOT ONLY

01:22:22.904 --> 01:22:24.939
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS

01:22:25.006 --> 01:22:25.573
PROGRAM, BECAUSE OUR COMMUNITIES

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:28.476
ARE BEING IMPACTED, BUT SOME

01:22:28.543 --> 01:22:32.681
SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT WHY OUR

01:22:32.747 --> 01:22:33.882
COMMUNITIES ARE BEING THE

01:22:33.948 --> 01:22:35.784
DUMPING GROUNDS FOR SVP'S. THANK

01:22:35.850 --> 01:22:38.987
YOU. THANK YOU, SENATOR. ANY

01:22:39.054 --> 01:22:41.690
OTHER QUESTIONS FOR OUR AUDITOR

01:22:41.756 --> 01:22:43.091
BEFORE WE TRANSITION TO THE NEXT

01:22:43.158 --> 01:22:46.161
PANEL? I WANT TO JUST SAY THANK

01:22:46.227 --> 01:22:48.229
YOU TO BOTH OF YOU FOR BEING

01:22:48.296 --> 01:22:49.431
HERE AND PRESENT. I THINK THERE

01:22:49.497 --> 01:22:51.166
WERE SOME VERY GOOD QUESTIONS,

01:22:51.232 --> 01:22:52.667
MANY OF WHICH I AGREE WITH. I

01:22:52.734 --> 01:22:54.369
GUESS MY LAST ONE BEFORE YOU

01:22:54.436 --> 01:22:55.203
LEAVE. OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS AN

01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:57.806
EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE PROGRAM,

01:22:57.872 --> 01:22:59.841
$1.6 MILLION PER YEAR PER

01:22:59.908 --> 01:23:01.209
PARTICIPANT I THINK IS A NUMBER

01:23:01.276 --> 01:23:03.978
THAT I READ. DO WE HAVE A COST

01:23:04.045 --> 01:23:05.313
COMPARISON BETWEEN THOSE WHO ARE

01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:06.348
IN THE CONDITIONAL RELEASE

01:23:06.414 --> 01:23:07.482
PROGRAM? SO THE INDIVIDUALS THAT

01:23:07.549 --> 01:23:08.750
GO THROUGH THIS PROGRAM VERSUS

01:23:08.817 --> 01:23:10.285
THOSE THAT JUST STAY IN STATE

01:23:10.352 --> 01:23:11.753
HOSPITALS, WHAT THE COST IS FOR

01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:15.490
THE STATE IN COMPARISON, IF THEY

01:23:15.557 --> 01:23:18.059
STAY VERSUS THEY GO INTO THIS

01:23:18.126 --> 01:23:22.497
PROGRAM. WE DON'T HAVE A COST

01:23:22.564 --> 01:23:23.798
COMPARISON. IN OUR AUDIT REPORT,

01:23:23.865 --> 01:23:26.434
THE 1.6 MILLION PER YEAR THAT

01:23:26.501 --> 01:23:28.169
YOU REFERENCED, I DON'T BELIEVE

01:23:28.236 --> 01:23:30.138
IS ACCURATE. I THINK IT'S 1.6

01:23:30.205 --> 01:23:32.574
MILLION PER SVP OVER THE 20

01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:34.442
YEARS ON AVERAGE. I THINK IT

01:23:34.509 --> 01:23:38.780
GETS CLOSER TO $200,000 PER YEAR

01:23:38.847 --> 01:23:40.148
OR SOMETHING. IF YOU LOOK AT

01:23:40.215 --> 01:23:42.317
SOME OF THE OTHER TABLES IN OUR

01:23:42.384 --> 01:23:43.385
REPORT, NOT TO TAKE AWAY FROM

01:23:43.451 --> 01:23:45.153
YOUR POINT THAT IT IS AN

01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:45.754
EXPENSIVE PROGRAM, I AGREE.

01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:47.589
YEAH, I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT. IT

01:23:47.655 --> 01:23:49.557
WASN'T PER YEAR, BUT IT WAS OVER

01:23:49.624 --> 01:23:51.025
THE LIFETIME, SO I APPRECIATE

01:23:51.092 --> 01:23:51.659
THAT CLARIFICATION. APPRECIATE

01:23:51.726 --> 01:23:52.460
YOU BEING HERE. AND OBVIOUSLY

01:23:52.527 --> 01:23:53.461
WE'LL WE'LL TRANSITION TO THE

01:23:53.528 --> 01:23:55.397
NEXT PANEL. AND IF YOU IF YOU

01:23:55.463 --> 01:23:57.198
ARE ABLE TO STAY THAT WOULD BE

01:23:57.265 --> 01:23:58.333
GREAT. BUT UNDERSTAND IF YOU

01:23:58.400 --> 01:23:59.601
HAVE TO LEAVE. SO THANK YOU

01:28:21.362 --> 01:28:22.864
FOR INDIVIDUALS TO REINTEGRATE

01:28:22.930 --> 01:28:24.232
INTO THE COMMUNITY. WHEN A COURT

01:28:24.298 --> 01:28:25.633
HAS DETERMINED IT IS SAFE AND

01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:27.068
APPROPRIATE TO DO SO, AS

01:28:27.135 --> 01:28:29.937
REQUIRED BY THE SVP ACT, THE

01:28:30.004 --> 01:28:31.205
DEPARTMENT IS HEAVILY INVOLVED

01:28:31.272 --> 01:28:32.674
IN THE OPERATION OF THE PROGRAM

AND PROVIDES CLOSE OVERSIGHT OF

01:28:34.308 --> 01:28:35.810
LIBERTY HEALTHCARE IN THE

PERFORMANCE OF THEIR DUTIES. THE

01:28:38.012 --> 01:28:39.647
TEAM IS INVOLVED IN DAILY

01:28:39.714 --> 01:28:41.182
DISCUSSIONS REGARDING CLIENT

01:28:48.389 --> 01:28:49.524
PARTICIPATES IN WEEKLY

01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:50.525
COORDINATION MEETINGS WITH

01:28:50.591 --> 01:28:52.226
LIBERTY, CONDUCTS QUARTERLY

01:28:52.293 --> 01:28:54.996
REVIEWS AND SITE VISITS, AND

01:28:55.063 --> 01:28:56.030
PROVIDES AFTER HOURS SUPPORT AS

01:28:56.097 --> 01:28:58.866
WELL. THE CONREP CONREP IS THE

01:28:58.933 --> 01:29:00.201
SAFEST DISCHARGE PATHWAY FROM

01:29:00.268 --> 01:29:02.370
THE STATE HOSPITAL BACK INTO THE

01:29:02.437 --> 01:29:03.471
COMMUNITY. INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE

01:29:03.538 --> 01:29:05.640
BEEN TREATED IN CONREP PRESENT

01:29:05.707 --> 01:29:07.241
LOWER RECIDIVISM RATES COMPARED

01:29:07.308 --> 01:29:08.910
TO THOSE UNCONDITIONALLY

01:29:08.976 --> 01:29:10.678
RELEASED FROM THE STATE

AN SVP PATIENT TO BE RELEASED TO

01:29:15.817 --> 01:29:17.452
THE CONREP SVP PROGRAM IS

01:29:17.518 --> 01:29:19.187
THROUGH A COURT ORDER. WHEN THE

01:29:19.253 --> 01:29:21.155
COURT HAS DETERMINED THAT THE

01:29:21.222 --> 01:29:23.825
INDIVIDUAL TO NOT BE A DANGER TO

UNDER SUPERVISION AND TREATMENT

01:29:28.663 --> 01:29:30.431
IN THE COMMUNITY, THE COURT

01:29:30.498 --> 01:29:32.567
ORDERS THE SPECIFIC TERMS AND

01:29:32.633 --> 01:29:33.668

THEIR TERMS AND CONDITIONS WHILE

01:29:42.844 --> 01:29:44.412
LIVING IN THE COMMUNITY CAN BE

01:29:44.479 --> 01:29:46.013
REVOKED. BACK TO THE STATE

01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:48.082
HOSPITAL OVER THE LIFE OF THE

01:29:48.149 --> 01:29:50.685
PROGRAM, THE AVERAGE TIME FROM

01:29:50.752 --> 01:29:53.855
SVP COMMITMENT TO DSH TO CONREP

01:29:53.921 --> 01:29:56.090
RELEASE IS ABOUT 12 YEARS, AND

01:29:56.157 --> 01:29:57.792
FOR THOSE CURRENTLY ORDERED OUT

01:29:57.859 --> 01:29:58.826
TO THE CONREP PROGRAM IN

01:29:58.893 --> 01:30:01.162
AWAITING PLACEMENT, 43% HAVE

01:30:01.229 --> 01:30:02.330
BEEN IN THE STATE HOSPITAL FOR

01:30:02.396 --> 01:30:04.465
MORE THAN 20 YEARS. THIS TIME IS

01:30:04.532 --> 01:30:06.601
IN ADDITION TO THE TIME THAT

01:30:06.667 --> 01:30:08.803
THEY SERVED IN PRISON FOR THEIR

01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:12.140
CRIME. VERY FEW SVP PATIENTS

01:30:12.206 --> 01:30:14.008
ULTIMATELY ACHIEVE CONDITIONAL

01:30:14.075 --> 01:30:15.476
RELEASE. SINCE THE INCEPTION OF

01:30:15.543 --> 01:30:17.979
THE PROGRAM IN 1996, THERE HAVE

01:30:18.045 --> 01:30:20.047
BEEN NOW A TOTAL OF 60

01:30:20.114 --> 01:30:21.883
INDIVIDUALS RELEASED TO CONREP.

01:30:21.949 --> 01:30:24.519
CURRENTLY, THERE ARE 21 CLIENTS

01:30:24.585 --> 01:30:26.320
LIVING IN COMMUNITY STATEWIDE,

01:30:26.387 --> 01:30:27.922
AND FOR COMPARISON, WE CURRENTLY

01:30:27.989 --> 01:30:30.324
HAVE 954 INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE

01:30:30.391 --> 01:30:33.361
BEEN COMMITTED TO DSH, DSHS,

01:30:33.427 --> 01:30:34.829
STATE HOSPITAL AND COALINGA

01:30:34.896 --> 01:30:37.498
UNDER THE SVP ACT. LASTLY, I

01:30:37.565 --> 01:30:39.567
WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE SVP

01:30:39.634 --> 01:30:41.402
COMMITMENT PROGRAM HAS BEEN

01:30:41.469 --> 01:30:42.970
FOUND BY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME

01:30:43.037 --> 01:30:45.373
COURT TO BE CONSTITUTIONAL

01:30:45.439 --> 01:30:47.175
BECAUSE THERE IS A PATHWAY FOR

01:30:47.241 --> 01:30:48.309
OUTPATIENT TREATMENT AND RELEASE

01:30:48.376 --> 01:30:51.012
BACK TO THE COMMUNITY VIA OUR

01:30:51.078 --> 01:30:52.513
PROGRAM. NOW MOVING ON TO THE

01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:54.682
AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS. IT IS. IN

01:30:54.749 --> 01:30:56.050
ITS REPORT, THE STATE AUDITOR

01:30:56.117 --> 01:30:59.020
MADE FIVE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE

01:30:59.086 --> 01:30:59.954
FOUR RECOMMENDATIONS THAT DSH

01:31:00.021 --> 01:31:01.823
AGREED TO IMPLEMENT. ALL HAVE

01:31:01.889 --> 01:31:03.658
BEEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED IN

01:31:03.724 --> 01:31:05.059
ACCORDANCE WITH THE TIMELINES

01:31:05.126 --> 01:31:06.561
THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE

01:31:06.627 --> 01:31:08.162
REPORT. THE DEPARTMENT DEVELOPED

01:31:08.229 --> 01:31:09.797
AND IMPLEMENTED GUIDANCE FOR THE

01:31:09.864 --> 01:31:11.632
HOUSING COMMITTEE DESIGNEES. IN

01:31:11.699 --> 01:31:14.135
NOVEMBER OF 2024, IT CONDUCTED A

01:31:14.202 --> 01:31:16.270
FORMAL PROGRAM REVIEW OF LIBERTY

01:31:16.337 --> 01:31:18.506
HEALTHCARE IN FEBRUARY OF 2025,

01:31:18.573 --> 01:31:20.208
AND HAS DETERMINED THAT IT WILL

01:31:20.274 --> 01:31:22.176
CONDUCT FORMAL PROGRAM REVIEWS

01:31:22.243 --> 01:31:24.278
ON A GOING FORWARD BASIS EVERY

01:31:24.345 --> 01:31:25.980
TWO YEARS. THE DEPARTMENT ALSO

01:31:26.047 --> 01:31:27.515
DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED A

01:31:27.582 --> 01:31:29.317
PROCESS TO TRACK THE OUTCOMES

01:31:29.383 --> 01:31:30.751
FROM FORMAL AND QUARTERLY

01:31:30.818 --> 01:31:32.553
PROGRAM REVIEWS. THE NEW OUTCOME

01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:33.888
TRACKER WAS IMPLEMENTED IN

01:31:33.955 --> 01:31:35.923
DECEMBER OF 2024, AND LASTLY,

01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:37.892
THE DEPARTMENT FINALIZED AN

01:31:37.959 --> 01:31:40.828
ANALYSIS IN MARCH 2025 ON

01:31:40.895 --> 01:31:42.196
UTILIZING SEPARATE CONTRACTS FOR

01:31:42.263 --> 01:31:43.998
SPECIFIC SERVICES PERFORMED BY

01:31:44.065 --> 01:31:46.100
LIBERTY AND EVALUATED THE COST

01:31:46.167 --> 01:31:47.869
EFFECTIVENESS EFFECTIVENESS OF

01:31:47.935 --> 01:31:49.470
ABSORBING SOME OF THOSE

01:31:49.537 --> 01:31:50.438
CONTRACTED ACTIVITIES INTERNALLY

01:31:50.504 --> 01:31:54.041
AS WELL. WITH RESPECT TO THE

01:31:54.108 --> 01:31:55.276
STATE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATION

01:31:55.343 --> 01:31:57.311
NUMBER TWO, WHICH WAS THAT DSH

01:31:57.378 --> 01:31:58.713
SHOULD EXPLORE ESTABLISHING

01:31:58.779 --> 01:32:00.548
STATE OWNED TRANSITIONAL HOUSING

01:32:00.615 --> 01:32:02.016
SIMILAR TO OTHER STATES, BY

01:32:02.083 --> 01:32:04.552
SEPTEMBER OF 2025. WE FORMALLY

01:32:04.619 --> 01:32:05.987
DISAGREED WITH THIS

01:32:06.053 --> 01:32:07.288
RECOMMENDATION, AS TRANSITIONAL

01:32:07.355 --> 01:32:08.589
HOUSING WOULD NOT ADDRESS MANY

01:32:08.656 --> 01:32:10.391
OF THE CHALLENGES THAT CURRENTLY

01:32:10.458 --> 01:32:12.126
EXIST THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE

01:32:12.193 --> 01:32:13.194
LENGTHY AVERAGE TIME TO

01:32:13.261 --> 01:32:14.729
PLACEMENT IN THE COMMUNITY, AND,

01:32:14.795 --> 01:32:16.731
WE BELIEVE, COULD FURTHER DELAY

01:32:16.797 --> 01:32:18.933
PLACEMENTS OF INDIVIDUALS. WE

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.068
ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE HOUSING

01:32:21.135 --> 01:32:22.603
FACILITY UTILIZED BY THE STATE

01:32:22.670 --> 01:32:24.338
OF WASHINGTON. THAT HAS BEEN

01:32:24.405 --> 01:32:26.440
CITED AS AN EXAMPLE TO CONSIDER

01:32:26.507 --> 01:32:27.942
FOR CALIFORNIA. DSH INFORMALLY

01:32:28.009 --> 01:32:30.077
MET WITH WASHINGTON STATE

01:32:30.144 --> 01:32:31.612
CONTACTS PRIOR TO THE AUDIT TO

01:32:31.679 --> 01:32:33.014
LEARN MORE ABOUT THEIR MODEL,

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:35.216
AND FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS, WE

01:32:35.283 --> 01:32:36.250
DETERMINED THAT THIS TYPE OF

01:32:36.317 --> 01:32:37.852
FACILITY WOULD NOT FIX A NUMBER

01:32:37.919 --> 01:32:39.654
OF THE CHALLENGES WE EXPERIENCE

01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:41.989
IN PLACING INDIVIDUALS INTO THE

01:32:42.056 --> 01:32:43.557
COMMUNITY, AND SOME OF THOSE

01:32:43.624 --> 01:32:45.126
REASONS INCLUDE THAT SITING

01:32:45.192 --> 01:32:46.594
LOCATIONS FOR TRANSITIONAL

01:32:46.661 --> 01:32:48.963
FACILITIES TO HOUSE MULTIPLE

01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:49.964
INDIVIDUALS IN ONE FACILITY

01:32:50.031 --> 01:32:51.699
WOULD NOT BE EASIER, AND LIKELY

01:32:51.766 --> 01:32:53.234
WOULD BE MORE DIFFICULT THAN FOR

01:32:53.301 --> 01:32:55.036
THE CURRENT TYPES OF

01:32:55.102 --> 01:32:56.037
INDIVIDUALS. PLACEMENTS

01:32:56.103 --> 01:32:58.506
UTILIZED. STATUTORY RESIDENCY

01:32:58.572 --> 01:33:00.775
RESTRICTIONS AND INDIVIDUAL RISK

01:33:00.841 --> 01:33:02.343
FACTORS CONTINUE TO MAKE CERTAIN

01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:03.477
AREAS OF THE STATE UNSUITABLE

01:33:03.544 --> 01:33:05.346
FOR THIS TYPE OF FACILITY. THERE

01:33:05.413 --> 01:33:06.647
WOULD ALSO STILL BE THE RISK

01:33:06.714 --> 01:33:08.249
THAT HOME SCHOOLS, OTHER PRIVATE

01:33:08.316 --> 01:33:10.184
OR PUBLIC SCHOOLS OR PARKS BEING

01:33:10.251 --> 01:33:11.919
DEVELOPED IN THE VICINITY OF ANY

01:33:11.986 --> 01:33:12.787
TRANSITIONAL FACILITY WE

01:33:12.853 --> 01:33:14.021
DEVELOPED COULD RENDER IT

01:33:14.088 --> 01:33:15.856
UNUSABLE FOR THIS PURPOSE AT ANY

01:33:15.923 --> 01:33:17.825
TIME. COMMUNITY PROTESTS OVER

01:33:17.892 --> 01:33:19.827
THE POTENTIAL PLACEMENT OF

01:33:19.894 --> 01:33:21.662
MULTIPLE INDIVIDUALS DESIGNATED

01:33:21.729 --> 01:33:23.698
AS AN SVP IN ONE FACILITY,

01:33:23.764 --> 01:33:25.866
LOCATION IN A COMMUNITY, OR IN

01:33:25.933 --> 01:33:27.335
ONE COUNTY WOULD BE EXPECTED,

01:33:27.401 --> 01:33:29.003
THUS DELAYING THE DEVELOPMENT OF

01:33:29.070 --> 01:33:32.406
A FACILITY OF THIS TYPE. ABSENT

01:33:32.473 --> 01:33:33.574
EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES, THE

01:33:33.641 --> 01:33:35.676
LAW REQUIRES THAT INDIVIDUALS BE

01:33:35.743 --> 01:33:37.378
PLACED INTO THEIR COUNTY OF

01:33:37.445 --> 01:33:38.946
DOMICILE, AND FOR MOST COUNTIES,

01:33:39.013 --> 01:33:41.148
THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH INDIVIDUALS

01:33:41.215 --> 01:33:43.117
TO SUPPORT ESTABLISHING AN SVP

01:33:43.184 --> 01:33:45.086
TRANSITIONAL FACILITY IN EACH

01:33:45.152 --> 01:33:47.521
COUNTY. AT ANY GIVEN TIME, DSH

01:33:47.588 --> 01:33:49.290
MAY HAVE AROUND 20 PATIENTS IN

01:33:49.357 --> 01:33:51.392
THE PROGRAM, WITH VERY FEW

01:33:51.459 --> 01:33:52.660
COUNTIES HAVING MORE THAN ONE

01:33:52.727 --> 01:33:54.495
SVP PATIENT RELEASED TO CONREP

01:33:54.562 --> 01:33:57.131
IN THE COUNTY. AT THE SAME TIME,

01:33:57.198 --> 01:33:58.766
IF INDIVIDUALS COULD BE PLACED

01:33:58.833 --> 01:34:01.202
IN TRANSITIONAL FACILITIES IN

01:34:01.268 --> 01:34:02.970
ALTERNATE COUNTIES, ANY COUNTY

01:34:03.037 --> 01:34:04.105
IDENTIFIED FOR POTENTIAL

01:34:04.171 --> 01:34:05.773
PLACEMENT OF THESE TYPES OF

01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:06.907
FACILITIES WOULD LIKELY RESPOND

01:34:06.974 --> 01:34:08.476
WITH SIGNIFICANT PROTEST AGAINST

01:34:08.542 --> 01:34:10.311
THE PLACEMENT OF THE FACILITY

01:34:10.378 --> 01:34:12.013
INTO THEIR COUNTY AND AGAINST

01:34:12.079 --> 01:34:14.081
HOUSING. INDIVIDUALS DESIGNATED

01:34:14.148 --> 01:34:17.218
AS AN SVP FROM OTHER COUNTIES.

01:34:17.284 --> 01:34:18.819
LASTLY, ABSENT SIGNIFICANT

01:34:18.886 --> 01:34:20.888
STATUTORY CHANGES, DEVELOPING

01:34:20.955 --> 01:34:22.356
TRANSITIONAL FACILITIES WOULD

01:34:22.423 --> 01:34:24.859
ALSO NOT RESOLVE THE PROBLEM OF

01:34:24.925 --> 01:34:26.694
INDIVIDUALS ULTIMATELY BEING

01:34:26.761 --> 01:34:28.195
REQUIRED TO BE PLACED INTO THE

01:34:28.262 --> 01:34:29.897
COMMUNITY AFTER TREATMENT IN A

01:34:29.964 --> 01:34:32.233
TRANSITIONAL FACILITY. AS SUCH,

01:34:32.299 --> 01:34:33.267
DEVELOPING THE TRANSITIONAL

01:34:33.334 --> 01:34:34.702
HOUSING WOULD SERVE TO ADD

01:34:34.769 --> 01:34:36.303
SIGNIFICANT INCREASED COSTS TO

01:34:36.370 --> 01:34:38.272
THE GENERAL FUND. WITHOUT A

01:34:38.339 --> 01:34:39.673
SIGNIFICANT RESOLUTION TO THE

01:34:39.740 --> 01:34:41.275
CURRENT CHALLENGES OF ULTIMATELY

01:34:41.342 --> 01:34:42.910
PLACING INDIVIDUALS IN THE

01:34:42.977 --> 01:34:44.745
COMMUNITY. THANK YOU FOR THE

01:34:44.812 --> 01:34:46.080
OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE SOME

01:34:46.147 --> 01:34:47.515
INFORMATION ABOUT OUR PROGRAM,

01:34:47.581 --> 01:34:49.250
AND TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A BRIEF

01:34:49.316 --> 01:34:50.451
UPDATE ON THE DEPARTMENT'S

01:34:50.518 --> 01:34:51.619
RESPONSE TO THE AUDIT

SITES PRIOR TO A LEASE BEING

01:35:59.286 --> 01:36:02.490
SIGNED? YEAH. SO THE DEPARTMENT

01:36:02.556 --> 01:36:04.692

WITH RESPECT TO WHEN A SITE

01:36:36.357 --> 01:36:37.725
ASSESSMENT IS PERFORMED. SO

01:36:37.791 --> 01:36:39.660
LET'S SAY THAT WE ARE ORDERED TO

01:36:39.727 --> 01:36:42.129

BE APPROVED BY THE DIRECTOR'S

01:40:19.513 --> 01:40:20.347

01:40:20.414 --> 01:40:21.982
POLICIES ARE THAT THE DIRECTOR'S

THEY SUBMIT IT TO THE HOUSING

01:40:24.718 --> 01:40:26.086
COMMITTEE FOR ITS CONSIDERATION

01:40:26.153 --> 01:40:27.921
AND TO THE COURT. OKAY. WE HEARD

01:40:27.988 --> 01:40:30.023
FROM THE AUDITOR THAT THE

01:40:30.090 --> 01:40:31.492
DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS IS

01:40:31.558 --> 01:40:32.960
CURRENTLY SPENDING ABOUT $2,800

01:40:33.026 --> 01:40:35.763
A MONTH ON CONTRACT TO LIBERTY

01:40:35.829 --> 01:40:37.531
TO FIND THE PLACEMENTS. IN

01:40:37.598 --> 01:40:38.699
ADDITION TO THAT EXPENSE,

01:40:38.766 --> 01:40:40.367
THERE'S ALSO EXPENSE FOR WHEN

01:40:40.434 --> 01:40:43.237
LIBERTY SIGNS A LEASE AND THEN

01:40:43.303 --> 01:40:46.507
IS DEEMED UNSUITABLE BY A JUDGE

01:40:46.573 --> 01:40:49.410
OR FOR OTHER REASONS. WHAT'S

01:40:49.476 --> 01:40:51.645
BEING DONE BY STATE HOSPITALS TO

01:40:51.712 --> 01:40:55.315
HOLD THOSE COSTS ACCOUNTABLE,

01:40:55.382 --> 01:40:57.785
ESPECIALLY BASICALLY, I THINK

01:40:57.851 --> 01:41:00.421
THE PERCEPTION IS LIBERTY HAS A

01:41:00.487 --> 01:41:03.090
BLANK CHECK HERE TO GO SPEND AS

01:41:03.157 --> 01:41:04.758
MUCH TIME AS THEY NEED TO SPEND

01:41:04.825 --> 01:41:06.894
TO FIND THESE PLACEMENTS. AND

01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:08.028
THEN ONCE THE PLACEMENTS IS THE

01:41:08.095 --> 01:41:09.630
LEASE IS SIGNED, THERE'S STILL

01:41:09.696 --> 01:41:12.900
NO ACCOUNTABILITY ON THAT LEASE

01:41:12.966 --> 01:41:15.702
PAYMENT. THAT COULD BE 4 TO 6 OR

01:41:15.769 --> 01:41:17.404
MORE THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH.

01:41:17.471 --> 01:41:18.539
SO WHAT'S BEING DONE BY STATE

01:41:18.605 --> 01:41:19.773
HOSPITALS TO HOLD LIBERTY

01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:21.074
ACCOUNTABLE ON THOSE ISSUES?

01:41:21.141 --> 01:41:22.309
YEAH. THANK YOU. AND I THINK

01:41:22.376 --> 01:41:23.277
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT

01:41:23.343 --> 01:41:25.646
THERE'S KIND OF LIKE A TWO PARTS

01:41:25.712 --> 01:41:27.281
TO THIS PROCESS. THERE'S A

01:41:27.347 --> 01:41:28.649
HOUSING HOLD AND THEN THERE'S

01:41:28.715 --> 01:41:30.684
THE FORMAL LEASE WHEN THE HOUSE

01:41:30.751 --> 01:41:32.786
IS APPROVED. SO INITIALLY WE

01:41:32.853 --> 01:41:37.424
WILL THE LIBERTY HEALTH CARE,

01:41:37.491 --> 01:41:38.625
OFTEN WITH APPROVAL FROM THE

01:41:38.692 --> 01:41:41.028
COURT WILL PUT IN A PUT A

01:41:41.094 --> 01:41:43.330
HOUSING HOLD ON THE PROPERTY AND

01:41:43.397 --> 01:41:45.466
ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE

01:41:45.532 --> 01:41:47.534
WITH THE OWNER IN ORDER TO START

01:41:47.601 --> 01:41:50.003
THAT EVALUATION PROCESS SO THAT

01:41:50.070 --> 01:41:52.306
THE OWNER CANNOT RENT THE

01:41:52.372 --> 01:41:54.074
PROPERTY UNTIL WE'VE DONE OUR

01:41:54.141 --> 01:41:58.479
VETTING AND, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE

01:41:58.545 --> 01:42:00.614
BASICALLY WE HAVE A HOLD ON THAT

01:42:00.681 --> 01:42:02.316
PROPERTY SO THAT WE CAN GO

01:42:02.382 --> 01:42:03.584
THROUGH IN OUR PROCESS WITH

01:42:03.650 --> 01:42:05.252
LIBERTY TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THE

01:42:05.319 --> 01:42:06.653
VETTING IN ORDER TO GO THROUGH

01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:08.522
ALL OF THE PROCESS THAT THAT

01:42:08.589 --> 01:42:10.190
HAPPENS. RIGHT. WE HAVE THE

01:42:10.257 --> 01:42:11.658
PROCESS IS REALLY LAID OUT IN

01:42:11.725 --> 01:42:13.427
STATUTE, AND WE HAVE TO FOLLOW

01:42:13.494 --> 01:42:14.695
THAT ENTIRE PROCESS, WHICH IS

01:42:14.761 --> 01:42:16.263
GOING THROUGH THE EVALUATIONS,

01:42:16.330 --> 01:42:18.999
THE SITE ASSESSMENTS. WE HAVE TO

01:42:19.066 --> 01:42:20.267
GO TO THE HOUSING COMMITTEE, WE

01:42:20.334 --> 01:42:23.003
HAVE TO GO TO THE COURT. THERE'S

01:42:23.070 --> 01:42:23.871
A 30 DAY NOTIFICATION PERIOD.

01:42:23.937 --> 01:42:25.405
ONCE WE'VE NOTICED THE COURT

01:42:25.472 --> 01:42:27.140
THAT WE HAVE TO DO WITH THE

01:42:27.207 --> 01:42:28.909
COMMUNITY, OFTENTIMES THERE ARE

01:42:28.976 --> 01:42:30.177
THINGS THAT HAPPEN WITH THE

01:42:30.244 --> 01:42:31.378
COURT THAT WILL, YOU KNOW,

01:42:31.445 --> 01:42:34.381
GENERATE CONTINUANCES SO THAT

01:42:34.448 --> 01:42:37.718
THAT HOME CAN BE IN ON HOLD FOR

01:42:37.784 --> 01:42:39.419
A PERIOD OF TIME WHILE WE ARE

01:42:39.486 --> 01:42:41.922
WORKING TO DO THROUGH THE ENTIRE

01:42:41.989 --> 01:42:44.825
STATUTORY PROCESS. AND THEN THEN

01:42:44.892 --> 01:42:46.460
ONCE THE COURT IS APPROVED, THEN

01:42:46.527 --> 01:42:49.062
THE LEASE GETS EXECUTED AND THEN

01:42:49.129 --> 01:42:51.331
AND THEN THE, YOU KNOW, THEN WE

01:42:51.398 --> 01:42:53.166
HAVE 30 DAYS TO MOVE THE

01:42:53.233 --> 01:42:54.134
INDIVIDUAL INTO THE COMMUNITY.

01:42:54.201 --> 01:42:56.670
IF THE COURT APPROVES THE, THE

01:42:56.737 --> 01:42:58.071
HOUSING. SO DO YOU HAVE SOME

01:42:58.138 --> 01:43:00.607
THOUGHTS ON IS THERE A WAY TO

01:43:00.674 --> 01:43:01.808
INCREASE THE ACCOUNTABILITY ON

01:43:01.875 --> 01:43:02.809
THOSE EXPENSES, OR ARE YOU

01:43:02.876 --> 01:43:04.811
COMFORTABLE WITH THE WAY THIS IS

01:43:04.878 --> 01:43:06.713
BEING HANDLED NOW? YEAH, WE ARE.

01:43:06.780 --> 01:43:08.148
LIKE I SAID, WE'RE HEAVILY

01:43:08.215 --> 01:43:09.750
INVOLVED IN WORKING VERY CLOSELY

01:43:09.816 --> 01:43:11.084
WITH LIBERTY THROUGHOUT THIS

01:43:11.151 --> 01:43:13.654
PROCESS. SO THEY AREN'T OFF ON

01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:15.055
THEIR OWN DOING IT WITHOUT

01:43:15.122 --> 01:43:16.590
OVERSIGHT. WE ARE WE ARE

01:43:16.657 --> 01:43:17.925
ACTIVELY ENGAGED AS THEY MOVE

01:43:17.991 --> 01:43:19.826
THROUGH STEP BY STEP THROUGH THE

01:43:19.893 --> 01:43:21.929
PROCESS. OKAY. I'LL SEGUE OVER

01:43:21.995 --> 01:43:23.363
TO I'VE GOT A COUPLE I HAD SOME

01:43:23.430 --> 01:43:24.831
QUESTIONS ABOUT TRANSIENT

01:43:24.898 --> 01:43:26.166
RELEASE AND ALL OF THAT, BUT I

01:43:26.233 --> 01:43:28.035
KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT RELEVANT

01:43:28.101 --> 01:43:28.802
REALLY TO THE CONVERSATION TODAY

01:43:28.869 --> 01:43:33.707
IN THE AUDIT. THE FOR LIBERTY

01:43:33.774 --> 01:43:36.276
HEALTHCARE. YOU KNOW, AS HAS

01:43:36.343 --> 01:43:37.511
BEEN STATED, THE AUDIT SHOWS

01:43:37.578 --> 01:43:40.080
THAT THERE'S, YOU KNOW, ABOUT A

01:43:40.147 --> 01:43:42.149
36% OF CONDITIONALLY RELEASED

01:43:42.215 --> 01:43:43.517
SPOUSE EITHER RE-OFFEND OR

01:43:43.584 --> 01:43:45.719
RETURNED TO STATE HOSPITALS AT

01:43:45.786 --> 01:43:47.921
36% FAILURE RATE, THAT OF COSTS

01:43:47.988 --> 01:43:50.457
THAT KEEP RISING. WHY SHOULD WHY

01:43:50.524 --> 01:43:52.593
SHOULD TAXPAYERS TRUST LIBERTY

01:43:52.659 --> 01:43:53.994
HEALTHCARE TO ADMINISTER THIS

01:43:54.061 --> 01:43:55.395
PROGRAM IN A WAY THAT PROTECTS

01:43:55.462 --> 01:43:57.931
PUBLIC SAFETY AND RESPONSIBLY

01:43:57.998 --> 01:44:00.200
UTILIZES TAXPAYER MONEY? THANK

01:44:00.267 --> 01:44:02.269
YOU. SENATOR. YOU KNOW, THE

01:44:02.336 --> 01:44:03.670
CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAM

01:44:03.737 --> 01:44:05.472
MODEL? ACTUALLY, CALIFORNIA

01:44:05.539 --> 01:44:06.974
PIONEERED ITS CURRENT VERSION OF

01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:08.609
IT IN THE 80S, AND IT'S REALLY

01:44:08.675 --> 01:44:10.510
BEEN A STAR AMONGST THE WHOLE

01:44:10.577 --> 01:44:12.346
COUNTRY IN TERMS OF ITS OUTCOMES

01:44:12.412 --> 01:44:14.781
AND APPROACH. OF COURSE, LATER,

01:44:14.848 --> 01:44:17.117
AN ADAPTATION OF AN SVP CONCEPT

01:44:17.184 --> 01:44:18.852
CAME INTO PLAY, BUT THE SAME

01:44:18.919 --> 01:44:20.988
PRINCIPLES ARE INVOLVED. IT'S

01:44:21.054 --> 01:44:22.823
BEEN EXTENSIVELY STUDIED,

01:44:22.889 --> 01:44:23.757
ACTUALLY, BY THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:44:23.824 --> 01:44:24.891
MENTAL HEALTH AS THEY

01:44:24.958 --> 01:44:27.194
IMPLEMENTED THIS MODEL. AND IN

01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:29.196
FACT, THEY DID FIND IF YOU

01:44:29.262 --> 01:44:31.064
CONDITIONALLY RELEASE SOMEONE,

01:44:31.131 --> 01:44:34.468
YOU HAVE MORE FAILURES TO TERMS

01:44:34.534 --> 01:44:36.803
AND CONDITIONS OF RELEASE, THEN

01:44:36.870 --> 01:44:38.872
YOU DO ACTUAL RE OFFENSES. AND

01:44:38.939 --> 01:44:40.474
SO UP UNTIL THIS POINT, THAT'S

01:44:40.540 --> 01:44:42.576
BEEN VIEWED AS A POSITIVE OF

01:44:42.643 --> 01:44:43.644
CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAM. IN

01:44:43.710 --> 01:44:45.045
OTHER WORDS, THOSE TWO THINGS

01:44:45.112 --> 01:44:46.546
AREN'T LUMPED INTO ONE CATEGORY

01:44:46.613 --> 01:44:49.349
OF FAILURE. IN FACT, WE PREFER

01:44:49.416 --> 01:44:51.485
HAVING A FAILURE BECAUSE SOMEONE

01:44:51.551 --> 01:44:53.253
FAILED A TERM AND CONDITION

01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:55.522
RATHER THAN PROGRESSED ON PAST

01:44:55.589 --> 01:44:58.125
THAT FAILURE TO A POINT OF

01:44:58.191 --> 01:44:59.459
RE-OFFENSE. SO IF YOU DO HAVE A

01:44:59.526 --> 01:45:00.861
CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAM, YOU

01:45:00.927 --> 01:45:03.430
WILL HAVE MORE FAILURES DUE TO

01:45:03.497 --> 01:45:05.699
TERMS AND CONDITIONS. THAT'S A

01:45:05.766 --> 01:45:09.136
TRADE, HOWEVER, TO LESS ACTUAL

01:45:09.202 --> 01:45:11.004
CRIMES BEING COMMITTED. SO UP

01:45:11.071 --> 01:45:11.738
UNTIL THIS POINT, THAT'S BEEN

01:45:11.805 --> 01:45:13.974
VIEWED AS A POSITIVE. AND IN

01:45:14.041 --> 01:45:15.375
FACT, THE OUTCOME THAT YOU GET

01:45:15.442 --> 01:45:16.843
FROM A CONDITIONAL RELEASE

01:45:16.910 --> 01:45:17.778
PROGRAM, THAT'S WHY YOU

01:45:17.844 --> 01:45:19.212
IMPLEMENT A CONDITIONAL RELEASE

01:45:19.279 --> 01:45:21.014
PROGRAM SO THAT YOU CATCH

01:45:21.081 --> 01:45:23.550
EARLIER IN THE PROCESS OF

01:45:23.617 --> 01:45:26.053
DECLINING, AND YOU'RE

01:45:26.119 --> 01:45:27.387
INSTITUTIONALIZE THAT PERSON WHO

01:45:27.454 --> 01:45:29.523
IS NOW ON TRACK TOWARD A

01:45:29.589 --> 01:45:30.390
RE-OFFENSE. SO THAT'S WHAT I

01:45:30.457 --> 01:45:32.292
GUESS I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU

01:45:32.359 --> 01:45:34.428
MAY BE GETTING A GAIN FROM THAT.

01:45:34.494 --> 01:45:35.762
WELL, I THINK, YOU KNOW, ONE OF

01:45:35.829 --> 01:45:37.531
THE ARGUMENTS THAT THAT WE'RE

01:45:37.597 --> 01:45:39.399
TRYING TO GET TO HERE IS THAT

01:45:39.466 --> 01:45:41.902
THIS PROGRAM IS SAFE, AND I'M

01:45:41.968 --> 01:45:42.502
TRYING TO ARGUE THAT IT'S NOT

01:45:42.569 --> 01:45:44.104
LIBERTY HEALTH CARE. YOU PLACED

01:45:44.171 --> 01:45:45.472
DOUGLAS BADGER, A SERIAL

01:45:45.539 --> 01:45:47.407
PREDATOR NEXT TO A FAMILY WITH

01:45:47.474 --> 01:45:49.943
CHILDREN, TWO OF THEM DEAF.

01:45:50.010 --> 01:45:51.178
DEAF. AND I'M JUST WONDERING,

01:45:51.244 --> 01:45:54.014
HOW CAN WE CONSIDER THAT SAFE?

01:45:54.081 --> 01:45:54.915
HOW IS THAT A RESPONSIBLE

01:45:54.981 --> 01:45:57.851
PLACEMENT? WELL, I'M SORRY, I

01:45:57.918 --> 01:45:59.553
CAN'T SPEAK EXACTLY TO THAT

01:45:59.619 --> 01:46:01.354
EXACT PLACEMENT PROCESS. I WOULD

01:46:01.421 --> 01:46:03.056
RETURN TO THE PROCESSES THAT WE

01:46:03.123 --> 01:46:04.357
HAVE IN PLACE FOR DETERMINING

01:46:04.424 --> 01:46:06.126
WHERE THIS HOUSING IS. THIS IS

01:46:06.193 --> 01:46:07.928
OBVIOUSLY A VERY UPSETTING

01:46:07.994 --> 01:46:10.464
PROCESS, RIGHT, TO TAKE SOMEONE

01:46:10.530 --> 01:46:11.965
ENTITLED A SEXUALLY VIOLENT

01:46:12.032 --> 01:46:13.266
PREDATOR AND RETURN THEM TO THE

01:46:13.333 --> 01:46:15.068
COMMUNITY. AND THERE ARE

01:46:15.135 --> 01:46:18.038
PASSIONS AND EMOTIONS AND, AND

01:46:18.105 --> 01:46:19.606
THAT HAVE TO BE GONE THROUGH. SO

01:46:19.673 --> 01:46:22.642
WE'VE IMPLEMENTED A PROCESS OF

01:46:22.709 --> 01:46:23.310
DETERMINING WHERE THAT WOULD BE.

01:46:23.376 --> 01:46:25.145
BY THE WAY, WE DO THIS BECAUSE

01:46:25.212 --> 01:46:27.314
WE'RE ASKED TO SEARCH FOR THIS,

01:46:27.380 --> 01:46:29.483
FOR THESE HOUSING, JUST BECAUSE

01:46:29.549 --> 01:46:31.551
SOMEONE HAS TO LOOK FOR IT. SO

01:46:31.618 --> 01:46:34.154
WE HAVE DESIGNATED, YOU KNOW,

01:46:34.221 --> 01:46:35.856
PEOPLE THAT GO OUT AND SEARCH

01:46:35.922 --> 01:46:37.958
FOR IT, BY THE WAY, TO LET YOU

01:46:38.024 --> 01:46:39.626
KNOW, WE PROVIDE TREATMENT, WE

01:46:39.693 --> 01:46:40.961
PROVIDE SUPERVISION. THOSE WE

01:46:41.027 --> 01:46:43.263
USE ON OUR SUPERVISION END OF

01:46:43.330 --> 01:46:44.831
THINGS. WE HIRE PEOPLE WITH

01:46:44.898 --> 01:46:46.733
PROBATION EXPERIENCE, PAROLE

01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:47.968
EXPERIENCE, LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:46:48.034 --> 01:46:49.002
EXPERIENCE, BECAUSE THAT'S THE

01:46:49.069 --> 01:46:50.737
EXPERTISE YOU NEED IN KIND OF

01:46:50.804 --> 01:46:52.305
CONSIDERING THESE LOCATIONS. I

01:46:52.372 --> 01:46:53.573
JUST POINT BACK TO THE PROCESS

01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:54.941
I'M POINTING THAT ONE TO

01:46:55.008 --> 01:46:56.543
SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE I'M SURE

01:46:56.610 --> 01:46:57.477
ASSEMBLYMEMBER DEMAIO AND I

01:46:57.544 --> 01:46:59.780
WOULD AGREE THAT BORREGO SPRINGS

01:46:59.846 --> 01:47:02.449
IS NOT A IS A PARTICULARLY SAFE

01:47:02.516 --> 01:47:04.985
PLACE TO RELEASE SEXUALLY

01:47:05.051 --> 01:47:07.320
VIOLENT PREDATORS, FOR THE SAME

01:47:07.387 --> 01:47:09.456
REASONS THAT SENATOR VALLADARES

01:47:09.523 --> 01:47:11.191
MENTIONED HER AREA HAS BEEN

01:47:11.258 --> 01:47:12.993
STATED ON THE DAIS, AND WE'RE

01:47:13.059 --> 01:47:15.929
HEARING FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS

01:47:15.996 --> 01:47:18.131
THAT LIBERTY HEALTH CARE IS

01:47:18.198 --> 01:47:21.268
LYING TO OUR CONSTITUENTS.

01:47:21.334 --> 01:47:23.570
THEY'RE LYING TO THE HOMEOWNERS,

01:47:23.637 --> 01:47:24.905
THEY'RE LYING TO THE

01:47:24.971 --> 01:47:26.273
COMMUNITIES. THEY'RE MISLEADING

01:47:26.339 --> 01:47:28.608
TO SECURE THESE PLACEMENTS. WHY

01:47:28.675 --> 01:47:31.278
ARE WE TOLERATING THIS? AND WHAT

01:47:31.344 --> 01:47:33.280
ARE YOU DOING TO CORRECT IT OR

01:47:33.346 --> 01:47:35.282
PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING

01:47:35.348 --> 01:47:36.516
ANYMORE? SO I'M VERY CONCERNED

01:47:36.583 --> 01:47:37.684
ABOUT ALLEGATIONS AGAINST

01:47:37.751 --> 01:47:40.086
LIBERTY HEALTH CARE. I, I WANT

01:47:40.153 --> 01:47:41.988
TO HEAR ABOUT THEM. I WANT TO

01:47:42.055 --> 01:47:44.057
KNOW ANY ALLEGATION AGAINST THIS

01:47:44.124 --> 01:47:45.792
PROGRAM THAT THERE'S BEEN A

01:47:45.859 --> 01:47:47.861
MISDEED. WE WILL LOOK AT THAT.

01:47:47.928 --> 01:47:50.197
WE WILL UNCOVER THAT IF WE MAKE

01:47:50.263 --> 01:47:52.299
MISTAKES, WE WILL BE ACCOUNTABLE

01:47:52.365 --> 01:47:55.502
FOR THAT. SO I WELCOME HEARING

01:47:55.569 --> 01:47:57.304
ABOUT THINGS THAT WE NEED TO

01:47:57.370 --> 01:47:58.572
LOOK INTO. AND LIBERTY

01:47:58.638 --> 01:47:59.873
HEALTHCARE WILL BE TRANSPARENT

01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:01.975
AND PARTICIPATE IN ALL SEARCHES.

01:48:02.042 --> 01:48:05.278
SO WHAT WE BRING, WE WILL BE

01:48:05.345 --> 01:48:07.347
TRANSPARENT IN WHAT OUR

01:48:07.414 --> 01:48:09.649
PROCESSES ARE. IN TERMS OF THIS.

01:48:09.716 --> 01:48:11.518
WELL, I WANT TO BRING UP ONE

01:48:11.585 --> 01:48:13.553
SPECIFIC EXAMPLE. SVP GARY

01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:15.522
SNAVELY. YOU TOLD THE HOMEOWNER

01:48:15.589 --> 01:48:17.424
IT WAS EITHER A WITNESS

01:48:17.490 --> 01:48:18.959
PROTECTION OR A VIOLENT

01:48:19.025 --> 01:48:20.760
CRIMINAL, AND THAT HE WAS IN HIS

01:48:20.827 --> 01:48:22.863
70S WHEN HE WAS ACTUALLY 61. YOU

01:48:22.929 --> 01:48:25.532
ALSO OFFERED $6,000 A MONTH WHEN

01:48:25.599 --> 01:48:26.900
THE MARKET RATE WAS $4,000 A

01:48:26.967 --> 01:48:32.138
MONTH. THIS SEEMS LIKE

01:48:32.205 --> 01:48:37.677
DELIBERATE DECEPTION. IN IN

01:48:37.744 --> 01:48:39.312
FINDING A LANDLORD, WE GO OUT,

01:48:39.379 --> 01:48:41.948
WE SEARCH FOR AVAILABLE HOUSING.

01:48:42.015 --> 01:48:44.251
WE HAVE AN ENTIRE PROCESS OF

01:48:44.317 --> 01:48:46.987
INFORMING THAT LANDLORD THAT

01:48:47.053 --> 01:48:48.154
LISTEN, WE'RE LOOKING FOR A

01:48:48.221 --> 01:48:49.923
HOUSE. THIS PERSON HAS COMMITTED

01:48:49.990 --> 01:48:51.458
SOME OFFENSES. OKAY? I'M OKAY

01:48:51.524 --> 01:48:52.492
WITH THAT. THIS PERSON'S

01:48:52.559 --> 01:48:53.860
COMMITTED SOME SEX OFFENSES.

01:48:53.927 --> 01:48:55.562
OKAY, OKAY. THIS PERSON IS A

01:48:55.629 --> 01:48:57.063
SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR.

01:48:57.130 --> 01:48:58.164
SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR.

01:48:58.231 --> 01:49:00.634
PLACES CAN BECOME VERY

01:49:00.700 --> 01:49:02.469
LITIGIOUS. VERY A LOT OF

01:49:02.535 --> 01:49:04.604
COMMUNITY OPPOSITION. WE

01:49:04.671 --> 01:49:06.840
INTRODUCE THAT TO THE LANDLORDS.

01:49:06.907 --> 01:49:09.643
THEY UNDERSTAND THAT BEFORE

01:49:09.709 --> 01:49:12.212
MOVING FORWARD, WE OFTEN IN FACT

01:49:12.279 --> 01:49:14.014
MAYBE ALWAYS PAY OVER MARKET

01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:15.181
RATE, BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY

01:49:15.248 --> 01:49:16.917
REASON THAT LANDLORDS ARE

01:49:16.983 --> 01:49:19.519
WILLING TO DO THIS. AND

01:49:19.586 --> 01:49:21.621
SOMETIMES THE OPPOSITION IS MORE

01:49:21.688 --> 01:49:22.822
OVERWHELMING THAN THEY THOUGHT

01:49:22.889 --> 01:49:24.891
IT WAS. AND THAT OPPOSITION CAN

01:49:24.958 --> 01:49:26.726
COME FROM FAMILY MEMBERS. IT CAN

01:49:26.793 --> 01:49:28.461
COME AGAINST ANY OTHER BUSINESS

01:49:28.528 --> 01:49:30.196
INTERESTS THAT THEY HAVE. IT CAN

01:49:30.263 --> 01:49:33.033
COME FROM ALL SORTS OF LEVELS

01:49:33.099 --> 01:49:35.335
THAT THEY JUST DID NOT

01:49:35.402 --> 01:49:36.703
ANTICIPATE WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.

01:49:36.770 --> 01:49:39.239
SO WE DO INFORM THE LANDLORDS,

01:49:39.306 --> 01:49:40.974
BUT THEY SOMETIMES DON'T FEEL

01:49:41.041 --> 01:49:42.409
INFORMED BECAUSE LATER ON IT'S

01:49:42.475 --> 01:49:45.712
JUST NOT IT'S FAR BEYOND WHAT

01:49:45.779 --> 01:49:47.180
THEY EVEN THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

01:49:47.247 --> 01:49:48.615
HEY MR. CHAIR, I'LL WRAP UP.

01:49:48.682 --> 01:49:49.783
I'VE GOT SOME MORE QUESTIONS,

01:49:49.849 --> 01:49:52.385
BUT THE YOU KNOW, THE BOTTOM

01:49:52.452 --> 01:49:54.421
LINE IS, AND AS HAS BEEN SHARED

01:49:54.487 --> 01:49:57.590
HERE, THIS PROGRAM NEEDS SOME

01:49:57.657 --> 01:50:00.794
SOME MAJOR OVERHAULS. AND, YOU

01:50:00.860 --> 01:50:02.295
KNOW, THAT'S WHY I'M CARRYING

01:50:02.362 --> 01:50:03.997
LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS TWO

01:50:04.064 --> 01:50:05.832
POINTS OF THE AUDIT. I THINK

01:50:05.899 --> 01:50:07.667
THINGS THAT WE CAN FIX AND SO

01:50:07.734 --> 01:50:09.469
FAR HAVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT ON.

01:50:09.536 --> 01:50:10.570
AND I'LL CONTINUE WORKING ON

01:50:10.637 --> 01:50:13.139
THESE ISSUES UNTIL MY LAST DAY

01:50:13.206 --> 01:50:14.941
HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE. THANK

01:50:15.008 --> 01:50:17.477
YOU. THANK YOU, SENATOR JONES.

01:50:17.544 --> 01:50:19.112
NEXT IS SENATOR VALLADARES AND

01:50:19.179 --> 01:50:20.914
THEN ASSEMBLYMEMBER DEMAIO.

01:50:20.981 --> 01:50:22.215
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR. SO I HAVE

01:50:22.282 --> 01:50:25.251
A FEW QUESTIONS, BOTH FOR DSH

01:50:25.318 --> 01:50:30.090
AND ALSO LIBERTY. SO TO D.H.

01:50:30.156 --> 01:50:34.627
DSH, DO YOU TRACK ANY REGIONAL

01:50:34.694 --> 01:50:37.864
TRENDS ON SVP PLACEMENT WITH

01:50:37.931 --> 01:50:40.033
RESPECT TO LIKE THE NUMBER OF

01:50:40.100 --> 01:50:40.633
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE PLACED IN

01:50:40.700 --> 01:50:42.936
THE COMMUNITY AND IN THE AREAS?

01:50:43.003 --> 01:50:44.771
YES. AND ANY, ANY TRACKING AND

01:50:44.838 --> 01:50:46.306
DATA YOU MIGHT HAVE ON THE PLATE

01:50:46.373 --> 01:50:48.208
AND THE PERCENTAGE OF PLACEMENT

01:50:48.274 --> 01:50:51.678
IN RURAL AREAS. SO I DO WANT TO

01:50:51.745 --> 01:50:53.013
KIND OF TALK ABOUT THE RURAL

01:50:53.079 --> 01:50:54.447
PLACEMENT, BECAUSE I RECOGNIZE

01:50:54.514 --> 01:50:57.350
THAT IS A CONCERN. AND, AND IN

01:50:57.417 --> 01:50:59.285
IN MANY CASES, INDIVIDUALS ARE

01:50:59.352 --> 01:51:01.921
PLACED IN RURAL AREAS. I CAN

01:51:01.988 --> 01:51:03.590
ASSURE YOU THAT IT'S NOT THAT

01:51:03.656 --> 01:51:05.325
THE DEPARTMENT IS TARGETING

01:51:05.392 --> 01:51:07.894
RURAL AREAS, NOR IS LIBERTY

01:51:07.961 --> 01:51:08.828
HEALTHCARE. AS I MENTIONED

01:51:08.895 --> 01:51:11.731
BEFORE, WE ARE SEARCHING THE

01:51:11.798 --> 01:51:13.700
ENTIRE COUNTY THAT. SO IT REALLY

01:51:13.767 --> 01:51:16.736
IS A PROCESS OF WHAT THE STATUTE

01:51:16.803 --> 01:51:19.339
LAYS OUT. SO ULTIMATELY THE

01:51:19.406 --> 01:51:21.041
INDIVIDUAL HAS TO BE PLACED IN

01:51:21.107 --> 01:51:22.208
THE COUNTY OF DOMICILE, AND

01:51:22.275 --> 01:51:23.910
THAT'S OFTEN WITHIN THE COUNTY

01:51:23.977 --> 01:51:27.580
OF COMMITMENT. AND THEN THE

01:51:27.647 --> 01:51:29.749
STATUTE REQUIRES THAT FOR

01:51:29.816 --> 01:51:30.950
CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS WITH CERTAIN

01:51:31.017 --> 01:51:32.285
TYPES OF OFFENSES, WE CANNOT

01:51:32.352 --> 01:51:33.920
PLACE THEM WITHIN A QUARTER MILE

01:51:33.987 --> 01:51:36.156
OF A PUBLIC OR PRIVATE SCHOOL

01:51:36.222 --> 01:51:39.159
AND THAT PUBLIC OR SO THAT OFTEN

01:51:39.225 --> 01:51:40.727
RIGHT THERE WITHIN THE QUARTER

01:51:40.794 --> 01:51:42.228
MILE OF A PUBLIC OR PRIVATE

01:51:42.295 --> 01:51:46.399
SCHOOL. LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO

01:51:46.466 --> 01:51:49.102
PLACE IN DENSE URBAN AREAS AND

01:51:49.169 --> 01:51:53.506
OFTEN GENERATES A, A LIMITS MUCH

01:51:53.573 --> 01:51:55.308
OF THE COUNTY, A GOOD PORTION OF

01:51:55.375 --> 01:51:57.310
THE COUNTY THAT WE WILL BE ABLE

01:51:57.377 --> 01:51:59.012
TO PLACE AN INDIVIDUAL INTO. AND

01:51:59.079 --> 01:52:01.748
THEN I AND THEN I WOULD ALSO

01:52:01.815 --> 01:52:07.153
NOTE THAT THE THAT. DEFINITION

01:52:07.220 --> 01:52:09.989
OF PUBLIC PRIVATE SCHOOL WAS

01:52:10.056 --> 01:52:11.524
RECENTLY INTERPRETED BY AN

01:52:11.591 --> 01:52:13.326
APPELLATE COURT TO ALSO INCLUDE

01:52:13.393 --> 01:52:15.462
HOMESCHOOL. SO WE'RE ALSO NOW

01:52:15.528 --> 01:52:17.931
HAVE TO SEARCH TO DETERMINE WITH

01:52:17.997 --> 01:52:19.332
THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

01:52:19.399 --> 01:52:20.767
WHETHER THERE IS A HOMESCHOOL IN

01:52:20.834 --> 01:52:22.969
THE AREA AS WELL. AND SO IT

01:52:23.036 --> 01:52:25.038
REALLY WHEN YOU START TO LAY OUT

01:52:25.105 --> 01:52:28.641
THE IF YOU TOOK THE MAP OF THE

01:52:28.708 --> 01:52:30.210
COUNTY AND YOU LAY OUT THE

01:52:30.276 --> 01:52:31.711
CENSUS TRACKS AND THE RURAL AND

01:52:31.778 --> 01:52:33.880
URBAN AREAS, AND THEN LAY OVER

01:52:33.947 --> 01:52:35.148
THE SCHOOLS AND THE QUARTER

01:52:35.215 --> 01:52:37.750
MILES AROUND THEM, ULTIMATELY WE

01:52:37.817 --> 01:52:39.953
FIND THAT THERE IS NOT MUCH OF A

01:52:40.019 --> 01:52:41.287
COUNTY THAT IS ACTUALLY

01:52:41.354 --> 01:52:42.856
ACCESSIBLE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO

01:52:42.922 --> 01:52:44.891
PLACE AN INDIVIDUAL INTO THE

01:52:44.958 --> 01:52:48.595
INTO THE COMMUNITY. SO IS THERE

01:52:48.661 --> 01:52:51.131
LESS COMMUNITY RESISTANCE OR

01:52:51.197 --> 01:52:53.900
POLITICAL POWER IN RURAL AREAS?

01:52:53.967 --> 01:52:56.102
ONE AND TWO. DO YOU FIND THAT

01:52:56.169 --> 01:53:00.306
THAT'S THE CASE? AND TWO, WHAT

01:53:00.373 --> 01:53:02.575
CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO LAW

01:53:02.642 --> 01:53:06.279
ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE TIMES? SO

01:53:06.346 --> 01:53:07.614
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR QUESTION

01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:09.082
ABOUT LESS COMMUNITY RESISTANCE,

01:53:09.149 --> 01:53:10.850
I WOULD SAY NO. I WOULD SAY THAT

01:53:10.917 --> 01:53:12.752
WE SEE VERY CONSISTENTLY ACROSS

01:53:12.819 --> 01:53:15.288
ALL THE PLACEMENTS, THE

01:53:15.355 --> 01:53:18.858
COMMUNITY RESISTANCE AND THE

01:53:18.925 --> 01:53:19.993
COMMUNITY FEEDBACK, AND THAT'S

01:53:20.059 --> 01:53:22.795
PART OF THE PROCESS. SO THE

01:53:22.862 --> 01:53:26.065
PROCESS IS LAID OUT IN STATUTE

01:53:26.132 --> 01:53:28.067
REQUIRES US TO NOTICE THE, THE

01:53:28.134 --> 01:53:29.802
SHERIFF. AND ONCE WE HAVE BACK

01:53:29.869 --> 01:53:31.771
UP, ONCE WE HAVE NOTIFIED THE

01:53:31.838 --> 01:53:33.606
COURT THAT WE HAVE A POTENTIAL

01:53:33.673 --> 01:53:36.509
PLACEMENT AND THE COURT IS GOING

01:53:36.576 --> 01:53:37.944
TO HEAR THAT POTENTIAL

01:53:38.011 --> 01:53:39.279
PLACEMENT, WE THEN HAVE TO

01:53:39.345 --> 01:53:40.547
NOTIFY THE SHERIFF AND THE

01:53:40.613 --> 01:53:43.616
DISTRICT ATTORNEY THAT OF THAT

01:53:43.683 --> 01:53:45.485
SPECIFIC LOCATION, AND THEN THE

01:53:45.552 --> 01:53:46.586
SHERIFF AND THE DISTRICT

01:53:46.653 --> 01:53:49.422
ATTORNEY THEN WILL GENERALLY,

01:53:49.489 --> 01:53:50.790
IT'S THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WILL

01:53:50.857 --> 01:53:52.592
NOTIFY THE PUBLIC OF THAT

01:53:52.659 --> 01:53:54.360
PLACEMENT LOCATION AND SOLICIT

01:53:54.427 --> 01:53:56.763
COMMUNITY FEEDBACK. AND ALL OF

01:53:56.829 --> 01:53:58.798
THAT FEEDBACK IS VERY IMPORTANT

01:53:58.865 --> 01:54:00.867
TO THE PROCESS, BECAUSE WE

01:54:00.934 --> 01:54:02.368
ACTUALLY RECEIVE ALL OF THAT

01:54:02.435 --> 01:54:03.436
FEEDBACK FROM THE DISTRICT

01:54:03.503 --> 01:54:05.004
ATTORNEY, AND OFTEN WE RECEIVE

01:54:05.071 --> 01:54:06.673
FEEDBACK DIRECTLY INTO OUR

01:54:06.739 --> 01:54:07.640
OFFICES AND DIRECTLY INTO

01:54:07.707 --> 01:54:09.909
LIBERTY HEALTH CARE. AND ALL OF

01:54:09.976 --> 01:54:11.778
THAT FEEDBACK IS NOT ONLY

01:54:11.844 --> 01:54:12.745
CONSIDERED BY THE DEPARTMENT,

01:54:12.812 --> 01:54:14.614
BUT IT'S ALSO CONSIDERED BY THE

01:54:14.681 --> 01:54:16.449
COURT IN REVIEWING THAT

01:54:16.516 --> 01:54:18.585
PLACEMENT. AND I CAN TELL YOU

01:54:18.651 --> 01:54:21.487
THERE HAS BEEN TIMES WHERE THE

01:54:21.554 --> 01:54:23.289
COMMUNITY FEEDBACK WAS EXTREMELY

01:54:23.356 --> 01:54:24.824
IMPORTANT, AND IT CAUSED US TO

01:54:24.891 --> 01:54:26.492
PULL A LOCATION BECAUSE THERE

01:54:26.559 --> 01:54:28.394
WAS ENOUGH INFORMATION THAT HAD

01:54:28.461 --> 01:54:29.696
US CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER WE

01:54:29.762 --> 01:54:30.797
COULD SAFELY TREAT THE

01:54:30.863 --> 01:54:33.600
INDIVIDUAL IN THAT COMMUNITY. SO

01:54:33.666 --> 01:54:35.868
BUT WE HAVE TO TAKE ALL OF THAT

01:54:35.935 --> 01:54:37.036
COMMUNITY FEEDBACK AND THEN

01:54:37.103 --> 01:54:38.638
PROVIDE A RESPONSE TO THE COURT.

01:54:38.705 --> 01:54:40.206
AND THEN SOMETIMES THAT

01:54:40.273 --> 01:54:42.875
COMMUNITY FEEDBACK MAY HAVE US

01:54:42.942 --> 01:54:44.644
CHANGE OUR DECISION ABOUT A

01:54:44.711 --> 01:54:46.079
PLACEMENT. SOMETIMES IT REQUIRES

01:54:46.145 --> 01:54:48.014
US TO AT LIBERTY TO UPDATE THE

01:54:48.081 --> 01:54:50.516
TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND MAKE A

01:54:50.583 --> 01:54:51.251
RECOMMENDATION FOR MORE

01:54:51.317 --> 01:54:52.785
STRINGENT TERMS OR DIFFERENT

01:54:52.852 --> 01:54:54.887
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR THE

01:54:54.954 --> 01:54:57.123
INDIVIDUAL. SO THE COMMUNITY'S

01:54:57.190 --> 01:54:58.691
FEEDBACK AND PROCESS IS VERY

01:54:58.758 --> 01:55:01.761
IMPORTANT. AND I'D SAY WE SEE IT

01:55:01.828 --> 01:55:03.162
CONSISTENTLY ACROSS THE

01:55:03.229 --> 01:55:04.397
COUNTIES. AND I HAVE ONE MORE

01:55:04.464 --> 01:55:06.432
QUESTION. AND THEN I'M GOING TO

01:55:06.499 --> 01:55:07.367
HAVE TWO QUESTIONS FOR LIBERTY

01:55:07.433 --> 01:55:10.003
HEALTHCARE. SO IN THE FINAL

01:55:10.069 --> 01:55:12.305
STEP, ONE OF THE FINAL STEPS OF

01:55:12.372 --> 01:55:13.306
PLACEMENT, YOU GO THROUGH YOUR

01:55:13.373 --> 01:55:17.543
PROCESS. YOU PRESENT THE ORDERED

01:55:17.610 --> 01:55:20.847
OR SUGGESTION TO THE COURTS. AND

01:55:20.913 --> 01:55:24.083
QUITE OFTEN JUDGES. IS IT TRUE

01:55:24.150 --> 01:55:25.652
THAT QUITE OFTEN JUDGES WILL

01:55:25.718 --> 01:55:27.353
MAKE THAT PLACEMENT OUTSIDE OF

01:55:27.420 --> 01:55:30.857
THEIR USUAL OUTSIDE OF THEIR OWN

01:55:30.923 --> 01:55:31.924
COMMUNITIES? BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE

01:55:31.991 --> 01:55:34.427
SEEING IS THAT IN THE CASE OF

01:55:34.494 --> 01:55:35.728
THE ANTELOPE VALLEY, THE

01:55:35.795 --> 01:55:36.963
PILLOWCASE RAPISTS, THERE'S A

01:55:37.030 --> 01:55:39.565
JUDGE FROM SANTA CLARA THAT'S

01:55:39.632 --> 01:55:40.933
MAKING DECISIONS FOR OUR

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:42.802
COMMUNITY AND THAT IMPACT OUR

01:55:42.869 --> 01:55:43.903
COMMUNITY. SO YOU'RE TALKING

01:55:43.970 --> 01:55:45.238
ABOUT THE OUT OF COUNTY

01:55:45.305 --> 01:55:47.073
PLACEMENTS INTO ANOTHER COUNTY.

01:55:47.140 --> 01:55:50.343
SO PRIOR TO SB 1034, THERE WAS

01:55:50.410 --> 01:55:52.211
THE STATUTE DID NOT HAVE A VERY

01:55:52.278 --> 01:55:54.080
CLEAR PROCESS FOR A COURT TO

01:55:54.147 --> 01:55:56.482
FOLLOW IN DETERMINING

01:55:56.549 --> 01:55:57.950
EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES. AND

01:55:58.017 --> 01:56:00.219
SO THE STATUTE LAYS OUT THAT,

01:56:00.286 --> 01:56:02.155
YOU KNOW, IF EXTRAORDINARY PRIOR

01:56:02.221 --> 01:56:04.390
TO SB 1034, IF A COURT HAD

01:56:04.457 --> 01:56:05.858
DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS

01:56:05.925 --> 01:56:07.260
EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES IN

01:56:07.327 --> 01:56:09.395
THE CASE, THEY COULD ORDER THE

01:56:09.462 --> 01:56:12.332
DEPARTMENT, WE IN LIBERTY DO NOT

01:56:12.398 --> 01:56:13.833
SEARCH FOR OUT OF COUNTY UNLESS

01:56:13.900 --> 01:56:15.234
WE'RE ORDERED TO. THAT IS NOT

01:56:15.301 --> 01:56:17.437
SOMETHING THAT EVEN PRIOR TO THE

01:56:17.503 --> 01:56:20.973
LAW CHANGE BY SB 1034, THAT WE

01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:23.142
EVER DID, WE ONLY IF WE WERE

01:56:23.209 --> 01:56:24.477
ORDERED TO LOOK IN ANOTHER

01:56:24.544 --> 01:56:27.880
COUNTY, SB 1034 CHANGED THE LAW

01:56:27.947 --> 01:56:31.050
AND THE PROCESS AND PROVIDED A

01:56:31.117 --> 01:56:32.852
THE SPECIFIC PROCESS THAT MUST

01:56:32.919 --> 01:56:35.655
BE FOLLOWED IN ORDER FOR A COURT

01:56:35.722 --> 01:56:37.457
TO CONSIDER EXTRAORDINARY

01:56:37.523 --> 01:56:38.858
CIRCUMSTANCES. AND NOW IT

01:56:38.925 --> 01:56:40.393
REQUIRES THAT THE DISTRICT

01:56:40.460 --> 01:56:42.528
ATTORNEY OF THE COUNTY OF

01:56:42.595 --> 01:56:44.597
COMMITMENT TO THE DOMICILE

01:56:44.664 --> 01:56:48.000
COUNTY TO FILE A PETITION FOR

01:56:48.067 --> 01:56:49.402
EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES

01:56:49.469 --> 01:56:50.770
PRIOR. SOMETIMES JUDGES WOULD

01:56:50.837 --> 01:56:53.940
FIND THAT WITHOUT A PETITION.

01:56:54.006 --> 01:56:56.943
BUT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY NOW

01:56:57.009 --> 01:56:58.745
HAS TO FILE. THERE IS SPECIFIC

01:56:58.811 --> 01:56:59.512
INFORMATION. THEY HAVE TO

01:56:59.579 --> 01:57:00.680
PROVIDE THE COURT ABOUT WHAT

01:57:00.747 --> 01:57:02.315
THEIR PROCESS HAS BEEN AND HOW

01:57:02.382 --> 01:57:04.484
THEY HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THE

01:57:04.550 --> 01:57:07.820
HOUSING SEARCH PROCESS, AND HOW

01:57:07.887 --> 01:57:09.155
THEY'VE BEEN PARTICIPATING IN

01:57:09.222 --> 01:57:10.723
THE HOUSING COMMUNITY, IN THE

01:57:10.790 --> 01:57:12.725
HOUSING COMMITTEE MEETINGS AND

01:57:12.792 --> 01:57:13.693
SPECIFIC INFORMATION TO THE

01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:15.361
COURT, FOR THE COURT TO

01:57:15.428 --> 01:57:17.163
DETERMINE THAT BASICALLY, THERE

01:57:17.230 --> 01:57:19.699
REALLY ISN'T ANY SUITABLE

01:57:19.766 --> 01:57:21.467
HOUSING IN THIS COUNTY IN ORDER

01:57:21.534 --> 01:57:23.603
TO MOVE TO ORDER US TO SEARCH.

01:57:23.669 --> 01:57:26.906
AND THAT LAW TOOK EFFECT IN

01:57:26.973 --> 01:57:30.443
2022. JANUARY 2022, 2023, 20

01:57:30.510 --> 01:57:33.379
2323. AND SO MY LAST QUESTION IS

01:57:33.446 --> 01:57:35.848
FOR LIBERTY. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE

01:57:35.915 --> 01:57:37.550
CHRISTOPHER HUBERT, THE

01:57:37.617 --> 01:57:39.719
PILLOWCASE PILLOWCASE RAPIST

01:57:39.786 --> 01:57:41.988
THAT RAPED, ADMITTED TO RAPING

01:57:42.054 --> 01:57:44.524
DOZENS OF WOMEN THAT WAS PLACED

01:57:44.590 --> 01:57:46.926
IN OUR COMMUNITY AGAINST OUR

01:57:46.993 --> 01:57:48.795
COMMUNITIES. VOIGTS, TO BE

01:57:48.861 --> 01:57:50.096
HONEST WITH YOU, PLACED IN OUR

01:57:50.163 --> 01:57:53.032
COMMUNITY IN 2014, HE VIOLATED

01:57:53.099 --> 01:57:58.104
HIS TERMS AND THEN WAS SENT

01:57:58.171 --> 01:58:00.273
BACK, I THINK THREE TIMES.

01:58:00.339 --> 01:58:01.607
RIGHT. THIS IS THE THIRD TIME IN

01:58:01.674 --> 01:58:03.543
HIS PLACEMENT THIS PAST MARCH OR

01:58:03.609 --> 01:58:07.146
THIS PAST WINTER. SO MY QUESTION

01:58:07.213 --> 01:58:09.348
TO YOU IS ONE, HOW DID THE

01:58:09.415 --> 01:58:10.550
RECOMMENDATION FOR HIM TO COME

01:58:10.616 --> 01:58:13.186
BACK INTO OUR COMMUNITY YET

01:58:13.252 --> 01:58:16.823
ALONE JUST BE RELEASED HAPPEN?

01:58:16.889 --> 01:58:19.725
TWO WHAT PROTOCOLS ARE IN PLACE?

01:58:19.792 --> 01:58:24.464
IF THE HIGH DESERT SVP VIOLATES

01:58:24.530 --> 01:58:25.932
THEIR TERMS, WHAT'S THE PROCESS?

01:58:25.998 --> 01:58:27.333
WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE?

01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:28.868
ACTUALLY, CAN I STEP IN FIRST

01:58:28.935 --> 01:58:30.503
AND THEN I'LL TURN IT OVER TO

01:58:30.570 --> 01:58:33.039
KEN, BECAUSE I DO WANT TO JUST

01:58:33.105 --> 01:58:34.507
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE

01:58:34.574 --> 01:58:35.608
PROCESS THAT HAPPENS AT THE

01:58:35.675 --> 01:58:37.276
STATE HOSPITAL. SO WHEN SOMEBODY

01:58:37.343 --> 01:58:40.980
IS RETURNED BACK TO THE REVOKED

01:58:41.047 --> 01:58:42.849
BACK INTO THE STATE HOSPITAL,

01:58:42.915 --> 01:58:44.784
THAT INDIVIDUAL IS AGAIN ENGAGES

01:58:44.851 --> 01:58:45.985
IN TREATMENT, AND THAT

01:58:46.052 --> 01:58:47.253
INDIVIDUAL HAS THE RIGHT, UNDER

01:58:47.320 --> 01:58:48.588
THE STATUTE, TO PETITION THE

01:58:48.654 --> 01:58:50.723
COURT FOR CONDITIONAL RELEASE

01:58:50.790 --> 01:58:53.593
AGAIN, SO THEY CAN CAN PETITION

01:58:53.659 --> 01:58:54.694
IF, YOU KNOW, A COURT DENIES

01:58:54.760 --> 01:58:56.496
THEM PETITION, CONDITIONAL

01:58:56.562 --> 01:58:57.563
RELEASE, THEY CAN PETITION. THEY

01:58:57.630 --> 01:58:59.398
HAVE TO WAIT A YEAR BEFORE THEY

01:58:59.465 --> 01:59:01.534
CAN PETITION AGAIN. SO THE

01:59:01.601 --> 01:59:03.202
INDIVIDUAL CAN PETITION THE

01:59:03.269 --> 01:59:06.639
COURT UNDER THE STATUTE. AND SO

01:59:06.706 --> 01:59:07.640
AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS BEEN

01:59:07.707 --> 01:59:09.542
REVOKED, AND WE'VE HAD MULTIPLE

01:59:09.609 --> 01:59:11.677
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE GONE BACK

01:59:11.744 --> 01:59:13.312
INTO THE STATE HOSPITAL,

01:59:13.379 --> 01:59:15.948
RECEIVED MORE TREATMENT, AND

01:59:16.015 --> 01:59:18.050
THEN ULTIMATELY, YOU KNOW,

01:59:18.117 --> 01:59:19.252
PETITIONED AND BEEN PLACED BACK

01:59:19.318 --> 01:59:20.720
OUT IN THE COMMUNITY AND BEEN

01:59:20.786 --> 01:59:23.089
SUCCESSFUL IN THE COMMUNITY. SO

01:59:23.155 --> 01:59:25.625
THERE IS A THEY DO WHEN THEY ARE,

01:59:25.691 --> 01:59:28.094
IF THEY ONCE THEY'RE REVOKED, IF

01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:29.729
THEY GO BACK INTO THE STATE

01:59:29.795 --> 01:59:30.830
HOSPITAL, THEY HAVE THE

01:59:30.897 --> 01:59:32.565
OPPORTUNITY TO REENGAGE IN

01:59:32.632 --> 01:59:35.668
TREATMENT. AND, YOU KNOW, AND

01:59:35.735 --> 01:59:38.971
WORK AGAIN, THOSE SKILLS TO TRY

01:59:39.038 --> 01:59:40.339
TO PETITION THE COURT AGAIN AND

01:59:40.406 --> 01:59:42.341
THEN GET RELEASED. SO NOW I'LL

01:59:42.408 --> 01:59:44.577
TURN IT OVER TO KEN, TO THAT.

01:59:44.644 --> 01:59:46.145
DOES THAT ANSWER THE FIRST PART

01:59:46.212 --> 01:59:48.114
OF THE QUESTION IN TERMS OF HOW

01:59:48.180 --> 01:59:49.582
THEY GET OUT? THEY PETITION THAT

01:59:49.649 --> 01:59:51.250
RELEASE. SO MAYBE I'LL FOCUS IN

01:59:51.317 --> 01:59:52.485
ON THE HOW DO THEY GO BACK IN.

01:59:52.552 --> 01:59:54.420
CORRECT. BUT I WOULD IMAGINE

01:59:54.487 --> 01:59:56.956
THAT YOUR LIBERTY IS PROVIDING

01:59:57.023 --> 01:59:58.357
SERVICES AND TREATMENT DURING

01:59:58.424 --> 02:00:00.960
THAT ENTIRE PROCESS. WHEN

02:00:01.027 --> 02:00:02.428
THEY'RE OUT, WE TAKE OVER THE

02:00:02.495 --> 02:00:03.496
TREATMENT WHEN THEY COME INTO

02:00:03.563 --> 02:00:05.965
THE COMMUNITY. OKAY. YEAH. SO

02:00:06.032 --> 02:00:07.466
INSIDE THE INSTITUTION, THE

02:00:07.533 --> 02:00:08.868
STATE HOSPITAL IS THE DEPARTMENT

02:00:08.935 --> 02:00:10.303
OF STATE HOSPITALS PROVIDING

02:00:10.369 --> 02:00:12.104
THAT TREATMENT. RIGHT. AND THEN

02:00:12.171 --> 02:00:13.205
THEY COME OUT INTO THE

02:00:13.272 --> 02:00:14.640
COMMUNITY. THAT PETITION IS

02:00:14.707 --> 02:00:16.208
HELD. THE COURT FINDS THAT THEY

02:00:16.275 --> 02:00:18.344
CAN BE SAFELY THEY CAN SAFELY

02:00:18.411 --> 02:00:19.345
CONTINUE THEIR TREATMENT INTO

02:00:19.412 --> 02:00:22.281
THE COMMUNITY. WE LOOK FOR

02:00:22.348 --> 02:00:23.849
HOUSING. WE SET UP THE SERVICES.

02:00:23.916 --> 02:00:26.218
SO THEN THEY ARE PLACED INTO THE

02:00:26.285 --> 02:00:27.520
COMMUNITY. SO WHEN IN THIS

02:00:27.587 --> 02:00:28.721
PARTICULAR AND I GUESS IN ANY

02:00:28.788 --> 02:00:30.790
INSTANCE, WHEN THEY GO BACK INTO

02:00:30.856 --> 02:00:32.491
STATE HOSPITAL AND THEY'RE GOING

02:00:32.558 --> 02:00:34.794
THROUGH THE PROCESS TO BE

02:00:34.860 --> 02:00:35.828
RELEASED AGAIN, I WOULD IMAGINE

02:00:35.895 --> 02:00:37.597
THAT HAVING WORKED WITH THAT

02:00:37.663 --> 02:00:39.932
PATIENT PREVIOUSLY, YOU WOULD BE

02:00:39.999 --> 02:00:41.701
A PART OF THE PROCESS AND THE

02:00:41.767 --> 02:00:43.069
RECOMMENDATION. AND WHY WOULD

02:00:43.135 --> 02:00:43.736
THAT RECOMMENDATION COME BACK TO

02:00:43.803 --> 02:00:45.871
THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY VIOLATED

02:00:45.938 --> 02:00:47.773
TERMS? SO THAT'S CORRECT. WE DO

02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:50.276
HAVE LIAISONS THAT GO INTO THE

02:00:50.343 --> 02:00:52.011
STATE HOSPITAL AND WORK WITH

02:00:52.078 --> 02:00:53.145
PERSONS THAT ARE WORKING THEIR

02:00:53.212 --> 02:00:55.348
WAY TOWARDS RELEASE. SO THERE IS

02:00:55.414 --> 02:00:56.349
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE

02:00:56.415 --> 02:00:57.850
CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAM AND

02:00:57.917 --> 02:00:59.552
THE STATE HOSPITAL. IN

02:00:59.619 --> 02:01:01.420
DISCUSSING THEIR PROGRESS, TEAM

02:01:01.487 --> 02:01:03.889
MEETINGS ARE HELD AND DISCUSSION

02:01:03.956 --> 02:01:06.058
DISCUSSING RISK ASSESSMENTS,

02:01:06.125 --> 02:01:07.827
KIND OF COMPLICATED DECISIONS

02:01:07.893 --> 02:01:09.729
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, HOW IS SOMEONE

02:01:09.795 --> 02:01:11.697
PREPARED TO GO BACK IN PREVIOUS

02:01:11.764 --> 02:01:13.566
FAILURES OR CERTAINLY TAKEN INTO

02:01:13.633 --> 02:01:15.801
ACCOUNT? ULTIMATELY, TEAMS AND

02:01:15.868 --> 02:01:17.670
CLINICIANS COME UP WITH THEIR

02:01:17.737 --> 02:01:19.739
OPINION. CAN THE PERSON BE

02:01:19.805 --> 02:01:22.274
SAFELY TREATED IN THE COMMUNITY?

02:01:22.341 --> 02:01:24.210
THOSE THOSE OPINIONS ARE WRITTEN

02:01:24.276 --> 02:01:25.411
AND GO BEFORE A COURT AND THE

02:01:25.478 --> 02:01:28.214
COURT DECIDES IT. SO I HOPE THAT

02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:29.515
GIVES INSIGHT INTO WHAT THAT

02:01:29.582 --> 02:01:31.217
LOOKS LIKE. THEN THE PERSON

02:01:31.283 --> 02:01:33.586
COMES BACK OUT. SO I DO WANT TO

02:01:33.653 --> 02:01:34.687
BE CLEAR. WE ARE ENGAGED WITH

02:01:34.754 --> 02:01:36.389
THE STATE HOSPITAL. LET'S SAY

02:01:36.455 --> 02:01:37.490
SOMEONE GOES BACK IN TO MAKE

02:01:37.556 --> 02:01:39.025
SURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT

02:01:39.091 --> 02:01:42.795
THE FAILURES WERE. THERE IS

02:01:42.862 --> 02:01:43.663
COMMUNICATION BACK AND FORTH

02:01:43.729 --> 02:01:45.865
BETWEEN THE STATE HOSPITAL AND

02:01:45.931 --> 02:01:46.966
THE CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAM.

02:01:47.033 --> 02:01:48.134
ONCE THEY GO BACK IN, THERE'S AN

02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:49.301
AFFIRMATIVE OBLIGATION BY THE

02:01:49.368 --> 02:01:50.503
STATE TO PROVIDE TREATMENT.

02:01:50.569 --> 02:01:52.471
THAT'S THE CONTEXT OF THIS LAW.

02:01:52.538 --> 02:01:54.073
REMEMBER, IT'S A CIVIL

02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:57.143
COMMITMENT FOR, YOU KNOW,

02:01:57.209 --> 02:01:58.744
DISORDERS THAT MAKE PEOPLE

02:01:58.811 --> 02:02:00.112
PREDISPOSED TO OFFENSE AND YOU

02:02:00.179 --> 02:02:02.014
HAVE TO TREAT THEM. IT'S A IT'S

02:02:02.081 --> 02:02:03.215
A MEDICAL THING THAT WE'VE

02:02:03.282 --> 02:02:04.817
DECIDED TO DO, TREAT SOMEONE FOR

02:02:04.884 --> 02:02:07.253
THEIR ILLNESS THAT MAKES THEM,

02:02:07.319 --> 02:02:09.021
YOU KNOW, POTENTIALLY RE-OFFEND.

02:02:09.088 --> 02:02:10.956
SO THERE'S AN OBLIGATION TO

02:02:11.023 --> 02:02:13.392
TREAT THEM. THEY PROGRESS IN

02:02:13.459 --> 02:02:15.861
TREATMENT, THEY PETITION AGAIN,

02:02:15.928 --> 02:02:17.063
CONSIDERATIONS ARE MADE,

02:02:17.129 --> 02:02:18.097
ASSESSMENTS ARE MADE, AND THE

02:02:18.164 --> 02:02:19.865
COURT MAY FIND THAT, OKAY, THEY

02:02:19.932 --> 02:02:22.001
CAN BE SAFELY TREATED AGAIN. WE

02:02:22.068 --> 02:02:23.903
THEN HAVE THOSE TERMS AND

02:02:23.969 --> 02:02:25.271
CONDITIONS. WE MAY HAVE ADJUSTED

02:02:25.337 --> 02:02:26.806
SOME OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS

02:02:26.872 --> 02:02:28.441
BECAUSE OF THEIR PREVIOUS

02:02:28.507 --> 02:02:30.676
ACTIVITIES. WE CONTINUE WITH THE

02:02:30.743 --> 02:02:32.445
VERY RIGOROUS SUPERVISION WE

02:02:32.511 --> 02:02:34.680
HAVE. OKAY, SO BUT YOU DIDN'T

02:02:34.747 --> 02:02:36.515
ANSWER MY QUESTION AT ALL AS TO

02:02:36.582 --> 02:02:38.350
IF SOMEONE WHAT ARE YOUR SAFETY

02:02:38.417 --> 02:02:40.119
PROTOCOLS FOR WHEN SOMEONE IS IN

02:02:40.186 --> 02:02:42.888
A COMMUNITY? AND YES, YES. SO

02:02:42.955 --> 02:02:45.458
OUR SUPERVISORY ACTIVITIES

02:02:45.524 --> 02:02:50.996
INCLUDE. CASE MANAGERS OVER

CASELOADS AS COMPARED TO, SAY,

02:02:55.534 --> 02:02:56.635
OTHER SETTINGS, RIGHT? WHERE WE

02:02:56.702 --> 02:02:59.472
HAVE WE AGAIN, WE UTILIZE FORMER

02:02:59.538 --> 02:03:01.340
PROBATION PAROLE OFFICERS OVER

02:03:01.407 --> 02:03:02.708
THESE CASES. THEY HAVE A

02:03:02.775 --> 02:03:06.245
CASELOAD OF, SAY THREE PEOPLE.

02:03:06.312 --> 02:03:08.114
THEY HAVE ADDITIONAL STAFF THAT

02:03:08.180 --> 02:03:10.249
WORK TO SUPPORT AND SUPPLEMENT

02:03:10.316 --> 02:03:12.184
THAT. THERE'S MULTIPLE CONTACTS

02:03:12.251 --> 02:03:14.620
EVERY DAY. THERE'S GPS

02:03:14.687 --> 02:03:15.621

02:03:15.688 --> 02:03:17.490
WHERE THEY ARE EVERY DAY.

02:03:17.556 --> 02:03:19.258
THERE'S TRACKING OF ALL THEIR

02:03:19.325 --> 02:03:22.728
SPENDING. IT'S A VERY INTENSIVE

02:03:22.795 --> 02:03:24.697
SUPERVISION PROGRAM. PROBABLY

02:03:24.764 --> 02:03:27.099
THE MOST INTENSIVE SUPERVISION

02:03:27.166 --> 02:03:29.735
PROGRAM THAT EXISTS, SUPERVISING

02:03:29.802 --> 02:03:32.471
AND LOOKING FOR TERMS AND

02:03:32.538 --> 02:03:34.673
CONDITION VIOLATIONS OR ANY

02:03:34.740 --> 02:03:36.909
SUSPICIOUS OR OUT OF BOUNDS

02:03:36.976 --> 02:03:38.344
ACTIVITIES. THAT'S THAT'S A BIG

02:03:38.410 --> 02:03:39.712
PART OF THE JOB. THE OTHER WING

02:03:39.779 --> 02:03:41.547
OF THIS IS THE TREATMENT ASPECT,

02:03:41.614 --> 02:03:43.482
RIGHT, WHERE WE HAVE CLINICIANS

02:03:43.549 --> 02:03:45.117
THAT ARE PROVIDING THAT

02:03:45.184 --> 02:03:47.186
TREATMENT, SUPPLEMENTING, TRYING

02:03:47.253 --> 02:03:49.088
TO HELP THEM ESTABLISH

02:03:49.155 --> 02:03:50.723
PRO-SOCIAL LIFESTYLES THAT WE

02:03:50.790 --> 02:03:53.092
KNOW MITIGATE AGAINST

02:03:53.159 --> 02:03:54.760
RE-OFFENSE. SO IT'S A IT'S A

02:03:54.827 --> 02:03:56.962
DUAL APPROACH OF ACCOUNTABILITY

02:03:57.029 --> 02:03:59.131
AND TREATMENT TO TRY TO SHORE UP

02:03:59.198 --> 02:04:01.534
THEIR OWN PRO-SOCIAL DECISIONS

02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:04.603
WITH RIGOROUS SUPERVISION. IF WE

02:04:04.670 --> 02:04:07.039
FIND ANY VIOLATIONS THAT THEY

02:04:07.106 --> 02:04:10.075
STRAY FOR ANY SORTS OF LONG LIST

02:04:10.142 --> 02:04:12.144
OF REASONS, WE MOVE ON THAT AND

02:04:12.211 --> 02:04:14.313
WE ACT ON THAT. AND QUITE, QUITE

02:04:14.380 --> 02:04:16.048
FRANKLY, BACK TO THE ISSUE OF

02:04:16.115 --> 02:04:17.917
KIND OF FAILURE. WE'RE ACTUALLY

02:04:17.983 --> 02:04:19.685
RELATIVELY CONSERVATIVE ON THAT.

02:04:19.752 --> 02:04:22.454
SO SMALL VIOLATIONS WE TAKE VERY

02:04:22.521 --> 02:04:23.289
SERIOUSLY BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH

02:04:23.355 --> 02:04:25.891
THEY'RE SMALL, WE KNOW THAT TO

02:04:25.958 --> 02:04:27.827
STEP DOWN THE WRONG PATH AND WE

02:04:27.893 --> 02:04:29.028
WILL INSTITUTIONALIZE SOMEBODY.

02:04:29.094 --> 02:04:30.796
THANK YOU. IT'S JUST ALL THIS

02:04:30.863 --> 02:04:34.333
HUMAN CAPITAL STATE RESOURCES.

02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:36.268
AND STILL OUR COMMUNITIES ARE

02:04:36.335 --> 02:04:39.305
LESS SAFE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

02:04:39.371 --> 02:04:41.707
SENATOR VÌ. NEXT, ASSEMBLYMEMBER

02:04:41.774 --> 02:04:44.844
DEMAIO, REFER TO MY COLLEAGUE

02:04:44.910 --> 02:04:46.812
FOR TIME. OKAY. AND THEN

02:04:46.879 --> 02:04:47.479
ASSEMBLYMEMBER CARRILLO. AND

02:04:47.546 --> 02:04:48.614
THEN SIMILARLY MEMBER RANSOM OR

02:04:48.681 --> 02:04:50.382
ACTUALLY I'M GOING TO LET HER GO

02:04:50.449 --> 02:04:52.051
FIRST AND THEN I'LL COME BACK.

02:04:52.117 --> 02:04:53.285
THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT. SO

02:04:53.352 --> 02:04:55.721
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I KNOW

02:04:55.788 --> 02:04:56.722
THESE ARE REALLY TOUGH

02:04:56.789 --> 02:04:58.991
QUESTIONS. AND I HAVE SOME

02:04:59.058 --> 02:05:01.427
QUESTIONS IN REGARDS TO THIS. SO

02:05:01.493 --> 02:05:02.928
I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IT

02:05:02.995 --> 02:05:05.431
SEEMS LIKE WE'RE SPENDING 11

02:05:05.497 --> 02:05:08.734
MILLION OR SO PER YEAR. IS 56

02:05:08.801 --> 02:05:10.970
THE NUMBER THE AVERAGE NUMBER.

02:05:11.036 --> 02:05:12.471
OR IS THAT JUST THE NUMBER THAT

02:05:12.538 --> 02:05:15.474
HAS GONE THROUGH THE PROGRAM?

02:05:15.541 --> 02:05:18.377
YEAH. GO AHEAD 56 IS OVER THE

02:05:18.444 --> 02:05:20.479
LIFE OF THE PROGRAM SINCE

02:05:20.546 --> 02:05:23.048
OPERATION IN 2003. OKAY. AND AS

02:05:23.115 --> 02:05:26.318
YOU'RE SERVING THESE THE FOLKS,

02:05:26.385 --> 02:05:28.988
WHAT IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS FOR

02:05:29.054 --> 02:05:30.456
THEM TO SOMEHOW BE TREATED WELL

02:05:30.522 --> 02:05:32.024
ENOUGH TO BE RELEASED? OR ARE

02:05:32.091 --> 02:05:35.661
THEY INTENDED TO KIND OF BE LIKE

02:05:35.728 --> 02:05:37.029
WARDS OF THE STATE THROUGH THIS

02:05:37.096 --> 02:05:37.663
PROGRAM IN PERPETUITY? CAN YOU

02:05:37.730 --> 02:05:40.399
HELP ME UNDERSTAND THAT? SURE.

02:05:40.466 --> 02:05:44.136
YEAH. NO, IT IT'S NOT TO OVERSEE

02:05:44.203 --> 02:05:47.172
THEM IN PERPETUITY IS TO HELP

02:05:47.239 --> 02:05:50.542
SUPPORT AS AS MR. CARABALLO

02:05:50.609 --> 02:05:53.312
SAID, PRO-SOCIAL BEHAVIORS TO

02:05:53.379 --> 02:05:55.781
DEMONSTRATE AND PUT INTO

02:05:55.848 --> 02:05:57.950
PRACTICE THE SKILLS AND THE

02:05:58.017 --> 02:05:59.351
BEHAVIORS THAT THEY HAVE LEARNED

02:05:59.418 --> 02:06:00.753
AND GAINED IN THE HOSPITAL AND

02:06:00.819 --> 02:06:03.689
PUT THAT IN INTO PRACTICE IN THE

02:06:03.756 --> 02:06:04.857
COMMUNITY, BUT IN A VERY

02:06:04.924 --> 02:06:07.993
CONTROLLED SETTING. ULTIMATELY,

02:06:08.060 --> 02:06:10.930
YOU KNOW, WITH WITH SIGNIFICANT

02:06:10.996 --> 02:06:12.665
PROGRESS, THAT INDIVIDUAL COULD

02:06:12.731 --> 02:06:14.433
THEN ACHIEVE CONDITIONAL

02:06:14.500 --> 02:06:17.469
RELEASE. WE HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF

02:06:17.536 --> 02:06:18.771
INDIVIDUALS UNCONDITIONALLY

02:06:18.837 --> 02:06:20.372
RELEASED FROM THE PROGRAM, OKAY.

02:06:20.439 --> 02:06:21.907
AND THOSE INCLUDE SOME OF THE

02:06:21.974 --> 02:06:22.908
ONES THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT

02:06:22.975 --> 02:06:24.977
TODAY, SOME OF THE STORIES THAT

02:06:25.044 --> 02:06:26.979
WE PROBABLY CONCERNED ABOUT ARE,

02:06:27.046 --> 02:06:28.480
WERE THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN

02:06:28.547 --> 02:06:30.049
THE PROGRAM. THOSE WEREN'T

02:06:30.115 --> 02:06:30.716
CONDITIONAL RELEASES. THOSE WERE

02:06:30.783 --> 02:06:32.751
PEOPLE THAT WERE CONTINUOUSLY

02:06:32.818 --> 02:06:34.586
BEING SERVED. THAT I WOULD SAY

02:06:34.653 --> 02:06:37.156
THAT THE EXAMPLES THAT THAT THAT

02:06:37.222 --> 02:06:40.492
HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED TODAY HAVE

02:06:40.559 --> 02:06:42.194
NOT BEEN UNCONDITIONALLY

02:06:42.261 --> 02:06:44.430
RELEASED. OKAY. THANK YOU. AND

02:06:44.496 --> 02:06:46.632
THEN AS WE LOOK AT I LOOKED AT,

02:06:46.699 --> 02:06:48.367
THERE'S A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT

02:06:48.434 --> 02:06:49.268
ARE WAITING AND THEY'RE WAITING

02:06:49.335 --> 02:06:51.136
LIKE IT SAYS AN AVERAGE OF 20

02:06:51.203 --> 02:06:53.605
MONTHS, BUT SOME OF THEM ARE,

02:06:53.672 --> 02:06:54.506
ARE JUST YEARS WAITING TO GET

02:06:54.573 --> 02:06:56.675
INTO THIS PROGRAM. AND SO I

02:06:56.742 --> 02:06:58.744
UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE

02:06:58.811 --> 02:07:00.512
HIGHLIGHTING, YOU KNOW, KIND OF

02:07:00.579 --> 02:07:01.780
SOME OF YOUR WHAT YOU HAVE

02:07:01.847 --> 02:07:04.049
DEEMED AS SOME OF YOUR

02:07:04.116 --> 02:07:05.584
SUCCESSES. BUT GIVEN THAT YOU

02:07:05.651 --> 02:07:07.353
CLEARLY HAVE A REALLY LONG

02:07:07.419 --> 02:07:10.723
WAITING LIST AND A VERY HIGH,

02:07:10.789 --> 02:07:12.825
YOU KNOW, PER CAPITA AMOUNT, I'M

02:07:12.891 --> 02:07:15.427
JUST TRYING TO WONDER, SO WHAT'S

02:07:15.494 --> 02:07:16.128
HAPPENING TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

02:07:16.195 --> 02:07:18.097
WAITING TO GET IN THE PROGRAM?

02:07:18.163 --> 02:07:21.066
ARE YOU TREATING THEM JUST IN

02:07:21.133 --> 02:07:22.434
THE HOSPITAL, BUT WAITING FOR

02:07:22.501 --> 02:07:27.006
THEM TO GET OUT? AND SO IS THAT.

02:07:27.072 --> 02:07:27.706
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

02:07:27.773 --> 02:07:28.874
THAT'S HOW THAT'S HAPPENING.

02:07:28.941 --> 02:07:30.709
THERE'S CURRENTLY 19 INDIVIDUALS

02:07:30.776 --> 02:07:31.910
THAT ARE PENDING PLACEMENT, AND

02:07:31.977 --> 02:07:33.278
YES, THEY ARE. THEY REMAIN IN

02:07:33.345 --> 02:07:35.114
THE STATE HOSPITAL IN PRE

02:07:35.180 --> 02:07:35.914
PLACEMENT STATUS, RECEIVING

02:07:35.981 --> 02:07:37.683
TREATMENT UNTIL THEY WE FIND A

02:07:37.750 --> 02:07:38.784
SUITABLE HOUSING LOCATION THAT

02:07:38.851 --> 02:07:40.119
GETS APPROVED BY THE COURT.

02:07:40.185 --> 02:07:41.954
OKAY. IS THIS TREATMENT IS THE

02:07:42.021 --> 02:07:43.522
DIFFERENCE LIKE THEIR LOCATION.

02:07:43.589 --> 02:07:44.523
IS IT LIKE YOU'RE GIVING THE

02:07:44.590 --> 02:07:46.625
PRETTY MUCH THE SAME TREATMENT

02:07:46.692 --> 02:07:48.360
BUT IN THE HOSPITAL SETTING

02:07:48.427 --> 02:07:53.432
VERSUS IN THE HOME SETTING?

02:07:53.499 --> 02:07:55.667
YEAH. SO YOU KNOW, AT THE

02:07:55.734 --> 02:07:57.069
HOSPITAL YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE

02:07:57.136 --> 02:07:58.537
MORE INTENSIVE INPATIENT

02:07:58.604 --> 02:08:00.639
TREATMENT WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL IN

02:08:00.706 --> 02:08:02.808
THE HOSPITAL WILL HAVE A TEAM OF

02:08:02.875 --> 02:08:04.710
CLINICIANS THAT ARE THERE EVERY

02:08:04.777 --> 02:08:07.179
SINGLE DAY THERE, THAT THEY HAVE

02:08:07.246 --> 02:08:08.981
A TREATMENT TEAM THAT IS

02:08:09.048 --> 02:08:12.217
GENERALLY A, MADE UP OF A

02:08:12.284 --> 02:08:13.585
PSYCHIATRIST, A PSYCHOLOGIST, A

02:08:13.652 --> 02:08:17.656
SOCIAL WORKER, REHAB THERAPIST,

02:08:17.723 --> 02:08:18.690
AND THEY'RE PROVIDING AN

02:08:18.757 --> 02:08:20.893
INTENSIVE KIND OF INPATIENT

02:08:20.959 --> 02:08:22.795
TREATMENT. WHEN YOU MOVE INTO

02:08:22.861 --> 02:08:24.797
THE CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAM,

02:08:24.863 --> 02:08:27.366
THIS IS, YOU KNOW, THIS IS HOW

02:08:27.433 --> 02:08:28.867
INDIVIDUALS WILL NOW RECEIVE

02:08:28.934 --> 02:08:31.603
TREATMENT IN A IN A SUPERVISED

02:08:31.670 --> 02:08:34.206
TREATMENT PROGRAM IN THE

02:08:34.273 --> 02:08:35.641
COMMUNITY. AND SO THEY WILL

02:08:35.707 --> 02:08:37.776
STILL HAVE A PSYCHIATRIST, THEY

02:08:37.843 --> 02:08:38.410
WILL STILL HAVE A PSYCHOLOGIST.

02:08:38.477 --> 02:08:39.578
THEY'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE A

02:08:39.645 --> 02:08:41.180
TEAM. BUT THOSE SERVICES MAY NOT

02:08:41.246 --> 02:08:42.448
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE, YOU

02:08:42.514 --> 02:08:45.417
KNOW, EVERY SINGLE DAY ON SITE

02:08:45.484 --> 02:08:46.351
ALL THE TIME LIKE WE DO IN A

02:08:46.418 --> 02:08:48.153
STATE HOSPITAL. IT'S GOING TO BE

02:08:48.220 --> 02:08:49.321
MORE DELIVERED LIKE WE WOULD A

02:08:49.388 --> 02:08:50.622
COMMUNITY TREATMENT MODEL. SO I

02:08:50.689 --> 02:08:52.224
DON'T KNOW IF, KEN, IF YOU WANT

02:08:52.291 --> 02:08:53.459
TO TALK ABOUT THAT TREATMENT.

02:08:53.525 --> 02:08:55.494
SURE. SO IT MOVES INTO WEEKLY

02:08:55.561 --> 02:08:57.963
INDIVIDUAL SESSIONS. ALSO GROUP

02:08:58.030 --> 02:09:00.866
SESSIONS, MORE OF AN OUTPATIENT

02:09:00.933 --> 02:09:02.534
MODEL OF TREATMENT WHERE THEY

02:09:02.601 --> 02:09:05.137
CONTINUE ON IN THE SAME THEMES.

02:09:05.204 --> 02:09:07.005
BUT NOW IT'S ADAPTED TO A

02:09:07.072 --> 02:09:10.109
COMMUNITY SETTING AND THE FOCUS

02:09:10.175 --> 02:09:11.477
BECOMES COMMUNITY SUCCESS.

02:09:11.543 --> 02:09:12.644
RIGHT? PUBLIC SAFETY BEING THE

02:09:12.711 --> 02:09:14.480
HIGHEST PRIORITY. THE

02:09:14.546 --> 02:09:16.081
ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS PRO-SOCIAL

02:09:16.148 --> 02:09:18.250
LIFE AS PART OF A REHABILITATION

02:09:18.317 --> 02:09:19.551
PROCESS THAT HOPEFULLY THEY CAN

02:09:19.618 --> 02:09:21.420
PASS THROUGH IT SUCCESSFULLY.

02:09:21.487 --> 02:09:22.821
OKAY. SO I'M JUST WONDERING JUST

02:09:22.888 --> 02:09:24.356
KIND OF BASED ON THE MODEL. AND

02:09:24.423 --> 02:09:27.826
SO I'M TALKING AS A PERSON WHO'S

02:09:27.893 --> 02:09:29.094
RUN A NONPROFIT THAT PROVIDES

02:09:29.161 --> 02:09:31.730
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN

02:09:31.797 --> 02:09:33.599
OUTPATIENT SETTINGS, YOU KNOW,

02:09:33.665 --> 02:09:35.334
CBT, ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT

02:09:35.400 --> 02:09:38.537
TYPES OF OFFENSES. AND I'M

02:09:38.604 --> 02:09:40.472
WONDERING, WHAT IS THERE AN

02:09:40.539 --> 02:09:42.975
ALTERNATIVE WHERE BECAUSE

02:09:43.041 --> 02:09:44.510
CLEARLY THE COMMUNITY SETTING

02:09:44.576 --> 02:09:46.979
THE WAITING LIST IS LONG. AND

02:09:47.045 --> 02:09:48.447
EVEN WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO PLACE

02:09:48.514 --> 02:09:49.314
SOMEONE WHO'S JUST ON SHOULD BE

02:09:49.381 --> 02:09:51.216
ON THE REGULAR SEXUAL, YOU KNOW,

02:09:51.283 --> 02:09:53.852
WITHOUT THE VIOLENCE PIECE, IT'S

02:09:53.919 --> 02:09:55.554
REALLY NOT. THE COMMUNITIES

02:09:55.621 --> 02:09:57.356
DON'T REALLY AREN'T REALLY OPEN

02:09:57.422 --> 02:09:59.591
TO IT. IT SOUNDS LIKE MOST OF

02:09:59.658 --> 02:10:02.728
YOUR WE'RE NOT SERVING A LOT OF

02:10:02.794 --> 02:10:04.196
PEOPLE. SO I'M JUST WONDERING,

02:10:04.263 --> 02:10:05.998
IS THERE AN ALTERNATIVE MODEL

02:10:06.064 --> 02:10:08.901
THAT COULD BE IN A CONTROLLED

02:10:08.967 --> 02:10:10.435
SETTING SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU HAVE

02:10:10.502 --> 02:10:12.771
IN YOUR HOSPITAL, WHERE YOU CAN

02:10:12.838 --> 02:10:14.406
ACTUALLY GET THESE PEOPLE OFF OF

02:10:14.473 --> 02:10:16.775
THE WAITING LIST AND, YOU KNOW,

02:10:16.842 --> 02:10:18.477
SERVE MORE PEOPLE AND ALSO KEEP

02:10:18.544 --> 02:10:20.712
THE COMMUNITY SAFE. HAVE YOU? I

02:10:20.779 --> 02:10:22.314
BRIEFLY SAW SOMETHING ABOUT

02:10:22.381 --> 02:10:23.315
ALTERNATIVES, BUT IS THERE

02:10:23.382 --> 02:10:25.117
SOMETHING TRANSITORY, TRANSITORY

02:10:25.184 --> 02:10:26.552
HOUSING MODEL. YES. SO THEY

02:10:26.618 --> 02:10:28.287
DON'T SUPPORT IT. AND THAT'S

02:10:28.353 --> 02:10:29.755
WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY. IS

02:10:29.821 --> 02:10:31.557
THERE SOMETHING IN BETWEEN? I

02:10:31.623 --> 02:10:33.358
KNOW I SAW THAT THE AUDITOR PUT

02:10:33.425 --> 02:10:34.793
SOMETHING OR THERE WAS MAYBE IT

02:10:34.860 --> 02:10:36.628
WAS TWO YEARS AGO. THERE WAS

02:10:36.695 --> 02:10:37.396
SOMETHING ABOUT STATE OWNED

02:10:37.462 --> 02:10:39.598
PROPERTY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

02:10:39.665 --> 02:10:40.199
IS THERE SOMETHING IN BETWEEN

02:10:40.265 --> 02:10:42.100
THAT YOU'VE CONSIDERED OR WOULD

02:10:42.167 --> 02:10:43.802
CONSIDER? YEAH, I APPRECIATE IT.

02:10:43.869 --> 02:10:45.237
AND WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE THE

02:10:45.304 --> 02:10:46.505
DIALOG WITH THE LEGISLATURE

02:10:46.572 --> 02:10:49.341
ABOUT THIS PROGRAM AND SOLUTIONS

02:10:49.408 --> 02:10:51.009
TO THE CHALLENGES. I MEAN, WE

02:10:51.076 --> 02:10:52.911
IT'S A DELICATE BALANCE OF, YOU

02:10:52.978 --> 02:10:54.580
KNOW, THE INDIVIDUAL HAS A

02:10:54.646 --> 02:10:55.647
CONSTITUTIONAL LIBERTY, RIGHT?

02:10:55.714 --> 02:10:57.182
THEY HAVE SERVED THEIR TIME IN

02:10:57.249 --> 02:10:59.251
PRISON. THEY HAVE THEY HAVE

02:10:59.318 --> 02:11:00.586
COMPLETED THEIR TREATMENT

02:11:00.652 --> 02:11:01.720
PROGRAM, AND THE COURT HAS

02:11:01.787 --> 02:11:03.088
ORDERED THEM TO OUTPATIENT

02:11:03.155 --> 02:11:05.691
TREATMENT STATUS. AND SO

02:11:05.757 --> 02:11:08.260
ULTIMATELY, YOU KNOW, BALANCING

02:11:08.327 --> 02:11:10.729
THAT RIGHT TO LIBERTY AS WELL AS

02:11:10.796 --> 02:11:13.165
OUR DESIRE AND NEED TO PROTECT

02:11:13.232 --> 02:11:17.002
PUBLIC SAFETY IS IT'S A DELICATE

02:11:17.069 --> 02:11:19.104
BALANCE TO ACHIEVE. AND SO

02:11:19.171 --> 02:11:21.206
ULTIMATELY, YOU KNOW, THE

02:11:21.273 --> 02:11:23.375
TRANSITIONAL FACILITY FOR THE

02:11:23.442 --> 02:11:25.110
REASONS THAT I PRESENTED IN MY

02:11:25.177 --> 02:11:29.381
OPENING COMMENTS AS. ASSEMBLY

02:11:29.448 --> 02:11:31.783
MEMBER TAMAYO MENTIONED, WE WERE

02:11:31.850 --> 02:11:33.785
DID NOT AGREE WITH THE AUDITOR'S

02:11:33.852 --> 02:11:35.988
RECOMMENDATION, BUT WE ARE HAPPY

02:11:36.054 --> 02:11:38.123
TO CONTINUE THE DIALOG AND TO,

02:11:38.190 --> 02:11:39.958
YOU KNOW, CONSIDER, YOU KNOW,

02:11:40.025 --> 02:11:41.827
AND HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

02:11:41.893 --> 02:11:43.695
POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS. OKAY. THANK

02:11:43.762 --> 02:11:45.464
YOU FOR THAT. AND I JUST WANT TO

02:11:45.530 --> 02:11:47.366
KIND OF END ON WHEN WE'RE

02:11:47.432 --> 02:11:48.900
TALKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THE

02:11:48.967 --> 02:11:50.269
CIVIL LIBERTIES OF PEOPLE WHO

02:11:50.335 --> 02:11:52.137
SHOULD HAVE BEEN RELEASED

02:11:52.204 --> 02:11:53.338
BECAUSE THEY'VE SERVED THEIR

02:11:53.405 --> 02:11:55.207
TIME. BUT THEN WE HAVE PEOPLE

02:11:55.274 --> 02:11:56.975
THAT HAVE BEEN ON THIS LIST FOR,

02:11:57.042 --> 02:11:58.810
YOU KNOW, UPWARDS OF TWO YEARS.

02:11:58.877 --> 02:12:00.379
WE REALLY HAVE TO RECONCILE

02:12:00.445 --> 02:12:03.682
THAT. AND THE COST OF THIS

02:12:03.749 --> 02:12:05.417
PROGRAM IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING

02:12:05.484 --> 02:12:06.918
THAT'S VERY CONCERNING. AND THE

02:12:06.985 --> 02:12:08.654
RISING COST IS GOING TO CONTINUE

02:12:08.720 --> 02:12:11.256
TO RISE. SO I DEFINITELY WANT TO

02:12:11.323 --> 02:12:12.824
CONTINUE THIS DIALOG. AND I DO

02:12:12.891 --> 02:12:14.092
THANK YOU GUYS FOR YOUR

02:12:14.159 --> 02:12:15.761
PATIENCE. I KNOW THESE ARE TOUGH

02:12:15.827 --> 02:12:17.195
QUESTIONS, BUT WE'RE TRYING TO

02:12:17.262 --> 02:12:19.398
FIGURE OUT WHERE TO GO FROM HERE

02:12:19.464 --> 02:12:20.465
AS WELL. SO THANK YOU FOR BEING

02:12:20.532 --> 02:12:22.501
HERE. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:12:22.567 --> 02:12:23.935
TAMAYO. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

02:12:24.002 --> 02:12:25.971
MEMBER RANSOM. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:12:26.038 --> 02:12:30.375
TAMAYO. THANK YOU. I'M

02:12:30.442 --> 02:12:32.477
STRUGGLING WITH WITH THE

02:12:32.544 --> 02:12:35.013
RESPONSES. JUST BECAUSE I HAVE

02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:37.649
DEALT WITH THIS PROGRAM UP CLOSE

02:12:37.716 --> 02:12:40.485
AND PERSONAL, ORGANIZING THE

02:12:40.552 --> 02:12:42.587
OPPOSITION TO STOP YOUR

02:12:42.654 --> 02:12:45.457
PLACEMENTS, TALKING TO THE

02:12:45.524 --> 02:12:48.026
PROPERTY OWNERS AND DISCOVERING

02:12:48.093 --> 02:12:49.361
THE TRUTH THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT

02:12:49.428 --> 02:12:52.597
THEY WERE MISLED. AND SO I DON'T

02:12:52.664 --> 02:12:55.267
KNOW HOW MUCH FAITH I HAVE. I

02:12:55.334 --> 02:12:57.369
DON'T HAVE ANY. I'LL JUST SAY I

02:12:57.436 --> 02:12:58.870
HAVE NO FAITH IN IN LIBERTY,

02:12:58.937 --> 02:13:01.640
HEALTH CARE IN PARTICULAR, TO

02:13:01.707 --> 02:13:04.509
GIVE ME AN HONEST ANSWER IN

02:13:04.576 --> 02:13:05.977
2022, IN RANCHO BERNARDO,

02:13:06.044 --> 02:13:08.547
LIBERTY HEALTH CARE TRIED TO

02:13:08.613 --> 02:13:12.050
PLACE AN SVP, DOUG BADGER, IN

02:13:12.117 --> 02:13:13.518
THAT COMMUNITY IN RANCHO

02:13:13.585 --> 02:13:16.755
BERNARDO, NEAR IN AN ELDERLY

02:13:16.822 --> 02:13:20.258
COMMUNITY NEAR A SCHOOL NEAR A

02:13:20.325 --> 02:13:24.029
PARK. TWO AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS

02:13:24.096 --> 02:13:27.499
IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA, ONE BLOCK

02:13:27.566 --> 02:13:30.502
AWAY FROM A SCHOOL BUS STOP. A

02:13:30.569 --> 02:13:34.106
SPECIAL NEEDS CHILD LIVED ON THE

02:13:34.172 --> 02:13:36.174
STREET OF THE PLACEMENT, AND

02:13:36.241 --> 02:13:38.009
ULTIMATELY THE PROPERTY OWNER

02:13:38.076 --> 02:13:39.811
WITHDREW THE PROPERTY FROM THE

02:13:39.878 --> 02:13:43.048
PROGRAM AND TOLD ME THAT HE WAS

02:13:43.115 --> 02:13:45.016
TOLD THAT THIS WAS A PLACEMENT

02:13:45.083 --> 02:13:47.052
AS PART OF A GOVERNMENT HEALTH

02:13:47.119 --> 02:13:48.787
CARE PROGRAM, NOT A CRIMINAL

02:13:48.854 --> 02:13:51.723
JUSTICE PROGRAM, A HEALTH CARE

02:13:51.790 --> 02:13:54.993
PROGRAM. AND THIS IS NOT JUST

02:13:55.060 --> 02:13:56.228
ONE PERSON. I WOULD I WOULD

02:13:56.294 --> 02:13:57.729
PERHAPS GIVE YOU THE BENEFIT OF

02:13:57.796 --> 02:13:59.498
THE DOUBT THAT SOMEONE JUST

02:13:59.564 --> 02:14:00.599
INVENTS A STORY THAT THEY

02:14:00.665 --> 02:14:03.335
WEREN'T KNOWLEDGEABLE AS TO WHAT

02:14:03.402 --> 02:14:05.504
THEY WERE DOING. BUT

02:14:05.570 --> 02:14:07.139
CONSISTENTLY, WE'RE HEARING THIS

02:14:07.205 --> 02:14:10.776
FROM THE UNSUCCESSFUL PLACEMENTS

02:14:10.842 --> 02:14:11.843
WHERE THE PROPERTY OWNERS

02:14:11.910 --> 02:14:13.712
THEMSELVES TERMINATE AND LEAVE

02:14:13.779 --> 02:14:15.580
THE PROGRAM AND DON'T WANT TO

02:14:15.647 --> 02:14:17.282
RENT THEIR PROPERTY ANYMORE.

02:14:17.349 --> 02:14:18.550
THAT'S WHY I ASKED THE AUDITOR

02:14:18.617 --> 02:14:20.552
WHETHER THEY HAD SPOKEN TO THESE

02:14:20.619 --> 02:14:21.520
PROPERTY OWNERS WHO LEFT THE

02:14:21.586 --> 02:14:24.156
PROGRAM, BECAUSE I THINK THAT

02:14:24.222 --> 02:14:26.258
FAILURE TO PLACE MIGHT

02:14:26.324 --> 02:14:28.393
ILLUSTRATE THAT WE HAVE A BIGGER

02:14:28.460 --> 02:14:29.161
PROBLEM THAN JUST INTERNAL

02:14:29.227 --> 02:14:31.696
CONTROLS AND PROCESSES. THIS IS

02:14:31.763 --> 02:14:33.398
NOT A POLICY OR A MANAGEMENT

02:14:33.465 --> 02:14:36.368
WEAKNESS. THERE IS A FUNDAMENTAL

02:14:36.435 --> 02:14:37.869
INTEGRITY PROBLEM WITH THE

02:14:37.936 --> 02:14:39.805
VENDOR THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH

02:14:39.871 --> 02:14:41.473
HERE. AND I HAVE TO BE BLUNT,

02:14:41.540 --> 02:14:42.474
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I HAVE

02:14:42.541 --> 02:14:44.910
PERSONALLY EXPERIENCED. YOU CAN

02:14:44.976 --> 02:14:47.412
IMPROVE POLICIES, YOU CAN

02:14:47.479 --> 02:14:49.948
IMPLEMENT INTERNAL CONTROLS. YOU

02:14:50.015 --> 02:14:53.318
CAN'T CHANGE AN INTEGRITY

02:14:53.385 --> 02:14:55.787
PROBLEM. YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG

02:14:55.854 --> 02:14:59.891
VENDOR. SO THE QUESTION THAT I

02:14:59.958 --> 02:15:01.526
HAVE IS WE'VE GOT THE WRONG

02:15:01.593 --> 02:15:03.862
VENDOR. BUT I THINK WE ALSO HAVE

02:15:03.929 --> 02:15:06.231
THE WRONG AGENCY OVERSEEING THE

02:15:06.298 --> 02:15:10.535
PROGRAM. THE AUDIT READS QUOTE D

02:15:10.602 --> 02:15:15.607
D H HAS ALLOWED SEVERAL KNOWN

02:15:15.674 --> 02:15:18.076
DEFICIENCIES TO PERSIST SINCE AT

02:15:18.143 --> 02:15:20.579
LEAST 2019 WITHOUT HOLDING

02:15:20.645 --> 02:15:22.747
LIBERTY HEALTHCARE ACCOUNTABLE

02:15:22.814 --> 02:15:24.583
FOR IMPLEMENTING TIMELY

02:15:24.649 --> 02:15:27.185
RESOLUTIONS. NOW, THIS IS NOT A

02:15:27.252 --> 02:15:29.221
PROGRAM REGARDING WELFARE

02:15:29.287 --> 02:15:31.790
BENEFITS, A PROGRAM REGARDING

02:15:31.857 --> 02:15:33.258
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS. THIS

02:15:33.325 --> 02:15:35.360
IS A PROGRAM DEALING WITH THE

02:15:35.427 --> 02:15:38.697
WORST OFFENDERS THAT WE KNOW,

02:15:38.763 --> 02:15:40.098
PEOPLE WHO ARE CLINICALLY

02:15:40.165 --> 02:15:41.967
DIAGNOSED BY THE EXPERTS TO HAVE

02:15:42.033 --> 02:15:44.503
A HIGH PROCLIVITY TO REOFFEND

02:15:44.569 --> 02:15:46.204
SEXUALLY AGAINST MEMBERS OF THE

02:15:46.271 --> 02:15:51.276
COMMUNITY, AND THE IDEA THAT.

02:15:51.343 --> 02:15:54.045
KNOWINGLY ALLOWED DEFICIENCIES

02:15:54.112 --> 02:15:55.881
TO PERSIST FOR YEARS WITHOUT

02:15:55.947 --> 02:16:00.986
CORRECTION. I MEAN, THIS IS

02:16:01.052 --> 02:16:02.787
GROSS NEGLIGENCE OF THE HIGHEST

02:16:02.854 --> 02:16:04.589
ORDER. SO NOT ONLY DO I NOT

02:16:04.656 --> 02:16:06.558
TRUST THE VENDOR, I DON'T TRUST

02:16:06.625 --> 02:16:07.792
THE GOVERNMENT AGENCY

02:16:07.859 --> 02:16:11.062
IMPLEMENTED IMPLEMENTING THE AND

02:16:11.129 --> 02:16:14.966
THE CONTRACT ITSELF. AGAIN, I

02:16:15.033 --> 02:16:16.801
SPEAK TO THE GOVERNOR HERE

02:16:16.868 --> 02:16:18.103
BECAUSE ONLY THE GOVERNOR CAN

02:16:18.169 --> 02:16:19.204
TAKE IMMEDIATE, IMMEDIATE

02:16:19.271 --> 02:16:21.306
ACTION. IT WILL TAKE TIME TO GET

02:16:21.373 --> 02:16:23.608
THE LEGISLATURE TO ACT. BUT THE

02:16:23.675 --> 02:16:25.176
GOVERNOR COULD PUT AN END TO

02:16:25.243 --> 02:16:27.546
THIS HIGH RISK PROGRAM TODAY,

02:16:27.612 --> 02:16:29.114
WITH AN EXECUTIVE ORDER

02:16:29.180 --> 02:16:32.350
DECLARING AN EMERGENCY. I WANT

02:16:32.417 --> 02:16:35.120
TO TALK ABOUT THIS ISSUE OF

02:16:35.186 --> 02:16:36.221
TRANSITORY PLACEMENT, BECAUSE I

02:16:36.288 --> 02:16:41.927
THINK THAT POTENTIALLY BECOMES A

02:16:41.993 --> 02:16:42.594
SOLUTION, AT LEAST AN

02:16:42.661 --> 02:16:44.930
IMPROVEMENT OVER OUR STATUS QUO.

02:16:44.996 --> 02:16:50.869
HAS LIBERTY, HEALTH CARE OR DSH

02:16:50.936 --> 02:16:53.104
SIGNED OFF ON TRANSITORY

02:16:53.171 --> 02:16:55.140
TRANSIENT PLACEMENT IN A COURT

02:16:55.206 --> 02:16:57.709
OF LAW IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS?

02:16:57.776 --> 02:17:00.078
THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION. SO

02:17:00.145 --> 02:17:02.013
WITH RESPECT TO INDIVIDUALS WHO

02:17:02.080 --> 02:17:03.949
HAVE BEEN ORDERED OUT, TRANSIENT

02:17:04.015 --> 02:17:05.750
DSH NOR LIBERTY PROPOSES

02:17:05.817 --> 02:17:07.619
TRANSIENT AND WE DO NOT SUPPORT

02:17:07.686 --> 02:17:10.522
TRANSIENT RELEASES, WE ARE WE

02:17:10.589 --> 02:17:12.190
WILL CONTINUE SOMEBODY IN THAT

02:17:12.257 --> 02:17:13.758
PLACEMENT PROCESS WHILE WE

02:17:13.825 --> 02:17:15.760
CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR A HOME

02:17:15.827 --> 02:17:18.597
UNTIL WE FIND A SUITABLE HOUSE,

02:17:18.663 --> 02:17:19.831
AND THAT IT GETS APPROVED BY THE

02:17:19.898 --> 02:17:20.565
COURT. HOWEVER, COURTS HAVE

02:17:20.632 --> 02:17:22.767
ORDERED US TO PREPARE TRANSIENT

02:17:22.834 --> 02:17:24.269
RELEASE PLANS, AND WHEN WE ARE

02:17:24.336 --> 02:17:25.971
ORDERED TO PREPARE A TRANSIENT

02:17:26.037 --> 02:17:27.238
RELEASE PLAN, THEN LIBERTY

02:17:27.305 --> 02:17:29.140
HEALTH CARE, ALONG WITH THE

02:17:29.207 --> 02:17:29.708
DEPARTMENT, WILL WORK TO DO

02:17:29.774 --> 02:17:31.610
THAT. SO THE DEPARTMENT AND

02:17:31.676 --> 02:17:33.445
LIBERTY DO NOT PROPOSE TO THE

02:17:33.511 --> 02:17:35.280
COURT? NO. LET ME BE VERY

02:17:35.347 --> 02:17:37.382
SPECIFIC. HAVE YOU ENGAGED AN EX

02:17:37.449 --> 02:17:39.851
PARTE COMMUNICATION WITH THE

02:17:39.918 --> 02:17:42.887
COURTS REGARDING HOW TRANSIENT

02:17:42.954 --> 02:17:45.056
PLACEMENT WOULD WORK PRIOR TO

02:17:45.123 --> 02:17:47.926
THE JUDGE'S ORDER? HAVE YOU

02:17:47.993 --> 02:17:50.762
FACILITATED PROVIDED A JUDGE

02:17:50.829 --> 02:17:53.098
THAT OPTION FOR THE JUDGE TO

02:17:53.164 --> 02:17:55.100
CONSIDER? YES OR NO? I WANT AN

02:17:55.166 --> 02:17:55.867
HONEST ANSWER BECAUSE WE'RE

02:17:55.934 --> 02:17:57.736
GOING TO BE GOING DOWN THAT ROAD

02:17:57.802 --> 02:17:59.371
BECAUSE THESE ARE ALL

02:17:59.437 --> 02:18:00.672
DISCOVERABLE QUESTIONS. I DON'T

02:18:00.739 --> 02:18:02.273
THINK I'M FULLY UNDERSTANDING

02:18:02.340 --> 02:18:03.274
THE QUESTION BECAUSE I

02:18:03.341 --> 02:18:04.809
UNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION TO BE

02:18:04.876 --> 02:18:06.311
ABOUT TRANSIENT RELEASES. HAS

02:18:06.378 --> 02:18:09.881
THIS IDEA COME FROM DSH OR

02:18:09.948 --> 02:18:11.983
LIBERTY AS IT RELATES TO EX

02:18:12.050 --> 02:18:13.818
PARTE COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE

02:18:13.885 --> 02:18:15.787
JUDGE NOT IN A COURTROOM TO GIVE

02:18:15.854 --> 02:18:18.223
THE JUDGE ANOTHER OPTION BESIDES

02:18:18.289 --> 02:18:20.725
RESIDENTIAL PLACEMENT? I DON'T

02:18:20.792 --> 02:18:22.727
THINK I'M FULLY UNDERSTANDING

02:18:22.794 --> 02:18:23.828
THE QUESTION THEN. OKAY, I THINK

02:18:23.895 --> 02:18:27.132
THE I WILL TELL YOU THIS, THAT

02:18:27.198 --> 02:18:29.601
THAT WHERE THIS PROGRAM HAS NOW

02:18:29.668 --> 02:18:31.670
BROKEN DOWN IS WE NOW HAVE A

02:18:31.736 --> 02:18:34.305
GOVERNMENT AGENCY AND A VENDOR

02:18:34.372 --> 02:18:36.474
SUPPORTING TRANSIENT PLACEMENT,

02:18:36.541 --> 02:18:38.276
WHICH MEANS WE DON'T HAVE A

02:18:38.343 --> 02:18:39.678
LOCATION THAT THEY'RE JUST OUT

02:18:39.744 --> 02:18:41.880
THERE IN THE COMMUNITY WANDERING

02:18:41.946 --> 02:18:43.748
AROUND. AND YOU SAY, WELL, WE

02:18:43.815 --> 02:18:45.183
CAN STILL SUPPORT THAT. WE DON'T

02:18:45.250 --> 02:18:46.818
WE DON'T ADVOCATE FOR IT. WINK,

02:18:46.885 --> 02:18:48.520
NOD, BUT WE STILL SUPPORT THAT.

02:18:48.586 --> 02:18:50.522
OH, I CAN GUARANTEE YOU THAT THE

02:18:50.588 --> 02:18:51.690
DEPARTMENT AND LIBERTY GO ON

02:18:51.756 --> 02:18:54.426
RECORD IN THE COURT THAT WE DO

02:18:54.492 --> 02:18:55.927
NOT PROPOSE, AND WE DO NOT

02:18:55.994 --> 02:18:57.262
SUPPORT PLACEMENTS IN THE

02:18:57.328 --> 02:18:58.596
DOCUMENTS THAT LIBERTY FILES

02:18:58.663 --> 02:19:00.465
WITH THE COURT INDICATES THAT IT

02:19:00.532 --> 02:19:02.901
DOES NOT SUPPORT. BUT YOU HAVE

02:19:02.967 --> 02:19:05.370
NO PROBLEM CASHING CHECKS IF A

02:19:05.437 --> 02:19:07.038
IF A PLACEMENT IS MADE

02:19:07.105 --> 02:19:08.173
TRANSIENT, YOU HAVE NO PROBLEM

02:19:08.239 --> 02:19:09.340
CASHING THOSE CHECKS AND

02:19:09.407 --> 02:19:10.008
PROCEEDING FORWARD AND

02:19:10.075 --> 02:19:11.042
IMPLEMENTING. IS THAT RIGHT?

02:19:11.109 --> 02:19:13.144
YEAH. WE DON'T SUPPORT TRANSIENT

02:19:13.211 --> 02:19:14.646
RELEASES. THAT IS NOT YOU'LL DO

02:19:14.713 --> 02:19:16.381
THE WORK TO DO IT. IF ASKED TO

02:19:16.448 --> 02:19:18.450
DO IT, WE WILL SUPERVISE. IF THE

02:19:18.516 --> 02:19:19.918
COURT ORDERS IT, WE'LL PROVIDE

02:19:19.984 --> 02:19:22.587
THE CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAM.

02:19:22.654 --> 02:19:25.957
YES, WE HAVE TO DO IT WHEN THE

02:19:26.024 --> 02:19:29.094
COURT ORDERS IT. I, I FRANKLY

02:19:29.160 --> 02:19:30.595
DISAGREE WITH THAT. IF A VENDOR

02:19:30.662 --> 02:19:31.730
SAYS THAT'S SIMPLY NOT ETHICAL,

02:19:31.796 --> 02:19:34.766
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT I WILL

02:19:34.833 --> 02:19:36.034
ENGAGE IN. YOU DON'T HAVE TO

02:19:36.101 --> 02:19:39.104
ENGAGE IN THAT PRACTICE. SB 1034

02:19:39.170 --> 02:19:41.339
PROVIDES FOR EXTRAORDINARY

02:19:41.406 --> 02:19:43.808
CIRCUMSTANCES FOR OUT OF COUNTY

02:19:43.875 --> 02:19:46.611
RELEASE. CAN THE LEGISLATURE

02:19:46.678 --> 02:19:50.749
MODIFY STATUTORY LAW TO ALLOW

02:19:50.815 --> 02:19:52.250
FOR OUT OF COUNTY PLACEMENT IN A

02:19:52.317 --> 02:19:53.551
MORE STREAMLINED MANNER? ARE

02:19:53.618 --> 02:19:55.286
THERE REFINEMENTS THAT WE CAN

02:19:55.353 --> 02:19:56.921
MAKE IN STATUTE TO MAKE IT

02:19:56.988 --> 02:19:58.923
EASIER FOR OUT OF COUNTY, OUT OF

02:19:58.990 --> 02:20:00.859
ORIGINAL DOMICILE COUNTY

02:20:00.925 --> 02:20:02.961
PLACEMENT TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR

02:20:03.027 --> 02:20:04.763
ORIGINAL? I DON'T HAVE ANY

02:20:04.829 --> 02:20:06.064
RECOMMENDATIONS WITH RESPECT TO

02:20:06.131 --> 02:20:07.232
THAT TODAY, BUT WE THE

02:20:07.298 --> 02:20:09.134
LEGISLATURE DOES HAVE THE

02:20:09.200 --> 02:20:10.602
LEGISLATURE HAS THE POWER TO

02:20:10.668 --> 02:20:11.903
REMOVE THAT BARRIER THAT YOU

02:20:11.970 --> 02:20:14.305
HAVE BROUGHT UP REGARDING

02:20:14.372 --> 02:20:15.974
TRANSITORY HOUSING. IN OTHER

02:20:16.040 --> 02:20:17.742
WORDS, IF WE FIND A LOCATION, A

02:20:17.809 --> 02:20:19.377
SPECIFIC SPOT IN THE STATE, WHAT

02:20:19.444 --> 02:20:20.378
YOU'RE SAYING IS, WELL, THE

02:20:20.445 --> 02:20:22.647
REASON WHY THAT DOESN'T WORK,

02:20:22.714 --> 02:20:23.481
IT'S NOT PRACTICAL IS WE'RE

02:20:23.548 --> 02:20:25.116
GOING TO HAVE OPPOSITION. YOU'RE

02:20:25.183 --> 02:20:25.917
GOING TO HAVE OPPOSITION NO

02:20:25.984 --> 02:20:27.585
MATTER WHERE YOU TRY TO PLACE

02:20:27.652 --> 02:20:29.187
THESE FOLKS. BUT IF YOU HAVE A

02:20:29.254 --> 02:20:30.388
SPECIFIC LOCATION, A SPECIFIC

02:20:30.455 --> 02:20:31.356
FACILITY THAT CAN BE PREPLANNED,

02:20:31.422 --> 02:20:32.690
PRE-THOUGHT OUT, FAR AWAY, WHAT

02:20:32.757 --> 02:20:34.592
YOU'RE SAYING IS, WELL, IT'S WE

02:20:34.659 --> 02:20:36.427
CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE WE CAN'T

02:20:36.494 --> 02:20:37.729
PLACE THEM OUTSIDE OF THEIR

02:20:37.796 --> 02:20:39.631
ORIGINAL DOMICILE COUNTY. IS

02:20:39.697 --> 02:20:41.499
THAT CORRECT? UNDER STATE LAW,

02:20:41.566 --> 02:20:43.168
UNLESS THERE'S BEEN

02:20:43.234 --> 02:20:43.735
EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES

02:20:43.802 --> 02:20:44.969
ORDERED BY THE COURT,

02:20:45.036 --> 02:20:45.837
LEGISLATURE CAN ALWAYS FIX THAT

02:20:45.904 --> 02:20:47.172
PROBLEM FOR YOU. CORRECT. IF WE

02:20:47.238 --> 02:20:49.474
REMOVE THAT PROBLEM, THAT WOULD

02:20:49.541 --> 02:20:51.509
NOT BE AN OBJECTION TO

02:20:51.576 --> 02:20:52.410
TRANSITORY HOUSING PLACEMENT.

02:20:52.477 --> 02:20:54.145
THE DEPARTMENT WOULD BE HAPPY TO

02:20:54.212 --> 02:20:55.914
CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS AROUND

02:20:55.980 --> 02:20:58.316
IT. WHAT'S SO FRUSTRATING ABOUT

02:20:58.383 --> 02:21:00.151
THIS IS IT SEEMS AS THOUGH WE

02:21:00.218 --> 02:21:02.320
HAVE A FAILED PROGRAM, AND THE

02:21:02.387 --> 02:21:04.122
PEOPLE IN CHARGE OF THE PROGRAM

02:21:04.189 --> 02:21:06.357
ARE KIND OF DEAD SET, DIGGING

02:21:06.424 --> 02:21:08.426
THEIR FEET IN THEIR THEIR NAILS

02:21:08.493 --> 02:21:10.395
IN SAYING, NO, WE'RE JUST GOING

02:21:10.461 --> 02:21:12.130
TO DO A BETTER JOB. I DON'T

02:21:12.197 --> 02:21:14.132
TRUST YOU TO DO A BETTER JOB. I

02:21:14.199 --> 02:21:15.533
DON'T TRUST YOUR REPRESENTATIONS

02:21:15.600 --> 02:21:17.435
BECAUSE I HAVE I'VE HEARD TOO

02:21:17.502 --> 02:21:18.102
MANY HORROR STORIES ABOUT PEOPLE

02:21:18.169 --> 02:21:19.170
BEING TOLD ONE THING, COMMUNITY

02:21:19.237 --> 02:21:20.405
MEMBERS NOT BEING GIVEN THE

02:21:20.471 --> 02:21:21.739
TRUTH. I WENT OUT TO BORREGO

02:21:21.806 --> 02:21:24.242
SPRINGS, LIBERTY IN IN THE COURT

02:21:24.309 --> 02:21:27.912
HEARING, SAID, WE'RE GOING TO DO

02:21:27.979 --> 02:21:30.048
MONITORING BY ELECTRONIC DEVICE.

02:21:30.114 --> 02:21:31.449
BORREGO SPRINGS HAS SOME OF THE

02:21:31.516 --> 02:21:34.118
WORST CELL SERVICE OF ANY PART

02:21:34.185 --> 02:21:35.753
OF MY DISTRICT. IT'S IN THE

02:21:35.820 --> 02:21:37.622
MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. YOU GO OUT

02:21:37.689 --> 02:21:39.324
THERE, THERE IS NO CELL SERVICE.

02:21:39.390 --> 02:21:40.758
BRIAN JONES HAS BEEN OUT THERE.

02:21:40.825 --> 02:21:42.560
WE DON'T HAVE CELL SERVICE TO

02:21:42.627 --> 02:21:44.462
CONTINUE TO MONITOR FOLKS. AND

02:21:44.529 --> 02:21:46.564
SO TIME AFTER TIME

02:21:46.631 --> 02:21:47.565
REPRESENTATIONS ARE MADE.

02:21:47.632 --> 02:21:49.167
COMMUNITY MEMBERS KNOW THAT IT'S

02:21:49.234 --> 02:21:52.637
NOT TRUE. AND SO TODAY WHEN I

02:21:52.704 --> 02:21:54.472
HEAR, YES, WE'VE IMPLEMENTED

02:21:54.539 --> 02:21:56.274
FOUR OUT OF THE FIVE AUDIT

02:21:56.341 --> 02:21:57.709
RECOMMENDATIONS, I DON'T BUY IT.

02:21:57.775 --> 02:21:59.244
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING TO

02:21:59.310 --> 02:22:00.678
KEEP YOUR WORD. AND YET EVERY

02:22:00.745 --> 02:22:02.747
IDEA THAT COMES UP THAT SEEMS TO

02:22:02.814 --> 02:22:05.450
MOVE IT OUT OF THE OLD PARADIGM,

02:22:05.516 --> 02:22:06.784
THERE'S A REASON WHY WE CAN'T

02:22:06.851 --> 02:22:09.988
IMPLEMENT IT. SO MY, MY, MY MOST

02:22:10.054 --> 02:22:11.890
SINCERE CALL TO ACTION IS FIRST

02:22:11.956 --> 02:22:13.491
TO THE GOVERNOR TO IMMEDIATELY

02:22:13.558 --> 02:22:14.826
STOP THIS PROGRAM THROUGH AN

02:22:14.893 --> 02:22:16.027
EXECUTIVE ORDER, AN EMERGENCY

02:22:16.094 --> 02:22:18.496
EXECUTIVE ORDER. AND SECONDLY,

02:22:18.563 --> 02:22:19.597
TO MY COLLEAGUES IN THE

02:22:19.664 --> 02:22:21.666
LEGISLATURE WHO DON'T REPRESENT

02:22:21.733 --> 02:22:22.500
RURAL DISTRICTS, AS SEVERAL OF

02:22:22.567 --> 02:22:27.605
US DO UNDERSTAND WHAT A CRISIS

02:22:27.672 --> 02:22:29.073
SITUATION THIS IS FOR OUR

02:22:29.140 --> 02:22:30.174
DISTRICTS. IF IT WERE HAPPENING

02:22:30.241 --> 02:22:31.542
IN YOUR DISTRICT, YOU WOULD BE

02:22:31.609 --> 02:22:33.645
SITTING IN THIS ROOM ARGUING

02:22:33.711 --> 02:22:35.246
THESE POINTS AND ASKING THE

02:22:35.313 --> 02:22:37.248
TOUGH QUESTIONS. AND IT IS MY

02:22:37.315 --> 02:22:39.484
HOPE THAT WE NOT SEE THIS AS A

02:22:39.550 --> 02:22:41.252
PARTIZAN ISSUE. THIS HAS GOT TO

02:22:41.319 --> 02:22:42.353
BE A BIPARTISAN COMMITMENT TO

02:22:42.420 --> 02:22:43.421
DEAL WITH THIS. I UNDERSTAND

02:22:43.488 --> 02:22:44.822
THAT THIS IS PERHAPS ONE OF THE

02:22:44.889 --> 02:22:47.325
WORST CHALLENGING PROGRAMS OUT

02:22:47.392 --> 02:22:49.594
THERE. THESE ARE PEOPLE, AS YOU

02:22:49.661 --> 02:22:50.561
SAY TO YOUR POINT, HAVE

02:22:50.628 --> 02:22:52.363
COMPLETED THEIR CRIMINAL

02:22:52.430 --> 02:22:54.632
SENTENCE, BUT THAT THE EXPERTS

02:22:54.699 --> 02:22:57.368
HAVE DIAGNOSED AS HAVING A HIGH

02:22:57.435 --> 02:22:59.671
RISK POTENTIAL FOR RE-OFFENSE.

02:22:59.737 --> 02:23:01.606
AND SO, IN THE INTEREST OF

02:23:01.673 --> 02:23:03.174
PUBLIC SAFETY, WE ARE TRYING TO

02:23:03.241 --> 02:23:07.512
BALANCE RIGHTS AND PROCEDURES.

02:23:07.578 --> 02:23:09.814
IT'S NOT AN EASY PROGRAM TO

02:23:09.881 --> 02:23:11.549
IMPLEMENT, BUT SURELY THIS MODEL

02:23:11.616 --> 02:23:13.651
THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US IS NOT

02:23:13.718 --> 02:23:16.421
THE WAY TO GO. AND I URGE YOUR

02:23:16.487 --> 02:23:18.022
DEPARTMENT TAKE THE BLINDERS

02:23:18.089 --> 02:23:20.124
OFF, GIVE THE LEGISLATORS THE

02:23:20.191 --> 02:23:21.559
CLEAR ANSWERS THAT WE NEED, AND

02:23:21.626 --> 02:23:23.995
ONE OF THEM WILL BE TRANSITORY

02:23:24.062 --> 02:23:28.900
HOUSING AND A FIX TO SB 1034 TO

02:23:28.967 --> 02:23:30.134
CLARIFY THAT EXTRAORDINARY

02:23:30.201 --> 02:23:31.869
CIRCUMSTANCES ARE THE WHOLE DAMN

02:23:31.936 --> 02:23:33.371
THING IS EXTRAORDINARY. I THINK

02:23:33.438 --> 02:23:34.939
WE'VE MADE THE PUBLIC FINDINGS

02:23:35.006 --> 02:23:36.674
WE NEED TO MAKE IN ORDER TO

02:23:36.741 --> 02:23:38.876
ALLOW YOUR DEPARTMENT TO PLACE

02:23:38.943 --> 02:23:42.013
PEOPLE IN A SPECIFIC, FARAWAY

02:23:42.080 --> 02:23:43.915
LOCATION THAT THE STATE CAN

02:23:43.982 --> 02:23:45.783
MICROMANAGE DAY IN AND DAY OUT

02:23:45.850 --> 02:23:47.885
TO ENSURE PUBLIC SAFETY. THANK

02:23:47.952 --> 02:23:49.253
YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER, MAYO.

02:23:49.320 --> 02:23:51.723
ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO. THANK

02:23:51.789 --> 02:23:55.493
YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. HARD FOR

02:23:55.560 --> 02:23:57.195
LIBERTY HEALTH CARE. ARE YOU

02:23:57.261 --> 02:23:59.030
LOCATED? IS YOUR HEADQUARTERS

02:23:59.097 --> 02:24:01.799
PLACE IN FLORIDA? IT'S NOT WHERE

02:24:01.866 --> 02:24:03.735
THE CORPORATION IS BASED IN

02:24:03.801 --> 02:24:05.236
PENNSYLVANIA. PENNSYLVANIA? YES.

02:24:05.303 --> 02:24:06.771
STILL OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA. IT

02:24:06.838 --> 02:24:09.440
IS. YOUR PRESENCE HERE IS ON THE

02:24:09.507 --> 02:24:11.943
CASE MANAGEMENT OF THE SBP. IS

02:24:12.010 --> 02:24:13.444
THAT CORRECT? YOU HAVE A

02:24:13.511 --> 02:24:14.379
PRESENCE HERE IN THE STATE. WE

02:24:14.445 --> 02:24:17.015
HAVE A PRESENCE HERE IN THE

02:24:17.081 --> 02:24:18.716
STATE FOR, FOR SVP'S. WE ALSO

02:24:18.783 --> 02:24:19.584
HAVE OTHER CONTRACTS IN THE

02:24:19.650 --> 02:24:21.352
STATE. MY NEXT QUESTION WAS ON

02:24:21.419 --> 02:24:23.087
OTHER STATES AND THOSE OTHER

02:24:23.154 --> 02:24:25.056
STATES THAT YOU MANAGE THESE

02:24:25.123 --> 02:24:26.858
TYPE OF PROGRAMS, DO THEY HAVE

02:24:26.924 --> 02:24:30.428
THESE TRANSITORY HOUSING FOR

02:24:30.495 --> 02:24:35.400
SBP? IN THE OTHER STATE WHERE WE

02:24:35.466 --> 02:24:36.367
DO THE CONDITIONAL RELEASE

02:24:36.434 --> 02:24:37.969
PROGRAM, IT DOES NOT HAVE

02:24:38.036 --> 02:24:40.505
TRANSITIONAL HOUSING? NO. OKAY.

02:24:40.571 --> 02:24:42.206
WELL, I DO SHARE THE SAME

02:24:42.273 --> 02:24:43.875
CONCERNS THAT EVERYBODY VOICE

02:24:43.941 --> 02:24:46.344
HERE TODAY. DIFFERENT PARTS OF

02:24:46.411 --> 02:24:48.813
THE STATE, REGIONS BEING IN THE

02:24:48.880 --> 02:24:50.081
HIGH DESERT AGAIN, HAVING NOT

02:24:50.148 --> 02:24:52.250
ONE BUT THREE PLACEMENTS IS VERY

02:24:52.316 --> 02:24:55.219
CONCERNING. WHEN YOU WERE

02:24:55.286 --> 02:24:57.021
GRANTED THIS PROGRAM, WAS IT

02:24:57.088 --> 02:24:58.456
2003? I BELIEVE YOU SAID YES.

02:24:58.523 --> 02:25:02.527
SINCE 2003. AND MY UNDERSTANDING

02:25:02.593 --> 02:25:04.829
IS THAT YOU WERE GRANTED THIS

02:25:04.896 --> 02:25:06.631
PROGRAM BECAUSE YOU WERE THE

02:25:06.697 --> 02:25:08.933
ONLY RESPONDENT TO THE RFP,

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.002
CORRECT? OKAY. PART OF WHAT I

02:25:11.069 --> 02:25:12.837
WANTED TO DISCUSS, CONVERSATION

02:25:12.904 --> 02:25:15.406
STARTED WITH ME TRYING TO SEE IF

02:25:15.473 --> 02:25:16.007
THERE WERE OTHER VENDORS THAT

02:25:16.074 --> 02:25:18.142
WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THIS

02:25:18.209 --> 02:25:21.712
TYPE OF SERVICE FOR THE S¼ IN

02:25:21.779 --> 02:25:23.281
YOUR EXPERIENCE, DO YOU THINK

02:25:23.347 --> 02:25:24.248
THERE WOULD BE A DIFFICULT TIME

02:25:24.315 --> 02:25:25.716
FINDING SOMEBODY ELSE IF WE WERE

02:25:25.783 --> 02:25:27.819
TO OPEN THAT UP? YEAH, I'D

02:25:27.885 --> 02:25:29.253
ACTUALLY LIKE TO HAND THIS OVER

02:25:29.320 --> 02:25:30.021
TO CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR EVANS

02:25:30.088 --> 02:25:31.089
TO PROVIDE, BECAUSE SHE'S HAD

02:25:31.155 --> 02:25:32.123
CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER

02:25:32.190 --> 02:25:34.125
VENDORS. I WOULD NOTE THAT THE

02:25:34.192 --> 02:25:35.259
DEPARTMENT HAS SOLICITED

02:25:35.326 --> 02:25:36.661
MULTIPLE TIMES THROUGHOUT THE

02:25:36.727 --> 02:25:39.263
YEARS, AND THE MOST RECENT

02:25:39.330 --> 02:25:40.865
YEARS, TRIED TO SOLICIT FOR

02:25:40.932 --> 02:25:42.934
ADDITIONAL VENDORS, AND HAVE NOT

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.470
RECEIVED RESPONSES WITH RESPECT

02:25:45.536 --> 02:25:47.905
TO THE AUDIT ITSELF. AND THAT

02:25:47.972 --> 02:25:49.607
RECOMMENDATION FOR US TO DO AN

02:25:49.674 --> 02:25:53.478
ANALYSIS WITH RESPECT TO THE

02:25:53.544 --> 02:25:54.745
WOULD IT BE MORE COST EFFECTIVE

02:25:54.812 --> 02:25:55.947
FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE

02:25:56.013 --> 02:25:58.750
THE SERVICES OR OR, YOU KNOW,

02:25:58.816 --> 02:26:00.685
ANALYSIS OF WHETHER WE COULD

02:26:00.751 --> 02:26:04.522
KIND OF BID THE PROGRAM OUT

02:26:04.589 --> 02:26:05.590
DIFFERENTLY AND LOOK AT

02:26:05.656 --> 02:26:07.492
SEPARATING OUT SERVICES OR DOING

02:26:07.558 --> 02:26:09.927
REGIONAL SERVICES? WE DID, YOU

02:26:09.994 --> 02:26:11.729
KNOW, IN IN THINKING ABOUT IT

02:26:11.796 --> 02:26:12.630
FROM A REGIONAL PROGRAM, AS

02:26:12.697 --> 02:26:14.332
WE'VE NOTED, WE HAVE 21

02:26:14.398 --> 02:26:15.600
INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY.

02:26:15.666 --> 02:26:17.401
AND SO FROM AN ECONOMIES OF

02:26:17.468 --> 02:26:19.570
SCALE, KIND OF BREAKING THIS

02:26:19.637 --> 02:26:21.572
INTO SMALLER PIECES, IT BECOMES

02:26:21.639 --> 02:26:24.375
A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT, BUT

02:26:24.442 --> 02:26:26.911
IT ALSO BECOMES A CHALLENGE OF

02:26:26.978 --> 02:26:28.146
HAVING MULTIPLE VENDORS DOING

02:26:28.212 --> 02:26:30.615
THE ENTIRE PROGRAM AND TRYING TO

02:26:30.681 --> 02:26:33.084
KEEP ALL THE VENDORS COORDINATED

02:26:33.151 --> 02:26:35.786
AND, AND, AND KEEPING THE, THE

02:26:35.853 --> 02:26:38.422
PROGRAMS, SERVICES, AND, AND

02:26:38.489 --> 02:26:39.824
MEETING THE EXPECTATIONS WITH

02:26:39.891 --> 02:26:42.326
RESPECT TO THE PROGRAM. AND THEN

02:26:42.393 --> 02:26:43.761
BUT WHEN WE DID THE ANALYSIS, WE

02:26:43.828 --> 02:26:46.364
DID DETERMINE THAT WE DO THINK

02:26:46.430 --> 02:26:47.865
THAT YOU COULD PEEL UP PORTIONS

02:26:47.932 --> 02:26:50.835
OF THIS, RIGHT? SO THE TWO AREAS

02:26:50.902 --> 02:26:53.171
WE THOUGHT WE COULD SPLIT OUT

02:26:53.237 --> 02:26:56.474
WAS THE HOUSING SEARCH PROCESS.

02:26:56.541 --> 02:26:58.309
AND, AND TO CONTRACT WITH A

02:26:58.376 --> 02:26:59.777
VENDOR TO DO THE HOUSING SEARCH

02:26:59.844 --> 02:27:01.012
AND LET LIBERTY HEALTHCARE DO

02:27:01.078 --> 02:27:03.581
THE REST, AND ALSO IN THE

02:27:03.648 --> 02:27:04.415
ENHANCED SUPERVISION PIECE OF IT

02:27:04.482 --> 02:27:06.484
COULD POTENTIALLY BE SPLIT OUT.

02:27:06.551 --> 02:27:09.053
SO WE DID PROCEED WITH SOME

02:27:09.120 --> 02:27:11.923
SENDING OUT A REQUEST FOR

02:27:11.989 --> 02:27:13.624
INFORMATION TO VENDORS TO SEE IF

02:27:13.691 --> 02:27:14.825
WE COULD GAIN SOME INTEREST IN

02:27:14.892 --> 02:27:17.328
THOSE IN THOSE SERVICES, AND WE

02:27:17.395 --> 02:27:20.164
DID NOT RECEIVE ANY RESPONSE ON

02:27:20.231 --> 02:27:22.400
FROM ANY VENDORS ON THE ENHANCED

02:27:22.466 --> 02:27:23.501
SUPERVISION. WE DID RECEIVE ONE

02:27:23.568 --> 02:27:24.835
RESPONSE FOR THE PLACEMENT

02:27:24.902 --> 02:27:26.270
SERVICES, THE HOUSING SEARCH

02:27:26.337 --> 02:27:28.506
SERVICES, AND WE ARE IN THE

02:27:28.573 --> 02:27:30.208
PROCESS OF REVIEWING THAT

02:27:30.274 --> 02:27:32.343
PROPOSAL AND THE AND THE VENDOR

02:27:32.410 --> 02:27:35.046
ITSELF TO SEE IF THIS IS A

02:27:35.112 --> 02:27:37.181
VIABLE OPTION, TAKING INTO

02:27:37.248 --> 02:27:38.849
ACCOUNT THE COMMENTS FROM OTHER

02:27:38.916 --> 02:27:41.719
MEMBERS AND HEARING THAT MAKING

02:27:41.786 --> 02:27:43.187
IMPROVEMENTS TO THE PROGRAM IS

02:27:43.254 --> 02:27:44.622
SOMETHING THAT OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE

02:27:44.689 --> 02:27:47.491
WILLING TO DO. BREAKING UP THOSE

02:27:47.558 --> 02:27:48.893
SERVICES ENTIRELY THAT ARE BEING

02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:50.761
PROVIDED BY LIBERTY HEALTHCARE.

02:27:50.828 --> 02:27:52.363
DO YOU SEE THAT AS AN ADVANTAGE

02:27:52.430 --> 02:27:53.831
OF HAVING DIFFERENT SERVICES

02:27:53.898 --> 02:27:54.765
BEING PROVIDED, TO THE EXTENT

02:27:54.832 --> 02:27:56.300
THAT YOU JUST EXPLAINED THAT

02:27:56.367 --> 02:27:59.604
IT'LL STILL BE A DIFFICULTY

02:27:59.670 --> 02:28:00.204
GETTING RESPONDENTS? YEAH, I

02:28:00.271 --> 02:28:01.539
THINK WE'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE

02:28:01.606 --> 02:28:02.540
DIFFICULTY GETTING RESPONDENTS,

02:28:02.607 --> 02:28:04.742
AND I DO WANT TO HAND IT OVER TO

02:28:04.809 --> 02:28:06.444
MISS EVANS BECAUSE SHE HAS HAD

02:28:06.510 --> 02:28:07.311
CONVERSATIONS WITH VENDORS AND

02:28:07.378 --> 02:28:08.879
CAN SHARE WHAT SOME OF THE

02:28:08.946 --> 02:28:10.214
FEEDBACK HAS BEEN ABOUT WHY WE

02:28:10.281 --> 02:28:13.451
MAY NOT BE GETTING RESPONSES.

02:28:13.517 --> 02:28:15.453
YEAH, SURE. YOU KNOW, IN

02:28:15.519 --> 02:28:18.422
ADDITION TO WE HAVE ISSUED IN

02:28:18.489 --> 02:28:20.558
ADDITION TO WHAT THE DIRECTOR

02:28:20.625 --> 02:28:23.394
HAD JUST DESCRIBED, WE HAD

02:28:23.461 --> 02:28:24.662
ISSUED FOUR SOLICITATIONS IN THE

02:28:24.729 --> 02:28:29.267
LAST SEVERAL YEARS, 1 IN 2015, 2

02:28:29.333 --> 02:28:31.435
IN 2022 AND 1 IN 2023. AND WE

02:28:31.502 --> 02:28:34.405
DIDN'T RECEIVE ANY RESPONSES

02:28:34.472 --> 02:28:36.474
OTHER THAN FROM LIBERTY

02:28:36.540 --> 02:28:40.478
HEALTHCARE. WE HAVE ALSO

02:28:40.544 --> 02:28:42.246
ACTIVELY REACHED OUT TO

02:28:42.313 --> 02:28:43.714
PROSPECTIVE PROVIDERS. WE DO RUN

02:28:43.781 --> 02:28:45.783
OTHER PROGRAMS WITHIN THE

02:28:45.850 --> 02:28:47.251
DEPARTMENT, AND SOME OF THE

02:28:47.318 --> 02:28:48.753
PROVIDERS THAT WE DO WORK WITH

02:28:48.819 --> 02:28:51.889
HAVE EXPERIENCE IN TREATING AND

02:28:51.956 --> 02:28:53.724
SERVING INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE SEX

02:28:53.791 --> 02:28:56.260
OFFENSES IN THEIR HISTORY. WE

02:28:56.327 --> 02:28:59.263
HAVE ALSO REACHED OUT AND SHARED

02:28:59.330 --> 02:29:02.400
OUR SOLICITATIONS WITH NATIONAL

02:29:02.466 --> 02:29:03.367
ORGANIZATIONS FOR THE TREATMENT

02:29:03.434 --> 02:29:05.202
OF SEX OFFENDERS, JUST TO KIND

02:29:05.269 --> 02:29:07.171
OF GET THE WORD OUT AGAIN, WE

02:29:07.238 --> 02:29:08.839
HAVEN'T RECEIVED A LOT OF

02:29:08.906 --> 02:29:10.641
FEEDBACK OTHER THAN THE FEW

02:29:10.708 --> 02:29:12.009
VENDORS THAT WE HAVE CONNECTED

02:29:12.076 --> 02:29:17.048
WITH. REALLY BOILS DOWN TO THIS

02:29:17.114 --> 02:29:20.017
PROGRAM IN TERMS OF SIZE AND

02:29:20.084 --> 02:29:22.119
SCALE. IT IS AT THIS POINT VERY

02:29:22.186 --> 02:29:24.322
SMALL. AND SO FROM AN ECONOMY OF

02:29:24.388 --> 02:29:28.392
SCALE, IT IS DIFFICULT TO, TO

02:29:28.459 --> 02:29:32.163
MANAGE. KNOWING THAT, THAT THERE

02:29:32.229 --> 02:29:34.765
NEEDS TO BE SORT OF A NETWORK OF

02:29:34.832 --> 02:29:35.933
PROVIDERS ACROSS THE STATE. AND

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:37.735
THEN REALLY ALSO I THINK JUST

02:29:37.802 --> 02:29:40.905
THE SORT OF THE POLITICAL HIGH

02:29:40.971 --> 02:29:43.374
PROFILE NATURE OF THE PROGRAM

02:29:43.441 --> 02:29:45.543
THAT SORT OF DETERS SOME OF THE

02:29:45.609 --> 02:29:47.278
VENDORS FROM WANTING TO KIND OF

02:29:47.345 --> 02:29:49.513
STEP UP AND PARTICIPATE. AND I

02:29:49.580 --> 02:29:51.515
THINK I HEARD YOU SAY THAT FROM

02:29:51.582 --> 02:29:53.517
NOW ON, THERE'S GOING TO BE A

02:29:53.584 --> 02:29:56.253
REVIEW OR A ANOTHER AUDIT EVERY

02:29:56.320 --> 02:29:57.855
TWO YEARS. IS THAT IS THAT

02:29:57.922 --> 02:30:01.058
CORRECT? YES. WHAT WILL WILL

02:30:01.125 --> 02:30:03.060
PERFORM WILL BE PERFORMING. YES.

02:30:03.127 --> 02:30:05.029
WELL, AGAIN, I'M SURE YOU YOU

02:30:05.096 --> 02:30:06.464
KNOW, THE FRUSTRATION THAT WE

02:30:06.530 --> 02:30:08.232
HAVE, PARTICULARLY THOSE OF US

02:30:08.299 --> 02:30:10.468
THAT HAVE RURAL COMMUNITIES WITH

02:30:10.534 --> 02:30:11.802
REAL CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN

02:30:11.869 --> 02:30:13.938
EXPRESSED. I'M LOOKING FORWARD

02:30:14.004 --> 02:30:16.307
TO LEARNING MORE ABOUT SB 380,

02:30:16.374 --> 02:30:18.642
SEE HOW WE CAN WORK ON THAT, AND

02:30:18.709 --> 02:30:20.044
HOPEFULLY WE'LL CONTINUE THE

02:30:20.111 --> 02:30:21.145
CONVERSATION, BECAUSE IT'S

02:30:21.212 --> 02:30:22.747
SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY NEED TO

02:30:22.813 --> 02:30:24.415
FIGURE OUT. YEAH, YEAH. THANK

NEXT WE'LL GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT

02:30:30.254 --> 02:30:32.790
IF THERE'S ANYONE WHO'D LIKE TO

02:30:32.857 --> 02:30:35.760
ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE. I DON'T

02:30:35.826 --> 02:30:40.965
SEE ANYONE. I APPRECIATE. THERE

02:30:41.031 --> 02:30:42.566
WAS A LOT OF CONVERSATION HERE

02:30:42.633 --> 02:30:43.667
TODAY, AND I REALLY APPRECIATE

02:30:43.734 --> 02:30:46.404
