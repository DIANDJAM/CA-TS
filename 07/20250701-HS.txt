THE VERY PROGRAM WE'RE FIGHTING

00:50:54.384 --> 00:50:56.386
TO PROTECT. HEAD START. RAISED

00:50:56.453 --> 00:50:57.988
IN RURAL CALIFORNIA BY A SINGLE

00:50:58.054 --> 00:51:00.157
MOM WHO WORKED TWO JOBS JUST TO

00:51:00.223 --> 00:51:01.491
KEEP THE LIGHTS ON AND FOOD ON

00:51:01.558 --> 00:51:03.393
THE TABLE. I KNOW FIRSTHAND WHAT

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:04.828
HEAD START MEANS TO MY FAMILY'S

00:51:04.895 --> 00:51:06.196
LIKE MINE. IT WAS A LIFELINE.

00:51:06.263 --> 00:51:07.264
WHILE MY MOM WORKED TIRELESSLY

00:51:07.330 --> 00:51:09.099
TO BUILD A BETTER LIFE FOR US,

00:51:09.166 --> 00:51:10.767
HEAD START GAVE US A SAFE PLACE

00:51:10.834 --> 00:51:12.602
TO LEARN, GROW, AND BE SEEN. IT

00:51:12.669 --> 00:51:14.104
GAVE HER THE PEACE OF MIND THAT

00:51:14.171 --> 00:51:15.505
EVERY PARENT DESERVES, AND THAT

00:51:15.572 --> 00:51:17.174
HER CHILD WAS IN GOOD HANDS AND

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:18.809
LEARNING AND CARED FOR. THAT'S

00:51:18.875 --> 00:51:20.610
WHY THIS FIGHT IS PERSONAL FOR

00:51:20.677 --> 00:51:21.611
ME AND RURAL COUNTIES LIKE

MODOC, SISKIYOU AND LASSEN AND

00:51:23.046 --> 00:51:25.248
ANY OF MY 11 COUNTIES THAT I

00:51:25.315 --> 00:51:26.316
REPRESENT IN DISTRICT ONE. HEAD

00:51:26.383 --> 00:51:28.051
START ISN'T JUST ONE OPTION

00:51:28.118 --> 00:51:30.287
AMONG MANY, IT'S OFTEN THE ONLY

00:51:30.353 --> 00:51:32.122
OPTION. THE ONLY PLACE WHERE A

00:51:32.189 --> 00:51:33.890
CHILD CAN GET A MEAL, A HEALTH

00:51:33.957 --> 00:51:34.958
SCREENING, OR OFTEN THE ONLY

00:51:35.025 --> 00:51:36.426
LEARNING PROGRAM OR CHILD CARE

00:51:36.493 --> 00:51:37.194
OPTION AVAILABLE. THE ONLY WAY A

00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:39.229
PARENT CAN GO TO WORK WITHOUT

00:51:39.296 --> 00:51:40.664
HAVING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN A

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:41.865
PAYCHECK AND THEIR CHILD'S

00:51:41.932 --> 00:51:43.200
SAFETY. THIS IS NOT A PARTIZAN

00:51:43.266 --> 00:51:45.035
ISSUE. THIS IS A VALUES ISSUE, A

00:51:45.101 --> 00:51:46.269
COMMUNITY ISSUE, AND A FUTURE OF

00:51:46.336 --> 00:51:48.305
OUR KIDS ISSUE. AND IF ANYONE

00:51:48.371 --> 00:51:49.573
DOUBTS THE POWER OF HEAD START,

00:51:49.639 --> 00:51:51.975
I INVITE THEM TO LOOK AT ME. I'M

00:51:52.042 --> 00:51:53.310
A PROUD PRODUCT OF THIS PROGRAM.

00:51:53.376 --> 00:51:54.678
IT WASN'T JUST HEAD START THAT

00:51:54.744 --> 00:51:56.780
HELPED MY FAMILY AND I, BUT

00:51:56.847 --> 00:51:58.048
LATCHKEY FOOD STAMPS, COMMODITY

00:51:58.114 --> 00:51:59.616
PROGRAMS, LOW INCOME HOUSING,

00:51:59.683 --> 00:52:01.251

00:52:03.587 --> 00:52:05.622
DARE, BIG BROTHER, BIG SISTERS.

00:52:05.689 --> 00:52:07.424
I'M SURE THERE ARE MORE, BUT ALL

00:52:07.491 --> 00:52:09.259
OF THESE PROGRAMS INVEST IN OUR

00:52:09.326 --> 00:52:10.560
FAMILIES. THEY INVEST IN OUR

00:52:10.627 --> 00:52:12.529
CHILDREN. MY MOM WAS ABLE TO USE

00:52:12.596 --> 00:52:13.964
WHAT SHE NEEDED AND WORK HARD TO

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:16.066
MAKE A BETTER LIFE. IT WAS A

00:52:16.132 --> 00:52:16.900
STEPPING STONE. WE NEED THESE

00:52:16.967 --> 00:52:19.069
STEPPING STONES FOR OUR FAMILIES

00:52:19.135 --> 00:52:20.770
SO THAT WHEN THEY FACE THOSE

00:52:20.837 --> 00:52:22.205
CHALLENGING FINANCIAL TIMES THAT

00:52:22.272 --> 00:52:23.807
OUR OUR NEXT GENERATIONS ARE

00:52:23.874 --> 00:52:25.542
TAKEN CARE OF, I FULLY BELIEVE

00:52:25.609 --> 00:52:27.143
THAT WE NEED TO CUT OUR BUDGET

00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:28.979
AND CUT THE WASTE. I JUST HOPE

00:52:29.045 --> 00:52:30.514
THAT WE DON'T DO THAT ON THE

00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:32.415
BACKS OF OUR LOW INCOME WORKING

00:52:32.482 --> 00:52:33.149
FAMILIES AND OUR CHILDREN. I'M

00:52:33.216 --> 00:52:34.651
HERE TODAY BECAUSE SOMEONE

00:52:34.718 --> 00:52:36.353
INVESTED IN MY FUTURE AND WHEN I

00:52:36.419 --> 00:52:37.954
WAS A LITTLE GIRL, THEY THEY

00:52:38.021 --> 00:52:40.290
TOOK THE TIME TO CARE. WE NEED

00:52:40.357 --> 00:52:41.091
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP DOING

00:52:41.157 --> 00:52:43.326
THAT FOR THE NEXT CHILD, THE

00:52:43.393 --> 00:52:44.160
NEXT SINGLE MOM, THE NEXT HEAD

00:52:44.227 --> 00:52:45.795

00:52:45.862 --> 00:52:48.031
NOWHERE ELSE TO GO. SO NOW IS

00:52:48.098 --> 00:52:49.165
THE TIME THAT WE LEAD WITH

00:52:49.232 --> 00:52:51.301
PURPOSE, TO PUT FAMILIES FIRST

00:52:51.368 --> 00:52:52.269

00:52:52.335 --> 00:52:52.869
AND TO INVEST IN THE PROMISE

00:52:52.936 --> 00:52:54.504

01:01:46.669 --> 01:01:47.970
SHARED, ARE, YOU KNOW, HAVE

01:01:48.037 --> 01:01:49.605
EXTREMELY LOW INCOMES AT THIS

01:01:49.672 --> 01:01:51.307
AGE. AND THIS DOESN'T AFFECT

01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:52.742
THEIR ELIGIBILITY FOR PUBLIC

01:01:52.809 --> 01:01:55.578
BENEFITS OR FINANCIAL AID. IN

01:01:55.645 --> 01:01:57.847
2024, NEARLY 5700 YOUTH RECEIVED

01:01:57.914 --> 01:02:00.516
THE CREDIT, TOTALING $6.1

01:02:00.583 --> 01:02:02.852
MILLION. BUT THAT'S JUST 16% OF

01:02:02.919 --> 01:02:05.688
WHO'S ELIGIBLE. SO WE PILOTED

01:02:05.755 --> 01:02:08.091
THE MAILING STRATEGY IN THE BILL

01:02:08.157 --> 01:02:10.326
IN FOUR COUNTIES. THREE OF THOSE

01:02:10.393 --> 01:02:11.260
COUNTIES SAW THE HIGHEST

01:02:11.327 --> 01:02:12.929
INCREASE IN UPTAKE STATEWIDE

01:02:12.995 --> 01:02:14.363
WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER SIMILARLY

01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:15.765
SIZED COUNTIES, AND THE FOURTH

01:02:15.832 --> 01:02:17.300
HAD THE SECOND HIGHEST. THIS

01:02:17.366 --> 01:02:18.634
SHOWS WHAT'S POSSIBLE WITH

01:02:18.701 --> 01:02:20.236
CONSISTENT OUTREACH, BUT

01:02:20.303 --> 01:02:21.938
CURRENTLY NO SUCH OUTREACH IS

01:02:22.004 --> 01:02:23.372
REQUIRED, SO WITHOUT IT, YOUTH

01:02:23.439 --> 01:02:24.874
ARE LEAVING MONEY ON THE TABLE

01:02:24.941 --> 01:02:27.443
AND AT A TIME WHEN THEY REALLY

01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:28.311
NEED IT. SO WE RESPECTFULLY ASK

01:02:28.377 --> 01:02:30.246
FOR YOUR VOTE ON SB 624 TO

01:02:30.313 --> 01:02:31.948
CONNECT MORE FOSTER YOUTH WITH

01:02:32.014 --> 01:02:33.316
THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED AND

01:02:33.382 --> 01:02:37.053
DESERVE. GOOD AFTERNOON, CHAIR

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.454
AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY

01:02:38.521 --> 01:02:40.623
NAME IS BAILEY CRAIG. I AM 23

01:02:40.690 --> 01:02:42.125
YEARS OLD. I GRADUATED FROM

01:02:42.191 --> 01:02:43.493
SACRAMENTO STATE THIS YEAR AND

01:02:43.559 --> 01:02:45.294
WILL BE RETURNING FOR A MASTER'S

01:02:45.361 --> 01:02:47.096
IN SOCIAL WORK THIS FALL. I'M A

01:02:47.163 --> 01:02:48.131
FORMER FOSTER YOUTH FROM THE

01:02:48.197 --> 01:02:49.899
NAPA COUNTY. I ENTERED THE

01:02:49.966 --> 01:02:52.001
SYSTEM AT SEVEN YEARS OLD AND

01:02:52.068 --> 01:02:54.003
REMAINED IN THE SYSTEM UNTIL I

01:02:54.070 --> 01:02:55.671
BECAME AN ADULT. I'M CURRENTLY A

01:02:55.738 --> 01:02:57.140
YOUTH ADVOCATE AT JOHN BURTON'S

01:02:57.206 --> 01:02:59.108
ADVOCATES FOR YOUTH, AND I'M

01:02:59.175 --> 01:03:00.376
HERE TO SHARE MY EXPERIENCE WITH

01:03:00.443 --> 01:03:02.245
RECEIVING THE FOSTER YOUTH TAX

01:03:02.311 --> 01:03:03.513
CREDIT. I WAS APPROACHED BY

01:03:03.579 --> 01:03:05.248
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION

01:03:05.314 --> 01:03:07.350
CALLED VOICES TO FILE MY TAXES.

01:03:07.416 --> 01:03:09.619
AT THE TIME, VOICES WAS THE ONLY

01:03:09.685 --> 01:03:10.319
YOUTH SERVING ORGANIZATION

01:03:10.386 --> 01:03:11.988
RUNNING A VOLUNTEER INCOME TAX

01:03:12.054 --> 01:03:13.389
ASSISTANCE SITE. THEY FIRST

01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:14.891
APPROACHED ME WHEN I TURNED 18,

01:03:14.957 --> 01:03:16.292
BUT I WASN'T INTERESTED BECAUSE

01:03:16.359 --> 01:03:17.960
I HEARD STORIES ABOUT HAVING TO

01:03:18.027 --> 01:03:20.029
PAY MONEY WHEN YOU FILE YOUR

01:03:20.096 --> 01:03:21.230
TAXES. THEY ASKED ME. THEY ASKED

01:03:21.297 --> 01:03:23.466
ME EACH YEAR AFTER THAT AND I

01:03:23.533 --> 01:03:24.200
WOULD POLITELY DECLINE. IT

01:03:24.267 --> 01:03:26.702
WASN'T UNTIL 2023 WHEN I TURNED

01:03:26.769 --> 01:03:28.604
20 THAT THEY CAUGHT MY EAR. YOU

01:03:28.671 --> 01:03:30.706
SEE, 2023 WAS THE FIRST YEAR THE

01:03:30.773 --> 01:03:32.508
FOSTER YOUTH TAX CREDIT BECAME

01:03:32.575 --> 01:03:33.376
AVAILABLE. THEY TOLD ME ABOUT

01:03:33.442 --> 01:03:35.845
IT, AND IT SOUNDED LIKE I WAS

01:03:35.912 --> 01:03:37.914
LIKELY TO GET MONEY BACK IF I

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:38.814
FILED MY TAXES THAT YEAR. I GOT

01:03:38.881 --> 01:03:40.783
MY REFUND AND I FILED EACH OF

01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:42.718
THE TWO FOLLOWING YEARS. THIS

01:03:42.785 --> 01:03:45.188
YEAR I GOT $1,400 BECAUSE NOT

01:03:45.254 --> 01:03:46.422
ONLY DID I QUALIFY FOR THE

01:03:46.489 --> 01:03:48.257
FOSTER YOUTH TAX CREDIT, BUT

01:03:48.324 --> 01:03:49.859
ALSO FOR THE CALIFORNIA EARNED

01:03:49.926 --> 01:03:51.661
INCOME TAX CREDIT. THIS MONEY

01:03:51.727 --> 01:03:53.996
MAY NOT SEEM LIKE A LOT TO SOME

01:03:54.063 --> 01:03:55.364
PEOPLE, BUT FOR ME, IT HELPED ME

01:03:55.431 --> 01:03:56.866
PAY MY CAR INSURANCE,

01:03:56.933 --> 01:03:58.067
REGISTRATION, AND DEBT THAT I

01:03:58.134 --> 01:03:59.202
HAD ACCRUED. THE MONEY RECEIVED

01:03:59.268 --> 01:04:00.670
FROM MY TAX RETURN HELPED ME

01:04:00.736 --> 01:04:03.172
MAINTAIN MY CAR, MY CAR FOR

01:04:03.239 --> 01:04:04.006
TRANSPORTATION, WHICH WAS

01:04:04.073 --> 01:04:05.975
CRUCIAL. MY FOSTER DAD AT THIS

01:04:06.042 --> 01:04:07.677
TIME WAS UNABLE TO DRIVE. THIS

01:04:07.743 --> 01:04:09.111
WAS BECAUSE HE HAD A MAJOR

01:04:09.178 --> 01:04:11.380
STROKE THAT LEFT HIM PARTIALLY

01:04:11.447 --> 01:04:13.583
PARALYZED. HAVING A CAR FOR

01:04:13.649 --> 01:04:14.717
TRANSPORTATION WAS IMPORTANT

01:04:14.784 --> 01:04:16.619
BECAUSE IT GAVE ME INDEPENDENCE.

01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:17.787
IT ALLOWED ME TO PROVIDE MYSELF

01:04:17.853 --> 01:04:19.288
WITH TRANSPORTATION. I NEEDED TO

01:04:19.355 --> 01:04:21.691
GET TO SCHOOL AND WORK. I COULD

01:04:21.757 --> 01:04:23.926
ALSO DRIVE MY FOSTER DAD TO HIS

01:04:23.993 --> 01:04:25.461
DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENTS. FOR A LOT

01:04:25.528 --> 01:04:27.230
OF PEOPLE MY AGE, RECEIVING THIS

01:04:27.296 --> 01:04:29.131
CREDIT MEANS BEING ABLE TO PAY

01:04:29.198 --> 01:04:30.566
ANOTHER MONTH OF RENT. IT REALLY

01:04:30.633 --> 01:04:31.867
IS A LIFELINE, AND IT'S

01:04:31.934 --> 01:04:33.002
UNFORTUNATE THAT SO MANY OF MY

01:04:33.069 --> 01:04:34.870
PEERS ARE UNAWARE ABOUT IT. I'M

01:04:34.937 --> 01:04:37.340
IN SUPPORT OF SB 624 BECAUSE OF

01:04:37.406 --> 01:04:39.342
FOSTER YOUTH TAX CREDIT IS AN

01:04:39.408 --> 01:04:40.476
IMPORTANT RESOURCE IN THIS BILL.

01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:42.278

01:04:42.345 --> 01:04:44.113
TO IMPROVE AWARENESS AND ACCESS

01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:46.749
TO IT. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. TWO

ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM

01:06:42.064 --> 01:06:44.233
THE EYES, SENATOR AL-HAWARI, I

JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR SO

01:06:46.502 --> 01:06:48.904
MUCH FOR THIS INCREDIBLE BILL. I

01:06:48.971 --> 01:06:50.506
THINK IN PARTICULAR FOR HAVING

01:06:50.573 --> 01:06:52.174
THE VISION TO ESTABLISH THE

01:06:52.241 --> 01:06:54.110
FOSTER YOUTH TAX CREDIT IN THE

01:06:54.176 --> 01:06:55.311
FIRST PLACE AND TO CONTINUE TO

ENSURE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE

01:06:57.279 --> 01:06:59.081
ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS

01:06:59.148 --> 01:07:01.283
TAX CREDIT. I'M A FOSTER MOM TO

01:07:01.350 --> 01:07:03.052
A YOUNG WOMAN WHO'S NOW 23, AND

01:07:03.119 --> 01:07:05.154
JUST KNOWING THAT SHE HAS ACCESS

01:07:05.221 --> 01:07:07.123
TO THIS, I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF

01:07:07.189 --> 01:07:09.058
SHE KNOWS. AND SO IT'S REALLY, I

01:07:09.125 --> 01:07:10.593
THINK, IMPORTANT THAT YOU DO THE

01:07:12.161 --> 01:07:13.362
THE YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE A SENSE OF

01:07:13.429 --> 01:07:14.797
IT, AND BEING REALLY THOUGHTFUL

01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:16.499
ABOUT ENSURING THAT YOUNG PEOPLE

01:07:16.565 --> 01:07:18.334
CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS MEANS

01:07:18.401 --> 01:07:19.435
SO THAT THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE

01:07:19.502 --> 01:07:21.404
THEY'RE JUST PAYING MONEY TO

01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:22.471
TAXES, BUT THAT THEY CAN

01:07:22.538 --> 01:07:23.572
POTENTIALLY GET SOME BACK MEANS

01:07:23.639 --> 01:07:25.408
A LOT. SO THANK YOU TO THE

OKAY. GO AHEAD. I JUST WANTED TO

01:07:36.685 --> 01:07:39.054
HAVE WORKED WITH FOSTER YOUTH AS

01:07:45.161 --> 01:07:46.929
THE NEED AND IF THEY ARE AWARE

01:07:46.996 --> 01:07:49.098
OF IT, IT WOULD HELP THEM A LOT

01:07:49.165 --> 01:07:50.166

01:07:50.232 --> 01:07:52.234

DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AS

EBT CARD, IF THEY ARE ELIGIBLE

01:28:42.216 --> 01:28:43.918
FOR THE REGULAR CALFRESH. THIS

01:28:43.985 --> 01:28:45.486
IS A VITAL LIFELINE TO FAMILIES

01:28:45.553 --> 01:28:47.221
WHO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COVER

01:28:47.288 --> 01:28:48.923

THIS CRITICAL NEED, VICTIMS ARE

01:28:55.730 --> 01:28:56.431
IMMEDIATELY FOCUSED ON GETTING

THE ESSENTIALS OF SHELTER, FOOD,

NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS CAN STEP

01:29:01.803 --> 01:29:04.405

THEIR BENEFITS COULD BE DAMAGED

01:29:23.825 --> 01:29:26.728
OR UNAVAILABLE TO BE ACCESSED,

01:29:26.794 --> 01:29:28.062

DISPLACED OR RESPONDING TO THAT

01:29:29.363 --> 01:29:31.733
DIRECT EMERGENCY SITUATION. SO

01:29:31.799 --> 01:29:34.402
SB 739 WOULD ENSURE THAT CDSS IS

01:29:34.469 --> 01:29:36.437
AUTHORIZED TO INQUIRE WHETHER A

01:29:36.504 --> 01:29:37.905

TIMELY AND ADEQUATE SERVICES TO

01:29:41.609 --> 01:29:43.344
CALFRESH RECIPIENTS. THIS WOULD

01:29:43.411 --> 01:29:45.480
ALLOW CDSS TO WORK WITH IMPACTED

01:29:45.546 --> 01:29:46.447
COUNTIES SHOULD THERE BE

01:29:46.514 --> 01:29:48.683
POTENTIAL DIFFICULTIES FACED BY

01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:50.118
COUNTY WORKERS IN PROVIDING

01:29:50.184 --> 01:29:51.886
TIMELY SERVICE TO DISASTER

01:29:51.953 --> 01:29:53.387

01:29:55.957 --> 01:29:57.425
A TIME OF GREAT NEED? AND THIS

01:29:57.492 --> 01:30:00.661
REALLY WAS INSPIRED BY THE

01:30:00.728 --> 01:30:01.996
RECENT SITUATION WE'VE HAD IN

01:30:02.063 --> 01:30:04.098
LOS ANGELES COUNTY, AND MAKING
