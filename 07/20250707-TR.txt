THE CITY. FOR OVER A DECADE,

00:59:16.719 --> 00:59:17.987
FRESNO HAS BEEN PLANNING AROUND

00:59:18.054 --> 00:59:20.189

TIMELY AND STRATEGIC. THIS WILL

00:59:38.775 --> 00:59:40.677
BE A TOOL TO EQUIP US WITH THE

01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:23.039
GOOD FOR US TO GATHER THAT

01:02:23.106 --> 01:02:24.240

01:02:24.307 --> 01:02:25.441

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:31.981
THAT OUT. AND THEN I ACTUALLY

01:02:32.048 --> 01:02:33.483
WOULD WONDER, ONCE WE HAVE THAT

01:02:33.549 --> 01:02:34.817
STUDY IN PLACE, WHETHER THERE'S

01:02:34.884 --> 01:02:36.018
FURTHER WORK THAT THE

HELP FUND AND BUILD OUT THAT

01:02:48.764 --> 01:02:50.766
THAT TRAIN. SO WE'D BE HAPPY TO

01:02:50.833 --> 01:02:52.835
WORK WITH YOU ON THAT IN THE

01:02:52.902 --> 01:02:55.738
FUTURE. THANK YOU. SEEING NO

01:02:55.805 --> 01:02:57.940

01:03:02.278 --> 01:03:04.046

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:08.084

01:07:13.529 --> 01:07:17.333
WITH THE COMMITTEE COLLEAGUES.

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:19.301
THE FOR THOSE FROM THE BAY AREA

01:07:19.368 --> 01:07:20.836
OR WHO HAVE VISITED THE BAY

01:07:20.903 --> 01:07:22.838
AREA, YOU'LL KNOW THAT PUBLIC

01:07:22.905 --> 01:07:24.006
TRANSPORTATION IS PART OF OUR

01:07:24.073 --> 01:07:26.542
REGION'S LIFEBLOOD. THE BAY AREA

01:07:26.609 --> 01:07:28.277
WOULD NOT BE THE BAY AREA

01:07:28.344 --> 01:07:31.080
WITHOUT PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION,

01:07:31.147 --> 01:07:33.048
AND WE KNOW THAT SO MANY PEOPLE

01:07:33.115 --> 01:07:35.284
IN THE BAY AREA, HOW THEY GET TO

01:07:35.351 --> 01:07:36.819
WORK, IT'S HOW THEY GET TO

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:39.755
SCHOOL, IT'S HOW THEY GET TO THE

01:07:39.822 --> 01:07:40.923
SUPERMARKET. AND WITHOUT

01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:42.992
TRANSIT, SO MANY PEOPLE WOULD BE

01:07:43.058 --> 01:07:44.960
SIMPLY STRANDED. PEOPLE WHO

01:07:45.027 --> 01:07:47.997
CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE A CAR. SOME

01:07:48.063 --> 01:07:49.432
PEOPLE WOULD JUST HAVE A LOWER

01:07:49.498 --> 01:07:52.401
QUALITY OF LIFE BY BEING FORCED

01:07:52.468 --> 01:07:54.136
TO DRIVE EVERYWHERE. AND EVEN

01:07:54.203 --> 01:07:55.304
FOR THE MANY PEOPLE WHO DON'T

01:07:55.371 --> 01:07:56.872
TAKE TRANSIT, THEIR LIFE WOULD

01:07:56.939 --> 01:07:58.808
BE WORSE BECAUSE TRAFFIC

01:07:58.874 --> 01:08:01.143
CONGESTION WOULD BE DRAMATICALLY

01:08:01.210 --> 01:08:02.645
WORSE. AND WE SEE THAT WHENEVER

01:08:02.711 --> 01:08:04.013
BART HAS AN ISSUE, EVEN IF FOR

01:08:04.079 --> 01:08:07.516
JUST A FEW HOURS, IT GRIDLOCKS

01:08:07.583 --> 01:08:12.588
OUR MAJOR FREEWAYS. SO WE CANNOT

01:08:12.655 --> 01:08:14.957
ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN. AND

01:08:15.024 --> 01:08:17.059
UNFORTUNATELY, IF NOTHING

01:08:17.126 --> 01:08:19.528
HAPPENS, IF WE DO NOTHING, WE

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:21.430
WILL HAVE UNRAVELING TRANSIT

01:08:21.497 --> 01:08:22.832
SYSTEMS. BART WILL ESSENTIALLY

01:08:22.898 --> 01:08:24.700
COLLAPSE. MUNI WILL REDUCE

01:08:24.767 --> 01:08:27.636
SERVICE BY AS MUCH AS 50%.

01:08:27.703 --> 01:08:29.138
CALTRAIN AC TRANSIT WILL. IT'LL

01:08:29.205 --> 01:08:31.407
JUST BE ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING

01:08:31.474 --> 01:08:33.876
FOR OUR REGION'S ECONOMY, FOR

01:08:33.943 --> 01:08:35.911
CONGESTION, FOR QUALITY OF LIFE.

01:08:35.978 --> 01:08:37.279
THIS HAS BEEN AN ISSUE FOR A

01:08:37.346 --> 01:08:40.249
LONG TIME IN TERMS OF STRUCTURAL

01:08:40.316 --> 01:08:41.984
OPERATING CHALLENGES FOR OUR

01:08:42.051 --> 01:08:43.452
TRANSIT SYSTEMS. AND THE BAY

01:08:43.519 --> 01:08:45.321
AREA HAS KICKED THE CAN DOWN THE

01:08:45.387 --> 01:08:47.189
ROAD FOR A LONG TIME. IT DID NOT

01:08:47.256 --> 01:08:49.058
START WITH THE PANDEMIC, BUT THE

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:50.626
PANDEMIC MADE IT WORSE AND

01:08:50.693 --> 01:08:52.061
EXPOSED IT. AND EVEN THOUGH MUNI

01:08:52.127 --> 01:08:54.230
IS NOW BACK UP TO 80% OF

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:56.632
PRE-PANDEMIC RIDERSHIP, CALTRAIN

01:08:56.699 --> 01:09:00.469
IS AT 70%. BART CONTINUES TO

01:09:00.536 --> 01:09:03.706
STRUGGLE AT ABOUT 45%. THIS IS A

01:09:03.772 --> 01:09:05.341
VERY, VERY REAL PROBLEM. AND SO

01:09:05.407 --> 01:09:06.909
IT'S TIME FOR THE BAY AREA.

01:09:06.976 --> 01:09:08.210
WE'VE WE'VE DONE THE WORK THAT

01:09:08.277 --> 01:09:10.779
WE CAN DO IN THE BUDGET. AND I'M

01:09:10.846 --> 01:09:13.048
PROUD AND HAPPY TO DO THAT WORK.

01:09:13.115 --> 01:09:14.416
AND I APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR

01:09:14.483 --> 01:09:15.751
COLLEAGUES SUPPORT. BUT WE'RE

01:09:15.818 --> 01:09:17.686
NOW AT A POINT WHERE THE BAY

01:09:17.753 --> 01:09:19.255
AREA NEEDS TO ENGAGE IN

01:09:19.321 --> 01:09:22.324
SELF-HELP, AND SB 63 WILL

01:09:22.391 --> 01:09:24.960
AUTHORIZE A REGIONAL REVENUE

01:09:25.027 --> 01:09:27.429
MEASURE TO SUPPORT TRANSIT

01:09:27.496 --> 01:09:29.965
OPERATIONS. IT'LL BE EITHER

01:09:30.032 --> 01:09:31.634
RIGHT NOW, IT'S STRUCTURED AS A

01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:33.135
THREE COUNTY MEASURE FOR CONTRA

01:09:33.202 --> 01:09:34.937
COSTA, ALAMEDA AND SAN FRANCISCO

01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:36.805
COUNTIES. WE ARE IN ACTIVE

01:09:36.872 --> 01:09:38.173
CONVERSATIONS WITH SAN MATEO AND

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:40.075
SANTA CLARA COUNTIES ABOUT THE

01:09:40.142 --> 01:09:42.111
POSSIBILITY OF BEING INCLUDED,

01:09:42.177 --> 01:09:44.079
AND IT'S STRUCTURED AS A 10 TO

01:09:44.146 --> 01:09:46.982
15 YEAR SALES TAX FOR TRANSIT

01:09:47.049 --> 01:09:49.018
OPERATIONS. SO I RESPECTFULLY

01:09:49.084 --> 01:09:51.987
ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. AND WITH ME

01:09:52.054 --> 01:09:53.355
TODAY TO TESTIFY IS JULIE

01:09:53.422 --> 01:09:55.357
KIRSCHBAUM, WHO IS THE DIRECTOR

01:09:55.424 --> 01:09:56.959

01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:59.428
FRANCISCO. AND THEN ALSO EMILY

01:09:59.495 --> 01:10:02.698
LOPER, THE VICE PRESIDENT OF

01:10:02.765 --> 01:10:03.699

01:10:03.766 --> 01:10:13.475
BAY AREA COUNCIL. GOOD

01:10:13.542 --> 01:10:14.910
AFTERNOON, CHAIR WILSON AND

01:10:14.977 --> 01:10:16.679
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I'M

01:10:16.745 --> 01:10:18.113
JULIE KIRSCHBAUM. I AM THE

01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:19.648
DIRECTOR OF THE SAN FRANCISCO

01:10:19.715 --> 01:10:22.217
MUNICIPAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCY.

01:10:22.284 --> 01:10:23.085
I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF

01:10:23.152 --> 01:10:27.957
WORKING AT THE SFMTA SINCE 2007,

01:10:28.023 --> 01:10:29.291
INCLUDING THE LAST SIX YEARS AS

01:10:29.358 --> 01:10:32.528
THE TRANSIT DIRECTOR. I BEGAN MY

01:10:32.595 --> 01:10:34.964
CURRENT ROLE EARLIER THIS YEAR

01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:37.266
AND NOW HAVE A SLIGHTLY BROADER

01:10:37.333 --> 01:10:40.803
SCOPE, INCLUDING BICYCLES,

01:10:40.869 --> 01:10:44.373
PEDESTRIANS, TAXIS, AS WELL AS

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:46.475
OTHER ROADWAY SAFETY. I'M HERE

01:10:46.542 --> 01:10:48.944
TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF

01:10:49.011 --> 01:10:51.280
SB 63, AND TO CONVEY TO YOU THE

01:10:51.347 --> 01:10:53.849
DIRE SITUATION THAT BAY AREA

01:10:53.916 --> 01:10:55.718
TRANSIT AGENCIES ARE IN, THAT

01:10:55.784 --> 01:10:58.253
THIS LEGISLATION WILL HELP TO

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:00.122
ALLEVIATE. MUNI HAS THE LARGEST

01:11:00.189 --> 01:11:03.192
DAILY RIDERSHIP OF ANY TRANSIT

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:05.060
AGENCY IN THE BAY AREA, AND THE

01:11:05.127 --> 01:11:07.529
EIGHTH HIGHEST IN THE NATION.

01:11:07.596 --> 01:11:09.231
AND EVEN THOUGH MUNI IS SAN

01:11:09.298 --> 01:11:11.667
FRANCISCO BASED, IT CARRIES OVER

01:11:11.734 --> 01:11:13.535
HALF OF ALL BAY AREA TRANSIT

01:11:13.602 --> 01:11:15.104
RIDERS AND ALMOST HALF OF THE

01:11:15.170 --> 01:11:18.474
BAY AREA. INTERAGENCY TRANSFERS

01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:21.043
INCLUDE. MUNI TRIP MUNI IS A

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:23.412
TOOL USED BY MANY BAY AREA

01:11:23.479 --> 01:11:24.246
WORKERS, AND SERVES AS A

01:11:24.313 --> 01:11:26.782
CRITICAL LIFELINE FOR SENIORS,

01:11:26.849 --> 01:11:28.450
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, AND

01:11:28.517 --> 01:11:30.352
PEOPLE WITH LOW INCOMES. THE

01:11:30.419 --> 01:11:32.321
WORK THAT HAS BEEN PUT INTO MUNI

01:11:32.388 --> 01:11:35.491
WE'RE VERY PROUD OF IT IS FAST,

01:11:35.557 --> 01:11:37.726
FREQUENT, RELIABLE, CLEAN AND

01:11:37.793 --> 01:11:40.529
SAFE, AND THAT IS CONTRIBUTING

01:11:40.596 --> 01:11:42.831
TO OUR HIGHEST CUSTOMER RATINGS

01:11:42.898 --> 01:11:45.634
IN ALMOST TWO DECADES. THERE ARE

01:11:45.701 --> 01:11:47.870
ABOUT A DOZEN MUNI ROUTES WHOSE

01:11:47.936 --> 01:11:49.338
RIDERSHIP IS HIGHER THAN IT WAS

01:11:49.405 --> 01:11:51.373
BEFORE THE PANDEMIC, AND WE ARE

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:53.108
SEEING STEADY, SYSTEM WIDE

01:11:53.175 --> 01:11:56.378
RIDERSHIP RECOVERY. WITH MAY

01:11:56.445 --> 01:11:58.981
2025 BEING OUR HIGHEST MONTH ON

01:11:59.048 --> 01:12:01.350
RECORD SINCE COVID. A WELL

01:12:01.417 --> 01:12:02.918
FUNCTIONING TRANSIT SYSTEM IS

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:04.253
CRITICAL TO THE ECONOMIC

01:12:04.319 --> 01:12:06.088
RECOVERY OF THE ENTIRE BAY AREA,

01:12:06.155 --> 01:12:08.057
AND THAT RECOVERY IS IN

01:12:08.123 --> 01:12:10.125
JEOPARDY. THE FISCAL CLIFF THAT

01:12:10.192 --> 01:12:12.127
THE BAY AREA TRANSIT AGENCIES

01:12:12.194 --> 01:12:13.796
HAVE BEEN WARNING ABOUT IS JUST

01:12:13.862 --> 01:12:15.564
AROUND THE CORNER. IN THE SUMMER

01:12:15.631 --> 01:12:18.467
OF 2026, THE STATE AND FEDERAL

01:12:18.534 --> 01:12:19.702
PANDEMIC RELIEF FUNDING THAT HAS

01:12:19.768 --> 01:12:21.637
BRIDGED THE SHORTFALL FOR OUR

01:12:21.704 --> 01:12:24.339
AGENCY WILL RUN OUT, AND WE WILL

01:12:24.406 --> 01:12:27.242
FACE A $322 MILLION ANNUAL

01:12:27.309 --> 01:12:28.877
DEFICIT, AND WE'LL HAVE TO HAVE

01:12:28.944 --> 01:12:33.382
YOU WRAP UP. THE SFMTA HAS

01:12:33.449 --> 01:12:36.385
WORKED HARD FOR SELF-HELP TO

01:12:36.452 --> 01:12:40.355
BOTH GENERATE NEW REVENUE AND

01:12:40.422 --> 01:12:42.157
DECREASE EXPENDITURE

01:12:42.224 --> 01:12:44.059
SIGNIFICANTLY. BUT WITHOUT THIS

01:12:44.126 --> 01:12:45.828
BILL, WE WILL BE FORCED TO MAKE

01:12:45.894 --> 01:12:47.396
DEVASTATING CUTS. SO WE DO URGE

01:12:47.463 --> 01:12:51.033
YOU TO APPROVE AND WE APPRECIATE

01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:53.736
YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

01:12:53.802 --> 01:12:54.803
GOOD AFTERNOON, CHAIR WILSON AND

01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:56.138
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. EMILY

01:12:56.205 --> 01:12:58.440
LOPER WITH BAY AREA COUNCIL. SO

01:12:58.507 --> 01:13:00.109
THE BAY AREA COUNCIL IS PROUD TO

01:13:00.175 --> 01:13:02.044
HAVE LED THE ADVOCACY TO CREATE

01:13:02.111 --> 01:13:04.146
THE BART SYSTEM OVER 50 YEARS

01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:05.614
AGO. AND TODAY, BART AND MUNI

01:13:05.681 --> 01:13:07.583
AND ALL OF OUR TRANSIT SYSTEMS

01:13:07.649 --> 01:13:09.084
CONTINUE TO BE THE LIFEBLOOD OF

01:13:09.151 --> 01:13:10.986
OUR REGIONAL ECONOMY. HUNDREDS

01:13:11.053 --> 01:13:13.088
OF THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTS OF ALL

01:13:13.155 --> 01:13:14.890
INCOME LEVELS DEPEND ON PUBLIC

01:13:14.957 --> 01:13:16.492
TRANSIT TO GET TO WORK EVERY

01:13:16.558 --> 01:13:18.527
DAY. AND MAINTAINING A HIGH

01:13:18.594 --> 01:13:19.962
FUNCTIONING SYSTEM IS ESSENTIAL

01:13:20.028 --> 01:13:21.797
FOR OUR ECONOMY AND OUR OVERALL

01:13:21.864 --> 01:13:23.966
QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE BAY AREA,

01:13:24.032 --> 01:13:25.000
AND CONDITIONS ON THESE SYSTEMS

01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:26.568
HAVE IMPROVED SUBSTANTIALLY IN

01:13:26.635 --> 01:13:28.170
RECENT YEARS. WE NEED THIS

01:13:28.237 --> 01:13:30.038
REGIONAL MEASURE TO ENSURE THAT

01:13:30.105 --> 01:13:31.473
THESE SYSTEMS CONTINUE TO

01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:33.275
OPERATE, AND TO BUILD ON THOSE

01:13:33.342 --> 01:13:34.376
RIDER IMPROVEMENTS GOING

01:13:34.443 --> 01:13:35.711
FORWARD. YET WE KNOW RAISING NEW

01:13:35.778 --> 01:13:37.179
REVENUE WILL NOT BE EASY. WE

01:13:37.246 --> 01:13:38.847
KNOW THAT RESIDENTS ARE FEELING

01:13:38.914 --> 01:13:40.749
THE STRAIN OF THE RISING COST OF

01:13:40.816 --> 01:13:42.084
LIVING, AND POLLING HAS SHOWN

01:13:42.151 --> 01:13:43.452
THAT VOTERS ARE SKEPTICAL ABOUT

01:13:43.519 --> 01:13:45.154
THE NEED FOR NEW MONEY. SO IN

01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:46.955
ORDER TO RESTORE THAT PUBLIC

01:13:47.022 --> 01:13:48.390
CONFIDENCE IN THESE SYSTEMS AND

01:13:48.457 --> 01:13:50.125
TO PASS THIS MEASURE, WE MUST

01:13:50.192 --> 01:13:51.927
FOCUS ON PROVIDING A BETTER

01:13:51.994 --> 01:13:54.129
SERVICE WHILE ALSO USING EACH

01:13:54.196 --> 01:13:55.397
TAXPAYER DOLLAR AS EFFICIENTLY

01:13:55.464 --> 01:13:57.299
AS POSSIBLE. THAT'S WHY WE'VE

01:13:57.366 --> 01:13:58.901
CALLED FOR THIS FINANCIAL

01:13:58.967 --> 01:14:00.936
EFFICIENCY. REVIEW OF THAT HAS

01:14:01.003 --> 01:14:02.704
BEEN INTEGRATED INTO THE BILL.

01:14:02.771 --> 01:14:04.973
THIS REVIEW WILL IDENTIFY AREAS

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.008
TO IMPROVE THE COST

01:14:06.074 --> 01:14:07.242
EFFECTIVENESS OF OPERATIONS,

01:14:07.309 --> 01:14:08.944
WHILE MAINTAINING AND IMPROVING

01:14:09.011 --> 01:14:11.480
SERVICE FOR RIDERS. AND WE'RE

01:14:11.547 --> 01:14:12.447
ALSO WORKING ON AMENDMENTS WITH

01:14:12.514 --> 01:14:13.949
THE AUTHORS AND RELEVANT

01:14:14.016 --> 01:14:14.950
STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THE

01:14:15.017 --> 01:14:16.151
MEANINGFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF

01:14:16.218 --> 01:14:18.086
THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. WE ALSO

01:14:18.153 --> 01:14:21.123
KNOW THAT A RIDER FOCUSED

01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:22.991
IMPROVEMENTS AND SYSTEM ARE

01:14:23.058 --> 01:14:24.660
ESSENTIAL TO PASS THIS MEASURE.

01:14:24.726 --> 01:14:26.195
VOTERS ARE UNLIKELY TO SUPPORT A

01:14:26.261 --> 01:14:30.098
TAX MEASURE THAT THAT THAT A TAX

01:14:30.165 --> 01:14:31.533
INCREASE THAT ONLY FUNDS THE

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:33.702
STATUS QUO OPERATIONS AND THEY

01:19:03.371 --> 01:19:05.207
WE ARE CONCERNED, HOWEVER, THAT

01:19:05.273 --> 01:19:07.742
THE CURRENT FRAMING OF THE BILL

01:19:07.809 --> 01:19:12.147
COMES UP SHORT OF WHAT WE NEED

01:19:12.214 --> 01:19:13.482
TO ACTUALLY FUND THE HOLES THAT

01:19:13.548 --> 01:19:17.853
ARE THERE. THE SALES TAX IS

01:19:17.919 --> 01:19:19.788
MAYBE NOT GOING TO GET TO KEEP

01:19:19.855 --> 01:19:22.057
IT BRIEF IF YOU CAN, NOT GOING

WORK TO BE DONE. WE LOOK FORWARD

01:19:34.769 --> 01:19:36.171
TO WORKING WITH THEM, AND WE'D

01:19:36.238 --> 01:19:38.106
LOVE TO MOVE THE BILL FORWARD.

THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT, MOVING ON

01:19:44.846 --> 01:19:45.947
TO OPPOSITION, I HAD TO I LOST

01:19:46.014 --> 01:19:48.650
MY PLACE WITH THE LAST TWEENERS.

01:19:48.717 --> 01:19:51.186
IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE

01:19:51.253 --> 01:19:53.155
TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF THE

01:19:53.221 --> 01:19:54.923
BILL? I KNOW WE HAVE REGISTERED

01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:55.891
OPPOSITION, BUT NONE SAYING THAT

01:19:55.957 --> 01:19:56.892
THEY WERE GOING TO SPEAK IN

01:19:56.958 --> 01:19:59.895
TESTIMONY. OKAY, ANYONE WHO

01:19:59.961 --> 01:20:01.796
WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WE HAD OUR

01:20:01.863 --> 01:20:02.864
TWEENERS. BUT ANYONE WHO WOULD

01:20:02.931 --> 01:20:04.799
LIKE TO NOTE OPPOSITION NOW

01:20:04.866 --> 01:20:06.301
WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TIME TO DO

01:20:06.368 --> 01:20:08.403
SO. NAME, AFFILIATION AND

01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:11.806
POSITION. ALL RIGHT. SEEING

01:20:11.873 --> 01:20:14.676
NONE, MOVING BACK TO COMMITTEES,

01:20:14.743 --> 01:20:17.279
WE'LL GO TO ROGERS AND THEN I. I

01:20:17.345 --> 01:20:20.315
SEE YOU OVER THERE, RANSOM. SO

01:20:20.382 --> 01:20:23.151
FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU SO MUCH

01:20:23.218 --> 01:20:23.752
FOR BRINGING THE MEASURE. BIG

01:20:23.818 --> 01:20:25.387
SUPPORTER OF PUBLIC TRANSIT. AND

01:20:25.453 --> 01:20:27.689
IN FACT, MY FAVORITE REFRAME FOR

01:20:27.756 --> 01:20:29.524
CONSTITUENTS IS WHEN THEY

01:20:29.591 --> 01:20:30.192
COMPLAIN ABOUT TRAFFIC. I REMIND

01:20:30.258 --> 01:20:31.092
THEM THAT THEY'RE NOT IN

01:20:31.159 --> 01:20:32.494
TRAFFIC. THEY ARE TRAFFIC,

01:20:32.561 --> 01:20:34.095
RIGHT. AND BEING ABLE TO MOVE

01:20:34.162 --> 01:20:37.299
PEOPLE IS CRITICAL. MY ONLY

01:20:37.365 --> 01:20:39.568
CONCERN WITH THE MEASURE IS

01:20:39.634 --> 01:20:41.069
SEEING SOME OF THE POLLING

01:20:41.136 --> 01:20:42.237
AROUND IT. AND I'VE TALKED WITH

01:20:42.304 --> 01:20:44.973
FOLKS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT WHETHER

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:47.209
OR NOT THIS WOULD ACTUALLY COVER

01:20:47.275 --> 01:20:49.511
THE NEEDS OF THE DISTRICTS TO BE

01:20:49.578 --> 01:20:51.146
ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT WE NEED

01:20:51.213 --> 01:20:52.647
TO, TO REBUILD THAT RIDERSHIP.

01:20:52.714 --> 01:20:53.848
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT EVEN

01:20:53.915 --> 01:20:55.116
WITH THIS, SAN FRANCISCO WOULD

01:20:55.183 --> 01:20:56.851
HAVE TO COME BACK AND DO THEIR

01:20:56.918 --> 01:20:58.186
OWN MEASURE AS WELL, WHICH

01:20:58.253 --> 01:21:00.789
COMPLICATES THINGS. I JUST WHAT

01:21:00.855 --> 01:21:04.926
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS YOU NOT

01:21:04.993 --> 01:21:06.094
NARROWING IT OR LIMITING

01:21:06.161 --> 01:21:07.963
YOURSELF TO ONE OPTION. RIGHT.

01:21:08.029 --> 01:21:10.498
BECAUSE THIS IS SUCH A CRITICAL

01:21:10.565 --> 01:21:13.068
MOMENT FOR PUBLIC TRANSIT, NOT

01:21:13.134 --> 01:21:13.969
JUST FOR THESE COUNTIES, BUT

01:21:14.035 --> 01:21:15.837
OTHER COUNTIES THAT RELY ON IT

01:21:15.904 --> 01:21:18.373
AS WELL, LIKE SOME OF MY

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:21.309
COUNTIES THAT KEEPING IT BROADER

01:21:21.376 --> 01:21:23.144
TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE BEST

01:21:23.211 --> 01:21:23.979
DECISION AT THE TIME THAT YOU

01:21:24.045 --> 01:21:25.847
PULL THE TRIGGER TO START GOING

01:21:25.914 --> 01:21:28.216
AFTER A FUNDING MEASURE BASED ON

01:21:28.283 --> 01:21:30.018
WHAT THE POLLING SHOWS, IS GOING

01:21:30.085 --> 01:21:31.286
TO BE SUCCESSFUL, BECAUSE I'M

01:21:31.353 --> 01:21:33.722
NOT CONVINCED THAT A SALES TAX

01:21:33.788 --> 01:21:35.557
IS GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN

01:21:35.624 --> 01:21:36.658
THIS MOMENT WHERE PEOPLE ARE

01:21:36.725 --> 01:21:39.194
FEELING STRAPPED, WHERE WE KNOW

01:21:39.261 --> 01:21:40.662
THAT AFFORDABILITY IS THE NUMBER

01:21:40.729 --> 01:21:41.896
ONE ISSUE, AND WHERE WE SEE IN

01:21:41.963 --> 01:21:44.065
THE POLLING THAT IT DROPS ALMOST

01:21:44.132 --> 01:21:45.767
10%, I THINK IS WHAT I SAW WHEN

01:21:45.834 --> 01:21:48.169
YOU ASKED THAT QUESTION AND

01:21:48.236 --> 01:21:48.737
REMIND PEOPLE THAT THEY'RE

01:21:48.803 --> 01:21:49.571
FEELING STRAPPED AND IF THERE'S

01:21:49.638 --> 01:21:52.040
ANY OPPOSITION, THAT'S A CONCERN

01:21:52.107 --> 01:21:53.875
FOR ME. AND SO I I'LL BE

01:21:53.942 --> 01:21:55.143
SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL TODAY.

01:21:55.210 --> 01:21:56.578
BUT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO

01:21:56.645 --> 01:21:58.213
SERIOUSLY CONSIDER BROADENING

01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:00.415
THE BILL TO INCLUDE OTHER FORMS

01:22:00.482 --> 01:22:02.851
OF REVENUE, EVEN JUST, YOU KNOW,

01:22:02.917 --> 01:22:04.586
WE'VE GOT A CONVERSATION GOING

01:22:04.653 --> 01:22:05.920
AMONGST SOME OF THE MEMBERS

01:22:05.987 --> 01:22:07.255
ABOUT THE WATER'S EDGE

01:22:07.322 --> 01:22:09.424
DESIGNATION AS A STATEWIDE

01:22:09.491 --> 01:22:10.492
OPPORTUNITY TO POTENTIALLY BRING

01:22:10.558 --> 01:22:12.861
IN DIFFERENT REVENUE. I'D JUST

01:22:12.927 --> 01:22:14.996
LOVE TO SEE THIS TO BE A LITTLE

01:22:15.063 --> 01:22:17.032
BIT BROADER. AND THEN BEFORE I

01:22:17.098 --> 01:22:18.566
GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO RESPOND,

01:22:18.633 --> 01:22:20.402
BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE

01:22:20.468 --> 01:22:21.836
TALK MORE BROADLY IN YOUR

01:22:21.903 --> 01:22:23.138
RESPONSE ABOUT POLLING. WE DON'T

01:22:23.204 --> 01:22:26.074
WANT TO GET TOO CLOSE TO A LINE.

01:22:26.141 --> 01:22:26.875
AND SO IF YOU CAN TALK BROADLY

01:22:26.941 --> 01:22:28.043
ABOUT SUPPORT OR OTHER SUPPORT,

01:22:28.109 --> 01:22:29.944
THANK YOU. I WOULD JUST SAY THAT

01:22:30.011 --> 01:22:31.079
THERE HAVE BEEN MANY SURVEYS,

01:22:31.146 --> 01:22:32.047
VARIOUS SURVEYS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:22:32.113 --> 01:22:35.617
DONE. AND THE SURVEYS SHOW THAT

01:22:35.684 --> 01:22:38.053
THERE THERE IS SUPPORT. I WISH

01:22:38.119 --> 01:22:41.056
IT WERE LANDSLIDE SUPPORT, BUT

01:22:41.122 --> 01:22:43.625
IT'S NOT. BUT I DO THINK THAT WE

01:22:43.692 --> 01:22:45.627
CAN SUCCEED. I, I WANT TO BE

01:22:45.694 --> 01:22:46.895
REALLY CRYSTAL CLEAR ABOUT WHAT

01:22:46.961 --> 01:22:50.665
I REALLY THINK, AND THAT IS WE

01:22:50.732 --> 01:22:53.168
SHOULD NOT HAVE TO DO THIS BILL,

01:22:53.234 --> 01:22:54.836
AND WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO HAVE A

01:22:54.903 --> 01:22:57.339
REVENUE MEASURE. THE STATE OF

01:22:57.405 --> 01:22:59.474
CALIFORNIA SHOULD FUND PUBLIC

01:22:59.541 --> 01:23:00.075
TRANSPORTATION, JUST LIKE THE

01:23:00.141 --> 01:23:02.444
STATE OF NEW YORK DOES, AND THE

01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:03.945
STATE OF ILLINOIS AND THE STATE

01:23:04.012 --> 01:23:06.614
OF PENNSYLVANIA AND THE STATE OF

01:23:06.681 --> 01:23:08.750
MASSACHUSETTS THAT, YOU KNOW,

01:23:08.817 --> 01:23:11.920
THEY STEP UP AND FUND PUBLIC

01:23:11.986 --> 01:23:15.857
TRANSPORTATION. CALIFORNIA DOES

01:23:15.924 --> 01:23:17.625
NOT DO WHAT IT NEEDS TO DO. AND

01:23:17.692 --> 01:23:19.961
WE'VE DONE A GOOD JOB ON SOME

01:23:20.028 --> 01:23:21.363
CAPITAL STUFF, ESPECIALLY WHEN

01:23:21.429 --> 01:23:23.631
WE HAD A ONE TIME BIG SURPLUS

01:23:23.698 --> 01:23:25.233
AMOUNT WE PUT IN THE CAPITAL.

01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:26.334
AND THAT'S GREAT. BUT IN TERMS

01:23:26.401 --> 01:23:30.338
OF ONGOING SUSTAINABLE FUNDING

01:23:30.405 --> 01:23:32.073
FOR TRANSIT, BECAUSE WE KNOW IN

01:23:32.140 --> 01:23:34.042
THE BAY AREA IS SO RELIANT ON

01:23:34.109 --> 01:23:35.377
TRANSIT AND, YOU KNOW, LA IS

01:23:35.443 --> 01:23:36.711
DOING GREAT. THERE ARE OTHER

01:23:36.778 --> 01:23:38.980
PARTS OF THE STATE THAT ARE

01:23:39.047 --> 01:23:39.647
EXPANDING THEIR TRANSIT SYSTEMS,

01:23:39.714 --> 01:23:40.815
AND THE STATE SHOULD BE PAYING

01:23:40.882 --> 01:23:42.684
THAT OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND.

01:23:42.751 --> 01:23:43.752
THAT'S NOT THE REALITY THAT

01:23:43.818 --> 01:23:45.387
WE'RE FACING RIGHT NOW. SO WE

01:23:45.453 --> 01:23:46.988
HAVE TO ENGAGE IN SELF-HELP AND

01:23:47.055 --> 01:23:48.390
WE'RE DOING THAT. THERE ARE

01:23:48.456 --> 01:23:50.925
ONGOING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

01:23:50.992 --> 01:23:52.293
REVENUE SOURCE. THEY'RE ALL

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:53.795
COMPLICATED. EVERY SINGLE ONE

01:23:53.862 --> 01:23:54.996
HAS PROS AND CONS WITH THE

01:23:55.063 --> 01:23:56.698
VOTERS, PROS AND CONS WITH

01:23:56.765 --> 01:23:57.966
STAKEHOLDERS WHO MIGHT RUN A

01:23:58.032 --> 01:24:00.602
CAMPAIGN AGAINST IT. AND SO, YOU

01:24:00.668 --> 01:24:03.204
KNOW, IT'S ALL IT'S ALL

01:24:03.271 --> 01:24:04.305
COMPLICATED. THIS IS NOW MY

01:24:04.372 --> 01:24:06.074
THIRD RUN AT IT. THE CHAIR WILL

01:24:06.141 --> 01:24:07.842
REMEMBER TWO YEARS AGO WHEN I

01:24:07.909 --> 01:24:10.378
AND SOMETHING HAPPENED WHEN WE

01:24:10.445 --> 01:24:13.548
TRIED FOR A BRIDGE TOLL INCREASE

01:24:13.615 --> 01:24:15.116
THAT DIDN'T WORK. WE TRIED NINE

01:24:15.183 --> 01:24:16.951
COUNTIES LAST YEAR. THAT DIDN'T

01:24:17.018 --> 01:24:18.853
WORK. AND NOW WE'RE BACK AT IT.

01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:21.089
SO THAT'S MY PERSPECTIVE AND I

01:24:21.156 --> 01:24:23.425
DO APPRECIATE THE DESIRE FOR

01:24:23.491 --> 01:24:25.593
FLEXIBILITY. YEAH I MEAN LIKE I

01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:28.029
SAID ALSO I'M SUPPORTIVE TODAY.

01:24:28.096 --> 01:24:29.731
I JUST WANT AS MANY OPTIONS AS

01:24:29.798 --> 01:24:32.233
POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A

01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:32.801
CRITICAL MOMENT FOR PUBLIC

01:24:32.867 --> 01:24:33.835
TRANSIT. I WONDER IF I JUST CAN

01:24:33.902 --> 01:24:36.171
I ONE MORE THING, BECAUSE LAST

01:24:36.237 --> 01:24:38.540
YEAR WAS A IT WAS AN IMPORTANT

01:24:38.606 --> 01:24:40.208
STEP TO GO THROUGH A PAINFUL

01:24:40.275 --> 01:24:42.076
PROCESS LAST YEAR WITH THE NINE

01:24:42.143 --> 01:24:43.411
COUNTIES, AND ULTIMATELY WE HAD

01:24:43.478 --> 01:24:46.648
TO PAUSE IT BECAUSE THERE WAS

01:24:46.714 --> 01:24:47.215
TOO MUCH RANCOR WITHIN THE

01:24:47.282 --> 01:24:47.882
REGION. THE REASON WE WANTED TO

01:24:47.949 --> 01:24:50.018
DO IT LAST YEAR AND LAST YEAR IS

01:24:50.084 --> 01:24:51.453
MEASURE DID HAVE MULTIPLE

01:24:51.519 --> 01:24:54.189
OPTIONS IN IT IS TO GIVE A FULL

01:24:54.255 --> 01:24:56.157
YEAR PLUS FOR THE REGION TO

01:24:56.224 --> 01:24:57.792
REALLY GET IT ALL TOGETHER AND

01:24:57.859 --> 01:24:59.928
CRAFT SOMETHING TO BE ABLE TO GO

01:24:59.994 --> 01:25:02.163
OUT WITH. WE'RE NOW IT'S A MUCH

01:25:02.230 --> 01:25:04.265
SHORTER TIME FRAME BECAUSE WE'RE

01:25:04.332 --> 01:25:06.201
TALKING ABOUT NOVEMBER 26TH, BUT

01:25:06.267 --> 01:25:08.670
I HEAR YOU AND I DON'T I, I

01:25:08.736 --> 01:25:10.405
DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU

01:25:10.472 --> 01:25:12.507
FUNDAMENTALLY, AND I AGREE WITH

01:25:12.574 --> 01:25:14.509
YOU ON FUNDING AT THE STATE

01:25:14.576 --> 01:25:17.345
LEVEL. THANK YOU. NOW MOVING TO

01:25:17.412 --> 01:25:19.247
RANSOM. THANK YOU CHAIR. THANK

01:25:19.314 --> 01:25:21.583
YOU, SENATOR, FOR BRINGING THIS

01:25:21.649 --> 01:25:24.419
VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC TO US. MY

01:25:24.486 --> 01:25:26.721
DISTRICT IS COMMUTING TO THE BAY

01:25:26.788 --> 01:25:29.257
AREA, OVER 100,000 FOLKS. SO

01:25:29.324 --> 01:25:30.258
DEFINITELY WE NEED TO DO

01:25:30.325 --> 01:25:31.726
SOMETHING TO STRENGTHEN NOT ONLY

01:25:31.793 --> 01:25:32.794
THE SYSTEM, BUT THE

01:25:32.861 --> 01:25:33.695
INTERCONNECTION BETWEEN THE

01:25:33.761 --> 01:25:35.730
SYSTEM, WHICH WOULD IMPROVE

01:25:35.797 --> 01:25:37.999
RIDERSHIP ACROSS THE BOARD FOR

01:25:38.066 --> 01:25:40.134
EVERYONE. SO I'D HOPE TO SEE

01:25:40.201 --> 01:25:41.402
THAT WE DID HEAR SOME KIND OF

01:25:41.469 --> 01:25:42.837
SUPPORT IF AMENDED OR OPPOSE,

01:25:42.904 --> 01:25:45.306
UNLESS AMENDED OR IN BETWEEN

01:25:45.373 --> 01:25:46.441
CONVERSATIONS. SO I'M WONDERING

01:25:46.508 --> 01:25:48.443
IF YOU CAN SPEAK TO WHETHER OR

01:25:48.510 --> 01:25:50.111
NOT YOU'VE ALREADY STARTED

01:25:50.178 --> 01:25:51.145
COMMITTING TO WORKING WITH

01:25:51.212 --> 01:25:54.449
BUSINESS AND OR LABOR IN REGARDS

01:25:54.516 --> 01:25:56.284
TO POTENTIAL AMENDMENTS THAT YOU

01:25:56.351 --> 01:25:59.721
WOULD BE WILLING TO ENTERTAIN TO

01:25:59.787 --> 01:26:01.356
ENSURE MAYBE THE STRONGEST, NOT

01:26:01.422 --> 01:26:03.958
ONLY THE STRONGEST BILL THAT WE

01:26:04.025 --> 01:26:06.327
CAN WORK WITH, BUT ALSO A STRONG

01:26:06.394 --> 01:26:09.764
BALLOT MEASURE. YES. SO WE'RE

01:26:09.831 --> 01:26:12.700
FOR THE LAST FEW FEW MONTHS,

01:26:12.767 --> 01:26:14.636
SENATOR ARAGON AND I HAVE BEEN

01:26:14.702 --> 01:26:17.105
IN CONVERSATION WITH WE'VE BEEN

01:26:17.171 --> 01:26:20.408
MEETING WITH SEIU AND SEIU, 10

01:26:20.475 --> 01:26:22.443
TO 1 IN PARTICULAR, BUT ALSO

01:26:22.510 --> 01:26:24.078
AFSCME, ATU, AND SOME OF THE

01:26:24.145 --> 01:26:26.481
OTHER UNIONS THAT THAT WERE

01:26:26.548 --> 01:26:28.216
MENTIONED BEFORE AND WERE VERY

01:26:28.283 --> 01:26:30.051
APPRECIATIVE OF THEIR

01:26:30.118 --> 01:26:32.954
ENGAGEMENT. AND THEY AND LABOR,

01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:34.789
SEIU IN PARTICULAR, HAS REALLY

01:26:34.856 --> 01:26:36.391
STEPPED UP ON TRANSIT FUNDING IN

01:26:36.457 --> 01:26:38.026
THE BUDGET. AND WE'RE VERY

01:26:38.092 --> 01:26:39.060
APPRECIATIVE OF THAT

01:26:39.127 --> 01:26:41.262
COLLABORATION. WE'RE ALSO IN

01:26:41.329 --> 01:26:44.098
VERY CLOSE CONVERSATION WITH THE

01:26:44.165 --> 01:26:46.200
BUSINESS COMMUNITY, AND WE'RE

01:26:46.267 --> 01:26:49.170
NOW WE WANT EVERYONE AND THERE'S

01:26:49.237 --> 01:26:50.538
CONVERSATIONS HAPPENING BETWEEN

01:26:50.605 --> 01:26:51.639
BUSINESS AND LABOR, BECAUSE

01:26:51.706 --> 01:26:53.741
ULTIMATELY WE ALL NEED TO BE IN

01:26:53.808 --> 01:26:56.311
THIS TOGETHER. SO I DON'T WANT

01:26:56.377 --> 01:26:56.878
TO PREJUDGE ABOUT WHAT THE

01:26:56.945 --> 01:26:58.880
RESULTS WILL BE. AS I JUST

01:26:58.947 --> 01:27:00.248
MENTIONED, THERE ARE SERIOUS

01:27:00.315 --> 01:27:02.750
PROS AND CONS TO EVERY SINGLE

01:27:02.817 --> 01:27:05.753
REVENUE SOURCE. AND SO WE JUST

01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:08.189
WHATEVER WE DO, WE JUST NEED TO

01:27:08.256 --> 01:27:10.725
GET EVERYONE TOGETHER AND THAT

01:27:10.792 --> 01:27:11.993
THOSE ARE THE CONVERSATIONS THAT

01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:15.196
WE'RE HAVING NOW. GOT IT. THANK

01:27:15.263 --> 01:27:17.165
YOU. I APPRECIATE THE CONTINUED

01:27:17.231 --> 01:27:19.801
COLLABORATION AND CONVERSATIONS

01:27:19.867 --> 01:27:20.802
AS YOUR BILL PROGRESSES.

01:27:20.868 --> 01:27:22.270
APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU.

01:27:22.337 --> 01:27:25.073
AARON'S THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR.

01:27:25.139 --> 01:27:27.609
I WANT TO JUST THANK THE AUTHOR

FOR ALL OF ALL OF YOUR WORK AND

ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS WORK ON ON

01:27:32.313 --> 01:27:35.516
THIS MEASURE. AND SO IMPORTANT

01:27:35.583 --> 01:27:37.051
FOR, FOR OUR REGION TO COME

01:27:37.118 --> 01:27:38.519
TOGETHER AND, AND HAVE A

01:27:38.586 --> 01:27:39.821
DEDICATED REVENUE SOURCE. I JUST

01:27:39.887 --> 01:27:42.490
WANT TO SAY HOW MUCH I AGREE

01:27:42.557 --> 01:27:45.059
WITH THE NEED FOR CALIFORNIA TO

01:27:45.126 --> 01:27:49.197
STEP UP AND NOT HAVE THESE DIRE

01:27:49.263 --> 01:27:51.165
EMERGENCY SITUATIONS WHERE IF

01:27:51.232 --> 01:27:53.167
THIS DOES NOT PASS, THEN, YOU

01:27:53.234 --> 01:27:56.104
KNOW, MASS TRANSIT IN THE BAY

01:27:56.170 --> 01:27:57.705
AREA AND BEYOND AS WE KNOW IT

01:27:57.772 --> 01:28:00.575
WILL, WILL FAIL, AND WE SHOULD

01:28:00.642 --> 01:28:02.043
NOT BE PUTTING OURSELVES IN THAT

01:28:02.110 --> 01:28:03.277
POSITION. BUT WITH THAT BEING

01:28:03.344 --> 01:28:08.016
SAID, WE'LL BE SUPPORTING

01:28:08.082 --> 01:28:08.750
CERTAINLY THIS MEASURE. BUT I

01:28:08.816 --> 01:28:11.152
WAS WONDERING IF YOU CAN SORT OF

01:28:11.219 --> 01:28:13.054
SPEAK TO I KNOW THAT, YOU KNOW,

01:28:13.121 --> 01:28:14.055
YOU SORT OF MENTIONED THE RANCOR

01:28:14.122 --> 01:28:16.991
OF, OF, OF HOW THESE REGIONS

01:28:17.058 --> 01:28:18.393
COME TOGETHER. AND I KNOW THAT

01:28:18.459 --> 01:28:20.094
IN MY COUNTY, SANTA CLARA COUNTY

01:28:20.161 --> 01:28:22.397
IS NOT CURRENTLY IN THE BILL,

01:28:22.463 --> 01:28:25.066
BUT THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:28:25.133 --> 01:28:27.869
A FEW COUNTIES TO ADD IN, EVEN

01:28:27.935 --> 01:28:29.237
WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE BILL.

01:28:29.303 --> 01:28:31.205
AND I'M WONDERING IF YOU CAN

01:28:31.272 --> 01:28:32.974
JUST SORT OF CLARIFY THAT AND

01:28:33.041 --> 01:28:35.743
SPEAK TO IT. YEAH. AND SO, SO

01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:38.212
LAST YEAR, YOU KNOW, WE HAD THE

01:28:38.279 --> 01:28:39.113
NINE COUNTIES. THERE WERE SOME

01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:40.348
CHALLENGES IN THE NORTH BAY

01:28:40.415 --> 01:28:42.884
BECAUSE OF THE NEED TO

01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:44.719
REAUTHORIZE THE SALES TAX FOR

01:28:44.786 --> 01:28:46.788
SMART. AND THEN SANTA CLARA

01:28:46.854 --> 01:28:50.725
COUNTY WAS REALLY JUST NOT READY

01:28:50.792 --> 01:28:52.694
OR JUST THERE WAS JUST NOT

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:55.463
SUPPORT IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY

01:28:55.530 --> 01:28:57.799
LAST YEAR. AND SO THAT'S WHY

01:28:57.865 --> 01:28:59.934
WHEN WE RESTARTED IT THIS YEAR,

01:29:00.001 --> 01:29:01.936
WE STARTED IT WITH THE THREE

01:29:02.003 --> 01:29:03.538
COUNTIES THAT WE KNEW HAD A REAL

01:29:03.604 --> 01:29:05.339
INTEREST LEVEL OF BEING IN,

01:29:05.406 --> 01:29:06.908
WHICH ARE THE THREE CORE BART

01:29:06.974 --> 01:29:10.411
COUNTIES, AND WE IMMEDIATELY

01:29:10.478 --> 01:29:12.647
STARTED WORKING WITH SAN MATEO

01:29:12.714 --> 01:29:13.815
COUNTY. I WANT TO THANK THE

01:29:13.881 --> 01:29:14.982
MEMBER, PAPPIN, FOR PLAYING A

01:29:15.049 --> 01:29:16.317
REALLY CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE IN SORT

01:29:16.384 --> 01:29:18.653
OF LAYING OUT WHAT THE ISSUES

01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:21.322
WERE AND WORKING WITH US. SO WE

01:29:21.389 --> 01:29:23.257
APPRECIATE THAT. AND THEN AND SO

01:29:23.324 --> 01:29:24.959
THOSE CONVERSATIONS WERE

01:29:25.026 --> 01:29:26.194
PROCEEDING TO SEE IF THERE WAS A

01:29:26.260 --> 01:29:28.763
PATH WITH SAN MATEO COUNTY AND

01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:30.698
THEN SANTA CLARA COUNTY

01:29:30.765 --> 01:29:33.267
EXPRESSED THAT MAYBE THE COUNTY

01:29:33.334 --> 01:29:35.103
MIGHT BE INTERESTED. AND I WAS I

01:29:35.169 --> 01:29:36.871
WAS MUSIC TO MY EARS. AND WE

01:29:36.938 --> 01:29:39.307
WOULD LOVE FOR THIS TO BE A FIVE

01:29:39.373 --> 01:29:40.641
COUNTY MEASURE. AND SO WE'VE

01:29:40.708 --> 01:29:42.176
BEEN IN ACTIVE CONVERSATIONS

01:29:42.243 --> 01:29:43.878
WITH SANTA CLARA COUNTY. THE ONE

01:29:43.945 --> 01:29:45.947
THING I WILL SAY IS THAT THIS

01:29:46.013 --> 01:29:48.816
HAS TO ALL BE SET IN THE BILL.

01:29:48.883 --> 01:29:50.885
IT CAN'T BE AN OPT IN AFTER THE

01:29:50.952 --> 01:29:53.087
BILL IS SIGNED INTO LAW. IF IT'S

01:29:53.154 --> 01:29:54.822
SUCCESSFUL, JUST BECAUSE OF THE

01:29:54.889 --> 01:29:57.058
NATURE OF IT'S CREATING A NEW A

01:29:57.125 --> 01:29:58.993
NEW DISTRICT FOR THE PURPOSES OF

01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:00.995
THE MEASURE. AND SO THAT'S WHY

01:30:01.062 --> 01:30:03.965
WE PUT THE AUGUST 11TH DEADLINE.

01:30:04.031 --> 01:30:05.299
AND IT WAS A LITTLE EARLIER. WE

01:30:05.366 --> 01:30:06.768
WERE ASKED TO EXTEND IT BECAUSE

01:30:06.834 --> 01:30:09.036
OF THE TIMING OF MEETINGS IN SAN

01:30:09.103 --> 01:30:10.037
MATEO COUNTY. AND SO WE DID

01:30:10.104 --> 01:30:12.240
THAT. AND SO WE HAVE ANOTHER

01:30:12.306 --> 01:30:13.941
MONTH OR SO TO FIGURE IT OUT.

01:30:14.008 --> 01:30:15.543
WELL, I'LL SAY I KNOW THAT WE

01:30:15.610 --> 01:30:17.545
JUST THE COUNTDOWN IS START

01:30:17.612 --> 01:30:19.080
CERTAINLY STARTED. BUT I KNOW

01:30:19.147 --> 01:30:21.015
THAT I KNOW THAT THERE ARE

01:30:21.082 --> 01:30:21.916
AMENDMENTS BEING PROPOSED, AND I

01:30:21.983 --> 01:30:24.185
KNOW THAT I'VE CONTINUING TO

01:30:24.252 --> 01:30:25.887
HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR

01:30:25.953 --> 01:30:28.790
COUNTY ABOUT ADDING IN. I THINK

01:30:28.856 --> 01:30:30.258
THAT, YOU KNOW, I WOULD AGREE. I

01:30:30.324 --> 01:30:32.093
AGREE WITH YOU ON ALL OF YOUR

01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:34.495
POINTS. I ALSO FEEL LIKE THERE

01:30:34.562 --> 01:30:36.931
ARE NOT ANY GOOD OPTIONS TO NOT

01:30:36.998 --> 01:30:38.766
STAY INVOLVED. SO I KNOW THAT

01:30:38.833 --> 01:30:41.235
THERE ARE NEGOTIATIONS ONGOING,

01:30:41.302 --> 01:30:42.436
AND I KNOW THAT YOU'VE ALWAYS

01:30:42.503 --> 01:30:45.339
OPERATED IN GOOD FAITH AND HAPPY

01:30:45.406 --> 01:30:46.307
TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. THANK

01:30:46.374 --> 01:30:49.343
YOU, THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT.

01:30:49.410 --> 01:30:52.713
COLOSSA. THANK YOU SO MUCH,

01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:54.348
CHAIR WILSON. HI, SENATOR

01:30:54.415 --> 01:30:57.118
WIENER, FIRST, THANK YOU SO MUCH

01:30:57.185 --> 01:30:58.586
FOR ALL OF YOUR TREMENDOUS WORK

01:30:58.653 --> 01:31:00.354
ON THIS BILL AND YOUR SUPPORT

01:31:00.421 --> 01:31:02.657
FOR PUBLIC TRANSIT. YOU HAVE A

01:31:02.723 --> 01:31:03.958
PENCHANT FOR TAKING ON SOME

01:31:04.025 --> 01:31:05.760
REALLY EASY ISSUES THIS YEAR, SO

01:31:05.827 --> 01:31:08.029
I COMMEND YOU. I JUST WANTED TO

01:31:08.095 --> 01:31:09.497
FOLLOW UP ON ASSEMBLYMEMBER

01:31:09.564 --> 01:31:11.566
RANSOM'S QUESTION ABOUT SOME OF

01:31:11.632 --> 01:31:14.702
THE ADDITIONAL PENDING CONCERNS

01:31:14.769 --> 01:31:17.772
THAT WE HEARD. I KNOW SEIU WAS

01:31:17.839 --> 01:31:19.473
KIND OF A TWEENER. IT SOUNDED

01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:22.076
LIKE FROM FROM WHAT WE HEARD.

01:31:22.143 --> 01:31:22.877
COULD YOU ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT

01:31:22.944 --> 01:31:26.414
MORE ABOUT KIND OF THE ONGOING

01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:27.415
CONVERSATIONS WITH LABOR, WHAT

01:31:27.481 --> 01:31:29.016
YOU'RE COMMITTED TO, TO DOING,

01:31:29.083 --> 01:31:30.885
IF YOU COULD JUST SHARE A LITTLE

01:31:30.952 --> 01:31:33.621
BIT MORE? YEAH. SO IT'S

01:31:33.688 --> 01:31:34.922
CURRENTLY STRUCTURED AS A SALES

01:31:34.989 --> 01:31:38.626
TAX, SEIU AND SOME OTHER UNIONS,

01:31:38.693 --> 01:31:40.661
AFSCME, ATU, ETC. HAVE COME

01:31:40.728 --> 01:31:42.330
FORWARD EXPRESSING THAT THEY

01:31:42.396 --> 01:31:44.031
WOULD LIKE CONSIDERATION OF A

01:31:44.098 --> 01:31:47.969
GROSS RECEIPTS TAX INSTEAD OF A

01:31:48.035 --> 01:31:49.804
SALES TAX, BECAUSE IT COULD

01:31:49.871 --> 01:31:54.108
GENERATE MORE REVENUE. AND YOU

01:31:54.175 --> 01:31:55.776
KNOW, THERE'S BEEN CONCERN, I

01:31:55.843 --> 01:31:57.078
THINK, IN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY

01:31:57.144 --> 01:31:58.813
ABOUT A REGIONAL GROSS RECEIPTS

01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:01.282
TAX. WE ALSO WE HAVE A GROSS

01:32:01.349 --> 01:32:02.650
RECEIPTS TAX IN SAN FRANCISCO

01:32:02.717 --> 01:32:05.086
AND WHICH WE SWITCHED TO 10 OR

01:32:05.152 --> 01:32:07.688
12 YEARS AGO FROM A PAYROLL TAX.

01:32:07.755 --> 01:32:09.624
AND IT IS A BETTER, I THINK,

01:32:09.690 --> 01:32:11.826
BUSINESS TAX TO HAVE. YOU HAVE

01:32:11.893 --> 01:32:13.928
TO GET IT RIGHT. SAN FRANCISCO

01:32:13.995 --> 01:32:15.263
SCREWED UP ITS EXCUSE MY

01:32:15.329 --> 01:32:16.797
LANGUAGE, MADAM CHAIR, BUT DID

01:32:16.864 --> 01:32:20.034
SCREW UP ITS GROSS RECEIPTS TAX

01:32:20.101 --> 01:32:22.136
IN A BALLOT MEASURE SEVEN YEARS

01:32:22.203 --> 01:32:24.005
AGO THAT EFFECTIVELY DROVE THE

01:32:24.071 --> 01:32:25.673
PAYMENTS INDUSTRY OUT OF SAN

01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:27.241
FRANCISCO ENTIRELY. SO YOU HAVE

01:32:27.308 --> 01:32:30.778
YOU HAVE TO GET IT RIGHT. SO

01:32:30.845 --> 01:32:33.180
THERE'S SO THAT THAT'S THOSE ARE

01:32:33.247 --> 01:32:35.449
THE CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE

01:32:35.516 --> 01:32:37.285
HAPPENING. AND OBVIOUSLY IF WE

01:32:37.351 --> 01:32:38.586
IF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IS

01:32:38.653 --> 01:32:40.454
LIKE INTENSELY OPPOSED TO GROSS

01:32:40.521 --> 01:32:43.024
RECEIPTS TAX, AND THAT WOULD

01:32:43.090 --> 01:32:45.493
TRIGGER A CAMPAIGN, YOU KNOW,

01:32:45.559 --> 01:32:48.462
THAT'S A CHALLENGE FOR ANY

01:32:48.529 --> 01:32:49.764
BALLOT MEASURE. AND SO THAT'S

01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:51.132
WHY WE'RE TRYING TO THREAD THE

01:32:51.198 --> 01:32:52.300
NEEDLE AND REALLY BRING PEOPLE

01:32:52.366 --> 01:32:53.868
TOGETHER. AND THERE ARE MORE

01:32:53.935 --> 01:32:56.237
DIRECT CONVERSATIONS HAPPENING

01:32:56.304 --> 01:32:58.839
NOW, WHICH IS GOOD. AND I JUST

01:32:58.906 --> 01:33:01.275
WE NEED TO JUST ALL THE MAJOR

01:33:01.342 --> 01:33:02.209
STAKEHOLDERS, BECAUSE IF WE

01:33:02.276 --> 01:33:03.210
DON'T HAVE EVERYONE TOGETHER,

01:33:03.277 --> 01:33:04.979
IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY HARD TO

01:33:05.046 --> 01:33:06.247
BE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS ENDEAVOR.

01:33:06.314 --> 01:33:08.683
AND SO WE NEED TO FIGURE IT OUT

01:33:08.749 --> 01:33:09.951
TOGETHER. SO I CAN'T MAKE ANY

01:33:10.017 --> 01:33:12.320
COMMITMENTS TODAY. BUT THOSE

01:33:12.386 --> 01:33:13.921
CONVERSATIONS ARE HAPPENING AND

01:33:13.988 --> 01:33:16.223
I'M NOT SURE WHERE THEY'LL GO.

01:33:16.290 --> 01:33:18.092
OKAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH,

01:33:18.159 --> 01:33:18.960
SENATOR, FOR SHARING A LITTLE

01:33:19.026 --> 01:33:20.795
BIT MORE ON THAT. AND I'M, YOU

01:33:20.861 --> 01:33:22.296
KNOW, SUBBING TODAY FOR OUR

01:33:22.363 --> 01:33:24.031
MAJORITY LEADER, AGUIAR-CURRY,

01:33:24.098 --> 01:33:25.800
WHO COULDN'T BE HERE. BUT I KNOW

01:33:25.866 --> 01:33:27.702
SHE EXPRESSED SOME OF THOSE SAME

01:33:27.768 --> 01:33:29.170
CONCERNS ABOUT JUST MAKING SURE

01:33:29.236 --> 01:33:30.871
THAT OUR WORKERS AND LABOR WAS

01:33:30.938 --> 01:33:32.873
AT THE TABLE. SO I JUST WANTED

01:33:32.940 --> 01:33:34.775
TO ECHO THAT AS I'M CHANNELING

01:33:34.842 --> 01:33:38.879
HER TODAY, BUT OH, DID YOU WANT

01:33:38.946 --> 01:33:40.681
TO ADD ANYTHING MORE? NO, I WILL

01:33:40.748 --> 01:33:42.049
JUST SAY THAT REGARDLESS. BOTTOM

01:33:42.116 --> 01:33:45.987
LINE, IF THERE IS NO SUCCESS,

01:33:46.053 --> 01:33:46.787
OBVIOUSLY IT'S GOING TO BE

01:33:46.854 --> 01:33:48.522
TERRIBLE FOR RIDERS, BUT ALSO

01:33:48.589 --> 01:33:50.224
TERRIBLE FOR WORKERS, WHICH IS

01:33:50.291 --> 01:33:52.626
WHY WE'RE APPRECIATIVE FOR

01:33:52.693 --> 01:33:55.930
LABORS ENGAGEMENT HERE. THANK

01:33:55.997 --> 01:33:56.964
YOU, SENATOR, AND I'LL TELL YOU

01:33:57.031 --> 01:33:59.600
THE GOOD NEWS. I'M HAPPY TO MOVE

01:33:59.667 --> 01:34:00.601
YOUR BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE

01:34:00.668 --> 01:34:02.436
TIME. THANK YOU. SO, MEMBER. ALL

01:34:10.478 --> 01:34:11.645
WANTED TO SECOND LOWENTHAL SINCE

01:34:11.712 --> 01:34:12.880
WE HAD A MOTION. I WANTED TO

01:34:12.947 --> 01:34:14.215
GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A

01:34:14.281 --> 01:34:16.283
SECOND. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.

01:34:16.350 --> 01:34:20.521

WELL, WELL, WELL, HERE WE ARE. I

01:34:25.559 --> 01:34:27.094
REALLY DON'T HAVE A QUESTION. I

01:34:27.161 --> 01:34:28.729
KNOW WE'VE HAD EXTENDED

01:34:28.796 --> 01:34:29.263
CONVERSATIONS. THOSE WILL

01:34:29.330 --> 01:34:30.998
CONTINUE. I JUST WANT TO LET YOU

01:34:31.065 --> 01:34:32.466
KNOW THAT I'M VOTING TODAY WITH

01:34:32.533 --> 01:34:34.235
THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE IS

01:34:34.301 --> 01:34:36.137
ENGAGEMENT. AS YOU WELL KNOW,

01:34:36.203 --> 01:34:37.938
BETWEEN MY COUNTY'S TRANSIT

01:34:38.005 --> 01:34:39.273
AGENCIES AND THE FOLKS IN MY

01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:41.042
COUNTY AND STAKEHOLDERS, THE

01:34:41.108 --> 01:34:42.476
PARTICULARS OF WHICH ARE NOT

01:34:42.543 --> 01:34:45.479
CURRENTLY IN THIS BILL, AND

01:34:45.546 --> 01:34:46.781
THOSE DISCUSSIONS ARE

01:34:46.847 --> 01:34:48.716
CONTINUING, AND IT'S IF

01:34:48.783 --> 01:34:50.818
FRUITFUL. I WANT TO THANK MADAM

01:34:50.885 --> 01:34:52.987

01:34:53.054 --> 01:34:53.988
SEEING THIS BILL, PERHAPS COME

01:34:54.055 --> 01:34:57.058

01:34:57.124 --> 01:34:58.225
FURTHER CONSIDERATION ABOUT THE

01:34:58.292 --> 01:34:59.060
THINGS THAT DO AFFECT SAN MATEO

01:34:59.126 --> 01:35:01.362
COUNTY. AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR

01:35:01.429 --> 01:35:03.064
ENGAGEMENT. CERTAINLY WITH OUR

01:35:03.130 --> 01:35:05.800
COUNTY. IT HAS BEEN QUITE A

01:35:05.866 --> 01:35:08.135
RIDE, NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. THE

01:35:08.202 --> 01:35:10.571
COUNTY BRINGS ITS OWN ISSUES AND

01:35:10.638 --> 01:35:12.740
ATTRIBUTES AND ALL OF THOSE GOOD

01:35:12.807 --> 01:35:15.409
THINGS. AND WE GOT A LITTLE MUNI

01:35:15.476 --> 01:35:17.311
IN OUR COUNTY. WE GOT BART, WE

01:35:17.378 --> 01:35:19.914
GOT CALTRAIN, AND WE DO HAVE OUR

01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:22.416
OWN BUS SYSTEM TOO. AND SO.

01:35:22.483 --> 01:35:24.185
VTA'S GOT THEIR OWN ISSUES. SO

01:35:24.251 --> 01:35:25.352
WE'LL CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION. I

01:35:25.419 --> 01:35:27.788
JUST WANT TO I WILL BE VOTING

01:35:27.855 --> 01:35:29.023
TODAY FOR THE BILL, AND I LOOK

01:35:29.090 --> 01:35:32.226
FORWARD TO WHAT WE CAN GET ON

01:35:32.293 --> 01:35:35.129
PAPER. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT.

01:35:35.196 --> 01:35:36.864
JUST MAKING SURE NO OTHER

01:35:36.931 --> 01:35:39.033
COMMITTEE MEMBER HAS COMMENTS

01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:41.068
THERE OR NOT. I'LL NOTE. YOU

01:35:41.135 --> 01:35:42.937
KNOW, WE KNOW. THANK YOU,

01:35:43.003 --> 01:35:45.673
SENATOR WIENER, FOR YOUR WORK.

01:35:45.739 --> 01:35:47.575
AS MY COLLEAGUE NOTED, YOU TAKE

01:35:47.641 --> 01:35:49.877
ALL THE EASY THINGS SO THAT WE

01:35:49.944 --> 01:35:51.312
CAN GET THINGS DONE HERE IN

01:35:51.378 --> 01:35:53.047
CALIFORNIA. AND WE KNOW THAT

01:35:53.114 --> 01:35:55.116
THIS BILL IS VITAL, VITALLY

01:35:55.182 --> 01:35:57.384
IMPORTANT TO THE BAY AREA,

01:35:57.451 --> 01:35:59.987
ESPECIALLY THE FOUR MAJOR

01:36:00.054 --> 01:36:02.756
TRANSIT OPERATORS THAT ARE ARE

01:36:02.823 --> 01:36:04.425
LISTED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE

01:36:04.492 --> 01:36:06.193
BILL. THEY COVER 80% OF THE

01:36:06.260 --> 01:36:08.162
TRANSIT RIDES IN THE BAY AREA,

01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:10.197
AND 30% OF ALL TRANSIT RIDERS IN

01:36:10.264 --> 01:36:12.066
THE STATE. THAT'S A PRETTY BIG

01:36:12.133 --> 01:36:15.269
DEAL. AND SO WITHOUT THEM,

01:36:15.336 --> 01:36:17.037
PEOPLE CAN'T MOVE. AND WE KNOW

01:36:17.104 --> 01:36:19.740
WHAT TRAFFIC LOOKS LIKE WHEN ONE

01:36:19.807 --> 01:36:21.842
OF THOSE IS OUT. YOU NOTED IN

01:36:21.909 --> 01:36:22.877
YOUR TESTIMONY, AND IT IS. AND

01:36:22.943 --> 01:36:24.778
IT IS TRUE. THE MORE PEOPLE WHO

01:36:24.845 --> 01:36:27.281
CHOOSE TO GET INTO THEIR CARS IN

01:36:27.348 --> 01:36:28.649
THE BAY AREA MAKES IT HARDER FOR

01:36:28.716 --> 01:36:29.750
EVERY SINGLE PERSON. AND SO

01:36:29.817 --> 01:36:31.619
THAT'S WHY IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR

01:36:31.685 --> 01:36:33.487
ME, EVEN WHEN THIS BILL PRIOR

01:36:33.554 --> 01:36:34.822
ITERATION OF THIS BILL WAS

01:36:34.889 --> 01:36:37.024
BEFORE OUR COMMITTEE, TO SEE IT

01:36:37.091 --> 01:36:40.027
GET TO THE FINISH LINE. HOWEVER,

01:36:40.094 --> 01:36:41.762
WE HAVE GOTTEN TO THIS PLACE

01:36:41.829 --> 01:36:44.098
WHERE WE THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO

01:36:44.165 --> 01:36:46.167
BE A BIT MORE BAKED BEFORE IT

01:36:46.233 --> 01:36:46.800
GOT TO THIS COMMITTEE AND IT

01:36:46.867 --> 01:36:48.302
WASN'T. AND SO THAT WAS A BIT

01:36:48.369 --> 01:36:50.037
FRUSTRATING. WE HAVE A LOT OF

01:36:50.104 --> 01:36:51.405
QUESTIONS AND PEOPLE ARE ASKING

01:36:51.472 --> 01:36:52.806
THEM, AND THERE'S STILL MORE

01:36:52.873 --> 01:36:54.408
WORK TO BE DONE. AND I

01:36:54.475 --> 01:36:55.042
APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT FOR

01:36:55.109 --> 01:36:56.810
CONTINUING THAT WORK. WE HAVE TO

01:36:56.877 --> 01:36:57.878
KNOW WHICH COUNTIES ARE

01:36:57.945 --> 01:36:59.246
PARTICIPATING. WE HAVE TO KNOW

01:36:59.313 --> 01:37:01.115
WHAT A DETAILED EXPENDITURE PLAN

01:37:01.182 --> 01:37:04.084
LOOKS LIKE SO THAT OUR

01:37:04.151 --> 01:37:05.519
CONSTITUENCIES CAN BE FULLY

01:37:05.586 --> 01:37:08.722
INFORMED. AND SO I LOOK FORWARD

01:37:08.789 --> 01:37:09.924
TO MY COMMITTEE BEING INVOLVED

01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:11.592
IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS, AS WELL AS

01:37:11.659 --> 01:37:12.993
SOME KEY MEMBERS OF THIS

01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:14.528
COMMITTEE BEING INVOLVED IN

01:37:14.595 --> 01:37:15.829
THESE DISCUSSIONS TO ENSURE THAT

01:37:15.896 --> 01:37:17.064
WE GET THIS ACROSS THE FINISH

01:37:17.131 --> 01:37:19.266
LINE AND BE ABLE TO DELIVER ON

01:37:19.333 --> 01:37:22.036
BEHALF OF THE BAY AREA. AND SO

01:37:22.102 --> 01:37:23.337
WITH THAT, THERE HAS BEEN A

01:37:23.404 --> 01:37:25.973
MOTION BY, LET'S SEE, WHO WAS

01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:29.643

01:37:34.415 --> 01:37:35.983
THOUGHT IT WAS LOWENTHAL IS THAT

01:37:36.050 --> 01:37:39.386
IT WAS LOWENTHAL. BUT THE SECOND

01:37:39.453 --> 01:37:41.555
BY LOWENTHAL. AND SO WITH THAT,

01:37:41.622 --> 01:37:42.890
I'LL GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:37:42.957 --> 01:37:44.858

THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR AND

01:39:18.686 --> 01:39:20.254
MEMBERS, I'M HERE TODAY TO

01:39:20.321 --> 01:39:22.022
PRESENT SB 263, WHICH DIRECTS

01:39:22.089 --> 01:39:23.657
THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION

01:39:23.724 --> 01:39:25.159
AGENCY TO CONDUCT A STUDY ON THE

01:39:25.225 --> 01:39:26.527
IMPACTS OF TARIFFS ON

01:39:26.593 --> 01:39:28.062
CALIFORNIA. TARIFFS IMPOSED

01:39:28.128 --> 01:39:29.096
WITHOUT CAREFUL STRATEGIC

01:39:29.163 --> 01:39:30.597
PLANNING, WILL RAISE COSTS FOR

01:39:30.664 --> 01:39:31.765
CALIFORNIA FAMILIES AND

01:39:31.832 --> 01:39:33.367
BUSINESSES AND HARM OUR WORKERS.

01:39:33.434 --> 01:39:34.935
IN FACT, I JUST SAW AN ARTICLE

01:39:35.002 --> 01:39:37.771
FROM JP MORGAN CHASE THAT SAID

01:39:37.838 --> 01:39:39.340
THAT IT IS ESTIMATED THAT DIRECT

01:39:39.406 --> 01:39:42.042
COSTS ON EMPLOYERS WOULD BE AT

01:39:42.109 --> 01:39:43.544
$82 BILLION. THAT WOULD BE

01:39:43.610 --> 01:39:46.046
REALIZED IN PRICE HIKES, HIRING

01:39:46.113 --> 01:39:47.948
FREEZES, LOWER PROFIT MARGINS AS

01:39:48.015 --> 01:39:49.616
WELL AS LAYOFFS, WHICH IS

01:39:49.683 --> 01:39:50.751
UNFORTUNATE. AND THE PORT OF

01:39:50.818 --> 01:39:52.286
LONG BEACH THAT I REPRESENT, AS

01:39:52.353 --> 01:39:54.421

01:40:03.364 --> 01:40:04.398
FINANCE IS ALSO PROJECTING AN

01:40:04.465 --> 01:40:06.567
ALMOST $8 BILLION DROP IN STATE

01:40:06.633 --> 01:40:07.801
REVENUES DUE TO TARIFFS, WHICH

01:40:07.868 --> 01:40:10.137
HAS CONTRIBUTED TO OUR BUDGET

01:40:10.204 --> 01:40:13.040
DEFICIT. SB 263 WILL ENSURE

01:40:13.107 --> 01:40:14.475
POLICYMAKERS HAVE COMPREHENSIVE

01:40:14.541 --> 01:40:16.243
STATEWIDE DATA TO HELP US

01:40:16.310 --> 01:40:17.378
UNDERSTAND THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS

01:40:17.444 --> 01:40:19.813
ON THESE TARIFFS AND THE DESIGN

01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:22.116
AND DESIGN A DATA DRIVEN POLICY

01:40:22.182 --> 01:40:23.450
TO MITIGATE NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON

01:40:23.517 --> 01:40:25.686

SEA BASED TRADE FUELS OUR

STATE'S ECONOMY. GIVEN THESE

01:41:17.104 --> 01:41:18.872
PROFOUND ECONOMIC IMPACTS, IT'S

01:41:18.939 --> 01:41:20.240
IMPERATIVE THAT THE STATE HAVE A

01:41:28.682 --> 01:41:30.050
IMPACT CALIFORNIA POSITIVELY AND

01:41:30.117 --> 01:41:32.085
NEGATIVELY. THIS CRITICAL

INVESTMENT IN PROTECTING THE

01:42:36.950 --> 01:42:38.318
THE IMPACTS OF TARIFFS ON

01:42:38.385 --> 01:42:40.120
CALIFORNIA'S CONSUMERS AND

01:42:40.187 --> 01:42:41.722
BUSINESSES, ENSURING THAT

01:42:41.788 --> 01:42:43.156
POLICYMAKERS AND REGULATORS HAVE

01:42:43.223 --> 01:42:45.192
THE NECESSARY DATA TO RESPOND

01:42:45.259 --> 01:42:46.393
APPROPRIATELY AND PROTECT THE

01:42:46.460 --> 01:42:48.362
STATE'S ECONOMIC VITALITY AND

01:42:48.428 --> 01:42:50.264
AFFORDABILITY. GIVEN THE IMMENSE

01:42:50.330 --> 01:42:52.032
SCALE AND ECONOMIC SIGNIFICANCE

01:42:52.099 --> 01:42:53.934
OF CALIFORNIA'S RETAIL SECTOR,

01:42:54.001 --> 01:42:55.269
THE IMPOSITION OF TARIFFS COULD

01:42:55.335 --> 01:42:57.804
HAVE A DIRECT AND ADVERSE IMPACT

01:42:57.871 --> 01:43:00.274
ON BOTH THE STATE'S ECONOMY AND

01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:01.108
CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. AS

01:43:01.174 --> 01:43:02.910
CALIFORNIA'S CONTINUE TO FACE A

01:43:02.976 --> 01:43:04.044
COST OF LIVING CRISIS,

01:43:04.111 --> 01:43:06.113
ADDITIONAL TARIFFS RISK FURTHER

01:43:06.179 --> 01:43:07.347
INCREASING THE FINANCIAL BURDEN

01:43:07.414 --> 01:43:10.183
ON FAMILIES AND EXACERBATE THE

01:43:10.250 --> 01:43:11.985
AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES. WITH

01:43:12.052 --> 01:43:14.521
TARIFFS NOW RANGING FROM 10% TO

01:43:14.588 --> 01:43:17.324
AS HIGH AS 145% AND AFFECTING A

01:43:17.391 --> 01:43:19.493
WIDE RANGE OF GOODS, IT IS

01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:20.327
INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO

01:43:20.394 --> 01:43:21.995
QUANTIFY THE FULL SCOPE OF THEIR

01:43:22.062 --> 01:43:23.096
IMPACT ON RETAIL SALES AND

01:43:23.163 --> 01:43:25.332
CONSUMER CONFIDENCE. PRELIMINARY

01:43:25.399 --> 01:43:27.234
ANALYSIS FROM THE BUDGET LAB AT

01:43:27.301 --> 01:43:28.368
YALE ESTIMATES THAT THESE

01:43:28.435 --> 01:43:29.536
TARIFFS COULD TRANSLATE TO AN

01:43:29.603 --> 01:43:32.239
AVERAGE OF $3,800 IN INCREASES

01:43:32.306 --> 01:43:34.575
TO ANNUAL HOUSEHOLD COSTS,

01:43:34.641 --> 01:43:35.509
PLACING SIGNIFICANT STRAIN ON

01:43:35.576 --> 01:43:37.344
FAMILY BUDGETS AND ALTERING

01:43:37.411 --> 01:43:39.179
SPENDING PATTERNS. THIS IS

01:43:39.246 --> 01:43:41.048
ESPECIALLY TRUE AS CALIFORNIA

01:43:41.114 --> 01:43:42.416
FAMILIES START THEIR BACK TO

01:43:42.482 --> 01:43:44.585

LARGE AND SMALL, GEAR UP FOR THE

01:43:46.787 --> 01:43:48.589
HOLIDAY SEASON. THE RETAIL

01:43:48.655 --> 01:43:49.957
SECTOR IS A KEY DRIVER OF

01:43:50.023 --> 01:43:51.658
CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. THE DATA

01:43:51.725 --> 01:43:53.527
PROVIDED FROM SB 263 IS

01:43:53.594 --> 01:43:55.395
IMPERATIVE AS POLICYMAKERS,

01:43:55.462 --> 01:43:57.598
REGULATORS AND RETAILERS WORK TO

01:43:57.664 --> 01:43:59.132
NAVIGATE THE UNCERTAINTIES THAT

01:43:59.199 --> 01:44:00.734
THESE TARIFFS COULD HAVE FOR

01:44:00.801 --> 01:44:02.903
YEARS TO COME. FOR THESE

01:44:02.970 --> 01:44:04.638

01:45:30.991 --> 01:45:32.959
I'M PROUD TO BE A COAUTHOR ON

01:45:33.026 --> 01:45:34.327
THIS BILL. THIS AFFECTS OUR

01:45:34.394 --> 01:45:36.163

01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:41.468
THIS AFFECTS US. THE ENTIRE

01:45:41.535 --> 01:45:44.104
STATE, THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. AND

01:45:44.171 --> 01:45:45.605
IF YOU LOOK AT TODAY'S STOCK

01:45:45.672 --> 01:45:47.641
MARKET, LOOK AT STOCK MARKET

01:45:47.708 --> 01:45:50.577
TODAY, DROPPING 400 PLUS POINTS

01:45:50.644 --> 01:45:52.679
WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENTS OF

01:45:52.746 --> 01:45:57.084
TARIFFS TO JAPAN AND OTHERWISE,

01:45:57.150 --> 01:45:59.119
25% AND OTHER SOUTHEAST ASIAN

01:45:59.186 --> 01:46:00.987
COUNTRIES AS WELL AS SOUTH

01:46:01.054 --> 01:46:02.322
AFRICA. AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT

01:46:02.389 --> 01:46:04.291
CAME WITH LETTERS THAT SAID THE

01:46:04.357 --> 01:46:07.060
TARIFFS MAY CHANGE AT HIS WHIM.

01:46:07.127 --> 01:46:09.296
AND I CAN TELL YOU NOT NOT

01:46:09.362 --> 01:46:10.363
SPEAKING WITH LEGISLATORS HAT

01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:12.199
ON, BUT AS A BUSINESS PERSON,

01:46:12.265 --> 01:46:15.035
YOU KNOW, PRICING IS CRITICAL

01:46:15.102 --> 01:46:17.204
COMPONENT. BUT PLANNING IS SUCH

01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:19.272
AN IMPORTANT PART OF RUNNING ANY

01:46:19.339 --> 01:46:21.508
SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS ANYWHERE.

01:46:21.575 --> 01:46:22.909
AND WE HAVE NO ABILITY TO PLAN

01:46:22.976 --> 01:46:26.146
RIGHT NOW. THE SUIT I JUST

01:46:26.213 --> 01:46:27.714
BOUGHT, AS A MATTER OF FACT,

01:46:27.781 --> 01:46:29.750
BECAUSE THE PLACE WHERE I GET

01:46:29.816 --> 01:46:33.019
SUITS IS HAVING A DISCOUNT, A

01:46:33.086 --> 01:46:36.156
PRE-TARIFF PRICING FOR SUITS

01:46:36.223 --> 01:46:38.225
BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY DO NOT KNOW

01:46:38.291 --> 01:46:40.460
WHAT THEIR COST OF MATERIALS TO

01:46:40.527 --> 01:46:41.928
GO OUT AND SELL BUSINESS SUITS

01:46:41.995 --> 01:46:44.097
ARE GOING TO BE AFTERWARDS.

01:46:44.164 --> 01:46:46.166
BUSINESSES CANNOT PLAN WITHOUT

01:46:46.233 --> 01:46:47.434
LEVELS OF CERTAINTY, AND I

01:46:47.501 --> 01:46:48.902
CERTAINLY THINK THAT THIS STUDY

01:46:48.969 --> 01:46:50.871
IS GOING TO HELP CONTRIBUTE TO

01:46:50.937 --> 01:46:52.606
HOW WE CAN MAKE THINGS MORE

01:46:52.672 --> 01:46:53.173
CERTAIN GOING FORWARD. THANK

01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:55.675
YOU, SENATOR, SO MUCH. ALL

01:46:55.742 --> 01:46:58.278
RIGHT, JACKSON, THANK YOU VERY

01:46:58.345 --> 01:46:59.579
MUCH, SENATOR, FOR THIS

01:46:59.646 --> 01:47:03.250
IMPORTANT BILL. FOR THOSE OF US

01:47:03.316 --> 01:47:04.584
WHO HAVE SIGNIFICANT FOOTPRINTS

01:47:04.651 --> 01:47:06.186
OF THE GOODS MOVEMENT, OF

01:47:06.253 --> 01:47:08.088
COURSE, GOODS START IN YOUR

01:47:08.155 --> 01:47:09.055
DISTRICT AT THE PORTS AND THEN

01:47:09.122 --> 01:47:11.958
COME TO MIND IN THE INLAND

01:47:12.025 --> 01:47:12.559
EMPIRE FOR THE WHERE THEY ARE

01:47:12.626 --> 01:47:14.661
STORED BEFORE THEY GO OUT TO THE

01:47:14.728 --> 01:47:15.729
REST OF THE WORLD. AND

01:47:15.796 --> 01:47:18.131
CERTAINLY, IF THERE ARE ECONOMIC

01:47:18.198 --> 01:47:19.132
IMPACTS AT THE PORTS, THEY WILL

01:47:19.199 --> 01:47:22.135
HAVE RIPPLE EFFECTS THROUGHOUT

01:47:22.202 --> 01:47:24.771
THE GOODS MOVEMENT SYSTEM. AND

01:47:24.838 --> 01:47:26.606
SO VERY IMPORTANT. BILL WOULD

01:47:26.673 --> 01:47:28.909
LOVE TO EXCITE TO SEE. WELL, NOW

01:47:28.975 --> 01:47:30.343
MAYBE I'M NOT EXCITED TO SEE

01:47:30.410 --> 01:47:33.480
WHAT THE IMPACT IS GOING TO BE,

01:47:33.547 --> 01:47:36.016
BUT LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING SO

01:47:36.082 --> 01:47:40.020
THAT PEOPLE REALLY KNOW HOW MUCH

01:47:40.086 --> 01:47:42.455
AND HOW IMPORTANT THE GOODS

01:47:42.522 --> 01:47:44.090
MOVEMENT IS TO OUR ENTIRE

01:47:44.157 --> 01:47:46.126
ECONOMY AND THE HARMFUL EFFECTS

01:47:46.193 --> 01:47:47.494
THESE TARIFFS CAN REALLY HAVE.

01:47:47.561 --> 01:47:50.063
AND SO I WOULD LOVE TO BE A

01:47:50.130 --> 01:47:52.866
COAUTHOR IF YOU IF YOU WOULD

01:47:52.933 --> 01:47:58.605
HAVE ME. WRITE RANSOM. THANK

01:47:58.672 --> 01:48:00.140
YOU. THANK YOU, SENATOR, FOR

01:48:00.207 --> 01:48:01.975
BRINGING THIS VERY FORWARD

01:48:02.042 --> 01:48:04.277
THINKING APPROACH TO SOMETHING

01:48:04.344 --> 01:48:06.079
THAT'S STILL KIND OF UP IN THE

01:48:06.146 --> 01:48:07.080
AIR. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT

01:48:07.147 --> 01:48:09.883
LEADS ME TO MY QUESTION AS

01:48:09.950 --> 01:48:11.284
ANOTHER ASSEMBLY MEMBER JUST

01:48:11.351 --> 01:48:12.719
JUST MENTIONED, YOU KNOW, WE

01:48:12.786 --> 01:48:14.454
WAKE UP DIFFERENT DAYS DEPENDING

01:48:14.521 --> 01:48:16.823
ON, YOU KNOW, WHICH WAY THE WIND

01:48:16.890 --> 01:48:18.959
BLOWS. WE MAY GET A DIFFERENT

01:48:19.025 --> 01:48:21.161
TARIFF OR A DIFFERENT NEGOTIATED

01:48:21.228 --> 01:48:22.295
TARIFF. AND I'M JUST WONDERING,

01:48:22.362 --> 01:48:23.930
SINCE WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING A

01:48:23.997 --> 01:48:27.234
STUDY, HOW YOU PLAN TO SOLVE FOR

01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:28.969
THINGS THAT ARE ALL OVER THE

01:48:29.035 --> 01:48:30.737
PLACE, HAVE YOU ALREADY THOUGHT

01:48:30.804 --> 01:48:32.706
ABOUT THAT? AND IF YOU CAN SPEAK

01:48:32.772 --> 01:48:34.107
TO THAT, I'D LOVE TO HEAR SO

01:48:34.174 --> 01:48:35.976
THAT WE KNOW THAT I KNOW THIS IS

01:48:36.042 --> 01:48:37.911
AN URGENCY, BILL, THAT WE WANT

01:48:37.978 --> 01:48:39.512
TO HAVE A RESPONSE BY JANUARY,

01:48:39.579 --> 01:48:40.914
BUT WE JUST NEVER KNOW WHAT

01:48:40.981 --> 01:48:42.682
WE'RE GOING TO BE DEALING WITH,

01:48:42.749 --> 01:48:43.884
YOU KNOW, AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

01:48:43.950 --> 01:48:46.086
SO I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW HOW YOU

01:48:46.152 --> 01:48:47.854
PLAN TO ADDRESS THAT IN THIS

01:48:47.921 --> 01:48:48.855
STUDY. YEAH. THANK YOU VERY

01:48:48.922 --> 01:48:50.023
MUCH. AND THAT'S A VERY

01:48:50.090 --> 01:48:51.791
IMPORTANT QUESTION. I THINK WHAT

01:48:51.858 --> 01:48:53.026
WE'VE NOTICED FROM THE LAST

01:48:53.093 --> 01:48:54.661
TRUMP TERM, THE FIRST TRUMP TERM

01:48:54.728 --> 01:48:56.596
WAS THE PORT OF LA, EXPERIENCED

01:48:56.663 --> 01:48:59.699
A 19% DROP IN CARGO JUST IN A

01:48:59.766 --> 01:49:01.768
VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. WE

01:49:01.835 --> 01:49:02.769
ALREADY KNOW THAT THERE'S

01:49:02.836 --> 01:49:04.170
STUDIES OUT THERE NOW THAT SAY,

01:49:04.237 --> 01:49:06.506
AGAIN, AS I SAID IN MY FIRST

01:49:06.573 --> 01:49:07.807
INTRODUCTION, THAT $82 BILLION

01:49:07.874 --> 01:49:12.212
MAY BE THE HIT TOWARDS THE, THE

01:49:12.279 --> 01:49:13.179
EMPLOYERS THAT ARE LITERALLY

01:49:13.246 --> 01:49:14.915
DEALING WITH THIS EVERY SINGLE

01:49:14.981 --> 01:49:16.917
DAY. THE CONSUMER PRICES ARE

01:49:16.983 --> 01:49:18.118
VAST. THEY'RE GOING UP ON JUST

01:49:18.184 --> 01:49:19.486
ABOUT EVERYTHING. I WAS ALSO

01:49:19.552 --> 01:49:20.687
JUST SIMILAR TO WHAT

01:49:20.754 --> 01:49:21.922
ASSEMBLYMEMBER LOWENTHAL SAID. I

01:49:21.988 --> 01:49:23.690
WAS IN THE MARKET TO BUY A NEW

01:49:23.757 --> 01:49:25.859
CAR, AND THAT MIGHT BE OFF THE

01:49:25.926 --> 01:49:26.993
TABLE BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT $20,000

01:49:27.060 --> 01:49:29.162
MORE THAN I HAD EXPECTED IT TO

01:49:29.229 --> 01:49:30.664
BE. BUT BECAUSE IT'S MOVING SO

01:49:30.730 --> 01:49:33.133
FAST, WE THINK THAT EVEN IN

01:49:33.199 --> 01:49:33.934
THESE BLIPS OF TIME THAT WE

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:35.835
KNOW, LIKE JULY 9TH IS SUPPOSED

01:49:35.902 --> 01:49:37.671
TO BE THE END DATE FOR THE

01:49:37.737 --> 01:49:40.206
REPRIEVE ON THE 90 DAYS FOR THE

01:49:40.273 --> 01:49:41.908
10%. SO WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS

01:49:41.975 --> 01:49:44.010
IN TWO DAYS. BUT EVEN IN THESE

01:49:44.077 --> 01:49:45.545
THIS TIME, THAT 90 DAY REPRIEVE,

01:49:45.612 --> 01:49:46.980
IT HAS CAUSED SUCH A RIPPLE

01:49:47.047 --> 01:49:49.449
EFFECT. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

01:49:49.516 --> 01:49:50.116
THAT WE ARE ACCOUNTING FOR THAT.

01:49:50.183 --> 01:49:52.085
SO WE DO WANT AN URGENCY. WE

01:49:52.152 --> 01:49:52.919
UNDERSTAND IT'S A VERY SHORT

01:49:52.986 --> 01:49:55.055
TIME FRAME. BUT I THINK THAT

01:49:55.121 --> 01:49:56.957
THESE, YOU KNOW, THE CHANGES IN

01:49:57.023 --> 01:49:59.025
THE ECONOMICS, I THINK ARE

01:49:59.092 --> 01:50:01.861
WORTHY OF ACCOUNTING FOR. AND

01:50:01.928 --> 01:50:03.697
THEN WE ALSO HAVE BUILT IN AS

01:50:03.763 --> 01:50:04.764
WELL, WHICH I WAS GOING TO

01:50:04.831 --> 01:50:06.666
MENTION A MEASUREMENT, THE TYPE

01:50:06.733 --> 01:50:07.934
OF, OF MODEL AND MEASUREMENT

01:50:08.001 --> 01:50:09.703
THAT WE NEED TO APPLY. SO THAT

01:50:09.769 --> 01:50:11.638
WAY THE NEXT TIME THIS HAPPENS

01:50:11.705 --> 01:50:13.006
THAT THERE IS SOMETHING IN PLACE

01:50:13.073 --> 01:50:14.808
THAT WILL FULLY ANALYZE WITH

01:50:14.874 --> 01:50:17.377
THIS SPECIFIC MODEL AND METRICS

01:50:17.444 --> 01:50:18.912
ON ON WHAT TO DO NEXT TIME, JUST

01:50:18.979 --> 01:50:21.214
TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:50:21.281 --> 01:50:22.282
PREPARED. SO I HOPE THAT ANSWERS

01:50:22.349 --> 01:50:23.450
YOUR QUESTION. IT DOES. THANK

01:50:23.516 --> 01:50:24.985
YOU. WE CAN APPRECIATE IT. THANK

01:50:25.051 --> 01:50:26.152
YOU, THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT

01:50:26.219 --> 01:50:28.054
ROGERS, THANK YOU. I TOO WOULD

01:50:28.121 --> 01:50:29.022
JUST LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A

01:50:29.089 --> 01:50:31.124
COAUTHOR. AND IF THE CHAIR IS

01:50:31.191 --> 01:50:32.759
LOOKING FOR A MOTION, HAPPY TO

01:50:32.826 --> 01:50:34.627
MAKE ONE. I THINK WE HAVE ONE.

01:50:34.694 --> 01:50:36.162
PAPIN AND LOWENTHAL. BUT WE I

01:50:36.229 --> 01:50:39.366
HEAR WE HAVE A THIRD AND A

01:50:39.432 --> 01:50:40.700
FOURTH. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.

01:50:40.767 --> 01:50:43.937
MR. THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR. I

01:50:44.004 --> 01:50:45.705
WANT TO START BY SAYING I THINK

01:50:45.772 --> 01:50:47.540
THE STUDY I HAVE NO PROBLEMS

01:50:47.607 --> 01:50:48.775
WITH THE STUDY, BUT I DON'T

01:50:48.842 --> 01:50:50.610
THINK THE STUDY GOES FAR ENOUGH.

01:50:50.677 --> 01:50:52.278
WHEN MY FAMILY COMES FROM THE

01:50:52.345 --> 01:50:53.646
FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN. SO WHEN I

01:50:53.713 --> 01:50:55.715
TELL YOU THAT WE HAVE PERISHABLE

01:50:55.782 --> 01:50:56.916
PRODUCTS, THAT THE MOVEMENT OF

01:50:56.983 --> 01:50:59.953
THIS PRODUCT IS VERY IMPORTANT.

01:51:00.020 --> 01:51:01.187
I'VE WATCHED CLOSELY NOT JUST

01:51:01.254 --> 01:51:02.188
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE

01:51:02.255 --> 01:51:03.289
TARIFFS, BUT WHAT'S GOING ON

01:51:03.356 --> 01:51:05.125
HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:51:05.191 --> 01:51:07.127
AND A BIG PART OF THAT IS WE'RE

01:51:07.193 --> 01:51:09.496
WONDERING IF GAS PRICES GO UP OR

01:51:09.562 --> 01:51:11.364
INSURANCE PRICES GO UP, WHAT THE

01:51:11.431 --> 01:51:13.133
TRANSPORT OF THOSE GOODS MEAN.

01:51:13.199 --> 01:51:15.835
SO THAT'S MY ONLY HOPE IS ALONG

01:51:15.902 --> 01:51:17.237
THE PATHWAY OF THIS BILL. MAYBE

01:51:17.303 --> 01:51:19.105
WE INCLUDE MORE AS FAR AS WHAT

01:51:19.172 --> 01:51:20.707
EVEN OUR REGULATIONS HERE IN THE

01:51:20.774 --> 01:51:22.809
STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE DOING TO

01:51:22.876 --> 01:51:24.344
IMPACT THE COST ON THE SUPPLY

01:51:24.411 --> 01:51:26.079
CHAIN ACROSS THE BOARD, BECAUSE

01:51:26.146 --> 01:51:27.847
WE KNOW THAT THAT'S IMPACTING

01:51:27.914 --> 01:51:29.015
THE COST, BECAUSE WE HAVE TO

01:51:29.082 --> 01:51:30.517
PASS THOSE COSTS ALONG TO THE

01:51:30.583 --> 01:51:31.785
CONSUMER IN ORDER TO STAY IN

01:51:31.851 --> 01:51:34.120
BUSINESS. SO I REALLY LOOK

01:51:34.187 --> 01:51:35.822
FORWARD TO MAYBE WORKING WITH

01:51:35.889 --> 01:51:37.891
YOU OF HOW WE CAN INSERT THAT,

01:51:37.957 --> 01:51:39.492
BECAUSE OUR FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN

01:51:39.559 --> 01:51:40.593
AND SUPPLY CHAIN IN GENERAL IS

01:51:40.660 --> 01:51:42.062
VITAL TO THE STATE OF

01:51:42.128 --> 01:51:42.862
CALIFORNIA, AND HOW WE CAN MAKE

01:51:42.929 --> 01:51:44.731
SURE THAT THIS STUDY IS TRULY

01:51:44.798 --> 01:51:45.899
IMPACTFUL TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO

01:51:45.965 --> 01:51:46.533
ASSEMBLYMEMBER LOWENTHAL'S POINT

01:51:46.599 --> 01:51:48.034
TO PLAN BEING IN AGRICULTURE

01:51:48.101 --> 01:51:50.303
RIGHT NOW, WE CAN ONLY PLAN

01:51:50.370 --> 01:51:51.271
ABOUT SIX MONTHS AT A TIME. WE

01:51:51.337 --> 01:51:53.006
NO LONGER CAN PLAN A YEAR AHEAD

01:51:53.073 --> 01:51:54.641
OF A TIME, PREDOMINANTLY BECAUSE

01:51:54.707 --> 01:51:56.276
OF THE FLUCTUATING COST OF DOING

01:51:56.342 --> 01:51:56.943
BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. SO THANK

01:51:57.010 --> 01:51:59.045
YOU VERY MUCH. AND IF I MIGHT

01:51:59.112 --> 01:52:00.346
RESPOND THROUGH THE CHAIR, THANK

01:52:00.413 --> 01:52:01.748
YOU, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO

01:52:01.815 --> 01:52:03.249
WORKING WITH YOU. I THINK THAT

01:52:03.316 --> 01:52:04.484
WOULD BE REALLY GOOD. THE

01:52:04.551 --> 01:52:06.186
PERISHABLE ITEMS, I THINK, HAS

01:52:06.252 --> 01:52:07.887
BEEN SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN

01:52:07.954 --> 01:52:09.122
TALKING THROUGH, ESPECIALLY WITH

01:52:09.189 --> 01:52:11.458
THE DIRECTORS AT THE PORT OF

01:52:11.524 --> 01:52:12.625
LONG BEACH ABOUT, AND ACTUALLY

01:52:12.692 --> 01:52:14.060
JUST OVERALL JUST HAVING MORE OF

01:52:14.127 --> 01:52:16.329
A SYNERGY BETWEEN THE PORT

01:52:16.396 --> 01:52:18.231
EXECUTIVES THAT MANY OF US

01:52:18.298 --> 01:52:20.600
REPRESENT ALONG THE COAST, ALONG

01:52:20.667 --> 01:52:22.202
WITH THE AGRICULTURE COMMUNITY.

01:52:22.268 --> 01:52:24.104
I THINK THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT.

01:52:24.170 --> 01:52:25.905
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN HELP YOU

01:52:25.972 --> 01:52:27.807
ON THE REGULATORY ITEMS. I THINK

01:52:27.874 --> 01:52:28.408
THAT'S VERY SEPARATE. I MEAN,

01:52:28.475 --> 01:52:30.410
THIS IS TARIFFS. THESE ARE

01:52:30.477 --> 01:52:31.344
HAPPENING NOW. AND I THINK

01:52:31.411 --> 01:52:32.412
THAT'S WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO

01:52:32.479 --> 01:52:34.581
FOCUS ON IS THE TARIFFS THAT ARE

01:52:34.647 --> 01:52:35.849
LITERALLY MOVING EVERY SINGLE

01:52:35.915 --> 01:52:37.317
MINUTE AND EVERY SECOND OF THE

01:52:37.383 --> 01:52:39.486
DAY THAT ARE CAUSING BILLIONS OF

01:52:39.552 --> 01:52:43.456
DOLLARS IN LOST REVENUE AND

01:52:43.523 --> 01:52:45.758
LAYOFFS AND HIRING FREEZES. AND

01:52:45.825 --> 01:52:47.861
THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT, JUST

01:52:47.927 --> 01:52:48.995
CONSUMER PRICES THAT ARE GOING

01:52:49.062 --> 01:52:50.897
UP DRASTICALLY FOR FOLKS,

01:52:50.964 --> 01:52:53.032
EVERYDAY PEOPLE, I CAN AFFORD

01:52:53.099 --> 01:52:54.934
$20,000 MAYBE IN ADDITION TO MY,

01:52:55.001 --> 01:52:56.903
YOU KNOW, THE NEW CAR I WANT TO

01:52:56.970 --> 01:52:59.272
GET, BUT NOT THE AVERAGE PERSON.

01:52:59.339 --> 01:53:00.640
AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO MAKE

01:53:00.707 --> 01:53:03.009
SURE THAT WE ARE DOING HERE. AND

01:53:03.076 --> 01:53:04.043
AGAIN, THIS IS NOT DOESN'T SEEK

01:53:04.110 --> 01:53:05.478
A SPECIFIC OUTCOME. IT'S OUTCOME

01:53:05.545 --> 01:53:06.913
NEUTRAL. AND SO I THINK THE MORE

01:53:06.980 --> 01:53:08.748
THE MERRIER. I'D LOVE TO WORK

01:53:08.815 --> 01:53:10.984
WITH YOU ON THAT. OVERALL. THANK

01:53:11.050 --> 01:53:15.054

01:53:51.291 --> 01:53:52.892
AS IT'S BEEN NOTED FROM VARIOUS

01:53:52.959 --> 01:53:54.127
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE, WE

01:53:54.194 --> 01:53:56.262

TWO DAYS, THE EXPIRATION ON THE

PAUSE WILL BE. BUT THEN WHEN I

01:54:05.004 --> 01:54:07.140
WAS LISTENING TO THE NEWS THIS

01:54:07.207 --> 01:54:08.641
MORNING, THEY SAID, BUT THE

01:54:08.708 --> 01:54:09.509
PAUSE, EVEN THOUGH IT EXPIRES IN

01:54:09.576 --> 01:54:11.344
TWO DAYS, IT WON'T START UNTIL

01:54:11.411 --> 01:54:13.446
AUGUST 1ST, WHICH IS A LOT OF

01:54:13.513 --> 01:54:14.948
UNCERTAINTY. AND SO THIS WILL

01:54:15.014 --> 01:54:16.849
SHED LIGHT ON THE ECONOMIC

01:54:16.916 --> 01:54:18.618

REGIONAL OPTIMIZATION ACT. SB

01:56:10.863 --> 01:56:13.366

01:56:13.433 --> 01:56:14.834
EXISTING SALES TAX REVENUE FROM

BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD

01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:22.742
BECAUSE IN A STATE THAT'S AS BIG

01:56:22.809 --> 01:56:25.978
AND DYNAMIC AS OURS, WE SHOULD

01:56:26.045 --> 01:56:28.181
HAVE ACCESS TO AIR TRAVEL AND

COMMUNITIES, IT SHOULDN'T AIR

01:56:32.485 --> 01:56:33.920

01:56:35.355 --> 01:56:38.257
LIVE. WE'VE SEEN THIS KIND OF

01:56:38.324 --> 01:56:39.258
NEGLECT BEFORE, WHEN RURAL

01:56:39.325 --> 01:56:40.993
TRANSIT SYSTEMS WERE LEFT

01:56:41.060 --> 01:56:42.161
UNDERFUNDED, WHEN HIGHWAY

01:56:42.228 --> 01:56:43.563
EXPANSION SKIPPED OVER

01:56:43.629 --> 01:56:45.098
COMMUNITIES THAT NEEDED THE

01:56:45.164 --> 01:56:46.799
MOST, AND WHEN SMALLER CITIES

01:56:46.866 --> 01:56:48.401
HAD TO FIGHT JUST TO KEEP A

01:56:48.468 --> 01:56:51.137
SINGLE COMMERCIAL ROUTE. AND NOW

01:56:51.204 --> 01:56:53.573
THOSE SAME COMMUNITIES, GROWING

01:56:53.639 --> 01:56:55.942
COMMUNITIES LIKE MY VERY OWN OF

01:56:56.008 --> 01:56:56.843
THE CITY OF BAKERSFIELD, ARE

01:56:56.909 --> 01:56:58.378
BEING TOLD THAT IF THEY WANT

01:56:58.444 --> 01:57:00.913
AFFORDABLE FLIGHTS OR A NEW

01:57:00.980 --> 01:57:03.015
AIRLINE SERVICE OR UPDATED

01:57:03.082 --> 01:57:04.384
TERMINALS, THEY'LL NEED TO WAIT

01:57:04.450 --> 01:57:06.219
AGAIN. AND THE REALITY IS THAT

01:57:06.285 --> 01:57:08.521
WE NEED TO MODERNIZE AND EMBRACE

01:57:08.588 --> 01:57:10.656
FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF

01:57:10.723 --> 01:57:12.792
AVIATION. I MEAN, I'M JUST

01:57:12.859 --> 01:57:14.560
SHOCKED BY ALL THE ALL THE

01:57:14.627 --> 01:57:16.129
WONDERFUL THINGS THAT ARE THAT

01:57:16.195 --> 01:57:18.197
ARE COMING OUT, AND I'M REALLY

01:57:18.264 --> 01:57:19.399
EXCITED ABOUT IT. AND THAT'S WHY

01:57:19.465 --> 01:57:21.367
I THINK WE ALSO NEED THIS BILL.

01:57:21.434 --> 01:57:23.770
SB 661 SAYS, NO MORE WAITING. I

01:57:23.836 --> 01:57:25.338
WANT TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT

01:57:25.405 --> 01:57:29.375
SB 661 IS NOT A NEW TAX. IT

01:57:29.442 --> 01:57:30.676
REESTABLISHES A DEDICATED

01:57:30.743 --> 01:57:32.111
FUNDING STREAM FOR CALIFORNIA

01:57:32.178 --> 01:57:35.114
AIRPORTS BY USING EXISTING JET

01:57:35.181 --> 01:57:38.017
FUEL SALES TAX REVENUE. REVENUE

01:57:38.084 --> 01:57:39.786
ALREADY GENERATED AT OUR

01:57:39.852 --> 01:57:41.220
AIRPORTS TO INVEST BACK INTO OUR

01:57:41.287 --> 01:57:43.356
AIRPORT INFRASTRUCTURE, AIR

01:57:43.423 --> 01:57:44.724
SERVICE EXPANSION AND OTHER

01:57:44.791 --> 01:57:46.359
AVIATION RELATED PURPOSES LIKE

01:57:46.426 --> 01:57:48.494
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FOR THE

01:57:48.561 --> 01:57:49.562
CENTRAL VALLEY AND RURAL

01:57:49.629 --> 01:57:50.963
COMMUNITIES. THIS MEANS SHORTER

01:57:51.030 --> 01:57:52.665
COMMUTES TO ACCESS FLIGHTS AND

01:57:52.732 --> 01:57:54.667
MEANS BETTER INFRASTRUCTURE TO

01:57:54.734 --> 01:57:56.102
SUPPORT CARGO AND COMMERCE. IT

01:57:56.169 --> 01:57:58.171
MEANS JOBS AND AVIATION,

01:57:58.237 --> 01:57:59.906
LOGISTICS, HOSPITALITY AND OTHER

01:57:59.972 --> 01:58:02.108
RELATED INDUSTRIES THAT DON'T

01:58:02.175 --> 01:58:04.944
REQUIRE LEAVING TOWN. SO FOR

01:58:05.011 --> 01:58:06.112
CALIFORNIA AS A WHOLE, IT MEANS

01:58:06.179 --> 01:58:08.214
A MORE RESILIENT, BALANCED

01:58:08.281 --> 01:58:09.649
TRANSPORTATION NETWORK WITH AN

01:58:09.715 --> 01:58:11.050
AIRPORT SYSTEM THAT WORKS

01:58:11.117 --> 01:58:13.352
TOGETHER, ONE WHERE NO SINGLE

01:58:13.419 --> 01:58:14.287
REGION SHOULDERS, THAT WEIGHT,

01:58:14.353 --> 01:58:16.522
AND NO COMMUNITY IS LEFT BEHIND.

01:58:16.589 --> 01:58:18.724
I ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT SB 661

01:58:18.791 --> 01:58:20.426
IS A CRITICAL STEP TOWARD

01:58:20.493 --> 01:58:21.761
BRINGING CALIFORNIA INTO LONG

01:58:21.828 --> 01:58:23.763
OVERDUE COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL

01:58:23.830 --> 01:58:25.932
LAW, WHICH REQUIRES THAT

01:58:25.998 --> 01:58:27.567
REVENUES FROM AVIATION FUEL

01:58:27.633 --> 01:58:30.136
TAXES BE USED EXCLUSIVELY FOR

01:58:30.203 --> 01:58:31.571
AIRPORT RELATED PURPOSES AND

01:58:31.637 --> 01:58:33.840
STATE AVIATION PROGRAMS. FOR

01:58:33.906 --> 01:58:36.642
OVER A DECADE, CALIFORNIA HAS

01:58:36.709 --> 01:58:38.478
REMAINED OUT OF ALIGNMENT WITH

01:58:38.544 --> 01:58:39.579
THIS MANDATE, PUTTING THE STATE

01:58:39.645 --> 01:58:43.082
AT SERIOUS RISK. AND UNDER THE

01:58:43.149 --> 01:58:44.484
CURRENT FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION,

01:58:44.550 --> 01:58:46.319
THE FAA HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT

01:58:46.385 --> 01:58:48.154
CONTINUED NONCOMPLIANCE COULD

01:58:48.221 --> 01:58:50.656
RESULT IN THE LOSS OF VITAL

01:58:50.723 --> 01:58:52.191
FEDERAL FUNDING AND EVEN LEGAL

01:58:52.258 --> 01:58:53.960
ACTION BY THE US ATTORNEY'S

01:58:54.026 --> 01:58:57.096
OFFICE. SB 661 NOT ONLY HELPS

01:58:57.163 --> 01:58:58.631
RESOLVE THIS LONG STANDING

01:58:58.698 --> 01:58:59.699
DISPUTE WITH THE FEDERAL

01:58:59.765 --> 01:59:01.501
GOVERNMENT, IT HELPS PROTECT IT.

01:59:01.567 --> 01:59:03.703
IT ALSO SUPPORTS CALIFORNIA'S

01:59:03.769 --> 01:59:05.104
TRANSPORTATION GOALS AND

01:59:05.171 --> 01:59:06.672
COMPLEMENTS OUR CLIMATE EFFORTS.

01:59:06.739 --> 01:59:07.974
AND LASTLY, I WANT TO

01:59:08.040 --> 01:59:09.141
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE ARE WORKING

01:59:09.208 --> 01:59:11.544
WITH AIRPORT STAKEHOLDERS ON THE

01:59:11.611 --> 01:59:12.945
FORMULA TO ADJUST THE FUNDING

01:59:13.012 --> 01:59:14.780
DISTRIBUTION SO THAT IT IS SO

01:59:14.847 --> 01:59:16.983
THAT IT IS EQUITABLE AND BETTER

01:59:17.049 --> 01:59:18.885
SERVES THE NEEDS OF ALL AIRPORTS

01:59:18.951 --> 01:59:21.420
AND THEIR DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS. I

01:59:21.487 --> 01:59:23.055
APPRECIATE THE INPUT RECEIVED BY

01:59:23.122 --> 01:59:24.056
THE STAKEHOLDERS, AND WE ARE

01:59:24.123 --> 01:59:25.958
VERY OPTIMISTIC THAT WE WILL

01:59:26.025 --> 01:59:27.760
LAND ON A SET OF AMENDMENTS THAT

01:59:27.827 --> 01:59:29.896
WE ALL CAN AGREE ON. SO WITH ME

01:59:29.962 --> 01:59:32.365
TODAY, I HAVE JIM LIGHTS,

01:59:32.431 --> 01:59:33.533
REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA

01:59:33.599 --> 01:59:35.535
AIRPORT COUNCIL, WHO HAS BEEN

01:59:35.601 --> 01:59:38.004
WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS

01:59:38.070 --> 01:59:41.541
BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON, MADAM

01:59:41.607 --> 01:59:43.276
CHAIR AND MEMBERS. JIM LIGHTS,

01:59:43.342 --> 01:59:44.777
ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:59:44.844 --> 01:59:46.579
AIRPORTS COUNCIL, I'D LIKE TO

01:59:46.646 --> 01:59:47.880
REALLY UNDERSCORE ONE OF THE

01:59:47.947 --> 01:59:50.116
THINGS THAT SENATOR HURTADO SAID

01:59:50.182 --> 01:59:52.351
THE MOST IMPORTANT PORTION OF

01:59:52.418 --> 01:59:54.487
THIS BILL IS SECTION THREE,

01:59:54.554 --> 01:59:56.923
WHICH MOVES CALIFORNIA INTO

01:59:56.989 --> 01:59:59.158
COMPLIANCE ON THE REVENUE USE

01:59:59.225 --> 02:00:02.528
RULE THE FAA PUTS FORWARD FOR

02:00:02.595 --> 02:00:04.397
TAX REVENUES GENERATED FROM THE

02:00:04.463 --> 02:00:08.401
SALE OF AVIATION FUELS. WE ARE

02:00:08.467 --> 02:00:11.337
ALMOST 11 YEARS AFTER THE FAA

02:00:11.404 --> 02:00:13.172
NOTIFIED THE STATE THAT WE ARE

02:00:13.239 --> 02:00:15.007
NOT IN COMPLIANCE, AND WE ARE

02:00:15.074 --> 02:00:17.109
STILL NOT IN COMPLIANCE. THIS

02:00:17.176 --> 02:00:18.878
BILL WILL TAKE CARE OF THAT

02:00:18.945 --> 02:00:20.413
PROBLEM. AT THE END OF THE DAY,

02:00:20.479 --> 02:00:22.782
IT WILL GENERATE FUNDS FOR ALL

02:00:22.848 --> 02:00:24.417
AIRPORTS, BOTH COMMERCIAL AND

02:00:24.483 --> 02:00:27.186
GENERAL AVIATION AIRPORTS. AND

02:00:27.253 --> 02:00:29.655
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'D LIKE

02:00:29.722 --> 02:00:31.123
TO UNDERSCORE IS, I THINK

02:00:31.190 --> 02:00:32.792
JANUARY SHOWED US THAT WE NEVER

02:00:32.858 --> 02:00:34.493
KNOW WHICH AIRPORTS ARE GOING TO

02:00:34.560 --> 02:00:37.229
BE CALLED UPON TO SUPPORT AERIAL

02:00:37.296 --> 02:00:39.131
FIREFIGHTING. AND SO WE NEED TO

02:00:39.198 --> 02:00:41.601
MAKE SURE THAT OUR AVIATION

02:00:41.667 --> 02:00:44.503
INFRASTRUCTURE IS READY TO GO

02:00:44.570 --> 02:00:46.606
STATEWIDE, NOT JUST IN THE RURAL

02:00:46.672 --> 02:00:49.642
AREAS WHERE A FIRE MAY OCCUR. SO

02:00:49.709 --> 02:00:50.943
WITH THAT, WE ARE IN STRONG

02:00:51.010 --> 02:00:52.745
SUPPORT AND VERY OPTIMISTIC THAT

02:00:52.812 --> 02:00:54.580
WE WILL COME UP WITH AN

02:00:54.647 --> 02:00:56.382
EXPENDITURE ALLOCATION FORMULA

02:00:56.449 --> 02:00:59.118
THAT WILL BE COMFORTABLE FOR THE

02:00:59.185 --> 02:01:02.221
TAXPAYERS IN THIS DISCUSSION AS

02:01:02.288 --> 02:01:05.625
WELL AS THE AIRPORTS. THANK YOU.

02:01:05.691 --> 02:01:07.426

ASSOCIATION AS THE TAXPAYER AS

02:01:18.371 --> 02:01:21.340
WE WERE REFERRED TO. WE DO HAVE

02:01:21.407 --> 02:01:23.876
A VERY KEEN INTEREST IN THIS

02:01:23.943 --> 02:01:26.278
BILL. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH

02:01:26.345 --> 02:01:28.981
THE AIRPORTS COUNCIL FOR ABOUT A

02:01:29.048 --> 02:01:32.451
DECADE NOW TO REALLY TRY TO PUSH

02:01:32.518 --> 02:01:33.052
TOWARDS THIS DIRECTION, AND

02:01:33.119 --> 02:01:34.520
WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE

02:01:34.587 --> 02:01:37.623
SENATOR FOR TAKING THIS ON AND

02:01:37.690 --> 02:01:40.960
ADVANCING THIS AS A TAXPAYER. WE

02:01:41.027 --> 02:01:44.263
ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE,

02:01:44.330 --> 02:01:46.365
THE, THE DISTRIBUTION OF THESE

02:01:46.432 --> 02:01:48.334
REVENUES, AS MUCH OF IT GOES

02:01:48.401 --> 02:01:50.870
BACK TO THE AIRPORT OF ORIGIN AS

02:01:50.936 --> 02:01:51.637
POSSIBLE. WE'RE WORKING WITH

02:01:51.704 --> 02:01:54.173
SENATOR AND HER STAFF ON ON WHAT

02:01:54.240 --> 02:01:56.542
THIS WOULD LOOK LIKE. BUT WE DO

02:01:56.609 --> 02:01:59.011
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT, YOU

02:01:59.078 --> 02:02:00.379
KNOW, THE CUSTOMER'S NEEDS ARE

02:02:00.446 --> 02:02:02.214
MET, HEALTH AND SAFETY

02:02:02.281 --> 02:02:03.616
STANDARDS, PUBLIC SAFETY

02:02:03.683 --> 02:02:05.184
STANDARDS, EVERYTHING THAT GOES

02:02:05.251 --> 02:02:06.952
INTO THE OPERATIONS OF RUNNING

02:02:07.019 --> 02:02:09.889
AN AIRPORT, RUNNING AN AIRLINE,

02:02:09.955 --> 02:02:12.992

02:02:13.059 --> 02:02:15.127
POSITIVE EXPERIENCE AS POSSIBLE.

02:02:15.194 --> 02:02:16.729
THIS BILL WILL GO A LONG WAY TO

02:02:16.796 --> 02:02:19.198
RETURNING A LOT OF THESE FUNDS

02:02:19.265 --> 02:02:21.333
TO THE AIRPORTS, AS OPPOSED TO

02:02:21.400 --> 02:02:23.836
THE STATE GENERAL FUND. WE HAVE

02:02:23.903 --> 02:02:26.005
BEEN VERY FRUSTRATED. THAT

02:02:26.072 --> 02:02:27.873
HASN'T HAPPENED YET. SO WE'RE

02:02:27.940 --> 02:02:30.409
WE'RE GRATEFUL. AND WE ALSO

02:02:30.476 --> 02:02:33.112

SOON. AND SO WITH THE CAVEAT

02:02:44.023 --> 02:02:46.459

02:03:52.124 --> 02:03:53.859
MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC WHO WOULD

02:03:53.926 --> 02:03:55.628
LIKE TO NOTE THEIR OPPOSITION

02:03:55.694 --> 02:03:58.597
NAME, ORGANIZATION AND POSITION.

02:03:58.664 --> 02:04:01.534
SEEING NONE. MOVING TO MEMBERS

02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:03.536
OF THE COMMITTEE. ROGERS. THANK

02:04:03.602 --> 02:04:05.504
YOU, SENATOR. SO I JUST WANTED A

02:04:05.571 --> 02:04:06.839
QUICK CLARIFICATION, IF I COULD,

02:04:06.906 --> 02:04:08.641
BECAUSE WHAT I HEARD FROM THE

02:04:08.707 --> 02:04:10.709
SENATOR WAS THAT PART OF THIS

02:04:10.776 --> 02:04:12.812
REALIGNMENT WOULD BETTER SUPPORT

02:04:12.878 --> 02:04:14.713
AIRPORTS IN RURAL AREAS. I HEARD

02:04:14.780 --> 02:04:17.116
FROM ONE WITNESS THAT DURING THE

02:04:17.183 --> 02:04:19.051
FIREFIGHTING, ALL OF THE

02:04:19.118 --> 02:04:21.220
AIRPORTS WERE CALLED UPON AND

02:04:21.287 --> 02:04:22.388
THAT WE NEED TO INVEST IN, IN,

02:04:22.454 --> 02:04:25.157
IN OUR RURAL AND SMALL AIRPORTS.

02:04:25.224 --> 02:04:26.926
BUT THEN FROM ANOTHER WITNESS, I

02:04:26.992 --> 02:04:28.427
HEARD AS MANY DOLLARS GOING BACK

02:04:28.494 --> 02:04:30.162
TO THE POINT OF ORIGIN, WHICH

02:04:30.229 --> 02:04:32.932
SEEMS TO BENEFIT THE BIG AIR

02:04:32.998 --> 02:04:34.867
AIRPORTS CURRENTLY. SO GIVEN

02:04:34.934 --> 02:04:36.535
THAT ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT

02:04:36.602 --> 02:04:37.803
ISN'T BEING ANSWERED RIGHT NOW

02:04:37.870 --> 02:04:39.872
AND HEARING OF THIS BILL IS THE

02:04:39.939 --> 02:04:40.973
NEGOTIATIONS ABOUT WHERE THAT

02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:42.741
PERCENTAGE FORMULA WILL COME

02:04:42.808 --> 02:04:44.844
DOWN, MY QUESTION REALLY IS WHAT

02:04:44.910 --> 02:04:46.779
IS THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL OTHER

02:04:46.846 --> 02:04:49.281
THAN JUST REALIGNING THE DOLLARS

02:04:49.348 --> 02:04:51.584
FROM THE GENERAL FUND BACK TO

02:04:51.650 --> 02:04:53.519
AIRPORTS? IS THE PURPOSE OF THE

02:04:53.586 --> 02:04:56.755
BILL TO SUPPORT RURAL AND SMALL

02:04:56.822 --> 02:04:59.325
AIRPORTS AS WELL, OR IS IT TO

02:04:59.391 --> 02:05:00.759
REALIGN THE DOLLARS SO THAT THEY

02:05:00.826 --> 02:05:03.896
GO BACK TO THE AREA WHERE THE

02:05:03.963 --> 02:05:08.167
JET FUEL IS BEING SOLD?

02:05:08.234 --> 02:05:09.835
RESPONSE-GOVERNORS ON? AND SO I

02:05:09.902 --> 02:05:11.937
CAN RESPOND TO THAT. AND IF MY

02:05:12.004 --> 02:05:13.105
WITNESSES WOULD LIKE TO ADD, I,

02:05:13.172 --> 02:05:17.243
I THEY SURE. WHAT I'LL ANSWER

02:05:17.309 --> 02:05:20.546
THROUGH THE CHAIR IS THAT. YES.

02:05:20.613 --> 02:05:22.248
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY I REPRESENT A

02:05:22.314 --> 02:05:24.350
RURAL COMMUNITY AND THE GOAL IS

02:05:24.416 --> 02:05:26.218
TO ENSURE THAT THESE FUNDS ARE

02:05:26.285 --> 02:05:28.420
ABLE TO GO BACK TO THOSE

02:05:28.487 --> 02:05:30.189
COMMUNITIES. AND RIGHT NOW

02:05:30.256 --> 02:05:33.826
THEY'RE NOT. AND SO I, YOU KNOW,

02:05:33.893 --> 02:05:36.028
I DRIVE BY ALL THE TIME BY MY

02:05:36.095 --> 02:05:36.929
BAKERSFIELD AIRPORT. AND THAT'S

02:05:36.996 --> 02:05:38.764
REALLY WHAT DROVE ME TO DRAFT

02:05:38.831 --> 02:05:41.734
THIS BILL IN THE FIRST PLACE. I

02:05:41.800 --> 02:05:44.403
THERE IT NEEDS IT NEEDS TO BE

02:05:44.470 --> 02:05:46.372
MODERNIZED. IT NEEDS FINANCIAL

02:05:46.438 --> 02:05:48.908
SUPPORT. THERE'S EXISTING

02:05:48.974 --> 02:05:50.309
REVENUES THAT SHOULD BE GOING TO

02:05:50.376 --> 02:05:54.280
IT AND ARE NOT. AND I THINK THAT

02:05:54.346 --> 02:05:56.215
THAT WE THAT THAT IT NEEDS TO

02:05:56.282 --> 02:05:57.616
HAPPEN. RIGHT. THE MONEY NEEDS

02:05:57.683 --> 02:06:00.019
TO COME BACK. BUT YES, IT DOES

02:06:00.085 --> 02:06:02.588
SUPPORT OTHER AIRPORTS AS WELL.

02:06:02.655 --> 02:06:04.690
AND I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, PART

02:06:04.757 --> 02:06:06.625
OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT IF WE

02:06:06.692 --> 02:06:08.360
FOCUS ON ONE AND NOT THE OTHER,

02:06:08.427 --> 02:06:10.329
THEN I THINK THERE'D BE OTHER

02:06:10.396 --> 02:06:12.131
OTHER FOLKS THAT WOULD BE LIKE,

02:06:12.197 --> 02:06:13.966
HEY, I WANT MY FAIR SHARE AS

02:06:14.033 --> 02:06:14.934
WELL. AND THAT'S AND THAT'S

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:16.435
WHERE WE'RE AT. THIS IS ABOUT

02:06:16.502 --> 02:06:18.904
COMING TOGETHER, TRYING TO

02:06:18.971 --> 02:06:21.440
ADDRESS A NEED. YES, THERE'S A

02:06:21.507 --> 02:06:22.875
SIGNIFICANT NEED IN RURAL

02:06:22.942 --> 02:06:24.109
COMMUNITIES, BUT THERE'S ALSO A

02:06:24.176 --> 02:06:28.047
NEED IN IN URBAN COMMUNITIES AS

02:06:28.113 --> 02:06:32.885
WELL. WE HAVE A MOTION BY

02:06:32.952 --> 02:06:35.721
MACEDO. ANY DO WE HAVE A SECOND

02:06:35.788 --> 02:06:37.890
AARON. SECOND BY AARON'S.

02:06:37.957 --> 02:06:39.925
ALRIGHTY. I WANTED TO CONTINUE

02:06:39.992 --> 02:06:41.727
WITH ROGERS. YEAH. I WAS GOING

02:06:41.794 --> 02:06:43.062
TO SAY I'M NOT SURE THAT

02:06:43.128 --> 02:06:44.863
EVERYBODY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO

02:06:44.930 --> 02:06:45.831
ANSWER THAT QUESTION. I, I'M

02:06:45.898 --> 02:06:47.366
HAPPY TO JUMP IN SINCE I'M THE

02:06:47.433 --> 02:06:48.901
ONE THAT SORT OF THREW THE, THE,

02:06:48.968 --> 02:06:51.236
THE MONKEY WRENCH INTO THE WHEEL

02:06:51.303 --> 02:06:54.373
HERE. I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT MY

02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:56.308
COMMENTS TO BE INTERPRETED. AS,

02:06:56.375 --> 02:06:58.310
YOU KNOW, THE SMALLER AIRPORTS

02:06:58.377 --> 02:07:01.613
SHOULDN'T GET REVENUES UNDER THE

02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:04.116
BILL, NO MATTER WHAT. THEY ARE

02:07:04.183 --> 02:07:05.250
GOING TO GET MORE MONEY THAN

02:07:05.317 --> 02:07:06.785
THEY'RE CURRENTLY GETTING

02:07:06.852 --> 02:07:09.254
BECAUSE THIS MONEY IS HAS BEEN

02:07:09.321 --> 02:07:11.290
DIVERTED FOR YEARS. THE

02:07:11.357 --> 02:07:13.525
REGULATION ACTUALLY WENT INTO

02:07:13.592 --> 02:07:16.962
EFFECT IN 1983, AND THEN THE

02:07:17.029 --> 02:07:18.530
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAID, WELL,

02:07:18.597 --> 02:07:20.499
YOU KNOW, IT'S 1989, WE REALLY

02:07:20.566 --> 02:07:21.967
WANT YOU TO DO THIS. SO WE'RE

02:07:22.034 --> 02:07:24.737
GOING TO LET YOU KEEP WHAT YOU

02:07:24.803 --> 02:07:25.504
GOT RIGHT NOW, WHATEVER TAXES

02:07:25.571 --> 02:07:26.905
ARE IMPOSED AND YOU CAN, YOU

02:07:26.972 --> 02:07:28.240
KNOW, JUST THE REST WOULD HAVE

02:07:28.307 --> 02:07:30.109
TO GO BACK TO THE AIRPORTS. THAT

02:07:30.175 --> 02:07:32.411
NEVER HAPPENED EITHER. SO THERE

02:07:32.478 --> 02:07:34.446
IS MONEY THAT, FRANKLY, FOR

02:07:34.513 --> 02:07:35.547
DECADES HAS BEEN GOING INTO THE

02:07:35.614 --> 02:07:37.983
GENERAL FUND WHERE IT REALLY

02:07:38.050 --> 02:07:39.752
DIDN'T BELONG. THERE MIGHT BE

02:07:39.818 --> 02:07:40.853
SOME LEGITIMATE USES, BUT FOR

02:07:40.919 --> 02:07:42.888
THE MOST PART, NOT SO MUCH. BUT

02:07:42.955 --> 02:07:44.523
THE SMALLER AIRPORTS WILL GET

02:07:44.590 --> 02:07:47.226
MORE REVENUES. WHETHER YOU HAVE

02:07:47.292 --> 02:07:49.728
A 50% ALLOCATION GOING DIRECTLY

02:07:49.795 --> 02:07:51.096
BACK TO THE AIRPORT OF ORIGIN

02:07:51.163 --> 02:07:53.032
AND THEN SOME COMBINATION OF

02:07:53.098 --> 02:07:54.800
OTHER, YOU KNOW, LARGE HUB,

02:07:54.867 --> 02:07:56.201
MEDIUM HUB, NON HUBS AND SO

02:07:56.268 --> 02:07:57.903
FORTH. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING

02:07:57.970 --> 02:07:59.838
ON RIGHT NOW, IS TO TRY TO GET

02:07:59.905 --> 02:08:02.174
THAT BALANCE RIGHT, TO MAKE SURE

02:08:02.241 --> 02:08:03.776
THAT THE SMALLER AIRPORTS,

02:08:03.842 --> 02:08:07.780
WHETHER THEY'RE IN SANTA ROSA OR

02:08:07.846 --> 02:08:09.348
FRESNO OR WHEREVER, THAT THEY

02:08:09.415 --> 02:08:11.483
ARE GETTING A FAIR SHARE. WE'RE

02:08:11.550 --> 02:08:13.886
NOT LOOKING TO MOVE EVERYTHING

02:08:13.952 --> 02:08:15.387
TO THE LARGE AIRPORTS. THAT

02:08:15.454 --> 02:08:17.056
DOESN'T BENEFIT UNITED AIRLINES

02:08:17.122 --> 02:08:19.792
OR THE OTHER AIRLINES AS WELL.

02:08:19.858 --> 02:08:21.093
SO WE'RE JUST WORKING ON THOSE

02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:23.128
FINE POINTS. I APPRECIATE THAT,

02:08:23.195 --> 02:08:24.897
AND THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO HONE

02:08:24.963 --> 02:08:27.166
IN ON IT A LITTLE BIT IS, AGAIN,

02:08:27.232 --> 02:08:28.700
ALSO REPRESENT A RURAL

02:08:28.767 --> 02:08:31.970
COMMUNITY. AND THE WAY THAT WE

02:08:32.037 --> 02:08:34.473
SEE GAS TAX ALLOCATION FOR ROAD

02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:36.542
DEVELOPMENT ALREADY IS A

02:08:36.608 --> 02:08:38.877
CHALLENGE COMPARED TO OTHER

02:08:38.944 --> 02:08:40.946
PLACES THAT HAVE MORE

02:08:41.013 --> 02:08:42.548
POPULATION. AND I WOULD JUST

02:08:42.614 --> 02:08:43.782
HATE TO SEE US MAKE THIS SHIFT.

02:08:43.849 --> 02:08:46.685
WHERE THEN ALSO AIR TRAVEL IS A

02:08:46.752 --> 02:08:48.187
SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE FOR RURAL

02:08:48.253 --> 02:08:49.121
COMMUNITIES RELATIVE TO OTHER

02:08:49.188 --> 02:08:50.989
PARTS OF THE STATE AS WELL. SO I

02:08:51.056 --> 02:08:53.325
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I HEARD

02:08:53.392 --> 02:08:54.560
CLEARLY FROM THE AUTHOR WHAT THE

02:08:54.626 --> 02:08:58.597
INTENT WAS OF THE BILL. ASSEMBLY

02:08:58.664 --> 02:09:01.533
MEMBER WARD. THANK YOU. JUST SO

02:09:01.600 --> 02:09:03.102
I WANT TO GET CLARIFICATION, I

02:09:03.168 --> 02:09:04.570
THINK, ON SEVERAL THINGS THAT I

02:09:04.636 --> 02:09:06.572
THINK ARE KIND OF INTEGRATED IN

02:09:06.638 --> 02:09:07.840
THE DISCUSSION HERE SO THAT WE

02:09:07.906 --> 02:09:08.941
KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING

02:09:09.007 --> 02:09:10.342
AT. SO THERE IS THE EXISTING

02:09:10.409 --> 02:09:13.045
FUEL EXCISE TAX OF $0.18 PER

02:09:13.112 --> 02:09:16.048
GALLON, AS WELL AS THE EXISTING

02:09:16.115 --> 02:09:17.983
$0.02 PER GALLON ON AIRCRAFT JET

02:09:18.050 --> 02:09:20.419
FUEL. AND THAT I THINK IS LAST

02:09:20.486 --> 02:09:23.489
BEEN UPDATED IN 1994. ACCORDING

02:09:23.555 --> 02:09:25.023
TO OUR ANALYSIS, THAT'S NEVER

02:09:25.090 --> 02:09:27.893
BEEN ESCALATED TO ADJUST FOR

02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:29.194
INFLATION OR THAT THAT NUMBER

02:09:29.261 --> 02:09:31.029
HAS NEVER BEEN ADJUSTED. BUT SO

02:09:31.096 --> 02:09:32.464
LET'S LET'S KIND OF PUT THAT ON

02:09:32.531 --> 02:09:35.701
ON THE BOARD. THE FAA IS

02:09:35.767 --> 02:09:37.870
COMPLAINT AND THE, THE, THE

02:09:37.936 --> 02:09:39.271
BELIEF THAT THERE HAS BEEN OR

02:09:39.338 --> 02:09:41.206
I'M SURE THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT

02:09:41.273 --> 02:09:42.541
THE, THE DEMONSTRATION THAT

02:09:42.608 --> 02:09:44.643
THERE'S BEEN MOVEMENT OF MONEY

02:09:44.710 --> 02:09:45.711
FROM THE AVIATION FUND INTO THE

02:09:45.777 --> 02:09:48.280
GENERAL FUND. THE ANALYSIS IS

02:09:48.347 --> 02:09:50.182
ALSO TELLING US THAT THIS IS

02:09:50.249 --> 02:09:51.517
POTENTIALLY BEEN RECTIFIED AND

02:09:51.583 --> 02:09:54.820
THAT SINCE 2020, CDTFA HAS BEEN

02:09:54.887 --> 02:09:56.522
RECEIVING INFORMATION ABOUT

02:09:56.588 --> 02:09:58.357
REVENUES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE

02:09:58.423 --> 02:10:00.559
FAA POLICY. SO IS IT YOUR

02:10:00.626 --> 02:10:01.627
TESTIMONY THAT WE'RE STILL NOT

02:10:01.693 --> 02:10:02.928
IN COMPLIANCE? BECAUSE I WOULD

02:10:02.995 --> 02:10:04.730
HAVE HOPED THAT THAT ANALYSIS,

02:10:04.796 --> 02:10:06.365
THAT DIRECTIVE THAT STARTED BACK

02:10:06.431 --> 02:10:09.134
IN BACK IN 2020, WOULD HAVE

02:10:09.201 --> 02:10:11.403
HELPED TO SHOW US WHAT WE NEED

02:10:11.470 --> 02:10:12.804
TO BE PRESERVING INTO THAT

02:10:12.871 --> 02:10:16.341
ACCOUNT. RIGHT. SO IN A 2019

02:10:16.408 --> 02:10:19.111
BUDGET TRAILER BILL, FINANCE

02:10:19.178 --> 02:10:21.013
REQUIRED FUEL SELLERS WHEN THEY

02:10:21.079 --> 02:10:23.448
REMIT THEIR SALES TAXES TO

02:10:23.515 --> 02:10:24.683
SUBMIT AN ADDITIONAL SHEET SO WE

02:10:24.750 --> 02:10:26.852
COULD BEGIN TO TRACK HOW MUCH

02:10:26.919 --> 02:10:28.587
MONEY WE'RE ACTUALLY TALKING

02:10:28.654 --> 02:10:30.255
ABOUT. SO THAT STARTED IN THE

02:10:30.322 --> 02:10:32.958
FIRST QUARTER OF 2020. SO WE

02:10:33.025 --> 02:10:34.393
KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY WE'RE

02:10:34.459 --> 02:10:36.128
TALKING ABOUT. NONE OF IT HAS

02:10:36.195 --> 02:10:38.397
BEEN REALLOCATED TO AN AVIATION

02:10:38.463 --> 02:10:40.999
PURPOSE, HOWEVER. I MEAN, THAT

02:10:41.066 --> 02:10:41.867
CERTAINLY IS SOMETHING THAT

02:10:41.934 --> 02:10:43.569
WOULD BE APT FOR A BUDGET

02:10:43.635 --> 02:10:45.904
COMMITTEE CONVERSATION AS WELL,

02:10:45.971 --> 02:10:48.440
THAT I SIT ON THAT, YOU KNOW, IS

02:10:48.507 --> 02:10:49.041
DISAPPOINTING THAT, YOU KNOW,

02:10:49.107 --> 02:10:51.677
THIS HASN'T COME UP. I HAVE NOT

02:10:51.743 --> 02:10:52.211
SEEN THAT COME UP BEFORE,

02:10:52.277 --> 02:10:54.012
BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I

02:10:54.079 --> 02:10:56.014
WOULD LIKE TO US TO SORT OF

02:10:56.081 --> 02:10:58.116
MAKE, BE CONSISTENT WITH. AND I

02:10:58.183 --> 02:11:00.052
THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

02:11:00.118 --> 02:11:01.320
WE'D, WE'D WANT TO BE FAITHFUL

02:11:01.386 --> 02:11:02.854
WITH IN MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE

02:11:02.921 --> 02:11:03.889
PRESERVING A LOT OF THOSE

02:11:03.956 --> 02:11:05.357
DOLLARS. NOW, THAT'S THE FUEL

02:11:05.424 --> 02:11:08.827
EXCISE TAX AND THE, THE $0.02 ON

02:11:08.894 --> 02:11:10.796
AIRCRAFT JET FUEL. SO THOSE,

02:11:10.862 --> 02:11:12.631
THOSE THAT $0.18 AND THAT $0.02

02:11:12.698 --> 02:11:14.399
THERE. BUT ARE WE ALSO SAYING

02:11:14.466 --> 02:11:16.868
THAT THE SALES AND USE TAX IS

02:11:16.935 --> 02:11:20.339
ALSO SUBJECT TO THE FAA'S

02:11:20.405 --> 02:11:21.873
ORDERS, BECAUSE THAT IS A

02:11:21.940 --> 02:11:24.343
GENERAL TAX, RIGHT? ANY TAX THAT

02:11:24.409 --> 02:11:27.646
WAS APPLIED, I BELIEVE, AFTER

02:11:27.713 --> 02:11:30.949
1986 IS SUBJECT TO THIS RULE.

02:11:31.016 --> 02:11:32.784
AND SO WE DID HAVE A SALES TAX

02:11:32.851 --> 02:11:35.320
IN PLACE PRIOR TO THAT. IT HAS

02:11:35.387 --> 02:11:38.390
GONE UP, OF COURSE, SINCE 1986.

02:11:38.457 --> 02:11:40.926
THIS INCLUDES A LOCAL REGIONAL

02:11:40.993 --> 02:11:44.162
VOTER APPROVED SALES TAX ADD ONS

02:11:44.229 --> 02:11:46.465
FOR DEDICATED PURPOSES. THEY'RE

02:11:46.531 --> 02:11:50.602
ALL SUBJECT TO THIS RULE. AND SO

02:11:50.669 --> 02:11:52.271
THAT'S WHY IT'S NOT THE FULL

02:11:52.337 --> 02:11:56.208
SALES TAX AMOUNT THAT IS SUBJECT

02:11:56.275 --> 02:11:58.810
TO THE REALLOCATION. RIGHT. JUST

02:11:58.877 --> 02:12:04.449
THE 3.9375%. RIGHT. MY CONCERN

02:12:04.516 --> 02:12:06.218
IS WHEN WE GET INTO THAT THAT SO

02:12:06.285 --> 02:12:08.687
A COUPLE OF THINGS. IF YOU'RE

02:12:08.754 --> 02:12:12.324
MOVING. I SEE ON HIS FACE AND I

02:12:12.391 --> 02:12:14.059
THINK I HAVE SOME MORE RESEARCH

02:12:14.126 --> 02:12:15.894
I WOULD NEED TO DO IN THIS. AND

02:12:15.961 --> 02:12:18.630
I'M HAPPY TO GIVE IT A

02:12:18.697 --> 02:12:19.298
SUPPORTIVE VOTE HERE TODAY. BUT

02:12:19.364 --> 02:12:20.299
I WOULD UNDERSTAND BETWEEN THE

02:12:20.365 --> 02:12:22.367
FUEL EXCISE TAX AND THE TAX ON

02:12:22.434 --> 02:12:23.335
AIRCRAFT JET FUEL, THAT THAT

02:12:23.402 --> 02:12:25.203
REALLY SHOULD BE LOCKBOX THERE

02:12:25.270 --> 02:12:26.038
FOR AVIATION PURPOSES AND THAT

02:12:26.104 --> 02:12:29.241
WE SHOULD BE WE SHOULD BE

02:12:29.308 --> 02:12:31.576
FAITHFUL TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE

02:12:31.643 --> 02:12:33.078
THAT'S NOT RAIDED ON ON THE

02:12:33.145 --> 02:12:35.814
SALES AND USE TAX. THIS I THINK

02:12:35.881 --> 02:12:37.082
YOUR SENATE APPROPRIATIONS

02:12:37.149 --> 02:12:37.849
COMMITTEE IS ACKNOWLEDGING THIS

02:12:37.916 --> 02:12:40.585
WOULD BE A SHIFT OF MORE THAN

02:12:40.652 --> 02:12:42.087
$54 MILLION NOW, AND THAT COMES

02:12:42.154 --> 02:12:45.123
OUT OF, I ASSUME, COUNTY FUNDS

02:12:45.190 --> 02:12:47.025
OR OTHER OTHER. THERE'S THE

02:12:47.092 --> 02:12:48.226
STATE PORTION. THERE IS THE

02:12:48.293 --> 02:12:49.594
COUNTIES PORTION THAT THAT

02:12:49.661 --> 02:12:51.630
SOMEHOW IS GOING TO COME AT THE

02:12:51.697 --> 02:12:52.898
COST OF SOMETHING ELSE WHEN AT

02:12:52.964 --> 02:12:54.533
THE SAME TIME, WHILE I KNOW

02:12:54.599 --> 02:12:55.500
AIRPORT OPERATIONS AND EXPENSES

02:12:55.567 --> 02:12:57.469
HAVE BEEN RISING, THERE'S BEEN

02:12:57.536 --> 02:12:59.137
NO ESCALATION SINCE 1994, AND

02:12:59.204 --> 02:13:01.506
THE FUEL EXCISE TAX LIKE WE HAD

02:13:01.573 --> 02:13:04.076
WITH SB ONE, WITH OUR OUR OUR

02:13:04.142 --> 02:13:06.478
GAS TAX HERE, THAT IS SORT OF

02:13:06.545 --> 02:13:07.846
ADJUSTING FOR INFLATION. AND IS

02:13:07.913 --> 02:13:10.582
THERE ANY WHAT'S THE UTILIZATION

02:13:10.649 --> 02:13:13.752
OF PASSENGER FEES, AIRPORT FEES

02:13:13.819 --> 02:13:16.388
ON, ON PER LANDING BASIS OR PER

02:13:16.455 --> 02:13:18.223
AIRCRAFT BASIS? I MEAN, ALL I'M

02:13:18.290 --> 02:13:19.991
AWARE OF IS MY HOME AIRPORT IN

02:13:20.058 --> 02:13:21.727
SAN DIEGO, AND I'M AWARE OF THE

02:13:21.793 --> 02:13:23.228
$5.60 THAT WE PAY FOR EVERY

02:13:23.295 --> 02:13:24.663
PASSENGER. AND I KNOW WHAT THAT

02:13:24.730 --> 02:13:26.865
GOES TO IN THE FORM OF A MAJOR

02:13:26.932 --> 02:13:28.600
AIRPORT EXPANSION THAT WE ARE

02:13:28.667 --> 02:13:30.035
ENJOYING RIGHT NOW. AND SO I'M

02:13:30.102 --> 02:13:33.038
JUST, YOU KNOW, ARE WE I NEED TO

02:13:33.105 --> 02:13:34.773
I NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER OR

02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:36.541
NOT GOING AFTER SALES AND USE

02:13:36.608 --> 02:13:39.878
TAX ONE IS REALLY REQUIRED OF US

02:13:39.945 --> 02:13:41.480
TO DO SO, TO BE IN COMPLIANCE

02:13:41.546 --> 02:13:42.948
WITH THE FAA'S INTERPRETATION.

02:13:43.014 --> 02:13:44.850
AND IF WE AGREE WITH THE FAA'S

02:13:44.916 --> 02:13:45.484
INTERPRETATION, BECAUSE THAT'S

02:13:45.550 --> 02:13:48.120
GOING TO COME AT THE COST OF

02:13:48.186 --> 02:13:48.787
SOMETHING ELSE, AND IT'S NOT AN

02:13:48.854 --> 02:13:49.988
INSIGNIFICANT COST. AND SO I'M

02:13:50.055 --> 02:13:52.391
JUST I'M TRYING TO LOOK AT ALL

02:13:52.457 --> 02:13:53.725
OF THESE DIFFERENT SOURCES OF

02:13:53.792 --> 02:13:54.393
REVENUES AND MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:13:54.459 --> 02:13:58.230
ARE WE ARE ALL BEING FAITHFUL, I

02:13:58.296 --> 02:14:00.031
GUESS, IN IN HOW WE ARE

02:14:00.098 --> 02:14:00.899
RECEIVING THE FUNDS AND APPLYING

02:14:00.966 --> 02:14:02.901
THOSE FUNDS. THAT I THINK IS THE

02:14:02.968 --> 02:14:04.436
CENTRAL QUESTION THAT WE'RE

02:14:04.503 --> 02:14:05.737
TRYING TO ACHIEVE HERE TODAY. SO

02:14:05.804 --> 02:14:07.873
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY

02:14:07.939 --> 02:14:08.740
MAYBE CLOSING THOUGHTS ON ON

02:14:08.807 --> 02:14:11.476
THIS, ON THIS, ON THIS FUZZY

02:14:11.543 --> 02:14:12.344
MATH. YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME. SO

02:14:12.411 --> 02:14:16.114
I'M GOING TO TAKE IT. I THINK

02:14:16.181 --> 02:14:18.083
THE IMPORTANT THING TO KEEP IN

02:14:18.150 --> 02:14:21.119
MIND HERE IS ONE, IT USED TO BE

02:14:21.186 --> 02:14:23.388
ALL OF THE TAX THAT WAS SUPPOSED

02:14:23.455 --> 02:14:24.823
TO GO BACK TO THE AIRPORTS. IT

02:14:24.890 --> 02:14:27.526
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE 100% OF THE

02:14:27.592 --> 02:14:28.126
SALES AND USE TAX. THAT WOULD

02:14:28.193 --> 02:14:30.562
HAVE COME BACK. THE FEDS BACK IN

02:14:30.629 --> 02:14:32.898
THE 80S SAID, YOU KNOW, WE'RE

02:14:32.964 --> 02:14:35.434
NOT IN COMPLIANCE. LET'S TAKE

02:14:35.500 --> 02:14:36.701
FOR ANYTHING THAT HASN'T BEEN

02:14:36.768 --> 02:14:39.871
IMPOSED AFTER A DATE CERTAIN. SO

02:14:39.938 --> 02:14:43.508
THAT MONEY FOR CLOSE TO 40 YEARS

02:14:43.575 --> 02:14:45.377
HAS BEEN GOING TO OTHER

02:14:45.444 --> 02:14:46.878
PURPOSES. AND YOU KNOW, WHEN IT

02:14:46.945 --> 02:14:48.880
IS GOING TO OTHER PURPOSES THAT

02:14:48.947 --> 02:14:51.483
WE LIKE, WE TEND TO NOT WANT TO

02:14:51.550 --> 02:14:53.151
REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING. BUT THE

02:14:53.218 --> 02:14:56.121
REALITY IS THAT THERE HAS BEEN

02:14:56.188 --> 02:14:59.624
HARM BY NOT BEING IN COMPLIANCE

02:14:59.691 --> 02:15:01.526
FROM GENERAL AVIATION AIRPORTS

02:15:01.593 --> 02:15:04.596
ALL THE WAY UP TO LAX. YOU KNOW,

02:15:04.663 --> 02:15:10.602
THERE ARE IMMENSE NEEDS FOR JUST

02:15:10.669 --> 02:15:12.671
MAKING SURE THAT THE AIRPORT CAN

02:15:12.737 --> 02:15:14.039
OPERATE APPROPRIATELY. JIM CAN

02:15:14.105 --> 02:15:15.874
SPEAK TO THAT MUCH BETTER THAN I

02:15:15.941 --> 02:15:18.443
CAN. BUT FROM THE AIRLINE'S

02:15:18.510 --> 02:15:20.345
PERSPECTIVE, YOU KNOW, THE MORE

02:15:20.412 --> 02:15:22.314
THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THE

02:15:22.380 --> 02:15:24.149
FUNDS DEDICATED FOR A SPECIFIC

02:15:24.216 --> 02:15:26.384
PURPOSE FOR WHICH THESE ARE ARE

02:15:26.451 --> 02:15:27.519
GOING TO THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH

02:15:27.586 --> 02:15:29.321
THEY WERE INTENDED AND NOT FOR

02:15:29.387 --> 02:15:31.723
WHAT THE STATE FEELS LIKE. THEY

02:15:31.790 --> 02:15:34.659
WOULD PREFER IT TO GO TO AND

02:15:34.726 --> 02:15:36.161
WITH, YOU KNOW, THE GREATEST

02:15:36.228 --> 02:15:38.563
RESPECT FOR, FOR, YOU KNOW, OUR

02:15:38.630 --> 02:15:40.398
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OVER THE

02:15:40.465 --> 02:15:41.800
YEARS, IT'S NOT JUST THIS

02:15:41.867 --> 02:15:43.401
SNAPSHOT IN TIME, BUT IT'S OVER

02:15:43.468 --> 02:15:47.038
THE YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN A BIT

02:15:47.105 --> 02:15:49.841
OF A APPROACH AVOIDANCE, FOR

02:15:49.908 --> 02:15:52.777
LACK OF A BETTER TERM, IN TERMS

02:15:52.844 --> 02:15:53.411
OF DEALING WITH THE SITUATION.

02:15:53.478 --> 02:15:55.146
WE STAND TO LOSE BILLIONS AND

02:15:55.213 --> 02:15:56.882
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FEDERAL

02:15:56.948 --> 02:15:58.083
TRANSPORTATION FUNDS IF WE DON'T

02:15:58.149 --> 02:16:00.485
COME INTO COMPLIANCE. THAT FIRST

02:16:00.552 --> 02:16:03.021
AND FOREMOST SHOULD BE VERY

02:16:03.088 --> 02:16:05.624
CONCERNING TO THIS COMMITTEE. WE

02:16:05.690 --> 02:16:07.025
ARE VERY CONCERNED. WE WANT ALL

02:16:07.092 --> 02:16:10.161
OF OUR PARTNERS WHO OPERATE IN

02:16:10.228 --> 02:16:11.796
TRANSPORTATION TO HAVE THEIR

02:16:11.863 --> 02:16:14.266
FUNDS, THEIR NEEDS MET WITH

02:16:14.332 --> 02:16:16.401
THIS. THERE ARE AIRPORT NEEDS

02:16:16.468 --> 02:16:18.637
THAT THAT HAVE EITHER GONE

02:16:18.703 --> 02:16:21.139
UNFUNDED OR HAVE BEEN SEVERELY

02:16:21.206 --> 02:16:22.874
DELAYED. SO, YOU KNOW, THIS

02:16:22.941 --> 02:16:24.409
ISN'T MONEY THAT WILL GO BACK

02:16:24.476 --> 02:16:26.845
INTO OUR POCKET, BUT WE DO WANT

02:16:26.912 --> 02:16:28.813
TO MAKE SURE IT'S GOING TO THE

02:16:28.880 --> 02:16:30.448
RIGHT PLACES FOR THE RIGHT

02:16:30.515 --> 02:16:33.251
REASONS, AND THAT IT'S FAIR AND

02:16:33.318 --> 02:16:35.120
EQUITABLE. AND WILL IT IMPACT

02:16:35.186 --> 02:16:37.222
LOCALS? GENERALLY, THE LOCAL

02:16:37.289 --> 02:16:39.824
SALES TAX ON ON JET FUEL IS

02:16:39.891 --> 02:16:41.393
ANYWHERE BETWEEN A HALF A CENT,

02:16:41.459 --> 02:16:44.596
ONE AND A HALF CENT SOMEWHERE

02:16:44.663 --> 02:16:47.299
AROUND THERE. AND ALL I CAN DO

02:16:47.365 --> 02:16:50.502
IS, IS JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT.

02:16:50.569 --> 02:16:52.270
BUT IT WASN'T REALLY IN

02:16:52.337 --> 02:16:55.640
COMPLIANCE TO BEGIN WITH. AND

02:16:55.707 --> 02:16:57.142
FRANKLY, MEETING A COUNTY'S

02:16:57.208 --> 02:16:59.544
NEEDS THROUGH THEIR AIRPORT AND

02:16:59.611 --> 02:17:01.012
TAKING MORE OF THE PRESSURE OFF

02:17:01.079 --> 02:17:03.181
FROM THE DEMANDS OF NOT BEING IN

02:17:03.248 --> 02:17:04.716
COMPLIANCE OR NOT BEING ABLE TO

02:17:04.783 --> 02:17:06.117
DO YOUR REPAIRS OR MAINTENANCE,

02:17:06.184 --> 02:17:10.722
ETC, IS ALSO A COST. SO IT'S

02:17:10.789 --> 02:17:12.157
WHILE I WOULD SAY, YOU KNOW, I

02:17:12.223 --> 02:17:13.959
CAN HEAR YOUR CONCERN ABOUT

02:17:14.025 --> 02:17:16.094
PULLING MONEY OUT FROM OTHER

02:17:16.161 --> 02:17:21.232
PROGRAMS. FRANKLY, A LOT OF THAT

02:17:21.299 --> 02:17:22.167
MONEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN GOING TO

02:17:22.233 --> 02:17:24.235
THE TO THE AIRPORTS TO START

02:17:24.302 --> 02:17:25.503
WITH. RIGHT. AND THANK YOU,

02:17:25.570 --> 02:17:26.671
MADAM CHAIR. I'LL JUST CLOSE.

02:17:26.738 --> 02:17:29.874
SAY AGAIN, I, I SEE VERY

02:17:29.941 --> 02:17:31.977
DIRECTLY FUEL EXCISE TAXES AND

02:17:32.043 --> 02:17:32.777
OTHER OTHER TAXES THAT ARE

02:17:32.844 --> 02:17:34.512
APPLIED DIRECTLY FOR AVIATION

02:17:34.579 --> 02:17:37.415
FUEL AS BEING SOMETHING THAT IS

02:17:37.482 --> 02:17:39.117
DIRECTLY LINKED TO AND SHOULD

02:17:39.184 --> 02:17:40.251
SUPPORT THE ACTIVITY THAT'S

02:17:40.318 --> 02:17:42.787
THERE. A GENERAL TAX IN THIS

02:17:42.854 --> 02:17:45.657
CASE SALES AND USE TAX, I NEED

02:17:45.724 --> 02:17:47.459
MORE. I'M GOING TO NEED MORE

02:17:47.525 --> 02:17:48.627
RESEARCH TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER

02:17:48.693 --> 02:17:50.295
OR NOT WE AGREE THAT THIS IS IN

02:17:50.362 --> 02:17:51.396
COMPLIANCE WITH THE FAA ORDERS.

02:17:51.463 --> 02:17:53.865
THEY'RE SAYING THAT IT IS. BUT

02:17:53.932 --> 02:17:56.101
HOW OFTEN DOES A FEDERAL AGENCY

02:17:56.167 --> 02:17:58.770
DIRECT THAT A STATE TAX NEEDS TO

02:17:58.837 --> 02:18:01.539
GO INTO A CERTAIN FUNCTION.

02:18:01.606 --> 02:18:03.375
RIGHT. AND SO WE MAKE THOSE

02:18:03.441 --> 02:18:04.142
DECISIONS, RIGHT. IF WE WANT TO

02:18:04.209 --> 02:18:05.944
SUSPEND THE SALES AND USE TAX ON

02:18:06.011 --> 02:18:07.879
DIAPERS, OR WE WANT TO SUSPEND

02:18:07.946 --> 02:18:09.981
THE SALES AND USE TAX ON HEAVY

02:18:10.048 --> 02:18:10.582
MANUFACTURING, AS WE DISCUSSED

02:18:10.649 --> 02:18:12.217
EARLIER ON A DIFFERENT ITEM

02:18:12.283 --> 02:18:13.818
RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE THERE WAS AN

02:18:13.885 --> 02:18:14.452
ECONOMIC BENEFIT THERE. AND SO

02:18:14.519 --> 02:18:16.254
THAT THAT IS, I THINK, THE AREA

02:18:16.321 --> 02:18:18.556
OF STUDY I NEED TO DIG INTO A

02:18:18.623 --> 02:18:19.791
LITTLE BIT MORE TO SEE. AND

02:18:19.858 --> 02:18:20.992
MAYBE THAT'S THAT'S WHAT'S

02:18:21.059 --> 02:18:22.394
PREDATED THIS CONVERSATION. HERE

02:18:22.460 --> 02:18:23.194
TOO, IS DISAGREEMENT WHETHER OR

02:18:23.261 --> 02:18:25.263
NOT THEY ARE INCORRECTLY

02:18:25.330 --> 02:18:26.297
INTERPRETING WHAT APPLIES TO

02:18:26.364 --> 02:18:28.800
THAT. IF THEY'RE CORRECT, THEN

02:18:28.867 --> 02:18:30.802
THEN WE SHOULD GO AHEAD AND MAKE

02:18:30.869 --> 02:18:32.804
SURE EVERYTHING IS MADE WHOLE

02:18:32.871 --> 02:18:34.939
HERE AND EVERYTHING IS SORT OF

02:18:35.006 --> 02:18:36.074
CLOSED UP HERE. ULTIMATELY, WE

02:18:36.141 --> 02:18:38.443
DO WANT TO SUPPORT OUR AIRPORTS

02:18:38.510 --> 02:18:39.377
TOO, BUT IF THAT IS GOING TO

02:18:39.444 --> 02:18:41.413
COME AT SOME SIGNIFICANT COST TO

02:18:41.479 --> 02:18:42.547
SOMETHING ELSE, THAT'S SOMETHING

02:18:42.614 --> 02:18:44.082
THAT WE HAVE TO WEIGH ON

02:18:44.149 --> 02:18:45.684
BALANCE. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT.

02:18:45.750 --> 02:18:48.753
WE HAVE TWO OTHER MICS UP, SO TO

02:18:48.820 --> 02:18:52.757
SPEAK. AND THEN RANSOM, I JUST

02:18:52.824 --> 02:18:54.426
HAVE A QUICK QUESTION ABOUT

02:18:54.492 --> 02:18:56.461
PROPORTIONALITY. IS WHAT'S

02:18:56.528 --> 02:18:58.096
REFLECTED IN THE BILL

02:18:58.163 --> 02:18:58.997
PROPORTIONAL TO WHO BRINGS IN

02:18:59.064 --> 02:19:01.466
WHAT. FOR EXAMPLE, LARGE HUB

02:19:01.533 --> 02:19:03.768
AIRPORTS REFLECT 30% OF THE

02:19:03.835 --> 02:19:06.304
TAXES COLLECTED. OR WHERE ARE WE

02:19:06.371 --> 02:19:08.339
ON THE. BECAUSE THE STAFF REPORT

02:19:08.406 --> 02:19:10.041
DOES SUGGEST YOU MAY WANT TO

02:19:10.108 --> 02:19:11.643
CONSIDER THAT. AND THEY'RE NOT

02:19:11.710 --> 02:19:12.677
GOING TO ASK THE QUESTION, BUT

02:19:12.744 --> 02:19:14.579
I'M GOING TO ASK THE QUESTION

02:19:14.646 --> 02:19:17.415
WHERE ARE WE WITH IT? SO WE ARE

02:19:17.482 --> 02:19:18.917
MOVING, I THINK, TOWARDS A

02:19:18.983 --> 02:19:21.352
LITTLE BIT MORE EQUITABLE

02:19:21.419 --> 02:19:23.154
ALLOCATION. I THINK IF WE WENT

02:19:23.221 --> 02:19:25.690
BACK TO A RETURN TO SOURCE,

02:19:25.757 --> 02:19:27.792
NEARLY HALF OF THE MONEY WOULD

02:19:27.859 --> 02:19:30.328
GO BACK TO LAX AND SFO. AND SO

02:19:30.395 --> 02:19:33.364
WE'RE TRYING TO GIVE AND THERE'S

02:19:33.431 --> 02:19:34.265
A PROBLEM THERE. I'M TEASING I'M

02:19:34.332 --> 02:19:36.534
TEASING. HAVING SFO IN MY

02:19:36.601 --> 02:19:38.636
DISTRICT. I JUST COULDN'T PLEASE

02:19:38.703 --> 02:19:40.872
UNDERSTAND. SO WE'RE TRYING TO

02:19:40.939 --> 02:19:42.240
MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET A

02:19:42.307 --> 02:19:44.075
HEALTHY SHARE OF THAT MONEY

02:19:44.142 --> 02:19:46.845
BACK. BUT ALSO IT GIVES US THE

02:19:46.911 --> 02:19:47.479
OPPORTUNITY, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE

02:19:47.545 --> 02:19:49.781
IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE ONGOING

02:19:49.848 --> 02:19:52.283
FUNDS TO DO SOME WORK AT SMALLER

02:19:52.350 --> 02:19:54.819
AIRPORTS. AND I WOULD JUST ADD

02:19:54.886 --> 02:19:55.553
TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER WARD'S

02:19:55.620 --> 02:19:57.455
QUESTION, THE FAA SPENT 30 YEARS

02:19:57.522 --> 02:19:59.457
WITH THIS RULE ON THE BOOKS

02:19:59.524 --> 02:20:01.659
WITHOUT ENFORCING IT, AND THEY

02:20:01.726 --> 02:20:03.495
ONLY ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WANTED

02:20:03.561 --> 02:20:06.064
PEOPLE TO GET INTO COMPLIANCE IN

02:20:06.131 --> 02:20:08.199
2014, AND MOST STATES WERE NOT

02:20:08.266 --> 02:20:10.368
IN COMPLIANCE WHEN THAT WAS

02:20:10.435 --> 02:20:12.070
ANNOUNCED. WE ARE ONE OF ABOUT 6

02:20:12.137 --> 02:20:14.539
OR 7 STATES THAT REMAIN OUT OF

02:20:14.606 --> 02:20:18.943
COMPLIANCE TO THIS DAY. THANK

02:20:19.010 --> 02:20:21.880
YOU RANSOM. THANK YOU, MADAM

02:20:21.946 --> 02:20:23.948
CHAIR. THANK YOU, SENATOR, AND

02:20:24.015 --> 02:20:26.518
THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTERS. I

02:20:26.584 --> 02:20:27.986
HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. SOME

02:20:28.052 --> 02:20:30.155
HAVE JUST COME TO ME DURING

02:20:30.221 --> 02:20:31.990
LISTENING TO THIS CONVERSATION.

02:20:32.056 --> 02:20:34.092
SO THE GENERAL AVIATION AIRPORT

02:20:34.159 --> 02:20:35.593
IS AN AIRPORT THAT'S FOR PUBLIC

02:20:35.660 --> 02:20:37.262
USE. IS THAT CORRECT? LIKE THE

02:20:37.328 --> 02:20:38.830
LARGER AIRPORTS WE'RE NOT

02:20:38.897 --> 02:20:42.100
TALKING ABOUT LIKE THE SMALL

02:20:42.167 --> 02:20:44.102
AIRPORTS. SO IN MY COMMUNITY, WE

02:20:44.169 --> 02:20:45.670
DON'T HAVE AN AIRPORT WHERE YOU

02:20:45.737 --> 02:20:47.172
CAN TAKE A COMMERCIAL FLIGHT,

02:20:47.238 --> 02:20:48.973
BUT WE DO HAVE PLANES FLY IN TO

02:20:49.040 --> 02:20:51.709
FILL UP BECAUSE IT'S TRACY.

02:20:51.776 --> 02:20:54.245
TRACY AIRPORT HAS CHEAP GAS, SO

02:20:54.312 --> 02:20:55.880
THEY COME IN, THEY FILL UP

02:20:55.947 --> 02:20:58.149
THERE. BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING

02:20:58.216 --> 02:20:58.983
THEY WOULD NOT THAT PARTICULAR

02:20:59.050 --> 02:21:00.218
AIRPORT WOULD NOT QUALIFY FOR

02:21:00.285 --> 02:21:02.554
THE 50% OF THE DOLLARS GOING

02:21:02.620 --> 02:21:03.922
BACK TO YOUR AIRPORT BECAUSE

02:21:03.988 --> 02:21:05.523
IT'S A SMALLER AIRPORT OR. OR

02:21:05.590 --> 02:21:07.225
WOULD THEY BE CONSIDERED A

02:21:07.292 --> 02:21:08.126
GENERAL AVIATION AIRPORT UNDER

02:21:08.193 --> 02:21:10.495
THIS BILL? THEY ARE GENERAL

02:21:10.562 --> 02:21:11.729
AVIATION, BUT THEY WOULD GET

02:21:11.796 --> 02:21:13.598
SOME MONEY BACK IF THEY'RE

02:21:13.665 --> 02:21:14.866
SELLING FUEL. OKAY, SO BUT THEY

02:21:14.933 --> 02:21:16.301
WOULD NOT GET THE 50%, THEY

02:21:16.367 --> 02:21:18.570
WOULD GET SOME MONEY BACK. WELL,

02:21:18.636 --> 02:21:20.538
THE IDEA IS WHERE WE STARTED IS

02:21:20.605 --> 02:21:23.208
THAT HALF OF THE MONEY, 50%

02:21:23.274 --> 02:21:24.409
WOULD GO BACK TO THE AIRPORT

02:21:24.475 --> 02:21:27.011
THAT GENERATED IT, WHICH HELPS

02:21:27.078 --> 02:21:28.847
LAX AND SFO FEEL A BIT BETTER

02:21:28.913 --> 02:21:31.282
ABOUT THIS. THE OTHER HALF IS

02:21:31.349 --> 02:21:32.817
WHERE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:21:32.884 --> 02:21:35.253
BE A BIT CREATIVE AND SUPPORT

02:21:35.320 --> 02:21:37.188
GENERAL AVIATION, AIRPORTS AND

02:21:37.255 --> 02:21:39.023
SOME OF THE SMALLER AIRPORTS

02:21:39.090 --> 02:21:41.125
LIKE MEADOW FIELD, MEADOWS FIELD

02:21:41.192 --> 02:21:42.894
IN SENATOR HURTADO'S DISTRICT.

02:21:42.961 --> 02:21:44.596
OKAY, SO WHEN READING THE

02:21:44.662 --> 02:21:46.164
ANALYSIS IN THE BILL, IT SAID

02:21:46.231 --> 02:21:47.866
THAT 50% WOULD GO BACK TO

02:21:47.932 --> 02:21:50.335
GENERAL AVIATION THAT HAD THAT

02:21:50.401 --> 02:21:51.903
SELLS FUEL. SO THE SMALLER

02:21:51.970 --> 02:21:54.005
AIRPORTS, IF THEY SELL FUEL,

02:21:54.072 --> 02:21:57.242
WOULD QUALIFY FOR THE 50%. AND

02:21:57.308 --> 02:21:58.743
NOW WHEN WE LOOK AT THE

02:21:58.810 --> 02:21:59.944
PROPORTION PIECE, FIRST OF ALL,

02:22:00.011 --> 02:22:02.013
HOW DID YOU ALL COME? WHO CAME

02:22:02.080 --> 02:22:03.081
UP WITH THE FORMULA. THAT'S

02:22:03.147 --> 02:22:04.582
THAT'S THE QUESTION. I DON'T

02:22:04.649 --> 02:22:06.050
KNOW IF ANYBODY WANTS TO TAKE

02:22:06.117 --> 02:22:09.454
CREDIT. THIS WAS LIFTED LARGELY

02:22:09.520 --> 02:22:11.990
FROM A BILL THAT WAS DONE, I

02:22:12.056 --> 02:22:17.061
BELIEVE, IN 2015 BY SENATOR

02:22:17.128 --> 02:22:19.130
MCGUIRE. SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING

02:22:19.197 --> 02:22:21.432
ON THIS FOR A LONG TIME. AND

02:22:21.499 --> 02:22:23.701
THAT'S WHERE THE ORIGINAL

02:22:23.768 --> 02:22:25.336
FRAMEWORK FOR THE FORMULA CAME

02:22:25.403 --> 02:22:27.238
FROM. AND THEN WE'VE BEEN DO WE

02:22:27.305 --> 02:22:28.940
KNOW THE ORIGINAL? DO WE KNOW

02:22:29.007 --> 02:22:29.874
THE RATIONALE FOR THE FORMULA?

02:22:29.941 --> 02:22:31.843
BECAUSE THE FORMULA WAS KIND OF

02:22:31.910 --> 02:22:34.212
INTERESTING TO ME. SO DO WE KNOW

02:22:34.279 --> 02:22:36.915
THE RATIONALE FOR THE FORMULA?

02:22:36.981 --> 02:22:39.284
WELL, I THINK PART OF THE REASON

02:22:39.350 --> 02:22:40.518
SENATOR MAGUIRE'S DISTRICT IS

02:22:40.585 --> 02:22:42.987
ALSO SOMEWHAT RURAL. AND SO HE

02:22:43.054 --> 02:22:45.056
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT SOME OF

02:22:45.123 --> 02:22:46.758
THE SMALLER AIRPORTS IN HIS

02:22:46.824 --> 02:22:48.760
DISTRICT BENEFITED FROM US

02:22:48.826 --> 02:22:51.296
GETTING INTO COMPLIANCE ON THESE

02:22:51.362 --> 02:22:53.498
REVENUES AND NOT HAVING MOST OF

02:22:53.564 --> 02:22:55.900
IT GO BACK TO SIMPLY THE LARGER

02:22:55.967 --> 02:22:57.035
COMMERCIAL AIRPORTS. OKAY. NOW

02:22:57.101 --> 02:22:58.803
THE LARGER AIRPORTS WILL ONLY

02:22:58.870 --> 02:23:00.838
QUALIFY FOR THE 50%, OR IS IT

02:23:00.905 --> 02:23:04.342
50% AND A PROPORTION BASED ON.

02:23:04.409 --> 02:23:07.078
SO IT'S IT IS THE LATTER. IT'S

02:23:07.145 --> 02:23:09.514
50% PLUS WHAT THEY WILL GET OUT

02:23:09.580 --> 02:23:11.883
OF THE OTHER 50% ALLOCATION. LAX

02:23:11.950 --> 02:23:13.251
WILL BE AMAZING. AND THEN OTHER

02:23:13.318 --> 02:23:14.619
FOLKS WILL HAVE TO STILL

02:23:14.686 --> 02:23:16.387
STRUGGLE A LITTLE BIT. AND HOW

02:23:16.454 --> 02:23:19.724
DOES THAT WORK WITH THE GRANTS.

02:23:19.791 --> 02:23:22.527
SO IT WE PREVIOUSLY HAD A

02:23:22.593 --> 02:23:25.363
RELIANCE A HUGE RELIANCE ON

02:23:25.430 --> 02:23:26.931
GRANTS. SOMETIMES YOU GET THEM,

02:23:26.998 --> 02:23:29.133
SOMETIMES YOU DON'T. SO THE 50%

02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:30.935
CAN ONLY BE USED FOR LIKE

02:23:31.002 --> 02:23:32.203
INFRASTRUCTURE AND UPGRADES AND

02:23:32.270 --> 02:23:34.105
THINGS LIKE THAT. BUT I DID NOT

02:23:34.172 --> 02:23:36.975
SEE THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL IN THE

02:23:37.041 --> 02:23:40.545
OTHER PROPORTIONS. SO TWO

02:23:40.611 --> 02:23:45.483
QUESTIONS IN ONE. SO Ã DOES THE

02:23:45.550 --> 02:23:47.785
OPPOSITE. THE ONES WHO GET IT AS

02:23:47.852 --> 02:23:48.753
PROPORTIONATE. DO THEY HAVE THE

02:23:48.820 --> 02:23:51.155
REQUIREMENT? IT SAYS IT CAN BE

02:23:51.222 --> 02:23:52.290
USED FOR EDUCATION, BUT IS IT

02:23:52.357 --> 02:23:53.958
REQUIRED TO ALSO BE USED FOR

02:23:54.025 --> 02:23:55.326
INFRASTRUCTURE EXPANSION AND

02:23:55.393 --> 02:23:57.228
THINGS LIKE THAT? I THINK

02:23:57.295 --> 02:23:58.563
THERE'S A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY

02:23:58.629 --> 02:24:00.131
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD INTO

02:24:00.198 --> 02:24:02.200
THE LANGUAGE TO GIVE AN AIRPORT

02:24:02.266 --> 02:24:04.769
AND THE STATE SOME LATITUDE ON

02:24:04.836 --> 02:24:06.337
HOW THE MONEY IS SPENT. THE FAA

02:24:06.404 --> 02:24:08.339
SIMPLY SAYS IT MUST BE SPENT ON

02:24:08.406 --> 02:24:11.275
AN AVIATION PURPOSE. AFTER THAT,

02:24:11.342 --> 02:24:15.013
THE TAXING JURISDICTION GETS TO

02:24:15.079 --> 02:24:17.415
DECIDE HOW THEY WANT THAT TO BE

02:24:17.482 --> 02:24:19.150
SPENT. OKAY. AND IS THIS GOING

02:24:19.217 --> 02:24:20.952
TO REPLACE RELIANCE ON GRANTS OR

02:24:21.019 --> 02:24:22.553
IS THIS GOING TO BE ADDITIVE.

02:24:22.620 --> 02:24:24.622
THIS IS GOING TO BE ADDITIVE TO

02:24:24.689 --> 02:24:25.923
THE GRANTS. SO IT SHOULD PUT US

02:24:25.990 --> 02:24:28.393
IN A BETTER POSITION. OKAY. SO

02:24:28.459 --> 02:24:30.261
I'M JUST GOING TO SAY FOR THE

02:24:30.328 --> 02:24:31.562
RECORD I WILL I'M STILL THINKING

02:24:31.629 --> 02:24:32.897
ABOUT THIS. I WILL PROBABLY

02:24:32.964 --> 02:24:35.133
SUPPORT IT. BUT I'M REALLY STILL

02:24:35.199 --> 02:24:36.467
FEELS LIKE THIS NEEDS A LOT OF

02:24:36.534 --> 02:24:39.237
WORK IN REGARDS TO UNDERSTANDING

02:24:39.303 --> 02:24:43.241
THE HOW YOU PLAN TO DO THE

02:24:43.307 --> 02:24:45.176
PROPORTIONS FOR FOLKS THAT ARE

02:24:45.243 --> 02:24:47.145
NOT IN THAT THAT LARGE 50%

02:24:47.211 --> 02:24:49.447
CATEGORY. SO BUT I DO APPRECIATE

02:24:49.514 --> 02:24:50.148
THE EFFORTS BECAUSE I KNOW

02:24:50.214 --> 02:24:52.016
THERE'S A LOT OF SMALL

02:24:52.083 --> 02:24:52.583
STRUGGLING AIRPORTS. THERE'S

02:24:52.650 --> 02:24:54.719
ACTUALLY TWO IN MY LITTLE TOWN.

02:24:54.786 --> 02:24:59.057
SO I DO APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS.

02:24:59.123 --> 02:25:01.959
ALL RIGHT. SEEING NO OTHER

02:25:02.026 --> 02:25:02.994
COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE, WE

02:25:03.061 --> 02:25:06.230
DO HAVE A MOTION FROM MISATO AND

02:25:06.297 --> 02:25:07.765
A SECOND BY ARENS. I'LL NOTE

02:25:07.832 --> 02:25:11.302
THAT I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK TO

02:25:11.369 --> 02:25:12.804
RETURN STATE AVIATION FUEL TAX

02:25:12.870 --> 02:25:14.572
REVENUES FROM THE GENERAL FUND

02:25:14.639 --> 02:25:16.274
TO THE AERONAUTICS ACCOUNT, AND

02:25:16.340 --> 02:25:18.609
TO BE USED FOR AVIATION

02:25:18.676 --> 02:25:20.344
PURPOSES, AS WAS NOTED AS A PART

02:25:20.411 --> 02:25:22.180
OF THE TESTIMONY THAT THESE

02:33:11.115 --> 02:33:12.283
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT TEARS AT

02:33:12.349 --> 02:33:13.784
THE FABRIC OF OUR COMMUNITIES,

02:33:13.851 --> 02:33:15.786
TRIGGERING MANY ADVERSE EFFECTS.

02:33:15.853 --> 02:33:16.754
ADDITIONALLY, I DESCRIBED THE

02:33:16.820 --> 02:33:17.821
THREAT OF IMMIGRATION

02:33:17.888 --> 02:33:19.690
ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY AND THE

02:33:19.757 --> 02:33:21.525
SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CURRENT

02:33:21.592 --> 02:33:22.560
ADMINISTRATION'S CHANGES IN

02:33:22.626 --> 02:33:24.762
POLICY REGARDING SENSITIVE

02:33:24.828 --> 02:33:26.163
LOCATIONS. UNFORTUNATELY, I

02:33:26.230 --> 02:33:27.665
DON'T BELIEVE IT IS NECESSARY

02:33:27.731 --> 02:33:29.166
FOR ME TO HAVE TO PAINT THAT

02:33:29.233 --> 02:33:31.068
PICTURE FOR YOU TODAY. MANY OF

02:33:31.135 --> 02:33:32.303
YOU CAN SEE IT FIRSTHAND IN YOUR

02:33:32.369 --> 02:33:34.371
OWN COMMUNITIES RIGHT NOW AND

02:33:34.438 --> 02:33:35.539
UNDERSTAND THE NEGATIVE MENTAL,

02:33:35.606 --> 02:33:37.441
PHYSICAL, AND FINANCIAL STRAINS

02:33:37.508 --> 02:33:38.709
THESE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS ARE

02:33:38.776 --> 02:33:40.744
HAVING ON INDIVIDUALS AS WELL AS

02:33:40.811 --> 02:33:42.379
THEIR FAMILIES AND ENTIRE

02:33:42.446 --> 02:33:44.949
NEIGHBORHOODS. SB 274 IS NEEDED

02:33:45.015 --> 02:33:46.817
TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THIS DATA

02:33:46.884 --> 02:33:48.819
CAN ONLY BE USED FOR SPECIFIED

02:33:48.886 --> 02:33:51.188
NARROW PURPOSES, RATHER THAN

02:33:51.255 --> 02:33:52.523
SHARING INFORMATION WITH FEDERAL

02:33:52.590 --> 02:33:54.258
AGENTS FOR NON-CRIME, FIGHTING

02:33:54.325 --> 02:33:56.260
MOTIVES, AS CALMATTERS REPORTED,

02:33:56.327 --> 02:33:58.562
WAS DONE MORE THAN 100 TIMES IN

02:33:58.629 --> 02:34:00.364
MAY BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES

02:34:00.431 --> 02:34:03.233
ACROSS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SB

02:34:03.300 --> 02:34:05.302
274 ALSO TAKES A POSITIVE STEP

02:34:05.369 --> 02:34:06.737
TOWARDS LIMITING SURVEILLANCE OF

02:34:06.804 --> 02:34:09.006
THE GENERAL PUBLIC BY LIMITING

02:34:09.073 --> 02:34:10.841
RETENTION WITH SPECIFIED

02:34:10.908 --> 02:34:12.242
EXEMPTIONS. THIS BILL CREATES AN

02:34:12.309 --> 02:34:13.277
IMPORTANT INITIAL GUARDRAIL

02:34:13.344 --> 02:34:15.479
AGAINST UNFETTERED LICENSE PLATE

02:34:15.546 --> 02:34:16.647
SURVEILLANCE, WHICH INFRINGES ON

02:34:16.714 --> 02:34:18.849
ALL CALIFORNIANS PRIVACY. I ASK

02:34:18.916 --> 02:34:21.318
FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU,

02:34:21.385 --> 02:34:22.786
THANK YOU. NOW MOVING ON.

02:34:22.853 --> 02:34:23.954
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO WOULD

02:34:24.021 --> 02:34:26.490
LIKE TO ADD ON THEIR SUPPORT FOR

02:34:26.557 --> 02:34:29.560
THIS BILL NAME, AFFILIATION AND

02:34:29.627 --> 02:34:32.796
POSITION, AND STARTING OFF THE

02:34:32.863 --> 02:34:35.366
BETWEENERS BECCA KRAMER WITH

02:34:35.432 --> 02:34:37.234
KAISER ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF

02:34:37.301 --> 02:34:38.902
ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION.

02:34:38.969 --> 02:34:41.805
WE DO NOT HAVE A POSITION ON THE

02:34:41.872 --> 02:34:43.007
BILL AS IT IS IN PRINT, BUT VERY

02:34:43.073 --> 02:34:44.575
MUCH APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S

02:34:44.642 --> 02:34:45.709
OFFICE WORKING WITH US ON THIS

02:34:45.776 --> 02:34:48.178
BILL. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER

TWEENERS OR SUPPORTERS? OKAY,

02:34:51.882 --> 02:34:54.351
WITH THAT, WE WILL MOVE ON TO

02:34:54.418 --> 02:34:56.487
OPPOSITION. I BELIEVE WE HAVE

02:34:56.553 --> 02:35:03.727
SOME TESTIFYING IN OPPOSITION.

02:35:03.794 --> 02:35:04.962
IT'S OUR FIRST. WE WENT THROUGH

02:35:05.029 --> 02:35:12.036
A NUMBER OF BILLS WITHOUT IT. AS

02:35:12.102 --> 02:35:13.103
A REMINDER, YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES

02:35:13.170 --> 02:35:15.873
APIECE. THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR.

02:35:15.939 --> 02:35:17.307
MEMBERS CORY SALZILLO, ON BEHALF

02:35:17.374 --> 02:35:18.842
OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS

02:35:18.909 --> 02:35:20.911
ASSOCIATION HERE IN OPPOSITION

02:35:20.978 --> 02:35:23.981
TO THE BILL, FIRST WOULD LIKE TO

02:35:24.048 --> 02:35:25.416
MAKE CLEAR THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:35:25.482 --> 02:35:27.117
AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE AND

02:35:27.184 --> 02:35:28.585
THE NATION HAVE USED ALPR DATA

02:35:28.652 --> 02:35:29.453
TO SOLVE CRIMES AND APPREHEND

02:35:29.520 --> 02:35:30.788
CRIMINAL SUSPECTS, AND CONTINUE

02:35:30.854 --> 02:35:32.222
TO DO SO TODAY. WHILE SOME CASES

02:35:32.289 --> 02:35:34.491
ARE SOLVED QUICKLY USING THIS

02:35:34.558 --> 02:35:36.026
TECHNOLOGY, THAT SAME DAY, OR

02:35:36.093 --> 02:35:37.995
MAYBE A DAY LATER, IT CAN ALSO

02:35:38.062 --> 02:35:39.463
BE EXCEPTIONALLY HELPFUL IN

02:35:39.530 --> 02:35:40.164
SOLVING CRIMES THAT HAVE

02:35:40.230 --> 02:35:42.332
OCCURRED DEEPER IN THE PAST AND

02:35:42.399 --> 02:35:44.134
SETTING A DATA RETENTION LIMIT,

02:35:44.201 --> 02:35:45.903
SUCH AS 60 DAYS IN STATUTE,

02:35:45.969 --> 02:35:47.705
WHICH IS BASED ON REALLY NOTHING

02:35:47.771 --> 02:35:49.139
AT ALL, WILL SIGNIFICANTLY

02:35:49.206 --> 02:35:51.275
HINDER THE USE OF A VALUABLE LAW

02:35:51.341 --> 02:35:53.410
ENFORCEMENT TOOL. TO BE CLEAR,

02:35:53.477 --> 02:35:54.812
IF THIS BILL PASSES, THERE WILL

02:35:54.878 --> 02:35:56.246
BE CRIMES THAT GO UNSOLVED OR

02:35:56.313 --> 02:35:59.783
HAVE THEIR RESOLUTIONS DELAYED.

02:35:59.850 --> 02:36:01.618
IF WE REQUIRE THE DESTRUCTION OF

02:36:01.685 --> 02:36:03.187
EVIDENCE AS AS WE DO IN THIS

02:36:03.253 --> 02:36:05.622
BILL, AS IT'S CURRENTLY DRAFTED.

02:36:05.689 --> 02:36:07.858
AND OVER THE YEARS, AND

02:36:07.925 --> 02:36:09.293
RESPECTFULLY, WE'VE SEEN EFFORTS

02:36:09.359 --> 02:36:11.295
TO LIMIT ALPR DATA RETENTION

02:36:11.361 --> 02:36:13.664
BEFORE, IT WAS BASED ON THIS

02:36:13.731 --> 02:36:15.065
NOTION GENERALLY THAT LAW

02:36:15.132 --> 02:36:17.334
ENFORCEMENT WOULD USE THE DATA

02:36:17.401 --> 02:36:20.104
TO TRACK INDIVIDUALS AND VIOLATE

02:36:20.170 --> 02:36:21.805
A NONEXISTENT EXPECTATION OF

02:36:21.872 --> 02:36:23.140
PRIVACY WHEN OUT IN THE PUBLIC.

02:36:23.207 --> 02:36:25.175
AND THEN IT WAS ABOUT CONCERNS

02:36:25.242 --> 02:36:26.810
ABOUT OTHER STATES TRYING TO USE

02:36:26.877 --> 02:36:29.213
CALIFORNIA ALPR DATA TO ENFORCE

02:36:29.279 --> 02:36:31.281
THEIR ABORTION LAWS. AND NOW

02:36:31.348 --> 02:36:32.616
WE'RE USING THE CONCERNS OVER

02:36:32.683 --> 02:36:34.318
FEDERAL IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT,

02:36:34.384 --> 02:36:37.654
WHICH I'M NOT COMMENTING ON THE

02:36:37.721 --> 02:36:38.922
VERACITY OF ANY OF THOSE THINGS

02:36:38.989 --> 02:36:40.557
OR WHETHER THEY'RE RIGHT OR

02:36:40.624 --> 02:36:42.392
WRONG. BUT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT,

02:36:42.459 --> 02:36:43.794
OUR INTENTION HAS REMAINED

02:36:43.861 --> 02:36:45.162
UNCHANGED, AND THAT'S TO ENSURE

02:36:45.229 --> 02:36:46.430
THAT WE AREN'T ARBITRARILY TYING

02:36:46.497 --> 02:36:48.799
LAW ENFORCEMENT'S HANDS IN OUR

02:36:48.866 --> 02:36:50.267
CRIME FIGHTING EFFORTS. THE

02:36:50.334 --> 02:36:51.602
BOTTOM LINE IS, WE DON'T ALWAYS

02:36:51.668 --> 02:36:53.871
KNOW WHEN THE ALPR DATA WILL BE

02:36:53.937 --> 02:36:56.440
USEFUL. WE MAY BE ABLE TO SAY,

02:36:56.507 --> 02:36:58.876
HEY, WE'RE LOOKING FOR A BLACK

02:36:58.942 --> 02:37:00.911
FORD WITH LICENSE PLATE ABC ONE

02:37:00.978 --> 02:37:02.846
TWO, THREE. WE CAN PUT IT ON A

02:37:02.913 --> 02:37:04.681
HOT LIST. AND THERE YOU GO. AND

02:37:04.748 --> 02:37:05.883
WE'D BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE

02:37:05.949 --> 02:37:07.684
BILL FOR 60 DAYS. THE CHALLENGE

02:37:07.751 --> 02:37:09.119
IS WHEN YOU'RE WORKING A COLD

02:37:09.186 --> 02:37:11.555
CASE, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU COME BACK

02:37:11.622 --> 02:37:12.890
THREE YEARS LATER AND SAY, HEY,

02:37:12.956 --> 02:37:15.392
WE HAVE EVIDENCE THAT A BLACK

02:37:15.459 --> 02:37:16.794
FORD CROSSED THE GOLDEN GATE

02:37:16.860 --> 02:37:19.429
BRIDGE. WE'D LIKE TO SEE IF ANY

02:37:19.496 --> 02:37:21.632
CARS MATCHING THAT DESCRIPTION

02:37:21.698 --> 02:37:25.335
DID SO WITH. WITH THIS BILL OR

02:37:25.402 --> 02:37:26.804
POLICY IN PLACE, IT'D BE

02:37:26.870 --> 02:37:28.305
IMPOSSIBLE TO DO SO. FOR THOSE

02:37:28.372 --> 02:37:30.040
REASONS, WE'D ASK FOR A NO VOTE.

02:37:30.107 --> 02:37:31.942
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. LEÓN

02:37:32.009 --> 02:37:33.110
AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS

02:37:33.177 --> 02:37:33.977
JONATHAN FELDMAN WITH THE

02:37:34.044 --> 02:37:36.013
CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS

02:37:36.079 --> 02:37:36.914
ASSOCIATION. I ECHO THE COMMENTS

02:37:36.980 --> 02:37:38.782
OF MY COLLEAGUE, BUT I ALSO WANT

02:37:38.849 --> 02:37:40.184
TO JUST START BY SAYING, YOU

02:37:40.250 --> 02:37:42.219
KNOW, I UNDERSTAND AND SO DO THE

02:37:42.286 --> 02:37:43.086
POLICE CHIEFS. THE UNDERLYING

02:37:43.153 --> 02:37:44.721
ISSUES HERE, PRIVACY AND IN THIS

02:37:44.788 --> 02:37:45.389
MOMENT, IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT.

02:37:45.455 --> 02:37:47.324
YOU KNOW, I REPRESENT CALIFORNIA

02:37:47.391 --> 02:37:48.992
LAW ENFORCEMENT, YOUR POLICE

02:37:49.059 --> 02:37:50.160
CHIEFS, THEY ARE IMMIGRANTS

02:37:50.227 --> 02:37:51.195
THEMSELVES. A LOT OF THE TIMES,

02:37:51.261 --> 02:37:54.431
EACH ONE OF THEM IS IMPACTED BY

02:37:54.498 --> 02:37:55.065
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT. SO IN

02:37:55.132 --> 02:37:55.933
THIS MOMENT, IN THIS TIME THAT

02:37:55.999 --> 02:37:57.234
WE'RE WORKING THROUGH, YOU KNOW,

02:37:57.301 --> 02:37:59.837
I UNDERSTAND AND EMPATHIZE WITH

02:37:59.903 --> 02:38:00.804
EVERYTHING THAT EVERY COMMUNITY

02:38:00.871 --> 02:38:02.673
IS DEALING WITH. AND THE POLICE

02:38:02.739 --> 02:38:04.775
CHIEFS ASSOCIATION HAS A TRACK

02:38:04.842 --> 02:38:06.043
RECORD OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS

02:38:06.109 --> 02:38:07.678
THAT I'VE REPRESENTED THEM FROM

02:38:07.744 --> 02:38:09.112
WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE

02:38:09.179 --> 02:38:10.948
LEGISLATURE TO SET MEANINGFUL

02:38:11.014 --> 02:38:12.416
BOUNDARIES THAT STILL ALLOW FOR

02:38:12.482 --> 02:38:13.483
IMPORTANT LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:38:13.550 --> 02:38:14.551
OPERATIONS AND THE UTILIZATION

02:38:14.618 --> 02:38:17.120
OF THESE INVESTIGATIVE TOOLS.

02:38:17.187 --> 02:38:17.754
UNFORTUNATELY, I DON'T THINK THE

02:38:17.821 --> 02:38:20.057
BILL, AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW

02:38:20.123 --> 02:38:20.724
STRIKES THAT BALANCE. IT DOES

02:38:20.791 --> 02:38:21.758
IMPROVE SOME OVERSIGHT, BUT

02:38:21.825 --> 02:38:22.960
HONESTLY, I THINK THERE'S MORE

02:38:23.026 --> 02:38:24.761
THAT CAN BE DONE AND WILLING TO

02:38:24.828 --> 02:38:25.796
HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH

02:38:25.863 --> 02:38:27.497
ANYONE THAT'S INTERESTED. BUT

02:38:27.564 --> 02:38:30.767
WHEN IT COMES TO THE DELETION OF

02:38:30.834 --> 02:38:33.370
PERMANENTLY THE INFORMATION THAT

02:38:33.437 --> 02:38:34.404
HELPS SOLVE THESE CRIMES

02:38:34.471 --> 02:38:35.906
MURDERS, RAPES, ROBBERIES,

02:38:35.973 --> 02:38:36.807
KIDNAPINGS, THESE AREN'T, YOU

02:38:36.874 --> 02:38:39.042
KNOW, ANECDOTES. THESE AREN'T

02:38:39.109 --> 02:38:40.544
HYPOTHETICALS. THIS IS REAL.

02:38:40.611 --> 02:38:41.845
ACROSS THE COUNTRY, OVER A

02:38:41.912 --> 02:38:44.882
MILLION CRIMES ARE SOLVED BY

02:38:44.948 --> 02:38:46.950
ALPR DATA. AND IN THE STATE

02:38:47.017 --> 02:38:48.418
ALONE, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:38:48.485 --> 02:38:50.654
PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN SAVED,

02:38:50.721 --> 02:38:51.688
PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN

02:38:51.755 --> 02:38:53.624
EXONERATED, WHO HAVE USED IT AS

02:38:53.690 --> 02:38:54.958
ALIBIS TO KEEP THEMSELVES OUT OF

02:38:55.025 --> 02:38:56.593
TROUBLE IN THE FIRST PLACE. THIS

02:38:56.660 --> 02:38:57.728
DATA IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT.

02:38:57.794 --> 02:38:59.429
IT'S WHY WE'RE HERE WITH SUCH

02:38:59.496 --> 02:39:01.899
SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT RETENTION

02:39:01.965 --> 02:39:03.700
POLICY THAT SETS IT ARBITRARILY

02:39:03.767 --> 02:39:04.768
AT A NUMBER THAT, YOU KNOW, WE

02:39:04.835 --> 02:39:07.170
DON'T THINK IS GOING TO CREATE

02:39:07.237 --> 02:39:08.872
THE TYPE OF BALANCE THAT I'M

02:39:08.939 --> 02:39:10.207
TALKING OF, THAT THAT

02:39:10.274 --> 02:39:10.974
MEANINGFULLY PROTECTS THE

02:39:11.041 --> 02:39:12.509
PUBLIC, BUT ALSO GIVES LAW

02:39:12.576 --> 02:39:13.777
ENFORCEMENT THE TOOLS THAT THEY

02:39:13.844 --> 02:39:17.114
NEED TO CONTINUE TO PROTECT EACH

02:39:17.180 --> 02:39:18.749
AND ONE OF EACH AND EVERY ONE OF

02:39:18.815 --> 02:39:20.217
YOUR COMMUNITIES. AGAIN, I

02:39:20.284 --> 02:39:21.184
APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S TIME. WE

02:39:21.251 --> 02:39:22.586
HAVE OFFERED AMENDMENTS TO TRY

02:39:22.653 --> 02:39:23.820
AND CREATE A BETTER BALANCE.

02:39:23.887 --> 02:39:25.155
WE'LL CONTINUE TO TALK TO THE

02:39:25.222 --> 02:39:26.490
AUTHOR'S OFFICE AND FUTURE

02:39:26.556 --> 02:39:27.958
COMMITTEES AS THE BILL MOVES

02:39:28.025 --> 02:39:30.160
FORWARD. BUT AS IT STANDS NOW,

02:39:30.227 --> 02:39:32.663
WE ARE VERY STRONGLY OPPOSED.

YOUR YOUR PRESENTATION AND FOR

02:40:45.836 --> 02:40:47.771
YOUR CONCERN REGARDING THE DATA

AND THE PRIVACY AND HOW THESE

02:40:49.473 --> 02:40:51.575
THESE THINGS ARE USED. I WANT TO

02:40:51.641 --> 02:40:54.044
START OFF BY SAYING THAT IN MY

02:40:54.111 --> 02:40:55.178
COMMUNITY, MY HISTORY, I'VE

02:40:55.245 --> 02:40:57.314
ACTUALLY SUPPORTED THE FLOCK

02:40:57.381 --> 02:40:59.216
CAMERAS, HELPED CONNECT SEVERAL

02:40:59.282 --> 02:41:00.150
CITIES, HELPED FUND OUR

02:41:00.217 --> 02:41:01.151
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT, GET

02:41:01.218 --> 02:41:02.786
FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDING FOR

02:41:02.853 --> 02:41:05.255
THESE. WE'VE USED THEM TO STOP

02:41:05.322 --> 02:41:07.858
CRIMES ON FARMS, CATALYTIC

02:41:07.924 --> 02:41:08.792
CONVERTER THEFT, ETCETERA,

02:41:08.859 --> 02:41:10.594
ETCETERA. WITH THAT SAID, I'M

02:41:10.660 --> 02:41:12.429
REALLY CURIOUS AS TO THE

02:41:12.496 --> 02:41:14.164
OPPOSITION IN REGARDS TO WHAT DO

02:41:14.231 --> 02:41:16.199
YOU THINK IS A REASONABLE AMOUNT

02:41:16.266 --> 02:41:19.870
OF TIME TO STORE DATA THAT SOME

02:41:19.936 --> 02:41:21.671
PEOPLE YOU KNOW, WHO ARE NOT

02:41:21.738 --> 02:41:22.939
COMMITTING CRIMES, WHO ARE JUST,

02:41:23.006 --> 02:41:24.641
YOU KNOW, TRAVELING ABOUT THEIR

02:41:24.708 --> 02:41:26.943
THEIR DAYS? HOW LONG DO YOU

02:41:27.010 --> 02:41:28.845
THINK IS REASONABLE TO KEEP

02:41:28.912 --> 02:41:30.747
THAT? BECAUSE WHEN WE USE IT IN

02:41:30.814 --> 02:41:32.549
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CRIME

02:41:32.616 --> 02:41:33.150
FIGHTING, NORMALLY, YOU KNOW,

02:41:33.216 --> 02:41:34.851
SOMETHING HAPPENS AND YOU'RE

02:41:34.918 --> 02:41:36.820
LOOKING YOU'RE ARE YOU GOING TO

02:41:36.887 --> 02:41:38.088
GO, YOU KNOW, SOMEONE COMMITS A

02:41:38.155 --> 02:41:40.057
CRIME AND YOU WANT TO GO BACK

02:41:40.123 --> 02:41:42.426
OVER THE DATA FROM THREE YEARS

02:41:42.492 --> 02:41:43.260
AGO OVER THE BAY BRIDGE OR LIKE

02:41:43.326 --> 02:41:45.462
WHAT WHAT'S REASONABLE IN YOUR

02:41:45.529 --> 02:41:46.563
OPINION? YEAH. THANKS FOR THAT

02:41:46.630 --> 02:41:48.465
QUESTION. I WANT TO FIRST START

02:41:48.532 --> 02:41:51.401
BY SAYING THAT I THINK A LOT OF

02:41:51.468 --> 02:41:52.702
THE ISSUES AT HAND ARE FAILURES

02:41:52.769 --> 02:41:54.104
TO COMPLY WITH EXISTING LAW. AND

02:41:54.171 --> 02:41:56.073
SO IF WE LOOK AT BETTER

02:41:56.139 --> 02:41:56.940
ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAW, WE

02:41:57.007 --> 02:41:59.376
CAN GET AT SOME OF THE ISSUES

02:41:59.443 --> 02:42:00.777
THAT WERE MENTIONED EARLIER. BUT

02:42:00.844 --> 02:42:03.480
WHEN IT COMES TO SETTING THAT

02:42:03.547 --> 02:42:04.381
NUMBER, IT'S BEEN REALLY HARD TO

02:42:04.448 --> 02:42:06.016
GET A COALITION OF 335 POLICE

02:42:06.083 --> 02:42:07.184
CHIEFS AND SHERIFFS TO COME UP

02:42:07.250 --> 02:42:08.919
WITH AN ACTUAL NUMBER, THE

02:42:08.985 --> 02:42:10.487
AMENDMENTS THAT WE HAD OFFERED

02:42:10.554 --> 02:42:11.855
TO THE AUTHOR AND PUT FORWARD TO

02:42:11.922 --> 02:42:14.257
THE COMMITTEE CREATED SORT OF A

02:42:14.324 --> 02:42:15.392
BIFURCATED SYSTEM WHERE THERE

02:42:15.459 --> 02:42:17.294
WAS GENERAL ACCESS TO YOUR RANK

02:42:17.360 --> 02:42:19.196
AND FILE OFFICERS FOR A CERTAIN

02:42:19.262 --> 02:42:20.397
PERIOD OF TIME. AND THEN AFTER

02:42:20.464 --> 02:42:22.933
THAT POINT IN TIME, ALL THE DATA

02:42:22.999 --> 02:42:25.235
WOULD GO INTO A LOCKBOX WHERE

02:42:25.302 --> 02:42:26.837
ONLY AN ADMINISTRATOR WOULD HAVE

02:42:26.903 --> 02:42:27.704
ACCESS TO IT. SO THINK OF YOUR

02:42:27.771 --> 02:42:29.005
POLICE CHIEF OR THEIR COMMAND

02:42:29.072 --> 02:42:30.874
STAFF, AND ONLY IN RESPONSE TO

02:42:30.941 --> 02:42:31.942
AN ENUMERATED CRIME BEING

02:42:32.008 --> 02:42:33.243
INVESTIGATED AT THAT MOMENT, SO

02:42:33.310 --> 02:42:35.512
THAT DATA IS PROTECTED. ONLY AN

02:42:35.579 --> 02:42:37.314
ADMINISTRATOR HAS ACCESS TO IT,

02:42:37.380 --> 02:42:39.816
AND ONLY IF THERE'S AN ACTIVE

02:42:39.883 --> 02:42:41.384
INVESTIGATION GOING ON TO NOT

02:42:41.451 --> 02:42:42.385
ANY CRIME, YOU KNOW, NOT LOW

02:42:42.452 --> 02:42:43.887
LEVEL MINOR INFRACTIONS. BUT

02:42:43.954 --> 02:42:45.622
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE MORE

02:42:45.689 --> 02:42:47.424
SERIOUS CRIMES THAT WE ARE SO

02:42:47.491 --> 02:42:49.459
CONCERNED ABOUT SOLVING. THE

02:42:49.526 --> 02:42:51.094
DRAFT AMENDMENTS THAT WE PUT

02:42:51.161 --> 02:42:53.230
FORWARD WERE DRAFTED BASED OFF

02:42:53.296 --> 02:42:55.098
OF LAPD'S POLICY, WHICH IS A TWO

02:42:55.165 --> 02:42:57.067
YEAR GENERAL ACCESS, AND THEN AN

02:42:57.134 --> 02:42:58.735
ADDITIONAL THREE YEARS, WHICH IS

02:42:58.802 --> 02:43:00.470
LONG TIME, RIGHT, FIVE YEARS

02:43:00.537 --> 02:43:02.172
TOTAL. OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S MUCH

02:43:02.239 --> 02:43:05.509
LONGER THAN 60 DAYS. BUT AGAIN,

02:43:05.575 --> 02:43:06.877
THE ASSOCIATION HAS A TRACK

02:43:06.943 --> 02:43:08.145
RECORD OF NEGOTIATING THROUGH

02:43:08.211 --> 02:43:10.147
THESE TOUGH, DIFFICULT ISSUES.

02:43:10.213 --> 02:43:10.881
OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW, THERE'S A

02:43:10.947 --> 02:43:13.250
DATE THAT WE HAVE SET. THERE'S A

02:43:13.316 --> 02:43:15.185
DATE IN THE BILL RIGHT NOW AND

02:43:15.252 --> 02:43:16.386
THERE'S A BUNCH OF DATES IN THE

02:43:16.453 --> 02:43:18.455
MIDDLE. AND WE HOPE TO

02:43:18.522 --> 02:43:19.823
ULTIMATELY, I'D SAY I'VE HAD

02:43:19.890 --> 02:43:20.891
THIS DEBATE AROUND RETENTION

02:43:20.957 --> 02:43:23.260
POLICIES EVERY YEAR FOR FOUR

02:43:23.326 --> 02:43:24.895
YEARS NOW. IT KIND OF FEELS LIKE

02:43:24.961 --> 02:43:27.097
IT'S TIME TO SETTLE THIS ONE.

02:43:27.164 --> 02:43:30.634
AND SO I HOPE WE CAN GET TO A

02:43:30.700 --> 02:43:32.435
NUMBER. I JUST, YOU KNOW, I, I

02:43:32.502 --> 02:43:33.136
UNDERSTAND WE'RE RUNNING SHORT

02:43:33.203 --> 02:43:34.771
ON TIME HERE AND THAT THERE'S

02:43:34.838 --> 02:43:36.206
BEEN OTHER COMMITTEES THAT HAVE

02:43:36.273 --> 02:43:37.974
WEIGHED IN AND OTHER COMMITTEES

02:43:38.041 --> 02:43:39.209
THAT WILL WEIGH IN THAT MIGHT

02:43:39.276 --> 02:43:39.943
NOT AGREE WITH WHAT WE'VE

02:43:40.010 --> 02:43:42.512
PROPOSED, BUT WE'RE GOING TO

02:43:42.579 --> 02:43:43.113
KEEP TRYING. OKAY. AND DID OUR

02:43:43.180 --> 02:43:44.080
REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE

02:43:44.147 --> 02:43:44.681
SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION WANT TO

02:43:44.748 --> 02:43:47.117
CHIME IN ON THAT? SURE. I, I

02:43:47.184 --> 02:43:49.252
LARGELY AGREE WITH WHAT MY

02:43:49.319 --> 02:43:50.787
COLLEAGUE SAID. WE HAVE NOT, ON

02:43:50.854 --> 02:43:51.855
BEHALF OF THE SHERIFF'S, BEEN

02:43:51.922 --> 02:43:54.090
ABLE TO COME UP WITH A TIME TO

02:43:54.157 --> 02:43:55.158
WHERE WE'RE COMFORTABLE IN

02:43:55.225 --> 02:43:56.860
SAYING AFTER X DAYS OR MONTHS OR

02:43:56.927 --> 02:43:57.894
YEARS, WE'RE OKAY WITH

02:43:57.961 --> 02:43:59.629
DESTROYING THAT INFORMATION

02:43:59.696 --> 02:44:00.697
BECAUSE AGAIN, IT'S PICTURES OF

02:44:00.764 --> 02:44:03.767
LICENSE PLATES. OKAY. AND THEN

02:44:03.833 --> 02:44:06.369
I'M SORRY TO GO BACK. I KNOW

02:44:06.436 --> 02:44:07.003
YOU'RE REPRESENTING THE CHIEFS.

02:44:07.070 --> 02:44:09.506
YOU MENTIONED THAT ENFORCEMENT

02:44:09.573 --> 02:44:10.740
THERE'S ISSUES WITH ENFORCEMENT

02:44:10.807 --> 02:44:12.075
IS THAT ENFORCEMENT OF PEOPLE

02:44:12.142 --> 02:44:14.411
WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE MANAGING

02:44:14.477 --> 02:44:17.180
THE DATA AND THE INFORMATION?

02:44:17.247 --> 02:44:18.882
YEAH. I CAN'T I DON'T WANT TO

02:44:18.949 --> 02:44:20.584
GET TOO FAR AHEAD OF MY CLIENT

02:44:20.650 --> 02:44:22.385
HERE. BUT OBVIOUSLY WE'VE HAD

02:44:22.452 --> 02:44:23.019
AUDITS AND WE'VE HAD CALMATTERS

02:44:23.086 --> 02:44:24.054
ARTICLES THAT HAVE POINTED OUT,

02:44:24.120 --> 02:44:26.256
YOU KNOW, MAYBE SOME MISUSE. AND

02:44:26.323 --> 02:44:27.724
I WILL SAY ON THE CALMATTERS

02:44:27.791 --> 02:44:29.092
ARTICLE, I'VE TALKED TO A LOT OF

02:44:29.159 --> 02:44:30.727
THOSE AGENCIES, AND THEY HAVE

02:44:30.794 --> 02:44:32.596
PUSHED BACK ON SOME OF THE

02:44:32.662 --> 02:44:33.830
FINDINGS AND REPORTING THAT CAME

02:44:33.897 --> 02:44:35.065
THROUGH THAT ARTICLE. BUT, YOU

02:44:35.131 --> 02:44:36.499
KNOW, OBVIOUSLY COMPLIANCE IS

02:44:36.566 --> 02:44:38.435
IMPORTANT. I CAN'T DENY THAT

02:44:38.501 --> 02:44:44.040
THERE HAVE BEEN EXAMPLES CLEARLY

02:44:44.107 --> 02:44:45.909
EXHIBITED WHERE THERE WAS A LACK

02:44:45.976 --> 02:44:47.677
OF COMPLIANCE. SO HOW DO YOU

02:44:47.744 --> 02:44:49.846
ENSURE COMPLIANCE? HOW DO YOU

02:44:49.913 --> 02:44:51.648
AUDIT THAT COMPLIANCE? HOW IS

02:44:51.715 --> 02:44:52.315
THERE TRANSPARENCY TO MAKE SURE

02:44:52.382 --> 02:44:54.784
THAT THE LAW. WE HAVE A LOT OF

02:44:54.851 --> 02:44:56.419
ROBUST LAWS ON THE BOOKS RIGHT

02:44:56.486 --> 02:44:58.855
NOW GOVERNING GOVERNING ALPR

02:44:58.922 --> 02:45:00.624
DATA SYSTEMS AND THE USAGE. I

02:45:00.690 --> 02:45:01.791
MEAN, I THINK STEP ONE IS TO

02:45:01.858 --> 02:45:03.460
MAKE SURE THAT, YOU KNOW,

02:45:03.526 --> 02:45:05.595
THERE'S A UNIVERSAL COMPLIANCE

02:45:05.662 --> 02:45:07.864
WITH THOSE LAWS. LOOK TO FIND

02:45:07.931 --> 02:45:09.933
THE GAPS AT THAT POINT AND

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:11.801
AGAIN, TRY AND BALANCE OUT THE

02:45:11.868 --> 02:45:13.703
PRIMARY CONCERN THAT, YOU KNOW,

02:45:13.770 --> 02:45:14.971
POLICE CHIEFS AND THE SHERIFFS

02:45:15.038 --> 02:45:17.240
SHARE. AWESOME. THANK YOU. I WAS

02:45:17.307 --> 02:45:18.808
HOPING TO HEAR LIKE A REASONABLE

02:45:18.875 --> 02:45:19.976
LIKE TIME FRAME BECAUSE AS

02:45:20.043 --> 02:45:21.811
SOMEONE WHO DOES SUPPORT THE USE

02:45:21.878 --> 02:45:24.080
OF THE FLOCK CAMERAS, I WAS

02:45:24.147 --> 02:45:26.182
HOPING YOU HAD LIKE, YOU KNOW,

02:45:26.249 --> 02:45:28.318
HEY, WE WANT SIX MONTHS OR

02:45:28.385 --> 02:45:29.419
SOMETHING REASONABLE, BUT

02:45:29.486 --> 02:45:30.787
PERPETUITY LOCK BOXES, THOSE

02:45:30.854 --> 02:45:34.157
THINGS GIVE ME ANGST. GIVEN THE

02:45:34.224 --> 02:45:37.360
MISUSE OF THIS TOOL. AND YOU'RE

02:45:37.427 --> 02:45:39.496
JUST KIND OF THIS RETROACTIVE

02:45:39.562 --> 02:45:42.432
APPROACH. SO I DO APPRECIATE YOU

02:45:42.499 --> 02:45:44.501

UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN YOU

02:45:45.635 --> 02:45:46.803
REPRESENT SO MANY HUNDREDS OF

02:45:46.870 --> 02:45:47.837
PEOPLE, YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BE

02:45:47.904 --> 02:45:50.173
ABLE TO HONE IN ON A RESPONSE.

02:45:50.240 --> 02:45:51.975
BUT I DO APPRECIATE YOU GIVING

02:45:52.042 --> 02:45:53.610
ME THOSE ANSWERS. THANK YOU. ALL

02:45:53.677 --> 02:45:55.578
RIGHT. LOWENTHAL. THANK YOU,

02:45:55.645 --> 02:45:57.480
MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY

02:45:57.547 --> 02:45:58.882
MUCH, SENATOR, FOR BRINGING THIS

02:45:58.948 --> 02:46:00.050
FORWARD. I'D LIKE TO BE

02:46:00.116 --> 02:46:00.884
CONSIDERED A COAUTHOR ON THE

02:46:00.950 --> 02:46:02.886
BILL, IF YOU'LL HAVE ME IN THE

02:46:02.952 --> 02:46:04.688
PAST, AS YOU REMEMBER, RAN A

02:46:04.754 --> 02:46:07.524
SIMILAR BILL. I THINK THAT 60

02:46:07.590 --> 02:46:09.025
DAYS IS MORE THAN REASONABLE

02:46:09.092 --> 02:46:10.527
AMOUNT OF TIME. THE COMPANY

02:46:10.593 --> 02:46:11.494
THAT'S ACTUALLY PUTTING THIS

02:46:11.561 --> 02:46:13.363
FORWARD RECOMMENDED 30 DAYS.

02:46:13.430 --> 02:46:15.198
THERE ARE STATES THAT HAVE ONLY

02:46:15.265 --> 02:46:16.966
A MATTER OF HOURS, I BELIEVE,

02:46:17.033 --> 02:46:18.735
NEW HAMPSHIRE BEING ONE OF THOSE

02:46:18.802 --> 02:46:21.204
STATES, YOU DON'T SEE IT IN

02:46:21.271 --> 02:46:22.872
MASSIVE SPIKE IN CRIME SINCE

02:46:22.939 --> 02:46:24.174
THEY IMPLEMENTED THAT

02:46:24.240 --> 02:46:26.876
WHATSOEVER. I THINK UTILIZING

02:46:26.943 --> 02:46:29.212
THE SUGGESTION THAT WE ARE GOING

02:46:29.279 --> 02:46:30.780
TO HAVE MORE CRIME AS A RESULT

02:46:30.847 --> 02:46:32.949
OF THIS FALLS EMPTY. WITH ME

02:46:33.016 --> 02:46:33.983
PERSONALLY, AS MUCH AS I RESPECT

02:46:34.050 --> 02:46:36.086
THE POLICE CHIEFS AND THE

02:46:36.152 --> 02:46:37.987
SHERIFFS FOR ALL THE WORK THAT

02:46:38.054 --> 02:46:39.923
THEY DO IN THIS GREAT STATE,

02:46:39.989 --> 02:46:41.925
TRACKING ALL OF OUR MOVEMENT ALL

02:46:41.991 --> 02:46:44.027
THE TIME WOULD CUT DOWN ON A LOT

02:46:44.094 --> 02:46:46.463
OF CRIME, TRACKING ALL OF OUR

02:46:46.529 --> 02:46:47.931
COMMUNICATIONS ON THE REGULAR

02:46:47.997 --> 02:46:50.767
ALL THE TIME WOULD CUT DOWN ON A

02:46:50.834 --> 02:46:52.435
LOT OF CRIME. AND THE QUESTION

02:46:52.502 --> 02:46:53.069
IS, WHAT TYPE OF SOCIETY DO WE

02:46:53.136 --> 02:46:54.804
WANT TO HAVE? WHAT TYPE OF

02:46:54.871 --> 02:46:56.005
RIGHTS DO WE WANT TO HAVE? AND

02:46:56.072 --> 02:46:58.375
WHO OWNS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

02:46:58.441 --> 02:46:59.376
OVER OUR OWN MOVEMENT? MOVEMENT,

02:46:59.442 --> 02:47:01.911
FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT AS A WHOLE.

02:47:01.978 --> 02:47:04.414
AND I THINK THAT WE DO. AND SO I

02:47:04.481 --> 02:47:06.249
HAVE NO PROBLEM FUNDAMENTALLY

02:47:06.316 --> 02:47:09.085
WITH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. BUT

02:47:09.152 --> 02:47:10.720
ANYTHING BEYOND THAT, I THINK,

02:47:10.787 --> 02:47:11.988
INFRINGES ON OUR RIGHTS AND IS

02:47:12.055 --> 02:47:14.224
JUST NOT THE SOCIETY THAT I

02:47:14.290 --> 02:47:15.225
THINK WE WANT TO HAVE.

02:47:15.291 --> 02:47:15.892
FURTHERMORE, YOU KNOW, WHEN THIS

02:47:15.959 --> 02:47:17.994
BILL WAS BEING RUN IN THE PAST,

02:47:18.061 --> 02:47:19.629
IT WAS IT WAS NOT A

02:47:19.696 --> 02:47:20.730
CONSIDERATION OUT OF IMMIGRANT

02:47:20.797 --> 02:47:22.799
STATUS AND ENFORCEMENT ISSUES.

02:47:22.866 --> 02:47:24.033
ACTUALLY, THE HOT BUTTON ISSUE

02:47:24.100 --> 02:47:26.803
AT THAT TIME WAS REPRODUCTIVE

02:47:26.870 --> 02:47:29.639
JUSTICE. AND WHERE IF THERE WERE

02:47:29.706 --> 02:47:31.040
WOMEN IN PARTICULAR, COMING FROM

02:47:31.107 --> 02:47:33.610
OUT OF STATE TO SEEK

02:47:33.676 --> 02:47:35.345
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE HERE IN

02:47:35.412 --> 02:47:36.579
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, THAT

02:47:36.646 --> 02:47:37.814
THERE WOULDN'T BE REPERCUSSIONS

02:47:37.881 --> 02:47:39.816
AGAINST THEM. AND WE FOUND THAT

02:47:39.883 --> 02:47:42.285
THERE WERE CASES WHERE THAT WAS

02:47:42.352 --> 02:47:44.087
NOT THE CASE, WHERE LAW

02:47:44.154 --> 02:47:46.156
ENFORCEMENT WAS TAKING THAT DATA

02:47:46.222 --> 02:47:47.957
ILLEGALLY AND USING IT

02:47:48.024 --> 02:47:49.325
OTHERWISE. AND SO I THINK THAT

02:47:49.392 --> 02:47:51.194
BREACHES ARE SOMETHING THAT WE

02:47:51.261 --> 02:47:52.662
DO HAVE TO CONSIDER BECAUSE

02:47:52.729 --> 02:47:53.263
THERE IS PRECEDENT ASSOCIATED

02:47:53.329 --> 02:47:54.831
WITH THIS. I THINK THAT IS

02:47:54.898 --> 02:47:56.599
INCUMBENT UPON THE STATE OF

02:47:56.666 --> 02:47:58.535
CALIFORNIA TO BE INSISTING ON

02:47:58.601 --> 02:48:00.036
HAVING LAWS THAT ARE GOING TO

02:48:00.103 --> 02:48:01.271
PROTECT AGAINST SOME OF THE

02:48:01.337 --> 02:48:03.106
ACTIONS OF THE CURRENT

02:48:03.173 --> 02:48:04.240
ADMINISTRATION, THE FEDERAL

02:48:04.307 --> 02:48:05.408
GOVERNMENT. AND I THINK THAT

02:48:05.475 --> 02:48:06.743
THIS IS BEDROCK IN THEM. AND I'M

02:48:06.810 --> 02:48:08.645
VERY PROUD OF YOU, SENATOR, FOR

02:48:08.711 --> 02:48:10.713
BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. I'M

02:48:10.780 --> 02:48:14.517
HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT TODAY. ALL

02:48:14.584 --> 02:48:16.386
RIGHT. WE HAVE A MOTION BY

02:48:16.453 --> 02:48:18.354
JACKSON AND A SECOND BY WAS THAT

02:48:18.421 --> 02:48:21.191
LOWENTHAL Þ HARP I APOLOGIZE, A

02:48:21.257 --> 02:48:23.259
MOTION BY JACKSON AND A SECOND

02:48:23.326 --> 02:48:25.829
BY HART. MOVING ON TO OTHER

02:48:25.895 --> 02:48:26.496
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE.

02:48:26.563 --> 02:48:29.432
LACKEY. YEAH. WITH ALL DUE

02:48:29.499 --> 02:48:31.935
RESPECT, I COULDN'T BE MORE

02:48:32.001 --> 02:48:33.236
OPPOSED TO SOME OF THE THINGS

02:48:33.303 --> 02:48:35.572
I'VE HEARD ON THIS PARTICULAR

02:48:35.638 --> 02:48:39.742
BILL SO FAR. I THINK IT'S

02:48:39.809 --> 02:48:41.344
INCREDIBLY UNREASONABLE TO

02:48:41.411 --> 02:48:45.181
VICTIMS. THE USE OF THIS, THIS

02:48:45.248 --> 02:48:46.683
TECHNOLOGY. I BELIEVE IT SHOULD

02:48:46.749 --> 02:48:49.853
BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR MISUSE.

02:48:49.919 --> 02:48:51.421
BUT I DO THINK THAT THE MISUSE

02:48:51.488 --> 02:48:54.023
OF THIS TECHNOLOGY IS MORE THE

02:48:54.090 --> 02:48:59.128
EXCEPTION AND BE TAKEN ON AS

02:48:59.195 --> 02:49:02.031
MISCONDUCT. BUT I DON'T THINK

02:49:02.098 --> 02:49:07.537
IT'S FAIR TO. VICTIMS OF VIOLENT

02:49:07.604 --> 02:49:10.940
CRIME BECAUSE THIS TOOL IS

02:49:11.007 --> 02:49:13.676
DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR HOLDING

02:49:13.743 --> 02:49:15.945
PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR

02:49:16.012 --> 02:49:17.680
MISCONDUCT AND THEIR ABUSE OF

02:49:17.747 --> 02:49:22.185
PEOPLE. AND HERE'S THE REALITY

02:49:22.252 --> 02:49:24.320
IS THAT CRIMINAL THREATS DON'T

02:49:24.387 --> 02:49:27.657
ALWAYS SURFACE WITHIN 60 DAYS.

02:49:27.724 --> 02:49:33.763
THEY JUST DON'T. THEY. AND

02:49:33.830 --> 02:49:35.265
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS ARE

02:49:35.331 --> 02:49:37.300
AWFULLY OFTEN MISCHARACTERIZED

02:49:37.367 --> 02:49:39.836
AND QUITE FRANKLY, NOT

02:49:39.903 --> 02:49:41.738
UNDERSTOOD. BUT WHEN YOU'RE A

02:49:41.804 --> 02:49:43.773
VICTIM OF ONE OF THOSE CRIMES,

02:49:43.840 --> 02:49:46.075
YOU NEED THAT CLOSURE AND YOU

02:49:46.142 --> 02:49:47.710
DESERVE THAT CLOSURE. AND

02:49:47.777 --> 02:49:52.448
ANYTIME WE RIP A TOOL AWAY OR

02:49:52.515 --> 02:49:55.285
ALLOW IT TO DISAPPEAR OVER THIS

02:49:55.351 --> 02:49:57.954
ARBITRARY DETERMINATION OF 60

02:49:58.021 --> 02:50:00.590
DAYS, WHERE DOES THAT COME FROM?

02:50:00.657 --> 02:50:01.858
BY THE WAY, WHAT KIND OF DATA

02:50:01.925 --> 02:50:04.994
SUPPORTS THE 60 DAY PIECE? I

02:50:05.061 --> 02:50:09.399
FIND THAT TO BE VERY PERPLEXING.

02:50:09.465 --> 02:50:10.867
ANOTHER THING THAT'S NOT

02:50:10.934 --> 02:50:12.702
CONSIDERED IS A LOT OF TIMES I

02:50:12.769 --> 02:50:14.070
DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF

02:50:14.137 --> 02:50:16.973
TIMES, BUT THERE ARE INSTANCES

02:50:17.040 --> 02:50:20.109
THAT ACTUALLY PROVE INNOCENCE

02:50:20.176 --> 02:50:25.648
AND FALSE SUSPICIONS. SO THIS IS

02:50:25.715 --> 02:50:28.184
A RELATIVELY OBJECTIVE. A CAMERA

02:50:28.251 --> 02:50:30.987
IS PRETTY OBJECTIVE IN ALL

02:50:31.054 --> 02:50:33.656
TRUTH, AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND

02:50:33.723 --> 02:50:35.925
WHY WE WOULD RIP AWAY SUCH A

02:50:35.992 --> 02:50:40.697
VALUABLE TOOL THAT IS SO

02:50:40.763 --> 02:50:42.131
OBJECTIVE. BECAUSE WE HAVE A

02:50:42.198 --> 02:50:43.366
CONCERN, AND I DO THINK WE

02:50:43.433 --> 02:50:44.867
SHOULD BE CONCERNED WHEN THERE'S

02:50:44.934 --> 02:50:47.837
MISUSE, AND WE SHOULD HOLD THOSE

02:50:47.904 --> 02:50:49.005
PEOPLE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

02:50:49.072 --> 02:50:51.174
THAT MISUSE ACCOUNTABLE, BUT

02:50:51.240 --> 02:50:54.110
DON'T TAKE THE TOOL AWAY BECAUSE

02:50:54.177 --> 02:50:56.179
THAT THAT PUNISHES THE WRONG

02:50:56.245 --> 02:50:58.381
PEOPLE AND THE WRONG PEOPLE ARE

02:50:58.448 --> 02:50:59.816
VICTIMS. AND I, I HAVE A

02:50:59.882 --> 02:51:00.817
COMMITMENT TO VICTIMS BECAUSE

02:51:00.883 --> 02:51:03.052
I'VE I'M PERSONALLY ATTACHED TO

02:51:03.119 --> 02:51:05.888
MANY MEMORIES. AND I'M TELLING

02:51:05.955 --> 02:51:08.024
YOU, THIS IS REALLY WRONG

02:51:08.091 --> 02:51:09.892
HEADED. AND I I'M SYMPATHETIC TO

02:51:09.959 --> 02:51:12.729
THE CONCERN. BUT THIS IS NOT THE

02:51:12.795 --> 02:51:14.230
RIGHT APPROACH. AND THIS IS THE

02:51:14.297 --> 02:51:19.369
WRONG TOOL. AND I'M STRONGLY IN

02:51:19.435 --> 02:51:25.708
OPPOSITION. MOVING ON. I DON'T

02:51:25.775 --> 02:51:28.211
SEE ANY OTHER COMMENTS. WE DO

02:51:28.277 --> 02:51:31.147
HAVE A MOTION. SORRY. WAS THERE

02:51:31.214 --> 02:51:33.016
OH, OKAY. HAPPEN. THANK YOU SO

02:51:33.082 --> 02:51:34.450
MUCH, MADAM CHAIR. SORRY ABOUT

02:51:34.517 --> 02:51:37.654
THAT. SO I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR

02:51:37.720 --> 02:51:38.888
THE BILL TODAY. BUT I THINK IT

02:51:38.955 --> 02:51:40.790
DOES NEED TO BE TWEAKED AND

02:51:40.857 --> 02:51:42.859
MAYBE SOME OF YOUR BIFURCATION

02:51:42.925 --> 02:51:43.793
THAT YOU HAD SPOKEN ABOUT AND A

02:51:43.860 --> 02:51:45.495
SLIGHTLY LONGER TIME FRAME, I

02:51:45.561 --> 02:51:48.431
THINK IS A BIT MORE WORKABLE. SO

02:51:48.498 --> 02:51:49.932
HOPEFULLY WE'LL CONTINUE TO

02:51:49.999 --> 02:51:51.501
DISCUSS. BUT THIS IDEA OF

02:51:51.567 --> 02:51:53.036
RESTRICTING WHOSE EYES CAN BE ON

02:51:53.102 --> 02:51:55.405
THE DATA AFTER A CERTAIN POINT

02:51:55.471 --> 02:51:58.007
IN TIME DOES SEEM LIKE WE COULD

02:51:58.074 --> 02:52:00.610
SOLVE SOME OF THESE MISUSES, IF

02:52:00.677 --> 02:52:02.445
YOU WILL. SO ANYWAY, THAT'S

02:52:02.512 --> 02:52:04.914
WHERE I'M COMING FROM. I JUST

02:52:04.981 --> 02:52:06.749
DIDN'T WANT YOU TO THINK IT WAS

02:52:06.816 --> 02:52:10.720
A STRAIGHT UP VOTE. ALL RIGHT,

02:52:10.787 --> 02:52:11.988
DOUBLE CHECKING MY COMMITTEE.

02:52:12.055 --> 02:52:14.824
ALL RIGHT. MOVING MOVING ON TO

02:52:14.891 --> 02:52:17.560
MY COMMENTS. YOU KNOW, THANK YOU

02:52:17.627 --> 02:52:18.461
FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD TODAY.

02:52:18.528 --> 02:52:20.463
AS WAS NOTED, IT WAS DONE

02:52:20.530 --> 02:52:22.265
PREVIOUSLY AND I APPRECIATE THE

02:52:22.331 --> 02:52:24.367
CONCERNS BROUGHT UP BY LAW

02:52:24.434 --> 02:52:25.835
ENFORCEMENT, BUT ALSO NOTED THAT

02:52:25.902 --> 02:52:28.271
THE MAKER OF THIS PARTICULAR

02:52:28.337 --> 02:52:29.906
PROGRAM OR UTILITY HAD NOTED

02:52:29.972 --> 02:52:32.008
THAT A 30 DAY RETENTION WAS

02:52:32.075 --> 02:52:33.109
SUFFICIENT. AND WE SPENT A LOT

02:52:33.176 --> 02:52:34.944
OF TIME WHILE IT WAS IN OUR

02:52:35.011 --> 02:52:37.113
COMMITTEE TALKING ABOUT THE TIME

02:52:37.180 --> 02:52:39.515
PERIOD OF RETENTION AND HOW,

02:52:39.582 --> 02:52:42.752
GIVEN THAT THE SENATE HAD

02:52:42.819 --> 02:52:44.987
EXTENDED IT BY 60 DAYS. AND SO

02:52:45.054 --> 02:52:47.156
IN OUR COMMITTEE, WE COULD DO

02:52:47.223 --> 02:52:48.858
MORE THAN SEND SUBMIT IT LONGER.

02:52:48.925 --> 02:52:50.593
BUT ELECTED AND COOPERATION WITH

02:52:50.660 --> 02:52:51.894
THE PRIVACY COMMITTEE WHERE IT'S

02:52:51.961 --> 02:52:53.429
BEING HEARD NEXT. WHO WAS

02:52:53.496 --> 02:52:55.231
INTERESTED IN PUTTING IT AT

02:52:55.298 --> 02:52:56.899
SEVEN DAYS AND THEY COULD NOT DO

02:52:56.966 --> 02:53:01.070
THAT. AND SO WE ELECTED NOT TO

02:53:01.137 --> 02:53:02.739
EXTEND THE TIME PERIOD, EVEN

02:53:02.805 --> 02:53:04.540
THOUGH I DO UNDERSTAND THE CITY

02:53:04.607 --> 02:53:09.445
OF LA FEATURE OF HAVING A SHORT

02:53:09.512 --> 02:53:11.347
TIME PERIOD AND THEN EXTENDING

02:53:11.414 --> 02:53:13.616
IT BEYOND AND HAVING IT BEHIND

02:53:13.683 --> 02:53:15.451
ANOTHER WALL OR HURDLE OF SORTS,

02:53:15.518 --> 02:53:17.420
WHICH NOT THE FIVE YEAR TOTAL

02:53:17.487 --> 02:53:19.122
TIME PERIOD, BUT JUST THAT

02:53:19.188 --> 02:53:21.357
THEORY I SUPPORT. WE ELECTED NOT

02:53:21.424 --> 02:53:23.693
TO DO THAT IN THIS COMMITTEE.

02:53:23.760 --> 02:53:24.927
HOWEVER, AS THIS BILL, IF IT

02:53:24.994 --> 02:53:26.662
GETS OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY, I

02:53:26.729 --> 02:53:28.698
DO WANT YOU TO WORK ON A
