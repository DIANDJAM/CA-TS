THIS IS A RESOLUTION THAT IS

02:18:46.351 --> 02:18:48.286
VERY NECESSARY. IT REAFFIRMS

02:18:48.353 --> 02:18:50.255
OUR CALIFORNIA COMMITMENT TO

I AM NOT THE ONLY PERSON ON

REVISITING THIS TODAY IS

02:19:07.605 --> 02:19:08.239

02:19:09.474 --> 02:19:11.109
FIRST DAY IN OFFICE, HE SIGNED

STILL BEING FOUGHT IN THE

02:19:21.219 --> 02:19:22.353
CONSERVATIVE SUPREME COURT HAS

02:19:22.420 --> 02:19:24.422
NOT YET RULED ON THE MERITS OF

02:19:24.489 --> 02:19:25.590
THE CASE, EVEN THOUGH BLATANTLY

02:19:25.657 --> 02:19:26.658
IT IS SO UNCONSTITUTIONAL. BUT

02:19:26.725 --> 02:19:28.593
IT IS IMPORTANT REMINDER THAT

02:19:28.660 --> 02:19:30.361

ENSLAVED PEOPLE AFTER THE CIVIL

02:19:35.400 --> 02:19:37.535
WAR AND MADE WHOLE BY A CHINESE

02:19:37.602 --> 02:19:39.170
AMERICAN BORN IN SAN FRANCISCO

02:19:39.237 --> 02:19:40.405
WHO FOUGHT ALL THE WAY TO

02:19:40.472 --> 02:19:44.175
SUPREME COURT IN 1898, IS NOW

02:19:44.242 --> 02:19:45.510

AND BROWN IMMIGRANTS ACROSS

02:19:48.246 --> 02:19:50.782
ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND SO WE

02:19:50.849 --> 02:19:51.983
MUST REAFFIRM OUR COMMITMENT TO

02:19:52.050 --> 02:19:52.617
BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP, BECAUSE

02:19:52.684 --> 02:19:54.686
IF THEY CAN DENATURALIZE AND

02:19:54.753 --> 02:19:56.020
DISENFRANCHIZE CHILDREN, THEY

02:19:56.087 --> 02:19:57.589
WILL COME AFTER AND

02:19:57.655 --> 02:19:59.357
DENATURALIZE A LOT MORE PEOPLE

02:19:59.424 --> 02:20:01.192

ASK FOR YOUR VOTE TO RE

02:20:03.294 --> 02:20:04.629

02:22:14.993 --> 02:22:16.294
ATTORNEY GENERAL, WHO STRONGLY

02:22:16.361 --> 02:22:18.630
SUPPORTS THE BILL, TO

02:22:18.696 --> 02:22:19.764
INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE

02:22:19.831 --> 02:22:22.400
VIOLATORS. AS OF SPRING 2024,

02:22:22.467 --> 02:22:25.169
THERE HAVE BEEN 58 CEASE AND

02:22:25.236 --> 02:22:27.338
DESIST LETTERS SENT BY THE VA

02:22:27.405 --> 02:22:29.440
TO THESE FOR-PROFIT CLAIM

02:22:29.507 --> 02:22:32.710
PREDATORS. NATIONALLY, LETTERS

02:22:32.777 --> 02:22:35.580
THEY HAVE JUST IGNORED BECAUSE

02:22:35.647 --> 02:22:36.414
THERE'S NO ENFORCEMENT OF THESE

02:22:36.481 --> 02:22:39.250
LAWS. AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED

02:22:39.317 --> 02:22:41.319
TO CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA,

02:22:41.386 --> 02:22:43.121
VETERAN JOHN RYAN'S EXPERIENCE

02:22:43.187 --> 02:22:45.390
AS AN EXAMPLE OF WHY MR. RYAN

02:22:45.456 --> 02:22:47.191
IS A KERN COUNTY RESIDENT,

02:22:47.258 --> 02:22:49.227
RETIRED MARINE, WHO BELIEVED

02:22:49.294 --> 02:22:51.095
THAT THE BENEFITS HE EARNED

02:22:51.162 --> 02:22:53.197
WOULD BE THERE WHEN HE NEEDED

02:22:53.264 --> 02:22:54.532
THEM LAST YEAR, WHILE SEEKING

02:22:54.599 --> 02:22:56.634
HELP IN A DISABILITY CLAIM, HE

02:22:56.701 --> 02:22:59.337
WAS CONTACTED BY A COMPANY

02:22:59.404 --> 02:23:00.538
PROMISING QUICK RESULTS AND

02:23:00.605 --> 02:23:03.708
EXPERTISE WITH VA DISABILITIES.

02:23:03.775 --> 02:23:06.311
CLAIMS. WHAT THEY DID, WHAT

02:23:06.377 --> 02:23:08.413
THEY DIDN'T SAY IS THAT THEIR

02:23:08.479 --> 02:23:09.314
BUSINESS WAS AN UNACCREDITED

02:23:09.380 --> 02:23:10.415
BUSINESS AND THAT THEIR

02:23:10.481 --> 02:23:12.383
BUSINESS MODEL WAS DEPENDENT ON

02:23:12.450 --> 02:23:13.217
CHARGING VETERANS, OFTEN

02:23:13.284 --> 02:23:15.653
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS, FOR THEIR

02:23:15.720 --> 02:23:16.421
SERVICES. THAT SHOULD BE AND

02:23:16.487 --> 02:23:18.623
ARE FREE THROUGH A COUNTY

02:23:18.690 --> 02:23:21.259
VETERANS SERVICE OFFICER. THE

02:23:21.326 --> 02:23:23.661
COMPANY PITCHED ITSELF AS AN

02:23:23.728 --> 02:23:25.530
EXPERT WITH INSIDER KNOWLEDGE

02:23:25.596 --> 02:23:27.365
OF THE VA SYSTEM, WHICH IS

02:23:27.432 --> 02:23:29.367
CATEGORICALLY FALSE. THEY

02:23:29.434 --> 02:23:31.369
RUSHED HIM THROUGH PAPERWORK

02:23:31.436 --> 02:23:32.337
AND SPOKE AS IF THEY WERE

02:23:32.403 --> 02:23:34.305
WORKING DIRECTLY WITH THE VA,

02:23:34.372 --> 02:23:36.341
WHICH ALSO THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO

02:23:36.407 --> 02:23:38.843
DO. IMMEDIATELY AFTER RECEIVING

02:23:38.910 --> 02:23:40.445
A DECISION FROM THE VA, THE

02:23:40.511 --> 02:23:42.180
COMPANY SENT HIM A BILL

02:23:42.246 --> 02:23:44.682
TOTALING SIX MONTHS OF HIS CPA

02:23:44.749 --> 02:23:46.284
BENEFITS. IT DEMANDED THAT HE

02:23:46.351 --> 02:23:49.354
PAID THOSE SIX MONTHS OF

02:23:49.420 --> 02:23:50.655
BENEFITS IN THREE MONTHS OR

02:23:50.722 --> 02:23:52.790
INCUR INTEREST CHARGES HIDDEN

02:23:52.857 --> 02:23:54.592
IN THE CONTRACT TERMS. THEY

02:23:54.659 --> 02:23:57.495
EVEN GAVE HIM A CLAIM ON FUTURE

02:23:57.562 --> 02:23:59.263
BENEFITS, MEANING THAT HE IF HE

02:23:59.330 --> 02:24:01.632
GOT AN INCREASE ON BENEFITS IN

02:24:01.699 --> 02:24:03.234
THE FUTURE, EVEN IF HE DIDN'T

02:24:03.301 --> 02:24:05.603
GO THROUGH THE CLAIM SHARK,

02:24:05.670 --> 02:24:07.171
THEY WOULD GET A PERCENTAGE OF

02:24:07.238 --> 02:24:09.240
THOSE FUTURE BENEFITS. FOR A

02:24:09.307 --> 02:24:11.342
DISABLED VETERAN LIVING ON

02:24:11.409 --> 02:24:12.777
$1,600 A MONTH, THAT UNEXPECTED

02:24:12.844 --> 02:24:15.279
BILL MEANT DRAINING HIS SAVINGS

02:24:15.346 --> 02:24:18.149
COMPLETELY. SO LET'S BE CLEAR

02:24:18.216 --> 02:24:19.550
THE ACTIONS OF THESE PREDATORS

02:24:19.617 --> 02:24:21.419
WHO ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF OUR

02:24:21.486 --> 02:24:22.320
VETERANS ARE ILLEGAL AND HAVE

02:24:22.387 --> 02:24:24.655
ZERO OVERSIGHT FOR THEIR

02:24:24.722 --> 02:24:26.224
AGGRESSIVE SALES TACTICS, FALSE

02:24:26.290 --> 02:24:27.358
PROMISES, AND DECEIVING

02:24:27.425 --> 02:24:29.394
CONTRACTS THAT SIGN AWAY

02:24:29.460 --> 02:24:30.328
VETERANS RIGHTS AND FINANCIAL

02:24:30.395 --> 02:24:31.763
STABILITY. THEY'RE OPERATING

02:24:31.829 --> 02:24:33.798
ILLEGAL BUSINESSES UNDER

02:24:33.865 --> 02:24:37.235
FEDERAL LAW AND WITHOUT A NEED,

02:24:37.301 --> 02:24:39.904
WITHOUT NEEDED ENFORCEMENT AND

02:24:39.971 --> 02:24:41.773
CLOSING LOOPHOLES IN THE IN THE

02:24:41.839 --> 02:24:42.740
LAW. PREDATORY CORPORATIONS

02:24:42.807 --> 02:24:44.275
WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE

02:24:44.342 --> 02:24:46.277
OF DISABLED VETERANS MAKING

02:24:46.344 --> 02:24:48.479
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS NATIONALLY

02:24:48.546 --> 02:24:52.850
OFF OF OUR VA DISABILITY SYSTEM.

02:24:52.917 --> 02:24:55.353
THIS IS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE

02:24:55.420 --> 02:24:57.121
FOR ALL OF THE CONGRESSIONALLY

02:24:57.188 --> 02:24:58.423
CHARTERED VETERAN ORGANIZATIONS

02:24:58.489 --> 02:25:01.793
IN CALIFORNIA, INCLUDING THE

02:25:01.859 --> 02:25:03.728
AMERICAN LEGION, VFW, AMVETS,

02:25:03.795 --> 02:25:04.429
DISABLED VETERANS, NATIONAL

02:25:04.495 --> 02:25:08.399
VETS. THE VIETNAM VETERANS OF

02:25:08.466 --> 02:25:09.634
AMERICA. IT'S SUPPORTED BY

02:25:09.700 --> 02:25:12.303
UNIONS LIKE IBEW 1245. AS I

02:25:12.370 --> 02:25:14.038
MENTIONED, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

02:25:14.105 --> 02:25:15.339
IS SUPPORTING THIS. AND WE ALSO

02:25:15.406 --> 02:25:16.607
HEARD FROM OUR CONGRESSIONAL

02:25:16.674 --> 02:25:18.176
LEADER WHO'S BEEN WORKING ON

02:25:18.242 --> 02:25:19.444
THIS NATIONALLY, CONGRESS

02:25:19.510 --> 02:25:22.346
MEMBER MARK TAKANO, WHO WAS THE

02:25:22.413 --> 02:25:23.581
FORMER CHAIR OF VETERANS

02:25:23.648 --> 02:25:25.216
AFFAIRS, WHO IS FIGHTING TO

02:25:25.283 --> 02:25:26.484
STRENGTHEN THESE PROTECTIONS

02:25:26.551 --> 02:25:28.419
FEDERALLY AND NEEDS OUR HELP.

02:25:28.486 --> 02:25:30.354
PERMISSION TO READ, MADAM

02:25:30.421 --> 02:25:33.224
SPEAKER, WITHOUT OBJECTION,

02:25:33.291 --> 02:25:35.226
CONGRESS MEMBER TAKANO REACHED

02:25:35.293 --> 02:25:36.561
OUT THIS MORNING AND SAID,

02:25:36.627 --> 02:25:38.162
QUOTE, CALIFORNIA HAS AN

02:25:38.229 --> 02:25:40.965
OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD THE NATION

02:25:41.032 --> 02:25:42.133
WHERE DC POLITICS HAS LET

02:25:42.200 --> 02:25:46.437
VETERANS DOWN, PASSING SB 604

02:25:46.504 --> 02:25:48.840
WILL ENSURE OUR VETERANS ARE

02:25:48.906 --> 02:25:49.874
PROTECTED FROM UNACCREDITED,

02:25:49.941 --> 02:25:51.075
UNREGULATED ENTITIES THAT SEEK

02:25:51.142 --> 02:25:54.645
TO PROFIT OFF THEIR HARD EARNED

02:25:54.712 --> 02:25:55.480
BENEFITS. AND WITH THAT, I

02:25:55.546 --> 02:25:58.883
RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AND I VOTE.

02:25:58.950 --> 02:25:59.617
THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER.

02:25:59.684 --> 02:26:00.952
ASSEMBLYMEMBER SHARPE COLLINS,

02:26:01.018 --> 02:26:03.654
YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU,

02:26:03.721 --> 02:26:06.357
MADAM SPEAKER. LET ME BE CLEAR.

02:26:06.424 --> 02:26:08.626
I'M A STRONG SUPPORTER OF

02:26:08.693 --> 02:26:11.329
VETERANS 100%. I WOULD LIKE TO

02:26:11.395 --> 02:26:13.998
THANK THOSE OF YOU ON THIS

02:26:14.065 --> 02:26:14.599
FLOOR WHO HAVE SERVED. THANK

02:26:14.665 --> 02:26:17.001
YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SERVICE

02:26:17.068 --> 02:26:17.502
AND THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE

02:26:17.568 --> 02:26:19.504
WATCHING AS WELL. THANK YOU SO

02:26:19.570 --> 02:26:21.372
MUCH FOR YOUR SERVICE. BUT WE

02:26:21.439 --> 02:26:23.107
ALL WANT TO LIVE IN A WORLD

02:26:23.174 --> 02:26:26.344
WHERE VSOS ARE OPERATIONAL AND

02:26:26.410 --> 02:26:29.380
ACCESSIBLE. WE ALSO ALL WANT

02:26:29.447 --> 02:26:32.783
THE VA TO BE TIMELY AND

02:26:32.850 --> 02:26:34.452
EQUITABLE. THAT WORLD, HOWEVER,

02:26:34.519 --> 02:26:36.454
IS NOT THE ONE THAT WE ARE

02:26:36.521 --> 02:26:39.757
FACED WITH RIGHT NOW. THE VA IS

02:26:39.824 --> 02:26:40.358
LITERALLY IMPENDING LITIGATION

02:26:40.424 --> 02:26:42.360
AGAINST BLACK VETERANS WHO ARE

02:26:42.426 --> 02:26:43.861
ALLEGING DECADES OF

02:26:43.928 --> 02:26:45.763
DISCRIMINATION WITH RESPECT TO

02:26:45.830 --> 02:26:48.366
THEIR BENEFITS. WHILE SOME

02:26:48.432 --> 02:26:50.134
COUNTY VSOS ARE OPERATIONAL.

02:26:50.201 --> 02:26:53.504
MANY ARE NOT. INSTEAD, THEY'RE

02:26:53.571 --> 02:26:55.573
SENDING VETERANS TO UNTRAINED

02:26:55.640 --> 02:26:58.009
VOLUNTEERS TO HAVE THEIR CLAIMS

02:26:58.075 --> 02:27:00.211
PROCESSED FURTHER. VSOS ARE

02:27:00.278 --> 02:27:01.879
FACING MAJOR BACKLOGS IN

02:27:01.946 --> 02:27:03.114
CALIFORNIA AND OFTEN ARE

02:27:03.181 --> 02:27:04.382
REQUIRING VETERANS TO WAIT

02:27:04.448 --> 02:27:06.450
YEARS TO RECEIVE THEIR BENEFITS.

02:27:06.517 --> 02:27:07.718
SO ADDITIONALLY, BLACK VETERANS

02:27:07.785 --> 02:27:10.688
HAVE THE HIGHEST DENIAL RATES,

02:27:10.755 --> 02:27:11.622
MEANING EVEN AFTER YEARS OF

02:27:11.689 --> 02:27:13.291
WAITING DUE TO THE BACKLOG,

02:27:13.357 --> 02:27:15.092
THEY ARE STILL NOT RECEIVING

02:27:15.159 --> 02:27:16.961
THE BENEFITS. SO WHAT? WHAT DO

02:27:17.028 --> 02:27:20.431
WE DO? LET ME BE CLEAR. I DO

02:27:20.498 --> 02:27:22.667
NOT LIKE THE IDEA OF COMPANIES

02:27:22.733 --> 02:27:23.868
CHARGING FEES FOR ANYTHING

02:27:23.935 --> 02:27:26.103
THAT'S OTHERWISE FREE SERVICES.

02:27:26.170 --> 02:27:29.674
I DO NOT LIKE THE IDEA, BUT I

02:27:29.740 --> 02:27:31.542
SIMPLY CANNOT STAND IDLY BY

02:27:31.609 --> 02:27:33.444
WHILE BLACK VETERANS IN MY

02:27:33.511 --> 02:27:34.679
DISTRICT TELL ME THAT THIS IS

02:27:34.745 --> 02:27:36.280
THEIR ONLY OPTION. THIS IS

02:27:36.347 --> 02:27:37.448
SOMETHING THAT WORKS FOR THEM

02:27:37.515 --> 02:27:39.350
RATHER THAN THEM. CONTINUE TO

02:27:39.417 --> 02:27:40.518
HAVE THE UNEQUAL AND UNFAIR

02:27:40.585 --> 02:27:41.519
TREATMENT BY THEIR COUNTY

02:27:41.586 --> 02:27:45.223
SERVICES. IN AN IDEAL WORLD,

02:27:45.289 --> 02:27:47.391
COUNTY SERVICES ARE FULLY

02:27:47.458 --> 02:27:48.359
FUNDED AND THERE IS NO NEED FOR

02:27:48.426 --> 02:27:50.394
THESE COMPANIES AT ALL. BUT IT

02:27:50.461 --> 02:27:53.197
IS NOT OUR BUDGET. REALITY IN

02:27:53.264 --> 02:27:54.832
CALIFORNIA CANNOT FIX THE

02:27:54.899 --> 02:27:56.567
FEDERAL VA, SO THE NEXT OPTION

02:27:56.634 --> 02:27:58.469
IS TO REGULATE THESE COMPANIES.

02:27:58.536 --> 02:28:00.504
AND THERE ARE AMENDMENTS THAT

02:28:00.571 --> 02:28:01.806
WERE THAT WOULD ACTUALLY ALLOW

02:28:01.872 --> 02:28:04.108
THIS BILL TO DO SO. BUT THOSE

02:28:04.175 --> 02:28:05.209
AMENDMENTS WERE ACTUALLY

02:28:05.276 --> 02:28:07.278
REJECTED. SO ONCE AGAIN, ON

02:28:07.345 --> 02:28:09.347
THAT NOTE, LET ME BE CLEAR. MY

02:28:09.413 --> 02:28:11.215
VOTE TODAY IS NOT IN SUPPORT OF

02:28:11.282 --> 02:28:12.850
THESE COMPANIES AT ALL BECAUSE

02:28:12.917 --> 02:28:14.952
AS I STATED, I'M NOT OKAY WITH

02:28:15.019 --> 02:28:16.187
THESE FEES BEING CHARGED. WHAT

02:28:16.254 --> 02:28:19.523
I AM DOING IS PUTTING THE IDEA

02:28:19.590 --> 02:28:22.360
OF CHOICE FIRST. VETERANS

02:28:22.426 --> 02:28:24.295
SHOULD HAVE A CHOICE. I CANNOT

02:28:24.362 --> 02:28:26.364
CONDEMN BLACK VETERANS TO THE

02:28:26.430 --> 02:28:27.798
SEPARATE BUT EQUAL TREATMENT

02:28:27.865 --> 02:28:29.300
FROM THE VA SYSTEM. THIS IS A

02:28:29.367 --> 02:28:31.335
SYSTEM THAT NEEDS TO BE

02:28:31.402 --> 02:28:33.437
CORRECTED. WE ALWAYS WANT TO

02:28:33.504 --> 02:28:34.272
TALK ABOUT EQUITY. WHAT IS TRUE

02:28:34.338 --> 02:28:36.307
EQUITY? TRUE EQUITY IS

02:28:36.374 --> 02:28:38.109
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT ONE SIZE

02:28:38.175 --> 02:28:39.277
FITS ALL APPROACHES DO NOT WORK.

02:28:39.343 --> 02:28:42.113
AND WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE A

02:28:42.179 --> 02:28:44.282
COLLECTION OF BAD OPTIONS RIGHT

02:28:44.348 --> 02:28:46.417
NOW. BUT THIS BILL ONCE AGAIN

02:28:46.484 --> 02:28:48.519
SHOEHORNS BLACK PEOPLE INTO A

02:28:48.586 --> 02:28:49.320
SYSTEM THAT CONTINUOUSLY IS

02:28:49.387 --> 02:28:52.223
FAILING THEM. HISTORY IS

02:28:52.290 --> 02:28:53.357
LITTERED WITH EXAMPLES OF THIS,

02:28:53.424 --> 02:28:54.625
AND THIS BILL OFFERS

02:28:54.692 --> 02:28:55.660
OPPORTUNITIES TO CONTINUE THIS

02:28:55.726 --> 02:28:57.495
FLAWED WAY OF THINKING. SO WE

02:28:57.561 --> 02:28:59.463
NEED TO SLOW DOWN A LITTLE BIT

02:28:59.530 --> 02:29:00.698
HERE, BRING TOGETHER

02:29:00.765 --> 02:29:02.700
STAKEHOLDERS, AND WORK ON

02:29:02.767 --> 02:29:03.567
SOLUTIONS THAT WORK ACROSS ALL

02:29:03.634 --> 02:29:06.304
OF OUR COUNTIES. YOU ALL KNOW

02:29:06.370 --> 02:29:08.506
I'M FROM I'M IN SAN DIEGO, SO

02:29:08.572 --> 02:29:10.241
IT SHOULD NOT BE THE CASE THAT

02:29:10.308 --> 02:29:12.376
VETERANS IN SONOMA COUNTY HAVE

02:29:12.443 --> 02:29:13.511
BETTER OUTCOMES WITH FREE

02:29:13.577 --> 02:29:15.513
SERVICES THAN VETERANS. IN SAN

02:29:15.579 --> 02:29:18.049
DIEGO COUNTY, WHICH IS OUR

02:29:18.115 --> 02:29:19.150
LARGEST MILITARY OUTPOST. SO

02:29:19.216 --> 02:29:20.418
PEOPLE PROBABLY WANT TO KNOW,

02:29:20.484 --> 02:29:22.286
WELL, WHY IS SHE SO INTO THIS?

02:29:22.353 --> 02:29:24.755
I AM A FORMER SPOUSE OF A

02:29:24.822 --> 02:29:26.457
VETERAN. I HAVE MY FAMILY

02:29:26.524 --> 02:29:27.291
MEMBERS. THERE ARE OTHER

02:29:27.358 --> 02:29:28.526
PERSONAL CONNECTIONS IF YOU

02:29:28.592 --> 02:29:30.261
WANT TO TALK ABOUT THINGS

02:29:30.328 --> 02:29:32.163
GETTING PERSONAL. BUT WHEN WE

02:29:32.229 --> 02:29:34.298
TALK ALL THE TIME ON THIS FLOOR

02:29:34.365 --> 02:29:35.599
ABOUT TRYING TO GET THE POLICY

02:29:35.666 --> 02:29:37.268
RIGHT, THEN LET'S DO THAT AND

02:29:37.335 --> 02:29:39.270
TRY TO GET THE POLICY RIGHT.

02:29:39.337 --> 02:29:40.571
THAT IS NOT HAPPENING HERE, AND

02:29:40.638 --> 02:29:42.239
THERE IS NO NEED TO RUSH THIS

02:29:42.306 --> 02:29:43.507
PROCESS. LET'S CONTINUE

02:29:43.574 --> 02:29:45.876
DISCUSSION AND FIND A WAY TO

02:29:45.943 --> 02:29:47.244
GET TO A FULL COUNTY FUNDING

02:29:47.311 --> 02:29:49.680
WITHOUT CLOSING OFF AVENUES FOR

02:29:49.747 --> 02:29:52.316
SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE AND

02:29:52.383 --> 02:29:53.484
MARGINALIZED VETERANS. LET'S

02:29:53.551 --> 02:29:55.519
RECOGNIZE THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF

02:29:55.586 --> 02:29:56.620
BLACK AND BROWN VETERANS, AND

02:29:56.687 --> 02:29:57.621
GIVE THESE HEROES THE CHOICE

02:29:57.688 --> 02:29:58.756
THAT THEY HAVE RIGHTFULLY

02:29:58.823 --> 02:30:00.191
EARNED WHEN THEY PUT THEIR

02:30:00.257 --> 02:30:02.993
LIVES ON THE LINE TO SERVE THIS

02:30:03.060 --> 02:30:03.761
COUNTRY, THEY SHOULD HAVE A

02:30:03.828 --> 02:30:10.568
RIGHT TO CHOOSE. THANK YOU,

02:30:10.634 --> 02:30:12.336
ASSEMBLY MEMBER ASSEMBLYMEMBER

02:30:12.403 --> 02:30:14.905
DEMAIO, YOU'RE RECOGNIZED.

02:30:14.972 --> 02:30:17.174
THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THE

02:30:17.241 --> 02:30:19.643
INTENT BEHIND THIS BILL. THE

02:30:19.710 --> 02:30:23.614
AUTHOR IS RAISING A FRUSTRATING

02:30:23.681 --> 02:30:24.849
ISSUE OF THESE PREDATORY FOR

02:30:24.915 --> 02:30:28.285
PROFIT COMPANIES THAT ARE

02:30:28.352 --> 02:30:30.221
BILKING OUR VETERANS FOR ACCESS

02:30:30.287 --> 02:30:32.356
TO GOVERNMENT BENEFITS,

02:30:32.423 --> 02:30:35.393
BENEFITS THAT THEY'VE EARNED.

02:30:35.459 --> 02:30:36.127
WHAT'S SO FRUSTRATING ABOUT

02:30:36.193 --> 02:30:38.996
THIS IS THAT THE FRAUD, THE

02:30:39.063 --> 02:30:40.498
SHAKEDOWN, THE THE PRICE

02:30:40.564 --> 02:30:43.734
GOUGING IS MADE POSSIBLE

02:30:43.801 --> 02:30:45.269
BECAUSE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T DO

02:30:45.336 --> 02:30:49.807
ITS JOB, BECAUSE THE VA HASN'T

02:30:49.874 --> 02:30:52.410
PROVIDED ACCESS TO THESE

02:30:52.476 --> 02:30:54.845
BENEFITS. AND SO VETERANS ARE

02:30:54.912 --> 02:30:56.480
DESPERATE, AND THAT PUTS THEM

02:30:56.547 --> 02:30:59.450
IN A POSITION, A VULNERABLE

02:30:59.517 --> 02:31:02.720
POSITION, TO BE PREYED ON BY

02:31:02.787 --> 02:31:05.389
THESE FOR PROFIT OPERATORS. I

02:31:05.456 --> 02:31:06.557
UNDERSTAND THAT THE SENATOR IS

02:31:06.624 --> 02:31:08.826
TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS BY

02:31:08.893 --> 02:31:11.429
BANNING THESE UNLICENSED

02:31:11.495 --> 02:31:13.431
OPERATORS. SO BASICALLY

02:31:13.497 --> 02:31:16.367
THROWING THE GOOD OUT WITH THE

02:31:16.434 --> 02:31:19.336
BAD, I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT.

02:31:19.403 --> 02:31:20.738
I'M ALSO CONCERNED THAT THE

02:31:20.805 --> 02:31:23.674
AUTHOR HAS NOT BEEN RECEPTIVE

02:31:23.741 --> 02:31:25.376
TO SOME COMMON SENSE AMENDMENTS

02:31:25.443 --> 02:31:28.712
TO REFORM THE SYSTEM, TO

02:31:28.779 --> 02:31:29.713
PROVIDE GREATER SAFEGUARDS AND

02:31:29.780 --> 02:31:34.151
OVERSIGHT. THE BILL EXEMPTS A

02:31:34.218 --> 02:31:36.420
POWERFUL SPECIAL INTEREST GROUP,

02:31:36.487 --> 02:31:39.623
THE TRIAL ATTORNEYS. LAWYERS

02:31:39.690 --> 02:31:42.793
ARE EXEMPT FROM EVERY SINGLE

02:31:42.860 --> 02:31:44.462
ONE OF THE PROVISIONS IN THIS

02:31:44.528 --> 02:31:46.464
BILL, SO THE LAWYERS CAN SIT

02:31:46.530 --> 02:31:50.267
THERE AND RACK UP HOURLY RATES

02:31:50.334 --> 02:31:53.204
AND TURN AROUND AND GET

02:31:53.270 --> 02:31:55.639
COMPENSATED. AND I CAN TELL YOU

02:31:55.706 --> 02:31:58.843
RIGHT NOW, I'M NOT SO SURE I

02:31:58.909 --> 02:32:00.077
WOULD TRUST LAWYERS TO BE THE

02:32:00.144 --> 02:32:04.682
BEST ADVOCATES FOR OUR VETERANS.

02:32:04.748 --> 02:32:06.817
BUT IT BRINGS ME BACK TO THE

02:32:06.884 --> 02:32:09.553
ISSUE HERE. IT'S OUTRAGEOUS

02:32:09.620 --> 02:32:10.287
THAT GOVERNMENT HAS FAILED

02:32:10.354 --> 02:32:12.423
THESE VETERANS BY NOT PROVIDING

02:32:12.490 --> 02:32:13.991
THEM WITH ACCESS TO THE

02:32:14.058 --> 02:32:15.192
BENEFITS THAT THEY RIGHTFULLY

02:32:15.259 --> 02:32:18.596
EARNED IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY, OUR

02:32:18.662 --> 02:32:20.397
COUNTY SUPERVISORS FELL ALL

02:32:20.464 --> 02:32:22.800
OVER THEMSELVES TO PUT $6

02:32:22.867 --> 02:32:26.303
MILLION EVERY 90 DAYS ON THE

02:32:26.370 --> 02:32:29.340
TABLE LAST YEAR, FOR A TOTAL OF

02:32:29.406 --> 02:32:31.442
OVER $20 MILLION TO HELP

02:32:31.509 --> 02:32:34.745
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS GET FREE,

02:32:34.812 --> 02:32:38.249
TAXPAYER FUNDED NAVIGATORS TO

02:32:38.315 --> 02:32:39.950
WORK THE SYSTEM SO THAT THEY

02:32:40.017 --> 02:32:42.953
COULD ENROLL IN TAXPAYER FUNDED

02:32:43.020 --> 02:32:44.421
WELFARE PROGRAMS. NOW, I BRING

02:32:44.488 --> 02:32:46.190
THAT UP BECAUSE MANY OF YOU

02:32:46.257 --> 02:32:49.059
SUPPORT SIMILAR PROGRAMS. HOW

02:32:49.126 --> 02:32:51.262
ABOUT WE TAKE AND DEFUND ALL OF

02:32:51.328 --> 02:32:54.398
THOSE PROGRAMS FOR NONCITIZENS,

02:32:54.465 --> 02:32:56.200
AND INSTEAD MAKE SURE THAT IN

02:32:56.267 --> 02:32:59.103
CALIFORNIA WE WILL HIRE IF THE

02:32:59.169 --> 02:33:02.306
VA CAN'T DO THE JOB PROPERLY IN

02:33:02.373 --> 02:33:04.508
CALIFORNIA, WE WILL HIRE

02:33:04.575 --> 02:33:07.378
NAVIGATORS AT STATE GOVERNMENT

02:33:07.444 --> 02:33:09.179
EXPENSE TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE

02:33:09.246 --> 02:33:11.549
VETERANS CAN GET THE BENEFIT

02:33:11.615 --> 02:33:14.285
THAT THEY HAVE EARNED. WHAT CAT

02:33:14.351 --> 02:33:16.754
GOT YOUR TONGUE CAN'T DO THAT

02:33:16.820 --> 02:33:19.189
FOR VETERANS, BUT WE WILL DO

02:33:19.256 --> 02:33:21.492
THAT FOR NONCITIZENS. AGAIN,

02:33:21.559 --> 02:33:23.227
YOU WANT TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

02:33:23.294 --> 02:33:24.395
IT'S NOT JUST SAYING, OKAY,

02:33:24.461 --> 02:33:25.563
LET'S BAN THESE PREDATORS. I

02:33:25.629 --> 02:33:27.298
MEAN, YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THESE

02:33:27.364 --> 02:33:29.133
COMPANIES, IT'S OUTRAGEOUS WHAT

02:33:29.199 --> 02:33:30.501
THEY CHARGE. AND WHAT THEY DO

02:33:30.568 --> 02:33:32.336
IS THEY PAY MONEY TO GET AT THE

02:33:32.403 --> 02:33:33.604
TOP OF THE SEARCH ENGINE. SO

02:33:33.671 --> 02:33:35.372
WHEN THESE POOR VETS ARE

02:33:35.439 --> 02:33:37.408
SEARCHING FOR HELP ONLINE, THE

02:33:37.474 --> 02:33:40.945
FREE SERVICES ARE PUT ON PAGE

02:33:41.011 --> 02:33:42.846
FIVE, 6 OR 7 AND THE PREDATORY

02:33:42.913 --> 02:33:44.214
SERVICES ARE AT THE TOP. AND WE

02:33:44.281 --> 02:33:46.317
KNOW THAT THEY'VE HIRED

02:33:46.383 --> 02:33:48.452
LOBBYISTS HERE IN SACRAMENTO.

02:33:48.519 --> 02:33:50.321
THEY'VE GOT MONEY TO TRY TO

02:33:50.387 --> 02:33:53.090
OPPOSE COMMON SENSE REFORMS. SO

02:33:53.157 --> 02:33:55.492
MY COLLEAGUES, I THINK MANY OF

02:33:55.559 --> 02:33:58.195
YOU WANT TO HELP OUR VETERANS.

02:33:58.262 --> 02:33:59.363
THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US

02:33:59.430 --> 02:34:01.165
TO DO THAT. WE'VE ALREADY SHOWN

02:34:01.231 --> 02:34:03.534
THAT WE'RE WILLING TO THROW A

02:34:03.601 --> 02:34:04.268
BUNCH OF TAXPAYER MONEY AT

02:34:04.335 --> 02:34:07.471
HIRING STATE NAVIGATORS FOR

02:34:07.538 --> 02:34:08.739
UNDOCUMENTED, ILLEGAL

02:34:08.806 --> 02:34:10.140
IMMIGRANTS. HOW ABOUT WE

02:34:10.207 --> 02:34:11.875
INSTEAD HIRE STATE NAVIGATORS

02:34:11.942 --> 02:34:13.811
FOR THE VETERANS IF WE'RE GOING

02:34:13.877 --> 02:34:15.512
TO PASS THIS BILL? AND I DO

02:34:15.579 --> 02:34:18.282
BELIEVE THAT PENDING INPUT FROM

02:34:18.349 --> 02:34:19.617
OTHER MEMBERS, BECAUSE I AM

02:34:19.683 --> 02:34:21.352
KIND OF ON THE FENCE AS TO DO

02:34:21.418 --> 02:34:23.454
YOU THROW OUT ALL OF THE

02:34:23.520 --> 02:34:24.154
ORGANIZATIONS IF IF THE

02:34:24.221 --> 02:34:25.889
GOVERNMENT IS ACTUALLY NOT

02:34:25.956 --> 02:34:27.458
PROVIDING ACCESS TO BENEFITS. I

02:34:27.524 --> 02:34:29.226
UNDERSTAND SOME OF YOU ARE TORN.

02:34:29.293 --> 02:34:31.729
THERE IS A GOOD ARGUMENT ON

02:34:31.795 --> 02:34:34.098
BOTH SIDES. THE BILL IS FLAWED,

02:34:34.164 --> 02:34:37.768
BUT PERHAPS IT WILL FORCE TO

02:34:37.835 --> 02:34:39.203
THE SURFACE THE PROBLEM THAT

02:34:39.269 --> 02:34:42.473
WE'RE HAVING WITH VETERANS, THE

02:34:42.539 --> 02:34:48.212
BENEFITS THAT THEY DESERVE.

02:34:48.278 --> 02:34:49.279
ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK-SILVA

02:34:49.346 --> 02:34:53.217
YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU,

02:34:53.283 --> 02:34:55.119
MADAM SPEAKER. AND MEMBERS, I

02:34:55.185 --> 02:34:58.355
RISE TO SUPPORT SB 694, WHICH

02:34:58.422 --> 02:35:01.125
WILL HELP SUPPORT VETERANS

02:35:01.191 --> 02:35:04.395
BENEFITS IN OUR STATE. AND I

02:35:04.461 --> 02:35:06.230
ACTUALLY AGREE WITH MY

02:35:06.296 --> 02:35:07.498
COLLEAGUES THAT HAVE SPOKEN

02:35:07.564 --> 02:35:10.234
BEFORE ME WHO HAVE STATED SOME

02:35:10.300 --> 02:35:12.503
OPPOSITION. ONE OF THE THINGS

02:35:12.569 --> 02:35:14.238
THAT I'VE LEARNED NOW IN MY

02:35:14.304 --> 02:35:16.507
11TH YEAR AS A STATE ASSEMBLY

02:35:16.573 --> 02:35:19.309
MEMBER IS LEGISLATION IS

02:35:19.376 --> 02:35:21.478
IMPERFECT, EVEN AS ITS BEST, AT

02:35:21.545 --> 02:35:24.248
ITS BEST. AND OFTEN WE TAKE A

02:35:24.314 --> 02:35:26.316
PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT GETS

02:35:26.383 --> 02:35:28.419
PASSED AND WE NEED TO COME BACK.

02:35:28.485 --> 02:35:31.355
AND WHAT I CALL PUT SLIVERS OF

02:35:31.422 --> 02:35:34.258
LEGISLATION IN BECAUSE IT'S NOT

02:35:34.324 --> 02:35:36.293
PERFECT. AND AS THE MEMBER FROM

02:35:36.360 --> 02:35:39.396
SAN DIEGO STATED, IF THIS

02:35:39.463 --> 02:35:41.498
BRINGS PEOPLE TO THE TABLE, WE

02:35:41.565 --> 02:35:43.267
NEED THAT. WE KNOW THAT OUR

02:35:43.333 --> 02:35:46.136
COUNTY SERVICE VETERAN OFFICERS

02:35:46.203 --> 02:35:49.473
ARE AVAILABLE, BUT WE ALSO KNOW

02:35:49.540 --> 02:35:52.242
THAT THEY'RE NOT EASY, EASILY

02:35:52.309 --> 02:35:53.877
ACCESSIBLE, THAT VETERANS NEED

02:35:53.944 --> 02:35:56.747
MORE. I SERVED AS THE VETERAN'S

02:35:56.814 --> 02:36:00.117
CHAIR IN 2013, AND SOME OF

02:36:00.184 --> 02:36:01.752
THESE ISSUES WERE BROUGHT

02:36:01.819 --> 02:36:04.121
FORWARD ALMOST A DECADE AGO.

02:36:04.188 --> 02:36:05.422
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MEMBERS

02:36:05.489 --> 02:36:07.458
DON'T KNOW IS THAT WHEN

02:36:07.524 --> 02:36:10.894
VETERANS LEAVE SERVICE, THEY

02:36:10.961 --> 02:36:14.431
HAVE 26 STEPS TO GO THROUGH IN

02:36:14.498 --> 02:36:17.801
ORDER TO OBTAIN THEIR VETERANS

02:36:17.868 --> 02:36:19.403
BENEFITS. MANY OF US WOULD DROP

02:36:19.470 --> 02:36:21.939
OFF OURSELVES TO GET THESE

02:36:22.005 --> 02:36:24.341
BENEFITS AT ABOUT THE 10TH STEP.

02:36:24.408 --> 02:36:27.211
IT'S WHY WE SEE VETERANS, NOT

02:36:27.277 --> 02:36:29.947
NUMBER ONE, ACCESSING THEIR

02:36:30.013 --> 02:36:31.248
VETERANS THEIR BENEFITS BECAUSE

02:36:31.315 --> 02:36:33.517
IT'S SUCH A LENGTHY PROCESS. WE

02:36:33.584 --> 02:36:36.553
ALSO KNOW THAT GO THROUGH

02:36:36.620 --> 02:36:38.455
ORIENTATIONS TO LEAVE SERVICE,

02:36:38.522 --> 02:36:40.290
BUT SOMETIMES THOSE

02:36:40.357 --> 02:36:41.759
ORIENTATIONS ARE IN OTHER

02:36:41.825 --> 02:36:44.161
STATES. AND THEN THEY COME TO,

02:36:44.228 --> 02:36:46.530
IN OUR CASE, CALIFORNIA, AND

02:36:46.597 --> 02:36:47.498
THEY'RE STILL TRYING TO

02:36:47.564 --> 02:36:49.666
NAVIGATE. SO THE WORD NAVIGATOR

02:36:49.733 --> 02:36:52.336
IS A GREAT WORD. AND THAT'S

02:36:52.402 --> 02:36:54.471
WHAT OUR COUNTY VETERANS

02:36:54.538 --> 02:36:56.373
SERVICE OFFICERS ARE FOR. BUT

02:36:56.440 --> 02:36:58.075
SOMETIMES THEY'RE NOT FINDING

02:36:58.142 --> 02:37:01.078
THEM OR THEY'RE NOT ACCESSING

02:37:01.145 --> 02:37:03.814
THEM. I LIKE TO THINK OF THIS

02:37:03.881 --> 02:37:05.249
LEGISLATION AS A STUDENT WHO

02:37:05.315 --> 02:37:08.919
GETS A SCHOLARSHIP, AND THEY

02:37:08.986 --> 02:37:10.387
GET A $10,000 SCHOLARSHIP, AND

02:37:10.454 --> 02:37:12.289
SOMEBODY COMES IN AND SAYS, HEY,

02:37:12.356 --> 02:37:14.558
I WILL HELP YOU NAVIGATE THIS

02:37:14.625 --> 02:37:16.460
SCHOLARSHIP, BUT I'M GOING TO

02:37:16.527 --> 02:37:19.196
TAKE 20% OF THAT SCHOLARSHIP.

02:37:19.263 --> 02:37:21.532
AND SOMEBODY WHO'S DESPERATE

02:37:21.598 --> 02:37:22.533
MIGHT SAY, SURE, THAT'S WORTH

02:37:22.599 --> 02:37:24.668
IT TO ME, BUT THEY'RE LITERALLY

02:37:24.735 --> 02:37:26.770
TAKING DOLLARS OUT OF VETERANS

02:37:26.837 --> 02:37:29.206
POCKETS. AND ALTHOUGH I KNOW

02:37:29.273 --> 02:37:31.875
THIS HAS BEEN CONTENTIOUS, I

02:37:31.942 --> 02:37:35.879
KNOW IN COMMITTEE IT WAS A VERY

02:37:35.946 --> 02:37:37.381
DIFFICULT COMMITTEE HEARING.

02:37:37.447 --> 02:37:40.217
WHEN WE'RE HERE ON THE FLOOR,

02:37:40.284 --> 02:37:43.387
THIS IS MESSY. SOMETIMES

02:37:43.453 --> 02:37:45.255
THERE'S SCENARIOS THAT DEVELOP

02:37:45.322 --> 02:37:47.257
THAT MAKE PEOPLE VERY ANGRY.

02:37:47.324 --> 02:37:50.861
AND THIS IS ONE OF OUR, I WOULD

02:37:50.928 --> 02:37:53.363
SAY, LESS FIGHTS ON THE FLOOR,

02:37:53.430 --> 02:37:55.499
BUT THERE'S GOING TO BE MANY

02:37:55.566 --> 02:37:56.300
MORE ON THE FLOOR. WE'VE

02:37:56.366 --> 02:37:58.769
ALREADY HAD SOME THIS YEAR, BUT

02:37:58.836 --> 02:38:01.171
THIS BILL IS ABOUT VETERANS AND

02:38:01.238 --> 02:38:03.841
THE SIMPLEST WAY TO TALK ABOUT

02:38:03.907 --> 02:38:07.244
IT, IT'S ABOUT. ORGANIZATIONS

02:38:07.311 --> 02:38:10.147
TAKING MONEY FROM VETERANS. CAN

02:38:10.214 --> 02:38:12.749
WE DO A BETTER JOB WITH OUR

02:38:12.816 --> 02:38:13.550
COUNTY SERVICE VETERANS

02:38:13.617 --> 02:38:16.253
OFFICERS? YES. AND WE NEED TO

02:38:16.320 --> 02:38:18.422
PUSH OUR COUNTIES AND THOSE

02:38:18.488 --> 02:38:19.323
THAT INTERFACE WITH VETERANS

02:38:19.389 --> 02:38:21.825
GROUPS TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE OUT

02:38:21.892 --> 02:38:23.093
OF THEIR OFFICES AND THEY'RE

02:38:23.160 --> 02:38:25.195
ACCESSING OR THEY'RE AVAILABLE

02:38:25.262 --> 02:38:27.397
TO VETERANS. THERE'S A LOT WE

02:38:27.464 --> 02:38:29.199
NEED TO DO, BUT THIS IS A STEP

02:38:29.266 --> 02:38:30.367
FORWARD. AND WITH THAT,

02:38:30.434 --> 02:38:32.169
VETERANS ARE ASKING US TO STAND

02:38:32.236 --> 02:38:35.973
WITH THEM. AND I ASK YOU TO

02:38:36.039 --> 02:38:40.377
SUPPORT SB 694. THANK YOU.

02:38:40.444 --> 02:38:41.745
ASSEMBLYMEMBER. ASSEMBLYMEMBER

02:38:41.812 --> 02:38:44.681
WILSON, YOU'RE RECOGNIZED.

02:38:44.748 --> 02:38:47.217
THANK YOU, MADAM SPEAKER. I

02:38:47.284 --> 02:38:49.853
RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB 694.

02:38:49.920 --> 02:38:51.355
FIRST, I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT

02:38:51.421 --> 02:38:54.391
I SUPPORT THE COMMENTS FROM MY

02:38:54.458 --> 02:38:56.326
COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO, WHO

02:38:56.393 --> 02:38:59.062
IS A COLLEAGUE ON THE BLACK

02:38:59.129 --> 02:39:00.230
CAUCUS, AND SUPPORT HER

02:39:00.297 --> 02:39:02.366
COMMENTS, ESPECIALLY AROUND THE

02:39:02.432 --> 02:39:04.668
FACT THAT WE SEE THAT BLACK AND

02:39:04.735 --> 02:39:06.336
BROWN PEOPLE ARE LESS LIKELY TO

02:39:06.403 --> 02:39:09.439
HAVE A POSITIVE OUTCOME WHEN

02:39:09.506 --> 02:39:11.608
NAVIGATING THE CLAIMS PROCESS.

02:39:11.675 --> 02:39:14.611
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE. AND AT

02:39:14.678 --> 02:39:15.545
THE SAME TIME, IT'S TRUE THAT

02:39:15.612 --> 02:39:18.882
BLACK AND BROWN FOLKS ARE

02:39:18.949 --> 02:39:22.886
USUALLY THE MOST LIKELY TO BE

02:39:22.953 --> 02:39:25.856
TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THROUGH THIS

02:39:25.923 --> 02:39:27.224
PREDATORY PROCESS. BUT I RISE

02:39:27.291 --> 02:39:29.293
TODAY, AND I WASN'T PLANNING ON

02:39:29.359 --> 02:39:31.461
SPEAKING. I RISE TODAY BECAUSE

02:39:31.528 --> 02:39:33.730
I WANTED TO TALK A BIT ABOUT

02:39:33.797 --> 02:39:36.433
THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUE,

02:39:36.500 --> 02:39:38.302
THE OTHER COLLEAGUE FROM SAN

02:39:38.368 --> 02:39:40.470
DIEGO, AND MAKE SURE THAT THIS

02:39:40.537 --> 02:39:41.238
BODY UNDERSTANDS WHAT THE

02:39:41.305 --> 02:39:43.240
PROCESS IS LIKE. I HAVE

02:39:43.307 --> 02:39:44.374
EXPERIENCED THIS PROCESS

02:39:44.441 --> 02:39:46.310
THROUGH MY HUSBAND, WHO IS A

02:39:46.376 --> 02:39:48.912
BLACK VETERAN WHO RECEIVES

02:39:48.979 --> 02:39:51.214
DISABILITY, AND MY SON, WHO IS

02:39:51.281 --> 02:39:52.416
ALSO A BLACK VETERAN WHO

02:39:52.482 --> 02:39:53.483
RECEIVES DISABILITY, AND HOW

02:39:53.550 --> 02:39:55.252
THEY NAVIGATED THE SYSTEM IN

02:39:55.319 --> 02:39:57.321
SOLANO COUNTY, WHICH, AS MY

02:39:57.387 --> 02:39:58.588
OTHER COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO

02:39:58.655 --> 02:39:59.356
NOTED, IS ONE OF THE BETTER

02:39:59.423 --> 02:40:01.525
PLACES TO RECEIVE SERVICES. BUT

02:40:01.591 --> 02:40:03.160
THERE ARE MULTIPLE WAYS FOR

02:40:03.226 --> 02:40:06.330
SOMEONE TO BE ABLE TO FILE A

02:40:06.396 --> 02:40:08.165
CLAIM AND DO THE APPEAL PROCESS,

02:40:08.231 --> 02:40:10.267
WHICH IS COMPLETELY FREE. ONE

02:40:10.334 --> 02:40:11.635
OF THOSE WAYS IS THROUGH THE

02:40:11.702 --> 02:40:13.270
COUNTY VSO, WHICH WE'RE TALKING

02:40:13.337 --> 02:40:15.339
ABOUT TODAY. ANOTHER WAY IS

02:40:15.405 --> 02:40:17.474
THROUGH THE VA ACCREDITED

02:40:17.541 --> 02:40:18.709
PROGRAM, WHERE THOSE

02:40:18.775 --> 02:40:21.511
ORGANIZATIONS RECEIVE TRAINING

02:40:21.578 --> 02:40:24.414
FROM THE VA TO BE ABLE TO BE A

02:40:24.481 --> 02:40:25.949
PART OF THIS PROCESS AND ACCESS

02:40:26.016 --> 02:40:27.351
THIS PROCESS. EXCUSE ME, ACCESS

02:40:27.417 --> 02:40:29.386
THIS PROCESS. AND THE OTHER WAY

02:40:29.453 --> 02:40:30.220
IS THROUGH AN ATTORNEY. SO

02:40:30.287 --> 02:40:31.488
SOMEONE CAN USE THEIR OWN

02:40:31.555 --> 02:40:33.523
ATTORNEY TO DO THIS. AND THAT'S

02:40:33.590 --> 02:40:35.158
WHY I THINK IT'S VITAL THAT WE

02:40:35.225 --> 02:40:36.426
IN CALIFORNIA DON'T TAKE AWAY

02:40:36.493 --> 02:40:38.161
AN OPTION THAT THE FEDERAL

02:40:38.228 --> 02:40:39.296
GOVERNMENT ALLOWS AN ATTORNEY

02:40:39.363 --> 02:40:41.365
TO PROCESS THIS FOR THEM, THAT

02:40:41.431 --> 02:40:43.100
WE DON'T TAKE THAT AWAY FROM

02:40:43.166 --> 02:40:44.234
VETERANS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO

02:40:44.301 --> 02:40:46.703
I WANTED TO MAKE THAT

02:40:46.770 --> 02:40:47.971
COMPLETELY CLEAR. AND I ALSO

02:40:48.038 --> 02:40:49.473
WANT US TO KNOW THAT THERE ARE

02:40:49.539 --> 02:40:52.109
THINGS THAT WE CAN DO BEYOND

02:40:52.175 --> 02:40:54.644
THIS, TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT OUR

02:40:54.711 --> 02:40:55.512
VETERANS HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

02:40:55.579 --> 02:40:57.114
ONE OF THOSE IS WE ALREADY GIVE

02:40:57.180 --> 02:40:59.249
AN ALLOCATION TO THE COUNTIES

02:40:59.316 --> 02:41:01.251
TO HELP FUND THE VSO PROGRAM.

02:41:01.318 --> 02:41:03.286
WE SHOULD INCREASE THAT

02:41:03.353 --> 02:41:05.789
ALLOCATION AS A STATE. SECONDLY,

02:41:05.856 --> 02:41:07.257
WE CAN ENCOURAGE ADDITIONAL

02:41:07.324 --> 02:41:09.359
PARTICIPATION OF ORGANIZATIONS

02:41:09.426 --> 02:41:10.560
ACROSS OUR STATE TO GET

02:41:10.627 --> 02:41:13.630
ACCREDITED BY THE VA SO WE CAN

02:41:13.697 --> 02:41:14.464
INCREASE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

02:41:14.531 --> 02:41:16.333
VETERANS TO BE ABLE TO GET THE

02:41:16.400 --> 02:41:18.335
BENEFITS THAT THEY RIGHTLY

02:41:18.402 --> 02:41:19.336
DESERVE AND HAVE ABSOLUTELY

02:41:19.403 --> 02:41:21.204
EARNED, ESPECIALLY IN HIGH

02:41:21.271 --> 02:41:23.373
VETERAN AREAS LIKE THE COUNTY

02:41:23.440 --> 02:41:25.308
OF SAN DIEGO. AND LAST BUT NOT

02:41:25.375 --> 02:41:27.477
LEAST, I WOULD LIKE TO JUST SAY

02:41:27.544 --> 02:41:29.513
ONE THING ABOUT THE PREDATORY

02:41:29.579 --> 02:41:32.082
PRACTICES. THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN

02:41:32.149 --> 02:41:34.284
A PROBLEM, BUT A FORMER

02:41:34.351 --> 02:41:36.520
PRESIDENT BIDEN SIGNED THE PACT

02:41:36.586 --> 02:41:39.890
ACT, WHICH INCREASED BENEFITS,

02:41:39.956 --> 02:41:40.357
INCREASED ELIGIBILITY

02:41:40.424 --> 02:41:41.591
ELIGIBILITY. IT INCREASED THE

02:41:41.658 --> 02:41:43.293
AMOUNTS THAT PEOPLE CAN GET,

02:41:43.360 --> 02:41:44.795
INCLUDING FOR THINGS THAT

02:41:44.861 --> 02:41:46.129
WEREN'T PREVIOUSLY COVERED OR

02:41:46.196 --> 02:41:48.598
YOU HAD TO DO LOTS OF PROVING.

02:41:48.665 --> 02:41:49.566
SO NOW CANCER IS AUTOMATIC. IT

02:41:49.633 --> 02:41:51.601
WASN'T BEFORE. SO YOU HAD THIS

02:41:51.668 --> 02:41:53.303
INFLUX OF NEW PEOPLE COMING TO

02:41:53.370 --> 02:41:56.006
GET THESE TYPES OF BENEFITS AND

02:41:56.073 --> 02:41:57.541
CLAIM THEIR BENEFITS. AND THEN

02:41:57.607 --> 02:41:58.375
WE'VE SEEN THE SKYROCKETING,

02:41:58.442 --> 02:42:01.044
NOT ONLY OF THE NUMBER OF

02:42:01.111 --> 02:42:02.779
PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING A PREDATOR

02:42:02.846 --> 02:42:03.513
TOWARDS OUR VETERANS, BUT ALSO

02:42:03.580 --> 02:42:05.282
THE AMOUNT THAT THEY'RE TAKING

02:42:05.348 --> 02:42:07.384
BECAUSE THE AMOUNT IS SO MUCH.

02:42:07.451 --> 02:42:09.286
AND IT WENT BACK SO FAR. SO I

02:42:09.352 --> 02:42:11.154
STRONGLY ENCOURAGE SUPPORT ON

02:42:11.221 --> 02:42:13.390
SB 694, AND I STRONGLY

02:42:13.457 --> 02:42:15.192
ENCOURAGE THIS BODY TO TAKE OUR

02:42:15.258 --> 02:42:16.793
VETERANS SERIOUS AND ENSURE

02:42:16.860 --> 02:42:17.561
THAT NEXT YEAR, WE HAVE

02:42:17.627 --> 02:42:19.229
ADDITIONAL BILLS ON THIS

02:42:19.296 --> 02:42:21.331
SUBJECT THAT ALLOWS VETERANS IN

02:42:21.398 --> 02:42:22.599
CALIFORNIA TO BE FIRST IN LINE

02:42:22.666 --> 02:42:23.467
FOR THEIR BENEFITS, AND THAT

02:42:23.533 --> 02:42:25.569
THIS STATE IS SUPPORTING THEM

02:42:25.635 --> 02:42:27.904
TO BE FIRST IN LINE FOR THEIR

02:42:27.971 --> 02:42:29.506
BENEFITS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU,

02:42:29.573 --> 02:42:31.641
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. ASSEMBLYMEMBER.

02:42:31.708 --> 02:42:34.377
YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU.

02:42:34.444 --> 02:42:37.614
AND I RISE. AND I LOVE OUR

02:42:37.681 --> 02:42:40.050
VETERAN COMMUNITY. I'VE USED

02:42:40.117 --> 02:42:42.519
MULTIPLE VSOS AS A RECIPIENT OF

02:42:42.586 --> 02:42:44.821
CHAPTER 35 BENEFITS FOR MY

02:42:44.888 --> 02:42:46.656
SCHOOL AS A CALVET FEE WAIVER

02:42:46.723 --> 02:42:49.426
RECIPIENT, BUT LET US LIVE IN

02:42:49.493 --> 02:42:52.329
REALITY THAT THIS MARKET ONLY

02:42:52.395 --> 02:42:55.132
EXISTS BECAUSE OF THE STATE OF

02:42:55.198 --> 02:42:56.299
AFFAIRS THAT SOME OF OUR

02:42:56.366 --> 02:42:57.467
VETERAN OFFICES ARE IN. IT'S

02:42:57.534 --> 02:42:59.436
SOMETHING THAT I'VE HAD TO DEAL

02:42:59.503 --> 02:43:01.238
PERSONALLY WITH. THE LOCAL

02:43:01.304 --> 02:43:02.439
SACRAMENTO VETERANS AFFAIRS

02:43:02.506 --> 02:43:05.275
OFFICE, WHERE OUR CASE WAS

02:43:05.342 --> 02:43:08.211
DROPPED, AND WHEN I REACHED OUT

02:43:08.278 --> 02:43:10.447
TO THE INDIVIDUAL, THEY DIDN'T

02:43:10.514 --> 02:43:12.282
EVEN KNOW WHO WE WERE. WHILE WE

02:43:12.349 --> 02:43:15.051
WERE WAITING ON SPOUSAL

02:43:15.118 --> 02:43:16.520
BENEFITS FOR MY MOTHER TO

02:43:16.586 --> 02:43:20.190
RECEIVE. THE PROBLEM IS WE IN

02:43:20.257 --> 02:43:22.692
THE GOVERNMENT HAVE NOT TAKEN

02:43:22.759 --> 02:43:24.327
CARE OF THE VETERANS AS MUCH AS

02:43:24.394 --> 02:43:25.395
WE COULD, AS WE HAVEN'T GIVEN

02:43:25.462 --> 02:43:27.297
BACK THE SERVICES. IF WE

02:43:27.364 --> 02:43:28.665
HAVEN'T HIRED MORE VETERANS

02:43:28.732 --> 02:43:30.233
AFFAIRS OFFICES AND HELPED THEM.

02:43:30.300 --> 02:43:32.402
SO I'M NOT IN OPPOSITION TO

02:43:32.469 --> 02:43:34.471
THIS BILL. I AM SIMPLY ASKING

02:43:34.538 --> 02:43:37.340
FOR MORE TIME TO GO ALL THE WAY

02:43:37.407 --> 02:43:39.476
UPSTREAM AND FIX THE ISSUE.

02:43:39.543 --> 02:43:41.912
I'VE LIVED THROUGH IT

02:43:41.978 --> 02:43:44.281
PERSONALLY. I HAD THE OPTION

02:43:44.347 --> 02:43:46.449
WHEN OUR CASE WAS DROPPED TO GO

02:43:46.516 --> 02:43:48.285
TO THE FRESNO COUNTY VETERANS

02:43:48.351 --> 02:43:50.654
AFFAIRS BECAUSE I HAVE SUCH A

02:43:50.720 --> 02:43:51.388
GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM.

02:43:51.454 --> 02:43:53.456
AND YOU KNOW HOW SIMPLE THE FIX

02:43:53.523 --> 02:43:56.426
WAS. THEY DIDN'T EVEN TELL US

02:43:56.493 --> 02:43:59.696
THAT THE ADDRESS WAS WRONG AND

02:43:59.763 --> 02:44:02.299
WE HAD TO WAIT SIX MONTHS WHILE

02:44:02.365 --> 02:44:04.401
I TOOK CARE OF EVERYTHING FOR

02:44:04.467 --> 02:44:07.270
MY FAMILY, SIMPLY BECAUSE THE

02:44:07.337 --> 02:44:09.406
OFFICE DIDN'T TELL US THAT THE

02:44:09.472 --> 02:44:11.341
ADDRESS WAS WRONG. I'M BEING

02:44:11.408 --> 02:44:13.410
ASKED TO WAIT TO SUPPORT THIS

02:44:13.476 --> 02:44:15.312
BILL BECAUSE WE'LL FIX IT LATER,

02:44:15.378 --> 02:44:17.414
BUT WHY NOT FIX IT NOW AND

02:44:17.480 --> 02:44:19.549
ADDRESS THE CLAIMS LATER?

02:44:19.616 --> 02:44:20.317
BECAUSE IF WE DO BETTER WITH

02:44:20.383 --> 02:44:21.551
OUR VETERANS AFFAIRS OFFICES,

02:44:21.618 --> 02:44:23.587
IF WE ALLOCATE THE RESOURCES

02:44:23.653 --> 02:44:25.522
NECESSARY, IF WE LOOK AT OUR

02:44:25.589 --> 02:44:26.456
COUNTY BUDGETS IN THE FUTURE,

02:44:26.523 --> 02:44:28.158
THEY'RE NOT DOING WELL. THE TOP

02:44:28.225 --> 02:44:30.827
TEN COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE

02:44:30.894 --> 02:44:32.095
ARE IN MASSIVE DEFICITS. WHAT

02:44:32.162 --> 02:44:34.164
IS THE TRACK RECORD AND WHO

02:44:34.231 --> 02:44:36.466
GETS SERVICES CUT? A LOT OF THE

02:44:36.533 --> 02:44:37.701
TIMES IT'S OUR PUBLIC LIBRARIES

02:44:37.767 --> 02:44:39.202
AND IT'S THE SERVICES TO

02:44:39.269 --> 02:44:40.870
VETERANS. AND IF THAT'S THE

02:44:40.937 --> 02:44:42.105
FUTURE PROJECTION, THESE

02:44:42.172 --> 02:44:44.941
OPTIONS RIGHT NOW ARE ALL WE

02:44:45.008 --> 02:44:47.911
HAVE FOR FAMILIES STARVING.

02:44:47.978 --> 02:44:50.547
THIS MARKET ONLY EXISTS BECAUSE

02:44:50.614 --> 02:44:52.182
THERE'S A DIFFERENT PROBLEM. I

02:44:52.249 --> 02:44:54.384
DON'T AGREE WITH THE SHARKS. I

02:44:54.451 --> 02:44:56.386
DON'T AGREE WITH HOW SOME OF

02:44:56.453 --> 02:44:58.321
THEM ARE PREDATORY AND HOW

02:44:58.388 --> 02:44:59.522
THERE'S MULTIPLE CASES. AND

02:44:59.589 --> 02:45:01.157
I'VE SPOKEN TO MY OWN PERSONAL

02:45:01.224 --> 02:45:02.392
VETERANS SERVICE OFFICE AND I

02:45:02.459 --> 02:45:05.161
SAID, YOU ARE GREAT. YOU ARE

02:45:05.228 --> 02:45:06.329
AMAZING. WOULD YOU SAY THAT'S

02:45:06.396 --> 02:45:07.397
THE SAME STANDARD ACROSS THE

02:45:07.464 --> 02:45:10.233
BOARD? UNEQUIVOCALLY, THAT WAS

02:45:10.300 --> 02:45:11.801
NO, BECAUSE THE RESOURCES ARE

02:45:11.868 --> 02:45:13.236
ALLOCATED DIFFERENT PER COUNTY.

02:45:13.303 --> 02:45:15.605
THE RESOURCES ARE ALLOCATED

02:45:15.672 --> 02:45:16.406
DIFFERENT PER STATE AND THE

02:45:16.473 --> 02:45:18.308
RESOURCES ARE ALLOCATED VERY

02:45:18.375 --> 02:45:20.410
DIFFERENTLY. THAT'S THE

02:45:20.477 --> 02:45:22.412
UPSTREAM PROBLEM AND WE NEED TO

02:45:22.479 --> 02:45:24.614
HANDLE THAT FIRST. NOW BEFORE

02:45:24.681 --> 02:45:27.150
TAKING ON THE PROBLEM THAT'S

02:45:27.217 --> 02:45:28.718
CREATED DOWNSTREAM. SO I

02:45:28.785 --> 02:45:31.788
RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT WE WORK

02:45:31.855 --> 02:45:33.256
ON THIS AND DEDICATE SOME MORE

02:45:33.323 --> 02:45:35.592
TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT FAMILIES

02:45:35.659 --> 02:45:37.394
HAVE ALL THE OPTIONS, BECAUSE

02:45:37.460 --> 02:45:39.396
IT'S THE DIFFERENCE OF WHETHER

02:45:39.462 --> 02:45:41.231
YOU HAVE A HOME OR NOT. IT'S

02:45:41.298 --> 02:45:42.499
THE DIFFERENCE OF WHETHER YOUR

02:45:42.565 --> 02:45:44.534
FAMILY CAN EAT OR NOT. IT'S THE

02:45:44.601 --> 02:45:46.536
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHETHER YOUR

02:45:46.603 --> 02:45:50.040
BROTHERS ARE IN SCHOOL OR NOT.

02:45:50.106 --> 02:45:53.043
THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER

02:45:53.109 --> 02:45:55.979
PATTERSON. YOU'RE RECOGNIZED.

02:45:56.046 --> 02:45:58.181
THANK YOU, MADAM SPEAKER. I

02:45:58.248 --> 02:46:00.850
RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE

02:46:00.917 --> 02:46:04.354
AFTER A LOT OF CONFLICT IN MY

02:46:04.421 --> 02:46:07.090
MIND ON THIS, A LOT OF THE

02:46:07.157 --> 02:46:08.458
SUPPORTERS AND I HAPPEN TO BE

02:46:08.525 --> 02:46:10.527
IN COMMITTEE, ACTUALLY, DURING

02:46:10.593 --> 02:46:11.695
THIS PARTICULAR DEBATE, EVEN

02:46:11.761 --> 02:46:13.330
THOUGH I DON'T SERVE ON THE

02:46:13.396 --> 02:46:15.398
COMMITTEE. BUT I HAD A BILL UP

02:46:15.465 --> 02:46:16.232
BEFORE THE COMMITTEE AT THAT

02:46:16.299 --> 02:46:18.668
TIME. AND SO I LISTENED TO THE

02:46:18.735 --> 02:46:19.536
ENTIRE, YOU KNOW, PRETTY MUCH

02:46:19.602 --> 02:46:21.137
THE WHOLE DEBATE. AND I HAD

02:46:21.204 --> 02:46:24.708
ALSO MANY OF THE SUPPORTERS AND

02:46:24.774 --> 02:46:26.309
SPONSORS OF THE BILL ARE ARE

02:46:26.376 --> 02:46:27.510
FROM MY DISTRICT, ACTUALLY IN

02:46:27.577 --> 02:46:29.546
PLACER COUNTY. AND PART OF THAT

02:46:29.612 --> 02:46:30.380
IS BECAUSE PLACER COUNTY DOES A

02:46:30.447 --> 02:46:33.316
REALLY GREAT JOB AT SERVING

02:46:33.383 --> 02:46:34.651
VETERANS, AND WE ARE FORTUNATE

02:46:34.718 --> 02:46:38.488
TO HAVE THAT. AND ANOTHER

02:46:38.555 --> 02:46:40.156
REASON WHY I'M LEANING TOWARDS

02:46:40.223 --> 02:46:42.292
OR WHY I'M GOING TO BE

02:46:42.359 --> 02:46:44.894
SUPPORTING IT IS I HAD THE

02:46:44.961 --> 02:46:46.262
OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT A.

02:46:46.329 --> 02:46:50.266
MILITARY BASE RECENTLY. AND,

02:46:50.333 --> 02:46:52.802
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU GO IN, AS

02:46:52.869 --> 02:46:54.871
I'M SURE MANY OF YOU KNOW, SORT

02:46:54.938 --> 02:46:57.140
OF IN AN OFFICIAL CAPACITY, YOU

02:46:57.207 --> 02:46:58.775
KNOW, YOU GET THE PROTOCOL

02:46:58.842 --> 02:47:00.510
OFFICE AND, YOU KNOW, THEY KIND

02:47:00.577 --> 02:47:03.279
OF HELP YOU UP AND SHOW YOU

02:47:03.346 --> 02:47:04.581
AROUND AND THOSE KINDS OF

02:47:04.647 --> 02:47:06.282
THINGS. WELL, ONE OF THE

02:47:06.349 --> 02:47:09.386
INDIVIDUALS WHO GAVE ME A TOUR

02:47:09.452 --> 02:47:12.222
WAS A ACTUALLY A CIVILIAN

02:47:12.288 --> 02:47:14.891
CONTRACTOR WHO HAD BEEN REHIRED,

02:47:14.958 --> 02:47:17.060
HAD JUST RECENTLY RETIRED FROM

02:47:17.127 --> 02:47:18.628
THE MILITARY. THIS INDIVIDUAL,

02:47:18.695 --> 02:47:21.965
THIS LADY WAS UNDER 40 YEARS

02:47:22.031 --> 02:47:24.534
OLD. SHE HAD BEEN REHIRED BY

02:47:24.601 --> 02:47:27.337
THE MILITARY TO TO WELCOME

02:47:27.404 --> 02:47:29.672
PEOPLE SUCH AS MYSELF TO THE

02:47:29.739 --> 02:47:31.674
BASE THROUGH THE PROTOCOL

02:47:31.741 --> 02:47:34.344
OFFICE. AND SHE ASKED ME IF I

02:47:34.411 --> 02:47:37.580
KNEW OF ANY, IF I KNEW OF ANY

02:47:37.647 --> 02:47:40.283
JOBS OUT THERE. AND THAT WAS

02:47:40.350 --> 02:47:42.152
REALLY FRUSTRATING TO ME. YOU

02:47:42.218 --> 02:47:43.620
HAVE SOMEBODY WHO DEDICATED

02:47:43.686 --> 02:47:45.321
THEIR CAREER TO SERVING THIS

02:47:45.388 --> 02:47:49.526
NATION, AND AND WE HAVE ALL

02:47:49.592 --> 02:47:51.261
SORTS OF ISSUES WITH WHEN YOU

02:47:51.327 --> 02:47:53.530
LEAVE THE MILITARY, WHAT'S NEXT?

02:47:53.596 --> 02:47:56.199
I SAW THIS WITH MY OWN FAMILY.

02:47:56.266 --> 02:47:57.367
AND SO SOME OF THESE

02:47:57.434 --> 02:47:58.668
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE RETIRING

02:47:58.735 --> 02:48:01.137
FROM THE MILITARY, THEY NEED

02:48:01.204 --> 02:48:04.374
THE ASSISTANCE OF SOMEBODY. AND

02:48:04.441 --> 02:48:06.209
THAT'S WHY I THINK THE CONFLICT

02:48:06.276 --> 02:48:07.444
IS THERE WITH THIS BILL, IS

02:48:07.510 --> 02:48:09.245
THAT THEY REACH OUT TO SOME OF

02:48:09.312 --> 02:48:12.382
THESE GROUPS ASKING FOR HELP.

02:48:12.449 --> 02:48:13.616
AND WHAT'S REALLY FRUSTRATING

02:48:13.683 --> 02:48:16.453
ABOUT THIS BILL, IF I CAN BE

02:48:16.519 --> 02:48:18.288
HONEST WITH YOU, IS WE ACTUALLY

02:48:18.354 --> 02:48:20.924
DID HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO FIX

02:48:20.990 --> 02:48:22.091
THIS BILL. WE HAD AN

02:48:22.158 --> 02:48:23.259
OPPORTUNITY, I THINK, TO

02:48:23.326 --> 02:48:26.396
CONSIDER AMENDMENTS, TO ADD

02:48:26.463 --> 02:48:28.264
GUARDRAILS, TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:48:28.331 --> 02:48:31.401
PEOPLE WHO NEED THE HELP CAN

02:48:31.468 --> 02:48:34.003
FIND SOMEBODY AND, YES, MAYBE

02:48:34.070 --> 02:48:35.472
GET COMPENSATED. AND THIS ISN'T

02:48:35.538 --> 02:48:37.340
THE ONLY FIELD IN WHICH THIS

02:48:37.407 --> 02:48:41.277
HAPPENS, BY THE WAY. AND THERE

02:48:41.344 --> 02:48:43.313
ARE PREDATORS IN EVERY INDUSTRY

02:48:43.379 --> 02:48:45.081
IN WHICH THIS OCCURS. BUT I

02:48:45.148 --> 02:48:47.650
FEEL BAD THAT WE'RE KIND OF

02:48:47.717 --> 02:48:49.085
LIMITING THAT OPTION, THE

02:48:49.152 --> 02:48:51.254
OPPORTUNITY. AND MAYBE THERE'LL

02:48:51.321 --> 02:48:52.522
BE REGULATIONS, MAYBE THERE'LL

02:48:52.589 --> 02:48:54.424
BE THINGS. BUT WE ACTUALLY HAD

02:48:54.491 --> 02:48:56.993
THE OPPORTUNITY TO FIX THIS IN

02:48:57.060 --> 02:48:58.294
THIS BILL. AND IT'S FRUSTRATING

02:48:58.361 --> 02:49:01.297
THAT WE DIDN'T. BUT THAT SAID,

02:49:01.364 --> 02:49:03.199
ON THE WHOLE, YOU KNOW, I'M

02:49:03.266 --> 02:49:05.401
100% AGAINST HARMS TO OUR

02:49:05.468 --> 02:49:09.239
VETERAN COMMUNITY. AND WITH THE

02:49:09.305 --> 02:49:11.808
BILL THAT'S IN FRONT OF US, I

02:49:11.875 --> 02:49:14.344
HAVE TO SUPPORT THE BILL AND

02:49:14.410 --> 02:49:16.412
MAKE SURE THAT OUR VETERANS ARE

02:49:16.479 --> 02:49:18.281
NOT TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. BUT I

02:49:18.348 --> 02:49:20.149
HOPE THE AUTHOR AND OTHERS, AND

02:49:20.216 --> 02:49:21.351
I KNOW THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

02:49:21.417 --> 02:49:23.686
ISSUE TO THE FLOOR MANAGER,

02:49:23.753 --> 02:49:25.388
THAT WE ADDRESS THIS

02:49:25.455 --> 02:49:28.424
EXPEDITIOUSLY IN THE NEXT YEAR

02:49:28.491 --> 02:49:31.561
TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE CAN

02:49:31.628 --> 02:49:32.462
GET THE HELP IF THEY NEED,

02:49:32.529 --> 02:49:35.598
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT AGAIN, TO

02:49:35.665 --> 02:49:36.566
MEET WITH AN INDIVIDUAL WHO

02:49:36.633 --> 02:49:39.135
JUST SERVED OUR NATION FOR 20

02:49:39.202 --> 02:49:42.305
YEARS AND NOT EVEN 40 YEARS OLD,

02:49:42.372 --> 02:49:43.606
AND TELL ME THAT THEY HAVE

02:49:43.673 --> 02:49:45.375
ISSUES SERVING OUR NATION, WE

02:49:45.441 --> 02:49:47.577
CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT. AND TO

02:49:47.644 --> 02:49:50.513
MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO WHO

02:49:50.580 --> 02:49:54.417
IS HERE IN SPIRIT. YOU KNOW, HE

02:49:54.484 --> 02:49:56.185
DID BRING UP A GOOD POINT THAT

02:49:56.252 --> 02:49:57.820
WE DO MAKE POLICY CHOICES IN

02:49:57.887 --> 02:49:59.289
THIS BUILDING ABOUT WHAT WE'RE

02:49:59.355 --> 02:50:00.590
GOING TO FUND AND THE KIND OF

02:50:00.657 --> 02:50:02.158
SERVICES THAT WE'RE GOING TO

02:50:02.225 --> 02:50:04.761
FUND. WE COULD FUND THIS

02:50:04.827 --> 02:50:07.263
SERVICE FOR OUR VETERANS IF WE

02:50:07.330 --> 02:50:08.565
WANTED TO. AND IT'S SOMETHING

02:50:08.631 --> 02:50:10.199
THAT WE SHOULD DEFINITELY THINK

02:50:10.266 --> 02:50:12.035
ABOUT THAT FOR NOW. I ASK FOR

02:50:12.101 --> 02:50:13.336
AN AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK

02:50:13.403 --> 02:50:15.104
YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. ASSEMBLY

02:50:15.171 --> 02:50:16.773
MEMBER. CARRILLO. YOU'RE

02:50:16.839 --> 02:50:18.408
RECOGNIZED. YEAH. THANK YOU,

02:50:18.474 --> 02:50:20.343
MADAM SPEAKER. I RISE TODAY IN

02:50:20.410 --> 02:50:22.478
SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL 694,

02:50:22.545 --> 02:50:23.379
WHICH STRENGTHENS CALIFORNIA'S

02:50:23.446 --> 02:50:24.380
COMMITMENT TO PROTECTING

02:50:24.447 --> 02:50:25.782
VETERANS DURING FEDERAL CLAIM

02:50:25.848 --> 02:50:27.617
PROCESS. MORE IMPORTANTLY,

02:50:27.684 --> 02:50:29.252
REAFFIRMS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO

02:50:29.319 --> 02:50:30.720
ENSURE THAT VETERANS CAN

02:50:30.787 --> 02:50:31.487
SUCCESSFULLY RECOVER THE FULL

02:50:31.554 --> 02:50:33.489
AMOUNT OF BENEFITS THAT THEY

02:50:33.556 --> 02:50:35.024
HAVE EARNED THROUGH MILITARY

02:50:35.091 --> 02:50:36.125
SERVICE COMPANIES THAT HAVE

02:50:36.192 --> 02:50:37.694
TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF VETERANS AND

02:50:37.760 --> 02:50:38.328
EXPLOIT THOSE WHO HAVE

02:50:38.394 --> 02:50:40.530
HONORABLY SERVED OUR COUNTRY

02:50:40.597 --> 02:50:43.232
SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE ON A

02:50:43.299 --> 02:50:44.300
CREDIT CARD. COMPANIES THAT

02:50:44.367 --> 02:50:45.501
HAVE NO FORMAL TRAINING IN THE

02:50:45.568 --> 02:50:46.402
VA SYSTEM AND OPERATE OUTSIDE

02:50:46.469 --> 02:50:49.005
OF FEDERAL LAW MUST BE MET WITH

02:50:49.072 --> 02:50:50.473
OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY.

02:50:50.540 --> 02:50:52.275
SB 694 STANDS FOR THE

02:50:52.342 --> 02:50:53.843
PRINCIPLES THAT ANY BUSINESS

02:50:53.910 --> 02:50:54.611
THAT PROVIDES ASSISTANCE TO

02:50:54.677 --> 02:50:56.646
VETERANS IN FILING A CLAIM FOR

02:50:56.713 --> 02:50:58.381
VA BENEFITS MUST ADHERE TO THE

02:50:58.448 --> 02:50:59.215
PROFESSIONAL AND ETHICAL

02:50:59.282 --> 02:51:02.318
STANDARDS SET BY THE VA. THIS

02:51:02.385 --> 02:51:04.454
LEGISLATION IS A SIMPLE WAY TO

02:51:04.520 --> 02:51:05.221
HELP PROTECT VETERANS AND

02:51:05.288 --> 02:51:06.889
ENSURE THAT VETERANS RECEIVE

02:51:06.956 --> 02:51:08.424
THE FULL AMOUNT OF THEIR

02:51:08.491 --> 02:51:09.258
RIGHTFULLY EARNED BENEFITS. I'M

02:51:09.325 --> 02:51:10.593
PROUD TO STAND WITH MY

02:51:10.660 --> 02:51:12.662
COLLEAGUE IN FIGHTING TO

02:51:12.729 --> 02:51:13.096
PROTECT VETERANS AND

02:51:13.162 --> 02:51:14.230
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE.

02:51:14.297 --> 02:51:18.735
THANK YOU. THANK YOU, ASSEMBLY

02:51:18.801 --> 02:51:19.702
MEMBER, ASSEMBLY MEMBER JEFF

02:51:19.769 --> 02:51:25.408
GONZALEZ. YOU'RE RECOGNIZED.

02:51:25.475 --> 02:51:29.946
COLLEAGUES. SB 694 IS BEFORE US

02:51:30.013 --> 02:51:32.215
TODAY. MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES IN

02:51:32.281 --> 02:51:34.384
THIS BODY HAVE ASKED FOR MY

02:51:34.450 --> 02:51:35.685
OPINION BECAUSE I'M THE ONLY

02:51:35.752 --> 02:51:38.554
VETERAN IN THIS BODY AND

02:51:38.621 --> 02:51:39.656
BECAUSE I'M 100% SERVICE

02:51:39.722 --> 02:51:42.392
CONNECTED, DISABLED WITH A

02:51:42.458 --> 02:51:44.127
COMBAT RELATED SERVICE

02:51:44.193 --> 02:51:46.195
CONNECTION. LET ME ATTEMPT TO

02:51:46.262 --> 02:51:49.065
PRESENT THIS IN A WAY THAT IS

02:51:49.132 --> 02:51:50.633
HONORING TO BOTH SIDES OF THIS

02:51:50.700 --> 02:51:55.905
EQUATION. LET ME ALSO BE CLEAR.

02:51:55.972 --> 02:51:59.542
THIS IS NOT A PARTIZAN ISSUE.

02:51:59.609 --> 02:52:02.412
THIS IS NOT A PARTIZAN ISSUE.

02:52:02.478 --> 02:52:06.482
THIS IS ONLY ABOUT THE US

02:52:06.549 --> 02:52:09.352
SERVICE MEMBER, THE WARRIOR

02:52:09.419 --> 02:52:11.754
THAT MADE A DECISION TO DEFEND

02:52:11.821 --> 02:52:12.689
OUR FREEDOMS AND THEIR ABILITY

02:52:12.755 --> 02:52:16.059
TO GET THEIR BENEFITS AND

02:52:16.125 --> 02:52:17.694
SERVICES THAT THEY DESPERATELY

02:52:17.760 --> 02:52:22.732
NEED. THIS BILL HAS MANY IN

02:52:22.799 --> 02:52:28.004
THIS BODY SPLIT. ON ONE SIDE.

02:52:28.071 --> 02:52:31.207
SB 694 WOULD BAN COMPANIES FROM

02:52:31.274 --> 02:52:32.408
CHARGING VETERANS TO ASSIST

02:52:32.475 --> 02:52:34.143
THEM ON RETAINING THEIR

02:52:34.210 --> 02:52:35.244
BENEFITS. VETERANS WOULD ONLY

02:52:35.311 --> 02:52:37.447
BE AUTHORIZED TO USE THE FREE

02:52:37.513 --> 02:52:39.315
SERVICES PROVIDED BY ACCREDITED

02:52:39.382 --> 02:52:42.385
VETERAN SERVICES OFFICERS. THIS

02:52:42.452 --> 02:52:45.621
BILL ANSWERS THE PROBLEM OF

02:52:45.688 --> 02:52:46.989
CLAIM SHARKS TAKING ADVANTAGE

02:52:47.056 --> 02:52:50.593
OF VETERANS BY CHARGING THEM

02:52:50.660 --> 02:52:53.296
ASTRONOMICAL FEES. ON THE OTHER

02:52:53.362 --> 02:52:56.599
SIDE, MANY OPPOSE THIS BILL

02:52:56.666 --> 02:52:58.735
BECAUSE IT REMOVES THE VETERANS

02:52:58.801 --> 02:53:01.471
CHOICE OF CHOOSING THEIR OWN

02:53:01.537 --> 02:53:05.408
PATH TO RETAIN SERVICES. SOME

02:53:05.475 --> 02:53:07.310
SAY THAT IF THEY WANT TO CHOOSE

02:53:07.376 --> 02:53:10.780
TO GET FREE SERVICES OR PAID

02:53:10.847 --> 02:53:12.682
SERVICES, IT'S THEIR CHOICE.

02:53:12.749 --> 02:53:16.285
THEY FOUGHT FOR IT. I BELIEVE

02:53:16.352 --> 02:53:18.321
THIS BODY IS THIS BODY

02:53:18.387 --> 02:53:20.156
ULTIMATELY WANTS TO PROTECT OUR

02:53:20.223 --> 02:53:24.160
VETERANS. MOREOVER, BOTH BOTH

02:53:24.227 --> 02:53:26.662
SIDES HAVE PRESENTED COMPELLING

02:53:26.729 --> 02:53:28.798
ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF THEIR

02:53:28.865 --> 02:53:32.068
RESPECTIVE GROUPS. FURTHERMORE,

02:53:32.135 --> 02:53:34.804
I HAVE PERSONALLY SPOKEN TO THE

02:53:34.871 --> 02:53:37.440
AUTHOR AND BOTH ADVOCACY GROUPS.

02:53:37.507 --> 02:53:40.743
I WILL BE PRESENTING A BILL

02:53:40.810 --> 02:53:43.513
NEXT YEAR WHICH WILL BUILD A

02:53:43.579 --> 02:53:45.615
FRAMEWORK TO REGULATE THIS

02:53:45.681 --> 02:53:48.151
INDUSTRY. SO AS YOU CONSIDER

02:53:48.217 --> 02:53:50.920
YOUR VOTE, I WOULD ASK YOU TO

02:53:50.987 --> 02:53:54.457
THINK ABOUT THIS. IF THIS BILL

02:53:54.524 --> 02:53:57.160
PASSES, WHAT UNINTENDED

02:53:57.226 --> 02:54:00.029
CONSEQUENCES DOES THIS HAVE ON

02:54:00.096 --> 02:54:01.097
THE GOOD ACTOR BUSINESSES AND

02:54:01.164 --> 02:54:03.666
THE VETERANS WHICH HAVE PAID A

02:54:03.733 --> 02:54:05.501
COMPANY? DO THEY LOSE THEIR

02:54:05.568 --> 02:54:07.236
MONEY? ARE THEY STUCK IN THE

02:54:07.303 --> 02:54:10.139
SYSTEM? ARE THEY IN LIMBO? IF

02:54:10.206 --> 02:54:12.408
THIS BILL DOES NOT PASS, WHAT

02:54:12.475 --> 02:54:14.277
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES DOES

02:54:14.343 --> 02:54:16.345
THIS HAVE ON THE VETERANS THAT

02:54:16.412 --> 02:54:20.249
ARE GETTING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF

02:54:20.316 --> 02:54:23.519
AND THE INCREASE IN BAD ACTORS?

02:54:23.586 --> 02:54:26.422
WITH THAT, THERE'S MUCH TO

02:54:26.489 --> 02:54:29.592
CONSIDER, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,

02:54:29.659 --> 02:54:32.528
I RESPECTFULLY ASK, AND THIS IS

02:54:32.595 --> 02:54:35.698
MY RECOMMENDATION ON THIS BILL.

02:54:35.765 --> 02:54:37.200
I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU

02:54:37.266 --> 02:54:41.504
VOTE IN FAVOR OF YOUR DISTRICT

02:54:41.571 --> 02:54:47.343
AND YOUR VETERANS. SEEING AND

02:54:47.410 --> 02:54:48.544
HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE.

02:54:48.611 --> 02:54:49.545
ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S WOULD YOU LIKE

02:54:49.612 --> 02:54:52.648
TO CLOSE? YES. THANK YOU. I

02:54:52.715 --> 02:54:54.450
WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES

02:54:54.517 --> 02:54:56.419
TODAY FOR THE HEALTHY DEBATE ON

02:54:56.485 --> 02:54:58.221
THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT

02:54:58.287 --> 02:55:00.957
REALLY IMPACTS OUR VETERANS SO

02:55:01.023 --> 02:55:02.458
DEEPLY. AS THE DAUGHTER OF A

02:55:02.525 --> 02:55:04.360
DISABLED VETERAN WHO RELIED ON

02:55:04.427 --> 02:55:07.163
THESE BENEFITS, AND WHO HIMSELF

02:55:07.230 --> 02:55:08.164
HAD FRUSTRATIONS WITH GETTING

02:55:08.231 --> 02:55:11.767
DENIED FROM THE VA, I KNOW THAT

02:55:11.834 --> 02:55:12.368
IT'S NOT A PERFECT SYSTEM, AND

02:55:12.435 --> 02:55:14.503
I LOOK FORWARD TO A BIPARTISAN

02:55:14.570 --> 02:55:17.273
AND UNIFIED FRONT TO REALLY

02:55:17.340 --> 02:55:20.409
FIGHT FOR A VA THAT TRULY IS

02:55:20.476 --> 02:55:22.144
EQUIPPED TO SERVE OUR VETERANS

02:55:22.211 --> 02:55:26.716
FULLY AND LIKEWISE, TO FULLY

02:55:26.782 --> 02:55:29.352
FUND VSOS. I KNOW THAT ALL

02:55:29.418 --> 02:55:31.520
COUNTY VSOS ARE NOT CREATED

02:55:31.587 --> 02:55:33.322
EQUALLY, BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT

02:55:33.389 --> 02:55:35.091
THESE ARE VETERANS HELPING

02:55:35.157 --> 02:55:36.759
VETERANS, AND THEY DON'T HAVE

02:55:36.826 --> 02:55:38.427
AN EIGHT MINUTE LIMIT TO HAVE A

02:55:38.494 --> 02:55:39.695
CONVERSATION ON A PHONE WITH

02:55:39.762 --> 02:55:41.731
SOMEONE SO THEY CAN MOVE TO THE

02:55:41.797 --> 02:55:43.599
NEXT PERSON TO TRY TO MAKE MORE

02:55:43.666 --> 02:55:45.201
MONEY OFF THAT NEXT VETERAN

02:55:45.268 --> 02:55:48.137
LIKE THE PREDATORS DO. I KNOW

02:55:48.204 --> 02:55:49.238
THAT OUR COUNTY VSOS ARE THE

02:55:49.305 --> 02:55:51.340
ONES WHO WILL HAVE A LONG

02:55:51.407 --> 02:55:52.575
CONVERSATION ABOUT. DO YOU ALSO

02:55:52.642 --> 02:55:54.377
NEED HOUSING ASSISTANCE? DO YOU

02:55:54.443 --> 02:55:56.846
ALSO NEED HELP WITH HEALTH CARE

02:55:56.913 --> 02:55:57.613
OR MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT?

02:55:57.680 --> 02:55:59.315
BECAUSE THEY'RE TRAINED AND

02:55:59.382 --> 02:56:00.416
THEY GO THROUGH AN

02:56:00.483 --> 02:56:01.550
ACCREDITATION PROCESS THROUGH

02:56:01.617 --> 02:56:03.352
THE VA TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE

02:56:03.419 --> 02:56:05.454
VETERAN. AND SO THIS, AS MY

02:56:05.521 --> 02:56:07.223
COLLEAGUE FROM SUSAN CITY

02:56:07.290 --> 02:56:09.692
POINTED OUT, THERE IS AN

02:56:09.759 --> 02:56:12.194
ACCREDITATION PROCESS. NOW YOU

02:56:12.261 --> 02:56:13.996
CAN GO THROUGH THE VA

02:56:14.063 --> 02:56:15.464
ACCREDITATION PROCESS. THE

02:56:15.531 --> 02:56:17.199
ATTORNEYS THAT WERE MENTIONED

02:56:17.266 --> 02:56:18.901
HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE

02:56:18.968 --> 02:56:20.636
ACCREDITATION PROCESS. THEY ARE

02:56:20.703 --> 02:56:22.338
LIMITED ON WHAT THEY CAN CHARGE,

02:56:22.405 --> 02:56:23.539
AND THEY CANNOT CHARGE FOR

02:56:23.606 --> 02:56:25.241
INITIAL CLAIMS. THEY CAN ONLY

02:56:25.308 --> 02:56:28.444
DO, YOU KNOW, APPEALS ON

02:56:28.511 --> 02:56:30.646
DENIALS. SO THERE ARE LIMITS

02:56:30.713 --> 02:56:33.282
AND AND GUARDRAILS THAT EXIST

02:56:33.349 --> 02:56:36.385
RIGHT NOW THAT THESE CLAIM

02:56:36.452 --> 02:56:38.454
SHARKS ARE CHOOSING NOT TO GO

02:56:38.521 --> 02:56:40.356
THROUGH BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT

02:56:40.423 --> 02:56:41.691
THEY CAN GET THE BIGGEST BANG

02:56:41.757 --> 02:56:44.260
FOR THEIR BUCK FOR INITIAL

02:56:44.327 --> 02:56:45.795
CLAIMS. THEY TRY TO PUSH FROM

02:56:45.861 --> 02:56:48.197
GOING 0 TO 100% SO THEY CAN GET

02:56:48.264 --> 02:56:49.465
A PERCENTAGE OF THAT AND CHARGE

02:56:49.532 --> 02:56:54.036
PEOPLE UP TO $22,000. DISABLED

02:56:54.103 --> 02:56:56.105
VETERANS OUT OF THEIR POCKETS.

02:56:56.172 --> 02:56:59.608
WE HAVE TALKED A LOT THIS YEAR

02:56:59.675 --> 02:57:01.177
ABOUT AFFORDABILITY. WE HAVE

02:57:01.243 --> 02:57:04.413
TALKED A LOT ABOUT HOW WE CAN

02:57:04.480 --> 02:57:06.716
KEEP MONEY AND PUT MONEY BACK

02:57:06.782 --> 02:57:08.451
INTO CALIFORNIANS POCKETS. I'LL

02:57:08.517 --> 02:57:10.486
TELL YOU WHAT'S NOT DEBATABLE.

02:57:10.553 --> 02:57:13.622
IS $22,000 KEPT IN A VETERAN'S

02:57:13.689 --> 02:57:16.459
POCKET? THAT IS REAL MONEY AND

02:57:16.525 --> 02:57:18.094
REAL IMPACT ON DISABLED

02:57:18.160 --> 02:57:21.530
VETERANS LIVES THAT WE NEED TO

02:57:21.597 --> 02:57:24.233
MAKE SURE IS PROTECTED. ONE OF

02:57:24.300 --> 02:57:26.635
THE YOU KNOW, THERE'S BEEN THIS

02:57:26.702 --> 02:57:29.438
THIS HAS BEEN A A SOMEWHAT

02:57:29.505 --> 02:57:30.973
CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE IN SOME

02:57:31.040 --> 02:57:32.274

AISLE HAVE BEEN SUPPORTIVE IN

02:57:47.623 --> 02:57:51.594
COMMITTEES AS WELL. I AGREE WE

02:57:51.660 --> 02:57:53.329
GOT TO DO BETTER WITH OUR VSOS.

02:57:53.396 --> 02:57:55.097
WE HAVE TO SUPPORT THEM MORE.

02:57:55.164 --> 02:57:56.899
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE IN

02:57:56.966 --> 02:57:58.534

02:58:02.204 --> 02:58:03.739
COLLEAGUE, SENATOR ARCHULETA

SURE IT'S AVAILABLE TO HIS

02:58:08.511 --> 02:58:10.379

02:58:10.446 --> 02:58:11.614
MAKE SURE THAT IN MY COMMUNITY

STAYS IN MY HEAD, AS I HAVE

02:58:27.430 --> 02:58:30.766
TALKED WITH FOLKS ON THIS FLOOR,

THEY HAVE NEVER, EVER SEEN AN

02:58:42.445 --> 02:58:45.147
ISSUE WHERE IT IS SO HARD FOR

02:58:45.214 --> 02:58:48.084
VETERANS TO BE HEARD. AND SO I

02:58:48.150 --> 02:58:49.418
HOPE THAT YOU WILL JOIN ME

02:58:49.485 --> 02:58:51.320

SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED AND THEY
