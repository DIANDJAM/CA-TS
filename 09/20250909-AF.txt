AND OTHERS AN ACCOLADE TO

02:06:29.415 --> 02:06:39.024
CRIMES. ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATEL.

02:06:39.091 --> 02:06:41.393
YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU,

02:06:41.460 --> 02:06:43.929
MR. SPEAKER. I RISE TODAY TO

02:06:43.996 --> 02:06:45.597
PRESENT SB 19, AN IMPORTANT

02:06:45.664 --> 02:06:48.267
PUBLIC SAFETY BILL THAT I HAVE

02:06:48.334 --> 02:06:50.069
COAUTHORED WITH SENATOR RUBIO,

02:06:50.135 --> 02:06:52.905
THREATS MADE AGAINST PLACES OF

02:06:52.972 --> 02:06:54.006
WORSHIP, MEDICAL FACILITIES AND

02:06:54.073 --> 02:06:56.275
WORKPLACES ARE JUST WRONG. AND

02:06:56.342 --> 02:06:58.210
THREATS MADE AGAINST SCHOOLS IN

02:06:58.277 --> 02:07:00.112
PARTICULAR, WHICH HAS HAPPENED

02:07:00.179 --> 02:07:02.514
IN MY DISTRICT, ARE DEVASTATING.

02:07:02.581 --> 02:07:04.216
THEY CAN DISRUPT LEARNING,

02:07:04.283 --> 02:07:05.884
TRAUMATIZE STUDENTS AND

02:07:05.951 --> 02:07:08.587
TEACHERS, AND LEAVE CHILDREN

02:07:08.654 --> 02:07:11.290
FEARING FOR THEIR SAFETY.

02:07:11.357 --> 02:07:14.193
UNFORTUNATELY, RIGHT NOW IN

02:07:14.259 --> 02:07:15.094
CALIFORNIA, OUR LAWS FALL SHORT

02:07:15.160 --> 02:07:17.496
IN PROTECTING OUR SCHOOLS AND

02:07:17.563 --> 02:07:18.364
OTHER VULNERABLE PLACES FROM

02:07:18.430 --> 02:07:20.966
THESE TYPES OF CRIMINAL THREATS.

02:07:21.033 --> 02:07:23.302
SB 19 IS A CRITICAL MEASURE

02:07:23.369 --> 02:07:25.637
THAT WILL PROTECT THESE

02:07:25.704 --> 02:07:27.206
LOCATIONS. EXISTING LAW SAYS

02:07:27.272 --> 02:07:29.274
THAT IT'S A CRIME TO MAKE A

02:07:29.341 --> 02:07:30.809
CREDIBLE THREAT TO A SERIOUS,

02:07:30.876 --> 02:07:32.611
TO SERIOUSLY HARM OR KILL

02:07:32.678 --> 02:07:35.414
ANOTHER PERSON. BUT THERE'S A

02:07:35.481 --> 02:07:37.249
DANGEROUS LOOPHOLE IN THE LAW.

02:07:37.316 --> 02:07:40.185
AND WHAT IT LEAVES OPEN IS THAT

02:07:40.252 --> 02:07:43.155
A SPECIFIC PERSON MUST BE NAMED

02:07:43.222 --> 02:07:44.456
IN THAT THREAT. WITHOUT A

02:07:44.523 --> 02:07:47.359
DIRECT THREAT. LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:07:47.426 --> 02:07:49.294
OFFICIALS HAVE LIMITED OPTIONS,

02:07:49.361 --> 02:07:52.197
EVEN WHEN THE DANGER IS CLEAR.

02:07:52.264 --> 02:07:54.066
THIS PROBLEM IS NOT

02:07:54.133 --> 02:07:55.601
HYPOTHETICAL. IT'S REAL, AND

02:07:55.667 --> 02:07:58.003
IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW ACROSS

02:07:58.070 --> 02:08:01.173
CALIFORNIA. THAT'S WHY SB 19 IS

02:08:01.240 --> 02:08:02.941
IMPORTANT AND REALLY CRITICAL.

02:08:03.008 --> 02:08:05.210
IT WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR LAW

02:08:05.277 --> 02:08:06.945
ENFORCEMENT TO HOLD PEOPLE

02:08:07.012 --> 02:08:08.147
ACCOUNTABLE WHEN THEY WANT TO

02:08:08.213 --> 02:08:09.381
TERRORIZE OTHERS WITH THREATS

02:08:09.448 --> 02:08:10.916
BY MAKING SERIOUS THREATS

02:08:10.983 --> 02:08:13.085
AGAINST, FOR EXAMPLE, DAYCARES,

02:08:13.152 --> 02:08:15.254
SCHOOLS, UNIVERSITIES,

02:08:15.320 --> 02:08:16.155
WORKPLACES, HOUSES OF WORSHIP

02:08:16.221 --> 02:08:19.224
OR MEDICAL FACILITIES. SB 19

02:08:19.291 --> 02:08:20.993
HAS PASSED WITH UNANIMOUS

02:08:21.060 --> 02:08:22.294

04:15:42.694 --> 04:15:44.062
OFTEN PUSH PATIENTS TOWARDS

04:15:44.128 --> 04:15:45.296
DRUGS AND HIGHER OUT-OF-POCKET

04:15:45.363 --> 04:15:47.999
COSTS. THE REASON THAT PBMS

04:15:48.066 --> 04:15:49.300
OFTEN FAVOR HIGHER COST DRUGS

04:15:49.367 --> 04:15:51.302
ARE BECAUSE OF REBATES, SINCE

04:15:51.369 --> 04:15:53.237
PBMS OWN THEIR OWN HEALTH PLANS

04:15:53.304 --> 04:15:55.206
AND MAIL ORDER PHARMACIES, THEY

04:15:55.273 --> 04:15:56.374
HAVE GREAT INCENTIVE TO STEER

04:15:56.441 --> 04:15:57.475
PATIENTS TOWARD THEIR OWN

04:15:57.542 --> 04:15:59.310
AFFILIATED PHARMACIES AWAY FROM

04:15:59.377 --> 04:16:01.212
BRICK AND MORTAR AND

04:16:01.279 --> 04:16:02.647
NEIGHBORHOOD PHARMACIES,

04:16:02.714 --> 04:16:03.314
PUTTING THOSE INDEPENDENT

04:16:03.381 --> 04:16:06.317
PHARMACISTS IN JEOPARDY. PBMS

04:16:06.384 --> 04:16:07.051
CONTROL PHARMACY REIMBURSEMENTS

04:16:07.118 --> 04:16:08.386
AND OFTEN SET RATES THAT FAVOR

04:16:08.453 --> 04:16:11.222
THEIR OWN AFFILIATES. LEADING

04:16:11.289 --> 04:16:12.056
INDEPENDENT PHARMACIES

04:16:12.123 --> 04:16:13.958
UNDERPAID, SOMETIMES BELOW DRUG

04:16:14.025 --> 04:16:15.560
COSTS, CAUSING FINANCIAL LOSSES

04:16:15.626 --> 04:16:17.361
ON ESSENTIAL MEDICATIONS. MOST

04:16:17.428 --> 04:16:19.230
PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE

04:16:19.297 --> 04:16:21.099
LACK OF CHOICE BY MAIL ORDER BY

04:16:21.165 --> 04:16:22.333
PBMS, THOUGH THE AMOUNT OF

04:16:22.400 --> 04:16:25.036
MEDICATION THEY ARE ABLE TO GET

04:16:25.103 --> 04:16:27.638
DOESN'T CHANGE. PATIENTS CAN

04:16:27.705 --> 04:16:28.606
RECEIVE A 90 DAY SUPPLY THROUGH

04:16:28.673 --> 04:16:30.174
PBM MAIL ORDERS, BUT ARE OFTEN

04:16:30.241 --> 04:16:32.944
LIMITED TO A 30 DAY, 30 DAYS AT

04:16:33.010 --> 04:16:35.179
LOCAL PHARMACIES, A POLICY THAT

04:16:35.246 --> 04:16:36.981
STEERS US TOWARD MAIL ORDER AND

04:16:37.048 --> 04:16:39.050
IMPACTS COMMUNITY PHARMACIES.

04:16:39.117 --> 04:16:42.320
MEMBERS PBMS OPERATE WITH NO

04:16:42.386 --> 04:16:42.754
TRANSPARENCY AND NO

04:16:42.820 --> 04:16:44.455
ACCOUNTABILITY, AND PATIENTS

04:16:44.522 --> 04:16:45.323
BEAR THE COST, WHETHER IT'S

04:16:45.389 --> 04:16:46.991
THROUGH HIGHER PREMIUMS,

04:16:47.058 --> 04:16:48.059
INCREASED OUT-OF-POCKET

04:16:48.126 --> 04:16:49.727
EXPENSES OR BEING DENIED TIMELY

04:16:49.794 --> 04:16:51.929
ACCESS TO THEIR MEDICATION. I

04:16:51.996 --> 04:16:53.765
RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE

04:16:53.831 --> 04:16:56.000

FULLY LICENSE AND REGULATE PBMS,

04:17:12.250 --> 04:17:14.418
ENSURING THE STATE WILL COLLECT

04:17:14.485 --> 04:17:16.087
COMPREHENSIVE DATA TO GUIDE

04:17:16.154 --> 04:17:18.990
MEANINGFUL REFORM. SB 41 PUSHES

04:17:19.056 --> 04:17:21.192
SWEEPING CHANGES WITHOUT THAT

04:17:21.259 --> 04:17:22.026
INFORMATION, PUTTING THE CART

04:17:22.093 --> 04:17:24.495
BEFORE THE HORSE. WE OWE

04:17:24.562 --> 04:17:25.263
CALIFORNIANS REFORMS BASED ON

04:17:25.329 --> 04:17:27.265
FACTS AND NOT ASSUMPTIONS, AND

04:17:27.331 --> 04:17:29.367
THE STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER

04:17:29.433 --> 04:17:31.269
FOR CALIFORNIANS. 15 MILLION

04:17:31.335 --> 04:17:33.237
LATINOS, THE FRONTLINE WORKERS,

04:17:33.304 --> 04:17:35.540
SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND

04:17:35.606 --> 04:17:36.974
MULTIGENERATIONAL CAREGIVERS.

04:17:37.041 --> 04:17:39.977
THIS IS NOT AN ABSTRACT DEBATE.

04:17:40.044 --> 04:17:42.446
THESE ARE THE COMMUNITIES WHERE

04:17:42.513 --> 04:17:44.248
PHARMACIES CLOSE, FIRST

04:17:44.315 --> 04:17:46.117
PREMIUMS RISE FASTEST AND

04:17:46.184 --> 04:17:48.219
ONLINE ONLY MANDATES IT HIT

04:17:48.286 --> 04:17:51.289
HARDEST. SB 41 THREATENS ACCESS

04:17:51.355 --> 04:17:53.925
TO CARE, AND THAT MEANS REAL

04:17:53.991 --> 04:17:55.793
HARM TO REAL FAMILIES. FOR

04:17:55.860 --> 04:17:56.394
THESE REASONS, I RESPECTFULLY

04:17:56.460 --> 04:18:00.198

DO YOU WISH TO CLOSE? THANK YOU.

04:18:08.105 --> 04:18:09.307
MEMBERS, I RESPECTFULLY

04:18:09.373 --> 04:18:11.709
DISAGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM

04:18:11.776 --> 04:18:13.611
CONTRA COSTA. THIS PIECE OF

04:18:13.678 --> 04:18:15.313
LEGISLATION AND THE PBM REFORM

04:18:15.379 --> 04:18:18.115

NEGOTIATED OVER THE COURSE OF

04:18:19.250 --> 04:18:20.918
TWO YEARS, TWO LEGISLATIVE

04:18:20.985 --> 04:18:23.221
CYCLES. WE UNDERSTAND VERY MUCH

04:18:23.287 --> 04:18:25.890
SO AND HAVE ALREADY EXPERIENCED

04:18:25.957 --> 04:18:28.192
THE CLOSURES OF OUR INDEPENDENT

04:18:28.259 --> 04:18:30.528
PHARMACIES. THE INABILITY OF

04:18:30.595 --> 04:18:32.263
OUR CONSTITUENTS TO BE ABLE TO

04:18:32.330 --> 04:18:34.198
GET THE CARE AND MEDICATION

04:18:34.265 --> 04:18:35.132
THAT THEY NEED, BECAUSE THEY

04:18:35.199 --> 04:18:38.536
ARE BEING FORCED INTO HAVING TO

04:18:38.603 --> 04:18:40.004
PAY SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED

04:18:40.071 --> 04:18:43.174
COSTS AS A RESULT OF PBMS,

04:18:43.241 --> 04:18:44.976
WHICH LARGELY STAND UNREGULATED.

04:18:45.042 --> 04:18:47.511
IT IS THE WILD WEST OUT THERE

04:18:47.578 --> 04:18:48.412
WHEN IT COMES TO PRESCRIPTION

04:18:48.479 --> 04:18:49.213
DRUG USE, AND PRESCRIPTION

04:18:49.280 --> 04:18:52.683
DRUGS ARE THE NUMBER ONE REASON

04:18:52.750 --> 04:18:54.986
WHY PEOPLE EXPERIENCE MEDICAL

04:18:55.052 --> 04:18:56.220
DEBT IN THIS STATE OF

04:18:56.287 --> 04:18:57.955

04:19:01.459 --> 04:19:03.094
ENVIRONMENT RIGHT NOW, I WANT

04:19:03.160 --> 04:19:04.695

THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. I RISE

IN OPPOSITION TO SB 660. NOT

04:43:24.420 --> 04:43:26.489
BECAUSE WE DISAGREE WITH THE

BUT REMEMBER, EVERY BILL WE

PASS PASS IN THIS CHAMBER HAS A

04:43:35.765 --> 04:43:38.034
COST, AND AT SOME POINT WE

04:43:38.101 --> 04:43:40.870
BREAK THE BACKS OF HEALTH CARE

04:43:40.937 --> 04:43:42.038
PROVIDERS OF HOSPITALS. THE

04:43:42.105 --> 04:43:44.207

04:43:51.147 --> 04:43:54.217
SITTING BACK. AND HE SAID THE

04:43:54.283 --> 04:43:56.419
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALLOWED A

04:43:56.486 --> 04:43:58.721

DIDN'T COME IN AND BAIL OUT.

04:44:05.294 --> 04:44:07.296

04:44:07.363 --> 04:44:08.431
FINANCIAL PROBLEMS IN THE FIRST

04:44:08.498 --> 04:44:11.601
PLACE? COULD IT BE THAT WE HAVE

04:44:11.667 --> 04:44:12.235
A HIGH COST OF OPERATING? COULD

04:44:12.301 --> 04:44:14.070
IT BE THAT WE'VE ADDED

04:44:14.137 --> 04:44:15.238
REGULATIONS TO HOSPITALS? AGAIN,

04:44:15.304 --> 04:44:17.673
SOME OF THEM COULD BE VERY WELL

04:44:17.740 --> 04:44:19.375
INTENDED, BUT AT SOME POINT YOU

04:44:19.442 --> 04:44:21.677
BREAK THE BACK OF THE HEALTH

04:44:21.744 --> 04:44:24.414
CARE PROVIDERS. THE CALIFORNIA

04:44:24.480 --> 04:44:25.915

ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT THEY

05:02:26.127 --> 05:02:28.196
DESERVE. THEY ARE GIG WORKERS,

05:02:28.263 --> 05:02:29.264
BUT THEY DESERVE THE SAME

05:02:29.331 --> 05:02:32.033

MENLO PARK FOR THEIR INCREDIBLE

05:04:22.177 --> 05:04:24.245
WORK ON THIS. I HAVE A LOT OF

05:04:24.312 --> 05:04:26.181
BATTLE SCARS FROM WHEN I WAS

HUNDREDS, IF NOT THOUSANDS,

05:04:45.300 --> 05:04:47.502
I'VE MET OVER THE LAST SEVERAL

05:04:47.569 --> 05:04:48.336
YEARS. THEY'RE THE ONES THAT

05:04:48.403 --> 05:04:50.405
WE'RE FIGHTING FOR. THEY'RE THE

05:04:50.472 --> 05:04:52.440
ONES THAT WHOSE WORK AND

05:04:52.507 --> 05:04:53.508
ORGANIZATION HAS ALLOWED US TO

05:04:53.575 --> 05:04:56.011
COME TO THIS POINT. AND AGAIN,

05:04:56.077 --> 05:04:58.580

05:04:58.647 --> 05:05:00.448
THE BILL THAT HAVE ALSO WORKED

05:05:00.515 --> 05:05:04.586
TIRELESSLY OVER MANY YEARS, AND

05:05:04.653 --> 05:05:07.389
I URGE OUR COLLEAGUES TO VOTE

05:05:07.455 --> 05:05:09.124
FOR THIS. AND AGAIN, I WANT TO

05:05:09.190 --> 05:05:12.193
THANK THE AUTHORS FOR REALLY

05:05:12.260 --> 05:05:14.696
BEING ABLE TO THREAD THIS

05:05:14.763 --> 05:05:16.431
NEEDLE OVER A JOURNEY THAT'S

05:05:16.498 --> 05:05:18.066
TAKEN MANY YEARS RESPECTFULLY

05:05:18.133 --> 05:05:20.368
ASKED FOR, AND I VOTE. THANK

05:05:20.435 --> 05:05:21.236
YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER, ASSEMBLY

05:05:21.302 --> 05:05:23.338
MEMBER DEMAIO, YOU ARE

05:05:23.405 --> 05:05:24.472
RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MR.

05:05:24.539 --> 05:05:26.408
SPEAKER. I RISE IN OPPOSITION

05:05:26.474 --> 05:05:33.381
TO AB 1340. WHEN WE LOOK AT

05:05:33.448 --> 05:05:35.283
THESE BILLS, WE HAVE WE HAVE TO

05:05:35.350 --> 05:05:37.018
ASK OURSELVES, IS IT GOOD FOR

05:05:37.085 --> 05:05:40.855
THE EMPLOYEE? IS IT GOOD FOR

05:05:40.922 --> 05:05:43.124
THE CONSUMER? IF THE ANSWER TO

05:05:43.191 --> 05:05:44.893
EITHER OF THESE QUESTIONS IS NO,

05:05:44.959 --> 05:05:48.196
WE HAVE TO WEIGH AND BALANCE.

05:05:48.263 --> 05:05:50.732
IF THE ANSWER TO BOTH OF THESE

05:05:50.799 --> 05:05:52.967
QUESTIONS IS NO, WE SHOULD

05:05:53.034 --> 05:05:58.707
REJECT THE BILL. IT HAS BEEN

05:05:58.773 --> 05:06:02.544
SAID THAT ORGANIZED LABOR

05:06:02.610 --> 05:06:04.112
CONTROLS THIS BUILDING, AND I

05:06:04.179 --> 05:06:06.347
WOULD SAY THAT FOR THOSE THAT

05:06:06.414 --> 05:06:10.218
SAY THAT THIS BILL WOULD BE

05:06:10.285 --> 05:06:13.655
PRETTY GOOD EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT

05:06:13.722 --> 05:06:16.991
THAT VIEW. ORGANIZED LABOR

05:06:17.058 --> 05:06:19.527
WANTS TO USE THE POWER OF

05:06:19.594 --> 05:06:21.029
GOVERNMENT TO COMPEL PEOPLE

05:06:21.096 --> 05:06:24.265
INTO THEIR RANKS SO THAT THEY

05:06:24.332 --> 05:06:26.334
CAN START TAKING MONEY OUT OF

05:06:26.401 --> 05:06:28.369
THEIR PAYCHECKS. THAT MONEY

05:06:28.436 --> 05:06:31.339
THEN COMES BACK UP HERE TO THIS

05:06:31.406 --> 05:06:33.508
BUILDING IN THE FORM OF

05:06:33.575 --> 05:06:36.444
CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS. THAT IS

05:06:36.511 --> 05:06:40.148
THE PERFECT DEFINITION OF A

05:06:40.215 --> 05:06:43.485
SWAMP. IT'S NOT ABOUT THE

05:06:43.551 --> 05:06:45.487
CONSUMER. IT'S NOT ABOUT THE

05:06:45.553 --> 05:06:47.956
WORKER. IT'S ABOUT THE POWERFUL.

05:06:48.022 --> 05:06:50.892
IT'S ABOUT WHAT'S IN IT FOR THE

05:06:50.959 --> 05:06:56.297
POLITICIAN. IN THIS BILL. WE'RE

05:06:56.364 --> 05:06:59.100
NOT GOING TO SEE WORKERS,

05:06:59.167 --> 05:07:02.003
DRIVERS GET BETTER BENEFITS. WE

05:07:02.070 --> 05:07:04.272
WILL SEE UNION COFFERS SWELL.

05:07:04.339 --> 05:07:06.508
WE WILL SEE CAMPAIGN

05:07:06.574 --> 05:07:07.609
CONTRIBUTIONS. THAT'S MY

05:07:07.675 --> 05:07:09.377
PREDICTION IF WE PASS THIS BILL,

05:07:09.444 --> 05:07:11.780
BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN IT IN SO

05:07:11.846 --> 05:07:13.281
MANY OTHER AREAS WHERE

05:07:13.348 --> 05:07:15.483
GOVERNMENT PUTS ITS THUMB ON

05:07:15.550 --> 05:07:18.319
THE SCALE TO FORCE PEOPLE INTO

05:07:18.386 --> 05:07:19.954
A LABOR UNION, WHETHER THEY

05:07:20.021 --> 05:07:22.323
LIKE IT OR NOT. THIS BILL

05:07:22.390 --> 05:07:24.325
PROVIDES NO ABILITY FOR A

05:07:24.392 --> 05:07:26.194
DRIVER TO SAY, OKAY, I DON'T

05:07:26.261 --> 05:07:28.263
WANT TO BE PART OF THIS. ONCE

05:07:28.329 --> 05:07:30.632
UNIONIZED, THEY'RE FORCED INTO

05:07:30.698 --> 05:07:32.600
THE CLUB, THEIR PAYCHECK

05:07:32.667 --> 05:07:35.303
DEBITED. AND SURE, WE KNOW THAT

05:07:35.370 --> 05:07:37.305
IN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE WALK OF

05:07:37.372 --> 05:07:39.140
LIFE, I CAN'T EVEN THINK OF ONE

05:07:39.207 --> 05:07:40.575
EXAMPLE WHERE A COMPANY HAS

05:07:40.642 --> 05:07:41.609
GONE UNION, WHERE GOVERNMENT

05:07:41.676 --> 05:07:43.244
HAS GONE, UNION AND COSTS. THE

05:07:43.311 --> 05:07:45.713
CONSUMER HAS GONE DOWN. I CAN

05:07:45.780 --> 05:07:47.582
THINK OF ZERO EXAMPLES. IF

05:07:47.649 --> 05:07:49.350
THERE ARE EXAMPLES, PLEASE LET

05:07:49.417 --> 05:07:52.020
ME KNOW. SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING

05:07:52.086 --> 05:07:53.288
WITH THIS BILL IS NOT ONLY ARE

05:07:53.354 --> 05:07:55.223
WE NOT GOING TO HELP THE

05:07:55.290 --> 05:07:58.560
WORKERS, BUT PEOPLE WHO RELY ON

05:07:58.626 --> 05:07:59.561
THESE APP BASED TRANSPORTATION

05:07:59.627 --> 05:08:02.797
SERVICES, SENIORS THAT NEED TO

05:08:02.864 --> 05:08:05.166
ORDER FOOD, PERHAPS THEIR COSTS

05:08:05.233 --> 05:08:08.403
ARE GOING TO GO HIGHER. Þ BUT

05:08:08.469 --> 05:08:10.104
THE POWERFUL, THEY GET THE

05:08:10.171 --> 05:08:19.414
BENEFIT. THIS BILL EPITOMIZES

05:08:19.480 --> 05:08:22.283
WHY SACRAMENTO IS BROKEN, WHY

05:08:22.350 --> 05:08:25.153
THE INFLUENTIAL BENEFIT AS

05:08:25.220 --> 05:08:27.322
CONSUMERS AND EMPLOYEES HAVE

05:08:27.388 --> 05:08:30.692
THEIR LOT DIMINISHED. I URGE

05:08:30.758 --> 05:08:34.495
YOU TO VOTE NO. THANK YOU.

05:08:34.562 --> 05:08:35.363
ASSEMBLY MEMBER DEMAIO.

05:08:41.436 --> 05:08:45.707
AB 1340, AS WAS REFERENCED

05:08:45.773 --> 05:08:48.209
BEFOREHAND. IT'S NOT EVERY DAY

05:08:48.276 --> 05:08:50.044
THAT WE CAN COME TOGETHER AND

05:08:50.111 --> 05:08:53.548
FIND SOLUTIONS TO IMPORTANT

05:08:53.615 --> 05:08:55.617
PIECES OF LABOR PROTECTIONS,

05:08:55.683 --> 05:08:57.185
BECAUSE WE SHARE OUR VALUES

05:08:57.252 --> 05:09:01.155
WITH THEM. BUT THIS BILL IS A

05:09:01.222 --> 05:09:03.324
NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT WITH

05:09:03.391 --> 05:09:05.226
STAKEHOLDERS. AND TO BE VERY

05:09:05.293 --> 05:09:07.028
CLEAR AND WITH DUE RESPECT TO

05:09:07.095 --> 05:09:09.097
MY COLLEAGUE FROM SOUTHERN

05:09:09.163 --> 05:09:10.031
CALIFORNIA, NOBODY OWNS ME OR

05:09:10.098 --> 05:09:12.066
ANYONE IN THIS BUILDING. WE DO

05:09:12.133 --> 05:09:14.168
IT BECAUSE WE FEEL WITH THE

05:09:14.235 --> 05:09:15.270
COURAGE OF OUR CONVICTION AND

05:09:15.336 --> 05:09:16.905
OUR VALUES, NOT BECAUSE OF

05:09:16.971 --> 05:09:18.473
CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS. NOBODY

05:09:18.539 --> 05:09:21.409
OWNS US. WE SPEAK ON BEHALF OF

05:09:21.476 --> 05:09:22.176
OUR CONSTITUENTS, AND I URGE

05:09:22.243 --> 05:09:24.979
YOU TO VOTE AYE ON AB 1340.

05:09:25.046 --> 05:09:26.414
THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

05:09:26.481 --> 05:09:28.016

PATTERSON, YOU'RE RECOGNIZED.

05:09:28.683 --> 05:09:30.752
WELL, GREAT. THANK YOU, MR.

05:09:30.818 --> 05:09:33.421
SPEAKER. YOU KNOW, A YEAR AGO,

05:09:33.488 --> 05:09:35.223
TWO YEARS AGO, I SUPPORTED A

05:09:35.290 --> 05:09:37.158
BILL TO ALLOW OUR EMPLOYEES

05:09:37.225 --> 05:09:39.460
HERE IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE

05:09:39.527 --> 05:09:41.562
LEGISLATURE TO UNIONIZE.

05:09:41.629 --> 05:09:43.064
GENERALLY SPEAKING, I THINK

05:09:43.131 --> 05:09:45.500
PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO

05:09:45.566 --> 05:09:46.134
ASSOCIATION. INTERESTINGLY

05:09:46.200 --> 05:09:50.071
ENOUGH, THAT BILL DIDN'T

05:09:50.138 --> 05:09:52.106
CONTAIN MANY OF THE PROVISIONS

05:09:52.173 --> 05:09:55.310
IN THIS BILL. FOR EXAMPLE, THIS

05:09:55.376 --> 05:09:58.012
NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT REQUIRES

05:09:58.079 --> 05:10:00.848
THE THE TRANSPORTATION NETWORK

05:10:00.915 --> 05:10:03.017
COMPANIES TO NOTIFY EMPLOYEES

05:10:03.084 --> 05:10:05.053
OF THEIR RIGHTS EVERY 30 DAYS.

05:10:05.119 --> 05:10:07.055
VERY CURIOUS ABOUT WHY THE

05:10:07.121 --> 05:10:08.256
LEGISLATURE WOULDN'T BE

05:10:08.323 --> 05:10:10.258
REQUIRED TO NOTIFY LEGISLATIVE

05:10:10.325 --> 05:10:12.160
EMPLOYEES OF THEIR RIGHTS EVERY

05:10:12.226 --> 05:10:14.495
30 DAYS. MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE

05:10:14.562 --> 05:10:16.464
THIS BODY DOESN'T WANT THEIR

05:10:16.531 --> 05:10:17.365
EMPLOYEES TO KNOW WHAT THEIR

05:10:17.432 --> 05:10:19.000
RIGHTS ARE EVERY 30 DAYS. SO I

05:10:19.067 --> 05:10:21.135
SAY, WHY DON'T WE APPLY THE

05:10:21.202 --> 05:10:23.538
SAME STANDARD TO THAT? SO,

05:10:23.604 --> 05:10:25.173
GIVEN THE INCONSISTENCY, I'VE

05:10:25.239 --> 05:10:27.575
SUPPORTED BILLS LIKE THIS IN

05:10:27.642 --> 05:10:28.076
THE PAST, BUT GIVEN THE

05:10:28.142 --> 05:10:29.510
INCONSISTENCY WHERE WE HAVE

05:10:29.577 --> 05:10:30.378
DIFFERENT RULES FOR PEOPLE OUT

05:10:30.445 --> 05:10:32.914
IN THE WILD, BUT NOT HERE IN

05:10:32.981 --> 05:10:34.248
OUR OWN BUILDING, I

05:10:34.315 --> 05:10:36.351
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE.

05:10:36.417 --> 05:10:37.986
THANK YOU. SO MAYBE MEMBER

05:10:38.052 --> 05:10:39.320
PATTERSON, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

05:10:39.387 --> 05:10:40.355
HANEY, YOU ARE RECOGNIZED

05:10:40.421 --> 05:10:42.190
ASSEMBLY MEMBER HANEY, YOU ARE

05:10:42.256 --> 05:10:44.525
RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MR.

05:10:44.592 --> 05:10:45.927
SPEAKER. MEMBERS, I RISE IN

05:10:45.994 --> 05:10:48.129
SUPPORT OF AB 1340. I WANT TO

05:10:48.196 --> 05:10:49.397
THANK MY COLLEAGUES FROM

05:10:49.464 --> 05:10:51.632
OAKLAND AND MENLO PARK. I

05:10:51.699 --> 05:10:53.267
REPRESENT MANY OF THESE

05:10:53.334 --> 05:10:55.570
COMPANIES WHOSE EMPLOYEES WILL

05:10:55.636 --> 05:10:58.072
BE AFFECTED BY THIS BILL,

05:10:58.139 --> 05:11:00.641
INCLUDING BOTH LYFT AND UBER.

05:11:00.708 --> 05:11:02.477
THEY ARE BOTH HEADQUARTERED IN

05:11:02.543 --> 05:11:03.911
ASSEMBLY DISTRICT 17, AND I

05:11:03.978 --> 05:11:07.115
THINK THIS COULD NOT BE MORE

05:11:07.181 --> 05:11:08.049
IMPORTANT FOR OUR STATE TO MAKE

05:11:08.116 --> 05:11:11.452
SURE THAT THE OVER 1.5 MILLION

05:11:11.519 --> 05:11:15.123
CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE WORKED AS

05:11:15.189 --> 05:11:17.959
A DRIVER OR DELIVERY WORKER FOR

05:11:18.026 --> 05:11:20.161
ONE OF THESE APPS HAVE THE

05:11:20.228 --> 05:11:22.296
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE COLLECTIVE

05:11:22.363 --> 05:11:24.132
REPRESENTATION. THIS IS NOT

05:11:24.198 --> 05:11:26.401
JUST ABOUT WHETHER THESE FOLKS

05:11:26.467 --> 05:11:28.002
HAVE A UNION, IT'S ABOUT

05:11:28.069 --> 05:11:29.704
WHETHER THEY HAVE FAIR PAY AND

05:11:29.771 --> 05:11:32.006
BENEFITS AND A VOICE AT THE

05:11:32.073 --> 05:11:33.307
WORKPLACE THAT MAKES CALIFORNIA

05:11:33.374 --> 05:11:34.809
BETTER, THAT MAKES CALIFORNIA

05:11:34.876 --> 05:11:36.477
STRONGER. ALL OF THESE FOLKS

05:11:36.544 --> 05:11:38.179
ARE IN OUR DISTRICT. THEY

05:11:38.246 --> 05:11:39.914
DESERVE THE RIGHT TO BE

05:11:39.981 --> 05:11:41.516
REPRESENTED SO THAT THEY CAN

05:11:41.582 --> 05:11:42.383
TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES,

05:11:42.450 --> 05:11:44.285
AND THAT THESE COMPANIES ALSO

05:11:44.352 --> 05:11:47.088
CAN BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE WITH A

05:11:47.155 --> 05:11:49.757
COLLECTIVE VOICE SO THAT WHEN

05:11:49.824 --> 05:11:50.558
ISSUES AT THE WORKPLACE

05:11:50.625 --> 05:11:52.260
WORKPLACE COME UP, THAT THEY

05:11:52.326 --> 05:11:53.428
HAVE FOLKS TO WORK WITH, IT

05:11:53.494 --> 05:11:54.295
WILL MAKE THESE COMPANIES

05:11:54.362 --> 05:11:56.097
STRONGER. IT WILL MAKE THESE

05:11:56.164 --> 05:11:57.465
WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES

05:11:57.532 --> 05:11:58.399
STRONGER, AND IT WILL MAKE

05:11:58.466 --> 05:11:59.100
CALIFORNIA STRONGER. I

05:11:59.167 --> 05:12:00.168
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE

05:12:00.234 --> 05:12:02.336
VOTE. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

05:12:02.403 --> 05:12:03.304
MEMBER HANEY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

05:12:03.371 --> 05:12:06.874
BRIAN, YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

05:12:06.941 --> 05:12:08.142
THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. AND

05:12:08.209 --> 05:12:10.244
COLLEAGUES, I DID NOT PLAN ON

05:12:10.311 --> 05:12:11.512
SPEAKING ON THIS BILL, BUT IT'S

05:12:11.579 --> 05:12:12.246
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT, AND I

05:12:12.313 --> 05:12:14.115
WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM

05:12:14.182 --> 05:12:15.550
OAKLAND AND MENLO PARK FOR

05:12:15.616 --> 05:12:17.318
DOING THIS NECESSARY WORK. AS

05:12:17.385 --> 05:12:18.786
MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO

05:12:18.853 --> 05:12:20.321
SAID, MAKING SURE THAT 1.5

05:12:20.388 --> 05:12:22.256
MILLION CALIFORNIANS KNOW THEIR

05:12:22.323 --> 05:12:24.592
RIGHTS, THEIR RIGHTS TO

05:12:24.659 --> 05:12:25.726
ORGANIZE AND HAVE THOSE RIGHTS

05:12:25.793 --> 05:12:28.863
AFFIRMED IS OUR JOB IS A CORE

05:12:28.930 --> 05:12:29.931
RESPONSIBILITY. IT'S NOT PART

05:12:29.997 --> 05:12:32.100
OF SOME SORT OF FEEDBACK LOOP.

05:12:32.166 --> 05:12:33.935
AND I RESENT THAT WHEN ONLY ONE

05:12:34.001 --> 05:12:35.203
MEMBER OF THIS BODY HAS EVER

05:12:35.269 --> 05:12:37.171
BEEN ADMONISHED ALL SESSION

05:12:37.238 --> 05:12:38.339
LONG FOR CAMPAIGNING ON THE

05:12:38.406 --> 05:12:41.242
ASSEMBLY FLOOR, AND IT IS NOT

05:12:41.309 --> 05:12:42.977
ANYBODY WHO'S FIGHTING FOR THIS

05:12:43.044 --> 05:12:45.480
BILL. THIS ISN'T ABOUT THE

05:12:45.546 --> 05:12:46.747
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE

05:12:46.814 --> 05:12:48.349
DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS WHO CAME

05:12:48.416 --> 05:12:51.285
TOGETHER TO NEGOTIATE THIS. IT

05:12:51.352 --> 05:12:53.988
IS ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

05:12:54.055 --> 05:12:56.424
IMPACTED. MY FAVORITE THING

05:12:56.491 --> 05:12:58.092
THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN

05:12:58.159 --> 05:12:59.393
DIEGO SAID IN HIS FLIPPANT

05:12:59.460 --> 05:13:01.963
REMARKS IS THAT HE CALLED THEM

05:13:02.029 --> 05:13:03.297
WORKERS. SEE, THAT WAS ANOTHER

05:13:03.364 --> 05:13:04.899
FIGHT THAT TOOK MANY YEARS TO

05:13:04.966 --> 05:13:08.102
GET THEM SEEN AS WORKERS,

05:13:08.169 --> 05:13:11.806
EMPLOYEES, FOLKS WHOSE LABOR IS

05:13:11.873 --> 05:13:12.607
BEING EXPLOITED

05:13:12.673 --> 05:13:14.242
DISPROPORTIONATELY ON BEHALF OF

05:13:14.308 --> 05:13:16.010
THESE COMPANIES BECAUSE THE

05:13:16.077 --> 05:13:18.446
INNOVATION HAS OUTPACED LABOR

05:13:18.513 --> 05:13:21.015
STANDARDS, HAS OUTPACED UNION

05:13:21.082 --> 05:13:23.217
REPRESENTATION, AND THEY'VE

05:13:23.284 --> 05:13:25.019
DESERVED FAR BETTER FOR FAR

05:13:25.086 --> 05:13:26.954
LONGER THAN JUST THIS MOMENT.

05:13:27.021 --> 05:13:29.023
THIS IS OVERDUE. THIS IS LATE.

05:13:29.090 --> 05:13:31.125
BUT I'M GLAD THAT CALIFORNIA IS

05:13:31.192 --> 05:13:32.059
STEPPING UP TO THIS FIGHT AND

05:13:32.126 --> 05:13:34.762
LEADING THE WAY. AND I WANT TO

05:13:34.829 --> 05:13:35.363
THANK MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE

05:13:35.429 --> 05:13:37.498
BEEN SO CRITICAL IN GETTING US

05:13:37.565 --> 05:13:37.932
TO THIS POINT. AND I

05:13:37.999 --> 05:13:39.200
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

05:13:39.267 --> 05:13:40.468
THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

05:13:40.535 --> 05:13:41.802
BRIAN, ASSEMBLY MEMBER SORIA,

05:13:41.869 --> 05:13:42.970
YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU,

05:13:43.037 --> 05:13:44.272
MR. SPEAKER. I ALSO WASN'T

05:13:44.338 --> 05:13:46.541
PLANNING TO SPEAK ON THIS BILL,

05:13:46.607 --> 05:13:48.109
BUT I DO WANT TO THANK THE

05:13:48.176 --> 05:13:49.410
AUTHOR AND ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS

05:13:49.477 --> 05:13:50.912
THAT CAME TOGETHER. AND I WAS

05:13:50.978 --> 05:13:52.547
JUST REMINDED ON SATURDAY WHEN

05:13:52.613 --> 05:13:54.916
I TOOK AN UBER RIDE AND IT WAS

05:13:54.982 --> 05:13:57.084
SARAH THAT TOOK ME ABOUT 30

05:13:57.151 --> 05:13:59.287
MILES TO WHERE I NEEDED TO BE,

05:13:59.353 --> 05:14:01.022
AND I TOLD HER ABOUT WHAT WAS

05:14:01.088 --> 05:14:02.190
HAPPENING ACTUALLY THIS WEEK.

05:14:02.256 --> 05:14:04.358
AND WHAT SHE TOLD ME WAS THAT

05:14:04.425 --> 05:14:06.027
SHE WANTED ME TO SUPPORT IT

05:14:06.093 --> 05:14:08.329
BECAUSE SHE HAS EIGHT KIDS AND

05:14:08.396 --> 05:14:12.200
THIS IS HER ONLY JOB, AND IT

05:14:12.266 --> 05:14:14.235
HAS ALLOWED HER THE FLEXIBILITY.

05:14:14.302 --> 05:14:16.237
AND SO WHEN I THINK ABOUT 1340,

05:14:16.304 --> 05:14:18.005
I THINK ABOUT SARAH AND ALL THE

05:14:18.072 --> 05:14:20.174
SARAH'S IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT

05:14:20.241 --> 05:14:21.375
ARE JUST TRYING TO MAKE ENDS

05:14:21.442 --> 05:14:24.445
MEET. AND THEN I KNOW THAT THIS

05:14:24.512 --> 05:14:25.146
DEAL WILL ALLOW HER THE

05:14:25.213 --> 05:14:26.747
OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO

05:14:26.814 --> 05:14:29.217
PROVIDE FOR HER KIDS. AND JUST

05:14:29.283 --> 05:14:30.952
TO RESPOND TO MY COLLEAGUE THAT

05:14:31.018 --> 05:14:32.086
SAID, YOU KNOW, THIS BILL IS

05:14:32.153 --> 05:14:34.088
VERY DIFFERENT FROM A FROM AB

05:14:34.155 --> 05:14:35.389
ONE, WHICH MANY OF US ON THIS

05:14:35.456 --> 05:14:37.091
FLOOR SUPPORTED, AND I SUPPORT

05:14:37.158 --> 05:14:39.227
IT. AND I THINK ABOUT THE

05:14:39.293 --> 05:14:40.928
DIFFERENCES. IT'S NOT APPLES TO

05:14:40.995 --> 05:14:42.396
APPLES WHEN WE THINK ABOUT

05:14:42.463 --> 05:14:44.165
THESE DRIVERS. ACTUALLY THESE

05:14:44.232 --> 05:14:45.967
DRIVERS COME IN AND OUT. FOR

05:14:46.033 --> 05:14:47.301
SOME OF THEM, IT'S A PART TIME

05:14:47.368 --> 05:14:49.136
GIG. FOR SOME OF THEM, THEY

05:14:49.203 --> 05:14:51.005
JUST NEED IT FOR THREE MONTHS

05:14:51.072 --> 05:14:52.240
WHERE THEY NEED TO MAKE A

05:14:52.306 --> 05:14:54.242
LITTLE BIT MORE MONEY. AND I

05:14:54.308 --> 05:14:55.042
THINK THAT'S WHY THE

05:14:55.109 --> 05:14:56.277
REQUIREMENTS ARE A LITTLE BIT

05:14:56.344 --> 05:14:57.945
DIFFERENT. AND SO TODAY I STAND

05:14:58.012 --> 05:15:00.314
VERY PROUD IN SUPPORT OF AB

05:15:00.381 --> 05:15:01.983
1340. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

05:15:02.049 --> 05:15:04.018
MEMBER SORIA SEEING AND HEARING

05:15:04.085 --> 05:15:05.620
NO FURTHER DEBATE. ASSEMBLY

05:15:05.686 --> 05:15:07.321
MEMBER WIX DO YOU WISH TO CLOSE?

05:15:07.388 --> 05:15:08.055
THANK YOU. THANK YOU, MADAM

05:15:08.122 --> 05:15:09.523
SPEAKER AND MEMBERS, AND FOR

05:15:09.590 --> 05:15:10.725
THE CONVERSATION FROM ALL OF

05:15:10.791 --> 05:15:12.326
OUR COLLEAGUES. YOU KNOW, I

05:15:12.393 --> 05:15:13.294
VIEW MYSELF AS SOMEONE WHO'S

05:15:13.361 --> 05:15:14.795
WHO'S PRETTY INDEPENDENTLY

05:15:14.862 --> 05:15:17.298
MINDED. I'M NOT A SHILL FOR

05:15:17.365 --> 05:15:19.233
ANYONE, AND I'VE WORKED CLOSELY

05:15:19.300 --> 05:15:20.167
WITH BUSINESS, AND I'VE FOUGHT

05:15:20.234 --> 05:15:21.235
BUSINESS, AND I'VE WORKED

05:15:21.302 --> 05:15:23.070
CLOSELY WITH LABOR, AND I'VE

05:15:23.137 --> 05:15:24.305
FOUGHT LABOR. THOSE OF YOU THAT

05:15:24.372 --> 05:15:26.474
KNOW SOME OF ME IN THE HOUSING

05:15:26.540 --> 05:15:27.141
FIGHTS, LIKE THOSE ARE

05:15:27.208 --> 05:15:27.708
UNCOMFORTABLE CONVERSATIONS,

05:15:27.775 --> 05:15:29.277
BUT ONES THAT WERE WILLING TO

05:15:29.343 --> 05:15:31.379
HAVE BECAUSE WE GOT TO CALL THE

05:15:31.445 --> 05:15:32.179
BALLS AND STRIKES. AND THAT'S

05:15:32.246 --> 05:15:34.248
WHAT THE JOB IS ABOUT. AND WHAT

05:15:34.315 --> 05:15:35.149
I THINK ABOUT THIS BILL, THIS

05:15:35.216 --> 05:15:38.252
IS A HOME RUN. IT'S A HOME RUN

05:15:38.319 --> 05:15:39.987
BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO SAVE OUR

05:15:40.054 --> 05:15:42.590
CONSUMERS, OUR CONSTITUENTS, IN

05:15:42.657 --> 05:15:44.025
TERMS OF THEIR COST OF FARES.

05:15:44.091 --> 05:15:46.160
IT'S GOING TO HELP OUR WORKERS

05:15:46.227 --> 05:15:47.962
TO HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE.

05:15:48.029 --> 05:15:49.463
AND YES, IT'S UNIQUE. IT'S

05:15:49.530 --> 05:15:50.298
UNIQUE BECAUSE OF PROP 22. WE

05:15:50.364 --> 05:15:52.667
HAVE TO DO THIS BILL TO ALLOW

05:15:52.733 --> 05:15:54.035
FOR A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

05:15:54.101 --> 05:15:56.237
AGREEMENT TO EXIST. SO THAT IS

05:15:56.304 --> 05:15:57.972
WHY THIS IS UNIQUE. AND I WILL

05:15:58.039 --> 05:16:00.274
SAY THIS IS BUSINESS AND LABOR

05:16:00.341 --> 05:16:01.442
COMING TOGETHER TO SOLVE A

05:16:01.509 --> 05:16:03.244
PROBLEM. AND THAT IS ACTUALLY

05:16:03.311 --> 05:16:05.179
OUR JOB IS SOLVING PROBLEMS,

05:16:05.246 --> 05:16:06.981
NOT POLITICAL RHETORIC AND BOMB

05:16:07.048 --> 05:16:08.282
THROWING. THAT'S NOT WHAT OUR

05:16:08.349 --> 05:16:09.383
CONSTITUENTS WANT. THEY WANT

05:16:09.450 --> 05:16:12.420
THE PROBLEMS FIXED. SO I

05:16:12.486 --> 05:16:13.120
WELCOME COLLEAGUES FROM THE

05:16:13.187 --> 05:16:14.455
OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE TO COME

05:16:14.522 --> 05:16:17.091
BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION. COME

05:16:17.158 --> 05:16:19.560
WORK WITH LABOR AND BUSINESS TO

05:16:19.627 --> 05:16:20.127
ACTUALLY SOLVE PROBLEMS THAT

LOCAL MUNICIPAL LOCKUP OR IN A

06:00:04.749 --> 06:00:06.384
COUNTY JAIL, THERE IS NO SUCH

06:00:06.451 --> 06:00:09.554
REQUIREMENT. THIS WAS FOUND OUT

06:00:09.621 --> 06:00:10.989
BY THE FAMILY OF WAKISHA WILSON

06:00:11.056 --> 06:00:14.859
NEARLY A DECADE AGO IN THE LAPD

06:00:14.926 --> 06:00:16.494
HOLDING CELL, WHERE SHE PASSED

06:00:16.561 --> 06:00:18.330
AWAY, AND HER FAMILY DID NOT

06:00:18.396 --> 06:00:21.066
KNOW UNTIL THEY APPEARED FOR

06:00:21.132 --> 06:00:22.300
HER COURT HEARING FOUR DAYS

06:00:22.367 --> 06:00:24.169
LATER. AND WHEN THEY SHOWED UP

06:00:24.235 --> 06:00:27.172
TO THAT COURTROOM, WAKISHA HAD

06:00:27.238 --> 06:00:29.007
ZEROS NEXT TO HER NAME AND WAS

06:00:29.074 --> 06:00:31.343
NOT IN THE ROOM. AND EVEN THEN

06:00:31.409 --> 06:00:34.045
THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENED.

06:00:34.112 --> 06:00:36.648
THEY WERE TOLD THAT SHE FAILED

06:00:36.715 --> 06:00:37.682
TO APPEAR DESPITE BEING IN

06:00:37.749 --> 06:00:39.250
CUSTODY. AFTER MAKING MANY

06:00:39.317 --> 06:00:41.453
PHONE CALLS THEMSELVES, THEY

06:00:41.519 --> 06:00:42.053
WERE EVENTUALLY REDIRECTED TO

06:00:42.120 --> 06:00:44.522
THE CORONER'S OFFICE. THIS

06:00:44.589 --> 06:00:46.992
MOTHER CALLED THE CORONER TO

06:00:47.058 --> 06:00:48.693
FIND OUT THAT HER DAUGHTER HAD

06:00:48.760 --> 06:00:50.028
PASSED AWAY IN CUSTODY OVER

06:00:50.095 --> 06:00:53.298
FOUR DAYS PRIOR. IT SHOULDN'T

06:00:53.365 --> 06:00:54.899
BE LIKE THIS. IT DOESN'T HAVE

06:00:54.966 --> 06:00:57.602
TO BE LIKE THIS. IF THE STATE

06:00:57.669 --> 06:00:58.436
HAS A STANDARD FOR PRISONS,

06:00:58.503 --> 06:01:00.405
THAT STANDARD CAN BE APPLIED TO

06:01:00.472 --> 06:01:02.173
ALL CUSTODY SETTINGS. THE

06:01:02.240 --> 06:01:04.042
CHANGES IN THE SENATE WERE TO

06:01:04.109 --> 06:01:06.478
PUT AN URGENCY CLAUSE ON THIS

06:01:06.544 --> 06:01:07.779
BILL, BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT

06:01:07.846 --> 06:01:09.314
NOTIFYING A FAMILY WHEN

06:01:09.381 --> 06:01:11.149
SOMEBODY HAS DIED IN CUSTODY IS

06:01:11.216 --> 06:01:12.984
A SHARED BIPARTISAN VALUE. AND

06:01:13.051 --> 06:01:15.320
WHEN THE GOVERNOR SIGNS THIS

06:01:15.387 --> 06:01:17.288
PIECE OF LEGISLATION, IT IS A

06:01:17.355 --> 06:01:19.024
SYMBOL FOR WAKISHA AND HER

06:01:19.090 --> 06:01:21.893
FAMILY AND APTLY NAMED

06:01:21.960 --> 06:01:22.527
WAUKESHA'S LAW. I RESPECTFULLY

06:01:22.594 --> 06:01:26.531

YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I THINK

06:01:48.420 --> 06:01:52.123
THIS IS JUST A MATTER OF COMMON

06:01:52.190 --> 06:01:54.025
COURTESY, RIGHT? IF SOMEONE

06:01:54.092 --> 06:01:57.262
SOMEONE DIES, IT'S I THINK IT'S

06:01:57.328 --> 06:02:00.098
IMPORTANT THAT WE IT'S IT'S NOT

06:02:00.165 --> 06:02:01.032
A PARTIZAN ISSUE. WE JUST

06:02:01.099 --> 06:02:03.034
COMMUNICATE TO THE FAMILIES AND

06:02:03.101 --> 06:02:04.335
LET THEM KNOW. WILL THIS CAUSE

06:02:04.402 --> 06:02:06.137
AN EXTRA STRAIN OR WHATEVER

06:02:06.204 --> 06:02:07.105
THAT MIGHT BE SURE. BUT THE

06:02:07.172 --> 06:02:09.140
REALITY IS IT'S ALREADY CAUSED

06:02:09.207 --> 06:02:11.276
AN EXTRA STRAIN ON THE THE

06:02:11.342 --> 06:02:12.177
DEATH OF A FAMILY. SO WITH THAT,

06:02:12.243 --> 06:02:16.681
I RISE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU,

06:02:16.748 --> 06:02:20.218

THAT THEY COULD PASS WAUKESHA'S

06:02:38.503 --> 06:02:40.038

BARRED ROVING PATROLS FROM

06:25:31.374 --> 06:25:33.009
SNATCHING PEOPLE OFF OUR

STREETS BASED ON HOW THEY LOOK,

06:25:35.312 --> 06:25:37.080

ESSENTIALLY, PEOPLE LIKE ME,

06:25:40.851 --> 06:25:43.053
PEOPLE THAT WORK ON JOBS THAT

06:25:43.119 --> 06:25:44.221

IMMIGRANTS DO. AND JUST BECAUSE

06:25:46.223 --> 06:25:49.292
WHERE THEY HAPPEN TO BE

06:25:49.359 --> 06:25:50.327
EFFECTIVELY ALLOWING FEDERAL

06:25:50.393 --> 06:25:52.295
AGENTS STOP SUSPECTS BASED

06:25:52.362 --> 06:25:55.465
SOLELY ON THEIR RACE, LANGUAGE

06:25:55.532 --> 06:25:57.801

06:25:57.868 --> 06:25:58.902
DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES

06:25:58.969 --> 06:26:00.170
EMPLOYED DURING THE TRUMP

06:26:00.237 --> 06:26:01.738
ADMINISTRATION'S IMMIGRATION

06:26:01.805 --> 06:26:05.375
RAIDS. THIS DECISION REPRESENTS

06:26:05.442 --> 06:26:06.476
A DANGEROUS EROSION OF THE

06:26:06.543 --> 06:26:08.545
CIVIL LIBERTIES THAT FORMED THE

06:26:08.612 --> 06:26:11.147
FOUNDATION OF OUR DEMOCRACY,

06:26:11.214 --> 06:26:13.650
AND SETS A DEEPLY TROUBLING

06:26:13.717 --> 06:26:16.853
PRECEDENT. RACIAL PROFILING HAS

06:26:16.920 --> 06:26:18.588
NO PLACE IN OUR SOCIETY, OUR

06:26:18.655 --> 06:26:21.758
LEGAL INSTITUTIONS, OR IN THE

06:26:21.825 --> 06:26:24.394
CONDUCT OF ANY GOVERNMENTAL

06:26:24.461 --> 06:26:27.330
AGENCY. SB 627 PROHIBITS LOCAL

06:26:27.397 --> 06:26:29.132
AND FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

06:26:29.199 --> 06:26:30.800
FROM COVERING THEIR FACES WHILE

06:26:30.867 --> 06:26:32.269
CONDUCTING OPERATIONS IN THE

06:26:32.335 --> 06:26:34.638
STATE OF CALIFORNIA, WITH

06:26:34.704 --> 06:26:35.972
NUMEROUS EXEMPTIONS SUCH AS

06:26:36.039 --> 06:26:38.909
CLEAR ON MEDICAL MASKS OR MASKS

06:26:38.975 --> 06:26:40.443
TO PROTECT AGAINST TOXINS, GAS

06:26:40.510 --> 06:26:44.381
OR SMOKE. I SEE SO IN TERROR IN

06:26:44.447 --> 06:26:46.416
OUR COMMUNITIES ACROSS

06:26:46.483 --> 06:26:48.318
CALIFORNIA, OFTEN WHILE MASKED

06:26:48.385 --> 06:26:50.220
IN THEIR INCREASINGLY LAWLESS

06:26:50.287 --> 06:26:52.522
BEHAVIOR, IS PUTTING LIVES AT

06:26:52.589 --> 06:26:56.226
RISK. IN ONE INSTANCE, MASK ICE

06:26:56.293 --> 06:26:57.160
AGENTS APPROACHED A LATINO MAN

06:26:57.227 --> 06:27:00.564
IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY. THEY

06:27:00.630 --> 06:27:01.965
DIDN'T SHOW IDENTIFICATION OR A

06:27:02.032 --> 06:27:04.167
WARRANT, AND THE TERRIFIED MAN

06:27:04.234 --> 06:27:07.070
DECIDED TO FLEE THE SCENE. ICE

06:27:07.137 --> 06:27:09.272
AGENTS THEN OPENED FIRE ON THE

06:27:09.339 --> 06:27:11.508
MAN AS HE DROVE AWAY, BREAKING

06:27:11.575 --> 06:27:12.609
HIS CAR'S WINDOWS AND

06:27:12.676 --> 06:27:14.911
ENDANGERING HIS LIFE. THESE

06:27:14.978 --> 06:27:17.514
AGENTS WERE MASKED. THEY WERE

06:27:17.581 --> 06:27:19.983
HIDING THEIR IDENTITY, HOW HE

06:27:20.050 --> 06:27:22.118
WAS SUPPOSED TO REASONABLY

06:27:22.185 --> 06:27:23.320
BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE LAW

06:27:23.386 --> 06:27:25.422
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND

06:27:25.488 --> 06:27:27.757
UNMASKED INDIVIDUALS TRYING TO

06:27:27.824 --> 06:27:29.025
KIDNAP YOU. IMAGINE THE

06:27:29.092 --> 06:27:31.161
ABSOLUTE FEAR OF BEING PULLED

06:27:31.227 --> 06:27:33.263
OVER AT GUNPOINT BY A GROUP OF

06:27:33.330 --> 06:27:34.431
MASKED INDIVIDUALS. ANYONE

06:27:34.497 --> 06:27:36.199
WOULD BE TERRIFIED. ANYONE

06:27:36.266 --> 06:27:37.334
WOULD QUESTION WHAT WAS

06:27:37.400 --> 06:27:41.171
HAPPENING. YET AGENCIES ARE

06:27:41.237 --> 06:27:42.138
PUSHING PEOPLE INTO TAKING MORE

06:27:42.205 --> 06:27:45.208
AND MORE RECKLESS RISKS. THESE

06:27:45.275 --> 06:27:47.277
MASKS DON'T JUST HIDE FACES,

06:27:47.344 --> 06:27:49.479
THEY ARE A THREAT TO PUBLIC

06:27:49.546 --> 06:27:50.947
SAFETY AND ESCALATE FEAR,

06:27:51.014 --> 06:27:53.450
MAKING THE SITUATION FAR MORE

06:27:53.516 --> 06:27:55.118
DANGEROUS FOR EVERYONE,

06:27:55.185 --> 06:27:56.386
INCLUDING THE VERY FEDERAL

06:27:56.453 --> 06:27:59.823
AGENTS WEARING THEM. ESTO NO ES

06:27:59.889 --> 06:28:00.824
UN RIESGO AMENAZA DE LA

06:28:00.890 --> 06:28:02.025
SEGURIDAD DE NUESTRAS

06:28:02.092 --> 06:28:04.961
COMUNIDADES. LAS COMUNIDADES

06:28:05.028 --> 06:28:06.429
QUÊ TODOS PRESENTAMOS. WHAT IS

06:28:06.496 --> 06:28:08.531
EVEN MORE CONCERNING IS THAT

06:28:08.598 --> 06:28:11.067
THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION IS

06:28:11.134 --> 06:28:12.202
URGING AND EVEN TRYING TO FORCE

06:28:12.268 --> 06:28:13.870
STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

06:28:13.937 --> 06:28:16.306
TO HELP ENFORCE IMMIGRATION

06:28:16.373 --> 06:28:18.341
LAWS. WE CANNOT ALLOW LAW

06:28:18.408 --> 06:28:20.076
ENFORCEMENT TO BE SWEPT UP IN

06:28:20.143 --> 06:28:22.545
THIS, AND WE MUST ENSURE THAT

06:28:22.612 --> 06:28:23.013
FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW

06:28:23.079 --> 06:28:24.414
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ARE NOT

06:28:24.481 --> 06:28:26.683

06:28:26.750 --> 06:28:28.351
WHILE PERFORMING THEIR

06:28:28.418 --> 06:28:30.086
RESPONSIBILITIES. IT IS OUR

06:28:30.153 --> 06:28:32.956
DUTY IN CALIFORNIA TO DEFEND A

06:28:33.023 --> 06:28:37.260
RULE OF LAW. IF WE WANT TO

06:28:37.327 --> 06:28:38.228
SUPPORT PUBLIC SAFETY, IF WE

06:28:38.294 --> 06:28:40.597
WANT THE PUBLIC TO TRUST LAW

06:28:40.664 --> 06:28:41.931
ENFORCEMENT, WE CANNOT ALLOW

06:28:41.998 --> 06:28:43.500
THEM TO BEHAVE LIKE SECRET

IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB 627,

06:32:11.507 --> 06:32:12.308
WHICH PROHIBITS LAW ENFORCEMENT

06:32:12.375 --> 06:32:14.077
FROM COVERING THEIR FACES WHILE

06:32:14.143 --> 06:32:16.913
INTERACTING WITH THE PUBLIC. SB

06:32:18.214 --> 06:32:20.650

CAUCUS TO PROTECT OUR DIVERSE

06:32:22.952 --> 06:32:24.020
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. THE USE

06:32:24.087 --> 06:32:26.122
OF FACE COVERINGS OR MASKS BY

TRANSPARENCY AND CONTRIBUTES TO

PROTECT OUR IMMIGRANT

06:32:40.803 --> 06:32:42.038
COMMUNITIES AND FAMILIES WHO

06:32:42.105 --> 06:32:43.239
HAVE BEEN TARGETED WITH

06:32:43.306 --> 06:32:44.407
AGGRESSIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT

06:32:44.474 --> 06:32:45.575
TACTICS IN RECENT FEDERAL

AND MEMBERS, I RISE IN STRONG

06:32:59.355 --> 06:33:03.226
SUPPORT OF SB 2627. WE'VE

06:33:03.293 --> 06:33:04.527
SPOKEN A LOT ABOUT WHAT'S

06:33:04.594 --> 06:33:07.931
HAPPENING IN OUR COMMUNITIES.

06:33:07.997 --> 06:33:11.134
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE REIGN OF

06:33:11.200 --> 06:33:14.304
TERROR THAT HAS COME DOWN ON

06:33:14.370 --> 06:33:16.139
MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO LOOKED

06:33:16.205 --> 06:33:20.243
LIKE MANY OF US. BUT WE NOW

06:33:20.310 --> 06:33:23.079
KNOW WHAT WE'VE THOUGHT ALL

06:33:23.146 --> 06:33:25.348
ALONG. THIS HAS NEVER BEEN

06:33:25.415 --> 06:33:26.950
ABOUT KEEPING OUR COMMUNITY

06:33:27.016 --> 06:33:31.721
SAFE, OR DEALING WITH PUBLIC OR

06:33:31.788 --> 06:33:34.824
DEALING WITH PUBLIC SAFETY. IN

06:33:34.891 --> 06:33:38.161
FACT, 70% OF THOSE WHO HAVE

06:33:38.227 --> 06:33:40.029
BEEN ARRESTED BY ICE DO NOT

06:33:40.096 --> 06:33:43.232
HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD YET. WE

06:33:43.299 --> 06:33:47.136
CONTINUE TO ALLOW UNMARKED,

06:33:47.203 --> 06:33:50.506
UNMARKED VEHICLES WITH MASKED

06:33:50.573 --> 06:33:54.310
MEN COMING INTO OUR COMMUNITIES

06:33:54.377 --> 06:33:57.914
AND KIDNAPING OUR DADS, OUR

06:33:57.981 --> 06:34:01.851

06:34:06.923 --> 06:34:10.193
WITHOUT OBJECTION. YESTERDAY,

06:34:10.259 --> 06:34:14.797
THE SUPREME COURT AND TRUMP'S

06:34:14.864 --> 06:34:20.970
APPOINTEES MADE A DECISION. AND

06:34:21.037 --> 06:34:23.339
ONE OF THOSE JUDGES THAT

06:34:23.406 --> 06:34:27.510
DISSENTED SAID WE SHOULD NOT

06:34:27.577 --> 06:34:30.380
HAVE TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE

06:34:30.446 --> 06:34:33.616
THE GOVERNMENT CAN SEIZE ANYONE

06:34:33.683 --> 06:34:36.652
WHO LOOKS LATINO, SPEAKS

06:34:36.719 --> 06:34:39.055
SPANISH AND APPEARS TO WORK A

06:34:39.122 --> 06:34:42.992
LOW WAGE JOB. JUSTICE SONIA

06:34:43.059 --> 06:34:44.327
SOTOMAYOR I RESPECTFULLY ASK

06:34:44.394 --> 06:34:48.097

ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS, YOU ARE

06:34:51.434 --> 06:34:55.004
RECOGNIZED. COLLEAGUES, I RISE

06:34:55.071 --> 06:34:58.041
TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL

06:34:58.107 --> 06:35:00.543
627. I WOULD LIKE TO COMMEND

06:35:00.610 --> 06:35:01.110
THE AUTHOR AND OTHER MEMBERS

06:35:01.177 --> 06:35:03.079
WHO HAVE TAKEN ACTION TO

06:35:03.146 --> 06:35:04.814
ADDRESS THE ESCALATION OF

06:35:04.881 --> 06:35:05.982
INHUMANE IMMIGRATION

06:35:06.049 --> 06:35:08.518
ENFORCEMENT IN OUR COMMUNITIES

06:35:08.584 --> 06:35:10.219
THIS JUNE, IN THE CITY OF

06:35:10.286 --> 06:35:12.288
PARAMOUNT ICE, THE FEDERAL

06:35:12.355 --> 06:35:13.923
AGENTS BEGAN TO STAGE DOWN THE

06:35:13.990 --> 06:35:16.426
STREET FROM OUR DISTRICT OFFICE.

06:35:16.492 --> 06:35:17.193
SINCE THE DEMONSTRATION OF

06:35:17.260 --> 06:35:19.095
FORCE, THE NATIONAL

06:35:19.162 --> 06:35:21.964
ADMINISTRATION HAS CONTINUED TO

06:35:22.031 --> 06:35:23.032
TARGET OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. MÁS

06:35:23.099 --> 06:35:25.068
FEDERAL AGENTS HAVE BEEN

06:35:25.134 --> 06:35:26.369
DEPLOYED WITHIN MY DISTRICT AND

06:35:26.436 --> 06:35:28.071
ACROSS THE STATE, CREATING FEAR

06:35:28.137 --> 06:35:31.207
AND CONFUSION. OUR COMMUNITIES

06:35:31.274 --> 06:35:33.543
CANNOT TELL IF THESE PEOPLE ARE

06:35:33.609 --> 06:35:35.244
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS OR

06:35:35.311 --> 06:35:37.046
SOMEONE ELSE INTENDING TO BE

06:35:37.113 --> 06:35:40.216
THEM TO HARM THEM. SB 627 IS

06:35:40.283 --> 06:35:42.051
ABOUT TRUST AND ACCOUNTABILITY.

06:35:42.118 --> 06:35:44.821
IT ENSURES THAT WHEN LAW

06:35:44.887 --> 06:35:45.388
ENFORCEMENT CARRIES OUT ITS

06:35:45.455 --> 06:35:46.589
DUTIES, THE PUBLIC THEY SERVE

06:35:46.656 --> 06:35:48.925
CAN IDENTIFY THEM. AT THE TIME

06:35:48.991 --> 06:35:52.528
THE BILL AT THIS TIME, THE BILL

06:35:52.595 --> 06:35:53.229
RESPECTS OFFICER SAFETY BY

06:35:53.296 --> 06:35:55.031
ALLOWING CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS FOR

06:35:55.098 --> 06:35:56.299
PROACTIVE, MASS UNDERCOVER AND

06:35:56.365 --> 06:35:58.901
SWAT OPERATIONS. IT SEEKS TO

06:35:58.968 --> 06:36:00.203
STRIKE THE BALANCE BETWEEN

06:36:00.269 --> 06:36:01.337
OFFICER SAFETY AND MAINTAINING

06:36:01.404 --> 06:36:03.306
TRUST WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. FOR

06:36:03.372 --> 06:36:05.374
COMMUNITIES IN MY DISTRICT AND

06:36:05.441 --> 06:36:07.176
ACROSS CALIFORNIA, THIS BILL

06:36:07.243 --> 06:36:08.044
MATTERS. THEY DESERVE TO KNOW

06:36:08.111 --> 06:36:10.179
WHO IS ENFORCING THE LAW, AND

06:36:10.246 --> 06:36:12.014
THEY DESERVE TO FEEL SECURE

06:36:12.081 --> 06:36:14.350
THAT NO ONE IS HIDING BEHIND A

06:36:14.417 --> 06:36:16.919
MASK TO CARRY OUT INTIMIDATION.

06:36:16.986 --> 06:36:19.288
COLLEAGUES, SB 627 DEFENDS THE

06:36:19.355 --> 06:36:21.324
YEARS OF EARNED TRUST AND OUR

06:36:21.390 --> 06:36:23.092
LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND TURNS

06:36:23.159 --> 06:36:24.293
PAINFUL MOMENTS IN MY DISTRICT

06:36:24.360 --> 06:36:26.062
AND ACROSS THE STATE INTO

06:36:26.129 --> 06:36:27.263
MEANINGFUL CHANGES FOR

06:36:27.330 --> 06:36:30.333
CALIFORNIA. YOU SEE, I HAVE

06:36:30.399 --> 06:36:31.033
ALWAYS SUPPORTED LAW

06:36:31.100 --> 06:36:32.735
ENFORCEMENT AND I'M HAPPY OF

06:36:32.802 --> 06:36:33.970
THE WORK THAT THEY DO FOR OUR

06:36:34.036 --> 06:36:35.004
COMMUNITIES. BUT WHEN MY

06:36:35.071 --> 06:36:36.239
COMMUNITY LIVES IN FEAR BECAUSE

06:36:36.305 --> 06:36:37.874
THEY CAN'T IDENTIFY WHO THESE

06:36:37.940 --> 06:36:39.675
INDIVIDUALS ARE, IN FACT, IN

06:36:39.742 --> 06:36:41.377
THE CITY OF HUNTINGTON PARK,

06:36:41.444 --> 06:36:44.013
OUR OWN PD ARRESTED SOMEONE

06:36:44.080 --> 06:36:46.149
THAT THAT WAS IMPERSONATING LAW,

06:36:46.215 --> 06:36:48.117
THESE MASKED INDIVIDUALS. SO

06:36:48.184 --> 06:36:50.353
THE FACT THAT, YOU KNOW, IN

06:36:50.419 --> 06:36:52.321
SPANISH, IT'S THE SAME NADA,

06:36:52.388 --> 06:36:54.190
NADA, TÂM IF YOU FEAR NOTHING,

06:36:54.257 --> 06:36:55.324
YOU SHOULD FEAR NOTHING. WE

06:36:55.391 --> 06:36:56.993
TRUST OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT. IT

06:36:57.059 --> 06:36:58.628
SHOULD BE OUT THERE DOING THEIR

06:36:58.694 --> 06:37:01.931
JOB. BUT. BUT WHY WEAR A MASK?

06:37:01.998 --> 06:37:03.566
LET'S HAVE EVERYONE SHOW THEIR

06:37:03.633 --> 06:37:05.334
FACE AND ENSURE THAT THE PUBLIC

06:37:05.401 --> 06:37:06.435
CONTINUES TO TRUST LAW

06:37:06.502 --> 06:37:09.505
ENFORCEMENT FOLKS THAT I ALWAYS

06:37:09.572 --> 06:37:10.540
LIKE TO SUPPORT. LET'S MAKE

06:37:10.606 --> 06:37:12.141
SURE OUR COMMUNITIES FEEL SAFE

06:37:12.208 --> 06:37:15.011
AND SECURE ALL THE TIME FOR MY

06:37:15.077 --> 06:37:17.280
DISTRICT, I WILL VOTE ON THIS

06:37:17.346 --> 06:37:19.115
ITEM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

06:37:19.182 --> 06:37:21.450
ASSEMBLY MEMBERS, ASSEMBLY

06:37:21.517 --> 06:37:22.852
MEMBER HANEY, YOU ARE

06:37:22.919 --> 06:37:26.022
RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MR.

06:37:26.088 --> 06:37:31.194
SPEAKER, AND MEMBERS AT 9:20

06:37:31.260 --> 06:37:35.598
A.M. ON THE 24TH OF JUNE IN

06:37:35.665 --> 06:37:37.266
DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES, A YOUNG

06:37:37.333 --> 06:37:40.136
WOMAN, 32 YEARS OLD, WAS

06:37:40.203 --> 06:37:42.471
HEADING INTO WORK AT A FOOTWEAR

06:37:42.538 --> 06:37:46.609
COMPANY WHEN MEN IN GATOR MASKS,

06:37:46.676 --> 06:37:49.078
FULLY COVERING THEIR FACES,

06:37:49.145 --> 06:37:51.514
JUMPED OUT OF A CAR AND STARTED

06:37:51.581 --> 06:37:53.149
CHASING VENDORS, PEOPLE ON THE

06:37:53.216 --> 06:37:55.284
STREET AND GRABBED HER AND

06:37:55.351 --> 06:37:58.120
THREW HER TO THE GROUND. SHE

06:37:58.187 --> 06:37:59.755
THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS BEING

06:37:59.822 --> 06:38:03.125
ABDUCTED. SHE COULDN'T SEE THE

06:38:03.192 --> 06:38:05.294
FACES OF THE MEN WHO HAD

06:38:05.361 --> 06:38:07.096
GRABBED HER. THEY DIDN'T

06:38:07.163 --> 06:38:09.599
IDENTIFY THEMSELVES. THEY THE

06:38:09.665 --> 06:38:11.033
CAR THAT THEY THREW HER INTO

06:38:11.100 --> 06:38:13.402
WAS NOT A POLICE VEHICLE. THEY

06:38:13.469 --> 06:38:16.072
WERE WEARING PLAIN CLOTHES. AND

06:38:16.138 --> 06:38:19.675
LATER SHE FOUND OUT THAT THESE

06:38:19.742 --> 06:38:22.612
MEN WERE OFFICERS OF THE

06:38:22.678 --> 06:38:24.347
IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS

06:38:24.413 --> 06:38:26.215
ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. THEY WERE

06:38:26.282 --> 06:38:28.517
LOOKING FOR PEOPLE TO QUESTION

06:38:28.584 --> 06:38:29.285
WHETHER THEY WERE LAWFULLY

06:38:29.352 --> 06:38:34.090
PRESENT IN THE US, AND THE

06:38:34.156 --> 06:38:36.993
YOUNG WOMAN, ANDREA VELEZ, WHO

06:38:37.059 --> 06:38:40.896
WAS ABDUCTED BY ICE ON THIS DAY,

06:38:40.963 --> 06:38:43.566
WAS A US CITIZEN. AND SHE GREW

06:38:43.633 --> 06:38:45.935
UP JUST A FEW BLOCKS FROM WHERE

06:38:46.002 --> 06:38:48.237
THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED. AS SHE

06:38:48.304 --> 06:38:51.073
WAS SAID LATER THAT THEY CAME

06:38:51.140 --> 06:38:53.542
OUT READY TO ATTACK ANYONE. AND

06:38:53.609 --> 06:38:55.444
I THOUGHT THAT I WAS BEING

06:38:55.511 --> 06:38:57.346
KIDNAPED. THIS SHOULD NEVER

06:38:57.413 --> 06:39:01.784
HAPPEN IN OUR STATE. THIS IS

06:39:01.851 --> 06:39:04.420
BRINGING TERROR AND FEAR TO

06:39:04.487 --> 06:39:07.156
COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE OF

06:39:07.223 --> 06:39:08.991
CALIFORNIA. OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT

06:39:09.058 --> 06:39:12.261
DO DESERVE OUR SUPPORT. THEY DO

06:39:12.328 --> 06:39:15.464
SOME OF THE MOST ESSENTIAL WORK

06:39:15.531 --> 06:39:16.899
TO KEEP RESIDENTS OF OUR STATE

06:39:16.966 --> 06:39:20.436
SAFE. AND IN ORDER FOR THAT TO

06:39:20.503 --> 06:39:23.172
BE DONE, WE NEED THEM TO HAVE

06:39:23.239 --> 06:39:25.574
THE TRUST OF THE COMMUNITIES IN

06:39:25.641 --> 06:39:27.343
WHICH THEY SERVE. AND A PART OF

06:39:27.410 --> 06:39:29.545
THAT IS KNOWING WHO THEY ARE.

06:39:29.612 --> 06:39:30.980
THIS IS A STANDARD THAT LAW

06:39:31.047 --> 06:39:32.581
ENFORCEMENT HAVE ACROSS OUR

06:39:32.648 --> 06:39:34.350
STATE THAT COULD NOT BE MORE

06:39:34.417 --> 06:39:36.218
IMPORTANT TO THEIR ABILITY TO

06:39:36.285 --> 06:39:39.355
HAVE THAT TRUST THAT KEEPS OUR

06:39:39.422 --> 06:39:42.124
RESIDENTS SAFE. IT'S SIMPLE. NO

06:39:42.191 --> 06:39:45.628
SECRET POLICE IN THE STATE OF

06:39:45.695 --> 06:39:47.163
CALIFORNIA. IF YOU HAVE A

06:39:47.229 --> 06:39:48.964
LEGITIMATE REASON TO HAVE A

06:39:49.031 --> 06:39:51.133
MASK OR COVER YOUR FACE THAT IS

06:39:51.200 --> 06:39:53.769
ALLOWED UNDER THIS BILL. BUT IF

06:39:53.836 --> 06:39:55.371
THE PURPOSE IS SIMPLY TO HIDE

06:39:55.438 --> 06:39:59.141
YOUR IDENTITY, TO MUDDY WHETHER

06:39:59.208 --> 06:40:01.410
OR NOT YOU ARE ACTUALLY LAW

06:40:01.477 --> 06:40:03.512
ENFORCEMENT OR SOMEONE WHO IS

06:40:03.579 --> 06:40:06.282
SIMPLY THERE TO DO SOMETHING

06:40:06.349 --> 06:40:09.852
THAT YOU ARE ATTEMPTING TO

06:40:09.919 --> 06:40:13.222
CONCEAL. THIS IS THIS. THIS

06:40:13.289 --> 06:40:16.359
BILL LAYS OUT VERY CLEARLY THAT

06:40:16.425 --> 06:40:18.327
CHOICE. DO NOT CONCEAL YOUR

06:40:18.394 --> 06:40:20.262
IDENTITY. IF YOU ARE

06:40:20.329 --> 06:40:22.231
LEGITIMATELY ENGAGING IN LAW

06:40:22.298 --> 06:40:24.266
ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES, THAT

06:40:24.333 --> 06:40:26.402
SHOULD BE A STANDARD THAT WE

06:40:26.469 --> 06:40:28.237
EXTEND TO EVERY ONE IN OUR

06:40:28.304 --> 06:40:29.972
STATE. THIS SHOULD NOT BE

06:40:30.039 --> 06:40:32.808
COMPLICATED. IN A DEMOCRACY, A

06:40:32.875 --> 06:40:34.076
CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY WHERE

06:40:34.143 --> 06:40:36.078
OUR RESIDENTS HAVE RIGHTS TO

06:40:36.145 --> 06:40:37.513
KNOW IF THEY ARE ENGAGING WITH

06:40:37.580 --> 06:40:40.015
A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL, TO

06:40:40.082 --> 06:40:41.817
KNOW WHO THEY ARE ENGAGING WITH

06:40:41.884 --> 06:40:43.018
AND UNDERSTANDING WHO THAT THE

06:40:43.085 --> 06:40:45.254
IDENTITY OF THAT PERSON, OR IF

06:40:45.321 --> 06:40:47.390
IN FACT, THEY SHOULD BE AFRAID

06:40:47.456 --> 06:40:48.224
AND THEY MAY ACTUALLY BE

06:40:48.290 --> 06:40:50.159
KIDNAPED, OR THEY MAY HAVE

06:40:50.226 --> 06:40:51.394
SOMEBODY WHO IS CONCEALING

06:40:51.460 --> 06:40:53.863
THEIR IDENTITY FOR A PARTICULAR

06:40:53.929 --> 06:40:56.632
NEFARIOUS PURPOSE. THIS BILL

06:40:56.699 --> 06:40:58.534
STRIKES THAT BALANCE. IT WILL

06:40:58.601 --> 06:41:00.236
HELP TO ENSURE THAT OUR

06:41:00.302 --> 06:41:01.704
RESIDENTS KNOW WHO THEY ARE

06:41:01.771 --> 06:41:02.738
DEALING WITH. IT WILL INCREASE

06:41:02.805 --> 06:41:04.907
AND ENHANCE AND ENSURE TRUST

06:41:04.974 --> 06:41:06.609
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT, WHICH IS

06:41:06.675 --> 06:41:08.110
SO ESSENTIAL, AND WILL ALSO

06:41:08.177 --> 06:41:09.912
MAKE SURE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT

06:41:09.979 --> 06:41:11.580
KNOW WHO THEY ARE DEALING WITH.

06:41:11.647 --> 06:41:12.815
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SHOULD

06:41:12.882 --> 06:41:14.350
BE SO CONCERNING FOR US IS

06:41:14.417 --> 06:41:16.085
MISTAKEN IDENTITY CAN PUT ALL

06:41:16.152 --> 06:41:17.286
OF THESE FOLKS AT RISK. OUR

06:41:17.353 --> 06:41:19.054
RESIDENTS, LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND

06:41:19.121 --> 06:41:21.157
EVEN SOME OF THESE FOLKS WHO

06:41:21.223 --> 06:41:23.359
ARE WEARING THESE MASKS. THIS

06:41:23.426 --> 06:41:25.428
IS A SHOULD BE A STANDARD THAT

06:41:25.494 --> 06:41:27.830
WE CAN EXTEND TO EVERYONE IN

06:41:27.897 --> 06:41:30.232
OUR STATE. NO SECRET POLICE, NO

06:41:30.299 --> 06:41:32.334
CONCEALING YOUR FACE OR YOUR

06:41:32.401 --> 06:41:34.036
IDENTITY. IF YOU ARE ENGAGING

06:41:34.103 --> 06:41:36.205
IN LEGITIMATE LAW ENFORCEMENT

06:41:36.272 --> 06:41:37.473
ACTIVITIES IN OUR STATE. AND SO

06:41:37.540 --> 06:41:39.241
THIS SHOULD BE, I BELIEVE,

06:41:39.308 --> 06:41:41.210
SOMETHING WE ALL STAND BEHIND

06:41:41.277 --> 06:41:43.078
TO ENSURE SAFETY OF OUR

06:41:43.145 --> 06:41:44.246
RESIDENTS AND THE TRUST THAT IS

06:41:44.313 --> 06:41:46.949
SO ESSENTIAL FOR PUBLIC SAFETY.

06:41:47.016 --> 06:41:49.852
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE

06:41:49.919 --> 06:41:52.288
ON SB 627. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

06:41:52.354 --> 06:41:54.457
MEMBER. HAYNIE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

06:41:54.523 --> 06:41:56.725
DEMAIO, YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

06:41:56.792 --> 06:41:59.328
THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. I RISE

06:41:59.395 --> 06:42:02.097
IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO SB 627,

06:42:02.164 --> 06:42:05.701
A BILL THAT THE MAJORITY PARTY

06:42:05.768 --> 06:42:07.903
DESCRIBES AS A BILL FOR PUBLIC

06:42:07.970 --> 06:42:11.073
SAFETY TO RESTORE TRUST IN OUR

06:42:11.140 --> 06:42:14.410
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. NO,

06:42:14.477 --> 06:42:17.246
THIS COMES FROM THE MAJORITY

06:42:17.313 --> 06:42:19.048
THAT JUST A FEW YEARS AGO, AT

06:42:19.114 --> 06:42:21.550
THE TOP OF YOUR LUNGS, YOU WERE

06:42:21.617 --> 06:42:24.453
SCREAMING, DEFUND THE POLICE.

06:42:24.520 --> 06:42:26.288
AND THEN WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT

06:42:26.355 --> 06:42:28.157
DIDN'T PULL VERY WELL, YOU

06:42:28.224 --> 06:42:29.992
DECIDED, OKAY, LET'S LET'S NOT

06:42:30.059 --> 06:42:32.661
COME RIGHT OUT AND SAY IT.

06:42:32.728 --> 06:42:33.229
DEFUND THE POLICE. INSTEAD,

06:42:33.295 --> 06:42:35.264
LET'S MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY

06:42:35.331 --> 06:42:38.334
IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO DO THEIR

06:42:38.400 --> 06:42:41.036
JOBS, THE JOBS TO PROTECT OUR

06:42:41.103 --> 06:42:45.074
NEIGHBORHOODS. AND WHAT HAVE

06:42:45.140 --> 06:42:47.343
YOU DONE SINCE THEN? INSTEAD OF

06:42:47.409 --> 06:42:49.044
JUST DEFUNDING THE POLICE,

06:42:49.111 --> 06:42:51.146
YOU'VE MADE THEIR LIVES

06:42:51.213 --> 06:42:52.248
MISERABLE. YOU'VE PUT THEIR

06:42:52.314 --> 06:42:54.049
LIVES AT RISK THROUGH YOUR

06:42:54.116 --> 06:42:57.219
RHETORIC AND YOUR BAD POLICIES.

06:42:57.286 --> 06:43:00.556
YOU PASSED ASSEMBLY BILL 392 TO

06:43:00.623 --> 06:43:03.359
MAKE CALIFORNIA THE ONLY STATE

06:43:03.425 --> 06:43:05.961
IN THE COUNTRY THAT SECOND

06:43:06.028 --> 06:43:07.997
GUESSES OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT

06:43:08.063 --> 06:43:10.799
OFFICERS. JUST A MOMENT. JUST A

06:43:10.866 --> 06:43:12.001
MOMENT. MR. DEMAIO, ASSEMBLY

06:43:12.067 --> 06:43:13.369
MEMBER BERMAN, STATE YOUR POINT

06:43:13.435 --> 06:43:15.371
OF ORDER. I WOULD ASK MY

06:43:15.437 --> 06:43:16.105
COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO TO

06:43:16.171 --> 06:43:18.073
SPEAK TO THE MERITS OF THIS

06:43:18.140 --> 06:43:20.042
BILL AND NOT PRIOR BILLS THAT

06:43:20.109 --> 06:43:20.609
THIS LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED.

06:43:20.676 --> 06:43:22.144
YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN, MR.

06:43:22.211 --> 06:43:23.445
BERMAN. MR. DEMAIO, PLEASE

06:43:23.512 --> 06:43:24.947
SPEAK TO THE MERITS OF THIS

06:43:25.014 --> 06:43:26.248
LEGISLATION. IF MR. BERMAN

06:43:26.315 --> 06:43:28.183
WOULD KEEP DECORUM AND STOP

06:43:28.250 --> 06:43:29.351
INTERRUPTING ME AS I'M TRYING

06:43:29.418 --> 06:43:30.953
TO MAKE MY. EXCUSE ME, MR.

06:43:31.020 --> 06:43:33.222
DEMAIO, YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER.

06:43:33.289 --> 06:43:35.057
MR. BERMAN. IT'S OKAY. MR.

06:43:35.124 --> 06:43:37.192
DEMAIO, YOU ARE OUT OF ORDER.

06:43:37.259 --> 06:43:39.094
PLEASE DO NOT REFER TO YOUR

06:43:39.161 --> 06:43:41.330
COLLEAGUES BY THEIR LAST NAME.

06:43:41.397 --> 06:43:42.631
THIS IS A TRADITION IN THE

06:43:42.698 --> 06:43:44.066
RULES OF THIS HOUSE. PLEASE

06:43:44.133 --> 06:43:45.100
CONTINUE TO BREAK THE

06:43:45.167 --> 06:43:46.302
TRADITIONS OF THE HOUSE AS

06:43:46.368 --> 06:43:47.937
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN

06:43:48.003 --> 06:43:48.904
IMPORTANT MATTER OF PUBLIC

06:43:48.971 --> 06:43:49.538
SAFETY. NÓ WOULDN'T WANT THAT

06:43:49.605 --> 06:43:50.940
TO HAPPEN. THAT WOULD BE MR.

06:43:51.006 --> 06:43:53.075
DEMAIO. MR. DEMAIO. THIS IS THE

06:43:53.142 --> 06:43:54.243
LAST WARNING I'M GOING TO GIVE

06:43:54.310 --> 06:43:55.878
YOU, AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO

06:43:55.945 --> 06:43:57.379
MOVE ON. THE REASON WHY I

06:43:57.446 --> 06:43:58.414
RAISED THE ISSUE OF LIABILITY

06:43:58.480 --> 06:44:00.616
OF OFFICERS, BECAUSE THIS BILL,

06:44:00.683 --> 06:44:03.185
SB 627, CONTINUES THE DAMAGE

06:44:03.252 --> 06:44:06.322
DONE BY ASSEMBLY BILL 392 BY

06:44:06.388 --> 06:44:08.257
MAKING IT MORE RISKY FOR AN

06:44:08.324 --> 06:44:09.992
OFFICER TO PERFORM THEIR DUTIES,

06:44:10.059 --> 06:44:13.195
IT BRINGS CIVIL LIABILITY ON

06:44:13.262 --> 06:44:14.463
THEM BY CHANGING QUALIFIED

06:44:14.530 --> 06:44:16.231
IMMUNITY. AND DO YOU THINK

06:44:16.298 --> 06:44:17.967
THEY'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO THE

06:44:18.033 --> 06:44:19.134
JOB? BUT ISN'T THAT THE THE

06:44:19.201 --> 06:44:22.271
PLAN BEHIND SB 627 AS AN

06:44:22.338 --> 06:44:25.107
EXTENSION OF AB 392, TO MAKE IT

06:44:25.174 --> 06:44:26.508
MORE RISKY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT

06:44:26.575 --> 06:44:29.178
TO DO THEIR JOBS LEGALLY, THEY

06:44:29.244 --> 06:44:32.247
COULD BE CHARGED WITH THE CRIME.

06:44:32.314 --> 06:44:34.183
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHY WOULD

06:44:34.249 --> 06:44:36.919
THEY BE WANTING TO SHIELD THEIR

06:44:36.986 --> 06:44:39.488
FACE? DO YOU WANT TO SECOND

06:44:39.555 --> 06:44:40.723
GUESS THEIR PROFESSIONAL

06:44:40.789 --> 06:44:44.159
JUDGMENT? HAVE YOU DONE A SHIFT

06:44:44.226 --> 06:44:45.961
IN THE FIELD? IF THEY NEED TO

06:44:46.028 --> 06:44:47.496
SHIELD THEIR FACE, IT'S

06:44:47.563 --> 06:44:49.264
PROBABLY FOR A GOOD REASON. BUT

06:44:49.331 --> 06:44:51.634
NO, YOU WANT TO TAKE THAT

06:44:51.700 --> 06:44:53.168
ABILITY AWAY FROM THEM. SO HERE

06:44:53.235 --> 06:44:54.103
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A BILL THAT

06:44:54.169 --> 06:44:56.171
MAKES IT HARDER FOR THEM TO DO

06:44:56.238 --> 06:44:57.439
THEIR JOB. BECAUSE I THINK

06:44:57.506 --> 06:44:59.508
YOU'RE REAL INTENT IS TO DRIVE

06:44:59.575 --> 06:45:02.244
THEM OFF THE FORCE TO HARASS

06:45:02.311 --> 06:45:03.946
THEM, MAKE IT HARDER FOR THEM

06:45:04.013 --> 06:45:05.214
TO DO THEIR JOB. AND AS A

06:45:05.280 --> 06:45:07.416
RESULT, WE WILL HAVE VACANCIES

06:45:07.483 --> 06:45:08.317
IN OUR POLICE DEPARTMENTS. WHEN

06:45:08.384 --> 06:45:10.319
YOU DIAL 911, YOU WILL NOT BE

06:45:10.386 --> 06:45:12.287
ABLE TO GET SOMEONE. MAYBE

06:45:12.354 --> 06:45:13.022
THEY'RE PROTECTING KAMALA

06:45:13.088 --> 06:45:14.590
HARRIS OR WHO KNOWS WHAT

06:45:14.657 --> 06:45:16.191
THEY'VE BEEN ASSIGNED, OR MAYBE

06:45:16.258 --> 06:45:16.992
THEY'RE DOING ONE OF THE

06:45:17.059 --> 06:45:19.094
MEANINGLESS REPORTS THAT THIS

06:45:19.161 --> 06:45:20.429
LEGISLATURE NOW REQUIRES THEM

06:45:20.496 --> 06:45:23.465
TO DO. BUT AT SOME POINT IT

06:45:23.532 --> 06:45:24.266
BREAKS THEIR BACK. AT SOME

06:45:24.333 --> 06:45:25.934
POINT, THEY SAY, WHY BOTHER

06:45:26.001 --> 06:45:28.771
STAYING IN CALIFORNIA WHEN I AM

06:45:28.837 --> 06:45:30.239
NOT APPRECIATED? WHEN MY LIFE

06:45:30.305 --> 06:45:33.142
IS PUT ON THE LINE, WHEN MY OWN

06:45:33.208 --> 06:45:36.045
ELECTED LEADERS TRIED TO

06:45:36.111 --> 06:45:39.248
DEMORALIZE THE FORCE BY SAYING,

06:45:39.314 --> 06:45:40.115
I'M TRYING TO ARREST PEOPLE

06:45:40.182 --> 06:45:41.717
BECAUSE OF THEIR SKIN COLOR,

06:45:41.784 --> 06:45:44.019
HOW SHAMEFUL. ON USE OF FORCE

06:45:44.086 --> 06:45:46.488
ISSUES. YOU CLAIM THAT THEY'RE

06:45:46.555 --> 06:45:47.923
BRUTES WHEN THEY'RE OUT THERE

06:45:47.990 --> 06:45:49.224
DOING PATROLS AND DOING THEIR

06:45:49.291 --> 06:45:52.261
JOB. YOU SAY THEY'RE RACIST AND

06:45:52.327 --> 06:45:54.029
YOU WONDER WHY WE HAVE A

06:45:54.096 --> 06:45:55.264
RECRUITMENT RETENTION PROBLEM

06:45:55.330 --> 06:45:56.732
IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. YOU WONDER

06:45:56.799 --> 06:45:58.200
WHY 911 PRIORITY CALLS TAKE SO

06:45:58.267 --> 06:46:01.203
LONG TO RESPOND TO. AND YES,

06:46:01.270 --> 06:46:04.707
PEOPLE WILL GET KILLED AS A

06:46:04.773 --> 06:46:06.475
RESULT OF BAD POLICY. BUT WE

06:46:06.542 --> 06:46:10.212
MUST MAINTAIN DECORUM. I THINK

06:46:10.279 --> 06:46:11.680
IT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO TELL THE

06:46:11.747 --> 06:46:12.948
TRUTH. I THINK IT'S MORE

06:46:13.015 --> 06:46:14.216
IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE GOOD

06:46:14.283 --> 06:46:18.721
POLICY. THIS BILL IS NOT EVEN

06:46:18.787 --> 06:46:20.389
CONSTITUTIONAL AT THE FEDERAL

06:46:20.456 --> 06:46:21.123
GOVERNMENT. CERTAINLY IS NOT

06:46:21.190 --> 06:46:23.225
GOING TO FOLLOW IT. BUT ISN'T

06:46:23.292 --> 06:46:24.393
THAT THE TARGET, YOU SAY? OH,

06:46:24.460 --> 06:46:26.128
BUT HOLD ON A SECOND. THE BILL

06:46:26.195 --> 06:46:28.731
WAS AMENDED TO ELIMINATE ITS

06:46:28.797 --> 06:46:30.466
APPLICABILITY TO STATE LAW

06:46:30.532 --> 06:46:32.401
ENFORCEMENT, BECAUSE THE

06:46:32.468 --> 06:46:34.570
GOVERNOR SEEMED TO HAVE A

06:46:34.636 --> 06:46:36.472
PROBLEM WITH THAT. I DON'T KNOW,

06:46:36.538 --> 06:46:37.406
MAYBE HIS SECURITY DETAIL HAS

06:46:37.473 --> 06:46:40.075
MASKS. WHO KNOWS? WHY WOULD I

06:46:40.142 --> 06:46:41.376
HAVE HEARD IS THAT THE GOVERNOR

06:46:41.443 --> 06:46:42.745
DIDN'T WANT STATE LAW

06:46:42.811 --> 06:46:44.446
ENFORCEMENT TO HAVE TO COMPLY

06:46:44.513 --> 06:46:46.215
WITH THIS BILL, BUT LOCAL LAW

06:46:46.281 --> 06:46:48.450
ENFORCEMENT HAS TO, YOU KNOW,

06:46:48.517 --> 06:46:49.351
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT

06:46:49.418 --> 06:46:53.322
PATROLS NEIGHBORHOODS FOR 30S

06:46:53.388 --> 06:46:55.357
AT THE SAME TIME THAT THIS BILL

06:46:55.424 --> 06:46:56.925
IS WINDING ITS WAY THROUGH TO

06:46:56.992 --> 06:46:58.894
SHIELD, TO TAKE AWAY THE

06:46:58.961 --> 06:47:00.162
ABILITY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO

06:47:00.229 --> 06:47:03.265
SHIELD THEMSELVES, TO PERHAPS

06:47:03.332 --> 06:47:04.833
PROTECT THEIR IDENTITIES FROM

06:47:04.900 --> 06:47:06.301
DOXXING AND TARGETING

06:47:06.368 --> 06:47:08.170
THEMSELVES PERSONALLY AND THEIR

06:47:08.237 --> 06:47:09.438
FAMILIES. SOME OF THE SAME

06:47:09.505 --> 06:47:11.440
POLITICIANS BACKING THIS BAD

06:47:11.507 --> 06:47:12.741
BILL FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT WANT

06:47:12.808 --> 06:47:14.710
TO SHIELD THEIR HOME ADDRESS

06:47:14.777 --> 06:47:15.244
FROM PUBLIC DISCLOSURE. I

06:47:15.310 --> 06:47:17.412
WONDER WHY. WHY DO THEY DESERVE

06:47:17.479 --> 06:47:18.914
PRIVACY WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT

06:47:18.981 --> 06:47:22.117
DOESN'T? IN CONCLUSION, WOULD

06:47:22.184 --> 06:47:25.020
YOU APPLY THE SAME NO MASK

06:47:25.087 --> 06:47:26.989
POLICY TO HOODLUMS THAT THROW

06:47:27.055 --> 06:47:28.991
BRICKS AT LAW ENFORCEMENT?

06:47:29.057 --> 06:47:36.598
THANK YOU. MR. THAT'S YOUR BASE.

06:47:36.665 --> 06:47:38.233
MEMBERS. I THINK THIS MIGHT BE

06:47:38.300 --> 06:47:40.202
A GOOD TIME TO REMIND EACH

06:47:40.269 --> 06:47:42.037
OTHER THAT DECORUM IS NOT ABOUT

06:47:42.104 --> 06:47:44.439
TRUTH OR UNTRUTH. IT IS ABOUT

06:47:44.506 --> 06:47:45.574
SPEAKING RESPECTFULLY AMONGST

06:47:45.641 --> 06:47:48.076
YOUR COLLEAGUES. WHEN WE HAVE

06:47:48.143 --> 06:47:49.611
DIFFERENCES OF OPINION AND

06:47:49.678 --> 06:47:52.381
DIFFERENCES OF PRIORITY,

06:47:52.447 --> 06:47:55.417
RESPECTFULLY. SOME MEMBER

06:47:55.484 --> 06:47:58.754
SHARON QUIRK-SILVA, YOU ARE

06:47:58.821 --> 06:48:03.358
RECOGNIZED. COLLEAGUES, I RISE

06:48:03.425 --> 06:48:05.727
TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF

06:48:05.794 --> 06:48:08.063
SENATE BILL 627, THE NØ SECRET

06:48:08.130 --> 06:48:10.132
POLICE ACT, WHICH LIMITS THE

06:48:10.199 --> 06:48:12.134
ABILITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TO

06:48:12.201 --> 06:48:16.171
ENGAGE IN EXTREME MASKING. SOME

06:48:16.238 --> 06:48:20.475
OF YOU MIGHT REMEMBER AN

06:48:20.542 --> 06:48:22.344
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER THAT

06:48:22.411 --> 06:48:24.179
TAUGHT FOURTH GRADE, AND OFTEN

06:48:24.246 --> 06:48:26.281
IN THAT GRADE, YOU TALK ABOUT

06:48:26.348 --> 06:48:27.182
LEGISLATION. YOU TALK ABOUT HOW

06:48:27.249 --> 06:48:30.419
A BILL BECOMES A LAW. AND WHEN

06:48:30.485 --> 06:48:32.020
LEGISLATION GETS CRAFTED HERE,

06:48:32.087 --> 06:48:35.490
SOMETIMES IT COMES FROM AN IDEA,

06:48:35.557 --> 06:48:37.359
FROM AN ADVOCATE, FROM SOMEBODY

06:48:37.426 --> 06:48:39.127
IN YOUR DISTRICT, FROM A

06:48:39.194 --> 06:48:42.297
SPONSOR. BUT IN THIS CASE, THIS

06:48:42.364 --> 06:48:44.132
PIECE OF LEGISLATION COMES OUT

06:48:44.199 --> 06:48:47.302
OF REAL LIFE EVENTS THAT

06:48:47.369 --> 06:48:49.338
STARTED ON THE STREETS OF

06:48:49.404 --> 06:48:52.140
CALIFORNIA IN JANUARY WITH THE

06:48:52.207 --> 06:48:54.142
BEGINNING OF THE RAIDS. AND

06:48:54.209 --> 06:48:57.346
WHAT ARE THE RAIDS? THE RAIDS

06:48:57.412 --> 06:49:02.050
ARE A DIRECT ASSAULT ON OUR

06:49:02.117 --> 06:49:06.588
IMMIGRATION COMMUNITY. WHO

06:49:06.655 --> 06:49:08.624
BEGAN AND PARTICIPATED IN THE

06:49:08.690 --> 06:49:15.264
RAIDS. OUR IMMIGRATION OFFICERS,

06:49:15.330 --> 06:49:20.569
DIRECTED BY OUR PRESIDENT. AND

06:49:20.636 --> 06:49:23.105
WHAT WE FIRST SAW WERE OFFICERS

06:49:23.171 --> 06:49:24.973
WEARING THEIR USUAL UNIFORMS.

06:49:25.040 --> 06:49:28.176
AND THEN CAME THE EXTREME

06:49:28.243 --> 06:49:30.345
MASKING, NOT ONLY WITH MASKS

06:49:30.412 --> 06:49:32.948
BUT SUNGLASSES. AND WHY? TO

06:49:33.015 --> 06:49:35.017
PROTECT THEIR IDENTITY. WITH

06:49:35.083 --> 06:49:36.985
THAT, WE'VE HEARD AND SEEN

06:49:37.052 --> 06:49:40.455
CASES OF ABUSE OTHERS IMITATING

06:49:40.522 --> 06:49:42.991
THESE OFFICERS AND SOMETIMES

06:49:43.058 --> 06:49:45.093
ACTUALLY NOT BEING AN OFFICER.

06:49:45.160 --> 06:49:48.063
SO IMAGINE GROUPS AND CROWDS OF

06:49:48.130 --> 06:49:50.165
PEOPLE, WHETHER IT'S AT A

06:49:50.232 --> 06:49:54.136
PROTEST OR A PARADE OR EVEN THE

06:49:54.202 --> 06:49:56.171
OLYMPICS, AND ALL OF OUR LOCAL

06:49:56.238 --> 06:49:58.206
POLICE OFFICERS, ALL OF OUR

06:49:58.273 --> 06:50:00.642
FEDERAL POLICE OFFICERS OR

06:50:00.709 --> 06:50:02.411
PUBLIC SAFETY ARE ALL MASKED.

06:50:02.477 --> 06:50:06.548
IT ALMOST REMINDS ME OF A JAMES

06:50:06.615 --> 06:50:09.518
PATTERSON NOVEL WHERE NO ONE

06:50:09.584 --> 06:50:12.254
KNOWS WHO IS THE GOOD GUY, WHO

06:50:12.321 --> 06:50:15.023
IS THE BAD GUY? WHO IS THE SPY?

06:50:15.090 --> 06:50:18.193
BECAUSE OF MASKING RIGHT NOW,

06:50:18.260 --> 06:50:22.164
IN THE MAJORITY OF OUR LOCAL

06:50:22.230 --> 06:50:24.132
MUNICIPALITIES, OUR POLICE

06:50:24.199 --> 06:50:27.269
OFFICERS DO NOT WEAR MASKS AND

06:50:27.336 --> 06:50:30.138
THEY HAVEN'T WORN MASKS. AS A

06:50:30.205 --> 06:50:31.907
MATTER OF FACT, I REMEMBER A

06:50:31.974 --> 06:50:34.443
HANDFUL OF YEARS AGO WHEN WE

06:50:34.509 --> 06:50:36.578
WERE IN COVID AND THERE WAS

06:50:36.645 --> 06:50:39.147
SUCH AN OUTCRY AGAINST WEARING

06:50:39.214 --> 06:50:40.682
MASKS BECAUSE OF COVID,

06:50:40.749 --> 06:50:43.051
STARTING FROM OUR CURRENT

06:50:43.118 --> 06:50:45.020
PRESIDENT. AND NOW WE HAVE A

06:50:45.087 --> 06:50:48.824
TURN OF EVENTS. BUT IF YOU

06:50:48.890 --> 06:50:49.257
THINK ABOUT YOUR OWN

06:50:49.324 --> 06:50:50.592
MUNICIPALITY, POLICE DEPARTMENT,

06:50:50.659 --> 06:50:52.294
YOUR LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT,

06:50:52.361 --> 06:50:54.396
THEY DON'T WEAR MASKS. THEY DO

06:50:54.463 --> 06:50:57.165
WEAR A BADGE. AND EVEN WITH

06:50:57.232 --> 06:50:59.668
THAT, WE'VE SEEN WHEN THERE

06:50:59.735 --> 06:51:01.503
HAVE BEEN RAIDS, WE HAVE SEEN

06:51:01.570 --> 06:51:04.339
WHERE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ASKING

06:51:04.406 --> 06:51:07.109
TO SHOW THEIR BADGE. AND IN

06:51:07.175 --> 06:51:09.111
THIS CASE, I'M TALKING ABOUT

06:51:09.177 --> 06:51:10.312
ICE OFFICERS. THEY'VE REFUSED

06:51:10.379 --> 06:51:13.281
TO DO THAT. WE'VE SEEN WINDOWS

06:51:13.348 --> 06:51:15.317
BROKEN TO PULL PEOPLE OUT OF

06:51:15.384 --> 06:51:18.020
THEIR CARS. WE'VE SEEN PEOPLE

06:51:18.086 --> 06:51:20.155
CHASED AND RUN DOWN IN THE

06:51:20.222 --> 06:51:21.723
CENTRAL VALLEY WHERE AN

06:51:21.790 --> 06:51:24.426
INDIVIDUAL WAS KILLED. WE'VE

06:51:24.493 --> 06:51:26.361
ALSO SEEN THEM RUN OVER THROUGH

06:51:26.428 --> 06:51:29.598
A FREEWAY WHERE AN ICE AGENT

06:51:29.664 --> 06:51:31.133
WAS CHASING AND SOMEONE WAS

06:51:31.199 --> 06:51:34.236
KILLED. SO THIS WAS THIS HAS

06:51:34.302 --> 06:51:37.072
ALL STARTED JUST IN THE LAST

06:51:37.139 --> 06:51:39.674
SIX MONTHS. SO WHEN MY

06:51:39.741 --> 06:51:41.476
COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO

06:51:41.543 --> 06:51:43.078
CONTINUES THE FEAR MONGERING

06:51:43.145 --> 06:51:47.482
AND USING RHETORIC TO GASLIGHT

06:51:47.549 --> 06:51:48.950
US, THAT HAS HAPPENED ALMOST

06:51:49.017 --> 06:51:51.386
SINCE THE DAY HE'S WALKED ONTO

06:51:51.453 --> 06:51:57.459
THIS FLOOR, I DISSENT. WE

06:51:57.526 --> 06:52:02.230
DISSENT BECAUSE WE KNOW RIGHT

06:52:02.297 --> 06:52:05.333
NOW ON THIS FLOOR, MANY OF US

06:52:05.400 --> 06:52:07.002
COULD BE TARGETED. YES, WE'RE

06:52:07.069 --> 06:52:10.138
WEARING SUITS. YES, WE HAVE OUR

06:52:10.205 --> 06:52:12.407
PINS. BUT WHAT IF WE DON'T?

06:52:12.474 --> 06:52:14.743
WHAT IF WE'RE WALKING IN OUR

06:52:14.810 --> 06:52:19.114
NEIGHBORHOOD AT NIGHT? THIS IS

06:52:19.181 --> 06:52:21.950
ABOUT EXTREME MASKING. THE

06:52:22.017 --> 06:52:25.487
BOTTOM LINE IS, UP UNTIL SIX

06:52:25.554 --> 06:52:28.223
MONTHS AGO, WE NEVER HAD AN

06:52:28.290 --> 06:52:29.424
ISSUE WITH OUR LOCAL POLICE

06:52:29.491 --> 06:52:31.093
DEPARTMENT OR PUBLIC SAFETY

06:52:31.159 --> 06:52:33.161
SAYING, I NEED TO WEAR A MASK

06:52:33.228 --> 06:52:35.530
HERE, I NEED I'M WORRIED ABOUT

06:52:35.597 --> 06:52:40.102
DOXING. NO, THIS BILL IS ABOUT

06:52:40.168 --> 06:52:42.871
IDENTIFYING YOURSELF, AND IT'S

06:52:42.938 --> 06:52:44.473
ABOUT UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE

06:52:44.539 --> 06:52:49.377
IS NO SECRET POLICE. BUT IT'S

06:52:49.444 --> 06:52:52.914
EVEN MORE ABOUT OUR COMMUNITIES

06:52:52.981 --> 06:52:55.417
THAT ARE BEING TERRORIZED AND

06:52:55.484 --> 06:52:57.352
TRAUMATIZED. AND WITH THAT, I

06:52:57.419 --> 06:52:59.187
SUPPORT THIS BILL AND ASK FOR

06:52:59.254 --> 06:53:02.057
YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU.

06:53:02.124 --> 06:53:03.692
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. QUIRK-SILVA

YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU,

06:53:17.372 --> 06:53:18.907
LATINOS AND TODAY IS SPEAKING

06:53:18.974 --> 06:53:21.109
OUT AGAINST THEM FOR THE LAST

06:53:21.176 --> 06:53:24.346
95 DAYS. YES, 95 DAYS. MY

06:53:24.412 --> 06:53:26.915
DISTRICT. JUST A MOMENT, MR.

06:53:26.982 --> 06:53:28.984

YOUR POINT OF ORDER. MR.

06:53:30.218 --> 06:53:32.120
SPEAKER. IF THE MEMBER WOULD

REFRAIN FROM DISPARAGING

06:53:33.922 --> 06:53:36.224
ANOTHER MEMBER OF THIS CHAMBER.

06:53:36.291 --> 06:53:38.460
THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

06:53:38.527 --> 06:53:40.195

06:53:41.963 --> 06:53:43.498
SPEECH POSITIVELY, PLEASE.

06:53:43.565 --> 06:53:46.635
GREAT. FOR THE LAST 95 DAYS, MY

06:53:46.701 --> 06:53:48.236
DISTRICT NÓ MY HOME AND MANY OF

06:53:48.303 --> 06:53:50.705
US HERE ARE HOME HAS BEEN UNDER

06:53:50.772 --> 06:53:52.240
SIEGE. FAMILIES IN MY COMMUNITY

06:53:52.307 --> 06:53:54.943
HAVE LIVED IN CONSTANT FEAR.

06:53:55.010 --> 06:53:56.178
FEAR THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

06:53:56.244 --> 06:53:58.380
NIGHT, ICE AGENTS WILL ARRIVE

06:53:58.446 --> 06:54:00.582
MASKED, UNANNOUNCED AND

06:54:00.649 --> 06:54:02.083
UNIDENTIFIED. THAT SHOULD DRAW

06:54:02.150 --> 06:54:03.885
YOUR POINT OF ORDER. THEY LIVE

06:54:03.952 --> 06:54:06.054
IN FEAR THAT CHILDREN ARE MOMS

06:54:06.121 --> 06:54:07.255
AND DADS WILL BE TAKEN,

06:54:07.322 --> 06:54:09.090
DISAPPEARING WITH NO PHONE CALL,

06:54:09.157 --> 06:54:13.862
NO EXPLANATION, AND NO TRACE

06:54:13.929 --> 06:54:15.330
SIMPLY GONE. AND LET'S BE CLEAR

06:54:15.397 --> 06:54:17.265
THEY'VE EVEN HAD THE AUDACITY

06:54:17.332 --> 06:54:18.867
TO SEIZE PEOPLE WHILE THEY'RE

06:54:18.934 --> 06:54:20.235
DOING EVERYDAY THINGS. PICKING

06:54:20.302 --> 06:54:21.903
UP A PRESCRIPTION AT THE

06:54:21.970 --> 06:54:23.205
DOCTOR'S OFFICE, BUYING TACOS

06:54:23.271 --> 06:54:25.340
ON THE STREET CORNER, TAKING

06:54:25.407 --> 06:54:27.475
THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL. NORMAL

06:54:27.542 --> 06:54:31.279
MOMENTS TURNED INTO NIGHTMARES.

06:54:31.346 --> 06:54:32.113
JUST THIS WEEK, AS IT WAS

06:54:32.180 --> 06:54:33.315
MENTIONED, THE SUPREME COURT

06:54:33.381 --> 06:54:34.616
GAVE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

06:54:34.683 --> 06:54:37.385
THE GREEN LIGHT TO RESUME THESE

06:54:37.452 --> 06:54:38.019
INDISCRIMINATE ROAMING

06:54:38.086 --> 06:54:40.622
IMMIGRATION RAIDS IN LOS

06:54:40.689 --> 06:54:43.892
ANGELES. THE MANHUNT HAS BEGUN.

06:54:43.959 --> 06:54:46.027
OUR NEIGHBORS CAN NOW BE

06:54:46.094 --> 06:54:47.229
STALKED THROUGH THE NIGHT BY

06:54:47.295 --> 06:54:48.396
SECRET POLICE SIMPLY FOR THE

06:54:48.463 --> 06:54:50.065
COLOR OF THEIR SKIN, OR THE

06:54:50.131 --> 06:54:53.802
LANGUAGE THAT THEY SPEAK. THIS

06:54:53.868 --> 06:54:55.036
IS NOT LAW ENFORCEMENT. THIS IS

06:54:55.103 --> 06:54:57.939
STATE SANCTIONED TERROR. AND,

06:54:58.006 --> 06:55:00.475
COLLEAGUES, I WANT TO POINT OUT

06:55:00.542 --> 06:55:02.210
ONE MORE HYPOCRISY THAT CANNOT

06:55:02.277 --> 06:55:03.111
GO UNNOTICED. AND IT WAS

06:55:03.178 --> 06:55:05.180
ALREADY BRIEFLY MENTIONED. OUR

06:55:05.247 --> 06:55:06.648
REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES SPENT

06:55:06.715 --> 06:55:09.251
YEARS MOCKING MASK DURING COVID,

06:55:09.317 --> 06:55:11.319
TELLING US THAT A SIMPLE CLOTH

06:55:11.386 --> 06:55:13.021
FACE COVERING WAS GOVERNMENT

06:55:13.088 --> 06:55:16.992
TYRANNY. BUT NOW THEY'RE

06:55:17.058 --> 06:55:18.226
PERFECTLY FINE WITH MASKS WHEN

06:55:18.293 --> 06:55:20.328
ICE AGENTS WEAR THEM TO SNATCH

06:55:20.395 --> 06:55:21.529
FATHERS, MOTHERS AND CHILDREN

06:55:21.596 --> 06:55:24.899
OFF THE STREETS. ANTI-MASK WHEN

06:55:24.966 --> 06:55:27.569
IT SAVES LIVES, PRO MASK WHEN

06:55:27.636 --> 06:55:29.371
IT DESTROYS THEM. THAT'S WHO

06:55:29.437 --> 06:55:32.140
WE'RE DEALING WITH. LET ME ALSO

06:55:32.207 --> 06:55:33.975
BE CRYSTAL CLEAR. THIS BILL IS

06:55:34.042 --> 06:55:36.011
NOT AN ATTACK ON OUR LOCAL LAW

06:55:36.077 --> 06:55:37.178
ENFORCEMENT. IN FACT, OUR

06:55:37.245 --> 06:55:38.413
POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND SHERIFFS

06:55:38.480 --> 06:55:40.048
ALREADY ABIDE BY CALIFORNIA LAW

06:55:40.115 --> 06:55:42.150
THAT PROHIBITS COORDINATION

06:55:42.217 --> 06:55:45.020
WITH ICE. SB 627 SIMPLY

06:55:45.086 --> 06:55:46.254
REINFORCES THAT COMMITMENT THAT

06:55:46.321 --> 06:55:47.956
OUR OFFICERS ARE HERE TO

06:55:48.023 --> 06:55:50.458
PROTECT AND TO SERVE, AND IT

06:55:50.525 --> 06:55:51.293
SEPARATES LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM

06:55:51.359 --> 06:55:55.063
MASKED VIGILANTES. SB 627 IS

06:55:55.130 --> 06:55:56.331
ABOUT MORE THAN POLICY. IT'S

06:55:56.398 --> 06:55:57.932
ABOUT DIGNITY, SAFETY AND

06:55:57.999 --> 06:56:01.236
HUMANITY. MY COMMUNITY IS NOT A

06:56:01.303 --> 06:56:04.172
HUNTING GROUND. MY NEIGHBORS

06:56:04.239 --> 06:56:07.075
ARE NOT YOUR PREY. COLLEAGUES

06:56:07.142 --> 06:56:08.410
HISTORY WILL REMEMBER WHETHER

06:56:08.476 --> 06:56:10.045
WE STOOD WITH FAMILIES, BEING

06:56:10.111 --> 06:56:12.113
STALKED IN THE SHADOWS, OR

06:56:12.180 --> 06:56:14.549
WHETHER WE LOOKED AWAY. I

06:56:14.616 --> 06:56:17.018
REFUSE TO LOOK AWAY WITH THAT.

06:56:17.085 --> 06:56:19.721
I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE

06:56:19.788 --> 06:56:22.524
ON SB 627. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

06:56:22.590 --> 06:56:23.491
MEMBER GONZALEZ. ASSEMBLY

06:56:23.558 --> 06:56:25.060
MEMBER ROGERS, YOU ARE

06:56:25.126 --> 06:56:35.203
RECOGNIZED. ALL RIGHT. THANK

06:56:35.270 --> 06:56:38.340
YOU SO MUCH, MR. SPEAKER. I

06:56:38.406 --> 06:56:40.108
OFTENTIMES LISTEN TO THE

06:56:40.175 --> 06:56:42.344
DISCUSSIONS ON THIS BODY, AND

06:56:42.410 --> 06:56:44.145
WHAT COMES TO MIND IS ONE OF MY

06:56:44.212 --> 06:56:46.114
FAVORITE QUOTES FROM A SHOW

06:56:46.181 --> 06:56:47.449
CALLED RICK AND MORTY. THE

06:56:47.515 --> 06:56:49.150
QUOTE GOES LIKE THIS I DON'T

06:56:49.217 --> 06:56:50.952
MIND YOUR BOOS BECAUSE I'VE

06:56:51.019 --> 06:56:54.556
SEEN WHAT MAKES YOU CHEER. AND

06:56:54.622 --> 06:56:55.790
WHEN I HEAR THESE DISCUSSIONS

06:56:55.857 --> 06:56:59.194
ABOUT BILLS LIKE SB 627, I

06:56:59.260 --> 06:57:00.962
CAN'T HELP BUT THINK THAT SOME

06:57:01.029 --> 06:57:02.297
OF MY COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE

06:57:02.364 --> 06:57:04.999
AISLE HAVE CHEERED THE EROSION

06:57:05.066 --> 06:57:06.234
OF DUE PROCESS. THEY'VE CHEERED

06:57:06.301 --> 06:57:09.003
A RETURN TO JIM CROW LAWS. THEY

06:57:09.070 --> 06:57:11.039
HAVE CHEERED THE MILITARY BEING

06:57:11.106 --> 06:57:12.674
TURNED ON OUR OWN PEOPLE. SO

06:57:12.741 --> 06:57:14.542
CONTINUE TO BOO WHILE DEMOCRATS

06:57:14.609 --> 06:57:17.045
TRY TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES

06:57:17.112 --> 06:57:19.047
BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN WHAT MAKES

06:57:19.114 --> 06:57:25.186
YOU CHEER. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

06:57:25.253 --> 06:57:27.188
MEMBER ROGERS, ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

06:57:27.255 --> 06:57:35.964
LACKEY, YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I

06:57:36.030 --> 06:57:39.100
USUALLY DON'T GET UP AND PACE,

06:57:39.167 --> 06:57:40.969
BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT I HAVE

06:57:41.035 --> 06:57:43.304
A HIGH DEGREE OF FRUSTRATION

06:57:43.371 --> 06:57:46.274
OVER THIS BECAUSE I CAN TELL

06:57:46.341 --> 06:57:47.842
YOU THAT I'M VERY SYMPATHETIC

06:57:47.909 --> 06:57:49.177
TO YOUR FRUSTRATION, VERY

06:57:49.244 --> 06:57:51.246
SYMPATHETIC. BUT YOU KNOW, WHAT

06:57:51.312 --> 06:57:54.082
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND IS THE

06:57:54.149 --> 06:57:56.851
FACTS OF WHAT THIS BILL WILL DO

06:57:56.918 --> 06:57:59.687
TO OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.

06:57:59.754 --> 06:58:01.723
WE DO NOT HAVE STATUTORY

06:58:01.790 --> 06:58:03.858
CONTROL OVER OUR FEDERAL

06:58:03.925 --> 06:58:04.459
OFFICERS. FOLKS, I KNOW YOU'D

06:58:04.526 --> 06:58:06.895
LOVE TO HAVE THAT, BUT RUN FOR

06:58:06.961 --> 06:58:08.730
CONGRESS. WE DO NOT HAVE

06:58:08.797 --> 06:58:10.331
CONTROL OVER OUR FEDERAL LAW

06:58:10.398 --> 06:58:12.233
ENFORCEMENT. LET ME REPEAT THAT.

06:58:12.300 --> 06:58:14.302
WE DO NOT HAVE CONTROL OVER

06:58:14.369 --> 06:58:18.106
THEM. THIS BILL IS A STRAW MAN.

06:58:18.173 --> 06:58:19.307
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE

06:58:19.374 --> 06:58:21.543
GOING AFTER SOMETHING VERY

06:58:21.609 --> 06:58:24.446
SACRED TO OFFICERS. QUALIFIED

06:58:24.512 --> 06:58:27.115
IMMUNITY, IT'S CALLED QUALIFIED

06:58:27.182 --> 06:58:31.119
FOR A REASON. IT PROTECTS

06:58:31.186 --> 06:58:33.054
OFFICERS FROM BEING SUED

06:58:33.121 --> 06:58:36.391
PERSONALLY. THINK ABOUT THE

06:58:36.458 --> 06:58:40.295
OFFICER WHO'S CONFRONTED WITH

06:58:40.361 --> 06:58:43.198
WHAT APPEARS TO BE A WEAPON,

06:58:43.264 --> 06:58:46.134
BUT IT'S A REPLICA WEAPON. AND

06:58:46.201 --> 06:58:48.636
THEY TAKE THE LIFE OF THAT

06:58:48.703 --> 06:58:51.105
INDIVIDUAL. WELL, GUESS WHAT?

06:58:51.172 --> 06:58:54.108
LAWYERS ARE SALIVATING AND THEY

06:58:54.175 --> 06:58:56.110
ARE GOING TO SUE THE PANTS OFF

06:58:56.177 --> 06:58:57.545
OF THAT OFFICER BECAUSE THAT

06:58:57.612 --> 06:59:01.149
WAS NOT A THREAT. YOU MAY NOT

06:59:01.216 --> 06:59:03.084
THINK THAT THAT'S REAL, BUT I'M

06:59:03.151 --> 06:59:06.321
TELLING YOU IT IS REAL AND IT'S

06:59:06.387 --> 06:59:10.692
SCARY. QUALIFIED IMMUNITY. THAT

06:59:10.758 --> 06:59:13.161
ASPECT OF THIS BILL HAS BEEN

06:59:13.228 --> 06:59:15.330
DEBATED BACK AND FORTH, BUT

06:59:15.396 --> 06:59:18.299
IT'S IN IT NOW. THAT IS A TOXIC

06:59:18.366 --> 06:59:21.135
POISON PILL. EVERYBODY I KNOW,

06:59:21.202 --> 06:59:23.505
THERE'S A LOT OF EMOTION AND A

06:59:23.571 --> 06:59:25.306
LOT OF FRUSTRATION OVER WHAT'S

06:59:25.373 --> 06:59:26.341
HAPPENED WITH OUR FEDERAL

06:59:26.407 --> 06:59:29.043
OFFICERS, I GET THAT, BUT THIS

06:59:29.110 --> 06:59:32.180
BILL WILL NOT FIX THAT. IT DOES

06:59:32.247 --> 06:59:34.048
NOT ADDRESS THAT ISSUE IN A

06:59:34.115 --> 06:59:37.919
REAL WAY. IT SENDS A MESSAGE,

06:59:37.986 --> 06:59:39.187
BUT THAT MESSAGE IS ALREADY

06:59:39.254 --> 06:59:41.289
BEING SENT THROUGH OTHER WAYS

06:59:41.356 --> 06:59:44.192
OF COMMUNICATION. I JUST ASK

06:59:44.259 --> 06:59:47.562
YOU TO PLEASE, PLEASE DO NOT

06:59:47.629 --> 06:59:50.198
SUPPORT ELIMINATING THE VERY

06:59:50.265 --> 06:59:53.134
SACRED PEACE THAT OUR PUBLIC

06:59:53.201 --> 06:59:55.470
SERVANTS RISKED THEIR LIVES FOR

06:59:55.537 --> 06:59:58.673
US. QUALIFIED IMMUNITY MUST

06:59:58.740 --> 06:59:59.974
CONTAIN CONTINUE, AND IF IT

07:00:00.041 --> 07:00:02.243
DOES NOT CONTINUE, WE'RE GOING

07:00:02.310 --> 07:00:05.079
TO SEE SO MUCH TRAGEDY AND

07:00:05.146 --> 07:00:07.582
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. WE WILL

07:00:07.649 --> 07:00:08.983
NOT BE ABLE TO RECRUIT FOLKS.

07:00:09.050 --> 07:00:10.218
IT'S GOING TO BE VERY, VERY

07:00:10.285 --> 07:00:12.086
DIFFICULT TO RECRUIT OFFICERS

07:00:12.153 --> 07:00:13.221
WHEN CALIFORNIA DOES NOT

07:00:13.288 --> 07:00:16.491
PROTECT ITS PUBLIC SERVANTS.

07:00:16.558 --> 07:00:18.526
PLEASE LAY OFF OF THIS THING,

07:00:18.593 --> 07:00:21.863
PLEASE. THANK YOU SO MANY.

07:00:21.930 --> 07:00:22.463
MEMBER LACKEY, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

07:00:22.530 --> 07:00:25.767
KALRA, YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

07:00:25.833 --> 07:00:28.036
THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. I RISE

07:00:28.102 --> 07:00:31.539
TODAY AS A COAUTHOR IN SUPPORT

07:00:31.606 --> 07:00:33.074
OF THIS BILL. AS WE'VE HEARD

07:00:33.141 --> 07:00:34.375
YESTERDAY, SIX REPUBLICAN

07:00:34.442 --> 07:00:36.578
APPOINTEES TO THE U.S. SUPREME

07:00:36.644 --> 07:00:37.078
COURT EFFECTIVELY UPHELD

07:00:37.145 --> 07:00:39.113
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S BID TO

07:00:39.180 --> 07:00:40.415
RACIALLY PROFILE THE LATINO AND

07:00:40.481 --> 07:00:43.484
ASIAN COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA.

07:00:43.551 --> 07:00:44.986
THE REPUBLICAN APPOINTEES SAID

07:00:45.053 --> 07:00:47.121
THAT ICE AND BORDER CONTROL

07:00:47.188 --> 07:00:50.291
AGENTS MAY CONTINUE TO. JUST A

07:00:50.358 --> 07:00:52.760
MOMENT, MR. KALRA. ASSEMBLY

07:00:52.827 --> 07:00:54.729
MEMBER PATTERSON YES. MR.

THE FLOOR. MEMBERS. YOUR POINT

07:01:00.635 --> 07:01:02.270
IS WELL TAKEN. THERE REALLY

07:01:02.337 --> 07:01:04.038
ISN'T A RULE OF THE HOUSE, BUT

07:01:04.105 --> 07:01:06.774
IT'S JUST A MEANS OF RESPECT.

07:01:06.841 --> 07:01:09.010
IF YOU COULD KEEP PARTIES OUT

07:01:09.077 --> 07:01:10.345
OF THIS, MR. KALRA, THAT WOULD

07:01:10.411 --> 07:01:12.714
BE HELPFUL. REFER TO THE OTHER

07:01:12.780 --> 07:01:13.615
SIDE OF THE AISLE, PLEASE.

07:01:13.681 --> 07:01:17.051
THANK YOU. WELL. THE THOSE

07:01:17.118 --> 07:01:19.153
APPOINTED BY THE OTHER SIDE OF

07:01:19.220 --> 07:01:20.421
THE AISLE SAID THAT ICE AND

07:01:20.488 --> 07:01:23.157
BORDER CONTROL AGENTS MAY

07:01:23.224 --> 07:01:25.226
CONTAIN MAY CONTINUE THEIR

07:01:25.293 --> 07:01:26.094
REIGN OF TERROR WHERE MASKED

07:01:26.160 --> 07:01:28.496
AGENTS WORK AS ANONYMOUS GANGS

07:01:28.563 --> 07:01:30.264
JUMPING OUT OF UNMARKED CARS,

07:01:30.331 --> 07:01:31.499
SLAMMING PEOPLE TO THE GROUND,

07:01:31.566 --> 07:01:32.233
THROWING THEM INTO VEHICLES,

07:01:32.300 --> 07:01:34.602
DETAINING THEM WITHOUT DUE

07:01:34.669 --> 07:01:35.203
PROCESS AND WITHOUT ACCESS TO

07:01:35.269 --> 07:01:36.204
ATTORNEYS OR FAMILIES.

07:01:36.270 --> 07:01:38.272
DEPORTING THEM TO COUNTRIES

07:01:38.339 --> 07:01:40.008
THAT HAVE NOTORIOUS RECORDS OF

07:01:40.074 --> 07:01:41.142
HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES. THAT IS

07:01:41.209 --> 07:01:45.079
NOT AMERICAN. AND THESE ARE NOT

07:01:45.146 --> 07:01:46.614
EXAGGERATIONS. WE'VE SEEN IT

07:01:46.681 --> 07:01:48.316
EVERY DAY, IN EVERY CORNER OF

07:01:48.383 --> 07:01:50.485
OUR NATION. THESE ABUSES HAVE

07:01:50.551 --> 07:01:51.352
BEEN VISITED ON HUNDREDS OF

07:01:51.419 --> 07:01:53.321
INNOCENT PEOPLE, INCLUDING A

07:01:53.388 --> 07:01:55.089
MIDDLE AGED AND OLDER GARDENER,

07:01:55.156 --> 07:01:57.992
DAY LABORERS OUTSIDE HOME DEPOT

07:01:58.059 --> 07:02:00.261
AND, AS WE KNOW, A LABOR LEADER

07:02:00.328 --> 07:02:01.729
IN CALIFORNIA, OUR SEIU

07:02:01.796 --> 07:02:03.064
PRESIDENT DAVID HUERTA, WHO WAS

07:02:03.131 --> 07:02:04.265
SLAMMED TO THE GROUND, ARRESTED

07:02:04.332 --> 07:02:06.100
AND CHARGED WITH A FELONY THAT

07:02:06.167 --> 07:02:08.002
CARRIES UP TO SIX YEARS IN

07:02:08.069 --> 07:02:10.271
PRISON, DAVID HUERTA DID NOT

07:02:10.338 --> 07:02:11.372
IMPEDE OFFICERS. IN FACT, NONE

07:02:11.439 --> 07:02:12.373
OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND MANY

07:02:12.440 --> 07:02:15.009
OF THE HUNDREDS OF OTHERS THAT

07:02:15.076 --> 07:02:16.544
HAVE BEEN ABDUCTED WERE GUILTY

07:02:16.611 --> 07:02:18.112
OF ANYTHING. WELL, THEY

07:02:18.179 --> 07:02:20.415
ACTUALLY, I GUESS, WERE

07:02:20.481 --> 07:02:22.050
UNSUSPECTINGLY GUILTY OF WHAT

07:02:22.116 --> 07:02:23.584
MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE

07:02:23.651 --> 07:02:25.119
GUILTY OF. BROWN SKIN, DARK

07:02:25.186 --> 07:02:28.356
HAIR AND BROWN EYES. THIS IS

07:02:28.423 --> 07:02:30.124
WHAT THE US SUPREME COURT

07:02:30.191 --> 07:02:31.459
MAJORITY SANCTIONED YESTERDAY

07:02:31.526 --> 07:02:33.895
RACIAL PROFILING, HARASSMENT OF

07:02:33.961 --> 07:02:35.196
OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, AND

07:02:35.263 --> 07:02:37.465
RENDITION. RENDITION BY MASKED

07:02:37.532 --> 07:02:39.067
THUGS. LOOK AT WHAT IS

07:02:39.133 --> 07:02:40.668
HAPPENING IN OUR STATE, AROUND

07:02:40.735 --> 07:02:42.370
OUR COUNTRY, THE TARGETING OF

07:02:42.437 --> 07:02:43.438
OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY, THEIR

07:02:43.504 --> 07:02:44.639
TARGETING OF OUR LATINO

07:02:44.706 --> 07:02:46.040
COMMUNITY BY MASKED MEN. DON'T

07:02:46.107 --> 07:02:50.578
BE BLIND TO THIS INJUSTICE. SB

07:02:50.645 --> 07:02:53.147
627 IS A TOOL WE NEED IN

07:02:53.214 --> 07:02:54.348
CALIFORNIA TO UNMASK THESE BAD

07:02:54.415 --> 07:02:55.950
ACTORS AND HOLD THEM

07:02:56.017 --> 07:02:57.151
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ABUSES

07:02:57.218 --> 07:02:59.921
AND DETER ABUSES BY OTHERS. THE

07:02:59.987 --> 07:03:02.690
BILL ALSO PREVENTS ANY LOCAL

07:03:02.757 --> 07:03:03.958
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS FROM

07:03:04.025 --> 07:03:05.426
EMULATING EMULATING THIS

07:03:05.493 --> 07:03:07.061
HORRIBLE BEHAVIOR, AND THE

07:03:07.128 --> 07:03:08.629
OPPOSITION IS FOCUSED ON A

07:03:08.696 --> 07:03:09.997
PROVISION THAT PROVIDES A

07:03:10.064 --> 07:03:12.467
MINIMUM PAYMENT TO A VICTIM OF

07:03:12.533 --> 07:03:14.402
ABUSE OF $10,000 AND ON THE

07:03:14.469 --> 07:03:16.237
IMMUNITY. SO I WANT TO ADDRESS

07:03:16.304 --> 07:03:18.906
THAT. THE TRUTH IS, AS APPLIES

07:03:18.973 --> 07:03:21.275
TO THE $10,000, THAT IS A

07:03:21.342 --> 07:03:22.944
PENALTY THAT ONLY APPLIES TO

07:03:23.010 --> 07:03:24.212
THOSE WHO THE COURT FINDS

07:03:24.278 --> 07:03:26.481
VIOLATED THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF A

07:03:26.547 --> 07:03:28.049
PERSON PURSUANT TO STATE AND

07:03:28.116 --> 07:03:31.285
FEDERAL LAWS THAT EXIST TODAY.

07:03:31.352 --> 07:03:33.421
IT ONLY APPLIES IF A JURY OR A

07:03:33.488 --> 07:03:34.288
JUDGE FINDS ON THE RECORD THAT

07:03:34.355 --> 07:03:36.324
AN OFFICER COMMITTED ONE OF THE

07:03:36.390 --> 07:03:38.726
SIX ACTS COVERED BY THE FEDERAL

07:03:38.793 --> 07:03:40.361
TORT CLAIMS ACT OF 1946 ASSAULT,

07:03:40.428 --> 07:03:42.029
BATTERY, FALSE IMPRISONMENT,

07:03:42.096 --> 07:03:44.832
FALSE ARREST, ABUSE OF PROCESS,

07:03:44.899 --> 07:03:45.933
OR MALICIOUS PROSECUTION. THESE

07:03:46.000 --> 07:03:47.201
ACTS ARE UNLAWFUL TODAY UNDER

07:03:47.268 --> 07:03:49.937
BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE LAW.

07:03:50.004 --> 07:03:51.172
UNDER THIS BILL, THE SAME

07:03:51.239 --> 07:03:53.207
IMMUNITIES AND LEGAL DEFENSES

07:03:53.274 --> 07:03:54.308
THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO LAW

07:03:54.375 --> 07:03:55.209
ENFORCEMENT TODAY WILL REMAIN

07:03:55.276 --> 07:03:58.379
IN PLACE. HOWEVER, IF ABUSE IS

07:03:58.446 --> 07:04:00.181
FOUND TO BE TRUE BY A COURT OF

07:04:00.248 --> 07:04:02.316
LAW, AND IF THE PERSON WAS

07:04:02.383 --> 07:04:05.119
MASKED IN A KNOWING AND WILLFUL

07:04:05.186 --> 07:04:07.688
MANNER WITH INTENT TO DEFY

07:04:07.755 --> 07:04:09.090
STATE LAWS AND AVOID

07:04:09.157 --> 07:04:11.225
ACCOUNTABILITY, THEN THE

07:04:11.292 --> 07:04:14.028
MINIMUM FINE OF $10,000 WOULD

07:04:14.095 --> 07:04:17.098
BE PAID TO THE VICTIM. DON'T

07:04:17.165 --> 07:04:19.200
BELIEVE THE HYPE ON ALL THIS OR

07:04:19.267 --> 07:04:20.334
QUALIFIED IMMUNITY IS GOING

07:04:20.401 --> 07:04:22.670
AWAY, WHAT HAVE YOU. WE ARE

07:04:22.737 --> 07:04:23.137
RIGHT NOW IN AN URGENT

07:04:23.204 --> 07:04:25.106
SITUATION AND WE MUST TAKE

07:04:25.173 --> 07:04:27.675
ACTION TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITY.

07:04:27.742 --> 07:04:29.410
AND MOST POLICE OFFICERS ARE

07:04:29.477 --> 07:04:32.079
NOT GOING TO MASK THEMSELVES.

07:04:32.146 --> 07:04:33.881
THEY ARE GOING TO ABIDE BY THE

07:04:33.948 --> 07:04:35.416
BY BUILDING TRUST IN THEIR

07:04:35.483 --> 07:04:36.284
COMMUNITY. THIS IS FOR THOSE

07:04:36.350 --> 07:04:40.021
THAT WANT TO ABUSE AND JOIN

07:04:40.087 --> 07:04:41.656
FEDERAL AGENTS AND ABUSING THE

07:04:41.722 --> 07:04:44.025
COMMUNITY. THE EFFECT OF SB 627

07:04:44.091 --> 07:04:46.460
IS TO PROTECT PEOPLE WHO LIVE

07:04:46.527 --> 07:04:47.295
IN CALIFORNIA FROM CIVIL RIGHTS

07:04:47.361 --> 07:04:48.963
ABUSES AND VIOLENCE. IT DOES SO

07:04:49.030 --> 07:04:50.198
BY REQUIRING AGENCIES TO

07:04:50.264 --> 07:04:51.432
DEVELOP POLICIES THAT PROVIDE

07:04:51.499 --> 07:04:53.501
FOR REASONABLE RULES ABOUT WHEN,

07:04:53.568 --> 07:04:55.369
TO, WHERE AND WHEN NOT TO WEAR

07:04:55.436 --> 07:04:58.172
A MASK. IF AN OFFICER, LOCAL OR

07:04:58.239 --> 07:04:59.473
FEDERAL, ADHERE TO THESE

07:04:59.540 --> 07:05:01.142
POLICIES, THEY HAVE NO PROBLEM.

07:05:01.209 --> 07:05:03.411
SO I ASK OUR COLLEAGUES,

07:05:03.477 --> 07:05:05.213
ESPECIALLY THOSE ON THE OTHER

07:05:05.279 --> 07:05:07.081
SIDE OF THE AISLE, WHO CLAIM TO

07:05:07.148 --> 07:05:10.618
CARE ABOUT OUR LATINO COMMUNITY.

07:05:10.685 --> 07:05:12.486
DON'T BE BLINDED BY THE WHIMS

07:05:12.553 --> 07:05:14.188
OF A PRESIDENT WHO CONTINUES TO

07:05:14.255 --> 07:05:17.158
DIVIDE US. TAKE THE MASK OFF OF

07:05:17.225 --> 07:05:19.594
YOUR EYES AND OPEN YOUR HEART

07:05:19.660 --> 07:05:21.095
TO THE PAIN, SUFFERING, AND

07:05:21.162 --> 07:05:25.333
CONFUSION AND THE CONFUSION

07:05:25.399 --> 07:05:27.335
THAT SO MANY OF OUR FAMILIES

07:05:27.401 --> 07:05:29.971
ARE SUFFERING THROUGH IN YOUR

07:05:30.037 --> 07:05:33.708
COMMUNITIES. AND I URGE YOU TO

07:05:33.774 --> 07:05:36.878
VOTE YES ON SB 627. THANK YOU.

07:05:36.944 --> 07:05:39.046
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. KALRA.

07:05:39.113 --> 07:05:40.681
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. BENNETT, YOU

07:05:40.748 --> 07:05:43.017
ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY

07:05:43.084 --> 07:05:46.153
MUCH, MR. SPEAKER. WE'RE ALL

07:05:46.220 --> 07:05:48.055
SPEAKING A LOT HERE TODAY, AND

07:05:48.122 --> 07:05:49.423
I'M JUST GOING TO ASK EVERYBODY

07:05:49.490 --> 07:05:51.058
WHO MAYBE IS HAS TURNED OFF FOR

07:05:51.125 --> 07:05:54.495
A SECOND IF YOU COULD JUST

07:05:54.562 --> 07:05:55.730
LISTEN TO THIS ONE QUESTION

07:05:55.796 --> 07:05:59.200
THAT I HAVE. WHAT IF LAST

07:05:59.267 --> 07:06:02.770
NIGHT'S SUPREME COURT RULING

07:06:02.837 --> 07:06:06.173
APPLIED RATHER THAN TO THE

07:06:06.240 --> 07:06:09.677
PEOPLE OF COLOR IN OUR COUNTRY,

07:06:09.744 --> 07:06:11.879
IT APPLIED TO PEOPLE THAT LOOK

07:06:11.946 --> 07:06:15.216
LIKE ME. STOP AND THINK ABOUT

07:06:15.283 --> 07:06:17.718
THAT FOR A MOMENT. WHAT WOULD

07:06:17.785 --> 07:06:20.054
BE THE REACTION IN AMERICA IF

07:06:20.121 --> 07:06:22.356
PEOPLE LIKE ME COULD BE STOPPED

07:06:22.423 --> 07:06:24.992
AND ASKED FOR MY DOCUMENTS FOR

07:06:25.059 --> 07:06:29.063
JUST WALKING DOWN THE STREET?

07:06:29.130 --> 07:06:32.166
WE ARE AT, AND VERY DANGEROUSLY

07:06:32.233 --> 07:06:35.202
CLOSE TO, PASSING A TIPPING

07:06:35.269 --> 07:06:38.072
POINT IN AMERICA, A TIPPING

07:06:38.139 --> 07:06:41.008
POINT THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE

07:06:41.075 --> 07:06:44.645
TO COME BACK FROM ONCE WE GET

07:06:44.712 --> 07:06:47.515
TOO FAR DOWN THE ROAD. SO THIS

07:06:47.581 --> 07:06:50.318
EFFORT BY ICE TO MASK

07:06:50.384 --> 07:06:53.955
THEMSELVES UP IS NOT JUST FOR

07:06:54.021 --> 07:06:57.525
THEIR PROTECTION FROM PEOPLE

07:06:57.591 --> 07:06:59.360
IDENTIFYING THEM, BUT IT IS

07:06:59.427 --> 07:07:03.531
ALSO PART OF AN OVERALL PLAN TO

07:07:03.597 --> 07:07:05.166
INTIMIDATE, INTIMIDATE PEOPLE

07:07:05.232 --> 07:07:08.069
IN THIS COUNTRY AND FOR THE

07:07:08.135 --> 07:07:10.571
MILITARIZATION OF CIVILIAN LIFE

07:07:10.638 --> 07:07:12.373
IN THIS COUNTRY. AND THAT IS

07:07:12.440 --> 07:07:15.943
ALL PART OF THE NORMAL STRATEGY

07:07:16.010 --> 07:07:17.311
OF AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNMENTS

07:07:17.378 --> 07:07:20.815
THAT ARE TRYING TO TAKE OVER

07:07:20.881 --> 07:07:25.186
DEMOCRACIES. SO THIS BILL THAT

07:07:25.252 --> 07:07:27.121
WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US, WE HAVE

07:07:27.188 --> 07:07:29.290
TO WEIGH IT ON ITS MERITS, AND

07:07:29.357 --> 07:07:32.093
IT HAS SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS IN

07:07:32.159 --> 07:07:35.329
TERMS OF SENDING A MESSAGE,

07:07:35.396 --> 07:07:37.631
WHETHER AND REGARDLESS OF YOUR

07:07:37.698 --> 07:07:39.967
LEGAL VIEW OF HOW ENFORCEABLE

07:07:40.034 --> 07:07:42.236
IT MAY OR MAY NOT BE, IT SENDS

07:07:42.303 --> 07:07:44.005
A MESSAGE THAT'S IMPORTANT TO

07:07:44.071 --> 07:07:47.141
SEND RIGHT NOW THAT WE ARE

07:07:47.208 --> 07:07:49.276
DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO

07:07:49.343 --> 07:07:51.412
MILITARIZING CIVILIAN LIFE.

07:07:51.479 --> 07:07:52.980
WE'RE DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO

07:07:53.047 --> 07:07:56.517
PASSING TIPPING POINTS THAT MAY

07:07:56.584 --> 07:07:59.120
DENY EVEN OUR ABILITY TO TURN

07:07:59.186 --> 07:08:02.656
US BACK TO MORE DEMOCRATIC WAYS.

07:08:02.723 --> 07:08:05.793
I, WHEN I SAW THE QUALIFIED

07:08:05.860 --> 07:08:09.463
IMMUNITY IN THIS BILL, I AND MY

07:08:09.530 --> 07:08:11.399
STAFF, WE HAVE SPENT DOZENS OF

07:08:11.465 --> 07:08:14.168
HOURS TRYING TO ANALYZE THAT.

07:08:14.235 --> 07:08:17.071
AND THE REASON BEING IS IT IS

07:08:17.138 --> 07:08:20.141
ICE THAT IS PARTICIPATING IN

07:08:20.207 --> 07:08:21.175
THIS MILITARIZATION. AND WE

07:08:21.242 --> 07:08:24.245
HAVE MANY WELL-INTENTIONED

07:08:24.311 --> 07:08:27.181
LOCAL POLICE OFFICERS THAT ARE

07:08:27.248 --> 07:08:28.549
LEGITIMATELY CONCERNED ABOUT

07:08:28.616 --> 07:08:30.251
THIS QUALIFIED IMMUNITY

07:08:30.317 --> 07:08:32.653
PROVISION HERE. AND I WOULD

07:08:32.720 --> 07:08:34.221
JUST OFFER IN THE SHORT PERIOD

07:08:34.288 --> 07:08:36.290
OF TIME, A FEW DAYS, THAT I'VE

07:08:36.357 --> 07:08:38.526
HAD TO LOOK AT QUALIFIED

07:08:38.592 --> 07:08:41.295
IMMUNITY. I DON'T BELIEVE IT IS

07:08:41.362 --> 07:08:44.065
AS SERIOUS A THREAT AS IT

07:08:44.131 --> 07:08:45.800
LOOKED LIKE AT THE BEGINNING.

07:08:45.866 --> 07:08:48.102
AS MY COLLEAGUE POINTED OUT,

07:08:48.169 --> 07:08:52.339
IT'S FOR EGREGIOUS BEHAVIOR AND

07:08:52.406 --> 07:08:54.141
EGREGIOUS BEHAVIOR ALREADY. YOU

07:08:54.208 --> 07:08:58.079
LOSE YOUR QUALIFIED IMMUNITY. I

07:08:58.145 --> 07:09:01.449
WANT US TO BE SENSITIVE AND

07:09:01.515 --> 07:09:04.485
CAREFUL OF THE WELL INTENTIONED

07:09:04.552 --> 07:09:07.154
LOCAL POLICE OFFICERS WHO DO

07:09:07.221 --> 07:09:08.956
NOT SUPPORT ICE AND THEIR

07:09:09.023 --> 07:09:11.292
MASKING EFFORTS, WHO RECOGNIZE

07:09:11.358 --> 07:09:13.494
THAT WHEN THEY ARE ENGAGING IN

07:09:13.561 --> 07:09:16.163
THOSE MASKING EFFORTS, THEY'RE

07:09:16.230 --> 07:09:18.299
REDUCING THE PUBLIC'S TRUST IN

07:09:18.365 --> 07:09:20.101
THE LOCAL POLICE FORCES AT THE

07:09:20.167 --> 07:09:22.970
SAME TIME. BUT IN TERMS OF

07:09:23.037 --> 07:09:25.072
WEIGHING THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE

07:09:25.139 --> 07:09:26.974
QUALIFIED IMMUNITY AND THE

07:09:27.041 --> 07:09:29.210
ENORMITY OF THE TIPPING POINT

07:09:29.276 --> 07:09:31.979
THAT WE ARE AT, THERE IS NO

07:09:32.046 --> 07:09:34.482
QUESTION THAT WE SHOULD SUPPORT

07:09:34.548 --> 07:09:36.951
THIS BILL AND WE SHOULD SEND A

07:09:37.017 --> 07:09:40.321
STRONG MESSAGE AS WE CAN, THAT

07:09:40.387 --> 07:09:42.957
WE NEED TO STAND UP IN EVERY

07:09:43.023 --> 07:09:45.259
WAY POSSIBLE AGAINST THE

07:09:45.326 --> 07:09:47.461
MILITARIZATION OF OUR CIVILIAN

07:09:47.528 --> 07:09:49.997
LIFE, AGAINST THE ICE AGENTS,

07:09:50.064 --> 07:09:52.433
INTENTIONALLY TRYING TO

07:09:52.500 --> 07:09:55.469
INTIMIDATE SOCIETY AND

07:09:55.536 --> 07:09:58.305
INTIMIDATE ALL OF US TO NOT

07:09:58.372 --> 07:10:00.107
RESIST. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR

07:10:00.174 --> 07:10:03.244

AND RECOGNIZE TWO FOLKS THAT

07:10:12.186 --> 07:10:15.189
HAVE THAT ARE NO STRANGERS TO A

07:10:15.256 --> 07:10:16.924
TOUGH FLOOR DEBATE. WE ARE IN

07:10:16.991 --> 07:10:18.259
THE COMPANY OF TWO FORMER

07:10:18.325 --> 07:10:20.694
SPEAKERS HERE, FORMER SPEAKER

07:10:20.761 --> 07:10:21.996

ACKNOWLEDGE OUR COLLEAGUE FROM

07:11:07.541 --> 07:11:10.411
PALMDALE. I ALWAYS PAY SPECIAL

07:11:10.477 --> 07:11:12.213
ATTENTION TO HIS COMMENTS

07:11:12.279 --> 07:11:13.380
BECAUSE HE COMES FROM THE

07:11:13.447 --> 07:11:15.149
PERSPECTIVE OF A FORMER LAW

07:11:15.216 --> 07:11:17.451
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER, AND I WANT

07:11:17.518 --> 07:11:21.422
TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT, YOU KNOW,

07:11:21.488 --> 07:11:25.226
I'VE I'VE ALWAYS SUPPORTED LAW

07:11:25.292 --> 07:11:26.594
ENFORCEMENT. I'VE NEVER BEEN

07:11:26.660 --> 07:11:28.429
ONE OF THE DEMOCRATS THAT HAS

07:11:28.495 --> 07:11:29.263
BEEN CALLING FOR DEFUNDING THE

07:11:29.330 --> 07:11:32.066
POLICE. AND I HAVE ALWAYS

07:11:32.132 --> 07:11:33.200
SUPPORTED MY LOCAL LAW

07:11:33.267 --> 07:11:35.436
ENFORCEMENT, AND I HAVE ALWAYS

07:11:35.502 --> 07:11:37.104
BELIEVED THAT THE VAST,

07:11:37.171 --> 07:11:39.073
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF ALL

07:11:39.139 --> 07:11:40.341
LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE GOOD,

07:11:40.407 --> 07:11:42.443
HARDWORKING, HONEST PEOPLE THAT

07:11:42.509 --> 07:11:46.013
ARE TRYING TO DO A TOUGH JOB.

07:11:46.080 --> 07:11:49.283
AND SO I RESPECT THE WORK OF

07:11:49.350 --> 07:11:52.286
LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND I RESPECT

07:11:52.353 --> 07:11:53.988
THE IMPORTANCE OF QUALIFIED

07:11:54.054 --> 07:11:56.156
IMMUNITY. I ALSO WANT TO

07:11:56.223 --> 07:11:57.791
ACKNOWLEDGE THE ARGUMENTS. I'M

07:11:57.858 --> 07:12:00.027
LOOKING AT THE PORAC ANALYSIS

07:12:00.094 --> 07:12:03.430
ON THEIR CONCERNS, AND I WANT

07:12:03.497 --> 07:12:07.568
TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR PRIMARY

07:12:07.635 --> 07:12:11.272
MESSAGE THAT THE CALIFORNIA

07:12:11.338 --> 07:12:13.040
LEGISLATURE HAS A VERY LIMITED

07:12:13.107 --> 07:12:14.174
ABILITY TO IMPACT FEDERAL

07:12:14.241 --> 07:12:15.943
ACTIONS, AND THAT THE

07:12:16.010 --> 07:12:17.611
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THE

07:12:17.678 --> 07:12:21.348
IMPACTS OF SB 627 WILL FALL ON

07:12:21.415 --> 07:12:26.687
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. I AGREE.

07:12:26.754 --> 07:12:28.322
NORMALLY I WOULD OPPOSE THIS

07:12:28.389 --> 07:12:33.294
BILL, BUT WE ARE NOT IN NORMAL

07:12:33.360 --> 07:12:40.367
TIMES. WE ARE SEEING A FASCIST

07:12:40.434 --> 07:12:43.804
PRESIDENT WHO IS MILITARIZING

07:12:43.871 --> 07:12:46.607
LAW ENFORCEMENT, SENDING THEM

07:12:46.674 --> 07:12:48.342
INTO COMMUNITIES FOR POLITICAL

07:12:48.409 --> 07:12:52.946
PURPOSES TO WAGE THIS CAMPAIGN

07:12:53.013 --> 07:12:55.849
OF FEAR AGAINST OUR IMMIGRANT

07:12:55.916 --> 07:12:59.553
COMMUNITIES. AND SO WHILE I WAS

07:12:59.620 --> 07:13:01.388
GOING BACK AND FORTH ON THIS

07:13:01.455 --> 07:13:07.061
BILL, I HAVE TO COME DOWN AS AS

07:13:07.127 --> 07:13:11.999
MUCH AS I AGREE THAT THE

07:13:12.066 --> 07:13:14.301
PROBLEM IS WITH THE FEDERAL LAW

07:13:14.368 --> 07:13:16.970
ENFORCEMENT, IT IS NOT WITH OUR

07:13:17.037 --> 07:13:22.242
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. AS MUCH

07:13:22.309 --> 07:13:25.079
AS I AGREE WITH THAT, WE NEED

07:13:25.145 --> 07:13:27.614
TO SEND A MESSAGE THAT WE

07:13:27.681 --> 07:13:32.853
CANNOT STAND SILENT WHILE THIS

07:13:32.920 --> 07:13:35.422
FASCIST PRESIDENT IS CONTINUING

07:13:35.489 --> 07:13:37.925
TO MILITARIZE AND SPREAD THIS

07:13:37.991 --> 07:13:39.393
CAMPAIGN OF FEAR IN OUR

07:13:39.460 --> 07:13:41.595
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. AND FOR

07:13:41.662 --> 07:13:43.230
THAT REASON, AND FOR THAT

07:13:43.297 --> 07:13:45.733
REASON ONLY, I WILL BE

07:13:45.799 --> 07:13:48.435

THE CONTEXT IN WHICH THIS BILL

07:14:04.785 --> 07:14:08.389
IS BEING RAISED. PROFOUND

07:14:08.455 --> 07:14:12.059
TERROR, PROFOUND TERROR IS WHAT

07:14:12.126 --> 07:14:13.927
OUR COMMUNITIES ARE

07:14:13.994 --> 07:14:16.029
EXPERIENCING RIGHT NOW. THE

07:14:16.096 --> 07:14:17.264
RECENT FEDERAL OPERATIONS IN

07:14:17.331 --> 07:14:18.966
CALIFORNIA HAVE CREATED AN

07:14:19.032 --> 07:14:21.435
ENVIRONMENT OF ABSOLUTE,

07:14:21.502 --> 07:14:25.072
PROFOUND TERROR WITH OUR POLICE

07:14:25.139 --> 07:14:29.076

TRUST THAT THEY WORK SO HARD TO

07:14:32.746 --> 07:14:36.150
GAIN IN OUR COMMUNITIES. WHEN

07:14:36.216 --> 07:14:41.188
WE WEAR, WHEN THEY WEAR MASKS

07:14:41.255 --> 07:14:44.558
THAT ARE ESSENTIALLY SKI MASKS,

07:14:44.625 --> 07:14:46.260
NOT IDENTIFYING THEMSELVES.

07:14:46.326 --> 07:14:49.096
WHEN PEOPLE GRAB PEOPLE OFF OF

07:14:49.163 --> 07:14:51.064
THE STREETS INTO UNMARKED CARS

07:14:51.131 --> 07:14:54.802

07:14:54.868 --> 07:14:57.438
ABSOLUTELY ERODES THE VERY

07:14:57.504 --> 07:15:02.209
DELICATE AND HARD FOUGHT TRUST

THAT OUR COMMUNITIES SEEK AND

07:15:05.212 --> 07:15:08.315

SUFFERING AND ARE NOT HEALED

07:15:33.173 --> 07:15:35.642
BECAUSE OF THOSE POLICE

07:15:35.709 --> 07:15:36.877
ENGAGEMENTS AND BECAUSE OF

07:15:36.944 --> 07:15:40.314
THOSE KILLINGS AND MANY MORE. I

LOVED THEIR COMMUNITIES. I

ATTENDED THEIR FUNERALS. I

07:15:55.362 --> 07:15:58.298
SPOKE TO THEIR FAMILIES. THEY

07:15:58.365 --> 07:16:00.667
LIVED IN SERVICE OF THEIR

07:16:00.734 --> 07:16:02.269
COMMUNITIES, AND THEY WERE

07:16:02.336 --> 07:16:08.242
TAKEN. FROM VIOLENCE. THIS

07:16:08.308 --> 07:16:11.178
CAMPAIGN OF TERROR THAT WE ARE

07:16:11.245 --> 07:16:14.414

FIGHT SO HARD FOR IS NOT

07:16:29.696 --> 07:16:31.565
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE

07:16:31.632 --> 07:16:36.236
OKAY WITH. NOT AT ALL. THE

ACTUALLY DOES. LET'S PURSUE THE

07:18:26.947 --> 07:18:28.081
TRUTH IN THIS CONVERSATION. THE

FACIAL COVERING PROHIBITION.

07:18:50.270 --> 07:18:51.371
HOWEVER, THIS IS SOMETHING

07:18:51.438 --> 07:18:52.873
WE'RE NOT TALKING NEARLY ENOUGH

07:18:52.939 --> 07:18:55.075

07:19:05.252 --> 07:19:06.053
DON'T JUST TAKE MY WORD FOR

07:19:06.119 --> 07:19:07.954
THAT. IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE

07:19:08.021 --> 07:19:09.222

07:19:09.289 --> 07:19:10.557

07:19:10.624 --> 07:19:12.292
CHANGES TO PENAL CODE SECTION

07:19:12.359 --> 07:19:15.362

IN FRONT OF US ALL. THIS BILL

07:19:18.298 --> 07:19:20.333

07:19:23.370 --> 07:19:26.006
VIOLATES OUR VALUES AND CREATES

07:19:26.073 --> 07:19:27.207
A POWERFUL INCENTIVE FOR LAW

07:19:27.274 --> 07:19:28.375
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO

07:19:28.442 --> 07:19:30.010
REGULATE THIS CONDUCT AND

07:19:30.077 --> 07:19:31.178
PREVENT IT FROM BECOMING

07:19:31.244 --> 07:19:33.246
NORMALIZED AND COMMONPLACE. NOW,

07:19:33.313 --> 07:19:35.348
THE BILL ALSO PROVIDES CIVIL

07:19:35.415 --> 07:19:36.116
DAMAGES AGAINST ANYONE WHO

07:19:36.183 --> 07:19:38.418

OF THE BILL. THAT'S A MOUTHFUL,

07:19:50.197 --> 07:19:51.431
BUT THAT IS A VERY HIGH

07:19:51.498 --> 07:19:53.133
STANDARD, AS I'M GOING TO

07:19:53.200 --> 07:19:55.569
EXPLAIN UNDER THE LAW. LET'S BE

07:19:55.635 --> 07:19:56.403

07:19:56.470 --> 07:19:58.138
MEANS TO SUCCEED IN A TORT

07:19:58.205 --> 07:19:59.239

07:20:10.417 --> 07:20:12.152
EXAMPLE, ASSAULT AND FALSE

07:20:12.219 --> 07:20:14.287
IMPRISONMENT BOTH HINGE ON THE

07:20:14.354 --> 07:20:16.123
ABSENCE OF LAWFUL AUTHORITY,

07:20:16.189 --> 07:20:18.191
WHEREAS BATTERY REQUIRES PROOF

07:20:18.258 --> 07:20:20.127
OF UNREASONABLE FORCE. AND BY

07:20:20.193 --> 07:20:22.129
THE WAY, THEY'RE WEARING A MASK

07:20:22.195 --> 07:20:23.263
WHEN THEY'RE DOING ALL OF THIS

07:20:23.330 --> 07:20:25.632

THERE'S NO WARRANT OR AN

07:20:30.103 --> 07:20:31.271
INVALID WARRANT IF THERE IS ONE.

07:20:31.338 --> 07:20:33.273
EVEN THEN, AN OFFICER MUST

07:20:33.340 --> 07:20:34.241
AVOID MAY AVOID LIABILITY BY

07:20:34.307 --> 07:20:36.343
PROVING THAT THEY ACTED IN GOOD

07:20:36.409 --> 07:20:38.211
FAITH BASED ON A REASONABLE

07:20:38.278 --> 07:20:39.346
BELIEF IN THE WARRANT'S

07:20:39.412 --> 07:20:41.348
VALIDITY. WHAT'S MORE, UNDER

07:20:41.414 --> 07:20:43.450
THIS BILL, THE TERMS WILLFUL

07:20:43.517 --> 07:20:44.284
MEAN THE OFFICER DELIBERATELY

07:20:44.351 --> 07:20:46.219
WORE THE FACIAL COVERING, AND

07:20:46.286 --> 07:20:47.120
THE TERM KNOWING MEANS THAT THE

07:20:47.187 --> 07:20:49.156
OFFICER WAS AWARE, OR SHOULD

07:20:49.222 --> 07:20:50.056
HAVE BEEN AWARE THAT DOING SO

07:20:50.123 --> 07:20:52.092
WAS UNLAWFUL. THAT IS AN

07:20:52.159 --> 07:20:52.692
INCREDIBLY HEIGHTENED STANDARD

07:20:52.759 --> 07:20:54.261
UNDER THE LAW, AND THIS

07:20:54.327 --> 07:20:55.829
HEIGHTENED LEVEL OF INTENT GOES

07:20:55.896 --> 07:20:57.130
BEYOND MERE NEGLIGENCE OR

07:20:57.197 --> 07:20:59.266
RECKLESSNESS. MORE IMPORTANTLY,

07:20:59.332 --> 07:21:00.100
A GOOD FAITH BELIEF THAT

07:21:00.167 --> 07:21:02.435
WEARING A MASK WAS LEGAL, EVEN

07:21:02.502 --> 07:21:04.004
IF MISTAKEN, CAN DEFEAT A

07:21:04.070 --> 07:21:06.373
FINDING OF WILLFUL AND KNOWING

07:21:06.439 --> 07:21:08.208
BEHAVIOR. NOW, IF THE PLAINTIFF

07:21:08.275 --> 07:21:09.042
HAS CARRIED THEIR BURDEN AND

07:21:09.109 --> 07:21:10.277
THE OFFICER'S DEFENSE HAVE

07:21:10.343 --> 07:21:12.112
FAILED, AND A JURY OR JUDGE

07:21:12.179 --> 07:21:14.014
FIND THAT THE OFFICER HAS NOT

07:21:14.080 --> 07:21:15.148
ONLY COMMITTED ONE OF THE

07:21:15.215 --> 07:21:16.383
COVERED TORTS I TALKED ABOUT,

07:21:16.449 --> 07:21:17.918
SUCH AS ASSAULT, BUT THAT THEY

07:21:17.984 --> 07:21:19.686
ALSO WORE A MASK IN WILLFUL AND

07:21:19.753 --> 07:21:21.154
KNOWING VIOLATION. THEN AND

07:21:21.221 --> 07:21:22.122
ONLY THEN, THE OFFICER IS

07:21:22.189 --> 07:21:23.990
SUBJECT TO A PRESUMED DAMAGES

07:21:24.057 --> 07:21:26.359
OF $10,000. THIS AMOUNT, I

07:21:26.426 --> 07:21:27.494
WOULD SUBMIT, REFLECTS THE

07:21:27.561 --> 07:21:29.129
TERRORIZING EFFECT OF AN

07:21:29.196 --> 07:21:30.430
ASSAULT, BATTERY, OR FALSE

07:21:30.497 --> 07:21:32.365
ARREST BEING CARRIED OUT BY A

07:21:32.432 --> 07:21:33.300
MASKED INDIVIDUAL. AND FRANKLY,

07:21:33.366 --> 07:21:35.902
THAT'S A PRETTY MODEST AMOUNT.

07:21:35.969 --> 07:21:37.103
SIGNIFICANTLY, AN OFFICER

07:21:37.170 --> 07:21:38.371
LIABLE FOR THESE DAMAGES

07:21:38.438 --> 07:21:40.273
REMAINS ELIGIBLE FOR

07:21:40.340 --> 07:21:41.374
INDEMNIFICATION FROM THEIR

07:21:41.441 --> 07:21:42.275
EMPLOYING AGENCY, PROVIDED THAT

07:21:42.342 --> 07:21:44.311
THE OFFICER WAS ACTING WITHIN

07:21:44.377 --> 07:21:46.112
THE COURSE AND SCOPE OF THEIR

07:21:46.179 --> 07:21:48.248
OFFICIAL DUTIES. THIS CREATES A

07:21:48.315 --> 07:21:48.982
FURTHER INCENTIVE INCENTIVE FOR

07:21:49.049 --> 07:21:50.584
AGENCIES TO PROPERLY TRAIN

07:21:50.650 --> 07:21:52.319
THEIR OFFICERS ON THE POLICIES

07:21:52.385 --> 07:21:53.987
AND DISCIPLINES APPLICABLE FOR

07:21:54.054 --> 07:21:57.457
VIOLATIONS OF THE LAW. FINALLY,

07:21:57.524 --> 07:22:00.060
SB 627 WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

07:22:00.126 --> 07:22:01.661
IMPACT ON FEDERAL OFFICERS

07:22:01.728 --> 07:22:04.030
WHERE FEDERAL FEDERAL OFFICERS

07:22:04.097 --> 07:22:05.232
HAVE COMMITTED ONE OF THE

07:22:05.298 --> 07:22:06.766
COVERED TORTS THAT I'VE TALKED

07:22:06.833 --> 07:22:08.168
ABOUT TODAY WHILE UNLAWFULLY

07:22:08.235 --> 07:22:10.136
WEARING A MASK IN VIOLATION OF

07:22:10.203 --> 07:22:11.471
THIS BILL, THE VICTIM WOULD BE

07:22:11.538 --> 07:22:13.340
ENTITLED TO FILE A CLAIM

07:22:13.406 --> 07:22:14.307
AGAINST THEM UNDER THE FEDERAL

07:22:14.374 --> 07:22:15.508
AGAINST THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT,

07:22:15.575 --> 07:22:17.177
UNDER THE FEDERAL TORT CLAIMS

07:22:17.244 --> 07:22:19.479
ACT. THAT'S ALREADY THE LAW OF

07:22:19.546 --> 07:22:20.313
THE LAND. UNDER THE FTC, THE

07:22:20.380 --> 07:22:21.581
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS

07:22:21.648 --> 07:22:22.716
EXPRESSLY WAIVED SOVEREIGN

07:22:22.782 --> 07:22:24.317
IMMUNITY FOR THESE SPECIFIC

07:22:24.384 --> 07:22:26.052
TORTS WHEN COMMITTED BY FEDERAL

07:22:26.119 --> 07:22:28.121
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS,

07:22:28.188 --> 07:22:30.490
OFFICERS WILL HAVE PROTECTIONS

07:22:30.557 --> 07:22:32.192
THAT THEY ENJOY TODAY, BUT SO

07:22:32.259 --> 07:22:34.461
WILL THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA

07:22:34.527 --> 07:22:36.730
BEING PROTECTED AGAINST THEM.

07:22:36.796 --> 07:22:38.999
WE NEED THIS BILL, QUITE SIMPLY,

07:22:39.065 --> 07:22:41.034
TO SEND A MESSAGE THAT THE

07:22:41.101 --> 07:22:43.236
UNREGULATED USE OF MASK BY LAW

07:22:43.303 --> 07:22:44.271
ENFORCEMENT IS INCONSISTENT

07:22:44.337 --> 07:22:46.239
WITH OUR VALUES AS A STATE, AND

07:22:46.306 --> 07:22:48.909
TO REIN IN THE USE AND ABUSE OF

07:22:48.975 --> 07:22:50.777
THESE DISGUISES BEFORE IT

07:22:50.844 --> 07:22:52.245
BECOMES COMMONPLACE. IN CLOSING,

07:22:52.312 --> 07:22:53.246
I JUST WANT TO MENTION THIS

07:22:53.313 --> 07:22:55.115
BECAUSE THIS IS ALSO VERY

07:22:55.181 --> 07:22:56.316
IMPORTANT TO THE BILL HAS AN

07:22:56.383 --> 07:22:58.084
INCREDIBLE SPONSORSHIP LIST. IT

07:22:58.151 --> 07:22:59.286
IS SUPPORTED BY THE INLAND

07:22:59.352 --> 07:23:00.520
COALITION FOR IMMIGRANT JUSTICE,

07:23:00.587 --> 07:23:01.955
THE MEXICAN AMERICAN LEGAL

07:23:02.022 --> 07:23:04.224
DEFENSE AND EDUCATION FUND, THE

07:23:04.291 --> 07:23:06.226
PROSECUTORS ALLIANCE FOR ACTION,

07:23:06.293 --> 07:23:08.461
ACLU CALIFORNIA ACTION, ASIAN

07:23:08.528 --> 07:23:09.329
AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE,

07:23:09.396 --> 07:23:10.196
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, BEND THE

07:23:10.263 --> 07:23:12.232
ARC, AND SEIU CALIFORNIA. AND

07:23:12.299 --> 07:23:14.267
IF ALL OF THAT DOESN'T CONVINCE

07:23:14.334 --> 07:23:15.101
YOU, I HOPE THAT WE WILL ALL

07:23:15.168 --> 07:23:17.304
LOOK DEEP WITHIN OUR HEARTS AND

07:23:17.370 --> 07:23:19.506
ASK, WILL WE NOT DO EVERYTHING

07:23:19.572 --> 07:23:21.675
IN OUR POWER TO PREVENT OUR

07:23:21.741 --> 07:23:22.142
COMMUNITIES FROM BEING

07:23:22.208 --> 07:23:23.343
TERRORIZED? WITH THAT, I

07:23:23.410 --> 07:23:25.011
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

07:23:25.078 --> 07:23:26.379
THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

07:23:26.446 --> 07:23:28.448
SCHULTZ. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BRIAN,

07:23:28.515 --> 07:23:30.083
YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU,

07:23:30.150 --> 07:23:31.384
MR. SPEAKER. AND COLLEAGUES, WE

07:23:31.451 --> 07:23:33.253
CANNOT HAVE SECRET POLICE IN

07:23:33.320 --> 07:23:35.088
CALIFORNIA. I THINK, AS MY

07:23:35.155 --> 07:23:36.222
COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES

07:23:36.289 --> 07:23:37.257
POINTED OUT EARLIER, THE

07:23:37.324 --> 07:23:39.092
HYPOCRISY OF THIS DEBATE IS NOT

07:23:39.159 --> 07:23:40.894
LOST ON ME. AS SOMEBODY WHO WAS

07:23:40.961 --> 07:23:43.163
SWORN IN WEARING AN N95 MASK

07:23:43.229 --> 07:23:46.366
BACK IN 2021 FOR NEARLY TWO

07:23:46.433 --> 07:23:47.267
YEARS, MY COLLEAGUES ON THE

07:23:47.334 --> 07:23:49.803
OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE SAID,

07:23:49.869 --> 07:23:52.138
NO MASKS, NO MASKS. NOT TO KEEP

07:23:52.205 --> 07:23:54.541
YOU SAFE, NOT TO PROTECT YOUR

07:23:54.607 --> 07:23:55.942
PUBLIC HEALTH, NOT BECAUSE YOU

07:23:56.009 --> 07:23:57.143
ARE IMMUNE COMPROMISED AND OUT

07:23:57.210 --> 07:23:59.179
IN THE STREET PROTESTING. WE

07:23:59.245 --> 07:24:00.280
SHOULD HAVE CONTROL OVER YOUR

07:24:00.347 --> 07:24:01.348
PRIVATE PERSONHOOD, AND YOU

07:24:01.414 --> 07:24:03.283
SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO WEAR A

07:24:03.350 --> 07:24:04.884
MASK. BUT FOR OUR PUBLIC

07:24:04.951 --> 07:24:06.219
EMPLOYEES, OUR PUBLIC OFFICIALS

07:24:06.286 --> 07:24:08.588
WHO WE TASKED TO KEEP US SAFE,

07:24:08.655 --> 07:24:11.091
YES, WE WILL DEFEND THAT MASK.

07:24:11.157 --> 07:24:14.361
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS.

07:24:14.427 --> 07:24:16.496
HERE IN CALIFORNIA, IF YOU ARE

07:24:16.563 --> 07:24:17.297
STOPPED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT,

07:24:17.364 --> 07:24:20.734
THEY HAVE TO TELL YOU WHY THEY

07:24:20.800 --> 07:24:22.635
STOPPED YOU BEFORE THEY CAN ASK

07:24:22.702 --> 07:24:25.605
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. THAT'S THE

07:24:25.672 --> 07:24:26.940
LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND

07:24:27.007 --> 07:24:29.542
TRANSPARENCY WE DEMAND FROM OUR

07:24:29.609 --> 07:24:31.711
PUBLIC SAFETY. NOW IMAGINE IF

07:24:31.778 --> 07:24:32.312
THE PERSON WHO IS APPROACHING

07:24:32.379 --> 07:24:34.280
YOU AND STOPPING YOU NOT ONLY

07:24:34.347 --> 07:24:36.049
IS NOT CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AS A

07:24:36.116 --> 07:24:38.485
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER, BUT

07:24:38.551 --> 07:24:41.621
ALSO WEARING A MASK,

07:24:41.688 --> 07:24:43.223
THREATENING TO TAKE YOU FROM

07:24:43.289 --> 07:24:44.824
WHERE YOU ARE WITHOUT ANY

07:24:44.891 --> 07:24:48.895
QUESTIONS. WE HAVE SEEN ICE

07:24:48.962 --> 07:24:50.630
PERSONNEL IMPERSONATED HERE IN

07:24:50.697 --> 07:24:53.233
CALIFORNIA. COMMUNITIES ARE

07:24:53.299 --> 07:24:56.636
LIVING IN FEAR, RIGHTEOUS,

07:24:56.703 --> 07:25:01.174
ROOTED, WELL FUNDED FEAR. AND I

07:25:01.241 --> 07:25:03.276
UNDERSTAND THAT LOCAL LAW

07:25:03.343 --> 07:25:05.678
ENFORCEMENT FEELS TARGETED BY

07:25:05.745 --> 07:25:07.347
THIS BILL. IMAGINE WHAT IT

07:25:07.414 --> 07:25:10.083
FEELS LIKE TO WORK AT HOME

07:25:10.150 --> 07:25:13.053
DEPOT AT A CAR WASH, IN ANY OF

07:25:13.119 --> 07:25:15.155
THE FARMS ACROSS OUR STATE.

07:25:15.221 --> 07:25:17.657
IMAGINE WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO

07:25:17.724 --> 07:25:20.060
BE A LATINO STUDENT WALKING TO

07:25:20.126 --> 07:25:24.764
SCHOOL. RACIAL PROFILING WAS

07:25:24.831 --> 07:25:26.099
JUST UPHELD BY THE SUPREME

07:25:26.166 --> 07:25:28.201
COURT. THAT MAKES BOTH

07:25:28.268 --> 07:25:30.336
COMMUNITIES LESS SAFE AND ICE

07:25:30.403 --> 07:25:31.571
OFFICIALS LESS SAFE. THERE IS

07:25:31.638 --> 07:25:34.207
NOTHING MORE UNSAFE THAN

07:25:34.274 --> 07:25:36.076
UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRACTICES OR

07:25:36.142 --> 07:25:38.011
CONSTITUTIONALLY QUESTIONABLE

07:25:38.078 --> 07:25:40.313
PRACTICES, BECAUSE WE HAVE A

07:25:40.380 --> 07:25:41.648
BACK AND FORTH GOING ON IN OUR

07:25:41.714 --> 07:25:42.482
JUDICIARY, WHERE THE HIGHEST

07:25:42.549 --> 07:25:44.017
COURTS OF THE LAND HAVE

07:25:44.084 --> 07:25:45.018
FORGOTTEN THAT THE CONSTITUTION

07:25:45.085 --> 07:25:47.654
IS PROTECT THE PEOPLE, NOT THE

07:25:47.720 --> 07:25:50.123
POWER OF THE EXECUTIVE. THAT'S

07:25:50.190 --> 07:25:51.391
WHERE WE HAVE TO STEP IN WITH

07:25:51.458 --> 07:25:53.460
GOOD LAWS, WITH THOUGHTFUL LAWS,

07:25:53.526 --> 07:25:55.395
HEALTHY DEBATE, BUT REMEMBERING

07:25:55.462 --> 07:25:58.498
WE ARE HERE TO SERVE THE PEOPLE

07:25:58.565 --> 07:26:00.533
IN THE SAME WAY OUR LAW

07:26:00.600 --> 07:26:01.167
ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL AND YES,

07:26:01.234 --> 07:26:04.604
EVEN ICE ARE. THIS IS A COMMON

07:26:04.671 --> 07:26:07.006
SENSE, THOUGHTFUL AND MUCH

07:26:07.073 --> 07:26:09.476
NEEDED REFORM. THIS MOMENT

07:26:09.542 --> 07:26:11.010
COULD NOT BE ASKING FOR US TO

07:26:11.077 --> 07:26:13.313
STEP UP IN A STRONGER WAY. IN

07:26:13.379 --> 07:26:15.982
FACT, THIS IS THE MOST BASIC

07:26:16.049 --> 07:26:18.318
WAY WE CAN STEP UP. WE CAN'T

07:26:18.384 --> 07:26:21.354
STOP ICE FROM USING THE 100

07:26:21.421 --> 07:26:22.255
PLUS BILLION DOLLARS THAT

07:26:22.322 --> 07:26:23.990
THEY'VE BEEN GIFTED FROM

07:26:24.057 --> 07:26:26.392
TAXPAYERS TO BUILD PRISONS LIKE

07:26:26.459 --> 07:26:27.894
ALLIGATOR ALCATRAZ. WE CAN'T

07:26:27.961 --> 07:26:29.896
STOP THEM FROM PRODUCING GOOFY

07:26:29.963 --> 07:26:32.165
RECRUITMENT MUSIC VIDEOS, BUT

07:26:32.232 --> 07:26:34.467
WE CAN STOP THEM FROM WEARING

07:26:34.534 --> 07:26:36.269
MASKS AND TERRORIZING OUR

07:26:36.336 --> 07:26:37.737
COMMUNITIES LIKE SOME

07:26:37.804 --> 07:26:39.539
UNACCOUNTABLE SECRET POLICE.

07:26:39.606 --> 07:26:41.975
THAT IS WHAT THIS BILL IS

07:26:42.041 --> 07:26:43.843
ASKING US TO DO. AND I

07:26:43.910 --> 07:26:45.145
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

07:26:45.211 --> 07:26:46.045
THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

07:26:46.112 --> 07:26:48.381
BRIAN, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

07:26:48.448 --> 07:26:50.183
GALLAGHER, YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

07:26:50.250 --> 07:26:52.418
THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. I RISE

07:26:52.485 --> 07:26:55.355
IN OPPOSITION AND NOT BECAUSE I

07:26:55.421 --> 07:26:58.124
DON'T HAVE SYMPATHY FOR CIVIL

07:26:58.191 --> 07:27:00.293
RIGHTS AND ENSURING THAT ALL

07:27:00.360 --> 07:27:02.729
CALIFORNIANS ARE TREATED FAIRLY

07:27:02.795 --> 07:27:05.665
UNDER THE LAW. I'VE GOTTEN UP

07:27:05.732 --> 07:27:06.332
ON THIS FLOOR ACTUALLY MANY

07:27:06.399 --> 07:27:08.067
TIMES AND TALKED ABOUT THAT

07:27:08.134 --> 07:27:11.104
NEED, AND IT'S NOT LOST ON ME

07:27:11.171 --> 07:27:12.972
THAT DURING COVID, WHEN A LOT

07:27:13.039 --> 07:27:14.307
OF CIVIL RIGHTS WERE BEING

07:27:14.374 --> 07:27:16.109
UNDERMINED, YOUR SIDE WAS

07:27:16.176 --> 07:27:19.746
DEAFENINGLY SILENT AND DID VERY

07:27:19.812 --> 07:27:22.415
LITTLE TO PUSH BACK. WELL, YOU

07:27:22.482 --> 07:27:23.216
DID NOTHING TO PUSH BACK

07:27:23.283 --> 07:27:25.318
AGAINST A GOVERNOR WHO TOLD US

07:27:25.385 --> 07:27:27.153
WE COULDN'T EVEN GO TO CHURCH.

07:27:27.220 --> 07:27:30.190
AND BY THE WAY, WHAT WE OPPOSED

07:27:30.256 --> 07:27:34.527
WAS MASK MANDATES REQUIRING TWO

07:27:34.594 --> 07:27:35.428
YEAR OLDS TO WEAR MASKS IN

07:27:35.495 --> 07:27:38.231
SCHOOL. WHEN WE FOUND OUT LATER

07:27:38.298 --> 07:27:40.166
THAT THERE WAS NO SCIENTIFIC

07:27:40.233 --> 07:27:42.135
BASIS FOR DOING SO. BUT YOU

07:27:42.202 --> 07:27:46.005
GUYS SAID NOTHING. SO EXCUSE ME

07:27:46.072 --> 07:27:48.007
IF I JUST DON'T FIND A WHOLE

07:27:48.074 --> 07:27:49.976
LOT OF MORAL CLARITY ON YOUR

07:27:50.043 --> 07:27:51.177
SIDE WHEN IT COMES TO THIS

07:27:51.244 --> 07:27:55.281
ISSUE. BUT HERE'S THE REAL

07:27:55.348 --> 07:27:56.149
CLEAR THING THAT NEEDS TO BE

07:27:56.216 --> 07:27:59.018
MADE THIS BILL. AND IF IT

07:27:59.085 --> 07:28:02.188
BECOMES A LAW, WOULD HAVE NO

07:28:02.255 --> 07:28:03.690
APPLICATION TO FEDERAL LAW

07:28:03.756 --> 07:28:04.290
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. SO ALL

07:28:04.357 --> 07:28:07.126
THE TALK ABOUT FEDERAL LAW

07:28:07.193 --> 07:28:09.295
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS, YOUR BILL

07:28:09.362 --> 07:28:10.430
CAN DO NOTHING ABOUT THEM

07:28:10.496 --> 07:28:12.532
BECAUSE WE ONLY HAVE CONTROL

07:28:12.599 --> 07:28:15.201
OVER STATE JURISDICTION. AND

07:28:15.268 --> 07:28:18.137
YOU KNOW THAT. BUT JUST FOR A

07:28:18.204 --> 07:28:20.840
MOMENT, LET'S TALK ABOUT THOSE

07:28:20.907 --> 07:28:21.341
FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

07:28:21.407 --> 07:28:22.275
OFFICERS WHO THIS BILL DOESN'T

07:28:22.342 --> 07:28:26.713
APPLY TO. THEY'RE DOING THEIR

07:28:26.779 --> 07:28:29.849
JOBS. THEIR JOB IS TO ENFORCE

07:28:29.916 --> 07:28:32.986
FEDERAL LAW. JUST A MOMENT, MR.

07:28:33.052 --> 07:28:34.988
GALLAGHER. STATE YOUR POINT,

07:28:35.054 --> 07:28:36.222
MR. BERMAN. I BELIEVE THE

07:28:36.289 --> 07:28:38.124
MEMBER JUST ADMITTED THAT WHAT

07:28:38.191 --> 07:28:39.425
HE'S TALKING ABOUT HAS NOTHING

07:28:39.492 --> 07:28:41.561
TO DO WITH THE BILL. THAT WAS

07:28:41.628 --> 07:28:43.329
ACTUALLY EXPLICITLY WHAT HE

07:28:43.396 --> 07:28:45.164
SAID. SO I WOULD LIKE HIM TO

07:28:45.231 --> 07:28:47.400
STICK TO THE BILL. THANK YOU,

07:28:47.467 --> 07:28:49.102
MR. BERMAN. MR. GALLAGHER, LÀ

07:28:49.168 --> 07:28:51.004
STATE OF THE MERITS OF THIS

07:28:51.070 --> 07:28:51.938
BILL, PLEASE. THROUGHOUT THIS

07:28:52.005 --> 07:28:53.439
DEBATE, WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

07:28:53.506 --> 07:28:53.973
FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.

07:28:54.040 --> 07:28:55.508
CERTAINLY OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS

07:28:55.575 --> 07:28:57.410
HOUSE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

07:28:57.477 --> 07:28:58.211
FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. SO I'M

07:28:58.278 --> 07:29:00.647
JUST GOING TO SAY THEY'RE DOING

07:29:00.713 --> 07:29:01.547
THEIR JOBS. THEY'RE ENFORCING

07:29:01.614 --> 07:29:04.384
FEDERAL LAW. AND UNDER STATE

07:29:04.450 --> 07:29:07.086
LAW THAT YOU ALL PASSED AND YOU

07:29:07.153 --> 07:29:08.187
ALL SUPPORT BECAUSE YOU KEEP

07:29:08.254 --> 07:29:10.023
TALKING ABOUT HOW THIS BUILDS

07:29:10.089 --> 07:29:11.224
TRUST IN COMMUNITIES UNDER

07:29:11.291 --> 07:29:13.192
SANCTUARY STATE LAW. OUR LOCAL

07:29:13.259 --> 07:29:15.094
LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN'T EVEN

07:29:15.161 --> 07:29:17.196
COOPERATE WITH THEM. SO WHAT

07:29:17.263 --> 07:29:19.365
ARE YOU TO DO WHEN YOUR JOB IS

07:29:19.432 --> 07:29:21.167
TO ENFORCE FEDERAL IMMIGRATION

07:29:21.234 --> 07:29:23.436
LAW, AND YOU CAN GET NO SUPPORT

07:29:23.503 --> 07:29:24.170
FROM LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT?

07:29:24.237 --> 07:29:26.205
WELL, YOU HAVE TO DO SWEEPS.

07:29:26.272 --> 07:29:28.941
YOU HAVE TO DO INFORM SWEEPS.

07:29:29.008 --> 07:29:31.144
AND I GET THAT THERE ARE I GET

07:29:31.210 --> 07:29:34.013
I GET THAT THERE ARE REAL

07:29:34.080 --> 07:29:36.082
PROBLEMS. I HAVEN'T SEEN THE

07:29:36.149 --> 07:29:38.017
SAME KIND OF ISSUES THAT I KNOW

07:29:38.084 --> 07:29:39.085
MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SEEN, AND I

07:29:39.152 --> 07:29:41.821
RESPECT THAT. I LISTEN TO THAT.

07:29:41.888 --> 07:29:44.090
I HEAR THAT, HOWEVER, WHEN THE

07:29:44.157 --> 07:29:45.425
POLICY IS THAT THEY CANNOT

07:29:45.491 --> 07:29:46.893
COOPERATE WITH LOCAL LAW

07:29:46.959 --> 07:29:48.761
ENFORCEMENT, THIS IS WHAT ENDS

07:29:48.828 --> 07:29:50.596
UP HAPPENING. AND I'LL USE JUST

07:29:50.663 --> 07:29:54.233
ONE EXAMPLE. THIS, BY THE WAY,

07:29:54.300 --> 07:29:56.035
THIS IS ALL GONE UP TO THE TO

07:29:56.102 --> 07:29:57.170
THE HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND

07:29:57.236 --> 07:29:59.639
IN THE SUPREME COURT. AND THEY

07:29:59.706 --> 07:30:01.007
HAVE FOUND THAT THESE ACTIONS

07:30:01.074 --> 07:30:02.542
WERE CONSTITUTIONAL. YOU MIGHT

07:30:02.608 --> 07:30:03.776
NOT LIKE THAT DECISION. THAT'S

07:30:03.843 --> 07:30:05.244
FINE. BUT THE HIGHEST COURT IN

07:30:05.311 --> 07:30:07.180
THE LAND FOUND THAT THESE THE

07:30:07.246 --> 07:30:09.115
WAY THEY'RE ENFORCING LAW IS

07:30:09.182 --> 07:30:10.149
CONSTITUTIONAL. AND THE EXAMPLE

07:30:10.216 --> 07:30:12.118
WAS HERE IN SACRAMENTO WHEN

07:30:12.185 --> 07:30:13.353
THERE WAS A RAID AT A HOME

07:30:13.419 --> 07:30:16.089
DEPOT. THAT'S TRUE. BUT WHAT IS

07:30:16.155 --> 07:30:18.257
ALSO TRUE IS THEY ALSO HAD

07:30:18.324 --> 07:30:20.026
WARRANTS, AND THEY ALSO HAD

07:30:20.093 --> 07:30:22.328
DONE BACKGROUND CHECKS TO SEE

07:30:22.395 --> 07:30:24.163
THAT MANY OF THESE PEOPLE WERE

07:30:24.230 --> 07:30:26.299
CRIMINALS, WERE, IN FACT,

07:30:26.366 --> 07:30:26.933
CRIMINALS HAD CRIMINAL RECORDS,

07:30:26.999 --> 07:30:28.167
AND THAT'S WHO THEY PICKED UP.

07:30:28.234 --> 07:30:30.303
BUT WHAT DID THE NEWS SAY? THE

07:30:30.370 --> 07:30:32.305
NEXT DAY, A U.S. CITIZEN WAS

07:30:32.372 --> 07:30:34.140
PICKED UP. ACTUALLY, A US

07:30:34.207 --> 07:30:35.241
CITIZEN WAS PICKED UP. THAT'S

07:30:35.308 --> 07:30:37.143
TRUE. BUT THAT US CITIZEN WAS

07:30:37.210 --> 07:30:38.578
TRYING TO IMPEDE LAW

07:30:38.644 --> 07:30:39.379
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND

07:30:39.445 --> 07:30:42.081
SLASHED ICE CAR TIRES AS THEY

07:30:42.148 --> 07:30:44.550
WERE JUST DOING THEIR JOBS.

07:30:44.617 --> 07:30:46.386
THAT IS HAPPENING TO HERE'S

07:30:46.452 --> 07:30:48.454
WHAT ALSO IS HAPPENING. FEDERAL

07:30:48.521 --> 07:30:50.223
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS

07:30:50.289 --> 07:30:53.126
GETTING DOXED AND HAVING REAL

07:30:53.192 --> 07:30:54.994
VIOLENT THREATS AGAINST THEM.

07:30:55.061 --> 07:30:57.096
BRUTALITY AGAINST ICE AGENTS IS

07:30:57.163 --> 07:31:01.100
UP EXPONENTIALLY 1,000%. AND SO

07:31:01.167 --> 07:31:03.136
YEAH, THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE TO

07:31:03.202 --> 07:31:06.406
WEAR MASKS, BECAUSE THAT IS A

07:31:06.472 --> 07:31:07.607
VERY REAL THREAT TO OUR LAW

07:31:07.673 --> 07:31:09.175
ENFORCEMENT. BUT IT DOESN'T

07:31:09.242 --> 07:31:11.177
EVEN APPLY TO THEM. AND YOU

07:31:11.244 --> 07:31:13.346
KNOW THAT. AND YOU EXEMPTED YOU

07:31:13.413 --> 07:31:15.148
ACTUALLY EXEMPTED STATE LAW

07:31:15.214 --> 07:31:17.016
ENFORCEMENT FROM THE BILL. SO

07:31:17.083 --> 07:31:19.419
IT DOESN'T APPLY TO THEM. SO

07:31:19.485 --> 07:31:21.921
METHINKS IT'S NOT REALLY ABOUT

07:31:21.988 --> 07:31:25.291
THAT, IS IT? 30S MEASURE. BUT

07:31:25.358 --> 07:31:26.559
UNFORTUNATELY IT ONLY APPLIES

07:31:26.626 --> 07:31:29.195
TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE

07:31:29.262 --> 07:31:30.096
PEOPLE WHO ARE STUCK IN THE

07:31:30.163 --> 07:31:32.398
MIDDLE BETWEEN YOUR CRAPPY

07:31:32.465 --> 07:31:34.200
POLICY THAT DOESN'T ALLOW THEM

07:31:34.267 --> 07:31:36.369
TO COOPERATE WITH FEDERAL

07:31:36.436 --> 07:31:38.171
OFFICERS, AND THEY MAY HAVE TO

07:31:38.237 --> 07:31:40.072
BE PART OF SOME KIND OF

07:31:40.139 --> 07:31:42.341
OPERATION, MAYBE, FOR INSTANCE,

07:31:42.408 --> 07:31:44.477
NET FIVE GOING AGAINST DRUG

07:31:44.544 --> 07:31:47.146
CARTELS. MAYBE, FOR INSTANCE,

07:31:47.213 --> 07:31:49.081
GOING AFTER SOME OF THESE

07:31:49.148 --> 07:31:50.283
TERRIBLE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE

07:31:50.349 --> 07:31:51.984
PEDDLING FENTANYL INTO OUR

07:31:52.051 --> 07:31:53.019
COMMUNITIES, THEY THEY MIGHT

07:31:53.085 --> 07:31:55.054
HAVE TO GO DO THIS, AND THEN

07:31:55.121 --> 07:31:56.389
THEY RUN AFOUL OF YOUR LAW THAT

07:31:56.456 --> 07:31:58.090
YOU'RE GOING TO PASS AND YOU'RE

07:31:58.157 --> 07:31:59.325
GOING TO TAKE AWAY QUALIFIED

07:31:59.392 --> 07:32:00.460
IMMUNITY THAT WE'VE GIVEN TO

07:32:00.526 --> 07:32:01.994
EVERY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER

07:32:02.061 --> 07:32:03.129
SO THEY CAN FEEL SAFE DOING

07:32:03.196 --> 07:32:05.198
THEIR JOB. THANK YOU, MR.

07:32:05.264 --> 07:32:06.566
GALLAGHER. IMPEDING THEIR JOB.

07:32:06.632 --> 07:32:09.936
THANK YOU, MR. NÓ. THANK YOU,

07:32:10.002 --> 07:32:11.103
ASSEMBLYMEMBER GALLAGHER,

07:32:11.170 --> 07:32:13.272
ASSEMBLY MEMBER MARK JEFF

07:32:13.339 --> 07:32:17.043
GONZALEZ, YOU'RE RECOGNIZED.

07:32:17.109 --> 07:32:23.182
LONG DAY, MR. SPEAKER. I RISE

07:32:23.249 --> 07:32:25.051
JUST TO CLARIFY A COUPLE PIECES

07:32:25.117 --> 07:32:28.488
THAT I THAT I HEARD HERE TODAY,

07:32:28.554 --> 07:32:31.324
AND I WANT TO USE A DEFINITION.

07:32:31.390 --> 07:32:33.726
SO THAT WAY I CAN FRAME WHAT

07:32:33.793 --> 07:32:35.528
I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT HERE AT

07:32:35.595 --> 07:32:37.263
THE PERMISSION OF THE OF THE

07:32:37.330 --> 07:32:39.665
SPEAKER. WITHOUT OBJECTION,

07:32:39.732 --> 07:32:42.969
TERRORISM BY DEFINITION, IS THE

07:32:43.035 --> 07:32:47.373
USE OR THREAT OF VIOLENCE TO

07:32:47.440 --> 07:32:50.476
INTIMIDATE OR COERCE A CIVILIAN

07:32:50.543 --> 07:32:53.446
POPULATION OR GOVERNMENT WITH

07:32:53.513 --> 07:32:56.315
THE GOAL OF ACHIEVING POLITICAL,

07:32:56.382 --> 07:32:59.452
IDEOLOGICAL, RELIGIOUS OR

07:32:59.519 --> 07:33:01.554
SOCIAL OBJECTIVES. THAT IS THE

07:33:01.621 --> 07:33:04.924
DEFINITION OF TERRORISM. AS I

07:33:04.991 --> 07:33:07.159
HEARD THE DEBATE BACK AND FORTH

07:33:07.226 --> 07:33:10.029
ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON HERE,

07:33:10.096 --> 07:33:14.100
AS A COMBAT VETERAN, I ALWAYS

07:33:14.166 --> 07:33:16.469
WANT TO TAKE CARE OF MY MARINES.

07:33:16.536 --> 07:33:17.403
THAT'S JUST KIND OF THAT'S WHAT

07:33:17.470 --> 07:33:19.138
I DO. THAT'S HOW I WAS TRAINED.

07:33:19.205 --> 07:33:21.674
THAT'S JUST IT'S AN INGRAINED

07:33:21.741 --> 07:33:24.010
INSIDE OF US. BUT THE

07:33:24.076 --> 07:33:25.311
UTILIZATION OF SOME OF THE

07:33:25.378 --> 07:33:28.748
WORDS THAT WE USED HERE TODAY

07:33:28.814 --> 07:33:32.018
RUN AFOUL OF, OF TRYING TO

07:33:32.084 --> 07:33:35.288
COERCE A POPULATION TO THINK

07:33:35.354 --> 07:33:38.124
CERTAIN THINGS. AND LET ME, LET

07:33:38.190 --> 07:33:40.293
ME JUST GO DOWN THESE PIECES,

07:33:40.359 --> 07:33:43.696
BECAUSE WHAT THIS DOES TO OUR

07:33:43.763 --> 07:33:44.564
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND BY

07:33:44.630 --> 07:33:46.098
THE WAY, IN MY DISTRICT, I HAVE

07:33:46.165 --> 07:33:48.234
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT, I HAVE

07:33:48.301 --> 07:33:50.303
STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT, I HAVE

07:33:50.369 --> 07:33:52.204
FOLKS FROM THE CUSTOMS AND

07:33:52.271 --> 07:33:56.075
BORDER PATROL, ICE, FBI, SO ON

07:33:56.142 --> 07:33:57.877
AND SO FORTH. SO THEY THEY'RE

07:33:57.944 --> 07:33:59.145
THROUGHOUT MY ENTIRE DISTRICT

07:33:59.211 --> 07:34:00.146
BECAUSE I HAVE A BORDER

07:34:00.212 --> 07:34:03.649
DISTRICT. WHEN WE USE WORDS

07:34:03.716 --> 07:34:05.151
LIKE SECRET POLICE, WE'RE

07:34:05.217 --> 07:34:07.320
TALKING ABOUT THE PEOPLE IN MY

07:34:07.386 --> 07:34:10.122
DISTRICT. WHEN WE USE WORDS

07:34:10.189 --> 07:34:11.691
LIKE MY LAW ENFORCEMENT

07:34:11.757 --> 07:34:13.492
OFFICERS ARE MASKED VIGILANTES,

07:34:13.559 --> 07:34:15.895
THEY'RE KIDNAPERS, EXTREME

07:34:15.962 --> 07:34:18.631
MASKING, RACIAL PROFILING,

07:34:18.698 --> 07:34:21.067
HUNTING IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD,

07:34:21.133 --> 07:34:24.604
REIGN OF TERROR, MASKED AGENTS,

07:34:24.670 --> 07:34:27.473
RENDITION BY MASKED THUGS,

07:34:27.540 --> 07:34:29.875
MILITARIZED MILITARIZATION OF

07:34:29.942 --> 07:34:32.144
LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND A CAMPAIGN

07:34:32.211 --> 07:34:34.380
OF FEAR ON IMMIGRANTS. I GO

07:34:34.447 --> 07:34:36.082
BACK TO ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES

07:34:36.148 --> 07:34:38.217
WHO VERY POIGNANTLY SAID, WE

07:34:38.284 --> 07:34:41.120
HAVE TO BE SENSITIVE AND

07:34:41.187 --> 07:34:43.289
WELL-INTENTIONED, AND I THINK

07:34:43.356 --> 07:34:45.257
WE WE'VE LOST THAT PIECE IN

07:34:45.324 --> 07:34:47.326
THIS DEBATE, THAT WE ARE NOT

07:34:47.393 --> 07:34:50.096
SENSITIVE TO ALL SIDES OF THIS,

07:34:50.162 --> 07:34:52.231
THIS PUZZLE, BECAUSE IN MY

07:34:52.298 --> 07:34:55.234
DISTRICT, MY HARD WORKING MEN

07:34:55.301 --> 07:34:57.036
AND WOMEN THAT PROTECT OUR NOT

07:34:57.103 --> 07:34:59.538
ONLY OUR CITIES, OUR STATE AND

07:34:59.605 --> 07:35:01.374
OUR NATION ARE NOT SECRET

07:35:01.440 --> 07:35:03.609
POLICE. SO WHEN WE CALL THEM

07:35:03.676 --> 07:35:05.878
THAT, WE ARE OFFENDING THEM.

07:35:05.945 --> 07:35:08.047
WHEN WE SAY THAT THEY ARE

07:35:08.114 --> 07:35:09.982
MASKED VIGILANTES, WE ARE

07:35:10.049 --> 07:35:13.419
OFFENDING THEM. THIS BILL, I

07:35:13.486 --> 07:35:14.787
UNDERSTAND THE THE CONTEXT OF

07:35:14.854 --> 07:35:16.555
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, BUT WHEN

07:35:16.622 --> 07:35:18.424
WE COMMUNICATE THESE THINGS, WE

07:35:18.491 --> 07:35:21.093
ARE ACTIVELY OFFENDING A

07:35:21.160 --> 07:35:23.229
POPULATION OF PEOPLE THAT DON'T

07:35:23.295 --> 07:35:24.163
HAVE SOMEONE UP HERE TO SPEAK

07:35:24.230 --> 07:35:26.632
ON THEIR BEHALF. AND I SPEAK ON

07:35:26.699 --> 07:35:28.601
THEIR BEHALF AS SOMEONE WHO

07:35:28.668 --> 07:35:30.136
HELD THE LINE, AS SOMEONE WHO

07:35:30.202 --> 07:35:33.105
HAD TO GO FIGHT FOR OUR NATION

07:35:33.172 --> 07:35:34.940
AGAINST ALL ENEMIES, FOREIGN

07:35:35.007 --> 07:35:37.276
AND DOMESTIC. SO LET'S BE CLEAR

07:35:37.343 --> 07:35:39.378
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OUR BILLS

07:35:39.445 --> 07:35:41.180
AND ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER, WHEN

07:35:41.247 --> 07:35:43.382
YOU ARE SAYING THAT THE FOLKS

07:35:43.449 --> 07:35:46.218
IN MY DISTRICT ARE MASKED THUGS,

07:35:46.285 --> 07:35:49.055
YOU ARE OFFENDING THEM. WE

07:35:49.121 --> 07:35:51.724
CANNOT DO THAT. WE HAVE, YES,

07:35:51.791 --> 07:35:53.759
WE HAVE TO SHOW DECORUM AND YES,

07:35:53.826 --> 07:35:55.194
WE HAVE TO SHOW LEADERSHIP. AND

07:35:55.261 --> 07:35:56.062
THAT IS NOT A FORM OF

07:35:56.128 --> 07:35:59.465
LEADERSHIP. WHEN YOU OFFEND A

07:35:59.532 --> 07:36:00.766
POPULATION THAT SACRIFICES

07:36:00.833 --> 07:36:04.136
EVERY SINGLE DAY. SO WITH THAT,

07:36:04.203 --> 07:36:08.107
I OPPOSE. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

07:36:08.174 --> 07:36:09.875
MEMBER GONZALEZ. ASSEMBLY

07:36:09.942 --> 07:36:10.376
MEMBER TUNUPA, YOU ARE

07:36:10.443 --> 07:36:13.145
RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MR.

07:36:13.212 --> 07:36:19.919
SPEAKER. JOCELYN. RACHEL MORIN,

07:36:19.985 --> 07:36:22.621
ELIZABETH MEDINA, KAYLA

HAMILTON, KATE STEINLEN, MOLLIE

07:36:26.158 --> 07:36:30.463
TIBBETTS, SARAH ROOT, JAMIEL

07:36:30.529 --> 07:36:33.532
SHAW, DOMINIC. DURDEN, LINCOLN

07:36:33.599 --> 07:36:37.570
RILEY, AND A FRIEND AND A

07:36:37.636 --> 07:36:40.172
BROTHER TO ONE OF MY FRIENDS,

07:36:40.239 --> 07:36:43.743
JODY JONES. ROCKY JONES,

07:36:43.809 --> 07:36:46.345
AMERICAN CITIZENS THAT SHOULD

07:36:46.412 --> 07:36:49.448
BE HERE TODAY THAT WERE ALL

07:36:49.515 --> 07:36:51.984
KILLED BY CRIMINAL ILLEGAL

07:36:52.051 --> 07:36:55.621
IMMIGRANTS THAT WERE LET IN

07:36:55.688 --> 07:36:57.590
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T ENFORCE THE

07:36:57.656 --> 07:37:02.728
LAW. US CODE SECTION 13, 25 AND

07:37:02.795 --> 07:37:05.464
26 STATE WHAT IS THE LAW OF THE

07:37:05.531 --> 07:37:09.969
LAND? AND NOW WE ARE USING THIS

07:37:10.035 --> 07:37:12.638
BILL TO DEMONIZE OUR LAW

07:37:12.705 --> 07:37:15.007
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. YOU

07:37:15.074 --> 07:37:18.043
CANNOT SAY THAT YOU SUPPORT LAW

07:37:18.110 --> 07:37:20.579
ENFORCEMENT AND VOTE YES ON

07:37:20.646 --> 07:37:23.015
THIS BILL WHEN THEY ARE ASKING

07:37:23.082 --> 07:37:26.719
YOU NOT TO DO IT. WHEN THIS IS

07:37:26.786 --> 07:37:29.488
BEING USED AS A VEHICLE TO

07:37:29.555 --> 07:37:30.956
DISMANTLE QUALIFIED IMMUNITY,

07:37:31.023 --> 07:37:33.192
YOU CAN GET UP AND SAY, I LOVE

07:37:33.259 --> 07:37:36.662
MY LAW ENFORCEMENT, I LOVE MY

07:37:36.729 --> 07:37:37.229
OFFICERS, I LOVE EVERYTHING

07:37:37.296 --> 07:37:44.970
ELSE. BUT BUT NOTHING. THEY'RE

07:37:45.037 --> 07:37:47.306
LISTED AS THE OPPOSITION

07:37:47.373 --> 07:37:50.709
HIGHWAY PATROL, STATE SHERIFFS,

07:37:50.776 --> 07:37:55.648
OUR DA'S, OUR DSA'S PORAC. HOW

07:37:55.714 --> 07:37:57.983
MANY MORE YOU COULD CHOOSE TO

07:37:58.050 --> 07:38:00.152
LISTEN TO THE ACU? YOU CAN

07:38:00.219 --> 07:38:01.320
CHOOSE TO LISTEN TO OTHER

07:38:01.387 --> 07:38:03.389
ACTIVIST GROUPS THAT HAVE

07:38:03.455 --> 07:38:05.257
SYSTEMATICALLY DISMANTLED AND

07:38:05.324 --> 07:38:07.393
LED TO THIS HUGE CRIME WAVE

07:38:07.459 --> 07:38:09.161
THAT WE HAVE TO THE DEATHS AND

07:38:09.228 --> 07:38:11.297
MURDERS OF AMERICAN CITIZENS. I

07:38:11.363 --> 07:38:14.200
CAN TELL YOU THIS FOR A FACT.

07:38:14.266 --> 07:38:15.835
MY IMMIGRANT FAMILY IS NOT

07:38:15.901 --> 07:38:19.605
AFRAID. MY IMMIGRANT FAMILY IS

07:38:19.672 --> 07:38:20.406
NOT AFRAID BECAUSE WE DID NOT

07:38:20.472 --> 07:38:24.109
BREAK THE LAW. WE FOLLOWED IT.

07:38:24.176 --> 07:38:25.411
AND THIS CONFLATION BETWEEN

07:38:25.477 --> 07:38:27.179
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AND LEGAL

07:38:27.246 --> 07:38:29.982
IMMIGRANTS IS A USE AS A

07:38:30.049 --> 07:38:31.250
VEHICLE TO DISMANTLE THIS

07:38:31.317 --> 07:38:33.452
ENTIRE THING. THIS IS WRONG.

07:38:33.519 --> 07:38:35.988
EXCUSE ME, MR. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

07:38:36.055 --> 07:38:37.990
SCHULTZ, STATE YOUR POINT OF

07:38:38.057 --> 07:38:41.327
ORDER. THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER.

07:38:41.393 --> 07:38:42.127
APPRECIATE HIS COMMENTS. I

07:38:42.194 --> 07:38:44.063
WOULD ASK THAT THE MEMBER

07:38:44.129 --> 07:38:45.130
CONFINE HIS DISCUSSION TO THE

07:38:45.197 --> 07:38:47.166
MERITS OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU,

07:38:47.233 --> 07:38:48.634
ASSEMBLY MEMBER SCHULTZ. YOUR

07:38:48.701 --> 07:38:49.268
POINT IS WELL TAKEN. MR. TONG,

07:38:49.335 --> 07:38:51.437
PLEASE STATE TO THE MERITS OF

07:38:51.503 --> 07:38:53.973
THIS LEGISLATION, IT WAS STATED

07:38:54.039 --> 07:38:56.809
THAT THIS BILL WAS USED TO

07:38:56.876 --> 07:38:58.077
PROTECT IMMIGRANTS, WAS TO MAKE

07:38:58.143 --> 07:39:01.447
SURE THAT RACIAL PROFILING AND

07:39:01.513 --> 07:39:04.116
EVERYTHING ELSE WAS WORKED

07:39:04.183 --> 07:39:05.384
THROUGH. THAT IS WHAT'S BEEN

07:39:05.451 --> 07:39:07.253
STATED HERE. I'M SIMPLY

07:39:07.319 --> 07:39:09.889
RESPONDING TO IT. MR. TONG,

07:39:09.955 --> 07:39:12.925
THAT'S NOT IN THIS LEGISLATION.

07:39:12.992 --> 07:39:14.927
THIS LEGISLATION IS VERY

07:39:14.994 --> 07:39:16.795
SPECIFIC. YOU CAN SPEAK TO THE

07:39:16.862 --> 07:39:18.530
MERITS OF THIS BILL. OUR

07:39:18.597 --> 07:39:22.167
OFFICERS ARE ASKING FOR US TO

07:39:22.234 --> 07:39:25.337
SUPPORT THEM. OUR OFFICERS ARE

07:39:25.404 --> 07:39:28.173
ASKING US TO PROTECT THEM WHILE

07:39:28.240 --> 07:39:30.109
THEY TRY TO ENFORCE THE LAW. IF

07:39:30.175 --> 07:39:32.344
WE WANT TO CHANGE THE LAW WHEN

07:39:32.411 --> 07:39:33.879
IT COMES TO IMMIGRATION POLICY,

07:39:33.946 --> 07:39:36.949
THERE IS A WAY TO DO IT, AND IT

07:39:37.016 --> 07:39:38.017
IS THROUGH CONGRESS. THERE ARE

07:39:38.083 --> 07:39:40.719
POLICIES IN PLACE, BUT WITH

07:39:40.786 --> 07:39:42.388
THIS LAW, IT GOES IN DIRECT

07:39:42.454 --> 07:39:44.123
CONFLICT THAT HAS CREATED THE

07:39:44.189 --> 07:39:46.325
CHAOS THAT WE ARE LIVING IN

07:39:46.392 --> 07:39:48.627
TODAY, AND THEY ARE SIMPLY

07:39:48.694 --> 07:39:50.529
ASKING FOR COORDINATION.

07:39:50.596 --> 07:39:52.131
WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO FIGURE

07:39:52.197 --> 07:39:54.066
THIS THING OUT, THEY DESERVE

07:39:54.133 --> 07:39:57.136
THESE PROTECTIONS UNTIL WE CAN

07:39:57.202 --> 07:40:00.306
FOCUS ON WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE.

07:40:00.372 --> 07:40:03.542
THE PEOPLE HERE ARE ASKING FOR

07:40:03.609 --> 07:40:07.079
US. THIS BILL IS PART OF A

07:40:07.146 --> 07:40:09.148
CRIMINAL FIRST AGENDA, AND WE

07:40:09.214 --> 07:40:11.216
NEED TO PUT CALIFORNIANS FIRST.

07:40:11.283 --> 07:40:13.085
AND WE NEED TO PUT AMERICANS

07:40:13.152 --> 07:40:15.354
FIRST. WE NEED TO ENFORCE THE

07:40:15.421 --> 07:40:17.856
LAWS THAT ARE ON THE BOOK. IT

07:40:17.923 --> 07:40:18.991
IS NOT SUBJECTIVE. LET'S

07:40:19.058 --> 07:40:21.293
PROTECT OUR OFFICERS AND VOTE

07:40:21.360 --> 07:40:24.697
NO ON THIS RIDICULOUS PIECE OF

07:40:24.763 --> 07:40:26.865
LEGISLATION. THANK YOU.

07:40:26.932 --> 07:40:27.933
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. ASSEMBLY

07:40:28.000 --> 07:40:30.369
MEMBER. RODRIGUEZ, YOU ARE

07:40:30.436 --> 07:40:34.273
RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU. I RISE

07:40:34.340 --> 07:40:36.976
IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB 627,

07:40:37.042 --> 07:40:40.112
NOT JUST AS A LEGISLATOR WHO'S

07:40:40.179 --> 07:40:43.282
LATINA AND REPRESENTS A FAMILY

07:40:43.349 --> 07:40:46.318
AND COMMUNITY WITH STRONG

07:40:46.385 --> 07:40:47.686
IMMIGRANT TIES AND UNDERSTANDS

07:40:47.753 --> 07:40:51.056
WHAT IT MEANS TO LIVE IN FEAR,

07:40:51.123 --> 07:40:54.626
EVEN THOSE FOLLOWING THE LAW,

07:40:54.693 --> 07:40:56.028
GOING TO COURT FOR THEIR

07:40:56.095 --> 07:40:58.964
APPOINTMENTS, DOING IT THE

07:40:59.031 --> 07:41:02.534
RIGHT WAY THAT YOU CLAIM ARE

07:41:02.601 --> 07:41:05.404
STILL BEING TAKEN. AMERICANS,

07:41:05.471 --> 07:41:07.439
AS OTHER MEMBERS HAVE POINTED

07:41:07.506 --> 07:41:11.243
OUT, ARE STILL BEING TAKEN. I

07:41:11.310 --> 07:41:13.012
ALSO STAND AS FAMILY OF LAW

07:41:13.078 --> 07:41:15.280
ENFORCEMENT WHO ARE PROUD, NOT

07:41:15.347 --> 07:41:17.049
AFRAID TO SHOW THEIR FACE AND

07:41:17.116 --> 07:41:21.253
THEIR BADGE. ACCOUNTABILITY IS

07:41:21.320 --> 07:41:24.223
NOT NEGOTIABLE. PUBLIC

07:41:24.289 --> 07:41:25.724
TRANSPARENCY IS NOT OPTIONAL,

07:41:25.791 --> 07:41:28.227
AND CALIFORNIA DESERVES TO KNOW

07:41:28.293 --> 07:41:31.130
THAT THOSE ENFORCING THE LAW DO

07:41:31.196 --> 07:41:34.967
SO OPENLY AND WITH INTEGRITY. I

07:41:35.034 --> 07:41:37.302
INVITE THE MINORITY LEADER TO

07:41:37.369 --> 07:41:40.205
COME TO LOS ANGELES JUST TODAY,

07:41:40.272 --> 07:41:42.241
WHILE WE HAVE BEEN SITTING IN

07:41:42.307 --> 07:41:44.176
THIS CHAMBER, THERE ARE REPORTS

07:41:44.243 --> 07:41:46.311
OF A RAID IN THE SAN FERNANDO

07:41:46.378 --> 07:41:48.981
VALLEY WHERE I REPRESENT THE

07:41:49.048 --> 07:41:51.483
MEDICAL CLINIC THAT WAS NEARBY

07:41:51.550 --> 07:41:57.990
WENT ON LOCKDOWN. WHAT SIGNAL?

07:41:58.057 --> 07:42:01.260
DOES THIS TELL OUR CHILDREN WHO

07:42:01.326 --> 07:42:03.328
ARE SITTING IN THAT WAITING

07:42:03.395 --> 07:42:06.265
ROOM WAITING FOR THE DOCTOR?

07:42:06.331 --> 07:42:08.267
HOW DO WE LET THEM KNOW WHO'S

07:42:08.333 --> 07:42:10.369
THERE TO PROTECT THEM, AND

07:42:10.436 --> 07:42:12.037
WHO'S GOING TO BE THERE TO HARM

07:42:12.104 --> 07:42:13.305
THEM? BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY

07:42:13.372 --> 07:42:14.940
WHAT'S HAPPENING. WE'RE TALKING

07:42:15.007 --> 07:42:17.443
ABOUT THE PEOPLE HARMING THESE

07:42:17.509 --> 07:42:18.844
KIDS AND THESE FAMILIES AND

07:42:18.911 --> 07:42:19.945
THESE COMMUNITIES, AND THE

07:42:20.012 --> 07:42:22.181
ABILITY TO DIFFERENTIATE THEM

07:42:22.247 --> 07:42:25.517
FROM THE OFFICERS AND THE LAW

07:42:25.584 --> 07:42:27.186
ENFORCEMENT WHO HAVE BUILT

07:42:27.252 --> 07:42:28.987
TRUST WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES.

07:42:29.054 --> 07:42:31.457
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS

07:42:31.523 --> 07:42:35.727
ERODING THAT TRUST. THIS BILL

07:42:35.794 --> 07:42:38.030
IS NOT JUST ABOUT POLICY. IT IS

07:42:38.097 --> 07:42:40.499
ABOUT ASSERTING THAT WE WILL

07:42:40.566 --> 07:42:42.668
NOT TOLERATE SECRET POLICING,

07:42:42.734 --> 07:42:45.471
AND WE SHOULD ALL STAND BY THAT.

07:42:45.537 --> 07:42:48.707
LAW ENFORCEMENT MUST ALWAYS BE

07:42:48.774 --> 07:42:50.809
GUIDED BY TRANSPARENCY, TRUST

07:42:50.876 --> 07:42:52.077
AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE

07:42:52.144 --> 07:42:54.546
SAFETY OF ALL OF US AND

07:42:54.613 --> 07:42:56.014
EVERYONE IN OUR COMMUNITY. WITH

07:42:56.081 --> 07:42:58.317
THAT, I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST

07:42:58.383 --> 07:43:01.420
YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU,

07:43:01.487 --> 07:43:04.223
ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ.

07:43:04.289 --> 07:43:06.792
SEEING AND HEARING NO FURTHER

07:43:06.859 --> 07:43:07.292
DEBATE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

07:43:07.359 --> 07:43:09.795
CARRILLO, DO YOU WISH TO CLOSE?

07:43:09.862 --> 07:43:11.697
THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. FIRST,

07:43:11.763 --> 07:43:13.465
I WANT TO THANK ALL THE MEMBERS

07:43:13.532 --> 07:43:16.135
FOR THE DEBATE, REGARDLESS OF

07:43:16.201 --> 07:43:18.871
WHERE THEY STAND. SOMETHING

07:43:18.937 --> 07:43:21.173
THAT RESONATED WITH ME, REALLY,

07:43:21.240 --> 07:43:23.175
OF ALL THE DEBATE, IS WHAT THE

07:43:23.242 --> 07:43:27.279
MEMBER FROM VENTURA SAID TODAY.

07:43:27.346 --> 07:43:28.213

07:46:42.074 --> 07:46:46.144
THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. I RISE

TO PRESENT AB 1312 BACK ON

07:46:51.416 --> 07:46:52.517
CONCURRENCE. AMENDMENTS IN THE

07:46:52.584 --> 07:46:54.386

07:46:54.453 --> 07:46:56.755
AND REMOVED OPPOSITION TO THE

07:46:56.822 --> 07:46:58.990
BILL. YOU KNOW, THIS IS AN

07:46:59.057 --> 07:47:01.193
IMPORTANT BILL TO ME BECAUSE AS

07:47:01.259 --> 07:47:02.494
SOMEONE WHO SITS ON THE HEALTH

07:47:02.561 --> 07:47:04.329
COMMITTEE, THE HEALTH BUDGET

07:47:04.396 --> 07:47:06.531
SUBCOMMITTEE, WE'VE SEEN HOW

07:47:06.598 --> 07:47:09.368
THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION IS

07:47:09.434 --> 07:47:10.769
REALLY GOING AFTER HEALTH CARE

07:47:10.836 --> 07:47:14.039
FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED IT THE MOST.

07:47:14.106 --> 07:47:15.807
AND THIS IS A MOMENT IN WHEN

07:47:15.874 --> 07:47:17.109
IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE ENSURE

07:47:17.175 --> 07:47:19.978

07:47:20.045 --> 07:47:21.279
INFORMING PATIENTS WHEN THEY

07:47:21.346 --> 07:47:23.048
NEED FINANCIAL SUPPORT, IT CAN

07:47:23.115 --> 07:47:25.751
BE THERE FOR THEM. MEDICAL DEBT

07:47:25.817 --> 07:47:28.120
IS THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF

07:47:28.186 --> 07:47:29.988
BANKRUPTCY, AND IT CONTINUES.

07:47:30.055 --> 07:47:32.157
THE THE COST OF HEALTH CARE IS

07:47:32.224 --> 07:47:34.326
THE NUMBER ONE REASON THAT

07:47:34.393 --> 07:47:36.128
PATIENTS SKIP OR DELAY GETTING

07:47:36.194 --> 07:47:38.296
THE CARE THAT THEY NEED. AND SO

07:47:38.363 --> 07:47:40.365
THIS IS REALLY AN OPPORTUNITY

07:47:40.432 --> 07:47:42.667
FOR US TO PROVIDE PEACE OF MIND

07:47:42.734 --> 07:47:44.136
TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE WHO NEED

07:47:44.202 --> 07:47:46.338
HEALTH CARE ARE NOT WORRYING

07:47:46.405 --> 07:47:48.340
ABOUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO PAY

07:47:48.407 --> 07:47:49.641

THEMSELVES AND GETTING HOME TO

07:47:52.544 --> 07:47:54.146

07:55:05.310 --> 07:55:08.379
SAFE. THE ONLY REASON TO THROW

07:55:08.446 --> 07:55:12.183
A US SENATOR TO THE GROUND FOR

07:55:12.250 --> 07:55:15.153
TRYING TO ASK A QUESTION IS TO

07:55:15.220 --> 07:55:19.490
SEND A MESSAGE THAT NO ONE IS

07:55:19.557 --> 07:55:24.028
SAFE, AND THE ONLY REASON TO

07:55:24.095 --> 07:55:26.364
ARREST AND PROSECUTE A LABOR

07:55:26.431 --> 07:55:29.500
LEADER SPEAKING OUT FOR ALL OF

07:55:29.567 --> 07:55:33.004
US IS TO SEND A MESSAGE THAT

07:55:33.071 --> 07:55:36.774
DISSENT WILL NOT BE TOLERATED.

07:55:36.841 --> 07:55:38.910
THE SAD TRUTH IS, THE

07:55:38.977 --> 07:55:43.615
PRESIDENT'S TACTICS DO SEEM TO

07:55:43.681 --> 07:55:45.984
BE WORKING. SCHOOLS IN THE

07:55:46.050 --> 07:55:47.652
CENTRAL VALLEY HAVE REPORTED

07:55:47.719 --> 07:55:52.523
ABSENCE RATES 20% ABOVE NORMAL.

07:55:52.590 --> 07:55:54.959
SOME SCHOOLS IN LA ARE SEEING

07:55:55.026 --> 07:56:00.465
ABSENCES, ECLIPSING 30%. WHEN

07:56:00.531 --> 07:56:01.900
PARENTS WORRY THAT DROPPING

07:56:01.966 --> 07:56:05.703
THEIR KIDS OFF AT SCHOOL MIGHT

07:56:05.770 --> 07:56:07.405
RESULT IN DEPORTATION, THEY

07:56:07.472 --> 07:56:11.709
DON'T GO WHEN ATTENDANCE DROPS,

07:56:11.776 --> 07:56:14.712
FUNDING DISAPPEARS, AND WHEN

07:56:14.779 --> 07:56:17.282
FUNDING DISAPPEARS, ALL

07:56:17.348 --> 07:56:19.083
STUDENTS SUFFER, REGARDLESS OF

07:56:19.150 --> 07:56:22.053
THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS.

07:56:22.120 --> 07:56:26.391
PASSING AB 1348 MEANS THAT

07:56:26.457 --> 07:56:28.459
REGARDLESS OF YOUR STANCE ON

07:56:28.526 --> 07:56:32.163
IMMIGRATION, YOU DO NOT BELIEVE

07:56:32.230 --> 07:56:34.499
SCHOOL FUNDING SHOULD BE CAUGHT

07:56:34.565 --> 07:56:37.335
IN WASHINGTON'S POLITICAL

07:56:37.402 --> 07:56:39.337
CROSSFIRE. IN A RESPECTFULLY

07:56:39.404 --> 07:56:43.241
REQUEST AN I VOTE. THANK YOU.

07:56:43.308 --> 07:56:44.976
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. ASSEMBLY

07:56:45.043 --> 07:56:45.576
MEMBER. MAYO, YOU ARE

07:56:45.643 --> 07:56:49.147
RECOGNIZED. LET'S LET'S TALK

07:56:49.213 --> 07:56:53.718
ABOUT ATTENDANCE IN SCHOOL. WE

07:56:53.785 --> 07:56:55.353
HAVE A REDUCTION IN ATTENDANCE

07:56:55.420 --> 07:56:58.056
IN OUR SCHOOLS FOR A VARIETY OF

07:56:58.122 --> 07:56:59.357
REASONS, NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH

07:56:59.424 --> 07:57:01.025
IS PEOPLE ARE FLEEING THE STATE

07:57:01.092 --> 07:57:02.327
OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THEY

07:57:02.393 --> 07:57:03.394
CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE HERE

07:57:03.461 --> 07:57:04.963
ANYMORE. THEY CANNOT STOMACH

07:57:05.029 --> 07:57:05.997
LIVING HERE ANYMORE. THEY

07:57:06.064 --> 07:57:08.366
CANNOT GET A JOB TO WORK HERE

07:57:08.433 --> 07:57:11.035
ANYMORE. THERE ARE ISSUES ABOUT

07:57:11.102 --> 07:57:13.738
ATTENDANCE AND FUNDING STREAMS

07:57:13.805 --> 07:57:16.240
TO OUR SCHOOLS. BUT INSTEAD OF

07:57:16.307 --> 07:57:18.443
TRYING TO BLAME IT ON THIS

07:57:18.509 --> 07:57:20.078
BOOGEYMAN ISSUE, FOCUS ON THE

07:57:20.144 --> 07:57:22.413
POLICIES AT THE ROOT OF THE

07:57:22.480 --> 07:57:26.351
PROBLEM. THIS LEGISLATURE HAS

07:57:26.417 --> 07:57:29.554
SPENT THE ENTIRE YEAR FOCUSING

07:57:29.620 --> 07:57:32.557
ON SIDESHOW BILLS, SHINY OBJECT

07:57:32.623 --> 07:57:33.958
GAME OF POLITICS, DISTRACT

07:57:34.025 --> 07:57:37.762
PEOPLE FROM THE PROBLEMS THAT

07:57:37.829 --> 07:57:39.130
THIS BODY HAS NOT MADE PROGRESS

07:57:39.197 --> 07:57:43.167
ON. YOU KNOW, IT'S ONLY BEEN

07:57:43.234 --> 07:57:46.304
NINE MONTHS SINCE WE WERE SWORN

07:57:46.371 --> 07:57:50.375
IN, BUT I STILL REMEMBER THE

07:57:50.441 --> 07:57:52.243
SPEAKER TALKING ABOUT THE COST

07:57:52.310 --> 07:57:53.511
OF LIVING CRISIS AND HOW MUCH

07:57:53.578 --> 07:57:55.279
PROGRESS WE WERE GOING TO MAKE

07:57:55.346 --> 07:57:57.215
ON REDUCING THE COST OF LIVING.

07:57:57.281 --> 07:57:59.784
BUT THIS BODY ACTUALLY HAS

07:57:59.851 --> 07:58:00.885
INCREASED THE COST OF LIVING.

07:58:00.952 --> 07:58:04.155
THE MOMENT. MR. DEMAIO. MR.

07:58:04.222 --> 07:58:05.056
SCHULTZ, STATE YOUR POINT OF

07:58:05.123 --> 07:58:07.091
ORDER AGAIN. MR. SPEAKER, I

07:58:07.158 --> 07:58:08.359
WOULD ASK THE MEMBER FOR SAN

07:58:08.426 --> 07:58:09.927
DIEGO TO CONFINE HIS COMMENTS

07:58:09.994 --> 07:58:11.195
TO THE MERITS OF THE BILL IN

07:58:11.262 --> 07:58:13.398
FRONT OF US AND NOT OTHER

07:58:13.464 --> 07:58:15.967
EXTEMPORANEOUS ITEMS. MR.

07:58:16.034 --> 07:58:17.201
SCHULTZ, YOUR POINT IS WELL

07:58:17.268 --> 07:58:18.403
TAKEN. MR. DEMAIO. I KNOW

07:58:18.469 --> 07:58:20.071
YOU'RE GETTING THERE. IF YOU

07:58:20.138 --> 07:58:21.572
COULD GET THERE, THAT'D BE

07:58:21.639 --> 07:58:23.574
GREAT. THANKS. WE COULD GET

07:58:23.641 --> 07:58:24.409
THERE A LOT QUICKER WITHOUT THE

07:58:24.475 --> 07:58:25.109
CONSTANT INTERRUPTIONS. YOU'LL

07:58:25.176 --> 07:58:28.246
NOTICE I DON'T I DON'T LIKE THE

07:58:28.312 --> 07:58:30.715
IDEA OF INTERRUPTING ON BILLS.

07:58:30.782 --> 07:58:34.118
I KNOW, ACTUALLY, THE RECORD

07:58:34.185 --> 07:58:36.387
WILL SHOW. I NEVER MADE A POINT

07:58:36.454 --> 07:58:38.056
OF ORDER TO INTERRUPT A MEMBER

07:58:38.122 --> 07:58:40.058
WHILE THEY'RE GIVING REMARKS.

07:58:40.124 --> 07:58:41.559
AS MUCH AS I MAY NOT APPRECIATE

07:58:41.626 --> 07:58:44.062
WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY OR AGREE

07:58:44.128 --> 07:58:45.663
WITH IT, THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO

07:58:45.730 --> 07:58:49.167
SAY IT. AND SO AS I WAS, I WAS

07:58:49.233 --> 07:58:50.902
SAYING, YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT

07:58:50.968 --> 07:58:52.570
DAILY ATTENDANCE. WE DO HAVE A

07:58:52.637 --> 07:58:53.471
PROBLEM IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

07:58:53.538 --> 07:58:54.906
LA UNIFIED, FOR EXAMPLE.

07:58:54.972 --> 07:58:57.775
ATTENDANCE IS HAS PLUMMETED.

07:58:57.842 --> 07:58:59.343
IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I

07:58:59.410 --> 07:59:00.912
THINK SOME OF YOU ARE PUSHING

07:59:00.978 --> 07:59:02.146
THIS CHARTER SCHOOL BILL TO

07:59:02.213 --> 07:59:04.115
SHUT DOWN THE CHARTER SCHOOLS.

07:59:04.182 --> 07:59:04.949
YOU DON'T LIKE THE COMPETITION.

07:59:05.016 --> 07:59:08.152
THIS BILL HERE DOES NOTHING BUT

07:59:08.219 --> 07:59:11.089
TRY TO CREATE A A FALSE REASON

07:59:11.155 --> 07:59:13.524
WHY WE'RE HAVING ISSUES WITH

07:59:13.591 --> 07:59:15.059
DAILY ATTENDANCE, DROPPING THE

07:59:15.126 --> 07:59:17.595
AUTHOR OR THE SUPPORTER OF THE

07:59:17.662 --> 07:59:18.329
BILL CITES REDUCTION IN

07:59:18.396 --> 07:59:20.098
ATTENDANCE, AND YOU LAID AT THE

07:59:20.164 --> 07:59:21.899
FEET OF IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT.

07:59:21.966 --> 07:59:24.102
I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S THE

07:59:24.168 --> 07:59:25.403
MAIN DRIVER HERE. I THINK THAT

07:59:25.470 --> 07:59:27.472
THIS IS A BILL IN SEARCH OF A

07:59:27.538 --> 07:59:30.575
PROBLEM. LET'S FOCUS ON WHY OUR

07:59:30.641 --> 07:59:32.443
STUDENTS ARE NOT ATTENDING

07:59:32.510 --> 07:59:34.145
THESE SCHOOLS AND PERHAPS GET

07:59:34.212 --> 07:59:36.948
TO THE THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM

07:59:37.014 --> 07:59:38.249
RATHER THAN DOING A SIDESHOW

07:59:38.316 --> 07:59:39.951
BILL. I OPPOSE THE BILL FOR

07:59:40.017 --> 07:59:42.086
THOSE REASONS. THANK YOU. MR.

07:59:42.153 --> 07:59:44.188
DEMAIO. I SHOULD POINT OUT YOU

07:59:44.255 --> 07:59:45.389
DID A POINT OF ORDER,

07:59:45.456 --> 07:59:46.124
INTERRUPTING MISS RODRIGUEZ

07:59:46.190 --> 07:59:48.326
JUST A FEW SESSIONS AGO, IN THE

07:59:48.392 --> 07:59:50.495
MIDDLE OF HER SPEECH. SOMEBODY

07:59:50.561 --> 07:59:53.197
MEMBER QUIRK-SILVA, YOU ARE

07:59:53.264 --> 07:59:58.369
RECOGNIZED. I STAND IN SUPPORT

07:59:58.436 --> 08:00:02.273
OF AB 1348. CALIFORNIA HAS SOME

08:00:02.340 --> 08:00:04.142
OF THE BEST PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN

08:00:04.208 --> 08:00:08.045
THE COUNTRY. AND YES, SOME WILL

08:00:08.112 --> 08:00:11.282
ARGUE WITH THAT, AS SOME WILL

08:00:11.349 --> 08:00:13.084
ARGUE THAT PEOPLE ARE LEAVING

08:00:13.151 --> 08:00:15.086
CALIFORNIA. AND THERE'S OTHER

08:00:15.153 --> 08:00:16.988
STATS THAT SAY SOME WHO HAVE

08:00:17.054 --> 08:00:19.524
LEFT ARE TRYING TO COME BACK.

08:00:19.590 --> 08:00:21.959
SO IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE STATS

08:00:22.026 --> 08:00:23.761
THAT YOU LOOK AT. BUT WHEN WE

08:00:23.828 --> 08:00:25.363
TALK ABOUT AFFORDABILITY, LET'S

08:00:25.429 --> 08:00:29.167
TALK ABOUT IT. I UNDERSTOOD

08:00:29.233 --> 08:00:31.369
THAT THE LAST ELECTION WAS

08:00:31.435 --> 08:00:34.238
ABOUT EGGS, THE COST OF EGGS

08:00:34.305 --> 08:00:38.209
BEING TOO HIGH. LET'S TALK

08:00:38.276 --> 08:00:41.445
ABOUT WHAT HAS GONE TOO HIGH

08:00:41.512 --> 08:00:43.948
SINCE WE'VE INSTITUTED TARIFFS.

08:00:44.015 --> 08:00:47.151
BABY PRODUCTS HAVE GONE

08:00:47.218 --> 08:00:48.019
SKYROCKETED. IF WE ARE

08:00:48.085 --> 08:00:50.388
CONCERNED ABOUT CAR SEATS,

08:00:50.454 --> 08:00:54.058
ABOUT CRIBS, ABOUT TEXTBOOKS,

08:00:54.125 --> 08:00:57.094
ABOUT SCHOOL SUPPLIES, ASK

08:00:57.161 --> 08:00:58.663
PARENTS IF WE UNDERSTAND

08:00:58.729 --> 08:01:01.966
PARENTS SO WELL. HOW MUCH WERE

08:01:02.033 --> 08:01:03.734
BACKPACKS THIS YEAR COMPARED TO

08:01:03.801 --> 08:01:08.039
LAST YEAR? HOW MUCH WERE THEY?

08:01:08.105 --> 08:01:10.575
THE POINT IS AFFORDABILITY. AND

08:01:10.641 --> 08:01:14.512
WE TALK ABOUT SCHOOL ATTENDANCE.

08:01:14.579 --> 08:01:17.048
THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS THAT

08:01:17.114 --> 08:01:18.316
ATTENDANCE COULD BE DOWN. WE

08:01:18.382 --> 08:01:20.084
KNOW BIRTH RATES ARE DOWN. THAT

08:01:20.151 --> 08:01:24.255
COULD BE A REASON. BUT THERE IS

08:01:24.322 --> 08:01:27.091
ONE THING THAT WE KNOW THAT HAS

08:01:27.158 --> 08:01:29.327
HAPPENED IN THIS SCHOOL YEAR

08:01:29.393 --> 08:01:32.163
AND THAT IS IMMIGRATION RAIDS.

08:01:32.230 --> 08:01:35.433
SO WE CAN MAKE CORRELATIONS. WE

08:01:35.499 --> 08:01:36.701
DON'T HAVE ALL THE DATA. WE

08:01:36.767 --> 08:01:38.336
HAVEN'T INTERVIEWED EVERY

08:01:38.402 --> 08:01:40.137
PARENT ACROSS CALIFORNIA TO

08:01:40.204 --> 08:01:41.973
FIND OUT WHERE THEY'VE GONE, TO

08:01:42.039 --> 08:01:44.475
FIND OUT IF THEY'VE LEFT THE

08:01:44.542 --> 08:01:46.577
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO THERE'S

08:01:46.644 --> 08:01:48.012
PROBABLY MANY REASONS WHY

08:01:48.079 --> 08:01:50.181
ATTENDANCE IS DOWN. BUT WHAT WE

08:01:50.248 --> 08:01:51.449
DO KNOW IS THERE HAVE BEEN

08:01:51.515 --> 08:01:54.151
IMMIGRATION RAIDS, AND WE KNOW

08:01:54.218 --> 08:01:55.453
THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE

08:01:55.519 --> 08:01:57.788
AFRAID TO SEND THEIR KIDS TO

08:01:57.855 --> 08:01:59.357
SCHOOL. BOTTOM LINE NOW, WHY

08:01:59.423 --> 08:02:01.092
SHOULD WE ALL CARE ABOUT CARE

08:02:01.158 --> 08:02:04.929
ABOUT THIS? BECAUSE EVERY ONE

08:02:04.996 --> 08:02:07.732
OF YOUR DISTRICTS THAT YOU HAVE

08:02:07.798 --> 08:02:09.100
PUBLIC SCHOOLS IS FUNDED BY

08:02:09.166 --> 08:02:14.272
DAILY ATTENDANCE. WITH ALREADY

08:02:14.338 --> 08:02:17.908
LOW BIRTH RATES. THIS IS GOING

08:02:17.975 --> 08:02:20.244
TO ACTUALLY AFFECT YOUR PUBLIC

08:02:20.311 --> 08:02:22.913
SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND YES, YOU

08:02:22.980 --> 08:02:25.416
HAVE MANY, MANY CONSTITUENTS IN

08:02:25.483 --> 08:02:27.285
YOUR DISTRICT THAT ATTEND

08:02:27.351 --> 08:02:29.053
PUBLIC SCHOOLS. SOME ATTEND

08:02:29.120 --> 08:02:30.721
PRIVATE SCHOOLS, SOME ATTEND

08:02:30.788 --> 08:02:32.523
CHARTER SCHOOLS. THAT'S A

08:02:32.590 --> 08:02:34.592
PARENT'S CHOICE AND I SUPPORT

08:02:34.659 --> 08:02:37.461
THAT. BUT YOU SHOULD ALSO BE

08:02:37.528 --> 08:02:40.498
INVESTED IN HAVING HIGH QUALITY

08:02:40.564 --> 08:02:42.333
PUBLIC SCHOOLS. AND WITH THAT,

08:02:42.400 --> 08:02:46.003
I SUPPORT AB 1348. THANK YOU.

08:02:46.070 --> 08:02:48.139
ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK-SILVA

08:02:48.205 --> 08:02:50.775
SEEING AND HEARING NO FURTHER

08:02:50.841 --> 08:02:51.409
DEBATE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAINES,

08:02:51.475 --> 08:02:53.978
DO YOU WISH TO CLOSE? YES.

08:02:54.045 --> 08:02:57.081
THANK YOU, MEMBERS FOR ALL THE

08:02:57.148 --> 08:02:58.983
COMMENTS. IF WE WANT TO TALK

08:02:59.050 --> 08:03:01.352
ABOUT SIDESHOWS AND HYPOCRISY,

08:03:01.419 --> 08:03:03.387
THERE'S A LOT OF HYPOCRISY THAT

08:03:03.454 --> 08:03:05.856
WE CAN CALL OUT ON THIS FLOOR.

08:03:05.923 --> 08:03:07.224
BUT THE ONE HYPOCRISY THAT I

08:03:07.291 --> 08:03:10.127
REALLY WANT TO CALL OUT IS

08:03:10.194 --> 08:03:12.196
SAYING THAT YOU CARE ABOUT KIDS,

08:03:12.263 --> 08:03:14.131
SCHOOL FUNDING AND VOTING

08:03:14.198 --> 08:03:16.334
AGAINST THIS BILL THAT IS GOING

08:03:16.400 --> 08:03:19.136
TO DEFUND OUR SCHOOLS. IF WE

08:03:19.203 --> 08:03:20.971
DON'T PROTECT FUNDING FOR

08:03:21.038 --> 08:03:23.708
SCHOOLS. THAT IS A HYPOCRISY.

08:03:23.774 --> 08:03:25.476
SO PLEASE, I VOTE VOTE AYE ON

08:03:25.543 --> 08:03:28.312
THIS BILL. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

ROSE IN OPPOSITION TO A

08:41:28.256 --> 08:41:30.092
PREVIOUS BILL BECAUSE IT MAKES

08:41:30.158 --> 08:41:31.159
IT MUCH HARDER FOR LAW

08:41:31.226 --> 08:41:33.295
ENFORCEMENT TO DO THEIR JOB.

08:41:33.362 --> 08:41:35.230
HOWEVER, I WANTED TO TAKE THIS

08:41:35.297 --> 08:41:41.069
MOMENT TO MEMORIALIZE SB 805

08:41:41.136 --> 08:41:43.305

MANDATE TO SEEK PROOF OF PEOPLE

08:41:46.375 --> 08:41:49.111
AND WHO THEY ARE, SO THAT WHEN

08:41:49.177 --> 08:41:52.914
WE BRING UP AB 495 THAT HAVE NO

08:41:52.981 --> 08:41:54.049
SUCH REQUIREMENTS FOR

VERIFICATION OF IDENTITY OF

SAN DIEGO IS NOT STICKING TO

08:42:18.440 --> 08:42:20.609
THE MERITS OF THE BILL THAT

08:42:20.676 --> 08:42:21.176
WE'RE DEBATING, AND IS ALSO

08:42:21.243 --> 08:42:23.578
MISREPRESENTING ANOTHER BILL.

08:42:23.645 --> 08:42:25.347
THANK YOU. YOUR POINT IS WELL

08:42:25.414 --> 08:42:30.719

SENATE BILL 805 BY SENATOR

PEREZ AND JUSTICE SONIA

08:42:44.533 --> 08:42:46.334
SOTOMAYOR TO THE SUPREME

08:42:46.401 --> 08:42:48.704
COURT'S DECISION. SHE

08:42:48.770 --> 08:42:50.572
HIGHLIGHTED AN INJUSTICE THAT

08:42:50.639 --> 08:42:51.506
OCCURRED AT A SMALL BUSINESS IN

08:42:51.573 --> 08:42:54.076
MY DISTRICT. A CAR WASH IN

08:42:54.142 --> 08:42:54.943
WHITTIER WAS REPEATEDLY

08:42:55.010 --> 08:42:57.179
HARASSED BY ICE AGENTS BEFORE

08:42:57.245 --> 08:42:59.581
THE OWNER, A DUAL CITIZEN OF

08:42:59.648 --> 08:43:01.450
THE U.S. AND MEXICO, WAS

08:43:01.516 --> 08:43:03.518
DETAINED AND QUESTIONED.

08:43:03.585 --> 08:43:05.287
SITUATIONS LIKE THIS ARE

08:43:05.353 --> 08:43:07.556
HAPPENING, HAPPENING ALL

08:43:07.622 --> 08:43:08.356
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND THE

08:43:08.423 --> 08:43:11.059
COUNTRY, AND OUR CONSTITUENTS

08:43:11.126 --> 08:43:13.161
ARE IN FEAR. THEY FEAR GOING TO

08:43:13.228 --> 08:43:15.330
WORK, GOING TO SCHOOL AND

08:43:15.397 --> 08:43:17.232
LIVING THEIR DAILY LIVES. THEY

08:43:17.299 --> 08:43:19.668
ARE ALSO IN FEAR OF LAW

08:43:19.735 --> 08:43:21.136
ENFORCEMENT IMPERSONATORS. AS

08:43:21.203 --> 08:43:22.938
THESE RAIDS CONTINUE, OUR

08:43:23.004 --> 08:43:25.273
CITIZENS HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW

08:43:25.340 --> 08:43:26.908
WHO THEY ARE INTERACTING WITH.

08:43:26.975 --> 08:43:28.577
THIS BILL STRIKES THE BALANCE

08:43:28.643 --> 08:43:30.245
BY KEEPING BOTH LAW ENFORCEMENT

08:43:30.312 --> 08:43:31.947
AND THE PUBLIC SAFE. I

08:43:32.013 --> 08:43:34.116
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

08:43:34.182 --> 08:43:35.984
THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

08:43:36.051 --> 08:43:36.518
CALDERON, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

08:43:36.585 --> 08:43:43.925
EL-HAWARY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

08:43:43.992 --> 08:43:46.194
THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. AND

08:43:46.261 --> 08:43:47.429
MEMBERS, I RISE TODAY IN STRONG

08:43:47.496 --> 08:43:50.165
SUPPORT OF SB 805, A BILL WHICH

08:43:50.232 --> 08:43:52.434
I AM HONORED TO PRINCIPAL

08:43:52.501 --> 08:43:53.902
COAUTHOR THE NØ VIGILANTES ACT.

08:43:53.969 --> 08:43:56.471
THIS BILL IS ABOUT SOMETHING

08:43:56.538 --> 08:43:57.973
VERY SIMPLE THE RIGHT TO KNOW

08:43:58.039 --> 08:44:00.342
WHO IS KNOCKING AT YOUR DOOR,

08:44:00.408 --> 08:44:02.210
STOPPING YOU ON THE STREET, OR

08:44:02.277 --> 08:44:04.012
POINTING A GUN AT YOU.

08:44:04.079 --> 08:44:05.881
ESPECIALLY IF SOMEONE HAS

08:44:05.947 --> 08:44:09.050
SEEMINGLY NO REASON TO STOP YOU

08:44:09.117 --> 08:44:11.553
EXCEPT BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU LOOK

08:44:11.620 --> 08:44:14.055
LIKE. WHAT YOU SOUND LIKE, OR

08:44:14.122 --> 08:44:16.691
EVEN WHAT YOU'RE WEARING. WHO

08:44:16.758 --> 08:44:20.662
ARE THEY REALLY? IN MY DISTRICT,

08:44:20.729 --> 08:44:22.197
WE'VE SEEN MANY PEOPLE STOP BY

08:44:22.264 --> 08:44:24.132
INDIVIDUALS CLAIMING TO BE LAW

08:44:24.199 --> 08:44:25.133
ENFORCEMENT WHO NEVER

08:44:25.200 --> 08:44:26.334
IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES. THEY

08:44:26.401 --> 08:44:28.937
COME IN UNMARKED CARS. NO NAMES,

08:44:29.004 --> 08:44:31.039
NO BADGES, NO UNIFORMS, NOTHING

08:44:31.106 --> 08:44:33.575
TO PROVE WHO THEY ARE.

08:44:33.642 --> 08:44:34.943
OFTENTIMES, WE KNOW THESE ARE

08:44:35.010 --> 08:44:36.645
PEOPLE COMING FROM OTHER STATES

08:44:36.711 --> 08:44:38.180
PRETENDING TO BE LAW

08:44:38.246 --> 08:44:40.482
ENFORCEMENT FOLKS WHO WANT TO

08:44:40.549 --> 08:44:42.417
FEEL POWERFUL AND JUST TRYING

08:44:42.484 --> 08:44:44.386
TO BLEND IN AND DISAPPEAR OUR

08:44:44.452 --> 08:44:47.222
COMMUNITIES. THIS ISN'T SAFETY.

08:44:47.289 --> 08:44:49.191
THIS IS FEAR. THIS IS TERRORISM

08:44:49.257 --> 08:44:51.493
TERRORIZING OUR FAMILIES AND

08:44:51.560 --> 08:44:52.894
ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOODS. AND

08:44:52.961 --> 08:44:54.629
BECAUSE OF RACIAL PROFILING AND

08:44:54.696 --> 08:44:56.131
STEREOTYPING, THEY'RE NOT JUST

08:44:56.198 --> 08:44:57.699
TARGETING IMMIGRANTS. THEY'RE

08:44:57.766 --> 08:44:58.567
TARGETING CITIZENS. CITIZENS

08:44:58.633 --> 08:45:01.970
LIKE MY MOM, A U.S. CITIZEN

08:45:02.037 --> 08:45:03.305
PROUD, WHO CAME HERE FROM

08:45:03.371 --> 08:45:04.406
GUATEMALA, WHO STILL SPEAKS

08:45:04.472 --> 08:45:07.709
WITH AN ACCENT, A THICK ACCENT,

08:45:07.776 --> 08:45:09.477
AND TO SOMEONE WHO IS PROFILING,

08:45:09.544 --> 08:45:10.512
THEY'RE JUST GOING TO SEE HER

08:45:10.579 --> 08:45:13.915
AS ANOTHER LATINA WOMAN. MY

08:45:13.982 --> 08:45:16.117
COMMUNITY HAS LIVED IN FEAR OF

08:45:16.184 --> 08:45:18.153
MASKED AGENTS CARRYING OUT

08:45:18.220 --> 08:45:20.021
IMMIGRATION RAIDS WITHOUT

08:45:20.088 --> 08:45:21.289
IDENTIFICATION. IF SOMETHING

08:45:21.356 --> 08:45:23.892
GOES WRONG DURING AN ICE RAID,

08:45:23.959 --> 08:45:25.160
FAMILIES WOULD HAVE NO ONE TO

08:45:25.227 --> 08:45:27.162
HOLD ACCOUNTABLE, NO ONE TO

08:45:27.229 --> 08:45:29.030
SEEK JUSTICE FROM. SB 805 MAKES

08:45:29.097 --> 08:45:31.533
SURE THAT ANYONE ACTING AS LAW

08:45:31.600 --> 08:45:32.767
ENFORCEMENT, LOCAL, STATE, OR

08:45:32.834 --> 08:45:34.302
FEDERAL HAVE TO SHOW WHO THEY

08:45:34.369 --> 08:45:37.339
ARE. IT GIVES REAL OFFICERS THE

08:45:37.405 --> 08:45:39.040
ABILITY TO HOLD IMPOSTERS

08:45:39.107 --> 08:45:41.176
ACCOUNTABLE. IT PROTECTS

08:45:41.243 --> 08:45:43.278
FAMILIES BY MAKING IT A CRIME

08:45:43.345 --> 08:45:45.413
TO IMPERSONATE LAW ENFORCEMENT.

08:45:45.480 --> 08:45:47.048
IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT NO

08:45:47.115 --> 08:45:50.752
ONE CITIZEN OR IMMIGRANT HAS TO

08:45:50.819 --> 08:45:52.087
GUESS IF THE PERSON IN FRONT OF

08:45:52.153 --> 08:45:54.389
THEM IS THERE TO PROTECT THEM

08:45:54.456 --> 08:45:57.192
OR TO HARM THEM. WHY DO YOU

08:45:57.259 --> 08:46:00.629
NEED TO HIDE YOUR IDENTITY?

08:46:00.695 --> 08:46:02.163
THESE ARE OFFICERS, MANY OF

08:46:02.230 --> 08:46:04.499
THEM LATINOS THEMSELVES, YET

08:46:04.566 --> 08:46:07.535
THEY AVOID ACCOUNTABILITY. DO

08:46:07.602 --> 08:46:09.037
YOU FEEL SHAME FOR THE WORK

08:46:09.104 --> 08:46:12.140
THAT YOU'RE DOING? OUR

08:46:12.207 --> 08:46:13.441
COMMUNITIES DESERVE REAL SAFETY

08:46:13.508 --> 08:46:17.646
AND TRUST, NOT SECRECY. I URGE

08:46:17.712 --> 08:46:21.917
AND I VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

08:46:21.983 --> 08:46:24.552
ASSEMBLY MEMBER LORI, ASSEMBLY

08:46:24.619 --> 08:46:26.221
MEMBER FONG, YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

08:46:26.288 --> 08:46:28.089
THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. AND

08:46:28.156 --> 08:46:29.658
MEMBERS, I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF

08:46:29.724 --> 08:46:31.026
OF THE AAPI LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS

08:46:31.092 --> 08:46:32.994

08:46:33.061 --> 08:46:35.597
SB 805 FOR AAPI COMMUNITIES,

08:46:35.664 --> 08:46:36.197
TRUST IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS

08:46:36.264 --> 08:46:38.199
HAS BEEN ERODED DUE TO PAST

08:46:38.266 --> 08:46:39.100
DISCRIMINATION THAT STRETCHES

08:46:39.167 --> 08:46:40.902
FROM EXCLUSIONARY LAWS TO

08:46:40.969 --> 08:46:42.504
WRONGFUL INCARCERATION. WE MUST

08:46:42.570 --> 08:46:44.572
NOT REPEAT THESE INJUSTICES.

08:46:44.639 --> 08:46:46.041
TODAY, SB 85 PROVIDES ESSENTIAL

08:46:46.107 --> 08:46:47.208
SAFEGUARDS FOR IMMIGRANTS AND

08:46:47.275 --> 08:46:49.277
OTHER MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES,

08:46:49.344 --> 08:46:50.278
MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR

08:46:50.345 --> 08:46:52.514
BAD ACTORS TO EXPLOIT FEAR

08:46:52.580 --> 08:46:53.114
AMONG OUR NEIGHBORS. THIS BILL

08:46:53.181 --> 08:46:55.317
IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS

08:46:55.383 --> 08:46:56.151
BUILDING TRUST IN CALIFORNIA

08:46:56.217 --> 08:46:58.620
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT BY ENSURING

08:46:58.687 --> 08:46:59.254
TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY.

08:46:59.321 --> 08:47:01.556
ON BEHALF OF AAPI LEGISLATIVE

08:47:01.623 --> 08:47:03.258
CAUCUS, I RESPECTFULLY URGE AND

08:47:03.325 --> 08:47:05.293
I VOTE ON SB 805, WHICH STANDS

08:47:05.360 --> 08:47:06.828
FIRMLY AGAINST VIGILANTE

08:47:06.895 --> 08:47:08.296
ACTIONS THAT PUT FAMILIES AT

08:47:08.363 --> 08:47:10.899
RISK. THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

08:47:10.966 --> 08:47:11.533
ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG, ASSEMBLY

YOU KNOW, I WAS READING THE

08:47:18.306 --> 08:47:19.774
LANGUAGE OF THIS BILL, AND

08:47:19.841 --> 08:47:22.110
WE'VE EXEMPTED A LOT OF STATE

08:47:22.177 --> 08:47:24.612
AGENCIES AGAIN, ONCE AGAIN IN

08:47:24.679 --> 08:47:26.314
THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. AND

08:47:26.381 --> 08:47:27.115
WE ALREADY KNOW IT DOESN'T

08:47:27.182 --> 08:47:29.217
APPLY TO FEDERAL LAW

08:47:29.284 --> 08:47:31.119
ENFORCEMENT, DESPITE HIS AS

08:47:34.089 --> 08:47:37.158
THERE ARE SOME STATE EMPLOYEE

08:47:37.225 --> 08:47:38.026
LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT AREN'T

08:47:38.093 --> 08:47:40.028

LEGISLATURE. THEY'RE NOT

08:47:43.565 --> 08:47:45.133
IDENTIFIED HERE. SO MAYBE

08:47:45.200 --> 08:47:46.768
THAT'S A GOOD THING BECAUSE I

08:48:05.320 --> 08:48:06.154
WHO WILL NOT BE EXEMPT FROM

08:48:06.221 --> 08:48:08.223
THIS BILL. IT'S A GOOD THING

08:48:08.289 --> 08:48:09.157
BECAUSE HONESTLY, SOMETIMES I

08:48:09.224 --> 08:48:10.425
FORGET NAMES, AND I'M LOOKING

08:48:10.492 --> 08:48:12.093
FORWARD TO TO WHAT YOUR NAME

08:48:12.160 --> 08:48:14.262
TAGS ARE GOING TO LOOK LIKE.

08:48:14.329 --> 08:48:15.063
AND BUT HOPEFULLY THIS BILL

08:48:15.130 --> 08:48:17.699
FAILS. AND WITH THAT, I

08:48:17.766 --> 08:48:18.433
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE.

08:48:18.500 --> 08:48:19.501
THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

08:48:19.567 --> 08:48:20.268
PATTERSON. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

08:48:20.335 --> 08:48:22.337
BENNETT, YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

08:48:22.404 --> 08:48:23.471
THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. I JUST

08:48:23.538 --> 08:48:25.040
WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THE

08:48:25.106 --> 08:48:27.175
COMMENTS THAT I MADE EARLIER

08:48:27.242 --> 08:48:30.011
ABOUT THE WIENER BILL 697 THAT

08:48:30.078 --> 08:48:33.448
WE HAD. THIS CERTAINLY SUPPORTS

08:48:33.515 --> 08:48:36.184
THE CONCEPT THAT WE WANT TO

08:48:36.251 --> 08:48:38.420
HAVE A PUSHBACK AGAINST

08:48:38.486 --> 08:48:41.156
INAPPROPRIATE MILITARIZATION OF

08:48:41.222 --> 08:48:43.191
CIVILIAN LIFE. AND ONE OF THE

08:48:43.258 --> 08:48:46.294
WAYS TO TO PUSH BACK IS THE

08:48:46.361 --> 08:48:48.029
GOOD BILL THAT THIS AUTHOR HAS

08:48:48.096 --> 08:48:49.597
WORKED REALLY HARD ON. AND I

08:48:49.664 --> 08:48:50.932
APPRECIATE PARTICULARLY THE

08:48:50.999 --> 08:48:53.068
FACT THAT SHE HAS BEEN ABLE TO

08:48:53.134 --> 08:48:54.302
BRING SO MUCH SUPPORT TO THIS

08:48:54.369 --> 08:48:56.071
BILL. SO IN THE INTEREST OF

08:48:56.137 --> 08:48:58.606
TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

08:48:58.673 --> 08:48:59.407
SENDING THE RIGHT MESSAGES AT

08:48:59.474 --> 08:49:00.508
THIS TIPPING POINT TIME IN

08:49:00.575 --> 08:49:03.278
HISTORY, I IMPLORE EVERYBODY ON

08:49:03.344 --> 08:49:05.280
THIS ASSEMBLY FLOOR TO SUPPORT

08:49:05.346 --> 08:49:07.282
A COMMON SENSE BILL LIKE THIS

08:49:07.348 --> 08:49:09.484
THAT SIMPLY SAYS EVERYBODY

08:49:09.551 --> 08:49:11.686
OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY

08:49:11.753 --> 08:49:13.154
WHAT DEPARTMENT THEY'RE WITH

08:49:13.221 --> 08:49:15.256
AND WHO THEY ARE. THANK YOU

08:49:15.323 --> 08:49:17.392
VERY MUCH. I ENCOURAGE AN AYE

08:49:17.459 --> 08:49:18.059
VOTE. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

08:49:18.126 --> 08:49:19.260
MEMBER BENNETT, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

08:49:19.327 --> 08:49:21.596
TUNUPA, YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

08:49:21.663 --> 08:49:22.464
THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. AND

08:49:22.530 --> 08:49:24.199
HERE'S ANOTHER CHANCE. RIGHT

08:49:24.265 --> 08:49:26.901
NOW, LAW ENFORCEMENT IS ASKING

08:49:26.968 --> 08:49:30.638
TO VOTE NO ON THIS, AND IT

08:49:30.705 --> 08:49:31.940
SHOULD SURPRISE EVERYBODY THAT

08:49:32.006 --> 08:49:33.208
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

08:49:33.274 --> 08:49:35.210
ENHANCED PENALTIES AND

08:49:35.276 --> 08:49:36.277
ADDITIONAL PENALTIES FOR

08:49:36.344 --> 08:49:38.213
CRIMINALITY, IT'S EASY TO DO IT

08:49:38.279 --> 08:49:40.048
WHEN IT COMES TO DEMONIZING OUR

08:49:40.115 --> 08:49:42.450
OFFICERS. AND NOT ONLY ARE WE

08:49:42.517 --> 08:49:43.251
DEMONIZING WITH URGENCY, WE'RE

08:49:43.318 --> 08:49:45.353
GOING TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR

08:49:45.420 --> 08:49:47.088
THEM TO DO THEIR JOBS. SO YOU

08:49:47.155 --> 08:49:49.257
CAN SAY YOU SUPPORT LAW

08:49:49.324 --> 08:49:50.825
ENFORCEMENT, OR YOU CAN LISTEN

08:49:50.892 --> 08:49:53.261
TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. ISN'T IT

08:49:53.328 --> 08:49:55.029
CRAZY THAT WHEN JUST TRYING TO

08:49:55.096 --> 08:49:57.899
DO NORMAL THINGS, TRYING TO ADD

08:49:57.966 --> 08:50:00.468
ADDITIONAL PENALTIES FOR CHILD

08:50:00.535 --> 08:50:01.903
SEX TRAFFICKERS IS SUPER HARD

08:50:01.970 --> 08:50:04.005
TO GET THROUGH, BUT PENALTIES

08:50:04.072 --> 08:50:06.508
FOR PEOPLE WHO PROTECT OUR LAW

08:50:06.574 --> 08:50:08.443
ENFORCEMENT AND ENFORCE THE LAW,

08:50:08.510 --> 08:50:10.278
WE CAN'T DO THAT. WE'LL WE'LL

08:50:10.345 --> 08:50:12.080
WORK THAT THROUGH WITH URGENCY.

08:50:12.147 --> 08:50:14.115
LAW ENFORCEMENT IS ASKING YOU

08:50:14.182 --> 08:50:16.317
FOR A NØ YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO

08:50:16.384 --> 08:50:17.318
PROVE THAT YOU ACTUALLY SUPPORT

08:50:17.385 --> 08:50:19.420
LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND I URGE A

08:50:19.487 --> 08:50:20.488
NO TO THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

08:50:20.555 --> 08:50:22.123
MEMBER. ASSEMBLY MEMBER SCHULTZ,

08:50:22.190 --> 08:50:24.492
YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. WELL. THANK

08:50:24.559 --> 08:50:26.327
YOU, MR. SPEAKER. AND MEMBERS,

08:50:26.394 --> 08:50:27.395
I REALLY WASN'T PLANNING TO

08:50:27.462 --> 08:50:28.997
SPEAK. AND THEN I HEARD THE

08:50:29.063 --> 08:50:30.165
MEMBER FROM CLOVIS SPEAK, AND I

08:50:30.231 --> 08:50:32.167
FELT THE NEED TO CORRECT THE

08:50:32.233 --> 08:50:33.368
RECORD. AS CHAIR OF THE

08:50:33.434 --> 08:50:34.569
ASSEMBLY STANDING COMMITTEE ON

08:50:34.636 --> 08:50:36.070
PUBLIC SAFETY, I ACTUALLY HAD A

08:50:36.137 --> 08:50:37.405
CHANCE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE

08:50:37.472 --> 08:50:38.940
AUTHOR WHO CRAFTED THIS BILL

08:50:39.007 --> 08:50:41.042
WITH INPUT FROM THE CALIFORNIA

08:50:41.109 --> 08:50:42.243
POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION.

08:50:42.310 --> 08:50:43.311
THEY'RE IN FACT NEUTRAL. SO I

08:50:43.378 --> 08:50:45.046
WOULD RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE

08:50:45.113 --> 08:50:46.447
WITH THE MEMBER FROM CLOVIS. I

08:50:46.514 --> 08:50:47.949
THINK HE IS INACCURATELY

08:50:48.016 --> 08:50:49.150
PORTRAYED THE STANCE OF ALL OF

08:50:49.217 --> 08:50:51.219
LAW ENFORCEMENT ON THE BILL AS

08:50:51.286 --> 08:50:52.153
BEING OPPOSED. THE OTHER THING

08:50:52.220 --> 08:50:54.222
I WOULD JUST ADD IS TO THE MANY

08:50:54.289 --> 08:50:56.224
MEMBERS WHO HAVE SPOKEN SO FAR

08:50:56.291 --> 08:50:58.026
IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL, I THINK

08:50:58.092 --> 08:50:59.227
IT'S QUITE SIMPLE IN THE UNITED

08:50:59.294 --> 08:51:00.862
STATES OF AMERICA AND CERTAINLY

08:51:00.929 --> 08:51:02.030
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA,

08:51:02.096 --> 08:51:03.231
WHEN SOMEBODY COMES TO ARREST

08:51:03.298 --> 08:51:04.899
YOU, DETAIN YOU, MAKE CONTACT

08:51:04.966 --> 08:51:06.601
WITH YOU, YOU ARE ENTITLED TO

08:51:06.668 --> 08:51:08.536
KNOW THAT THEY ARE, IN FACT,

08:51:08.603 --> 08:51:09.404
LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND THIS IS AN

08:51:09.470 --> 08:51:11.339
ESSENTIAL BILL THAT MAKES SURE

08:51:11.406 --> 08:51:12.240
THAT WE DON'T HAVE VIGILANTISM

08:51:12.307 --> 08:51:13.408
RUNNING RAMPANT IN OUR STREETS.

08:51:13.474 --> 08:51:15.210
IT IS COMMON SENSE. IT REALLY

08:51:15.276 --> 08:51:17.178
SHOULD BE BIPARTISAN AND I HOPE

08:51:17.245 --> 08:51:19.514
TO SEE EVERYONE VOTING. AYE, I

08:51:19.581 --> 08:51:21.049
SURE WILL BE MYSELF. THANK YOU.

08:51:21.115 --> 08:51:23.017
SO, MEMBER SCHULTZ.

08:51:23.084 --> 08:51:23.885
ASSEMBLYMEMBER GALLAGHER,

08:51:23.952 --> 08:51:31.125
YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. SPEAKER.

08:51:31.192 --> 08:51:33.361
THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. I AM

08:51:33.428 --> 08:51:33.962
ACTUALLY REALLY THINKING ABOUT

08:51:34.028 --> 08:51:38.266
THIS ONE. I, I BELIEVE THAT

08:51:38.333 --> 08:51:40.902
WHEN YOU'RE GIVEN THE KIND OF

08:51:40.969 --> 08:51:42.136
POWER THAT WE GIVE OUR POLICE

08:51:42.203 --> 08:51:46.307
OFFICERS AND NECESSARILY SO TO

08:51:46.374 --> 08:51:49.744
KEEP THE PEACE THAT YOU SHOULD

08:51:49.811 --> 08:51:52.013
IDENTIFY YOURSELF. AND

08:51:52.080 --> 08:51:53.114
OBVIOUSLY, OVERWHELMINGLY, WE

08:51:53.181 --> 08:51:54.148
SEE THAT ON THE STREETS,

08:51:54.215 --> 08:51:56.351
OFFICERS THAT HAVE BADGES, THEY

08:51:56.417 --> 08:51:57.118
HAVE BADGE NUMBERS. THAT

08:51:57.185 --> 08:52:00.188
HAPPENS EVERY DAY IN CALIFORNIA.

08:52:00.255 --> 08:52:03.258
AND SO I, YOU KNOW, I DON'T

08:52:03.324 --> 08:52:04.993
KNOW THAT THAT'S HAPPENING A

08:52:05.059 --> 08:52:06.928
WHOLE LOT WHEN IT COMES TO OUR

08:52:06.995 --> 08:52:08.196
CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT. YOU

08:52:08.263 --> 08:52:09.897
KNOW, ANY ANYONE WHO CAN GO OUT

08:52:09.964 --> 08:52:12.166
ON THE STREET AND YOU SEE A LAW

08:52:12.233 --> 08:52:12.934
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER, EVEN THOSE

08:52:13.001 --> 08:52:14.035
OUTSIDE OF OUR CAPITOL,

08:52:14.102 --> 08:52:16.104
SOMETIMES ARE WEARING BADGE AND

08:52:16.170 --> 08:52:17.338
AND IDENTIFYING. AND I THINK

08:52:17.405 --> 08:52:19.073
THAT SHOULD BE THE CASE. AND SO

08:52:19.140 --> 08:52:22.977
THIS THIS BILL SEEMS MUCH MORE

08:52:23.044 --> 08:52:24.212
REASONABLE IN DEALING WITH THAT

08:52:24.279 --> 08:52:26.381
ISSUE. I ALSO I AM CONCERNED

08:52:26.447 --> 08:52:28.249
ABOUT VIGILANTISM, AND THAT IS

08:52:28.316 --> 08:52:30.585
AN ISSUE. AND WE DON'T WANT TO

08:52:30.652 --> 08:52:31.586
HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE

08:52:31.653 --> 08:52:32.453
IMPERSONATING LAW ENFORCEMENT

08:52:32.520 --> 08:52:33.087
PRETENDING TO BE A LAW

08:52:33.154 --> 08:52:35.556
ENFORCEMENT AND USING THAT TO

08:52:35.623 --> 08:52:36.991
INTIMIDATE AND TERRORIZE PEOPLE.

08:52:37.058 --> 08:52:40.762
I SEE THAT ISSUE. MY CONCERN

08:52:40.828 --> 08:52:43.231
WOULD BE ON THE SIDE OF, AGAIN,

08:52:43.298 --> 08:52:46.634
WE'RE WE'RE EXEMPTING STATE LAW

08:52:46.701 --> 08:52:49.270
ENFORCEMENT, AND THIS IS REALLY

08:52:49.337 --> 08:52:50.038
ONLY APPLYING TO LOCAL LAW

08:52:50.104 --> 08:52:52.073
ENFORCEMENT. AND SO I WORRY

08:52:52.140 --> 08:52:54.008
ABOUT THAT, THAT WHY DO WE HAVE

08:52:54.075 --> 08:52:55.243
THAT KIND OF DOUBLE STANDARD.

08:52:55.310 --> 08:52:57.779
AND MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

08:52:57.845 --> 08:52:59.981
COULD BE EXPLAINED IN THE CLOSE

08:53:00.048 --> 08:53:02.784
ON THIS, BECAUSE IT WOULD SEEM

08:53:02.850 --> 08:53:03.985
THAT THAT SHOULD BE THE

08:53:04.052 --> 08:53:06.254
REQUIREMENT ACROSS THE BOARD.

08:53:06.321 --> 08:53:07.455
AGAIN, NOT SURE THAT WE CAN

08:53:07.522 --> 08:53:09.090
APPLY THIS TO FEDERAL LAW

08:53:09.157 --> 08:53:11.793
ENFORCEMENT. SO THAT'S ANOTHER

08:53:11.859 --> 08:53:14.095
ISSUE WITH IT. BUT THE

08:53:14.162 --> 08:53:15.163
PRINCIPLE OF ENSURING THAT ALL

08:53:15.229 --> 08:53:16.964
LAW ENFORCEMENT, YOU KNOW, WHEN

08:53:17.031 --> 08:53:18.032
YOU'RE GIVING THAT POWER, THAT

08:53:18.099 --> 08:53:19.934
YOU IDENTIFY YOURSELF, YOU HAVE

08:53:20.001 --> 08:53:22.070
A BADGE COMBINED WITH, AGAIN,

08:53:22.136 --> 08:53:24.539
WE ARE SEEING ISSUES OF DOXING.

08:53:24.605 --> 08:53:26.407
WE ARE SEEING ISSUES OF OF LAW

08:53:26.474 --> 08:53:28.576
ENFORCEMENT BEING THREATENED.

08:53:28.643 --> 08:53:31.012
AND SO THERE IS A BALANCE THERE.

08:53:31.079 --> 08:53:32.380
AND SO I SORT OF STRUGGLE

08:53:32.447 --> 08:53:34.415
THROUGH THOSE ISSUES. BUT I DO

08:53:34.482 --> 08:53:36.017
SEE THIS AS A MUCH MORE

08:53:36.084 --> 08:53:37.785
REASONABLE APPROACH TO DEALING

08:53:37.852 --> 08:53:40.021
WITH THE ISSUE. I ALSO THIS

08:53:40.088 --> 08:53:42.156
THIS BILL DOESN'T DEAL WITH

08:53:42.223 --> 08:53:43.324
QUALIFIED IMMUNITY, WHICH I WAS

08:53:43.391 --> 08:53:44.225
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT IN THE

08:53:44.292 --> 08:53:46.160
PREVIOUS BILL THAT WE DISCUSSED.

08:53:46.227 --> 08:53:47.995
WHEN YOU'RE TAKING AWAY THE

08:53:48.062 --> 08:53:49.163
QUALIFIED IMMUNITY THAT

08:53:49.230 --> 08:53:50.264
PROTECTS OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT

08:53:50.331 --> 08:53:52.066
OFFICERS WHO PUT THEIR LIVES ON

08:53:52.133 --> 08:53:54.168
THE LINE EACH AND EVERY DAY,

08:53:54.235 --> 08:53:55.770
THAT IS NOT PRESENT IN THIS

08:53:55.837 --> 08:53:57.004
BILL. SO I APPRECIATE THE

08:53:57.071 --> 08:53:59.507
AUTHOR AND NOT HAVING THAT AS

08:53:59.574 --> 08:54:00.942
PART OF THIS BILL. AND SO

08:54:01.008 --> 08:54:04.579
ANYWAY, THAT'S FOR ME IN HAVING

08:54:04.645 --> 08:54:05.680
THIS CONVERSATION AND LISTENING

08:54:05.747 --> 08:54:07.515
TO MY COLLEAGUES AND THE ISSUES

08:54:07.582 --> 08:54:09.617
THAT THEY'VE RAISED, THIS IS

08:54:09.684 --> 08:54:10.385
SOMETHING I AM, I AM THINKING

08:54:10.451 --> 08:54:13.054
ABOUT SUPPORTING. THANK YOU.

08:54:13.121 --> 08:54:15.223
ASSEMBLYMEMBER GALLAGHER,

08:54:15.289 --> 08:54:16.023
ASSEMBLYMEMBER MARK GONZALEZ,

08:54:16.090 --> 08:54:18.726
YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU,

08:54:18.793 --> 08:54:19.627
MR. SPEAKER. COLLEAGUES, WE'VE

08:54:19.694 --> 08:54:21.195
ALL HEARD THE STORY OF CHICKEN

08:54:21.262 --> 08:54:23.698
LITTLE, THE ONE WHO RUNS AROUND

08:54:23.765 --> 08:54:24.499
YELLING THAT THE SKY IS FALLING.

08:54:24.565 --> 08:54:26.200
WELL, TODAY WE'RE HEARING A NEW

08:54:26.267 --> 08:54:28.970
VERSION THAT IF WE PASS SB 805,

08:54:29.036 --> 08:54:31.139
SOMEHOW THE SKY WILL COLLAPSE.

08:54:31.205 --> 08:54:32.940
LET'S BE CLEAR. THE SKY IS NOT

08:54:33.007 --> 08:54:34.275
FALLING. WHAT IS FALLING IS THE
