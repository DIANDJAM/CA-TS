TWO SECONDS THAT THEY SAID THEY

00:55:22.419 --> 00:55:25.021
WERE. SO WE DO NOT HAVE A

00:55:25.088 --> 00:55:26.256

00:55:26.322 --> 00:55:28.458
SUBCOMMITTEE. AND THE MOMENT WE

PAUSE THE PROCEEDINGS AND

00:55:33.296 --> 00:55:35.331
ESTABLISH THAT QUORUM. AT THIS

00:55:35.398 --> 00:55:38.501
TIME, WE ARE HEARING ONE

00:55:38.568 --> 00:55:43.206
PARTICULAR BILL. IT IS SB 63 BY

00:55:43.273 --> 00:55:45.375
SENATOR WIENER. THIS BILL WAS

00:55:45.442 --> 00:55:47.210
HEARD IN OUR COMMITTEE ON JULY

00:55:47.277 --> 00:55:49.312
7TH AND PASSED OUT WITH THE

00:55:49.379 --> 00:55:50.380
UNDERSTANDING THAT IT WOULD BE

00:55:50.447 --> 00:55:51.781
AMENDED SIGNIFICANTLY ONCE IT

00:55:51.848 --> 00:55:53.349
LEFT OUR COMMITTEE. THIS BILL

00:55:53.416 --> 00:55:55.452
HAS BEEN AMENDED QUITE A FEW

00:55:55.518 --> 00:55:57.420
TIMES SINCE THEN, AND TODAY WE

00:55:57.487 --> 00:55:59.289
WILL DISCUSS THOSE AMENDMENTS

00:55:59.355 --> 00:56:00.990
AND CONSIDER ADDITIONAL

00:56:01.057 --> 00:56:02.592
AMENDMENTS. WITH THAT, I WOULD

00:56:02.659 --> 00:56:04.494
LIKE TO INVITE THE AUTHOR TO

00:56:04.561 --> 00:56:06.129
OPEN ON THE BILL. AND AS I

00:56:06.196 --> 00:56:08.164
UNDERSTAND IT, SENATOR ERIC

00:56:08.231 --> 00:56:10.366
HÌNH, AS A COAUTHOR, WILL ALSO

00:56:10.433 --> 00:56:15.138
BE PROVIDING TESTIMONY. OKAY.

00:56:15.205 --> 00:56:18.775
THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH,

00:56:18.842 --> 00:56:20.577
MADAM CHAIR. AND TWO SECONDS IS

00:56:20.643 --> 00:56:23.847
A VERY ABSTRACT COMMENT OR

00:56:23.913 --> 00:56:26.416
CONCEPT. THANK YOU FOR HEARING

00:56:26.483 --> 00:56:29.886
THE BILL TODAY AND THANK YOU

00:56:29.953 --> 00:56:30.453
FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS

00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:33.156
BILL. AND THANK YOU FOR THE

00:56:33.223 --> 00:56:35.325
LATITUDE BETWEEN THE LAST

00:56:35.391 --> 00:56:37.560
HEARING AND NOW TO BE ABLE TO

00:56:37.627 --> 00:56:40.163
CONTINUE WORKING ON IT. THIS

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:43.833
BILL REFLECTS REALLY MULTIPLE

00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:46.870
YEARS OF COUNTY BY COUNTY WORK,

00:56:46.936 --> 00:56:49.773
PARTICULARLY OVER THE PAST YEAR,

00:56:49.839 --> 00:56:52.175
WHERE WITH AN INTENSIVE

00:56:52.242 --> 00:56:55.145
NEGOTIATION AMONG FIVE COUNTIES

00:56:55.211 --> 00:56:58.915
TO BE TO ENSURE THAT BART DOES

00:56:58.982 --> 00:57:00.617
NOT COLLAPSE. BECAUSE I WANT TO

00:57:00.683 --> 00:57:03.820
BE CRYSTAL CLEAR, WITHOUT THIS,

00:57:03.887 --> 00:57:05.655
BART WILL COLLAPSE. AND I'M NOT

00:57:05.722 --> 00:57:06.790
BEING MELODRAMATIC WHEN I SAY

00:57:06.856 --> 00:57:08.291
THAT BART WILL BE A SHADOW OF

00:57:08.358 --> 00:57:11.361
WHAT IT WAS. MUNI WILL HAVE TO

00:57:11.427 --> 00:57:14.030
CUT SERVICE BY UP TO 50%. ONE

00:57:14.097 --> 00:57:16.399
HALF OF MUNI SERVICE WILL GO

00:57:16.466 --> 00:57:20.336
AWAY. AC TRANSIT, CALTRAIN.

00:57:20.403 --> 00:57:22.105
MASSIVE SERVICE CUTS. I'M NOT

00:57:22.172 --> 00:57:25.141
BEING DRAMATIC. THIS IS FACTUAL.

00:57:25.208 --> 00:57:28.344
AND SO STARTING ACTUALLY TWO

00:57:28.411 --> 00:57:31.214
AND A HALF YEARS AGO, WE BEGAN

00:57:31.281 --> 00:57:34.350
WE WE SAW THIS COMING. THESE

00:57:34.417 --> 00:57:37.220
THE BAY AREA TRANSIT SYSTEM

00:57:37.287 --> 00:57:39.889
STRUCTURAL FINANCIAL PROBLEMS

00:57:39.956 --> 00:57:41.391
LONG PREDATED THE PANDEMIC. WE

00:57:41.457 --> 00:57:43.359
PEOPLE BLAME THE PANDEMIC. THIS

00:57:43.426 --> 00:57:44.627
HAS BEEN A PROBLEM FOR A LONG

00:57:44.694 --> 00:57:46.629
TIME, BECAUSE THE STATE OF

00:57:46.696 --> 00:57:47.330
CALIFORNIA DOESN'T DO ENOUGH

00:57:47.397 --> 00:57:48.665
FOR TRANSIT. AND WE'VE KNOWN

00:57:48.731 --> 00:57:51.668
FOR A LONG TIME THAT WE NEED A

00:57:51.734 --> 00:57:53.369
LONGER TERM STRUCTURAL FIX. AND

00:57:53.436 --> 00:57:54.237
THERE WAS WORK BEFORE THE

00:57:54.304 --> 00:57:56.639
PANDEMIC TO DO THAT. IT GOT PUT

00:57:56.706 --> 00:57:57.607
ON HOLD FOR A VARIETY OF

00:57:57.674 --> 00:57:58.741
REASONS. THE PANDEMIC HIT AND

00:57:58.808 --> 00:58:00.310
MADE THINGS WORSE AND PUT A

00:58:00.376 --> 00:58:02.111
SPOTLIGHT ON IT. AND THE

00:58:02.178 --> 00:58:03.479
SYSTEMS ARE RECOVERING, BUT THE

00:58:03.546 --> 00:58:05.715
STRUCTURAL PROBLEM PERSISTS,

00:58:05.782 --> 00:58:06.516
AND IT'S EVEN WORSE. AND SO

00:58:06.583 --> 00:58:08.218
SEVERAL YEARS AGO, WE STARTED

00:58:08.284 --> 00:58:11.521
ON THE PATH OF HOW DO WE

00:58:11.588 --> 00:58:13.289
ACTUALLY GET THERE TO STABILIZE

00:58:13.356 --> 00:58:14.657
THESE SYSTEMS WITHOUT HAVING TO

00:58:14.724 --> 00:58:17.193
GO BACK TO THE STATE EVERY YEAR.

00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:19.295
WE STARTED OUT WITH A PROPOSED

00:58:19.362 --> 00:58:20.263
BRIDGE TOLL INCREASE, AS THE

00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:23.066
CHAIR WILL REMEMBER, AND OTHERS

00:58:23.132 --> 00:58:24.500
AS WELL. I THOUGHT THAT WAS A

00:58:24.567 --> 00:58:26.269
GOOD IDEA. IT DID NOT GO OVER

00:58:26.336 --> 00:58:28.738
VERY WELL AND SO WE PULLED BACK

00:58:28.805 --> 00:58:30.106
ON THE BRIDGE TOLL INCREASE. WE

00:58:30.173 --> 00:58:32.275
THEN LAST YEAR INTRODUCED A

00:58:32.342 --> 00:58:33.610
REVENUE MEASURE THAT PASSED THE

00:58:33.676 --> 00:58:35.411
SENATE, BUT BECAUSE OF INTERNAL

00:58:35.478 --> 00:58:37.513
DISSENSION, PARTICULARLY SANTA

00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:39.949
CLARA COUNTY WAS VERY, VERY

00:58:40.016 --> 00:58:42.085
UNHAPPY AND DECIDED WE NEEDED

00:58:42.151 --> 00:58:43.553
FURTHER CONVERSATION. AND SO WE

00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:45.555
HIT THE PAUSE BUTTON RATHER

00:58:45.622 --> 00:58:47.123
THAN POTENTIALLY CREATE LONGER

00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:50.260
TERM RANCOR WITHIN THE REGION.

00:58:50.326 --> 00:58:52.161
SO WE HIT THE PAUSE BUTTON. AND,

00:58:52.228 --> 00:58:54.697
SENATOR, I'LL ASK YOU TO PAUSE

00:58:54.764 --> 00:58:56.366
FOR ONE MOMENT. SECRETARY, CAN

00:58:56.432 --> 00:59:00.103
WE PLEASE ESTABLISH A QUORUM?

00:59:00.169 --> 00:59:03.606
WILSON IS HERE. DAVIES IS HERE.

00:59:03.673 --> 00:59:05.408
AGUIAR-CURRY AARONS. CARILLO.

00:59:05.475 --> 00:59:07.277
OH, SORRY. AARON'S HERE.

00:59:07.343 --> 00:59:10.980
CARILLO GARABEDIAN. HEART IS

00:59:11.047 --> 00:59:13.516
HERE. HOOVER. JACKSON IS HERE.

00:59:13.583 --> 00:59:15.885
LACKEY IS HERE. LOWENTHAL,

00:59:15.952 --> 00:59:18.421
MACEDO. MACEDO IS HERE. HAPPEN

00:59:18.488 --> 00:59:20.456
IS HERE. RANSOM PRESENT. RANSOM

00:59:20.523 --> 00:59:22.492
IS PRESENT. ROGERS IS HERE.

00:59:22.558 --> 00:59:24.294
WARD IS HERE. WE HAVE A QUORUM.

00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:26.362
ALL RIGHT, WE ESTABLISH A

00:59:26.429 --> 00:59:27.630
QUORUM. THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

00:59:27.697 --> 00:59:29.432
SO AFTER WE HAD INTERNAL

00:59:29.499 --> 00:59:31.267
DISSENSION AMONG THE COUNTIES

00:59:31.334 --> 00:59:33.136
LAST YEAR, WE HIT THE PAUSE

00:59:33.202 --> 00:59:35.004
BUTTON SO WE COULD HAVE

00:59:35.071 --> 00:59:35.571
CONTINUED CONVERSATION. AND

00:59:35.638 --> 00:59:37.607
THEN WE ENTERED THIS YEAR

00:59:37.674 --> 00:59:38.441
THINKING THAT THIS MEASURE

00:59:38.508 --> 00:59:40.576
MIGHT BE A THREE COUNTY MEASURE.

00:59:40.643 --> 00:59:42.178
CONTRA COSTA, ALAMEDA AND SAN

00:59:42.245 --> 00:59:45.481
FRANCISCO COUNTIES. AND WITH

00:59:45.548 --> 00:59:47.984
THE HOPE AND THE INVITATION TO

00:59:48.051 --> 00:59:50.553
SAN MATEO COUNTY AND SANTA

00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:53.489
CLARA COUNTY TO JOIN, I THOUGHT

00:59:53.556 --> 00:59:55.224
THAT THERE WAS A PATH WITH SAN

00:59:55.291 --> 00:59:56.459
MATEO COUNTY. I THOUGHT THERE

00:59:56.526 --> 00:59:58.828
WAS NO PATH WITH SANTA CLARA

00:59:58.895 --> 00:59:59.629
COUNTY COMING INTO THIS YEAR.

00:59:59.696 --> 01:00:02.365
AND OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR,

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:03.633
INCREDIBLY PRODUCTIVE

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:05.301
CONVERSATIONS AMONG THE FIVE

01:00:05.368 --> 01:00:06.302
COUNTIES HAPPENED. I WANT TO BE

01:00:06.369 --> 01:00:08.438
CLEAR, THIS WAS NOT LIKE ME

01:00:08.504 --> 01:00:09.339
WAKING UP ONE DAY AND SAYING,

01:00:09.405 --> 01:00:11.708
I'M GOING TO WRITE A BILL WITH

01:00:11.774 --> 01:00:12.575
THIS EXPENDITURE PLAN. THIS WAS

01:00:12.642 --> 01:00:13.576
A NEGOTIATED EXPENDITURE PLAN

01:00:13.643 --> 01:00:15.178
AMONG THE FIVE COUNTIES AND

01:00:15.244 --> 01:00:17.880
WITH THE OPERATORS, AND WE MADE

01:00:17.947 --> 01:00:19.615
INCREDIBLE PROGRESS WITH BOTH

01:00:19.682 --> 01:00:21.384
SAN MATEO COUNTY AND SANTA

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:23.286
CLARA COUNTY. AND I AM SO

01:00:23.353 --> 01:00:25.455
GRATEFUL FOR THE BROAD LOCAL

01:00:25.521 --> 01:00:27.190
PARTICIPATION IN BOTH COUNTIES.

01:00:27.256 --> 01:00:29.292
I HAD MANY, MANY CONVERSATIONS

01:00:29.359 --> 01:00:31.561
WITH LOCAL ELECTEDS IN BOTH

01:00:31.627 --> 01:00:34.664
COUNTIES. AND ULTIMATELY, LAST

01:00:34.731 --> 01:00:36.366
MONTH, SAN MATEO COUNTY AND

01:00:36.432 --> 01:00:39.202
SANTA CLARA COUNTY OPTED IN. IN

01:00:39.268 --> 01:00:42.338
SAN MATEO COUNTY, IT WAS THE

01:00:42.405 --> 01:00:44.474
SAMTRANS BOARD VOTED TO OPT IN.

01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:45.208
THE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION

01:00:45.274 --> 01:00:47.477
AUTHORITY, CALTRAIN CÁC, WHICH

01:00:47.543 --> 01:00:49.245
IS A LOCAL GOVERNMENT GROUP,

01:00:49.312 --> 01:00:51.414
AND THEN THE VTA BOARD OF

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:52.548
DIRECTORS, WITH THE SUPPORT OF

01:00:52.615 --> 01:00:54.617
MAYOR MEHAN AND THE BOARD OF

01:00:54.684 --> 01:00:56.352
SUPERVISORS, VOTED TO OPT IN.

01:00:56.419 --> 01:00:59.622
AND SO WE HAVE THIS VERY, VERY

01:00:59.689 --> 01:01:00.423
HEAVILY NEGOTIATED EXPENDITURE

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:03.426
PLAN. I THINK IT IS VERY SOLID.

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:06.462
IT WILL CREATE BE FUNDED BY A

01:01:06.529 --> 01:01:08.898
HALF CENT SALES TAX IN FOUR

01:01:08.965 --> 01:01:10.433
COUNTIES. ONE COUNTY, SAN

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.201
FRANCISCO, WILL BE A FULL CENT

01:01:12.268 --> 01:01:14.237
SALES TAX. SO I'M ASKING MY

01:01:14.303 --> 01:01:17.840
CITY, MY NEIGHBORS TO PAY A

01:01:17.907 --> 01:01:19.475
FULL CENT INSTEAD OF THE HALF

01:01:19.542 --> 01:01:21.277
CENT, BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE TO DO

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:22.678
OUR PART. AND SAN FRANCISCO

01:01:22.745 --> 01:01:25.782
SITS AT THE HUB OF A LOT OF

01:01:25.848 --> 01:01:30.119
THESE SYSTEMS. THE BILL SETS UP

01:01:30.186 --> 01:01:34.090
A VERY STRONG ACCOUNTABILITY

01:01:34.157 --> 01:01:37.693
MECHANISM. I WANT TO FIRST OF

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:39.529
ALL, WE'VE FOR QUITE SOME TIME

01:01:39.595 --> 01:01:41.631
HAS HAD A FINANCIAL EFFICIENCY

01:01:41.697 --> 01:01:43.533
REVIEW TO TRY TO REALLY MAKE

01:01:43.599 --> 01:01:44.367
SURE THAT THESE SYSTEMS ARE

01:01:44.434 --> 01:01:46.702
BEING AS EFFICIENT AS THEY CAN

01:01:46.769 --> 01:01:50.339
BE. WHEN SOME QUESTIONS CAME UP,

01:01:50.406 --> 01:01:51.607
PARTICULARLY IN SAN MATEO

01:01:51.674 --> 01:01:53.176
COUNTY, ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY,

01:01:53.242 --> 01:01:54.544
AND I WANT TO JUST ACKNOWLEDGE

01:01:54.610 --> 01:01:56.512
THAT I REPRESENT ALMOST 20% OF

01:01:56.579 --> 01:01:58.381
SAN MATEO COUNTY, NOT AS MUCH

01:01:58.448 --> 01:02:00.383
AS MY COLLEAGUE MISS PAPPIN,

01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:03.252
BUT I REPRESENT AND I REPRESENT

01:02:03.319 --> 01:02:05.888
A PRETTY TRANSIT DEPENDENT PART

01:02:05.955 --> 01:02:07.690
OF THE COUNTY. AND THERE WERE

01:02:07.757 --> 01:02:08.558
CONCERNS ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY

01:02:08.624 --> 01:02:09.759
BECAUSE SAN MATEO COUNTY DOES

01:02:09.826 --> 01:02:11.594
NOT HAVE REPRESENTATION ON THE

01:02:11.661 --> 01:02:13.529
BART BOARD OR ON MUNI, BECAUSE

01:02:13.596 --> 01:02:15.331
SAN MATEO COUNTY 60 YEARS AGO

01:02:15.398 --> 01:02:19.135
DECIDED TO OPT OUT OF BART AND

01:02:19.202 --> 01:02:21.304
WANTING ENHANCED ACCOUNTABILITY.

01:02:21.370 --> 01:02:22.605
SENATOR RG, MY JOINT AUTHOR,

01:02:22.672 --> 01:02:24.907
I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO SENATOR

01:02:24.974 --> 01:02:25.875
ORIGENES COLLABORATION. WE

01:02:25.942 --> 01:02:27.110
PROPOSED AN ACCOUNTABILITY

01:02:27.176 --> 01:02:29.312
MECHANISM WITH A TEN MEMBER

01:02:29.378 --> 01:02:31.380
BOARD THAT IF COUNTIES HAD

01:02:31.447 --> 01:02:32.248
CONCERNS, THEY COULD FILE A

01:02:32.315 --> 01:02:34.350
COMPLAINT WITH THE BOARD AND UP

01:02:34.417 --> 01:02:37.153
UP TO 5% OF THAT OPERATOR'S

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:38.521
FUNDING COULD BE WITHHELD UNTIL

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:40.490
THE PROBLEM WAS RESOLVED. WE

01:02:40.556 --> 01:02:42.592
HAVE A DIFFERENT APPROACH TODAY

01:02:42.658 --> 01:02:43.392
THAT THE CHAIR HAS PROPOSED,

01:02:43.459 --> 01:02:45.061
AND I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE'S

01:02:45.128 --> 01:02:47.296
AMENDMENTS, THAT IF A COUNTY

01:02:47.363 --> 01:02:49.365
HAS AN ISSUE WITH AN OPERATOR,

01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:51.767
THERE WILL BE BODIES SPECIFIC

01:02:51.834 --> 01:02:54.437
TO EACH OPERATOR WITH ONLY THE

01:02:54.504 --> 01:02:56.372
COUNTIES THAT ARE THAT ARE THAT

01:02:56.439 --> 01:02:58.708
HAVE THOSE OPERATORS. SO

01:02:58.774 --> 01:03:00.276
CALTRAIN WOULD BE WOULD BE

01:03:00.343 --> 01:03:01.511
SANTA CLARA, SAN MATEO, SAN

01:03:01.577 --> 01:03:03.479
FRANCISCO COUNTIES. BART WOULD

01:03:03.546 --> 01:03:05.281
BE FOUR OF THE FIVE COUNTIES,

01:03:05.348 --> 01:03:06.516
INCLUDING SAN MATEO. AC TRANSIT

01:03:06.582 --> 01:03:07.717
WOULD BE CONTRA COSTA AND

01:03:07.783 --> 01:03:10.153
ALAMEDA, ETC. YOU COULD FILE A

01:03:10.219 --> 01:03:12.555
COMPLAINT AND THEN AFTER AN

01:03:12.622 --> 01:03:13.689
OPPORTUNITY TO CURE, IF IT'S

01:03:13.756 --> 01:03:15.858
NOT CURED, THE BOARD, TWO

01:03:15.925 --> 01:03:17.126
COMMISSIONERS FROM EACH OF

01:03:17.193 --> 01:03:19.362
THOSE OF THE IMPACTED COUNTIES

01:03:19.428 --> 01:03:22.265
COULD VOTE TO WITHHOLD 3.5% OF

01:03:22.331 --> 01:03:24.433
THAT OPERATOR'S ALLOCATIONS FOR

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:26.903
THE FIRST 90 DAYS. AND IF IT'S

01:03:26.969 --> 01:03:29.505
NOT RESOLVED BY DAY 90, IT CAN

01:03:29.572 --> 01:03:32.708
WITHHOLD UP TO 7%. AND THEN

01:03:32.775 --> 01:03:35.144
AFTER 180 DAYS, A MAJORITY OF

01:03:35.211 --> 01:03:37.346
THE BOARD COULD RELEASE THE

01:03:37.413 --> 01:03:39.348
MONEY. IF THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN

01:03:39.415 --> 01:03:41.317
RESOLVED. AND IF THERE'S A TIE

01:03:41.384 --> 01:03:43.386
FOR THE INITIAL WITHHOLDING,

01:03:43.452 --> 01:03:46.589
THE TIE GOES TO WITHHOLDING. SO

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:49.525
THIS IS A VERY, VERY REAL

01:03:49.592 --> 01:03:51.460
THREAT TO AN OPERATOR THAT'S

01:03:51.527 --> 01:03:53.162
NOT DOING WHAT IT NEEDS TO DO.

01:03:53.229 --> 01:03:54.397
AND I AM VERY APPRECIATIVE TO

01:03:54.463 --> 01:03:56.332
THE CHAIR AND HER STAFF FOR

01:03:56.399 --> 01:03:57.934
SOME CREATIVE THINKING AROUND

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.336
THIS. I WANT TO JUST SAY THAT

01:04:00.403 --> 01:04:02.238
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IS PART

01:04:02.305 --> 01:04:04.307
OF THE BAY AREA'S LIFEBLOOD.

01:04:04.373 --> 01:04:06.409
THE BAY AREA WOULD NOT BE THE

01:04:06.475 --> 01:04:07.243
BAY AREA WITHOUT TRANSIT, AND

01:04:07.310 --> 01:04:09.579
WE SAW IT AGAIN LAST FRIDAY

01:04:09.645 --> 01:04:11.113
WHEN BART, UNFORTUNATELY HAD A

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:13.616
COMPUTER GLITCH. AND SO THE

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:14.483
SYSTEM WAS DOWN. AND THIS HAS

01:04:14.550 --> 01:04:16.485
HAPPENED A FEW TIMES, AND THEY

01:04:16.552 --> 01:04:18.621
NEED TO GET THAT COMPUTER

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:20.189
IMPROVED. BUT EVEN WHEN BART

01:04:20.256 --> 01:04:23.359
GOES DOWN FOR 2 OR 3 HOURS, TRY

01:04:23.426 --> 01:04:24.594
GETTING ANYWHERE ON THE ROADS

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:26.262
OF THE BAY AREA. NOT ONLY DO WE

01:04:26.329 --> 01:04:28.397
HAVE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T GET TO

01:04:28.464 --> 01:04:29.265
WORK OR SCHOOL ON BART, BUT

01:04:29.332 --> 01:04:31.601
PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO DRIVE

01:04:31.667 --> 01:04:32.468
CAN'T GET WHERE THEY'RE GOING

01:04:32.535 --> 01:04:35.238
EITHER. THIS IS REAL. THIS IS

01:04:35.304 --> 01:04:37.740
HIGH STAKES. WE NEED TO GET

01:04:37.807 --> 01:04:39.342
THIS TO THE REGION SO THAT THE

01:04:39.408 --> 01:04:41.410
BAY AREA CAN ENGAGE IN

01:04:41.477 --> 01:04:43.179
SELF-HELP. AGAIN, I'M SO

01:04:43.246 --> 01:04:45.414
GRATEFUL TO THE MANY PEOPLE

01:04:45.481 --> 01:04:46.549
AROUND THE REGION WHO HAVE

01:04:46.616 --> 01:04:48.351
PARTICIPATED IN THIS PROCESS,

01:04:48.417 --> 01:04:50.119
AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN

01:04:50.186 --> 01:04:52.655
AYE VOTE. AND IF SENATOR

01:04:52.722 --> 01:04:54.557
ARREGUIN HAS A FEW REMARKS,

01:04:54.624 --> 01:04:56.225
MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU, MADAM

01:04:56.292 --> 01:04:58.361
CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I

01:04:58.427 --> 01:05:00.529
DON'T WANT TO REPEAT. I THINK

01:05:00.596 --> 01:05:01.664
THE GREAT PRESENTATION SENATOR

01:05:01.731 --> 01:05:02.365
WIENER PROVIDED, BUT I JUST

01:05:02.431 --> 01:05:04.367
WANT TO PUT THIS IN CONTEXT.

01:05:04.433 --> 01:05:05.568
ONCE AGAIN, SENATOR WIENER

01:05:05.635 --> 01:05:07.403
TOUCHED UPON THE COMPUTER

01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:09.639
GLITCH THAT SHUT DOWN THE

01:05:09.705 --> 01:05:11.807
ENTIRE BART SYSTEM LAST FRIDAY,

01:05:11.874 --> 01:05:13.242
WHICH RESULTED IN MASSIVE

01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:15.044
TRAFFIC JAMS THROUGHOUT THE BAY

01:05:15.111 --> 01:05:16.712
AREA. THAT WILL BE A DAILY

01:05:16.779 --> 01:05:19.482
REALITY IF WE DO NOT PASS SB 63

01:05:19.548 --> 01:05:20.283
AND SUCCEED AT GETTING IT

01:05:20.349 --> 01:05:22.418
PASSED AT THE BALLOT BOX. AND

01:05:22.485 --> 01:05:24.387
JUST TO PUT THIS IN CONTEXT,

01:05:24.453 --> 01:05:25.588
SOME PEOPLE SAID, WELL, LET'S

01:05:25.655 --> 01:05:27.323
TAKE MORE TIME. WE CAN'T WAIT.

01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:28.591
WE KNOW THAT WE'RE FACING A

01:05:28.658 --> 01:05:30.226
FISCAL CLIFF NEXT YEAR, WHILE

01:05:30.293 --> 01:05:32.962
WE ARE WORKING TO TRY TO GET

01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:33.562
THE GOVERNOR TO AGREE TO THE

01:05:33.629 --> 01:05:35.164
$750 MILLION LOAN THAT WAS IN

01:05:35.231 --> 01:05:36.432
THE BUDGET ACT TO PROVIDE AT

01:05:36.499 --> 01:05:38.434
LEAST ONE YEAR'S BRIDGE FUNDING.

01:05:38.501 --> 01:05:40.336
AFTER THAT, THERE IS NO PLAN

01:05:40.403 --> 01:05:41.971
FOR HOW WE'RE GOING TO ENSURE

01:05:42.038 --> 01:05:43.272
THE SOLVENCY OF OUR TRANSIT

01:05:43.339 --> 01:05:45.341
SYSTEMS IN THE BAY AREA. A LOT

01:05:45.408 --> 01:05:46.976
OF WORK HAS BEEN DONE OVER THE

01:05:47.043 --> 01:05:48.477
PAST SEVERAL YEARS BECAUSE OF

01:05:48.544 --> 01:05:49.412
THE BUDGET REALITIES, CUTTING

01:05:49.478 --> 01:05:51.414
STAFF, LOOKING AT EFFICIENCIES,

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:52.948
THE EFFICIENCY REVIEW. THAT'S I

01:05:53.015 --> 01:05:53.816
THINK, A VERY CRITICAL

01:05:53.883 --> 01:05:55.418
COMPONENT OF THIS BILL WILL

01:05:55.484 --> 01:05:57.286
PROVIDE EVEN GREATER FOCUS ON

01:05:57.353 --> 01:05:58.454
HOW THESE AGENCIES CAN LOOK AT

01:05:58.521 --> 01:06:00.423
EITHER THROUGH CONSOLIDATION OF

01:06:00.489 --> 01:06:02.191
OPERATIONS OR LOOKING AT WAYS

01:06:02.258 --> 01:06:04.827
TO IMPROVE SERVICE AND RAISE

01:06:04.894 --> 01:06:07.196
REVENUE. THEY CAN HAVE A LONG

01:06:07.263 --> 01:06:09.398
TERM PLAN FOR FINANCIAL

01:06:09.465 --> 01:06:11.600
SUSTAINABILITY, BECAUSE WE JUST

01:06:11.667 --> 01:06:13.569
DON'T WANT TO GIVE UP. WE DON'T

01:06:13.636 --> 01:06:16.272
WANT TO BE HERE 14 YEARS FROM

01:06:16.339 --> 01:06:18.441
NOW TRYING TO DO ANOTHER SALES

01:06:18.507 --> 01:06:19.709
TAX MEASURE, AND THE VOTERS

01:06:19.775 --> 01:06:20.343
DEMAND ACCOUNTABILITY. IF WE'RE

01:06:20.409 --> 01:06:22.511
GOING TO ASK VOTERS IN THESE

01:06:22.578 --> 01:06:24.180
COUNTIES TO APPROVE A SALES TAX

01:06:24.246 --> 01:06:26.248
INCREASE IN A REGION THAT HAS A

01:06:26.315 --> 01:06:27.616
VERY HIGH COST OF LIVING, THERE

01:06:27.683 --> 01:06:28.818
NEEDS TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY.

01:06:28.884 --> 01:06:30.619
THERE NEEDS TO BE OVERSIGHT. WE

01:06:30.686 --> 01:06:31.520
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE

01:06:31.587 --> 01:06:33.122
DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT

01:06:33.189 --> 01:06:34.323
EFFECTIVELY, AND THAT WE ARE

01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:35.725
MAKING SURE THAT THESE TRANSIT

01:06:35.791 --> 01:06:36.659
SYSTEMS ARE OPERATING

01:06:36.726 --> 01:06:37.360
EFFICIENTLY, THAT WE'RE

01:06:37.426 --> 01:06:39.895
IMPROVING THE RIDER EXPERIENCE,

01:06:39.962 --> 01:06:40.329
THAT WE'RE IMPROVING

01:06:40.396 --> 01:06:40.963
ACCESSIBILITY OF TRANSPORTATION

01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:42.365
IN THE BAY AREA. THAT'S WHAT

01:06:42.431 --> 01:06:44.333
THIS BILL DOES. AND I JUST WANT

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:45.301
TO LIFT UP AS WELL THE

01:06:45.368 --> 01:06:46.168
ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES. I

01:06:46.235 --> 01:06:47.303
WOULD ARGUE, IF SOME OF THE

01:06:47.370 --> 01:06:48.971
STRONGEST ACCOUNTABILITY

01:06:49.038 --> 01:06:49.572
MEASURES OF ANY TAX PROPOSAL

01:06:49.638 --> 01:06:50.339
THAT'S PROBABLY GONE THROUGH

01:06:50.406 --> 01:06:51.273
THIS LEGISLATURE IN RECENT

01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:53.442
MEMORY, AND IT'S REALLY A

01:06:53.509 --> 01:06:54.410
CREDIT TO, I THINK, THE WORK OF

01:06:54.477 --> 01:06:55.878
THE CHAIR, ASSEMBLYMEMBER

01:06:55.945 --> 01:06:57.480
PAPPIN, AND LEADERS THROUGHOUT

01:06:57.546 --> 01:06:59.115
THE BAY AREA AND OPERATORS WHO

01:06:59.181 --> 01:07:00.416
HAVE REALLY COME TO THE TABLE

01:07:00.483 --> 01:07:02.418
IN THE SPIRIT OF TRYING TO

01:07:02.485 --> 01:07:02.985
ENSURE STRONG ACCOUNTABILITY

01:07:03.052 --> 01:07:04.153
AND OVERSIGHT OF THIS MEASURE.

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:06.689
BUT IT'S CRITICAL THAT THIS

01:07:06.756 --> 01:07:07.623
MOVE FORWARD TODAY, WE DON'T

01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:09.425
HAVE A PLAN FOR WHAT'S GOING TO

01:07:09.492 --> 01:07:11.360
HAPPEN IF WE DON'T SUCCEED. WE

01:07:11.427 --> 01:07:13.496
KNOW WHAT THE IMPACTS WILL BE.

01:07:13.562 --> 01:07:15.297
IT WILL LEAVE THOUSANDS AND

01:07:15.364 --> 01:07:16.432
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN THE BAY

01:07:16.499 --> 01:07:18.100
AREA STRANDED, AND THAT WILL

01:07:18.167 --> 01:07:19.835
HAVE ALSO A HUGE IMPACT ON NOT

01:07:19.902 --> 01:07:21.404
JUST THE BAY AREA'S ECONOMY,

01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:22.538
BUT THE ENTIRE STATE OF

01:07:22.605 --> 01:07:23.172
CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. GIVEN THE

01:07:23.239 --> 01:07:24.373
SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANCE OF THE

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:26.475
BAY AREA AS A AS AN ECONOMIC

01:07:26.542 --> 01:07:27.309
ENGINE. SO I JOINED MY MY

01:07:27.376 --> 01:07:28.744
COLLEAGUE IN THANKING THE CHAIR,

01:07:28.811 --> 01:07:30.346

ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU.

01:07:33.582 --> 01:07:36.085
AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT, WE DO

01:07:36.152 --> 01:07:44.427
HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. AS A

01:07:44.493 --> 01:07:45.194

CONVENIENCE. GOOD AFTERNOON,

01:08:11.287 --> 01:08:12.421
CHAIR WILSON AND COMMITTEE

01:08:12.488 --> 01:08:14.657
MEMBERS, SENATORS WIENER AND

01:08:14.723 --> 01:08:15.758
N N. MY NAME IS SEBASTIAN PETTY,

01:08:15.825 --> 01:08:17.326
AND I'M PLEASED TO BE HERE ON

01:08:17.393 --> 01:08:18.527
BEHALF OF SPUR, THE SAN

01:08:18.594 --> 01:08:20.763
FRANCISCO PLANNING AND URBAN

RESEARCH ASSOCIATION, TO

01:08:21.363 --> 01:08:23.766
PROVIDE TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF

01:08:23.833 --> 01:08:27.303
SB 63. SPUR IS SUPPORTED SB 63

01:08:27.369 --> 01:08:28.571
SINCE ITS INCEPTION. BECAUSE WE

01:08:28.637 --> 01:08:30.172
ARE CLEAR EYED THAT THE BAY

01:08:30.239 --> 01:08:31.307
AREA'S TRANSIT SYSTEM IS IN

01:08:31.373 --> 01:08:32.441
DEEP FISCAL CRISIS, AND WE

01:08:32.508 --> 01:08:34.477
UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS OUR

01:08:34.543 --> 01:08:35.711
LAST CHANCE TO GET SUSTAINED

01:08:35.778 --> 01:08:36.779
REGIONAL FUNDING. THE ONLY

01:08:36.846 --> 01:08:38.981
VIABLE PATH TO KEEP OUR BUSSES

01:08:39.048 --> 01:08:41.317
AND TRAINS RUNNING MUNI, BART,

01:08:41.383 --> 01:08:42.685
AC TRANSIT AND CALTRAIN TRANSIT

01:08:42.751 --> 01:08:44.587
AGENCIES THAT COLLECTIVELY

01:08:44.653 --> 01:08:46.322
CARRY MORE THAN 80% OF THE BAY

01:08:46.388 --> 01:08:47.189
AREA'S MILLION PLUS DAILY

01:08:47.256 --> 01:08:49.358
RIDERS ARE AT RISK OF SEVERE

01:08:49.425 --> 01:08:51.360
SERVICE CUTS OVER THE COMING

01:08:51.427 --> 01:08:52.928
YEAR UNLESS THE REGION SECURES

01:08:52.995 --> 01:08:54.330
A NEW REVENUE STREAM. THE

01:08:54.396 --> 01:08:56.165
CRISIS TRANSIT IS FACING IS

01:08:56.232 --> 01:08:58.634
NATIONAL, AND OMINOUSLY, THE

01:08:58.701 --> 01:08:59.435
BAY AREA CAN NOW SEE THE

01:08:59.502 --> 01:09:00.603
POTENTIAL FUTURE. WE ARE TRYING

01:09:00.669 --> 01:09:02.571
TO AVOID STARTING TO PLAY OUT

01:09:02.638 --> 01:09:04.373
IN OTHER STATES AND REGIONS. IN

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:05.574
PENNSYLVANIA, THE STATE HAS

01:09:05.641 --> 01:09:06.375
FAILED TO ADDRESS TRANSIT'S

01:09:06.442 --> 01:09:08.644
FUNDING NEEDS AND CONSEQUENTLY,

01:09:08.711 --> 01:09:09.812
PHILADELPHIA'S TRANSIT SYSTEM,

01:09:09.879 --> 01:09:11.347
SEPTA, HAS MOVED FORWARD WITH

01:09:11.413 --> 01:09:13.315
LARGE SCALE CUTS, THE FIRST

01:09:13.382 --> 01:09:14.683
MAJOR METRO AREA TO HEAD OVER

01:09:14.750 --> 01:09:16.785
THE FISCAL CLIFF. THE RESULT

01:09:16.852 --> 01:09:18.387
HAS BEEN CHAOS. RIDERS HAVE

01:09:18.454 --> 01:09:20.155
BEEN STRANDED. EMPLOYERS ARE

01:09:20.222 --> 01:09:21.423
FRUSTRATED THE CITY IS HAVING

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:23.425
TO BACKFILL FUNDING FOR SOME

01:09:23.492 --> 01:09:24.927
SCHOOL ORIENTED ROUTES FROM ITS

01:09:24.994 --> 01:09:26.428
OWN COFFERS. LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN

01:09:26.495 --> 01:09:28.564
INITIATED OVER OTHER CUTS, AND

01:09:28.631 --> 01:09:30.266
PROFESSIONAL SPORTS TEAMS HAVE

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:31.467
TURNED TO BETTING SITES TO

01:09:31.534 --> 01:09:32.601
TEMPORARILY COVER THE COST OF

01:09:32.668 --> 01:09:35.237
GAME DAY TRANSIT. LONGER TERM,

01:09:35.304 --> 01:09:36.405
BLOOMBERG ESTIMATES THAT THE

01:09:36.472 --> 01:09:37.673
ECONOMIC IMPACT OF SUSTAINED

01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:39.275
TRANSIT CUTS IN PHILADELPHIA IN

01:09:39.341 --> 01:09:40.509
THE PHILADELPHIA REGION WILL

01:09:40.576 --> 01:09:43.646
INCLUDE 76,000 LOST JOBS, 6

01:09:43.712 --> 01:09:45.948
BILLION IN LOST WAGE GROWTH AND

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:47.583
NEARLY 20 BILLION IN IMPACTS TO

01:09:47.650 --> 01:09:49.451
HOME VALUES. THIS IS IN REGARDS

01:09:49.518 --> 01:09:51.120
TO A TRANSIT SYSTEM AND A

01:09:51.186 --> 01:09:52.421
REGION THAT ARE BOTH SMALLER

01:09:52.488 --> 01:09:55.124
THAN THE BAY AREA. THERE IS NO

01:09:55.190 --> 01:09:56.358
OBVIOUS SOLUTION IN SIGHT.

01:09:56.425 --> 01:09:58.360
CITIES LIKE CHICAGO, DALLAS,

01:09:58.427 --> 01:10:00.529
WASHINGTON DC, PORTLAND AND OF

01:10:00.596 --> 01:10:01.430
COURSE THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY

01:10:01.497 --> 01:10:04.066
AREA WILL SOON FACE SIMILAR

01:10:04.133 --> 01:10:04.500
CATASTROPHES WITHOUT

01:10:04.567 --> 01:10:07.403
INTERVENTION, AS SB 63 HAS

01:10:07.469 --> 01:10:07.836
ADVANCED THROUGH THE

01:10:07.903 --> 01:10:09.171
LEGISLATURE. THE THEME OF

01:10:09.238 --> 01:10:10.239
ACCOUNTABILITY HAS

01:10:10.306 --> 01:10:11.640
UNDERSTANDABLY EMERGED AS A

01:10:11.707 --> 01:10:13.275
CRITICAL FOCUS. TRANSIT'S

01:10:13.342 --> 01:10:17.079
FINANCIAL HIÂU ARE SIGNIFICANT.

01:10:17.146 --> 01:10:19.615
THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. NEXT

01:10:19.682 --> 01:10:20.382
WITNESS IS A REMINDER. TWO

01:10:20.449 --> 01:10:21.684
MINUTES. GOOD AFTERNOON, CHAIR

01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:23.185
AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE.

01:10:23.252 --> 01:10:24.353
I'M JASON BAKER, DIRECTOR OF

01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:25.487
GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR CALTRAIN.

01:10:25.554 --> 01:10:26.755
OUR SYSTEM PROVIDES REGIONAL

01:10:26.822 --> 01:10:28.290
RAIL CONNECTION THROUGH SANTA

01:10:28.357 --> 01:10:29.425
CLARA AND SAN MATEO COUNTIES

01:10:29.491 --> 01:10:31.794
AND INTO THE CITY AND COUNTY OF

01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:32.328
SAN FRANCISCO. THANK YOU,

01:10:32.394 --> 01:10:33.796
ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAPAN AND

01:10:33.862 --> 01:10:36.265
AARONS AND CHAIR WILSON. THIS

01:10:36.332 --> 01:10:38.334
EFFORT HAS COME A VERY LONG WAY

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.302
FROM AN IDEA TO SB 3131 TO THE

01:10:40.369 --> 01:10:42.338
BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM, AND

01:10:42.404 --> 01:10:44.440
YOU ALL HAD A GREAT DEAL TO DO

01:10:44.506 --> 01:10:45.374
WITH MAKING THIS BILL BETTER.

01:10:45.441 --> 01:10:47.443
IT TOOK A LONG TIME AND A LOT

01:10:47.509 --> 01:10:49.278
OF AMENDMENTS TO GET TO WHERE

01:10:49.345 --> 01:10:50.479
WE ARE, BUT THIS BILL IS

01:10:50.546 --> 01:10:52.414
SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER AND IT IS

01:10:52.481 --> 01:10:53.415
THE PRODUCT OF A LOT OF TOUGH

01:10:53.482 --> 01:10:54.516
COMPROMISE. THANK YOU, SENATOR

01:10:54.583 --> 01:10:56.285
WIENER AND SENATOR ARAGON OR

01:10:56.352 --> 01:10:57.286
ARAGON FOR YOUR WORK ALONG THE

01:10:57.353 --> 01:10:58.787
WAY. WE PUBLIC TRANSIT

01:10:58.854 --> 01:11:00.823
APPRECIATES IT. I KNOW SOME

01:11:00.889 --> 01:11:02.424
CONCERNS REMAIN, BUT WHAT I

01:11:02.491 --> 01:11:03.259
WANT TO UNDERSCORE IS THAT THIS

01:11:03.325 --> 01:11:05.327
BILL, THIS FUNDING, IS

01:11:05.394 --> 01:11:06.562
ABSOLUTELY VITAL TO CALTRAIN

01:11:06.629 --> 01:11:07.429
AND TO THE SURVIVAL OF TRANSIT

01:11:07.496 --> 01:11:11.000
IN THE BAY AREA. WE TOGETHER

01:11:11.066 --> 01:11:12.201
JUST INVESTED $2.44 BILLION OF

01:11:12.267 --> 01:11:13.469
PUBLIC MONEY TO ELECTRIFY

01:11:13.535 --> 01:11:15.437
CALTRAIN, THE FIRST RAILROAD IN

01:11:15.504 --> 01:11:17.106
THE NATION IN A GENERATION, TO

01:11:17.172 --> 01:11:18.307
DO THAT AT OUR ONE YEAR

01:11:18.374 --> 01:11:19.475
ANNIVERSARY COMING UP IN A

01:11:19.541 --> 01:11:20.743
COUPLE OF WEEKS, IT'S CLEAR

01:11:20.809 --> 01:11:22.211
THAT INVESTMENT IS A SUCCESS.

01:11:22.277 --> 01:11:24.813
OUR RIDERSHIP IS UP OVER 78%

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:26.148
OVER LAST YEAR. OUR FAREBOX

01:11:26.215 --> 01:11:27.850
RECOVERY IS ONCE AGAIN NATION

01:11:27.916 --> 01:11:30.152
LEADING. WE'RE AT 65% OF OUR

01:11:30.219 --> 01:11:31.387
PRE-PANDEMIC RIDERSHIP, AND OUR

01:11:31.453 --> 01:11:33.889
WEEKEND SERVICE IS OVER 100% OF

01:11:33.956 --> 01:11:36.592
OUR PRE-PANDEMIC RIDERSHIP. BUT

01:11:36.659 --> 01:11:38.460
WITHOUT THIS FUNDING, THAT

01:11:38.527 --> 01:11:39.194
INVESTMENT, CALTRAIN AND ITS

01:11:39.261 --> 01:11:41.330
SUCCESS STORY WILL NOT CONTINUE.

01:11:41.397 --> 01:11:43.232
THERE IS NO OTHER OPTION, I

01:11:43.298 --> 01:11:45.334
TELL YOU IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS

01:11:45.401 --> 01:11:46.535
THAT CALTRAIN SERVICE WITHOUT

01:11:46.602 --> 01:11:48.637
THIS LIFELINE WOULD LOOK VERY,

01:11:48.704 --> 01:11:50.906
VERY DIFFERENT. WE WOULD LIKELY

01:11:50.973 --> 01:11:53.542
HAVE TO CUT WEEKEND SERVICE

01:11:53.609 --> 01:11:54.309
THAT'S BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL. LOOK

01:11:54.376 --> 01:11:56.111
AT SKIPPING STOPS, SOME

01:11:56.178 --> 01:11:57.212
CLOSURES OF STATIONS, AND

01:11:57.279 --> 01:11:58.380
POTENTIALLY GOING TO HOURLY

01:11:58.447 --> 01:12:01.884
SERVICE. AND THE WORST THING IS,

01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:02.484
WE'RE NOT CONFIDENT THAT EVEN

01:12:02.551 --> 01:12:03.519
THOSE DRACONIAN CUTS WOULD SAVE

01:12:03.585 --> 01:12:05.387
CALTRAIN, BECAUSE FOR CALTRAIN,

01:12:05.454 --> 01:12:07.523
CUTS MEAN AN UNKNOWN BUT

01:12:07.589 --> 01:12:08.357
DEFINITELY SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF

01:12:08.424 --> 01:12:10.459
RIDERSHIP AND FAREBOX RECOVERY.

01:12:10.526 --> 01:12:12.461
SO YOU CUT TO SAVE, AND YOU MAY

01:12:12.528 --> 01:12:14.196
END UP COSTING YOURSELF AS MUCH

01:12:14.263 --> 01:12:16.265
OR MORE THAN YOU THAN YOU SAVE

01:12:16.331 --> 01:12:17.933
BECAUSE YOU LOSE FAREBOX

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.669
RECOVERY. WE'VE COME A LONG WAY.

01:12:20.736 --> 01:12:22.705
WE URGE YOU TO GIVE VOTERS THE

01:12:22.771 --> 01:12:23.605
CHANCE TO SAVE THE BAY AREA

01:12:23.672 --> 01:12:25.274
TRANSIT. WE THINK THEY'LL DO IT.

01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:27.509
AND THE BAY AREA, OUR ECONOMY,

01:12:27.576 --> 01:12:28.477
OUR AIR AND OUR QUALITY OF LIFE

01:12:28.544 --> 01:12:30.345
WILL BE MUCH BETTER. THANK YOU.

01:12:30.412 --> 01:12:33.115
THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. NOW

01:17:16.465 --> 01:17:21.837
HEART LACKING A QUESTION ABOUT

01:17:21.903 --> 01:17:23.505
PETITION FILING PROCESS AND HOW

01:17:23.572 --> 01:17:25.540
THAT WOULD WORK. THANK YOU. THE

01:17:25.607 --> 01:17:26.308
PETITION FILING PROCESS AND HOW

01:17:26.375 --> 01:17:29.478
THAT WOULD WORK FOR THE AD HOC

01:17:29.544 --> 01:17:30.779
COMMITTEES AND WHAT THE

01:17:30.846 --> 01:17:32.247
LIMITATIONS ARE FOR THEM. SURE.

01:17:32.314 --> 01:17:34.149
SO THE AD HOC COMMITTEES, THE

01:17:34.216 --> 01:17:36.685
WAY IT WOULD WORK IS EACH

01:17:36.752 --> 01:17:39.521
OPERATOR WILL HAVE ITS OWN

01:17:39.588 --> 01:17:41.857
COMMITTEE THAT WILL HAVE TWO

01:17:41.923 --> 01:17:45.594
MTC COMMISSIONERS FROM THE

01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:47.396
COVERED COUNTIES. SO FOR AC

01:17:47.462 --> 01:17:48.563
TRANSIT WOULD BE TWO FROM

01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:50.365
CONTRA COSTA, TWO FROM ALAMEDA,

01:17:50.432 --> 01:17:52.467
CALTRAIN WOULD BE TWO EACH FROM

01:17:52.534 --> 01:17:54.269
SAN FRANCISCO, SAN MATEO, SANTA

01:17:54.336 --> 01:18:00.308
CLARA, AND AND MUNI WILL HAVE

01:18:00.375 --> 01:18:01.543
THREE COUNTIES. BART WILL HAVE

01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:02.310
FOUR COUNTIES, ALL OF THEM

01:18:02.377 --> 01:18:04.713
EXCEPT FOR SANTA CLARA COUNTY.

01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:08.150
AND SAM. TRANS AND VTA WILL NOT

01:18:08.216 --> 01:18:10.185
HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY COMMITTEES,

01:18:10.252 --> 01:18:12.220
BUT THE OTHER OPERATORS WILL.

01:18:12.287 --> 01:18:13.455
AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS

01:18:13.522 --> 01:18:14.956
THOSE OPERATORS ARE REALLY

01:18:15.023 --> 01:18:17.359
WITHIN THEIR COUNTY. SO WE

01:18:17.426 --> 01:18:20.062
FOCUS MOST ON THE MULTI-COUNTY

01:18:20.128 --> 01:18:22.597
OPERATORS. AND WHAT WILL HAPPEN

01:18:22.664 --> 01:18:26.234
IS ANY COUNTY OF ANY COUNTY,

01:18:26.301 --> 01:18:27.436
TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY OR

01:18:27.502 --> 01:18:30.338
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS CAN LODGE

01:18:30.405 --> 01:18:33.108
A COMPLAINT THAT, YOU KNOW,

01:18:33.175 --> 01:18:35.377
BART IS NOT DOING THIS, OR MUNI

01:18:35.444 --> 01:18:37.646
IS NOT DOING THAT, AND IT WILL

01:18:37.712 --> 01:18:41.383
THEN GO TO THAT COMMITTEE AND

01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:44.352
THEY'LL GET SORT OF AN

01:18:44.419 --> 01:18:46.521
ADMONITION TO TRY TO A GRACE

01:18:46.588 --> 01:18:48.523
PERIOD TO FIX THE PROBLEM. IF

01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:50.459
THEY DON'T FIX IT, THEN THE THE

01:18:50.525 --> 01:18:52.260
BOARD FOR THAT OPERATOR WILL

01:18:52.327 --> 01:18:55.430
VOTE. IF IT'S A MAJORITY IN

01:18:55.497 --> 01:18:57.332
FAVOR OF WITHHOLDING FUNDS OR A

01:18:57.399 --> 01:19:01.403
TIE, THEN THEN UP TO 3.5% CAN

01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:03.705
BE WITHHELD FOR THE FIRST 90

01:19:03.772 --> 01:19:06.408
DAYS. IF A DAY 90, THE PROBLEM

01:19:06.475 --> 01:19:08.443
HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED, THE

01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:10.378
BOARD VOTES AGAIN, AND IF THEY

01:19:10.445 --> 01:19:13.281
VOTE IN FAVOR OR A TIE, THEN UP

01:19:13.348 --> 01:19:16.751
TO 7% IS WITHHELD. ONCE YOU HIT,

01:19:16.818 --> 01:19:19.254
THEN 180 DAYS, A MAJORITY VOTE

01:19:19.321 --> 01:19:21.323
OF THE BOARD CAN RELEASE THE

01:19:21.389 --> 01:19:22.290
FUNDS AND DETERMINE WHETHER THE

01:19:22.357 --> 01:19:24.292
PROBLEM HAS BEEN RESOLVED. IT

01:19:24.359 --> 01:19:29.798
IS A. IT'S, I THINK, A PRETTY

01:19:29.865 --> 01:19:33.235
TOUGH. TOUGH LOVE KIND OF

01:19:33.301 --> 01:19:34.503
ACCOUNTABILITY. IT'S NOT

01:19:34.569 --> 01:19:36.371
SOMETHING THAT I AM INHERENTLY

01:19:36.438 --> 01:19:38.807
COMFORTABLE WITH, BUT I THINK

01:19:38.874 --> 01:19:41.243
IT'S A REASONABLE APPROACH. AND

01:19:41.309 --> 01:19:42.477
SO THAT IS HOW THE

01:19:42.544 --> 01:19:44.379
ACCOUNTABILITY AND THAT THAT'S,

01:19:44.446 --> 01:19:46.414
TO MY KNOWLEDGE, UNPRECEDENTED

01:19:46.481 --> 01:19:48.817
IN ADDITION TO THE MTC, HAS

01:19:48.884 --> 01:19:50.585
BROAD AUTHORITY. IF AN OPERATOR

01:19:50.652 --> 01:19:52.354
IS NOT COMPLYING WITH THE LAW

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:54.256
TO TO DECLINE TO PROVIDE FUNDS

01:19:54.322 --> 01:19:55.557
UNTIL THE PROBLEM'S RESOLVED,

01:19:55.624 --> 01:19:57.459
THAT'S LIKE AN INHERENT BROAD

01:19:57.526 --> 01:19:58.226
AUTHORITY. BUT THEN THERE'S THE

01:19:58.293 --> 01:19:59.294
SPECIFIC IN TERMS OF THIS

01:19:59.361 --> 01:20:00.662
STRUCTURE, THE CHAIR'S PROPOSED,

01:20:00.729 --> 01:20:03.265
AND I'VE ACCEPTED. I HAVE NEVER

01:20:03.331 --> 01:20:04.966
HEARD OF ANY ACCOUNTABILITY

01:20:05.033 --> 01:20:07.435
PROVISION FOR TRANSIT. OPERATOR.

01:20:07.502 --> 01:20:09.237
THE STRONG MAYBE IT EXISTS

01:20:09.304 --> 01:20:10.405
SOMEWHERE. I'VE NEVER HEARD OF

01:20:10.472 --> 01:20:13.108
IT. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER

01:20:13.175 --> 01:20:17.179
LACKEY. YEAH, I'M SORRY THAT I

01:20:17.245 --> 01:20:19.614
DON'T JUST SEE THIS AS A RESCUE

01:20:19.681 --> 01:20:21.183
PLAN, UNFORTUNATELY. INSTEAD,

01:20:21.249 --> 01:20:23.318
IT SEEMS TO BE A TAXPAYER

01:20:23.385 --> 01:20:26.087
BAILOUT FOR SYSTEMS THAT REFUSE

01:20:26.154 --> 01:20:28.657
TO REFORM. TRANSIT AGENCIES ARE

01:20:28.723 --> 01:20:29.624
ASKING FOR MORE MONEY WHILE

01:20:29.691 --> 01:20:31.359
DOING NOTHING. AT LEAST IT

01:20:31.426 --> 01:20:33.795
DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE TO CUT

01:20:33.862 --> 01:20:35.163
THEIR EXPENSES, IMPROVE SERVICE,

01:20:35.230 --> 01:20:37.365
OR EARN BACK PUBLIC TRUST.

01:20:37.432 --> 01:20:39.768
BUDGETS ARE UP, BUT RIDERSHIP

01:20:39.834 --> 01:20:41.403
IS DOWN AND THERE APPEARS TO BE

01:20:41.469 --> 01:20:44.272
LITTLE OVERSIGHT, NO REAL HARD

01:20:44.339 --> 01:20:46.474
CHOICES ON THEIR PART. AND NOW

01:20:46.541 --> 01:20:48.143
WE'RE TRYING TO PUSH A

01:20:48.210 --> 01:20:50.412
REGRESSIVE TAX UNDER THE BALLOT

01:20:50.478 --> 01:20:52.113
BY DODGING THE TWO THIRDS VOTE

01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:53.782
OF THE PEOPLE, WHICH USUALLY

01:20:53.848 --> 01:20:56.751
THE LAW REQUIRES WORKING

01:20:56.818 --> 01:20:58.220
FAMILIES, UNFORTUNATELY,

01:20:58.286 --> 01:21:00.522
APPEARS LIKE THEY'LL BE PAYING

01:21:00.589 --> 01:21:02.190
MORE, WHILE LOCAL PRIORITIES

01:21:02.257 --> 01:21:03.391
LIKE PUBLIC SAFETY AND CHILD

01:21:03.458 --> 01:21:06.261
CARE GET PUSHED ASIDE. THIS

01:21:06.328 --> 01:21:08.597
ISN'T ABOUT JUST KEEPING TRAINS

01:21:08.663 --> 01:21:10.432
RUNNING, IT'S ABOUT KEEPING A

01:21:10.498 --> 01:21:13.401
BROKEN BUREAUCRACY FUNDING NO

01:21:13.468 --> 01:21:15.203
MATTER WHAT THE COST. AND SO I

01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:17.405
FIND IT AN UNFORTUNATE REMEDY.

01:21:17.472 --> 01:21:18.673
AND I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WORKING

01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:20.342
HARD, AND I KNOW I DON'T DOUBT

01:21:20.408 --> 01:21:22.577
THAT YOU'RE VERY SINCERE ABOUT

01:21:22.644 --> 01:21:25.180
THE URGENCY AND THE DIFFICULT

01:21:25.247 --> 01:21:26.481
CIRCUMSTANCE. I, I'M VERY

01:21:26.548 --> 01:21:28.683
SYMPATHETIC TO TRANSPORTATION

01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:30.352
AND KNOW HOW PUBLIC

01:21:30.418 --> 01:21:32.387
TRANSPORTATION IS CRITICAL,

01:21:32.454 --> 01:21:34.256
ESPECIALLY IN THE BAY AREA. BUT

01:21:34.322 --> 01:21:36.324
THIS SEEMS TO BE THE WRONG

01:21:36.391 --> 01:21:38.460
APPROACH TO ME. AND THAT'S ALL

01:21:38.526 --> 01:21:42.097
I GOT. THANK YOU, ASSEMBLY

01:21:42.163 --> 01:21:45.634
MEMBER PAPIN. THANK YOU SO MUCH,

01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:47.736
MADAM CHAIR. SO, AS YOU CAN

01:21:47.802 --> 01:21:49.304
WELL IMAGINE, DON'T HAVE MUCH

01:21:49.371 --> 01:21:50.639
OF A QUESTION, BUT RATHER I DO

01:21:50.705 --> 01:21:52.274
HAVE A STATEMENT ABOUT THE BILL

01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:54.476
NOW AND HOW MY COUNTY IS STILL

01:21:54.542 --> 01:21:57.312
NOT ACCOUNTED FOR. SO I WANT TO

01:21:57.379 --> 01:21:58.613
START WITH TRANSIT'S BROKEN

01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:00.448
RECORD. THESE TRANSIT AGENCIES

01:22:00.515 --> 01:22:02.484
ARE ASKING US TO SAVE THEM, BUT

01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:05.186
THEY CAN'T SAVE THEMSELVES. BAY

01:22:05.253 --> 01:22:06.488
AREA TRANSIT OPERATORS HAVE

01:22:06.554 --> 01:22:07.922
BEEN FAILING TO MANAGE

01:22:07.989 --> 01:22:08.456
THEMSELVES ADEQUATELY, AS

01:22:08.523 --> 01:22:10.225
EVIDENCED BY, MOST RECENTLY,

01:22:10.292 --> 01:22:12.427
THE BART FAREGATE ISSUE. FOR

01:22:12.494 --> 01:22:14.562
YEARS, BART WAS LOSING UPWARDS

01:22:14.629 --> 01:22:18.166
OF $30 MILLION A YEAR IN FARE

01:22:18.233 --> 01:22:20.735
EVASIONS, YET THEY REFUSE TO

01:22:20.802 --> 01:22:21.603
UPGRADE THE FARE GATES UNTIL

01:22:21.670 --> 01:22:24.205
THEY WERE REALLY PUSHED TO IT.

01:22:24.272 --> 01:22:25.874
AND THEN, OF COURSE, THEY SAID

01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:27.575
TO MY COUNTY, WELL, YOU GO FIND

01:22:27.642 --> 01:22:28.476
THE 10 MILLION TO UPGRADE THE

01:22:28.543 --> 01:22:30.378
FARE GATES. THE MISMANAGEMENT

01:22:30.445 --> 01:22:31.613
EXTENDS TO THE MOST BASIC OF

01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:32.747
RIDERSHIP NEEDS, SUCH AS

01:22:32.814 --> 01:22:34.316
WORKING ESCALATORS, OPERATIONAL

01:22:34.382 --> 01:22:36.117
BATHROOMS AND SAFE STATIONS.

01:22:36.184 --> 01:22:37.385
AND THAT SAYS NOTHING ABOUT

01:22:37.452 --> 01:22:39.554
THEIR JOB. AS TRANSIT MANAGERS.

01:22:39.621 --> 01:22:41.623
THEY HAVE CONTINUED TO FAIL IN

01:22:41.690 --> 01:22:43.625
MAKING CONNECTIVITY EASY AND

01:22:43.692 --> 01:22:45.093
EFFECTIVE FOR THE RIDERS. WITH

01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:47.462
THE PROPOSED VERSION OF SB Ó

01:22:47.529 --> 01:22:50.298
AND ALL ALONG MTC, WHICH IS

01:22:50.365 --> 01:22:51.199
CALLED THE METROPOLITAN

01:22:51.266 --> 01:22:52.334
TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, HAS

01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:55.470
GIVEN THEM THE LICENSE TO ACT

01:22:55.537 --> 01:22:56.638
WITHOUT ACCOUNTABILITY. WITH

01:22:56.705 --> 01:22:59.174
THE PROPOSED VERSION OF SB 63,

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:00.809
TAXPAYERS ARE NOW BEING ASKED

01:23:00.875 --> 01:23:02.377
TO BAIL OUT THOSE SAME

01:23:02.444 --> 01:23:04.245
OPERATORS WITH NO POWER TO

01:23:04.312 --> 01:23:06.915
REGULARLY MONITOR OR ENFORCE

01:23:06.981 --> 01:23:08.283
PERFORMANCE. I THINK THIS IS A

01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:10.418
MISSED OPPORTUNITY FOR REAL AND

01:23:10.485 --> 01:23:12.187
FAIR OVERSIGHT, SO THAT NOT

01:23:12.253 --> 01:23:13.521
ONLY ARE WE PROVIDING MONEY AND

01:23:13.588 --> 01:23:15.357
A BAILOUT TO THE TRANSIT

01:23:15.423 --> 01:23:17.125
AGENCIES, BUT WE'RE ALSO ASKING

01:23:17.192 --> 01:23:19.461
FOR ECONOMIC STABILITY. I DON'T

01:23:19.527 --> 01:23:21.096
BELIEVE THAT MONEY FOR A

01:23:21.162 --> 01:23:23.264
BAILOUT AND ACCOUNTABILITY ARE

01:23:23.331 --> 01:23:25.166
MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE, NOT BY ANY

01:23:25.233 --> 01:23:26.434
STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION.

01:23:26.501 --> 01:23:28.603
WITHOUT REAL ACCOUNTABILITY,

01:23:28.670 --> 01:23:30.105
PROBLEMS ARE GOING TO PERSIST.

01:23:30.171 --> 01:23:32.874
SO SAN MATEO COUNTY TAXPAYERS

01:23:32.941 --> 01:23:34.042
TO CONTRIBUTE BILLIONS. THAT'S

01:23:34.109 --> 01:23:36.878
WITH A B FOLKS IN NEW SALES TAX

01:23:36.945 --> 01:23:38.847
REVENUE. YET GOVERNANCE RESTS

01:23:38.913 --> 01:23:41.249
WITH MTC'S NINE COUNTY BOARD.

01:23:41.316 --> 01:23:43.852
FIVE COUNTIES ARE BEING TAXED.

01:23:43.918 --> 01:23:45.787
NINE COUNTIES ARE CALLING THE

01:23:45.854 --> 01:23:47.389
SHOTS. THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY

01:23:47.455 --> 01:23:49.324
UNDEMOCRATIC. THAT IS NOT

01:23:49.391 --> 01:23:52.127
TAXATION WITH FAIR AND FULL

01:23:52.193 --> 01:23:53.695
REPRESENTATION BY THOSE

01:23:53.762 --> 01:23:56.398
ACTUALLY BEING TAXED. I

01:23:56.464 --> 01:23:58.600
PROPOSED A TEN MEMBER BOARD

01:23:58.666 --> 01:24:00.402
ACCOUNTABLE TO THE VOTERS WHO

01:24:00.468 --> 01:24:02.337
ARE PAYING THE BILL. THE BOARD

01:24:02.404 --> 01:24:04.406
WOULD CONDUCT ANNUAL REVIEWS IN

01:24:04.472 --> 01:24:06.007
ADDITION TO A LOCAL PETITION

01:24:06.074 --> 01:24:07.342
PROCESS, AND RETAIN THE RIGHT

01:24:07.409 --> 01:24:09.444
TO WITHHOLD UP TO 15% OF

01:24:09.511 --> 01:24:11.746
FUNDING FOR UP TO 180 DAYS IF

01:24:11.813 --> 01:24:13.982
OPERATORS FAIL TO MEET

01:24:14.048 --> 01:24:15.483
PERFORMANCE METRICS. THAT'S NOT

01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:17.318
DRACONIAN. THAT'S BASIC

01:24:17.385 --> 01:24:18.486
ACCOUNTABILITY. SIMPLY

01:24:18.553 --> 01:24:20.288
REQUIRING OPERATORS TO DELIVER

01:24:20.355 --> 01:24:22.390
THE SERVICE TAXPAYERS ARE

01:24:22.457 --> 01:24:24.159
PAYING FOR. UNDER THE PROPOSED

01:24:24.225 --> 01:24:26.327
VERSION OF THE BILL, WHICH WAS

01:24:26.394 --> 01:24:28.229
AMENDED LATE IN THE GAME, EACH

01:24:28.296 --> 01:24:29.330
COUNTY CAN PETITION A GRIEVANCE

01:24:29.397 --> 01:24:33.201
ONCE A YEAR THAT IS REACTIVE,

01:24:33.268 --> 01:24:34.302
NOT PROACTIVE MANAGEMENT. THESE

01:24:34.369 --> 01:24:36.438
LAST MINUTE AMENDMENTS PRESERVE

01:24:36.504 --> 01:24:38.873
A FIEFDOM, PERPETUATING THE

01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:40.442
INEFFECTIVENESS WE'VE HAD ALL

01:24:40.508 --> 01:24:42.310
ALONG. I'VE SPOKEN WITH

01:24:42.377 --> 01:24:44.979
COMMISSIONERS ON ON MTC WHO

01:24:45.046 --> 01:24:46.247
HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO OBJECTION TO

01:24:46.314 --> 01:24:48.216
A TEN MEMBER GOVERNING BOARD.

01:24:48.283 --> 01:24:49.984
YET MTC STAFF WAS THROUGHOUT

01:24:50.051 --> 01:24:51.386
THIS BUILDING FIGHTING FOR SUCH

01:24:51.453 --> 01:24:53.688
FIGHTING AGAINST SUCH A

01:24:53.755 --> 01:24:56.724
STRUCTURE. I WANT TO TURN NOW

01:24:56.791 --> 01:24:59.127
TO SOME OF THE ALLOCATION

01:24:59.194 --> 01:25:00.662
PARTICULARS. MY COUNTY WAS

01:25:00.728 --> 01:25:03.798
ASKED TO PAY ON BEHALF OF SAN

01:25:03.865 --> 01:25:05.700
FRANCISCO MUNI, A GOOD PORTION

01:25:05.767 --> 01:25:07.469
OF THEIR PAYMENT TO CALTRAIN

01:25:07.535 --> 01:25:08.736
THAT JUST SAT HERE AND

01:25:08.803 --> 01:25:11.372
TESTIFIED. THE RESULT IS MY

01:25:11.439 --> 01:25:13.274
COUNTY WILL FRONT $56 MILLION

01:25:13.341 --> 01:25:15.543
OF MUNI'S CONTRIBUTION TO

01:25:15.610 --> 01:25:17.512
CALTRAIN. SO MY COUNTY SAID,

01:25:17.579 --> 01:25:19.347
HEY, WE'RE ALSO GOING TO

01:25:19.414 --> 01:25:21.416
SUPPORT MUNI. CAN WE HAVE A

01:25:21.483 --> 01:25:22.350
HAIRCUT ON WHEN WE'RE GIVING

01:25:22.417 --> 01:25:24.085
MUNI BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO

01:25:24.152 --> 01:25:26.387
FRONT THE MONEY TO CALTRAIN?

01:25:26.454 --> 01:25:29.491
THEY WERE TOLD NO. SAN MATEO IS

01:25:29.557 --> 01:25:30.758
THE ECONOMIC ENGINE OF

01:25:30.825 --> 01:25:32.160
CALIFORNIA. IF MY COUNTY IS

01:25:32.227 --> 01:25:34.329
FORCED TO ACCEPT THIS BAD DEAL,

01:25:34.395 --> 01:25:35.196
THE CONSEQUENCES EXTEND FAR

01:25:35.263 --> 01:25:37.332
BEYOND OUR BORDERS. A BAD DEAL

01:25:37.398 --> 01:25:39.167
FOR SAN MATEO IS A BAD DEAL FOR

01:25:39.234 --> 01:25:41.202
THE ENTIRE STATE. NOW, AS WE GO

01:25:41.269 --> 01:25:44.072
FORWARD, GIVEN HOW MUCH THE

01:25:44.138 --> 01:25:45.540
BILL HAS CHANGED, THERE WERE

01:25:45.607 --> 01:25:46.441
VOTES IN MY COUNTY. THEY NEVER

01:25:46.508 --> 01:25:49.143
SAW THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT

01:25:49.210 --> 01:25:50.211
FORM LIKE THIS. SO GIVEN HOW

01:25:50.278 --> 01:25:51.446
MUCH THE BILL HAS CHANGED AND

01:25:51.513 --> 01:25:53.047
HOW DIFFERENT THIS LANGUAGE IS

01:25:53.114 --> 01:25:54.082
FROM THE NEGOTIATIONS THAT WERE

01:25:54.148 --> 01:25:56.384
TAKING PLACE EVEN A WEEK AGO, I

01:25:56.451 --> 01:25:58.319
WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST THAT THE

01:25:58.386 --> 01:25:59.254
BILL BE AMENDED TO INCLUDE AN

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:01.789
OPPORTUNITY FOR AN OPT OUT, FOR

01:26:01.856 --> 01:26:05.360
AN OPT OUT COUNTY TO OPT OUT IN

01:26:05.426 --> 01:26:06.628
JANUARY. WE CAN HAVE ALTERNATE

01:26:06.694 --> 01:26:08.129
LANGUAGE THAT SAYS IF A COUNTY

01:26:08.196 --> 01:26:09.831
OPTS OUT, HERE'S HOW THE BILL

01:26:09.898 --> 01:26:11.099
SHOULD READ, AND IT'S TRIGGERED

01:26:11.165 --> 01:26:14.302
IF A COUNTY SHOULD OPT OUT. MY

01:26:14.369 --> 01:26:16.804
COUNTY DIDN'T SEE THIS BILL.

01:26:16.871 --> 01:26:18.540
SAN MATEO COUNTY IS REALLY

01:26:18.606 --> 01:26:20.441
BEING ASKED TO WRITE A BLANK

01:26:20.508 --> 01:26:22.877
CHECK. AGAIN, THIS IS TAXATION

01:26:22.944 --> 01:26:24.345
WITHOUT FAIR REPRESENTATION BY

01:26:24.412 --> 01:26:28.383
THOSE BEING TAXED. THIS IS A

01:26:28.449 --> 01:26:29.517
SALES TAX. DURING A TIME WHEN

01:26:29.584 --> 01:26:31.219
WE ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON

01:26:31.286 --> 01:26:32.720
DELIVERING AFFORDABILITY TO OUR

01:26:32.787 --> 01:26:34.455
CONSTITUENTS, THE LEAST WE

01:26:34.522 --> 01:26:36.558
COULD DO IS PROVIDE IS PROVIDE

01:26:36.624 --> 01:26:38.426
THEM WITH PROACTIVE MATERIAL

01:26:38.493 --> 01:26:40.929
ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT.

01:26:40.995 --> 01:26:43.164
FOR THESE REASONS, I WILL BE

01:26:43.231 --> 01:26:46.334
CASTING A NO VOTE. THANK YOU,

01:26:46.401 --> 01:26:47.368
ASSEMBLYMEMBER PAPAN. BEFORE I

01:26:47.435 --> 01:26:50.672
GET A CHANCE TO TURN IT OVER TO

01:26:50.738 --> 01:26:52.473
RESPONSE, I WILL NOTE TWO

01:26:52.540 --> 01:26:54.375
THINGS ONE, I DIDN'T. I JUST

01:26:54.442 --> 01:26:56.411
WENT STRAIGHT FROM LACKEY TO

01:26:56.477 --> 01:26:57.478
HAPPEN WITHOUT GIVING YOU A

01:26:57.545 --> 01:26:59.180
CHANCE TO COMMENT. SO IF YOU'D

01:26:59.247 --> 01:27:00.415
LIKE TO COME, YOU CAN INCLUDE

01:27:00.481 --> 01:27:02.483
THAT IN THERE. I JUST WANTED TO

01:27:02.550 --> 01:27:03.284
NOTE MY APOLOGIES FOR NOT

01:27:03.351 --> 01:27:04.552
GIVING AN OPPORTUNITY TO FOR

01:27:04.619 --> 01:27:06.788
BOTH YOU ALL TO HAVE A

01:27:06.854 --> 01:27:07.655
DISCOURSE ON THAT. SECONDLY,

01:27:07.722 --> 01:27:09.357
THE BILL IS HEAVILY NEGOTIATED.

01:27:09.424 --> 01:27:11.192
WE DON'T NEGOTIATE FROM THE

01:27:11.259 --> 01:27:12.293
DÍAS, AND WE WERE NEGOTIATING

01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:15.363
THIS BILL ALL THE WAY UP UNTIL

01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:17.131
SATURDAY. I'M SORRY, LAST NIGHT

01:27:17.198 --> 01:27:20.435
AT 10 P.M. TO FIGURE THIS OUT.

01:27:20.501 --> 01:27:22.670
AND SO JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT

01:27:22.737 --> 01:27:24.606
FOR THE RECORD, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:27:24.672 --> 01:27:26.207
I'M SORRY, SENATOR WIENER

01:27:26.274 --> 01:27:28.509
RESPONSE AND OF COURSE, SENATOR

01:27:28.576 --> 01:27:29.744
IRVINE, YOU ARE JOINT AUTHOR.

01:27:29.811 --> 01:27:31.446
YOU CAN ALSO PROVIDE COMMENTS

01:27:31.512 --> 01:27:33.381
ON ANYTHING THAT'S STATED TODAY.

01:27:33.448 --> 01:27:34.616
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MADAM

01:27:34.682 --> 01:27:37.885
CHAIR. AND I FIRST OF ALL, I

01:27:37.952 --> 01:27:40.154
WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:27:40.221 --> 01:27:41.689
PAPPIN, MY NEIGHBOR TO THE

01:27:41.756 --> 01:27:44.626
SOUTH. WE, SHE AND I HAVE HAD

01:27:44.692 --> 01:27:45.593
SIGNIFICANT ENGAGEMENT ON THIS

01:27:45.660 --> 01:27:48.162
BILL. WE'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME

01:27:48.229 --> 01:27:49.197
TOGETHER, PARTICULARLY ON THE

01:27:49.263 --> 01:27:52.433
PHONE, IN RECENT WEEKS, TO TRY

01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:57.405
TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT. AND WE

01:27:57.472 --> 01:28:00.308
DID NOT COME TO AN AGREEMENT.

01:28:00.375 --> 01:28:02.777
WE BOTH TRIED IN GOOD FAITH TO

01:28:02.844 --> 01:28:05.880
DO IT, AND WE AND I KNOW I WANT

01:28:05.947 --> 01:28:07.548
TO AND I'VE EXPRESSED THIS TO

01:28:07.615 --> 01:28:09.684
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THERE WERE

01:28:09.751 --> 01:28:10.652
SOME SIGNIFICANT THINGS THAT

01:28:10.718 --> 01:28:12.253
SHE ASKED FOR THAT I WAS

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:13.821
WILLING TO AGREE TO, LIKE

01:28:13.888 --> 01:28:16.591
CREATING AN ENTIRELY NEW AGENCY

01:28:16.658 --> 01:28:17.692
TO ADMINISTER THIS. WE GET

01:28:17.759 --> 01:28:19.527
CRITICIZED A LOT IN THE BAY

01:28:19.594 --> 01:28:21.963
AREA THAT WE HAVE, I THINK 27

01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:23.531
OR 28 TRANSIT AGENCIES. WE GET

01:28:23.598 --> 01:28:25.333
CRITICIZED HARSHLY FOR THAT

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:26.434
BECAUSE IT MEANS MORE

01:28:26.501 --> 01:28:28.436
ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD. THE

01:28:28.503 --> 01:28:30.371
ASSEMBLY MEMBER WANTED THIS TO

01:28:30.438 --> 01:28:32.173
BE A SEPARATE AGENCY FROM THE

01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:36.511
MTC, A NEW AGENCY, AND A LOT OF

01:28:36.577 --> 01:28:37.845
PEOPLE HAD PROBLEMS WITH THAT.

01:28:37.912 --> 01:28:41.282
I AGREED TO IT AND I CONVINCED

01:28:41.349 --> 01:28:44.285
SOME OTHER PEOPLE TO ACCEPT IT,

01:28:44.352 --> 01:28:46.821
BUT THERE WERE ASPECTS TO WHAT

01:28:46.888 --> 01:28:48.356
ASSEMBLYMEMBER ASKED FOR THAT

01:28:48.423 --> 01:28:50.291
WENT BEYOND WHAT WE COULD AGREE

01:28:50.358 --> 01:28:52.527
TO. AND I WISH WE COULD HAVE

01:28:52.593 --> 01:28:54.595
COME TO AN AGREEMENT. I VERY

01:28:54.662 --> 01:28:56.497
MUCH WANTED TO. I WANT US TO

01:28:56.564 --> 01:28:57.365
ALL BE LOCKING ARMS, AND WE

01:28:57.432 --> 01:28:59.233
SPENT A LOT OF TIME, I THINK,

01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:01.269
BECAUSE WE BOTH WANTED TO COME

01:29:01.335 --> 01:29:02.570
TO AN AGREEMENT IN GOOD FAITH,

01:29:02.637 --> 01:29:05.573
AND WE DIDN'T GET THERE. AS I

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:08.009
DESCRIBED AT THE BEGINNING,

01:29:08.076 --> 01:29:10.211
THIS BILL HAS THE STRONGEST

01:29:10.278 --> 01:29:12.346
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AGENCY

01:29:12.413 --> 01:29:14.182
ACCOUNTABILITY, HARSH

01:29:14.248 --> 01:29:15.316
ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES THAT I

01:29:15.383 --> 01:29:17.218
HAVE EVER SEEN. AND SO I CAN

01:29:17.285 --> 01:29:19.220
UNDERSTAND. I RESPECT ANY

01:29:19.287 --> 01:29:21.355
DESIRE TO HAVE DIFFERENT OR

01:29:21.422 --> 01:29:23.157
MORE, BUT TO SAY THAT THERE'S

01:29:23.224 --> 01:29:25.493
NO ACCOUNTABILITY IN HERE IS

01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:29.397
SIMPLY INACCURATE. YOU KNOW,

01:29:29.464 --> 01:29:32.200
SAN MATEO COUNTY OPTED IN. THEY

01:29:32.266 --> 01:29:33.868
OPTED IN TO THE EXPENDITURE

01:29:33.935 --> 01:29:36.237
PLAN THAT'S IN THE BILL. AFTER

01:29:36.304 --> 01:29:38.940
ALMOST A YEAR OF NEGOTIATION,

01:29:39.006 --> 01:29:41.209
THEY OPTED IN. MULTIPLE BODIES

01:29:41.275 --> 01:29:46.514
OPTED IN. AND YOU KNOW I ALSO I

01:29:46.581 --> 01:29:49.817
IT'S REALLY EASY TO TO

01:29:49.884 --> 01:29:51.486
CRITICIZE BART OR ANY OTHER

01:29:51.552 --> 01:29:55.156
SYSTEM. BART HAS STRUGGLED A

01:29:55.223 --> 01:29:56.624
LOT. WHEN YOU LOSE HALF YOUR

01:29:56.691 --> 01:29:58.459
RIDERSHIP, THEY'RE GOING TO

01:29:58.526 --> 01:30:00.962
HAVE SOME CHALLENGES. BART HAS

01:30:01.028 --> 01:30:03.064
MADE DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENTS IN

01:30:03.131 --> 01:30:05.733
THE LAST FEW YEARS, DRAMATIC

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:06.834
IMPROVEMENTS IN CLEANLINESS AND

01:30:06.901 --> 01:30:08.269
SAFETY, AND REPLACING THE FARE

01:30:08.336 --> 01:30:10.905
GATES SO THAT IT'S MUCH HARDER

01:30:10.972 --> 01:30:12.206
TO EVADE. YES, THERE WAS A

01:30:12.273 --> 01:30:13.674
SITUATION WITH SAN MATEO COUNTY,

01:30:13.741 --> 01:30:15.610
AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR, SAN

01:30:15.676 --> 01:30:17.578
MATEO COUNTY DOES NOT PAY THE

01:30:17.645 --> 01:30:19.781
3/8 OF A CENT SALES TAX THAT

01:30:19.847 --> 01:30:20.948
THE THREE COUNTIES PAY, DOES

01:30:21.015 --> 01:30:22.683
NOT PAY THE PROPERTY TAX THAT

01:30:22.750 --> 01:30:25.119
THE THREE BART COUNTIES PAY. SO

01:30:25.186 --> 01:30:25.553
SOMETIMES THERE ARE

01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:27.221
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT FINANCIAL

01:30:27.288 --> 01:30:28.623
RESPONSIBILITY. MY CONSTITUENTS

01:30:28.689 --> 01:30:30.458
PAY SALES TAX AND PROPERTY TAX

01:30:30.525 --> 01:30:32.593
INTO BART. SAN MATEO COUNTY

01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:34.095
DOES NOT BECAUSE OF A CHOICE

01:30:34.162 --> 01:30:36.297
THE COUNTY MADE 60 YEARS AGO. I

01:30:36.364 --> 01:30:37.899
WISH THEY HAD MADE A DIFFERENT

01:30:37.965 --> 01:30:39.233
CHOICE, BUT WE DO THE BEST THAT

01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:41.302
WE CAN UNDER THOSE

01:30:41.369 --> 01:30:42.503
CIRCUMSTANCES, AND I KNOW THAT

01:30:42.570 --> 01:30:43.304
THERE HAVE BEEN LEGITIMATE

01:30:43.371 --> 01:30:45.439
CONCERNS IN SAN MATEO COUNTY

01:30:45.506 --> 01:30:47.008
ABOUT BART AND THE RELATIONSHIP,

01:30:47.074 --> 01:30:49.277
AND WE HAVE WORKED HARD TO TRY

01:30:49.343 --> 01:30:50.611
TO CHANGE THAT RELATIONSHIP.

01:30:50.678 --> 01:30:52.246
AND THERE WILL BE

01:30:52.313 --> 01:30:54.315
ACCOUNTABILITY UNDER THIS BILL.

01:30:54.382 --> 01:30:56.551
AND IN TERMS OF, QUOTE, LAST

01:30:56.617 --> 01:30:58.286
MINUTE AMENDMENTS, THIS BILL

01:30:58.352 --> 01:31:00.588
HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY TRANSPARENT,

01:31:00.655 --> 01:31:02.590
AND WE HAVE ALL BEEN IN

01:31:02.657 --> 01:31:03.291
CONVERSATION WITH EACH OTHER.

01:31:03.357 --> 01:31:05.526
THE CHAIR CAME IN AFTER MISS

01:31:05.593 --> 01:31:06.694
PAPAN AND I COULD NOT REACH

01:31:06.761 --> 01:31:07.428
AGREEMENT AND PROPOSED

01:31:07.495 --> 01:31:09.463
AMENDMENTS. AND THEY ARE IN THE

01:31:09.530 --> 01:31:10.431
ANALYSIS TODAY AND THEY'RE VERY

01:31:10.498 --> 01:31:13.401
REASONABLE. AND SO I AND THE

01:31:13.467 --> 01:31:14.402
FINAL THING I WANT TO SAY ABOUT

01:31:14.468 --> 01:31:16.404
SAN MATEO COUNTY, 3 MILLION

01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:18.906
PEOPLE A YEAR BOARD BART IN SAN

01:31:18.973 --> 01:31:20.241
MATEO COUNTY, 2 MILLION PEOPLE

01:31:20.308 --> 01:31:23.010
A YEAR BOARD MUNI IN SAN MATEO

01:31:23.077 --> 01:31:25.680
COUNTY. THIS IS ALL A REGION

01:31:25.746 --> 01:31:26.647
THAT'S INTERCONNECTED. AND

01:31:26.714 --> 01:31:28.583
THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS SO

01:31:28.649 --> 01:31:30.952
IMPORTANT. MADAM CHAIR, THANK

01:31:31.018 --> 01:31:35.690
YOU TO BE HEARD. OKAY. GO AHEAD.

01:31:35.756 --> 01:31:38.259
I THINK BART WILL REMIND SAN

01:31:38.326 --> 01:31:40.394
MATEO COUNTY EVERY CHANCE IT

01:31:40.461 --> 01:31:43.231
GETS THAT YOU ARE NOT EQUAL.

01:31:43.297 --> 01:31:45.800
AND THEY DO SO, AND THEY TREAT

01:31:45.867 --> 01:31:46.634
THEM AS UNEQUAL. THAT'S THE

01:31:46.701 --> 01:31:50.538
REALITY HERE. AND I THINK WHAT

01:31:50.605 --> 01:31:52.406
WAS MISSED IN THE REMARKS IS

01:31:52.473 --> 01:31:54.842
THAT NO ONE IS SAYING THERE

01:31:54.909 --> 01:31:57.245
ISN'T ACCOUNTABILITY. THE

01:31:57.311 --> 01:32:00.114
REMARKS WERE THERE IS NOT REAL

01:32:00.181 --> 01:32:02.316
OR FAIR ACCOUNTABILITY FOR

01:32:02.383 --> 01:32:04.252
THOSE THAT ARE BEING TAXED AND

01:32:04.318 --> 01:32:07.421
TO BE LUMPED IN WITH FOUR OTHER

01:32:07.488 --> 01:32:10.324
COUNTIES WHO HAVE NO INVESTMENT

01:32:10.391 --> 01:32:13.127
IN THE TAX DOLLARS BEING RAISED.

01:32:13.194 --> 01:32:14.295
BY YOUR RIGHT, A VERY

01:32:14.362 --> 01:32:18.165
REGRESSIVE TAX IS NOT WHAT I

01:32:18.232 --> 01:32:20.635
CALL FAIR TAXATION WITH

01:32:20.701 --> 01:32:22.103
REPRESENTATION. AND I'LL JUST

01:32:22.169 --> 01:32:23.304
NOTE, BECAUSE THERE'S REFERENCE

01:32:23.371 --> 01:32:29.343
TO OUR OFFICE WORKING ON THE.

01:32:29.410 --> 01:32:31.145
ACCOUNTABILITY, WHAT IS NOW THE

01:32:31.212 --> 01:32:33.247
ACCOUNTABILITY. ADDITIONAL

01:32:33.314 --> 01:32:34.882
ACCOUNTABILITY WITHIN THE BILL

01:32:34.949 --> 01:32:38.486
IS THAT THE MTC BOARD IS

01:32:38.552 --> 01:32:40.154
SOMEWHAT OF A CLEARINGHOUSE FOR

01:32:40.221 --> 01:32:41.455
THIS RESOURCES. AS WAS NOTED,

01:32:41.522 --> 01:32:43.391
IT WAS HEAVILY NEGOTIATED. THE

01:32:43.457 --> 01:32:45.226
EXPENDITURE PLAN AND THE MTC

01:32:45.293 --> 01:32:48.396
BOARD HAS NO SAY ON THE

01:32:48.462 --> 01:32:50.331
ADJUDICATION COMMITTEE. IT IS

01:32:50.398 --> 01:32:52.366
ACCEPTED. SO THE PEOPLE

01:32:52.433 --> 01:32:53.334
INVOLVED AND ENGAGED WHO ARE

01:32:53.401 --> 01:32:55.403
IMPACTED ARE THE ONES WHO MAKE

01:32:55.469 --> 01:32:57.405
THE DECISION. THE MTC BOARD

01:32:57.471 --> 01:32:59.173
DOES NOT HAVE A SAY TO NOT

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:01.976
ACCEPT OR TO REJECT. THEY

01:33:02.043 --> 01:33:03.177
CANNOT REJECT WHAT THE

01:33:03.244 --> 01:33:05.646
ADJUDICATION COMMITTEE SAYS. SO

01:33:05.713 --> 01:33:07.448
THERE ARE YES, THERE ARE FOUR

01:33:07.515 --> 01:33:09.650
COUNTIES THAT ARE ON MTC THAT

01:33:09.717 --> 01:33:10.618
ARE NOT TAXED. THEY DON'T HAVE

01:33:10.685 --> 01:33:13.287
A SAY IN THIS, NOR DOES THE

01:33:13.354 --> 01:33:15.656
COUNTY HAVE A SAY IF THEY ARE

01:33:15.723 --> 01:33:17.258
NOT CONTRIBUTING TO THAT

01:33:17.325 --> 01:33:19.994
PARTICULAR BOARD. I'LL GO TO

01:33:20.061 --> 01:33:24.432
ASSEMBLY MEMBER AARONS. THANK

01:33:24.498 --> 01:33:26.534
YOU, MADAM CHAIR. I WANT TO

01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:27.535
THANK THE SENATORS FOR

01:33:27.601 --> 01:33:29.704
PRESENTING. I WANT TO

01:33:29.770 --> 01:33:31.238
ACKNOWLEDGE SOMETIMES THE

01:33:31.305 --> 01:33:33.407
FRUSTRATION OF THE LAST MINUTE

01:33:33.474 --> 01:33:34.475
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND THE

01:33:34.542 --> 01:33:37.712
FRUSTRATION WHERE WE ARE AND

01:33:37.778 --> 01:33:40.548
AND REALLY JUST TRYING TO FIND

01:33:40.614 --> 01:33:43.617
A SOLUTION TO A VERY DIFFICULT

01:33:43.684 --> 01:33:45.519
PROBLEM WHEN IT COMES TO OUR

01:33:45.586 --> 01:33:48.155
BAY AREA TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM.

01:33:48.222 --> 01:33:50.424
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HOW WE CAN

01:33:50.491 --> 01:33:52.293
CONTINUE TO IMPROVE. A LOT OF

01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:54.328
THE ISSUES THAT WERE BROUGHT UP

01:33:54.395 --> 01:33:55.529
TO MY COLLEAGUES AND WANT TO

01:33:55.596 --> 01:33:57.531
REMAIN COMMITTED AS A MEMBER OF

01:33:57.598 --> 01:33:58.632
THE TRANSPORTATION TO DO THAT.

01:33:58.699 --> 01:34:00.468
HOWEVER, WITH THAT BEING SAID,

01:34:00.534 --> 01:34:02.570
I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL

01:34:02.636 --> 01:34:05.106
TODAY. MOTION MADE SECOND,

01:34:05.172 --> 01:34:06.340
SECONDED BY. SO WE HAVE A

01:34:06.407 --> 01:34:08.242
MOTION ON THE FLOOR BY AARONS

01:34:08.309 --> 01:34:10.244
AND A SECOND BY HER. AND JUST

01:34:10.311 --> 01:34:11.612
NOTING THAT OUR COMMITTEE

01:34:11.679 --> 01:34:13.414
AMENDMENTS THAT ARE BEYOND THE

01:34:13.481 --> 01:34:14.648
AUTHOR'S AMENDMENT. SO IS THAT

01:34:14.715 --> 01:34:16.250
WITH THE NOTE OF THE COMMITTEE

01:34:16.317 --> 01:34:17.485
AMENDMENTS AND THEN NOTING ON

01:34:17.551 --> 01:34:20.321
THE JUST TO BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR

01:34:20.388 --> 01:34:21.489
ON THE AGENDA AND NOTES THE

01:34:21.555 --> 01:34:23.090
URGENCY BECAUSE THERE WAS AN

01:34:23.157 --> 01:34:25.659
URGENCY BROUGHT FORTH OUT OF

01:34:25.726 --> 01:34:26.260
APPROPRIATIONS. THE COMMITTEE

01:34:26.327 --> 01:34:27.561
AMENDMENTS DO REMOVE THAT

01:34:27.628 --> 01:34:29.397
URGENCY. SO IT INCLUDES ALL OF

01:34:29.463 --> 01:34:31.499
THE STRICKEN OUT LANGUAGE, PLUS

01:34:31.565 --> 01:34:32.366
THE REMOVAL OF OF THE URGENCY.

01:34:32.433 --> 01:34:34.402
AND SO JUST MAKING SURE MY

01:34:34.468 --> 01:34:35.936
MOTION AND SECOND ARE CLEAR ON

01:34:36.003 --> 01:34:37.838
THAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU,

01:34:37.905 --> 01:34:40.374
MADAM CHAIR, HOLD ONE SECOND.

01:34:40.441 --> 01:34:43.344
WE DO HAVE AN ORDER. AND SO I

01:34:43.411 --> 01:34:45.479
CAN ADD YOU BACK IN THE QUEUE,

01:34:45.546 --> 01:34:47.014
WHICH WE NORMALLY DON'T DO, BUT

01:34:47.081 --> 01:34:48.516
I CAN ADD YOU BACK IN THE QUEUE.

01:34:48.582 --> 01:34:51.585
OKAY. WERE YOU DID YOU WANT TO

01:34:51.652 --> 01:34:53.320
RESPOND IN ANY WAY TO THAT? AS

01:34:53.387 --> 01:34:55.156
I KEEP WANT TO MAKE YOU

01:34:55.222 --> 01:34:56.323
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. MY APOLOGIES

01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:58.526
FOR TRYING TO HONOR YOU. YOU

01:34:58.592 --> 01:35:00.294
ARE ON THE GREEN CARPET A LOT,

01:35:00.361 --> 01:35:04.031
I WILL SAY. ALL RIGHT. ASSEMBLY

01:35:04.098 --> 01:35:05.299
MEMBER ROGERS. THANK YOU. CHAIR.

01:35:05.366 --> 01:35:07.468
SO I THINK ONE OF THE

01:35:07.535 --> 01:35:09.270
FRUSTRATIONS THAT I HEAR AND

01:35:09.336 --> 01:35:11.405
ONE OF THE FRUSTRATIONS THAT I

01:35:11.472 --> 01:35:13.774
FEEL REPRESENTING SOME OF THE

01:35:13.841 --> 01:35:15.309
COUNTIES THAT I REPRESENT, IS

01:35:15.376 --> 01:35:17.878
WHEN THERE IS HISTORY AND I

01:35:17.945 --> 01:35:19.213
DON'T KNOW ALL OF THE HISTORY

01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:21.415
IN A LOT OF THESE FIGHTS. AND

01:35:21.482 --> 01:35:22.650
OFTENTIMES THEY ARE FIGHTS TO

01:35:22.716 --> 01:35:24.385
MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS HAVE THE

01:35:24.452 --> 01:35:25.519
RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED TO

01:35:25.586 --> 01:35:26.754
DELIVER FOR THE COUNTIES THAT

01:35:26.821 --> 01:35:28.322
THEY REPRESENT, THAT THEY

01:35:28.389 --> 01:35:30.524
THERE'S VERY FEW TOUCH POINTS

01:35:30.591 --> 01:35:32.159
OR OPPORTUNITIES TO TRY TO

01:35:32.226 --> 01:35:33.427
CORRECT SOME OF WHAT HAS

01:35:33.494 --> 01:35:36.230
ALREADY GONE WRONG. AND I HEAR

01:35:36.297 --> 01:35:37.565
THE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE

01:35:37.631 --> 01:35:40.434
TWO OF YOU, SPECIFICALLY ABOUT

01:35:40.501 --> 01:35:43.471
THE COUNTY. AND WHAT I HEAR

01:35:43.537 --> 01:35:46.607
FROM YOU IS THAT THERE'S

01:35:46.674 --> 01:35:47.341
ACCOUNTABILITY, THAT THE

01:35:47.408 --> 01:35:48.442
DECISIONS WILL NOT BE MADE BY

01:35:48.509 --> 01:35:50.778
OTHER COUNTIES. I HEAR THE

01:35:50.845 --> 01:35:52.480
OPPOSITE FROM MY COLLEAGUE, AND

01:35:52.546 --> 01:35:54.615
I JUST WANT TO SUPPORT THAT.

01:35:54.682 --> 01:35:57.384
ALL OF US DON'T LIKE BEING IN

01:35:57.451 --> 01:35:58.352
THAT POSITION AND WANT TO FEEL

01:35:58.419 --> 01:36:00.387
SUPPORTED AND HEARD WHEN WE'RE

01:36:00.454 --> 01:36:01.589
OUTNUMBERED AND WHEN OUR

01:36:01.655 --> 01:36:03.424
COUNTIES FEEL OUTNUMBERED. SO

01:36:03.491 --> 01:36:06.360
MY QUESTION IS VERY SIMPLE,

01:36:06.427 --> 01:36:09.263
WHICH IS FOR SAN MATEO COUNTY,

01:36:09.330 --> 01:36:11.465
HOW ARE THEIR VOICES HEARD? HOW

01:36:11.532 --> 01:36:13.968
IS THEIR REPRESENTATION

01:36:14.034 --> 01:36:17.338
EXPRESSED? AND WHEN THEY FEEL

01:36:17.404 --> 01:36:20.474
AS THOUGH THEY ARE NOT BEING

01:36:20.541 --> 01:36:22.309
HEARD, WHAT IS THEIR ACTUAL

01:36:22.376 --> 01:36:25.479
ABILITY TO DELIVER FOR THEIR

01:36:25.546 --> 01:36:27.348
CONSTITUENTS? AND HOW MUCH DO

01:36:27.414 --> 01:36:28.415
COUNTIES, QUITE FRANKLY, LIKE

01:36:28.482 --> 01:36:30.217
MINE, WHICH IS NOT IN THIS BILL,

01:36:30.284 --> 01:36:32.520
HAVE AN IMPACT OR AN EFFECT ON

01:36:32.586 --> 01:36:35.623
THEIR ABILITY TO TO GET

01:36:35.689 --> 01:36:37.358
RESTITUTION? ABSOLUTELY. AND

01:36:37.424 --> 01:36:40.194
FIRST OF ALL, I BEFORE I WAS

01:36:40.261 --> 01:36:42.496
ELECTED TO TO THE SENATE, I

01:36:42.563 --> 01:36:44.598
SPENT SIX YEARS AS A

01:36:44.665 --> 01:36:45.399
COMMISSIONER ON THE MTC. I

01:36:45.466 --> 01:36:47.168
ACTUALLY WAS REALLY ONE OF THE

01:36:47.234 --> 01:36:49.270
I WAS HAPPY TO BE ELECTED TO

01:36:49.336 --> 01:36:51.405
THE SENATE. I WAS REALLY I WAS

01:36:51.472 --> 01:36:52.640
I LIKED LOCAL GOVERNMENT, BUT I

01:36:52.706 --> 01:36:55.376
WAS VERY SAD TO LEAVE THE MTC.

01:36:55.442 --> 01:36:57.144
I THOUGHT IT WAS. I HAD A

01:36:57.211 --> 01:36:58.312
FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE THERE AND

01:36:58.379 --> 01:37:00.881
A FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE WORKING

01:37:00.948 --> 01:37:03.384
REGIONALLY. I KNOW THE MTC IS

01:37:03.450 --> 01:37:05.085
SOMETIMES A PINATA AND THAT'S

01:37:05.152 --> 01:37:07.321
THE NATURE OF ANY KIND OF

01:37:07.388 --> 01:37:08.622
REGIONAL BODY. THERE'S ALWAYS

01:37:08.689 --> 01:37:11.258
GOING TO BE, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE

01:37:11.325 --> 01:37:12.693
UPSET ABOUT DIFFERENT THINGS,

01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:14.061
SOMETIMES LEGITIMATELY,

01:37:14.128 --> 01:37:15.729
SOMETIMES NOT. THAT BODY WOULD

01:37:15.796 --> 01:37:17.665
WORK REALLY WELL TOGETHER. AND

01:37:17.731 --> 01:37:19.700
I WILL SAY, I'M NOT JUST SAYING

01:37:19.767 --> 01:37:21.735
THIS BECAUSE YOU'RE NORTH BAY.

01:37:21.802 --> 01:37:22.570
THE NORTH BAY COMMISSIONERS

01:37:22.636 --> 01:37:24.171
OFTEN PLAYED AN INCREDIBLY

01:37:24.238 --> 01:37:26.674
PRODUCTIVE ROLE WHEN THERE WERE

01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:28.542
DISPUTES AMONG THE THE LARGER

01:37:28.609 --> 01:37:31.478
COUNTIES. AND I, I AT NO POINT

01:37:31.545 --> 01:37:33.147
HAVE I DID I EVER SEE A

01:37:33.214 --> 01:37:34.348
SITUATION WHERE THE NORTH BAY

01:37:34.415 --> 01:37:35.649
WAS LIKE TARGETING SAN MATEO

01:37:35.716 --> 01:37:37.618
COUNTY. I DON'T REMEMBER THAT.

01:37:37.685 --> 01:37:39.687
SAN MATEO COUNTY HAS TWO

01:37:39.753 --> 01:37:41.522
COMMISSIONERS ON MTC. IN MY

01:37:41.589 --> 01:37:42.323
EXPERIENCE, THEY HAVE ALWAYS

01:37:42.389 --> 01:37:45.259
BEEN VERY STRONG. WHEN I WAS ON

01:37:45.326 --> 01:37:47.428
THERE. KEVIN MULLIN, FORMERLY

01:37:47.494 --> 01:37:48.429
OF THIS BODY, WAS A

01:37:48.495 --> 01:37:50.531
COMMISSIONER ON THE MTC, AN

01:37:50.598 --> 01:37:52.199
AMAZING CITY COUNCIL MEMBER

01:37:52.266 --> 01:37:53.801
FROM REDWOOD CITY, ALICIA

01:37:53.867 --> 01:37:55.236
AGUIRRE WAS ON THERE. ALICIA

01:37:55.302 --> 01:37:57.371
AGUIRRE WAS IN LINE TO BECOME

01:37:57.438 --> 01:37:59.306
THE CHAIR OF THE MTC, BUT THEN

01:37:59.373 --> 01:38:02.376
SHE GOT OUSTED IN THE LOCAL SAN

01:38:02.443 --> 01:38:03.544
MATEO PROCESS, SO SHE WAS NO

01:38:03.611 --> 01:38:05.312
LONGER A COMMISSIONER. ADRIAN,

01:38:05.379 --> 01:38:07.548
WHEN I FIRST CAME ON THE MTC,

01:38:07.615 --> 01:38:09.350
THE CHAIR OF THE MTC WAS ADRIAN

01:38:09.416 --> 01:38:11.418
TISSIER FROM DALY CITY, SAN

01:38:11.485 --> 01:38:14.555
MATEO COUNTY. SO SAN MATEO

01:38:14.622 --> 01:38:15.322
COUNTY HAS BEEN VERY

01:38:15.389 --> 01:38:17.091
EFFECTIVELY REPRESENTED BY VERY

01:38:17.157 --> 01:38:21.428
STRONG COMMISSIONERS ON THE MTC.

01:38:21.495 --> 01:38:23.297
AND, YOU KNOW, AND ALSO

01:38:23.364 --> 01:38:25.466
RELATING TO IN THIS MEASURE, OF

01:38:25.532 --> 01:38:28.969
ALL THE MAJOR OPERATORS, ONLY

01:38:29.036 --> 01:38:31.105
ONE LARGE OPERATOR GETS 100% OF

01:38:31.171 --> 01:38:33.807
ITS FINANCIAL NEED MET. THAT'S

01:38:33.874 --> 01:38:36.543
CALTRAIN. CALTRAIN GETS 100%,

01:38:36.610 --> 01:38:39.013
WHICH IS MOSTLY IN SAN MATEO

01:38:39.079 --> 01:38:41.715
COUNTY. THE OTHERS GET A LOT,

01:38:41.782 --> 01:38:45.252
BUT NOT 100%. CALTRAIN DOES. IN

01:38:45.319 --> 01:38:47.521
ADDITION, AS I DESCRIBED, SAN

01:38:47.588 --> 01:38:50.524
MATEO COUNTY WILL BE ON THE

01:38:50.591 --> 01:38:51.625
ADJUDICATION BODIES FOR

01:38:51.692 --> 01:38:55.663
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR FOR CALTRAIN,

01:38:55.729 --> 01:38:59.199
FOR MUNI, AND FOR BART. I THINK

01:38:59.266 --> 01:39:00.934
THOSE I THINK FOR THOSE THREE,

01:39:01.001 --> 01:39:02.303
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, AND WE'LL

01:39:02.369 --> 01:39:04.672
HAVE AMPLE OPPORTUNITY, FIRST

01:39:04.738 --> 01:39:06.407
OF ALL, FOR ITS BOARD OF

01:39:06.473 --> 01:39:07.374
SUPERVISORS OR SAMTRANS OR CTA

01:39:07.441 --> 01:39:09.443
TO FILE A COMPLAINT. AND THEN

01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:11.512
WE'LL HAVE TWO VOTES ON EACH OF

01:39:11.578 --> 01:39:13.314
THOSE, EITHER TWO OUT OF 6 OR 2

01:39:13.380 --> 01:39:15.816
OUT OF EIGHT, TO BE ABLE TO DO

01:39:15.883 --> 01:39:16.450
AN ADJUDICATION IF THERE'S BEEN

01:39:16.517 --> 01:39:18.319
A PROBLEM. SO I CAN UNDERSTAND,

01:39:18.385 --> 01:39:20.054
YOU CAN ALWAYS SAY IT SHOULD BE

01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:21.322
DIFFERENT, IT SHOULD BE MORE.

01:39:21.388 --> 01:39:22.523
BUT SAN MATEO COUNTY ABSOLUTELY

01:39:22.589 --> 01:39:25.092
HAS A VOICE. AND THE LAST THING

01:39:25.159 --> 01:39:27.728
I WANT TO SAY IN TERMS OF BART,

01:39:27.795 --> 01:39:28.962
BART, THERE ARE SOME ISSUES.

01:39:29.029 --> 01:39:29.563
THERE HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY

01:39:29.630 --> 01:39:31.332
SOME ISSUES WITH BART AND SAN

01:39:31.398 --> 01:39:32.533
MATEO COUNTY. IT'S ALSO TRUE

01:39:32.599 --> 01:39:34.568
THAT THE FREQUENCY OF BART

01:39:34.635 --> 01:39:36.603
TRAINS IN SAN MATEO COUNTY IS

01:39:36.670 --> 01:39:38.339
HIGHER THAN IN CONTRA COSTA

01:39:38.405 --> 01:39:40.307
COUNTY. AND SO, YOU KNOW, TO

01:39:40.374 --> 01:39:42.843
SAY THAT, LIKE BART IS OUT TO

01:39:42.910 --> 01:39:44.978
GET SAN MATEO COUNTY IS JUST

01:39:45.045 --> 01:39:47.247
NOT TRUE. SO BACK TO THE

01:39:47.314 --> 01:39:49.717
QUESTION ABOUT THE OTHER

01:39:49.783 --> 01:39:52.119
COUNTIES OR THAT THEY HAVE WHAT

01:39:52.186 --> 01:39:54.488
I HAVE HEARD KIND OF REFERENCED

01:39:54.555 --> 01:39:56.523
IS THAT IN THE EVENT THAT

01:39:56.590 --> 01:39:57.324
THERE'S AN ADJUDICATION, IN THE

01:39:57.391 --> 01:39:59.827
EVENT THAT THERE'S THE 3.5%

01:39:59.893 --> 01:40:01.595
THAT'S WITHHELD, THAT THAT GOES

01:40:01.662 --> 01:40:02.429
UP TO MTC, THAT THAT'S

01:40:02.496 --> 01:40:05.132
AUTOMATIC. MTC HAS NO ABILITY

01:40:05.199 --> 01:40:07.301
TO OVERTURN THAT. CAN YOU POINT

01:40:07.368 --> 01:40:09.269
IN THE LANGUAGE TO WHERE IT

01:40:09.336 --> 01:40:12.306
SAYS THAT? YES. AND PERHAPS

01:40:12.373 --> 01:40:14.908
PULL THIS OUT AND WE CAN FIND

01:40:14.975 --> 01:40:16.276
IT? NOT IN THE BILL DOESN'T

01:40:16.343 --> 01:40:17.578
REALLY HELP FOR THIS PURPOSES.

01:40:17.644 --> 01:40:19.446
NO, THAT THAT IS RIGHT. I WILL

01:40:19.513 --> 01:40:20.748
ALSO SAY THAT THE ANNUAL

01:40:20.814 --> 01:40:21.815
ALLOCATIONS ARE ARE FIXED

01:40:21.882 --> 01:40:23.150
ESSENTIALLY MINISTERIAL. IT'S A

01:40:23.217 --> 01:40:24.485
FIXED PLAN. THEY CAN'T THEY

01:40:24.551 --> 01:40:27.855
CAN'T BE CHANGED. I WILL ASK MY

01:40:27.921 --> 01:40:28.455
STAFF TO STAFF IS LOOKING FOR

01:40:28.522 --> 01:40:31.024
YOU WHILE STAFF IS LOOKING FOR

01:40:31.091 --> 01:40:33.627
THE CITATION. SO WHEN YOU BRING

01:40:33.694 --> 01:40:37.965
FORWARD COMPLAINTS WE'RE. THIS

01:40:38.031 --> 01:40:43.370
ONE RIGHT HERE. 6770. WE'LL

01:40:43.437 --> 01:40:44.605
GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO POINT IT

01:40:44.671 --> 01:40:46.173
OUT SINCE HE'S NOT PAYING

01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:47.307
ATTENTION TO THE REST. I'M

01:40:47.374 --> 01:40:48.409
SORRY. HE'S UNDERLINING IT.

01:40:48.475 --> 01:40:50.577
I'LL READ IT. YEAH. SO WHEN A

01:40:50.644 --> 01:40:52.246
COMPLAINT IS BROUGHT FORWARD,

01:40:52.312 --> 01:40:55.215
WHAT CRITERIA IS USED ON

01:40:55.282 --> 01:40:57.818
WHETHER TO SUSTAIN OR REJECT

01:40:57.885 --> 01:41:01.288
THAT COMPLAINT? IT'S IT. IT IS.

01:41:01.355 --> 01:41:04.992
IT'S UP TO THE BODY. THEY CAN,

YOU KNOW, THEIR THEIR

FUNDING FOR OTHER FUNDING.

01:41:13.267 --> 01:41:15.235
THERE ARE CRITERIA IN THERE.

80. FIVE I THINK THAT'S

01:43:01.141 --> 01:43:02.943
SOMETHING ELSE. THERE. THERE'S

01:43:03.010 --> 01:43:03.610
SOMETHING ABOUT THE MAINTENANCE.

01:43:03.677 --> 01:43:05.946
LANGUAGE IS DIFFERENT THAT

01:43:06.013 --> 01:43:07.381
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THIS IS

01:43:07.447 --> 01:43:09.516
WHAT I'M REFERRING TO IS THE

01:43:09.583 --> 01:43:10.117
ADJUDICATION. THERE'S ANOTHER

01:43:10.183 --> 01:43:11.385
ONE FOR MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT.

01:43:11.451 --> 01:43:13.387
BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT

01:43:13.453 --> 01:43:14.521
ADJUDICATION. YEAH. AND I'M

01:43:14.588 --> 01:43:16.089
INTERESTED IN THE ADJUDICATION.

01:43:16.156 --> 01:43:17.357
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I HAVE. IT'S

01:43:17.424 --> 01:43:19.226
PAGE 30 AT THE TOP HERE. AND

01:43:19.293 --> 01:43:22.329
WE'LL GO. LET ME SEE IF I CAN

01:43:22.396 --> 01:43:23.530
RECONCILE. IF YOU TURN, IF YOU

01:43:23.597 --> 01:43:25.566

HAVE THIS DOCUMENT AT YOUR DESK

01:43:32.139 --> 01:43:34.641
OKAY. SO NO YOU DON'T OKAY. SO

01:43:34.708 --> 01:43:37.010
WE WANT TO LOOK AT THE DOCUMENT

01:43:37.077 --> 01:43:37.611
THEY HAVE AT THEIR DESK. SO I

01:43:37.678 --> 01:43:39.212
WILL TRY TO RECONCILE DIFFERENT

01:43:39.279 --> 01:43:40.647
VERSION. LET'S TAKE ONE MOMENT.

01:43:40.714 --> 01:43:42.683
IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHAT IS

01:43:42.749 --> 01:43:44.518
THIS QUESTION. YEAH I THINK YOU

01:43:44.585 --> 01:43:46.920
HAVE THE FULL BILL I HAVE THE

01:43:46.987 --> 01:43:47.955
DN FOR THE AMENDMENTS. THAT'S

01:43:48.021 --> 01:43:55.095
THE DIFFERENCE. THE ENHANCED

01:43:55.162 --> 01:43:56.363
ACCOUNTABILITY SECTION JUST FOR

01:43:56.430 --> 01:43:59.833
MEMBERS STARTS ON PAGE 20 AND

01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:04.171
GOES THROUGH PAGE 22. SO IT'S

01:44:04.237 --> 01:44:06.974
GOING TO BE SOMEWHERE IN THERE

01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:11.011
AS HE STARTS TO READ IT. BUT I

01:44:11.078 --> 01:44:12.145
JUST POINT IT OUT FOR THE

01:44:12.212 --> 01:44:16.950
COMMITTEE. SHOULD I READ IT,

01:44:17.017 --> 01:44:19.653
MADAM CHAIR? YES, WE CAN WE CAN

01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:25.392
TRY. HOLD ON ONE SECOND. IT'S

01:44:25.459 --> 01:44:28.261
OKAY. HE IS GOING TO READ ON

01:44:28.328 --> 01:44:30.764
THE DOCUMENTS THAT YOU HAVE ON

01:44:30.831 --> 01:44:33.300
PAGE 22. IT STARTS AT SIX,

01:44:33.367 --> 01:44:36.336
SEVEN, SEVEN, 98 A IT'S MIDWAY

01:44:36.403 --> 01:44:38.405
THROUGH THE PAGE AND THAT'S

01:44:38.472 --> 01:44:39.606
WHERE HE'S GOING TO BE READING

01:44:39.673 --> 01:44:41.274
FROM ON A DIFFERENT DOCUMENT.

01:44:41.341 --> 01:44:48.081
SO THAT'S PAGE 22 670 798A OKAY,

01:44:48.148 --> 01:44:51.184
AFTER AFTER RECEIVING A

01:44:51.251 --> 01:44:53.086
RECOMMENDATION FROM AN AD HOC

01:44:53.153 --> 01:44:54.421
ADJUDICATION COMMITTEE PURSUANT

01:44:54.488 --> 01:44:57.491
TO SECTION 67 786, THE

01:44:57.557 --> 01:45:00.260
COMMISSION SHALL NOT MAY SHALL

01:45:00.327 --> 01:45:01.695
APPROVE THE RECOMMENDATION. AND

01:45:01.762 --> 01:45:03.530
IF THE AD HOC ADJUDICATION

01:45:03.597 --> 01:45:05.265
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDED

01:45:05.332 --> 01:45:06.633
CORRECTIVE ACTION, PROVIDE THE

01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:08.268
SUBJECT OPERATOR WITH A PERIOD

01:45:08.335 --> 01:45:10.504
OF AT LEAST 90 DAYS TO COMPLY,

01:45:10.570 --> 01:45:12.739
AND THEN IT GOES INTO THE REST

01:45:12.806 --> 01:45:15.709
OF THE PROCESS. SO THE MTC HAS

01:45:15.776 --> 01:45:17.644
NO ABILITY TO OVERTURN THAT IN

01:45:17.711 --> 01:45:20.213
THE ORIGINAL. IN THE ORIGINAL

01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:22.616
ACCOUNTABILITY PROPOSAL THAT WE

01:45:22.683 --> 01:45:24.418
MADE, THE MTC WOULD BE THE

01:45:24.484 --> 01:45:25.619
FINAL DECISION MAKER BASED ON A

01:45:25.686 --> 01:45:27.287
RECOMMENDATION FROM THE LOWER

01:45:27.354 --> 01:45:29.523
ACCOUNTABILITY BODY. IT IS NOW

01:45:29.589 --> 01:45:32.492
A SHALL AND I JUST WANT TO

01:45:32.559 --> 01:45:33.660
ACKNOWLEDGE ALSO, EVEN THOUGH

01:45:33.727 --> 01:45:35.328
SOME MEMBER PAP AND I OBVIOUSLY

01:45:35.395 --> 01:45:38.131
HAVE SOME DISAGREEMENTS, SHE

01:45:38.198 --> 01:45:40.500
DID PUSH US TO STRENGTHEN THE

01:45:40.567 --> 01:45:42.269
ACCOUNTABILITY AND I WANT TO

01:45:42.335 --> 01:45:44.304
GIVE HER CREDIT FOR THAT, EVEN

01:45:44.371 --> 01:45:46.373
THOUGH WE DID NOT COME TO AN

01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:47.674
AGREEMENT, IT WOULD NOT HAVE

01:45:47.741 --> 01:45:49.676
BEEN AS STRONG AS IT IS NOW

01:45:49.743 --> 01:45:51.678
WITHOUT HER PUSHING VERY HARD

01:45:51.745 --> 01:45:53.146
ON THAT AND THEN THE CHAIR

01:45:53.213 --> 01:45:54.414
PARTICIPATING IN AN INCREDIBLY

01:45:54.481 --> 01:45:55.615
CONSTRUCTIVE WAY FOR WHICH I'M

01:45:55.682 --> 01:45:58.652
APPRECIATIVE. SO JUST TO MAKE

01:45:58.719 --> 01:45:59.386
SURE I'M UNDERSTANDING ALL OF

01:45:59.453 --> 01:46:01.188
IT TOO. SO THE COMPLAINT COMES

01:46:01.254 --> 01:46:05.092
IN, THE BODY MEETS IF 50% OR

01:46:05.158 --> 01:46:08.495
MORE AGREE THAT THERE'S AN

01:46:08.562 --> 01:46:11.732
ISSUE, 3.5% GETS WITHHELD. YEAH.

01:46:11.798 --> 01:46:14.501
LET'S CLARIFY UP TO COMENZÓ.

01:46:14.568 --> 01:46:18.405
THEY THEY DECIDE 3.5% WITH A

01:46:18.472 --> 01:46:21.241
CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN. THERE'S

01:46:21.308 --> 01:46:24.244
90 DAYS FOR THE OPERATOR TO TRY

01:46:24.311 --> 01:46:26.413
TO CORRECT THAT, THAT ISSUE,

01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:29.316
WHATEVER IT IS, IF IT IS NOT

01:46:29.382 --> 01:46:31.718
CORRECTED, YOU HAVE ANOTHER UP

01:46:31.785 --> 01:46:34.187
TO 3.5%. SO SEVEN TOTAL. YEAH.

01:46:34.254 --> 01:46:37.424
FOR FOR SEVEN TOTAL. AND THEN

01:46:37.491 --> 01:46:39.426
AT 180 DAYS YOU MENTIONED A

01:46:39.493 --> 01:46:41.695
MAJORITY OF THE BOARD. DO YOU

01:46:41.762 --> 01:46:43.497
MEAN OF THE AD HOC THAT'S

01:46:43.563 --> 01:46:44.531
OVERSEEING EACH OF THOSE NOT

01:46:44.598 --> 01:46:46.299
THE MTC BOARD. CORRECT. AFTER

01:46:46.366 --> 01:46:48.468
180 DAYS, A MAJORITY OF THE AD

01:46:48.535 --> 01:46:50.170
HOC COMMITTEE CAN RELEASE THE

01:46:50.237 --> 01:46:52.539
FUNDS, CAN MAKE THE

01:46:52.606 --> 01:46:53.140
DETERMINATION WHETHER THERE'S

01:46:53.206 --> 01:46:54.441
BEEN CORRECTIVE ACTION. AND

01:46:54.508 --> 01:46:56.543
PRIOR TO THAT, IT DOES REQUIRE

01:46:56.610 --> 01:46:58.345
EACH COUNTY TO BE A PART OF

01:46:58.411 --> 01:46:59.613
THAT MAJORITY. SO THAT'S THE

01:46:59.679 --> 01:47:01.248
DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE FIRST

01:47:01.314 --> 01:47:03.784
DAY, DAY ONE TO DAY 180. UP

01:47:03.850 --> 01:47:06.586
UNTIL 180, A COUNTY

01:47:06.653 --> 01:47:07.487
REPRESENTATIVE FROM EACH ONE

01:47:07.554 --> 01:47:10.557
HAS TO BE A PART OF THAT

01:47:10.624 --> 01:47:11.958
MAJORITY. OKAY, GREAT. THANK

01:47:12.025 --> 01:47:14.628
YOU. ALRIGHTY. GOING BACK TO

01:47:14.694 --> 01:47:16.763
ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAPAN, THEN

01:47:16.830 --> 01:47:18.665
FOLLOWED IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING

01:47:18.732 --> 01:47:21.368
ASSEMBLY MEMBER RANSOM. OKAY,

01:47:21.434 --> 01:47:23.503
JUST JUST FOR CLARIFICATION.

01:47:23.570 --> 01:47:25.505
REGULARLY REGULAR MONITORING AS

01:47:25.572 --> 01:47:28.208
IT RELATES TO EFFICIENCY AND

01:47:28.275 --> 01:47:30.343
FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

01:47:30.410 --> 01:47:32.179
REMAINS WITH THE NINE MEMBER

01:47:32.245 --> 01:47:35.382
BOARD. OKAY. YOU ONLY GET ONE

01:47:35.448 --> 01:47:37.284
COMPLAINT PER YEAR, AND THEN

01:47:37.350 --> 01:47:38.418
THAT'S WHEN YOU END UP IN THE

01:47:38.485 --> 01:47:40.554
AD HOC PROCESS. BUT ALL THE

01:47:40.620 --> 01:47:41.321
REGULAR MONITORING, WHICH IS

01:47:41.388 --> 01:47:43.690
WHY I HAVE SUCH DIFFICULTY WITH

01:47:43.757 --> 01:47:45.192
THIS, REMAINS WITH MTC, WHERE

01:47:45.258 --> 01:47:47.394
YOU HAVE FOUR COUNTIES THAT ARE

01:47:47.460 --> 01:47:49.229
NOT A PART OF THIS TAX. WITH

01:47:49.296 --> 01:47:50.864
RESPECT TO MTC VOTING, IT'S

01:47:50.931 --> 01:47:52.799
VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE

01:47:52.866 --> 01:47:55.735
THREE BIGGIES SAN JOSE, OAKLAND,

01:47:55.802 --> 01:47:58.505
SAN FRANCISCO, EACH OF THOSE

01:47:58.572 --> 01:47:59.873
MAYORS ALSO HAVE REPRESENTATION

01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:02.375
ON THE MTC BOARD, SO THEY

01:48:02.442 --> 01:48:06.479
ACTUALLY OUTNUMBER THE FOLKS

01:48:06.546 --> 01:48:08.515
THAT DON'T HAVE THAT

01:48:08.582 --> 01:48:10.350
REPRESENTATION. SO IT'S VERY

01:48:10.417 --> 01:48:12.185
CLEAR TO POINT OUT WE CAN TALK

01:48:12.252 --> 01:48:14.321
HISTORY WHO'S BEEN CHAIR WHEN,

01:48:14.387 --> 01:48:16.489
WHY, WHAT AND HOW. BUT THE

01:48:16.556 --> 01:48:17.624
WEIGHTED VOTING ON THAT BOARD

01:48:17.691 --> 01:48:19.359
IS VERY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND.

01:48:19.426 --> 01:48:22.262
SO IT IS I JUST WANT TO MAKE

01:48:22.329 --> 01:48:23.430
SURE WE'RE VERY CLEAR. AND MY

01:48:23.496 --> 01:48:26.233
OBJECTION IS THAT THE REGULAR

01:48:26.299 --> 01:48:27.400
MONITORING SHOULD BE DONE BY

01:48:27.467 --> 01:48:29.169
THOSE THAT ARE AFFECTED AND

01:48:29.236 --> 01:48:32.939
ONLY THOSE THAT ARE AFFECTED.

01:48:33.006 --> 01:48:35.375
OKAY. AND TO SAY YOU ARE STUCK

01:48:35.442 --> 01:48:38.778
IN THE PETITION PROCESS IS A

01:48:38.845 --> 01:48:40.413
REACTIVE WAY OF MONITORING HOW

01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:43.083
TAX DOLLARS ARE SPENT, NOT A

01:48:43.149 --> 01:48:45.218
PROACTIVE WAY. AND IF YOU

01:48:45.285 --> 01:48:47.320
OPERATE PROACTIVELY, I MEAN, AT

01:48:47.387 --> 01:48:48.788
LEAST I BELIEVE PERHAPS YOU CAN

01:48:48.855 --> 01:48:51.458
STOP ALONG THE WAY. SO IN ANY

01:48:51.524 --> 01:48:53.126
EVENT, THAT'S WHERE. THANK YOU.

01:48:53.193 --> 01:48:54.461
DID YOU WANT TO RESPOND IN ANY

01:48:54.527 --> 01:48:56.563
WAY TO THAT? WE ARE. I KNOW YOU

01:48:56.630 --> 01:48:58.265
GUYS DON'T MEET TILL TWO, BUT

01:48:58.331 --> 01:49:00.300
WE HAVE SESSION AT ONE. AND THE

01:49:00.367 --> 01:49:01.601
LAW, OUR OUR RULES SAY THAT WE

01:49:01.668 --> 01:49:02.502
CANNOT START SESSION WITHOUT

01:49:02.569 --> 01:49:05.272
THIS ENDING. SO IF YOU DON'T,

01:49:05.338 --> 01:49:07.240
I'M GOING TO GO TO ASSEMBLY

01:49:07.307 --> 01:49:09.342
MEMBER RANSOM, WE HAVE ASSEMBLY.

01:49:09.409 --> 01:49:11.578
I'M SORRY, VICE CHAIR DAVIES.

01:49:11.645 --> 01:49:13.914
CAN WE GET A RESPONSE TO THAT?

01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:15.682
SURE. GO AHEAD AND THEN WE'RE

01:49:15.749 --> 01:49:16.416
GOING TO RANSOM VICE CHAIR

01:49:16.483 --> 01:49:18.251
DAVIES. I'M GOING TO MAKE

01:49:18.318 --> 01:49:19.619
REMARKS. WE DO HAVE A MOTION

01:49:19.686 --> 01:49:21.354
AND A SECOND ON THE FLOOR, AND

01:49:21.421 --> 01:49:22.389
WE'LL GIVE AN AUTHOR THE

01:49:22.455 --> 01:49:23.623
OPPORTUNITY TO CLOSE. GO AHEAD.

01:49:23.690 --> 01:49:25.592
SURE. I MEAN, THERE WERE A FEW

01:49:25.659 --> 01:49:27.394
THINGS THAT SAID IT'S ONE PER

01:49:27.460 --> 01:49:28.628
YEAR PER OPERATOR. SO SAN MATEO

01:49:28.695 --> 01:49:30.263
COUNTY WILL BE ABLE TO FILE A

01:49:30.330 --> 01:49:31.464
COMPLAINT ONCE A YEAR AGAINST

01:49:31.531 --> 01:49:33.800
MUNI, ONCE A YEAR AGAINST BART,

01:49:33.867 --> 01:49:34.401
ONCE A YEAR AGAINST CALTRAIN.

01:49:34.467 --> 01:49:35.535
AND, YOU KNOW, GIVEN THAT THE

01:49:35.602 --> 01:49:37.671
THAT THE COMPLAINT PROCESS CAN

01:49:37.737 --> 01:49:39.339
PLAY OUT OVER HALF A YEAR OR

01:49:39.406 --> 01:49:41.374
MORE, YOU CAN IMAGINE IF THERE

01:49:41.441 --> 01:49:44.277
A COUNTY FILING COMPLAINTS AND

01:49:44.344 --> 01:49:46.379
REALLY POTENTIALLY GUMMING UP

01:49:46.446 --> 01:49:48.815
AN OPERATOR. AND THE MOST

01:49:48.882 --> 01:49:49.382
IMPORTANT THING IS FOR THESE

01:49:49.449 --> 01:49:51.284
OPERATORS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

01:49:51.351 --> 01:49:54.321
SERVICE IN TERMS OF, YES,

01:49:54.387 --> 01:49:54.788
THERE'S REPRESENTATION

01:49:54.854 --> 01:49:57.624
DIFFERENT COUNTIES ON THE MTC,

01:49:57.691 --> 01:50:01.261
SANTA CLARA COUNTY AND ALAMEDA

01:50:01.328 --> 01:50:03.430
COUNTY ARE BIGGER COUNTIES THAT

01:50:03.496 --> 01:50:06.232
PAY A LOT OF SALES TAX. IF

01:50:06.299 --> 01:50:07.567
MAYOR MEHAN WERE HERE, HE WOULD

01:50:07.634 --> 01:50:09.536
BE TALKING TO YOU ABOUT HOW

01:50:09.602 --> 01:50:10.337
SANTA CLARA COUNTY IS GOING TO

01:50:10.403 --> 01:50:12.405
PAY. I THINK IT'S MORE THAN A

01:50:12.472 --> 01:50:13.740
QUARTER OF THE REGIONAL SALES

01:50:13.807 --> 01:50:15.108
TAX COMES FROM SANTA CLARA

01:50:15.175 --> 01:50:16.476
COUNTY. SAN FRANCISCO IS GOING

01:50:16.543 --> 01:50:18.545
TO BE PAYING A FULL CENT DOUBLE

01:50:18.611 --> 01:50:19.346
WHAT EVERYONE ELSE IS PAYING.

01:50:19.412 --> 01:50:20.480
SO THERE THERE ARE VARIOUS

01:50:20.547 --> 01:50:22.515
THINGS IN THIS MEASURE THAT

01:50:22.582 --> 01:50:23.249
DIFFERENT COUNTIES CAN COME IN

01:50:23.316 --> 01:50:25.352
AND SAY, HEY, YOU KNOW, I'M

01:50:25.418 --> 01:50:28.188
BEING I'M NOT IDENTICAL TO MY

01:50:28.254 --> 01:50:31.358
NEIGHBOR. AND BUT WE'RE AGAIN,

01:50:31.424 --> 01:50:34.294
THAT'S WHY WE'RE READING, RIGHT?

01:50:34.361 --> 01:50:36.363
WE DON'T HAVE THE GOOD FORTUNE

01:50:36.429 --> 01:50:38.598
OR BAD FORTUNE OF LA BEING ONE

01:50:38.665 --> 01:50:39.399
COUNTY WITH 10 MILLION PEOPLE.

01:50:39.466 --> 01:50:41.534
WE ARE NUMEROUS COUNTIES. AND

01:50:41.601 --> 01:50:43.670
IF WE DON'T WORK TOGETHER, AND

01:50:43.737 --> 01:50:44.604
SOMETIMES THAT MEANS THERE'S

01:50:44.671 --> 01:50:48.708
GIVE AND TAKE THAT, THEN THEN

01:50:48.775 --> 01:50:51.177
WE HAVE A BIG PROBLEM. THANK

01:50:51.244 --> 01:50:53.313
YOU. BART IS AN ELECTED BOARD

01:50:53.380 --> 01:50:55.215
OF DIRECTORS, AND THE OTHER

01:50:55.281 --> 01:50:56.349
AGENCIES HAVE APPOINTED BOARDS

01:50:56.416 --> 01:50:59.052
THAT ARE MADE UP OF MAYORS,

01:50:59.119 --> 01:51:00.553
COUNCIL MEMBERS AND SUPERVISORS.

01:51:00.620 --> 01:51:01.287
SO THERE ARE MECHANISMS TO

01:51:01.354 --> 01:51:03.890
ENSURE THAT THE INPUT OF LOCAL

01:51:03.957 --> 01:51:04.524
GOVERNMENTS ARE INVOLVED IN THE

01:51:04.591 --> 01:51:05.959
DECISION MAKING OF THOSE

01:51:06.026 --> 01:51:07.394
AGENCIES TO ENSURE ONGOING

01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:08.094
IMPLEMENTATION AND

01:51:08.161 --> 01:51:10.230
ACCOUNTABILITY. AND I'LL JUST

01:51:10.296 --> 01:51:12.198
NOTE THAT WE THERE IS THE FIRST

01:51:12.265 --> 01:51:14.434
TIME YOU CAN DO IT IS TWO YEARS.

01:51:14.501 --> 01:51:17.070
SO THERE IS A TIME TO ACTUALLY

01:51:17.137 --> 01:51:18.838
ASSESS PERFORMANCE. AND YOU

01:51:18.905 --> 01:51:20.540
ALSO HAVE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO

01:51:20.607 --> 01:51:22.275
ANY OF THOSE BODY WHO WANT TO

01:51:22.342 --> 01:51:23.643
FILE A PETITION SHOULD WORK

01:51:23.710 --> 01:51:25.245
DIRECTLY WITH THE OPERATOR

01:51:25.311 --> 01:51:27.247
PRIOR TO FILING A PETITION THAT

01:51:27.313 --> 01:51:28.848
IS WRITTEN IN THERE. AND THAT

01:51:28.915 --> 01:51:30.183
WAS ALWAYS IN THERE. AND THEN

01:51:30.250 --> 01:51:32.185
AND THEN YOU FILE A PETITION.

01:51:32.252 --> 01:51:33.319
SO HOPEFULLY IT'S SOMETHING

01:51:33.386 --> 01:51:34.487
THAT'S KNOWN. THAT'S PART OF

01:51:34.554 --> 01:51:36.189
WHY IT TAKES IT COULD TAKE A

01:51:36.256 --> 01:51:37.690
WHOLE YEAR BEFORE SOMETHING IS

01:51:37.757 --> 01:51:38.992
RESOLVED. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:51:39.059 --> 01:51:40.360
RANSOM, VICE CHAIR DAVIES I'M

01:51:40.427 --> 01:51:42.395
GOING TO MAKE REMARKS AND WE'RE

01:51:42.462 --> 01:51:43.596
GOING TO CALL THE QUESTION.

01:51:43.663 --> 01:51:45.298
I'LL BE VERY, VERY BRIEF. THANK

01:51:45.365 --> 01:51:46.966
YOU FOR ALL OF THIS EXCHANGE

01:51:47.033 --> 01:51:48.802
AND THE INFORMATION AND ALL THE

01:51:48.868 --> 01:51:50.236
WORK THAT'S HAPPENED JUST

01:51:50.303 --> 01:51:52.939
REALLY QUICKLY. DOES EVERYONE

01:51:53.006 --> 01:51:54.374
OPTED IN OR WERE THERE SOME

01:51:54.441 --> 01:51:56.009
PEOPLE THAT WERE DRAFTED? IT'S

01:51:56.076 --> 01:51:57.110
MY UNDERSTANDING THAT EVERY

01:51:57.177 --> 01:51:59.345
ENTITY OPTED IN. YES. SO WE

01:51:59.412 --> 01:52:00.580
STARTED WHEN WE FIRST

01:52:00.647 --> 01:52:01.648
INTRODUCED THE BILL EARLY IN

01:52:01.714 --> 01:52:03.349
THE YEAR, IT WAS THE THREE BART

01:52:03.416 --> 01:52:04.384
COUNTIES, BECAUSE THERE WAS

01:52:04.451 --> 01:52:05.652
ALWAYS AN UNDERSTANDING THAT

01:52:05.718 --> 01:52:08.221
THE THREE OF US WANTED TO BE IN,

01:52:08.288 --> 01:52:09.556
AND THAT WAS CONSISTENT LAST

01:52:09.622 --> 01:52:11.191
YEAR, THIS YEAR, AND THEN SAN

01:52:11.257 --> 01:52:13.460
MATEO COUNTY OPTED IN, SANTA

01:52:13.526 --> 01:52:15.195
CLARA COUNTY OPTED IN, AND

01:52:15.261 --> 01:52:16.763
SANTA CLARA COUNTY OPTED IN

01:52:16.830 --> 01:52:18.531
FROM THE VTA BOARD OF DIRECTORS,

01:52:18.598 --> 01:52:20.433
WHICH IS MADE UP OF LOCAL

01:52:20.500 --> 01:52:22.302
ELECTED OFFICIALS, MAYORS,

01:52:22.368 --> 01:52:23.536
SUPERVISORS AND THEN IN SAN

01:52:23.603 --> 01:52:25.205
MATEO COUNTY, THE. THERE WERE

01:52:25.271 --> 01:52:26.406
MULTIPLE VOTES TO OPT IN FROM

01:52:26.473 --> 01:52:30.310
THE SAM TRANS BOARD, FROM THE

01:52:30.376 --> 01:52:32.979
COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY

01:52:33.046 --> 01:52:35.281
BOARD. CÁC, WHICH IS A LOCAL

01:52:35.348 --> 01:52:38.418
GOVERNMENT CONSORTIUM, AND THEN

01:52:38.485 --> 01:52:40.687
CALTRAIN HAD PREVIOUSLY VOTED

01:52:40.753 --> 01:52:42.455
TO SUPPORT. AND THAT'S A THREE

01:52:42.522 --> 01:52:44.924
COUNTY BODY. SO THEY ALL VOTED

01:52:44.991 --> 01:52:46.392
TO BE INCLUDED. SO IF YOU

01:52:46.459 --> 01:52:47.660
DIDN'T OPT IN AND YOU'RE SO

01:52:47.727 --> 01:52:49.429
CLOSE TO ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT

01:52:49.496 --> 01:52:51.464
REGIONS, I MEAN, CLEARLY I IS

01:52:51.531 --> 01:52:53.333
IT KIND OF LIKE YOU, IT ONLY

01:52:53.399 --> 01:52:54.767
MAKES SENSE TO OPT IN.

01:52:54.834 --> 01:52:55.635
OTHERWISE, YOU KNOW, EVERYONE

01:52:55.702 --> 01:52:57.303
ELSE HAS THE FUNDING TO IMPROVE

01:52:57.370 --> 01:52:59.305
AND THEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE

01:52:59.372 --> 01:53:02.642
FUNDING TO IMPROVE. YEAH, THERE

01:53:02.709 --> 01:53:04.544
THERE ARE LIKE AND WE THERE ARE

01:53:04.611 --> 01:53:06.179
IF A COUNTY DOESN'T OPT IN,

01:53:06.246 --> 01:53:07.413
THERE ARE OF COURSE ALWAYS PROS

01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:09.482
AND CONS FOR SAN MATEO COUNTY.

01:53:09.549 --> 01:53:11.284
IF THE COUNTY HADN'T OPTED IN

01:53:11.351 --> 01:53:13.953
THEN IT WOULD FOR ITS OWN SALES

01:53:14.020 --> 01:53:15.221
TAX REAUTHORIZATION WOULD HAVE

01:53:15.288 --> 01:53:16.422
TO PUT MORE MONEY TOWARDS. I

01:53:16.489 --> 01:53:18.558
ASSUME I'VE BEEN TOLD, TOWARDS

01:53:18.625 --> 01:53:20.226
CALTRAIN, BECAUSE IF SAN MATEO

01:53:20.293 --> 01:53:21.361
COUNTY WEREN'T IN, THERE WOULD

01:53:21.427 --> 01:53:22.629
BE NO MONEY FOR CALTRAIN IN

01:53:22.695 --> 01:53:24.130
THIS MEASURE, AND THE THREE

01:53:24.197 --> 01:53:25.131
COUNTIES WOULD HAVE TO

01:53:25.198 --> 01:53:26.266
NEGOTIATE THEIR OWN

01:53:26.332 --> 01:53:27.834
CONTRIBUTIONS. AND I THINK

01:53:27.901 --> 01:53:29.269
THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU LOOK IN SAN

01:53:29.335 --> 01:53:30.537
MATEO COUNTY, IN ADDITION TO

01:53:30.603 --> 01:53:32.572
ALL THOSE OPT IN VOTES, WE'VE

01:53:32.639 --> 01:53:34.807
HAD, YOU KNOW, GOOD SUPPORT

01:53:34.874 --> 01:53:37.210
FROM LABOR, FROM BUSINESS IN

01:53:37.277 --> 01:53:39.746
SAN MATEO COUNTY AND MANY LOCAL

01:53:39.812 --> 01:53:41.581
ELECTED OFFICIALS BECAUSE THEY

01:53:41.648 --> 01:53:43.383
THEY BELIEVE THAT IT'S IN THE

01:53:43.449 --> 01:53:45.118
COUNTY'S INTEREST TO BE IN THE

01:53:45.185 --> 01:53:46.419
IN THE MEASURE. OKAY. I THINK

01:53:46.486 --> 01:53:47.387
YOU ANSWERED PART OF MY

01:53:47.453 --> 01:53:49.756
QUESTION AND THEN MY, MY, MY

01:53:49.822 --> 01:53:50.390
LAST QUESTION AND I'LL MOVE ON.

01:53:50.456 --> 01:53:53.660
SO JUST TO BE CLEAR, AFTER THE

01:53:53.726 --> 01:53:57.330
3.5, IT CAN GO TO A TOTAL OF 7%.

01:53:57.397 --> 01:53:59.599
IF, YOU KNOW, IF ISSUES PERSIST,

01:53:59.666 --> 01:54:01.367
DOES THE FUNDING GO BACK?

01:54:01.434 --> 01:54:03.469
ULTIMATELY, THERE'S A LIST IT

01:54:03.536 --> 01:54:05.972
SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT HELD UNTIL

01:54:06.039 --> 01:54:07.373
THE LAST ALLOCATION. DOES IT

01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:09.209
ULTIMATELY GO BACK TO THAT

01:54:09.275 --> 01:54:11.411
REGION THAT IT WAS HELD FROM OR

01:54:11.477 --> 01:54:12.712
WHERE DOES IT END UP? YEAH. SO

01:54:12.779 --> 01:54:14.414
I MEAN, THE GOAL IS TO GET

01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:15.381
EVERYTHING CORRECTED AND THEN

01:54:15.448 --> 01:54:16.649
IT'S RELEASED. SO THEY'RE NOT

01:54:16.716 --> 01:54:17.850
FORFEITING THE MONEY. RIGHT?

01:54:17.917 --> 01:54:19.485
IT'S BEING HELD AS A CARROT OR

01:54:19.552 --> 01:54:21.588
A STICK. IT'S NEVER FORFEITED

01:54:21.654 --> 01:54:23.356
IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET. IT

01:54:23.423 --> 01:54:24.457
ALWAYS GOES BACK TO THE

01:54:24.524 --> 01:54:25.625
TECHNICALLY UNTIL THE VERY END.

01:54:25.692 --> 01:54:27.360
AT THE VERY END, IF THE AT THE

01:54:27.427 --> 01:54:30.830
AT 15 YEARS FROM NOW, YES, IT

01:54:30.897 --> 01:54:32.298
GOES BACK TO THE COUNTY. IT

01:54:32.365 --> 01:54:33.600
GOES RETURNS TO ITS SOURCE.

01:54:33.666 --> 01:54:35.134
OKAY. ALL RIGHT. THAT ANSWERS

01:54:35.201 --> 01:54:36.436
MY QUESTION. THE SOURCE WAS A

01:54:36.502 --> 01:54:38.738
BIG ISSUE AND THAT'S WHAT I

01:54:38.805 --> 01:54:39.739
WANTED TO BE SURE. THANK YOU.

01:54:39.806 --> 01:54:41.274
THANK YOU, VICE CHAIR DAVIES.

01:54:41.341 --> 01:54:43.509
THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON. JUST

01:54:43.576 --> 01:54:45.345
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. WHEN IT

01:54:45.411 --> 01:54:46.446
COMES TO THIS BILL, I MEAN,

01:54:46.512 --> 01:54:48.781
OBVIOUSLY, I THINK WE ALL KNOW

01:54:48.848 --> 01:54:49.716
THIS YEAR WAS ALL ABOUT

01:54:49.782 --> 01:54:52.018
ACCOUNTABILITY, AFFORDABILITY,

01:54:52.085 --> 01:54:53.953
TRANSPARENCY. AND SINCE I'VE

01:54:54.020 --> 01:54:55.455
BEEN HERE SINCE 2020, REGIONAL

01:54:55.521 --> 01:54:57.390
BILLS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SOMEWHAT

01:54:57.457 --> 01:54:59.425
UP IN THE AIR TO ME, BECAUSE

01:54:59.492 --> 01:55:01.494
YOU'RE HAVING PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:55:01.561 --> 01:55:03.096
IN THIS REGION ARE NOT

01:55:03.162 --> 01:55:04.230
REPRESENTING THESE PEOPLE

01:55:04.297 --> 01:55:06.466
VOTING ON SOMETHING, WHETHER

01:55:06.532 --> 01:55:08.334
YOU AGREE WITH IT OR NOT. AND

01:55:08.401 --> 01:55:11.237
THAT HAPPENED TO US. WHERE? NOT

01:55:11.304 --> 01:55:13.273
THIS AUTHOR. THIS MEMBER NEVER

01:55:13.339 --> 01:55:14.507
EVEN CAME TO HALF OF THE

01:55:14.574 --> 01:55:16.142
MEMBERS THAT WERE REPRESENTING

01:55:16.209 --> 01:55:17.343
ORANGE COUNTY WHEN IT CAME TO

01:55:17.410 --> 01:55:21.214
THIS ISSUE. AND SO TO ME TO

01:55:21.281 --> 01:55:22.448
HAVE PEOPLE VOTING, AND THIS IS

01:55:22.515 --> 01:55:24.951
WHERE I FEEL FOR ME TO BE

01:55:25.018 --> 01:55:26.552
VOTING ON A DISTRICT THAT I

01:55:26.619 --> 01:55:28.154
DON'T REPRESENT, NOT KNOWING,

01:55:28.221 --> 01:55:30.156
YOU KNOW, THAT EVERYONE'S THERE.

01:55:30.223 --> 01:55:31.324
THAT'S MY BIGGEST CONCERN. AND

01:55:31.391 --> 01:55:33.426
I GUESS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

01:55:33.493 --> 01:55:34.894
TRANSPARENCY, I BELIEVE THERE'S

01:55:34.961 --> 01:55:35.428
12 ASSEMBLY MEMBERS THAT

01:55:35.495 --> 01:55:37.630
REPRESENT THESE FIVE COUNTIES.

01:55:37.697 --> 01:55:40.800
IS THAT CORRECT? THE. BAY AREA

01:55:40.867 --> 01:55:43.603
LIKELY. IT'S ABOUT 16 OR 17 OR

01:55:43.670 --> 01:55:44.570
SOMETHING, DEPENDING ON HOW YOU

01:55:44.637 --> 01:55:46.439
DEFINE IT FOR THE QUESTION IS

01:55:46.506 --> 01:55:47.674
PROBABLY A DOZEN. YEAH. HAVE

01:55:47.740 --> 01:55:49.309
YOU SPOKEN TO EVERY ONE OF

01:55:49.375 --> 01:55:51.411
THESE MEMBERS AND HAVE THEY

01:55:51.477 --> 01:55:53.346
EXCEPT RIGHT NOW WE KNOW WITH

01:55:53.413 --> 01:55:55.548
THE ASSEMBLY HAPPEN, HAVE THEY

01:55:55.615 --> 01:55:57.650
ALL APPROVED THIS. AND I'VE, I

01:55:57.717 --> 01:55:59.552
HAVE I HAVE SPOKEN TO EVERY

01:55:59.619 --> 01:56:01.654
MEMBER OF THE BAY AREA

01:56:01.721 --> 01:56:03.456
DELEGATION LAST YEAR. THIS YEAR

01:56:03.523 --> 01:56:05.258
WE HAVE HAD BAY AREA CAUCUS

01:56:05.325 --> 01:56:07.293
MULTIPLE MEETINGS, INCLUDING AS

01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:09.262
LATE AS LAST LAST WEDNESDAY. SO

01:56:09.329 --> 01:56:11.531
ARE YOU. AND SO EVERY MEMBER

01:56:11.597 --> 01:56:13.633
WELL, WE I BELIEVE, IF I RECALL

01:56:13.700 --> 01:56:15.435
CORRECTLY, IN THE SENATE VOTE,

01:56:15.501 --> 01:56:17.870
EVERY BAY AREA SENATOR VOTED

01:56:17.937 --> 01:56:19.372
FOR IT. RIGHT. AND SO I DON'T

01:56:19.439 --> 01:56:22.075
WANT TO SPEAK FOR ANYONE HOW

01:56:22.141 --> 01:56:24.177
THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE. WE HAVE

01:56:24.243 --> 01:56:25.511
BROAD SUPPORT IN THE CAUCUS,

01:56:25.578 --> 01:56:27.413
BAY AREA DELEGATION, OBVIOUSLY

01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:29.949
NOT UNANIMOUS, AND I TOTALLY

01:56:30.016 --> 01:56:32.118
RESPECT THAT. BUT WE YOU KNOW,

01:56:32.185 --> 01:56:33.486
WE HAVE VERY BROAD SUPPORT

01:56:33.553 --> 01:56:36.522
BECAUSE MEMBERS BROADLY

01:56:36.589 --> 01:56:38.858
UNDERSTAND THAT IF WE DO

01:56:38.925 --> 01:56:41.227
NOTHING, BART WILL COLLAPSE AND

01:56:41.294 --> 01:56:43.262
MUNI WILL CUT SERVICE BY 50%

01:56:43.329 --> 01:56:45.465
AND CALTRAIN AND AC TRANSIT

01:56:45.531 --> 01:56:46.232
WILL UNRAVEL. AND THAT WILL BE

01:56:46.299 --> 01:56:48.468
HORRIBLE FOR THE ENTIRE REGION,

01:56:48.534 --> 01:56:50.503
FOR OUR ECONOMY, WHICH, BY THE

01:56:50.570 --> 01:56:51.003
WAY, DISPROPORTIONATELY

01:56:51.070 --> 01:56:52.638
CONTRIBUTES TO THE GENERAL FUND

01:56:52.705 --> 01:56:54.140
OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, SAN

01:56:54.207 --> 01:56:55.341
MATEO COUNTY, SANTA CLARA

01:56:55.408 --> 01:56:57.410
COUNTY, SAN FRANCISCO. IT'S IN

01:56:57.477 --> 01:56:58.945
EVERYONE'S INTEREST FOR THIS

01:56:59.011 --> 01:57:00.279
REGION TO FUNCTION AND NOT TO

01:57:00.346 --> 01:57:03.383
HAVE GRIDLOCK TRAFFIC ALL DAY,

01:57:03.449 --> 01:57:04.417
EVERY DAY, AND TO HAVE PEOPLE

01:57:04.484 --> 01:57:07.487
NOT BE ABLE TO GET TO WORK. AND

01:57:07.553 --> 01:57:08.421
I'LL ASK AS THE QUESTIONS GO

01:57:08.488 --> 01:57:10.590
AND THE COMMENTS COME BACK,

01:57:10.656 --> 01:57:11.724
THAT THEY ARE MORE CONCISE

01:57:11.791 --> 01:57:13.192
BECAUSE WE ARE UNDER A TIME

01:57:13.259 --> 01:57:14.627
LIMIT. BUT I APPRECIATE IT. BUT

01:57:14.694 --> 01:57:16.896
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE.

01:57:16.963 --> 01:57:18.264
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT MY MY

01:57:18.331 --> 01:57:20.433
QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED. WHEN

01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:23.569
YOU COME TO TRANSPARENCY. ALSO,

01:57:23.636 --> 01:57:24.370
HAVE YOU DONE OUTREACH? HAVE

01:57:24.437 --> 01:57:26.472
ALL OF THESE COUNTIES DONE

01:57:26.539 --> 01:57:28.307
OUTREACH TO THE PUBLIC SO THAT

01:57:28.374 --> 01:57:29.475
THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THIS BILL

01:57:29.542 --> 01:57:31.477
IS GOING BEFORE US AND THAT WE

01:57:31.544 --> 01:57:33.012
WOULD BE VOTING FOR SOMETHING

01:57:33.079 --> 01:57:34.514
THAT WOULD POSSIBLY PUT A TAX

01:57:34.580 --> 01:57:36.449
ON? WELL, FIRST OF ALL, THIS

01:57:36.516 --> 01:57:38.451
WILL ONLY HAPPEN IF THE VOTERS

01:57:38.518 --> 01:57:40.553
VOTE FOR IT. SO THAT'S ARE THEY

01:57:40.620 --> 01:57:41.387
AWARE THAT THIS IS EVEN

01:57:41.454 --> 01:57:43.689
HAPPENING HERE? THIS HAS BEEN

01:57:43.756 --> 01:57:45.191
SO HEAVILY COVERED. THERE HAVE

01:57:45.258 --> 01:57:46.559
BEEN SO MANY PUBLIC MEETINGS ON

01:57:46.626 --> 01:57:48.461
THIS, INCLUDING ALL THE

01:57:48.528 --> 01:57:49.228
MEETINGS WHERE VOTES HAVE

01:57:49.295 --> 01:57:50.396
HAPPENED. AND A LOT OF THESE

01:57:50.463 --> 01:57:52.398
AGENCIES HAD MULTIPLE PUBLIC

01:57:52.465 --> 01:57:53.466
HEARINGS BEFORE THEY EVEN GOT

01:57:53.533 --> 01:57:55.668
TO A HEARING WITH A VOTE. SO

01:57:55.735 --> 01:57:56.602
THIS HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLY

01:57:56.669 --> 01:57:59.238
TRANSPARENT AND PUBLIC PROCESS.

01:57:59.305 --> 01:58:01.307
AND THERE'S BEEN POLLING DONE.

01:58:01.374 --> 01:58:02.642
THERE'S BEEN I MEAN, JUST IT

01:58:02.708 --> 01:58:04.277
THIS HAS NOT BEEN SECRETIVE IN

01:58:04.343 --> 01:58:06.679
ANY WAY AND WASN'T SUGGESTING

01:58:06.746 --> 01:58:08.347
THAT IT'S GOING TO MAKE SURE

01:58:08.414 --> 01:58:10.550
THAT WAS OUT THERE. AS ASSEMBLY

01:58:10.616 --> 01:58:12.852
MEMBER PAPPIN HAD SPOKEN

01:58:12.919 --> 01:58:14.320
PERFORMANCE ACTUALLY, BECAUSE

01:58:14.387 --> 01:58:15.555
ACCOUNTABILITY. AND I CAN SEE

01:58:15.621 --> 01:58:17.423
YOU GUYS HAVE GONE VERY EXTREME

01:58:17.490 --> 01:58:18.891
INTO WHAT YOU CONSIDER

01:58:18.958 --> 01:58:20.259
ACCOUNTABILITY. AND THAT'S

01:58:20.326 --> 01:58:22.462
GREAT TO HAVE THAT. I MEAN, WE

01:58:22.528 --> 01:58:24.730
DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ACTUALLY

01:58:24.797 --> 01:58:25.198
GOING TO WORK, BUT THE

01:58:25.264 --> 01:58:26.299
PERFORMANCE MEASURE IS

01:58:26.365 --> 01:58:27.767
SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY

01:58:27.834 --> 01:58:29.101
IMPORTANT TO ME BECAUSE, YOU

01:58:29.168 --> 01:58:30.470
KNOW, YOU CAN LAY THIS OUT

01:58:30.536 --> 01:58:32.839
THERE AND YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF

01:58:32.905 --> 01:58:34.540
COUNTIES AND A LOT OF PEOPLE IN

01:58:34.607 --> 01:58:35.475
CHARGE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING.

01:58:35.541 --> 01:58:37.510
WHAT DO YOU HAVE A PLAN FOR THE

01:58:37.577 --> 01:58:39.545
PERFORMANCE IN REGARDS TO? WHAT

01:58:39.612 --> 01:58:41.481
DO YOU EXPECT TO SEE IN SIX

01:58:41.547 --> 01:58:43.115
MONTHS, WHAT YOU EXPECT TO SEE

01:58:43.182 --> 01:58:45.218
IN ONE YEAR? AND WHAT HAPPENS

01:58:45.284 --> 01:58:46.352
IF ALL OF A SUDDEN THESE

01:58:46.419 --> 01:58:46.953
PERFORMANCES AREN'T MEASURING

01:58:47.019 --> 01:58:48.454
UP? DOES THAT SAY YOU STOP THE

01:58:48.521 --> 01:58:50.756
PEOPLE FROM BEING TAXED OR YOU

01:58:50.823 --> 01:58:52.091
JUST CONTINUE TAXING THEM?

01:58:52.158 --> 01:58:53.526
BECAUSE TO ME, WE'VE SEEN THIS

01:58:53.593 --> 01:58:57.063
IN OTHER TRANSPORTATION

01:58:57.129 --> 01:58:59.332
PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS. AND SO I

01:58:59.398 --> 01:59:00.666
THINK, YOU KNOW, MAKING SURE

01:59:00.733 --> 01:59:02.602
THAT YOU HAVE THAT PERFORMANCE

01:59:02.668 --> 01:59:05.104
MEASUREMENT, YOU KNOW, EVERY

01:59:05.171 --> 01:59:06.472
YEAR I THINK IS REALLY

01:59:06.539 --> 01:59:09.008
IMPORTANT. AND I JUST LIKE I

01:59:09.075 --> 01:59:10.443
SAID, IS IT'S REALLY HARD FOR

01:59:10.510 --> 01:59:12.512
ME TO HAVE TO TALK ON A

01:59:12.578 --> 01:59:14.146
REGIONAL BILL AND VOTE ON A

01:59:14.213 --> 01:59:15.348
REGIONAL BILL WHEN I KNOW THAT

01:59:15.414 --> 01:59:17.283
NOT EVERYBODY THAT THIS WILL BE

01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:19.252
AFFECTING APPROVES IT. AND SO I

01:59:19.318 --> 01:59:21.587
GUESS I AM A LITTLE INTERESTED

01:59:21.654 --> 01:59:23.256
IN THE OPT OUT, YOU KNOW, PART

01:59:23.322 --> 01:59:26.592
OF THAT AS WELL. DID YOU WANT

01:59:26.659 --> 01:59:28.494
TO COMMENT? THESE ARE HEAVILY

01:59:28.561 --> 01:59:30.363
SCRUTINIZED AGENCIES WITH VERY

01:59:30.429 --> 01:59:32.198
REGULAR EVALUATIONS. I WILL SAY

01:59:32.265 --> 01:59:34.734
I'M VERY PROUD THAT MUNI DOES

01:59:34.800 --> 01:59:37.336
EVERY FEW YEARS, A MASSIVE

01:59:37.403 --> 01:59:39.372
SURVEY OF RIDERS AND ITS

01:59:39.438 --> 01:59:40.973
PERFORMANCE AND ITS APPROVAL

01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:42.208
RATINGS AMONG RIDERS ARE THE

01:59:42.275 --> 01:59:44.343
HIGHEST IN ALMOST 30 YEARS.

01:59:44.410 --> 01:59:46.178
BART HAS ALSO DRAMATICALLY

01:59:46.245 --> 01:59:48.414
IMPROVED, AND IT'S REALLY

01:59:48.481 --> 01:59:50.550
IMPORTANT. I KNOW THAT THIS IS

01:59:50.616 --> 01:59:52.285
THIS BILL CREATES A DISTRICT

01:59:52.351 --> 01:59:55.187
FOR THE VOTE TO HAPPEN. SO

01:59:55.254 --> 01:59:56.289
WE'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR WITH

01:59:56.355 --> 01:59:58.457
COUNTIES, THE ABILITY TO OPT

01:59:58.524 --> 02:00:00.192
OUT IS DURING THE LEGISLATIVE

02:00:00.259 --> 02:00:01.527
PROCESS, AND SAN MATEO COUNTY

02:00:01.594 --> 02:00:03.462
AND SANTA CLARA COUNTY OPTED IN.

02:00:03.529 --> 02:00:05.298
AND I WILL TELL YOU THIS

02:00:05.364 --> 02:00:07.333
WEEKEND, WHEN THERE WAS SOME

02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:09.168
TURBULENCE AROUND SANTA CLARA,

02:00:09.235 --> 02:00:10.403
SAN MATEO COUNTY, FOR WHICH

02:00:10.469 --> 02:00:12.505
YOU'VE HEARD PLAY OUT TODAY, I

02:00:12.572 --> 02:00:15.341
WAS CONTACTED BY A WHOLE BUNCH

02:00:15.408 --> 02:00:17.043
OF PEOPLE IN SAN MATEO COUNTY.

02:00:17.109 --> 02:00:18.344
BE LIKE, WE'VE OPTED IN. WE

02:00:18.411 --> 02:00:22.548
WANT TO STAY IN. OKAY. AND ONE

02:00:22.615 --> 02:00:23.316
OTHER CONCERN I HAVE IS WITH

02:00:23.382 --> 02:00:26.852
PROP 13. WE HAD PROPOSITION 218

02:00:26.919 --> 02:00:29.322
WHEN IT CAME TO TAXES. IT WAS

02:00:29.388 --> 02:00:30.990
SUPPOSED TO BE A TWO THIRDS

02:00:31.057 --> 02:00:32.391
VOTE OF THE PEOPLE, SO THAT YOU

02:00:32.458 --> 02:00:34.360
REALLY WOULD HAVE A MAJORITY

02:00:34.427 --> 02:00:36.462
THAT FELT THAT WAY. BUT THIS IS

02:00:36.529 --> 02:00:37.630
NOT A TWO THIRDS. IS THAT

02:00:37.697 --> 02:00:39.365
CORRECT? THE UNDER SUPREME

02:00:39.432 --> 02:00:41.734
COURT PRECEDENT, IF YOU COLLECT

02:00:41.801 --> 02:00:43.669
SIGNATURES, IT'S A MAJORITY. I

02:00:43.736 --> 02:00:45.471
PERSONALLY I LIKE I SUPPORT

02:00:45.538 --> 02:00:47.406
MAJORITY RULE AND I DON'T THINK

02:00:47.473 --> 02:00:51.410
PERSONALLY THAT 33 OR 34% OF

02:00:51.477 --> 02:00:54.213
PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO STOP

02:00:54.280 --> 02:00:56.449
66% OF PEOPLE FROM FIXING

02:00:56.515 --> 02:00:58.384
PROBLEMS IN SOCIETY. THANK YOU

02:00:58.451 --> 02:01:01.921
FOR YOUR WORK ON THAT. BUT I

02:01:01.988 --> 02:01:02.989
JUST NOTICED THIS IS A CITIZENS

02:01:03.055 --> 02:01:04.423
INITIATIVE, A SIGNATURE CITIZEN.

02:01:04.490 --> 02:01:06.559
YEAH, YEAH. SO THAT'S WHY THAT

02:01:06.626 --> 02:01:07.360
DOESN'T APPLY. THANK YOU. THANK

02:01:07.426 --> 02:01:10.730
YOU, VICE CHAIR. ALL RIGHT. SO

02:01:10.796 --> 02:01:12.198
THANK YOU, SENATOR WIENER. YOU

02:01:12.264 --> 02:01:14.333
AND YOUR STAFF AS WELL FOR ALL

02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:15.234
THE WORK THAT'S DONE. AND

02:01:15.301 --> 02:01:16.469
SENATOR ERIC GREEN FOR YOUR

02:01:16.535 --> 02:01:18.604
LEADERSHIP, AND DEFINITELY TO

02:01:18.671 --> 02:01:19.972
ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAPPIN FOR YOUR

02:01:20.039 --> 02:01:22.508
ADVOCACY. A LOT OF WHAT IS IN

02:01:22.575 --> 02:01:23.576
THIS BILL AND THE

02:01:23.643 --> 02:01:24.343
ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES THAT

02:01:24.410 --> 02:01:26.345
HAVE PUT FORTH SO FAR WOULD NOT

02:01:26.412 --> 02:01:27.847
BE THERE WITHOUT THAT. THE

02:01:27.913 --> 02:01:29.115
COVID 19 PANDEMIC HAS BEEN AN

02:01:29.181 --> 02:01:30.316
EARTHQUAKE FOR THE BAY AREA,

02:01:30.383 --> 02:01:31.384
COMPLETELY SHIFTING THE DYNAMIC

02:01:31.450 --> 02:01:33.686
OF HOW WE GET TO WORK AND HOW

02:01:33.753 --> 02:01:35.321
OFTEN WE NEED TO GET TO WORK.

02:01:35.388 --> 02:01:36.722
UNLIKE LOS ANGELES, WHICH

02:01:36.789 --> 02:01:37.757
HEAVILY SUBSIDIZES THEIR PUBLIC

02:01:37.823 --> 02:01:39.158
TRANSIT, WITH THE SALES TAX

02:01:39.225 --> 02:01:40.393
MEASURE, THE BAY AREA HAS BEEN

02:01:40.459 --> 02:01:42.461
ABLE TO RELY MORE HEAVILY ON A

02:01:42.528 --> 02:01:44.263
USER PAY MODEL. THOSE DAYS HAVE

02:01:44.330 --> 02:01:45.498
CHANGED, AND AS WE AS A REGION

02:01:45.564 --> 02:01:47.600
HAVE COME TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE

02:01:47.667 --> 02:01:48.434
OUR WORLD CLASS TRANSIT SYSTEM

02:01:48.501 --> 02:01:50.269
CAN SERVE THOSE WHO ARE

02:01:50.336 --> 02:01:51.604
DEPENDENT ON IT AND CONTINUE TO

02:01:51.671 --> 02:01:53.606
STRENGTHEN OUR ECONOMY BY

02:01:53.673 --> 02:01:54.907
MAKING TRAVEL AROUND OUR REGION

02:01:54.974 --> 02:01:56.609
MORE SEAMLESS. BART, CALTRANS,

02:01:56.676 --> 02:01:59.311
SF, MUNI, AND AC TRANSIT COVER

02:01:59.378 --> 02:02:01.180
80% OF ALL TRANSIT RIDES IN THE

02:02:01.247 --> 02:02:03.683
BAY AREA, AND 30% OF ALL

02:02:03.749 --> 02:02:04.550
TRANSIT RIDERS IN THE STATE.

02:02:04.617 --> 02:02:06.218
THOSE FOUR AGENCIES COMBINED

02:02:06.285 --> 02:02:08.387
FACE A DEFICIT OF OVER 817

02:02:08.454 --> 02:02:11.557
MILLION IN THE COMING YEAR. I

02:02:11.624 --> 02:02:12.358
APPRECIATE THE COOPERATIVE

02:02:12.425 --> 02:02:13.526
PROCESS ACROSS THE REGION. ON

02:02:13.592 --> 02:02:15.995
COMING TOGETHER ON AN X, EXCUSE

02:02:16.062 --> 02:02:18.230
ME, AN EXPENDITURE PLAN THAT

02:02:18.297 --> 02:02:20.533
WILL HELP ENSURE THE HEALTH OF

02:02:20.599 --> 02:02:22.635
OUR TRANSIT AGENCIES. THIS BILL

02:02:22.702 --> 02:02:23.769
HAS STRONG ACCOUNTABILITY

02:02:23.836 --> 02:02:25.271
MEASURES TO NOT JUST SHORE UP

02:02:25.337 --> 02:02:26.872
OUR TRANSIT DISTRICT, BUT ALSO
