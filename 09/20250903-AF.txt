THE FOUNDATION OF CHARACTER

01:02:48.531 --> 01:02:51.367
BEGINS EARLY. I FEEL IT BEGINS

01:02:51.434 --> 01:02:53.503
WITH PARENTS AND WITH THE ADULT

01:02:53.569 --> 01:02:54.670

EARLY IN LIFE, AND IF NURTURED,

01:03:02.411 --> 01:03:04.447
THEY WILL TAKE ROOT AND GROW

01:03:04.514 --> 01:03:05.414
DEEP INTO THE YOUNG HEARTS AND

01:03:05.481 --> 01:03:08.518

01:03:08.584 --> 01:03:10.119
ACTUALLY A FOUNDING LEADER OF

01:03:10.186 --> 01:03:12.688
OUR TEMPLE'S GIRL SCOUT TROOP

01:03:12.755 --> 01:03:15.224
569. SHE ONCE SHARED AN

01:03:15.291 --> 01:03:16.492
INCIDENT THAT OCCURRED DURING A

01:03:16.559 --> 01:03:18.394
PLANNED FRIDAY NIGHT ACTIVITY

01:03:18.461 --> 01:03:21.364
WITH HER CADET GIRL SCOUT TROOP.

01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:23.232
THE PLAN WAS FOR THE GIRLS TO

01:03:23.299 --> 01:03:26.302
BAKE LEMON BARS THE WEEK BEFORE.

01:03:26.369 --> 01:03:28.538
THE GIRLS EXAMINED THE RECIPE,

01:03:28.604 --> 01:03:30.239
AND EACH GIRL CHOSE ONE

01:03:30.306 --> 01:03:31.240
INGREDIENT THAT THEY WOULD

01:03:31.307 --> 01:03:33.276
BRING THE NEXT WEEK. ON THE

01:03:33.342 --> 01:03:35.344
EVENING WHEN THE GIRLS ARRIVED,

01:03:35.411 --> 01:03:36.846
EXCITED TO BAKE THEIR

01:03:36.913 --> 01:03:39.949
COLLECTIVE TREAT, ONE OF THE

01:03:40.016 --> 01:03:41.217
GIRLS WHO AGREED TO BRING THE

01:03:41.284 --> 01:03:44.687
LEMONS ARRIVED EMPTY HANDED.

01:03:44.754 --> 01:03:46.155
THEN, WITH A NONCHALANT SHRUG,

01:03:46.222 --> 01:03:48.824
SHE JUST SAID, OH, I FORGOT THE

01:03:48.891 --> 01:03:51.961
LEMONS. PATTY SAID THERE WAS

01:03:52.028 --> 01:03:53.629
ABSOLUTE SILENCE. I ASKED HER,

01:03:53.696 --> 01:03:55.298
WHAT DID YOU DO? WHAT DID YOU

01:03:55.364 --> 01:03:58.834
SAY? SHE SAID, I DID NOTHING.

01:03:58.901 --> 01:04:00.236
SHE EXPLAINED IT WAS OBVIOUS

01:04:00.303 --> 01:04:01.571
THAT THIS YOUNG GIRL WAS

01:04:01.637 --> 01:04:03.773
ACCUSTOMED TO BEING BAILED OUT

01:04:03.839 --> 01:04:05.408
BY THE ADULTS AROUND HER. SHE

01:04:05.474 --> 01:04:07.443
WAS EXPECTING ONE OF THE

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:09.245
LEADERS TO SAY, OH, THAT'S OKAY,

01:04:09.312 --> 01:04:11.614
I'LL GET SOME. INSTEAD, PATTY

01:04:11.681 --> 01:04:13.316
ALLOWED THE GIRLS TO FEEL THEIR

01:04:13.382 --> 01:04:15.851
SHARED DISAPPOINTMENT. THEN SHE

01:04:15.918 --> 01:04:19.322
ASKED, WELL, WE HAVE NO LEMONS,

01:04:19.388 --> 01:04:22.325
SO WHAT CAN WE DO, GIRLS? THEY

01:04:22.391 --> 01:04:24.293
EXCITEDLY EXPLORED THE TEMPLE

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:25.595
KITCHEN AND FOUND A CAN OF

01:04:25.661 --> 01:04:27.230
CINNAMON. SO WITH THE

01:04:27.296 --> 01:04:29.332
INGREDIENTS THEY HAD, THE GIRLS

01:04:29.398 --> 01:04:31.534
EXPERIMENTED AND ATTEMPTED TO

01:04:31.601 --> 01:04:33.302
BAKE CINNAMON SQUARES AND WAS

01:04:33.369 --> 01:04:35.304
AMAZED AT HOW TOUGH MY GENTLE

01:04:35.371 --> 01:04:38.307
WIFE COULD BE. THEN SHE SAID,

01:04:38.374 --> 01:04:40.176
BECAUSE I CARE FOR EACH OF MY

01:04:40.243 --> 01:04:42.345
GIRLS, THEY HAVE TO LEARN NOW

01:04:42.411 --> 01:04:44.413
THAT PEOPLE ARE DEPENDING ON

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:46.649
THEM AND IF THEY'RE GOING TO

01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:48.284
FAIL, LET THEM LET PEOPLE DOWN

01:04:48.351 --> 01:04:50.253
NOW, WHEN THEY'RE YOUNG, AND

01:04:50.319 --> 01:04:52.488
LET THE FAILURE BE JUST NOT

01:04:52.555 --> 01:04:54.290
REMEMBERING PROMISED LEMONS.

01:04:54.357 --> 01:04:56.792
ALTHOUGH PATTY SHARED THIS WITH

01:04:56.859 --> 01:04:59.328
ME ALMOST 25 YEARS AGO, I WAS

01:04:59.395 --> 01:05:00.162
SO IMPRESSED WITH HER

01:05:00.229 --> 01:05:03.199
LEADERSHIP VISION THAT I ADMIRE

01:05:03.266 --> 01:05:04.367
IT STILL. BUILDING THE

01:05:04.433 --> 01:05:06.535
FOUNDATION OF CHARACTER BEGINS

01:05:06.602 --> 01:05:08.771
EARLY. I FEEL IT BEGINS WITH

01:05:08.838 --> 01:05:10.806
PARENTS AND THE ADULT ROLE

01:05:10.873 --> 01:05:12.675
MODELS IN OUR CHILDREN'S LIVES.

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:15.411
SEEDS OF INTEGRITY AND

01:05:15.478 --> 01:05:16.145
RESPONSIBILITY ARE PLANTED

01:05:16.212 --> 01:05:18.781
EARLY IN LIFE. IT REQUIRES US

01:05:18.848 --> 01:05:21.150
TO TAKE OWNERSHIP OF OUR

01:05:21.217 --> 01:05:23.286
MISTAKES AND GROW FROM THEM.

01:05:23.352 --> 01:05:25.221
THESE SEEDS ARE NURTURED AND

01:05:25.288 --> 01:05:27.423
WILL TAKE ROOT AND GROW DEEP IN

01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:29.125
THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF OUR

01:05:29.191 --> 01:05:31.260
CHILDREN, AND HELP THEM TO

01:05:31.327 --> 01:05:33.129
BECOME LEADERS WHO WILL LIVE

01:05:33.195 --> 01:05:35.631
WITH INTEGRITY AND BE WORTHY OF

01:05:35.698 --> 01:05:38.567
RESPONSIBILITY. NAMO AMIDA

01:29:48.249 --> 01:29:50.318

CREATE NEW FEES OR INCREASE THE

THE DENSITY BONUS LAW AND

01:39:55.589 --> 01:39:57.558
ENSURING THAT THE LAW IS NOT

01:39:57.624 --> 01:39:58.892
GAMED, BUT ACTUALLY DELIVERS

01:39:58.959 --> 01:40:00.394
THE HOMES THAT OUR COMMUNITY

01:40:00.461 --> 01:40:01.462

01:40:21.482 --> 01:40:23.117
DELEGATION IS PRETTY UNITED.

01:40:23.183 --> 01:40:25.519
THIS STEMS FROM A PROJECT THAT

01:40:25.586 --> 01:40:27.221
YOU CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE WHAT

01:40:27.287 --> 01:40:28.389
THIS DEVELOPER DID IN MISSION

01:40:28.455 --> 01:40:31.191
BAY, A COMPLETE VIOLATION OF

01:40:34.294 --> 01:40:36.430
WHILE WE SUPPORT THIS BILL,

01:40:36.497 --> 01:40:39.466
URGE MEMBERS TO RESPECT LOCAL

CONTROL WHEN WE ON THE SIDE OF

01:40:42.636 --> 01:40:43.871
LOCAL CONTROL. PROJECTS LIKE

THESE DON'T KIND OF FALL

01:40:46.206 --> 01:40:48.142
THROUGH ONE OF THESE STATE

01:40:48.208 --> 01:40:49.810
DRIVEN LOOPHOLES. I'M ALL FOR

01:40:49.877 --> 01:40:52.346
MAKING IT EASIER AND MORE

01:40:52.413 --> 01:40:53.514
AFFORDABLE TO BUILD IN THE

01:40:53.580 --> 01:40:54.681
STATE OF CALIFORNIA, BUT

01:40:54.748 --> 01:40:56.283
THERE'S A VARIETY OF WAYS FOR

01:40:56.350 --> 01:40:58.786
US TO DO THAT BY CUTTING RED

01:40:58.852 --> 01:41:00.120
TAPE WITHOUT SACRIFICING LOCAL

01:41:00.187 --> 01:41:02.356

01:41:02.423 --> 01:41:04.124
IT'S A BIPARTISAN BILL. I

01:41:04.191 --> 01:41:05.459

OF OUR DELEGATION IN ADDRESSING

01:41:08.295 --> 01:41:10.297
THIS. UNFORTUNATELY, IT MAY NOT

01:41:10.364 --> 01:41:12.166
SAVE THIS PARTICULAR COMMUNITY

01:41:12.232 --> 01:41:14.301
FROM SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT

01:41:14.368 --> 01:41:16.370
THEY'RE DEALING WITH, BUT WE

01:41:16.437 --> 01:41:19.373
NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF THE OVER

01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:20.374
DENSIFICATION OF OUR

01:41:20.441 --> 01:41:21.208

THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO IS A

01:41:37.357 --> 01:41:38.358
SPONSOR OF THIS LEGISLATION.

01:41:38.425 --> 01:41:39.326
AND I WOULD NOTE AS WELL THAT

01:41:39.393 --> 01:41:41.428
THE STATE DENSITY BONUS LAW WAS

01:41:41.495 --> 01:41:43.096
ENACTED BECAUSE WE DO NEED TO

01:41:43.163 --> 01:41:44.331
DO MORE. WE NEED MORE TOOLS IN

01:41:44.398 --> 01:41:46.300
THE TOOLBOX TO BE ABLE TO

01:41:46.366 --> 01:41:47.468
PRODUCE MORE HOUSING, BUT IN

01:41:47.534 --> 01:41:48.635
PARTICULAR, WHERE THIS LAW HAS

01:41:48.702 --> 01:41:50.204
INTERSECTED WITH LOCAL

01:41:50.270 --> 01:41:51.438
ORDINANCE, WE HAVE FOUND

01:41:51.505 --> 01:41:52.606
CREATIVE LOOPHOLES, CREATIVE

01:41:52.673 --> 01:41:54.208
WORKAROUNDS THAT HAVE CAUSED A

01:41:54.274 --> 01:41:55.476
COMPLICATION ON A SINGULAR

01:41:55.542 --> 01:41:57.344
PROJECT. THAT, OF COURSE, COULD

01:41:57.411 --> 01:41:58.178
HAPPEN IN ANY OF OUR

01:41:58.245 --> 01:41:59.346
COMMUNITIES. WE DO HAVE TO BE

01:41:59.413 --> 01:42:00.581
MORE THOUGHTFUL AND AGGRESSIVE

01:42:00.647 --> 01:42:02.115

BE ABLE TO LIFT THE BARRIERS

01:42:03.550 --> 01:42:05.519
AND MAKE SURE THAT ALL CITIES

01:42:05.586 --> 01:42:06.386
ARE DOING THEIR PARTS, BUT THAT

01:42:06.453 --> 01:42:08.288

01:42:08.355 --> 01:42:09.556

FLOOR, CREATIVE WORKAROUNDS CAN

01:42:17.731 --> 01:42:18.699
STILL PRESENT THEMSELVES. AND

01:42:18.765 --> 01:42:20.167
THAT'S EXACTLY THE ORIGIN OF SB
