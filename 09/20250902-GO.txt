REALIZED THAT IT WAS PERHAPS

00:43:03.347 --> 00:43:07.484

00:43:18.429 --> 00:43:19.430
COLLABORATIVE SPIRIT TO

00:43:19.496 --> 00:43:21.031
ESSENTIALLY UPDATE THIS COMPACT,

00:43:21.098 --> 00:43:23.534
TO BRING IT INTO LINE WITH THE

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:24.535
CURRENT STATE OF THE LAW AND

00:43:24.601 --> 00:43:26.337
OUR MORE RECENT COMPACTS. WHAT

00:43:26.403 --> 00:43:27.538
THAT LOOKS LIKE IN CONCRETE

00:43:27.604 --> 00:43:30.574
TERMS IS THERE ARE CERTAIN

00:43:30.641 --> 00:43:31.342
TERMS THAT CHICKEN RANCH

00:43:31.408 --> 00:43:33.510
SPECIFICALLY SAID WE CAN'T

00:43:33.577 --> 00:43:37.047
BARGAIN FOR IN A COMPACT.

00:43:37.114 --> 00:43:39.149
THINGS LIKE ONEROUS

00:43:39.216 --> 00:43:41.685

REQUIREMENTS, THINGS LIKE THAT.

00:43:49.326 --> 00:43:51.362
SO WE HAVE UPDATED THOSE TERMS

00:43:51.428 --> 00:43:54.298
BY DELETING THE COMPACTS

00:43:54.365 --> 00:43:56.700

LINE WITH OUR RECENT COMPACTS.

00:44:12.583 --> 00:44:14.585
WHAT THAT MEANS CONCRETELY IS

00:44:14.651 --> 00:44:16.920
THERE IS ONE FUND CALLED THE

00:44:16.987 --> 00:44:19.556
SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION FUND THAT

00:44:19.623 --> 00:44:21.392
THE TRIBE PAYS INTO ON A

00:44:21.458 --> 00:44:22.626

NUMBER OF GAMING DEVICES IT

00:44:24.261 --> 00:44:25.429

00:44:25.496 --> 00:44:27.464
CHIEFLY DEFRAY THE STATE'S

00:44:27.531 --> 00:44:30.467

OPERATES OVER 350 DEVICES TO

00:44:38.308 --> 00:44:40.978
MITIGATE IMPACTS TO LOCAL

00:44:41.045 --> 00:44:43.247

DECISION, I THINK IT IS NATURAL

00:46:09.466 --> 00:46:11.568
AND UNDERSTANDABLE FOR THE

00:46:11.635 --> 00:46:13.237
STATE AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS TO

00:46:13.303 --> 00:46:14.538
NOT NECESSARILY ALWAYS AGREE

00:46:14.605 --> 00:46:16.573
ABOUT PRECISELY WHAT THAT

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:19.643

BROADLY SIMILAR TO SOME OF THE

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:45.269
AMENDMENTS I MENTIONED TO

00:46:45.335 --> 00:46:47.404

CHICKEN RANCH TOPICS, THOSE

00:46:49.773 --> 00:46:51.775
FOUR TOPICS I MENTIONED,

00:46:51.842 --> 00:46:54.478
ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND FAMILY

THROUGH 2060, WHICH I BELIEVE

00:47:25.709 --> 00:47:27.945
IF I'M GETTING MY DATES RIGHT,

00:47:28.011 --> 00:47:29.213
