SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES, I RISE

TODAY TO PRESENT ACR 70 TO

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:19.795
PROCLAIM SEPTEMBER AS SUICIDE

01:08:19.862 --> 01:08:22.231
PREVENTION AWARENESS MONTH.

01:08:22.298 --> 01:08:23.999
WHILE THIS IS EXTREMELY HARD

01:08:24.066 --> 01:08:27.303
FOR ME, I AM GRATEFUL TO BE A

01:08:27.369 --> 01:08:28.771
MEMBER OF THIS ESTEEMED BODY,

01:08:28.838 --> 01:08:30.439
TO HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE

01:08:30.506 --> 01:08:32.541
PLATFORM TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT

01:08:32.608 --> 01:08:35.277
A SUBJECT THAT HAS PROFOUNDLY

01:08:35.344 --> 01:08:38.914
IMPACTED ME AND MY FAMILY.

01:08:38.981 --> 01:08:41.183
SUICIDE WAS NOT A TOPIC I SPENT

01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:42.985
MUCH TIME THINKING OR TALKING

01:08:43.052 --> 01:08:46.455
ABOUT BEFORE NOVEMBER 19TH,

01:08:46.522 --> 01:08:49.291
2018, WHEN MY HUSBAND OF 25

01:08:49.358 --> 01:08:52.561
YEARS, TOM, THE FATHER OF OUR

01:08:52.628 --> 01:08:56.832
TWO CHILDREN, DIED BY SUICIDE.

01:08:56.899 --> 01:08:59.802
I AM MOTIVATED TO SPEAK OPENLY

01:08:59.869 --> 01:09:00.970
AND PUBLICLY BECAUSE SUICIDE

01:09:01.036 --> 01:09:04.006
AND MENTAL HEALTH IS

01:09:04.073 --> 01:09:06.075
PREVENTABLE. WE NEED TO PREVENT

01:09:06.141 --> 01:09:07.143
SUICIDE AND MENTAL HEALTH

01:09:07.209 --> 01:09:09.478
CONDITIONS CAN BE TREATED.

01:09:09.545 --> 01:09:12.014
EARLY. IN MY GRIEVING PROCESS,

01:09:12.081 --> 01:09:14.350
I WENT TO A TALK ON SUICIDE AND

01:09:14.416 --> 01:09:15.985
THE SPEAKER ENCOURAGED US TO

01:09:16.051 --> 01:09:19.221
PUT OUR GRIEF TO WORK. THAT

01:09:19.288 --> 01:09:20.990
RESONATED WITH ME. SO I JOINED

01:09:21.056 --> 01:09:22.224
A SUICIDE SURVIVORS GROUP, DID

01:09:22.291 --> 01:09:24.026
THE OVERNIGHT WALK IN SAN

01:09:24.093 --> 01:09:26.028
FRANCISCO TO RAISE MONEY AND

01:09:26.095 --> 01:09:26.762
AWARENESS FOR SUICIDE

01:09:26.829 --> 01:09:28.831
PREVENTION, AUTHORED

01:09:28.898 --> 01:09:30.099
PROCLAMATIONS FROM MY COUNTY

01:09:30.165 --> 01:09:32.134
AND CITIES, AND JOINED THE

01:09:32.201 --> 01:09:32.968
NATIONAL ALLIANCE ON MENTAL

01:09:33.035 --> 01:09:36.572
ILLNESS, THE NAMI BOARD. I THEN

01:09:36.639 --> 01:09:37.439
RAN AND WAS ELECTED TO

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:39.108
REPRESENT THE 28TH ASSEMBLY

01:09:39.174 --> 01:09:40.743
DISTRICT. BECAUSE I WANT TO BE

01:09:40.809 --> 01:09:43.979
A VOICE AND A FACE FOR SUICIDE

01:09:44.046 --> 01:09:45.147
PREVENTION AND AWARENESS, AS

01:09:45.214 --> 01:09:47.950
WELL AS MENTAL HEALTH. I'M

01:09:48.017 --> 01:09:49.218
HONORED TO SERVE AS CHAIR OF

01:09:49.285 --> 01:09:50.886
THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

01:09:50.953 --> 01:09:52.288
CALIFORNIA'S MENTAL HEALTH

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:53.556
CRISIS, AND SERVE WITH MY

01:09:53.622 --> 01:09:56.091
COLLEAGUES WHO CARE DEEPLY

01:09:56.158 --> 01:09:58.727
ABOUT OUR MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS.

01:09:58.794 --> 01:10:01.597
I UNDERSTAND HOW DIFFICULT IT

01:10:01.664 --> 01:10:03.098
IS TO TALK ABOUT SUICIDE AND

01:10:03.165 --> 01:10:06.001
OUR MENTAL HEALTH. IN THE

01:10:06.068 --> 01:10:06.902
BEGINNING, IT WAS EXTREMELY

01:10:06.969 --> 01:10:10.072
HARD FOR ME. BUT NOW, AS MY

01:10:10.139 --> 01:10:12.107
FRIENDS AND FAMILY WILL ATTEST,

01:10:12.174 --> 01:10:15.678
I DO IT OFTEN. I'VE LEARNED A

01:10:15.744 --> 01:10:17.880
LOT ABOUT SUICIDE IN MY JOURNEY,

01:10:17.947 --> 01:10:20.015
AND I'M GRATEFUL TO MY CHILDREN,

01:10:20.082 --> 01:10:22.952
FAMILY, FRIENDS, COWORKERS, AND

01:10:23.018 --> 01:10:24.954
ALL OF YOU HERE ON THE FLOOR

01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:26.889
WHO HAVE SUPPORTED ME ON THIS

01:10:26.956 --> 01:10:29.224
PATH. I WANT TO SHARE SOME

01:10:29.291 --> 01:10:29.959
THINGS I'VE LEARNED ABOUT

01:10:30.025 --> 01:10:32.094
SUICIDE BEYOND THE STATISTICS

01:10:32.161 --> 01:10:33.996
THAT YOU CAN READ IN THE

01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:37.666
RESOLUTION. SUICIDE IS NOT A

01:10:37.733 --> 01:10:39.802
SELFISH ACT. IT IS A

01:10:39.868 --> 01:10:41.170
DEVASTATING OUTCOME OF SOMEONE

01:10:41.236 --> 01:10:43.806
WHO FEELS UTTERLY HOPELESS,

01:10:43.872 --> 01:10:47.042
TRAPPED IN UNBEARABLE PAIN, AND

01:10:47.109 --> 01:10:50.212
NO LONGER AFRAID OF DYING.

01:10:50.279 --> 01:10:52.314
PLEASE DON'T SAY SOMEONE

01:10:52.381 --> 01:10:55.017
COMMITTED SUICIDE. SUICIDE IS

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:59.521
NOT A CRIME. IT'S A RESULT OF

01:10:59.588 --> 01:11:00.823
AN ILLNESS. WE DO NOT SAY

01:11:00.889 --> 01:11:04.460
SOMEONE COMMITTED CANCER. WORDS

01:11:04.526 --> 01:11:07.663
MATTER. SO PLEASE SAY DIED BY

01:11:07.730 --> 01:11:10.733
SUICIDE OR TOOK THEIR OWN LIFE.

01:11:10.799 --> 01:11:12.968
ASKING SOMEONE IF THEY'RE

01:11:13.035 --> 01:11:14.169
THINKING ABOUT SUICIDE WILL NOT

01:11:14.236 --> 01:11:15.771
PUT THE IDEA IN THEIR HEAD.

01:11:15.838 --> 01:11:18.007
MOST WILL BE RELIEVED THAT

01:11:18.073 --> 01:11:20.476
SOMEONE CARES AND IS WILLING TO

01:11:20.542 --> 01:11:23.712
HAVE THAT CRITICAL CONVERSATION.

01:11:23.779 --> 01:11:26.915
GRIEF IS NOT A JOURNEY TO A

01:11:26.982 --> 01:11:28.984
DESTINATION. IT IS SOMETHING WE

01:11:29.051 --> 01:11:33.055
CARRY WITH US EVERY SINGLE DAY.

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:36.325
THE PATH IS NOT STRAIGHT, NOR

01:11:36.392 --> 01:11:39.928
FLAT, NOR ONE DIRECTION. THAT

01:11:39.995 --> 01:11:41.830
STIGMA AROUND SUICIDE IS REAL

01:11:41.897 --> 01:11:46.035
AND EMOTIONS ARE COMPLEX. SO

01:11:46.101 --> 01:11:46.969
PLEASE DON'T ASK IF SOMEONE IS

01:11:47.036 --> 01:11:49.938
DONE GRIEVING OR QUESTION WHY

01:11:50.005 --> 01:11:51.306
THEY CONTINUE TO MAKE THEIR

01:11:51.373 --> 01:11:53.709
LOVED ONE'S BIRTHDAY OR

01:11:53.776 --> 01:11:56.912
ANNIVERSARY A SPECIAL DAY. AND

01:11:56.979 --> 01:11:58.981
IF SOMEONE COULD GET THROUGH

01:11:59.048 --> 01:12:00.883
THAT INTENSE AND SHORT MOMENT

01:12:00.949 --> 01:12:04.053
OF AN ACTIVE SUICIDAL CRISIS,

01:12:04.119 --> 01:12:07.289
CHANCES ARE THEY WILL NOT TAKE

01:12:07.356 --> 01:12:12.628
THEIR OWN LIFE. THAT'S WHY THE

01:12:12.695 --> 01:12:14.063
SEMICOLON HAS BECOME MORE THAN

01:12:14.129 --> 01:12:17.833
PUNCTUATION. IT'S A SYMBOL OF A

01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:21.036
BATTLE FOUGHT A PAUSE THAT

01:12:21.103 --> 01:12:24.573
WASN'T AN ENDING, AND THE

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:26.141
ONGOING NARRATIVE OF MENTAL

01:12:26.208 --> 01:12:29.478
HEALTH. I HAVE A SEMICOLON

01:12:29.545 --> 01:12:31.146
BUTTERFLY PIN FOR EACH OF YOU

01:12:31.213 --> 01:12:32.981
ON YOUR DESK. I HOPE YOU WEAR

01:12:33.048 --> 01:12:35.017
IT PROUDLY. AND WHEN SOMEONE

01:12:35.084 --> 01:12:37.319
ASKS ABOUT THE MEANING, YOU CAN

01:12:37.386 --> 01:12:40.823
TELL THEM. SUICIDE DOES NOT

01:12:40.889 --> 01:12:43.358
DISCRIMINATE. IT IMPACTS ALL

01:12:43.425 --> 01:12:45.794
PEOPLE OF ALL AGES, GENDERS,

01:12:45.861 --> 01:12:48.797
RACE, ETHNICITY, INCOMES,

01:12:48.864 --> 01:12:50.899
SEXUAL ORIENTATIONS. BUT

01:12:50.966 --> 01:12:52.134
SUICIDE NUMBERS ARE HIGHER FOR

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:54.903
WHITE MALES. VETERANS, PEOPLE

01:12:54.970 --> 01:12:57.339
WHO LIVE IN RURAL AREAS OR

01:12:57.406 --> 01:12:59.942
LGBTQ PLUS YOUTH, TRANSGENDER

01:13:00.008 --> 01:13:02.845
ADULTS, MIDDLE AGED ADULTS, AND

01:13:02.911 --> 01:13:06.348
OUR FIRST PEOPLE. SO WHAT CAN

01:13:06.415 --> 01:13:08.984
ALL OF YOU DO TO HELP PREVENT

01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:15.591
SUICIDE? FIRST ON MY LIST. BE

01:13:15.657 --> 01:13:17.993
KIND. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:20.696
SOMEONE IS GOING THROUGH. YOU

01:13:20.763 --> 01:13:23.098
DON'T KNOW THEIR STORY. SO JUST

01:13:23.165 --> 01:13:25.768
BE KIND TO ONE ANOTHER. EVEN TO

01:13:25.834 --> 01:13:29.438
THOSE WHO ARE UNKIND TO YOU.

01:13:29.505 --> 01:13:31.874
PROMOTE THE 988 SUICIDE AND

01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:34.176
CRISIS LIFELINE. THIS LIFELINE

01:13:34.243 --> 01:13:36.345
HAS PROVEN TO BE ESSENTIAL,

01:13:36.411 --> 01:13:38.714
PROVIDING QUICKER ACCESS TO

01:13:38.781 --> 01:13:39.681
CRISIS COUNSELING AND

01:13:39.748 --> 01:13:42.584
CONNECTING PEOPLE WITH LOCAL

01:13:42.651 --> 01:13:43.819
MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES. WE

01:13:43.886 --> 01:13:47.055
MUST DO MORE, NOT LESS, TO

01:13:47.122 --> 01:13:48.791
STRENGTHEN AND EXPAND THIS

01:13:48.857 --> 01:13:52.795
LIFELINE FOR EVERYONE. LET'S

01:13:52.861 --> 01:13:55.264
TALK ABOUT SUICIDE IN THE

01:13:55.330 --> 01:13:57.299
WORKPLACE, SCHOOLS, RELIGIOUS

01:13:57.366 --> 01:14:00.969
INSTITUTIONS AND HOMES. AND NOT

01:14:01.036 --> 01:14:04.273
JUST IN SEPTEMBER. TRAINING IS

01:14:04.339 --> 01:14:05.607
AVAILABLE TO TEACH PEOPLE TO

01:14:05.674 --> 01:14:08.944
IDENTIFY WHO MAY BE AT RISK FOR

01:14:09.011 --> 01:14:11.480
SUICIDE AND HOW TO LINK THEM TO

01:14:11.547 --> 01:14:13.415
CARE AND LEARN. THE WARNING

01:14:13.482 --> 01:14:16.852
SIGNS. IS SOMEONE TALKING ABOUT

01:14:16.919 --> 01:14:19.822
WANTING TO DIE? ARE THEY

01:14:19.888 --> 01:14:20.989
FEELING HOPELESS, MORE ANXIOUS,

01:14:21.056 --> 01:14:23.692
OR FULL OF RAGE? ARE THEY

01:14:23.759 --> 01:14:25.861
WITHDRAWING FROM FRIENDS,

01:14:25.928 --> 01:14:27.429
GIVING AWAY IMPORTANT ITEMS,

01:14:27.496 --> 01:14:29.832
HAVING EXTREME MOOD SWINGS,

01:14:29.898 --> 01:14:32.467
EATING OR SLEEPING MORE? THESE

01:14:32.534 --> 01:14:34.236
ARE JUST SOME OF THE WARNING

01:14:34.303 --> 01:14:39.041
SIGNS. IF YOU HAVE FIREARMS IN

01:14:39.107 --> 01:14:43.612
YOUR HOME. PLEASE STORE THEM

SECURELY. MY HUSBAND DIED AS A

01:14:48.083 --> 01:14:50.285
RESULT OF A SELF-INFLICTED

01:14:50.352 --> 01:14:52.287
GUNSHOT WOUND THAT WAS BROUGHT

01:14:52.354 --> 01:14:57.459
INTO OUR HOUSE. DATA SHOWS

01:14:57.526 --> 01:14:59.294
APPROXIMATELY 46,000 FIREARM

01:14:59.361 --> 01:15:01.964
DEATHS ANNUALLY, WITH SUICIDES

01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:04.066
ACCOUNTING FOR MORE THAN HALF

01:15:04.132 --> 01:15:08.036
OF THESE DEATHS. ASK THE

01:15:08.103 --> 01:15:10.105
DIFFICULT QUESTIONS AND LET THE

01:15:10.172 --> 01:15:13.342
PERSON KNOW THEY ARE NOT ALONE.

01:15:13.408 --> 01:15:18.780
TALK TO THEM. LISTEN, YOU DON'T

01:15:18.847 --> 01:15:21.149
HAVE TO BE AN EXPERT AND IT

01:15:21.216 --> 01:15:24.219
MIGHT FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE. LET

01:15:24.286 --> 01:15:25.687
THEM KNOW THAT HELP IS

ARE EXPERIENCING IS TREATABLE

01:15:30.225 --> 01:15:33.462
AND THAT SUICIDAL FEELINGS ARE

01:15:33.528 --> 01:15:41.270
TEMPORARY. SUICIDE IS FINAL. IF

01:15:41.336 --> 01:15:43.405
YOU ARE HAVING SUICIDAL

01:15:43.472 --> 01:15:44.273
THOUGHTS OR YOU'RE STRUGGLING

01:15:44.339 --> 01:15:47.910
WITH YOUR MENTAL HEALTH, PLEASE,

01:15:47.976 --> 01:15:50.112
PLEASE REACH OUT BY CALLING OR

01:15:50.178 --> 01:15:53.181

TALK TO SOMEONE YOU TRUST. THE

01:15:57.352 --> 01:15:59.988
REALITY IS, EACH AND EVERY ONE

01:16:00.055 --> 01:16:03.759

01:16:03.825 --> 01:16:06.228
HOPELESS, AND HAS BEEN

01:16:06.295 --> 01:16:08.830
DEPRESSED. AND WHILE MANY OF US

01:16:08.897 --> 01:16:11.033
SUFFER IN SILENCE, WE ARE NEVER.

01:16:11.099 --> 01:16:12.734
WE ARE SEEING THE ANXIETY AND

01:16:12.801 --> 01:16:14.903
THE STRESS IN OUR COMMUNITIES

01:16:14.970 --> 01:16:20.375
NOW MORE THAN EVER. AND YET,

01:16:20.442 --> 01:16:24.279
THROUGH THIS PAIN AND FEAR, THE

01:16:24.346 --> 01:16:27.182
GREATEST TRAGEDY WOULD BE IF WE

01:16:27.249 --> 01:16:31.186
DID NOTHING. BECAUSE SILENCE IN

01:16:31.253 --> 01:16:35.190
THE FACE OF SUFFERING IS ITS

01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:41.330
OWN FORM OF VIOLENCE. IN A TIME

01:16:41.396 --> 01:16:43.732
OF GROWING HATRED AND DIVISION,

01:16:43.799 --> 01:16:47.703
PLEASE LET US CHOOSE LOVE. LET

01:16:47.769 --> 01:16:52.641
US CHOOSE KINDNESS. LET US LIFT

01:16:52.708 --> 01:16:55.310
UP OUR MOST VULNERABLE. LET US

01:16:55.377 --> 01:16:57.846
FUND AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE

01:16:57.913 --> 01:17:00.682
MENTAL HEALTH CARE FOR EVERYONE,

01:17:00.749 --> 01:17:04.219
AND LET US BUILD A WORLD WHERE

01:17:04.286 --> 01:17:09.291
EVERY SINGLE PERSON BELIEVES

01:17:09.358 --> 01:17:13.996
THEIR LIFE IS WORTH LIVING. I

01:17:14.062 --> 01:17:14.896

01:17:14.963 --> 01:17:18.133
ABOUT SUICIDE TO KNOW THAT YOUR

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:22.104
LIFE MATTERS. YOUR FAMILY AND

01:17:22.170 --> 01:17:26.241
FRIENDS WILL NOT, WILL NOT BE

01:17:26.308 --> 01:17:29.911
BETTER OFF WITHOUT YOU. TAKE IT

01:17:29.978 --> 01:17:35.217
FROM SOMEONE WHO KNOWS. I

11. THAT NUMBER. SEEMS SO

01:18:19.961 --> 01:18:24.266
SIMPLE, YET IT IT MEANS

01:18:24.332 --> 01:18:27.803
SOMETHING SO SIGNIFICANT TO ME.

01:18:27.869 --> 01:18:38.213
11. I WAS SITTING ON MY COUCH.

01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:45.387
AND I FOUND MYSELF ON THE FLOOR.

01:18:45.454 --> 01:18:48.723
I WAS CURLED UP IN THIS BALL I

01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:50.025
DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE I WAS

01:18:50.092 --> 01:18:55.964
REALIZE I WAS ALREADY THERE.

01:18:56.031 --> 01:19:01.336
AND I STARTED TO CRY. YOU GUYS

01:19:01.403 --> 01:19:03.472
KNOW ME. I'M A PRETTY HAPPY GO

01:19:03.538 --> 01:19:07.008
LUCKY KIND OF GUY. MAN OF FAITH,

FAMILY HAVE EVERYTHING TO LIVE

01:19:09.578 --> 01:19:14.616
FOR. AND YET I FOUND MYSELF ON

01:19:14.683 --> 01:19:21.056
THE GROUND CRYING. SEE, THE

01:19:21.123 --> 01:19:24.126
PREVIOUS 36 MONTHS BEFORE THAT,

01:19:24.192 --> 01:19:27.896
TEN OF MY MARINES DIED BY

01:19:27.963 --> 01:19:32.534
SUICIDE. NOW, ONE WOULD SAY

01:19:32.601 --> 01:19:35.971
THAT YOU COULD SEE IT GOING ON

01:19:36.037 --> 01:19:37.739
IN THEIR LIVES, BUT THESE WERE

01:19:37.806 --> 01:19:40.442
HAPPY GO LUCKY. EVERYTHING WAS

01:19:40.509 --> 01:19:42.144
OKAY. THE MASK THAT THEY WORE

01:19:42.210 --> 01:19:45.514
EVERY SINGLE DAY WAS A MASK

01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:46.982
THAT FOOLED US ALL. AND IT WAS

01:19:47.048 --> 01:19:52.821
THE MASK THAT I WORE MYSELF. 45

01:19:52.888 --> 01:19:56.057
MINUTES PAST. AND THIS LITTLE

01:19:56.124 --> 01:19:59.027
PUPPY ACROSS THE ROOM THAT

01:19:59.094 --> 01:20:01.930
HATED ME SO MUCH SAT THERE AND

01:20:01.997 --> 01:20:07.302
GAVE ME THIS CONFUSED LOOK AS

01:20:07.369 --> 01:20:09.204
TO WHY AM I ON THE GROUND

01:20:09.271 --> 01:20:12.307
CRYING. IT WOULDN'T EVEN COME

01:20:12.374 --> 01:20:15.076
OVER TO GET A SNACK FROM ME,

01:20:15.143 --> 01:20:16.978
BUT IT SAT THERE AND STARED AS

01:20:17.045 --> 01:20:20.115
I CRIED ABOUT THE TEN AND ME

01:20:20.182 --> 01:20:26.221
BEING NUMBER 11. SOME CALL IT

01:20:26.288 --> 01:20:29.758
SUCK STARTING A NINE MIL, SOME

01:20:29.824 --> 01:20:35.964
CALL IT TAKING THE LEAP. I

01:20:36.031 --> 01:20:38.500
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO CALL IT, I

01:20:38.567 --> 01:20:40.001
JUST KNEW I WAS ON THE GROUND

01:20:40.068 --> 01:20:43.338
CRYING. THAT PUPPY MADE ITS WAY

01:20:43.405 --> 01:20:47.142
OVER, STARTED TO LICK MY FACE

01:20:47.209 --> 01:20:55.016
FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES. THAT

01:20:55.083 --> 01:20:59.054
PUPPY WHO DIDN'T LIKE ME. CAME

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:00.922
OVER AND GAVE ME THE LOVE THAT

01:21:00.989 --> 01:21:04.826
I NEEDED. I SAY GOD INTERVENED

01:21:04.893 --> 01:21:06.094
BY USING ONE OF HIS CREATURES

01:21:06.161 --> 01:21:08.063
TO COME OVER AND SHOW ME

01:21:08.129 --> 01:21:10.632
COMFORT, BECAUSE THERE WAS NO

01:21:10.699 --> 01:21:17.005
ONE THERE. I GOT UP AND

01:21:17.072 --> 01:21:18.240
REALIZED THAT I WAS GOING TO BE

01:21:18.306 --> 01:21:20.976
NUMBER 11. I DON'T KNOW HOW I

01:21:21.042 --> 01:21:25.113
GOT THERE, BUT I GOT THERE. AND

01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:27.749
THAT DENTAL FLOSS THREAD OF

01:21:27.816 --> 01:21:31.186
FAITH THAT I HAD, THAT DENTAL

01:21:31.253 --> 01:21:33.154
FLOSS THREAD OF FAITH, IS WHAT

01:21:33.221 --> 01:21:37.859
I CLUNG ON TO. TO GET ME

FOR HELP. I TELL YOU THIS STORY

01:21:46.901 --> 01:21:49.004
AND SOME CALL IT VULNERABILITY,

01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:52.574
BUT I CALL IT. IT'S MY JOB AS A

01:21:52.641 --> 01:21:55.143
LEADER. IT'S MY JOB AS A LEADER

01:21:55.210 --> 01:21:55.877
TO DISPLAY MY VULNERABILITIES

01:21:55.944 --> 01:21:56.911
AND OUR VULNERABILITIES.

01:21:56.978 --> 01:21:58.113

THEY GOT TO HEAR THE STORY FROM

01:22:05.153 --> 01:22:07.756
MY COLLEAGUE AND HER TRAGEDY.

01:22:07.822 --> 01:22:09.524
THEY GET TO HEAR WHAT'S GOING

01:22:09.591 --> 01:22:11.559
ON. WE DON'T KNOW WHO'S

01:22:11.626 --> 01:22:14.229
BATTLING ANYTHING IN THIS ROOM,

01:22:14.296 --> 01:22:17.098

01:23:07.882 --> 01:23:09.084
THING I BELIEVE WE CAN BE

01:23:09.150 --> 01:23:10.719
UNITED ON, WHERE WE STAND

01:23:10.785 --> 01:23:16.524

WE CALL IT THE MINISTRY OF

01:23:27.035 --> 01:23:28.903
PRESENCE, OF JUST BEING THERE

01:23:28.970 --> 01:23:31.306

01:23:31.373 --> 01:23:33.842
THAT ANYONE COULD EVER HAVE,

01:23:33.908 --> 01:23:36.010

01:23:36.077 --> 01:23:37.846
FOR SOMEONE ELSE. SO LET TODAY

01:23:37.912 --> 01:23:41.416
BE ANOTHER REMINDER THAT WE

SOMEONE'S LIFE BY JUST ASKING

01:23:46.855 --> 01:23:49.324

TRAGICALLY, IT HAS NO REGARD

01:24:48.283 --> 01:24:50.118
FOR AGE AND IT IS THE THIRD

01:24:50.185 --> 01:24:51.319
LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR

PERSONS 10 TO 24 YEARS OF AGE

01:24:54.088 --> 01:24:57.525
AND THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF

RAMPANT IN THE STATE OF

01:25:14.175 --> 01:25:15.977
CALIFORNIA, IN OUR NATION, AS A

01:25:16.044 --> 01:25:18.913
STATE AND NATION, WE MUST DO

01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:21.115
MORE TO MAKE MENTAL HEALTH

01:25:21.182 --> 01:25:24.452
SERVICES MORE ACCESSIBLE ACROSS

01:25:24.519 --> 01:25:26.454
EVERY ETHNICITY, EVERY AGE

01:25:26.521 --> 01:25:28.923
GROUP, AND DO ALL WE CAN TO

01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:32.293
REMOVE THE STIGMA OF SEEKING

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:35.029
CARE, OF SEEKING RESOURCES. WE

01:25:35.096 --> 01:25:36.865
MUST COME TOGETHER AND REMOVE

01:25:36.931 --> 01:25:40.735
THAT STIGMA. WE STILL MUST

01:25:40.802 --> 01:25:43.071
ENSURE THAT EVERYONE CAN GET

01:25:43.137 --> 01:25:45.840

RESOURCES, SO THAT CALIFORNIA

01:25:49.878 --> 01:25:52.480
CAN LEAD THE WAY IN THIS HEALTH

01:25:52.547 --> 01:25:54.949
CRISIS. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

01:25:55.016 --> 01:25:56.217
THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT MENTAL

01:25:56.284 --> 01:25:57.719
HEALTH, IT'S AT EVERY

01:25:57.785 --> 01:26:00.255
DISCUSSION THAT TAKES PLACE IN

01:26:00.321 --> 01:26:01.222
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND

01:26:01.289 --> 01:26:02.957
WITHIN THIS BODY, THERE'S NO

01:26:03.024 --> 01:26:04.993
WAY THAT WE COULD TALK ABOUT

01:26:05.059 --> 01:26:06.227
MOVING BUSINESSES FORWARD IN

01:26:06.294 --> 01:26:07.829
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:26:07.896 --> 01:26:09.063
THERE'S NO WAY THAT WE COULD

01:26:09.130 --> 01:26:10.832
TALK ABOUT MOVING THE ECONOMY

01:26:10.899 --> 01:26:13.334
FORWARD UNLESS WE START TO

01:26:13.401 --> 01:26:15.637
TACKLE MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS

01:26:15.703 --> 01:26:16.671
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA,

01:26:16.738 --> 01:26:18.039
IT'S TIME THAT WE PUT THAT

01:26:18.106 --> 01:26:20.241
MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS AS

01:26:20.308 --> 01:26:21.843
NUMBER ONE IN THE STATE OF

01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:23.978
CALIFORNIA, BECAUSE IF WE DON'T

01:26:24.045 --> 01:26:25.179
ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH, HOW CAN

01:26:25.246 --> 01:26:26.948
WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD AS

A THRIVING ECONOMY AND A

01:26:28.783 --> 01:26:30.852
THRIVING POPULATION, A DIVERSE

01:26:30.919 --> 01:26:32.520
POPULATION IN THE STATE OF

01:26:32.587 --> 01:26:35.256

OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA CRUZ.

THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:26:46.367 --> 01:26:48.036

01:26:59.347 --> 01:27:00.181
KNOWN AS SUICIDE PREVENTION

01:27:00.248 --> 01:27:01.816
AWARENESS MONTH, A TIME TO

01:27:01.883 --> 01:27:03.117
ACKNOWLEDGE AND RAISE AWARENESS

01:27:03.184 --> 01:27:05.053
OF SUICIDE PREVENTION SERVICES

01:27:05.119 --> 01:27:07.322
AND MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES.

01:27:07.388 --> 01:27:09.324
THERE HAVE BEEN RISING CASES

01:27:09.390 --> 01:27:10.825
AMONG COMMUNITIES, INCLUDING

01:27:10.892 --> 01:27:12.894
OUR VETERAN RACIAL MINORITIES,

01:27:12.961 --> 01:27:15.129
YOUTH, LGBTQ, PLUS INDIVIDUALS

01:27:15.196 --> 01:27:17.432
AND THOSE IN BOTH URBAN AND

01:27:17.498 --> 01:27:19.300
RURAL AREAS. FOR THE LATINO

01:27:19.367 --> 01:27:21.002
COMMUNITY, THE RATES OF SUICIDE

01:27:21.069 --> 01:27:23.605
HAVE RISEN IN THE LAST DECADE,

01:27:23.671 --> 01:27:26.274
GOING FROM 5.7 PER 1000 PEOPLE

01:27:26.341 --> 01:27:30.511
IN 2011 TO 7.9 PER THOUSAND IN

01:27:30.578 --> 01:27:32.080
2021. STRENGTH LINKED TO

01:27:32.146 --> 01:27:33.881
IMMIGRATION STATUS HAS LED TO

01:27:33.948 --> 01:27:35.817
AN INCREASE IN MENTAL HEALTH

01:27:35.883 --> 01:27:37.251
PROBLEMS IN A CULTURE THAT DOES

01:27:37.318 --> 01:27:39.387
NOT TYPICALLY RECOGNIZE MENTAL

01:27:39.454 --> 01:27:41.222
HEALTH ISSUES, IT IS IMPORTANT

01:27:41.289 --> 01:27:42.924
TO RECOGNIZE THAT SUICIDE IS A

01:27:42.991 --> 01:27:44.025
SERIOUS ISSUE THAT CAN BE

01:27:44.092 --> 01:27:45.693
PREVENTED WHEN SUPPORT IS

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:47.829
AVAILABLE. WE MUST ENSURE THAT

01:27:47.895 --> 01:27:49.097
CALIFORNIA AND OTHER RESOURCES

01:27:49.163 --> 01:27:50.865
ON SUICIDE PREVENTION AND

01:27:50.932 --> 01:27:53.034
MENTAL HEALTH, AND FEEL THAT

01:27:53.101 --> 01:27:55.036
THEY CAN TRULY RELY ON THEM

01:27:55.103 --> 01:27:55.970
WHEN THEY OR A LOVED ONE IS

01:27:56.037 --> 01:27:59.040
HAVING SUICIDAL THOUGHTS. IT IS

01:27:59.107 --> 01:28:00.742
IMPORTANT NOT TO STAY SILENT ON

01:28:00.808 --> 01:28:02.977
THIS ISSUE. WE MUST MAKE SURE

01:28:03.044 --> 01:28:04.178
THAT EVERYONE HAS THE SUPPORT

01:28:04.245 --> 01:28:06.180
SYSTEM AVAILABLE AND ACCESS TO

01:28:06.247 --> 01:28:08.349

SUPPORT OF ACR 70, WHICH

01:28:23.965 --> 01:28:26.401
DECLARES SEPTEMBER AS SUICIDE

01:28:26.467 --> 01:28:27.835
PREVENTION AWARENESS MONTH. I

01:28:27.902 --> 01:28:30.004
WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE MEMBER

01:28:30.071 --> 01:28:30.938

COURAGEOUSLY SHARING THEIR

01:28:36.444 --> 01:28:39.313
STORIES. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT

01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:40.915
WE NEED TO BE DOING, WHICH IS

01:28:40.982 --> 01:28:43.785
TALKING. NOT ONLY TALKING, BUT

01:28:43.851 --> 01:28:45.987
CHECKING IN ON INDIVIDUALS,

01:28:46.054 --> 01:28:49.657
MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE THERE

01:28:49.724 --> 01:28:51.159
FOR THEM. AS AN EDUCATOR, I'VE

01:28:51.225 --> 01:28:53.561
SEEN THE SILENT STRUGGLES OUR

01:28:53.628 --> 01:28:54.996
YOUTH FACE, AND AS A LEGISLATOR,

01:28:55.063 --> 01:28:58.032
I KNOW THESE STRUGGLES AFFECT

01:28:58.099 --> 01:28:59.867
CALIFORNIANS OF EVERY AGE,

01:28:59.934 --> 01:29:02.070
BACKGROUND AND COMMUNITY.

01:29:02.136 --> 01:29:05.506
SUICIDE IS A PUBLIC HEALTH

01:29:05.573 --> 01:29:07.208
CRISIS. EACH LIFE LOST IS NOT

01:29:07.275 --> 01:29:10.244
JUST A STATISTIC. IT IS A

01:29:10.311 --> 01:29:11.579
FAMILY THAT'S DEVASTATED, A

01:29:11.646 --> 01:29:14.248
COMMUNITY IN MOURNING, AND A

01:29:14.315 --> 01:29:15.717
FUTURE CUT SHORT. WE CANNOT

01:29:15.783 --> 01:29:18.319
ALLOW STIGMA TO SILENCE PEOPLE

01:29:18.386 --> 01:29:20.121
WHEN RESOURCES AND COMPASSION

01:29:20.188 --> 01:29:23.124
CAN SAVE LIVES. BY SPEAKING

01:29:23.191 --> 01:29:25.460
OPENLY, WE SEND THE MESSAGE

01:29:25.526 --> 01:29:26.994
THAT IT IS OKAY TO ASK FOR HELP

01:29:27.061 --> 01:29:32.900
AND IT IS OKAY TO NOT BE OKAY.

01:29:32.967 --> 01:29:35.870
LIFELINES LIKE ARE SUICIDE

01:29:35.937 --> 01:29:38.673
PREVENTION, LINE 988 AND OUR

01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:40.875
LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH NETWORKS

01:29:40.942 --> 01:29:43.745
ARE ESSENTIAL, BUT WE MUST DO

01:29:43.811 --> 01:29:45.213
MORE TO EXPAND AWARENESS. SO

01:29:45.279 --> 01:29:47.315
EVERY CALIFORNIAN KNOWS THAT

01:29:47.381 --> 01:29:49.817
HELP IS WITHIN REACH. SUICIDE.

01:29:49.884 --> 01:29:51.619
SUICIDE PREVENTION IS ABOUT

01:29:51.686 --> 01:29:54.222
AWARENESS, COMPASSION AND

01:29:54.288 --> 01:29:55.590
ACTION. IT IS ABOUT ENSURING

01:29:55.656 --> 01:29:57.825
THAT NO ONE FEELS ALONE AND

01:29:57.892 --> 01:29:59.961
THAT EVERY PERSON HAS THE

01:30:00.027 --> 01:30:01.763
CHANCE TO HEAL AND THRIVE.

01:30:01.829 --> 01:30:04.966
COLLEAGUES, I'M PROUD TO STAND

01:30:05.032 --> 01:30:08.402

REAFFIRMING OUR COMMITMENT TO

MEMBER FROM SANTA CRUZ FOR

01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:28.022
SHARING YOUR STORY. TODAY. I

01:30:28.089 --> 01:30:29.891
RISE ON BEHALF OF THE LGBTQ

01:30:29.957 --> 01:30:33.127
CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF ACR 70,

01:30:33.194 --> 01:30:34.162
DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER AS

01:30:34.228 --> 01:30:36.564
SUICIDE PREVENTION AWARENESS

01:30:36.631 --> 01:30:38.866
MONTH. MEMBERS, LIKE MANY OF

01:30:38.933 --> 01:30:41.035
YOU AND MANY OF YOU IN THIS

01:30:41.102 --> 01:30:43.938
ROOM OFF. I'M FRUSTRATED. AND

01:30:44.005 --> 01:30:45.573
LIKE MANY OF YOU, AS YOU HEARD

01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:46.808
FROM THE STORIES, ARE

01:30:46.874 --> 01:30:49.010
HEARTBROKEN. OUR CHILDREN ARE

01:30:49.076 --> 01:30:50.278
DYING NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE

01:30:50.344 --> 01:30:52.647
BROKEN, BUT BECAUSE OUR SYSTEMS

01:30:52.713 --> 01:30:54.081
ARE. BECAUSE THEY ARE TREATED

01:30:54.148 --> 01:30:55.750
AS OUTCASTS, BECAUSE THEY ARE

01:30:55.817 --> 01:30:56.951
BEING TARGETED, ERASED, AND

01:30:57.018 --> 01:30:59.187
USED BY POLITICAL PAWNS, BY A

01:30:59.253 --> 01:31:01.255
FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION THAT HAS

01:31:01.322 --> 01:31:04.091
TURNED CRUELTY INTO POLICY.

01:31:04.158 --> 01:31:06.227
JUST THIS JULY, THE FEDERAL

01:31:06.294 --> 01:31:07.128
ADMINISTRATION CRUELLY SLASHED

01:31:07.195 --> 01:31:08.996
FUNDING FOR LGBTQ+ SUICIDE

01:31:09.063 --> 01:31:10.865
PREVENTION THROUGH THE 980

01:31:10.932 --> 01:31:12.700
LIFELINE, A SERVICE TENS OF

01:31:12.767 --> 01:31:13.901
THOUSANDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE

01:31:13.968 --> 01:31:15.903
DEPENDED ON IN THEIR DARKEST

01:31:15.970 --> 01:31:17.738
MOMENTS, IN THEIR DARKEST HOURS

01:31:17.805 --> 01:31:19.941
AND THEIR DARKEST MINUTES.

01:31:20.007 --> 01:31:21.175
THESE CUTS JUST DIDN'T

01:31:21.242 --> 01:31:22.877
ELIMINATE A PHONE NUMBER. THEY

01:31:22.944 --> 01:31:26.013
SEVERED A LIFELINE. LET ME SAY

01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:26.814
THIS LOUD AND CLEAR THE

01:31:26.881 --> 01:31:28.883
EXISTENCE AND REALITY OF QUEER

01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:31.485
PEOPLE CANNOT AND WILL NOT BE

01:31:31.552 --> 01:31:35.156
ERASED. 20% OF LGBTQ+ STUDENTS

01:31:35.223 --> 01:31:37.892
HAVE ATTEMPTED SUICIDE. THAT IS

01:31:37.959 --> 01:31:39.227
MORE THAN THREE TIMES THE RATE

01:31:39.293 --> 01:31:43.564
OF THEIR NON LGBTQ PLUS PEERS.

01:31:43.631 --> 01:31:45.166
THAT IS NOT A COINCIDENCE. THAT

01:31:45.233 --> 01:31:48.135
IS A CRISIS. SCHOOLS SHOULD BE

01:31:48.202 --> 01:31:49.837
A SAFE PLACE FOR EVERY CHILD TO

01:31:49.904 --> 01:31:51.873
LEARN, TO GROW, AND TO FEEL A

01:31:51.939 --> 01:31:53.741
SENSE OF BELONGING. INSTEAD,

01:31:53.808 --> 01:31:56.177
THEY HAVE BECOME BATTLEGROUNDS.

01:31:56.244 --> 01:31:58.045
YET, ACCORDING TO THE FBI, OUR

01:31:58.112 --> 01:31:59.013
SCHOOLS ARE THE THIRD MOST

01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:02.283
COMMON LOCATION WHERE LGBTQ

01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:03.885
PLUS YOUTH EXPERIENCE HATE

01:32:03.951 --> 01:32:07.321
CRIMES. AND AS WE STAND HERE

01:32:07.388 --> 01:32:09.123
DEBATING AND LEGISLATING,

01:32:09.190 --> 01:32:12.126
SOMEWHERE EVERY 45 SECONDS, AN

01:32:12.193 --> 01:32:15.029
LGBTQ PLUS CHILD FEELS SO

01:32:15.096 --> 01:32:17.999
TARGETED, ISOLATED, ALONE THAT

01:32:18.065 --> 01:32:20.201
THEY CONSIDER THAT THEIR ONLY

01:32:20.268 --> 01:32:22.904
OPTION IS TO END THEIR LIFE,

01:32:22.970 --> 01:32:25.339
NOT BECAUSE THERE IS SOMETHING

01:32:25.406 --> 01:32:26.040
WRONG WITH THEM, BUT BECAUSE

01:32:26.107 --> 01:32:28.109
THEY HAVE BEEN MADE TO FEEL

01:32:28.175 --> 01:32:30.011
LIKE THERE IS. THEY'RE SECOND

01:32:30.077 --> 01:32:32.513
CLASS CITIZENS, LIKE THEY DON'T

01:32:32.580 --> 01:32:34.782
BELONG TO THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE

01:32:34.849 --> 01:32:36.017
WHO MAY BE LISTENING, WHO HAVE

01:32:36.083 --> 01:32:38.119
EVER FELT UNSEEN, UNLOVED, OR

01:32:38.185 --> 01:32:40.855
UNSAFE. PLEASE HEAR THIS. YOU

01:32:40.922 --> 01:32:42.857
MATTER. YOUR LIFE MATTERS, AND

01:32:42.924 --> 01:32:45.126
THIS WORLD IS SO MUCH BETTER

01:32:45.192 --> 01:32:47.762
WITH YOU IN IT. IT DOES GET

01:32:47.828 --> 01:32:49.096
BETTER. AND I, ALONG WITH MY

01:32:49.163 --> 01:32:50.932
COLLEAGUES AND OUR CONSTITUENTS,

01:32:50.998 --> 01:32:52.800
ARE LIVING PROOF OF THAT.

01:32:52.867 --> 01:32:54.135
MEMBERS, THIS IS NOT ABSTRACT.

01:32:54.201 --> 01:32:56.037
THIS IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL. THIS

01:32:56.103 --> 01:32:58.372
IS REAL LIFE. AND IF WE CLAIM

01:32:58.439 --> 01:32:59.206
TO REPRESENT ALL OF

01:32:59.273 --> 01:33:01.108
CALIFORNIANS, THEN WE MUST DO

01:33:01.175 --> 01:33:03.210
BETTER BY ALL CALIFORNIANS,

01:33:03.277 --> 01:33:04.545
ESPECIALLY, ESPECIALLY OUR MOST

01:33:04.612 --> 01:33:06.881
VULNERABLE. SO THE NEXT TIME

01:33:06.948 --> 01:33:08.149
SOMEONE RISES ON THIS FLOOR OR

01:33:08.215 --> 01:33:11.185
YOU HEAR AN ATTACK ON LGBTQ

01:33:11.252 --> 01:33:13.354
PLUS INDIVIDUALS, PLEASE ASK

01:33:13.421 --> 01:33:15.022
THAT QUESTION AND QUESTION THE

01:33:15.089 --> 01:33:17.358
FACT THAT THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE

01:33:17.425 --> 01:33:18.559
SPEAKING OUT AGAINST THAT ARE

01:33:18.626 --> 01:33:19.827
QUESTIONING OUR DIGNITY.

01:33:19.894 --> 01:33:20.861
THEY'RE QUESTIONING THEIR

01:33:20.928 --> 01:33:22.897
RIGHTS AND THEIR VERY EXISTENCE.

01:33:22.964 --> 01:33:25.900
AND REMEMBER THIS YOUR WORDS

01:33:25.967 --> 01:33:29.403
HAVE POWER AND YOUR WORDS CAN

01:33:29.470 --> 01:33:31.005
EITHER SAVE A LIFE OR THEY CAN

01:33:31.072 --> 01:33:34.041
COST ONE. I'LL LEAVE YOU WITH

01:33:34.108 --> 01:33:35.142
THAT. BUT MEMBERS, I

01:33:35.209 --> 01:33:36.243
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE

01:33:36.310 --> 01:33:37.979
AND AGAIN, THANK THE MEMBERS

THROUGH NOW. AND IT'S A HARD

01:34:19.587 --> 01:34:29.997
THING TO LOVE SOMEBODY YOU HATE.

01:34:30.064 --> 01:34:33.601
BUT WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT

01:34:33.667 --> 01:34:37.938
BECAUSE THE FAMILIES. THE ONES

01:34:38.005 --> 01:34:42.043
THAT ARE STRUGGLING. WITH THE

01:34:42.109 --> 01:34:44.145
VOID LEFT THAT THEY WERE NEVER

01:34:44.211 --> 01:34:48.182
AWARE OF. THE WARNING SIGNS

01:34:48.249 --> 01:34:58.392
THAT WERE THERE. TO THINK

01:34:58.459 --> 01:35:01.495
CONSTANTLY ABOUT WHAT YOU COULD

01:35:01.562 --> 01:35:06.700
HAVE DONE MORE. DOESN'T LEAVE

01:35:06.767 --> 01:35:08.936
TO WHAT YOU COULD HAVE BEEN

01:35:09.003 --> 01:35:13.074
PREPARED FOR. YOU COULDN'T HAVE

01:35:13.140 --> 01:35:17.978
BEEN. I JUST WANT TO THANK MY

01:35:18.045 --> 01:35:20.481
COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO, MY

01:35:20.548 --> 01:35:22.950
COLLEAGUE FROM INDIO, SHARING

01:35:23.017 --> 01:35:26.020
THEIR STORY. BECAUSE THIS IS

01:35:26.087 --> 01:35:30.057
ONE THAT I HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT.

01:35:30.124 --> 01:35:31.158
IT'S ONE THAT WE'RE STILL

01:35:31.225 --> 01:35:37.131
PICKING UP THE PIECES. IT'S THE

01:35:37.198 --> 01:35:43.437
ONE THAT. I THINK ABOUT OFTEN.

01:35:43.504 --> 01:35:47.007
AND HOW HE PUT US THROUGH SUCH

01:35:47.074 --> 01:35:50.211
UNIMAGINABLE HELL FOR SO MANY

01:35:50.277 --> 01:35:52.046
REASONS BEYOND ANYBODY COULD

01:35:52.113 --> 01:35:59.019
POSSIBLY IMAGINE. BUT I THINK

01:35:59.086 --> 01:36:02.957
ABOUT MY YOUNGER BROTHER. AND I

01:36:03.023 --> 01:36:05.826
HAVEN'T MET ANYBODY STRONGER

01:36:05.893 --> 01:36:10.231
THAN HIM. AND HOW THIS LAST

01:36:10.297 --> 01:36:12.466
WEEK HE JUST STARTED AT SAC

01:36:12.533 --> 01:36:15.202
STATE, AND HE CALLED ME AND HE

01:36:15.269 --> 01:36:19.507
GOT ALL THE PAPERWORK DONE, AND

01:36:19.573 --> 01:36:28.816
HE SAID. ARE. I JUST WISH DAD

01:36:28.883 --> 01:36:42.029
COULD SEE THAT WE'RE DOING OKAY.

01:36:42.096 --> 01:36:49.170
THAT I WISH HE KNEW THAT. EVEN

01:36:49.236 --> 01:36:51.071
THOUGH WE WENT THROUGH WHAT WE

01:36:51.138 --> 01:36:55.042
WENT THROUGH, WE WERE PREPARED

01:36:55.109 --> 01:36:59.346
TO TAKE CARE OF OUR FAMILY.

01:36:59.413 --> 01:37:03.717
THROUGH THE ENTIRE HELL, AND HE

01:37:03.784 --> 01:37:08.355
HELPED US WITH THAT. COULD I

01:37:08.422 --> 01:37:09.857
ASK YOU ALL TO BE AWARE OF THE

01:37:09.924 --> 01:37:13.661
FAMILIES, THAT IT'S OKAY TO

01:37:13.727 --> 01:37:15.930
TALK ABOUT IT. IT'S OKAY TO BE

01:37:15.996 --> 01:37:18.866
VULNERABLE, TO FIND THE PERSON

01:37:18.933 --> 01:37:21.135
THAT'S STRUGGLING AND SAY, I'M

01:37:21.202 --> 01:37:25.105
THERE FOR YOU TO LOVE SOMEBODY

01:37:25.172 --> 01:37:29.210
THAT YOU HATE, TO HAVE

01:37:29.276 --> 01:37:38.285
COMPASSION. HE WAS A VETERAN.

01:37:38.352 --> 01:37:44.458
HE STRUGGLED HIS ENTIRE LIFE.

01:37:44.525 --> 01:37:46.227
AND I JUST WISH YOU WOULD ASK

01:37:46.293 --> 01:37:50.030
FOR SOME HELP. SO FIND THE

01:37:50.097 --> 01:37:52.066
FAMILY MEMBERS THAT JUST NEED

01:37:52.132 --> 01:38:08.515
HELP. JUST ASK HIM. THANK YOU.

01:38:08.582 --> 01:38:12.186
THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER,

ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY

01:38:21.962 --> 01:38:25.666
MUCH, MR. SPEAKER. AS ALWAYS, I

01:38:25.733 --> 01:38:27.468
WANT TO THANK OUR MEMBER FROM

01:38:27.534 --> 01:38:29.737
SANTA CRUZ WHO CONTINUES TO

01:38:29.803 --> 01:38:31.872
LEAD WITH CONVICTION, WITH

01:38:31.939 --> 01:38:35.175
PURPOSE, WITH COMPASSION AND

01:38:35.242 --> 01:38:38.545
WITH HONESTY. AND IT NEVER

01:38:38.612 --> 01:38:40.481
FAILS THAT THIS PROVIDES AN

01:38:40.547 --> 01:38:41.782
OPPORTUNITY FOR EACH AND EVERY

01:38:41.849 --> 01:38:44.051
ONE OF US TO ACTUALLY WORK

01:38:44.118 --> 01:38:47.154
THROUGH OUR OWN TRAUMAS. TO BE

01:38:47.221 --> 01:38:50.457
ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT MAYBE

01:38:50.524 --> 01:38:54.228
WE CAN ALL DO A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:38:54.295 --> 01:38:56.363
TO ENSURE THAT WE STAY HEALTHY,

01:38:56.430 --> 01:38:58.432
THAT WE CAN ALL DO A LITTLE BIT

01:38:58.499 --> 01:39:00.668
MORE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:39:00.734 --> 01:39:02.703
PEOPLE AROUND US KNOW THAT WE

01:39:02.770 --> 01:39:07.274
CAN BE THERE FOR THEM. AND NO

01:39:07.341 --> 01:39:11.845
MATTER HOW BUSY THAT WE GET.

01:39:11.912 --> 01:39:14.648
THAT WE CAN LEARN TO ENSURE

01:39:14.715 --> 01:39:15.983
THAT PEOPLE WHO COME IN CONTACT

01:39:16.050 --> 01:39:19.086
WITH US KNOW THAT THERE'S

01:39:19.153 --> 01:39:19.953
NOTHING THAT WE CAN NEVER BE

01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:23.190
TOO BUSY TO ENSURE THAT THE

01:39:23.257 --> 01:39:25.426
WORLD WILL JUST STOP FOR

01:39:25.492 --> 01:39:27.127
SOMEONE BECAUSE THEY NEED US AT

01:39:27.194 --> 01:39:32.032
THAT TIME. JUST THIS WEEKEND, I

01:39:32.099 --> 01:39:34.968
HAD A CLOSE FRIEND TALK ABOUT

01:39:35.035 --> 01:39:36.937
THAT THAT DAY THAT THEY EVEN

01:39:37.004 --> 01:39:42.843
HAD THOUGHTS OF SUICIDE. AND I

01:39:42.910 --> 01:39:45.179
HAD SPENT MY ENTIRE DAY WITH

01:39:45.245 --> 01:39:47.715
THIS PERSON AS A TRAINED SOCIAL

01:39:47.781 --> 01:39:52.953
WORKER. I HAD NO CLUE. AND SURE,

01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:55.789
I'M NOT SURE, MR. SPEAKER, IF I

01:39:55.856 --> 01:39:58.726
CAN SAY THIS, BUT HERE WE GO.

01:39:58.792 --> 01:40:02.229
SURE, HE WAS ALL DAY, BUT THAT

01:40:02.296 --> 01:40:07.434
WAS NOTHING NEW. BUT THEN I

01:40:07.501 --> 01:40:09.903
REALIZED WHY ALL DAY SEEMED

01:40:09.970 --> 01:40:14.441
LIKE THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT

01:40:14.508 --> 01:40:17.644
THEY JUST WANTED TO NOT BE

01:40:17.711 --> 01:40:21.715
ALONE THAT DAY. AND IT WASN'T

01:40:21.782 --> 01:40:24.952
UNTIL IT WAS TIME TO SAY, THE

01:40:25.018 --> 01:40:26.553
DAY IS OVER. Y'ALL KNOW WHEN I

01:40:26.620 --> 01:40:28.055
GO TO BED AND IT WAS WAY PAST

01:40:28.122 --> 01:40:33.927
THAT TIME. BUT BEFORE HAD TO

01:40:33.994 --> 01:40:36.430
TELL ME THAT THEY WERE

01:40:36.497 --> 01:40:38.732
STRUGGLING WITH SUICIDAL

01:40:38.799 --> 01:40:42.736
THOUGHTS. AND THEN IT'S THE

01:40:42.803 --> 01:40:44.938
NEXT DAY, AS MANY OF US HAVE TO

01:40:45.005 --> 01:40:47.207
DO. EVEN WHETHER WE GET GOOD

01:40:47.274 --> 01:40:48.909
NEWS OR BAD NEWS, THERE'S STILL

01:40:48.976 --> 01:40:50.511
A FLIGHT THAT WE ALWAYS HAVE TO

01:40:50.577 --> 01:40:55.849
TAKE. BUT IF WE REALIZE THAT

01:40:55.916 --> 01:40:57.384
THERE'S STILL THINGS THAT WE

01:40:57.451 --> 01:40:58.919
CAN DO, EVEN WHEN WE CAN'T

01:40:58.986 --> 01:41:01.288
PHYSICALLY BE THERE WITH THEM.

01:41:01.355 --> 01:41:04.958
SO THAT PERSON WOKE UP WITH A

01:41:05.025 --> 01:41:08.929
MESSAGE FROM ME. AFTER OUR

01:41:08.996 --> 01:41:10.697
FLOOR, AFTER OUR FLOOR SESSION,

01:41:10.764 --> 01:41:12.032
OR EVEN DURING THE FLOOR

01:41:12.099 --> 01:41:14.701
SESSION. THEY'LL ALSO GET A

01:41:14.768 --> 01:41:18.605
MESSAGE FROM ME ASKING IF

01:41:18.672 --> 01:41:20.407
THEY'RE OKAY. AND DID THEY EAT

01:41:20.474 --> 01:41:24.711
SOMETHING TODAY? AND THEN IT IS

01:41:24.778 --> 01:41:26.914
MY INTENTION TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:41:26.980 --> 01:41:28.248
THAT MY VOICE IS THE LAST VOICE

01:41:28.315 --> 01:41:30.284
THAT THEY HEAR BEFORE THEY GO

01:41:30.350 --> 01:41:32.119
TO BED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY

01:41:32.186 --> 01:41:36.123
ARE OKAY. THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT

01:41:36.190 --> 01:41:40.861
WE COME ACROSS EVERY SINGLE DAY.

01:41:40.928 --> 01:41:43.330
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR

01:41:43.397 --> 01:41:46.133
US EVERY SINGLE DAY, AND THEY

01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:49.903
NEED TO KNOW THAT WE'RE NEVER

01:41:49.970 --> 01:41:52.506
TOO BUSY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY

01:41:52.573 --> 01:41:56.777
ARE OKAY. BUT IT HAS TO BE

01:41:56.844 --> 01:41:58.979
INTENTIONAL. IT HAS TO BE

01:41:59.046 --> 01:42:00.247
SOMETHING THAT WE MAKE SURE

01:42:00.314 --> 01:42:02.082
THAT WE DO, BECAUSE THE LAST

01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:04.718
THING WE WANT TO HAPPEN IS TO

01:42:04.785 --> 01:42:10.457
BE IN A SITUATION WHERE SOMEONE

01:42:10.524 --> 01:42:12.960
TAKES THEIR OWN LIFE, AND WE

01:42:13.026 --> 01:42:15.796
DID NOT PROVIDE THAT

01:42:15.863 --> 01:42:17.831
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THAT ONE

01:42:17.898 --> 01:42:21.368
CONVERSATION. AND WHEN I ASKED

01:42:21.435 --> 01:42:23.770
MY FRIEND, WELL, WHY DO YOU ARE

01:42:23.837 --> 01:42:24.838
YOU HAVING THESE THOUGHTS? HE

01:42:24.905 --> 01:42:28.408
JUST SIMPLY SAID, I'M JUST

01:42:28.475 --> 01:42:36.817
TIRED. I'M JUST TIRED. AND THEN

01:42:36.884 --> 01:42:38.986
I THINK ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE

01:42:39.052 --> 01:42:41.355
AROUND THIS WORLD AND AMONGST

01:42:41.421 --> 01:42:43.390
US, AND EVEN MANY OF US ARE

01:42:43.457 --> 01:42:47.160
JUST TIRED. TO GET OUT OF BED

01:42:47.227 --> 01:42:50.731
TO EAT SOMETHING. HOW MANY

01:42:50.797 --> 01:42:52.399
PEOPLE ARE JUST TIRED OF JUST

01:42:52.466 --> 01:42:56.436
TRYING TO SURVIVE EVERY DAY?

01:42:56.503 --> 01:42:59.206
TIRED OF BEING ANXIOUS, TIRED

01:42:59.273 --> 01:43:01.909
OF BEING SCARED, TIRED OF BEING

01:43:01.975 --> 01:43:07.614
DEPRESSED. BUT ONE THING IS FOR

01:43:07.681 --> 01:43:10.884
SURE. AND THAT IS IF WE CAN

01:43:10.951 --> 01:43:14.121
JUST GET OUT OF BED EVERY DAY.

01:43:14.187 --> 01:43:18.825
WE KNOW WE CAN MAKE IT. AND SO

01:43:18.892 --> 01:43:21.595
AS WE MAKE DECISIONS HERE ON

01:43:21.662 --> 01:43:22.596
THIS FLOOR, HOPEFULLY WE

01:43:22.663 --> 01:43:26.633
CONTINUE TO MAKE DECISIONS OR

01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:27.968
MAKE MORE DECISIONS THAT MAKE

01:43:28.035 --> 01:43:31.004
IT LESS STRESSFUL FOR PEOPLE TO

01:43:31.071 --> 01:43:34.241
LIVE HERE, TO MAKE IT LESS

01:43:34.308 --> 01:43:36.243
STRESSFUL, TO GET THE BASIC

01:43:36.310 --> 01:43:39.046
NECESSITIES OF LIFE AND TO MAKE

01:43:39.112 --> 01:43:42.616
IT MORE ACCESSIBLE, TO GET THE

01:43:42.683 --> 01:43:45.218
EVERYDAY NECESSITIES, BUT ALSO

01:43:45.285 --> 01:43:47.588
THE MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT THAT

01:43:47.654 --> 01:43:49.856
PEOPLE NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT

01:43:49.923 --> 01:43:53.026
AND HOW THEY NEED IT. I

01:43:53.093 --> 01:43:54.094
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE

01:43:54.161 --> 01:43:58.899

WISH I COULD HAVE TALKED HIM

01:44:44.177 --> 01:44:46.179
OUT OF IT. I WISH HE KNEW THAT

01:44:46.246 --> 01:44:47.881
HE COULD REACH OUT TO ME. SO I

01:44:47.948 --> 01:44:50.117

01:45:29.156 --> 01:45:31.291

AAPI LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS, I URGE

01:45:49.176 --> 01:45:50.343

SO MUCH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. FONG,

01:46:02.355 --> 01:46:04.157
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. LACKEY, YOU

01:46:04.224 --> 01:46:08.895
ARE RECOGNIZED. WELL. CLEARLY

01:46:08.962 --> 01:46:13.800
THIS IS A VERY SACRED, AWKWARD

01:46:13.867 --> 01:46:16.837
AND DIFFICULT THING TO TALK

01:46:16.903 --> 01:46:20.173
ABOUT. AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW

01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:22.442
THAT I'VE UNFORTUNATELY HAD TO

01:46:22.509 --> 01:46:26.713
WITNESS A COUPLE SUICIDES. AND

01:46:26.780 --> 01:46:29.950
IT'S HARD TO CHASE THOSE

01:46:30.016 --> 01:46:34.020
MEMORIES AWAY. JUST WITHIN THIS

01:46:34.087 --> 01:46:36.790
LAST COUPLE MONTHS. A DEAR

01:46:36.857 --> 01:46:41.928
FRIEND OF MINE. HAD THIS HAPPEN

01:46:41.995 --> 01:46:45.232
UNTO HER, HER LIFE, AND I WENT

01:46:45.298 --> 01:46:47.033
OVER TO SPEAK WITH HER. AND

01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:50.470
WHAT AN AWKWARD POSITION TO BE

01:46:50.537 --> 01:46:53.073
IN TO, BECAUSE YOU WANT TO NOT

01:46:53.140 --> 01:46:54.841
JUST HUG THEM, BUT YOU WANT TO

01:46:54.908 --> 01:46:57.377
GIVE THEM SOME KIND OF SUPPORT.

01:46:57.444 --> 01:46:58.178
BUT IT'S VERY, VERY DIFFICULT.

01:46:58.245 --> 01:46:59.713
AND THAT'S THE REASON WHY OUR

01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:01.948
SOCIETY IS HAVING SUCH A

01:47:02.015 --> 01:47:02.849
DIFFICULTY WITH THIS. AND I'M

01:47:02.916 --> 01:47:04.918
VERY, VERY THANKFUL THAT WE'RE

01:47:04.985 --> 01:47:07.087
TALKING ABOUT IT, BECAUSE THAT

01:47:07.154 --> 01:47:09.022
IS WHAT WE HAVEN'T DONE IN THE

01:47:09.089 --> 01:47:11.958
PAST. OBVIOUSLY, I'M NOT A

01:47:12.025 --> 01:47:13.326
YOUNG MAN, AND I'M TELLING YOU,

01:47:13.393 --> 01:47:15.562
THE WAY WE'VE MANAGED THIS

01:47:15.629 --> 01:47:17.230
DIFFICULT TOPIC HAS BEEN VERY

01:47:17.297 --> 01:47:20.734
UNSUCCESSFUL. AND I'M NOT

01:47:20.801 --> 01:47:21.802
SAYING THAT THERE'S ANY SIMPLE

01:47:21.868 --> 01:47:25.672
ANSWER. BUT I WILL TELL YOU

01:47:25.739 --> 01:47:27.974
THAT IT IS SO POWERFUL. I HAD A

01:47:28.041 --> 01:47:30.877
PARTNER OF MINE WHO WAS

01:47:30.944 --> 01:47:35.649
INVOLVED IN A. OFFICER-INVOLVED

01:47:35.715 --> 01:47:39.152
SHOOTING, AND IT WAS THE RESULT

01:47:39.219 --> 01:47:40.821
OF A STRUGGLE FOR HIS WEAPON,

01:47:40.887 --> 01:47:44.825
AND HE FOUND OUT, AND HE HAD TO

01:47:44.891 --> 01:47:46.059
END THE LIFE OF THIS OTHER

01:47:46.126 --> 01:47:48.428
INDIVIDUAL. AND HE FOUND OUT

01:47:48.495 --> 01:47:50.230
THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL HAD NO

01:47:50.297 --> 01:47:54.868
CRIMINAL HISTORY. SO HE FELT

01:47:54.935 --> 01:47:57.037
LIKE MAYBE HE OVERREACTED. AND

01:47:57.103 --> 01:47:59.039
HE SECOND GUESSED HIMSELF TO

01:47:59.105 --> 01:48:01.208
THE POINT TO WHERE HE STARTED

01:48:01.274 --> 01:48:02.876
DRINKING. HE WAS NOT A DRINKER,

01:48:02.943 --> 01:48:04.978
AND HE WAS A VERY QUIET GUY.

01:48:05.045 --> 01:48:11.151
AND ALCOHOL BEGAN TO BE A VERY

01:48:11.218 --> 01:48:13.820
INTEGRAL PART OF THE WAY HE

01:48:13.887 --> 01:48:15.355
SELF-MEDICATED AND THE FAMILY

01:48:15.422 --> 01:48:16.890
WAS VERY CONCERNED. AND SO THEY

01:48:16.957 --> 01:48:19.626
HAD A FAMILY GATHERING AND

01:48:19.693 --> 01:48:20.160
TALKED ABOUT IT. AND THAT

01:48:20.227 --> 01:48:23.997
EVENING HE ENDED HIS LIFE.

01:48:24.064 --> 01:48:27.267
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT I

01:48:27.334 --> 01:48:29.769
WISH WE HAD ANSWERS FOR, AND

01:48:29.836 --> 01:48:31.571
I'M VERY, VERY THANKFUL THAT WE

01:48:31.638 --> 01:48:33.073
ON THIS ASSEMBLY FLOOR ARE

01:48:33.139 --> 01:48:34.808
ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE. AND I

01:48:34.875 --> 01:48:36.843
THANK YOU FOR ALL THE MEMBERS

01:48:36.910 --> 01:48:40.013
WHO HAVE HAD THIS VERY

01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:42.015
DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCE IN THEIR

01:48:42.082 --> 01:48:42.883
LIFE. BE WILLING TO SHARE,

01:48:42.949 --> 01:48:45.051
BECAUSE THAT TAKES COURAGE AND

01:48:45.118 --> 01:48:46.820
IT TAKES LEADERSHIP, AND IT

01:48:46.887 --> 01:48:50.023
TAKES A LOT OF WHAT WE NEED. SO

01:48:50.090 --> 01:48:52.459
TO THE MEMBER OF SANTA CRUZ,

01:48:52.525 --> 01:48:53.526

POWERFUL WORDS. AND I WOULD

ENCOURAGE US ALL TO SUPPORT

01:48:57.931 --> 01:49:00.767
THIS MEASURE AND TO BE GOOD

01:49:00.834 --> 01:49:02.102

01:49:02.168 --> 01:49:04.905

FAR TOO LONG, CALIFORNIA'S

01:54:59.259 --> 01:55:00.560
NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES HAVE

01:55:00.627 --> 01:55:02.128
FACED UNACCEPTABLE DELAYS IN

01:55:02.195 --> 01:55:03.563
THE REPATRIATION OF THEIR

01:55:03.630 --> 01:55:04.764
ANCESTORS AND CULTURAL ITEMS,

01:55:04.831 --> 01:55:07.000
DESPITE BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE

01:55:07.066 --> 01:55:08.868
LAW. LAWS HAVE NOT BEEN HAVE

01:55:08.935 --> 01:55:10.903
BEEN IN PLACE FOR DECADES, AND

01:55:10.970 --> 01:55:12.038
COMPLIANCE HAS LAGGED,

01:55:12.105 --> 01:55:12.939
TIMELINES HAVE BEEN IGNORED,

01:55:13.006 --> 01:55:15.441
AND OUR INSTITUTIONS HAVE

01:55:15.508 --> 01:55:17.010
FAILED TO TREAT TRIBES AS THE

01:55:17.076 --> 01:55:18.144
EXPERTS AND LEADERS THEY ARE

01:55:18.211 --> 01:55:21.014
FOR 30 PLUS YEARS. THIS IS

01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:23.816
UNACCEPTABLE. I WANT TO THANK

01:55:23.883 --> 01:55:24.917
THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS FROM SAN

01:55:24.984 --> 01:55:26.486

THIS ISSUE AND BRINGING TO THIS

01:55:30.023 --> 01:55:32.825
INJUSTICE TO LIGHT. AB 977

01:55:32.892 --> 01:55:35.028
ENSURES ACCOUNTABILITY. IT

01:55:35.094 --> 01:55:37.096
STRENGTHENS CALIFORNIA'S

01:55:37.163 --> 01:55:38.998
COMPLIANCE AND REQUIRES CLEAR

01:55:39.065 --> 01:55:40.199

AND TRUE CONSULTATION WITH

01:55:42.001 --> 01:55:43.870
TRIBES. TRIBES SHOULD NOT HAVE

01:55:43.936 --> 01:55:45.338
TO BEG OR WAIT ANOTHER 20 YEARS

01:55:45.405 --> 01:55:47.373
FOR THE RETURN OF WHAT IS

01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:48.441
RIGHTFULLY THEIRS. THIS BILL IS

01:55:48.508 --> 01:55:50.043
ABOUT RESPECT. IT IS ABOUT

01:55:50.109 --> 01:55:51.044
JUSTICE, AND IT IS ABOUT MAKING

01:55:51.110 --> 01:55:52.045
SURE THAT OUR STATE

01:55:52.111 --> 01:55:53.880
INSTITUTIONS LIVE UP TO THEIR

01:55:53.946 --> 01:55:55.748
OBLIGATIONS, NOT JUST ON PAPER,

01:55:55.815 --> 01:55:57.283
BUT IN PRACTICE. COLLEAGUES,

01:55:57.350 --> 01:55:58.718
THE TRIBES OF CALIFORNIA HAVE

01:55:58.785 --> 01:55:59.919
WAITED LONG ENOUGH. I

01:55:59.986 --> 01:56:01.120
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE

01:56:01.187 --> 01:56:03.923

RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH,

01:56:09.262 --> 01:56:13.866
MR. SPEAKER. THE FACT THAT WE

01:56:13.933 --> 01:56:15.034
HAVE TO CONTINUE YEAR AFTER

01:56:15.101 --> 01:56:19.172
YEAR, HEARING AFTER HEARING

01:56:19.238 --> 01:56:22.241
BILL AFTER BILL, TO MAKE IT

01:56:22.308 --> 01:56:25.345
CLEAR TO OUR CALIFORNIA

01:56:25.411 --> 01:56:28.081
INSTITUTIONS THAT THESE ARE NOT

01:56:28.147 --> 01:56:30.383
ARTIFACTS, THESE ARE NOT

01:56:30.450 --> 01:56:35.421
PROPERTY. AND THAT IT IS TIME

01:56:35.488 --> 01:56:37.857
TO STOP ALLOWING BUREAUCRACY,

01:56:37.924 --> 01:56:40.827
INSTITUTIONAL PRACTICES TO STOP

01:56:40.893 --> 01:56:47.600
US FROM PROPERLY HONORING THE

01:56:47.667 --> 01:56:48.468
ANCESTORS OF THE FIRST PEOPLE

01:56:48.534 --> 01:56:52.472
OF CALIFORNIA. SO AT SOME POINT,

01:56:52.538 --> 01:56:55.541
I HOPE WE ARE MAKING IT CLEAR

01:56:55.608 --> 01:56:59.879
TO THESE UNIVERSITIES. IT'S

01:56:59.946 --> 01:57:01.781
TIME TO GET THIS DONE, AND

01:57:01.848 --> 01:57:04.117
THERE WILL NEVER BE AN

01:57:04.183 --> 01:57:05.985
ACCEPTABLE EXCUSE OF WHY IT

01:57:06.052 --> 01:57:14.060
CANNOT BE DONE. SO IF WE HAVE

01:57:14.127 --> 01:57:16.896
TO CONTINUE TO BRING THEM IN

01:57:16.963 --> 01:57:18.931
HEARINGS, WHICH I'M SURE THE

01:57:18.998 --> 01:57:20.867
MEMBER FROM SAN BERNARDINO WILL

01:57:20.933 --> 01:57:28.674
CONTINUE TO DO. WE WILL DO SO.

01:57:28.741 --> 01:57:30.943
BUT I'LL TELL YOU THIS, IT IT

01:57:31.010 --> 01:57:32.912
IS HARD TO SUPPORT THE

01:57:32.979 --> 01:57:34.180
INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE DOING

01:57:34.247 --> 01:57:39.786
THIS TO THE FIRST PEOPLE. AND

01:57:39.852 --> 01:57:41.220
BEFORE THEY SEND LETTERS OF

01:57:41.287 --> 01:57:42.922
REQUEST AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS.

01:57:42.989 --> 01:57:44.991
I HOPE THEY HAVE AN ANSWER OF

01:57:45.057 --> 01:57:47.860
WHEN WILL THIS GET DONE?

01:57:47.927 --> 01:57:49.929
BECAUSE TIME IS UP. I

COMMON THEME ABOUT PROTECTING

IS THE FIRST. IT WILL NOT BE

02:32:46.223 --> 02:32:49.093
THE LAST. AND BECAUSE THIS ONE

THE WEIGHT OF AN INDIVIDUAL WHO

02:33:14.451 --> 02:33:16.620

TAKING THEIR CHILD TO GET THE

02:33:19.256 --> 02:33:22.059

02:36:00.617 --> 02:36:01.952

COMMUNITIES SAFE. THIS BILL

02:36:05.723 --> 02:36:07.491
WOULD REQUIRE K-12 SCHOOLS TO

CONFIRMED ON A SCHOOL SITE. IT

02:36:18.335 --> 02:36:20.304

02:36:31.849 --> 02:36:34.184
HERE IS THAT STUDENTS CANNOT

THEIR DOCTOR APPOINTMENTS,

02:41:37.120 --> 02:41:39.289
NEIGHBORS LURED INTO FAKE JOBS,

02:41:39.356 --> 02:41:42.826
ONLY TO BE LOADED INTO VANS AND

02:41:42.893 --> 02:41:46.129
DISAPPEARED. CHILDREN LEFT

02:41:46.196 --> 02:41:47.931

02:41:51.735 --> 02:41:54.571
RINGS, ENTIRE COMMUNITIES

02:41:54.638 --> 02:41:56.106
LIVING UNDER SIEGE, SEALED OFF

02:41:56.173 --> 02:41:59.676
BY ARMORED TRUCKS, PATROLLED BY

02:41:59.743 --> 02:42:00.944
ARMED AGENTS AS IF OUR

02:42:01.011 --> 02:42:04.047
NEIGHBORS WERE ENEMY COMBATANTS.

02:42:04.114 --> 02:42:05.949
THAT, COLLEAGUES, IS NOT LAW

02:42:06.016 --> 02:42:08.085
AND ORDER. THAT IS TERROR. THAT

02:42:08.151 --> 02:42:13.056
IS TRAUMA. THAT IS INJUSTICE.

02:42:13.123 --> 02:42:14.024
CALIFORNIA, THE FOURTH LARGEST

02:42:14.091 --> 02:42:16.660
ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, IS HOME

02:42:16.726 --> 02:42:18.061
TO MORE THAN 10.5 MILLION

02:42:18.128 --> 02:42:21.231
IMMIGRANTS WHO PAY OVER $23

02:42:21.298 --> 02:42:23.467
BILLION IN TAXES EVERY SINGLE

02:42:23.533 --> 02:42:27.170
YEAR. THEY ARE THE REASON NØ WE

02:42:27.237 --> 02:42:29.239
ARE THE REASON WHY CALIFORNIA

02:42:29.306 --> 02:42:32.075
IS THAT BLUE BEACON OF HOPE.

02:42:32.142 --> 02:42:34.111
THEY GROW OUR FOOD, THEY BUILD

02:42:34.177 --> 02:42:36.079
OUR HOMES, THEY TAKE CARE OF

02:42:36.146 --> 02:42:36.880
OUR LOVED ONES, AND THEY

02:42:36.947 --> 02:42:38.982
SUPPORT US IN COUNTLESS WAYS.

02:42:39.049 --> 02:42:40.917
THEY ARE YOUR DOCTORS, OUR

02:42:40.984 --> 02:42:42.953
TEACHERS, OUR LAWYERS. THERE

02:42:43.019 --> 02:42:45.388
ARE MANY OF YOU. THEY ARE YOUR

02:42:45.455 --> 02:42:46.590
FAMILIES. THEY ARE YOUR

02:42:46.656 --> 02:42:48.058
CONSTITUENTS. NEARLY HALF OF

02:42:48.125 --> 02:42:49.259
OUR CHILDREN HAVE AT LEAST ONE

02:42:49.326 --> 02:42:51.394
IMMIGRANT PARENT. THEIR

02:42:51.461 --> 02:42:54.064
LAUGHTER, THEIR FUTURE, THEIR

02:42:54.131 --> 02:42:56.967
PROMISE. THAT IS CALIFORNIA.

02:42:57.033 --> 02:42:58.969
AND YET, DEPORTATIONS AND RAIDS

02:42:59.035 --> 02:43:01.238
DO NOT JUST REMOVE WORKERS FROM

02:43:01.304 --> 02:43:03.306
JOBS OR PARENTS FROM HOMES.

02:43:03.373 --> 02:43:06.042
THEY RIP AWAY DIGNITY. THEY SEW

02:43:06.109 --> 02:43:08.145
TRAUMA. THEY WOUND ENTIRE

02:43:08.211 --> 02:43:09.946
COMMUNITIES FOR GENERATIONS.

02:43:10.013 --> 02:43:11.915
AND LET'S CALL IT LIKE IT IS.

02:43:11.982 --> 02:43:13.817
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TRYING TO

02:43:13.884 --> 02:43:15.118
DEPORT PEOPLE THAT SIMPLY JUST

02:43:15.185 --> 02:43:17.888
LOOK LIKE ME. TARGETING

02:43:17.954 --> 02:43:18.989
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AND

02:43:19.055 --> 02:43:21.091
PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE THOSE OF

02:43:21.158 --> 02:43:23.026
US, EVEN ON THIS FLOOR. AND

02:43:23.093 --> 02:43:25.162
INSTEAD OF ATTACKING THE FABRIC

02:43:25.228 --> 02:43:26.796
OF OUR COMMUNITY, WE SHOULD BE

02:43:26.863 --> 02:43:29.032
EXPANDING THE PATHWAY TO

02:43:29.099 --> 02:43:30.667
CITIZENSHIP. WE SHOULD BE

02:43:30.734 --> 02:43:31.635
EXPANDING EMERGENCY RESPONSE

02:43:31.701 --> 02:43:32.936
RESOURCES TO PROTECT OUR

02:43:33.003 --> 02:43:35.438
WORKERS, OUR CHILDREN, AND OUR

02:43:35.505 --> 02:43:38.074
FAMILIES AFFECTED BY ICE. JUST

02:43:38.141 --> 02:43:39.776
THIS MORNING, A JUDGE RULED

02:43:39.843 --> 02:43:40.977
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S USE OF

02:43:41.044 --> 02:43:42.579
THE NATIONAL GUARD IN LOS

02:43:42.646 --> 02:43:45.048
ANGELES WAS ILLEGAL. HOW MUCH

02:43:45.115 --> 02:43:47.184
MORE PROOF DO WE NEED TO SEE

02:43:47.250 --> 02:43:49.553
THAT THE MAN IN THE WHITE HOUSE

02:43:49.619 --> 02:43:51.121
IS WRONG? COLLEAGUES, SN9 IS

02:43:51.188 --> 02:43:53.290
OUR CALL TO JUSTICE. IT

02:43:53.356 --> 02:43:55.091
CONDEMNS MASS RAIDS. IT

02:43:55.158 --> 02:43:57.160
DENOUNCES THIS ILLEGAL

02:43:57.227 --> 02:43:58.061
MILITARIZATION. AND IT DECLARES

02:43:58.128 --> 02:44:00.430
THAT IN CALIFORNIA, REGARDLESS

02:44:00.497 --> 02:44:01.932

DURAZO. RIGHT NOW IN LOS

02:44:24.287 --> 02:44:26.423
ANGELES, FAMILIES LIVE IN

02:44:26.489 --> 02:44:29.893
CONSTANT FEAR. CHILDREN CLING

02:44:29.960 --> 02:44:31.228
TO THEIR PARENTS, UNSURE IF

02:44:31.294 --> 02:44:34.331
THEY WILL SEE TOMORROW. WORKERS

02:44:34.397 --> 02:44:36.633
ARE DRAGGED FROM THEIR JOB

02:44:36.700 --> 02:44:40.036
SITES. VENDORS TACKLED TO THE

02:44:40.103 --> 02:44:42.772
STREETS, AND EVEN US CITIZENS

02:44:42.839 --> 02:44:45.308
LIKE 20 YEAR OLD ADRIAN

02:44:45.375 --> 02:44:47.110
MARTINEZ ARE VIOLENTLY DETAINED.

02:44:47.177 --> 02:44:50.447
HIS ONLY CRIME WAS PROTECTING

02:44:50.513 --> 02:44:54.150
AN ELDERLY JANITOR. MR. SPEAKER,

02:44:54.217 --> 02:44:56.486
THIS IS NOT PUBLIC SAFETY. THIS

02:44:56.553 --> 02:44:59.122
IS NOT JUSTICE. THIS IS FEAR.

02:44:59.189 --> 02:45:01.891
THIS IS CRUELTY. THIS IS

02:45:01.958 --> 02:45:04.728
TEARING OUR FAMILIES APART. IT

02:45:04.794 --> 02:45:06.997
IS TRAUMATIZING OUR CHILDREN

02:45:07.063 --> 02:45:09.899
AND WEAKENING OUR COMMUNITIES.

02:45:09.966 --> 02:45:12.202
IMMIGRANTS ARE NOT OUTSIDERS.

02:45:12.269 --> 02:45:14.404
THEY ARE OUR NEIGHBORS. THEY

02:45:14.471 --> 02:45:18.408
ARE 10.5 MILLION CALIFORNIANS

02:45:18.475 --> 02:45:22.212
WHO CONTRIBUTE $23 BILLION IN

02:45:22.279 --> 02:45:24.114
TAXES TO KEEP OUR ECONOMY

02:45:24.180 --> 02:45:26.349
STRONG. DEPORTING THEM DOESN'T

02:45:26.416 --> 02:45:30.654
JUST BREAK FAMILIES. IT BREAKS

02:45:30.720 --> 02:45:32.922
CALIFORNIA. COR NINE IS MORE

02:45:32.989 --> 02:45:34.557
THAN POLICY. IT IS ABOUT

02:45:34.624 --> 02:45:37.260
STANDING UP FOR DIGNITY AND

02:45:37.327 --> 02:45:37.961
COMPASSION AND THE VALUES WE

02:45:38.028 --> 02:45:40.897
CLAIM AS CALIFORNIANS. I URGE

02:45:40.964 --> 02:45:44.067
YOU TO VOTE AYE. THANK YOU,

02:45:44.134 --> 02:45:46.269
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. ARENS.

02:45:46.336 --> 02:45:47.270
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. TAMAYO, YOU

02:45:47.337 --> 02:45:52.375
ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MR.

02:45:52.442 --> 02:45:52.909
SPEAKER. I REFRAINED FROM

02:45:52.976 --> 02:45:54.911
SPEAKING ON THE PRIOR TWO BILLS

02:45:54.978 --> 02:45:56.146
BECAUSE I KNEW THAT WE WOULD

02:45:56.212 --> 02:45:58.114
GET TO THIS ONE. THEY'RE ALL

02:45:58.181 --> 02:46:00.116
PART OF THE SAME PACKAGE, BUT

02:46:00.183 --> 02:46:02.352
THE SAME SET OF FEAR MONGERING

02:46:02.419 --> 02:46:03.887
AND FALSEHOODS BEING PEDDLED BY

02:46:03.953 --> 02:46:07.590
POLITICIANS. THIS IS JUST

02:46:07.657 --> 02:46:09.926
DISGRACEFUL, BECAUSE THERE IS A

02:46:09.993 --> 02:46:12.662
70% CONSENSUS IN THE STATE OF

02:46:12.729 --> 02:46:14.731
CALIFORNIA ON THE ISSUE OF

02:46:14.798 --> 02:46:16.433
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, ON THE

02:46:16.499 --> 02:46:19.636
ISSUE OF LEGAL IMMIGRATION,

02:46:19.703 --> 02:46:22.238
THAT 70% CONSENSUS. YOU DON'T

02:46:22.305 --> 02:46:24.240
WANT THE MEDIA TO REPORT IT.

02:46:24.307 --> 02:46:25.942
YOU DON'T WANT THE PEOPLE TO

02:46:26.009 --> 02:46:29.012
REALIZE IT. BUT THAT'S 70%

02:46:29.079 --> 02:46:32.215
CONSENSUS IS BUILT ON TEN

02:46:32.282 --> 02:46:35.618
GENERATIONS OF HERITAGE IN THIS

02:46:35.685 --> 02:46:39.723
COUNTRY OF WELCOMING IMMIGRANTS

02:46:39.789 --> 02:46:42.092
WITH OPEN ARMS. AND I STAND

02:46:42.158 --> 02:46:44.294
BEFORE YOU TODAY ON BEHALF OF

02:46:44.361 --> 02:46:46.196
THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS IN THIS

02:46:46.262 --> 02:46:49.899
CHAMBER, TO SAY THAT WE WELCOME

02:46:49.966 --> 02:46:51.167
IMMIGRANTS WITH OPEN ARMS. WE

02:46:51.234 --> 02:46:53.370
STAND WITH THE 70% OF

02:46:53.436 --> 02:46:54.070
CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE

02:46:54.137 --> 02:46:56.172
FUNDAMENTALLY FAIR. THEY

02:46:56.239 --> 02:46:58.007
BELIEVE IN GIVING PEOPLE AN

02:46:58.074 --> 02:47:01.411
OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY BY THE

02:47:01.478 --> 02:47:02.212
RULES, TO WORK HARD AND TO

02:47:02.278 --> 02:47:04.013
ACHIEVE THE AMERICAN DREAM,

02:47:04.080 --> 02:47:05.281
JUST AS WE'VE PROVIDED THAT

02:47:05.348 --> 02:47:07.083
OPPORTUNITY TO TEN GENERATIONS

02:47:07.150 --> 02:47:10.120
IN THIS COUNTRY, I BELIEVE WE

02:47:10.186 --> 02:47:12.322
SHOULD BE MAKING AMERICA GREAT.

02:47:12.389 --> 02:47:12.956
I KNOW THAT THOSE ARE

02:47:13.022 --> 02:47:14.791
TRIGGERING WORDS FOR SOME IN

02:47:14.858 --> 02:47:16.292
THIS ROOM, BUT I BELIEVE THAT

02:47:16.359 --> 02:47:18.128
IN ORDER FOR US TO KEEP AMERICA

02:47:18.194 --> 02:47:21.131
GREAT, WE MUST BE A WELCOMING

02:47:21.197 --> 02:47:23.133
COUNTRY TO OUR IMMIGRANTS. ALL

02:47:23.199 --> 02:47:25.335
WE'RE ASKING FOR, ALL THE

02:47:25.402 --> 02:47:26.469
AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE ASKING FOR

02:47:26.536 --> 02:47:28.438
ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE ASKING FOR

02:47:28.505 --> 02:47:31.541
THE 70% IS THAT FIRST WE HAVE A

02:47:31.608 --> 02:47:33.309
SECURE BORDER. SECOND, THAT

02:47:33.376 --> 02:47:35.011
WHEN PEOPLE COME INTO THIS

02:47:35.078 --> 02:47:37.180
COUNTRY, WE VET THEM, THAT

02:47:37.247 --> 02:47:39.082
THERE'S A PROCESS, THAT THEY

02:47:39.149 --> 02:47:41.284
FOLLOW THE RULES. THIRD, THAT

02:47:41.351 --> 02:47:44.654
WHEN THEY'RE HERE, THEY BUILD

02:47:44.721 --> 02:47:46.189
ON THOSE TEN GENERATIONS OF

02:47:46.256 --> 02:47:47.290
IMMIGRANTS WHO SAY, WE'RE NOT

02:47:47.357 --> 02:47:48.324
HERE FOR THE HANDOUT, WE'RE

02:47:48.391 --> 02:47:50.026
HERE JUST FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.

02:47:50.093 --> 02:47:51.795
JUST GIVE US A CHANCE. WE'LL

02:47:51.861 --> 02:47:54.364
WORK HARD, PLAY BY THE RULES.

02:47:54.431 --> 02:47:56.933
THAT IMMIGRATION SYSTEM CAN BE

02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:00.270
BUILT, BUT IT CANNOT BE BUILT

02:48:00.336 --> 02:48:02.005
WITH THE FEAR MONGERING AND THE

02:48:02.071 --> 02:48:04.340
FALSEHOODS THAT WE ARE HEARING

02:48:04.407 --> 02:48:05.508
ON THE RESOLUTIONS THAT YOU'RE

02:48:05.575 --> 02:48:08.077
OFFERING TODAY. YOU DON'T EVEN

02:48:08.144 --> 02:48:11.181
WANT AN HONEST DEBATE. IT'S

02:48:11.247 --> 02:48:13.082
PROOF I OFFERED AN AMENDMENT ON

02:48:13.149 --> 02:48:17.320
THIS BILL TO REPEAL SB 54,

02:48:17.387 --> 02:48:18.855
WHICH IS THE ROOT CAUSE OF

02:48:18.922 --> 02:48:20.089
THESE SO-CALLED IMMIGRATION

02:48:20.156 --> 02:48:21.858
RAIDS, ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION

02:48:21.925 --> 02:48:23.126
RAIDS IN THE STATE OF

02:48:23.193 --> 02:48:23.860
CALIFORNIA THAT YOU'RE MAKING

02:48:23.927 --> 02:48:27.931
SUCH HAY OVER SB 54 BROUGHT US

02:48:27.997 --> 02:48:31.434
TO THIS POINT BECAUSE IN 2017,

02:48:31.501 --> 02:48:35.038
THIS CHAMBER, YOUR MAJORITY

02:48:35.104 --> 02:48:37.841
VIEWPOINT SAID, LOOK, WE SHOULD

02:48:37.907 --> 02:48:39.442
NOT BE WORKING WITH ICE. WE

02:48:39.509 --> 02:48:40.977
SHOULDN'T BE COORDINATING WITH

02:48:41.044 --> 02:48:42.078
FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. IF YOU

02:48:42.145 --> 02:48:44.447
WANT TO GO DETAIN CRIMINALS,

02:48:44.514 --> 02:48:45.849
WE'RE NOT GOING TO HELP YOU.

02:48:45.915 --> 02:48:48.418
YOU CAN'T GET A DETAINER. YOU

02:48:48.485 --> 02:48:49.953
CAN'T HAVE A HANDOFF IN A JAIL

02:48:50.019 --> 02:48:52.055
FOR A VIOLENT CRIMINAL. NO, NO.

02:48:52.121 --> 02:48:53.923
YOU GO OUT ON THE STREET AND

02:48:53.990 --> 02:48:55.925
YOU FIND THEM. WE'RE NOT GOING

02:48:55.992 --> 02:48:57.160
TO INTERFERE WITH THE FEDERAL

02:48:57.227 --> 02:48:58.561
GOVERNMENT. WE'RE JUST NOT

02:48:58.628 --> 02:48:59.929
GOING TO HELP. THOSE WERE THE

02:48:59.996 --> 02:49:02.832
CLAIMS THAT YOU MADE FOR SB 54.

02:49:02.899 --> 02:49:05.935
MY, HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED.

02:49:06.002 --> 02:49:07.837
NOW, WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS, NO,

02:49:07.904 --> 02:49:09.072
NO, WE'RE NOT GOING TO

02:49:09.138 --> 02:49:10.139
COORDINATE WITH FEDERAL LAW

02:49:10.206 --> 02:49:11.541

02:49:13.543 --> 02:49:15.512
IMPEDE WE'RE GOING TO USE FEAR

02:49:15.578 --> 02:49:16.880
MONGERING. WE'RE GOING TO USE

02:49:16.946 --> 02:49:19.082
HATE FILLED RHETORIC TO TRY TO

02:49:19.148 --> 02:49:22.151
GET THE PUBLIC AGITATED, TO

02:49:22.218 --> 02:49:23.987
ACTUALLY, PERHAPS PHYSICALLY

02:49:24.053 --> 02:49:25.288
CONFRONT FEDERAL LAW

02:49:25.355 --> 02:49:26.890
ENFORCEMENT AGENTS, PUTTING

02:49:26.956 --> 02:49:29.392
PUBLIC SAFETY AT RISK. IT'S

02:49:29.459 --> 02:49:31.794
SHAMEFUL. IF YOU WANTED A MORE

02:49:31.861 --> 02:49:33.263
ORDERLY PROCESS FOR THE

02:49:33.329 --> 02:49:34.230
ENFORCEMENT OF FEDERAL

02:49:34.297 --> 02:49:35.832

02:49:35.899 --> 02:49:37.100
BACK DOWN FROM YOUR UTTER

02:49:37.166 --> 02:49:39.369
FAILURE OF SB 54, WHICH PUTS

02:49:39.435 --> 02:49:43.139
OUR COMMUNITY'S SAFETY AT RISK,

02:49:43.206 --> 02:49:45.008
NOT JUST BY THE PEOPLE THAT

02:49:45.074 --> 02:49:46.342
HAVE BEEN RELEASED ONTO THE

02:49:46.409 --> 02:49:47.443

WHO ARE VIOLENT AND

02:49:49.279 --> 02:49:49.979
RECOMMITTING CRIMES WITH YOUR

02:49:50.046 --> 02:49:53.449
AID. BUT IT IMPEDES FEDERAL LAW

02:49:53.516 --> 02:49:55.985
ENFORCEMENT IN THEIR DUTIES.

02:49:56.052 --> 02:49:57.620

SERVE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES

02:50:02.892 --> 02:50:04.160
WHEN YOU STRIP THEM OF THE

02:50:04.227 --> 02:50:05.995
ABILITY TO HAVE A CHARTER

02:50:06.062 --> 02:50:08.598

WHEN YOU MAKE THEIR COST OF

02:50:13.069 --> 02:50:15.371
LIVING MORE EXPENSIVE THROUGH

02:50:15.438 --> 02:50:17.273
REGRESSIVE TAX INCREASES LIKE

02:50:17.340 --> 02:50:20.476
THE GAS TAX INCREASE OR UTILITY

02:50:25.481 --> 02:50:27.317
OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES ARE

02:50:27.383 --> 02:50:29.819

02:54:14.177 --> 02:54:16.212
SERVE IN THIS BODY AS SOMEONE

02:54:16.279 --> 02:54:19.715
SHAPED BY THEIR RESILIENCE. AND

02:54:19.782 --> 02:54:23.452
YET, MY PARENTS, WHO ARE THE

02:54:23.519 --> 02:54:24.187
EMBODIMENT OF THE AMERICAN

02:54:24.253 --> 02:54:26.189
DREAM, NO LONGER FEEL SAFE

02:54:26.255 --> 02:54:29.158
LEAVING THEIR HOME BECAUSE OF

02:54:29.225 --> 02:54:33.796
HOW THEY LOOK MEXICAN. THEY

02:54:33.863 --> 02:54:36.232
HAVE BEEN CITIZENS FOR ALMOST

02:54:36.299 --> 02:54:38.868
30 YEARS. AND YES, BECAUSE OF

02:54:38.935 --> 02:54:41.370
THE WAY THEY LOOK AND SPEAK,

02:54:41.437 --> 02:54:42.638
THEY FEAR THEY WILL BE TARGETED.

02:54:42.705 --> 02:54:44.140
IN FACT, ON THE RARE OCCASION

02:54:44.207 --> 02:54:46.008
THAT THEY LEAVE THEIR HOME,

02:54:46.075 --> 02:54:47.677
THEY NOW CARRY BOTH THEIR

02:54:47.743 --> 02:54:49.378
NATURALIZATION CERTIFICATE AND

02:54:49.445 --> 02:54:52.148
THEIR PASSPORT WITH THEM AT ALL

02:54:52.215 --> 02:54:54.550
TIMES AS A PRECAUTIONARY

02:54:54.617 --> 02:54:56.853
MEASURE. THIS IS NOT FEAR

02:54:56.919 --> 02:54:58.955
MONGERING. THIS IS THEIR TRUTH.

02:54:59.021 --> 02:55:01.324
THIS CONSTANT STATE OF LIVING

02:55:01.390 --> 02:55:03.059
IN FEAR IS NOT SOMETHING UNIQUE

02:55:03.125 --> 02:55:05.228

IMMIGRANT MYSELF AND AS VICE

02:58:10.413 --> 02:58:13.449
CHAIR OF THE LATINO CAUCUS.

02:58:13.516 --> 02:58:14.950
THERE IS A REAL FEAR IN OUR

02:58:15.017 --> 02:58:16.218
STATE AND THROUGHOUT OUR

02:58:16.285 --> 02:58:18.621

WORKERS, GRANDPARENTS AND YOUNG

02:58:21.190 --> 02:58:22.291
PEOPLE ARE SCARED TO GO ABOUT

02:58:22.358 --> 02:58:24.093
THEIR DAILY LIVES AS A RESULT

02:58:24.160 --> 02:58:26.028
OF THE MASS IMMIGRATION RAIDS

02:58:26.095 --> 02:58:27.396
BEING CARRIED OUT BY THE

02:58:27.463 --> 02:58:30.066
FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION. AS AN

02:58:30.132 --> 02:58:32.268
IMMIGRANT MYSELF, THAT CAME TO

02:58:32.334 --> 02:58:33.969
THIS COUNTRY AT A YOUNG AGE AND

02:58:34.036 --> 02:58:35.337
HAS WORKED TREMENDOUSLY HARD TO

02:58:35.404 --> 02:58:36.939
AFFORD A BETTER LIFE, NOT JUST

02:58:37.006 --> 02:58:39.475
FOR MYSELF, BUT FOR MY FAMILY,

02:58:39.542 --> 02:58:42.011
I KNOW FIRSTHAND THE VALUE WE

02:58:42.078 --> 02:58:45.047
BRING TO THIS STATE AND COUNTRY.

02:58:45.114 --> 02:58:46.816
THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY PLAYS A

02:58:46.882 --> 02:58:48.751
CRUCIAL ROLE IN OUR STATE'S

02:58:48.818 --> 02:58:51.020
ECONOMY, YET WE KNOW MANY OF

02:58:51.087 --> 02:58:53.289
THEM IN THIS MOMENT ARE UNABLE

02:58:53.355 --> 02:58:55.024
TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES BECAUSE OF

02:58:55.091 --> 02:58:57.126
THE FEAR OF DEPORTATION. SINCE

02:58:57.193 --> 02:58:59.261
EARLY JUNE, THE STREETS OF LOS

02:58:59.328 --> 02:59:02.364
ANGELES HAVE BECOME WITNESS TO

02:59:02.431 --> 02:59:03.833
FREQUENT MILITARY-STYLE

02:59:03.899 --> 02:59:05.367
IMMIGRATION RAIDS THAT HAVE

02:59:05.434 --> 02:59:07.436
SEEN PEOPLE SUSPECTED OF BEING

02:59:07.503 --> 02:59:09.572
UNDOCUMENTED MIGRANTS DETAINED.

02:59:09.638 --> 02:59:12.842
SOME HAVE BEEN RAPIDLY DEPORTED.

02:59:12.908 --> 02:59:15.077
THIS IS IN LAW AND ORDER. IT'S

02:59:15.144 --> 02:59:17.513
FEAR AND CHAOS MEANT TO DIVIDE

02:59:17.580 --> 02:59:20.116

THE MASS IMMIGRATION RAIDS

02:59:22.251 --> 02:59:23.919
TARGETING WORKERS AND FAMILIES

02:59:23.986 --> 02:59:26.088

PROTECTION OF CIVIL LIBERTIES

02:59:27.056 --> 02:59:30.159
AND HUMAN DIGNITY, RATHER THAN

02:59:30.226 --> 02:59:31.193
RESTORING ORDER. THIS

02:59:31.260 --> 02:59:33.295
ADMINISTRATION IS MILITARY

02:59:33.362 --> 02:59:35.364
PRESENCE TO ESCALATE TENSIONS,

02:59:35.431 --> 02:59:36.532
RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT THE

02:59:36.599 --> 02:59:39.435
POTENTIAL FOR FURTHER VIOLENCE.

02:59:39.502 --> 02:59:41.504
THIS CONTINUED ACTIONS DO NOT

02:59:41.570 --> 02:59:43.339
MAKE US SAFER. THEY INSTILL

02:59:43.405 --> 02:59:47.009
FEAR, TEAR FAMILIES APART, AND

02:59:47.076 --> 02:59:48.677
FORCE PEOPLE FURTHER INTO THE

02:59:48.744 --> 02:59:50.779

03:00:02.258 --> 03:00:03.692

IMMIGRATION RAIDS AND

03:00:14.970 --> 03:00:17.206
DEPORTATIONS WILL COST

03:00:17.273 --> 03:00:19.408
CALIFORNIA A STAGGERING 275

03:00:19.475 --> 03:00:22.978
BILLION IN GDP. IMMIGRANTS IN

THE CONTRIBUTION OF IMMIGRANTS

03:00:30.052 --> 03:00:32.054

PALMDALE AND OTHER AREAS FOR

03:01:04.119 --> 03:01:05.888
REALLY TALKING ABOUT THE

03:01:05.955 --> 03:01:08.157
EXTREME CRUELTY THAT THESE ICE

03:01:08.224 --> 03:01:10.092
RAIDS HAVE HAD ON THE PEOPLE OF

03:01:10.159 --> 03:01:12.261
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA,

03:01:12.328 --> 03:01:14.730
RIPPING FAMILIES APART, RAIDING

03:01:14.797 --> 03:01:18.601
SCHOOLS AND WORKPLACES, PICKING

03:01:18.667 --> 03:01:19.935

DOMESTIC WORKERS OFF THE STREET

03:01:21.870 --> 03:01:24.974
AND DISAPPEARING THEM. IT'S A

03:01:25.040 --> 03:01:26.875
CRUELTY THAT'S UNIMAGINED. AND

03:01:26.942 --> 03:01:28.978
I NEVER THOUGHT THAT WE WOULD

03:01:29.044 --> 03:01:31.247
SEE IN THE UNITED STATES THAT I

03:01:31.313 --> 03:01:32.982
LOVE SO MUCH. BUT I WANT TO

03:01:33.048 --> 03:01:34.183
SPEND ANOTHER MINUTE TALKING

03:01:34.250 --> 03:01:37.886
ABOUT THE EXTREME ECONOMIC HARM

03:01:37.953 --> 03:01:40.322
THAT THE ICE RAIDS HAVE HAD ON

03:01:40.389 --> 03:01:42.091
CALIFORNIA WORKERS, BUSINESSES

03:01:42.157 --> 03:01:45.494

03:01:45.561 --> 03:01:47.396
PRIVATE SECTOR WORKFORCE HAS

03:01:47.463 --> 03:01:50.199
ALREADY SHRUNK BY 3% SINCE THE

03:01:50.266 --> 03:01:52.101
ICE RAIDS BEGAN IN JUNE, AND

03:01:52.167 --> 03:01:54.403
THAT'S ACCORDING TO A STANFORD

03:01:54.470 --> 03:01:56.038
UNIVERSITY STUDY. ANOTHER

03:01:56.105 --> 03:01:58.407
RECENT STUDY SHOWS THAT

03:01:58.474 --> 03:01:59.975
UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS CONTRIBUTE

03:02:00.042 --> 03:02:03.445
5% OF CALIFORNIA'S GDP, 5%.

03:02:03.512 --> 03:02:05.914
THIS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS

03:02:05.981 --> 03:02:07.082
CRITICAL INDUSTRIES SUCH AS

03:02:07.149 --> 03:02:08.384
AGRICULTURE AND CONSTRUCTION

03:02:08.450 --> 03:02:11.553
AND HOSPITALITY. AND THESE

03:02:11.620 --> 03:02:12.721
FOLKS THAT THE TRUMP

03:02:12.788 --> 03:02:14.590
ADMINISTRATION IS TARGETING ARE

03:02:14.657 --> 03:02:17.926
CONTRIBUTING TO OUR COMMUNITY.

03:02:17.993 --> 03:02:19.728
CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANTS PAY MORE

03:02:19.795 --> 03:02:21.297
THAN $81 BILLION IN FEDERAL

03:02:21.363 --> 03:02:23.098
TAXES EACH YEAR, AND IN

03:02:23.165 --> 03:02:25.901
ADDITION, 51 MORE THAN $51

03:02:25.968 --> 03:02:28.270
BILLION IN STATE AND LOCAL

03:02:28.337 --> 03:02:32.508
TAXES. 88% OF FARM WORKERS IN

03:02:32.574 --> 03:02:33.509
CALIFORNIA ARE IMMIGRANTS.

03:02:33.575 --> 03:02:36.979
THAT'S 880,000 PEOPLE. AND

03:02:37.046 --> 03:02:38.614
APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THOSE ARE

03:02:38.681 --> 03:02:40.883
UNDOCUMENTED. AGRICULTURE

03:02:40.949 --> 03:02:44.086
GENERATES ALMOST $60 BILLION

03:02:44.153 --> 03:02:46.221
ANNUALLY, AND THIS ACCOUNTS FOR

03:02:46.288 --> 03:02:48.257
MORE THAN ONE THIRD OF ALL

03:02:48.324 --> 03:02:49.058
VEGETABLES PRODUCED IN THE

03:02:49.124 --> 03:02:51.860
ENTIRE UNITED STATES. AND THREE

03:02:51.927 --> 03:02:53.929
QUARTERS OF OUR FRUITS AND NUTS

03:02:53.996 --> 03:02:56.198
IN THE TOURISM AND HOSPITALITY

03:02:56.265 --> 03:02:57.866
INDUSTRY, WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT

03:02:57.933 --> 03:03:01.403
IN MY DISTRICT. THIS IS $150

03:03:01.470 --> 03:03:03.038
BILLION INDUSTRY THAT RELIES ON

03:03:03.105 --> 03:03:05.240
OUR IMMIGRANT WORKFORCE.

03:03:05.307 --> 03:03:07.009
IMMIGRANTS HOLD ONE THIRD OF

03:03:07.076 --> 03:03:08.243
ALL TOURISM AND HOSPITALITY

03:03:08.310 --> 03:03:10.412
JOBS, AND THIS HAS HAD A

03:03:10.479 --> 03:03:11.880
DEVASTATING IMPACT ON

03:03:11.947 --> 03:03:14.116
CALIFORNIA'S HOSPITALITY AND

03:03:14.183 --> 03:03:17.720
TOURISM BUSINESS. AND OF COURSE,

03:03:17.786 --> 03:03:18.654
CALIFORNIA CONSTRUCTION

03:03:18.721 --> 03:03:20.989
IMMIGRANTS MAKE UP 41% OF OF

03:03:21.056 --> 03:03:23.459
THE CONSTRUCTION WORKFORCE,

03:03:23.525 --> 03:03:26.228
WHICH CONTRIBUTED $158 BILLION

03:03:26.295 --> 03:03:30.332
TO CALIFORNIA'S GDP. HOME AND

03:03:30.399 --> 03:03:33.302
HEALTHCARE WORKERS I HAVE

03:03:33.369 --> 03:03:35.104
PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY WITH

03:03:35.170 --> 03:03:38.107
THE THE TWO WOMEN WHO BECAME

03:03:38.173 --> 03:03:40.008
PART OF MY FAMILY AND TOOK CARE

03:03:40.075 --> 03:03:42.911
OF MY MOM. THEY ARE AFRAID TO

03:03:42.978 --> 03:03:45.047
COME OUT OF THEIR HOUSE. THEY

03:03:45.114 --> 03:03:48.217
HAVE NOT WORKED FOR MONTHS.

03:03:48.283 --> 03:03:50.085
THESE ARE FOLKS THAT ARE THE

03:03:50.152 --> 03:03:53.255
MOST CARING, LOVING,

03:03:53.322 --> 03:03:55.624
HARDWORKING PEOPLE I'VE EVER

03:03:55.691 --> 03:04:00.129
MET. AND YOU KNOW, WHAT IS

03:04:00.195 --> 03:04:03.265
HAPPENING TO FOLKS IS AFFECTING

03:04:03.332 --> 03:04:06.502
FOLKS THAT WE RELY ON IN OUR IN

03:04:06.568 --> 03:04:08.437
OUR COMMUNITIES TO TAKE CARE OF

03:04:08.504 --> 03:04:11.240
OUR LOVED ONES. AND REALLY, YOU

03:04:11.306 --> 03:04:14.009
KNOW, OUR PARTS OF OUR FAMILIES.

03:04:14.076 --> 03:04:17.079
SO, IN CLOSING, YOU KNOW, THIS

03:04:17.146 --> 03:04:19.214
HAS HAD A DEVASTATING IMPACT ON

03:04:19.281 --> 03:04:21.250
COMMUNITIES, ON FAMILIES

03:04:21.316 --> 03:04:23.285
STRIKING FEAR INTO THE HEARTS

03:04:23.352 --> 03:04:26.021
OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE. BUT

03:04:26.088 --> 03:04:27.389
IT'S ALSO HAD A HORRIBLE EFFECT

03:04:27.456 --> 03:04:30.359
ON OUR ECONOMY. AND WE'RE

03:04:30.426 --> 03:04:32.161
SEEING THAT ALREADY. AND THE

03:04:32.227 --> 03:04:33.962
MORE THAT THIS GOES ON, WE'RE

03:04:34.029 --> 03:04:35.097
GOING TO CONTINUE SEEING THIS

03:04:35.164 --> 03:04:37.599
IN IN SPADES AS, AS AS THIS

03:04:37.666 --> 03:04:39.134
MOVES FORWARD. SO WITH THAT, I

03:04:39.201 --> 03:04:41.403
WANT TO THANK SENATOR BARRASSO.

03:04:41.470 --> 03:04:43.172
I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE

03:04:43.238 --> 03:04:45.274
FROM LOS ANGELES AND OTHER

03:04:45.340 --> 03:04:47.876
PARTS OF THE STATE FOR BRINGING

03:04:47.943 --> 03:04:50.879
HOME HOW HORRIBLY CRUEL THESE

03:04:50.946 --> 03:04:53.182
THESE ICE RAIDS ARE AND THE

03:04:53.248 --> 03:04:53.982
FEDERAL POLICY IS. AND WITH

03:04:54.049 --> 03:04:56.051
THAT, I STRONGLY ASK FOR AN AYE

03:04:56.118 --> 03:04:58.821
VOTE ON COR NINE. THANK YOU,

03:04:58.887 --> 03:05:00.489
ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. BOR ASSEMBLY

03:05:00.556 --> 03:05:01.089

03:05:06.662 --> 03:05:08.230

03:05:08.297 --> 03:05:10.065
JEWISH CAUCUS IN STRONG SUPPORT

03:05:10.132 --> 03:05:12.935
OF C NINE, A RESOLUTION THAT

03:05:13.001 --> 03:05:15.404
CONDEMNS THE CRUEL AND

03:05:15.471 --> 03:05:16.472
INDISCRIMINATE IMMIGRATION

03:05:16.538 --> 03:05:17.739
RAIDS UNFOLDING IN OUR STATE.

03:05:17.806 --> 03:05:20.075
AND I WOULD SAY THAT JEWISH

03:05:20.142 --> 03:05:21.944
COMMUNITIES KNOW ALL TOO WELL

03:05:22.010 --> 03:05:25.047
HOW THIS CAN GET CAN END UP.

03:05:25.113 --> 03:05:26.281
WHAT WE'VE WITNESSED OVER THE

03:05:26.348 --> 03:05:29.017
PAST MONTHS IS NOT ENFORCEMENT,

03:05:29.084 --> 03:05:30.752
IT'S TRAUMA. AND YOU'VE HEARD

03:05:30.819 --> 03:05:33.355
MANY OF THE PARTICULAR STORIES

03:05:33.422 --> 03:05:34.823
OF THAT TRAUMA FROM

03:05:34.890 --> 03:05:35.924
REPRESENTATIVES FROM

03:05:35.991 --> 03:05:38.060
COMMUNITIES ALL OVER CALIFORNIA

03:05:38.126 --> 03:05:39.895
TODAY. AND I WOULD JUST SAY TO

03:05:39.962 --> 03:05:41.196
OUR COLLEAGUES AND TO ALL THOSE

03:05:41.263 --> 03:05:42.764
THAT ARE EXPERIENCING THESE

03:05:42.831 --> 03:05:46.034
TRAUMAS THAT I, FOR ONE,

03:05:46.101 --> 03:05:47.402
BELIEVE YOU AND THAT MANY IN

THE JEWISH COMMUNITY AND

03:05:49.004 --> 03:05:49.938
CERTAINLY THE CALIFORNIA

LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS

03:05:51.573 --> 03:05:53.876
BELIEVES YOU. AND WE KNOW THAT

03:05:53.942 --> 03:05:56.345
THIS IS NOT ABOUT FEARMONGERING.

03:05:56.411 --> 03:05:57.346
IT'S JUST ABOUT PEOPLE'S

03:05:57.412 --> 03:05:59.915
EVERYDAY REAL LIFE EXPERIENCES

03:05:59.982 --> 03:06:02.150
AND THE PEOPLE THAT WE'VE SWORN

03:06:02.217 --> 03:06:03.986
TO COME UP HERE AND SERVE. AND

03:06:04.052 --> 03:06:05.354
WE KNOW THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING

03:06:05.420 --> 03:06:06.955
IS FAMILIES ARE TORN APART IN

03:06:07.022 --> 03:06:09.558
THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING,

03:06:09.625 --> 03:06:11.159
THAT CHILDREN HAVE BEEN LEFT

03:06:11.226 --> 03:06:12.127
WONDERING IF THEIR PARENTS WILL

03:06:12.194 --> 03:06:15.464
COME HOME, AND THAT ENTIRE

03:06:15.531 --> 03:06:16.198
NEIGHBORHOODS TRULY ARE LIVING

03:06:16.265 --> 03:06:19.368
IN FEAR. WE KNOW THAT THESE ARE

03:06:19.434 --> 03:06:20.936
NOT ISOLATED INCIDENTS, THAT

03:06:21.003 --> 03:06:23.372
MILITARIZED OPERATIONS, THAT

03:06:23.438 --> 03:06:24.172
ARE TARGETING WORKERS AND

03:06:24.239 --> 03:06:26.375
PARENTS AND STUDENTS, WITHOUT

03:06:26.441 --> 03:06:28.277
WARNING, ARE OFTEN HAPPENING

03:06:28.343 --> 03:06:31.380
WITHOUT CAUSE AND WITHOUT DUE

03:06:31.446 --> 03:06:33.081
PROCESS. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT

03:06:33.148 --> 03:06:33.882
CALIFORNIA'S IMMIGRANT

03:06:33.949 --> 03:06:36.184
COMMUNITIES ARE NOT STRANGERS.

03:06:36.251 --> 03:06:37.920
IT'S OUR NEIGHBORS, AS YOU'VE

03:06:37.986 --> 03:06:40.055
HEARD, ESSENTIAL WORKERS, BUT

03:06:40.122 --> 03:06:41.490
PEOPLE WHO ARE ALSO

03:06:41.557 --> 03:06:42.758
FOUNDATIONAL TO OUR COMMUNITIES,

03:06:42.824 --> 03:06:47.663
OUR CULTURE, OUR SHARED FUTURE,

03:06:47.729 --> 03:06:48.230
AND OUR CURRENT AND SHARED

03:06:48.297 --> 03:06:50.232
PROSPERITY. AND AS I MENTIONED,

03:06:50.299 --> 03:06:52.034
JEWISH PEOPLE KNOW DEEPLY AND

03:06:52.100 --> 03:06:53.135
GENERATIONALLY WHAT HAPPENS

03:06:53.201 --> 03:06:55.704
WHEN COMMUNITIES ARE TARGETED,

03:06:55.771 --> 03:06:56.305
WHEN THEY'RE SCAPEGOATED, AND

03:06:56.371 --> 03:06:57.906
WHEN THEY'RE TREATED AS

03:06:57.973 --> 03:06:59.174
DISPOSABLE, AND WHEN THEY'RE

03:06:59.241 --> 03:07:01.243
TOLD IN PARTICULAR, THAT WHAT

03:07:01.310 --> 03:07:03.612
YOU'RE SEEING AND FEELING IS

03:07:03.679 --> 03:07:05.180
NOT REAL, THAT SOMEBODY IS

03:07:05.247 --> 03:07:06.081
MAKING THAT UP, THAT YOU'RE

03:07:06.148 --> 03:07:08.116
MAKING THAT UP, THAT IT

03:07:08.183 --> 03:07:09.318
COULDN'T BE TRUE. AND WHAT I

03:07:09.384 --> 03:07:11.019
THINK MOST OF US ON THIS FLOOR

03:07:11.086 --> 03:07:13.255
KNOWS IS THAT IT ABSOLUTELY IS

03:07:13.322 --> 03:07:14.990
TRUE, AND THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING

03:07:15.057 --> 03:07:18.393
IS DANGEROUS AND THAT WE HAVE

03:07:18.460 --> 03:07:19.861
AN OBLIGATION JOINTLY, ACROSS

03:07:19.928 --> 03:07:21.196
PARTY LINES TO WORK TO MAKE

03:07:21.263 --> 03:07:22.965
SURE THAT NO COMMUNITY IS

03:07:23.031 --> 03:07:25.734
TERRORIZED, REGARDLESS OF HOW

03:07:25.801 --> 03:07:27.102
WE FEEL POLITICALLY OR WHAT

03:07:27.169 --> 03:07:29.037
FAME WE MIGHT WANT TO GAIN FROM

03:07:29.104 --> 03:07:32.074
POLITICAL HEADLINES, WE HAVE A

03:07:32.140 --> 03:07:33.909
MORAL OBLIGATION TO SERVE OUR

03:07:33.976 --> 03:07:35.177
COMMUNITIES AND TO STAND UP FOR

03:07:35.243 --> 03:07:37.312
OUR COMMUNITIES. AND SO, IN THE

03:07:37.379 --> 03:07:38.981
JEWISH CAUCUS, WE ARE PROUD TO

03:07:39.047 --> 03:07:40.248
STAND WITH IMMIGRANT

03:07:40.315 --> 03:07:42.584
COMMUNITIES AND TO CREATE A

03:07:42.651 --> 03:07:45.354
CULTURE IN CALIFORNIA THAT

03:07:45.420 --> 03:07:46.922
UPLIFTS AND AFFIRMS INSTEAD OF

03:07:46.989 --> 03:07:49.157
A CULTURE ACROSS OUR STATE THAT

03:07:49.224 --> 03:07:51.493
IS INTIMIDATING AND DIVIDING

03:07:51.560 --> 03:07:52.928
AND DISAPPEARING PEOPLE FROM

03:07:52.995 --> 03:07:55.163
OUR COMMUNITIES. AND SO,

03:07:55.230 --> 03:07:56.098
COLLEAGUES, I KNOW THAT MOST OF

03:07:56.164 --> 03:07:58.200
YOU KNOW THIS, BUT I'LL SAY IT

03:07:58.266 --> 03:08:00.002
ANYWAY THAT S¼ NINE IS MORE

03:08:00.068 --> 03:08:03.405
THAN A RESOLUTION. IT'S A

03:08:03.472 --> 03:08:04.006
DECLARATION THAT CALIFORNIANS

03:08:04.072 --> 03:08:07.009
THAT US IN THIS ROOM WON'T BE

03:08:07.075 --> 03:08:08.310
BULLIED INTO COMPLICITY OR MADE

03:08:08.377 --> 03:08:10.045
TO THINK THAT THIS IS NORMAL

03:08:10.112 --> 03:08:11.980
BECAUSE IT REALLY, TRULY IS NOT.

03:08:12.047 --> 03:08:13.015
WE'RE HERE TO DEFEND THE

03:08:13.081 --> 03:08:15.083
DIGNITY AND THE SAFETY OF THOSE

03:08:15.150 --> 03:08:17.753
THAT CALL OUR STATE HOME,

03:08:17.819 --> 03:08:19.254
INCLUDING OUR FRIENDS,

03:08:19.321 --> 03:08:20.022
RELATIVES, NEIGHBORS AND LOVED

03:08:20.088 --> 03:08:22.357
ONES. AND SO ON BEHALF OF THE

03:08:22.424 --> 03:08:23.625
CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE JEWISH

03:08:23.692 --> 03:08:25.060
CAUCUS AND IN SOLIDARITY WITH

03:08:25.127 --> 03:08:26.895
THE MANY, MANY FAMILIES WHO ARE

03:08:26.962 --> 03:08:29.331
TRULY LIVING UNDER THREAT, WE

03:08:29.398 --> 03:08:31.900
RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE.

03:08:31.967 --> 03:08:33.635

RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MR.

03:08:37.039 --> 03:08:39.775
SPEAKER. I RISE AS A PRIVILEGED

03:08:39.841 --> 03:08:41.977
POLYNESIAN MAN WHO HAD THE

03:08:42.044 --> 03:08:44.312
PRIVILEGE TO SPONSOR HIS

03:08:44.379 --> 03:08:46.948
MOTHER'S IMMIGRATION, WHO WENT

03:08:47.015 --> 03:08:49.184
THROUGH THE ENTIRE PROCESS, WHO

03:08:49.251 --> 03:08:52.354
CARES DEEPLY ABOUT THE

03:08:52.421 --> 03:08:53.655
IMMIGRATION AND THE IMMIGRATION

03:08:53.722 --> 03:08:55.957
SERVICES HERE, WHO HAS WORKED

03:08:56.024 --> 03:08:57.259
HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

03:08:57.325 --> 03:08:59.027
TAKING THE APPROACH TO SAY WE

03:08:59.094 --> 03:09:01.063
CARE ABOUT IMMIGRANTS. BUT WHAT

03:09:01.129 --> 03:09:03.565
IS HAPPENING HERE IS CHAOS

03:09:03.632 --> 03:09:06.435
BUILT IN RESOLUTIONS LIKE THIS

03:09:06.501 --> 03:09:09.104
AND SB 54. I REACHED OUT TO THE

03:09:09.171 --> 03:09:11.339
WHITE HOUSE ADMINISTRATION

03:09:11.406 --> 03:09:13.375
TRYING TO SAY, WHAT CAN WE DO

03:09:13.442 --> 03:09:14.276
TO TAKE CARE OF THE PEOPLE WHO

03:09:14.342 --> 03:09:15.944
ARE HERE? AND YOU KNOW WHAT

03:09:16.011 --> 03:09:18.013
THEY SAID TO ME? THEY SAID, SB

03:09:18.080 --> 03:09:19.681
54 IS CAUSING CHAOS BECAUSE WE

03:09:19.748 --> 03:09:20.916
CAN'T COORDINATE. IF WE JUST

03:09:20.982 --> 03:09:22.984
COULD PICK UP THE PEOPLE WHO

03:09:23.051 --> 03:09:24.686
ARE IN THE JAILS, WE'D STAY SO

03:09:24.753 --> 03:09:25.954
BUSY THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO

03:09:26.021 --> 03:09:28.090
DO ANYTHING ELSE IF WE COULD

03:09:28.156 --> 03:09:29.858
JUST COORDINATE WITH THE ISSUES

03:09:29.925 --> 03:09:31.193
THAT ARE HAPPENING IN LA WITH

03:09:31.259 --> 03:09:33.462
THE LOCAL OFFICIALS AND THE

03:09:33.528 --> 03:09:34.062
OTHER ELECTED LEADERS HERE, IT

03:09:34.129 --> 03:09:36.431
WOULD HELP US. BUT INSTEAD WE

03:09:36.498 --> 03:09:38.133
LIKE TO WRITE STRONGLY WORDED

03:09:38.200 --> 03:09:40.569
LETTERS AND DO NOTHING BUT

03:09:40.635 --> 03:09:42.204
STAND ON PLATITUDES NOT ROOTED

03:09:42.270 --> 03:09:44.005
IN REALITY AND CHAOS. I REACHED

03:09:44.072 --> 03:09:47.442
OUT TO THE OWNER OF THE OF THE

03:09:47.509 --> 03:09:48.043
HOME DEPOT BECAUSE I WANTED TO

03:09:48.110 --> 03:09:50.078
KNOW WHAT WAS WRONG. AND YOU

03:09:50.145 --> 03:09:51.446
KNOW WHAT THEY STATED? THEY

03:09:51.513 --> 03:09:53.014
STATED THEY SENT EMAIL AFTER

03:09:53.081 --> 03:09:55.016
EMAIL AFTER EMAIL TO MAYOR

03:09:55.083 --> 03:09:56.351
KAREN BASS AND TO THE GOVERNOR

03:09:56.418 --> 03:09:57.886
SAYING THAT THE IMMIGRANTS AT

03:09:57.953 --> 03:10:00.055
THE DAY LABOR CENTER THERE WERE

03:10:00.122 --> 03:10:01.823
BEING HELD HOSTAGE BY MS. 13.

03:10:01.890 --> 03:10:04.326
AND YET WE AREN'T PROTECTING

03:10:04.392 --> 03:10:06.294
THEM. THE FIRST DAY LABOR.

03:10:06.361 --> 03:10:10.332
EXCUSE ME. MR. DECORUM. MEMBERS.

03:10:10.398 --> 03:10:12.067
ASSEMBLY MEMBER MARK GONZALEZ,

03:10:12.134 --> 03:10:13.201
YOU'RE RECOGNIZED FOR YOUR

03:10:13.268 --> 03:10:14.336
POINT OF ORDER MAKING

03:10:14.402 --> 03:10:16.004
ACCUSATIONS. HE HAS NO ACTUAL

03:10:16.071 --> 03:10:17.506
EVIDENCE TO PROVE. WHAT HE'S

03:10:17.572 --> 03:10:19.608
SAYING IS FROM MS. 13. EXCUSE

03:10:19.674 --> 03:10:22.043
ME, MR. TUNUPA, THIS IS NOT A

03:10:22.110 --> 03:10:25.013
COURT OF LAW FAIR. MR. GONZALEZ,

03:10:25.080 --> 03:10:27.382
YOUR POINT IS NOT WELL TAKEN.

03:10:27.449 --> 03:10:29.918
MR. TUNUPA, PLEASE STAY ON THE

03:10:29.985 --> 03:10:32.254
BASIS OF WHAT THE RESOLUTION IS

03:10:32.320 --> 03:10:34.456
ABOUT. THANK YOU. SPEAK TO THE

03:10:34.523 --> 03:10:35.323
MERITS OF THE RESOLUTION. THANK

03:10:35.390 --> 03:10:37.159
YOU. THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND

03:10:37.225 --> 03:10:38.059
SECURITY, AND IT WAS ALSO

03:10:38.126 --> 03:10:39.961
REPORTED IN NATIONAL MEDIA ON

03:10:40.028 --> 03:10:41.930
THE EXACT CASE ON HOW THESE DAY

03:10:41.997 --> 03:10:43.198
LABORERS WERE ACTUALLY BEING

03:10:43.265 --> 03:10:46.234
HELD FOR EXTORTION. I THINK WE

03:10:46.301 --> 03:10:47.969
SHOULD PROTECT THEM. I THINK

03:10:48.036 --> 03:10:49.171
THOSE IMMIGRANTS THAT FOUGHT TO

03:10:49.237 --> 03:10:51.406
BE HERE TO LIVE THE AMERICAN

03:10:51.473 --> 03:10:53.141
DREAM DESERVE THE PROTECTIONS.

03:10:53.208 --> 03:10:55.243
BUT WE KEEP TRYING TO LUMP IN

03:10:55.310 --> 03:10:56.912
ALL OF THIS TO PAINT STORIES

03:10:56.978 --> 03:10:59.214
THAT DON'T HELP ANYBODY. WHEN

03:10:59.281 --> 03:11:00.482
THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY HERE

03:11:00.549 --> 03:11:02.317
IN THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY TO

03:11:02.384 --> 03:11:03.218
HELP WITH IMMIGRATION REFORM,

03:11:03.285 --> 03:11:06.087
WHAT HAPPENED? THE MAJORITY

03:11:06.154 --> 03:11:09.224
DENIED IT. AND INSTEAD, AGAIN,

03:11:09.291 --> 03:11:11.059
STRONGLY WORDED ESSAYS FILLED

03:11:11.126 --> 03:11:13.862
WITH PLATITUDES NOT ROOTED IN

03:11:13.929 --> 03:11:16.131
REALITY DON'T HELP ANYONE. AND

03:11:16.198 --> 03:11:18.767
WHEN YOU HAD THE CHANCE TO MAKE

03:11:18.834 --> 03:11:19.968
SPONSORING AN IMMIGRANT A

03:11:20.035 --> 03:11:22.304
COMPLETE TAX WRITE OFF, IT

03:11:22.370 --> 03:11:25.340
DIDN'T EVEN GET A CHANCE,

03:11:25.407 --> 03:11:30.045
DIDN'T EVEN GET A CHANCE. SO

03:11:30.111 --> 03:11:32.247
HOW CAN WE STAND HERE AND SAY,

03:11:32.314 --> 03:11:32.948
LET'S SEND ANOTHER LETTER,

03:11:33.014 --> 03:11:34.249
LET'S CREATE MORE CHAOS. LET'S

03:11:34.316 --> 03:11:37.219
NOT BE ROOTED IN REALITY. LET'S

03:11:37.285 --> 03:11:38.119
LET THESE OTHER IMMIGRANTS

03:11:38.186 --> 03:11:39.821
SUFFER BECAUSE WE CAN'T

03:11:39.888 --> 03:11:41.923
COORDINATE WITH THE FEDERAL

03:11:41.990 --> 03:11:42.924
ADMINISTRATION. IT'S TIME FOR

03:11:42.991 --> 03:11:45.260
US TO DO OUR JOBS AND VOTE NO

03:11:45.327 --> 03:11:49.364
ON THIS S¼ THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

03:11:49.431 --> 03:11:51.166
MEMBER. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

03:11:51.233 --> 03:11:56.638
QUIRK-SILVA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

03:11:56.705 --> 03:11:58.974
THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. I STAND

03:11:59.040 --> 03:12:03.912
IN STRONG SUPPORT OF COR. YOU

03:12:03.979 --> 03:12:06.314
KNOW, THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT

03:12:06.381 --> 03:12:08.049
TIME, I THINK, ACROSS OUR

03:12:08.116 --> 03:12:10.585
NATION AND THE COLOR OF OUR

03:12:10.652 --> 03:12:15.757
SKIN HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP. I

03:12:15.824 --> 03:12:18.260
WANT YOU TO LOOK AT MYSELF. I'M

03:12:18.326 --> 03:12:19.294
FROM ORANGE COUNTY, NORTH

03:12:19.361 --> 03:12:21.863
ORANGE COUNTY. I DON'T SPEAK

03:12:21.930 --> 03:12:24.099
SPANISH. AND YET WHEN I GO ON

03:12:24.165 --> 03:12:26.902
WALKS AT NIGHT WITH MY HUSBAND,

03:12:26.968 --> 03:12:33.808
HIS TH¤U SILVA, I DO HAVE FEAR.

03:12:33.875 --> 03:12:36.111
JOKINGLY, AROUND JANUARY MY

03:12:36.177 --> 03:12:38.213
BROTHER IN LAW WAS GOING TO BUY

03:12:38.280 --> 03:12:41.016
OR DID BUY A HOME IN MEXICO AND

03:12:41.082 --> 03:12:43.852
I SAID YOU SHOULD TAKE YOUR

03:12:43.919 --> 03:12:47.856
PASSPORT JOKINGLY, BUT NOW IT'S

03:12:47.923 --> 03:12:55.096
REAL. THESE ARE TIMES THAT IN

03:12:55.163 --> 03:12:56.798
MY 63 YEARS, I NEVER THOUGHT

03:12:56.865 --> 03:13:00.335
THAT I WOULD SEE. AND YES,

03:13:00.402 --> 03:13:02.537
THERE HAVE BEEN IMMIGRANTS THAT

03:13:02.604 --> 03:13:05.140
HAVE BROKEN THE LAW. AND YES,

03:13:05.206 --> 03:13:07.242
THERE WAS AN ELECTION WHERE

03:13:07.309 --> 03:13:09.911
PEOPLE SAID, WE WANT TO DO

03:13:09.978 --> 03:13:12.814
SOMETHING ABOUT IT. WE WANT TO

03:13:12.881 --> 03:13:14.716
DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE

03:13:14.783 --> 03:13:18.420
CRIMINALS. BUT THERE WAS NOT A

03:13:18.486 --> 03:13:20.121
TIME WHERE WE SAID, WE WANT TO

03:13:20.188 --> 03:13:23.124
SEE RAIDS AT OUR CARWASHES. WE

03:13:23.191 --> 03:13:24.926
WANT TO SEE RAIDS IN

03:13:24.993 --> 03:13:27.028
HOUSEKEEPING. WE WANT TO SEE

03:13:27.095 --> 03:13:28.863
PEOPLE YANKED OUT OF

03:13:28.930 --> 03:13:32.133
RESTAURANTS. WE WANT TO SEE

03:13:32.200 --> 03:13:32.867
HARDWORKING CALIFORNIANS THAT

03:13:32.934 --> 03:13:36.471
ARE ON OUR FARMS, YANKED OUT,

03:13:36.538 --> 03:13:40.308
THROWN TO THE GROUND. THIS IS

03:13:40.375 --> 03:13:42.944
NOT FEAR MONGERING, MONGERING.

03:13:43.011 --> 03:13:45.213
THIS IS REAL. SO UNLESS WE

03:13:45.280 --> 03:13:47.148
WATCHED COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

03:13:47.215 --> 03:13:50.085
REALITIES, THIS IS REAL. PEOPLE

03:13:50.151 --> 03:13:55.123
ARE BEING SENT. TO PLACES WE

03:13:55.190 --> 03:13:56.992
DON'T EVEN KNOW. THEIR FAMILY

03:13:57.058 --> 03:13:58.960
IS NOT ABLE TO TRACK THEM.

03:13:59.027 --> 03:14:01.096
SOMETIMES FOR DAYS, SOMETIMES

03:14:01.162 --> 03:14:03.965
FOR WEEKS AND EVEN MONTHS. DUE

03:14:04.032 --> 03:14:07.469
PROCESS HAS EVAPORATED. BUT THE

03:14:07.535 --> 03:14:09.237
IRONY, IRONY IS WHERE ARE

03:14:09.304 --> 03:14:11.873
PEOPLE BEING TAKEN FROM? MOST

03:14:11.940 --> 03:14:14.476
OF THE TIME? THEIR JOBS, THEIR

03:14:14.542 --> 03:14:18.680
JOBS. AND WE KNOW THE

03:14:18.747 --> 03:14:20.248
CONTRIBUTIONS OF IMMIGRANTS TO

03:14:20.315 --> 03:14:22.050
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS

03:14:22.117 --> 03:14:24.285
ENORMOUS. AND YET WE HEAR WORDS

03:14:24.352 --> 03:14:27.155
LIKE HANDOUTS. THESE ARE PEOPLE

03:14:27.222 --> 03:14:28.790
WHO ARE MAKING THE BEDS AND

03:14:28.857 --> 03:14:31.459
THESE NICE HOTELS THAT PEOPLE

03:14:31.526 --> 03:14:34.362
GO TO TO ENJOY THEMSELVES ON

03:14:34.429 --> 03:14:37.098
OUR COAST AND OUR RESORT AREAS.

03:14:37.165 --> 03:14:40.001
THESE ARE PEOPLE IN THE BACK

03:14:40.068 --> 03:14:41.736
KITCHENS THAT ARE COOKING OUR

03:14:41.803 --> 03:14:43.371
MEALS. THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT

03:14:43.438 --> 03:14:46.174
ARE HIRED TO DO HOUSEKEEPING,

03:14:46.241 --> 03:14:49.010
CHILD CARE. AND YES, THEY'RE

03:14:49.077 --> 03:14:50.311
OUR NEIGHBORS AND OUR FRIENDS,

03:14:50.378 --> 03:14:52.814
BUT THEY'RE ALSO CONTRIBUTING

03:14:52.881 --> 03:14:55.450
TO OUR ECONOMY. PLACES LIKE

03:14:55.517 --> 03:14:58.453
SANTA ANA THAT WERE BUSTLING

03:14:58.520 --> 03:15:01.990
AND ADDING TO OUR ECONOMY ARE

03:15:02.057 --> 03:15:04.659
LIKE GHOST TOWNS LIKE OLVERA

03:15:04.726 --> 03:15:07.662
STREET ARE ICONIC. OLVERA

03:15:07.729 --> 03:15:09.831
STREET BOARDED UP, OUR FLOWER

03:15:09.898 --> 03:15:12.767
MARKETS. I THINK SOME OF YOU

03:15:12.834 --> 03:15:14.102
MIGHT GO TO WEDDINGS, SOME OF

03:15:14.169 --> 03:15:16.638
YOU MIGHT GO TO CELEBRATIONS IN

03:15:16.704 --> 03:15:17.739
THOSE FLOWERS COME FROM

03:15:17.806 --> 03:15:20.175
SOMEWHERE. SOME OF YOU MIGHT

03:15:20.241 --> 03:15:22.544
LIKE THOSE ROTISSERIE CHICKENS

03:15:22.610 --> 03:15:25.080
THAT WE GET AT COSTCO. THOSE

03:15:25.146 --> 03:15:28.216
COME FROM CHICKEN FACTORIES.

03:15:28.283 --> 03:15:30.251
SOME OF YOU LIKE THE FRUITS AND

03:15:30.318 --> 03:15:32.187
VEGETABLES THAT WE SEE HERE IN

03:15:32.253 --> 03:15:35.356
OUR LOUNGE. THOSE COME FROM

03:15:35.423 --> 03:15:39.160
FARM WORKERS. THE OTHER IRONY

03:15:39.227 --> 03:15:40.962
IS WHERE ARE PEOPLE BEING TAKEN

03:15:41.029 --> 03:15:45.300
FROM OUR COURTS? AND WE HEAR

03:15:45.366 --> 03:15:47.102
OFTEN, JUST COME HERE LEGALLY,

03:15:47.168 --> 03:15:50.538
DO IT THE RIGHT WAY. WHAT DO

03:15:50.605 --> 03:15:51.473
YOU THINK THEY'RE DOING IN THE

03:15:51.539 --> 03:15:57.479
COURTS? SO WE CAN USE WORDS. WE

03:15:57.545 --> 03:16:01.382
CAN USE NUMBERS WE CAN USE DATA.

03:16:01.449 --> 03:16:04.986
I HEARD 70% SAY THAT THIS IS

03:16:05.053 --> 03:16:07.589
THE RIGHT WAY. I'VE READ POLLS

03:16:07.655 --> 03:16:10.592
THAT SAY THAT CALIFORNIANS DO

03:16:10.658 --> 03:16:15.363
NOT LIKE THESE RAIDS. YES, THEY

03:16:15.430 --> 03:16:16.231
DISLIKED CRIMINALS, BUT THEY

03:16:16.297 --> 03:16:19.701
DID NOT EVER IMAGINE WHAT'S

03:16:19.767 --> 03:16:29.077
HAPPENING NOW. SO AS I WALK

03:16:29.144 --> 03:16:31.913
WITH THE COLOR OF MY SKIN, MY

03:16:31.980 --> 03:16:33.581
FAMILY WHO LIVES IN HUNTINGTON

03:16:33.648 --> 03:16:36.050
PARK, MY IN-LAWS ARE AFRAID TO

03:16:36.117 --> 03:16:38.186
GO OUT AT NIGHT, DO NOT

03:16:38.253 --> 03:16:40.588
GASLIGHT US AND TELL US THIS IS

03:16:40.655 --> 03:16:43.258
FEARMONGERING. DO NOT DIMINISH

03:16:43.324 --> 03:16:46.127
WHAT IS HAPPENING. DO NOT TRY

03:16:46.194 --> 03:16:48.296
TO UNDERSTAND THE TRAUMA THAT

03:16:48.363 --> 03:16:50.198
YOUNG KIDS AND TEENAGERS ARE

03:16:50.265 --> 03:16:52.200
GOING WHEN THEY COME HOME AND

03:16:52.267 --> 03:16:53.501
WONDER IF THEIR PARENTS ARE

03:16:53.568 --> 03:16:55.003
THERE, OR THE WORKERS WHO

03:16:55.069 --> 03:16:57.138
WONDER IF THEY'RE GOING TO COME

03:16:57.205 --> 03:16:59.474
HOME. EVEN LANDSCAPERS HAVE

03:16:59.541 --> 03:17:01.342
BEEN PULLED OUT OF THEIR TRUCKS

03:17:01.409 --> 03:17:05.079
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LADDER AND

03:17:05.146 --> 03:17:08.716
THEY'RE BEING PROFILED. WITH

03:17:08.783 --> 03:17:10.185
THIS, I STAND STRONGLY IN

03:17:10.251 --> 03:17:15.223

NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES

03:17:43.151 --> 03:17:45.153
DO NOT MAKE ANYONE SAFER.

03:17:45.220 --> 03:17:47.322
INSTEAD, THEY INSTILL FEAR AND

03:17:47.388 --> 03:17:49.224
FAMILIES WHO ARE SIMPLY TRYING

03:17:49.290 --> 03:17:50.892
TO GO ABOUT THEIR DAILY LIVES.

03:17:50.959 --> 03:17:52.193
OUR AAPI COMMUNITIES AND

03:17:52.260 --> 03:17:54.395
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES KNOW THIS

03:17:54.462 --> 03:17:55.230
FEAR ALL TOO WELL. IMMIGRANTS

03:17:55.296 --> 03:17:57.031
COME TO THE UNITED STATES

03:17:57.098 --> 03:17:59.100
SEEKING SAFETY AND OPPORTUNITY,

03:17:59.167 --> 03:18:01.169
YET TODAY THEY FACE THREATS,

03:18:01.236 --> 03:18:03.071
DISRUPTION, AND THE CONSTANT

03:18:03.137 --> 03:18:04.239
ANXIETY OF BEING TAKEN AWAY

03:18:04.305 --> 03:18:06.074
FROM THEIR FAMILIES. TO TARGET

03:18:06.140 --> 03:18:08.409
IMMIGRANTS IS NOT ONLY UNJUST,

03:18:08.476 --> 03:18:09.010
IT UNDERMINES THE VERY VALUES

03:18:09.077 --> 03:18:11.312
OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ON

03:18:11.379 --> 03:18:13.114

LATINO CAUCUS AND OUR IMMIGRANT

03:18:39.641 --> 03:18:40.174
NEIGHBORS WHO ARE BEING

03:18:40.241 --> 03:18:41.175
TERRORIZED BY AN ADMINISTRATION

03:18:41.242 --> 03:18:42.977
DETERMINED TO DIVIDE, PUNISH,

03:18:43.044 --> 03:18:45.179
AND INSTILL FEAR, AND TO REALLY

03:18:45.246 --> 03:18:45.913
REFLECT AND UNDERSCORE SO MANY

03:18:45.980 --> 03:18:47.215
OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE

03:18:47.282 --> 03:18:49.183
ON THE FLOOR HERE TODAY. WE

03:18:49.250 --> 03:18:50.418

COMMUNITY ARE NO STRANGER TO

03:18:51.786 --> 03:18:53.221
THE TARGETING AND HATE THAT WE

03:18:53.288 --> 03:18:55.323
EXPERIENCE EVERY DAY, AND HAS

03:18:55.390 --> 03:18:56.157
BEEN PARTICULARLY INDIRECTLY

03:18:56.224 --> 03:18:58.459
ESCALATED BY THIS

03:18:58.526 --> 03:18:58.893
ADMINISTRATION. OUR

03:18:58.960 --> 03:19:00.028
CONSTITUENTS ACROSS THE STATE

03:19:00.094 --> 03:19:02.130
ARE OUTRAGED AT THESE AGENTS IN

03:19:02.196 --> 03:19:04.032
UNMARKED VANS DESCENDING ON OUR

03:19:04.098 --> 03:19:06.701
NEIGHBORHOODS, CAUSING FEAR,

03:19:06.768 --> 03:19:07.335
CONFUSION AND HEARTBREAK. AND,

03:19:07.402 --> 03:19:08.936
YOU KNOW, THESE ARE NOT JUST

03:19:09.003 --> 03:19:10.471
HEADLINES WE'VE HEARD. THESE

03:19:10.538 --> 03:19:11.873
ARE REAL PEOPLE PARENTS,

03:19:11.939 --> 03:19:13.741
CHILDREN, WORKERS, NEIGHBORS

03:19:13.808 --> 03:19:15.009
BEING DISAPPEARED WITHOUT

03:19:15.076 --> 03:19:16.911
WARNING. IN MY DISTRICT, THIS

03:19:16.978 --> 03:19:18.413
HAPPENED OUTSIDE OF A POPULAR

03:19:18.479 --> 03:19:20.081
FAMILY RESTAURANT IN THE SOUTH

03:19:20.148 --> 03:19:21.949
PARK NEIGHBORHOOD AND IN THE

03:19:22.016 --> 03:19:22.950
MISSION VALLEY NEIGHBORHOOD, IN

03:19:23.017 --> 03:19:24.252
A HOTEL PARKING LOT, MASKED,

03:19:24.319 --> 03:19:25.286
UNMARKED, SUPPOSED AGENTS

03:19:25.353 --> 03:19:27.588
ABDUCTED A US CITIZEN HOTEL

03:19:27.655 --> 03:19:29.257
WORKER WHO WAS NOT THE SUBJECT

03:19:29.324 --> 03:19:30.958
OF A WARRANT FOR THE PERSON

03:19:31.025 --> 03:19:32.560
THEY WERE SEEKING, AND YET THEY

03:19:32.627 --> 03:19:34.162
STILL PUT HER IN THE VAN AND

03:19:34.228 --> 03:19:36.297
TOOK HER AWAY FOR DAYS IN THE

03:19:36.364 --> 03:19:37.065
LINDA VISTA COMMUNITY DURING

03:19:37.131 --> 03:19:40.368
OUR SUMMER RECESS, A UNMARKED

03:19:40.435 --> 03:19:42.370
AGENT DETAINED A PARENT, RIPPED

03:19:42.437 --> 03:19:43.404
HIM AWAY FROM HIS CHILD. THE

03:19:43.471 --> 03:19:44.972
FOURTH SUCH INCIDENT IN SAN

03:19:45.039 --> 03:19:47.709
DIEGO COUNTY, WHERE AGENTS WERE

03:19:47.775 --> 03:19:49.010
COMING TO OUR SCHOOLS. ONE CASE,

03:19:49.077 --> 03:19:51.079
ACTUALLY IN THE CITY OF CHULA

03:19:51.145 --> 03:19:51.979
VISTA, TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A

03:19:52.046 --> 03:19:54.015
PARENT OUTSIDE OF THE CAR WITH

03:19:54.082 --> 03:19:56.050
TWO KIDS IN THE BACK SEAT. THIS

03:19:56.117 --> 03:19:56.951
IS WHAT CALIFORNIANS ARE SEEING,

03:19:57.018 --> 03:19:58.219
AND THIS IS WHAT WE ABSOLUTELY

03:19:58.286 --> 03:19:59.987
MUST STAND UP FOR AGAINST

03:20:00.054 --> 03:20:01.589
HAPPENING EVERY DAY IN OUR

03:20:01.656 --> 03:20:03.291
COMMUNITY. LET'S BE CLEAR THIS

03:20:03.358 --> 03:20:04.125
IS NOT MAKING OUR COMMUNITY

03:20:04.192 --> 03:20:05.893
SAFER. BAD ACTORS ARE NOW

03:20:05.960 --> 03:20:07.028
IMPERSONATING ICE AGENTS.

03:20:07.095 --> 03:20:09.797
PUBLIC SAFETY HAS BEEN REPLACED

03:20:09.864 --> 03:20:11.966
BY STATE SANCTIONED TERROR. AND

03:20:12.033 --> 03:20:14.102
OF COURSE, THE CONGRESS PASSING

03:20:14.168 --> 03:20:15.903
THEIR H.R. ONE, THE BIG THE BIG

03:20:15.970 --> 03:20:18.806
UGLY BILL. THE FEDS HAS GIVEN A

03:20:18.873 --> 03:20:20.241
$45 BILLION SLUSH FUND FOR

03:20:20.308 --> 03:20:21.109
ICE'S REIGN OF TERROR. AND

03:20:21.175 --> 03:20:23.478
WE'RE SEEING THIS PRESIDENT USE

03:20:23.544 --> 03:20:24.045
FEDERAL AGENTS TO PUNISH HIS

03:20:24.112 --> 03:20:25.980
POLITICAL OPPONENTS. IT'S

03:20:26.047 --> 03:20:27.048
AUTHORITARIANISM IN PLAIN SIGHT.

03:20:27.115 --> 03:20:29.550
AND AS SUCH, WE SAY WE WILL NOT

03:20:29.617 --> 03:20:30.084
BE SILENT, WE WILL NOT BE

03:20:30.151 --> 03:20:32.120
INTIMIDATED, AND WE WILL NOT

03:20:32.186 --> 03:20:33.054
BACK DOWN, AND WE WILL NOT, AS

03:20:33.121 --> 03:20:34.989
THE MEMBER FROM ORANGE COUNTY

03:20:35.056 --> 03:20:36.224
SAID, BE GASLIGHTED, THAT THIS

03:20:36.290 --> 03:20:37.859
IS SOMEHOW IN RESPONSE TO THE

03:20:37.925 --> 03:20:38.993
IMPORTANT WORK AND DEBATE AND

03:20:39.060 --> 03:20:41.062
VALUES THAT WE HOLD UP HERE AND

03:20:41.129 --> 03:20:42.063
THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE ENACTED

03:20:42.130 --> 03:20:43.998
HERE ON THIS FLOOR, WE STAND UP

03:20:44.065 --> 03:20:45.299
FOR THOSE VALUES BECAUSE THEY

03:20:45.366 --> 03:20:46.801
ARE ROOTED IN DECENCY AND IN

03:20:46.868 --> 03:20:48.035
GOOD INTENTIONS AND IN THOUGHT

03:20:48.102 --> 03:20:49.203
ABOUT HOW WE ADDRESS THIS

03:20:49.270 --> 03:20:51.372
IMPORTANT ISSUE. UNLIKE YEARS

03:20:51.439 --> 03:20:52.540
AGO, I'M YOUNG ENOUGH TO

03:20:52.607 --> 03:20:54.142
REMEMBER OR WAS OLD ENOUGH TO

03:20:54.208 --> 03:20:55.943
REMEMBER JUST A FEW YEARS AGO

03:20:56.010 --> 03:20:57.145
WHEN THE US SENATE HAD A

03:20:57.211 --> 03:20:59.380
BIPARTISAN SOLUTION TO BE ABLE

03:20:59.447 --> 03:21:00.014
TO NOT ONLY ADDRESS ISSUES AND

03:21:00.081 --> 03:21:02.283
BORDER SECURITY, BUT ALSO

03:21:02.350 --> 03:21:03.117
IMMIGRATION REFORM, WHICH OF

03:21:03.184 --> 03:21:04.919
COURSE, THEN WAS TANKED AND

03:21:04.986 --> 03:21:07.121
TOLD TO VOTE DOWN AND MAKE SURE

03:21:07.188 --> 03:21:09.190
THAT THAT NEVER SAW THE

03:21:09.257 --> 03:21:10.224
PRESIDENT'S DESK BY THEN

03:21:10.291 --> 03:21:12.160
CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP. WE KNOW

03:21:12.226 --> 03:21:13.327
WHO IS ACTUALLY CONTINUING THIS

03:21:13.394 --> 03:21:14.929
REIGN OF TERROR HERE IN OUR

03:21:14.996 --> 03:21:16.798
NEIGHBORHOOD. AND SO, YES, I'VE

03:21:16.864 --> 03:21:17.231
SEEN THOSE POLLS TO

03:21:17.298 --> 03:21:18.666
CALIFORNIANS WANT SMART,

03:21:18.733 --> 03:21:19.400
SENSIBLE SOLUTIONS, AND WE WANT

03:21:19.467 --> 03:21:21.369
SAFE COMMUNITIES. THEY DO NOT

03:21:21.436 --> 03:21:24.071
WANT PEACEFUL NEIGHBORS RIPPED

03:21:24.138 --> 03:21:26.073
OUT OF SCHOOLS, RIPPED OUT OF

03:21:26.140 --> 03:21:27.875
HOSPITALS, RIPPED OUT OF THEIR

03:21:27.942 --> 03:21:29.043
WORKPLACES IN THE NAME OF

03:21:29.110 --> 03:21:31.212
WHATEVER THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO

03:21:31.279 --> 03:21:33.114
REFRAME IT AS I, ALONG WITH

03:21:33.181 --> 03:21:34.182
OTHER MEMBERS OF THE LGBT

03:21:34.248 --> 03:21:36.150
CAUCUS, STAND PROUDLY IN

03:21:36.217 --> 03:21:36.951
SOLIDARITY WITH OUR LATINO

03:21:37.018 --> 03:21:38.085
BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND OUR

03:21:38.152 --> 03:21:39.720
FELLOW DIVERSITY CAUCUSES,

03:21:39.787 --> 03:21:40.788
BECAUSE TOGETHER WE WILL SAY

03:21:40.855 --> 03:21:43.458
THAT WE WANT NO MORE FAMILY

03:21:43.524 --> 03:21:44.392
SEPARATIONS, NO MORE

03:21:44.459 --> 03:21:44.892
INDISCRIMINATE POLITICAL

03:21:44.959 --> 03:21:46.360
RETALIATION, AND NO MORE

03:21:46.427 --> 03:21:48.062
MILITARIZATION AGAINST OUR

03:21:48.129 --> 03:21:50.231
CIVILIANS. AS SR NINE SENDS A

03:21:50.298 --> 03:21:52.099
CLEAR SIGNAL THAT ICE HAS NO

03:21:52.166 --> 03:21:53.367
PLACE IN OUR SCHOOLS OR

03:21:53.434 --> 03:21:55.369
HOSPITALS OR PLACES OF WORSHIP,

03:21:55.436 --> 03:21:57.638
OR ANY PLACES THAT CALIFORNIA

03:21:57.705 --> 03:21:58.372
SEEKS SAFETY MEASURES. THAT'S

03:21:58.439 --> 03:22:00.975
WHY I PROUDLY SUPPORT COR NINE,

03:22:01.042 --> 03:22:03.344
AND I ASK THAT YOU JOIN ME IN

03:22:03.411 --> 03:22:05.079
KIND. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

03:22:05.146 --> 03:22:06.614
MEMBER WARD. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

03:22:06.681 --> 03:22:07.949
PAPIN, YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

03:22:08.015 --> 03:22:10.051
THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. I'LL BE

03:22:10.117 --> 03:22:11.252
BRIEF. I'M RISING TODAY,

03:22:11.319 --> 03:22:12.920
ACTUALLY, IN THE SPIRIT OF OUR

03:22:12.987 --> 03:22:13.988
COLLEAGUE FROM PALO ALTO WHO

03:22:14.055 --> 03:22:15.656
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE HERE TODAY.

03:22:15.723 --> 03:22:17.124
YOU KNOW, OUR COLLEAGUES ACROSS

03:22:17.191 --> 03:22:19.393
THE AISLE ARE VERY CONCERNED

03:22:19.460 --> 03:22:20.928
ABOUT THE ILLEGAL STATUS OF

03:22:20.995 --> 03:22:24.165
HARD WORKING IMMIGRANTS. I

03:22:24.232 --> 03:22:25.867
THINK WE WOULD ALL BE WELL

03:22:25.933 --> 03:22:28.503
SERVED, ALL OF US, IF THEY

03:22:28.569 --> 03:22:30.938
REDIRECTED THEIR FOCUS FROM THE

03:22:31.005 --> 03:22:33.508
STATUS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TO

03:22:33.574 --> 03:22:35.109
THE STATUS AND THE CONDUCT OF

03:22:35.176 --> 03:22:36.978
THE CONVICTED FELON WHO

03:22:37.044 --> 03:22:38.880
OCCUPIES THE WHITE HOUSE. THANK

03:22:38.946 --> 03:22:41.649
YOU. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

03:22:41.716 --> 03:22:43.384
PAPIN. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

03:22:43.451 --> 03:22:50.691
EL-HAWARY. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

03:22:50.758 --> 03:22:52.727
THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. AND

03:22:52.793 --> 03:22:55.563
MEMBERS, I RISE TODAY IN STRONG

03:22:55.630 --> 03:22:57.331
SUPPORT OF COR NINE. IN MY

03:22:57.398 --> 03:22:59.066
DISTRICT, RAIDS HAVE REACHED

03:22:59.133 --> 03:23:01.135
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS, LEAVING OUR

03:23:01.202 --> 03:23:03.237
CHILDREN LIVING IN FEAR. THAT

03:23:03.304 --> 03:23:05.339
IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE.

03:23:05.406 --> 03:23:07.108
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN LOS ANGELES

03:23:07.174 --> 03:23:09.544
IS NOT ISOLATED. IT'S A TEST

03:23:09.610 --> 03:23:12.647
RUN FOR CITIES, AND IT'S A TEST

03:23:12.713 --> 03:23:14.549
RUN FOR RAIDS NATIONWIDE,

03:23:14.615 --> 03:23:15.917
MILITARIZING CITIES THAT THIS

03:23:15.983 --> 03:23:18.119
RACIST IN CHIEF WANTS TO TARGET.

03:23:18.185 --> 03:23:19.687
THESE TACTICS TERRORIZE

03:23:19.754 --> 03:23:21.088
FAMILIES INSTEAD OF KEEPING

03:23:21.155 --> 03:23:23.190
THEM SAFE. IN MONROVIA, A MAN

03:23:23.257 --> 03:23:26.027
WAS KILLED FLEEING ICE AGENTS

03:23:26.093 --> 03:23:28.162
IN CAMARILLO, FARMWORKERS WERE

03:23:28.229 --> 03:23:31.032
HUNTED IN THE FIELDS AND A MAN

03:23:31.098 --> 03:23:31.966
DIED TRYING TO GET AWAY. THIS

03:23:32.033 --> 03:23:33.568
IS NOT ABOUT TARGETING

03:23:33.634 --> 03:23:34.969
CRIMINALS. IT'S ABOUT TARGETING

03:23:35.036 --> 03:23:36.804
PEOPLE WHO LOOK A CERTAIN WAY,

03:23:36.871 --> 03:23:39.006
WHO LOOK LIKE ME, WHO LOOK LIKE

03:23:39.073 --> 03:23:41.809
SO MANY OF US ON THIS FLOOR.

03:23:41.876 --> 03:23:44.245
THESE RAIDS RIP WORKERS FROM

03:23:44.312 --> 03:23:46.180
JOBS THAT FEED OUR FAMILIES,

03:23:46.247 --> 03:23:48.816
BUILD OUR COMMUNITIES AND KEEP

03:23:48.883 --> 03:23:50.585
OUR ECONOMY STRONG. BUT THE

03:23:50.651 --> 03:23:52.086
SCAMMER IN CHIEF, HE DOESN'T

03:23:52.153 --> 03:23:54.255
CARE ABOUT ANY OF THAT. TRUMP

03:23:54.322 --> 03:23:55.790
DOESN'T CARE ABOUT US. HIS

03:23:55.856 --> 03:23:57.959
RIDICULOUS RAIDS DON'T HELP US.

03:23:58.025 --> 03:23:59.760
AND THIS PRESIDENT SURE AS HELL

03:23:59.827 --> 03:24:01.429
DOESN'T CARE ABOUT TANKING THE

03:24:01.495 --> 03:24:03.097

OFF OF FARMS AND HOTELS,

03:24:09.003 --> 03:24:11.005
BECAUSE HE'S ONLY LOOKING TO

03:24:11.072 --> 03:24:13.441
PROTECT PROFITS, NOT PEOPLE.

03:24:13.507 --> 03:24:15.543
CALIFORNIA IS A SANCTUARY STATE

PERSON SHOULD LIVE IN FEAR

03:24:26.253 --> 03:24:27.922

LET'S BE EXTRAORDINARILY CLEAR.

03:25:55.943 --> 03:25:59.380

POISON THE BLOOD OF OUR COUNTRY.

03:27:11.418 --> 03:27:16.023
THAT IS AN EXACT QUOTE. THAT'S

03:27:16.090 --> 03:27:18.159
WHY A JUDGE HAD TO TELL ICE

03:27:18.225 --> 03:27:20.027
THEY CANNOT JUST WALK UP TO

03:27:20.094 --> 03:27:23.230

03:27:38.112 --> 03:27:40.881
MORE THAN HIS SKIN COLOR.

03:27:40.948 --> 03:27:44.752
WELCOME TO TRUMP'S AMERICA. I

03:27:44.819 --> 03:27:46.954

THIS LEGISLATION, AS JEANNINE,

03:29:48.742 --> 03:29:51.946

03:30:14.969 --> 03:30:17.037
BEEN REMOVED AND DISAPPEARED.

03:30:17.104 --> 03:30:20.607

OUR CONSTITUENTS IN THE STATE

03:30:23.077 --> 03:30:26.046

DENY THAT THAT IS WHAT IS

03:30:28.082 --> 03:30:30.050

03:30:45.866 --> 03:30:47.267

THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON MY MIND

03:30:49.303 --> 03:30:50.404

03:30:50.471 --> 03:30:51.138
WHILE SOME DENY THE REALITY

03:30:51.205 --> 03:30:52.139
THAT'S HAPPENING ALL ACROSS

03:30:52.206 --> 03:30:54.908
CALIFORNIA. FIRST PERSON I WAS

03:30:54.975 --> 03:30:56.043
THINKING ABOUT HEARING YOU ALL

03:30:56.110 --> 03:30:58.178
SPEAK WAS ARTURO VASQUEZ.

03:30:58.245 --> 03:30:59.947
ARTURO VASQUEZ WAS KIDNAPED,

03:31:00.014 --> 03:31:01.482
SEPARATED FROM HIS FAMILY AT A

03:31:01.548 --> 03:31:03.283
CAR WASH. NOW, YOU MIGHT ASK,

03:31:03.350 --> 03:31:04.184
WHAT CRIME DID HE COMMIT? THERE

03:31:04.251 --> 03:31:07.521
WAS NONE. YOU MIGHT ASK IF THEY

03:31:07.588 --> 03:31:07.988
HAD A WARRANT FOR HIS

03:31:08.055 --> 03:31:09.957
EMPLOYMENT AT THE CAR WASH. HE

03:31:10.024 --> 03:31:11.325
WAS NOT AN EMPLOYEE OF THAT CAR

03:31:11.392 --> 03:31:13.894
WASH. HE WAS GETTING HIS CAR

03:31:13.961 --> 03:31:15.262
WASHED WITH HIS FIVE YEAR OLD

03:31:15.329 --> 03:31:17.865
IN THE CAR. TELL ME HOW

03:31:17.931 --> 03:31:19.099
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT COULD

03:31:19.166 --> 03:31:21.769
EVEN TALK TO VASQUEZ WITHOUT

03:31:21.835 --> 03:31:22.970
RACIAL PROFILING HIM.

03:31:23.037 --> 03:31:24.171
THANKFULLY, THE COURTS HAVE

03:31:24.238 --> 03:31:26.006
AGREED AND ENDED THE RACIAL

03:31:26.073 --> 03:31:27.641
PROFILING THAT WAS HAPPENING IN

03:31:27.708 --> 03:31:29.410
LOS ANGELES ALLOWED FOR FOLKS

03:31:29.476 --> 03:31:31.245
WHO HAVE BEEN DETAINED TO HAVE

03:31:31.311 --> 03:31:32.246
THE LEGAL REPRESENTATION THEY

03:31:32.312 --> 03:31:34.181
DESERVE AND ARE ENTITLED TO

03:31:34.248 --> 03:31:36.984
UNDER BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS. I WAS

03:31:37.051 --> 03:31:39.853
ALSO THINKING ABOUT ESTHER.

03:31:39.920 --> 03:31:42.022
ESTHER'S DAD WORKED AT THAT

03:31:42.089 --> 03:31:43.524
VERY SAME CAR WASH THAT SAME

03:31:43.590 --> 03:31:47.094
DAY, AND HE WAS TAKEN. AND THE

03:31:47.161 --> 03:31:48.829
FOLLOWING DAY, WHEN SHE WAS

03:31:48.896 --> 03:31:51.098
GRADUATING FROM SCHOOL WITH ALL

03:31:51.165 --> 03:31:52.900
OF HER ACCOLADES THAT SHE HAD

03:31:52.966 --> 03:31:55.035
EARNED FOR HER HARD WORK, ALL

03:31:55.102 --> 03:31:57.371
SHE COULD DO WAS THINK ABOUT

03:31:57.438 --> 03:32:01.141
WHERE HER FATHER WAS. WITH NO

03:32:01.208 --> 03:32:05.145
INFORMATION, NOTHING TO GO ON,

03:32:05.212 --> 03:32:07.948
NO CRIMES COMMITTED. THAT'S

03:32:08.015 --> 03:32:10.150
HAPPENING ALL ACROSS OUR STATE

03:32:10.217 --> 03:32:11.919
IN EVERY SINGLE DISTRICT,

03:32:11.985 --> 03:32:14.788
DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN. AND IN

03:32:14.855 --> 03:32:16.490
RESPONSE TO THE COMMUNITY'S

03:32:16.557 --> 03:32:18.192
RIGHTEOUS OUTRAGE THAT TOOK

03:32:18.258 --> 03:32:20.260
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS TO THE

03:32:20.327 --> 03:32:22.629
STREETS, THEY SENT IN THE

03:32:22.696 --> 03:32:24.298
MILITARY TO SUPPRESS OUR CITY.

03:32:24.364 --> 03:32:28.135
MY CITY, $134 MILLION FOR MY

03:32:28.202 --> 03:32:29.369
FISCAL CONSERVATIVE FRIENDS,

03:32:29.436 --> 03:32:33.740
WAS SPENT MILITARIZING LOS

03:32:33.807 --> 03:32:35.375
ANGELES. THAT'S NOT EVEN

03:32:35.442 --> 03:32:39.313
COUNTING THE 100 BILLION PLUS

03:32:39.379 --> 03:32:40.547
THAT HAS BEEN GIFTED TO

03:32:40.614 --> 03:32:42.282
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT UNDER

03:32:42.349 --> 03:32:44.284
THE BIG BEAUTIFUL SCAM THAT IS

03:32:44.351 --> 03:32:46.220
MORE MONEY THAN MILITARIES

03:32:46.286 --> 03:32:49.189
AROUND THE WORLD. IN FACT, THAT

03:32:49.256 --> 03:32:51.258
IS A CENTURY'S WORTH OF

03:32:51.325 --> 03:32:53.360
HOMELESS SPENDING IN THE CITY

03:32:53.427 --> 03:32:55.796
OF LOS ANGELES. THAT'S WHAT WE

03:32:55.863 --> 03:32:58.365
JUST DID WITH THE BIG BEAUTIFUL

03:32:58.432 --> 03:32:59.633
SCAM THAT SHOWS WHERE OUR

03:32:59.700 --> 03:33:00.934
VALUES ARE. INSTEAD OF

03:33:01.001 --> 03:33:02.436
INVESTING IN CHILDCARE, INSTEAD

03:33:02.503 --> 03:33:03.904
OF INVESTING IN EDUCATION,

03:33:03.971 --> 03:33:06.406
INSTEAD OF INVESTING IN

03:33:06.473 --> 03:33:07.107
HEALTHCARE, INSTEAD OF KEEPING

03:33:07.174 --> 03:33:10.077
FAMILIES WHOLE. WE'VE INVESTED

03:33:10.144 --> 03:33:14.248
IN OUR OWN MILITARIZATION AND

03:33:14.314 --> 03:33:16.083
ARMY OF IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT

03:33:16.150 --> 03:33:17.918
PATROLLING OUR STREETS, AND

03:33:17.985 --> 03:33:19.086
IT'S ONLY FITTING THAT THIS

03:33:19.153 --> 03:33:21.421
RESOLUTION BE BROUGHT TODAY.

03:33:21.488 --> 03:33:22.623
AND I WANT TO THANK MY

03:33:22.689 --> 03:33:24.024
COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES, MY

03:33:24.091 --> 03:33:25.125
COLLEAGUES FROM LOS ANGELES,

03:33:25.192 --> 03:33:26.860
FOR BRINGING IT, BECAUSE A

03:33:26.927 --> 03:33:30.063
COURT JUST RULED THAT THE

03:33:30.130 --> 03:33:32.933
NATIONAL GUARD AND ICE ARE NOT

03:33:33.000 --> 03:33:35.235
THE PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL POLICE.

03:33:35.302 --> 03:33:38.071
HE IS NOT THE CHIEF OF

03:33:38.138 --> 03:33:40.807
AMERICA'S POLICE. HE WORKS FOR

03:33:40.874 --> 03:33:44.077
THE PEOPLE. HE WORKS FOR

03:33:44.144 --> 03:33:44.912
CALIFORNIANS. AT LEAST HE

03:33:44.978 --> 03:33:47.047
SHOULD. AND EVEN THOUGH HE

03:33:47.114 --> 03:33:48.949
WOULD DENY US OUR WILDFIRE AID,

03:33:49.016 --> 03:33:50.984
HE WOULD PUNISH OUR PUBLIC

03:33:51.051 --> 03:33:52.252
INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING.

03:33:52.319 --> 03:33:53.854
HE WOULD PUNISH THE 1 IN 8

03:33:53.921 --> 03:33:55.656
AMERICANS WHO JUST HAPPENED TO

03:33:55.722 --> 03:33:58.058
CALL CALIFORNIA HOME. WE HAVE A

03:33:58.125 --> 03:33:59.126
DIFFERENT RESPONSIBILITY, AND

03:33:59.193 --> 03:34:01.094
THAT RESPONSIBILITY IS TO DO

03:34:01.161 --> 03:34:02.930
EVERYTHING WE CAN. AND IN THESE

03:34:02.996 --> 03:34:05.399
FINAL TWO WEEKS OF SESSION,

03:34:05.465 --> 03:34:06.900
PASSING COR NINE IS ONE OF

03:34:06.967 --> 03:34:09.102
THOSE THINGS THAT WE ABSOLUTELY

03:34:09.169 --> 03:34:11.872
MUST DO. AND SHAME ON ANYBODY

03:34:11.939 --> 03:34:13.373
WHO DOESN'T MAKE THIS

03:34:13.440 --> 03:34:17.544
BIPARTISAN. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

03:34:17.611 --> 03:34:18.679
MEMBER BRIAN, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

03:34:18.745 --> 03:34:21.114
PATTERSON, YOU'RE RECOGNIZED.

03:34:21.181 --> 03:34:25.953
WELL, ON THAT NOTE, YOU KNOW, I,

03:34:26.019 --> 03:34:29.389
I HOPE I GET AS GOOD OF A WARM

03:34:29.456 --> 03:34:30.023
RECEPTION AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM

03:34:30.090 --> 03:34:33.060
SAN DIEGO RECEIVED ON HIS

03:34:33.126 --> 03:34:34.061
REMARKS, BUT MINE WILL BE

03:34:34.127 --> 03:34:36.597
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT, A LOT

03:34:36.663 --> 03:34:38.999
DIFFERENT. YOU KNOW, I'M GOING

03:34:39.066 --> 03:34:40.334
TO SAY SOMETHING THAT'S

03:34:40.400 --> 03:34:41.168
PROBABLY GOING TO MAKE

03:34:41.235 --> 03:34:43.570
EVERYBODY A LITTLE MAD AT ME.

03:34:43.637 --> 03:34:44.638
WHETHER YOU SUPPORT THIS

03:34:44.705 --> 03:34:47.140
RESOLUTION OR NOT. BUT, YOU

03:34:47.207 --> 03:34:48.909
KNOW, I WAS JUST THINKING, AS

03:34:48.976 --> 03:34:50.043
THIS DEBATE GOES ON, SOME

03:34:50.110 --> 03:34:51.845
THINGS THAT GO THROUGH MY MIND.

03:34:51.912 --> 03:34:54.081
SO I TRIED OUT HERE, YOU KNOW,

03:34:54.147 --> 03:34:55.449
I'M SURE NOBODY'S LISTENING.

03:34:55.515 --> 03:34:58.552
I'M SURE THIS WON'T BE AIRED

03:34:58.619 --> 03:35:00.787
ANYWHERE. BUT REALLY, MY GOAL

03:35:00.854 --> 03:35:02.055
WITH THIS DISCUSSION, WHICH I

03:35:02.122 --> 03:35:04.057
DON'T THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN,

03:35:04.124 --> 03:35:05.359
I KNOW IT'S VERY EMOTIONAL FOR

03:35:05.425 --> 03:35:06.960
A LOT OF PEOPLE, BUT WE HAVE TO

03:35:07.027 --> 03:35:09.196
TAKE DOWN THE TEMPERATURE, NOT

03:35:09.263 --> 03:35:10.797
JUST IN WHAT WE'RE DISCUSSING,

03:35:10.864 --> 03:35:13.800
BUT WE DO PLAY A ROLE HERE IN

03:35:13.867 --> 03:35:14.601
THE CALIFORNIA STATE

03:35:14.668 --> 03:35:16.536
LEGISLATURE ON ON WHERE THIS

03:35:16.603 --> 03:35:18.472
DISCUSSION AND HOW HIGH THE

03:35:18.538 --> 03:35:19.239
TEMPERATURE HAS GOTTEN. PEOPLE

03:35:19.306 --> 03:35:21.074
USED TO COME TO ME IN MY

03:35:21.141 --> 03:35:22.809
DISTRICT AND THEY USED TO ASK

03:35:22.876 --> 03:35:24.044
ME, PEOPLE STILL DO COME UP TO

03:35:24.111 --> 03:35:27.381
ME AND ASK ME THIS. THEY SAY,

03:35:27.447 --> 03:35:28.682
HOW DO I FEEL ABOUT ILLEGAL

03:35:28.749 --> 03:35:31.285
IMMIGRATION? WELL, YOU KNOW,

03:35:31.351 --> 03:35:34.955
GENERALLY I DON'T LIKE IT. AND

03:35:35.022 --> 03:35:37.124
IT'S CRAZY THAT I THINK IT'S

03:35:37.190 --> 03:35:38.825
CRAZY THAT WE HAVE A BORDER.

03:35:38.892 --> 03:35:40.127
YOU KNOW, I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY

03:35:40.193 --> 03:35:42.062
TO GO DOWN THERE WHERE

03:35:42.129 --> 03:35:43.563
LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

03:35:43.630 --> 03:35:44.131
OF PEOPLE A MONTH UNDER THE

03:35:44.197 --> 03:35:46.033
LAST ADMINISTRATION CAME INTO

03:35:46.099 --> 03:35:48.268
THIS COUNTRY FROM ONE SECTOR

03:35:48.335 --> 03:35:50.103
ALONE. WE HAVE NO IDEA WHO

03:35:50.170 --> 03:35:52.339
THOSE PEOPLE WERE. NO IDEAS. IN

03:35:52.406 --> 03:35:53.040
FACT, YOU CAN MAKE AN

03:35:53.106 --> 03:35:54.141
APPOINTMENT WITH THE BORDER

03:35:54.207 --> 03:35:56.143
PATROL TO COME IN TO THIS

03:35:56.209 --> 03:35:57.511
COUNTRY WITHOUT DOCUMENTS AND

03:35:57.577 --> 03:35:59.513
GET YOUR COURT DATE FOR SEVEN

03:35:59.579 --> 03:36:01.114
YEARS LATER. I'M SURE EVERYBODY

03:36:01.181 --> 03:36:02.949
WILL SHOW UP AT THOSE. AND I

03:36:03.016 --> 03:36:05.218
DIDN'T HEAR A PEEP ABOUT THIS

03:36:05.285 --> 03:36:07.421
IN THIS BODY THAT WE DIDN'T

03:36:07.487 --> 03:36:08.755
KNOW WHO THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE.

03:36:08.822 --> 03:36:10.357
MANY, BY THE WAY. NOT FROM

03:36:10.424 --> 03:36:11.958
MEXICO. I THINK MEXICO IS

03:36:12.025 --> 03:36:13.760
ACTUALLY THE NUMBER SIXTH

03:36:13.827 --> 03:36:15.028
COUNTRY ON THE PEOPLE COMING

03:36:15.095 --> 03:36:17.030
ACROSS FROM THE BORDER IN OUR

03:36:17.097 --> 03:36:18.198
SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE, NOT NUMBER

03:36:18.265 --> 03:36:19.966
ONE OR NUMBER TWO. IT WAS FROM

03:36:20.033 --> 03:36:21.101
OTHER COUNTRIES, BUT WE REALLY

03:36:21.168 --> 03:36:23.770
DON'T KNOW WHO THOSE

03:36:23.837 --> 03:36:24.371
INDIVIDUALS WERE BECAUSE SOME

03:36:24.438 --> 03:36:24.938
OF THOSE COUNTRIES WOULDN'T

03:36:25.005 --> 03:36:27.074
SHARE THE INFORMATION WITH US.

03:36:27.140 --> 03:36:29.343
BUT DESPITE ALL THIS, I'D STILL

03:36:29.409 --> 03:36:31.311
GIVE THE UNSATISFACTORY ANSWER

03:36:31.378 --> 03:36:32.979
TO MY CONSTITUENTS THAT I SAID,

03:36:33.046 --> 03:36:36.016
HEY, LOOK AT THE TIME. MY

03:36:36.083 --> 03:36:36.983
RESPONSE WAS, I'M NOT REALLY

03:36:37.050 --> 03:36:40.020
WORRIED ABOUT THE MEXICAN GUY,

03:36:40.087 --> 03:36:42.089
THE MEXICAN LADY WHO'S GOING TO

03:36:42.155 --> 03:36:45.058
WORK IN THE FIELDS EVERY DAY.

03:36:45.125 --> 03:36:46.393
THAT GUY OR LADY, THEY'D SEND

03:36:46.460 --> 03:36:48.028
THEIR KIDS OFF TO SCHOOL IN THE

03:36:48.095 --> 03:36:49.730
MORNING, GO WORK THEIR BUTTS

03:36:49.796 --> 03:36:51.331
OFF IN THE FIELDS SO THEY COULD

03:36:51.398 --> 03:36:54.234
PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. MOST OF

03:36:54.301 --> 03:36:56.503
WHAT I HAVE SEEN, THE MAJORITY

03:36:56.570 --> 03:36:57.504
OF AMERICANS AND CALIFORNIANS

03:36:57.571 --> 03:37:01.541
ARE SUPPORTIVE OF POLICIES TO

03:37:01.608 --> 03:37:03.110
PREVENT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.

03:37:03.176 --> 03:37:05.045
BUT WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT,

03:37:05.112 --> 03:37:06.980
AND I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND, IF

03:37:07.047 --> 03:37:08.348
WE STAND UP AND EXPRESS SOME

03:37:08.415 --> 03:37:09.082
CONCERNS ABOUT THE POLICIES

03:37:09.149 --> 03:37:10.984
THAT WE ADOPT IN THIS BODY, WE

03:37:11.051 --> 03:37:13.487
LOOKED AT AND WE SEE SOME OF IT

03:37:13.553 --> 03:37:14.988
HERE TODAY ABOUT HOW WE'RE SOME

03:37:15.055 --> 03:37:16.289
SORT OF RACIST OR SOMETHING

03:37:16.356 --> 03:37:18.091
LIKE THAT, BECAUSE WE EXPRESS

03:37:18.158 --> 03:37:19.926
CONCERNS. I REMEMBER BEING A

03:37:19.993 --> 03:37:21.461
STAFF PERSON, ACTUALLY. I WAS A

03:37:21.528 --> 03:37:23.730
NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR TO THE

03:37:23.797 --> 03:37:24.998
AUTHOR OF THIS BILL. INITIALLY.

03:37:25.065 --> 03:37:27.501
I REMEMBER THE DEBATE TOOK LIKE

03:37:27.567 --> 03:37:29.569
15 YEARS. DRIVER'S LICENSES FOR

03:37:29.636 --> 03:37:31.872
THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT IN

03:37:31.938 --> 03:37:36.276
THE COUNTRY LEGALLY. LATER ON,

03:37:36.343 --> 03:37:39.079
WE ALLOWED PEOPLE TO SET UP

03:37:39.146 --> 03:37:41.314
BUSINESSES, AND POLICE WERE NO

03:37:41.381 --> 03:37:42.082
LONGER ABLE TO INTERACT WITH

03:37:42.149 --> 03:37:44.284
THEM. SO THOSE INDIVIDUALS

03:37:44.351 --> 03:37:46.386
SELLING HOT DOGS, WHICH SEEMS

03:37:46.453 --> 03:37:50.190
KIND OF NOT REALLY A BIG DEAL.

03:37:50.257 --> 03:37:52.058
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BUSINESSES

03:37:52.125 --> 03:37:53.126
IN ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS THAT

03:37:53.193 --> 03:37:54.961
HAVE TO GO GET ALL THOSE

03:37:55.028 --> 03:37:56.129
PERMITS AND CAN'T EVEN AFFORD

03:37:56.196 --> 03:37:58.198
TO STAY OPEN IN THE FIRST PLACE?

03:37:58.265 --> 03:37:59.132
WE DON'T EVEN CONSIDER THAT IN

03:37:59.199 --> 03:38:00.167
THE DISCUSSIONS. BUT IF YOU

03:38:00.233 --> 03:38:02.102
DON'T SUPPORT THE BILL, YOU

03:38:02.169 --> 03:38:03.036
MUST BE AGAINST THE PERSON

03:38:03.103 --> 03:38:06.139
SELLING HOT DOGS. AND ON ITS

03:38:06.206 --> 03:38:07.874
FACE, WE JUST PASSED A

03:38:07.941 --> 03:38:09.276
RESOLUTION ABOUT THE

03:38:09.342 --> 03:38:10.310
INDIVIDUALS IN THE HOSPITALS.

03:38:10.377 --> 03:38:11.745
SHOULD THEY BE LEFT ALONE?

03:38:11.812 --> 03:38:13.113
PERHAPS I ACTUALLY ABSTAINED

03:38:13.180 --> 03:38:14.681
FROM THAT BILL BECAUSE

03:38:14.748 --> 03:38:15.949
GENERALLY SPEAKING, I THINK

03:38:16.016 --> 03:38:17.984
PRIVATE INFORMATION IS PRIVATE

03:38:18.051 --> 03:38:19.886
INFORMATION. BUT MAYBE THAT'S

03:38:19.953 --> 03:38:20.987
MAYBE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE IN

03:38:21.054 --> 03:38:23.190
THE HOSPITAL THAT WE SHOULD

03:38:23.256 --> 03:38:24.324
KNOW MORE ABOUT, BUT WE DON'T

03:38:24.391 --> 03:38:26.560
KNOW BECAUSE WE DON'T EVEN WANT

03:38:26.626 --> 03:38:27.961
TO ASK THE INFORMATION. IN FACT,

03:38:28.028 --> 03:38:29.429
WE WANT TO PROHIBIT GIVING THE

03:38:29.496 --> 03:38:30.030
INFORMATION ALTOGETHER. SO WE

03:38:30.096 --> 03:38:32.132
GAVE THE DRIVER'S LICENSES, WE

03:38:32.199 --> 03:38:34.201
ALLOWED THE HOT DOG VENDORS,

03:38:34.267 --> 03:38:38.538
AND WE ALSO ALLOW MEDI-CAL TO

03:38:38.605 --> 03:38:41.007
PEOPLE WHO WERE NÓ WERE NOT

03:38:41.074 --> 03:38:42.175
ELIGIBLE TO THE EXPENSE OF TENS

03:38:42.242 --> 03:38:43.944
OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR.

03:38:44.010 --> 03:38:45.145
AND WE DON'T EVEN PROVIDE

03:38:45.212 --> 03:38:47.314
PROPER CARE FOR THE FOR ANYBODY

03:38:47.380 --> 03:38:49.015
IN THE FIRST PLACE. WE DON'T

03:38:49.082 --> 03:38:51.751
HAVE PROVIDERS TO GIVE

03:38:51.818 --> 03:38:53.987
INDIVIDUALS MEDI-CAL, BUT WE'RE

03:38:54.054 --> 03:38:55.822
EXPANDING THE POOL BY MILLIONS

03:38:55.889 --> 03:38:58.024
OF PEOPLE. SO MY CONCERN WITH

03:38:58.091 --> 03:39:00.527
THIS IS 30S. THANK YOU, MR.

03:39:00.594 --> 03:39:04.064
SPEAKER, IS WE ARE A

03:39:04.130 --> 03:39:05.232
CONTRIBUTOR. YOU WANT TO TALK?

03:39:05.298 --> 03:39:07.000
SB 54 ISN'T RELEVANT. IT IS

03:39:07.067 --> 03:39:09.169
VERY RELEVANT BECAUSE WE ARE

03:39:09.236 --> 03:39:10.871
TELLING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT,

03:39:10.937 --> 03:39:12.138
AND MAYBE IT'S NOT THIS, MAYBE

03:39:12.205 --> 03:39:13.807
IT'S THIS ADMINISTRATION, MAYBE

03:39:13.874 --> 03:39:14.374
IT'S ANOTHER ADMINISTRATION.

03:39:14.441 --> 03:39:16.042
WHO KNOWS? BUT WE ARE TELLING

03:39:16.109 --> 03:39:17.177
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE

03:39:17.244 --> 03:39:18.845
ACTIVELY WILL OPPOSE YOU EVEN

03:39:18.912 --> 03:39:21.147
GOING TO GET THE CRIMINALS OUT

03:39:21.214 --> 03:39:23.350
OF OUR PRISONS. WE ARE TELLING

03:39:23.416 --> 03:39:25.085
THEM THAT. AND SO I THINK WE

03:39:25.151 --> 03:39:27.521
HAVE TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT WHEN

03:39:27.587 --> 03:39:28.588
WE ADOPT POLICIES IN THIS

03:39:28.655 --> 03:39:31.024
CHAMBER. THERE ARE EFFECTS THAT

03:39:31.091 --> 03:39:33.059
GO BEYOND, AND RATIONAL PEOPLE

03:39:33.126 --> 03:39:35.128
CAN HAVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS

03:39:35.195 --> 03:39:37.097
WITHOUT BEING FROWNED UPON OR

03:39:37.163 --> 03:39:41.134
GETTING A NOT SO WARM RECEPTION.

03:39:41.201 --> 03:39:42.869
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR.

03:39:42.936 --> 03:39:45.705
SPEAKER. ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

03:39:45.772 --> 03:39:46.473
PATTERSON, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

03:39:46.540 --> 03:39:50.477
ORTEGA, YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

03:39:50.544 --> 03:39:52.445
THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. AND

03:39:52.512 --> 03:39:56.550
COLLEAGUES, AS A WOMAN OF FAITH,

03:39:56.616 --> 03:40:00.787
I WILL RISE IN SUPPORT OF SJ

03:40:00.854 --> 03:40:05.258
NINE AND I WILL PRAY FOR MY

03:40:05.325 --> 03:40:08.795
COLLEAGUES, ESPECIALLY MY

03:40:08.862 --> 03:40:13.133
COLLEAGUE FROM CLOVIS. I AM

03:40:13.199 --> 03:40:17.437
SORRY THAT YOU HATE YOUR FATHER.

03:40:17.504 --> 03:40:21.041
BECAUSE I DO NOT HATE MINE.

03:40:21.107 --> 03:40:24.277
MINE CAME TO THIS COUNTRY

03:40:24.344 --> 03:40:26.913
LOOKING FOR A BETTER LIFE FOR

03:40:26.980 --> 03:40:29.449
HIS FAMILY, LOOKING FOR THE

03:40:29.516 --> 03:40:31.985
AMERICAN DREAM. I AM PROUD TO

03:40:32.052 --> 03:40:36.923
SAY HIS NAME. PROSPERO ORTEGA,

03:40:36.990 --> 03:40:40.360
WHO BROUGHT ME HERE AS A THREE

03:40:40.427 --> 03:40:43.430
YEAR OLD WITH MY MOTHER AND

03:40:43.496 --> 03:40:45.899
BROTHER, AND WHOSE ONLY CRIME

03:40:45.966 --> 03:40:50.537
WAS TO COME TO THIS COUNTRY IN

03:40:50.604 --> 03:40:52.038
SEARCH OF THAT DREAM AND TO

03:40:52.105 --> 03:40:54.908
CONTRIBUTE TO IT. SO I WILL

03:40:54.975 --> 03:40:58.878
PRAY FOR MY COLLEAGUES WHOSE

03:40:58.945 --> 03:41:01.214
SIGHT AND CLAIM TO LOVE OUR

03:41:01.281 --> 03:41:03.950
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES, BUT

03:41:04.017 --> 03:41:06.820
ENCOURAGE THE DISAPPEARANCE OF

03:41:06.886 --> 03:41:09.589
OUR CHILDREN, OUR MOTHERS, AND

03:41:09.656 --> 03:41:13.026
OUR FATHERS MEMBERS. AS WE

03:41:13.093 --> 03:41:16.429
STATED BEFORE, THESE RAIDS ARE

03:41:16.496 --> 03:41:19.399
NOT ABOUT GOING AFTER CRIMINALS.

03:41:19.466 --> 03:41:21.267
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT

03:41:21.334 --> 03:41:23.837
TARGETING OUR VULNERABLE

03:41:23.903 --> 03:41:26.006
COMMUNITIES, ESPECIALLY PEOPLE

03:41:26.072 --> 03:41:29.476
WHO LOOK LIKE US. AND YES, IT'S

03:41:29.542 --> 03:41:32.812
BEEN ABOUT RACIAL PROFILING.

03:41:32.879 --> 03:41:36.750
BECAUSE THINK ABOUT THIS IF WE

03:41:36.816 --> 03:41:38.818
ARE CRIMINALS AND WE ARE DOING

03:41:38.885 --> 03:41:42.188
IT THE RIGHT WAY, WHY WOULD WE

03:41:42.255 --> 03:41:45.091
WALK INTO A FEDERAL BUILDING,

03:41:45.158 --> 03:41:49.729
GO THROUGH SECURITY, PULL A

03:41:49.796 --> 03:41:55.402
NUMBER AND ASK TO BE SEEN?

03:41:55.468 --> 03:41:56.269
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT IS WHAT IS

03:41:56.336 --> 03:42:01.808
HAPPENING. AND THE FACT IS, 70%

03:42:01.875 --> 03:42:04.044
OF THE CURRENT DAY TÍNH

03:42:04.110 --> 03:42:05.912
DETAINEES BY ICE HAVE NO

03:42:05.979 --> 03:42:12.285
CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS. BUT

03:42:12.352 --> 03:42:18.358
HISTORY HAS SHOWN US. THAT MASS

03:42:18.425 --> 03:42:19.993
DEPORTATIONS, WHETHER IT WAS

03:42:20.060 --> 03:42:23.463
THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT,

03:42:23.530 --> 03:42:26.466
OPERATION OR MEXICAN

03:42:26.533 --> 03:42:27.801
REPARATIONS, WERE NOT ABOUT

03:42:27.867 --> 03:42:31.671
SAFETY OR JUSTICE. THERE WERE

03:42:31.738 --> 03:42:34.974
ALWAYS ABOUT SCAPEGOATING OUR

03:42:35.041 --> 03:42:37.877
COMMUNITIES FOR LARGER ISSUES.

03:42:37.944 --> 03:42:42.482
WITH THAT, LET'S DO WHAT THE

03:42:42.549 --> 03:42:45.051
STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND HISTORY

03:42:45.118 --> 03:42:47.887
HAS TAUGHT US, AND THAT IS THAT

03:42:47.954 --> 03:42:53.159
WE DEMAND ACTION. AND I

03:42:53.226 --> 03:42:54.360
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE

03:42:54.427 --> 03:42:57.197
VOTE ON S¼ NINE. THANK YOU.

03:42:57.263 --> 03:42:59.966
ASSEMBLY MEMBER ORTEGA, SEEING

03:43:00.033 --> 03:43:01.534
AND HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE.

03:43:01.601 --> 03:43:02.702
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ, DO

03:43:02.769 --> 03:43:04.904
YOU WISH TO CLOSE? THANK YOU,

03:43:04.971 --> 03:43:06.106
MR. SPEAKER. AND THANK YOU TO

03:43:06.172 --> 03:43:08.141
ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES THAT ROSE

03:43:08.208 --> 03:43:08.975
IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION

03:43:09.042 --> 03:43:11.377
FROM ALL OVER THE STATE. THIS

03:43:11.444 --> 03:43:12.345
IS NOT ABOUT WELCOMING

03:43:12.412 --> 03:43:15.014
IMMIGRANTS. THIS IS ABOUT THE

03:43:15.081 --> 03:43:17.083
KIDNAPING OF OUR IMMIGRANT

03:43:17.150 --> 03:43:18.918
COMMUNITIES. AS PASSED,

03:43:18.985 --> 03:43:20.820
CALIFORNIA PASSED SB 54 TO KEEP

03:43:20.887 --> 03:43:22.322
OUR FAMILIES SAFE FROM THE

03:43:22.388 --> 03:43:24.190
TERROR OF THE ICE RAIDS. YET

03:43:24.257 --> 03:43:26.092
TODAY, WE FACE A CONVICTED

03:43:26.159 --> 03:43:27.093
FELON IN THE WHITE HOUSE THAT

03:43:27.160 --> 03:43:29.095
DOESN'T PLAY BY THE RULES, BUT

03:43:29.162 --> 03:43:31.798
INSTEAD TRIES TO REWRITE THEM,

03:43:31.865 --> 03:43:33.566
ABUSING HIS POWER TO WEAPONIZE

03:43:33.633 --> 03:43:35.902
OUR NATIONAL GUARD AGAINST US.

03:43:35.969 --> 03:43:38.171
AND I WANT TO EDUCATE A COUPLE

03:43:38.238 --> 03:43:39.105
OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO SPOKE ON

03:43:39.172 --> 03:43:40.907
THE FLOOR TODAY FROM MY

03:43:40.974 --> 03:43:42.242
COLLEAGUE FROM ROCKLIN, BROTHER,

03:43:42.308 --> 03:43:44.244
WE DON'T JUST SELL HOT DOGS. WE

03:43:44.310 --> 03:43:45.912
DO A LOT MORE TO MY COLLEAGUE

03:43:45.979 --> 03:43:47.180
FROM SAN DIEGO. I WANT TO

03:43:47.247 --> 03:43:49.249
EDUCATE YOU AS WELL. SAN DIEGO

03:43:49.315 --> 03:43:51.251
WAS NAMED BY A SAINT, SAN DIEGO

03:43:51.317 --> 03:43:53.753
DE ALCALA, NOT FOR CRUELTY OR

03:43:53.820 --> 03:43:55.188
DIVISION. SO I FIND IT IRONIC

03:43:55.255 --> 03:43:57.157
THAT A REPRESENTATIVE FROM A

03:43:57.223 --> 03:43:58.124
CITY BORN OF COMPASSION AND

03:43:58.191 --> 03:43:59.225
FAITH WOULD STAND THERE

03:43:59.292 --> 03:44:00.960
DEFENDING A CONVICTED FELON IN

03:44:01.027 --> 03:44:01.961
THE WHITE HOUSE WHO PREYS ON

03:44:02.028 --> 03:44:04.330
FAMILIES INSTEAD OF PROTECTING

03:44:04.397 --> 03:44:06.332
THEM. AND TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM

03:44:06.399 --> 03:44:09.068
CLOVIS, IT SAYS A LOT WHEN A

03:44:09.135 --> 03:44:10.303
REPUBLICAN FROM CLOVIS, A CITY

03:44:10.370 --> 03:44:12.272
THAT CALLS ITSELF THE GATEWAY

03:44:12.338 --> 03:44:13.072
TO THE SIERRAS, CHOOSES TO BE

03:44:13.139 --> 03:44:14.574
THE GATEWAY FOR TRUMP'S

03:44:14.641 --> 03:44:16.142
CONVICTED CORRUPTION INSTEAD OF

03:44:16.209 --> 03:44:17.977
THE GATEWAY TO JUSTICE. AND

03:44:18.044 --> 03:44:19.579
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

03:44:19.646 --> 03:44:20.880
POLYNESIANS ARE INDIGENOUS TO

03:44:20.947 --> 03:44:23.483
POLYNESIA. BUT WHEN THEY MOVE

03:44:23.550 --> 03:44:25.451
OUTSIDE THEIR ANCESTRAL ISLANDS,

03:44:25.518 --> 03:44:26.986
THEY MAY BE CONSIDERED

03:44:27.053 --> 03:44:29.622
IMMIGRANTS. THIS LAND WAS ONCE

03:44:29.689 --> 03:44:31.991
MEXICO, AND LONG BEFORE THAT IT

03:44:32.058 --> 03:44:33.827
WAS HOME TO INDIGENOUS PEOPLES,

03:44:33.893 --> 03:44:34.928
OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR

03:44:34.994 --> 03:44:37.030
FAMILIES AND OUR NEIGHBORS ARE

03:44:37.096 --> 03:44:39.933
NOT INVADERS. THEY BELONG HERE,

03:44:39.999 --> 03:44:44.003
JUST AS WE ALL DO. IF YOU STAND

03:44:44.070 --> 03:44:45.805
WITH OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES

03:44:45.872 --> 03:44:47.807
AND AGAINST THIS WANNABE KING,

PLEASE VOTE AYE FOR THIS

03:44:51.244 --> 03:44:51.911

INNOCENT CHILDREN, PARENTS,

03:44:53.112 --> 03:44:55.114
FAMILIES, AND THOSE TO KNOW

03:44:55.181 --> 03:44:56.916
THAT THEY HAVE ALLIES IN

03:44:56.983 --> 03:44:58.117
CALIFORNIA AND THE VOICE IN

03:44:58.184 --> 03:44:59.886
THIS CHAMBER, PLEASE VOTE AYE.

03:44:59.953 --> 03:45:02.021
IF YOU BELIEVE IN THE SIMPLE

03:45:02.088 --> 03:45:03.256
HUMANITY THAT THESE RATES THROW

03:45:03.323 --> 03:45:05.825

VOTE AYE ON THIS RESOLUTION,

03:45:09.429 --> 03:45:10.997

03:45:11.064 --> 03:45:13.733
CHILDREN LEFT BEHIND AND TELL

03:45:13.800 --> 03:45:15.935
THEM WHY COLLEAGUES VOTE YES ON

S¼ NINE. DO IT WITH COURAGE. DO

03:45:18.838 --> 03:45:19.472
IT WITH CONVICTION. BECAUSE

WHEN WE DEFEND THE MOST

03:45:21.174 --> 03:45:22.642
VULNERABLE, WE DEFEND OUR

03:45:22.709 --> 03:45:24.377

CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. AND I

03:45:28.915 --> 03:45:30.416

INTRODUCTION TO DO ON BEHALF OF

ABOUT WHETHER WE VALUE OUR

IMMIGRANT STUDENTS IN THOSE

03:52:31.304 --> 03:52:33.306
PUBLIC SCHOOLS FAILED. THE

MANAGER OF THIS BILL HAS

03:52:42.982 --> 03:52:44.150
ANOTHER BILL THAT WOULD

03:52:44.216 --> 03:52:45.851
UNDERCUT THE EDUCATIONAL

03:52:45.918 --> 03:52:47.420

THIS LEGISLATION. THIS

03:53:03.869 --> 03:53:06.072
LEGISLATION IS DESIGNED TO

03:53:06.138 --> 03:53:07.940
DISTRACT FROM THE COLOSSAL

03:53:08.007 --> 03:53:11.077
FAILURE OF THIS LEGISLATURE,

03:53:11.143 --> 03:53:13.546
BECAUSE WE'VE NOT PROVIDED YOU

03:53:13.612 --> 03:53:15.281

DEMAIO, YOU MAY CONTINUE YOUR

03:53:46.278 --> 03:53:48.247
FLOOR SPEECH. MY REMARKS

03:53:48.314 --> 03:53:50.049
REGARDING THE LACK OF

03:53:50.116 --> 03:53:51.150
LEADERSHIP AND THE LACK OF

03:53:51.217 --> 03:53:53.085
PERFORMANCE OF THIS LEGISLATURE

03:53:53.152 --> 03:53:55.020
IN PROVIDING A QUALITY

03:53:55.087 --> 03:53:56.722
EDUCATION FOR SCHOOLS THAT

03:53:56.789 --> 03:53:59.325
SERVE IMMIGRANT STUDENTS, IS

03:53:59.392 --> 03:54:01.527
EXACTLY ON POINT, BECAUSE THIS

03:54:01.594 --> 03:54:03.596
RESOLUTION, THE FALSEHOODS, THE

03:54:03.662 --> 03:54:06.565
DIVISION. IT'S ONLY DESIGNED TO

03:54:06.632 --> 03:54:07.466
DISTRACT FROM YOUR COLOSSAL

03:54:07.533 --> 03:54:09.635
FAILURE. YOU HAVE NOT PROVIDED

03:54:09.702 --> 03:54:10.970
A QUALITY EDUCATION FOR THESE

03:54:11.036 --> 03:54:14.106
IMMIGRANT FAMILIES. AND THAT'S

03:54:14.173 --> 03:54:16.008
WHY I DON'T URGE A YES VOTE ON

03:54:16.075 --> 03:54:18.778
THIS BILL. NOT ONLY IS IT

03:54:18.844 --> 03:54:19.979
DIVISIVE, BUT IT IS EXACTLY THE

03:54:20.045 --> 03:54:22.081
SORT OF GAME THAT TRIES TO GET

03:54:22.148 --> 03:54:23.883
YOU OFF THE HOOK FOR FAILING TO

03:54:23.949 --> 03:54:25.518
PROVIDE QUALITY EDUCATION FOR

03:54:25.584 --> 03:54:27.486
THESE IMMIGRANT FAMILIES. YEAH,

03:54:27.553 --> 03:54:28.554
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A

03:54:28.621 --> 03:54:29.188
CONVERSATION IN THE NEXT YEAR,

03:54:29.255 --> 03:54:32.491
IN THE UPCOMING MONTHS AS TO

03:54:32.558 --> 03:54:33.359
WHO'S REALLY STANDING UP AND

03:54:33.426 --> 03:54:35.628
PUTTING THE INTERESTS OF

03:54:35.694 --> 03:54:37.463
IMMIGRANTS. FIRST OF ALL,

03:54:37.530 --> 03:54:39.999
CALIFORNIANS FIRST, WHEN YOU

03:54:40.065 --> 03:54:41.233
PROVIDE THEM WITH A HIGH COST

03:54:41.300 --> 03:54:42.134
OF LIVING, WHEN YOU PROVIDE

03:54:42.201 --> 03:54:44.403
THEM WITH FAILING SCHOOLS, YOU

03:54:44.470 --> 03:54:45.304
DON'T SERVE THE STUDENTS THAT

03:54:45.371 --> 03:54:47.206
YOU CLAIM TO BE PROTECTING WITH

03:54:47.273 --> 03:54:48.207
THIS RESOLUTION. THIS

03:54:48.274 --> 03:54:50.075
RESOLUTION IS NOTHING BUT A

03:54:50.142 --> 03:54:51.110
SMOKESCREEN. AND I DON'T THINK

03:54:51.177 --> 03:54:53.045
MANY OF THE IMMIGRANT PARENTS

03:54:53.112 --> 03:54:55.347
ARE GOING TO FALL FOR IT. THEY

03:54:55.414 --> 03:54:55.981
REALIZE THAT THEIR STUDENTS ARE

03:54:56.048 --> 03:54:57.183
NOT BEING PROVIDED WITH A

03:54:57.249 --> 03:54:59.185
QUALITY EDUCATION. MR. MR.

03:54:59.251 --> 03:55:01.053
DEMAYO, EXCUSE ME, ASSEMBLY

03:55:01.120 --> 03:55:02.154

03:55:02.221 --> 03:55:04.423
RECOGNIZED. YEAH. RESPECTFULLY,

03:55:04.490 --> 03:55:05.090
AS WE REMIND THE MEMBER THAT

03:55:05.157 --> 03:55:07.827
THIS IS NOT A RESOLUTION. IT IS

03:55:07.893 --> 03:55:09.495
AN ASSEMBLY BILL, AND HE'S NOT

03:55:09.562 --> 03:55:10.629
HOLDING A RESOLUTION. HE IS

03:55:10.696 --> 03:55:13.232
HOLDING A RANDOM PIECE OF PAPER.

03:55:13.299 --> 03:55:14.099
THANK YOU, ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

03:55:14.166 --> 03:55:17.703
BRIAN, ASSEMBLY MEMBER DEMAIO,

03:55:17.770 --> 03:55:20.473
YOU MAY CONTINUE WHEN YOU DON'T

03:55:20.539 --> 03:55:22.274
LIKE WHAT SOMEONE'S SAYING. YOU

03:55:22.341 --> 03:55:25.010
PLAY GAMES LIKE THIS BECAUSE

03:55:25.077 --> 03:55:26.712
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING HAS

03:55:26.779 --> 03:55:28.481
MERIT, AND YOU'RE AFRAID THAT

03:55:28.547 --> 03:55:30.115
CALIFORNIANS WILL ACTUALLY HEAR

03:55:30.182 --> 03:55:33.319
IT AND UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT I

03:55:33.385 --> 03:55:36.355
AM SAYING IS TRUE. IT IS YOUR

03:55:36.422 --> 03:55:38.424
FAILED RECORD THAT IS HURTING

03:55:38.491 --> 03:55:39.492
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES IN OUR

03:55:39.558 --> 03:55:42.261
STATE. NO AMOUNT OF FALSEHOODS

03:55:42.328 --> 03:55:44.897
OR DIVISION OR FEAR MONGERING

03:55:44.964 --> 03:55:46.966
WILL CHANGE THE FACT THAT YOU
