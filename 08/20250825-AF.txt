FUTURE OF HUMANITY. IN A TIME

00:49:36.006 --> 00:49:38.275
WHEN WEAPONS OF MASS

00:49:38.342 --> 00:49:40.043
DESTRUCTION CAN LITERALLY END

00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:42.245
LIFE AS WE KNOW IT. I WORRY

00:49:42.312 --> 00:49:44.314
WHEN SENSING GROWING GLOBAL

00:49:44.381 --> 00:49:47.117
TENSION AND CONFLICT, WILL WE

CONSEQUENCES ARE FORGOTTEN AND

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:53.323
HATE PREVAILS? HOW CAN WE MOVE

AWAY FROM WORLD WARS AND

00:49:55.192 --> 00:49:58.729

THIS, HIS HOLINESS THE DALAI

LAMA HAS SAID WE CAN NEVER

00:50:02.466 --> 00:50:05.135
OBTAIN PEACE IN THE WORLD IF WE

00:50:05.202 --> 00:50:07.003
NEGLECT THE INNER WORLD AND

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:09.406
DON'T MAKE PEACE WITH OURSELVES.

00:50:09.473 --> 00:50:11.942
WORLD PEACE MUST DEVELOP OUT OF

00:50:12.008 --> 00:50:15.512
INNER PEACE. HE THEN ADDED,

00:50:15.579 --> 00:50:17.481
WEAPONS THEMSELVES CANNOT ACT.

00:50:17.547 --> 00:50:20.584

00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:22.386
GIVEN THOSE WEAPONS, THOSE

00:50:22.452 --> 00:50:24.221
TERRIBLE WEAPONS, THEY CAN ACT,

00:50:24.287 --> 00:50:27.257

00:50:27.324 --> 00:50:28.392
LONG AS THEY ARE LEFT IN

00:50:28.458 --> 00:50:31.027
STORAGE, THEY CAN DO NO HARM. A

HUMAN BEING MUST USE THEM.

00:50:33.263 --> 00:50:35.365

00:50:35.432 --> 00:50:37.501
EVIL POWERS CANNOT PUSH THE

00:50:37.567 --> 00:50:40.804
BUTTON. HUMAN BEINGS MUST DO IT.

00:50:40.871 --> 00:50:43.306
CONTINUING DOWN A CONTENTIOUS

00:50:43.373 --> 00:50:45.108
PATH WILL LEAD TO ANGER, AND

00:50:45.175 --> 00:50:47.344
ANGER GROWS EASILY INTO HATE

00:50:47.411 --> 00:50:50.147
AND RAGE. THE CONSEQUENCES OF

00:50:50.213 --> 00:50:53.016
RAGE ARE RARELY GOOD. IN

FERNANDO VALENZUELA'S JOURNEY

01:43:56.096 --> 01:43:59.166
IS NOTHING SHORT OF REMARKABLE.

01:43:59.232 --> 01:44:02.202
HE WAS BORN IN SONORA, MEXICO,

01:44:02.269 --> 01:44:05.339
A TINY FARMING VILLAGE SO

01:44:05.405 --> 01:44:07.307
REMOTE THAT VIN SCULLY ONCE

01:44:07.374 --> 01:44:10.043
CALLED IT FROM THE BACK AND

01:44:10.110 --> 01:44:12.279
BEYOND. FERNANDO WAS THE

YOUNGEST OF 12 CHILDREN RAISED

01:44:14.681 --> 01:44:18.719
BY HARD WORKING FARMERS. LIKE

01:44:18.785 --> 01:44:19.286
MANY KIDS IN THE REGION, HE

01:44:19.353 --> 01:44:21.421
FIRST LEARNED AND PRACTICED

01:44:27.027 --> 01:44:29.196
HIS FATHER WAS A FARMER AND THE

01:44:29.262 --> 01:44:31.331
FAMILY HAD LIMITED RESOURCES,

01:44:31.398 --> 01:44:33.567
SO VALENZUELA OFTEN PRACTICED

01:44:33.634 --> 01:44:35.969
WITH IMPROVISED EQUIPMENT USING

01:44:36.036 --> 01:44:38.105

01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:41.375
ORGANIZED LOCAL LEAGUES.

01:44:41.441 --> 01:44:44.544
FERNANDO LOVED TO PLAY WITH HIS

01:44:44.611 --> 01:44:45.445
OLDER BROTHERS AND WAS OFTEN

01:44:45.512 --> 01:44:47.314

HIGH SCHOOL. PREPPINESS AND

01:45:24.818 --> 01:45:27.521
PUNK ROCK WERE POPULAR, AND THE

01:45:27.587 --> 01:45:30.957
DUKES OF HAZZARD WERE A BIG HIT.

01:45:31.024 --> 01:45:32.325
THE COUNTRY WAS ALSO STRUGGLING

01:45:32.392 --> 01:45:35.662
WITH INFLATION, RECESSION AND A

01:45:35.729 --> 01:45:37.230
BASEBALL STRIKE THAT HAD SHUT

DOWN PART OF THE SEASON. THE

01:45:39.566 --> 01:45:42.536
DODGERS NEEDED A SPARK. INTO

01:45:42.602 --> 01:45:44.071
THE MOMENT STEPPED A 20 YEAR

01:45:44.137 --> 01:45:47.274
OLD ROOKIE WITH A HIGH LEG KICK,

01:45:47.340 --> 01:45:50.010

01:45:52.245 --> 01:45:55.415

01:46:06.893 --> 01:46:10.263
BEST HITTERS IN THE GAME. BUT

01:46:10.330 --> 01:46:12.232
THE STORY WAS BIGGER THAN THE

01:46:12.299 --> 01:46:14.868
NUMBERS. IT WAS ABOUT THE

01:46:14.935 --> 01:46:17.370
PEOPLE. DODGER STADIUM

01:46:17.437 --> 01:46:19.539

01:49:56.122 --> 01:49:59.259
ROLE IN OUR CULTURE. WITH FIVE

01:49:59.326 --> 01:50:01.227
ICONIC MAJOR LEAGUE TEAMS. NÓ

01:50:07.267 --> 01:50:09.035
PLAYER EMBODIED THAT SPIRIT

01:50:09.102 --> 01:50:11.404
MORE THAN FERNANDO VALENZUELA.

01:50:11.471 --> 01:50:13.740
AS SOMEONE WHO GREW UP LOVING

ONE OF THE MOST BELOVED FIGURES

01:50:25.385 --> 01:50:27.988
IN BASEBALL HISTORY. WHEN IT

01:50:28.054 --> 01:50:30.090
COMES TO SPORTS, BASEBALL

01:50:30.156 --> 01:50:31.791
STANDS TALL AS AMERICA'S

BRING HOME THE WIN. THAT'S

01:50:52.579 --> 01:50:56.683
RIGHT, I SAID IT. BUT TRUE TO

01:50:56.750 --> 01:50:59.519
AMERICA, EVERY OTHER GENERATION

01:50:59.586 --> 01:51:02.389
OR SO A PERSON COMES ALONG WHO

01:51:02.455 --> 01:51:04.557
PERSONIFIES THE AMERICAN DREAM

01:51:04.624 --> 01:51:08.795
IN A VERY SPECIAL WAY. FERNANDO

01:51:08.862 --> 01:51:10.630
VALENZUELA TRANSCENDED BASEBALL.

01:51:10.697 --> 01:51:13.500
HE BECAME A CULTURAL ICON IN

01:51:13.566 --> 01:51:16.436
LOS ANGELES AND AMONG LATINO

01:51:16.503 --> 01:51:17.670
COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE UNITED

01:51:17.737 --> 01:51:20.040
STATES. HIS SUCCESS INSPIRED

01:51:20.106 --> 01:51:22.909
MILLIONS AND OPENED DOORS FOR

01:51:22.976 --> 01:51:25.478
MANY LATIN AMERICAN PLAYERS AND

01:51:25.545 --> 01:51:30.250
FANS. AND IN THAT VEIN, DODGER

01:51:30.316 --> 01:51:32.085
BASEBALL ENCAPSULATES ALL THAT

01:51:32.152 --> 01:51:34.187
IS BASEBALL IN AMERICA AND

01:51:34.254 --> 01:51:36.656
PERHAPS ALL THAT IS AMERICA FOR

01:51:36.723 --> 01:51:38.224
ITS CITIZENS. MAKE NO MISTAKE,

01:51:38.291 --> 01:51:40.060
THE DIAMOND AT DODGER STADIUM

01:51:40.126 --> 01:51:43.096
IS A WORLDLY STAGE IN TIME.

01:51:43.163 --> 01:51:44.931
WHEN WE ARE IN A TIME WHEN WE

01:51:44.998 --> 01:51:46.166
ARE EXPERIENCING SO MUCH

01:51:46.232 --> 01:51:47.333
CONFLICT AND DIVISION, ONE

01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:49.436
PERSON ON A BASEBALL FIELD CAN

01:51:49.502 --> 01:51:52.138
HELP BRING US TOGETHER. WE SEE

01:51:52.205 --> 01:51:53.740
THIS EVEN TODAY WITH SHOHEI

01:51:53.807 --> 01:51:55.108
OHTANI AND HIS TALENTS ON THE

01:51:55.175 --> 01:51:57.277
FIELD, NATIONS WILL FOLLOW A

01:51:57.343 --> 01:52:00.180
STAR MAKING HIS MARK IN DODGER

01:52:00.246 --> 01:52:03.083
BLUE. IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO

01:52:03.149 --> 01:52:04.417
THAT ONE PERSON EXEMPLIFIED

01:52:04.484 --> 01:52:06.653
THIS PHENOMENON AND SHOWCASED

01:52:06.719 --> 01:52:08.521
HIS TALENTS IN DODGER STADIUM.

01:52:08.588 --> 01:52:10.490
AS MUCH AS FERNANDO

01:52:10.557 --> 01:52:11.391
VALENZUELA'S TALENTS BROUGHT

01:52:11.458 --> 01:52:13.660
FANS TOGETHER, THEY ALSO PAID

01:52:13.726 --> 01:52:15.762
TRIBUTE TO THE SACRIFICES MADE

01:52:15.829 --> 01:52:17.163
BY THE RESIDENTS OF THE CHAVEZ

01:52:17.230 --> 01:52:19.632
RAVINE. THERE IS NO IRONY THAT

01:52:19.699 --> 01:52:22.202
FERNANDO, CHASING GREATNESS IN

01:52:22.268 --> 01:52:24.237
THE DODGER STADIUM. THIS WAS

01:52:24.304 --> 01:52:26.072
SIMPLY A HOMECOMING OF TALENT

01:52:26.139 --> 01:52:29.209
TO A STORIED LAND. WHEN LOS

01:52:29.275 --> 01:52:31.044
ANGELES NEEDED A STAR, FERNANDO

01:52:31.111 --> 01:52:33.379
ANSWERED THE CALL. FERNANDO WAS

01:52:33.446 --> 01:52:35.148
NOT ONLY A THREAT ON THE MOUND,

01:52:35.215 --> 01:52:37.784
BUT HE WAS ALSO A THREAT AT THE

01:52:37.851 --> 01:52:40.053
PLATE, WHO WAS USED AS A PINCH

01:52:40.120 --> 01:52:41.754
HITTER AND HAD TEN CAREER HOME

01:52:41.821 --> 01:52:44.657
RUNS. FERNANDO SHOWED US THAT A

01:52:44.724 --> 01:52:46.493
DEFENSIVE PLAYER COULD ALSO BE

01:52:46.559 --> 01:52:48.161
AN OFFENSIVE PLAYER. THIS MAY

01:52:48.228 --> 01:52:50.296
NOT BE THE MOST IMPORTANT

01:52:50.363 --> 01:52:51.764
LESSON THAT WE CAN TAKE FROM

01:52:51.831 --> 01:52:53.500
SUCH AN ICONIC FIGURE. NOT ONLY

01:52:53.566 --> 01:52:56.469
MUST WE PLAY DEFENSE, BUT WE

01:52:56.536 --> 01:52:58.004
MUST ALSO BE PREPARED TO

01:52:58.071 --> 01:53:01.608
SHOWCASE OUR OFFENSIVE STRENGTH.

01:53:01.674 --> 01:53:03.543
FERNANDO PLAYED 17 MAJOR LEAGUE

01:53:03.610 --> 01:53:05.111
SEASONS PITCHING AND BATTING AS

01:53:05.178 --> 01:53:06.746
A LEFT HANDER WITH AN

01:53:06.813 --> 01:53:08.148
UNORTHODOX STYLE. HE WAS

01:53:08.214 --> 01:53:11.017
NICKNAMED EL TORO. FERNANDO

01:53:11.084 --> 01:53:13.520
MADE HISTORY AS THE FIRST

01:53:13.586 --> 01:53:14.754
ROOKIE TO START OPENING DAY FOR

01:53:14.821 --> 01:53:17.123
THE DODGERS. HE WON HIS FIRST

01:53:17.190 --> 01:53:18.958
EIGHT STARTS, FIVE OF THEM

01:53:19.025 --> 01:53:21.561
SHUTOUTS, GOING ON TO WIN BOTH

01:53:21.628 --> 01:53:23.530
THE NATIONAL LEAGUE CY YOUNG

01:53:23.596 --> 01:53:25.565
AWARD AND ROOKIE OF THE YEAR IN

01:53:25.632 --> 01:53:28.268
THE SAME SEASON. A FIRST, AND

01:53:28.334 --> 01:53:30.303
STILL THE ONLY TIME IT HAS EVER

01:53:30.370 --> 01:53:32.372
BEEN DONE. NOT TO MENTION THE

01:53:32.438 --> 01:53:34.007
DODGERS ALSO WON THE WORLD

01:53:34.073 --> 01:53:36.276
SERIES THAT DAY. AND SO

01:53:36.342 --> 01:53:39.145
FERNANDO MANIA SWEPT THE NATION.

01:53:39.212 --> 01:53:42.315
LET US TAKE THIS MOMENT TO BE

01:53:42.382 --> 01:53:44.284
IN THE MOMENT, TO EXPERIENCE

01:53:44.350 --> 01:53:46.452
FERNANDO MANIA HERE IN THE

01:53:46.519 --> 01:53:48.254
CAPITAL AND WONDER OF THE YEARS

01:53:48.321 --> 01:53:50.490
WHEN AN UNORTHODOX PLAYER

01:53:50.557 --> 01:53:51.991
PITCHING A SCREWBALL FROM THE

01:53:52.058 --> 01:53:53.660
LEFT SIDE AND LOOKING TOWARD

01:53:53.726 --> 01:53:55.395
THE SKIES BEFORE EACH DELIVERY,

01:53:55.461 --> 01:53:57.497
CARRIED THE GREAT CITY OF LOS

01:53:57.564 --> 01:53:59.532

01:53:59.599 --> 01:54:01.134

THOSE OF US WHO GREW UP WITH

01:54:37.103 --> 01:54:39.105
MEXICAN ROOTS AND DODGER FANS,

01:54:39.172 --> 01:54:40.306
FERNANDO WAS MORE THAN A

01:54:40.373 --> 01:54:41.174
PITCHER. HE WAS A SYMBOL OF

01:54:41.241 --> 01:54:44.177
PRIDE, POSSIBILITY AND

01:54:44.244 --> 01:54:45.445
REPRESENTATION AT THE HIGHEST

01:54:45.511 --> 01:54:48.147
LEVEL OF AMERICA'S GAME. WHEN

FERNANDO MANIA SWEPT LOS

01:54:49.949 --> 01:54:51.284
ANGELES IN THE 1980S, IT WASN'T

01:54:51.351 --> 01:54:53.519
JUST ABOUT THE STRIKEOUTS OR

01:54:53.586 --> 01:54:54.454
THE SCREWBALL, THOUGH. HE GAVE

01:54:54.520 --> 01:54:56.189
US PLENTY OF THOSE. IT WAS

01:54:56.256 --> 01:54:58.224
ABOUT THE WAY HE CARRIED AN

01:54:58.291 --> 01:54:59.959
ENTIRE COMMUNITY ON HIS

01:55:00.026 --> 01:55:01.327
SHOULDERS. HE DIDN'T JUST

01:55:01.394 --> 01:55:03.296
BELONG TO LOS ANGELES. HE

01:55:03.363 --> 01:55:06.165
BELONGED TO ALL OF CALIFORNIA,

01:55:06.232 --> 01:55:07.934
FROM THE IMPERIAL VALLEY TO THE

01:55:08.001 --> 01:55:09.269
CENTRAL VALLEY. FAMILIES TUNED

01:55:09.335 --> 01:55:11.938
IN TO SEE HIM PITCH. HE WAS A

01:55:12.005 --> 01:55:14.507
UNIFYING FIGURE IN A STATE AS

01:55:14.574 --> 01:55:16.943
DIVERSE AS OURS. FOR ME AND FOR

SO MANY OTHERS, SEEING SOMEONE

01:55:19.212 --> 01:55:20.246
WHO LOOKED LIKE US ON TV

WEARING THAT FAMOUS DODGER BLUE.

01:55:23.583 --> 01:55:25.418
STANDING TALL ON THE MOUND AND

01:55:25.485 --> 01:55:27.620
LOOKING UP TO THE SKY BEFORE

01:55:27.687 --> 01:55:30.156
EVERY PITCH MEANT EVERYTHING.

01:55:30.223 --> 01:55:33.493
IT TOLD US THAT WE BELONGED.

01:55:33.559 --> 01:55:35.561
THAT OUR HERITAGE, OUR CULTURE,

01:55:35.628 --> 01:55:38.931
OUR DREAMS HAD A PLACE ON THE

01:55:38.998 --> 01:55:41.334
BIGGEST STAGE. MY OWN FAMILY

01:55:41.401 --> 01:55:43.603
ARE LIFELONG DODGER FANS. MY

FERNANDO BROUGHT INTO HOUSEHOLD

01:55:50.343 --> 01:55:54.380
LIKE OURS ALL ACROSS THE STATE.

01:55:54.447 --> 01:55:55.148
FERNANDO GAVE OUR COMMUNITY A

01:55:55.214 --> 01:55:57.550
HERO. HE GAVE FAMILIES A REASON

01:55:57.617 --> 01:55:59.152
TO GATHER AROUND THE RADIO, THE

01:55:59.218 --> 01:56:02.355
TV, OR IN THE CHEAP SEATS AT

01:56:02.422 --> 01:56:03.690
DODGER STADIUM. AND MOST

01:56:03.756 --> 01:56:05.692
IMPORTANTLY, TO BELIEVE. AND

01:56:05.758 --> 01:56:07.493
FOR GENERATIONS OF MEXICAN

AMERICANS, HE OPENED A DOOR

01:56:09.429 --> 01:56:12.165
THAT COULD NEVER BE CLOSED. AS

A LIFELONG DODGER FAN, AS A

01:56:14.534 --> 01:56:16.069

THE FIELD AND IN OUR HEARTS.

01:56:27.547 --> 01:56:29.716
AND WITH THAT, COLLEAGUES, I

01:56:29.782 --> 01:56:31.451

THANK YOU, MADAM SPEAKER. I

01:56:41.394 --> 01:56:42.962
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE EAST SIDE

01:56:43.029 --> 01:56:44.297
OF THE PARKING LOT ENTRANCE,

01:56:44.364 --> 01:56:46.366
SPECIFICALLY, LOT K, FERNANDO

01:56:46.432 --> 01:56:47.900
VALENZUELA, WHOSE STORY IS

01:56:47.967 --> 01:56:50.136
FOREVER WOVEN INTO THE FABRIC

01:56:50.203 --> 01:56:51.504
OF LOS ANGELES. WHEN FERNANDO

01:56:51.571 --> 01:56:54.073
TOOK THE MOUND, HE CARRIED MORE

01:56:54.140 --> 01:56:55.942
THAN A BASEBALL IN HIS HAND. HE

01:56:56.008 --> 01:56:57.176
CARRIED FOLKS THAT LOOKED LIKE

01:56:57.243 --> 01:56:59.212
ME. HE CARRIED THAT COMMUNITY.

01:56:59.278 --> 01:57:01.280
AND, AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID, A

01:57:01.347 --> 01:57:02.115
COMMUNITY ON HIS SHOULDERS. HE

01:57:02.181 --> 01:57:03.750
CARRIED THEIR DREAMS OF

01:57:03.816 --> 01:57:05.485
IMMIGRANTS, THE PRIDE OF

01:57:05.551 --> 01:57:07.019
WORKING FAMILIES, AND THE

01:57:07.086 --> 01:57:10.022
SPIRIT OF A CITY THAT BELIEVES

01:57:10.089 --> 01:57:12.191
IN MIRACLES. FERNANDO MANIA WAS

01:57:12.258 --> 01:57:14.093
NOT JUST ABOUT THOSE SHUTOUTS,

01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:16.662
THOSE STRIKEOUTS. IT WAS ABOUT

WANT TO REMIND EVERYBODY THAT

01:58:32.004 --> 01:58:33.139
FERNANDO VALENZUELA ACTUALLY

01:58:33.206 --> 01:58:35.308
PLAYED FOR THE PADRES. I WAS A

01:58:35.374 --> 01:58:36.175
TEENAGER MYSELF WHEN I SAW HIM

01:58:36.242 --> 01:58:38.277
PLAY FOR THE SAN DIEGO PADRES

01:58:38.344 --> 01:58:42.081
IN THE MID 1990S, AND I ARISE

01:58:42.148 --> 01:58:43.983
BECAUSE HIS STORY IS NOT A

01:58:44.050 --> 01:58:46.118

THE DODGERS. BUT IT'S MORE OF A

01:58:55.094 --> 01:58:57.597
STORY OF OF IMMIGRANTS, REALLY.

01:58:57.663 --> 01:59:00.333
HE CAME FROM MEXICO, AND HE

01:59:00.399 --> 01:59:03.169
CAME HERE WITH A DREAM, AND HE

01:59:03.236 --> 01:59:05.304
SUCCEEDED IN HIS DREAM, AND HE

01:59:05.371 --> 01:59:08.374
GAVE BACK TO THIS COUNTRY. HE

01:59:08.441 --> 01:59:12.111
LOVED THIS COUNTRY. AND AND HE

01:59:12.178 --> 01:59:15.281
LEFT A LOT. AND I THINK OF THAT

01:59:15.348 --> 01:59:16.983
STORY IS REFLECTED IN MANY OF

01:59:17.049 --> 01:59:18.718
US WHOSE PARENTS CAME TO THIS

01:59:18.784 --> 01:59:20.920
COUNTRY AS IMMIGRANTS SEEKING A

DREAM, LOVING THIS NEW COUNTRY

01:59:22.355 --> 01:59:25.725
AND HOPING TO GIVE BACK. AND

01:59:25.791 --> 01:59:27.193
IT'S I'M REMINDED OF THE TIME

THAT FERNANDO VALENZUELA, HE

01:59:28.461 --> 01:59:30.229
MUST HAVE. I NEVER HAD A CHANCE

01:59:30.296 --> 01:59:33.332
TO TO MEET. BUT I CAN ONLY

01:59:33.399 --> 01:59:34.367
IMAGINE. JUST LIKE WHEN MY

PARENTS RETURNED TO MEXICO,

01:59:36.202 --> 01:59:39.005

WAS A GAME OF BASEBALL IN THE

01:59:53.386 --> 01:59:55.021
COUNTRY OF MEXICO, AND I CAN

01:59:55.087 --> 01:59:57.123
ONLY IMAGINE THE PRIDE HE MUST

01:59:57.189 --> 01:59:59.058
HAVE FELT TO RETURN TO HIS

01:59:59.125 --> 02:00:01.060

FOR, AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN SUCH

02:00:11.137 --> 02:00:13.005
A PROUD MOMENT. I'M SURE IT WAS

CHICANA AND CHICANO LEADERS

02:21:40.425 --> 02:21:42.293
THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY, FROM

02:21:58.443 --> 02:21:59.043
LEGISLATURE. THE CHICANO

02:21:59.110 --> 02:22:00.712
MOVEMENT WAS NOT ONLY A

02:22:00.778 --> 02:22:02.413
MOVEMENT OF PROTEST, IT WAS A

02:22:02.480 --> 02:22:03.281
MOVEMENT OF CREATION. IT BUILT

02:22:03.348 --> 02:22:05.450
STRONGER LABOR RIGHTS TO THE

02:22:05.516 --> 02:22:06.117
UNITED FARM WORKERS. IT

02:22:06.184 --> 02:22:08.219
DEMANDED ACCESS TO EDUCATION SO

02:22:08.286 --> 02:22:09.487
THAT FARMWORKERS CHILDREN COULD

02:22:09.554 --> 02:22:11.122
HOLD BOOKS IN THEIR HANDS

02:22:11.189 --> 02:22:12.323
INSTEAD OF BEING TRAPPED BY

02:22:12.390 --> 02:22:15.360
FIELDS. IT GAVE US ART. IT GAVE

02:22:15.426 --> 02:22:17.161
US MUSIC. IT GAVE US POETRY AND

02:22:17.228 --> 02:22:18.696
A LANGUAGE OF RESISTANCE THAT

02:22:18.763 --> 02:22:21.132
STILL EMPOWERS GENERATIONS. I

02:22:21.199 --> 02:22:23.268

02:22:23.334 --> 02:22:24.068

TO STRUGGLE, RESILIENCE AND

02:22:30.441 --> 02:22:33.011
CULTURAL PRIDE FOR GENERATIONS.

02:22:33.077 --> 02:22:34.479
IT WAS IN THESE NEIGHBORHOODS

02:22:34.545 --> 02:22:37.582
THAT MURALS BECAME MANIFESTOS.

02:22:37.649 --> 02:22:39.417
MARCHES BECAME MILESTONES, AND

02:22:39.484 --> 02:22:40.451
VOICES THAT HAD BEEN SILENCED

02:22:40.518 --> 02:22:42.086
BECAME THE SOUNDTRACK OF

02:22:42.153 --> 02:22:44.689
JUSTICE. IT MUST ALSO REMEMBER

02:22:44.756 --> 02:22:46.357

02:22:49.227 --> 02:22:50.528
OUR COMMUNITY, WHOSE LIFE WAS

02:22:50.595 --> 02:22:52.297
TRAGICALLY CUT SHORT DURING THE

02:22:52.363 --> 02:22:54.232
CHICANO MORATORIUM. HIS PEN,

02:22:54.299 --> 02:22:55.633
HIS TRUTH, AND ULTIMATELY HIS

02:22:55.700 --> 02:22:57.302
SACRIFICE REMINDS US OF THE

02:22:57.368 --> 02:22:59.370
COST OF HIS ABILITY AND THE

02:22:59.437 --> 02:23:02.173
POWER OF TELLING OUR OWN STORY.

02:23:02.240 --> 02:23:03.408
MEMBERS. THIS IS NOT JUST

02:23:03.474 --> 02:23:05.243
HISTORY. IT'S MY STORY. IT'S

02:23:05.310 --> 02:23:07.312
OUR STORY. IT'S THE STORY OF

02:23:07.378 --> 02:23:09.347
LOS ANGELES, THE STORY OF

02:23:09.414 --> 02:23:12.283
CALIFORNIA, AND THE STORY OF

02:23:12.350 --> 02:23:13.952
AMERICA. AND YET, EVEN AS WE

02:23:14.018 --> 02:23:15.353
CELEBRATE, WE MUST CONFRONT THE

02:23:15.420 --> 02:23:17.388
PAINFUL TRUTH. TODAY, IN MY

02:23:17.455 --> 02:23:19.123
DISTRICT AND ACROSS THIS NATION,

02:23:19.190 --> 02:23:20.625
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ONCE

02:23:20.692 --> 02:23:22.660
AGAIN TARGETING PEOPLE WHO LOOK

02:23:22.727 --> 02:23:24.529
LIKE ME. FAMILIES ARE BEING

02:23:24.595 --> 02:23:25.330
TORN APART. HARDWORKING MEN AND

02:23:25.396 --> 02:23:27.131
WOMEN WHO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS

02:23:27.198 --> 02:23:29.367
COUNTRY, PAY TAXES AND BELIEVE

02:23:29.434 --> 02:23:31.035
IN THE PROMISE OF THE AMERICAN

02:23:31.102 --> 02:23:33.104

02:23:33.171 --> 02:23:35.673
ABDUCTED AND TREATED AS

02:23:35.740 --> 02:23:36.507
DISPOSABLE. THIS NARRATIVE

02:23:36.574 --> 02:23:38.109
BEING PUSHED BY THIS

02:23:38.176 --> 02:23:39.110
ADMINISTRATION IS NOT JUST

02:23:39.177 --> 02:23:41.612
HARMFUL, IT'S DANGEROUS. IT'S

02:23:41.679 --> 02:23:43.548
MEANT TO ERASE US, TO SILENCE

02:23:43.614 --> 02:23:44.148
US, TO TELL OUR CHILDREN THAT

02:23:44.215 --> 02:23:46.184
THEY DO NOT BELONG IN THE VERY

02:23:46.250 --> 02:23:48.953
COUNTRY THEY HELPED BUILD EVERY

02:23:49.020 --> 02:23:52.156

02:23:57.362 --> 02:23:59.430

02:23:59.497 --> 02:24:00.365
OUR HISTORY, OUR HERITAGE, OUR

02:24:00.431 --> 02:24:02.967
HUMANITY WILL NOT BE DENIED.

02:24:03.034 --> 02:24:05.603
CHICANO HERITAGE MONTH IS NOT

02:24:05.670 --> 02:24:06.971
JUST ABOUT THE PAST, IT IS

02:24:07.038 --> 02:24:08.506
ABOUT THE PRESENT AND THE

02:24:08.573 --> 02:24:10.174

02:24:16.247 --> 02:24:18.149
TALL IN THE FACE OF HATE. AND

02:24:18.216 --> 02:24:19.517
WE REMIND FUTURE GENERATIONS

02:24:19.584 --> 02:24:20.985

THE LARGEST COLLECTION OF

02:24:51.516 --> 02:24:54.218
OUTDOOR MURALS ANYWHERE, A

02:24:54.285 --> 02:24:56.254

THE CHICANO MOVEMENT, NOT JUST

IN SAN DIEGO BUT IN THE

02:25:01.059 --> 02:25:02.627
SOUTHWESTERN UNITED STATES. IN

02:25:02.693 --> 02:25:04.362

CELEBRATED CHICANO PARK AND THE

02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:10.334
ESTABLISHMENT OF THAT PARK. AND

02:25:10.401 --> 02:25:12.070
THAT PARK WAS ESTABLISHED

02:25:12.136 --> 02:25:14.272
BECAUSE OF A FIGHT FROM THE

02:25:14.338 --> 02:25:17.175
COMMUNITY WHO FOUGHT AGAINST

02:25:17.241 --> 02:25:20.044
TRUE OPPRESSION BACK IN THE DAY,

02:25:20.111 --> 02:25:22.246
TAKING OVER LAND TO CREATE A

02:25:22.313 --> 02:25:24.315

02:25:27.485 --> 02:25:29.187
THE WORLD, WHERE THE LOWRIDER

02:25:29.253 --> 02:25:31.489
COMMUNITY FINDS ITS PLACE,

02:25:31.556 --> 02:25:33.891
WHERE MANY OF US STILL FIND SO

02:25:33.958 --> 02:25:37.462
MUCH ABILITY TO TO BE INSPIRED,

02:25:37.528 --> 02:25:38.229
TO DO GOOD WORK FOR OUR

02:25:38.296 --> 02:25:40.164
COMMUNITY. THE CHICANO MOVEMENT

02:25:40.231 --> 02:25:41.899
HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT UPLIFTING

02:25:41.966 --> 02:25:45.670
PEOPLE, ABOUT WORKING HARD,

02:25:45.736 --> 02:25:47.238
DEDICATING YOURSELF. SO WHETHER

02:25:47.305 --> 02:25:49.307
IT WAS A CHICANO STUDIES COURSE

02:25:49.373 --> 02:25:52.643
IN COLLEGE TO HELP MANY OF US

02:25:52.710 --> 02:25:54.245
PERHAPS BETTER FIND OUR

02:25:58.449 --> 02:26:00.184
OUR CULTURE IS OFTEN CLASH,

02:26:00.251 --> 02:26:02.320

02:26:02.386 --> 02:26:05.356
AS WE CAN BE, BUT ALSO WANT TO

02:26:05.423 --> 02:26:07.325
RECOGNIZE OUR OUR ROOTS AND

02:26:07.391 --> 02:26:09.227
WHERE WE COME FROM. CHICANISMO

02:26:09.293 --> 02:26:11.662
IS ABOUT THAT, AND I THINK IT'S

02:26:11.729 --> 02:26:12.230
IMPORTANT THAT WE RECOGNIZE

02:26:12.296 --> 02:26:14.465

02:44:39.069 --> 02:44:41.137
THESE JOBS ARE SO IMPORTANT,

02:44:41.204 --> 02:44:42.806
AND THEY PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE

02:44:42.872 --> 02:44:44.374
IN OUR NATIONAL ECONOMY,

02:44:44.441 --> 02:44:47.344
INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY. IT IS NO

02:44:47.410 --> 02:44:50.480
ONE'S BUSINESS IN THIS CHAMBER.

02:44:50.547 --> 02:44:52.983
WHAT THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION

02:44:53.049 --> 02:44:55.085
DOES AS IT RELATES TO TARIFFS,

02:44:55.151 --> 02:44:57.287
IN NEGOTIATING FAIR TRADE DEALS.

02:44:57.354 --> 02:45:00.156
AS MUCH AS I WORRY ABOUT OUR

02:45:00.223 --> 02:45:02.425
PORT JOBS, I MUST ALSO WORRY

02:45:02.492 --> 02:45:03.159
ABOUT THE MANUFACTURING JOBS

02:45:03.226 --> 02:45:05.996
THAT OUR COUNTRY HAS LOST YEAR

02:45:06.062 --> 02:45:09.599
AFTER YEAR. BLUE COLLAR JOBS,

02:45:09.666 --> 02:45:13.236
MIDDLE CLASS JOBS. WE'VE LOST

02:45:13.303 --> 02:45:14.437
THESE JOBS BECAUSE OF UNFAIR

02:45:14.504 --> 02:45:17.173
TRADE POLICIES. AND WE NOW HAVE

02:45:17.240 --> 02:45:19.309
A PRESIDENT WHO HAS SAID, NO

02:45:19.376 --> 02:45:22.279
MORE WALL STREET ENRICHMENT, NO

02:45:22.345 --> 02:45:24.314
MORE FOREIGN GOVERNMENT

02:45:24.381 --> 02:45:26.016
ENRICHMENT. WE NEED OUR JOB

02:45:26.082 --> 02:45:28.385
BASE BACK. AND ALL WE'RE ASKING

02:45:28.451 --> 02:45:30.220
FOR ARE FAIR TRADE DEALS. IF WE

02:45:30.287 --> 02:45:32.289
HAVE FAIR TRADE DEALS, I

02:45:32.355 --> 02:45:34.057
BELIEVE THE AMERICAN WORKER CAN

02:45:34.124 --> 02:45:36.293
COMPETE AND WIN. BUT WHEN WE

02:45:36.359 --> 02:45:39.462
HAVE UNFAIR TRADE DEALS, IT'S

02:45:39.529 --> 02:45:40.363
PREDATORY. THE BILLIONAIRES AT

02:45:40.430 --> 02:45:43.033
THE VERY TOP OF THE SCHEME, THE

02:45:43.099 --> 02:45:44.301
OUTSOURCERS, THEY'RE THE ONES

02:45:44.367 --> 02:45:47.170
PROFITING. WE'VE MADE A LOT OF

02:45:47.237 --> 02:45:49.539
MISTAKES ON TRADE POLICY OVER

02:45:49.606 --> 02:45:51.541
THE YEARS. I THINK PRESIDENT

02:45:51.608 --> 02:45:53.076
CLINTON'S DECISION TO DOUBLE

02:45:53.143 --> 02:45:55.645
AND TRIPLE DOWN ON UNFAIR DEALS

02:45:55.712 --> 02:45:59.582
REALLY HURT THESE BLUE COLLAR

02:45:59.649 --> 02:46:00.383
WORKERS AND UNDERMINED OUR

02:46:00.450 --> 02:46:02.285
ABILITY TO PROVIDE FOR MIDDLE

02:46:02.352 --> 02:46:05.055
CLASS PROSPERITY. SO I URGE

02:46:05.121 --> 02:46:08.258
THIS CHAMBER, DON'T STICK YOUR

02:46:08.325 --> 02:46:10.060
NOSE INTO AN ISSUE THAT IT

02:46:10.126 --> 02:46:11.394
DOESN'T BELONG IN. LET'S ALLOW

02:46:11.461 --> 02:46:12.996
OUR PRESIDENT TO NEGOTIATE

02:46:13.063 --> 02:46:15.732
BETTER TRADE DEALS. LET'S GIVE

02:46:15.799 --> 02:46:17.300
THAT RENEGOTIATION PROCESS TIME.

02:46:17.367 --> 02:46:19.102
WE'RE ALREADY SEEING SOME VERY

02:46:19.169 --> 02:46:22.272
GOOD TRADE DEALS GET ANNOUNCED,

02:46:22.339 --> 02:46:25.175
AND IT'S NOT THE TIME TO, FOR

02:46:25.241 --> 02:46:26.943
POLITICS, TRY TO UNDERCUT HIS

02:46:27.010 --> 02:46:29.079
NEGOTIATING POSITION. I URGE

02:46:29.145 --> 02:46:33.116
THAT WE NOT PROCEED FORWARD ON

02:46:33.183 --> 02:46:37.153
H.R. 14 TODAY. AS I REMEMBER,

02:46:37.220 --> 02:46:39.189
RANSOM, YOU'RE RECOGNIZED.

02:46:39.255 --> 02:46:40.957
THANK YOU, MADAM SPEAKER.

02:46:41.024 --> 02:46:43.193
COLLEAGUES, I RISE TODAY IN

02:46:43.259 --> 02:46:46.029
STRONG SUPPORT OF AG 14. I WANT

02:46:46.096 --> 02:46:47.364
TO THANK THE MEMBER FROM CARSON

02:46:47.430 --> 02:46:48.198
FOR AUTHORING THIS IMPORTANT

02:46:48.264 --> 02:46:50.033
RESOLUTION THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE

02:46:50.100 --> 02:46:52.469
VALUES OF OUR PORTS, WHILE ALSO

02:46:52.535 --> 02:46:53.103
RAISING THE CURRENT CHALLENGES

02:46:53.169 --> 02:46:55.372
THAT THE PORTS ARE FACING DUE

02:46:55.438 --> 02:46:57.574
TO UNCERTAINTY CREATED BY

02:46:57.640 --> 02:46:59.175
FEDERAL TARIFFS. THIS IS NOT

02:46:59.242 --> 02:47:01.077
THE FIRST TIME OUR PORTS HAVE

02:47:01.144 --> 02:47:03.680
FACED UNCERTAINTY. OUR PORTS

02:47:03.747 --> 02:47:05.215
ARE JUST NOW RECOVERING FROM

02:47:05.281 --> 02:47:06.416
SOMETHING THAT WE COULD NOT

02:47:06.483 --> 02:47:09.119
PREVENT, WHICH IS THE COVID

02:47:09.185 --> 02:47:10.220
DISASTER WHICH IMPACTED OUR

02:47:10.286 --> 02:47:13.056
COURTS, OUR PORTS. BUT THIS

02:47:13.123 --> 02:47:16.059
TIME WE HAVE A MANUFACTURED

02:47:16.126 --> 02:47:18.128
ISSUE THAT IS HAPPENING ACROSS

02:47:18.194 --> 02:47:19.929
OUR PORTS. OUR PORTS ARE VITAL

02:47:19.996 --> 02:47:21.164
TO OUR STATE, NATIONAL AND

02:47:21.231 --> 02:47:23.166
LOCAL ECONOMIES. IT IS

02:47:23.233 --> 02:47:25.502
ABSOLUTELY OUR JOB TO INTERJECT

02:47:25.568 --> 02:47:28.238
AND TO INTERCEDE FOR OUR

02:47:28.304 --> 02:47:30.039
COMMUNITIES AND THE PORTS. WHEN

02:47:30.106 --> 02:47:32.609
WE ARE CONCERNED WITH HOW THE

02:47:32.675 --> 02:47:34.377
FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION IS

02:47:34.444 --> 02:47:36.112
IMPACTING OUR LOCAL PORTS, IT

02:47:36.179 --> 02:47:37.914
DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE CANNOT

02:47:37.981 --> 02:47:40.016
WORK TO MAKE OUR TRADE DEALS

02:47:40.083 --> 02:47:42.619
BETTER. WE CAN DO MORE THAN ONE

02:47:42.685 --> 02:47:44.354
THING AT A TIME WITHOUT HURTING

02:47:44.421 --> 02:47:46.289
THIS COUNTRY'S PORTS. I PROUDLY

02:47:46.356 --> 02:47:48.024
REPRESENT THE PORT OF STOCKTON,

02:47:48.091 --> 02:47:50.126
CALIFORNIA'S FIRST INLAND PORT.

02:47:50.193 --> 02:47:51.428
IT'S ALSO THE LARGEST INLAND

02:47:51.494 --> 02:47:53.196
PORT, WHICH CREATES A CRUCIAL

02:47:53.263 --> 02:47:55.832
LINK FOR THE MOVEMENT OF

02:47:55.899 --> 02:47:57.000
AGRICULTURAL MANUFACTURED GOODS

02:47:57.066 --> 02:47:58.301
THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND WHILE

02:47:58.368 --> 02:48:00.270
WE SUPPORT BRINGING

02:48:00.336 --> 02:48:02.439
MANUFACTURING BACK TO THE US,

02:48:02.505 --> 02:48:04.107
AND WE SUPPORT STRENGTHENING

02:48:04.174 --> 02:48:05.074
MANUFACTURING JOBS HERE IN THE

02:48:05.141 --> 02:48:07.210
US, WE CANNOT IGNORE THE JOBS

02:48:07.277 --> 02:48:10.213
THAT WE HAVE AT OUR PORTS, AND

02:48:10.280 --> 02:48:12.282
WE CANNOT IGNORE THAT OUR PORTS

02:48:12.348 --> 02:48:14.250
ARE VITAL TO OUR ECONOMIC

02:48:14.317 --> 02:48:15.218
SUSTAINABILITY. IN MY COMMUNITY,

02:48:15.285 --> 02:48:17.220
THE PORT OF STOCKTON CONNECTS

02:48:17.287 --> 02:48:18.521
THE SAN JOAQUIN AND SACRAMENTO

02:48:18.588 --> 02:48:20.156
RIVERS WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO

02:48:20.223 --> 02:48:22.258
BAY, ENSURING THAT WE ARE A

02:48:22.325 --> 02:48:25.161
VITAL HUB FOR TRADE. WE MUST

02:48:25.228 --> 02:48:27.330
PROTECT THESE TRADE ECOSYSTEMS

02:48:27.397 --> 02:48:29.065
BECAUSE WHEN PORTS STRUGGLE, IT

02:48:29.132 --> 02:48:31.301
PUTS OUR ECONOMY AT RISK AND

02:48:31.367 --> 02:48:32.902
THE REAL JOBS AND FAMILIES AND

02:48:32.969 --> 02:48:35.104
COMMUNITIES THAT RELY ON THEM.

02:48:35.171 --> 02:48:37.974
I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN. MR.

02:48:38.041 --> 02:48:39.676
THE MEMBER FROM CARSON, I WANT

02:48:39.742 --> 02:48:41.311

MIGHTY REDWOOD CITY PORT, I

02:49:33.329 --> 02:49:35.398
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA,

02:49:35.465 --> 02:49:37.300
WHEN WE HAVE THESE TERRORISTS

02:49:37.367 --> 02:49:39.536

THESE PORTS IN THEIR HIGH

02:50:01.524 --> 02:50:02.825

UNDERSTAND FIRSTHAND THE

COUNTRY'S IMMIGRATION LAWS HAVE

02:53:08.277 --> 02:53:10.780
NOT BEEN UPDATED IN NEARLY 40

02:53:10.847 --> 02:53:13.182
YEARS, BEYOND THE LIFETIME OF

02:53:13.249 --> 02:53:14.884
MANY NEW LEGISLATORS HERE TODAY

02:53:14.951 --> 02:53:17.086
ON THE FLOOR DURING THAT TIME,

02:53:17.153 --> 02:53:19.288
CALIFORNIA HAS BECOME HOME TO

02:53:19.355 --> 02:53:21.023
OVER 10 MILLION IMMIGRANTS WHO

02:53:21.090 --> 02:53:22.158
HAVE BUILT THEIR LIVES HERE,

02:53:22.225 --> 02:53:25.094
RAISED THEIR CHILDREN, AND

02:53:25.161 --> 02:53:27.130
CONTRIBUTED TO OUR COMMUNITIES.

02:53:27.196 --> 02:53:29.365
1 IN 10 WORKERS IN OUR STATE IS

02:53:29.432 --> 02:53:30.066
UNDOCUMENTED, AND THEY

02:53:30.133 --> 02:53:32.902
CONTRIBUTE MORE THAN 8.5

02:53:32.969 --> 02:53:33.836
BILLION ANNUALLY IN

02:53:33.903 --> 02:53:35.671
CALIFORNIA'S STATE AND LOCAL

02:53:35.738 --> 02:53:38.074
TAXES, ACCORDING TO A RECENT

02:53:38.141 --> 02:53:40.376
POLL. NEARLY 75% OF CALIFORNIA

02:53:40.443 --> 02:53:42.945
VOTERS, INCLUDING 50% OF

02:53:43.012 --> 02:53:44.680
REPUBLICANS, BELIEVE THAT

02:53:44.747 --> 02:53:45.348
ELIMINATING UNDOCUMENTED

02:53:45.414 --> 02:53:46.983
IMMIGRANTS FROM THE WORKFORCE

02:53:47.049 --> 02:53:48.217
WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE

02:53:48.284 --> 02:53:50.286
STATE'S ECONOMY. NO MATTER

02:53:50.353 --> 02:53:52.221
WHICH SIDE OF THE AISLE YOU SIT

02:53:52.288 --> 02:53:54.257
ON, THERE IS A RECOGNITION THAT

02:53:54.323 --> 02:53:55.424
SOMETHING IS BROKEN AND NEEDS

02:53:55.491 --> 02:53:58.094
TO BE FIXED BEYOND BEING

02:53:58.161 --> 02:53:59.295
ESSENTIAL TO OUR STATE. THESE

02:53:59.362 --> 02:54:01.097
PEOPLE ARE OUR NEIGHBORS,

02:54:01.164 --> 02:54:03.099
COWORKERS, AND FRIENDS. FOR

02:54:03.166 --> 02:54:06.102
MANY OF US, THEY ARE OUR FAMILY.

02:54:06.169 --> 02:54:08.371
AG URGES THE ASSEMBLY AND THE

02:54:08.437 --> 02:54:10.173
SENATE TO SUPPORT LEGISLATION

02:54:10.239 --> 02:54:12.108
THAT WOULD UPDATE THE CURRENT

02:54:12.175 --> 02:54:13.276
REGISTRY STATUTE, SO THAT

02:54:13.342 --> 02:54:14.143
IMMIGRANTS MAY QUALIFY FOR

02:54:14.210 --> 02:54:16.045
LAWFUL, PERMANENT STATUS IF

02:54:16.112 --> 02:54:17.313
THEY HAVE CONTINUOUSLY LIVED IN

02:54:17.380 --> 02:54:21.050
THE US FOR AT LEAST SEVEN YEARS.

02:54:21.117 --> 02:54:22.418
FOR MANY, THIS WOULD MEAN

02:54:22.485 --> 02:54:24.887
FINALLY LIVING WITHOUT THE FEAR

02:54:24.954 --> 02:54:25.388
OF DEPORTATION, FAMILY

02:54:25.454 --> 02:54:26.255
SEPARATION, OR LOSING

02:54:26.322 --> 02:54:28.224
EVERYTHING THEY'VE WORKED FOR.

02:54:28.291 --> 02:54:31.527
THIS FEAR IS MORE REAL NOW THAN

02:54:31.594 --> 02:54:32.995
EVER. WHAT WE ARE WITNESSING

02:54:33.062 --> 02:54:35.198
ACROSS OUR COUNTRY IS A DRASTIC

02:54:35.264 --> 02:54:37.500
INCREASE IN MASS DEPORTATIONS,

02:54:37.567 --> 02:54:38.501
FAMILY SEPARATIONS, AND AN

02:54:38.568 --> 02:54:41.337
EXPANSION OF INHUMANE DETENTION

02:54:41.404 --> 02:54:43.039
CENTERS. THE MAJORITY OF THOSE

02:54:43.105 --> 02:54:44.440
CAUGHT UP IN ENFORCEMENT SWEEPS

02:54:44.507 --> 02:54:46.976
ARE LAW ABIDING IMMIGRANTS AND

02:54:47.043 --> 02:54:50.179
EVEN U.S. CITIZENS. FAMILIES

02:54:50.246 --> 02:54:51.948
ARE BEING BROKEN APART NOT

02:54:52.014 --> 02:54:54.250
BECAUSE THEY BROKE THE LAW, BUT

02:54:54.317 --> 02:54:55.284
BECAUSE OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM

02:54:55.351 --> 02:54:58.087
IS BROKEN. IT IS CRITICAL WE

02:54:58.154 --> 02:55:01.057
ALL SPEAK UP. JUST RECENTLY,

02:55:01.123 --> 02:55:02.191
HUNDREDS OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS

02:55:02.258 --> 02:55:04.293
WHO ARE LIVING THROUGH THE FEAR

02:55:04.360 --> 02:55:05.561
AND PAIN OF THE ATTACKS ON

02:55:05.628 --> 02:55:06.429
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES WALKED

02:55:06.495 --> 02:55:08.631
FROM VACAVILLE TO SACRAMENTO TO

02:55:08.698 --> 02:55:10.166
SUPPORT THIS EFFORT TO UPDATE

02:55:10.233 --> 02:55:13.636
THE REGISTRY BILLS, AGR 17

02:55:13.703 --> 02:55:15.404
HONORS THEIR EFFORTS, THEIR

02:55:15.471 --> 02:55:17.940
COURAGE. IT ALSO HONORS JAIME

02:55:18.007 --> 02:55:21.410
GARCIA, ROBERTO CARLOS MONTOYA.

02:55:21.477 --> 02:55:23.079
THEIR FAMILIES, AND ALL THOSE

02:55:23.145 --> 02:55:25.281
WHO HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES

02:55:25.348 --> 02:55:26.482
BECAUSE OF THE IMMIGRATION

02:55:26.549 --> 02:55:29.151
RAIDS TAKING PLACE. THIS IS NOT

02:55:29.218 --> 02:55:31.053
JUST A POLICY ISSUE, IT'S ABOUT

02:55:31.120 --> 02:55:33.256
JUSTICE AND DIGNITY. IT'S ABOUT

02:55:33.322 --> 02:55:35.224
ALLOWING PEOPLE LIKE MY OWN

02:55:35.291 --> 02:55:36.192
FAMILY MEMBERS, LIKE COUNTLESS

02:55:36.259 --> 02:55:38.294
IN EACH AND EVERY ONE OF OUR

02:55:38.361 --> 02:55:40.897
DISTRICTS, TO BE SEEN AND

02:55:40.963 --> 02:55:41.530
TREATED AS FULL PARTICIPANTS IN

02:55:41.597 --> 02:55:44.200
THE COUNTRY THAT THEY CALL HOME.

02:55:44.267 --> 02:55:46.002
THIS RESOLUTION REFLECTS THE

02:55:46.068 --> 02:55:47.770

02:55:53.342 --> 02:55:54.977
COMMITMENT TO A HUMANE,

02:55:55.044 --> 02:55:57.213
WORKABLE, AND JUST IMMIGRATION

02:55:57.280 --> 02:55:59.482

PASSAGE OF SB 2606 AND H.R.

02:56:24.140 --> 02:56:25.975
1511. IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES ARE

02:56:26.042 --> 02:56:28.511
THE BACKBONE OF OUR STATE, AND

02:56:28.577 --> 02:56:29.211
THEY DESERVE DIGNITY,

02:56:29.278 --> 02:56:30.947

02:56:36.085 --> 02:56:38.187
OUR CHILDREN, HARVEST OUR FOOD,

02:56:38.254 --> 02:56:39.121
AND LEAD OUR UNIONS. THEY ARE

02:56:39.188 --> 02:56:41.023
DOCTORS. THEY ARE NURSES. THEY

02:56:41.090 --> 02:56:42.091
ARE TEACHERS. THEY ARE THE

02:56:42.158 --> 02:56:43.726
FABRIC AND THE FOUNDATION OF

02:56:43.793 --> 02:56:45.394

STATUS FOR UNDOCUMENTED

02:56:58.574 --> 02:57:00.176
COMMUNITY. WITHOUT THIS, OUR

02:57:00.242 --> 02:57:02.244
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM WILL REMAIN

02:57:02.311 --> 02:57:04.380
BROKEN AND OUR UNDOCUMENTED

02:57:04.447 --> 02:57:05.114
COMMUNITY WILL BE SUBJECT TO

02:57:05.181 --> 02:57:06.983

RESOLUTION 17, WHICH URGES

02:57:33.409 --> 02:57:34.477
CONGRESS TO PASS THE RENEWING

02:57:34.543 --> 02:57:36.779
IMMIGRATION PROVISIONS OF THE

02:57:36.846 --> 02:57:38.948
IMMIGRATION ACT OF 1929, A

02:57:39.015 --> 02:57:40.216
CRITICAL AND LONG OVERDUE

02:57:40.282 --> 02:57:41.317
UPDATE TO OUR NATION'S

02:57:41.384 --> 02:57:43.119
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. FOR NEARLY

02:57:43.185 --> 02:57:45.187
FOUR DECADES, THE FEDERAL

02:57:45.254 --> 02:57:46.622
GOVERNMENT HAS FAILED TO

02:57:46.689 --> 02:57:48.624
ADVANCE MEANINGFUL IMMIGRATION

02:57:48.691 --> 02:57:50.326
REFORM. IN THAT TIME, MILLIONS

02:57:50.393 --> 02:57:53.095
OF INDIVIDUALS, MANY OF THEM IN

02:57:53.162 --> 02:57:54.530
CALIFORNIA, HAVE BUILT LIVES,

02:57:54.597 --> 02:57:56.032
FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES UNDER

02:57:56.098 --> 02:57:57.600
A SYSTEM THAT REMAINS

02:57:57.666 --> 02:57:59.201
FUNDAMENTALLY BROKEN AND

02:57:59.268 --> 02:58:02.304
OUTDATED. CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO

02:58:02.371 --> 02:58:02.805
THE LARGEST IMMIGRATION

02:58:02.872 --> 02:58:04.573
POPULATION IN THE COUNTRY,

02:58:04.640 --> 02:58:05.975
NEARLY 10 MILLION INDIVIDUALS.

02:58:06.042 --> 02:58:08.611
THEY ARE OUR NEIGHBORS, OUR

02:58:08.677 --> 02:58:11.013
COLLEAGUES, OUR CAREGIVERS, AND

02:58:11.080 --> 02:58:12.081
ESSENTIAL MEMBERS OF OUR

02:58:12.148 --> 02:58:14.483
WORKFORCE. THEY ARE

02:58:14.550 --> 02:58:17.286
CALIFORNIANS. ONE IN EVERY TEN

02:58:17.353 --> 02:58:19.388
WORKERS IN THIS STATE IS AN

02:58:19.455 --> 02:58:20.356
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT.

02:58:20.423 --> 02:58:21.357
COLLECTIVELY, UNDOCUMENTED

02:58:21.424 --> 02:58:23.592
IMMIGRANTS CONTRIBUTE MORE THAN

02:58:23.659 --> 02:58:26.562
51 BILLION ANNUALLY IN STATE

02:58:26.629 --> 02:58:27.963
AND LOCAL TAXES. THE

02:58:28.030 --> 02:58:30.132
CONTRIBUTIONS OF IMMIGRANTS IS

02:58:30.199 --> 02:58:32.535
NOT INSIGNIFICANT, AND IT IS

02:58:32.601 --> 02:58:32.935
TIME THIS FEDERAL

02:58:33.002 --> 02:58:34.403
ADMINISTRATION CREATED A

02:58:34.470 --> 02:58:35.371
PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP FOR

02:58:35.438 --> 02:58:38.074
THESE HARD WORKING INDIVIDUALS.

02:58:38.140 --> 02:58:40.176
MEMBERS, I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR

02:58:40.242 --> 02:58:43.045

THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

02:58:44.480 --> 02:58:46.515

02:58:46.582 --> 02:58:50.586
ORTEGA, YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

02:58:50.653 --> 02:58:54.056
THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. AS VICE

02:58:54.123 --> 02:58:56.058
CHAIR OF THE LATINO CAUCUS, I

02:58:56.125 --> 02:58:58.494
AM PROUD TO RISE IN STRONG

02:58:58.561 --> 02:59:00.763
SUPPORT OF THE AGR 17. LIKE

02:59:00.830 --> 02:59:03.432
MANY IMMIGRANTS, MY FAMILY CAME

02:59:03.499 --> 02:59:06.068
TO THE UNITED STATES WHEN I WAS

02:59:06.135 --> 02:59:07.937
JUST THREE YEARS OLD, NOT JUST

02:59:08.003 --> 02:59:10.406
IN SEARCH OF THE AMERICAN DREAM,

02:59:10.473 --> 02:59:12.274
BUT TO CONTRIBUTE TO IT. AND I

02:59:12.341 --> 02:59:14.510
WATCHED MY PARENTS WORK VERY

02:59:14.577 --> 02:59:18.414
HARD DAY IN AND DAY OUT. AS I

02:59:18.481 --> 02:59:20.182
DROVE HERE TODAY TO OUR

02:59:20.249 --> 02:59:23.085
BEAUTIFUL STATE CAPITOL, I

02:59:23.152 --> 02:59:24.286
REMEMBERED THE FEDERAL BUILDING

02:59:24.353 --> 02:59:26.322
IN SAN FRANCISCO, IN WHICH I

02:59:26.388 --> 02:59:29.225
STOOD IN LINE WITH MY PARENTS

02:59:29.291 --> 02:59:31.160
TO GET OUR AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP,

02:59:31.227 --> 02:59:34.196
A PATH THAT WAS GIVEN TO US BY

02:59:34.263 --> 02:59:37.666
PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN, A

02:59:37.733 --> 02:59:38.968
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT WHO DID

02:59:39.034 --> 02:59:42.271
NOT DECIDE TO PUT ME IN A CAGE

02:59:42.338 --> 02:59:45.307
AT THREE YEARS OLD, OR RIP ME

02:59:45.374 --> 02:59:48.878
FROM MY MOTHER'S ARMS. A

02:59:48.944 --> 02:59:51.180
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT WHO DIDN'T

02:59:51.247 --> 02:59:53.382
DEPLOY MASKED MEN TO SNATCH MY

02:59:53.449 --> 02:59:58.654
DAD, MY BROTHERS, OR MY UNCLES.

02:59:58.721 --> 03:00:01.157
AG 17 IS NOT JUST AN

03:00:01.223 --> 03:00:02.424
AFFIRMATION OF OUR SUPPORT FOR

03:00:02.491 --> 03:00:04.493
IMMIGRATION REFORM. IT IS

03:00:04.560 --> 03:00:08.097
PERSONAL FOR MANY OF US. AGAR

03:00:08.164 --> 03:00:13.402
17, IS A PRIORITIZATION TO

03:00:13.469 --> 03:00:15.337
REALIZE THAT WE ALL DESERVE

03:00:15.404 --> 03:00:19.441
THAT AMERICAN DREAM. PRIOR TO

03:00:19.508 --> 03:00:22.611
REALIZING OUR U.S. CITIZENSHIP

03:00:22.678 --> 03:00:27.116
STATUS, I ALSO GREW UP FEARING

03:00:27.183 --> 03:00:29.718
THAT EVERY DOOR KNOCK WAS GOING

03:00:29.785 --> 03:00:31.187
TO BE ICE AND THAT THEY WERE

03:00:31.253 --> 03:00:34.557
GOING TO TAKE ME AND MY FAMILY

03:00:34.623 --> 03:00:37.126
AWAY, THAT MY DAD WOULD GO TO

03:00:37.193 --> 03:00:40.462
WORK AND NEVER COME HOME.

03:00:40.529 --> 03:00:43.933
UNFORTUNATELY, MEMBERS, THIS IS

03:00:43.999 --> 03:00:46.235
THE SAME FEAR THAT SO MANY

03:00:46.302 --> 03:00:47.970
FAMILIES ARE LIVING WITH TODAY

03:00:48.037 --> 03:00:53.008
UNDER THE UNJUST, UNJUST TERROR

03:00:53.075 --> 03:00:56.979
THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS

03:00:57.046 --> 03:00:59.815
BROUGHT ON OUR COUNTRY. THIS

03:00:59.882 --> 03:01:01.283
ADMINISTRATION IS NOT TARGETING

03:01:01.350 --> 03:01:04.119
CRIMINALS. THEY ARE TARGETING

03:01:04.186 --> 03:01:06.055
PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE ME, WHO

03:01:06.121 --> 03:01:08.290
LOOK LIKE OUR FAMILIES, WHO

03:01:08.357 --> 03:01:10.759
LOOK LIKE OUR UNITED STATES

03:01:10.826 --> 03:01:14.597
SENATOR ALEX PADILLA. THEY ARE

03:01:14.663 --> 03:01:16.699
TARGETING HARDWORKING,

03:01:16.765 --> 03:01:19.668
TAXPAYING INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE

03:01:19.735 --> 03:01:21.036
BEEN CONTRIBUTING TO THE

03:01:21.103 --> 03:01:23.839
AMERICAN DREAM AND WHO DESERVE

03:01:23.906 --> 03:01:25.107
A CHANCE, JUST LIKE MY FAMILY

03:01:25.174 --> 03:01:28.944
AND I HAD. WE ARE NOT ALONE IN

03:01:29.011 --> 03:01:32.381
THIS. THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS

03:01:32.448 --> 03:01:35.417
AND CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT

03:01:35.484 --> 03:01:38.354
IMMIGRATION AND A PATH TO

03:01:38.420 --> 03:01:39.521
CITIZENSHIP. FOR THESE REASONS,

03:01:39.588 --> 03:01:43.225
I AM PROUD TO SUPPORT RJR 17

03:01:43.292 --> 03:01:45.494

03:02:02.344 --> 03:02:04.980
SUPPORT OF RJR 17, A RESOLUTION

03:02:05.047 --> 03:02:06.482
URGING CONGRESS TO CREATE A

03:02:06.548 --> 03:02:08.317
PATHWAY TO PERMANENT RESIDENCY

03:02:08.384 --> 03:02:10.452
FOR MILLIONS OF UNDOCUMENTED

03:02:10.519 --> 03:02:11.220
IMMIGRANTS WHO HAVE MADE

03:02:11.287 --> 03:02:12.688
CALIFORNIA THEIR HOME. THIS

03:02:12.755 --> 03:02:14.056
RESOLUTION RECOGNIZES THE

03:02:14.123 --> 03:02:15.257
REALITY FACED BY MILLIONS OF

03:02:15.324 --> 03:02:17.326
HARDWORKING IMMIGRANTS WHO LIVE,

03:02:17.393 --> 03:02:18.594
WORK AND RAISE THEIR FAMILIES

03:02:18.661 --> 03:02:20.195
HERE, YET STILL LACK THE

03:02:20.262 --> 03:02:22.131
SECURITY OF LEGAL STATUS. MANY

03:02:22.197 --> 03:02:24.133
OF THESE FAMILIES HAVE BEEN

03:02:24.199 --> 03:02:25.334
HERE FOR DECADES. THEY PAY

03:02:25.401 --> 03:02:26.702
TAXES, CONTRIBUTE TO OUR

03:02:26.769 --> 03:02:27.536
ECONOMY, AND STRENGTHEN THE

03:02:27.603 --> 03:02:29.805
CULTURAL, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL

03:02:29.872 --> 03:02:30.839
FABRIC OF OUR COMMUNITIES. AND

03:02:30.906 --> 03:02:32.174
BECAUSE OF A SYSTEM THAT HAS

03:02:32.241 --> 03:02:34.176
REMAINED FROZEN FOR NEARLY 40

03:02:34.243 --> 03:02:36.312
YEARS, THEY'RE STILL LEFT IN

03:02:36.378 --> 03:02:38.113
LIMBO. UPDATING OUR BROKEN

03:02:38.180 --> 03:02:39.214
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IS NOT

03:02:39.281 --> 03:02:41.083
RADICAL. IT'S RATIONAL, AND

03:02:41.150 --> 03:02:43.252
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AS

03:02:43.319 --> 03:02:44.920
CO-CHAIR OF THE CAUCUS, I AM

03:02:44.987 --> 03:02:46.121
PROUD TO STAND WITH OUR

03:02:46.188 --> 03:02:47.156
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES WHOSE

03:02:47.222 --> 03:02:48.891
STORIES ECHO OUR OWN. TOGETHER,

03:02:48.957 --> 03:02:51.293
WE ARE GUIDED BY A COMMITMENT

03:02:51.360 --> 03:02:53.262
TO DIGNITY, COMPASSION, AND A

03:02:53.329 --> 03:02:54.463
CLEAR EYED UNDERSTANDING THAT

03:02:54.530 --> 03:02:56.165
CALIFORNIA'S STRENGTH LIES IN

03:02:56.231 --> 03:02:58.400
ITS DIVERSITY. AS A STATE BUILT

03:02:58.467 --> 03:03:00.235
BY IMMIGRANTS. AND LET ME SAY,

03:03:00.302 --> 03:03:01.370
MR. CHAIR, THIS IS VERY

03:03:01.437 --> 03:03:03.038
PERSONAL FOR MEMBERS OF OUR

03:03:03.105 --> 03:03:04.573
JEWISH CAUCUS. WE ARE A

03:03:04.640 --> 03:03:06.709
COMMUNITY OF IMMIGRANTS. WE ALL

03:03:06.775 --> 03:03:08.010
REMEMBER THE STORIES OF OUR

03:03:08.077 --> 03:03:09.311
FRIENDS AND FAMILY THAT CAME TO

03:03:09.378 --> 03:03:11.347
THESE SHORES, OFTEN TO ESCAPE

03:03:11.413 --> 03:03:12.348
PERSECUTION OR LOOKING FOR

03:03:12.414 --> 03:03:13.415
BETTER OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR

03:03:13.482 --> 03:03:15.484
FAMILY. EXACTLY THE SAME

03:03:15.551 --> 03:03:16.952
STORIES OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

03:03:17.019 --> 03:03:18.287
COMING TO OUR SHORES TODAY. AND

03:03:18.354 --> 03:03:19.922
IT IS VERY PERSONAL FOR ME

03:03:19.988 --> 03:03:21.223
BECAUSE I STAND ON THIS FLOOR

03:03:21.290 --> 03:03:23.125
AS THE GREAT GRANDSON OF AN

03:03:23.192 --> 03:03:24.927
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT WHO CAME

03:03:24.993 --> 03:03:26.528
TO THIS COUNTRY FLEEING

03:03:26.595 --> 03:03:28.197
RELIGIOUS BIGOTRY AND WHO

03:03:28.263 --> 03:03:29.064
WORKED HIS ENTIRE LIFE HERE AS

03:03:29.131 --> 03:03:31.033
A BUTCHER, PAYING TAXES,

03:03:31.100 --> 03:03:32.267
SUPPORTING HIS FAMILY, RAISING

03:03:32.334 --> 03:03:33.969
A FAMILY. AND I REMEMBER BEING

03:03:34.036 --> 03:03:35.104
RAISED WITH STORIES FROM MY

03:03:35.170 --> 03:03:36.338
GRANDMOTHER ABOUT THE FEAR THAT

03:03:36.405 --> 03:03:38.407
HER FAMILY FACED ABOUT DOING

03:03:38.474 --> 03:03:40.075
SIMPLE THINGS LIKE TRAVELING OR

03:03:40.142 --> 03:03:42.211
GOING TO THE GROCERY STORE, OR

03:03:42.277 --> 03:03:43.011
DOING OTHER THINGS THAT OTHER

03:03:43.078 --> 03:03:44.313
FAMILIES TAKE FOR GRANTED. AND

03:03:44.380 --> 03:03:46.215
THAT IS A FEAR THAT WE ARE

03:03:46.281 --> 03:03:47.383
SEEING ECHOED TODAY IN SO MANY

03:03:47.449 --> 03:03:48.150
COMMUNITIES. SO THIS IS

03:03:48.217 --> 03:03:50.352
SOMETHING THAT IS VERY PERSONAL

03:03:50.419 --> 03:03:51.453
FOR MANY OF US, IRRESPECTIVE OF

03:03:51.520 --> 03:03:52.988
WHERE OUR FAMILIES MAY HAVE

03:03:53.055 --> 03:03:54.223
COME FROM. AND WE FIND

03:03:54.289 --> 03:03:55.491
OURSELVES AT AN INCREDIBLE

03:03:55.557 --> 03:03:57.393
MOMENT IN HISTORY AS OUR

03:03:57.459 --> 03:03:58.594
COLLEAGUE, THE AUTHOR FROM THE

03:03:58.660 --> 03:04:00.262
SAN FERNANDO VALLEY AND OTHERS

03:04:00.329 --> 03:04:01.597
HAVE SO ELOQUENTLY SPOKEN ABOUT.

03:04:01.663 --> 03:04:03.198
AND SO I BELIEVE IT IS

03:04:03.265 --> 03:04:04.967
INCUMBENT UPON ALL OF US,

03:04:05.033 --> 03:04:06.101
PARTICULARLY THOSE OF US WHO

03:04:06.168 --> 03:04:08.237
ARE BLESSED TO BE CITIZENS, TO

03:04:08.303 --> 03:04:10.005
SPEAK UP AND TO RAISE OUR

03:04:10.072 --> 03:04:11.173
VOICES, AND TO LEAN INTO THIS

03:04:11.240 --> 03:04:13.142
MOMENT AND TO REMIND PEOPLE OF

03:04:13.208 --> 03:04:14.109
OUR OWN FAMILY STORIES. BECAUSE

03:04:14.176 --> 03:04:15.644
THE TRUTH IS, OTHER THAN OUR

03:04:15.711 --> 03:04:17.146
COLLEAGUE FROM SAN BERNARDINO,

03:04:17.212 --> 03:04:18.480
ALL OF US ARE IMMIGRANTS. ALL

03:04:18.547 --> 03:04:20.082
OF US TRACE OUR HISTORY BACK TO

03:04:20.149 --> 03:04:21.316
IMMIGRANTS WHO CAME TO THESE

03:04:21.383 --> 03:04:23.352
SHORES. SO TO ME, IT IS AN

03:04:23.419 --> 03:04:25.020
IMPORTANT MOMENT FOR ALL OF US

03:04:25.087 --> 03:04:26.688
TO RAISE OUR VOICE. I WILL SAY,

03:04:26.755 --> 03:04:27.956
AS SOMEONE FROM THE SAN

03:04:28.023 --> 03:04:29.124
FERNANDO VALLEY, WHERE WE LOVE

03:04:29.191 --> 03:04:30.159
OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES,

03:04:30.225 --> 03:04:31.260
WHERE WE VALUE AND TAKE

03:04:31.326 --> 03:04:32.728
INCREDIBLE PRIDE IN OUR MIXED

03:04:32.795 --> 03:04:33.195
STATUS FAMILIES, OUR

03:04:33.262 --> 03:04:34.096
UNDOCUMENTED NEIGHBORS AND

03:04:34.163 --> 03:04:35.431
FAMILY MEMBERS AND BROTHERS AND

03:04:35.497 --> 03:04:37.132
SISTERS. I AM VERY PROUD TO

03:04:37.199 --> 03:04:39.568
LEND MY VOICE TO THIS. I WANT

03:04:39.635 --> 03:04:40.436
TO THANK OUR COLLEAGUE FOR

03:04:40.502 --> 03:04:41.303
BRINGING IT FORWARD AND, ON

03:04:41.370 --> 03:04:43.205
BEHALF OF OUR JEWISH CAUCUS,

03:04:43.272 --> 03:04:44.907
URGE A STRONG AYE VOTE ON H.J.R

03:04:44.973 --> 03:04:46.508
17. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

03:04:46.575 --> 03:04:48.710
GABRIEL, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

03:04:48.777 --> 03:04:52.748
EL-HAWARY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

03:04:52.815 --> 03:04:54.716
THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER AND

03:04:54.783 --> 03:04:57.486
MEMBERS, I JOINED MY COLLEAGUE

03:04:57.553 --> 03:04:58.220
FROM THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY

03:04:58.287 --> 03:05:00.823
AND RISE TODAY TO SPEAK IN

03:05:00.889 --> 03:05:04.960
SUPPORT OF A J R 17. DO Y'ALL

03:05:05.027 --> 03:05:06.161
REMEMBER WHEN PRESIDENT JOE

03:05:06.228 --> 03:05:08.263
BIDEN AND VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA

03:05:08.330 --> 03:05:10.098
HARRIS WERE TRYING TO ADDRESS

03:05:10.165 --> 03:05:11.433
THE BORDER CRISIS THROUGH

03:05:11.500 --> 03:05:12.434
COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION

03:05:12.501 --> 03:05:16.171
REFORM? I'M SURE YOU ALSO

03:05:16.238 --> 03:05:18.073
REMEMBER THAT TRUMP, EVEN

03:05:18.140 --> 03:05:20.108
THOUGH HE WAS OUT OF OFFICE,

03:05:20.175 --> 03:05:22.678
REPORTEDLY CALLED REPUBLICAN

03:05:22.744 --> 03:05:24.613
MEMBERS TO OF CONGRESS TO

03:05:24.680 --> 03:05:27.115
OPPOSE THE MEASURE. HIS CONCERN

03:05:27.182 --> 03:05:29.718
WAS NEVER TRULY ABOUT RESOLVING

03:05:29.785 --> 03:05:31.720
THE TRUE ISSUE, THE FACT THAT

03:05:31.787 --> 03:05:33.121
THE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IN THE

03:05:33.188 --> 03:05:36.325
UNITED STATES IS OUTDATED AND

03:05:36.391 --> 03:05:38.260
INEFFICIENT. THIS BROKEN SYSTEM

03:05:38.327 --> 03:05:40.195
HAS FORCED ASYLUM SEEKERS AND

03:05:40.262 --> 03:05:42.364
THOSE PURSUING THE AMERICAN

03:05:42.431 --> 03:05:44.867
DREAM TO RESORT TO ALTERNATIVE,

03:05:44.933 --> 03:05:47.102
OFTEN UNSAFE PATHWAYS.

03:05:47.169 --> 03:05:49.037
CURRENTLY, EVEN PEOPLE WHO ARE

03:05:49.104 --> 03:05:51.306
TRYING TO FOLLOW THE PROCESS

03:05:51.373 --> 03:05:52.374
ARE BEING DETAINED IN

03:05:52.441 --> 03:05:53.976
IMMIGRATION COURTS ACROSS THE

03:05:54.042 --> 03:05:56.745
COUNTRY BEING DISAPPEARED.

03:05:56.812 --> 03:05:57.846
WHILE TRUMP'S ACTIONS, LIKE

03:05:57.913 --> 03:06:00.816
FIRING IMMIGRATION JUDGES, HAVE

03:06:00.883 --> 03:06:04.286
WORSENED THE BACKLOG, H.J.R 17

03:06:04.353 --> 03:06:06.221
CALLS ON CONGRESS TO ACT,

03:06:06.288 --> 03:06:08.490
ENSURING THAT LONG TERM, LAW

03:06:08.557 --> 03:06:10.225
ABIDING RESIDENTS HAVE A FAIR

03:06:10.292 --> 03:06:10.993
AND ATTAINABLE PATHWAY TO

03:06:11.059 --> 03:06:14.129
LAWFUL STATUS. UNFORTUNATELY,

03:06:14.196 --> 03:06:15.430
WE CONTINUE TO SEE POLITICAL

03:06:15.497 --> 03:06:16.565
GAMESMANSHIP AND FEARMONGERING

03:06:16.632 --> 03:06:19.234
INSTEAD OF REAL SOLUTIONS. THIS

03:06:19.301 --> 03:06:22.070
IS ABOUT FAIRNESS, STABILITY,

03:06:22.137 --> 03:06:24.640
AND THE ECONOMIC HEALTH OF OUR

03:06:24.706 --> 03:06:26.074
NATION. WE CANNOT ALLOW

03:06:26.141 --> 03:06:28.510
IMMIGRATION POLICY TO BE

03:06:28.577 --> 03:06:29.645
WEAPONIZED FOR POLITICAL GAIN.

03:06:29.711 --> 03:06:31.613
WE MUST PUSH FOR REFORMS THAT

03:06:31.680 --> 03:06:34.683
REFLECT OUR VALUES AND REALITY

03:06:34.750 --> 03:06:36.585
INSTEAD OF ADVANCING REAL

03:06:36.652 --> 03:06:38.887
SOLUTIONS, SOME LEADERS CHOOSE

03:06:38.954 --> 03:06:40.055
TO MANUFACTURE CRISES FOR

03:06:40.122 --> 03:06:42.624
POLITICAL THEATER. THIS

03:06:42.691 --> 03:06:44.059
UNDERMINES TRUST, DEEPENS

03:06:44.126 --> 03:06:46.194
DIVISIONS, AND IGNORES THE

03:06:46.261 --> 03:06:49.064
HUMAN COST OF INACTION. BY

03:06:49.131 --> 03:06:51.600
TERRORIZING US WITH THESE ICE

03:06:51.667 --> 03:06:53.035
RAIDS, TRUMP IS CREATING

03:06:53.101 --> 03:06:55.437
PROBLEMS JUST SO HE CAN PRETEND

03:06:55.504 --> 03:06:58.040
TO BE THE HERO WHO FIXES THEM.

03:06:58.106 --> 03:07:00.842
WRITING IN LIKE A WHITE KNIGHT

03:07:00.909 --> 03:07:02.110
ON HIS WHITE HORSE TO BE OUR

03:07:02.177 --> 03:07:06.081
WHITE SAVIOR. THAT IS HYPOCRISY

03:07:06.148 --> 03:07:10.252
AND CRUELTY AT ITS FINEST. I

03:07:10.319 --> 03:07:13.755
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE

03:07:13.822 --> 03:07:16.725

MILLION IMMIGRANTS. THE

ONE OUT OF TEN WORKERS IN OUR

03:08:10.078 --> 03:08:12.481
YEAR. IT HAS BEEN ALMOST 40

03:08:12.547 --> 03:08:14.316
YEARS SINCE MEANINGFUL FEDERAL

03:08:14.383 --> 03:08:15.117
IMMIGRATION REFORM. WHILE

03:08:15.183 --> 03:08:17.619
MILLIONS REMAIN WITHOUT LAWFUL

03:08:17.686 --> 03:08:19.087
STATUS, CONSTRAINED BY THE

03:08:19.154 --> 03:08:20.188
OUTDATED SYSTEM, UNABLE TO

03:08:20.255 --> 03:08:22.257
ADDRESS TODAY'S REALITIES,

03:08:22.324 --> 03:08:23.158
MEANINGFUL REFORM OPPORTUNITIES

03:08:23.225 --> 03:08:26.561
HAVE BEEN REJECTED AND BLOCKED

03:08:26.628 --> 03:08:27.562
FOR DECADES. THEY CAN'T CLOSE

03:08:27.629 --> 03:08:29.264
THE DOORS AND BLAME PEOPLE FOR

03:08:29.331 --> 03:08:31.433
HAVING NO WAY IN. EVEN WHEN

03:08:31.500 --> 03:08:34.202
IMMIGRANTS TRY TO COME, QUOTE,

03:08:34.269 --> 03:08:35.404
THE RIGHT WAY, THERE ARE ICE

03:08:35.470 --> 03:08:37.506
AGENTS WAITING TO SNATCH THEM

03:08:37.572 --> 03:08:38.740
AT THEIR LEGAL APPOINTMENTS AND

03:08:38.807 --> 03:08:41.109
HEARINGS. THIS IS NOT JUSTICE.

03:08:41.176 --> 03:08:43.378
IMMIGRATION REFORM IS LONG

03:08:43.445 --> 03:08:47.549
OVERDUE. H.J.R 17 URGES OUR

03:08:47.616 --> 03:08:49.317
FEDERAL PARTNERS TO MAKE TAKE

03:08:49.384 --> 03:08:51.119
ACTION BY ALLOWING UNDOCUMENTED

03:08:51.186 --> 03:08:52.688
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE LIVED

03:08:52.754 --> 03:08:54.056
CONTINUOUSLY IN THE US FOR AT

LEAST SEVEN YEARS TO APPLY FOR

03:08:56.324 --> 03:08:58.493
LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENCY. MY

03:08:58.560 --> 03:09:00.595
PARENTS CAME TO THIS COUNTRY

03:09:00.662 --> 03:09:02.597
FROM LEON, GUANAJUATO TO BUILD

03:09:02.664 --> 03:09:04.132
A BETTER LIFE FOR OUR FAMILY. I

03:09:04.199 --> 03:09:05.300
REPRESENT LARGE IMMIGRANT

03:09:05.367 --> 03:09:06.835
COMMUNITY IN SOUTHEAST LOS

03:09:06.902 --> 03:09:08.537
ANGELES. IMMIGRANTS ARE THE

03:09:08.603 --> 03:09:10.205
NEIGHBORS, FRIENDS, AND SMALL

03:09:10.272 --> 03:09:12.407
BUSINESS OWNERS THAT MAKE OUR

03:09:12.474 --> 03:09:14.209
COMMUNITIES HOME. FAIR AND

03:09:14.276 --> 03:09:15.977
HUMANE. IMMIGRATION REFORMS

03:09:16.044 --> 03:09:17.612
ALIGNS WITH OUR VALUES AND

03:09:17.679 --> 03:09:19.614
SUPPORT OUR PROSPERITY. ON

03:09:19.681 --> 03:09:21.083
BEHALF OF THE LGBTQ CAUCUS, I

03:09:21.149 --> 03:09:23.151
AM PROUD TO JOIN MY COLLEAGUES

03:09:23.218 --> 03:09:24.686
IN SUPPORTING THIS RESOLUTION

03:09:24.753 --> 03:09:25.854
AND CALLING FOR MEANINGFUL,

03:09:25.921 --> 03:09:27.222
HUMANE REFORM. THANK YOU,

03:09:27.289 --> 03:09:28.356
SPEAKER AND MEMBERS, I

03:09:28.423 --> 03:09:31.026
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

03:09:31.093 --> 03:09:33.228
THANK YOU, ASSEMBLY MEMBERS,

03:09:33.295 --> 03:09:35.030
ASSEMBLY MEMBER SORIA, YOU ARE

03:09:35.097 --> 03:09:37.132
RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MR.

03:09:37.199 --> 03:09:38.366
SPEAKER. AND MEMBERS, I RISE

03:09:38.433 --> 03:09:41.470
TODAY AS A PROUD COAUTHOR OF AJ

03:09:41.536 --> 03:09:45.373
17, ASKING AND DEMANDING OUR

03:09:45.440 --> 03:09:46.508
CONGRESS TO REFORM OUR

03:09:46.575 --> 03:09:49.644
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. IT'S ABOUT

03:09:49.711 --> 03:09:51.747
TIME AND WE MUST STOP

03:09:51.813 --> 03:09:54.683
POLITICIZING THIS ISSUE, AND WE

03:09:54.750 --> 03:09:56.585
MUST STOP POLITICIZING AND

03:09:56.651 --> 03:09:58.687
TERRORIZING OUR FAMILIES ACROSS

03:09:58.754 --> 03:10:00.288
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND

03:10:00.355 --> 03:10:03.158
THIS NATION WHO CONTINUE TO

03:10:03.225 --> 03:10:04.960
MAKE POSITIVE CONTRIBUTIONS NOT

03:10:05.026 --> 03:10:07.696
JUST TO THIS GREAT STATE, BUT

03:10:07.763 --> 03:10:09.364
TO THIS GREAT COUNTRY. I RISE

03:10:09.431 --> 03:10:11.066
TODAY BECAUSE IN MY DISTRICT,

03:10:11.133 --> 03:10:13.969
WE ARE HOME TO THOUSANDS OF

03:10:14.035 --> 03:10:15.370
IMMIGRANTS THAT THE FEDERAL

03:10:15.437 --> 03:10:17.472
GOVERNMENT CLASSIFIED AS

03:10:17.539 --> 03:10:19.274
ESSENTIAL AND WHO TODAY

03:10:19.341 --> 03:10:21.243
CONTINUE TO WAKE UP VERY EARLY

03:10:21.309 --> 03:10:24.646
TO BEAT THE HEAT, TO PICK THE

03:10:24.713 --> 03:10:26.481
FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THAT YOU

03:10:26.548 --> 03:10:27.449
AND I GET THE PRIVILEGE OF

03:10:27.516 --> 03:10:28.950
BUYING AT OUR LOCAL GROCERY

03:10:29.017 --> 03:10:31.653
STORES. BUT TODAY THEY LIVE IN

03:10:31.720 --> 03:10:34.189
FEAR. THIS ISSUE, TO ME, IS

03:10:34.256 --> 03:10:35.991
VERY PERSONAL. I WOULDN'T BE

03:10:36.057 --> 03:10:38.193
STANDING HERE IF IT WEREN'T FOR

03:10:38.260 --> 03:10:40.462
THE TWO BRAVE FARMWORKERS. MY

03:10:40.529 --> 03:10:43.031
PARENTS, JOSE AND MARIA SORIA,

03:10:43.098 --> 03:10:46.301
WHO CAME TO THIS COUNTRY. YES,

03:10:46.368 --> 03:10:48.703
UNDOCUMENTED AS TEENAGERS,

03:10:48.770 --> 03:10:50.438
DRIVEN BY THE DREAM OF GIVING

03:10:50.505 --> 03:10:53.208
THEIR CHILDREN A BETTER FUTURE.

03:10:53.275 --> 03:10:55.410
LIKE SO MANY FAMILIES IN THE

03:10:55.477 --> 03:10:57.546
CENTRAL VALLEY, THEY CAME TO

03:10:57.612 --> 03:11:00.015
WORK HARD NOT TO CAUSE HARM.

03:11:00.081 --> 03:11:03.118
AND YET, DECADES LATER, OUR

03:11:03.185 --> 03:11:06.054
FAMILIES ARE SCARED AGAIN.

03:11:06.121 --> 03:11:08.290
SCARED TO GO TO THE STORE,

03:11:08.356 --> 03:11:10.525
SCARED TO GO TO THE DOCTOR, TO

03:11:10.592 --> 03:11:14.029
SIMPLY LIVE THEIR LIVES. I WILL

03:11:14.095 --> 03:11:15.263
TELL YOU. AND I'VE SHARED THIS

03:11:15.330 --> 03:11:16.998
STORY WITH OTHERS. I EVEN CARRY

03:11:17.065 --> 03:11:20.135
MY PASSPORT NOWADAYS. YOU GUYS

03:11:20.202 --> 03:11:21.436
PROBABLY READ THE LA TIMES

03:11:21.503 --> 03:11:24.439
ARTICLE THAT SAID TODAY MANY OF

03:11:24.506 --> 03:11:27.075
US ARE SCARED TO BE BROWN. OUR

03:11:27.142 --> 03:11:29.978
FAMILY HAS ALREADY EXPERIENCED

03:11:30.045 --> 03:11:32.147
DEPORTATION. ONCE WHEN I WAS

03:11:32.214 --> 03:11:34.482
YOUNG, MY FATHER SHARED HIS

03:11:34.549 --> 03:11:36.284
STORY OF BEING DEPORTED. IT WAS

03:11:36.351 --> 03:11:39.221
PAINFUL AND IT WAS FRIGHTENING.

03:11:39.287 --> 03:11:41.122
WE THOUGHT THOSE DAYS WERE

03:11:41.189 --> 03:11:43.325
BEHIND US. AFTER ALL, AS MANY

03:11:43.391 --> 03:11:46.461
OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE STATED,

03:11:46.528 --> 03:11:49.297
PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN, YES, A

03:11:49.364 --> 03:11:51.700
REPUBLICAN, ENACTED IMMIGRATION

03:11:51.766 --> 03:11:53.969
REFORM IN 1986, WHICH GRANTED

03:11:54.035 --> 03:11:57.172
MY TWO IMMIGRANT PARENTS

03:11:57.239 --> 03:11:59.441
AMNESTY, ALONG WITH MILLIONS OF

03:11:59.507 --> 03:12:01.309
HARDWORKING IMMIGRANTS IN THIS

03:12:01.376 --> 03:12:04.312
COUNTRY. THAT'S WHAT LEADERSHIP

03:12:04.379 --> 03:12:06.948
LOOKS LIKE. WE NEED THAT KIND

03:12:07.015 --> 03:12:09.651
OF COURAGE AGAIN. AND THESE

03:12:09.718 --> 03:12:13.021
DEPORTATIONS AS WELL MUST STOP.

03:12:13.088 --> 03:12:14.289
I HAVE HEARD IT FROM DIRECTLY

03:12:14.356 --> 03:12:16.057
IN MY DISTRICT, FROM

03:12:16.124 --> 03:12:18.660
AGRICULTURE PRODUCERS,

03:12:18.727 --> 03:12:19.961
PACKINGHOUSE OPERATORS AND

03:12:20.028 --> 03:12:21.162
OTHER BUSINESS OWNERS ACROSS

03:12:21.229 --> 03:12:23.331
OUR VALLEY. THEY ARE WORRIED

03:12:23.398 --> 03:12:25.433
ABOUT THE FUTURE BECAUSE THEY

03:12:25.500 --> 03:12:29.304
KNOW, JUST LIKE WE DO, THAT

03:12:29.371 --> 03:12:30.138
IMMIGRANTS ARE ESSENTIAL TO OUR

03:12:30.205 --> 03:12:33.842
ECONOMY. WITHOUT THEM, THE

03:12:33.909 --> 03:12:35.076
CROPS DON'T GET HARVESTED.

03:12:35.143 --> 03:12:37.245
ACTUALLY, THEY WILL ROT.

03:12:37.312 --> 03:12:40.382
BUSINESSES CAN'T STAY OPEN AND

03:12:40.448 --> 03:12:42.250
ENTIRE COMMUNITIES WILL SUFFER.

03:12:42.317 --> 03:12:45.453
THEY TOO, SUPPORT COMPREHENSIVE

03:12:45.520 --> 03:12:48.623
IMMIGRATION REFORM. WE NEED A

03:12:48.690 --> 03:12:49.124
CONGRESS THAT WILL COME

03:12:49.190 --> 03:12:50.692
TOGETHER TO CREATE A REAL

03:12:50.759 --> 03:12:52.627
PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP FOR

03:12:52.694 --> 03:12:54.296
IMMIGRANTS WHO HAVE CONTRIBUTED

03:12:54.362 --> 03:12:57.999
FOR YEARS. AND LET'S BE CLEAR,

03:12:58.066 --> 03:13:00.335
THIS BROKEN SYSTEM IS HURTING

03:13:00.402 --> 03:13:03.071
OUR STATE'S ECONOMY. FROM THE

03:13:03.138 --> 03:13:06.408
FIELDS TO THE CITIES, THOSE ICE

03:13:06.474 --> 03:13:08.109
AGENTS DON'T BELONG IN OUR

03:13:08.176 --> 03:13:09.778
SCHOOLS. THEY DON'T BELONG IN

03:13:09.844 --> 03:13:11.179
OUR CHURCHES. THEY DON'T BELONG

03:13:11.246 --> 03:13:13.648
IN PEOPLE'S HOMES. THEY DON'T

03:13:13.715 --> 03:13:16.384
BELONG INSIDE THOSE BUSINESSES.

03:13:16.451 --> 03:13:20.722
IF WE DON'T ACT NOW, WHEN WILL

03:13:20.789 --> 03:13:22.958
WE ACT? I WILL KEEP FIGHTING

03:13:23.024 --> 03:13:26.127
FOR IMMIGRATION REFORM BECAUSE

03:13:26.194 --> 03:13:28.363
IT'S ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE

03:13:28.430 --> 03:13:30.265
AND THE FUTURE OF THE CENTRAL

03:13:30.332 --> 03:13:32.467
VALLEY. BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE

03:13:32.534 --> 03:13:34.269
FUTURE OF THE UNITED STATES OF

03:13:34.336 --> 03:13:37.339
AMERICA. IT DEPENDS ON IT. I

03:13:37.405 --> 03:13:39.174
RISE TODAY AND ASK ALL OF YOU

03:13:39.240 --> 03:13:43.078
TO VOTE IN SUPPORT OF AG 17.

03:13:43.144 --> 03:13:45.613
THANK YOU, ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU,

03:13:50.452 --> 03:13:53.088
MR. CHAIR. I THINK MOST OF US

03:13:53.154 --> 03:13:54.923
WOULD AGREE. THE MOST VALUABLE

03:13:54.990 --> 03:13:56.524
THING WE COULD DO TO STRENGTHEN

03:13:56.591 --> 03:13:58.460
AMERICA IS TO STRENGTHEN

03:13:58.526 --> 03:14:00.128
AMERICA'S FAMILIES. AND TODAY,

03:14:00.195 --> 03:14:03.365
THERE ARE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS

03:14:03.431 --> 03:14:06.301
THAT LIVE IN MIXED IMMIGRATION

03:14:06.368 --> 03:14:08.236
STATUS, FAMILIES. SPLITTING

03:14:08.303 --> 03:14:10.538
THOSE FAMILIES APART WEAKENS

03:14:10.605 --> 03:14:12.474
AMERICA, AND BINDING THOSE

03:14:12.540 --> 03:14:14.809
FAMILIES TOGETHER AND GIVING

03:14:14.876 --> 03:14:16.177
THEM THE SECURITY THAT THEY

03:14:16.244 --> 03:14:18.146
NEED TO HAVE TO HOLD THEIR

03:14:18.213 --> 03:14:19.581
FAMILY TOGETHER AND BE GREAT

03:14:19.647 --> 03:14:22.317
CONTRIBUTORS TO AMERICA,

03:14:22.384 --> 03:14:25.220
REQUIRES IMMIGRATION REFORM FOR

03:14:25.286 --> 03:14:26.421
POLITICAL REASONS. WE HAVE

03:14:26.488 --> 03:14:28.089
STOOD IN THE WAY OF THE

03:14:28.156 --> 03:14:30.158
IMMIGRATION REFORM WE NEED.

03:14:30.225 --> 03:14:31.659
WE'VE STOOD IN THE WAY OF A

03:14:31.726 --> 03:14:33.495
PATH TO CITIZENSHIP. IF YOU

03:14:33.561 --> 03:14:35.296
CARE ABOUT THE STRENGTH OF

03:14:35.363 --> 03:14:37.165
AMERICA, YOU CARE ABOUT THE

03:14:37.232 --> 03:14:39.300
STRENGTH OF OUR FAMILIES. YOU

03:14:39.367 --> 03:14:41.002
CARE ABOUT THE STRENGTH OF OUR

03:14:41.069 --> 03:14:43.304
IMMIGRANT FAMILIES. I STRONGLY

03:14:43.371 --> 03:14:46.207

URGENT NEED FOR FEDERAL ACTION.

03:15:07.395 --> 03:15:09.097
CALIFORNIA MUST REAFFIRM ITS

JUST STATISTICS. THEY ARE LIVES

03:17:29.204 --> 03:17:31.339
FOREVER CHANGED BY HARM THAT

03:17:31.406 --> 03:17:33.741
COULD AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN

03:17:33.808 --> 03:17:36.110

ASSASSINATED FOR THEIR

03:17:51.826 --> 03:17:53.228

03:17:53.294 --> 03:17:55.763
THEIR COURAGE IS A POWERFUL

03:17:55.830 --> 03:17:56.731
REMINDER THAT GENDER BASED

03:17:56.798 --> 03:17:59.133
VIOLENCE IS NOT ONLY A PERSONAL

03:17:59.200 --> 03:18:02.570
ISSUE, IT'S POLITICAL, AND

03:18:02.637 --> 03:18:06.107

WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE UNITED

03:19:27.755 --> 03:19:29.390
NATIONS TO HONOR THE MIRABAL

03:19:29.457 --> 03:19:31.626
SISTERS, WHO WERE BRAVE

03:19:31.693 --> 03:19:32.327
POLITICAL ACTIVISTS FROM THE

03:19:32.393 --> 03:19:34.462
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC WHO WERE

03:19:34.529 --> 03:19:36.230
ASSASSINATED UNDER BRUTAL

03:19:36.297 --> 03:19:38.299
REGIME. WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE

03:19:38.366 --> 03:19:40.401
THAT VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND

03:19:40.468 --> 03:19:41.936
GIRLS IS A DEVASTATING GLOBAL

03:19:42.003 --> 03:19:44.038
ISSUE, IMPACTING MILLIONS AND

03:19:44.105 --> 03:19:46.207
DEMANDING URGENT ACTION. THE

03:19:46.274 --> 03:19:48.142
STATISTIC THAT 1 IN 1 WOMAN IS

03:19:48.209 --> 03:19:50.445
KILLED EVERY TEN MINUTES

03:19:50.511 --> 03:19:51.713
HIGHLIGHTS THE SEVERITY OF THIS

03:19:51.779 --> 03:19:55.616
CRISIS. IN OUR OWN STATE, 86%

03:19:55.683 --> 03:19:56.984

03:19:57.051 --> 03:19:59.354
SOME SORT OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT

03:19:59.420 --> 03:20:01.956
OR ASSAULT IN THEIR LIFETIME.

03:20:02.023 --> 03:20:03.458
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN

03:20:03.524 --> 03:20:04.392
ENCOMPASSES VARIOUS FORMS,

03:20:04.459 --> 03:20:06.327
INCLUDING PHYSICAL,

03:20:06.394 --> 03:20:08.162
PSYCHOLOGICAL, SEXUAL, AND

03:20:08.229 --> 03:20:10.298
FINANCIAL ABUSE. THIS BROADER

03:20:10.365 --> 03:20:12.100
UNDERSTANDING HELPS US

03:20:12.166 --> 03:20:13.334
RECOGNIZE THE MANY DIMENSIONS

03:20:13.401 --> 03:20:17.105
OF HARM THAT WOMEN FACE. WOMEN

03:20:17.171 --> 03:20:21.042
OF COLOR, IMMIGRANT WOMEN, AND

03:20:21.109 --> 03:20:23.010
LGBTQ. PLUS WOMEN FACE EVEN

03:20:23.077 --> 03:20:26.114
HIGHER RATES OF VIOLENCE. IT

03:20:26.180 --> 03:20:29.250
LEAVES DEEP SCARS ON CHILDREN,

03:20:29.317 --> 03:20:31.452
ON FAMILIES, ON COMMUNITIES,

03:20:31.519 --> 03:20:34.288
AND ON SOCIETY AS A WHOLE. IT

03:20:34.355 --> 03:20:36.224
DISRUPTS EDUCATION, EMPLOYMENT

03:20:36.290 --> 03:20:39.127
AND CREATES CYCLES OF FEAR AND

03:20:39.193 --> 03:20:41.229
SILENCE THAT CAN PERSIST ACROSS

03:20:41.295 --> 03:20:43.164
GENERATIONS TO ELIMINATE

03:20:43.231 --> 03:20:45.199
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN, A

03:20:45.266 --> 03:20:47.034
CULTURAL TRANSFORMATION.

03:20:47.101 --> 03:20:49.137
CULTURAL TRANSFORMATION IS

03:20:49.203 --> 03:20:51.072
NECESSARY BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST

03:20:51.139 --> 03:20:54.609
ABOUT POLICY REFORM. WE NEED TO

03:20:54.675 --> 03:20:56.344
CHANGE SOCIETAL NORMS AND POWER

03:20:56.411 --> 03:20:57.111
STRUCTURES THAT NORMALIZE AND

03:20:57.178 --> 03:20:58.780
PERPETUATE THIS TYPE OF

03:20:58.846 --> 03:21:01.215
VIOLENCE. SO LET US STAND

03:21:01.282 --> 03:21:03.184
TOGETHER AND HONOR THE COURAGE

03:21:03.251 --> 03:21:04.986

03:21:05.052 --> 03:21:07.188
SISTERS AND THE WOMEN IN OUR

03:21:07.255 --> 03:21:08.389
LIVES OUR MOTHERS, SISTERS,

03:21:08.456 --> 03:21:09.490
DAUGHTERS, FRIENDS AND

03:21:09.557 --> 03:21:11.592
NEIGHBORS. THIS RESOLUTION IS

03:21:11.659 --> 03:21:12.693
AN AFFIRMATION OF OUR

03:21:12.760 --> 03:21:15.463
COMMITMENT TO CREATING A SAFER,

03:21:15.530 --> 03:21:17.298
MORE EQUITABLE WORLD. AND WITH

03:21:17.365 --> 03:21:19.033
THAT, I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR

03:21:19.100 --> 03:21:21.135
YOUR VOTE FOR A STRONGER, SAFER,

03:21:21.202 --> 03:21:23.604

THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

03:21:26.107 --> 03:21:29.076
MEMBER, ASSEMBLY MEMBER. LACKEY,

YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. YOU MAY

03:21:31.846 --> 03:21:34.148
WONDER WHY I'M STANDING AND I'M

03:21:34.215 --> 03:21:36.050
JUST GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU A

03:21:36.117 --> 03:21:38.453
VERY PERSONAL STORY THAT

03:21:38.519 --> 03:21:42.457
HAPPENED SOME TIME AGO. I

03:21:42.523 --> 03:21:45.726
RECEIVED A MESSAGE ON MY PHONE

03:21:45.793 --> 03:21:48.596
FROM A PERSON THAT WAS IN MY

03:21:48.663 --> 03:21:51.732
COMMUNITY THAT HAPPENED TO KNOW

03:21:51.799 --> 03:21:55.036
THAT I HAD INTEREST IN IN

03:21:55.102 --> 03:21:57.271
PUBLIC SAFETY. SHE SENT ME A

03:21:57.338 --> 03:21:58.973
PICTURE OF HER, AND THIS WAS

03:21:59.040 --> 03:22:01.175
RIGHT AROUND CHRISTMAS TIME.

03:22:01.242 --> 03:22:05.913
AND. SHE WAS INJURED. SHE

03:22:05.980 --> 03:22:08.516
SHOWED ME THE PICTURE. THAT WAS

03:22:08.583 --> 03:22:10.218
A DAY AFTER AN INCIDENT THAT

03:22:10.284 --> 03:22:13.020
HAD OCCURRED WITH HER SPOUSE,

03:22:13.087 --> 03:22:15.590
AND SHE HAD INDICATED THAT SHE

03:22:15.656 --> 03:22:18.292
WAS VERY SCARED AND DIDN'T KNOW

03:22:18.359 --> 03:22:22.263
WHAT TO DO. AND OF COURSE, WITH

03:22:22.330 --> 03:22:26.467
MY. MANDATE TO ACTUALLY REPORT

03:22:26.534 --> 03:22:29.670
THE INCIDENT, I DID, AND I HAD

03:22:29.737 --> 03:22:32.073
LAW ENFORCEMENT GO TO THAT

03:22:32.139 --> 03:22:36.010
ADDRESS AND PLACED THE HUSBAND

03:22:36.077 --> 03:22:38.346
UNDER ARREST. THE REASON WHY

03:22:38.412 --> 03:22:41.716
I'M SHARING YOU THIS STORY IS

03:22:41.782 --> 03:22:44.051
BECAUSE ABOUT SIX WEEKS LATER

03:22:44.118 --> 03:22:48.689
WENT TO COURT. AND THE WIFE

03:22:48.756 --> 03:22:51.792
PLED PLEAD WITH ME TO NOT

03:22:51.859 --> 03:22:54.495
TESTIFY. WE HAVE A REAL PROBLEM

03:22:54.562 --> 03:22:57.999
IN OUR SOCIETY WITH THESE WOMEN.

03:22:58.065 --> 03:23:01.936
THEY FEEL TRAPPED. THEY FEEL

03:23:02.003 --> 03:23:06.007
DESPERATE. AND EVEN AFTER THE

03:23:06.073 --> 03:23:08.376
APPROPRIATE ACTION IS TAKEN,

03:23:08.442 --> 03:23:09.410
THEY'RE STILL VERY, VERY

03:23:09.477 --> 03:23:12.179
FEARFUL. OUR SOCIETY HAS A LONG

03:23:12.246 --> 03:23:14.448
WAY TO GO ON THIS, AND I WANT

03:23:14.515 --> 03:23:16.050
YOU TO KNOW THAT I'LL NEVER

03:23:16.117 --> 03:23:18.519
FORGET THAT. I WILL NEVER

03:23:18.586 --> 03:23:21.722
FORGET THE SADNESS THAT I FELT,

03:23:21.789 --> 03:23:23.257
NOT ONLY FROM THE INJURY. HE

03:23:23.324 --> 03:23:26.127
BROKE THE ORACLE IN HER EYE. IT

03:23:26.193 --> 03:23:28.462
WAS VERY SEVERE. I STILL HAVE

03:23:28.529 --> 03:23:31.732
THAT IMAGE IN MY MIND. IT'S

03:23:31.799 --> 03:23:35.069
TERRIBLE. AND THE FACT THAT SHE

03:23:35.136 --> 03:23:37.405
FELT THAT SHE DIDN'T WANT ANY

03:23:37.471 --> 03:23:40.207
ACTION TAKEN AGAINST HER SPOUSE

03:23:40.274 --> 03:23:41.876
IS ALSO VERY TELLING OF THE

03:23:41.943 --> 03:23:44.278
FEAR. I HOPE THAT WE'LL DO A

03:23:44.345 --> 03:23:46.914
BETTER JOB AND THIS REALLY

03:23:46.981 --> 03:23:49.183
DESERVES ATTENTION. THANK YOU.

03:23:49.250 --> 03:23:50.518
THANK YOU, ASSEMBLY MEMBER

03:23:50.585 --> 03:23:53.421

FURTHER DEBATE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

03:23:55.056 --> 03:23:57.091
STEPHANI, DO YOU WISH TO CLOSE?

03:23:57.158 --> 03:23:58.993
THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. I WANT

03:23:59.060 --> 03:24:01.028

03:24:01.095 --> 03:24:02.763

FROM PALMDALE FOR SHARING THAT

03:24:05.199 --> 03:24:07.368
STORY. I THINK YOU NAILED IT IN

03:24:07.435 --> 03:24:09.036
TERMS OF THE EXPERIENCE OF A

03:24:09.103 --> 03:24:11.973
WOMAN WHO'S TRYING TO LEAVE AN

03:24:12.039 --> 03:24:13.608
ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP AND THE

03:27:39.947 --> 03:27:40.414
ON AN ISSUE THAT IS DEEPLY

03:27:40.481 --> 03:27:42.950
PAINFUL BUT IMPOSSIBLE TO

03:27:43.017 --> 03:27:44.819
IGNORE. MILITARY SEXUAL TRAUMA,

03:27:44.885 --> 03:27:47.087
OR MST IS SOMETHING THAT FAR

03:27:47.154 --> 03:27:48.956
TOO MANY OF OUR SERVICE MEMBERS

03:27:49.023 --> 03:27:51.091
HAVE ENDURED. IT ENCOMPASSES

03:27:51.158 --> 03:27:53.294
SEXUAL ASSAULT AND REPEATED

03:27:53.360 --> 03:27:53.994
THREATENING SEXUAL HARASSMENT

03:27:54.061 --> 03:27:56.197
DURING MILITARY SERVICE. THE

03:27:56.263 --> 03:27:58.666
STATS ARE STAGGERING AND

03:27:58.732 --> 03:28:01.602
HEARTBREAKING. RESEARCH SHOWS

03:28:01.669 --> 03:28:03.137
THAT 1 IN 3 WOMEN AND ONE IN 1

03:28:03.204 --> 03:28:05.306
IN 50 MEN EXPERIENCED MILITARY

03:28:05.372 --> 03:28:07.074
SEXUAL TRAUMA AT SOME POINT IN

03:28:07.141 --> 03:28:08.275
THEIR SERVICE, WHETHER ON

03:28:08.342 --> 03:28:10.177
ACTIVE DUTY, IN RESERVE OR IN

03:28:10.244 --> 03:28:12.179
THE NATIONAL GUARD. BEHIND EACH

03:28:12.246 --> 03:28:14.081
NUMBER IS A PERSON WHO

03:28:14.148 --> 03:28:15.416
VOLUNTEERED TO SERVE THIS

03:28:15.482 --> 03:28:17.251
COUNTRY, WHO PUT ON A UNIFORM

03:28:17.318 --> 03:28:19.553
WITH PRIDE, AND WHO EXPECTED TO

03:28:19.620 --> 03:28:20.955
BE PROTECTED AND REPRESENTED

03:28:21.021 --> 03:28:23.390
WITHIN THEIR RANKS. MILITARY

03:28:23.457 --> 03:28:25.426
SEXUAL TRAUMA IS NOT ONLY A

03:28:25.492 --> 03:28:27.161
DIAGNOSIS OR A MEDICAL

03:28:27.228 --> 03:28:29.964
CONDITION, IT IS AN EXPERIENCE.

03:28:30.030 --> 03:28:32.166
IT IS ONE THAT CAN CHANGE THE

03:28:32.233 --> 03:28:34.268
ENTIRE COURSE OF SOMEONE'S LIFE.

03:28:34.335 --> 03:28:36.003
SURVIVORS OF MILITARY SEXUAL

03:28:36.070 --> 03:28:37.471
TRAUMA CARRY LASTING WOUNDS

03:28:37.538 --> 03:28:40.074
THAT CAN SHOW UP IN MANY FORMS,

03:28:40.140 --> 03:28:42.243
SUCH AS POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS

03:28:42.309 --> 03:28:45.112
DISORDER, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY,

03:28:45.179 --> 03:28:47.481
SUBSTANCE USE, PHYSICAL HEALTH

03:28:47.548 --> 03:28:49.350
CHALLENGES, AND TRAGICALLY, AN

03:28:49.416 --> 03:28:52.419
INCREASED RISK OF SUICIDE. IT

03:28:52.486 --> 03:28:54.255
IS NOT JUST THE SURVIVOR WHO IS

03:28:54.321 --> 03:28:57.324
AFFECTED. THE IMPACT RIPPLES

03:28:57.391 --> 03:28:59.126
OUTWARD TO FAMILIES, FRIENDS

03:28:59.193 --> 03:29:01.328
AND FELLOW SERVICE MEMBERS.

03:29:01.395 --> 03:29:04.131
RELATIONSHIPS SUFFER, TRUST IS

03:29:04.198 --> 03:29:05.466
BROKEN, AND THE READINESS OF

03:29:05.532 --> 03:29:07.167
OUR MILITARY ITSELF IS

03:29:07.234 --> 03:29:09.303
COMPROMISED. IT IS ALSO

03:29:09.370 --> 03:29:11.205
IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE

03:29:11.272 --> 03:29:14.608
HARM IS NOT FELT. EQUALLY,

03:29:14.675 --> 03:29:15.242
SURVIVORS FROM MARGINALIZED AND

03:29:15.309 --> 03:29:17.278
MINORITY COMMUNITIES OFTEN FACE

03:29:17.344 --> 03:29:19.213
ADDITIONAL BARRIERS. WHEN THEY

03:29:19.280 --> 03:29:21.048
SEEK HELP, THEY MAY EXPERIENCE

03:29:21.115 --> 03:29:24.351
RACISM, SEXISM, HOMOPHOBIA, AND

03:29:24.418 --> 03:29:26.053
OTHER FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION

03:29:26.120 --> 03:29:28.155
ON TOP OF THE TRAUMA THEY HAVE

03:29:28.222 --> 03:29:30.224
ALREADY CARRIED. AND TOO OFTEN,

03:29:30.291 --> 03:29:31.425
WHEN SURVIVORS FINALLY GATHER

03:29:31.492 --> 03:29:33.494
THE COURAGE TO ASK FOR SUPPORT,

03:29:33.560 --> 03:29:36.163
THEY ARE MET WITH INDIFFERENCE,

03:29:36.230 --> 03:29:39.767
DISRESPECT OR WORSE, THEY ARE

03:29:39.833 --> 03:29:41.335
RETRAUMATIZED BY THE VERY

03:29:41.402 --> 03:29:43.570
SYSTEM THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO

03:29:43.637 --> 03:29:46.373
PROTECT THEM. WE ALSO HAVE TO

03:29:46.440 --> 03:29:48.175
ACKNOWLEDGE SOMETHING DIFFERENT

03:29:48.242 --> 03:29:50.210
AND DIFFICULT, BUT YET IS TRUE.

03:29:50.277 --> 03:29:52.012
THE UNIQUE AND COMPLICATED

03:29:52.079 --> 03:29:53.247
NATURE OF MILITARY

03:29:53.314 --> 03:29:55.182
RELATIONSHIPS MAKE THESE

03:29:55.249 --> 03:29:57.351
SITUATIONS ESPECIALLY

03:29:57.418 --> 03:29:59.186
DEVASTATING. MILITARY SEXUAL

03:29:59.253 --> 03:30:01.155
TRAUMA CAN INVOLVE ABUSE OF

03:30:01.221 --> 03:30:03.424
POWER THAT IS RARELY SEEN IN

03:30:03.490 --> 03:30:05.159
CIVILIAN LIFE, INCLUDING WHAT

03:30:05.225 --> 03:30:06.193
SOME SURVIVORS REFER TO AS

03:30:06.260 --> 03:30:10.764
COMMAND RAPE, WHERE THE

03:30:10.831 --> 03:30:11.265
PERPETRATOR HOLDS DIRECT

03:30:11.332 --> 03:30:13.734
AUTHORITY OVER THE VICTIM.

03:30:13.801 --> 03:30:15.235
THESE DYNAMICS OF RANK AND

03:30:15.302 --> 03:30:17.271
COMMAND CAN LEAVE SURVIVORS

03:30:17.338 --> 03:30:19.073
FEELING TRAPPED, POWERLESS, AND

03:30:19.139 --> 03:30:21.809
SILENCED. TOO OFTEN, THE

03:30:21.875 --> 03:30:24.111
STANDARD SERVICE AVAILABLE TO

03:30:24.178 --> 03:30:26.246
SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVORS DO NOT

03:30:26.313 --> 03:30:28.015
FULLY MEET THE COMPLEX NEEDS OF

03:30:28.082 --> 03:30:29.650
VETERANS AND SERVICE MEMBERS,

03:30:29.717 --> 03:30:31.218
SO WE CANNOT LOOK AWAY FROM

03:30:31.285 --> 03:30:34.655
THIS REALITY. BUT THIS IS THIS

03:30:34.722 --> 03:30:37.491
IS WHY THIS RESOLUTION MATTERS.

03:30:37.558 --> 03:30:40.361
BY PROCLAIMING SEPTEMBER 25TH,

03:30:40.427 --> 03:30:42.329
2025 AS MILITARY SEXUAL TRAUMA

03:30:42.396 --> 03:30:44.298
AWARENESS DAY, WE ARE DOING

03:30:44.365 --> 03:30:45.165
MORE THAN SETTING ASIDE A DATE

03:30:45.232 --> 03:30:48.235
ON THIS CALENDAR. WE ARE MAKING

03:30:48.302 --> 03:30:49.903
A PROMISE TO SURVIVORS THAT

03:30:49.970 --> 03:30:51.205
THEY ARE SEEN, THAT THEY ARE

03:30:51.271 --> 03:30:53.574
HEARD, AND THAT THEY ARE NOT

03:30:53.640 --> 03:30:55.609
ALONE. WE ARE COMMITTING

03:30:55.676 --> 03:30:56.243
OURSELVES TO BREAKING THE

03:30:56.310 --> 03:30:58.245
STIGMA AROUND MILITARY SEXUAL

03:30:58.312 --> 03:30:59.246
TRAUMA, SO THAT NO ONE FEELS

03:30:59.313 --> 03:31:02.683
SHAME IN COMING FORWARD. WE ARE

03:31:02.750 --> 03:31:04.685
AFFIRMING THE NEED FOR

03:31:04.752 --> 03:31:06.153
COMPASSION, TRAUMA INFORMED

03:31:06.220 --> 03:31:07.254
CARE THAT TREATS EVERY SURVIVOR

03:31:07.321 --> 03:31:09.256
WITH DIGNITY AND THE UTMOST

03:31:09.323 --> 03:31:11.792
RESPECT. AND WE ARE REMINDING

03:31:11.859 --> 03:31:14.128
OURSELVES THAT PREVENTION MUST

03:31:14.194 --> 03:31:16.563
REMAIN ONE OF OUR TOP

03:31:16.630 --> 03:31:18.699
PRIORITIES. A CULTURE OF ZERO

03:31:18.766 --> 03:31:19.933
TOLERANCE, STRENGTHENED

03:31:20.000 --> 03:31:22.002
REPORTING SYSTEMS AND

03:31:22.069 --> 03:31:23.704
COMPREHENSIVE TRAINING ARE NOT

03:31:23.771 --> 03:31:26.140
OPTIONAL. THESE THINGS ARE

03:31:26.206 --> 03:31:28.142
ESSENTIAL TO PROTECT OUR

03:31:28.208 --> 03:31:29.777
SERVICE MEMBERS AND TO UPHOLD

03:31:29.843 --> 03:31:31.111
THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ARMED

03:31:31.178 --> 03:31:33.280
FORCES. COLLEAGUES. THIS IS NOT

03:31:33.347 --> 03:31:36.050
A DISTANT PROBLEM. SURVIVORS

03:31:36.116 --> 03:31:37.317
LIVE IN OUR DISTRICTS. THEY ARE

03:31:37.384 --> 03:31:39.053
OUR NEIGHBORS. THEY ARE OUR

03:31:39.119 --> 03:31:41.488
CONSTITUENTS. AND IN MANY CASES,

03:31:41.555 --> 03:31:42.456
THEY ARE OUR FAMILIES MEMBERS.

03:31:42.523 --> 03:31:45.092
AND THEY ARE OUR FRIENDS. THEIR

03:31:45.159 --> 03:31:46.827
STRENGTH IN THE FACE OF WHAT

03:31:46.894 --> 03:31:47.995
THEY HAVE ENDURED SHOULD CALL

03:31:48.062 --> 03:31:50.664
ALL OF US TO ACTION. SO TODAY,

03:31:50.731 --> 03:31:52.299
LET'S STAND TOGETHER TO

03:31:52.366 --> 03:31:53.133
RECOGNIZE THE PROFOUND IMPACT

03:31:53.200 --> 03:31:55.302
OF THE MILITARY SEXUAL TRAUMA

03:31:55.369 --> 03:31:57.237
AND TO PLEDGE THAT WE WILL DO

03:31:57.304 --> 03:31:58.739
EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO

03:31:58.806 --> 03:32:00.207
ENSURE THAT SURVIVORS ARE

03:32:00.274 --> 03:32:02.009
SUPPORTED, AND THAT FUTURE

03:32:02.076 --> 03:32:04.278
SERVICE MEMBERS ARE SAFEGUARDED

03:32:04.344 --> 03:32:07.014
FROM THIS PAIN. WITH THAT, I DO

03:32:07.081 --> 03:32:10.551
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR EVERYONE'S

03:32:10.617 --> 03:32:13.854
SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

03:32:17.224 --> 03:32:19.226
THANK YOU, MADAM SPEAKER. THANK

03:32:19.293 --> 03:32:21.128
YOU TO MY COLLEAGUE FOR

03:32:21.195 --> 03:32:22.463
BRINGING THIS VERY IMPORTANT

03:32:22.529 --> 03:32:25.466
TOPIC. AS A SURVIVOR OF

03:32:25.532 --> 03:32:28.302
MILITARY SEXUAL TRAUMA, IT IS

03:32:28.368 --> 03:32:32.906
NOT ONLY JUST WOMEN, IT'S MEN.

03:32:32.973 --> 03:32:33.040
IT

03:32:33.107 --> 03:32:35.175
IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. IN MY

03:32:35.242 --> 03:32:39.146
TWO DECADES IN THE MARINE CORPS,

03:32:39.213 --> 03:32:42.049
I SAW IT ON EVERY CORNER ALL

03:32:42.116 --> 03:32:44.551
THE TIME, AND IT WAS LIKE A

03:32:44.618 --> 03:32:47.154
PLAGUE. IT WAS IN EVERY SERVICE.

03:32:47.221 --> 03:32:50.257
AND IT WAS UNFORTUNATE.

03:32:50.324 --> 03:32:52.092
ACCORDING TO A STUDY BY THE VA,

03:32:52.159 --> 03:32:54.228
4% OF MALE VETERANS EXPERIENCED

03:32:54.294 --> 03:32:57.164
MILITARY SEXUAL TRAUMA AND 41%

03:32:57.231 --> 03:32:59.933
OF FEMALE VETERANS EXPERIENCED

03:33:00.000 --> 03:33:02.102
MILITARY SEXUAL TRAUMA. WHETHER

03:33:02.169 --> 03:33:06.306
IT'S 4% OR 41%, IT'S ONE TOO

03:33:06.373 --> 03:33:08.442
MANY. THE SAME STUDY FOUND THAT

03:33:08.509 --> 03:33:13.313
COMBAT EXPOSED MEN WERE 1.57

03:33:13.380 --> 03:33:15.082
TIMES MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE

03:33:15.149 --> 03:33:17.017
MILITARY SEXUAL TRAUMA THAN

03:33:17.084 --> 03:33:18.752
THEIR NON-COMBAT EXPOSED

03:33:18.819 --> 03:33:21.955
COUNTERPARTS. 3.9% OF MALE

03:33:22.022 --> 03:33:24.758
VETERANS EXPERIENCE SEXUAL

03:33:24.825 --> 03:33:26.393
HARASSMENT, 41% OF FEMALE

03:33:26.460 --> 03:33:28.695
VETERANS EXPERIENCED SEXUAL

03:33:28.762 --> 03:33:30.797
HARASSMENT. COMBAT EXPOSED

03:33:30.864 --> 03:33:31.932
WOMEN WERE 1.42 TIMES MORE

03:33:31.999 --> 03:33:34.168
LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE MILITARY

03:33:34.234 --> 03:33:35.402
SEXUAL TRAUMA THAN THEIR

03:33:35.469 --> 03:33:37.404
NON-COMBAT EXPOSED COUNTERPARTS.

03:33:37.471 --> 03:33:39.373
WHILE EXACT NUMBERS ARE UNKNOWN,

03:33:39.439 --> 03:33:43.510
ONE STUDY SHOWS THAT 15.7% OF

03:33:43.577 --> 03:33:45.012
MILITARY PERSONNEL AND VETERANS

03:33:45.078 --> 03:33:48.248
REPORT MILITARY SEXUAL TRAUMA.

03:33:48.315 --> 03:33:50.384
STUDIES SHOW THAT MILITARY

03:33:50.450 --> 03:33:52.486
SEXUAL TRAUMA SIGNIFICANTLY

03:33:52.553 --> 03:33:54.688
HEIGHTENS THE SEVERITY AND RISK

03:33:54.755 --> 03:33:58.525
OF PTSD. SOME MIGHT SAY, WHY

03:33:58.592 --> 03:34:02.229
DID I START WITH MY OWN STORY?

03:34:02.296 --> 03:34:05.299
AND I BELIEVE THAT FOR ALL OF

03:34:05.365 --> 03:34:07.734
US, IN ALL THE TRAUMA THAT WE

03:34:07.801 --> 03:34:09.269
HAVE, WHETHER IT'S MILITARY,

03:34:09.336 --> 03:34:10.437
SEXUAL TRAUMA OR ANY TRAUMA

03:34:10.504 --> 03:34:13.473
ACROSS THE BOARD, THE WAY WE

03:34:13.540 --> 03:34:16.910
LOSE, THE WAY WE WE LOSE ITS

03:34:16.977 --> 03:34:20.047
GRIP ON US IS THROUGH OPEN

03:34:20.113 --> 03:34:23.083
COMMUNICATION. THE WAY WE TALK

03:34:23.150 --> 03:34:26.086
ABOUT IT IS THE WAY WE REMOVE

03:34:26.153 --> 03:34:28.255
THE STIGMAS THAT ARE OUT THERE.

03:34:28.322 --> 03:34:31.658
SO I FEEL NO SHAME, I FEEL

03:34:31.725 --> 03:34:33.227
STRENGTH, I FEEL STRENGTH THAT

03:34:33.293 --> 03:34:36.396
I CAN USE MY VOICE TO SHARE MY

03:34:36.463 --> 03:34:38.232
EXPERIENCES, TO SAY WHETHER

03:34:38.298 --> 03:34:39.099
YOU'VE HAD IT OR SOMEONE YOU

03:34:39.166 --> 03:34:41.235
KNOW HAS HAD IT, THEY NEED TO

03:34:41.301 --> 03:34:43.370
TALK ABOUT IT. NUMBER ONE. AND

03:34:43.437 --> 03:34:45.606
NUMBER TWO, WE NEED TO GATHER

03:34:45.672 --> 03:34:47.474
AROUND THOSE WHO EXPERIENCE

03:34:47.541 --> 03:34:49.009
MILITARY SEXUAL TRAUMA OR ANY

03:34:49.076 --> 03:34:50.711
OF THOSE TYPE OF TRAUMAS AND

03:34:50.777 --> 03:34:52.312
REINFORCE AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO

03:34:52.379 --> 03:34:55.782
FEEL SAFE, AND WE NEED TO

03:34:55.849 --> 03:34:57.084
PROTECT THEM. SO WITH THAT, I

03:34:57.150 --> 03:34:59.086
AM PROUD TO STAND WITH MY

03:34:59.152 --> 03:35:03.056

AROUND THIS ISSUE AND

THE CALIFORNIA VETERANS WHO

WERE SURVEYED NOTED THAT MORE

03:36:13.460 --> 03:36:15.195
THAN HALF OF THOSE SURVEYED

EXPERIENCED SEXUAL ASSAULT

03:36:17.264 --> 03:36:19.099
DURING THEIR SERVICE. THE

03:36:19.166 --> 03:36:21.201
MAJORITY OF VETERANS WHO

03:36:21.268 --> 03:36:22.803

HEALTH EFFECTS CAUSED BY MST,

03:36:48.395 --> 03:36:49.830
OF BEHAVIORAL MENTAL HEALTH

03:36:49.896 --> 03:36:53.834
ISSUES. NEARLY 70% REPORTING

03:36:56.670 --> 03:36:58.305
SEEK TREATMENT BECAUSE THEY

THEY FEARED RETALIATION OR WERE

03:37:02.776 --> 03:37:04.344
THREATENED AGAINST REPORTING.

03:37:04.411 --> 03:37:06.947
MANY RESPONDENTS WHO REPORTED

03:37:07.013 --> 03:37:09.049

03:37:15.188 --> 03:37:19.192

03:37:19.259 --> 03:37:22.763
71% EXPERIENCED RETALIATION

03:37:22.829 --> 03:37:24.898
AFTER REPORTING. THERE'S A LOT

03:37:24.965 --> 03:37:27.200
OF TROUBLING STATISTICS ON THIS

03:37:27.267 --> 03:37:29.336
ISSUE. THERE ARE MORE, BUT WE

03:37:29.403 --> 03:37:32.105
ALSO HEAR THE STORIES OF WHAT

03:37:32.172 --> 03:37:35.008

HEALTH CARE WHO DID NOT FEEL

03:37:38.478 --> 03:37:40.046
SAFE GOING TO A DOCTOR OR

03:37:40.113 --> 03:37:42.516
WAITING IN A WAITING ROOM,

03:37:42.582 --> 03:37:44.451
SURROUNDED BY MEN LOOKING LIKE

03:37:44.518 --> 03:37:47.187
THE ONE WHO HAD ASSAULTED HER.

03:37:47.254 --> 03:37:49.022
AND THERE'S A PROGRAM,

03:37:49.089 --> 03:37:51.958
FORTUNATELY, WHERE WOMEN WILL

03:37:52.025 --> 03:37:54.094
ESCORT WOMEN VETERANS SO THAT

03:37:54.161 --> 03:37:56.196
THEY CAN GET THE CARE THEY NEED.

03:37:56.263 --> 03:37:57.063
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT PROGRAM IS

03:37:57.130 --> 03:37:59.433
NOW THREATENED WITH CUTS

03:37:59.499 --> 03:38:02.002
BECAUSE OF FEDERAL CUTS. WITH

03:38:02.068 --> 03:38:04.204
THIS RESOLUTION, WE COMMIT TO

03:38:04.271 --> 03:38:05.372
DISMANTLING THE STIGMA

03:38:05.439 --> 03:38:07.541
ASSOCIATED WITH MILITARY SEXUAL

03:38:07.607 --> 03:38:09.643
TRAUMA, AND WE REAFFIRM THAT

03:38:09.709 --> 03:38:12.412
CALIFORNIA'S PLEDGE TO ENHANCE

03:38:12.479 --> 03:38:15.015

AND ACTION, TO STOP THOSE

03:38:24.124 --> 03:38:25.325
DEVASTATING EXPERIENCES THAT

03:38:25.392 --> 03:38:28.261
SHOULD NEVER, EVER BE A PART OF

03:38:28.328 --> 03:38:31.598
THE SACRIFICE TO SERVE. I LOOK

03:38:31.665 --> 03:38:32.532

03:46:23.069 --> 03:46:25.171
THAT SCHOOLS ARE ON THE FRONT

03:46:25.238 --> 03:46:26.539
LINES OF ADDRESSING CHALLENGES

03:46:26.606 --> 03:46:30.109

03:50:29.282 --> 03:50:31.584

MADAM SPEAKER. AND MEMBERS, I

RISE TODAY TO HONOR TRANSGENDER

03:50:37.223 --> 03:50:39.492
HISTORY MONTH, A CELEBRATION

03:50:39.559 --> 03:50:40.760
THAT SAN FRANCISCO PROUDLY

03:50:40.826 --> 03:50:44.297
BEGAN IN 2021. AND THIS BODY

03:50:44.363 --> 03:50:48.301
RECOGNIZED BEGINNING IN 2023

03:50:48.367 --> 03:50:50.069
FOR THE MONTH OF AUGUST. THIS

03:50:50.136 --> 03:50:52.138
MONTH IS A POWERFUL REMINDER

03:50:52.205 --> 03:50:52.972
THAT TRANSGENDER PEOPLE

03:50:53.039 --> 03:50:54.006
CONTINUE TO FACE

03:50:54.073 --> 03:50:55.575
DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH RATES

03:50:55.641 --> 03:50:58.044
OF VIOLENCE, HOMELESSNESS, AND

03:50:58.110 --> 03:50:59.779
MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES. THESE

03:50:59.845 --> 03:51:01.714
REALITIES DO NOT DEFINE THE

03:51:01.781 --> 03:51:03.816
COMMUNITY. TRANS HISTORY IS A

03:51:03.883 --> 03:51:05.785
STORY OF RESILIENCE, BRILLIANCE

03:51:05.851 --> 03:51:08.120
AND LEADERSHIP. TRANS PEOPLE

03:51:08.187 --> 03:51:09.388
HAVE BEEN A PART OF CALIFORNIA

03:51:09.455 --> 03:51:12.024
SINCE ITS EARLIEST DAYS. IN

03:51:12.091 --> 03:51:13.926
1775, SPANISH SOLDIER PEDRO

03:51:13.993 --> 03:51:17.663
FAGES DOCUMENTED THE RESPECTIVE

03:51:17.730 --> 03:51:19.865
INDIGENOUS CALIFORNIANS WHO

03:51:19.932 --> 03:51:21.200
EMBRACED GENDER VARIANCE DURING

03:51:21.267 --> 03:51:23.636
THE GOLD RUSH. FIGURES LIKE

03:51:23.703 --> 03:51:25.071
CHARLEY PARKHURST, A FAMED

03:51:25.137 --> 03:51:26.772
STAGECOACH DRIVER, LIVED

03:51:26.839 --> 03:51:28.341
AUTHENTICALLY IN A TIME WHEN

03:51:28.407 --> 03:51:30.543
FEW COULD. BY THE 19TH CENTURY,

03:51:30.610 --> 03:51:32.211
SAN FRANCISCO'S TENDERLOIN WAS

03:51:32.278 --> 03:51:33.045
ALREADY HOME TO GENDER

03:51:33.112 --> 03:51:35.581
EXPANSIVE PEOPLE LIKE JENNY Þ,

03:51:35.648 --> 03:51:37.250
WHO CORRESPONDED WITH EARLY

03:51:37.316 --> 03:51:39.018
SEXOLOGISTS AND LEFT BEHIND A

03:51:39.085 --> 03:51:40.319
HISTORIC RECORD OF TRANSGENDER

03:51:40.386 --> 03:51:42.922
LIFE. WE OBSERVE THIS MONTH IN

03:51:42.989 --> 03:51:44.257
AUGUST BECAUSE IT MARKS A

03:51:44.323 --> 03:51:46.225
TURNING POINT IN HISTORY.

03:51:46.292 --> 03:51:48.094
COMPTON'S CAFETERIA RIOT OF

03:51:48.160 --> 03:51:50.963
1966, WHEN A TRANS WOMAN IN SAN

03:51:51.030 --> 03:51:52.164
FRANCISCO'S TENDERLOIN DISTRICT

03:51:52.231 --> 03:51:54.500
RESISTED POLICE HARASSMENT AND

03:51:54.567 --> 03:51:57.069
SPARKED A REVOLT. AS HISTORIAN

03:51:57.136 --> 03:51:58.404
DOCTOR STRYKER HAS REMINDED US,

03:51:58.471 --> 03:52:00.339
THIS WAS THE FIRST ACT OF

03:52:00.406 --> 03:52:02.074
MILITANT QUEER RESISTANCE TO

03:52:02.141 --> 03:52:03.409
POLICE HARASSMENT IN THE UNITED

03:52:03.476 --> 03:52:05.444
STATES. THREE YEARS BEFORE

03:52:05.511 --> 03:52:08.281
STONEWALL, SAN FRANCISCO AND

03:52:08.347 --> 03:52:11.484
CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN Ã AT THE

03:52:11.550 --> 03:52:12.184
HEART OF TRANSITIONING

03:52:12.251 --> 03:52:14.353
TRANSGENDER HISTORY AND THE

03:52:14.420 --> 03:52:17.556
TRANSGENDER MOVEMENT IN OUR

03:52:17.623 --> 03:52:18.391
COUNTRY. THIS MONTH IS A

03:52:18.457 --> 03:52:20.459
REMINDER THAT CALIFORNIA'S

03:52:20.526 --> 03:52:21.360
STORY IS INSEPARABLE FROM THE

03:52:21.427 --> 03:52:23.396
STRUGGLE FOR TRANS JUSTICE AND

03:52:23.462 --> 03:52:25.231
RECOGNITION IN AMERICA. BUT IT

03:52:25.298 --> 03:52:27.433
IS ALSO A CALL TO ACTION

03:52:27.500 --> 03:52:29.435
BECAUSE TRANS RIGHTS ARE UNDER

03:52:29.502 --> 03:52:30.903
ATTACK IN THIS COUNTRY AT THIS

03:52:30.970 --> 03:52:32.271
VERY MOMENT, WE SEE EFFORTS TO

03:52:32.338 --> 03:52:34.106
ERASE TRANS PEOPLE FROM THE

03:52:34.173 --> 03:52:35.074
MILITARY, FROM PUBLIC LIFE,

03:52:35.141 --> 03:52:37.176
FROM CLASSROOMS AND HEALTHCARE

03:52:37.243 --> 03:52:40.246
SYSTEMS. THESE ARE NOT ABSTRACT

03:52:40.313 --> 03:52:41.113
POLICIES. THEY ARE DIRECT

03:52:41.180 --> 03:52:43.282
ATTACKS ON THE DIGNITY, SAFETY

03:52:43.349 --> 03:52:45.251
AND FUTURES OF OUR NEIGHBORS.

03:52:45.318 --> 03:52:47.186
SO TODAY WE SAY CLEARLY THAT

03:52:47.253 --> 03:52:49.121
THIS IS NOT A TIME TO BE FAIR

03:52:49.188 --> 03:52:51.090
WEATHER FRIENDS, WHEN THE

03:52:51.157 --> 03:52:52.391
STORMS OF HATE AND FEAR ARE

03:52:52.458 --> 03:52:54.593
RAGING. THIS IS PRECISELY WHEN

03:52:54.660 --> 03:52:56.529
THE TRANS COMMUNITY NEEDS US

03:52:56.595 --> 03:52:58.397
THE MOST. WE STAND WITH THE

03:52:58.464 --> 03:53:00.099
TRANS COMMUNITY BECAUSE THE

03:53:00.166 --> 03:53:01.734
TRANS COMMUNITY HAS BEEN A PART

03:53:01.801 --> 03:53:03.235
OF OUR STATE AND HAS

03:53:03.302 --> 03:53:05.471
CONTRIBUTED AT EVERY LEVEL IN

03:53:05.538 --> 03:53:07.239
BUSINESS, IN POLITICS, IN

03:53:07.306 --> 03:53:10.242
ACADEMIA. AND THEIR STORY IS

03:53:10.309 --> 03:53:13.579
CALIFORNIA'S STORY. AND AS

03:53:13.646 --> 03:53:15.147
THEIR EXISTENCE, THEIR VERY

03:53:15.214 --> 03:53:17.049
EXISTENCE IS UNDER ATTACK. WE

03:53:17.116 --> 03:53:19.218
LOOK AT OUR OWN STORY IN

03:53:19.285 --> 03:53:21.587
CALIFORNIA AND THE WAY THAT

03:53:21.654 --> 03:53:22.188
THEY HAVE HELPED TO CONTRIBUTE

03:53:22.254 --> 03:53:24.623
AND BUILD OUR STATE. EVERY

03:53:24.690 --> 03:53:26.092
SINGLE RESIDENT IN OUR STATE

03:53:26.158 --> 03:53:29.161
DESERVES TO LIVE AS THEMSELVES,

03:53:29.228 --> 03:53:33.199
FREELY, IN PUBLIC, SAFELY. AND

03:53:33.265 --> 03:53:35.401
TODAY, AND THIS MONTH, WE

03:53:35.468 --> 03:53:37.169
RECOGNIZE AND HONOR TRANSGENDER

03:53:37.236 --> 03:53:38.971
HISTORY AND COMMIT OURSELVES TO

03:53:39.038 --> 03:53:40.206
BUILDING A FUTURE WHERE TRANS

03:53:40.272 --> 03:53:42.241
PEOPLE CAN LIVE SAFELY, OPENLY,

03:53:42.308 --> 03:53:44.710
AND WITH PRIDE. WITH THAT, I

03:53:44.777 --> 03:53:46.045
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE

03:53:46.112 --> 03:53:49.181

THE TRANS COMMUNITY INCREASE

03:54:12.271 --> 03:54:14.340
ACROSS OUR NATION, FUELED BY

03:54:14.407 --> 03:54:16.609

FIGHT FOR DIGNITY, EQUALITY AND

03:56:21.166 --> 03:56:23.302
FREEDOM. IT IS BECAUSE OF THEIR

03:56:23.369 --> 03:56:25.304
COURAGE THAT PEOPLE LIKE ME CAN

03:56:25.371 --> 03:56:26.105
STAND HERE TODAY WITH

03:56:26.171 --> 03:56:28.541
PROTECTIONS UNDER THE LAW. YET

03:56:28.607 --> 03:56:29.041
TODAY WE ARE WITNESSING

03:56:29.108 --> 03:56:30.142
RELENTLESS ATTACKS FROM A

03:56:30.209 --> 03:56:31.477
FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION INTENT

03:56:31.544 --> 03:56:33.245
ON UNDERMINING THE LIVELIHOOD,

03:56:33.312 --> 03:56:36.115
SAFETY AND HUMANITY OF

03:56:36.181 --> 03:56:37.383
TRANSGENDER PEOPLE. WE MUST

03:56:37.449 --> 03:56:38.984
STAND IN UNWAVERING SOLIDARITY

03:56:39.051 --> 03:56:41.120
TO COMBAT ERASURE, TO CONFRONT

03:56:41.186 --> 03:56:43.289
DISCRIMINATION, TO STOP THE

03:56:43.355 --> 03:56:45.090
DANGEROUS RISE OF HATEFUL

03:56:45.157 --> 03:56:48.394
RHETORIC AND VIOLENCE. HISTORY

03:56:48.460 --> 03:56:49.295
REMINDS US THAT OUR COMMUNITY

03:56:49.361 --> 03:56:51.564
HAS ALWAYS EXISTED RESILIENT,

03:56:51.630 --> 03:56:54.567
DEFIANT AND LEADING. LONG

03:56:54.633 --> 03:56:55.167
BEFORE STONEWALL, TRANSGENDER

03:56:55.234 --> 03:56:56.435
WOMEN AND DRAG QUEENS OF COLOR

03:56:56.502 --> 03:56:58.170
WERE ALREADY RISING UP AT THE

03:56:58.237 --> 03:56:59.405
COMPTON'S CAFETERIA RIOTS IN

03:56:59.471 --> 03:57:01.006
SAN FRANCISCO, DEMANDING TO BE

03:57:01.073 --> 03:57:03.709
SEEN AND TREATED WITH DIGNITY.

03:57:03.776 --> 03:57:05.477
BUT FOR TOO LONG, THEIR

03:57:05.544 --> 03:57:06.345
CONTRIBUTIONS HAVE BEEN

03:57:06.412 --> 03:57:07.279
DELIBERATELY ERASED, THEIR

03:57:07.346 --> 03:57:09.615
STORIES EXCLUDED, THEIR

03:57:09.682 --> 03:57:11.116
LEADERSHIP IGNORED. TODAY, THE

03:57:11.183 --> 03:57:13.752
ERASURE CONTINUES AS SOME SEEK

03:57:13.819 --> 03:57:15.020
TO RIP TRANSGENDER NARRATIVES

03:57:15.087 --> 03:57:17.189
OUT OF OUR HISTORY BOOKS,

03:57:17.256 --> 03:57:18.457
SILENCE THEM IN OUR CLASSROOMS

03:57:18.524 --> 03:57:20.459
AND DENY THEM FROM OUR PUBLIC

03:57:20.526 --> 03:57:22.828
DISCOURSE. THESE EFFORTS DO NOT

03:57:22.895 --> 03:57:24.997
DISTORT OUR HISTORY. THEY

03:57:25.064 --> 03:57:26.398
ENDANGER LIVES. THEY STRIP AWAY

03:57:26.465 --> 03:57:28.367
VISIBILITY. THEY DENY FUTURE

03:57:28.434 --> 03:57:30.069
GENERATIONS THE TRUTH OF WHO WE

03:57:30.135 --> 03:57:32.037
ARE AND WHO WE COME FROM. THAT

03:57:32.104 --> 03:57:34.139
IS WHY THIS RESOLUTION MATTERS.

03:57:34.206 --> 03:57:35.407
BY DESIGNATING AUGUST AS

03:57:35.474 --> 03:57:37.109
TRANSGENDER HISTORY MONTH, WE

03:57:37.176 --> 03:57:38.444
AFFIRM THAT TRANSGENDER HISTORY

03:57:38.510 --> 03:57:40.346
IS AMERICAN HISTORY. WE HONOR

03:57:40.412 --> 03:57:43.148
THE LEADERS WHO PAVED THE WAY.

03:57:43.215 --> 03:57:44.316
WE PROTECT THE TRUTH TO OF OUR

03:57:44.383 --> 03:57:46.619
PAST, AND WE GIVE STRENGTH TO

03:57:46.685 --> 03:57:49.288
THOSE FIGHTING FOR THEIR FUTURE.

03:57:49.355 --> 03:57:50.623
AND AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF LOS

03:57:50.689 --> 03:57:52.224
ANGELES, I'M ESPECIALLY PROUD

03:57:52.291 --> 03:57:54.360
THAT MY CITY IS HOME TO TRANS

03:57:54.426 --> 03:57:56.095
LATIN COALITION, A POWERFUL,

03:57:56.161 --> 03:57:57.896
TRAILBLAZING ORGANIZATION LED

03:57:57.963 --> 03:57:59.999
BY AND FOR TRANSGENDER AND

GENDER NONCONFORMING IMMIGRANTS

03:58:01.834 --> 03:58:03.469

UPLIFT VOICES, AND LEAD WITH

03:58:05.671 --> 03:58:08.307
COURAGE EVERY SINGLE DAY. I

03:58:08.374 --> 03:58:10.175
THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN

03:58:10.242 --> 03:58:11.977
FRANCISCO FOR HIS ALLYSHIP, AND

03:58:12.044 --> 03:58:13.379
I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING

03:58:13.445 --> 03:58:15.314
HIS WORK ALONGSIDE THE LGBTQ+

03:58:15.381 --> 03:58:17.049
CAUCUS AND OUR ALLIES AND OUR

03:58:17.116 --> 03:58:18.283
COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO UPLIFT

03:58:18.350 --> 03:58:20.719

03:58:20.786 --> 03:58:22.821
COLLEAGUES, I ASK YOU TO JOIN

03:58:22.888 --> 03:58:24.223

03:58:24.289 --> 03:58:26.058
PRESERVING IT, AND CELEBRATING

03:58:26.125 --> 03:58:28.594
IT WITH THE RESPECT THAT IT

03:58:28.661 --> 03:58:29.628
DESERVES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK

03:58:29.695 --> 03:58:33.332
FOR YOUR VOTE ON H.R. 47. THANK

03:58:33.399 --> 03:58:34.933
YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. ASSEMBLY

03:58:36.802 --> 03:58:39.004
RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MADAM

03:58:39.071 --> 03:58:42.207
SPEAKER. TRANSGENDER TWO SPIRIT,

03:58:42.274 --> 03:58:43.409
GENDER EXPANSIVE AND INTERSEX

03:58:43.475 --> 03:58:45.144
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN A PART OF

03:58:45.210 --> 03:58:46.245
CALIFORNIA'S STORIES FOR

03:58:46.311 --> 03:58:47.780
CENTURIES, FROM INDIGENOUS

03:58:47.846 --> 03:58:49.114
CULTURES TO THE GOLD RUSH TO

03:58:49.181 --> 03:58:51.316
THE ONGOING FIGHT FOR RIGHTS

03:58:51.383 --> 03:58:52.117
AND RECOGNITION. IN A TIME

03:58:52.184 --> 03:58:54.386
WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS

03:58:54.453 --> 03:58:56.255
SEEKING TO REVERSE PROGRESS.

03:58:56.321 --> 03:58:57.489
JUST AS WE RECOGNIZE AND TEACH

03:58:57.556 --> 03:58:59.091
ABOUT OTHER IMPORTANT GROUPS IN

03:58:59.158 --> 03:59:01.627
OUR STATE, THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF

03:59:01.694 --> 03:59:02.294
TRANSGENDER AND GENDER

03:59:02.361 --> 03:59:03.128
EXPANSIVE CONSTITUENTS TO

03:59:03.195 --> 03:59:06.198
CALIFORNIA ALSO DESERVES TO BE

03:59:06.265 --> 03:59:07.332
RECOGNIZED. CALIFORNIA HAS LONG

03:59:07.399 --> 03:59:09.368
LED THE NATION IN ADVANCING

03:59:09.435 --> 03:59:10.903
CIVIL RIGHTS, AND WE CONTINUE

03:59:10.969 --> 03:59:12.237
TO DO SO WHERE THE GOVERNMENT

03:59:12.304 --> 03:59:14.139
IS TAKING ACTIONS SUCH AS NOT

03:59:14.206 --> 03:59:16.475
ALLOWING THEM TO TRAVEL WITH

03:59:16.542 --> 03:59:17.209
WITH PASSPORTS THAT REFLECT

03:59:17.276 --> 03:59:19.344
THEIR GENDER IDENTITY,

03:59:19.411 --> 03:59:20.212
RECOGNIZING TRANSGENDER HISTORY

03:59:20.279 --> 03:59:22.347
MONTH CONTINUES THAT LEADERSHIP

03:59:22.414 --> 03:59:24.183
AND SIGNALS THAT CALIFORNIA

03:59:24.249 --> 03:59:26.118
VALUES DIGNITY, EQUALITY AND

03:59:26.185 --> 03:59:29.254
SAFETY FOR EVERYONE. UNLIKE

03:59:29.321 --> 03:59:31.090
WHAT THE OPPOSITION MAY SAY,

03:59:31.156 --> 03:59:32.558
INCREASED VISIBILITY DOES NOT

03:59:32.624 --> 03:59:35.260
MEAN INCREASED EXISTENCE. TRANS

03:59:35.327 --> 03:59:37.996
PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HERE,

03:59:38.063 --> 03:59:39.398
BUT WHAT'S CHANGED IS THE

03:59:39.465 --> 03:59:42.234
SAFETY TO COME FORWARD. SORRY,

03:59:42.301 --> 03:59:45.370
I DO NOT WANT TO SEE ANYONE

03:59:45.437 --> 03:59:48.440
GOING BACK TO LIVING IN FEAR.

03:59:48.507 --> 03:59:49.241
RESEARCH CONSISTENTLY SHOWS

03:59:49.308 --> 03:59:51.477
THAT AFFIRMING A YOUNG PERSON'S

03:59:51.543 --> 03:59:53.078
IDENTITY IMPROVES MENTAL HEALTH

03:59:53.145 --> 03:59:55.848
OUTCOMES AND REDUCES DEPRESSION,

03:59:55.914 --> 03:59:57.616
SELF-HARM, AND SUICIDE. DENYING

03:59:57.683 --> 03:59:59.551
THEIR IDENTITIES INCREASE RISK

03:59:59.618 --> 04:00:02.521
AND HARM. NEVERTHELESS, THIS

04:00:02.588 --> 04:00:04.590
RESOLUTION DOES NOT PRESCRIBE

04:00:04.656 --> 04:00:06.058
MEDICAL MEDICAL CARE. IT

04:00:06.125 --> 04:00:08.293
ACKNOWLEDGES HISTORY TO CLAIM

04:00:08.360 --> 04:00:10.763
OTHERWISE, CONFUSES THE ISSUE,

04:00:10.829 --> 04:00:12.264
AND SPREADS MISINFORMATION. SO

04:00:12.331 --> 04:00:13.465
THIS RESOLUTION IS ABOUT

04:00:13.532 --> 04:00:15.033
HONORING CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE

04:00:15.100 --> 04:00:17.836
CONTRIBUTED TO OUR CULTURE,

04:00:17.903 --> 04:00:18.403
RESISTED DISCRIMINATION, AND

04:00:18.470 --> 04:00:21.373
HAVE MADE HISTORY. TRANS PEOPLE

04:00:21.440 --> 04:00:24.009
EXIST, THEY'VE ALWAYS EXISTED,

04:00:24.076 --> 04:00:25.677
AND THEY HAVE BEEN A PART OF

04:00:25.744 --> 04:00:27.346
OUR STATE'S HISTORY AND WILL

04:00:27.412 --> 04:00:29.014
CONTINUE TO BE A PART OF OUR

04:00:29.081 --> 04:00:30.883
STATE'S HISTORY. AND I'D LIKE

04:00:30.949 --> 04:00:31.517
TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN

04:00:31.583 --> 04:00:32.851

04:00:32.918 --> 04:00:35.254
THIS, THIS AIR ON THE

04:00:35.320 --> 04:00:37.689
RESOLUTION. AND I TRULY,

04:00:37.756 --> 04:00:38.757
RESPECTFULLY URGE THAT I VOTE

04:00:38.824 --> 04:00:43.095
FOR H.R. 57. THANK YOU.

04:00:43.162 --> 04:00:44.696
ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE, YOU'RE

04:00:44.763 --> 04:00:45.964
RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MADAM

04:00:46.031 --> 04:00:48.500
SPEAKER. FIRST, I WANT TO THANK

04:00:48.567 --> 04:00:49.067
MY COLLEAGUE, OUR COLLEAGUE

04:00:49.134 --> 04:00:50.502
FROM SAN FRANCISCO, FOR HIS

04:00:50.569 --> 04:00:52.104
STEADFAST ALLYSHIP TO THE LGBT

04:00:52.171 --> 04:00:53.272
COMMUNITY AND ESPECIALLY THE

04:00:53.338 --> 04:00:54.373
TRANS COMMUNITY. SO MUCH HAS

04:00:54.439 --> 04:00:55.274
BEEN SAID ALREADY FROM OUR

04:00:55.340 --> 04:00:56.275
COLLEAGUES ABOUT HOW TRANS

04:00:56.341 --> 04:00:58.343
FOLKS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ON THE

04:00:58.410 --> 04:00:59.444
FRONT LINES OF FIGHTING FOR

04:00:59.511 --> 04:01:00.145
COLLECTIVE LIBERATION FOR ALL

04:01:00.212 --> 04:01:03.582
LGBT PEOPLE, BUT ALL PEOPLE

04:01:03.649 --> 04:01:04.183
COLLECTIVELY. I TRULY BELIEVE

04:01:04.249 --> 04:01:06.385
THAT WHEN WE FIGHT FOR TRANS

04:01:06.451 --> 04:01:08.787
RIGHTS IN ANY ARENA, BE IT LIFE

04:01:08.854 --> 04:01:10.055
SAVING, HEALTHCARE OR

04:01:10.122 --> 04:01:11.190
OPPORTUNITIES IN EDUCATION, WE

04:01:11.256 --> 04:01:12.925
ARE FIGHTING FOR MORE

04:01:12.991 --> 04:01:14.159
OPPORTUNITIES AND ACCESS AND

04:01:14.226 --> 04:01:15.494
LIFE SAVING TREATMENT FOR ALL

04:01:15.561 --> 04:01:17.396
PEOPLE, NOT JUST QUEER PEOPLE.

04:01:17.462 --> 04:01:19.097
SO I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL

04:01:19.164 --> 04:01:20.232
THAT'S BEEN SAID IN RALLYING

04:01:20.299 --> 04:01:21.567
SUPPORT FOR TRANS COMMUNITY,

04:01:21.633 --> 04:01:22.301
BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY, TOO

04:01:22.367 --> 04:01:24.536
OFTEN, EVEN IN CALIFORNIA,

04:01:24.603 --> 04:01:26.004
ESPECIALLY IN THE NATION, TRANS

04:01:26.071 --> 04:01:27.239
PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BE THE

04:01:27.306 --> 04:01:29.474
SCAPEGOATS FOR SO MANY

04:01:29.541 --> 04:01:30.375
SOCIETY'S ILLS, WHICH IS

04:01:30.442 --> 04:01:32.044
ENTIRELY FALSE. IT IS HARMFUL

04:01:32.110 --> 04:01:33.478
TO SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE AND

04:01:33.545 --> 04:01:35.414
QUEER PEOPLE OUT THERE, AND I

04:01:35.480 --> 04:01:36.315

04:01:39.084 --> 04:01:40.485
FLOOR, AS WE ALL COLLEAGUES

04:01:40.552 --> 04:01:42.120

04:01:42.187 --> 04:01:43.455
RIGHTS TO SUPPORT ALL HUMAN

04:01:43.522 --> 04:01:45.123
RIGHTS. SO THANK YOU.

APPRECIATE IT. SEEING AND

THEIR PARTNERSHIP AND FOR THEIR

04:02:03.408 --> 04:02:05.177
LEADERSHIP. AS YOU HAVE HEARD,

04:02:05.244 --> 04:02:07.646
CALIFORNIA HAS A VERY PROUD

04:02:07.713 --> 04:02:10.716
HISTORY OF TRANSGENDER

04:02:10.782 --> 04:02:11.316
LEADERSHIP AND CONTRIBUTIONS.

04:02:11.383 --> 04:02:14.119
IT IS A HISTORY THAT ALL OF US

04:02:14.186 --> 04:02:15.387
HAVE BENEFITED FROM. THEY HAVE

04:02:15.454 --> 04:02:17.122
MADE OUR STATE BETTER, AND THE

04:02:17.189 --> 04:02:19.258
WAY THAT THEY HAVE FOUGHT FOR

04:02:19.324 --> 04:02:21.526
THEIR OWN RECOGNITION AND THEIR

04:02:21.593 --> 04:02:26.298
OWN RIGHTS HAS EXPANDED THE

04:02:26.365 --> 04:02:28.233
OPPORTUNITIES AND THE RIGHTS. I

04:02:28.300 --> 04:02:30.302
THINK THAT ALL OF US BENEFIT

04:02:30.369 --> 04:02:32.671

IN IN POLITICS TO PROVE WHO HE

04:10:40.992 --> 04:10:41.926

WHERE HE WAS KNOWN NOT JUST FOR

STUDENTS LOOKED UP TO, NOT JUST

04:11:14.325 --> 04:11:16.327
BECAUSE OF THE PLAYS HE CALLED,

04:11:16.394 --> 04:11:18.763
BUT BECAUSE OF THE VALUES HE

04:11:18.830 --> 04:11:21.366

THESE ROLES, STEVE SHOWED THAT

04:11:48.493 --> 04:11:49.227
LEADERSHIP DOES NOT COME FROM

04:11:49.294 --> 04:11:52.664
TITLES. IT COMES FROM SHOWING

04:12:42.347 --> 04:12:44.749
LISTENED MORE THAN WHAT HE

04:12:44.816 --> 04:12:48.419
