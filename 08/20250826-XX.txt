SUMMER BAUER-KAHAN. SOME DAYS

00:47:55.239 --> 00:47:57.140
IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE LIVING IN

00:47:57.207 --> 00:47:58.075
AN EPISODE OF STAR TREK,

00:47:58.141 --> 00:48:00.143

WORLD'S CIVILIZATIONS IN OUR

00:48:03.947 --> 00:48:05.215
COMMUNICATE WITH PEOPLE ON THE

OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD.

00:48:06.883 --> 00:48:08.051
MEDICAL ADVANCES REGULARLY

00:48:08.118 --> 00:48:10.687
TREAT DISEASES THAT ONLY A FEW

YEARS AGO WOULD HAVE BEEN

00:48:11.288 --> 00:48:12.055
CATASTROPHIC. EACH NEW

00:48:12.122 --> 00:48:14.124
GENERATION HAS BEEN FORCED TO

00:48:14.191 --> 00:48:15.192
GRAPPLE WITH THE RAPID PACE OF

00:48:15.259 --> 00:48:16.860
TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION, SO

00:48:16.927 --> 00:48:18.095
THAT OUR CHILDREN AND THEIR

00:48:18.161 --> 00:48:19.363
CHILDREN CAN ENJOY A BRIGHTER

00:48:19.429 --> 00:48:20.864
FUTURE. THE CALIFORNIA STATE

00:48:20.931 --> 00:48:23.433
UNIVERSITY IS TRULY ONE OF THE

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:24.334
CROWN JEWELS OF OUR STATE, AND

00:48:24.401 --> 00:48:25.936
A PLACE WHERE OUR STUDENTS GO

00:48:26.003 --> 00:48:27.771
TO DEVELOP SKILLS TO MEET THE

00:48:27.838 --> 00:48:29.606
MOMENT. UNIVERSITIES HAVE

00:48:29.673 --> 00:48:30.240
ALWAYS BEEN GREAT LABORATORIES

00:48:30.307 --> 00:48:32.175
OF OUR SOCIETY, THE PLACES

00:48:32.242 --> 00:48:33.510
WHERE WE GO TO BETTER

00:48:33.577 --> 00:48:34.544
UNDERSTAND OURSELVES AND OUR

00:48:34.611 --> 00:48:36.146
WORLD, THE PLACES WHERE WE

00:48:36.213 --> 00:48:38.448
INTERACT WITH NEW IDEAS AND NEW

00:48:38.515 --> 00:48:39.950
TECHNOLOGIES. ARTIFICIAL

00:48:40.017 --> 00:48:42.085
INTELLIGENCE IS ONE OF THOSE

00:48:42.152 --> 00:48:43.020
NEW TECHNOLOGIES. AS WE'VE SEEN

00:48:43.086 --> 00:48:45.055
IN JUST A SHORT TIME, AI HAS

00:48:45.122 --> 00:48:47.090
BECOME A POWERFUL TOOL THAT IS

00:48:47.157 --> 00:48:48.292
WIDELY USED ACROSS SECTORS. IN

00:48:48.358 --> 00:48:50.060
FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR, THE

00:48:50.127 --> 00:48:51.328
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ANNOUNCED

00:48:51.395 --> 00:48:52.296
THE DECISION TO BECOME THE

00:48:52.362 --> 00:48:54.331
NATION'S FIRST AND LARGEST AI

00:48:54.398 --> 00:48:56.133
EMPOWERED UNIVERSITY SYSTEM

00:48:56.199 --> 00:48:56.900
THROUGH A PARTNERSHIP WITH

00:48:56.967 --> 00:49:00.070
OPENAI. THE CSU HAS ROLLED OUT

00:49:00.137 --> 00:49:02.139
CHATGPT EDU AND AS I UNDERSTAND

00:49:02.205 --> 00:49:05.876
IT, OVER 40 OVER 93,000 CHATGPT

00:49:05.942 --> 00:49:07.010
EDU ACCOUNTS HAVE BEEN

00:49:07.077 --> 00:49:09.212
ACTIVATED SYSTEM WIDE. THAT IS

00:49:09.279 --> 00:49:10.847
MORE THAN TWICE THE NUMBER

00:49:10.914 --> 00:49:12.482
ORIGINALLY PROJECTED FOR THIS

00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:14.284
LAUNCH PERIOD. ONLY ONE ELEMENT

00:49:14.351 --> 00:49:16.153
OF A MUCH LARGER AI INTEGRATION

00:49:16.219 --> 00:49:17.321
THAT WOULD BE EXPLORING THIS

00:49:17.387 --> 00:49:20.490
AFTERNOON. I'M EAGER TO LEARN

00:49:20.557 --> 00:49:21.091
MORE ABOUT THIS INTEGRATION,

00:49:21.158 --> 00:49:23.060
AND TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE

00:49:23.126 --> 00:49:23.894
DEVELOPMENT OF THIS INITIATIVE,

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:25.195
AND ALSO THE ROLLOUT OF THIS

00:49:25.262 --> 00:49:27.397
INITIATIVE AND THE FUTURE SHORT

00:49:27.464 --> 00:49:28.198
TERM AND MID-TERM PLANNING. I

00:49:28.265 --> 00:49:29.900
ALSO WANT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND

00:49:29.966 --> 00:49:31.034
THE TRAINING THAT STUDENTS,

00:49:31.101 --> 00:49:32.336
FACULTY AND STAFF ARE RECEIVING

00:49:32.402 --> 00:49:34.204
TO BEST UTILIZE THESE NEW

00:49:34.271 --> 00:49:35.172
TECHNOLOGIES, ESPECIALLY

00:49:35.238 --> 00:49:36.707

CONFIDENTLY PROVIDE VERY

00:49:40.577 --> 00:49:41.078
INCORRECT INFORMATION TO OUR

00:49:41.144 --> 00:49:43.680
USERS. THERE ARE ALSO QUESTIONS

00:49:43.747 --> 00:49:44.915
OF ETHICAL USE AND HOW THIS

00:49:44.981 --> 00:49:46.717
TECHNOLOGY WILL IMPACT OUR

00:49:46.783 --> 00:49:47.317
HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS

00:49:47.384 --> 00:49:50.687

KNOW WORK VERY HARD. AND THIS

00:51:07.297 --> 00:51:08.398
IS SUPPOSED TO BE WHEN THINGS

00:51:08.465 --> 00:51:09.966
ARE A LITTLE QUIETER FOR THEM.

00:51:10.033 --> 00:51:11.234

00:51:20.577 --> 00:51:23.346
GATHERING OF LEADERSHIP,

STUDENTS, YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE

00:51:28.018 --> 00:51:29.152
ECOSYSTEM TO REALLY TALK ABOUT

00:51:29.219 --> 00:51:31.354
HOW THIS ROLLOUT IS HAPPENING

00:51:31.421 --> 00:51:32.122
AND HOW THEY'RE ENGAGING WITH

00:51:32.189 --> 00:51:34.658
THE TECHNOLOGY. OVER THE LAST

00:51:34.724 --> 00:51:35.959
TWO YEARS, OUR COMMITTEE, THE

00:51:36.026 --> 00:51:37.227
PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION

00:51:37.294 --> 00:51:39.095
COMMITTEE, HAS HELD OR

00:51:39.162 --> 00:51:41.965
PARTICIPATED IN HEARINGS ON AI,

00:51:42.032 --> 00:51:43.834
RANGING FROM ISSUES REGARDING

00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:45.202
THE ARTS, WORKFORCE, HEALTHCARE

00:51:45.268 --> 00:51:48.171
AND MORE. AND THE THING THAT WE

00:51:48.238 --> 00:51:49.105
HAVE THE COMMON THREAD

00:51:49.172 --> 00:51:50.106
THROUGHOUT ALL OF THESE

00:51:50.173 --> 00:51:52.008
HEARINGS IS A QUESTION OF HOW

00:51:52.075 --> 00:51:54.110
DO WE INTEGRATE AI TO HARNESS

00:51:54.177 --> 00:51:56.046
ITS POTENTIAL BUT MANAGE THE

00:51:56.112 --> 00:51:57.047
DISRUPTIONS? AND I THINK THAT

00:51:57.113 --> 00:51:58.982
IS REALLY THE FOUNDATION OF HOW

00:51:59.049 --> 00:52:01.051
WE HAVE TRIED TO APPROACH THIS,

00:52:01.117 --> 00:52:02.352
WHICH IS AI HAS SO MUCH

00:52:02.419 --> 00:52:04.321
POTENTIAL. IT IS SUCH AN

00:52:04.387 --> 00:52:05.455
EXCITING INNOVATION. CALIFORNIA

00:52:05.522 --> 00:52:07.858
IS LEADING THE WAY IN BEING THE

00:52:07.924 --> 00:52:10.126
HOME OF SO MUCH OF THAT

00:52:10.193 --> 00:52:11.561
INNOVATION. AND YET WE KNOW

00:52:11.628 --> 00:52:12.963
THAT WITH IT COMES RISK. AND SO

00:52:13.029 --> 00:52:15.398
WE HAVE TO SEE THAT INNOVATION

00:52:15.465 --> 00:52:17.000
THROUGH THE LENS OF HOW IT CAN

00:52:17.067 --> 00:52:18.268
HELP US WHILE PROTECTING

00:52:18.335 --> 00:52:20.871
OURSELVES FROM THE HARMS THAT

00:52:20.937 --> 00:52:23.840
CAN POTENTIALLY APPEAR FROM IT.

00:52:23.907 --> 00:52:25.308
EDUCATION IS ONE OF THE MOST

00:52:25.375 --> 00:52:27.410
CONSEQUENTIAL CONTEXTS FOR AI.

00:52:27.477 --> 00:52:28.144
ONE OF THE REASONS THAT

00:52:28.211 --> 00:52:31.648
CALIFORNIA LEADS THE WAY IN SO

00:52:31.715 --> 00:52:33.717
MANY WAYS THROUGH TECHNOLOGY IS

00:52:33.783 --> 00:52:34.217
OUR INCREDIBLE EDUCATION

00:52:34.284 --> 00:52:36.052
INSTITUTIONS. IT IS THE TALENT

00:52:36.119 --> 00:52:38.121
THAT THE CSUS, THE UCS AND OUR

00:52:38.188 --> 00:52:39.956
PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS CREATE AND

00:52:40.023 --> 00:52:42.092
PUT OUT INTO THE WORLD TO MAKE

00:52:42.158 --> 00:52:44.261
THE WORLD CHANGE THROUGH THINGS

00:52:44.327 --> 00:52:44.995
LIKE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.

00:52:45.061 --> 00:52:47.197
AND WE NEED TO MEET OUR

00:52:47.264 --> 00:52:48.465
STUDENTS IN THE MOMENT WE ARE

00:52:48.532 --> 00:52:50.133
IN, WHICH MEANS HELPING THEM TO

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:51.801
PREPARE FOR THE FUTURE THAT

00:52:51.868 --> 00:52:53.103
THEY ARE FACING, WHICH IS ONE

00:52:53.169 --> 00:52:56.439
THAT WILL BE VERY MUCH AI

00:52:56.506 --> 00:52:58.141
CENTRIC. AND SO I WANT TO THANK

00:52:58.208 --> 00:52:59.376
THE UNIVERSITY FOR REALLY

00:52:59.442 --> 00:53:03.580
LEANING IN TO THE MOMENT. AI

00:53:03.647 --> 00:53:05.282
LITERACY IS ESSENTIAL TO MAKING

00:53:05.348 --> 00:53:06.116
SURE TODAY'S GRADUATES ARE

00:53:06.182 --> 00:53:08.218
USING THE TOOLS IN A

00:53:08.285 --> 00:53:09.319
RESPONSIBLE WAY. THESE TOOLS,

00:53:09.386 --> 00:53:11.054
SUCH AS CHATGPT, WHICH WAS

00:53:11.121 --> 00:53:12.622
MENTIONED BY THE CHAIR, CAN

00:53:12.689 --> 00:53:14.090
HELP STUDENTS WITH COMPLEX

00:53:14.157 --> 00:53:16.326
ISSUES IN REALLY INCREDIBLY

00:53:16.393 --> 00:53:17.460
PERSONALIZED WAYS. THEY CAN

00:53:17.527 --> 00:53:18.862
UNLOCK RESEARCH AND PROVIDE

00:53:18.929 --> 00:53:20.130
FACULTY WITH SUPPORT THAT

00:53:20.196 --> 00:53:22.065
ALLOWS THEM TO FOCUS ON THEIR

00:53:22.132 --> 00:53:23.099
STUDENTS AND THE ACADEMIC

00:53:23.166 --> 00:53:24.301
OUTCOMES WE WANT THEM TO BE

00:53:24.367 --> 00:53:26.169
FOCUSED ON. SO I REALLY WANT TO

00:53:26.236 --> 00:53:27.971
THANK THE CSU FOR THAT AND FOR

00:53:28.038 --> 00:53:29.306
EVERYTHING THEY'RE DOING TO BE

00:53:29.372 --> 00:53:31.408
HERE TODAY, BUT ALSO FOCUS SO

00:53:31.474 --> 00:53:33.276
MUCH ON ENSURING THAT WE HAVE

00:53:33.343 --> 00:53:34.444
SUCCESSFUL STUDENTS THAT WE ARE

00:53:34.511 --> 00:53:37.113
CREATING IN THE GREAT STATE OF

00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:39.149
CALIFORNIA. BUT I WOULD BE

00:53:39.215 --> 00:53:41.184
REMISS IF I DIDN'T TALK ABOUT

00:53:41.251 --> 00:53:42.018
THE IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WE

00:53:42.085 --> 00:53:44.321
NEED TO REMEMBER AS WE FACE

00:53:44.387 --> 00:53:45.822
THIS AI FUTURE. WE NEED TO DO

00:53:45.889 --> 00:53:47.190
SO IN A WAY THAT IS INCLUSIVE.

00:53:47.257 --> 00:53:49.125
WE KNOW THAT, LIKE ALL TECH

00:53:49.192 --> 00:53:50.427
TOOLS, THERE IS A WAY WHERE

00:53:50.493 --> 00:53:52.095
MANY PEOPLE CAN BE LEFT BEHIND.

00:53:52.162 --> 00:53:54.230
I SAW DATA LAST WEEK THAT

00:53:54.297 --> 00:53:55.532
SHOWED THAT ADOPTION AMONGST

00:53:55.599 --> 00:53:58.335
WOMEN PALES IN COMPARISON TO

00:53:58.401 --> 00:54:01.338
ADOPTION AMONGST MEN. THAT IS

00:54:01.404 --> 00:54:03.039
CONCERNING FOR ME BECAUSE AS

00:54:03.106 --> 00:54:04.374
THE WORKFORCE BECOMES MORE AI

00:54:04.441 --> 00:54:06.176
CENTRIC, THOSE WOMEN CAN VERY

00:54:06.242 --> 00:54:08.278
QUICKLY BE LEFT BEHIND, WHICH

00:54:08.345 --> 00:54:10.380
IS WHY THIS PROJECT CAN BE SO

00:54:10.447 --> 00:54:11.147
CENTRAL TO CREATING EQUITY, BUT

00:54:11.214 --> 00:54:13.984
ONLY IF WE DO IT PROPERLY. IN

00:54:14.050 --> 00:54:16.186
ADDITION, WE KNOW TOOLS CAN GO

00:54:16.252 --> 00:54:17.387
WRONG. THEY CAN HAVE BIAS BAKED

00:54:17.454 --> 00:54:19.022
IN WITH BIASED DATA. AND SO WE

00:54:19.089 --> 00:54:21.224
NEED TO MAKE SURE TOOLS WE'RE

00:54:21.291 --> 00:54:21.992
DEPLOYING ARE RESPONSIBLE AND

00:54:22.058 --> 00:54:24.761
THEY CREATE THE SOCIETY WE WANT

00:54:24.828 --> 00:54:26.363
TO SEE. I WANT TO SAY THAT I'M

00:54:26.429 --> 00:54:27.931
HAPPY THE WORKERS ARE HERE

00:54:27.998 --> 00:54:29.132
TODAY, BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF

00:54:29.199 --> 00:54:31.301
THE WAYS TO BEST CREATE THE

00:54:31.368 --> 00:54:34.004
FUTURE WE WANT IN AN AI WORLD

00:54:34.070 --> 00:54:35.839
IS TO PUT THE PEOPLE AT THE

00:54:35.905 --> 00:54:37.774
TABLE WHO ARE MOST IMPACTED BY

00:54:37.841 --> 00:54:38.475
THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.

00:54:38.541 --> 00:54:39.976
AND IN THIS CONTEXT, I TRULY

00:54:40.043 --> 00:54:41.511
BELIEVE THAT IS THE CSU'S

00:54:41.578 --> 00:54:43.413
WORKERS, THE CSU FACULTY AND

00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:46.282
THE CSU STUDENTS. AND SO THEY

00:54:46.349 --> 00:54:47.717
NEED TO BE AT THE TABLE DRIVING

00:54:47.784 --> 00:54:49.252
HOW WE INTEGRATE THIS IN A SAFE

00:54:49.319 --> 00:54:52.489
AND RESPONSIBLE MANNER. PRIVACY

00:54:52.555 --> 00:54:53.923
AI HAS CREATED THE NEXT GOLD

00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:56.092
RUSH, AND THAT GOLD RUSH IS FOR

00:54:56.159 --> 00:54:58.795
OUR DATA. AND SO WE NEED TO

00:54:58.862 --> 00:54:59.362
MAKE SURE THAT AS WE CREATE

00:54:59.429 --> 00:55:02.599
THESE PARTNERSHIPS, WE

00:55:02.666 --> 00:55:03.099
UNDERSTAND THE TRUST THE

00:55:03.166 --> 00:55:04.067
CALIFORNIANS PUT IN US WHEN

00:55:04.134 --> 00:55:06.136
THEY SHARE THEIR DATA WITH US,

00:55:06.202 --> 00:55:06.970
THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY'RE

00:55:07.037 --> 00:55:07.971
SHARING THEIR DATA WITH A

00:55:08.038 --> 00:55:09.572
PRIVATE COMPANY WHEN THEY SHARE

00:55:09.639 --> 00:55:11.708
IT WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:55:11.775 --> 00:55:13.309
AND SO AS WE TAKE THAT DATA, WE

00:55:13.376 --> 00:55:14.411
NEED TO BE RESPONSIBLE WITH IT.

00:55:14.477 --> 00:55:15.912
AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO

00:55:15.979 --> 00:55:17.147
CONVERSATIONS TODAY ABOUT THE

00:55:17.213 --> 00:55:19.082
CONTRACTS AND HOW THEY WILL

00:55:19.149 --> 00:55:20.350
PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF STUDENTS

00:55:20.417 --> 00:55:22.585
AND ANYONE WHO ENGAGES WITH

00:55:22.652 --> 00:55:25.422
THESE TOOLS. LASTLY, I WOULD BE

00:55:25.488 --> 00:55:27.524
REMISS BECAUSE IT IS SOMETHING

00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:30.160
THAT IS SO DEEPLY I'M

00:55:30.226 --> 00:55:31.127
PASSIONATE ABOUT, BUT WE ARE

00:55:31.194 --> 00:55:33.196
SEEING A WAY IN WHICH THESE

00:55:33.263 --> 00:55:34.030
TOOLS ARE BECOMING THE NEXT

00:55:34.097 --> 00:55:36.066
GENERATION OF SOCIAL MEDIA. WE

00:55:36.132 --> 00:55:37.834
ARE SEEING PEOPLE ENGAGE WITH

00:55:37.901 --> 00:55:40.403
THEM IN ADDICTIVE FASHIONS. AND

00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:42.972
JUST THIS WEEK, THE NEWS WAS

00:55:43.039 --> 00:55:44.107
BROKEN THAT A YOUNG MAN TOOK

00:55:44.174 --> 00:55:47.777
HIS LIFE AT THE COACHING OF

00:55:47.844 --> 00:55:51.047
CHATGPT. AND SO AS WE TAKE

00:55:51.114 --> 00:55:52.849
PEOPLE'S CHILDREN OUT OF THEIR

00:55:52.916 --> 00:55:55.351
HOMES, MAYBE FOR THE FIRST TIME,

00:55:55.418 --> 00:55:56.352
AND WE BECOME RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:55:56.419 --> 00:56:00.156
THEM IN AN ACADEMIC SETTING, WE,

00:56:00.223 --> 00:56:01.925
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE

00:56:01.991 --> 00:56:04.160
CSU HAVE GOT TO MAKE SURE THE

00:56:04.227 --> 00:56:05.528
TOOLS THEY ARE PUTTING PUT INTO

00:56:05.595 --> 00:56:06.963
THEIR HANDS AND OUR

00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:08.098
INSTITUTIONS ARE SAFE, THAT

00:56:08.164 --> 00:56:09.933
THEY ARE NOT SYCOPHANTIC, THAT

00:56:09.999 --> 00:56:12.068
THEY ARE NOT ADDICTIVE, THAT

00:56:12.135 --> 00:56:14.137
THEY ARE ENGAGING WITH THEM IN

00:56:14.204 --> 00:56:15.505
A WAY THAT WILL PROTECT THEIR

00:56:15.572 --> 00:56:17.340
MENTAL HEALTH AND ALLOW THEM TO

00:56:17.407 --> 00:56:17.807
UNLOCK THE EDUCATIONAL

00:56:17.874 --> 00:56:20.243
POTENTIAL. AND SO ALL OF THESE

00:56:20.310 --> 00:56:21.144
THINGS NEED TO BE CENTRAL TO

00:56:21.211 --> 00:56:23.880
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OUR

00:56:23.947 --> 00:56:25.215
CONVERSATIONS AROUND THIS. SO

00:56:25.281 --> 00:56:27.217
I'M EXCITED TO HEAR ABOUT THIS

00:56:27.283 --> 00:56:29.919

HEART OF HOW WE ARE APPROACHING

00:57:59.676 --> 00:58:01.244
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. WE ARE

00:58:01.311 --> 00:58:03.913
NOT ADOPTING AI BECAUSE IT IS

00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:05.615
FASHIONABLE, BUT BECAUSE IT CAN

00:58:05.682 --> 00:58:06.349
DIRECTLY SERVE OUR STUDENTS,

FROM ACROSS THE SYSTEM. THE

00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:18.254
GENERATIVE AI COMMITTEE AND ITS

00:59:18.321 --> 00:59:19.889
SUBCOMMITTEES MET REGULARLY

00:59:19.956 --> 00:59:20.890
THROUGHOUT THE SPRING SEMESTER

00:59:20.957 --> 00:59:23.526
OF 2024, AND HIS WORK

00:59:23.593 --> 00:59:23.993
CULMINATED IN A WIDELY

00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:26.296
DISSEMINATED FINAL REPORT AND

00:59:26.362 --> 00:59:27.430

INCLUSIVITY AND EQUITABLE

00:59:34.537 --> 00:59:37.373
ACCESS. THE CSU SHOULD PROMOTE

00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:38.141
INCLUSIVE AND EQUITABLE ACCESS

00:59:38.207 --> 00:59:40.310

ENSURE THAT ALL CSU FACULTY,

00:59:41.945 --> 00:59:44.180
STAFF AND STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS

00:59:44.247 --> 00:59:45.748
TO AI TOOLS AND TRAINING

00:59:45.815 --> 00:59:47.984
NECESSARY TO LEVERAGE THEM FOR

00:59:48.051 --> 00:59:49.552
TEACHING, LEARNING, RESEARCH

00:59:49.619 --> 00:59:52.088
AND WORK. THIS FINAL REPORT OF

00:59:52.155 --> 00:59:54.390
THE CSU GENERATIVE AI COMMITTEE

00:59:54.457 --> 00:59:56.192
WAS THE FOUNDATION OF THE

00:59:56.259 --> 00:59:58.661
SYSTEM WIDE GENERATIVE AI

00:59:58.728 --> 01:00:00.964
STRATEGIC PLAN. THE PLAN

01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:02.632
PRESENTS A BROAD STRATEGY

01:00:02.699 --> 01:00:04.767
GROUNDED IN VALUES OF ETHICAL

01:00:04.834 --> 01:00:06.102
AND EQUITABLE AI USE,

01:00:06.169 --> 01:00:08.471
PRIORITIZING GOVERNANCE

01:00:08.538 --> 01:00:09.973
TRAINING, INCLUSIVE ACCESS,

01:00:10.039 --> 01:00:11.240
PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL

01:00:11.307 --> 01:00:13.876
PROPERTY, DATA STEWARDSHIP, AND

01:00:13.943 --> 01:00:16.346
ONGOING LEARNING TO ENABLE

01:00:16.412 --> 01:00:16.946
RESPONSIBLE AND TRANSFORMATIVE

01:00:17.013 --> 01:00:18.448
ADOPTION OF GENERATIVE AI

01:00:18.514 --> 01:00:20.483
ACROSS THE SYSTEM. THIS

01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:21.884
GOVERNANCE MATTERS BECAUSE AI

01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:23.186
ADOPTION IS HAPPENING RAPIDLY

01:00:23.252 --> 01:00:26.122
AND OFTEN IN FRAGMENTED WAYS.

01:00:26.189 --> 01:00:27.323
PRIOR TO THE CREATION OF OUR AI

01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:29.092
STRATEGY, THOUSANDS OF CSU

01:00:29.158 --> 01:00:31.160
STUDENTS, FACULTY, AND STAFF

01:00:31.227 --> 01:00:32.128
WERE ALREADY SIGNING UP FOR

01:00:32.195 --> 01:00:34.364
INDIVIDUAL AI TOOL

01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:36.232
SUBSCRIPTIONS. YET MANY OF OUR

01:00:36.299 --> 01:00:37.667
COMMUNITY MEMBERS COULD NOT

01:00:37.734 --> 01:00:39.268
AFFORD SUCH SUBSCRIPTIONS. SOME

01:00:39.335 --> 01:00:41.371
OF OUR UNIVERSITIES WERE

01:00:41.437 --> 01:00:42.138
EXPLORING THEIR OWN LICENSING

01:00:42.205 --> 01:00:44.807
PLANS WITH VARIOUS AI VENDORS,

01:00:44.874 --> 01:00:47.710
YET NOT ALL OF OUR UNIVERSITIES

01:00:47.777 --> 01:00:49.145
COULD AFFORD SUCH INVESTMENTS.

01:00:49.212 --> 01:00:51.214
INDEED, UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:52.315
UNITED STATES ARE FACING THE

01:00:52.382 --> 01:00:54.317
CHALLENGES OF UNEVEN ACCESS AND

01:00:54.384 --> 01:00:57.720
INCONSISTENT PROTECTIONS AMID

01:00:57.787 --> 01:00:58.888
GROWING WORKFORCE EXPECTATIONS.

01:00:58.955 --> 01:01:01.657
WE KNEW THAT THE CSU NEEDED A

01:01:01.724 --> 01:01:02.358
COORDINATED, RESPONSIBLE

01:01:02.425 --> 01:01:04.660
APPROACH THAT WOULD EXPAND

01:01:04.727 --> 01:01:06.763
OPPORTUNITY RATHER THAN DEEPEN

01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:10.066
DIVIDES. LET ME OUTLINE OUR CSU

01:01:10.133 --> 01:01:11.234
AI STRATEGY WITH SOME OF OUR

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:13.036
GUIDING PRINCIPLES. FIRST,

01:01:13.102 --> 01:01:15.438
EQUITABLE ACCESS RESPONDING TO

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:17.306
THE GENERATIVE AI COMMITTEE'S

01:01:17.373 --> 01:01:17.874
RECOMMENDATION FOR EQUITABLE

01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:20.376
ACCESS, MUCH AS WE DO FOR OTHER

01:01:20.443 --> 01:01:21.944
TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS, WE

01:01:22.011 --> 01:01:23.312
NEGOTIATED SYSTEM WIDE

01:01:23.379 --> 01:01:26.149
CONTRACTS SO THAT ALL 23

01:01:26.215 --> 01:01:27.150
CAMPUSES AND OUR 460,000

01:01:27.216 --> 01:01:29.118
STUDENTS AND 50,000 FACULTY AND

01:01:29.185 --> 01:01:30.920
STAFF COULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE

01:01:30.987 --> 01:01:32.255
SAME AI TOOLS WITH STRONG

01:01:32.321 --> 01:01:34.891
PRIVACY PROTECTIONS. THIS

01:01:34.957 --> 01:01:36.392
ENSURES THAT STUDENTS AT

01:01:36.459 --> 01:01:37.226
RESOURCE CHALLENGED CAMPUSES

01:01:37.293 --> 01:01:39.595
ENJOY THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES AS

01:01:39.662 --> 01:01:40.963
THOSE AT LARGER CAMPUSES BY

PROVIDING ACCESS FOR ALL,

01:01:43.633 --> 01:01:44.167
INCLUDING LOW INCOME STUDENTS

01:01:44.233 --> 01:01:46.169
AND UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS. WE

01:01:46.235 --> 01:01:47.837
ARE PREPARING OUR STUDENTS FOR

01:01:47.904 --> 01:01:49.472
THE WORKFORCE OF THE FUTURE.

01:01:49.539 --> 01:01:51.974
THEY WILL HAVE THE FAMILIARITY

01:01:52.041 --> 01:01:53.643
AND THE CAPABILITY TO LEVERAGE

01:01:53.709 --> 01:01:55.778
AI IN THEIR CAREERS

01:01:55.845 --> 01:01:58.114
POST-GRADUATION. TWO FACULTY

01:01:58.181 --> 01:01:59.348
ARE AT THE CENTER OF THIS

01:01:59.415 --> 01:02:01.050
EFFORT. WE WANT TO EMPHASIZE

01:02:01.117 --> 01:02:03.086
THAT THIS IS VOLUNTARY. MANY

01:02:03.152 --> 01:02:04.420
FACULTY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED FROM

01:02:04.487 --> 01:02:05.955

01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:16.017
CHATGPT EDU. THIS TECHNOLOGY,

01:19:16.084 --> 01:19:18.220
AS WE'VE ACKNOWLEDGED, IS SO

01:19:18.286 --> 01:19:20.388
NEW AND AT THIS TIME, EACH OF

01:19:20.455 --> 01:19:21.289
OUR CAMPUSES IS INDIVIDUALLY

01:19:21.356 --> 01:19:23.525
CREATING THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL

01:19:23.592 --> 01:19:26.728
DECISIONS ABOUT REQUIRED

01:19:26.795 --> 01:19:29.064
TRAINING. CERTAINLY, WE'RE OPEN

01:19:29.131 --> 01:19:30.265
TO ADDITIONAL SYSTEM WIDE

01:19:30.332 --> 01:19:31.867
REQUIREMENTS AS THIS TECHNOLOGY

01:19:31.933 --> 01:19:33.034
EVOLVES. BUT SOME OF OUR

01:19:33.101 --> 01:19:35.504
CAMPUSES, AS YOU JUST HEARD,

01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:36.004
HAVE THESE REQUIREMENTS

01:19:36.071 --> 01:19:38.573
EMERGING FOR ENTERING STUDENTS,

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:41.977
FOR EXAMPLE. SO I'LL JUST ADD

01:19:42.043 --> 01:19:44.746
THAT, LIKE AT SAN JOSE STATE, I

01:19:44.813 --> 01:19:45.881
MENTIONED THE NEW ORIENTATION.

01:19:45.947 --> 01:19:47.549
STUDENTS ARE NOW GETTING THIS

01:19:47.616 --> 01:19:49.351
AI LITERACY TRAINING AS PART OF

01:19:49.417 --> 01:19:51.319
ALL OF OUR NEW INCOMING

01:19:51.386 --> 01:19:52.220
STUDENTS ARE. AND THIS FALL,

01:19:52.287 --> 01:19:54.923
WE'RE ALSO ROLLING OUT THE SAME

01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:56.158
KIND OF TRAINING, AI LITERACY

01:19:56.224 --> 01:19:58.093
TRAINING FOR CURRENT STUDENTS

01:19:58.160 --> 01:19:59.928
AND ALSO FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS

01:19:59.995 --> 01:20:02.531
AS WELL, AND ALSO FOR OUR

01:20:02.597 --> 01:20:03.999
FACULTY. AS YOU HEARD, THERE'S

01:20:04.065 --> 01:20:06.034
A LOT OF DIFFERENT INITIATIVES

01:20:06.101 --> 01:20:07.235
FOR PROVIDING THEM WITH

01:20:07.302 --> 01:20:09.004
OPPORTUNITIES TO LEARN AND TO

01:20:09.070 --> 01:20:12.908
AS AS THEY'RE INTERESTED IN AND

01:20:12.974 --> 01:20:14.709
ACQUIRING AND LEARNING MORE

01:20:14.776 --> 01:20:16.912
ABOUT AI LITERACY. THANK YOU SO

01:20:16.978 --> 01:20:19.447
MUCH FOR THAT CONTEXT. AND JUST

01:20:19.514 --> 01:20:20.615
A FOLLOW UP ON THAT. I

01:20:20.682 --> 01:20:21.416
MENTIONED THE STUDENT

01:20:21.483 --> 01:20:24.085
AMBASSADORS LITERACY TRAINING

01:20:24.152 --> 01:20:25.854
IN TERMS OF THE SAN JOSE SAN

01:20:25.921 --> 01:20:28.056
JOSE STATE MODEL. IS THAT

01:20:28.123 --> 01:20:28.623
SOMETHING THAT CHANCELLOR'S

01:20:28.690 --> 01:20:30.892
OFFICE CAN SCALE UP SYSTEM WIDE?

01:20:30.959 --> 01:20:34.863
WELL, OUR BEST PRACTICES, YEAH.

01:20:34.930 --> 01:20:37.432
SO MOST OF OUR TRAINING THAT

01:20:37.499 --> 01:20:38.300
WE'RE PROVIDING CURRENTLY

01:20:38.366 --> 01:20:42.037
INCLUDES. ETHICAL AND

01:20:42.103 --> 01:20:43.672
RESPONSIBLE USE TRAINING OR

01:20:43.738 --> 01:20:45.140
DISCUSSIONS OR INFORMATION,

01:20:45.207 --> 01:20:47.609
INCLUDING THE BIASES ISSUES

01:20:47.676 --> 01:20:49.010
THAT YOU MENTIONED. WE SCALED

01:20:49.077 --> 01:20:51.046
THAT UP FROM SAN DIEGO STATE'S

01:20:51.112 --> 01:20:52.380
ACTIVITIES THAT WERE HAPPENING

01:20:52.447 --> 01:20:54.449
THAT THEY CREATED AT THEIR

01:20:54.516 --> 01:20:56.751
CAMPUS. AND WE CONSTANTLY,

01:20:56.818 --> 01:20:57.752
CONTINUALLY REVISE THESE

01:20:57.819 --> 01:21:00.222
COURSES. SO WE SHALL BE DOING

01:21:00.288 --> 01:21:02.324
THAT AGAIN FOR THIS ROUND, FOR

01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:04.025
THIS ACADEMIC YEAR. AND WE'LL

01:21:04.092 --> 01:21:07.529
TAKE A PARTICULAR NOTE OF THOSE

01:21:07.596 --> 01:21:09.864
AREAS WITH REGARDS TO WHAT SAN

01:21:09.931 --> 01:21:12.000
JOSE STATE IS DOING. AND

01:21:12.067 --> 01:21:13.268
BUILDING ON THAT, WE MENTIONED

01:21:13.335 --> 01:21:16.404
THE CSU AI COMMONS. WE HOST ALL

01:21:16.471 --> 01:21:18.273
THESE TRAININGS IN AN AREA THAT

01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:20.442
ANYONE IN THE CSU CAN ACCESS

01:21:20.508 --> 01:21:23.545
FOR FREE. IT'S OPEN TO ALL OF

01:21:23.612 --> 01:21:24.946
OUR CSU COMMUNITY MEMBERS.

01:21:25.013 --> 01:21:27.115
GREAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ALSO,

01:21:27.182 --> 01:21:28.850
I'D LIKE TO NOTE THAT RUTHIE

01:21:28.917 --> 01:21:31.119
BARKOW IS HERE FROM OPEN. AI IS

01:21:31.186 --> 01:21:32.420
HERE IN THE AUDIENCE AND HERE

01:21:32.487 --> 01:21:33.588
TO PROVIDE ANY TECHNICAL

01:21:33.655 --> 01:21:35.123
ASSISTANCE. THANK YOU. I'LL

01:21:35.190 --> 01:21:36.791
OPEN IT FOR MY COLLEAGUES.

01:21:36.858 --> 01:21:39.327
CHAIR BAUER. KAREN, OR. I'M

01:21:39.394 --> 01:21:41.896
SORRY, I JUST I HAVE A LOT OF

01:21:41.963 --> 01:21:43.965
QUESTIONS, BUT I DO HAVE ONE

01:21:44.032 --> 01:21:45.166
FOLLOW UP TO CHAIR FONG'S

01:21:45.233 --> 01:21:46.534
QUESTION. SO BEFORE I TURN IT

01:21:46.601 --> 01:21:48.069
OVER TO PATEL. WHAT? I JUST

01:21:48.136 --> 01:21:50.171
HEARD YOU SAY THAT AS IT

01:21:50.238 --> 01:21:51.906
RELATES TO WHAT I THINK THE

01:21:51.973 --> 01:21:52.974
LEGISLATURE BELIEVES IS A

01:21:53.041 --> 01:21:54.409
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE,

01:21:54.476 --> 01:21:55.210
WHICH IS ADDRESSING BIAS. THERE

01:21:55.277 --> 01:21:57.479
IS A PATCHWORK OF POLICIES

01:21:57.545 --> 01:21:59.648
ACROSS YOUR SYSTEM, AND THAT

01:21:59.714 --> 01:22:02.350
THE CSU ITSELF IS NOT PROVIDING

01:22:02.417 --> 01:22:04.319
GUIDANCE TO ENSURE THERE IS

01:22:04.386 --> 01:22:07.122
COHERENT POLICIES AT ALL OF OUR

01:22:07.188 --> 01:22:09.457
CAMPUSES. SO I WANT TO GIVE YOU

01:22:09.524 --> 01:22:10.091
AN OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT THAT,

01:22:10.158 --> 01:22:11.059
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I HEARD.

01:22:11.126 --> 01:22:15.096
BUT MAYBE I MISHEARD. I THINK

01:22:15.163 --> 01:22:17.132
IT WOULD BE ACCURATE TO SAY

01:22:17.198 --> 01:22:18.333
THAT, YOU KNOW, THIS AI

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:20.068
STRATEGY WAS APPROVED BY OUR

01:22:20.135 --> 01:22:21.269
BOARD IN JANUARY. WE STARTED

01:22:21.336 --> 01:22:24.306
ROLLING OUT THE TOOL, THE

01:22:24.372 --> 01:22:25.273
CHATGPT TOOL, ABOUT MIDWAY

01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:26.941
THROUGH THE SEMESTER. SO WE'VE

01:22:27.008 --> 01:22:29.477
ONLY HAD A COUPLE OF MONTHS TO

01:22:29.544 --> 01:22:30.245
EVEN GET TO THIS. NOW, OVER

01:22:30.312 --> 01:22:31.880
100,000 ACTIVATED USERS

01:22:31.946 --> 01:22:34.015
BUILDING THE TRAINING AND

01:22:34.082 --> 01:22:35.216
PROVIDING THE SUPPORT IN THE

01:22:35.283 --> 01:22:37.419
CSU AI COMMONS IS HOW WE'RE

01:22:37.485 --> 01:22:38.486
APPROACHING THIS. SO THAT

01:22:38.553 --> 01:22:40.322
TRAINING DOES INCLUDE IT DOES

01:22:40.388 --> 01:22:42.324
ADDRESS THINGS LIKE BIAS,

01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:44.859
ETHICAL THINKING, CRITICAL

01:22:44.926 --> 01:22:47.996
THINKING. AND SO THAT IS WHERE

01:22:48.063 --> 01:22:50.031
WE ARE AT THIS MOMENT WITH THIS

01:22:50.098 --> 01:22:51.132
VERY NEW TECHNOLOGY. AND IN OUR

01:22:51.199 --> 01:22:53.435
ON OUR AI COMMONS, WE HAVE A

01:22:53.501 --> 01:22:55.970
SPACE FOR EACH ONE OF OUR ROLES.

01:22:56.037 --> 01:22:57.339
AND IF YOU'RE A ROLE IN THE

01:22:57.405 --> 01:22:59.507
SYSTEM, STUDENT, FACULTY, STAFF,

01:22:59.574 --> 01:23:01.443
AND WE HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR

01:23:01.509 --> 01:23:02.844
ETHICAL, RESPONSIBLE USE IN

01:23:02.911 --> 01:23:05.647
THOSE THREE FOUR AREAS,

01:23:05.714 --> 01:23:07.415
INCLUDING ALUMNI. OKAY, SO I

01:23:07.482 --> 01:23:09.050
GUESS MY CONCERN AS I'M

01:23:09.117 --> 01:23:11.252
LISTENING TO THIS IS, YOU KNOW,

01:23:11.319 --> 01:23:12.987
YOU ROLLED IT OUT. YOU HAVE

01:23:13.054 --> 01:23:15.090
MORE USERS THAN I THINK ANY OF

01:23:15.156 --> 01:23:15.957
US, INCLUDING YOU, WOULD HAVE

01:23:16.024 --> 01:23:17.158
EXPECTED, WHICH IS GOOD NEWS IN

01:23:17.225 --> 01:23:19.594
A LOT OF WAYS. BUT I ALSO WANT

01:23:19.661 --> 01:23:20.995
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE BEING

01:23:21.062 --> 01:23:22.163
RESPONSIBLE IN THIS. AND SO,

01:23:22.230 --> 01:23:24.165
YOU KNOW, SORT OF THERE HAVE

01:23:24.232 --> 01:23:25.467
BEEN SOME IN THE AI COMMUNITY

01:23:25.533 --> 01:23:27.068
THAT BELIEVE THE WAY WE DEAL

01:23:27.135 --> 01:23:28.203
WITH SAFEGUARDING IS TO PUT IT

01:23:28.269 --> 01:23:30.305
OUT, SEE WHAT BAD HAPPENS AND

01:23:30.372 --> 01:23:32.107
THEN ADDRESS IT. I THINK WE AS

01:23:32.173 --> 01:23:33.308
GOVERNMENT HAVE MUCH MORE

01:23:33.375 --> 01:23:34.042
RESPONSIBILITY THAN THAT AND

01:23:34.109 --> 01:23:36.111
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IS NOT

01:23:36.177 --> 01:23:37.245
WHAT IS HAPPENING AT THE CSU.

01:23:37.312 --> 01:23:39.647
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE CERTAIN

01:23:39.714 --> 01:23:40.181
CAMPUSES THAT PERHAPS ARE

01:23:40.248 --> 01:23:41.249
LEADING THE WAY, BUT I WOULD

01:23:41.316 --> 01:23:43.218
HOPE THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT

01:23:43.284 --> 01:23:44.052
THAT IS HAPPENING, IT IS

01:23:44.119 --> 01:23:45.186
IMMEDIATELY BEING ROLLED OUT

01:23:45.253 --> 01:23:46.588
ACROSS THE ENTIRE SYSTEM,

01:23:46.654 --> 01:23:47.922
RATHER THAN ALLOWING EACH TO DO

01:23:47.989 --> 01:23:49.190
THEIR OWN THING. I THINK THE

01:23:49.257 --> 01:23:51.159
EXPERTISE PERHAPS, IS AT THE

01:23:51.226 --> 01:23:52.560
SYSTEM WIDE LEVEL, AND THAT

01:23:52.627 --> 01:23:53.161
EXPERTISE SHOULD BE MAKING ITS

01:23:53.228 --> 01:23:55.597
WAY TO EACH OF THE CAMPUSES.

01:23:55.663 --> 01:23:56.831
WITH THAT, I'LL TURN IT OVER TO

01:23:56.898 --> 01:23:59.033
PATEL. THANK YOU, DOCTOR PATEL.

01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:00.402
THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING

01:24:00.468 --> 01:24:01.936
HERE AND PRESENTING THE

01:24:02.003 --> 01:24:03.138
INFORMATION THAT YOU'VE DONE

01:24:03.204 --> 01:24:05.106
TODAY. I WANT TO COMMEND YOU

01:24:05.173 --> 01:24:06.007
FOR TAKING A VERY PROACTIVE

01:24:06.074 --> 01:24:07.242
APPROACH AND BEING VERY

01:24:07.308 --> 01:24:09.611
INCLUSIVE OF ALL THE PEOPLE OF

01:24:09.677 --> 01:24:11.112
THE CSU COMMUNITY, THAT THAT IS

01:24:11.179 --> 01:24:13.248
GREAT TO HEAR. A COUPLE

01:24:13.314 --> 01:24:15.216
QUESTIONS, A LITTLE MORE

01:24:15.283 --> 01:24:16.117
TECHNICAL, MAYBE. I JUST WANT

01:24:16.184 --> 01:24:18.219
TO MAKE SURE I HEARD CORRECTLY,

01:24:18.286 --> 01:24:20.188
DOCTOR KENNEDY, WHEN YOU SAID

01:24:20.255 --> 01:24:21.289
THAT THE LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS

01:24:21.356 --> 01:24:23.858
ARE SORT OF INTERNAL, THEY

01:24:23.925 --> 01:24:25.960
DON'T ALLOW FOR ANYONE TO TAKE

01:24:26.027 --> 01:24:27.162
ANY INFORMATION OUT OF IT TO

01:24:27.228 --> 01:24:29.998
MAKE OUR STUDENTS INFORMATION

01:24:30.064 --> 01:24:32.066
VULNERABLE. ARE THESE CLOSED AI

01:24:32.133 --> 01:24:32.934
SYSTEMS THAT YOU'VE NOW

01:24:33.001 --> 01:24:35.136
LICENSED FROM OPENAI? CORRECT.

01:24:35.203 --> 01:24:37.238
IT'S IN OUR LICENSE AGREEMENT.

01:24:37.305 --> 01:24:40.041
AND HOW IS IT USING THE INPUTS

01:24:40.108 --> 01:24:42.177
AND OUTPUTS TO DEVELOP ITS OWN,

01:24:42.243 --> 01:24:44.145
TO EVOLVE IN ITS OWN INTERNAL

01:24:44.212 --> 01:24:46.281
SYSTEM? AND AT WHAT POINT DO

01:24:46.347 --> 01:24:48.082
YOU THEN OPEN IT UP TO NEW

01:24:48.149 --> 01:24:50.251
INPUTS FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES?

01:24:50.318 --> 01:24:52.053
HOW OFTEN DOES THAT PROCESS

01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:54.189
HAPPEN? I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH

01:24:54.255 --> 01:24:55.557
THAT ALGORITHM OR THAT DYNAMIC.

01:24:55.623 --> 01:24:57.992
ARE YOU? SO WE WE DEFINITELY

01:24:58.059 --> 01:24:59.527
WORKING WITH AND ACTUALLY WE

01:24:59.594 --> 01:25:00.161
HAVE AN EXPERT FROM OPENAI THAT

01:25:00.228 --> 01:25:02.497
MIGHT BE BETTER POSITIONED TO

01:25:02.564 --> 01:25:03.231
ANSWER THIS QUESTION, BUT WE

01:25:03.298 --> 01:25:04.966
DEFINITELY GET UPGRADES.

01:25:05.033 --> 01:25:06.301
WHENEVER OPENAI UPGRADES THEIR

01:25:06.367 --> 01:25:08.303
MODEL, WE GET THE SAME UPGRADE,

01:25:08.369 --> 01:25:09.938
BUT OUR OWN DATA AND

01:25:10.004 --> 01:25:11.239
INTERACTIONS ARE ALL HELD IN

01:25:11.306 --> 01:25:13.942
OUR OWN PRIVATE SPACE. SO

01:25:14.008 --> 01:25:16.077
THAT'S WHY THEY CAN'T BE USED

01:25:16.144 --> 01:25:17.378
BY OPENAI OR ANY OTHER THIRD

01:25:17.445 --> 01:25:19.080
PARTIES TO TRAIN MODELS. WOULD

01:25:19.147 --> 01:25:21.015
YOU LIKE TO HAVE THE TECHNICAL

01:25:21.082 --> 01:25:24.018
EXPERT JOIN US? IS RUTHIE HERE?

01:25:24.085 --> 01:25:25.019
YES. SHE'S HERE. PLEASE COME ON

01:25:25.086 --> 01:25:27.956
UP. YES. THANK YOU. RIGHT HERE,

01:25:28.022 --> 01:25:34.329
RIGHT HERE. OKAY. DO YOU HAVE

01:25:34.395 --> 01:25:35.897
ANYTHING YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD

01:25:35.964 --> 01:25:39.501
TO THAT? I AGREE WITH DOCTOR.

01:25:39.567 --> 01:25:41.636
SORRY, MADAM CHAIR, PLEASE.

01:25:41.703 --> 01:25:43.204
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION,

01:25:43.271 --> 01:25:44.939
REPRESENTATIVE PATEL. THE I

01:25:45.006 --> 01:25:46.241
AGREE WITH DOCTOR CLARK'S

01:25:46.307 --> 01:25:48.610
COMMENT. SO WE DO NOT HAVE

01:25:48.676 --> 01:25:50.144
ACCESS TO THE DATA. THE IP AND

01:25:50.211 --> 01:25:52.180
THE DATA IS ULTIMATELY OWNED BY

01:25:52.247 --> 01:25:54.148
THE STUDENT. I DEFER TO, YOU

01:25:54.215 --> 01:25:56.484
KNOW, HOW THIS IS ADMINISTRATED

01:25:56.551 --> 01:25:58.219
BY THE CSU SYSTEM AS WELL. AND

01:25:58.286 --> 01:25:59.120
THEN WE ALSO DO NOT TRAIN ON

01:25:59.187 --> 01:26:01.222
THE DATA. OKAY. THANK YOU. SO

01:26:01.289 --> 01:26:02.891
IF THE DATA IS SELF CONTAINED,

01:26:02.957 --> 01:26:05.460
IS IS THERE ANY ASSUMPTION THAT

01:26:05.527 --> 01:26:07.896
EACH INDIVIDUAL USER HAS

01:26:07.962 --> 01:26:10.164
PRIVACY OF THEIR OWN INPUTS. SO

01:26:10.231 --> 01:26:11.299
THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IS NOT

01:26:11.366 --> 01:26:14.335
LOOKING AT HAS NO AWARENESS OF

01:26:14.402 --> 01:26:16.371
WHAT INPUTS ARE BEING PUT INTO

01:26:16.437 --> 01:26:18.006
THE SYSTEM. CORRECT? THAT'S

01:26:18.072 --> 01:26:20.141
CORRECT. IF A STUDENT IS TO

01:26:20.208 --> 01:26:21.042
ENCOUNTER SOMETHING THAT THEY

01:26:21.109 --> 01:26:23.545
OR A USER IS TO ENCOUNTER

01:26:23.611 --> 01:26:24.646
SOMETHING THAT THEY CONSIDER

01:26:24.712 --> 01:26:25.847
BIASED, IS THERE A FLAGGING

01:26:25.914 --> 01:26:28.116
SYSTEM FOR THAT? THERE IS.

01:26:28.182 --> 01:26:29.817
THERE ARE WAYS THAT YOU CAN

01:26:29.884 --> 01:26:31.085
REPORT, YOU KNOW, THAT YOU'RE

01:26:31.152 --> 01:26:33.121
UNHAPPY WITH AN INTERACTION.

01:26:33.187 --> 01:26:33.922
AND ACTUALLY IT'S PARTLY BAKED

01:26:33.988 --> 01:26:36.157
INTO THE TOOL. BUT CERTAINLY

01:26:36.224 --> 01:26:37.258
WE'RE EXPECTING OUR COMMUNITY

01:26:37.325 --> 01:26:38.893
TO LET US KNOW ABOUT THAT,

01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:40.995
THOSE THINGS WHEN THEY ARISE.

01:26:41.062 --> 01:26:42.330
AND IS THERE A SYSTEM LIKE IS

01:26:42.397 --> 01:26:45.133
THERE A CHECKBOX ON A WEBSITE

01:26:45.199 --> 01:26:46.734
THAT SAYS, HEY, FLAG, WHAT YOU

01:26:46.801 --> 01:26:50.038
GOT FROM OPENAI? HOW IS WHEN

01:26:50.104 --> 01:26:52.373
YOU'RE IN WHEN WE'RE IN CHATGPT,

01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:55.310
OPENAI, OUR VERSION, THERE'S A

01:26:55.376 --> 01:26:58.046
SPACE WHERE ONE CAN REPORT, YES,

01:26:58.112 --> 01:27:00.348
THOSE KINDS OF THAT'S GREAT.

01:27:00.415 --> 01:27:02.116
YEAH, IT'S GOOD TO HEAR BECAUSE

01:27:02.183 --> 01:27:04.419
I THINK OUR YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY

01:27:04.485 --> 01:27:06.020
ARE VERY HAVE A GREAT SENSE OF

01:27:06.087 --> 01:27:08.556
AWARENESS, AND THEY WANT TO BE

01:27:08.623 --> 01:27:10.024
PROACTIVE IN HOW THEY ENGAGE

01:27:10.091 --> 01:27:12.126
WITH AI. THEY ARE NATIVES, THEY

01:27:12.193 --> 01:27:13.928
ARE AI NATIVES, SO TO SPEAK.

01:27:13.995 --> 01:27:15.897
AND SO THEY'RE VERY OPEN WITH

01:27:15.964 --> 01:27:17.165
POINTING OUT BIAS. I'VE GOT

01:27:17.231 --> 01:27:18.866
THREE YOUNG PEOPLE, 20 YEAR OLD,

01:27:18.933 --> 01:27:21.069
A 17 YEAR OLD AND A 15 YEAR OLD,

01:27:21.135 --> 01:27:22.337
AND THEY'RE VERY CLEAR WITH

01:27:22.403 --> 01:27:23.037
WHAT THEY SEE AS FAKE

01:27:23.104 --> 01:27:25.306
INFORMATION. THEY WILL SHARE IT

01:27:25.373 --> 01:27:26.274
BACK WITH ME. ANOTHER QUESTION

01:27:26.341 --> 01:27:31.012
I HAVE IS THAT IS THERE A PLAN?

01:27:31.079 --> 01:27:32.747
OR MAYBE IT'S ALREADY ONGOING

01:27:32.814 --> 01:27:35.116
FOR WORKING WITH OUR LOCAL HIGH

01:27:35.183 --> 01:27:38.286
SCHOOLS IN THE REGION FOR

01:27:38.353 --> 01:27:38.953
HELPING THEM DEVELOP BEST

01:27:39.020 --> 01:27:40.188
PRACTICES? MAYBE IF YOU HAVE

01:27:40.254 --> 01:27:41.823
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS THAT ARE

01:27:41.889 --> 01:27:43.224
DUAL ENROLLED, OR PERHAPS YOU

01:27:43.291 --> 01:27:44.258
HAVE AP COURSES THAT ARE

01:27:44.325 --> 01:27:46.294
INTENDED TO BE COLLEGE LEVEL

01:27:46.361 --> 01:27:48.129
COURSES, ARE WE ABLE TO PROVIDE

01:27:48.196 --> 01:27:50.164
ANY OF THAT INFORMATION TO OUR

01:27:50.231 --> 01:27:51.199
LOCAL SCHOOL JURISDICTIONS, SO

01:27:51.265 --> 01:27:53.735
THAT THEY'RE ALSO HELPING

01:27:53.801 --> 01:27:54.969
PREPARE STUDENTS FOR WHAT

01:27:55.036 --> 01:27:57.005
THEY'RE GOING TO ENCOUNTER ON A

01:27:57.071 --> 01:27:58.373
COLLEGE CAMPUS? AND WE'RE VERY

01:27:58.439 --> 01:28:00.274
AWARE THAT WE TEACH OVER 50% OF

01:28:00.341 --> 01:28:01.476
THE TEACHERS ARE PREPARED, THE

01:28:01.542 --> 01:28:03.111
50% OF THE TEACHERS IN THE

01:28:03.177 --> 01:28:05.380
STATE. SO WE ARE FOCUSING ON

01:28:05.446 --> 01:28:07.148
THOSE PRE-SERVICE TEACHERS AND

01:28:07.215 --> 01:28:08.950
PROVIDING SEVERAL OF OUR GRANTS

01:28:09.017 --> 01:28:11.119
TO THE TO THOSE AREAS SO THAT

01:28:11.185 --> 01:28:13.321
THEY CAN STRATEGIZE, CREATE

01:28:13.388 --> 01:28:16.324
DIFFERENT WAYS OF PREPARING

01:28:16.391 --> 01:28:18.126
STUDENTS IN THEIR COURSEWORK IN

01:28:18.192 --> 01:28:20.495
THE FUTURE OR THEIR TEACHING

01:28:20.561 --> 01:28:22.864
ENVIRONMENTS. AND WE DO HAVE A

01:28:22.930 --> 01:28:24.999
WAYS TO GO, THOUGH, TO GO TO

01:28:25.066 --> 01:28:26.334
ACTUALLY, I THINK YOU'RE SAYING

01:28:26.401 --> 01:28:29.737
BE PART OF THE K-12 SYSTEM,

01:28:29.804 --> 01:28:31.406
PROVIDING BEST PRACTICES

01:28:31.472 --> 01:28:32.974
BECAUSE THOSE HIGH SCHOOL

01:28:33.041 --> 01:28:35.109
STUDENTS WHO MAY BE DUAL

01:28:35.176 --> 01:28:36.044
ENROLLED IN A COLLEGE CLASS OR

01:28:36.110 --> 01:28:39.914
IN AN AP CLASS, WHERE WE'RE

01:28:39.981 --> 01:28:41.149
WHERE THEY BELIEVE THEY ARE

01:28:41.215 --> 01:28:43.084
TAKING A COLLEGE LEVEL CLASS,

01:28:43.151 --> 01:28:44.419
AP CLASSES ARE SUPPOSED TO GIVE

01:28:44.485 --> 01:28:45.987
THAT ENVIRONMENT OF THAT SAME

01:28:46.054 --> 01:28:47.288
ACADEMIC LEVEL OF ACHIEVEMENT,

01:28:47.355 --> 01:28:48.856
AND IF THEY'RE ENROLLED IN OUR

01:28:48.923 --> 01:28:50.058
SYSTEM, THEN THEY CAN GET

01:28:50.124 --> 01:28:51.225
ACCESS TO ANY OF OUR TRAINING

01:28:51.292 --> 01:28:53.594
AND RESOURCES. EVEN THE THE

01:28:53.661 --> 01:28:54.195
CLOSED VERSION OF CHATGPT AS

01:28:54.262 --> 01:28:57.265
WELL. BUT WE WILL TAKE THAT AS

01:28:57.331 --> 01:28:59.367
A BACK AS AN ADVISEMENT AND SEE

01:28:59.434 --> 01:29:01.069
WHAT WE CAN DO MOVING FORWARD

01:29:01.135 --> 01:29:02.236
TO SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE FOR

01:29:02.303 --> 01:29:03.204
THOSE HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUSES.

01:29:03.271 --> 01:29:05.106
YEAH, WE WERE THINKING MORE OF

01:29:05.173 --> 01:29:06.174
THE TEACHERS PREPARING THEM FOR

01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:08.142
THAT AS WELL. SO YEAH, AND THAT

01:29:08.209 --> 01:29:10.478
TRICKLES SOMETIMES DOESN'T

01:29:10.545 --> 01:29:12.914
PERMEATE. YEAH. YEAH. SO THANK

01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:15.349
YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK

01:29:15.416 --> 01:29:16.984
YOU SO MUCH. DOCTOR PATEL.

01:29:17.051 --> 01:29:20.188
MADAM CHAIR BAUER-KAHAN. THANK

01:29:20.254 --> 01:29:23.191
YOU I'M GOING TO FIRST I WANT

01:29:23.257 --> 01:29:24.892
TO JUST START WITH MY OWN

01:29:24.959 --> 01:29:25.927
COMMENT, BUT THEN I HAVE

01:29:25.993 --> 01:29:28.096
PROPELLER AND HAD TO GO TO AN

01:29:28.162 --> 01:29:28.930
IMPORTANT MEETING, SO SHE ASKED

01:29:28.996 --> 01:29:30.965
ME TO ASK HER QUESTIONS, IF YOU

01:29:31.032 --> 01:29:32.066
DON'T MIND. BUT BEFORE I DO, I

01:29:32.133 --> 01:29:34.368
WANTED TO SAY THAT I DID READ

01:29:34.435 --> 01:29:36.003
THE REPORT THE JOINT COMMITTEE

01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:37.271
ON EDUCATION POLICY AND FINANCE

01:29:37.338 --> 01:29:39.307
REPORT ON THE PROJECT, AND IT

01:29:39.373 --> 01:29:40.208
INCLUDED SOME HIGHLIGHTED

01:29:40.274 --> 01:29:42.677
CLASSES THAT YOU WERE TEACHING

01:29:42.744 --> 01:29:44.045
OR PROJECTS OUT OF THEIR

01:29:44.112 --> 01:29:45.012
CLASSES OR PROJECTS ON AI

01:29:45.079 --> 01:29:47.315
ETHICS. FOR ANYONE THAT HASN'T

01:29:47.381 --> 01:29:49.016
SEEN THAT, IT WAS ACTUALLY VERY

01:29:49.083 --> 01:29:50.184
IMPRESSIVE AND I THINK THAT

01:29:50.251 --> 01:29:51.819
THIS IS REALLY EXCITING. I WILL

01:29:51.886 --> 01:29:53.955
SAY ONE OF I BELIEVE IT WAS

01:29:54.021 --> 01:29:56.190
LAST WEEK THERE WAS THE NEWS

01:29:56.257 --> 01:29:58.426
BROKE AROUND META'S TRAINING

01:29:58.493 --> 01:30:04.065
DOCUMENT FOR THEIR AI MODEL. IT

01:30:04.132 --> 01:30:05.867
HAD BEEN APPROVED BY THEIR

01:30:05.933 --> 01:30:07.135
CHIEF ETHICIST, AND IT INCLUDED

01:30:07.201 --> 01:30:10.972
THE ABILITY TO ASK A CHILD. THE

01:30:11.038 --> 01:30:13.407
TRAINING DOCUMENT SAID THAT IT

01:30:13.474 --> 01:30:15.476
WAS ACCEPTABLE TO ENGAGE A

01:30:15.543 --> 01:30:17.411
CHILD IN CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE

01:30:17.478 --> 01:30:19.213
ROMANTIC OR SENSUAL. THAT CHIEF

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:20.915
ETHICIST AT META APPROVED THIS.

01:30:20.982 --> 01:30:22.283
IT ALSO SAID THAT IT WAS

01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:23.951
UNACCEPTABLE TO DESCRIBE A

01:30:24.018 --> 01:30:26.053
CHILD UNDER 13 IN TERMS THAT

01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:27.321
INDICATE THEY ARE SEXUALLY

01:30:27.388 --> 01:30:28.923
DESIRABLE. BUT A 13 YEAR OLD.

01:30:28.990 --> 01:30:30.057
APPARENTLY IT'S OKAY FOR THE

01:30:30.124 --> 01:30:32.460
MODELS TO DESCRIBE AS DESIRABLE

01:30:32.527 --> 01:30:35.029
TO ME. WHAT THIS ACTUALLY SAID

01:30:35.096 --> 01:30:36.998
TO ME WAS THAT WE WE HAVE NOT

01:30:37.064 --> 01:30:39.200
DONE ENOUGH TO DIVE INTO WHAT

01:30:39.267 --> 01:30:40.802
ARE THE ETHICS OF TRAINING

01:30:40.868 --> 01:30:42.069
THESE MODELS, SUCH THAT WE HAVE

01:30:42.136 --> 01:30:44.205
PEOPLE IN THE ROLES TO READ

01:30:44.272 --> 01:30:46.240
THAT AND SAY, CLEARLY, THIS IS

01:30:46.307 --> 01:30:47.074
NOT ETHICAL TRAINING. WE DON'T

01:30:47.141 --> 01:30:49.076
WANT CHILDREN TO BE TREATED

01:30:49.143 --> 01:30:51.546
THIS WAY IN SOCIETY. AND SO I

01:30:51.612 --> 01:30:53.181
THINK THAT THE THE UNIVERSITY

01:30:53.247 --> 01:30:55.383
SYSTEM DIVING INTO WHAT OUR AI

01:30:55.449 --> 01:30:57.118
ETHICS IN A WAY ONLY

01:30:57.185 --> 01:30:59.120
UNIVERSITIES FRANKLY CAN, IS

01:30:59.187 --> 01:30:59.887
ACTUALLY A REALLY EXCITING

01:30:59.954 --> 01:31:01.222
THING BECAUSE I THINK IT WILL

01:31:01.289 --> 01:31:03.090
ALLOW US TO ENGAGE IN

01:31:03.157 --> 01:31:04.091
CONVERSATIONS THAT PRODUCE THE

01:31:04.158 --> 01:31:06.160
NEXT GENERATION OF AI ETHICISTS

01:31:06.227 --> 01:31:07.328
THAT WILL LEAD IN RESPONSIBLE

01:31:07.395 --> 01:31:08.996
WAYS. AND SO I REALLY WANTED TO

01:31:09.063 --> 01:31:09.997
HIGHLIGHT THAT, BECAUSE I THINK

01:31:10.064 --> 01:31:11.365
THAT'S AN AMAZINGLY EXCITING

01:31:11.432 --> 01:31:12.433
THING THAT THE UNIVERSITIES ARE

01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:16.904
DOING. SO WITH THAT, I WANT TO

01:31:16.971 --> 01:31:18.940
TURN IT OVER TO MISS PELLERIN'S

01:31:19.006 --> 01:31:20.641
QUESTIONS. SO THE FIRST ONE WAS

01:31:20.708 --> 01:31:21.909
ON ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. SHE

01:31:21.976 --> 01:31:23.010
WANTED TO KNOW IF THE

01:31:23.077 --> 01:31:25.213
UNIVERSITY, IF THE CSU SYSTEM

01:31:25.279 --> 01:31:26.414
HAD LOOKED AT THE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:28.082
IMPACT IN TERMS OF ENERGY AND

01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:32.019
WATER USAGE OF YOUR IMMENSE

01:31:32.086 --> 01:31:33.221
NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT ARE

01:31:33.287 --> 01:31:35.890
GOING TO BE USING THESE MODELS,

01:31:35.957 --> 01:31:37.959
AND IF SO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING

01:31:38.025 --> 01:31:39.327
ABOUT IT? YES, WE'VE WE'RE

01:31:39.393 --> 01:31:41.229
CONTRACTING. WE WANT TO TRACK

01:31:41.295 --> 01:31:42.630
ALL OF THE SORT OF THE IMPACTS

01:31:42.697 --> 01:31:44.332
OF WHAT WE'RE DOING, BOTH

01:31:44.398 --> 01:31:45.066
POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE. SO WE

01:31:45.132 --> 01:31:46.968
HAVE AN ACTUAL METRICS

01:31:47.034 --> 01:31:48.302
INITIATIVE WHERE WE'RE

01:31:48.369 --> 01:31:49.937
COLLECTING, YOU KNOW,

01:31:50.004 --> 01:31:53.074
EVERYTHING FROM ADOPTION TO

01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:54.041
POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

01:31:54.108 --> 01:31:56.310
AND HOW WE WOULD MEASURE THOSE

01:31:56.377 --> 01:32:00.014
THINGS. AND SO THAT THAT THAT

01:32:00.081 --> 01:32:01.749
METRICS EFFORT IS NOT GOING TO

01:32:01.816 --> 01:32:03.084
BE COMPLETED FOR ANOTHER MONTH.

01:32:03.150 --> 01:32:05.119
BUT IT'S ONE OF THESE THINGS

01:32:05.186 --> 01:32:06.287
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO TRACK.

01:32:06.354 --> 01:32:08.089
THAT'S GREAT. AND I WILL SAY

01:32:08.155 --> 01:32:09.857
NOW SPEAKING FOR MYSELF, JUST

01:32:09.924 --> 01:32:11.325
SO WE'RE CLEAR, I THINK THAT

01:32:11.392 --> 01:32:13.094
AGAIN, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:14.195
OUR UNIVERSITIES CAN REALLY

01:32:14.262 --> 01:32:15.263
HELP US UNDERSTAND HOW TO

01:32:15.329 --> 01:32:16.063
NAVIGATE IN THE FUTURE, AND

01:32:16.130 --> 01:32:18.065
HOPEFULLY WE CAN TAKE YOUR OWN

01:32:18.132 --> 01:32:19.267
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND TURN IT

01:32:19.333 --> 01:32:21.068
INTO, YOU KNOW, LEARNING SUCH

01:32:21.135 --> 01:32:22.236
THAT, YOU KNOW, THE PRIVATE

01:32:22.303 --> 01:32:24.605
SECTOR AND US CAN BE MORE

01:32:24.672 --> 01:32:25.139
RESPONSIBLE IN THE

01:32:25.206 --> 01:32:26.374
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT THAT WE

01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:28.142
HAVE AS WE CONTINUE OUR AI

01:32:28.209 --> 01:32:30.044
REVOLUTION. OKAY, HER SECOND

01:32:30.111 --> 01:32:32.013
QUESTION. WE KNOW THAT THE USE

01:32:32.079 --> 01:32:33.748
OF AI TO GENERATE IMAGE BASED

01:32:33.814 --> 01:32:35.549
SEXUAL ABUSE IS BECOMING

01:32:35.616 --> 01:32:36.284
INCREASINGLY WIDESPREAD, AS

01:32:36.350 --> 01:32:38.185
THEY'RE EASILY ACCESSIBLE AND

01:32:38.252 --> 01:32:39.053
VERY ACTIVE. BLOGS AND

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:40.988
MESSAGING FORUMS ABOUT HOW TO

01:32:41.055 --> 01:32:42.857
BYPASS THE SAFEGUARDS OF THE

01:32:42.924 --> 01:32:44.992
MODELS TO GENERATE SEXUAL

01:32:45.059 --> 01:32:46.861
CONTENT. AND FRANKLY, I'LL ADD

01:32:46.928 --> 01:32:48.930
THIS. I THINK THERE ARE SOME

01:32:48.996 --> 01:32:50.765
MODELS THAT DON'T HAVE THOSE

01:32:50.831 --> 01:32:51.332
SAFEGUARDS. WE HAVE SOMEONE

01:32:51.399 --> 01:32:52.366
SITTING HERE. I THINK CHATGPT

01:32:52.433 --> 01:32:53.501
DOES HAVE THOSE SAFEGUARDS, BUT

01:32:53.567 --> 01:32:55.102
NOT ALL MODELS DO. WHAT

01:32:55.169 --> 01:32:56.337
ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARDS HAVE YOU

01:32:56.404 --> 01:32:58.172
DEVELOPED FOR THIS VERSION TO

01:32:58.239 --> 01:33:00.708
MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STUDENTS

01:33:00.775 --> 01:33:01.809
ARE NOT GETTING AROUND THE

01:33:01.876 --> 01:33:05.413
PROTECTIONS THAT ARE BUILT INTO

01:33:05.479 --> 01:33:09.116
CHATGPT? THESE SORT OF

01:33:09.183 --> 01:33:10.818
MALICIOUS PROMPT INJECTIONS,

01:33:10.885 --> 01:33:12.219
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT

01:33:12.286 --> 01:33:14.322
PEOPLE MIGHT USE WOULD VIOLATE

01:33:14.388 --> 01:33:16.357
THE CSU'S ACCEPTABLE USE

01:33:16.424 --> 01:33:17.258
POLICIES. WE HAVE ACCEPTABLE

01:33:17.325 --> 01:33:18.893
USE POLICIES THAT PREVENT YOU

01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:20.261
FROM COMMITTING CRIMES ON THE

01:33:20.328 --> 01:33:21.696
INTERNET, FOR EXAMPLE. AND

01:33:21.762 --> 01:33:22.997
THESE SAME ACCEPTABLE USE

01:33:23.064 --> 01:33:24.899
POLICIES APPLY HERE TO HOW YOU

01:33:24.966 --> 01:33:27.168
WOULD USE THIS TOOL. AND SO

01:33:27.234 --> 01:33:29.003
THEN SHE WANTS TO KNOW, GIVEN

01:33:29.070 --> 01:33:31.005
THAT IT WOULD BE A VIOLATION OF

01:33:31.072 --> 01:33:32.173
YOUR ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY,

01:33:32.239 --> 01:33:33.040
WHAT WILL THE DISCIPLINARY

01:33:33.107 --> 01:33:34.976
PROCESS BE? WILL THE FIRST

01:33:35.042 --> 01:33:36.077
OFFENSE RESULT IN EXPULSION?

01:33:36.143 --> 01:33:37.278
WILL THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS

01:33:37.345 --> 01:33:38.379
FOR MISUSE BE? IS IT CLEARLY

01:33:38.446 --> 01:33:39.947
STATED? DO STUDENTS KNOW WHAT

01:33:40.014 --> 01:33:41.048
HAPPENS IF THEY MISUSE THESE

01:33:41.115 --> 01:33:42.850
TOOLS? ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE IS

01:33:42.917 --> 01:33:44.151
SOMETHING ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES

01:33:44.218 --> 01:33:45.686
HERE COULD PROBABLY ANSWER

01:33:45.753 --> 01:33:47.188
BETTER. YEAH, AND IT WILL, AND

01:33:47.254 --> 01:33:48.923
I'LL DEFER TO YOU IN A SECOND.

01:33:48.990 --> 01:33:50.124
BUT EVERY CAMPUS HAS ITS

01:33:50.191 --> 01:33:51.225
STUDENT CONDUCT POLICIES, SO IT

01:33:51.292 --> 01:33:53.027
WOULD DEPEND ON THE CAMPUS

01:33:53.094 --> 01:33:54.762
WHERE THAT ACTIVITY HAPPENS AS

01:33:54.829 --> 01:33:56.364
TO HOW THEY WOULD BE

01:33:56.430 --> 01:33:57.932
DISCIPLINED AND SO ON. I'M NOT

01:33:57.999 --> 01:33:59.300
SURE IF YOU. YEAH, I DON'T HAVE

01:33:59.367 --> 01:34:01.302
ANYTHING MORE TO ADD. I MEAN

01:34:01.369 --> 01:34:02.069
THAT WOULD THAT WE DO HAVE

01:34:02.136 --> 01:34:04.205
ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE PROCESSES

01:34:04.271 --> 01:34:06.007
ON CAMPUS. AND SO IT WOULD BE

01:34:06.073 --> 01:34:09.443
HANDLED ALONG THOSE LINES AND

01:34:09.510 --> 01:34:13.814
AS AS AND MERITED. OKAY. WELL I

01:34:13.881 --> 01:34:16.150
HOPE THAT AS YOU ARE ONBOARDING

01:34:16.217 --> 01:34:18.386
STUDENTS, I MEAN NON-CONSENSUAL

01:34:18.452 --> 01:34:19.020
NOTIFICATION, WHICH IS

01:34:19.086 --> 01:34:21.188
SOMETHING THAT IS HAPPENING AND

01:34:21.255 --> 01:34:24.925
IS COMPLETELY UPSETTING AND

01:34:24.992 --> 01:34:26.260
DESTRUCTIVE TO PEOPLE AND THEIR

01:34:26.327 --> 01:34:27.995
MENTAL HEALTH, I HOPE THAT

01:34:28.062 --> 01:34:30.064
STUDENTS ARE BEING THIS IS

01:34:30.131 --> 01:34:32.166
EXPRESSLY ADDRESSED AND THEY

01:34:32.233 --> 01:34:32.867
UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCES,

01:34:32.933 --> 01:34:34.135
AND THE CONSEQUENCES ARE REAL.

01:34:34.201 --> 01:34:36.003
IF I COULD JUST ADD, I WOULD

01:34:36.070 --> 01:34:37.138
HOPE THAT IT WAS CONSISTENT

01:34:37.204 --> 01:34:39.006
ACROSS THE SYSTEM FOR SOME

01:34:39.073 --> 01:34:40.307
REASON, I'M SURPRISED. MAYBE I

01:34:40.374 --> 01:34:41.075
DON'T SIT ON HIGHER ED. I'M

01:34:41.142 --> 01:34:43.411
SURPRISED BY THAT. THERE'S NOT

01:34:43.477 --> 01:34:44.145
MORE CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE

01:34:44.211 --> 01:34:45.012
SYSTEM ON WE NEED MORE

01:34:45.079 --> 01:34:46.013
CONSISTENCY. OKAY, THAT'S A

01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:48.115
GOOD POINT THERE. I WAS JUST

01:34:48.182 --> 01:34:50.117
GOING TO SAY THAT'S PART OF THE

01:34:50.184 --> 01:34:52.153
IMPETUS FOR US TO CREATE THE

01:34:52.219 --> 01:34:54.622
NOVA THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT,

01:34:54.688 --> 01:34:55.856
AND THAT CROSS-CAMPUS

01:34:55.923 --> 01:34:57.324
COLLABORATION AT SAN JOSE STATE

01:34:57.391 --> 01:34:59.226
IS TO BRING TOGETHER THE

01:34:59.293 --> 01:35:00.895
VARIOUS LEADERS WHO TOUCH

01:35:00.961 --> 01:35:02.196
STUDENTS IN DIFFERENT WAYS,

01:35:02.263 --> 01:35:03.431
WHETHER IT'S THROUGH WRITING OR

01:35:03.497 --> 01:35:05.299
THROUGH THE STUDENT SERVICES.

01:35:05.366 --> 01:35:07.568
SUPPORT WELLNESS LOOKING ACROSS

01:35:07.635 --> 01:35:09.170
SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT

01:35:09.236 --> 01:35:11.138
WE TREAT STUDENTS AND FACULTY

01:35:11.205 --> 01:35:13.007
LIKE DEAL WITH IT IN A HOLISTIC

01:35:13.074 --> 01:35:16.110
WAY, AND TO FLAG ANY KINDS OF

01:35:16.177 --> 01:35:17.311
CONCERNS THAT ARE EMERGING SO

01:35:17.378 --> 01:35:19.914
THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THEM IN A

01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:22.249
MORE SYSTEMATIC BASIS. YEAH,

01:35:22.316 --> 01:35:24.051
AND OBVIOUSLY THE MODEL CAN'T I

01:35:24.118 --> 01:35:25.152
DON'T THINK, ANTICIPATE

01:35:25.219 --> 01:35:25.920
EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING TO

01:35:25.986 --> 01:35:27.655
HAPPEN. AND IT IS UPON STUDENTS

01:35:27.721 --> 01:35:28.255
TO USE ALL TECHNOLOGY

01:35:28.322 --> 01:35:30.124
RESPONSIBLY. SO WE NEED TO SEE

01:35:30.191 --> 01:35:31.192
THAT. HER NEXT QUESTION IS

01:35:31.258 --> 01:35:32.293
WE'VE SEEN INCREASED REPORTS OF

01:35:32.359 --> 01:35:33.928
PEOPLE USING CHATGPT AS

01:35:33.994 --> 01:35:35.129
THERAPISTS, ALTHOUGH I THINK

01:35:35.196 --> 01:35:36.063
THAT'S A GENEROUS TERM. THEY'RE

01:35:36.130 --> 01:35:38.365
NOT ACTUALLY THERAPISTS, BUT

01:35:38.432 --> 01:35:41.135
AND FALLING IN LOVE WITH AI

01:35:41.202 --> 01:35:43.704
PARTNERS, WHAT WHAT SAFEGUARDS

01:35:43.771 --> 01:35:45.973
HAVE YOU DEVELOPED TO PROTECT

01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:51.112
STUDENTS FROM THIS? THIS IS THE

01:35:51.178 --> 01:35:52.346
SECURITY AND SAFETY OF OUR

01:35:52.413 --> 01:35:53.981
STUDENTS IS PARAMOUNT FOR US IN

01:35:54.048 --> 01:35:56.117
THE CSU. WE ARE ALWAYS TRYING

01:35:56.183 --> 01:35:58.385
TO LOOK AT HOW ANY TECHNOLOGY

01:35:58.452 --> 01:36:01.288
MIGHT BE, AGAIN USED OR MISUSED.

01:36:01.355 --> 01:36:03.023
RIGHT. AND THAT THAT'S IT'S A

01:36:03.090 --> 01:36:05.126
VERY NEW TOPIC FOR US, AND

01:36:05.192 --> 01:36:06.460
WE'RE STILL DEVELOPING OUR

01:36:06.527 --> 01:36:07.027
POLICIES AND THOUGHTS AROUND

01:36:07.094 --> 01:36:09.997
THIS. CERTAINLY WE IN THE SAME

01:36:10.064 --> 01:36:11.031
WAY, WE WOULDN'T WANT OUR

01:36:11.098 --> 01:36:12.867
STUDENTS TO USE SOCIAL MEDIA TO

01:36:12.933 --> 01:36:14.268
GET, YOU KNOW, COACHING ON

01:36:14.335 --> 01:36:15.870
DOING HARMFUL ACTIVITIES. WE

01:36:15.936 --> 01:36:18.339
WOULDN'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN ON

01:36:18.405 --> 01:36:20.107
CHATGPT EITHER, BUT IT'S A VERY

01:36:20.174 --> 01:36:21.909
SERIOUS ISSUE FOR US TO TEACH

01:36:21.976 --> 01:36:23.177
OUR STUDENTS ABOUT, BECAUSE

01:36:23.244 --> 01:36:24.912
MUCH OF WHAT THEY ACCESS IS

01:36:24.979 --> 01:36:26.380
ACTUALLY OUTSIDE OF THE CSU'S

01:36:26.447 --> 01:36:29.216
CONTROL. RIGHT. BUT YOU PUT

01:36:29.283 --> 01:36:31.285
THIS IN THEIR HANDS, WHICH I

01:36:31.352 --> 01:36:32.253
THINK IS WHY WE ARE THIS CLOSED

01:36:32.319 --> 01:36:34.021
SPACE. YEAH, WE PUT A CLOSED

01:36:34.088 --> 01:36:36.123
ONE IN OUR SPACE. YES. AND SO I

01:36:36.190 --> 01:36:38.159
WILL NOW DEVIATE FROM MY

01:36:38.225 --> 01:36:38.859
COLLEAGUE'S QUESTION AND SAY,

01:36:38.926 --> 01:36:41.228
YOU KNOW, AND I HAD THIS

01:36:41.295 --> 01:36:42.296
CONVERSATION EARLIER TODAY WITH

01:36:42.363 --> 01:36:45.266
OPENAI. SO IT IS WIDELY NOTED.

01:36:45.332 --> 01:36:47.501
AND I THINK THEY'VE BEEN

01:36:47.568 --> 01:36:48.335
TRANSPARENT ABOUT THIS, THAT

01:36:48.402 --> 01:36:51.839
GPT 4.0 WAS FRIENDLIER, WARMER,

01:36:51.906 --> 01:36:55.142
MORE SYCOPHANTIC THAN GPT FIVE.

01:36:55.209 --> 01:36:56.977
AND I WILL SAY, ONE OF MY

01:36:57.044 --> 01:36:58.012
CHILDREN REMARKED TO ME,

01:36:58.078 --> 01:37:00.114
ACTUALLY, A NOTED DIFFERENCE

01:37:00.181 --> 01:37:02.383
BETWEEN THE TWO MODELS. THAT

01:37:02.449 --> 01:37:05.186
WAS A CHOICE THAT OPENAI MADE.

01:37:05.252 --> 01:37:06.987
YOU KNOW, THERE'S ALSO BEEN

01:37:07.054 --> 01:37:08.255
REPORTS THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE

01:37:08.322 --> 01:37:09.924
IT WHEN IT WASN'T AS WARM AND

01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:11.225
NICE, AND SO THEY'VE DIALED IT

01:37:11.292 --> 01:37:13.127
SLIGHTLY BACK TOWARDS 4.0. SO

01:37:13.194 --> 01:37:14.461
THOSE ARE CHOICES THAT THE

01:37:14.528 --> 01:37:16.964
MODELS ARE MAKING. IS THERE

01:37:17.031 --> 01:37:19.900
ANYTHING IN YOUR CONTRACT THAT

01:37:19.967 --> 01:37:21.101
SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES

01:37:21.168 --> 01:37:24.939
SYCOPHANCY? NOT AT THIS TIME.

01:37:25.005 --> 01:37:26.273
WE DON'T WE DON'T ADDRESS THAT

01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:27.908
AT THIS TIME, BUT CERTAINLY AS

01:37:27.975 --> 01:37:29.977
THIS TECHNOLOGY ON YOUR LIST,

01:37:30.044 --> 01:37:31.645
BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT IF

01:37:31.712 --> 01:37:33.180
WE'RE PUTTING THIS IN THE HANDS

01:37:33.247 --> 01:37:34.148
OF STUDENTS FOR ACADEMIC

01:37:34.215 --> 01:37:35.316
PURPOSES, THE TOOL DOES NOT

01:37:35.382 --> 01:37:37.885
NEED TO BE SYCOPHANTIC. FRANKLY,

01:37:37.952 --> 01:37:39.520
I DON'T KNOW THAT IT NEEDS TO

01:37:39.587 --> 01:37:40.287
REMEMBER PERSONAL

01:37:40.354 --> 01:37:41.255
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE STUDENTS,

01:37:41.322 --> 01:37:42.923
WHICH IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:37:42.990 --> 01:37:44.225
PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO BELIEVE

01:37:44.291 --> 01:37:45.859
IS CAUSING SOME OF THE

01:37:45.926 --> 01:37:47.995
RELATIONAL ADDICTION. THOSE ARE

01:37:48.062 --> 01:37:49.263
THINGS THAT DO NOT HAVE TO BE

01:37:49.330 --> 01:37:51.465
IN THE MODEL AND ARE CHOICES

01:37:51.532 --> 01:37:53.467
THAT ARE MADE ON MODELS, AND WE

01:37:53.534 --> 01:37:54.768
HAVE THE RIGHT, I BELIEVE, IN

01:37:54.835 --> 01:37:56.103
THESE CONTRACTS TO DETERMINE

01:37:56.170 --> 01:37:57.171
THOSE THINGS. AND WE SHOULD BE

01:37:57.238 --> 01:37:59.206
AND SAFETY SHOULD BE PARAMOUNT,

01:37:59.273 --> 01:38:00.474
AND WE SHOULD BE MAKING THE

01:38:00.541 --> 01:38:01.442
SAFEST DECISIONS FOR OUR

01:38:01.508 --> 01:38:03.043
STUDENTS. AND NONE OF THAT

01:38:03.110 --> 01:38:04.979
WOULD DEPLETE THE ABILITY FOR

01:38:05.045 --> 01:38:07.081
THE ACADEMIC OUTCOMES THAT I

01:38:07.147 --> 01:38:08.415
THINK EVERYBODY AT THIS TABLE

01:38:08.482 --> 01:38:10.117
AND THIS DAIS WANTS. AND SO I

01:38:10.184 --> 01:38:12.286
WOULD ASK THE CSU'S TO LOOK AT

01:38:12.353 --> 01:38:13.821
THAT DIRECTLY AND COME BACK TO

01:38:13.887 --> 01:38:15.489
US IN SHORT ORDER, AND HOW

01:38:15.556 --> 01:38:17.157
YOU'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THAT.

01:38:17.224 --> 01:38:17.958
HER NEXT QUESTION IS, WILL

01:38:18.025 --> 01:38:19.460
STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES BE

01:38:19.526 --> 01:38:21.061
IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED IF A

01:38:21.128 --> 01:38:24.131
STUDENT IS IN THE EDU SYSTEM,

01:38:24.198 --> 01:38:26.467
IN YOUR CLOSED SYSTEM TALKING

01:38:26.533 --> 01:38:30.204
ABOUT SUICIDE? SO AND MY

01:38:30.271 --> 01:38:31.972
COLLEAGUE HERE ADDRESSED THE

01:38:32.039 --> 01:38:34.842
FACT THAT WE TREAT THE CSU

01:38:34.908 --> 01:38:35.976
INTERACTIONS ARE TOTALLY

01:38:36.043 --> 01:38:38.112
PRIVATE. SO WE TREAT IT JUST

01:38:38.178 --> 01:38:39.613
LIKE EMAIL. WE DON'T ACTUALLY

01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:40.948
SEE THOSE INTERACTIONS, JUST

01:38:41.015 --> 01:38:43.050
LIKE WE DON'T SEE YOUR EMAIL.

01:38:43.117 --> 01:38:45.019
AND SO THERE'S NOT REALLY A WAY

01:38:45.085 --> 01:38:48.122
FOR US TO JUST SAY, HEY, WE SAW

01:38:48.188 --> 01:38:48.989
THAT YOU'RE DOING THIS OR THAT

01:38:49.056 --> 01:38:51.225
OR THE OTHER UNTIL BECAUSE IT

01:38:51.292 --> 01:38:53.527
WOULD BE VIOLATING PEOPLE'S

01:38:53.594 --> 01:38:55.195
PRIVACY OTHERWISE. I WILL NOTE

01:38:55.262 --> 01:38:56.363
IF SOMEONE WALKED INTO YOUR

01:38:56.430 --> 01:38:57.965
HEALTH SYSTEM AND TOLD ONE OF

01:38:58.032 --> 01:38:58.966
YOUR PHYSICIANS THEY WERE

01:38:59.033 --> 01:39:00.100
THINKING ABOUT SUICIDE, THAT

01:39:00.167 --> 01:39:01.735
WOULD NOT BE COVERED BY DOCTOR

01:39:01.802 --> 01:39:04.004
PATIENT PRIVILEGE IF IT WAS A

01:39:04.071 --> 01:39:05.306
REALISTIC CONCERN OF THEIRS.

01:39:05.372 --> 01:39:06.907
THEY ARE A MANDATED REPORTER,

01:39:06.974 --> 01:39:09.076
AND SO THE PRIVACY WOULD NOT

01:39:09.143 --> 01:39:10.110
EXTEND TO DISCUSSIONS OF

01:39:10.177 --> 01:39:11.712
SUICIDE. AND THAT INSTANCE, AND

01:39:11.779 --> 01:39:12.313
I THINK YOU SHOULD RECONSIDER

01:39:12.379 --> 01:39:13.981
YOUR PRIVACY IN THIS INSTANCE

01:39:14.048 --> 01:39:17.318
AS WELL. SO ONE OF HER

01:39:17.384 --> 01:39:18.252
QUESTIONS HERE, WHICH I THINK

01:39:18.319 --> 01:39:19.953
IS AN INTERESTING ONE, IS HAS

01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:22.589
THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM

01:39:22.656 --> 01:39:24.858
CONSIDERED LIABILITY AS IT

01:39:24.925 --> 01:39:27.094
RELATES TO A STUDENT THAT USES

01:39:27.161 --> 01:39:28.228
THESE SYSTEMS TO HARM

01:39:28.295 --> 01:39:29.897
THEMSELVES OR TO CREATE

01:39:29.963 --> 01:39:34.134
NONCONSENSUAL PORNOGRAPHY? THIS

01:39:34.201 --> 01:39:37.137
IS A THIS IS A A QUESTION THAT

01:39:37.204 --> 01:39:38.906
WOULD BE BETTER SERVED BY OUR

01:39:38.972 --> 01:39:40.074
LEGAL TEAM THAT WORKED ON THE

01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:42.242
CONTRACT. I'M NOT AWARE OF THAT

01:39:42.309 --> 01:39:45.045
LEVEL OF DETAIL. OKAY. AS THE

01:39:45.112 --> 01:39:48.315
INDIVIDUALS THAT FUND YOU AND

01:39:48.382 --> 01:39:50.184
OVERSEE YOUR BUDGET, LIABILITY

01:39:50.250 --> 01:39:51.385
IS OBVIOUSLY A PIECE OF THAT,

01:39:51.452 --> 01:39:53.053
AND IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO US

01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:54.288
THAT YOU ARE PROTECTING

01:39:54.355 --> 01:39:55.556
YOURSELF FROM POTENTIAL

01:39:55.622 --> 01:39:56.123
LIABILITY IN THESE WAYS. SO,

01:39:56.190 --> 01:39:57.257
AGAIN, WOULD APPRECIATE YOU

01:39:57.324 --> 01:39:59.693
FOLLOWING UP ON THAT. AND YOUR

01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:04.098
COUNSEL CAN DO SO. THIS ONE

01:40:04.164 --> 01:40:05.699
AGAIN, MISS PELLERIN'S QUESTION,

01:40:05.766 --> 01:40:07.034
HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THE

01:40:07.101 --> 01:40:08.135
NUMEROUS STUDIES THAT HAVE COME

01:40:08.202 --> 01:40:09.336
OUT RECENTLY THAT SHOW THAT

01:40:09.403 --> 01:40:10.838
CHATGPT USE BY STUDENTS LEADS

01:40:10.904 --> 01:40:13.173
THEM TO GET TO GETTING, QUOTE,

01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:15.142
LAZIER OVER TIME? SPECIFICALLY,

01:40:15.209 --> 01:40:17.511
THE MIT STUDY THAT CAME OUT

01:40:17.578 --> 01:40:18.278
RECENTLY THAT FOUND THAT

01:40:18.345 --> 01:40:19.446
CHATGPT USERS HAD THE LOWEST

01:40:19.513 --> 01:40:21.081
BRAIN ENGAGEMENT AND I QUOTE,

01:40:21.148 --> 01:40:22.349
CONSISTENTLY UNDERPERFORMED AT

01:40:22.416 --> 01:40:23.784
NEUTRAL LINGUISTIC AND

01:40:23.851 --> 01:40:27.221
BEHAVIORAL LEVELS. SO WE'RE

01:40:27.287 --> 01:40:29.957
AWARE OF THE MIT STUDY AND

01:40:30.023 --> 01:40:32.126
OTHER STUDIES THAT ARE ALSO

01:40:32.192 --> 01:40:33.327
EITHER IN SUPPORT OR

01:40:33.394 --> 01:40:35.028
POTENTIALLY SHOWING OTHER

01:40:35.095 --> 01:40:37.931
STRATEGIES AROUND THAT. SO

01:40:37.998 --> 01:40:40.100
AGAIN, WE ARE ENCOURAGING OUR

01:40:40.167 --> 01:40:42.002
FACULTY AND OUR STUDENTS TO

01:40:42.069 --> 01:40:44.138
UTILIZE THE TOOL IF THEY IN

01:40:44.204 --> 01:40:46.340
ORDER TO PREPARE EITHER FOR THE

01:40:46.407 --> 01:40:49.042
WORKFORCE OR TO BE ABLE TO

01:40:49.109 --> 01:40:51.078
STILL USE OUR CRITICAL THINKING

01:40:51.145 --> 01:40:52.980
SKILLS, FOR EXAMPLE, IN THEIR

01:40:53.046 --> 01:40:54.915
PROMPT EXERCISES AND OTHER WAYS

01:40:54.982 --> 01:40:57.017
THAT REQUIRE CRITICAL THINKING.

01:40:57.084 --> 01:40:58.318
SO WE'RE HOPING THAT IT'S NOT

01:40:58.385 --> 01:40:59.887
ENCOURAGING LAZY THINKING, BUT

01:40:59.953 --> 01:41:01.221
THAT THE STUDENTS ARE ACTUALLY

01:41:01.288 --> 01:41:02.790
LEARNING DIFFERENT STRATEGIES

01:41:02.856 --> 01:41:05.058
AROUND HOW TO USE AI TO SUPPORT

01:41:05.125 --> 01:41:07.127
THEIR LEARNING AND TEACHING

01:41:07.194 --> 01:41:08.162
ENVIRONMENT OR THE LEARNING

01:41:08.228 --> 01:41:09.930
ENVIRONMENT. I APPRECIATE THAT,

01:41:09.997 --> 01:41:11.398
AND I'LL SAY, SPEAKING FOR

01:41:11.465 --> 01:41:13.033
MYSELF NOW, I ACTUALLY REALLY

01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:15.169
APPRECIATED THE MANY, BOTH IN

01:41:15.235 --> 01:41:17.538
THE REPORT I CITED EARLIER AND

01:41:17.604 --> 01:41:18.138
IN THE FINAL REPORT, YOU PUT

01:41:18.205 --> 01:41:20.107
OUT THE DISCUSSION AROUND

01:41:20.174 --> 01:41:21.542
LITERACY THAT COMES WITH THIS.

01:41:21.608 --> 01:41:22.810
I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.

01:41:22.876 --> 01:41:24.178
YOU KNOW, WE KNOW AND IT'S NO

01:41:24.244 --> 01:41:26.447
SECRET THAT THESE TOOLS AREN'T

01:41:26.513 --> 01:41:28.282
ALWAYS 100% ACCURATE AND THAT

01:41:28.348 --> 01:41:30.150
IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR

01:41:30.217 --> 01:41:31.385
STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO CHECK

01:41:31.452 --> 01:41:32.152
THE PRIMARY SOURCES TO MAKE

01:41:32.219 --> 01:41:34.188
SURE THEY'RE GETTING THE RIGHT

01:41:34.254 --> 01:41:35.956
INFORMATION. I HAVE A I'M A

01:41:36.023 --> 01:41:37.391
FORMER PRACTICING ATTORNEY. I

01:41:37.458 --> 01:41:38.926
HAVE AN OLD COLLEAGUE WHO IS

01:41:38.992 --> 01:41:40.093
CONSTANTLY TESTING CHATGPT ON

01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:42.229
IT'S LEGAL AND ALWAYS PUTTING

01:41:42.296 --> 01:41:44.198
OUT THESE FUNNY STORIES OF ALL

01:41:44.264 --> 01:41:45.999
THE WRONG ADVICE IT GIVES. AND

01:41:46.066 --> 01:41:48.635
THAT'S NOT, YOU KNOW, I MEAN,

01:41:48.702 --> 01:41:49.937
THESE TOOLS ARE NOT PERFECT.

01:41:50.003 --> 01:41:52.105
AND SO I DO THINK THE LITERACY

01:41:52.172 --> 01:41:52.940
PIECE IS REALLY CRITICAL. AND

01:41:53.006 --> 01:41:55.542
WE FUNDED A ACTIVITY WITH THE

01:41:55.609 --> 01:41:57.244
LIBRARIES OR LIBRARIES OR HAVE

01:41:57.311 --> 01:41:58.979
ENTERED INTO AN AI LITERACY

01:41:59.046 --> 01:42:01.148
RESEARCH PROJECT AROUND THAT.

01:42:01.215 --> 01:42:02.149
AND SO HAVE OUR CENTERS FOR

01:42:02.216 --> 01:42:03.283
TEACHING AND LEARNING, SEVERAL

01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:05.786
OF THEM AS WELL AROUND AI

01:42:05.853 --> 01:42:06.987
LITERACY. YEAH. OKAY. SO THEN

01:42:07.054 --> 01:42:09.156
AND I DON'T I'M NOT AWARE OF

01:42:09.223 --> 01:42:11.792
THIS, BUT THIS MAY BE A

01:42:11.859 --> 01:42:13.026
QUESTION FOR YOU. IN JULY, A

01:42:13.093 --> 01:42:14.194
FEDERAL JUDGE ORDERED THE

01:42:14.261 --> 01:42:15.796
CHATGPT PRESERVE. NEARLY EVERY

01:42:15.863 --> 01:42:17.498
EXCHANGE ITS USERS HAVE HAD

01:42:17.564 --> 01:42:19.166
WITH THE CHATBOT. IS THAT

01:42:19.233 --> 01:42:20.367
SOMETHING YOU'RE AWARE OF? OKAY,

01:42:20.434 --> 01:42:21.902
YOU'RE BOTH AWARE OF THAT. SO

01:42:21.969 --> 01:42:23.537
HOW ARE YOU KEEPING THIS DATA

01:42:23.604 --> 01:42:25.372
PRIVATE WHILE ALSO COMPLYING

01:42:25.439 --> 01:42:27.508
WITH THAT COURT ORDER? BECAUSE

01:42:27.574 --> 01:42:29.843
BECAUSE WE DO HAVE OUR PRIVATE

01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:31.979
INSTANCE. WE WEREN'T SUBJECT TO

01:42:32.045 --> 01:42:33.313
THAT SUBPOENA OKAY. SO THAT'S

01:42:33.380 --> 01:42:36.049
SEPARATE. OKAY. AND THEN, YOU

01:42:36.116 --> 01:42:38.118
KNOW, AS WAS MENTIONED BY OUR

01:42:38.185 --> 01:42:40.320
COLLEAGUE CHATGPT IS A CLOSED

01:42:40.387 --> 01:42:42.256
SOURCE MODEL. DOES THE CSU KNOW

01:42:42.322 --> 01:42:44.491
THE MODEL WEIGHTS, THE EMBEDDED

01:42:44.558 --> 01:42:47.127
IN THE CODE, LIKE HOW MUCH YOU

01:42:47.194 --> 01:42:49.663
DON'T HAVE ANY. WE DON'T WE

01:42:49.730 --> 01:42:52.165
DON'T. OKAY. AND YOU ALREADY

01:42:52.232 --> 01:42:54.034
ANSWERED THAT QUESTION. AND I

01:42:54.101 --> 01:42:56.103
WILL SAY, AS SOMEONE WHO IS A

01:42:56.169 --> 01:42:57.471
LITTLE BIT OF AN INTELLECTUAL

01:42:57.538 --> 01:43:00.140
PROPERTY NERD, I DO I DO

01:43:00.207 --> 01:43:01.909
APPRECIATE THE EFFORT THAT IS

01:43:01.975 --> 01:43:03.076
GOING INTO PROTECTING THE

01:43:03.143 --> 01:43:04.578
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AT YOUR

01:43:04.645 --> 01:43:05.913
UNIVERSITIES. AND I THINK ONE

01:43:05.979 --> 01:43:07.180
OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK IS

01:43:07.247 --> 01:43:09.182
REALLY EXCITING ABOUT THIS,

01:43:09.249 --> 01:43:10.017
FRANKLY, IS WE DON'T PAY ENOUGH

01:43:10.083 --> 01:43:12.019
ATTENTION HERE IN THE STATE TO

01:43:12.085 --> 01:43:13.587
THE WAY WE CAN IMPACT POLICY

01:43:13.654 --> 01:43:15.222
THROUGH OUR PURCHASING POWER.

01:43:15.289 --> 01:43:16.990
IT'S REAL. AND, YOU KNOW, WE

01:43:17.057 --> 01:43:20.928
ARE. I WOULD GUESS, ONE OF THE

01:43:20.994 --> 01:43:22.262
LARGEST PURCHASERS IN THE STATE

01:43:22.329 --> 01:43:24.965
OF MANY, MANY THINGS, THE STATE

01:43:25.032 --> 01:43:27.434
ITSELF. AND SO, YOU KNOW,

01:43:27.501 --> 01:43:27.868
MAKING THOSE KIND OF

01:43:27.935 --> 01:43:29.169
REQUIREMENTS ON A CONTRACT, I

01:43:29.236 --> 01:43:31.505
THINK CHANGES THE GAME AND IT

01:43:31.572 --> 01:43:32.372
EMPOWERS OTHERS TO DO THE SAME.

01:43:32.439 --> 01:43:34.141
AND SO I THINK THAT'S REALLY

01:43:34.207 --> 01:43:35.275
POWERFUL. AND I THINK YOU'VE

01:43:35.342 --> 01:43:36.810
DONE A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT

01:43:36.877 --> 01:43:37.945
WE'VE HEARD TODAY IN THE

01:43:38.011 --> 01:43:39.179
CONTRACT THAT ARE NOVEL AND

01:43:39.246 --> 01:43:40.681
INTERESTING, AND I THINK WILL

01:43:40.747 --> 01:43:42.015
HOPEFULLY BE A WAY FOR OTHERS

01:43:42.082 --> 01:43:44.051
TO FOLLOW IN CHANGING THE WAY

01:43:44.117 --> 01:43:45.152
WE PURCHASE THESE TOOLS,

01:43:45.218 --> 01:43:45.953
ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO

01:43:46.019 --> 01:43:46.853
GOVERNMENT SPECIFICALLY,

01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:48.121
BECAUSE I DO THINK WE HAVE A

01:43:48.188 --> 01:43:49.389
DIFFERENT OBLIGATION WITH DATA

01:43:49.456 --> 01:43:52.392
THAN PRIVATE SECTOR PURCHASERS.

01:43:52.459 --> 01:43:54.995
SO I THINK, FRANKLY, SHE ASKED

01:43:55.062 --> 01:43:57.698
A LOT OF MY QUESTIONS, WHICH

01:43:57.764 --> 01:43:59.900
WAS GREAT. ONE THING THAT I

01:43:59.967 --> 01:44:08.108
THINK. I GUESS THE PRIVACY

01:44:08.175 --> 01:44:09.142
THING IS, I THINK YOU'VE BEEN

01:44:09.209 --> 01:44:11.445
PRETTY CLEAR ABOUT IT, THAT

01:44:11.511 --> 01:44:12.212
IT'S ALL PRIVATE, IT'S ALL

01:44:12.279 --> 01:44:13.947
SEPARATE. IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY

01:44:14.014 --> 01:44:15.515
DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO ANY OF THE

01:44:15.582 --> 01:44:17.718
STUDENT DATA. THAT WAS MY

01:44:17.784 --> 01:44:18.318
UNDERSTANDING, RIGHT? THAT WAS

01:44:18.385 --> 01:44:22.556
WHAT WAS SAID. AND. SO AND

01:44:22.623 --> 01:44:24.291
YOU'RE NOT MONITORING ANY OF

01:44:24.358 --> 01:44:26.193
THE ACTIVITY OF STAFF OR

01:44:26.259 --> 01:44:27.394
FACULTY. WHAT IF THERE IS AN

01:44:27.461 --> 01:44:29.329
ACCUSATION OF PLAGIARISM OR

01:44:29.396 --> 01:44:30.897
SOME MISUSE OF THE TOOL? CAN

01:44:30.964 --> 01:44:33.133
YOU ACCESS IT AT THAT POINT? OH

01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:36.236
NO. NO. IT'S ALWAYS PRIVATE. NO.

01:44:36.303 --> 01:44:40.273
FASCINATING. OKAY. AND THEN,

01:44:40.340 --> 01:44:42.109
YOU KNOW, IN OTHER MOMENTS

01:44:42.175 --> 01:44:43.243
WHERE THE GOVERNMENT IS ENGAGED

01:44:43.310 --> 01:44:45.412
IN AI IN THIS WAY, WE'VE WE'VE

01:44:45.479 --> 01:44:48.815
USED A SANDBOX APPROACH. AND,

01:44:48.882 --> 01:44:50.951
YOU KNOW, WHERE IT'S CONTROLLED

01:44:51.018 --> 01:44:52.285
AND LIMITED HERE. YOU SORT OF

01:44:52.352 --> 01:44:54.054
JUST PUT IT OUT INTO THE, INTO

01:44:54.121 --> 01:44:56.523
THE CSU SYSTEM. WITH NEARLY

01:44:56.590 --> 01:44:57.391
HALF A MILLION STUDENTS OPTING

01:44:57.457 --> 01:45:01.094
IN, I GUESS. AND I'M HEARING A

01:45:01.161 --> 01:45:02.362
LITTLE BIT OF, YOU KNOW, YOUR

01:45:02.429 --> 01:45:03.096
PRESENTATIONS ARE GREAT. THE

01:45:03.163 --> 01:45:04.331
MINUTE WE GOT INTO QUESTIONS,

01:45:04.398 --> 01:45:06.166
IT FELT LIKE MAYBE ENOUGH

01:45:06.233 --> 01:45:07.000
THOUGHT HADN'T GONE INTO SOME

01:45:07.067 --> 01:45:08.335
OF THESE POLICIES, FRANKLY,

01:45:08.402 --> 01:45:10.170
THAT I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO

01:45:10.237 --> 01:45:11.071
FOLLOW UP ON. WHY DID YOU

01:45:11.138 --> 01:45:13.440
CHOOSE NOT TO PILOT IT? WHY DID

01:45:13.507 --> 01:45:15.308
YOU CHOOSE TO GO ALL IN AT ONCE?

01:45:15.375 --> 01:45:16.943
WELL, I'LL TRY AND I INVITE MY

01:45:17.010 --> 01:45:18.178
COLLEAGUES TO ALSO JUMP IN. YOU

01:45:18.245 --> 01:45:20.313
KNOW, THE CSU WAS NOT EVEN

01:45:20.380 --> 01:45:21.915
CLOSE TO BEING THE FIRST TO

01:45:21.982 --> 01:45:24.451
ADOPT THESE TOOLS. YOU SEE,

01:45:24.518 --> 01:45:25.152
LARGE UNIVERSITIES MICHIGAN,

01:45:25.218 --> 01:45:28.055
HARVARD, FLORIDA, ARIZONA STATE

01:45:28.121 --> 01:45:29.890
HAVE ADOPTED THESE TOOLS. AND

01:45:29.956 --> 01:45:31.124
WHAT WE WERE MOST CONCERNED

01:45:31.191 --> 01:45:33.026
ABOUT IS THAT WE WOULD BE

01:45:33.093 --> 01:45:34.361
CAUSING A DIGITAL DIVIDE WITH

01:45:34.428 --> 01:45:35.929
OUR CSU ACCESS INSTITUTIONS

01:45:35.996 --> 01:45:38.265
VERSUS THESE VERY LARGE, BETTER

01:45:38.331 --> 01:45:42.335
FUNDED R-1S. AND SO OUR THOUGHT

01:45:42.402 --> 01:45:43.970
WAS LIKE, OUR STUDENTS SHOULD

01:45:44.037 --> 01:45:45.172
NOT BE LEFT BEHIND. THEY CANNOT

01:45:45.238 --> 01:45:47.374
BE LEFT BEHIND AS THIS ECONOMY

01:45:47.441 --> 01:45:49.009
AND THIS WORKFORCE EVOLVES. AND

01:45:49.076 --> 01:45:51.812
THAT'S WHY WE DECIDED TO MOVE

01:45:51.878 --> 01:45:53.046
FORWARD MUCH AS THESE OTHER

01:45:53.113 --> 01:45:55.615
UNIVERSITIES DID. BUT THE

01:45:55.682 --> 01:45:58.251
CAMPUSES WERE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT

01:45:58.318 --> 01:46:00.220
IN THEIR OWN TIMELINES, SO SOME

01:46:00.287 --> 01:46:03.056
WERE MORE WERE ABLE TO MOVE

01:46:03.123 --> 01:46:04.224
FORWARD FASTER THAN OTHERS.

01:46:04.291 --> 01:46:06.126
OTHERS TOOK A MORE CAUTIONARY

01:46:06.193 --> 01:46:09.863
APPROACH. IF I COULD JUST ADD

01:46:09.930 --> 01:46:11.198
IN A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT YOUR

01:46:11.264 --> 01:46:13.667
QUESTION ABOUT THE AI POLICY,

01:46:13.734 --> 01:46:16.002
AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT AT

01:46:16.069 --> 01:46:18.772
OUR CAMPUS, WE DID TALK A LOT

01:46:18.839 --> 01:46:20.273
ABOUT AI POLICY, AND THERE

01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:21.208
WASN'T A GENERAL AGREEMENT

01:46:21.274 --> 01:46:22.976
ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY THAT AI

01:46:23.043 --> 01:46:25.112
POLICY SHOULD LOOK LIKE. THAT

01:46:25.178 --> 01:46:27.147
WOULD BE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL

01:46:27.214 --> 01:46:28.281
FOR THE ENTIRE UNIVERSITY. BUT

01:46:28.348 --> 01:46:31.084
WHAT WE DO OFFER OUR FACULTY IS

01:46:31.151 --> 01:46:32.986
SOMETHING WE DEVELOPED AS AN AI

01:46:33.053 --> 01:46:35.122
POLICY BUILDER THAT EACH

01:46:35.188 --> 01:46:37.023
FACULTY CAN USE IF THEY WISH TO

01:46:37.090 --> 01:46:40.293
CREATE CLEAR USAGE GUIDELINES,

01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:42.195
GUIDELINES ABOUT WHAT

01:46:42.262 --> 01:46:44.064
CONSTITUTES REASONABLE USE IN A

01:46:44.131 --> 01:46:46.900
COURSE FOR STUDENTS FOR USE OF

01:46:46.967 --> 01:46:49.236
AI. SO THAT BECAUSE IT'S VERY

01:46:49.302 --> 01:46:50.971
DIFFERENT HOW YOU MIGHT USE AI

01:46:51.037 --> 01:46:53.140
IN AN ENGLISH COURSE VERSUS A

01:46:53.206 --> 01:46:54.474
MATH COURSE VERSUS ANOTHER

01:46:54.541 --> 01:46:57.377
COURSE. SO I JUST WANTED TO

01:46:57.444 --> 01:46:58.211
MENTION THAT AS WELL, THAT I

01:46:58.278 --> 01:46:59.880
THINK THAT THERE'S STILL SOME

01:46:59.946 --> 01:47:01.014
THOUGHTS DEVELOPING AROUND AI

01:47:01.081 --> 01:47:03.183
POLICIES AND WHAT MAKES SENSE

01:47:03.250 --> 01:47:05.685
AS A CAMPUS BASED APPROACH. AND

01:47:05.752 --> 01:47:07.854
AND SO IN THE IN THE MEANTIME,

01:47:07.921 --> 01:47:09.055
THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS

01:47:09.122 --> 01:47:10.290
THAT WE'RE DOING NOW, I

01:47:10.357 --> 01:47:12.058
APPRECIATE THAT. I'LL SAY THAT

01:47:12.125 --> 01:47:13.493
MY I AGED OUT OF MY CHILDREN'S

01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:15.529
MATH MANY YEARS AGO, AND THAT

01:47:15.595 --> 01:47:16.396
HAS BEEN CHALLENGING IN MY

01:47:16.463 --> 01:47:17.964
HOUSEHOLD. I'M A MORE LIBERAL

01:47:18.031 --> 01:47:20.834
ARTS PERSON. AND RECENTLY MY

01:47:20.901 --> 01:47:25.372
DAUGHTER WAS ASKING CHATGPT NOT

01:47:25.438 --> 01:47:26.907
TO DO HER PROBLEM, BUT TO TEACH

01:47:26.973 --> 01:47:29.142
HER. AND IT WAS LIKE STEP BY

01:47:29.209 --> 01:47:30.977
STEP, HOW DO YOU DO THIS? AND

01:47:31.044 --> 01:47:32.445
GAVE IT DIFFERENT NUMBERS SO

01:47:32.512 --> 01:47:34.047
THAT YOU COULD THEN DO HER

01:47:34.114 --> 01:47:35.248
PROBLEM. AND IT WAS SUPER

01:47:35.315 --> 01:47:36.183
HELPFUL TO OUR FAMILY. NOW, I

01:47:36.249 --> 01:47:37.984
DID THEN USE A CALCULATOR TO

01:47:38.051 --> 01:47:39.352
MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS RIGHT.

01:47:39.419 --> 01:47:41.154
BUT BUT I DO THINK IN THAT

01:47:41.221 --> 01:47:42.289
CONTEXT SHE WAS ACTUALLY USING

01:47:42.355 --> 01:47:44.257
IT AS A LEARNING TOOL, RIGHT?

01:47:44.324 --> 01:47:45.258
NOT A CHEATING TOOL. AND THAT'S

01:47:45.325 --> 01:47:46.393
IT'S AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION.

01:47:46.459 --> 01:47:47.894
AND OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE MUCH

01:47:47.961 --> 01:47:48.995
MORE SOPHISTICATED IN THEIR USE

01:47:49.062 --> 01:47:51.464
THAN WE ARE, AND I THINK CAN

01:47:51.531 --> 01:47:53.200
USE IT IN WAYS THAT HELPS THEM

01:47:53.266 --> 01:47:54.267
WITHOUT SUPPLANTING LEARNING,

01:47:54.334 --> 01:47:56.069
WHICH CAN BE REALLY GREAT. SO

01:47:56.136 --> 01:47:59.239
MY LAST QUESTION IS HOW WILL WE

01:47:59.306 --> 01:48:01.174
KNOW IF THIS IS A SUCCESS? YOU

01:48:01.241 --> 01:48:05.011
KNOW, ARE THERE METRICS? ARE WE

01:48:05.078 --> 01:48:06.313
WATCHING? ARE WE LEARNING FROM

01:48:06.379 --> 01:48:08.081
IT? ARE WE GOING TO I HEAR A

01:48:08.148 --> 01:48:10.550
LOT OF WE'RE GOING TO ITERATE

01:48:10.617 --> 01:48:12.018
ON THIS, BUT WHAT ARE THE

01:48:12.085 --> 01:48:13.053
METRICS TO DECIDE IF WHAT WE'VE

01:48:13.119 --> 01:48:14.888
DONE IS THE RIGHT MOVE FOR THE

01:48:14.955 --> 01:48:16.590
CSU STUDENTS? YOU ARE REFERRING

01:48:16.656 --> 01:48:18.458
DIRECTLY TO THE METRICS EFFORT

01:48:18.525 --> 01:48:20.126
THAT IS UNDERWAY. RIGHT NOW.

01:48:20.193 --> 01:48:20.861
WE'RE COLLECTING METRICS FROM,

01:48:20.927 --> 01:48:23.663
I BELIEVE IT'S NINE DIFFERENT

01:48:23.730 --> 01:48:26.132
LENSES, RANGING FROM ADOPTION

01:48:26.199 --> 01:48:28.735
TO WORKFORCE EMPLOYMENT

01:48:28.802 --> 01:48:31.004
OUTCOMES TO EVEN, YOU KNOW,

01:48:31.071 --> 01:48:32.105
WE'RE ACTUALLY ASKING ON

01:48:32.172 --> 01:48:34.908
ACADEMIC OUTCOMES AS WELL,

01:48:34.975 --> 01:48:36.076
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. THOSE ARE

01:48:36.142 --> 01:48:38.178
ALL LENSES THAT ARE PART OF OUR

01:48:38.245 --> 01:48:39.012
EFFORT IN THIS METRIC SPACE. WE

01:48:39.079 --> 01:48:41.648
WANT TO MEASURE HOW WE'RE DOING.

01:48:41.715 --> 01:48:42.983
WE WANT TO KNOW THE GOOD AND

01:48:43.049 --> 01:48:45.418
THE BAD, AND WE WANT TO TRACK

01:48:45.485 --> 01:48:46.219
THAT OVER TIME SO WE CAN

01:48:46.286 --> 01:48:48.321
IMPROVE. AND AS YOU POINTED OUT,

01:48:48.388 --> 01:48:50.090
YOU KNOW, WE UNDERSTAND ALL

01:48:50.156 --> 01:48:51.391
THESE CRITICISMS AND CONCERNS

01:48:51.458 --> 01:48:53.059
AND THEY'RE VALID. THEY'RE

01:48:53.126 --> 01:48:55.128
VALID CONCERNS. AND THE BEST

01:48:55.195 --> 01:48:56.396
WAY TO DEAL WITH THOSE CONCERNS

01:48:56.463 --> 01:48:57.964
IS TO HAVE OUR UNIVERSITIES

01:48:58.031 --> 01:48:59.566
PARTICIPATE IN HELPING TO SHAPE

01:48:59.633 --> 01:49:00.300
THE FUTURE OF THESE

01:49:00.367 --> 01:49:02.369
TECHNOLOGIES. WE CAN'T JUST SIT

01:49:02.435 --> 01:49:04.804
BACK AND LET IT GO BY. WE

01:49:04.871 --> 01:49:07.340
SHOULD HELP SHAPE THE FUTURE.

01:49:07.407 --> 01:49:08.909
AND I KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:49:08.975 --> 01:49:10.977
HEAR THIS IN THE NEXT PANEL.

01:49:11.044 --> 01:49:12.178
BUT I DID HAVE ONE MORE

01:49:12.245 --> 01:49:13.246
QUESTION BEFORE THEY COME,

01:49:13.313 --> 01:49:14.848
BECAUSE YOU WILL ALL HAVE LEFT

01:49:14.915 --> 01:49:17.150
US. I AM A BIG BELIEVER IN THE

01:49:17.217 --> 01:49:18.852
PATH FORWARD IN CALIFORNIA, AND

01:49:18.919 --> 01:49:20.353
I SAID THIS IN MY OPENING

01:49:20.420 --> 01:49:21.187
REMARKS IS STUDENTS AND

01:49:21.254 --> 01:49:23.523
TEACHERS AND WORKERS AT THE

01:49:23.590 --> 01:49:24.157
TABLE. I THINK THAT THAT IS SO

01:49:24.224 --> 01:49:25.825
CRITICAL TO DOING THIS RIGHT

01:49:25.892 --> 01:49:27.360
AND DOING IT IN A WAY THAT

01:49:27.427 --> 01:49:29.129
MOVES US FORWARD RATHER THAN

01:49:29.195 --> 01:49:30.263
LEAVES US BEHIND. YOU MENTIONED

01:49:30.330 --> 01:49:32.165
THEY WERE PART OF THESE WORKING

01:49:32.232 --> 01:49:34.367
GROUPS. I APPRECIATE THAT. I

01:49:34.434 --> 01:49:35.302
WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT

01:49:35.368 --> 01:49:37.671
TOKENIZING THAT. CAN YOU TALK

01:49:37.737 --> 01:49:38.538
ABOUT HOW YOU'RE MAKING SURE

01:49:38.605 --> 01:49:39.606
THAT THEIR INPUT IS REALLY

01:49:39.673 --> 01:49:41.908
MEANINGFUL? WELL, THEY SO THE

01:49:41.975 --> 01:49:44.177
WORKING GROUPS, THE MAIN SYSTEM

01:49:44.244 --> 01:49:45.178
WIDE WORKING GROUP HAS

01:49:45.245 --> 01:49:46.446
MEMBERSHIP FROM ALL THOSE AREAS

01:49:46.513 --> 01:49:48.181
THAT YOU MENTIONED, FACULTY,

01:49:48.248 --> 01:49:50.317
STAFF AND STUDENTS. AND THEY

01:49:50.383 --> 01:49:52.185
ARE JUST AS MUCH A THEIR INPUT

01:49:52.252 --> 01:49:55.288
IS JUST AS MUCH VALUED AND AND

01:49:55.355 --> 01:49:57.023
UTILIZED AS ANYBODY ELSE IN

01:49:57.090 --> 01:49:58.191
THAT GROUP. IN FACT, THEIR

01:49:58.258 --> 01:49:59.059
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE THE REPORT

01:49:59.125 --> 01:50:01.461
THAT YOU SAW OR YOU'VE READ.

01:50:01.528 --> 01:50:03.363
AND THEN WE CONTINUE THAT THAT

01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:05.198
COMMITTEE HAS RECONVENED, AND

01:50:05.265 --> 01:50:07.067
WE'VE ACTUALLY ADDED MORE

01:50:07.133 --> 01:50:09.436
STUDENTS AND FACULTY AND AS AS

01:50:09.502 --> 01:50:12.172
MANY AS POSSIBLE, AS MANY WHO

01:50:12.238 --> 01:50:13.006
ARE INTERESTED, WHO HAVE

01:50:13.073 --> 01:50:15.175
STEPPED UP AND ASKED TO BE PART

01:50:15.241 --> 01:50:17.777
OF IT AS WELL. SO WE'RE HOPING

01:50:17.844 --> 01:50:19.212
TO HEAR, EVEN FROM NEW VOICES

01:50:19.279 --> 01:50:21.915
OR A LARGER VARIETY OF VOICES.

01:50:21.982 --> 01:50:24.050
GREAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. TURN

01:50:24.117 --> 01:50:25.285
IT BACK OVER TO THE CHAIR.

01:50:25.352 --> 01:50:26.953
THANK YOU SO MUCH, MADAM CHAIR,

01:50:27.020 --> 01:50:29.189
AND THANK YOU TO EVERYONE FOR

01:50:29.255 --> 01:50:30.423
YOUR COMMENTS ON THIS. JUST TO

01:50:30.490 --> 01:50:32.092
ECHO THE NUMBER OF COMMENTS

01:50:32.158 --> 01:50:33.093
AROUND UNIFORM TRAINING,

01:50:33.159 --> 01:50:34.294
SYSTEMWIDE TRAINING, I THINK

01:50:34.361 --> 01:50:35.562
THOSE ARE OPPORTUNITIES GOING

01:50:35.628 --> 01:50:36.029
FORWARD THAT WE SHOULD

01:50:36.096 --> 01:50:38.098
DEFINITELY LOOK AT AND LOOK

01:50:38.164 --> 01:50:39.899
FORWARD TO REPORT BACK ON THAT.

01:50:39.966 --> 01:50:41.067
ONE FINAL QUESTION I HAD ON

01:50:41.134 --> 01:50:43.136
THIS, AND THIS IS TOUCHED UPON

01:50:43.203 --> 01:50:44.004
THIS EARLIER, BUT THE RECENT

01:50:44.070 --> 01:50:46.072
MOU BETWEEN THE CSU AND THE

01:50:46.139 --> 01:50:47.841
GOVERNOR CALLS ON THE AI

01:50:47.907 --> 01:50:48.942
WORKFORCE ACCELERATION BOARD TO

01:50:49.009 --> 01:50:50.543
ADVANCE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT

01:50:50.610 --> 01:50:52.145
INITIATIVES THAT ALIGN TO CSU'S

01:50:52.212 --> 01:50:55.348
ADMISSIONS OF EQUITABLE ACCESS,

01:50:55.415 --> 01:50:56.216
ECONOMIC MOBILITY AND AI

01:50:56.282 --> 01:50:57.917
RELATED OPPORTUNITIES. YOU

01:50:57.984 --> 01:50:59.419
TOUCHED UPON A NUMBER OF THE

01:50:59.486 --> 01:51:00.353
THINGS YOU SAID INTERNSHIPS AND

01:51:00.420 --> 01:51:02.389
OTHER AREAS, BUT ARE THERE ANY

01:51:02.455 --> 01:51:03.990
ADDITIONAL INITIATIVES THAT ARE

01:51:04.057 --> 01:51:06.426
IN DEVELOPMENT ON THIS SPACE?

01:51:06.493 --> 01:51:09.095
SOME OF THE THINGS THE

01:51:09.162 --> 01:51:10.230
WORKFORCE BOARD IS, YOU KNOW,

01:51:10.296 --> 01:51:11.197
JUST VOLUNTARY MEMBERS THAT

01:51:11.264 --> 01:51:13.066
HAVE COME TOGETHER TO HELP

01:51:13.133 --> 01:51:14.934
SHAPE HOW WE MIGHT DO STUDENT

01:51:15.001 --> 01:51:18.371
PREP IN THIS RAPIDLY EVOLVING

01:51:18.438 --> 01:51:19.873
WORKFORCE SETTING. SO SOME OF

01:51:19.939 --> 01:51:22.008
THE THINGS THAT THE MEMBERS

01:51:22.075 --> 01:51:23.109
HAVE TALKED ABOUT IS, FOR

01:51:23.176 --> 01:51:24.811
EXAMPLE, CREATING SOME SORT OF

01:51:24.878 --> 01:51:26.446
INDEX, WORKFORCE READINESS

01:51:26.513 --> 01:51:29.215
INDEX, WHERE STUDENTS CAN

01:51:29.282 --> 01:51:30.383
DEMONSTRATE THEY HAVE THE

01:51:30.450 --> 01:51:32.819
SKILLS LIKE CREATIVITY AND

01:51:32.886 --> 01:51:35.188
COLLABORATION AND COMMUNICATION

01:51:35.255 --> 01:51:36.289
IN CONNECTION WITH THESE

01:51:36.356 --> 01:51:37.891
TECHNICAL SKILLS. THEY'RE GOING

01:51:37.957 --> 01:51:39.125
TO BE GOING TO BE IMPORTANT

01:51:39.192 --> 01:51:41.161
WITH USING THESE TOOLS AND ALSO

CONTRACT WITH OPENAI AND THE

01:59:18.618 --> 01:59:19.552
DEVELOPMENT OF THE CSU

01:59:19.619 --> 01:59:20.319
WORKFORCE ACCELERATION BOARD

01:59:20.386 --> 01:59:23.289
DID COME AS A SURPRISE. THERE

01:59:23.356 --> 01:59:25.057
ARE A NUMBER OF LESSONS THAT WE

01:59:25.124 --> 01:59:27.093
COULD LEARN FROM THE

01:59:27.159 --> 01:59:27.693
COMMUNICATIONS SURROUNDING THE

01:59:27.760 --> 01:59:28.961
ROLLOUT, AND THE APPARENT

01:59:29.028 --> 01:59:31.130
ENDORSEMENT OF AI TO OUR

01:59:31.197 --> 01:59:32.698
STUDENTS THROUGH THE AGREEMENT

01:59:32.765 --> 01:59:34.000
AND ISSUANCE OF LICENSE,

01:59:34.066 --> 01:59:35.201
WITHOUT ENSURING ALL FACULTY

01:59:35.268 --> 01:59:37.036
WERE TRAINED. SO I THINK THAT

01:59:37.103 --> 01:59:38.237
THESE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN

01:59:38.304 --> 01:59:40.740
BROUGHT UP WITH SOME OF THE

01:59:40.806 --> 01:59:43.976
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PILOT. AND

01:59:44.043 --> 01:59:46.112
IN STEP WITH THAT ANNOUNCEMENT,

01:59:46.178 --> 01:59:48.180
THOUGH, THE ASU WAS INVITED TO

01:59:48.247 --> 01:59:50.349
PLAY SENATORS ON A REFRESHED

01:59:50.416 --> 01:59:53.019
GENERAL GENERATIVE AI COMMITTEE,

01:59:53.085 --> 01:59:54.420
OF WHICH WE HAVE APPOINTED

01:59:54.487 --> 01:59:58.691
SEVERAL FACULTY TO EACH. I ALSO

01:59:58.758 --> 01:59:59.992
SERVE ALONGSIDE ANOTHER SENATOR

02:00:00.059 --> 02:00:01.193
ON THE WORKFORCE ACCELERATION

02:00:01.260 --> 02:00:03.896
BOARD, AND EACH OF THESE

02:00:03.963 --> 02:00:06.365
COMMITTEES HAVE SEVERAL

02:00:06.432 --> 02:00:07.366
SUBGROUPS, OR WORKING GROUPS

02:00:07.433 --> 02:00:08.868
THAT RANGE FROM TEACHING AND

02:00:08.935 --> 02:00:11.637
LEARNING TO PROCUREMENT AND

02:00:11.704 --> 02:00:13.906
PURCHASING. IN MY ROLE ON THE

02:00:13.973 --> 02:00:15.441
WORKFORCE ACCELERATION BOARD,

02:00:15.508 --> 02:00:18.010
IT WAS IT WAS INCREDIBLY

02:00:18.077 --> 02:00:19.946
REFRESHING TO HEAR THAT OUR

02:00:20.012 --> 02:00:21.981
INDUSTRY PARTNERS ON THE BOARD

02:00:22.048 --> 02:00:24.016
SHARE SOME OF THE SAME CONCERNS

02:00:24.083 --> 02:00:25.651
THAT FACULTY HAVE ABOUT ISSUES

02:00:25.718 --> 02:00:28.588
OF ACCESS, SCALE, AND

02:00:28.654 --> 02:00:29.555
DEVELOPING CRITICAL THINKING

02:00:29.622 --> 02:00:30.456
AND THE REINFORCEMENT OF

02:00:30.523 --> 02:00:33.092
ETHICAL USE. THEY ALSO SEE

02:00:33.159 --> 02:00:34.393
INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

02:00:34.460 --> 02:00:37.263
OUR GRADUATES AND ARE HELPING

02:00:37.330 --> 02:00:38.297
CREATE THE AI LITERACY INDEX

02:00:38.364 --> 02:00:42.068
FOR OUR GRADUATES. AS WELL AS

02:00:42.134 --> 02:00:43.603
THIS WORK IS STILL IN ITS

02:00:43.669 --> 02:00:45.037
INFANCY. INFANCY. THE ASU HAS

02:00:45.104 --> 02:00:47.473
ALSO BEEN WORKING ON ADDITIONAL

02:00:47.540 --> 02:00:48.474
FORMAL RECOMMENDATIONS AND

02:00:48.541 --> 02:00:50.076
ISSUED TWO OF THOSE IN MAY, ONE

02:00:50.142 --> 02:00:52.345
OF THEM ON THE POSSIBLE USE OF

02:00:52.411 --> 02:00:54.747
AI IN INSTRUCTION, AND THEN

02:00:54.814 --> 02:00:56.148
ALSO URGING CAUTION IN THE USE

02:00:56.215 --> 02:00:58.050
OF GENERATIVE AI. AND I'LL JUST

02:00:58.117 --> 02:01:00.252
READ A COUPLE EXCERPTS FROM

02:01:00.319 --> 02:01:02.321
THOSE, WHICH IS THAT THE ASU

02:01:02.388 --> 02:01:05.358
WAS URGING THAT THE CSU

02:01:05.424 --> 02:01:06.258
CONSIDER OTHER CHALLENGES

02:01:06.325 --> 02:01:08.060
SURROUNDING CHEN AI, INCLUDING

02:01:08.127 --> 02:01:10.029
THAT AS A TECHNOLOGY, IT'S

02:01:10.096 --> 02:01:11.263
STILL IN ITS INFANCY. IT'S

02:01:11.330 --> 02:01:13.532
CURRENTLY SOMETIMES UNRELIABLE,

02:01:13.599 --> 02:01:15.868
OR REGULARLY PRODUCES

02:01:15.935 --> 02:01:17.970
INACCURACIES OR HAS BIAS,

02:01:18.037 --> 02:01:20.272
SOMETIMES OFTEN HILARIOUS, AND

02:01:20.339 --> 02:01:21.841
OTHER TIMES A LITTLE BIT

02:01:21.907 --> 02:01:24.076
DISTURBING OR WHOLLY DISTURBING.

02:01:24.143 --> 02:01:25.945
THE COMMITMENT OF ABOUT 17

02:01:26.012 --> 02:01:27.747
MILLION IN FINANCIAL RESOURCES

02:01:27.813 --> 02:01:31.250
BY THE CSU DID COME ABOUT

02:01:31.317 --> 02:01:33.252
WITHOUT CONSULTATION. AND AND

02:01:33.319 --> 02:01:35.154
THERE AND THERE'S CONCERNS

02:01:35.221 --> 02:01:38.391
ABOUT ITS SUSTAINABILITY,

02:01:38.457 --> 02:01:41.093
ESPECIALLY IN OUR PEDAGOGY. THE

02:01:41.160 --> 02:01:42.828
TEXT, DIGITAL IMAGERY, AUDIO,

02:01:42.895 --> 02:01:44.997
VIDEO AND OTHER INFORMATION AND

02:01:45.064 --> 02:01:46.198
PRODUCTS PRODUCED BY CHEN AI

02:01:46.265 --> 02:01:47.967
ARE OFTEN BUILT ON THE

02:01:48.034 --> 02:01:50.002
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OF OTHERS,

02:01:50.069 --> 02:01:52.872
FREQUENTLY WITHOUT REMUNERATION,

02:01:52.938 --> 02:01:54.206
CITATION OR EVEN RECOGNITION.

02:01:54.273 --> 02:01:55.908
SO THIS IS AN ISSUE. WE HOPE

02:01:55.975 --> 02:01:57.843
THAT WE COULD WE COULD DIVE

02:01:57.910 --> 02:02:00.579
INTO THE ENORMOUS USE OF

02:02:00.646 --> 02:02:01.881
ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES IS ALSO

02:02:01.947 --> 02:02:03.683
SOMETHING WE WANTED TO BE

02:02:03.749 --> 02:02:05.484
COGNIZANT OF, PARTICULARLY IN

02:02:05.551 --> 02:02:08.120
THE ENERGY NEEDED TO TRAIN

02:02:08.187 --> 02:02:14.427
THESE MODELS. AND LASTLY,

02:02:14.493 --> 02:02:15.995
POSSIBLE EXPLOITATION OF LOW

02:02:16.062 --> 02:02:19.465
WAGE LABOR TRAINING AND THE

02:02:19.532 --> 02:02:22.401
RUNNING AND MODELS AND

02:02:22.468 --> 02:02:24.003
REPLACEMENT OF HUMANS IN MUCH

02:02:24.070 --> 02:02:26.205
OF WHAT WE DO IN A FRONT FACING

02:02:26.272 --> 02:02:30.042
CSU. TO OUR STUDENTS. OVERALL,

02:02:30.109 --> 02:02:31.243
THERE'S A SMATTERING OF FACULTY

02:02:31.310 --> 02:02:32.812
INVOLVEMENT ACROSS THE CSU, AND

02:02:32.878 --> 02:02:34.113
THE AI COMMONS IS A HUGE STEP

02:02:34.180 --> 02:02:36.482
FORWARD FOR OUR SYSTEM,

02:02:36.549 --> 02:02:37.483
OFFERING SELF-GUIDED COURSES

02:02:37.550 --> 02:02:39.418
AND CERTIFICATES. WHILE STILL

02:02:39.485 --> 02:02:40.386
MORE OF OUR CAMPUSES HAVE BEEN

02:02:40.453 --> 02:02:42.088
WORKING ON AI AT VARIABLE

02:02:42.154 --> 02:02:43.989
SPEEDS AND ADOPTION FROM THE

02:02:44.056 --> 02:02:45.257
LENS OF THE ASU, THERE'S BOTH

02:02:45.324 --> 02:02:47.259
WIDESPREAD EXCITEMENT AND

02:02:47.326 --> 02:02:49.428
EXTREME CAUTION THAT I KNOW MY

02:02:49.495 --> 02:02:50.663
COLLEAGUES HERE WILL ADDRESS AS

02:02:50.730 --> 02:02:52.431
WELL. TO BE SUCCESSFUL, WE NEED

02:02:52.498 --> 02:02:55.634
FUNDING AND SUPPORT FOR FACULTY

02:02:55.701 --> 02:02:57.169
TRAININGS LIKE THOSE OFFERED AT

02:02:57.236 --> 02:03:00.239
AI COMMONS AND AND AT FACULTY

02:03:00.306 --> 02:03:01.941
DEVELOPMENT CENTERS AT EACH OF

02:03:02.007 --> 02:03:04.276
THE CAMPUSES. ALL FACULTY HAVE

02:03:04.343 --> 02:03:06.011
ACCESS TO THE AI COMMONS, BUT

02:03:06.078 --> 02:03:08.214
AS A SYSTEM, THESE MAY NOT BE

02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:09.315
AS COMPREHENSIVE FOR ALL THE

02:03:09.381 --> 02:03:12.017
DISCIPLINES THAT WILL BE TRYING

02:03:12.084 --> 02:03:16.021
TO WORK WITH THESE TOOLS. AND

02:03:16.088 --> 02:03:17.656
HAVING DEDICATED TIME MEANS

02:03:17.723 --> 02:03:20.760
THAT WE NEED MONEY TO DO THAT

02:03:20.826 --> 02:03:24.296
AS WELL. SO CHAIRS FONG AND

02:03:24.363 --> 02:03:25.331
BAUER-KAHAN AND MEMBERS, YOU

02:03:25.397 --> 02:03:27.600
STATED CONCERNS THAT ARE ALSO

02:03:27.666 --> 02:03:29.101
FACULTY CONCERNS, AND THERE

02:03:29.168 --> 02:03:31.203
STILL ARE NEW CONCERNS AS WE

02:03:31.270 --> 02:03:33.072
LEARN AND MOVE FORWARD WITH

02:03:33.139 --> 02:03:34.240
THESE TOOLS AND HOW WE

02:03:34.306 --> 02:03:36.041
INTEGRATE THEM IN THE CLASSROOM.

02:03:36.108 --> 02:03:38.077
WE WANT OUR CLASSROOMS TO

02:03:38.144 --> 02:03:40.212
CONTINUE TO BE SAFE LEARNING

02:03:40.279 --> 02:03:42.047
EXPERIENCES FOR OUR STUDENTS.

02:03:42.114 --> 02:03:44.483
THE BIGGEST CONCERN FOR FACULTY

02:03:44.550 --> 02:03:45.885
IS HOW TO PROCEED, ENSURING

02:03:45.951 --> 02:03:48.087
THAT WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE

02:03:48.154 --> 02:03:49.421
DIVERSITY THAT IS THE HALLMARK

02:03:49.488 --> 02:03:51.157
OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, AND

02:03:51.223 --> 02:03:53.292
THAT THESE TOOLS ARE USED WITH

02:03:53.359 --> 02:03:54.960
A CONSCIOUS EYE ON EQUITY,

02:03:55.027 --> 02:03:56.095
INCLUSIVITY, AND THAT WE MAY

02:03:56.162 --> 02:03:58.197
MAINTAIN HIGH FIDELITY IN THE

02:03:58.264 --> 02:03:59.064
ETHICAL USE OF THESE TOOLS

02:03:59.131 --> 02:04:01.066
WHILE ENSURING THAT WE MAINTAIN

02:04:01.133 --> 02:04:02.201
A LEARNING ENVIRONMENT WHERE

02:04:02.268 --> 02:04:04.136
STUDENTS HAVE THE ABILITY TO

02:04:04.203 --> 02:04:06.472
CRITICALLY EVALUATE THE WORLD,

02:04:06.539 --> 02:04:08.007
ENSURE THAT THE CSU CONTINUES

02:04:08.073 --> 02:04:10.176
TO MAINTAIN A DEGREE THAT

02:04:10.242 --> 02:04:11.343
ELEVATES THE SOCIAL AND

02:04:11.410 --> 02:04:13.045
ECONOMIC MOBILITY OF OUR

02:04:13.112 --> 02:04:14.146
STUDENTS, THAT OUR GRADUATES

02:04:14.213 --> 02:04:16.582
CAN CONTRIBUTE AND ELEVATE, AND

02:04:16.649 --> 02:04:19.485
INCLUSIVE DEMOCRACY AND SUCCEED

02:04:19.552 --> 02:04:21.020
IN THEIR CAREERS. THAT ACADEMIC

02:04:21.086 --> 02:04:22.488
FREEDOM AND INTELLECTUAL

02:04:22.555 --> 02:04:24.156
PROPERTY REMAIN IN THE HANDS OF

02:04:24.223 --> 02:04:25.157
FACULTY AND THE STUDENTS THAT

02:04:25.224 --> 02:04:28.327
EMPLOY THE TOOLS. AND LASTLY,

02:04:28.394 --> 02:04:30.429
THE AC IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR

02:04:30.496 --> 02:04:32.198
HUMAN OR HUMAN EXPERIENCE.

02:04:32.264 --> 02:04:34.867
THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME

02:04:34.934 --> 02:04:35.501

02:04:38.270 --> 02:04:41.040
ESSENTIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THE

02:04:41.106 --> 02:04:42.308
CSU, AND WE REALLY DEEPLY

02:04:42.374 --> 02:04:44.844
APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU SO

THE CFA'S 43 YEAR HISTORY.

02:05:19.912 --> 02:05:21.347
FILIPINOS HAVE A DEEP AND

02:05:21.413 --> 02:05:22.181
POWERFUL HISTORY IN

02:05:22.248 --> 02:05:23.849
CALIFORNIA'S LABOR MOVEMENT,

02:05:23.916 --> 02:05:26.085
AND I CARRY FORWARD THAT LEGACY

02:05:26.151 --> 02:05:27.720
OF COLLECTIVE STRUGGLE FOR

02:05:27.786 --> 02:05:29.955
DIGNITY, EQUITY, AND JUSTICE.

02:05:30.022 --> 02:05:32.358
CFA REPRESENTS 29,000 FACULTY

02:05:32.424 --> 02:05:35.694
ACROSS THE CSU PROFESSORS,

02:05:35.761 --> 02:05:36.996
LECTURERS, COUNSELORS,

02:05:37.062 --> 02:05:38.931

HALF A MILLION STUDENTS EVERY

02:05:40.833 --> 02:05:42.935
TERM. I SPEAK TO YOU TODAY WITH

02:05:43.002 --> 02:05:44.670
BOTH THE LIVED EXPERIENCE OF A

02:05:44.737 --> 02:05:45.804
FACULTY MEMBER IN THE CLASSROOM

02:05:45.871 --> 02:05:48.007
FOR NEARLY 20 YEARS AND WITH

02:05:48.073 --> 02:05:49.174
THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

02:05:49.241 --> 02:05:51.277
COLLECTIVE VOICE OF OUR UNION

02:05:51.343 --> 02:05:52.077
IN CHEMISTRY COURSES FOR

02:05:52.144 --> 02:05:54.280
NON-STEM MAJORS, I SEE STUDENTS

02:05:54.346 --> 02:05:56.148
ARRIVE ANXIOUS, CONVINCED THEY

02:05:56.215 --> 02:05:58.117
DO NOT BELONG IN SCIENCE.

02:05:58.183 --> 02:05:59.885
CHEMISTRY IS ONE OF THE MOST

02:05:59.952 --> 02:06:01.320
HISTORICALLY DIFFICULT COURSES

02:06:01.387 --> 02:06:02.521
WITH HIGH FAILURE AND DROP

02:06:02.588 --> 02:06:04.924
RATES, AND NEARLY EVERY STUDENT

02:06:04.990 --> 02:06:06.725
HAS HAD A CAUTIONARY TALE ABOUT

02:06:06.792 --> 02:06:08.827
IT. BUT IN MY OWN CLASSROOM, WE

02:06:08.894 --> 02:06:11.030
HAVE ALREADY BEEN USING A

02:06:11.096 --> 02:06:12.131
THOUGHTFULLY WITH ETHICS,

02:06:12.197 --> 02:06:13.499
EQUITY, AND ACCESSIBILITY AT

02:06:13.565 --> 02:06:16.535
THE CENTER. WHEN FRAMED THIS

02:06:16.602 --> 02:06:17.870
WAY, STUDENTS BEGIN TO CONNECT

02:06:17.937 --> 02:06:20.306
CHEMISTRY TO THEIR OWN FIELDS,

02:06:20.372 --> 02:06:22.241
FROM ART TO BUSINESS TO HEALTH,

02:06:22.308 --> 02:06:24.343
COMMUNICATION AND EVEN DANCE.

02:06:24.410 --> 02:06:25.110
THEY DISCOVER CONFIDENCE AND

02:06:25.177 --> 02:06:27.046
OWNERSHIP IN A SUBJECT THEY

02:06:27.112 --> 02:06:29.048
ONCE THOUGHT WAS CLOSED OFF TO

02:06:29.114 --> 02:06:30.716
THEM. IF STUDENTS CAN FIND THAT

02:06:30.783 --> 02:06:32.985
AGENCY IN CHEMISTRY, ONE OF THE

02:06:33.052 --> 02:06:34.253
MOST CHALLENGING COURSES IN

02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:35.888
HIGHER EDUCATION, THEN I HAS

02:06:35.955 --> 02:06:37.289
THE POTENTIAL TO HELP EVERY CSU

02:06:37.356 --> 02:06:38.757
STUDENT FEEL CAPABLE AND

02:06:38.824 --> 02:06:41.994
INCLUDED. BUT I ALSO RISK

02:06:42.061 --> 02:06:43.228
UNDERMINING CRITICAL THINKING

02:06:43.295 --> 02:06:45.097
IF STUDENTS COME TO BELIEVE

02:06:45.164 --> 02:06:47.066
THAT THEY CAN OUTSOURCE

02:06:47.132 --> 02:06:47.866
ANALYSIS AND REASONING TO AN

02:06:47.933 --> 02:06:50.636
ALGORITHM, THEY LOSE THE VERY

02:06:50.703 --> 02:06:51.303
HABIT OF QUESTIONING AND

02:06:51.370 --> 02:06:53.105
REFLECTION THAT ARE A CORE OF A

02:06:53.172 --> 02:06:54.940
UNIVERSITY EDUCATION. ONE

02:06:55.007 --> 02:06:57.242
LESSON I CARRY FROM MY WORK IS

02:06:57.309 --> 02:06:58.877
THAT TRUE STUDENT SUCCESS

02:06:58.944 --> 02:07:01.046
DEPENDS ON AUTONOMY AND AGENCY

02:07:01.113 --> 02:07:02.014
ON STUDENTS HAVING THE ABILITY

02:07:02.081 --> 02:07:04.516
TO SHAPE THEIR OWN LEARNING

02:07:04.583 --> 02:07:05.351
EXPERIENCES. PROTECTING PRIVACY

02:07:05.417 --> 02:07:06.952
IS THE FOUNDATION THAT ALLOWS

02:07:07.019 --> 02:07:09.588
STUDENTS TO TRUST THE SYSTEM,

02:07:09.655 --> 02:07:10.522
TAKE OWNERSHIP OF THEIR

02:07:10.589 --> 02:07:12.024
EDUCATION, AND ENGAGE FULLY AS

02:07:12.091 --> 02:07:13.459
PARTNERS IN THE LEARNING

02:07:13.525 --> 02:07:15.227
PROCESS. THE SAME IS TRUE FOR

02:07:15.294 --> 02:07:16.996
OUR FACULTY. OUR SUCCESS AND

02:07:17.062 --> 02:07:19.064
ACADEMIC FREEDOM DEPEND ON THE

02:07:19.131 --> 02:07:19.865
PROFESSIONAL AGENCY IN TEACHING

02:07:19.932 --> 02:07:21.200
AND MENTORING, SUPPORTED BY

02:07:21.266 --> 02:07:24.103
TOOLS AND POLICIES WE CAN TRUST.

02:07:24.169 --> 02:07:25.404
I KNOW THIS NOT ONLY FROM MY

02:07:25.471 --> 02:07:27.039
CLASSROOM, BUT ALSO FROM MY

02:07:27.106 --> 02:07:29.108
RESEARCH, MY DOCTORAL WORK ON

02:07:29.174 --> 02:07:30.142
THE CSU'S COURSE REDESIGN WITH

02:07:30.209 --> 02:07:31.310
TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM FOUND THAT

02:07:31.377 --> 02:07:33.045
THE MOST MEANINGFUL

02:07:33.112 --> 02:07:33.912
IMPROVEMENTS DID NOT COME FROM

02:07:33.979 --> 02:07:36.348
SIMPLY ADDING TOOLS. THEY CAME

02:07:36.415 --> 02:07:37.082
WHEN FACULTY COLLABORATED,

02:07:37.149 --> 02:07:39.218
REDESIGNED INTENTIONALLY, AND

02:07:39.284 --> 02:07:40.085
USED TECHNOLOGY TO DEEPEN

02:07:40.152 --> 02:07:42.287
RATHER THAN REPLACE HUMAN

02:07:42.354 --> 02:07:43.989
BEINGS. IN TEACHING. THOSE

02:07:44.056 --> 02:07:46.025
REDESIGNS LED TO MEASURABLE GPA

02:07:46.091 --> 02:07:47.326
GAINS AND STUDENT ENGAGEMENT.

02:07:47.393 --> 02:07:49.128
WHEN BOTH STUDENT AND FACULTY

02:07:49.194 --> 02:07:50.562
AGENCY WERE SUPPORTED,

02:07:50.629 --> 02:07:52.865
INNOVATION WORKED. WHEN EITHER

02:07:52.931 --> 02:07:55.934
WAS IGNORED, IT FAILED. THIS IS

02:07:56.001 --> 02:07:58.337
WHY. THIS IS WHY THIS AI

02:07:58.404 --> 02:07:59.138
INITIATIVE RAISES ALARMS. IT

02:07:59.204 --> 02:08:00.305
WAS ROLLED OUT WITHOUT

02:08:00.372 --> 02:08:01.874
CONSULTATION WITH FACULTY,

02:08:01.940 --> 02:08:04.076
CAMPUSES OR OUR UNION.

02:08:04.143 --> 02:08:05.110
WORKPLACE CONDITIONS ARE PART

02:08:05.177 --> 02:08:06.045
OF OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

02:08:06.111 --> 02:08:08.480
AGREEMENT AND ANY CHANGE IN

02:08:08.547 --> 02:08:10.949
WORKLOAD IS MANDATORY. SUBJECT

02:08:11.016 --> 02:08:13.185
BARGAINING. UNDER HERA, THE

02:08:13.252 --> 02:08:14.820
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE HAS A LEGAL

02:08:14.887 --> 02:08:16.155
OBLIGATION TO MEET AND CONFER

02:08:16.221 --> 02:08:17.723
WITH US. INSTEAD, THIS

02:08:17.790 --> 02:08:18.824
INITIATIVE WAS IMPOSED

02:08:18.891 --> 02:08:20.993
UNILATERALLY. THE DOLLARS ARE

02:08:21.060 --> 02:08:22.828
STAGGERING. THE CSU HAS ALREADY

02:08:22.895 --> 02:08:24.096
SPENT $17 MILLION ON THIS

02:08:24.163 --> 02:08:26.165
INITIATIVE. AT THE SAME TIME,

02:08:26.231 --> 02:08:28.333
SONOMA STATE FACED A $24

02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:29.134
MILLION DEFICIT THAT LED TO THE

02:08:29.201 --> 02:08:31.136
LARGEST LAYOFF IN ITS HISTORY,

02:08:31.203 --> 02:08:32.337
WITH FACULTY CUT, DEPARTMENTS

02:08:32.404 --> 02:08:34.506
CLOSED AND ATHLETICS ELIMINATED.

02:08:34.573 --> 02:08:37.176
THIS JUXTAPOSITION REVEALS

02:08:37.242 --> 02:08:38.043
CSU'S BUDGET PRIORITIES, FLASHY

02:08:38.110 --> 02:08:40.079
TECH AND CORPORATE PARTNERSHIPS

02:08:40.145 --> 02:08:41.413
OVER THE LIVELIHOODS OF WORKERS

02:08:41.480 --> 02:08:43.382
AND THE STABILITY OF OUR

02:08:43.449 --> 02:08:45.084
CAMPUSES. FACULTY AND STUDENTS

02:08:45.150 --> 02:08:46.118
DESERVE BETTER, AND LEGISLATORS

02:08:46.185 --> 02:08:48.053
DESERVE BUDGET TRANSPARENCY.

02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:50.923
AND YES, THE CSU HAS INVESTED

02:08:50.989 --> 02:08:52.091
$3 MILLION IN COMPETITIVE

02:08:52.157 --> 02:08:53.959
GRANTS WITH AWARDS 30 TO

02:08:54.026 --> 02:08:55.594
$60,000 EACH TO SPARK FACULTY

02:08:55.661 --> 02:08:57.029
INNOVATION. THAT IS AN

02:08:57.096 --> 02:08:58.263
IMPORTANT STEP, AND MANY

02:08:58.330 --> 02:08:59.898
COLLEAGUES HAVE DEVELOPED

02:08:59.965 --> 02:09:00.999
CREATIVE PROJECTS THROUGH THIS

02:09:01.066 --> 02:09:02.301
OPPORTUNITY. BUT GRANTS LIKE

02:09:02.367 --> 02:09:03.869
THESE ARE THE BEGINNING, NOT

02:09:03.936 --> 02:09:06.038
THE END OF WHAT IS NEEDED.

02:09:06.105 --> 02:09:07.372
CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE WILL NOT

02:09:07.439 --> 02:09:10.409
BE SHAPED BY A HANDFUL OF PILOT

02:09:10.476 --> 02:09:11.610
CLASSROOMS. IT WILL BE SHAPED

02:09:11.677 --> 02:09:12.845
BY EVERY CSU GRADUATE. THE

02:09:12.911 --> 02:09:14.546
CHALLENGE NOW IS SCALING THOSE

02:09:14.613 --> 02:09:16.548
PROMISING MODELS ACROSS ALL 23

02:09:16.615 --> 02:09:17.883
CAMPUSES AND DISCIPLINES. AND

02:09:17.950 --> 02:09:19.151
THIS IS WHERE THE CHANCELLOR'S

02:09:19.218 --> 02:09:21.286
OFFICE FALLS SHORT, PRESENTING

02:09:21.353 --> 02:09:22.354
COMPETITIVE GRANTS AND VENDOR

02:09:22.421 --> 02:09:23.989
PARTNERSHIPS AS IF THEY

02:09:24.056 --> 02:09:25.157
CONSTITUTE A SYSTEM WIDE

02:09:25.224 --> 02:09:27.926
STRATEGY. THEY DO NOT. WE ARE

02:09:27.993 --> 02:09:29.228
ALSO DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT JOB

02:09:29.294 --> 02:09:31.763
SECURITY. MANAGERS HAVE ALREADY

02:09:31.830 --> 02:09:33.265
TRIED TO ROLL OUT AI TUTORING

02:09:33.332 --> 02:09:34.733
BOTS THAT HALLUCINATE AND

02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:36.935
ADVISE. OUR UNION HAD TO

02:09:37.002 --> 02:09:38.837
INTERVENE AND TO SHUT THEM DOWN.

02:09:38.904 --> 02:09:40.506
BOTS CANNOT REPLACE FACULTY,

02:09:40.572 --> 02:09:41.974
COUNSELORS, COACHES OR

02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:43.842
LIBRARIANS. THERE ARE RISKS

02:09:43.909 --> 02:09:45.144
AROUND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

02:09:45.210 --> 02:09:47.179
IT WOULD BE NAIVE TO BELIEVE

02:09:47.246 --> 02:09:48.814
CORPORATIONS PROVIDE ACCESS FOR

02:09:48.881 --> 02:09:49.948
PENNIES WITHOUT EXTRACTING

02:09:50.015 --> 02:09:52.084
VALUE IN RETURN. WHAT THEY WANT

02:09:52.151 --> 02:09:53.185
IS OUR DATA, STUDENT QUERIES,

02:09:53.252 --> 02:09:54.153
ASSIGNMENTS, AND FACULTY

02:09:54.219 --> 02:09:56.455
TEACHING MATERIALS. AS ETHAN

02:09:56.522 --> 02:09:58.190
MOLLICK POINTS IN

02:09:58.257 --> 02:09:59.057
CO-INTELLIGENCE, AI COMPANIES

02:09:59.124 --> 02:10:01.627
ARE RUNNING OUT OF HIGH QUALITY

02:10:01.693 --> 02:10:03.328
DATA TO TRAIN ON, WHICH MAKES

02:10:03.395 --> 02:10:05.697
OUR CLASSROOMS ESPECIALLY

02:10:05.764 --> 02:10:06.265
ATTRACTIVE SOURCES FOR

02:10:06.331 --> 02:10:09.001
KNOWLEDGE AND DATA EXTRACTION.

02:10:09.067 --> 02:10:11.203
THESE SYSTEMS CAN ALSO BE

02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:12.070
WEAPONIZED FOR SURVEILLANCE

02:10:12.137 --> 02:10:14.006
OVER FACULTY ASSIGNED AND TEACH,

02:10:14.072 --> 02:10:15.674
ESPECIALLY THOSE OF US TEACHING

02:10:15.741 --> 02:10:17.976
RACE, GENDER OR POWER. THAT IS

02:10:18.043 --> 02:10:19.611
A DIRECT THREAT TO ACADEMIC

02:10:19.678 --> 02:10:20.846
FREEDOM. AND LET'S BE CLEAR

02:10:20.913 --> 02:10:23.081
ABOUT BIAS. AI DOES NOT JUST

02:10:23.148 --> 02:10:24.316
MAKE RANDOM ERRORS, IT

02:10:24.383 --> 02:10:25.884
REPRODUCES STRUCTURAL,

02:10:25.951 --> 02:10:27.219
STRUCTURAL RACISM. AS SCHOLAR

02:10:27.286 --> 02:10:29.588
RUHA BENJAMIN REMINDS US IN

02:10:29.655 --> 02:10:31.290
RACE AFTER TECHNOLOGY, THESE

02:10:31.356 --> 02:10:32.457
SYSTEMS ARE NOT NEUTRAL. THEY

02:10:32.524 --> 02:10:34.359
ENCODE INEQUALITY, INCLUDING

02:10:34.426 --> 02:10:36.261
ANTI-BLACKNESS, INTO THEIR

02:10:36.328 --> 02:10:38.497
DESIGN. CSU STUDENTS, BLACK,

02:10:38.564 --> 02:10:40.065
INDIGENOUS, LATINX, IMMIGRANT,

02:10:40.132 --> 02:10:43.068
QUEER, TRANS FIRST GEN DISABLED

02:10:43.135 --> 02:10:44.136
STUDENTS SHOULD NOT BE HANDED

02:10:44.203 --> 02:10:45.337
TOOLS THAT REINFORCE THE

02:10:45.404 --> 02:10:46.738
DISCRIMINATION THEY FACE IN

02:10:46.805 --> 02:10:49.041
SOCIETY, WHICH IS WHY IT IS SO

02:10:49.107 --> 02:10:51.310
CRUCIAL TO ENSURE THE LONGEVITY

02:10:51.376 --> 02:10:52.511
OF OUR ETHNIC STUDIES PROGRAMS

02:10:52.578 --> 02:10:54.413
AND DEPARTMENTS. THE

02:10:54.479 --> 02:10:56.815
ENVIRONMENTAL TOLL IS ALSO REAL.

02:10:56.882 --> 02:10:58.150
GENERATIVE AI CONSUMES

02:10:58.217 --> 02:10:59.251
STAGGERING AMOUNTS OF

02:10:59.318 --> 02:11:00.953
ELECTRICITY AND WATER. EVERY

02:11:01.019 --> 02:11:03.121
QUERY DRAWS ON SERVER FARMS

02:11:03.188 --> 02:11:04.423
COOLED WITH WATER DIVERTED FROM

02:11:04.489 --> 02:11:05.791
COMMUNITIES ALREADY FACING

02:11:05.857 --> 02:11:07.226
SCARCITY. DATA CENTERS NOW

02:11:07.292 --> 02:11:09.328
ACCOUNT FOR MORE THAN 4% OF THE

02:11:09.394 --> 02:11:11.096
US ELECTRICITY USAGE, MUCH OF

02:11:11.163 --> 02:11:13.432
IT STILL FOSSIL FUEL AND

02:11:13.498 --> 02:11:14.032
TRAINING A SINGLE LARGE MODEL

02:11:14.099 --> 02:11:17.903
LIKE GPT THREE CAN CONSUME UP

02:11:17.970 --> 02:11:19.905
TO 700,000L OF FRESH WATER.

02:11:19.972 --> 02:11:21.206
CAESAR PROCLAIMS A

02:11:21.273 --> 02:11:22.341
SUSTAINABILITY MISSION, YET

02:11:22.407 --> 02:11:23.875
THIS INITIATIVE ACCELERATES

02:11:23.942 --> 02:11:25.544
ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION.

02:11:25.611 --> 02:11:27.179
TRAINING THE NEXT GENERATION IS

02:11:27.246 --> 02:11:29.047
MEANINGLESS IF THEY DO NOT HAVE

02:11:29.114 --> 02:11:32.184
A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE TO INHERIT.

02:11:32.251 --> 02:11:33.452
AI IS ALSO CREATING MORE WORK

02:11:33.518 --> 02:11:35.053
FOR FACULTY. WE ARE REDESIGNING

02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:37.189
ASSIGNMENTS, RETHINKING EXAMS,

02:11:37.256 --> 02:11:38.090
ADJUSTING CLASSROOM POLICIES

02:11:38.156 --> 02:11:40.058
AND DOUBLE CHECKING WORK WITH

02:11:40.125 --> 02:11:41.660
UNRELIABLE DETECTORS, ALL ON

02:11:41.727 --> 02:11:42.361
TOP OF EXISTING

02:11:42.427 --> 02:11:44.429
RESPONSIBILITIES WITH NO ADDED

02:11:44.496 --> 02:11:45.831
SUPPORT. THIS IS WHY CFA IS

02:11:45.897 --> 02:11:48.066
CALLING ON CSU MANAGERS TO

02:11:48.133 --> 02:11:50.836
CONSULT FACULTY AND STAFF FIRST.

02:11:50.902 --> 02:11:53.171
WHEN I CHANGES HOW WE TEACH,

02:11:53.238 --> 02:11:54.940
HOW WE GRADE, HOW WE ADVISE, IT

02:11:55.007 --> 02:11:57.009
CHANGES OUR WORKING CONDITIONS.

02:11:57.075 --> 02:11:58.377
CSU MUST MEET AND CONFER WITH

02:11:58.443 --> 02:12:01.013
OUR UNION AS THE LAW REQUIRES.

02:12:01.079 --> 02:12:02.247
PROVIDE FUNDED OPTIONAL

02:12:02.314 --> 02:12:04.016
TRAINING AT SCALE. IF FACULTY

02:12:04.082 --> 02:12:05.117
ARE TO INTEGRATE AI

02:12:05.183 --> 02:12:06.585
THOUGHTFULLY, THEY NEED TIME

02:12:06.652 --> 02:12:07.853
AND RESOURCES, STIPENDS,

02:12:07.919 --> 02:12:09.054
RELEASE TIME, PROFESSIONAL

02:12:09.121 --> 02:12:11.023
DEVELOPMENT, NOT UNPAID LABOR.

02:12:11.089 --> 02:12:12.824
KEEP HUMANS AT THE CENTER.

02:12:12.891 --> 02:12:14.026
STUDENTS COME TO CSU FOR

02:12:14.092 --> 02:12:17.095
MENTORSHIP, GUIDANCE, AND CARE.

02:12:17.162 --> 02:12:18.096
I CAN SUPPLEMENT BUT MUST NEVER

02:12:18.163 --> 02:12:20.265
REPLACE THIS. PROTECT PRIVACY

02:12:20.332 --> 02:12:22.968
AND ACADEMIC FREEDOM. NO

02:12:23.035 --> 02:12:24.102
FACULTY MATERIAL SHOULD BE

02:12:24.169 --> 02:12:25.170
UPLOADED INTO CORPORATE SYSTEMS

02:12:25.237 --> 02:12:26.905
WITHOUT CONSENT. NO STUDENT

02:12:26.972 --> 02:12:29.041
DATA SHOULD BE MINED OR SOLD.

02:12:29.107 --> 02:12:30.175
PROTECTION SHOULD MEET THE

02:12:30.242 --> 02:12:31.610
STANDARDS OF THE GENERAL

02:12:31.677 --> 02:12:33.111
PROTECTION REGULATION IN EUROPE

02:12:33.178 --> 02:12:35.781
AND CALIFORNIA'S CONSUMER

02:12:35.847 --> 02:12:37.149
PRIVACY ACT REQUIRE EQUITY AND

02:12:37.215 --> 02:12:39.618
BIAS AUDITS. INDEPENDENT AUDITS

02:12:39.685 --> 02:12:41.987
MUST BE MANDATORY BEFORE CSU

02:12:42.054 --> 02:12:43.855
DEPLOYS ANY AI TOOL.

02:12:43.922 --> 02:12:46.458
COMMUNITIES MOST AT RISK ARE

02:12:46.525 --> 02:12:47.826
THE VERY STUDENTS CSU IS MEANT

02:12:47.893 --> 02:12:49.928
TO SERVE. BLACK STUDENTS,

02:12:49.995 --> 02:12:51.163
INDIGENOUS STUDENTS, LATINX AND

02:12:51.229 --> 02:12:53.632
IMMIGRANT STUDENTS, QUEER AND

02:12:53.699 --> 02:12:54.766
TRANS STUDENTS, AND STUDENTS

02:12:54.833 --> 02:12:56.401
WITH DISABILITIES. MANDATE

02:12:56.468 --> 02:12:57.836
TRANSPARENCY. IF CSU SIGNS

02:12:57.903 --> 02:13:00.105
CONTRACTS WITH TECH COMPANIES,

02:13:00.172 --> 02:13:02.140
THOSE CONTRACTS MUST BE PUBLIC.

02:13:02.207 --> 02:13:04.142
T I AI BUDGETS TO HUMAN SUPPORT.

02:13:04.209 --> 02:13:05.944
EVERY DOLLAR SPENT ON AI MUST

02:13:06.011 --> 02:13:07.813
BE MANDATED BY INVESTMENTS IN

02:13:07.879 --> 02:13:10.349
HUMAN CAPACITY. FACULTY HIRING,

02:13:10.415 --> 02:13:11.083
ADVISING, COUNSELING AND

02:13:11.149 --> 02:13:14.419
STUDENT SUPPORT. AND FINALLY,

02:13:14.486 --> 02:13:16.188
ENSURE BUDGET TRANSPARENCY.

02:13:16.254 --> 02:13:17.956
LEGISLATORS, FACULTY AND

02:13:18.023 --> 02:13:19.291
STUDENTS MUST SEE EXACTLY HOW

02:13:19.358 --> 02:13:21.993
AI DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT.

02:13:22.060 --> 02:13:23.195
FACULTY AND STUDENTS MUST NOT

02:13:23.261 --> 02:13:25.163
BE TREATED AS BETA TESTERS FOR

02:13:25.230 --> 02:13:26.932
CORPORATE TOOLS. IF AI IS TRUE

02:13:26.998 --> 02:13:28.667
TO EMPOWER, IT MUST REDUCE

02:13:28.734 --> 02:13:29.301
INEQUITY, RESPECT PRIVACY, AND

02:13:29.368 --> 02:13:32.104
PUT HUMANS AT THE CENTER. IF MY

02:13:32.170 --> 02:13:33.071
NON-STEM STUDENTS CAN FIND

02:13:33.138 --> 02:13:34.506
CONFIDENCE IN OWNERSHIP IN

02:13:34.573 --> 02:13:37.442
CHEMISTRY, A COURSE WITH ONE OF

02:13:37.509 --> 02:13:38.543
THE HIGHEST FAILURE AND DROP

02:13:38.610 --> 02:13:41.146
RATES, THEN CSU SHOULD BE ABLE

02:13:41.213 --> 02:13:42.381
TO FIND THE SAME SENSE OF

02:13:42.447 --> 02:13:45.350
AGENCY IN THEIR EDUCATION. THE

02:13:45.417 --> 02:13:46.318
QUESTION BEFORE US IS SIMPLE

02:13:46.385 --> 02:13:47.953
WILL I HELP US BUILD THAT

02:13:48.019 --> 02:13:51.123
FUTURE OR WILL IT ERODE IT?

02:13:51.189 --> 02:13:52.290
TRUE INNOVATION AND PUBLIC

02:13:52.357 --> 02:13:52.958
HIGHER EDUCATION IS NOT

02:13:53.024 --> 02:13:55.026
MEASURED BY CONTRACTS OR

02:13:55.093 --> 02:13:57.362
PROJECT PILOT PROJECTS. IT IS

02:13:57.429 --> 02:13:59.097
MEASURED IN WHETHER EVERY

02:13:59.164 --> 02:14:00.732
STUDENT AND EVERY FACULTY

02:14:00.799 --> 02:14:02.968
MEMBER IS EMPOWERED TO SUCCEED.

02:14:03.034 --> 02:14:04.870
THAT IS THE STANDARD CSU SHOULD

02:14:04.936 --> 02:14:07.572
MEET, AND THAT IS THE STANDARD

02:14:07.639 --> 02:14:09.441
THAT CALIFORNIA DESERVES. THANK

02:14:09.508 --> 02:14:12.377
YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME.

02:14:12.444 --> 02:14:14.379
THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON.

02:14:14.446 --> 02:14:15.947
CHAIR AND CO-CHAIR AND MEMBER.

02:14:16.014 --> 02:14:18.650
MY NAME IS CATHERINE HUTCHINSON.

02:14:18.717 --> 02:14:19.284
I'M PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA

02:14:19.351 --> 02:14:20.285
STATE UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES

02:14:20.352 --> 02:14:22.220
UNION, AND I SPEAK TO YOU TODAY

02:14:22.287 --> 02:14:23.889
FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE

02:14:23.955 --> 02:14:25.390
STAFF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE

02:14:25.457 --> 02:14:27.058
UNIVERSITY. WE ARE THE PEOPLE

02:14:27.125 --> 02:14:28.827
WHO KEEP THE CSU RUNNING EVERY

02:14:28.894 --> 02:14:30.162
DAY THROUGH STUDENT SERVICES,

02:14:30.228 --> 02:14:32.697
IT, SUPPORT LABS, LIBRARIES,

02:14:32.764 --> 02:14:35.033
PAYROLL FACILITIES, AND BEYOND.

02:14:35.100 --> 02:14:36.835
THE CSU RECENTLY MADE A

02:14:36.902 --> 02:14:38.670
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN

02:14:38.737 --> 02:14:39.237
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. FOR

02:14:39.304 --> 02:14:41.573
MANY, AI FEELS LIKE THE

02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:42.941
BEGINNING OF A REVOLUTION. BUT

02:14:43.008 --> 02:14:44.209
HERE'S THE TRUTH WITH ANY

02:14:44.276 --> 02:14:46.978
REVOLUTION, TECHNOLOGY ONLY

02:14:47.045 --> 02:14:48.513
SUCCEEDS WHEN WORKERS SHAPE IT.

02:14:48.580 --> 02:14:49.714
WITHOUT THE PEOPLE WHO

02:14:49.781 --> 02:14:50.715
UNDERSTAND HOW CAMPUSES

02:14:50.782 --> 02:14:53.118
FUNCTION, I RISK BEING ANOTHER

02:14:53.185 --> 02:14:54.252
TOP DOWN CONCEPTUAL ROLLOUT

02:14:54.319 --> 02:14:56.087
THAT DISRUPTS THE FRACTURES

02:14:56.154 --> 02:14:57.255
RATHER THAN IMPROVING HIGHER

02:14:57.322 --> 02:14:59.291
EDUCATION. WHEN SYSTEMS LIKE AI

02:14:59.357 --> 02:15:01.126
ARE INTRODUCED WITHOUT INPUT

02:15:01.193 --> 02:15:03.762
FROM STAFF, THEY FAIL TO

02:15:03.829 --> 02:15:04.262
ACCOUNT FOR REAL WORKING

02:15:04.329 --> 02:15:06.031
CONDITIONS. WORKERS NEED A SEAT

02:15:06.097 --> 02:15:07.365
AT THE TABLE, NOT AS AN

02:15:07.432 --> 02:15:09.034
AFTERTHOUGHT, BUT AS A CENTRAL

02:15:09.100 --> 02:15:10.969
PARTNER. WE ARE THE ONES WHO

02:15:11.036 --> 02:15:12.437
UNDERSTAND THE OUTLIER

02:15:12.504 --> 02:15:14.272
SCENARIOS, BOTTLENECKS, THE

02:15:14.339 --> 02:15:15.140
STUDENT AND FACULTY NEEDS, AND

02:15:15.207 --> 02:15:16.408
WHICH GAPS TECHNOLOGY MIGHT

02:15:16.475 --> 02:15:18.910
FILL OR CREATE VOIDS. WE ARE

02:15:18.977 --> 02:15:20.779
THE DRIVING FORCE THAT WILL

02:15:20.846 --> 02:15:23.281
MAKE CHEN AI A REALITY. IF AI

02:15:23.348 --> 02:15:24.015
IS INDEED A REVOLUTION, A

02:15:24.082 --> 02:15:26.151
SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION GOES

02:15:26.218 --> 02:15:28.587
BEYOND A CONTRACT HANDSHAKE.

02:15:28.653 --> 02:15:30.188
SOFTWARE LICENSES, A COUPLE OF

02:15:30.255 --> 02:15:32.257
CONSULTANTS AND NON PRE-TRAINED

02:15:32.324 --> 02:15:34.693
PRE-TRAINED MODELS. IT INVOLVES

02:15:34.759 --> 02:15:35.427
ORGANIZATIONAL RESTRUCTURING.

02:15:35.494 --> 02:15:37.229
THAT RESTRUCTURING MUST BE

02:15:37.295 --> 02:15:38.396
INTENTIONAL, NEGOTIATED AND

02:15:38.463 --> 02:15:41.166
JUST WE HAVE SOME SOLUTIONS

02:15:41.233 --> 02:15:42.567
WHICH ARE CREATE WORKER

02:15:42.634 --> 02:15:43.902
COUNCILS WHERE EMPLOYEES AND

02:15:43.969 --> 02:15:45.971
MANAGEMENT COLLABORATE IN A

02:15:46.037 --> 02:15:47.239
VISIONARY MANNER ON HOW AND

02:15:47.305 --> 02:15:48.874
WHICH AI TOOLS ARE INTRODUCED,

02:15:48.940 --> 02:15:50.108
TESTED AND REFINED FOR

02:15:50.175 --> 02:15:52.143
SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION.

02:15:52.210 --> 02:15:53.845
NEGOTIATE GUARDRAILS TO ENSURE

02:15:53.912 --> 02:15:55.213
AI IS USED RESPONSIBLY.

02:15:55.280 --> 02:15:57.115
PROTECTING DATA PRIVACY OR

02:15:57.182 --> 02:15:57.883
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY,

02:15:57.949 --> 02:15:59.985
PREVENTING BIAS, AND AVOIDING

02:16:00.051 --> 02:16:02.153
JOB DISPLACEMENT. REDUCING

02:16:02.220 --> 02:16:03.889
WORKER ANXIETY BY INVOLVING

02:16:03.955 --> 02:16:05.123
STAFF EARLY AND OFTEN, AND

02:16:05.190 --> 02:16:06.324
EMPOWERING THEM. OUR EMPLOYEES

02:16:06.391 --> 02:16:08.293
SHOULD NOT ENCOUNTER SURPRISE,

02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:09.194
STEEP LEARNING CURVES OR FEEL

02:16:09.261 --> 02:16:11.229
REPLACED BY MACHINES, BUT

02:16:11.296 --> 02:16:12.964
INSTEAD BE EMPOWERED BY THEM.

02:16:13.031 --> 02:16:14.332
AND OF COURSE, FOCUSED ADOPTION

02:16:14.399 --> 02:16:16.334
THAT IMPROVES PRODUCTIVITY AND

02:16:16.401 --> 02:16:18.003
STUDENT SUCCESS. RATHER THAN

02:16:18.069 --> 02:16:20.438
CHASING FLASHY TECH TRENDS AND

02:16:20.505 --> 02:16:21.239
CRITICALLY CLOSE SURVEILLANCE

02:16:21.306 --> 02:16:24.042
OF THIS TECHNOLOGY, AI IS ONLY

02:16:24.109 --> 02:16:25.911
AS STRONG AS ITS WEAKEST OUTPUT.

02:16:25.977 --> 02:16:27.178
WE ALL KNOW THESE SYSTEMS CAN

02:16:27.245 --> 02:16:28.446
GENERATE NONSENSE OR INCORRECT

02:16:28.513 --> 02:16:29.915
RESULTS IF LEFT UNCHECKED. IF

02:16:29.981 --> 02:16:32.050
WE'RE GOING TO RELY ON AI FOR

02:16:32.117 --> 02:16:33.285
ADVISING RECORDS OR EVEN

02:16:33.351 --> 02:16:34.886
PAYROLL, THEN OVERSIGHT BY

02:16:34.953 --> 02:16:36.521
SKILLED WORKERS IS ESSENTIAL.

02:16:36.588 --> 02:16:38.323
STAFF MUST BE GIVEN TIME AND

02:16:38.390 --> 02:16:40.292
AUTHORITY TO MONITOR THE

02:16:40.358 --> 02:16:41.026
TECHNOLOGY, IDENTIFY AND

02:16:41.092 --> 02:16:42.894
CORRECT ERRORS, AND IMPROVE ITS

02:16:42.961 --> 02:16:45.063
ACCURACY. BEFORE ANY DISCUSSION

02:16:45.130 --> 02:16:46.631
OF REPLACING HUMAN WORKER

02:16:46.698 --> 02:16:49.034
OCCURS, JOB DISPLACEMENT SHOULD

02:16:49.100 --> 02:16:50.201
BE HELD OFF UNTIL THIS

02:16:50.268 --> 02:16:51.403
TECHNOLOGY IS NOT ONLY PROVEN

02:16:51.469 --> 02:16:53.004
BUT ALSO RELIABLE, TESTED IN

02:16:53.071 --> 02:16:55.440
REAL CONDITIONS BY THE VERY

02:16:55.507 --> 02:16:56.141
WORKERS WHO UNDERSTAND THESE

02:16:56.207 --> 02:16:58.143
CONDITIONS BEST. WE CANNOT

02:16:58.209 --> 02:17:00.378
IGNORE THAT AI ADOPTION WILL

02:17:00.445 --> 02:17:01.379
COST DISRUPTION. SOME JOBS WILL

02:17:01.446 --> 02:17:03.582
CHANGE. SOME TASKS MAY BE

02:17:03.648 --> 02:17:05.383
AUTOMATED. THIS REASON WE CALL

02:17:05.450 --> 02:17:07.285
FOR A JUST TRANSITION.

02:17:07.352 --> 02:17:08.019
PROACTIVE STRATEGIES THAT HELP

02:17:08.086 --> 02:17:10.322
WORKERS ADAPT AND THRIVE. THAT

02:17:10.388 --> 02:17:12.257
INCLUDES SEVERANCE PROTECTIONS.

02:17:12.324 --> 02:17:14.159
IF JOBS ARE TO BE ELIMINATED,

02:17:14.225 --> 02:17:15.393
JUSTIFICATIONS MUST BE LAID OUT

02:17:15.460 --> 02:17:16.995
SO FAMILIES ARE NOT BLINDSIDED.

02:17:17.062 --> 02:17:19.531
PROFIT REINVESTMENT INCENTIVES

02:17:19.598 --> 02:17:20.165
THAT RETRAIN AND REDEPLOY STAFF

02:17:20.231 --> 02:17:22.500
INTO NEW ROLES CREATED BY AI

02:17:22.567 --> 02:17:24.035
AND SHORTER, MORE PRODUCTIVE

02:17:24.102 --> 02:17:26.538
WORK WEEKS AS WORKERS NAVIGATE

02:17:26.605 --> 02:17:27.172
RETRAINING AND DISRUPTION,

02:17:27.238 --> 02:17:29.908
ENSURING NO ONE IS LEFT BEHIND.

02:17:29.975 --> 02:17:32.510
LIKE THE CSU, THE STAFF ARE

02:17:32.577 --> 02:17:33.411
ALSO GENERATIONAL, WITH MANY OF

02:17:33.478 --> 02:17:34.980
THEM BEING GRADUATES OF THE

02:17:35.046 --> 02:17:37.449
VERY CAMPUSES THEY SERVE. WE

02:17:37.515 --> 02:17:39.317
KNOW THIS AI REVOLUTION WILL BE

02:17:39.384 --> 02:17:40.218
GENERATIONAL. THIS IS WHY WE

02:17:40.285 --> 02:17:41.653
STRESS OUR TECHNOLOGY

02:17:41.720 --> 02:17:42.954
COLLABORATION. OUR STAFF, OUR

02:17:43.021 --> 02:17:44.990
CSU STAFF ARE IN THE FOREFRONT

02:17:45.056 --> 02:17:46.324
OF INNOVATION. WE'RE THE ONES

02:17:46.391 --> 02:17:48.326
WHO MAKE IT WORK. BUT THE

02:17:48.393 --> 02:17:49.194
LESSON OF EVERY TECHNOLOGY

02:17:49.260 --> 02:17:51.162
REVOLUTION IS THIS PROGRESS IS

02:17:51.229 --> 02:17:52.931
ONLY PROGRESS. WHEN WORKERS AND

02:17:52.998 --> 02:17:54.599
COMMUNITIES ARE LIFTED UP WITH

02:17:54.666 --> 02:17:56.868
IT. IF THE CSU WANTS AI TO

02:17:56.935 --> 02:17:58.637
SUCCEED, THEN WORKERS MUST HAVE

02:17:58.703 --> 02:18:01.172
A PERMANENT SEAT AT THE TABLE

02:18:01.239 --> 02:18:02.273
TOGETHER THROUGH WORKER

02:18:02.340 --> 02:18:02.707
COUNCILS, NEGOTIATED

02:18:02.774 --> 02:18:04.342
PROTECTIONS, CLOSE SURVEILLANCE

02:18:04.409 --> 02:18:06.277
OF THE TECHNOLOGY AND JUST

02:18:06.344 --> 02:18:07.112
TRANSITION STRATEGIES, WE CAN

02:18:07.178 --> 02:18:09.114
BUILD AN AI FUTURE THAT

02:18:09.180 --> 02:18:10.615
STRENGTHENS OUR UNIVERSITY,

02:18:10.682 --> 02:18:11.950
RESPECTS OUR EMPLOYEES, AND

02:18:12.017 --> 02:18:13.485
TRULY SERVES CALIFORNIA'S

02:18:13.551 --> 02:18:14.886
STUDENTS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR

02:18:14.953 --> 02:18:16.021
TIME AND YOUR COMMITMENT TO

02:18:16.087 --> 02:18:17.255
ENSURING THAT CSU'S AI FUTURE

02:18:17.322 --> 02:18:20.125
IS A FAIR ONE. THANK YOU SO

02:18:20.191 --> 02:18:25.363
MUCH. WELCOME. THANK YOU. GOOD

02:18:25.430 --> 02:18:28.133
AFTERNOON, CHAIR FONG AND CHAIR

02:18:28.199 --> 02:18:28.967
BAUER-KAHAN AND MEMBERS. MY

02:18:29.034 --> 02:18:31.202
NAME IS KATIE AND I'M A STUDENT

02:18:31.269 --> 02:18:32.470
AT CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY,

02:18:32.537 --> 02:18:34.072
NORTHRIDGE. I ALSO HAVE THE

02:18:34.139 --> 02:18:36.141
HUMBLE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE AS

02:18:36.207 --> 02:18:37.375
THE VICE PRESIDENT OF SYSTEM

STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION. CCSA

02:18:41.346 --> 02:18:43.748
SERVES AS THE OFFICIAL VOICE OF

02:18:43.815 --> 02:18:45.817
THE OVER 460,000 STUDENTS IN

02:18:45.884 --> 02:18:48.019
THE CSU SYSTEM, AND I

02:18:48.086 --> 02:18:49.320
APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THIS TIME

02:18:49.387 --> 02:18:50.121
TO HOLD THIS HEARING AND

02:18:50.188 --> 02:18:52.424
ALLOWING ME TO SHARE HOW THE

02:18:52.490 --> 02:18:53.224
CSU'S ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

02:18:53.291 --> 02:18:54.259
EMPOWERED INITIATIVE IS

02:18:54.325 --> 02:18:56.995
IMPACTING OUR STUDENTS. I WANT

02:18:57.062 --> 02:18:59.164
TO BEGIN BY RECOGNIZING THE

02:18:59.230 --> 02:18:59.864
OPPORTUNITIES THAT THIS

02:18:59.931 --> 02:19:01.166
INITIATIVE CREATES. THE LAUNCH

02:19:01.232 --> 02:19:03.868
OF CHATGPT EDU REPRESENTS AN

02:19:03.935 --> 02:19:05.070
INNOVATIVE MILESTONE FOR THE

02:19:05.136 --> 02:19:07.505
CSU AND WILL BE HIGHLY

02:19:07.572 --> 02:19:08.406
BENEFICIAL FOR STUDENTS BY

02:19:08.473 --> 02:19:11.042
IMPLEMENTING CHATGPT EDU

02:19:11.109 --> 02:19:12.010
SYSTEMWIDE, THE CSU IS ENSURING

02:19:12.077 --> 02:19:14.846
THAT ALL STUDENTS, REGARDLESS

02:19:14.913 --> 02:19:16.047
OF CAMPUS RESOURCES, BENEFIT

02:19:16.114 --> 02:19:18.016
FROM CUTTING EDGE AI TECHNOLOGY

02:19:18.083 --> 02:19:20.385
THAT ENHANCES BOTH ACADEMIC AND

02:19:20.452 --> 02:19:21.653
PROFESSIONAL SUCCESS. WITHOUT

02:19:21.720 --> 02:19:23.421
THIS SYSTEM WIDE INITIATIVE,

02:19:23.488 --> 02:19:25.090
ACCESS WOULD BE LIMITED FOR

02:19:25.156 --> 02:19:26.291
STUDENTS AT CAMPUSES UNABLE TO

02:19:26.357 --> 02:19:28.460
AFFORD INDIVIDUAL LICENSES,

02:19:28.526 --> 02:19:30.128
CREATING DISPARITIES IN

02:19:30.195 --> 02:19:30.829
OPPORTUNITY THAT THIS

02:19:30.895 --> 02:19:32.063
INITIATIVE IS AIMING TO

02:19:32.130 --> 02:19:34.199
ELIMINATE. THIS SYSTEM WIDE

02:19:34.265 --> 02:19:35.333
APPROACH ENSURES THAT EVERY

02:19:35.400 --> 02:19:37.068
STUDENT, REGARDLESS OF WHICH

02:19:37.135 --> 02:19:39.104
CSU CAMPUS THEY ATTEND, HAS

02:19:39.170 --> 02:19:41.339
EQUAL ACCESS TO THE AI TOOLS

02:19:41.406 --> 02:19:41.940
AND EXPERIENCES NECESSARY TO

02:19:42.006 --> 02:19:44.109
THRIVE IN A RAPIDLY CHANGING

02:19:44.175 --> 02:19:46.077
DIGITAL WORLD. THROUGH A CALL

02:19:46.144 --> 02:19:48.213
FOR FACULTY PROPOSALS AND A $3

02:19:48.279 --> 02:19:49.848
MILLION IN GRANTS TO SUPPORT

02:19:49.914 --> 02:19:52.117
ETHICAL AND CREATIVE AI IN THE

02:19:52.183 --> 02:19:54.385
CLASSROOM, THE CSU HAS SHOWN

02:19:54.452 --> 02:19:55.420
ITS COMMITMENT TO PREPARING

02:19:55.487 --> 02:19:56.654
STUDENTS FOR A RAPIDLY EVOLVING

02:19:56.721 --> 02:19:58.123
DIGITAL LANDSCAPE, WHICH IS

02:19:58.189 --> 02:20:01.059
IMPERATIVE STUDENTS CANNOT

02:20:01.126 --> 02:20:03.194
AFFORD TO BE LEFT BEHIND AS AI

02:20:03.261 --> 02:20:04.996
RESHAPES THE WORKFORCE. SO THIS

02:20:05.063 --> 02:20:06.097
INITIATIVE HELPS TO ENSURE THAT

02:20:06.164 --> 02:20:07.899
CSU STUDENTS ARE READY TO

02:20:07.966 --> 02:20:10.435
SUCCEED IN THEIR CHOSEN FIELDS

02:20:10.502 --> 02:20:11.202
POST-GRADUATION. WITH THAT

02:20:11.269 --> 02:20:12.937
BEING SAID, STUDENTS ARE

02:20:13.004 --> 02:20:14.172
EXPERIENCING EVER GROWING

02:20:14.239 --> 02:20:15.373
CHALLENGES AND VOICING THEIR

02:20:15.440 --> 02:20:17.375
CONCERNS WHEN IT COMES TO THE

02:20:17.442 --> 02:20:19.144
ROLLOUT OF THIS INITIATIVE. IT

02:20:19.210 --> 02:20:21.346
IS GREAT TO HEAR THAT 93,000

02:20:21.412 --> 02:20:22.981
ACCOUNTS FOR CHATGPT EDU HAVE

02:20:23.047 --> 02:20:24.883
BEEN ACTIVATED. HOWEVER, THERE

02:20:24.949 --> 02:20:25.950
ARE VALID CONCERNS ABOUT HOW

02:20:26.017 --> 02:20:27.218
MANY OF THESE ACCOUNT HOLDERS

02:20:27.285 --> 02:20:29.187
WILL ACTUALLY COMPLETE THE AI

02:20:29.254 --> 02:20:31.189
TRAINING NEEDED TO USE THE TOOL,

02:20:31.256 --> 02:20:32.257
EFFECTIVELY ENSURING THAT

02:20:32.323 --> 02:20:34.959
STUDENTS, FACULTY AND STAFF NOT

02:20:35.026 --> 02:20:36.227
ONLY HAVE ACCESS BUT ALSO THE

02:20:36.294 --> 02:20:37.962
KNOWLEDGE TO INTEGRATE AI INTO

02:20:38.029 --> 02:20:40.131
THEIR LEARNING AND WORKFLOWS,

02:20:40.198 --> 02:20:41.733
WILL BE CRITICAL TO REALIZING

02:20:41.800 --> 02:20:42.801
THE FULL BENEFITS OF THIS

02:20:42.867 --> 02:20:44.869
SYSTEM WIDE INITIATIVE. MOST

02:20:44.936 --> 02:20:46.337
IMPORTANTLY, STAFF AND FACULTY

02:20:46.404 --> 02:20:47.505
ARE BEING PROPERLY TRAINED ON

02:20:47.572 --> 02:20:48.907
THIS COULD DIRECTLY INFLUENCE

02:20:48.973 --> 02:20:50.241
STUDENT SUCCESS INSIDE AND

02:20:50.308 --> 02:20:52.277
OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM. WHILE

02:20:52.343 --> 02:20:53.044
THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE HAS

02:20:53.111 --> 02:20:55.079
BEGUN PROVIDING SYSTEM WIDE

02:20:55.146 --> 02:20:56.381
RESOURCES, STUDENTS ARE

02:20:56.447 --> 02:20:57.148
INCREASINGLY CONCERNED ABOUT

02:20:57.215 --> 02:20:59.083
HOW THESE SUPPORTS WILL

02:20:59.150 --> 02:20:59.818
TRANSLATE INTO MEANINGFUL

02:20:59.884 --> 02:21:01.753
IMPLEMENTATION AT THE CAMPUS

02:21:01.820 --> 02:21:03.087
LEVEL. WE APPRECIATE THE

02:21:03.154 --> 02:21:04.923
CHATGPT CAMPUS AMBASSADOR

02:21:04.989 --> 02:21:06.925
PROGRAM. HOWEVER, IT IS

02:21:06.991 --> 02:21:08.493
IMPORTANT THAT THE PROMOTION OF

02:21:08.560 --> 02:21:09.894
OPEN AI RESOURCES DOES NOT FALL

02:21:09.961 --> 02:21:12.330
SOLELY ON THESE STUDENTS TO

02:21:12.397 --> 02:21:14.132
ENSURE FULL ACCESSIBILITY AND

02:21:14.199 --> 02:21:14.933
TRANSPARENCY, THESE RESOURCES

02:21:14.999 --> 02:21:16.234
SHOULD BE EMBEDDED WITHIN THE

02:21:16.301 --> 02:21:18.436
PROGRAMS AND SUPPORT SERVICES

02:21:18.503 --> 02:21:20.338
OF EACH CSU CAMPUS. SOME

02:21:20.405 --> 02:21:22.040
PROFESSORS OPENLY ENCOURAGE AI

02:21:22.106 --> 02:21:23.141
LITERACY AND INTEGRATION WITHIN

02:21:23.208 --> 02:21:25.176
THEIR CLASSROOMS, WHILE OTHERS

02:21:25.243 --> 02:21:26.678
PENALIZE STUDENTS UNDER

02:21:26.744 --> 02:21:29.280
SUSPICION OF AI USE. THEY DO

02:21:29.347 --> 02:21:30.615
THIS THROUGH THE UTILIZATION OF

02:21:30.682 --> 02:21:32.183
AI DETECTION TOOLS THAT HAVE

02:21:32.250 --> 02:21:34.052
BEEN DEEMED UNRELIABLE. IN SOME

02:21:34.118 --> 02:21:36.087
CASES, STUDENTS HAVE EVEN FACED

02:21:36.154 --> 02:21:38.556
MASS ACCUSATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE,

02:21:38.623 --> 02:21:39.190
ONE PROFESSOR REPORTEDLY TURNED

02:21:39.257 --> 02:21:41.926
IN 50 STUDENTS FOR ALLEGED AI

02:21:41.993 --> 02:21:44.696
USAGE. MANY STUDENTS WORRIED

02:21:44.762 --> 02:21:45.530
THAT THEIR ACADEMIC CREDIBILITY

02:21:45.597 --> 02:21:47.999
MAY BE TAINTED IF PROFESSORS

02:21:48.066 --> 02:21:49.267
ASSUME THAT ANY PUBLISHED WORK

02:21:49.334 --> 02:21:51.135
MUST COME FROM AI. THIS ALSO

02:21:51.202 --> 02:21:53.271
AFFECTS THEIR TIME TO GRADUATE,

02:21:53.338 --> 02:21:54.105
AS SEVERAL STUDENTS HAVE

02:21:54.172 --> 02:21:56.274
RECEIVED ZEROS ON ASSIGNMENTS

02:21:56.341 --> 02:21:57.976
DUE TO AI DETECTION. WHETHER

02:21:58.042 --> 02:21:59.277
THE DETECTION OF AI IS FALSE OR

02:21:59.344 --> 02:22:02.146
ACCURATE, SOME FACULTY HAVE

02:22:02.213 --> 02:22:03.214
SHIFTED AWAY FROM WRITTEN

02:22:03.281 --> 02:22:03.948
ASSIGNMENTS TO ORAL

02:22:04.015 --> 02:22:05.116
PRESENTATIONS OR OTHER FORMATS.

02:22:05.183 --> 02:22:08.119
TO AVOID ANY AI CONCERNS, WE

02:22:08.186 --> 02:22:10.221
ENCOURAGE FACULTY TO EMBRACE

02:22:10.288 --> 02:22:11.022
MULTIPLE TEACHING MODALITIES

02:22:11.089 --> 02:22:12.891
THAT REFLECT THE DIVERSE WAYS

02:22:12.957 --> 02:22:14.993
STUDENTS LEARN BEST. HOWEVER,

02:22:15.059 --> 02:22:16.828
WE ALSO BELIEVE THIS APPROACH

02:22:16.895 --> 02:22:17.962
SHOULD EXTEND TO THE WAY

02:22:18.029 --> 02:22:20.031
STUDENTS KNOWLEDGE IS ASSESSED.

02:22:20.098 --> 02:22:21.299
CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENTS MUST BE

02:22:21.366 --> 02:22:23.034
CURATED AS SAFE SPACES, WHERE

02:22:23.101 --> 02:22:25.103
STUDENTS CAN FOCUS ON RETAINING

02:22:25.169 --> 02:22:26.738
KNOWLEDGE AND DEMONSTRATING

02:22:26.804 --> 02:22:27.939
THEIR LEARNING, RATHER THAN

02:22:28.006 --> 02:22:29.173
FEELING AS THOUGH THEY MAY BE

02:22:29.240 --> 02:22:32.577
PENALIZED AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT.

02:22:32.644 --> 02:22:33.044
OVERALL, THIS KIND OF

02:22:33.111 --> 02:22:34.545
INCONSISTENCY LEAVES STUDENTS

02:22:34.612 --> 02:22:35.813
UNCERTAIN. ARE WE ALLOWED TO

02:22:35.880 --> 02:22:38.049
USE AI OR NOT? WHAT COUNTS AS

02:22:38.116 --> 02:22:40.251
ETHICAL USE? THESE TYPES OF

02:22:40.318 --> 02:22:41.352
INCONSISTENCIES WITHIN THE

02:22:41.419 --> 02:22:43.021
CLASSROOM WHEN IT COMES TO THE

02:22:43.087 --> 02:22:45.490
USAGE OF AI ARE NOT SUSTAINABLE,

02:22:45.556 --> 02:22:46.157
AND STUDENTS HAVE GROWING

02:22:46.224 --> 02:22:47.358
CONCERNS ON HOW THIS INITIATIVE

02:22:47.425 --> 02:22:48.359
WILL ALLEVIATE THOSE

02:22:48.426 --> 02:22:49.394
INCONSISTENCIES OR EXACERBATE

02:22:49.460 --> 02:22:52.363
THEM. STUDENTS ALSO HAVE

02:22:52.430 --> 02:22:52.964
CONCERNS ABOUT DATA PRIVACY.

02:22:53.031 --> 02:22:55.066
WHILE WE WERE TOLD THAT CHATGPT

02:22:55.133 --> 02:22:57.101
KEEPS OUR DATA PRIVATE AND WILL

02:22:57.168 --> 02:22:58.036
NOT BE MADE AVAILABLE TO OTHERS,

02:22:58.102 --> 02:22:59.971
STUDENTS STILL HAVE QUESTIONS.

02:23:00.038 --> 02:23:01.272
WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT

02:23:01.339 --> 02:23:02.840
PROTECTIONS EXIST FOR OUR

02:23:02.907 --> 02:23:04.142
CONVERSATIONS, ASSIGNMENTS AND

02:23:04.208 --> 02:23:06.244
PERSONAL DATA. WHAT HAPPENS

02:23:06.311 --> 02:23:08.046
AFTER THE CONTRACT EXPIRES?

02:23:08.112 --> 02:23:10.415
WILL OUR DATA BE RETAINED,

02:23:10.481 --> 02:23:12.150
TRANSFERRED, OR SUBJECT IN

02:23:12.216 --> 02:23:13.117
RENEGOTIATION? WHO IS

02:23:13.184 --> 02:23:14.252
RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING

02:23:14.319 --> 02:23:16.154
COMPLIANCE WITH DATA

02:23:16.220 --> 02:23:17.221
PROTECTIONS? THE CHANCELLOR'S

02:23:17.288 --> 02:23:19.424
OFFICE OR INDIVIDUAL CAMPUSES?

02:23:19.490 --> 02:23:21.926
STUDENTS WANT CLEAR, ACCESSIBLE

02:23:21.993 --> 02:23:24.495
INFORMATION ON AI DATA POLICIES

02:23:24.562 --> 02:23:25.897
IN PLAIN LANGUAGE, NOT JUST IN

02:23:25.964 --> 02:23:27.465
LEGAL TERMS. BURIED IN

02:23:27.532 --> 02:23:29.867
CONTRACTS. MANY STUDENTS AT THE

02:23:29.934 --> 02:23:32.036
CSU ARE VERY CONSCIOUS OF THE

02:23:32.103 --> 02:23:33.171
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS THAT AI

02:23:33.237 --> 02:23:35.306
HAS. TRAINING AND RUNNING AI

02:23:35.373 --> 02:23:36.207
REQUIRES SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF

02:23:36.274 --> 02:23:37.942
ENERGY AND WATER, RAISING

02:23:38.009 --> 02:23:39.477
QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW MUCH OF

02:23:39.544 --> 02:23:40.645
THESE RESOURCES ARE BEING

02:23:40.712 --> 02:23:42.213
CONSUMED TO SUPPORT AI ACROSS

02:23:42.280 --> 02:23:45.249
THE CSU SYSTEM, AND WHAT THE

02:23:45.316 --> 02:23:46.651
IMPLICATIONS ARE FOR THE CSU'S

02:23:46.718 --> 02:23:48.252
BROADER SUSTAINABILITY GOALS.

02:23:48.319 --> 02:23:50.555
AS CLIMATE CHANGE INTENSIFIES

02:23:50.621 --> 02:23:52.156
AND CALIFORNIA FACES INCREASING

02:23:52.223 --> 02:23:53.958
PRESSURES ON ITS WATERS AND

02:23:54.025 --> 02:23:55.326
ENERGY SYSTEMS, IT IS IMPORTANT

02:23:55.393 --> 02:23:56.894
TO WEIGH THE ENVIRONMENTAL

02:23:56.961 --> 02:23:57.962
TRADEOFFS OF ADOPTING AI

02:23:58.029 --> 02:24:00.231
TECHNOLOGY. SYSTEMWIDE AI

02:24:00.298 --> 02:24:01.399
ADOPTION SHOULD NOT BE

02:24:01.466 --> 02:24:03.301
CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION FROM

02:24:03.368 --> 02:24:04.002
THE CSU'S EXISTING

02:24:04.068 --> 02:24:05.303
SUSTAINABILITY COMMITMENTS,

02:24:05.370 --> 02:24:07.005
INCLUDING ITS CLIMATE ACTION

02:24:07.071 --> 02:24:09.107
PLAN AND CARBON NEUTRALITY

02:24:09.173 --> 02:24:10.274
TARGETS. IF THE CSU IS

02:24:10.341 --> 02:24:11.542
INVESTING IN TECHNOLOGIES THAT

02:24:11.609 --> 02:24:12.243
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE ENERGY

02:24:12.310 --> 02:24:14.178
AND WATER CONSUMPTION, THIS

02:24:14.245 --> 02:24:15.079
COULD DIRECTLY CONFLICT WITH

02:24:15.146 --> 02:24:17.415
ITS GOALS OF REDUCING

02:24:17.482 --> 02:24:18.249
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND

02:24:18.316 --> 02:24:19.550
BUILDING A MORE SUSTAINABLE

02:24:19.617 --> 02:24:21.219
FUTURE, WHICH ARE ALL AREAS OF

02:24:21.285 --> 02:24:22.854
CONCERNS THAT OUR STUDENTS FEEL

02:24:22.920 --> 02:24:24.122
STRONGLY ABOUT. STUDENTS URGE

02:24:24.188 --> 02:24:26.324
THE CSU TO REPORT ON THE CARBON,

02:24:26.391 --> 02:24:28.826
ENERGY AND WATER FOOTPRINT OF

02:24:28.893 --> 02:24:29.660
THE AI TOOLS BEING USED

02:24:29.727 --> 02:24:32.830
SYSTEMWIDE. THE CSU'S AI

02:24:32.897 --> 02:24:33.998
INITIATIVE IS AMBITIOUS AND

02:24:34.065 --> 02:24:35.366
INNOVATIVE, AND STUDENTS WANT

02:24:35.433 --> 02:24:38.269
TO BE A PART OF SHAPING IT. I'M

02:24:38.336 --> 02:24:39.504
PROUD TO SERVE ON THE CSU

02:24:39.570 --> 02:24:40.438
GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL

02:24:40.505 --> 02:24:41.005
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE THIS

02:24:41.072 --> 02:24:42.106
YEAR, AND I HOPE TO CONTINUE

02:24:42.173 --> 02:24:43.341
SHARING THE STUDENT PERSPECTIVE

02:24:43.408 --> 02:24:45.176
IN THAT SPACE AS WE SHAPE

02:24:45.243 --> 02:24:47.278
SYSTEMWIDE AI POLICIES.

02:24:47.345 --> 02:24:49.080
LEGISLATURES. AS YOU CONTINUE

02:24:49.147 --> 02:24:50.882
TO EXAMINE THIS ISSUE, I URGE

02:24:50.948 --> 02:24:52.550
YOU TO HOLD CSU LEADERSHIP

02:24:52.617 --> 02:24:53.818
ACCOUNTABLE TO ENSURE

02:24:53.885 --> 02:24:56.921
CONSISTENT, TRANSPARENT CAMPUS

02:24:56.988 --> 02:24:58.122
POLICIES, CLEAR SAFEGUARDS FOR

02:24:58.189 --> 02:25:00.158
STUDENT PRIVACY, AND DATA

02:25:00.224 --> 02:25:02.026
ASSESSMENTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL

02:25:02.093 --> 02:25:03.628
AND ETHICAL IMPACTS, AND, ABOVE

02:25:03.694 --> 02:25:04.996
ALL, MEANINGFUL STUDENT INPUT

02:25:05.063 --> 02:25:06.130
AT EVERY STAGE OF

02:25:06.197 --> 02:25:08.733
IMPLEMENTATION. WITHOUT CLEAR

02:25:08.800 --> 02:25:09.367
GUIDANCE FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S

02:25:09.434 --> 02:25:11.402
OFFICE AND WITH CAMPUSES LEFT

02:25:11.469 --> 02:25:12.804
TO ACT INDEPENDENTLY, STUDENTS

02:25:12.870 --> 02:25:14.138
WILL SHOULDER THE BURDEN OF

02:25:14.205 --> 02:25:16.107
NAVIGATING HOW TO IMPLEMENT

02:25:16.174 --> 02:25:17.375
THIS INITIATIVE. WHILE SYSTEM

02:25:17.442 --> 02:25:18.910
WIDE PERSPECTIVES ON AI REMAIN

02:25:18.976 --> 02:25:21.145
FRAGMENTED, IT'S IMPERATIVE TO

02:25:21.212 --> 02:25:22.080
PROPERLY ASSESS THIS INITIATIVE

02:25:22.146 --> 02:25:24.449
IN WAYS THAT DO NOT PUT

02:25:24.515 --> 02:25:25.716
STUDENTS AT THE CROSSROADS OF

02:25:25.783 --> 02:25:27.018
THE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS. THE

02:25:27.085 --> 02:25:29.187
CSU FACES A DEFINING CHOICE

02:25:29.253 --> 02:25:30.988
WILL WE BE AI POWERED OR TRULY

02:25:31.055 --> 02:25:34.125
AI EMPOWERED? THE DIFFERENCE IS

02:25:34.192 --> 02:25:35.893
SEISMIC. IF THE CSU AND THE

02:25:35.960 --> 02:25:37.161
LEGISLATURE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT

02:25:37.228 --> 02:25:37.995
HARNESSING ARTIFICIAL

02:25:38.062 --> 02:25:39.163
INTELLIGENCE, THEY MUST

02:25:39.230 --> 02:25:40.098
DELIBERATELY INVEST IN FUNDING

02:25:40.164 --> 02:25:42.033
THAT DRIVES STUDENT

02:25:42.100 --> 02:25:43.501
OPPORTUNITIES, NOT JUST THE

02:25:43.568 --> 02:25:45.970
CONTRACT WITH OPENAI. THIS

02:25:46.037 --> 02:25:47.238
INITIATIVE COULD RESHAPE HIGHER

02:25:47.305 --> 02:25:48.739
EDUCATION AS WE KNOW IT, BUT

02:25:48.806 --> 02:25:49.974
THAT TRANSFORMATION WILL ONLY

02:25:50.041 --> 02:25:51.242
HAPPEN IF STUDENTS ARE AT THE

02:25:51.309 --> 02:25:52.910
CENTER EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. I

02:25:52.977 --> 02:25:54.112
WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HOLDING

02:25:54.178 --> 02:25:56.114
THIS HEARING AND FOR CENTERING

02:25:56.180 --> 02:25:56.814
STUDENT VOICES IN THIS

02:25:56.881 --> 02:25:58.583
CONVERSATION, AND I'M HAPPY TO

02:25:58.649 --> 02:25:59.183
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU

02:25:59.250 --> 02:26:01.119
MAY HAVE. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

02:26:01.185 --> 02:26:02.386
AND THANK YOU TO EACH AND EVERY

02:26:02.453 --> 02:26:04.155
ONE OF YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY.

02:26:04.222 --> 02:26:05.156
POWERFUL INSIGHTS HERE TODAY.

02:26:05.223 --> 02:26:07.024
ACTUALLY, WE'LL START WITH OUR

02:26:07.091 --> 02:26:09.460
CSA REP. THANK YOU FOR YOUR

02:26:09.527 --> 02:26:10.661
TESTIMONY. YOU MENTIONED IN

02:26:10.728 --> 02:26:11.896
YOUR COMMENTS THAT THERE NEEDS

02:26:11.963 --> 02:26:14.499
TO BE ADDITIONAL TRAINING, THAT

02:26:14.565 --> 02:26:16.300
NEEDS ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS, AND

02:26:16.367 --> 02:26:17.969
ALSO USING AI AND ETHICAL

02:26:18.035 --> 02:26:19.437
MANNER TO SUPPORT YOUR

02:26:19.504 --> 02:26:21.973
EDUCATION. HAS CSU, IN THE

02:26:22.039 --> 02:26:24.509
MONTHS THAT YOU'VE BEEN ON THIS

02:26:24.575 --> 02:26:25.910
WORKFORCE ACCELERATION BOARD,

02:26:25.977 --> 02:26:28.446
HAVE THERE BEEN ADDITIONAL

02:26:28.513 --> 02:26:29.013
CONSULTATIONS AND DO YOU SEE

02:26:29.080 --> 02:26:29.947
ADDITIONAL PROGRESS IN THIS

02:26:30.014 --> 02:26:33.050
SPACE? IN THE TRAINING ASPECT,

02:26:33.117 --> 02:26:34.819
TRAINING ASPECT, AND YOUR

02:26:34.886 --> 02:26:37.388
INVOLVEMENT ALSO WITH THE

02:26:37.455 --> 02:26:38.489
WORKFORCE ACCELERATION BOARD?

02:26:38.556 --> 02:26:39.891
ABSOLUTELY, YEAH, I JUST

02:26:39.957 --> 02:26:41.092
RECENTLY GOT APPOINTED TO THAT

02:26:41.159 --> 02:26:43.261
COMMITTEE WITHIN THE LAST MONTH

02:26:43.327 --> 02:26:46.164
OR SO. BUT REALLY THE FOCUS

02:26:46.230 --> 02:26:48.966
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE HAS BEEN ON

02:26:49.033 --> 02:26:51.068
POLICY AND SETTING METRICS AS

02:26:51.135 --> 02:26:52.937
OPPOSED TO PUSHING TRAINING OR

02:26:53.004 --> 02:26:54.172
MAKING SURE TRAINING IS GOING

02:26:54.238 --> 02:26:56.207
WELL. AGAIN, FROM THE

02:26:56.274 --> 02:26:56.974
PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT I'VE SEEN

02:26:57.041 --> 02:26:59.610
IN THE COMMITTEE SO FAR. SO I

02:26:59.677 --> 02:27:00.811
THINK IT'S BEEN MORE

02:27:00.878 --> 02:27:03.047
FOUNDATIONAL WORK. SO IN TERMS

02:27:03.114 --> 02:27:04.515
OF THAT FOUNDATIONAL WORK AND

02:27:04.582 --> 02:27:06.017
AND THE POLICIES THAT ARE BEING

02:27:06.083 --> 02:27:08.553
WORKED ON, WHAT MORE CAN BE

02:27:08.619 --> 02:27:09.820
DONE TO SUPPORT CSA? I KNOW YOU

02:27:09.887 --> 02:27:11.055
MENTIONED A NUMBER OF THEM IN

02:27:11.122 --> 02:27:13.124
YOUR REMARKS. I MEAN, I THINK,

02:27:13.191 --> 02:27:14.458
I THINK IT REALLY IS JUST MORE

02:27:14.525 --> 02:27:15.960
STUDENT INVOLVEMENT IN POLICY

02:27:16.027 --> 02:27:19.497
MAKING AND MORE SYSTEMNESS. I

02:27:19.564 --> 02:27:21.098
THINK SOMETHING THAT I THINK

02:27:21.165 --> 02:27:22.800
THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE DOES

02:27:22.867 --> 02:27:24.168
WELL AND CAN BE INTERPRETED

02:27:24.235 --> 02:27:27.104
WELL FROM CAMPUSES IS ALLOWING

02:27:27.171 --> 02:27:28.272
AUTONOMY FOR CAMPUSES TO

02:27:28.339 --> 02:27:29.073
OPERATE HOW THEY WILL, BECAUSE

02:27:29.140 --> 02:27:31.609
THEY KNOW THEIR STUDENTS BETTER

02:27:31.676 --> 02:27:32.476
THAN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE

02:27:32.543 --> 02:27:35.079
WILL. AND I THINK WITH WITH

02:27:35.146 --> 02:27:36.280
SOMETHING LIKE THIS, THERE'S

02:27:36.347 --> 02:27:39.016
THIS IDEA OF THERE BEING, YOU

02:27:39.083 --> 02:27:41.385
KNOW, LET, LET LET THE CAMPUSES

02:27:41.452 --> 02:27:42.920
KIND OF, YOU KNOW, FIGURE OUT

02:27:42.987 --> 02:27:45.156
HOW THEY WANT TO ROLL OUT THE

02:27:45.223 --> 02:27:47.258
AI WITH THEIR STUDENTS. BUT I

02:27:47.325 --> 02:27:49.627
THINK THAT WILL INHERENTLY

02:27:49.694 --> 02:27:51.896
CREATE SOME INEQUITIES IF WE'RE

02:27:51.963 --> 02:27:53.197
HAVING CAMPUSES THAT ARE BEING

02:27:53.264 --> 02:27:54.966
MORE FORWARD WITH THEIR FACULTY

02:27:55.032 --> 02:27:56.601
ABOUT TRAINING STUDENTS AND

02:27:56.667 --> 02:27:59.270
FACULTY ON AI, ETHICAL USE AND

02:27:59.337 --> 02:28:01.138
JUST PROPER USAGE VERSUS OTHER

02:28:01.205 --> 02:28:02.974
CAMPUSES. NOT SO. I THINK

02:28:03.040 --> 02:28:05.343
ENCOURAGING THAT TO THE

02:28:05.409 --> 02:28:06.877
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND TO

02:28:06.944 --> 02:28:08.846
CAMPUSES IN GENERAL IS GOING TO

02:28:08.913 --> 02:28:11.115
BE VERY IMPERATIVE. YEAH, GREAT.

02:28:11.182 --> 02:28:12.283
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR

02:28:12.350 --> 02:28:13.417
COMMENTS THERE. AND TO THE

02:28:13.484 --> 02:28:15.419
ACADEMIC SENATE, YOU MENTIONED

02:28:15.486 --> 02:28:16.187
ALSO THE REPRESENTATION ON THE

02:28:16.254 --> 02:28:18.322
WORKFORCE ACCELERATION BOARD IN

02:28:18.389 --> 02:28:19.991
THE COMMENTS HERE. AND AS THE

02:28:20.057 --> 02:28:21.459
BOARD IS MEETING MORE REGULARLY,

02:28:21.525 --> 02:28:23.261
ARE YOU MORE FULLY INCLUDED IN

02:28:23.327 --> 02:28:24.228
THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND SHAPING

02:28:24.295 --> 02:28:26.264
THOSE POLICIES AS WELL? AND

02:28:26.330 --> 02:28:27.999
WHAT MORE CAN BE DONE THERE?

02:28:28.065 --> 02:28:31.936
YEAH. SO I, I HAVE AS A CHAIR

02:28:32.003 --> 02:28:34.171
OF THE ASU, I FEEL I'VE BEEN

02:28:34.238 --> 02:28:36.907
VERY, VERY INCLUDED SINCE THE

02:28:36.974 --> 02:28:39.677
DEVELOPMENT OF IT, SINCE IT'S

02:28:39.744 --> 02:28:43.581
BEEN SINCE THE, SINCE THE BOARD

02:28:43.648 --> 02:28:45.182
HAS BEEN MEETING, I'VE BEEN

02:28:45.249 --> 02:28:47.318
ABLE TO BE AT EACH MEETING.

02:28:47.385 --> 02:28:48.252
THERE ARE SUBGROUPS THAT ARE

02:28:48.319 --> 02:28:50.221
CURRENTLY WORKING. IN FACT,

02:28:50.288 --> 02:28:52.023
JUST THIS MORNING AT TEN, I WAS

02:28:52.089 --> 02:28:53.557
WORKING ON A SUBGROUP OF THE

02:28:53.624 --> 02:28:54.892
WORKFORCE ACCELERATION BOARD,

02:28:54.959 --> 02:28:59.196
AND WE'RE WORKING ON HOW DO WE

02:28:59.263 --> 02:29:01.999
SCALE THE WORK THAT WE NEED TO

02:29:02.066 --> 02:29:06.137
DO. MUCH OF THE EXAMPLES THAT

02:29:06.203 --> 02:29:07.872
VICE PRESIDENT KAREN MENTIONED,

02:29:07.938 --> 02:29:12.176
THE ONE OFFS WITH THE FACULTY

02:29:12.243 --> 02:29:14.111
AND HOW THEY'RE UTILIZING AI IN

02:29:14.178 --> 02:29:16.747
THE CLASSROOM OR NOT, AND HOW

02:29:16.814 --> 02:29:17.948
IT'S BEING INTERPRETED. IT'S

02:29:18.015 --> 02:29:20.184
CRITICAL THAT WE HAVE AN

02:29:20.251 --> 02:29:21.886
EDUCATED WORKFORCE IN THE CSU

02:29:21.952 --> 02:29:25.823
CURRENTLY, WHILE WE'RE ALL ALSO

02:29:25.890 --> 02:29:28.959
TRYING TO EDUCATE OUR WORKFORCE

02:29:29.026 --> 02:29:29.994
IN STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT TO

02:29:30.061 --> 02:29:32.296
YOUR TO YOUR POINT, I DO FEEL

02:29:32.363 --> 02:29:34.165
THAT THERE'S BEEN INVOLVEMENT

02:29:34.231 --> 02:29:36.200
IN TERMS OF WHAT WE COULD DO

02:29:36.267 --> 02:29:39.170
BETTER. I WOULD SAY IT MIGHT BE

02:29:39.236 --> 02:29:41.672
USEFUL. AND I DO THINK THERE'S

02:29:41.739 --> 02:29:44.975
AN OPENNESS TO EXPAND THAT TO

02:29:45.042 --> 02:29:47.812
FACULTY WITH SPECIFIC SKILL

02:29:47.878 --> 02:29:50.014
SETS, AS THEY HAVE BEEN DOING

02:29:50.081 --> 02:29:51.215
WITH THE GENERATIVE AI

02:29:51.282 --> 02:29:53.484
COMMITTEE THAT HAS BEEN VERY

02:29:53.551 --> 02:29:55.686
EXPANSIVE AND OPEN. I KNOW THAT

02:29:55.753 --> 02:29:56.921
THE WORKFORCE ONE HAS BEEN A

02:29:56.987 --> 02:29:58.255
LITTLE BIT MORE DIALED IN, BUT

02:29:58.322 --> 02:30:00.291
I DO THINK IT COULD BENEFIT

02:30:00.358 --> 02:30:01.992
FROM A FEW MORE VOICES THERE.

02:30:02.059 --> 02:30:03.327
THANK YOU FOR THAT CONTEXT.

02:30:03.394 --> 02:30:04.395
SOUNDS LIKE SOME ADDITIONAL

02:30:04.462 --> 02:30:05.930
VOICES ON THERE. ADDITIONAL

02:30:05.996 --> 02:30:07.665
REPRESENTATION TO MAKE SURE

02:30:07.732 --> 02:30:08.399
THAT ALL VOICES ARE BEING

02:30:08.466 --> 02:30:09.333
INCLUDED IN THIS PROCESS WOULD

02:30:09.400 --> 02:30:12.103
BE CRITICAL. THIS QUESTION IS

02:30:12.169 --> 02:30:14.238
FOR CFR. THANK YOU FOR THE

02:30:14.305 --> 02:30:15.940
CONTEXT HERE AS WELL. THANK YOU.

02:30:16.006 --> 02:30:18.242
WE KNOW THAT CFA FILED A FAIR

02:30:18.309 --> 02:30:19.443
PRACTICE CHARGE ALLEGING THAT

02:30:19.510 --> 02:30:22.179
THE CSU VIOLATED THE LAW DURING

02:30:22.246 --> 02:30:24.081
THE ROLLOUT OF THE INITIATIVE

02:30:24.148 --> 02:30:26.050
BY FAILING TO MEET AND CONFER.

02:30:26.117 --> 02:30:28.085
SINCE THEN, HAS THE CSU

02:30:28.152 --> 02:30:29.220
INCREASED THE CONSULTATION WITH

02:30:29.286 --> 02:30:31.822
CFA SINCE THAT ROLLOUT? NO, AND

02:30:31.889 --> 02:30:33.858
I THINK IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO

02:30:33.924 --> 02:30:35.226
BE MORE INVOLVED. AS I WAS

02:30:35.292 --> 02:30:39.997
LISTENING TO CCSA AND AND BETSY

02:30:40.064 --> 02:30:40.998
SPEAK AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR

02:30:41.065 --> 02:30:43.033
REMARKS. I SEE THIS AS AN

02:30:43.100 --> 02:30:45.202
OPPORTUNITY FOR CFA, CFA, TO BE

02:30:45.269 --> 02:30:48.406
A CONVENER OF FACULTY, TO HEAR

02:30:48.472 --> 02:30:52.309
ALL VOICES, TO HEAR ALL AREAS

02:30:52.376 --> 02:30:54.111
OF EXPERTISE, BECAUSE I THINK

02:30:54.178 --> 02:30:55.913
IT'S NOT JUST HAVING THE AI

02:30:55.980 --> 02:30:58.015
EXPERTISE, BUT WHAT DOES THAT

02:30:58.082 --> 02:30:59.817
LOOK LIKE IN SPECIFIC

02:30:59.884 --> 02:31:00.818
DISCIPLINES? WHAT DOES THAT

02:31:00.885 --> 02:31:02.720
LOOK LIKE? INTERDISCIPLINARY,

02:31:02.787 --> 02:31:05.322
RIGHT? I SAW IT IN MY OWN CLASS.

02:31:05.389 --> 02:31:07.758
I HAD A I HAD A STUDENT WHO WAS

02:31:07.825 --> 02:31:08.959
A DANCE MAJOR AND, AND, AND

02:31:09.026 --> 02:31:11.295
CAME UP WITH A FINAL PROJECT OF

02:31:11.362 --> 02:31:12.797
HERE'S HOW TO USE DANCE TO

02:31:12.863 --> 02:31:13.931
EXPLAIN HOW MOLECULES MOVE. I

02:31:13.998 --> 02:31:16.066
MEAN, HOW AMAZING IS THAT?

02:31:16.133 --> 02:31:17.435
RIGHT. SO BUT THAT'S JUST MY

02:31:17.501 --> 02:31:20.704
CLASSROOM, YOU KNOW, HOW DO WE

02:31:20.771 --> 02:31:21.839
COME TOGETHER, ESPECIALLY WITH

02:31:21.906 --> 02:31:24.675
CFA BEING A CONVENER WITH ALL

02:31:24.742 --> 02:31:26.310
OUR 29,000 MEMBERS. RIGHT. AND

02:31:26.377 --> 02:31:28.479
HEAR THAT FEEDBACK AND SEE HOW

02:31:28.546 --> 02:31:30.314
WE CAN BEST SERVE THE STUDENTS

02:31:30.381 --> 02:31:32.249
OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU SO

02:31:32.316 --> 02:31:34.251
MUCH. SOUNDS LIKE THE INCREASED

02:31:34.318 --> 02:31:35.586
CONSULTATION. THERE'S GOING TO

02:31:35.653 --> 02:31:36.921
BE A LOT MORE COMMUNICATION AND

02:31:36.987 --> 02:31:38.222
CONSULTATION GOING FORWARD. SO

02:31:38.289 --> 02:31:39.924
I APPRECIATE THE CONTEXT AND

02:31:39.990 --> 02:31:41.125
THE INSIGHTS THERE. THANK YOU.

02:31:41.192 --> 02:31:43.427
I'LL PASS IT OVER TO MY I'M

02:31:43.494 --> 02:31:47.097
SORRY, SAMIR PATEL. YES. THANK

02:31:47.164 --> 02:31:49.433
YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS AND

02:31:49.500 --> 02:31:50.201
YOUR THOUGHTFUL INSIGHTS. IT'S

02:31:50.267 --> 02:31:52.102
ALWAYS GOOD TO HEAR THE FULL

02:31:52.169 --> 02:31:53.304
STORY FROM MULTIPLE

02:31:53.370 --> 02:31:54.939
PERSPECTIVES. THAT HELPS US

02:31:55.005 --> 02:31:56.106
UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES A

02:31:56.173 --> 02:31:57.308
LITTLE BIT BETTER. I'M GOING TO

02:31:57.374 --> 02:31:58.976
GET BACK TO A QUESTION THAT I

02:31:59.043 --> 02:32:01.078
ASKED THE THE ADMINISTRATIVE

02:32:01.145 --> 02:32:04.014
LEVEL PANEL BEFORE. WHEN WE'RE

02:32:04.081 --> 02:32:06.450
LOOKING AT POLICIES

02:32:06.517 --> 02:32:07.852
SPECIFICALLY AROUND I USE

02:32:07.918 --> 02:32:10.154
POLICY. WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM

02:32:10.221 --> 02:32:11.689
SEVERAL STUDENTS IN MY DISTRICT

02:32:11.755 --> 02:32:13.557
IS THAT, AND NOT JUST FROM SAN

02:32:13.624 --> 02:32:15.626
MARCOS, CSUSM, BUT JUST SDSU

02:32:15.693 --> 02:32:17.528
AND STUDENTS THAT ATTEND OTHER

02:32:17.595 --> 02:32:19.163
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES

02:32:19.230 --> 02:32:23.300
AROUND THAT FACULTY DON'T

02:32:23.367 --> 02:32:25.936
ALWAYS HAVE AN I USE POLICY,

02:32:26.003 --> 02:32:28.639
BUT YET WILL HAVE A DISCIPLINE

02:32:28.706 --> 02:32:31.008
POLICY. AND SO WHAT STUDENTS

02:32:31.075 --> 02:32:33.110
ASK FOR IS, CAN EVERY FACULTY

02:32:33.177 --> 02:32:35.079
HAVE AN EIU'S POLICY, WHATEVER

02:32:35.145 --> 02:32:37.147
THAT MAY BE, AND JUST MAKE IT

02:32:37.214 --> 02:32:38.916
VERY, EXTREMELY TRANSPARENT SO

02:32:38.983 --> 02:32:40.117
THEY KNOW WHAT THEIR

02:32:40.184 --> 02:32:42.219
EXPECTATIONS ARE? IS THERE?

02:32:42.286 --> 02:32:45.055
FIRST OF ALL, IS, IS DOES THAT

02:32:45.122 --> 02:32:47.157
SOUND CONSISTENT WITH WHAT

02:32:47.224 --> 02:32:49.026
YOU'RE HEARING FROM YOUR PEERS?

02:32:49.093 --> 02:32:51.228
TOTALLY. TOTALLY. YEAH, I WOULD

02:32:51.295 --> 02:32:54.064
SAY I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF, AGAIN,

02:32:54.131 --> 02:32:55.633
FROM MY EXPERIENCE AS A STUDENT

02:32:55.699 --> 02:32:57.034
AND FROM MY EXPERIENCE SPEAKING

02:32:57.101 --> 02:32:59.803
WITH MY FELLOW STUDENTS,

02:32:59.870 --> 02:33:01.539
DISCIPLINE DEFINITELY RANGES

02:33:01.605 --> 02:33:03.274
DEPENDING ON THE PROFESSOR, AND

02:33:03.340 --> 02:33:05.843
THERE ISN'T A CLEAR POLICY THAT

02:33:05.910 --> 02:33:08.145
COMES OUT OF FACULTY AFFAIRS.

02:33:08.212 --> 02:33:12.016
AND I USED TO BE LIKE STUDENT

02:33:12.082 --> 02:33:13.183
BODY PRESIDENT AT CAL STATE

02:33:13.250 --> 02:33:14.385
NORTHRIDGE LAST YEAR, AND I

02:33:14.451 --> 02:33:15.286
WORKED VERY EXTENSIVELY WITH

02:33:15.352 --> 02:33:17.254
OUR FACULTY SENATE, AND THIS

02:33:17.321 --> 02:33:19.523
WAS STILL A THING THAT WAS

02:33:19.590 --> 02:33:19.990
COMING UP WHERE WE HAD

02:33:20.057 --> 02:33:22.126
PROFESSORS ON ONE END THAT WERE,

02:33:22.192 --> 02:33:22.893
AGAIN, VERY ENCOURAGING OF AI

02:33:22.960 --> 02:33:25.462
USAGE AND WERE INTEGRATING INTO

02:33:25.529 --> 02:33:26.163
THEIR COURSEWORK. AND THEN ON

02:33:26.230 --> 02:33:27.331
THE OTHER END, WE HAVE

02:33:27.398 --> 02:33:29.166
PROFESSORS THAT ARE I DON'T

02:33:29.233 --> 02:33:31.201
KNOW WHERE THEY GET THIS IDEA

02:33:31.268 --> 02:33:32.469
OF SAYING, LIKE, YOU KNOW, I'M

02:33:32.536 --> 02:33:34.371
GOING TO USE THESE THREE AI

02:33:34.438 --> 02:33:35.339
DETECTION TOOLS. AND IF ALL OF

02:33:35.406 --> 02:33:37.975
THEM GIVE ME ABOVE A 60% AI

02:33:38.042 --> 02:33:39.376
DETECTION THAT I'M GOING TO

02:33:39.443 --> 02:33:41.178
FAIL YOU ON THIS ASSIGNMENT. I

02:33:41.245 --> 02:33:42.079
DON'T REALLY KNOW WHERE IT

02:33:42.146 --> 02:33:44.048
COMES FROM, BUT I USE POLICY. I

02:33:44.114 --> 02:33:45.282
HAVEN'T SEEN IT, BUT I THINK

02:33:45.349 --> 02:33:47.217
THAT WOULD BE MUCH MORE

02:33:47.284 --> 02:33:50.120
EFFICIENT AND TRANSPARENT FOR

02:33:50.187 --> 02:33:51.922
OUR STUDENTS. AND CERTAINLY THE

02:33:51.989 --> 02:33:53.090
CHALLENGES WITH AI DETECTION

02:33:53.157 --> 02:33:56.193
TOOLS ARE IT FLAGS GOOD GRAMMAR

02:33:56.260 --> 02:33:58.195
OFTENTIMES, AND SOME STUDENTS

02:33:58.262 --> 02:33:59.730
JUST HAVE REALLY GOOD GRAMMAR,

02:33:59.797 --> 02:34:01.265
AND WE HOPE THAT THEY WOULD BY

02:34:01.332 --> 02:34:03.300
THE TIME THEY REACH UNIVERSITY

02:34:03.367 --> 02:34:04.368
LEVEL. AGREED. YEAH. AND

02:34:04.435 --> 02:34:05.903
SOMETIMES THOSE ALGORITHMS ARE

02:34:05.970 --> 02:34:07.905
AROUND GOOD GRAMMAR. YEAH. AND

02:34:07.972 --> 02:34:09.974
OUR STUDENTS ARE SMART. SO I

02:34:10.040 --> 02:34:12.543
DON'T BLAME THEM. YEAH, YEAH.

02:34:12.610 --> 02:34:13.877
AND SOMETIMES ALSO I'VE SEEN,

02:34:13.944 --> 02:34:15.145
HEARD STORIES FROM STUDENTS IN

02:34:15.212 --> 02:34:17.114
THE SYSTEM WHERE THEY'VE

02:34:17.181 --> 02:34:19.717
PRODUCED A NARRATIVE THAT IS

02:34:19.783 --> 02:34:21.251
VERY CREATIVE AND SOMETHING

02:34:21.318 --> 02:34:22.886
UNIQUE, AND IT'S BEEN FLAGGED

02:34:22.953 --> 02:34:24.254
AS BEING SOMETHING TOO CREATIVE

02:34:24.321 --> 02:34:26.256
AND UNIQUE, AND IT MUST HAVE

02:34:26.323 --> 02:34:28.092
COME FROM AI. AND SO THERE ARE

02:34:28.158 --> 02:34:29.259
DEFINITELY CHALLENGES AROUND

02:34:29.326 --> 02:34:31.161
THAT TO PROVE INNOCENCE, BUT

02:34:31.228 --> 02:34:34.031
ALSO JUST IN GENERAL TO THE

02:34:34.098 --> 02:34:35.899
FACULTY ON THE PANEL TODAY, IS

02:34:35.966 --> 02:34:38.402
THERE A POSSIBILITY TO GET TO A

02:34:38.469 --> 02:34:39.903
POINT WHERE ALL FACULTY ARE

02:34:39.970 --> 02:34:43.374
PROVIDING SOME KIND OF AI USE

02:34:43.440 --> 02:34:44.308
POLICY, JUST SO STUDENTS KNOW

02:34:44.375 --> 02:34:46.110
WHAT THE GROUND RULES ARE IN

02:34:46.176 --> 02:34:48.012
EACH CLASSROOM THAT THEY WALK

02:34:48.078 --> 02:34:50.047
INTO? IT'S IT WOULD BE LOVELY

02:34:50.114 --> 02:34:51.281
IF THERE WAS ONE GENERAL ONE,

02:34:51.348 --> 02:34:53.150
BUT I THINK THAT'S WE'RE NOT

02:34:53.217 --> 02:34:54.118
GOING TO GET THERE. FACULTY

02:34:54.184 --> 02:34:56.120
HAVE THE RIGHT TO. YEAH

02:34:56.186 --> 02:34:57.621
DETERMINE THEIR OWN GRADING

02:34:57.688 --> 02:34:58.222
ENVIRONMENT AND STANDARDS AND

02:34:58.288 --> 02:34:59.089
EXPECTATIONS. AND WE WOULD WANT

02:34:59.156 --> 02:35:01.091
THEM TO HAVE THAT AUTONOMY. BUT

02:35:01.158 --> 02:35:03.093
HAVING SOME KIND OF EXPECTATION

02:35:03.160 --> 02:35:05.062
SEEMS LIKE A A FAIR ASK. I

02:35:05.129 --> 02:35:08.632
THINK SO TOO. I THINK

02:35:08.699 --> 02:35:11.235
FUNDAMENTALLY MANY OF US IN

02:35:11.301 --> 02:35:13.003
EDUCATION, I THINK EDUCATION IN

02:35:13.070 --> 02:35:14.571
GENERAL NEEDS TO MOVE AWAY FROM

02:35:14.638 --> 02:35:18.409
A PUNITIVE MODEL OF TEACHING

02:35:18.475 --> 02:35:20.144
STUDENTS. LIKE I'VE BEEN

02:35:20.210 --> 02:35:21.311
TEACHING FOR ALMOST 20 YEARS.

02:35:21.378 --> 02:35:22.146
I'M STILL HERE TO LEARN. I'M

02:35:22.212 --> 02:35:25.516
LEARNING A LOT RIGHT NOW. SO

02:35:25.582 --> 02:35:27.151
AND AND THIS IS WHERE ACADEMIC

02:35:27.217 --> 02:35:29.820
FREEDOM COMES IN. YOU KNOW YOUR

02:35:29.887 --> 02:35:31.088
CLASSROOM BEST THAT YOU KNOW

02:35:31.155 --> 02:35:34.124
YOUR STUDENTS BEST. IT IS YOUR

02:35:34.191 --> 02:35:35.426
IT'S BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR

02:35:35.492 --> 02:35:36.994
STUDENTS. YOU CRAFT THAT

02:35:37.061 --> 02:35:38.896
WORKING RELATIONSHIP. I HAD A

02:35:38.962 --> 02:35:42.866
COLLEAGUE WHO IS IN IN IN

02:35:42.933 --> 02:35:45.169
PHILADELPHIA. SO WHAT HE DID

02:35:45.235 --> 02:35:47.237
WAS THAT HIM AND HIS STUDENTS

02:35:47.304 --> 02:35:48.972
ACTUALLY CAME UP WITH WHAT THE

02:35:49.039 --> 02:35:51.108
POLICY TOGETHER IN THEIR

02:35:51.175 --> 02:35:52.009
CLASSROOM. SO IT'S SOMETHING

02:35:52.076 --> 02:35:54.178
WHERE YOU CAN. YES, GENERALLY,

02:35:54.244 --> 02:35:56.313
HEY, YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING

02:35:56.380 --> 02:35:57.081
WITH YOUR STUDENTS? HERE'S SOME

02:35:57.147 --> 02:35:58.215
GUIDELINES. RIGHT. SO EVERY

02:35:58.282 --> 02:35:59.316
SEMESTER, BECAUSE EVERY

02:35:59.383 --> 02:36:00.784
SEMESTER IS VERY DIFFERENT, I

02:36:00.851 --> 02:36:02.219
HAVE 210 STUDENTS THIS SEMESTER.

02:36:02.286 --> 02:36:04.755
IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT AUDIENCE

02:36:04.822 --> 02:36:07.091
EVERY 16 WEEKS. SO SO IT'S A

02:36:07.157 --> 02:36:10.461
WAY TO TO HAVE COMMUNITY AND

02:36:10.527 --> 02:36:11.962
AGENCY WITHIN THE CLASSROOM.

02:36:12.029 --> 02:36:14.832
YEAH FOR SURE. THANK YOU FOR

02:36:14.898 --> 02:36:18.102
THE QUESTION. SO MUCH. SO ASU

02:36:18.168 --> 02:36:20.938
ACTUALLY RECOMMENDED SYLLABUS

02:36:21.004 --> 02:36:24.942
LANGUAGE FOR THE SYSTEM ON AI.

02:36:25.008 --> 02:36:29.213
AND I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT'S

02:36:29.279 --> 02:36:30.047
TRICKLED INTO EVERYTHING YET.

02:36:30.114 --> 02:36:32.216
BUT IT'S OUT THERE. AND

02:36:32.282 --> 02:36:36.086
CERTAINLY YOU KNOW THERE'S NO

02:36:36.153 --> 02:36:38.922
HARM IN IN RECIRCULATING THAT.

02:36:38.989 --> 02:36:41.024
ALSO FACULTY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED

02:36:41.091 --> 02:36:44.361
AT VARIOUS LEVELS AT THE CAMPUS

02:36:44.428 --> 02:36:46.296
AND SYSTEM LEVEL IN TERMS OF

02:36:46.363 --> 02:36:47.197
SOME OF THE POLICY DEVELOPMENT

02:36:47.264 --> 02:36:49.933
THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, SOME

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.970
OF IT IS HOUSED IN DIGITAL

02:36:53.036 --> 02:36:55.873
LEARNING POLICIES. SO IT'S NOT

02:36:55.939 --> 02:36:58.041
JUST AI, BUT WHOLLY

02:36:58.108 --> 02:36:59.943
ENCOMPASSING OF OF ALL THE

02:37:00.010 --> 02:37:02.012
DIGITAL TOOLS THAT WE USE, AND

02:37:02.079 --> 02:37:03.881
PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT ARE THE

02:37:03.947 --> 02:37:07.484
THE DETECTION TOOLS, WHICH ARE

02:37:07.551 --> 02:37:11.021
ARE VERY MUCH A CONCERN FOR US

02:37:11.088 --> 02:37:15.125
RIGHT NOW. AND LASTLY, I JUST

02:37:15.192 --> 02:37:17.861
WANTED TO TO MENTION THAT SOME

02:37:17.928 --> 02:37:21.098
OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE IS

02:37:21.165 --> 02:37:23.000
THAT WITH THE ADOPTION OF THIS

02:37:23.066 --> 02:37:25.402
TECHNOLOGY AND AS WE MOVE

02:37:25.469 --> 02:37:27.204
FORWARD, THERE'S THERE'S ALWAYS

02:37:27.271 --> 02:37:29.206
DIFFERENT LEVELS OF ACCEPTANCE

02:37:29.273 --> 02:37:32.176
AND USE AS WE GO. BUT I THINK

02:37:32.242 --> 02:37:33.310
ANOTHER SORT OF OVERARCHING

02:37:33.377 --> 02:37:35.579
CONCERN IS THE NUMBER OF

02:37:35.646 --> 02:37:36.947
STUDENTS IN THE CLASSROOM. THE

02:37:37.014 --> 02:37:39.883
CSU PRIDES ITSELF ON ITS

02:37:39.950 --> 02:37:42.119
STUDENT TO FACULTY RATIOS AND

02:37:42.186 --> 02:37:44.087
ITS STUDENT TO FACULTY

02:37:44.154 --> 02:37:46.423
INTERACTIONS. AND WHEN WE LOSE

02:37:46.490 --> 02:37:49.893
THAT ABILITY TO HAVE THAT

02:37:49.960 --> 02:37:51.295
INTERACTION BECAUSE OUR CLASSES

02:37:51.361 --> 02:37:53.897
ARE TOO BIG, THEN WE FALL TO

02:37:53.964 --> 02:37:57.501
THESE OTHER TOOLS THAT ARE THAT

02:37:57.568 --> 02:38:00.671
HAVE PROBLEMS. AND OFTEN IT'S

02:38:00.737 --> 02:38:01.238
THE SAME THING FOR STUDENTS

02:38:01.305 --> 02:38:03.140
WHEN STUDENTS ARE OVERWHELMED,

02:38:03.207 --> 02:38:05.275
WHICH MANY OF OUR STUDENTS ARE

02:38:05.342 --> 02:38:07.010
COMING INTO THE CSU, THEY HAVE

02:38:07.077 --> 02:38:08.278
JOBS, THEY'RE SUPPORTING

02:38:08.345 --> 02:38:10.047
FAMILIES. THEY'RE MAYBE NOT A

02:38:10.113 --> 02:38:11.481
TRADITIONAL STUDENT IN THE

02:38:11.548 --> 02:38:14.518
SENSE OF WE THINK OF THEM. THEY

02:38:14.585 --> 02:38:16.053
NEED RESOURCES, AND IT'S EASY

02:38:16.119 --> 02:38:19.156
TO FALL INTO A QUICK USE OF A

02:38:19.223 --> 02:38:21.024
TOOL RATHER THAN THAN GOING

02:38:21.091 --> 02:38:23.360
THROUGH THAT PROCESS SOMETIMES

02:38:23.427 --> 02:38:25.028
OF OF DEVELOPING THAT. SO I

02:38:25.095 --> 02:38:27.097
THINK THAT WE'RE SEEING SORT OF

02:38:27.164 --> 02:38:29.433
A CULMINATION OF A LOT OF THAT,

02:38:29.499 --> 02:38:31.401
THAT I DON'T I THINK OUR

02:38:31.468 --> 02:38:32.169
POLICIES COULD REALLY HELP US

02:38:32.236 --> 02:38:34.938
WITH IN TERMS OF GUIDANCE. BUT

02:38:35.005 --> 02:38:36.573
THERE'S SOME OTHER GAPS THAT

02:38:36.640 --> 02:38:37.975
I'M NOT SURE THAT CAN BE SOLVED

02:38:38.041 --> 02:38:40.010
IN, IN THOSE WAYS. NOT THAT YOU

02:38:40.077 --> 02:38:41.678
WERE TRYING TO SUGGEST THAT,

02:38:41.745 --> 02:38:42.846
BUT I THINK THEY OVERLAP AND

02:38:42.913 --> 02:38:44.147
INTERSECT. YEAH. AND CERTAINLY

02:38:44.214 --> 02:38:46.250
WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE, TAKING A

02:38:46.316 --> 02:38:47.885
HIGHER LEVEL CALCULUS CLASS, WE

02:38:47.951 --> 02:38:49.353
HAD A RETIRED PROFESSOR COME

02:38:49.419 --> 02:38:50.921
OUT OF RETIREMENT TO TEACH OUR

02:38:50.988 --> 02:38:52.890
CLASS, AND HE SAID, YOU CAN'T

02:38:52.956 --> 02:38:54.558
USE CALCULATORS BECAUSE THE

02:38:54.625 --> 02:38:55.125
HUMAN BRAIN INVENTED

02:38:55.192 --> 02:38:57.160
CALCULATORS, AND YOU HAVE

02:38:57.227 --> 02:38:59.229
TABLES AND CHARTS THAT YOU

02:38:59.296 --> 02:39:00.197
COULD USE TO DO ALL YOUR

02:39:00.264 --> 02:39:01.965
CALCULUS. I DON'T WANT US TO

02:39:02.032 --> 02:39:04.635
HAVE THAT KIND OF MINDSET. AS

02:39:04.701 --> 02:39:06.036
WE LOOK AT AI, WE HAVE THIS

02:39:06.103 --> 02:39:08.005
TOOL IN FRONT OF US. IT IS A

02:39:08.071 --> 02:39:10.340
POWERFUL TOOL, BUT WE SHOULD

02:39:10.407 --> 02:39:12.276
DEFINITELY PRODUCE AND MAINTAIN.

02:39:12.342 --> 02:39:15.812
AND EVEN, YOU KNOW, TWEAK THOSE

02:39:15.879 --> 02:39:18.081
GUARDRAILS AS WE MOVE FORWARD

02:39:18.148 --> 02:39:20.217
WITH HOW WE'RE USING THEM. BUT

02:39:20.284 --> 02:39:20.984
I THINK STUDENT VOICE HAS TO

02:39:21.051 --> 02:39:23.053
KIND OF LEAD THE WAY. YEP,

02:39:23.120 --> 02:39:24.254
ABSOLUTELY. I REALLY BELIEVE

02:39:24.321 --> 02:39:25.856
THAT. I THINK OUR STUDENTS

02:39:25.923 --> 02:39:27.624
REALLY THEY KNOW THE TECHNOLOGY

02:39:27.691 --> 02:39:29.159
THAT THEY'RE INTERACTING WITH.

02:39:29.226 --> 02:39:31.028
THEY THEY ARE PART OF ITS ITS

02:39:31.094 --> 02:39:33.130
DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH. THEY'RE

02:39:33.196 --> 02:39:35.065
THE LARGEST USER OF AI TOOLS.

02:39:35.132 --> 02:39:38.936
AND I THINK WE NEED TO LET THEM

02:39:39.002 --> 02:39:40.737
DIRECT HOW THEY WANT THEIR

02:39:40.804 --> 02:39:42.105
EDUCATION DELIVERED TO THEM. SO

02:39:42.172 --> 02:39:45.375
THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

02:39:45.442 --> 02:39:47.844
CHAIR BAUER KHN. THANK YOU.

02:39:47.911 --> 02:39:49.012
AND I HAVE TO SAY, VICE

02:39:49.079 --> 02:39:51.048
PRESIDENT KARAM, I DON'T KNOW.

02:39:51.114 --> 02:39:52.015
WE'RE DOING GREAT AT CSU'S.

02:39:52.082 --> 02:39:54.985
THIS IS YOUR TESTIMONY WAS SO

02:39:55.052 --> 02:39:56.853
IMPRESSIVE. WE DON'T NEED TO

02:39:56.920 --> 02:39:57.921
CHANGE ANYTHING. AND THAT'S

02:39:57.988 --> 02:39:59.957
WHERE WE BROKE THINGS. BUT I

02:40:00.023 --> 02:40:01.892
THINK I REALLY APPRECIATE THE

02:40:01.959 --> 02:40:02.292
CONVERSATION THAT

02:40:02.359 --> 02:40:04.094
ASSEMBLYMEMBER PATEL LED AROUND

02:40:04.161 --> 02:40:05.696
POLICIES. I WAS ALARMED,

02:40:05.762 --> 02:40:07.097
FRANKLY, THAT THERE WASN'T MUCH

02:40:07.164 --> 02:40:08.031
DIRECTION COMING DOWN,

02:40:08.098 --> 02:40:09.232
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE WAY THE

02:40:09.299 --> 02:40:10.367
ROLLOUT HAPPENED WHERE THEY

02:40:10.434 --> 02:40:12.402
WERE HANDING THIS TO YOU. AND

02:40:12.469 --> 02:40:13.203
THEN IT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE

02:40:13.270 --> 02:40:15.005
HANDING YOU A LOT OF HELPFUL

02:40:15.072 --> 02:40:17.040
GUIDANCE, IF YOU WILL. AND I

02:40:17.107 --> 02:40:18.408
THINK I WOULD SAY, I APPRECIATE

02:40:18.475 --> 02:40:19.176
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT

02:40:19.242 --> 02:40:20.310
ACADEMIC FREEDOM AND POLICIES

02:40:20.377 --> 02:40:22.379
BEING SET AT THE CLASSROOM

02:40:22.446 --> 02:40:22.913
LEVEL. I ALSO THINK MODEL

02:40:22.980 --> 02:40:24.214
POLICIES LIKE YOU'RE MENTIONING

02:40:24.281 --> 02:40:26.450
IN THE SYLLABUS COULD BE SUPER

02:40:26.516 --> 02:40:27.284
HELPFUL. THIS IS COMPLEX STUFF.

02:40:27.351 --> 02:40:29.086
I THINK. I IMAGINE A WORLD

02:40:29.152 --> 02:40:30.520
WHERE THEY'RE RIGHT. IT WOULD

02:40:30.587 --> 02:40:31.288
APPLY DIFFERENTLY IN A ENGLISH

02:40:31.355 --> 02:40:32.990
CLASS THAN A MATH CLASS, BUT

02:40:33.056 --> 02:40:34.157
YOU COULD HAVE MATH FACULTY

02:40:34.224 --> 02:40:35.258
COMING TOGETHER ACROSS THE

02:40:35.325 --> 02:40:36.927
SYSTEM TO COME UP WITH A MODEL

02:40:36.994 --> 02:40:38.061
POLICY THAT, AGAIN, CAN BE

02:40:38.128 --> 02:40:39.329
TWEAKED AT THE CLASSROOM LEVEL,

02:40:39.396 --> 02:40:40.497
BUT PROVIDES SOME STARTING

02:40:40.564 --> 02:40:42.165
POINT, BECAUSE I DON'T THINK

02:40:42.232 --> 02:40:43.467
EVERY FACULTY MEMBER ACROSS THE

02:40:43.533 --> 02:40:45.335
SYSTEM IS PREPARED TO DO THAT.

02:40:45.402 --> 02:40:47.070
AND THAT'S ALSO OKAY. SO, YOU

02:40:47.137 --> 02:40:49.272
KNOW, I MEAN, I THINK PEOPLE

02:40:49.339 --> 02:40:50.574
HAVE DIFFERENT LITERACY LEVELS

02:40:50.640 --> 02:40:51.908
AT THIS POINT AND WE SHOULD BE

02:40:51.975 --> 02:40:53.677
SUPPORTING THEM IN THIS

02:40:53.744 --> 02:40:54.211
ADOPTION. BUT AGAIN, ALSO

02:40:54.277 --> 02:40:57.047
BALANCING WITH FREEDOM. I ALSO

02:40:57.114 --> 02:40:58.815
WAS ALARMED, AS YOU PROBABLY

02:40:58.882 --> 02:41:01.418
COULD TELL, BY WHAT SEEMED TO

02:41:01.485 --> 02:41:03.053
BE INCONSISTENCY IN THE

02:41:03.120 --> 02:41:05.055
TRAINING. I THINK, YOU KNOW,

02:41:05.122 --> 02:41:07.224
AND I HEARD YOU SAY THIS, I

02:41:07.290 --> 02:41:08.859
THINK BOTH OF YOU SAY THIS,

02:41:08.925 --> 02:41:10.093
THAT YOU COULD SIGN UP AND

02:41:10.160 --> 02:41:12.529
THERE WAS NO OBLIGATION TO

02:41:12.596 --> 02:41:13.430
ACTUALLY TAKE THE TRAINING,

02:41:13.497 --> 02:41:15.165
WHICH WAS WILD TO ME. I'LL BE

02:41:15.232 --> 02:41:16.933
FRANK. I THINK THAT IF WE'RE

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:18.468
HANDING YOU THIS TOOL, THERE

02:41:18.535 --> 02:41:19.369
SHOULD BE SOME EXPECTATION THAT

02:41:19.436 --> 02:41:21.304
GOES ALONG WITH IT. I ALSO WILL

02:41:21.371 --> 02:41:24.274
SAY, I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO

02:41:24.341 --> 02:41:27.411
SEE THE SYSTEM SAY THERE HAS TO

02:41:27.477 --> 02:41:29.112
BE A POLICY, WHICH I THINK IS

02:41:29.179 --> 02:41:30.280
WHAT IS SAYING WHAT YOU KNOW,

02:41:30.347 --> 02:41:31.114
AGAIN, THERE SHOULD BE MODEL

02:41:31.181 --> 02:41:32.983
POLICIES. I THINK THE FACULTY

02:41:33.050 --> 02:41:34.918
SHOULD BE ABLE TO TWEAK THEM.

02:41:34.985 --> 02:41:35.952
BUT I THINK THAT IF A STUDENT

02:41:36.019 --> 02:41:37.154
IS BEING REPORTED, AS YOU

02:41:37.220 --> 02:41:38.321
MENTIONED, THERE SHOULD BE NO

02:41:38.388 --> 02:41:39.956
DISCIPLINE UNLESS IT WAS CLEAR

02:41:40.023 --> 02:41:41.691
TO THE STUDENT WHAT THE

02:41:41.758 --> 02:41:42.259
EXPECTATIONS WERE. AND THAT

02:41:42.325 --> 02:41:44.327
PERIOD, LIKE, I DON'T KNOW HOW

02:41:44.394 --> 02:41:45.295
WE CAN DISCIPLINE STUDENTS WHEN

02:41:45.362 --> 02:41:47.030
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

02:41:47.097 --> 02:41:48.031
EXPECTATION IS. AND IT IS

02:41:48.098 --> 02:41:48.799
DIFFERENT CLASSROOM TO

02:41:48.865 --> 02:41:50.000
CLASSROOM, AND IT CAN BE

02:41:50.067 --> 02:41:51.401
DIFFERENT CLASSROOM CLASSROOM.

02:41:51.468 --> 02:41:52.369
IF THEY WALK IN AND THEY ARE

02:41:52.436 --> 02:41:53.503
TOLD CLEARLY WHAT THOSE

02:41:53.570 --> 02:41:55.372
EXPECTATIONS ARE, OUR STUDENTS

02:41:55.439 --> 02:41:56.139
ARE SMART. THEY CAN MAKE

02:41:56.206 --> 02:41:57.274
DIFFERENT EXPECTATIONS IN

02:41:57.340 --> 02:41:57.908
DIFFERENT CLASSROOMS IF THEY'RE

02:41:57.974 --> 02:41:59.509
LAID OUT. AND THEN I THINK THE

02:41:59.576 --> 02:42:00.277
DISCIPLINE SHOULD ONLY BE

02:42:00.343 --> 02:42:01.812
DEPENDENT ON WHAT THEY WERE

02:42:01.878 --> 02:42:03.113
TOLD. I THAT I JUST WANTED TO

02:42:03.180 --> 02:42:05.449
SAY, BECAUSE I WAS UPSET TO

02:42:05.515 --> 02:42:06.083
HEAR THAT I THINK THAT STUDENTS

02:42:06.149 --> 02:42:09.119
SHOULD. AND I WILL SAY THAT

02:42:09.186 --> 02:42:10.854
WHEN MY SON WAS FLAGGED BY ONE

02:42:10.921 --> 02:42:12.089
OF THESE AI DETECTION TOOLS, I

02:42:12.155 --> 02:42:13.256
SAID, THAT'S AWESOME. IT MEANS

02:42:13.323 --> 02:42:15.158
YOUR GRANDMA IS REALLY GOOD

02:42:15.225 --> 02:42:15.992
BECAUSE I HAD WATCHED HIM WRITE

02:42:16.059 --> 02:42:18.161
THE PAPER, SO I KNEW HE DIDN'T

02:42:18.228 --> 02:42:19.362
USE AI. BUT THAT'S I MEAN,

02:42:19.429 --> 02:42:21.131
THESE TOOLS, THAT'S EXACTLY

02:42:21.198 --> 02:42:22.065
WHAT THEY'RE DOING. I WAS LIKE,

02:42:22.132 --> 02:42:23.300
WOW, YOU MUST HAVE INCREDIBLE

02:42:23.366 --> 02:42:24.835
GRAMMAR. SO, YOU KNOW, IT ISN'T

02:42:24.901 --> 02:42:26.503
FAIR. AND WE ONE OF THE THINGS

02:42:26.570 --> 02:42:27.437
THIS LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN

02:42:27.504 --> 02:42:28.505
PUSHING THROUGH BUDGET ACTIONS

02:42:28.572 --> 02:42:30.107
IN MY SIX YEARS HERE IS MOVING

02:42:30.173 --> 02:42:32.175
TO 100% OF OUR CSU STUDENTS

02:42:32.242 --> 02:42:33.443
GRADUATING IN FOUR YEARS. THOSE

02:42:33.510 --> 02:42:34.978
NUMBERS NEED TO CHANGE. IT IS

02:42:35.045 --> 02:42:37.114
COSTING OUR STUDENTS TOO MUCH

02:42:37.180 --> 02:42:38.348
IN TIME AND MONEY TO NOT BE

02:42:38.415 --> 02:42:40.117
ABLE TO GET THROUGH CSU SYSTEM

02:42:40.183 --> 02:42:42.152
AS QUICKLY AS THEY WOULD LIKE,

02:42:42.219 --> 02:42:44.421
AND SO IF THIS IS AN ADDED

02:42:44.488 --> 02:42:45.622
PROBLEM TO GETTING CSU STUDENTS

02:42:45.689 --> 02:42:47.157
TO GRADUATION AND ON TO THE

02:42:47.224 --> 02:42:50.660
LIVES THEY DESERVE TO LEAD POST.

02:42:50.727 --> 02:42:52.996
DEGREE, THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE,

02:42:53.063 --> 02:42:54.998
PERIOD. BECAUSE I KNOW THAT IS

02:42:55.065 --> 02:42:56.032
A PRIORITY OF THIS LEGISLATURE.

02:42:56.099 --> 02:42:58.068
SO I WANTED TO ADD THOSE

02:42:58.135 --> 02:43:02.973
COMMENTS ON. I AM GOING TO ASK

02:43:03.039 --> 02:43:05.275
ONE OF, AND I DON'T KNOW IF

02:43:05.342 --> 02:43:07.077
THIS IS THE TIME TO DO THAT. I

02:43:07.144 --> 02:43:09.212
WAS GOING TO ASK MR. CLARK TO

02:43:09.279 --> 02:43:11.047
ANSWER ONE OF VICE PRESIDENT

02:43:11.114 --> 02:43:12.182
GRAHAM'S QUESTION. I DON'T KNOW

02:43:12.249 --> 02:43:13.917
IF YOU'LL COME UP, MR. CLARK. I

02:43:13.984 --> 02:43:15.952
THOUGHT IT WAS A REALLY GOOD

02:43:16.019 --> 02:43:17.154
QUESTION THAT WAS POSED. YOU

02:43:17.220 --> 02:43:18.054
WERE VERY CLEAR IN THE FIRST

02:43:18.121 --> 02:43:19.923
PANEL THAT DURING THE COURSE OF

02:43:19.990 --> 02:43:21.658
THE CONTRACT, THE INFORMATION

02:43:21.725 --> 02:43:24.895
IS PRIVATE. THE QUESTION WAS

02:43:24.961 --> 02:43:26.129
POSED BY THE STUDENT

02:43:26.196 --> 02:43:27.964
ASSOCIATION. WHAT HAPPENS AFTER

02:43:28.031 --> 02:43:29.266
THE END OF THE CONTRACT? CAN

02:43:29.332 --> 02:43:31.201
YOU ANSWER THAT FOR US? YEAH, I

02:43:31.268 --> 02:43:32.903
THOUGHT IT WAS A GREAT QUESTION.

02:43:32.969 --> 02:43:34.671
YES, IT IS A GREAT QUESTION. I

02:43:34.738 --> 02:43:36.139
DON'T KNOW IF IT'S EXPLICITLY

02:43:36.206 --> 02:43:37.440
CALLED OUT IN OUR CONTRACT, BUT

02:43:37.507 --> 02:43:38.942
OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT DATA

02:43:39.009 --> 02:43:40.177
WOULD JUST EXPIRE IF THE

02:43:40.243 --> 02:43:41.044
CONTRACT EXPIRES, IT'S JUST

02:43:41.111 --> 02:43:43.213
GOING TO GO AWAY. THERE'S NO

02:43:43.280 --> 02:43:45.248
WAY TO TAKE THE DATA WITH YOU

02:43:45.315 --> 02:43:47.250
WHEN YOU GO. WHEN YOU LEAVE.

02:43:47.317 --> 02:43:48.084
YEAH. IT DOESN'T. YEAH. YEAH.

02:43:48.151 --> 02:43:51.388
SO I WOULD ASK YOU TO FOLLOW UP

02:43:51.454 --> 02:43:52.322
WITH BOTH OF OUR COMMITTEES ON

02:43:52.389 --> 02:43:54.291
WHETHER THAT IS EXPLICIT IN THE

02:43:54.357 --> 02:43:55.125
CONTRACT, BECAUSE IT SHOULD BE,

02:43:55.192 --> 02:43:57.093
AND IF NOT, I WOULD ASK THAT

02:43:57.160 --> 02:43:58.361
YOU CHANGE THAT. I DON'T KNOW

02:43:58.428 --> 02:43:59.996
IF YOU WANT TO. YEAH. PLEASE.

02:44:00.063 --> 02:44:01.064
DEFINITELY. WE WOULD LOVE TO

02:44:01.131 --> 02:44:03.200
SEE SOME FOLLOW UP ON THAT

02:44:03.266 --> 02:44:04.000
PLEASE. OKAY. THANK YOU. THAT

02:44:04.067 --> 02:44:05.902
WAS MY QUESTION. YEAH. AND THEN

02:44:05.969 --> 02:44:08.872
I, I REALLY APPRECIATED, YOU

02:44:08.939 --> 02:44:11.575
KNOW, CHAIR FONG RAISED THE

02:44:11.641 --> 02:44:13.310
QUESTION OF BIAS IN THE FIRST

02:44:13.376 --> 02:44:15.212
PANEL. I THINK IT'S A REALLY

02:44:15.278 --> 02:44:17.414
IMPORTANT ONE, AS THEY SAY, AS

02:44:17.480 --> 02:44:19.616
IT RELATES TO AI. GARBAGE IN,

02:44:19.683 --> 02:44:22.252
GARBAGE OUT. AND SO THESE TOOLS,

02:44:22.319 --> 02:44:24.020
ALTHOUGH POWERFUL AND

02:44:24.087 --> 02:44:25.555
IMPRESSIVE AND WONDERFUL, CAN

02:44:25.622 --> 02:44:27.123
ALSO OUTPUT A LOT OF GARBAGE,

02:44:27.190 --> 02:44:29.326
WHICH I THINK YOU, PROFESSOR

02:44:29.392 --> 02:44:30.994
BERNAL, WERE ALLUDING TO IN

02:44:31.061 --> 02:44:33.196
YOUR COMMENTS AROUND PROTECTING

02:44:33.263 --> 02:44:36.299
OUR STUDENTS AND ESPECIALLY OUR

02:44:36.366 --> 02:44:38.268
STUDENTS OF COLOR AND DISABLED

02:44:38.335 --> 02:44:39.436
STUDENTS AND OUR STUDENTS WHO

02:44:39.502 --> 02:44:40.904
ARE FROM PROTECTED CLASSES. AND

02:44:40.971 --> 02:44:43.807
I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. YOU

02:44:43.873 --> 02:44:45.942
KNOW, I, I WATCH MY KIDS USAGE

02:44:46.009 --> 02:44:48.645
OF THESE TOOLS. AND LIKE MANY

02:44:48.712 --> 02:44:50.180
YOUNG PEOPLE, HE'S NAVIGATING

02:44:50.247 --> 02:44:51.314
DIFFERENT TOOLS, TRYING. THAT'S

02:44:51.381 --> 02:44:52.983
WHAT YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT

02:44:53.049 --> 02:44:54.184
THEY'RE DOING. AND IT'S GREAT

02:44:54.251 --> 02:44:56.419
AND THEY'RE LEARNING FROM IT.

02:44:56.486 --> 02:44:57.354
AND AND HE HAS QUICKLY LEARNED

02:44:57.420 --> 02:44:58.888
WHICH TOOLS ARE SAFE SPACES FOR

02:44:58.955 --> 02:45:00.257
HIM AND WHICH ARE NOT. AND I

02:45:00.323 --> 02:45:01.958
WILL SAY THAT, YOU KNOW, IT IS

02:45:02.025 --> 02:45:03.927
NOT A SECRET. IT WAS VERY

02:45:03.994 --> 02:45:05.862
PUBLIC THAT GROK WAS OUTPUTTING

02:45:05.929 --> 02:45:06.663
SIGNIFICANT ANTI-SEMITIC

02:45:06.730 --> 02:45:08.198
CONTENT THAT WAS SUPER HARMFUL

02:45:08.265 --> 02:45:12.569
TO MY JEWISH SON, AND PUTTING

02:45:12.636 --> 02:45:13.169
OUR STUDENTS IN ENVIRONMENTS,

02:45:13.236 --> 02:45:15.438
WHETHER IT BE JEWISH STUDENTS

02:45:15.505 --> 02:45:16.373
OR STUDENTS OF COLOR, WHERE

02:45:16.439 --> 02:45:19.209
THEY ARE BEING FED, BIASED AND

02:45:19.276 --> 02:45:21.111
HATEFUL CONTENT IS NOT

02:45:21.177 --> 02:45:22.145
SOMETHING WE WANT IN OUR

02:45:22.212 --> 02:45:24.214
SYSTEMS. AND SO I WANTED TO ASK,

02:45:24.281 --> 02:45:26.016
WE HEARD A LITTLE BIT EARLIER

02:45:26.082 --> 02:45:27.150
ABOUT THE ABILITY TO REPORT

02:45:27.217 --> 02:45:29.052
THAT I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY

02:45:29.119 --> 02:45:30.920
HERE HAS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:45:30.987 --> 02:45:32.222
DO SO, AND WHETHER THERE HAS

02:45:32.289 --> 02:45:34.057
BEEN FOLLOW UP OR WHAT YOUR

02:45:34.124 --> 02:45:36.259
EXPERIENCE WITH THAT REPORTING

02:45:36.326 --> 02:45:40.263
MECHANISM HAS BEEN. YEAH. YEAH,

02:45:40.330 --> 02:45:43.967
PLEASE. SO I TRIED TO CREATE AN

02:45:44.034 --> 02:45:45.802
IMAGE THROUGH THIS IS MICROSOFT

02:45:45.869 --> 02:45:49.539
PILOT NØ. YEAH, THIS IS

02:45:49.606 --> 02:45:52.208
MICROSOFT PILOT. SO I TRIED TO

02:45:52.275 --> 02:45:54.144
SO I PROMPTED IT TO CREATE AN

02:45:54.210 --> 02:45:56.146
IMAGE OF A NATIVE AMERICAN

02:45:56.212 --> 02:45:59.049
PERSON IN THE SCIENCES. OKAY.

02:45:59.115 --> 02:46:00.383
SCIENTISTS. RIGHT. SO WHAT IT

02:46:00.450 --> 02:46:04.354
CAME UP WITH WAS A PERSON IN A

02:46:04.421 --> 02:46:06.456
HEADDRESS WITH A WHITE LAB COAT.

02:46:06.523 --> 02:46:08.191
AND I'M LIKE, THIS IS NOT WHAT

02:46:08.258 --> 02:46:11.995
I WANT. SO, I MEAN, I WAS

02:46:12.062 --> 02:46:13.963
CURIOUS. I WANTED TO SEE WHAT

02:46:14.030 --> 02:46:15.899
KIND OF IMAGES THAT CAME UP,

02:46:15.965 --> 02:46:17.634
AND THAT'S WHAT I GOT. AND I

02:46:17.701 --> 02:46:18.368
WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED,

02:46:18.435 --> 02:46:21.338
ESPECIALLY AS A PARENT OF

02:46:21.404 --> 02:46:23.173
FILIPINO, AFRICAN AMERICAN,

02:46:23.239 --> 02:46:26.042
NATIVE AMERICAN CHILDREN WHO

02:46:26.109 --> 02:46:28.144
ARE IN THE SCIENCES, ONE IN

02:46:28.211 --> 02:46:30.046
HIGH SCHOOL, ONE WHO IS WHO

02:46:30.113 --> 02:46:31.181
JUST STARTED HIS THIRD YEAR AS

02:46:31.247 --> 02:46:34.050
A MATH MAJOR. SO SO THERE ARE

02:46:34.117 --> 02:46:35.218
THINGS LIKE THAT. I'M LIKE,

02:46:35.285 --> 02:46:37.187
OKAY, WELL, REPORT IT, BUT YOU

02:46:37.253 --> 02:46:38.121
GET AN AUTOMATED EMAIL, THAT'S

02:46:38.188 --> 02:46:42.926
IT. SO, YOU KNOW, I MEAN, AGAIN,

02:46:42.992 --> 02:46:44.728
HUMAN YOU GOT TO KEEP HUMANS IN

02:46:44.794 --> 02:46:46.963
THE CENTER. RIGHT? SO AS MUCH

02:46:47.030 --> 02:46:49.165
AS CONCERNS AS WE RAISE, TO

02:46:49.232 --> 02:46:49.999
WHAT EXTENT WILL THEY BE

02:46:50.066 --> 02:46:52.435
ADDRESSED. RIGHT. SO THANK YOU

02:46:52.502 --> 02:46:53.837
FOR ASKING THAT. YEAH. SO I

02:46:53.903 --> 02:46:56.039
THINK THANK YOU FOR THAT. SADLY

02:46:56.106 --> 02:46:58.675
I THINK WE COULD HAVE EXAMPLE

02:46:58.742 --> 02:46:59.876
AFTER EXAMPLE OF OFFENSIVE

02:46:59.943 --> 02:47:01.077
THINGS THAT COME OUT OF THESE

02:47:01.144 --> 02:47:03.313
TOOLS TO YOUR POINT. AND SO I

02:47:03.380 --> 02:47:05.081
GUESS, YOU KNOW, IT SOUNDED

02:47:05.148 --> 02:47:07.650
LIKE THE CSU SYSTEM IS RELYING

02:47:07.717 --> 02:47:09.252
ON THE CHATGPT EMBEDDED

02:47:09.319 --> 02:47:11.287
REPORTING TOOL. IT WASN'T CLEAR

02:47:11.354 --> 02:47:14.457
TO ME WHAT HAPPENS NEXT, WHICH

02:47:14.524 --> 02:47:16.126
IS KIND OF WHY I ASKED IF

02:47:16.192 --> 02:47:16.893
ANYBODY ON THIS PANEL HAD

02:47:16.960 --> 02:47:18.161
EXPERIENCED IT. I DON'T KNOW IF

02:47:18.228 --> 02:47:20.196
SOMEONE FROM THE CSU KNOWS THE

02:47:20.263 --> 02:47:21.097
ANSWER. IT DIDN'T SEEM THEY DID.

02:47:21.164 --> 02:47:23.566
IT SEEMED LIKE THEY WERE

02:47:23.633 --> 02:47:24.167
RELYING ON CHATGPT TO ADDRESS

02:47:24.234 --> 02:47:25.602
IT DIRECTLY. IS THAT RIGHT? I'M

02:47:25.668 --> 02:47:26.970
LOOKING AT THEM, BUT I DON'T

02:47:27.036 --> 02:47:29.072
KNOW IF YOU WANT TO COME BACK,

02:47:29.139 --> 02:47:30.240
MR. CLARK, BUT WORTH FOLLOWING

02:47:30.306 --> 02:47:31.875
UP, BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT AT

02:47:31.941 --> 02:47:33.243
LEAST IN THE EDU SYSTEM WE ARE

02:47:33.309 --> 02:47:35.211
PUTTING OUT AS CALIFORNIA AND

02:47:35.278 --> 02:47:36.079
THE CSU, I WOULD WANT TO KNOW

02:47:36.146 --> 02:47:38.148
THAT THAT WAS BEING ADDRESSED,

02:47:38.214 --> 02:47:39.249
THAT IF SOMETHING LIKE THIS

02:47:39.315 --> 02:47:40.383
HAPPENED AND A STUDENT WAS

02:47:40.450 --> 02:47:41.384
PROACTIVE ENOUGH OR FACULTY,

02:47:41.451 --> 02:47:43.920
FRANKLY, TO TO REPORT IT, AS IT

02:47:43.987 --> 02:47:46.122
SAYS, THERE IS A MECHANISM THAT

02:47:46.189 --> 02:47:48.057
THERE'S A CHANGE THAT THAT IS

02:47:48.124 --> 02:47:49.225
CORRECTED GOING FORWARD. YEAH.

02:47:49.292 --> 02:47:50.160
DID YOU WANT TO ADD SOMETHING?

02:47:50.226 --> 02:47:52.562
YEAH. I PERSONALLY DON'T HAVE

02:47:52.629 --> 02:47:53.329
EXPERIENCE WITH I DIDN'T KNOW

02:47:53.396 --> 02:47:55.031
THAT YOU HAD THE ABILITY TO

02:47:55.098 --> 02:47:59.402
REPORT IF CHATGPT WAS PRODUCING

02:47:59.469 --> 02:48:00.036
CONTENT THAT WAS INAPPROPRIATE.

02:48:00.103 --> 02:48:02.939
BUT I WILL SAY LIKE IN THE ONE

02:48:03.006 --> 02:48:04.307
SYSTEM WIDE MESSAGE THAT WAS

02:48:04.374 --> 02:48:05.875
SENT OUT TO STUDENTS BECAUSE I

02:48:05.942 --> 02:48:08.378
RECEIVED IT AS WELL, THERE

02:48:08.445 --> 02:48:09.112
WASN'T ANY REFERENCING OF THAT.

02:48:09.179 --> 02:48:10.880
AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING

02:48:10.947 --> 02:48:12.482
IMPORTANT THAT THE SYSTEM NEEDS

02:48:12.549 --> 02:48:14.217
TO SHARE IS IF THERE ARE

02:48:14.284 --> 02:48:15.852
INAPPROPRIATE THINGS LIKE, I

02:48:15.919 --> 02:48:16.920
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S

02:48:16.986 --> 02:48:18.021
PROBABLY SIX DIFFERENT WEBSITES

02:48:18.087 --> 02:48:19.689
THAT WILL LEAD YOU TO A MESSAGE

02:48:19.756 --> 02:48:21.024
THAT SAYS, HEY, IF THERE'S

02:48:21.090 --> 02:48:22.258
SOMETHING WRONG, YOU SHOULD

02:48:22.325 --> 02:48:24.561
REPORT IT AND LET US KNOW. BUT

02:48:24.627 --> 02:48:25.929
I THINK THAT SHOULD BE KIND OF

02:48:25.995 --> 02:48:27.497
HEADLINED IS, YOU KNOW, HERE'S

02:48:27.564 --> 02:48:28.832
CHATGPT EDU, HERE'S THE

02:48:28.898 --> 02:48:31.034
TRAINING LINK, AND HERE'S A

02:48:31.100 --> 02:48:33.102
LINK TO LET US KNOW IF THINGS

02:48:33.169 --> 02:48:34.971
AREN'T LOOKING RIGHT, YOU KNOW,

02:48:35.038 --> 02:48:36.606
AND IT'S NOT REALLY SHARED IN

02:48:36.673 --> 02:48:38.208
THAT HOLE BASED OFF OF MY

02:48:38.274 --> 02:48:39.108
EXPERIENCE. YEAH. AND I WOULD

02:48:39.175 --> 02:48:41.077
WANT THAT IN THE TRAINING TOO.

02:48:41.144 --> 02:48:42.145
ABSOLUTELY. PEOPLE SHOULD BE

02:48:42.212 --> 02:48:43.947
MANDATED TO TAKE I WILL ADD FOR

02:48:44.013 --> 02:48:45.181
STAFF IT'S A HUGE CONCERN

02:48:45.248 --> 02:48:46.249
BECAUSE OF DISCIPLINE. THEY'RE

02:48:46.316 --> 02:48:47.984
AFRAID THAT WHAT IF I PUT

02:48:48.051 --> 02:48:49.519
SOMETHING IN AND CHAT DID

02:48:49.586 --> 02:48:51.321
SOMETHING? AM I GOING TO GET IN

02:48:51.387 --> 02:48:53.122
TROUBLE NOW BECAUSE IT FLAGGED

02:48:53.189 --> 02:48:54.424
THIS AS INAPPROPRIATE? AND THEN

02:48:54.491 --> 02:48:56.059
I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT FLAGGED

02:48:56.125 --> 02:48:57.994
AND WHO IT WENT TO. DID IT GO

02:48:58.061 --> 02:49:00.129
TO MY MANAGER OR DID IT GO TO

02:49:00.196 --> 02:49:01.865
HR? DID IT GO? SO THAT'S OUR

02:49:01.931 --> 02:49:03.066
CONCERN TOO IS WE DON'T KNOW

02:49:03.132 --> 02:49:04.300
WHERE THIS DATA IS GOING

02:49:04.367 --> 02:49:05.969
BECAUSE STAFF IS BEEN ROLLED

02:49:06.035 --> 02:49:07.570
OUT AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY

02:49:07.637 --> 02:49:08.238
TRAINING. IT'S NOT REQUIRED.

02:49:08.304 --> 02:49:10.306
RIGHT? NO. AND THAT IS I THINK

02:49:10.373 --> 02:49:12.275
IT SHOULD ALSO BE CLEAR THAT TO

02:49:12.342 --> 02:49:13.309
THE EXTENT THAT YOU'RE

02:49:13.376 --> 02:49:14.878
REPORTING BIAS, PROBLEMATIC

02:49:14.944 --> 02:49:17.113
OUTPUTS, THAT THAT IS NOT A

02:49:17.180 --> 02:49:18.214
CAUSE FOR DISCIPLINE FOR

02:49:18.281 --> 02:49:19.916
ANYBODY. STUDENTS, STAFF,

02:49:19.983 --> 02:49:22.118
FACULTY, PERIOD. BECAUSE THAT'S

02:49:22.185 --> 02:49:23.920
IMPORTANT TO HAPPEN. AND IT

02:49:23.987 --> 02:49:24.954
SHOULDN'T BE SOMETHING THAT

02:49:25.021 --> 02:49:26.756
RESULTS IN DISCIPLINE BY ANY

02:49:26.823 --> 02:49:27.357
MEANS. THANK YOU FOR THAT. SO

02:49:27.423 --> 02:49:29.726
WE CAN GET FOLLOW UP ON THAT

02:49:29.792 --> 02:49:31.094
TOO. THERE'S LOTS OF FOLLOW UP

02:49:31.160 --> 02:49:32.262
COMING OUT OF THIS HEARING,

02:49:32.328 --> 02:49:34.097
WHICH IS GOOD NEWS. AND THEN,

02:49:34.163 --> 02:49:36.699
YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A COMMENT

02:49:36.766 --> 02:49:39.802
MADE THAT IT WAS ROLLED OUT

02:49:39.869 --> 02:49:41.170
WITHOUT CONSULTATION. SO MY

02:49:41.237 --> 02:49:43.072
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT WAS

02:49:43.139 --> 02:49:44.941
ROLLED OUT. STUDENTS, FACULTY

02:49:45.008 --> 02:49:46.910
HAD ACCESS TO THIS. AND THEN

02:49:46.976 --> 02:49:50.213
THESE WORK GROUPS THAT SOME OF

02:49:50.280 --> 02:49:53.149
YOU ARE ON WERE CONVENED THAT

02:49:53.216 --> 02:49:54.083
ALLOWED FOR INPUT AFTER THE

02:49:54.150 --> 02:49:56.019
FACT. IS THAT CORRECT? AM I

02:49:56.085 --> 02:49:57.220
UNDERSTANDING THAT? YEAH, I

02:49:57.287 --> 02:49:59.355
THINK IT SPEAKS TO WHAT I SAID.

02:49:59.422 --> 02:50:01.124
OKAY. AS STAFF IN THE SYSTEM,

02:50:01.190 --> 02:50:03.326
WE DON'T FEEL THAT WE WERE

02:50:03.393 --> 02:50:04.961
INCLUDED. THERE MAY HAVE BEEN

02:50:05.028 --> 02:50:06.095
ONE STAFF PERSON MAYBE ON THE

02:50:06.162 --> 02:50:08.197
SYSTEM WIDE, BUT WE DON'T KNOW.

02:50:08.264 --> 02:50:09.465
I CAN'T TELL YOU WHO THAT

02:50:09.532 --> 02:50:11.134
PERSON IS OR WHAT THEIR NAME IS.

02:50:11.200 --> 02:50:12.302
THE INFORMATION IS WE USUALLY

02:50:12.368 --> 02:50:14.003
GET ONE SEAT, AND IT'S VERY

02:50:14.070 --> 02:50:15.171
HARD FOR THAT PERSON TO EVEN

02:50:15.238 --> 02:50:17.540
TRANSLATE OUT TO THE REST OF

02:50:17.607 --> 02:50:18.141
WE'RE, YOU KNOW, 20,000 STAFF.

02:50:18.207 --> 02:50:21.144
YEAH, RIGHT. AND SO FOR US,

02:50:21.210 --> 02:50:22.312
IT'S AN AFTERTHOUGHT. AND THEN

02:50:22.378 --> 02:50:24.581
WE'RE THE ONES WE'RE THE BEHIND

02:50:24.647 --> 02:50:26.416
THE SCENES HELPING. WHEN THE

02:50:26.482 --> 02:50:27.150
QUESTION COMES IN FOR HELP,

02:50:27.216 --> 02:50:29.118
IT'S NOT GOING TO FACULTY, IT'S

02:50:29.185 --> 02:50:30.920
GOING TO STAFF. AND SO WE HAVE

02:50:30.987 --> 02:50:32.121
STAFF WHO ARE NOW CONCERNED

02:50:32.188 --> 02:50:33.423
BECAUSE THEY'RE LIKE, IT'S HERE.

02:50:33.489 --> 02:50:35.592
AND WE ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT

02:50:35.658 --> 02:50:36.092
TO DO WITH IT BECAUSE WE

02:50:36.159 --> 02:50:37.994
WEREN'T ASKED OR INVOLVED OR

02:50:38.061 --> 02:50:39.929
HOW THIS IS GOING TO AFFECT MY

02:50:39.996 --> 02:50:41.030
DAY TO DAY WORK AND LIFE, AND

02:50:41.097 --> 02:50:43.132
HOW DO I ASSIST THE FACULTY AND

02:50:43.199 --> 02:50:44.367
STAFF MEMBER THAT MAKE AND AND

02:50:44.434 --> 02:50:45.935
STUDENT THAT MAY COME TO THE

02:50:46.002 --> 02:50:47.870
ROOM TO ASK ME, WHAT DO I DO?

02:50:47.937 --> 02:50:49.038
AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

02:50:49.105 --> 02:50:50.106
TALKING ABOUT. WE WEREN'T A

02:50:50.173 --> 02:50:52.241
PART OF IT FROM THE BEGINNING.

02:50:52.308 --> 02:50:53.843
WE COULD HAVE HELPED, PROBABLY

02:50:53.910 --> 02:50:55.345
ROLLED THIS OUT TO OUR STAFF IN

02:50:55.411 --> 02:50:56.312
A WAY THAT WOULD MAKE IT

02:50:56.379 --> 02:50:57.814
TRANSPARENT. AND WE'RE HERE TO

02:50:57.880 --> 02:50:59.182
HELP. WE'RE NOT AGAINST IT. OF

02:50:59.248 --> 02:51:00.149
COURSE, WE BELIEVE IN

02:51:00.216 --> 02:51:01.851
TECHNOLOGY AS WELL, BUT ALSO AT

02:51:01.918 --> 02:51:03.486
THE SAME TIME WE WEREN'T AT THE

02:51:03.553 --> 02:51:05.088
TABLE. YEAH, IN A MEANINGFUL

02:51:05.154 --> 02:51:06.389
WAY. YEAH. NO, I APPRECIATE

02:51:06.456 --> 02:51:07.123
THAT. DOES ANYBODY ELSE WANT TO

02:51:07.190 --> 02:51:09.025
CHIME IN FOR ANYTHING BESIDES

02:51:09.092 --> 02:51:10.193
WHAT'S BEEN ADDED? I'M GOOD.

02:51:10.259 --> 02:51:12.528
OKAY. YEAH I CAN I CAN KIND OF

02:51:12.595 --> 02:51:14.163
SPEAK TO THIS. SO SO I ALSO

02:51:14.230 --> 02:51:16.032
SPOKE TO THE I THINK SEVERAL OF

02:51:16.099 --> 02:51:19.836
US DID BRING THIS UP. FACULTY

02:51:19.902 --> 02:51:22.972
WERE INITIATING CONVERSATIONS,

02:51:23.039 --> 02:51:25.141
WAVING FLAGS LIKE, HEY, WE NEED

02:51:25.208 --> 02:51:26.142
TO WE NEED TO CONSIDER WHAT'S

02:51:26.209 --> 02:51:28.111
GOING ON WITH GENERATIVE AI IN

02:51:28.177 --> 02:51:30.580
OUR CLASSROOMS AND HOW IT'S

02:51:30.647 --> 02:51:33.282
BEING UTILIZED. AND SO AND WE

02:51:33.349 --> 02:51:36.386
KIND OF WAVED A FLAG IN 2019.

02:51:36.452 --> 02:51:38.655
WE DIDN'T SEE OVERT INTERACTION

02:51:38.721 --> 02:51:40.590
AT THAT POINT. AND THAT'S WHY

02:51:40.657 --> 02:51:42.158
IT WAS WE DID ANOTHER CALL IN

02:51:42.225 --> 02:51:46.195
2023 WHEN THE ANNOUNCEMENT CAME

02:51:46.262 --> 02:51:48.398
OUT EARLIER THIS YEAR, ALTHOUGH

02:51:48.464 --> 02:51:49.599
WE'D BEEN WORKING THE AI

02:51:49.666 --> 02:51:51.167
COMMONS HAD BEEN UP. THERE'D

02:51:51.234 --> 02:51:53.302
BEEN A REPORT FROM THE DNI

02:51:53.369 --> 02:51:54.404
COMMITTEE THAT INTEGRATION WAS

02:51:54.470 --> 02:51:56.939
GREAT. WHAT WE DIDN'T SEE WAS

02:51:57.006 --> 02:51:59.475
ON THE ROLLOUT WITH THE

02:51:59.542 --> 02:52:01.944
AGREEMENT WITH OPENAI, WE

02:52:02.011 --> 02:52:06.282
DIDN'T SEE. AND AGAIN, TO

02:52:06.349 --> 02:52:08.017
CATHERINE, EXCUSE ME, PRESIDENT

02:52:08.084 --> 02:52:10.887
HERE, THAT'S FINE TO THE POINTS

02:52:10.953 --> 02:52:15.024
MADE. IS THAT THE. THE ROLLOUT?

02:52:15.091 --> 02:52:17.093
I THINK WE COULD HAVE DONE A

02:52:17.160 --> 02:52:20.997
MUCH MORE IN-DEPTH JOB IN THAT

02:52:21.064 --> 02:52:22.832
WAY, AND WE COULD HAVE ISOLATED

02:52:22.899 --> 02:52:25.368
SOME AREAS THAT WE STILL HAD

02:52:25.435 --> 02:52:27.336
GAPS. I DON'T THINK THAT THE

02:52:27.403 --> 02:52:31.040
THE IDEA OF AN AI LITERATE CSU

02:52:31.107 --> 02:52:33.943
AND SOMEONE AND A AND A CSU

02:52:34.010 --> 02:52:35.211
THAT'S LEADING THE NATION IN

02:52:35.278 --> 02:52:38.281
THIS WORK IS A BAD IDEA AT ALL.

02:52:38.347 --> 02:52:39.615
I THINK IT'S EXCELLENT THAT

02:52:39.682 --> 02:52:41.684
WE'RE TRYING. AND I AND I WANT

02:52:41.751 --> 02:52:43.052
TO APPLAUD THAT IN MANY WAYS.

02:52:43.119 --> 02:52:45.221
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THAT

02:52:45.288 --> 02:52:47.690
CONSULTATION PIECE IS SO

02:52:47.757 --> 02:52:49.158
CRITICAL TO WHAT WE STAND FOR

02:52:49.225 --> 02:52:51.761
AS A CSU AND HOW WE MOVE

02:52:51.828 --> 02:52:54.864
FORWARD WITH THINGS ARM IN ARM

02:52:54.931 --> 02:52:57.900
IN THESE ENDEAVORS. IT'S REALLY,

02:52:57.967 --> 02:52:59.268
REALLY CRITICAL. AND SO THERE

02:52:59.335 --> 02:53:02.238
HAS BEEN A LOT OF COLLABORATION

02:53:02.305 --> 02:53:06.075
AS IT'S BEEN ROLLING OUT. BUT

02:53:06.142 --> 02:53:09.278
THEN THERE'S ALSO THIS SORT OF

02:53:09.345 --> 02:53:11.214
NOW WE ALSO HAVE THIS ADDED

02:53:11.280 --> 02:53:13.282
BURDEN OF DEALING WITH WHAT

02:53:13.349 --> 02:53:15.084
DIDN'T GET. YEAH, YOU KNOW,

02:53:15.151 --> 02:53:18.654
TAKEN CARE OF BEFORE IT ROLLED.

02:53:18.721 --> 02:53:20.123
I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT. NO I

02:53:20.189 --> 02:53:22.992
APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK,

02:53:23.059 --> 02:53:25.094
YOU KNOW, I'M A LITTLE BIASED

02:53:25.161 --> 02:53:26.896
HERE BECAUSE I'M A FORMER

02:53:26.963 --> 02:53:29.132
PROFESSOR MYSELF. AND I DO

02:53:29.198 --> 02:53:31.934
THINK THAT THE MAGIC OF THESE

02:53:32.001 --> 02:53:33.236
INSTITUTIONS ARE IS EVERYONE IN

02:53:33.302 --> 02:53:34.737
THE CLASSROOM. THAT'S WHERE THE

02:53:34.804 --> 02:53:36.239
MAGIC HAPPENS, WHERE THE

02:53:36.305 --> 02:53:39.142
STUDENTS GROW AND LEARN AND

02:53:39.208 --> 02:53:40.977
CHANGE, AND THE FACULTY IS

02:53:41.043 --> 02:53:42.078
GROWING AND LEARNING WITH THEM.

02:53:42.145 --> 02:53:43.513
AND NOBODY KNOWS THESE STUDENTS

02:53:43.579 --> 02:53:45.014
BETTER THAN THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:53:45.081 --> 02:53:46.182
IN THE CLASSROOM WITH THEM DAY

02:53:46.249 --> 02:53:48.117
IN AND DAY OUT, SITTING IN

02:53:48.184 --> 02:53:49.152
OFFICE HOURS, ANSWERING THEIR

02:53:49.218 --> 02:53:50.853
QUESTIONS, HEARING THEIR

02:53:50.920 --> 02:53:53.156
DEEPEST FEARS. AND SO I DO

02:53:53.222 --> 02:53:54.157
THINK THAT IT IS CRITICALLY

02:53:54.223 --> 02:53:56.025
IMPORTANT THAT WE PUT THOSE

02:53:56.092 --> 02:53:57.360
CRITICAL PEOPLE AT EVERY TABLE.

02:53:57.426 --> 02:53:58.995
AND I THINK SOME OF THE

02:53:59.061 --> 02:54:00.229
QUESTIONS WE ASKED ABOUT WHAT

02:54:00.296 --> 02:54:01.798
WAS IN THE CONTRACT TODAY THAT

02:54:01.864 --> 02:54:03.633
IT SOUNDS LIKE MAYBE AREN'T IN

02:54:03.699 --> 02:54:05.201
THE CONTRACT WOULD BE HAD THERE

02:54:05.268 --> 02:54:06.969
BEEN MORE PEOPLE AT THAT TABLE.

02:54:07.036 --> 02:54:08.538
AND SO I DO THINK IT'S REALLY

02:54:08.604 --> 02:54:10.106
IMPORTANT I HAD THE PRIVILEGE

02:54:10.173 --> 02:54:11.974
OVER INTERIM TO GO AND HAVE

02:54:12.041 --> 02:54:14.110
CONVERSATIONS WITH SOME OF THE

02:54:14.177 --> 02:54:15.745
LABOR LEADERS IN THE UNITED

02:54:15.812 --> 02:54:18.047
KINGDOM WHO ARE DEALING WITH AI,

02:54:18.114 --> 02:54:19.882
AND IT IS A COUNTRY THAT HAS

02:54:19.949 --> 02:54:21.551
LONG BEEN LABOR LEADING IN THE

02:54:21.617 --> 02:54:23.286
WORLD. AND THEY, I THINK,

02:54:23.352 --> 02:54:24.987
SIMILAR TO TO A LOT OF WHAT

02:54:25.054 --> 02:54:26.055
WE'RE HERE TODAY. THE

02:54:26.122 --> 02:54:27.290
APPLICATION OF AI IS DIFFERENT

02:54:27.356 --> 02:54:29.192
IN EVERY SINGLE CONTEXT, AND

02:54:29.258 --> 02:54:30.359
YOU CANNOT PAINT IT WITH A

02:54:30.426 --> 02:54:32.195
BROAD BRUSH. AND SO IT IS VERY

02:54:32.261 --> 02:54:33.462
COMPLICATED TO CREATE POLICIES

02:54:33.529 --> 02:54:35.364
THAT WILL APPLY IN EVERY

02:54:35.431 --> 02:54:36.098
SETTING. THAT'S JUST THE

02:54:36.165 --> 02:54:37.333
REALITY OF THIS TOOL. AND SO

02:54:37.400 --> 02:54:39.068
THE WAY THEY ARE FACING THIS

02:54:39.135 --> 02:54:41.671
FUTURE IS BY EMPOWERING THE

02:54:41.737 --> 02:54:44.540
WORKERS, BY MAKING THE WORKERS

02:54:44.607 --> 02:54:47.176
SEAT AT THE TABLE AROUND AI

02:54:47.243 --> 02:54:49.045
ALLOWED AND POWERFUL ONE. AND I

02:54:49.111 --> 02:54:51.113
ACTUALLY THINK THAT IT'S AN

02:54:51.180 --> 02:54:52.048
INTERESTING WAY TO GO, BECAUSE

02:54:52.114 --> 02:54:54.016
IT'S NOT SAYING WE'RE GOING TO

02:54:54.083 --> 02:54:56.185
BAN AI IN THIS SETTING OR WE'RE

02:54:56.252 --> 02:54:57.086
GOING TO, YOU KNOW, WHATEVER IT

02:54:57.153 --> 02:55:00.890
IS, BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

02:55:00.957 --> 02:55:02.191
AI HAS PRETTY MUCH GOOD

02:55:02.258 --> 02:55:03.159
APPLICATIONS AND POTENTIALLY

02:55:03.226 --> 02:55:04.327
HARMFUL APPLICATIONS IN EVERY

02:55:04.393 --> 02:55:06.028
SETTING, BUT IT REALLY THESE

02:55:06.095 --> 02:55:07.163
ARE THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW THE

02:55:07.230 --> 02:55:09.232
CONTEXT. AND I THINK IT'S THE

02:55:09.298 --> 02:55:10.199
WAY WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT

02:55:10.266 --> 02:55:11.133
APPROACHING THIS IN THE

02:55:11.200 --> 02:55:13.469
WORKFORCE. AND SOMETHING WAS

02:55:13.536 --> 02:55:15.071
SAID ABOUT REPLACEMENT. I THINK

02:55:15.137 --> 02:55:17.206
IT WAS YOU THAT SAID IT. AND

02:55:17.273 --> 02:55:18.474
THAT WAS AN INTERESTING THING

02:55:18.541 --> 02:55:20.109
TO HEAR, BECAUSE WHAT I READ

02:55:20.176 --> 02:55:21.277
ABOUT THIS ROLLOUT, THAT WAS

02:55:21.344 --> 02:55:22.912
NOT SOMETHING THAT CAME TO MIND

02:55:22.979 --> 02:55:25.014
FOR ME. I DON'T THINK THE WAY

02:55:25.081 --> 02:55:26.249
THAT THIS HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT

02:55:26.315 --> 02:55:27.416
IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD, I

02:55:27.483 --> 02:55:28.985
GUESS, IN MY MIND, EVER REPLACE

02:55:29.051 --> 02:55:30.119
THE FACULTY LIKE THAT'S OR

02:55:30.186 --> 02:55:34.523
STAFF. I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT.

02:55:34.590 --> 02:55:36.158
BUT, YOU KNOW, THAT'S SOMETHING

02:55:36.225 --> 02:55:37.960
THAT WE SHOULD ALWAYS KEEP OUR

02:55:38.027 --> 02:55:39.528
MINDS ON. I THINK AI IS BEST

02:55:39.595 --> 02:55:41.097
USED WHEN IT'S AUGMENTING OUR

02:55:41.163 --> 02:55:41.998
INCREDIBLE POWERS VERSUS

02:55:42.064 --> 02:55:45.167
REPLACING THEM. AND SO I

02:55:45.234 --> 02:55:46.369
APPRECIATED THAT. AND I THINK,

02:55:46.435 --> 02:55:47.970
AGAIN, PUTTING THE PEOPLE AT

02:55:48.037 --> 02:55:49.305
THE TABLE IS HOW YOU ENSURE

02:55:49.372 --> 02:55:50.806
THAT IT IS POWERFUL

02:55:50.873 --> 02:55:51.974
AUGMENTATION INSTEAD OF

02:55:52.041 --> 02:55:54.210
REPLACING PEOPLE. AND A

02:55:54.277 --> 02:55:56.579
UNIVERSITY WOULDN'T BE WHAT IT

02:55:56.646 --> 02:55:57.613
IS WITHOUT THE PEOPLE. SO I

02:55:57.680 --> 02:55:59.649
WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING

02:55:59.715 --> 02:56:02.151
HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH, MADAM

02:56:02.218 --> 02:56:03.352
CHAIR. JUST AMPLIFY THAT. IT'S

02:56:03.419 --> 02:56:04.954
ALL ABOUT THE PEOPLE AT THE

02:56:05.021 --> 02:56:06.155
TABLE. YOU ARE DOING A

02:56:06.222 --> 02:56:07.290
TREMENDOUS WORK EACH AND EVERY

02:56:07.356 --> 02:56:09.492
DAY FOR OUR SYSTEM, FOR OUR

02:56:09.558 --> 02:56:10.092
STUDENTS. REALLY APPRECIATE.

02:56:10.159 --> 02:56:12.228
ALL YOUR LEADERSHIP AND EFFORTS.

02:56:12.295 --> 02:56:13.863
JUST A QUICK COMMENT OR

02:56:13.930 --> 02:56:15.298
QUESTION ON THE REPORTING

02:56:15.364 --> 02:56:17.133
ASPECT. WE KNOW THAT WE'VE

02:56:17.199 --> 02:56:18.968
DIRECTED CSU TO ESTABLISH A

02:56:19.035 --> 02:56:20.937
CIVIL RIGHTS OFFICE. IS THIS A

02:56:21.003 --> 02:56:23.039
PLACE THAT MAYBE THE REPORTS

02:56:23.105 --> 02:56:25.207
CAN GO TO? I WANTED TO JUST PUT

02:56:25.274 --> 02:56:27.476
THAT OUT THERE FOR PROBABLY

02:56:27.543 --> 02:56:30.212
PROBLEMATIC CONTENT. ANY

02:56:30.279 --> 02:56:32.081
THOUGHTS ON THAT? OR MAYBE TO

02:56:32.148 --> 02:56:34.150
THE CSU? I THINK THERE'S AN

02:56:34.216 --> 02:56:36.953
OPENING THERE. YES, ABSOLUTELY.

02:56:37.019 --> 02:56:43.359
ONE THAT IT. I WOULD LOVE TO

02:56:43.426 --> 02:56:45.094
TAKE A LOOK AT HOW THAT MIGHT

02:56:45.161 --> 02:56:47.063
THAT MIGHT WORK. AND I KNOW

02:56:47.129 --> 02:56:48.831
THAT THERE'S A NUMBER OF

02:56:48.898 --> 02:56:51.167

02:56:52.401 --> 02:56:53.936
INTERESTED IN WHAT WE'RE DOING

02:56:54.003 --> 02:56:56.505
IN THAT SPACE IN GENERAL, AND

02:56:56.572 --> 02:56:58.975
CERTAINLY WOULD ADD. THANK YOU

UNION OF EDUCATORS AND

02:57:45.955 --> 02:57:46.856
CLASSIFIED PROFESSIONALS,

02:57:46.922 --> 02:57:48.057
APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:57:48.124 --> 02:57:50.059
TESTIFY TODAY. I JUST WANTED TO

02:57:50.126 --> 02:57:51.160
CLARIFY, WE DON'T REPRESENT

02:57:51.227 --> 02:57:52.028
WORKERS AT CSU, BUT VERY MUCH

02:57:52.094 --> 02:57:53.295
WANTED TO STAND IN SOLIDARITY

02:57:53.362 --> 02:57:55.297
WITH THEM AND SHARE A LOT OF

02:57:55.364 --> 02:57:56.499
THE CONCERNS THAT THEY RAISED

02:57:56.565 --> 02:57:58.467
ABOUT THE INTRODUCTION OF THIS

02:57:58.534 --> 02:57:59.301
TECHNOLOGY. WE HEAR IDENTICAL

02:57:59.368 --> 02:58:00.903
CONCERNS FROM OUR MEMBERS, BOTH

02:58:00.970 --> 02:58:02.505
IN THE HIGHER ED SYSTEM AND IN

02:58:02.571 --> 02:58:04.373
TC 12, ABOUT THIS TECHNOLOGY

02:58:04.440 --> 02:58:05.007
REALLY BEING FORCED ON WORKERS

02:58:05.074 --> 02:58:07.076
AND STUDENTS WITH LITTLE TO NO

02:58:07.143 --> 02:58:08.210
COORDINATION WITH THEM OR

02:58:08.277 --> 02:58:10.012
MEANINGFUL REVIEW FROM THEM OR

02:58:10.079 --> 02:58:11.013
THEIR REPRESENTATIVES WITH

02:58:11.080 --> 02:58:12.248
PREDICTABLY CONCERNING RESULTS.

02:58:12.314 --> 02:58:14.050
AND WE WOULD STRONGLY URGE THAT

02:58:14.116 --> 02:58:16.085
NOT ONLY SHOULD WORKERS BE

02:58:16.152 --> 02:58:17.820
INVOLVED IN THIS, BUT IT REALLY

02:58:17.887 --> 02:58:20.322
SHOULD START AND END WITH THE

02:58:20.389 --> 02:58:21.424
PERSPECTIVE OF WORKERS AND

02:58:21.490 --> 02:58:22.124
STUDENTS, AND THAT IF THIS

02:58:22.191 --> 02:58:23.025
TECHNOLOGY IS NOT GOING TO WORK

02:58:23.092 --> 02:58:24.994
FOR THEM, THEN MAYBE IT

02:58:25.061 --> 02:58:26.028
SHOULDN'T BE INTRODUCED IN A

02:58:26.095 --> 02:58:27.863
GIVEN CONTEXT. AND THERE IS

02:58:27.930 --> 02:58:29.298
ALSO A REAL CONCERN HERE THAT

02:58:29.365 --> 02:58:31.233
WAS ALSO TOUCHED ON BY SOME OF

02:58:31.300 --> 02:58:32.134
THE PANELISTS, WHERE WE'VE SEEN

02:58:32.201 --> 02:58:34.036
A LOT OF SCHOOLS SPEND A LOT OF

02:58:34.103 --> 02:58:36.105
MONEY INTRODUCING A GIVEN FORM

02:58:36.172 --> 02:58:37.640
OF TECHNOLOGY, ONLY TO FIND

02:58:37.706 --> 02:58:38.240
THAT IT DIDN'T WORK, AND THEN

02:58:38.307 --> 02:58:40.543
IT'S WITHDRAWN AND ALL THAT

02:58:40.609 --> 02:58:41.343
MONEY COULD HAVE GONE TO A MUCH

02:58:41.410 --> 02:58:42.878
MORE POSITIVE PURPOSE. SO WE

02:58:42.945 --> 02:58:44.113
WOULD REALLY URGE NOT JUST

02:58:44.180 --> 02:58:45.314
CENTERING WORKERS AND STUDENTS

02:58:45.381 --> 02:58:46.982
IN THIS, BUT STARTING WITH THEM

02:58:47.049 --> 02:58:48.150
AND MAKING SURE THAT IT WORKS

02:58:48.217 --> 02:58:49.819
FOR THEM, AND THAT KEY

02:58:49.885 --> 02:58:51.420
PRINCIPLES LIKE IT IS NOT GOING

02:58:51.487 --> 02:58:53.155
TO REPLACE WORKERS, WHERE SOME

02:58:53.222 --> 02:58:54.123
OF THOSE DEVELOPING THIS

02:58:54.190 --> 02:58:54.957
TECHNOLOGY ARE PRETTY OPEN

02:58:55.024 --> 02:58:56.158
ABOUT THAT BEING THE GOAL. AND

02:58:56.225 --> 02:58:58.160
THEN IT'S ALSO NOT GOING TO

02:58:58.227 --> 02:58:58.994
HARM THE CRITICAL THINKING

02:58:59.061 --> 02:59:00.463
ABILITIES OF STUDENTS. SOME OF

02:59:00.529 --> 02:59:01.997
THE DEVELOPERS ARE MUCH MORE

02:59:02.064 --> 02:59:03.199
INTERESTED IN SEEING WHAT THE

02:59:03.265 --> 02:59:05.101
TECHNOLOGY CAN DO THAN MAKING

02:59:05.167 --> 02:59:07.069
SURE THAT THERE THAT THERE

02:59:07.136 --> 02:59:08.471
AREN'T GOING TO BE HARMS THERE.

02:59:08.537 --> 02:59:10.840
WHEN YOU TALK TO THEM, THEY SAY,

02:59:10.906 --> 02:59:12.174
WELL, THAT'S THE JOB OF THE

02:59:12.241 --> 02:59:12.942
LEGISLATURE. IT'S NOT MY JOB AS

02:59:13.008 --> 02:59:14.276
A DEVELOPER OF THE TECHNOLOGY.

02:59:14.343 --> 02:59:16.178
SO WE WOULD JUST URGE THE

02:59:16.245 --> 02:59:16.912
LEGISLATURE TO KEEP THAT

02:59:16.979 --> 02:59:18.047
PERSPECTIVE IN MIND, MAKE SURE

02:59:18.114 --> 02:59:19.281
THAT WORKERS ARE PROTECTED AND

02:59:19.348 --> 02:59:21.083
THAT THE NEEDS OF WORKERS AND

02:59:21.150 --> 02:59:22.051
STUDENTS DRIVE THIS

02:59:22.118 --> 02:59:23.052
CONVERSATION. THANK YOU. THANK

02:59:23.119 --> 02:59:28.424
YOU SO MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON.

02:59:28.491 --> 02:59:30.159
THANK YOU FOR CONVENING THIS

02:59:30.226 --> 02:59:31.927
PANEL. I'M KEVIN WIENER,

02:59:31.994 --> 02:59:33.496
PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGY AT THE

02:59:33.562 --> 02:59:35.965
SACRAMENTO CAMPUS. YOU ASKED

02:59:36.031 --> 02:59:38.067
ABOUT REPLACEMENT AND SUGGESTED

02:59:38.134 --> 02:59:39.935
THAT THAT WAS IMPONDERABLE. IT

02:59:40.002 --> 02:59:42.071
IS ACTUALLY WHAT KEEPS ME UP AT

02:59:42.138 --> 02:59:44.140
NIGHT. WE HAD ON MY CAMPUS A

02:59:44.206 --> 02:59:45.174
MANAGER WHO HAD A LITTLE BIT

02:59:45.241 --> 02:59:48.577
TOO MUCH TIME ON HIS HANDS, AND

02:59:48.644 --> 02:59:49.378
SO HE STARTED CREATING

02:59:49.445 --> 02:59:52.414
DIFFERENT BOTS USING AI,

02:59:52.481 --> 02:59:53.816
INCLUDING A CONTRACT

02:59:53.883 --> 02:59:57.119
INTERPRETATION BOT WHERE HE FED

02:59:57.186 --> 03:00:00.356
THE FACULTY CONTRACT INTO A BOT,

03:00:00.422 --> 03:00:02.558
AND THEN YOU COULD QUERY IT TO

03:00:02.625 --> 03:00:05.628
GET ADVICE ON HOW TO INTERPRET

03:00:05.694 --> 03:00:08.063
THE CONTRACT. WE GOT THAT TAKEN

03:00:08.130 --> 03:00:10.933
DOWN, BUT BEFORE THAT WE TRIED

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:13.202
IT AND IT GAVE REALLY BAD

03:00:13.269 --> 03:00:16.272
ADVICE. THIS SAME FELLOW ALSO

03:00:16.338 --> 03:00:20.209
CREATED TUTORIAL BOTS FOR FOR

03:00:20.276 --> 03:00:23.479
CLASSES. THAT IS CLEARLY THE

03:00:23.546 --> 03:00:25.481
WORK OF GRADUATE STUDENT

03:00:25.548 --> 03:00:27.516
ASSISTANTS. SO WORK REPLACEMENT

03:00:27.583 --> 03:00:30.219
IS ABSOLUTELY A THING. THE THE

03:00:30.286 --> 03:00:33.122
SINE QUA NON OF IT WAS A

03:00:33.189 --> 03:00:33.889
CONCORDIA UNIVERSITY ART

03:00:33.956 --> 03:00:35.991
HISTORY PROFESSOR. YOU CAN

03:00:36.058 --> 03:00:37.693
GOOGLE THIS TO SEE THE NEWS

03:00:37.760 --> 03:00:41.363
STORIES, HIS RECORDED LECTURES

03:00:41.430 --> 03:00:43.132
WERE CONTINUED TO BE USED AND

03:00:43.199 --> 03:00:45.734
HIS CLASS WAS TAUGHT, AND HE

03:00:45.801 --> 03:00:48.103
HAD BEEN DEAD FOR FOUR YEARS.

03:00:48.170 --> 03:00:50.105
HE DIED IN 2019 AND HIS COURSE

03:00:50.172 --> 03:00:52.741
WAS TAUGHT THROUGH THE PANDEMIC.

03:00:52.808 --> 03:00:55.110
SO YEAH, IT'S THE KIND OF THING

03:00:55.177 --> 03:00:57.880
THAT I WORRY ABOUT A LOT. THANK

03:00:57.947 --> 03:01:01.050

SPEAKING WITH CLARITY AND

03:01:29.411 --> 03:01:31.313
CONVICTION ON THE TOPIC. LIKE

03:01:31.380 --> 03:01:32.081
ANY NEW DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY,

03:01:32.147 --> 03:01:35.618
I PRESENTS BOTH PROMISE AND

03:01:35.684 --> 03:01:37.286
PERIL. USERS NEED RELEVANT AND

03:01:37.353 --> 03:01:38.287
TIMELY TRAINING ON THE

03:01:38.354 --> 03:01:39.154
TECHNOLOGY ITSELF, AND LEADERS

03:01:39.221 --> 03:01:41.090
NEED TO HAVE THE TIME AND

03:01:41.156 --> 03:01:42.157
FORUMS TO TRANSPARENTLY

03:01:42.224 --> 03:01:42.992
CONSIDER HOW THESE TOOLS

03:01:43.058 --> 03:01:44.093
INTEGRATION CAN WORK. AND TODAY

03:01:44.159 --> 03:01:46.095
WE'VE HAD THAT REALLY ROBUST

03:01:46.161 --> 03:01:47.196
DISCUSSION HERE TODAY AS A

03:01:47.263 --> 03:01:48.097
STARTING POINT AND REALLY A

03:01:48.163 --> 03:01:50.199
DEEP DIVE INTO A NUMBER OF THE

03:01:50.266 --> 03:01:51.300
RECOMMENDATIONS AND OTHER AREAS

03:01:51.367 --> 03:01:53.068
THAT WE CAN LOOK INTO. AND WE

03:01:53.135 --> 03:01:55.771
KNOW THE ETHICAL USE OF THESE

03:01:55.838 --> 03:01:56.572
TECHNOLOGIES IS PARAMOUNT AND

03:01:56.639 --> 03:01:57.139
IMPORTANT. SO THOUGHTFULLY

03:01:57.206 --> 03:01:59.041
CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF THIS

03:01:59.108 --> 03:02:00.476
TECHNOLOGY IN OUR CLASSROOMS,

03:02:00.542 --> 03:02:01.010
IN OUR WORKPLACES, AND IN

03:02:01.076 --> 03:02:03.178

CONCERNS AND ALSO ABOUT THE

03:02:06.482 --> 03:02:08.217
ROLLOUT, BUT ALSO LOOKING AT

03:02:08.284 --> 03:02:09.885
MAKING SURE THAT THE SAFETY IS

03:02:09.952 --> 03:02:11.387
PARAMOUNT, LOOKING AT SYSTEM

03:02:11.453 --> 03:02:12.454
